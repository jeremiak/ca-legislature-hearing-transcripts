I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD

00:36:04.161 --> 00:36:05.696
CARE MEMBERS I'M THIS PROPOSAL

00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:06.831
REALLY IS ABOUT BETTER

00:36:06.898 --> 00:36:08.966
CONNECTING THE INVESTMENTS OF

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:10.535
THESE HOSPITALS TO THE COMMUNITY

NEEDS AND TO THE- COMMUNITIES

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:14.272
AND WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS.

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:16.107
ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION IS

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:17.341
WHAT TO THE HOSPITAL'S NOW SPEND

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:19.443
THESE FUNDS ON NOW. THE TRUTH IS

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.778
THEY SPEND ABOUT SIX BILLION

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:24.315
DOLLARS A YEAR AND I'M- ON. THE

00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:26.250
BENEFITS AND THAT INCLUDES ABOUT

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.920
FOUR BILLION WHICH IS REALLY-

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:30.488
UNCOMPENSATED CARE INCLUDING

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:31.989
CHARITY CARE AND THAT IS THINGS

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.691
LIKE MEDICARE. MEDICARE AND

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:35.526
MEDICAID ALL SHORTFALLS AS WELL

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:37.094
AS- INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:40.197
INSURANCE. I AM RIGHT NOW THEY

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:41.532
SEND THEY SUBMIT QUALITATIVE

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.034
REPORTS NOT NECESSARILY

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.069
QUANTITATIVE THAT GO INTO THE

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:47.004
DETAIL OF EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:48.873
SPENDING ON WHICH INVESTMENTS

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.475
AND SO WHAT WE- BELIEVE IS THAT

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:53.077
MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:54.579
SPENDING SOME OF THESE BONDS IN

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:56.414
THE AREAS THAT WE MOST WOULD

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.848
WANT TO SEE THEM SPEND MY MEN.

00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.417
AND ADDRESSING SOCIAL

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:01.152
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BUT WE

00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:02.853
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.989
THAT TWO BILLION THAT IS NOT THE

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.657
UNCOMPENSATED CARE REALLY IS

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:08.426
GOING TO THIS EFFORT. AND SO

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.027
REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:12.863
IS TO GET MORE TRANSPARENCY AND

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.299
WITH THIS LIMITED INFORMATION. I

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:17.268
CAN'T REALLY TELL WHAT AREAS ARE

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:18.502
GETTING THE MOST INVESTMENTS

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.771
WHAT THEY'RE INVESTING IN AND SO

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:22.707
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:23.941
FIRST STEP IS COLLECTING THAT

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:26.277
INFORMATION AND THEN THE SECOND

00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:28.679
STEP IS SORT OF MAKING SURE THAT

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:29.780
THEY ARE GOING TO THE CBO

00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:31.015
BECAUSE- I'M- AN TO UPPER

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:31.983
INVESTORS THAT WILL MAKE SURE

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:33.451
THAT WE ARE. ALIGNING THE

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:38.022
COMMUNITY NEEDS- WITH THE

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:39.857
INVESTMENTS. I'M SO TO A-

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:40.992
REPRESENTATIVES OF HAAS HAVE

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:42.760
THAT THEY ALREADY CLOSELY WITH

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.729
COMMUNITIES. AND SO WE THINK

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:45.830
THAT THAT VARIES ACROSS THE

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:47.832
STATE AND THAT THERE ARE INDEED

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:49.100
SOME HOSPITALS THAT WORK VERY

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.701
CLOSELY WITH. THE LOCAL HEALTH

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:51.736
JURISDICTIONS COMMUNITY

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:53.704
ASSESSMENTS WORK WITH C. B. I

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:55.773
WAS ON THE GROUND I BET IT ONE

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.174
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:59.210
TO DO IS REALLY TO. LEVERAGE

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:01.212
THESE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:02.113
ADDRESSING THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:04.081
MOST IN NEED BUT THEN THE

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:05.883
HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA AND

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.951
HOSPITALS DUE TO FIND THEIR

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:09.053
SERVICE AREA DIFFERENTLY AND SO

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.721
WE WANT TO MAYBE EXPAND ON THAT

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.723
SERVICE ORDERED. A SERVICE AREA

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.659
DEFINITION SO THAT WE REALLY CAN

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:15.993
REACH THOSE AREAS OF THE

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.695

AND IMPACT OF THESE INVESTMENTS

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.370
SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT'S

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:27.204
WORKING ON SOME OF THESE

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:29.573
COMMUNITIES AND BE ABLE TO SCALE

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.409

STARTING POINT FOR THE SINCE

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:49.099
NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. THE IRISH

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:51.435
RULING THAT. BUT THAT BASICALLY

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:53.337
OUTLINED THE CONCEPT OF THE

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:55.205
PROMOTION OF HEALTH EXPANDING

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:57.675

A VARIETY OF MORE DETAILED

00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:21.598
REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER I WOULD

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:23.334
NOTE THAT MANY OF THOSE

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.301
REQUIREMENTS IF ANYTHING HAVE

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.337
ADDED CONFUSION RATHER THAN

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.905
CLARITY TO HELP NONPROFIT

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:29.506
HOSPITALS. MEET THESE

00:43:29.573 --> 00:43:31.809
OBLIGATIONS AND THEN A NUMBER OF

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:34.611
EFFORTS AND ENDS IN OTHER STATES

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.647
AS WELL AS IN OUR OWN STATE BOTH

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:38.182
CURRENT CREATES A FOCUS ON

00:43:38.248 --> 00:43:40.184
EQUITY AND TO PROVIDE MORE

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.219
DETAIL. EXPECTATIONS WITH

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:46.156
OBSTACLES- MUCH OF THIS- WORK AS

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:48.726
REALLY JUST FOCUSED ON HOW MUCH

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:50.661
HOSPITALS ARE PROVIDED RATHER

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.162
THAN REALLY DIGGING INTO THE

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.098
QUALITY OF THE INVESTMENTS AND

00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:55.666
TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE REALLY

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.368
FOCUSED. ON THE PROFOUND

00:43:57.434 --> 00:43:59.703
INEQUITIES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.306
CANDIDATES- WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:04.074
MOST EXPENDITURES INCLUDING.

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:05.676
MEDICAID SHORTFALLS IN HEALTH

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:06.710
PROFESSIONS EDUCATION

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:08.545
EXPENDITURES BY HOSPITAL'S

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:09.713
CURRENT SPENDING ON SOCIAL

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.582
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IS QUITE

00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:14.251
SMALL SO THE PROPOSAL ONE OF THE

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.953
FACE OF IT IS IT IS AN

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.788
IMPORTANT. MOMENT IN THE RIGHT

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.356
DIRECTION PARTICULARLY GIVEN

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:20.758
THAT HOSPITALS ARE ASSEMBLY

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:28.365
INCREASING RATES FOR KEEPING.

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:29.533
PEOPLE HEALTHY AND OUT OF THEIR

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.401
INSTITUTIONS- IT'S OF TO.

00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:32.002
HOWEVER THAT IF IT NUMBER OF

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:34.238
WHAT IS WRITTEN. FOR EXAMPLE WE

00:44:34.304 --> 00:44:35.506
THE FORM MEDICARE OUR- SHORTFALL

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:36.673
. IS ACTUALLY THE EMERGENCY ROOM

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:37.941
AND INPATIENT TREATMENT OF

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:39.777
PREVENTABLE CONDITION. SO

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:41.111
BEGINNING TO MATURE SHIFT

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:44.381
INVESTMENTS UPSTREAM IS

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:46.550
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. HOWEVER

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.619
AMONG THE MANY CHALLENGES IN

00:44:48.685 --> 00:44:49.586
IMPLEMENTING THIS KIND OF

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.789
LEGISLATION AS UNDERSTANDING THE

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.424
PROFOUND DIVERSITY OF THE

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.359
HEALTHCARE SECTOR ITSELF. SAFETY

00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:57.294
NET HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR IN

00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:00.864
OUR URBAN SETTINGS HOW MUCH LESS

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:02.132
FAVORABLE PAYER METHODS THANK

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:04.568
HAD A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:07.204
PUBLIC PAY OF PATIENTS THAT HAVE

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.873
LOWER MARGINS OF THEY HAVE A LOT

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.009
MORE LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THEIR

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:13.777
EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND MAKES IT

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:16.513
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.581
WHILE THEY HAVE GREATER

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.283
SENSITIVITY THE MANY CHALLENGES

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.885
FACED BY THESE POPULATIONS THEY

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.887
HAVE THE LEAST DISCRETIONARY-

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:25.756
REVENUE TO BE ABLE TO ALLOCATE

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:28.859
FOR THESE PURPOSES SO WE HAVE TO

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:30.627
TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:32.396
TEACHING HOSPITALS- OF SPEND A

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:34.431
SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THEIR

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:36.500
COMMITTEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS-

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.535
IT IN QUATERNARY AND TERTIARY

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.838
CARE FOR THIS POPULATION AS WELL

00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:43.140
AS HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:45.776
SHORTFALLS. SEVERAL HOSPITALS

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:47.377
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:48.779
THEIR VERY LIMITED MARGINS

00:45:48.846 --> 00:45:51.148
DIRECTED TOWARDS DIRECT SERVICES

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:52.850
SUBSIDIZED SERVICES DENTAL

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:56.687
SERVICES- OF BIRD WARDS OVER AN

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:59.923
ARRAY OF SPECIALTY CARE IT WOULD

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:01.291
OTHERWISE BE UNAVAILABLE FOR

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:03.794
THOSE POPULATIONS. IT HAS

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:05.429
ALREADY BEEN REFERENCE THERE'S

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.364
IN THE METALAC OF CLARITY IN THE

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:10.100
CURRENT IRS REPORTING CATEGORIES

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:11.802
A LOT OF THINGS ARE REPORTED

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:13.504
THAT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T MANY

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.572
OTHERS ARE NOT REPORTED BECAUSE

00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:17.007
THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:18.842
WHERE THEY BELONG. SO TO THE

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:21.078
DEGREE THAT ANY PROPOSAL SUCH AS

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.546
THIS IS A PLUMMETED REQUIRES

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:24.615
SOME SOME RIGOROUS EFFORT TO

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:25.949
STRENGTHEN THE REPORTING

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:29.086
CATEGORIES- THEN IT'S IMPORTANT

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:30.888
TO RECOGNIZE THAT TO THE DEGREE

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:33.524
THAT WE REQUIRE SPENDING IN SOME

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.226
AREAS IT MAY CHALLENGE THOSE FOR

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:38.061
NON EMERGENT CARE. FOR

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.196
HEALTHCARE SERVICES MENTAL

THIS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TIME

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:49.740
IT PUTS AN ADDITIONAL. STRAIN ON

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.942
HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE THE AS-

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.911
THAT HAVING BEEN SAID- ALTHOUGH

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.179

L. IT TRYING THE IN MOVING

00:47:00.384 --> 00:47:03.153
TOWARD A TOP FOUR TO THIS OF THE

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.421
THAT IT WILL INCLUDE COMMITTEE

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:06.490

THIS IS A PRIORITY ENABLES US TO

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:13.263
SPEND QUITE A BIT MORE IN THAT

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.432
AREA. H. BECAUSE I HAVE A WEALTH

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:18.569
OF DATA- THAT WE COULD- PUT

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:21.572
UNDER G. I. S. ANALYSIS- AND BE

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:24.441
ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUB GEOGRAPHIES

QUITE CLEAR WHERE WE CAN DIRECT-

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.563
BECAUSE THE MASSIVE SUPPORT

OF A OF A THE WITH CDC. THAT

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:33.176

COMMUNITIES. THAT SAID THAT

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.822
PROPOSAL ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT

00:51:31.888 --> 00:51:32.789
TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY AND

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:34.458

SUSTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. WE

INFRASTRUCTURE. COMMUNITY BASED

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:09.326
ORGANIZATIONS PLAY THREE

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:10.660
CRITICAL ROLES IN ADVANCING

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:12.195
PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS REDUCING

DISPARITIES AND PROMOTING RACIAL

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.466
JUSTICE. THEY MAKE THE INVISIBLE

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:18.435
VISIBLE THEY BUILD BRIDGES AND

THE INNOVATE TO TRANSFORM

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.939
SYSTEMS TO ALIGN WITH COMMUNITY

00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:24.541
NEEDS AND PRIORITIES. FIRST ON

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.343
MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:27.878
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.679
HAVE ARISEN OUT OF UNMET NEED

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.348
OFTEN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT

00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:32.482
ARE MADE INVISIBLE BY OUR

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:34.951
SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES DUE TO

00:52:35.018 --> 00:52:36.186
THEIR SIZE OR LACK OF POLITICAL

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:38.054
POWER. FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:39.456
PANDEMIC PACIFIC ISLANDERS

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.191
EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST CASE AND

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:42.993
DEATH RATES OF ANY RACIAL GROUP.

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:45.228
YET DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:46.129

RESPONSE PACIFIC ISLANDER

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:54.170
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITY BASED

00:52:54.237 --> 00:52:56.239
ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZED AND

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:57.841
BUILT A STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.976
THAT ADVOCATED FOR THEIR NEEDS.

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:00.911

PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND MOST

00:53:10.554 --> 00:53:13.256
IMPORTANTLY PROVIDED HOPE DURING

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:14.824
A PERIOD OF ISOLATION AND FEAR.

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.893
SECOND ON BUILDING BRIDGES

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.361
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:20.397
ARE ABLE TO HAVE A FOOT IN EACH

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:21.498
WORLD AND TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.266
THE STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT AND

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:25.135
THE REALITIES OF COMMUNITIES.

00:53:25.201 --> 00:53:26.603
UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES WERE

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.238
PARTICULARLY DEVASTATED BY THE

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:30.640
PANDEMIC BUT ALSO ISOLATED FROM

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.008
THE RESOURCES OF GOVERNMENT DUE

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:33.810
TO FEAR OF IMMIGRATION

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:35.378
CONSEQUENCES. COMMUNITY BASED

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:36.279
ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:38.248
STATE STUDENTS GAP ACTING AS

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:40.450
TRUSTED MESSENGERS TO BRING PP

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:41.618
FINANCIAL RELIEF AND OTHER

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:43.320
RESOURCES TO UNDOCUMENTED

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:45.088
COMMUNITIES. ALLOWING LOCAL

00:53:48.925 --> 00:53:50.026
WHO OTHERWISE MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:51.461
OUT. FINALLY AND MOST

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.129
IMPORTANTLY ON INNOVATING TO

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:54.731
TRANSFORM SYSTEMS TO ALIGN WITH

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:56.800
COMMUNITY PRIORITIES. AFTER THE

00:53:56.866 --> 00:53:58.501
LAST TWO YEARS I THINK IT IS

00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.737
CLEAR TO ALL OF US WHO VALUE

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.838
EQUITY. THAT WE CANNOT GO BACK

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:03.673
TO HER PRE PANDEMIC NORMAL.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.075
INSTEAD WE MUST INNOVATE AND

00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:06.910
TRANSFORM TO ELIMINATE RACIAL

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:09.079
AND OTHER INEQUITIES COMMUNITY

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:10.580
BASED ORGANIZATIONS HOLD SYSTEMS

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:12.282
ACCOUNTABLE. ENSURE

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:14.584
PARTICIPATION IN DEMOCRACY AND

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:16.653
DEVELOP NEW AND CREATIVE IDEAS

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.388
TO SOLVE SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE

00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:20.590
SOCIETAL PROBLEMS. IT IS THIS

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.092
ROLE THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:23.426
THROUGH THE RACIAL JUSTICE

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:25.462
INNOVATION PORTION OF THE FUND.

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:26.796
WE MUST BE WILLING TO INVEST IN

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:28.431
NEW IDEAS AND EXPERIMENTS AND

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:30.033
COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO EFFECT

GENERATIONAL IMPACT OF SYSTEMIC

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:35.639
RACISM. BY FILLING THESE THREE

00:54:35.705 --> 00:54:37.040
CRITICAL ROLES COMMUNITY BASED

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.441
ORGANIZATIONS COMPLEMENT AND

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:39.743
EXTEND THE REACH OF LOCAL

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:41.544
GOVERNMENTAL AND STATE PUBLIC

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.413
HEALTH EFFORTS. WHILE MANY LOCAL

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.848
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RECOGNIZE

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:46.282
THIS AND ACTIVELY PARTNER WITH

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:48.018
CBO'S AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:49.552
NEXT SPEAKER. IT IS AN

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.087
UNFORTUNATE REALITY THAT NOT ALL

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:52.522
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:55.392
THE SUPPORT OF THEIR BOARDS OF

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:55.959
SUPERVISORS TO DO SO. THERE

00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:57.260
COUNTIES IN THE STATE WHERE

00:54:57.327 --> 00:54:58.261
PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS

00:54:58.328 --> 00:54:59.562
THAT SUPPORT UNDOCUMENTED

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:00.764
COMMUNITIES COULD NOT BE

01:01:16.039 --> 01:01:17.407
CARE. IS THE PERFECT BREEDING

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.075
GROUND FOR COAL BUT- OUR

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:20.877
VULNERABILITY HOWEVER IS THE

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.412
STATE'S VULERABILITY THE VALLEY

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:23.980
REPRESENTS 1% OF THE

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.748
AGRICULTURAL FARMLAND IN THE US

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:28.484
BUT WE PRODUCE OVER 25% OF ALL

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.353
THE TABLE FOOD BE. CALIFORNIA'S

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.355
FOOD SUPPLY LITERALLY DEPENDS ON

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:33.790
THE FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS OF

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.658
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THESE

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.193
DATA POINTS HOWEVER ALSO POINT

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.494
TO THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:40.363
IN PREVENTION TO BUILD HEALTHIER

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.198
AND MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES.

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:43.199
PROMOTING HEALTH IS NOT

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:45.268
SOMETHING YOU DO IN A CRISIS

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:46.369
IT'S AN INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:48.438
TO CONTRIBUTE TO CONSISTENTLY WE

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:51.874
CAN CULTIVATE GOOD HEALTH BUT WE

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:54.177
NEED THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. AS

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.578
I MENTIONED HAS BEEN IN

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.280
EXISTENCE SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.648
FIVE BUT IT'S BEEN ONLY BECAUSE

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:00.683
OF MONUMENTAL LINKS TO PIECE

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.451
TOGETHER FUNDING STREAMS OF THE

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:04.654
NONPROFIT. WE GAIN RESOURCES WE

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.289
BUILT UP STAFF AND THEN THE

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:07.890
GRANTS AND THEN WE HAVE TO LET

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.859
STAFF GO AND SUSPEND ACTIVITIES

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.727
UNTIL FUNDING CAN BE IDENTIFIED

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.197
AND SECURED AGAIN. HAVING AN

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:15.865
UNSTABLE SOURCE THE FUNDING HAS

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:19.168
BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SUCCESS

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.904
. ONE EXAMPLE TO SHOWCASE- THIS

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:22.805
CHALLENGES OUR VENDORS FOR

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.240
HEALTH PROJECT THROUGH THIS

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:26.109
PROJECT WE PARTNERED WITH OTHER

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:27.844
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.545
ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY KITCHEN WE

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:32.181
TRAINED MOBILE VENDORS- WE TRAIN

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.649
THEM IN PARTICULAR TO OFFER

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:37.286
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES- TO HELP-

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:39.622
SPREAD. ACCESS TO HEALTHIER

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:41.390
FOODS INCLUDED SECURING

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:43.226
NEIGHBORHOODS. AND SO THIS MEANT

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:45.828
THAT WE HAD TO WORK WITH THEM SO

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:46.929
THAT THEY COULD BE LICENSED AND

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:48.397
PERMITTED SO THAT THEY COULD

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.398
PASS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH.

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.334
REQUIREMENTS AND GAIN FOOD

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.536
HANDLING CERTIFICATION THE

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.605
PROJECT OPERATED AS A PILOT WITH

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.440
REALLY GOOD SUCCESS HOWEVER OUR

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.841
NONPROFIT PARTNER LOST THEIR

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.676
FUNDING AND ULTIMATELY THE LEASE

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.345
ON THE KITCHEN. THAT WE HAVE

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:04.780
WORK TO ESTABLISH- THE PROJECT

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.516
COULD NO LONGER OPERATE WITHOUT

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.317
ACCESS TO A CERTIFIED COMMUNITY

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:10.553
KITCHEN AND SO I USE THAT STORY

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.156
TO DESCRIBE- JUST HOW DIFFICULT

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.790
IT IS- IN THE NONPROFIT

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:17.093
COMMUNITY. TO REALLY SUSTAIN

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.896
INNOVATIVE PROJECTS THAT HAVE A

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.998
LOT OF PROMISE. IN THE PAST TWO

01:03:22.064 --> 01:03:25.301
YEARS- WE HAVE HAD TO FIGHT FOR

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:27.103
FUNDING WITH KERIS ACT IN ORDER

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.804
TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS IN

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:30.039
PARTICULAR IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:31.874
COMMUNITY MEMBER CENTER COALBED.

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:34.043
WE ARE HAVING ALSO TO FIGHT FOR

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.312
FUNDING FOR ARPA AT WE'VE BEEN

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:37.847
DENIED FUNDING MANY TIMES

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.815
BECAUSE OF LOCAL POLITICS HI

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.217
THIS IS TRUE IN MANY OF THE

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:42.919
COUNTIES HERE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.187
VALLEY WHERE THE BOARD OF

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.588
SUPERVISORS DO NOT REFLECT. THE

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.490
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.458
WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO SERVE.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:50.993
AND NO ONE'S HEALTH SHOULD

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.361
REALLY BE UNDERMINED BECAUSE

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.197
THEY DO NOT HOLD THIS POLITICAL

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:57.133
POWER- AND IN THE ABSENCE OF

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.001
EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION IN

01:03:59.068 --> 01:04:00.937
THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE NEED

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.939
TO BE MORE EQUITABLE IN THE WAY

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.675
THAT FUNDING AND RESOURCES ARE

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:07.677
DISTRIBUTED. SO WITH STEADY

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.245
FUNDING TO PROMOTE HEALTH EQUITY

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:10.346
AND RACIAL JUSTICE COULD BE BY

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:12.448
LESS THAN WHO COULD. ENSURE THAT

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.716
WE HAVE LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.151
OPPORTUNITIES WITH COMPETITIVE

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.652
WAGES AMPLE BENEFITS WE COULD

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.054
SUSTAIN INTERVENTIONS THAT

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.255
REALLY HELP TO CHANGE THE FOOD

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.157
LANDSCAPE. INCLUDED SECURE

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:22.558
NEIGHBORHOODS WE COULD DIVE

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:26.429
DEEPER IN ADVOCACY- TO BRING THE

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.097
NECESSARY AND INFRASTRUCTURE

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.732
IMPROVEMENTS THAT PROMOTE DALY

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.867
IN REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WE

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.169
COULD CONTINUE IN OUR LEADERSHIP

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:34.370
DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.872
ALLOW DISADVANTAGE. I RESIDENTS

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:39.141
TO BE AGENTS FOR CHANGE- WE

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:41.577
COULD HELP TO PROMOTE PREVENTION

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:42.878
WE COULD HELP TO ESTABLISH

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.280
HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND WE COULD

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:45.248
DEFINITELY HAVE A GREATER

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:49.318
IMPACT. AND HEALTH EQUITY. AND

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.319

ESTABLISHED AND FOR THE DOLLARS

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:07.270
TO BE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED TO

01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:09.472

DÍAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.013
QUESTIONS. SEEING NINE I WILL

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:18.981

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.953
PRIVILEGE AND REALLY APPRECIATE

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.222

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.190
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH DURING

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.293
THIS LAST PANDEMIC. IT WAS JUST

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:32.428
ABOUT A YEAR AGO THAT SHE AND I

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:34.597
WERE WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.732
IN PLACES LIKE ORANGE COVE.

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:39.669
DELRAY AND BY ALL WHICH HAPPENS

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:42.171
TO BE THE MOST VACCINATED. SMALL

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.106
CITY UNINCORPORATED CITY WE HAD

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:46.042
AN FRESNO COUNTY IT COULD NOT

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:46.676
HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT THE

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:49.345
PARTNERSHIP OF THOSE. CBO'S WHO

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:50.880
ARE THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS ON

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:52.515

SURE DO APPRECIATE YOU ABOUT

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:56.652

ORGANIZATION THIS TIME. WITH

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:01.157
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN MY

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.558
FIRST QUESTION TO THE

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:06.295
ADMINISTRATION. IT SEEMS THAT-

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.097
SUSAN FINALE HAD SAID THAT WE

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:10.466
NEED BETTER TRANSPARENCY

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.702
REGARDING THESE DOLLARS THAT WE

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.570
NEED TO SEE MORE OF A COLLECTIVE

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.640
IMPACT ON THE GROUND THAT I'D

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:18.874
FIRST LIKE TO ASK THE

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.776
ADMINISTRATION IF THEY BELIEVE

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:22.978
ANYTHING IS CURRENTLY MISSING.

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.114
FROM THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:31.153
PROGRAM FUNDING. AND AND IF SO-

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:39.829
CAN YOU IDENTIFY WHAT THAT IS. I

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.330
THINK I'LL I'LL START AND I'LL

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:42.898
TURN IT BACK TO SCOTT BUT I

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.900
THINK WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:46.402
TO THAT GIVEN THAT THAT THAT

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.604
DATA IS NOT GRANULAR ENOUGH FOR

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.706
US TO SEE HOW MUCH IS INVESTED

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:53.209
IN WHICH AREAS WE KNOW THAT WE

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:54.710
ARE NOT INVESTING IN SOME OF THE

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.679
HIGHEST RISK AREAS AND WE KNOW

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.647
THAT NOT ALL HOSPITALS ARE

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:00.049
ENGAGING COMMUNITY BASED

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:03.052
ORGANIZATIONS SO SETTING UP OUR

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:05.187
OF 25% TO GO TO DIRECTLY TO

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.056
CEOS. TO GET THAT TRUSTED

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:08.858
MESSENGER TO GET TO THOSE

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.359
COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK BUT I

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:11.727
THINK THAT'S PART OF THE

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:13.963
TRANSPARENCY ISSUE IS WE WANT TO

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:16.031
SEE EXACTLY HOW MUCH AS BEING

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:17.900
ABOUT SEVEN WHERE AND SOME OF

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:19.435
THE REPORTS THAT WE HAVE DON'T

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.170
GO TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL. NOT

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:22.905
SCOTT IF YOU WANT TO ADD

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:24.740
ANYTHING MORE FINANCES I WANT TO

THANK YOU SUIT JUST JUST IT TOOK

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:27.843
TO REPORT THAT'S CORRECT IT'S

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:28.844
ESSENTIALLY WE DON'T KNOW WE

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:30.813
DON'T KNOW THE NATURE OF THE

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.114
COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS REPORTED

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:33.482
IN CALIFORNIA TODAY ARE ARE

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.851
ESSENTIALLY QUALITATIVE- THERE'S

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:38.354
NO STANDARDIZED REQUIRED FORMAT

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.656
SO IN SOME CASES- THERE WELL

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.091
FLESHED OUT AND WE CAN WE CAN

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:43.526
SEE WHERE THESE THESE- THESE

01:07:43.592 --> 01:07:44.827
BENEFITS ARE BEING SPENT OTHER

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.495
CASES WE CAN'T. THEY'RE NOT

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.531
COMPARABLE ACROSS THE WEEK WE

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:49.632
CAN'T DO ANY COMPARATIVE

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:52.101
ANALYSIS UP REALLY THE FIRST

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:53.903
PIECE OF THIS IS THIS TO DO

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:55.671
STANDARDIZED STRUCTURED

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.706
REPORTING ON CATEGORIES THAT WE

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.842
DEFINE TOGETHER- THROUGH RULE

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.878
MAKING PROCESS- TO GET IT THOSE

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.914
THINGS- TO KNOW WHERE THE

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.848
INVESTMENTS ARE AGAIN FROM

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.716
READING ALL OF THE REPORTS. AS A

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:09.351
STUDENT SAID IN SOME CASES WE

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.187
THINK SOME OF THIS IS HAPPENING

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.621
TODAY BUT WE CAN'T QUANTIFY AND

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:13.689
I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.724
IMPORTANT PIECE TO GET OUT IN

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:16.926
TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY IN IT AND

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:18.060
ALLOWING THE COMMUNITY TO BE

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:25.835
CLEAR. ON WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:26.902
WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING. I WILL

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.003
STAY CALL. WITHOUT NEEDING.

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:29.505
NUMBER BUT- ALL. YOU SAID THE

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:30.739
WERE SIX BILLION. FOR COMMUNITY

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:33.442
BAND FOR THE HOSPITAL AND THAT

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:34.443
FOUR BILLION OF THAT GOES INTO

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:35.044
UNCOMPENSATED CARE. WITH THE

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:37.413
SIGNIFICANT EXPANSIONS THAT ARE

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.215
EXPECTED FROM US AS A STATE OVER

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.650
THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS WHAT DO WE

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:44.186
ANTICIPATE TO HAPPEN. WITH

01:08:44.253 --> 01:08:47.423
UNCOMPENSATED. CARE AND DO WE

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.692
EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE TO BE FOUR

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:52.027
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE UPCOMING

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:57.666
YEARS. IT ALL START TO THAT SB

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:59.668
IS IT KIND OF DEMONSTRATES HOW

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:01.270
DIFFICULT IS COULD NUMBERS THOSE

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.005
THOSE DATA WERE ACTUALLY TAKEN

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.173
FROM FEDERAL TAX RETURNS THAT WE

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.941
YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THAT WAS

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.409
ACCURATE AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:13.516
IT WASN'T- FULLY. CAPTURING THE

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.751
UNDERSTAND IN IN- OF MEDICAID

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:18.354
AND MEDICARE SO WE WOULD EXPECT

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.789
I THINK FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:23.359
FOR A SORT OF MORAL TO YOUR

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:24.693
ACCOUNT IF YOU'RE A CALCULATED

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.196
WITHIN THE MANY BENEFITS. OF THE

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.632
SCHEME SO I THINK I WOULD I

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:34.603
WOULD START THERE AND- YEAH I

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.005
KNOW I ADD THE I THINK IT'S

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:37.273
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THERE'S NO

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.340
MINIMUM. AMOUNT BENEFITS

01:09:38.407 --> 01:09:39.975
PROMISED INVEST IN THEIR

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.844
COMMUNITY BENEFITS SO BECAUSE

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.045
WE'RE NOT INCLUDING

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:44.680
UNCOMPENSATED CARE IN THE

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.982
FORMULA. IT WOULDN'T CHANGE THE

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.384
INVESTMENTS POTENTIALLY THAT

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:51.220
PEOPLE ARE MAKING. FUN WE DON'T

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.222
KNOW THAT. I THINK WHAT I'M

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:55.824
TRYING TO SAY IS IF THE LEVEL OF

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:58.060
UNCOMPENSATED CARE IS NOW LOWER

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:58.928
SINCE WERE COVERING MORE

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:01.297

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:03.432

AVAILABLE AT.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:22.818
I WOULD SAY YES I THINK THE

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:25.454
QUESTION IS THAT THE LATE INTO

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:28.857
MORE INVESTMENT CAN. THIS IS.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:37.900

CHANCE TO MEET ANY OF THOSE YOU.

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:57.250

PUBLIC HEALTH IN WAYS THAT IN I

THE WORK FORCE NUMBER. BUT HOPE

01:56:26.779 --> 01:56:27.947
THAT YOU HEAR FROM THE

01:56:28.014 --> 01:56:29.749
LEGISLATURE A WILLINGNESS TO

THE NEED FOR US TO PUT THIS TO

YOU- HAVE ABOUT HOW WE- ARE

01:58:20.893 --> 01:58:23.529
LANGUAGE THANK YOU UNDER PENALTY

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:25.832
OF PERJURY AFTER- SAYING THEY

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:30.636
ARE NOT- SUPPLEMENTING EXISTING

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:33.773
PLANS. MAYBE IT. WHAT'S THE-

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.908
THEN SO I UNDERSTAND THE

01:58:35.975 --> 01:58:38.444
LANGUAGE ON THE FRONT AND- HOW

01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:42.048
AND- HAVE WE EVER ENFORCED THIS

01:58:42.114 --> 01:58:44.317
IS THIS A COMMON PRACTICE FOR US

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:48.287
TO- FOLLOW UP ON THAT LANGUAGE.

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:50.456
HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT COUNTIES

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:53.659
ARE. FOLLOWING THE LETTER OF THE

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:55.261
LAW THAT YOU'RE READY. SO IT IS

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:56.863
A REQUIREMENT IN MOST OF OUR

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:58.331
FEDERAL FUNDING- THEY DO GET

01:58:58.397 --> 01:59:02.235
AUDITED. I'M ON A ROUTINE BASIS-

01:59:02.301 --> 01:59:04.036
AND SO I THINK THAT YOU HAVE

01:59:04.103 --> 01:59:05.838
THAT THERE ARE METHODS TO REALLY

01:59:05.905 --> 01:59:08.174
LOOK AT THAT I ALSO THINK THAT

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:09.976
IT WILL BE AN EVERYONE'S BEST

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:11.811
INTEREST TO POINT OUT ANY-

01:59:11.878 --> 01:59:13.513
SUPPLEMENTATION AND PART OF

01:59:13.579 --> 01:59:15.081
WORRIES AND YOU. HAVE THIS

01:59:15.147 --> 01:59:16.983
LANGUAGE IN HERE IS SO THAT OUR

01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:18.484
LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS CAN

01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:20.586
CALL OUR ATTENTION IF NEED BE-

01:59:20.653 --> 01:59:22.321
THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY WANT

01:59:22.388 --> 01:59:25.992
TO PROTECT THESE DOLLARS AS MUCH

01:59:26.058 --> 01:59:28.327
AS POSSIBLE AS WELL. I'D LIKE TO

01:59:28.394 --> 01:59:30.062
BE ABLE TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION

01:59:30.129 --> 01:59:32.431
OF MICHELLE GIVENS IF I CAN WITH

01:59:32.498 --> 01:59:33.199
JACK. YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME

01:59:33.266 --> 01:59:35.234
COMMENTARY YEAH HAPPY TO I THINK

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:37.036
THE FIRST THING I WOULD MENTION

01:59:37.103 --> 01:59:38.404
IS THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY'RE

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:40.006
READING OFF OF THIS LANGUAGE

01:59:40.072 --> 01:59:41.040
THAT WE ALSO CRAFTED FOR THEM AS

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:43.242
WELL. SO I THINK THE FIRST AND

01:59:43.309 --> 01:59:44.410
FOREMOST THING IS THAT OUR

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:44.977
MEMBERS ARE NOT LOOKING TO

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.812
SUPPLANT. WE REALLY ARE LOOKING

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.414
TO BOLSTER WORKFORCE I THINK

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:48.981
THERE'S BEEN A WIDESPREAD

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:50.249
RECOGNITION THAT LIKE THIS IS

01:59:50.316 --> 01:59:51.784
NOT THE TIME TO GO BACKWARDS.

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:53.019
AND I THINK AND THE CHALLENGE

01:59:53.085 --> 01:59:55.354
THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST IS

01:59:55.421 --> 01:59:56.122
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:59:56.188 --> 01:59:57.557
FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUNDING THAT

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:58.824
COMES DOWN RIGHT SO. WE'RE

01:59:58.891 --> 01:59:59.959
EXCITED AND WE'RE LOOKING

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:01.294
FORWARD TO THAT THAT LANGUAGE

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.762
BEING IN THERE ALSO TELLS THEIR

02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:04.096
BOSSES THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE THAT

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:05.064
AND THAT'S A GREAT ASSURANCE FOR

02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:07.066
US TO HAVE. THE OTHER PIECE THAT

02:00:07.133 --> 02:00:08.834
I WOULD MENTION TO YOU IS THAT

02:00:08.901 --> 02:00:10.503
THERE'S GOING TO BE METRICS AND

02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:12.204
WE WELCOME THOSE METRICS BECAUSE

02:00:12.271 --> 02:00:12.972
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US WE WANT TO

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:15.174
BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU. THE VALUE

02:00:15.241 --> 02:00:16.842
THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE BRINGING

02:00:16.909 --> 02:00:18.511
BECAUSE WE WANT TO COME BACK TO

02:00:18.578 --> 02:00:20.079
THE TABLE AND SAY LOOK WHAT WHAT

02:00:20.146 --> 02:00:21.881
WE CAN DO. AND HOW MUCH MORE WE

02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:23.316
CAN. AND SO WHAT WE HAVEN'T

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:25.151
FLESHED OUT EXACTLY WHAT THOSE

02:00:25.217 --> 02:00:26.118
METRICS ARE GOING TO BE I CAN'T

02:00:26.185 --> 02:00:27.119
IMAGINE IT BEING SOMEWHERE

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:29.088
AROUND LIKE WHAT. WHAT STAFF DID

02:00:29.155 --> 02:00:31.390
YOU HIRE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WHAT

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.225
PROGRAMS THAT BE FOCUSED ON AND

02:00:33.292 --> 02:00:33.993
I THINK WITH THOSE METRICS

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:34.961
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE GROWTH

02:00:35.027 --> 02:00:36.162
VERSUS SHRINKAGE. WHO WAS HOPING

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:38.598
TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR COMMENT

02:00:38.664 --> 02:00:39.198
REGARDING THE ELIMINATION OF.

02:00:39.265 --> 02:00:40.132
COST BARRIERS. CAN YOU HELP US

02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:41.767
TO QUANTIFY AND- DIRECT WHERE

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:43.736
THOSE. ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT.

02:00:43.803 --> 02:00:46.238
THEY ARE HINDERING OUR ABILITY

02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:48.040
TO. RECRUIT AND- RETAIN

02:00:48.107 --> 02:00:49.308
QUALIFIED PUBLIC HEALTH

02:00:49.375 --> 02:00:50.309
INDIVIDUALS. YEAH THERE'S-

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:52.211
THERE'S SEVERAL SO THE FOR THE

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:53.245
FIRST AND MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS

02:00:53.312 --> 02:00:54.847
AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES. SO

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:55.881
IN ORDER TO GET YOUR PUBLIC

02:00:55.948 --> 02:00:57.183
HEALTH NURSE CERTIFICATION

02:00:57.249 --> 02:00:58.117
YOU'RE ALREADY A REGISTERED

02:00:58.184 --> 02:01:00.152
NURSE AND THEN YOU GO ABOVE AND

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:01.354
BEYOND AND GET AN ADDITIONAL

02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:01.787
CERTIFICATION. THAT

02:01:01.854 --> 02:01:03.022
CERTIFICATION COSTS ABOUT THREE

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:04.290
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. AND

02:01:04.357 --> 02:01:05.791
THEN YOU HAVE TO RECERTIFY EVERY

02:01:05.858 --> 02:01:08.060
TWO YEARS. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:08.961
ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY.

02:01:09.028 --> 02:01:11.330
AND WHILE THAT AMOUNT ON ITS OWN

02:01:11.397 --> 02:01:12.164
MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT. OF

02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:13.766
PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ARE NOT

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:15.134
GETTING PAID AS MUCH AS THEIR-

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:16.535
THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE

02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:17.203
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. AND SO THEY'RE

02:01:17.269 --> 02:01:17.970
THEY'RE ASKING. THEY'RE

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:19.839
BASICALLY PUTTING OUT MORE

02:01:19.905 --> 02:01:21.273
MONEY- TO WORK. AT IN THE HEALTH

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.208
DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S A

02:01:22.274 --> 02:01:24.710
CHALLENGE FOR THEM. BEFORE

02:01:24.777 --> 02:01:26.979
BEFORE THESE- CERTIFICATION FEES

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:29.248
WERE. AT HIGHER. YOU WOULD HAVE

02:01:29.315 --> 02:01:31.017
MORE INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:31.851
WOULD JUST GET THEIR PUBLIC

02:01:31.917 --> 02:01:32.985
HEALTH OUR CERTIFICATION. JUST

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:34.420
IN CASE THEY WERE INTERESTED IN

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:35.888
MAKING A CAREER CHANGE OR JUST

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:37.923
SO THAT THEY HAVE THAT BACK. THE

02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.758
BACKGROUND AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:01:38.824 --> 02:01:40.026
WE DON'T SEE THAT AS MUCH

02:01:40.092 --> 02:01:41.794
ANYMORE AND SO THAT'S A HUGE

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:43.129
ISSUE. I THINK THE OTHER THING

02:01:43.195 --> 02:01:45.431
IS ON A FEW OF THE TRAINING

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:46.832
PROGRAMS THAT I MENTIONED THAT

02:01:46.899 --> 02:01:49.368
MICROBIOLOGISTS. EPIDEMIOLOGISTS

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:51.404
AND- EXCUSE ME LET ME JUST WENT

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:53.039
DOWN A QUICK PUBLIC LAB. THESE

02:01:53.105 --> 02:01:55.274
PROGRAMS ARE IN EXISTENCE TODAY

02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:57.009
THEY'RE ON A SMALL SCALE AND THE

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:58.310
REASON WHY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

02:01:58.377 --> 02:02:00.046
RAMPED UP IS THAT LOCAL HEALTH

02:02:00.112 --> 02:02:01.847
DEPARTMENTS HAVE TO PUT UP.

02:02:01.914 --> 02:02:02.848
EITHER FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO.

02:02:02.915 --> 02:02:03.883
OFFER TRAINING SLAUGHTER

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:05.151
FELLOWSHIP FLAG OR THE

02:02:05.217 --> 02:02:07.520
DEPARTMENT HAS HAD A LITTLE

02:02:07.586 --> 02:02:08.187
LIMITED BUDGET. AND SO SOME OF

02:02:08.254 --> 02:02:09.155
THESE COST BARRIERS THINKING

02:02:09.221 --> 02:02:10.423
ABOUT A HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHO

02:02:10.489 --> 02:02:12.024

DOLLARS TOGETHER. YOU SEE A LOT

02:02:15.127 --> 02:02:16.062
OF THAT THE TRAINEES ARE THE

02:02:16.128 --> 02:02:17.163
&lt;c.cyan&gt;OLLOWS THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS&lt;/c&gt;

02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:18.230
LANDING AND IN LARGER

02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:19.598
JURISDICTIONS AT TIMES BECAUSE

02:02:19.665 --> 02:02:21.467
THEY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:22.268
RESOURCES. AND SO IT'S NOT

02:02:22.334 --> 02:02:24.103
EQUITABLE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.438
WANTED TO HAVE STATE

02:02:25.504 --> 02:02:26.005
INVESTMENTS. WERE YOU COULD

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:27.339
TRAIN AND GROW THE COHORTS AT

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:29.075

THAT WE HAVE SOME STATEWIDE. BUT

02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:33.239
SOME LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND WHAT

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:38.210
THEY DETERMINE. IS MOST NEED IN

02:03:38.277 --> 02:03:38.944

02:07:05.117 --> 02:07:07.019
THAT I WOULD JUST ADD THOUGH IS

02:07:07.086 --> 02:07:08.620
THAT. AT BECAUSE OF FUNDING-

02:07:08.687 --> 02:07:10.422
INADEQUATE FUNDING AND AS IN THE

02:07:10.489 --> 02:07:12.191

OVER THE PAST DECADE AND SO ONE

02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:18.864
OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:20.966
REALLY KNOW YET IS WHAT IS THE

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:23.335
PROPER NUMBER. OF LABS TO HAVE

02:07:23.402 --> 02:07:24.837
IN OUR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LABS

02:07:24.903 --> 02:07:25.871
WHO ARE UNIQUE FROM OTHER

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:27.006
LABORATORIES IN OUR IN OUR

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:29.241
STATE. AND SO ONE THING THAT WE

02:07:29.308 --> 02:07:30.843
WOULD JUST AFTER THAT IN THESE

02:07:30.909 --> 02:07:31.777
WORKING GROUPS AND THESE

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:33.412
DISCUSSIONS THAT THERE REALLY BE

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:34.880
A STUDY A STRONG STUDY OF. WHAT

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:36.448
SHOULD OUR CAPACITY BE IT IS IT

02:07:36.515 --> 02:07:37.850
PER POPULATION IS AT HER LIKE

02:07:37.916 --> 02:07:39.651
SIZE AND REGION. I KNOW CAREER

02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:40.853
SERVICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT

AMENABLE TO A NEEDS ASSESSMENT

02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:50.863
TO ANALYZE THE LAB NETWORK FOR

02:07:50.929 --> 02:07:54.266
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YES WE

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:56.702
DID YEARS OUR NATIONAL- BUT HELP

02:07:56.769 --> 02:07:58.871

LOOK AT OUR CENTRALIZED LAB OUR

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:02.374
STATE LAB AND THEY DID DO AN

02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:03.842
ASSESSMENT MADE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:05.711

IT'S ON PAGE TWENTY EIGHT OF THE

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:16.288
AGENDA YOU STATE THAT YOU WILL

02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:17.523
BE ESTABLISHING APPROXIMATELY A

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:18.157
THOUSAND PUBLIC HEALTH

02:08:18.223 --> 02:08:19.525
VLUNTEERS WHO ARE TRAINED

02:08:19.591 --> 02:08:22.327
CENTRALLY WHERE IS THAT CENTRAL

02:08:22.394 --> 02:08:24.430
LOCATION WHERE YOU WILL BE

02:08:24.496 --> 02:08:26.265
TRAINING THEM HAVE WE

02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:27.800
ESTABLISHED THAT TRAINING

02:08:27.866 --> 02:08:32.037
PROGRAM CAN YOU ELABORATE A

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:33.272
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THIS PUBLIC

02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:34.907
HEALTH COR. THERE WERE SO IT'S

02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:36.508
VERY MUCH LIKE OUR COCONUT

02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:37.509
PROGRAM IN FACT THE PEOPLE

02:08:37.576 --> 02:08:39.311
MANAGING IT ARE THE SAME PEOPLE

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:41.146
WHO MANAGED OUR CAL CONNECT. OUT

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:43.115
WHERE WE TRAINED OVER TEN

02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:45.184
THOUSAND CAL- CONTACT TRACERS

02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:47.019

02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:42.928
CDPH HAD INFECTIOUS DISEASE

02:16:42.994 --> 02:16:44.462
INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT WERE

02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:45.697
SUFFICIENT FOR ROUTINE

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:47.866
ACTIVITIES. BUT WE'RE LIMITED IN

02:16:47.933 --> 02:16:49.167
FUNCTIONALITY DUE TO LIMITED

02:16:49.234 --> 02:16:51.503
RESOURCES AND THE SYSTEMS WERE

02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:53.171
NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE PANDEMIC

02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:55.574

RECEIVING LABORATORY DATA. AND

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:23.468
IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES

02:17:23.535 --> 02:17:25.303
TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE ANALYZE

02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:28.173
AND REPORT LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA

02:17:28.239 --> 02:17:30.775
QUICKLY AND CONSISTENTLY. WE DID

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:32.544
NOT HAVE FLEXIBLE TOOLS TO

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:34.579

WE HEARD ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE

02:22:24.002 --> 02:22:27.105
OVER ARCHING IT STRATEGY AND-

02:22:27.171 --> 02:22:28.239
THE DIRECTION THAT THE

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:29.941
ADMINISTRATION IS GOING IS TO

02:22:30.008 --> 02:22:33.678
HIRE A CHIEF. HI T. STRATEGIST.

02:38:50.387 --> 02:38:51.955
DOES ADDRESS A CURRENT GAP IN

02:38:52.022 --> 02:38:53.490
THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO CLIMATE

02:38:53.557 --> 02:38:55.859
CHANGE RELATED HEALTH EVENTS AND

02:38:55.926 --> 02:38:59.062
HAS A NUMBER OF MERITS- AS-

02:38:59.129 --> 02:39:00.264
WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE HEALTH

02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:01.965
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL

02:39:02.032 --> 02:39:03.467
CONTINUE TO GROW PARTICULARLY AS

02:39:03.533 --> 02:39:04.701
THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF

02:39:04.768 --> 02:39:07.471
CLIMATE RELATED EVENTS. INCREASE

02:39:07.537 --> 02:39:09.673
SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HELP THE

02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:11.708
STATE- PROVIDE REAL TIME

02:39:11.775 --> 02:39:14.311
ANALYTICS AS DR RADHA KRISHNA-

02:39:14.378 --> 02:39:16.580
DETAILED ALLOWS FOR THE EARLY

02:39:16.647 --> 02:39:18.715
DETECTION OF OUTBREAKS IT WILL

02:39:18.782 --> 02:39:21.151
ALSO INCREASE THE AND ARE THE

02:39:21.218 --> 02:39:22.619
STATE'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:39:22.686 --> 02:39:24.521
MAGNITUDE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE

02:39:24.588 --> 02:39:26.156
MAGNITUDE OF VARIOUS HEALTH

02:39:26.223 --> 02:39:27.724
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE RELATED

02:39:27.791 --> 02:39:29.326
EVENTS AND HOW THESE IMPACTS

02:39:29.393 --> 02:39:31.795
AFFECT DIFFERENT GROUPS- AS WELL

02:39:31.862 --> 02:39:33.764
AS DIFFERENT REGIONS. AND THE

02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:35.098
VARIOUS DATA COLLECTED COULD

02:39:35.165 --> 02:39:36.500
FACILITATE ANALYSIS AND

02:39:36.566 --> 02:39:38.201
EVALUATION OF THE POTENTIAL

02:39:38.268 --> 02:39:39.569
EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS

02:39:39.636 --> 02:39:41.872
INTERVENTIONS TAKEN TO REDUCE

02:39:41.939 --> 02:39:45.042
THE HEALTH IMPACTS. I'M ONE OF

02:39:45.108 --> 02:39:46.576
THE THINGS THAT APARTMENT ALSO-

02:39:46.643 --> 02:39:48.145
NOTED TO OUR OFFICE IS THAT

02:39:48.211 --> 02:39:50.681
PARTICIPATION IN THE BIO SINCE

02:39:50.747 --> 02:39:52.215
PLATFORM- ENABLES CALIFORNIA TO

02:39:52.282 --> 02:39:54.117
PARTICIPATE IN A COMMUNITY OF

02:39:54.184 --> 02:39:55.419
PRACTICE WITH OTHER STATES AND

02:39:55.485 --> 02:39:57.154
ALSO ENGAGE LOCAL HEALTH

02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:58.288
JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE

02:39:58.355 --> 02:40:01.258
LEVEL- COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE.

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:03.327
AND AS DR RADHAKRISHNA ALSO

02:40:03.393 --> 02:40:04.928
NOTED CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE

02:40:04.995 --> 02:40:06.863
ONLY STATES THAT'S NOT ACTIVELY

02:40:06.930 --> 02:40:08.465
ENGAGED RIGHT NOW. SO THE ONE

02:40:08.532 --> 02:40:10.600
ISSUE THAT WE WOULD RAISE THAT'S

02:40:10.667 --> 02:40:11.134
NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT THE

02:40:11.201 --> 02:40:12.803
DETAILS OF THIS PARTICULAR

02:40:12.869 --> 02:40:15.138
PROPOSAL- IS JUST TO NOTE THAT

02:40:15.205 --> 02:40:16.773
WHILE THIS TYPE OF SURVEILLANCE

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:18.942
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DETECT

02:40:19.009 --> 02:40:20.777
ISSUES AND OUTBREAKS EARLY AND

02:40:20.844 --> 02:40:22.779
TO DO REAL TIME ANALYSIS. IT

02:40:22.846 --> 02:40:24.147
DOESN'T NECESSARILY DETERMINE

02:40:24.214 --> 02:40:27.417
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SO- BEYOND IS

02:40:27.484 --> 02:40:29.453
SORT OF BEYOND THE NOTIFICATION

02:40:29.519 --> 02:40:30.887
SO FOR EXAMPLE HOW WILL THE

02:40:30.954 --> 02:40:32.923
STATE USE THIS INFORMATION IN

02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:34.591
REAL TIME TO ACTIVATE A RESPONSE

02:40:34.658 --> 02:40:36.626
BY RELEVANT STATE AND LOCAL

02:40:36.693 --> 02:40:39.963
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES- AND- OUR

02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:41.598
OFFICE DOES THINK THIS IS WHAT

02:40:41.665 --> 02:40:43.300
ALSO MAKES- THE DEPARTMENT

02:40:43.367 --> 02:40:44.634
SECOND PROPOSAL AND REGIONAL.

02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:46.837
REGIONAL CLIMATE PLANNING

02:40:46.903 --> 02:40:49.006
IMPORTANT. THANK YOU WITH

02:40:49.072 --> 02:40:51.608
THAT'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS

02:40:51.675 --> 02:40:53.343
REMEMBER QUESTIONS I'LL KEEP IT

02:40:53.410 --> 02:40:54.811
HERE AS CHAIR. OF MY FIRST

02:40:54.878 --> 02:40:56.747
QUESTIONS GOING TO BE FOR DR

02:40:56.813 --> 02:40:59.983
RADHA KRISHNA- REGARDING BIO

02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:02.519
SENSE I I'D LIKE TO GET A SENSE

02:41:02.586 --> 02:41:04.588
WHETHER OR NOT THE FEES. HAVE

02:41:04.654 --> 02:41:06.723
BEEN A BARRIER FOR HOSPITAL

02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:09.693
PARTICIPATION FIRST AND THEN

02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:13.163
SECOND- THE FUNDING SEEMS TO BE

02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:16.033
ONE TIME- IS THERE A NEED FOR ON

02:41:16.099 --> 02:41:18.368
GOING FUNDING TO ENSURE. AND

02:41:18.435 --> 02:41:21.004
ENCOURAGE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN

02:41:21.071 --> 02:41:24.074
BIOSCIENCE. YEAH THANK YOU FOR

02:41:24.141 --> 02:41:25.675
THE QUESTION AND ALL DEFERRED

02:41:25.742 --> 02:41:27.177
LINDA HELEN'S TO GIVE A LITTLE

02:41:27.244 --> 02:41:28.945
MORE DETAIL BUT START BIKE

02:41:29.012 --> 02:41:32.082
SHARING- FROM OUR REVIEW AND

02:41:32.149 --> 02:41:34.418
ENGAGEMENT OF FACILITIES AS WELL

02:41:34.484 --> 02:41:36.253
AS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS

02:41:36.319 --> 02:41:37.187
WELL AS INTERACTING WITH THE

02:41:37.254 --> 02:41:38.955
CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND

02:41:39.022 --> 02:41:41.491
LEARNING FROM OTHER STATES- WE

02:41:41.558 --> 02:41:43.760
DON'T VIEW THE FEES TO BE. A

02:41:43.827 --> 02:41:46.530
MAJOR BARRIER CERTAINLY BEING

02:41:46.596 --> 02:41:48.265
ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM FOR SMALLER

02:41:48.331 --> 02:41:50.200
FACILITIES AN ONBOARDING WOULD

02:41:50.267 --> 02:41:52.369
BE OF BENEFIT AND THAT'S WHY WE

02:41:52.436 --> 02:41:54.337
OUTWEIGH A MODEST AMOUNT OF

02:41:54.404 --> 02:41:56.339
FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT

02:41:56.406 --> 02:41:57.407
BUT REALLY SETTING THE

02:41:57.474 --> 02:41:59.876
EXPECTATION. THE ONGOING

02:41:59.943 --> 02:42:02.879
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND- VERY

02:42:02.946 --> 02:42:07.217
HANDS ON- I. T. SUPPORT IS THE

02:42:07.284 --> 02:42:09.086
MAIN ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:42:09.152 --> 02:42:10.720
ADDRESS AND I'LL JUST CLARIFY

02:42:10.787 --> 02:42:12.589
WE'RE STILL ON ISSUE NUMBER NINE

02:42:12.656 --> 02:42:14.558
WHICH IS ONGOING IT'S NOT ONE

02:42:14.624 --> 02:42:16.827
TIME- SO IT WOULD ALLOW OUR

02:42:16.893 --> 02:42:19.296
STAFF TO BE ABLE TO. ON BOARD

02:42:19.362 --> 02:42:20.997
FACILITIES ON A ROLLING BASIS

02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:23.900
AND WE WOULD START WITH FORTY

02:42:23.967 --> 02:42:25.502
FIVE EMERGENCY ROOM FACILITIES

02:42:25.569 --> 02:42:27.771
THAT ALREADY USE THE PLATFORM

02:42:27.838 --> 02:42:29.406
BUT NOT FOR CLIMATE SPECIFIC

02:42:29.473 --> 02:42:31.875
CONDITIONS- TO GET THEM THAT

02:42:31.942 --> 02:42:33.877
THAT HANDS ON TA AND THEN TO

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:35.412
CONTINUE THE ROLLOUT FROM THERE.

02:42:35.479 --> 02:42:38.949
HAPPY TO HAVE LINDA ANSWER

02:42:39.015 --> 02:42:40.750
ANYMORE QUESTIONS THERE. THANKS

02:42:40.817 --> 02:42:43.120
I WILL JUST ADD THAT- WE HAVE

02:42:43.186 --> 02:42:44.387
BEEN CALLING EMERGENCY

02:42:44.454 --> 02:42:45.455
DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL HEALTH

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:46.823
DEPARTMENTS TO TRY TO FIND OUT

02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:48.692
MORE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES SO

02:42:48.758 --> 02:42:51.862
FAR- PARTICIPATING IF THEY DO OR

02:42:51.928 --> 02:42:54.798
WHY THEY HAVE NOT AND- SO FAR WE

02:42:54.865 --> 02:42:56.166
HAVE NOT GOTTEN A SPENT THE

02:42:56.233 --> 02:42:57.334
DEFINITIVE NUMBER FROM THEM.

02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:59.035
ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO PAY

02:42:59.102 --> 02:43:01.238
OR IF THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR

02:43:01.304 --> 02:43:02.472
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD VENDORS

02:43:02.539 --> 02:43:04.007
SO IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO VARY

02:43:04.074 --> 02:43:05.509
ACCORDING TO THE ELECTRONIC

02:43:05.575 --> 02:43:08.278
HEALTH RECORD VENDOR. WHETHER OR

02:43:08.345 --> 02:43:10.247
HOW MUCH THE SECURITY NEEDS TO

02:43:10.313 --> 02:43:11.781
PAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CENTER

02:43:11.848 --> 02:43:13.717
OF THAT SURVEILLANCE MODUL- SO

02:43:13.783 --> 02:43:15.318
WE'RE FINDING THAT THAT DOES NOT

02:43:15.385 --> 02:43:17.254
SEEM TO BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:19.556
TO PARTICIPATION. AND 71% OF

02:43:19.623 --> 02:43:20.957
FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:43:21.024 --> 02:43:24.161
YOU HAVE TO PAY- SO WE EXPECTED

02:43:24.227 --> 02:43:25.228
ONCE WE GET THE SYSTEM UP AND

02:43:25.295 --> 02:43:28.832
RUNNING THAT- BE- INCENTIVES

02:43:28.899 --> 02:43:30.467
INVOLVED IN WHAT WAS CALLED

02:43:30.534 --> 02:43:32.235
MEANINGFUL USE KNOWLEDGE NOW I'M

02:43:32.302 --> 02:43:33.970
DATA INTERPRET BILITY THROUGH

02:43:34.037 --> 02:43:36.573
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WILL BE

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:38.208
SUFFICIENT INCENTIVE FOR MOST

02:43:38.275 --> 02:43:39.109
FACILITIES TO WANT TO

02:43:39.176 --> 02:43:41.378
PARTICIPATE AND HAVE THAT DATA

02:43:41.444 --> 02:43:46.850
FOR THEMSELVES. AND THEIR

02:43:46.917 --> 02:43:49.052
COMMUNITY IN THEIR OWN TIME. IT

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:50.954
WOULD WITH AN- TEN UNDER. TO FOR

02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:53.223
FOUR ON THE UP. AGENDA IF I CAN

02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:55.392
. IN IT YOU MENTION THAT CDPH

02:43:55.458 --> 02:43:56.993
WILL USE SOME OF THE RESULTS TO

02:43:57.060 --> 02:43:59.095
DEVELOP PROTECT PREDICTIVE

02:43:59.162 --> 02:44:01.164
ANALYTIC MODELS OF FUTURE

02:44:01.231 --> 02:44:04.000
INCIDENTS OF CONDITIONS SUCH AS

02:44:04.067 --> 02:44:05.235
HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES AND

02:44:05.302 --> 02:44:06.903
DEATHS I WAS HOPING YOU COULD

02:44:06.970 --> 02:44:08.572
TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

02:44:08.638 --> 02:44:11.274
THIS AND THEN AS THE L. A. O.

02:44:11.341 --> 02:44:13.443
WAS REFERENCING HOW WE CAN HOPE

02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:15.212
TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE THIS

02:44:15.278 --> 02:44:17.847
WITH THE PUBLIC TO NOTIFY THEM.

02:44:17.914 --> 02:44:20.250
OF LET'S SAY EITHER POOR AIR

02:44:20.317 --> 02:44:22.452
QUALITY OR OF EXTREME HEAT

02:44:22.519 --> 02:44:24.955
CONDITIONS HOW ARE WE GOING TO

02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:26.656
BE ABLE TO ACTUALIZE THIS

02:44:26.723 --> 02:44:30.193
IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU FOR THE

02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:33.029
QUESTION- AND BEING FROM PUBLIC

02:44:33.096 --> 02:44:34.431
HEALTH THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO

02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:37.167
PREVENT- NOT JUST ACCOUNT-

02:44:37.234 --> 02:44:38.702
SUFFERING OR ILLNESS OR DISEASE

02:44:38.768 --> 02:44:40.470
OR INJURY IN THE MOMENT SO IT'S

02:44:40.537 --> 02:44:42.439
A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. I'M

02:44:42.505 --> 02:44:44.674
I'LL GIVE ONE EXAMPLE THAT COULD

02:44:44.741 --> 02:44:46.509
PERHAPS BRING TO LIGHT HOW THIS

02:44:46.576 --> 02:44:48.211
TYPE OF INFORMATION COULD BE

02:44:48.278 --> 02:44:49.346
USED IN ADDRESS SOME CURRENT

02:44:49.412 --> 02:44:52.015
SHORTCOMINGS. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T

02:44:52.082 --> 02:44:54.217
HAVE GOOD ANNUAL VISIBILITY LET

02:44:54.284 --> 02:44:57.187
ALONE REAL TIME VISIBILITY INTO

02:44:57.254 --> 02:44:59.256
THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS OF

02:44:59.322 --> 02:45:00.357
CLIMATE CONDITIONS AND IF WE

02:45:00.423 --> 02:45:02.759
JUST TAKE EXTREME HEAT. AS AN

02:45:02.826 --> 02:45:06.630
EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WHEN A HEAT

02:45:06.696 --> 02:45:10.033
WARNING IS ISSUED IT'S BASED ON.

02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:12.502
OUR AVERAGE TEMPERATURES WHICH

02:45:12.569 --> 02:45:13.970
DON'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE TO

02:45:14.037 --> 02:45:16.773
THE IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH- AND

02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:19.576
SO AS WE'RE ABLE TO GET DATA OUT

02:45:19.643 --> 02:45:22.178
FOR WHAT PARTICULAR THRESHOLDS

02:45:22.245 --> 02:45:24.581
ARE IMPACT HUMAN HEALTH FROM

02:45:24.648 --> 02:45:26.483
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ENCOUNTERS

02:45:26.549 --> 02:45:28.351
WERE ABLE BETTER TO BUILD OUR

02:45:28.418 --> 02:45:30.620
MODELS. TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO

02:45:30.687 --> 02:45:33.123
HUMAN HEALTH SPECIFICALLY SO FOR

02:45:33.189 --> 02:45:34.224
EXAMPLE WE COULD WORK WITH THE

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:36.726
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TO HAVE

02:45:36.793 --> 02:45:38.695
WARNINGS AND NOTIFICATIONS BE

02:45:38.762 --> 02:45:40.964
MORE ROOTED IN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE

02:45:41.031 --> 02:45:43.099
OF CALIFORNIANS BEING SENSITIVE

02:45:43.166 --> 02:45:45.101
TO CLIMATE CHANGES RATHER THAN

02:45:45.168 --> 02:45:46.970
JUST THE GENERIC- TEMPERATURE

02:45:47.037 --> 02:45:49.706
AVERAGE- AS I DID BRIEFLY

02:45:49.773 --> 02:45:51.308
MENTION WE DO HAVE ONE OF THE

02:45:51.374 --> 02:45:53.543
POSITIONS. DEDICATED FOR A

02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:55.578
COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST NOTING

02:45:55.645 --> 02:45:56.780
THAT CERTAINLY IN THE FUTURE

02:45:56.846 --> 02:45:58.548
PUBLIC HEALTH WE'RE BUILDING OUT

02:45:58.615 --> 02:45:59.883
A COMMUNICATIONS TEAM MORE

02:45:59.949 --> 02:46:02.652
BROADLY. GIVEN THAT THIS IS THE

02:46:02.719 --> 02:46:03.420
GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS

02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:05.155
OF THE CENTURY HAVING A

PUBLIC HEALTH- SO. WE RAISE THIS

02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:21.891
ISSUE JUST TO SAY THAT WE WOULD

02:53:21.958 --> 02:53:23.993

WHICH APPEARS. IN OUR APPEARS

02:53:33.736 --> 02:53:35.972
THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS

02:53:36.038 --> 02:53:38.741
TRYING TO DO THAT- ON THIS

02:53:38.808 --> 02:53:41.277
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE THINK IT

02:53:41.344 --> 02:53:42.779
DOES HAVE MERITS WERE AWARE THAT

02:53:42.845 --> 02:53:44.380
MANY LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS

02:53:44.447 --> 02:53:45.681
DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE STAFF FOR

02:53:45.748 --> 02:53:48.217
EXPERTISE TO CONDUCT PLANNING

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:50.286
RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M

02:53:50.353 --> 02:53:52.288
HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF

02:53:52.355 --> 02:53:53.856
CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD RAISE

02:53:53.923 --> 02:53:56.325
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH

02:53:56.392 --> 02:53:59.262
TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT-

02:53:59.328 --> 02:54:01.731
SO FIRSTOF ALL- AT RIGHT AT THE

02:54:01.798 --> 02:54:03.132
END THEIR DOCTOR WROTE A

02:54:03.199 --> 02:54:04.200
CHRISTIAN I MENTIONED THE FACT

02:54:04.267 --> 02:54:06.869
THAT THESE PLANS ARE AT THE

02:54:06.936 --> 02:54:08.404
REGIONAL LEVEL AND DON'T GO TO

02:54:08.471 --> 02:54:10.439
EVERY LOCAL HOLD JURISDICTION

02:54:10.506 --> 02:54:12.108
BUT AT LEAST IT'S A GOOD START.

02:54:12.175 --> 02:54:14.343
OUR CONCERN- WITH THIS EVEN

02:54:14.410 --> 02:54:15.411
THOUGH CLIMATE CHANGE IS

02:54:15.478 --> 02:54:18.648
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T- RESPECT

02:54:18.714 --> 02:54:20.850
LOCAL JURISDICTION BOUNDARIES-

02:54:20.917 --> 02:54:23.186
ARE CONCERNED REALLY IS- WHETHER

02:54:23.252 --> 02:54:24.854
THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS

02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:26.889
THAT DON'T RECEIVE THE FUNDING.

02:54:26.956 --> 02:54:28.758
WILL BE FULLY ENGAGED IN THE

02:54:28.825 --> 02:54:30.092
REGIONAL PLAN ESPECIALLY IF THEY

02:54:30.159 --> 02:54:31.394
DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE

02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:32.862
CAPACITY AND THEN DON'T GET THE

02:54:32.929 --> 02:54:34.597
FUNDING THROUGH THIS GRANT

02:54:34.664 --> 02:54:38.167

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT-

02:54:49.412 --> 02:54:50.279
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:54:50.346 --> 02:54:51.848
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD HAVE TO

02:54:51.914 --> 02:54:53.282
DESIGN ACTIVITIES THAT COULD BE

02:54:53.349 --> 02:54:55.084
CONDUCTED WITH EXISTING

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:57.453
RESOURCES- HOWEVER THAT

02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:00.356
OBVIOUSLY LIMITS THE EXTENT. OF

02:55:00.423 --> 02:55:01.557
WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AND

02:55:01.624 --> 02:55:02.525

CHECK THAT THE PROACTIVE. AND

03:21:41.255 --> 03:21:42.690

03:24:23.117 --> 03:24:25.119
PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES FUNDAMENTAL

03:24:25.186 --> 03:24:26.988
TO THE TO THE SOLUTION TO THAT

03:24:27.054 --> 03:24:29.223
I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THOUGH

03:24:29.290 --> 03:24:33.661

NATIONALLY 8% OF ELEMENTARY

03:24:41.369 --> 03:24:43.337
SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE COUNTRY

03:24:43.404 --> 03:24:45.539
DON'T HAVE A P. E. TEACHER IN

03:24:45.606 --> 03:24:51.512
CALIFORNIA IT'S 50% EVEN MORE

03:24:51.579 --> 03:24:53.648
EVEN FEWER LATINO AND AFRICAN

03:24:53.714 --> 03:24:58.552
AMERICAN KID SO IT IT IT'S A

COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. OKAY THE

03:25:07.895 --> 03:25:09.330
ONLY QUESTION I HAVE THAN FOR

03:25:09.397 --> 03:25:12.299
THE PANEL IS WHETHER OR NOT-

03:25:12.366 --> 03:25:13.768
THIS PROPOSED PUBLIC AWARENESS

03:25:13.834 --> 03:25:16.070
CAMPAIGN IS DUPLICATIVE OF SOME

03:25:16.137 --> 03:25:17.672
OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING

03:25:17.738 --> 03:25:20.708
WITHIN ALL CHILDREN. THE ACES

03:25:20.775 --> 03:25:22.309
EXCUSE ME THE ACES AWARE

03:25:22.376 --> 03:25:24.478

EXERCISE. IS IT DUPLICATIVE IS A

03:25:32.086 --> 03:25:33.688
SEPARATE HOUSING I THINK I'M

WORK IS MUCH BROADER THIS IS

03:25:41.629 --> 03:25:44.265
MUCH MORE SPECIFIC JUST TO THE

03:25:44.331 --> 03:25:46.767
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SAIVA. DR

03:25:46.834 --> 03:25:50.104
THOMAS. DOCTOROW MOST. SO THERE

03:25:50.171 --> 03:25:52.239
BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE'RE

ALL HAVE WORK ON BE IN WITHIN

03:40:53.974 --> 03:40:57.477
CALIFORNIA- WE OBSERVE PIANOS

03:40:57.544 --> 03:40:58.878
PROGRAM WERE APPROACHED BY

03:40:58.945 --> 03:41:00.847
SEVERAL LABORATORIES OPERATING

03:41:00.914 --> 03:41:03.984
CONDUCTED. YES NAY SERVICES

03:41:04.050 --> 03:41:06.453
WITHIN CALIFORNIA SO THERE WAS

03:41:06.519 --> 03:41:09.055
NO INDICATION. PROCUREMENTS OR

03:41:13.860 --> 03:41:17.330
SUPPORT- IF IN A IN THE THROUGH

03:41:17.397 --> 03:41:19.399
THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENTS REMAIN

03:41:19.466 --> 03:41:20.934
WITHIN THE STATE. THERE'S ALSO A

03:41:21.001 --> 03:41:22.669
RISK BOB THAT SUPPOSED JUSTICE

03:41:22.736 --> 03:41:25.038

INCREASE TURNAROUND TIMES

03:41:27.374 --> 03:41:29.409
IMPROPER. I'M FOR STATE

03:41:29.476 --> 03:41:31.211
CONTRACTING ROLES ARE ARE THAT

THINK IT'S STAKEHOLDERS. I'M FIT

03:41:44.658 --> 03:41:46.793

LABORATORY ASSOCIATION OUR

03:43:14.080 --> 03:43:15.548
ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN HEARING

03:43:15.615 --> 03:43:17.517
CALIFORNIA FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS

03:43:17.584 --> 03:43:19.252
WE HAVE AS MEMBERS HOSPITAL

03:43:19.319 --> 03:43:21.488
BASED LABS LARGE COMMERCIAL LABS

03:43:21.554 --> 03:43:23.289
THAT COVER THE UNITED STATES.

03:43:23.356 --> 03:43:24.657

SPEAK ABOUT THE PRENATAL

03:43:30.029 --> 03:43:32.232
SCREENING PROGRAM AND WE DO HAVE

03:43:32.298 --> 03:43:33.800
SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE

03:43:33.867 --> 03:43:34.868
DEPARTMENT'S RECENT PROPOSED

03:43:34.934 --> 03:43:37.237
CHANGES TO HOW THE FETAL

03:43:37.303 --> 03:43:39.305
CHROMOSOME AVENEL ABNORMALITIES

03:43:39.372 --> 03:43:41.207
WILL BE SCREENED. THESE CHANGES

03:43:41.274 --> 03:43:42.976
WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT ACCESS TO

03:43:43.042 --> 03:43:44.811
TESTING FOR PREGNANT WOMEN IN

03:43:44.878 --> 03:43:47.647
CALIFORNIA. EFFECTIVE JULY ONE

03:43:47.714 --> 03:43:49.149
OF THIS YEAR THE PRENATAL

03:43:49.215 --> 03:43:50.650
SCREENING PROGRAM IS REPLACING

03:43:50.717 --> 03:43:52.418
ITS CURRENT TESTING WITH THE

03:43:52.485 --> 03:43:54.587
ADVANCED CELL FREE DNA BLOOD

03:43:54.654 --> 03:43:56.890
TESTING. THE DEPARTMENT DOES

03:43:56.956 --> 03:43:58.424
STATE THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE

03:43:58.491 --> 03:43:59.659
STATE SCREENING PROGRAM IS

03:43:59.726 --> 03:44:01.628
VOLUNTARY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN

03:44:01.694 --> 03:44:03.663
HOWEVER AFTER JULY FIRST

03:44:03.730 --> 03:44:04.998
PREGNANT WOMEN WILL NO LONGER

03:44:05.064 --> 03:44:06.065
HAVE ACCESS TO THIS MORE

03:44:06.132 --> 03:44:08.034
ADVANCED TESTING OUTSIDE OF THE

03:44:08.101 --> 03:44:10.804
PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT HAS

03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:12.305
DECLARED THAT IT WILL BE ILLEGAL

03:44:12.372 --> 03:44:14.641
FOR PREGNANT WOMEN TO GET THIS

03:44:14.707 --> 03:44:15.909
TESTING DONE AT A LABORATORY

03:44:15.975 --> 03:44:18.611
OUTSIDE. SO EVEN THOUGH IT IS

03:44:18.678 --> 03:44:19.946
TECHNICALLY VOLUNTARY. A

03:44:20.013 --> 03:44:21.281
PREGNANT WOMAN DOES NOT HAVE TO

03:44:21.347 --> 03:44:22.782
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM BUT

03:44:22.849 --> 03:44:24.317
IF THEY DON'T THEY CANNOT HAVE

03:44:24.384 --> 03:44:26.386
ACCESS TO THE CELL FREE DNA

03:44:26.452 --> 03:44:29.255
TESTING. I DO UNDERSTAND- THAT

03:44:29.322 --> 03:44:31.157
THEY HAVE SAID THAT IN THE PAST.

03:44:31.224 --> 03:44:32.792
THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITS ON THE

03:44:32.859 --> 03:44:34.260
TYPE OF TESTING THAT WAS OFFERED

03:44:34.327 --> 03:44:35.795
THROUGH THE PEANUTS PROGRAM

03:44:35.862 --> 03:44:38.464
HOWEVER THIS NEW TESTING IS A

03:44:38.531 --> 03:44:39.966
CURRENT KIND OF FAR BETTER

03:44:40.033 --> 03:44:41.768
APPROACH TO TESTING. AND WE DO

03:44:41.835 --> 03:44:43.570
THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO LIMIT THAT

03:44:43.636 --> 03:44:46.773
OUTSIDE OF THE PROGRAM. A

03:44:46.840 --> 03:44:47.974
PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THE

03:44:48.041 --> 03:44:49.175
RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHERE SHE HAS

03:44:49.242 --> 03:44:51.544
HER TESTING DONE FOR THIS NEW

03:44:51.611 --> 03:44:54.047
TYPE OF PROCEDURE. AND THE OTHER

03:44:54.113 --> 03:44:55.915
ISSUE IS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED

03:44:55.982 --> 03:44:57.517
THAT LABORATORIES ARE BEING

03:44:57.584 --> 03:44:59.752
PROHIBITED NOW IN THIS WAY.

03:44:59.819 --> 03:45:00.820
CALIFORNIA LABORATORIES HAVE

03:45:00.887 --> 03:45:02.488
BEEN PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF CELL

03:45:02.555 --> 03:45:05.291
FREE DNA TESTING FOR MANY YEARS

03:45:05.358 --> 03:45:06.359
AND HAVE PERFORMED MILLIONS OF

03:45:06.426 --> 03:45:08.328
THESE TESTS. THESE LABORATORIES

03:45:08.394 --> 03:45:10.129
HOLD VALID LICENCES ISSUED BY

03:45:10.196 --> 03:45:11.731
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

03:45:11.798 --> 03:45:12.832
ACCREDITATION BY THE UNITED

03:45:12.899 --> 03:45:14.100
STATES GOVERNMENT UNDER THE

03:45:14.167 --> 03:45:15.802
CALIFORNIA I'M SORRY UNDER THE

03:45:15.869 --> 03:45:17.270
CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT

03:45:17.337 --> 03:45:19.305
AMENDMENTS OR CLEA. AND

03:45:19.372 --> 03:45:20.773
ACCREDITATION BY THE COLLEGE OF

03:45:20.840 --> 03:45:23.042
AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS TO PERFORM

03:45:23.109 --> 03:45:26.045
CELL FREE DNA TESTING. AND IN

03:45:26.112 --> 03:45:27.480
FACT THE LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN

03:45:27.547 --> 03:45:29.215
OPERATING UNDER THESE LICENSES

03:45:29.282 --> 03:45:30.583
AND ACCREDITATIONS TO BE

03:45:30.650 --> 03:45:32.385
PERFORMING TESTING AND FOLLOW UP

03:45:32.452 --> 03:45:33.953
TEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S

03:45:34.020 --> 03:45:36.222
CURRENT PROGRAM CURRENT PRENATAL

03:45:36.289 --> 03:45:38.758
SCREENING PROGRAM. THIS NEW

03:45:38.825 --> 03:45:40.393
PROHIBITIN WILL RESTRICT OF

03:45:40.460 --> 03:45:42.195
THOSE SAME LABORATORIES HAVE

03:45:42.262 --> 03:45:42.996
BEEN PERFORMING THESE TESTS IN

03:45:43.062 --> 03:45:45.031
THE PAST. FROM BEING ABLE TO

03:45:45.098 --> 03:45:46.933
PROVIDE ACCESS TO THESE TESTS

03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:48.968
OUTSIDE OF THE NEW PROGRAM ONCE

03:45:49.035 --> 03:45:51.871
THE TRANSITION TAKES PLACE.

03:45:51.938 --> 03:45:52.972
ANOTHER CONCERN WITH THE

03:45:53.039 --> 03:45:54.841
PROPOSED TRANSITION IS THAT

03:45:54.908 --> 03:45:56.676
LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT

03:45:56.743 --> 03:45:59.612
EVEN THOUGH THEY DO WANT TO

03:45:59.679 --> 03:46:00.313
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THEY

03:46:00.380 --> 03:46:01.814
WOULD HAVE TO GUARANTEE THAT ALL

03:46:01.881 --> 03:46:03.383
THE TESTING WOULD BE DONE ONLY

03:46:03.449 --> 03:46:04.384
AT ONE OF THEIR LABORATORIES

03:46:04.450 --> 03:46:06.552
PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN THE STATE

03:46:06.619 --> 03:46:08.087
OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN IN I

03:46:08.154 --> 03:46:09.555
KNOW THERE WAS MENTIONED THAT

03:46:09.622 --> 03:46:10.957
THERE WAS- LABORATORIES WERE

03:46:11.024 --> 03:46:13.426
GIVEN THE OPTION. BUT WE DO KNOW

03:46:13.493 --> 03:46:14.794
OF SOME LABORATORIES THAT DID

03:46:14.861 --> 03:46:16.129
WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

03:46:16.195 --> 03:46:17.931
PROGRAM AND WE'RE TOLD THAT THEY

03:46:17.997 --> 03:46:19.399
COULD NOT. BECAUSE THEY COULD

03:46:19.465 --> 03:46:20.833
NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE TESTING

03:46:20.900 --> 03:46:22.235
WOULD BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA OUT

03:46:22.302 --> 03:46:24.404
THERE CALIFORNIA SITE. AND THE

03:46:24.470 --> 03:46:26.472
REASON THIS IS A CONCERN IS

03:46:26.539 --> 03:46:27.307
BECAUSE- A LOT OF CALIFORNIA

03:46:27.373 --> 03:46:28.641
LABORATORIES HAVE SPECIALTY

03:46:28.708 --> 03:46:30.176
LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

03:46:30.243 --> 03:46:32.378
STATES. AND THEY HAVE SPECIFIC

03:46:32.445 --> 03:46:33.880
TRAINING AND PERSONNEL FOR

03:46:33.947 --> 03:46:36.015
DIFFERENT TYPES OF TESTS. BY

03:46:36.082 --> 03:46:37.951
CONSOLIDATING THE SPECIALTY

03:46:38.017 --> 03:46:39.752
TESTING AT SOME OFTHEIR KEY

03:46:39.819 --> 03:46:40.753
LOCATIONS. THE PATIENTS REALLY

03:46:40.820 --> 03:46:43.690
DO GET THE BEST IN CLASS SERVICE

03:46:43.756 --> 03:46:44.691
AT THAT LOCATION. THERE IS NO

03:46:44.757 --> 03:46:46.459
BENEFIT TO THE PATIENT FOR THE

03:46:46.526 --> 03:46:48.361
DEPARTMENT TO RESTRICT WHERE THE

03:46:48.428 --> 03:46:49.996
TEST IS PHYSICALLY PROCESS.

03:46:50.063 --> 03:46:51.297
THERE WAS MENTION THAT THERE WAS

03:46:51.364 --> 03:46:52.732
CONCERN THAT THERE BE LOST

03:46:52.799 --> 03:46:55.335
SPECIMENS. OR INCREASE THE TURN

03:46:55.401 --> 03:46:57.437
AROUND TIME BUT REALLY- WE'VE

03:46:57.503 --> 03:46:59.272
BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE

03:46:59.339 --> 03:47:01.607
LABORATORY INDUSTRY. HAS REALLY

03:47:01.674 --> 03:47:05.111
DONE A GOOD JOB- IN REGARD TO

03:47:05.178 --> 03:47:07.480
ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND-

03:47:07.547 --> 03:47:08.214
THERE ARE VERY FEW SPECIMENS

03:47:08.281 --> 03:47:09.949
THAT ARE LOST. IN THE TURN

03:47:10.016 --> 03:47:11.751
AROUND TIME IS REALLY IMPROVED I

03:47:11.818 --> 03:47:13.786
MEAN AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ORDER

03:47:13.853 --> 03:47:15.421
SOMETHING ON. AMAZON YOU CAN

03:47:15.488 --> 03:47:17.357
PRETTY MUCH GET IT THE NEXT DAY

03:47:17.423 --> 03:47:18.057
EVEN IF IT'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

03:47:18.124 --> 03:47:19.859
AND ALL OF THOSE LOGISTICS THAT

03:47:19.926 --> 03:47:20.426
LABORATORIES HAVE DEVELOPED

03:47:20.493 --> 03:47:22.228
SPECIALLY DURING COVERT- TO

03:47:22.295 --> 03:47:24.097
EXPAND CAPACITY THEY REALLY.

03:47:24.163 --> 03:47:25.631
HAVE GOTTEN IT DOWN ON BEING

03:47:25.698 --> 03:47:28.334
ABLE TO PROCESS THESE SAMPLES

03:47:28.401 --> 03:47:31.137
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. AND THEN

03:47:31.204 --> 03:47:32.438
THERE ARE ALSO SOME ADDITIONAL

03:47:32.505 --> 03:47:33.506
CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED

03:47:33.573 --> 03:47:34.774
TRANSITION BUT WE WANTED TO

03:47:34.841 --> 03:47:36.642
HIGHLIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT

03:47:36.709 --> 03:47:37.744
ONES DURING THE LIMITED TIME WE

03:47:37.810 --> 03:47:39.245
HAVE TODAY. BUT THESE OTHER

03:47:39.312 --> 03:47:41.714
ISSUES DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

03:47:41.781 --> 03:47:42.782
BEFORE THIS PROGRAM TRANSITION

03:47:42.849 --> 03:47:44.717
TAKES PLACE. I AM I KNOW THERE'S

03:47:44.784 --> 03:47:47.387
BEEN MENTION OF SOME MEETINGS IN

03:47:47.453 --> 03:47:48.054
TWENTY NINETEEN BUT REALLY THOSE

03:47:48.121 --> 03:47:49.422
WERE A LOT MORE LIMITED AND

03:47:49.489 --> 03:47:50.890
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES

03:47:50.957 --> 03:47:53.659
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THEN

03:47:53.726 --> 03:47:54.794
A LOT MORE INFORMATION THAT HAS

03:47:54.861 --> 03:47:55.962
COME OUT. AND SO REALLY- THE

03:47:56.029 --> 03:47:57.196
ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN

03:47:57.263 --> 03:47:59.032
ENOUGH PUBLIC A COMMENTER PUBLIC

03:47:59.098 --> 03:48:01.200
INPUT. OF PHYSICIANS WHO WERE

03:48:01.267 --> 03:48:02.235
RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE

03:48:02.301 --> 03:48:03.970
PROGRAM. AND THE PATIENTS WHO

03:48:04.037 --> 03:48:06.072
MATERNAL FETAL KERR IS DICTATED

03:48:06.139 --> 03:48:07.707
BY THESE TESTS. HAVE NOT REALLY

03:48:07.774 --> 03:48:09.542
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.

03:48:09.609 --> 03:48:11.010
OTHERS BEEN SPECIFIC GROUPS

03:48:11.077 --> 03:48:12.378
INVITED TO THESE MEETINGS BUT

03:48:12.445 --> 03:48:14.447
IT'S NOT BEEN AN OPEN PUBLIC

03:48:14.514 --> 03:48:15.815
PROCESS. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A

03:48:15.882 --> 03:48:17.016
PUBLIC HEARING TO BE HELD TO

03:48:17.083 --> 03:48:18.184

CONCERNS. IN REGARD TO THE

03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:22.388
TRANSITION OF THIS PROGRAM. AND

03:48:22.455 --> 03:48:23.923
I REALLY DO THINK IF WE WORK

03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:26.125
TOGETHER WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY

03:48:26.192 --> 03:48:26.793
TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

03:48:26.859 --> 03:48:28.027
THE IMPORTANT UPDATE. WHILE ALSO

03:48:28.094 --> 03:48:30.029
PROTECTING PATIENT ACCESS TO

03:48:30.096 --> 03:48:32.165
THIS NEW TESTING. WE URGE THE

03:48:32.231 --> 03:48:33.633
LEGISLATURE TO CAREFULLY REVIEW

03:48:33.699 --> 03:48:35.168
THE PROPOSAL. AND MAKE ANY

03:48:35.234 --> 03:48:37.003
AMENDMENTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC

03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:39.839
ACCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

OUR PROGRAM TODAY BEFORE THIS

03:49:06.199 --> 03:49:09.836
PROPOSAL OR- IS THAT CONSISTENT

03:49:09.902 --> 03:49:10.970
WITH WHAT THE STATE'S DONE IN

03:49:11.037 --> 03:49:13.840
THE PAST. WELL AS I MENTIONED

03:49:13.906 --> 03:49:15.975
I'M NOT FOR THE PAST THIRTY FIVE

03:49:16.042 --> 03:49:19.312
YEARS. ALL OF PRENATAL SCREENING

03:49:19.378 --> 03:49:21.981
HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH THE STATE

03:49:22.048 --> 03:49:23.316
PROGRAM. IN THE NINETEEN

03:49:23.382 --> 03:49:25.284
EIGHTIES THE INCEPTION OF THE

03:49:25.351 --> 03:49:26.752
PROGRAM AND THEN DEVELOP THAT'S

03:49:26.819 --> 03:49:28.721
THE WAY LAWS REGULATIONS. THAT

03:49:28.788 --> 03:49:31.457
WOULD HAVE MANDATED SCREENING

03:49:31.524 --> 03:49:35.661
DONE. AND HAVE READING- CHANGED

03:49:35.728 --> 03:49:37.363
OVER THE YEARS- ANALYTES HAVE

03:49:37.430 --> 03:49:39.832
BEEN ADDED OTHER CHANGES HAVE

03:49:39.899 --> 03:49:41.134
OCCURRED WITH PRENATAL SCREENING

03:49:41.200 --> 03:49:42.935
THE PROGRAM HAS ADAPTED THOSE

03:49:43.002 --> 03:49:46.305
CHANGES. AND WE SEE THE ADOPTION

03:49:46.372 --> 03:49:49.142
OF THE DNA OF. THE ANOTHER

03:49:49.208 --> 03:49:51.010
CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

03:49:51.077 --> 03:49:51.978
BECAUSE WE'VE DONE OVER THE

03:49:52.044 --> 03:49:55.381
YEARS- THAT WOULD YOU WOULD-

03:49:55.448 --> 03:49:57.416
KERRY OUT AS AMENDED AS A STATE

03:49:57.483 --> 03:50:01.554
WIDE- BROWN THE- BUT STILL

03:50:01.621 --> 03:50:07.460
VOLUNTARY BUT- THE WE ARE.

03:50:07.527 --> 03:50:09.729
OBLIGATED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

03:50:09.795 --> 03:50:12.532
THE LAST FORMING THE SCREENING

03:50:12.598 --> 03:50:15.701
ARE DOING SO IN THE END- TO

03:50:15.768 --> 03:50:18.271
CONFORM FASHION SO THAT THERE IS

03:50:18.337 --> 03:50:20.506
EQUITY IN THEM THE WAY IT

03:50:20.573 --> 03:50:22.341
PROVIDED AS TO WHETHER THERE

03:50:22.408 --> 03:50:24.610
WOULD BE CHOICE- THERE WILL BE

03:50:24.677 --> 03:50:26.712
MULTIPLE LAYOUTS CONTRACTED FROM

03:50:26.779 --> 03:50:29.215
SCREENING INFO- THERE'S NO

03:50:29.282 --> 03:50:35.988
SHORTAGE OF- CHOICES FOR- UP TO

03:50:36.055 --> 03:50:41.394
TWO. SCREENING FOR TRISOMY.

03:50:41.460 --> 03:50:42.428
TWENTY ONE THIRTEEN. COULD I MAY

03:50:42.495 --> 03:50:45.131
FOLLOW UP THEN IF I CAN- EARLIER

03:50:45.198 --> 03:50:46.699
YOU SAID IT WAS BEST IN CLASS

03:50:46.766 --> 03:50:48.367
SERVICE AND THAT THERE WAS NO

03:50:48.434 --> 03:50:50.303
BENEFITS TO THE PATIENT FOR THE-

03:50:50.369 --> 03:50:51.938
POLICY THAT'S BEING PROMOTED

03:50:52.004 --> 03:50:55.007
HERE- I'M I'M TRYING TO

03:50:55.074 --> 03:50:57.577
UNDERSTAND THE BENEFIT FOR THIS.

03:50:57.643 --> 03:51:00.146
DATE TO EMPLOYING. PEOPLE

03:51:00.213 --> 03:51:02.748
OUTSIDE OF OUR STATE WITH PUBLIC

03:51:02.815 --> 03:51:06.586
DOLLARS AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN

03:51:06.652 --> 03:51:08.454
COMMENT ON. WHERE THE BENEFIT

03:51:08.521 --> 03:51:10.990
FOR US IS A SYSTEM TO SENDING

03:51:11.057 --> 03:51:13.192
THOSE RESOURCES OUT OF STATE.

03:51:13.259 --> 03:51:14.360
YEAH EFFORTS TO CIVICALLY FOR

03:51:14.427 --> 03:51:17.296
THAT OUT OF STATE PROCESS- AND

03:51:17.363 --> 03:51:20.199
THAT REALLY IS JUST. BECAUSE OUR

03:51:20.266 --> 03:51:22.535
LABORATORIES- HAVE MULTIPLE

03:51:22.602 --> 03:51:24.370
LOCATON SO THEY'LL HAVE A

03:51:24.437 --> 03:51:24.937
PHYSICAL LOCATION HERE IN

03:51:25.004 --> 03:51:27.139
CALIFORNIA. WHERE THEY DO SOME

03:51:27.206 --> 03:51:28.808
OF THE TESTING BUT IT HAS TO DO

03:51:28.874 --> 03:51:30.576
WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

03:51:30.643 --> 03:51:32.011
TESTING THEY MIGHT HAVE MAYBE A

03:51:32.078 --> 03:51:33.112
MODERATE COMPLEXITY TESTING

03:51:33.179 --> 03:51:34.914
LABORATORY HERE IN CALIFORNIA

03:51:34.981 --> 03:51:35.982
BUT THEN THEY HAVE A HIGH

03:51:36.048 --> 03:51:38.217
COMPLEXITY TESTING LOCATED

03:51:38.284 --> 03:51:39.552
SOMEWHERE ELSE MAYBE IN UTAH OR

03:51:39.619 --> 03:51:41.988
NEVADA. AND IT MAY JUST BE FOR

03:51:42.054 --> 03:51:43.022
PERSONAL REASONS OR SOMETHING

03:51:43.089 --> 03:51:44.857
LIKE THAT AND SO REALLY IT'S

03:51:44.924 --> 03:51:46.759
JUST THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE

03:51:46.826 --> 03:51:48.561
TELLING LABORATORIES WHERE WHICH

03:51:48.628 --> 03:51:50.963
TYPE OF TESTING CAN BE DONE AT

03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:52.698
EACH OTHER FACILITIES THAT'S

03:51:52.765 --> 03:51:53.566
REALLY WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED

03:51:53.633 --> 03:51:56.469
ABOUT. BECAUSE WE DO THINK THAT

03:51:56.535 --> 03:51:57.737
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE

03:51:57.803 --> 03:52:00.840
TESTING IS DONE. YOU KNOW AT A

03:52:00.906 --> 03:52:02.775
THE FACILITY THAT HAD THE PROPER

03:52:02.842 --> 03:52:04.877
OBVIOUSLY PERSONNEL IN- THE

03:52:04.944 --> 03:52:06.979
PROPER RESOURCES. AND IT JUST

03:52:07.046 --> 03:52:10.049
LIMITS THE OPTIONS FOR THE STATE

03:52:10.116 --> 03:52:11.984
AND SO IF THE STATE. WANTS TO

03:52:12.051 --> 03:52:13.886
HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:52:13.953 --> 03:52:14.487
LABORATORIES THAT CAN PERFORM

03:52:14.553 --> 03:52:16.322
THIS TESTING WE JUST THINK IT'S

03:52:16.389 --> 03:52:17.156
LIMITING TO TELL THOSE

03:52:17.223 --> 03:52:19.392
LABORATORIES. THIS SPECIFIC YOU

03:52:19.458 --> 03:52:20.593

03:52:20.660 --> 03:52:22.395
HAS TO BE DONE ONLY GOT ONE OF

03:52:22.461 --> 03:52:23.863
YOUR FACILITIES THAT'S LOCATED

IN STATE. MARYLAND I'LL TURN THE

03:52:26.699 --> 03:52:28.868
QUESTION AS WHETHER OR NOT WE

03:52:28.934 --> 03:52:31.937
HAVE THE CAPACITY WITH THE-

03:52:32.004 --> 03:52:32.972
LABORATORIES WHO WOULD DO THIS

03:52:33.039 --> 03:52:34.840
AND STATE TO DEAL WITH THE

03:52:34.907 --> 03:52:36.075
VOLUME OF TESTING THAT'S

03:52:36.142 --> 03:52:38.277

03:52:44.617 --> 03:52:46.986
THE LABORATORIES THAT HAVE

03:52:47.053 --> 03:52:48.054
APPLIED TO CONTRACT WITH THE

03:52:48.120 --> 03:52:50.656
STATE- HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY

03:52:50.723 --> 03:52:53.926

THAT. THERE ARE SEVERAL

03:53:07.506 --> 03:53:09.909
LABORATORIES IN THE LABORATORIES

03:53:09.975 --> 03:53:11.811
THAT ARE CAPABLE AND HAVE THE

03:53:11.877 --> 03:53:16.849
CAPACITY TO. ALL THE. BUT A

EXPENDITURES FOR THE CURRENT

03:53:59.258 --> 03:54:02.161
YEAR AS A RESULT OF TWO KEY

03:54:02.228 --> 03:54:04.964
FACTORS. FIRST AFTER THE SLIGHT

03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:06.499
DECREASE IN PROJECTED

03:54:06.565 --> 03:54:09.268
PARTICIPATION UP TO THE IN THE

CURRENT YEAR TO NINE HUNDRED

03:54:11.570 --> 03:54:12.405
THIRTY SIX THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS

03:54:12.471 --> 03:54:14.240
EACH ONE. OF THAT IS A SLIGHT

03:54:14.306 --> 03:54:17.243
DECREASE FROM NINE HUNDRED FIFTY

03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:18.310
THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS LAST YEAR

03:54:18.377 --> 03:54:19.979
THAT WE ARE STILL MUCH HIGHER

03:54:20.045 --> 03:54:22.648
THAN PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL OF ABOUT

03:54:22.715 --> 03:54:24.850
EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND

03:54:24.917 --> 03:54:25.918
BUDGET SPENDS EACH MONTH. THE

03:54:25.985 --> 03:54:27.753
SECOND FACTOR IS THE COSTS PER

03:54:27.820 --> 03:54:30.156
PARTICIPANT. THERE WAS A SLIGHT

03:54:30.222 --> 03:54:32.124
DECREASE AND ACTUAL COST PER

03:54:32.191 --> 03:54:35.294
PARTICIPANT. IN THE PRIOR YEAR

03:54:35.361 --> 03:54:36.829
WHICH IMPACTS OUR EXPENDITURE

03:54:36.896 --> 03:54:38.230
PROJECTIONS FOR CURRENT AND

03:54:38.297 --> 03:54:41.000
BUDGET YEAR. THE DECREASE IN THE

03:54:41.066 --> 03:54:42.935
CURRENT YEAR IS OFFSET BY AN

03:54:43.002 --> 03:54:44.336
INCREASE IN BRITAIN BATCH

03:54:44.403 --> 03:54:46.539
VEGETABLE BENEFITS WHICH BEGAN

IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

03:54:48.641 --> 03:54:50.209
AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF

03:54:50.276 --> 03:54:52.344
THIS MONTH AS PART OF FEDERAL

03:54:52.411 --> 03:54:54.413
CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS. THE

03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:56.248
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INCREASE WAS

03:54:56.315 --> 03:54:58.017
INCLUDED IN THE RECENTLY SIGNED

03:54:58.083 --> 03:54:59.919
FEDERAL BUDGET SO IT WILL NOW

03:54:59.985 --> 03:55:02.421
CONTINUE THROUGH SEPTEMBER OF

03:55:02.488 --> 03:55:03.923
TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THEREFORE

03:55:03.989 --> 03:55:07.760
WE WILL MAKE THAT UPDATE IN THE

03:55:07.827 --> 03:55:08.994
MAY BE BEST. THANK YOU. ANY

03:55:09.061 --> 03:55:11.063

THAT UNTIL SEPTEMBER THAT WILL

03:55:18.637 --> 03:55:20.706
GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING

03:55:20.773 --> 03:55:26.612
FOOD INSECURITY ON PAGE-

03:55:26.679 --> 03:55:28.881
SEVENTY. FIVE OF THE AGENDA

03:55:28.948 --> 03:55:31.083
TALKS ABOUT FOOD EXPENDITURE

03:55:31.150 --> 03:55:34.220
ESTIMATE AND ON IT IT SAID THAT

03:55:34.286 --> 03:55:38.958
THERE WAS A DECREASE. IN COSTS

03:55:39.024 --> 03:55:40.926
DUE TO A DECREASE IN FOOD

03:55:40.993 --> 03:55:44.330
INFLATION AND THAT FLIES IN THE

03:55:44.396 --> 03:55:47.399
FACE OF WHAT MANY OF US ARE.

03:55:47.466 --> 03:55:49.168
FEELING AND AWARE ABOUT

03:55:49.235 --> 03:55:51.637
REGARDING CONSUMER PRICES

OVERALL THE FOOD BEING INCLUDED

03:55:53.873 --> 03:55:56.475
IN IT BUT I WAS HOPING YOU COULD

03:55:56.542 --> 03:55:58.177
ELABORATE ON WHETHER OR NOT WE
