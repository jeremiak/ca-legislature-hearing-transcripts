00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.031

WANT THEM TO SHARE WITH YOU

00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:31.937
THEIR EXPERIENCE -- BUT I FIRST

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:32.537
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE

00:24:32.604 --> 00:24:33.371
OTHERS -- WHO AREN'T HERE WITH

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.073
THIS TODAY SHOW HALF WHICH WAS

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.675
PLANNING ON SELLING HER HOME --

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:39.778
IN MADERA ONCE SHE RETIRED AND

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:42.214
IT WAS INITIALLY PRAISE FOR FIVE

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.114
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:43.648
THEN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:44.916
AUTHORITY TOLD HER THAT THE

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.218
TRAIN WAS GOING TO BE BUILT ON

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:47.352
HER PROPERTY.

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:49.354
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO OF

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:51.456
COURSE SHE TRIED TO SELL IT AND

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:52.824
THE REALTORS FOUND IT WAS

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:54.326
IMPOSSIBLE TO SELL THAT HOME

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.261
ONCE PEOPLE DISCOVERED THAT THEY

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.730
WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE TO MOVE

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:00.165
BECAUSE OF THE TRAIN.

00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:01.800
AND THEN THE AUTHORITY -- CAME

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:02.934
IN AND SAID WHAT WE WILL BUY

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:04.769
YOUR HOME BUT THEY ONLY OFFER TO

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:06.438
BUY THE HOME FOR ABOUT A THIRD

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.806
OF ITS VALUE.

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:10.876
SO IT'S A LOSE LOSE ON BOTH ENDS

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:11.977
FOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS.

00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:13.278
MITCH HUTCHERSON WAS THE OWNER

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.213

THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION

00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:20.719
BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:23.255
THE RELOCATION COSTS.

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.422
IF THAT'S YOUR LIVELIHOOD OF

00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:25.390

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:26.625
YOUR FAMILY YOU'RE TOLD YOU HAVE

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:27.525
TO MOVE BECAUSE THE TRAIN IS

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:28.693
GOING TO GO TO YOUR PROPERTY AND

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.028
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE YOUR

00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:30.962
BUSINESS.

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.530
YOUR LIVELIHOOD IS NOW GONE TO

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.866
THAT A TRAIN THAT DOESN'T EXIST

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:36.368
YET CAN GO THROUGH YOUR PROPERTY.

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:38.737
AND THEY WERE CLOSE THEY WERE

00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:39.337
FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR BUSINESS

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:40.005

00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:42.040

HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY FOR

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:52.951
ABOUT HALF OF WHAT IT WOULD HAVE

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:47.272
BEGINNING AT RAND IT STARTED

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:49.074
WITH AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.976
ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO -- BUT WE

I TAKING THESE YOUNG WOMEN IN.

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:15.767
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:18.636
FOUND -- AS WE BELIEVE THAT

00:27:18.703 --> 00:27:21.439
PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE AN ASSET

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:23.108
PEOPLE ARE NOT OUR PROBLEM.

00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:24.743
AND FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE AN

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:26.878
ASSET TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:29.414
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEED FOR

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.317
HOUSING AND OUR COMMITMENT FOR

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.285

AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:38.223
IT REALLY TAKES A PERSPECTIVE

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:39.357
THAT PEOPLE ARE THE MOST

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:41.159
IMPORTANT ASSET THAT LIVES ARE

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:42.694
THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSET AND

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:44.396
THAT WE AS A STATE ARE GOING TO

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:45.463
BE COMMITTED TO FUTURE

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:46.664
GENERATIONS.

00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:48.233
I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:49.901
FOUND AS WE BEGIN TO TAKE THESE

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:51.336
YOUNG WOMEN AND WE TO DATE HAVE

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:53.872

TWENTY SEVEN WOMEN INTO OUR

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.541
HOUSING PROGRAM.

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:58.109
WAS AT THAT NEXT STEP FOR

00:27:58.176 --> 00:27:59.744
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS REALLY

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:02.347
NOT AN OPTION -- WE CAN PASS

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:03.982
BILLS ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:05.817
IN LAST WE HAVE AN OPTION FOR

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:12.757
HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES --

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:14.392
WE CAN'T STOP SUCH ATROCITIES IN

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.126
OUR IN OUR STATE.

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:16.194
I'M WE'D THEN OPENED UP ART

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:17.228
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM YOU

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:18.663
KNOW PARK WHICH WAS A SEVEN

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.132
BEDROOM FOUR BATH HOUSE WHICH

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:23.134
THIS LITTLE ASSET RIGHT HERE HI

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:25.003
SERAPHINE I LIVED IN OUR HOUSING

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.804
PROGRAM.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.739
AND AT IT WAS PURELY GIVING

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:29.307
YOUNG WOMEN THE CHANCE TO

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.942
REBUILD THEIR LIVES IN THE

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:33.244
CONTEXT OF A COMMUNITY.

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:34.579
THAT WAS RAPIDLY CHANGING.

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:35.947
WHEN WE LOOK AT COMMUNITIES

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:38.049
ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE SEE CITIES

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:40.351
LIKE OAKLAND AND SACRAMENTO IN

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:42.053
LOS ANGELES WHERE WE'RE SEEING

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.421
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:44.689
REDEVELOPED?

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:46.558
GENTRIFIED SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE TO

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:47.859
USE THAT WORD.

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.127
BUT I BELIEVE THAT IF WE ARE

00:28:49.194 --> 00:28:51.463
INTENTIONAL ABOUT REBUILDING

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.431
HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:54.866
CAN AFFORD TO LIVE AND TO

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.334
PARTICIPATE IN TO BE A PART OF

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.369
IT WE WILL SEE.

00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:01.139
SYSTEMIC ISSUES BEGAN TO CHANGE

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.208
WE WILL SEE EDUCATION BEGAN TO

00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:04.776
CHANGE WE WILL SEE.

00:29:04.843 --> 00:29:06.478

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:17.054
INTER TWINED WHAT I WILL SAY TO

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:20.291
YOU THOUGH IS THAT -- IF THERE

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:24.395
TO CONNECT.

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:25.162
TO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:26.530
TRAIN IN A TRAIN BUILT IN THE

00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:28.365
CENTRAL VALLEY DOESN'T HELP

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:29.967
THOSE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.068
DOESN'T HELP THOSE IN NORTHERN

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.536
CALIFORNIA WE ARE NUMBER ONE IN

00:39:32.603 --> 00:39:34.371
POVERTY IN THE NATION WE HAVE

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:35.573
THE MOST NUMBER OF HOMELESS

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:37.174
PEOPLE IN THE NATION.

00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:39.577
THAT IS A TRAVESTY AND THIS BILL

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:41.812

DUE LIKE MANY OTHERS THIS BILL

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:46.450
SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.219
BECAUSE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:49.320
IGNORE THAT.

00:39:49.386 --> 00:39:51.722
RIGHT -- AND I DON'T DISAGREE

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.157
WITH YOU THAT TRANSPORTATION IS

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:56.627
A IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY IT IS BUT

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.429
I ALSO DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.297
ANYTHING WRONG WITH PUTTING THIS

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:02.032
BACK BEFORE THE VOTERS. TO GIVE

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:04.101
THEM ANOTHER CHANCE TO WEIGH IN

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.370
ON THIS -- AND GIVEN THE FACT

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:07.571
THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.974
MEDIA ATTENTION GIVEN TO OUR

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.042
HOMELESS SITUATION THAT IS NOT

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.777
GETTING BETTER IT IS GETTING

00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:13.611
WORSE.

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:15.746
AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUCH A

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:17.181
HIGH NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.182
POVERTY.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:19.617
I THINK THE VOTERS DESERVE THE

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:21.452
CHANCE TO HAVE THIS PUT BEFORE

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:22.686
THEM AGAIN AND MAKE THEIR

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.755
DECISION IT IS IT'S THEIR MONEY

THEY ARE THE ONES THAT APPROVED

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:27.191
THE PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.526
CERTAINLY WE SHOULD GIVE THEM

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.227
THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THIS

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:33.063

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:33.998
OWE IT TO THEM TO DO THAT I

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.766
DON'T THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE I

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:37.635
FRANKLY THINK IT'S A BIT

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:40.271
DISRESPECTFUL TO NOT PUT IT

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:42.006
BEFORE THEN GIVEN THE FACT THAT.

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:43.941
THE HOUSING CRISIS HAS GONE ON

00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:45.209
FOR SO LONG AND IN CALIFORNIA

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.343
AND WE ALL AGREE WE NEED TO DO

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.645
SOMETHING ABOUT IT RIGHT.

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:49.480

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:50.720
THINGS LIKE TREE REMOVAL BUT

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:51.788
CLEARLY AND I THINK THE

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:53.790
GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY DECLARATION

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.125

MORE IS NEEDED.

00:54:58.261 --> 00:54:59.763
THE WHOLE POINT OF CAP AND TRADE

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.831

DON'T EVEN HAPPENED AT ALL

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:17.547
CONTINUES TO OCCUR -- I THINK

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:18.715
THAT'S INTO A COMPLETELY

00:55:18.782 --> 00:55:21.484
APPROPRIATE USE OF CAP AND TRADE

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.988

SYSTEM BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND

SAN DIEGO WILL ROOM WILL RESULT

00:55:38.334 --> 00:55:41.037
IN A NET INCREASE OF GREENHOUSE

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:44.207
GAS EMISSIONS -- NOW YOU LOOK AT

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:46.776
THE WILD FIRES FROM LAST YEAR

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.378

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:51.448
RESULT OF THESE FIRES CARBON

EMISSIONS -- THAT'S ROUGHLY THE

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:55.819
AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT IT TAKES

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:59.322

IN THE STATE FOR ONE YEAR.

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:01.458

FIREFIGHTERS MORE MONEY FOR

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:04.294

KEEP HUNDREDS OF TEENS ALIVE

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.239
EVERY YEAR.

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:51.440
I'M ONLY GOING TO CALM IT GETS

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:53.008
THESE ARE THE AUTHORS ALREADY

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.176
COMMENTED ON A NUMBER OF

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.744
COMPONENTS ALL I'M HERE TO

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:58.614
TESTIFY ON TECHNICAL ISSUES.

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.082
BUT THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.083
ARE WANTED JUST KIND OF

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.317
CRYSTALLIZED.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:05.087
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVERY YEAR

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.321
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:12:06.388 --> 01:12:08.123
A THIRD OF A HIGH SCHOOL IS

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:10.926
KILLED EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:13.228
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE GDL

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:15.898
COVERING THIS FULL AGE GROUP.

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:18.067
A THIRD OF A HIGH SCHOOL DIES

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:19.702
EVERY YEAR AND FAR MORE ARE

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:21.303
HOSPITALIZED.

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:22.604
THE OTHER THING THAT THIS BILL

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:24.973
HAS ACCOMPLISHED IS NEGOTIATING

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.209
OVER TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.711
THE CHANGES THAT THIS BILL

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.979
BRINGS ABOUT IS PAID.

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:32.881
FOR THROUGH THE FEES THAT ARE

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:35.317
ALREADY A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:36.852
THE DMV IN OUR LICENSE DRIVER

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.120
EDUCATION SCHOOL SO THERE'S

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.655
PLENTY OF MONEY TO PAY FOR THE

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:40.622
PROGRAM.

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:43.492
THIS IS NOT A NEW PROGRAM DMV

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:45.294
DOES THIS IS BEEN COMING THEY

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.528
WERE THE SIGNATORY ON THE

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:49.064
STRATEGIC HIGHWAY SAFETY PLAN.

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:50.566
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A BIG

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:52.501
LIFT FOR THEM TO CHANGE THIS IT

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:55.337
WILL TAKE SOME WORK BUT THIS IS

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:55.938
NOT THE THING THAT'S GOING TO

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:56.138
KEEP.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:59.174
THE DMV FROM BECOMING A SOUND

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:00.642
AND NON CHALLENGED PLACE.

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:05.147
THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THIS

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:05.347
BILL.

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.515
AND IT'S A PROGRAM THAT IS BEEN

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:07.349
ON THE LANDSCAPE FOR A LONG TIME

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:08.183
THERE WILL BE SOME CHANGES BUT

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.685
IT'S JUST AN AGE CHANGE THAT WE

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:10.953
HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:12.688
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO STRESS

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.523
IS THAT A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.859

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.564
ACCIDENTS GETS DISTRACTED

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:58.267
DRIVING IS THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF

01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.067
THE ACCIDENT THAT KILLED THESE

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:40.195
THAT DO NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:44.366
GDL THEIR FATALITY CRASH RATE IS

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:45.667
4260% HIGHER.

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:48.737
IT'S 55% HIGHER THAN THOSE

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:49.905
SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.740
THAT GO THROUGH GDL AND THOSE

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:53.108
ARE FATAL ACCIDENTS RIGHT NOW I

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.409
UNDERSTAND I GUESS I'M JUST

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:55.377
MAKING THE POINT THAT I THINK

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:58.246
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF STRONG

01:16:58.313 --> 01:16:58.714
CORRELATION.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.614
BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.216
AS TAKING TO POPULATIONS THAT

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.118
ARE THE SAME AND THEN HAVING ONE

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:03.952
GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND ONE

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:05.020
NOT THESE ARE THESE ARE

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:06.888
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS ONE IS

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:08.924
OLDER -- THERE'S A VARIETY OF

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:10.559
REASONS SO I'M JUST I GUESS MY

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.461
POINT IS JUST I WAS NINE I THINK

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.129
THIS PROGRAM IS GREAT AND I'M

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:18.367
SURE THERE IS.

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:19.935
I DON'T THINK THAT THE CORAL IF

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:21.803
YOU KNOW YOUR YOU ARE TALKING TO

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.505
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND PEOPLE

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:24.573
WHO ARE SELF SELECTING WHETHER

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:26.308
IT'S TO GET THEIR LICENSE AT A

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.877
CERTAIN AGE OR NOT -- SO I DON'T

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:29.644
THINK THAT.

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:30.345
THE BECAUSE I DON'T THE

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:32.014
CORRELATION IS EXACTLY IS SORT

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.449
OF SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN AS

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:35.884
YOU'RE MAKING IT OUT TO BE I'M

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.119
NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT SOME

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:38.920
CORRELATION THERE BUT IT'S NOT

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.288
THE SAME AS IF YOU TOOK ONE

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.923
GROUP OF SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.226
AND ONE GROUP THAT YOU KNOW AND

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.727
AND ONE PORT ONE GROUP OF

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:46.728
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS.

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.130
THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AND

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:50.766
RANDOMIZE THEM TO TWO DIFFERENT --

01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:52.401
TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IT'S A

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:53.535
LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:57.172
DIFFERENT AND WHAT YEAR OLD

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:57.873
MIGHT YOU KNOW DR.

01:17:57.939 --> 01:17:58.673
DIFFERENTLY THEY HAVE TWO MORE

01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.508
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THEY MAY

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:00.375
DRIVE DIFFERENTLY THAN EIGHTEEN

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:00.976
YEAR OLD GETTING A LICENSE FOR

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:01.810
THE FIRST TIME I'M JUST SAYING

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:02.778
THAT IF YOU PUT EIGHTEEN

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.079
ENROLLED IN THE SAME PROGRAM YOU

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.347
MIGHT NOT GET THE EXACT SAME

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:06.915
RESULT AS PUTTING SOMEBODY

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:07.516
FIFTEEN INTO IT.

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:09.051
THAT'S ALL I'M NOT I'M NOT

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.352
ARGUING I'M JUST SAYING YOU'RE

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.654
NOT EXACTLY THE SAME POPULATIONS

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:14.256
THAT WE WE HAVE CRASH DATA FROM

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:15.724
INDIANA IN NEW JERSEY THAT HAVE

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.225
GONE TO TWENTY ONE SO WE KNOW

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.794
WHAT THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:19.995
TWENTY OR LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY

WHEN THEY GO THROUGH ITS.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.067
BUT YOUR YOUR POINTS WILL TAKE.

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.134
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA YEAH --

THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR -- SAW.

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:35.043
THE TRAGEDIES OF SOMETIMES --

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:37.913
YOUNG PEOPLE AGO GOT INVOLVED IN

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:40.982
AN AND AND ALSO -- NUMEROUS

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.684

THE LAST TIME AND WHEN I THANK

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:47.522

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:49.791
FORWARD AGAIN THIS YEAR AND I

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:53.728
WILL SUPPORT IT AGAIN.

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:54.930

WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM KIDS ARE

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:01.670

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:15.183
I THINK THAT'S A FAIR POINT

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.351
ABOUT THE DATA BUT I DO THINK

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.153
THERE'S SOME DATA SUGGESTING AT

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.722
LEAST THAT -- THEPUBLIC SAFETY

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:21.857

ABSOLUTELY.

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:13.728
THIS GROUP THAT HAS PUT THIS

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.263
TOGETHER IT HAS BEEN DOING THIS

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:17.699
FOR ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS THEY'VE

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:19.367

THAT ROUTE CURRENTLY AND WHEN

01:27:23.237 --> 01:27:24.772
THEY WERE QUITE SURE WHAT STEPS

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:26.874
TO TAKE AND NOT REALIZING THIS

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:27.842
IS THE VERY FIRST STEP WE NEED

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:28.610
TO TAKE.

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:29.911
BUT THEY'VE ALREADY DONE PUBLIC

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.312
OUTREACH WE HAVE HAD CINEMA

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:32.981
COUNTY -- COME ON BOARD NAPA

01:27:33.047 --> 01:27:34.882
COUNTY SO WE HAVE THE COUNTY

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:35.717
SOMEWHERE BUT WE HAVE TO WORK

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.452
WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS WE DO

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:39.020
KNOW THE SIGNAGE ISSUES.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.388
SO WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:41.823

DONE INCREDIBLE PUBLIC OUTRAGE

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:50.131
MOVING FORWARD AND I THINK THAT --

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:51.399
IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT A LOT OF

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:52.734
OUR AREA THIS GOING THROUGH A

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.804
LOT OF ECONOMIC TURMOIL SINCE

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:58.506

IT'S ACTUALLY.

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:02.243
BEEN A PART OF ONE OF THOSE

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:03.444
PROCESS SEES -- HAVING BEEN A

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.679
COUNTY SUPERVISOR WHERE IT

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:09.217
THAT HAPPEN AND THEN IT WAS.

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:10.084
BROUGHT TO THE BOARD OF

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:13.921
SUPERVISORS WERE ULTIMATELY IT --

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:14.689

MODIFIED FOR THE AREA THAT WAS

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:17.725
TO BE TRAVEL.

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:19.927
WHAT US IN SUIT THERE WAS A REAL

01:28:19.994 --> 01:28:21.663
CHALLENGE FOR THE PEOPLE BECAUSE

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.631
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD NICE WHITE

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:24.799
PICKET FENCES COULD NO LONGER

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:25.199
HAVEA?

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:26.601
THOSE AT HIM MAILBOXES CAN NO

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:28.736
LONGER HAVE A THOSE IT HAD JUST

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:29.470
A FIELD FENCE TO KEEP THEIR

COULD NO LONGER HAVE IT.

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:40.748
SO THERE'S A LOT OF LAND USE

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:41.315
ISSUES.

FIRST OF SUPPORTERS WANT YOU TO

01:41:17.137 --> 01:41:18.272
BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:19.440

01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:43.063
CAN BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:44.531
IN FACT THE RISE OF NUMBER

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:45.699
LICENSE SCHOOLS HAS INCREASED

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:47.501
COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY AND

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:49.102
RESULTING IN LOWERING THE COST

01:41:49.169 --> 01:41:50.938
OF TRAFFIC SCHOOL COURSES WHICH

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:52.406

YOUR TRIBE TRAFFIC SCHOOL SHOULD

01:42:15.829 --> 01:42:17.331
BE IMPORTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE.

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:18.499
IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS INTENSE

01:42:18.565 --> 01:42:19.800
COMPETITION DOUBLE SOME

THEY DOMINATED THE INDUSTRY.

01:42:26.773 --> 01:42:27.941

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:42.022
PROBLEMS BUT WILL ONLY BRING ON

01:42:42.089 --> 01:42:44.057
NEW PROBLEMS AND HARM SOME VERY

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:45.325
ETHICAL TVS IS.

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:46.994
SUCH AS MY OWN IT IS VAGUE

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.629
LANGUAGE IN THIS CURRENT TVS

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:50.330
REGULATIONS THAT MADE IT IS THE

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:51.765
CURRENT TVS REGULATIONS THAT

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:55.102
MADE IT EASY FOR ME IN OUR GROUP

01:42:55.168 --> 01:42:56.270
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS.

01:42:56.336 --> 01:42:59.406
USING A AN UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESS

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:01.608
PRACTICES.

01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:02.442
AS MR SOLD THIS MENTIONED MR MAN

01:43:02.509 --> 01:43:03.977
ARGUES THE EXACT SAME WEBSITE

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:05.946
ADDRESS FOR HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:08.448
WHICH IS A CLEAR PROBLEM HOWEVER

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.150
ANOTHER NO NO WE'RE IN THEIR

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:12.386
CURRENT LEGISLATION IS THERE PRO --

01:43:12.452 --> 01:43:13.220
PROPOSED BUDGET LOCAL

01:43:13.287 --> 01:43:15.222
LEGISLATION IS A LANGUAGE TRYING

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:16.757
TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:18.559
IF THIS BILL PASSES CURRENT LAW

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:19.693
ABIDING SCHOOL BE NECK.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.595
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHICH IS

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:24.765
PART OF THE SUPPORTERS INTENDS

01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:27.467
TO WE CAN COMPETITION.

01:43:27.534 --> 01:43:28.402
THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE INDUSTRY

01:43:28.468 --> 01:43:29.503
THIS BILL AS AMENDED IS UNFAIR

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.305
VAGUE AND WILL BE VERY COSTLY

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:32.339
FOR THE DMV.

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:33.607
CURRENTLY EACH LICENSE SCHOOL

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:35.275
HAS A REQUIREMENT TO PAY YEARLY

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:37.344
DMV LICENSE FEE A HUNDRED

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:38.612
SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS UP TWO

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:39.479
HUNDRED AND FIVE DOLLARS.

01:43:39.546 --> 01:43:41.148
THE MUST CARRY FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:43:41.214 --> 01:43:42.716
ARE BOND AMONG OTHER FINANCIAL

01:43:42.783 --> 01:43:44.117
REQUIREMENTS BY MEETING THESE

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:46.253
REQUIREMENTS CURRENT LEGISLATION

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.788
GRANTS EACH LICENSE SCHOOL THE

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:49.289
RIGHT TO AN INDIVIDUAL LISTING

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:50.424
ON THE LIST.

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.359
IF A GROUP OF SCHOOLS ONLY PURE

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:53.860
ONCE ON THE LIST.

01:43:53.927 --> 01:43:55.829
AS THEY ARE PROPOSING IT IS ONLY

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:57.397
LOGICAL THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:59.766
PAY ONE LICENSING FEE ONE BOND

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:00.767
AT CETERA.

01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:01.802
HOWEVER THE PROPOSED BILL DOES

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:03.170
NOT AMEND ANY OF THE CURRENT

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:04.838
LEGISLATION LANGUAGE TO REFLECT

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:05.639
THIS.

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:07.541
THIS BILL ALSO FAILS TO EXPLAIN

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:08.442
HOW THE SCHOOLS WE GROUP ON A

01:44:08.508 --> 01:44:10.277
LIST WILL ONLY ONE OF THE SCHOOL

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:12.279
MAYES WE LISTED IF THERE IS ONLY

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:13.513
ONE LISTING PER GROUP HOW WILL

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.182
THE PUBLIC BE ABLE TO VERIFY THE

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:16.683
LICENSE NUMBERS OF EACH SCHOOL

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:17.618
IN THE GROUP.

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:18.852
IS IT FAIR THAT THE COURTS AND

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:20.220
PUBLIC ARE LEFT STRUGGLING TO

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:21.555
MAKE SENSE OF IT ALL.

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.190
BUT THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT OF

01:44:23.256 --> 01:44:25.325
ALL IS THE WAY THE BILL DEFINES

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:26.760
AFFILIATED TRAFFIC SO THEY'LL

01:44:26.827 --> 01:44:28.462
MAY LATER SCHOOLS OR THE WAY

01:44:28.528 --> 01:44:29.997
THEY TRY TO GROUP THE SCHOOLS

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:31.465
LEAVING THE WIDE OPEN FOR

01:44:31.531 --> 01:44:33.400
MISINTERPRETATION AND ABUSE.

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:35.402
LET ME EXPLAIN THE BILL SITES

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:37.237
FOUR CRITERIA IN A SCHOOL WE

01:44:37.304 --> 01:44:38.905
NEED TO MEET ONE OF THE CRITERIA

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:39.906
TO BE CONSIDERED PART AN

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:41.241
AFFILIATED GROUP WITH ANOTHER

01:44:41.308 --> 01:44:42.142
SCHOOL.

01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:43.644
EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT AFFILIATED

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:45.479
AT ALL UNDER THIS BILL TWO

01:44:45.545 --> 01:44:46.780
SEPARATE SCHOOLS COULD HAVE

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:48.715
THEIR LICENSES REVOKED FOR ONE

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:49.182
YEAR.

01:44:49.249 --> 01:44:50.951
ON A FIRST OFFENSE AND FIVE

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:52.519
YEARS FOR SECOND OFFENSE IF THEY

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:58.125
FEEL TO REPORTER AFFILIATION.

01:44:58.191 --> 01:45:00.160
BASED ON THIS DEFINITION TO

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:01.528
SCHOOLS CANNOT BE. ONE BASED ON

01:45:01.595 --> 01:45:02.562
THE CRITERIA FOR AFFILIATION IS

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:03.597
TO SCHOOLS CANNOT BE IN THE SAME

01:45:03.664 --> 01:45:04.131
BUILDING.

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:05.499
IF FOR EXAMPLE OF TRAFFIC SCHOOL

01:45:05.565 --> 01:45:07.734
ABC IS ALREADY IN GREAT BUILDING

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:09.770
WITH LOW RENT I CAN'T HAVE MY

01:45:09.836 --> 01:45:11.405
OFFICE IN THE SAME BUILDING OR I

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:13.006
WILL CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:14.741
GROUP OF LICENSE I'M SO I WILL

01:45:14.808 --> 01:45:16.476
BEGROUP ALONG WITH THAT EVEN

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:17.044
THOUGH.

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:18.645
I MAY NOT EVEN KNOW THE COMPANY.

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:20.147
AND BOTH OF OUR LICENSES WILL BE

01:45:20.213 --> 01:45:22.149
REVOKED. TWO TVS IS COULD NOT

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:23.283
SHARE THE SAME COMPUTER NETWORK

01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:24.851
OR SERVER WHICH MEANS THAT IF TO

01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:26.153
SCHOOLS ARE USING THE SAME

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:27.421
HOSTING SERVICES SUCH AS GO

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:29.356
GOOGLE GO THAT OUR AMAZON WEB

01:45:29.423 --> 01:45:31.925
SERVICES.

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:33.493
YOUR CONSIDER GROUP.

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.461
THE SHARING OF TELEPHONE

01:45:34.528 --> 01:45:36.029
SERVICES MANY LET A LEGITIMATE

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:37.297
SMALLER SCHOOLS GOING TO UTILIZE

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:38.899
THE SAME ANSWERING SERVICE WHICH

01:45:38.965 --> 01:45:40.534
SPECIALIZES IN THIS INDUSTRY

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.568
THIS WOULD AND THAT'S REALLY FOR

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:43.336
SMALLER TVS IS TO OCCUR HARD

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:44.037
COSTS.

01:45:44.104 --> 01:45:46.606
BECAUSE IT SAYS THEY CAN NO

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:47.708
LONGER USE THIS TYPE OF SERVICE.

01:45:47.774 --> 01:45:49.309
AND WHAT ABOUT THE VERY REAL

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:50.677
POSSIBILITY THAT ONCE SIR I

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:52.946
THINK -- WE WOULD TRY TO KEEP

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:54.247
TIME LIMIT I UNDERSTAND BOTH

01:45:54.314 --> 01:45:56.316
SIDES -- ONE MORE MINUTE I

01:45:56.383 --> 01:45:58.185
REALLY AM FOUR POINT I'M SORRY I

01:45:58.251 --> 01:45:59.453
APPRECIATE I APOLOGIZE.

01:45:59.519 --> 01:46:00.887
UP AND THERE'S ALSO A HUGE

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:02.689
POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE THE WAY

01:46:02.756 --> 01:46:04.524
THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN ANOTHER

01:46:04.591 --> 01:46:06.026
SCHOOL CAN SIMPLY LEASED SPACE

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:07.461
IN THE SAME BUILDING HIGHER THE

01:46:07.527 --> 01:46:09.029
SAME TELEPHONE CALL CENTER OR

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:10.464
EVEN TO USE THE SAME WEBSITE

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:11.665
HOSTING COMPANY.

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:14.534
AND THAT'LL AUTOMATICALLY.

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:17.003
GROUP THEM AND IT LONG AND THEY

01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:18.138
WOULD HAVE NOT MENTIONED UP TO

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:19.172
THE DMV AND THEY'LL LOSE THEIR

01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:20.907
LICENSE FOR A YEAR FOR LEASE FOR

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:23.276
THE FIRST OFFENSE -- THE LEGAL

01:46:23.343 --> 01:46:27.748
ADMINISTRATIVE -- BOTH PARTS OF

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:30.150
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE FOR THE DMV.

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:30.817
I DO HAVE A COUPLE THINGS TO SAY

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:31.518
BUT I THINK I PRETTY MUCH

01:46:31.585 --> 01:46:32.886
COVERED IT I DO APPRECIATE THE

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.187
COMMITTEE'S TIME.

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:35.388
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:36.189
BEFORE WE GET TO COMMITTEE

01:46:36.256 --> 01:46:37.991
QUESTIONS ANY ADDITIONAL

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:43.563
SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION.

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:45.332
SEEING NONE.

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:47.033
I SAW SOMEONE GET UPSET IT AS

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:47.634
SEEN ON ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:46:47.701 --> 01:46:49.569
COMMITTEE.

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:50.604
IT'S GOING IN.

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:53.106
YEAH THIS IS MORE OF A QUESTION.

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:54.574
FOR THE OPPOSITION.

01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:56.176
YEAH I HAVE I'M LOOKING AT THE

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:57.844
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND IT SAYS

01:46:57.911 --> 01:46:59.913
TEXAS HAS FIFTY SEVEN OF THESE

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:02.249
SCHOOLS FLORIDA THIRTY THREE

01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:03.717
FIFTEEN IN NEW YORK.

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.585
SURE THE LARGEST POPULATION

01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:08.021
STATES RELATIVES CALIFORNIA.

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:10.157
UP WE'VE TWENTY NINE HUNDRED I I

01:47:10.223 --> 01:47:10.891
I GUESS I JUST WANT.

01:47:10.957 --> 01:47:11.925
I GET THAT YOU DON'T THINK THE

01:47:11.992 --> 01:47:14.494
BILL'S PERFECT IN THEIR ASPECTS

01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:15.061
OF THE PARTICULARS YOU DON'T

01:47:15.128 --> 01:47:16.963
LIKE BUT ON A GENERAL LEVEL LIKE

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:18.532
WHO BENEFITS FROM HAVING.

01:47:18.598 --> 01:47:19.900
LIKE WOOD MISTER WHAT SHOWED US

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:21.334
THESE PAGES THE COURTS HAND OUT

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:22.769
WITH THOUSANDS OF THESE THINGS

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:24.638
ON THIS ESSENTIALLY JUST.

01:47:24.704 --> 01:47:25.472
A RANDOM.

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:27.240
DARK THROWS TO WHO GETS THE

01:47:27.307 --> 01:47:28.775
BUSINESS AT A HOUSE THAT

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.177
BENEFITING THE CONSUMERS OR THE

01:47:30.243 --> 01:47:32.312
OR THE SYSTEM OR HELPING PEOPLE

01:47:32.379 --> 01:47:35.215
CLEAR UP TICKETS I DON'T I JUST

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:37.083
DON'T GET IT [inaudible]

01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:38.552
WELL.

01:47:38.618 --> 01:47:39.419
THANK YOU.

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:40.320
WELL AS FAR AS FEW OF THE OTHER

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:42.956
STATES TEXAS FOR EXAMPLE HAS A

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:43.523
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:44.491
APPLICATION FEE.

01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:47.694
SO IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO GET

01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:49.229
ON THERE MORE THAN ONCE.

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:51.264
THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN.

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:53.133
ENTRY THAT TEXAS DOES HAVE A NEW

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:54.835
YORK HAS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN

01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:56.069
SCHOOLS NEW YORK HAS BEEN IN A

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:57.637
PILOT PROGRAM FOR ALMOST TEN

01:47:57.704 --> 01:47:59.539
YEARS NOW -- THE STATE HOUSE

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:01.074
COMPLETELY SHUT IT DOWN IF I

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:02.175
WANTED TO START A COUPLE --

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:03.243
TRAFFIC'S WOUND AT NEW YORK I

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:04.678
CANNOT BECAUSE BUT LEGISLATION

01:48:04.744 --> 01:48:06.680
WILL NOT ALLOW ME INTO THE PILOT

01:48:06.746 --> 01:48:08.048
PROGRAM IS FINISHED.

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:09.916
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:10.550
TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SCHOOLS ON

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:12.052
THE LIST AND YOU KNOW TWO

01:48:12.118 --> 01:48:12.953
THOUSAND AND BEING FOR ONE

01:48:13.019 --> 01:48:16.556
SCHOOL IS RIDICULOUS ESPECIALLY

01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:18.058
THE WAY THEY'RE DOING IT.

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:19.392
THERE IS AN OLD MAIN BENEFIT TO

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:20.427
IT BUT MY ARGUMENT ISN'T

01:48:20.493 --> 01:48:22.295
NECESSARILY TO ALLOW TO HAVE TWO

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:23.663
THOUSAND SCHOOLS MY ARGUMENT IS

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:24.965
THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:26.066
CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

01:48:26.132 --> 01:48:28.134
IT IS JUST A RECIPE FOR DISASTER

01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:30.237
L. AS I EXPLAINED.

01:48:30.303 --> 01:48:32.272
IT WILL.

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:34.007
THE BILL IT FOR ONE SCHOOL TO

01:48:34.074 --> 01:48:35.976
SABOTAGE ANOTHER AND ABILITY AYE

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:37.043
I COULD GO AND RENT AN OFFICE
