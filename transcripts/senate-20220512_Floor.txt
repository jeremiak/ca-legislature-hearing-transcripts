BY SENATOR WIENER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY SIX BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO MINORS CENTER WINNER IS READY CENTER WE KNOW YOUR RECOGNIZED I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES- SB EIGHT SIXTY SIX- WILL ALLOW- TEENAGERS IT'S ALL THE SEVENTEEN TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HEALTH- BY GETTING. VACCINATED AND OF COURSE LIMITED THE VACCINES THAT ARE APPROVED BY THE FDA. AND THAT MEET THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES. SB EIGHT SIXTY SIX- IS BUILT ON A LONG STANDING EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT ALLOWS TEENAGERS TO MAKE CERTAIN MEDICAL DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES- UNDER EXISTING LONG STANDING CALIFORNIA LAW- TEENAGERS CAN RECEIVE THE HPV VACCINE AND A HEPATITIS B. VACCINE ON THEIR OWN. IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER- SEXUAL HEALTH TREATMENT. TEENAGERS ON THEIR OWN- CAN SEEK AND OBTAIN A TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT- FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL RELATED DISORDERS. AND FOR OTHER CONDITIONS RIGHT NOW WE TRUSTED EDITORS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. FOR THEMSELVES OF MINORS OF ANY AGE CAN CONSENT TO BIRTHCONTROL. AND ABORTION. YES A TEENAGER CANNOT GO IN AND GET A FLU SHOT. UNLESS THEIR PARENTS ARE CONSENT. EVEN IF A TEENAGER DESPERATELY WANTS A VACCINE WANTS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HEALTH RIGHT NOW THEY CANNOT DO SO ON THEIR OWN AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY TEENAGERS THAT WANT TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HEALTH AND THEY'RE UNABLE TO DO SO WHETHER BECAUSE A PARENT DOESN'T BELIEVE IN VACCINES AND IS PROHIBITING THEM. FROM PROTECTING THEIR OWN HEALTH. OR WHETHER BECAUSE OF MEDICAL NEGLECT. AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALL TOO MANY CHILDREN IN THE STATE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MEDICAL NEGLECT. OR BECAUSE A PARENT IS SIMPLY TOO BUSY TO GET AROUND TO IT OR GETS DELAYED. AND THEN IT'S THAT TEENAGERS HEALTH THAT IS ON THE LINE AS A RESULT- THERE ARE OTHER STATES WE WILL NOT BE THE FIRST THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW TEENAGERS- TO GROWING IT BACK SENATE ON THEIR OWN INCLUDING RHODE ISLAND SOUTH CAROLINA OREGON ALABAMA AND WASHINGTON. DC R. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT COBRA I KNOW THAT IS WHAT'S YOU KNOW MINE FOR ALL OF US OBVIOUSLY. BUT THIS IS ABOUT ANY VACCINE THAT IS RECOMMENDED. FOR THIS AGE GROUP WE KNOW THAT MEASLES TRAGICALLY WE THOUGHT WE HAD ELIMINATED AND THE U. S. IT'S BACK- WE KNOW- THAT MONTHS IS STILL AROUND. WE KNOW THAT EVEN POLIO WHICH WE HAVE ELIMINATED IN THIS COUNTRY IS STILL CIRCULATING IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD AND COULD COME BACK TO THE U. S. IF. THE MISINFORMATION AND HESITANCY CONTINUES. AND THIS IS ABOUT ALLOWING. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HEALTH. AND WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT. NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA TEENAGERS ARE NOT VACCINATED AGAINST CODE NINETEEN VACCINES AS WELL LARGE NUMBERS OF TEENS WHO ARE NOT VACCINATED MANY OF WHOM WOULD LIKE TO GET VACCINATED AND WOULD DO SO IF WE RECOGNIZED THEIR AGENCY AND THEIR AUTONOMY TO DO SO. WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR WINNER SENATOR NIELSEN. MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THIS IS BUT A NOTHER OF THE CONTINUE. OF LEGISLATION TO UNDERMINE PARENTAL AUTHORITY AND PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY. PARACHA SHOULD ALWAYS BE INVOLVED IN DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN PARTICULARLY THE YOUNGEST AND THIS IS OF THAT CLASS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY AGENCIES ENTITIES. THE SIDE THEY KNOW BETTER THAN THE BLOOD BOND OF PARENTHOOD. IT'S A CONCERN TO ME GREATLY FOR AMERICAN SOCIETY THE AUTHORITY AND THE ABILITY OF PARENTS. TO CONTROL AND INPUT DECISIONS OTHER MORE MINOR CHILDREN. SEVENTEEN YUP THAT'S GETTING ON ITS WAY TO MATURITY BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE YET. AND IT DOES NOT SERVE US TO CONTINUE TO TAKE AWAY THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BLOOD BOND PARENTS OF OUR YOUTH IRISH A NOBLE. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR OF S. B. EIGHT SIXTY SIX AS WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASING POLITICIZATION OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC THIS BILL IS A SOUND AND SADLY NECESSARY PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO HAS ALREADY NOTED QUITE CLEARLY THE MEASURE BEFORE US. APPLIES TO VACCINATIONS SHERLEY AND WILL NOT FORCE TEENS TO GET VACCINATED RATHER IT EMPOWERS YOUNG PEOPLE OVER TWELVE YEARS OLD TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE EMINENTLY FULL OPTION OF PROTECTING THEIR OWN HEALTH IS PART OF BEING RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE AMPLE PROOF THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SMART ENOUGH AND FULLY CAPABLE OF MAKING INFORMED AND INTELLIGENT DECISIONS. AND WHILE WE SHOULD ALWAYS GRANT DEFERENCE TO FAMILIES IN THE COMPLICATED AND PERSONAL BUSINESS OF RAISING CHILDREN WE SHOULD NOT IN THE MIDST OF THIS CHALLENGING A PRECARIOUS TIME ALLOW THE POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS VIEWS OF SOMEONE'S PARENTS TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT PERSON PROTECTING HIS OR HER OWN HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF OTHERS. IN THIS MOMENT INDEED ON THIS DAY ON WHICH AMERICANS BEAR WITNESS TO THE INCREDIBLY SAD AND UNDER THE MILESTONE OF OVER ONE MILLION DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE BY COVERT THIS MEASURE COULD NOT BE MORE TIMELY MORE MORE VALID AND NOT WITHSTANDING ALL OF THE POLITICS AND POLARIZATION OF THE PANDEMIC IT IS A FACT. THAT THE VACCINES DEVELOPED AGAINST THE STARS KOBE TO VIRUS AND ITS VARIANTS SUB BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY AND THOROUGHLY PROVEN TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM SEVERE OUTCOMES ESPECIALLY FROM DYING MOREOVER AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY AT POINT THERE'S COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE THE COVERT VACCINES ARE SAFE. AS SAFE AS ANY OF THE OTHER LIFE SAVING IMMUNIZATIONS TO WHICH WE PUBLIC. AND THE STEADY EXCHANGE OF LIFESPANS IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY THE MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE LIFESAVING VACCINES THE SOONER WE CAN PUT THE PANDEMIC. FULLY BEHIND US EMPOWERING YOUNG PEOPLE WITH ACCESS TO CODE VACCINES IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING STUDENTS IN SCHOOL NOT ONLY FOR THEIR EDUCATION BUT ALSO THEIR PHYSICAL. AND MENTAL WELL BEING AS WELL I COMMEND MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING FOR THIS MEASURE I STAND PROUDLY WITH HIM. AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN CENTER PAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATORS- I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SP EIGHT SIX SIX AS A PEDIATRICIAN AND A FATHER OF. WO CHILDREN ONE OF WHOM IS A TEENAGER AND ANOTHER ONE WHO WILL TURN TWELVE ACTUALLY- LATER THIS YEAR. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO ALLOW. YOUNG PEOPLE TO SELF CONSENT TO FTA. RECOMMENDED AND H. C. I. T. RECOMMENDED VACCINES AND AS A PEDIATRICIAN I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE. AND IT IS UP TO THIS LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW THEM TO DO SO NOW- CERTAINLY HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT- PARENTS IN FACT THIS IS A PHYSICIAN AND SOMEONE WHO PARTICULARLY FOCUSES ON TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN AND- ARE USED. OF COURSE WE ENGAGE PARENTS. BOYS FRIDAY'S APPEARANCE. BUT WE ALSO KNOWN FORTY THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH- AND IT IS TRULY UNFORTUNATE AS A PHYSICIAN WHO'S HAD TO DEAL WITH CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND SO FORTH THAT SOMETIMES- PARENTS ALWAYS ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN. BUT ACTUALLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY OFTENTIMES PARENTS ARE TRYING THEIR BEST. BUT THEY MAY BE FOR A CERTAIN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES THE MEDIA WAY RIGHT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS AND SO FORTH. THOSE BECOME BARRIERS TO THE USE GETTING CARE. SO WE TRIED IT WE CERTAINLY TRY TO ENGAGE THE PARENTS AND THE PARENTS READING GAUGE WITH US BUT SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A MIGRANT FAMILY AND THE PARENTS HAPPEN TO BE WORKING AND IT'S NOT A COUNTY YOUR FATHER WHERE THEY CAN'T GET THERE. AND MEANWHILE THEIR GRANDPARENTS OR MAYBE AN OLDER SIBLING OR AN UNCLE OR ONCE PRIMARILY TAKING CARE OF THEM BUT YET THEY DON'T HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY BECAUSE LISTEN NOW THEN GO TO COURT AND THAT IS BECAUSE THE PARENTS KNOW THE VENTS THE COMEBACK IN SERVICE. SO THESE BECOME BARRIERS TO CARE. AND ANSWER- I THINK WELL SOME. DO THIS BILL AS EXAMPLE MAYBE A YOUTH IN THE PARENT MAY DISAGREE. ACTUALLY IS A PEACHES ALL TELL YOU THE MORE COMMON CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT THE PARENT ACTUALLY AGREES. BUT THEY WERE YOU KNOW IT AGAIN THERE IS A MAYBE WORKING TWO JOBS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCOMPANY THE TOWN. IN FACT A SIMPLE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ACTUALLY TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WORK FOR THE PAIR AND THEY GOT THEIR FIRST VACCINE. IS MANY VACCINES ARE SERIES. AND THEN BECOME FOR FOLLOW UP VISIT BUT BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE TOO BUSY WITH THEIR JOBS OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PROPERTY LISTING OLDER SIBLING WHO HAPPENS TO BE YOU KNOW TWENTY BUT- DOES HAVE FOR THEIR GRANDPARENTS. AND THEN THE PROBLEM IS THE SHOP IN THE OFFICE AND I'VE SEEN THIS SO MANY TIMES. IT WAS LIKE SORRY WE CAN'T DO THIS. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE PARENTS HERE TO GIVE DIRECT PERMISSION AND WE TRY TO REACH THE PAIR BUT THEY'RE WORKING. THEY DON'T HAVE THE L. L. SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY'RE AT. WE KNOW CERTAINLY NO WORKERS WHERE DID ALLOWED TO KEEP CELL PHONES NEXT TO THEM ETCETERA. AND WE CAN'T REACH A GO SORRY AND MEANWHILE THE FAMILY CERTAINLY TOOK- TREMENDOUS EFFORTS TO BE SURE THEIR CHILD BECOMING DAY CARE AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT HASN'T. I WOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT WHILE CERTAINLY IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALLOWING. TEENS USE. THE SELF CONSENT. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO GET THE SERVICES. THERE'S ACTUALLY A LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO DELIVER IT AND HAS EXERCISED THEIR OWN PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THAT YOU. AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER LAYER OF PROTECTION. TO ENSURE THAT- THAT CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THAT THE USER CAN DECIDE I WANT ANYTHING I WANT. THERE'S ACTUALLY. A YEAH THE A LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL SAYS THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU. AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL IS PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON GETTING VACCINES WHICH HAVE GONE THROUGH THE MOST RIGOROUS TESTING AND HAS A REQUIRES APPROVAL. AND RECOMMENDATION FROM EXPERTS LIKE ADVISING TO ME IN HIS ASIAN PRACTICES. AND THAT'S WHY BY THE WAY IN ADDITION TO BUT THIS BILL ADDRESSES JUST VACCINATIONS THAT ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA LAW. IN CALIFORNIA LAW. IF A TWELVE YEAR OLD SHOWS UP IN MY OFFICE. AND NOT ONLY DID THEY WANT OTHER VACCINES LIKE HPV AND HEPATITIS B. THEY CAN CONSENT TO IT. THEY WANNA TALK TO ME ABOUT THE NASTY D. DRUG USE- PREGNANCY. SEXUAL ASSAULT. I DON'T NEED TO GO ASK THE PARENTS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE USED TO GET THE CARE AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE PRIVACY NECESSARY TO DO THAT. BUT I ALSO INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THINKING ABOUT ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WERE STRUGGLING WITH RIGHT NOW. IN A FORTY THE STIGMA ATTACHED TO THAT. SO THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT. REDUCING THE BARRIERS TO GETTING LIFESAVING VACCINES AND CERTAINLY THERE'S NO MEDICAL OR SCIENCE BASED REASON WHY MINERS FORMER OLDER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONSENT TO THEM AGAIN AS A PEDIATRICIAN WHO STUDIES CHILD DEVELOPMENT THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT A TWELVE YEAR OLD. BY LAW SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONSENT TO THEM AND CERTAINLY AGAIN WITH A LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IS EVALUATING THEIR STATE OF MIND AND THEIR CONDITION. I'LL POINT OUT THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE OPPOSE THE TWO TEENS CHEESE VACCINES ACT ALSO OPPOSE ABORTION ACCESS. IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MUST HOLD THE LINE AGAINST FIGHTING AGAINST AGENCY FOR WOMEN YOUNG PEOPLE. FOR THAT REASON THE ASIAN CENTER VACCINES MUST BE TWELVE WHICH IS WHAT IT CURRENTLY IS NOW. WE DO NOT KNOW ACCESS WITH AN OSCAR IF WOULD BE IF WE START MAKING DECISIONS FOR POLITICAL REASONS AND NOT SCIENTIFIC ONES. SO THIS REALLY IS ABOUT MAKING IT EASIER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GIVE VACCINES IT SHOULD BE A GOOD THING. AND WE ALSO WANT TO INCREASE HEALTHCARE EQUITY BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S USUALLY THE FAMILIES THAT ARE MOST DISADVANTAGED OF THE LARGEST BARRIERS TO GETTING VACCINATIONS INCLUDING BY THE WAY GETTING CAN. THIS- CONSENT SO WHAT IS TIME OFF WORK FOR A WELLNESS VISIT OUR FORGOTTEN PAPERWORK. ANY CHANGE THAT MAKES IT EASIER TO GIVE ACTUALLY IS THE ONE WE MUST TAKE. AND WE OF COURSE KNOW HOW FOR VACCINATIONS ARE TOO NOR PROTECTING THE CHILD'S HEALTH BE SURE THAT THEY CAN GO TO. THAT THE AMOUNTS IN A HOSPITAL. HIGH RISK FAMILY MEMBERS RIGHT I MEAN. TRANSACTION OFTEN UNTIL WE GETS A PARTICULAR PEOPLE YOUR FAMILY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE WE HAVE APPROPRIATE ACCESS. TO LIFESAVING PREVENTION FOR CHILDREN. AND WHAT THAT THAT'S WHY NOT ONLY OF COURSE. AM I SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF IT MY COLLEAGUES IN MY PROFESSION ARE SO YOU DON'T LISTEN TO THIS ONE PEDIATRICIAN HERE TO HAVE THIS BE AMONG YOU. THE PEDIATRICIANS OF CALIFORNIA STANFORD S. PROGRESS THE BOARD. YOUNG PEOPLE WANT THIS. YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WATER BOARD PROVIDERS THIS SB A SUCCESS AUTHORS AUTHORIZES BALI ECONOMY THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF CAPABLE OF THE TEENS USE AXES ACT AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT WE NEED TO REDUCE THE BARRIER VACCINATIONS I STRICTLY ASPEN EITHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB TODAY I MIGHT ADD. OUR COLLEAGUES. THIS IS CERTAINLY A DIFFICULT ISSUE- BUT IF WE WERE TO GO BACK IN TIME WHEN WE WERE GOING TO THE FIRST YEAR OF COATED- IN CERTAINLY INTO THE SECOND WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN TERMS OF AXING POLICY. I CONSULTED WITH MY FAMILY DOCTOR AND CONSULT WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS. AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT VACCINES WERE THE BEST PATH FORWARD FOR ME AND MY FAMILY IN SPECIFICALLY MY TWO YOUNG BOYS AGE TEN AND EIGHT. THIS BILL. I BELIEVE THAT WORK IS GOING TO HAVE MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THE FIRST OF WHICH WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PARENT AND WHAT IS THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD BEFORE THAT YOU CAN BE TWELVE YEARS OLD TO GET CERTAIN- MEDICAL TREATMENT WE'LL HAVE TO BE A DIFFERENT AGE TO VOTE OR SERVE IN THE MILITARY AND YET ANOTHER AGE TO BUY TO BUY ALCOHOL OR SMOKE CIGARETTES. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY ONE IS THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE WE WANT. AND WHICH ONES MOST APPLICABLE. BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HEARD IN JUDICIARY PEOPLE CALL IN WE ALSO HEARD FROM OUR STEAM TO- PHYSICIAN ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THIS BODY. THAT THIS IS GOING TO MAKE LIFE EASIER BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THESE INDIVIDUALS THESE CHILDREN CAN'T GET PARENTAL PERMISSION BECAUSE MAYBE THE PARENTS WORK OUTSIDE THE AREA WHERE THEY'RE BUSY OR TO SINGLE MOM WORKING TWO JOBS. THAT ENTIRE SCENARIO CAN BE RESOLVED ADMINISTRATIVELY. BY HAVING A SIGN OFF PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES THE PAIR TO STILL MAKE THE DECISION IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND THE CHILD BE BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE VACCINE. SO LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES THAT BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE. PARENTAL CONSENT CAN BE GIVEN AND THEY CAN BE EXPEDITED IN ADMINISTRATIVE FASHION BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD US TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT. I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT- THIS ISSUE IS ABOUT FOLLOWING. EXISTING LEGISLATION IT'S HARD NOT TO IMAGINE THAT EXISTING LEGISLATION WASN'T DELIBERATELY PUT INTO INTO A FACT FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF OPENING THE DOOR FOR SUBSEQUENTLY LEGISLATION. SO I HAVE I HAVE AN ABSOLUTE HORROR TIME. TRYING TO RECONCILE THIS BECAUSE IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH I IMAGINE A YEAR FROM NOW OR TWO YEARS FROM NOW. THIS SAME ISSUE OF TWELVE YEAR OLD CONSENT WILL SOMEHOW FIND ITS WAY INTO CLINICAL TRIALS. RIGHT NOW IT HAS TO BE FTA APPROVED. BUT IN TWO YEARS FROM NOW. IT'S ONLY A MATTER TIME BEFORE CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICAL POWERS IN INTEREST WANTING TO- TO BUILD UP A BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP IN A CERTAIN AREA ARE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THE CLINICAL TRIALS CAN BE ACHIEVED. BY THE CONSENTING PRINCIPAL WHO HAPPENS TO BE TWELVE YEARS OLD. AS A PARENT. THIS IS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO ME. N. AS A PARENT WHO BELIEVES THAT VACCINES. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT PATH FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE MAJORITY OF WHAT. YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN CALL INS AND COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THIS CAN BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY. I DON'T THINK WE SPEND ENOUGH TIME ON ON ON THAT ON THAT ISSUE. AND SO. I GUESS. I GUESS I WILL CONCLUDE WITH THIS COLLEAGUES THAT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PARENTS OR HAVE LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP OVER CHILDREN YOU HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES. YOU ARE EXPECTED TO OVERSEE AND TAKE AGENCY OF THAT MINOR. THIS LAW IN THE ENTIRE CADRE OF ASSOCIATED LAWS THAT ARE MAKING LEGAL CONSENT THE H. TWELVE IS DOING AWAY WITH ALL OF THAT. SO AS A PARENT YOU HAVE FULL LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY BUT YOU HAVE NO PARENTAL AUTHORITY. THIS IS A DANGEROUS PATH FORWARD IN AS PARENTS OR THOSE WHO ARE GRANDPARENTS IN THIS ROOM I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK UPON THIS ON ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WILL MEAN TODAY BUT TOMORROW AND IN. THE YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU SIR BARGES SENATOR MELENDEZ. I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES IN GERMAN I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL- I YOU KNOW THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE THAT- THAT THERE IS NO MEDICAL REASON FOR THIS NOT TO BE LAW AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY DISAGREE- JOHN HOPKINS SINCE APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAVE REPORTED THERE BEEN MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND CASES OF MYOCARDITIS AND PERICARDITIS CHILDREN HAPPENING AFTER THE BACKS NATION I WOULD SAY. THAT'S A VERY GOOD MEDICAL REASON- NOT TO MENTION THE MEDICAL REASON FOR WHEN A CHILD MIGHT HAVE SOME UNDERLYING MEDICAL ISSUE OR PERHAPS TAKING SOME OTHER MEDICATION THAT MIGHT- CAUSE AN ADVERSE EFFECT AFTER GETTING A PARTICULAR VACCINATION AND THAT MINOR CHILD NOT TELLING THE PERSON MINISTERING THE VACCINE IF THEY'RE TAKING THAT MEDICATION OR THAT THEY HAVE THAT FAMILY HISTORY OR THAT THEY HAVE THAT PARTICULAR MEDICAL CONDITION. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A TWELVE YEAR OLD I MEAN. YOU KNOW MANY OF YOU IN HERE HAVE KIDS SOME OF YOU STILL HAVE KIDS IN THE HOME LIKE I DO AND YOU KNOW THE KIDS THAT YOUNG I HAD DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING A LOT OF THINGS LET ALONE ANY PARTICULAR MEDICATION OR MEDICAL- ILLNESS YOU KNOW THAT THEY MAY HAVE THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DIVULGE. TO THE PERSON ADMINISTERING THE VACCINES. NOT TO MENTION IF THIS MINOR CHILD GOES AND GETS THIS VACCINATION. AND DOESN'T TELL THEIR PARENTS HOW IN THE WORLD AS A PARENT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETHING IS GOING WRONG AFTER GETTING THAT BACKS THE NATION HOW WOULD A PARENT KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT IT IS CAUSED BY AND THEN KNOW HOW TO SEEK THE PROPER MEDICAL CARE PARTICULARLY IF AS MANY HAVE POINTED OUT THERE ARE PARENTS WHO ARE JUST TOO BUSY. TO TAKE THEIR KIDS TO GET NEEDED WILL OF THE PAYMENTS ARE BUSY AND WORKING AND NOT THERE TO SEE THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF ADVERSE REACTION. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO HELP THEM IF THE PARENTS DON'T KNOW THAT THE CHILD GOT THE VACCINATION. HOW WOULD THEY KNOW TO EVEN KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR IT TO WATCH FOR IT. THEY ARE AT THEIR SECOND JOB MAYBE PERHAPS TELL AN OLDER SIBLING OR THEIR CARETAKER. HEY KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ANY ANY OF THESE SORTS OF SYMPTOMS IN MY CHILD THEY WOULDN'T KNOW THAT. THEY WOULDN'T KNOW THAT. AND I THINK THAT IS UNFAIR. AND UNREASONABLE. TO DO TO A CHILD OR TO ANY PARENT OUT THERE HE JUST WANTS TO KEEP THEIR CHILD SAFE. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY BELIEVE IN ANY PARTICULAR VACCINE BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BEING ABOUT THE COVERT VACCINE BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T RELATE ONLY TO THE KOBE VACCINE ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT'S LARGELY WHAT HAS DOMINATED PEOPLE'S MINDS. THIS POINT. I'M THE OTHER ISSUE WITH THIS BILL IS I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT IT'S- LEGAL. D. NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT STATES EACH HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WHO ADMINISTERED- ADMINISTERS A VACCINE SET FORTH IN THE VACCINE INJURY TABLE SHALL PROVIDE TO THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY CHILD OR TO ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL TO HIM SUCH. VAIDER INTENDS TO ADMINISTER SUCH FAXING A COPY OF THE VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTED WITH VISUAL PRESENTATIONS ARE ORAL EXPLANATIONS IN APPROPRIATE CASES AND IT HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED PRIOR TO GIVING THE VACCINE. SO IF YOU GIVE. A MINOR THIS. VACCINATION AND YOU HAND THEM THE BOOKLET OF ALL THE DIFFERENT ADVERSE REACTIONS THAT MAY TAKE PLACE. DO YOU TRUST THAT THAT MINOR WILL REDUCE. DO YOU TRUST THAT THAT MINOR WILL GIVE IT TO AN ADULT IN THEIR LIFE WHO MAY BE WATCHING OVER THEM THAT THEY WILL GIVE IT TO THEM. PROBABLY NOT. PARTICULARLY IF THEIR PARENTS ARE THERE ARE THEIR HEALTH OR THEIR THEIR PROVIDER THEIR YOU KNOW WHOEVER'STAKING CARE OF THEM. DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE GETTING IT YOUR THIS PUTS CHILDREN AT RISK BY NOW. THERE ARE. PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD GET THIS VACCINE WEATHERS THE COVERT VACCINE OR ANY OTHER. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I THINK YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION WHICH IS THIS COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE. VERY SERIOUS HARM TO CHILDREN THERE IS A REASON THAT THERE IS A DATABASE THAT TRACKS ADVERSE REACTIONS TO VACCINATIONS NOT JUST THE KOBE BAXEEN BUT ALL VACCINATIONS THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT THERE'S A REASON THERE IS A FUND HAS BEEN SET UP. THAT HAS PAID OUT NEARLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. TO THOSE HAVE BEEN INJURED OR- DIED. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE VACCINE ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. WHY IS THAT BECAUSE THESE THINGS DO HAPPEN. LARGELY VACCINATIONS ARE ADMINISTERED IN THERE ARE NO SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS BUT GUESS WHAT THERE MANY OTHER INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE SO I AM ASKING YOU. TO PLEASE CONSIDER THE HEALTH OF THESE CHILDREN PLEASE CONSIDER THAT YOU ARE PUTTING PARENTS IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE NO IDEA THAT THEIR CHILD MIGHT BE HAVING SOME SORT OF REACTION TO THIS VACCINE AND HAVE NO ABILITY TO HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT'S GOING ON. I URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU SIR MELENDEZ CENTER OTOBO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. TAKING A FULL BREATH BECAUSE I WANT MY ADRENALINE TO COME DOWN MY HEART'S BEATING SO FAST RIGHT NOW. AND I WE HAD SOME NOTES BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I WOULD GET REALLY RILED UP IN I WANT TO BE FRONTAL LOBE THINKING AND NOT PRIMAL IN MY BRAIN OF TRYING TO EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS THIS MORNING TO MY COLLEAGUES. WHO I. WHOLEHEARTEDLY RESPECT. WHILE I BELIEVE THAT AXES ARE AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL THAT WE HAVE. AND ENCOURAGE ALL TO CONSULT WITH THEIR DOCTORS AND CONSIDER GETTING VACCINATED. I RISE TODAY IS APPARENT WITH STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS MEASURE. THIS BILL WOULD EMPOWER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF CHILDREN TO CONSENT TO MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT THEY LIKELY KNOW LITTLE ABOUT WITHOUT THE GUIDANCE OR KNOWLEDGE OF A CARE GIVER OR PARENTS. AT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE I TELL THE BRAIN IS STILL FORMING AND THEIR REASONING SKILLS ARE NOT ALWAYS FULLY DEVELOPED. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT. A MINOR. IS ANY PERSON BELOW THE AGE OF ADULTHOOD WHO IS STILL LEGALLY UNDER THE AUTHORITY AND SUPERVISION OF THEIR PARENTS. DO WE HEAR THAT A MINOR. LEGAL DEFINITION. AN EMANCIPATED MINOR IS ONE WHO HAS PROVEN TO THE COURT THAT THEY ARE MATURE ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. OWN DECISIONS MANAGE THEIR FINANCES AND THAT EMANCIPATION IS THE BEST PATH FOR THEM. PARENTS AND GUARDIANS KNOW THEIR CHILDREN BEST. WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO FURNISH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHILD'S MEDICAL HISTORY. RYER ALLERGIC REACTIONS AND OVERALL WILL BE. PERSONALLY I DO KNOW IS ARE ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN BECAUSE OF THAT REACTION THAT HAS A BABY. UNTIL MY MOM TOLD ME LATER ON AS AN ADULT. PARENTS ARE ALSO REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO BE PROVIDED WITH SIGNIFICANT PAPERWORK REGARDING SIDE EFFECTS TO EACH VACCINE. HOW TO DETECT SIGNS OF ADVERSE REACTION IN CHILDREN ANY EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS. UNDER THIS BILL IF A MINOR CHILD CONSENTS TO VACCINATION WITHOUT PARENTAL KNOWLEDGE AND HAVE A REACTION THE PARENT MAY NOT RECOGNIZE THE VACCINE REACTION SYMPTOMS WHICH CAN PUT THE CHILD AT FURTHER RISK. ALL OF THESE REASONS WHY VACCINE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BETWEEN PARENTS. CHILDREN AND A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THIS BILL IS ONE OF MANY THAT WE HAVE SEEN SEEKING TO REMOVE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF. THANKS. AS A STRONG BELIEVER IN THE POWER OF THE FAMILY UNIT. I URGE ALL OF US TO CONSIDER THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THE DECISIONS WE MAKE HERE. AS WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS THAT EMPOWER HEALTHY FAMILIES TO MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEST FOR THEIR FAMILIES OR WE ARE MANDATING FROM THE TOP DOWN WHAT WE THINK IS BEST. I'M GOING TO GO STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW AND I'M GOING OFF THE HEART RIGHT NOW. I'VE BEEN HERE ONLY. A YEAR AND A HALF. NOT VERY LONG. BUT I'VE SEEN AND I'VE BEEN LISTENING CAREFULLY TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN STATING HERE. WHAT MOTIVATES YOUR BILLS WHAT MORE WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART AND SOMETIMES WHAT MOTIVATES YOUR BILLS. SOMETIMES WE GET MYOPIC WITH TICKET WE FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR BUILT ON THE MERITS OF THAT BILL. AND I CAN SEE THAT SOMETIMES WE VOTE BECAUSE IT SOUNDS WARM AND FUZZY IT'S SOMETHING THAT OKAY IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD. BUT HERE'S THE THING COLLEAGUES. COMING FROM OUT THERE AND TO HEAR. SOMETIMES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE. HAVE AN IMPACT THAT DOESN'T COME RIGHT AWAY BECOMES TEN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS FROM NOW. AND WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT. I HEARD ONCE FOR ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE CAN'T LEGISLATE VALUES. BUT LET ME REASSURE YOU THAT WHAT WE LEGISLATIVE BECOMES OUR VALUES OR A REFLECTION OF THE VALUES THAT SOME OF US HAVE. A VOTE TODAY ON THIS BILL. IS NOT DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT ME JUST CLARIFY A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPLICATE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE IN VACCINATION. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF COST BECAUSE IT'S READILY ACCESSIBLE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. FOR ANYONE TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. BUT A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY THE PARENT FUNDAMENTALLY OR THE CARE GIVER FUNDAMENTALLY. HAS THE ABILITY TO SEEK THE RESOURCES. AND MAKE DECISIONS THAT IS BEST FOR THEIR CHILD IN THEIR FAMILY. WE ARE EMPOWERING THEM NOT DISENFRANCHISES IN A PARENT OR A FAMILY. THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF ANY SOCIETY FAMILIES ARE FUNDAMENTAL. TO A HEALTHY COMMUNITY HEALTHY SOCIETY HELP THE STATE AND HELP THE COUNTRY. WE KNOW THAT. BUT WE PASSED LEGISLATION WHAT WE TAKE AWAY THE PARENTS ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR CHILD'S UPBRINGING. WELL BEING. WHAT VALUES ARE YOU PROMOTING AND CONVEY. THAT'S WHAT I KNOW BOARD OR A YES VOTE WOULD MEAN ON THIS ARE NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE. TO EVERYONE AND ANYONE WHO CHOOSES TO HELP THEM. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION. IS THAT MOVING FORWARD. THE NOTION OF A PRECEDENCE BECAUSE WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE REFINERS COULD GET A VACCINE. DOZEN MAKES IT SO THAT THIS IS OKAY. THAT JUST MAKES IT THAT WERE FURTHERING FOR THE STRIPPING AWAY CHIPPING AWAY. AT A PARENT'S RESPONSIBILITY AND ABILITY TO PAY. I HATE TO SAY THIS. BUT GOVERNMENT. CAN ONLY PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE TO PURSUE LIFE LIBERTY AND HAPPINESS. WHEN WE START OVER REACHING AND MANDATING. AND TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO YOU. COLLEAGUES LET'S RETHINK FOR WE'RE GOING. WHERE ARE HER VALUES PUSHING US TO THE POINT WHERE WE SAY PARENTS ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY. JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. THE SACRAMENTO BEE HAD AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE READING SCORES OF CALIFORNIA. BEING AT THE VERY BOTTOM ACROSS THE STATE. IN COMPARISON TO ACROSS THE STATE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT THEY HAD ON THAT ARTICLE WHAT WOULD MAKE AN IMPACT IN A DIFFERENCE AND NOT. PERRANCE ENGAGEMENT. PARENT ENGAGEMENT WOULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN OUR READING SCORES. SO SEE AS A BODY TODAY. WELL WE EMPOWER PARENTS WITH RESOURCES AND THE ABILITY THE AUTONOMY TO MAKE DECISIONS AND BRING HARMONY TO THAT FAMILY AWAY. COLLEAGUES. B. VISIONARIES YOUR LEGISLATION BEING VISIONARY IN THE WAY THAT YOUR VALUES WILL BE MANIFESTED BASED ON LEGISLATION MOVING FORWARD TWENTY THIRTY AND FORTY YEARS FROM NOW. ONCE AGAIN. I KNOW VOTE TODAY DOES NOT MEAN YOUR ENTIRE BACKSEAT IT JUST MEANS THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT. PARENT INVOLVEMENT AND ENGAGEMENT IS CRUCIAL IN MAKING AN IMPACT IN A DIFFERENCE IN A CHILD'S LIFE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOTE. THANK YOU CENTER OCHO BOGUS SENATOR COM LONGER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YOU KNOW I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO RAISE MY MICROPHONE ON THIS BILL I WASN'T EVEN EXPECTING IT TO COME UP- BUT I'VE BEEN LISTENING. TWO THE COMMENTS ON THE FLOOR. AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THEM. AS A PARENT AND LISTENING TO ALL OF THE ONES WHO HAVE RAISED THEIR MICROPHONE OR WHO HAVE SHARED- YOU KNOW THEIR THOUGHTS ON THIS LEGISLATION AND WHERE WE ARE IN THIS TIME AS A PARENT OR AS A GUARDIAN. AND I'M GOING TO JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU YOU KNOW AS A PARENT. I WANT TO HAVE TOTAL CONTROL. OVER EVERYTHING IN MY HOUSEHOLD. INCLUDING MY CHILDREN. I WANT THEM TO ASK ME ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS I WANT TO BE THE ONE GIVING THEM ALL OF THE ANSWERS I WANT ALL OF THE ANSWERS TO BE CORRECT AND WHEN THEY ARE NOT I WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO BACK AND FIND THE RIGHT ANSWER AND COME BACK. AND GIVE IT TO THEM. THAT IS A FANTASY. THAT IS A FANTASY. I HAVE NOT BEEN THINKING ABOUT VACCINES IN THE CONTEXT OF EIGHT SIX SIX I HAVE TO TELL YOU. AND I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT OTHER PARENTS LIKE ME. WHO HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR CHILDREN AT HEART. I AM THINKING ABOUT OTHER PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OUT THERE WHO DO NOT. WHO ARE ABSENT WHO ARE NEGLECTFUL WHO ARE ABUSIVE WHO ARE HARMFUL. IN FACT I WAS THINKING ABOUT. THE PARENT ARRESTED THIS WEEK FOR KILLING HER CHILDREN. I WAS THINKING ABOUT PARENTS WHO ARE ANTI GAY WHO HAVE A CHILD WHO IS L. G. B. T. Q. I. A. AND HOW THEY PUNISH. THEM FOR BEING GAY REFUSE TO SHARE INFORMATION OR ACCESS TO RESOURCES OR SUPPORT OR TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY EXIST. NONE OF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH VACCINES FOR SURE. BUT IT DOES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PARENTS. OUT THERE US FAIL. MANY OF US FAIL WITH REALLY GREAT INTENTIONS AT HEART NOT. LOOKING OUT FOR THE WELL BEING OF THE CHILDREN IN THEIR LIVES. I COMPLETELY AGREE PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND LEGAL AUTHORITY. THERE SHOULD BE GREATER CONNECTIVITY BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU SO MANY EXAMPLES OF WHY I FEEL LIKE HOW AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THIS AND THE CHALLENGES WANTS TO DO THE WHOLE THING BUT MAYBE I'M JUST CAUGHT UP IN THE MADNESS OF HAVING A TEENAGER AT HOME. BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEGISLATE SAFETY. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT ALL KINDS OF PARENTS. THAT ARE OUT HERE. AND SOME REALLY DO NEED LEGISLATIVE CIRCUMVENTION LIKE THIS I'LL REPHRASE THAT THE PARENTS MIGHT NOT NEED IT BUT THE CHILDREN DESERVE IT BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU THIS YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW. WHEN THEY ARE IN TROUBLE THEY KNOW WHEN THEY ARE IN HARM'S WAY THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE WITH A PARENT OR GUARDIAN THAT IS NOT LOVING THEM. AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT WE- NO THEY SHOULD HAVE TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THROUGH THEIR YOUNG LIFE SAFELY. AND WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING ACCESS TO MEDICINE THAT WILL KEEP YOU SAFE JUST LIKE IT WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT WILL KEEP YOU ALIVE THAT WILL PROTECT YOU WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TALK ABOUT THOSE INSTANCES AND FIND A WAY TO CREATE POLICY THAT WILL HELP THOSE CHILDREN. SO I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT EIGHT SIX SIX IN THE CONTEXT OF MY FAMILY THE TABLE FOR HONEST UNCOMFORTABLE OPEN DISCUSSIONS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A PATH WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY IS ON BOARD. I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THOSE FAMILIES I'M THINKING ABOUT THOSE FAMILIES WHERE CHILDREN ARE AT RISK AND THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN THAT SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR THEM IS NOT. IS INTENTIONALLY NOT. AND HOW DO WE HELP THEM. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHT SIX AND- THANK YOU CENTER COME LONGER SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO BE RECOGNIZED SENATOR WIENER YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR- THE DEBATE I'D APPRECIATE IT I DO JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING WITH ALL RESPECT. THIS ISN'T THIS IS NOT A WARM AND FUZZY BILL. WE HAVE BILLS ON THIS FLOOR WE COOPER MY NAME A FEW. NUMBER YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL PROBABLY AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER AUTHORED A BILL. THAT IS WARM AND FUZZY THAT IS JUST LIKE A FEEL GOOD. BILL YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD BILL BUT IS NOT GOING TO LIKE YOU KNOW. CHANGE THE WORLD. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE BILLS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A TEENAGER. WHO IS EITHER BEING BLOCKED BY THEIR PARENT FROM PROTECTING THEIR HEALTH. OR IS BEING NEGLECTED OR ABUSED AND CAN PROTECT THEIR HEALTH. WHEN A TEENAGER IS SIMPLY SAYING. I HAVE I'M A TEENAGER WHO'S IMMUNO COMPROMISED AND DOESN'T WANT TO END UP ON A VENTILATOR. A TEENAGER WHO DOESN'T WANT TO GET THE MONTHS AND BECOME STERILE. PARENTS OFTEN BECOME STERILE THE KIDS GOING TO BE STERILE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. A KID WHO GOD FOR BID POLIO COMES BACK TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE AS I MET IT IS CIRCULATING IN THE WORLD. IF POLIO COMES BACK. WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE PARA PARALYZED. BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON YOUTUBE OR FOX NEWS GETTING VACCINATED. IT'S ABOUT THOSE KIDS BEING ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HEALTH. WE'VE HEARD SOME PARADES OF HORRIBLE'S TODAY ABOUT FDA CLINICAL TRIALS WHICH ISN'T EVEN A QUESTION OF STATE LAW THAT FEDERAL LAW WE'VE HEARD ABOUT MACRO DATA SAID SIDE EFFECTS. BUT WE HAVE THAT OTHER PARADE OF HORRIBLE'S ABOUT KIDS ACTUALLY GETTING SICK AND DYING NOT SYSTEM CODED BUT OTHER DISEASES THAT ARE 1100% PER PERCENT PREVENTABLE. BUT FOR THE PARENT NOT ALLOWING THE KID TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HEALTH HISTORY BUT NO KID KNOWS OUR HEALTH HISTORY A LOT OF KIDS DO KNOW THEIR HEALTH HISTORY AND THEY KNOW WHAT THE HELL'S THERE TAKING AND DOCTORS OR PHARMACISTS OR OTHER HEALH CARE PROFESSIONALS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH INTENSIVE TRAINING KNOWING WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK WHAT WARNING SIGNS TO LOOK FOR. AND HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS ON WHO CAN GIVE INFORMED CONSENT. THESE ARE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. NOT JUST RANDOM PEOPLE. THANK HIGHS I DISMISSED SAY OF COURSE WE WANT PARENTS TO BE INVOLVED IN THEIR KIDS HEALTH CARE. ABSOLUTELY WE WANT PARENTS TO BE INVOLVED. OF COURSE WE WANT KIDS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING TO THEIR PARENTS ABOUT VACCINATION- OR HUNDREDS OF OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES IN LIFE WE ABSOLUTELY WANT THAT. BUT AS A SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES VERY ELOQUENTLY STATED. THAT'S NOT THE REALITY OF THE WORLD. FOR EVERY CHILD. AND THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY CHILDREN WHO CAN'T TALK TO THEIR PARENTS FOR WHATEVER REASON. WHERE THEY FEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABUSED AND THEY TALK TO THEIR PARENTS ABOUT IT. WHETHER PARENTS JUST WON'T LISTEN TO THEM. AND FOR THOSE KIDS. THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HEALTH THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND THAT'S ALL. THAT IT'S ABOUT. FOR VACCINES THAT THE FDA HAS DETERMINED. ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. I'M AT THE CDC HAS DETERMINED AS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS AGE GROUP I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AIBO.

DESPITE THEIR DEEP INVOLVEMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND A LOT OF THEIR PERSONAL FINANCIAL INVESTMENT FROM BUYING SHOES AND CLOTHING AND BOOKS AND MAKING SURE THAT SOMETIMES OUR FAD. AS I'VE DONE MYSELF IN THE PAST SOMETIMES I BELIEVE THEY DON'T GET THE RECOGNITION THEY DESERVE. WE ALLOW THEM TO EDUCATE OUR MOST PRECIOUS LITTLE HUMANS. AND THEY PLAY SO MANY DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE CLASSROOM THAT ARE NOT IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION THEIR COUNSELORS THERE PERRANCE. ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE BEST FRIENDS AND AGAIN THEY INVEST SO MUCH OF THEIR PERSONAL TIME. AND EFFORT IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE WELL ROUNDED. LITTLE CHILDREN.

CENTER LAYERED YOU'RE RECOGNIZED IN SUPPORT OF THIS AS NOT JUST SOMEONE WHO WAS MOVED BY TEACHERS BUT SOMEONE WHO IS THE SON OF TWO TEACHERS WHO HAD FIFTY YEARS BETWEEN THEM AND EDUCATION. AND I HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE IT TOO ONE IS A SINCE I'VE BEEN IN SACRAMENTO THREE TIMES SOMEBODY HAS WALKED UP TO ME. AND SAID TO YOUR DAD REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE THERE WAS SOMEBODY THAT HE TAUGHT TO SWIM. THERE WAS SOMEBODY THAT HE ACTUALLY GOT A BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP AND CAME TO SACRAMENTO AND LATER BECAME A CABINET SECRETARY IRONICALLY. AND VERY WELCOMING- THAT JUST HE MADE A DIFFERENCE DAY TO DAY IN THEIR LIFE. AND A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS IN- THE SENATOR FROM NAPA'S DISTRICT IN MY HOME TOWN. GOING TO A HIGH SCHOOL REUNION AND I WENT AND I WAS GOING TO HELP THEM SET UP IN THE ROOM. AND THEY SAID WE CAN'T DO IT THE PREVIOUS GROUP IS IN THERE THEY'RE NOT OUT YET AND I SAID WHO ARE THERE AND THEY'RE THE PEOPLE. THAT GRADUATED FROM JOHN SWETT HIGH SCHOOL IN CROCKETT BETWEEN NINETEEN FIFTY TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EXACTLY. THE GROUP WHEN MY FATHER HAD BEEN A TEACHER A COACH AND A PRINCIPAL. SO BEING AT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL I JUST BARGED IN THIS GROUP UNINVITED. AND BECAME A CELEBRITY- IT BECAUSE MY DAD WALKED SOMEBODY OUT OF A ROOM WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT TO FAIL A TEST AND GAVE HER A PEP TALK AND SHE CAME BACK IN AND- PASS THE CLASS. HIKVISION I JUST HAD STORY AFTER STORY LIKE THAT THERE WAS EVEN SOMEBODY THAT WAS IN THE CLASS OF THAT CABINET SECRETARIES AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW HE REALLY MENTORED THAT GUY THAT BECAME A CABINET SECRETARY BEING A CABINET SECRETARY IS A BIG DEAL. AND I SAID WELL I KNOW BUT I DIDN'T TELL HIM WHAT I DID FOR A LIVING AT THE TIME BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS I WAS ROUGHLY IT'S KID AND I WAS ENJOYING THE FACT THAT HE MADE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AS A TEACHER SO. WE HONOR TEACHERS OF THEY DO. DIDN'T ALLOW. OF BOTCH.

YOU KNOW WHAT BY% DEFINITION TEACHERS TEACH AND CERTAINLY EDUCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO KNOW FOR YOU. HAVING AN ADULT FIGURE IN THEIR LIFE WHO CARES ABOUT THEM SO VERY IMPORTANT AND WELL CERTAINLY- IN MOST CASES THAT IS THEIR PARENTS. OFF IT ALSO BECOMES OUR TEACHERS AS WELL. AND TEACHERS SO TEACHERS PLAY A ROLE BEYOND JUST SIMPLY EDUCATING OUR YOUTH THEY ARE ALSO ROLE MODELS THEY ARE ALSO MENTORS- THERE GUY THEIR GUY FOR USE. AND WE NEED TO RESPECT THAT ROLE AS WELL ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE WATCHING LEGISLATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY CONSTRAINING TEACHERS FROM BEING ABLE TO SERVE IN THOSE ROLES PARTICULARLY FOR YOUTH. WHO WHO WHO WHO ARE MORE DISADVANTAGED TO MAYBE LGBT Q. AT SARAH THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE SURE WE- BOTH RECOGNIZE HONOR SEIZURES BUT ALSO.
