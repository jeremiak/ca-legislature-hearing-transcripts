WITH THE CURRENT VIRUS CITIES AND- ARE GOING TO FACE DISASTROUS BUDGET DEFICITS IN THE COMING YEARS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE STATE TAKES ACTION TO ENSURE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAINTAIN EVERY REVENUE SOURCE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN FORTY ONE DOES JUST THAT BY REMOVING THE SUNSET CLAUSE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO COLLECT UTILITY USER TAXES. FROM THE REAL SHOOTING FROM THE RETAIL SALES ARE PREPAID WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION PRODUCTS. SUCH AS PHONE SERVICES YOU CAN PURCHASE WITH PRE LOADED MINUTES. PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAD NO WAIT FOR COLLECTING LOCAL UTILITY USER TAXES ON PREPAID WIRELESS. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN ESTABLISHED A COLLECTION MECHANISM SIMILAR TO SALES TAX WHERE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION COLLECTS LOCALLY IMPOSED UTILITY USER TAXES FROM RETAIL SALES AND DISTRIBUTES THOSE REVENUES TO THE CITY OR COUNTY. WHERE THE PURCHASED TOOK PLACE. THERE ARE CURRENTLY ONE HUNDRED AND ONE CITIES AND THREE COUNTIES WHO COLLECT UTILITY USER TAXES ON PREPAID WIRELESS. WHICH I RECEIVEDAPPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW REVENUES SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS ENACTED. THIS MEASURE ONLY APPLIES TO LOCALLY IMPOSED VOTER APPROVED UTILITY USER TAX IS NOT THE STATE SURCHARGE PROVISIONS OF AB SEVEN SEVENTEEN. THAT WERE OVERTURNED BY THE- WITHOUT SB FOURTEEN FORTY ONE CITIES AND COUNTIES EXPERIENCING SHRINKING BUDGETS. WE'LL HAVE REVENUES REDUCED EVEN MORE FORCING LOCALS TO MAKE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO CUT CRITICAL SERVICES. THIS FORM OF LOCALIZED TAXATION HAS WORK EFFECTIVELY FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS BEEN EASILY AUDIBLE THUS WARRANTING AN ELIMINATION OF THE SUNSET PROVISION.

SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT. THE CITY OF SAN JOSE- IS REQUESTING APPROVAL THIS BILL. THE BILL IS IT A- A WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FROM THE OPEN SPACE FOR PARTY. BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION.

THAT IS NOT REALLY LOOKING TO DOWN ZONE ONCE A GOOD DANCER IN SOME AREAS WHILE PROTECTING OUTLYING. AREAS SECONDLY TO SPRAWL SO I THINK THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION- AND IT'S AN APPROPRIATE ONE- WE DEAL WITH SOMETIMES SPECIFIC BILLS SPECIFIC CITIES AND COUNTIES ON A REGULAR BASIS WE DO WITH NAPA. COUNTY AND NOT THE CITY LAST YEAR ON A VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE- WHICH IS A VERY PRO HOUSING BILL BUT REALLOCATED RINA. BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE WOULD NORMALLY DO BUT IT MADE SENSE. IN THAT SPECIFIC SITUATIONS OF A GOAL ANYA AND- IS TO ALLOW FOR MORE HOUSING ZONE FOR MORE HOUSING. TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON HOUSING AND URBANIZED. AREAS RATHER THAN GOING TO EARN FURTHER OUT HAVING SPRAWL. THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES THAT IT'S A GOOD BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO MOVE A- THE YOU BUT SHE THE CENTER WE HAVE A MùT. ON THE FLOOR WE STILL HAVE NUMBER DISCUSSION ON SB NINE FORTY. RENT TURNED OVER TO THE GOOD SEND OF THE DEAN OF THE SENATE MISTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. IN THE PAST DIVE OPPOSED SIMILAR BILLS BECAUSE OF MY CONCERN ABOUT EQUITABLE TREATMENT TO RURAL COUNTIES. I'VE COME UP WITH THE- CATEGORIZATION OF COUNTIES I COLUMN SUBURBANITES AND COUNTY SUBURBAN. URBAN RURAL SUBURBAN ICING SUBRBAN ISING WOULD BE IT UP COUNTY IN TRANSITION FROM HAVING BEEN HISTORICALLY BASICALLY RURAL. AS CONTRA COSTA WAS AS EVEN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY HAD HEAVY AGRICULTURAL BASE AND OVER THE YEARS THAT DECREASED. WELL MY ONLY QUESTION- OF NOT A QUESTION BUT I EQUEST I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL.

THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ADVOCACY FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA MR SENATOR VERY GRATEFUL. PLEASE A CENTER WINNER CAN I RESPOND TO THE TIME TO CENTER NIELSEN I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND WHEN WE DID THE WORK LAST YEAR WITH NAPA COUNTY NAPA CITY OFFICE IN NAPA COUNTY A LOT OF THOSE COUNTY IS ROLE- AND PART OF THE GOAL THERE.
