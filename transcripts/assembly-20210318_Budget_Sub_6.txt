AND I THINK IF YOU'RE THERE YOU CAN JUST START TALKING AND YOU'LL COME ON THE SCREEN I AM HERE. CAN YOU HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR AND SEE USE PERFECT. ALL RIGHT GREAT. FEEL FREE TO LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR ME TO BEGIN OKAY WE ARE READY. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON- AS YOU MENTIONED I'M SECRETARIAL UNDER RICHARDSON OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE. OCTOBER NINETEEN VACCINATIONS TO CALIFORNIANS AS QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE- I'LL JUST MENTION TO THE COMMITTEE THAT DUE TO THE URGENCY OF OUR WORK. I DO HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TODAY BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON. ON ANYTHING YOU MAY NEED THAT I MAY NOT ADDRESSED IN MY REMARKS- I'M VERY HONORED THAT THE GOVERNOR ASKED ME TO JOIN THE STATE'S VACCINE TEAM. TO ASSIST WITH OPERATIONS AND FIND WAYS TO INCREASE THE SPEED AN EQUITABLE DELIVERY. OF COVERED BY NINETEEN VACCINES. I WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SECRETARY MARK GALLI. DR NADINE BURKE HARRIS- DR OCTAGON AND DOCTOR KLEIN ON VACCINATION PLANNING ELIGIBILITY. ALLOCATION EQUITY AND ACCESS. SINCE JANUARY WHEN THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO BUILD A STATEWIDE. PROVIDER NETWORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR IN THIS CASE A BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA- I HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK. HELPING TO CREATE THAT NETWORK. TO SCALE UP THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER VACCINES. IN TANDEM WITH THE GOOD WORK BEING DONE IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. WELL THERE WAS TREMENDOUS WORK DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DELIVER VACCINATIONS. THE SHEER VOLUME OF WORK REQUIRES US TO SUPPLEMENT THE STATE'S CAPACITY. TO DELIVER THOSE VACCINES SO THAT WE CAN KEEP. PACE WITH THE EXPECTED SUPPLY. WE ALLOCATING. TO REACH PRIORE BROUGH. SUCH AS TEACHER. AND FARMWORKERS SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN MOVING DOWN THE ELIGIBILITY TEARS. RECOGNIZING THAT VACCINATIONS WERE GOING DISPROPORTIONATELY TO THE MOST ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. WE WORKED AS A TEAM ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO MOVE MORE OF THE VACCINE SUPPLY TO THE COMMUNITIES HARDEST HIT IN THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS INTENDED TO REBALANCE THE ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES SO THAT THE DOES REACH CALIFORNIA'S MORE EQUITABLY. AS YOU KNOW OUR PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS INDICATED THERE WILL BE ENOUGH VACCINE SUPPLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BY THE END OF MAY AND HE IS CHALLENGES TO BE READY TO DELIVER IT. TO ALL AMERICAN ADULTS WITHOUT REGARD. TO ELIGIBILITY RULES STARTING ON MAY FIRST THAT MEANS WE NEED TO BE READY- WE NEED TO BE READY TO RECEIVE PROIN SHIPMENTS OF VACCINE. THROUGH MARCH THE VACCINE SUPPLIES HAVE BEEN ALMOST FLAT AS THE ABILITY TO ADMINISTER SUPPLIES GREW THE SHORTAGE FAIL MORE ACUTE AND THERE HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATIONS BY THOSE WHO ARE SO READY TO GIVE SHOTS IN ARMS- AND WISH THAT THEY COULD GET MORE SUPPLY. UNFORTUNATELY LIKE EVERY STATE IN THE NATION- WE HAVE BEEN GETTING LESS VACCINE THAN WE NEED BUT IN APRIL WE EXPECT THAT TO CHANGE. BASED ON MEETINGS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ARE EXPECTING A SHARP INCREASE IN VACCINES STARTING JUST IN THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT TODAY THAT WE WILL BE READY TO GET THOSE VACCINES INTO ARMS. WE'VE BUILT A STATEWIDE VACCINE NETWORK WITH BLUE SHIELD THAT WILL BE CAPABLE OF ADMINISTERING AT LEAST FOUR MILLION DOSES OF VACCINE PER WEEK. JUST IN THE LAST SEVEN DAYS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ADMINISTERED. OVER TWO MILLION DOSES. I HUNDRED AND SIX APRIL ARE THE NETWORK. IN SIX ONE. QUALIFIED OR COMMITTEE HEALTH. THIRTY SIX HOSPITAL SEVEN MEDICAL GROUPS AND THIRTY THREE PHARMACIES AS WELL AS OUR MULTI COUNTY HEALTH SYSTEMS WHICH INCLUDE. UC'S YOU SEE SUTTER DIGNITY KAISER ADVENTIST PROVIDENCE AMONG OTHERS. NEW PROVIDERS ARE BEING ADDED DAILY AND BY APRIL AND THREE MAY EASE PROVIDERS WILL OFFER VACCINATIONS AT THOUSANDS OF SITES ACROSS THE STATE. TO KEEP PACE WITH THE DRAMATICALLY INCREASING VACCINE SUPPLY AND AUGMENT THE GOOD WORK OF OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. IN ADDITION WE ARE CONTINUING TO FORMALIZE AGREEMENTS WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF CALIFORNIA SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. SO THAT WE CAN WORK SIDE BY SIDE TO GET THE JOB DONE WITH AS LITTLE DISRUPTION AS POSSIBLE TO THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING. ALL OF US SHARE THE SAME GOAL GET VACCINATIONS AND ARMS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO SAVE AS MANY LIVES AS WE CAN. AND GET BACK TO A MEASURE OF NORMALCY IN OUR STATE. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY IN THE LEGISLATURE AS WE CONTENT TO BE WORK AT A FURIOUS PACE. LITERALLY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK LATE INTO THE EVENING EVERY NIGHT SINCE JANUARY TO ACCOMPLISH THE MONUMENTAL TASK OF ENSURING THAT OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. CAN GET VACCINATED AND THAT NO COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT BEHIND. AS WE VACCINATE WE WILL BE MONITORING OUR PROGRESS WITH TIMELY DATA TO INFORM WHERE ADJUSTMENTS NEED TO BE MADE. TO ACHIEVE OUR STATEWIDE GOALS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR PROGRESS. THANK YOU MA'AM. LET'S GO TO- THIS NELLIE DID PUBLIC.

THROUGHOUT THE VACCINE ALLOCATION AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS WE HAVE A PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF THOSE MOST AT RISK OF EXPOSURE TO THE DISEASE AND OR SEVERE OUTCOMES WITH RESPECT IS SEVERE DISEASE THERE ARE DISPARITIES AS YOU KNOW BASED. ON RACE ETHNICITY AND AGE. D. FROM CALIFORNIA. THAT SEVERAL ARE HIGHER OF THIS DISEASE SEVERE OUT. DUE TO KOVEN. I'M AN AGAIN THESE JUST BEAR. DISPARITIES REFLECT IN WHAT THE BLACK AND NATIVE HAWAIIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO VACCINATE ALL CALIFORNIANS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO VACCINATE FIRST THOSE WHO ARE AT HIGHEST RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE EQUITY IN OUR VACCINE ADMINISTRATION THE STATE IS FOCUSED ON SEVERAL STRATEGIES EQUITABLE ALLOCATION OF VACCINE TO THOSE MOUNT THOSE MOST SEVERELY IMPACTED IT. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA STATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL EQUITY PLANS INCLUDING EQUITY IN THE LOCAL TRANSITION PLANS TO THE STATE WIDE VACCINATION NOT WORK. UNDER THE TV A AUGMENTATION OF VACCINATION EFFORTS- OUTREACH EDUCATION ENLISTING THE HELP OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND ESTABLISHING METRICS AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THIS I HOPE DEMONSTRATES CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO EQUITY AS WAS DONE WITH TESTING AND THE CORPORATION OF THE HEALTHEQUITY METRIC INTO THE BLUE PRINT FRAME WORK. AND PRIORITIZING INCLUDE OUR RESOURCES TO INCREASE TESTING ACROSS THE STATE. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ALLOCATION FORMULA THE STATE IS IMPLEMENTED THIS THAT DIRECTS INCREASE SHARES A VACCINE TO THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY THE PANDEMIC AND AS A STATE WIDE LOOK BY ZIP CODE AND BY THAT HEALTHY PLACES INDEX QUARTILES- IN WHICH THOSE AND- ZIP CODES FALLING. THE LAW- MOST IN CORE TIME I'LL GET EXTRA 2% OF THE STATE I'LL- WE'VE ALSO SUPPORTED SOME IN THIS. FOR KEEP AND- MAX FOR IS A IS TRANCE. WORKERS TEACHER AND OTHER GROUPS EITHER HAVE A HIGH RISK OF EXPOSURE OR HIGH RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE. THE STATE'S PRIORITIZATION ELIGIBILITY GUIDANCE. ALSO SUPPORTS ALLOCATING AND TIONAL. TO IN. INTO KEEP EXT HOME. AND PEOPLE WITH HIGH RISK MATT. OR JUST A CAN. THESE ARE DESPERATE- MADE UP OF LOW IN FOLKS AND KEEP OF COLOR. WE ALSO HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR PROVIDER PRIORITIZATION THE STATE IS TAKING STEPS TO IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT PROVIDERS THAT SUCCESSFULLY ADMINISTER VACCINES TO THOSE PEOPLE RIGHT RESIDING IN THIS LOWEST. H. P. I. QUARTILE WE'RE ALSO ALLOWING YOUR THROUGH THE MY TURN SYSTEM ALLOCATION OF EMPLOYMENT EITHER BY ISSUING CO YOU TOO CAN BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO APPOINTMENTS AND ALSO TO DO THINGS LIKE CLOSE CLINICS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO MEET WITH.

THE CAMPAIGN CENTRAL MESSAGES ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL SCIENCE BASED FACTS ABOUT THE VACCINE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE VACCINES ARE SAFE AND HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND THEY'RE FREE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS MESSAGES ALSO HELP TO FOCUS CALIFORNIA'S TO NAVIGATE ELIGIBILITY AND THE PROCESS FOR GETTING A VACCINE. THE CAMPAIGN IS ALSO ADDRESSING THE BARRIERS BARRIERS AROUND ACTING HESITANCY YOU'RE A COMPELLING AND CULTURALLY CONGRUENT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN THAT HELPS PEOPLE OVERCOME THEIR CONCERNS AND CONNECTED THAT BACKSEAT LEADING TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE VACCINES ARE THE BEST TO ATTENDING THE PANDEMIC. DEPUTIZING WILL RUN PRIMARILY ON ETHNIC AND MULTICULTURAL MEDIA OUTLETS ACROSS PLATFORMS LIKE TV RADIO DIGITAL NEWSPAPERS AND BILLBOARDS THE CAME CAMPAIGN FEATURES ADDS A MORE THAN A DOZEN LANGUAGES IN ALL MEDIA MARKETS OF CALIFORNIA.

NEW LOCK I'M THE TYPE TO THE LAST TO A- FOR VACCINE OFFIT EIGHT .COM LAUNCH. CBO WORK AT BOTH THE AND LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT MESSAGES GETTING LOUD IN CLEAR TO ENTER PEOPLE TO WHERE THEY GET BACK. WE'VE ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE MEASURES OUR PROVIDERS TERMS OF COLLECTING THAT DATA INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA SUCH AS RACE AND ETHNICITY AND ZIP CODE- SO THAT WE REALLY KNOW WHO WE ARE VACCINATING IT'S ONE THING TO DO OUTREACH AND TO HOLD CLINICS IN. A PARTICULAR LOCATION IT'S ANOTHER TO MEASURE EXACTLY WHO'S GETTING THE VACCINE. ARE WE ARE I'M ASKING THAT PROVIDERS COORDINATE WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT EQUITY PLANS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING IN SYNC TO REDRESS THE POPULATION NEEDS WE ARE MEASURING THE H. B. I. QUARTILES IN THE REACH OF THOSE ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO SET UP PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE GPA AND FOR CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE WE CREATED A VACCINE EQUITY METRIC TO MONITOR THE DOSE IS ADMINISTERED TO THE H. P. I. QUARTILES. AND HAVE POSTED THIS ON OUR PUBLIC DASHBOARD IN ORDER TO HOLD OUR WHOLE STATE ACCOUNTABLE INCENTIVIZE VACCINATIONS OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY POPULATIONS WE SET BENCHMARKS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DOSES ADMINISTERED IN H. B. I. QUARTILE ONE. OUR LEAST ADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ONCE WE REACH TO IMPORTANT THRESHOLDS WE CAN MODIFY THE THRESHOLDS BETWEEN OUR BLUEPRINT FOR STATE PARK ON THE METEOR. TO ALLOW FOR SOME OF THE SAME ACTIVITIES AT THE SITE HIGHER RATE. ULTIMATELY THE DATA NOT MORE THE STATE TO SHIFT IN OUR- AS NEED TO INSURE THAT WE MET ME OUR EQUITY. I'LL STOP AND I KNOW I THROUGH A LOT OUT THERE BUT I HOPE IT. SHOWS THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO. NOT ONLY. ALL CALIFORNIA MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE VACCINATING THOSE MOST AT RISK OF SEVERE- DISEASE OR HOSPITALIZATION THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISCONDUCT. WITH L. A. L. I THANK YOU MISTER. US ANY PICK FROM THE ELADIO. L. IT WAS HONEST TAKING ANY. THEY MEMBERS MAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WAS GONNA TRY OVER THE MEN SEE MISTER CARLY. I JUST A QUICK QUESTION ME- IT'S BEEN AND YOU MEANT THE HEALTH. PLACE IN THAT. AND- I WONDER HOW IT WAS THAT THIS WOULD BE THE YARD FOR EQUITY BECAUSE I KNOW THIS HAS TWENTY FACT OR SOME LIKE THAT SO NUMBER KIND OF INTERESTING- NOT EXACTLY EXPECT SUCH AS AVOID ALCOHOL AVAILABLE- IS ONE OF THE FACT. WERE YOU HAVE MORE BARS AS I CONSIDERED BETTER SO. HOW IS IT IS THIS THE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THE MEASURE. WE WERE WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURIST. AS WELL AS AN- YEAH AT. WE DID MOST OF THIS WORK EARLY ON. WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT. THE PRINT EQUITY METRIC AND- AT- YOU KNOW HOW WE COULD. DEFINE THAT MATCH AND SO WE DID WORK CLOSELY. OUR PART AT THE- LEVEL TO DETER. WHAT THOUGHT WERE BE THE BEST I'M- AG. KIND OF- INDEX THAT WE COULD USE THAT WOULD CROSS. THE STATE AND BRINGING THEM. ACCOUNT MANY FACTORS AND SO I THINK. WE DID THAT EARLY WORK AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE SOME OF THAT- I CAN HAVE OUR EQUITY TEAM SORT OF. LAY OUT THE REASONS WHY THIS WAS CHOSEN. AND HAPPY TO GET BACK TO WITH THAT. THANK YOU MISS FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MAYBE YOU CAN- WALK WITH YOUR SEASON- THE I WANT I GUESS TALKING TO PUBLIC HEALTH A DIRECTORS I GUESS FROM MY OWN WHAT I'M HEARING IS THEY WOULD LIKE TO. HAVE SOME ABILITY THAT PLANNED OUT FURTHER OUT IS THERE A WAY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH LIKE A- I GO TO A THREE WEEK OUTLOOK IN TERMS OF VACCINES- IMMEDIATE UPDATE WHAT WE'RE RECEIVING AS A STATE I'M I'M ASSUMING ISN'T HASN'T CHANGED FROM WEEK TO WEEK MADE IT'S GOING UP. WHICH IS POSITIVE BUT IS IT IS IT IS IT IS THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SOME LIKE. BASELINE LIKE EVERY WEEK YOU'RE GOING TO GET AT LEAST THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT- AND WE'LL DO MORE- NOW WE ARE GETTING BETTER INFORMATION FROM THE CDC SO THAT WE CAN- AND AS YOU KNOW EVER PROBABLY HAVE HEARD WE HAVE KEPT THAT LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS LEVEL FOR ABOUT THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND WE I'M- CONTINUE TO WANT TO GIVE THEM TWO TO THREE WEEKS OUT AND TO GIVE THEM A PROJECTION. AS WE ALL BUILD TOWARDS WHAT WE THINK IS GOING TO BE A BIG GRANT BUT I'VE AND VACCINE AND SO WE WILL BE GETTING THAT OUT I KNOW THAT THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR SHARED IT WITH THE LOCAL STEERING COMMITTEE I'M EARLIER THIS WEEK AND WILL HELP TO NOT ONLY GIVE THEM SORT OF TIME BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT IN THEIR JURISDICTION. BUT ALSO WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT OVERALL IN THE STATE COMING IN OVER THE NEXT THREE SIX EIGHT WEEKS SO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER PLANNING- ASSUMPTIONS TO WORK FROM OKAY SO THAT'S IN THE IT'S IN THE WORKS I MEAN I JUST I'M THE- A LOT OF. HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE TRYING TO HELP EXPECT TO PASS BUT EXPECTED THE GOING TO RIGHT SO. IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MISTER LIKE. KERN COUNTY FIFTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND. BUT THEY GONNA GET. A. B. SEVEN THOUSAND DOSES AND UP OFF A WEEK THEY WERE WANNA. PUT THINGS IN MY- TWENTY THAT WOULD BE. GREAT OF MY PLANKS. AND THAT'S AS YOU GO BE- WOULD BE. IN TERMS THE DATA- HAS THAT IMPROVE. I THAT WAS A CONVERSATION HAD AND- YESTERDAY. ABOUT A 80% OF THE DAY BEING. AND THAT. AND EVEN BETTER THAN THAT. SOME FOLKS WERE. INTENSELY PUTTING ALL AND REPORT SOME OF THE- IN TERMS OF RACE ETHNICITY. SO I THINK WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO DO EVEN BETTER. BUT WE'RE AT ABOUT. 80% OF THE DATA BEING COLLECTED. OKAY AND JUST AND JUST BE CLEAR AND I FOR FROM FOR MY PURPOSES WHEN I LOOK ATTHE DASH. THAT IS ALL DOES IT. FROM THE CONCLUDE THE FEDERAL STATE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PHARMACIES. IN THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL ENTITIES AND THEN- WHATEVER. AND OF COURSE ALL THE ALLOCATIONS GOING PER TO THE COUNTIES THAT THAT'S ALL IN THIS. IN THE DASHBOARD. I'M I'LL HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE FEDERAL PHARMACY PROGRAM IT WOULD INCLUDE A LONG TERM CARE PIECE BUT I'M NOT SURE THEY HAVE A NEW PROGRAM ON THE FEDERAL PHARMACY SIDE AND I'LL HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK TO SEE IF WE- HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT DATA AND PUT IT INTO THE DASHBOARD. WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BUT OTHERWISE YES IT'S ALL OTHER DOSES. OKAY SO THEN MAYBE LET ME ASK THE QUESTION RIVERS WHAT WHAT IS THE DASHBOARD TELL ME AND WHAT I MEAN WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT DID THAT WHAT DATE IS IN THE DASHBOARD THEN IF I'M LOOKING AT IT. AND I'M SEEING- YOU KNOW CURRENT ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR THOUSAND- FIVE ONE THREE THREE DOSES HELLO ANGELES HAS THREE MILLION AS A WHAT'SIN THAT WHAT'S IN THAT. THOSE NUMBERS. WHAT'S INCLUDED I'M AT WORK. DIFFERENT SPORTS THAT WE HAVE A- THERE SO WANT TO BE SURE THE- WERE TEN. ABOUT THE SAME ONE. IT DOES SHOW. THAT THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED. AND DOSES AND MANY. BY RESIDENTS OF- THE PERSON VACCINATED. OKAY I'M WELL I'M LOOKING AT THE DASHBOARD IN THE ANALYSIS THE THAT PICKUP IN NINETEEN DASH. THAT PROVIDES UP TO WHAT'S WHAT'S IN THAT DASHBOARD. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT GOES AND WHAT DATA GOES INTO THAT THOSE NUMBERS. IT IS THE DATA ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO YOU EACH I'M JURISDICTION AND WHAT HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED BY EACH JURISDICTION BASED ON THE RESIDENTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THAT DATA IS ALL SUBMITTED BY. THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SECTIONS IS THAT CORRECT. NO IT'S ACTUALLY SUBMITTED BY WHOEVER PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT AND SO SOME OF IT IS WHAT'S DELIVERED WHICH IS IN THE DATA SYSTEM AND THEN AS WELL I'M VACCINES ARE ADMINISTERED THAT IS REPORTED. BACKSEAT OKAY I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE I THAT I GUESS IT'S A KIND OF A CONTINUING- CONCERN IS IT I JUST I GUESS FROM MY STANDPOINT I JUST WANNA KNOW HOW MANY IS COMING INTO HOW MANY DOES THE COMING A KERN COUNTY AND HOW MANY GETTING MR- IS GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO HOW MANY OF THE MEASURE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW AND THEY WERE MISSING POTS OR OF. SIXTEEN IN TERMS OF WHAT'S BEING DELIVERED- MINISTERED AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR US TO KIND OF PUT ESPECIALLY FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING SO- YEAH AND OUR DATA IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AS WE TRY TO YOU BRING AND YOU KNOW LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE M. C. E. IS THAT WE'RE GETTING DOES SAYS ARE NOW BROKEN OUT BY COUNTY. SO THAT REALLY CAN. AND WE SHARE YOUR INTEREST AND I THINK MANY SHARE THE INTEREST OF WHAT'S COMING IN EACH COUNTY AND HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY ARE GETTING. AND YOU. GETTING ACTUAL DOES THIS AND SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND IF YOU HAVE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT A COUNTY WE CAN PROBABLY DO IT A LITTLE DEEPER DIVE FOR YOU SO THIS BLUE SHIELD HAVE A ITS OWN DASHBOARD TO. THAT IS DONE I THINK THAT'S BORDER ARE YOU SAID YOU MULTIPLE DASHBOARDS I'M ONLY I'M ONLY USE THIS ONE SO IS THERE A THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. ONE ON THE COBIT NINETEENTH WEBSITE AND ONE ON AND ONE OF THEM IS REALLY ABOUT HOW MUCH INVENTORY PEOPLE HAVE ON SITE- SO THAT WE CAN BETTER. LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN DELIVERED AND WHAT THEY SAY THEY HAVE ON SITE. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING TO THE RIGHT PROVIDERS ON THE GROUND. OKAY I THINK MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE CAN WORK WITH YOU ON IN TERMS OF LIKE CLARIFYING THAT I THINK THAT. CAN BE A LITTLE CONFUSING AT LEAST FOR ME IF THERE'S A- IF THERE'S MULTIPLE DASH. AND PEOPLE GETTING MULTIPLE. I THINK THAT. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT PROVIDING THE PUBLIC ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION ESPECIALLY ON THE MAXINE'S AS USUAL. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT SO- I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE- IF YOU COULD PROVIDE AT LEAST FOR KERN COUNTY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF OTHER MEMBERS WANT. TO BREAK IT OUT THAT WAY IF. YOU COULD TELL ME. HOW MANY DOSES ARE COMING IN THE CURRENT AND HOW MANY DOSES ARE BEING ADMINISTERED TO BE VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'LL FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE ON THE- THANK YOU- ALL OF. THIS GROUP DID YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- APOLOGIES- FOR CATCHING UP TO THE HEARING I WAS IN A PROBE UP PREPARATIONS JUST NOW- I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO. AND AGAIN APOLOGIES OF THIS HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BUT- I REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF VACCINE EQUITY WITH THE LATINO COMMUNITY LATINO ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND FROM MY WORKERS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED ACROSS THE STATE AND- PARTICULARLY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE SEEN. A REAL LACK OF EQUITY WHEN IT COMES TO VACCINE THAT HAS CONTINUED TO BE A PART OF HE CONVERSATION AND- YOU KNOW MANY OF THE REASONS CONTINUE TO BE LACK OF A SMARTPHONE LACK OF INTERNET ACCESS BY A LACK OF RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION MANY LATINO ESSENTIAL WORKERS USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO. THE LARGER SITES IN IN A AND DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE LARGER SITES LIKE DODGER STADIUM MARC ARE CAL STATE LA WHICH ARE BOTH IN MY COMMUNITY AND THERE'S BEEN A HUGE DISCREPANCIES WITH SOME CODES THAT WERE USED NOT BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BUT OTHER COMMUNITIES COMING INTO EAST LOS ANGELES ANY SIDE COMMUNITIES TO GET THE VACCINE. SO I'M I'M WONDERING WHAT ARE THE STEPS NECESSARY THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS THAT HAVE LANGUAGE BARRIERS LACK OF INTERNET LACK OF SMARTPHONES LACK RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION WHO USE PUBLIC TRANSIT. TO BE ABLE TO GET THE VACCINE. SO I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EFFORTS UNDER WAY I TALKED ABOUT MANY OF THEM- IN MY- OPENING REMARKS BUT JUST TO RECAP A LITTLE BIT. I THINK ONE IS THAT EVERY COUNTY HAS NOW CREATED A VACCINE EQUITY POUND PLAN INCLUDING LOS ANGELES AND IT DOES DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE TRANSPORTATION. ACCESS BEING ABLE TO YOU I'M HAVE CLINICS THAT HAVE OTHER WAYS TO MAKE APPOINTMENTS SO MY TURN HAS FEATURES SUCH AS A PHONE NUMBER YOU CAN CALL- I KNOW L. A. COUNTY IS WORKING TO SET UP. MANY MORE CLINICS IN IN DIFFERENT AREAS SO THAT THEY HAVE MOBILE CLINICS THEY HAVE WAYS OF. EXPANDING OUT THERE REACH I'M AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF WORK BEING DONE ON OUR REGION EDUCATION THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT COUNTIES HAVE RECEIVED DOLLARS- FROM DOT IBM LAB CAPACITY GRANT AS WELL AS THEIR IMMUNIZATION. GRANT TO HELP TO PAY FOR THESE. I'M CBO IS TO HELP TO PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS UNDER WAY WE'VE ALSO BEEN. PUTTING ON SOME MAJOR SITES AND LA IS INCLUDED IN THAT EFFORT TO TRY TO REACH OUT AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO THOSE. TWO POPULATIONS THAT ARE HARDER TO REACH. I'M TRYING TO THINK OF GOING THROUGH MY NOTES TO GET AS MANY OF THE- ISSUES UNDER WAY I KNOW THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH PROVIDERS AS WELL TO OFFER SOME OF THOSE INCENTIVES AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. ON GOOD TRANSPORTATION FOR PEOPLE OR THAT WE ARE PLACING MOBILE CLINICS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE- ON THAT GOOD ACCESS WITHOUT YOU KNOW USING. MULTIPLE FORMS OF PUBLIC PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO THE SITE SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS LOCATIONS WITHIN A RADIUS OF- THESE POPULATION SO THAT THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO TRAVEL VERY FAR. HAS WHAT HAS BEEN THE OF JUST TO FOLLOW UP MISTER CHAIR THAT'S OKAY- WHAT HAS BEEN THE REASON WHY WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PARTNER SOONER. WITH ENTITIES LIKE A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WHICH ARE TRUSTED CENTERS IN COMMUNITIES WHERE WE KNOW. THAT ESSENTIAL WORKERS SEND THEIR CHILDREN'S TO ESPECIALLY AS WE CONSIDER. RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS I REPRESENT L. A. U. S. T. WE HAVE BEEN IN. CONSTANT COMMUNICATION IN TERMS OF. HOW CAN WE GET VACCINES INTO PEOPLE'S ARMS WHEN ONE THERE IS ISSUES OF TRUST THERE'S ISSUES OF TRANSPORTATION ACCESS THAT CETERA. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHY WE HAVE NOT LOOKED AT WHY THE STATE HAS NOT LOOKED AT OPPORTUNITIES. WHERE THE COMMUNITY CLINICS OR WITH LOCAL SCHOOLS TO BE USED AS TRUSTED CENTERS WHERE OUR COMMUNITY CAN CAN GO NOT ONLY. GET TESTED BUT ALSO GET THE VACCINE. SO WE'LL START WITH THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IN ONGOING WORK WITH COMMUNITY CLINICS MANY OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE PARTNERED FROM THE GET GO WITH- THESE CLINICS. I HAD THINK THAT IS BALANCED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD MUCH IN THE WAY M. VACCINE- YEAH WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH VACCINE AND SO WE'VE TRIED TO YOU. KNOW MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET ENOUGH VACCINE IN THE HANDS OF PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY CAN HOLD THESE CLINICS AND THAT- SO WE'RE JUST NOW EXPANDING NOT AS WE SEE. AN INCREASE IN THE VACCINE COMING- WE GOT THROUGH THE T. P. A. AS WELL AS BUILDING ON WHAT THE LOCAL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN WE HAVE A REAL NETWORK OF THE- AND- THE COMMUNITY CLINICS ACROSS THE STATE THAT WILL BE BROUGHT IN. I'M I THINK THERE ARE I'M CBO'S AND THERE ARE. NONE IN SOME JURISDICTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I THINK THE AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THEIR EQUITY PLANS DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE TRUSTED SITE FOR VACCINATION AND SO I THINK WITH MORE OF THESE MOBILE CLINICS COMING ONLINE I THINK THAT IS A BIGGER POSSIBILITY. IN TERMS OF REMEMBER THAT THE EARLY VACCINES SUCH AS FIZER IS VERY HARD TO MANAGE- GIVEN THE COLD CHAIN REQUIREMENTS THEY'VE JUST LOOSENED SOME OF THAT OUT EVEN ON THE FIZER SIDE AND SO. I THINK IT WILL BECOME A LITTLE BIT EASIER WITH THE MADERA AND NOW WITH THE CHANGE A VACCINE TO ADMINISTER THEM IN. MULTIPLE SITES AND LOCATIONS. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- LIVING IN ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAS BEEN. INCREDIBLY IMPACTED BY COLLUDED WITH RESIDENTS RECEIVING BEING POSITIVE WITH COLD ED DYING FROM COLD ED NOT HAVING ASKS ACCESS TO THE TESTING CENTERS THE FACT THAT SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE MYSELF INCLUDED HAVE CONTINUED TO ADVOCATE FOR EQUITY. VERY EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC WHEN THEY CAME TO TESTING WE ALREADY KNEW THAT. IT WAS NOT EQUITABLE. AND THEN WHEN THE VACCINE ROLLED OUT IT WAS EVEN MORE HIGHLIGHTED DISPROPORTIONATE WAY IN WHICH- THE VACCINE ROLLOUT DID NOT WORK AND HAS NOT WORKED FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND- MY EXPECTATION. IS THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THE IMPACT ON THE GROUND IN A WAY THAT IS REAL PRAGMATIC. THE WAY THAT IT IMPACTS PEOPLE AND THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT EVEN WITH THE MOBILE CLINICS- THERE'S TIME IN EQUITY INVOLVED I WILL I WILL I WILL TELL YOU I WENT TO- A MOBILE CLINIC SITE IN MY DISTRICT ANY GOVERNMENTAL. IT WAS ONE OF THE FAMOUS SITES FOR ONE DAY IT WAS THERE FOR ONE DAY AND IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. VACCINES FOR THE COMMUNITY. AND THERE WERE A SENIOR CITIZENS THAT WERE TURNED AWAY SENIOR CITIZENS THAT HAD TAKEN THE BUS TO GET THERE THAT ONLY SPOKE SPANISH THAT NEEDED HELP AND ASSISTANCE. AND IT WAS A IT WAS A- DEVASTATING TO SEE. THAT MY COMMUNITY AND MY ALLEY THOSE AND ONLY THOSE WERE NOT GETTING THE HELP SO ONE A ONE DAY MOBILE SITE. IN A COMMUNITY LIKE BOYLE HEIGHTS IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND SO WE NEED A LARGER PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION. TO ENSURE THAT. WE'RE NOT TURNING AWAY OUR ELDERLY COMMUNITY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SIGNED UP ON MY TURN. OUR COMMUNITIES NEED A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CARE AND A DIFFERENT TYPE OF AXIS THAT COMMUNITY CLINICS CAN BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL WITH. AND WE HAVE BEEN PUSHING AND PUSHING AND IT'S BEEN A LONGDELAY TO ENSURE THAT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN IN A IN A ROLL OUT PLAN. I REALLY DO HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER OUR OFFICES IN THE WORK IN THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO TELL YOU AND INFORM YOU WHAT IS NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE ARE SEEN AT. AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS THE COUNTIES ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE COUNTIES HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN AND COMMUNITY CLINICS HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN AND THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. AND NOT ALL OF THEM ARE REALLY IN THE ROLLOUT PLAN JUST YET AND SO I HOPE THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE FRUITFUL AND PROMISING AND THAT. WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHICH AGAIN I WILL SAY. HAVE LANGUAGE AXIS ISSUES. THE INTERNET ACCESS AT LACKING OF INTERNET ACCESS LACKING OF A SMARTPHONE LACKING OF PERSONAL- TRANSPORTATION AND RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND THEN WE TAKE THOSE ISSUES VERY SERIOUSLY SO THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO WALK TO A TRUSTED CENTER IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD CAN BE ABLE TO VACCINATE EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY BECAUSE THE LATINO COMMUNITY LIVES WITHIN MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES AND ONE HOUSEHOLD AND THAT'S WHY I CALLED IT HAS BEEN SUCH A OF AN IMPACT TOO MANY COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS FRONTLINE WORKERS- THAT LIVE IN ONE ONE HOUSEHOLD- AND SO A DIFFERENT PLAN IS NEEDED WE NEED TO REIMAGINE THE WAY THAT THE CODE BAXEEN ROLLOUT IS GOING TO WORKING COMMUNITIES. THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GET INTO A CAR AND GO TO A LARGE SITE OR DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A SMARTPHONE TO GET ON MY TURN AND I AND I JUST I PLEAD WITH YOU TO PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT IN AND WORK CLOSELY TO ENSURE THAT ARE CONFINED THAT THE LATINO COMMUNITY ISN'T LEFT BEHIND AND THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO DIE A DISPROPORTIONATE RATES WHICH HAS BEEN THE CASE PROVEN NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND WE DO SHARE A COMMITMENT WITH YOU TO- DO MORE FOR THESE COMMUNITIES WE HAVE LOOKED AT TRANSPORTATION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY CLINICS AS WE THINK. THAT THOSE ARE PROBABLY ONE OF THE KEY AND PASSED AND- PLACES ON THE GROUND TO LOOK AT- HOW TO GET THE HARDER TO REACH POPULATIONS VACCINATED WE- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. INCREASING VACCINE WE PLAN TO YOU YOU KNOW REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE IN THAT AGE PACKED LOWEST H. B. I. QUARTILE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GROUPS ARE GETTING- VACCINATE IT WILL BE YOU KNOW WITH THAT. A PRESIDENT BIDEN'S COMMITMENT TO OPEN UP TO ALL POPULATIONS BY MAY FIRST WE'RE GOING TO DO AIMED A BIG EFFORT TO TRY TO FOCUS ON THESE GROUPS EVEN BEFORE THEN SO THAT. WE DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO SATURATE THESE COMMUNITIES WITH MAXINE I'M AND THE LOCAL EQUITY PLANS HAVE MANY OF THOSE- THINGS THAT DRESSED IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL WORK WITH CBO'S ADDITIONAL WORK WITH. AND SOME OF THESE PARTNERS N THE GROUND SUCH AS F. Q. H. THESE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY DOING OUTREACH BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE IN TO GET BACK SENATE AT AND- WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE FAMILY VACCINATION AND- I'M REALLY. TRYING TO REACH OUT AND THINK- BEYOND SORT OF JUST THE ELIGIBILITY GROUPS ON HOW CAN WE I'M HOW CAN PROVIDERS USE THEIR JUDGMENT AND GETTING SOME OF THESE FOLKS. VACCINATED- TOGETHER. AS MISS RICHARDSON STILL ON THE PANEL. SECRETARY RICHARDSON. I'M HERE THANK YOU SECRETARY I REMEMBER THE CALL THAT WE HAD WITH THE LATINO CAUCUS THAT YOU WERE A PART OF AND I WANT TO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AGAIN I JUST I WANT TO JUST REITERATE. THAT YOUR SUPPORT. IN HIGHLY IMPACTED HOT ZONES. OUT WITHIN MY COMMUNITY AND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT. LATINOS WHO HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COAL BED. ARE AT YOUR TOP PRIORITY. TO ENSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE THE VACCINE NOT ONLY AND URBAN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE BUT IN RURAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING FARMWORKERS WHICH I KNOW THERE'S A NEW ROLLOUT COMING OUT AND HAS BEEN COMING OUT. OF THE FOR THEM AS WELL BUT FAMILY VACCINE. ACCORDING IS THE ANSWER TO ENSURE THAT ARE LATINOS DON'T CONTINUE TO BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY THIS VIRUS AS WE MAKE WAYS INTO RE OPENING OUR ECONOMY IN WAYS THAT ARE SAFE. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ESSENTIAL WORKERS CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE VACCINE. DEFINITELY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND TO MISS FINALES- COMMENTS THAT SHE MADE DEFINITELY WORKING WITH OUR- A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ARE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS ARE PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION FROM A TORTOISE AND ALL OF OUR- WORKERS INCLUDING LABOR- DEFINITELY PARTNER WITH THEM AS A PRIORITY AND SO. APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU HAVE POINTED OUT AND HIGHLIGHTED- AND WE WILL DEFINITELY KEEP THAT IS OUR FOCUS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO POP WITH MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THE CLARIFICATION FROM THE SPINELLI OR THIS COULD BE FROM THE SECRETARY- IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERY COUNTY HAS THEIR EQUITY PLAN- BUT THIS IS THE COUNTY IN CHARGE OF EXECUTING THAT EQUITY PLAN WAR IS BLUESHIELD IN CHARGER WHOSE. WHO'S SOME IN CHARGE TO ENSURE THAT THAT EQUITY PLAN GETS. EXECUTED CIRCA THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION IS SORT OF THE FOCAL POINT FOR THE LOCAL EQUITY PLAN BUT WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE GPA WITH THE PROVIDERS WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THE EQUITY PLANS DO SHOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THE KEY PROVIDERS THAT WOULD BE IN THE NETWORK SO IT REALLY IS A ACROSS THE BOARD. AND BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK UNLESS EVERYONE WHO HAS A PIECE OF IT IS WORKING AND SWIMMING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO TELL BLUESHIELD OR KAISER OR CVS OR WALGREENS WHAT TO DO TO THEIR- I'M SO THAT COMES THROUGH THE TO BE A AGREEMENT TO AND SOME OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE BEING SET UP BY THE TVA TO ALLOW THEM TO ALLOCATE IN THE RIGHT PLACES I'M AND SO I THINK IT WORKS SUCH THAT ALL OF THAT COMING TOGETHER AND- ENCOURAGING THEM TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION ENCOURAGING THEM TO YOU. YEAH THE WAY THAT THE MY TURN SYSTEM IS SET UP THEY CAN'T JUST BLOCK OFF TO THEIR OWN MEMBERS IT IS ON OPEN CLINICS SO THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE PEOPLE ON DO YOU SIGN UP FOR ANY CLINIC THAT'S IT WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS OTHER TOOLS BEING INVOKED TO MAKE THAT WORK I'M BUT I THINK THE M. ALTERNATELY IT'S HOW YOU ALLOCATE THE VACCINE AND FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T WORKING WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION EQUITY PLAN. WHO AREN'T VACCINATING PEOPLE IN THESE POPULATIONS THEY WERE LASSEN LAST BACK ALLOCATION OF ACSI THANK YOU WE WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DIG INTO ONE OF THE COUNTIES JUST SO WE HAVE THE MEAN I KNOW YEAH I KNOW YOU NEEDED TO TALK BROADLY AROUND FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES PERHAPS. CAN WE TALK ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR COUNTY. SURE I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS FOR ANY PARTICULAR COUNTY RIGHT OUT MY HAND BUT AND WE CAN CERTAINLY. PROVIDE THAT DO DO YOU HAVE A STAFF PERSON AVAILABLE WHO COULD TO BE ONLINE. BUT I DO WANT TO GET THEM ONLINE RIGHT NOW. IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE. I'M IS THERE A PARTICULAR COUNTY THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED AND WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN REACH SAMBAR DINO. AND LET ME CHECK IT PROBABLY I'M NOT SURE I CAN GET SOMEONE IN THE NEXT TWO MINUTES BUT- WE CAN CERTAINLY SHARE ABOUT EQUITY PLAN WITH YOU I'LL BE HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO DON'T HAVE TO BE ON. OKAY WHAT WE DON'T KNOW JUST KEEP GOING FOR A LOT OF. I'LL BE CLEAR AS WELL MISTER. THANK YOU- AND SO- I NOTICED IS NOW TO POINT SIX MILLION THAT'S AND- BEEN A MINISTER. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN. COMPLETELY VACCINATED. COMING UP MONDAY DAILY REPORT FROM TODAY BEING ON ONE SECOND I WILL TELL YOU THAT NUMBER. SO COMPLETELY VACCINATED IS FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN TWENTY FIVE WHO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BOTH DOSES. OKAY FOR THIS IS FOUR MILLION PEOPLE ARE. FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION YES. OKAY YOU CAN THEIR EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OKAY IT'S A EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION HAVE CAR WINDOWS. IN IN ROUGHLY DO WE KNOW HOW MANY ADULTS WE HAVEN'T CALIFORNIA'S LIKE TWENTY FIVE MILLION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION AS OUR ESTIMATE. GROUP PERFECT. SOUL- CONSUMING IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL BE ABLE TO GET ALL A POINT EIGHT VACCINATED THAT BE BUILT NEAR TWELVE MILLION VACCINATED TO LEAVING ABOUT- FOURTEEN MILLION MORE PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED I KNOW SECRETARY RICHARDSON TALKED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DO TWO MILLION- WE DID TWO MILLION VACCINATIONS LAST WEEK WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING FOUR MILLION DOSES PER WEEK DO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE WILL BE ROUGHLY ABLE TO HIT THAT ARE YOU KNOW LIKE HOW MANY WEEKS WILL BUILD THE HIT THAT. FOUR MILLION YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I AM I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETIME IN MAY IN APRIL- EARLY APRIL WOULD BE OUR AIM BUT SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF DOSES THAT WE RECEIVE IN CALIFORNIA- SO PURSUING THE NEXT. TWO OR THREE THE NEXT. THREE TO SIX WEEKS WITH FOR- YEAH NOT AS ART. SO IT SEEMS AT THAT PARTICULAR CASE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET- ALMOST EVERY ADULT VACCINATED- BY THE END OF APRIL OR DEFINITELY BY THE END OF MAY IT LOOKS SOUNDS LIKE. THAT'S TO ME THAT WE CAN CONTINUE GET SUPPLY AND- CAN CONTINUE TO DISTRIBUTE. RIGHT AND I THINK THERE'D BE A LOT OF UNKNOWNS THERE WITH THE SUPPLY BUT IF THAT IF THAT WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS SAYING IN TERMS OF THE DOSES WE CERTAINLY ARE AIMING TO GET PEOPLE- VACCINATED BY THE END OF JUNE I'VE NOT THE END OF MAY BUT IT WILL DEPEND BUT I THINK PROBABLY THE END OF JUNE THAT'S MORE REALISTIC. IN A NEW THING THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK- AS OBVIOUSLY THE- AS WE HAVE AS WE VACCINATE MORE MORE PEOPLE THE- THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. LEAST LIKELY TO GET VACCINATED WILL BE. MORE RIGHT THERE SOME HESITANCY THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME AND WE'RE DOING AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THINGS TO TRY TO. MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT- YEAH THAT COULD TAKE US A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. GIVEN THE SENSE WHEN CHILDREN MAY BE ABLE TO GET. VACCINATED OR WHEN THOSE. TESTS WILL BE DONE. I THINK THEY'RE JUST STARTING TRIALS WITH. YOU KNOW OLDER CHILDREN RIGHT NOW. I AM I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EARLY NEXT YEAR BEFORE WE'RE GOING TO REALLY BE- YEAH. ACCEDING CHILDREN. THANK YOU. AND- LET'S SEE IN TERMS OF THE- THAT EQUITY. I'M JUST I'M JUST GONNA REMIND THE AUDIENCE TERM AGAIN WE'RE TRYING WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A HEARING IN TO TRY TO BE. RESPECTFUL OF THAT. AGAIN WE ARE WITH THIS ONE PERSON TALKING AT A TIME- THERE'S ONLY SPEAKING AT THE DíAS STILL BE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND YOU'LL HAVE YOUR TIME. SO- IS GOING BACK TO THE TO THE HOT SPOTS- I KNOW THAT THERE WAS THE- DISCUSSION OF THE INCREASE TO FOCUS ON CERTAIN EQUITY- ZIP CODES SO IN A IN A PARTICULAR ZIP CODE YOU KNOW HOW MANY ZIP CODES FOR ROUGHLY IDENTIFIED- ACROSS THE STATE. FOR SORT OF STANDING INCREASES A VACCINATION FOR AN INCREASES OF ACCENTS. HOW MANY ARE IN THE LOWEST QUARTILE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. I THINK IT'S ROUGHLY AROUND FIVE HUNDRED. FIVE HUNDRED TO CODES. IN INDIGO RAFI OF ROUGHLY THE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE VACCINES THAT THEY ALL GOT. IT WOULD BE SO 80% IS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE LAST GOT IT. I KNOW THAT- AS AS I BAY AREA LEGISLATOR NO THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT. A LACK OF- BAY AREA ZIP CODES BEING REPRESENTED I KNOW THAT WE HAD REQUESTED THAT CERTAIN CENSUS TRACTS GET ADDED WAS IT WAS A REASON THAT- AND I THINK IT WAS A CONCERN THAT THE ZIP CODES WERE TOO BIG. ESPECIALLY FOR BERRY THAT WE HAD A NUMBER OF- POCKETS OF HOT SPOTS THAT REALLY WEREN'T SHOWING UP ON THE ZIP CODE ANALYSIS- AND SO JUST WANTED TO ASK AGAIN WHY ZIP CODES WERE CHOSEN VERSUS CENSUS TRACKS. I'M I THINK ZIP CODES VOTE ONE FOR BECAUSE OF OPERAS OPERATIONALIZE ATION IT'S REALLY HARD TO OPERATIONALIZE AT THE CENSUS TRACT LEVEL WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT VACCINATION- AND SO WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS REALLY TO PINPOINT THAT EXTRA 20% AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING. TO THOSE THAT CODES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED SO THESE ARE THE- STATEWIDE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND REALLY WANTING TO YOU SEARCH AND PROVIDE YOU KNOW SOME SATURATION TO THOSE ZIP CODES FIRST BEFORE WE SORT OF GO BACK TO MAYBE A AB. I'M MORE EQUAL IT WAS THE AND LIKE WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE EQUITY PIECE OF THIS MANY OF THESE AREAS AND RURAL CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE US OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M IN SOME OTHER PLACES OTHER THAN LA DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO LIKE THE FEMALE SITES TO USE SOME OF THESE BIGGER EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT ARE BRINGING IN EXTRA DOSES TO THE BAY AREA THAT ARE BRINGING IN EXTRA DOSES- IN SOME OTHER LOCATIONS THAT WERE TRYING TO LEVEL THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT. AND DO A TIME LIMIT I THINK I AM FOCUSED ON TO ADDRESS THE EQUITY IN THESE WERE MOST IMPACTED JURISDICTIONS AND- ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU SUIT COULD YOU DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT WAS SO DIFFICULT ABOUT OPERATIONALIZE. IN CENSUS TRACTS. I THINK IT'S GETTING IT SO I THINK OPERATIONAL IT IT'S HARD TO EVEN UP THE ZIP CODE LEVEL TO OPERATIONALIZE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY. I'M GETTING THE VACCINE I THE RIGHT PLACE TO DO THAT BUT ALSO GET ATTRACTING PEOPLE. TO COME TO THOSE SITES- WITHIN THOSE JURISDICTIONS AND SO HAVING A KNOCK ON BAXEEN AND I'M NOT FOR OF A REACH THAT THEY COULD HAVE THESE CLINICS REALLY BE WORTHWHILE AND VACCINATE. A NUMBER F PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE AGAIN WITH LIMITED VACCINE WE ARE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PUTTING BACK SEEN IN PLACES THAT I AND WE CAN USE THAT AND GET ENOUGH PEOPLE IN TO BE VACCINATED. OKAY THANK YOU. SIR SO JUST GO BACK TO THE KNOW IF YOU SO IF YOU WERE A PARTICULAR ZIP CODE WHAT WHAT PERCENT INCREASE WOULD YOU ROUGHLY. BE ABLE TO SEE. IF YOU WERE WILL. WALK YOU THROUGH THE ALLOCATION FORMULA AND THAT MIGHT HELP A LITTLE BIT SO. FIRST OFF WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO WAS ONE WE'RE FOCUSING FOR THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS ON THOSE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE AND THE THREE SECTORS THAT ARE BEEN PRIORITIZE FOOD IN AG EDUCATION AND EMERGENCY SERVICES AND SO. WHAT WE DID WAS TAKE A CALCULATION OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE ELIGIBLE- IN EACH ZIP CODE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SIXTY FIVE PLUS YEAR OLDS. AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED BY THOSE THREE. INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT BEN CALCULATES A NUMBER FOR THE ZIP CODE THE ZIP CODE IS THEN GROUPED INTO ONE OF THE QUARTILES AND THEY GOT THAT PROPORTIONATE SHARE. OF THE DOSES THAT HAVE 20% OF THAT I WAS SAYS AND IN EACH OF THOSE COURT TRIALS SO. THE 80% IS ADEQUATE TO BELIEVE- EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS BASED ON THOSE FACTORS NOW WE WILL AT SOME POINT BE MOVED TO A BIGGER POPULATION BASE WHICH WILL BE YOU KNOW. WILL SPREAD THAT I'M VACCINE OUT EVEN MORE- BASED ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN EACH I'M JURISDICTION BUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE FOCUS WAS ON SIXTY FIVE PLUS AND WHILE ON B. AND SECTORS IT WAS TRULY BASED BY ZIP CODE ON THOSE FORMULAS. GOT IT SO JUST BASED ON POPULATION BASED ON THAT SO. SOME SOME ZIP CODES COULD HAVE GOT MORE VACCINE JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD MORE OF THOSE. INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THERE'S A CUTS. CORRECT GOT A OKAY- MISTER. YEAH GOOD MANAVALA QUESTION FOR THAT TRIP. SO PART OF THE ISSUE THE- THE SUPPOSED VERSUS. IS THAT I KNOW IN MY AREA FOR EXAMPLE IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE AN UNDERCOUNT. AND WE KNEW THAT BECAUSE THESE THESE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT ARE ALSO- MAKE STATUS HOUSEHOLD WITH A LOT OF UNDOCUMENTED ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND SO TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A SHORT. IN OUR CENSUS COUNT IN FACT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE IN NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN. MOST IMPACTED BY COBIT. UP POSITIVE CASES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LOWEST COUNTED. REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE SO I WOULD JUST URGE YOU TO RECONSIDER- HELD THE DISTRIBUTION IS BEING DONE BECAUSE SIP CODE ALLOCATION BASED ON POPULATION IS NOT. ACTUALLY ACCURATE DATA FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN COUNTED UP AS AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD BE AND WE TRIED THE AS VERY HARD AS WE COULD A MEDICAL BED. AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WERE ALSO INCREDIBLY INVOLVED- BUT THERE IS A DISCREPANCY AND THERE ISN'T A LARGER DISCREPANCY IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES- TO ED AND MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOME GALS DISTRICT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO. OUR OWN HOUSE- NEIGHBORS WHO DON'T HAVE A HOME TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER THAT THE CENSUS COUNT AND WERE UNDERCOUNTED IN THE OVERALL. NOT ESTIMATE SO AGAIN I WOULD JUST URGE YOU TO RECONSIDER AND REIMAGINE THAT THE NUMBERS THAT YOU MAY SEE ON PAPER ARE NOT ACTUALLY REFLECTIVE. OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND. IN THE EMPLOYMENT SECTORS WE DID USE EMPLOYMENT DATA SO THAT HELPS TO GET OUT SOME OF THOSE POPULATIONS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT MAY BE- UNDERCOUNTED BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN WILL TAKE THAT BACK. ON THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS. GREAT THANK YOU SO THEN I'M GOING TO GO TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WHO HAVE BEEN ON WEBEX SO SHE WENT YOU START SPEAKING YOU'LL COME OFF. TO JUST THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT- THANK YOU THANK YOU TO EVERYONE HERE TODAY I AM IN A NEIGHBORING DISTRICT TO MISS CARILLO ARE HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE HIGH RATES AND AFFECTIONS HOUSE RESERVATIONS AND THAT'S AND WE'VE HAD THE LOWEST RATES OF VACCINATION ABOUT THEIR AND SO AS WE LOOK AT EQUITY- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN AREA THAT CONTINUES TO BE HARD HIT I'M- A NUMBERS HAVE IMPROVED SOME BUT WE'RE STILL IN THE LOW IS VACCINATED. COMMUNITY MEMBERS HIGHEST RATES WE ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT CAN STAY HOME- WE ARE THOSE MEN THAT HOUSEHOLDS AS WELL AS YOU KNOW EVERY SUMMER TO MISS CORREOS DESCRIPTION OUT THERE AND SO AS WE ARE LOOKING AT EQUITY. I GUESS. WHY ARE WE NOT LOOKING AT EXPANDING THE ELIGIBILITY WITHIN WITHIN THOSE EQUITABLE COMMUNITY DONE WITHIN THOSE 20% YOU KNOW THE FOLKS AT AGAIN TWENTY OF US BECAUSE I THINK. THE SIP OF THE THIRD QUARTER HAVING THEIR REGIONAL APPROACH IS HELPFUL WE'VE HAD NINE CITIES WORKING HERE TOGETHER- THEY'RE ALL YOU KNOW IN THAT LOWER 25% FOR IT HELLO THEY'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER IS THAT IT JUST WENT CITY OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO FILL SLOTS AND WE DON'T. WILL HAVE EXCUSE GOING TO WASTE ON INTO HAVING SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BIGGER HAS BEEN HELPFUL BUT IF THESE ARE THE HIGHEST ARE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. AND WE WANNA HELP CONTROL THE SITUATION THERE WHY ARE WE TO NOT VACCINATIG COMMUNITY MEMBERS THERE AND I KNOW WE HAVE A SUPPLY ISSUE BUT- IF THESE ARE HOT SPOTS WHY ARE WE PUTTING. WHY ARE WE PUTTING ANY SORT OF LIMITS ARE AND NOT JUST SAYING THIS IS BACK FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I WHAT. I'LL DO SAY WE MAKE THOSE VERY. YEAH WE'RE HAVING THE VERY. TO SEE HOW WE MIGHT ACCOMPLISH THAT BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP. TO THE WHOLE POPULATION. I'M AND SO MORE TO COME ON THAT WE ARE SERIOUSLY TAKING. YEAH LOOKING AT THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE CAN SATURATE THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE THE BIGGEST. IMPACT OF COVENT. THEN THAT WILL HELP US ALL AND HELP THOSE. THOSE THAT ARE. MOST I'M AT RISK OF SEVERE DISEASE- AND THEN THE LAST THING I WILL SAY FROM TALKING ABOUT CENSUS TRACTS AND- US THAT BECAUSE PRICES ARE JUST YOU KNOW HOW WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING EQUITABLE. ACROSS THE STATE ARE OUT THERE AND I THINK THERE'S THAT'S THAT THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHAT WE GOT ELECTED TO AYE BUT THEN THERE'S A SPACE AND HOW DO I% MAKE SURE I'M STILL BEING FAIR AND EQUITABLE TO THE REST OF THE STATE OUT THERE. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT BECOMING TOO NARROW I IT'S IN MY EXPERIENCE NOT EVEN WHEN I HAVE THE ZIP CODE AND GET THE CITY OF CONTENT COMPLETELY CONTAIN WHAT THE ZIP CODE. OFTENTIMES IT'S COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AND IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT AND COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND SO. I THIK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL AS WE TRY TO IMPROVE ON OUR METRICS I'M NOT. SAYING THAT IT'S PERFECT AND THERE'S SPACE FOR IMPROVEMENTS BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING UP THE SITUATION TO FILL OR THAT WE HAVE. A LOT OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS- THAT ARE NOT FROM COMMUNITIES COMING INTO TAKES LOTS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME. TO GET OUT THERE OR WILL YOU KNOW IT'S STILL TO BRIDGE IT UP WE CAN SIGN UP. ON IN UNTIL WE CAN SIGN UP FAMILIES IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THERE'S GOING TO BE A TRUST ISSUE. BUT IF I HAVE A FAMILY COMING INTO A HUSBAND AND A WIFE IT'S A LOT EASIER TO CONVINCE THEM TO TAKE THE VACCINE WHAT I'M HEARING I WAS LIKE. WELL MY WIFE CAN GET VACCINATED SONS IS GOING TO WAIT- EVEN THOUGH I'M ELIGIBLE OUT THERE AND SO JUST JUST WANTED TO BE MINDFUL AS WE ARE DISCUSSING EQUITY ACROSS THE STATE. OUR THAT WE KEEP. THE CLOSER THAT'S WHAT IT IS BUT WE KEEP IT BIG ENOUGH THAT COMMUNITIES WILL BE ABLE TO USE. THOSE VACCINES FOR THEIR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THANK YOU ONE AMBER. THIS THE VARIOUS. AND WE- TAKE THEM VERY. THANK YOU. AND I KNOW I HAVE A STAFF MEMBER CAROLINE KURTZ TRYING TO GET ON WITH IT SO SHE CAN TALK ABOUT MORE SPECIFICS ON THE EQUITY PLAN. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SO SHE SHOULD BE SIGNING ON ANY MINUTE OKAY- BUT ALL OF MY QUESTION AND WAIT HOPEFULLY BY THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE A STAFF MEMBER WILL BE ON ONLINE- I GUESS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE QUESTION IS JUST A FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES GARCIA'S QUESTION IS- WHAT WOULD YOU DO THESE EVENTS BY ZIP CODE I MEAN WE HADN'T EVENT IN WEST OAKLAND BECAUSE AT A CHURCH BUT THEY DISCOVERED THAT OVER HALF THE- HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR. FROM THE ZIP CODE AND FRANKLY FROM WELL OUTSIDE THE ZIP CODE OR EVEN THE SURROUNDING ZIP CODES. SO HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE HAVING THE EVENT. IN A PARTICULAR ZIP CODE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BENEFITING. THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THE ZIP CODE YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON I THINK ONE PARTICULAR. SUGGESTION OR IDEA THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM MOM DEL RECOMMENDED IS JUST YOU KNOW PERHAPS FOR THAT PARTICULAR EVENT IF YOU'RE HAVING AN EVENT JUST TO. YOU KNOW JUST A- THAT. BE MORE OPEN ABOUT WHO CAN WHO CAN GET VACCINATED JUST. THE LEVEL OF TRANSMISSIONACROSS THE BOARD IN THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY BUT WOULD LIKE TO HEAR SORT OF. AS AS YOU'RE ROLLING OUT THESE EVENTS IN THESE. HOT ZIP CODES HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY. HITTING THE YOU KNOW HE CAN DELIVER MORE. SO WHAT I'M A COUPLE OF- TOOLS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND THEN MORE TO COME ONE IS THAT THEY CAN ISSUE CODES AND SOMETIMES ISSUE CODES TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS WHO CAN HELP PEOPLE TO GET NAVIGATE TO THOSE APPOINTMENTS SO WE'RE SETTING ASIDE POINTS FOR THAT EXACT POPULATION THAT WE WANT TO SERVE IN THOSE CLINICS I'M THERE ARE WAYS TO DO CLOSE CLINICS AND TO PLACE THE CLINICS AND- STE EMPLOYMENT SITES OR COULD BE SCHOOLS COULD BE DIFFERENT PLACES WHERE. WE COULD YOU KNOW ATTRACT. PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT'S ON SAFE SIDE OR TRUSTED SITE- AND THEN WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO CORDON OFF- BY COUNTY OR BY ZIP CODE SOME OF THAT TIME. CLINICS AND SO MORE TO COME THERE WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE I'M LOOKING FOR MORE TOOLS AS WE ALL MOVED TO THE MY TURN SYSTEM I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE TOOLS OUT THERE HE AT HAND TO MANAGE THOSE WE DO HAVE WAYS OF GETTING PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES THE WEBSITE SO USING THE TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND OTHER WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE NOT ONLY PLACING THESE CLINICS AND A JURISDICTION WHERE WE WANT BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THE PEOPLE FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES. INTO YOU'VE GOT TAX ON IT AT. THANK YOU JUST TO. LITTLE JUST TO REITERATE MY MCAULIFFE LA'S. COMMENTS BEEN DEDUCTED CLINICS ARE ARE SO. IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY AS YOU HAVE- NEED TO REACH THE HARDER TO REACH COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS THERE THEY'RE TRYING TO. GET THEIR MORE TRUSTED THAN THE LOCAL PHARMACY THE MORE TRUSTED THAN THEIR HEALTH PLANS. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE WORKING THEY THEY NOT ONLY ARE CLINICS BUT THEY HAVE. STAFF MEMBERS WHO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY CONSTANTLY HAVE TO DO OUTREACH SO IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF LEVELED OUT FOR EACH THAN ANY OF THEM YOU KNOW ANY OF THE INSURANCE PLANS WOULD HAVE I WOULD HAVE KAISER BLUESHIELD WHO OBVIOUSLY DO. NOT HAVE OR HAVE NOT REACHED AFTER IS JUST IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT LEVEL AND IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CLIENTELE AND SO I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU ALL TO. ON FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU WORK SOME OF THESE VERY TRUSTED PARTNERS. NOT JUST MODERN MEDIA POINT OF VIEW BUT REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ARE GETTING CONTACTED DIRECTLY BECAUSE THEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR THEIR CLIENTELE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO. AND WE KNOW HOW TO REACH. AND THE LOCAL EQUITY PLAN DOES TAKE ZIP CODE BY ZIP CODE IN THOSE MOST IMPACTED ZIP CODE AND TELL US WHAT CBO IS THEY'RE WORKING WITH WHAT PROVIDERS THEY'RE WORKING WITH TO SERVE EACH OTHERS IT CODE SO I THINK THAT'S BEEN YOU KNOW BACK THINKING AND THAT SORT OF. WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE HAVE ACCESS IN EACH ZIP CODE I'M I THINK WILL WILL HELP US TO GET THERE WE WHICH IS AN EDWARD I DID NOT FIND ANY GAPS WILL BE HELPING WITH RESOURCES TO. MEET THOSE GAPS THANK YOU WHICH IS A PERFECT SEGUE HOPEFULLY YOUR STAFF PERSON IS ON THE SHOWN YEP SHE SAYS SHE IS ON PERFECT CAROLYN. CAROLYN YOUR INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND YOU CAN JUST START TALKING AND. YOU WILL. MAGICALLY APPEAR ON OUR SCREEN. THANK CAN ANYONE HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU YOU HAVEN'T APPEARED YET BUT WE CAN HEAR HAVE AS WE DON'T SEE YOU BUT WE CAN HEAR YOU SO WE CAN LEAST BEGIN- I THINK COULD BE HELPFULL WE HAVE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM L. A. COUNTY MAYBE YOU COULD JUST WALK US THROUGH THE THROUGH THE L. A. COUNTY EQUITY PLANTS WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA FROM GRANULARITY WHAT WHAT IT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE FOR SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES I MEAN WE HEAR FROM A HIGH LEVEL WHAT THE GOALS ARE BUT I THINK- YOU KNOW WE'RE HEARING I HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES THEY THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVEN'T REALLY FELT THE IMPACT YES WOULD REALLY. LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOME OF THE SPECIFICS AROUND L. A. COUNTY- INTO JUST TO UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW IT'S- HOW HOW DO L. A. COUNTY IS GOING ABOUT ATTACKING THIS ISSUE. SURE I HOW MY IN THE SHOWS THAT I'M ON. BUT CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WALK YOU THROUGH. THANK YOU. OKAY I AM CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WALK YOU LA'S EQUITY PLAN. SO WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED- IN TERMS OF LIKE ON THE GROUND ACTUAL WORK THAT'S TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW. IS AND IT'S AN OVERSTATEMENT AND ENGAGEMENT LOCAL COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES AND- THEY HAVE A- VERY ROBUST REGIONAL APPROACH WITH REGIONAL HEALTH OFFICERS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO OVERSEE EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS- THEY HAVE MEANINGFUL AND- COLLISIONS ARE WORKING GROUP'S WITH GROUPS SUCH. AS THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY MATERNAL TOWN OUT OF THIS ADOLESCENT HEALTH ASTHMA COALITION- THEN GAUGE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF CBS AND FBOS AN OVER ARCHING VACCINE WORKGROUPS. INTO SPECIFICALLY I'M TRYING TO WALK THROUGH EACH OF THE DIFFERENT BUT GETS ON THERE ARE THERE IS A VERY ROBUST COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM AND RIGHT NOW. AND. THEY HAVE THE- APPROXIMATELY. WHO THIS OP REALLY QUICKLY SAID PARDON. AND THEY HAVE. PARKS ABOUT AND FIVE HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER THAT ARE TWENTY TO SERVE THIS INITIATIVE- WHERE THEY'RE WORKING AND RIGHT NOW OVER A SPAN OF THREE HUNDRED CITY BLOCKS- THERE IS A- DEVELOPED SOCIAL MEDIA APPROACH. I'M PUSHING CONTENT TO- FOR BOTH THE BLACK AND LYFT NEXT COMMUNITIES AND THERE IS ALSO AND- BRADBURY IS TOWN HALL Q. AND A SESSIONS AND THAT OUR PLANET CONDUCTED ON A REGULAR BASIS. THEY ALSO DO WEEKLY PRESS BRIEFINGS THREE TIMES A WEEK TO SHARE ALL OF THE LATEST DATA AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION THE VACCINE FACTS ON TO UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS THAT THE COUNTY IS DOING. I'M PAID MEDIA AS ALREADY DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE PLAN AND THEN FAITH BASED ORGANIZATION OUT REGION PARTNERSHIP. I'M IS I KEEP MY- HELLER AND I'M THEIR VACCINE EQUITY PLAN. WE DO COMMUNICATE AND PRINTS TO QUITE A BIT VACCINE NEWSLETTERS THAT ARE DISSEMINATED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS ON A BI WEEKLY BASIS- AS WELL AS YOU KNOW I'M A NUMBER OF EARNED MEDIA I'M WITH THE BLACK AND WHITE NEXT MEDIA OUTLETS. I'M SPECIFICALLY OUT AND UPDATES ARE SEN DIRECTLY TO THE BLACK IN SPANISH LANGUAGE MEDIA OUTLETS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WEEK. AND SO THERE'S A LOT THAT STAND THERE THERE ARE OTHER AREAS OF PRIORITY POPULATIONS- SUPPORT AND GOT. LA IS VERY FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OF COURSE AND MIGRANT POPULATION THE UNDOCUMENTED. THE INCARCERATED AND DETAINED AS WELL AS THE TRIBES INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS- AND THEN I THINK YOU KNOW GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHY AND I'M L. A. COUNTY REALLY FOCUSING ON THOSE THAT ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY CULTURALLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY ISOLATED AS WELL. I AM. SO IN LOOKING AT AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE WORKERS THE DISABLED STATE WITH EACH OF THESE ELEMENTS AND WITHIN THAT THE VACCINE EQUITY PLAN THAT LA HAS AND- PUT TOGETHER AND PROVIDED TO THE STATE. I'M REALLY OUTLINES WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING BUT ALSO. WHAT ARE THE AREAS IN WHICH AND THEY COULD SPAN UP ON THOSE ON ORDER TO FURTHER READ THE COMMUTE. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO CALL MISTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MAY CHAIR CAN YOU CAN YOU WILL US THROUGH WHAT STATE FEMA CORDONING COORDINATION LOOKS LIKE FOR THE MOBILE CLINICS AND WHO EXACTLY- IS RUNNING THAT PROGRAM AND HELD THAT PROGRAM IS BEING ADMINISTERED ON THE GROUND. I BELIEVE IT'S CARILLO YES BUT IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH- THAT PLAN IT SEEMS. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE UCONN'S A CONSTANT SHUFFLING OF HOW THE PLAN IS BEING EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE SPECIFICALLY I'M YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS OF COURSE ADVOCATING FOR MY DISTRICT AND- I'M GLAD THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER. CRISTINA GARCIA IS ALSO ON THE LINE WE ARE WE ARE NEIGHBORS IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE SEEING THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH- ONE CLINIC RUN BY FEMA AND HELLO YES- IT WASN'T- NECESSARILY WELL. PLANNED OR THOUGHT OUT AND SO PEOPLE WERE TURNED AWAY- AND AGAIN AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS EARLIER SENIOR CITIZENS WHO TOOK THE BUS WHO SPOKE SPANISH WHO HAD NO OTHER AXES WERE TURNED AWAY JUST BECAUSE OF A LACK OF. PLANNING AND SO CLEARLY WHAT THAT DEMONSTRATED TO ME WAS THAT ONE DAY WAS NOT ENOUGH AND IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PERSONNEL ON THE GROUND THEY AGREED. AND SO HOW IS THAT INFORMATION BEING- TRACED UP AND THEN TRICKLE DOWN IN TERMS OF ACTUAL PLANNING AND HOW IT'S HOW IT SHOULD WORK SO THAT WE ARE. NOT TURNING ANYONE AWAY. IT IS RUN BY HELLO YES WE DO HELP ON THE GROUND THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WITH SOME OF THE CLINICAL EXPERTISE- BUT WE'D HAVE TO CHECK WITH THEM I KNOW WE ARE DOING BETTER WITH COORDINATING WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS ON SOME OF THE SITES AND IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A ROCKY START. BUT WE WILL TAKE BACK TO CALLAWAY ASKED SORT OF THE LOOK AT YOUR WEATHER A MOBILE SITE SHOULD BE MULTIPLE DAYS AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO OUR BEST WITH THE VACCINE AVAILABLE- AND THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE MORE PEOPLE SHOW UP THEN WE HAVE BAXEEN AVAILABLE SO. TRYING TO CARVE OUT AND SOME EXTRA FOR WALK INS AND OTHER THINGS SO THAT WE DON'T RUN RUN INTO THAT SITUATION AGAIN BUT THEY ARE LED BY FEMA. HELLO YES. SO I GUESS MADE MY QUESTION OR FOLLOW UP IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR IS. I WOULD REALLY LOVE SPECIFICALLY IN IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND IN IN MY AREA SPECIFICALLY AS I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE NEIGHBORING. DISTRICTS AND HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED WANT TO BE A PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE- WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE ON THE GROUND THESE ARE OUR COMMUNITIES. THESE ARE- OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND I GO TO THE CLINICS I GO TO THE SITES AND I SEE. WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT AND I'M NOT SURE ACTUALLY WHO I CAN BE SPEAKING TO TOOT. AB PROVIDES INSIGHT. TO HOW IT CAN FUNCTION BETTER WHICH IS ULTIMATELY. OUR GOAL HOW DO WE MAKE THE PROCESS OF EQUITABLE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION OF WORK. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING I IMAGINE TO BE IN SACRAMENTO AND TRYING TO IMPLEMENT PROCESS SEES ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WE ARE A PARTNER WITH THESE ARE OUR COMMUNITIES- AND I'M STILL UNCLEAR AS TO WHO MY CONTACT IS. A CALLOW YES THAT I CAN SPEAK TO AND I'VE TRIED. WE'VE CALLED WE'VE HAD. EMAIL EXCHANGES WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS AND- IT SEEMS TO KIND OF. GO AROUND ABOUT IN CIRCLES. AND SO I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MY AREA THAT CAN BE MY MAIN CONTACT. THAT I CAN HAVE. CONVERSATIONS WITH AND CREATE A PLAN THAT'S MORE EQUITABLE IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT REALLY IS GOING ON ON THE GROUND. SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT AS MANY. AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE- WHO LACK. ALL THE ACCESS THAT I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. HAVE ACCESS TO THE VACCINE. AND WE CAN CONNECT YOU WITH CALLAWAY ASKING LORENA ZERO FROM CALABASAS LEADING THE EFFORT ON THESE FEMA SITES AND- HAPPY TO CONNECT YOU WITH HER. THANK YOU. I'M GONNA MISS GARCIA. THANK YOU SO WE HAVE DIFFERENT BUCKETS OF VACCINES THERE'S THE FEMALE OF BUCKETS THERE'S STUFF GOING TO THE COUNTY THEIR STUFF GOING DIRECTLY TO THE CLINICS AND I'VE HAD THE LUXURY MAYBE OF WORKING WITH FOLKS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THERE'S NOT UNIFORMITY- ACROSS THE BOARD ON HOW WE SIGN PEOPLE UP AND SO WHEN WE FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS IT'S NOT BEING REPLICATED ELSEWHERE. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE IS PLAYING IN HELPING TO INFORM CLINICS AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE YOU KNOW OF BEST PRACTICES- SO THAT THE WE ALSO THREE TO ELIMINATE THE MOTHER CONFUSION THAT THAT THERE. SOMEWHERE MEAN FOR ARTISTIC AND EVERYBODY USING MY TURN INTO THE FUTURE- AND CONNECTING SO THAT WE HAVE ONE SOURCE ACROSS THE STATE IT'S EASY TO EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC ON HOW TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO GET VACCINATED BY A FAMOUS I AND- COMMUNITY CLINIC. HEALTH YEAH THERE SHOULD BE A ONE STOP SHOPPING PLACE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MOVING TOWARD. I'M WE DO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES WE HAVE CALLS WITH THEM SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK AND VACCINE IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ADDRESS AND EVERYONE OF THOSE CALLS. WE DO HAVE A PROVIDER TRAINING CALL ON ME AND THE T. P. A. WILL BE DOING EVEN MORE WORK AS THEY TAKE ON THE NETWORK- PROVIDERS I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU WANT TO STILL ON IF SHE WANTS TO COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL. GREAT I THINK CAROLINE WANTED TO RESPOND IF YOU FORGET JUST TO JUMP IN AS WELL. THIS. I'M SORRY THE LAST PART OF THE QUESTION. I'M SORRY ZERO SIX ZERO STILL WORLD WANTED TO. AT THE- BOND I DON'T MORE SO MY QUESTION. I'M SORRY. MR THIS IS A FAMILY MEMBER GARCIA- ADD MORE LAYERS TO MY QUESTION THAT I CAN CONTINUE TO EXPAND WHILE WE FIGURE OUT WHO THEY'RE PERFECT FOR SENATE FOR GRANT. SO YOU KNOW YOU SO THE GOAL HERE IS THAT YOU HAVE VERY WHEN USING MY TERM BUT WE'VE HEARD FROM COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. I HAVE PERSONALLY DEALT WITH IT THAT MIGHT TURN CREATES BARRIERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO EQUITY AND SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I'M TALKING TO A FRUIT VENDOR- AND WE ARE USING MY TURN TO SIGN THEM UP AND I. HAVE TO ASK HIM ABOUT INSURANCE EVEN THOUGH THAT THEY DON'T GET IT WHAT'S AND THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT LIKE WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ANYMORE WE NEED THE VACCINE- OR YOU KNOW I WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH MY TURN. AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS IN THEIR IN THE MOMENT THAT THERE LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF WORKING BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WE'RE TARGETING FOLKS ARE ARE WORKING. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY TO BE AT HOME OR OR WHATEVER CENTRAL WORKERS OUT THERE. AND SO THEY'RE LIKE WELL I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS IS THE WAY TOO LONG ON MY TURN INTO MY INTERNET BECOME A BARRIER. FOR OUR EQUITY COMMUNITIES AS WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW GET THOSE FOLKS SIGNED UP AND SO DO WE HAVE. A SYSTEM TO WORK AROUND AROUND THAT BACK CAN BE. DONE ACROSS THE STATE. AND IF NOT CAN I PROVIDE YOU ONE. IT MAKES. WE WERE CERTAINLY LIKE TO HEAR YOU OF IDEA WE ARE ALSO ARE PUTTING IN PLACE A COMMUNITY NAVIGATOR PROGRAM BY WHICH PEOPLE CAN HELP TO SIGN PEOPLE UP EVEN VIA THE PHONE OR NAVIGATE MORE QUICKLY THROUGH- THE MY TURN APPLICATION BUT I'M WE'LL TAKE THAT BACK IN TERMS OF AND WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN SKIP SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET SIGNED UP MORE EASILY BUT IF THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN TO THEM. MAKING IT TO EXAMPLES WE WORK WITH THE CLINIC THIS LAST WEEKEND. NINE TWELVE ORGANIZATIONS DEVELOP AT THOUSAND SLOTS ON AND IN THIS. UNITIES THAT ARE STILL IMPACTED AND IT WAS GOING TO THE TRADITIONAL MY TERM PROCESS AND YOU KNOW WE HAD COULD SET ASIDE TO WE WERE GUARANTEED SLOTS BUT WE STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT LONG PROCESS- IN IN WE HAD ABOUT FIFTY PEOPLE WORKING ON THIS WE HAVE FIFTY COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO WERE TRUST THAT OUT THERE WORKING. AND IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FILL UP AT THE SITES AND THAT THE SLOTS AND SO WE PUT IT ON THE INTERNET AND WE ENDED UP WITH A SITUATION LIKE YOU HEARD IN OAKLAND WHERE HALF OF THE FOLKS ONE UP IN THE COMMUNITY GETTING THE VACCINES. ON ITS A SEEMS TO BE COUNTER TO OUR GOALS SAYS THE WEEK PRIOR WE HAD A DIFFERENT SYSTEM WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FACT THIS QUOTE WE CREATED A GOOGLE DOCUMENT WITH SOME BASIC QUESTIONS TO SIGN PEOPLE UP WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT DOCUMENTATION THAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO YOU KNOW TO BE TO BE PREPARED FOR AND WHAT MIGHT MIGHT NOT WORK- BUT IT WASN'T TILL THEY WERE THERE ON SITE. AND THEIR FOCUS WITH GETTING THE VACCINE THAT WE DID AND WE COMPLETED THE MY TURN APPLICATION THERE ARE INTO ACT IN AND THAT WAS A FAMOUS LIFE YOU MIGHT AGREE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY WITH US- AND WE HAD THREE AT THE END OF THE DAY. 95% OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT CAME TO GET ONE OF TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED MAXINE'S WAR FROM EITHER WORKED OR LIVED IN SOUTHEAST L. A. COUNTY ON OVER 90% OF THEM OR OR LIGHT AND NEXT OUT THERE- WHEN YOU WALK WHEN YOU WALKED IN IT WAS COMMUNITY MEMBERS EVER STOP BEING. THAT SAME TRUSTED FOLKS THAT SIGNED THEM UP FOR THEIR TO TALK TO THEM AND MAKE SURE THINGS RUN SMOOTHLY FOR THEM AND ANSWER QUESTIONS THEY WERE TROUBLESHOOTING- BUT IT WAS OUR ABILITY TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND IN THE BACK AND- THAT ALLOWED THEM TO GET THEIR TO THEN HAVE THE PATIENCE TO SIT WITH A NAVIGATOR TO FINISH THE MY TURN APPLICATION. THAT WAS THE ONLY FOCUS AT THAT POINT THEY WERE THERE THEY WERE THERE TO GET THE VACCINE SO THEY WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE PATIENCE WHAT THIS DEBATE IS THAT PROCESS OFF. ON AND SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY TURN IS THAT AT THE BEGINNING WE HAVE TO USE YOUR SETTING THIS UP FOR FAILURE SAID BUT NOW I'VE HAD FIVE DIFFERENT OF THESE POP UPS AND ONLY ONE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S BEEN THE. ONE OR WE HAVE A WORK AROUND TO BEGIN WITH. OKAY THANK YOU ARE PRE. THOSE AND WE'LL- THAT BACK. AND CERTAINLY THAT IS OUR- FOR COMMUNITY ALLIGATORS. AS TO HOW. SOME FLEX. AROUND HOW WE GET PEOPLE INTO THE VACCINATION SITES FOR THESE COMMUNITIES SO. WE'LL TAKE THAT BACK AS A BEST PRACTICE AND SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE CAN SHARE ACROSS THE STATE. YEAH I JUST I MEAN THIS. IS SO IT'S HARD TO CREATE THEM UNIFORMITY ACROSS THE COUNTIES- IT IS. FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU HAVE COMMUNITY NAVIGATORS HAVING TO ADJUST EVERY DAY IF IT'S THE COUNTY OF ITS BE Mà IF IT'S A CLINIC. TO HOW WE DO THIS AND SO- YOU KNOW WE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE ADHERENCE SO WE COULD TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BEST EQUITY METRIC IS BUT WE'LL DO WHATEVER OF THAT METRIC WHERE YOU SEEN AS MAKE SURE IF. WE'RE REMOVING ALL THE BARRIERS POSSIBLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. MISCREANT THANK YOU. MR THREE ARE YOU DONE. I SHE SAID I THINK SHE I THINK SHE SAID I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY CALLING FROM OUT OF THE SOUTHEAST L. A. COMMUNITIES IN THAT. IF WE ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY CLINICS I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE COMMUNITY CLINICS HAVE ACCESS TO THE EXACT RESIDENTS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO. MEDIC CAL RECIPIENTS LOW INCOME ESSENTIAL. WORKERS AND ELDERLY FOLKS THAT. TRADITIONALLY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPACTED BY VARIOUS ISSUES. AND MIGHT TURN AN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE STAFF LIMITED STAFF FROM CLINICS FROM COMMUNITY CLINICS. THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE APPLICATIONS FOR THEM. SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE LITERALLY CALLING THESE RESIDENTS BY PHONE MAKING THE APPOINTMENT GOING ONLINE. AND DOING THE APPOINTMENTS THEMSELVES FOR THE CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY SERVE THAT TAKES TIME IT TAKES RESOURCES IT TAKES COMPASSION IT TAKES UNDERSTANDING OF THE LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND OTHER BARRIERS. AND SO IT CANNOT BE TURNED AROUND FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT IN NEEDS A MORE THOUGHTFUL. THOUGHT OUT PROCESS IN TERMS OF HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO REGISTER COMMUNITIES THAT AGAIN DON'T HAVE TRADITIONAL AXIS. AND SO WHEN YOU WHEN WE HAVE A NOTIFICATION OF LIKE WE'RE GONNA DO A FEMA SITE. THIS WEEKEND. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN AROUND SO QUICKLY. BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TRYING TO IMPACT. AND DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS SO. THE ONE THAT MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER A GARCIA JUST MENTIONED WE KNOW WHAT WORKS ON THE GROUND. HELP WAS REIMAGINE AND RETHINK THIS FORMULA BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET OR SMARTPHONE TO DO THEIR OWN APPLICATION AN APPOINTMENT. ON MY TURN IT TAKES. DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS TO CALL AND ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN THAT THEY'RE REGISTERED AND THAT WHEN THEY SHOW UP. THERE ON THE MY TURN APP IF THAT'S THE CASE IT IF THEY HAVE TIME TO DO THAT AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE TIME. THEN WE NEED TO ENSURE A PROCESS IN WHICH- FOLKS CAN SHOW UP. AND BE REGISTERED AT TO GET THE APPOINTMENT SO THAT YES I AGREE THE DATA CAN BE COLLECTED THROUGH MY TURN AS A ONE HOP STEP. BUT WE JUST NEED A DIFFERENT PROCESS IN TERMS OF HOW IT WORKS. IN HOT SOUNDS THAT HAVE YET TO BE- THAT HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE SO I JUST WANT TO ECHO THOSE SENTIMENTS AND HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT. THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE EXISTED THUS FAR IN THE PROCESS THAT HAS EXISTED AS FAR IS RECOGNIZED AS SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT WORK AND HAS NOT WORKED IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. AND THAT WE NEED TO RETHINK A DIFFERENT APPROACH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND YES THAT IS THE IDEA BEHIND OUR NAVIGATOR PROGRAM WE ALSO. PROVIDING FUNDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TWO YOU. INCREASE AND- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PRESENT SO THAT WE CAN REALLY HAVE THOSE TRUSTED MESSENGERS ON THE GROUND HELPING TO GET PEOPLE SIGNED UP. AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME INCENTIVES AND SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY CLINICS AS THEY- PROVIDE YOU KNOW. MAY OF THE SERVICES THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED AND THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT. IT TAKES TO GET PEOPLE SIGNED UP AND VACCINATED. SO JUST TO FOLLOW UP I THINK JUST IN ORDER FOR MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW. L. A. COUNTY IS DOING AND WHO TO WORK WITH TO. WORK ON SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF THE UNDERGROUND DISTRIBUTION. IS THAT WORKING GIRL. THAT WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE MISS FINELLI OR THE BETTER OFF WORKING WITH THE COUNTY. I THINK THAT PART WASN'T NEARLY AS THE LOCAL ON THE HEALTH. WHO'S THE EPICENTER OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND- BUT IT'S ALSO THE T. P. A. IN TERMS OF THE PROVIDER ALLOCATIONS AND YOU KNOW WHERE THE VACCINE IS GOING AND TERMS OF THE COMMUNITY CLINICS ON OTHER SITES BUT THAT IS WE ARE WE'RE BRINGING THOSE PEOPLE TOGETHER ON THE GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE WORKING IN THE SAME WAY AND TO ADDRESS THE POPULATIONS ACROSS THE STATE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS SO I THINK THE STARTING PLACE IS PROBABLY THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND IF- WE NEED TO CONNECT YOU WITH THEM OR WE CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE IN THAT EFFORT YOU KNOW HAPPY TO DO SO. GREAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MY COLLEAGUES. GREAT HEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR- STAFF MEMBER FOR JUMPING ON SO QUICKLY QUICKLY- WE'RE GONNA GET READY TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. TWO WHICH IS THE CODE NINETEEN EXPENDITURE PROPOSAL. I BELIEVE WE HAVE MISTER BENSON FROM FINANCE. IT MORNING YES SIR MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE THIS IS STEVEN BENSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE- SO IT IS YOU TO THE ADMINISTRATION. PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING COBRA OR- IN THE BY YEAR SO. I SINCE THE OF THE PANDA CAL HAS BEEN FROM RIGHT SO THAT WE READING HELP MAKE A THE IN ENTRANCE OF NINETY. AND USED IF UNDER THE EMERGENCY THAT AND OTHER LAWS GOVERN PUBLIC HEALTH AMERICA. IT'S REALLY DRIVING BY CALLAWAY AND HOW INSURANCE AGE. WHO WITH LOCAL. WITH THE FOR STATE USUALLY AND PRIVATE SECTOR RESOURCES TO SUPPORT. COMMUNITY RESPONSE. AND AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE RESPONSE. YOU HAD A LOT DIFFERENT AFTER INCLUDE NH&lt;c.cyan&gt; OTHER PARTS. HOSPITAL MY&lt;/c&gt; SIR STATEWIDE TESTING CONTACT TRACING. A VARIETY OF NON CONGREGATE SHELTERING PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE. DESIGNED TO HELP- SUPPORT THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND OF COURSE MOST RECENTLY THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION MINISTRATION EFFORTS THAT WE JUST YOU KNOW HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION ABOUT- SO IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTED APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AN ESTIMATED. DIRECT CODE NINETEEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE COSTS. AN ESTIMATED GENERAL FUND IMPACT ABOUT APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION. AND NOT JUST THIS LAST TUESDAY BINANCE RELEASED ITS MARCH THIS BILL UPDATE AND THEN UPDATE REFLECTS APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN POINT ONE BILLION IN TOTAL ESTIMATED DIRECT COVERT NINETEEN BRIDGES HE RESPONSE COSTS WITH A GENERAL FUND. MANAGER OF AN IMPACT THAT IS NOW SITTING AT APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT NINE BILLION SO DECREASE OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION SINCE JANUARY IN TERMS OF GENERAL FUND IMPACT. I MOST NOTABLY CHANGING SINCE THE GOVERNOR BUDGET OF CALL IS A THIS BACKS DISTRIBUTION IS ACT. WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT- SO OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THAT THE NUMBERS EVERY TIME ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL ARE BASED ON THE JANUARY. INFORMATION THAT WE RELEASED WITH THAT WITH THE PROPOSAL THESE WILL BE UPDATED AS WE MOVE INTO THE MAYOR OCCASION TO REFLECT- HAVING OUR MOST RECENT COST ESTIMATES. ARE FACTORED INTO THE FRAMEWORK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED REDRESSING COVERT NINETEEN IN THE BUDGET YEAR. BUT USING GIVEN THE PROPOSAL IS WHAT POINT IN TIME AS OF JANUARY THAT'S KIND OF THE NUMBERS ALL TALK TO. SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- AS A MENTIONED THERE'S ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF ESTIMATED COST. FOR FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. EXCUSE ME. OF THAT. WE PROPOSE TO PUT Y. POINT BILL. DIRECTLY INTO NINE SPECIFIC I FOR PREPARATION WITH AN INDIVIDUAL. BUDGET THREE FOUR HUNDRED. R. FOR ACTIVE. THAT AT THE TIME WERE IN A REAL TO HOSPITAL MEDICAL CONTACT OTHER RESPONSIBLE COST WHERE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE RECISELY WHICH AMOUNTS NEEDED TO BE ALLOCATED TO WHICH DEPARTMENTS. SO THAT MONEY WAS. LEFT ASIDE IN ESSENTIALLY TO BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE DRILL PROCESS LIKE WE HAVE BEEN DOING THROUGH ALL OF THE CURRENT YEAR. AND THAT REALLY GETS INTO WHAT WE PROPOSED TO CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE TWO BUT I'LL GET ON JUST A MINUTE BUT THAT% WOULD BE A MECHANISM THAT WE WOULD USE TO ADMINISTER THAT. ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO GET IT TO THE RIGHT DEPARTMENTS WHEN IT IS DETERMINED PRECISELY WHO NEEDS TO MAKE THE EXPENDITURES. SO TALKING BRIEFLY ABOUT THE CONTROL SECTIONS. THERE ARE TWO OF THEM- LEVIN POINT NINE ONE. IS SET UP TO HELP FACILITATE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT- TOOLS TO HELP US RESPOND TO CRITICAL NINETEEN RESPONSE AS AS IT EVOLVES THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THAT CONTROL SECTION. IS SPECIFIC TO THE FUNDING THAT I JUST MENIONED BEING PROPOSED INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT BUDGETS. THE FIRST. OF THE CONTROL SECTION WOULD ALLOW US TO EAT TO DECREASE. ANY OF THOSE ITEMS APPROPRIATIONS IF IT BECOMES. WE'RE THAT SOMEBODY EXPENDITURES NEED TO BE MADE BECAUSE OF WHATEVER- EVOLVING SITUATION I THINK OKAY. IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW US TO TRANSFER% FUNDING BETWEEN. POSTCODE NINETEEN SPECIFIC ITEMS OF PREPARATION SO THAT IF IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT SAY YOU KNOW STAFFING CONTRACT FOR EXAMPLE NEEDS TO BE. EXECUTED IN THE MINISTRY BY CDPH INSTAGRAMS ARE VICE VERSA WHICH GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE FUNDING TO THE ENTITY. THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO MAKE THE EXPENDITURE. THE SECOND COMPLY. WAS REALLY PUT IN PLACE. DISSIPATING WHAT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AND PRIVATE FUNDING MAY BECOME AVAILABLE NOW IT'S SIMILAR TO THE STREET FRAMEWORK AND STRUCTURE CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT IN TERMS OF THE CRITERIA THAT NEED TO BE IN THAT BUT IT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO CREATE. A NEW FEDERAL TRUST FUND ITEMS THE CORPORATION AS WELL AS AUGMENT EXISTING ONES SO THAT AS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING OR PRIVATE FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE WE COULD GET THAT MONEY INTO DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS IN AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURE IN THE QUICKEST WAY POSSIBLE- WE PROPOSE THAT. WITH THAT RECOGNITION THAT LARGELY A FREQUENTLY SOMEBODY'S FEDERAL FUNDS COME TO US WITH A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSES AND SO- BEGAN USING THE FRAMEWORK OF SECTION TWENTY EIGHT WHERE WE'RE SAYING THE FUNDING HAVE TO BE SPECIFICALLY FOR COVERT NINETEEN WE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW. NOW THEY NEED TO BE USED FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY FOR OVER NINETEEN RESPONSE RECOVERY AND THOSE ARE KIND OF CRITERIA THAT WOULD BE AND THEY HAVE TO- IF YOU'LL ACCEPT THE FUNDS WITHOUT BEING A TO COMMIT ADDITIONAL STATE. FUNDING INSTEAD EXPAND THE AND SO THOSE GREAT. HELP US TO CAN MAKE SURE IT'S MORE FOR. IN HOW TO COPE WITH IT IN AND USE A TWO X. TO MEET EXPENDITURE ON THE NEEDED. ACTIVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. CONTROL SEXUAL LEVEL NINE TWO. IS THE SECOND TIME THAT BRIEFLY. A MINUTE AGO IT SET UP BASICALLY TO ALLOW FOR THE CAN. USE OF THE DESERT RISK EMERGE ARE. THAT CAN. AFTER JUNE THIRTY OF TWENTY ONE. AND WAY THAT RELY OR DOES FOR PROJECT PERSON TO COME. IS SET UP IN SUCH. WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO A FOR NIGHT. RESPOND AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY ONE. I WITHOUT. WHEN SIMILAR WE HAVE A CONTROLS ELEVEN NINETY. AND AGAIN BIG IS REAL. IN PLACE THE- BUDGET YOUR FRAMEWORK TO HELP US TO GET. TO RESPONSE AT. WE'RE WE DON'T YET KNOW THE WITH PERSON HOW MY THE FUNNY NEEDS TO GET. TO SPECIFIC OR GIVE US ABILITY TO GET THE FUNDING TO THE RIGHT. WHEN NEED TO MAKE NEXT. SO THAT'S GOING TO GO ABOVE- OF THE INDUSTRY FROM. ALL JUST ADD THE THAT WE X. THAT WITH ME REVISION WITH OUR NEXT UPDATE OF. COSTS WE WILL UP TO. THE SPECIFIC DOLLARS THAT THAT WOULD THAT FRAME IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH CAN PUT INTO THE PARTNER BUDGETS. AND HOW MUCH WE STILL EXPECT ME TO MINISTER THAT GENERAL. NOW I'M GENERAL ON THE. GREAT THANK YOU HI I FORGOT TO ASK- MISS FANATIC. IF STILL A THE LINE IF NOT THAT'S FINE. BRITISH STILL ON THE LINE. I AM STILL ON THE LINE GREAT THANK YOU SO I WOULD LOOKING THE EVE. FROM I GUESS THE IS THE FEDERAL. ANTICIPATING BY THE OF APRIL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THAT THE WEEK OF THAT THE WAY ENDING APRIL FOURTH WE'RE GONNA GET ONE POINT EIGHT. WILLIAM VACCINES LIKE THE THOUGHT WAS AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO BE GAY. POSTED FOR VACCINES DE. DO YOU DO YOU KNOW WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT I GUESS IS A THE JOHNSON JOHNSON BACK COME OR- WHAT WOULD BE THE UP TO IN THE TO GET TO FOR ME. WHATEVER THAT UP COULD BE. AND SO THINK WE'RE EXPECT THAT NUMBER RISE OVER THE SIXTY WEEKS MAYBE BE. BEFORE MILLION BY- MAY- AND THAT WILL. THE G. AND THAT NUMBER IN. BOTH FIRST IN SECOND- SAYS. GOT IT SO I THOUGHT I HEARD EARLY APRIL SO MORE. MADE GET TO THE MILLION. YEAH I YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE UP THE AIR WERE HOPING THEY IT'S GOING TO GROW. IN TO FORMALLY. I'M SO WAS TO SEE. ABOUT IN EARLY APRIL. I BUT I DON'T WE'LL REACH THAT TOLD FOR MANY BY- EARLY APRIL I THINK THAT'LL- BUILDING. VERY GOOD OKAY THREE YOU SO MUCH. SURE WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK THE- TOP MISTERS. AND BENSINGER RIGHT. YEAH FOR QUESTIONS BUT REPRESENT FIRST. IS DONE VERY GOOD. SO FROM L. L. THROUGH SORT OF A WHAT AND ARE SOMEWHERE COMING THROUGH OKAY. AMONG YOU'RE COMING THROUGH GREAT. GREAT THANK YOU- MY COMMENTS TODAY FIRST TALK AND- CONTROL SECTION A LOT POINT NINE ONE SPECIFIC TO FOR CAN OF CONTROLS ALL OF POINT ONE THAT ALLOWS THE IN THE- TO SHIFT THE FUNDS BUT BUT FOR CO NINETY WAS FAR BETWEEN TWELVE THE- ARE WE THINK IT'S REASON. TO PROVIDE THE ADMIN. WITH LOTS OF TO SHIP SPONSOR THE- HOWEVER WE ARE GOING TO BECAUSE WE FIND THAT THE SECTION PROVIDE SOME MORE TO. THAT'D BE DIFFICULT FOR THE MUCH TO KNOW MUCH FONG WILL BE USED. OR EVEN WHICH DEPARTMENTS ULTIMATELY RISKS THE- AS THE US WHERE NO LEGISLATIVE NO. WHEN TRANSFER ARE. WE NEED THE SEX ALSO FOR TO BE SHIFTED THREE TO THE GOVERNOR OFFICE IN PLANNING IN RESEARCH EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. AND THE ONLY DEPARTMENT WHOSE RESPONSE HAVE YET TO BE TO TRY. AS SUCH IF ONE WAS SHIFTED THESE THE ARE BE UNCLE TO THE- EXACTLY THE WOULD BE USE. ACCORDINGLY WE WRECK MODIFYING THE SEX TO RID THE ADMIN. TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE FUNDS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED. THE SECOND. FROM. ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE YOU ALLOWS THE ADMIN TO. RECEIVE AND- FEDERAL CRIED FARM SOME TO THE AUTHORITY THE- MINISTRY ALREADY UNDER CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT. MORE RECOMMENDING REJECTING THIS COMPONENT OF CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE AS I REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE PRODUCT ALREADY ALREADY PROVIDED TO THE MINISTRATION UNDER CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CONTROL SECTIONS IS THAT CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT. REQUIRES A NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. FOR AUGMENTATIONS UP BOB AS THRESHOLD. ALL RIGHTS ARE UNDERSTAND OF YOU KNOW AND PER THE SECOND COMPONENT OF CONTROLS ONE POINT NOW ONE IN ORDER TO ACT THE PROCESS OF THE- FEDERAL OPEN FARMS TO DEPART- WE NOTE CAN SECTION EIGHT IT HAVE THAT NOTE OR THAT I DON'T. ON CAN BE EXPERT AND IN FACT ALLEGE HOW EXTRA THAT ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS AFTER OF THE MINISTER OF VICIOUS REALITY FUNDS CORPORATE RESPONSE SO WE THAT THE EXIST CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT ALREADY PER THE ADMINISTRATION ENOUGH MY AND PROVIDE MORE OVERSIGHT. WITH RESPECT TO IT WOULD RESPECT TO CONTROL SECTIONAL WE NINE TWO WOULD ALLOW THE ADMIN. TO CONTINUE TO USE THE- TRIO OF. BY TO ARE YOU FUNDS IN OUR BOB HONG KONG. NINETY THAT THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK THAT PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATION EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES REALLY LACKS SUFFICIENT CHECKS AND BALANCES AND DOESN'T PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH SUFFICIENT ABILITY TO OVERSEE. OUR EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES AND SUCH WERE RECOMMENDING A REFORM OF EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES THESE REFORMS REPLY NOT ONLY TO THE COMMON NINETEEN PANDEMICS BUT TO EMERGENCIES MORE BROADLY. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS THAT ALL EMERGENCY AUGMENTATIONS BE PROVIDED THROUGH INJURY ALL OF THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AND CARRIED OUT THE SAME WAY UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE DIFFERENT EMERGENCY- SPENDING AUTHORITIES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL USE. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO OPT PROVIDE FUNDS DEPARTMENTS WITH NO LEGISLATIVE. NOTIFICATION OR OVERSIGHT. ON THIS. CHANGE THAT RECKONED IS THE ONE TO ESTADO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AND THEN MOUNT- IN THE- THIS WOULD GIVE THE LEDGER. THE ABILITY TO HAVE IN AND THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND THEY'LL FOR SPENDING I WOULD HOME. THE CHANCE THAT EMERGENCY SPENDING ULTIMATELY UNDERMINES THE STATE BUDGET STRUCTURE OR CONDITION. WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ON REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE ADVANCE NOTIFICATION WHEN IT WANTS TO PUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS INTO A THREE HOUR. SO IN SOME YEARS B. ADMINISTRATION MIGHT NEED TO SPEND MORE ON EMERGENCIES THAN WAS BUDGETED WITH ANDREA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND SO TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PART OF THIS DECISION. WE'D RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE ADVANCE NOTIFICATION FOR JAIL BC THIS ADVANCE NOTIFICATION COULD BE STRUCTURE BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE CURRENT. ESTABLISH SHORTER NOTIFICATION PERIODS OR SMALLER TRANSFERS THAT ARE TIED TO ONGOING EMERGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE- REQUIRING SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTIFICATION WE THINK A SHORTER NOTIFICATION PERIOD- FOR THIS TYPE OF TRANSFER OF THE APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE THE AMOUNT BEING TRANSFERRED WITH THE SMALL EMERGENCY WOULD BE AREN'T GOING AND THEREFORE THEY EXPENDITURE LIKELY MORE PRESSING NEED. AND IT WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY SUFFICIENT DETAILS TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE. TO- DO AN EXPEDITED REVIEW. THE PROPOSAL. FOR HOWEVER FOR LONG LARGER TRAIN WE RECOMMEND REQUIRE A LONGER TIMES A IS VERY OR FORTY DAYS- THIS WOULD BE- PUTTING PLACE TO ALLOW THE LARGEST- GREATER TRYING TO CONSIDER IT AND I TO DO OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS- BRINGING TOGETHER AN OVERSIGHT HEARING TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT. THE TRANSFER IS APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER WE CONTINUE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED THE ADMINISTRATION THE ABILITY TO WAIVE THE NOTIFICATION- REQUIREMENT AND URGENT SIR THE CIRCUMSTANCES- IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IT WOULD BE UP TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE THE WAY BURKE AND ONCE THE WAIVER WAS APPROVED THE- EMERGENCY TRANSFER INDUSTRY A LOT COULD TAKE PLACE IMMEDIATELY. OR UPON WHATEVER SHORTER TIME THE JAIL B. C. APPROVED. WE ARE RECOMMEND REQUIRING MORE REPORTING ON EMERGENCY- SPENDING AND ALLOCATIONS FROM REAL HARM I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE WITH INFORMATION ON EMERGENCY STANDING AND IN FACT MORE INFORMATION THAN IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED BY STATUTE. DESPITE THIS FACT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REALLY GONE ABOVE THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATUTE WE STILL THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS MORE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CONDUCT OVERSIGHT. ON PASSAGE WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THE ADMINISTRATION TO NOTIFY IT WHEN. ALLOCATIONS FROM DARIO ARE BEING MADE TO DEPARTMENTS- THIS WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE TIME OF THE ALLOCATION IS TAKING PLACE. AND THE NOTIFICATION WOULD INCLUDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON HOW THE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY GONNA BE YEARS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE MONTHLY REPORTS ON EMERGENCY SPENDING. THIS WOULD BE AN ONGOING REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD APPLY TO ALL EMERGENCIES AND THE MONTHLY REPORT WOULD INCLUDE ALL PLANNED AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY SPENDING BY STATE AT. LEAST INCLUDING EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS FROM THE TRIO OF FEDERAL FUNDS PRIVATE FUNDS AS WELL AS EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS BUDGETED FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR ONES THAT ARE BEING REDIRECTED- FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE BUDGET TOWARDS EMERGENCY RESPONSE. R. AS WELL AS WELL AS SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON HOW THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE IS ARM. SO THE LEGISLATURE WORK TO IMPLEMENT THE REFORMS I OUTLINED ABOVE WE THINK THAT IT COULD BE APPROPRIATE TO APPROVED. CONTROLS ELEVEN POINT ZERO THE ADMIN. TO YEARS ALL THE RULE. I JUST THIS- THROUGH THE BUDGET YEAR PROGRAM NINETEEN HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT- YOU GREATER CAN OVER THE LEVEL OF NAY IT'S- IN ITS- WHAT. COULD BRIDGE CONTROL SUCH ELEVEN NINE TWO AND CREATE A BUDGET CONTROL SECTION. SPECIFIC MICROBE NINETEEN EXTENDED. ARE THIS CONTROL SUCH. RUSSIFIED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE FOR COVERT NOW EXTENDED IN THE BUDGET. AND IN ACROSS TO REQUIRE THE LEAD BEING. BEFORE MONEY IS ALEC FROM CONTROLS TO THE PARTNER. WE WILL THAT THE AMOUNT SPENT ON WHO NINETEEN IN THIS CASE COULD ONLY BE INCREASED WITH AN AMENDMENT TO THE BUDGET ACT. SO AT THIS POINT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS OR OTHER QUESTIONS LEGISLATURE. GREAT THANK YOU- MISS MISTER SODERBERG JUST- SO FISHY YOUR LAST COMMENT BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE THAT IN THERE- BECAUSE WE WHICH I THINK RIO ON- IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR EMERGENCIES BUT I DON'T THINK WE EVER ANTICIPATED AN EMERGENCY THAT WAS GOING TO TOUCH EVERY FACET OF THE STATE AND- COULD BE IT COULD BE USED TO JUSTIFY FRANKLY ANY EXPENDITURE IN THE STATE BUDGET- FOR WELL OVER A YEAR NOW. SO ON. BASED ON THAT CONCERN I THINK WHAT WOULD YOU DID YOU DID YOU LOOK AT- ACTUALLY. DOING A REGULAR SUNSET OF DRILL LAW SAYING INSTEAD OF PRE AUTHORIZING IT FOR JUNE JUST MAYBE AUTHORIZING A FOR EVERY THREE MONTHS OR MORE SO SPECIFIC PERIOD- ORDER OR DID YOU. PREFER YOUR RECOMMENDATION AROUND BUDGET CONTROL SECTION VERSUS SOMETHING THAT WOULD NATURALLY ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO RE AUTHORIZE- THE- CONTROL. FORTY IT. WOULD ON THAT WOULD HAVE BE AN OPTION AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR RECOMMENDATION WE ENVISIONED APPROVING OUR CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE TWO WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE IT FOR THE ENTIRE BUDGET YEAR BUT THERE'S NO REASON THAT TH LEGISLATURE COULDN'T MODIFY THAT AND AUTHORIZE IT FOR A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME THAT'S ABSOLUTELY AN OPTION THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. IS THERE ARE PROS AND CONS TO DOING OF WHAT WERE THE OTHER FROM AND WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT WE WOULD BE THE PRO GOING FOR THE BUDGET CONTROL SECTION. THE PRO OF- IT ON A SHORTER TIME. IT ABOUT WOULD. PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH NATURAL POINTS AWAY IN. ON THE- THE POTENTIAL CON OF THAT WOULD BE IF THE SECTION EXPIRED AT ANY POINT IN TIME WHERE IS DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT ON IT- IT COULD DELAY THE ABILITY OF THE FUNDS TO BE AVAILABLE. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD KNOW IN ADVANCE AND SO ARE THE LEGISLATURE COULD PLANT PLAN AROUND THAT FOR EXAMPLE YOU'D WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE- AUTHORITY TO- USE TRIO IT DIDN'T EXPIRE WHILE THE LEGISLATURE WAS SAY OUT OF SESSION AND- MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RE AUTHORIZE IT. BUT THERE COULD BE WAYS. TO WORK OR TO WORK AROUND THAT. WE'LL SEE FOR THE DID THE YEAR WE KNOW WE AND SO- SEPTEMBER. SO WE COULD. HOW AUTHORS IN THE BUDGET GOING TO HEALTH FIFTEENTH. AND THEN SEEING WHAT. SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT. THAT WOULD ABSOLUTELY- THAT THAT ABSOLUTELY. THAT COULD NOT WORK WELL FOR THE LEGISLATURE GREAT GO GO BACK TO MISTER BENSON- COULD COULD YOU- LET US KNOW WHY YOU CHOSE JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN DOT NINE TWO. I DO ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY THE POINT. I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE THERE IS I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS A REAL FIRM GRASP ON WINDY EMERGENCY WILL AND CERTAINLY BACK WHEN DECEMBER. DECEMBER WHEN THE BUDGET WAS BEING PUT TOGETHER IN PROPOSED THERE WAS EVEN LESS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO TRY AND MAKE. AN EDUCATED ESTIMATE ON THAT SO OUR THOUGHT WAS TO EXTEND IT THROUGH THE BUDGET YEAR I THINK WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO AND RECOGNIZING THAT OUR PROPOSALS HAVE A STARTING POINT WE'RE GOING TO BE GIVING UPDATES IN THE REVISION. WILL HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THAT I THINK OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. CONCOURSE IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY IN THE IN THE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS WHERE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE IS NECESSARY I THINK. WHAT WE WHAT YOU KNOW I HOPE FOLKS RECOGNIZING IS THAT WHEN WE HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING ISSUES LIKE. THE RECENT- RE OPENINGS SAFE YOU KNOW WE THAT WAS DONE THROUGH EARLY ACTION AS OPPOSED TO JUST SOMETHING DOWN THREE THREE OH SO WHEN THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE QUICKLY. BUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY WE TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN USE THOSE APPROPRIATE CHANNELS. I WOULD JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IN CASES WHERE SOMETHING DOES NEED TO GET DONE IMMEDIATELY THE FLEXIBILITY IS THERE TO DO THAT SO AS LONG AS- BACKS ACCOUNTED FOR THAT I THINK WERE YOU CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING HOW TO DO IT. I ALSO WANT TO JUST INCREASE ELIASSON ALSO MEANT THAT. THE MINISTRATION HAS BEEN PROVIDING. I REGULAR UPDATES. AND INFORMATION AND JUST YOU KNOW LOT OF SNOW THAT WE IN. TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING A- AND EVERY TWO MONTHS. GOOD OF OUR UPDATES LOOK AT TO PROVIDE UPDATES THAT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- LEGISLATURE TO C. WERE RAT WAS KIND OF ONE TIME. INS AND ALSO JULIAN ON. INFORMATION IT'S THAT'S AVAILABLE WITH THOSE UPDATES. THANK YOU COULD YOU ALSO ADDRESS I THINK ALEJO'S CONCERNS REGARDING THE- LACK OF DETAILS AS WELL AS THE LACK OF LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION IN THE PROPOSAL. INFRASPECIFIC THE LACK OF DETAILS WHERE THERE IS THIS YOUR FIRST IT DIFFICULT PREPARATIONS TO A LOT OF DEPARTMENTS- ISN'T NOT NOT VERY MUCH DETAIL FRANKLY VERY LITTLE RESTRICTION. AND THEN I GUESS THERE WERE- BUCKETS OF. MONEY OR LABRADOR THERE WERE BUCKETS OF MONEY GOING TO CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS THAT THE L. A. O. NOTICED THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY SPECIFIC ROLE FOR THOSE DEPARTMENTS IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT. WHAT THE FUNDING WAS FOR. YES I THINK WHAT- MISTER SORT BURKE WAS REFERRING TO IS IN CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE THERE ARE THREE DEPARTMENTS LISTED ON OUR LIST OF DEPARTMENTS WERE FUNDING COULD BE TRANSFERRED INTO THAT DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET SO THAT IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE A POT OF MONEY AND WE HAVEN'T IN FIVE WORDS FOR. ITS THAT THERE IS NO PART OF MONEY AND SO I THINK WHAT MR SERVERS TRYING TO REFERENCES THAT SAY WE NEED TO TRANSFER MONEY FROM CDPH TWO OH YES- HIS BIGGEST POINT WAS RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO PROPOSED EXPENDITURE- PRO YES SO WHAT THE MONEY WOULD BE SPENT ON WHEN IT'S TRANSFERRED OVER YES IS WHERE HE FELT IT WAS UNCERTAINTY. OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THE ACTIVITIES THAT EACH OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS WILL BE USING THE FUNDING FOR SO FOR EXAMPLE- YOU D. G. S. THEIR THEIR AMOUNT THAT'S IN THE PROPOSAL TALKS ABOUT SPECIFIC HOTELLING PROGRAMS LIKE THE HOTEL STRUCTURE WORKER PROGRAM. IF FOR SOME REASON WE NEED TO TRANSFER MONEY BACK IN BETTER PREPARATION TO DIFFERENT APARTMENT IT WILL BE BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THE SAME ACTIVITY BUT THE EXPENDITURE NEEDS TO GET MADE BY A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT SAME WOULD APPLY FOR WHEN I WAS A C. P. H. THEIR SPECIFIC AMOUNTS OF PROPOSED FOR CITY PH THAT ARE RELATED TO STAFFING. WORK SEARCH AND GO AS WE UPDATE LIKELY IT WILL INCLUDE STAFFING FOR VACCINATION VACCINATION SITES IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE MONEY. PROGRADE FOR THAT DEPARTMENT IT WOULD BE TO DO THE SAME ACTIVITY BUT IN RECOGNITION THAT A DIFFERENT APARTMENT. IS GOING TO BE MAKING THE EXPENDITURE SO. YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT IS TO BE SPENT ON BECAUSE WE WOULD STILL. ON SAME ACTIVE. IT JUST IT DIRECT.THAT IT BACKS. MAY NEED BE MADE BY INTO. THAT DOES NOT WORK ON. I'M I THINK I THINK IT HAS A THINK THERE STILL- THE LACK OF DETAIL REGARDING THE ONE POINT FOUR LEARN- JOINT DOLLAR EXPENDITURE I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO. PROVED THAT KIND OF APPROPRIATION- GOING INTO A YEAR WHERE WE HOPE THAT WE WILL BE. HOPEFULLY WE HAVE BEEN DOWN A PANDEMIC OR YOU KNOW COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC SO ON. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION YOU KNOW IN MAY REGARDING THAT FINAL NUMBER I THINK WE ARE GOING TO NEED MORE SPECIFIC DETAIL. AND- I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE SUPPORTED AT LEAST IN THIS COMMITTEE- ON THE JUNE THIRTIETH THE DATE IN SELL EITHER- I THINK I WOULD URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT EITHER- A SHORTER TIME FRAME. WHERE THE AVAILABILITY TO RENEW OR MOVING TOWARDS WHAT THE L. L. SUGGEST TO WHICH IS MORE OF A BUNCH OF CONTROL SECTION. ROSS SO ANY OTHER PLEA THE QUESTION MARK COLLEGE. MISTER BONDAGE BROKE SO I THINK WE AGREE WITH YOU SO THE SPECIFIC YOU HAVEN'T FOR OF YOU ARE WILL PREPARED IN THE FOR THE BY I THINK THAT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE RECOVERED WAS VERY DIFFERENT THAN ANSWER THESE RESTAURANTS ARE BASED ON NEEDED LIKE HOSPITAL MEDICAL SURGEON CERTAINLY NEED KNOWLEDGE THAT IN MAY REVISION WE'RE GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY BE ESTIMATED ACTIVITIES AND COSTS FOR ALL OF THOSE AND A BIT OF IT IS WE WOULD MEAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO ANTICIPATE HAVING CAN YOU CAN CONVERSATIONS ON- WHAT SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES. AND THEREFORE ARE SEPARATELY BOTH THOSE ACTIVITIES AND I AGREE I APPRECIATE THAT KNOWLEDGE MAY I JUST WOULD URGE YOU- GIVEN THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC- THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE GREATER LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND MORE LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER THE EXPENDITURES AND SO- I REALLY WOULD URGE THAT THAT FEEDBACK TO. IN. THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO HANDLE THREE IS AN ON FEDERAL FUNDS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE RESCUE PLAN AMOUNTS BUT I EVERY WHO'S SPEAKING OF THE COULD PLEASE MUTE ONLINE. WE WILL NOW GO- THIS GOING AHEAD WITH LEO. THANK YOU MISTER SHE CARE AND HOLLINGSHEAD OF LETTERS ANALYST OFFICE. I MAY BE SPEAKING YOU-TODAY FROM HANDOUT YOU SHOULD IN FRONT OF YOU- AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FOLLOWING- REMOTELY YOU CAN FIND OUR HAND OUT AT ILIO DOT CA DOC OF. I'M SO I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE A PRETTY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AND IN PARTICULAR- THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA- SO I HAVE THREE DIFFERENT PARTS TO MY PRESENTATION FIRST ALL TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE. SORT OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE AND IN PARTICULAR PLACES WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME COICES. ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE FEDERAL FUNDING. SECOND I'M GONNA DISCUSS. THE FUNDING THAT IS GOING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY TO INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES IN THE SALE TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF FUNDING THERE. AND THEN FINALLY ALL DISCUSS- SOME PROGRAMMATIC AMOUNTS- IT AND IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE LARGER DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT ARE GOING TO. SOME STATE PROGRAMS. SO WITH THAT I WILL TURN TO THE FIRST PAGE. SO V. LATELY MOST MAJOR ISSUE FOR- THE LEGISLATURE AS A RESULT OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN KIND OF THE AREA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE THE MOST CHOICES TO MAKE IS ABOUT THE ROUGHLY TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL RELIEF FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED AS PART OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN OR OR ALSO KNOWN AS A. R. P. THIS MONEY IS. RELATIVELY DISCRETIONARY THE LEGISLATURE DOESHAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN HOW IT CAN BE USED BUT THERE ARE KIND OF FOUR BUCKETS- THAT THE FUNDS HAVE TO FALL INTO SO THE FIRST IS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE USED FOR- CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE EITHER YOU KNOW DIRECTLY LIKE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY RELATED STUFF OR- INDIRECTLY- SUCH AS RESPONDING TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF KOBE NINETEEN. THE SECOND IS THAT THE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO BACKFILL REVENUE LOSSES AND THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. THIRD OF THE FUNDS CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ESSENTIAL WORK AND FOR THE FUNDS CAN BE USED- FOR UTILITY TYPE EXPENDITURES TO- FOR WATER SEWER AND BROADBAND THOSE KINDS OF UPGRADES- THERE ARE TWO NOTABLE RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS. FIRST OF ALL- IF THE STATE ACCEPTS THE FUNDS THAT ESSENTIALLY AGREES NOT TO USE THEM TO REDUCE TAXES AND- WE'RE STILL WAITING ACTUALLY FOR SOME TREASURY GUIDANCE AROUND THERE- KIND OF EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHAT THE DIFFERENT- RESTRICTIONS WILL BE THERE SO RIGHT NOW WE KIND OF ONLY HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT THIS RESTRICTION IS BUT ONCE WE HAVE MORE TO MORE GUIDANCE FROM THE U. S. TREASURY WILL. WELL NO MORE AND- THE SECOND RESTRICTION IS THAT THEY CANNOT BE USED THE FUNDS. CANNOT BE USED FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS. THERE GOING TO BE A BILL UNTIL THE- TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE SPENT IN THIS BUDGET YEAR EVEN NEXT BUDGET YEAR- THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE OVER THAT MULTI OR PER. I'M NOT YEAR PERIOD TO THE LEGISLATURE HAS ACTUALLY A GOOD AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY THERE- SECOND IN FISCAL RELIEF TO THE STATE. THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO GO DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL GVERNMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ALL COUNTIES AND CITIES WITH POPULATIONS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND WILL RECEIVE THEIR FUNDS DIRECTLY FROM THE FUNDS. AND THAT AND THOSE CITIES WITH POPULATIONS LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND WILL GET THEIR ALLOCATIONS INDIRECTLY TO THE STATE WILL GET THE MONEY FIRST AND THEN IT'LL DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS TO THE CITY'S- BUT THE LEGISLATURE WON'T HAVE DISCRETION THERE THE FUNDS WILL HAVE TO BE ALLOCATED ACCORDING TO A FORMULA PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO THEN THE SECOND CATEGORY IS RELATED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- B. A. R. P. PROVIDED ABOUT. THESE ARE ESTIMATES- SO THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE STILL SUBJECT TO CHANGE BUT ABOUT TWO POINT TWO BILLION. FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE WHICH IS SORT OF A CONTINUATION OF THE FUNDS. THAT WERE PROVIDED IN DECEMBER THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY ALLOCATED IN EARLY ACTION AND THEN ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN HOMEOWNERS ASSISTANCE- BUT WHICH ARE FUNDS THAT WOULD. GO TO QUALIFYING HOMEOWNERS AREN'T TO HELP OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS UTILITIES PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS AT THAT TRACK. SO THOSE MONIES- THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY IN IN DETERMINING HOW THEY'RE- HOW THEY'RE ALLOCATED. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS. THOSE SORT OF SUPPORTING THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC- SO. DO REMOTE WORK SCHOOL AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AND SO AN EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE LIKE USING THE MONEY FOR BROADBAND- AND OTHER SIMILAR PROCESS. FROM SO TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE ON MAJOR SYSTEMS CATEGORIES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES. THESE ARE REALLY JUST THE LARGEST FUNDING AMOUNTS THAT- WE ARE VERY ROUGHLY ESTIMATING AT THE FEDS ARE GOING TO DIRECT YOU CALIFORNIANS DIRECTLY IF THE LEGISLATURE WON'T HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY AT ALL IN THESE ITEMS. I'M THERE'S AN ESTIMATED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSION OF THE ENHANCED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- AND THAT IS AGAIN OVER A VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE BUT BUT- WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IT THERE'S THIRTY FIVE BILLION ESTIMATE FOR CASH ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS THESE ARE THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECKS THAT MOST QUALIFYING TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE. THERE'S ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS GOING TO CALIFORNIANS AS A RESULT OF THE I. T. SKI THE CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT AND THE CHILD TAX CREDIT EXPANSIONS- AND THEN FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN BUSINESS SUPPORT WHICH WILL MOSTLY FOCUS ON THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. TURNING TO THE THIRD AND FINAL- TEXT PAGE OF THIS HANDOUT. THE PROGRAMMATIC FUNDING AMOUNTS THERE'S NEARLY SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S GOING TO GO TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND THIS IS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS THAT ALSO TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT LEARNING LOSS- THAT HAS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. FIVE OF HIGHER EDUCATION ABOUT HALF FOR EMERGENCY GRANTS- FOR STUDENTS AND THAT ABOUT HALF FOR CAMPUS OPERATIONS- TO BACKFILL REVENUE LOSSES AND THEN TO MAINTAIN CAMPUS- CAMPUS OPERATIONS. NEARLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR A VARIETY OF PUBLIC HEALTH- INITIATIVES ARE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS NUMBER PARTICULAR CONTINUES TO CHANGE AS WE GOT. ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- BUT THIS IS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINE- AND THEN ALSO CONTINUE TO TESTING CONTACT TRACING ITS ULTRA. FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO TRANSIT AGENCIES AGAIN TO BACK FILL REVENUE LOSSES MOSTLY- AND THEN IT NEARLY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO CHILD CARE AND HEAD START PROVIDERS- THAT- WITH THE INTENT OF SERVICE CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON OPERATIONS- SUPPORT PAYROLL EXPENDITURES FOR EXAMPLE OR OR- RENT AND MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. SO THE LAST COUPLE PAGES OF THE HAND OUT- JUST HAVE A FEW TABLES WHERE WE'VE TRIED TO SUMMARIZE THE TOTAL- THE TOTAL AMOUNT EIGHT KIND OF FROM THE LARGEST BUCKETS OF FEDERAL RELIEF SO THIS IS. IN GENERALLY SPEAKING ITEMS THAT ARE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT THAT ISN'T INCLUDED IN THIS TABLE SO IT'S DEFINITELY NOT COMPREHENSIVE- BUT WE WANT TO TRY TO GET AS MUCH ON THIS LIST AS WE COULD- AND SO IT'S DIVIDED BY THE% ENTITY THAT IS GOING TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING- AND THEN DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDING OR OR JUST RECEIVE IT TO USE. THE DESCRIPTION AND THEN AT THE POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE ROLE I'M SO HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS OR- KNOWER AND WHATEVER TO PROGRAM. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO MICHELLE THàNH FROM FINANCE. HEY KRISTIN SHELTON FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I THINK THE L. A. O. DID A REALLY NICE JB OF PROVIDING A BROAD BRUSH OVERVIEW FOR YOU ON AND THE ESTIMATES RAIL RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL- I'M AT AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. AND WE ARE ALSO DOING THE SAME COMPILATION OUR NUMBERS ARE VERY VERY COMPARABLE TO THE LEDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE FROM A PRELIMINARY STANDPOINT- NEW GUIDANCE COMES OUT EVERY DAY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AN UPDATE- DURING THAT TIME FRAME AS AS THAT DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY. MR TRUMP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MAYBE THIS COULD BE THE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE DEPARTMENT FINANCER OR WHAT THE L. A. L. L. I WANT TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THIS THE GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF THE USE FOR- SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF- CERTAINLY AS A LEGISLATURE WHERE WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH TRYING TO GET PPP CONFORMITY- DONE- IT WAS KIND OF ON TRACK AND THEN IT WILL. IN AND NOW IT'S NOT HEY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MORE CLARITY- CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PACIFIC SPECIFIC ISSUE IS THAT THAT THE STATE HAS THE USE STATE FUNDS AND THEN I CAN'T USE THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE COMING TO THE STATE TO DO THAT- AS YOU CAN. AS YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW YOU ALREADY KNOW THE DEADLINE JUST RECENTLY PASSED THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY- YEAH WE WERE TRYING TO GET THIS COMPLETED BEFORE THAT THE FILING DEADLINE SO CAN YOU HE SAID SOME LIGHT AND SO. THAT THE THINKING AT WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. SURE CHRIS SCHULTZ AGAIN AND SO FIRST WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS WE CERTAINLY FAIR SHARE YOUR CONCERN- RELATIVE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE LANGUAGE IS CRAFTED. AND WE ARE STILL KIND OF ASSESSING WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN- BUT KIND OF A BOTTOM LINE THAT IF- THE- TREASURY GUIDANCE DOES NOT GIVE ANY KIND OF FLEXIBILITY AROUND. ITEMS RELATED TO CONFORMITY. IT WOULD. IT WOULD BASICALLY BE TWICE THE COST OF WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY BEING CONTEMPLATED AND DELIBERATED BY THE LEGISLATURE SO. THE VALUE OF THAT TAX CONFORMITY WOULD ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT AT THE TWENTY SIX BILLION LEDGER ANALYST MENTIONED. THAT WOULD COME TO THE STATE SO. THAT WOULD BE. KIND OF TO IMPACTS- WE- WE ARE OBVIOUSLY- WORKING CAREFULLY AND CLOSELY TO- TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT UNCERTAINTY. WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT AND CERTAINTY IS. GOING TO BE INTERPRETED THE SAME WAY- AS- AND KIND OF IT MAY LOOK ON THE SURFACE SO REALLY. IS GOING TO DEPEND ON THEIR INTERPRETATION AT THE TREASURY LEVEL. WHAT OPTIONS AND THE STATE HAS RELATIVE TO THE USE OF THE FUNDS. AND WE'RE REALLY HOPING TO GET MORE CLARITY THROUGH THAT FEDERAL GUIDANCE IN THE COMING WEEKS AND ARE WORKING WITH. OUR CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS TO KIND OF FRAME OUR CONCERNS- AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE ACROSS MANY STATES. INCLUDING THOSE THAT AUTOMATICALLY. CONFORM TO SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS. CAN YOU YOU EXPLAIN HOW HOW WOULD IT DOUBLE THE COST. OF THE- OF THE PROPOSAL. SURE SO AND THAT YOU WOULD TAKE YOU WITH AND HAVE THE REVENUE REDUCTION THAT WAS CONTEMPLATED- THROUGH NOT CONFORMING SO THAT THAT WOULD BE AN IMPACT ON THE REVENUE SIDE AND THEN THE TWENTY SIX BILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED FOR CALIFORNIA OR IS ESTIMATED FOR CALIFORNIA IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN WOULD GET REDUCED BY AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT. SO TO THE I GUESS THEN THE NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE. IF WE WERE TO USE THE STATE. WINDFALL AND NOT ACCESS THE ARE NOT UTILIZED TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO DO CONFORMITY IS THAT ALLOWED. I WOULD PRESUME THAT IT IS IT IS IT'S NOT ACTUALLY. SURE SORRY ABOUT THAT- IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT AND USING THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS IT'S MORE THE PERCEPTION THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS IS PROVIDING- RELIEF TO. ALL GOVERNMENTS AND THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD THEN BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE ACT TAX CUTS THE GENERAL FUND- UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SOME OF THE FEDERAL THINKING WAS AT THE TIME THAT BILL WAS PASSED. AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE STRUCTURED VERY DIFFERENTLY AND NOT TAKE THE SHAPE OF A TAX REDUCTION OR REVENUE PRODUCTION TO BE ABLE TO- IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T HAVE THAT DOUBLE AND- IMPACT AND WHAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS THAT. YOU KNOW IDEALLY WHAT WE WOULD DO IS WORK WITH THE TREASURY AND GET MORE CLARITY ON WHETHER THE PROVISIONS THAT WERE ENACTED R. AS RESTRICT AS THEY MIGHT BE BEING PERCEIVED AT THIS POINT SO I THINK FIRST STEP IS TO WORK WITH. US TREASURY AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. TO GET MORE CLARITY AROUND THE ISSUE. I GUESS I AM I BY APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THERE IS THERE. REMAINING FUNDS IN THE STATE SURPLUS TO DO CONFORMITY THAT WOULD AND SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO UTILIZE. THE FEDERAL FUNDS I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S A BETTER QUESTION TO ASK. I AM SO YOU WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT INSTEAD OF REVENUE RELIEF AND AN EXPENDITURE THAT WOULD PROVIDE COMPARABLE OR SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF RELIEF TO THOSE BUSINESSES ADAM RIGHT TO TAKE THAT THE CAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TO TAKE FUNDING IN THE STATE. THE STATE SURPLUS NOT INTERVIEWS THE TO USE THAT FOR CONFORMITY AND I THINK THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT RIGHT I THINK I THINK MY COLLEAGUE IS ASKING- IF WE UTILIZE. THE STATE'S MONEY. FOR THE- RELIEF- WOULD THAT BE ALLOWABLE AND I THINK I THINK MIGHT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT IF WE DID DO THAT RENO TAX RELIEF THROUGH DOES MATTER IT'S ALL IT'S ALL IT'S ALL IT OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND- DAD MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT OUR ALLOCATION FROM THE FEDERAL% GOVERNMENT WOULD BE REDUCED COMMENSURATELY SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF IT WAS YOU KNOW SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF TAX RELIEF WE WOULD LOSE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN RECOVERYFUNDS FROM. WASHINGTON OKAY THAT'S IT YEAH SO IS IT IS IT JUST THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING RELIEF THAT THAT'S WHAT'S THE TRIGGER TO REDUCE. THE AMOUNT FROM THE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOT NOT HOW WE USE THAT RECORD NOT APPLYING THE MONEY TO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. YEAH THE MAIN TRIGGER IS- I'M TAKING IMPLEMENTING A LAW IN CALIFORNIA AFTER MARCH THIRD THAT HAS A NET REDUCTION IN THE STATE'S OVERALL REVENUE I'M FRAMEWORK SO. AND EVEN AND THIS IS A CAN ASSIST POTENTIAL SO WE DON'T KNOW WITH CERTAINTY AS YACHTS AND- THE GUIDANCE IS GOING TO BE FRAMED BUT IF YOU DO SO AND THEN IT HAS THOSE PENALTY KIND OF. BUILT INTO IT SO IF YOU DON'T DO THAT THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE PENALTY- BUT IF THERE IF THERE IS A REVENUE ACTION THAT WOULD CAUSE THE REDUCTION AND I IN CAN BE CASH THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO US SALAS I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR. CLARIFYING SO IT'S NOT THAT THE USE OF THE IT'S NOT HELD THEM WHICH WHICH- WHERE THE FUNDS COME FROM IT'S THE ACTUAL ACTION OF DOING. TAX RELIEF THAT IS CREATING V. THE UNCERTAINTY OR THAT THAT NEEDS CLARITY IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE TO SAY. YES THE WAY IN WHICH THE FEDERAL STATUTE WAS FRAMED IS CREATING THE UNCERTAINTY I AM I THINK YOU KNOW BRADLEY IT IS OUR INTENT TO ULTIMATELY USE GENERAL FUND TO DO SOMETHING IN THAT- THE REAL QUESTION IS ABOUT THE APPROACH AT THIS TIME AND TELEMARKETER. THIS ISSUE I JUST GOT OFF AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WE JUST DID SO WE PROVIDED- A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF- TAX AND FEE RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES AT THE SAME TIME WE DID. ALSO A TWO BILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM SO BASED BASED ON OUR INITIAL READING I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS WHAT THE FINAL READING WILL BE BASED ON THIS INITIAL READING. THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM WHERE WE ARE AGAIN EXPANDING MONEY. WOULD SEEM TO BE AN APPROPRIATE USE OF FUNDS WILL ALLOW THE USE OF FUNDS. BUT THE- FEE AND THE TAX REDUCTION WHICH IS A REVENUE REDUCTION. WOULD NOT BE IS THAT IS OUT OF. FAIR COMPARISON I GUESS I'M A FINANCE EARLIER. YES THE STATE WOULD HAVE MUCH MORE LATITUDE IN TERMS OF HOW WE STRUCTURE THE GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK THERE'S IN FACT BROAD. FLEXIBILITY IN THE FORT CARE ACT CATEGORIES THAT THE LEGEND ALMOST DESCRIBED RELATIVE TO PROVIDING KIND OF GRANTS AND ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND OTHERS AFFECTED BY KOPEN. SO I I'VE I'VE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THIS YEAR'S- EXAMPLE AYE AYE IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. TO BE ABLE TO HAMSTRING A STATE'S ABILITY TO DO TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS OR DID TO DICTATE OUR OWN TAX POLICY TO PROVIDE RELIEF. TO OF ALL THINGS TO SMALL BUSINESSES STRUGGLING TO THE PANDEMIC THAT WOULD BE THE ONE THING I WOULD THINK THAT THE FUNDS SHOULD BE USED FOR. IS TO ACTUALLY HELP SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY WHEN I DON'T THINK THE CITY CALIFORNIA I DON'T BELIEVE THE POSITION OF THE ADMINISTRATION. IS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE GENERATING REVENUE ON EMERGENCY RELIEF PROVIDED THE PPP LANDS AND MY- I'M AGAIN I WOULD HOPE THE GOVERNOR WOULD SHARE THAT POSITION. IS THAT IS THAT TRUE. CERTAINLY I THINK GIVEN THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE COLLECTIVELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND GOD THAT IS NOT AN ACCURATE. SO THE SO THE GOAL IS OBVIOUSLY TO DO P. B. P. CONFORMITY BUT WE'RE TRYING TO GET CLARITY ON WHETHER WE CAN DO IT. WITH THIS LAW BEING PASSED IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION RIGHT NOW ABOUT AND WHAT WHAT IT MEANS EXACTLY RELATIVES OF THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE BUT I THINK THAT THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO SPARE. SO I AND I GUESS THIS IS THE HYPOTHETICAL BUT I'LL HAVE TO ASK IT BUT INSTEAD GAVE IF THE LAW IS CLEAR THAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO DO IT. WOULD WE APPEAL THAT IT WOULD BE WOULD WE SUPPORT LEGISLATION- TO TRY TO ALLOW US TO DO THAT. WELL THAT'S IT SO. RIGHT SO OUR OUR FIRST- KIND OF EFFORTS- WHICH ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY ARE SEEKING ADDITIONAL CLARITY RELATIVE TO THE GUIDANCE AND WE ARE WORKING AGAIN THROUGH VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ARE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION I'M BACK IN WASHINGTON DC TO FRAME OUR CONCERNS HIGHLIGHT WHERE THERE IS CLARITY NEEDED- FOCUSING ON THE DISPARITY BETWEEN STATES THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CONFORM TO FEDERAL TAX- CHANGES VERSUS STATES THAT HAVE TO KIND OF PRO ACTIVELY TAKE A STAB AND IMPLEMENT- STATUTORY CHANGES TO DO SO WE THINK IT YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS BIG. DISPARITY IT IT IS UNCLEAR THAT THAT WAS THE INTENT IT'S JUST THAT- IN IN DRAFTING I THINK THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO SOLVE ONE PROBLEM AND PERHAPS CREATED A DIFFERENT PROBLEM FOR STATES AND SO WE'RE WORKING AND TIRELESSLY TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK CLARITY AND- HELP TO GET IT AND THE COMING WEEKS. THIS ONLY RAISES A LOT OF CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS TO- WHICH I KNOW A LOT OF OTHER STATES ARE PROBABLY GOING TO EXAMINE I HOPE THAT WE WOULD JOIN- THOSE- THOSE THOSE LEGAL- EFFORTS TO IF NECESSARY- DO YOU HAVE A TIME LINE IN TERMS OF WHEN WE WOULD GET THAT CLARITY I MEAN I KNOW THAT A LOT OF FOLKS OF ASK FOR EXTENSIONS BECAUSE MONDAY WAS- THE TAX DEADLINE- SO. IF YOU DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHEN WE WOULD GET THAT TYPE OF CLARITY SO SAID THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES COULD. PLANT A PATH FORWARD. WE HAVE NO. NO SIGN ARE. WHEN THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE WILL BE ISSUED WE DO NOTE THAT THE ALLOCATIONS HAVE A DEADLINE WITHIN THE- AMERICAN RESCUE PLANNED- WHICH IS SIXTY DAYS FROM THE DATE OF AN ENACTMENT DOT DOT IS THE ONLY THING WE DO KNOW- RELATIVE TO WHAT. WHAT STEPS WHAT TIMELINE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PURSUE THEIR OKAY- I JUST WANNA GET UP IN THE L. A. O. DID DID THAT IF THE IF THEY WANTED TO OPINE ON THIS ISSUE. AND DO YOU HAVE A- PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. RIGHT NOW I THINK I WOULD JUST ECHO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COMMENTS THAT WE- WE TWO WERE EAGERLY AWAITING THE U. S. TREASURY GUIDANCE- AND ARE CAREFULLY MONITORING THE SITUATION- IT TO. THE TOP OF THE TUBE TRANSITION TO THEM TO THE L. A. O. AND TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THE IN YOUR- AND YOUR ANALYSIS IS JUST FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS. YOU KIND OF. BREAK THAT DOWN A BIT MORE IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE PROJECTS WOULD BE. HELLO ARE ELIGIBLE TO DO IT IS IN EDUCATION HEALTH MONITORING IT DOES A VERY BROAD WORK I MEAN IT'S VERY BROAD ARRAY BROAD BUCKETS. THE OTHER LANGUAGE APPEARS RELATIVELY FLEXIBLE AGAIN I THINK WE'RE GONNA WAIT FOR MORE GUIDANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE OR FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY- THE BY BUT IT DOES HAVE TO BE SORT OF TANGENTIALLY RELATED TO CORONA VIRUS SO EXAMPLES ARE- BROADBAND OR UPGRADES CHIU- HEALTH- I. T. SYSTEMS. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE BUT THEN YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY EXAMPLES OF OTHER YOU KNOW KIND OF MORE BROADER CAPITAL OUTLAY KIND OF PROJECTS THAT COULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WERE YOU KNOW CAN HAVE TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO EXPLORE. OKAY AND THEN IN TERMS OF. THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE THE SERVICES THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDS ARE GOING DIRECTLY TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES CAN YOU IS ARE THERE TO THOSE FUNDS OF THE USE FOR PARTICULAR THINGS WHEN IT COMES ADVOCATION. HI MY COLLEAGUE EDGAR CABRAL HERE AND I THINK THAT HE'D BE BEST SUITED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I'M GOING THE POINT IF THE FUNDING OVERALL- FIFTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION. MOST OF THE ACT OF THIRTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS- RETALIATES ACCORDING TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. BASED ON THE TITLE ONE FORMULA THIS IS THE FINGERPRINTS THAT DONALD GENERAL. THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF FUNDING HAD DONE SO BROWN'S BUDGET OPENING IT'S GOING DIRECTLY. TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS A MALPRACTICE PROVIDING YOU GET UNDER THE PARAMETERS WHICH ARE. ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING RELATED TO SCHOOL RE OPENING LEARNING OFF ISSUES- AND THEN ANY SORT OF FEDERALLY RELATED PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL STUDENTS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THERE IS A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION SO 10% OF THE TOTAL PART OF THAT BUT THE BIGGEST CHUNK IS. IT'S SORT OF LIKE A STATE. NO PROBLEM MOST ABOUT IT HAS TO BE SPENT HUNDREDS FROM SOME RESTRICTIONS. I'M HALF OF THAT HAVE TO BE SPENT FOR EARLY LOS ACTIVITIES. AND THEN- WHAT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS TO BE USED FOR SUMMER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS AND THEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR. COMPREHENSIVE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY FROM THE STATE IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WANT TO STRUCTURE ARE YOU WANT TO USE IT BUT- BUT THAT'S- RESTRICTIONS THERE ARE TONS OF USED. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT FROM PREVIOUS- OUR PREVIOUS ARE AROUND THE FUNDING WHERE THE STATE COMING WITH QUICKLY. BENEFITS THE LEAVE ARM ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY ONE DOLLARS. THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE MORE DISCUSS FOR DECIDING HOW TO USE. THIS IS SO CAN I ASK HOW DOES. THIS ADDITIONAL SO. FUNDS HOW DOES IT INTERACT. THE RECENT ACTIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF. IN PERSON LEARNING AND LEARNING AND ADDRESSING LEARNING LOTS OF ACTIVITIES THAT THE STATE DID IS IT IS IT ON. IT ON TOP. OF HOW DID HOW DO THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. IMAGINE THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT 20% OF THE FUNDING THAT IS DISTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO LOCALS TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS GOING TO BE USED FOR MY LEARNING OFF ACTIVITIES SO THERE WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE THAT THEY COULD BE USE THOSE PURPOSES THE PERFORMING WHILE A FEW MORE YEARS A BIG IN IN- THE TIMING ALLOWS- SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS BEEN OUT OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES. AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTICE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION FORMULA WITH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF THE FEDERAL FORMULA WHICH IS USUALLY THE TITLE ONE FORMULA IS NOT PROVIDES A SUBSTANTIALLY MORE FUNDING FOR WORK- SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS IT'S NOT. THE STATE FUNDING WAS DISTRIBUTED VIA OF THE ACROPOLIS ALSO DOES PROVIDE FROM ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY MEMBERS WOULD NOT CONSIDER BECAUSE WE'RE BUT THE FUNDING IF. PROVIDER A GREATER DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE LOWER- HI INCOME AND LOWER SCHOOLS. OKAY SO THE FIRST THE FUNDING STREAMS ARE DEAF BUT IT TO THE C. AREA SO IN PER LEARNING LEARNING LAW SO THIS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE DID. FOLLOW THE DIFFERENT FORMS AND DID PAD. IT'S GOES TO THE SAME. ISSUE EVERY OPENING SCHOOL AND LEARN LAWCENTER ELSE. AND IF I DON'T. YES IN THE CATEGORIES ARE BROKEN UP BECAUSE- WE KNOW THAT IT'LL BE SIX OH ARE REQUIRED THAT. THE SECOND ROUND OF FEDERAL AND THE DVDS IT'S TO BE A- REGARDING HOW TO USE THE FUNDS I THINK IT WELCOME USED ON THURSDAY DIFFERENCES IMPOSSIBLE CATEGORY ARE IN SOME. RESTRICTIONS THEY ARE IN OF THOSE CATEGORIES THAT YOU MAY THAT OF THE CAN. TO PLAN INTO ONE OUT. THE FUNDING OVER THE NEXT YEAR. AND THE ASSISTANCE AND THE REST SYSTEM- THE LEGISLATURE HAD ACTED AS WELL AND AN ESTABLISHED- OF THOSE OF. ITS OWN SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE AN IN ADDITION TO A WHAT OTHER LOCAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING. DOES THAT MONEY. IS THAT MONEY GOING INTO THE SAME. THE POT THANK YOU THE MONEY THAT WAY. GOOD FOR YOU JUST GATED HANSON WE ARE DID OR- WITH THIS WOULD THE- LEGISLATIVE TAKE. SEPARATE ACTION AGAIN DID THIS THIS MONEY. AND ON HOMEOWNERS DISTANCE AND- AND THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE. YES I AM CALLING SAID LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- YES THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE SEPARATE ACTION- TO ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS BUT THEY ARE THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE IN PARTICULAR IS VERY SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF WHAT THE FUNDING WAS PROVIDED FOR IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT WAS PROVIDED IN DECEMBER THAT YES AS YOU NOTED. OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED SO- IF LEGISLATOR WANTED TO USE A SIMILAR SYSTEM IT COULD OR A DIFFERENT SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO HOMEOWNERS ASSISTANCE- IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN. THAN WHAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED. OKAY OTHER WHAT ARE THE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS TO THIS DECISION MONEY ARE THERE ANY BUDGET IMPLICATIONS FOR US AND MAKE IT A CALL BACKS IS THERE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS STRINGS ATTACHED TO THESE THAT THESE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF. TO THE HOMELESSNESS AND HARMONICIST I'M JUST IN GENERAL IN GENERAL BUT I GUESS YOU COULD WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT IS THE TWENTY SIX BILLION IN THE RECOVERY BUT IF THERE ARE OTHER. STRINGS I GUESS. WE APPRECIATE THAT. INFORMATION HE ADDED SIX BILLION IS THE AMOUNT THAT HAS THE MOST DIRECT SORT OF FISCAL OR BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE I MEAN I THINK THE QUESTION IS STILL AROUND. HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO REPLACE START OF EXISTING EXPENDITURES- FOR THE STATE AND PROVIDE FISCAL RESPONSE THIS GOAL- FLEXIBILITY AND NOT RESPECT OR HOW MUCH OF IT IS BASICALLY JUST GONNA HAVE TO BE SPENT ON NEW PURPOSES- GIVEN THAT B. R. REVENUE LOSSES ARE DEFINED RELATIVE TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I THINK WE STILL HAVE TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL. WHAT YOU KNOW OR IS THIS ALL FUNDS IT JUST GENERAL FUND FOR EXAMPLE- IT'S THAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF KEY CRITERIA WHERE THERE WOULD BE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ON THE STATE TO USE THE FUNDS IN A WAY THAT YOU KNOW SORT OF SUPPLANTED EXISTING EXPENDITURES AS OPPOSED TO JUST BEING A SUPPLEMENTAL AMOUNT- AND GIVEN THAT THE THAT THE STATE'S REVENUE PERFORMANCE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY. FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE ABOVE THE PRE PANDEMIC LEVEL AND THEN IT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE THAT THE STATE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF USE THAT MECHANISM THAT VERY MUCH SO. THERE'S STILL KIND OF QUESTIONS AROUND HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE KIND OF. FISCAL RELIEF IN THE SENSE THAT YOU WOULD THINK- IT IS KIND OF A SUB PLANTATION OF FEDERAL OF- EXISTING STATE EXPENDITURES VERSUS MORE OF A SUPPLEMENTAL. PAYMENT WHERE THE STATE HAS YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY ESSENTIALLY TO SPEND THE MONEY ON NEW PURPOSES. OKAY AND THEN OF COURSE- THAT WITH THE NOT BARRING THAT THE CLARITY THAT WE NEED FOR THE RELIEF I GUESS THAT'S THAT THE OTHER BIG- DIED IN THAT WE NEED TO GET. A ANSWER ON YES. YES YES. I THINK WE'RE MUCH. THANKS FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. NO GREAT REALLY VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION FROM LA- INFO FROM THE FINANCE SOUNDS LIKE WE STILL HAVE QUITE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED ANSWERED AND WILL BE ON EAGERLY AWAITING- GREATER FEDERAL GUIDANCE SO WITH THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO PUBLIC COMMENT DOES ANY PUBLIC HERE IN THE ROOM WHICH CAN ACCOMMODATE. PLEASE STEP FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE. GO AHEAD AND START. I NEED MY GLASSES I FIVE EXTRA SECONDS WOULD HELP ME YOUR SUPPORT LINE TO CONTROLLED VACCINE INJURED WOMAN WHO KEEPS COMING BACK.

WAY EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION VACCINES TO AMERICANS IN WHAT HEALTH OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE IS A POPULATION WIDE EXPERIMENT. HHS REGULATORS JUSTIFIED THE SHORT CUT BY PROMISING TO IMPLEMENT A POST LICENSING SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM THAT WOULD DETECT VACCINE INJURIES AND ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES PHYSICIANS AND AMERICANS TO UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND BENEFITS FOR EACH OF THE VARIOUS VACCINES HOWEVER HHS OFFICIALS ARE INSTEAD ADOPTING PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO HIDE COALBED VACCINE INJURIES PARTICULARLY DEATH. FOR THE PUBLIC TO OBSCURE SAFETY AND RISK PROFILES. THIS IS NOT A VACCINE YOU ARE EXPERIMENTING ON CALIFORNIANS AND YOU KNOW THE TRUTH AND YOU'RE STILL DOING ACT. PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THIS STATE.
