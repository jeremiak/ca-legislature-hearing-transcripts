GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE WORKING TO GET STARTED I KNOW COUPLE OF MEMBERS ARE GOING TO BE DROPPING IN A BIT LATE. SO FEW OTHERS HAVE ALREADY COME FROM THERE ATTENDANCE. AND DOT SO THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO. WHAT WILL BE OUR SECOND THAT DON'T LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES? I AM ASSEMBLYMEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE AND DUH BELIEVE OF. HENRY STERN NOW IS THE VICE CHAIR NUBIAN. IN A FEW MINUTES A YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF THE AGENDA. AND I'LL START WITH TO SOME OPENING REMARKS AT GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THIS INFORMATION HEARING ON THE URBAN FORESTRY. AND URBAN GREENING PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. AS ONE OF THE LEGISLATORS IN AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE AS WELL INVOLVED IN THE PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL FIVE. LAST YEAR I BELIEVE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE HEALTHY AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHY WE INCLUDED URBAN FORESTRY IN URBAN GREENING IN THE FINAL PART BOND. I LAST YEAR. BECAUSE IT A MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE PARTICULARLY IN OUR DISADVANTAGE IN LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THE VISION OF FOR THAT BOND HAS NEVER BEEN. TO REPLACE THE CLIMATE INVESTMENTS FOR THESE PROGRAMS BUT TO ADD ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OUR TO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO. WILL HIGHLIGHT AND EMPHASIZE THAT TODAY OR AS A SIMPLETON WOULD SAY UNDERSCORE. HIGHLIGHT. YOU KNOW ALL THAT. ALL OF THOSE THAT TERMINOLOGY CITY USE THAT THAT THAT. HOW HAPPY TO SEE RECENT GROUNDBREAKING EVENTS IN MY OWN DISTRICT GOD THAT WERE FUNDED BY THESE PROGRAMS IN NORTH SHORE? THIS THE COMMUNITY OF NORTH SHORE THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST PARK EVER BUILT IN THAT COMMUNITY OUT BY THE SALTON SEA IN THE CITY OF EL CENTRO. THAT FOR MANY YEARS HAS BEEN LACKING IN PARK. A GREAT AND OF COURSE. SERVING THE COMMUNITIES IN THAT AREA BOTH RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BUILD THE PARKS. IF IT WASN'T FOR THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS WE ARE SEEING SMALL INVESTMENTS MAKE BIG CHANGES FOR COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. WHOEVER IS CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRESSES WE WILL BE INCREASINGLY RELIANT ON GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACTS. OF INCREASED BUILDING ENERGY DEMANDS AND INCONSISTENT WATER SUPPLIES AND URBAN HEAT. ISLAND EFFECT TODAY WE ARE HERE TO FOCUS ON THE INVESTMENTS FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND OUR GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THESE PREVIOUS BUDGET ALLOCATIONS WHERE THE PROGRAM'S KURDISTAN AND WHAT IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS ARE HAVING ON OUR STATES CLIMATE GOALS? I'M VERY PLEASED THAT WE HAVE SUCH AN ARRAY OF EXPERTS ON THESE PROGRAMS HERE WITH US TODAY. AND I KNOW. I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL TO JOIN US AT THE TABLE AND TURNED IT OVER. ATTIRE VICE CHAIR WHO'S NOT HERE HE WILL BE HERE. FOR OPENING COMMENTS WHEN HE GETS HERE HASSELBLAD. BUT I THE FIRST PANEL COME UP. AND DOUBLE JUMP RIGHT IN. SO MY NAME IS HAL YANG I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR. DEPARTMENT FOR DOWN FIRE PROTECTION CAL FIRE. AND THE. I LIKE TO COVER. COUPLE THINGS TODAY JUST AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM FIRST AND THEN THE COUPLE. OF EXAMPLES OF THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA'S URBAN A COMMUNITY FORCE YOUR PROGRAM THAT WAS CREATED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE URBAN FORESTRY ACT. SEVENTY EIGHT. IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL SINCE THEN. IT FOCUSES ON INCREASING TREE CANOPY. AND MANAGING EXISTING CANOPIES IN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE'S. WE ALSO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH. ARE. ARTICLE WITH STAFF THAT INCLUDES REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS AND CERTIFIED ARBORIST. AND. IN ADDITION TO. CLEANING THE AIR AND STORING CARBON THIS PROGRAM HAS REALLY SHOWN ITSELF TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ALMOST WITHOUT FAIL ALSO HAVE THE LOWEST TREE CANOPY COVER. AND THIS CAN THE CLEARLY SHOWN ON MAPS SHOWING A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. TREE CANOPY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE WHICH IMPACTS THE MOST VULNERABLE. NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE STATE. WITH PARKING LOTS STREETS AND PARKS THAT ARE SHADED BY TREES PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO. WALK INSTEAD OF DRIVE AND SPEND TIME OUTDOORS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS. IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS. THERE ARE SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF. URBAN TREES SUCH AS SIR ENERGY CONSERVATION. THEY IMPROVE AIR QUALITY. THEY INCREASED COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS. THE INCREASE. PUBLIC HELPED AND THEY GENERALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. SO THE BOTTOM LINE TAKE HOME MESSAGE IS THAT TREES IN URBAN COMMUNITIES. THIS STORE CARBON DAY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THEY MAKE A REAL TANGIBLE POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND THIS POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IS MOST PRONOUNCED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO OUR PROGRAM PROVIDES TECHNICAL FINANCIAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. NONPROFITS COMMUNITY GROUPS. PRIVATE BUSINESSES AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. AND THE TYPES OF GRANTS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN OUT TYPICALLY INCLUDE URBAN TREE PLANTING AND MAINTENANCE URBAN TREE IN THE TORIES. URBAN WOOD UTILIZATION AND FORCED MANAGEMENT PLANS. IN TOTAL CAL FIRES A COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM THAT'S ON THE GROUNDS TOTALING. THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO DATE IN CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INVESTMENT FUNDS. AND THE THERE'S CLEARLY STILL A NEED. A RECENT DATA INDICATE THAT CALIFORNIA'S URBAN AREAS HAVE ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE LAND AREA COVERED IN THREE COUNT UP THE ON THE AVERAGE. AND THIS IS. ACTUALLY AMONG THE LOWEST OF OF ALL STATES IN THE NATION. SO CLEARLY THERE ARE AND NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES TO PLANT MILLIONS MORE URBAN PIECING CALIFORNIA'S URBAN AREAS. AND THE URBAN FORESTS ARE. THERE ARE PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF URBAN AREAS DID PROVIDE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SAYS WALLACE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CALL BENEFITS. SO AS OPPOSED TO OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENTS ALL OF WHICH DEPRECIATING VALUES. TREES ACTUALLY APPRECIATE IN VALUE US TO GET LARGER AND OLDER THEY BECOME MORE VALUABLE. SO A AND DEMANDING TIME I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW NOTABLE PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT WE FELT WERE SUCCESSFUL. THEY'RE LOCATED IN RICHMOND SANDIEGO OR SAID THAT AND EL CENTRO. THE CITY OF RICHMOND A PLANTED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TREES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BY THE CITY AND ITS NONPROFIT PARTNERS AND THEIR NEWLY TRAINED LOCAL RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS. COLLABORATION WITH THE FOR NONPROFITS INSURED COVERING A WIDE RANGE OF DISADVANTAGED NEIGHBORHOODS. THE TREES WILL BE ACTIVELY MAINTAINED BY THE CITY IN THE LONG TERM AND THEY WILL HELP LOCAL AIR QUALITY. AND SAN DIEGO AND CHULA VISTA. THERE WAS A RELATIVELY NEW NON PROFITS WHICH IS PART TUNING WITH THE URBAN CORE OF SAN DIEGO AND OTHERS TO PLANT AND MAINTAIN TWELVE HUNDRED TREATS. THROUGHOUT THE MOST DISADVANTAGED. THAT'S OF TRACKS IN THE TWO CITIES. THEY'RE ALSO MODIFYING INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN NECESSARY TO CREATE HIGH QUALITY THREE PLANTING SITES WHICH ARE SOMETIMES LACKING IN THIS AREA. IN ADDITION TREE SAN DIEGO IS CREATING AT THREE STEWARDS PROGRAM. FAN LOCAL RESIDENTS IN HOW TO CONTINUE CARING FOR THE TREES AFTER GRANT. THE CITY OF EL CENTRO. IT'S REALLY A SUCCESSFUL COOPERATIVE PROJECT BETWEEN AL CENTRAL HALT BILL CALEXICO IMPERIAL AND BRAWLING. IT CREATES SHADY PLACES FOR RESIDENTS TO WRECK CREATE AND GATHER. OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT IN THESE DESERT CITIES. THE PROJECT THIS PLANTING AND MAINTAINING FOURTEEN HUNDRED DESERT CLIMATE APPROPRIATE TREES THROUGH THE FIVE CITY AREA. AND WILL BE LOCATED ALMOST ENTIRELY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE GRANT US RESULTED IN EXCELLENT COOPERATION. AND AMONG THE CITY'S INVOLVED. AND FINALLY THE CITY A MERCED. PLANTING. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TREES THAT SORT OF SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY. AS WELL AS DEVELOPING A URBAN FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN. AND THE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PLAN WILL ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TRUE URBAN FORCED EXPANSION IN THE FUTURE. SO. ENCLOSING WE FEEL THAT. THE URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM AND CAL FIRE CONTINUES TO BE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION TO ALSO MAKING. TANGIBLE POSITIVE DIFFERENCES IN PEOPLE LIVES PEOPLE'S LIVES NOTABLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO REDUCE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF CO TWO EQUIVALENTS. AND. WITHOUT I'LL HAND OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO LEE AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE TODAY MY NAME'S JULIE ALVIS AND DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. AND. WE ADMINISTER THE URBAN GREENING PROGRAM ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INVESTMENT PROGRAMS. CITY BEGAN I THOUGHT I WOULD EXPLAIN WHAT THE PROGRAM CONSIDERS TO BE AN URBAN GREENING PROJECT. URBAN GREENING PROJECTS CONVERT EXISTING URBAN HARD SCAPES AND TWO GREEN SPACES THAT USE. I NATURAL AND GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE APPROACHES TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE AND MORE VIBRANT COMMUNITIES. AND THE COMPETITIVE PROJECTS MAXIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THROUGH THEIR PROJECT DESIGN. AND SOME EXAMPLES OF ELIGIBLE URBAN GREENING PROJECTS INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT ENHANCEMENT EXPANSION OF NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS AND COMMUNITY SPACES. THE GREENING OF PUBLIC LANDS INSTRUCTION AT THE END AS STRUCTURES INCLUDING SCHOOLYARDS. GREEN STREET AN ALLEYWAY PROJECTS. AND THE CREATION OF NON MOTORIZED URBAN TRAILS THAT PROVIDE SAFE ROUTES BETWEEN AND RESIDENCES WORKPLACES COMMERCIAL CENTERS AND SCHOOLS. AND THEN ALSO PROJECTS THAT I'M HELP WITH OUR URBAN HEAT ISLAND MITIGATION AND ENERGY CONSERVATION. ALL COMPETITIVE PROJECTS MUST INCLUDE A COMPONENT THAT REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THIS IS ACHIEVED BY RECRUITING IN YOUR PROJECT DESIGNED THE PLANTING OF TREES TO SEQUESTER CARBON. OR THE STRATEGIC PLANTING OF TREES ARM NEXT TO BUILDINGS REDUCE OUR ENERGY USE IN THOSE BUILDINGS. AND OR BY CONSTRUCTING WALKING A BICYCLE PASSED REDUCE VEHICLE TRIPS AND MANY OF OUR PROJECTS I. ADDED CONTAINED A NUMBER OF THOSE APPROACHES. ALL COMPETITIVE PROJECTS ALSO PROVIDE MULTIPLE BENEFIT SO THAT IN ADDITION TO GHG REDUCTIONS. THEY ARE ALSO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAPTURING WATER COOLING ENVIRONMENTS REDUCING ENERGY AND PROVIDING PARK IN OPEN SPACE FOR HABITAT AND RECREATION. BEYOND GHG REDUCTIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF THE PROJECTS. THE PROJECTS THAT ARE MOST COMPETITIVE ALSO PROVIDE ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND HEALTH BENEFITS FOR COMMUNITIES. THESE BENEFITS CAN INCLUDE WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING CONTRACTING AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. INCREASED ACCESS TO NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS. I'M INCREASED ACCESS TO LOCALLY GROWN FOOD SOURCES PHYSICAL. ACTIVITY OPPORTUNITIES AND THIS IS JUST TO NAME A FEW. IN ADDITION STRONG COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND SUPPORT IS VITAL TO THE COMPETITIVE APPLICATIONS IN OUR PROGRAM. IN ROUND ONE. OF OUR PROGRAM IN NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WE RECENTLY AWARDED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN. FISCAL YEAR AT TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FUNDING TO THIRTY NINE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS NOW OF ENTERING INTO GRANT AGREEMENTS AND ANTICIPATE THAT MOST OF THESE CAPITAL PROJECTS. WILL BE FULLY COMPLETED AND TWENTY TWENTY. THE PROGRAM RECEIVED A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY THREE APPLICATIONS REQUESTING THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING. AFTER A MULTI DISCIPLINARY. TECHNICAL REVIEW PANEL SCORED APPLICATIONS WE ARE STAFF VISITED. FIFTY PROJECTS. AND WHICH IS PART OF THE PROCESS OF OUR GRANT AWARD CYCLE. AND FOLLOWING THE SITE VISITS THIRTY NINE PROJECTS WERE RECOMMENDED FOR FUNDING. NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THE FUNDS WERE AWARDED TO PROJECTS LOCATED IN AND BENEFITTING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HER S. B. FIVE THIRTY FIVE. AND USING CALLIN VIRUS GRAIN. THE REQUIRED TARGET FOR PROGRAM WAS SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. SOME STATISTICS FROM THIS FIRST ROUNDS. INCLUDE. SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT TREES TO BE PLANTED. TWENTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX METRIC TONS OF CO TWO ACQUITTALS LEE REDUCED. FIVE ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE ACRE FEET OF STORM WATERCAPTURE. THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT NINETY ONE ACRES OF ODD GREEN SPACE OPEN SPACE CREATED. AND FORTY TWO MILES OF COMMUTER TRAIL TO BE ADDED. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE LIKELY OTHER COMPONENTS TO THESE PROJECTS THAT FURTHER REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. BUT ARE NOT QUANTIFIED AT THIS TIME SUCH AS CARBON SEQUESTRATION FROM OTHER VEGETATION WATER ENERGY SAVINGS REDUCED ENERGY USE FROM CREATING COOLER ENVIRONMENTS. AND THEN. CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL CHANGE IN HOW PEOPLE ARE MOVING THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITIES BY ADDING IN LINKING TO AYE OTHER WHITE WALKING AND BIKING OPPORTUNITIES. SO THE ADDITIONAL JEAN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BEYOND WHAT IS ONLY MEASURED WITHIN THE PROJECT AREA. SOME SAMPLE PROJECTS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FROM THE FIRST ROUND ALSO ANOTHER PROJECT IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND. IT'S CALLED GREEN IN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. THIS PROJECTS IS ADDING ONE MILE OF BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN PATH PATHS AND PLANTING TREES INSTALLING STORM WATER PLANTERS. BIAS WHALES PULLED OUT SOME TRAFFIC CALMING FEATURES. IT BUILDS UPON ELEVEN YEARS OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CONNECTS TO EXISTING PARKS. WITH STRONG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND ITS PARTNERS. ANOTHER PROJECT THAT RECEIVE FUNDING FROM. WOULD IN LOS ANGELES THE LOS ANGELES NEIGHBORHOODS LAND TRUST. I'VE FOR THE WISHING TREE PARK THIS WILL ACTIVATE NEW COMMUNITY SPACE BY DEVELOPING A FORMER BROWNFIELD SITE AND TO EIGHT POINT FIVE. ACRES OF FATTY PARK. AND THE FORMER BROWNFIELD SITE WAS PREVIOUSLY OWNED BY CHEVRON FULLY REMAIN REMEDIATED. ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD TRIP AND PROJECT. AND THEN FINALLY AND YOU ALLUDED TO EARLIER WE'RE HAPPY TO AWARD TO THE CITY OF NORTH SHORE FOR THE NORTH SHORE COMMUNITY PARK. SAYS A PROJECT TO CREATE NEW MULTI USE PARK INCLUDING TREES DROUGHT TOLERANT PLANTS. PATTERSON PARK AMENITIES ON THIS IS A SHOVEL READY PROJECTS STRONG COMMUNITY SUPPORT STRONG MATCH. ANOTHER VERY GOOD PROJECTS. AND WE HAVE JUST BEGUN OUR SECOND ROUND OF THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM HAS TWENTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE TO AWARD. OUR SOLICITATION OPENED IN LATE JANUARY AND OUR FIRST WORKSHOP WAS HELD YESTERDAY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. OUR STAFF WILL BE HOLDING EIGHT WORKSHOPS IN TOTAL THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL NEXT BE IN LYNNWOOD THAN INDIA ó OAKLAND. FAST SALIA READING SAN DIEGO AND ONTARIO. OUR APPLICATIONS AND THE APPLICATIONS ARE DUE IN MID APRIL AND AWARDS ARE EXPECTED AND FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO JUST LIKE TO CLOSE. BY SAYING THAT. WHAT'S REALLY SATISFYING ABOUT ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM. WE DO GO OUT OF COURSE TO VISIT THE SITES YOU KNOW PRIOR TO CHOOSING PROJECTS TO AWARD AND TO SEE. THE VISION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT'S THERE YOU SEE THE SITE. AND THE POTENTIAL THAT IT HAS AND THEN TO COME BACK YEARS LATER TO SEE IT MATERIALIZE AND A REAL ASSET TO THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT YOU KNOW I WAS GONNA ASK QUESTION HOW MANY APPLICATIONS. SUBMITTED AND YOU YOU HIGHLIGHTED THAT HUNDRED FORTY THREE. AND OVERSUBSCRIBED SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR THE MONEY THAT WAS AVAILABLE BUT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SENATOR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NO. I WILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I'LL GO AHEAD AND CALL OF DIEM NEXT. A GROUP OF PANELISTS. FOR US WE HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND CINDY BLAME. I LEAN OVER LAW SCHOOL DEBORAH WEINSTEIN BLOOM AND. MR IGOR. LUCK ON. ME THIS MATTER EVERYONE GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME. FAME KILL AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I THINK WE ARE ALL FROM A STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ABOUT THIS PROGRAM THE IMPACTS ON THE VALUE. I'M MARY CHRISTMANN I'M WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC. WE ARE A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT'S WORKING TO CREATE HEALTHY CLIMATE SMART COMMUNITIES WITH ACCESS TO MAJOR FOR ALL AND WE'VE BEEN DOING IMPLEMENTATION URBAN DRAINING PROJECTS FOR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS THAT ACTUALLY. ARE FOUNDATION OUR HISTORY WHAT OUR WORK IS REALLY BUILT ON I'M AND WE'RE THRILLED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM I'M AND REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VALUE IN THE NEED FOR THE WORK. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE PART THE REASON THIS PROGRAM IS SO VALUABLE IS USE OUR CURRENT URBAN DESIGN IS HURTING US IT'S HURTING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS? WE HAVE GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT INCREASES CLIMATE IMPACTS INCREASES HEAT INCREASES POLLUTION AND AARON WATER ON IT IS ACTUALLY HURTING US AND HAS FETAL IMPACTS. THAT'S AREALITY THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS CATALYZING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES TO RE ENVISION THE ROLE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. RE ENVISION THE ROLE OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE AYE TO PROVIDE HEALTHY CONNECTED AND CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES THIS IS UNIQUE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DO THIS. IN ADDITION I WOULD REALLY SAY THAT THIS PROGRAM MARY'S AND MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION IN A SPECIAL WAY BUT THROUGH THE INVESTMENTS NOT ONLY DO WE GET LOW CARBON COMMUNITIES BUT WE ALSO GET ADAPTED COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE ABLE TO WEATHER SUITS STREAM WEATHER EVENTS ON AN IMPORTANT WAY I'M AND WERE ALREADY SEEING THOSE. WE ARE NOT READY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE WITH THAT I THINK I CONSTITUENTS IN YOUR DISTRICTS WOULD REALLY FEEL THE IMPACTS AND ARTICULATE FEELING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND A SEVERE WAY RIGHT NOW. WE ARE READY AND WE DON'T HAVE POTS OF MONEY THAT ARE INTEGRATING AYE CHANGING IN TRANSFORMING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HEALTHY CONNECTED COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS ONE THAT IS JUST GOTTEN STARTED WITH ONE FIRST ROUND. OF INVESTMENTS AND I THINK THE POTENTIAL IS SIGNIFICANT I WANT TO JUST SAY COUPLE STATS IN TERMS OF JUST THE PURE GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM. I'M FIRST A STUDY BY BERKELEY CITED THAT IF WE WERE TO DO A COOL COMMUNITY STRATEGY USING GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS I'M ACROSS THE STATE THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY AT MINIMUM. TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY FOUR MILLION TIMES ANNUALLY WE ALSO HAVE A STUDY LOOKING AT THE BAY AREA THAT IF WE WERE TO SHIFT TRANSPORTATION MODES TO ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL SHORT OR MEDIUM INCOME TRIPS. ARMS OF ONE TO FIVE MILES AYE INTO ACTIVE TRANSORTATION WOULD REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY FOURTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. AND REDUCE DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR OF VASCULAR DISEASE BY FOURTEEN PERCENT. WE ALSO HAVE AN ANALYSIS FROM THE CITY OF LA WHERE THEY'VE LOOKED AT. LARGE SCALE TRANSFORMATION OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO THEN LOCALLY SOURCED THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY PERCENT OF THEIR WATER. THESE ARE REAL IMPACT ON THESE ARE MULTIPLE BENEFIT IN THIS DOESN'T EVEN SPEAK TO THE REALITY OF CLEAN AIR CLEANER WATER. MORE RECREATION I'M HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW WE NEED IN TERMS OF AYE DAY INCREASED IMPACTS WERE SAYING FROM FLOOD TO WILDFIRE. AYE TO SEA LEVEL RISE AND I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH A COUPLE QUICK POINTS ONE. STATE PROGRAMS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE THAN JUST FIND IMPORTANT PRICE. FUNDING IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THE WAY WE STRATEGIZING CREE INNOVATIVE PROJECTS LIKE THIS. CATALYZES INNOVATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ISN'T JUST ABOUT FINDING THIS IS ABOUT SPURRING INTERNALIZING INNOVATION INTEGRATED AND ACROSS FUNCTIONAL I INVESTMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM HAD DONE. IT INTEGRATED PLANNING. I'M IN A NEW WAY FOR A LOT OF COMMUNITIES THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY PROGRAMS FROM CAP AND TRADE. THAT GOES TO WORK IN A REALLY VISIBLE WAY IN COMMUNITIES SO COMMUNITIES CAN SEE THE IMPACT OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO CREATE LOW CARBON COMMUNITIES FROM THE REVENUE OF CAP TRADE. THEY CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET INVISIBLY SEE CHANGES. ANOTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION WE ARE WORKING WITH STATES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WERE LOOKING AT CURRENT PRICING PROGRAMS. WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN THEY CREATE THEIR OWN CLAIM A PROBLEM POP UP POLICIES WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BIG BY SIGNIFICANT REVENUES GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA. IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR INVESTMENT STRATEGY SHOULD BE AS ARE LOOKING AT CLIMATE POLICIES ON THIS HAVE TO BE PART OF THE BLUEPRINTS. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE STATE OF WASHINGTON WHO'S REALLY LOOKING AT EVERY PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S POLICY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD DO IT. AND IF WE DO NOT INCLUDE CRITICAL STRATEGIES LIKE GREEN MULTIPLE BENEFIT GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND URBAN GREENING THAT MEANS THAT ACROSS THE WORLD WERE JURISDICTIONS ARE LOOKING AT US FOR A MODEL. THAT THEY'RE MISSING THAT CRITICAL ESSENTIAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IN CREATING LOW CARB BANG HEALTHY RESILIENT COMMUNITIES ANSWERED THANK YOU FOR THE ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE I'M WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I'M MAKING SURE THIS WORK CONTINUES TO BE FUNDED. GOING WITHOUT. AND COVER UPS ARE GONNA COVER THREE ASPECTS OF THE. OF. URBAN FORESTRY. A FIRST A TO TALK ABOUT RELEASE ROLE IN URBAN FORESTRY AND THEN I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT ARE GRANTING PROGRAMS ON A COUPLE OF PROJECTS. UNLESS I'M GOING TO COVER SOME OF THE ISSUES THE KINDA CO BENEFITS PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY BUILDING AND JOBS. OF FOR THIRTY YEARS CALIFORNIA LEAST BERNIE UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION FOR. A URBAN FORCE NONPROFITS GRASSROOTS NONPROFIT. AND THE PLAN CARE FOR TREES IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS USING A MODEL BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT TRUE CHANGE OCCURS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE. LOCAL RESIDENTS INVOLVED IN MAKING DECISIONS AS YOU SAID EARLIER SMALL INVESTMENTS MAKING BIG CHANGES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FROM THE NETWORK IT RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT A HUNDRED STRONG AND INCLUDES GROUPS LIKE TREE SAN DIEGO URBAN RELIEF POINT THIS TREE PEOPLE A CLEANER GREENER EAST LA AND SEVERAL LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS. WE PROVIDE EDUCATION ADVOCACY AND BUT FOR THE NETWORK AND ANY INTERESTED COMMUNITY BENEFIT ORGANIZATION IT'S NOT JUST SOMEBODY WHO NORMALLY PLANTS TREES BUT ANY GROUP. OUR PRIMARY STATEWIDE PARTNERS IN THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE THE NATURE CONSERVANCY TRANSFORMING HOUSING CALIFORNIA. THESE PARTNERS WORK WITH US ON INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS FOR SOCIAL EQUITY AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO BRING TREES TO THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED MOST. AND THAT MOST OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART ABOUT TREES THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF THOSE TREES. SO FOR THIRTY YEARS WE'VE ALSO ADMINISTERED GRANTS. CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF THESE GRANTS ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDING BUT WE ALSO GET SOME FUNDING FROM OTHER SOURCES. TREES R. COST OF AND A COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS FOR CAPTURING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. AND FOR IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF RESIDENTS BECAUSE TREES ARE FILTERING. OUT PARTICULATE MATTER. NEAR HIGH TRAFFIC ROADWAYS WHICH. IS OVERLY BURDENED IN. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS HELPING PROTECT URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS FROM EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE BRINGS. WITH EXTREME HEAT AND AIR QUALITY BEING OF GREATEST CONCERN TO PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AT THIS POINT TIME. AND AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OVERLY AFFECTS DISADVANTAGED COMMITTEES BECAUSE YOU'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT UTILITY COSTS. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE TREES WE DON'T HAVE A DOUBLE TRANSPIRATION AND ALL THOSE COOLING. BENEFITS. SO TREES ARE CRITICAL COMPONENT OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION TOOL KIT FOR DESIGNING HEALTHY CITIES AND BUILDING COOPER KENNEDY RESILIENCY. SO WHEN THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDING BECAME AVAILABLE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. RELIEF FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY GROUPS. IN THE UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS AND MORE ESTABLISHED URBAN FOREST NONPROFITS THE BUDDY SYSTEM ESSENTIALLY TO SAY THAT WE NEEDED TO DEVELOP CAPACITY FOR URBAN FORCE PROJECT SENATOR RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THIS WAS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS WE BEGAN A PROGRAM OF DEEP OUT REACH INTO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO THAT THE FUND WILL GO TO THOSE. ORGANIZATIONS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT TO ONE OF THEM IS. A GREAT EXAMPLE THAT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN AN URBAN FORCED NONPROFIT URBAN RELIEF IN OAKLAND. AND COMMUNITY BENEFIT ORGANIZATION. EPISCOPAL IMPACT FUND WORKING IN ONE OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS. PROGRAM IS CALLED GREEN SANTIAGO AND OUR NEIGHBORS WHICH IS PLANTING NINETY TWO TREES AND A COMMUNITY GARDEN. THE FISCAL IMPACT FUND IS ALSO PART DURING WITH ENGLISH HE HAD THE SANTIAGO LOW INCOME SPANISH SPEAKING CONGREGATION THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FOOD BANK WHICH SERVES MOSTLY ASIAN. AMERICANS AND INDIGENOUS PERMACULTURE A GROUP WORKING ON FOOD SECURITY. THIS THIS. GETTING TOGETHER ADVERSE PARTNERSHIPS IN COMMUNITIES IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL IN BRINGING RESIDENTS TOGETHER. A FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND STRENGTHENING THE COMMUNITY OVER. UP PLANTING TREES IS AN EASY INTRODUCTION TO COMMUNITY ACTIVISM AND ENVIRONMENTALISM. AND HAS BEEN SHOWN IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THE COMMUNITY ACTIVISM LEADS TO CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS LONG TERM STEWARDSHIP OF THESE TREES. TO CONTINUE AS FAR AS GRANT SUPPORT. IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSCORE THE UNIQUE WAYS IN WHICH URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY REACH AND BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. RELIEF HAS BEEN ABLE TO MODEL AND SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALL GROUPS. THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT FROM CAP AND TRADE. FOR SMALL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO SUBMIT A GOVERNMENT GRANT APPLICATION FOR HER IDEA OF REASONS INCLUDING SIMPLY AWARENESS ABOUT THE PROGRAM. CAPACITY AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. BECAUSE WE DO PASSED THROUGH GRANTS OR WE TAKE WE GET FUNDING FROM. OTHER CAL FIRE AND WE DO GRANTS TO THE SMALL ORGANIZATIONS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. ONLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE APPLICATIONS WE RECEIVED FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WERE ELIGIBLE TO BE REVIEWED. THAT MEANT THEY HAD EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED SIMPLY TO BE REVIEWED SO. BECAUSE OUR MISSION IS TO EMPOWER GRASSROOTS EFFORTS THAT LED TO OUR POLICY OF SUPPORTING GRANTEES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR APPLICATIONS WERE ELIGIBLE. WITHOUT YET TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SUBSTANCE AND MERIT OF THE APPLICATION. WE ARE LITERALLY TEACHING GRANT. OPERATION SKILLS AND BUILDING CAPACITY. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL GO FAR. WE WERE TO ALL APPLICANTS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING VARIOUS UNFAMILIAR COMPONENTS LIKE FISCAL SPONSORSHIP. A QUANTIFICATION OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION VALUES FOR PROJECTS AND OBTAINING PERMISSION TO PROP UP PLANT FORMS FROM CITIES LEARNING THE SYSTEM. IS WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT IN SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE LEARN SOME THESE COMMUNITIES. AS A RESULT WE WERE ABLE TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE APPLICATIONS FROM FORTY PERCENT TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. AND OF COURSE AFTER GRANT AWARD WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT GRANTEES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROJECT TO COMPLETION. A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF NEW COMMUNITY GROUPS ARE WORKING WITH OUR FATHERS AND FAMILY. OF SAN JOAQUIN IN STOCKTON AS WELL AS PARA PIONEERS IN SAN FERNANDO. LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A ANOTHER PROJECT HAPPENING AMIGO STILL LOS RIOS NO THIS IS A MORE ESTABLISHED URBAN FORCE GROUP. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO HAS AN INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS VISION OF THE EMERALD NECKLACE. LINKING MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACRES OF PARKS AND OPEN SPACES ALONG THREE DIFFERENT RIVERS AND LA. AND EGOS IS DOING IT METHODICALLY SEGMENT BY SEGMENT. THE FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM CALIFORNIA RELIEF OF SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PLANT. TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TREES. IS FOR THE WHITTIER NARROWS PROJECT RUNNING ALONG TO THE RIVERS AND TO MASSIVE FREEWAYS WERE OTHERS OF SOME OF AMERICA'S WORST AIR POLLUTION. AND THAT SOME OF THE MOST POPULATED URBAN AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES. HAVING LOST TREES TO DRUM AND BASS PASSED THE RESTORING THESE TREES BY PARTING WITH HIGH SCHOOL SERVICE CLUBS GIRL SCOUTS SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CONSERVATION CORPS. ONE OF THE CONSERVATION CORPS. YOUNG MEN ASSIGNED TO IT RICARDO BART TO THE SECOND. TOOK THE BUS AT SIX THIRTY AM FROM HIS HOMEOWNERS WHO TO CUMPLIR TREES HERE HE DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BUT LATER GRADUATED WHILE WORKING ON ANOTHER JOB CORPS PROGRAM. BUT RICARDO EXPLAINED IT DIDN'T REALLY LIKE SCHOOL WOULD RATHER DO SOMETHING MORE PHYSICAL. WORKING WITH PLANTS TREES IN NATURE HELPED RICARDO TO FIND A SENSE OF BELONGING HE HADN'T FELT BEFORE HE SAID. AND PLANTING ENTRIES IN BEING IN NATURE EVEN URBAN NATURE HELPED HIM DEAL WITH FRUSTRATION AND ANGER. HIS NEW ATTITUDE WAS REFLECTED IN HIS APPROACH TO DIGGING IN DIRT THAT'S ROCK HARD DUE TO DROUGHT IN. OUR CLIMATE ARE EVERY CLIMATE HE SAID IT WAS HARD AT FIRST BUT THEN YOU LEARN HOW TO DO IT. THEN YOU START TO ENJOY IT WHICH IS A GREAT LIFE SKILL ANYWHERE. THEM THIS LEADS US TO OUR LAST. TOPIC WHICH IS JOBS. AND. WE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE TREES ARE WONDERFUL WHICH AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THESE PROJECTS IN COMMUNITIES. AND THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WANT THE TREES BUT THEY WANT JOBS. AND SEVERAL OF THE EXISTING URBAN FORCE PROJECTS ARE PROVIDING WAGES PER EXAMPLE THE URBAN CORE SAN DIEGO IS DOING THAT IN PARTNERSHIP THE TO SAN DIEGO SUSTAINABLE CLAREMONT HAS THE GREEN CREW PROGRAM. AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT EARTH TEAM AND MADERA COALITION FOR COMMUNITY JUSTICE. THOSE OUR NONPROFIT JOBS BASED ON GRANTS. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT HAVE STEADY JOBS AND SO IT WAS IT WAS LIKE A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN WHEN WE HEARD THAT THE TREE CARE INDUSTRY ISN'T HAVING A DIRE SHORTAGE OF. OF TRIGGER WORKERS AND THEY WERE WILLING TO EXPOSE EXPAND THE LOTOF. TIME AND EFFORT TO PROP PROVIDE TRAINING FOR THIS. SO WE ARE SUPPORTING A PROJECT WITH LOCAL TREE CARE COMPANIES MERRITT COLLEGE IN OAKLAND AS WELL AS THE TREE CARE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION TO DEVELOPMENT URBAN ARBORIST CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS AN ASSOCIATE OF SCIENCE CURRICULUM. THAT PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO STABLE GOOD PAYING JOBS. AND THESE ARE THESE ARE JOBS THAT WERE STABLE EVEN WHEN WE HAVE THE RECESSION. AND THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THE BAY AREA. ANYWHERE FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS SO IT'S IT SHOULD NOT THE MINIMUM WAGE AND TING THE STARTING SALARY. MUCH BETTER THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE AT THIS POINT. FROM THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CURRICULUM SECTOR PARTNERSHIP MODEL WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE TO ALL INTERESTED CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WE CAN TAKE THIS MODEL IN USE AT ANOTHER SPOT PURCHASED. THE CITY WAS REALLY PART ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU HAD THE TREE CARE COMPANIES INVOLVED AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA HIRE AND THEY WANTED TO BE THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM WAS SET UP RIGHT SO THAT. PEOPLE READY TO BE HIRED PRODUCT ABOUT. SO WE ALL KNOW THAT PLANTING TREES IS GREAT AND OUR BEGINNING TO PLANT JOBS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS AS WELL AS YOUR LEADERSHIP IN CAP AND TRADE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN GARCIA COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LINA VELASCO AND THE PLANNING MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF RICHMOND LOCATED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THE COLD. BENEFITS OF URBAN GREENING AND GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS HAVE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE RICHMOND. RICHMOND IS A COMMUNITY OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OUR POPULATIONS MAJORITY PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THE CITY INCLUDE SEVERAL CENSUS TRACTS THAT ARE WITHIN THE TOP. TEN AND TWENTY PERCENT. OF POLLUTION BURDEN COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE ACCORDING TO CALLIN VIRUS SCREEN THREE POINT NOW. RICHMOND AS HAVE MANY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ADOPTED A CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF. OF UPDATING ITS GENERAL SAFETY LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN TO CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITY. CAN IDENTIFY MITIGATION AND MEASURES THAT THE CITY CAN TAKE TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENT. THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN IDENTIFIES FEASIBLE CITY AND COMMUNITY ACTIONS THAT CAN COST EFFECTIVELY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH ACROSS SECTORS. ONE OF THE KEY ACTIONS IDENTIFIED IN OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES IS TO EXPAND URBAN GREENING AND GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. WHY GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND URBAN GREENING? THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS BOTH IMPORTANT FOR SEQUESTERING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND FOR MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE USES VEGETATION SOILS AND NATURAL PROCESSES TO MANAGE WATER. AND IMPROVE THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THE CITY WILL REDUCE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY ME TENUOUSLY PREPARING FOR IMPACTS SUCH AS SEA LEVEL RISE AND FLOODING. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE BENNETT'S BENEFITS FLOOD CONTROL WATER SUPPLY OF POLLUTION REDUCTION. RECREATIONAL OPEN SPACE URBAN AGRICULTURE AND URBAN WILDLIFE HABITAT. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE URBAN FORESTRY ALL WORK IN CONCERT WITH THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO MAKE LOCAL LANDSCAPES. MORE PRODUCTIVE AND PROVIDE BENEFITS TO LOCAL RESIDENTS AND ECOSYSTEMS. IN THE FIRST ROUND OF URBAN GREENING FINDINGS AWARDED IN NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO PROJECTS OF RICHMOND RECEIVE FUNDING. THE RICHMOND WHILE THIS TRAIL PHASE ONE. AND GREEN THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. GRITTING THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD WILL LEVERAGE A SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM GRANT. BY PLANTING APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED TREES. AND INSTALLING APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY STORM WATER PLANTERS BIAS WHEELS FILLED WITH NATIVE PLANTS. TO TRANSFORM A NEW BIKE BOULEVARD. INTO ONE OF THIS IN ONE OF THE STATE'S MOST DISADVANTAGED NEIGHBORHOODS. THESE ONCE BARREN ENTRY LIST STREETS WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO A LUSH GREEN VIBRANT AND HEALTHY PUBLIC SPACES. THE RICHMOND WHILE THIS TRIAL PHASE ONE IS A ONE POINT ONE MILE ADA ACCESSIBLE MULTIMODAL MULTI BENEFIT GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE CORRIDOR. LOCATED IN A PARK POOR. UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOOD ENRICHMENT IT WILL ENHANCE ACCESS TO URBAN GREEN SPACES BY CREATING A NEW. SAFE BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN PATHWAY THAT WILL CONNECT DOWNTOWN RICHMOND. TO THE RICHMOND GREENWAY UNITY PARK MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR PARK AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY TRAIL. THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF THE IRON TRIANGLE IN CORONADO WILL BE ABLE TO SAFELY WALK OR RIDE THEIR BICYCLES TO THESE NEARBY URBAN GREEN SPACES. WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING HIT BY A CAR. THESE PROJECTS ONE BELT ONCE BELTS WILL RESULT IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN SEVERAL OTHER CO HEALTH BENEFITS FOR RICHMOND RESIDENTS. THESE INCLUDE IMPROVED AIR QUALITY IMPROVED WATER QUALITY IMPROVED ACCESS TO OPEN SPACE. AND WILL ENCOURAGE WALKING AND BIKING REDUCING RISK OF OBESITY RELATED ILLNESSES. RICHMOND HAS THE PIT CLIMATE CHANGE HAS HIGH POTENTIAL IMPACTS IN RICHMOND INCLUDING WILDFIRE RESTFUL ADDRESS. URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT. AND. AS YOU KNOW MANY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SO THESE PROJECTS WILL HELP IMPROVE RESILIENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE CITY IS URGING THE COMMITTEE ON THE GOVERNOR TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING TO THE URBAN GREETING CRAP PROGRAM. SO THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPALITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE CAN IMPLEMENT PROJECTS LIKE THE RICHMOND WELLNESS TRAIL. AND THE GREEN THE ELAPID CROWED THIS PROGRAM AS ONE A FEW PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT SUPPORTS THE TOTAL CONVERSION OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. INTO GREEN SPACE THAT IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF OUR RESIDENTS THIS PROGRAM FUNDS BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN IMPROVEMENTS. AS WELL AS URBAN GREENING AND GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. THE STATE HAS SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT WILL ONLY FIND ONE COMPONENT OF THESE FOR EXAMPLE THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WILL ONLY FUND THE PEDESTRIAN THE BIKE IMPROVEMENTS. AND NOT FUN ANY TREE PLANTING OR VEGETATION. AND ONE OF THIS SINGLE MOST. COMMENTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR RESIDENTS IS THAT YOU CAN'T JUST BUILD THE BY CLEAN IT'S HOUSE TO BE THE TOTAL CONVERSION BECAUSE IT THE ST STILL DOESN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE. SO THIS ALLOWS THE CITY TO IMPLEMENT A COMPLETE PROJECT WITHOUT ASSEMBLING FUNDING FROM VARIOUS SOURCES WHICH OFTEN DELAYS THE DELIVERY OF PROJECTS TO OUR RESIDENTS. AND CAN ALSO BE ADMINISTRATIVELY BERNARD SOME TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE ALREADY IMPACTED BY INSUFFICIENT STAFFING. FOR URBAN GRITTY PROGRAM CONNECTS LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO LARGER STATEWIDE CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES BY TRANSFORMING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH. URBAN GREENY AND GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS RESULTS IN TANGIBLE IMPROVEMENTS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE A FORUM FOR RESIDENTS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUPPORTING CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION MEASURES IN THEIR COMMUNITY. URBAN GREENING AND INFRASTRUCTURE ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF CLIENTS MIGHT CITIES AND THEREBY SHOULD RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE STATE'S CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. RICHMOND IS A COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T JUST LIKE TO PLAN WE LIKE TO IMPLEMENT AND WOOD LACK WITHOUT FINDING WERE UNABLE TO DO THAT GIVEN ARE CONSTRAINED RESOURCES. AND SO WE ASK THE COMMITTEE TO TO. HELP US CONTINUE FUNDING FOR THESE IMPORTANT PROGRAMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THINK YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT THAT I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF. KNOWING SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE CITY OF RICH MEN AT GOING BACK TO. SOME OF THE WORK BEING DONE WITH CALIFORNIA I'M IN THE HEALTH ELEMENT INCORPORATED TO THE GENERAL PLAN. AND MORE RECENTLY IN OUR. QUEST TO GET THIS LEGISLATION US LIKE PARK BOND ON THE BALLOT WE HAD OUR ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION OUT A PUBLIC PARK. AND GOT TO. HERE AND LEARN ABOUT THE PROJECT THAT YOU JUST HIGHLIGHTED SO THANK YOU FOR UP. CAN READ REAFFIRMING HOME PORTENT VALUABLE IT IS THAT WE GET OUT. OF THE CAPITAL AND DOES YOU TRAVEL UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON AS IT RELATES TO THE INVESTMENT SAID THAT WE'RE MAKING. AND THEY WERE ASKING TO BE MADE IN THE LONG TERM SO THANK YOU. OUR NEXT SPEAKER. I GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DEBORAH ONE SCENE BLOOM I'M THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND RESEARCH AT TREAT PEOPLE. IN CASE YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WHICH HE PEOPLE WE ARE AN ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFIT LOCATE IN LOS ANGELES. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON URBAN FORESTRY AND WATER POLICY ISSUES FOR OVER FOUR DECADES NO. THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE. SO TO THE POINT AT HAND JUST BY THE ACTUAL PRESENCE OF THIS COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU'RE CLEAR THAT WE'RE FACING EXTREME INTENSE CLIMATE IMPACTS SOONER THAN WE EXPECTED. AND WE DON'T HOW TIME TO WASTE. BUT THERE'S GOOD NEWS TO GET THESE ANSWERS WE DO NOT HAVE TO RECREATE THE WHEEL. TREE PEOPLE HAS SPENT YEARS STUDYING HOW AUSTRALIA HAS GONE THROUGH SEVERAL OF ITS EMERGENCIES SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. FOR INSTANCE HOW THEY SURVIVE THEIR DEVASTATING TWELVE YEAR MILLENNIUM DROUGHT AND HOW THEY'RE GETTING THROUGH THEIR CURRENT INCREASED HEAT PERIODS. WE FOCUS ON AUSTRALIA BECAUSE OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE QUITE SIMILAR IN ADDITION TO YOU OBVIOUSLY OUR LIFESTYLE AND OUR LANGUAGE. THE CITY IN MELBOURNE FOR EXAMPLE HAS ABOUT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE THE SAME AMOUNT AS THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN IS FACING THE SAME CLIMATE CHALLENGES AS WE ARE. DROUGHT THE FLIPSIDE OF DROUGHT FLOODING AND INTENSE HEAT IN ADDITION THE CITY OF ADELAIDE HAS THE SCHEMES. MEDITERRANEAN TYPE OF CLIMATE THAT MUCH OF CALIFORNIA HOUSE. WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD ADOPT AND THEN ADAPT LESSONS FROM AUSTRALIA TO OUR CURRENT SITUATION. REGARDING URBAN FORESTRY IN PARTICULAR. WELL AUSTRALIA PROACTIVELY DEPLOYED EMERGENCY TACTICS DURING THEIR DROUGHT TO SEE THEIR LARGE HERITAGE TREES VAST AREAS OF LAND ENTRIES DIED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE. IN THIS IS BECAUSE DURING THE DROUGHT THE ROLLING MONTHS LEFT AT ONE POINT OF WATER IN WHAT THEY CALLED THEIR CATCHMENT BUT WE COLOR WATERSHED. SO NO IRRIGATION WAS ALLOWED. WHEN NEED SAT BACK AND FINALLY WERE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HAPPENED. THEY REALIZE THE HUGE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THIS HOT ON THE ON THE PEOPLE BOTH PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND PHYSICALLY. IN FACT BASED ON THAT WITHOUT THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE SHADE AND EVAPORATIVE COOLING OF LEAFY TREE CANOPIES THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND INTENSIFIED AND IN FACT BECAME LETHAL. FOR EXAMPLE IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINE MELVIN EXPERIENCED IF SIXTY TWO PERCENT INCREASE IN HEAT RELATED MORTALITY PROMPTING THE ENTIRE CITY TO RETHINK OUR THE WAY IT. AYE THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED ITS DOUBT RICK DROUGHT RESTRICTIONS. THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE NOW THEN IN JANUARY IS SEVENTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT NOT. DISSIMILAR TO MANY OF OUR CITIES HERE. DURING THIS EXTREME HEAT EVENT IT WAS. THE TEMPERATURES WERE EXCEEDING A HUNDRED AND NINE DEGREES FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS. PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO SAVE LIVES LIVES IN TIMES OF EXTREME HEAT. WAS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE LIVED IN A COMMUNITY WITH DENSE TREE CANOPY. I IF YOU LOOK AT THE HANDOUTS THAT I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO YOU BY KATIE. ONE OF THEM LOOKS LIKE THIS. I. THE CITY MELTING CAME UP WITH A STRATEGY OF FOUR PRONG STRATEGY FIRST TO DOUBLE THEIR TREE CANOPY COVER THIS WAS FROM THERE TWENTY PERCENT TO FORTY PERCENT. TO TO INCREASE PERMEABILITY THREE TO INCREASE GREENSPACE AND FOR WAS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF STORM WATER HARVESTING. ALL OF THIS WAS IN AN EFFORT. NOT FOR THE CITY TO REDUCE I. BEAT COOL THE CITY BY FOUR DEGREES CENTIGRADE OR ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. SO HOW OF THE CHANGE GIVEN THEIR EXPERIENCES ONE THEY BEGAN TO SIGNIFICANTLY INVEST IN KEEPING THEIR TREES HEALTH BEING MAINTAINED IN THIS EXAMPLE I JUST GAVE YOU THE CITY CITY ALONE OF MOUNTAIN. INVESTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS A INTO THE FOUR STRATEGIES I JUST MENTIONED. SECOND THE CREATING NEW SOURCES OF WATER STORMWATER CAPTURE IN SOME CASES THEY WENT AS FAR AS TAPPING INTO STORES TREATING THE WATER AND THEN USING THAT TO MAINTAIN THEIR TREES. AND THEY CHANGE THEIR LAWS POLICIES IN AND SENTENCED TO TAKE. TO HELP THE URBAN FOREST DRIVE AND TAKE AN AGGRESSIVE STANCE AGAINST THEIR NEW HARSH CLIMATE REALITY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK ACROSS THE OCEAN TO LEARN THESE LESSONS WE CAN LEARN BECOME LOOK IN OUR OWN BACKYARD. I TREAT PEOPLE WE ARE NOW LEADING A NATIONAL COLLABORATIVE ON URBAN COOLING WITH YALE UCLA AND SEVERAL OTHERS. AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE MODELING AT THE COUNTY OF LA THE OPTIMAL PRESCRIPTION THE COMBINATION OF VEGETATION INCLUDING TREES AND REFLECTIVE SURFACES. TO DECREASE HUMAN MORTALITY IN TIMES OF EXTREME HEAT. SOME GONNA GIVE YOU JUST A FEW INITIAL RESULTS. THE FIRST IS UNFORTUNATELY LA'S UNIQUE DISTINCTION BUT SAID WE HAVE A GREATER NUMBER OF WINTER DAYS ABOVE NINETY DEGREES THAN ANY OTHER REGION IN THE COUNTRY. THIS MEANS THAT WE OCCASIONALLY HAVE HEAT RELATED DEATHS EVEN IN THE WINTER. SECOND ME MORTALITY INCREASES FIVE TIMES FROM THE FIRST TO THE FIFTH. CONSECUTIVE DAY. AND THE AFTER THE FIFTH DAY MORTALITY RISK OF A IN LOS ANGELES INCREASES FORTY SIX PERCENT HISPANIC COMMUNITIES AND FORTY EIGHT PERCENT AN ELDERLY BLACK COMMUNITIES. WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS STUDIES ARE SHOWING THAT ANY INCREASE COMBINATION THAT THEIR MODELING OF INCREASED? TREES AND VEGETATION AND OUR REFLECTIVITY RESULTS IN AT LEAST DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE DECREASES AND HE WON MORTALITY SO THERE ARE ANSWERS OUT THERE. LAST YEAR LIKE TO SHIFT YOUR COUPLE LOCAL EXAMPLES OF WHAT A TREE PLANTINGS ARE DOING IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES BY LOCAL I MEAN LOS ANGELES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE BASED. FIRST AS PART OF OUR SCHOOL GREENING INITIATIVE SHE PEOPLE RECEIVED HELLFIRE FUNDING TO DO SOME GREAT WORK AT CHATSWORTH PARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. ONE OF OUR STAFFERS GUY WORK WITH THE GREEN TEAM OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS REMOVED CONCRETE PLANTED TWENTY FOUR TREES ON THE PLAYGROUND THEY CREATED A READING GROW FOR THE KIDS. THE KIDS ARE REALLY TAKING OWNERSHIP OF THESE TREES THEY WATER THEM. BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT IT'S NOW PROVIDING THE KIDS WITH A RESPITE FROM THE WIND AND THE HEAT IN THIS VERY HOT AND WINDY AREA. IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER HANDOUT I'VE PROVIDED HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IT. WHAT THIS SHOWS IS A TYPICAL STREET ON A VERY COOL DAY AT SEVENTY THREE DEGREES ON THIS DAY? ON BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT WITH A SPECIAL INFRARED CAMERA. IT SHOWS YOU THAT THE UNSHADED SIDEWALK IS A HUNDRED AND SEVEN DEGREES. THE SHEET INSIDE WHAT HOWEVER IS EIGHTY TWO DEGREES SO THAT TREED MADE A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DEGREE DIFFERENCE FOR THE PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE. THE LAST EXAMPLE IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH FUNDS TO PLAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED TREES AND PARKWAYS IN. A COMMERCIAL QUARTERS AND HUNTING TO PARKING CUT A HATE THROUGH MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. THESE PLANTINGS ARE GOING TO INCLUDE IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES THROUGH HEAT REDUCING SHADING CLEANER AIR. SO OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE URBAN TREE CANOPY BY FOURTEEN HUNDRED TREES IT'S GOING TO CREATE LOCAL JOBS. AND INSPIRE RESIDENTS TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR HOW WILL IT DO THIS. BECAUSE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND EDUCATION ARE EXTREMELY VITAL COMPONENTS TO THIS WORK. FOR EXAMPLE VOLUNTEERS IN THE COMMUNITY ARE RECRUITED DIRECTLY BY REGIONAL MANAGER AT HIGH SCHOOLS CHURCHES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. OUT RESIDENTS ON EACH STREET WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE PLANTINGS ARE PARTICIPATING. AND EVERY VOLUNTEER WORK DAY BEGINS WITH A TREE CARE AYE TRAINING. ALSO EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO OTHER HOMES NOT INVOLVED SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF TREES. WE CHOSE THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE HIGH POPULATION DENSITY OF EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND% RESIDENTS IN JUST OVER FOUR SQUARE MILES. IS COMMUNITIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE A LACK OF AIR CONDITIONING. LOW TREE CANOPY IN OTHER WAYS TO COMBAT THE EXTREME HEAT. MODELING SUGGEST THAT BOTH IN HUNTINGTON PARK CUT HAY COULD HAVE THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE D. NONE NUMBER OF DAYS WITH TEMPERATURES OVER NINETY FIVE DEGREES AND AS LITTLE AS. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND OF COURSE AIR QUALITY IS ALSO A CHALLENGE. AND THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF ONE COMMUNITY. THEIR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR IDENTIFIED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTY ALONE. HUGE PARTS OF OUR POPULATION ARE AT RISK SO IN CLOSING WE ASKED THE LEGISLATURE SHE CAN. SHOULD INVEST IN URBAN FORESTRY NOW DO AS MANY FUNDING VEHICLES AS POSSIBLE THIS SHOULD BE AMONGST OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHARTER CO SENATE RISE OF STAFF. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I'M EAGER ELECTION I'M YOUR UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ADVISER BASED OUT OF SAM ACCOUNTS AND CISCO COUNTIES. AND I HELP BERMAN CREE MANAGERS. DO THEIR JOB SUSTAINABLY. AS WELL AS OUR COMMUTE BENEFIT ORGANIZATIONS WITH THEIR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. SO OFTEN SOME A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST TRY TO WRAP UP BY KIND OF SUMMARIZING THE THREE KINDS OF BENEFITS WE DERIVE FROM URBAN TREES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF UNIQUE TO URBAN TREES SECOND THINK OF IT. CAN THINK OF A FIRST CATEGORY THE BENEFIT THAT TREES PROVIDE TO OTHER LIVING THINGS YOU KNOW BIRDS BEES ALL OF THAT STUFF THE ECOLOGICAL SIDE OF THINGS. THE SECOND KIND OF BENEFITS WOULD BE THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. AND THAT WAS MENTIONED QUITE A BIT ORANGE TODAY THOSE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO PAY FOR. SO IF A TREE SHADE YOUR HOUSE AND YOU DON'T OF THROWING RECOGNITION AS MUCH. THAT'S AN ECOSYSTEM SERVICE. AND UNIVERSITY RESEARCH OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAS REALLY QUANTIFY THAT SO. WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT IT WAS NICE TO HAVE A TREE SHEDDING THEIR HOUSE. BUT STARTING ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO WE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT A NUMBER ON IT. SO THAT AND IN FACT YOUR BACKGROUND DOCUMENT SUMMARIZES THAT VERY NICELY THE BENEFITS OF THOSE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. OUR SUMMER AROUND EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. NOW. THE THIRD KIND OF TRUE BENEFITS I THINK THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING PART AND I'M GLAD CINDY MENTIONED. MENTION THEM RD HEALTH BENEFITS. AND THIS IS REALLY RECENT UNIVERSITY RESEARCH GOING BACK ONLY ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS. THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY. EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND AGAIN IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK THIS IS SURPRISING TO ANYBODY TO SAY THAT. PEOPLE IN. NEIGHBORHOODS IN MORE TREES TEND TO BE HEALTHIER DESERVE JUST NICER PLACES TO LIVE. BUT REALLY QUANTIFYING THOSE EFFECTS OF BEEN DIFFICULT. GOING BACK TO ABOUT THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WE NOW HAVE NUMBERS THAT SHOW. REDUCTION IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE THAT SHOW REDUCTION IN. OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS AND YOU CAN SEE THAT REDUCTION WOULD JUST THE TEN PERCENT INCREASE INCREASE COVER WHICH IS REALLY QUITE AMAZING THERE'S RENDON THESE ARE VERY CAREFULLY DONE STUDIES THAT. I FIND DIFFICULT THREE BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE. AND ONE OF THE MOST RECENT STUDIES COMES FROM BRITAIN AND IT. DEALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH SO WE KNOW THAT. RICH PEOPLE ON THE WHOLE ARE GENERALLY HEALTHIER THAN. POOR PEOPLE RIGHT. BUT. WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO URBAN TREES IN URBAN GREENSPACE THAT DISPARITY NARROWS AND IN FACT IT'S A FORTY PERCENT DIFFERENCE IN DISPARITIES? SO GIVEN THAT. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS ARE OFTEN VERY LIMITED AND GIVEN THAT WE. HAVE THE. ECONOMIC DISPARITIES WE HAVE IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. TREES REPRESENT THIS IDEA OF AN EQUITY GENIC ENVIRONMENT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO REDUCE THE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES. NOW TO ACHIEVE ALL THIS. OF WE HAVE TO NOT ONLY PLANT TREES BUT MAKE SURE THOSE TREES SURVIVE AND THIS IS WHERE MY COLLEAGUES FROM MARISSA CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT. TEND TO BE GOING AFTER OUT TREES ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THOSE ARE DE INVASIVE FRAUD HOLE BORERS AND SOME. RELATIVELY RECENT TREAT DISEASES UP AND IT'S CERTAIN IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE TREE CANOPY WE SEE TODAY. IS THE RESULT OF PAST MANAGEMENT SO IF YOU WALK. THROUGH. DOWNTOWN AND MIDTOWN SACRAMENTO YOU'RE REALLY SEEING THE EFFORTS OF URBAN FORESTERS FROM A LONG TIME AGO. SO. IT'S REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT ONLY CONTINUE PLANTING TREES BUT CONTINUE FINDING WAYS TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THE FACT TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW UP PEOPLE COME AFTER US CONCEDED THIS WAS THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA. AND I'M I'M ESPECIALLY MY OWN RESEARCH IS A SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT IN AND. UP TREAT THIS SERVICES NAMELY WHAT HAPPENS WITH TREES FAILING HOW WE CAN REDUCE THAT. TREAT FAILURE BUT ALSO HOW WE TRANSITION INTO THIS REALLY ENVISIONED INFRASTRUCTURE ABOUT MARRYING MENTION WHERE WE USE AT LEAST THREE NEW SOURCES OF WATER GRAY WATER RECYCLED WATER AND STORING WATER. TO SUPPLY WATER NEEDS OF TREES. SO. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS MORE COMPLEX IN OUR URBAN FOREST AND THAT'S OKAY. BECAUSE THEY WILL ALSO GET MORE SUSTAINABLE AND BETTER PERFORMING OVERALL. SO. YOU HAVE EXPECT QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THINK YOU. THANK YOU AND. AS AS I WORK APPEAR I'M ALWAYS THINKIN ABOUT YOU KNOW I THINK GENERALLY THE LEGISLATURE'S ALWAYS WORK IN WAYS THAT. STRENGTH IN THE FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER IT BE THROUGH FOR HOUSING OR HEALTH CARE FOR BETTER SCHOOLS. DENIES AS I LOOK BACK THINKING IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED WE'VE ALWAYS PUT SOME KIND OF THE YOU KNOW WATER BOND WE HAVE SOME KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL. ASPECT TO THE WATER BOND THAT COVERS A. CAPTURING MORE GREEN SPACE ACROSS THE STATE IN PRESERVING AND FOR FUTURE YEARS. I IN MY DISTRICT AYE AYE AYE LARGELY SERVE. A LOWER INCOME DISTRICT. YOU KNOW GENERALLY. I DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT EVEN IN THOSE AREAS PEOPLE WANNA SEE MORE LAND PRESERVE. FOR OUR OPEN SPACE. AND AND. YOU KNOW WHAT WERE WERE DEFINITELY. WORKING ON THAT THROUGH OUR WATER BOND TO PARKS BOND THAT WAS PUTTING FORWARD I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT. A GREAT PROGRAM ABOUT GENERAL ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS WE DO THAT WERE WERE PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IT IS ALWAYS. WRITTEN INTO ANY KIND OF INITIATIVE THAT WE WORK ON. IN ANY AREA OF OF WHETHER IT BE EDUCATION OR ALL THOSE AREAS HAVE MEANT A MENTION. I'M WORKING ON A BILL RICK REGARDLESS PROMISE OWNS AND AND AND NEW. THE I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS WORKING ON. OUR OPPORTUNITIES OWNS A NEW PROGRAM OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GONNA HELP REIMBURSEMENT UNDERSERVED AREAS. AND WE'RE WORKING ON ON MAKING THAT HAPPEN. AND AND IT IT'S. YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO SEE. A LESS MONEY BEING SPENT ON. ON ON ON REPEATING KIND OF THE SAME. HA OR OR OR JUST FINDING WAYS TO NAVIGATE WITH BUREAUCRACY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF LEVELS OF BUREAUCRACY OUR STATE OFTENTIMES. THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR RESOURCES GET GET CAUGHT UP IN LIKE WHO'S WHO WHOSE PER WHO'S ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM VERSES THAT PROGRAM. AND IF YOU WANT TO DO SOME KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD REINVESTMENT EFFORT WHO YOU GO TO THEM YOU HAVE TO GO TO HARD FOR SOME FUNDS YOU HAVE TO GO TO. ENERGY COMMISSION FOR GRANTS WHICH HE GETS ITS IT GETS VERY COMPLICATED AND A NICE TO SEE. THAT THERE BE A SOME. I KNOW THIS OFTEN FIND FALLS ON THE LOCALS TO SAY LET'S. COME UP WITH THE LOCAL ICE PROGRAM. AND AND AS I AND I PUSH A BILL THAT TRIES TO WORK LOCALS TO SAY LET'S LET'S PRIORITIZE FUNDING IN AREAS WHERE WE WANT TO SEE. KIND OF THE THE THE. THE MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES GET UP NOW. ADEQUATE SHARE OF RESOURCES. HOW DO WE DO ABOOT DO BETTER JOB OF THAT I MEAN? I MEAN IS THE STATE. TENDS TO BE A DAUNTING PLACE TO FOR FOR LOCAL LOOK AT AND SAY HOW DO WE. PARTNER WHAT THE STATE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO SPEND THE MAJORITY OF OUR TIME NAVIGATING. THE BUREAUCRACY WE WANT WE WANT TO HEAR MARK THIS MONEY. WE WANNA GOOD TO GO TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IT'S OFTEN HARDER TO INVEST MONEY THAT UNDERSERVED AREAS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH FIRST. RIGHT THERE ISN'T A WAY TO SUSTAIN IF WE PLANT TREES WHO'S GOING TO WATER THEM WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. AND OFTEN TIMES THERE ARE. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MENTION URBAN CORE. THEY'RE THE ONES HE OFTEN GO AND PLANTED TREES AND SOMETIMES TAKE CARE OF THEM BUT THEY NEED A FUNDING SOURCE IF WE PROVIDE THAT FUNDING SOURCE. IF WE PROVIDE MATCHING MONEY TO OUR PARKS PUNK HOW CAN WE DO BETTER. HOW CAN WE? DO A BETTER DELIVERY OF OF OF. SERVICE A FUNDING. AND AND EVERYTHING AS A WHOLE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT. DON'T THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE REALLY GOING TO THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND MAKE THE TAKE MAKE. THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR SHAUNA. YES AND I'M ACTUALLY SO GLAD YOU RAISED THAT. NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THESE FUNDS WENT INTO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT THERE ARE MANY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT EITHER DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM. DO COULDN'T TAKE ON THE REIMBURSEMENT AYE RESPONSIBILITY IS. THE LIABILITY I DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY SHIRLEY RIGHT THERE GRANTED THERE SO MANY BARRIERS TO APPLICATION FOR UNDERSTOOD RESOURCE COMMUNITIES. IT'S NOT IN THIS PROGRAM BUT I WE ARE SPONSORING A BELL WITH SOME PARTNERS I'M IN THE AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY TWO THAT IS ABOUT BUILDING REGIONAL CAPACITY AND IT'S ABOUT GIVING FUNDING TO REGIONS SO THAT THEY CAN BUILD THEIR OWN CAPACITY. THIS TAKES PLANNING THE STATE'S ACTUAL STAFF THIS TAKES A BUDGET SERVER CONSULTANT SUPPORT TO HELP WITH THE GREENHOUSE GAS QUANTIFICATION THAN OTHER TECHNICAL P. SAYS. THEY'RE ALL OF THESE AYE CAPACITY THAT IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY COMPETE FOR STATE FUNDS IT NOT ENOUGH RIGHT I THINK YOUR POINT IS IS RIGHT ON POINT IN TERMS OF IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO DESIGNATE DESIGNATE FUNDS TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AND ESSENTIAL WE ALSO NOW HAVE TO GO IN AND MAKE SURE WE'RE INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND COMPETE FOR FUNDS. AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE STATE HAS SUFFICIENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND STREAMLINING AND ALIGNING THEIR PROGRAM GUIDELINES AND APPLICATION TIMELINES AND REQUIREMENTS. I'M SO I THINK THERE'S THE ROLE OF WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES ON THE GROUND AND REALLY INCREASING THAT CAPACITY AND THE ROLE OF STREAMLINING AND MAKING SURE OUR STATE PROCESSES ARE AS. YOU'RE NOW STREAMLINED AND USER FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE. AND SO AGAIN NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT THERE WE ARE WORKING ON A BILL THAT WOULD DO SOME OF THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND. AND DOING THINGS THE WAY WE'VE DONE THEM PASSED MEAN THAT MONEY WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO APPLY FOR THEM VERSES ALL THE OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE MONEY JUST AS BAD IF NOT WORSE. AND. THAT'S THAT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR THAT I WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR THAT BILL SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT IT LOOK AT IT TO MAKE SURE IT'S IT ACCOMPLISHES SCHOOL. AND ALSO YOU KNOW I REPRESENT. IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE. CITIES WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION. YOU KNOW ON SENDING WILL COUNTY ONE OF THE WORSE IS PARTY LOGAN BECAUSE OF THE PORT. EMISSIONS AND DOES. NEIGHBORHOODS ALSO TEND TO BE PARK DEFICIENT. TREAT EFFICIENT. AND. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO. CRITICS THEY PROGRAM HERE THAT REALLY TARGETS PUTTING TREES IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. EL CENTRO IS ANOTHER ONE CUT CALEXICO IN AGAIN. I GO TO THOSE. NEIGHBORHOODS AS WELL AND THE VERY TREE DEFICIENT. AND THEY ALSO TEND TO HAVE OTHER PARTICULATE MATTER THERE. THAT COME FROM AGRICULTURE SO THOSE ARE ALL THE CHALLENGES EIGHT THE DEAL BUT THEY WOULD NICE. TO IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE. US ARE TO OUR OUR PRIORITIZATION PROCESS OF FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WE TARGET THOSE FUNDS FOR COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE REALLY POOR AIR QUALITY WILL WE HAVE A HIGH ASTHMA RATES. AND WERE. ALTHOUGH WE'RE DEALING WITH SOME OF SOLUTIONS OF. ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THAT PICKED PARTICULAR MATTER IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THAT THAT COULD BE. ONE OF THAT THE REMEDIES TO HELP US ACCOMPLISH ON THE TREES. AND I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW WE CAN. WORK TO DEVELOP MORE. HERE BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WERE INFORMATIVE. AND ALSO VERY ENCOURAGING I HAD NO IDEA WHERE INVESTING THIS MONEY MATURE TREES. I WAS A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBERS AND YOU KNOW WE WE HAD A VERY AGGRESSIVE LOCAL PROGRAM. I PLANNING TREES OUT THERE AND. I I'VE ALWAYS. BEEN EXTREMELY OPPOSED PROJECTS THAT. SOMEHOW HAVE THAT THAT THAT THE. THE EFFECT OF REMOVING TREES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT WE GOTTA. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. IT INTO IN IN DOING NEW PROJECTS AND AND PROPOSING FUTURE PROJECTS THAT THEY INCORPORATE INCORPORATE GREEN AREAS ESPECIALLY THOSE UNDERSERVED AREA SO. THIS WAS VERY FORMATIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE. ONE ATTACK ON. I JUST HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL COMMENT ENTRIES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL THESE REASONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FIRST BUFFERING FOR POLLUTION ETCETERA. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE NEED TO LEARN FROM IS IS THE DROUGHT THAT WE HAD A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE. GET THE MESSAGE OUT RIGHT AWAY THAT WHEN WE SAY TURN OFF THE WATER TO THE LONG WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE TREES AND THAT WE HAVE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING SILICON VALLEY IN THE STATE TO HAVE. NEW HIGH TECH WAYS OF TAKING CARE OF WATER INTO THE AWARDING ENOUGH AND NOT TOO MUCH AND IT'S NOT RUNNING DOWN THE DRAIN. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE SOLUTIONS THAT LEVERAGE HOW ONLY MAINTAINING THESE TREES IN THIS. ARID ENVIRONMENT IF WE'RE GONNA LIVE HERE. THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH MY QUESTION IS I MEAN KNOW IF THERE'S A BALLPARK. FIGURE A NUMBER RIGHT THAT THAT WE'VE ESTIMATED. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE THE IMMEDIATE NEED TODAY I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. AND THE. AMOUNT OF GRANTS THAT WERE AWARDED VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF APPLICATIONS THAT CAME IN. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION ISN'T. EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT I THINK WE ESTIMATE IS NEEDED DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY OF. IDEA WHAT THAT BALLPARK FIGURE MAY LOOK LIKE. WELL. THE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM WAS OVER SUBSCRIBE BY FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. SO AND AND YOU YOU ALSO NEED TO KNOW THAT THEIR BEEN FORCED TO PROGRAM I THINK IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST OF THE. CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS. WHERE THE SECOND SMALLEST? SO WERE I HAD TO MAKE A BAD PUN BUT WE DO IT ALL TIME WHERE DROP IN THE BUCKET AS FAR AS. THE SHORES WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE BUDGET AND WE COULD DO A LOT MORE IF THAT AMOUNT WERE. TRIPLED. THEN IT'S WHY I MENTION RIGHT THAT THE. MONEY IN THE PAST PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT. AND WASN'T TOO REPLACE WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND I WANNA. AND CONTINUE TO HIT THAT HARD IN TERMS OF. GETTING COLLECTIVE SUPPORT. AS THE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE. INSULT YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT ON THAT WOULD BE VERY CRITICAL TO GETTING THAT MESSAGE ACROSS. IT CENTER BUT IF I CAN ALSO ADD SOME COMMENTS. AND I'LL A HISTORICALLY WHEN THE FIRST EUROPEANS CAME CALIFORNIA. THERE WERE THERE WERE. PINE. TREFOREST AS FAR AS THE MIDDLE PENINSULA OF BAJA CALIFORNIA. AND. YOU KNOW THE WE WERE I REPRESENT SAN DIEGO WHICH IS FAMOUS FOR TORY PINE WHICH IS KIND OF THE THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND COASTAL. PINE TREE THAT. IS THREATENED. AND THE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD OUT THERE IN JULIAN FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DECIMATED. OR PINE. WOULD FORCE OUT THERE WERE SCIENTISTS PREDICT IT'LL NEVER REGENERATE. THE LAST DROUGHT HAS CAUSED. THIS INFESTATION OF BEETLE IN THE PINE TREES UP THERE IN THE MOUNTAINS. THAT HAVE AFFECTED NOT THOUSANDS OF TREES MILLIONS OF TREES. AND AS MANY AS WERE PLANTED. WE REALLY CAN'T BACK FILL THE MUCH THAT HAS. BEEN LOST THROUGH THIS DROUGHT AND NATURAL FIRE. PROCESS THAT IS REALLY DEVASTATING THE AMOUNT OF TREES IN OUR STATE. I MEAN DOES NOT FOR LONG IS BEING ERODED ALMOST LIKE A CANCER ACROSS THE STATE GOING UP THIS FAR NORTH. SHASTA COUNTY WE SAW THE FIRES LA COUNTY NAPA THAT THIS IS THIS. I MEAN. IN THE END YOU KNOW IN IN YOUR PRESENTATION VERY LITTLE WAS MENTIONED ABOUT. THE DEVASTATION OUR FORESTS AND HOW THAT IS IS IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON OUR QUALITY ACROSS THE STATE. WAY BEYOND JUST THOSE AREAS THAT ARE A CHALLENGE BY REGULAR. YOU KNOW A LOCALIZED EMISSIONS SUTTER CREEK POOR AIR QUALITY. I MEAN WHY HOW MUCH. OF THIS PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY MAKING. A DENT IN FIVE AT LEAST BACK FEELING WHAT WAS LOST IN TWO WE KNOW. PERCENTAGE WISE. YEAH AND TERMS OF QUANTITY OF OF. TREES LOST IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IT TRYING TO RESTORE THAT EVEN IF IT'S DONE AT A LOCAL LEVEL NOT URBAN I SAID HE'D. I KNOW. KILL FIRE WAS HERE AND. APPRECIATED THE COMMENTS BY MR. HANG BUT. DEWEY DO WE HAVE A OF FIGURE TERMS OF. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT FOR SOME TO SAY MEASURE CERTAIN QUANTITY THE QUANTITY OF TREASON IN JUST. I KNOW WE CAN'T. THE CHALLENGE. I MEAN MEASURING SEQUESTRATION INSULAR CARBON SEQUESTRATION DIFFERENT. I'M THE SAME QUANTITY OF TREES WILL LIMIT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT OUR STATE IN TERMS OF LOSSES. VERSES GAINES. THE UPPER I COULD VOLUNTEER ANNOUNCER TWO TO ONE PART OF THE EQUATION. WE HAVE TWO DATES THE OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES ARE. ARE DEAD THE THREE SOLD THE TEAM ONCOLOGY AND AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IN THE SENSE THAT SOME ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN. URBAN TREES AND. TREES IN IN THE FOREST. AB DID THEIR OLD TREES AND THEY'LL DIE FROM THE SAME DISEASES. WE DON'T HAVE. AND ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF TREES IN TOTAL. AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE AT MY FINGERTIPS. BUT I THINK PART OF THE EQUATION WITH. TREE MORTALITY ISSUE IS NOT SO MUCH. TRY TO REPLANT EVERY TREE THAT DIED. BUT RATHER FOCUSING ON. MANAGEMENT'S OF FOREST THAT MAKES TO TREES MORE RESILIENT. THAT MAY JUST MEAN. FEWER TREES PER ACRE BUT THE ONES THAT ARE LEFT. ARE. MORE ARE ARE BETTER ABLE TO UTILIZE TO TOTAL AMOUNT THE NUTRIENTS ON WATER ON THE SITE AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE. AND AYE I THINK IGOR COULD EXPAND ON THIS AS WELL. BUT. THANK YOU HELL YEAH I I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT IT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE SOME OF THAT. WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT BELIEVES FOREST IN THE SIERRA. WILL ULTIMATELY RECOVER TO SOMETHING SO CERTAINLY. ACTIVE PLANTINGS NEEDED AND AND THAT'S HOW YOU POINTED OUT IT DOES FORCE MAY NOT LOOK LIKE WOULD USE TO LOOK LIKE. BUT THEY CAN STILL BE HEALTHY PRODUCTIVE PROVIDE A WHOLE SET OF BENEFITS AND. MANY OF THOSE BENEFITS REALLY ARE ECOLOGICAL RIGHT. HABITAT THEIR THEIR BENEFITS TO OTHER. LIVING ORGANISMS WHEREAS IN CITIES WITHOUT. CONTINUED ACTIVE MANAGEMENT WITHOUT CONTINUED PLANTING WE ARE. PRETTY MUCH GOING TO CONTINUE ON A WRONG TRAJECTORY WHICH IS THAT WE KEEP LOSING CANOPY AND THAT'S THE SORT OF BIG DIFFERENCE CONCEPTUALLY BETWEEN. NATURAL FORESTS IN OVER FORCE ROOM FOR US REALLY BECOME AN ACTIVE MANAGEMENT BY. PEOPLE LOCAL. CREE MANIFESTLY BENEFIT ORGANIZATIONS UP. NATURAL FOREST YOU KNOW YOU COULD ACTUALLY REPLANT AND WALK AWAY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO IT IN AN URBAN FOREST. THE OTHER THING TO KIND OF KEEP IN MIND IS THAT. IN. METAPHORS ARE SELDOM CONVERSION OF TYPE IN OTHER WORDS SOMETHINGTHAT USED TO BE A FOREST AGAIN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PROPER MANAGEMENT IS LIKELY TO STAY A FOREST. IN CITIES AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THIS INTUITIVELY ONCE THE TREES REMOVED THERE'S NO GUARANTEE IT'S GOING TO BE A REPLY BUT RIGHT CAN JUST BE PAVED OVER BECAUSE SOMEBODY NEEDS TO PARK ANOTHER CAR. YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT TREE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. THAT'S THE SORT OF BIG DIFFERENCE I THINK WE WE. WANT TO KIND OF. KEEP OUR FOCUS ON. URBAN TREES SIMPLY BECAUSE IF WE. TAKE OUR EYES OFF OF THEM REALLY THINGS KIND OF GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MORTALITY SO THE. COLTS WATER OAK BORER THAT CERTAIN AND THAT WHILE THE MARIN INTERFACE INVASIVE SHUTTLE BOARDS THAT ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE FROM. YES CENTER CITIES ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE WILDLINGS ALL THOSE THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS UNFORTUNATELY WRONG DIRECTION. INFANTRY CANOPY SO THAT'S THE SORT OF I WOULD SORT OF THINK OF IT THAT WAY. HELP IS OF COURSE COMPLETELY RIGHT TREES  <u><c.green>TREES AND I</c></u> THINK WE IN THIS ROOM ALL WHITE OLD TREES. IT'S JUST THAT. SOME TREES ARE HAVING A TOUGHER TIME JUST BY DESIGN AND THOSE ARE THE URBAN TREES. IF I CAN JUMP IN AS WELL I THINK. PARTOF WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING IS A SWIFT MOVE FOR MORE INVESTMENT AND. PRACTICES. IN FIGHTING FIRES AYE AND AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN TO THE SPACE OF LEVELING OUT CONSERVATION EFFORTS AROUND FORCED ENTRY IS. WHICH IS JUSTICE IN CENTRAL THE STRATEGY AND PREPARING AYE FOR OUR NEW NORMAL IN TERMS OF CLIMATE IMPACTS THE OTHER THING I WOULD MENTION IS. ON FUNDING THE PLANT TREES IS. AT HIGHER LEVELS THAN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FUNDS FOR TREES. AND WE NEED TO ESPECIALLY AS AS PROGRAMS LIKE CAPITA TRADE BEGAN TO BE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE AND WE NEED TO START MAKING THAT A MORE ELIGIBLE PERCENTAGE OF I'VE PROJECT ALLOCATION COSTS SO THAT. I IT IT TO BE A HUGE BURDEN FOR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE RUNNING THE PLANT AND THEN TO REALLY STRUGGLE TO FIND A FUNDING TO AT MAINTAIN AND. AND SUPPORT. THEIR TREES LOCALLY SO I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO START TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR PEACE IN THE FORMULA AND I ALSO JUST WANTED TO. I RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION CHAIRMAN GARCIA AS WELL AROUND THE CLOCK STE WHAT WOULD IT COST TO DO THIS LEVEL OF BRIDES BACK TO SPREAD GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSFORMATION. WE DON'T HAVE GOOD NUMBERS ON THAT WE DO HAVE SOME COMMUNITIES WHO'VE DONE THEIR OWN LOCAL KIND A NEEDS ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS ON THE ONE THAT KIND OF IS ISN'T THE MOST RECENT HAS BEEN LA COUNTY. WHICH ASSESSED A NEED FOR GREEN SPACE REGIONALLY AT OVER TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS JUST FOR THE COUNTY OF LA. SO. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHOLE STATE NEEDS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S THE PRICE TAG TO REALLY TRANSFORM INFRASTRUCTURE STATEWIDE BUT WE DO KNOW THERE ARE SOME LOCALS JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE DONE SOME OF THAT ANALYSIS. AND THAT WAS JUST BASED ON GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WASN'T BASED ON WATER NEEDS ARE SOME OF THE OTHER MULTIPLE BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT WILL ASK THAT THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE SPEAKING. AT TO PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. ORGANIZATION YOU MAY BE AFFILIATED IF ANY. AND IF YOU COULD JUST KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO YOU KNOW MAYBE A MINUTE OR SO CONSIDERING THAT THERE ARE. A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SPEAK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BALTO SAYING SACRAMENTO REGIONAL CONSERVATION CORPS I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR TRAINING PROGRAM. I'M HERE TO TOUCH UPON THAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ASPECT. OF FOR BOTH THE EVAN GRINNING AS WELL AS THE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAMS. BETTER FOURTEEN LOCAL CERTIFIED CONSERVATION BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND EACH ONE OF THEM. ARE WORKING ON VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT WOULD AGE TO HAVE BEEN GRINNING ALL EVAN FORESTRY. THIS PARTICULAR PROJECTS UP PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE YOUNG ADULTS. TO. GAIN JOB SKILLS. AND. ALSO. THIS PROJECT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT AS WE HEAD THAT MOST OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT GOES AND UNDERSERVED O.. UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES AND MOST OF OUR PARTICIPANTS GONE FROM THE SERIOUS. SACRAMENTO REGIONAL COIL. CONSERVATION GO IS A RECIPIENT OF QUALIFY A GUN. PLANTING NOW FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX TREES AND MARYSVILLE WORKING WITH THAT THE COUNTY CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND OTHER AGENCIES AND IN SACRAMENTO. ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE GOING IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. WHICH I DISADVANTAGED AND WE ARE TREES ARE NEEDED. THEY ARE TALKING TO THE POTENTIAL TREE RECIPIENTS. AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHY THEY NEED TREES. AND WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THE TREES AND HOW TO LOCATE THE TREES. BUT WHAT WAS DEVELOPMENT THAT THE COURTS ARE GAINING FROM IS OUT. LANDING THE JOB SKILLS BY NOT ONLY PROBABLY PACKING THE TREES. GETTING THE SKILLS TO BE PROPER. GETTING PROPER KNOWLEDGE OF UPPER CULTURAL INFORMATION. THE IRRIGATION TECHNICIANS. ARE BRINGING. AND OTHER TREE CARE SO THEY'RE ABLE TO ENTER JOB MARKETS THAT ARE PROVIDING JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE MORE SUBSTANTIAL RATHER THAN JUST ENTRY LEVEL JOBS. WE ARE HELPING THIS PARTICIPANTS TO ENTER INTO A JOB MARKET SUGGEST PAYING SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. SO THEY HAD A PURPOSE SUSTAIN AND AND PAYING TO MORE SUSTAINABLE OPPORTUNITIES IN YEARS TO COME SO THIS PROGRAMS ARE BENEFITING THE BECAUSE GREATLY.

GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL LYNCH ON BEHALF OF THE LOTS THAT ANGELES NEIGHBORHOOD LAND TRUST I AM WE ARE A LA BASED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION WHO. AYE IS FOCUSED ON CREATING PARKS AND IT AYE GREEN SPACES AND COMMUNITY GARDENS ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND I WON'T REPEAT AYE THE COMMENTS THAT MISS ALVES MADE IN REGARDS TO THE WISHING TREE PARK PROJECT THAT WE ARE FORTUNATE TO RECEIVE. AN AWARD FOR BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT AS WE ARE WITH. ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WE WORK ON BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A COMMUNITY PROJECTWE MAKE SURE THAT WE ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY AND. IDENTIFYING WHERE THESE PROJECTS ARE NEEDED HOW THEY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHAT THE FOCUS OF EACH PARK SHOULD BE. AND THEN IN BUILDINGS DO WORDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PARKS CONTINUE TO THRIVE AND BE USED IN THE FUTURE. SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED FOR. FOR BEING ABLE TO OFFER THIS PARK TO THE COMMUNITY I'M IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR COMMENTS REGARDING PASSED THE FIVE AND THAT THAT. POLICY WAS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE CONTINUED URBAN GREENING INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A TON OF PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL NEEDED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE'RE EXCITED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO. URGE THAT. CONTINUED URBAN GRINNING FUNDING CONTINUES TO BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE CITY IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA MY NAME IS ELEANOR TORRANCE FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM A RESIDENT FROM A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS A BUSINESS OWNER OF A DISADVANTAGE MEDIA HAVE ARCHITECTURAL IN PLANNING FIRM WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. I'M HERE IN THE CAPACITY AS THE IN. THERE'S THE CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INCREDIBLE EDIBLE COMMUNITY GARDENS A RECIPIENT OF THREE G. DE ARROZ GRANTS. TOLL OF FORTY TWO HUNDRED TREES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WERE PLANTING. AND WE ARE A TRAINEE THAT TEAM THAT CARES ABOUT OUR TREES. OUR FIRST ROUND GRANTS WERE FOR NEIGHBORHOOD GOAT BUT DAVID GROWS GRANT AS A MEANS TO BUILD GREATER CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE. IT PROVIDE SMALL GRANTS TO TRAIN COMMUNITIES IN THE COMPETITION IN THE COMPETITIVENESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF GIGI OR OF GRANTS. A GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNICIAN TRAINING THE TEACHERS HOW TO CALCULATE CARBON SEQUESTRATIONTHE VALLEY WITH THE HELP OF TREES. AND THE RIGHT TREE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS OUR TRAINEES IN ENTRANCE RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS DOUR AND WE CONTRACT DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE COMMUNITIES TO ALSO WORK WITH US. NONE OF OUR STAFF RECEIVES A. A A SALARY. WE'RE DOING THIS AS A VOLATILITY BASED GROUP WE MAKE SURE ALL THE MONEY GOES TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES. OUR VOLUNTEERS IN TRAINEES UNDERSTAND URBAN FORESTRY IT'S BECOMING A. REALLY IMPORTANT THING IN OUR COMMUNITY THEY UNDERSTAND THAT AS BEING THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE EXPRESSED. THE IMPORTANCE AND THE DIFFERENCE OF URBAN FORESTRY. VERSUS TRADITIONAL FORESTRY. THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE ROUTE SIXTY SIX VETERANS MEMORIAL CORRIDOR WHICH PROVIDES A TREE FOR A VETERAN LIVING OR DECEASED. ACTIVE DUTY OR NOT. WHO ACTUALLY HAS A MARKER ON EACH OF THE TREES? ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE PROVED TO BE BEYOND JUST THE COSTS OF THE THE BENEFITS OF THE TREES CHO BENEFITS ARE FABULOUS. OF WE ARE SEEING INCREDIBLE WAYS WE CAN LEVERAGE THINKS. BUT WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING IS THE SCIENCE THAT WERE ABLE TO APPROACH THESE TREES AND HOW WE CAN EDUCATE AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. TO DO THE SAME THING AND BUILD GREATER CAPACITY THIS IS WHERE WE'VE SEEN THE GREATEST USE OF THE SCRIPT. FINALLY THE REASON WHY I'M HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE. I HAD BEEN INVITED THE BUT HAD BEEN DISINVITED BECAUSE IT WAS A DETERMINE THAT. SOMEONE FROM THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY SHOULD BE. TESTIFYING WITH YOU BUT. MY COMMUNITY WAS REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE INLAND EMPIRE RARELY GETS A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO TALK. AYE I AM FORTUNATE I'M ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. BUT. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WE HAVE THE LARGEST LAND MASS IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. AND WE HAVE PRE MERE PROGRAMS THAT WERE WORKING WITH TOGETHER LIKE WITH THE CITY OF COMPTON ACCOMPANIED COLTON TO. TO WORK TO REALLY MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER TO BRING JOBS TO BRING MORE ECONOMIC HEALTH TO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT THE TABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA I JUST WANTED TO SHARE A STORY ABOUT THE CITY OF COLTON. WE ARE FIFTY TWO THOUSAND AYE POPULATION A DAC DISADVANTAGED NINETIETH PERCENTILE ARE AT THE CALAVERAS SCREEN SCORE AND WE WENT AFTER THESE FUNDS BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED THE DEVASTATION OF HAVING. EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO TURN OFF YOUR WATER WITHOUT THINKING OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE TREES SELF SEVERAL OF OUR URBAN FOREST DIED IMMEDIATELY AND WITH THE DROUGHT COLTON'S UNIQUE WE GET ALL OUR WATER STRAIGHT FROM THE GROUND SO WHEN THE DROUGHT OCCURRED ALL OF OUR. MATURE TREES THAT HAD DEEP ROOTS DIED. AND THEY ALSO GOT IMPACT DID. AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED FROM A LOT OF DISEASE SO THE TREES THAT ARE ALIVE TODAY THEY HAVE A LOT OF. MARK DAMAGED AND. THEY'RE CALLED CLUNK MOLDS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE ROOTS. AT THIS POINT THEY'RE HAZARDOUS TO OUR RESIDENTS AND THEY HAVE TO BE REMOVED SO IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GET IN URBAN FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PLAN BECAUSE. THAT PLAN EDUCATE SOME CHANGES ARE ORGAN SAYS SO THAT THERE IS A STATE ABILITY OF THAT URBAN FOREST SO THAT IT CONTINUES TO SEQUESTER CARBON AND THAT WE CAN HAVE A WHOLE. STOP BUT THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IN OUR CITY WE ARE ONLY AT A SEVEN PERCENT CANOPY. BUT WE WILL BE AT A THIRTY PERCENT HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS JUST BY THAT MASSIVE EFFORT OF TREE PLANTING AND CHANGES IN OUR ORDINANCE SAYS AND JUST WHAT TYPES OF TREES TO PLANT. AND 嫑T OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WE WILL NO LONGER PLANT PALM TREES THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO ANYBODY THEY DO NOT PROVIDE SHADE DROP PROVIDE HABITATS IN THEY'RE NOT CARBON SICK QUESTION. AND ACTUALLY IN THE CATEGORY AS GRASSES SO THAT IS BEEN AN ENTIRE NEW EDUCATION OUTREACH FOR COMMUNITY IS JUST WHAT TO PLANT AND DIVERSITY YOU NEVER WANNA PLANT SAME TRINA ROWE IN A MEDIAN. BECAUSE IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ONE THE DISEASE WILL CARRY OUT TO THE OTHER AT NEW BOSTON ENTIRE STRING OF TREES. SO IT'S BEEN AN EXCITING TIME AND WE HOPE THAT THESE FUNDS WILL CONTINUE TO COME DOWN TO OUR NECK OF THE WOODS WE HAVE A LARGE OF PROJECT. AHEAD OF US BEEN DISADVANTAGED WE DON'T HAVE FUNDING TO MATCH AND WE DON'T HAVE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS. BUT WE DO HAVE. AT LEAST THE WELL TO TRY. THINK IT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THINKING FOR DIFFERENT AND I'M GONNA READ JUST MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T MISS IMPORTANT POINTS HERE. IMPETUS I CAN LOG ON THE PRINCIPLE IT IS TOO DUMB LA. LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE FIRM BASED IN AND LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO. COMMITTED TO CREATING VIBRANT RESILIENT PLACES FOR DESIGN AND ADVOCACY I URGE YOU TO MAINTAIN GROW THIS URBAN GRINNING AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROGRAMS AS VITAL. RESOURCES TO INVESTING IN LOW INCOME. AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH MULTI BENEFIT GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. WHERE BLIGHTED COMMUNITIES ONCE COLLECTED TRASH POLLUTION IN CRIME THEIR KNOWLEDGE TREE LINE STREETS? A FUTURE IN THE AIR AND WATER AND ATTRACTING LIFE AND COMMUNITY WHERE ALSO IT MOVES PRETTY THAT HEAT AND COLLECTED. PARTICULATES THERE ARE NOW CHILDREN PLAYING NATURAL LANDSCAPES. AND SHE'D BEEN IN KUWAIT SHE'S INSPIRED BY THE WILDLIFE AROUND THEM. THIS PROGRAMS PROVIDE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE MOBILITY HEALTH. AND THE SAFETY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS MOST IN NEED OF INVESTMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOPE. THIS PROGRAMS REDUCE THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT CAPTIONING IN OUR WATER SEQUESTER CARBON INCLUDE ALL WHERE PROVIDE ACTIVE LEAVING AND COME BACK ILLNESS AND OBESITY. AND ARE KEY TO BUILDING A RESILIENT HEALTH FUTURE FOR ALL OF US THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AARON EVANS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES HERE TO LEND OUR SUPPORT FOR THE URBAN GRINNING AND URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAMS. AS THE STATE WORKS TOWARDS ACHIEVING ITS CLIMATE CHANGE ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS WE NOW THAT CITIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERS IN THAT EFFORT. I'M IN FACT. THIS PROGRAM THESE PROGRAMS REALLY ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF THE COLLABORATION THAT CAN BE FORGED BETWEEN THE STATE LEVEL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND WE'VE SEEN THIS IN MULTIPLE WAYS FOR EXAMPLE. THESE PROGRAMS PROMOTE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE DEVELOPED THAT WILL IMPROVE THE COMMUNITIES. SECOND WE HAVE THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COMMUNITIES BY IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS INCLUDING WITH AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND FINALLY I AS THE STATE BECAUSE OUR HOPES TO UP WHAT WE AS CITIES HOPE TO HELP TO GET CLOSER TO ACHIEVING THE STATE CALLS BY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AS SUCH THESE GRANT PROGRAMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO COMMUNITIES. THAT THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ACCESS FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT SUCH PROGRAMS AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE PROGRAM AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY. MISTER CHAIR MARK FENCE MAKE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA URBAN FOREST COUNCIL. STRONG SUPPORTERS LONGTIME SUPPORTERS OF THE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM AT CAL FIRE. WE SUPPORT OF THE PARK RUN THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS LAST YEAR AND WE AGREE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR THESE DOLLARS AND PARK PLAN BOND SHOULD BE ADDITIVE NOT REPLACEMENTS TO WITH A CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN. AND THE PROGRAM CLEARLY NEEDS IT AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE PROGRAM'S BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED BY FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT LAST YEAR. TO ONE OF THE BEST MOST EFFICIENT JG REDUCTION PROGRAMS ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS. I'M IN JUST ONE AT REFLECT ONE OTHER ECHO ONE COMMENT FROM EARLIER CAN NEED TO START INVESTING IN SOME OF THE TREE MAINTENANCE. THERE'S A LOT OF MENTION OF PASS SHOP HOPE BORDER IT'S A GROWING AND VERY SERIOUS ISSUE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON TRYING TO DRESS. A BIG THREAT TO URBAN POOR SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON TRYING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TORRANCE ON A BIT OF THE DIRECTOR OF ENGAGEMENT EDUCATION OF THE SACK WHEN A TREE FOUNDATIONS SO. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE CANOPY THAT WE HAVE IN THE CITY AND IT IS BASED ON LONG TERM INVESTMENT FROM. ON THE FOUNDERS OF THIS CITY TO TOM OR LOCAL UTILITY AND FROM ON THE STATE I'M CURRENTLY ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF TWO DIFFERENT CAL FIRE GRANTS. ONE ENABLES US TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE CONSERVATION CORPS AND ITS WELL WORN FARMS TO PLANT THREE THOUSAND TREES. ON IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO WHICH IS THE MOST UNDER CANOPY PART OF SACRAMENTO. IN IT ALLOWS US TO DO IT TO A MODEL THAT BUILDS COMMUNITY INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT FOR THAT MODEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THAT YOU ENSURE LONG TERM SURVIVABILITY OF THE TREES. AND ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL MORE IN FRANCHISE BY THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS ACTUALLY QUITE NEAT IT'S SOME FUNDED THROUGH THE GREEN INNOVATIONS PROGRAM IT'S URBAN WOULD RESCUE. SOME PROGRAMS HAVE BASICALLY RIGHT NOW WHEN TREES HAVE TO COME DOWN LIKE MANY OF A MATURE TREES IN SACRAMENTO. THEIR LANDFILL BOUNDS NAM BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING A MAIL IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO SOMEWHERE WE CAN HARVEST THAT WOULD IN SELATAN ARTISANAL MARKET. WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW KEEP THESE TREES THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO THEM CREATES A WHOLE NEW PROFIT CENTER ALLOWS FOR JOBS TO BE CREATED AN INDUSTRY THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED OTHERWISE BECAUSE. YOU KNOW UP UNTIL NOW NOBODY REALLY THOUGHT THIS IS SOMETHING IT DESERVED INVESTMENT BUT FOLKS A CALIFORNIA. THROUGH THIS PROCESS YOU KNOW DREAM THIS UP AND WE'RE INNOVATING SOMETHING THAT WILL CREATE GREATER. EFFICIENCIES SOON ENOUGH FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO REPLICATE SO WITHOUT PROGRAMS LIKE THIS WITHOUT THE THE KNOWLEDGE IN THE WHERE WITH ALL OF OF ORGANIZATIONS LIKE HELLFIRE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS GET STARTED. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS FATIMA AND PUTTING ON A LEAK AND I'M A RESIDENT OF DA PASO HEIGHTS IN OUR SACRAMENTO. OF FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT OF THAT ARE BEGINNING EVAN FOR SHE PROGRAMS. AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN HONOR TO PARTICIPATE IN IN OUR SACRAMENTO THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP THANKS TO THE RELIEF FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE THROUGH THE PLANTING WHAT PURPOSE GRANT. ON THIS THIS COLLABORATIVE. GOING TO SHARE A LOT ABOUT A NOR SACRAMENTO IT'S HISTORICALLY IT DOESN'T DIS INVESTED NEIGHBORHOOD AND SO. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET INVESTMENT. IN IMPROVING THE URBAN GREENING OF PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND BEAUTIFICATION THAT IS NEEDED TO REALLY REHABILITATE OUR COMMUNITY. THAT UPPERSIDES GROWERS ALLIANCE WHICH IS. COMMITTED TO URBAN PLANNING EFFORTS BECAUSE OF THEIR POINTS IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FACTORS THAT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ISN'T DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAS TO DATE PLANTED AT LEAST. SIXTY TREES ARE THIRTY IN ONE PART AND ABOUT TWENTY IN A COMMUNITY GARDEN BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST POINTING SHADE TREES WERE ALSO PLANTING FRUIT TREES. UP BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS IN NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE LIKE THE ONE I LIVE IN A WE GET THIS DOUBLE WHAMMY OF NOT ONLY THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT BUT ALSO THIS WHO DOES IT AS YOU KNOW. AS WE GET REALLY POOR QUALITY FOOD AND JUST POOR QUALITY LIVING ENVIRONMENTS FROM AIR AND FOOD AND JUST EVERYTHING SO IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE LEARN HOW TO. UP POINT SHE'S NOT JUST FOR SHAPE PURPOSES BUT FOR FOOD PURPOSES AS WELL. AND. ALSO. TO SPEAK ON A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I'VE HEARD TODAY IT'S. YOU KNOW ONE BEING NOTIFIED AS THE COMMUNION RAIL THESE OPPORTUNITIES IMPORTANT INTO LEARNING HOW TO EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS SO WE'VE BEEN REALLY HONORED TO HAVE SUPPORT FROM. A LOT OF DIFFERENT NON PROFITS AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF EACH PARTNER'S ROLE SPECIFIC HOUSING INCORPORATED WHICH IS A LOCAL NONPROFIT DEVELOPER. HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE THE THE LEAD AGENCY THAT CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO. BE REIMBURSED FOR THE FINDING THAT. THIS GRANT ALLOWS FOR AND THROUGH THAT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT HAS. PROVIDE PERMISSION TO PLANTS ON THEIR PUBLIC PROPERTY WHICH ARE PUBLIC PARKS AND AS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE CITY PARK DEPARTMENTS HAVE LOW OR NO RESOURCES. TO MAINTAIN THEIR PARTS OF THIS IS A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. AND THEN THE SECOND NOT CHEAT FOUNDATION HAS BEEN INTEGRAL IN HELPING US. RECRUIT VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD AT LEAST LEAST SEVENTY FIVE VOLUNTEERS LAST APRIL WERE PLANNING. TO BIG EVENTS THIS MARCH AND APRIL AS WELL SO WILL CONTINUE THIS ANNUAL EVENT NOW. TO HAVE MORE MORE PEOPLE GET INVOLVED THE JUSTICES NETWORK HAS BEEN AN AMAZING DOT PARTNER. TO HELP US THINK THROUGH JUST HOW DO WE ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY EFFECTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY. AND THEN GREEN TECH GREEN TECHNICAL EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN INTEGRAL IN PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO YOUNG BROWN AND BLACK YOUTH. PREDOMINANTLY OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR I'M EXPOSING THEM TO NOT ONLY LEARNING TREES PLANTING TREES. BUT WE HAVE TEENAGERS WHO HAVE NEVER EVEN EIGHT AN ASIAN PEAR AND TO ME THAT IS A TRAGEDY THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE IN THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO THAT IS TO OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS SO ON I THINK YOU. THANK YOU TERRACE THEATRE CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S URBAN GRINNING IN URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAMS. I'M AS YOU HEARD FOR MY COLLEAGUES THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE A MULTITUDE OF CO BENEFITS PARTICULARLY IN PARK OR. I UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE SUPPORT RESTORING SHOULD EUROPE FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS WHEN THOSE DISCUSSIONS ROLL AROUND. I'M ASKING HEARD THESE PROGRAMS ARE VASTLY OVER SUBSCRIBED. AND OFFER A NUMBER OF BENEFITS TED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND WE LOOK TO SEIZE WITHOUT A FUNDING RESTORED THINKING. HI I'M MARIA DE LEóN WITH THAT GRASSROOTS NONPROFIT CALLED FROM LOT TO SPOT BASED IN LOS ANGELES. WE ARE A. NONPROFIT THAT BUILDS COMMUNITY DESIGNED GREEN SPACES AND ALL THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES AND. WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT REALLY PLEAD YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT A LUXURY FOR OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT'S A DIRE NECESSITY. FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE LENNIX THE COMPANY THAT I GREW UP IN THAT WE WHERE FORTUNATE. ENOUGH TO BE. GRANTED. AN AWARD THROUGH CAL FIRES PROGRAM. TO PLANT SEVENTY FIVE NEW TREES IN THE COMMUNITY OF LENNOX ON FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT FAMILIAR WITH LEN EXITS AN UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITY AND LAW LA COUNTY. AND LIKE OTHER DANCE LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT'S OVER BRING BY POLLUTION POLEMICS LIFE CHILES LOCATED UNDERNEATH THE LANDING PATH OF THE LA ACCENT SURROUNDED BY TO FREEWAYS THERE'S A FROM OIL REFINERY REALLY NEARBY AND. THE OCEAN BREEZE STUFFED. BURDENS LENNIX WITH ARM. INTENSE POLLUTION AND WE DON'T HAVE AN EXISTING TREE CANOPY SO WE WERE ABLE TO PLAN SEVENTY FIVE NEW TREES UP NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT WAS COMMUNITY. WHERE LOCAL STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY WENT DOOR TO DOOR TO CONVINCE RESIDENTS TO ADOPT THE TREES AND WATER THEM WHILE THE COUNTY DID THE LONG TERM MAINTENANCE? ARE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE PROJECT WE WERE RECENTLY FUNDED THROUGH ARE BEGINNING IS AND WHAT'S WHERE WE WILL BE ABLE TO PLANT MORE TREES AS WELL TO INCREASE THE. TOUCHY CANOPY AND SICK. ALSO BUILDING GARDEN SO WILL HELP CAPTURE WATER AND IF WHICH A WATER WITH NATIVE PLANTS BUT THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE REALLY. THE BASIC NECESSITIES ARE NOT. A LUXURY AND WE WE PLEASE THAT YOU SUPPORT THEM THINK. GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID TAO WILL CONCERNED I'M DONE. PRESIDENT OF THE LITTLE ENTRY FOUNDATION NOT JUST ACROSS THE RIVER IN YOLO COUNTY. FOUNDED A TWO YEARS AGO IT'S ALL VOLUNTEER DRIVEN. JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM. VOLUNTEERS ARE PUTTING IT TO GET WORK JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK-EXAMPLES. I WILL BE PLANNING TWELVE HUNDRED TREES AS VOLUNTEERS. ON SATURDAY. AT A MOBILE HOME PARK. THERE WAS A GANG RELATED MURDER ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. COMMUNITIES COMING OUT SATURDAY TO PLANT TREES IN THE. PLAY AREA. THIS'LL INVOLVE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS OUR RESIDENTS SHOWN AND OTHER VOLUNTEERS THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY WERE. PLANNING FIFTY TREES OTHER. PUBLIC HOUSING FACILITY BUILT THE FIFTIES. THAT. HAS A LOT OF OLD DYING TREES IT'LL PROVIDE OFFER SHADE FOR THOSE RESIDENTS. ROTARY IS COMING OUT TO PLANT THOSE TREES. AT KNOW IF YOU KNOW BUT ROTARY UNDER NATIONAL WAS CHALLENGED. EACH SHARE ROTARIAN. A PLAN AT LEAST ONE TREE THIS YEAR. SO AUTRY'S SO AGAIN THANK YOU ARE WE COULD DO IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP. THE CITY'S A BIG PARTNER. SO THE STATE'S RESOURCES ARE LEVERAGING TREMENDOUS VOLUNTEERISM. AND A LOT OF LOCAL DOLLARS TO. KEEP OUR STATE HEALTHY AND GREEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS AND THANK YOU FOR. STAYING WITH US TO THIS AND. LEE HEIRESS WHO TREE FRESNO WE'VE BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY THREE YEARS NOW. AND WE PLANTED OVER FORTY THREE THOUSAND TREES. AND THANKS TO THE FUNDING THAT'S BECOME AVAILABLE THROUGH CALIFORNIA ARE. AND LOCAL INITIATIVES WE HOPE TO REACH FIFTY THOUSAND TREES BEFORE TOO LONG. I WANTED TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP LIKE WHAT WE DO MORE. ALL WE ARE NOW CONDUCTING A TREE INVENTORY AND FRESNO THROUGH CAL FAR GRANT. THAT'S GONNA SHOW WATER TREE LOSSES WERE IN THE PARKS AND ON STREET TREES. AND FOR WHAT I'M HEARING THAT'S GOING TO BE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND. SPROUT IT'S EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. AND THAT DOESN'T BEGIN TO ADDRESS. THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TREES PLANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO IT IS SIGNIFICANT. WELL ONE REASON WHY I'M HERE IS WE BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF THREE GRANTS. FUNDED THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. OF THE FIRST ONE WAS TO CALIFORNIA RELIEF WHERE WE PLAY IT. TREES AT TWELVE DIFFERENT SCHOOL CAMPUSES. AND WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT WE THINK THAT WHEN WE PLANET OF THE SCHOOL ARE OUR ALLIES PROBABLY THE HIGHEST. IS NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE THE PHYSICAL BENEFIT OF THE TREE PUTS AN INSTRUCTIONAL BENEFIT. AS WELL AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ATMOSPHERE FOR LEARNING. AND OFTEN WHEN WE'RE ADDED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. WILL HAVE THIRTY CHILDREN. COMING OUT TO HELP THIS PLANET EACH TREE. AND THE A SOMEWHAT ADOPTED. IN THAT PROCESS AND DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS. BUT THEY ALL APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT'S PLACE FOR BURGER LAND. BUT THEY ALSO ENJOY LEARNING ABOUT THE SPECIES AND WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS ARE GONNA DO. I ALSO WANNA JUST. ADD. TO THE IMPORTANCE OF CANOPY SOMETIMES THESE THINGS CAN MAYBE SEEMED ABSTRACT. YOU HEARD THE REPRESENTATIVE OF. CALIFORNIA OR SPEAK TO FIFTEEN PERCENT STATEWIDE WE JUST HAD A. STUDY DONE OF OUR PARK SYSTEM MANY OF OUR PARKS ONLY HAVE ELEVEN PERCENT. CANOPY. AND WILL WERE PLEASED TO SEE THAT CALIFORNIA IS PART OF THE REVISED MISSION IT'S GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE CANOPY FOR EACH REGION. NOT ENCOURAGE YOU TO FUND THAT AND WEEKLY LIKE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO IMPROVE THAT CANOPY. THANK YOU. TRYING TO STAY WITHIN THE ONE MINUTE TIMEFRAME. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A ONE MINUTE TIMEFRAME. THE THE SCENE WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE WORK IN THAT PRIMARILY IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COACHELLA VALLEY WITH LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES A LOT OF DISADVANTAGE UNINCORPORATED AREAS. AND WE. ECHO EVERYBODY SUPPORT FOR BOTH PROGRAMS EXTRA CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. FOR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ESPECIALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE A PART. POR IT CETERA DID A COUPLE THINGS THAT CAN OF AS THE PROGRAM PROGRESSES WEEKLY SIZE OBSTACLES IN SOME OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED AREAS WAS A REQUIREMENT FOR A FRIEND CUT CAPITAL. ON THAT KEPT SOME FOLKS FROM APPLYING ARE COMPETING AND THEN THE REQUIREMENT FOR ON GOING ME THAT THE LACK OF FLEXIBILITY AROUND ONGOING MAINTENANCE. AND TRYING TO MAKE THAT MORE FLEXIBLE TO ALLOW VOLUNTEER HOURS. TO TO QUALIFY OR ADDED TO COVER THE COSTS OF LIKE ENGINEERING STUDIES SO THAT THERE CAN BE AN ASSESSMENT. SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES SO THAT FOLKS CAN SECURE THE. SOME MECHANISM FOR MAINTENANCE THAT'S NOT BEYOND THEIR REACH. THANKS SO MUCH. ONE OF THE MADONNA WITHOUT ON CALIFORNIA FOR THE REASONS. PREVIOUSLY STATED WE SUPPORT OF THIS PROGRAM IT ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT. THIS PROGRAM REALLY ALLOWS OF FOR OUR IRVINE I AREAS TO HAVE URBAN HABITAT FOR URBAN BIRDS SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THIS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON UNLESS I'M JUST WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. DIRECTOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY AND AS SUCH WE PROMOTE UP PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE PEOPLE PLANET AND PROSPERITY URBAN FORESTRY AND I'VE BEEN READING DO ALL OF THOSE THREE THINGS. AND I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT THAT. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF SUPPORT IN A LOT OF STATISTICS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS. END OF SOBRE SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN CAP AND TRADE REVENUE ONLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS COMBINED. SO A LOT OF GREAT BENEFITS FOR NOT A LOT OF FUNDING. AND I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO JUST HOW MUCH BENEFIT THESE PROGRAMS GENERATE. HOW MY KNEE CHO BENEFITS IT DOES HIGH AND HOW THE INVESTMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT HIGH? SO THE FACT THAT BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS IN THE CURRENT PROPOSAL ARE AT ZERO ISRAELI UNACCEPTABLE. I THINK THAT ALL OF THESE BENEFITS ARE NOT GONNA CONTINUE TO OCCUR IF WE RELY ON S. B. FIVE FUNDING SO THAT'S WHY I'M BRINGING THESE PROGRAMS UP IN THE CURRENT BUDGET CYCLE AND FUTURE CURRENT LAW BUDGET CYCLES AS WITH IMPORTANT. MISTER CHAIRMAN. A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON WE WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR THIS HEARING. AND YOUR PERSONAL INTEREST IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

BOB MANY OF THE THE THINGS THAT ARE WITNESSES OF CITED IN THESE HEARINGS THIS MORNING. AND THE DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTING. ARMED TO THE RECOVERY EFFORT MEANS THAT WE NEED MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY. IN THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO RESTORE A TREE CANOPY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT MEANS A SPECIALLY IT'S FUNDING THAT WILL HELP US MOVE TOWARD DEVELOPING MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS. IT ISN'T ENOUGH TO SAY THAT WE JUST WON'T FUND MAINTENANCE BUT IF AT LEAST WEGOT FUNDING TO HELP US DEVELOP MECHANISMS FOR MAINTENANCE WE CAN DO A LOT MORE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

YOU KNOW I HEAR A LOT OF OF STATISTICS I HEAR A LOT OF YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT CANOPY COVER IT SEPARATES HEADER BUT. REALLY VISCERALLY THIS ALSO HAS A REAL CONNECTION TO HUMANS ON THE GROUND AND THESE ARE REAL PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO COMMUNITIES THAT CAN BE MADE ARE YOU KNOW RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVELY BUT DO NEED TO BE MAINTAINED OVER TIME.
