HAS TO BE AMENDED SB TWO FORTY

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.490

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:50.904
WELL THIS IS MORE WORK FOR CAL

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.472
FIRE CAL FIRE WOULD BE

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.107
REIMBURSED BY THE UTILITY FOR

YOU MUST ALSO CLEAR.

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:42.281
ANY TREE ON ADJACENT PROPERTY.

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:45.785
POTENTIALLY COULD POSE A RISK.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:46.953
DURING CERTAIN HIGH EVENT

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.255

GOING ON TO PRIVATE LANDOWNERS

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.226
PROPERTY.

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.695
IN CUTTING TREES THAT TO THE

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:56.963
NAKED EYES SEEM TO BE.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.299
WELL OUTSIDE OF THE EASEMENT FOR

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.972
COMES VERY DIFFICULT.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.074
SO THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE HAVING

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.411

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.686
SAY YOU CAN DO BETTER JOB HERE.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.921
THAT TREE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.057
USING THEIR EXPERTISE IS IN THE

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:26.392
BEST INTEREST OF ALL PARTIES

SEVENTEEN OF THOSE FIRES.

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:15.241
CAL FIRE DETERMINED THAT THOSE

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.904
TRUCKS AND NO EMPLOYEES.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.639
WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS.

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.507
THE SHOW UP WITH EMPLOYEES WHO

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.509
THEN BECOME OUR MEMBERS.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:24.911
THEY FIND THEM WHEREVER THEY CAN

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:26.679
FIND THEM HOME DEPOT WHEREVER

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:28.981
THEY CAN.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:29.982
THE FEAR THAT WE HAVE IS THAT

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.417
THE SITUATION HAS BECOME

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:34.220
PARALLEL TO THE SITUATION WITH

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.923
FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS.

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:37.657
WHERE YOU HAVE?

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:40.159
SUBCONTRACTORS TO SUBCONTRACTORS

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.561
TO SUBCONTRACTORS.

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.563
AND THIS WORKFORCE IS NOT BEING

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.597
TRAINED.

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:45.932
THE LEVEL THE NUMBER OF

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:50.269
INCIDENTS OF SERIOUS ACCIDENTS.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.304
THE SHOCKING.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.471
WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE MOST

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:55.241
UPDATED NUMBERS FROM CAL OSHA.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.442
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU FOR THE

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.444
NUMBERS AVAILABLE FROM OCTOBER

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.346
TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE TO

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.748
SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.317
FOURTEEN SO.

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:06.018
FOR LESS THAN TWO YEARS.

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:09.121
THERE WERE SEVENTY FOUR SERIOUS

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:12.191
ACCIDENTS. FIFTY FOUR RESULTING

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.360
IN HOSPITALIZATION.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.062
AND ELEVEN DEATHS.

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:17.563
WE THINK THE NUMBER LEVEL OF

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.032
ACCIDENTS IN JUST THE LAST YEAR.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.667
ARE FAR GREATER THAN THOSE

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:22.501
NUMBERS.

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:23.703
AND THESE ACCIDENTS GO

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.071
UNREPORTED.

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:28.241
BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:29.876
THIS WORKFORCE.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:32.078
EITHER UNDOCUMENTED OR HAVE

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:32.578
FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:34.013
UNDOCUMENTED.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.548
WHEN THEY'RE INJURED?

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:37.149
THEY WALK AWAY THEY DON'T REPORT

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.050
IT.

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:39.619
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.287
CONTRACTORS.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.289
NOT THE PRIME SUBCONTRACTORS BUT

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:46.292
TYPICALLY THE SUBCONTRACTORS AND

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.560
THIRD TIER SUBCONTRACTORS.

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:48.661
THEY'LL HIRE SOMEBODY OFF THE

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.263
STREET TO BE A VEGETATION

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:51.931
MANAGEMENT TECHNICIAN.

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:55.167
WHOSE JOB IS TO CUT BRUSH. TO

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.302
CLEAR BRUSH.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:57.770
BUT WHEN THEY GET HIM BACK INTO

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:59.405
THE WOODS.

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.040
THE HAND OF A CHAIN SAW UNTIL

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:02.708
MISTER CUTTING TREES.

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:04.543
WE HAD A POOR FELLOW JUST ABOUT

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.445
A MONTH AND A HALF AGO. TO PASS

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:07.947
AWAY BECAUSE HE PULLED A TREE ON

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:09.181
HIMSELF BECAUSE HE NOT BEEN

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:12.084
TRAINED ON HOW TO PROPERLY FALL

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:12.985
A TREE.

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.820
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT NEEDS TO

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.088
BE ADDRESSED.

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:19.825
WE PROPOSE IN THIS LEGISLATION.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.627
TO REQUIRE THE UTILITIES. TO

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.529
REQUIRE THAT THEIR

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:24.597
SUBCONTRACTORS.

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:27.400
TRAIN AND CERTIFY ALL OF THESE

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:28.634
WORKERS WITH.

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.504
AT LEAST MINIMUM SAFETY TRAINING.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.838
BEFORE THEY PUT HIM OUT INTO THE

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.675
FIELD AND THAT THE TILITIES

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.210
PROVIDE THE FINANCING. FOR THAT

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:39.445
TRAINING.

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:40.913
MY LAST POINT MISTER CHAIR IS

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.449
WHY THIS IS A VERY COMBUSTIBLE

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:44.984
SITUATION.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.753
IS BECAUSE THE UTILITIES PAY THE

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.155
CONTRACTORS BY THE NUMBER OF

00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:50.489
TREES.

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.658
THE WORKERS ARE PAID A VERY LOW

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.261
VERY LOW HOURLY WAGE THAT IS A

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.496
DANGEROUS COM -- COMBINATION

00:09:57.563 --> 00:09:59.432
BECAUSE HE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:00.533
FOR THAT THIRD TIER

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:02.735
SUBCONTRACTOR HIS DETAILS CREW

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.570

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.938
AS POSSIBLE.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.807
AND THAT IS EIGHT IS

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:11.844
ANTITHETICAL TO SAFETY.

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.080

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:40.553
PROCESS AND ALSO MONITOR THEM.

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:42.821

COME UP WITH THE GRANT PROGRAM

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:32.023
AND WHEN WE WOULD DEFER TO HOW

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.425
THEY MAKE THE DETERMINATION BUT

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.094
THEY WOULD HAVE TO THE CITIES

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.362
WOULD HAVE TO BE WITHIN.

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:40.331
VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:41.966
PRESUMABLY THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:44.068
CITIES IN OUR STATE.

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:46.871

00:31:50.975 --> 00:31:54.479
CURRENT SYSTEMS IS REVERSE.

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:55.113
NINE ONE ONE THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:58.049
CHALLENGES IMPLEMENTING THAT --

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.717
IMPLEMENTING THAT WITH PEOPLE

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.119
WITH CELL PHONES I COULD SEE HOW

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:03.621
THIS MIGHT PLUG THAT GAP.

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:06.124
BUT TEN MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.525

MORE. FIVE HUNDRED CITIES

00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:16.034
POTENTIALLY AT RISK YES I KNOW

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.568
THIS ISN'T THE APPROPRIATIONS

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:18.970
COMMITTEE BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:20.805
FIGURE OUT THE THE THINKING IN

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:23.041
THE MATH OF HOW THIS.

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.677
WOULD GET DEPLOYED YES --

00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:27.612

FORWARD AND I AM NOT -- ADAMANT

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.019
ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THAT SHOULD

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:36.954
WORK IN EXACTLY -- HOW MUCH

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:38.990
SHOULD BE GIVEN TO EACH CITY I'M

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:40.358

HONE IN ON SOME OF THOSE DETAILS

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:46.798
AND CERTAINLY CAL FIRE HAS THE

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:51.002
EXPERTISE AND THEY HAVE THE

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:52.670
KNOWLEDGE AND AND WHERE WITH ALL

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:54.172

WHICH CITIES.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.208
THIS COULD WORK BASS STAND AND

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:59.043
WHICH CITIES ARE LACKING AND AND

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.713
SOME OF THE DIFFERENT TOOLS AND

UTILITY LINES AND POLES.

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:35.800
AS MANY HAVE DONE THE CITY OF

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:36.934
LAGUNA BEACH VISITED PARADISE IN

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:38.769
JANUARY TO SEE WHAT LESSONS WE

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:39.970
CAN LEARN FROM THE DISASTER

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:41.572
THERE AND APPLY THEM TO OUR

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:43.340
COMMUNITY.

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.408
WE LEARNED ABOUT LIKE LAGUNA

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.377
PARADISE SUFFERED FROM LIMITED

00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:47.912
INGRESS AND EGRESS ROUTES AND

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.880
DURING THE CRUCIAL EARLY HOURS

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.182
OF THE FIRE A DOCU ATION ROUTES

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:53.751
WERE BLOCKED BY DOWNED.

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:54.685
POLES IN LINES.

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:56.687
AS ONE OF THE CAL FIRE INCIDENT

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:58.189
COMMANDERS TOLD THE CITY.

00:40:58.255 --> 00:41:00.424
THE DOWNED POWER POLES WERE HUGE

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:01.892
PROBLEM DURING THE EVACUATION

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.260
PROCESS.

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:04.762
SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR WILL CREATE

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:06.130
A MEANS OF CREATING SAFE

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:09.700
EVACUATION ROUTES AND HIGH FIRE

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:10.868
RISK AREAS.

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:11.669
THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:12.236
SEASON WAS THE DEADLIEST AND

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.772
MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASON

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.507
ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA WITH A

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.909

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:20.144
HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN FIRES

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:21.612
WHICH BURN THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.180
ACREAGE RECORDED IN A FIRE

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:24.014
SEASON.

00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:25.616
QUALIFIER HAS DETERMINED THAT AT

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:28.953
LEAST NINETEEN WILD FIRES IN TWO

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:30.020
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO

00:41:30.087 --> 00:41:30.921
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WERE CAUSED BY

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:33.557
UTILITY LINES AND EQUIPMENTS.

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:34.959
THE EASY PUSH BACK ON UNDER

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:36.260
GROUNDING IS THAT IT'S TOO

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:37.261
EXPENSIVE.

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.462
BUT THIS IS A SHORT SIGHTED

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:40.698
ANALYSIS THAT FOCUSES ONLY ON

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:42.666
THE UP FRONT COST WHEN YOU

WASTE CREATED AND THAT

00:41:55.079 --> 00:41:57.181
GREENHOUSE GASES EMITTED FROM

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:58.482
ONE MAJOR WILDFIRE.

00:41:58.549 --> 00:41:59.750
OFFSETS AN ENTIRE YEAR OF

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.418
SAVINGS FROM GREENHOUSE GAS

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:03.654
REDUCTION PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.055
YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THE TRUE

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:08.859
COSTS OF UTILITY BECAUSE

WILDFIRES.

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:10.995
LOCATING THE HAZARDOUS UTILITY

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.263
POLES BELOW GROUND AND TIER

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:12.763
THREE FIRE ZONES WE ARE

INVESTING IN SMART

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.199
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT LOOKS TO THE

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:16.333
FUTURE.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.701
THE FINANCIAL TOLL FOR

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:20.104
HOMEOWNERS RENTERS BUSINESSES

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.805

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:24.441
FIRE SEASONS HAS TOP TEN BILLION

00:42:24.508 --> 00:42:26.277
DOLLARS AND INSURED LOSSES EACH

THE FIRE FIGHTING COSTS OF

HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO SEE

THAT ENCOURAGES A FORM OF

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:03.159

I CARED A SIMILAR BILL.

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.875
WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY --

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:01.377
ALLOWING ATVS ACCESS -- TO

IT'S A STATEWIDE LAW FOR THEM

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:12.589
AND I THINK SEVERAL OTHER --

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.991
STATES COLORADO UTAH.

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.292
THAT SOME OF THEIR MOUNTAIN

00:58:16.359 --> 00:58:17.460
TOWNS.

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.329
RELY ON THIS TYPE OF TOURISM FOR

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:23.066
THEIR ECONOMY -- BUT I WANT TO A

00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:25.335

YOU VERY MUCH.

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.838
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS WE

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:33.142
HAVE AN ON FOR FILLED.

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:34.444
PILOT PROGRAM.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.245
IN THE REASON IT'S BEEN ON FOR

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:36.012
FILLED IS BECAUSE THERE WAS

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:38.081
LITIGATION AND COURT RELATED

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:39.148
ACTION.

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:42.118
THAT CHALLENGE THIS.

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.519
DIRECTLY.

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:46.256
AND SO WHEN WE HEAR FROM -- FROM

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:48.758
FOLKS WHO HAVE STRONG OPINIONS

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:50.960
ON THIS -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.729
THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE PART

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:55.865
OF THE EFFORTS TO NOT HAVE IT

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:57.367
PASSED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:58.568
I'M A I'M STRONGLY OF THE

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:00.403
OPINION THAT IF WE CREATE A

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.638
PILOT PROGRAM.

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.840
IT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:05.608
FRUITION WHAT'S THE POINT OF

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:06.876
STARTING SOMETHING.

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:09.012
IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE -- TO IT

00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:11.648
YIELDS RESULTS IN LEARN FROM

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:12.749
THEM.

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:14.651
SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A IN A

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.386
NEED FOR AN EXTENSION BROUGHT

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:17.887
ABOUT BY DELAYS BY THE VERY

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:19.188
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'VE HEARD

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:20.456
FROM EARLIER.

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.125
NOW LET'S NOT CONFUSE SOME OF

00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:23.593
THE ISSUES -- WITH SOME OF THE

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.295
SENSATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:26.796
DISCUSSIONS THAT OCCUR ELSEWHERE

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:28.898
IN THE STATE IN AT THE NATIONAL

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:32.502
LEVEL. THIRTY NINE OF THE FORTY

00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:34.837
FOUR ROADS ARE PAVED.

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:36.606
THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS IS TO

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:37.974
MAKE CERTAIN.

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:40.176
THAT INDIVIDUALS DO NOT DEGRADE

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:42.278
THE ENVIRONMENT BY GOING OFF

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:43.646
ROAD.

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:45.114
THAT'S THE POINT OF THESE DUAL

00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:48.484
USE -- OPPORTUNITIES SO IF IF

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:50.486
INDIVIDUALS ARE PROPONENTS OF

00:59:50.553 --> 00:59:52.322
THE ENVIRONMENT IT WHICH IS

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:54.457
BAFFLED THE IMAGINATION AT THE

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:56.326
HELLO THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY.

00:59:56.392 --> 00:59:59.629
IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT -- AND

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:02.699
I THINK.

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.701
THE I'D PROBABLY LEAVE OPEN IN

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:06.302
THE COMMENTS FURTHER WITH MY

THIS.

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:21.517
LOOKED UPON IT FROM A PUBLIC

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:24.387
SAFETY STANDPOINT -- IN ADDITION

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.656
TO FIRE SAFETY -- IN I THINK

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.691
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUALS

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.293
IN THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT THAT

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.428
WANT TO DO SOMETHING RESPONSIBLY

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:34.731

BECAUSE NOT NOT.

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:55.752
SO WE WERE REQUIRED -- TO IN

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:56.853

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.079
EXTENSION NECESSARILY WE IT WAS

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.547

THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:08.091
WITH AND ANALYZING FOR THE LAST

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.459
COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT'S WHAT

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.661

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:13.029
TO EXPAND FOR THE NEXT.

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:15.465

WRITTEN DOZEN EGGS EXPAND DOES

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.402
NOT AN ADVANTAGE PROGRAM IT

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.304
EXTENDS THE THE PILOT PERIOD BUT

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:24.006
BUT WITHIN THAT THE THE THE

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:27.176
CONFINES OF THAT -- THAT ADOPTED

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.412
FRAMEWORK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:31.481
OKAY. TWO OTHER COMMENTS

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:33.149
QUESTIONS YES CENTER ON JUST FOR

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:35.051
THE SUPERVISOR WHAT WHAT WAS THE

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:35.618
JUST FOR ME UNDERSTAND LOCAL

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.320
DYNAMICS WAS OF THE VOTE COUNT

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.555
AND THE ON THE BOARD WAS IT.

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:41.290
UNANIMOUS THREE TWO MINUTES AT

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:43.159
UNANIMOUS YOU KNOW IT'S OKAY --

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:43.960
AND THEN I SIDE YOU ARE CHOMPING

01:02:44.026 --> 01:02:45.461
AT THE BIT ON A COUPLE OF THE

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:46.796
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:47.530
YEAH I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:56.739
OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND SOME OF

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:57.373
THE CONCERNS I THINK IT'S BEGIN

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:57.807
THE MIKE.

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.375
A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK BUT I

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.476
KNOW A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS GET

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.979
SEPARATED INTO KIND OF LOOKING

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:03.913
AT A NARAL PART OF IT.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.349
AND WHILE DRIVING ON THE PAVED

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:10.586
ROADS IS GONNA REDUCE DICED.

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:12.288
IT'S GIVING ACT.

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:13.222
THE PEOPLE TO BE IN THE DESERT

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:15.725
WHERE THEY CAN MAKE LOTS OF DUST.

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.326
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LARGER

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:21.430
PICTURE IF -- FIFTEEN NO PATIENT

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:22.165
ACTUALLY OUT THERE SAYING THAT

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.332
THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING

01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:24.700
SO FAR.

01:03:24.767 --> 01:03:25.768
RIGHT IS AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEY

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.103
HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THAT

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.605
IN ANY OF THE VALUATIONS.

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:33.342
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS THE

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:34.477
SECOND EXTENSION. FOR THE SAME

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.979
REASONS.

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:40.750
IT WAS EXTENDED AND THAT.

01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:41.551
TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THIS IS THEIR

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:42.985
ASKING FOR ANOTHER X. WHEN YOU

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:45.188
SAY THE SAME REASONS THAT THEY

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:45.821
GAVE THE REASON THEIR REASON IS

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:48.090
THAT.

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:49.959
AND THEY'RE SAYING IT'S BECAUSE

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.061
IT'S BEEN TIED UP IN LITIGATION.

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:54.797
WITH OVER A TWENTY FIFTEEN STILL

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:55.998
IT'S STILL TOOK A COUPLE OF

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:57.867
YEARS TO GET THE PROGRAM UP AND

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.769
RUNNING HAD -- DESIGNATE THE

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:02.271
ROADS YOU KNOW -- SIGNAGE AND

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.674
ALL OF THAT SO -- IF IT'S TRUE

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.008
THAT THAT WE HAVE HAD IT BUT IT

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.577
IT HAS TAKEN AWHILE TO GET IT

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:09.312
AND WE HAVE ONLY HAD.

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.914
REALLY THREE YEARS OF THE FULL

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:17.720
USE OF IT TO TO EVALUATE.

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:18.888
OKAY MAY MAYBE THERE ISN'T A

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.056
KIND OF FORMAL CONCLUSION TO

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.291
THIS REPORT BUT YOU. THREE FOUR

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:23.626

LIVE OUT THERE I MEAN YOU KNOW

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:26.195
WHETHER IT'S HAPPENING OR NOT

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:26.963
AND I'M.

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:29.565
JUST BECAUSE THE REPORT HASN'T

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:31.934
DOCUMENTED EVERY INCIDENT.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.102
WE HAVE IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:36.239
TRAIL DELIBERATION OR PROBLEMS.

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.607
WE DO MONITOR THAT CLOSELY IN

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:40.176
FACT WE DO IT WITH -- AERIAL MY

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.044
AERIAL UP TIGER FEE AND WE ARE

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:43.713

TRAILS WE ARE GETTING SOME USE

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:48.718
AND THE USE HAS INCREASED.

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:50.086

OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.859
SOME OF THOSE TRAILS ARE NOT AS

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.428
USEFUL OR BEING USED AS MUCH AS

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:02.431
OTHERS BUT THE ONES NEAR BISHOP

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:03.566
ONE LEADS TO A NO IT'S V. AREA

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:05.935
ONE LEADS TO LAWS MUSEUM ONE

CAMPGROUND AND THAT AND THAT

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:15.511
ALLOWS PEOPLE JUST TO PARK AT

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:16.879
THE CAMPGROUND.

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:20.149
IS THAT -- THAT ARE ARE OPEN --

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:21.917
FOR EACH VIEWS ARE STILL OPEN --

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:23.152
FOR EXCUSE IN AREAS THAT AREN'T

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:25.721
ARE NOT PEOPLE CAN ALL THIS DOES

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:26.622
IS CHANGE PEOPLE.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:27.423
PUTTING THEIR IT'S FREE ON A

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.324
TRAILER AND GOING AND PARKING

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.993
SOMEWHERE AND USING THE AREA AS

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.062
OPPOSED TO IN THE OF VERY

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:35.364
LIMITED AREA DRIVING FROM THE

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.800
CAMPGROUND TO THE SAME PLACE.

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:41.570
WHAT WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:42.972
FINAL REPORT?

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.940
FROM COME IN AT NIGHT.

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:45.441
WE WOULD IT.

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:46.409
WOULD THAT I HAVE COMMITTED THAT

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:47.610
I'M NOT GONNA ASK FOR ANOTHER

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.045
EXTENSION FOR THIS PROGRAM WE

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.579
WOULD EITHER ASKED TO IMPLEMENT

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:52.815
IT AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:53.849
BECAUSE WILL NEED.

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:57.086
TO BE WORKING ON IT A YEAR EARLY

01:05:57.153 --> 01:06:01.057
FOR WILL ABANDON THAT'S AND I

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.258
MEAN.

I HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UPSO.

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:05.127
I'LL HAVE TO SEE IF I'M.

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:07.463
STILL SUPERVISOR BUT I I BELIEVE

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.365
THAT THE COUNTY WILL NOT SUPPORT

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:09.865
TRYING TO GO FOR ANOTHER

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:12.435
EXTENSION I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:14.470
THE IDEA WOULD BE TO SEE --

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:15.404
WHERE WE'RE AT THE END OF THE

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:19.175
NEXT IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS FIVE

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.644
YEARS?

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:22.678
GIVE THE KID.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.046
I DON'T KNOW I I I IT'S IT'S

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:28.284
LIKE WE'RE IS A BIT OF YOU KNOW

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:28.884
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES HERE OF

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.019
FOLKS ON THE GROUND SO IT'S A

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:31.687
LITTLE TOUGH TO HAVE A GOOD

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:32.521
SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING I

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.724
GUESS ONE THING AS THE COMMITTEE

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.258
ASKING.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:36.926
FOR A DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:40.529
ANALYSIS -- ON IMPACTS IS AS

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:49.238
PART OF THIS BILL WHAT.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.674
YEAH SO YOU CAN REPORT THAT WE

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:56.679
REQUIRE -- AT THE V&lt;c.cyan&gt;IN THE&lt;/c&gt;

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:57.847
VERY LAST SECTION AND CHEAT.

01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:58.714
G..

01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:00.249
ONE I BELIEVE THAT REPORT ALSO

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:01.684
INCLUDES AN ENVIRONMENTAL

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:03.386
ANALYSIS BUT THAT'S THAT'S A

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.321
THAT'S A WAYS OFF I WOULD JUST

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.522
ASK.

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:07.523
WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR HERE WE

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.258
ARE GOING TO SEE THIS BILL FOR

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:11.961
TODAY THE STATE -- THIS KEEP THE

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:14.163
COMMITTEE APPRISED -- EVEN GOING

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.464
FORWARD IF WE COULD.

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.732
BE LOOKING AT SERVE ON A

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.267
CONTINUOUS BASIS JUST TO MAKE

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:19.802
SURE THERE AREN'T SOME ADVERSE

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.170
CONSEQUENCES THAT WE HAVE AN

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:22.171
ANTICIPATED OR SOME

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.673
PROLIFERATION OF OF OF TRAILS

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.108
THAT ARE THAT ARE HAVING

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:26.976
NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:29.812
ENVIRONMENT -- MICE I MEAN JUST

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.547
TO BE CLEAR THIS IS ABOUT THIS

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:33.449
IS A BILL ABOUT THE USE OF THE

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:34.717
ROADS.

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:37.520
NOT THE ACTUAL -- HV ACCESS TO

BEGIN WITH BUT BUT I THINK THAT --

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:41.657
THAT SENT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.659
SENSITIVE LAND AT THEIR LOOK AT

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:44.393
WHAT IS THE I FORGET IT'S ONE

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.663
POINT LIKE NINETY NINE ALMOST

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.131

MOST MOSTLY PUBLIC IN FACT I

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.703
THINK THE VALUE -- AND

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.806
APPROPRIATELY SEIZED ON I THINK

01:07:56.872 --> 01:07:58.474
MAYBE A WAY FORWARD WE'VE HEARD

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.142
FROM THE SUPERVISOR THAT THERE

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.912
WILL NOT BE -- IN EXTENSION

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:05.314
BEYOND THIS PURSUIT AND I WOULD

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:06.849
SUPPORT THAT WE WE GOT TO SEE

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.651

YEAR MARK -- DO AN INTERMEDIATE

I I I LIKE THE IDEA OKAY BUT ALL

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:41.817

AND THAT WAY WE HAVE EXISTING

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:24.346
CURRICULUM THERE THAT TALKS

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.480
ABOUT FIVE YEARS IT IS CALLED

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:27.916
FIRE TECHNOLOGY IT'S FOCUSED ON

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:29.451
FIRE SUPPRESSION WE HAVE

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.453
FORESTRY THERE THAT.

WHERE THERE'S EXISTING CORPSE

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:58.213
WORK AND SOME OF THAT THAT NEEDS

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:03.885

PRESCRIBED FIRE WHICH IS.

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:07.622
CRITICAL TO RESTORING RESILIENCE

VEGETATION TYPES.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:29.578
THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THE

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:31.513
MONEY IS THE FUNDING THAT'S

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.647
COMING THROUGH THE WHETHER IT'S

TRY TO REGAIN THAT RESILIENCE

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.993
THAT'S BEEN AT RISK AND OUT OF

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.896
WHACK FOR OVER A CENTURY.

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.464
WE NEED AS WE HEARD.

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:51.733
FROM THE GENTLEMAN THAT SPOKE ON

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.468
SENATOR DODD'S BILL.

THE YOU TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM

01:17:54.636 --> 01:17:55.804
THE UTILITY COALITION I COULDN'T

OF DONE A BETTER JOB TALKING

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:00.075
ABOUT HOW.

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:01.810
INAPPROPRIATE IT IS SU HAVE

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:03.745
UNTRAINED PEOPLE WORKING IN

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:05.580
THESE LANDSCAPES AS SAYS IT'S

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.783
NOT WHAT CALIFORNIA DESERVES.

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:09.451
IT'S GOING TO JUST KEEP

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:12.287
INCREASING THE DISASTER MùT

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.021
THAT WERE IN.

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.590
AND SO IT TO HAVE A TWO YEAR

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:16.958
CURRICULUM IS EXTREMELY

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:18.326

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.477
TO TRAIN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:39.247
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:41.349
INDEFENSIBLE SPACE --

WORK.

01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:51.693
SO JUST AT THE FINAL THING I'LL

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.961
SAY IS THAT.

01:18:53.028 --> 01:18:54.596
GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED AN

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:56.698

EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION.

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.773
THAT BASICALLY EXEMPTS

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.675
CALIFORNIA FROM ITS PREMIERE

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:11.413

IF I COULD DEFINE DESPERATE SOME

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:17.786
OTHER WAY I WOULD BET THAT IS

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:19.287
SOUNDING PRETTY DESPERATE TO ME.

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:20.989

CLEAN WATER ACTION FOR THE PAST

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.668
SIXTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN TRYING

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:36.202
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIND SAFE

01:49:36.269 --> 01:49:37.671
DRINKING WATER FOR SMALL

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:38.672
COMMUNITIES.

01:49:38.738 --> 01:49:40.140
I'VE TRACKED IT CLEAN WATER AND

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:41.675
SAFE DRINKING WATER FUNDS I'VE

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:43.977
TRACKED PROP FIFTY EIGHTY FOUR

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:45.345
ONE IN.

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:47.714
SIXTY EIGHT AND I DO WE'VE DONE

01:49:47.781 --> 01:49:48.815
A LOT WE'VE ACTUALLY.

01:49:48.882 --> 01:49:50.984
YEAH YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO PAY

01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:52.752
BACK A PLANNING LOAN IF YOU'RE

01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:54.154
LOW INCOME COMMUNITY I MEAN IT

01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:54.955
USED TO BE REALLY BAD.

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:57.190
BUT YOU SEE WE STILL HAVE THESE

01:49:57.257 --> 01:49:59.893
PROBLEMS THAT SEEM INSOLVABLE SO

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.461
EMERGENCY FUNDING YEAH HE'S

01:50:01.528 --> 01:50:03.363
PORTERFIELD WAS LUCKY BECAUSE WE

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:04.798
HAD A DROUGHT AND SO THE OFFICE

01:50:04.864 --> 01:50:06.533
OF EMERGENCY SERVICES.

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:08.068
WAS ABLE TO COME IN AND PROVIDE

01:50:08.134 --> 01:50:09.669
INTERIM DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:11.504
TO THAT COMMUNITY WHEN THEY RAN

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:13.406
OUT OF WATER -- LONG TERM

01:50:13.473 --> 01:50:14.975
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SO

01:50:15.041 --> 01:50:17.210
OFTEN WE GET FUNDING TO SOLVE A

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.678
COMMUNITY PROBLEM WITHIN THEIR

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:19.879
WATER BILLS AND THAT BEING

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:21.181
BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND HUNDRED

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:22.048
AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:23.616
WHICH A COMMUNITY WITH AN INCOME

01:50:23.683 --> 01:50:29.155
OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:31.424
CAN'T AFFORD AND THEN.

01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:32.926
THE OTHER IDEA IS HOW DO WE TAKE

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:33.593
CARE PEOPLE ARE SERVED BY PUBLIC

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.627
WATER SYSTEM THAT'S BETWEEN A

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:35.261
MILLION AND A HALF IN TOO MANY

01:50:35.328 --> 01:50:37.030
CALIFORNIANS WE DON'T EVEN COUNT

01:50:37.097 --> 01:50:38.198
THEM AND WE HAVE HOPE

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.466
COMMUNITIES.

01:50:39.532 --> 01:50:40.800
IN THE CHOI LIKE BASS AND THEY

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:42.335
DID A SURVEY.

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:44.637
ALMOST 30% OF THE HOME CLUSTERS

01:50:44.704 --> 01:50:46.406
THEY FOUND THEIR OF AT LEAST

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:48.108
FIFTEEN HOMES THE DEFINITION OF

01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:49.142
A PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM.

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:50.577
BUT THEY WERE SERVED BY PUBLIC

01:50:50.643 --> 01:50:52.078
WATER SYSTEMS YET CAN TO

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:53.713
COMMUNITY SIDE BY SIDE ONE

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:55.148
QUALIFIES FOR ASSISTANCE AND THE

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:56.549
OTHER DOESN'T EVEN THOUGH THEY

01:50:56.616 --> 01:50:59.586
HAVE SIMILAR WATER NEEDS.

01:50:59.652 --> 01:51:00.854
SO THE THIS.

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.756
THAT PROGRAM DEVELOPED --

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.190
OUTLINED IN SB TWO HUNDRED

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:06.059
REALLY IS LOOKING TO SOLVE THOSE

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:07.761
PROBLEMS AS THEY COME UP AND

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:09.362
PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY SO WE

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:10.997
CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:12.532
KNOW ABOUT TODAY THE ONES THAT

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:13.900
ARE GOING TO COME UP TOMORROW

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:14.834
BECAUSE THOSE.

01:51:14.901 --> 01:51:16.669
THOSE PROBLEMS CHANGE ALL THE

01:51:16.736 --> 01:51:18.238
TIME SO THERE'S ABOUT THREE

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:19.606
HUNDRED PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS OUT

01:51:19.672 --> 01:51:20.507
OF COMPLIANCE RIGHT NOW WELL

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:25.612
THERE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:51:25.678 --> 01:51:26.179
PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IN THE

01:51:26.246 --> 01:51:27.480
STATE. TWENTY NINE HUNDRED OF

01:51:27.547 --> 01:51:28.081
THEM A COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS

01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:29.382
THAT SERVE DRINKING WATER TO

01:51:29.449 --> 01:51:30.784
RESIDENTS AND SO.

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.118
WE THINK THREE HUNDRED TWENTY IS

01:51:32.185 --> 01:51:32.619
A LOT BUT THERE'S A BIG

01:51:32.685 --> 01:51:34.621
RESERVOIR SYSTEMS OUT THERE THAT

01:51:34.687 --> 01:51:37.023
WE NEED TO LOOK AT UNDERSTAND

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:39.426
EVALUATE AND TRY TO FIX IF

01:51:39.492 --> 01:51:40.093
NEEDED.

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.227
AND SO WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:42.462
LOOKING.

01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:43.129

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.403
DOES THAT IT REQUIRES AT

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:10.129
MY CONSTITUENTS WANT ME TO

02:01:10.196 --> 02:01:12.231
OPPOSE THE BILL I'M JUST GONNA

02:01:12.298 --> 02:01:13.366

ACCEPTABLE.

02:01:18.804 --> 02:01:19.672
SHE THAT AGAIN.

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:21.774

TO COMMITTEE CONSULTANT.

02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:41.360
I THINK IT'S SAME INTENT.

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:43.462
LOT OF THE SAME MECHANICS BUT

02:01:43.529 --> 02:01:44.563
JUST IT IT IT IT.

02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:47.633
READS CLEAR I THINK YEAH I I

I DID WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE SO I

02:01:52.471 --> 02:01:54.907
I KNOW WE DIDN'T DRILL DOWN.

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:57.176
DEEPLY ON SOME OF THESE -- THESE

02:01:57.243 --> 02:01:58.544
ADDITIONAL ATTENTION ISSUES BUT

02:01:58.611 --> 02:01:59.612
AND I AND I KNOW WORK IN

02:01:59.679 --> 02:02:01.380
PROGRESS BUT CAN YOU KIND OF

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:03.249
UPDATE US OR IN IN TERMS OF YOUR

02:02:03.315 --> 02:02:04.316
THINKING.

02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:07.920
I'LL JUST FLAG A FEW BUT THE THE

02:02:07.987 --> 02:02:09.121
REGIONAL EQUITY QUESTION.

02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:10.656
SERVICE HAS THINKING O ALL OF

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:12.324
THEIR THERE'S A MENTION ABOUT

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:13.893
THESE COMPLIANT BUT REALLY

02:02:13.959 --> 02:02:15.394
EXPENSIVE SYSTEMS TRYING TO

02:02:15.461 --> 02:02:17.029
THINK UP A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT

02:02:17.096 --> 02:02:17.830
AND THEN THIS.

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.165
THIS -- THERE THERE'S A FEW

02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:21.400
OTHERS BUT LOW INCOME WATER

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:26.238
USERS.

02:02:26.305 --> 02:02:27.907
I I'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH HOW.

02:02:27.973 --> 02:02:29.308
TO TRY TO TACKLE THE THE RATE

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:31.010
SIDE OF THINGS -- AND WHAT WHERE

02:02:31.077 --> 02:02:32.678
THEY FIT SO YESTERDAY SO LET ME

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:33.446
TAKE A PERSON BACK AND THEN

02:02:33.512 --> 02:02:34.346
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO INVITE OUR

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:35.915
WITNESSES IF THEY WANT TO WEIGH

02:02:35.981 --> 02:02:38.150
IN ON IT -- AND I DO APPRECIATE.

02:02:38.217 --> 02:02:39.819
YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL

02:02:39.885 --> 02:02:42.588
HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.690
SO THE GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY -- WE

02:02:44.757 --> 02:02:46.726
THINK IS BUILT IN BECAUSE THE

02:02:46.792 --> 02:02:48.794
PRIVATIZATION OF DISADVANTAGED

02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:49.762
COMMUNITIES AND YOU'RE GONNA

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:52.498
FIND THOSE FROM THE OREGON

02:02:52.565 --> 02:02:53.933
BORDER TO THE MEXICO BORDER.

02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:55.434
YOU SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS IS

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:57.203
JUST A CENTRAL VALLEY PROBLEM

02:02:57.269 --> 02:02:59.438
IT'S NOT THE COMMON DENOMINATOR

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:01.207
OF THESE THREE HUNDRED PLUS

02:03:01.273 --> 02:03:02.274
WATER SYSTEMS.

02:03:02.341 --> 02:03:06.245
IS BY DEFINITION.

02:03:06.312 --> 02:03:07.146
THEY ARE DISADVANTAGED

02:03:07.213 --> 02:03:09.148
COMMUNITIES THE INCOME ISN'T

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:12.718
ENOUGH. TO REMEDIATE OR PROVIDE

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:13.953
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE.

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:16.021
BASED ON THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR

02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:17.523
WATER RATES SO.

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:19.058
YOU COULD PUT WATER RATES UP TO

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:21.360
A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH

02:03:21.427 --> 02:03:21.961
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A

02:03:22.027 --> 02:03:23.596
MONTH IN THOSE WATER BILLS

02:03:23.662 --> 02:03:24.964
WOULDN'T GET PAID.

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:26.766
AND THOSE REPAIRS WOULD BE IN

02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:29.135
DEFAULT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:33.239
FALL CALIFORNIANS JOIN HANDS.

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:35.574
PITCH IN A DE MINIMUS AMOUNT.

02:03:35.641 --> 02:03:37.910
WE CAN ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.

02:03:37.977 --> 02:03:39.879
PRIORITIZING DISADVANTAGED

02:03:39.945 --> 02:03:41.747
COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED IN THE

02:03:41.814 --> 02:03:45.251
BILL -- IN IS UNDERSTOOD.

02:03:45.317 --> 02:03:47.153
BY THE WILL OF THE WATER BOARD --

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:49.455
SO THE GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IS

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:51.423
GOING TO BE ROUTED IN THE

02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:53.793
ECONOMIC EQUITY AND I THINK

02:03:53.859 --> 02:03:55.961
YOU'LL FIND WELL WON'T BE.

02:03:56.028 --> 02:03:57.897
IDENTICAL DISTRIBUTION AROUND

02:03:57.963 --> 02:03:59.431
THE STATE IT WILL BE

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:01.600
DISTRIBUTION AROUND THE STATE OF

02:04:01.667 --> 02:04:03.068
CALIFORNIA.

02:04:03.135 --> 02:04:06.505
LOW INCOME WATER USERS -- WE

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:07.406
EXEMPTS THEM.

02:04:07.473 --> 02:04:08.707
GETTING INTO OUR FUNDING

02:04:08.774 --> 02:04:10.743
MECHANISM THAT'S NOT BEFORE YOU

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:12.278
TODAY BUT JUST HOW WE TRY.

02:04:12.344 --> 02:04:14.914
TO BRING SOCIAL EQUITY IN

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:16.115
ECONOMIC EQUITY.

02:04:16.182 --> 02:04:18.951
OUR PRIOR VERSIONS HAVE PROVIDED

02:04:19.018 --> 02:04:21.086
AN EXEMPTION FOR RATE EARS UP

02:04:21.153 --> 02:04:24.023
22100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

02:04:24.089 --> 02:04:30.262
LINE -- COST STOPS THERE -- WE

02:04:30.329 --> 02:04:32.031
IN THE FUND IT ALLOWS OBVIOUSLY

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:32.932
FOR STATE FUNDING FOR FEDERAL

02:04:32.998 --> 02:04:33.999
FUNDING IT COULD IT COULD

02:04:34.066 --> 02:04:34.900
ATTRACT NONPROFIT --

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:36.268
CONTRIBUTIONS PHILANTHROPIC

02:04:36.335 --> 02:04:38.904
CONTRIBUTIONS WE WANT TO CREATE

02:04:38.971 --> 02:04:39.605
A CATCH ALL.

02:04:39.672 --> 02:04:41.707
THEN THE DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:44.410
IS DEMOCRATIC HAS OVERSIGHT.

02:04:44.476 --> 02:04:46.512
AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT WE

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:47.947
GO FOR WHAT WE CALL THE LOW

02:04:48.013 --> 02:04:49.615
HANGING FRUIT FIRST WE THINK

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:53.118
WITH EARLY INVESTMENT IN.

02:04:53.185 --> 02:04:53.786
CONNECTING SOME SYSTEMS THAT ARE

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:55.988
CLOSE TO A CLEAN WATER SYSTEM

02:04:56.055 --> 02:04:57.122
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST

02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:59.091
INVESTMENT OF THOSE DOLLARS AND

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:01.760
THE QUICKEST REMEDY FOR THOSE

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:02.461
WITHOUT CLEAN SAFE DRINKING

02:05:02.528 --> 02:05:03.195
WATER.

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:05.364
AS YOU GO UP THE LADDER YOU'RE

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:06.398
GOING TO HAVE SOME MORE THE

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:07.666
INNER CORE MORE CAPITAL

02:05:07.733 --> 02:05:08.801
INVESTMENT.

02:05:08.868 --> 02:05:10.336
SOME OF THE OPPOSITION SAYS WHY

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:12.004
SHOULD THIS FUND TO BE USED FOR

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:13.439
CAPITAL INVESTMENT.

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:15.140
THIS FUND WE WANTED TO BE USED

02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:16.775
TO GET PEOPLE CLEAN SAFE

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:19.178
DRINKING WATER THE BIG GAP HAS

02:05:19.245 --> 02:05:20.512
BEEN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE.

02:05:20.579 --> 02:05:22.281
BUT IN ONE COMMUNITY THERE MIGHT

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:24.550
BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION MIGHT

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:26.118
INCLUDE SOME CAPITAL INVESTMENT

02:05:26.185 --> 02:05:27.653
OUR BILL DOESN'T PRECLUDE THAT

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.822
BUT LET ME SEE IF MS CURRIE

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:34.159
WANTS TO ADD TO ANY OF THAT --

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:36.462
WARMEST ROMERO FROM.

02:05:36.528 --> 02:05:37.463
CO CV THANKS I JUST WANTED TO

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:38.063
KNOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:39.765
EXPENSIVE SYSTEMS HERE TALK

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:41.033
ABOUT WATER SYSTEMS.

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.434
HAVING A LARGE EXPENSE IN

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:44.403
DELIVERING WATER AND TYPICALLY

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:45.771
WHAT WE WOULD THINK IS THAT THE

02:05:45.838 --> 02:05:46.839
WATER BOARD USUALLY GIVES OUT

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:49.241
CONTRACTS TO ENGINEERS IN THIS

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:51.010
CASE OPERATORS TO DO THAT RATHER

02:05:51.076 --> 02:05:52.578
THAN THE WATER SYSTEM DIRECTLY

02:05:52.645 --> 02:05:53.979
PAYING FOR IT.

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:55.948
YOU ALSO AT THE ANNOUNCES ALSO

02:05:56.015 --> 02:05:57.182
ASKED ABOUT LOW INCOME RATE

02:05:57.249 --> 02:05:58.284
PAYERS WHICH ARE FOUND

02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:00.219
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THE

02:06:00.286 --> 02:06:02.521
STATE BOARD UNDER LEGISLATION

02:06:02.588 --> 02:06:04.757
AUTHORED BY SET BY THEN ASSEMBLY

02:06:04.823 --> 02:06:09.461
MEMBER DODD -- IN WHAT WAS THAT --

02:06:09.528 --> 02:06:10.095
TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN REQUIRES

02:06:10.162 --> 02:06:11.463
THE STATE TO DEVELOP A LOW

02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:14.166
INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

02:06:14.233 --> 02:06:16.068
SIMILAR TO WHAT ENERGY CUSTOMERS

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:18.070
ALREADY HAVE AND THAT WOULD COST

02:06:18.137 --> 02:06:19.772
BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN HUNDRED

02:06:19.838 --> 02:06:21.373
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THE

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.208
ESTIMATE SO -- WE'RE HAVING A

02:06:23.275 --> 02:06:24.677
REALLY HARD TIME GETTING THIS

02:06:24.743 --> 02:06:25.911
AMOUNT SO I THINK WE WANT A

02:06:25.978 --> 02:06:28.047
LITTLE EXTRA TIME AND THOUGHT

02:06:28.113 --> 02:06:29.748
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIND.

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:31.283
THE INDIVIDUAL RATE ASSISTANCE

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:35.854
PROGRAM THAT'S CONTINUES TO BE

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:38.724
RESEARCHED [inaudible]

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:40.893
MY MY MY INTEREST IN THAT LOW

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:42.962
INCOME RATE ISSUE IS.

02:06:43.028 --> 02:06:44.897
BABY SOMEONE ABOUT THE STATE

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.398
WATER BOARD ACTION PENDING BUT

02:06:46.465 --> 02:06:48.634
ALSO DEPENDING ON THE FUNDING

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:51.904
MECHANISM AND HOW THE FINAL VOTE.

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:54.406
IS ASSESSED TRYING TO MAXIMIZE

02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:56.175
THE ABILITY EMPOWER SOME THESE

02:06:56.241 --> 02:06:59.144
LOCAL WATER AGENCIES TO SOLVE.

02:06:59.211 --> 02:07:00.679
EQUITY CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:02.414
GOT THAT WON'T NECESSARILY ADD

02:07:02.481 --> 02:07:03.983
COSTS TO THE LEGISLATION OR

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:05.884
REQUIRE AN APPROPRIATION OR EVEN

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:07.753
A STATE FEE BUT TRYING.

02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:09.088
TO FIND DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:10.723
BROADER RATE PRESSURE ISSUE THAT

02:07:10.789 --> 02:07:12.725
WE HEAR FROM MACH ONE SOME OF

02:07:12.791 --> 02:07:14.259
THE AGENCIES AND SO.

02:07:14.326 --> 02:07:16.161
WE WE CAN KEEP SORT OF THAT KEEP

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:18.564
THAT ONE ON SIMMER AND AND AND

02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:20.766
SEE OF THIS THING INVOLVES BUT I

02:07:20.833 --> 02:07:24.870
I'M I'M I'M C&lt;c.cyan&gt; INTERESTED IN&lt;/c&gt;

02:07:24.937 --> 02:07:26.939
THAT AND THEN.

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:28.974
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE ON THIS LOW

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:31.276
HANGING FRUIT A HOW DO WE SCOPE

02:07:31.343 --> 02:07:31.877
THAT THEN THE SENATOR PUT IT

02:07:31.944 --> 02:07:33.212
WELL BUT LIKE MORE GRANULARITY

02:07:33.278 --> 02:07:33.979
ABOUT.

02:07:34.046 --> 02:07:35.881
WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WHAT WHAT WE

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:37.449
COULD ANTICIPATE COMING WITH A

02:07:37.516 --> 02:07:38.851
MECHANISM WE'VE GOT IN PLACE

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:40.052
HERE LIKE WHAT WHAT COULD WE SEE

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:41.120
IN THE FIRST?

02:07:41.186 --> 02:07:42.755
COUPLE YEARS THE PROGRAM WHERE

02:07:42.821 --> 02:07:44.356
ARE THE SUPER HIGH PRIORITIES

02:07:44.423 --> 02:07:46.258
OUT THERE WHAT WHAT WHAT DOES

02:07:46.325 --> 02:07:48.293
KIND OF EMERGES THE AS HE SAID

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.228
THE LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR NOW I

02:07:49.294 --> 02:07:50.629
THINK YOU LOOK AT PLACES WHERE

02:07:50.696 --> 02:07:52.431
YOU ALREADY HAVE INFORMATION SO

02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:53.432
TWO THINGS ONE IS YOU START

02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:55.067
GATHERING INFORMATION FOR

02:07:55.134 --> 02:07:55.334
INSTANCE.

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:56.535
ON PRIVATE WELLS SO YOU CAN

02:07:56.602 --> 02:07:58.837
UNDERSTAND AREAS THAT MIGHT NEED

02:07:58.904 --> 02:08:00.072
A WARNING.

02:08:00.139 --> 02:08:02.508
LETTER TO GO OUT NEXT YOU WANT

02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:04.009
TO LOOK AT WHAT THE SENATOR

02:08:04.076 --> 02:08:05.677
REFER TO WHICH IS CONSOLIDATION.

02:08:05.744 --> 02:08:07.679
AND THERE ARE IF YOU THINK ABOUT

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:09.081
THE WAY CALIFORNIA GROWS IT'S

02:08:09.148 --> 02:08:10.916
GROWN AROUND THE SMALL

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:12.451
COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES SO THERE

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:13.652
ARE SOME CITIES.

02:08:13.719 --> 02:08:15.320
THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY A SMALL

02:08:15.387 --> 02:08:17.623
WATER SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE

02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:19.391
AND THOSE COULD BE EASILY HOOKED

02:08:19.458 --> 02:08:20.225
UP SOME.

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:24.663
AS SIMPLE AS JUST TURNING AT

02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:27.032
PIPE THE TURNING ON A THINK IT

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:28.233
AND OTHERS A SMALL PIPE OTHERS

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:29.935
IT'S A LTTLE MORE EXPENSIVE YOU

02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:31.136
HAVE.

02:08:31.203 --> 02:08:32.871
TO BUILD A LONGER PIPELINE.

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:35.040
BUT I THINK THAT IDEAS SOME OF

02:08:35.107 --> 02:08:37.209
THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS WHERE

02:08:37.276 --> 02:08:39.178
IT'S POSSIBLE INAPPROPRIATE

02:08:39.244 --> 02:08:40.479
SHOULD PROBABLY NO LONGER EXIST

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:42.381
AND THE STATE BOARD THE

02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:44.850
LEGISLATURE GAVE YOU GAVE THEM.

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:46.618
THE AUTHORITY TO MANDATE

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:48.554
CONSOLIDATION AND EVEN THOUGH

02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:50.189
THEY'VE ONLY MANDATED A HANDFUL

02:08:50.255 --> 02:08:52.057
OF CONSOLIDATIONS THAT THREAT

02:08:52.124 --> 02:08:53.425
HAS LED TO A HUNDRED

02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:54.993
CONSOLIDATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO

02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:56.161
YEARS.

02:08:56.228 --> 02:08:57.796
SO IT IS HAPPENING NOW AND

02:08:57.863 --> 02:09:00.232
HAVING MORE MONEY TO HELP PAY

02:09:00.299 --> 02:09:01.834
FOR THE COST OF CONNECTION WILL

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:05.537
HELP SPUR MORE I THINK OVER THE

02:09:05.604 --> 02:09:07.439
NEXT FEW YEARS.

02:09:07.506 --> 02:09:09.108
AND WHILE I'VE GOT YOU HERE

02:09:09.174 --> 02:09:10.943
THOUGHTS ON THE THE COMMENTS AND

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:12.945
ADDITIONAL LONG TERM SOLUTIONS

02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:14.746
OPEN THIS THERE AND THEN ON THE

02:09:14.813 --> 02:09:16.215
NONPROFIT DEFINITION.

02:09:16.281 --> 02:09:18.250
I I DON'T NEED TO HOLD YOU TO IT

02:09:18.317 --> 02:09:19.885
TODAY I JUST WANT TO GET SOME

02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:21.120
FEEDBACK ON THE RECORD LOW WE

02:09:21.186 --> 02:09:22.788
GOT WHAT WE GOT SOME EXPERTS IN

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:23.789
THERE SO WHAT WAS THE FIRST

02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:25.157
QUESTION SIR -- FIRST ON THE

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:28.127
SORT OF LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AND

02:09:28.193 --> 02:09:29.394
THE SCOPE OF WHAT.

02:09:29.461 --> 02:09:30.596
YOU ARE THINK OUGHT TO BE

02:09:30.662 --> 02:09:32.030
ELIGIBLE IN IN THERE.

02:09:32.097 --> 02:09:33.699
I THINK IT'S ALL DRINKING WATER

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:35.734
A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES IN IN

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:37.369
THIS ELECTION ON LONG TERM

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:39.471
DRINKING WATER SOLUTIONS BUT THE

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:40.706
ANALYSIS MENTIONS.

02:09:40.772 --> 02:09:42.174
WASTE WATER TREATMENT OTHERS OR

02:09:42.241 --> 02:09:43.775
TO IMPACTS.

02:09:43.842 --> 02:09:44.910
I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF

02:09:44.977 --> 02:09:47.012
HOW I THINK I THINK WHAT WE WANT

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:48.480
IS TO BE EXPANSIVE AND FLEXIBLE

02:09:48.547 --> 02:09:49.548
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:50.649
GOING TO HAPPEN AND IT'S TRUE

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:52.885
THAT -- FAILING WASTE WATER AND

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:54.720
SEPTIC SYSTEMS DO CONTAMINATE

02:09:54.786 --> 02:09:56.855
WATER SUPPLIES IN SOME AREAS SO

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:59.324
THAT COULD BE SOMETHING I THINK

02:09:59.391 --> 02:10:00.759
THAT IT'S ALREADY PERMITTED BUT

02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:02.194

02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:30.896
ECONOMY TO A FOSSIL FREE.

02:14:30.962 --> 02:14:33.198
BASED ECONOMY IN A MATTER OF

02:14:33.265 --> 02:14:34.433
MERE DECADES.

02:14:34.499 --> 02:14:35.901
AND IT BEARS REPEATING THIS

02:14:35.967 --> 02:14:39.671
PROBLEM IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL.

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:40.939
WITH HAVING TO ASSUME THE

02:14:41.006 --> 02:14:43.475
LIABILITY OF JUST TWO PIECES OF

02:14:43.542 --> 02:14:45.310
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:14:45.377 --> 02:14:46.812
BOTH IN MY DISTRICT.

02:14:46.878 --> 02:14:49.314
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:51.349
ALREADY ON THE HOOK TODAY. FOR

02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:56.121
OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:57.989
AND IS LIKELY ON THE HOOK FOR

02:14:58.056 --> 02:15:00.792
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MORE.

02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:02.794
BY THE TIME THE DECOMMISSIONING

02:15:02.861 --> 02:15:05.030
OF THESE TWO PROJECTS ONE IS

02:15:05.096 --> 02:15:06.498
PLATFORM HOLLY.

02:15:06.565 --> 02:15:07.866
IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL OFF

02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:09.267
OF KALITA.

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:10.902
AND THE OTHER IS ON RING CONN

02:15:10.969 --> 02:15:14.039
ISLAND A MAN MADE ISLAND -- THAT

02:15:14.105 --> 02:15:19.044
IS -- IN VENTURA COUNTY.

02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:21.112
THESE PRODUCT THESE BOTH THESE

02:15:21.179 --> 02:15:23.114
ITEMS BOTH THESE.

02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:25.517
HUGE INFRASTRUCTURES HAVE

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:27.319
DECLARED BANKRUPTCY.

02:15:27.385 --> 02:15:28.620
AND THE STATE HAS BEEN HANDED

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:30.322
BACK THE DEED AND THE

02:15:30.388 --> 02:15:32.090
LIABILITIES FOR CLEANING UP THE

02:15:32.157 --> 02:15:33.558
MESS THAT THESE OIL COMPANIES

02:15:33.625 --> 02:15:35.427
HAVE MADE OVER THE COURSE OF

02:15:35.494 --> 02:15:36.094
TIME.

02:15:36.161 --> 02:15:37.729
FROM WHICH THEY HAVE RECEIVED

02:15:37.796 --> 02:15:39.364
PROFIT IN THE BILLIONS OF

02:15:39.431 --> 02:15:42.133
DOLLARS BUT I'VE LITERALLY.

02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:44.703
NOW HELD AND PUT THE TAXPAYERS

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:48.640
OF CALIFORNIA RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:15:48.707 --> 02:15:50.609
CLEANING UP THEIR MESS.

02:15:50.675 --> 02:15:52.344
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS FRUSTRATING.

02:15:52.410 --> 02:15:54.179
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

02:15:54.246 --> 02:15:56.181
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

02:15:56.248 --> 02:15:57.849
NOW GRANTED NOT EVERY PIECE OF

02:15:57.916 --> 02:15:59.551
OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IS A

02:15:59.618 --> 02:16:01.720
LARGE OFFSHORE FACILITY.

02:16:01.786 --> 02:16:03.722
BUT WITH THE TENS OF THOUSANDS

02:16:03.788 --> 02:16:05.557
OF INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE

02:16:05.624 --> 02:16:07.225
STATE IN THE COST SALINAS

02:16:07.292 --> 02:16:09.427
INVOLVED WITH REMOVING

02:16:09.494 --> 02:16:11.396
INDUSTRIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S

02:16:11.463 --> 02:16:12.797
NOT HARD TO IMAGINE.

02:16:12.864 --> 02:16:14.633
THE SIZEABLE LIABILITIES THAT WE

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:16.501
WILL BE FACING IN THE COMING

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.270
DECADES.

02:16:18.336 --> 02:16:19.771
BUT I DON'T WANT US TO JUST HAVE

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:21.773
TO IMAGINE THOSE ON PLAN

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.775
LIABILITIES AND BEYOND READY FOR

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:26.011
THEM.-WHEN THEY UNEXPECTEDLY HIT OUR

02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:28.647
GENERAL FUND LIKE A MACK TRUCK?

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:31.349
WHAT I INSTEAD ASK IS I BELIEVE

02:16:31.416 --> 02:16:32.784
EMINENTLY REASONABLE?

02:16:32.851 --> 02:16:34.953
IT IS FOR OUR PRIMARY REGULATOR

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:37.022
OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN THE

02:16:37.088 --> 02:16:39.758
STATE. TO DEVELOP A FUNCTIONAL

02:16:39.824 --> 02:16:42.961
MECHANISM. TO ASSESS.

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:44.729
THESE EXPECTED COSTS SO THAT IT

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:46.464
CAN BEGIN TO COMPREHENSIVELY

02:16:46.531 --> 02:16:48.300
MAKE ASSESSMENTS THE GUIDE THE

02:16:48.366 --> 02:16:50.502
LEGISLATURE TO BETTER

02:16:50.569 --> 02:16:54.706
FINANCIALLY PLAN AND PREPARE.

02:16:54.773 --> 02:16:55.440
THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES.

02:16:55.507 --> 02:16:57.042
AND I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:58.476
THE STRIDES TO DARKER HAS MADE

02:16:58.543 --> 02:17:00.979
OVER THE YEARS THE RECENT YEARS.

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:03.114
IN ISSUING MORE COMPLETE PERMITS

02:17:03.181 --> 02:17:04.149
THAT ACCOUNT FOR TAIL AND

02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:06.284
LIABILITIES IN REQUIRING

02:17:06.351 --> 02:17:08.086
OPERATORS TO BONTA LIMITS

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:09.921
ALLOWED BY STATE LAW AND IN

02:17:09.988 --> 02:17:12.157
ADVOCATING FOR AND ADMINISTERING

02:17:12.223 --> 02:17:13.959
STATE FUNDS TO DEAL WITH LONG

02:17:14.025 --> 02:17:15.160
TERM PROBLEMS.

02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:17.195
LIKE ABANDONED AND HAZARDOUS

02:17:17.262 --> 02:17:19.331
WELLS AS WAS SEEN IN THE

02:17:19.397 --> 02:17:20.832
LEGISLATION.

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:22.133
THAT WE DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:23.902
THAT IS NOW PROVIDING SOME

02:17:23.969 --> 02:17:26.638
RESOURCES TO REMEDIATE INTO CAP

02:17:26.705 --> 02:17:28.873
ABANDONED WELL SPECIFICALLY.

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:30.775
THE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:33.111
EIGHT OF THEM THAT CONTINUE TO

02:17:33.178 --> 02:17:35.614
LEGAL OIL IN MY DISTRICT.

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:37.682
BUT THESE ARE STEPS IN THE RIGHT

02:17:37.749 --> 02:17:39.050
DIRECTION BUT THEY ARE SMALL

02:17:39.117 --> 02:17:41.653
STEPS PARTICULARLY GIVEN.

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:44.122
THE FOOT RACE WE ARE IN TO TRY

02:17:44.189 --> 02:17:45.757
TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS.

02:17:45.824 --> 02:17:48.059
THE FUTURE CLEANUP COST THE

02:17:48.126 --> 02:17:50.395
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS LIKELY TO

02:17:50.462 --> 02:17:54.466
BE REQUIRED OR AT LEAST ASKED TO

02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:56.701
SO.

02:17:56.768 --> 02:17:57.469
THE BILL MAY SEEM SMALL INTEREST

02:17:57.535 --> 02:17:59.170
SET UP THAT INITIAL -- STRUCTURE

02:17:59.237 --> 02:18:00.505
BUT IT LAYS AN IMPORTANT

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:01.606
FOUNDATION TO DEALING

02:18:01.673 --> 02:18:04.075
RESPONSIBLY AND PROACTIVELY

02:18:04.142 --> 02:18:05.910

TRUE COST OF SHUTTING THESE

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:21.292
THINGS DOWN.

02:18:21.359 --> 02:18:23.228
WHEN WE ORIGINALLY BONDED THESE

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:25.997
LEASES AND AS A CONSEQUENCE

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:30.068
THESE COSTS ARE ASTRONOMICAL?

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:32.537
THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:34.973

THESE COMPANIES -- BUT AS YOU

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:26.451
CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT'LL BE A

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:28.419
PRETTY TALL ORDER -- FOR THEM TO

02:20:28.486 --> 02:20:29.053
TO SEE A PENNY COMING BACK TO

02:20:46.237 --> 02:20:47.338
LEAVING SOMEONE ELSE IN THIS

02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:48.473
CASE THE STATE TO CLEAN UP AFTER

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE

02:29:42.173 --> 02:29:44.342
EXISTING FINANCIAL ASSURANCES --

02:29:44.408 --> 02:29:46.677
BOTH HELD BY THE STATE AND IN

02:29:46.744 --> 02:29:49.747
PRIVATE HANDS -- SOME OF THE THE

02:29:49.814 --> 02:29:50.881
PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED

02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:52.149

02:29:52.216 --> 02:29:54.985
SEVERAL YEARS -- AS A COMMITTEE

02:29:55.052 --> 02:29:56.554
ANNOUNCES NOTES THERE'S BEEN.

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.422

WE UNDERSTAND -- I THINK THE THE

02:30:15.373 --> 02:30:17.007

WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT --

02:30:20.611 --> 02:30:22.713
THE STATE BUDGET HAD TO JUMP IN

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:23.881
LAST YEAR.

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:25.082

THE PANIC OF SITUATION AND

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:38.963
OTHERS -- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO

02:34:17.815 --> 02:34:19.216
IS THE DELAY IN HOPE THAT A BILL

02:34:19.283 --> 02:34:20.651
CAN'T GET OUT OF COMMITTEE AND

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:21.986
THEN IT'S DEAD FOR THE YEAR SO.

02:34:22.052 --> 02:34:24.655
MOVING THE BILL WILL ALLOW US TO

02:34:24.722 --> 02:34:25.689
CONTINUE.

02:34:25.756 --> 02:34:26.790
IN THE PROCESS WE GOT SOME GOOD

02:34:26.857 --> 02:34:29.259
SUGGESTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN

02:34:29.326 --> 02:34:30.894
THE ANALYSIS WE ARE.

02:34:30.961 --> 02:34:33.998
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH DR --

02:34:34.064 --> 02:34:36.266
AND TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC

02:34:36.333 --> 02:34:38.102
PROGRAM ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS

02:34:38.168 --> 02:34:39.770
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS THERE

02:34:39.837 --> 02:34:42.172
IS A CURRENTLY A PROGRAM CALLED

02:34:42.239 --> 02:34:43.674
CAMP T..

02:34:43.741 --> 02:34:44.842
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE

02:34:44.908 --> 02:34:46.644
ACRONYM IS BUT IT BASICALLY

02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:49.113
ALLOWS FOR THE ASSESSMENT.

02:34:49.179 --> 02:34:51.682
OF MINES ABANDONED MINES IN THE

02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:53.484
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT MIGHT BE.

02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:55.185
AN APPROACH METHODOLOGY THAT

02:34:55.252 --> 02:34:57.721
WILL WANT TO USE HERE -- AND AND

02:34:57.788 --> 02:34:59.456
CERTAINLY ONE THAT -- I THINK

02:34:59.523 --> 02:35:00.958
HAS SOME MERIT TO IT AND IS THE

02:35:01.025 --> 02:35:02.893
BILL PROCEEDS I THINK BASICALLY

02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.228
THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF

02:35:04.294 --> 02:35:06.096
THIS BILL.

02:35:06.163 --> 02:35:07.631
ARE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

02:35:07.698 --> 02:35:09.433
WHEN I HEAR THAT THE?

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:10.834
INDUSTRY THE ORAL INDUSTRY SAYS

02:35:10.901 --> 02:35:14.772
THAT THEY OF THEY HAVE MADE

02:35:14.838 --> 02:35:15.839
FINANCIAL ASSURANCES.

02:35:15.906 --> 02:35:16.607
CLEARLY THE FACT THAT THE STATE

02:35:16.674 --> 02:35:17.274
OF CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY HAD TO

02:35:17.341 --> 02:35:18.242
PUT DOWN A HUNDRED MILLION

02:35:18.308 --> 02:35:19.877
DOLLARS AND HAS BEEN ASKED TO

02:35:19.943 --> 02:35:21.412
PUT DOWN FOR MILLION MORE. FOR

02:35:21.478 --> 02:35:24.114
LITIGATION -- BECAUSE THE

02:35:24.181 --> 02:35:25.582
COMPANIES SAID OF ABANDONED

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:27.418
THESE WELLS WANT THE STATE TO

02:35:27.484 --> 02:35:29.787
CONTINUE TO PAY. TO MAINTAIN

02:35:29.853 --> 02:35:32.623
THEM WHILE THEY ARE BEING DE.

02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:34.692
I'M I FIND IT ACTUALLY KIND OF

02:35:34.758 --> 02:35:35.959
AN OUTRAGE TO THE STATE THAT

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:37.027
WOULD THAT THOSE THAT THE

02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:39.697
TAXPAYERS ARE HAVING TO PAY.

02:35:39.763 --> 02:35:42.299
THE OIL INDUSTRY EXPENSES AFTER

02:35:42.366 --> 02:35:43.367
THEY HAVE.

02:35:43.434 --> 02:35:44.902
TAKEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

02:35:44.968 --> 02:35:46.036
PROFIT INTERESTS LITERALLY

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:48.005
WALKED AWAY IT'S LIKE THE CHILD

02:35:48.072 --> 02:35:49.473
WHO.

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:50.207
DOESN'T WANT TO CLEAN UP THE

02:35:50.274 --> 02:35:54.311
ROOM AND SAYS YOU DO IT FOR ME.

02:35:54.378 --> 02:35:55.212
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'VE

02:35:55.279 --> 02:35:55.779
GOT HERE SO THE PRINCIPLE I

02:35:55.846 --> 02:35:58.148
BELIEVE IS AN APPROPRIATE -- ONE

02:35:58.215 --> 02:36:00.284
WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING

02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:02.252
TO WORK WITH IT -- THIS ISSUE WE

02:36:02.319 --> 02:36:04.521
HAVE HAD LEGISLATION I WOULD

02:36:04.588 --> 02:36:06.123
LIKE.

02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:07.091
TO WE KNOW THAT THE CENTER

02:36:07.157 --> 02:36:07.791
HERTZBERG IS DONE WITH SOME

02:36:07.858 --> 02:36:09.560
LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THE

02:36:09.626 --> 02:36:12.162
BONDING COSTS TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:13.997
THERE ARE EXPANSIONS OF OIL

02:36:14.064 --> 02:36:15.466
DRILLING BUT THAT ISN'T ENOUGH

02:36:15.532 --> 02:36:16.900
THAT ISN'T GOING.

02:36:16.967 --> 02:36:18.469
TO COVER THE COSTS OF

02:36:18.535 --> 02:36:19.837
DECOMMISSIONING IT'S A

02:36:19.903 --> 02:36:21.739
MAINTAINING THEM SO THAT'S WHAT

02:36:21.805 --> 02:36:23.674
THIS BILL -- TRIES TO SET UP

02:36:23.741 --> 02:36:25.242
THAT METHODOLOGY SO THE GOING

02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:27.711
FORWARD PERHAPS THE STATE CAN

02:36:27.778 --> 02:36:29.213
RECOUP SOME OF THOSE COSTS

02:36:29.279 --> 02:36:30.380
RATHER THAN.

02:36:30.447 --> 02:36:32.349
HAVE THE OIL INDUSTRY CONTINUE

02:36:32.416 --> 02:36:33.851
JUST TO WALK AWAY AND LEAVE THE

02:36:33.917 --> 02:36:35.819
THE TAX PAYERS CALIFORNIA

02:36:35.886 --> 02:36:36.954
HOLDING THE BACK HE SAID I WILL

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:38.522
PUT IT IS THIS IS THIS IS YOUR

02:36:38.589 --> 02:36:39.690
FIRST COMMITTEE RIGHT THAT'S

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:40.624
CORRECT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT.

02:36:40.691 --> 02:36:42.392
STILL A LONG WAY TO GO AND A LOT

02:36:42.459 --> 02:36:43.627
OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOR

02:36:43.694 --> 02:36:46.764
EVERYONE AWAY AND CENTER

02:36:46.830 --> 02:36:48.432
HERTZBERG.

02:36:48.499 --> 02:36:50.667
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON WIENER

02:36:50.734 --> 02:36:51.668
STAND IS HOW ALL THIS WHAT

02:36:51.735 --> 02:36:52.236
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

02:36:52.302 --> 02:36:54.438
SOLVES THIS PET PLATFORM HOLLY

02:36:54.505 --> 02:36:55.672
PROBLEMA AB.

02:36:55.739 --> 02:36:57.341
APOLOGIES AND FOCUS OF ATTENTION

02:36:57.407 --> 02:36:59.710
EARLIER BUT WHEN I WAS HERE THIS

02:36:59.777 --> 02:37:01.311
COMMITTEE WE HAD THE HORRIBLE

02:37:01.378 --> 02:37:02.980
SITUATION PLATFORM HOLLY.

02:37:03.046 --> 02:37:04.681
AND WHAT WE LEARN WE LEARN THE

02:37:04.748 --> 02:37:06.383
COMPANY FILED BANKRUPTCY UNDER

02:37:06.450 --> 02:37:08.352
BANKRUPTCY LAWS NO MATTER HOW

02:37:08.418 --> 02:37:09.720
OLD THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE.

02:37:09.787 --> 02:37:11.588
THERE WERE STOCK FOR STOCK RIGHT

02:37:11.655 --> 02:37:12.456
BECAUSE IF THEY POLLUTE THE

02:37:12.523 --> 02:37:13.290
ENVIRONMENT SOMEBODY GOES

02:37:13.357 --> 02:37:14.792
BANKRUPT THERE'S NO WAY TO GO UP

02:37:14.858 --> 02:37:15.859
THE LIABILITY CHAIN WERE IN

02:37:15.926 --> 02:37:16.426
TROUBLE.

02:37:16.493 --> 02:37:18.061
SO THE NEXT YEAR AS A RESULT OF

02:37:18.128 --> 02:37:19.496
THE VARIOUS MEETINGS THAT WE HAD

02:37:19.563 --> 02:37:22.132
WE CREATED A PROCESS TO CREATE

02:37:22.199 --> 02:37:24.034
AN ASSESSMENT TO INCREASE THE

02:37:24.101 --> 02:37:25.502
AMOUNT OF THE BOND BECAUSE WE'RE

02:37:25.569 --> 02:37:27.004
FINDING IS THAT THE BIG WEALTHY

02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:28.839
OIL COMPANIES WERE SELLING OFF

02:37:28.906 --> 02:37:29.439
THESE.

02:37:29.506 --> 02:37:30.974
THESE FACILITIES WHEN THEY'RE ON

02:37:31.041 --> 02:37:32.543
THE TAIL END THE COMPANY'S A

02:37:32.609 --> 02:37:34.178
DIDN'T HAVE SIGNIFICANT BALANCE

02:37:34.244 --> 02:37:35.846
SHEETS SIGNIFICANT THOSE

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:37.514
COMPANIES WOULD GRAB WITH THE

02:37:37.581 --> 02:37:38.615
GRAB FILE BE QUE.

02:37:38.682 --> 02:37:40.484
AND WE WERE LEFT EXPOSED HENCE

02:37:40.551 --> 02:37:42.019
WHY WERE IN THE SITUATION FOR

02:37:42.085 --> 02:37:43.754
THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PLUS

02:37:43.821 --> 02:37:44.822
MILLION DOLLARS AND PLATFORM ALI.

02:37:44.888 --> 02:37:47.057
AND HENCE WHY WE DID LEGISLATION

02:37:47.124 --> 02:37:49.359
WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION

02:37:49.426 --> 02:37:50.460
TO BE ABLE TO TO DEAL WITH THAT

02:37:50.527 --> 02:37:52.229
WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS

02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:53.263
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN

02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:54.765
TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING

02:37:54.832 --> 02:37:56.333
ARCHITECTURE THE FINANCIAL RISK.

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:58.335
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW

02:37:58.402 --> 02:37:59.937
HAVING A PLAN DOES ANYTHING

02:38:00.003 --> 02:38:00.537
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT

02:38:00.604 --> 02:38:01.738
MATTERS WHEN YOU SEE THE

02:38:01.805 --> 02:38:03.273
TAXPAYERS ARE GONNA GET HELD

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:05.242
ACCOUNTABLE THEY'RE GONNA GET

02:38:05.309 --> 02:38:06.543
ACCOUNT IS GOING TO HELL LIKE

02:38:06.610 --> 02:38:07.244
WE'RE SEEING IN THAT THEIR

02:38:07.311 --> 02:38:08.478
BANKRUPTCIES WITH OTHER.

02:38:08.545 --> 02:38:10.547
PUBLICLY RELATED ENTITIES HOW TO

02:38:10.614 --> 02:38:12.049
HAVING A PLAN WHAT YOU NEED IS

02:38:12.115 --> 02:38:14.585
MORE COVERAGE MORE PROTECTION

02:38:14.651 --> 02:38:16.153
LESS THOUGHT MORE THORNY IT

02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:18.121
SEEMS TO ME TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:38:18.188 --> 02:38:19.656
BEFORE YOU APPROVE A TRANSFER.

02:38:19.723 --> 02:38:20.924
YOU MAKE SURE SOMEBODY HAS A

02:38:20.991 --> 02:38:22.259
BALANCE SHEET THAT IF THERE'S A

02:38:22.326 --> 02:38:24.695
PROBLEM YOU CAN PAY FOR IT RIGHT

02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:26.463
AND WHO CARES IF A IF A BOND IS

02:38:26.530 --> 02:38:27.798
TEN X. OVER ABOVE WITH THE

02:38:27.865 --> 02:38:29.099
ACTUAL LIABILITY IS.

02:38:29.166 --> 02:38:31.401
SPENDING MONEY TO DO THIS SEEMS

02:38:31.468 --> 02:38:34.071
TO ME -- THE IDEA IS CRITICALLY

02:38:34.137 --> 02:38:35.606
IMPORTANT THE TWENTY SEVEN WELLS

02:38:35.672 --> 02:38:37.074
IS NO QUESTION THAT WE SOUGHT

02:38:37.140 --> 02:38:37.741
HAPPENED WE BOTH WERE INVOLVED

02:38:37.808 --> 02:38:38.475
WITH IT.

02:38:38.542 --> 02:38:40.210
BUT I'M TRYING TO GET TO HOW

02:38:40.277 --> 02:38:41.845
HAVING ANOTHER STUDY IN ANOTHER

02:38:41.912 --> 02:38:43.780
ASSESSMENT GETS THIS I'D RATHER

02:38:43.847 --> 02:38:51.755
HAVE AN APPROVAL PROCESS BEFORE

02:38:51.822 --> 02:38:52.389
WE ALLOWED THESE PHONY TRANSFERS

02:38:52.456 --> 02:38:53.857
TO HAVE.

02:38:53.924 --> 02:38:54.825
THAT WE MADE SURE WHOEVER THE

02:38:54.892 --> 02:38:56.293
NEW ENTITY WAS HAD SUFFICIENT

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.628
CAPITAL RESERVES AND OR BOTH BE

02:38:57.694 --> 02:38:58.929
INSURANCE OR BONDS OR WHATEVER

02:38:58.996 --> 02:38:59.129
THAT.

02:38:59.196 --> 02:39:00.364
THEY GET A CLEAN UP TO THE

02:39:00.430 --> 02:39:02.132
STANDARDS THAT THE BIG STORY FOR

02:39:02.199 --> 02:39:04.768
QUITE A I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO

02:39:04.835 --> 02:39:05.869
HIT THAT ONE IT IS LIKE THAT --

02:39:05.936 --> 02:39:06.937
BUT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER BILL

02:39:07.004 --> 02:39:07.971
THAT'S ANOTHER BILL WHAT WE WANT

02:39:08.038 --> 02:39:10.307
TO DO IS BE ABLE TO ASSESS.

02:39:10.374 --> 02:39:12.843
THE VARIOUS ON SHORE AS WELL AS

02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:14.811
OFFSHORE WELLS ARE OUT THERE --

02:39:14.878 --> 02:39:17.047
TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE FULL SCOPE

02:39:17.114 --> 02:39:19.383
OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARE

02:39:19.449 --> 02:39:21.118
WORKING IN CONJUNCTION THIRD

02:39:21.184 --> 02:39:22.586
THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

02:39:22.653 --> 02:39:23.987
WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

02:39:24.054 --> 02:39:25.522
NOTION THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:39:25.589 --> 02:39:27.491
START SEEING TRANSFERS OR FOR

02:39:27.557 --> 02:39:28.725
GOING TO SEE EXPANSION.

02:39:28.792 --> 02:39:31.728
OF OIL DRILLING THAT WE TRY.

02:39:31.795 --> 02:39:33.830
TO ANTICIPATE POTENTIAL FUTURE

02:39:33.897 --> 02:39:35.899
LIABILITY SO THAT WE CAN EITHER

02:39:35.966 --> 02:39:37.334
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL BONDING OR WE

02:39:37.401 --> 02:39:39.336
CAN TAKE OTHER MECHANISMS THAT

02:39:39.403 --> 02:39:41.138
MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE AS

02:39:41.204 --> 02:39:43.173
YOU KNOW -- THE BONDING DOESN'T

02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:45.742
NECESSARILY ADDRESS ALL THE

02:39:45.809 --> 02:39:46.877
ASPECTS WHEN THEY'RE DE

02:39:46.944 --> 02:39:47.844
COMMISSIONED.

02:39:47.911 --> 02:39:50.414
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:51.615
THAT DATA IN THIS SET UP THAT

02:39:51.682 --> 02:39:53.617
METHODOLOGY SO THAT AT LEAST WE

02:39:53.684 --> 02:39:55.218
HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY WILL

02:39:55.285 --> 02:39:56.920
BE FOLLOWING TO A STEP

02:39:56.987 --> 02:39:58.355
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT I HOPE.

02:39:58.422 --> 02:39:59.890
THAT WILL BE TAKEN BUT THIS IS

02:39:59.957 --> 02:40:01.992
THE FIRST STEP TO AT LEAST BE

02:40:02.059 --> 02:40:04.061
ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE

02:40:04.127 --> 02:40:05.862
POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ARE AND I

02:40:05.929 --> 02:40:07.331
COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE I'D

02:40:07.397 --> 02:40:07.998
LIKE TO SEE.

02:40:08.065 --> 02:40:10.000
WHEN THE NOTION THAT WE'RE STUCK

02:40:10.067 --> 02:40:11.468
WITH PLATFORM HOLLY AND THAT THE

02:40:11.535 --> 02:40:13.537
STATE IS PAYING HUNDREDS OF

02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:14.972
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS?

02:40:15.038 --> 02:40:16.873
BECAUSE THE COMPANY THAT NOW ON

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:18.542
TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY IN THE

02:40:18.608 --> 02:40:24.448
BONDING WASN'T LARGE ENOUGH IS

02:40:24.514 --> 02:40:26.817
IT CHOSE CORALS.

02:40:26.883 --> 02:40:28.151
THE HAIR ON MY BACK I CHOSE

02:40:28.218 --> 02:40:28.919
STUFF.

02:40:28.986 --> 02:40:30.587
I I JUST FIND IT SO OFFENSIVE --

02:40:30.654 --> 02:40:31.888
BUT THAT IS AS YOU SAY THEY'VE

02:40:31.955 --> 02:40:32.689
DECLARE BANKRUPTCY BUT GOING

02:40:32.756 --> 02:40:33.924
FORWARD PERHAPS WE CAN BE BETTER

02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:35.325
PREPARED THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

02:40:35.392 --> 02:40:38.462
IT'S ONE OF THE TOOLS IN THE

02:40:38.528 --> 02:40:41.331
TOOLBOX TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN

02:40:41.398 --> 02:40:41.631
[inaudible]

02:40:41.698 --> 02:40:43.900
HERTZBERG. FOR THE THOUGHTS OKAY

02:40:43.967 --> 02:40:44.201
[inaudible]

02:40:44.267 --> 02:40:47.637
I OKAY I JUST HAVE YES CENTER

02:40:47.704 --> 02:40:52.542
WEST OF THIS GENERALLY -- WE'VE

02:40:52.609 --> 02:40:54.411
GOT A HAVE YOU KNOW.

02:40:54.478 --> 02:40:55.746
WE'VE WE'VE ADDRESSED --

02:40:55.812 --> 02:40:57.848
CONTAMINATION IN OUR STATE

02:40:57.914 --> 02:41:01.718
THROUGH FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES

02:41:01.785 --> 02:41:02.019
[inaudible]

02:41:02.085 --> 02:41:04.588
WHERE REGARDLESS OF WHO OWNS THE

02:41:04.654 --> 02:41:06.623
PROPERTY CURRENTLY THAT YOU

02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.191
COULD GO BACK AND TITLE?

02:41:08.258 --> 02:41:10.260
AND INVESTIGATE WHO USED TO BE

02:41:10.327 --> 02:41:11.161
THE OWNER AND WHO ACTUALLY

02:41:11.228 --> 02:41:12.863
BECAUSE THE CONTAMINATION AND

02:41:12.929 --> 02:41:14.731
ACTUALLY.

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:16.633
TAKE SPECIFICALLY GALACTION

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:17.934
GOING TO CONSERVE PEOPLE MY

02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:20.604
SUSPICION IS THAT IN AND IN THE

02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:23.473
CASE OF OF HOLLY.

02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:25.642
THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNERS SOLD

02:41:25.709 --> 02:41:27.444
MADE A TON OF MONEY.

02:41:27.511 --> 02:41:30.914
SOLD TO A SHELL CORPORATION THAT

02:41:30.981 --> 02:41:33.050
DIDN'T HAVE ASSETS [inaudible]

02:41:33.116 --> 02:41:41.124
AND WHAT THE WHAT THE SIMPLE --

02:41:41.191 --> 02:41:46.329
A STRATEGY TO BASICALLY.

02:41:46.396 --> 02:41:48.865
REMOVE THEMSELVES OF A LIABILITY.

02:41:48.932 --> 02:41:51.234
AND OF A RESPONSIBILITY.

02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:54.838
SO CAN WE USE THE SUPERFUND

02:41:54.905 --> 02:41:58.508
MECHANISM TO KIND OF SU.

02:41:58.575 --> 02:42:00.210
THE OWNERS OF THE PREVIOUS

02:42:00.277 --> 02:42:02.179
OWNERS OF HOLLY AND HAVE THEM

02:42:02.245 --> 02:42:03.713
CLEAN IT UP WELL THAT'S

02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:05.449
SOMETHING IS WE LOOK IN A SENSE

02:42:05.515 --> 02:42:07.350
WHAT THE COSTS ARE IS IT THE

02:42:07.417 --> 02:42:08.585
PROBABLY A GOOD QUESTION

02:42:08.652 --> 02:42:10.420
UNFORTUNATELY IS /

02:42:10.487 --> 02:42:13.723
KNOW -- THE SUPER FUND -- SYSTEM

02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:15.225
IS NOT BEING FUNDED BY THE FED

02:42:15.292 --> 02:42:16.927
SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THE

02:42:16.993 --> 02:42:20.831
SUPERFUND SITES CONTINUING. TO

02:42:20.897 --> 02:42:24.201
MAINTAIN THE LEVELS OF TOXICITY

02:42:24.267 --> 02:42:26.203
IN DANGER TO OUR ENVIRONMENT.

02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:27.971
THAT -- THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT'S

02:42:28.038 --> 02:42:29.539
A THE SUBSET OF LAWS THAT ALLOWS

02:42:29.606 --> 02:42:35.212
PEOPLE TO SEEK DAMAGES YES.

02:42:35.278 --> 02:42:37.481
YES AND AND I YOU KNOW I I

02:42:37.547 --> 02:42:38.748
SUPPORT THIS WORK AND I JUST

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:39.783
THINK THAT THE THE INDUSTRY'S

02:42:39.850 --> 02:42:42.752
BRINGING THIS UPON THEMSELVES.

02:42:42.819 --> 02:42:45.222
BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO

02:42:45.288 --> 02:42:47.757
TRY OUR STATE AND AND I I I

02:42:47.824 --> 02:42:48.992
COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THE

02:42:49.059 --> 02:42:51.061
COMMENTS OF OF CENTER HERTZBERG

02:42:51.128 --> 02:42:53.763
AND AND HOW HE CHARACTERIZED THE

02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:55.632
NATURE OF THE PROBLEM AND I

02:42:55.699 --> 02:42:57.467
WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU. TO

02:42:57.534 --> 02:42:59.136
LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS ON HOW WE

02:42:59.202 --> 02:43:02.506
CAN -- PURSUE THIS INCLUDING.

02:43:02.572 --> 02:43:04.307
OPENING UP THE ABILITY TO GO

02:43:04.374 --> 02:43:05.809
AFTER PREVIOUS OWNERS.

02:43:05.876 --> 02:43:07.444
WELL I KNOW HAT THAT IS ONE OF

02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:08.445
THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

02:43:08.512 --> 02:43:10.614
DOING AND THAT IN FACT THE

02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:13.517
ORIGINAL OWNER DID HAVE A A BOND

02:43:13.583 --> 02:43:14.784
THE RICH ALONE I BELIEVE THIS

02:43:14.851 --> 02:43:15.952
ONE OF THE LARGE.

02:43:16.019 --> 02:43:17.787
OIL COMPANIES AND AS YOU SAID

02:43:17.854 --> 02:43:18.855
THEY KEEP SELLING THEM DOWN THE

02:43:18.922 --> 02:43:20.157
ROAD FOR SOMEWHERE IN THERE

02:43:20.223 --> 02:43:22.492
SOMEBODY MADE AN ENORMOUS PROFIT --

02:43:22.559 --> 02:43:24.761
YOU CAN BE SURE THAT CAN BE

02:43:24.828 --> 02:43:26.663
THROUGH A KIND OF AN EVENT ENTRY

02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:29.099
PROCESS THE PROBLEM IS SAID THE

02:43:29.166 --> 02:43:31.568
CURRENT OWNER IT IS -- DECLARED

02:43:31.635 --> 02:43:33.803
BANKRUPTCY THE PRIOR OWNER THAT

02:43:33.870 --> 02:43:35.272
WE DISCOVERED THAT THE BONDING

02:43:35.338 --> 02:43:37.174
WHICH WAS DONE PROBABLY FORTY

02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:39.209
YEARS AGO WAS WHOLLY INADEQUATE

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:40.443
TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:43:40.510 --> 02:43:43.346
WITH IT TODAY -- AND I'M SURE

02:43:43.413 --> 02:43:44.948
THERE'S LITIGATION GOING.

02:43:45.015 --> 02:43:46.783
ON THAT ISSUE BUT THIS IS

02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:48.718
ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AS

02:43:48.785 --> 02:43:50.554
WE TRY TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:52.722
YES THIS INDUSTRY IS NOTORIOUS

02:43:52.789 --> 02:43:54.558
FOR ITS UNWILLINGNESS TO TAKE.

02:43:54.624 --> 02:43:56.359
RESPONSIBILITY WHETHER

02:43:56.426 --> 02:44:03.934
ENVIRONMENTALLY OR FINANCIALLY I

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.235
SEE THE TEARS ON HERE BUT I I

02:44:05.302 --> 02:44:05.869
DON'T KNOW THE STATE OF

02:44:05.936 --> 02:44:07.304
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE --

02:44:07.370 --> 02:44:08.872
BUT SEEING THAT IT IT IS A

02:44:08.939 --> 02:44:10.140
MENTALLY WORK IN PROGRESS I CAN

02:44:10.207 --> 02:44:11.074
HEAR YOU.

02:44:11.141 --> 02:44:13.043
COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK

02:44:13.109 --> 02:44:14.945
ABSOLUTELY TO MAKE SURE WE FLUSH

02:44:15.011 --> 02:44:15.712
OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT AND

02:44:15.779 --> 02:44:17.681
RAISED AND YOU KNOW I KNOW I

02:44:17.747 --> 02:44:18.315
UNDERSTAND YOU NEVER GONNA COME

02:44:18.381 --> 02:44:21.785
TO A COMBINED A MOMENT WITH THE

02:44:21.851 --> 02:44:23.119
OPPOSITION BUT COULD YOU GIVE US

02:44:23.186 --> 02:44:24.487
YOUR READ ON THE STATE OF PLAY

02:44:24.554 --> 02:44:24.688

NEGOTIATIONS AND AND YOUR WORK

02:44:26.256 --> 02:44:27.090
WITH THE COMMITTEE MOVING

02:44:27.157 --> 02:44:28.525
FORWARD ON THE STRETCHER WELL WE

02:44:28.592 --> 02:44:29.559
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

02:44:29.626 --> 02:44:30.860
COMMITTEE AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY

02:44:30.927 --> 02:44:33.096
HELPFUL -- IT'S IT IS A LITTLE

02:44:33.163 --> 02:44:35.031
FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

02:44:35.098 --> 02:44:37.734
NICE IF WE COULD IDENTIFY.

02:44:37.801 --> 02:44:40.103
WHERE THE THE THE MONEY?

02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:42.739

BACK ON BEHALF OF THE TAXPAYERS

02:44:44.574 --> 02:44:45.408
A CALIFORNIA.

02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:47.978
BUT WE RIGHT NOW THIS IS A

02:44:48.044 --> 02:44:50.247
MEASURE THAT IS JUST TRYING TO

02:44:50.313 --> 02:44:51.781
LOOK AT ALL THE BIGGER PICTURE I

02:44:51.848 --> 02:44:54.818
THERE WAS MENTION THEIR TWO

02:44:54.884 --> 02:44:55.385
HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:55.619
WELLS.

02:44:55.685 --> 02:44:57.153
THIS OIL AND GAS WELLS IN THE

02:44:57.220 --> 02:44:58.855
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BOTH ONSHORE

02:44:58.922 --> 02:45:01.091
AND OFFSHORE AND I THINK THIS

02:45:01.157 --> 02:45:02.826
THIS IS A MEASURE WHERE WERE

02:45:02.892 --> 02:45:06.096
TRUST TRYING.

02:45:06.162 --> 02:45:07.530
TO IDENTIFY.

02:45:07.597 --> 02:45:08.798

ABANDONED MINES I THINK IT'S

02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:18.608
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD VERY

02:45:18.675 --> 02:45:21.511
POSSIBLY ADOPT.

02:45:21.578 --> 02:45:23.647

BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A JUDICATA

03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:45.888
ANYTHING DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF

03:02:45.954 --> 03:02:46.121

03:03:08.377 --> 03:03:10.045
ON THE NONPROFIT THAT I'D HAVE A

03:03:10.112 --> 03:03:15.651
LEGITIMATE STAKE IN IT I FEEL --

03:03:15.718 --> 03:03:17.019
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN

03:03:17.086 --> 03:03:18.053
MEET THE THRESHOLD THAT SO MAYBE

03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:19.154
WE IF IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD

03:03:19.221 --> 03:03:20.055
TODAY MAY WE CAN.

03:03:20.122 --> 03:03:21.190

[inaudible]

03:03:28.931 --> 03:03:31.800
OKAY.

03:03:31.867 --> 03:03:33.168
NO NO WHAT WE'RE OKAY WITH IT

03:03:33.235 --> 03:03:34.436
THE ONE OTHER THE ONLY OTHER

03:03:34.503 --> 03:03:36.205
QUESTION I HAD WAS JUST HOW HOW

03:03:36.271 --> 03:03:40.309
DOES THIS.

03:03:40.376 --> 03:03:41.944
HOW DOES THIS DIFFER A WAR IN

03:03:42.010 --> 03:03:44.079
YOUR VIEW IMPROVE ON THE BCP WE

03:03:44.146 --> 03:03:46.482

BUT WE ACTED IN BUDGET SUB TO I

03:03:50.919 --> 03:03:53.455
THINK WE MADE A RUEFUL HOW WOULD

03:03:53.522 --> 03:03:55.657
THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK.

03:03:55.724 --> 03:03:58.293
WITH THIS SO WHAT COULD WE WITH

03:03:58.360 --> 03:03:59.762
THIS SORT OF WITH THIS REQUIRES.

03:04:02.197 --> 03:04:04.500
NEW ACT.

03:04:04.566 --> 03:04:07.403
MY ANALYSIS IS THAT THE IS.

03:04:07.469 --> 03:04:09.505
IT THIS IS A BILL -- THE BEASTIE

03:04:09.571 --> 03:04:12.841

OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO BE TO

03:04:18.847 --> 03:04:20.682
BECOME OPERATIONAL AT SOME POINT

03:04:20.749 --> 03:04:24.420
HOW WE CHANGE THE FUNDING FOR IT --

03:04:24.486 --> 03:04:27.456
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEGISLATIVE

03:04:27.523 --> 03:04:27.756

THE FACT THAT THE GREATEST

03:10:26.681 --> 03:10:27.749
I BELIEVE THESE FACTS ALONE IN

LIGHT OF THE CAMPFIRE ILLUSTRATE

03:10:29.251 --> 03:10:30.886
THAT THE THREAT HAS SHIFTED

03:10:30.952 --> 03:10:32.554
SINCE INCEPTION OF BYRON PROGRAM.

03:10:32.621 --> 03:10:33.688

03:15:34.856 --> 03:15:36.458
WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS THE

03:15:36.524 --> 03:15:40.295
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THOSE MAPS --

03:15:40.361 --> 03:15:41.763
THOSE MAPS STILL FAIL. TO

03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:43.631
PROVIDE US COMMUNITY PROTECTION

03:15:43.698 --> 03:15:44.999
ON THEIR OWN AND WHAT WE

03:15:45.066 --> 03:15:46.434
ESSENTIALLY HAVE [inaudible]

03:15:46.501 --> 03:15:48.069
IS.

03:15:48.136 --> 03:15:52.006
A PRIOR THE ABILITY NOW.

03:15:52.073 --> 03:15:54.843
FOR PROJECTS TO PRIORITIZE EXT.

03:15:54.909 --> 03:15:56.344
EXTRACTION OF WOOD IN THOSE

03:15:56.411 --> 03:15:58.680
AREAS THAT ARE MOST.

03:15:58.746 --> 03:16:01.249
THAT ARE CLOSEST TO AND MOST.

03:16:01.316 --> 03:16:03.518
THAT'S A BALL FOR BIOMASS PLANTS

03:16:03.585 --> 03:16:04.285
ALL WE'RE DOING HERE IS

03:16:04.352 --> 03:16:06.754
EXPANDING HOW EASILY.

03:16:06.821 --> 03:16:08.022
DOM THOSE BOUNOUS PLANTS CAN

03:16:08.089 --> 03:16:09.157
PULL FROM THE AREAS THAT ARE

03:16:09.224 --> 03:16:11.793
CLOSEST TO THEM THAT DOES NOT

03:16:11.860 --> 03:16:12.961
PROVIDE US ON THE PHONE.

03:16:13.027 --> 03:16:14.629
HOME PROTECTION BUT DOES NOT

03:16:14.696 --> 03:16:16.197
PROVIDE US COMMUNITY DEFENSIBLE

03:16:16.264 --> 03:16:17.398
SPACES.

03:16:17.465 --> 03:16:21.069
AND AGAIN I FEEL LIKE THIS TEN

03:16:21.136 --> 03:16:23.505
CHILE -- ON A PROJECT THE

03:16:23.571 --> 03:16:24.139
PROJECT LEVEL MAY ACTUALLY BE

03:16:24.205 --> 03:16:26.441
DISTRACTING US FROM THE WORK OF

03:16:26.508 --> 03:16:28.176
ON HOME PROTECTION.

03:16:28.243 --> 03:16:30.044
THAT SAID THOUGH THE LAST THING

03:16:30.111 --> 03:16:32.514
TO MENTION FOR ME IS THAT --

03:16:32.580 --> 03:16:33.982
RATHER THAN CATEGORICALLY

03:16:34.048 --> 03:16:35.717
EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF

03:16:35.783 --> 03:16:37.819
ELIGIBLE BIOMASS FEEDSTOCK.

03:16:37.886 --> 03:16:39.354
THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

03:16:39.420 --> 03:16:41.823
IS BEST SITUATED TO MAKE THESE

03:16:41.890 --> 03:16:43.458
INTENSELY FACT SPECIFIC

03:16:43.525 --> 03:16:44.792
DETERMINATION.

03:16:44.859 --> 03:16:46.261
AND ALREADY HAS A SYSTEM IN

03:16:46.327 --> 03:16:49.297
PLACE TO DO -- RECENT CPUC

03:16:49.364 --> 03:16:51.366
RESOLUTION -- INVESTOR OWNED

03:16:51.432 --> 03:16:53.468
UTILITIES HAVE THE POWER TO

03:16:53.535 --> 03:16:55.537
AMEND BIRAM CONTRACTS TO ALLOW

03:16:55.603 --> 03:16:57.405
FACILITIES TO HELP SALVAGE

03:16:57.472 --> 03:16:59.140
BIOMASS FROM THESE.

03:16:59.207 --> 03:17:01.009
AREAS I'M TOWARD THEIR STOCK

03:17:01.075 --> 03:17:03.211
REQUIREMENT AFTER A WILD FIRE

03:17:03.278 --> 03:17:06.114
EVENT -- AND AND ACTUALLY

03:17:06.181 --> 03:17:09.317
POTENTIALLY IN RESPONSE -- TO BY

03:17:09.384 --> 03:17:10.985
REDUCTION PROJECTS COMMISSION

03:17:11.052 --> 03:17:12.520
RULED THAT THESE AMENDMENTS

03:17:12.587 --> 03:17:15.123
SHOULD BE EVALUATED ON A CASE BY

03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:18.893
CASE BASIS -- AND AS ASSIST. FOR

03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:20.662
DOING THAT.

03:17:20.728 --> 03:17:21.396
AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE

03:17:21.462 --> 03:17:23.932
LEGISLATURE OVERRIDE THAT KIND

03:17:23.998 --> 03:17:27.068
OF SITE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS.

03:17:27.135 --> 03:17:29.237
THAT SAID -- BUT THAT WAS

03:17:29.304 --> 03:17:30.505
INITIALLY PUT IN PLACE WAS

03:17:30.572 --> 03:17:31.706
SPECIFICALLY.

03:17:31.773 --> 03:17:34.809
IN RESPECT WITH RESPECT -- TO

03:17:34.876 --> 03:17:38.112
BOTH BUYER OUTRAGE THEY WOULD

03:17:38.179 --> 03:17:40.014
HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR YOU KNOW.

03:17:40.081 --> 03:17:40.615
AND WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT AN

03:17:40.682 --> 03:17:41.849
ART.

03:17:41.916 --> 03:17:46.354
WITH THAT WE DO -- YOU SEE MORE

03:17:46.421 --> 03:17:46.554

OR THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU.

03:17:52.927 --> 03:17:55.163

MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

03:17:58.266 --> 03:18:04.472
THE MOTION FROM CENTER BOARD YES --

03:18:04.539 --> 03:18:05.540
ONE QUESTION I JUST HAD FOR YOUR

03:18:05.607 --> 03:18:09.110
EXPERTS WHILE THEY'RE HERE.

03:18:09.177 --> 03:18:10.712
WE TALK A LOT OF FORESTRY.

03:18:10.778 --> 03:18:13.548
TODAY BUT THE FEEDSTOCK ITSELF

03:18:13.615 --> 03:18:16.184
IS NOT LIMITED I I KEEP THINKING

03:18:16.251 --> 03:18:16.384
BACK.

03:18:16.451 --> 03:18:19.621
TO THE CHAPARRAL AND SMALLER

03:18:19.687 --> 03:18:21.089
DIAMETER.

03:18:21.155 --> 03:18:24.025
YOU KNOW -- FUELS THAT ARE AT

03:18:24.092 --> 03:18:25.460
VERY PREVALENT IGNITION SOURCE

03:18:25.526 --> 03:18:29.197
IN. SEVEN EVEN PARTS THE CENTRAL

03:18:29.264 --> 03:18:31.733
VALLEY NOT THE BIG TREE STUFF

03:18:31.799 --> 03:18:33.434
WE'RE TALK ABOUT WITH SOME THIS

03:18:33.501 --> 03:18:36.137
DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES.

03:18:36.204 --> 03:18:38.406
HIS BIO ENERGY THE ONLY POSSIBLE

03:18:38.473 --> 03:18:39.907
SO SOLUTION.

03:18:39.974 --> 03:18:42.377
OUT THERE FOR THOSE KINDS OF THE

03:18:42.443 --> 03:18:43.578
STOCKS ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE

03:18:43.645 --> 03:18:45.413
MARKETS THAT ARE STARTING TO

03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:46.914
SHAPE UP WHERE WE HAVE.

03:18:46.981 --> 03:18:48.149
EITHER I MEAN I THINK WE HEARD

03:18:48.216 --> 03:18:49.584
FROM OF THE FOREST PRODUCTS

03:18:49.651 --> 03:18:50.752
COUNCIL.

03:18:50.818 --> 03:18:52.020
WORKING COMMITTEE BUT JUST TO

03:18:52.086 --> 03:18:53.521
GET A SENSE I MEAN I I KNOW THIS

03:18:53.588 --> 03:18:55.456
IS ONE PART OF THIS THE SOLUTION

03:18:55.523 --> 03:18:56.057
THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE BY

03:18:56.124 --> 03:18:57.692
JUST.

03:18:57.759 --> 03:18:58.993
I DON'T KNOW AND I'M TRYING TO

03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:00.361
GET A A BETTER MY HEAD AROUND

03:19:00.428 --> 03:19:01.496
ESPECIALLY WHAT'S GOING TO COME

03:19:01.562 --> 03:19:03.364
OUT OF HIS HAZ STUDY FROM THE UC

03:19:03.431 --> 03:19:05.099
I KNOW IT'S SORT OF OUTSIDE.

03:19:05.166 --> 03:19:06.968
BUT YU'RE THANK YOU CENTER YEAH

03:19:07.035 --> 03:19:10.705
THE FIRST OF ALL OF YOU.

03:19:10.772 --> 03:19:12.607
WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT

03:19:12.674 --> 03:19:14.242
CALIFORNIA'S VERY DIFFERENT

03:19:14.309 --> 03:19:15.443
VEGETATION TYPES.

03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:16.911
WOULD BE THE CHAPARRAL IN

03:19:16.978 --> 03:19:18.146
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

03:19:18.212 --> 03:19:20.548
OAK WOODLANDS AND AND THE NAPA

03:19:20.615 --> 03:19:23.251
VALLEY AREA OR ARE A KIND OF FOR

03:19:23.318 --> 03:19:27.655
FOREST -- IN EACH OF THOSE.

03:19:27.722 --> 03:19:28.756
SEVEN PRODUCTS FROM A RUB

03:19:28.823 --> 03:19:30.558
RESOURCES IN THOSE AREAS HAVE

03:19:30.625 --> 03:19:32.193
DIFFERENT USES THERE'S NOT A LOT

03:19:32.260 --> 03:19:34.495
OF USE FOR CHAPARRAL.

03:19:34.562 --> 03:19:37.632
NOT MUCH RIGHT -- OKAY IS IT HAS

03:19:37.699 --> 03:19:40.535
SOME LIMITATIONS -- GIVEN ITS

03:19:40.601 --> 03:19:42.637
SIZE -- ALL ALTHOUGH I

03:19:42.704 --> 03:19:45.173
UNDERSTAND THAT THE IT WAS OAK

03:19:45.239 --> 03:19:46.774
THAT WAS IN THE M..

03:19:46.841 --> 03:19:49.243
IF THE DRAW IN PARIS.

03:19:49.310 --> 03:19:51.346
MAYBE THEY WANT IN THE WORLD I

03:19:51.412 --> 03:19:52.647
DON'T KNOW.

03:19:52.714 --> 03:19:53.281
BUT I THINK THAT IT THE IN THE

03:19:53.348 --> 03:19:55.850
IN THE SHORT TERM -- PROBABLY

03:19:55.917 --> 03:19:57.285
BIMASS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

03:19:57.352 --> 03:20:00.188
BIO ENERGY OF LONGER TERM.

03:20:00.254 --> 03:20:01.856
THERE ARE SOME NEW WOOD PRODUCTS

03:20:01.923 --> 03:20:04.192
COMING -- THEN WE'RE NOT THERE

03:20:04.258 --> 03:20:06.160
YET CALIFORNIA BUT CROSS

03:20:06.227 --> 03:20:07.362
LAMINATED TIMBER SOME OF THE

03:20:07.428 --> 03:20:09.330
MASTER BURKE -- DOES IT HAVE

03:20:09.397 --> 03:20:11.899
SOME USE FOR SMALLER MATERIAL --

03:20:11.966 --> 03:20:13.701
THE KIND OF WASTE MATERIAL THEY

03:20:13.768 --> 03:20:15.703
WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT CAN

03:20:15.770 --> 03:20:17.438
OTHERWISE BE PRODUCTIVELY USED --

03:20:17.505 --> 03:20:21.175
SO -- YOU KNOW THE CONTRACTS

03:20:21.242 --> 03:20:23.478
THAT CURRENTLY EXIST -- FOR BIO

03:20:23.544 --> 03:20:25.580
RAM A CONTINUE TO BE SHORT TERM

03:20:25.646 --> 03:20:27.348
CONTRACTS ARE NOT A AND THOSE.

03:20:27.415 --> 03:20:28.583
OF WE'RE JUST MAKING IT.

03:20:28.649 --> 03:20:31.185
THIS BILL EASIER TO USE THAT

03:20:31.252 --> 03:20:33.354
MATERIAL BUT CAL FIRE HAS

03:20:33.421 --> 03:20:34.756
SPECIFICALLY DENTIFIED AS

03:20:34.822 --> 03:20:37.625
COMING FROM AREAS OF VERY HIGH

03:20:37.692 --> 03:20:37.825
RISK.

03:20:37.892 --> 03:20:38.526
OF FOR FIRE [inaudible]

03:20:38.593 --> 03:20:42.530
INSTEAD -- BUT I RECOGNIZE THIS

03:20:42.597 --> 03:20:45.032
IS ONE PART OF THE SOLUTION I I

03:20:45.099 --> 03:20:46.234
IT'S BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS

03:20:46.300 --> 03:20:47.902
MEASURE BUT I'M.

03:20:47.969 --> 03:20:49.203
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A

03:20:49.270 --> 03:20:51.139
SOLUTION SET LOOKS LIKE BESIDES

03:20:51.205 --> 03:20:52.874
JUST PRESCRIBE FIRE EVERYWHERE

03:20:52.940 --> 03:20:54.275
THROUGH THE CHAPARRAL AND I

03:20:54.342 --> 03:20:56.711
THESE MAY NOT BE THE THE RIGHT

03:20:56.778 --> 03:20:58.479
PLACE TO DO IT BUT I THINK WE'RE

03:20:58.546 --> 03:20:59.680
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND SOUTHERN

03:20:59.747 --> 03:21:02.116
CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE OPEN TO ALL

03:21:02.183 --> 03:21:03.951
SUGGESTIONS. TO COMPLICATE

03:21:04.018 --> 03:21:05.420
THINGS IS DOESN'T REALLY HAVE

03:21:05.486 --> 03:21:06.721
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WITH THE

03:21:06.788 --> 03:21:08.990
BILL BUT I'M HEARING MORE AND

03:21:09.056 --> 03:21:10.558
MORE FROM THE AGRICULTURAL

03:21:10.625 --> 03:21:12.326
INDUSTRY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

03:21:12.393 --> 03:21:14.896
WASTE -- THAT HERE TOO FOR COULD

03:21:14.962 --> 03:21:17.031
COULD HAVE BEEN -- USED A NOW

03:21:17.098 --> 03:21:18.733
WHAT IT'S OPEN BURNING IF YOU

03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:20.034
JUST PILE IT UP AND YOU YOU

03:21:20.101 --> 03:21:21.002
LIGHT A MATCH AND YOU GET NO

03:21:21.068 --> 03:21:23.838
ENERGY -- FROM IT BECAUSE IT'S

03:21:23.905 --> 03:21:24.672
IT'S JUST IT.

03:21:24.739 --> 03:21:27.642
IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO TRANSPORT.

03:21:27.708 --> 03:21:30.244
AND ANY TO WASTE PRODUCT IN THE

03:21:30.311 --> 03:21:31.679
SOONER YOU GET RID OF IT.

03:21:31.746 --> 03:21:33.214

WE WE HAVE THESE CHALLENGES WITH

03:21:35.249 --> 03:21:35.917
WITH WASTE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

03:21:35.983 --> 03:21:37.285
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE

03:21:37.351 --> 03:21:40.955
LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AND IT'S

03:21:41.022 --> 03:21:42.123
IT'S FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT AND TO

03:21:42.190 --> 03:21:43.758
MAKE IT EVEN MORE COMPLICATED.

03:21:43.825 --> 03:21:45.693
ALL THE PLASTIC THAT THEY USED

03:21:45.760 --> 03:21:46.861
TO GET SHIPPED TO CHINA OFF OF

03:21:46.928 --> 03:21:50.531
OF THE AG IS RIGHT NOW READING

03:21:50.598 --> 03:21:52.867
THIS -- BUILD UP AND SO.

THEY RECKON IT NO THE NARROWING

03:22:00.875 --> 03:22:02.076
IT GO WORKING WITH US.

03:22:02.143 --> 03:22:03.544
THEIR MONEY AROUND ANYWHERE HERE

IT WILL BIO AND GAS STANDARD AND

03:22:17.892 --> 03:22:19.393
RAN INTO SOME OF THESE BOMB OUT

03:22:19.460 --> 03:22:21.762
WITH A CHALLENGES BUT I DO THINK.

03:22:21.829 --> 03:22:23.297
I FIGURE OUT A IN A SUSTAINABLE

03:22:23.364 --> 03:22:24.298
AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY

03:22:24.365 --> 03:22:25.700
OF APPROACHING THIS QUESTION I

03:22:25.766 --> 03:22:28.002
THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE

03:22:28.069 --> 03:22:28.302
[inaudible]

03:22:28.369 --> 03:22:30.471

COMMITTEE WILL STAY VERY ENGAGED

03:22:34.108 --> 03:22:35.376
IN THIS BILL MOVIE FOR ITS

03:22:35.443 --> 03:22:37.478
ENSURE THAT THE WORST FEARS OF

03:22:37.545 --> 03:22:38.279
SOME OF OUR FRIENDS.

FROM OUT I MEAN YOU'RE NOT

03:22:39.580 --> 03:22:41.516
REALIZED WITH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
