THAT THEY DESERVE-

00:32:05.156 --> 00:32:07.091

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:36.200
LEVEL AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:38.970
BE- BEST FIT FOR THEIR

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:42.540
PARTICULAR DISTRICTS AND I DO

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:44.008
REMEMBER MY COLLEAGUE ARE YOU

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:46.544
MIGHT NOT REMEMBER SAYING- THE

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:48.379
A B. MINUS LOOK CONTROL FUND

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:51.883
FOR. IS BY AID ABOUT WHETHER A

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:54.018
TRIAL IS LEARN TO READ BASS

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:56.387
BALANCING ABOUT UNITS THAT BUT

00:35:56.454 --> 00:36:00.224
I ALL OUR BIKE A TRAIN OR

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.926
WHATEVER WHERE THEY COULD DO

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:03.227
THEIR THE STANDARD WOULD BE

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:06.564
THAT WE WILL GET THE ARE SO TO

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:14.171
RE AGES A IT WAS. IT WAS REALLY

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:16.641
GIVING A NOD TO THE DISTRICTS

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:19.310
REGARDING- WE WON'T WE TRUST

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:21.045
YOU THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:22.480
FUND OUR SCHOOLS AND SO THAT

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:25.116
MOVE FORWARD- BUT I'VE BEEN IN

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:27.618
THE CLASSROOM. FOR THIRTY YEARS

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.153
IN A VERY HIGH ACHIEVING

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.855
DISTRICT FULLER TO AN

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:32.924
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.692
ALL MY FOUR KIDS HAVE ATTENDED

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.160
THOSE DISTRICTS SO I HAVE A

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:37.595
HIGH REGARD FOR PUBLIC

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:40.097
EDUCATION. BUT THE TRUTH OF IT

00:36:40.164 --> 00:36:42.600
IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.502
SUPPLEMENT GRANTS RELATED TO

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.904
OUR E. L. LEARNERS RELATED TO

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:49.240
FOSTER KIDS IN OUR LOW SOCIAL

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:53.110
ECONOMIC- STUDENTS. WE CONTINUE

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:57.148
TO SEE A MAJOR ISSUE BETWEEN

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:58.316
EQUALITY AND EQUITY. AND I HAVE

00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:00.785
SEEN FIRST HAND DISTRICT AFTER

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.153
DISTRICT SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:04.155
AFTER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:06.223
PARENTS WHO HAVE A VERY VERY

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.125
DIFFICULT TIME AND EVEN BEFORE

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:09.727
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:11.729
FORMULA IT WOULD BE RELATED TO

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:13.497
TITLE ONE FUNDS LIKE WHY DOES

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:15.166
THAT SCHOOL GET TITLE ONE

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:18.169
FUNDS. AND WE DON'T SO AT THE

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:21.005
VERY BASIC LEVEL PERRANCE MANY

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.773
TIMES ADMINISTRATORS AND

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.241
TEACHERS FEEL THAT THAT'S

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:26.577
UNFAIR BUT WHEN WE ADDED THE

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:28.579
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.214
THAT IT WAS OKAY WE GET THIS

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:31.582
MUCH MONEY AND THE FIRST THING

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:33.284
WE HEARD FROM MANY DISTRICTS

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:35.286
WAS. WAIT THE NUMBERS ARE WRONG

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:36.654
WE SHOULD BE GETTING MORE

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:39.090
BECAUSE WE HAVE. MORE STUDENTS

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:41.626
A AND IT'S NOT FAIR BUT THEN

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:43.394
ONCE THE MONEY WAS STARTING TO

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:45.463
BE USED. IT WAS WELL OVER GET

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:46.864
X. AMOUNT OF MONEY IF WE PUT A

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.766
READING SPECIALIST AT EVERY

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:51.102
SCHOOL THAT EVERYBODY GETS TO

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:53.304
HAVE THAT READING SPECIALISTS

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:56.007
AND THAT'S EQUAL RIGHT. BUT THE

00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:58.209
TRUTH IS SOME SCHOOLS NEED

00:37:58.275 --> 00:37:58.676
THREE OR FOUR READING

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:01.045
INTERVENTION SPECIALIST BECAUSE

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:03.014
THEY HAVE THE HIGH NUMBER OF

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.783
STUDENTS IN THAT. CATEGORY AND

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.451
OTHER SCHOOLS MAY NEED ONE OR

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:10.321
NOT EVEN ONE BUT DISTRICTS AND

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:11.589
ADMINISTRATORS AND

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.090
SUPERINTENDENTS ARE HAVING A

00:38:13.157 --> 00:38:15.159
VERY HARD TIME MAKING THAT

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:16.961
DECISION BECAUSE IT SEEMS ON

00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:21.365
EQUAL. AND THE TRUTH IS YES IF

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:23.467
STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR THOSE

00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:25.803
FUNDS THEY SHOULD GET MORE. AND

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.405
THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE THIS

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:29.707
EQUITY ANY QUALITY ISSUE AND IT

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:32.376
JUST HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WELL

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:34.478
WE'RE HIRING A P. ET COACH THIS

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:36.580
ISGOOD FOR EVERYBODY. BUT

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.349
THOSE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:39.450
INCREASE THE ACADEMIC

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:43.220
ACHIEVEMENT OF THOSE SUBGROUPS

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:45.556
AND THAT'S WHY I. ASK THE

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:46.657
AUDITOR ALONG WITH MY

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:50.294
COLLEAGUE- THAT I WANTED TO SEE

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:51.729
HOW THESE FUNDS WERE BEING USED

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.831
I CAN GIVE MANY EXAMPLES WHERE

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:54.999
THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:57.368
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. BUT IS IT

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:00.104
CHANGING HOW THE STUDENTS IN

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:02.339
THESE CATEGORIES ARE ACHIEVING

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.075
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT. I'M

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:06.110
NOT SAYING THAT GROWTH YES WE

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.045
SEE SOME OF OUR ACHIEVEMENT

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:09.213
MOVE UP AND THEN WE SEE THE

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.716
OTHER STUDENTS MOVE UP AS WELL

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:13.217
SO WE'RE NOT CLOSING THAT SOME

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:15.252
PEOPLE HAVE EVEN GONE AS FAR.

00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:17.321
AS SAYING TO ME WE'RE NEVER

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:19.056
GONNA CHANGE CLOSE IT. WE JUST

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:21.692
HOW CAN WAY. AND TO ME THAT'S

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.427
NOT ACCEPTABLE SO I LOOK

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:24.929
FORWARD TO THE HEARINGAND A

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:28.466

THIS THIS AUDIT HAPPEN I THINK

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:44.448
IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL. WHEN WE- I

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:46.650

TITLE ONE IN IN THE EDUCATION

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:57.661
PROCESS BUT I'M STILL VERY MUCH

00:39:57.728 --> 00:40:00.264
NO IN THE LEARNING PHASE. I DO

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:02.800
WANT TO- JUST MAKE A COMMENT

SCHOOLS ARE AUDITED OR AS THE

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.110
PROCESS MOVES FORWARD- THAT.

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:15.012
THE REPORT AS IT COMES OUT

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:17.681
POINT IN I. IDENTIFY THAT WALL

SCHOOLS MAY HAVE BEEN PICKED.

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:21.886
SPECIFIC REASONS. ARE THERE

00:40:21.952 --> 00:40:24.755
PRACTICES COULD VERY WELL BE ON

UTILIZED BY OTHER DISTRICT

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:31.796

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:39.383
OF THESE. IN. THREE KEY ISSUE

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.218
AREAS THE FIRST IS RELATED TO

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:43.620
FUNDING- AND AS SOME OF THE

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:46.056
OPENING COMMENTS. MENTIONED ARE

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:47.157
THE CONCLUSIONS IN THE REPORT

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.993
IS THAT THE STATE HAS NOT

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:50.060
INSURED THAT DISTRICTS ARE

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:51.662
SPENDING SUPPLEMENTAL IN

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.597
CONCENTRATION FUNDS THOSE FUNDS

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.532
THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:58.202
TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THOSE

00:43:58.268 --> 00:43:59.937
AS WE REFER TO THEM INTENDED

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.005
STUDENTS ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.873
LEARNERS YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.576
AND INDIVIDUALS FROM HOUSE WITH

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:07.244
LOW INCOME SO THOSE THREE

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.179
GROUPS. IS REALLY WHAT THE

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.748
SUPPLEMENT CONCERT CAN FUNDING

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:14.585
WAS PRIMARILY ALLOCATED FOR AN

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:15.786
AND THE STATE IS NOT ENSURING

00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:17.755
THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:19.356
FOR THOSE STUDENTS AND SO THOSE

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:21.091
STUDENTS ARE NOT BENEFITING

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:23.227
FROM THAT MONEY. AND THE SECOND

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:26.697
AREA I THOUGHT THE ALL CAPS THE

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:31.568
LOCAL CONTROL AND DANCE. AND

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:35.072
WHEN WE- THOSE. AT THE- IS THE

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:36.540
PLANS ARE NOT PROVIDING THE AND

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:37.775
ABILITY TO CALL CAN. TO STAKE.

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:39.510
PARENTS ARE IN THE COMMUNITY

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:40.778
PARENTS OF STUDENTS GOING TO

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.046
THOSE PARTICULAR SCHOOLS HOW

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:43.547
EFFECTIVELY THOSE DISTRICTS ARE

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:45.115
PROVIDING SERVICES TO THOSE

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:47.117
INTENDED STUDENTS. AND THEN THE

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.486
THIRD MAJOR CATEGORIES OUTCOMES

00:44:49.553 --> 00:44:51.488
WE CERTAINLY AS A STATE WANT TO

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:54.391
BE ABLE TO TIE FUNDING TO

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:56.693
OUTCOMES AND AS MS QUIRK SILVA

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.528
TRY TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT

00:44:57.594 --> 00:44:59.263
GAP AND- INCREASE THE

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.365
ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE THESE

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:02.666
PARTICULAR STUDENTS. AND

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:04.334
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE FOUND IS

00:45:04.401 --> 00:45:05.769
THERE IS THERE ISN'T A LINK

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:07.071
BETWEEN THERE ISN'T A DIRECT

00:45:07.137 --> 00:45:08.572
LINK BETWEEN THE FUNDING THAT

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.574
IS BEING PROVIDED TO THE

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:11.442
DISTRICTS. AND THE DASHBOARD

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:12.743
THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.111
EDUCATION LAUNCH JUST A FEW

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:16.346
YEARS AGO. SO THOSE ARE THE

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:18.115
THREE BIG BIG BUCKETS THAT

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:19.483
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY I

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.584
WILL STEP YOU THROUGH VERY

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:22.619
QUICKLY AT A HIGH LEVEL IS A

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:24.054
AND THE INTEREST OF TIME I WANT

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.122
TO MAKE SURE THAT. CAN GET TO

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:27.591
THE HAND. BUT I'M FUNDING THEY

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:30.394
SAID STATE DOES X. REQUIRE

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:31.829
DISTRICTS TO SPEND THEIR ALL OF

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:32.396
THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:34.331
CONCENTRATION FUNDING FOR THESE

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.866
INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS.

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:37.768
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFY

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:40.204
IS IF A DISTRICT DOESN'T SPEND

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:41.705
ALL THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL IN

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:42.639
CONCENTRATION FUNDING IN ONE

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:45.008
YEAR. IN THE NEXT YEAR. OF THE

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.710
DEATHS WERE YOU DOING THAT AS

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:48.112
BASE FOR IT DID NOT MAINTAIN

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:50.547
ITS ITS IDENTITY. AS

00:45:50.614 --> 00:45:52.049
SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:53.350
FUNDING SO WE HAD CONCERT WITH

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:54.351
THAT AND MADE SOME

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.752
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.921
SUBSTANTIALLY AS WE CONCLUDE

00:45:57.988 --> 00:45:59.590
AND REPORT WITH THE STATE HAS

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:00.757
CREATED A MECHANISM PROVIDE

00:46:00.824 --> 00:46:02.893
ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.662
DEEPENS. BUT NOT A CAN IS TO BE

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:06.597
ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:08.232
NOT THAT FUNDING IS ACTIVE IS

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:14.972
BE USED BRIT. AND IS A FOR IN.

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:18.542
PORT AU SO THE KIDS. YOU KNOW.

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:21.044
BUT SHE AB IN THEIR CHIEF LEVEL.

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.179
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE EL CAPS.

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:23.480
WITH RESPECT TO FUNDING WHY WE

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:25.149
SAT FOUND IS BUT IN THE- IN

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:26.517
FOR. RELATED TO SUPPLEMENTAL

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.218
CONCENTRATION FUNDS WAS NOT

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:30.020
ALWAYS TRANSPARENT. WHAT ARE

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:32.222
STAFF AND JORDAN WILL TALK TO

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:33.423
ABOUT THIS LITTLE BIT IS WE

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:34.424
ACTUALLY HAD TO GO INTO THOSE

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:36.560
ALL CAPS. AND LOOK IN VARIOUS

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.562
AREAS OF THESE VOLUMINOUS L.

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.797
CAPS HUNDREDS OF PAGES TO FIND

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.366
ALL OF THE BUDGET INFORMATION

00:46:42.432 --> 00:46:43.300
ALL OF THE EXPENDITURE

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:44.468
INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO COME

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:45.903
UP WITH A SUMMARY. OF

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:47.237
SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:49.373
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT ALL SPENT

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:51.508
WHAT WAS IT SPENT ON. AND WE

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:53.944
HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:56.213
REPORT AGAIN RELATED TO MORE

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.748
TRANSPARENCY AND MAKING THOSE

00:46:57.814 --> 00:47:00.851
EL CAPS MORE STREAMLINED. AND

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.386
ALLOWING PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO

00:47:02.452 --> 00:47:04.588
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS BUDGET WHAT

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.156
WAS SPENT IS THERE MONEY LEFT

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:07.891
OVER AND BEING ABLE TO HOLD

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:09.626
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:12.129
FOR USING THAT MONEY IN THE

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:13.297
FIVE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. FOR THE

00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:18.235
INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. SO

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:18.835
THOSE ARE THE ARE SOME OF THE

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:21.838
ISSUE RELATED TO FUND. THE

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:22.439
LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:24.141
THE L. CAPS A OUR OUR PRIMER

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:25.609
CONCLUDE ON THIS IS THE

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.544
INFORMATION IN THESE CAL CAPS

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:29.846
IT'S OVERLY COMPLEX ON THESE EL

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:31.381
CAPS ARE LONG THE LUMINOUS

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:33.417
DOCUMENTS THEY REALLY NEED TO

00:47:33.483 --> 00:47:35.552
BE STREAMLINED- AND WHAT WE

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.020
FOUND IS THERE WERE THERE WERE

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:38.622
A VARIETY OF GOALS AND THE ALL

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.524
CAPS AND THEN. NUMEROUS

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:42.359
SERVICES. UNDERNEATH THOSE

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:43.827
PARTICULAR GOALS BUT WE WEREN'T

00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:46.530
SEEING A LINK BETWEEN THAT AND

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:48.131
THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURE SO IT'S

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:50.834
REALLY OBSCURING. THE ABILITY

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:52.569
REALLY MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.371
STAKEHOLDERS OR ANYONE TO

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:56.073
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT A

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.407
SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DOING AND

00:47:57.474 --> 00:47:59.576
BEING ABLE TO HOLD THAT SCHOOL

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:02.446
DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE TO PROPER

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:04.481
USE OF THOSE FUNDS. SO WE HAD

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:06.650
SOME SOME RECOMMENDATIONS WITH

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:07.918
RESPECT TO THAT ARE CERTAINLY

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:09.886
WE ARE UNDER IN THE STATE BOARD

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:11.822
OF EDUCATION WORKING ON STREAM

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:14.625
AND DO SOME. RISE OF THE EL CAP

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:15.359
AND WE THINK THAT STEP IN THE

00:48:15.425 --> 00:48:16.693
RIGHT DIRECTORY BUT WE ALSO

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.928
THINK THAT THERE ARE MORE NEEDS

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:19.596
TO BE DONE WITH RESPECT TO THAT

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:21.732
SO I'M GONNA STOP THEIR STARS

00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:23.467
THE ALL CAPS AND LET AGAIN

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:25.636
JORDAN TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:28.905
BIT. AND THEN OUT COMES WE WERE

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.274
REALLY LOOKING FOR LET. PAINT

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.611
AND TING THE L. CAP NO THAT FOR

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:36.647
THERE IS A AN ACT IS NOT THANK

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:44.554
BETWEEN. MY DISTRICT IS. THERE

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.622
AND SINGLE MONIES IN AND IS

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:47.224
THAT ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE AN

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.859
OUTCOME. SO FOR A- IF A- YOU

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:49.793
RECEIVED AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.628
A SLANG LEARNERS. AND THEY HIRE.

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:52.562
AND THAT'S SERVICE THAT THE PER.

00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:53.297
TO THOSE STUDENTS WE YOU GET TO

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:54.631
THE DASH. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:56.800
BE ABLE TO TELL. THE FUNDING

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:59.069
THAT THAT DISTRICT SPENT ON

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:02.439
THOSE TUTORS. SUCH RESULTED IN

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:03.640
INCREASED ACHIEVEMENT FOR

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:04.574
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.810
BECAUSE IT GETS. IT GETS ROLLED

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:08.679
UP INTO AN OVERALL GOAL SO IT'S

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:11.214
NOT SPECIFIC TO THAT SERVICE OR

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:12.582
THAT PARTICULAR TUTOR AND WE

00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:13.617
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:15.852
DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN. WHAT

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:18.322
ARE WE SPENDING THE MONEY AT

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:18.955
THE DISTRICT SPENDING THE MONEY

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:21.058
ON. AND WHAT ULTIMATELY IS THE

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.826
OUTCOME SO YOU CAN MEASURE OVER

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.861
TIME NOW THE DASHBOARD WAS

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:26.596
LAUNCHED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:49:26.663 --> 00:49:27.998
LCF IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR LONGER

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.633
THAN THAT START IN FISCAL YEAR

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.901
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. SO WE ONLY

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:33.070
HAVE AS A STATE A COUPLE OF

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:35.372
YEARS OF INFORMATION BUT WE

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:36.406
CERTAINLY BELIEVE THERE'S AN

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:38.408
OPPORTUNE TIME NOW. TO MAKE

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:40.377
SOME CHANGES TO THE

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:42.212
REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW.

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:43.780
STAKEHOLDERS THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:45.382
THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.150
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MONEY IS

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:49.386
BEING INVESTED AND IS IT TRULY

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:51.054
BENEFITING THE STUDENTS THESE

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:53.023
INTENDED STUDENTS. ARE AND IS

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.791
IT RESULTING IN OUTCOMES THAT

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:56.727
ARE SHOWING IMPROVEMENT AND

00:49:56.793 --> 00:50:00.731
pACHIEVEMENT GAP SO WE NEED TO

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:01.665
SEE AN ALIGNMENT BETWEEN

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.734
EXPENDITURES AND OUTCOMES AND

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.402
WITH THAT THAT DOES NOT EXIST

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:06.703
RIGHT NOW WE THINK THERE IS A

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:07.938
SOLUTION. WE THINK IT'S A

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:10.507
FEASIBLE REASONABLE SOLUTION-

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:12.376
TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE- AND

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:13.377
AGAIN AS WE CONCLUDE IN THE

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:14.711
REPORT WE THINK NOW THE

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:16.913
OPPORTUNE TIME. TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.148
ACCOMPLISH THAT SO WITH THAT

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:19.683
MEMBERS I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:20.617
TO MISTER RIGHT AND HERE HE

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.018
WILL STEP YOU THROUGH THE HAND

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.687
OUT WHICH WILL BASICALLY. EL

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.422
HELP LAPERRIERE'S SOME OF THE

00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:28.325
THESE THREE KEY ISSUES THAT I

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:30.727
DE IDENTIFIED. PLEASE MR IT

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:31.862
GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR

00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:33.130
MEMBERS MY NAME IS JORDAN RIGHT

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:34.498
I'M A SENIOR AUDITOR WITH THE

00:50:34.564 --> 00:50:35.265
STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND I

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:36.566
WAS THE TEAM LEAD FOR THIS

00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:38.502
AUDIT OF. THE LOCAL CONTROL

00:50:38.568 --> 00:50:40.370
FUNDING FORMULA. I WOULD LIKE

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:41.705
TO BEGIN JUST BY SHARING SOME

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:43.340
BRIEF BACKGROUND INFORMATION

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:44.474
SOME OF IT'S BEEN TOUCHED UPON

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:46.143
ALREADY AND THEN. HAS THE STATE

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:47.611
AUDITOR SETTLE TALK THROUGH

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:49.813
THOSE THREE FINDING AREAS. SO

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.783
TO BEGIN WITH IN FISCAL YEAR

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:53.383
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.218
THE STATE SHIFTED FROM THE

00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:56.620
CATEGORICAL APPROACH IT

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.488
PREVIOUSLY USED TO THE TO THE-

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:00.490
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:01.858
AGAIN THE INTENT BEING TO

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:03.427
PROVIDE THAT LOCAL CONTROL

00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:05.629
DISTRICTS BUT ALSO TO REDUCE

00:51:05.695 --> 00:51:07.097
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT EXIST.

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.899
NOW WITH THOSE- INTENDED

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:10.867
STUDENT GROUPS. ON PAGE ONE OF

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:12.169
THE HANDOUT WE SHOW THE

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:15.705
ELEMENTS OF THE- HEALTHY FF.

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.741
BASED FUNDS WHICH AGAIN FOR ANY

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:18.942
EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE AND THEN

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:19.643
THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:22.112
CONCENTRATION FUNDS. THAT ARE.

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.580
TO BE USED TO INCREASE OUR

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:25.182
IMPROVE SERVICES. FOR THOSE

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:26.817
INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS WE ALSO

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:28.485
PROVIDE THERE AT THE BOTTOM A

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:30.020
HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF HOW

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:32.088
THAT CALCULATION ACTUALLY

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:33.690
WORKS- WHAT I WOULD NOTE IS

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.592
THAT. DURING THE PERIOD OF OUR

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:36.960
AUDIT AND REALLY UP UNTIL THIS

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:39.196
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:40.430
CALCULATION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

00:51:40.497 --> 00:51:42.232
PROVIDING A TARGET AMOUNT IT'S

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.567
NOT BEEN THE ACTUAL FUNDING

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:45.168
THAT DISTRICTS RECEIVE AN-

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.070
THERE'S BEEN A PHASE IN PERIOD

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:48.939
WHILE THE LCF WAS NOT FULLY

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:50.474
FUNDED. AT THE BEGINNING AS

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.542
IT'S GROWN ON THE STATE IS

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:55.011
ADDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:56.713
FULLY FUND IT. THE STATE WAS

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.282
USING A OF IN A- IT'S IMPORTANT

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:00.317
TO NOTE THAT THAT PHASE IN

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:02.819
APPROACH IDENTIFIED A TOTAL

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:04.654
AMOUNT OF LC FF. THE DISTRICT

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:06.056
WOULD RECEIVE IT DID NOT

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:08.358
IDENTIFY HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:09.025
BE SUPPLEMENTAL IN

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:11.261
CONCENTRATION. SO AS A RESULT

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:12.429
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:13.864
HAD TO ADOPT SOME REGULATIONS

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.699
THAT WOULD INSTRUCT DISTRICTS.

00:52:15.765 --> 00:52:17.234
IN HOW TO IDENTIFY AND

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.502
DETERMINE HOW MUCH WAS-

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:20.637
SUPPLEMENT ONE CONCENTRATION

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:22.372
FUNDING. ON PAGE TWO WHAT WE

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:25.475
SHOW. IS SOME OF THE IMPACT IN

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:26.543
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.111
APPROACH THAT THE STATE BOARD

00:52:28.178 --> 00:52:29.746
TOOK. AND ULTIMATELY WE FOUND

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.214
THAT THOSE REGULATIONS THEY

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:32.983
TOOK AN APPROACH OF BASING

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:34.584
SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:35.519
FUNDING ON PRIOR YOU'RE

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.354
SPENDING. RATHER THAN ON THE

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.322
POPULATION OF INTENDED STUDENT

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.790
GROUPS AND THAT RESULTED IN

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.626
DISTRICTS IDENTIFYING LESS OF

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.194
THEIR HEALTHY F. F. AS

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:46.029
SUPPLEMENT ONE CONCENTRATION.

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:46.897
THAN THEY WOULD HAVE IF THEY

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:48.298
HAD FOLLOWED MORE CLOSELY THOSE

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:50.300
PROPORTIONS THAT EXIST. IN THE

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:52.202
FORMULA ITSELF SO THE

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.204
HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE SHOWS YOU.

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:56.039
THE TARGET AMOUNT- FOR A

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:57.207
HYPOTHETICAL TWO HUNDRED

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:58.875
MILLION IN THAT FIRST BY THE

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:00.844
SECOND BAR IS SHOWING WHAT

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.245
WOULD HAVE RESULTED IF THE

00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:03.880
STATE BAR THERE THE STATE BOARD

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.615
HAD TAKEN AN APPROACH THAT MORE

00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:06.449
CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THOSE

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.517
PROPORTIONS YOU CAN SEE THE

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:09.586
TWENTY. PERCENT IN SUPPLEMENTAL

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:11.955
CONCENTRATION AND 80% AND THEN

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:13.990
THE LAST BARS SHOWING WHAT THE

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:14.424
STATE BOARD ACTUALLY

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:16.860
IMPLEMENTED- AND YOU CAN SEE

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:17.827
THE DIFFERENCE THERE IN THE

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:19.362
AMOUNTS OF SUPPLEMENT ONE

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:21.398
CONCENTRATION. AT THE BOTTOM OF

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:23.266
THAT FIGURE WHAT YOU CAN SEE

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:25.201
IS. AGAIN THE LIGHT YELLOW ON

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:26.970
THE BOTTOM BUT DISTRICT

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:28.471
ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED USING THOSE

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:31.608
REGULATIONS SO THEY FOLLOW THE

00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:33.543
REGULATIONS. AND THE IDENTIFIED

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.212
A MOUNTAIN FUNDING AS- WOMEN

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:38.281
CONCENTRATION THE- HOWEVER. IS

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:39.749
GOING AGAIN FOR OUR THREE. THE

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:41.718
M. THAT. WOULD HAVE BEEN I. IF

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:44.387
THEY HAD IF THE STATE HAD USE

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:46.022
REGULATIONS THAT MORE CLOSELY

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:48.158
ALIGNED WITH THOSE. PROPORTIONS

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:54.397
THAT EXIST IN STATE LAW.

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.765
JENNIFER A THREE HUNDRED AND

00:53:55.832 --> 00:53:57.033
TWENTY DOLLARS OVER THAT FIVE

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.336
YEAR PERIOD. AND THAT IS

00:53:59.402 --> 00:54:01.471
BECAUSE I DE OR IT SHOWS THAT

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:02.639
BY DEFERRING THAT

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:04.174
IMPLEMENTATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.508
IN CONCENTRATION AND ALLOWING

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.944
DISTRICTS TO BASE IT ON PRIOR

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:12.082
YOU'RE SPENDING. THERE'S BEEN A-DELAY ULTIMATELY IN THE FUNDING

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:12.882
THAT WAS SPENT FOR THOSE

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:14.317
INTENDED STUDENTS AND LIKELY

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.485
THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.554
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES SO WE

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:20.657
PROVIDE THIS REALLY AS- AN

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:23.126
EXPECTATIONS SETTING THAT THAT

00:54:23.193 --> 00:54:25.128
PERHAPS NOT AS MUCH PROGRESS

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:26.329
HAS BEEN MADE AS MIGHT BE

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:28.865
EXPECTED. I WILL KNOW THAT NOW

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:31.434
THE HEALTHY FF IS FULLY FUNDED

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:34.137
THE FORMULA IS NOW IDENTIFYING

00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:35.739
ACTUAL FUNDING AND SO THE

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:37.040
REGULATIONS THAT THE STATE

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:39.442
BOARD HAD ADOPTED ARE NO LONGER

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.411
IN PLAY SO THIS IS A HISTORICAL

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:43.113
PROBLEM THAT NO LONGER. NO

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:46.016
LONGER EXISTS. MOVING TO PAGE

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:47.584
THREE- AT THE STATE AUDITOR

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.352
SAID- THE FIRST FINDING WAS

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:50.620
REALLY THAT THE DISTRICTS HAVE

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:51.955
AN INSURED IN THE STATES

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:54.224
APPROACH HAS AN INSURER. THE

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.226
DISTRICTS SPEND ABOUT FUNDING-

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:57.661
ON SERVICES FOR THE INTENDED

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.663
STUDENT GROUPS. AND THEY'RE

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:00.630
REALLY THREE POINTS THAT I WANT

00:55:00.697 --> 00:55:01.965
TO MENTION AS HAS BEEN

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:03.566
MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE STATE

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:05.001
LAW DOESN'T EXPRESSLY REQUIRE

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:07.037
THOSE FUNDS TO BE SPENT AND AS

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:08.972
A RESULT ANY UNSPENT FUNDS CAN

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:10.473
BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE IN THE

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.076
FOLLOWING YEAR. THE NEXT POINT

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.344
STATE LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT

00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:16.012
DISTRICTS TRACK THIS FUNDING.

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.313
IN THEIR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.982
THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:20.650
IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT ANY

00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:22.552
UNDER SPENDING OCCURRED. IN

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:25.121
FACT THE EL CAP AND AS THE

00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:25.789
STATE AUDITOR MENTION THESE

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:28.124
NUMEROUS. VOLUMINOUS DOCUMENTS

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:29.459
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT YOU

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:31.294
CAN FIND THAT INFORMATION. AND

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:33.697
SO WHAT WE DID IS WE REVIEWED

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:34.230
FOR ON THE THREE SELECTED

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.632
DISTRICTS AND THEIR BUDGETED

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:37.867
AND ACTUAL EXPENDITURES IN

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:40.570
THOSE DOCUMENTS. WE FOUND THAT.

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:42.205
THE TWO OF THE DISTRICTS

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:44.808
ACTUALLY UNDER SPENT. THERE

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.676
SUPPLEMENT ON CONCENTRATION BY

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:48.478
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ULTIMATELY

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:51.081
WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:52.148
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD AMEND

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:53.850
STATE LAW AND REQUIRED

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:55.552
DISTRICTS TO ANNUALLY RECONCILE

00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:57.020
THESE AMOUNTS HOW MUCH DID YOU

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:58.254
RECEIVE HOW MUCH DID YOU

00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.489
BUDGET. AND HOW MUCH DID YOU

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.858
ACTUALLY SPEND TO IDENTIFY THAT

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:04.060
ON SPENT FUNDING. AND ANY OF

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.095
THE UNSPENT FUNDING WE WOULD

00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:07.497
EXPECT THAT IT BE CARRIED OVER

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:10.200
INTO FUTURE YEARS AND TO BE

00:56:10.266 --> 00:56:10.767
USED FOR THE PURPOSE THAT IT

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:13.169
WAS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR. I

00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:14.304
WILL NOTE THAT THE STATE. THE

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.773
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.441
MADE SOME CHANGES TO ITS-

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:21.177
TEMPLATE IT'S ALSO IMPLEMENTED.

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:22.679
A BUDGET OVERVIEW FOR PARENTS

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:25.648
AS PART OF THE EL CAP DOCUMENT.

00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:27.350
AND TO THOSE CHANGES THAT

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:28.518
THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED HAVE

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:30.186
INTRODUCED SOME ADDITIONAL

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:31.621
INFORMATION BUT IT DOES NOT.

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:33.523
RESOLVE OUR CONCERN ABOUT

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.792
RECONCILING IN CARRYING THOSE

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:40.530
FUNDS OVER. ON THE NEXT PAGE

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:41.898
GETS INTO OUR SECOND FINDING

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.533
WHICH IS RELATED TO THE TO THE

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:47.103
L. CAPS. WE FOUND THEY DON'T

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:47.604
CONSISTENTLY PROVIDE THE

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.572
TRANSPARENCY THAT WE WOULD

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:52.008
EXPECT. DISTRICTS HAVE THE

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.576
ABILITY TO SPEND SUPPLEMENTAL

00:56:53.643 --> 00:56:55.712
IN CONCENTRATION FUNDS FOR

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:56.880
DISTRICT WIDE PURPOSES

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:58.148
ESSENTIALLY THINGS THAT WOULD

00:56:58.214 --> 00:56:59.916
BENEFIT ADDITIONAL STUDENTS

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:00.750
BEYOND JUST THE INTENDED

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:02.552
STUDENT GROUPS BUT WHEN THEY DO

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:03.553
THAT THE REQUIRED TO

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.955
DEMONSTRATE IN THE EL CAP THAT

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.357
THOSE FUNDS ARE PRINCIPALLY

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:08.992
DIRECTED TOWARD THE INTENDED

00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:11.127
STUDENT GROUPS. WE FOUND THAT

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:13.363
THEY DON'T ALWAYS CLEARLY

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:14.798
DESCRIBE THAT IN THE EL CAP.

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:16.566
ACT THIRTY SEVEN OF THE FIFTY

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:17.367
THREE EXPENDITURES THAT WE

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:19.002
LOOKED AT WERE UNCLEAR TO US WE

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.570
COULDN'T DETERMINE WHETHER

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:22.405
THOSE ARE PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED.

00:57:22.472 --> 00:57:24.407
ADDITIONALLY WE FOUND THAT SOME

00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:25.441
STAKEHOLDERS HAD SUBMITTED

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:27.143
CLICK COMPLAINTS TO DISTRICTS

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.145
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:31.748
CD E. HAD HAD RULED ON THOSE

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:33.316
COMPLAINTS AND ACTUALLY FOUND

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:35.552
SEVERAL THINGS- BULL FROM

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.153
PITFALLS AND SOME BEST

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.556
PRACTICES. CONSISTENT AMONG

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:42.826
THOSE AMONG THOSE- RESPONSES

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.527
THAT THEY PROVIDED. ULTIMATELY

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:45.762
WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION TO

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.263
THE STATE BOARD THAT THEY

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:48.765
SHOULD INCLUDE THAT INFORMATION

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.533
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PITFALLS

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.435
IN ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICES. IN

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:53.870
THE EL CAP TEMPLATE SO THAT

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:55.238
DISTRICTS KNOW IT AND CAN

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:56.806
EITHER AVOID IT OR MAKE SURE

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:58.708
THAT THEY DO IT AND ALSO ALLOWS

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:01.344
THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:02.412
TO HOLD DISTRICTS FEET TO THE

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:05.682
FIRE- TO NOT FALL INTO THOSE

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:07.150
THE SAME PITFALLS. THE SECOND

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:08.685
POINT THAT I WANT TO MENTION

00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:10.353
THERE IS REALLY THAT THEY THE

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.788
INFORMATION RE REVIEWED IN EL

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:13.189
CAPS DIDN'T REALLY COME CLEARLY

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:16.226
COMMUNICATE. HOW THEY WERE

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:17.594
EFFECTIVELY MEETING STUDENTS

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.395
NEEDS- AS THE STATE AUDITOR

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:21.297
MENTION THE GOALS ARE VERY

00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:22.498
BROAD THERE ARE NUMEROUS

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:26.035
SERVICES. AND THE ANALYSIS THAT

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.270
DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING OUR AN

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:28.638
OVERALL ANALYSIS THEY'RE NOT

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:30.240
LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE

00:58:30.306 --> 00:58:31.774
INDIVIDUAL SERVICES.

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:34.777
ADDITIONALLY 60% OF THE OUTCOME

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:36.212
DATA THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:37.080
THREE DISTRICTS ALL CAPS THAT

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:38.848
WE REVIEWED WAS EITHER PENDING

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.617
OR IT WAS LAST YEAR'S DATA SO

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:41.851
AGAIN IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HELPING

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:43.286
YOU TO KNOW IF WHAT WHAT

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.455
THEY'RE DOING THIS YEAR. IS

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:47.123
RESULTING IN IN PROGRESS. AND

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.259
THEN LASTLY THE LENGTH IN THE

00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:51.060
COMPLEXITY OF THE L. CAPS-

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:53.830
HUNDREDS OF PAGES LONG AND

00:58:53.897 --> 00:58:55.531
COMPLEX DOCUMENTS. WE MADE

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.300
RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN TO THE

00:58:57.367 --> 00:59:00.036
STATE BOARD THAT THEY ADOPT A

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:02.405
TEMPLATE THAT HELPS TO REDUCE

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:04.240
SOME OF THE- DUPLICATION THAT

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:05.375
OCCURS IN THE DOCUMENT BECAUSE

00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:08.478
OF. REPETITION WHEN THEY'RE

00:59:08.544 --> 00:59:10.213
PROVIDING ANNUAL UPDATES- WE

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.214
RECEIVED THEIR RESPONSE AND

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:12.949
REVIEWING IT HELLO GONNA HAVE

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:13.683
SOME IT IN A FOLLOW UP

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.084
QUESTIONS FOR THE STATE BOARD

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:20.556
ON THAT. ON THAT SCORE. ON THE

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:21.124
LAST FIND THAT I WANTED TO

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.525
ABOUT THEM IS AGAIN RELATED TO

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:24.460
THE OUTCOME. AS WE LOOKED AT

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:26.162
THE DASHBOARD DATA FOR THE

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.664
THREE DISTRICTS. WE DID SEE

00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:29.465
MONSTER PRUDENCE AT THE TIME WE

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:31.367
ONLY HAD TWO DATA POINTS REALLY

00:59:31.434 --> 00:59:33.403
TWO YEARS OF DATA. AND THAT WE

00:59:33.469 --> 00:59:36.339
ALSO NOTED THAT. OVER TIME.

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:37.407
CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:38.841
TESTS THAT ARE BEING USED IN

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:39.943
THERE'S BEEN CHANGES TO THE

00:59:40.009 --> 00:59:41.411
DASHBOARD INDICATORS

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:43.713
ALTERNATELY FOUND THAT THEY

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.382
CHEAPENED GAPS PERSIST- AND- WE

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:48.518
FOUND. POLICYMAKERS REALLY LACK

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:49.652
ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.287
DETERMINE WHETHER THE FUNDING

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:53.389
THAT'S BEING USED IS HELPING TO

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:55.224
INCREASE INTENDED STUDENT

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:57.460
GROUPS HI PERFORMANCE. AND TO

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:58.928
REDUCE THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS.

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.663
AS WE POINT OUT IN IN THE

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.999
FIGURE ON PAGE FIVE. THERE'S NO

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:05.101
CONNECTION BETWEEN EL CAPS AND

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.569
THEIR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS. AND

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.004
THEY DON'T TRACK INFORMATION IN

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:09.405
A WAY THAT ALIGNS WITH THE

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:11.774
DASHBOARD SO YOU CAN NEVER SEE

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:13.643
PROGRESS IN THE DASHBOARD AND

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:14.944
BACK AND BACK TO WORK WITH. ON

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:16.913
TO HELP TO ACHIEVE THAT

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:20.116
PROGRESS IF YOUR SEEN. WHAT'S

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.818
BEING DONE THAT SEEMS IN FACT

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:22.318
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SEEN

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.020
PROGRESS. ULTIMATELY WITH TO

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:25.788
ADDRESS THE GAP BETWEEN FUNDING

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:27.824
AND OUT COMES THE STATE COULD

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.125
AND SHOULD COLLECTED DIGITAL

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:31.160
INFORMATION. AND WE PROVIDE AN

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:32.328
EXAMPLE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:35.999
STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED IF

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:38.301
YOU'RE IF YOU'RE- PAYING FOR

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:39.435
ENGLISH. TUTOR YOU SHOULD BE

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:40.770
CAP A AND- IN ACCOUNTING SYSTEM

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:41.971
SO YOU CAN TRACK THOSE

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:43.539
EXPENDITURES. AND THEN THE

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:45.641
STATE OTHER POLICY MAKERS. CAN

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:47.443
COMPARE YOUR SPENDING WITH

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.811
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:51.247
DASHBOARD. SO WE MADE THE

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.615
RECOMMENDATION WE BELIEVE

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:54.217
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP TO

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:55.651
UNDERSTANDING HOW BILLIONS OF

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:57.153
DOLLARS ARE ARE IMPACTING

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.088
STUDENTS LIVES. AND SO WE MADE

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:00.690
THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:03.726
STATE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:04.327
TRACKING MECHANISM TO ACHIEVE

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:07.797
THIS. WE DO NOTE THAT IN THE

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:09.165
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HE HAS

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:11.534
INCLUDED SOME FUNDING TO

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:14.170
IMPLEMENT WHAT HE TERMS AND EL

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.706
CAP PORTAL- IT SEEMS TO BE

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.141
DIRECTED AT THIS IDEA OF BEING

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.942
ABLE TO LINK OUT WHAT YOU'RE

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.911
SPENDING WITH WITH- WHAT'S

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:24.147
HAPPENING ON THE DASHBOARD. IT

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.715
DOESN'T ACHIEVE AS FAR AS WE

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:27.383
CAN SEE RIGHT NOW THE CONCERN

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:28.751
THAT WE HAVE ABOUT CONNECTING

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.486
THE EL CAP WITH THE ACCOUNTING

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:32.555
SYSTEM SO THAT YOU HAVE LINKAGE

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:35.124
THERE. WE IN THE REPORT PUT

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:37.060
FORTH THE A POSSIBILITY OF

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.429
ADJUSTING THE STATE ACCOUNTING

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:42.098
CODE STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS TO

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:45.234
ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE. SOME

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.203
ULTIMATELY AN- CITY AND THE

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.704
STATE BOARD- EXPRESSED SOME

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.373
CONCERNS ABOUT. PERHAPS

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.774
RETURNING TO A CATEGORICAL

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:54.577
APPROACH- WE DISAGREE WITH THAT

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.079
PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'RE

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:58.281
RECOMMENDING IS. IMPLEMENTING

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:00.216
AN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY WHAT

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:01.551
DISTRICTS SPENT THEIR FUNDING

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:02.785
ON AFTER THEY'VE MADE THE

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:04.554
DECISION IT WOULDN'T IMPINGE ON

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.556
THE DISTRICT'S ABILITY. TO

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.390
EXERCISE ITS LOCAL CONTROL TO

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:09.292
CHOOSE OUT WANTS TO SPEND ITS

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.560
MONEY IT JUST INFORM

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:12.195
STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT CHOICE

01:02:12.261 --> 01:02:13.963
WAS. AND ALLOWS THEM TO THEN

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.664
COMPARE WITH OUTCOMES THAT

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:17.467
THEY'RE SEEING IN THE DASHBOARD

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.734
ON THE LAST PAGE WE IN SOME OF

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:22.071
THE- WEALTH ISSUES AND THE

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.539
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE INTENDED

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.508
RESULTS ULTIMATELY. WE BELIEVE

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.210
THAT BY IMPLEMENTING THESE

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.144
LEGEND LEGISLATIVE

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:29.579
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE STATE

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:30.947
BETTER INSURERS THAT

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:32.515
SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.383
FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY BENEFITING

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.718
THOSE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS.

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:38.121
OUT WITH THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:38.654
QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:41.023
ANSWER. RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.426
FOR THE PRESENTATION AND- WHICH

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.761
ONE OF CLARIFY SOMETHING

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:46.395
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE I HEARD

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.431
IT CORRECTLY. BUT UNLIKE

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.333
CATEGORICAL FUNDS THE L. SAD

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:52.969
LC FF FUNDING IS UNRESTRICTED

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:55.938
MEANING DISTRICTS I CAN USE IT

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:57.874
FOR ANY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.675
PURPOSE PROHIBITED BY LAW SO.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:00.943
IS THERE ANYTHING IN STATE LAW

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.844
THAT REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.045
SPEND ALL OF THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:06.382
CONSTRUCTION PLANS. ON THESE

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.284
THREE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:09.619
SO YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THEY ARE

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:11.020
UNRESTRICTED FUNDS MEANING THAT

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.288
THEY COULD THEY COULD DECIDE TO

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:14.023
SPEND THE MON BOUNCING

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:15.691
BASKETBALLS ARE PLANTING SEEDS

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.426
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:20.863
HAD PUT FORTH. THE TYPE OF

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:23.399
SERVICE OR THE THING THAT THE

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.468
DISTRICT IS PURCHASING IS NOT.

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:27.370
IS NOT GOVERNED BY STATE LAW.

TO SEE THOSE DECISIONS. AND

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:13.862
SURE QUICKLY. ADVOCATES IN

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.364
OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING TO SEE

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:19.034
WHETHER. ELSE HAS WORKED THERE

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.603
THERE CONSIDER SIMILAR. THEIR

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:22.771
FIRST IS IT WORK. SECOND

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:25.941
QUESTION IS. DID THE STUDENT

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:29.845
FOR THE ARGETS BENEFIT. SO WE

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:31.446
THINK THOSE ARE THE RIGHT

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.215
QUESTIONS- WITH REGARD TO DID

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:35.283
IT WORK A DIP DEPENDS VERY MUCH

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.719
ON WHO DO WHO YOU ASK WE HAVE A

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:39.388
MIXED BAG WHEN IT COMES TO

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:40.455
OUTCOMES WE HAVE SOME

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.424
PERSISTENT GAPS IN OUR

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.859
STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES BUT

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:46.294
THERE IS SOME PROMISING NEWS ON

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:48.230
THE A THROUGH G. COMPLETION AND

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.732
GRADUATION FRONT. BUT WHEN IT

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:51.666
COMES TO DO THE INTENDANT

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:54.269
STUDENTS BENEFIT WE REALLY NEED

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:55.971
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:57.039
THEY'RE SHOCKED WHEN WE WHEN

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:59.508
YOU TELL PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:01.877
WE DON'T KNOW. WE DIDN'T FIGURE

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:07.015
THAT OUT WELL UP. SO THOSE ARE

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:08.950
MY OVERVIEW COMMENTS THAT WE

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.185
REALLY APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:12.120
WE THINK IT'S RIGHT ON POINT I

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:14.022
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:16.124
OF THE EL CAP. HAVE ANY OF YOU

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.760
HAVE. SEEN IN ALL CAPS HAVEN'T.

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:20.395
I'D SUGGEST TAKING A LOOK AT

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:22.497
ONE. THEY ARE INCREDIBLY

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.966
CUMBERSOME DIFFICULT DOCUMENTS

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:28.236
TO WORK WITH THEIR RUNNING. TWO

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:28.870
HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED SOMETIMES

01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:31.239
MORE PGES I AM GET TO MEET

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.775
SOMEONE WHO. IS NOT PAID TO

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:36.478
READ ALL CAPS PICK UP IN EL CAP

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.847
AND UNDERSTAND. I RECOGNIZE

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:40.715
THAT THERE'S BEEN MARGINAL

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:41.516
IMPROVEMENTS AND WE'RE

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.151
CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.953
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD FAITH

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.822
GOING INTO THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:48.590
BUT AS IT STANDS OUT CAP IS OF

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.959
AN OF I'M SORRY TO SAY APPLAUD

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.727
DOCUMENT AND NOT MEDIAN THE

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:54.930
MORE ARE NOT. SERVING ITS

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:59.367
PURPOSE. UP MEANT I OFFER A FEW

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:01.403
COMMON ABOUT WHY WE CHANCE. IS

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:05.440
SOMEONE. AT A PRINCIPLED LEVEL

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:06.708
JUST A REMINDER FEEL LIKE

01:19:06.775 --> 01:19:08.310
SOMETIMES WE FORGET IN THE

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:10.078
POLICY SPACE THESE ARE PUBLIC

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:13.615
DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:15.217
MONEY AND THAT A PRINCIPAL

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:17.219
LEVEL WE THINK ANYONE IN THE

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:19.287
PUBLIC SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:20.222
ALL THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING YOU

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:23.325
STE. ASIDE FROM THAT THOUGH

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:24.259
THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:26.862
FACTORS RELATED TO ENGAGEMENT

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.564
WHEN LCF WAS BORN WE WERE TOLD

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:30.832
THAT DECISION MAKING WHAT

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:32.200
HAPPENED LOCALLY BUT THAT

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.069
COMMUNITIES WOULD PLAY. AN

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:36.505
ACTIVE ROLE IN THOSE DECISIONS

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.106
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:40.375
THAT AS A COMMUNITY MEMBER OR A

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.477
PARENT. WHEN YOU LACK THE

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:43.712
INFORMATION THERE'S AN

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:45.780
IMBALANCE BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:48.383
COMMUNITIES. AND WE REALLY NEED

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.253
TO RECTIFY THAT. SECONDLY IS

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:53.722
COUNT. DID THE FUNDING. OR WAS

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:55.991
THE FUNDING USED IN THE WAY

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:58.126
THAT THE DISTRICT AGREED TO USE

01:19:58.193 --> 01:19:59.694
THEM AND THEY ALL CAP WE CAN'T.

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:02.063
REALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.933
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.169
EQUITY DID THE FUNDING HELP

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:09.337
THOSE WHO DESERVE MORE. IT'S

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:14.342
VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THAT-

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:14.976
RIGHT NOW. AND THEN LAST YOU'LL

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:18.380
SAY VOTER CONFIDENCE UP MOST OF

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:20.549
US WHO WORK IN THIS SPACE ARE

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:22.450
IN AGREEMENT THAT OUR SCHOOLS

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:24.152
ARE UNDERFUNDED AND WE WOULD

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:25.954
LIKE TO TAKE STEPS TOWARDS

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:28.056
ADEQUACY BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:30.358
ASK THE VOTERS TO INVEST MORE

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:32.027
WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:34.129
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE CURRENT

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:35.363
FUNDING IS YOU STE WE'RE GOING

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:36.898
TO BE HAVING DISCUSSIONS FOR

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:39.201
YEARS ABOUT ADEQUACY. AND

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:41.203
ADDRESS WHETHER URGES THAT WE

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.271
REALLY HOME ANSWER THESE

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:45.373
QUESTIONS FIX THE TO FIX THE

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.942
TRANSPARENCIES SO WE COULD WORK

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:49.611
TOGETHER ON A PER AT A

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.880

EVALUATION IT IS RARE I I'M

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:01.756
HARD PRESSED TO THINK OF A

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:04.759
FIELD WHERE YOU SET A GOAL AND

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:05.293
TAKES STEPS TOWARDS IT AND

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.096
EVALUATE THE DECISIONS ON THE

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:14.903

JUST ASK. A QUESTION AND THEN.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:22.010
OPENED UP TO MY COLLEAGUES TO.

01:26:22.076 --> 01:26:23.211
IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE'S IN

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:24.946
AGREEMENT WITH WHAT THE AUDITOR

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.714

ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU GUYS

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:32.820
WOULD. SEE OUR TO SEE DONE TO

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:35.790
MAKE SURE THAT THE- AND TENDED.

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:38.226
A RESOURCES ARE GOING TO THESE

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:40.361
THESE THREE THESE THREE GROUPS.

01:26:40.428 --> 01:26:46.067
OF THE INTENSIVE IN GROUPS. I'M

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:47.201
I GET INTO THE JUST AS THE I

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:49.003
THINK PART OF IS ALSO ABOUT

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:50.305
MAKING SURE THAT WERE NOT LIKE

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:51.706
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:26:51.773 --> 01:26:53.074
OVER CORRECTING SO I THINK WHAT

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:55.243
WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS HAVE THE

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:56.210
RECOMMENDATION ALL OF THE

01:26:56.277 --> 01:26:57.178

SEE HOW THAT'S WORKING IN AND

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:04.385
THEN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS OVERTIME

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:05.954
SO I THINK IF WE MAINTAIN THE

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.388
COURSE WERE ON NOW INCLUDING

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:08.957
WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED.

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:10.391
THAT THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:12.193
THAT PLAYS OUT TO SEE IT IF WE

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.796
NEED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CHANGES.

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:16.698
CHAIRMAN OF. WE DID DISCUSS THE

01:27:16.764 --> 01:27:19.434

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.036
EQUITY COALITION. AND US

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.338
SEVERAL PARTNERS WHO WORK IN

01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:25.440
THE SPACE OF. THE WE THINK THE

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:27.609
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE. EXACTLY

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.344
WHAT'S NEEDED. THE ONE THING

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.778
THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS PERHAPS

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:33.648
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE. TO COUNTY.

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:35.450

THEY REVIEW THE EL CAP. RIGHT

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:43.224
NOW THAT'S- REVIEWED PRIMARILY.

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:44.926
TO SEE WHETHER THAT DISTRICT

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.961
FOLLOWED. THE EL CAP I THINK

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:49.130
REQUIREMENTS INSTRUCTIONS. AND

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:50.898
PERHAPS STRENGTHENING THAT

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:52.767
REPEAT SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:55.903

HAS BEEN MADE ON THE AL CAPP IN

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:59.907
THE STATE BOARD AND WE HAVE

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.643
BEEN THERE PUBLICLY TO STATE

01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:03.544
THAT SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION I

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:04.912
THINK OUR CONCERN. IS ON WHAT

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:07.048
OF A TRACKING MECHANISM AND THE

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:10.218
FUTURE WOULD LOOK LIKE- AND

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:10.785
THAT IS JUST A QUESTION AND

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:12.220
CONCERN. YEAH AND I KNOW WE'RE

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:14.589
ALL ANTICIPATING HER EAGERLY A

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.057
PROBABLY ANTICIPATING WHAT THE

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.258
ALL CAPS CAN LOOK LIKE WITH THE

01:28:17.325 --> 01:28:18.626
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:19.894
ACTUALLY DOING TO NOT ONLY

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.396
REVIEW THE TEMPLATE. BUDGET

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:22.597
INSURE THAT THE TRANSPARENCY IN

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:24.399
THE CARRABELLE ANY IS THERE FOR

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:26.534
THESE INTENDED PURPOSES- SO

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:28.169
WE'RE WITH YOU ON THAT AS WELL.

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:28.670
SO LET ME ASK YOU IS A

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:32.540
DIFFERENT QUESTION- WE KEEP

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:34.008
TALKING ABOUT THE INTENDED

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.743
PURPOSES OF LCF FOR THESE

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.545
STUDENT GROUPS. BUT IS THERE

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:39.447
ANYTHING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE

01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:41.582
THAT WE CAN DO MAYBE TWO. HOW

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:43.584
DO WE ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURE

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:45.653
FROM. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.655
TRY TO GO AFTER THESE FUNDS.

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:49.390
RIGHT I MEAN IS IT. INCREASING

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.159
BASS FINDING IT I MEAN IS THAT

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:54.462
WHY. LIKE WHERE THE GAPS AND

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:57.598
WHY IT WHY ARE THERE PRESSURES.

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.367
TO TWO AB USES RESOURCES FOR

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:05.039
OTHER THINGS. I HEARD ON BEHALF

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:07.408
OF MY ORGANIZATION. WE

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.177
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:11.879
UNDERFUNDED-GETTING DOWN TO

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:14.182
FAX TO I THINK ESTIMATED AN

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:15.917
ADDITIONAL TWENTY BILLION

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.685
DOLLARS ARE OVER TWENTY BILLION

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:19.220
THAT'S REQUIRED TO PROVIDE OUR

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:20.788
STUDENTS INADEQUATE EDUCATION

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:23.224
SO I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THE

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:25.960
PRESSURES DISTRICTS ARE UNDER-

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.062
TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND WE NEED

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:30.031
TO WORK TOGETHER THINK TO PUT

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:32.567
MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM. BUT

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:34.435
AS AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:37.405
MORE MONEY ISN'T THE ANSWER

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:39.207
ALONE IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE

01:29:39.273 --> 01:29:42.910
MONEY IS USED SO- BUT I THINK

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:46.714
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:48.983
ADEQUACY. YOU AT. VERY MUCH

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.319

FOR THE BASE GRANT ANY

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.488
ADDITIONAL ONE TIME

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.223
DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS I WILL

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:56.891
ALLOW US TO CONTINUE USE OF

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:57.792
FUNDING FOR THE FOR OTHER

01:29:57.859 --> 01:30:00.361
PURPOSES AS WELL AS- ANY

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:01.863
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO HELP

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:04.766
RELIEVE SOME PENSION COSTS. GOD

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:07.335
OKAY I'M MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:07.969
SCHOOL GROUPS WHEN THEY COME UP

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:10.138
NEXT. LIKE WHERE THE GAPS ARE

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:11.339
WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO FILL

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:13.574
BUT- THERE'S NO QUESTIONS

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:15.910
SOMEONE RECORDS OF A PLACE. SO

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:17.879
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE L.

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:20.248
CANNOT IN THE SUPPLEMENT GROUPS

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:22.483

FAR AS PARENTS KIND OF GETTING

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:32.760
BUT IT'S NOT ALL EVEN TEACHER

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:34.796
FRIENDLY. BECAUSE MANY MANY OF

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.397
THE EDUCATORS DON'T EVER

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:38.399
INTERACT WITH THIS DOCUMENT IS

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:40.535

LEVEL BY A PRINCIPAL OR A

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.506
LEADERSHIP TEAM SO EVEN HOW WE

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:47.308
FUND OUR SCHOOLS PERIOD I WOULD

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:49.243
TELL YOU PROBABLY 80% OF THE

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:50.678
TEACHERS DON'T EVEN KNOW. IT'S

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:52.980
THEY HAVE THEIR CLASSROOMS THEY

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:56.484
TO IMPLEMENT AND THE DECISIONS

01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:59.587
EVEN HOW THE MONEY IS USED UP

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:01.489
PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN NORMALLY

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:03.891
COME UP AND REGULAR

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.126
CONVERSATIONS FOR TEACHERS.

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:07.495
BECAUSE AGAIN USUALLY DO AT A

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:09.797
DISTRICT LEVEL. BUT IF YOU

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.199
COULD SPEAK IN MIND OF PARENT

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:15.903
LANGUAGE WHICH IS OF. EVEN

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:18.206
THOUGH WE ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE

01:31:18.272 --> 01:31:20.341
THE DOCUMENT AND OUTCOMES FOR

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:22.176
OUR SUPPLEMENT GROUPS THERE HAS

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.978
TO BE SOME TYPE OF DATA ACROSS

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:26.080
THE STATE THAT AFTER SIX YEARS

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.015
OF VIEW OF. KIND OF GOING

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:30.985
THROUGH THIS. NEW PROCESS OF

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:33.387
THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE WORKED

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:35.122
BECAUSE I ALWAYS FEAR THAT EVEN

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.557
THOUGH WE'RE DOING ALL THIS

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:38.659
TRYING TO IMPROVE A DOCUMENT

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:40.528
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE WANT TO

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:43.497
IMPROVE THE- THE EXPERIENCE FOR

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:45.166
NOT ONLY THE KIDS IN THE

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:46.934
CLASSROOM THAT ARE IN THAT.

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:48.336
GROUPS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:50.638
BUT FOR ALL OF THE KIDS AND WE

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:53.474
WANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:55.109
TYPE OF PROCESS THAT WE CAN GO

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.344
THROUGH THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WE

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:57.678
THINK THAT REALLY WORKS.

01:31:57.745 --> 01:31:59.146
BECAUSE WE COULD KEEP GOING

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:01.082
THROUGH THIS AND STILL HAVE THE

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:02.850
SAME OUTCOMES EVEN IF THEY'RE

01:32:02.917 --> 01:32:05.286
MORE TRANSPARENT SO LET ME JUST

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.488
GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. WITH THAT

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:11.826
AT THE STATE. THAT WE KNOW.

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:14.295
THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF THIS

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:17.265
IS IN THE CLASSROOMS TO FOCUS

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:19.166
ON THAT TEST AND HAVE BETTER

01:32:19.233 --> 01:32:20.501
ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S IN

01:32:20.568 --> 01:32:22.236
ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE USING TO

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:24.105
DETERMINE WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:25.606
BELIEVE IT OR NOT I DON'T THINK

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:26.874
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:28.042
BUT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:32.346
SO THAT TEST IS NOW BEING.

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:36.484
TAKEN ON IPAD. AND I KNOW THAT

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.286
WE HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:40.588
DOLLARS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:43.257
TECHNOLOGY OVER THE LAST DECADE

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:45.459
WHETHER IT'S IPADS OR COMPUTERS

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:46.894
WHATEVER IT IS AND IT CHANGES

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:49.463
EVERY TWO MINUTES. AND YET THE

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:52.433
BASIC MATERIAL THAT STUDENTS

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.969
NEED IS A KEYBOARD. AND I'VE

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:56.804
SEEN OVER AND OVER SCHOOLS

01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:58.472
AREN'T BUYING KEYBOARDS OR

01:32:58.539 --> 01:33:00.074
THEY'RE HIDING THEM IN THE

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:02.076
CLOSET BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.611
TO RUIN BECAUSE WHEN YOU TEST

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.246
YOU NEED TO HAVE ALL YOUR

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:06.747
KEYBOARDS WORKING IN THE MALL

01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:08.482
CHARGE THE SOUNDS REALLY KIND

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:10.051
OF IN THE WEEDS. BUT THEN

01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:11.953
SCHOOLS STILL ARE TRYING TO GET

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.788
MONEY FOR KEYBOARDS. AND

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:14.956
THEY'RE NOT EVEN TEACHING

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:17.258
KEYBOARDING SO WHO'S GOING TO

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:18.292
HAVE THE ACCESS ISSUE WHEN YOU

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:19.961
GO INTO THIRD GRADE AND YOU

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:22.763
HAVE TO WRITE US THREE TO FOUR

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:24.265
PARAGRAPH ESSAY AND THEY'VE

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:25.900
NEVER HAD KEYBOARDING AND YEAH

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:27.735
THAT'S ONE OF THE TESTING SO

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:29.470
HOW DO WE DECIDE FOR ALL OF

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:31.072
THIS. AND GET TO WILL ALREADY

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:33.774
KNOW CREATE BARRIERS AND ACCESS

01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:35.343
SO WHO'S GOING TO TAPPED HIGHER

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.778
OR LOWER WITH JUST THAT ONE

01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:40.715
EXAMPLE. KIDS WEB INTERNET

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:43.784
INTERNET AND HAVE KEYBOARDS AND

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:44.352
AT PRACTICE OR KIDS WHO HAVE

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:52.727
NONE OF THAT. I'M SORRY MISS

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:53.327
QUIRK SILVA I'M NOT HE SAID A

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:56.330
LOT. I'M HAVING TROUBLE

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:57.765
TRACKING THOSE IT WAS THE

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.800
REQUESTED OKAY AS I GUESS IT

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:01.836
WAS A COMMENT LIKE ALL OF THESE

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:03.037
DISCUSSIONS WE CAN HAVE THE

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:05.272
BOTTOM LINE WE CAN PUT MORE

01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:06.540
MONEY INTO SYSTEM WE CAN DO

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.309
THIS BUT IF WE'RE NOT STILL

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:09.844
RECOGNIZING THE BASIC THINGS

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.946
THAT CREATE BARRIERS FOR OUR

01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:14.148
KIDS AND MOST OF THE TIME

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:14.715
THEY'RE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:17.351
GROUPS. THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS

01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:18.652
TO THE SAME TYPE OF EXPERIENCES

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:21.756
OTHER UP KIDS HAVE AND THEN WE

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:23.791
DO SAY NOW WE HAVE THE MONEY.

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:25.393
FOR IT WE STILL DON'T USE IT

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:26.961
HOW CAN WE FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:28.396
GOING TO CLOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:30.598
GAP. FOR THE WHAT THE ONE THING

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:32.366
I WOULD ADD TO THAT I THINK

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:33.334
THIS IS PART OF THE THAT THE

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.702
PROMISE OF THE SYSTEM OF

01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:36.704
SUPPORT WHICH IS REALLY. AROUND

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:37.972
TRYING TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:39.006
REDISTRICTING THAT DOESN'T

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:40.274
DIRECTLY INTO YOUR QUESTION BUT

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:41.575
I THINK. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:42.576
GETTING INTO WE YOU KNOW WE

01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:44.045
NEED DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:45.346
HAPPENING SO MORE AND BETTER

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.615
DATA- YOU ACROSS SYSTEMS WE

01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:48.849
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT SO WE

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.351
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF.

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:51.385
EARLY LEARNING AND HOW THAT

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:52.920
PLAYS INTO THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:54.822
RIGHT FROM FROM T. CARE

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.724
KINDERGARTEN- BUT HOW DO WE-

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:58.793
KNOW WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.194
NOT APPLY BEST PRACTICES. AND

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:01.162
AGAIN I THINK THAT'S PART OF

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:02.263
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYSTEM OF

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.298
SUPPORT IS THAT IT WILL- IT

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.633
TAKE THOSE DISTRICTS THAT THAT

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:07.268
ARE STRUGGLING IN IN VARIOUS

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:08.636
WAYS AND BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:10.805
THEM. I IDEALLY YOU UTILIZING

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:13.374
BEST PRACTICES. I WOULD

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.176
DISAGREE WHATEVER ON THAT AS WE

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:16.944
ARE SEEING UPDATES TO THE

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:19.880
DASHBOARD WILL START BEING ABLE

01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:23.851
TO IDENTIFY IT. HOW WE CAN.

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:28.923
SERVICE FIRST. COME. I THINK

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:31.158
YEAH. OKAY THAT'S SWEET. THE

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:32.626
THAT'S THE IN. OF THE OF THE

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:33.394
OKAY IN THE- LOW CONTROL

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:34.995
FUNDING FORMULA AND ALL THOSE

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:36.130
KINDS OF THINGS WE DON'T. WE

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:37.598
SHOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT THAT.

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:40.067
THE OUTCOME THE IT THE PURPOSE

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:41.702
OF ALL OF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:43.904
IMPROVE STUDENT PERFORMANCE. OF

01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:45.906
AN OUTCOME FOR KIDS IN IN IN

01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:47.808
THE STATE WHETHER THEY'RE THE-

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.910
THE KIDS GETTING THE BASS GRANT

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:51.112
WHETHER THAT KIDS WILL GETTING

01:35:51.178 --> 01:35:52.346
THE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL.

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:54.315
THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT LOCAL

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:55.883
CONTROL THE ABILITY OF

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.052
EDUCATORS TO SIT. AND TO DECIDE

01:35:58.119 --> 01:36:00.387
HOW TO USE DOLLARS. NOT JUST

01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:02.256
FOR THEIR CONVENIENCE BUT FOR

01:36:02.323 --> 01:36:03.691
THE PROGRESS OF THE STUDENTS.

01:36:03.757 --> 01:36:05.459
IS CRITICAL THAT ONE SIZE DOES

01:36:05.526 --> 01:36:08.062
NOT FIT ALL AND YET AT THE SAME

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:09.296
TIME IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:10.598
DATA. AND MOST OF

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:12.299
ADMINISTRATORS WILL IT NOT WAS

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:13.467
THAT THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:14.668
GOOD DATA AT THEIR SCHOOLS.

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:16.303
THEY HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THE

01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:17.671
MONEY'S GOING AND THEY HAVE TO

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:20.107
HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THAT

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:22.676
DATA. IN THE PROMISED WELL AS

01:36:22.743 --> 01:36:23.711
AT THE END OF YOUR TO DETERMINE

01:36:23.777 --> 01:36:26.046
WHAT THE NOT. WHAT IS IT

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:27.281
WORKING. AND THAT ONE OF THE

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:29.483
REAL CHALLENGE IS THAT. YOU

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:30.551
KNOW WHEN WE WERE GETTING READY

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.753
TO DO. SO ADDITIONALLY THE L.

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:36.023
FF AND- I WENT TO SEVERAL. OF

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:38.492
MEETINGS IT AT SCHOOL. AND MANY

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:44.165
MANY VERY. AND TOLD AND I WAS

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:44.965
TELLING THEM WHAT THE INTO WAS.

01:36:45.032 --> 01:36:47.201
DIGITAL DOT. AND THEY SAID WELL

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:47.801
GREAT THE MOVE TO GET BACK OUR

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:48.736
LIVE. AND WE'RE TO GO IN THEY

01:36:48.802 --> 01:36:49.570
MEDIA HAD A LIVE OF THINGS THEY

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.605
WANTED TO GO BACK AND GET. AND

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:53.207
I SAID OKAY THAT SOUNDS GOOD

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.608
WHEN YOU HAD A LIBRARIAN OR

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:56.644
LIBRARY A NEW SCHOOL WELL AS

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.112
THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STUDENTS

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:00.181
AT THE TIME. ALL THE SAME AS IT

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:02.082
IS THE DAY OKAY WHY WOULD YOU

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:03.717
GO BACK INTO THEIR- WEDDING

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:04.618
THOUGHT ABOUT A JUST FIGURE

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:05.219
THIS IS WHAT WE DON'T DO THEM

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:06.187
UP AND GET ALL PIC OF THESE

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:07.721
THINGS I'M SAYING NO. YOU

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.223
SHOULD BE ASSESSING IT BECAUSE

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:10.524
I'M NOT SAYING DON'T GET A

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:12.259
LIBRARIAN. WHAT I'M SAYING IF

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:14.595
YOU GET ONE DON'T GET ONE LIKE

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.430
YOU HAD BEFORE THEY HAVE NO

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:17.064
CONNECTION WHATSOEVER. MAYBE TO

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:19.033
THE LIMITS OF STUDENT. AND IF

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:20.334
YOU GET KNOW SO. PEOPLE WERE

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:22.136
GOING BACK AND GRABBING THINGS

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:25.172
THAT WERE COMFORTABLE. UP AND

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.273
I'M SAYING TO THEM THAT'S NOT

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.409
WHAT LOCAL CONTROL IS ABOUT

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:30.511
LOCAL CONTROL ABOUT. SAYING IF

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:32.213
THAT'S A CASE AND CAN GIVE YOU

01:37:32.279 --> 01:37:34.114
GOTTA GO BECAUSE IT'S OKAY YOU

01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:36.150
MONEY TO LIVE. IS YOU MIGHT FOR

01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:36.884
THIS YOU'RE MY FOR THAT AND

01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:37.818
THEN YOU COMPLY. THAT YOU WE

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:38.619
TALK YOU HOW TO USE ALL THE

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.120
MONEY IN IT DOESN'T WORK. SO

PRACTICE ACCOUNTABILITY IS

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:11.184
NOTHING WE'VE EVER TRIED A WAVE

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:14.387
I'M WE LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:14.954
WHAT CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:16.389
FOR ANY. HOW TO WOMEN AND BILL

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:17.891
FOR THAT AND SO WE DO A OKAY

01:53:17.957 --> 01:53:20.894
THAPAR DETERIORATE THROUGH NO

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:23.296
FAULT. I CAN STATE LAWS FOR THE

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:24.731
CLOSED BY SWITCH BECAUSE- WE

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:26.766
ARE DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICT-

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:28.501
WE ARE LARGE AS AS MUCH RIGHT

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:31.004
AT THE WHY WE'RE WHICH

01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:36.376
ESSENTIAL. WE DO NOT LEAVE ANY.

01:53:36.442 --> 01:53:38.511
SITUATION I'M SORRY RIP YEAH

01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:39.512
BUT- MANY CONCENTRATION FUNDS.

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:40.980
JUST SUPPLEMENTAL. WHETHER YOU

01:53:41.047 --> 01:53:41.481
PP OF A FORTY. PERCENT

01:53:41.548 --> 01:53:43.049
CURRENTLY. IT'S BEEN IN EACH.

01:53:43.116 --> 01:53:44.050
AS OUR- INCREASES AND WE ARE

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:45.118
GROWING SCHOOL DISTRICT THERE'S

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:46.686
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE A

01:53:46.753 --> 01:53:48.454
GRADUATION RATE OF NINETY FOUR

01:53:48.521 --> 01:53:50.290
POINT 4% AND WE REALLY HAVE.

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:52.258
TRY TO INCREASE WITH OUR

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:54.294
SERVICES- UTILIZING THE ALL

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.196
CAPS ALL OF SERVICES TO THE

01:53:56.262 --> 01:53:58.364
UCBCP- STUDENTS THAT- REALLY

01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:00.066
THAT MNEY WAS. BEING DIRECTED

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:01.367
TOWARDS AND WE THINK WE HAVE

01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:03.469
SEEN. AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP

01:54:03.536 --> 01:54:05.371
CLOSURE NOT THE RATE THAT I

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:06.940
THINK ANYBODY WOULD BE HAPPY

01:54:07.006 --> 01:54:07.941
WITH THEM WE'RE NEVER HAPPY

01:54:08.007 --> 01:54:09.542
WITH THAT WE ALWAYS WANT TO SEE.

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:11.844
OF OUR STUDENTS EXCEEDING.

01:54:11.911 --> 01:54:12.478
THINK THAT PLAN REALLY HELPED

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:14.948
US. I DO THAT- THE AUDIT DID

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.549
COMMAND CLOVIS UNIFIED VIRGINAL

01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:17.150
TRACKING OF OUR SUPPLEMENTAL

01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:19.152
FUNDS WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN A

01:54:19.219 --> 01:54:19.819
CHALLENGE. I KNOW IN SOME

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:22.021
DISTRICTS. AND ARSES TO PRINT

01:54:22.088 --> 01:54:23.256
AND IF- BUSINESS SOURCES SOON

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:24.524
RUTLEDGE REALLY CREATE A SYSTEM

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:26.492
WHERE WE COULD TRACK. THOSE

01:54:26.559 --> 01:54:27.794
FUNDS. IN I THINK WE ARE

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:28.995
COMMITTED FOR THAT IN THE AUDIT

01:54:29.062 --> 01:54:30.597
AND I THINK IT HAS HELPED US.

01:54:30.663 --> 01:54:32.398
AT LEAST DETERMINE- THAT WE DO

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:33.633
ACKNOWLEDGE THE DIRECT

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.368
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

01:54:35.435 --> 01:54:37.604
SERVICES. AND THE OUTCOMES AS

01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:40.306
BEING H. H. WE ACTUALLY CREATE

01:54:40.373 --> 01:54:44.544
OUR OWN INTERNAL. OUR PROGRAM

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:45.345
IS ACTUALLY CREE OWN. AUDITING

01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:47.947
SO. TO REDUCE THE DASH. AS WAS

01:54:48.014 --> 01:54:49.215
COMMON BEFORE WE'VE HAD THE

01:54:49.282 --> 01:54:51.150
DASH WORK FOR TWO YEARS. AND

01:54:51.217 --> 01:54:52.318
WHAT WE HAVE REALLY BEEN ABLE

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.886
TRYING TO DETERMINE IS EXACTLY

01:54:53.953 --> 01:54:54.754
WHAT STUDENTS THAT WERE

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:56.356
FOCUSING ON AND HOW DO WE SEE

01:54:56.422 --> 01:54:57.290
NOT JUST AT THE END OF THE

01:54:57.357 --> 01:54:58.925
YEAR. BUT ALSO ON GOING THE

01:54:58.992 --> 01:55:00.627
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS WE WOULD

01:55:00.693 --> 01:55:02.295
WITH ACADEMIC ASSESSMENTS. AND

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:03.596
ACHIEVEMENT YOU DON'T JUST WAIT

01:55:03.663 --> 01:55:04.397
TO THE END OF THE YEAR TO SEE

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:05.198
HOW WELL THE STUDENTS DID YOUR

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:06.266
MONITORING PROGRESS ALL

01:55:06.332 --> 01:55:07.634
THROUGH. AND SO WE HAVE DONE

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:10.136
THE SAME WITH THAT- I THINK THE

01:55:10.203 --> 01:55:11.471
FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE

01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:13.039
CALIFORNIA STARS ACCOUNT CODE

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:14.474
STRUCTURE IS FALSELY SOMETHING

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.442
THAT. CAN BE UTILIZED BUT IT'S

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:17.577
A CHALLENGE THERE'S NO DOUBT

01:55:17.644 --> 01:55:18.611
ABOUT THAT. FOR SCHOOL

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:20.913
DISTRICTS TO NOT BE ABLE TO

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.815
MONITOR THOSE- THE U. OVER HAS

01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:24.484
BEEN COMMENTED BEFORE- THE WE

01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:25.518
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRACK CARRY

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:26.919
OVER AND HOW IT'S BEING SPENT

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:28.221
BUT WE ALSO WELCOME THE

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:29.622
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE- OF THE

01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:30.823
STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND WE

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:32.759
CAN- DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AS I

01:55:32.825 --> 01:55:34.160
AS WE ALL KIND OF MAKING SURE

01:55:34.227 --> 01:55:35.695
THAT DOES GO DIRECTLY BACK TO

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:37.597
THE STUDENTS- FOR WHICH THE

01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:38.798
FUNDS WERE. AGAIN THAT WASN'T

01:55:38.865 --> 01:55:40.466
HOW THE LAW WAS WRITTEN- BUT

01:55:40.533 --> 01:55:42.001
WE'VE ALWAYS MADE THAT A

01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:43.970
PRIORITY OF OUR CARRYOVER FUNDS

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:44.704
TO GO BACK TO SOURCES THAT

01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:46.406
MAYBE WE WANT TO SET TO.

01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:48.141
PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR THAT

01:55:48.207 --> 01:55:51.044
WE WERE SEEING GROWTH IN. AND I

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:54.547

BE EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE OUTCOMES

02:10:37.563 --> 02:10:39.198
FOR OUR STUDENTS AND IT ISN'T

02:10:39.264 --> 02:10:41.900
JUST THE SUPPLEMENT STUDENTS

02:10:41.967 --> 02:10:43.368
IT'S FOR ALL OF THEM WE AS

02:10:43.435 --> 02:10:46.972
PARENTS AND AS- EDUCATORS AND

02:10:47.039 --> 02:10:48.574
TAXPAYERS IN THE STATE OF

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.776
CALIFORNIA WANT TO SEE OUR

02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:52.211
STUDENTS ACHIEVE BOTTOM LINE.

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:54.613
AND THERE'S MULTIPLE MEASURES

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:55.847
FOR THAT LIKE YOU SAID IT ISN'T

02:10:55.914 --> 02:10:59.418
JUST ON ACADEMICS IT'S ON THERE

02:10:59.484 --> 02:11:02.921
SO MANY THINGS ARE FAMILIES AND

02:11:02.988 --> 02:11:06.358
STUDENTS ARE IN A NOT ONLY NOW

02:11:06.425 --> 02:11:10.495
BUT IN THE PAST. ONE TO SAY

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:11.230
THAT BIG THERE'S A LOT OF

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:12.331
PEOPLE IN OUT THERE I NO WAY

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:14.166
ASK FOR THIS AUDIT BECAUSE I

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:15.567
DON'T BELIEVE GOOD WORK IS

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:17.703
BEING HAVE HAPPENING OUT THERE

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:20.439
AND ALSO I IN NO WAY BELIEVE

02:11:20.505 --> 02:11:23.475
IT'S EASY TO TAKE SOMETHING AT

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:25.677
THAT HAS BEEN SYSTEMIC FOR

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:28.747
DECADES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN-

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:31.950
CHANGE OUTCOMES SO WELL OVER

02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:34.319
TEN YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS EVEN

02:11:34.386 --> 02:11:37.022
UP HERE AS A TEACHER IN MY

02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:38.457
SCHOOL DISTRICT I WAS ALSO AT

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:40.459
THE SAME TIME AIR OF FULLER AND

02:11:40.525 --> 02:11:42.361
IN WE TRIED TO JUST LOCALLY

02:11:42.427 --> 02:11:45.364
LOOK AT CHIEF AND GAP THIS IS

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:47.733
TWO YEARS AGO OR MORE. MAYBE

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:49.301
EVEN TWELVE IN THAT POINT WE

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:52.204
COULD ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THERE WAS

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:52.971
AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP SO WE'VE

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:55.407
MOVED QUITE FAR IN THAT SENSE

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:58.010
THAT I THINK THE COMMON-

02:11:58.076 --> 02:12:00.712
DISCUSSION IS YES THERE IS A

02:12:00.779 --> 02:12:03.849
PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAP

02:12:03.915 --> 02:12:05.951
HOW'D WHO TACKLE IT THE

02:12:06.018 --> 02:12:08.420
EVERYTHING FROM LIKE WE SAID ON

02:12:08.487 --> 02:12:10.756
SELECTED TO READ INTERVIEW. TO

02:12:10.822 --> 02:12:13.225
OF YOU KNOW SO MANY THINGS COME

02:12:13.292 --> 02:12:15.727
THAT COME IN INCOME OUT OF

02:12:15.794 --> 02:12:18.797
EDUCATION I FOR ONE WOULD TO

02:12:18.864 --> 02:12:22.067
SEE FRIDAY COME BACK UP BECAUSE

02:12:22.134 --> 02:12:23.235
I KNOW SO THE THING IT'S AND

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:24.569
BUT THAT'S MY LOOK THAT'S MY

02:12:24.636 --> 02:12:26.538
LITTLE THING I KNOW- OF THERE'S

02:12:26.605 --> 02:12:28.273
LOTS OF RESEARCH THAT SAYS IT

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:30.275
DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT THAT

02:12:30.342 --> 02:12:31.777
BEING SAID IT IS BECAUSE I

02:12:31.843 --> 02:12:35.981
DON'T BELIEVE EVERY SCHOOL THAT

02:12:36.048 --> 02:12:40.519
SAYS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:44.122
BEST BUT WHEN YOU MENTION LIGHT

02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:50.329
NOW WE NEED TO AB IT HARD FOR

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:56.735
PARENTS. YOU'RE NOT DOING IT

02:12:56.802 --> 02:12:58.337
RIGHT OR OR WE DON'T LIKE WHAT

02:12:58.403 --> 02:12:59.471
YOU'RE DOING WE'RE JUST TRYING

02:12:59.538 --> 02:13:02.774
TO SAY IF YOU'RE A PARENT AND

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:03.909
FOR MANY PARENTS WHO DON'T

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.844
SPEAK ENGLISH HOW DO YOU GET

02:13:05.911 --> 02:13:08.313
THE BEST INFORMATION BUT THE

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:10.582
SECOND PART OF THAT IS IN THAT

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:13.885
LONG- TECHNOLOGY QUESTION I HAD

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:16.288
RELATED TO IPADS AND STUFF IT'S

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:18.323
REALLY ACROSS THE STATE EVEN IF

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:21.493
WE HADN'T ASKED FOR THE AUDIT-

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.029
WITH ALL THE WORK CAN WE START

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:27.199
TO SEE TRENDS THAT WE KNOW OUR

02:13:27.265 --> 02:13:29.935
BEST PRACTICES. REALLY DO WORK

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:34.906
SO THAT I LIKE IS THERE A WAY

02:13:34.973 --> 02:13:37.175
TO START TO COMMUNICATE THAT SO

02:13:37.242 --> 02:13:38.777
THAT IF WE SAY WE WANT

02:13:38.844 --> 02:13:40.979
EVERYBODY AS DOCTOR LEPPARD

02:13:41.046 --> 02:13:42.447
SAID AT THE CAPITOL BY THIS

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:44.116
TIME AND WE'RE TRYING ALL THESE

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:45.884
DIFFERENT THINGS AND EVERYBODY

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:47.586
HAS THEIR KINDA LIKE LITTLE

02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:50.422
SPECIAL THING HAVE WE SEEN ANY

02:13:50.489 --> 02:13:54.826
OVER LINE. TRACK THAT REALLY

02:13:54.893 --> 02:13:57.329
HAS CHAU WHEN THE GROWTH- AND

02:13:57.396 --> 02:13:59.364
I'M TALKING REALLY MAYBE K.

02:13:59.431 --> 02:14:00.532
EIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE

02:14:00.599 --> 02:14:02.267
SEE THAT IF STUDENTS AREN'T

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:04.503
ACHIEVING. LIKE ONE OF THE

02:14:04.569 --> 02:14:06.171
INDICATORS IS READING BY THIRD

02:14:06.238 --> 02:14:07.639
GRADE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO

02:14:07.706 --> 02:14:08.740
START TO SEE THAT FALL OFF

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:10.609
THEY'RE NOT LEARNING- THEY'VE

02:14:10.675 --> 02:14:12.210
BEEN HERE FOR MANY YEARS AND

02:14:12.277 --> 02:14:14.212
THEN THEY'RE NOT MOVING OUT OF

02:14:14.279 --> 02:14:15.914
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROGRAMS.

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:17.916
SO I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION

02:14:17.983 --> 02:14:20.719
ARE THERE TRENDS OR PRACTICES

02:14:20.786 --> 02:14:23.588
THAT WE JUST REALLY NO WORK AND

02:14:23.655 --> 02:14:24.923
IF THERE ARE CAN THOSE BE

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:28.393
COMMUNICATED. DISTRICTS WITH. A

02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:30.529
SUGGESTION NOT A MANDATE SO

02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:32.030
THAT WE AREN'T USING HUGE

02:14:32.097 --> 02:14:33.665
AMOUNT OF ROUGH AT REVENUE ON

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.467
ALL KINDS OF THINGS BECAUSE

02:14:35.534 --> 02:14:36.635
THEY'RE INTERESTING BUT WE

02:14:36.701 --> 02:14:38.203
HAVEN'T SEEN THAT THEY WORK.

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:40.038
YEAH SO THERE'S A THERE'S A

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:41.273
QUITE A BIT OF BEST PRACTICE

02:14:41.339 --> 02:14:43.408
OUT THERE. WHEN THE MEMBER

02:14:43.475 --> 02:14:44.443
ABOUT BUT PRACTICE IS THE A

02:14:44.509 --> 02:14:47.279
BEST JUSTIN OPEN. MAY NOT BE

02:14:47.345 --> 02:14:48.914
THE BEST PRACTICE FOR CLUB S.

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:51.650
UNIFIED AND SO IT IS ROLE IS

02:14:51.716 --> 02:14:53.852
THE DEPARTMENT TO UNDERSTAND

02:14:53.919 --> 02:14:55.987
WHAT ALL THOSE BEST PRACTICES

02:14:56.054 --> 02:14:57.622
OUT THERE AND THEN COMMUNICATE

02:14:57.689 --> 02:15:00.959
THAT TO. X. HERE'S A PLETHORA

02:15:01.026 --> 02:15:04.996
OF ABOUT THAT WE'VE SEEN STATE

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:11.036
IN MANY. YOU GO. YOU KNOW WHAT

02:15:11.102 --> 02:15:12.204
CAN LEARN FROM FROM YOUR OTHER

02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:14.105
CALL AND TO. AND SO ONE OF THE

02:15:14.172 --> 02:15:15.073
THINGS THAT WE ARE. ON IS THE

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.476

AROUND. ENGAGE WE WERE. FULL

02:15:33.992 --> 02:15:34.626

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.331
DIFFERENT WAYS. THANK YOU.

AND I KNOW MISS WEBBER CARES

02:15:50.075 --> 02:15:51.142
ABOUT THINK TO START ABOUT THIS

02:15:51.209 --> 02:15:53.044
BEFORE LOOKING AT THE ACADEMIC

02:15:53.111 --> 02:15:53.778
GROWTH THE ACADEMIC

02:15:53.845 --> 02:15:55.480

NOT MEETING THE MARK. AND SO

02:16:04.456 --> 02:16:06.424
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE-

02:16:06.491 --> 02:16:07.759
I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THESE

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:09.427

FOR IN OUR LISTENING SOME OF

02:18:21.526 --> 02:18:23.461
THE WHEN I WAS OF. REALLY

02:18:23.528 --> 02:18:24.996
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS

02:18:25.063 --> 02:18:26.865
CONCERNING- WHAT WE NEED TO DO

02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:28.833
AND OBVIOUSLY ACCOUNTABILITY IS

02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:30.268
AT THE TOP NOW OF EVERYBODY'S

02:18:30.335 --> 02:18:32.604
LIST FINALLY WE HOPE. OUR AND

02:18:32.671 --> 02:18:34.439
THAT THAT WE WILL DO THE THINGS

02:18:34.506 --> 02:18:36.908
THAT ARE ESSENTIAL. I WILL AND

02:18:36.975 --> 02:18:37.542
I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:18:37.609 --> 02:18:38.910
FACT THAT DID SOMEWHAT

02:18:38.977 --> 02:18:40.945
CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW- JUST

02:18:41.012 --> 02:18:42.881
REPORTING WHERE THE MONEY IS

02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:46.751
PERFORMANCE AND THAT IS

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.620
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. AND SO IN

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:51.890
ADDITION TO THAT I THINK AT

02:18:51.956 --> 02:18:52.490
SOME POINT THE LEGISLATURE HAS

02:18:52.557 --> 02:18:55.827
TO DECIDE IT REALLY HAVE. BEEN

02:18:55.894 --> 02:18:57.529
TO EVERY CHALLENGE. ARE AND I

02:18:57.595 --> 02:18:59.064
THINK IT'S E. O. HAS HAVE THE

02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:00.899
SAME QUESTION IT THAT THEY ASK

02:19:00.965 --> 02:19:02.567
THEMSELVES ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:04.169
WHEN I LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF

02:19:04.235 --> 02:19:05.670
MONEY THAT WE HAVE SPENT.

02:19:05.737 --> 02:19:06.938
RECENTLY ON IT ON THIS

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:08.707
PARTICULAR PROJECT AND HOW DID

02:19:08.773 --> 02:19:09.941
NOT GO TO THE PLACES THAT

02:19:10.008 --> 02:19:11.910
INTENDED TO GO. IT BREAKS MY

02:19:11.976 --> 02:19:13.978
HEART BECAUSE- FIVE AND SIX

02:19:14.045 --> 02:19:15.647
YEARS IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD IS

02:19:15.714 --> 02:19:17.816
A VERY LONG TIME. AND IF YOU

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:20.318
MISS FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF. OF

02:19:20.385 --> 02:19:21.920
SCHOOL. ARE AND GETTING

02:19:21.986 --> 02:19:23.588
ADEQUATE SUPPORT THAT REALLY

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:25.623
IMPACTS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE I MEAN

02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:27.926
IT'S- I DON'T THINK ANY OF US

02:19:27.992 --> 02:19:29.427
WOULD DONATE FIVE OR SIX YEARS

02:19:29.494 --> 02:19:31.596
OF OUR- LIFE. TO PROGRAM THAT'S

02:19:31.663 --> 02:19:33.031
FAILING OR TO AN ENVIRONMENT

02:19:33.098 --> 02:19:34.799
THAT IS NOT ADEQUATELY MEETING

02:19:34.866 --> 02:19:36.768
THEIR NEEDS. SO WE HAVE TO YOU

02:19:36.835 --> 02:19:39.871
KNOW I WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:40.572
WHAT WE GO IF WAS SERIOUS. AND

02:19:40.638 --> 02:19:42.340
LOOKING AT MONEY ONE THING THAT

02:19:42.407 --> 02:19:46.811
WHAT MEN AND. ABLE ABOUT MAKING

02:19:46.878 --> 02:19:48.513
THAT BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE. A

02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:49.981
DECISION OF A RELEASED HIS

02:19:50.048 --> 02:19:50.849
ABOUT EDUCATING THESE KEY. I

02:19:50.915 --> 02:19:51.483
MEAN IF WE WERE ARE AND I'M NOT

02:19:51.549 --> 02:19:52.817
SURE PEOPLE ARE BECAUSE I HEAR.

02:19:52.884 --> 02:19:54.452
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THINGS THAT

02:19:54.519 --> 02:19:56.988
THAT WE KNOW WORK. AND PEOPLE

02:19:57.055 --> 02:19:57.689
DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO

02:19:57.756 --> 02:19:59.357
IMPLEMENT THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT I

02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:01.326
WE KNOW THE SCHOOLS HAVE TOO

02:20:01.393 --> 02:20:03.461
MANY BRANDON TEACHERS. WE KNOW

02:20:03.528 --> 02:20:05.130
THAT. TOO MANY AND EXPERIENCED

02:20:05.196 --> 02:20:09.033
TEACHERS. AND THE SOLUTION IS

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:10.869
FAIRLY SIMPLE. YOU HAVE TO MIX

02:20:10.935 --> 02:20:12.537
UP THE SCHOOLS. AND YOU HAVE

02:20:12.604 --> 02:20:14.339
THE COURAGE. TO PUT TO PUT

02:20:14.405 --> 02:20:15.707
PEOPLE WITH A NEEDED IN SCHOOLS

02:20:15.774 --> 02:20:18.209
AND- AND YOU CAN DO THAT. BY

02:20:18.276 --> 02:20:22.046
STATE LAW YOU CAN BE THERE. BUT

02:20:22.113 --> 02:20:22.847
WE DON'T OF THE COURAGE. AND

02:20:22.914 --> 02:20:24.582
THE SO THAT'S MY MADE BECAUSE-

02:20:24.649 --> 02:20:26.885
AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND GET

02:20:26.951 --> 02:20:28.386
THIS. HE UNVEILED. AND WE GET

02:20:28.453 --> 02:20:31.189
THIS DONE RIGHT. AND WE CAN

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:31.923
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:33.057
THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:34.592
GONNA BE WOULD WE EVER HAVE THE

02:20:34.659 --> 02:20:36.661
COURAGE TO REALLY EDUCATE THE

02:20:36.728 --> 02:20:40.198
CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE

02:20:40.265 --> 02:20:41.900
KEEP CHANGING THE STORY EVERY

02:20:41.966 --> 02:20:45.870
DAY AND I SEE KIDS WHO SPENDING

02:20:45.937 --> 02:20:46.738
FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS OF THAT

02:20:46.805 --> 02:20:49.574
LONGER IN OUR SCHOOLS AND NOT

02:20:49.641 --> 02:20:51.876
GETTING THAT MUCH BETTER. AND

02:20:51.943 --> 02:20:53.144
WE KNOW THE END RESULT IS KIND

02:20:53.211 --> 02:20:54.679
OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:56.014
OBVIOUSLY THE STORY OF AFRICAN

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:58.082
AMERICAN KIDS IN CALIFORNIA IS

02:20:58.149 --> 02:20:59.918
TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. TOTALLY

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:01.452
UNACCEPTABLE IN TERMS OF THE

02:21:01.519 --> 02:21:03.521
CONTINUED FAILURE AND THE AND

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:04.556
THE CHIEF MEANT GAP THAT JUST

02:21:04.622 --> 02:21:06.558
SEEMS TO BE PERSISTENT AND

02:21:06.624 --> 02:21:09.994
NEVER CHANGING. AND EVERY YEAR

02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:11.362
IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS IS ALWAYS

02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:13.231
SOMETHING NEW COMES UP THAT'S

02:21:13.298 --> 02:21:17.001
TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND SO I

02:21:17.068 --> 02:21:19.404
APPRECIATE EVERYBODY COMING I

02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:20.839

THESE ISSUES- BUT I KEEP ASKING

02:21:25.343 --> 02:21:26.144

02:21:26.211 --> 02:21:30.048
COURAGE TO A FOR CHILDREN AND

02:21:30.114 --> 02:21:31.816
