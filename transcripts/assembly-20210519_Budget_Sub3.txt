THANK G. DO YOU DO YOU ASK YOUR TO OUR HEARING I THINK YOU TO SOME OF YOUR- CHIEF IF YOU- HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF- UGH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFITS QUESTION YOU COULD TO START ANSWER NOW IF YOU LIKE. CERTAINLY THANK YOU AND AGAIN- THANK YOU FOR HEARING- THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT THIS MORNING- AB- THIRTY EIGHT IMPLEMENTATION AGAIN MY NAME'S TOM PORTER I AM- CALIFORNIA OR A DIRECTOR AND FIRE CHIEF. ALONG WITH ME I HAVE- THAT- ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR DANIEL BERGER LAMPS FROM OUR FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE- YOU WILL BE GIVING THE BULK OF OUR OUR- RESPONSE. AND I JUST WANTED TO START OUT BY SAYING- THAT WE- OR- THROUGH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL- IN FRONT OF YOU- WE'RE LOOKING TO- AND THE STAFF NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. THE ELEMENTS OF AB THIRTY EIGHT. THAT REQUIRE- WHEN REAL PROPERTY IS SOLD- THAT IT MEETS THE FIRE PROTECTION STANDARDS FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE. ARE UPON THAT TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP. AND SO MUCH CHEAPER LAPSED- YEARS OUR- ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THIS PROGRAM AND I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT HE WILL GIVE. THE TESTIMONY THAT I BELIEVE ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS THAT- THAT WERE ASKED BY- MEMBER BENNETT AND- AND THEN STAFF. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT WELL THEY YOU AND YOU- IN GOOD THAT BLOOM OF THE CAN- AS MANY ANYWHERE LANDIS'S DEPUTY RECTOR WITH CAL FIRE I JUST A QUICK REMINDER ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY EIGHT AS A COMPONENT OF IT REQUIRE SELLERS. OF HOMES WITHIN THE HIGH AND VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES A TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION- THAT THEIR PROPERTY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FENCE WILL SPACE REQUIREMENTS OUR REQUEST THAT WE BROUGHT FORWARD TO YOU ADDRESSES THE INCREASED WORKLOAD DRIVEN BY THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS. APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA OR CAL FIRE'S JURISDICTION- IS CLASSIFIED IN ONE OF THESE TWO ZONES ARE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND WE PERFORMED A DETAILED WORKLOAD ANALYSIS- BASED ON AVERAGE HOME SALES IN CALIFORNIA PROPORTIONAL TO THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA I WE ESTIMATE THAT. JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES I WILL BE SOLD I EACH YEAR WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION REQUIREMENT INDEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION TO DEMONSTRATE THAT CAN REQUIRED COMPLIANCE- WITH THESE NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. NOW THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ARE RAISED A REGARDING IMPOSING A FEE FOR THESE INSPECTIONS AND EVEN POSSIBLY TO FIND WORK ACT FOR US TO CLEAR OF VEGETATION FOR HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE ODD NON COMPLIANT- WE APPRECIATE TO A VERY MUCH OF THIS DISCUSSION- BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE- THAT IS NECESSARY AT THIS TIME FOR SEVERAL REASONS- FIRST. OUR BASE DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM HAS FOUND GREATEST COMPLIANCE THROUGH EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH ARE INSPECTORS SECOND WALK HOMEOWNERS THROUGH THE EASY STEPS ARE THAT IT TAKES TO GAIN COMPLIANCE AND IT'S PART OF HER JOB TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. TO THE HOMEOWNERS THAT REALLY EXPLAINS WHY IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR THE HOMEOWNER TO MAINTAIN DEFENSIBLE SPRAYS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN HOME- AND TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILY. YEAH IN FACT WE FIND THAT AFTER THESE EDUCATIONAL INSPECTIONS WE ACHIEVE A VERY HIGH COMPLIANCE RATES. IN THE PROGRAM BEFORE YOU TODAY A HOMEOWNER IS MOTIVATED TO SELL THEIR HOME- SO WE FEEL THAT. COMPLIANCE IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE RELATIVELY HIGH I- UPON OUR INSPECTION THESE NEED A REALIST TO SLOW. INSPECTIONS LASTLY THE COST IN RESOURCES TO ADMINISTER A NEW FEE PROGRAM WE BELIEVE. OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS GAINED BY THE WORK THAT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PERFORM. AND SO BASED ON OUR COMPLIANCE RATES BASED ON THE COST TO CONTRACT- FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORK- WHICH COULD EASILY RUN BY THE WAY ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AVERAGE- THAT WOULD ADD TO THE COST TO SELL A HOME- IF THE HOME HAD DEAD TREES FOR EXAMPLE- THAT NUMBER COULD LIKELY INCREASED OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- THE AGAIN THESE COSTS- WOULD BE IF THE STATE WAS TO IMPOSE A FEE. AND FOR US TO PERFORM THE WORK AND THE COST REALLY JUST DON'T PENCIL OUT. ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND HAVE AN ANSWER- ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. I APPRECIATE THE BACKGROUND ON THIS. AND WITH IT BEING LIMITED TO WHEN PROPERTIES ARE ARE BEING TRANSFERRED IN TERMS OF OWNERSHIP I THINK THAT I WILL AGREE WITH YOU THAT COMPLIANCE WILL BE MUCH HIGHER- DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT- DOWN THE ROAD WE WILL HAVE A- COMPLIANCE PROGRAM SIMPLY BECAUSE A FIRE RISK- AND TO. GET SOME KIND OF ANNUAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. WE ALREADY HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY- TO DO WORK FOR ON HOMEOWNERS THAT THEY DON'T DO THE WORK AS I MENTIONED IT'S A COSTLY. VENTURE THAT WE REALLY DON'T DO AN OVERALL WHEN WE SIMPLY GO OUT AND TALK TO HOMEOWNERS AND EDUCATE THEM WE TRULY DO FIND THAT THEY'RE MORE MOTIVATED- THEN OUR REQUIREMENTS ARE TO CLEAR THEIR VEGETATION YOU KNOW ALL THE FIRES. OVER THE LAST YEARS AND THE- TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY WILDFIRES MOST OF THE HOMEOWNERS THAT WE NEED TO IN FACT PROBABLY ALMOST ALL OF THEM. ARE VERY MOTIVATED TO SAVE THEIR HOME AND DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO ENSURE THAT THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND SO THAT'S WHERE REALLY OUR EDUCATIONAL INSPECTIONS- GET US I THINK IT WHICH EVEN THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT. AND REALLY- YOU KNOW TO BETTER PROTECT THE COMMUNITY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME DO WE NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE L. A. O. OR YOU. OKAY GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATIONS- MISS CARSON THANK YOU FOR STANDING BY WILL PROCEED NOW TO ISSUE TOO. AND THAT IS THE PRESENTATION ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSAL ON CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE. A FIVE FOOT- PEOPLE ON OUR PANEL SERGIO AGUILAR- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BRYAN FULLER ALSO WITH- AND ELIZABETH YURI ALSO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND RACHEL HOURS AND BRIAN BROWN WITH THE L. A. L. IT'S A GOOD MORNING IN TURN MEMBERS SIR DRIVER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO THEY ARE VERY SIMPLE GOALS WITHIN THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGE PACKAGE THAT WILL BE COVERING A PART OF THIS AGENDA ITEM. ALSO ROUGHLY NOTING THAT THE COMBINATION OF THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FEE REVENUES AND THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL SUPPORT REALLY HAS PROVIDED A PRETTY HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S CLIMB INITIATIVES. AND OVERALL WHEN COMBINED WITH THE INVESTMENTS UP FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE MAYOR VISION FOR WAS A TOTAL OF ABOUT ELEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION. IN INVESTMENTS THAT ENHANCE THE STATE'S CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND ALSO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS SALTLICK BASICALLY HIGHLIGHTING THE WATER RESILIENCE AND GROUND INVESTMENTS AND I'LL PASS IT ON TO MY OTHER COLLEAGUES FOR A COUPLE OF THE OTHER. MAJOR COMPONENTS AS PART OF THIS PACKAGE SO. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE WATER DOING PORTFOLIO WHICH OUTLINES THE YOU KNOW A COPPER THE STRATEGY AND OVER A HUNDRED ACTIONS THAT ENABLE CALIFORNIA'S WATER. WEIGHT JUST TO INCREASING TEMPERATURES TO AYE SHRINKING SNOWPACK WRITING FEE LEVELS AND ALSO MORE INTENSE AND FREQUENT DROUGHTS AND AFTER TO EXCEPTIONALLY DRY WINTERS CALIFORNIA IS ONCE AGAIN EXPERIENCING DROUGHT CONDITIONS. SO WE ARE USING YOU KNOW A LESSONS LEARNED FOR FROM PREVIOUS TRAVEL AND A WHOLE-GOVERNMENT APPROACH- THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY ISSUED A- STATE OF EMERGENCY IN FORTY ONE COUNTIES REPRESENTING YOU KNOW PROBABLY 30% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. AND IS PART OF THAT DROP PROCLAMATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTED THE STATE AGENCIES TO RESPOND AND PREPARE IN VARIOUS WAYS AND ALSO INCLUDE. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND SUPPORT IN IN THE MAYOR VISION SO CONSISTENT WITH THE WATER PORTFOLIO AND THE GOVERNOR'S DROUGHT PROCLAMATION THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES FOUR POINT THREE FIVE BILLION OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. TO ADVANCE THE STATE WATER RESILIENCE AND ALSO SUPPORT- DROUGHT PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE AS THOSE EVEN VESTMENTS BUILD UPON THE- SEVEN HUNDRED FIVE IN FIFTY SEVEN MILLION INCLUDED IN THERE OVER BUDGET. FOR A TOTAL PASS OF A FIVE POINT ONE BILL. IN PROPOSED WATER GOING TO BE. I JUST TO COVER A KIND OF A COUPLE HIGH LEVELS OF THE INVESTMENT IN THE WATER RESILIENCE PACKAGE ABOUT TWO POINT SIX BILLION- SUPPORT PROVIDING ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. BUILDING WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND ALSO AN IMPROVING FLOOD PROTECTION- CLOSE TO ONE BILLION- HELP SUPPORT IMMEDIATE DROUGHT SUPPORT. AND THEN ALSO ENABLES IT IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING. AND THEN THERE'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION FOR NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS TO HELP RESTORE FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT. RECONNECTING WILDLIFE CORRIDORS AND ALSO REMOVING BARRIERS TO FISH PASSAGE- SO WITH THAT BACK OVER THE HIGH LEVEL THE WATER RESILIENCE COMPONENTS OF THE CLIENT PACKAGE.

ANY QUESTIONS AND I BROKE FROM THE APARTMENT AVAILABLE TO FIELD QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU- MS ELLERS AND MISTER BROWN YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THESE PROPOSALS. HI YES GOOD MORNING RACHEL IT WAS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO AS YOU HEARD THERE'S ONE PACKAGE THAT'S CALLED THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE BUT REALLY THERE ARE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PACKAGES AND PROPOSALS THAT ARE. SHOULD YOU SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS AB RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE SO- THAT MAKES THINGS A LITTLE COMPLICATED FOR YOU BUT WE REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THESE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE TOGETHER AND NOT ISOLATE IT- AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF YOUR PRIORITIES AND INTENTIONS ARE REFLECTED ACROSS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PACKAGES. SOME OF THE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU ARE CONTINUATIONS ARE EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEM IN THE CLIMATE PACKAGE IN PARTICULAR THAT TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES URBAN GREENING THESE ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS BUT THERE ARE MANY NEED BRAND NEW INITIATIVES ACROSS THESE PACKAGES BRAND NEW PROGRAMS- ABOUT AS AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IS RELATIVELY LIMITED THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN GREAT ABOUT RESPONDING BUT- IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THERE'S NOT A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK BEING PROPOSED FOR THESE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO- PROVIDE GUIDANCE OVER HOW FUNDS SHOULD BE PRIORITISED WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE COMPETITIVE GRANTS OR STATE SELECTED PROJECTS- YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT I BONTA THAT YOU WOULD PUT TOGETHER THINK OF HOW MUCH OF A FRAMEWORK YOU USUALLY WORK ON- TO GUIDE THE EXPENDITURES OF A BOND THIS IS SORT OF LIKE MULTIPLE BONDS COMING TOGETHER WITHOUT THAT FRAMEWORK. SO GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SPENDING IN A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT TAKING A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME AND DEFERRING SOME OF THESE DECISIONS ESPECIALLY AS YOU'RE WORKING ACROSS ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PACKAGES- INTO LATER IN THE SUMMER THAT COULD GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE- PROPOSALS AND- AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. IS INTENDING. ALL TO CRAFT STATUTES LINK AND PER. THAT EXTRA KIND OF BILL AND- AND OVER OVER EMPLOYMENT. D. AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PACKAGES REFLECT YOUR LIFE. PRIORITIES FOR A- THAT SOME OF THE BOND PROPOSALS THAT I BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE LIKE. ON BOTH PS. AND THE SENATE HOUSE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE RESPONSE AND I AM FOR OUR LOCAL PLANNING AND- LOCAL PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION THEN THE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU. SO THAT'S JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF PLACES WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES MIGHT DIFFER- SO IT'S A LOT TO WORKING WITH- AND NOT A LOT OF TIME BEFORE THE DEADLINE I AM BUT- BUT- A LOT OF. AND IMPORTANT- THAT AND- WHAT KIND OF AS WAS MY- REALLY UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENTS HERE SO TAKING TIME MAKES SENSE THANKS. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. NO THINKING MEDICATING- THE DEALERS COVERED IT- BUT- MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ON ANY OF THE PACKAGES THANK YOU- FOR YOUR- IS A LAWYER SO. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- A GLOOMY LET ME START BY SAYING I APPRECIATE TAKE YOUR SUGGESTION THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO STEP BACK AND TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH SOME OF THESE ITEMS GIVEN THE- PRESS OF TIME AND WE HAVE. I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL THE LUXURY OF DOING THAT- WITH WITH SOME OF THESE FUNDS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- WITHOUT SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS THE EXPENDITURES DON'T HAVE TO BE AGAIN UNTIL- SOMETIME IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IS THAT CORRECT. YES THAT'S CORRECT IT IS- AND USUAL IN SOME WAYS THAT WE HAVE THIS MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY OVER HOW TO SPEND IT AND THEN WE HAVE THE EXTENT EXTENDED TIMELINE TO SPEND IT SO YEAH YOU DO YOU DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME THAT MIGHT BE TYPICAL OF SOME FEDERAL GRANTS AND- AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT OUR- A DECISION MAKING PROCESS- ARE WE- ABLE. TO WAIT THAT THAT LONG A TIME TO ACTUALLY ALLOCATE THE FUNDS. YEAH AND YOU CAN ALLOCATE- DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OVER DIFFERENT YEARS TO IF YOU WANT IF YOU HAVE SOME HIGH PRIORITIES YOU WANTED TO ADDRESS THIS YEAR YOU CAN ALLOCATE SOME O THE FUNDS AND THEN HOLD ON TO THE REST FOR FUTURE YEARS. SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE PACKAGE IS THE HEAD OF BEFORE YOU. THERE'S ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR DRINKING WATER FUNDS AS PART OF THE WATER PACKAGE THERE'S ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE WATER BOARD TO ADDRESS WATER REARRANGES. SO SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE PRETTY PRESSING LIKE LIKE THE WATER DEBT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT MOVING ON MORE QUICKLY. BUT ACTIVITIES LIKE BIG WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT MAYBE YOU WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND- A SPEAKING OF- WATER- INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES ONE POINT THREE BILLION FOR DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME INDICATION OF HOW THIS. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING. WOULD BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS- AND STAFF RESOURCES. YES SIR DRIVE OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND JUST TO CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT ON ON THE- FEDERAL ARE BOTH FUNDING DEADLINE SO IT HAS TO BE ENCUMBERED. BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THEN TRULY YOU LIQUIDATED BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT OF THE OPPOSITE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TIME ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO GET THOSE PROJECTS OUT BECAUSE- HAVE MISSED A LETTER SAID YOU KNOW. THESE ARE LARGE PROJECT BECAUSE THEY TAKE A LONG TIME TO BUILD AND GET OUT SO IF WE ACTUALLY DON'T USE THAT FUNDING WE LOSE IT IT GOES BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THERE'S- THERE IS ACTUALLY. A SIGNIFICANT URGENCY TO PROCREATE APP FINDING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A DEPARTMENTS STARTED GETTING THE PROJECT OUT THE DOOR AND SPEND IT BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU DON'T SPEND WE HAVE TO REVERT IT BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- SO JUST TO CLARIFY ON THAT POINT. AND THEN SAT DOWN THE ONE POINT THREE POSSO IT BE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE- WASTE WATER RELATED ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT THAT WOULD BE DRINKING WATER RELATED AND THEN I GENERALLY LIKE WE LIKE WE DO FOR BONDS YOU KNOW WE'RE AUTHORIZING ABOUT FIVE PERCENT. TO BE SPENT ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND SO- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE OUR PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE- FUNDED INVOLVED BEFORE AND WE'RE STRUCTURING THE- KIND OF THE PROGRAM'S VERY SIMILARLY- AND SO I JUST KIND OF KNOW THAT SO IT'S CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE'VE- IMPLEMENTED THESE PROGRAMS BEFORE. THERE'S A TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. ALLOCATED FOR A P. FAST CLEAN UP. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS OF THE- OF THE- PROBLEM IS MUCH LARGER THAN A TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS SO WHY IS THE AMOUNT SOLO. YES ALSO- AND YOU KNOW AS WATER WORK ACT ALSO ON THE LINE TO. PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION BUT THERE'S A KIND OF A NEW YOU KNOW EMERGING- KIND OF CHEMICAL THAT IT'S STILL BEING ANALYZED AND SO I UNITED WE THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD A GOOD IT ONE TIME INVESTMENT- IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING AND WATER RESILIENCE BUT NOT SURE IF- ANYBODY FROM THE WATER BORDER OR THE AGENCY HAS. MORE AT. TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE WATER BOARD TO WHO CAN ADD COMMENTS ON THAT. GOING ONCE. IT SEEMS LIKE- BECAUSE- THE WORLD WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN ANSWER ON THAT QUESTION- MISTER BENNETT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BETTER I THINK YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO. YOUR BOTTOM OF. OVERALL I CERTAINLY- PROPITIATE ALL THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE MOVED FORWARD HERE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT LIKE TO SAY THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS IS THAT- THIS IS. IT IN MANY WAYS IT'S HARDER TO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY QUICKLY WELL- WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A TIGHT BUDGET THERE IS THAT THAT DISCIPLINE THAT COMES WITH A TIGHT BUDGET- AND- I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO MOVE UP QUICKLY AND AT THE SAME TIME- PAY ATTENTION TO SO MANY NEEDS THAT WE HAVE. IN PARTICULAR I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR STAFF HAS CERTAINLY. MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO LISTEN TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY- MEMBERS- PARTICULARLY IN THIS COMMITTEE- AND I'LL I'LL POINT OUT A FEW OF THOSE SAYS THAT AS I MAKE SOME AS I ASK SOME QUESTIONS AND MAKE SOME COMMENTS BUT- IN TERMS OF SEA LEVEL RISE- FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS. I THINK IS IT GOING TO BE AN ONGOING NEED FOR US WITH THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS THAT WE HAVE- I HAVE A PARTICULAR QUESTION ABOUT THE COASTAL COMMISSION BECAUSE COMMISSION IS. HEAVILY INVOLVED IN MANY CHALLENGES DEALING WITH- THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OF THE IMPACTS ON COASTAL ACCESS FOR OUR CITIZENS. THERE BUDGET WAS CUT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE'S BY 5% THOSE. THOSE BUDGET CUTS HAVE NOT BEEN RESTORED AND SMALL AGENCIES MY EXPERIENCE IS IT IS THAT THOSE. PERCENTAGE CUTS ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ADJUST TO- IS IT IS THERE. A REASON WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY FUNDING AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S BEEN NO FUNDING INCREASE FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION RELATIVE TO OTHER AGENCIES. AND THE COST COMMISSION IS VERY INVOLVED IN. MAKING IMPROVEMENTS AT THE COAST WITH SOME OF THE GRANT PROGRAM SIX ADDRESS I'M NOT JUST A REGULATIONS SO COULD TO COULD ANYBODY ADDRESS. AT ONE FOR ME AT THE THIS POINT TIME. SO SURGERY. HOW DO THAT IN ON THIS- AND THEN ALSO YOU PASS IT ON TO MY RESEARCH AGENCY- COLLEAGUES ON THE- PROBLEM YOU KNOW SEALEVEL RISE COMPONENTS OF THE CLIMATE PACKAGE- SO YOU KNOW A LOT LIKE- LIKE ME EITHER AGENCIES AND THERE WERE. 5% YOU KNOW EFFICIENCY TARGETS- THAT THAT WERE INCLUDED- ANKLE TO COMMISSION WAS ALSO PART OF THAT WHERE- IT'S KIND OF GEARED TOWARDS- MAKING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES- WITHIN GOVERNMENT SO THERE WERE- YOU KNOW SO FIVE PERCENT- FROM THAT. I WILL NOTE THAT THERE IS FUNDING FROM- CAP AND TRADE- FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION SO FOR THIS- NEXUS WE ARE FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WHICH SUPPORTS THEIR WORK ON SEA LEVEL RISE- WE HAD INITIALLY INCLUDED OPERABLE WHAT PART OF OVERLY ACTION THAT I WAS NOT ADOPTED. SO WHAT WE DID WE HAD SHIFTED THE AMOUNTS THAT WAS NOT ADOPTED IN EARLY ACTION TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET CASTLE THERE'S ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THERE THAT. WOULD GO TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION FOR THIS NEXT UPCOMING YEAR- TO THE FOR A LOT OF THEIR- KIND OF THE C. C. LEVEL RISE EFFORTS THAT ARE FUNDED BY CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. AND THERE'S THE YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENTS- IN SEA LEVEL RISE- WHICH- MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE AGENCY COULD YOU COULD SPEAK TO ADVOCATES SPEAK TO THE COLLABORATION THEY HAVE. WITH THE- COASTAL COMMISSION ON THAT EVER. THANK MUCH SERGIO B. JUST. A YOU PROCEED WITH THE ANSWER. I THE- IS. TO FUNDING FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION- AND- IF YOU AS YOU RESPOND. TO THE QUESTION NOW. IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN HOW THE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED. TO INTEGRATE WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND DO ADDITIONAL WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING. THANK YOU FOR FOLLOWING UP. THANK YOU FOR THAT FOLLOW UP TO THE- KAREN ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND FOR PRESIDING OVER THIS HEARING I'M WAY CROAK WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES SECRETARY- FIRST OF ALL HAS GONE UP. MAYBE STATE THE OBVIOUS WHICH IS WE SHARE YOUR PRIORITY TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND INVESTMENTS IN OUR PROTECTING CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES IN NATURAL PLACES AGAINST THE LEVEL RISE AND IN COASTAL INUNDATION- BEFORE I GET TO THE POINT AROUND THE TYPICALLY THE COASTAL COMMISSION WERE REALLY EXCITED WITH THE TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL. I AS IT RELATES TO IMPORTANT THINGS WE KNOW NEED TO HAPPEN ON THE COAST TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR COASTAL WETLAND RESTORATION WHICH OF COURSE ABSORB OUR STORM SURGE AND SEA LEVEL RISE AND NATURE BASED SOLUTION TO HELP ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE AND THEN OVER ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ENABLE THE STATE PARK SYSTEM. TO IMPLEMENT THEIR- UPDATED SEALEVEL RISE ACTION PLAN. COASTAL COMMITTEE IS ABSOLUTELY BEEN A LEADER WITHIN OUR ADMINISTRATION AND OUR AGENCY- I'M HELPING BRING DISPARATE OUTSIDE ENTITIES TOGETHER WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT TO REALLY GET ON THE SAME PAGE WITH WHAT WE NEED TO DO. I'M THE LEVEL RIGHTS WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS OBVIOUSLY REQUIRED THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION ON A PERMIT BY PERMIT BASIS ADDRESSED THE ISSUE YOU WANT A MORE HOLISTIC PROACTIVE APPROACH. SO OUR AGENCY AND OTHER AGENCIES WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION OF DEVELOPED. I'M JUST OUTLINED SET OF PRINCIPLES. PLANNING PRINTABLES ON SEALEVEL RISE THAT'S GOING TO GUIDE OUR OUR INVESTMENTS MOVING FORWARD SO I DO THINK THAT THE POINT OF PROGRESS. SERGIO CAN CORRECT ME BUT I BELIEVE THAT COASTAL COMMISSION IS MUCH LIKE OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN OUR AGENCY IN ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT WHERE- BECAUSE WE ARE OVER TIME HAVE A DEMONSTRATE A- OUR SYSTEMIC- OR SORT OF I'M GOING DEFICIT IN OUR ON GOING GENERAL FUND- WE HAVEN'T- PLUS STOP- BUDGETS WITHIN THE COASTAL COMMISSION OR OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN OUR AGENCY AND AS YOU POINT OUT THOSE. THOSE OP ADDITIONS THE CUTS ARE ARE. ARE REMAIN IN PLACE- WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON HOW DO WE SPEND THIS ONE TIME FUNDING. I IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T- EXTEND OUR GENERAL FUND LIABILITY. BUT THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THAT ON SEA LEVEL RISE AND OTHER. CLIMATE DRIVEN THREATS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO. INVEST MORE OVER TIME- BOTH IN ONE TIME AND PROBABLY IN THE CAPACITY OF OUR ENTITIES WITHIN OUR AGENCY. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE- AND I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ONE TIME FUNDING AND THE ON GOING CHALLENGES- THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF THAT FUNDING I THINK GIVEN THE CRISIS AND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. MY EXPERIENCE COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS AT THE COAST COMMISSION SEEMS TO BE SORT OF AT THE APEX OF ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO WELL THEN WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE CAUSE OF COMMISSION SAYSENOUGH THAT. IN AND SO AS YOU SAID THEY PLAY REALLY PIVOTAL ROLE FOR ALL OF THESE AGENCIES ULTIMATELY- COMING TOGETHER SO IF THERE WAS A WAY TO TAKE SOME ONE TIME MONEY AND STRETCH IT OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS YOU KNOW- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS STRETCHED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS TO HELP WITH ALL OF THIS. FAST MOVING IMPLEMENTATION EXCITER IT STRIKES ME AS A AS I I'M JUST THROWING OUT AN EXAMPLE OF THE NEED TO DISTRACT ME AS A AS A REASONABLE EXAMPLE GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW SOME OTHER AGENCIES ARE RIVAS RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT FUNDING INCREASES. AND I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH INTERACTION WITH BECAUSE I JUST SEE THAT HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE OTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT IS COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT- CONSISTENTLY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO BE TO WORK WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME WOULD IT WOULD THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR STAFF TO ANALYZE- PROJECTS AND- YOU KNOWHOW MUCH ABILITY TO CAUSE COMMISSION STAFF HAVE HAVE IME TO DO THAT. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE AT AND IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS A RESPONSE ON THAT I'M GOING TO JUMP TO SOME OTHER TOPICS BUT- IF SOMEBODY WANTS IF WE WANT TO STAY ON COSTA COMMISSION. IF ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING ELSE ON THAT I'M HAPPY TO HOLD OFF THEIR- ALL JUST ADDED A QUICK COMMENT- IF YOU DON'T MIND IS A FORMER COASTAL COMMISSIONER- THE COASTAL COMMISSION- IS INTEGRAL TO ALL THESE EFFORTS AROUND TO C. LEVEL RISE. AND I JOIN YOU- DIRECTOR CRAWFORD AND- CELEBRATING THE TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL HERE I THINK IT'S GREAT- BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT- OVER THE YEARS THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN- A YEAR AFTER YEAR- HAD TO KIND OF BEG FOR CRUMBS- WHEN IT COMES TO- TO. FUNDING SO WHEN YOU ADD THAT THE 5% EFFICIENCY- A CIRCUMSTANCE- THAT PUTS IT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THEM TO DO THE JOB THAT THEY ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED TO DO- WITH ESSENTIALLY LESS AND LESS AND FEWER AND FEWER RESOURCES- AND THEN ADD TO THAT THESE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK WE ALL AGREE- AND- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET THE WORK DONE AND WE KNOW THAT WE WANT EVERYBODY TO BE COLLABORATING GETTING THIS WORKED OUT SO. TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL COMMENTS- FOR YOU- AND YOU HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL POINTS OKAY AND THEN WE HAVE- IS RIVAS WAITING. AND IT HERE FOR COMMENTS ON KANNST COMMISSION AND SHE PREFERS TO GO NOW THAT'S FINE BUT- I THINK SHE'S ON TOP OF ANOTHER TOPIC GREAT- IF IS THERE MORE DETAIL ON THE BIOMASS TO HYDROGEN AND BIOFUELS- PILOT- I'M AT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE S. AS WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD. AT THAT MOMENT I'LL TALK ABOUT HYDROGEN AND IN INTO CONCEPTS- AND THE THAT IS WHEN IT COMES TO. CHARGING STATIONS AND- THEN WE HAVE THESE OTHER HYDROGEN THAT- YOU KNOW PILOT PROGRAM PROGRAMS OUT THERE ARE BIOMASS TO HYDROGEN JUST IN TERMS OF CREATING IT. SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT NOW WE ARE. INVESTING SIGNIFICANT FUNDS INTO THE EEVEE CHARGING STATIONS WHICH I COMPLETELY SUPPORT- MY BELIEF IS FOR. THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO IN CALIFORNIA IS TO DO THE SAME THING THAT THEY'RE DOING IN EUROPE WHICH IS TRYING TO. HAVE THE RESILIENCY OF BOTH HYDROGEN AND ELECTRICITY- AS THE OPTIONS FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE- IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE- WE NEED TO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT HYGIENE MOVING FORWARD ALSO. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HYDROGEN NOT BEING A 100% CLEAN YET. AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE ELECTRICITY WERE USING FOR ELECTRICITY CHARGING STATIONS IS ALSO NOT A 100% CLEAN YET- SO I WOULD SUPPORT POLICIES THAT WOULD SAY THEY BOTH NEED TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT. RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY. AT WHEN THE TIME COMES. WHEN THAT IS SHOULD BE ON THE SAME SCHEDULE IN TERMS OF NEEDING TO BE THERE- BUT FOR US TO HOLD BACK ON GETTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE GOING FOR HYDROGEN- DOESN'T- DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IF WE SAY HEY WE WANT TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THERE'S NOT SUPPORT FOR THE INSTRUCTION TELL HAD REGION IS A 100% CLEAN. BECAUSE IF THAT WAS THE CASE WE WOULD BE DOING E. V. THAT STRUCTURE ALSO. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID- HE YOU KNOW IT HI I AM I WOULD LIKE TO- SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME POLICIES THAT. SUPPORT BOTH PUT THEM BOTH ON THE SAME KIND OF TIME FRAME- IN TERMS OF WHEN THEY HAVE TO GET TO A 100% GREEN BUT NOT DISADVANTAGE ONE OVER THE OTHER- WHILE THEY'RE WAITING TO GET THEIR- BECAUSE WE- CERTAINLY WITH TRUCKS. AND BUSES HYDROGEN. I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES IS A IS A GOOD SOLUTION- IT SEEMS TO ME WE SHOULDN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES IT'S ALSO STILL. A VIABLE OPTION- PARTICULARLY WITH THE LOWER LIFE CYCLE COST EXTRATERRESTRIAL AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO ADVANTAGE ONE OVER THE OTHERS WILL TRY TO MAKE SURE WE STAY RESILIENT OF BOTH OF THOSE SO- THE ON THE BIOMASS ARE THERE ANY MORE DETAILS ON THE- BIOMASS TO HYDROGEN BIOFUELS PILOT- AND- IS THERE AN EFFORT TO ENSURE- THAT WERE COMING UP WITH A GAME PLAN FOR- BOTH. THE ENERGY SOURCE IS BEING- CLEAN AT THE SAME TIME AND BOTH OF THEM GETTING- ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGING STATIONS GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AGAIN WAIT CRAWFORD I'LL TURN IT OVER IN A MOMENT OF TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO CAN ANSWER SPECIFIC ON THAT I'M THE PROPOSED PROJECT ALLOCATION BUT I'LL JUST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHTS ON ON HYDROGEN WE RECOGNIZE HYDROGEN'S IMPORTANCE FOR CALIFORNIA IN REACHING OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL- THERE WILL BE APPLICATIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE LIQUID FUELS SO THINK SHIPS AND PLANES AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS SEES. AND CLEAN HYDROGEN IS OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL TO. MAINTAINING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THOSE SECTORS WHILE ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY SO REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHTS I'M GONNA TURN INTO A COLLIE THAT CAN MORE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED THE QUESTION ON THAT ARE PROPOSED ALLOCATION. HI GOOD MORNING THIS IS CANON RITUAL- DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FILM TRANSPORTATION DIVISION OKAY. YES OKAY GREAT YEAH SO OF THE THAT PACKAGE ON THE HYDROGEN SIDE WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND- A GENERAL PUSH TO CLOSE THE LIGHT DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE GAP OF THAT WILL BE ABOUT THE IN BOTH ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN TO CLOSE THAT GAP OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES- BOTH ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN ARE VERY MUCH ELIGIBLE FOR THAT IT'S OFFER CONSUMER DRIVEN SO WE CAN REALLY GET HUNDRED UPTAKE BY TRANSIT AGENCIES AS WELL AS ELECTRIC- ELECTRIC BOX UPTAKE BY TRANSIT AGENCIES. SIMILARLY ON THAT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION BAHT TARGETED HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES- GREAT TRUCK TRANSIT AND SCHOOL BOTH ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT AS WELL BONTA YET WE SHARE YOUR SENTIMENT THAT WE NEED TO SET THE FOR BOTH ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN I WILL NOTE THAT OF OUR PROPERTY ONE HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR IN THE CONTRACT PROTECTION PROGRAM WE'VE INVESTED TWENTY MILLION PER YEAR JUST ON THE PUBLIC HYDROGEN OXIDE AND I THINK WE'RE NOT GO TO THAT EVEN ON THE MEDIUM DUTY HOW DID YOU DECIDE. TO ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE GONE TO HYDROGEN- ALREADY AND WE SEE- LARGE INVESTMENTS. HAVE BEEN GOING FORWARD AS WELL. D. DO YOU KNOW THE DOWN INTO OF THE IN TERMS OF PASS REAR SIDE WHERE WE ARE WITH HYDROGEN CHARGING STATIONS VERSUS ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS. YEAH SO WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC ISSUES OUT THERE RIGHT NOW AND ABOUT FORTY NINE HYDROGEN STATIONS. AND SO- ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE WE ARE LAGGING- MORE SO AND SO- THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL GREATER INVESTMENT ELECTRIFIED WE APPROACH IT FROM A VERY DATA DRIVEN- PLACE. AND TO LOOK AT THEY GOT FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE LARGER GAP ON THE ELECTRIFIED. ON THE HUNDRED INSIDE- THERE'S ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TODAY. AND WERE EXPECTED TO REACH A HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED STATEMENT BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AT THAT POINT WE'LL HAVE PEELING CAPACITY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BLIGHTED HYDROGEN VEHICLES. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT WE LOOKED- ON THE DATA ANALYTICS IN THE LIGHT HE FIRED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SUPPORTING BOTH. BUT ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT CONSUMERS ARE ADOPTING AND I SIMILARLY ON THE MEDIA YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WE LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES DIFFERENT FLEETS THE CONTRACT ABOUT THE- DRAINAGE IN THE BY NATURE OF WHAT THEY'RE PREPARING. AND WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT THE THERE- AGAIN PHOTOELECTRIC AND HUNDRED AND- TO GET TO THEIR MISSION PETER. HE IF I COULD THAT I HAVE. THE DALLAS BAY ON. THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES BEING PURCHASED AND YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE SHORT QUITE FRANKLY WERE BEAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THERE WITH. BUT YOU KNOW. WHAT'S BOTTOM BUT THE- IF OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THE RESILIENCY OF TWO DIFFERENT ENERGY SOURCES THAT COULD HELP GET US TO CLEAN- WE HAVE A CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM AND THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE HYDROGEN CHARGING STATIONS PARTICULARLY- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE FIRST STARTING OUT IF I MEAN IF THEY'RE JUST VERY VERY FEW. A DIFFICULT TO GET THE PASSENGER VEHICLE SALES. TO GO UP- IT SEEMS THAT- IF WERE FORWARD THINKING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT SO THAT WE CAN THEN FIND OUT WHETHER THE CONSUMERS REALLY ARE WILLING TO EMBRACE THAT TECHNOLOGY. I DON'T KNOW AND- SO I AND I'M NOT SURE I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO ONLY USE THE ANALYSIS OF CURRENT NUMBER OF SALES BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET THE SALES UNTIL YOU CAN. TELL YOU HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE THAT WOULD MAKE SOMEBODY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT SO I HOPE WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT AS WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT MIX- AND YEAH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ABOUT THAT. WE MADE OUR GOAL I THINK JUST WE WILL BE BETTER OFF JUST JUST IT AND THEY'RE DOING THE SAME THING IN EUROPE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE BOTH OF THOSE- SOURCES- ALTAIR BEFORE BECAUSE OF THE- REDUNDANCY FACTOR. WHO WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH EITHER ONE OF THOSE SOURCES IN TERMS OF. TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES SIX CENTER THAT THAT THAT MAY COME FORWARD- AND LIFECYCLE COST AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. FINALLY I JUST A- WORD IT TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- I JUST WANT TO. LET THE- THE STAFF IN PARTICULAR AND THE ADMINISTRATION- I APPRECIATE THE TYING OF THE CAP ON THE FEES ON ELECTRIC BILLS. TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE BROUGHT UP HERE- IN THIS- COMMITTEE- ROOM- IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS- THAT IT'S BETTER FOR CALIFORNIA TO HAVE FEES TIED. TO INFLATIONARY INCREASES AND- YOU'VE DONE THAT HERE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER MULLIN DID YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION OR A SEPARATE QUESTION. ALRIGHT THEN WE'LL HAVE FIVE MINUTES READ THIS AND THEN YOU MISTER MOLOT. I AM VERY HAPPY THE INVESTMENT. ALL INVESTMENTS AND THE FOCUS ON EXTREME HEAT AND THIS MAY BUDGET REVISED- IT'S CLEAR THAT EXTREME HEAT IS HERE NOW AND I'M HAPPY THAT ADMINISTRATION- IS SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS WEATHER EVENT- BUT WHILE THE FUNDING DIRECTED TO THE CVC TO CREATE A PROGRAM OUT OF THE BILL PROGRAM IS A GOOD STEP. I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT WHOLE THING CLIMATE IMPACTS OF WILL NOT BE AS PRIORITIZED- YOU KNOW THE CC IS FOCUSED ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT DIRECTING FUNDING FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY BUT EXTREME HATE IS PERVASIVE IN HARMING COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE IN MY DISTRICT. YOU KNOW THIS FUNDING IS LIMITED SOLELY TO RESIDENTIAL UNITS TO REALLY DRAW DOWN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES- WELL I THINK TO REALLY DRAW DOWN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES IN IN AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHICH PROJECTS DO THAT IN ACHIEVE THAT GOAL- AND POTENTIALLY WORK WITH NGOS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND AND THEY CAN HELP IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS- SO THAT'S WHY I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN COMPLEMENT THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT THE C. E. C. AND CAN ALLOW OPR. TO WORK WITH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO DETERMINE THE GRANT PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP TO TAP INTO RESOURCES AND TO EMPOWER THEM TO IMPLEMENT THE EXTREME HEAT MEASURES THAT ARE BEST FOR THEM. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU MR MOHAN. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN NOT SURE IF MISTER SECRETARY IS STILL WITH US BUT IT WAS GOOD TO SEE HIM- I THINK THE- OPPORTUNITY EXISTS REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY TO- INVEST. IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND I HAD A- I GUESS JUST A COMMENT TO START ON RESILIENCE PLANNING AND THEN A QUESTION. FOR THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE- A CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM WHICH IS FIRST ON RESILIENCE PLANNING OF HAPPY TO SEE THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION BEING APPROPRIATED. I TO OPR ON ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE PLANNING GRANTS- I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY INCREASED IF WE WANT TO REALLY INCENTIVIZE- THE LOCALS TO DO THE APPROPRIATE ADAPTATION PLANNING JUST TO THE SCALE- THAT IS NEEDED- GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE SO WOULD LIKE TO SEE. A CONVERSATION AROUND- INCREASING THAT AMOUNT AND THEN JUST A QUESTION ON THE- CLEAN VEHICLE PROGRAM. THEY HAD THE- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. ACCELERATION DOES THE ADMINISTRATION PLAN. TO LIMIT THE C. B. R. P. TO ONLY LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS THE FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. OF F. P. L. THAT HAS BEEN- PUT INTO A LANGUAGE OTHER SOME CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT THAT IS SIMPLY TOO LIMITING. AND WOULD LIKE TO JUST GET A FEEL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING ON THAT. AND WHETHER THAT IS- WHETHER THERE ARE SOME. A POTENTIAL TO MOVE ON THAT. I THINK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WAS SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES BUT I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE SYDNEY BRIGUS IS ONLINE AT AND AT THE AIRPORT YOU CAN SPEAK TO THIS AS WELL. HI SICKENING FOR JUST SOME THAT DIVISION CHIEF FOR THE MOBILE SOURCE. CONTROL DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD CURRENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS TO LIMIT. AB SENIOR PETE TO. THE LOW MODERATE INCOME CONSUMERS THAT'S BELOW THE 4100% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL- AS YOU PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW A CURRENT SOURCE OF. OF CONVERSATION THAT I'M SURE WILL CONTINUE. I JUST WANT THAT ON THE RECORD THAT LOOK FOR TO THE CONVERSATION I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE INTENT THERE AND STEERING THAT THAT BENEFIT TO LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME- LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS BUT LOOK FOR TO UP CONVERSATION. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT THE QUESTION IS IT WE WERE ALL IN A DROUGHT AGAIN WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA THREE YEARS AGO WE DID A BIG GROWTH DROUGHT STUDY BUT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL FOR WATER AND NUMBER THREE PRESENTATION. THAT DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY SAY WATER STORAGES SAYS ADDRESS DRINKING WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND FLOOD PROTECTION CAN YOU ASSURE MYSELF FOR MY COLLEAGUES. IN THE- RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT THERE IS MONEY IN THERE FOR WATER STORAGE. AND IT PROBABLY COULD BE MISTER CRAWFORD. YEAH I THINK SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT STORAGE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUR DROUGHT RESILIENCE I'M GLAD TO REPORT THAT THE PROP ONE FIVE STATEWIDE GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND FUNDING THAT PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED AND RESULTING IN MORE STORAGE PROD PROJECTS. SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR POINT THERE IS FUNDING IN OUR PROPOSAL FOR STORAGE PROJECTS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE WE PROPOSED THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT TO HELP REGIONS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING SIGMAR FOR THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT. I MOVE TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER USE. WHAT WE ENVISION FOR THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE TO EXPAND STORAGE AND GROUNDWATER STORAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR RECHARGE BOB IN IN WINTERS AND WET WINTERS- INTO UNDERGROUND WATER STORAGE. SO OUR PORTION OF OUR OF OUR PROPOSED BUDGET THAT'S FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN WATER RESILIENCE IS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON PROVIDING FUNDING TO REGIONS TO GET THE SHOVEL READY OUR STORAGE PROJECTS IN PLACE. THANK YOU- AND WE CAN GO OVER TO OTHER ONES TOO AS WE GO THROUGH OF ANOTHER BIG CONCERN ON THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON MY COLLEAGUES SPOKE ON IT I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FUNDING FOR THE HYDROGEN R. AND D. AND TO BE A WELFARE WITH ELECTRIC SIDE SO THERE EVEN SO THE RESIDENTS TO CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE A CHOICE THERE WILL BE JUST SAY YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ELECTRICITY BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHOICE. WITH WHAT THEY DO FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND- I THINK IT WAS ADDRESSED EARLIER THAT WE CAN TRY TO GET SOME MORE FUNDING TOWARDS AT. IT'S ENOUGH ANOTHER- STICKLER FOR ME IS WE'RE RENEWING TAXES WE'RE HAVE A WINDFALL OF MONEY IN THE STATE WE KNOW THAT WERE OVERTAXED ALREADY AND WE SHOULD BE LOWERING THE TAXES OF NOT EXTENDING THESE TAXES TO THE RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN RETAIN THE RESIDENTS TO STAY HERE INSTEAD OF MOVING IN AND OFF ALREADY LIVE MY TIME FOR THE NEXT COMENTS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS BUT WE SHOULD ESTABLISH QUORUM- BEFORE ANY MEMBERS NEED TO LEAVE- SO WHY DON'T WE DO THAT. HELLO HERE SENATE HERE. MULLIN PATTERSON READ IT HERE BUT THERE. THANK YOU SO WE'RE OFFICIAL NOW- ON THE TOPIC OF- JOBS THE CV R. P. B. C. P. SAYS THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE TARGETED TO LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME CUSTOMERS. I HOW IS THAT GOING TO BE STRUCTURED AND- IN A WAY THAT IS AS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE- BECAUSE OF THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THE BCP IT'S VERY FOCUSED ON- THOSE WITH THE MOST MODEST MEANS AND I'M AT A CHURCH SHOULD BE EXPANDED SOMEWHAT BEYOND THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND SO AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE PLANNING ON LIMITING THE PROGRAM TO TARGET THESE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CONSUMERS HAPPY TO TURN IT OVER AGAIN TESTED IF SHE HAS ADDITIONAL DETAIL. I THINK THEY DETAIL THERE'S AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED MOST THAT THE WHAT YOU SEE IN THE MAIN REPRISES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REALLY FOCUSES- QUITE A BIT ON EQUITY- IS SUPPOSED TO CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM AND THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT ARE REPRESENTED HERE- AND BOTH OF THOSE TRAITS SERVE AS YOU MENTIONED. ARE THOSE WITH- LEAST MEANS SO UNDER BUT IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROGRAM QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE WELL I GUESS THAT THE QUESTION IS THERE ARE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE- ABOVE THE- POVERTY LINE BUT- STILL- BUT NOT ABLE TO. AFFORD VEHICLE A CLEANER VEHICLE WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF THE REBATE PROGRAM SO HOW DO WE HELP THOSE FOLKS WHY DO WE WANT TO LIMIT THIS- AT THE PLACE WHERE YOU'RE LIMITING IT. WE ARE PROPOSING. SURE I'M SO I CAN SPEAK TO PERHAPS THE PROGRAM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CLEAN CARS FOR A PROGRAM IN THE C. P. R. P. PROGRAM AND PERHAPS THAT THAT WILL HELP I'M IN TERMS OF THIS THE SPECIFIC DIRECTION ON THE SEAT EUROPEAN AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ALL DEFERRED A DEAL LAST- BUT QUITE SIMPLY- WHEN I LOOK AT THE TWO PROGRAMS THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE AT THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM IS REALLY INTENDED. YOU KNOW TO HELP ACCELERATE BOOKS AREN'T NECESSARILY IN THE NEW VEHICLE MARKET BUT HELP ACCELERATE GET THE MENTIONS GETTING THEM AND IS YOUR MOBILITY OPTIONS THAT PROGRAM DOES REQUIRE THE SCRAP OF CAR IN ORDER TO GET INTO A CLEANER OR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE WERE A SICKLY VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT IS FOR NEW PURCHASES ONLINE. OKAY I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT WE HAVE A TRANSITION- THAT WE INTEND TO COMPLETE BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A LONG WAY OFF BUT IT'S NOT THAT FAR AWAY- AND- I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A- LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLAN. THAT TO A- PROVIDES US WITH THE ROAD MAP OF. HOW WE'RE GONNA GET TO THAT PLACE. OF WHICH IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT. POVERTY LINE. UNTIL JUST LEAVE AT. AT THAT SET UP FOR NOW- I'D LIKE TO MOVE UP BRIEFLY TO THE- FIVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN MANUFACTURING GRANTS THAT ARE PROPOSED AND ASK- WATER THOSE. ARE INTENDED TO BE USED FOR AND HOW WILL THAT BE STRUCTURED.

JUNE NINTH- INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED PROJECTS. WHAT ARE TO BE OPEN TO BOTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE VEHICLES AS WELL- AS WELL AS THE ICAL COMPONENTS AND EVEN THE BATTERY COMPONENT WHICH MAKE UP THE VEHICLES. SO IT BE BROUGHT UP IN THE HOLD BECAUSE OF SOME. WELL I GUESS I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS- I. CERTAINLY DON'T QUESTION THE IMPORTANCE OF- INCENTIVIZING GAGA MANUFACTURING. IN THE- IN IN IN THE VEHICLE MARKET TO ITS 40% OF THOUGHT REPRESENTS 40% OF GREENHOUSE GAS AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG SECTOR BUT- THE OTHER. BIG EMISSIONS ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IF YOU WILL- IS- THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. AND IS THERE A REASON WHY. WE WOULD NOT USE MANUFACTURING GRANTS LIKE THESE IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE- A NEW BEST PRACTICES AND STRATEGIES AND FOR EXAMPLE THE HOUSING MARKET LIKE WHY NOT- I USE THESE FUNDS- TO- ENCOURAGE THE GROWTH OF THE MODULAR HOUSING INDUSTRY. HERE WHICH- WILL HAVE THE CO BENEFITS I THANK OF HELPING TO REDUCE THE COST OF PRODUCTION OF HOUSING WHICH IS ANOTHER CRITICAL. NEED AND IN THE STATE. COOPER ADD FIND ON A QUICK. YEAH THE- MAY REFER FOR RESOURCES AGAIN TO COMMITTEE EXISTING BILL PROGRAM AND A SUITE OF ACTIVITIES TO DEAL WITH EXTREME HEAT THAT- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE- ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TARGETED TOWARDS DEVELOPERS WITHIN THE EXISTING BILL PROGRAM THEY DO ADDRESS THAT. I BELIEVE THE CHAIR IS RIGHT THAT- MORE COULD BE DONE BONTA FOR MAIN GRANTS WITHIN THE HOUSING BUT I NOT PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. HI TO SUGGEST THAT WE ALL GET THOUGHT- EXPANDING GOT WE USE THESE GRANTS AND PERHAPS- X. THE- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S PUT A THE- TO. THOSE OF.

SO I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS- FUNDING IN THERE I PARTICULARLY- I APPRECIATE THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR LOAN FOR INNOVATIVE- IDEAS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS- YOU GRANTS OF FOUR COMPANIES TO COME AND DEVELOP NEW IDEAS AND LOCATE HERE. BUT I BELIEVE WE REALLY DO HAVE A RECYCLING CRISIS THAT IS JUST IT'S NOT SEXY RIGHT NOW- FOR- FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT N TERMS OF EVERYBODY ADDRESSING IT AND I HOPE WE JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND IT IS A- HUGE PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE OUT THERE- THE SECOND THING IS- ALONG THE LINES OF. RECYCLING THERE IS- I BELIEVE ONE POINT THREE OR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR- DRAFT- GILL NET IT'S A PROGRAM STEP BY UP OF SOME OF THE PERMITS FOR THAT. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE- SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE NOW ABLE TO RECYCLE THOSE MILE LONG DRIFT NETS THAT ARE OUT THERE. DOES DOES STAFF KNOW WHAT THIS BOY TIME. WHAT THE AMOUNT IS THAT WE NEED TO BUY UP. OF THESE CREDITS ARE THERE THESE PERMITS THAT ARE OUT THERE. IN OTHER WORDS ONE POINT THREE BILLION IS THAT. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE PERMITS WOULD THAT POTENTIALLY COVER TO DOES ANYBODY KNOW THAT AT THIS POINT TIME. YES IF I MIGHT YEAR. YES OF COURSE.

TWO OTHER PURCHASES. IT'S AN IN HOUSE BUYING THE LAND TURNING IT OVER TO A- OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION DISTRICT AND THEN RELIEVING THE STATE OF THE ON GOING COST THIS IN ANOTHER LEADER YEARS WE ALWAYS HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO MANAGE OF THE LAND IN OUR STATE PARKS.

EFFORTS INCLUDE EXPANDED KIOSK DEPLOYMENT LAUNCHING A REDESIGNED RESPONSIVE WEBSITE ADDING PEOPLE YOU TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS OF FIELD OFFICES AND IMPROVING EMPLOYEE TRAINING TO FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS THERE MAY REVISION. INCLUDES PROPOSALS TO CONTINUE THESE IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS AMID CHANGING CONDITIONS INCLUDE LOOTING THE ONGOING PANDEMIC IN CHANGING FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THE MAYOR IS AN AWESOME WHICH RESOURCES FOR NEW MOBILE IDENTITY PROGRAM- BUT TO START OFF- THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSED TO SHIFT FOUR HUNDRED NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN COST FOR REAL ID PROCESSING FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT AS WAS PROPOSED OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO THE GENERAL FUND. EVEN THOUGH THE FEDERAL REAL ID ENFORCEMENT DATE WAS EXTENDED FROM THIS OCTOBER TO MAY TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE NUMBER OF RELIGIOSITY IF HE'S EXPECTED TO HAVE TO PROCESS HAS NOT CHANGED. AS TRAVEL WAS RESTRICTED DURING THE PANDEMIC APPLICATIONS FOR REAL LADIES DROP BELOW PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. HOWEVER AS THE COUNTY REOPENS THE ENVY INTO SPACE RETURN TO INCREASE RELY THE WORKLOAD EPERIENCED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. DMV HAS PROVIDED TEN POINT THREE MILLION UNIQUE REALLY D. SO FAR AND USED TO PROCESS SOME TWO MILLION MORE. TO PROVIDE THE ENVY WITH. THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST ITS WORK FORCE EXPENDITURES. TO CHANGES IN THE DEMAND OF REALIZE HE'S BEEN A REVISION PROPOSES AN EXTENDED ENCUMBRANCE LIQUIDATION PERIOD FOUR YEARS. BOB WHAT KIND OF GOES ALONG WITH THE REAL ID ACT PASSED BY THE FEDS IS- A STATE THE STATE PROGRAM WHICH REQUIRES CALIFORNIA TO SEND.

ADDITIONALLY- DURING THE PANDEMIC CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE ITS SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES INCLUDING OPERATIONALIZE IN A VIRTUAL FIELD OFFICE AND ENABLING NEW AND EXPANDED ONLINE SERVICES FOR WEB AND MOBILE DEVICES. ALMOST 95% OF ALL DMV TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW DONE THROUGH ONE OF THE NBA'S VIRTUAL CHANNELS RATHER THAN FIELD OFFICE WHICH CREATES ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND REDUCE WAIT TIME. IN THE FIELD OFFICES TO HANDLE TRANSACTIONS THAT REQUIRE AN IN PERSON VISIT LIKE GETTING A REALIZE. TO ACCELERATE THE MODERNIZATION DMV THE MARRIAGE INCLUDES FIFTY FOUR MILLION ONE TIME.

SYSTEM FOR THAT. THERE'S ALSO- A FIVE POINT NINE MILLION FOR AB EIGHTY FIVE WHICH REQUIRE DMV TO BEGIN BECAUSE- ACTING SALES ON HIS CARDIO. AND FINALLY THERE IS NOT A COUPLE OUT PROJECTS INCLUDING TEN MILLION IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WITH THAT I WILL- TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND HANDED OVER TO MY TEAM BE CALLING FROM READY TO. THANK YOU. I'M SORRY TERM LOAN THIS IS STEVE GOING FROM THE PART OF WHAT IT WAS I WAS ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE A QUESTION I FEAR WITH MY STAFF TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE- I DO HAVE QUESTIONS BUT I THOUGHT- WE HAD ONE MORE PRESENTATION. THAT WE HAVE ALL THAT FOR THAT ONE PROGRAM SHOULD BE ON ON- BROADBAND. THAT'S CORRECT AYMAN NOW BEEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HAPPY TO BRING TO YOU DEMONSTRATION PROPOSAL BY TO DEVELOP EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL IS TO EXPAND ACCESS AND IN DOING SO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BOTH AN ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AND IF WE'RE GOING TO OVERCOME THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES. OF A CHEATING BROADBAND FOR ALL WE MUST INVEST IN THE MIDDLE MILE AND MAKE THAT OPEN ACCESS FOR ENTITIES LIKE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES NONPROFITS. WHAT THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE CLEAR IS FAST AND RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE BROADBAND ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL LEARNING HOW IT WORKS TELEHEALTH. IS A CORNERSTONE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. DESPITE THIS LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN INTERNET ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY PROCESS. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU WOULD HELP COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TRACK ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT BY FUNDING STOPS FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOR HIGH SPEED BROADBAND IS ABSENT OR INSUFFICIENT. INCREASING ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND ENABLING DISTANCE LEARNING TELEWORK AND TELEMEDICINE. SPECIFICALLY RELIABLE FAST NON DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS ENABLES CONNECTION TO COMMUNITIES WHERE BEARS TO CONNECTIVE ITTY HAVE SEVERAL LAYERS THE PRIMARY ONE BEING A LACK OF MIDDLE MILE PREVENTING A LAST MILE PROVIDER CONSERVING THE COMMUNITY. OFTEN THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIDDLE MILEAGES OR NONEXISTENT- TO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD O TO LEASE. AT A HIGH LEVEL BROADBAND NETWORKS ARE GROUPED INTO THREE CATEGORIES BACKGROUND OR LONG HAUL WHICH ARE THE TRANSCONTINENTAL CABLES THAT RUN ALONG EACH STATE HIGHWAYS AND ROADWAYS MIDDLE MILE WHICH IS THE HIGH CAPACITY INFRASTRUCTURE IN CONNECTION BETWEEN COMMUNITIES. AT CONNECT. THESE NOTES TO THE WIDER INTERNET. Là MILE WHICH AT THE CABLES AND OR TENNIS HOUSE AND BUILD TO CALL MIDDLE THOUGH. NEARLY ALL MIDDLE MILE NETWORK TO OPERATION TODAY ARE SINGLE PAYER. MEANING THERE AN OP BY. RIDER THE LACK OF AVAILABLE MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN CONNECTING CALIFORNIA'S UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE CAN PROVIDE AFFORDABLE SERVICE FOR ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS AND REDUCE THE PRICE OF BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE BY ENABLING COMPETITIVE LAST MILE NETWORKS. LAST MILE INFRASTRUCTURE RELIES ON MIDDLE MILE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO RESIDENTS LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES SCHOOLS GOVERNMENT OFFICES PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES AND LIBRARIES. AND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT. HAS APPROXIMATELY BROADBAND AT ALL SPEEDS BUT ONLY JUST OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIANS 52% ARE USING BROADBAND AND HIGH A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND BENCHMARK. SERVICE BELOW A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND ISN'T ENOUGH FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE JUGGLING DEMANDS OF DISTANCE LEARNING TELEWORK ONLINE HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS ACCESSING GOVERNMENT SERVICES. RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE HIT THE HARDEST HIT WITH 51% OF RURAL HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO BROADBAND SERVICE THAT A HUNDRED. AND ALMOST HALF OF HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS AND SERVICE OF A HUNDRED DOWN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS ARE LOCATED ALSO IN ARABIC AREAS AND TRIBAL LANDS ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED WITH 28% OF HOMES LACK OF THIS. ESSENTIAL BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS LARGEST P. OFF REDUCED PRO WILL INCOME HOW. THAT SUBSCRIBE SHIP WITH A SLIM WITH ALL FORMED AT THAT SIX. THESE PER ARE NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF ESTIMATED TWO POINT THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS FALLING BELOW CALIFORNIA'S POVERTY LEVEL. CALIFORNIANS ALADDIN SUBSIDIES TO PRIVATE COMPANIES TO BRING BROADBAND SERVICE TO ANSWER COMMUNITIES ABOUT COURAGE IS NO LONGER EFFECTIVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STOLEN CERVANTES CHRISTIAN POPULATION DENSITY. HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR TOO EXPENSIVE FOR SERVICE BRIGHTEST REACH TO BE PROFITABLE. SO INACTIVE NEVER CAN PUBLIC SENT SECTOR EXISTENCE THESE IMPORTANT HIGH COST COMMUNITIES ARE UNABLE TO GET CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. AND AT THE SAME TIME PARTS OF URBAN COMMUNITIES LACK ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY BROADBAND AND WHEN THEY ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE BROADBAND THEY ONLY HAVE ONE CHOICE. THE ME REVISION PROPOSALS AIM TO DO THE FOLLOWING ALLOCATE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS CONTRACT AND STATE OWNED OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK USING A COMBINATION OF STATE LOCAL AND I REALLY AREN'T ANY RIGHTS OF WAY. THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK WILL EXPAND ACCESS AND CAPACITY FOR NEW AND EXISTING LAST MILE NETWORKS AND PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE NO BRINGING NEW PROVIDERS AND OFTEN MORE OFTEN OFFER MORE OPTIONS TO ALL. CUSTOMERS AND LOWER SERVICE COSTS. IT MAY REGIONAL FROM ADDITIONAL LAST MY FUNDING CONNECT THE MIDDLE AND THE NUMBER OF HASSLE THAT ACTS TO BROAD. WILL SERVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO RAISE MONEY TO DEPLOY PUBLICLY ON LAST MILE NETWORKS WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GET THEIR COMMUNITIES CONNECTED. WE'LL MAKE SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME FUNDING AVAILABLE TO EXPEDIT UPGRADES IN AREAS SERVED BY SMALL INDEPENDENT TELEPHONE CORPORATION CERVANTES CARRIES A LAST RESORT. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL AND WE WANT USES INVESTMENTS ONCE FILLED BUILD FOR THE FUTURE. AND OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK WILL PROVIDE THE BACKGROUND LAST MONTH THE BRIGHTEST SECOND. LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES SCHOOLS GOVERNMENT OFFICES PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES AND LIBRARIES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS PROPOSAL AND WITH ME TODAY REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS AND REBATES FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WE'RE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- DOES- LA- HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THIS A- VERY COMPLEX- WELL ABOVE FOR A PROPOSAL SENATOR. A COVERING A GOOD DEAL OF GROUND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BRIAN BROWN WHAT- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I THINK GIVEN HOW ABLY PLANTS WITH ABLE TO COVER THE DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS PROPOSAL I THINK I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS. ARE PRETTY HIGH LEVEL AND- REALLY JUST MAKE TWO POINT ONE ANDOVERALL A POINT ON THE ARCHITECTURE OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IN THE NAY REVISED AND THEN I'LL JUST TOUCH ON A FEW OF THE KEY PROPOSALS AND OUR INITIAL COMMENTS- SO WITH RESPECT TO THE OVERALL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION JUST WANT TO NOTE. FOR CONTEXT THAT THE VISION INCLUDES A TEN BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN TOTAL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES RELATIVE TO THE JANUARY PROPOSAL SO THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE OVER 40% RELATIVE TO JANUARY. OF THAT TOTAL FOUR BILLION IS FROM THE GENERAL FUND- FOR BILLION IN BOND AT THE WORDY AND A BILLION DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL FUNDS SO IT'S JUST A LOT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DO A LOT OF NEW ACTIVITIES- SO WITH RESPECT TO A FEW OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPOSALS AND IT'S BEEN A REVISION A FEW BECAUSE COMMENT. FIRST ON THE TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE DO YOU WANT TO JUST HAS A VERY LARGE PACKAGE THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPONENT. TO THAT IS- DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO DESCRIBE- GENERALLY WE THINK THE KEY QUESTIONS IN REVIEWING THIS PACKAGE- IT JUST FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INCREASE FUNDING SUCH AS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR RAIL PROJECTS. IN LOS ANGELES WHAT IT DOES ALIGN WITH YOUR BROADER BUDGETARY PRIORITIES- WITH RESPECT TO THE CLEAN CALIFORNIA PROGRM ONE POINT FIVE BILLION OVER THREE YEARS IN THE GENERAL FUND- TO DO BEAUTIFICATION AND ART PROJECTS ON- STATE HIGHWAYS AND LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS AGAIN IT'S A VERY SIMILAR ISSUE JUST REALLY QUESTIONED WHETHER. THOSE ARE PRIORITIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE OR WHETHER YOU HAVE OTHER HIGHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES EITHER IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR- FOR OTHER ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MAINTENANCE OR- I AM ADAPTATION PROJECT OR OTHER THINGS. OR YOU IN OTHER PARTS OF. THE BUDGET. TURNING TO THE DEAL PRO. THAT HEARD ABOUT. REALLY TWO POINTS TO MAKE ONE IS THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THE FOR. THAT AS RELY. AND IF YOU LOOK CLOUD THAT THINK ARE REALLY REASONABLE TO ADDRESS. THE- NEED TO SIR IN THE BETTER MEET WORKLOAD DEMAND BUT WE HAVE SOME TECH RECOMMENDATION THAT WILL GO INTO THE MID IN THE MOMENT BUT WE I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES HERE CONTAINS QUESTIONS BUT WE DO THINK THERE COUPLE TACKLE TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS YOU COULD ADOPT. TO INCREASE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY ON THOSE ON THOSE PROGRAMS- AND THEN ALSO WITH RESPECT TO THE- DMV'S DIGITAL ACCELERATION PROPOSAL WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION BUDGET REQUESTED NOT INCLUDE- ENOUGH- SUFFICIENT INFORMATION OR JUSTIFICATION FOR. WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES BE UNDERTAKEN OR JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING REQUESTED TO SUPPORT THOSE ACTIVITIES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ADMINISTRATION TO ASK THEM QUESTIONS AND GET MORE INFORMATION THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THAT AND OBVIOUSLY WE'LL SHARE IT WITH YOUR STAFF- WE DO THINK THOUGH THAT THESE ARE PROBABLY. LESS IMMEDIATE PRIORITY SO IF IN THE COURSE OF THE CANAL IN JUNE FIFTEENTH IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FROM. THE DEPARTMENT WE DO THINK THIS IS ONE THAT PROBABLY COULD BE REJECTED AND IN THIS CASE YOU CAN COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE WITH A NEW PROPOSAL AND MORE INFORMATION- TURNING TO HIGH SPEED RAIL THIS THE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDADOR DE. I'M SORRY AND- PROPOSITION WHEN THEY BONTA FORTY- YOU MAY RECALL THAT OUR OFFICE- RELEASED A REPORT REVIEWING THE- AUTHORITIES BUSINESS PLAN. ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO- OUR COMMENTS REMAIN LARGELY THE SAME WHICH IS AS SOME DECISIONS THAT YOU HAVE NOW- THIS IS SORT OF AN IMPORTANT DECISION POINT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW- WITH RESPECT TO THE- THE PLAN- IN THE APPROACH THAT THE AUTHORITY IS TAKING. AND ULTIMATELY WHETHER TO APPROVE ALL OR SOME OF THIS- BONTA FORTY IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE REALLY- IN LARGE PART DEPEND ON THAT LEGISLATORS COMMITMENT TO COMPLETING ELECTRIFIED. MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT AS PER. IN THE LAST TURNING TO THE PROPOSE THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT- WE'RE JUST BE TO DIG INTO THIS- VERY LARGE PROPOSED THERE'S STILL A OF HIM FOR WE'RE TRYING TO TOGETHER OF AND- QUESTION OR POINTS TO MAKE ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE QUESTION OF- WHY THE MINISTRATION OF PROPOSING TO COMMIT GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE- THIS PUTTING IN PART BECAUSE IF THEY'RE IN THERE COULD POTENTIALLY BE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE- NEXT THE NEXT YEAR- THAT MIGHT NEGATE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND. A SECOND- WE ARE- WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COST ESTIMATES FOR THIS PROPOSAL WE NOTE THAT THERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BROADBAND ACTION PLAN SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT QUESTION IN IN THIRD- JUST KNOW THAT IT- WELL WE THINK THAT THERE IS A REASON TO FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND DOING- WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS NOT ATTENTION PAID IN THE PROPOSAL TO OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS AFFORDABILITY INTO THEIR THEIR- I THINK THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO CONSIDER SO I WILL I WILL STOP THEIR JUST NOT THAT I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE LINE TO YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS IF YOU WANT TO GET. INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE STILL HAVE THE PUBLIC TO HEAR AND- IT'LL TAKE SOME FOR QUESTIONS NOW BUT- OR RUNNING SHORT ON TIME- LET'S SET THAT THIS IS JUST SO MUCH. OF TO- I TRY IT IN A GREAT TO AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT LET'S- LET'S DO OUR BEST AND I'D LIKE TO START WITH THE BROADBAND PROPOSAL- I APPRECIATE- THAT THERE IS A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON HOW- WE'RE GOING TO GET FROM THE MIDDLE MILE TO THE TO THE LAST MILE- BUT- CAN SOMEBODY- IDENTIFY WHERE THAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. I HEARD KIND OF AN OUTLINE OF- OF WHAT'S INTENDED. BUT THAT'S NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT'S IN THE- MAY REVISED DOCUMENT. THAT'S CORRECT THE FIND AT THIS IS A MAN OPENED- THE FINANCE LETTER RELEASED THE BROADBAND PROPOSAL WITH THE ASSOCIATED CONTROL SECTION THAT. HOUSES THE ADMINISTRATION'S- TOTAL BUDGET PROPOSAL BACK V. EIGHT BROADBAND B. C. P. AND G. L. ARE FORTHCOMING- EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED SHORTLY- HOW SHORTLY WE DON'T HAVE A HECK OF A LOT OF TIME EVERYTHING IS SHORTLEAF. THE BUDGET IS OUR FINAL IS SHORTLY SO CAN YOU. BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC. I'M I AM TO BACK TO WITH THIS BUT TIME BY RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW THAT. OKAY- LET'S- MOVE TO- DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES- I WAS- AND I THINK DIRECTOR GARDEN- CAR HOPE DIRECTOR GORDON IS SAID- STILL HERE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS- I WAS TAKEN ABACK. BY THE REFERENCE TO NINETEEN SEVENTIES ERA IT- AND- THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT- WE NEED TO ADDRESS- WITH- WITH- WITH ALL DUE. SPEED IF AT ALL POSSIBLE AND TO US- SO I ASSUME AS PART OF THIS MODERNIZATION- THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED THE UPGRADING OF THAT I. T. WILL TAKE PLACE HOW LONG WILL THAT TO. A WILL THAT TAKE. SENATE TEST GORDON MOTOR VEHICLES THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME WE DO HAVE THAT SYSTEM THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE LATE SIXTIES AND THE EARLY SEVENTIES IN THE ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE CALLING WHICH IS JUST TO. KEEP YOU FOR A SECOND AND IT'S HARD TO FIND CAL TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE SARPI RIGHT NOW WITH THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PLATFORM SO CALLED THE X. P. IS OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS IS TO ROLL OUT IN THREE MAJOR PHASES. IS NOT TO MENTION ARE FINANCE STARTING WITH IRAQ LICENSE. MOVING INTO OUR VIEW REGISTRATION WHICH IS THE SURE THE REVENUE FOR STATE ABOUT TO SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR COLLECTED. AND THEN FIND OUT. INDIAN THAT AT THE DRY LICENSE AND I THINK IN THE END I IF YOU AT IT FROM WE STARTED TO THE- IT'S PROBABLY WOULD BE VERY CLOSE TO FIVE YEARS TRANSFER. ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS- MAY PROGRAM. THAT WERE BUILT USING A AND DOWN IN YOUR YOUR AREA WHERE THEY GREW BUILT OVER DIFFERENT. WHAT TO NOW. STREAMLINED THIS PROCESS RHIANNA THOSE AND GET THEM ON A COMMON SO THE LOW FOR AND WERE TO GET UP A FIVE YEAR JOURNEY IN THE. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LONG TIME THE AGE OF- OF THE AND- I'M GLAD WILL BE A TO WHERE ON IT AND- WE WE'VE SEEN A TO WERE DECAYING AND FOR HAS LED TO PROBLEM IN OUR IN OUR WITH OUR ACOSTA AROUND THE STATE AND SO I WOULD CAN THIS A CRITICAL ACT- GOD. A DIRECTOR YOU AND I HAVE US. ABOUT MODERN- THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT TO THE BUILT STRUCTURES UGH- THAT THE DMV HAS AROUND THE STATE- AND- I'M- FOR PURPOSES OF THE BUDGET- WHAT. HELLO JUST TOOK TO BRIEFLY REVIEW- YOU HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE FACT THAT- OF SOME OF YOUR FACILITIES- WERE ALSO I THINK BUILT IN THE SEVENTIES AND DRUG- THE NEEDS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY TALKING UGH- IN THESE BCPS ABOUT- UPGRADING AND CHANGING THE WAY WHICH YOU INTERACT WITH- YOUR CUSTOMER BASE AND THAT UNDOUBTEDLY WILL CHANGE THE- OF THE NEEDS- AND HOPEFULLY THE SIZE OF THE FACILITIES- THAT YOU HAVE. AND I PROPOSED TO YOU THAT- WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE OF FACILITIES WHICH ARE LOCATED TYPICALLY ARE NOT LARGE BLACKTOP BUT- OF A PARKING AREAS WITH RELATIVELY SMALL BUILDINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THAT PROPERTY OPFER HOUSING AS THE GOVERNOR HAS- OF LONG DISCUSSED SO- OTHER THAN SORT OF DAYLIGHTING THAT ISSUE- IT IS THERE ARE A BUDGET ALLOCATION THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN PURSUING- SOME FIRST STEPS IN AND- LOOKING. AT THAT ISSUE. NOT A GOOD QUESTION CHEN I'LL AT IN THE FINAL AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A SPECIFIC OUT FOR SOME OF SITE CONSOLE. AND REAP A WE JUST THAT COUPLE WEEK BACK WITH OFFICE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT WE DO MORE BROADLY IN THE- IN THESE. AFTER CONSOLIDATION PROBABLY FOR HEAD LOCATION AS WE ARE SPREAD ACROSS SACRAMENTO AND WE CAN CONSOLIDATE WE CAN SAVE MONEY AND WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK BETTER AS A TEAM AS WE CONSOLIDATE OUR SITES. WE DO SEE A CHANGE IN OUR FOOTPRINT AS AS WE DISCUSSED WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF IN THE FIELD OFFICE AS WE MOVE MORE THINGS ONLINE MORTGAGE YOUR DIGITIZED MORE THINGS ARE MOVED TO THE MOBILE PHONE. YEAH THAT'S GOING TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK OUR FOOTPRINT A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE AN INITIATIVE WITH OUT PLANNING DESIGNER EACH OKAY TO HELP US RETHINK HOW WE DEAL DELIVER SERVICES AND AS WE DO THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH OTHER BUSINESSES. AMAZON TO PICK PROBABLY A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC BUT IT ALLOWS US TO YOU FREE UP ASSETS THAT ARE OUT. IN THE FIELD OR READ YOUR REVIEWS THURMOND AND AWAY THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THINGS THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED ABOUT YOUR ATTY NOT AS IN RESIDENTS HERE. MIXED USE PROPERTIES FOR BOTH YOUR RESIDENTS RESIDENTS OVER OVER BUSINESS AND SO ON BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A SPECIFIC BUDGET REQUIREMENT I'LL I'M AND I AM LOOKING AT DO YOU F. MATT. I DON'T BELIEVE THE TWENTY THE PROPOSAL TODAY FOR THAT SPECIFIC. THERE IS HOWEVER ALSO AS YOU MAY THERE ARE STEPS. BASICALLY STEPS WE WOULD NEED TAKE- TO LEAD. CONSOLIDATION FUTURE AND IN IN THE MANNER OF HIS- IN ONE HOW AND THREE- GENERAL FUND PROPOS IS A- TWENTY MILLION TO DO UPGRADES TO IN THESE HEADQUARTERS IN SACRAMENTO- AND THOSE ARE KIND OF REQUIRED- BEFORE WE START BRINGING PEOPLE BACK- FROM ELSEWHERE- INTO HEADQUARTERS- WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO- TO- CLOSE SOME OFFICES- IN THE FUTURE. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO PUT THIS OUT THERE THAT WE'VE LONG DISCUSS TO. PRIORITIZING USING UNDER UTILIZED OR UNDERUTILIZED A SURPLUS- A STATE LAND FOR HOUSING PURPOSES- THIS IS NOT A NEW DISCUSSION- AND YET WE'VE SEEN PRECIOUS LITTLE OF FOLK- THAT TRANSITION ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE AND TOOK SO THIS IS BUDGET SUB THREE IT'S NOT- ARE OVERSIGHT IS AN OVER HOUSING BUT- THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY- THIS KIND OF UNDER UTILIZED RESOURCE. SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS MOST PRESSING ISSUE- THAT IS AT A CRISIS LEVEL TODAY- AND ACCELERATE OUR OUR- OUR OUR REVIEW AND TO HOPEFULLY MOVEMENT TOWARD UTILIZING THOSE THOSE THOSE PROPERTIES AND I DON'T MEAN TO PICK ON A DMV HERE- I THINK- TO THE DIRECTOR GARDENS CREDIT HE'S BEEN WILLING TO- ENGAGE IN THE DISCUSSION AROUND TO AROUND THIS BUT I THINK EVERY DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE. DOING EXACTLY. THAT- OUR THERE OTHER SEN HELLO JUST MOVED ON THE ROAD HERE WILL US- THANK MISTER BENNETT THANK YOU FOR MUCH TERRIBLE- NUMBER ONE- LOVE REALLY PLEASED SEE. DENTIST INVEST AND ACTIVE. J. BUSES AND TRY- IN AS I SAY SHE BEFORE AT LIKE TO AND- JUST ONE OF THE CITY. WHERE WE I BELIEVE NEED TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE- TO BE THERE TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ADOPT THESE VEHICLES LIKE CENTER AND- WILL HAVE WEEK THIS IS ONE TIME WE NEED TO PUT THAT FIRST. IN OTHER WORDS COMMAND ECONOMIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE QUICK TRANSITIONS BECAUSE THEY- MAKE THOSE KIND OF INVESTMENTS AND I THINK THAT HOPEFULLY WE WILL. BE AHEAD OF THE CURVE RATHER THAN BEHIND THE CURVE IN TERMS OF RECHARGING STATIONS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD- BUT I APPRECIATE THAT- HERE- FOR THIS HAVE BUSES AND TRUCKS AND LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THAT. AND FOR VEHICLES THE SECOND THING IS- IN TERMS OF THE DMV- TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTMENTS- THAT YOU HAVE COMING UP- WE HAVE SUCH A LONG HISTORY OF COST OVERRUNS AND DELAYS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE TRY TO IMPLEMENT- THE PSYCHES PROJECTS. I'D LIKE TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE- THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH THE I. T. PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOT EXCLUSIVELY RELY ON OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS WHO DON'T HAVE. THE SAME KIND OF COMMITMENT TO LONG TERM SUCCESS OF THE STATE AS A HAS PEOPLE INSIDE DO THERE'S TRADITIONALLY AND BUREAUCRACIES TENSION BETWEEN THE I. T. DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT TRYING TO DO THE IMPLEMENTATION I THINK WE HAVE TO BRING THAT TO AN END AND I HOPE THAT- THE DMV WILL. WELL TAKE A- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE OF BEEN BROUGHT IN TO I. T. HAD TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A SMOOTH TRANSITION BUT I WILL BE WATCHING THAT WOULD CLOSELY- TO MAKE SURE PROFESSIONALLY HANDLED NUMBER THREE- I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE DETAILS BUT I WOULD LIKE ALEJO TO KEEP CONTINUE TO LOOK AT- THE BROADBAND INVESTMENT THE MIDDLE MILE INVESTMENT IN PARTICULAR- I THINK OVERALL THAT IF YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT IF PEOPLE WORK- CONNECTED TO ELECTRICITY NOW- THEY WOULD REALLY BE AT RISK FOR SURVIVAL IN MODERN AMERICA. AND CERTAINLY NOW WE ARE MAKING THE TRANSITION TO IF YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO- HIGH SPEED ACCESS YOU ALSO ARE AT RISK IN MODERN AMERICA AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE EFFORTS THAT WE MAKE WITH THE MIDDLE MILE INVESTMENT IN THE- THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS THERE THAT WE HAVE. THAT ALEJO. ACCESS- HELPFUL- FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE BEST INVESTING. AND THEN- THE FINAL SAY IS JUST THING- IN THE BEAUTIFICATION PROGRAM- I AM JUST CURIOUS BUT IT'S BEEN RAISED- MANY TIMES BY THE NUMBER OF- CONSTITUENTS. THAT WE HAVE A CRISIS WITH THE WESTERN MONARCH BUTTERFLIES- IN THAT WE'VE- COMPLETELY. THE COMPLETELY LOST THEIR THEIR MILK WEED AND- IS IT POSSIBLE FOR CALTRANS- AND SOME OF THIS BEAUTIFICATION FUNDING TO GO FOR THE PLANNING OF THE MILK WE TO TRY TO HELP US PRESERVE- THE MONARCH BUTTERFLIES- AS A ONE OF THE-ANCILLARY BENEFITS OF THE INVESTMENTS OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU MISTER SMITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. EIGHT OF THE ELEVEN DOLLAR FOR TRANS. HE SAYS ONE BILLION IN. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPICS. IS THAT ALL GOING TO LA CITY- L. A. COUNTY AND YOU HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT THIS ONE BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE USED FOR. AND I GUESS EVERYBODY CAN ANSWER. THERE SHUFFLING THE DECK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON THIS IS CHAD ADDISON FROM CAL STA I CAN I CAN ADDRESS THAT THE BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS PROPOSED ON IN SUPPORT OF THE- OUR DELIVER BEFORE THE L. A. OLYMPICS. IS SUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH THE TRANSIT NURSING RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM WE WOULD DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR THAT PROGRAM INTO A CALL FOR PROJECTS LATER THIS YEAR AND I WORK FUNDING FOR PROJECTS BY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ON THE L. A. METRO TO EIGHT BY TWO WEST THERE TO WORK. WHERE ARE AMONG THOSE THAT WOULD BE. THAT OTHER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE REGION WOULD BE THAT THERE ARE TWO MAIN PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT THE L. A. X. ALSO. YEAH BECAUSE A LIVE PICTURE SIX AND A HALF YEAR AWAY DO PROPOSE A- MAYBE. TO TWENTY FOR YOU'RE GONNA ANOTHER. OR TWO BILLION TO FINISH THESE PROJECTS WANT TO GET STARTED. YEAH THE FUNDING HERE IS MEANT TO BE HELPFUL AND- FINISHING A NUMBER OF PROJECTS AROUND THE REGION THAT ARE. VERY USEFUL BOTH FOR THE OLYMPICS AND ALSO BEYOND THESE ARE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT ARE. THAT ARE ALREADY ON ON THE BOOKS AS NEEDING NEEDING ENOUGH. FUNDING TO GET COMPLETED A PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND WILL STRICTLY BE FOR TRANSPORTATION. FOR THE OLYMPICS AND NOT STRUCTURES FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES. NOT STRUCTURES ARE TRêN AND RAIL. SUPPORTING THE OLYMPICS AND IN REGARDS TO THE SOME OF THE- NO CLEAN. EMISSIONS I KNOW ON MY DISTRICT A TRASH TRUCK IS ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PROPOSAL EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRUCK WE'RE GOING TO GET EIGHTY SEVEN TRASH TRUCKS IN THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP THESE OF VEHICLES CHARGED UP. IN MY SAME COMMENTS WOULD BE FOR THE BUSES THE TRANSIT BUSES THERE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS WE'LL GET A HUNDRED OF THEM IN THE STATE BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED TWICE AS MANY BOSSES IN TRASH TRUCKS TO RUN THE SPROUT THAT THEY CURRENTLY DO RIGHT NOW. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE HIM HALFWAY BETWEEN THEIR ROUTE OF THE SCHOOL BUS OF THE TRANSIT BUS OR THE TRASH PICK UP IN THE COMMUNITY SO I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY MAKE THE INVESTMENT FOR THESE CHARGING STATIONS AND COME UP WITH THE TECHNOLOGY TWO QUICK CHARGING TO CHARGE HIM QUICKLY. BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY HAVE TO STOP HALFWAY IN CHARGE FOR SIX OR EIGHT OR TWELVE HOURS TO FINISH THE ROUTE IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. AND THEN I HAVE. WITH THE- FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA LETTER YES WE GOT TO CLEAN UP THE LITTER CALIFORNIA. BUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ARTWORK I THINK WE COULD USE A LOT MORE. OF THERE'S A LOT MORE NEEDED CALIFORNIA. IN MORE PARK WORK SO. SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS DID YOU HAVE QUESTIONS COMMENTS OKAY- MS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU I DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS- FIRST IS- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL SO IF YOU CAN MAYBE QUEUE UP WHOEVER WOULD BE PASSED HAVE CANCER- SO THE REQUEST IS FOR FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION ONE A FUNDING. FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT LOOKING AT THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SPENDING CURRENTLY A YEAR TO YEAR. IT APPEARS THAT THEY WOULD ONLY NEED THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY IF THEY WERE GOING TO DRASTICALLY INCREASE THEIR BUDGET FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO. SO I'M WONDERING WHAT CHANGES YOU'RE ANTICIPATING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. TO JUSTIFY THIS KIND OF AN INCREASE OVER WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING ON CONSTRUCTION. WHAT THIS IS RANDY KATZ WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES SO IN- SILICON EXPENDITURES WE TYPICALLY LOOK AT ENCUMBRANCE EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT OUT EXPENDITURES MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS SO THE FOUR POINT TWO BILLION REQUEST FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL TIES TO THE BUSINESS PLAN AND TO THE FUNDING PLAN PUBLISHED BACK IN FEBRUARY WHEN THEY INDICATED DE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD UNDERTAKERS SEGMENT WOULD COST THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION SO JUST CONSISTENT WITH CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING AND ALSO NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENSURE YOU CAN AWARD MULTI YEAR CONTRACTS. THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE AUTHORITY IN IN PLACE EVEN IF EXPENDITURES TAKE A COUPLE YEARS THANK YOU SO THIS IS NOT TO CONTINUE THE CONSTRUCTION AS THERE ARE PROCEEDING THEY THEY DON'T NEED FOUR POINT- TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT ONE OR EVEN TWO YEARS- GIVEN WHAT THEY ALSO RECEIVE FROM GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDING THIS IS ANTICIPATING FURTHER CONSTRUCTION- OVER. SEVERAL YEARS. YES YES IT WOULD BE THE SEVENTY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COMPLETE- THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT MADERA TO BAKERSFIELD RIGHT SO WITH A LESSER APPROPRIATION THEY COULD STILL CONTINUE CONSTRUCTION EXACTLY AS THEY'RE PROCEEDING RIGHT NOW. THERE YES BUT THERE WOULD BE SOME RISK AND THERE COULD BE SOME CHALLENGES IN THEIR ABILITY TO ON BOARD- DINNER CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE FOR THE REAL WORK AND ELECTRIFICATION. OKAY AND WHAT MONTH DO YOU FORECAST THAT CASH ON HIM FROM PROP ONE A. M. CAP IN TRADE IN FEDERAL FUNDS WILL RUN OUT FOR THE PROJECT. SO I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL. OKAY DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATED CASH FLOW FOR THEM FOR THE NEXT BUDGET FOR THIS BUDGET YEAR. AGAIN I DON'T HAVE TO DEFER TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. OKAY I WANT TO SWITCH OVER I DON'T KNOW WHO'S THE RIGHT PERSON TO THIS ASKING ABOUT THE TRANSIT AND RAIL PROJECT CONNECTIVE ITTY OF BUDGET ITEM- WHICH I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE A BY THE WAY I'M WONDERING AGAIN HOW THE PROJECT FOR THIS WILL BE SELECTED. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THIS IS CHAD ADDISON CALLIS TA- THE PROJECTS THE PROJECTS ELECTION IS PROPOSED TO GO THROUGH A TRANSIT INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM. A PROCESS THAT HAS A SET OF GUIDELINES RELEASED THIS SUMMER ALL FOR PROJECTS. I LATER THIS YEAR AND AWARDS IN. APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THAT THERE IS THAT THERE IS A REGULAR CAP AND TRADE IN SB ONE FUNDING THAT GOES INTO THE R. C. P. WE ARE PROPOSING GENERAL FUND MONEY BE ADDED TO THAT. SO THAT WE CAN DO THE YEAH I. THE CONTROVERSY PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I'M AN AWARD TOO MANY PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO GET GOING AND DELIVER DELIVER CONSTRUCTION AND THE CARE. SO IT'S THE SAME PROJECTS ALREADY IN CUBA YOU KNOW YOU'RE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THEM. YES IT'S WELL EXCEL. AND THERE'S A MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE- ON THE NATURAL WE WOULD HAVE HAD ABOUT FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT ROUND. HE I'M IN THIS MONEY ADDS TO THAT IS AVAILABLE VERY QUICKLY AS OPPOSED TO NEEDING THE WEIGHT OF THE OUTER YEAR OF OUR- OF OUR FUNDING. SO WE NORMALLY DO NOT CHANGING THE PRIORITIZATION IT'S ACCELERATING. ITS ACCELERATING US THAT'S THAT'S GREAT. I'M AND I'M SORRY THAT I AM JUMPING AROUND A LITTLE I KNOW THAT'S HARD ON YOUR END. BUT I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE ZERO EMISSION CLEAN TRUCKS. PROGRAM AT W. AS WELL. THAT I CAN HANDLE OKAY ME SEE IF I HAVE AN- TRAIN. WEST RIGHT NOW I DO NOT SO- WHO ARE THE CLEAN TRUCK. AND CLEAN BECAUSE PERSON IS. AND I GUESS ALL IT WHILE THEY'RE QUEUING UP WHICH WAS A YOU KNOW GIVEN- WHEN IT COMES TO THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR A PARTICULARLY- D. A LECTOR VEHICLES ARE ARE ACTUALLY KIND OF HARD TO FIND AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AS MY COLLEAGUE BROUGHT UP BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S MONEY. SET ASIDE IN THE BUDGET FOR NEAR ZERO OR NATURAL GAS VEHICLES IN THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR SECTOR IN MY HEAVY DUTY. AND MEDIUM DUTY SECTOR. GOOD MORNING DAILY MENON PART OF FINANCE- THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HAS NOT. YET BEEN RELEASED BUT- WE WILL GET BACK TO WHEN WE- TO RELEASE THAT AND THEN- CONFIRM- WHETHER THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO APPROACH WOULD BE MAINTAINED. OKAY SO MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK PARTICULARLY THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR- ARE A NON ATTAINMENT AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS- NEED SOME VERY SHORT TERM RELIEF- FROM THE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS OF. A DRAYAGE TRUCKS AND OTHER HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND THEY FEEL THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THE ZERO EMISSION% VEHICLES ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE GOAL- BUT THAT GETTING SOME OF THOSE DIESEL TRUCKS WALKED OUT WITH NATURAL GAS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD DO PRETTY QUICKLY FOR. NOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD PROVIDE A LOT OF AIR QUALITY RELIEF- IN A SECTOR WHERE. WHEN THOSE TRUCKS GOING TO GET WORSE WALKED OUT THEY'RE BASICALLY GOING TO DIESEL- MOST OF THEM BECAUSE IT'S STILL SO THERE SO STILL SUCH A- A DELTA BETWEEN THE COST OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE THE AVAILABILITY AND THEN THE INCENTIVES. SO JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT- AND- I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE GARBAGE PROGRAM SO I'M SORRY I MAKING YOU GUYS. I THINK SWITCH AROUND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE. MEANWHILE THE WALLS OKAY. AND HI I'M I'M ON THE HUNT FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BOND THANK YOU CALIFORNIA ALSO HAPPY TO SEE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION GENERAL FUND- FOR THE LITTER PROGRAM UNIFICATION PROGRAM FOR THE STATE- I'M WONDERING HOW THE FUNDING IS GONNA BE AWARDED AND WHETHER THERE ARE ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES TO DETERMINE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT KIND OF. THAT THAT HELP THE MOST. WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO OUR EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS AND PROCESSES- COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WILL BE A HUGE ASPECT.OF THIS ENTIRE PROPOSAL. I'M WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RELYING ON OUR THAT PRACTICES IN OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH EXTERNAL AGENCIES LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE THAT THE COLLECTION OF PROJECT IS SOMETHING THAT IS EQUITABLE AND THEY'RE ALSO FOCUSED ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE BEAUTIFICATION PROJECTS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED ARE IN AREAS OF THE STATE- BETTER DIVERSE AND FAR REACHING AND ALSO- YOU KNOW REALLY ARE ARE DEALT WITH THE COMMUNITY THAN MINE. SO CONTACT AND YOU KNOW OUR IS ONE ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSAL BUT REALY THE FOCUS IS ON TAKING AN EXISTING THING. AND TRANSFORMING IT INTO SOMETHING THAT REALLY THE COMMUNITY CAN TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT WE FIND AT CALTRANS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A ROADSIDE. I THANK YOU THAT. PEOPLE QUITE FRANKLY DON'T SEE AS A PART OF THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. THEY TREAT IT AS SCH AND SO THE CONCEPT HERE IS TO REALLY TRANSFORM THIS ISSUE. TAKE EXISTING PARTS OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSFORM THEM INTO- PLACES THAT QUITE FRANKLY BECOME PART OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. SO IT IS A THEY'RE GOING TO BE NEW STATE OR LOCAL PROGRAMS CREATED OR IS THIS IS IT ANTICIPATED. THAT THIS WILL GO THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS. WILL BE. A- WE ALL PREPARED TO DEVELOP AND YOU WILL GREAT PROGRAM YOU HARD THIS PRODUCT. AND THAT WE HAVE LEARNED ON OTHER FOR. WHICH WOULD BE. A FIRST A LOCAL PROGRAM OF ITS KIND BUT AGAIN WE WOULD NOT BE STARTING FROM SCRATCH WOULD BE USING SOME OF THE EXISTING. PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES THAT WE HAVE. TO IDENTIFY AND DISTRIBUTE DOLLARS TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS- FOR BEAUTIFICATION PROJECT OR LITTER ABATEMENT PROJECT. I'M ON THE STATE SYSTEM WE WOULD BE USING OUR EXISTING PROCESSES BUT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE. OUR THE PROJECT DELIVERY SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR STANDARD STANDARD TRANSPORTATION PROJECT THAT COULD TAKE YEARS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT- WE'RE LOOKING AT. ALL OF THE PROJECT BEING ALIVE AND IN PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. SO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROGRAM THAT REMINDS ME A LITTLE OF THE WPA FOR ONE OF OUR LAST BIG ECONOMIC RECOVERIES IN THIS COUNTRY AND- I THINK WE COULD ALL USE A LITTLE BIT OF ART RIGHT NOW IN OUR LIVES- SO I. VERY MUCH COMMAND OF THE VISION OF THIS PROGRAM I YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S GOTTEN THE MOST INTEREST IN THIS PARTICULAR. OUT ITEM HAS TO DO WITH THE INTERACTION WITH THE GROWING PROBLEM OF HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. AND THE DIFFICULTY. THAT MY LOCAL ARM CITIES HAVE. A LOT OF TIMES IN MAINTAINING. AND JUST FRANKLY DEALING WITH HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ARE ON CALTRANS PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE MIX OF AGENCIES. AND THE INABILITY FOR LOCAL CITIES OUT LA SANITATION DISTRICT FOR INSTANCE TO ACCESS CALTRANS PROPERTY TO DO CLEAN UPS- IMPACTS ON NEIGHBORHOODS A LOT OF THESE ARE IN URBAN CONTEXTS IN MY DISTRICT. WITH THE RIGHT AND NEIGHBORHOODS. AND SO THAT CITIES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY THE SAME WAY THAT THEY WOULD IF IT WAS JUST ON A REGULAR CITY STREET. SO I'M WONDERING HOW YOU SEE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT ISSUE WITH THIS PROGRAM. AND. WHETHER I'M- SORRY WHAT THERE'S ANY. BETWEEN THE OR IF THIS IS COMPLETELY SILO TO WEIGH IN. SORT OF GUY HOW HOW. IF YOU HAVE AN AREA THAT'S BEEN AN ENCAMPMENT IN. THE CITY'S SORT OF CLEAN IT UP AND TRY TO HOPEFULLY MOVE PEOPLE INTO SERVICES. HOW WOULD THIS INTERACTION WITH ANY EFFORTS TO SORT OF RESTORE RECLAIM THAT AREA. OVER THE PAST YEAR TRANSPARENCY TAKEN A READ A RADICAL SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS ON THE STATE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT THAT'S PRIMARILY BEEN DRIVEN BY THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND CAN'T CALTRAIN FOLLOWING CDC GUIDELINES. AND REALLY STOPPING THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE I'M WHERE THERE'S NOT A PARTICULAR NEED ONE EVERY DAY I THINK YOU CONCERNS THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED NOT IS WHEN WE WORK WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS TO TRY TO IDENTIFY FAVORITE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO RELOCATE YOU. BUT REALLY WHAT THEY- WHAT THIS YEAR HAS TAUGHT US IS THAT YOU KNOW MOVING PEOPLE AROUND AS A SINGLE ENTITY AT CALTRANS OR AT ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL TELL YOU I'M IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS WORK IN A COORDINATED MANNER WITH THE EXPERTS ON HOMELESSNESS YOU'RE REALLY NOT FAULTING THE COURT OKAY BECAUSE I. JUST JUST MAYBE FOCUS IS A LITTLE MORE SO HOW DOES THIS PROGRAM IS ANY OF THIS FUNDING HOW DOES THAT INTERACT WITH CITIES EFFORTS. TO MOVE PEOPLE OFF- CALTRANS PROPERTY CLEAN UP THOSE AREAS MAYBE SECURITY AREAS WHAT IS THE INTERNETIS THERE ANY INTERACTION BETWEEN THIS PROGRAM AND THIS FUNDING WILL THIS HELP BY CITIES. MAINTAIN OR DEAL WITH OR DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM CAMP MAKING IN. A CALTRANS RIGHT AWAY. THIS IS NOT YOU NOT. DRIVE THE REMOVE PEOPLE CRANKING UP NORTH IN THE AIR OF THE WHERE WE ARE PART. WITH LOCAL. AND TO CONDUCT ME LOW PEOPLE WE CERTAINLY CAN BE AND I'LL- WHERE WE HAVE AN EXISTING AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE TAKING SHELTER ON CALTRAIN PROPERTY. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ABLE TO YOU THE OTHER INITIATIVES WITHIN THE ME REVISED OR THROUGH A PROJECT HOME HE- TO SUCCESSFULLY RELOCATE PEOPLE INTO SHELTER HOUSING. THEN WE CAN IT TAKE NOT LANDS WHERE PEOPLE WERE SHELTERING BEFORE AND TRANSFORM IT INTO INTO. A PLACE THAT REALLY BECOMES A PART OF THE COMMUNITY SO THERE CERTAINLY COULD BE. AND THAT TIME CONGRUENT THERE IF PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW ARE ARE WE LOCATED IN TO SHELTER HOUSING I JUST DON'T WANT THERE TO BE ANY THOUGHT OR BELIEVED FACT. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ANYWAY BE YOU KNOW FORCING PEOPLE WORK FOR ANYTHING HOMELESSNESS OUT OF TOWN TRANSPLANT WITHOUT ALTERNATIVE PLACE RIGHT NOW I'LL I UNDERSTAND I THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT CONCERN AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. CITY LOS ANGELES AND OTHERS DON'T WANT TO BE DOING THAT EITHER AND THEY REALLY DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PEOPLE SERVICES. I GUESS YOU KNOW JUST FUNDAMENTALLY I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY. ABILITY FOR THIS FUNDING TO HELP THE CITY'S- WITH WITH MAINTENANCE FOR THESE THESE PARCELS OR ANY JUST TO GIVE THEM ANY RELIEF. AND SOUNDS LIKE NOT REALLY EXCEPT AFTER THE FACT AFTER THEY DO OFFER SERVICES AND THEY DO CLEAN UP SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT THERE'S- MAYBE SOME SORT OF RESTORATION MONEY TO HELP. YOU MAKE THOSE AREAS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND SOMETHING B. C. FOR AN AND MORE- INGRAINED INTO THE COMMUNITY SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU. BUT I AGREE I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO TAKE ARE YOU OF THESE EFFORTS AS SORT OF. YOU KNOW M. AND BY THE WAY FROM THE CITY SIDE MOVING PEOPLE OFF OF CALTRANS PROPERTY JUST SO THAT THEY CAN MOVED ON THE BLOCK IS NOT pOPTIMAL EITHER I MEAN. YOU KNOW THE- AND EVERYBODY HAS THE GOAL OF ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE HOUSED. SO THE CITIES ARE TRYING TO DO THAT I KNOW CALTRANS IS NOT TRYING TO DO THAT- ABOUT WHEN MY CITY SAW THIS PARTICULAR ALLOCATION. THEY. ALSO SAID- IS THIS SOMETHING WE CAN USE TO HELP US WITH THIS. YOU WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IS FINDING AN THE BUDGET THE PROPOSED THAT WE HELP WITH- HAD A BIG ADDING FIFTEEN CABINET WHILE WE'RE ON BE LOCATION SOLUTION. AND THE IRON INCREASING THE FUNDING FOR TRASH SHOULD BE AND UP IN AREAS YOU KNOW NEAR AN ACTIVE CAN'T SAY THERE IS FINDING AMERICORPS THAT IN PARTICULAR OKAY THAT IS GOOD TO KNOW AND SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE CITIES WILL BE HAPPY TO HEAR AS WELL. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT THE CLIMATE- THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND MY QUESTION IS I DON'T. KNOW IF IT'S FOR YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE BUT I WILL ASK IT. YOU WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASINGLY IT IS IMPACTING AND THREATENING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE HAVE SOME CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT IS VERY MUCH UNDER THREAT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE PARTICULARLY SOME RAIL LINES THAT ARE ALONG. YOU KNOW CLIFFS DOWN IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA. AND I'M WONDERING HOW. THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO PRIORITIZE SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS. THAT ARE. MAYBE TODAY NOT UNDER IMMINENT THREAT BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW. THAT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THEY ARE EXTREMELY HIGH RISK AND- THAT IT'S BETTER TO START THE PROCESS OF MOVING THEM SOMEWHERE SAFE FOR. NOW RATHER THAN WAIT FOR. YOU KNOW. A HUGE EVENTS TO REALLY- I PUT THEM IN IMMINENT PERIL SO I'M WONDERING HOW YOU PRIORITIZE THAT WITHIN THIS IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT PRIORITIZING THAT WITHIN THIS BUDGET. AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE I'M NOT THE RIGHT PERSON. QUESTION SO I WILL DEFER TO IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THIS IS I CHAD ANDERSON AGAIN FROM CAL STA- SOME OF THE PROJECTS HAT YOU REFERRED TO ARE ARE IN THE TRANSIT AND RAIL CATEGORY AND- AND WE CERTAINLY ARE PRIORITIZING. PROJECTS THAT THAT THAT THAT MAKE INVESTMENTS TO SPRINT AND RAIL CORRIDORS- WHERE WHERE THEY ARE. BOTH WHERE THEY ARE NOW BUT ALSO CONSIDERING THOSE RELOCATIONS WE HAD A SUCCESSFUL- SET OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE PUT TOGETHER WITH ON THE DEL MAR BLESSED PROJECT IN PARTICULAR- OVER THIS LAST OVER THIS LAST GUY YEAR. AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BOTH IN GETTING AND I TRADE QUARTER FUNDING AS WELL AS A FEDERAL AND STATE YOU KNOW OTHER STATE FUNDING INTO THAT PROJECT. WHILE ALSO HELPING TO FUND THE STUDY TO RELOCATE THE RAILROAD. I REQUEST UNESCO'S YOU KIND OF GO DOWN THE LIST IS THERE SOME METRIC WE'RE LOOKING AT IT SOME WAY OF EVALUATING RISK. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PARTICULAR TRANSPORTATION YOU KNOW INFRASTRUCTURE- YOU KNOW KIND OF HOW HOW IS THAT DOES. YES THE MOTHERS THERE'S TWO WAYS THAT IT'S DONE. ONE IS THE GUIDELINES OF OUR TRANSACTIONS REAL CAPITAL PROGRAM WHICH LOOK AT YOU KNOW PROJECTS LIKE THESE AND SAY HEY LOOK AT RESILIENCE IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA. ON THAT SECONDARY CRITERIA. I'M WE ALSO HAVE THE- IN THE STATE RAIL PLAN WEEK INCLUDE PROJECTS THAT ARE TIED TO THAT RESILIENCE SO IN THE STATE RAIL PLAN WE HAVE THAT. IN BEING IN THAT PLAN AS PART OF UP IN PRIORITIZE FOR INVESTMENT IN. TRANSIT RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM. AND SO- WE DO HAVE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH TO RECOGNIZE THE YEAH. B. R. OPPORTUNITIES TO IT TOO TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE YOU KNOW. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FUTURE AND PUTTING THEM WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. MADE RESILIENCY ALL. THANKS AND HAVE A COMMENT LASTLY HAVE BEEN SHOULD QUESTIONS WHICH IS THAT I. AM REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THE INVESTMENTS IN THIS BUDGET AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE- IN BEAUTIFICATION THERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO LIKE IN THIS BUDGET AND I THINK IT YOU KNOW WHAT THE BOTTOM. LINE FOR ME IS THAT IT'S A VERY VISIONARY BUDGET THAT ALSO DOESN'T MAKES A REAL DOWN PAYMENT. ON THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA I MEAN NOT ONLY IS IT A RECOVERY BUDGET THAT'S CREATING JOBS. AND MOVING SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE WANTED FOR DECADES IN SOME CASES THAT THEY PRIORITIZE THAT THEY PUT ON A LIST THAT THEY'VE DONE THE INITIAL WORK THEY'VE DONE THE ER'S THE READY TO GO. EXHILARATING THOSE AND GETTING PEOPLE TO WORK BUT GIVING PEOPLE REAL MOBILITY OPTIONS REDUCING CONGESTION REDUCING OUR IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE MAKING US MORE RESILIENT MAKING. US SAFER. IN THIS BUDGET. PRIORITIZES THE THAT HAVE MANY CALL BENEFITS. BUT I THINK THAT IT'S- MOVING THE DAY FOR- IN A POSITIVE WAY IN REDUCING FUTURE COSTS. OF DEFERRING ALL OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WORK. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY EXCITING AND- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON THERE ARE QUESTIONS BUT- BUT I DO THINK IT'S AN EXCITING TIME FOR CALIFORNIA. AND I'M YOU KNOW JUST HAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FRIEDMAN AND CHERRY BLOOM IF I COULD JUMP IN THIS IS A BRIAN ANNIS I'M THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL I. APOLOGIZE I WAS ANSWERING THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S QUESTIONS BUT SET MY AUDIO WAS WAS OFF AND IT WAS. MORE THAN JUST AN AND YET SO I HAD TO RE LOCK AGAIN. BUT IF I IF I COULD RESPOND TO HER QUESTIONS- FOLLOWING UP ON MY- COLLEAGUES FROM FINANCE IN THAT CALIFORNIA'S. TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. ALAMEDA OUR DEALERSHIP YOU IF- IF YOU COULD BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE WOULD APPRECIATE IT- WE STILL HAVE- MISERY THIS TASK WHAT QUESTIONS OR MAKE COMMENTS. AND I'M PRETTY SURE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE- WHO STILL WANT TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. AT HER TO HAVE TO HIDE NOW. AT THE TO BRIEF JUST CAN'T MENTION THAT WE DO EXPECT TO. RUN OUT OF OUR CURRENT CASH RESOURCES IN EARLY CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE DO CONTINUE TO SEE RAMP UP IN OUR MONTHLY EXPENDITURES. ARE WE DO HAVE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF OUR STRUCTURES THAT ARE NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR- ALREADY FINISHED CONSTRUCTION. AND WE HAVE THAT FINAL THIRD THERE WILL BE CLEARING. THROUGH RIGHT AWAY YOU TELL ME THE LOCATION. OTHER MAJOR ITSELF HAS THOSE STACK UP. ARE WE WILL BE SEEING ADDITIONAL SPENDING AGAIN THAT THE PROP ONE A. IS NEEDED. TO MEET THAT CASH FLOW IN THE BUDGET YEAR I ONCE WE START ACCESSING. OUR PROP ONE A. I. WE DO EXPECT JUST SPEND IT WITHIN ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OR SO. ALSO THAT IS THE SHORT TERM EXPENDITURE SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JUMP IN AND I APOLOGIZE. FOR MY HIGHER AUDIO ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE CLEAN CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE YOU KNOW THERE WAS A REPRESENTATIVE. PREVIOUS. TO THE- CALIFORNIA YES I'M I'M HERE YOU ARE THERE ARE. QUESTIONS I JUST WANNA GO AHEAD YEAH I'M LIKE A SOME MEMBER FOR I ALSO VERY X. TO SEE THIS. OF US WIDE BE TO EFFORTS- ESPECIALLY IN OUR OUR STATE HIGH IN THE FREEWAY ARE YOU KNOW THIS IS WHY OF THE BIG ISSUES AND DISTRICT- EXISTING LETTER AND LACK OF CONSISTENT TRASH COLLECTION ON OUR HIGHWAYS- SO MY CONSTITUENTS WERE VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS- ANNOUNCEMENT AS I WAS I'M I HAVE A QUESTION ON HOW THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED- YOU KNOW PART OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION- YOU HAVE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION FOR LITERA BATEMAN ACTIVITIES AND STRENGTHENING TRASH COLLECTION. DOES ALL OF THAT FUNDING GO TO CALTRANS AND IF SO HOW IS THAT ALLOCATED IS IT DOES GO TO THEIR DISTRICT OFFICES AND THEN- THE TEAMS THERE DECIDE WHAT PART OF THEIR DISTRICT HAS. THE MOST NEED OR HOW DOES THAT WORK. SURE SO. HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I AND MY NAME IS WENDY HARTLEY CALTRANS AND- SO THAT PROPOSAL REALLY OUTLINED AN OVERALL WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PROPOSAL CASH TRANSACTION I SPEND OVER A HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY ON TRASH. EVERY YEAR WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR TRASH COLLECTION AND IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR US TO YOUR COMMENT. AND THAT IT SEEMS AS IF WE'RE NOT COLLECTING TRASH AND BUT THE REALITY IS. I OFTENTIMES OUR CREWS ARE WORKING IN AREAS WHERE THEY'RE GETTING HIT WITH TRASH AND THEY'RE PICKING IT UP. I'M IN WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS THAT CAN LOOK AT THE CALTRANS WOULD NEVER OUT THE LOCATION AND SO- IT'S A COMBINATION HOUSE REINFORCES BUT ALSO GROUP THAT WE WORK VERY PROMINENTLY WITH KNOWN AS EMPLOYMENT SOCIAL ENTERPRISES. EITHER GREAT GROUPS THAT WE WORK WITH AND THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL WE WOULD BE CREATING A GREAT DEAL OF JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR EMPLOYMENT SOCIAL ENTERPRISES WHO. ARE BASICALLY ARE BETTER CREWS WILL COME OUT ON TO CALTRAIN SYSTEM THAT WE CONTRACT WITH THEM BUT THESE ARE FOLKS WHO COME WHO ARE OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO WORK. PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- REENTERING SOCIETY FROM INCARCERATION ACCEPT JOBS AND SO THEY WORK THROUGH THESE GROUPS WILL ALSO HELP PROVIDE ACCESS TO TRAINING AND HOUSING- AND TOOL SO THAT THEY CAN GET ON TO A BETTER CHAPTER OF THEIR LIFE. ALSO THROUGH THAT PROGRAM THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE FOLKS TO GROW INTO POSITIONS WITH CALTRANS. THEY WERE INTRODUCING NEW WELFARE YOUR MATE AND COMPLICATIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE DEDICATED THE WEATHER ABATEMENT CREWS IN EACH OF OUR TWELVE DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. CURRENTLY WE'RE REDIRECTING EXISTING MAINTENANCE CREWS TO PICK UP TRASH WHILE THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS OTHER SPEAKING AND MAINTENANCE NEEDS ON THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL CALTRANS WOULD BE DEVELOPING DEDICATED LETTER CRUZ. THAT WOULD BE WORKING WITHIN THE DISTRICT BUT WOULD BE WORKING AND ALL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT TRASH GENERATING AREAS. AND ACROSS EVERY THERE THERE WOULD NOT BE A ROUTE A STATE ROUTER IN YOUR STATE THAT AT THE LAST OUT OF THE EQUATION WHEN IT COMES TO LITTER ABATEMENT. AND SO WE WOULD BE WORKING OUR OUR REGIONAL OFFICES WOULD BE WORKING TO IDENTIFY THE GREATEST. NEEDS BEST A FREQUENCY OF TRASH WHY ACROSS THE STATE WHAT A- AND THAT WOULD BE THROUGH THE COUNT. FORCE BUT ALL THROUGH THAT THE CON. THAT WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT BUT ENTERPRISE. SO WE ALREADY THESE ARE X. CON. CONTRACTORS RIGHT YOU ALREADY THESE PER. SET UP. OR WILL THERE BE A OP. FOR NEW. OF THE SOCIAL ENTERPRISE- TO JOIN THIS PROGRAM. WE ARE ALREADY WORKING WITH A HANDFUL BUT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND OUR PARTNERSHIPS AND WORK WITH MORE MORE GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CONSERVATION CORPS I CENTERS FOR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ANOTHER SO WE'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH THEM AND I'M HAPPY BUT THAT'S WOULD GREATLY AND INCREASE OUR OUR WORK IN THE STATE. OKAY GREAT- OUT. I HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS ON YOU KNOW THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS THAT ARE- ON THE HIGHWAYS- I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT SOMETIMES WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE ABANDONED RIGHT LIKE- MAYBE THE PERSON EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FOUND HOME OR OR WAS PLACED IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BUT THEN- ITEMS REMAIN BEHIND AND I KNOW I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THAT REQUIRES OR COULD POTENTIALLY REQUIRE HAZARDOUS WASTE CREW- AND SO I WASN'T SURE IF THE- IF THAT'S A SEPARATE. PROGRAM OR IN SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN YOUR BUDGET I KNOW IN A PREVIOUS BUDGET SUB THREE HEARING WE DID HEAR FROM CALTRANS WHERE THEY WERE REQUESTING I THINK IT WAS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR HAS YOU KNOW CONTRACTORS- THAT SPECIALIZE IN HAZARDOUS WASTE THAT MAYBE YOUR CREWS DON'T HAVE THE TRAINING YOU KNOW TO CLEAN. OUT AND SO DOES THIS FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN IS THIS FOR EIGHTEEN MILLION SEPARATE JUST FOR LETTER OR DOES THIS ALSO IS ALL LUMPED IN AND INCLUDES THE HAZARDOUS WASTE. NINE NINE NUMBER HAZARDOUS WASTE SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE CLEANING I'M NOT ENCAMPMENTS BY PEOPLE EITHER BEEN RELOCATED SUCCESSFULLY OR OUT IN ADVANCE I MEAN CAN'T. DESCRIBE BUT IT'S NOT PART OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION. IT OR THAT. IT IS A PART OF THAT HORRENDOUS OKAY THAT'S THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS. I KNOW I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND LOOKING FORWARD. TO SEEING THE RESULTS OF IT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS AND FOR CLARIFIED SOME THINGS FOR ME- THE ONLY OTHER COMMENTS I HAD WERE ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. I'M NOT REALLY ANY QUESTIONS JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS. YOU KNOW SOME COMMENTS THAT YOU KNOW I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK OUR CURRENT APPROACH. IS NOT WORKING. I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER YOU KNOW HAVING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT STEPS WE COULD TAKE. UP TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MOVING FORWARD IN A WAY THAT MAKES FISCAL SENSE- YEAH I REMAIN CONCERNED THAT. THE MATH DOESN'T ADD UP FOR THE HSR PROJECT- I HOPE THAT WERE ABLE TO GET FEDERAL ASSISTANCE NO SIGNIFICANT. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE- IF ESPECIALLY IF OUR COUNTRY WANTS. THIS PROJECT TO BE A MODEL NATIONWIDE FOR WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL- BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO BALANCE- YOU KNOW AS LEGISLATORS HOW MUCH ARE CONSTITUENTS WILL BE ON THE HOOK. FOR INCLUDING- INCLUDING THOSE THAT LIVE IN LESS AFFLUENT COMMITTEE COMMITTEES FOR YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ARE WE CAN BE ON THE HOOK FOR THIS PROJECT- THERE ARE OTHER APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED THAT CAN INCREASE WELL RIDERSHIP AND I HOPE THAT. THOSE WILL BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE. INTO THIS. THE REMAINING BUDGET DISCUSSIONS. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I AM GOING TO. MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT BROADBAND JUST TO RETURN TO THAT TOPIC VERY BRIEFLY- WE REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO HAVE A FULLER. A DISCUSSION OF MY QUESTIONS SO I'LL ASK- WHOEVER IT IS THAT- NEEDS TO RESPOND TO THEM TO PLEASE DO SO WITH ME OFFLINE- BUT- ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS- WE KNOW THAT- MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S. STILL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND- AND THE AND THE REASON IS THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE SERVICE AND SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO BRING. A CABLE TO PEOPLE'S HOMES ULTIMATELY BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO NARROW THAT- ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY. AND DUG OUT THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE HAS TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY- IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE RELYING ON A CABLE AND ASSUMING THAT- THE PUBLIC WILL CONNECT TO THE CABLE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND WILL ACCESS- HIGH SPEED DATA- BROADBAND. IN IN DOING SO. BUT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S WHERE THE PUBLIC IS TODAY- I THINK I LIKE IT A LOT OF PEOPLE- ACCESS THE INTERNET AND UTILIZED BROADBAND OR UTILIZED THEIR- OTHER PERSONAL DEVICES- UGH UGH FOR ACCESSING THE INFORMATION AND THE THING SO THAT WE ALL TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY AND SO. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT DATA IS OUT THERE SUPPORTING THE INVESTMENT OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- I'M NOT SAYING WE ARE BUT I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE NOT INVESTING IN WHAT ULTIMATELY WILL BE AN OBSOLETE TECHNOLOGY BY THE TIME WE ACTUALLY FINISH BUILDING CUT- THE SYSTEMS OUT OF WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE CUSTOME BASE WILL BE THERE FOR THE SERVICES SO IF I COULD GET SOME- FEEDBACK ON THAT CONCERN I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. AND I WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE PATIENCE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING TO GIVE THEIR PUBLIC- COMMENT FOR- ARE PERHAPS HOURS NOW AND- WE WILL NOW- OF A MOVE TO THAT. IF THERE IS ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO SPEAK UP PLEASE STEP FORWARD MAINTAINING SOCIAL DISTANCE I'M SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU UP ONCE AT ONE TIME BUT- I DON'T THINK IT'S OKAY JUST.
