HAVE SIX BILLS ON THE AGENDA TODAY ITEM THREE SB ONE FORTY EIGHT BY CENTER GLAZER HAS BEEN PULLED AT THE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR. AS BEFORE -- EXCUSE ME ITEM FOR AS TO ONE FIFTY BY SENATOR BILL HAS ALSO BEEN PULLED AT THE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR. AND ITEM SIX S. C. R. SIX BY SENATOR NIELSEN IS ON CONSENT SO WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM BUT SENATOR ROBB A SEE YOU THERE PLEASE COME ON UP [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST LET ME. SAY BEFORE I FORGET THAT -- I AM DELIGHTED TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO TO THE BILL REGARDING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THANK YOU SIR. AS YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN WIDELY REPORTED THAT OUR SUPPLY OF OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHAT'S CONSIDERED ADEQUATE TO MEET PATIENT NEEDS AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE PRESSING TO INCREASE COVERAGE UP AND DOWN THE STATE. PROMISING. THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT THEY WILL GET CARE WHEN THE SUPPLY OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IS SIMPLY NOT THERE IN ORDER. TO PROVIDE THE CARE PARTICULARLY IN SOME GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS OF THE STATE THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIRE IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH JUST THIRTY FIVE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS FAR FEWER THAN THE RECOMMENDED. RANGE OF SIXTY TO EIGHTY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER THAT SAME ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION GIVEN THE CURRENT TREND TO THEY SAY THAT WE WILL BE FOUR THOUSAND TO EIGHT THOUSAND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SHORT IN THIS STATE. OVER THE NEXT DECADE OR TWO SO. WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT AND HOW DO WE REVERSE THAT TREND WILL WE SEE YOU -- STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN BY AUTHORIZING THE INITIAL STATE FUNDING FOR THE MEDICAL SCHOOL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. UCR'S FOR YEARS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND WHEN IT OPENED IT WAS THE FIRST NEW PUBLIC MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THIS STATE IN MORE THAN FORTY YEARS. SINCE ITS OPENING THE SCHOOL HAS GRADUATED EIGHTY NINE STUDENTS WITH MD DEGREES FORTY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FORTY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BUT WE CLEARLY NEED MORE GIVEN THE STATISTICS THAT I REFERENCED. DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AT THE TIME YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS FORCED TO OCCUPY AN EXISTING FACILITY ON YOU SEE OURS CAMPUS. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY HAS LIMITED ITS CLASS SIZE TO ABOUT SIXTY STUDENTS PER ACADEMIC YEAR. AND OF COURSE STATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL HAS BEEN LIMITED TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR. IMPACTING THE SCHOOL'S ABILITY TO REALIZE ITS PUBLIC MISSION. IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK FOR THE COMMITTEE TO NOTE THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. MOST OTHER PUBLIC MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE SCALED TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY STUDENTS PER CLASS OR MORE. EXPANSION OF THIS USE YOUR MEDICAL SCHOOL IS URGENTLY NEEDED IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. UP AND DOWN THE STATE NOW FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BILL WOULD APPROVE THE EXPANSION OF THE YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. FROM ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IF APPROPRIATE AT A COST OF EIGHTY MILLION DLLARS. AND WOULD INCREASE THE ANNUAL OPERATIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT EXPANSION AGAIN F APPROPRIATED THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I HAVE. TWO WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY DEAN DEPUTIES THE DATE OF THE USE YOUR MEDICAL SCHOOL TO PROVIDE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS AND ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. AND ONE OF YOU SEE OURS OUTSTANDING AREAS TO OFFER SOME BRIEF COMMENTS AS WELL MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER ROTH AND BEFORE WE GET TO YOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I NOTICE A QUORUM SO MADAM SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LEYVA.

WHILE WE ARE YOUNG MEDICAL SCHOOL I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE HAVE ALREADY MADE A DOWN PAYMENT ON THIS MISSION. ALL STUDENTS ARE RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE COME FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS AND INCLUDE MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILIES TO COMPLETE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. ALL STUDENTS IN BODY THE COMMUNITY OF FUTURE PHYSICIANS THAT WE ARE TRAINING. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF WHERE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES IS WHERE HE AYE SHE GREW UP. AND COMPLETED TRAINING. UP THE GRADUATES AND SOON TO BE GRADUATES MORE THAN 80% ARE PURSUING RESIDENCY TRAINING IN CALIFORNIA. WITH MORE THAN TWO THIRDS REMAINING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND NEARLY A THIRD IN THE INLAND SAID IN CALIFORNIA I INLAND EMPIRE. THE STATE INVESTMENT IN THIS MEDICAL SCHOOL IS PAYING DIVIDENDS FOR OUR POSITION WORKFORCE NEEDS. AND ESPECIALLY THE NEEDS OF THE REGION. THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT PROVIDED IN SB FIFTY SIX BOTH THE ONGOING OPERATING FUNDS AND THE BUILDING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. TO ALLOW YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO FULLY REALIZE THIS MISSION. THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH FORCE WORK COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION IN PART CALLED FOR INCREASED PROMINENCE OPERATING RESOURCES TO EXPAND YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SAN ROMAN. AND A CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO IN ABLE TO GROW. WE ARE GRATIFIED BY THE COMMISSION'S RECOGNITION OF HOW YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING THE HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGE. TODAY YOU'LL ALSO BE HEARING FROM ONE OF PHAM MEDICAL STUDENT FRANCISCO FOR FAR YES. WHO WILL BE GRADUATING MAY THIRTY FIRST HE IS FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE ATTENDED YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND WILL BE TRAINING IN A PRIMARY CARE FIELD? THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF SB FIFTY SIX AND I AM PLEASED TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. OKAY. HI GOOD MORNING HONORABLE CHAIR -- CENTER EARLY BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS FRANCISCO FOR THE US AND I AM CURRENTLY A FOURTH YEAR MEDICAL STUDENT AT THE UC OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. BY TWO THIRDS OF MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE ALSO STRONG TIES TO THE INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION. I GREW UP IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND ATTENDED NORCO HIGH SCHOOL AND AFTERWARDS CAME TO MY DEGREE IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES FROM CALIFORNIA POLYTECHNIC STATE UNIVERSITY IN POMONA. WHEN I HEARD THAT YOU SEE ARE WAS OPENING THEIR VERY OWN MEDICAL SCHOOL I WAS ECSTATIC? BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT ONLY FOR ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND PRACTICE MEDICINE. BUT IT WOULD ALLOW ME TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY THAT RAISED ME. AS THE FIRST GENERATION MEXICAN AMERICAN IN THE FIRST PERSON IN MY FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE. I CAN NEVER IMAGINED ATTENDING A FOR YOUR MEDICAL SCHOOL ESPECIALLY MY OWN COMMUNITY. CAN I CAN DECLARE WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT USE YOUR SCHOOL MEDICINE. I AM NOT THE EXCEPTION. RATHER I AM PART OF THE DIVERSE AND REALLY GROUP STRIVING TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. DO NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT FOR THE NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. REPRESENTED IN MEDICINE 56% OF OUR CLASSES PRICE OF FUTURE WOMEN DOCTORS. AND 40% OF MY COLLEAGUES HAIL FROM EDUCATIONALLY AND OR SOCIAL ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. I BELIEVE THAT A DIVERSE WORKFORCE IS ESSENTIAL TO HELPING THE AFOREMENTIONED POPULATIONS NOT ONLY IN THE REGION BUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE AS WELL. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY AREAS AT WHICH YOU SEE OUR EXCELS. IN ADDITION AS A MEDICAL STUDENT I PARTICIPATED IN THE MARRIOTT OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT SERVE THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. THE FREE CLINICS IN RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY'S WELL. AND THIS ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE FREE HEALTH CARE TO A POPULATION WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. ALL THESE EXPERIENCES SERVE TO DEFINE MY FUTURE AMBITIONS AND ETHOS IS A POSITION. HAVING RECENTLY COMPLETED MY RESIDENCY INTERVIEWS. I HAD THE PLEASURE SPEAKING WITH MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY CAN I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT YOU SEE ARE IS A SPECIAL PLACE COMMITTED TO THREE PRONG MISSION OF SERVICE TEACHING AND RESEARCH. I AM CURRENTLY PURSUING A RESIDENCY IN GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE THAT ALLOWS ME TO BUILD ME FORM LASTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY PATIENTS AND MY COMMUNITY. AS I DISCOVERED THROUGHOUT MY FOUR YEARS OF HIGH CALIBER MEDICAL EDUCATION AT UC RIVERSIDE. THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF MY JOY AND SATISFACTION MEDICINE. MORE IMPORTANTLY I ONCE IN A MORE THAN READY TO SERVE IN THE INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION. WHICH IS AND WILL FOREVER REMAIN MY HOME. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AND I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL. FIFTY SIX AND HELP US TO CONTINUE TO BUILD THE TEXT AND RATIONS OF PHYSICIANS AND EXPAND ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE IN OUR REGION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FRANCISCO AS A RESIDENT OF MAKING US ALL PROUD HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY. OTHERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- JEFF AKA REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS ON THE TWENTY THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUPERINTENDENTS AND THE COUNTY. US SENATOR ROTH HAS OUTLINED THE GREAT NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE -- WE SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A WELL DOCUMENTED LINK BETWEEN STUDENT WELLNESS AN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. BUT WE SEE THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL AS IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND THEN WE ALSO SEE IT AS INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS -- WITH REGARD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAREER PATHWAYS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIOUS MEDICAL FIELDS. SO WE THANK SENATOR ROTH FOR BEING A CHAMPION OF THE PROJECT AND ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. FORGET TO HAVE ANYONE IN SUPPORT FROM THE AUDIENCE. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. MAX PAVE THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SEEING NO OTHERS IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NO ONE SENATOR ROTH WHICH I TOOK WELL BEFORE YOU CLOSE SORRY. TAKE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CENTER PAN. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH TERROR LEYVA -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT THANK YOU CENTER OFFER BRING THIS BEFORE US -- AS A MEDICAL EDUCATOR I WAS SIR YOU SEE DAVIS AND SERVED ON THE ACGME BOARD AND HOW IMPORTANT MEDICAL EDUCATION IS. IN TERMS OF OUR WORK FOR SUPPLY. I GUESS ONE QUESTIONS AFTER THE DEAN IS IS THAT -- THAT. CAN YOU JUST MAYBE TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- IN TERMS OF YOUR FUNDING RELATION TO TEACHING HOSPITALS AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH -- THE ENTRY OF THE CLINICAL CAPACITY SO PART OF THE TRAINING IS NOT JUST LECTURE HALLS TO GIVE TALKS A IT'S ALSO ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVING CLINICAL SITES FOR ALL THE STUDENTS TO BE ABLE IT IN TERMS OF THE EXPANSION. SELECTED AVAILABILITY CLINICAL SITES THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT'S MEDICAL STUDENT TRAINING IT'S NOT JUST THE IN CLASS SOME EDUCATION. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A CLINICAL PLATFORM FOR ALL STUDENTS TO LEARN THAT CLINICAL SKILLS AND WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. IS THAT OUR STUDENTS BEGAN TO GET CLINICAL EXPERIENCE ONE MONTH ACTED THEY MATRICULATED INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL WE ASSIGN THEM TO VARIOUS POSITIONS IN THE AREA AND THEY STAY WITH THAT POSITION. FOR THREE YEARS BEFORE PLATFORM REQUIRES US TO FORM MULTIPLE AFFILIATIONS WITH VARIOUS HOSPITALS AS WELL AS HAVING A CLINICAL PLATFORM AT UC RIVERSIDE. OKAY SO IT BASICALLY THAT'S THAT CERTAINLY -- AT ONE POINT ELEMENT I DISCUSS WHAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT -- THIS IS WELL CERTAINLY VITAL FUNDING FOR SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S ACTUALLY A LARGER COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU TAP INTO. TO TO TRAIN OUR STUDENTS AND OF ITS GO THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE ACTUALLY -- DO YOU MIND IF YOU DO I SHOW THIS FOR YOU MATCHED AND I KNOW MATCH DAY WAS THAT LAST WEEK. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO I ENDED UP MATCHING TO UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE OKAY. AND A GREAT PROGRAM OF THEIR BILL EXPECTING TO COME BACK. ON AND SO WHAT THAT -- AGAIN I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- AND THAT'S YOU KNOW A FULL SIZE MEDICAL SCHOOL YOU'RE RIGHT GENERALLY YOU'RE PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT IN THE LONG YOU KNOW ONE HUNDRED HUNDRED TWENTY ANY SOME SCHOOLS OF COURSE LARGER -- GENERATES ABOUT -- CAN GENERATE YOU KNOW OVER BILLION SOMETHING AVERAGE TWO BILLION -- OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE REGION SO THAT THAT'S ALSO AND VERY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DRIVER. FOR FOR THE COMMUNITY AS WELL SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY MOVE AT THE PROFIT TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SENATOR DORADO. YES THANK YOU IS IT FORTY S. IDEA STATUS OF THANK YOU MISTER FOR THE S. AND SENATOR ROTHSTEIN EVERYONE WHO'S HERE. THIS IS REALLY A GREAT UP PROPOSAL -- BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU AND IN PARTICULAR -- AS WE LOOK TO AS YOU LOOK TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THOUGHT THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL. AND WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT NEED ACROSS THE STATE THIS WILL BE STATEWIDE. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? ANY ONE THING THAT THE SCHOOL COULD DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH DIVERSITY. COMING IN YOU KNOW A POOL. OF A DIVERSE STUDENTS -- SO THAT THEY CAN GO TO THE SCHOOL AND GRADUATING COME BACK AS AS YOU SAID BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT NEED ALL OVER. WHETHER TO EAST LA OR FRESNO SO MANY PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE A NEED FOR DOCTORS -- SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON THAT. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER SET THE AND UP. WITH SMALLER NUMBERS AT YOUR LOCAL. YES ABSOLUTELY SO I THINK THE STRATEGY OUR SCHOOL IS IS TAKEN UP TO THIS POINT -- HAS BEEN REALLY PHENOMENAL IN THE SENSE THAT. THEY REALLY FOCUSING IN ON GIVING PRIORITY TO RESIDENTS OF THE SAY WHO HAVE STRONG TIES TO THE REGION. AND I THINK THAT THAT TRULY DOES PER ME AS FAR AS WHAT THE FUTURE AMBITIONS ALL OF OUR CLASS ARE AS THE HOLES. I WOULD CONTINUE. TO SELECT STUDENTS WITH THAT TYPE OF FILTER IN MIND -- IT'S BUILT IN IN INTO OUR INTERVIEW PROCESS I HAD THE PLEASURE OF INTERVIEWING A PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS WHO ARE APPLYING OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL IN IT VERY MUCH IS ENTRENCHED. INTO THE SELECTION PROCESS IS TRYING TO PICK OUT THE STUDENTS THAT WE FEEL DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT NOT ONLY TO THE MISSION BUT TO THE AREA. I THINK IN DOING SO -- IT DOES SELECT FOR A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO. ARE MORE PRONE TO REALLY ENTRENCHING THEMSELVES IN THE COMMUNITY AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE VARIOUS -- OPPORTUNITIES THAT THERE ARE IN THE COMMUNITY TO SERVE THAT FOR THERE'D BE FREE CLINICS -- BECAUSE THIS IS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCES YOU WANTED TAILORED TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO WANT THAT EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU. ADD TO THAT PLEASE YES PLEASE SURE. I'M I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IS VERY ENGAGED IN THE COMMUNITY AND AS SUCH WE'RE FEELING THAT WE ARE GROWING OUR OWN. BEING THAT WE ARE BUILDING A PIPELINE OF STUDENTS WE HAVE PIPELINE PROGRAMS THAT GO ALL THE WAY TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR STUDENTS TO GET TO COLLEGE AND ASKING THEM. TO ENGAGE HER THINK ABOUT HEALTHCARE THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. SO ALL PIPELINE PROGRAM IS EXTENSIVE WE SEE AN AVERAGE OF ALMOST A THOUSAND STUDENTS WITHIN THE YEAR. AND WE UTILIZE SOME OF OUR CURRENT MEDICAL STUDENTS TO GO INTO THE SCHOOLS WITH US IN INTO THE COMMUNITIES WITH US SO THAT THOSE STUDENTS CAN SEE WHAT THEY CAN BE. AND THEY LOOK AT OUR STUDENTS AS ROLE MODELS AND THEY BECOME ENTHUSIASTIC AND ENGAGE IN INTERESTED IN PURSUING CAREERS IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. A GOOD THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER.

GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND AN MEMBERS -- I INVITE YOU TO START WHENEVER YOU'RE READY I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS BILL A SB TWO TWENTY THREE MAY LOOK FAMILIAR TO MANY OF YOU IT WAS A PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR -- AND IT IS -- DESIGNED TO HELP STUDENTS WITH SEVERE MEDICAL DISABILITIES ATTEND SCHOOL OFTEN THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT WORKS FOR SOME OF THE STUDENTS IS THAT MEDICAL CANNABIS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICAL CANNABIS TO THEM IN NON SMOKING AND NON VAPING FORMS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH OFTEN OCCURS DURING SCHOOL HOURS. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS THE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THEIR PARENTS SIGNED OUT AND TAKEN OFF CAMPUS IN FACT OVER THOUSAND FEET AWAY. IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINE THIS IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR LEARNING. SB TWO TWENTY THREE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF A QUE TO THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION OR CHARTER SCHOOL TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY IT IS NOT A STATE MANDATE. DISTRICTS OR AND COUNTIES THAT OPT IN THE CAN OPT OUT FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING THE FEDERAL FUNDING IS PUT AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THIS POLICY. SB TWO TWENTY THREE REQUIRES THE STUDENTS TO BE A STUDENT TO BE A QUALIFIED MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION TYPICALLY THE MEDICINE IS ADMINISTRATORS OIL. AT CAPSULES DENTURES LIQUIDS OR TOPICAL CREAMS ENVIRONMENT AND MUST TAKE ALL CANNABIS FROM SCHOOL GROUNDS AFTER ADMINISTRATION. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO LEGALLY ADMINISTER ANY PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS INCLUDING OPIOIDS THE CHILD HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED BUT THERE ARE MEDICAL CONDITIONS PHARMACEUTICALS CAN'T FIX. AND OFTEN HAVE DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS MEDICAL CANNABIS HELPS FILL SOME OF THESE GAPS AND LESS IN THESE CHALLENGING SIDE EFFECTS PARENTS ACROSS THE NATION. HAVE HAD SUCCESS TREATING THEIR CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL CANNABIS WHEN NO PHARMACEUTICAL WOULD WORK WASHINGTON COLORADO FLORIDA MAINE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ALL PASSED LEGISLATION ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU.

SINCE THE AGE OF THREE MONTHS OLD HE HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH EPILEPSY. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LENNIX BECAUSE THOSE SYNDROME. THIS EPILEPSY IS VERY RARE. AND HARD TO CONTROL JO JO WAS MEDICATED WITH HIGH DOSES OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND ALSO FITTED WITH A DEVICE CALLED THE VAGUS NERVE STIMULATOR. ALL WITH NO SUCCESS. I WAS WATCHING MY SON DIE RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY. I BEGAN RESEARCHING CANNABIS AND THE EFFECTS OF IT TO TREAT EPILEPSY. AND TWO AND CHOSE TO TRIED AS OUR LAST RESORT. WE HAD TO GET A WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM MARTYROLOGIES PRIOR TO SEEKING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA -- RECOMMENDATION. AND ALSO A DOCTOR TO TREAT MINORS NOT ALL DO. FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS THE FIRST TIME WE TRIED CANNABIS DIDN'T SEEM VERY HOPEFUL. DAY BY DAY I SEEN THEM EMERGE FROM IS MEDICATED STATE START ENGAGING AGAIN SEIZURES WERE DECREASED IMMEDIATELY. I SUPPORT THIS BILL TO TO JUDGE -- NEEDING A DOES THAT SCHOOL TWELVE P.. I FEEL CAN IS SHOULD BE TREATED AS EVERY OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ON SCHOOL CAMPUS IT IS NOT FAIR THAT THIS MEDICINE IS SAVED MY SON'S LIFE. AND NOT BE GIVEN THE SAME ABILITY. AND TREATMENT AS OTHER PHARMACEUTICALS ON ON SCHOOL CAMPUS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS BILL BECOMING LAW. MY SON'S LIFE WITH SO MANY OTHERS DEPEND ON IT. IN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS NO ONE HAS DIED FROM CANNABIS USE. IT IS THE ONLY MEDICINE THAT CAN TREAT SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ON SUCH A WIDE SPECTRUM FROM EPILEPSY TO ARTHRITIS TO CANCER TO PARKINSON'S. IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REGENERATE BRAIN CELLS THIS SET HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND WITH MY CHILD. ASK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART TO GIVE A YES VOTE TODAY. BE THE VOICE MY SON NEEDS AND SO MANY OTHERS NEED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMPASSION. HUMANS BECAME PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING SENATORS. MY NAME IS JENNIFER KURDISH I AM A WIFE.

AND HE KNOWS HOW TO COUNT. TO TWENTY AND HE'S IN A GARDEN SCHOOL -- THE MIRACLE MEDICATION THAT SAVED HIS LIFE IT'S REQUIRED FOR SEIZURE CONTROL WITHOUT FORCING HIM OUT OF THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF OUTDATED LAWS AND MISINFORMATION. TODAY IS DAY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. EACH DAY WE GO TO SCHOOL TO POINT OUT OF CLASS WALKING A THOUSAND FEET FROM CAMPUS. AND GIVEN THAT TO BRING HIM BACK. THIS WHOLE PROCESS TAKES ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AND THAT'S ON A GOOD DAY. THAT ACCOUNTS 410% OF HIS DAY AT SCHOOL. SO FAR THIS YEAR THAT LOST TIME EQUALS TO THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY MINUTES OR SIXTY FOUR HOURS OF SCHOOL TIME. AND I HAVEN'T EVEN ADDRESSED THE OTHER TWELVE KIDS IN CLASS THEIR DISRUPTED NOR THE TRANSITION TIME THAT RECALL THAT IS REQUIRED WHEN HE COMES BACK TO CLASS WE HAVE TO PULL HIM FROM. FROM SCHOOL. BY THE END OF THE YEAR HE WILL LOST ALMOST NINETY HOURS OF SCHOOL TIME JUST SO THAT HE CAN RECEIVE HIS MEDICATION IT MAKES AVAILABLE TO LEARN. HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE IS MET ON CAMPUS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CHILD WE ARE CURRENTLY BEING FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIS MEDICAL NEEDS AND THE EDUCATION THAT HE REQUIRES. IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE AND I BELIEVE IT MUST BE CHANGED PLEASE ALLOW ZACHRY TO REGAIN LOST 10% OF SCHOOL TIME IN VOTE YES ON THIS BILL.

AND REINVESTMENT INTO EXISTING FACILITIES IN OUR IN OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN OUT OF THE TEN BILLION ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT WOULD ADDRESS SEISMIC SAFETY IN THE CSU. AND THAT TEN BILLION IS A CONSTRAINT NUMBER BECAUSE WE LIMIT HOW MANY PROJECTS THE CAMPUS CAN REQUEST SO THERE'S PROBABLY GREATER NEED BUT BASED ON THE AVAILABLE FUNDS WE CONSTRAIN THAT AMOUNT. WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR PLAN WE PRODUCE ANNUALLY SO IT HAS A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN THE FIVE YEARS FORWARD. IT INCLUDES THOSE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE. A LOT OF THEM ARE AT POMONA SAN FRANCISCO WITH SOME OF THE FAULT ISSUES IN THOSE AREAS. LOS ANGELES AND AND A IN ADDITION.

SEEING NONE ANY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING THEN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE WHEN I'M THE QUESTION CENTER PAN. THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA -- SO FOR FIRST OF ALL I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE TREMENDOUS NEEDS I SEE THEM THE CAMPUSES IN MY DISTRICT -- I ALSO YOU KNOW DO MAKE NOTE THAT -- THE LAST TIME WE HAD A BOND WAS I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE CERTAINLY I'D IMAGINE THEY SEE THE NEED I SUPPORT -- THIS LEGISLATION BUT WE SEE THIS ALSO K. THROUGH TWELVE ALSO SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE DO SORT OF THE BIG BANG BOND HER EIGHT SO AND THIS IS GOING TO COST US FOUR HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR SO YOU KNOW IT'S EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR BOND FOR TWO MILLION A YEAR. FOR THE TO PAY BACK BOND. HOWEVER GENERAL FUND THEN -- DO WE HAVE IS IS THERE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT. LIKE TO JUST DO THIS X. EVERY EX NUMBER YEARS OR IS THERE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT A MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY OF HANDLING -- THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT. SO SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE A GAP AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING -- BUT ALSO -- THIS IN ITSELF. AND YOU SAID THE NEEDS STILL GREATER THAN WHAT'S IN THIS BOND IS NOT SERVE AN ON GOING APPROACH AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT EVERYTHING HAS TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING BUT SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TOPIC I WAS WONDERING WHETHER MAYBE PERHAPS. SOME OF THE WITNESSES MIGHT WANNA DRESS -- WHAT YOU SEE IS? HOW WOULD YOU TAKE CARE OF? THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS THE ONGOING IS BECAUSE THE BUILT BUILDINGS WILL CONTINUE TO WEAR OUT AGENT SO FORTH RIGHT DAVE BEYOND -- SUMI THIS PASSES. ANYONE WANT TO ANSWER. PLEASE PROCEED -- PANEL ALL TAKES OUT THERE'S NO EASY ANSWER THERE IT IS THE AMOUNT OF OF FUNDING FOR FOR A MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITIES. WE ESTIMATED NEED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS BUILDING SYSTEMS THAT HAVE A REACH THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE. AND IN OUR SPORT BUDGET WERE VERY HAPPY MAINTENANCE FOR THE CSU. BUT ALL AS ONGOING BASIS IT WOULD BE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THE TO ADDING FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS MORE. PLUS ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION TO ADDRESS ONGOING NEED AS PART OF OUR BASE BUDGET SO THERE'S NO EASY ANSWER THERE AND IN MY SENSE. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN ANYTHING ELSE. GO AHEAD OF A JUST GOOD AT THE THE FIRST CALIFORNIA WOULD CONCUR WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WILL BE. ADDITIONAL NEEDS ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS I WOULD HOWEVER NOTE THAT -- THE OTHER ARE PROJECTS TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND OUR COLLEAGUES OF CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY ARE FUNDING. INTERNALLY -- TO HELP ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BUT WE DO FEEL THAT -- STATE BOND WOULD BE APPROPRIATE ANALYST PORTIONS SLOWED. OKAY SO I APPRECIATE THOSE ANSWERS I MEAN PART OF IT ALSO WONDERING ABOUT TO WHAT DEGREE DO SHOULD WE DO THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT AND MAYBE IT'S AN SOME. MECHANISM BY WHICH YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TO PUT MONEY TO FOR A BOND OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE FOUR ON ROLLING BOND OR SOME SOME OTHER NATURE SO THAT. BECAUSE THIS IS SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST BECAUSE I SEE THIS AS IMPACT ON THE BUDGET BUT BERSERK BUT IT'S IT'S NOT THE QUESTIONS ALREADY. CONSIDERING THIS AND FOR STRUCTURE PEACE IN OUR CURRENT BUDGETING PROCESS AND MAYBE THAT'S WHICH YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THIS KIND OF MECHANISMS. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU TO MY CO AUTHOR SENATOR WILK AND THE CENTER ALLEN IS JOINTLY AUTHORING THE BILL WITH ME. AND FOR MANY OTHERS WHO RECOGNIZED THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING ARE SO IMPORTANT IN OUR STATE. SO IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY SO IMPORTANT OF THE FAMILIES AND THEIR THEIR KIDS THAT THAT HIGHER EDUCATION FOR THEM -- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A WE HAVE IGNORED THIS PROBLEM. FOR A LONG TIME AND TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION IS SENATOR PAN -- ASKED EARLIER IF WE DON'T HANDLE IT THROUGH -- CAPITAL OUTLAY BOND -- THEN THE PRESSURES ON THE INSTITUTION ARE TO DO IT THEMSELVES WHICH PUTS PROVIDE DIRECT PRESSURE ON TUITION INCREASES -- AT OUR IN OUR SYSTEMS AND THAT'S REALLY THE BACKSTOP THAT IF WE DON'T ACT THAT THEY WILL AND IT'S NOT THE ACT THAT THAT THE RECOURSE WE'D LIKE TO SEE. THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT BY THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF US BECAUSE OF THEIR IMPORTANCE TO OUR STATE. NOT JUST FOR THE KIDS IN THE FAMILIES BUT FOR ALL OF US AT SUPPORT THAT ALL OF US INVEST IN THE PAINT MAINTENANCE OF THOSE FACILITIES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BOND DOES IT DOES PUT ON THE BALLOT. FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE YES THERE IS A OPERATING COST OBLIGATION. BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THAT STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL BE THE ONES TO BEAR THE SPECIFIC BURDEN. OF EARTHQUAKE SAFETY AND FIRE SAFETY AND FLOOD SAFETY ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ALL OF US WILL SHARE AND THAT AS WE HAVE HISTORICALLY CALIFORNIA AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR IT EITHER.
