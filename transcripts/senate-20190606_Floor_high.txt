EACH OF THEM STOOD AND WATCHED NINETEEN YEAR OLDS AS OTHERS CAME DOWN. AND THEY THEN GRAB THE ROPE AND SKILLED THEMSELVES AND ABOUT THIS TIME THEY FINALLY DEFEATED GERMANS BUT THEY WEREN'T FINISHED. BECAUSE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS STRAIGHT. THEY FACE THE COUNTER ATTACKS OF THE GERMAN FORCES. THE DOOR TWENTY FIVE IS STARTED BY.

I'M A NATIVE CALIFORNIAN MY PARENTS GOT MARRIED VERY EARLY MY MOM GOT MERRY TWO DAYS BEFORE SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY MY DAD AROUND. TWENTY AND THEY MOVED -- TO THE CHEVY HILLS AREA IN AN APARTMENT ON HOME DRIVE -- I THINK MAYBE AND CENTER ALLEN'S DISTRICT. AND THEIR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR WAS AN ITALIAN COUPLE. IAN JOSEPH PREEMIES. AND THEY DEVELOPED A TREMENDOUS FRIENDSHIP AND MARION JOE DECIDED TO MOVE FROM LOS ANGELES TO THIS NEW SUBURB OF LOS ANGELES CALL ANAHEIM. FIVE MILES FROM DISNEYLAND AND BOUGHT WHAT WAS CALLED ANY CINDERELLA HOME. A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE THOUSAND FIFTY SQUARE FEET FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK IN. NINETEEN FIFTY SIX FIFTY SEVEN WELL MY PARENTS LOVED MERION JOKE. AND THEY MOVED. TO GO TO ANAHEIM TO BE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS TO THEM AND THAT'S WHERE I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD IN ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA. AND I HAD A VERY STRONG. AFFECTION FOR JOING MERRY ESPECIALLY JOE WE COMMONLY CALL THEM. UNCLE JOE AN AUNT MARY AND THEY HAD. THREE KIDS JOE JUNIOR RICHARD BERNICE NOW WHO LIVES UP IN THE NAPA AREA AND MARIA -- BERNICE THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE BUT AS I WAS GROWING UP. JOE NEVER TALKED ABOUT. THE MILITARY I NEWS PATRIOTIC HE ALWAYS FLEW THE FLAG ON MEMORIAL DAY VETERANS DAY GOD BLESS YOU AND AS TIME WENT ON MY PARENTS MOVED FROM [inaudible] ANAHEIM TERROR. AT A HOT SPRINGS AND MARY JO FOLLOWED THIS KIND OF UNBELIEVABLE THAT THEY'VE BEEN LIKE FAMILY ALL OF OUR LIVES. AND THEN AS A MARINE JOE WE'RE GETTING OLDER. THEY MOVED CLAREMONT TO BE CLOSER TO THEIR KIDS AND I WAS MADE AWARE OF A STORE. SO. JOE WAS A WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN. AND ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. A FRENCH CITIZEN WAS USING A METAL DETECTOR. ON THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY. AND FOUND A DOG TAG. IN A SAID JOSEPH BERNICE ON IT. AND TURNED IT OVER TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY KNEW WHO THIS MISTER JOE PREMIES WAS. ANYONE IS IF HE WAS STILL ALIVE. AND WHAT WE LATER FOUND OUT WAS THAT [inaudible] JOE. WAS ON THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY. AND WAS BLOWN OUT [inaudible] SURVIVE. AND WENT TO A MILITARY HOSPITAL IN GERMANY FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS. AND THEN FLEW HOME. TO BE WITH HIS WIFE. AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. HE RE ENLISTED BACK AND FOUGHT IN THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE AFTER ALMOST LOSE LIFE. THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TRACK HIM DOWN. AND SALUTE HIM. AND HIS SON FIRST CLASS ON AIR FRANCE [inaudible] THE PARIS. TO RECOGNIZE HIM. THEY GIVE HIM THE HIGHEST HONOR. THAT A NON CITIZEN OF FRANCE COULD EVER GET FOR HERE IS -- AND BRAVERY. THIS SHOWS YOU THE KIND OF DEDICATION. THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY. THAT EXISTED IN THE GREATEST GENERATION OF ALL. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE D. DAY INVASION WAS A TURNING POINT. IN THE WORLD WAR TWO WAR WITHOUT IT. THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE MAYBE GERMAN SPEAKING TODAY AND A POWER FOR WHICH WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. SO MY FRIENDS AS WE RECOGNIZE THIS VERY IMPORTANT DAY -- I WANT TO JUST PAY TRIBUTE TO ALL THOSE MEN AND WOMEN. THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES ON THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY THERE WERE MANY OF WHOM WERE SITTING DUCKS. AS A FLOOD THAT BE CHAPTER. THE SEAS WERE SO ROUGH COMING IN FROM ENGLAND MANY OF THEM GOT OFF THOSE TRANSPORTERS SICK FROM JUST BEING SEASICK. BOB DOLE WITHOUT THEIR HEROISM WITHOUT THE INVASION -- WE WOULD NOT I BELIEVE OF THE COMMENT AND AND DEFEATING FASCISM AND COMMUNISM -- AND THE DASTARDLY. HEINOUS CRIMES OF ADOLF HITLER THAT HAD A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON MY FAMILY. SO IN HONOR OF ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN COURAGEOUSLY OF SERVED ESPECIALLY THOSE.

OF MY COLLEAGUES -- FROM SANTA ANA. OF PHILLIP PARATROOPER WEARS HIS WINGS AS I WEAR MINE. AND I'M SO PROUD TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. BUT IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM. THERE'S A WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN -- SIR WOULD YOU PLEASE STAND UP. ON HIS HAT HE HAS THE PATCH OF THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE. MY OLD OUTFIT CALL HIM A BAND OF BROTHERS. AIR TO PURSUE SERVE WITH THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE AND OF COURSE THE HUNDRED AND FIRST. BUT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU. MISTER PRESIDENT. THAT I AM IN SUPPORT. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT ALL OF US KNOW THAT. THE INVASION AND EUROPE -- KNOWN AS THE DAY. WAS SO DETRIMENTAL. TO OUR SUCCESS IN EUROPE. BUT THE HEROISM THAT THESE MEN. WHO -- IN THIS CASE I'VE GOT A HIGHLIGHT THESE PARATROOPERS BECAUSE OF A DEBT OF GRATITUDE IS OWED TO THEM. THE BAND OF BROTHERS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. THE RANGERS WHO SCALE THE THE MOUNTAINSIDE TO GET UP TO THE TOP. BUT LET ME SHARE WITH YOU. SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. THIRTEEN THOUSAND PARATROOPERS JUMPED. INTO FRANCE BEHIND ENEMY LINES. BUT I ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE AIRMEN IN THOSE AIRPLANES. THE ARMY AIR CORPS. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. OVER. SIX THOUSAND THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE. PARTICIPATED MANY MANY WERE WOUNDED AND KILLED. BUT LISTEN TO THIS A FLEET. OF THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE AIRCRAFT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE C.. FORTY SEVEN DROP THESE PARATROOPERS BEHIND THE LINES -- THAT ONE OH FIVE I'M SORRY AT ONE FIFTY ONE IN THE MORNING THAT STATE MERRY PLEASED WITH THE EIGHTY SECOND. BUT THE FACT IS THAT SO MANY OF THESE PLANES WERE SHOT DOWN. FORTY TWO AIRCRAFT WERE LOST. IMAGINE LADIES IN GERMAN FORTY TWO AIRCRAFT FILLED WITH PARATROOPERS. AND ARMY AIR CORPSMAN. FORTY TWO THESE WERE WERE SHOT DOWN EVEN BEFORE THE JUMP HAPPEN. AND IT IS AMAZING WHAT THEY HAD TO DO EVEN BEFORE THE JUMP ITSELF. THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE ALONG WITH THE HUNDRED AND FIRST AIRBORNE. AS I SAID JUMP BEHIND ENEMY LINES PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE DURING THOSE EARLY DAYS OF FIGHTING. AND STOP THE RESERVES FROM COMING ACROSS IN STOPPING THE INVASION. THEN I STAND HERE'S A FELLOW PARATROOPER GENERATIONS LATER. THE SAY THANK YOU TO THE MEN WHO SERVED OUR GREAT COUNTRY IN WAR THESE WINGS. AND ID LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THEM. THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR. TWO AND OCE AGAIN TO GAVE US THE LIBERTIES AND FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. THAT IT IS ONLY FITTING THAT WE SUPPORT. ALL OF US WHO SERVED IN THE MILITARY OF MEN AND WOMEN AND THOSE WHO ARE SERVING IN UNIFORM TODAY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE FACT THAT ALL OF US CAME TOGETHER AT A TIME. WHEN THEY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE DEFEATED? AFTER DECEMBER SEVENTH NINETEEN FORTY ONE BUT WE ROSE AS A COUNTRY WE ROSE AS AMERICANS. AND WE TOOK BACK. WHAT THEY TRY TO TAKE FROM US OUR FREEDOM OUR LIBERTIES AND SO FOR THAT? I RISE IN SUPPORT. AND ACR FIFTY THREE AND I THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

BUT PROBABLY NOT A HEN HISTORY MUCH MORE. THE DWIGHT EISENHOWER WHO SAID [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] WE'LL GO. THOSE WORDS MUCH. THIS INVASION THAT CHANGED. WORLD HISTORY. WITH THE BURDEN SOLELY ON HIM. THE RESPONSIBILITY ACCEPTED IN A NOTE THAT HE THEN HAD ALREADY DRAFTED. WHERE THAT INVASION? TO FAIL. BUT OTHER EXPERIENCE. IN TO MY ATTENTION AS I WAS READING THE G. MALES OF MY STEPFATHER AFTER HE PASSED AWAY AT G. MAIL WAS A A LITTLE. CARD. TYPE THING THAT THE G. EYES WOULD BE USED TO WRITE TO THE FAMILIES OR THEIR LOVED ONES HOME. AND HE WROTE TO HIS MOTHER AND ACTUALLY EVERY SINGLE DAY. THE SERVER. AS I'M RAMBLING THREE THESE THINGS AND THEY WERE GENERALLY VERY INNOCUOUS BECAUSE THEY WERE. HEAVILY CENSORED. HE'D SAY -- IN ALL OF DID THE COW HAVE A CALF OR YOU KNOW HOW'S THINGS WITH THE CORN CROP. BUT THIS. READ. WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN? WAITING FOR IS HAPPENING. I THINK IT'S GOING WELL. HOW TO THE FOLKS BACK HOME FEEL ABOUT THIS? AND I THOUGHT THAT STRANGE TILL I LOOKED. AT THE DATE. THAT WAS THE DAY. HE WAS IN THE HANDS ARMY AIR CORPS. WHAT WOULD BE CALLED TODAY? AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER. WATCHING. THOSE PLANES. MAYBE EVEN SOME THAT CARRIED THIS GENTLEMAN HERE WHO SERVED IN THE EIGHTY SECOND OR THE FATHERS OF AYE TWO COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY. WHO WERE PARATROOPERS? HE WAS WATCHING THOSE PLANES AND THEN HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE WHO. DID NOT COME BACK. BUT THE UNDERSTATED WAY. THAT HE PLACE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO HIS MOTHER. IS SO TYPICAL OF THAT GREATEST GENERATION. THEY WERE HEROES WHO. TRIED TO AVOID. THE GLORY IN THE BURDEN OF HAIR WAS. THEY WERE HUMBLE MEN AND WOMEN. WHO DIDN'T GO ABOUT TELLING THEIR STORIES? SOMETHING THEIR CHESS. THEY CAME HOME AND HELP BUILD THIS NATION [inaudible] END. OTHER NATIONS EVEN THOSE THE DAY AND SO CONTRIBUTED TO DEFEATING. BUT THOSE MERE WORDS. I THINK IT'S GOING WELL.

THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY ON RONALD REAGAN SPOKE AT NORMANDY BEACH HE JUST SUM THAT UP -- ABOUT WHAT OUR SOLDIERS DID FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WHY HE SAID THEY STRENGTH THEY WERE STRICKEN BY THEIR COURAGE HEARTENED BY THEIR VALOR.

ARE THE POLITICAL PRINCIPLES CONTAIN OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS THE CONSTITUTION A DECLARATION.
