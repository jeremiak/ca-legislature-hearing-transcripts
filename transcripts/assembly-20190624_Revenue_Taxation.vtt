00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:46.317
CHURCH SEPARATE FROM A CHURCH OR

00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:47.652
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION.

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:48.920
AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S REQUIRED

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.421
TO HAVE A LOT OF NODDING GOING

00:34:50.488 --> 00:34:55.026
ON HERE DID I STRIKE A NERVE

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:57.762
SOME.

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:58.763
KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN I DO

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.298
YEAH I JUST I'M.

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:01.966
I MEAN IT'S CALLED SAINT FRANCIS

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.135
AND IS NOT BY ACCIDENT -- WAS A

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:05.236
FRENCH IS WHY NO I GO TO SAN

00:35:05.303 --> 00:35:05.903
FRANCISCO CHURCH IN MY

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:06.838
NEIGHBORHOOD TIME QUITE FAMILIAR

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:07.939
ST FRANCIS WHICH TELLS ME THAT

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:08.906
THIS WAS ON PURPOSE IT WAS NAMED

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:09.440
THIS WAY.

00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:10.675
AND SO IT IS AFFILIATED WITH THE

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:14.278
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SOME WAY AND

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:17.248
I'M JUST ASKING A IN ON WHAT IT

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:19.217
REALLY ASIAN IS IT IN.

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:21.219
IT IS A DISTINCT.

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.620
NONPROFIT AND AND I THINK THE

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:23.488
CONFUSION IS IS THAT -- IT

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:24.922
DOESN'T ACTUALLY FOR THE BILL'S

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:26.991

BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE AND AND

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:50.527
THAT I WAS GOING TO BE STUCK

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:52.296
WITH OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:52.896
DOLLARS WITH THE STUDENT LOAN

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:53.397
DEBT.

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.599
AND I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:57.601
THIS BILL WOULD GREATLY HELP NOT

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.169
ONLY ME.

00:43:59.236 --> 00:43:59.803
BUT MILLIONS OF OTHER STUDENTS

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.172
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.674
HAVE OCCURRED DID ALONG THAT.

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:04.742
I'M SORRY.

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.176
CLEARLY I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:07.277
SUPPORT THIS BILL NOT ONLY FOR

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.013
ME BUT FOR THE MILLIONS OF OTHER

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.180
STUDENTS.

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:13.417
THAT HAVE OCCURRED STUDENT LOAN

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.619
DEBT INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA.

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:18.655
I THINK YOU ADDITIONAL IN THIS

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.657
ISN'T SUPPORT.

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:22.893
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.294
SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:25.963
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.733
DOCTOR PARK -- SENATOR Y. CASKEY

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.301
YOU'VE BEEN MY FRIEND FOR A LONG

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:31.502
TIME.

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:33.170
MIKE IN TYPE TWO CONCERNS WITH

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:35.539
THE BILL FIRST OF ALL IT'S A NON

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:36.407
REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT.

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:38.075
AND ARGUABLY THE PEOPLE WHO NEED

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:41.211
THIS THE MOST NEED HELP THE MOST.

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:42.413
ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:44.681
TASTES STATE TAXES BECAUSE THEIR

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:45.949
INCOME IS TOO LOW.

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.317
AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE LEFT

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:50.587
ENTIRELY OUT OF THIS.

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.022
THE OTHER THING IS THE COST IS

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.357
PRETTY HIGH IT'S A BILLION

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:54.591
DOLLARS.

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:56.260
AND I JUST WONDER IF THAT WOULD

00:44:56.326 --> 00:44:58.529
BE BETTER SPENT REDUCING TUITION

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:00.130
AT STATE SCHOOLS.

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:04.301
ARE UP SCHOLARSHIPS AT CETERA SO

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:05.836
MY CONCERN IS THAT.

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:08.172
THIS DOES NOT GO THIS MONEY

00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:09.740
WOULD NOT GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:12.142
MOST NEED NAMELY THOSE PEOPLE

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.944
ARE MAKING TOO LITTLE INCOME. TO

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:16.447
PAY TAXES AND THEN.

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:17.848
YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THERE'S A

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:21.819
BETTER USE OF THE MONEY. THIRTY

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:23.821
CHAIR FIVE THERE'S THERE'S NO

00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:25.656
DOUBT THAT THE HIGH PRICE OF OF

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:27.691
OF A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION RIGHT

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:29.927
NOW IS IS PROHIBITING SOME

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.495
PEOPLE TO GO THE QUESTION IS IS

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.230
THIS MANY FOLKS IT'S A DIFFERENT

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:33.831
BATCH OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:34.765
ABOUT.

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:35.899
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING TO

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.401
GO TO SCHOOL OR MOVING FORWARD

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:38.502
IN SCHOOL.

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:39.903
WE WANT TO BRING THAT PRICE DOWN

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.071
THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:43.474
LEGISLATURE THE REALITY IS THAT

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.342
A WHOLE GENERATION OF PEOPLE ARE

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.010
STUCK WITH THE STUDENT DEBT.

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:49.913
THERE'S NO RELIEF FROM THEM EVEN

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.714
IF WE MADE.

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:51.682
UNIVERSITY FREE THEY WOULD STILL

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.884
BE STUCK WITH THEIR SIXTY

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:54.518
SEVENTY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:55.886
SO THIS IS THIS IS DIRECTED AT

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:59.256
THAT CHUNK OF FOLKS WITH THE THE

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:00.691
PRICE TAG OF BILLION DOLLARS.

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:01.959
BUT THE OTHER QUESTION IS.

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:03.494
THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.229
ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE SO

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:06.797
LITTLE OF THEY DON'T PAY TAXES

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:08.232
IMAGINE A SINGLE MOM IS A

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:09.933
TEACHER.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.502
DOES IT MAKE ENOUGH WITH

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:13.237
DEDUCTIONS TO PAY TAXES YOU'RE

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:16.006
NOT GIVING THAT PERSON A A BREAK

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:16.673
AT ALL.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.408
OF THIS GENTLEMAN OVER HERE WHO

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:19.476
IS YET.

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:22.012
I THINK TO GET A PERMANENT JOB.

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.281
HE WOULD GET NO BREAK SELL THE

00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:26.750
PROBLEM IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:28.652
NEED IT THE MOST.

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:29.753
WE GET NO BREAK FROM YOUR BILL

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.821
BECAUSE IT'S AND NON REFUNDABLE

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:34.057
TAX CREDIT.

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:36.193
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT I GUESS

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.794
THE IN IN SHEER NUMBERS THE

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:38.629
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:40.731
STUDENT LOANDEBT ARE PEOPLE I

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.633
HAVE SOME IN COMMAND OF OF TAXES

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:44.201
AT THE PAIN BECAUSE THE THE

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.402
CHALLENGES THAT IF THEY HAVE

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:46.737
PAID ANY.

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:48.105
OF THEIR STIFF THERE THAT.

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:49.873
POR I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.041
THEY'RE PAYING BACK IN THEIR

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:53.477
THEIR THEIR STUDENT LOAN DEBT.

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:54.478
BUT THEY STILL OWE IT IN IF

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:55.712
YOU'D MAKE IT A REFUNDABLE TAX

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:57.214
CREDIT [inaudible]

00:46:57.281 --> 00:47:00.617
AND IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:02.819
TO HELP THAN THOSE FOLKS ON THE

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:11.028

IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU ONLY GOT.

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.470

APRIL OF THIS YEAR -- FIFTY ONE

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:41.311
THOUSAND MY CONCERN IS THIS

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:42.812
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY.

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:45.382
NOW YOU ARE A STATE DEPARTMENT

00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:47.450
TAURUS STATE FUNCTION I THINK

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:48.585
THIS SHOULD COME OUT OF THE

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:49.919
GENERAL FUND.

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:52.389
ARE THEY GIVE US TRAVEL MONEY

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:55.525
AND PER DIEM AND YOU KNOW WE

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:58.061
HAVE STAFF -- I THINK THIS WOULD

00:54:58.128 --> 00:54:59.996
JUST BE A BETTER SOLUTION.

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:01.898
AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO LOOK INTO

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:03.600
THAT NEXT YEAR AS WE LOOK AT THE

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:06.069
BUDGET TRYING MAKE CASE FOR IT.

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:08.138
MY CONCERN HERE IS TWO FOLD ONE

00:55:08.204 --> 00:55:09.239
IS.

00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:10.707
THERE BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF VERY

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:19.082
GOOD -- INSTITUTIONS -- EIGHT

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:21.117
THE LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE

00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:23.219
RESEARCH FIND MUNICIPAL SHELTERS

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:24.821
SPAY NEUTER FOND.

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:26.289
CALIFORNIA BILL POLICE

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:28.191
ACTIVITIES LEAGUE FUND WHICH

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:29.492
HAVE COME OFF.

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:33.129
AND I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS SHOULD

00:55:33.196 --> 00:55:36.266
HAVE A A SPECIAL.

00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:38.668
DISPENSATION WHEN WE DON'T GIVE

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:40.670
IT TO OTHERS -- I DO THINK IT'S

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:43.940
IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE THIS --

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:46.109
BUT I'M I AM REALLY CONCERNED

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.577
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT THIS SETS

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.312
BECAUSE ALL OF THESE GROUPS THAT

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:53.316
COME OFF -- ARE WORTHWHILE

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:55.552
GROUPS FURTHER WE NOW HAVE A

00:55:55.618 --> 00:55:58.788
LINE OF PEOPLE READY TO GO ON

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.356
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE COME OFF.

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:02.225
AND IF WE WERE TO GRANDFATHER IN

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.294
THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THERE NOW --

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.596
IT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR JUST

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:08.064
KEEPING.

00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:09.966
OTHER GROUPS OFF SO THIS IS A

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:11.935
CONCERN I HAVE AND I REALLY DO

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:12.836
THINK.

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:14.137
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE NUMBERS

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:18.007
HAVE GONE DOWN FROM 200-500-0028

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.809
TO WHAT WAS IT.

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:21.010
NINETY YEAH NINETY THOUSAND LAST

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:23.446
YEAR TO FIFTY ONE THOUSAND SO

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:24.514
FAR THIS YEAR.

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:26.216
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:28.485
SOMETHING THAT WE AS A STATE

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:31.020
SHOULD BE FUNDING.

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:32.622
AND THAT'S SAD.

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:33.623
I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE IN THE

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:36.159
LONG RUN THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.727
CONSIDERING THAT THE FUNDS JUST

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:41.397
AREN'T COMING MAN.

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:42.365
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.134

THAT BUT UP.

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:46.770
FIRST THIS YEAR SO HAS BEEN PART

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.404
OF THE ORIGINAL FOUR THERE WERE

ON THE TAX CHECKOFF IN SINCE

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:52.609
THEN.

00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:53.910
THERE'S BEEN TWO HUNDRED CSL

00:56:53.977 --> 00:56:56.780
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED

00:56:56.846 --> 00:56:58.348
AND SIGNED INTO LAW SO.

00:56:58.414 --> 00:56:59.783
THEIR BODY OF WORK IN TERMS OF

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:01.017

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:10.560
THE PART IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:13.229
SOURCES AND HOW IT'S BEEN.

00:57:13.296 --> 00:57:16.032
DIMINISHING OVER THE YEARS --

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:17.233
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.369
JUST A REMINDER.

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:20.136
WE WERE.

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:25.108

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:30.246
THERE'S A THIS IS OUR PERCEPTION

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:31.648
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT.

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:34.017
WE ARE BEING GIVEN FUNDS FOR THE

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:36.352
ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECT OF THE

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:39.489
ORGANIZATION NOT THE ADVOCACY.

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:42.158
PIECE.

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:45.528
OUR SO WHAT MY NEXT.

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:46.830
POINT TWO THERE IS AND THEN WHAT

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:48.531
WE ARE.

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:50.433
POINTING OUT IS THAT WE WERE

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.436
ORIGINALLY ON THE TAX CHECK OFF.

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:56.005
AS ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:57.740
HAVE NO MINIMUM.

00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:01.244
SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THE

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:04.414
OTHER FUNDS WERE ADDED. TO THAT

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:08.484
STATUS WE SOMEHOW LOST.

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:10.453
THAT STATUS IT'S NEVER BEEN ABLE

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.888
TO REGAIN THAT.

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:15.825
THIRD JUST ANOTHER REMINDER --

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:17.894
WE'VE SEEN OUR REVENUE DIMINISH

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:20.730
BY OVER 80% WITH.

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:24.934
NO ONE ABLE. TO CONVEY TO US.

00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:27.103
WHAT WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED AS YU

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.637
KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:29.005
DONORS ARE?

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.139
THAT'S PROTECTED UNDER THE

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:31.608
FRANCHISE TAG ON THE RIGHT TO

00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:34.577
PRIVACY RIGHT AND THAT WE'RE

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:35.778
WE'RE FACED WITH NOW IS.

00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:39.182
ATTEMPTING TO RESURRECT.

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:41.851
THOSE AT DONOR BASE AND WHAT HAS

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:43.620
HAPPENED IS EACH TIME.

00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:46.389
WE ARE NOT STATED WE LOSE A

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.091
POSITION WE WERE NUMBER TWO OR

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:50.360
NUMBER THREE ON THE TAX CHECK

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:52.629
OFF FOR YEARS.

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:54.163
HOW ACCORDING TO SENATOR MORLOCK

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.599
THIS PRESENTATION WITH REGARD TO

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:59.202
SB?

00:58:59.269 --> 00:58:59.836
TWO FORTY ONE WE'RE ONLY DEALING

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.237
WITH A FINITE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:02.572
ANYWAY.

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:04.941
THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE TAX CHECK

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:06.409
OFF IF HE'S RIGHT.

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:07.510
OUR AND SO.

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:10.313
OUR CONCERN IS THAT WHEN WE LOSE.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.082
SKEWS ME IF WE LOSE OUR POSITION.

00:59:13.149 --> 00:59:14.117
THEN WE START OVER AGAIN IN

00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:16.286
TERMS OF OUR MARKETING.

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:18.154
BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER NUMBER

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:20.056
TWO OR THREE WERE NOW TWENTY

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:21.591
SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT OR

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:23.426
WHATEVER THE POSITION WILL BE

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:25.795
AND SO THE MARKETING AGAIN SLIPS.

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:28.431
AND YOUR RECOGNITION FACTOR IS

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:29.832

THE GENERAL FUND I THINK IT

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:01.323
NOT JUST ONE THING I WISH IT WAS

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:02.558
OR WE COULD DO THAT BUT THIS

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:03.826
THIS CERTAINLY IS GOING TO HELP

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.861
THEIR A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.363
WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BUY A HOME

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:08.497
UNDER A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.765
WHO CAN'T AFFORD HOME RIGHT NOW

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:10.933
BUT REGARDLESS WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.635
RENTERS OUT THERE?

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.169
AND WE REALLY DO NEED TO BRING

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:16.071
THESE IDEAS FORWARD AND TRY TO

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.973
HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THE

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.509
RESIDENTS AT THE RAN -- AND HELP

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:21.710
THEM PERHAPS WORK TOWARD HOME

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.545
HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT THIS IS THE

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:25.314
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SEEMS TO BE

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:27.049
LEFT OUT A LOT ARE THE RUNNERS

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.751
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.285
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:33.722
AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY WIDE

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:37.126
SUPPORT.

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:39.261
SHIP DOCTOR QUIRK.

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:41.363
SO MY CONCERN HERE IS JUST THE

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.797
LAWS OF ECONOMICS.

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.732
SO YOU HAVE A DEMAND CURVE IN

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:46.869
SUPPLY CURVE.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:50.072
MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS INCREASE.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:50.973
IN.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.208
MONEY AVAILABLE TO RANCHERS WILL

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:55.444
SIMPLY RESULT IF THERE IS NOT

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:58.013
ENOUGH SUPPLY OF RENTAL HOUSING

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.582
WHICH THERE ISN'T [inaudible]

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.217
THAT BASICALLY.

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:04.787
I MEAN I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.155
READ THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:07.322
HOUSING.

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:09.324
ARE GOING TO SAY WELL NOW WE CAN

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.759
CHARGE MORE.

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:12.461
AND THE PEOPLE HAVE A LITTLE BIT

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:13.796
MORE MONEY AND YOU CAN CHARGE A

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:14.997
LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:17.166
SO MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS WOULD

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.667
ALL BE TAKEN UP.

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.335
IN THE FACT BY THE PEOPLE WHO

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:22.604
ARE ALREADY TAKING IN THE RANTS.

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:24.807
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:26.341
THE OTHER IS THAT IT'S SIX

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:27.910
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:30.112
AND ARE THERE BETTER WAYS TO

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.513
HELP OUT RANCHERS.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.215
YOU ALSO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:34.950
ALL THE MONEY THAT IS SPENT ON

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.118
HOMEOWNERS.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:41.957
I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF ACTUALLY --

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.592
OVER TIME WE ARE THE ONLY

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.427
DEVELOPED COUNTRY.

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.362
THAT ALLOWS HOMEOWNERS THOSE TAX

01:12:47.429 --> 01:12:50.299
BREAKS IN BRITAIN DAVE -- TAKEN

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:52.367
THEM OUT.

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:54.803
ARE THEY DID IT OVER A PERIOD OF

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.338
YEARS SO PEOPLE AT TIME TO

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:57.406
ADJUST.

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:58.674
I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:01.076
EXTREMELY FAIR THING TO DO I

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:02.711
DON'T EXPECT THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:05.481
PASS ANYTIME SOON -- BUT I DO

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:08.884
AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS A BIG --

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:11.053
DISCREPANCY HERE BETWEEN HELPING

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.488
THE MORE WEALTHY FOLKS.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.389
BUT THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.991
ABOUT.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:17.960
THE PRICE OF THESE HOMES FOR

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:20.062
EXAMPLE MY SON IS LOOKING AT A

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:22.097
HOME IN REDWOOD CITY.

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:23.699
ARCHERY HALFWAY BETWEEN SAN

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.267
FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE WHERE HE

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.903
AND HIS WIFE TO BE LIVE.

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.271
THE STAR HOME IS A MILLION AND A

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:30.672
HALF.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:31.974
I'M WILLING TO BET THAT IF WE

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.244
DIDN'T ALLOW TAX DEDUCTIONS ON

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.212
THAT THE PRICES WOULD GO DOWN SO

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:38.580
WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THAT I'M

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:40.983
WORRIED THAT ALL OF THE SLACK.

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:42.050
WHICH SIMPLY ALL OF THIS

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:43.619
ADDITIONAL MONEY WOULD BE TAKEN

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:44.753
OUT BY THE PEOPLE AROUND THE

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:49.892
HOUSING.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:52.261
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER.

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:52.895
HAPPY TO HAVE CHAIRS PERMISSION

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.563
OF COURSE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:56.098
YOUR ANALYSIS ABOUT SUPPLY AND

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.900
DEMAND IT'S REALLY THE BIG IT'S

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:59.201
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM AND

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.335
WE'RE CERTAINLY WORKING AT A

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:01.570
FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:03.238
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND HAVE

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:04.673
FOR FOR A COUPLE YEARS.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.141
BUT IT'S SLOW TO HAVE ITS EFFECT

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.409
BUT LISTEN IF YOU'RE A RENTER IN

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:11.213
YOUR PAIN 506070%.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.181
OF YOUR INCOME ON RENT.

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:14.149
AND A BILL LIKE THIS COMES ALONG

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:15.784
WITH ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP TO GET

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:16.418
INSTEAD OF HAVING A SIXTY DOLLAR

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:17.853
CREDIT.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.721
BUT TO GO UP TO FOURTEEN THIRTY

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:20.422
FOUR THAT THAT'S GONNA BE THAT'S

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:22.191
GONNA BE A BIG HELP TO YOU AND

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:23.525
IS IT GOING TO CHANGE THE THE

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:26.161
PROFIT CURVE FOR A A LANDLORD.

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:27.763
LOOK EVERYONE AND IS GOING TO

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:28.764
MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES IN THE

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.232
MARKET PLACE FOR THAT YOU KNOW

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.600
WE CAN'T CONTROL THAT.

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.501
BUT I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:33.836
HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IN

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:35.270
UNDER THIS BILL YOU'RE GONNA

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:36.405
HELP TWO POINT FOUR MILLION.

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.273
I THE LOWEST END OF THE ECONOMIC

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.542
SCALE WHO ARE SUFFERING THE MOST

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.411
SO DO WE NEED TO BUILD MORE --

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:43.912
OF HOUSING OF COURSE.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.881
BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING AND

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:46.548
FORTY YEARS TO HELP THOSE IN THE

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:48.283
LOWEST AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:49.751
THAT SINGLE MOMS AND DADS THIS

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.253
BILL WOULD PROVIDE THAT REFORM

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.688
IN THE LAW.

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:55.424
IT'S NOT THERE TODAY AT THE

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:58.227
COULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

01:14:58.293 --> 01:14:59.194
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.462
OF THE COMMITTEE.

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:01.396
SEEING THEM WOULD YOU LIKE TO

CONSIDERATION I KNOW IT'S NOT A

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.267
DECISION POINT TODAY.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.568
AND I ALSO WOULD JUST RECOGNIZE

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:07.569
AGAIN THAT.

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:08.637
THESE THINGS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:11.039
BUDGET WE NOW WE HAVE LOTS OF
