00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:52.797
DECISION TO DO SO IS REALLY

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:54.765
LEFT UP TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:56.267

LIKELY DO TAKE SOME TIME.

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:16.787
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. SO

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:17.988
THE STATE NOT COAL DATA. ON

THEY'RE PERMITTED TO BE OPEN

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.482

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.181
SEE THAT. WHEN CULPRITS ARE IN

00:41:57.248 --> 00:42:00.251
PLACE- THE GUIDANCE ALLOWS FOR

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:02.052
SCHOOLS TO RELAX THE SIX FEET

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.854
RECOMMENDATION AND ALLOWS

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.089
ESPECIALLY IF IT ALLOWS MORE

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:07.191
STUDENTS- TO BENEFIT FROM IN

00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:08.659
PERSON INSTRUCTION. SO THIS

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.227
GUIDANCE PRIORITIZES FACE

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:11.929
COVERINGS AND STABLE COHORTS

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:14.431
OVER PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AS

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:15.733
ANOTHER EXAMPLE GUIDANCE WE

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:17.201
ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME FOR

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:18.435
INSTANCE IN THE JULY

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:19.770
SEVENTEENTH DEPARTMENT OF

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:20.905
PUBLIC HEALTH LETTER ON SCHOOL

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:22.239
REOPENING. THE COUNT THE

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:23.374
DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDED

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.175
PERIODICALLY TESTING DISTRICT

00:42:25.242 --> 00:42:26.911
AND SCHOOL STAFF. BUT IN AN

00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:28.279
UPDATED GUIDANCE RELEASED ON

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:30.047
AUGUST THIRD THE DEPARTMENT

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.081
SAID THE ROLE OF ROUTINE

00:42:31.148 --> 00:42:32.983
TESTING FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.618
IT'S CURRENTLY UNCLEAR. I THINK

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:35.686
THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF HOW

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:36.787
CHALLENGING IT CAN BE FOR

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:37.821
SCHOOLS TO NAVIGATE VARIOUS

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.089
GUIDANCE FROM VARIOUS DIFFERENT

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:40.925
ENTITIES. AND HOW TO MAKE SENSE

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:42.459
OF HOW ALL OF THIS APPLY TO

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:44.061
THEM EXPRESSIONISTIC THE

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:46.096
GUIDANCE IS NOT CONSISTENT- SO

00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:47.431
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:48.799
EXECUTIVE ORDERS REQUIRES

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.267
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO COMPLY WITH

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:51.702
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:52.770
AND- LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:58.208
GUIDANCE. HOW SCHOOLS. REOPEN

00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.310
AN INTERPRETER EMBLEM IT'S THE

00:42:59.376 --> 00:42:59.977
GUIDANCE IS LARGELY LEFT UP TO

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:01.512
DISTRICT. WOULD BE AND THE NEXT

00:43:01.578 --> 00:43:03.981
PAGE. SO OFF OF A REVIEW OF THE

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:05.616
LATEST RESEARCH THERE ARE STILL

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:07.184
MANY UNKNOWNS AND THE GUIDANCE

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.486
OF BERRIES IT REMAINS UNCLEAR

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:10.754
THE BEST PART WHAT THE BEST

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:12.890
PRACTICES ARE AND HOW STATES

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:14.358
CAN BEST SUPPORT SCHOOLS

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:15.960
REOPENING EVEN WHEN SCHOOLS ARE

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:17.728
ALLOWED TO REOPEN THIS IS

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:19.463
LARGELY DUE TO THE SHORT TIME

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.698
FRAME AND LIMITED EVIDENCE WE

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:21.765
HAVE FOR SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:23.600
OPENINGS IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.135
HOWEVER AND THERE ARE SOME

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:26.203
ACTIONS THAT THE STATE CAN

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.972
CONSIDER TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.573
LARGELY THIS IS GEARED TOWARDS

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.308
THE STATE STEPPING IN TO FILL

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.477
IN ANY POTENTIAL GAPS FIRST

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.245
MISTAKE PROVIDE MORE TAILORED

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.482
I'M RE OPENING PLANS AND

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:40.217
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PLANS

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:42.052
THIS INCLUDES ON SITE- VIRTUAL

PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. AND

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:48.559
PERHAPS THIS CAN HELP BUILD

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:50.127
CONFIDENCE OF TEACHERS. IT'S

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:51.161
AND STAFF THAT THE SCHOOLS

00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:53.330
CANNOT REOPEN SAFELY THAT

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:56.600
PROPER PRECAUTIONS AND MEASURES

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:57.968

COBIT NINETEEN CASES CALIFORNIA

00:44:08.712 --> 00:44:10.147
IS ONE OF ELEVEN STATES THAT DO

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:11.648
NOT REPORT ANY SCHOOL LEVEL

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.117

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.651
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO

OTHER RESPONSE MATTERS. LASTLY

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:29.833
THE STATE COULD PROVIDE CLEAR

GUIDANCE ON KOBE NINETEEN

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:33.070

FOR OTHER SCHOOLS IN OTHER

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.191
AREAS OF THE STATE MAY BE MORE

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:55.659
CHALLENGING TO FIND ACCESS TO

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:56.894
ROUTINE TESTING AND THE SORT OF

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.562
SUPPORT. THE STATE COULD ALSO

TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS HIGH

00:45:57.287 --> 00:45:58.722
LEVEL. THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:00.124
MINDFUL THAT SCHOOLS NEED CLEAR

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.725
GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES FROM THE

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.560
STATE TO HELP THEM RE OPEN.

00:46:03.627 --> 00:46:04.495
THESE MUST BE PARTNERED WITH A

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.096
BALANCED MIX OF PROGRAMMATIC

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:07.397

ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURE THAT

OUR STUDENTS ARE BEING SERVED

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:14.371
ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE

STUDENTS. AS WE NOTED THE STATE

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:18.408
HAS ALREADY GONE A LONG WAY TO

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:19.443
MEETING THE NEEDS OF SCHOOLS TO

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:20.777
REOPEN SAFELY AND THIS IS

00:46:20.844 --> 00:46:22.679
EVIDENCED BY THE MANY THAT

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:24.681
ALREADY HAVE RE OPENED. HOWEVER

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:25.315
YOU RECOGNIZE THAT IN A

00:46:25.382 --> 00:46:27.084
CONSTANTLY EVOLVING SITUATION

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.552
SUCH AS THE ONE THAT WE'RE IN.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:29.720
THERE'S ALWAYS MORE TO DO AND

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:31.555
WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MEET

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:32.089
THE NEW CHALLENGES AS THEY

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:34.758
ARISE. TO DATE WE HAVE PROVIDED

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:35.959
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES FOR K.

HARMLESS AND APPORTIONMENT

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:50.240
DEFERRALS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.009
SIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE

TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.111

ADDRESS BARRIERS TO LEARNING.

00:47:10.527 --> 00:47:11.762
THESE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED WITH

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.497
EQUITY IN MND AS WE KNOW THAT

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:14.765

INCOME FAMILIES THE MOST. AND

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.236
I'LL STOP HERE FOR A MOMENT

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:20.904
JUST TO MENTION THAT- IN OUR

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.005
CONVERSATIONS WITHIN THE

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:26.310
FOCUS FOR US HAS REALLY BEEN ON

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:27.778
EQUITY AND THAT IS WHY IT WAS

00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:29.546
SO IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNOR.

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:30.547
THAT IS FIVE POINT THREE

SAFE RETURN TO CLASSROOM BASED

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:51.661

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.129
TAKE TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:55.632
MONUMENTAL JOB OUR TEACHERS AND

EDUCATIONAL LEADERS HAVE DONE

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:58.468
IN THE FALL TO STRENGTHEN

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:06.409
PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED AND

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:07.944
EXACERBATED INEQUITIES

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:09.779
THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY WE ALL

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.050
RECONNECT WITH OUR MOST

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:15.719
INTERNAL BOTH STUDENTS ALREADY

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.454
ON THE MARGINS. THIS IS

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.688
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FROM

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:20.590
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL PERSPECTIVE I

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.392
THIS PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED AND

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:24.694
INTENSIFIED THE TRAUMA TOO MANY

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:29.099
OF OUR STUDENTS. I KNOW HOW

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:30.767
MUCH OUR EDUCATORS WANT AND

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:32.135
NEED TO BE BACK AT SCHOOL WHEN

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:37.574
SO. THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:39.042
HAS BEEN CLEAR FROM THE

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.276
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THAT

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:41.277
WE CAN ONLY DEVELOP A

SUCCESSFUL PATHWAY TO RETURN TO

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.618
FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS IS AN

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:49.753
EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX

00:54:49.819 --> 00:54:51.588
UNDERTAKING THAT REQUIRES

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:52.856

INTERNET APPROACH. TO MAINTAIN

BRIEFLY BEFORE. WE HAVE FOUR

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.655
DIFFERENT TIERS RATHER THAN

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.091
JUST AN ON OFF. AND THOSE TEARS

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.359
HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:05.862
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION. WE USE

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:11.034

POSITIVITY. AS WAYS OF LOOKING

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.438
WHETHER THERE'S WIDESPREAD

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.506

TRANSMISSION IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:19.409
THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:21.010
PRINCIPLE WE WANTED TO

QUICKLY SO- ANY OF THE THINGS

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:43.185
WOULD REQUIRE TIME AND EFFORT

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.538
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.574
IN VARIOUS STAGES OF RE OPENING

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.875
AND I AND WE DID OF COURSE AS

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:41.243
YOU KNOW IT PUT THE SIGNIFICANT

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.045
AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE CURRENT

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:45.848
YEAR BUDGET. FOR IN THE ONE

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:48.383

WITH THESE DISTANCE LEARNING

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:51.420
NEEDS AND AS WELL AS POTENTIAL

01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:53.088
RE OPENING. YOU KNOW DO YOU

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.890
THINK THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED.

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.892
AND POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW IF WE

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.393
HAVE A CHANCE DO YOU THINK THAT

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.562
WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT. DOING

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:02.598
SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE- IN THE

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:04.299
BUDGET YEAR THE CURRENT YEAR

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:04.967

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:07.836
CURRENT YEAR. TO HELP DISTRICTS

OUT THERE TODAY. SO THIS JUST%

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:14.309
COMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:17.779
YOU ASK A QUESTION THAT- IS IT

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.414
I THINK THE ANSWER IS

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.016
CONSTANTLY EVOLVING AS WE AS

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:22.718
THE PANDEMIC PROGRESSES AND WE

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:24.653
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NEEDS OUT

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.221
AND IN THE FIELD. I WOULD SAY

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.390
THAT OUR BEST DATA POINT FOR

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.058
THE FISCAL NEEDS OF SCHOOL

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.961
DISTRICTS- IS THE DATA THAT

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.263
WE'RE COLLECTING CURRENTLY ON

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:35.731
THE EXPENDITURE OF THE FIVE

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:38.533
POINT THREE BILLION- FUNDS THAT

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.769
WENT OUT- AND THAT'S A MIXTURE

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:42.838
OF FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS-

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.173
SOME GENERAL FUND. THE MAJORITY

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.541
OF THAT FUNDING IS FEDERAL

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.343
CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUN ABOUT

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:50.479
FOUR POINT BILLION OF IT. AND

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:51.647
THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED BY

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.382
DECEMBER THIRTIETH THIS YEAR

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:55.150
THAT'S PURSUANT TO FEDERAL

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.084
REQUIREMENTS AND SO THE STATE

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:57.819
HAS BEEN. TRACKING VERY

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.321
CAREFULLY THE EXPENDITURE OF

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.423
THAT FUNDS BY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.258
AGENCIES AND AT THIS POINT.

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:06.929
STATEWIDE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.530
TRACK A LITTLE BIT LESS OR

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:10.299
APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THOSE

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:12.467
FUNDS BEING EXPENDED. CERTAINLY

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.769
WE HAVE TWO MORE MONTHS LEFT TO

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:15.470
THE DECEMBER THIRTIETH DEADLINE

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:18.240
BUT- IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.309
THAT MONEY HAS RUN SHORT YET.

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.877
SO WE'RE CURRENTLY TRACKING

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:23.812
THAT RESOURCE WISE IT FISCALLY

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.314
RESOURCE WISE WE BELIEVE THAT

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:28.116
SCHOOLS HAVE- WHAT THEY NEED ON

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:30.585
A MACRO LEVEL. AGAIN IT'S HARD

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.621
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AS THE

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:34.356
SITUATION CONTINUES TO CHANGE

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.358
WE LEARN. NEW INFORMATION EVERY

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.160

DISTRICTS VERY CAREFULLY I

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:42.564
THINK. I'M IN OUR CONVERSATIONS

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.333
WITH CBO'S GOOD CHIEF BUSINESS

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:47.369
pI'VE HEARD LESS OF A CONCERN

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:48.737
ABOUT THE CURRENT YEAR FUNDING

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:49.905
IN MORE OF A CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.373
ON GOING FUNDING GIVEN TO CHECK

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.241
POTENTIAL LONG TERM CHANGES IN

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:57.112
ENROLLMENT- SO THAT'S REALLY

01:16:57.179 --> 01:16:58.380
WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING. YEAH

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.015

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.316
FOR ME IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:02.884

THIS AROUND MY AREA HERE IN THE

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.259
REGION IN SACRAMENTO THE

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:15.884
DO THIS IN A PHASE WAY AND A

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:17.552
GRADUAL RE OPENING SO IT MAKES

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:18.887
SENSE TO DO HYBRID IN THE

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:20.489
BEGINNING WORK. SOME SCHOOL

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:21.289
DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS ARE

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:22.491
FACING IN THEIR YOUNGEST

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:23.892
CHILDREN FIRST AND THAT WAS

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.427
SORT OF THE IDEA BEHIND THE

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:26.528
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LABOR AS

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:29.131
WELL. WE WENT WE KNOW BOTH THAT

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:32.000
THE YOUNGER CHILDREN. ARE THE

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:33.101
LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE A SERIOUS

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:34.669
INFECTION LEAST LIKELY TO CARRY

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:37.239
INFECTION- SO THOSE ARE AND

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.407
ALSO OF COURSE THE MOST- OFTEN

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.108
THE MOST DIFFICULT TO HAVE

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:42.077
DISTANCE LEARNING- AND AS I

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.745
MENTIONED YOU KNOW ALL COOKIES

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:45.614
IS A REPORTABLE- WE ARE

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.816
TRACKING AND- YOU KNOW ANY

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:48.583
SCHOOL OUTBREAKS HAVE BEEN

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.485
REPORTED TO US IN ONLY TWO TO

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:51.887
DATE HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO US

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:52.988
AT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:53.989
FROM OUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:55.524
COLLEAGUES. I'M AND CAN ONLY A

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:56.858
TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN CASES SO

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:57.626
THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING

01:19:57.692 --> 01:20:01.730
CONSIDERING THE. NUMBER OF

01:20:01.796 --> 01:20:02.264
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ALREADY

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.898
STARTED TO RE OPEN. AND THEN AS

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:03.698
FAR AS- WE HAPPENS WHEN THERE

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:04.432
IS BECAUSE INEVITABLY THERE

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:06.768
WILL BE. SOME KIDS OR TEACHERS

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:09.070
TESTING POSITIVE DO WE HAVE ANY

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:11.573
ANY GUIDELINES. AS AS AN

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.475
EXAMPLE HERE IN ELK GROVE AND

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.743
LOCALLY THIS IS THE FIRST

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:15.644
DISTRICT I SHUT DOWN IN

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.012
CALIFORNIA IT'S A MASSIVE

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:19.147
DISTRICTS PROBABLY FIFTEEN

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:20.348
TWENTY MILES WIDE. LITERALLY

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:21.917
THERE WERE TWO HIGH SCHOOL KIDS

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.785
ON THE FARM OF THE DISTRICT

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:25.987
THEY WERE FIFTEEN MILES AWAY

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:28.323
FROM. MAJORITY OTHER SCHOOLS

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.258
WHO TESTED POSITIVE IN ENTIRE

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:31.927
DISTRICT SHUT DOWN GRANTED THIS

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:33.562
WAS EARLY MARCH WE DIDN'T KNOW.

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:34.596
THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT WAS

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:37.199
HAPPENING WITH THIS ISSUE SO I

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:38.200
THINK YOU KNOW WOULD WE LEARN

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:41.403
AS FAR AS HOW THIS GOES SO.

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:41.970
WHAT TYPE OF ADVICE ARE WE

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:44.005
GIVING AS FAR AS- WHAT THE

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:46.508
POLICIES WOULD BE FOR SCHOOLS

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:47.776
AND CLASSROOMS AND HOW IT WOULD

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:51.479
IMPACT. THE ACTUAL SCHOOL SIRE

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:52.714
THE DIFFERENT DECENT SCHOOLS.

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.549
SURE AGAIN CURRENTLY THE

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:55.917
GUIDANCE- FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:58.220
CASE IS TO OF COURSE NOTIFY.

01:20:58.286 --> 01:20:59.321
THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:00.188
WORK THE LOCAL HEALTH

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:01.189
DEPARTMENT AND DO CONTACT

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:03.091
TRACING. AND DETERMINE WHO IS

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:03.959
ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY BEEN

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:05.327
EXPOSED DURING THE CASES

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:06.962
INFECTIOUS PERIOD. SO THAT VERY

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:07.996
WELL MAY INCLUDE AN ENTIRE

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.464
COHORT AND THIS IS WHY THE

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:10.699
PRINCIPLES ABOUT NOT MIXING

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:12.400
COLORS AND HAVING STABLE CARDS

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.169
ARE VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU KNOW

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:15.036
EXACTLY WHO THE STAFF OR

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:16.838
STUDENT HAS HAD CONTACT WITH

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:17.973
AND THE TWO DAYS PRIOR TO

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.641
INFECTION AS IN THE LAST. DAYS

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.409
PRIOR TO BEING ON THE SCHOOL

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:23.345
CAMPUS. THEN YOU CAN-

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:24.546
QUARANTINE THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.114
YOU CAN TEST THEM FIRST AND

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:26.982
ESPECIALLY ANYBODY IS

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.149
SYMPTOMATIC AND THEN QUARANTINE

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:29.951
ANYBODY HAS BEEN EXPOSED. AND

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:32.220
THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO EXCLUDE

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:33.121
ANYONE ELSE FROM THE SCHOOL

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:34.956
CAMPUS AND NOT MONITOR VERY

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:37.125
CLOSELY. AND AGAIN OUR- OF

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.660
CURRENT GUIDANCE SAYS THAT YOU

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:39.761
KNOW YOU YOU WOULDN'T REALLY

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:42.497
CONSIDER CLOSING AN ENTIRE

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:44.099
SCHOOL. UNTIL YOU HAD MULTIPLE

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:46.568
CASES AND PROBE. OR MORE THAN

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.837
5% OF THE SCHOOL POPULATION SO

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:50.105
YOU KNOW REALLY THAT WOULD BE A

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:52.007
MORE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:54.676
AGAIN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN BOTH-

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:57.045
IN THE STATE AND OTHER YOU KNOW

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:58.647
OTHER SITUATIONS AS SOMETIMES

01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:00.048
YOU'LL SEE. YOU KNOW WHEN THERE

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:01.483
IS COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION ON

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:02.517
THE HIGHER LEVELS OF CAN

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.052
HENDERSON YOU'RE GONNA SEE.

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:05.587
THAT THE TIMES REFLECTED AND

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:06.888
STUFF OR STUDENTS BUT IF YOU

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.523
QUICKLY ISOLATE THEM YOU'D HAVE

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:09.457
TO CONTACT QUARANTINE THE

01:22:09.524 --> 01:22:11.960
CONTACT YOU CAN. ABSOLUTELY

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.295
PREVENT FURTHER INFECTIONS.

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:14.162
THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:15.563
HELPFUL AND OF COURSE THE YOU

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:16.364
KNOW THE RIGHT COURSE OF

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:19.367
ACTION- NOW WE'LL GET TO OTHER

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:24.472
MEMBERS ARE START WITH ASSEMBLY.

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:28.109
MEMBER CONSULT. FROM LOOKING.

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:28.943
AT WHAT WE WILL NEED I HAVE A

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:29.778
BIT OF A HERE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:31.346
GOT NUMBER TO BEGIN OF HOW MANY

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:32.981
COUNTIES COULD CHILDREN LIVED

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:33.948
AND HOW MANY COUNTIES THAT

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:35.884
COULD REOPEN WE HAVE NO IDEA

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.752
HOW MANY SCHOOLS IN THE STATE

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:42.757
ARE OPEN DAILY. OR SCHOOL

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:43.591
DISTRICTS DOES ANYBODY HAVE

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:45.527
THAT DATA. LIKE RIGHT NOW SO%

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:47.595
WHAT WE'RE SAYING. THERE BEEN

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.597
SEVENTEEN OPERATE. OUT OF. DO

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.466
WE KNOW HOW MANY SCHOOLS SCHOOL

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:56.471
DISTRICTS. I WILL START AND

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:57.872
THEN I DON'T OVER CD COLORS MAY

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:59.074
WANNA SAY MORE I KNOW THERE'S

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.175
BEEN SOM SURVEYS THAT HAVE

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:01.943
BEEN DONE- AND RECENT SURVEYS I

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:03.845
DID MENTION THAT OVER ELEVEN

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:05.313
HUNDRED AND SIXTY WAIVERS HAVE

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.614
BEEN GRANTED FOR ELEMENTARY

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:07.816
SCHOOLS YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:09.884
SCHOOLS. OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:11.586
OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN. GRANTED

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.921
WAIVERS ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:14.222
THEN AS YOU'RE MENTIONING I

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:15.623
THINK THERE ARE OTHER SCHOOL

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.926
DISTRICTS IN THE RED OR LOWER

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:19.060
TIERS THAT HAVE BEGIN TO RE

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:20.895
OPEN AS WELL AND THERE IS SOME

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:21.696
DATA FROM A RECENT SURVEY THAT

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:23.998
I BELIEVE- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:25.333
HERE MAY HAVE INFORMATION

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.768
ABOUT. WHAT THE SCHOOLS

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:27.769
THEMSELVES OR THE SCHOOL

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.305
DISTRICTS NO NOBODY'S MANDATED

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.073
TO REPORT A CHARTER SCHOOL A

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.508
PRIVATE SCHOOL SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:35.176
THAT'S OPENING THERE'S NO.

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.979
REQUIREMENT TO WE CAN DO A

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:41.916
SURVEY. BUT WE DON'T REALLY

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:45.520
KNOW CORRECT. HEY GREG SENT

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:46.020
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:48.790
EDUCATION. AS WE THERE IS NO

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.792
REQUIREMENT TO QUEUE FOR

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.394
DISTRICTS CAN NOTIFY THEIR

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.397
OPENING PLANS. TO THE STATE. WE

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:58.533
DO HOWEVER KNOW WITH OUR TOP

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.067
TWENTY FIVE DISTRICT THAT

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:00.502
REPRESENT DISTRICTS THAT

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:01.403
REPRESENTS ONE POINT EIGHT

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:03.438
MILLION. OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:04.372
ALMOST ONE THIRD OF STUDENTS IN

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:06.508
CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THEM ARE

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:09.411
NOT OPENING UNTIL JANUARY THERE

01:24:09.477 --> 01:24:11.846
ARE A FEW THAT ARE A FEW THAT

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.415
ARE DOING A PHASED IN. THE

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:14.916
OPENING STARTING IN OCTOBER

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:16.851
DEPENDING ON THEIR COUNTY THAT

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:19.120
THEY'RE IN. AND SO THEY WILL BE

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:21.055
FREEZING IN FROM ELEMENTARY TO

01:24:21.122 --> 01:24:23.091
HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN BY JANUARY

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:24.325
ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS WILL BE

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:26.127
BACK IN CLASSROOM BASED

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.463
INSTRUCTION. WE DO HAVE KNOW

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.031
THAT SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE OUR

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:32.000
LARGER ONE DALY UNIFIED CANDY

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:34.469
AGAIN UNIFIED. AND FRESNO ARE

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.137
DOING SMALL COHORT FOR THEIR

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:38.740
OPENING AT CURRENTLY. AS THEY

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:42.911
LOOK TO DO. IT BASED IN RE

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:46.381
OPENING. OKAY I KNOW WE PASS

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:47.415
BUT MY COLLEAGUE HAD A BILL

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:49.184
ACTUALLY THAT WE PASS BUT GOT

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:50.185
HELD UP THAT WOULD HAVE

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:51.486
ACTUALLY REQUIRED SCHOOLS TO

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:53.955
REPORT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:54.956
REOPEN BECAUSE I THINK WHEN

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:55.824
WE'RE WORKING WITH A NUMBER

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:57.358
LIKE SEVENTEEN WELL THAT SOUNDS

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.626
GREAT BUT WE DON'T KNOW

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:00.929
SEVENTEEN OUT OF HOW MANY- IT

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:03.932
IT'S- DATA BECOMES USELESS IF

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.533
WE CAN'TPUT AN END TO SOME

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.735
COMPARISON- MY OTHER QUESTION

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:10.104
IS WHERE IS THIS DATA ON SCHOOL

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:12.974
REPORTS OF- CASES LIKE WHERE

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:15.276
CAN WE FIND IT. OR IS THIS JUST

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:16.344
WHAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT AT THE

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.146
STATE LEVEL THE COUNTIES THAT

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:20.515
HAVE REPORTED OUTBREAKS AT

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:27.188
SCHOOL HOW DO WE KNOW. THE

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:28.690
CURRENTLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:29.691
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THIS IS

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:31.359
WITHIN OUR SURVEILLANCE DATA WE

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:34.362
WILL BE LOOKING AT- HOW WE CAN.

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:35.363
WORK WITH A LOCAL HEALTH

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:36.498
DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE MORE

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:37.232
INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.034
THIS OKAY SO IT'S NOT THIS IS

WITH ONE ANOTHER. DO WE HAVE

01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:57.118
THAT IN ITS GUIDANCE RIGHT

01:25:57.185 --> 01:26:00.488
BECAUSE NOBODY IS ACTUALLY-

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:01.022

SUPPOSED TO BE THIS IS THAT A

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:09.230

GUIDANCE MAYBE IT'S NOT

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.606
PRACTICAL I THINK THAT WAS THE

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.041
WORD THAT WAS BEING THROWN

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:21.943

THE CD AND THE CALIFORNIA

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:30.485
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

KIND OF LAID IT OUT SO I DON'T

01:26:44.098 --> 01:26:46.234
KNOW IF THEY ARE ARE SUGGESTING

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:49.237
THAT THERE WERE THINGS CONFLICT

01:26:49.304 --> 01:26:51.205
WE'RE NOT SURE. WHAT THE WHAT

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:51.806
WHAT THE SCHOOLS ARE SUPPOSED

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:55.677
TO BE DOING. SO BEFORE YOU

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:57.078
ANSWER THAT EXHIBIT TECHNICAL

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.246
THING SO IF ANYBODY WANTS TO

01:26:58.313 --> 01:26:59.581
ANSWER DO WE NEED TO TELL YOU

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:01.950
WHO ARE LOOKING FOR OR CAN

01:27:02.016 --> 01:27:07.956
ANYBODY JUMP IN AND TALK. SO.

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:09.324
IT IS VERY BROAD I BELIEVE ANY

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:11.559
OF US CAN JUMP IN AND TALK I

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:12.827
THINK I THINK WELL JUST MAKING

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:13.895
SURE WE KNOW WITH THE

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:17.465
APPROPRIATE PERSON I THINK ON

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:18.066
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I WOULD.

01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:19.734
I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE THERE

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:22.403
ARE SOME ASPECTS OF THE CDPH

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:23.204
GUIDANCE THAT IS REQUIRED I

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.272
BELIEVE LIKE THE MASK.

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:25.673
REQUIREMENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.909
IS. AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT FOR

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:28.910
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THERE MIGHT

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:29.777
BE ANOTHER THAT I CAN'T

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:31.312
REMEMBER BUT THE VAST MAJORITY

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:32.947
OF THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW YOU

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.882
IMPLEMENT. THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:36.117
NOT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:37.986
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THIS IS. IT

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:38.920
THESE ARE THINGS GOING TO

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:40.221
CONSIDER TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT TO

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:41.789
THE DEGREE POSSIBLE TO DOESN'T

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:42.757
MEAN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:44.726
IT. THAT'S THAT'S WHERE MOST OF

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.794
THE MAJOR DECISIONS ARE ASIDE

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:49.230
FROM THE MATHIS YOU. GREAT AND

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:49.831
THEN MY FINAL QUESTION FOR NOW

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:50.632
I DON'T THINK YOU AND I THINK

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:52.567
THIS IS FOR DOCTOR PAN BECAUSE

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:54.002
THE- DISCUSSION ABOUT COHORTS

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:55.770
WAS REALLY. EXCITING AND

01:27:55.837 --> 01:27:59.474
INTERESTING. ALTHOUGH I KNOW

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.843
IT'S JUST A VERY RECENT

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:03.845
OUTBREAK- IF IT'S TO UNIFIED

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:08.750
IT'S CLEAR THAT THE- OLDER KIDS

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.018
THEY SUPPOSED TO BE REQUIRED TO

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:12.286
BE IN COHORTS BECAUSE I KNOW-

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:13.688
WITH SO FAR THAT THEY'VE HAD I

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:16.190
THINK FOUR. POSITIVE TESTS IN

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:17.859
THE LAST WEEK TWO OF THEM HAVE

01:28:17.925 --> 01:28:20.628
REQUIRED THEM TO- CORTINA

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:23.464
HUNDRED FIFTY KIDS SO CLEARLY-

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:24.632
THIS IDEA OF A SEVENTEEN

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:27.035
PERCENT. CORE HORROR ARE

01:28:27.101 --> 01:28:28.369
FIFTEEN FOURTEEN TWO. TEACHERS

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:30.238
IS THAT JUST FOR THE WAIVERS

01:28:30.304 --> 01:28:31.439
FOR THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OR

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:34.308
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE FOR- THE

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.576
COUNTIES THAT ARE IN RED WHOSE

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:39.914
HIGH SCHOOLS. AND MIDDLE

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:40.815
SCHOOLS ARE OPENING UP. I THINK

01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:43.685
DOCTOR SHOULD. YES CAN YOU ME

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:45.853
AHA. OKAY GREAT SO THE KIND OF

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.689
WILL ANSWER OF YOUR- I SO. OLD

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:50.725
AGAIN THE LOCAL UNFORTUNATE

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:51.993
LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY AND

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.294
THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AT

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:54.295
A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:55.496
THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY AROUND

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:56.964
THESE THINGS. AND I THINK

01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:58.866
THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW IN

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.968
IN THE IN THE TIMES TO TRY TO

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.704
BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE TO

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:03.905
HAVE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.473
GETTING PEOPLE BEGAN ARE AROUND

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.241
FACE COVERING SO. AS WAS

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:08.242
MENTIONED THAT IS A STATE

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:09.777
MANDATE THAT FACE COVERINGS

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.312
MUST BE WORN FOR EVERYONE THIRD

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:12.747
GRADE AN OLDER. AND THEN

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:13.848
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FOR

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:14.682
KINDERGARTEN THROUGH SECOND

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:16.417
GRADE AS WELL. AND THEN THE

01:29:16.484 --> 01:29:17.652
PHYSICAL DISTANCING SO AGAIN

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:18.986
BUT I'M TRYING TO BE AS

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:20.555
PRACTICAL AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:22.290
SURE. YOU KNOW EVERY SCHOOL IS

01:29:22.356 --> 01:29:23.424
DIFFERENT AND THE SPACE IS

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:24.525
DIFFERENT AND THE SIZE THEY'RE

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:26.627
DIFFERENT SO. THE AND TO ANSWER

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.529
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE COURT

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.498
NUMBERS SO THE COURT NUMBERS-

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:31.766
ARE REALLY FOR OUR SCHOOLS THAT

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:33.801
HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO FULL

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:35.103
TO EVEN PARTIAL IN PERSON

01:29:35.169 --> 01:29:36.671
INSTRUCTION. TO ALLOW FOR THOSE

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:38.406
HIGH NEEDS CHILDREN. OR

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:39.841
CHILDREN HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS TO

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.042
START TO COME BACK. I THINK

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:43.177
ONCE YOU GET INTO EVEN THE

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.312
HYBRID OR PARTIAL IN PERSON

01:29:44.378 --> 01:29:45.780
INSTRUCTION YOU WE WANTED. TO

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:47.582
HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND LOCAL

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:48.683
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE ECHOED

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:49.751
AND AGAIN I HAVING BEEN A LOCAL

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:50.384
HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR SOME

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:52.253
MYSELF IT IS REALLY HELPFUL FOR

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.921
EACH LOCAL DISTRICT. AND LOCAL

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:55.323
SCHOOL TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:56.724
TO TRY TO DETERMINE HOW CAN

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.226
THEY BEST SET UP THEIR

01:29:58.292 --> 01:29:59.894
CLASSROOMS. TO PHYSICALLY

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.329
DOESN'T THE CHILDREN TO ALLOW

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:02.063
FOR COHORTS AND ALLOW FOR

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:04.165
STAFFING AND SAFE WAY- SO IT

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.566
IS. AGAIN THESE GUIDING

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.068
PRINCIPLES ARE THE SAME ACROSS

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:08.169
ALL THESE DIFFERENT GUIDANCES

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:10.037
BUT- TRYING TO ALLOW FOR THAT

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:11.606
BALANCE WE'RE ALL TRYING TO

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:13.174
BALANCE I THINK THE- THE

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.810
POTENTIAL FOR. A TRANSMISSION

01:30:15.877 --> 01:30:17.311
AND PREVENTING TRANSMISSION IN

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:19.547
THAT SETTING BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:20.748
HOW TO HAVE THE BEST ACTUAL

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:26.921
INSTRUCTION. FOR CHILDREN IN

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:28.022
THESE IN PERSON SETTINGS. SO I

DON'T. THINK FAN JUST ADD IN A

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.325
ROW THE CALIFORNIA. OF A-

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:32.960
GUIDANCE GUIDING WITH BASED ON.

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:34.829
THAT PRINT. PUBLISHED BY THE

PDP. AND THEN ALL OF. ARE FOR

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:38.166
WAS. AROUND THE EDUCATIONAL

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:40.802
COMPONENT. FOR AN INSTRUCTIONAL

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.570
MODELS. THAT ARE DISTRICTS

01:30:42.637 --> 01:30:43.704
WOULD BE LOOKING AT AS THEY

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:46.040
LOOK TO RE OPEN. AND SO OUR

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.074
FOCUS WAS MAINLY ON THE

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:49.977
EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT OF RE

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.280
OPENING. THANK YOU AND I JUST

01:30:52.346 --> 01:30:54.348
DR PAN AGAIN JUST BECAUSE I'M A

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:56.150
LITTLE CONFUSED BY ALL THIS AND

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:56.918
WHAT'S GOING ON ACTUALLY IN MY

01:30:56.984 --> 01:31:00.321
COUNTY- IT IS THE COUNTY HEALTH

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.690
OFFICER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:04.392
POLICING THE SCHOOLS. IF YOU

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:05.660
WILL I GUESS THAT'S NOT A GREAT

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:09.664
WORD BUT. WELL I'D SAY AT AN

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.599
EXTREME THE LOCAL HELD HER IN A

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:13.334
COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER OR LOCAL

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:14.402
HEALTH OFFICER BECAUSE THERE

01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:16.604
ARE THREE CITIES HELLO THIRTY

01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:17.905
TO CLOSE THE SCHOOL AND

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:21.542
CERTAINLY HAVE AUTHORITY TO- TO

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:22.944
ENFORCE LOCAL HOLD ON THIS

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:23.945
ORDER IS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.246
COURSES YOU KNOW HAVE A HUGE

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.614
SPECTRUM SO. I THINK THE

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.316
ABILITY TO PHYSICALLY ENFORCER

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:29.884
PHYSICALLY THE ON SITE IS NOT

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.986
FEASIBLE FOR LOCAL HEALTH

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:33.087
DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:33.988
ALSO DEALING WITH ALL OF THE

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:36.224
DIFFERENT SECTORS- BUT BUT

01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:37.592
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW ENFORCEMENT

01:31:37.658 --> 01:31:39.460
IS AN ISSUE IN MANY SECTORS

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:40.928
INCLUDING SCHOOLS AND WE'VE

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:41.863
DEFINITELY BEEN HEARING ABOUT

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:43.464
SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWING

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:44.932
THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:46.367
STATE HEALTH GUIDELINES. THANK

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.736
YOU MY LAST QUESTION I PROMISE

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:50.071
IS IF THERE SHOULD BECOME A

01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:50.938
VACCINE IS THEIR THOUGHT

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:55.509
PROCESS AS FAR AS- THE BUDGET

01:31:55.576 --> 01:31:57.812
AND- ANY BILL WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.580
APPROPRIATED ON- INSURING THE

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:01.616
CHILDREN WERE VACCINATED PRIOR

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:07.388
TO- RETURNING TO SCHOOL. ANY

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:08.589
THOUGHTS ONCE THERE'S A VACCINE

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:09.590
HAVE WE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:14.395
THE. I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:18.833
CHEAPER THAN THE- TESTING EVERY.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.868

THE MIND WITHOUT EDUCATING THE

HEART. IS NO EDUCATION AT ALL.

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:04.005

IN OUR GUIDANCE WE MADE A HEAVY

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:32.760
EMPHASIS ON ENSURING THAT THAT

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:34.962
NOT ONLY WILD TEACHERS WERE

OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:52.379
INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. SEEING HOW

I SPECIFICALLY WOULD LIKE TO

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:56.243
LOOK INTO HOW WE CAN PLANET

01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:57.745
TAKE AWAY THE SILOS BETWEEN

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.413
EDUCATION AND HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.415

START TO BREAK THE SILOS DOWN

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:10.991
THINK ABOUT TELEHEALTH IS THERE

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:12.993
AN OPPORTUNITY NOW FOR US TO

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.929

INCENTIVE TO FILL THEM OUT

QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE THE

AMONG CERTAIN CBO SCHOOL

01:47:31.244 --> 01:47:35.015
DISTRICTS. WHO HAVE HAD SOME

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:36.783
CONCERNS AROUND AND DUPLICATED

01:47:36.850 --> 01:47:38.285
PERCENTAGES WHICH IS YOU KNOW

01:47:38.351 --> 01:47:39.820
WHAT WE WERE FOR THAT'S THE

01:47:39.886 --> 01:47:41.021
SORT OF THE SHORTHAND TERM FOR-

01:47:41.087 --> 01:47:42.722
THE PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS

THAT GENERATE SUPPLEMENTAL AND

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:45.559
CONCENTRATION GRANTS FUNDS AND

01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:47.227
THE LARGEST OF THOSE BEING

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:48.495
THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE. FOR

01:47:48.562 --> 01:47:50.430
FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS

01:47:50.497 --> 01:47:53.533
ONE OF- ONE OF THE AS

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.336
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF- THE

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:58.004
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROVIDING

01:47:58.071 --> 01:48:00.640
A WAIVER TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:48:00.707 --> 01:48:01.541
ALLOW THEM TO RUN THEIR STE

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:02.809
THEIR SUMMER MEAL PROGRAMS

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:04.578
INSTEAD OF THEIR NORMAL SCHOOL

01:48:04.644 --> 01:48:05.212
MEAL PROGRAMS WHICH IS A VERY

01:48:05.278 --> 01:48:06.980
EXCELLENT THING- BECAUSE IT

01:48:07.047 --> 01:48:10.083
ALLOWS- EVERYONE'S NO KIDS TO

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:11.117
GET FAT AS YOU MENTION. IS THAT

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:11.718
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:13.520
REQUIREMENTS AROUND FAMILIES

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:14.921
FILLING OUT FREE AND REDUCED

01:48:14.988 --> 01:48:17.791
PRICE MEAL APPLICATIONS- TO

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:19.292
HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEIR

01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:20.560
COLLECTION OF THE STATE AT THE

01:48:20.627 --> 01:48:21.728
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:48:21.795 --> 01:48:23.897
RECENTLY EXTENDED. THE TIME

01:48:23.964 --> 01:48:25.999
PERIOD BY WHICH SUCH AS SCHOOLS

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:27.434
HAVE TO REPORT THEIR FREE AND

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:28.969
REDUCED PRICE MEAL ELIGIBILITY

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:30.637
BY TWO MONTHS. SO NOW THAT

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:31.705
INFORMATION IS NOT DUE UNTIL

01:48:31.771 --> 01:48:33.139
THE END OF DECEMBER OR START

01:48:33.206 --> 01:48:36.743
MID DECEMBER I BELIEVE- SO THAT

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:38.211
HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND WE'VE

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.880
HEARD A LOT OF VIDEOS THAT'S

01:48:39.946 --> 01:48:40.447
VERY HELPFUL IN GETTING THE

01:48:40.513 --> 01:48:43.383
INFORMATION AND- MANY MANY OF

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:44.517
OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE

01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:45.719
WOULD EXPECT THIS GIVEN THE

01:48:45.785 --> 01:48:47.287
ECONOMIC. CONDITIONS THAT WERE

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.755
AND ARE ACTUALLY REPORTING THAT

01:48:48.822 --> 01:48:50.724
THEY HAVE MORE. SCREEN REDUCE

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:52.325
PRICE NO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND

01:48:52.392 --> 01:48:54.661
FAMILIES THAN THEY HAD IN

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:56.429
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. SO OUR

01:48:56.496 --> 01:48:59.566
HOPE IS THAT- SCHOOLS CAN GET

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:01.835
THE DOCUMENTATION- OF THEIR

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:03.270
FAMILIES PRIOR TO THAT

01:49:03.336 --> 01:49:10.543
EXTENDED- THAT- MANY SCHOOLS

01:49:10.610 --> 01:49:11.711
MAY SEE THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:13.079
HIGHER FREE INTRODUCED PERSONAL

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:14.981
PERCENTAGES. THAN OTHERWISE WE

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:16.216
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IN

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:16.950
TERMS OF THEIR ENGAGE WITH

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:18.818
FAMILIES. I'M TO BE REACHING

01:49:18.885 --> 01:49:20.253
OUT AND GETTING THE INFORMATION

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.121
FROM THOSE FAMILIES SO THAT

01:49:21.187 --> 01:49:22.455
THEY CAN ALSO ASCERTAIN WHAT

01:49:22.522 --> 01:49:24.157
OTHER NEEDS AS FAMILIES HAVE.

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:25.825
SO AT THIS POINT- WE BELIEVE

01:49:25.892 --> 01:49:28.228
THAT THE- ADDITIONAL TIME WILL

01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:29.763
BE HELPFUL IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:31.264
GETTING THE PAPERBACK THE

01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:32.365
PAPERWORK BACK FROM FAMILIES

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:34.467
BUT WE ARE AWARE AND ARE

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:35.068

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:37.070
BASIS. GREAT THANK YOU AND I

01:49:37.137 --> 01:49:38.271
GET A DISTRICT GETS A

01:49:38.338 --> 01:49:39.372
CONTINUING CONCERN THAT

01:49:39.439 --> 01:49:40.373
DISTRICTS HAVE SO I THINK WE

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.342
NEED TO WATCH CLOSELY. SO THEY

NOW. IF YOU DON'T IT'S OKAY I'M

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:18.558
JUST. YEAH I THINK MY ANSWER

SPECIFIC TO OUR NEW LAB ARE

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:21.494

NUMBER ELEVEN SCHOOLS AND ONE

01:53:29.569 --> 01:53:31.337
OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES. I'M NOT

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:32.872
SURE WHICH SPECIFIC LAB TESTS

01:53:32.939 --> 01:53:34.774
YOU ARE REFERRING TO BUT WE CAN

KNOW IT QUESTIONS ASKED-

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:56.529
EARLIER ABOUT THE TESTING AND

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:58.231
THE REAP THE REPORTING OF THAT

01:53:58.298 --> 01:54:00.500
TESTED TESTING AND THEN THE

01:54:00.567 --> 01:54:02.235
CASES LINKED TO SCHOOLS AND

01:54:02.302 --> 01:54:03.770
WILL BE REPORTED OUT OF THE

01:54:03.836 --> 01:54:05.071
DISTRICT LEVEL AT THE SCHOOL

DISTRICT LEVEL EVEN MAYBE THE

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:08.208
SCHOOL SITE LEVEL AND OTHERS

01:54:08.274 --> 01:54:10.276
CONCERNS ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:13.179
ALONG THOSE LINES. BUT AND THEN

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:14.314
LUMPING SOME CONCERNED ABOUT

NEXT DOOR THEY'RE OPEN. MY

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:25.191
DISTRICT IS SHUT DOWN SO I'M

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:26.859
GETTING BEAT UP ON THIS ISSUE

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.161
PRETTY HANDILY BY PARENTS WHO

01:54:28.228 --> 01:54:29.362
ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT JUST

01:54:29.429 --> 01:54:31.364
YOU KNOW A MILE AWAY SCHOOLS

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:31.965

01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:33.533
MODIFIED. THE SCHOOLS AND THAT

ARE OPEN THE SCHOOL THAT IS

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:36.336
OPEN OF MODIFIED BUT IT'S JUST

01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:39.439
A- IT'S A REAL CONCERN TO FOLKS

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.374
TO. LET MY DISTRICT HAVE KIDS

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:44.177

THINK A LOT OF MY COMMENTS MY

01:54:54.721 --> 01:54:55.154
COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND

01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:58.391
QUESTIONS SCHOOL RE OPENING HAS

01:54:58.458 --> 01:55:00.960
TO BE I HAVE I WOULD IMAGINE

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:02.295
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:03.963
EACH AND SINGLE EVERY SINGLE

01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:05.164
ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS IT'S AN

01:55:05.231 --> 01:55:06.532
ISSUE THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY

01:55:06.599 --> 01:55:08.901
GETTING QUESTIONS. AS ARCHER

01:55:08.968 --> 01:55:11.304
MENTIONED WE ARE ALL PARENTS OF

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:13.139
A PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN AND SO

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:14.641
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE FACE

01:55:14.707 --> 01:55:18.077
EVERY SINGLE DAY- I MEAN IT'S

01:55:18.144 --> 01:55:20.546
SOMETHING THAT REALLY- WE NEED

01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:21.614
I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:23.116
THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING

01:55:23.182 --> 01:55:24.717
POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF.

01:55:24.784 --> 01:55:26.052
COORDINATION BETWEEN

01:55:26.119 --> 01:55:27.887
DEPARTMENTS EDUCATION BUT FROM

01:55:27.954 --> 01:55:29.088
A PUBLIC HEALTH PLUS ALL OUR

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:31.424
VARIOUS LOCAL COUNTIES AND

01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:33.059
THEIR DESTRUCTION OF QUIET THE

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:34.994
VERY CHALLENGING ENTERPRISE

01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:35.495
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE EVERY

01:55:35.561 --> 01:55:39.198
DISTRICT HAS COMPLETED LOCAL

01:55:39.265 --> 01:55:40.333
AUTHORITY AND AUTONOMY. BUT I

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.167
THINK WE HAVE AS A STAY HAVE TO

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:44.537
DO EVERYTHING. POSSIBLE TO WORK

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:47.573
TO GET OUR SCHOOLS. OPEN

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:50.276
SAFELY- IN A MANNER THAT SAY

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:51.811
FOR OUR TEACHERS SAY FOR OUR

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:53.813
CHILDREN STAY FOR THE STAFF- I

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:57.984
KNOW THAT'S ALL OUR GOAL- I AM

01:55:58.051 --> 01:56:00.286
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE-

01:56:00.353 --> 01:56:01.988
DIVIDE IN TERMS OF EQUITY

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:03.756
BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO SEE.

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:05.725
MANY OF OUR PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:07.393
SAN FRANCISCO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:08.961
THE OPENING GUIDELINES ARE

01:56:09.028 --> 01:56:11.164
STARTING TO OPEN AGAIN. BUT OUR

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:13.966
PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE VERY SLOW TO

01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:17.770
DO THAT- I WOULD POINT TO A

01:56:17.837 --> 01:56:20.239
PARTICULAR MODEL THAT HOUSE-

01:56:20.306 --> 01:56:22.175
STARTED WORKING IN TERMS OF

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:23.609
SOME SUCCESS WHICH IS IN SAN

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:24.544
MATEO COUNTY THE OTHER COUNTY

01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:26.813
THE REPRESENT. WHERE YOU HAVE

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:28.281
THE DISTRICTS WORKING VERY

01:56:28.348 --> 01:56:30.650
CLOSELY WITH THEIR- COUNTY

01:56:30.717 --> 01:56:31.984
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:35.955
ENSURE THAT THERE IS A PROPER

01:56:36.022 --> 01:56:37.056
TESTING PROTOCOLS. BEING

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:38.391
DEVELOPED- IN THAT TESTING

01:56:38.458 --> 01:56:39.492
AGAIN JUST TO FOLLOW UP WITH MY

01:56:39.559 --> 01:56:41.361
COLLEAGUE FROM PALM BEACH IS

01:56:41.427 --> 01:56:42.061
TALK ABOUT THAT TESTING IS

01:56:42.128 --> 01:56:44.330
PROBABLY. ONE OF THE MAJOR

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:46.966
ISSUES FOR TEACHERS AS THEY

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:49.168
STRUGGLE WITH WET WEATHER TO

01:56:49.235 --> 01:56:51.871
COME BACK OR NOT SO IN TERMS OF

01:56:51.938 --> 01:56:55.007
JUST. GOING TO. BACK TO DOCTOR

01:56:55.074 --> 01:56:57.377
POND IS YOU KNOW ARE YOU ARE

01:56:57.443 --> 01:57:00.313
YOU GIVING- GUIDANCE TO THE

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:01.547
COUNTIES AND LOCAL DISTRICTS

01:57:01.614 --> 01:57:03.916
ABOUT- TESTING PROTOCOLS RIGHT

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:06.886
NOW I THINK. THE IDEA OR THE

01:57:06.953 --> 01:57:08.121
CURRENT GUIDELINES PLEASE CREEK

01:57:08.187 --> 01:57:11.424
FROM WRONG IS TO. TEST TEACHERS

01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:13.126
POTENTIALLY ONCE EVERY TWO

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:14.627
MONTHS MAYBE THAT'S MY LOCAL

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:16.262
GUIDANCE PERSISTS AT THE STATE

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:18.564
GUIDANCE. BUT ARE YOU ARE YOU

01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:21.501
STARTING TO- TRY TO DEVELOP

01:57:21.567 --> 01:57:23.836
GUIDANCE IN RELATION WITH

01:57:23.903 --> 01:57:26.005
SEEDEATER. LET DISTRICTS KNOW

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:27.573
RICK BROTHER YOU KNOW WHAT IS

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.175
WHAT IS CONSIDERED SAFE TESTING

01:57:29.242 --> 01:57:33.212
PROTOCOLS FOR OUR TEACHERS AS

01:57:33.279 --> 01:57:33.780
THEY START TO CONSIDER GOING

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:37.450
BACK. SO YES WE ARE WORKING

01:57:37.517 --> 01:57:38.017
VERY CLOSELY AGAIN WITH- THE

01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:39.752
WORKGROUP THERE'S A WORKING

01:57:39.819 --> 01:57:40.920
GROUP WORKING WHETHER TESTING

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:43.055
TEST FOR THE MINISTRATION- AND

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:44.223
OUR PARTNERS AT. THE STATE

01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:46.192
BOARD OF EDUCATION AND CD AND

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:47.994
ALSO- PARTITION OF THE LABOR

01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:49.996
MANAGEMENT REGARDING TESTING I

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.631
THINK FOR THE MOST PART

01:57:51.697 --> 01:57:52.865
RESOURCES THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:55.134
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT. IS TO

01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:56.169
MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THERE IS A

01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:58.204
CASE THAT THAT PERSON IS TESTED

01:57:58.271 --> 01:57:59.038
IN THAT CLOSE CONTACTS ARE

01:57:59.105 --> 01:58:01.274
TESTED- INTERNET OF PEOPLE ARE

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.909
TESTED THAT IS AFTER THE PARTY

01:58:02.975 --> 01:58:04.610
AND THAT IS YOUKNOW THERE ARE

01:58:04.677 --> 01:58:05.478
PLENTY OF REASONS FOR THAT AS

01:58:05.545 --> 01:58:07.079
WELL AND THEN. WE ARE CONTINUE

01:58:07.146 --> 01:58:08.080
TO WORK ON THE INVOLVING

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:11.651
TESTING GUIDELINES ABOUT ANY

01:58:11.717 --> 01:58:13.052
TESTING GONNA. SWIM WITH THIS

01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:17.790
KIND OF BE RELEASE. WHAT IT IS.

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:18.724
THE WORD IT IS ACTUALLY MEETING

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:20.393
AND AGAIN THIS THE SCIENCE THAT

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:23.529
CONTINUES TO EVOLVE YOU KNOW

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:25.598
ACROSS THE NATION AS WELL. SO

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:26.899
I'M TAKING THAT AS A I DON'T

01:58:26.966 --> 01:58:27.733
KNOW WHEN YOU WERE IN THE

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:28.868
MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR SO I

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:31.370
DON'T KNOW HOW. YOU ANTICIPATE

01:58:31.437 --> 01:58:33.072
LOCAL DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE TO

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:33.573
BARGAIN MANY OF THESE

01:58:33.639 --> 01:58:36.042
CONTRACTS. ONE OF WHICH IS

01:58:36.108 --> 01:58:37.276
STICKING POINTS IS WHICH IS

01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:40.046
TESTING- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A

01:58:40.112 --> 01:58:43.316
LABOR. LAWYER BUT YOU KNOW IF

01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:43.850
YOU DON'T COME OUT WITH

01:58:43.916 --> 01:58:46.085
TESTING. PROTOCOLS FOR OUR

01:58:46.152 --> 01:58:48.488
STATE IT PUTS OUR DISTRICTS IN

01:58:48.554 --> 01:58:50.423
A VERY TOUGH. POSITIONS A WIN

01:58:50.490 --> 01:58:51.858
WITH THOSE GUIDELINES BE

01:58:51.924 --> 01:58:53.092
RELEASED WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:58:53.159 --> 01:58:54.627
A SCHOOL YEAR AND WITHOUT THIS

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:57.196
KIND ON SEPT MIGHT BE VERY

01:58:57.263 --> 01:58:57.697
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR

01:58:57.763 --> 01:59:00.800
SCHOOLS TO OPEN UP. SO AS AS IS

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:02.468
ALREADY IN OUR JULY GUIDANCE I

01:59:02.535 --> 01:59:03.636
THINK THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:05.271
RECOMMENDATIONS THERE AND AS I

01:59:05.338 --> 01:59:06.672
MENTIONED THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.441
GUIDELINES AROUND FIRST TESTING

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:09.976
OF SYSTEMATIC CASES AND

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:12.945
CONTACTS. CAN YOU REFERRAL I

01:59:13.012 --> 01:59:14.780
APOLOGIZE SINCE JULY FEELS LIKE

01:59:14.847 --> 01:59:15.848
FIVE YEARS AGO CAN YOU REFRESH

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:16.983
MY MEMORY AS TO WHAT THOSE

01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:18.651
GUYS. GOT WHAT THAT GUIDANCE

01:59:18.718 --> 01:59:21.554
WAS. SO IT TALKS ABOUT A

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:22.922
POTENTIAL IN IT YOU ALSO NEED

01:59:22.989 --> 01:59:24.457
TO VERY IT BASED ON THE LOCAL

01:59:24.524 --> 01:59:25.625
CONDITIONS N THE LOCAL I.

01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:27.560
PENOLOGY THE LEVEL OF SPREAD.

01:59:27.627 --> 01:59:29.662
OR ONE LITTLE TRANSMISSION AND

01:59:29.729 --> 01:59:31.163
THE COMMUNITY THAT IS WHY THERE

01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:32.231
IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:59:32.298 --> 01:59:33.866
POTENTIALLY BUT IN THE JULY

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:35.268
GUIDANCE WE TALK ABOUT ONE

01:59:35.334 --> 01:59:37.303
PARTICULAR CONDITION TO BE-

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:40.973
TESTING- BELIEVE IT'S 25% EVERY

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:41.841
TWO MONTHS IS A BIT OF A

01:59:41.908 --> 01:59:42.542
CONDITION AND AGAIN THE MOST

01:59:42.608 --> 01:59:44.043
IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION THAT

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:45.244
WE'VE ALREADY MADE IS TESTING

01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:48.881
RESOURCES FOR. THIS OUR- CASES

01:59:48.948 --> 01:59:50.082
AND CONTACTS. I'M SORRY CAN YOU

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:52.051
REPEAT THAT THE BLACK THE LAST

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:53.653
TWO AGAIN NOT I COULDN'T VERY

01:59:53.719 --> 01:59:55.421
CLEARLY APOLOGIZE. THE MOST

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:56.989
IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION THERE

01:59:57.056 --> 01:59:57.990

01:59:58.057 --> 02:00:01.060
CONTACTS IN THE SETTINGS AND

02:00:01.127 --> 02:00:01.460
NOT IS ALREADY THE

02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:02.628
RECOMMENDATION. TESTING CASES

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:05.264
IN CONTEXT MEANING THAT IF- YOU

02:00:05.331 --> 02:00:06.832
GET A POSITIVE SOMEONE GETS A

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:09.168
POSITIVE TEST- BUT THE

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:10.136
CHALLENGES IF YOU'RE TESTING

02:00:10.202 --> 02:00:14.140
ONLY EVERY TWO MONTHS. SOMEBODY

02:00:14.206 --> 02:00:15.408
COULD HAVE EXPOSED THE ENTIRE

02:00:15.474 --> 02:00:20.413
SCHOOL THAT TWO MONTHS. PERIOD.

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:22.949
SO AGAIN THIS YOU KNOW I THINK

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.050
ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS WE

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:25.751

YOU CAN IDENTIFY THEM QUICKLY

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:38.197
IDENTIFY THE CONTACTS SO THOSE

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:38.664
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:43.402
PRINCIPLES. RIGHT BUT- COULD

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:44.704
LOOK LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT TO

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:48.941

NURSING FACILITIES I'M JUST

02:01:06.859 --> 02:01:09.195
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU

02:01:09.261 --> 02:01:11.797
BRING. CHILDREN SO THOSE

02:01:11.864 --> 02:01:13.499
PROBLEMS RIGHT THOSE SETTINGS

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:14.934
ARE RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS ARE

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:16.068
CONGREGATE LIVING SETTINGS AND

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:18.871
IT'S ALSO ALL ADULTS SO AGAIN

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:20.473
YOU KNOW I THINK THE OTHER.

THING THAT- BUT NOTHING KENNEDY

02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:24.043
AFTER X. AND OTHERS HAVE

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:25.745
CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW THE STUDY

02:01:25.811 --> 02:01:26.679
IN THE YOU KNOW MORE MORE

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:28.314
EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT YOUNG

02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:30.016
CHILDREN ARE LESS LIKELY TO

02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:31.651
HAVE SERIOUS HONEST THEY'RE

02:01:31.717 --> 02:01:34.120
LESS LIKELY TO INFECT OTHERS. I

02:01:34.186 --> 02:01:36.355
AM IN CONTACT OF EDUCATION- OF

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:38.991
RESOURCES YOU KNOW AND- STUDIES

02:01:39.058 --> 02:01:40.893
LESS THAN ONE LESS THAN 10% OF

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:42.695
THE INDEX CASES ARE TYPICALLY

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:43.963
CHILDREN TO CHILDREN MUSCLES

02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:45.498
OKAY JUST READ SO IT'S A VERY

02:01:45.564 --> 02:01:46.365
DIFFERENT SETTING THAN A

02:01:46.432 --> 02:01:50.269
RESIDENTIAL SETTING. WITH ADULT

02:01:50.336 --> 02:01:51.137
AND ELDERLY. NO I COMPLETELY

02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:52.171
MISSED AND I THINK AS A- WITH

02:01:52.238 --> 02:01:54.707
YOUNGER CHILDREN I TOTALLY

02:01:54.774 --> 02:01:58.344
UNDERSTAND- THE REST LEVEL FOR

02:01:58.411 --> 02:01:59.979
THEM I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS

02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:00.946
HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THE

02:02:01.013 --> 02:02:03.582
TEACHERS AND THE JANITORS AND

02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:04.950
THE- PRINCIPLES IN THE

02:02:05.017 --> 02:02:07.153
ADMINISTRATORS. IN THE NURSES

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:08.621

NOW- MANY OF THEM ARE CONCERNED

02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:14.960
ABOUT. GOING BACK. SO THAT IS

02:02:15.027 --> 02:02:16.762
EXACTLY WHY WE AREN'T IN THIS

02:02:16.829 --> 02:02:17.830
WORKING GROUP AND WORKING

THE BEST WAY TO GET. TO YOUR

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:26.872
POINT TO HELP GET OUR SCHOOLS

02:02:26.939 --> 02:02:29.775

SUMMERTIME AFTER SCHOOL SO WE

02:02:42.755 --> 02:02:44.490
OFFER I THINK I THINK WHAT I'M

02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:45.958
TRYING TO CONVEY IS THAT IS NOT

02:02:46.025 --> 02:02:47.226
A REQUIREMENT OR RECOMMENDATION

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:49.161
IN ORDER TO REOPEN SCHOOLS I'M

02:02:49.228 --> 02:02:50.096
BUT I'M TRYING TO CONVEY THAT

02:02:50.162 --> 02:02:51.230
PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THIS GUY

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:53.032
HAS TO GO TO REOPEN THE SCHOOLS

02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:55.267
AND THAT. YOU HAVE TEACHERS AND

02:02:55.334 --> 02:02:57.436
THE TEACHERS ARE DISCUSSING

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:58.671
THIS WITH EACH OF THEIR

02:02:58.738 --> 02:03:01.407
DISTRICTS AND AS FAR AS I CAN

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:02.908
TELL IN THE VERY LIMITED

02:03:02.975 --> 02:03:04.710
KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE TALKING

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:06.112
TO THE FEW DISTRICT THAT I

02:03:06.178 --> 02:03:08.547
REPRESENT IS EVERYBODY IS ALL

02:03:08.614 --> 02:03:10.516
OVER THE MAP. IN THIS TESTING

02:03:10.583 --> 02:03:12.818
ISSUE IS CENTRAL TO EVERY

02:03:12.885 --> 02:03:15.588
BARGAINING DISCUSSION UP AND

02:03:15.654 --> 02:03:16.756
DOWN THE STATE. SO WHAT I'M

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:18.390
TRYING TO CONVEY IS WHAT YOU'RE

02:03:18.457 --> 02:03:21.060
SAYING HEY. DISTRICTS YOU CAN

02:03:21.127 --> 02:03:21.594
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WE'VE

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.562
GIVEN YOU. A LITTLE BIT OF

02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:25.197
GUIDANCE BUT NOT REALLY MUCH

02:03:25.264 --> 02:03:28.334
DIRECTION. AND GO FORTH AND DO

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.469
YOUR BEST I'M SAYING THAT.

02:03:30.536 --> 02:03:33.372
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF GUIDANCE

02:03:33.439 --> 02:03:35.474
SCHOOLS MOST LIKELY. MAY NOT

02:03:35.541 --> 02:03:38.010
OPEN UP BECAUSE TEACHERS AND

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:38.577
STAFF ARE NOT WILLING TO GO

02:03:38.644 --> 02:03:43.115
BACK. SO WHERE AREYOU GOING TO

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:45.451
BE ISSUING FURTHER GUIDANCE

02:03:45.518 --> 02:03:50.890
BECAUSE- I THINK AGAIN. LET ME

02:03:50.956 --> 02:03:52.558
LET ME JUST BE EXTRAORDINARILY

02:03:52.625 --> 02:03:57.029
CLEAR. YOUR GUIDANCE MAY

02:03:57.096 --> 02:04:00.065
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

02:04:00.132 --> 02:04:03.369
SCHOOLS WILL RE OPEN OR NOT.

02:04:03.435 --> 02:04:05.571
SEOUL IS A TASK FORCE GOING TO

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:06.705

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:10.709

WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO THE BEST

02:04:18.517 --> 02:04:22.588
WE CAN. BUT I THINK THE ANSWER

02:04:22.655 --> 02:04:26.592
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN IS COMPLEELY.

02:04:26.659 --> 02:04:29.195
NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:34.400
DISTRICTS AND TEACHERS NEED. SO

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:16.695
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THIS

02:07:16.762 --> 02:07:17.496
VERY MUCH A LOCAL HEALTH

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:19.164
DEPARTMENT ROLE. TO WORK

02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:20.199
CLOSELY WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND-

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:21.967
AND THERE'S YOU KNOW WE DEAL

02:07:22.034 --> 02:07:23.936
WITH BOTH LOCAL AND STATE

02:07:24.003 --> 02:07:25.437

SETTINGS ALL THE TIME AND WORK

CLOSELY WITH THEIR SCHOOLS IN

02:07:30.809 --> 02:07:32.478
THE SETTINGS OF THIS IS JUST

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:34.313
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THERE

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:35.647
ARE MORE HER THE INFECTION THAT

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:36.582
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE WORRIED

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:38.317
ABOUT AND FOLLOWING UP ON THAT

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:39.351
THESE RELATIONSHIPS EXIST ON A

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:42.554
LOCAL LEVEL. AND A LOT OF-

02:07:42.621 --> 02:07:48.227
CLOSE WORK WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT.

02:07:48.293 --> 02:07:48.894
IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:50.195
IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO SEE IF

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:53.432
CALLING. OR CD WITH ABLE TO

02:07:53.499 --> 02:08:01.473
AFTER THAT. AS WELL. ABOUT THE

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:02.641
L. A. R. I THINK I WOULD JUST

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:04.376
SAY. IF YOU CAN WITH WITH ANY

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:05.778
OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE

02:08:05.844 --> 02:08:06.812
PRESENTATION I THINK WE TRIED

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:08.514
TO HIGHLIGHT. THE FACT THAT

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:09.615
LOTS OF THE DECISIONS ARE MADE

02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:11.283
IT MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:13.085
THINK WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU

02:08:13.152 --> 02:08:13.919
WANTED TO GET SOME MORE

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:15.487
SPECIFIC GUIDANCE. THAT WOULD

02:08:15.554 --> 02:08:16.822
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCRETE

02:08:16.889 --> 02:08:17.956
FOR DISTRICTS YOU DO END UP IN

02:08:18.023 --> 02:08:18.991
SITUATIONS WHERE FOR MANY

02:08:19.058 --> 02:08:21.493
DISTRICTS THAT BECOMES. MORE OF

02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:22.327
A CHALLENGE IN IMPLEMENTING.

02:08:22.394 --> 02:08:23.429
SOME FOR EXAMPLE MAY NOT NOT

02:08:23.495 --> 02:08:24.997
HAVE THE FACILITIES BASE TO

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:26.732
KEEP. A KID THAT'S GOOD PART.

02:08:26.799 --> 02:08:28.767
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. THAT

02:08:28.834 --> 02:08:30.235
THAT THAT YOU ALL OF. ME TO

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:31.003
THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ONE

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:32.271
OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF FIGURE

02:08:32.337 --> 02:08:33.906
OUT WHAT THE BEST WAYS TO OPEN

02:08:33.972 --> 02:08:36.341
BUT I THINK WE- IT. IT'S IT

02:08:36.408 --> 02:08:37.309
MISTER THEY'RE WALKING.

02:08:37.376 --> 02:08:38.343
CONTINUE CONSTANT MONITORING

02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:39.578
AND EVEN IF THERE WAS MORE

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:40.746
SPECIFIC ITEMS. I NEED TO

02:08:40.813 --> 02:08:42.514
CONSTANTLY MONITOR REVIEW AND

02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:43.782
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE TO.

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:44.650
MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE BEING

02:08:44.716 --> 02:08:49.321
IMPLEMENTED- AS AS- THE LAPSES

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:51.990
YOU THINK SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THE

02:08:52.057 --> 02:08:53.158
GREAT FAN I JUST WOULD LIKE TO.

02:08:53.225 --> 02:08:56.562
THAT OUR- TROOPER. HAS CAN.

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:57.930
PEOPLE LOOKING RE OPENING THAT

02:08:57.996 --> 02:08:59.631
INCLUDES OUR LARGEST CITIES

02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:02.501
LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND LA AND

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:05.204
TO FOCUS ON DETECTING TRACING

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:08.140
AND PP AVAILABILITY ALL AS PART

02:09:08.207 --> 02:09:10.843
OF EFFORTS TO GET SCHOOLS OPEN.

02:09:10.909 --> 02:09:12.244
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:09:12.311 --> 02:09:14.613
BEEN ON HE STARTED A LAST WEEK

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:16.548
A WITH THE BIG CITY MAYORS AND

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:17.616
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT WE

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:21.553
MUST WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.722
THAT OUR SCHOOL CAN OPEN SAFELY.

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:25.057
THE SUPER TECHNOLOGIST AGAIN

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:27.359
URGE YOU TO INCORPORATE-

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:28.460
TESTING INTO THOSE

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:29.761
CONVERSATIONS I THINK IT'S VERY

02:09:29.828 --> 02:09:32.164
CRITICAL. AS I'M HEARING FROM

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:35.334
FROM MY DISTRICTS AND FROM. MY

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:36.735
TEACHERS BUT I THINK IT'S

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:38.036
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT THAT

02:09:38.103 --> 02:09:41.039
THERE ARE. BECOME SOME GREATER.

02:09:41.106 --> 02:09:42.875
RAIDER GUIDANCE AROUND TESTING

02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:44.343
JUST BECAUSE THERE IS THERE IS

02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:45.244
REAL FEAR BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:47.012
TELLING EVERYONE TO STAY HOME.

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:49.181
AND WE HAVE A GROUP OF

02:09:49.248 --> 02:09:50.983
ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:52.951
ASKED TO GO TO WORK AND WE SEEM

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:53.986
WITH THEIR INFECTION RATES ARE

02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:56.121
SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AS

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:57.689
WORKERS ARE BEING ASKED TO

02:09:57.756 --> 02:09:59.324
LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND GO INTO A

02:09:59.391 --> 02:10:01.426
WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT- THEY'RE

02:10:01.493 --> 02:10:03.462
LOOKING FOR GUIDANCE AND

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:05.631
GUIDELINES THAT PROVIDE THEM-

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:07.065
WORKPLACE SAFETY SO I THINK

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:09.001
IT'S TOTALLY REASONABLE

02:10:09.067 --> 02:10:09.735
EXPECTATION AND I HOPE THAT YOU

02:10:09.801 --> 02:10:13.105
ALL. THE CORPORATE THAT INTO

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:16.475
YOUR- INTO YOUR- DIALOGUE

02:10:16.542 --> 02:10:17.476

INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN

02:10:26.418 --> 02:10:28.020

INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT WAS WHEN

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:38.730

OF LOOKING AT SORT OF BASICALLY

02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:07.746
CASE ATES AND TEST POSITIVITY

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.614

WE FIRST HAVE THAT RE OPENING

02:13:13.985 --> 02:13:16.088
FRAMEWORK. WE HAD ALSO SAID

02:13:16.154 --> 02:13:18.056
THAT A SCHOOL COULD REOPEN

02:13:18.123 --> 02:13:19.891
AFTER TWO WEEKS OFF OF NOT

THAT WE DO NOT AS WIDESPREAD

02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:32.838
COMMITTEE TRANSMISSION. AND OF

COURSE THERE'S A HUGE SPECTRUM

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:35.640
ABOVE THAT IT COULD BE RIGHT AT

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:37.142
THE BORDER OR COULD BE WAY OFF

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:39.044

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:15.180
WE TO YOU KNOW INCREASE OUR

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:16.148
TESTING CAPACITY THE THAT

02:14:16.214 --> 02:14:19.050
AMOUNT OF. FOR TEN NUMBER YOU

02:14:19.117 --> 02:14:20.786
KNOW RANGE OF TEST NUMBERS GET

02:14:20.852 --> 02:14:22.621
COMMUNICATED TO THE DISTRICTS

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:24.856
STATEWIDE THEY CAN HAVE SOME

02:14:24.923 --> 02:14:26.658
LEVEL OF EXPECTATION HOW MANY-

02:14:26.725 --> 02:14:28.026
TESTING MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO I

02:14:28.093 --> 02:14:29.227
MEAN AGAIN THIS IS A VERY

02:14:29.294 --> 02:14:31.196
CENTRAL ISSUE IS ONE OF THE

02:14:31.263 --> 02:14:33.832
ISSUES THAT- KEEP TEACHERS FROM

02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:35.801
GOING BACK SO I THINK IF THERE.

02:14:35.867 --> 02:14:37.569
IS AN EXPECTATION THAT IT'S I

02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:39.171
DON'T KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:14:39.237 --> 02:14:40.806
TESTS ARE MILLION TESTS OR TEN

02:14:40.872 --> 02:14:42.441
MILLION WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS

02:14:42.507 --> 02:14:44.576
ON I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY

02:14:44.643 --> 02:14:46.611
HELPFUL SO IT'S NOT AN ABSTRACT

02:14:46.678 --> 02:14:48.847
WE HAVE. TEST AVAILABLE I MEAN

02:14:48.914 --> 02:14:52.083
DISTRICTS DISTRICTS HAVE X.

02:14:52.150 --> 02:14:53.018
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES INDEX

02:14:53.084 --> 02:14:55.620
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY I THINK

02:14:55.687 --> 02:14:56.988
THEY REALLY NEED TO KNOW YOU

02:14:57.055 --> 02:14:58.190
KNOW WHAT TO DO JUST ARE THEY

02:14:58.256 --> 02:15:02.127
ONLY GONNA GET LIKE. FIVE

02:15:02.194 --> 02:15:02.727
THOUSAND TIMES PER DISTRICT OR

02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:03.328
THIS CAN BE A LOT. Là MORE

02:15:03.395 --> 02:15:05.330
SORT REALLY TRYING TO HAVE A

02:15:05.397 --> 02:15:08.133
NUMERIC. RANGE OF WHAT MIGHT BE

02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:09.534
POSSIBLE AND OBVIOUSLY THAT

02:15:09.601 --> 02:15:11.169
CHANGES AS WE RAMP IT UP. BUT

02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:12.971
AS YOU KNOW I THINK WOULD BE

02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:15.640
VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. THANK

02:15:15.707 --> 02:15:18.210
YOU- I KNOW I HAVE MORE

02:15:18.276 --> 02:15:19.110
QUESTIONS WELL BUT I'M GONNA

02:15:19.177 --> 02:15:20.979
HOLD OFF BECAUSE I THINK WE GOT

02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:21.913
TO A LOT AND WE HAVE ONE MORE

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:23.682
PANEL. WHICH YOU REALLY WANT TO

02:15:23.748 --> 02:15:26.318

JUST ONE QUICK STATEMENT AND I

02:15:29.554 --> 02:15:32.924
THINK IT. IS REALLY HE DIDN'T

02:15:32.991 --> 02:15:34.192
SAY IT BUT I THINK HE- HE SEES

02:15:34.259 --> 02:15:36.094
IT. AND PROBABLY THE WAY I DO-

02:15:36.161 --> 02:15:38.196
WE HAVE A GLARING CIVIL RIGHTS

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:39.231
ISSUE EMERGING IN THE STATE IN

02:15:39.297 --> 02:15:42.000
THAT. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:43.068
OPENING AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE

02:15:43.134 --> 02:15:46.972
NOT. MORE VETTING ON A VACCINE

02:15:47.038 --> 02:15:48.240
WHAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO IS

02:15:48.306 --> 02:15:49.908
BE MUCH BETTER PREPARED FOR

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:51.476
THIS TO BE AROUND FOR SOME TIME

02:15:51.543 --> 02:15:53.578
AND GET TESTING INDOOR SCHOOLS

02:15:53.645 --> 02:15:55.447
THAT WE CAN SOMEWHAT. ATTEMPT

02:15:55.514 --> 02:15:57.349
TO CONTROL THAT ENVIRONMENT BUT

02:15:57.415 --> 02:15:58.717
THIS IS I THINK THE

02:15:58.783 --> 02:15:59.918
CONVERSATION YOU'RE HEARING

02:15:59.985 --> 02:16:02.287
TODAY THE TOPIC I JUST

02:16:02.354 --> 02:16:03.555
MENTIONED IT IS I THINK.

02:16:03.622 --> 02:16:05.824
EVERYBODY I WATCH IT BECAUSE

02:16:05.891 --> 02:16:07.692
IT'S COMMON. YEAH CONVERSELY

02:16:07.759 --> 02:16:09.127
I'M SORRY CAN I ADD TO THAT

02:16:09.194 --> 02:16:10.629
BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN ON

02:16:10.695 --> 02:16:12.197
THIS PANEL I WILL SAY WE KNOW

02:16:12.264 --> 02:16:13.198
THAT WOMEN ARE BEING

02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:14.432
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY

02:16:14.499 --> 02:16:16.034
CHILDREN STAYING HOME TO WERE

02:16:16.101 --> 02:16:17.202
DROPPING ON THE WORK FORCE TO

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:18.436
LARGER NUMBERS IT'S BECAUSE-

02:16:18.503 --> 02:16:20.872
IT'S- I KNOW. IT'S HARD FOR ME

02:16:20.939 --> 02:16:23.141
TO GET UP HERE TO DO MY JOB-

02:16:23.208 --> 02:16:23.775
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:25.577
FLEXIBILITY IN OUR JOBS. SO AND

02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:27.212
I KNOW INFECTS FATHERS TO BED

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:29.047
BUT MOTHERS IN PARTICULAR AND

02:16:29.114 --> 02:16:30.649
WE HAVE SPENT MORE TIME AND WE

02:16:30.715 --> 02:16:32.684
HAD I THINK CLEAR GUIDANCE ON

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:34.386
BARS AND MOVIE THEATRES THAN WE

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:36.187
HAVE ON SCHOOLS. WHAT IS

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:37.656
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE

02:16:37.722 --> 02:16:38.990
FOR THE SCHOOLS THE TESTING

02:16:39.057 --> 02:16:41.927
WITHOUT SPECIFIC GUIDELINES OR

02:16:41.993 --> 02:16:43.061
CLEAR GUIDELINES I THINK WHAT'S

02:16:43.128 --> 02:16:44.963
HAPPENING IS LIKE WE'RE TALKING

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:45.764
OF COURSE WHAT I THINK THAT

02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:47.566
SOUNDS GREAT. BUT IF IT'S NOT

02:16:47.632 --> 02:16:49.134
REQUIRED THEN WE HAVE SOME

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:50.168
SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPENING UP

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:50.936
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

02:16:51.002 --> 02:16:53.738
OPENING UP WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF-

02:16:53.805 --> 02:16:55.073
JUST MASKS BASICALLY THAT'S

02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:59.110
WHAT HAPPENED A VISTA UNIFIED.

02:16:59.177 --> 02:16:59.644
AND THEN EVERYBODY IN THE

02:16:59.711 --> 02:17:00.779
SURROUNDING. AREA T. PARENTS

02:17:00.845 --> 02:17:02.414
ARE THINKING OH MY GOD THAT YOU

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:04.749
CAN OPEN UP LIKE THAT I DON'T

02:17:04.816 --> 02:17:05.350
WANT MY SCHOOL TO OPEN UP LIKE

02:17:05.417 --> 02:17:07.252
THAT SO. WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN

02:17:07.319 --> 02:17:08.620
VERY CLEAR WITH OUR SCHOOL

02:17:08.687 --> 02:17:09.521
DISTRICTS WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR

02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:10.855
WITH THEIR TEACHERS. WE'RE NOT

02:17:10.922 --> 02:17:12.557
SAYING HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO-

02:17:12.624 --> 02:17:14.793
PROVIDE AS FAR AS TESTING- IF

02:17:14.859 --> 02:17:15.894
COHORTS ARE GONNA KEEP KIDS

02:17:15.961 --> 02:17:17.295
SAFE THAN REQUIRE COHORTS BUT

02:17:17.362 --> 02:17:18.997
LIKE LET'S. LET'S BE CLEAR SO

02:17:19.064 --> 02:17:20.498
KIDS CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL I

02:17:20.565 --> 02:17:21.433
THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE

02:17:21.499 --> 02:17:22.467
DOING IS WE'RE CREATING THE

02:17:22.534 --> 02:17:24.069
PERFECT STORM. WHERE PRIVATE

02:17:24.135 --> 02:17:25.136
SCHOOLS CAN FIGURE IT OUT

02:17:25.203 --> 02:17:26.004
THEY'VE ENOUGH MONEY TO FIGURE

02:17:26.071 --> 02:17:27.672
IT OUT. WE HAVE SOME PUBLIC

02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:28.807
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE JUST

02:17:28.873 --> 02:17:30.842
GO IN. LIKE THE WILD WEST IN

02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:32.344
AND RUNNING INTO PROBLEMS AND

02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:33.478
THOSE ARE THE STORIES WERE SEEN

02:17:33.545 --> 02:17:35.413
AND SO. IT'S PREVENTING

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.514
EVERYBODY ELSE WHO REALLY NEEDS

02:17:36.581 --> 02:17:37.716
THAT TO GET BACK THESE BIGGER

02:17:37.782 --> 02:17:40.151
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO I JUST I

02:17:40.218 --> 02:17:42.621
IMPLORE- THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:17:42.687 --> 02:17:44.389
PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I KNOW

02:17:44.456 --> 02:17:45.624
CITIES TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:46.358
HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:17:46.424 --> 02:17:48.159
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. BUT

02:17:48.226 --> 02:17:50.295
WE'VE GOT TO BE CLEAR WITH THE

02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:51.229

WHERE KIDS CAN GET A DIPLOMA

02:25:21.546 --> 02:25:23.181

BUDGETARY STANDPOINT BUT ALSO

02:25:36.227 --> 02:25:37.495
FROM. A LOSS OF EIGHTY A-

02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:38.763

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:10.286
OTHER AND IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT

02:47:10.353 --> 02:47:12.589
SCHOOLS DISTRICTS TEACHERS AND

02:47:12.655 --> 02:47:14.958
POLICYMAKERS ARE WORKING HARD

02:47:15.024 --> 02:47:15.959
TO RESPONDTO THE NEEDS OF THE

02:47:16.025 --> 02:47:18.461
MOMENT. WE AT ED TRUST WEST AND

02:47:18.528 --> 02:47:20.029
THOSE OF US IN THE EDUCATION

02:47:20.096 --> 02:47:22.565
EQUITY SPACE ALSO KNOW THAT

02:47:22.632 --> 02:47:25.034
LONG BEFORE CORONAVIRUS SCHOOL

02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:27.203
CLOSURES AND DISTANCE LEARNING

02:47:27.270 --> 02:47:31.007
CALIFORNIA FACED AN EPIDEMIC OF

02:47:31.074 --> 02:47:31.975
EDUCATION INEQUALITY. IT'S BEEN

02:47:32.041 --> 02:47:33.710
A SAD REALITY THAT FOR DECADES

02:47:33.777 --> 02:47:34.978
STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MOST

02:47:35.044 --> 02:47:37.881
RESOURCES OFTEN GET THE LEAST.

02:47:37.947 --> 02:47:39.449
WE GIVE STUDENTS OF COLOR AND

02:47:39.516 --> 02:47:41.251
LOW INCOME STUDENTS THE LEAST

02:47:41.317 --> 02:47:42.819
ACCESS TO CRITICAL COURSEWORK.

02:47:42.886 --> 02:47:44.721
HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS

02:47:44.788 --> 02:47:46.623
CRUCIAL TECHNOLOGY AND A HOST

02:47:46.689 --> 02:47:48.792
OF OTHER RESOURCES. WHEN OUR

02:47:48.858 --> 02:47:50.427
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DR ALCIA

02:47:50.493 --> 02:47:52.328
SMITH ARIANNA FIRST TESTIFIED

02:47:52.395 --> 02:47:53.730
ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSURES TO THIS

02:47:53.797 --> 02:47:55.965
COMMITTEE IN APRIL. WE THOUGHT

02:47:56.032 --> 02:47:56.766
SCHOOL CLOSURES WOULD BE

02:47:56.833 --> 02:47:58.535
TEMPORARY AND FOR A SHORT

02:47:58.601 --> 02:48:01.571
PERIOD OF TIME. AND NOW HERE WE

02:48:01.638 --> 02:48:02.172
ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE FALL

02:48:02.238 --> 02:48:04.841
SEMESTER. AND BASED ON A RECENT

02:48:04.908 --> 02:48:06.409
POLL OF K. TWELVE PARENTS BY

02:48:06.476 --> 02:48:08.311
ADDRESS WEST WE KNOW THE

02:48:08.378 --> 02:48:10.346
DISTANCE LEARNING IS NOT

02:48:10.413 --> 02:48:12.248
WORKING FOR MOST FAMILIES. THE

02:48:12.315 --> 02:48:13.750
DECISIONS THE CALIFORNIA MAKES

02:48:13.817 --> 02:48:15.752
RIGHT NOW WILL DETERMINE HOW WE

02:48:15.819 --> 02:48:17.420
TURN THIS CRISIS INTO AN

02:48:17.487 --> 02:48:19.355
OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER SERVE ALL

02:48:19.422 --> 02:48:21.724
STUDENTS. WELL THIS HEARING IS

02:48:21.791 --> 02:48:23.193

THE SAFE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS

02:48:25.061 --> 02:48:26.763
WE URGE THE COMMITTEE AND THE

02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:28.932
LEGISLATURE TO ALSO KEEP EQUITY

02:48:28.998 --> 02:48:30.033
CONSIDERATIONS AT THE

02:48:30.099 --> 02:48:32.101
FOREFRONT. AS WE PLAN FOR AND

02:48:32.168 --> 02:48:34.637
IMPLEMENT IN PERSON AND HYBRID

02:48:34.704 --> 02:48:37.340
INSTRUCTIONS. WE MUST REMEMBER

02:48:37.407 --> 02:48:40.043
THAT THE BEST SOLUTIONS COME

02:48:40.109 --> 02:48:41.311
FROM THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE

02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:43.313
PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY ADDRESS

02:48:43.379 --> 02:48:44.314
WEST CONDUCTED A STATE WIDE

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:46.850
PULL ON FAMILY'S EXPERIENCES IN

02:48:46.916 --> 02:48:49.018
APRIL AND IN OCTOBER. AND I'M

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:50.920
GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:48:50.987 --> 02:48:51.955

IN OUR OCTOBER POLL WE HEARD

02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:58.328
THAT AT HALF WAY THROUGH THE

FALL SEMESTER PARENTS ARE NOT

02:49:00.363 --> 02:49:00.997
FINDING DISTANCE LEARNING

02:49:01.064 --> 02:49:03.099
SUCCESSFUL AND THERE ARE CLEAR

02:49:03.166 --> 02:49:04.767
ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE

02:49:04.834 --> 02:49:05.335
ADDRESSED AS THE SCHOOL YEAR

02:49:05.401 --> 02:49:08.771
CONTINUOUS. ONLY 35% OF PARENTS

02:49:08.838 --> 02:49:09.606
RATE DISTANCE LEARNING AS

02:49:09.672 --> 02:49:12.876
SUCCESSFUL COMPARED 257% IN OUR

02:49:12.942 --> 02:49:15.512
APRIL POLL. ADDITIONALLY LOW

02:49:15.578 --> 02:49:17.413
INCOME PARENTS ARE MORE LIKELY

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:18.815
TO RATE DISTANCE LEARNING AS

02:49:18.882 --> 02:49:21.985
UNSUCCESSFUL. STUDENTS FROM LOW

02:49:26.523 --> 02:49:28.625
DISTANCE LEARNING FULL TIME

02:49:28.691 --> 02:49:30.293
FURTHER LOW INCOME PARENTS AND

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:31.861
PARENTS OF COLOR ARE LESS

02:49:31.928 --> 02:49:34.597
LIKELY TO EVEN HAVE THE OPTION

02:49:34.664 --> 02:49:36.666
OF FULL TIME IN PERSON LEARNING

02:49:36.733 --> 02:49:38.468
6% OF LOW INCOME PARENTS REPORT

02:49:38.535 --> 02:49:40.270
THAT THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL IS

02:49:40.336 --> 02:49:41.971
OFFERING IN PERSON FULL TIME

02:49:42.038 --> 02:49:43.806

ACCESS AT 19% PARENTS AROUND

02:49:48.711 --> 02:49:49.979
THE STATE ARE SAYING THAT THE

02:49:50.046 --> 02:49:51.848
DID DIGITAL DIVIDE IS STILL A

02:49:51.915 --> 02:49:55.351
TOP CONCERN. ALMOST HALF 44% OF

02:49:55.418 --> 02:49:57.554
PARENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:49:57.620 --> 02:49:58.855
WHETHER THEIR FAMILY WILL BE

02:49:58.922 --> 02:50:03.593
ABLE TO AFFORD INTERNET ACCESS.

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:05.261
PARENTS ARE REPORTING THAT THE

02:50:05.328 --> 02:50:06.462
PANDEMIC IN DISTANCE LEARNING

02:50:06.529 --> 02:50:08.565
ARE CAUSING HIGHER LEVELS OF

02:50:08.631 --> 02:50:09.232
STRESS FOR THEM AND THEIR

02:50:09.299 --> 02:50:11.701
CHILDREN. SIX IN TEN PARENTS

02:50:11.768 --> 02:50:13.469
SAY THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED.

02:50:13.536 --> 02:50:15.104
ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEIR CHILD

FEEL SAFE EMOTIONALLY AT EASE

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:22.579
DURING THIS TIME. THIS HEARING

02:50:22.645 --> 02:50:24.681
IS COMING AT AN OPPORTUNE TIME

02:50:24.747 --> 02:50:26.215
THE STATE HAS A CRITICAL ROLE

02:50:26.282 --> 02:50:28.017
TO PLAY AND HOW WE TURN THIS

02:50:28.084 --> 02:50:29.819
CRISIS INTO AN OPPORTUNITY. WE

02:50:29.886 --> 02:50:31.588
HAVE REACHED A POINT NEARLY

02:50:31.654 --> 02:50:33.256
EIGHT MONTHS INTO THE PANDEMIC

02:50:33.323 --> 02:50:36.626
WHERE WE MUST BE MORE PROACTIVE

02:50:36.693 --> 02:50:37.226

NUMBER ONE. DIGITAL EQUITY

02:50:51.007 --> 02:50:53.109
REMAINS A CRITICAL ISSUE. THE

TWO HUNDRED OF THEIR MEMBERS.

02:54:08.538 --> 02:54:10.807
OF THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND

02:54:10.873 --> 02:54:13.209
81% OF THEM DID NOT THINK THEY

02:54:13.276 --> 02:54:15.077

SAFE- IF THEY DON'T THINK ALL

02:55:22.678 --> 02:55:24.280
THE SAFETY MEASURES ARE IN

02:55:24.347 --> 02:55:26.949
PLACE AND- AS WAS MENTIONED

02:55:27.016 --> 02:55:30.119
EARLIER. THE NEED FOR TESTING

02:55:30.186 --> 02:55:34.323
SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND- THAT

02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:36.225
THEY THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT

02:55:36.292 --> 02:55:37.460

YOU KNOW I WILL JUST- SAY

02:55:43.966 --> 02:55:45.167
EARLIER YOU HAD SAID THAT WE

02:55:45.234 --> 02:55:46.502
NEED TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES

02:55:46.569 --> 02:55:47.937
WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE

02:55:48.004 --> 02:55:50.239
DETAILS AND- WHILE I AGREE WITH

02:55:50.306 --> 02:55:52.375
THAT- IN PRINCIPLE AND IN THIS

02:55:52.441 --> 02:55:54.944
CASE AS WELL. I WOULD BE

02:55:55.011 --> 02:55:56.779
CONCERNED TOWARDS WHAT TO OUR

02:55:56.846 --> 02:55:58.848
CHAIRWOMAN OF APPROPRIATIONS

DESCRIBED AS A POTENTIAL FOR

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:02.818
THE WILD WEST. I THINK YOU HAVE

02:56:02.885 --> 02:56:03.853
TO LISTEN TO THOSE WHO ARE IN

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:05.554

02:56:10.826 --> 02:56:13.796
PRODUCT AND SO WHILE I HEAR YOU

SAYING THAT TEACHERS DON'T HAVE

02:56:15.598 --> 02:56:17.500
A DIRECT LINE OF INPUT I THINK

02:56:17.566 --> 02:56:18.868
THEY SHOULD. AND I THINK WE

02:56:18.935 --> 02:56:20.803
NEED TO BE INCLUSIVE OF THEIR

02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:22.438
OPINION IN ALL DECISIONS THAT

02:56:22.505 --> 02:56:24.573

CHILDREN AND I. STRONGLY

02:56:27.610 --> 02:56:29.645

02:57:19.028 --> 02:57:20.396
SCHOOL AREN'T RE OPENING WITH

02:57:20.463 --> 02:57:22.164
HAVE ENOUGH TO RIO OR IS THERE

02:57:22.231 --> 02:57:25.134
ARE. A NUMBER OF THESE

02:57:25.201 --> 02:57:27.436
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE FEELING

02:57:27.503 --> 02:57:29.171
MORE AND SAFE TO SEND CHILDREN

02:57:29.238 --> 02:57:48.557
BACK. AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO

02:57:48.624 --> 02:57:51.160

IS RACHEL REFLOW- THANK YOU FOR

02:57:57.066 --> 02:57:58.968
THAT QUESTION I THINK THIS IS

02:57:59.035 --> 02:58:01.070
WHERE THE LACK OF DATA IS

02:58:01.137 --> 02:58:02.772
REALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT

02:58:02.838 --> 02:58:04.907
IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY.

02:58:04.974 --> 02:58:07.309
WHICH FAMILIES ARE- HAVING

02:58:07.376 --> 02:58:08.577
WHICH OPTIONS AND MAKING WHICH

02:58:08.644 --> 02:58:11.047
CHOICES ON A STATEWIDE BASIS

02:58:11.113 --> 02:58:12.214
WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM OUR POLL

02:58:12.281 --> 02:58:14.617
IS THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE

02:58:14.683 --> 02:58:15.718
REPORTING THAT THEY ARE NOT

02:58:15.785 --> 02:58:18.487
HAVING THE OPTION ON THERE. THE

02:58:18.554 --> 02:58:20.423
REPORTING THAT THERE OPTION IS

02:58:20.489 --> 02:58:22.224
AT A MUCH LOWER RATE THAN

02:58:22.291 --> 02:58:24.894
HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES. AND SO

02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:27.129
WE CAN PROBABLY DRIVE FROM THAT

02:58:27.196 --> 02:58:31.734
THAT- COMMUNITIES THAT SERVE-

02:58:31.801 --> 02:58:33.302
SCHOOLS THAT SERVE LOW INCOME

02:58:33.369 --> 02:58:34.837
FAMILIES ARE PERHAPS NOT

02:58:34.904 --> 02:58:36.872
OPENING UP AT THE SAME RATE AS

02:58:36.939 --> 02:58:39.642
MORE A- MORE RESOURCE

02:58:39.708 --> 02:58:41.644
COMMUNITIES I THINK IT WOULD

02:58:41.710 --> 02:58:44.280
ALSO BE IMPORTANT TO COLLECT

02:58:44.346 --> 02:58:46.882
DATA ON. WHEN SCHOOLS ARE

02:58:46.949 --> 02:58:48.384
PROVIDING PARENTS WITH AN

02:58:48.451 --> 02:58:50.486
OPTION TO RETURN TO A HYBRID OR

02:58:50.553 --> 02:58:52.321
IN PERSON AND FAMILIES ARE

02:58:52.388 --> 02:58:53.989
CHOOSING TO STAY IN EXTENDED

02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:55.858
DISTANCE LEARNING WHAT THE

02:58:55.925 --> 02:58:58.060
REASONS ARE FOR THAT DECISION.

02:58:58.127 --> 02:58:58.794
IS IT AN ISSUE OF

02:58:58.861 --> 02:59:00.729
TRANSPORTATION IS THAT AN ISSUE

02:59:00.796 --> 02:59:03.199
OF CHILD CARE BASED ON THE

02:59:03.265 --> 02:59:05.234
HYBRID SCHEDULE IS IT AN ISSUE

02:59:05.301 --> 02:59:07.503
OF CONCERN- FOR HEALTH AND

02:59:07.570 --> 02:59:08.637
SAFETY OF EITHER THE CHILD OR

02:59:08.704 --> 02:59:11.273
FAMILY MEMBERS- THE STATE WILL

02:59:11.340 --> 02:59:12.808
BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEN BE

02:59:12.875 --> 02:59:14.577
ABLE TO ANSWER. THE QUESTION

02:59:14.643 --> 02:59:16.445
THAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WHAT TO

02:59:16.512 --> 02:59:18.814
DO ABOUT IT- AND SO WITHOUT

02:59:18.881 --> 02:59:20.683
THAT DATA IT'S CHALLENGING BUT

02:59:20.749 --> 02:59:22.351
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE DO

02:59:22.418 --> 02:59:24.987
RECOMMEND THAT- DISTRICTS

02:59:25.054 --> 02:59:27.356
COLLECT THIS DATA SO THAT THEY

02:59:27.423 --> 02:59:28.791
CAN MAKE THE APPROPRIATE.

02:59:28.858 --> 02:59:30.659
ACCOMMODATIONS TO SUPPORT ALL

02:59:30.726 --> 02:59:32.461

ACCESS TO HYBRID OR IN PERSON

02:59:35.531 --> 02:59:37.933
LEARNING- AND AT THE STATE

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:39.401
LEVEL RECOMMENDED THAT THERE BE

02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:41.303
SPECIFIC GUIDANCE THAT IS

02:59:41.370 --> 02:59:44.240
REQUIRING LOCALS A LOCAL

SAFETY MEASURES WERE IN PLACE-

03:02:46.689 --> 03:02:49.425
THOUGH IT'S OVER THERE. AT AND

03:02:49.491 --> 03:02:51.860
IT'S A LITTLE I. FOR ME TO BE

03:02:51.927 --> 03:02:56.432
SITTING HERE IN A ROOM- AT THE

03:02:56.498 --> 03:02:59.435
BOTTOM OF THE STATE CAPITOL- BY

03:02:59.501 --> 03:03:01.570

GUARD HERE AND- EVERYONE ELSE-

03:03:05.874 --> 03:03:07.710
DOING THIS VIRTUALLY WITH

03:03:07.776 --> 03:03:10.245
MARATHON YET WE EXPECT OUR

03:03:10.312 --> 03:03:13.449
SCHOOLS TO OPEN UP AND- HAVE

03:03:13.515 --> 03:03:16.218
OUR STUDENTS IN PLACE. AND IT

03:03:16.285 --> 03:03:18.320
IT JUST IS A LITTLE IRONIC THAT

03:03:18.387 --> 03:03:20.889
THAT IS THE CASE I MEAN IF YOU

03:03:20.956 --> 03:03:23.025
CAN'T HAVE ME IN THE SAME ROOM

03:03:23.092 --> 03:03:26.161
WITH THIS WITH YOUR COMMITTEE I

03:03:26.228 --> 03:03:30.299
N. OF FIVE PEOPLE. WHAT HOW WHY

03:03:30.366 --> 03:03:31.767
WOULD IT WHY WOULD YOU THINK

03:03:31.834 --> 03:03:33.936
THAT- YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO

03:03:34.002 --> 03:03:36.705
BRING STUDENTS BACK INTO A

03:03:36.772 --> 03:03:39.508
CLASSROOM SO- HAVING THE

03:03:39.575 --> 03:03:42.277
GUIDELINES- THAT ARE CLEAR AND

03:03:42.344 --> 03:03:45.547
NOT CONSTANTLY CHANGING. WOULD

03:03:45.614 --> 03:03:46.815
BE HELPFUL AND WE UNDERSTAND

03:03:46.882 --> 03:03:49.051
THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS CHANGING

03:03:49.118 --> 03:03:52.020
RAPIDLY BUT IT'S MAKES IT VERY

03:03:52.087 --> 03:03:54.189
DIFFICULT TO MAKE PLANS UNDER

03:03:54.256 --> 03:03:56.024
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVING

03:03:56.091 --> 03:03:57.626
TESTING AVAILABLE SO PEOPLE

03:03:57.693 --> 03:04:00.295
FEEL CONFIDENT. THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:04:00.362 --> 03:04:02.097
COMING INTO THE SCHOOLS AND

03:04:02.164 --> 03:04:07.403
THEY'RE SAFE- WOULD BE HELPFUL.

03:04:07.469 --> 03:04:10.072
ANDPROVIDING ALL OF THE-

03:04:10.139 --> 03:04:11.540
FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:14.510
SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE ALL.

03:04:14.576 --> 03:04:16.612
CLEAN AND WE HAVE ALL THE

03:04:16.678 --> 03:04:18.847
PROPER PP THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE

03:04:18.914 --> 03:04:22.451
HELPFUL. OKAY THANK YOU SO YOU

03:04:22.518 --> 03:04:24.853
ARE OF COURSE A DISTRICT OF

03:04:24.920 --> 03:04:25.487
FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THERE

03:04:25.554 --> 03:04:27.289
ARE SIX MILLION FORTY THOUSAND

03:04:27.356 --> 03:04:28.624

03:04:28.690 --> 03:04:30.859
KIDS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND

03:04:30.926 --> 03:04:32.361
SO THAT THE SNAPSHOT OF A

03:04:32.428 --> 03:04:34.730
LARGER LARGER SNAPSHOT. SO YOUR

03:04:34.797 --> 03:04:38.133

OF JANUARY AND THE I GUESS THE

03:04:43.105 --> 03:04:44.306
BOARD VOTED ON AND I ASSUME

03:04:44.373 --> 03:04:46.275
THAT THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

03:04:46.341 --> 03:04:48.076
WAS PART OF THAT EQUATION SO

03:04:48.143 --> 03:04:50.012
WHAT ARE YOU DOING A YEAR

03:04:50.078 --> 03:04:52.281
DISTRICT AS FAR AS A TESTING

03:04:52.347 --> 03:04:56.251

MEMBER BE TESTED EVERY WEEK.

03:05:16.104 --> 03:05:18.540
WHICH WOULD MEAN ABOUT SIX

03:05:18.607 --> 03:05:20.776
HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE A WEEK

03:05:20.843 --> 03:05:22.611
WOULD BE TESTED. I DON'T

03:05:22.678 --> 03:05:24.279
BELIEVE RIGHT NOW THE DISTRICT

03:05:24.346 --> 03:05:26.381
HAS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY TESTS

03:05:26.448 --> 03:05:29.685
