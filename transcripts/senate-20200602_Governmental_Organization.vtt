ISN'T FOR A FUN EASY ISSUE

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:19.292
EITHER. THE REASONS ARE SIMPLE.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.960

HALF THE LEGALIZE SPORTS

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:39.445
WAGERING. NEARLY HALF OF THE

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.247
NATION EXCUSE ME HAS LEGALIZED

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.149
SPORTS WAGERING AND WE SHOULD

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:44.283
DO IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN A

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.320
WAY THAT MAXIMIZES BENEFITS TO

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.622
THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. WHEN I

BECAME CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:53.459
THREE YEARS AGO. I SUDDENLY

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.061
FOUND MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.096
VERY FRACTURED RELATIONSHIP

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.431
THAT HAS EXISTED BETWEEN CARD

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:01.300

WAS TIME TO TRY TO WORK

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.411
TOGETHER ON A SOLUTION. I

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.312
BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATION OF

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.648
SPORTS WAGERING PROVIDES THE

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:16.949
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THE

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.851

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:24.257

ECONOMIC TIMES. I KNOW THERE

ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES WHO'LL

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:32.732
NEVER AGREE TO A SOLUTION. BUT

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.333
I HOPE THAT IF YOU TAKE A

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.868
MOMENT TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.837
THIS BILL IS. UNDERSTANDING

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.305

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:44.010
SAME CONCLUSION THAT I HAVE.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:48.381
THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD. INACTION

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.582

FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.523
TRACKS BENEFIT AS THEY WOULD BE

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.425
ABLE TO OFFER SPORTS WAGERING

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.960
IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:30.396
INITIATIVE. ORIGINALLY AUTHORED

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:32.531
BY SOME TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. IN

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:33.866

HORSE RACING WHICH EXISTS TODAY.

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:40.205

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:43.375
MEASURE. THAT WAS INCLUDED IN

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:47.179
THE TRIBAL EDITION. THAT IS A

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:48.514
PROVISION CREATING A PRIVATE

RIGHT OF ACTION. WHICH IS A

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.885
TOOL TO DISRUPT IF NOT TOTALLY

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:54.887
DESTROYED CALIFORNIA'S LICENSE

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:58.724

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.292
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REAL

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:01.660

WE KNOW THEM TODAY. THREE THE

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:17.176
STATE WILL REALIZE HUNDREDS OF

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.811
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN GREATLY

00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:21.146

GIVES THE CAR CLUBS A

00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.261
SUBSTANTIAL EXPANSION OF

THEY CURRENTLY ARE AUTHORIZED

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:45.237

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.446
LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME. I

AM IN MY SECOND YEAR IN SENATE

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:49.551
BUT EVEN THOUGH THIS ISSUE HAS

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:50.652
CERTAINLY BEEN AROUND FOR

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.821
DECADES I HADN'T HAD OCCASION

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:55.023
TO FULLY APPRECIATE- THE

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:57.292
POSITIONS IN THE ARGUMENTS AND

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.860
THE FACTS AND HISTORY OF THIS

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:01.396
MATTER. BUT THINGS THAT I'VE

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.832
LOOKED ARE THAT. DRIVE IN CARD

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.600
ROOMS ARE CERTAINLY IN A

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:07.969
PROTRACTED BATTLE. I THINK THAT

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:09.905
IS THAT IS PRETTY PRETTY CLEAR

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.107
HERE. THAT THERE ARE TWO

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:16.578
LAWSUITS ARE UNDER WAY- THAT WE

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:19.514
HAVE NOT HEARD. OF THE OF THE

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:23.652
COURTS- RENDERING DECISIONS YET.

01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:26.221
WHAT ALSO IS THAT WE'VE HAD

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:28.523
THREE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S- WHO

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.192
HAVE HAD JURISDICTION ON SOME

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:32.827
OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:34.930
PROVIDED ENOUGH CLARITY TO

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.965
RESOLVE SO THE MOST OUTSTANDING

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:39.401
THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED NOW AS

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:42.337
AN ATTORNEY- I WOULD LIKE TO GO

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.773
TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:47.075
THESE ISSUES AND I ALSO RELY

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:52.681
ON- FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE LITTLE

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:53.682
DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE. I WANT

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:55.550
THINGS THAT A LOT YEAR WAS POSE

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:56.985
A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS TO LEAD

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.087
COUNSEL. SPECIFICALLY TRY TO

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:01.156
UNDERSTAND. DOES THE

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:04.759
EXCLUSIVITY OF EXIST. DO CARD

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:07.295
ROOMS PRACTICE IN ENGAGING

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.464
GAMES THAT ARE IN VIOLATION OF

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:12.500
A CONTACT A NUMBER OF OTHERS.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:14.536
WHAT I WAS SURPRISED IS THAT I

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:18.607
GOT ZERO RESPONSE FROM OUR

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:21.176
LEGAL ADVISERS IN THE WRIST IN

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:22.744
THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:27.449
RESPONSE IT WAS EXPLAINED. IT

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:29.784
WAS EXPLAINED AWAY. THAT

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.786
BECAUSE THIS MATTER WAS IN

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:33.521
LITIGATION THAT THEY WOULD NOT-

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:35.557
PINE OR PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.259
IT NOW FROM A LEGISLATOR

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:39.728
STANDPOINT I THINK THAT IS

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.596
ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. THAT

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.965
IF WE ARE REALLY GOING ON

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:46.735
UNDERSTANDING AN ISSUE AND EVEN

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:48.703
IF ONE IS CURRENTLY IN THE

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.605
MIDST OF LITIGATION THAT WE

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.274
SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO GET

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:56.011
ANSWERS OF MARLEY BERMAN SO

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.279
THAT'S A PERSONAL GRIEVANCE ON

01:21:57.345 --> 01:22:00.348
ON. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THIS IS

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:04.519
A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN POLICY.

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:06.521
ONE THAT I BELIEVE DESERVES A

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:09.624
LOT OF EXAMINATION IN A LOT OF

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:14.095
EXPLANATION AND A LOT OF- BOXES

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.697
GETTING CHECKED ON THE DUE

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.965
DILIGENCE THAT WOULD NORMALLY

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:21.936
BE EXPECTED IN A- ISSUE THIS. I

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:24.139
GOT THE BILL ANALYSIS YESTERDAY

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:27.008
EVENING. I'M STILL I'M

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.143
SCRATCHING MY HEAD HERE I'M

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.444
JUST I'M ADDING UP THE

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:33.548
CHALLENGES NO I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.115
COVERT IS CHANGED VIRTUALLY

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:35.583
EVERYTHING THE FACT THAT THERE

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:38.286
WERE. WEARING MASKS IN IN A

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:40.422
PORTION OF US ARE IN THIS ROOM-

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:42.357
AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE STAFFER IN

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:44.693
EACH OF OUR OFFICES EVERYTHING

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:46.995
BEING DONE REMOTELY AND

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:50.932
PROTESTERS FOR TWO NIGHTS IN A

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:54.736
ROW AND HAVE BEEN- MAKING SURE.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.037
OF THAT. I UNDERSTAND. THINGS

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:59.274
WE'RE- BUT IT DOESN'T OBVIATE

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:01.776
THE NEED TO GET INFORMATION IN

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:04.045
A TIMELY FASHION SO THAT WE CAN

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:07.282
MAKE INFORMED- JUDGMENTS ON OR

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:08.616
AT LEAST ALLOW US TO GET FOLLOW

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:12.020
UP- EIGHT THREE SATISFIED. I

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.856
HAPPEN TO BE AN ALL IN. I

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:15.423
HAPPEN TO BE OF THE OPINION

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:17.826
THAT. NGUYEN REASONABLE ALL

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:20.261
COME TOGETHER EVEN IF THEY ARE

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.731
STAUNCHLY PROTECTING THEIR

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:25.967
JURISDICTION THEIR TERRITORY OR

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:29.037
THEIR REVENUE SOURCE. THAT

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:31.840
THERE IS A SOLUTION TO BE HAVE.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.475
IT BAFFLES ME TO THINK THAT WE

01:23:33.541 --> 01:23:36.010
CANNOT FIND A WAY FOR THESE

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:39.280
PARTIES TO COME TOGETHER

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:40.081
WHETHER IT BE IN A REVENUE

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.950
SHARING AGREEMENT FOR BETTER

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:43.685
MORE LIKE FULL UNDERSTANDING OF

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.520
WHERE THE PARTIES CAN OPERATE

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.889
FREELY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:50.992
THAT HAPPEN. NOW WHAT I'VE BEEN

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.560
TOLD BY CERTAIN FOLKS IN THIS

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:55.230
GOES BACK TO THE HE SAID SHE

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:57.098
SAID EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE EXT-

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:58.633
THAT I'VE HAD ON THIS ISSUE IT

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.103
THAT. NO THIS CONTACTED- SOME

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:04.072
OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEY'VE

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:05.673
NEVER HAD A SEAT AT THE TABLE

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.408
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT'S

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:07.942
THE- AND OTHERS ARE STAYING

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:09.844
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY PATENTLY

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:13.047
FALSE. WHO DO I BELIEVE I MEAN

01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:16.618
THIS IS LITERALLY THE IT IS

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:19.521
SHOWERED IN A GRAY ZONE OF

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:21.956
MISINFORMATION FALSE NARRATIVES

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:23.625
AND FALSE CHOICES FOR THAT

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:29.197
MATTER. I BELIEVE THE PARTIES

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:31.466
NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE TO

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:33.301
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. AND I

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:34.602
UNDERSTAND THAT GIVEN CODE

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:35.870
WITHIN THE PROTESTS IN THE

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:38.106
TIMELINE OF BRINGING A BALLOT

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:40.608
ISSUE FOR TO FORWARD HAS LEFT

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.544
US WITH LITTLE ROOM TO

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:46.047
NEGOTIATE AND MANEUVER. EVEN IF

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.849
AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.218
APPROVE IT SO WE CAN BEGIN

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:51.719
NEGOTIATING THAT'S NOT REALLY

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:53.188
MY STYLE AND I DON'T THINK

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:54.122
THAT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE AND

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:55.990
THE SOPHISTICATION THE BODY OF

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:57.892
THE ISSUE. BUT SHOULD THIS

01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:59.327
BEFORE TO STAY IN SPEC INSPECT

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:02.564
IT WILL. ONE ONE OR TWO THINGS

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:05.099
THAT CAN MAKE THIS BETTER. IS

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:08.536
THAT WE REFINE THE FARM THAT

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.238
THE FUNDING FOR BECAUSE RIGHT

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:11.806
NOW IT'S GOING TO GO INTO A

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:14.976
GENERAL FUND A WELFARE FUND- TO

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:16.845
BE GONE AFTER BY A VARIETY OF

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:19.347
FOLKS AS THE SEARCH COMING IN.

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:20.982
I THINK WE'LL BE BETTER SERVED

01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:24.185
IF WE FORCE AND ARTICULATION OF

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:27.388
WHAT OR THE OR THE RECIPIENT

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:30.758
AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. CATION

01:25:30.825 --> 01:25:33.461
HIGHER IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:36.431
SERVICES I BELIEVE THAT IT

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:37.565
WOULD BE BETTER AND MORE

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:39.467
BENEFICIAL TO CALIFORNIANS IF

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:40.702
WE KNEW WHERE THIS FUN MONEY

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:42.971
WAS GOING TO GO AND LET'S NOT

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:44.405
KID OURSELVES WE TALK ABOUT

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:47.509
KOBE NINETEEN- YOU KNOW IT

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:49.711
SHOWING US THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:53.481
BE IN IN THE RED FOR A

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.917
SIGNIFICANT TIME AHEAD. THE

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:56.451
ESTIMATIONS OF FOR HUNDRED

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:59.287
MILLION. IS THE FACT THAT WERE

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:01.322
FIFTY FOUR BILLION IN THE RED

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:03.258
SO CAN THIS BE HELPFUL YES.

01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:04.759
WILL THIS CHANGE OUR ECONOMIC

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:07.862
OUTLOOK. PROBABLY NOT THIS IS

01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:10.465
ONE OF MANY SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS

01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:11.065
A WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:13.768
AS A BODY ON WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.637
VERSES ARE WANTS WHAT OUR

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:18.006
PRIORITIES AS CALIFORNIA

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:20.909
LEGISLATORS- IT. ALSO WE MOVE

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:24.078
FORWARD AS A STATE ALL. MY

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:26.080
CONCERN IS THAT IS THIS MOVES

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:28.249
FORWARD WE TALKED ABOUT MAKING

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:31.219
THIS ACTIVATED IN JANUARY OF

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:32.086
TWENTY TWENTY WITH ALL THE

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.521
REGULATIONS- THAT WOULD GO

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:35.023
ALONG BEHIND IT PROBABLY

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.190
LOOKING AT ANOTHER YEAR THERE

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:41.596
AFTER. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.565
TRIBES ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:45.567
TO COURT IN THIS WILL BE STUCK

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:47.869
IN LITIGATION FOR SIGNIFICANT

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:50.338
PERIOD OF TIME. SO ONE OF

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:51.639
COMBINATIONS THAT I WOULD HAVE

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.441
IS THAT IF THIS DOESN'T PASS

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:55.877
FORWARD TODAY OR DOES IT PASSED

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:57.545
THE SENATE WERE THE ENTIRE

01:26:57.612 --> 01:26:59.547
PROCESS. THAT WE IMMEDIATELY

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:02.317
READMISSION EIGHT. A FULL IN

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:04.285
COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION WITH

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:06.454
THE STAKEHOLDERS SO NO ONE CAN

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:08.022
EVER SAY THAT THEY WEREN'T AT

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:12.827
THE TABLE. ALSO THIS IDEA THAT

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:15.496
THAT THE ONLINE GAMING. IS NOT

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:17.665
GOING TO COME TO CALIFORNIA I

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:22.870
THINK. I THINK IT WILL BE

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:24.272
COMING TO CALIFORNIA WHETHER

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:27.141
IT'S TODAY OR OR A YEAR FROM

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.444
NOW. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.045
BECAUSE IT IS VIRTUALLY

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:33.948
INEVITABLE. NOW HOW WE GO ABOUT

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:35.049
CREATING A REVENUE SHARING

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:36.584
AGREEMENT THAT LOOKS AFTER THE

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:38.786
INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:41.222
AS THE EXISTING STAKEHOLDERS-

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.590
SOME OF WHICH HAD MAYBE

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:44.792
INVESTED IN MAJOR CAPITAL

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:46.594
EXPANSION INFRASTRUCTURES. WITH

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:49.197
THE EXPECTATION OF REVENUES

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:52.233
BEING ON A MORE EXCLUSIVE BASIS.

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.736

01:42:56.370 --> 01:43:00.007
GET TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND. A

01:43:00.073 --> 01:43:02.109
LEADERSHIP IT'S THERE TODAY BUT

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:05.045
MOST IMPORTANTLY THE HISTORY

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.880
THE HISTORY OF THE INDIANS.

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:09.182
HERE IN OUR STATE. AND IT'S AN

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:12.452
UGLY HISTORY. NOW I KNOW THAT'S

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:13.921
NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE ISSUE

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:15.656
BEFORE US TODAY BUT IT'S WORTH

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.224
AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:21.028
UPON. THAT HISTORY AND IT COMES

01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:22.429
AT A TIME WHERE WE HAVE OUR OWN

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:24.665
PANDEMIC BUT FOR THE NATIVE

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:27.568
AMERICAN COMMUNITY DISEASE

01:43:27.634 --> 01:43:29.603
BROUGHT IN FROM THE OUTSIDE WAS

01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:31.939
IS CERTAINLY A KILLER OF.

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:35.742
THOUSANDS THEY HAD WARS THEY

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:38.478
HAD MASSACRES MASSACRES BY THE

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:40.480
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LED BY

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:43.317
LEADERS OF OUR STATE. PUT OUT

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:46.687
BOUNTIES. BUT THE SCALLOPS OF

01:43:46.753 --> 01:43:48.855
INDIANS PART OF OUR UGLY

01:43:48.922 --> 01:43:52.459
HISTORY AS A STATE. AND THEN OF

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:52.960
COURSE THEY WERE PUT ON

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:56.797
RESERVATIONS. AND THEN NOT TOO

01:43:56.863 --> 01:43:59.299
FAR AFTER THAT THEY WERE KICKED

01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:02.703
OFF RESERVATIONS. AND FINALLY

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:04.204
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:07.874
CENTURY. THEY WERE TOLD TO

01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:09.376
REESTABLISH RESERVATIONS TO

01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:11.745
JUSTIFY RESERVATIONS AND WHERE

01:44:11.812 --> 01:44:13.747
DID THEY PUT THEM. THEY PUT

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.849
THEM IN THE UNDESIRABLE PARTS

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:18.285
OF OUR STATE. NEXT THE GARBAGE

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:22.723
STOPS. FAR AWAY FROM CITIES ON

01:44:22.789 --> 01:44:24.658
LAND THAT WAS SO DESOLATE HE

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:26.126
COULDN'T EVEN GROW CROPS THAT'S

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:27.894
WHAT WE DID. THAT'S WHAT OUR

01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:31.365
GOVERNMENT DID. AND ALL THE

01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:33.533
RECEIPT WAS PALTRY HELP. FROM

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.902
OUR FEDERAL LEADERS ANIMALS

01:44:35.969 --> 01:44:37.971
NOTHING FROM THE STATE AND SO

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:40.741
WHAT HAPPENED. DOOR INDIAN

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:42.743
BROTHERS AND SISTERS. MASSIVE

01:44:42.809 --> 01:44:49.816
POVERTY. MASSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:44:49.883 --> 01:44:56.056
NOW IN THE. END OF THE LAST

01:44:56.123 --> 01:45:00.427
CENTURY. NAY START ENTERPRISES

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:02.929
ON THEIR LAND. GAMING

01:45:02.996 --> 01:45:04.831
ENTERPRISES OF COURSE WHAT

01:45:04.898 --> 01:45:09.469
HAPPENED. FEDERAL RAIDS FEDERAL

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:12.806
PROSECUTION ACCUSATIONS THAT

01:45:12.873 --> 01:45:15.642
THEY WERE ACTING ILLEGALLY.

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:16.209
TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING ON

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:19.079
THEIR LAND AND THEY FACED

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:21.481
ANOTHER. PERSECUTE FORM OF

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:24.151
PERSECUTION. ATTACK THAT THEIR

01:45:24.217 --> 01:45:25.986
GAMES WERE LEGAL UNDER THE

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:29.289
STATE CONSTITUTION. I HAD THE

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:30.424
OPPORTUNITY IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:32.659
EIGHT. TO WORK WITH THEM

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:35.128
INTIMATELY ON THIS PROBLEM. AND

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:37.964
WAS PLEASED TO JOIN WITH THEM

01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:39.833
IN PUTTING FORTH TO THE PEOPLE

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:42.969
OF CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION FIVE

01:45:43.036 --> 01:45:46.673
TO LEGALIZE THOSE GAMES.

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:49.109
BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL CHALLENGES

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:51.344
AFTER THE PASSAGE THAT MEASURE.

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:52.713
THEY HAD TO COME BACK TWO YEARS

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:54.514
LATER FOR PROPOSITION ONE A THE

01:45:54.581 --> 01:45:57.217
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SETTLED

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:58.785
THIS DISPUTE FIND GAINES. WE

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:04.758
THOUGHT. AND THAT SETTLEMENT

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:09.096
ALLOWED THE TRIBES. TO BEGIN TO

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:09.663
CREATE PROSPERITY FOR THEIR

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:13.200
MEMBERS. NOT FOR ALL TRIBES FOR

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:15.602
MANY TRIBES IN THE STATE OVER A

01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:17.938
HUNDRED MANY OF THEM DON'T EVEN

01:46:18.004 --> 01:46:18.505
HAVE THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF

01:46:18.572 --> 01:46:20.073
GAMING TO IMPROVE THEIR

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:22.209
SITUATION. SO I HAVE THE

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.877
SPECIAL APPRECIATION FOR THIS

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:25.679
HISTORY AND I KNOW IT'S NOT

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:28.281
BEFORE US BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:30.117
THAT IT BE SAID ON THIS FLOOR.

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.551
THERE ARE TWO KEY ISSUES WHEN I

01:46:31.618 --> 01:46:32.919
LOOK AT LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE

01:46:32.986 --> 01:46:34.955
FACING TODAY. THAT ARE MOST

01:46:35.021 --> 01:46:39.793
IMPORTANT TO ME. NUMBER ONE IT

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.827
PROTECTS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE

01:46:40.894 --> 01:46:43.864
TRIBES THEIR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS

01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.599
AS AT THE SAME AS CALIFORNIA

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:47.234
THEY DESERVE TO BE DEALT WITH

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.668
RESERVE WITH RESPECT. AND

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:50.170
NOTHING THAT WE SHOULD DO

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.772
SHOULD UNDERCUT. THAT ISSUE OF

01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:55.275
SOVEREIGNTY. AND THE SECOND

01:46:55.342 --> 01:46:57.144
STANDARD THAT I USE IN

01:46:57.210 --> 01:46:57.711
EVALUATING BILLS LIKE THIS

01:46:57.778 --> 01:46:59.780
TODAY IF THEIR ECONOMIC

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:02.616
SECURITY. WHAT PROP FIVE IN

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:05.152
PROP ONE EIGHT DID WAS GIVE

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:07.454
MANY OF THEM NOT ALL SOME LEVEL

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:09.189
OF ECONOMIC SECURITY BY

01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:11.858
CREATING A FRANCHISE OF GAMING.

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:13.527
BUT COULDN'T BE REPLICATED IN

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.595
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE SO

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:17.631
THEY COULD PROSPER. AND THEY

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:20.534
HAVE PROSPERED. AND SO WHEN I

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.869
LOOK AT LEGISLATION. THAT WE

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:24.171
HAVE TODAY THOSE TWO OR THAT

01:47:24.237 --> 01:47:26.006
THE TWO STANDARDS THAT I

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:30.143
EXAMINE CAREFULLY. AND WHEN I

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:32.746
LOOK AT THIS BILL. I DON'T

01:47:32.813 --> 01:47:34.281
THINK IT PROTECTS THE FRANCHISE

01:47:34.347 --> 01:47:38.318
OF THE TRIBE. I THINK THAT IT

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:39.519
ALLOWS FOR AN EXPANSION THAT

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:40.854
CAN POTENTIALLY ROAD THE

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:42.389
ECONOMIC SECURITY. OF THE

01:47:42.455 --> 01:47:44.658
TRIBES. AND THAT TROUBLES ME

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:47.894
GREATLY. NOW IT DOES NOT MEAN

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:49.563
THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:51.765
CARD ROOMS OR THE RACE TRACKS I

01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:53.834
HAVE CARD ROOMS IN MY DISTRICT

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.535
I HAVE A RACETRACK IN MY

01:47:55.602 --> 01:47:59.039
DISTRICT. I AM SENSITIVE TO THE

01:47:59.105 --> 01:48:00.373
IMPORTANT ECONOMIC

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.241
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THOSE

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:02.943
ENTERPRISES HAVE IN THEIR LOCAL

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:05.345
COMMUNITIES. I AM SENSITIVE TO

01:48:05.412 --> 01:48:06.780
THE JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED

01:48:06.847 --> 01:48:10.050
GOOD JOBS. AND WHAT THAT MEANS

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:10.517
FOR MANY PEOPLE IN OUR

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:19.593
COMMUNITIES. BUT WHEN I LOOK AT

01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:20.126
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:25.465
BEFORE US. IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:27.601
IT DOES NOT PROTECT THE

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:30.170
ECONOMIC SECURITY OF THE TRIBES.

01:48:30.237 --> 01:48:32.105
THE INTERNET THE EXPANSION OF

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:32.973
GAMING ON THE INTERNET THROUGH

01:48:33.039 --> 01:48:34.341
SPORTS BETTING HAS THE

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:35.976
POTENTIAL TO A ROAD THAT

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:38.778
FRANCHISE. AND IT- AS I SAID

01:48:38.845 --> 01:48:40.914
TROUBLES ME I DO BELIEVE I

01:48:40.981 --> 01:48:42.048
THINK THE SENATOR FROM THE

01:48:42.115 --> 01:48:43.550
CENTRAL VALLEY SAID IT'S

01:48:43.617 --> 01:48:44.951
EARLIER I DO BELIEVE THERE CAN

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:47.554
BE A COMPROMISE HERE. THAT

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:49.789
PROVIDES FOR SECURITY. THE CARD

01:48:49.856 --> 01:48:51.825
CLUBS IN THE RACETRACKS BUT

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:52.926
DOES IN A ROW THE ECONOMIC

01:48:52.993 --> 01:48:55.528
SECURITY. OF THE TRIBES AND

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:58.064
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

01:48:58.131 --> 01:49:00.200
AND I CERTAINLY. SHARE THE

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:00.800
SENTIMENTS THAT FULL

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:03.870
CONSULTATION. IS A REQUIREMENT.

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:05.639
SO FOR ME THIS BILL DOESN'T

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:07.007
STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE I

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:08.842
STILL RESPECT THE AUTHOR I

01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:11.278
EXPECT RESPECT HIS LEADERSHIP I

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:12.712
THINK HE CAN GET US TO A BETTER

01:49:12.779 --> 01:49:14.180
PLACE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:16.049
BILL BEFORE US. IS NOT THAT

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:26.893
PLACE. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER.

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.097
I SEE NO OTHER MIKE'S UP SO.

01:49:31.164 --> 01:49:32.799
CALL CENTER ARCHULETA I'M SORRY.

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:35.468
YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU
