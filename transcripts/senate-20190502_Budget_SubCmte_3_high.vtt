MORE INCLUSIVE OF THEIR SERVICES.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.107
AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:56.976
ALIGNMENT THE AGING AND

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:59.412
DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTERS --

SO YOU ASKED US TO BRIEFLY SPEAK

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:11.123
TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.491
I'M GETTING PEOPLE WITH

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.293
DISABILITIES EMPLOYED WHILE WE

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.761
COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF THE

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:18.097
FACT THAT WE TRULY FOCUS ON

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.498
LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND.

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.567
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE RECOGNIZE

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.269
THAT TODAY WE'RE SERVING

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.103
INDIVIDUALS WITH MOST

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.005
SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES AND IN

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:28.474
MANY CASES MULTIPLE DISABILITIES

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.343
COULD BE SENSORY LOSS

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.478
DEVELOPMENTAL -- ANY NUMBER OF

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.446
COMBINATIONS ONE OF THE

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:35.214
CHALLENGES THAT WE CONTINUE TO

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:37.316
WORK ON IS THAT FOR STALLING

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.685
THAT INDIVIDUALS READINESS FOR

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:40.586
EMPLOYMENT.

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:41.854
IT'S REALLY HAVEN'T LIVED A LIFE

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.990
OF LITTLE OR NO EXPECTATION THAT

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.224
EMPLOYMENT WOULD BE A REALITY.

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.826
AND SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.661
ALL SYSTEMS AND ALL PARTNERS TO

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.162
CHANGE THAT.

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:56.903
WHY THAT'S AN ISSUE IS BECAUSE

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.704
OFTEN?

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.740
WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL COMES TO US

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.643
FOR SERVICES IT'S THE?

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:04.944
IT'S NOT THE FIRST BUT IT'S VERY

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:05.745
CLOSE TO THE FIRST TIME THAT THE

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:06.779
REALLY ENGAGING IN THAT

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.214
CONVERSATION THAT SAYS WORK AS

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.850
POSSIBLE AND THEN OF COURSE THAT

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:11.384
SKILL DEVELOPMENT IS THEN

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:11.684
BEGINNING.

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:12.318
THERE WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT TOO

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.819
LATE FOR US SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.221
WORK WITH THAT.

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.822
THE OTHER THING THAT'S WHICH

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:17.590
WILL CONTAIN ONLY CHALLENGED

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:18.858
WITH IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:19.926
DISABILITIES OFTEN DON'T START

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.260
AT THE SAME PLACES THEIR NON

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:21.894
DISABLED COUNTERPARTS.

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.396
IN THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:24.931
TO THEM CERTAINLY ARE THE SAME

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:27.099
SO THEIR PATH AND THE LENGTH OF

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.034
TIME THAT IT TAKES A TRAVEL THAT

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.902
PATH CAN BE DIFFERENT SO PART OF

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:31.137
WHAT WE DO.

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:33.239
IS THAT WHOLE SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:36.776
THAT WILL HELP -- TO CHANGE SOME

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.277
OF THOSE REALITIES.

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:39.145
SO FOR SOME CONTEXT THE

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.046
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WITH PEOPLE

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.814
WITH DISABILITIES CONTINUES TO

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.783
PERSISTENTLY BE IN THE

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.052
NEIGHBORHOOD OF 70%.

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:47.920
BUSINESS IS BEING OPEN TO AND

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:49.789
HIRING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES --

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:52.058
IS ANOTHER AREA THAT WE CONTINUE

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:54.293
TO BE CHALLENGED AND PART OF

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.262
THAT -- IS RECOGNIZING THAT A

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.064
BUSINESS REALLY IS ANYONE THAT

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.732
MAKES A HIGHER WHETHER IT BE A

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:02.501
GOVERNMENT FOR PROFIT FOR PROFIT

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:04.370
NONPROFIT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.071
ANYBODY THAT REALLY MAKES A

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:06.505
HIGHER.

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.507
SO ADDRESSING.

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:10.142
FROM THEIR FEARS AND CONCERNS IS

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.011
PARAMOUNT -- AND WHAT SOME OF

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:13.713
THOSE FEARS AND CONCERNS CAN BE --

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.181
YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE RISK HOW AM

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:16.983
I GOING TO ACCOMMODATE WHAT IF

YOU KNOW ANY NUMBER OF TYPES OF

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.685
THINGS LIKE THAT MEDIC IT'S

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.153
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.355
WHILE TO DATE.

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:23.622
WE SEE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.524
AND SOCIETY MUCH MORE THAN EVER

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.960
BEFORE ENTERTAINMENT IT CETERA.

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.363
WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO WHERE

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:31.497
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:34.133
SEEN AS HAVING THE SAME TALENT

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.569
IN THE SAME POTENTIAL AND GIVEN

00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:38.671
THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES SO -- IN

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:40.439
TERMS OF A CHALLENGE THAT'S AN

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:41.640
AREA THAT WE FACE SYSTEMS

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:43.476
ALIGNMENT AS I MENTIONED WE'RE

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:46.946
WORKING ON IT.

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:49.415
IT STILL HAS IN THE CHI.

WELL -- YOU KNOW THE THE WHAT IT

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:56.989
AT THEM.

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.557

AND 10% IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:04.770
ADJUSTMENT GIVEN THE RATES OF

INCREASES NEED TO BE MADE WE'LL

00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:16.448

WITHIN OUR BUDGET.

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:37.929
BUT WE PLAN TO UTILISE THIS

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:39.097
MONEY EFFECTIVELY CONSISTENT

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:41.233
WITH THE LAW [inaudible]

SONYA PECK ELIO.

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:50.542
WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT --

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.944
THE THE MINIMUM WAGE COMPONENT

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.479

A INCREASED OTHERWISE FOR QUITE

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.255
SOME TIME -- AS HAS ALREADY BEEN

00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:05.190
DISCUSSED THE 10% DOESN'T HAVE A

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:08.160
PARTICULARLY ANALYTIC BASIS AT

00:22:08.226 --> 00:22:10.262
THIS POINT WE WE RECOGNIZE --

MONITOR THE EFFECT OF THAT

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:27.713
INCREASE ON SAY THE NUMBER OF

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:30.716
PROVIDERS BUT WE JUST ENCOURAGE.

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:31.349
THE YOU KNOW TO CONTINUING TO

LOOK AT THOSE TYPES OF METRICS

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.820
TO HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF HOW MUCH.

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:36.521
OF RATE INCREASES IN THE FUTURE

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:40.926
NEED TO BE.

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:42.127
ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:44.029
FINANCE ON THIS OKAY QUESTIONS

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:47.866
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:50.102
SO I GUESS FROM.

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:51.803
THE MONITORING AND SO FORTH AND

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.005
I APPRECIATE THE FUNDING FOR AN

00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:58.110
INCREASE I THINK -- YELL

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:58.410
[inaudible]

00:22:58.477 --> 00:22:58.910
YES [inaudible]

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:00.245
WELL.

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:01.513
IN TERMS OF BECAUSE I THINK

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.216
PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE

00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:07.052
BASICALLY THERE WAS A THEY

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:08.053
LOOKED AT THE COST RIGHT

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.521
SERVICES RIGHT.

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:11.389
AND THEN THERE ON RECESSION HIT

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:13.325
WE SORT OF FLATTENED EVERYBODY

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.127
SO THE PROCESS SO I MEAN I GUESS-OF THE GOOD AND THERE ARE SOME

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:17.362
PEOPLE WHO THE COSTS WERE LASSEN

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:18.330
THEY GOT MOVED UP TO AN AVERAGE

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.732
AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE GOT MOVED

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.400
TO REGULAR AND THEN.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:23.401
DOWN RIGHT.

00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:25.570
AND SO WERE STILL PRESERVING

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:31.710
THAT STRUCTURE IN MANY WAYS AND

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:32.544
I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT IS SO ARE

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.546
WE AND I PRETTY SAID YOU'RE

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:35.313
MONITORING I MEAN.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.083
THIS IS BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.351
NINE I GUESS I'M.

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:40.452
D. E. ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT I

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:42.187
MEAN THE PEOPLE WHO PREVIOUSLY

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.055
E. L. WHO TOOK THIS ACTUALLY

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:46.158
MORE OF A CUT I MEAN A DAISY.

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:47.058
WE WERE NOT SEEN DISPROPORTIONAL

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.360
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THEM BILL

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:51.229
PROVIDE THE SERVICES - EVEN NOW

00:23:51.296 --> 00:23:52.731
I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS NOW TEN

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.332
YEARS LATER SO IT'S SO WE CAN

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:56.168
SAVE MONEY TO FUTURE BUT IN

00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:57.903
TERMS OF WE'RE DOING A 10%

00:23:57.969 --> 00:24:01.173
ACROSS THE BOARD THAT'S GREAT --

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:02.541
BUT I MEAN RIGHT NOW SO YOU'RE

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:04.843
SAYING THAT SINCE WE DID TWO

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:05.410
THOUSAND NINE WE'RE NOT TOO

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:06.945
CONCERNED THAT WE FLATTEN IT OUT

00:24:07.012 --> 00:24:07.412
THE DOES ANY.

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:13.451
SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT.

00:24:13.518 --> 00:24:16.321
YEAH SALAMI START THAT OCCURRED

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:17.956
SENATOR SO -- AIDID.

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:20.058
GOOD OBSERVATIONS -- APPRECIATE

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.060
THOSE I THINK ONE THING THAT'S

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:22.794
WHICH CERTAINLY -- TRY TO KEEP

00:24:22.861 --> 00:24:25.030
IN MIND AS WE KEEP LOOKING AT

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:28.066
ALL THIS IS.

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.634
WE OFFICER THE THE ISSUE BETWEEN

00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:31.770
URBAN AND RURAL.

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.238
AMWAY FOR IN THE URBAN SETTING

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.139
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE DENSITY --

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:35.207
WE HAVE THE DIFFICULTY OF TRAVEL

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:35.907
WHATEVER BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:37.809
AVAILABILITY OF A WIDER RANGE OF

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:38.543
SERVICES IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.811
SETTING.

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:41.446
YOU DON'T HAVE THE DENSITY BUT

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:43.081
TO CONSUMERS ARE SO MUCH FOR

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:44.950
THEIR SPREAD APART TO SUCH AS A

00:24:45.016 --> 00:24:45.817
REDUCED.

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:47.419
LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT ARE

00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:48.620
AVAILABLE SO.

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:50.222
I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:52.023
VARIABLES THAT YOU KNOW AS WE

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.160
LOOK AT THIS ACROSS THE STATE --

00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:57.229
IN TERMS OF SETTING SORT OF A

00:24:57.295 --> 00:25:00.131
FLAT RATE OR A COST RECOVERY

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:02.968
RATE OR EVEN MAKING SOME

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:06.438
ADJUSTMENTS -- TO SO MANY

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.472
VARIABLES GO INTO THAT -- I

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:08.773
THINK AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FOR

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.775
WHICH CERTAINLY GOING TO KEEP

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:13.612
ALL OF THIS IN MIND -- THUS FAR

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:15.213
THOUGH WE HAVEN'T SEEN -- COME

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.214
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MAKING

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:18.049
THAT SHIFT TO A DIFFERENT

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:22.520
METHODOLOGY WOULD BE THE WISE

00:25:22.587 --> 00:25:23.355
THING TO DO YET [inaudible]

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:25.490
HI.

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:27.125
AND THEN WHEN IT COMES -- SUE

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:30.962
THE SSA REIMBURSEMENTS -- I A I

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.763
DON'T THINK ANYONE WAS SAYING

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.131
THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND TRIED

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.200
SPEND THOSE FUNDS WISELY -- I

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.034
THINK WE'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:40.038
THE VOLATILITY OF THE FUNDS SO --

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:43.108
YOU KNOW WE HAVE YOUR CHART FROM

00:25:43.174 --> 00:25:46.177
200-082-2000 NINETEEN AND I MEAN

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:47.612
WHEN'S LOW SEVEN POINT EIGHT

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:49.047
MILLION AND AS HIGH AS FORTY

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:51.416
MILLION SO -- AND I GUESS THE

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:53.351
CONCERN IS IS THAT THE WAY WE'RE

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:56.388
DOING.

00:25:56.454 --> 00:26:02.227
THE PAYMENTS -- IN TERMS OF THE

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:02.827
PAYMENT HERE I GUESS WE HAVE

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.229
THIS.

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:05.397
MECHANISM THAT WE'RE DOING SO

00:26:05.463 --> 00:26:06.865
TRYING AVOID LOCKING IN THE

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:09.467
HIGHER LEVEL STATE EXPENDITURES --

00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:11.036
FOR THE ON THE V. OUR PROGRAM SO

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.370
THAT'S WHY WE'RE USING THE SSA

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:14.973
REIMBURSEMENTS -- TO FUND THE

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.242
THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS

00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:19.110
BUT I GUESS I I JUST.

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:20.879
IN TERMS SO.

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.047
IN TERMS OF WHERE FALLS ON THE

00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:23.815
PART OF WHAT HAPPENED SO WHAT

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.717
HAPPENS IF THE SSA

00:26:25.784 --> 00:26:28.086
REIMBURSEMENTS ARE LOW RATE WE

00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:29.955
HAVE A DOWNTURN AND THEY AND

00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:32.290
THEY DROPPED.

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:34.292
IT BUT YOU HAVE WE GOT TO MAKE

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:35.961
SOME DECISIONS ABOUT.

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:36.995
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO WE JUST

00:26:37.062 --> 00:26:37.996
STICK TO THE SSA REIMBURSEMENT

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:40.031
AND JUST SQUEEZE EVERYBODY ALL

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:41.032
THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU TOLD

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:43.301
ME OURS ARE PRIORITY LIST AND

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:45.070
THEN WE THEN THINK ABOUT GENERAL

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:47.138
FUND OF FUNDS SOME OF THE THE

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:48.540
THAT SAID WE DON'T WANT TO CUT

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:48.940
IT THAT SEVERELY.

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:50.742
SO I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.744
WE RAISING IN TERMS OF USING AT

00:26:52.811 --> 00:26:54.746
THE SSA REIMBURSEMENTS BECAUSE

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:55.981
THAT THEY THERE IS SIGNIFICANT

00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:57.215
FLUCTUATION FROM.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.750
YEAR TO YEAR IN THE AMOUNT OF

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:02.354
REVENUE THAT'S GOING TO COME

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.656
FROM THAT PARTICULAR SOURCE.

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:05.957
I MEAN I THINK.

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.959
GOOD POINTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:10.095
CERTAINLY THE INFORMATION THE

00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:10.528
AGENDA THAT ROUTE.

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:11.563
UP TAKEN REVENUE HAS BEEN THERE

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.698
BECAUSE IT IT REALLY HAD GONE

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:14.866
DOWN.

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:16.534
WE ARE CERTAINLY VERY HOPEFUL

00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:17.369
THAT REVENUE STAYS -- BUT THAT

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:18.503
YOU KNOW OVERALL WE ALWAYS LOOK

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.071
AT OUR RESOURCES YOU KNOW YEAR

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.506
BY YEAR WE HAVE A FISCAL

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:22.841
FORECASTING.

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:24.476
THAT ENSURES A WE'RE PROJECTING

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:26.011
IN BOTH THE REVENUE THAT'S GOING

00:27:26.077 --> 00:27:27.746
TO COME IN IN THIS CASE ON THE

00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:29.180
PROGRAM INCOME.

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:30.548
SUCH COOLEY REIMBURSEMENTS -- AS

00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:32.417
WELL AS OUR EXPENDITURES AND SO

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.786
AS IT WOULD BE WITHIN THE OTHER

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:36.888
TIME WE ARE YOU KNOW OUR

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:38.456
RESOURCES WORE TIGHT WE WOULD

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:39.991
CERTAINLY BE WORKING -- THROUGH

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:41.526
THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH YOU

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:44.195
AS OUR PARTNERS TO ADDRESS THAT

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:46.231
THE IT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:48.066
SEEING WHERE THAT WILL

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:49.701
MATERIALIZE -- AS AN ISSUE OF

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:50.702
COURSE YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:53.104
TOMORROW'S ECONOMIC CONDITION

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:55.740
AND AND WHAT OCCURS WITHOUT BUT

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:56.975
WE WOULDN'T SEE THIS ANY

00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:58.143
DIFFERENT VAN.

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:02.280
IF THE PRESSURE WOULD BE ON

00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:05.216
GENERAL FUND AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:06.184
YES FINALLY I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:07.152
THAT SO SECURING PERSONS THEY

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:08.520
ARE CONNECTED TO THE ECONOMY SO

00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:09.788
FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE IN

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:10.455
TWENTY TWELVE THERE'S A KIND OF

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.890
A LOW POINT AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:13.324
THERE'S A ONE TO TWO YEAR LACKED

00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:14.926
WHEN THE REIMBURSEMENTS COME IN

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:15.960
BECAUSE OF HOW.

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.228
SOCIAL SECURITY MINISTRATION

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:19.164
WORKS BUT NOW YOU SEE THAT AS OF

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.699
THIS YEAR'S FORTY MILLION AND

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:23.001
TWELVE FOR FIRST YEAR TWENTY

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:23.568
EIGHTEEN WHICH IS TIED TO A

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:24.102
STRONG ECONOMY AND GETTING

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:26.471
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:29.374
EMPLOYED SO -- I THAT THE

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:30.642
DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY HAS SOME

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:31.876
INFLUENCE OVER THE THROUGH THEIR

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:33.144
YOU KNOW WORK INCENTIVE PLAN IS

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.480
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE ON

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:36.648
EXERCISES DE I AM FLOYD.

00:28:36.714 --> 00:28:37.782
SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE CONTROL

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:39.184
OVER THIS INTO TO SOME DEGREE

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.585
WEST GENERAL FUND.

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:42.253
IT'S ON THE BROADER ECONOMIC --

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.788
CONDITIONS AND IT'S ALSO

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:47.659
NECESSARILY A KNOCK WALL TILE --

00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:48.693
RIGHT ON BECAUSE OF OUR LINES OF

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.228
PERSONAL INCOME TAX RETURN SO AT

00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:52.397
LEAST THIS WE HAVE SOME%

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:53.998
INFLUENCE OVER HOW MUCH WEEKEND

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.733
SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY AND

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.401
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER LA -- WOULD

00:28:56.468 --> 00:29:00.538
HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THIS IS THAT.

00:29:00.605 --> 00:29:01.473
RECOGNIZING THE VOLATILITY BOTH

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:03.174
OF THE GENERAL FUND HAND OF THIS

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:07.378
SOURCE -- NOW I HEAR YEAR TO

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:09.047
YEAR I I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:11.216
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE STRATEGIC

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:14.352
PLANNING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD IF --

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:16.187
AND IT'S A QUESTION SEE IF

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:16.855
BECAUSE OF PRIDE THE A WIN.

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.857
THERE'S A DOWNTURN THAT WE THAT

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:20.358
WE CAN SET SOME EXPECTATIONS

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:23.128
ABOUT WHAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:24.362
WOULD YOU KNOW.

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.931
DO ARE PRIORITIZE IN TERMS OF

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:28.666
SOME OF THESE MONIES RIGHT SO

00:29:28.733 --> 00:29:32.403
I'D SO THAT WE SENATE P. IS THE

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.738
SAYS I KNOW YOU WORK WITH A LOT

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:34.539
OF THE NONPROFIT SUPPORTS OF

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.374
PEOPLE CAN PLAN OBVIOUSLY NO ONE

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:38.776
WANTS TO CUT RIGHT AND DOWN ON

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:40.245
BUT I I I I I THINK.

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:40.945
THAT -- SETTING SOME

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:43.214
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT IN

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:45.216
GENERAL THE PRIORITIES ARE

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:45.917
STRATEGY I MEAN WHAT YOU THAT

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:47.185
WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO OF COURSE

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:48.653
THEN COMES TO A FUTURE BUDGET

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.054
SUBCOMMITTEE AND FUTURE DECISION

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:52.557
BY FUTURE PARTS FINANCES AND DEL

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:54.826
AT AND MAYBE GOVERNOR SO WE'VE

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.327
REALLY LUCKY ON THE REVENUE

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:56.594
ALTERNATE.

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:57.662
DOWNTURN IN HIS -- EIGHT YEARS

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:01.766
IN OFFICE -- BUT BUT I THINK

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.034
THAT WE MAY WANT IT JUST THINK

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.502
ABOUT WHAT IT WHAT OUR

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:06.571
PRIORITIES GIVEN THE CURRENT

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:08.373
FUNDING STRUCTURE AND WHAT WE

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:10.408
MIGHT DO IS SO THAT WE CAN SET

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:13.178
SOME EXPECTATIONS FOR PEOPLE. TO

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:13.811
TO TO AT LEAST BUILD ANTICIPATE

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:15.413
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WHAT

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.116
WOULD HAPPEN.

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:24.222
AND SO WIDE THAT.

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:26.357
AND AND I THINK.

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:27.992
WE JUST ALL CONCERNED ABOUT

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:29.594
TYING SERVE THEM WHAT WHAT THE

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:30.562
IMPLICATION OF TYING THIS TO

00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:32.263
THIS REVENUE SOURCE OF ALRIGHT

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.564
[inaudible]

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.166
OKAY.

I CAN DRESS ISSUE TO BE.

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:42.840

LICENSED YOU WOULD THINK

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:25.661
INTUITIVELY THAT THIS WOULD BE

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:27.262
AN EASY TASK FOR US TO FIGURE

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.932

RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:27.042
SURE THAT THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:29.845
WHAT WE DO TO HELP INFORM US

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:33.515

THIS CURRENT BUDGET AND SO SEVEN

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:39.888
AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.289
WE'VE SEEN -- OVER THE YEARS

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:42.357
WITH ALL THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:43.725
INCREASES THAT WE'VE DONE SOME

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.927
ADJUSTMENTS AFTER LOOKING BACK

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.195
AT WHAT THE ACTUAL IS HAVE BEEN

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:49.398
AND AND JUST MAKING DE.

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.799
IN AND DEVELOPING ESTIMATES FOR

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:52.501
WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE IMPACT IS

01:17:52.567 --> 01:17:53.502
GOING TO BE IT'S IT'S A BIT OF A

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:54.503
CHALLENGE FOR A NUMBER OF

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.904
REASONS.

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.172
ONE WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HIRE

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.840
FOLKS DIRECTLY SO WE DON'T KNOW

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:00.442
HOW MANY EMPLOYEES THERE ARE AND

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:01.043
WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:01.777
PAID.

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:02.944
AND THEN ALSO SME SOME

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.379
INTERMEDIATE THINGS THAT OCCUR

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:05.714
AS WELL WHEN WE START TO GET A

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:08.283
TREND WE ALSO HAVE SOME OTHER --

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.252
FACTORS SUCH AS RATE INCREASES

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:11.820
THAT CAME IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:13.622
SIXTEEN WHERE WE SAW SLOW DOWN

01:18:13.688 --> 01:18:15.090
THEN AND MINIMUM WAGE.

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.459
AND IN THE LIKE INTO ALSO

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.393
ANYTHING SO SOMEONE ASKING WHAT

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:20.662
ARE SOME OF THE REASONS BEHIND

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:21.463
THAT I MEAN IT JUST REALLY IS

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.864
THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:24.232
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE PUT IN AND

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:25.667
THEN WE TRY AND IN THE ESTIMATE

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:27.869
AND WE TRY TO UPDATE BASED ON

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:28.336
ACTUAL AS AS WE MOVE.

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:31.106
FORWARD -- BUT IT IS IT IS A

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:32.874
CHALLENGE IN DOING THAT WE ARE

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:35.544
SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:36.545
OF REQUESTS THIS YEAR THEY'VE

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:38.814
BEEN ABOUT TWICE AS MANY THIS

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.714
YEAR'S THERE WERE LAST YEAR.

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:41.249
YEAH -- OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:43.151
MONTHS WILL HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:45.253
THAT FISCAL IMPACT IS.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.388
IN THAT SOMETHING ACTUALLY BEEN

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:47.556
EXPECTING AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE

01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:54.563
BEEN -- WITH OUR MINIMUM WAGE

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:57.566
ESTIMATE HAS BEEN -- DO WE WE

01:18:57.632 --> 01:18:59.267
HAVE BEEN -- THE CAREFUL TO

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:00.335
BRING IT DOWN TOO MUCH KNOWING

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:01.236
THAT IS THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:01.870
CONTINUES TO GO UP IS GONNA BE

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:03.371
MORE MORE EMPLOYEES.

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:04.172
ALSO THERE'S A REQUEST FOR AN

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.775
ESTIMATE -- ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:07.776
TAKE FOR THOSE.

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:09.344

HAVE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:50.051
ORDINANCES ARE NOT ABLE TO

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:52.220
ACCESS THE INCREASES ASSOCIATED

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.822
WITH THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.524

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.696
OF HIT TWO FOLD.

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:04.065
ONE THEY HAVE TO PAY A HIGHER.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:05.767
WAGE BECAUSE OF THE LOCAL

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:07.202

BE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:22.817
THE DEPARTMENT'S ESTIMATES OF

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:49.384
TO V..

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:53.254
STATE MINIMUM WAGE THAT TO

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:54.589
INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT.

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:55.156
EVEN THOUGH THEY TECHNICALLY

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:56.691
AREN'T PAYING THEIR PEOPLE MORE

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:57.258
BUT I MEAN WE SAID A

01:24:57.325 --> 01:25:00.128
REIMBURSEMENT IT WASN'T BASED ON

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:03.264
THEIR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE.

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.899
I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:06.367

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:10.138
ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION IS ON

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:12.307
THIS.

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:14.008
AS SOON HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS BUT

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:14.509
THAT.

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:15.877
IS NOT WHAT THE MINISTRATIONS

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:16.911
POSITION ON THIS [inaudible]

01:25:16.978 --> 01:25:17.812
YES IT.

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:19.047
THE POSITION IS IS THAT TO THE

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:22.383
EXTENT THAT THEY ARE PAID BELOW.

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:23.618
THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE --

01:25:23.685 --> 01:25:25.887
THAT'LL STATE MINIMUM WAGE THEN

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.121
THEY'LL ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE.

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:28.890
THAT INCREASE.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:29.657
WILL.

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:31.359
IF THE RATES ARE BELOW THE

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:32.927
MINIMUM WAGE BUT THEY'RE PAYING

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.462
HIGHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MEET

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:36.464
THE LOCAL MINIMUM RIGHT AGE BUT

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:38.199
AND THE RATE AT WHICH THEY'RE

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:40.568
BEING REIMBURSED DID NOT TAKE

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.070
THAT AND THE COUNTY JUST SORT OF

01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:44.038
MADE IT WORK.

01:25:44.105 --> 01:25:45.773
RIGHT OR OF THE AND THE STATE'S

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.475
POSITION IS WE DON'T FIND WE

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:49.210
DON'T SUPPORT THE LOCAL MINIMUM

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:50.044
WAGE.

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:51.913
OKAY BUT WE SUPPORT THE STATE

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.181
MINIMUM WAGERATE.

01:25:53.248 --> 01:25:55.950
SO WE SHOULD AT LEAST IF WE HAVE

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:56.718
OUR STATE MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:57.986
UP WE SHOULD MAKE SOME

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.087
ADJUSTMENT FOR AT LEAST THE

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:00.855
STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE AND

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.390
IF THEIR RATES ARE BELOW THAT

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:04.092
THEN THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.260
INCREASE AND IF THEY'RE READY

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.928
PAYING HIGHER.

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:08.897
THAN THAT BECAUSE THE LOCAL

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:11.766
MINIMUM WAGE STATION.

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.001
EVEN THOUGH THE STATEMENT WAY I

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:15.203
REALIZE THAT TECHNICALLY THE

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:17.138
WAGES OF THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVEN'T

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:18.973
CHANGED BECAUSE THE SEED AWAY TO

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.043
STILL MAY BE BEHIND FOR THE

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:23.177
LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES.

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:24.479
BUT ALSO THE ORIGINAL RATE THAT

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:25.280
THEY WERE REIMBURSED LIST DIDN'T

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:27.115
TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE LOCAL

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:28.583
MINIMUM WAGE RATE WHICH IS

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:29.918
HIGHER CORRECT.

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:31.019
YEAH AND AND THAT'S WHAT THE

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:32.353
ESTIMATE I BELIEVE THAT THE

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.955
DEPARTMENT PROVIDED WAS SUPPOSED

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.623
TO REFLECT IS WHAT THAT.

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:38.826
COST WOULD BE TO FIND AT THAT

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:40.161
INCREASE.

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:42.230
OKAY SO THE ESTIMATE IS TO

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:43.965
INCREASE MATTER WHICH LOCALITY

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.066
URINE.

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:46.401
YEAH THAT WAS THE ESTIMATE --

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:48.336
THEY PROVIDED IT WAS LIKE

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:50.371
ALRIGHT PROVIDERS REGARDLESS.

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:51.739
FOR THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE IN

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:53.274
RIGHT NOT THE LOCAL MEN OKAY AND

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:54.943
THE NUMBERS THAT I GAVE YOU

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:57.412
WOULD BE A HALF YEAR COSTS

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:58.346
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE WITH THE

01:26:58.413 --> 01:26:59.414
BRING THEM ON YEAH OKAY SO WE

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.351
WILL SO THE INTENTION IS THAN.

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.686
TO BOB SURE AMANDA ROVIDES LIKE

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:05.553

WE'RE GOING TO GIVE.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:12.026
THEM AN ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE

01:27:12.093 --> 01:27:12.627
INCREASE IN THE STATE MINIMUM

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:13.428
WAGE.

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:16.164
EVERYONE WHEN YOU SAY INTENT I I

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:17.665
THINK WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE.

ON THAT.

THIS IS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:43.284
TO THE PRINCIPLES OF A CBS AND

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:45.353
AS IT IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:47.521
INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND PROBABLY

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:53.394
LIKELY WILL -- AFFECT A PERSON'S

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.896
ABILITY. TO TO KEEP AN

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:57.231
EMPLOYMENT YOU KNOW IT'LL HINDER

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:57.698
THEIR OPPORTUNITIES.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:58.265
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE

01:33:58.332 --> 01:33:59.367
SOMEONE TO SUPPORT THEM A TO GO

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:00.801
TO WORK ON AND THE DAY AFTER

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:03.371
THANKSGIVING OR YOU KNOW --

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:05.272
MEMORIAL DAY THEN THEY WON'T BE

01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:06.640
ABLE TO WORK AND THEN THAT

01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:08.376
THAT'S A PROBLEM SO THAT'S ONE

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.177
OF THE THINGS I THINK INITIALLY

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:12.113
JUST AS JORDAN SAID.

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:12.713
WHAT WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:13.681
THIS IS NOT A HOLIDAY THESE ARE

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:15.716
NOT PAID HOLIDAYS THIS IS THESE

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:16.517
ARE FOR LOTUS?

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:20.888
EATER FOURTEEN FURLOUGH DAYS IT.

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:23.157
TOO AND A SYSTEM THAT FOR YOU'RE

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:24.191
GOING TO HEAR TODAY AND A

01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:25.626
SPECIALLY ON MAY NINTH THAT IS

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:28.262
IN CRISIS AND HERE WE ARE.

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.064
WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT A CUT

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:31.699
AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE IN CRISIS.

01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:34.135
I THINK IT'S A NECESSARY -- AND

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:35.469
AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT'S H. E.

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:39.473
B. S. COMPLIANT AND LASTLY -- I

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.542
THINK THAT I DO YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:42.743
WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE SYSTEM

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:44.945
IN THE SOUTH AND AND WE NEED TO

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:47.148
CONSIDER -- MAYBE NOT HAVING

01:34:47.214 --> 01:34:49.617
HOLIDAYS AT ALL -- YOU KNOW THAT

01:34:49.683 --> 01:34:50.418
ARE.

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:52.620
THAT ARE MANDATED -- SO I'D LIKE

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:53.854
TO ASK YOU TO REPEAT RESEND THE

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:57.625
THE THIS PROPOSAL -- AND THAT

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:59.360
THE STATE LAW THAT THAT WOULD

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:00.961
CAUGHT WOULD PUT THIS IN PLACE.

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:02.530
AND IF NOT AT THE VERY LEAST

01:35:02.596 --> 01:35:05.232
DELAY IMPLEMENTATION -- UNTIL

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:07.435
THE RATE ISSUES AND THE H. CBS

01:35:07.501 --> 01:35:12.740
ISSUES ARE -- KIND OF CLARIFIED.

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:15.342
MISTER CHAIRMAN MAY I APOLOGIZE

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:16.444
FOR HAD ONE WORD -- QUESTION --

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:17.912
REGARDING THE FIFTY POINT THREE

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:19.213
MILLION AND IT'S IT'S JUST A

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.748
QUESTION ON THE THE STAFF TO BE

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:21.582
MAYES JOB WITH THE AGENDA.

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:23.651
WE JUST WEREN'T CLEAR IF THAT IS

01:35:23.717 --> 01:35:25.886
FOR ALL FOURTEEN DAYS IS IT FOUR

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:28.122
DAYS -- REGARDING THE BUDGET

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:31.392
ITSELF I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:32.493
AN ANSWER ON THAT.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.027
I WAS JUST HOPEFUL TO GET

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:35.930
CLARIFICATION ON THAT.

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:38.432
YEAH ACTUALLY DIED PERHAPS A

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.334
YEAH DO YOU WANT CLEAR FIGHT

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.970
WITH THE THAT AMOUNT IS.

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:45.773
MISTER CHAIR -- THE THE FIFTY

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.974
POINT THREE MILLION IS DERIVED.

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:48.275
CAN BE DERIVED A COUPLE OF

01:35:48.342 --> 01:35:50.377
DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN WHAT

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:51.779
WE'RE ASSUMING BASICALLY.

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:54.715
IS THAT -- FOURTEEN REGIONAL

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:55.449
CENTERS.

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:58.185
HAD SEVEN DAY HOLIDAY SCHEDULES

01:35:58.252 --> 01:36:00.287
PRIOR.

01:36:00.354 --> 01:36:01.122
TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:01.989
ROLE.

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:04.158
AND SO SEVEN DAYS ARE BEING

01:36:04.225 --> 01:36:05.726
ADDED BACK INTO THE ESTIMATE FOR

01:36:05.793 --> 01:36:06.627
THAT.

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:08.996
AND THEN THE REMAINING SEVEN

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:10.564
REGIONAL CENTERS WHERE IT TEN

01:36:10.631 --> 01:36:14.068
DAYS PRIOR SO.

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:14.702
THE ESTIMATE ASSUMES THAT FOUR

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:15.970
DAYS ARE BEING ADDED BACK FOR

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:18.572
THAT.

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.074
IN THAT AND THEN WE BASE IT ON

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:23.577
THE COST PER DAY OF PROVIDING

01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:25.179
SERVICES BUT THE CLEAR FIVE IS

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:26.547
IT SAYS SO IF WE REPEAL THE

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.349
FOURTEEN DAY SCHEDULE TO COST IS

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:29.917
FIFTY POINT THREE MILLION.

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.552
THIRTY POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:32.786
FUND OR IS IT JUST.

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.788
OKAY SO THAT'S NOT JUST DIALING

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:36.790
IT BACK.

01:36:36.857 --> 01:36:38.058
TO THE DAYS AND FORTY ASSUME

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.793
THAT SOME REGIONAL CENTERS --

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.829
YOU HAVE TAKE HOLIDAYS IT

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:43.564
WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BE ZERO

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:44.765
HOLIDAYS IT WOULD ASSUME THAT ON

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:47.234
AVERAGE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:51.338
TAKING SEVEN TO EIGHT HALL.

01:36:51.405 --> 01:36:53.807
HOLIDAYS A YEAR.

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.876
BUT CONSIDERED STILL BE HOLIDAYS

01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:56.177
[inaudible]

01:36:56.243 --> 01:36:58.112
OKAY.

01:36:58.179 --> 01:36:59.547
SO IF I MAY ASK PLEASE FINANCE I

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:00.681
THINK.

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:01.549
LIKE MANY JOBS EVERYONE HOW IT

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:02.550
TAKES HOLIDAYS OFF I THINK WITH

01:37:02.616 --> 01:37:03.250
THIS ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:04.985
SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE WAS TWO

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:07.021
THINGS THAT HAPPENED.

01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:07.388
ONE IT'S THAT.

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:10.357
SPECIFIC DAYS IN WHICH HOLIDAYS

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:12.226
WERE TO BE TAKEN SO THERE WAS

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:14.261
SOME UNIFORMITY HENCE THE

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:16.897
UNIFORM HOLIDAY -- TITLE SO THE

SOME UNIFORMITY SO SAVINGS IN

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:19.900
THAT REGARD AND THEN IN ADDITION

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:21.302
THERE WAS SOME SAVINGS WITH

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:23.003
REGARDS TO HOW MANY DAYS WERE TO

01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:24.538
BE TAKEN.

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:26.440
SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE TOO

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:29.743
FOLDED TYPE OF ISSUE OKAY SURE

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:31.879

NOTED IS IS THAT.

01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:35.683

01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:10.150
ON THIS -- MISTER LINDSEY AND

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:10.985
MISS CHANCE POINTED OUT YOU KNOW

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:11.919
THESE WERE IMPLEMENTED WHEN THE

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.387
STATE WAS TRYING TO SOLVE IT

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:13.954
TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:15.322
BUDGET SHORTFALL IN THE GENERAL

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:15.823
FUND.

01:38:15.889 --> 01:38:17.491
SO MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT

01:38:17.558 --> 01:38:19.460
WERE IMPLEMENTED THAT TIME

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:22.463
REMAIN IN FACT AND SO THESE ARE

01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:23.797
PROPOSALS THAT.

01:38:23.864 --> 01:38:25.966

WANNA JUST RAISE A A POINT OF

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:39.713
THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO TO ALSO

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:42.549
THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE THE

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.418
REGIONAL CENTERS OBSERVING THEIR

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:46.153
OWN HOLIDAY SCHEDULES EVEN IN

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.621
THE ABSENCE OF A STATE WIDE

01:38:47.688 --> 01:38:49.890
POLICY -- I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:51.492
EASY TO FORGET THAT THESE WHOLE

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:53.761
THESE HOLIDAYS ARE FERTILIZER

01:38:53.827 --> 01:38:55.429
HOWEVER PEOPLE ON A REFER TO

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:58.365
THEM -- REALLY ONLY AFFECT A

01:38:58.432 --> 01:38:59.867
CERTAIN SERVICE CATEGORIES SO

CORNERS ARE RESIDENTIAL SERVICES

01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:08.876
AND THAT SORT OF THING SO A LOT

01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:09.943
OF THESE DAY PROGRAMS MIGHT NOT

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:12.012
BE OPERATING ON SAY CHRISTMAS

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:14.882
DAY ANYWAY -- SO THAT'S JUST.

01:39:14.948 --> 01:39:16.750
ONE THING TO KEEP IN TO KEEP IN

01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:18.719
MIND JUST FOR CONTEXT BUT IN

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.954
GENERAL ARE OFFICE -- YOU KNOW

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:22.523
pTHIS IS A BUT POLICY AT THE END

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:24.458
OF THE DAY IT COMES DOWN TO THE

01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:25.426
PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:26.527
AND THE PRIORITY OF THE

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:27.961
LEGISLATURE BUT WE DID.

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:30.030
WE DO KNOW THAT IT WAS EIGHTY

01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:31.999
POLICY THAT WAS TAKEN DURING A

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:33.701
RECESSIONARY TIME AND THAT WERE

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:35.803
IN DIFFERENT TIMES NOW -- I ALSO

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.571
WAS CURIOUS TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:38.939
WILL HOW MANY HOLIDAYS ARE

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:40.607

FOR THIS THE SERVICE PROVIDERS

01:39:51.251 --> 01:39:53.187
SO -- THE END OF THE DAY IT

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:54.488
COMES DOWN TO I MEAN THERE WOULD

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:56.190
BE A COST WITH REPEALING IT BUT

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:58.726
YEAH.

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:00.694
THANK YOU THANK COMES FINANCE.

THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE AREN'T

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:22.883
IT DOESN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:24.651
SOME OF THOSE SERVICE CATEGORIES

01:40:24.718 --> 01:40:26.787

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:30.924
PEOPLE GET THEIR JOB SUPPORT

01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:32.192
THREE DAY PROGRAMS.

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:33.861
SO IF THEY HAVE THEIR JOB

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:35.396
SUPPORT THREE DAY PROGRAM AND

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:36.797
THEY'RE WORKING ON BLACK FRIDAY

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.165
THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING AND

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:39.666
THAT'S A REQUIRED HOLIDAYS THEY

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:41.135
DON'T HAVE THE JOB SUPPORT ON

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:42.403
THAT DAY.

01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:45.339
SO THERE THESE TRICKY NUANCES

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:47.141
BUT I THINK THE REASON SOME OF

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:48.642
THE I I MEAN I CAN'T SPEAK FOR

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:49.710
ALL THE REGIONAL CENTERS BUT I

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:52.112
THINK ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

01:40:52.179 --> 01:40:52.746
SOME OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS DID

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:53.781
HAVE.

01:40:53.847 --> 01:40:55.416
A POLICIES LIKE SEVEN DAYS THEY

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:57.117
PICKED THE DAYS THAT MOST OF THE

01:40:57.184 --> 01:40:58.285
SERVICE PROVIDERS WARRANT

01:40:58.352 --> 01:41:01.121
PROVIDING SERVICES ANYWAY OKAY

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:01.422
[inaudible]

01:41:01.488 --> 01:41:02.689
OKAY [inaudible]

01:41:02.756 --> 01:41:08.896
THE ANYTHING I MEAN SO I A HEAR

01:41:08.962 --> 01:41:10.330
YOU TALK ABOUT THE CELL OF ANY

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:12.866
ANY OF THE OPINIONS ABOUT THAT

01:41:12.933 --> 01:41:14.401
AND HIS IS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:15.068
THAT.

01:41:15.135 --> 01:41:16.470
I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHAT I

01:41:16.537 --> 01:41:17.404
THINK I THINK WE'RE HEARING

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:18.138
FOURTEEN SOUNDS A LITTLE ONE

01:41:18.205 --> 01:41:19.139
REASONABLE OBVIOUSLY

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:22.075
RECESSIONARY MOVE -- BUT

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:23.410
ALLOWING SOME.

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:27.681
SOME DAYS MAY MAKE SENSE JUST

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:31.118
BECAUSEDEL THAT'S FUNCTIONALLY

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:31.752
WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING AND OUT

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:32.386
OF THE CAN YOU CAN YOU REIMBURSE

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:33.153
FOR SOMETHING WE ARE NOT

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.822
PROVIDING THE SERVICE ANYWAY SO

01:41:34.888 --> 01:41:36.790
IT SO I GUESS THAT'S I THINK

01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:37.624
WHAT'S I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE

01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:38.292
OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. TO

01:41:38.358 --> 01:41:38.892
POINT OUT HERE AND AND AND ONE

01:41:38.959 --> 01:41:40.060
OF THEM IS THAT WE'RE TOLD ON

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:42.062
MANY OCCASIONS THAT THINGS ARE

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:44.264
BUSINESS DECISION AND TRULY FOR

01:41:44.331 --> 01:41:45.699
ANY OTHER BUSINESS.

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:47.701
WHAT HOLIDAYS YOU'RE CLOSED FOR

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:48.769
IS A BUSINESS DECISION?

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:50.904
IN IN OUR CASE THAT'S NOT TRUE

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:52.739
IT'S IT'S NOT A BUSINESS

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:54.508
DECISION IT'S WHAT WE'RE TOLD WE

01:41:54.575 --> 01:41:56.310
HAVE TO BE CLOSED IF WE WANT TO

01:41:56.376 --> 01:41:58.579
SUPPORT SOMEONE ON THAT DAY

01:41:58.645 --> 01:41:59.179
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET PAID FOR

01:41:59.246 --> 01:41:59.379
THAT.

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:01.248
MEANING THAT THE PERSON THAT'S

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:02.883
PROVIDING THAT SUPPORT WON'T GET

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.118
PAID -- SO I THINK THAT'S

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.520
IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO AND AND

01:42:06.587 --> 01:42:08.555
THEN THE OTHER THING THAT AND

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:11.458
AND I APPRECIATE -- YOU SONNY AT

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:13.427
THE SHARING F THAT YOU KNOW

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:15.829
MOST PLACES THE STATE HOLIDAYS

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:16.196
ARE.

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:17.331
TEN THE THE THING THAT WE NEED

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:18.832
TO ALWAYS REMEMBER IS THAT THOSE

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:21.301
ARE PAID HOLIDAYS -- IT'S NOT

01:42:21.368 --> 01:42:22.436
PAID HOLIDAYS FOR OUR FOLKS TO

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:23.403
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PROVIDING

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.372
SUPPORT OUR DIRECT SUPPORT

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:29.409
PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE SO UNDER

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:30.878
PAID AS IT IS.

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:33.146
ARE ALSO NOW BEING FORCED TO

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:33.614
HAVE DAYS OFF UNPAID.

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:34.781
SO BUT IT'S THOSE KINDS OF

01:42:34.848 --> 01:42:35.582
THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:35.849
REMEMBER.

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:37.351
OKAY.

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:40.120
OKAY AND JUST TO AT AT ON WHAT

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:42.122
YOU WERE ASKING -- IT REALLY

01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:43.557
APPRECIATE ELOISE COMMENTS --

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:45.292
THEY'RE VERY THOROUGH AND NO I

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.094
DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS ASKING IN

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.495
ADDITION BE ANY HOLIDAYS TAKEN

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:50.364
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE --

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.999
BUT AGAIN THAT FOURTEEN DAYS

01:42:52.065 --> 01:42:54.401
SEEMS TO BE EXCESSIVE IN ALL TO

01:42:54.468 --> 01:42:56.637
ME ARE JUST ASKING. FOR LOW'S

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:59.039
FOR WORKERS OR FOR PROVIDERS TO

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:01.942
HAVE TO EAT THAT COST -- IF

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:03.911
THERE WERE SEVEN SOME REAL

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:04.745
CENTERS IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE

01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:06.113
WAS A SURVEY OR SOMETHING TAKEN

01:43:06.179 --> 01:43:07.147
WERE SUMMER TAKEN SEPARATE

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:09.583
SUMMER TAKING -- TEN I THINK WE

01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:09.783
CAN.

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:13.220
LIKELY FIND A PLACE WHERE NOBODY

01:43:13.287 --> 01:43:14.855
WOULD COME TO AGREEMENT ON THAT

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:15.255
OKAY.

01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:16.290
ALL RIGHT.

01:43:16.356 --> 01:43:18.358
THEN SO -- SO I HOPE THAT -- WE

01:43:18.425 --> 01:43:19.927
CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIN THIS

01:43:19.993 --> 01:43:22.563
THING -- THIS FOURTEEN DOES SEEM

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:23.497
A BIT EXCESSIVE.

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:24.164
AND THE SAID I THINK

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:26.400
FUNCTIONALLY IT IS THAT DOES AT

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:27.935
THAT POINT.

01:43:28.001 --> 01:43:30.871
SO LIKE A FORCE FOR LOW ARE ARE

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.139
ARE IN PAID WORK.

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:34.041
WELL FIRST FORCE FOR LOW SORTS

01:43:34.107 --> 01:43:35.008
SO.

01:43:35.075 --> 01:43:36.677
IT DOESN'T LINE UP WITH

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:38.545
CERTAINLY WHAT STATE S. OF WORTH

01:43:38.612 --> 01:43:39.546
I THINK THERE IS A POINT I

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:41.448
RECOGNIZE THAT YOU COULD SAY

01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:43.750
WELL EVEN AND EVEN THE BILL DOES

01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:45.552
SHOULD BE EVEN PAID HOLIDAYS --

01:43:45.619 --> 01:43:46.820
BUT THAT'S A FURTHER DISCUSSION

01:43:46.887 --> 01:43:56.863
BUT AT LEAST I THINK -- LET'S IT

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:59.132
SEEMS LAW AND REASONABLE TO BE --

01:43:59.199 --> 01:44:01.868
ASKING TELLING THEY HAVE TO DO

01:44:01.935 --> 01:44:02.469
FOURTEEN AND WE DIDN'T REALLY

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:03.303
TOUCHED -- THAT THE HALF THE

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:05.839
BILLING ISSUE.

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:06.373
AT THE THIS IS.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:09.309
SO USE.

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:10.510
YEAH WE DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT

01:44:10.577 --> 01:44:12.579
THAT SO.

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:13.847
ON THE THEY HAVE TO BILLING --

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:15.782
MISTER CHAIR IS IN EFFECT IN THE

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:16.450

ON AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:19.386

BUDGET YEAR.

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:21.788
AND BASICALLY.

01:44:21.855 --> 01:44:23.557
ON WHAT THE HAVE THE BILLING

01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:25.859
ROOM THE SAVINGS ARE MINOR -- WE

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:28.595
WERE ESTIMATING COST SAVINGS OF

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:30.564

COST OF ENFORCING IT IS GOING TO

01:46:21.908 --> 01:46:26.446

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:44.531
RECENT REVIEWS THAT HAS TO DO

01:46:44.598 --> 01:46:45.932
WITH REVIEWING ANY HALF DAY

01:46:45.999 --> 01:46:48.568
BILLING -- MIGHT HAVE TO GO BACK

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:50.437
AND VERIFY THAT BUT THERE HASN'T

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:52.472
BEEN AND AND AND NUMBER OF YEARS

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:54.174
THE FOCUS OF OUR REVIEWS HAVE

01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:56.777
BEEN ON ON OTHER AREAS AND IT

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:58.812
HAS NOT BEEN ON THAT.

01:46:58.879 --> 01:47:00.981
OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL IT IS SO I

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:03.984
GUESS WHAT CAUSES OPPOSES THAT.

01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:06.653
IF FOR DOING THIS IS IT REALLY

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.088
IS THAT WHAT WORTH IT IN TERMS

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:09.422
OF MONEY I'M A REJECT BUDGET

01:47:09.489 --> 01:47:11.758
SUBCOMMITTEE IN TERMS OF THE

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:12.759
OVERSIGHT AND SO FORTH AND WHAT.

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:14.394
BURDENS IT PLACES ON THE

01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:16.096
PROVIDERS VERSES THE MOUSE

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:18.598
SAVINGS WERE GETTING FROM THAT

01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:19.266
THAT BAG A SOON THERE'S A

01:47:19.332 --> 01:47:20.667
FEDERAL IMPERATIVE FOR US TO DO

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:21.434
THIS.

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:23.703
SO -- SO DOES THAT MAKE SENSE

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.172
RIGHT IS THAT WE JUST IMPOSING

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:26.406
IS THIS A SAVINGS REALLY WORTH

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:27.307
THE COST.

01:47:27.374 --> 01:47:28.575
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:32.846
IS THAT RELATED TO THAT IF WE

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:33.446
ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING LIKE

01:47:33.513 --> 01:47:34.848
THIS [inaudible]

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:38.852
THE DELF 65% IS A DEAL LOWER 2%

01:47:38.919 --> 01:47:41.822
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO TO

01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:42.923
IT HERE TO THIS AND THEN THIS --

01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:43.790
BUT I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION

01:47:43.857 --> 01:47:44.391
REALLY ISN'T WORTH IT I GUESS

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:47.027
THAT'S MY QUESTION GIVEN THE

01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:48.962
AMOUNT OF SAVINGS -- GETTING A

01:47:49.029 --> 01:47:51.298
SENSE OF WHAT DOES THAT INVOLVE

01:47:51.364 --> 01:47:53.233
WHAT DOES THAT REQUIRE OF THE

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.701
PROVIDERS WHAT DOES REQUIRE THE

01:47:54.768 --> 01:47:56.469
DEPARTMENT AND AND IS IT WORTH

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:58.572
THE TROUBLE I GUESS.

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:00.073
BECAUSE AT CERTAIN POINTS IN

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:01.107
TERMS OF YOU KNOW JUST

01:48:01.174 --> 01:48:02.709
BUREAUCRATIC EFFICIENCY DOESN'T

01:48:02.776 --> 01:48:04.878
MAKE SENSE TO OPPOSE THIS FOR

01:48:04.945 --> 01:48:06.112
THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:48:06.179 --> 01:48:07.547
ARE IN THE END IF WE'RE TRULY

01:48:07.614 --> 01:48:09.883
GOING TO DO THIS AND AND FORCE

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:11.151
IT IS IT END UP GOING TO COST

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:14.020
MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:48:14.087 --> 01:48:14.988
GOING TO SAVE [inaudible]

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:17.624
YES.

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:19.292
MR TERROR UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN

01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:19.960
THAT YOU'RE SHARING AN INTEREST

01:48:20.026 --> 01:48:20.427
WE'VE HAD NUMBER OF

01:48:20.493 --> 01:48:21.661
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PROVIDERS

01:48:21.728 --> 01:48:23.129
AND AND UNDERSTANDING THE

01:48:23.196 --> 01:48:24.998
CONCERN NOT ONLY OF THE HALF DAY

01:48:25.065 --> 01:48:26.399
BILLING AND THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY.

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:28.101
THEY THEY DISCUSSIONS OFTEN

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:30.070
KINDA GO TOGETHER -- SO WILL YOU

01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:31.504
KNOW WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT

01:48:31.571 --> 01:48:32.772
THE CONCERNS WE'VE HAD THE

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:36.576
DISCUSSIONS -- AND I A A

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:37.777
UNFORTUNATELY I'M AND IT'S

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:40.146
WITHIN -- THE PROPOSALS THAT WE

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:41.915
HAD OUR NOSES ARE CONTINUING TO

01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:45.151
MOVE FORWARD AS WE STATED OKAY

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:47.053
ALL RIGHT AND THANK YOU KNOW I

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.321
SO SO I JUST IMPOSE THAT I MEAN

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:48.889
I TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I CAN

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:49.689
UNDERSTAND PEOPLE SAYING WELL

01:48:49.756 --> 01:48:50.757
GEE IF YOU ONLY PROVIDED.

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:52.092
HALF DAY OF SERVICE WHERE WE

01:48:52.158 --> 01:48:55.528
PAYING A FULL DAY -- ALTHOUGH

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:57.664
THE 65% I GUESS YOU KNOW THE

01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:58.465
QUESTION ANDBUT I I THINK

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.667
THERE'S ALSO THE PART ABOUT THE

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:02.269
SAVINGS.

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:03.203
THIS WAS A AND I GUESS A MINOR

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:04.871
BECAUSE A LOT OF MONEY -- FOR

01:49:04.938 --> 01:49:07.374
PEOPLE BUT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:07.974
SAVINGS IN THE NUMBER PEOPLE

01:49:08.041 --> 01:49:14.481
INVOLVED I JUST WONDER ABOUT

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:16.683
WHETHER.

01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:17.617
HOW MUCH WORK IT WOULD TAKE TO

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:18.685
TRULY DO THIS MAKES IT REALLY

01:49:18.752 --> 01:49:22.188
MEANINGFUL TO DO IT AT ALL EIGHT

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:23.523
AND DOES STERN LESTER'S?

01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:25.759
YOU KNOW RAMPED IT.

01:49:25.825 --> 01:49:26.893
EFFORTS BY PEOPLE THE NOT RIGHTS

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:29.796
SERVICES TO PEOPLE AND WELL SO

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:31.665
THEY GET PAINFUL DAY BUT ONLY

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:33.133
CAN DO HALF I'M GONNA GIVE BILL

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.434
THEM DOWN THAT.

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:35.802
BUT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN THE

01:49:35.869 --> 01:49:36.436
WHITE IS THAT THE IN WIDESPREAD

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:37.170
WHICH I DON'T THINK IT IS YOU

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:38.972
NOT RAISING CONCERN THEN I'M NOT

01:49:39.039 --> 01:49:40.173
SURE WHY WE'RE DOING THIS.

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.875
SELL.

01:49:41.942 --> 01:49:42.676
IT AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:42.842
IT.

01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:43.810
THE SOMEBODY MIGHT GO HOME AFTER

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:45.645
65% OF THE DAY BUT THE STAFF

01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:46.813
WORK ON A REST ANPING RATIO SO

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.614
THE STAFF FOR NOT GOING HOME AND

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:49.349
SO THE COSTS TO THE PROVIDER IS

01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:50.350
STILL THE SAME.

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:51.484
I MEAN UNLESS YOU SEND THE STAFF

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:53.853
HOME AND AGAIN WE SHOULDN'T BE

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:58.458
TREATING OUR DIRECT SUPPORT

01:49:58.525 --> 01:49:59.759
PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE ALREADY.

01:49:59.826 --> 01:50:01.161
YOU KNOW STRUGGLING BY SENDING A

01:50:01.227 --> 01:50:03.563
HOME BECAUSE SOMEBODY IT GOT

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:04.331
WENT HOME EARLY.

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:05.498
BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT I

01:50:05.565 --> 01:50:06.700
THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.

01:50:06.766 --> 01:50:08.568
NO I THINK MOST OF THE TAXPAYER

01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:10.370
PUBLIC SAYS WE ONLY PROVIDE HALF

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:11.404
DAY OF SERVICE NO ARE WE PAYING

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:12.305
FOR THE WHOLE THING BUT AT THE

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:13.807
SAME TIME IS THAT I DON'T THINK.

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:15.875
PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTO AND I I

01:50:15.942 --> 01:50:17.410
HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT.

01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:19.179
PEOPLE ARE SETTING UP THEIR DAY

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:21.114
TO ONLY PROVIDE A QUOTE HALF DAY

01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:21.781
WHATEVER MONTH DOES SERVICE THEY

01:50:21.848 --> 01:50:22.816
REALLY ARE INTENDING TO PROVIDE

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.351
A FULL DAY THERE MAY BE OTHER

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:25.485
FACTORS ARE INVOLVED.

01:50:25.552 --> 01:50:29.522
BUT AND THEN ULTIMATELY WHETHER

01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:32.726
MAKES SENSE. TO TO TO DO THIS OR

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:33.927

WE TAKE FOR GRANTED.

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:06.813
AND IS ALSO A ABOUT NON MEDICAL

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:07.981
THERAPIES SUCH AS AT KLINE

01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:09.482

01:53:13.553 --> 01:53:15.388
WE KNOW THAT HISPANIC AFRICAN

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.690
AMERICAN AND ASIAN PEOPLE WITH

01:53:17.757 --> 01:53:18.992

01:53:19.058 --> 01:53:20.426

01:53:20.493 --> 01:53:20.927
ONCE.

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:22.195
WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE

01:53:22.262 --> 01:53:23.463
REASONS IS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:24.998
KEPT FUNDING FOR SOCIAL WORK

01:53:25.064 --> 01:53:30.870
PROGRAM SOMETHING THIS

01:53:30.937 --> 01:53:32.572
COMMUNITIES REALLY NEED.

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:33.940
AND REALLY HAVE USE AFTER THESE

01:53:34.007 --> 01:53:34.807
PROGRAMS WERE CUT FAMILIES WITH

01:53:34.874 --> 01:53:35.942

OF THEIR POCKET FOR FOR CHILDREN

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:39.779
FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES IS JUST

01:53:39.846 --> 01:53:41.447
ANOTHER WAY THAT THEY FACE THE

01:53:41.514 --> 01:53:42.382
SEVERITY.

01:53:42.448 --> 01:53:44.450
SO THEY'RE STAYING HOME AND THEY

01:53:44.517 --> 01:53:46.019
ARE NOT IN THE COMMUNITY AND

01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:48.254

FOR THE SAME TYPES OF REASONS IS

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:07.827

02:03:42.782 --> 02:03:44.183

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:01.974
ANYTHING TO START ADDRESSING

02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:03.142
THAT PROBLEM IT'S IT'S CURRENTLY

02:08:03.208 --> 02:08:05.744

02:08:06.278 --> 02:08:07.679
HIGH COST AREAS IT ALSO HAS

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:08.580

SO FINDING SOME WAY TO MAKE

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:13.285
THOSE ADJUSTMENTS IS CRITICAL --

02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:14.453
AS WANT TO ADDRESS A POINT I

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.021
KNOW THAT MISS BARTON MENTIONED

02:08:16.088 --> 02:08:17.089
DIRECT ABOUT TO MENTION THAT THE

SOLVE THIS.

02:08:21.193 --> 02:08:22.127
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT BECAUSE

02:08:22.194 --> 02:08:23.395
THAT'S AN INDIVIDUAL BY

02:08:23.462 --> 02:08:25.164
INDIVIDUAL PROCESS AND IS NO

LONGER BEING ALLOWED TO BE USED

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:28.100
TO ADJUST FOR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE

02:08:28.167 --> 02:08:29.668
FOR AN AGENCY SO WE REALLY DON'T

HAVE A FIX WE DO NEED THE

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:32.704
LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION

CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAD I I

02:08:37.342 --> 02:08:38.777
THINK EVERYONE'S GOING TO COVER

02:08:38.844 --> 02:08:39.812
THE WHAT THE IMPACT IS TO FAMILY

02:08:39.878 --> 02:08:41.847
MEMBERS STAFF AND CONSUMERS I

02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:43.115
WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT THE

02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:44.616
CONVERSATION YOU'RE HAVING ABOUT

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:45.484
WHAT THE CORRECT BUDGET NUMBER

02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:46.151
IS.

02:08:46.218 --> 02:08:47.920
AND WHAT WHAT THE HOW MANY DAYS

02:08:47.986 --> 02:08:49.755

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:50.923
JUST SAW THE ESTIMATE THAT WAS

02:08:50.989 --> 02:08:52.658

02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:54.726
THEY ARE EXPECTING IT TO FUND

02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:57.396
SIX DAYS -- THAT THAT FIFTY

02:08:57.463 --> 02:08:57.963
MILLION COVER SIX DAYS OF

02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:58.997
CLOSURES.

02:08:59.064 --> 02:09:00.666
WE DID A POLL OF OUR PROVIDERS

02:09:00.732 --> 02:09:01.533

ALMOST UNIMOG UNIFORMLY WE'RE

02:09:03.068 --> 02:09:05.871
LOOKING AT TEN AT TEN HOLIDAY SO --

02:09:05.938 --> 02:09:06.405
WE THINK THAT THAT BUDGT

02:09:06.472 --> 02:09:08.107
NUMBERS WRONG ON THE HALF DAY I

02:09:08.173 --> 02:09:09.575

THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:09:12.978 --> 02:09:14.046
BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:15.247
THAT THERE IS NO ADMINISTRATIVE

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:16.949
REQUIREMENT TO TRACK TIME AT

02:09:17.015 --> 02:09:17.883
THIS POINT SO WHEN IT WENT BACK

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:18.984
INTO AFFECT PROVIDERS HAD TO

02:09:19.051 --> 02:09:20.419
COME UP WITH SYSTEMS TO TRACK

02:09:20.486 --> 02:09:21.687
THAT TIME.

02:09:21.753 --> 02:09:26.058

02:09:34.366 --> 02:09:35.801
THE SUPPRESSION OF THE LOCAL

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:37.936
MINIMUM WAGE HAS EXACERBATED

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:40.105
THAT WE ARE NOW A MINIMUM WAGE --

02:09:40.172 --> 02:09:41.807
SYSTEM OR GETTING CLOSE TO IT

02:09:43.275 --> 02:09:44.309
MINIMUM WAGE GOES A FIFTEEN

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:46.111
DOLLARS THE BUDGET NUMBER NEED

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:47.713

MORE MORE AGENCIES THIS YEAR I

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:50.782
HAD FOUR PEOPLE WHO WOULD DO

02:09:50.849 --> 02:09:51.316
THAT.

02:09:51.383 --> 02:09:52.584
NEXT YEAR I'LL PROBABLY HAVE

CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:55.220
STAFF WHO POTENTIALLY WOULD

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:56.555
QUALIFY FOR THAT INCREASE.

02:09:56.622 --> 02:09:57.656
THAT NUMBER'S GONNA

02:09:57.723 --> 02:09:59.024
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE AS

02:09:59.091 --> 02:10:00.559
THAT INCREASES ONE OBVIOUSLY THE

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:03.228
HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IS A CHALLENGE.

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:05.097
ALSO THE HAVE TO FULLY BILLING

02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:06.698
HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT --

02:10:06.765 --> 02:10:08.667

ACCEPT THEIR BUDGET THEY'RE

02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:14.239
SAVING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ON THE

02:10:14.306 --> 02:10:16.875
BACKS OF CHOICE.

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:19.111
COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE A

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:20.245

ECHOING WITH EVERYONE SAYING --

02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:50.555
I THINK THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:51.890
FOURTEEN HOLIDAYS IS IS REALLY

02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:53.191
INSULTING IN A TIME OF

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:55.861
PROSPERITY WHEN IT WAS A CUT AND

02:13:55.927 --> 02:13:57.028
IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING TO

02:13:57.095 --> 02:13:58.563
CONTINUE TO HAVE TO SPEND ENERGY

02:13:58.630 --> 02:13:59.731
ON THIS ISSUE.

02:13:59.798 --> 02:14:00.732
BUT I REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS THE

02:14:00.799 --> 02:14:02.667
MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE I KNOW WILL

02:14:02.734 --> 02:14:04.002
BE DISCUSSED EVEN MORE NEXT WEEK

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:06.071
I APPRECIATE -- TRYING TO FIX

02:14:06.138 --> 02:14:07.372
THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE PROBLEM

02:14:07.439 --> 02:14:09.574
IT IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS WHAT

02:14:09.641 --> 02:14:10.909
THE HOOPS PEOPLE HAVE TO JUMP

02:14:10.976 --> 02:14:12.377
THROUGH BUT IT SADDENS ME

02:14:12.444 --> 02:14:14.146
GREATLY SADDENS ME THAT WE'RE

02:14:14.212 --> 02:14:15.580
TALKING ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE WE'RE

02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:16.882
TALKING ABOUT OUR WORK FORCE.

02:14:16.948 --> 02:14:18.283
THESE ARE NOT MINIMUM WAGE JOBS

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:19.584
THERE A LOT.

02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:22.120
A LOT OF JOBS THAT ARE EASIER

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:23.588
THAT REQUIRE A LOT LESS SKILL

02:14:23.655 --> 02:14:24.623
THAT PEOPLE CAN BE MAKING THE

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:25.824
SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY.

02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:29.060
AND THE FOLKS WE SUPPORT DESERVE.

02:14:29.127 --> 02:14:30.495
TO HAVE A SKILLED PROFESSIONAL

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:31.430
LIES WORKFORCE AND IF IT WAS

02:14:31.496 --> 02:14:33.098
YOUR FAMILY MEMBER THAT IS WHAT

02:14:33.165 --> 02:14:35.434
YOU WOULD WANT SO I HOPE THAT

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.868
THE DAY WILL COME WHEN WE DON'T

02:14:36.935 --> 02:14:37.669
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE

02:14:37.736 --> 02:14:39.504
MINIMUM WAGES BECAUSE WE'RE

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:40.705
MAKING SO MUCH MORE.

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:40.972
THANK YOU.

02:14:41.039 --> 02:14:42.741
THANK YOU.

02:14:42.808 --> 02:14:44.743
WELCOME I AM PADDY ANGER FROM

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:47.579
PATH POINT -- WE SERVE TWO

02:14:47.646 --> 02:14:48.113
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:49.581
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND

02:14:49.648 --> 02:14:51.817
WE PROVIDE SERVICES IN FIVE

02:14:51.883 --> 02:14:53.351
COUNTIES THROUGH CENTRAL AND

02:14:53.418 --> 02:14:55.454
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- I'D LIKE

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:57.856
TO COMMENT ON THE UNIFORMS

02:14:57.923 --> 02:14:59.758
CLOSURE DAYS.

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:02.961
AND WE ARE A SYSTEM IN CRISIS I

02:15:03.028 --> 02:15:03.695
THINK EVERYBODY WOULD

02:15:03.762 --> 02:15:05.597
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THE MAIN

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:06.932
REASON.

02:15:06.998 --> 02:15:08.300
IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT ATTRACT

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:09.801
STAFF AT THE WAGE WE CAN PAY

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.203
THEM.

02:15:11.269 --> 02:15:13.438
FISCAL THESE CLOSURE DAYS INTO

02:15:13.505 --> 02:15:14.439
FACT.

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:16.208
BECAUSE FOR AN ADDITIONAL ONE

02:15:16.274 --> 02:15:19.845
POINT SIX REDUCTION IN REVENUE.

02:15:19.911 --> 02:15:21.847
WE CAN'T CUT OUR COSTS ANYWHERE

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:24.716
ELSE EXCEPT UNFORTUNATELY STAFF

02:15:24.783 --> 02:15:25.717
WAGES.

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:28.453
MOST OF OUR COST OUR STAFF WAGES

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.455
THAT ONE POINT SIX REALLY

02:15:30.522 --> 02:15:32.657
BECOMES ABOUT 2% SO IT SEEMS

02:15:32.724 --> 02:15:36.361
VERY CONTRADICTORY. TO CUT STAFF

02:15:36.428 --> 02:15:38.964
WAGES 2% WHEN WE HAVE A SYSTEM

02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:40.432
IN CRISIS.

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:41.900
PRIMARILY BECAUSE STAFF WAGES

02:15:41.967 --> 02:15:43.668
ARE TOO LOW.

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:45.537
WE HAVE TO SEND PEOPLE HOME

02:15:45.604 --> 02:15:47.072
REGULARLY BECAUSE WE HAVE FORTY

02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:49.608
OPENINGS IN OUR ORGANIZATION.

02:15:49.674 --> 02:15:51.576
SO IT'S IT'S A BIG PROBLEM THE

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:53.011
OTHER THING I WANTED TO COMMENT

02:15:53.078 --> 02:15:53.979
ON WAS THE MINIMUM WAGE.

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:57.549
AND IT FELT LIKE IF THE

02:15:57.616 --> 02:16:00.185
DISCUSSION WAS AROUND.

02:16:00.252 --> 02:16:02.554
OUR INDUSTRY BEING A MINIMUM

02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:04.089
WAGE INDUSTRY IT'S NOT.

02:16:04.155 --> 02:16:05.423
AND WE HAVE THAT STILL SORRY WE

02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:06.825
HAVE SKILLED PEOPLE WE NEED TO

02:16:06.892 --> 02:16:08.059
THINK OF IT AS A MUCH HIGHER

02:16:08.126 --> 02:16:09.561
THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE INDUSTRY

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:11.830
WE HAVE NEVER ONCE APPLIED FOR

02:16:11.897 --> 02:16:13.298
THE MINIMUM WAGE ADJUSTMENT.

02:16:13.365 --> 02:16:14.499
NOT BECAUSE OF LOCAL MINIMUM

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:16.101
WAGE BUT BECAUSE WE CAN'T PAY

02:16:16.167 --> 02:16:17.235
ANYBODY MINIMAL WHICH WE HAVE TO

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:18.637
PAY MORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I LOST FIVE

BUT BEYOND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

02:17:14.759 --> 02:17:16.695

02:37:27.271 --> 02:37:28.438
GENEROUS AND RESTORED.

02:37:28.505 --> 02:37:31.041
OR REMOVE THE CAP ON RESPITE I'M

02:37:31.108 --> 02:37:32.376
I KNOW THAT IT WAS A TOUGH

02:37:32.442 --> 02:37:34.077
CHOICE BETWEEN RESPITE SOCIAL

02:37:34.144 --> 02:37:34.812
RECORD THE TIME.

02:37:34.878 --> 02:37:37.381
AND I THE LEGISLATURE I'M AND

02:37:37.447 --> 02:37:38.816
THE GOVERNOR READ THE CHOICE OF

02:37:38.882 --> 02:37:41.485
OF RESPITE WE IN OUR WE HAVEN'T

02:37:41.552 --> 02:37:43.353
DONE A FULL STUDY BUT WE IN OUR

02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:45.055
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE RESPITE HAS

02:37:45.122 --> 02:37:46.890
ACTUALLY NOT REALLY BENEFITED.

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:48.091
THE COMMUNITIES AND LIKE WE

02:37:48.158 --> 02:37:49.760
THOUGHT THEY WHAT -- WHILE THE

02:37:49.827 --> 02:37:51.061
CAP WAS LIFTED PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:37:51.128 --> 02:37:52.796
ACTUALLY GETTING A SIGNIFICANT

02:37:52.863 --> 02:37:55.265
INCREASE IN A RESPITE SO IT

02:37:55.332 --> 02:37:56.700
HASN'T HAD A MAJOR BENEFIT.

02:37:56.767 --> 02:37:58.635
SOCIAL WRAPPED IT WILL HAVE THAT

02:37:58.702 --> 02:38:00.871
BENEFIT THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION

02:38:00.938 --> 02:38:02.406
THE SECOND POINT I WANTED TO

02:38:02.472 --> 02:38:05.409
MAKE IS THAT -- WE ALSO REALLY

02:38:05.475 --> 02:38:07.344
ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT

02:38:07.411 --> 02:38:10.047
RESTORING NON MEDICAL THERAPIES

02:38:10.113 --> 02:38:10.948
IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF

02:38:11.014 --> 02:38:13.217
MONEY THAT VERY NARROW GROUP OF

02:38:13.283 --> 02:38:14.218
OF THERAPIES.

02:38:14.284 --> 02:38:15.853
BUT WHAT IT INCLUDES ARE THINGS

02:38:15.919 --> 02:38:18.755
LIKE ECHOING THERAPY SO INSTEAD

02:38:18.822 --> 02:38:19.623
OF JUST GOING ON HORSEBACK

02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:21.625
RIDING YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING

02:38:21.692 --> 02:38:22.826
THERAPEUTIC IMPLIED.

02:38:22.893 --> 02:38:24.561
I'M ABLE ALSO INCLUDES THINGS

02:38:24.628 --> 02:38:26.296
LIKE NEUROLOGIC MUSIC THERAPY

02:38:26.363 --> 02:38:28.465
WHICH HAS BEEN GREATLY BENEFITED

02:38:28.532 --> 02:38:31.501
MY SON SO -- I HOPE THAT YOU'LL

LONG LINE HERE WHICH I THINK

02:38:46.183 --> 02:38:47.618
SPEAKS TOWARD THE IMPORTANT

02:38:47.684 --> 02:38:50.120
STUFF AND THE EYES ON THE ISSUES

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:51.588

FOR THOSE WE SERVE.

02:39:01.398 --> 02:39:03.100

02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:01.438
OF THE MOST.

02:48:01.504 --> 02:48:02.772
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WERE

02:48:02.839 --> 02:48:04.507
SEEN IN OUR SYSTEM IS A GROWTH

02:48:04.574 --> 02:48:07.143
AND CHILDREN -- WITH AUTISM AND

02:48:07.210 --> 02:48:08.845
THOSE CHILDREN ARE ALSO AGING

02:48:08.912 --> 02:48:10.547
AND GETTING OLDER AND THE NEEDS

02:48:10.613 --> 02:48:11.948
OF OUR SYSTEM IS CERTAINLY

CHANGING AS A RESULT.

02:48:13.316 --> 02:48:15.084
OF NOTE TO OUR TOTAL POPULATION

02:48:15.151 --> 02:48:16.853
CURRENTLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH

02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:19.022
AUTISM IS A HUNDRED TWELVE

02:48:19.088 --> 02:48:21.491
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS.

02:48:21.558 --> 02:48:23.359
OF THIS POPULAR AN 80% OF THEM

02:48:23.426 --> 02:48:24.394
ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO

02:48:24.461 --> 02:48:25.762
JUST TO DRIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT

02:48:25.829 --> 02:48:27.464
DEEPER IS THAT WHEN WE TAKE A

02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:28.898
LOOK AT OUR POPULATION.

02:48:28.965 --> 02:48:31.434
BETWEEN THE AGE OF BETWEEN THREE

02:48:31.501 --> 02:48:34.804
AND 2160% OF THEM HAVE A

02:48:34.871 --> 02:48:37.106
DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM -- MOST

02:48:37.173 --> 02:48:38.575
NOTABLY IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE

02:48:38.641 --> 02:48:40.710
AGE OF SIX TO NINE YEARS OLD AND

02:48:40.777 --> 02:48:41.611
SO AGAIN.

02:48:41.678 --> 02:48:42.745
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT WHEN WE

02:48:42.812 --> 02:48:44.347
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS WE TAKE A

02:48:44.414 --> 02:48:45.415
LOOK AT THE CHANGES OF OUR

02:48:45.482 --> 02:48:47.317
DEMOGRAPHICS AS FAR AS ETHNICITY

02:48:47.383 --> 02:48:48.885
OF OUR POPULATION?

02:48:48.952 --> 02:48:50.753
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR HISPANIC

02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:53.490
POPULATION IN -- TWO THOUSAND

02:48:53.556 --> 02:48:55.291
EIGHT IT REPRESENTED 34% OF OUR

02:48:55.358 --> 02:48:57.427
POPULATION -- CONSUMER

02:48:57.494 --> 02:48:59.395
POPULATION WHERE AS WHITES WAS

02:48:59.462 --> 02:49:00.763
39%.

02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:02.031
AND CURRENTLY ARE HISPANIC

02:49:02.098 --> 02:49:05.068
POPULATION NOW REPRESENTS 39%

02:49:05.134 --> 02:49:06.903
WHERE WHITES IS 31%.

02:49:06.970 --> 02:49:08.238
SO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT ALSO

02:49:08.304 --> 02:49:09.906
OUR AGING POPULATION THAT IS

02:49:09.973 --> 02:49:11.307
ALSO CHANGING.

02:49:11.374 --> 02:49:13.409
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT AS WE TAKE

02:49:13.476 --> 02:49:14.611
A LOOK AT OUR HEADQUARTERS?

02:49:14.677 --> 02:49:16.579
WE ARE A SYSTEM THAT HAS CHANGED

02:49:16.646 --> 02:49:18.114
WHAT I'M LOOKING AT HOW WE

02:49:18.181 --> 02:49:19.849
PROVIDE THE SERVICES IT WITH A

02:49:19.916 --> 02:49:22.752
TARGETED -- FOCUS AND PRIORITY

OF NOT ONLY ON DELIVERING THE

02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:25.421
SERVICES THROUGH THE REGIONAL

STATEWIDE APPROACH.

02:49:47.243 --> 02:49:48.912
SO WE CAN REALLY MAKE SURE THAT

02:49:48.978 --> 02:49:49.913
AS FAMILIES ARE HAVING

02:49:49.979 --> 02:49:51.581
EXPERIENCES WITHIN ONE REGIONAL

02:49:51.648 --> 02:49:53.016
CENTER CATCHMENT AREA.

02:49:53.082 --> 02:49:54.517
THAT THOSE EXPERIENCES COULD BE

02:49:54.584 --> 02:49:56.452
FOUND IN ANOTHER AREA HOW DO WE

02:49:56.519 --> 02:49:58.288
DO THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE

02:49:58.354 --> 02:50:00.056
NEED TO DO IS A A DEPARTMENT IS

02:50:00.123 --> 02:50:01.424
ALSO BE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE

02:50:01.491 --> 02:50:03.993
NEEDS -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FOUR

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:05.762
LAYERS ON THAT WORK WITH THE

02:50:05.828 --> 02:50:07.163
TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS --

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:09.599
THE PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE THAT

02:50:09.666 --> 02:50:11.134
OUR RELATIONSHIP TO WHERE WE

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:13.102
WOULD HAVE SEVEN TEAMS THAT

02:50:13.169 --> 02:50:14.037
WOULD WORK WITH A DIFFERENT

02:50:14.103 --> 02:50:16.205
REGIONAL CENTERS SO WE WOULD NOW

02:50:16.272 --> 02:50:18.608
HAVE -- ONE LAY IS ON WITH

02:50:18.675 --> 02:50:20.944
SUPPORT THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:50:21.010 --> 02:50:22.645
WORK WITH THREE REGIONAL CENTERS.

02:50:22.712 --> 02:50:23.947
ONE THING THAT IS VERY NOTABLE I

02:50:24.013 --> 02:50:25.648
THINK IN THE PROPOSAL THAT WE

02:50:25.715 --> 02:50:27.617
HAVE FOR A REORGANIZATION IS

02:50:27.684 --> 02:50:28.618
REALLY HAVING A PRESENCE IN

02:50:28.685 --> 02:50:30.853
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALSO AND IN

02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:32.088
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:50:32.155 --> 02:50:33.356
SO WHAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO

02:50:33.423 --> 02:50:35.458
OVER TIME IS TO BE HAD ABLE TO

02:50:35.525 --> 02:50:36.859
HAVE BETWEEN FORTY FIVE AND

02:50:36.926 --> 02:50:37.961
FIFTY OF OUR STAFF IN SOUTHERN

02:50:38.027 --> 02:50:39.228
CALIFORNIA.

02:50:39.295 --> 02:50:42.398
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO

02:50:42.465 --> 02:50:43.433
ATTEND.

02:50:43.499 --> 02:50:44.200
ANY OF THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:45.435
MEETINGS WELL IN THE LAST YEAR

02:50:45.501 --> 02:50:47.437
WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE ABOUT

02:50:47.503 --> 02:50:48.304
THIRTY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER

02:50:48.371 --> 02:50:50.073
MEETINGS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:51.741
WAS REALLY BENEFICIAL WAS THAT

02:50:51.808 --> 02:50:54.344
WE DID HAVE STAFF THAT ATTENDED.

02:50:54.410 --> 02:50:55.578
AT LEAST ONE OF THE OF THE

02:50:55.645 --> 02:50:57.046
PUBLIC MEETINGS AT EACH REGIONAL

02:50:57.113 --> 02:50:59.616
CENTER HAD TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

02:50:59.682 --> 02:51:01.150
DISPARITY ISSUES.

02:51:01.217 --> 02:51:01.718
YOU KNOW THEY WERE ABLE TO

02:51:01.784 --> 02:51:02.652
ATTEND.

02:51:02.719 --> 02:51:03.820
ONE IF WE HAD A PRESENCE

02:51:03.886 --> 02:51:04.654
THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN

02:51:04.721 --> 02:51:06.022
INCREASED ARE STOCKING WE WOULD

02:51:06.089 --> 02:51:07.490
BE ABLE TO ATTEND MORE THE

02:51:07.557 --> 02:51:08.358
COMMUNITY MEETINGS.

02:51:08.424 --> 02:51:09.826
NOT TO GET IN THE WAY OF WHAT

02:51:09.892 --> 02:51:11.694
THE WORK IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:51:11.761 --> 02:51:12.295
BECAUSE THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT

02:51:12.362 --> 02:51:13.396
OUR INTENT.

02:51:13.463 --> 02:51:14.797
BUT WE CAN REALLY START TAKING A

02:51:14.864 --> 02:51:16.499
LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE ISUES THAT

02:51:16.566 --> 02:51:18.234
WE'RE HEARING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:51:18.301 --> 02:51:20.236
TIE THAT BACK UP TO THE POLICY

02:51:20.303 --> 02:51:21.671
AND INITIATIVES THAT WERE DOING

02:51:21.738 --> 02:51:22.939
AT THE STATE LEVEL.

02:51:23.006 --> 02:51:24.974
AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN WE WERE --

02:51:25.041 --> 02:51:26.476
DISBURSING ELEVEN MILLION FOR

02:51:26.542 --> 02:51:29.746
DISPARITY FUNDS OR WITH THE

02:51:29.812 --> 02:51:31.514
FIFTEEN MILLION THAT WE HAVE.

02:51:31.581 --> 02:51:34.117
FOR THE H. CBS -- COMPLIANCE

02:51:34.183 --> 02:51:35.852
FUNDING WHEN WE HAVE COMMUNITY

02:51:35.918 --> 02:51:37.654
PLACEMENT FUNDS AS WELL AS

02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:38.755
COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT

02:51:38.821 --> 02:51:41.057
FUNDS ALL OF THAT THE DECISIONS

02:51:41.124 --> 02:51:42.258
THAT WERE MAKING FOR ALL OF THEM

02:51:42.325 --> 02:51:44.060
VESTMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:51:44.127 --> 02:51:45.161
IS DOING.

02:51:45.228 --> 02:51:46.696
REALLY CAN'T BE TIED TO

02:51:46.763 --> 02:51:48.297
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS HAPPENING

02:51:48.364 --> 02:51:49.532
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:51:49.599 --> 02:51:50.800
SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS I THINK

02:51:50.867 --> 02:51:52.468
IS IS REALLY CRITICAL IN BEING

02:51:52.535 --> 02:51:54.303
ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE ONE OF

02:51:54.370 --> 02:51:55.505
THINGS THAT WE HAVE A WANTED TO

02:51:55.571 --> 02:51:57.707
DO WAS IMPROVE OUR RESPONSES TO

02:51:57.774 --> 02:52:00.510
INFORMAL COMPLAINTS TO FAMILIES --

02:52:00.576 --> 02:52:01.878
AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE A

02:52:01.944 --> 02:52:04.013
PRESENCE BROADER THROUGHOUT

02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:06.983
CALIFORNIA -- OUR RESPONSE TO

02:52:07.050 --> 02:52:08.518
BEING ABLE TO GET OUT WE HAD A A

02:52:08.584 --> 02:52:10.553
CONCERN THAT WAS SHARED IN A

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:11.988
PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

02:52:12.055 --> 02:52:13.690
IT WAS A IMPORTANT CONCERN IT

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:14.824
WAS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY

02:52:14.891 --> 02:52:16.159
WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE FAMILIES

02:52:16.225 --> 02:52:18.027
IT WAS A PARTICULAR CONCERN TO

02:52:18.094 --> 02:52:19.228
AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

02:52:19.295 --> 02:52:21.164
YOU KNOW BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

02:52:21.230 --> 02:52:22.498
THERE IS USED THE FAMILIES WERE

02:52:22.565 --> 02:52:23.299
SAYING THAT THEY WERE NOT

02:52:23.366 --> 02:52:25.301
GETTING SERVICES WE NEEDED TO

02:52:25.368 --> 02:52:26.102
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ISSUES

02:52:26.169 --> 02:52:26.736
WERE.

02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:28.571
IT TOOK US SEVERAL MONTHS TO BE

02:52:28.638 --> 02:52:30.139
ABLE TO HAVE SOMEBODY WITH AN

02:52:30.206 --> 02:52:31.941
HEADQUARTERS TO GO OUT AND BE

02:52:32.008 --> 02:52:33.076
THERE TO LISTEN TO WHAT THOSE

02:52:33.142 --> 02:52:35.078
CONCERNS WERE SO WE CAN PROVIDE

02:52:35.144 --> 02:52:36.512
SOME ASSISTANCE TO THE REGIONAL

02:52:36.579 --> 02:52:38.581
CENTER. TO SEE HOW WE CAN --

02:52:38.648 --> 02:52:40.183
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MITIGATE

02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:43.252
THAT RISK.

02:52:43.319 --> 02:52:43.886
AND THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK

02:52:43.953 --> 02:52:44.554
IS REALLY A POURTANT AND WHEN WE

02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:45.054
TAKE A LOOK AT THE RISK

02:52:45.121 --> 02:52:45.588
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH IN

02:52:45.655 --> 02:52:46.689
CALIFORNIA.

02:52:46.756 --> 02:52:48.024
YOU KNOW AGAIN OUR SYSTEM IS

02:52:48.091 --> 02:52:49.959
GROWING SO WHEN WE ARE ARE

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:52.261
BUILDING THE SERVICES FOR

02:52:52.328 --> 02:52:53.396
SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH VERY

02:52:53.463 --> 02:52:55.498
COMPLEX NEEDS AS WERE SUPPORTING

02:52:55.565 --> 02:52:57.467
SERVICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

02:52:57.533 --> 02:52:59.135
WELL WE DO HAVE A QUALITY

02:52:59.202 --> 02:53:01.070
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE DO HAVE

02:53:01.137 --> 02:53:02.905
STAFF THAT WORK IN THAT ENHANCE

02:53:02.972 --> 02:53:04.040
THE MESS AND BRINGING IN

02:53:04.107 --> 02:53:05.241
SOMEBODY THAT CAN HAVE THAT

02:53:05.308 --> 02:53:07.477
EXPERTISE THAT UNDERSTANDS RISK

02:53:07.543 --> 02:53:10.246
MANAGEMENT AND A VERY --

02:53:10.313 --> 02:53:11.981
PASSIONATE LEVEL BUT ALSO WITH

02:53:12.048 --> 02:53:13.816
THE EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO HELP

02:53:13.883 --> 02:53:15.685
US ASSESS HOW ARE WE DOING AS A

02:53:15.752 --> 02:53:16.619
STATE.

02:53:16.686 --> 02:53:17.487
IN UNDERSTANDING OUR RISK

02:53:17.553 --> 02:53:20.690
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND HOW WECAN MOVE FORWARD AND BE ABLE TO

02:53:20.757 --> 02:53:22.492
HAVE A VERY CLEAR PLAN SO WE CAN

02:53:22.558 --> 02:53:23.292
HELP.

02:53:23.359 --> 02:53:25.128
GOING TO MITIGATE RISK -- BY

02:53:25.194 --> 02:53:26.963
UNDERSTANDING OR TRANS THE

02:53:27.029 --> 02:53:28.965
QUESTION THAT WAS ALSO IN THE

02:53:29.031 --> 02:53:30.666
AGENDA FOR US TODAY WAS HOW CAN

02:53:30.733 --> 02:53:31.801
RESEARCH.

02:53:31.868 --> 02:53:33.736
ON BE ABLE TO KIND OF ADDRESS

02:53:33.803 --> 02:53:35.872
SOME OF THE THE DATA CONCERNS

02:53:35.938 --> 02:53:37.140
ARE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE

02:53:37.206 --> 02:53:38.441
THOSE UNMET NEEDS.

02:53:38.508 --> 02:53:40.143
AS I HAD TALKED JUST A SECOND

02:53:40.209 --> 02:53:41.711
AGO ABOUT THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE

02:53:41.778 --> 02:53:43.613
DEVELOPMENT -- PLANS ONE OF THE

02:53:43.679 --> 02:53:44.814
THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT

02:53:44.881 --> 02:53:45.915
THE REGIONAL CENTERS UNDERSTAND

02:53:45.982 --> 02:53:48.217
WHAT THEIR LOCAL NEEDS ARE WHAT

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:49.585
WERE THE GAPS OF SERVICES ARE

02:53:49.652 --> 02:53:51.254
THEY CAN REQUEST.

02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:53.122
FUNDING RELATED TO THAT WELL

02:53:53.189 --> 02:53:55.191
THAT IS NOT THE VISIBILITY THAT

02:53:55.258 --> 02:53:56.893
WE HAVE -- AT THE DEPARTMENT

02:53:56.959 --> 02:53:58.161
LEVEL AS FAR AS UNDERSTANDING

02:53:58.227 --> 02:53:59.862
KIND OF THOSE THAT LEVEL OF

02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:01.731
DETAIL ENHANCING OUR RESEARCH

02:54:01.798 --> 02:54:04.233
SECTION REALLY CAN HELP US.

02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:06.602
START IDENTIFYING WHAT ARE SOME

02:54:06.669 --> 02:54:07.570
OF THE DATA ELEMENTS ARE WHAT

02:54:07.637 --> 02:54:09.539
ARE SOME OF THE DATE THAT THE

02:54:09.605 --> 02:54:11.474
ABILITY TO DO DATA MEASURES THAT

02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:13.109
WILL HELP US BROAD AND AN

02:54:13.176 --> 02:54:14.477
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE ARE GAPS

02:54:14.544 --> 02:54:15.645
THE SERVICES ARE OR

02:54:15.711 --> 02:54:17.847
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S DRIVING OUR

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:19.382
TRENDS AND AND CHANGES.

02:54:19.448 --> 02:54:20.883
AND THAT SECTION THAT RESEARCH

02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:21.918
SECTION WITH THE ADDITIONAL

02:54:21.984 --> 02:54:24.153
STAFFING WILL BE ABLE TO ALSO

02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:25.788
TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE DATA

02:54:25.855 --> 02:54:27.390
INTEGRITY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE.

02:54:27.456 --> 02:54:30.993
AND THEN WORKING WITH THE-REGIONAL CENTERS -- AS FAR AS

02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:32.728
THE EFFORTS THAT THEY HAVE SO

02:54:32.795 --> 02:54:33.663
CAN A COLLECTIVE WHEN NO IT'S A

02:54:33.729 --> 02:54:35.097
LOT OF INFORMATION BUT I WANTED

02:54:35.164 --> 02:54:37.200
TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN GIVE YOU.

02:54:37.266 --> 02:54:38.634
SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES THAT

02:54:38.701 --> 02:54:43.306
WERE SEEN AS A SYSTEM AND AND

02:54:43.372 --> 02:54:43.906
THE APPROACH THAT WE WOULD BE

02:54:43.973 --> 02:54:45.308
USING WITHIN RE ORGANIZATION TO

02:54:45.374 --> 02:54:45.908
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES.

02:54:45.975 --> 02:54:46.876
ONE OF THE THE THINGS YOU WAS

02:54:46.943 --> 02:54:49.545
ALSO NOTED -- AS FAR AS WHAT IS

02:54:49.612 --> 02:54:51.380
GOING TO BE THE THE PRIMARY

02:54:51.447 --> 02:54:53.382
FOCUS OF SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS

02:54:53.449 --> 02:54:54.717
AND THE OUTCOMES AND HOW CAN

02:54:54.784 --> 02:54:56.052
THIS BENEFIT CONSUMERS AND

02:54:56.118 --> 02:54:57.086
FAMILIES.

02:54:57.153 --> 02:54:58.721
AS I SAID YOU KNOW CERTAINLY

02:54:58.788 --> 02:54:59.755
SUPPORTING THE REGIONAL CENTERS

02:54:59.822 --> 02:55:00.690

ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS IT'S

02:55:02.058 --> 02:55:04.627
IMPORTANT BUT ALSO FOR US IS A

02:55:04.694 --> 02:55:06.162
DEPARTMENT TO UNDERSTAND SO WE

02:55:06.229 --> 02:55:07.964
CAN ALSO MAKE SOME -- IMPORTANT

02:55:08.030 --> 02:55:10.099
DECISIONS THE OUTCOMES ALSO

02:55:10.166 --> 02:55:10.933
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:12.335
THE BEST DECISIONS TO THE

02:55:12.401 --> 02:55:14.003
INVESTMENT OF THE DOLLARS THAT

02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:15.438
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

02:55:15.504 --> 02:55:17.240
MINISTRATION HAS COMMITTED. TO

02:55:17.306 --> 02:55:18.674
TO AFFECT THOSE CHANGES

02:55:18.741 --> 02:55:19.976
ADDITIONALLY WHEN WE'RE TAKING A

02:55:20.042 --> 02:55:22.445
LOOK AT ENHANCING OUR MONITORING

02:55:22.511 --> 02:55:23.946

THAT ALSO WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A

02:55:33.422 --> 02:55:34.991
DIRECT BENEFIT TO INDIVIDUALS --

02:55:35.057 --> 02:55:37.426
THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR

02:55:37.493 --> 02:55:38.060
SERVICES.

SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

02:55:39.662 --> 02:55:42.865
QUESTIONS -- THAT -- MAYBE.

BURGEONING JUST SAID ABOUT THE

02:57:06.882 --> 02:57:08.718
THE RESEARCH UNIT BUT WE WOULD

02:57:08.784 --> 02:57:10.786
JUST NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:57:10.853 --> 02:57:13.422

02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:16.525
DATA IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO

02:57:16.592 --> 02:57:18.194
UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE GAPS

02:57:18.260 --> 02:57:20.363
IN SERVICES NEEDS ARE.

02:57:20.429 --> 02:57:21.897

LIKE THESE SERVICES SO IT'S IT'S

02:57:45.521 --> 02:57:46.756
HARD TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF

02:57:46.822 --> 02:57:48.891
STRATEGIC DECISIONS WITHOUT THAT

02:57:48.958 --> 02:57:50.726

02:57:50.793 --> 02:57:51.994
STATEWIDE.

02:57:52.061 --> 02:57:53.796
SYSTEMATIC LEVEL AND THEN

02:57:53.863 --> 02:57:55.197
FINALLY JUST A SMALL POINT

02:57:55.264 --> 02:57:57.666
REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO TO

02:57:57.733 --> 02:57:59.135

IT BECAME A UNIFIED SYSTEM WHERE

02:59:33.362 --> 02:59:34.763

02:59:44.974 --> 02:59:46.175

COMPLEX.

03:00:20.176 --> 03:00:22.645
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT ALL THREE

03:00:22.711 --> 03:00:24.313
SEGMENTS OF THE SYSTEM SERVICE

03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:26.015

RESOURCES TO DO THEIR JOB.

03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:32.388
AND IN RECENT YEARS THE

BUT ALSO TO REGIONAL CENTERS

03:00:43.032 --> 03:00:45.034
WHICH HAS MADE IT HARDER TO

03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:47.036

KINDS OF THINGS.

03:00:52.741 --> 03:00:55.010
AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS

03:00:55.077 --> 03:00:56.478
PROPOSAL MOVING FORWARD IN

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW STANDARDS

03:01:12.795 --> 03:01:13.996
THAT WOULD REQUIRE GREATER

03:01:14.063 --> 03:01:15.397
COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND WE

03:01:15.464 --> 03:01:18.200

03:02:30.973 --> 03:02:32.508
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

03:02:32.574 --> 03:02:34.510
BUT WE ARE STILL UNCLEAR ABOUT

03:02:34.576 --> 03:02:36.111
HOW THIS ADDITIONAL A POINT ONE

03:02:36.178 --> 03:02:37.413
MILLION DOLLARS IN.

03:02:37.479 --> 03:02:38.147
FIFTY FOUR POSITIONS WILL

03:02:38.213 --> 03:02:40.249
IMPROVE OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO

03:02:40.316 --> 03:02:41.617
OUR COMMUNITY.

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:43.152
WILL THIS RESTRUCTURING CHANGE

03:02:43.218 --> 03:02:44.753
THE FACT THAT SIMILAR

03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:46.422
INDIVIDUALS READ WILL STILL

03:02:46.488 --> 03:02:48.657
RECEIVE VASTLY DIFFERENT LEVELS

03:02:48.724 --> 03:02:50.459
OF SERVICE DEPENDING ON WHICH

03:02:50.526 --> 03:02:51.860
REGIONAL CENTER THEY ARE PART OF

03:02:51.927 --> 03:02:53.195
WILL THESE FUNDS ENSURE THAT THE

03:02:53.262 --> 03:02:54.296
INCREDIBLY DELAYED SELF

03:02:54.363 --> 03:02:56.699
DETERMINATION PROGRAM FINALLY

03:02:56.765 --> 03:02:58.067
BEGINS IT IS SUCCESSFUL.

03:02:58.133 --> 03:03:00.135
WILL THESE EXTRA POSITIONS MAKE

03:03:00.202 --> 03:03:01.003
SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH

03:03:01.070 --> 03:03:02.671
DISABILITIES GET JOBS AND CAN

03:03:02.738 --> 03:03:05.307
REMAIN AT HOME EVEN IF THEY'RE

03:03:05.374 --> 03:03:07.943
STRUGGLING THROUGH CRISIS.

03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:09.111
HOW WILL THE OR -- HOW THE

03:03:09.178 --> 03:03:09.945
REORGANIZATION ENSURE THAT

03:03:10.012 --> 03:03:11.914
PEOPLE WHO ARE LATINO ARE

03:03:11.980 --> 03:03:13.549
GETTING THE SAME LEVEL OF

03:03:13.615 --> 03:03:15.117
SERVICES PEOPLE WHO ARE WHITE --

03:03:15.184 --> 03:03:17.419
HOW WILL THIS HELP PEOPLE

03:03:17.486 --> 03:03:19.488
FAMILIES WHO FEEL INTIMIDATED TO

03:03:19.555 --> 03:03:22.725
ASK FOR SERVICES FROM THEIR

03:03:22.791 --> 03:03:24.393
REGIONAL CENTRES?

03:03:24.460 --> 03:03:25.794
YOU MAY ASK WHAT ONE ADDING

03:03:25.861 --> 03:03:26.395
FIFTY FOUR NEW POSITIONS BRING

03:03:26.462 --> 03:03:28.497
ABOUT PROGRESS IN ALL OF THESE

03:03:28.564 --> 03:03:29.531
FRONTS I MEAN AFTER ALL.

03:03:29.598 --> 03:03:31.867
DDS IS PROPOSING TO HIRE TWENTY

03:03:31.934 --> 03:03:33.235
FIVE MORE PEOPLE TO FUNCTION AS

03:03:38.173 --> 03:03:39.842
WE CARE ABOUT WELL UNFORTUNATELY

03:03:39.908 --> 03:03:42.511
THE ANSWER IS NOT NECESSARILY.

03:03:42.578 --> 03:03:44.046
IF THE NEW STAFF OR NOT EMPOWER

03:03:44.113 --> 03:03:45.981
TO SOLVE SYSTEMIC ISSUES AND

03:03:46.048 --> 03:03:47.883
INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS THEY WILL

03:03:47.950 --> 03:03:50.052
MOSTLY JUST FEED INFORMATION UP

03:03:50.119 --> 03:03:51.854
THE FOOD CHAIN AND NOTHING WILL

03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:52.654
CHANGE.

03:03:52.721 --> 03:03:53.956
IF THE ADDITIONAL STAFF OR NOT

03:03:54.022 --> 03:03:55.023
WELL EQUIPPED TO IDENTIFY

03:03:55.090 --> 03:03:56.525

03:04:03.031 --> 03:04:04.133
CHANGE.

03:04:04.199 --> 03:04:05.000
SO HOW WILL WE KNOW FOR

03:04:05.067 --> 03:04:06.235
RESTRUCTURING PLAN IS ACTUALLY

03:04:06.301 --> 03:04:08.837
WORKING WELL FIRST WE NEED TO

03:04:08.904 --> 03:04:10.439

HOLD THE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:04:13.675 --> 03:04:14.676
ACHIEVING THAT.

03:04:14.743 --> 03:04:15.911
INSTEAD OF JUST FOCUSING ON

03:04:15.978 --> 03:04:17.713
PUTTING IN MORE POSITIONS AND

03:04:17.780 --> 03:04:19.581
MORE FUNDING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

03:04:19.648 --> 03:04:20.649
HOW THIS APPROPRIATION WILL

03:04:20.716 --> 03:04:23.018
AFFECT THE OUTCOMES THAT MATTER

03:04:23.085 --> 03:04:23.786
TO US.

03:04:23.852 --> 03:04:24.787
WE NEED TO ASK HOW MUCH

03:04:24.853 --> 03:04:26.355
IMPROVEMENT CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE

03:04:26.422 --> 03:04:27.623
AND BY WHAT DATE.

03:04:27.689 --> 03:04:28.757

03:04:30.159 --> 03:04:31.393
ADVANCE.

03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:32.561
SECOND WE SHOULD ASK THE

03:04:32.628 --> 03:04:34.029
DEPARTMENT TO REPORT BACK

03:04:34.096 --> 03:04:35.597

WE PROVIDED SOME OF THESE IDEAS

03:04:38.467 --> 03:04:40.502
TO YOUR COMMITTEE AND FINALLY

03:04:40.569 --> 03:04:42.104
ANY SIGNIFICANT REORGANIZATION

03:04:42.171 --> 03:04:43.705
SHOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL

03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:45.441
REFORMS THAT PROVIDE FOR MORE

03:04:45.507 --> 03:04:47.409

MY SON AND OTHERS LIKE HIM --

OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND

03:05:19.208 --> 03:05:21.009
TRANSPARENCY IN THE

03:05:21.076 --> 03:05:22.511

REGIONAL CENTERS -- I THINK THE

03:05:41.997 --> 03:05:44.299
RESTRUCTURE REALLY DOES REFLECT

03:05:44.366 --> 03:05:46.568
THE CHANGE IN HOW THE DEPARTMENT

03:05:46.635 --> 03:05:47.903

IS COME UP WITH CLICK CLEAR

03:06:09.525 --> 03:06:10.626

WE WERE ABLE TO POST THOSE FOR

03:07:09.685 --> 03:07:11.353
ALL SERVICES THAT WOULD GIVE.

03:07:11.420 --> 03:07:12.154
THE PUBLIC ADDITIONAL

03:07:12.220 --> 03:07:13.388
INFORMATION SO THAT THEY COULD

03:07:13.455 --> 03:07:14.790
BETTER PREPARE FOR A P. P.

03:07:14.856 --> 03:07:16.558
MEETINGS AND WORKING WITH THE

03:07:16.625 --> 03:07:17.993
REGIONAL CENTER WORKERS.

03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:20.329

THE END OF AN I. P. P. MEETING.

03:07:26.802 --> 03:07:28.537
IN ORDER FOR AYE PP SERVICES TO

03:07:28.604 --> 03:07:30.339
BEGAN THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS TO

03:07:30.405 --> 03:07:31.573
HAVE A CONSENT FOR SERVICES

03:07:31.640 --> 03:07:34.543
SIGNED BY THE CONSUMER OR FAMILY

03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:36.445
IF THEY'RE MINORS -- WHAT

03:07:36.511 --> 03:07:39.014
HAPPENS NOW IS THAT IN MANY

03:07:39.081 --> 03:07:41.083
REGIONAL CENTERS THE SERVICE

03:07:41.149 --> 03:07:42.451

HER OFFICE DRAFTS AN I. P. P.?

03:07:46.355 --> 03:07:47.956
THE I. P. P. IS SUPPOSED TO BE

STRUCTURING GOING TO ACTUALLY

03:09:01.997 --> 03:09:03.598
LEAD TO CHANGE FOR THE ACTUAL

MAYBE CAN GET A MORE SPECIFIC

03:09:08.270 --> 03:09:10.238
ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

03:09:10.305 --> 03:09:11.339
WERE RAISED.

03:09:11.406 --> 03:09:13.809
NO THANK YOU SENATOR -- WE WHEN

SURE THAT WE REMAIN ENGAGED IN

03:09:17.612 --> 03:09:18.113
THE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR

03:09:18.180 --> 03:09:19.848

MOVING FORWARD.

03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:26.988
AND WHAT SOME OF THE THE

03:09:27.055 --> 03:09:29.624
ELEMENTS WITHIN THE RESTRUCTURE

03:09:29.691 --> 03:09:31.693
THAT MAY NOT HAVE LIKE A DIRECT

03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:33.462
LINK TO OUTCOMES AND MEASURES

03:09:33.528 --> 03:09:35.797
AND OTHERS PROBABLY WOULD -- I

03:09:35.864 --> 03:09:36.698
LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF

03:09:36.765 --> 03:09:38.900
EXAMPLES WITH THE EARLY START

03:09:38.967 --> 03:09:40.669
ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT WE HAVE

03:09:40.736 --> 03:09:42.304
WITH THAT REALLY START PROGRAM.

03:09:42.370 --> 03:09:44.840
WE WOULD BE INCREASE SEEN OUR

03:09:44.906 --> 03:09:46.908
OVERSIGHT OF OUR EARLY START

03:09:46.975 --> 03:09:48.009
GRANT.

03:09:48.076 --> 03:09:50.479
AND MONITORING AS FAR AS WITH

03:09:50.545 --> 03:09:51.713
THE REGIONAL CENTERS.

03:09:51.780 --> 03:09:53.548
AND TO THE SERVICES IS TO

03:09:53.615 --> 03:09:55.383
HOWEVER WE DELIVERING THOSE

03:09:55.450 --> 03:09:57.085
SERVICES NOT ONLY WITHIN THE

03:09:57.152 --> 03:09:57.886
GRANT.

03:09:57.953 --> 03:09:59.488
BUT IT IS ALSO THAN MAKING THE

03:09:59.554 --> 03:10:01.189
DIFFERENCE IN TO THOSE FAMILIES

03:10:01.256 --> 03:10:03.125
LIVES BECAUSE IF THERE ARE --

03:10:03.191 --> 03:10:06.428
ELEMENTS WHERE THERE'S IN NON

03:10:06.495 --> 03:10:08.363
COMPLIANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT WE

03:10:08.430 --> 03:10:10.165
WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE

03:10:10.232 --> 03:10:12.968
ISSUES EARLIER SO. FOR EXAMPLE

03:10:13.034 --> 03:10:14.636
RIGHT NOW WE REVIEW EVERY THREE

03:10:14.703 --> 03:10:16.838
YEARS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE

03:10:16.905 --> 03:10:19.674
REVIEW ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- AS

03:10:19.741 --> 03:10:21.443
AN EXAMPLE WE DID HAVE ONE

03:10:21.510 --> 03:10:23.445
REGIONAL CENTER WHERE WE WERE

03:10:23.512 --> 03:10:26.081
NOTING ON OUR REVIEWS THAT THEY

03:10:26.148 --> 03:10:27.883
WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN

03:10:27.949 --> 03:10:29.284
THE REST OF THE STATE.

03:10:29.351 --> 03:10:31.086
AS FAR AS COMPLIANCE AND BEING

03:10:31.153 --> 03:10:32.821
ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE MARKERS THAT

03:10:32.888 --> 03:10:34.556
ARE CRITICAL TO NOT ONLY

03:10:34.623 --> 03:10:37.359
SERVICES TO BUT TO THE GRANT.

03:10:37.425 --> 03:10:39.661
VERY QUICKLY WE'RE ABLE WITHIN

03:10:39.728 --> 03:10:41.196
YOU KNOW WHILE WE WERE ABLE TO

03:10:41.263 --> 03:10:43.331
MONITOR IT FOR THREE YEARS WHEN

03:10:43.398 --> 03:10:44.699
WE DID FIND OUT WE WERE ABLE TO

03:10:44.766 --> 03:10:45.934
WORK WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER

03:10:46.001 --> 03:10:47.936
THEY QUICKLY -- MADE THE

03:10:48.003 --> 03:10:50.605
CORRECTIONS AND CORRECTED IT AND

03:10:50.672 --> 03:10:51.907
IT TOOK HIM A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

03:10:51.973 --> 03:10:53.008
THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD

03:10:53.074 --> 03:10:54.943
EXAMPLE OF IF WE'RE DOING THE

03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:56.344
MONITORING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

03:10:56.411 --> 03:10:57.445
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE

03:10:57.512 --> 03:10:58.847
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THREE

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:00.982
YEARS. TO SEE THAT THERE'S A A

03:11:01.049 --> 03:11:02.450
PROBLEM OR SOMETHING THAT WERE

03:11:02.517 --> 03:11:04.019
NOT SEEN IN A COMPLIANCE SETS AN

03:11:04.085 --> 03:11:06.655
EXAMPLE HEALTH AND SAFETY --

03:11:06.721 --> 03:11:08.790
REVIEWS WE DO GET A LOT OF

03:11:08.857 --> 03:11:10.425
HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUEST THE

03:11:10.492 --> 03:11:12.394
TIME FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

03:11:12.460 --> 03:11:13.762
TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THOSE AND

03:11:13.829 --> 03:11:15.096
BE RESPONSIVE AND GET THOSE

03:11:15.163 --> 03:11:16.464
RESPONSES BACK TO THE REGIONAL

03:11:16.531 --> 03:11:17.833
CENTERS INTO THE COMMUNITY IS

03:11:17.899 --> 03:11:18.800
REALLY IMPORTANT.

03:11:18.867 --> 03:11:20.335
THAT THOSE ARE VERY TANGIBLE

03:11:20.402 --> 03:11:21.670

03:11:27.008 --> 03:11:27.809
FOR INDIVIDUALS.

03:11:27.876 --> 03:11:29.511
I'M WITHIN THE EARLY START BUT

03:11:29.578 --> 03:11:31.279

03:11:31.346 --> 03:11:33.081
BROADER SCALE -- SO THERE'S

03:11:33.148 --> 03:11:34.349

BUT WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL

03:13:40.075 --> 03:13:41.543
CENTERS IT WOULD BE MONITORING

AS FAR AS THE COMPLIANCE WITH

03:13:43.478 --> 03:13:45.180

THAT IS ALSO PAYING ATTENTION --

03:13:55.023 --> 03:13:56.725
TO THE QUALITY MEASURES THAT ARE

03:13:56.791 --> 03:13:58.526
OCCURRING THERE ONE LAST COMMENT

03:13:58.593 --> 03:13:59.694
IS THAN ON THE QUALITY

03:13:59.761 --> 03:14:02.097
MANAGEMENT SIDE IS THAT WE DO

03:14:02.163 --> 03:14:03.765
HAVE A CONTRACT FOR A NATIONAL

03:14:03.832 --> 03:14:04.899
CORE INDICATORS.

03:14:04.966 --> 03:14:06.968
BY HAVING A VERY FOCUSED WE'RE

03:14:08.503 --> 03:14:11.606
OF THE ANALYSIS AND

03:14:11.673 --> 03:14:13.975
GOING TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM.

03:14:14.042 --> 03:14:15.910
THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE SEEN

03:14:15.977 --> 03:14:16.845
WITHIN THE NATIONAL CORE

03:14:16.911 --> 03:14:19.314
INDICATORS WHICH IS A DIRECT.

03:14:19.381 --> 03:14:21.182

03:14:21.249 --> 03:14:22.684
SATISFACTION OF CONTENT FROM

03:14:22.751 --> 03:14:24.753
CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES SO MAKING

03:14:24.819 --> 03:14:26.755
THAT LINK AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT

03:14:26.821 --> 03:14:28.523
GOING TO BE A SEPARATE SYSTEM.

03:14:28.590 --> 03:14:30.258
IT'S EVERYBODY COMING TOGETHER

03:14:30.325 --> 03:14:31.559
ONE LAST NOTE IS THAT WE'RE

03:14:31.626 --> 03:14:36.731
HAVING IT REPORT TO THE CHIEF

03:14:36.798 --> 03:14:37.632

03:14:37.699 --> 03:14:37.899
RATIONS.

03:14:37.966 --> 03:14:38.566
SO IT WOULD NOT BE REPORTING TO

03:14:38.633 --> 03:14:39.968
PROGRAM SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT

03:14:40.035 --> 03:14:42.570
WE HAVE A SEPARATE OVERSIGHT FOR

03:14:42.637 --> 03:14:44.939
REGIONAL CENTER KIND OF SYSTEM.

03:14:45.006 --> 03:14:46.341

SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE

03:14:51.579 --> 03:14:53.848
VANTAGE POINT WHEN WE'RE TAKING

03:14:53.915 --> 03:14:55.483
A LOOK AT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES.

03:14:55.550 --> 03:14:57.285
AND A NO YOU HAVE A RESEARCH

03:14:57.352 --> 03:14:58.686
UNIT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN

03:14:58.753 --> 03:15:00.388
PREVIOUS HEARINGS AS WELL AND

03:15:00.455 --> 03:15:01.723
THAT AND ON ONE LEVEL OF COURSE

03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:03.892
IS A RESEARCHER MYSELF ALWAYS

03:15:03.958 --> 03:15:05.427
EXCITING TO SEE RICHARD UNIT.

03:15:05.493 --> 03:15:06.694
BUT I THINK THERE WERE SOME

03:15:06.761 --> 03:15:07.962
QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE

03:15:08.029 --> 03:15:10.365
PAST -- AND I NOTE THAT WE ARE

03:15:10.432 --> 03:15:12.167

THAT -- AND DIZZY AND NINE TIMES

03:15:18.506 --> 03:15:20.341
FAVOR RESEARCH UNIT -- I THINK

03:15:20.408 --> 03:15:21.443
BUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

03:15:21.509 --> 03:15:23.111

RESEARCHING AND ARE TO HOW THIS

03:15:27.782 --> 03:15:29.117
TOPICS THAT THEIR FOR

03:15:29.184 --> 03:15:31.186
RESEARCHING FOCUSING ON GONNA

03:15:31.252 --> 03:15:31.853
THEN.

AGENDA BEING SET FOR FOR THIS --

03:15:39.561 --> 03:15:41.229
RESEARCH UNIT.

03:15:41.296 --> 03:15:43.231
THANK YOU AND AS I SAID --

03:15:43.298 --> 03:15:44.833
BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT WHEN WE

03:15:44.899 --> 03:15:46.501
TAKE A LOOK AT OUR RESEARCH

03:15:46.568 --> 03:15:50.105
SECTION AND HOW THEY ARE ABLE --

03:15:50.171 --> 03:15:51.840
TO PRODUCE AND RICK TAKE A LOOK

03:15:51.906 --> 03:15:52.907
AT OUR DATA.

03:15:52.974 --> 03:15:54.742
MUCH OF IT WE ALSO WANT TO TAKE

03:15:54.809 --> 03:15:56.945
A LOOK AT WHERE WHAT IS OUR KIND

03:15:57.011 --> 03:15:59.314
OF MISSING GAPS IN OUR ABILITY

03:15:59.380 --> 03:16:00.648
TO COLLECT THE DATA.

03:16:00.715 --> 03:16:01.883
SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE WOULD

03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:03.251
REALLY WANT THEM TO DO IS TO BE

03:16:03.318 --> 03:16:04.385
ABLE TO TAKE THE TIME TO TAKE A

03:16:04.452 --> 03:16:06.121
STEP BACK AND CUT IT ANALYZE

03:16:06.187 --> 03:16:07.222
WHAT ARE THE SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE

03:16:07.288 --> 03:16:08.656
USING TO COLLECT IT.

03:16:08.723 --> 03:16:10.191
WHAT IS SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S

03:16:10.258 --> 03:16:11.559
GOING TO BE INFORMATIVE TO US

03:16:11.626 --> 03:16:13.461
WORK WITH THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES

03:16:13.528 --> 03:16:15.430
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN

03:16:15.497 --> 03:16:16.698
ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT?

03:16:16.764 --> 03:16:18.266
KIND OF BROADER WHAT'S GOING TO

03:16:18.333 --> 03:16:20.635
BE HELPFUL WE SPEND QUITE A BIT

03:16:20.702 --> 03:16:22.670
OF TIME TAKING -- LOOKING AT

03:16:22.737 --> 03:16:23.771
SOME OF THE WORK WITH THE

03:16:23.838 --> 03:16:25.406
DISPARITY GRANTS BUT I THINK WE

03:16:25.473 --> 03:16:26.908
ALSO NEED TO FOCUS SOME

03:16:26.975 --> 03:16:28.776
ADDITIONAL EFFORTS RIGHT NOW ON

03:16:28.843 --> 03:16:30.211
OUR SAFETY NET.

03:16:30.278 --> 03:16:31.913
SO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT AS

03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:33.581
WERE BUILDING THE SERVICES WHAT

03:16:33.648 --> 03:16:35.316
IS INFORMING US AND LETTING US

03:16:35.383 --> 03:16:36.084
KNOW.

03:16:36.151 --> 03:16:37.585
THAT THOSE ARE THE SERVICES THAT

03:16:37.652 --> 03:16:39.354
ARE NEEDED SO TRACKING AND

03:16:39.420 --> 03:16:40.722
UNDERSTANDING WITH THE A. M.

03:16:40.788 --> 03:16:42.457
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW MODEL

03:16:42.524 --> 03:16:43.391
SO SERVICE WHETHER IT'S ENHANCE

03:16:43.458 --> 03:16:44.726
BE ABLE SUPPORTS HOMES

03:16:44.792 --> 03:16:45.994
COMMUNICATE RICE'S HOMES.

03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:49.531
STATE OPERATED STAR SERVICES ARE.

03:16:49.597 --> 03:16:51.466
MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES HAVE BEEN

03:16:51.533 --> 03:16:52.834
IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE A

03:16:52.901 --> 03:16:58.673
STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW TO SAY HOW

03:16:58.740 --> 03:17:00.475
ARE WE GOING TO SURE THE SUCCESS

03:17:00.542 --> 03:17:01.142
OF THOSE -- AND THEN BE ABLE TO

03:17:01.209 --> 03:17:02.143
EVALUATE HOW WE WOULD REPLICATED

03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.744
IF THAT WOULD BE WARRANTED SO

03:17:02.810 --> 03:17:04.078
AGAIN IT'S TAKING THAT LINK TO

03:17:04.145 --> 03:17:05.413
ASSESSING KIND OF OUR STRUCTURE

03:17:05.480 --> 03:17:06.614
OF DATA.

03:17:06.681 --> 03:17:08.049
TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DOING

03:17:08.116 --> 03:17:09.918
THE ANALYSIS OF THAT TAKING A

03:17:09.984 --> 03:17:11.452
LOOK AT HOW WE CAN START DOING

03:17:11.519 --> 03:17:13.021
THAT MEASURES EARLY ON IS WERE

03:17:13.087 --> 03:17:14.522
IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW.

03:17:14.589 --> 03:17:16.090
MODELS OF SERVICE AND NEW

03:17:16.157 --> 03:17:17.825
INITIATIVES AND THEN ON BEING

03:17:17.892 --> 03:17:19.994
ABLE -- TO REPORT BACK AND AND

03:17:20.061 --> 03:17:22.297
BE ABLE TO INFORM FUTURE POLICY

03:17:22.363 --> 03:17:24.766
DECISIONS OF NEEDED.

03:17:24.832 --> 03:17:27.202
OKAY AND THEN -- I ALSO NOTE

03:17:27.268 --> 03:17:29.337
THAT IN THE DIAGRAM SO BASICALLY

03:17:29.404 --> 03:17:31.639
YOU'RE THE DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO

03:17:31.706 --> 03:17:34.509
HAVE CENTURY A PROGRAM SERVICES

03:17:34.576 --> 03:17:37.378
PEAS SENATE OPERATIONS AND UNDER

03:17:37.445 --> 03:17:37.912
SEPARATE DEBBIE DOCTORS I

03:17:37.979 --> 03:17:38.546
PRESUME.

03:17:38.613 --> 03:17:41.416
AND I THINK YOU DID SPEAK TO

03:17:41.482 --> 03:17:44.285
SOME EXTENT SAMPLE BEFORE TALK

03:17:44.352 --> 03:17:45.653
MY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ARE WE'RE

03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:48.756
TALKING ABOUT A CALL INSURANCE

03:17:48.823 --> 03:17:50.558
AND AND THAT KIND OF MONITORING

03:17:50.625 --> 03:17:52.393
YOU WANT SOME SEPARATION BUT

03:17:52.460 --> 03:17:54.229
SAME TIME I WON YEAH.

03:17:54.295 --> 03:17:55.597
BUT BE SURE WE DON'T HAVE A CELL

03:17:55.663 --> 03:17:56.898
IS ATION BETWEEN THE PROGRAM

03:17:56.965 --> 03:17:58.466
FOLKS IN THE OPERATION FOLKS

03:17:58.533 --> 03:18:00.568
THERE'S ACTUALLY IN MANY WAYS --

03:18:00.635 --> 03:18:02.036
WHILE SOME THERE MAY BE SOME

03:18:02.103 --> 03:18:03.404
OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS BUT IS

03:18:03.471 --> 03:18:05.173
ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT THE

03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:07.208
PROGRAM FOLKS THAT WE DON'T HAVE

03:18:07.275 --> 03:18:09.577
THE OPERATIONS FOLKS RUNNING OFF

03:18:09.644 --> 03:18:11.946
AND DOING THEIR OWN THING -- AND

03:18:12.013 --> 03:18:13.181
THEN DISTRICT CREATING MORE

03:18:13.248 --> 03:18:14.949
BURDENS ON THE CLICK ON THE

03:18:15.016 --> 03:18:17.085
PROGRAM FOLKS BECAUSE IN A WHILE

03:18:17.151 --> 03:18:18.620
SINCE I'M LEGAL I CAN TREAT MORE

03:18:18.686 --> 03:18:19.754
LEGAL THINGS TO DO.

03:18:19.821 --> 03:18:21.990
AT CETERA SO -- DO YOU SPEAK TO

03:18:22.056 --> 03:18:24.792
COORDINATION DALE HOW THE HOUSE

03:18:24.859 --> 03:18:25.660
WE'RE GOING -- TO HI.

03:18:25.727 --> 03:18:28.363
HOW YOU SEE THE TWO DIVISIONS

03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:30.098
AND NOT BECOMING SO AS IT

03:18:30.164 --> 03:18:31.032
RELATES TO YOUR FOR TO COME

03:18:31.099 --> 03:18:32.033
TOGETHER BUT?

03:18:32.100 --> 03:18:33.735
EXACTLY THE TIES THAT YOU SEE TO

03:18:33.801 --> 03:18:35.970
BE SURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF

03:18:36.037 --> 03:18:37.739
THE OPERATIONS FOLKS ARE ARE

03:18:37.805 --> 03:18:41.142
RELEVANT TO THE PROGRAM THANKS

03:18:41.209 --> 03:18:42.076
AND ANYWAYS -- YEAH.

03:18:42.143 --> 03:18:44.979
ABSOLUTELY AND YOU KNOW IT THIS

03:18:45.046 --> 03:18:47.015
ACTUALLY IS AN AREA THAT IS.

03:18:47.081 --> 03:18:48.750
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME YOU KNOW

03:18:48.816 --> 03:18:50.018
WHEN I STARTED THAT THE

03:18:50.084 --> 03:18:51.886
DEPARTMENT AS A DEPUTY DIRECTOR

03:18:51.953 --> 03:18:56.758
AND THEN CERTAINLY COMING AS A

03:18:56.824 --> 03:18:57.725
DIRECTOR.

03:18:57.792 --> 03:18:58.326
I HAD A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

03:18:58.393 --> 03:18:58.960
WHEN I CAME TO THE DEPARTMENT I

03:18:59.027 --> 03:19:00.662
I HAD NOT WORKED -- AT THE

03:19:00.728 --> 03:19:02.964
DEPARTMENT AND SO WHEN I I CAME

03:19:03.031 --> 03:19:04.499
IN IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME

03:19:04.565 --> 03:19:06.534
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE NOT

03:19:06.601 --> 03:19:08.269
WORKING IN SILOS.

03:19:08.336 --> 03:19:09.570
AND SO WE WERE SHARING OF

03:19:09.637 --> 03:19:11.272
INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE

03:19:11.339 --> 03:19:12.874
OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD NOTED

03:19:12.940 --> 03:19:14.208
AND PART OF THAT HAD TO DO WITH

03:19:14.275 --> 03:19:14.909
THE FUNCTION THAT WE'RE

03:19:14.976 --> 03:19:16.177
OPERATING THE DEVELOPMENTAL

03:19:16.244 --> 03:19:17.578
CENTER DIVISIONS.

03:19:17.645 --> 03:19:19.480
THAT WAS VERY SPECIFIC YOU KNOW

03:19:19.547 --> 03:19:21.249
I EIGHT I AM SO PROUD OF THE

03:19:21.316 --> 03:19:22.950
WORK THAT OUR STAFF DO AT THE

03:19:23.017 --> 03:19:24.452
DEVELOPMENTAL CNTERS YOU KNOW

03:19:24.519 --> 03:19:26.888
OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THE

03:19:26.954 --> 03:19:27.455
THICK THE WORK THAT THEY'RE

03:19:27.522 --> 03:19:28.956
DOING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

03:19:29.023 --> 03:19:30.692
I TEASE THEM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

03:19:30.758 --> 03:19:32.627
IS THAT OFTENTIMES WILL SAY TO

03:19:32.694 --> 03:19:34.095
ME OR THEY'LL SAY TO US IS THAT

03:19:34.162 --> 03:19:36.764
WELL YOU KNOW ALL OF YOU IT DDS.

03:19:36.831 --> 03:19:39.067
AND I KEEP SAYING YOU GUYS ARE

03:19:39.133 --> 03:19:41.736
DDS AND IT'S HELPING UNDERSTAND

03:19:41.803 --> 03:19:43.404
THAT WE ARE ARE REALLY A TEAM

03:19:43.471 --> 03:19:44.872
AND WORKING TOGETHER.

03:19:44.939 --> 03:19:46.774
AND SO WORKING THROUGH THE

03:19:46.841 --> 03:19:48.042
CULTURE AND MAKING SURE THAT

03:19:48.109 --> 03:19:49.644
FOLKS ARE WORKING TOGETHER HAS

03:19:49.711 --> 03:19:51.379
REALLY BEEN KIND OF THE THE

03:19:51.446 --> 03:19:53.247
MISSION THAT I'VE WORKED ON OVER

03:19:53.314 --> 03:19:54.782
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

03:19:54.849 --> 03:19:56.617
AND MAKING SURE THAT CROSS WALK

03:19:56.684 --> 03:19:58.853
IS HAPPENING SO AN EFFORT THAT

03:19:58.920 --> 03:20:00.188
THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING THAT IS

03:20:00.254 --> 03:20:01.556
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

03:20:01.622 --> 03:20:02.490
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:20:02.557 --> 03:20:04.559
WE DON'T HAVE A SIDE ROAD SYSTEM.

03:20:04.625 --> 03:20:06.094
THAT THEY'RE NOT TALKING THAT

03:20:06.160 --> 03:20:07.895
THERE'S COLLABORATIVE WAYS TO BE

03:20:07.962 --> 03:20:09.330
ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

03:20:09.397 --> 03:20:10.631
GOING TO BE THAT DIALOGUE.

03:20:10.698 --> 03:20:12.066
THAT AS WERE HAVING THE REGIONAL

03:20:12.133 --> 03:20:13.468
CENTER STAFF THIS IS VERY TRUE

03:20:13.534 --> 03:20:14.168
ALSO WITH OUR SOUTHERN

03:20:14.235 --> 03:20:16.170
CALIFORNIA OFFICE WE NEED TO

03:20:16.237 --> 03:20:18.072
MAKE SURE THAT WERE VERY GOOD.

03:20:18.139 --> 03:20:18.506
AND PROVIDING THOSE

03:20:18.573 --> 03:20:20.241
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE HAVING

03:20:20.308 --> 03:20:21.909
THE COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSIONS WE

03:20:21.976 --> 03:20:23.478
ARE GOING TO ALSO BE DOING SOME

03:20:23.544 --> 03:20:25.613
TECHNOLOGY AS FAR AS MAKING SURE

03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:27.048
WE HAVE THE VIDEO CONFERENCING.

03:20:27.115 --> 03:20:28.750
GRANTED THAT'S JUST ONE PIECE

03:20:28.816 --> 03:20:31.018
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE SCHEDULE OF

03:20:31.085 --> 03:20:32.487
MEETINGS AND MAKING SURE THAT

03:20:32.553 --> 03:20:33.421
WE'RE HAVING THE COLLABORATIVE

03:20:33.488 --> 03:20:34.489
DISCUSSIONS OF SHARING

03:20:34.555 --> 03:20:36.190
INFORMATION. ONE OF THE THINGS

03:20:36.257 --> 03:20:39.360
WE ARE DOING IS TAKING A LOOK AT

03:20:39.427 --> 03:20:40.328
BRINGING TOGETHER THE

03:20:40.395 --> 03:20:41.028
INFORMATION THIS IS WHERE

03:20:41.095 --> 03:20:43.131
RESEARCH WILL BE ABLE TO HELP US.

03:20:43.197 --> 03:20:44.332
IS SAYING FOR EVERY REGIONAL

03:20:44.399 --> 03:20:46.033
CENTER WHAT IS THE INFORMATION

03:20:46.100 --> 03:20:47.902
THAT INFORMS US ABOUT WHAT IS

03:20:47.969 --> 03:20:49.904
OCCURRING WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

03:20:49.971 --> 03:20:51.706
TO DO THAT ALSO WITHIN OUR STATE

03:20:51.773 --> 03:20:53.908
OPERATED SERVICES SO WE WE HAVE

03:20:53.975 --> 03:20:55.843
VERY MUCH THOUGHT ABOUT -- WHAT

03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:57.178
ARE THE WAYS THAT WE'RE NOT

03:20:57.245 --> 03:20:58.980
GOING TO BE -- PUTTING UP

03:20:59.046 --> 03:21:00.348
SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE A

03:21:00.415 --> 03:21:03.518
BARRIER TO DOING WHAT WE WANT TO

03:21:03.584 --> 03:21:05.787
ACCOMPLISH.

03:21:05.853 --> 03:21:07.622
OKAY -- ALL RIGHT WELL THE

03:21:07.688 --> 03:21:09.957
APPRECIATE THAT -- AND I THINK

03:21:10.024 --> 03:21:12.493
YOU KNOW IT -- WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:21:12.560 --> 03:21:15.863
SEE A I THINK THE THE INCREASE

03:21:15.930 --> 03:21:17.365
STAFF FOR MORE OVERSIGHT I THINK

03:21:17.432 --> 03:21:19.033
ACTUALLY AND AND TRYING TO GET

03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:20.468
MORE CONSISTENCY I KNOW THE MAN

03:21:20.535 --> 03:21:21.769
REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE ON

03:21:21.836 --> 03:21:25.573
EXCELLENT JOB AND AND AND NAY OF

03:21:25.640 --> 03:21:26.574
HAVE VERY INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS

03:21:26.641 --> 03:21:27.542
WE'LL SEE HOW WE DISSEMINATE

03:21:27.608 --> 03:21:28.042
THAT.

03:21:28.109 --> 03:21:29.177
HOW CAN THE STATE PLAY A GREATER

03:21:29.243 --> 03:21:33.214
ROLE -- AND ALSO -- WORK MORE

03:21:33.281 --> 03:21:34.515
CLOSELY WITH THE REGIONAL

03:21:34.582 --> 03:21:35.583
CENTERS I KNOW DEVELOP THE

03:21:35.650 --> 03:21:36.951
SURGEON CLOSING DOWN YOU STILL

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:37.752
WILL HAVE A UNIT -- REPORTER

TEN YEARS.

03:51:06.953 --> 03:51:07.687
HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION

03:51:07.753 --> 03:51:09.388
AND I'M ALSO THE FATHER OF A

03:51:09.455 --> 03:51:10.489
TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD WHO.

IS GETTING READY TOLEAVE THE

03:51:11.624 --> 03:51:13.025
SYSTEM IN JUNE THAT THE SCHOOL

SYSTEM THAT IS AND GO INTO THE

03:51:15.494 --> 03:51:16.929
ADULT SYSTEM HERE SO I HAVE A

03:51:16.996 --> 03:51:19.365
LOT OF RELATIVE EXPERIENCES --

03:51:19.432 --> 03:51:20.466
RELATED TO THIS.

03:51:20.533 --> 03:51:21.467
CENTER GROWS PROPOSAL

03:51:21.534 --> 03:51:25.504
SPECIFICALLY -- CALLED -- FOR

03:51:25.571 --> 03:51:26.939
SORT OF AN APPLICATION OF WHAT

03:51:27.006 --> 03:51:28.307
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

03:51:28.374 --> 03:51:29.609
PUT OUT IN THEIR STUDY WHERE

03:51:29.675 --> 03:51:31.611
THEY WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT THE

03:51:31.677 --> 03:51:33.145
AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT MIGHT BE

03:51:33.212 --> 03:51:34.347
DERIVED.

03:51:34.413 --> 03:51:36.249
WHEN THE -- DEVELOPMENTAL

03:51:36.315 --> 03:51:37.550
CENTERS ARE CLOSED.

03:51:37.617 --> 03:51:39.485
AND THE LA IS REPORT BASICALLY

03:51:39.552 --> 03:51:41.020
CAME OUT AND SAID THERE WAS

03:51:41.087 --> 03:51:42.288
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MILLION

03:51:42.355 --> 03:51:43.089
DOLLARS.

03:51:43.155 --> 03:51:44.390
THAT WOULD BE SAVED TO THE STATE

03:51:44.457 --> 03:51:45.925
ANNUALLY BY THE CLOSURE THE

03:51:45.992 --> 03:51:47.126
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS.

03:51:47.193 --> 03:51:48.894
I THINK CENTER GROWS POSITION ON

03:51:48.961 --> 03:51:51.063
THAT IS -- IN LIGHT OF ALL OF

03:51:51.130 --> 03:51:52.898
THE RATE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN THE

03:51:52.965 --> 03:51:55.067
STATE BE ISSUES THAT YOU TALKED

03:51:55.134 --> 03:51:56.502
ABOUT EARLIER SUCH AS THEY HAVE

03:51:56.569 --> 03:51:58.070
TO A BILLING THE HOLIDAY

03:51:58.137 --> 03:51:59.338
SCHEDULE SOCIAL WRECK CAMPS.

03:51:59.405 --> 03:52:00.640
WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD

03:52:00.706 --> 03:52:02.008
CAPTURE SOME OF THE SAVINGS AND

03:52:02.074 --> 03:52:03.909
MOVE IT OVER. TO THESE COMMUNITY

03:52:03.976 --> 03:52:06.612
PROGRAMS TO BOLSTER THEPROGRAMS.

03:52:06.679 --> 03:52:08.981
I THINK FURTHER -- CENTER GROVE

03:52:09.048 --> 03:52:11.284
IN HER CAUCUS HAS DEVELOPED A

03:52:11.350 --> 03:52:12.785
LETTER THAT I THINK YOU'VE SEEN.

03:52:12.852 --> 03:52:14.186
THAT PARALLELS THE LETTER THE

03:52:14.253 --> 03:52:16.222
YOU'VE ALSO PROBABLY RECEIVE

03:52:16.289 --> 03:52:17.590
FROM SENATOR STERN -- THERE ARE

03:52:17.657 --> 03:52:19.125
NOW SEVENTEEN MEMBERS OF THE

03:52:19.191 --> 03:52:20.593
SENATE THERE SUPPORTING THE

03:52:20.660 --> 03:52:22.728
PROPOSAL FOR AN 80% ACROSS THE

03:52:22.795 --> 03:52:24.430
BOARD RATE INCREASE FOR

03:52:24.497 --> 03:52:25.865
COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AND

03:52:25.931 --> 03:52:27.099
THAT WAS PART OF CENTER GROCER

03:52:27.166 --> 03:52:28.367
QUESTIONS WELL.

03:52:28.434 --> 03:52:31.871
AND THEN -- THE LAST THING WAS --

03:52:31.937 --> 03:52:33.539
OF COURSE RELATED TO THE THE

03:52:33.606 --> 03:52:34.940
VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT WE

03:52:35.007 --> 03:52:35.541
DISCUSSED EARLIER MOVING THAT

03:52:35.608 --> 03:52:36.909
SAVINGS.

03:52:36.976 --> 03:52:39.078
I THINK -- ONE OF THE CONCERNS

03:52:39.145 --> 03:52:40.279
THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS AROUND

03:52:40.346 --> 03:52:40.980
THE US AND I THINK THIS IS

03:52:41.047 --> 03:52:42.548
SHARED BY SENATOR GROVE IS THE

03:52:42.615 --> 03:52:43.883
WE HAVE A LENGTHY HISTORY IN

03:52:43.949 --> 03:52:44.884
CALIFORNIA.

03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:46.152
OF SHUTTING DOWN THESE

03:52:46.218 --> 03:52:48.454
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WHICH WERE

03:52:48.521 --> 03:52:50.189
LONG TIME NOW SAYS USED TO SERVE

03:52:50.256 --> 03:52:52.024
CALIFORNIANS WITHINTELLECTUAL

03:52:52.091 --> 03:52:53.592
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

03:52:53.659 --> 03:52:54.760
AND WHEN THEY'RE CLOSE THE

03:52:54.827 --> 03:52:56.295
LARGELY GO AWAY AND SO TO THE

03:52:56.362 --> 03:52:59.665
ASSETS AND THE OPERATING DOLLARS.

03:52:59.732 --> 03:53:01.534
JUST LOOKING BACKWARDS I'VE

03:53:01.600 --> 03:53:02.668
PULLED SOME FIGURES ON THIS.

03:53:02.735 --> 03:53:05.838
YOU KNOW DATING BACK.

03:53:05.905 --> 03:53:06.472
TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT THE

03:53:06.539 --> 03:53:07.340
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS BUDGET IN

03:53:07.406 --> 03:53:09.975
CALIFORNIA SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY

03:53:10.042 --> 03:53:10.776
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE

03:53:10.843 --> 03:53:13.746
SERVING -- JUST UNDER THREE

03:53:13.813 --> 03:53:15.247
THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT AS A BED PER

03:53:15.314 --> 03:53:17.383
BED COST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

03:53:17.450 --> 03:53:18.551
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON.

03:53:18.617 --> 03:53:19.885
AND NOW WE'RE DOWN TO WHAT WE'RE

03:53:19.952 --> 03:53:21.320
TALKING ABOUT TODAY WITH A VERY

03:53:21.387 --> 03:53:22.722
LOW OPERATING BUDGET.

03:53:22.788 --> 03:53:24.523
AND ASSETS THAT ARE JUST

03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:25.157
DISAPPEARING WRITER FROM UNDER

03:53:25.224 --> 03:53:25.991
US.

03:53:26.058 --> 03:53:27.460
I THINK THE COMMUNITY MANY OF US

03:53:27.526 --> 03:53:29.228
IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND I THINK

03:53:29.295 --> 03:53:30.429
THIS IS SURE BY SENATOR BREAUX

03:53:30.496 --> 03:53:31.297
AND OTHERS.

03:53:31.364 --> 03:53:33.032
WOULD TAKE THE VIEW THAT WE HAVE

03:53:33.099 --> 03:53:35.568
ONE LAST TIME. TO DO SOMETHING

03:53:35.634 --> 03:53:36.936
DIFFERENT IN THE SYSTEM.

03:53:37.002 --> 03:53:38.504
WHILE WE ALL COMPLAIN ABOUT THE

03:53:38.571 --> 03:53:39.839
AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR

03:53:39.905 --> 03:53:42.007
COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS IS NOT

03:53:42.074 --> 03:53:43.042
LOST ON A LOT OF US.

03:53:43.109 --> 03:53:45.144
WHO WE ARE AGAIN -- GOING TO A

03:53:45.211 --> 03:53:45.745
POSITION WHERE WE'RE GOING TO

03:53:45.811 --> 03:53:48.214
CLOSE. TO TREMENDOUS ASSETS IN

03:53:48.280 --> 03:53:50.483
THIS COMMUNITY ONE IN CINEMA.

03:53:50.549 --> 03:53:51.684
THAT'S BEEN IN THIS COMMUNITY

03:53:51.751 --> 03:53:55.354
SINCE THE EIGHTEEN NINETIES

03:53:55.421 --> 03:53:56.188
SERVING THIS POPULATION.

03:53:56.255 --> 03:53:57.223
AND THERE'S REALLY NOTHING.

03:53:57.289 --> 03:53:58.758
IN ANY OF THIS CLOSURE THAT

03:53:58.824 --> 03:54:00.226
BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY INSTEAD

03:54:00.292 --> 03:54:01.761

03:54:01.827 --> 03:54:04.063
ISSUES HERE EARLIER -- FIGHTING

03:54:04.130 --> 03:54:05.598
FOR RATE INCREASES AND HOPEFULLY

03:54:05.664 --> 03:54:07.099
GETTING SOME ASPECTS OF THE RATE

03:54:07.166 --> 03:54:10.236
STUDY -- IMPLEMENTED SO WHAT I'D

03:54:10.302 --> 03:54:11.070
LIKE TO DO IS AT LEAST OF

03:54:11.137 --> 03:54:13.773
NOTHING ELSE PUT IN A MARKER --

03:54:13.839 --> 03:54:15.107
FOR THIS LEGISLATURE IN YOU TO

03:54:15.174 --> 03:54:17.143

03:54:17.209 --> 03:54:18.411
ON THIS.

03:54:18.477 --> 03:54:20.212
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS

03:54:20.279 --> 03:54:21.547

COUNTY AND THE LOCALS.

03:54:32.525 --> 03:54:35.027
THERE'S NO INTEREST FOR THIRTY

03:54:35.094 --> 03:54:36.462
SIX OTHER LEGISLATORS IN YOUR

03:54:36.529 --> 03:54:37.329

03:54:50.409 --> 03:54:52.111
RED DESIRE FROM PRE SHEET THAT

03:54:52.178 --> 03:54:54.280
PERSPECTIVE WE'VE HEARD THAT

03:54:54.346 --> 03:54:56.582
HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE -- WAY

03:54:56.649 --> 03:54:58.984
BEFORE WELL -- OVER CERTAINLY

FOR EVEN LONGER.

03:55:07.860 --> 03:55:10.463
THAN THAT -- AND CERTAINLY I

03:55:10.529 --> 03:55:12.731
THINK ILL WITH THAT'S THAT'S WHY

03:55:12.798 --> 03:55:14.233

THAT'S IN FACT I WOULD BE NOTE

03:55:19.905 --> 03:55:21.640
THAT THE COST OF KEEPING THIS IN

03:55:21.707 --> 03:55:25.144
THE SERVICE WARM SHUT DOWN IS

03:55:25.211 --> 03:55:26.045
ABOUT.

03:55:26.111 --> 03:55:27.112
ROUGHLY THE IT'S FOR FORTY SOME

03:55:27.179 --> 03:55:28.647
BILLION.

03:55:28.714 --> 03:55:29.715
DOLLARS RIGHT.

OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD SO AND

03:55:33.219 --> 03:55:35.754
THAT THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF

03:55:35.821 --> 03:55:37.556
OUR CAMP PROPOSAL WE THINK.

03:55:37.623 --> 03:55:38.624
AS WELL SO I MEAN THAT'S WHAT

03:55:38.691 --> 03:55:40.259
WAS THAT FOR SOME OF THAT MONEY

03:55:40.326 --> 03:55:43.562
IS GOING -- ALSO I JUST MAKE

03:55:43.629 --> 03:55:45.898
NOTE THAT IN THE OVERVIEW -- SO

03:55:45.965 --> 03:55:47.967
WOULD YES WE HAVE REDUCTION IN

03:55:48.033 --> 03:55:49.702
STATE OPERATED RESIDENTIAL

03:55:49.768 --> 03:55:51.403
COMMITTEE FACILITIES.

03:55:51.470 --> 03:55:52.938
THE SO THERE'S A REDUCTION --

03:55:53.005 --> 03:55:56.642
HERE OF EIGHTY FOUR WELL. EIGHTY

03:55:56.709 --> 03:55:58.477
FOUR MILLION -- HERE BUT I ALSO

03:55:58.544 --> 03:56:00.579
MAKE NOTE THAT THE INCREASE AND

03:56:00.646 --> 03:56:01.847
WHAT'S BUDGET FOR COMMITTEE

03:56:01.914 --> 03:56:04.683
SERVICES UP FIVE FIVE HUNDRED

03:56:04.750 --> 03:56:06.886
SIX MILLION SO MANY FOLD.

03:56:06.952 --> 03:56:09.455
LARGER THAN THE REDUCTION SO WE

03:56:09.522 --> 03:56:12.124
ARE PUTTING MORE MONEY IN -- IT

03:56:12.191 --> 03:56:13.392
SO EVEN THOUGH THE SO THERE'S A

03:56:13.459 --> 03:56:15.394
DROP THAT THE DROP IS A FRACTION

03:56:15.461 --> 03:56:16.562
OF THE INCREASE.

03:56:16.629 --> 03:56:17.463
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD

03:56:17.530 --> 03:56:18.998

LEGISLATORS IN PROPOSING PUTTING --

03:56:35.481 --> 03:56:36.949
NOT JUST THE SAME BUT EVEN MORE

03:56:37.016 --> 03:56:39.718
MONEY AND THEN WERE REDUCING --

03:56:39.785 --> 03:56:41.020
WITH THE WITH SOME OF THE

03:56:41.086 --> 03:56:42.922
SHUTDOWN BUT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

03:56:42.988 --> 03:56:44.590
SAYING I WILL CERTAINLY WE WANT.

03:56:44.657 --> 03:56:45.958
TO KEEP IN MIND THOSE ASSETS AYE

03:56:46.025 --> 03:56:47.493
AYE I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO TRY

03:56:47.560 --> 03:56:48.193
TO DO.

03:56:48.260 --> 03:56:51.730
IS -- AND AND I AGREE WE PRIDE

03:56:51.797 --> 03:56:53.265
HAVE NOT DONE AS GOOD A JOB IN

03:56:53.332 --> 03:56:54.733
DOING THIS IS FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

03:56:54.800 --> 03:56:56.101
THE RIGHT AMOUNT RIGHT I MEAN

03:56:56.168 --> 03:56:57.469
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

03:56:57.536 --> 03:56:58.737
WHAT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT WHAT'S

03:56:58.804 --> 03:57:01.006
YOU KNOW AND WERE BEHIND ON THAT.

03:57:01.073 --> 03:57:02.641
AND THAT'S WHY WE FOR THOSE

03:57:02.708 --> 03:57:03.742
PROPOSALS.

03:57:03.809 --> 03:57:05.010
AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THEM

03:57:05.077 --> 03:57:07.346
THE MORE POURTANT THING THAT I

03:57:07.413 --> 03:57:08.447
THINK WE WANT TO TRY.

03:57:08.514 --> 03:57:10.583
TO ACHIEVE -- AND CERTAINLY SOME

03:57:10.649 --> 03:57:12.151
ONE WAY TO TRY TO GET THERE IS

03:57:12.217 --> 03:57:13.218
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE

03:57:13.285 --> 03:57:14.820
ASSETS THAT WE ALL HAVE AN THAT

03:57:14.887 --> 03:57:16.555
WE'RE TRANSITIONING BECAUSE OF A

03:57:16.622 --> 03:57:17.856
DIFFERENT DIRECTION WE'RE GOING.

03:57:17.923 --> 03:57:19.358
SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE

03:57:19.425 --> 03:57:20.292
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT BUT

03:57:20.359 --> 03:57:23.896
CERTAIN I HOPE WE'RE NOT TALKING

03:57:23.963 --> 03:57:25.431
ABOUT LIMITING.

03:57:25.497 --> 03:57:26.298
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SIMPLY BEING

03:57:26.365 --> 03:57:27.199
WHILE WE SHUT DOWN THIS AND

03:57:27.266 --> 03:57:27.833
THAT'S THE ONLY AMOUNT OF MONEY

03:57:27.900 --> 03:57:29.101
WE SHIFT OVER AND DAY APPRECIATE

03:57:29.168 --> 03:57:29.668
THAT AND THIS AT LEAST THIS

03:57:29.735 --> 03:57:30.803
BUDGET PROPOSAL?

03:57:30.869 --> 03:57:31.870
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT FORWARD

03:57:31.937 --> 03:57:33.238
THAT IS ACTUALLY A LOT MORE

03:57:33.305 --> 03:57:35.941
MONEY GOING IN THE AND IS THEN

03:57:36.008 --> 03:57:37.977
JUST THE MONEY THAT WE'RE SAVING --

03:57:38.043 --> 03:57:41.113
AND AND AND BASICALLY AS WERE

03:57:41.180 --> 03:57:42.581
SHUTTING DOWN WHAT WE MOVED

03:57:42.648 --> 03:57:44.984
EVERYONE OUT OF CINEMA AND ALSO

03:57:45.050 --> 03:57:47.219

WE THINK THIS SHOULD BE PART OF

03:58:03.569 --> 03:58:04.536
THE SOLUTION.

03:58:04.603 --> 03:58:05.804
AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT A LOT

03:58:05.871 --> 03:58:07.139
OF THE MONEY THAT -- YOU'RE%

03:58:07.206 --> 03:58:11.343
TALKING ABOUT THAT IMPROVES THE

03:58:11.410 --> 03:58:11.877
FIGURE FOR COMMUNITY BASED

03:58:11.944 --> 03:58:13.112

GROWTH BUT THE RATES HAVEN'T

03:58:15.447 --> 03:58:16.649
RISEN SO THAT MEANS THE QUALITY

03:58:16.715 --> 03:58:18.384
LEVEL SERVICES AVAILABILITY

03:58:18.450 --> 03:58:20.319
STILL REMAINS WHERE IT IS.

04:09:16.941 --> 04:09:18.043
VALLEY THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

04:09:18.109 --> 04:09:19.477
WE'VE HEARD THOSE STATISTICS AND

04:09:19.544 --> 04:09:21.313
THAT FOR ME OUR MAIN POINT IS

04:09:21.379 --> 04:09:22.414
THAT THERE'S SORT OF A LACK OF

04:09:22.480 --> 04:09:24.149
COMPREHENSIVE DATA TO UNDERSTAND

04:09:24.215 --> 04:09:26.451
THE DEMAND FOR CRISIS SERVICES

04:09:26.518 --> 04:09:26.785
IN THE STATE.

04:09:26.851 --> 04:09:28.586
GENERALLY.

04:09:28.653 --> 04:09:30.655
WE DON'T OUR OFFICE DOES NOT --

04:09:30.722 --> 04:09:32.157
DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THAT

04:09:32.223 --> 04:09:32.924
THERE IS.

04:09:32.991 --> 04:09:34.626
A LIKELY A NEED IN THE CENTRAL

04:09:34.693 --> 04:09:36.461
VALLEY THAT'S THE YOU KNOW WHEN

04:09:36.528 --> 04:09:38.363
THE ORIGINAL AND SAFETY NET PLAN

04:09:38.430 --> 04:09:39.898
CAME OUT THAT SEEM TO BE THE

04:09:39.964 --> 04:09:41.366
AREA THAT WAS.

04:09:41.433 --> 04:09:43.068
MISSING - SOME STATE OR IN

04:09:43.134 --> 04:09:46.171
SERVICES -- HOWEVER ARE OUR

04:09:46.237 --> 04:09:49.374
ULTIMATE RECOMMENDATION IS -- TO

04:09:49.441 --> 04:09:50.642
WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE

04:09:50.709 --> 04:09:52.377
TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOP --

04:09:52.444 --> 04:09:53.912
AN UPDATE TO THEIR OVERALL

04:09:53.978 --> 04:09:56.815
SAFETY NET PLAN -- PERHAPS

04:09:56.881 --> 04:09:58.483
SUBMITTED WITH THEIR BUDGET --

04:09:58.550 --> 04:10:00.752
NEXT YEAR AND THE PURPOSE OF

04:10:00.819 --> 04:10:02.620
THIS WOULD TO BE TO GET A BETTER

04:10:02.687 --> 04:10:04.823
SENSE OF OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT

04:10:04.889 --> 04:10:07.192
IS LOOKING AT THE DEMAND FOR

04:10:07.258 --> 04:10:09.694
SERVICES -- WHAT SERVICES DO

04:10:09.761 --> 04:10:11.730
REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE AID AND

04:10:11.796 --> 04:10:12.731
HOW CAN THOSE SERVICES BE

04:10:12.797 --> 04:10:15.266
UTILIZED TO PREVENT CRISES FROM

04:10:15.333 --> 04:10:18.703
EVEN ARISING -- AND THEN -- THE

04:10:18.770 --> 04:10:20.672
OBVIOUSLY THE THE STATE HAS

04:10:20.739 --> 04:10:22.907
INVESTED A LOT OF DOLLARS INTO

04:10:22.974 --> 04:10:24.209
DEVELOPING THESE NEW.

04:10:24.275 --> 04:10:25.977
MODELS OF HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY

04:10:26.044 --> 04:10:27.345
AND IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO

04:10:27.412 --> 04:10:28.913
HAVE A SENSE OF HOW ARE THEY

04:10:28.980 --> 04:10:30.782
WORKING WATER -- THE LESSONS

04:10:30.849 --> 04:10:32.183
LEARNED HOW DO WE PLAN TO

04:10:32.250 --> 04:10:34.986
EVALUATE -- THOSE SERVICES ON AN

04:10:35.053 --> 04:10:37.155
ONGOING BASIS AND THEN JUST A

04:10:37.222 --> 04:10:39.457
FINAL COMMENT -- WE DID HAVE

04:10:39.524 --> 04:10:40.792
RAISED SOME QUESTIONS IN OUR

04:10:40.859 --> 04:10:42.827
BUDGET ANALYSIS ABOUT PLACING

04:10:42.894 --> 04:10:44.763
THE CENTRAL VALLEY HOMES IN NEAR

04:10:44.829 --> 04:10:46.064
THE PART OF BILL DEVELOPMENTAL

04:10:46.131 --> 04:10:46.664
CENTER.

04:10:46.731 --> 04:10:49.067
THAT MIGHT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE

04:10:49.134 --> 04:10:50.869
IN THE VERY NEAR TERM BECAUSE

04:10:50.935 --> 04:10:54.906
THERE ARE SOME STAFF FROM THE

04:10:54.973 --> 04:10:55.507
PORTABLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER

04:10:55.573 --> 04:10:55.707
THAT.

04:10:55.774 --> 04:10:56.341

04:10:56.408 --> 04:10:58.076
THESE HOMES BUT WE DO.

04:10:58.143 --> 04:10:59.677
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

04:10:59.744 --> 04:11:01.112

OF THIS MAGNITUDE IN THREE

04:11:52.263 --> 04:11:53.898
MINUTES -- BUT LET ME PAINT A

04:11:53.965 --> 04:11:55.800
PICTURE FOR YOU AS CENTRAL

TWENTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS

04:11:58.403 --> 04:11:59.504
AND FAMILIES WITH A CURRENT

04:11:59.571 --> 04:12:00.972
GROWTH RATE OF 7%.

04:12:01.039 --> 04:12:04.142
WE REPRESENT ABOUT 6% OF THE

04:12:04.209 --> 04:12:04.742
INDIVIDUAL SERVICE THROUGHOUT

04:12:04.809 --> 04:12:05.643
THE STATE.

04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:07.011
WE HISTORICALLY RECEIVE AN

04:12:07.078 --> 04:12:08.680
AVERAGE OF THREE CRISIS CALLS

04:12:08.746 --> 04:12:10.782
PER NIGHT -- LAST NIGHT WE

04:12:10.849 --> 04:12:13.051
RECEIVED THREE CRISIS CALLS IN

04:12:13.117 --> 04:12:14.919
ONE NIGHT I'M SO WE'RE STARTING

04:12:14.986 --> 04:12:15.787
TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THESE

04:12:15.854 --> 04:12:18.223
CRISIS CALLS AT NIGHT TIME --

04:12:18.289 --> 04:12:19.991
WHICH GIVES US ON AVERAGE RIGHT

04:12:20.058 --> 04:12:21.793
NOW ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

04:12:21.860 --> 04:12:24.496
SIX CRISIS CALLS -- PER YEAR --

04:12:24.562 --> 04:12:26.498
BUT INCREASING OVER TIME WE ALSO

04:12:26.564 --> 04:12:28.566
HAVE A LIST OF INDIVIDUALS WERE

04:12:28.633 --> 04:12:31.769
CHALLENGING TO SERVE -- WHO HAVE --

04:12:31.836 --> 04:12:33.571
HISTORICAL ISSUES WITH HIGH

04:12:33.638 --> 04:12:35.940
ACUITY BEHAVIORS ARE CHALLENGES

04:12:36.007 --> 04:12:37.275
ARE MEDICAL NEEDS -- AND THEN

04:12:37.342 --> 04:12:38.776
PERIODS WHERE THEY'RE DOING OKAY

04:12:38.843 --> 04:12:40.578
AND WE CAN ENGAGE IN SPECIALIZED

04:12:40.645 --> 04:12:42.680
THERAPEUTIC RESOURCES -- SO IF

04:12:42.747 --> 04:12:47.852
YOU EXTRAPOLATE THOSE NUMBERS

04:12:47.919 --> 04:12:48.887
OUT TO THE STATE WIDE.

04:12:48.953 --> 04:12:50.555
IS OUT TO ABOUT THIRTY NINE

04:12:50.622 --> 04:12:51.356
HUNDRED PEOPLE -- STATEWIDE --

04:12:51.422 --> 04:12:52.657
THAT THAT ARE PROBABLY IN CRISIS

04:12:52.724 --> 04:12:53.491
OVER TIME YOU KNOW SOME WITH

04:12:53.558 --> 04:12:55.527
HIGH ACUITY AND SOME JUST WITH

04:12:55.593 --> 04:12:56.694
MORE CHRONIC SITUATIONS.

04:12:56.761 --> 04:12:57.962
SO OUR RECOMMENDATION AT THIS

04:12:58.029 --> 04:12:59.497
TIME AS A REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM

04:12:59.564 --> 04:13:00.832
IS AS SIGNIFICANT START UP

04:13:00.899 --> 04:13:02.166
FUNDING FROM THE COMMUNITY

04:13:02.233 --> 04:13:03.701
RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

04:13:03.768 --> 04:13:05.169
IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO CREATE

04:13:05.236 --> 04:13:07.672
CRISIS AND LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL

04:13:07.739 --> 04:13:09.140
OPTIONS WITH APPROPRIATE CARE

04:13:09.207 --> 04:13:11.075
AND TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS

04:13:11.142 --> 04:13:12.577
WITH THE MOST CHALLENGING NEEDS.

04:13:12.644 --> 04:13:14.145
WE KNOW THAT THE HOUSING MODELS

04:13:14.212 --> 04:13:14.979
OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER

04:13:15.046 --> 04:13:16.814
CLOSURE HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE SUCH

04:13:16.881 --> 04:13:17.949
AS THE ENHANCE BEHAVIORAL

04:13:18.016 --> 04:13:19.050
SUPPORT HOMES AND THE OUR

04:13:19.117 --> 04:13:20.151
FISSIONS THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL

04:13:20.218 --> 04:13:22.086
FACILITIES FOR PERSONS WITH

04:13:22.153 --> 04:13:23.288
SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS --

04:13:23.354 --> 04:13:24.389
HOWEVER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR

04:13:24.455 --> 04:13:25.523
NEED INCREASES ARE WORRIED

04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:27.225
RESOURCES ARE NOT CURRENTLY

04:13:27.292 --> 04:13:28.993
KEEPING UP -- WE WOULDN'T

04:13:29.060 --> 04:13:31.529
RECOMMEND FRONT LOADING CAPACITY

04:13:31.596 --> 04:13:33.131
NOW OUT OF THE C. R. D. US --

04:13:33.197 --> 04:13:34.632
AND THEN RELEASING THAT DOWN THE

04:13:34.699 --> 04:13:36.234
ROAD ONCE WE HAVE ACHIEVED

04:13:36.301 --> 04:13:38.236
CAPACITY FOR THESE HIGH ACUITY

04:13:38.303 --> 04:13:40.805
SITUATIONS -- THIS ALSO

04:13:40.872 --> 04:13:43.474
INCREASES THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS --

04:13:43.541 --> 04:13:45.276
FOR INDIVIDUALS SERVED AND

04:13:45.343 --> 04:13:48.146
FAMILIES -- AS WELL I'M A BETTER

04:13:48.212 --> 04:13:52.450
SUPPORT FOR THEM AND INDIVIDUAL

04:13:52.517 --> 04:13:54.719
CHOICE.

04:13:54.786 --> 04:13:55.320
BUILDING A BETTER OUTCOMES FOR

04:13:55.386 --> 04:13:55.553
FOLKS.

04:13:55.620 --> 04:13:56.354
SO I JUST WANNA SURE AT LEAST

04:13:56.421 --> 04:13:58.323
ONE POSITIVE STORY WITH YOU

04:13:58.389 --> 04:13:59.424
BECAUSE IT ON THE T. MARK.

04:13:59.490 --> 04:14:00.124
WE HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL SO IN THE

04:14:00.191 --> 04:14:02.193
CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE TWO OF

04:14:02.260 --> 04:14:05.463
THE SPECIALIZED HOMES WERE THE

04:14:05.530 --> 04:14:06.898
FIRST IN THE STATE WE WERE THE

04:14:06.965 --> 04:14:07.765
FIRST IN THE STATE TO DEVELOP

04:14:07.832 --> 04:14:09.434
THEM SOMEONE WAS THAT A LADY

04:14:09.500 --> 04:14:11.102
CROSS SECURE PERIMETER HOME.

04:14:11.169 --> 04:14:11.903
WE HAVE A FELLOW IN THERE WITH

04:14:11.970 --> 04:14:13.705
DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY WHICH WE

04:14:13.771 --> 04:14:15.306
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY.

04:14:15.373 --> 04:14:17.742
AND HE SUICIDAL IDEATION

04:14:17.809 --> 04:14:18.810
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE TIME OF

04:14:18.876 --> 04:14:20.612
HIS CAR ACCIDENT ALL THESE SORTS

04:14:20.678 --> 04:14:22.447
OF THINGS -- YOU KNOW AND ALL

04:14:22.513 --> 04:14:23.414
THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE

04:14:23.481 --> 04:14:24.649
STORIES LIKE THIS.

04:14:24.716 --> 04:14:26.484
BUT THIS YOUNG MAN IS NOW

04:14:26.551 --> 04:14:29.287
MENTORING HIS PEERS -- USING HIS

04:14:29.354 --> 04:14:31.122
COPING SKILLS TO TEACH OTHERS

04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:33.024
COPING SKILLS AROUND HIS

04:14:33.091 --> 04:14:35.426
SITUATION AND ACTUALLY HAVE AN

04:14:35.493 --> 04:14:37.128
IMPACT ON OTHER PEOPLE AND THIS

04:14:37.195 --> 04:14:38.429
IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T KNOW

04:14:38.496 --> 04:14:39.097
THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE

04:14:39.163 --> 04:14:42.467
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE BEFORE SO IT

04:14:42.533 --> 04:14:44.936
REALLY WONDERFUL OUTCOMES -- WE

04:14:45.003 --> 04:14:46.638
DO AS REGIONAL CENTERS IN A

04:14:46.704 --> 04:14:47.372
SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET A LITTLE

04:14:47.438 --> 04:14:48.873
CONFUSING THEY THINK I CAN'T I

04:14:48.940 --> 04:14:50.074
JUST AS A FAMILY MEMBER CALL THE

04:14:50.141 --> 04:14:51.709
STATE DIRECTLY -- THE

04:14:51.776 --> 04:14:52.577
RELATIONSHIP IS WITH THE

04:14:52.644 --> 04:14:54.345
REGIONAL CENTER WE DO SERVE

04:14:54.412 --> 04:14:55.346
THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN AND

04:14:55.413 --> 04:14:57.148
THERE'S SOME CONFUSION SOMETIMES

04:14:57.215 --> 04:14:58.516
BUT THE IPPV.

04:14:58.583 --> 04:15:03.921
WHICH IS AN EVENT -- ANYWAY I'LL

04:15:03.988 --> 04:15:06.024
STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT PART.

04:15:06.090 --> 04:15:07.959
SO -- ANYWAY FAMILIES NEED A

04:15:08.026 --> 04:15:09.027
BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

04:15:09.093 --> 04:15:10.261
REGIONAL CENTERS CAN DO WHEN

04:15:10.328 --> 04:15:11.996
THEY'RE CRISIS AND THERE'S A

04:15:12.063 --> 04:15:14.932
MISPERCEPTION BUT STAFF ARE --

04:15:14.999 --> 04:15:16.901
ONLY SEE FAMILIES ANNUALLY --

04:15:16.968 --> 04:15:18.536
BUT WITH THIS ISSUE OF CAPACITY

04:15:18.603 --> 04:15:20.138
WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE C.

04:22:47.952 --> 04:22:52.356
OF CRISIS -- US SERVICE SYSTEM --

04:22:52.423 --> 04:22:53.724
SO THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY

04:22:53.791 --> 04:22:55.926
IS WE CURRENTLY HAVE STATE

04:22:55.993 --> 04:22:57.661
OPERATED CRISIS TEAMS WHICH ARE

04:22:57.728 --> 04:22:59.997
TERRIFIC WE NEED TO EXPAND THE

04:23:00.064 --> 04:23:02.166
CAPACITY OF THOSE CRISIS TEAMS

04:23:02.233 --> 04:23:03.667
TO SERVE PEOPLE STATEWIDE.

04:23:03.734 --> 04:23:05.636
IT SHOULDN'T FOR FOR PEOPLE THAT

04:23:05.703 --> 04:23:06.937
ARE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

04:23:07.004 --> 04:23:08.405
SECURITY IN CRISIS WE NEED TO

04:23:08.472 --> 04:23:10.608
HAVE THAT COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT

04:23:10.674 --> 04:23:12.076
FOR ALL OF THEM AND WE'RE NOT

04:23:12.143 --> 04:23:13.444
THERE YET.

04:23:13.511 --> 04:23:15.446
ON THE SECOND IS WE ARE

04:23:15.513 --> 04:23:17.882
PROPOSING CRISIS CAPACITY FOR

04:23:17.948 --> 04:23:19.250
CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS THAT WILL

04:23:19.316 --> 04:23:20.951
SERVE PRECISELY TWELVE

04:23:21.018 --> 04:23:23.854
INDIVIDUALS I THINK. THREE HOMES.

04:23:23.921 --> 04:23:27.625
IS IN SUFFICIENT WEEK.

04:23:27.691 --> 04:23:28.792
WE HAVE ONE IN THE FAR NORTH ONE

04:23:28.859 --> 04:23:30.027
IN THE CENTRAL WHICH I THINK IS

04:23:30.094 --> 04:23:31.662
GREAT AND ONE IN THE SOUTH BUT

04:23:31.729 --> 04:23:32.897
IT WILL MEAN.

04:23:32.963 --> 04:23:34.632
THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE IN CRISIS

04:23:34.698 --> 04:23:37.268
ARE MOVED LONG DISTANCES FROM

04:23:37.334 --> 04:23:39.003
THEIR FAMILIES TO RECEIVE THOSE

04:23:39.069 --> 04:23:40.738
SERVICES FOR UP TO EIGHTEEN

04:23:40.804 --> 04:23:42.940
MONTHS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

04:23:43.007 --> 04:23:44.475
EXPANDING THE MONEY AVAILABLE

04:23:44.542 --> 04:23:45.809
AND BUILDING THOSE OUT MORE

04:23:45.876 --> 04:23:46.944
QUICKLY.

04:23:47.011 --> 04:23:48.479
IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

04:23:48.546 --> 04:23:50.314
THINGS WE CAN DO TO AVOID THE

04:23:50.381 --> 04:23:54.451
KIND OF A SITUATION THAT AND HER

04:23:54.518 --> 04:23:55.953
FAMILY FOUND THEMSELVES IN -- WE

04:23:56.020 --> 04:23:57.721
ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE LIMIT

04:23:57.788 --> 04:23:58.856
ON THE USE OF SECLUSION

04:23:58.923 --> 04:24:01.592
RESTRAINT IN CHILDREN'S CRISIS

04:24:01.659 --> 04:24:03.527
HOMES AS A WAY OF NOT THERE ARE

04:24:03.594 --> 04:24:04.995
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THAT

04:24:05.062 --> 04:24:05.963
MAY NEED TO BE DONE BUT THERE

04:24:06.030 --> 04:24:07.631
ARE PROTOCOLS THAT THE

04:24:07.698 --> 04:24:08.566
DEPARTMENT HAS DEVELOPED FOR A

04:24:08.632 --> 04:24:09.700
TOLD HOMES THAT SHOULD BE

04:24:09.767 --> 04:24:11.602
REPLICATED -- IN THE CHILDREN'S

04:24:11.669 --> 04:24:14.638
CRISIS HOMES -- THE DEPARTMENT

04:24:14.705 --> 04:24:16.240
APPROPRIATELY HAS IDENTIFIED OF

04:24:16.307 --> 04:24:17.908
THE NEED FOR REDUCE CASELOADS WE

04:24:17.975 --> 04:24:19.677
SUPPORT THAT WE WILL NOTE THAT

04:24:19.743 --> 04:24:21.679
THERE IS A TIME LIMIT ABOUT HOW

04:24:21.745 --> 04:24:23.881
LONG THOSE CAN BE AVAILABLE.

04:24:23.948 --> 04:24:25.249
AND WE THINK THE STANDARD FOR

04:24:25.316 --> 04:24:27.184
PEOPLE THAT ARE TRANSITIONING

04:24:27.251 --> 04:24:29.420
FROM OF A LIVING ARRANGEMENT

04:24:29.486 --> 04:24:30.754
BACK TO LOOK AT A LOWER LEVEL OF

04:24:30.821 --> 04:24:32.056
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

04:24:32.122 --> 04:24:33.390
SHOULD BE THE SAME AS FOR PEOPLE

04:24:33.457 --> 04:24:34.692
MOVING OUT OF DEVELOPMENTAL

04:24:34.758 --> 04:24:36.493
CENTERS WHICH IS FOR A YEAR OR

04:24:36.560 --> 04:24:38.262
SO BOTH KNEW THAT IN THE

04:24:38.329 --> 04:24:39.263
FACILITY.

04:24:39.330 --> 04:24:40.030
WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR

04:24:40.097 --> 04:24:41.765
PLACEMENT BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT

04:24:41.832 --> 04:24:43.701
WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING AND YOU

04:24:43.767 --> 04:24:45.302
MIGHT BE MOST AT RISK OF A RE

04:24:45.369 --> 04:24:46.537
OCCURRENCE?

04:24:46.604 --> 04:24:49.006
I'M GONNA QUICKLY TALK ABOUT --

04:24:49.073 --> 04:24:50.507
THREE THINGS THAT THE R. C. IS

04:24:50.574 --> 04:24:52.109
INTERESTED IN.

04:24:52.176 --> 04:24:57.948
BUT FIRST IS -- AS OF A DIRECTOR --

04:24:58.015 --> 04:24:59.049
HEATHER NOTED ON THAT -- FLOORS

04:24:59.116 --> 04:25:00.851

04:25:00.918 --> 04:25:03.087
DOLLARS TO ALLOW REGIONAL CENTER

04:25:03.153 --> 04:25:05.322
PILOTS THAT WILL LOOK AT NEW

04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:08.559
WAYS OF PROVIDING SERVICES --

04:25:08.626 --> 04:25:10.294
FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BOTH

04:25:10.361 --> 04:25:11.462
DEVELOPMENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

04:25:11.528 --> 04:25:13.330
DISABILITIES SOMETIMES IT MAKES

04:25:13.397 --> 04:25:15.332
SENSE TO LOOK AT WHAT LOCAL

04:25:15.399 --> 04:25:16.900
FOLKS KNOW THE NEEDS ARE HOW

04:25:16.967 --> 04:25:18.369
THEY CAN COORDINATE WITH MENTAL

04:25:18.435 --> 04:25:19.703
HEALTH AGENCIES HOW THEY CAN

04:25:19.770 --> 04:25:20.704
DEVELOP.

04:25:20.771 --> 04:25:23.741
UP CAPACITY THE SECOND IS TO RE

04:25:23.807 --> 04:25:26.577

THE DESIGN OF THE COMMUNITY

04:28:43.841 --> 04:28:44.942
CRISIS HOME FOR CHILDREN IS

04:28:45.008 --> 04:28:46.477

THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS THAT

04:29:12.503 --> 04:29:14.071

TWENTY IS THAT ALL OF WHILE WE

04:29:21.845 --> 04:29:22.412
WILL STILL DO SOME THE COMMUNITY

04:29:22.479 --> 04:29:23.514
DEVELOPMENT.

04:29:23.580 --> 04:29:25.716
THE PRIORITY IN THE GUIDELINES

04:29:25.782 --> 04:29:27.417
AS ABOUT THE SAFETY NET.

04:29:27.484 --> 04:29:28.952
SO MAKING SURE THAT THE REGIONAL

04:29:29.019 --> 04:29:30.654
CENTERS ARE DEVELOPING FIRST

04:29:30.721 --> 04:29:32.155
WORLD IN APPROVED FIRST ALL OF

04:29:32.222 --> 04:29:33.891
THE SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE

04:29:33.957 --> 04:29:35.526
WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS IT'S

04:29:35.592 --> 04:29:36.994
NOT GOING TO MEET ALL THE NEEDS.

04:29:37.060 --> 04:29:38.262
BUT THEY ALL NEED TO TAKE AN

04:29:38.328 --> 04:29:39.663
INVENTORY OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE

04:29:39.730 --> 04:29:41.365
WITHIN THEIR AREA AND WE'RE

04:29:41.431 --> 04:29:42.466
GOING TO PRIORITIZE THAT

04:29:42.533 --> 04:29:43.467
DEVELOPMENT.

04:29:43.534 --> 04:29:45.068
SO I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW IT'S

04:29:45.135 --> 04:29:46.403
A LONG DISCUSSION THAT WE CAN

04:29:46.470 --> 04:29:47.704
CERTAINLY HAVE IS TO THOSE

04:29:47.771 --> 04:29:49.806
STRATEGIES -- BUT THE OTHER

04:29:49.873 --> 04:29:51.108
PIECES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

04:29:51.174 --> 04:29:52.142
PILOTING MORE WORKING WITH TO

04:29:52.209 --> 04:29:54.111
REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE GOING

04:29:54.177 --> 04:29:55.412
TO BE PILOTING KIND OF A NEW

04:29:55.479 --> 04:29:58.782
MODEL THAT IS MORE OF A INFORMED.

04:29:58.849 --> 04:30:01.184
CREDIT -- TRAUMA FOCUSED --

04:30:01.251 --> 04:30:03.120
SUPPORT SYSTEM SO BECAUSE OF

04:30:03.186 --> 04:30:04.454
THAT THAT STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS

04:30:04.521 --> 04:30:06.490
THAT WE HAD WITH WITH FAMILY

04:30:06.557 --> 04:30:07.291
MEMBERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING

04:30:07.357 --> 04:30:09.293
THIS MOST COMPLEX SITUATIONS

04:30:09.359 --> 04:30:10.661
THAT ARE VERY DEVASTATING TO

04:30:10.727 --> 04:30:11.628
THEM.

04:30:11.695 --> 04:30:13.163
IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE

04:30:13.230 --> 04:30:14.998
SOME OF THOSE STEPS SO OUR FIRST

04:30:15.065 --> 04:30:16.366
STEP IS PILOTING A COUPLE OF

04:30:16.433 --> 04:30:17.668
THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN

04:30:17.734 --> 04:30:19.069
WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST.

04:30:19.136 --> 04:30:22.339
THAT IS WITHIN OUR CURRENT

04:30:22.406 --> 04:30:23.640
PRIORITIZE SEEN OUR COMMUNITY

04:30:23.707 --> 04:30:25.008
PLACEMENT PLAN FUNDS FOR THESE

04:30:25.075 --> 04:30:27.644
PURPOSES DEVELOPING TO STATE

04:30:27.711 --> 04:30:30.113
OPERATED -- COMMUNITY KIRK TO

04:30:30.180 --> 04:30:32.449
STATE OPERATED CRISIS SERVICES

04:30:32.516 --> 04:30:34.451
OUR STAR HOMES BETTER FOCUS JUST

04:30:34.518 --> 04:30:36.119
FOR CHILDREN AND THEN STARTING

04:30:36.186 --> 04:30:38.622
WITH THOSE THREE HOMES BY WAY OF

04:30:38.689 --> 04:30:40.657
HAVING A NEW LICENSE CATEGORY WE

04:30:40.724 --> 04:30:42.559
CAN EXPAND BEYOND THOSE THREE

04:30:42.626 --> 04:30:45.062
HOMES AS JUST TO START.

04:30:45.128 --> 04:30:48.765
SO IT'S YES -- AND IT I THINK.

04:30:48.832 --> 04:30:52.970
YOU MADE SOME COMMENT ABOUT THIS --

04:30:53.036 --> 04:30:56.673
TO IS IS THAT -- I THINK IT'S

04:30:56.740 --> 04:30:58.108
HELPFUL TO SAY OKAY WHAT IS THIS

04:30:58.175 --> 04:30:58.875
NEW MODEL GOING TO BE RIGHT

04:30:58.942 --> 04:30:59.376
BECAUSE WE HAVE LOTS OF

04:30:59.443 --> 04:31:00.177
DIFFERENT PIECES YOU HAVE YOUR

04:31:00.243 --> 04:31:01.612
STAR HOMES RIGHT WHICH IS BEING

04:31:01.678 --> 04:31:03.614
OPERATED BY THE STATE.

04:31:03.680 --> 04:31:04.548
THERE ARE ABLE TO SELL RIGHT AND

04:31:04.615 --> 04:31:06.650
THEN YOU HAVE YOUR REGIONAL

04:31:06.717 --> 04:31:08.418
CENTERS.

04:31:08.485 --> 04:31:09.553
TO WHILE ALSO TAKING OUT THAT

04:31:09.620 --> 04:31:10.621
AND THAT AND THIS AND THE SOURCE

04:31:10.687 --> 04:31:11.888
SPECTRUM THAT THEY'LL TAKE IN

04:31:11.955 --> 04:31:13.690
EXACTLY WHAT YOU KNOW UP TO WHAT

04:31:13.757 --> 04:31:15.225
POINT AND MAYBE VARIES A LITTLE

04:31:15.292 --> 04:31:16.627
BIT BY REGIONAL CENTER.

04:31:16.693 --> 04:31:18.362
EXACTLY HOW WHAT POINT SEVERITY

04:31:18.428 --> 04:31:20.430
CAN THEY HANDLE RIGHT IN TERMS

04:31:20.497 --> 04:31:21.999
OF AND WHAT CUT FACILITIES WILL

04:31:22.065 --> 04:31:23.367
THEY BE OPERATING BECAUSE YOU'RE

04:31:23.433 --> 04:31:25.402
RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST THE STAR

04:31:25.469 --> 04:31:26.336
HOME SO WITH SO WHERE'S THAT

04:31:26.403 --> 04:31:28.505
INTERFACES IS GOING TO BE IN

04:31:28.572 --> 04:31:32.009
TERMS OF BETWEEN.

04:31:32.075 --> 04:31:33.877
AND I DON'T KNOW IS IS IS THIS

04:31:33.944 --> 04:31:35.278
IS THE FUTURE.

04:31:35.345 --> 04:31:36.780
FOR YOU PLAIN.

04:31:36.847 --> 04:31:38.415
TO FILLED OUT MORE OR STAR HOMES

04:31:38.482 --> 04:31:40.017
IN THE LONG TERM OR IS IT GOING

04:31:40.083 --> 04:31:41.918
TO BE MORE WELL ACTUALLY HESE

04:31:41.985 --> 04:31:43.220
ARE MODELS THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA

04:31:43.286 --> 04:31:45.055
TRANSITION TO REGIONAL CENTERS

04:31:45.122 --> 04:31:45.889
REGIONAL CENTERS ON THE BE

04:31:45.956 --> 04:31:54.264
OPERATING HOW MANY CRISIS SOME

04:31:54.331 --> 04:31:54.431
SO.

04:31:54.498 --> 04:31:55.632
I MEAN.

04:31:55.699 --> 04:31:56.667
AND YOU MAY BE STILL FIGURING

04:31:56.733 --> 04:31:58.402
SOME OF THAT OUT US IN EXACTLY

04:31:58.468 --> 04:32:00.003
AND HOW MANY HOW MANY OF THEM WE

04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.771
GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE

04:32:00.837 --> 04:32:02.005
CURRENT ACUITY AND WHERE WE

04:32:02.072 --> 04:32:02.439
THINK THAT'S GOING.

04:32:02.506 --> 04:32:03.940
HOW MANY?

04:32:04.007 --> 04:32:05.809
FACILITIES DO WE NEED AN OPERATE

04:32:05.876 --> 04:32:08.378
BY WHOM SO AND THAT IS SO LEAD

04:32:08.445 --> 04:32:10.213
TO HELPFUL TO HAVE A BETTER

04:32:10.280 --> 04:32:15.318
SENSE OF THAT -- YEAH OF THE THE

04:32:15.385 --> 04:32:16.787
IT DID IT WOULD BE ON THE NEXT

04:32:16.853 --> 04:32:17.688
YEAR OR SO WHEN WE START TALKING

04:32:17.754 --> 04:32:18.388
ABOUT OUR SOMETIME IN THE COMING

04:32:18.455 --> 04:32:20.023
YEAR LIKE WHAT WHAT IS THE SORT

04:32:20.090 --> 04:32:21.158
OF THE OVERALL PLAN I. V. ON

04:32:21.224 --> 04:32:22.359
THIS IS THE THIS IS THE INITIAL

04:32:22.426 --> 04:32:23.927
SAFETY NET SELLING CRISIS

04:32:23.994 --> 04:32:24.194
SERVICES.

04:32:24.261 --> 04:32:28.398
BUT WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE WERE

04:32:28.465 --> 04:32:30.200
WE GOING TO THE YOU KNOW WE WERE.

04:32:30.267 --> 04:32:30.834
HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA BE FUNNY

04:32:30.901 --> 04:32:32.703
YOU SOME MORE STAFF TO LOOK AT

04:32:32.769 --> 04:32:34.738
SOME OF THE STUFF BUT I MEAN

04:32:34.805 --> 04:32:35.472
JUST.

04:32:35.539 --> 04:32:36.306
WHAT WHAT?

04:32:36.373 --> 04:32:37.974
WHERE WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE

04:32:38.041 --> 04:32:39.409
PLAN THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD

04:32:39.476 --> 04:32:40.711
HOW ME AND AT LEAST A BASELINE

04:32:40.777 --> 04:32:42.479
OF DATA ABOUT HOW MANY?

04:32:42.546 --> 04:32:43.313
HOW MANY BEDS WHAT'S THERE HOW

04:32:43.380 --> 04:32:43.613
MANY?

04:32:43.680 --> 04:32:44.981
THINGS OF HOW WHAT SEVERITY DO

04:32:45.048 --> 04:32:46.983
WE NEED RIGHT S. NOW THAT WE'VE

04:32:47.050 --> 04:32:48.051
CLOSED OUT INCLUDING DOT

04:32:48.118 --> 04:32:48.719
DEVELOPMENTAL -- CENTERS OF WHAT

04:32:48.785 --> 04:32:50.153
WHAT WHAT WE HAVE OUT THERE AND

04:32:50.220 --> 04:32:51.688
WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD OUT TO AND

04:32:51.755 --> 04:32:52.923
HE'S GOING TO DO IT RIGHT HOW'S

04:32:52.989 --> 04:32:54.925
IT GOING TO BE DEVELOPMENTAL

04:32:54.991 --> 04:32:55.792
CENTER IS GOING TO GO UP THAT

04:32:55.859 --> 04:32:56.660
CERTAIN POINT.

04:32:56.727 --> 04:32:58.228
STATES CAN DO CERTAIN POINT

04:32:58.295 --> 04:33:05.302
CETERA I THINK SOME CLARITY

04:33:05.368 --> 04:33:07.170
THERE WOULD BE HELPFUL.

04:33:07.237 --> 04:33:07.971
YEAH AND AND REALLY MUCH OF THE

04:33:08.038 --> 04:33:09.172
THE INVENTORY THAT WE'RE GONNA

04:33:09.239 --> 04:33:10.774
BE DOING THROUGH THE CPP PLANS --

04:33:10.841 --> 04:33:11.808
IN THIS CYCLE IS GOING TO GIVE

04:33:11.875 --> 04:33:13.477
US SIGNIFICANT CLARITY AS TO

04:33:13.543 --> 04:33:14.978
WHERE WE ARE AND WE DO HAVE IN

04:33:15.045 --> 04:33:16.580
INVENTORY CURRENTLY.

04:33:16.646 --> 04:33:17.948
BUT REALLY KIND OF EXPANDING

04:33:18.014 --> 04:33:19.316
THAT WITH EACH OF THE REGIONAL

04:33:19.382 --> 04:33:20.617
CENTERS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT

04:33:20.684 --> 04:33:23.086
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

04:33:23.153 --> 04:33:24.788
WE REALLY DO HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK

04:33:24.855 --> 04:33:27.090
AT MULTIPLE APPROACHES.

04:33:27.157 --> 04:33:29.793
I MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE FROM

04:33:29.860 --> 04:33:32.629
PREVENTATIVE SUPPORT SERVICES TO

04:33:32.696 --> 04:33:34.131
MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE WE

04:33:34.197 --> 04:33:36.366
HAVE THE EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO

04:33:36.433 --> 04:33:38.101
HAVE THAT SUPPORT. TO REALLY

04:33:38.168 --> 04:33:40.137
REDUCE THE RISK OF HAVING SOME A

04:33:40.203 --> 04:33:42.239
CHILD HAVING TO GO OUT OF HOME

04:33:42.305 --> 04:33:45.275
INTO A CRISIS SERVICE BUT

04:33:45.342 --> 04:33:46.843
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE WERE SEEN.

04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:50.213
IN THE INCREASE OF OF REQUEST --

04:33:50.280 --> 04:33:52.015
FOR MORE STATE OPERATED SUPPORT

04:33:52.082 --> 04:33:53.950
SERVICES IS REALLY WHAT GAVE US

04:33:54.017 --> 04:33:55.018
THE INDICATION THAT WE

04:33:55.085 --> 04:33:56.520
IMMEDIATELY NEEDED TO TAKE A

04:33:56.586 --> 04:33:58.488
LOOK AT WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL IN

04:33:58.555 --> 04:33:59.656
ABILITY AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE

04:33:59.723 --> 04:34:01.792
SEEING THE THREE HOMES ASKING

04:34:01.858 --> 04:34:02.359
FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS HOME

04:34:02.425 --> 04:34:03.226
LICENSE.

04:34:03.293 --> 04:34:04.694
SO WE CAN HELP THE REGIONAL

04:34:04.761 --> 04:34:06.797
CENTERS TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP

04:34:06.863 --> 04:34:08.098
WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY THESE

04:34:08.165 --> 04:34:09.866
OPTIONS AND HAVE THOSE RESOURCES

04:34:09.933 --> 04:34:11.701
AVAILABLE -- BUT A GREAT IN

04:34:11.768 --> 04:34:13.069
TAKING A LOOK AT KIND OF A

04:34:13.136 --> 04:34:14.704
MAPPING OF THE STATE AND HAD A

04:34:14.771 --> 04:34:17.307
WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT THE FUTURE

04:34:17.374 --> 04:34:19.509
NEEDS ARE ALSO SERVE THEM.

04:34:19.576 --> 04:34:21.311
SO WHAT'S THE DEMAND ALRIGHT SO

04:34:21.378 --> 04:34:22.112
THERE'S AND THEN THERE'S

04:34:22.179 --> 04:34:23.346
INVENTORIES LIKE WHAT ARE

04:34:23.413 --> 04:34:24.915
CAPACITY IS WHAT'S THE DEMAND

04:34:24.981 --> 04:34:26.983
AND THEN THE SERVER ROADMAP OF

04:34:27.050 --> 04:34:28.618
US WERE BIG REALLY GOING INTO

04:34:28.685 --> 04:34:29.452
THIS NEW WORLD RIGHT WITH THE

04:34:29.519 --> 04:34:30.921
CLOSING DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

04:34:30.987 --> 04:34:32.622
BUILDING.

04:34:32.689 --> 04:34:33.156
THEY'LL THIS PROPOSAL THE

04:34:33.223 --> 04:34:35.325
SICKNESSES ELISE -- WE'RE

04:34:35.392 --> 04:34:36.493
TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE REGIONAL

04:34:36.560 --> 04:34:37.661
CENTERS IN A ROLE HOW THE

04:34:37.727 --> 04:34:39.196
INTERFACE RATE -- ARE NOT

04:34:39.262 --> 04:34:40.964
DEPENDING ON THE LOCATIONS AND

04:34:41.031 --> 04:34:42.632
SO FORTH -- ANY OF THE MOBILE

04:34:42.699 --> 04:34:51.241
CRISIS TEMA HOW'S THAT FIT INTO

04:34:51.308 --> 04:34:52.909
THIS PICTURE SO.

04:34:52.976 --> 04:34:53.743
IN THE END AND I THINK PEOPLE

04:34:53.810 --> 04:34:55.345
ALSO NEED SOME CLARITY SO THAT

04:34:55.412 --> 04:34:57.214
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BECAUSE

04:34:57.280 --> 04:34:58.381
OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA HAVE GAPS

04:34:58.448 --> 04:35:00.984
RIGHT I MEAN -- SO OF SOMEONE'S

04:35:01.051 --> 04:35:01.885
GOT LIKE WHAT'S NOT MINE IS NOT

04:35:01.952 --> 04:35:04.721
MINE AND THEN FOR FAMILY STOCK

04:35:04.788 --> 04:35:05.822
RIGHT AND SO [inaudible]

04:35:05.889 --> 04:35:07.891
OKAY.

04:35:07.958 --> 04:35:08.458

04:35:40.056 --> 04:35:41.558
IT'S HARD TO HEAR THE THE OF A

04:35:41.625 --> 04:35:46.529
PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS COMMENTING

PERSON CENTER PRACTICES IN.

04:40:09.025 --> 04:40:10.093
AS IT RELATES CITIES RULES THE

04:40:10.160 --> 04:40:11.327
PARCHMENT SOON GOING TO BE

04:40:11.394 --> 04:40:14.297
ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT WITH A

INFORMATION IN THAT AREA AS WELL

04:40:20.737 --> 04:40:22.338
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST SUCH A

04:40:22.405 --> 04:40:25.742
CRITICAL ROLE -- PERSON CENTERED --

04:40:25.808 --> 04:40:28.511
THINKING AND PRACTICES ARE SUCH

04:40:28.578 --> 04:40:31.181
A CRITICAL -- PIECE OF MEETING

04:40:31.247 --> 04:40:31.915
THESE REQUIREMENTS SO WE

04:40:31.981 --> 04:40:33.716
REALIZED THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING

04:40:33.783 --> 04:40:35.985
THAT WE HAD TO DO AS WELL.

04:40:36.052 --> 04:40:37.420
SO IT IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING

04:40:37.487 --> 04:40:38.521
THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS

04:40:38.588 --> 04:40:40.723
PROPOSAL ON ALL THOSE STEPS ARE

04:40:40.790 --> 04:40:43.293
STILL MORE TO DO -- ONE OF THE

04:40:43.359 --> 04:40:45.795
THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU HAD IN

04:40:45.862 --> 04:40:46.596
YOUR AGENDA AS ABOUT THE

04:40:46.663 --> 04:40:49.399
HEIGHTENED REVIEW PROCESS OR IS --

04:40:49.465 --> 04:40:50.967
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALLS IT

04:40:51.034 --> 04:40:53.069
HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY -- WHICH

04:40:53.136 --> 04:40:54.404
JUST THE WORDING OF THAT

04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:56.539
OBVIOUSLY CREATES -- A LOT OF

04:40:56.606 --> 04:40:58.508
CONCERN RIGHT BECAUSE BEFORE

04:40:58.575 --> 04:40:59.776
THAT WHAT REALLY GOES UNDER

04:40:59.842 --> 04:41:01.177
QUOTE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY.

04:41:01.244 --> 04:41:03.479
IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD -- WHAT --

04:41:03.546 --> 04:41:05.081
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELATED --

04:41:05.148 --> 04:41:07.784
LABEL AS A PLACE IT IS PRESUMED

04:41:07.850 --> 04:41:09.185
INSTITUTIONAL.

04:41:09.252 --> 04:41:11.287
SO WHAT IT BUT IT REALLY THAN

04:41:11.354 --> 04:41:14.324
MEANS FOR FOLKS WHEN YOU READ

04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:15.024
THAT IS THAT.

04:41:15.091 --> 04:41:16.726
YOU'RE PRESUMED GUILTY AND LESS

04:41:16.793 --> 04:41:18.328
AFTER WE REALLY REALLY LOOK

04:41:18.394 --> 04:41:20.730
CLOSE YOU CAN PROVE THAT YOU'RE

04:41:20.797 --> 04:41:23.099
NOT -- SO THAT OBVIOUSLY CREATES

04:41:23.166 --> 04:41:24.534
A LOT OF CONCERN FOR US AND SO

04:41:24.601 --> 04:41:25.602
IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

04:41:25.668 --> 04:41:27.103
REALLY BEEN TRYING TO TAKE A

04:41:27.170 --> 04:41:29.439
MAJOR LOOK AT IN DEVELOPING WHAT

04:41:29.505 --> 04:41:30.974
THAT PROCESS IS.

04:41:31.040 --> 04:41:33.676
BECAUSE TO WE HAD TO WHAT WHAT

04:41:33.743 --> 04:41:37.947
FALLS UNDER THAT -- PROCESS ARE

04:41:38.014 --> 04:41:39.916
PLACES THAT THE FEDERAL

04:41:39.983 --> 04:41:41.818
GOVERNMENT HAS SAID -- TEND TO

04:41:41.884 --> 04:41:43.519
ISOLATE.

04:41:43.586 --> 04:41:46.122
AND SO INITIAL GUIDANCE FROM THE

04:41:46.189 --> 04:41:48.858
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS --

04:41:48.925 --> 04:41:50.126
ACTUALLY.

04:41:50.193 --> 04:41:51.561
HAD A LITTLE BIT EVEN CREATED

04:41:51.628 --> 04:41:53.863
MORE CONFUSION AND WHEN READ

04:41:53.930 --> 04:41:56.232
LITERALLY ONE COULD EVEN THINK

04:41:56.299 --> 04:41:58.534
THAT -- PLACES THAT WERE WORLD

04:41:58.601 --> 04:42:00.670
THAT WE'RE NOT LOCATED NEAR --

04:42:00.737 --> 04:42:02.672
PUBLIC AND OR WERE NOT LOCATED

04:42:02.739 --> 04:42:04.407
NEAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

04:42:04.474 --> 04:42:07.810
FIT INTO THIS -- THIS THIS

04:42:07.877 --> 04:42:10.246
REVIEW PROCESS WHICH OF COURSE

04:42:10.313 --> 04:42:11.814
CREATED EVEN MORE CONFUSION

04:42:11.881 --> 04:42:14.017
KNOWING THAT -- THE FEDERAL

04:42:14.083 --> 04:42:16.419
GOVERNMENT HAD FOR A LONG TIME --

04:42:16.486 --> 04:42:17.987
INDICATED THAT FURTHER GUIDANCE

04:42:18.054 --> 04:42:18.955
WOULD BE COMING OUT WE REALLY

04:42:19.022 --> 04:42:20.356
WERE WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT

NEXT WEEK IN OUR RATE STUDY

04:43:34.630 --> 04:43:36.165
DISCUSSION AND THAT IS.

04:43:36.232 --> 04:43:38.034
THAT IN GENERAL THERE MAY NEED

04:43:38.101 --> 04:43:40.436
TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM THE

04:43:40.503 --> 04:43:41.871
DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHICH SERVICE

04:43:41.938 --> 04:43:43.406
CATEGORIES IT DOES NOT CONSIDER

04:43:43.473 --> 04:43:45.375

04:44:00.456 --> 04:44:02.258
BIRD DOESN'T HAVE TO GO -- IT'S

04:44:02.325 --> 04:44:04.160
SORT OF UNCLEAR AND SO I THINK

04:44:04.227 --> 04:44:05.361

OR GROUP FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

04:45:09.192 --> 04:45:10.960
BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE NEED

TO BE MUCH MORE GUIDANCE COMING

04:45:12.929 --> 04:45:13.529

MEANS.

04:45:19.569 --> 04:45:21.204
AND ONE THING WE WOULD ST

04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:23.272
SUGGEST SAYS AFTER BI BI MONTHLY

ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE

04:45:32.081 --> 04:45:33.349
TALKED TO SOME OF THE GRANTEES

04:45:33.416 --> 04:45:35.551
IS THAT THERE'S CONFUSION ABOUT

04:45:35.618 --> 04:45:36.652
YOU KNOW WHETHER WHAT THEY'RE

04:45:36.719 --> 04:45:39.322

COMPLIANCE OR THEY'RE RUNNING

04:45:40.556 --> 04:45:42.325
INTO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

04:45:42.391 --> 04:45:45.194
WHAT'S THE THE REGIONAL CENTER --

04:45:45.261 --> 04:45:46.229
PERSON AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY

04:45:46.295 --> 04:45:48.130
THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER PERSONS

04:45:48.197 --> 04:45:49.765
A BAD PERSON IS JUST MEANS OUT.

04:45:49.832 --> 04:45:50.333
THE CONFERENCE CALLED WOULD

04:45:50.399 --> 04:45:52.235
PROMOTE MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP

04:45:52.301 --> 04:45:53.202
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY AN

04:45:53.269 --> 04:45:54.937
EXCITING THING IF WE WORK AT

04:45:55.004 --> 04:45:56.973
RIGHT. TO TRANSFORMING OUR

04:45:57.039 --> 04:46:00.576

LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO WHAT IT

04:46:10.052 --> 04:46:12.054
THE LACK OF INFORMATION PROMOTE

04:46:12.121 --> 04:46:13.990
SO.

04:46:14.056 --> 04:46:15.558
A LOT OF FEAR AND ANXIETY -- AND

04:46:15.625 --> 04:46:17.293
ALSO -- I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF

04:46:17.360 --> 04:46:18.761
THE GRANTEES.

04:46:18.828 --> 04:46:20.663
SOMETIMES -- SOME OF THE GRANTS

04:46:20.730 --> 04:46:22.365
ARE TREATED MORE AS A PROGRAM

04:46:22.431 --> 04:46:23.733
AND NOT AS A GRANT AND THEREFORE

04:46:23.799 --> 04:46:25.835
IT IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE HARDER.

04:46:25.902 --> 04:46:28.738
TO IMPLEMENT THE GRANT -- SECOND

04:46:28.804 --> 04:46:30.640
DATE CBS FINAL RULE INCLUDES

04:46:34.510 --> 04:46:36.345
PROCESS WHICH JIM SPOKE OF IN AT

04:46:36.412 --> 04:46:37.413
THIS DONE THE RIGHT WAY CAN HAVE

04:46:37.480 --> 04:46:39.615
BE A SIGNIFICANT TOOL IN PROCESS

04:46:39.682 --> 04:46:40.182
TO ALIGNING.

04:46:40.249 --> 04:46:42.718
WHAT A PERSON WANTS AND NEEDS?

04:46:42.785 --> 04:46:44.353
TO WHAT SERVICES SUPPORTS CAN BE

04:46:44.420 --> 04:46:52.895
PROVIDED MEASURED BY OUTCOMES

04:46:52.962 --> 04:46:54.664
AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T WHAT IT IS

04:46:54.730 --> 04:46:55.331
AND SO WE WOULD SUGGEST.

04:46:55.398 --> 04:46:56.899
THAT THE DEPARTMENT IN KERR --

04:46:56.966 --> 04:46:58.868

04:47:04.040 --> 04:47:05.541
THIRD.

04:47:05.608 --> 04:47:08.244
SOME SETTINGS AS A THE HE'LL

04:47:08.311 --> 04:47:09.779
ELLIE -- JUST MENTION MAY OR MAY

04:47:09.845 --> 04:47:11.781
NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE H.

04:47:11.847 --> 04:47:13.015
E. B. AS FINAL RULE.

04:47:13.082 --> 04:47:14.884
IT IS NOT FAIR TO THE WORKERS OF

04:47:14.951 --> 04:47:16.519
THE PEOPLE IN THOSE TYPES OF

04:47:16.586 --> 04:47:18.554
SETTINGS. TO BE CONTINUED TO

04:47:18.621 --> 04:47:20.323
CONTINUE YEAR AFTER YEAR NOT

KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE

04:47:21.157 --> 04:47:22.491
SETTING WOULD EVER BE IN

04:47:22.558 --> 04:47:23.793
COMPLIANCE THE STATE OF

04:47:23.859 --> 04:47:25.027
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO THE

04:47:25.094 --> 04:47:26.696
LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE

04:47:26.762 --> 04:47:27.730
ADMINISTRATION NEEDS.

04:47:27.797 --> 04:47:28.864
TO KIND OF MOVE FORWARD ON SOME

04:47:28.931 --> 04:47:30.933
POLICY ISSUES AND TERM AND TO

04:47:31.000 --> 04:47:32.068
DETERMINE WHETHER THE CERTAIN

04:47:32.134 --> 04:47:34.537
SETTING IS ACTUALLY NO LONGER.

04:47:34.604 --> 04:47:36.005
WHAT WE NEED TO BE AND THAT WE

04:47:36.072 --> 04:47:37.373
SHOULD TRANSITION THOSE

04:47:37.440 --> 04:47:39.241
INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WORKERS

04:47:39.308 --> 04:47:40.576
INTO A?

04:47:40.643 --> 04:47:42.979
A A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SETTING

04:47:43.045 --> 04:47:44.747
THAT IS THAT IS COMPLIANT AND

04:47:44.814 --> 04:47:46.515
USE THE SAME TYPE OF PROCESS AND

04:47:46.582 --> 04:47:47.917
SENSITIVITY THAT WE USE WHEN WE

04:47:47.984 --> 04:47:49.318
CLOSE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

04:47:49.385 --> 04:47:51.120
MEANING WE TREATED THE STAFF AS

04:47:51.187 --> 04:47:52.355
WELL AS THE PEOPLE RECEIVING

04:47:52.421 --> 04:47:53.889
SERVICES WITH RESPECT.

04:47:53.956 --> 04:47:56.425
AND TO TRY TO MAINTAIN THEIR

04:47:56.492 --> 04:47:58.094
LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND MOVING

04:47:58.160 --> 04:48:02.999
THEM INTO A COMMUNITY LASTLY.

04:48:03.065 --> 04:48:03.733
FUNDING IS A MAJOR BARRIER FOR

04:48:03.799 --> 04:48:04.567
PROVIDERS AND THE PEOPLE THEY

04:48:04.634 --> 04:48:05.801
SERVE IN TRANSITIONING TO

04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:07.470
COMPLIANCE AT THAT WE SUGGEST

04:48:07.536 --> 04:48:08.738
THAT YOU WOULD TARGET.

04:48:08.804 --> 04:48:10.406
OR THE STATE TARGET SO FUNDING

04:48:10.473 --> 04:48:11.741
INCREASES TO THOSE PEOPLE TO

04:48:11.807 --> 04:48:13.275
THOSE PROVIDERS WHO ARE

04:48:13.342 --> 04:48:14.443
COMPLIANT OR IN PROCESS OF

04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:16.679
TRANSITION TOWARD COMPLIANCE

TO THE COMMITTEE.

04:48:37.299 --> 04:48:38.501
I'D LIKE TO OFFER A WAY TO THINK

04:48:38.567 --> 04:48:40.770
ABOUT WHAT AN INSTITUTION IS AND

04:48:40.836 --> 04:48:42.038
WHAT CAN BE ISOLATING FOR THE

04:48:42.104 --> 04:48:43.639
PEOPLE WE SERVE.

04:48:43.706 --> 04:48:45.174
THE MORE THE ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON

04:48:45.241 --> 04:48:46.642
THE NEEDS OF THE STAFF THE MORE

04:48:46.709 --> 04:48:49.945
LIKELY IT IS IT'S AN INSTITUTION.

04:48:50.012 --> 04:48:51.047
WHEN WE BECOME CENTERED ON THE

04:48:51.113 --> 04:48:52.848
PERSON WERE SERVING?

04:48:52.915 --> 04:48:54.717
WE MOVE TOWARD LESS

04:48:54.784 --> 04:48:56.385
INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS.

04:48:56.452 --> 04:48:57.787
I ALSO BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE

04:48:57.853 --> 04:48:59.889
VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PHILOSOPHIES

04:48:59.955 --> 04:49:02.124
AND POLICIES WE PROMOTE.

04:49:02.191 --> 04:49:03.392
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WE SUPPORT

04:49:03.459 --> 04:49:05.027
HAVE THE SMALLEST ARE NO

04:49:05.094 --> 04:49:06.662
POLITICAL VOICE.

04:49:06.729 --> 04:49:07.763
AND ARE AMONG THE MOST

04:49:07.830 --> 04:49:10.433
MARGINALIZED AND IMPOVERISHED.

04:49:10.499 --> 04:49:11.734
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE POWER

04:49:11.801 --> 04:49:12.968
THAT WE HAVE AS WE ADVOCATE FOR

04:49:13.035 --> 04:49:15.071
THEM.

04:49:15.137 --> 04:49:16.639
MY REMARKS TODAY FOCUS ON

04:49:16.706 --> 04:49:18.941
WHETHER PROVIDERS FEEL PREPARED

04:49:19.008 --> 04:49:20.342
FOR MARCH.

04:49:20.409 --> 04:49:20.976
TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN WILL BE

04:49:21.043 --> 04:49:22.511
EXPECTED BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH

04:49:22.578 --> 04:49:24.947
H. CBS SETTINGS REGULATIONS.

04:49:25.014 --> 04:49:27.583
ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO A

04:49:27.650 --> 04:49:30.619
SETTINGS WHICH MAY BE ISOLATING --

04:49:30.686 --> 04:49:32.455
ACCORDING TO AGE CBS.

04:49:32.521 --> 04:49:33.723
I THINK THEY'RE BIG UNANSWERED

04:49:33.789 --> 04:49:34.757
QUESTIONS THAT I HEAR FROM

04:49:34.824 --> 04:49:37.059
PROVIDERS WHEN WE HAVE THE SELF

04:49:37.126 --> 04:49:38.794
ASSESSMENTS OF OUR PROGRAM SO WE

04:49:38.861 --> 04:49:40.663
CAN FIND OUT IF WE APPEAR TO BE

04:49:40.730 --> 04:49:42.198
COMPLIANT TO THE REGULATIONS.

04:49:42.264 --> 04:49:43.966
ACCORDING TO OURSELVES.

04:49:44.033 --> 04:49:44.734
WHEN WE KNOW IF WE'VE

04:49:44.800 --> 04:49:46.802
INTERPRETED THE SELF ASSESSMENT

04:49:46.869 --> 04:49:48.370
CORRECTLY ACCORDING TO THE STATE?

04:49:48.437 --> 04:49:49.905
WHEN WE KNOW WHAT PROGRAMS A

04:49:49.972 --> 04:49:51.240
STATE WILL SELECT FOR FURTHER

04:49:51.307 --> 04:49:52.408

04:49:52.475 --> 04:49:53.676
WHEN ALL STATE TELL US IF THEY

04:49:53.743 --> 04:49:55.311
ARE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF

04:49:55.377 --> 04:49:57.580
ISOLATING BEYOND THE FEDERAL

04:49:57.646 --> 04:49:59.181

04:49:59.248 --> 04:50:00.683

04:50:02.318 --> 04:50:04.787
THEREFORE NOT COMPLIANT?

04:50:04.854 --> 04:50:05.788

04:50:23.139 --> 04:50:24.340
CONFLICT WITH BEING LESS

04:50:24.406 --> 04:50:26.208

04:50:26.275 --> 04:50:27.610
HOW CAN WE INNOVATE AND DEVELOP

04:50:27.676 --> 04:50:30.246

I DO AGREE THAT THE

04:52:02.137 --> 04:52:04.039

BECAUSE IT'S POSSIBLE THERE'S

04:53:48.444 --> 04:53:49.712
THINGS GET LOST IN TRANSLATION.

04:53:49.778 --> 04:53:51.046
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

04:55:20.803 --> 04:55:21.370
WOULD GO BY THE BOARD OF

04:55:21.437 --> 04:55:22.204
DIRECTORS BUT ALSO THEY HAVE TO

04:55:22.271 --> 04:55:23.605
TALK WITH THEIR FAMILIES AT

04:55:23.672 --> 04:55:24.339
THEIR SERVING.

04:55:24.406 --> 04:55:26.141
WITH THE PEOPLE THERE SERVING IN

04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:27.543
HIS ANXIETY LEVEL THERE AGAIN I

04:55:27.609 --> 04:55:28.010
YOU KNOW I PLUGGED THE

04:55:28.077 --> 04:55:29.211
DEPARTMENT FOR TRYING TO WORK

04:55:30.746 --> 04:55:32.147
UNCERTAINTY.

04:55:32.214 --> 04:55:33.348
OF AND ANDERS PROVIDERS WHO ARE

04:55:33.415 --> 04:55:35.150
TRYING TO MOVE ON THEIR OWN TO

04:55:35.217 --> 04:55:36.452
BE COMPLIANT.

04:55:36.518 --> 04:55:39.321
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

04:55:39.388 --> 04:55:45.961
AND AND SO TO YOUR POINT.

04:55:46.028 --> 04:55:47.229
AND ALSO LEGISLATURE CAN DO

04:55:47.296 --> 04:55:47.796
SOMETHING THEY CAN ACTUALLY

04:55:47.863 --> 04:55:48.664
INCORPORATE ALL THE GOOD

04:55:48.730 --> 04:55:50.732
ELEMENTS OF THE CBS ROLL INTO

04:55:50.799 --> 04:55:51.967
STATE LAW [inaudible]

THAT'S BUT I GUESS THERE'S NOT A

04:55:55.237 --> 04:55:56.371
BIG PLOT FOR THAT BUT IT BUT BUT

04:55:56.438 --> 04:55:57.873

04:56:04.947 --> 04:56:06.215
WHICH IS KIND OF THINKING OF A

04:56:06.281 --> 04:56:07.149
DOWN SO -- BECAUSE WELL I THINK

04:56:07.216 --> 04:56:07.783
WHAT WE WANT IS IS THAT WE WANT

04:56:07.850 --> 04:56:08.417
TO TRY TO GET AS MUCH LATITUDE

04:56:08.484 --> 04:56:10.619
AS POSSIBLE FROM THE FED SO THAT

04:56:10.686 --> 04:56:12.621
THE STATE CAN THEN HAVE LATITUDE

04:56:12.688 --> 04:56:14.790
TO WORK WITH BECAUSE RECOGNIZING

04:56:14.857 --> 04:56:17.392

GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE AND

04:56:22.865 --> 04:56:23.966
IS A SHOULD BE THE RIGHT THING

04:56:24.032 --> 04:56:25.400
TO DO BUT THAT AND THEY'RE

04:56:25.467 --> 04:56:26.535
TRYING TO MAKE IT SAID INSIDE A

04:56:26.602 --> 04:56:28.337

04:56:39.948 --> 04:56:41.850
FEDERAL AGENCY HOW STRICT THEY

04:56:41.917 --> 04:56:43.051
WANT TO BE AND THEN THAT HOW

04:56:43.118 --> 04:56:45.053
THAT GETS OPPOSED TO DOWN AT THE

04:56:45.120 --> 04:56:47.156
LOCAL LEVEL SO.

04:56:47.222 --> 04:56:48.023

04:58:28.557 --> 04:58:30.158
AND WE KNOW HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

04:58:30.225 --> 04:58:30.759
YEARS AGO THE BEST THING WE

04:58:30.826 --> 04:58:32.027
COULD DO IS PUT PEOPLE INTO

05:19:18.939 --> 05:19:20.374
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES

05:19:20.441 --> 05:19:22.643
IN PURCHASE OF SERVICE WHEN.

05:19:22.710 --> 05:19:25.412
PEOPLE ARE ON A SMALLER CASELOAD

05:19:25.479 --> 05:19:27.014
THAT'S TARGETED TO THEM.

05:19:27.081 --> 05:19:29.416
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE

05:19:29.483 --> 05:19:31.051
INTERVENTIONS ARE LIMITED TO

05:19:31.118 --> 05:19:32.753
VERY SMALL POPULATIONS.

05:19:32.820 --> 05:19:35.556
AND SO THE NEXT STEP IS ONCE WE

05:19:35.623 --> 05:19:37.057
CAN AGREE THAT INTERVENTIONS

05:19:37.124 --> 05:19:38.459
WORK.

05:19:38.526 --> 05:19:41.529
THROUGH ROBUST INFORMATION THAT

05:19:41.595 --> 05:19:43.731
THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS WE NEED

05:19:43.797 --> 05:19:44.865
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE NEXT

05:19:44.932 --> 05:19:46.867
STEP HOW DO WE TAKE THOSE

05:19:46.934 --> 05:19:48.335
TARGETED SMALL PILOTS.

05:19:48.402 --> 05:19:49.703
AND MAKE THEM MORE BROADLY

05:19:49.770 --> 05:19:51.839
AVAILABLE WE LOOK FORWARD TO

05:19:51.906 --> 05:19:53.240
WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS

05:19:53.307 --> 05:19:55.309
ADVOCACY GROUPS AND OTHERS TO

05:19:55.376 --> 05:19:56.710
THAT END.

05:19:56.777 --> 05:19:58.279
AND APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS

05:19:58.345 --> 05:20:00.481
OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED TO

05:20:00.548 --> 05:20:01.582
SIT DOWN AND MEET WITH US TO

05:20:01.649 --> 05:20:03.651
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE NEXT

05:20:03.717 --> 05:20:05.052
STEPS WERE WE CAN FIND.

05:20:05.119 --> 05:20:06.120
PLACES WHERE WE CAN WORK

05:20:06.186 --> 05:20:07.988
TOGETHER.

05:20:08.055 --> 05:20:10.324
WE AGREE THAT SERVICES AGAIN

05:20:10.391 --> 05:20:11.659
NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

05:20:11.725 --> 05:20:13.327
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO FAMILY AND

05:20:13.394 --> 05:20:15.162
CULTURAL PREFERENCES AND THAT

05:20:15.229 --> 05:20:17.398
THEY NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE AND

05:20:17.464 --> 05:20:19.133
AGAIN BACK TO THE ISSUE OF

05:20:19.199 --> 05:20:20.734
SOCIAL RECKON CAMP AS JUST AN

05:20:20.801 --> 05:20:22.670
EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE SERVICES

05:20:22.736 --> 05:20:24.038
THAT PEOPLE VALUE.

05:20:24.104 --> 05:20:26.240
THAT MAY NOT COST A LOT BUT MADE

05:20:26.307 --> 05:20:29.143
A BIG IMPACT IN THEIR LIVES

05:20:29.209 --> 05:20:29.743
THANK YOU.

DISABILITY VOICES UNITED HAS

05:20:51.532 --> 05:20:52.933
REVIEWED POS DATA FROM THE LAST

05:20:53.000 --> 05:20:53.534
TWO YEARS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

05:20:53.601 --> 05:20:54.168
THE GRANTS TO REGIONAL CENTERS

05:20:54.234 --> 05:20:54.602
AND COMMUNITY BASED

05:20:54.668 --> 05:20:55.669
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE REDUCE

05:20:55.736 --> 05:20:57.671
DISPARITIES.

05:20:57.738 --> 05:20:58.772
WE HAVE A SHOULD REPORT TO A

05:20:58.839 --> 05:21:00.774
REALITY CHECK HERE.

05:21:00.841 --> 05:21:02.076
THAT ACTUALLY.

05:21:02.142 --> 05:21:03.444
SHOWS THAT.

05:21:03.510 --> 05:21:05.379
DISPARITIES HAVE NOT DECREASED

05:21:05.446 --> 05:21:10.417
BUT ACTUALLY INCREASED -- AND BY

05:21:10.484 --> 05:21:12.419
FAR WITHIN THAT THE THE INCREASE

05:21:12.486 --> 05:21:13.954
LATINOS CONTINUE TO FACE THE

05:21:14.021 --> 05:21:16.190
GREATEST LEVEL OF DISPARITIES AS

05:21:16.256 --> 05:21:18.158
THE LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP SERVED

05:21:18.225 --> 05:21:19.460
BY THE SYSTEM.

05:21:19.526 --> 05:21:21.161
AND THREE YEARS INTO DISPARITY

05:21:21.228 --> 05:21:23.597
EFFORTS MY COMMUNITY.

05:21:23.664 --> 05:21:25.366
CONTINUES TO RECEIVE THE LOS

05:21:25.432 --> 05:21:26.734
AMOUNTS OF SERVICES.

05:21:26.800 --> 05:21:27.801
THE DATA SHOWS THAT IN EVERY

05:21:27.868 --> 05:21:28.636
SINGLE REGIONAL CENTER LATINOS

05:21:28.702 --> 05:21:30.604
GET ABOUT HALF TE AMOUNT OF

05:21:30.671 --> 05:21:32.573
SERVICES COMPARED TO WHITES.

05:21:32.640 --> 05:21:34.008
AT FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS LATINOS

05:21:34.074 --> 05:21:35.776
RECEIVE ONLY A THIRD OR ACTUALLY

05:21:35.843 --> 05:21:36.810
LESS.

05:21:36.877 --> 05:21:39.013
OF WHAT WHITES RECEIVE AND

05:21:39.079 --> 05:21:40.414
THINGS SEEM TO BE WORSE.

05:21:40.481 --> 05:21:41.782
REGIONAL CENTERS WITH THE

05:21:41.849 --> 05:21:43.851
LARGEST POPULATION OF LATINOS

05:21:43.917 --> 05:21:45.452
FOR EXAMPLE ONCE AGAIN

05:21:45.519 --> 05:21:46.654
CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER.

05:21:46.720 --> 05:21:49.523
WHO HAS A ABOUT A 68% LATINO

05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:51.792
POPULATION OR OF CONSUMERS

05:21:51.859 --> 05:21:54.662
RECEIVES ABOUT 18% OF WHAT

05:21:54.728 --> 05:21:56.296
WHITES RECEIVING SERVICES?

05:21:56.363 --> 05:21:57.965
SO WE RICH APPRECIATE AND TO

05:21:58.032 --> 05:22:01.835
RESPECT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

05:22:01.902 --> 05:22:04.171
LEGISLATOR. FOR ALL THE EFFORTS

05:22:04.238 --> 05:22:04.505
OF THE MADE.

05:22:04.571 --> 05:22:05.839
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT REGIONAL

05:22:05.906 --> 05:22:07.307
CENTERS TO A LOT OF THINGS VERY

05:22:07.374 --> 05:22:09.343
WELL -- TODAY AND OUR FOCUS HAS

05:22:09.410 --> 05:22:11.679
BEEN IN THIS ONE AREA WITHIN

05:22:11.745 --> 05:22:12.379
DISPARITIES [inaudible]

05:22:12.446 --> 05:22:16.617
WE ASK WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE

05:22:16.684 --> 05:22:17.284
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN BE

05:22:17.351 --> 05:22:18.719
DONE THE FIRST WE BELIEVE THAT

05:22:18.786 --> 05:22:20.654
MANY REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE NOT

05:22:20.721 --> 05:22:22.322
MEANINGFULLY INCLUDED.

05:22:22.389 --> 05:22:24.525
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY

05:22:24.591 --> 05:22:25.659
DISPARITIES IN THEIR PLANNING.

05:22:25.726 --> 05:22:27.327
SO PEOPLE WHO FACE DISPARITIES

05:22:27.394 --> 05:22:28.696
ARE ACTUALLY THE BEST EXPERTS AT

05:22:28.762 --> 05:22:30.397
WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THAT CAN

05:22:30.464 --> 05:22:31.432
BE HELPED.

05:22:31.498 --> 05:22:32.966
SECOND THE FUNDS THAT WERE

05:22:33.033 --> 05:22:34.034
ALLOCATED.

05:22:34.101 --> 05:22:35.102
BASED ON THE LEVEL OF DISPARITY

05:22:35.169 --> 05:22:36.937
IN A PARTICULAR AREA OR HOW THEY

05:22:37.004 --> 05:22:39.406
WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE DISPARITIES

05:22:39.473 --> 05:22:41.241
IS GOING TO BE A KEY ISSUE.

05:22:41.308 --> 05:22:42.543
AND THIRD THERE REALLY IS NO

05:22:42.609 --> 05:22:45.145
INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF THE

05:22:45.212 --> 05:22:46.547
FUNDED PROGRAMS TO SEE THEIR

05:22:46.613 --> 05:22:47.715
IMPACT.

05:22:47.781 --> 05:22:49.683
FINALLY IT IS TIME THAT WE ARE

05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:51.852
HONEST ABOUT THE FACT THAT MANY

05:22:51.919 --> 05:22:54.888
IN MY COMMUNITY REPORT FEELING

05:22:54.955 --> 05:22:56.023
INTIMIDATED BY THE SYSTEM.

05:22:56.090 --> 05:22:57.658
THAT ARE SOMETIMES AFRAID TO

05:22:57.725 --> 05:23:00.994
SPEAK UP IN FEAR RETALIATION

05:23:01.061 --> 05:23:02.429
AGAINST THEM IN THEIR CHILD.

05:23:02.496 --> 05:23:03.564
SO WE NEED TO REALLY STOP

05:23:03.630 --> 05:23:05.365
DENYING THE FACT THAT.

05:23:05.432 --> 05:23:06.900
THE REAL BY A SUCCESS AND WE

05:23:06.967 --> 05:23:08.068
NEED TO STOP CONTRIBUTING

05:23:08.135 --> 05:23:10.170
DISPARITIES TO ACTUALLY ETHNIC

05:23:10.237 --> 05:23:11.638
CULTURES OF FAMILIES.

05:23:11.705 --> 05:23:13.507
WE NEED TO REALLY STOP MAKING

05:23:13.574 --> 05:23:14.908
EXCUSES THAT'S WHY DISABILITY

05:23:14.975 --> 05:23:16.910
VOICES UNITED THIS REQUEST IN

05:23:16.977 --> 05:23:18.445
THAT A SMALL PORTION.

05:23:18.512 --> 05:23:20.114
OF NEXT YEAR'S ELEVEN MILLION

05:23:20.180 --> 05:23:21.348
DOLLAR BUDGET GO TO AN

05:23:21.415 --> 05:23:23.150
INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF THE

05:23:23.217 --> 05:23:25.018
PROCESS THAT'S USED TO DETERMINE

05:23:25.085 --> 05:23:26.253
GRANTS AND WHETHER THE FUNDED

05:23:26.320 --> 05:23:27.387
PROJECTS.

05:23:27.454 --> 05:23:29.456
ACTUALLY REDUCE DISPARITIES.

05:23:29.523 --> 05:23:31.191
THE RESULTS OF THE INDEPENDENT

05:23:31.258 --> 05:23:32.526
EVALUATIONS CAN BE SHARED.

05:23:32.593 --> 05:23:34.328
SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO

05:23:34.394 --> 05:23:35.562
CREATE A TRANSPARENT AND

05:23:35.629 --> 05:23:37.865
COLLABORATIVE PATH TOWARD AND

05:23:37.931 --> 05:23:39.867
EQUITABLE SYSTEM.

05:23:39.933 --> 05:23:42.336
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

05:23:42.402 --> 05:23:43.403
PARDEE MODEM OF FAMILY MEMBERS

05:23:43.470 --> 05:23:43.971
CALIFORNIA DISPLACING YOUR

05:23:44.037 --> 05:23:45.339
COMMITTEE ACTION NETWORK ALSO A

05:23:45.405 --> 05:23:47.908
MEMBER OF THE DDS DIRECTORS

05:23:47.975 --> 05:23:49.843
DISPARITIES ADVISORY.

05:23:49.910 --> 05:23:50.911
COMMITTEE.

05:23:50.978 --> 05:23:52.713
YEAH AND I AGREE -- THAT -- THE

05:23:52.780 --> 05:23:55.849
DDS HAS TAKEN SOME GOOD STEPS --

05:23:55.916 --> 05:23:59.153
TOWARDS REDUCING DISPARITIES BUT

05:23:59.219 --> 05:24:00.320
THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY -- AS

05:24:00.387 --> 05:24:02.656
A FAMILY MEMBER AND AS AN

05:24:02.723 --> 05:24:03.323
ADVOCATE.

05:24:03.390 --> 05:24:04.625
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

05:24:04.691 --> 05:24:05.893
FOR PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

05:24:05.959 --> 05:24:07.861
IMPACT OF DISPARITIES IS NOT

05:24:07.928 --> 05:24:09.463
JUST SOMEONE LOSING A SERVICE

05:24:09.530 --> 05:24:10.864
ARE NOT GETTING A SERVICES

05:24:10.931 --> 05:24:11.965
SOMEONE BEING HARMED.

05:24:12.032 --> 05:24:13.433
ESPECIALLY INFANTS IN NEED OF

05:24:13.500 --> 05:24:18.338
EARLY START EARLY INTERVENTION --

05:24:18.405 --> 05:24:19.173
AND I THINK WHEN SOMEONE IS

05:24:19.239 --> 05:24:20.808
FACING DISCRIMINATION OR

05:24:20.874 --> 05:24:22.709
BARRIERS DUE TO DISCRIMINATION

05:24:22.776 --> 05:24:24.978
DUE TO OF DISPARITIES.

05:24:25.045 --> 05:24:27.014
IT'S HARD TO BE PATIENT AND HARD

05:24:27.080 --> 05:24:28.715
NOT TO FEEL THAT THE SITUATION

05:24:28.782 --> 05:24:30.717
IS ANYTHING BUT URGENT AND THAT

05:24:30.784 --> 05:24:33.053
AND AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE

05:24:33.120 --> 05:24:34.354
SUGGESTIONS.

05:24:34.421 --> 05:24:36.390
YOU KNOW TO THE STATE INTO THE

05:24:36.456 --> 05:24:37.891
LEGISLATURE IS THAT.

05:24:37.958 --> 05:24:39.593
DDS SHOULD REPLICATE BEST

05:24:39.660 --> 05:24:43.564
PRACTICES BY THE GRANTEES -- IN

05:24:43.630 --> 05:24:45.399
LINK THOSE AS A BASIS FOR

05:24:45.465 --> 05:24:47.935
TARGETED FUNDING INCREASES TIED

05:24:48.001 --> 05:24:50.737
TO MEASURING OUTCOMES -- HAVE

05:24:50.804 --> 05:24:53.006
THOSE DISPARITY FUNDING GRANTEES

05:24:53.073 --> 05:24:55.876
TRAIN OTHER PROVIDERS.

05:24:55.943 --> 05:24:57.644
AND COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS SO

05:24:57.711 --> 05:24:59.313
THAT THEY CAN REPLICATE WHAT

05:24:59.379 --> 05:25:01.615
THEY HAVE DONE.

05:25:01.682 --> 05:25:02.883
I'VE TALKED TO SOME THE GRANTEES

05:25:02.950 --> 05:25:05.285
AND DDS TO CONDUCT MONTHLY OR BI

05:25:05.352 --> 05:25:07.487
MONTHLY CALLS SO THAT THE

05:25:07.554 --> 05:25:09.456
GRANTEES AND THE STATE CAN

05:25:09.523 --> 05:25:11.825
EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON HOW

05:25:11.892 --> 05:25:13.060
THEIR GRANTS ARE GOING IN ANY

05:25:13.126 --> 05:25:14.928
PROBLEMS -- ENCOUNTERING TO

05:25:14.995 --> 05:25:16.396
INCREASE TRANSPARENCY.

05:25:16.463 --> 05:25:18.966
LASTLY -- THE ISSUE OF

05:25:19.032 --> 05:25:21.201
DISPARITIES CROSSES SYSTEM LINES

05:25:21.268 --> 05:25:22.436
AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

05:25:22.502 --> 05:25:23.503
RECOGNIZE THAT COULD WE DON'T

05:25:23.570 --> 05:25:24.771
RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA

05:25:24.838 --> 05:25:26.106
BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IS

05:25:26.173 --> 05:25:27.975
PROBLEMS IT JUST BURIES A MEDI

05:25:28.041 --> 05:25:29.943
CAL I JUST SAYS SPECIAL ED.

05:25:30.010 --> 05:25:31.245
HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

05:25:31.311 --> 05:25:33.280
IDENTITY HEARING WHERE IT WAS

05:25:33.347 --> 05:25:34.882
THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT OF

05:25:34.948 --> 05:25:36.183
TWO MILLION CHILDREN.

05:25:36.250 --> 05:25:37.517
ON MEDI CAL WHO WERE NOT

05:25:37.584 --> 05:25:39.486
RECEIVING A PREVENTIVE HEALTH

05:25:39.553 --> 05:25:41.788
CARE SERVICES AND THE ISSUE IN

05:25:41.855 --> 05:25:43.090
PART WAS DUE TO DISPARITIES.

05:25:43.156 --> 05:25:44.524
AND I THINK ONE THING IS THAT

05:25:44.591 --> 05:25:46.526
CAN HELP ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM IS

05:25:46.593 --> 05:25:47.761
THAT.

05:25:47.828 --> 05:25:49.229
DID ISSUED DISPARITIES IS NOT.

05:25:49.296 --> 05:25:50.497
JUST IN THE REGIONAL CENTER

05:25:50.564 --> 05:25:52.933
SYSTEM IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

05:25:53.000 --> 05:25:53.767
LEASE WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN

05:25:53.834 --> 05:25:55.736
SERVICES ONE SUGGESTION IS THAT

05:25:55.802 --> 05:25:57.070
THE AGENCY BRING TOGETHER ALL

05:25:57.137 --> 05:25:58.005

STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT HOW

05:26:01.141 --> 05:26:02.409
TOGETHER WE CAN. TO RESOLVE

05:26:02.476 --> 05:26:03.810
DISPARITIES OR REDUCE

05:26:03.877 --> 05:26:05.579

ABOUT HOPE PERSON CARE AND SO

05:26:14.888 --> 05:26:15.689

05:26:15.756 --> 05:26:17.858
DISPARITIES SB TAKEN IN THAT

05:26:17.925 --> 05:26:18.158
SAME MANNER.

05:26:25.365 --> 05:26:27.701
OF MONEY.

05:26:27.768 --> 05:26:31.204
AND THINGS ARE WORSE

05:26:31.271 --> 05:26:31.505
[inaudible]

05:26:31.571 --> 05:26:32.606
SO.

05:26:32.673 --> 05:26:35.208
WATCH WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT

05:26:35.275 --> 05:26:38.078

THE INFORMATION THAT INFORMED

05:26:44.952 --> 05:26:45.919
THEIR REVIEW.

05:26:45.986 --> 05:26:47.621
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

05:26:47.688 --> 05:26:49.589
WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BE ABLE

05:26:49.656 --> 05:26:51.825
TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE

05:26:51.892 --> 05:26:52.459
INFORMATION.

05:26:52.526 --> 05:26:55.295

THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

05:26:57.764 --> 05:26:58.832
TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS THE

05:26:58.899 --> 05:27:01.368
MEASURES THAT I WAS -- SPEAKING

05:27:01.435 --> 05:27:03.236
TO I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE AS TO

05:27:03.303 --> 05:27:05.806
THE TIMING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

05:27:05.872 --> 05:27:07.874
OF THE GRANT SO THE FINDINGS

05:27:07.941 --> 05:27:10.677
WERE AVAILABLE IN.

05:27:10.744 --> 05:27:11.278
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN RIGHT --

05:27:11.345 --> 05:27:13.246

HAVING THE FIRST PROJECTS START.

05:27:16.850 --> 05:27:17.751
REALLY HAS ONLY BEEN IN THE LAST

05:27:17.818 --> 05:27:20.287
COUPLE OF YEARS AND SOWHENYOU

05:27:20.354 --> 05:27:22.522

05:27:22.589 --> 05:27:23.090
DOING PROGRAMS FOR TWO YEARS

05:27:23.156 --> 05:27:25.092
DAVE NOT RIGHT SO WE JUST HAD

05:27:25.158 --> 05:27:28.028
OUR OUR FIRST -- PROJECTS FROM

05:27:28.095 --> 05:27:29.930
THAT WERE APPROVED I'M JUST

SUBMITTED THEIR FINAL REPORTS TO

05:27:31.665 --> 05:27:33.233
US IN DECEMBER.

05:27:33.300 --> 05:27:35.168
SO WE REALLY ARE IN THE VERY

05:27:35.235 --> 05:27:36.737
EARLY STAGES.

05:27:36.803 --> 05:27:38.572
OF LOOKING AT THE DATA AND

05:27:38.638 --> 05:27:40.707
LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION.

05:27:40.774 --> 05:27:42.175
ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE OVER I

05:27:42.242 --> 05:27:43.343
MEAN THERE'S PROJECT ON FRIDAY

05:27:43.410 --> 05:27:44.945
AND WHILE OVERALL CORRECT

05:27:45.012 --> 05:27:47.447
CORRECT BUT THE OPPORTUNITY SO

05:27:47.514 --> 05:27:49.316
ALL I'M I JUST WANT TO KIND OF

05:27:49.383 --> 05:27:50.417
POINT OUT IS THAT.

05:27:50.484 --> 05:27:52.753
A POINT OF INFORMATION IS THAT

05:27:52.819 --> 05:27:54.321
WE HAVE THE PROJECTS THAT JUST

05:27:54.388 --> 05:27:57.224
RECENTLY STARTED SO THE IMPACTS

05:27:57.290 --> 05:27:58.725
TO A BROADER SYSTEM.

05:27:58.792 --> 05:28:00.460
YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE WE STILL

05:28:00.527 --> 05:28:02.963
HAVE TO DO SOME KIND OF DIGGING

05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:04.731
INTO THE DATA TO SEE WHAT THOSE

05:28:04.798 --> 05:28:05.766
IMPACTS ARE.

05:28:05.832 --> 05:28:07.367
THE OTHER POINT THAT I'D LIKE TO

05:28:07.434 --> 05:28:09.202
JUST MAKE AND I DON'T KNOW IF

05:28:09.269 --> 05:28:10.670
IT'S INFLUENCE ENOUGH BUT IT'S

05:28:10.737 --> 05:28:12.172
TAKING TIME TO REALLY.

05:28:12.239 --> 05:28:14.107
KIND OF GET INTO THE INFORMATION

05:28:14.174 --> 05:28:15.876
AND DOING OUR ANALYSIS IS

05:28:15.942 --> 05:28:16.977
THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT A

05:28:17.044 --> 05:28:18.478
DIFFERENT POLICY.

05:28:18.545 --> 05:28:19.913
THAT HAS ALSO CHANGED SOME OF

05:28:19.980 --> 05:28:22.516
THE THE EFFORTS AT OR THE

05:28:22.582 --> 05:28:23.683
EXPENDITURES WITHIN OUR PURCHASE

05:28:23.750 --> 05:28:26.086
A SERVICE DATA I DON'T KNOW WHAT

05:28:26.153 --> 05:28:27.587
INFLUENCE THAT HAS ON IT.

05:28:27.654 --> 05:28:30.223
SO IT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

05:28:30.290 --> 05:28:31.658
REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT OUR

05:28:31.725 --> 05:28:33.827
EXPENDITURES TO TAKE A LOOK AT

05:28:33.894 --> 05:28:35.495
THE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT ONLY

05:28:35.562 --> 05:28:36.196
REGIONAL.

05:28:36.263 --> 05:28:37.564
WITHIN EACH REGIONAL CENTER BUT

05:28:37.631 --> 05:28:38.865
STATEWIDE.

05:28:38.932 --> 05:28:41.435
SO NOT SAYING THAT THESE ARE NOT

05:28:41.501 --> 05:28:42.669
IMPORTANT ISSUES BECAUSE I

05:28:42.736 --> 05:28:47.674
CERTAINLY AM.

05:28:47.741 --> 05:28:48.775
BUT I AM SAYING THAT WE DON'T

05:28:48.842 --> 05:28:49.876
HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO

05:28:49.943 --> 05:28:51.011
RESPOND TO SAY WHETHER.

05:28:51.078 --> 05:28:52.546
WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND THE

05:28:52.612 --> 05:28:53.780
TOTALITY THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE

05:28:53.847 --> 05:28:56.883
TO REPORT -- WHETHER THERE IS

05:28:56.950 --> 05:28:59.286
PROGRESS OR NO PROGRESS

05:28:59.352 --> 05:28:59.586
[inaudible]

05:28:59.653 --> 05:29:04.191
OKAY SO.

05:29:04.257 --> 05:29:06.259
SIDE DEBT.

05:29:06.326 --> 05:29:07.627
SO THE THING IS I FOOD BECAUSE

05:29:07.694 --> 05:29:12.199
THIS WAY -- I THINK YOU KNOW

05:29:12.265 --> 05:29:15.569
THIS IS URGENT. EIGHT BECAUSE

05:29:15.635 --> 05:29:17.471
DISPARITIES ARE QUITE SEVERE AND

05:29:17.537 --> 05:29:19.506
THE LEAST.

05:29:19.573 --> 05:29:22.109
THE HEARING MAY BE WORSE RIGHT I

05:29:22.175 --> 05:29:23.443
AM NOT HEARING A LOT OF LIKE --

05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:25.479
GOT A LOT BETTER I MEAN MAYBE

05:29:25.545 --> 05:29:27.714
MAYBE DETAILS WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH

05:29:27.781 --> 05:29:31.751
MARGINAL CHANGE OR IS -- BUT

05:29:31.818 --> 05:29:33.320
THANK YOU KNOW AND EVERY AND

05:29:33.386 --> 05:29:34.321
EVERY.

05:29:34.387 --> 05:29:36.123
YEAR THAT GOES BY THAT'S ANOTHER

05:29:36.189 --> 05:29:37.190
GROUP.

05:29:37.257 --> 05:29:39.192
RIGHT I MEAN AND SO I CAN GO

05:29:39.259 --> 05:29:40.994
WINE BACK TIME AND SIX IT FOR

05:29:41.061 --> 05:29:41.895
THEM.

05:29:41.962 --> 05:29:42.762
SO I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

05:29:42.829 --> 05:29:44.731
URGENCY I THINK THAT WAS

05:29:44.798 --> 05:29:46.633
EXPRESSED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE

05:29:46.700 --> 05:29:48.068
FIRST ALLOCATED THE MONEY.

05:29:48.135 --> 05:29:50.737
THAT THIS IS PROBLEMATIC --

05:29:50.804 --> 05:29:52.539
PEOPLE ASK ME SO HOW'S THINGS

05:29:52.606 --> 05:29:54.074
GOING AND I'M GOING WELL I GUESS

05:29:54.141 --> 05:29:56.376
WE'LL FIND OUT SO AND RIGHT NOW

05:29:56.443 --> 05:29:58.011
I'M NOT GONNA BILL SURE ANY GOOD

05:29:58.078 --> 05:30:00.547
NEWS WITH THEM YET -- AND DAIRY

05:30:00.614 --> 05:30:01.882
EXPECT TO HAVE THEY WANT TO SEE

05:30:01.948 --> 05:30:06.219
MAJOR CHANGES AND AND THAT.

05:30:06.286 --> 05:30:07.721
AND EIGHT YOU KNOW APPRECIATE

05:30:07.787 --> 05:30:08.822
PEOPLE OF THESE LITTLE PROJECTS

05:30:08.889 --> 05:30:10.590
HERE BUT I'M WE'RE TALKING MAJOR

05:30:10.657 --> 05:30:14.060
CULTURAL CHANGE.

05:30:14.127 --> 05:30:16.530
THE OTHER THING THAT I'M HEARING.

05:30:16.596 --> 05:30:18.965
AS VERY DISTURBED -- FROM MISTER

05:30:19.032 --> 05:30:19.833
GOMEZ IS IS THAT PEOPLE FEEL

05:30:19.900 --> 05:30:23.403
INTIMIDATED -- EITHER WAY I'M

05:30:23.470 --> 05:30:24.804
ALSO SIT ON THE COMMITTEE HUMAN

05:30:24.871 --> 05:30:26.039
SERVICES WE JUST HAD A BILL

05:30:26.106 --> 05:30:27.541
SOMEONE ACTUALLY SUBMITTED

05:30:27.607 --> 05:30:28.241
BECAUSE THEY SAID DOES

05:30:28.308 --> 05:30:29.609
INTIMIDATION GOING ON AT THE

05:30:29.676 --> 05:30:31.811
CENTERS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

05:30:31.878 --> 05:30:34.147
GOING ON THERE WHY WHY WHY IS

05:30:34.214 --> 05:30:34.681
EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT TO

05:30:34.748 --> 05:30:36.950
MEDIATION.

05:30:37.017 --> 05:30:38.818
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE AS FAR AS

05:30:38.885 --> 05:30:42.255
THE ON THE INTIMIDATION NOW WE

05:30:42.322 --> 05:30:44.090
HAVE YOU KNOW AND AND MISTER

05:30:44.157 --> 05:30:46.159
GOMEZ AND OTHERS HAVE SHARED

05:30:46.226 --> 05:30:48.295
THOSE CONCERNS.

05:30:48.361 --> 05:30:49.529
AND IS.

05:30:49.596 --> 05:30:51.231
LOOKING AT THE WORK THAT WE'VE

05:30:51.298 --> 05:30:53.066
BEEN DOING WHAT THE REGIONAL

05:30:53.133 --> 05:30:54.534
CENTERS AND ANY TIME.

05:30:54.601 --> 05:30:56.169
CERTAINLY THAT WE'VE HEARD THE

05:30:56.236 --> 05:30:57.904
CONCERNS WE REACT TO IT BUT

05:30:57.971 --> 05:30:59.573
THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER WE GOT A

05:30:59.639 --> 05:31:01.675
CHANGE THE CULTURE AS FAR AS THE

05:31:01.741 --> 05:31:04.077
RELATIONSHIP AND MAKING SURE

05:31:04.144 --> 05:31:06.213
THAT THERE IS A SAFE PLACE. FOR

05:31:06.279 --> 05:31:08.248
FOR FAMILIES TO GO AND MAKE SURE

05:31:08.315 --> 05:31:09.683
THAT THEY HAVE THOSE RESOURCES

05:31:09.749 --> 05:31:10.617
SO WHEN.

05:31:10.684 --> 05:31:12.419
WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE PROPOSAL'S

05:31:12.485 --> 05:31:13.853
IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE THE PROPOSALS

05:31:13.920 --> 05:31:15.755
ARE THE ACTIONS THAT ARE GOING

05:31:15.822 --> 05:31:18.625
TO BE ABLE TO BE TAKEN? TO HELP.

05:31:18.692 --> 05:31:19.793
YOU KNOW ADDRESS THAT

05:31:19.859 --> 05:31:21.394
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BECAUSE

05:31:21.461 --> 05:31:23.597
INTIMIDATION IS NOT OKAY NO IT'S

05:31:23.663 --> 05:31:25.532
NOT -- TAKING A LOOK AT SO FOR

05:31:25.599 --> 05:31:28.134
EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW USING THE

05:31:28.201 --> 05:31:29.736
PERMIT TORAH MODEL HAS BEEN A

05:31:29.803 --> 05:31:32.572
VERY VERY GOOD PROJECT THAT HAS

05:31:32.639 --> 05:31:35.008
BEEN REPLICATED OVER DIFFERENT.

05:31:35.075 --> 05:31:36.876
ON REGIONAL CENTERS CATCHMENT

05:31:36.943 --> 05:31:38.712
AREAS AND THEY BEEN MODELS THAT

05:31:38.778 --> 05:31:39.646
HAVE BEEN DONE BASED ON

05:31:39.713 --> 05:31:41.881
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:43.783
SO HERE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE

05:31:43.850 --> 05:31:45.619
TRUST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT

05:31:45.685 --> 05:31:47.754
IS SO CRITICAL. TO REALLY START

05:31:47.821 --> 05:31:49.356
CHANGING KIND OF THAT CULTURE

05:31:49.422 --> 05:31:51.291
AND HELPING MAKE SURE THAT

05:31:51.358 --> 05:31:53.126
THERE'S THAT VOICE NOW WHEN WE

05:31:53.193 --> 05:31:55.762
DO SO WE HAVE TO DO IT TOO I SEE

05:31:55.829 --> 05:31:56.630
TWO PATHS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

05:31:56.696 --> 05:31:57.998
WITH IT WHAT IS THAT

05:31:58.064 --> 05:31:59.432
PREVENTATIVE PATH TO MAKE SURE

05:31:59.499 --> 05:32:01.001
THAT WE'RE CHANGING THAT CULTURE.

05:32:01.067 --> 05:32:02.302
AND THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT

05:32:02.369 --> 05:32:04.704
IF WE DO AS AN APARTMENT HERE

05:32:04.771 --> 05:32:06.039
THAT THERE IS LEVELS OF

05:32:06.106 --> 05:32:07.907
INTIMIDATION THAT WE STARTED

05:32:07.974 --> 05:32:10.010
DRESSING THOSE ISSUES AND MAKE

05:32:10.076 --> 05:32:11.244
AND HOLDING REGIONAL CENTERS

05:32:11.311 --> 05:32:14.781
ACCOUNTABLE. TO TO FIX KIND OF

05:32:14.848 --> 05:32:16.416
THEIR CULTURE YOU THERE'S A

05:32:16.483 --> 05:32:17.684
REASON WHY IF THERE IS SOMETHING

05:32:17.751 --> 05:32:19.986
THAT'S GOING ON WE NEED TO HAVE

05:32:20.053 --> 05:32:22.555
A A PLAN. TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:32:22.622 --> 05:32:24.291
THERE IS A SAFE PLACE TO HAVE

05:32:24.357 --> 05:32:26.293
SERVICES WE RECOGNIZE THAT

05:32:26.359 --> 05:32:28.228
THERE'S CHANGES THAT HAVE

05:32:28.295 --> 05:32:30.964
HAPPENED AS FAR AS IMMIGRATION

05:32:31.031 --> 05:32:31.831
AND EVERYTHING BUT THE

05:32:31.898 --> 05:32:32.899
HEIGHTENED.

05:32:32.966 --> 05:32:39.205
KIND OF THE THE FEAR OF PURE

05:32:39.272 --> 05:32:42.409
KIND OF FIGHT A BUREAUCRACY OR

05:32:42.475 --> 05:32:43.143
AN ORGANIZATION.

05:32:43.209 --> 05:32:44.177
IN GOVERNMENT AND SO REGIONAL

NOT SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT

05:33:04.798 --> 05:33:06.499
CONCERNED AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING

05:33:06.566 --> 05:33:08.034
THAT IS SO CRITICAL TO PAY

05:33:08.101 --> 05:33:09.402
ATTENTION.

05:33:09.469 --> 05:33:11.004

IN SOME OTHER AREAS.

05:33:25.985 --> 05:33:28.321
SO WE DO HAVE SOME PROJECT BASED

THAT WE ARE SEEING SOME EVIDENCE

05:33:30.657 --> 05:33:32.559
OF REALLY GOOD PRACTICES THAT

ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

05:33:34.294 --> 05:33:35.562

SAYING OKAY HOW DO WE TAKE A

05:33:37.230 --> 05:33:39.733

SEEN ON OUR MEASURES THAT WAS

05:34:35.255 --> 05:34:36.589
THE POINT IN TIME THAT WE'RE

05:34:36.656 --> 05:34:40.093
USING TO MEASURE. TO FIFTEEN

05:34:40.160 --> 05:34:40.894

RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE USING

05:34:45.198 --> 05:34:47.267
PURCHASED A SERVICE DATA THAT

05:34:47.333 --> 05:34:50.603
ENDS DECEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN

EARLY PART OF NEXT YEAR.

05:35:00.880 --> 05:35:02.949
AND THAT IS THAT COMPREHENSIVE

05:35:03.016 --> 05:35:04.284
MEASURE REPORTERS THAT'S THE

05:35:04.350 --> 05:35:06.419
OVERALL ACROSS THE SYSTEM

CORRECT ON THE MEASURES THAT ARE

05:35:07.620 --> 05:35:09.722
ACTUALLY LISTED IN YOUR AGENDA.

05:35:09.789 --> 05:35:12.058
AND THEN YOU ALSO ARE LOOKING AT

05:35:12.125 --> 05:35:13.226
THE INDIVIDUAL PRIDE I MEAN

05:35:13.293 --> 05:35:14.928
YOU'VE BEEN FUNDING THEM FOR

05:35:14.994 --> 05:35:16.229
SEVERAL YEARS NOW.

05:35:16.296 --> 05:35:17.497
LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL

05:35:17.564 --> 05:35:19.332
PROJECTS AND THEN THOUGH AS I

05:35:19.399 --> 05:35:20.467
WAS SAYING THE FIRST YEAR

05:35:20.533 --> 05:35:23.102
PROJECTS WE JUST RECEIVED THEIR

05:35:23.169 --> 05:35:24.571
FINAL REPORT.

05:35:24.637 --> 05:35:26.840
AT THE END OF DECEMBER AND SO

05:35:26.906 --> 05:35:28.174
WE'RE JUST IN THAT THERE WERE

05:35:28.241 --> 05:35:31.110
FINALIZING KIND OF THOSE.

05:35:31.177 --> 05:35:33.580
THAT -- OKAY SO OUTCOMES AT THIS

05:35:33.646 --> 05:35:37.750
TIME OKAY SO WHAT AT WHAT POINT.

05:35:37.817 --> 05:35:39.452
THEN DE USE THAT [inaudible]

05:35:39.519 --> 05:35:41.821
THIS. TWELVE CAN NOW THAT YOU

05:35:41.888 --> 05:35:42.455
HAVE THE INFORMATION FROM THESE

05:35:42.522 --> 05:35:43.490
PILOTS.

05:35:43.556 --> 05:35:44.924
WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY OKAY WELL

05:35:44.991 --> 05:35:46.426
WE CAN TAKE THE BEST OF THAT AND

05:35:46.493 --> 05:35:46.893
EVERYONE HAS TO DO IT

05:35:46.960 --> 05:35:47.193
[inaudible]

05:35:47.260 --> 05:35:49.095
WELL.

05:35:49.162 --> 05:35:51.130
WE ARE WERE REVIEWING THOSE WERE

05:35:51.197 --> 05:35:53.800
NOT WAITING FOR JUST OKAY.

05:35:53.867 --> 05:35:55.468
TO A MOM AS FAR AS EVERYBODY HAS

05:35:55.535 --> 05:35:56.836
TO DO IT I THINK THAT THOSE

05:35:56.903 --> 05:35:58.304
THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS

05:35:58.371 --> 05:35:59.439
THAT WERE LOOKING OUT AS FAR AS

05:35:59.506 --> 05:36:00.773
THOSE BEST PRACTICES.

05:36:00.840 --> 05:36:02.408
BUT WE'RE ALSO STILL USING THE

05:36:02.475 --> 05:36:04.511
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY YOU KNOW IF

05:36:04.577 --> 05:36:06.246
THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES OR

05:36:06.312 --> 05:36:07.647
REPLICATING WE DON'T WANT TO

05:36:07.714 --> 05:36:08.515
WAIT.

05:36:08.581 --> 05:36:09.916
SO WE ARE SEEING THAT WE ARE

05:36:09.983 --> 05:36:11.451
DOING SOME REPLICATION OF

05:36:11.518 --> 05:36:13.152
PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOWING

05:36:13.219 --> 05:36:16.256
EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS AND SO FOR

05:36:16.322 --> 05:36:17.824
EXAMPLE I MEAN WE HAVE.

05:36:17.891 --> 05:36:18.458
ALL RIGHT I'D I'D HAVE TO GET

05:36:18.525 --> 05:36:20.093
YOU THE NUMBER BUT THE NUMBER OF

05:36:20.159 --> 05:36:21.060
FROM A TORAH MODELS OR

05:36:21.127 --> 05:36:23.930
NAVIGATORS OR TAKING A LOOK AT

05:36:23.997 --> 05:36:26.099
EXPANDING KIND OF THE THAT THE

05:36:26.165 --> 05:36:27.800
THAT OUT REACH THAT FAMILIES

05:36:27.867 --> 05:36:29.168
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO FROM THAT

05:36:29.235 --> 05:36:31.504
ORGANIC KIND OF GRASS ROOTS.

05:36:31.571 --> 05:36:33.206
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REPLICATE

05:36:33.273 --> 05:36:34.841
THAT SO WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT.

05:36:34.908 --> 05:36:36.376
SO WE DO WANT TO DO SOMETHING

05:36:36.442 --> 05:36:38.211
THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

05:36:38.278 --> 05:36:39.812
DOING PROGRESS ON ANNUAL BASIS

05:36:39.879 --> 05:36:41.514
AS OPPOSED TO WAIT ON IT AND AND

05:36:41.581 --> 05:36:43.082
AND AND NOT SAYING WAIT BUT A

05:36:43.149 --> 05:36:44.117
WHAT POINT DOES IT ACTUALLY

05:36:44.183 --> 05:36:45.518
REACH SCALE.

05:36:45.585 --> 05:36:49.522
UNDERSTOOD RIGHT NOW I MEAN.

05:36:49.589 --> 05:36:50.456
WHAT POINT IS A READ SCALE

05:36:50.523 --> 05:36:52.759
BECAUSE AGAIN IT COMES DOWN?

05:36:52.825 --> 05:36:55.094
TO WHEN DO WE SEE A MAJOR CHANGE

05:36:55.161 --> 05:36:57.030
IN THOSE NUMBERS RIGHT SO

05:36:57.096 --> 05:36:58.498
BECAUSE IF EVERYONE EVERYTHING

05:36:58.565 --> 05:37:00.567
STAYS PILOTS.

05:37:00.633 --> 05:37:01.334
WE'RE NOT MOVING THE BIG NUMBER

05:37:01.401 --> 05:37:04.037
SO I MAY MOVE A LITTLE NUMBER

05:37:04.103 --> 05:37:05.104
FOR THE PILOT PHOSPHORYLATION

05:37:05.171 --> 05:37:06.940
BUT THEN WE GOT AND THEN MOVES

05:37:07.006 --> 05:37:08.641
TO CHANGING THE NUMBER.

05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:10.476
SO THAT MEANS TAKING THE MOST

05:37:10.543 --> 05:37:12.078
EFFECTIVE THINGS AND BRING IT TO

05:37:12.145 --> 05:37:13.846
SCALE RIGHT THAT MEANS WELL

05:37:13.913 --> 05:37:15.381
ALMOST EVERYBODY DOES IT MAYBE

05:37:15.448 --> 05:37:16.249
THERE'S SOME PLACES WHERE IT

05:37:16.316 --> 05:37:17.750
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT

05:37:17.817 --> 05:37:20.720
ESSENTIALLY USE STAR ROLE AND

05:37:20.787 --> 05:37:21.754
MORE THAT CELL.

05:37:21.821 --> 05:37:23.990
AND AND I THINK WHAT.

05:37:24.057 --> 05:37:25.992
WE HEAR AN EIGHT AND WHAT I HEAR

05:37:26.059 --> 05:37:28.127
FROM MY COLLEAGUES IS THAT NOW

05:37:28.194 --> 05:37:28.661
THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE

05:37:28.728 --> 05:37:29.562
IMPATIENT.

05:37:29.629 --> 05:37:36.669
ABOUT THIS SO -- SO WITH IT.

05:37:36.736 --> 05:37:37.704
SO IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS AND

05:37:37.770 --> 05:37:39.706
UNITE I GOT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT

05:37:39.772 --> 05:37:40.974
THAT SET HER UP BUT HOW MANY

05:37:41.040 --> 05:37:42.375
YEARS DO WE HAVE TO WAIT.

05:37:42.442 --> 05:37:46.179
RIGHT AND SO WHEN WHEN YOU KNOW

05:37:46.245 --> 05:37:48.348
HOW.

05:37:48.414 --> 05:37:49.349
THIS WORKS [inaudible]

05:37:49.415 --> 05:37:51.851
THE THANK YOU TO REGIONAL CENTER

05:37:51.918 --> 05:37:52.652
SHOULD BE IN OVERDRIVE TRYING TO

05:37:52.719 --> 05:37:55.755
FIX THIS PROBLEM.

05:37:55.822 --> 05:37:58.391
RIGHT I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT NOT

05:37:58.458 --> 05:37:59.392
LIKE WHAT HAVE I GOT SOME LABEL

05:37:59.459 --> 05:37:59.993
DEAL TILE ON THE SIDE IF THEY

05:38:00.059 --> 05:38:01.594
SHOULD BE LOOKING INTERNALLY AND

05:38:01.661 --> 05:38:02.729
RIGHT NW CHANGING THE WAY THEY

05:38:02.795 --> 05:38:04.731
DO THINGS LOOKING AT HEY WHAT'S

05:38:04.797 --> 05:38:06.499
GOING ON AND WE HAVE TO TAKE

05:38:06.566 --> 05:38:07.100
THREE TYPES OF PEOPLE AT THE

05:38:07.166 --> 05:38:09.369
TABLE. TO BE SURE WE CAN ADDRESS

05:38:09.435 --> 05:38:10.336
THE DISPARITIES AT CENTER OF SO

05:38:10.403 --> 05:38:15.008
BEYOND JUST THE FUNDED PILOTS.

05:38:15.074 --> 05:38:15.274
YOU KNOW.

05:38:15.341 --> 05:38:17.010

YOU KNOW MAJOR CHANGES AND AND

05:38:20.413 --> 05:38:21.881
THE DISPARITY NUMBERS THAT'S

05:38:21.948 --> 05:38:23.082
THAT'S THE EXPECTATION.

05:38:23.149 --> 05:38:25.151
AND RIGHT AS FAR AS THOSE

05:38:25.218 --> 05:38:27.987
MEASURES YOU KNOW THE FIGHT.

05:38:28.054 --> 05:38:29.322
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE

05:38:29.389 --> 05:38:30.823
MEASURES AND BE ABLE TO RESPOND

05:38:30.890 --> 05:38:31.824
TO THOSE MEASURES THE CERTAINLY

05:38:31.891 --> 05:38:33.860
IMPORTANT WE DO ABSOLUTELY AND

05:38:33.926 --> 05:38:36.629
AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF HAVING --

05:38:36.696 --> 05:38:38.431
THE ESTABLISHED MEASURE MEASURES

05:38:38.498 --> 05:38:40.233
THAT WE PUT FORWARD -- I ALSO

05:38:40.299 --> 05:38:42.268
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS A

05:38:42.335 --> 05:38:44.137
DEPARTMENT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

05:38:44.203 --> 05:38:45.838
ANY OF THE MAJOR INITIATIVES THE

05:38:45.905 --> 05:38:47.373
FIRST THINGS THAT WE DO IS TO

05:38:47.440 --> 05:38:49.075
SAY HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING THIS

05:38:49.142 --> 05:38:49.776
FROM.

05:38:49.842 --> 05:38:51.744
KIND OF A CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE

05:38:51.811 --> 05:38:52.578
AS WELL.

05:38:52.645 --> 05:38:54.414
SO WHAT WERE SO WE CAN REALLY

05:38:54.480 --> 05:38:56.315
TAKE A LOOK AT MAKING SURE THAT

05:38:56.382 --> 05:38:58.284
AS WERE IMPLEMENTING -- NEW

05:38:58.351 --> 05:39:00.753
EFFORTS THAT WERE NOT CONTINUING

05:39:00.820 --> 05:39:03.623
TO HAVE KIND OF THIS INEQUITY SO

05:39:03.690 --> 05:39:04.590
FOR EXAMPLE WITH SELF

05:39:04.657 --> 05:39:05.591
DETERMINATION.

05:39:05.658 --> 05:39:06.726
YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR

05:39:06.793 --> 05:39:09.028
SELECTION AS FAR AS THE TWENTY

05:39:09.095 --> 05:39:10.196
FIVE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS.

05:39:10.263 --> 05:39:13.466
THE FIRST POINT OF OF THE POLL

05:39:13.533 --> 05:39:15.034
AS FAR AS THE RANDOM SELECTION

05:39:15.101 --> 05:39:16.869
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD TO BE

05:39:16.936 --> 05:39:18.137
BASED ON ETHNICITY AS

05:39:18.204 --> 05:39:19.972
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE KIND OF

05:39:20.039 --> 05:39:21.407
THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:39:21.474 --> 05:39:23.209
WE WERE NOT PERPETUATING KIND OF

05:39:23.276 --> 05:39:23.776
THIS PROBLEM FROM NEW

05:39:23.843 --> 05:39:25.178
INITIATIVES.

05:39:25.244 --> 05:39:29.415

LIKE NOT MINIMIZE KIND OF THE

05:39:30.583 --> 05:39:31.951
THE CONCERNS THAT ARE SHARED BUT

05:39:32.018 --> 05:39:34.120
TO SAY THAT THIS EFFORT THAT HAS

05:39:34.187 --> 05:39:36.222
TO GO FORWARD IS SOMETHING THAT

05:39:36.289 --> 05:39:37.390
WE ARE.

05:39:37.457 --> 05:39:39.225

05:39:39.292 --> 05:39:41.394
WORKING ON KIND OF THAT

05:39:41.461 --> 05:39:42.762
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.

05:39:42.829 --> 05:39:44.263
WITHIN THE PROPOSAL'S BUT TAKING

05:39:44.330 --> 05:39:45.765

IN A MINDFUL WAY.

05:39:52.405 --> 05:39:54.607
SO WE'RE ADDRESSING IT --

05:39:54.674 --> 05:39:56.075
THROUGH THE LENS OF MAKING SURE

05:39:56.142 --> 05:39:58.010
THAT AS OUR SYSTEM IS MAKING

05:39:58.077 --> 05:40:00.179

REGIONAL CENTERS VIEW THE

05:41:09.248 --> 05:41:10.116
OPPORTUNITY TO USE DISPARITY

05:41:10.183 --> 05:41:12.952
GRANTS AS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

05:41:13.019 --> 05:41:15.054

SHOULD BE SERVING.

05:41:59.599 --> 05:42:00.366
THAT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING

05:42:00.433 --> 05:42:02.902
ON ABSOLUTELY AND ONE OF THE

05:42:02.969 --> 05:42:04.403
BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN A SYSTEM

05:42:04.470 --> 05:42:05.738
FINDING THOSE PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT

SERVING AND ONE OF THE THINGS

05:42:08.107 --> 05:42:10.109
THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE DOING --

05:42:10.176 --> 05:42:11.577

WHAT IS IT ABOUT OUR SERVICE

05:42:23.055 --> 05:42:24.724
SYSTEM THAT ISN'T SPEAKING TO

05:45:56.135 --> 05:45:58.504
PEOPLE DO NOT FEEL INTIMIDATED

05:45:58.571 --> 05:45:59.939
OR FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GONNA BE

05:46:00.005 --> 05:46:01.607
RETALIATED THAT SURREAL FEELING

05:46:01.674 --> 05:46:02.875
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY

05:46:02.942 --> 05:46:03.809
HAPPEN.

05:46:03.876 --> 05:46:05.544
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IS NOT

05:46:05.611 --> 05:46:07.146
GOOD PEOPLE WORKING AT THE

05:46:07.213 --> 05:46:07.713
REGIONAL CENTERS AND BECAUSE

05:46:07.780 --> 05:46:08.647
THERE ARE.

05:46:08.714 --> 05:46:10.850
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IS

05:46:10.916 --> 05:46:11.951
CREATE A SITUATION WHERE IT IS

05:46:12.017 --> 05:46:13.285
SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO RAISE

05:46:13.352 --> 05:46:15.087
CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING

05:46:15.154 --> 05:46:16.188
THE SERVICES OR THERE'S A

05:46:16.255 --> 05:46:17.223
PROBLEM BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T

05:46:17.289 --> 05:46:18.591
CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

05:46:18.657 --> 05:46:20.226
THAN ALL THE REPORTING THE WORLD

05:46:20.292 --> 05:46:21.861
IS NOT GOING TO MATTER RIGHT AND

05:46:21.927 --> 05:46:22.461
YOU KNOW JUST FROM YOUR OWN

05:46:22.528 --> 05:46:23.362
PRACTICE.

05:46:23.429 --> 05:46:24.463
AND WE GOT TO CREATE A SAFE

05:46:24.530 --> 05:46:26.298
ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE TO AT

05:46:26.365 --> 05:46:28.000
LEAST RAISE CONCERNS.

05:46:28.067 --> 05:46:29.168
AND THAT AGAIN IS NOT A

05:46:29.235 --> 05:46:30.903
REFLECTION ON THE GOOD PEOPLE

05:46:30.970 --> 05:46:32.138
WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT

05:46:32.204 --> 05:46:33.372
THING AND REGIONAL CENTERS BUT

05:46:33.439 --> 05:46:35.407
IT'S ALSO NOT A REFLECTION.

05:46:35.474 --> 05:46:36.075
OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES

05:46:36.142 --> 05:46:38.477
WHO SIMPLY WANT TO GET HELP FOR

05:46:38.544 --> 05:46:40.246
THEIR FAMILIES AND I THINK IF WE

05:46:40.312 --> 05:46:41.814
WORK IN THAT WAY WE'RE REALLY

05:46:41.881 --> 05:46:44.517
TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER --

05:46:44.583 --> 05:46:45.718
AND THEN LATER ON THE OTHER

05:46:45.784 --> 05:46:47.686
STEPS AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR --

05:46:47.753 --> 05:46:49.255
YOU KNOW MIGHT START WORKING BUT

05:46:49.321 --> 05:46:50.890
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN STATEWIDE I

05:46:50.956 --> 05:46:52.191
I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT OR

05:46:52.258 --> 05:46:53.392
SOME STEP TO HAVE TO HAPPEN

05:46:53.459 --> 05:46:54.293
STATEWIDE.

05:46:54.360 --> 05:46:55.761
CAN HAPPEN AS A PILOT BECAUSE

05:46:55.828 --> 05:46:57.129
OTHERWISE WE'RE NEVER GONNA

05:46:57.196 --> 05:46:58.731
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN READ THE

05:46:58.797 --> 05:47:00.533
FEAR RETALIATION IS DEFINITELY

05:47:00.599 --> 05:47:02.668
REAL EVEN IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

05:47:02.735 --> 05:47:03.736
AND I AND I WOULD.

05:47:03.802 --> 05:47:04.670
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT THE

05:47:04.737 --> 05:47:06.906
RIGHT ANALOGY BUT TO ME TOO

05:47:06.972 --> 05:47:09.308
MOVEMENT REALLY CREATED FIRST

05:47:09.375 --> 05:47:11.343
THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT WAS

05:47:11.410 --> 05:47:13.179
SAFE FOR PEOPLE WOMEN.

05:47:13.245 --> 05:47:14.647
ESPECIALLY TO FEEL THEY CAN

05:47:14.713 --> 05:47:16.982
RAISE A COMPLAINT OR CONCERNED

05:47:17.049 --> 05:47:18.884
ABOUT BEING HARASSED THAT WAS A

05:47:18.951 --> 05:47:21.253
MAJOR STEP.

05:47:21.320 --> 05:47:22.288
AND FOR THE FOR THEM TO FEEL

05:47:22.354 --> 05:47:23.055
THAT SAFE PLACE AND WE GOT TO

05:47:23.122 --> 05:47:24.790
CREATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT LEASE

05:47:24.857 --> 05:47:26.392
FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO FEEL

05:47:26.458 --> 05:47:28.460
THREATENED EVEN AFTER YOU KNOW

05:47:28.527 --> 05:47:29.828
THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

05:47:29.895 --> 05:47:31.564
AGAIN IT'S NOT A REFLECTION ON

05:47:31.630 --> 05:47:33.365
THE GOOD PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO

05:47:33.432 --> 05:47:34.266
DO THE RIGHT THING.

05:47:34.333 --> 05:47:36.268
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT IS IS

05:47:36.335 --> 05:47:38.237
THAT THE IF YOU'RE A CONCERN

05:47:38.304 --> 05:47:40.005
THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU

05:47:40.072 --> 05:47:40.673
YOU TURN THERE'S BEEN OTHER PASS

05:47:40.739 --> 05:47:42.074
SO MAYBE IT'S STRICTLY TO THE

05:47:42.141 --> 05:47:43.309
APARTMENTS WHERE PEOPLE FEEL

05:47:43.375 --> 05:47:45.110
LIKE THEY CAN EXPRESS BECAUSE

05:47:45.177 --> 05:47:47.179
OTHERWISE.

05:47:47.246 --> 05:47:52.384
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IS THAT THE

05:47:52.451 --> 05:47:53.452
PERSON THE PERSON YOU HAVE TO

05:47:53.519 --> 05:47:54.853
TALK TO ABOUT THIS IS THE RIGHT

05:47:54.920 --> 05:47:55.621
PERSON YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.

05:47:55.688 --> 05:47:56.989
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

05:47:57.056 --> 05:47:57.656
TOO THE OTHER THING I WOULD MAKE

05:47:57.723 --> 05:47:58.290
NOTE -- SINCE THIS IS A BUDGET

05:47:58.357 --> 05:47:58.924
SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN

05:47:58.991 --> 05:47:59.725
SERVICES AND WE DON'T JUST DO

05:47:59.792 --> 05:48:01.760
THIS THE APARTMENT -- YOU KNOW

05:48:01.827 --> 05:48:04.129
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING -- MY

05:48:04.196 --> 05:48:05.864
MIND APPROPRIATELY THAT WE DO

05:48:05.931 --> 05:48:08.367
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING ON EVERY

05:48:08.434 --> 05:48:10.903

GOOD THING.

05:48:14.173 --> 05:48:16.108
WELL WHAT HAPPENS WE START

05:48:16.175 --> 05:48:17.676
PICKING UP ALL THOSE KIDS DO YOU

05:48:17.743 --> 05:48:18.911
THINK YOU KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT

05:48:18.978 --> 05:48:20.312
THE PERCENTAGE SO IT WAS ON A

05:48:20.379 --> 05:48:22.715
REFERENCE TO THE THE AUDIT

05:48:22.781 --> 05:48:26.018
REPORT THAT SHOWED UP MOST TO

05:48:26.085 --> 05:48:27.486
THE OUT BY KIDS ARE GETTING.

05:48:27.553 --> 05:48:28.320
THERE PREVENTIVE CARE AND THAT

05:48:28.387 --> 05:48:29.154
INCLUDES THE DEVELOPMENTAL

05:48:29.221 --> 05:48:30.522
SCREENING.

05:48:30.589 --> 05:48:32.391
OKAY NOW WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING

05:48:32.458 --> 05:48:34.526
THAT AND HOPEFULLY WILL FIX THAT

05:48:34.593 --> 05:48:35.928
RIGHT AND THEN ALL HAPPEN IS

05:48:35.995 --> 05:48:36.528
WE'RE GONNA TRY TO SCREEN ALL

THOSE WE HAVE A NEW SURGEON

05:48:37.463 --> 05:48:39.031

IS AND ADVERSE TO OUT EVENTS --

05:48:42.368 --> 05:48:43.669

NOW GOING TO BE GETTING ALL OF

05:48:45.804 --> 05:48:51.210
THOSE REFERRALS.

05:48:51.277 --> 05:48:52.778
SENATOR IF -- YOU KNOW I THINK

05:48:52.845 --> 05:48:54.313

05:49:03.355 --> 05:49:06.058
INCLUDES -- SO WHEN WE TRY TO

05:49:06.125 --> 05:49:09.995
FIX THAT PROBLEM IN THE MEDIC

05:49:10.062 --> 05:49:11.764
OUTSIDE AND SO FORTH.

05:49:11.830 --> 05:49:12.331
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WAVE OF

05:49:12.398 --> 05:49:13.399
PEOPLE COMING OVER THIS WAY AND

05:49:13.465 --> 05:49:14.967
THEY FEEL LIKE THAT AND THEN IF

THEY DON'T GET SERVICE HERE AND

05:49:17.069 --> 05:49:19.104
SO WE CAN GET YEAH THAT'S GOING

05:49:19.171 --> 05:49:21.473
TO BE A PROBLEM SO YEAH.

05:49:21.540 --> 05:49:22.808

05:49:34.653 --> 05:49:35.921
REALLY RESOLVE A LOT OF THESE

05:49:35.988 --> 05:49:37.690
CHALLENGES BUT I THINK ONE OF

05:49:37.756 --> 05:49:39.491
THE KEY ITEMS THAT I BELIEVE WE

05:49:39.558 --> 05:49:41.026
CAN WORK COLLABORATIVE TOGETHER.

05:49:41.093 --> 05:49:45.164

RETALIATION WILL HAPPEN I

05:50:01.480 --> 05:50:03.415
BELIEVE A LOT OF GROUND COULD BE

05:50:03.482 --> 05:50:05.284
COVERED QUICKLY.

05:50:05.351 --> 05:50:07.953

06:05:41.052 --> 06:05:42.754
AND THIS IS A PROMISE THE

06:05:42.820 --> 06:05:43.388
REGIONAL CENTERS ARE STRUGGLING

06:05:43.454 --> 06:05:45.223
TO KEEP.

06:05:45.290 --> 06:05:47.892
WE HAVE A COMPLEX ARRAY OF

06:05:47.959 --> 06:05:50.261
CASELOAD RATIOS.

06:05:50.328 --> 06:05:51.796
BUT IN NO CASE.

06:05:51.863 --> 06:05:53.131
HAVE WE PROMISED ANYTHING

06:05:53.197 --> 06:05:54.966
GREATER THAN A ONE TO SIXTY SIX

06:05:55.033 --> 06:05:56.834
CASELOAD RATIO.

06:05:56.901 --> 06:05:58.770
TODAY MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS

06:05:58.836 --> 06:05:59.904
OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTED BY

06:05:59.971 --> 06:06:01.439
REGIONAL CENTERS ARE IN CASE

06:06:01.506 --> 06:06:02.907
LOADS OF GREATER THAN SEVENTY

06:06:02.974 --> 06:06:05.376
PEOPLE SO OVER THREE QUARTERS OF

06:06:05.443 --> 06:06:06.344
THE PEOPLE.

06:06:06.411 --> 06:06:07.945
ARE BEING SHORT CHANGED THEIR

06:06:08.012 --> 06:06:11.916
SERVICE COORDINATION TIME.

06:06:11.983 --> 06:06:13.618
AS CASELOADS GET LARGER.

06:06:13.685 --> 06:06:15.019
AND DOCUMENTATION EXPECTED GREAT

06:06:15.086 --> 06:06:18.256
EXPECTATIONS GET MORE ONEROUS.

06:06:18.323 --> 06:06:20.525
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT SERVICE

06:06:20.591 --> 06:06:21.793
COORDINATORS?

06:06:21.859 --> 06:06:23.728
CHECK BOXES.

06:06:23.795 --> 06:06:25.196
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS

06:06:25.263 --> 06:06:28.766
THAT CAN BE AUDITED AND COUNTED.

06:06:28.833 --> 06:06:30.535
AND WHAT WE LOSE IN THAT PROCESS

06:06:30.601 --> 06:06:31.936
WHEN A CASELOAD RATIO IS TOO

06:06:32.003 --> 06:06:33.571
HIGH.

06:06:33.638 --> 06:06:34.872
IS THE QUALITY OF THE

06:06:34.939 --> 06:06:37.208
INTERACTION INTERACTIONS BECOME

06:06:37.275 --> 06:06:38.643
MORE TRANSACTIONAL.

06:06:38.710 --> 06:06:39.944
AND THE TIME FOR CULTIVATING

06:06:40.011 --> 06:06:42.046
STRONG TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS IS

06:06:42.113 --> 06:06:44.148
WHAT GETS SACRIFICED.

06:06:44.215 --> 06:06:46.551
TODAY THE STATE IS SIX HUNDRED

06:06:46.617 --> 06:06:47.151
NINETY ONE SERVICE COORDINATOR

06:06:47.218 --> 06:06:48.753
SHORT.

06:06:48.820 --> 06:06:50.355
FROM WHAT WE WERE PROMISED THE

06:06:50.421 --> 06:06:51.122
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT WE

06:06:51.189 --> 06:06:52.390
KNOW MAKES REGIONAL CENTER

06:06:52.457 --> 06:06:55.193
SPECIAL AND SETS THEM APART FROM

06:06:55.259 --> 06:06:55.493
[inaudible]

06:06:55.560 --> 06:06:58.162
ELIGIBILITY WORKERS.

06:06:58.229 --> 06:06:59.364
REGIONAL CENTERS PRIORITIZE

06:06:59.430 --> 06:07:01.632
SERVICE COORDINATION.

06:07:01.699 --> 06:07:03.134
BUT THIS REQUIRES THAT THEY

06:07:03.201 --> 06:07:05.803
SACRIFICE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE

06:07:05.870 --> 06:07:07.205
BUDGETED SERVICE COORDINATION

06:07:07.271 --> 06:07:10.608
WAGES AND BENEFITS ARE ABOUT 57%

06:07:10.675 --> 06:07:13.444
OF THE ACTUAL COST OF AN F. DESK

06:07:13.511 --> 06:07:14.512
YOU TO WRAP UP JEFF AND I ASSUME

06:07:14.579 --> 06:07:17.148
YOU WANT ACTUALLY GET TO YOUR

06:07:17.215 --> 06:07:18.449
REQUEST.

06:07:18.516 --> 06:07:19.317
OUR REQUESTS ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT

06:07:19.384 --> 06:07:19.951
FORWARD AND THEY'RE ALL TIED TO

06:07:20.017 --> 06:07:22.887
THIS.

06:07:22.954 --> 06:07:24.689
SINCE THE LAST TIME.

06:07:24.756 --> 06:07:26.724
REGIONAL CENTERS RECEIVED AN

06:07:26.791 --> 06:07:29.861
INFLUX OF MONEY FOR OPERATIONS.

06:07:29.927 --> 06:07:32.397
THE CPI HAS INCREASED BY 8% THE

06:07:32.463 --> 06:07:34.665
CALIFORNIA WAGE INDEX BY TWELVE

06:07:34.732 --> 06:07:38.569
SO THERE'S A REQUEST FOR AN 8%.

06:07:38.636 --> 06:07:40.972
DOWN PAYMENT FOR RETENTION AND

06:07:41.038 --> 06:07:43.307
COMPETITIVE WAGES.

06:07:43.374 --> 06:07:45.243
IT WOULD COST AN ADDITIONAL

06:07:45.309 --> 06:07:46.411
THIRTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION

06:07:46.477 --> 06:07:52.183
GENERAL FUND. TO BACK FILL THE

06:07:52.250 --> 06:07:52.784
SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE MISSING

06:07:52.850 --> 06:07:53.785

06:07:53.851 --> 06:07:55.219
SUPERVISION.

06:07:55.286 --> 06:07:57.922
AND IF WE WERE TO TRY TO BRING.

06:07:57.989 --> 06:08:00.825
REGIONAL CENTERS BUDGETED.

06:08:00.892 --> 06:08:02.427
SALARIES FOR SERVICE

06:08:02.493 --> 06:08:04.228
COORDINATION UP TO CURRENT

06:08:04.295 --> 06:08:06.130
STANDARDS IT WOULD BE ONE

06:08:06.197 --> 06:08:06.664
HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MILLION

06:08:06.731 --> 06:08:08.466
DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY

06:08:08.533 --> 06:08:10.001
WHICH IS A BIG INVESTMENT.

06:08:10.067 --> 06:08:11.402
BUT IT'S BECAUSE THE SYSTEM HAS

06:08:11.469 --> 06:08:15.306
BEEN STAR FOR SO LONG SO.

06:08:15.373 --> 06:08:17.675
THAT'S IT OKAY.

COLLABORATIVE -- NE OF THE

06:11:53.190 --> 06:11:54.959
THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MENTION

06:11:55.026 --> 06:11:57.495
IS DAY MIS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

06:11:57.561 --> 06:11:59.697
THE FAMILY IT'S AN AND THEIR

06:11:59.764 --> 06:12:00.965
REGIONAL CENTER.

06:12:01.032 --> 06:12:05.503
NOW -- WORKING WITH FAMILIES IREALIZE THAT IT'S A BIG ISSUE

06:12:05.569 --> 06:12:08.072
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S NOT

06:12:08.139 --> 06:12:12.009
TRANSLATED -- GOOD ENOUGH OR OR

06:12:12.076 --> 06:12:13.678
WERE THEY JUST.

06:12:13.744 --> 06:12:16.013
DON KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE SO I

06:12:16.080 --> 06:12:18.649
THINK YOU FROM.

06:12:18.716 --> 06:12:20.251
WE FIND A WAIT FOR THE REGIONAL

06:12:20.317 --> 06:12:23.220
CENTER TO TELL THE FAMILIES.

06:12:23.287 --> 06:12:24.255
IN ALL.

06:12:24.321 --> 06:12:26.857
ON ONE WAY.

06:12:26.924 --> 06:12:29.026
IT WILL BE WAY FOR MUCH BETTER

06:12:29.093 --> 06:12:30.027
FOR THE FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND

06:12:30.094 --> 06:12:33.664
IT OR EITHER -- SO EVERYBODY

06:12:33.731 --> 06:12:35.032
COULD KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE

06:12:35.099 --> 06:12:38.903
NOW I FIND OUT THAT A LOT OF A

06:12:38.969 --> 06:12:40.971
LOT OF OUR CASES ARE A LOT OF

06:12:41.038 --> 06:12:42.473
MISCOMMUNICATION.

06:12:42.540 --> 06:12:44.308
AND THEN THE FAMILY DON'T

06:12:44.375 --> 06:12:45.509
UNDERSTAND THE SERVICES -- THEY

06:12:45.576 --> 06:12:47.311
DON'T KNOW WHAT THERE IS.

06:12:47.378 --> 06:12:49.747
OR OR THEY REGIONAL CENTER THE

06:12:49.814 --> 06:12:50.848
SERVICE COORDINATORS TELLS THEM

06:12:50.915 --> 06:12:51.982
THE NAME OF THE SERVICE BUT THEY

06:12:52.049 --> 06:12:54.585
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COVERS.

06:12:54.652 --> 06:12:56.387
SO I THINK A MUSE COMMUNICATION

06:12:56.454 --> 06:12:59.056
IS A BIG ISSUE WITH THE REGIONAL

06:12:59.123 --> 06:13:01.125

HARD WORK.

06:14:34.585 --> 06:14:36.253
THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

06:14:36.320 --> 06:14:39.390

06:14:39.456 --> 06:14:40.624
BY ALL DAY USES BUT UP THIS

06:14:40.691 --> 06:14:42.059
PETITIONS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN

06:14:42.126 --> 06:14:44.929
THE ACTUAL RESULTS. TO THE POINT

06:14:44.995 --> 06:14:45.863
THAT I HE GIVES THE IMPRESSION

06:14:45.930 --> 06:14:47.031
THAT THERE IS NO SENSE OF

06:14:47.097 --> 06:14:49.333
URGENCY IN SOME AREAS.

06:14:49.400 --> 06:14:50.768
UP THE SAID THE THIS A CULTURAL

06:14:50.835 --> 06:14:53.370
ISSUE.

06:14:53.437 --> 06:14:54.738

06:14:57.107 --> 06:14:58.275
WHICH I DEFINITELY DISAGREED BUT

06:14:58.342 --> 06:15:00.277
IS MORE THAN -- REGIONAL CENTERS

06:15:00.344 --> 06:15:02.379
CULTURE IN THE WAY OF THESE

06:15:02.446 --> 06:15:03.948
FAMILIES ARE ARE BEING.

06:15:04.014 --> 06:15:05.182

06:15:06.317 --> 06:15:08.886
AND IT EXPOSES THE LACK OF US

06:15:08.953 --> 06:15:10.654
SINCE THE SENSITIVITY AND SENSE

06:15:10.721 --> 06:15:12.756
OF URGENCY ALSO.

06:15:12.823 --> 06:15:14.558

06:15:15.893 --> 06:15:17.194

THIRTY THREE YEARS -- AND I'VE

06:15:32.243 --> 06:15:34.511
HAD CASELOADS IN THE SIXTIES AND

06:15:34.578 --> 06:15:35.045
I'VE HAD CASELOADS IN THE

06:15:35.112 --> 06:15:36.347
HUNDREDS.

06:15:36.413 --> 06:15:37.982
OVER A HUNDRED AND I KNOW WHAT

06:15:38.048 --> 06:15:39.416
THAT LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF THE

06:15:39.483 --> 06:15:41.585
DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF

06:15:41.652 --> 06:15:43.320
SERVICES ARE I CAN PROVIDE.

06:15:43.387 --> 06:15:44.955
WHEN YOU GET A CASE LOAD ITS WAY

06:15:45.022 --> 06:15:46.924
OUT OF COMPLIANCE ALL YOU CAN DO

06:15:46.991 --> 06:15:49.994
IS MANAGE EMERGENCIES AND THE

06:15:50.060 --> 06:15:53.530
THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR'S LOOK --

06:15:53.597 --> 06:15:55.165
FOR YOUR BILL YOU REALLY GET TO

06:15:55.232 --> 06:15:56.100
KNOW FAMILIES AND AND SUPPORT

06:15:56.166 --> 06:15:57.534
FAMILIES IS JUST INCREDIBLY

06:15:57.601 --> 06:15:59.069
DIMINISHED AND THAT'S ONLY

06:15:59.136 --> 06:16:00.271
AMPLIFIED FOR SERVICE

06:16:00.337 --> 06:16:01.305
COORDINATORS.

06:16:01.372 --> 06:16:03.707
WHO ARE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WHO

06:16:03.774 --> 06:16:04.475
SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN

06:16:04.541 --> 06:16:07.544
ENGLISH -- THERE YOU KNOW

06:16:07.611 --> 06:16:08.812
THERE'S A LOT MORE.

06:16:08.879 --> 06:16:11.348
CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING AN

06:16:11.415 --> 06:16:13.150
EXPLANATION IT'S REQUIRED THIS

06:16:13.217 --> 06:16:15.352
TRANSLATION THAT'S REQUIRED --

06:16:15.419 --> 06:16:17.721
AND IF ANYTHING THEY SHOULD HAVE

06:16:17.788 --> 06:16:19.056
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CASE LOADS

06:16:19.123 --> 06:16:19.857
AND THE REST OF US OFF IN THE

06:16:19.924 --> 06:16:21.926
END UP HIGHER BECAUSE WE HAVE

06:16:21.992 --> 06:16:23.260
DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING PEOPLE

06:16:23.327 --> 06:16:24.595

CULTURAL SKILLS A SERVICE

06:16:26.263 --> 06:16:27.498
COORDINATOR.

06:16:27.564 --> 06:16:29.500
WITH THE WAGES WE PAY AND AND

06:16:29.566 --> 06:16:30.467
THE PROBLEM ISN'T REGIONAL

06:16:30.534 --> 06:16:32.403
CENTERS ARE TRYING TO HIRE

06:16:32.469 --> 06:16:34.772
SERVICE COORDINATORS -- AND AND

06:16:34.838 --> 06:16:36.674
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET WERE

06:16:36.740 --> 06:16:38.008
BUDGETED FOR ENOUGH.

06:16:38.075 --> 06:16:39.643
BUT THE AMOUNT THAT WE BUDGET

06:16:39.710 --> 06:16:41.178
FOR EACH SERVICE COORDINATOR IS

06:16:41.245 --> 06:16:43.213
BASED ON NUMBERS.

06:16:43.280 --> 06:16:44.715
THAT WERE SET IN.

06:16:44.782 --> 06:16:45.883
TWO THOUSAND ONE AND WE CAN'T

06:16:45.950 --> 06:16:46.784

WAGES YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET

06:16:48.018 --> 06:16:49.186
CHANGE PROPOSALS FROM THE

06:16:49.253 --> 06:16:49.987
DEPARTMENT.

06:16:50.054 --> 06:16:52.156
NONE OF THEM ARE BASED ON WAGES

06:16:52.222 --> 06:16:53.390
THAT IT WOULD HIGH COST THEM TO

06:16:53.457 --> 06:16:57.194
HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES IN -- TWO

06:16:57.261 --> 06:16:58.329

06:17:06.837 --> 06:17:08.339
LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE OF

06:17:08.405 --> 06:17:11.642
DISPARITIES -- YEAR QUESTIONS

06:17:11.709 --> 06:17:14.578
WERE ARE REALLY AB BUT WHERE IT

06:17:14.645 --> 06:17:15.479
EFFECTED ME GREATLY - I JUST

06:17:15.546 --> 06:17:16.814
WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS

06:17:16.880 --> 06:17:19.416
THAT -- INTIMIDATION ISRAEL THIS

06:17:19.483 --> 06:17:22.086
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS BEING.

06:17:22.152 --> 06:17:24.254
FABRICATED -- THERE WERE PARENTS

06:17:24.321 --> 06:17:26.023
WE WANTED TO COME HERE AND SPEAK

06:17:26.090 --> 06:17:28.092
BUT THEY WERE AFRAID AFRAID THAT

06:17:28.158 --> 06:17:30.060
SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THEIR

06:17:30.127 --> 06:17:32.129
SERVICE THEIR CHILD SERVICES --

06:17:32.196 --> 06:17:33.764
AND THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO

06:17:33.831 --> 06:17:35.799
MAKE IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW

06:17:35.866 --> 06:17:37.334
WHETHER ANY OF THE GREAT OF THE

06:17:37.401 --> 06:17:39.169
PROJECTS HAVE WORKED WE REALLY

06:17:39.236 --> 06:17:40.738
DON'T KNOW IT EVERYTHING IS SELF

06:17:40.804 --> 06:17:41.638
REPORTING.

06:17:41.705 --> 06:17:42.973
AND WE HAVE TO HAVE AN

06:17:43.040 --> 06:17:44.641
INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS I WAS THE

06:17:44.708 --> 06:17:46.477
LEAD RESEARCHER ON OUR PAPER ON

06:17:49.446 --> 06:17:50.180
NUMBERS THAT ARE PUBLICLY

06:17:50.247 --> 06:17:51.715
AVAILABLE THERE ARE NEW NUMBERS

06:17:51.782 --> 06:17:53.484
THE DDS CAN MAKE AVAILABLE TO ME.

06:17:53.550 --> 06:17:55.152
I WILL RUN THOSE NUMBERS AS WELL

06:17:55.219 --> 06:17:56.387
BUT THE DISPARITIES OF ACTUALLY

06:17:56.453 --> 06:17:57.888
GOTTEN WORSE IN THE LAST TWO

06:17:57.955 --> 06:17:58.622
YEARS.

06:17:58.689 --> 06:18:00.858
AND SO IT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME

06:18:00.924 --> 06:18:02.226
SORT OF INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS AND

06:18:02.292 --> 06:18:03.894

CHALLENGES WITH OUR COMMUNITY

COMPLETED YET WE'RE TRYING TO

06:30:36.946 --> 06:30:38.047
ALSO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF

06:30:38.114 --> 06:30:39.682
SYSTEMS WE PUT IN PLACE FOR

06:30:39.749 --> 06:30:41.484
PARTICULARLY THE MOST THE OTHER

06:30:41.551 --> 06:30:43.787
TO THE HIGHEST NEEDS -- PEOPLE

06:30:43.853 --> 06:30:45.421
INCLUDING CHILDREN I APPRECIATE

06:30:45.488 --> 06:30:47.423
THAT WERE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT A

06:30:47.490 --> 06:30:48.925

FEDERAL WAIVER AND SO FORTH --

06:30:52.295 --> 06:30:53.730

06:30:53.797 --> 06:30:55.398
HEARING HERE IS THAT -- AND WE

06:30:55.465 --> 06:30:57.333

06:30:57.400 --> 06:30:58.902
UNDERLYING THE DISPARITIES.

06:31:08.111 --> 06:31:09.746
I THINK EVEN AS WE LOOK AT SOME

06:31:09.813 --> 06:31:11.648
OF THESE RESOURCES WE'VE GOT TO

06:31:11.714 --> 06:31:13.950

DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES BUT I

06:31:27.063 --> 06:31:28.097
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT

WORKING VERY HARD T DEDICATE IS

06:31:37.407 --> 06:31:38.775
NOT THE KIND OF JOB YOU GO INTO

06:31:38.842 --> 06:31:40.143

06:49:43.725 --> 06:49:47.896
APPROVAL FOR THE PROJECT WHICH

06:49:47.963 --> 06:49:48.797
SHOULD BE PHASES.

06:49:48.864 --> 06:49:49.431
TWO THREE FOUR SO IT'S A LITTLE

06:49:49.498 --> 06:49:51.266
BIT DIFFERENT FROM -- OTHER PAL --

06:49:51.333 --> 06:49:53.902
PROJECTS.

06:49:53.969 --> 06:49:54.970
THAT'S AT A HIGH LEVEL UNLESS

06:49:55.037 --> 06:49:56.571
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS.

06:49:56.638 --> 06:50:00.442
OKAY -- COME A FELLOW COMES.

06:50:00.509 --> 06:50:02.778
PRIME MINISTER ALEJO -- HI SOME

06:50:02.844 --> 06:50:03.912
OF MY COMMENTS OF OR EVEN MADE

06:50:03.979 --> 06:50:05.714
SO I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT SHORTER --

06:50:05.781 --> 06:50:07.115
SO AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS

06:50:07.182 --> 06:50:08.617
STILL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS

06:50:08.684 --> 06:50:09.518
TO PROVIDE LIFE CYCLE TO

06:50:09.584 --> 06:50:11.119
ANTICIPATED TO COMPLETE IN

06:50:11.186 --> 06:50:13.722
FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND AS

06:50:13.789 --> 06:50:14.589
WAS MENTIONED THIS IS BEING USED

06:50:14.656 --> 06:50:16.358
AS A KIND OF PILOT ARE PROOF OF

06:50:16.425 --> 06:50:17.659
CONCEPT FOR THE SMALLER

06:50:17.726 --> 06:50:19.194
COMPONENT OF MEDS THEY TRY A

06:50:19.261 --> 06:50:20.462
SYSTEM -- TO AT LEAST

06:50:20.529 --> 06:50:21.496
DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE

06:50:21.563 --> 06:50:22.698
UNDERLYING DEVELOPMENT

06:50:22.764 --> 06:50:24.266
ENVIRONMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE --

06:50:24.333 --> 06:50:25.500
WE GENERALLY AGREE WITH THIS

06:50:25.567 --> 06:50:27.302
APPROACH HAS A SIZEABLE COMPLEX

06:50:27.369 --> 06:50:29.204
PROJECT -- BUT WE ARE CONCERNED

06:50:29.271 --> 06:50:30.672
THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS BEING

06:50:30.739 --> 06:50:32.841
ASKED TO APPROVE FUNDING -- FOR

06:50:32.908 --> 06:50:33.675
DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION

06:50:33.742 --> 06:50:35.677
ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THAT PHASE

06:50:35.744 --> 06:50:37.212
ONE INTO PHASE TWO THERE'S

06:50:37.279 --> 06:50:38.480
THERE'S A A COMPONENT OF IT

06:50:38.547 --> 06:50:40.082
THAT'S ACTUALLY STARTING --

06:50:40.148 --> 06:50:42.250
WITHIN NINETEEN TWENTY AND SO --

06:50:42.317 --> 06:50:44.052
THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEN HAVE A

06:50:44.119 --> 06:50:46.955
COMPLETE PROJECT PLAN -- BE READ

06:50:47.022 --> 06:50:48.223
BEFORE IT AND NOW IT TO ITS

06:50:48.290 --> 06:50:50.659
EVALUATE -- IN SO WE'RE ALSO

06:50:50.726 --> 06:50:51.893
CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPROVAL OF

06:50:51.960 --> 06:50:53.462
RESOURCES INTO THE OUT YEARS

06:50:53.528 --> 06:50:55.297
GIVEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

06:50:55.364 --> 06:50:57.199
THE COMPLETE PROJECT PLAN BEFORE

06:50:57.265 --> 06:51:00.902
US -- BE YOU KNOW IN FEBRUARY

06:51:00.969 --> 06:51:01.536
TWENTY TWENTY AND SO TO ADDRESS

06:51:01.603 --> 06:51:02.137
THESE CONCERNS THE LEGISLATURE

06:51:02.204 --> 06:51:03.238
MIGHT JUST ASK THE MINISTRATION

06:51:03.305 --> 06:51:05.207
TO EXPLAIN WHY -- BUT YOU'RE

06:51:05.273 --> 06:51:06.875
FUNDING IS NECESSARY FOR FACE TO

06:51:06.942 --> 06:51:08.777
ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY AND THEN

06:51:08.844 --> 06:51:10.579
TO EXPLAIN WHY THE FOR YOUR

06:51:10.645 --> 06:51:11.913
LIMITED TERM FUNDING IS

06:51:11.980 --> 06:51:13.081
NECESSARY FOR THE PROJECT GIVEN

06:51:13.148 --> 06:51:17.185
LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE A

06:51:17.252 --> 06:51:18.887
COMPLETE PLAN AT THIS TIME.

06:51:18.954 --> 06:51:20.589
OKAY FINANCE COMMENTS --

06:51:20.655 --> 06:51:21.890
TECHNOLOGY COMMENTS.

06:51:21.957 --> 06:51:22.557
FROM THAT TECHNOLOGIES

06:51:22.624 --> 06:51:24.126
PERSPECTIVE THE ESTIMATES FOR

06:51:24.192 --> 06:51:25.594
THE PROJECT WERE SUBSTANTIATED

06:51:25.660 --> 06:51:26.928
THROUGH THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT

06:51:26.995 --> 06:51:29.164
THE DEPARTMENT IS DONE.

06:51:29.231 --> 06:51:30.832
IN STATES.

06:51:30.899 --> 06:51:32.467
TO AND LIKE I BRIAN WAS SAYING

06:51:32.534 --> 06:51:34.302
THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE

06:51:34.369 --> 06:51:35.103
EFFORT.

06:51:35.170 --> 06:51:36.238
REQUIRED US TO TAKE A DIFFERENT

06:51:36.304 --> 06:51:38.106
APPROACH WITH HOW WERE APPROVING

06:51:38.173 --> 06:51:39.207
THE PROJECT OVERALL WHERE THEY

06:51:39.274 --> 06:51:40.742
CAN SUBSTANTIATE THIS THROUGH

06:51:40.809 --> 06:51:41.977
THE PROOF OF CONCEPT.

06:51:42.044 --> 06:51:43.445
OKAY THANK YOU.

06:51:43.512 --> 06:51:47.115
THAT WOULD TO LIKE TO DO YOU

06:51:47.182 --> 06:51:50.085
HAVE A COMMON SUN VALLEY IS --

06:51:50.152 --> 06:51:51.653
DON'T HAVE PLEASE DON'T MIND.

06:51:51.720 --> 06:51:53.288
SO WITH REGARDS TO THE LIMITED

06:51:53.355 --> 06:51:55.524
TERM FUNDING FOR THE RESOURCES

06:51:55.590 --> 06:51:57.392
THAT WE ARE REQUESTING THAT

06:51:57.459 --> 06:52:00.595
BECAUSE IT'S IT CAN BE DIFFICULT

06:52:00.662 --> 06:52:02.864
TO KEEP CONSISTENT STAFFING --

06:52:02.931 --> 06:52:04.766
WHEN IT'S A WIN WIN YOUR GET

06:52:04.833 --> 06:52:06.034
WHEN YOU'RE BY WHEN YOU'RE

06:52:06.101 --> 06:52:07.436
FUNDING BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL?

06:52:07.502 --> 06:52:08.303
YOU KNOW FOR SOME STABILITY Là

06:52:08.370 --> 06:52:09.504
MOVED TO THE POSITION SO WE'RE

06:52:09.571 --> 06:52:10.906
REALLY ASKING FOR THIS FOR YEARS

06:52:10.972 --> 06:52:12.741
TO CARRY US THROUGH WHAT WE

06:52:12.808 --> 06:52:13.542
BELIEVE WILL BE THE ENTIRE

06:52:13.608 --> 06:52:14.443
PROJECT.

06:52:14.509 --> 06:52:15.944
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SOME

06:52:16.011 --> 06:52:20.115
CONSISTENCY -- ACROSS THE

06:52:20.182 --> 06:52:20.649
PROJECT NO KNOWLEDGE BASIC

06:52:20.715 --> 06:52:21.616
CETERA.

06:52:21.683 --> 06:52:22.184
SO THAT'S THAT WOULD BE THE

06:52:22.250 --> 06:52:23.118
REASONING FOR THAT.

06:52:23.185 --> 06:52:24.753
THE SECOND PIECE I CAN'T

06:52:24.820 --> 06:52:27.722
REMEMBER THE QUESTION WAS NOW --

06:52:27.789 --> 06:52:29.357
BOTH ALLOCATING MONEY FOR OR THE

06:52:29.424 --> 06:52:30.992
FACE TO ADDRESS THESE TWO

06:52:31.059 --> 06:52:32.828
ACTIVITY WHICH MAY NOT WHICH ONE

06:52:32.894 --> 06:52:34.696
THE STORY TAKE PLACE UNTIL NEXT

06:52:34.763 --> 06:52:36.331
BUDGET YEAR RAIDER LATE.

06:52:36.398 --> 06:52:37.933
OUR RELEASE IN THE SPRING THERE

06:52:37.999 --> 06:52:39.367
WILL BE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS THAT

06:52:39.434 --> 06:52:40.902
SAY BUDGET YEAR BUT AGAIN THE

06:52:40.969 --> 06:52:42.370
RIGHT REMAINDER OF THE FACE TO

06:52:42.437 --> 06:52:45.874
ACTIVITIES ARE A MORE FIRMLY HOW

06:52:45.941 --> 06:52:46.374
WE EXERCISE LEGISLATIVE

06:52:46.441 --> 06:52:47.042
OVERSIGHT.

06:52:47.109 --> 06:52:47.676
SO I THINK THE THE REASON WE'VE

06:52:47.742 --> 06:52:49.377
REQUESTED THAT IS WE'LL HAVE A

06:52:49.444 --> 06:52:50.779
CONTRACTOR ON BOARD WHO WILL OF

06:52:50.846 --> 06:52:52.514
WORK PHASE ONE THE GOAL IS. TO

06:52:52.581 --> 06:52:54.116
GET APPROVAL WITH CDG AND BE

06:52:54.182 --> 06:52:56.618
ABLE TO MOVE DIRECTLY INTO PHASE --

06:52:56.685 --> 06:52:58.553
TWO THE PROJECT YOU KNOW IT IF

06:52:58.620 --> 06:53:00.188
WE HAVE A DELAY OF FOUR MONTHS

06:53:00.255 --> 06:53:01.890
AWAITING APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR

06:53:01.957 --> 06:53:03.859
THE NEXT PHASE WILL ALSO END UP

06:53:03.925 --> 06:53:05.060
HAVING A RESOURCING ISSUE WITH

06:53:05.127 --> 06:53:06.695
REGARDS TO OUR DEVELOPMENT UNDER

06:53:06.761 --> 06:53:07.996
BECAUSE NO WORK.

06:53:08.063 --> 06:53:09.197
YOUR RESOURCES MOVED OTHER

06:53:09.264 --> 06:53:10.732
PROJECTS THAT ARE SO WE'RE

06:53:10.799 --> 06:53:11.566
REALLY LOOKING AT IT FOR

06:53:11.633 --> 06:53:13.101
CONSISTENCY AND NOT HAVING A

06:53:13.168 --> 06:53:14.236
DELAY.

06:53:14.302 --> 06:53:16.004
IN MOVING THIS PART IN MOVING

06:53:16.071 --> 06:53:17.339
THIS FORWARD K. SO.

06:53:17.405 --> 06:53:20.041
IN JAPAN IF I CAN ALSO ADD -- TO

06:53:20.108 --> 06:53:22.277
CYNTHIA'S COMMENTS THAT -- IN IN

06:53:22.344 --> 06:53:23.745
LIEU OF COMING BACK EVERY YEAR

06:53:23.812 --> 06:53:25.313
THROUGH THE THROUGH THE BUDGET

06:53:25.380 --> 06:53:25.780
CYCLE THERE ARE OTHER

06:53:25.847 --> 06:53:27.382
CHECKPOINTS BUILT INTO THE

06:53:27.449 --> 06:53:29.618
PROCESS -- THAT WILL KEEP THE

06:53:29.684 --> 06:53:31.820
COST M. CAPPED AT A AT A CERTAIN

06:53:31.887 --> 06:53:33.054
LEVEL SO.

06:53:33.121 --> 06:53:34.923
AGAIN IF IF THROUGH THE PROOF OF

06:53:34.990 --> 06:53:37.259
CONCEPT WHENTHE PROJECT HAS TO

06:53:37.325 --> 06:53:38.793
FINALIZE THEIR ENTIRE PROJECT

06:53:38.860 --> 06:53:39.794
COST.

06:53:39.861 --> 06:53:41.396
IF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST --

06:53:41.463 --> 06:53:42.831
OVER FIVE MILLION THERE'S CAUSE

06:53:42.898 --> 06:53:44.099
FOR PAWS FOR US TO DISCUSS HOW

06:53:44.166 --> 06:53:45.300
THAT HOW THE PROJECT WOULD MOVE

06:53:45.367 --> 06:53:46.268
FORWARD.

06:53:46.334 --> 06:53:47.869
ADDITIONALLY ONCE THIS PROJECT

06:53:47.936 --> 06:53:50.906
IS AN IN FLIGHT AND THERE IS --

06:53:50.972 --> 06:53:52.274
THEY ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON

06:53:52.340 --> 06:53:53.775
PROJECT ACTIVITIES.

06:53:53.842 --> 06:53:55.510
THE DEPARTMENT WILL FURNISH A

06:53:55.577 --> 06:53:57.145
PROJECT STATUS REPORT DEPARTMENT

06:53:57.212 --> 06:53:58.346
TECHNOLOGY WILL FURNISH AN

06:53:58.413 --> 06:53:59.681
INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT

06:53:59.748 --> 06:54:01.616
REPORT -- WHICH INCLUDES COST

06:54:01.683 --> 06:54:06.488
MANAGEMENT IS ONE OF THE FOCUS

06:54:06.555 --> 06:54:08.323
AREAS THAT WILL REPORT ON SO I

06:54:08.390 --> 06:54:08.957
GUESS NONE OF YOU ARE HERE FOR

06:54:09.024 --> 06:54:09.591
THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION WE HAD

06:54:09.658 --> 06:54:10.192
ABOUT A PROJECT IN THE VOTE

06:54:10.258 --> 06:54:12.360
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES -- BUT

06:54:12.427 --> 06:54:13.828
I'M TRYING TO MAKE SIMILAR

06:54:13.895 --> 06:54:15.864
COMMENTS AND DO IT -- MAYBE THIS

06:54:15.931 --> 06:54:18.567
IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT --

06:54:18.633 --> 06:54:20.936
GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE

06:54:21.002 --> 06:54:23.905
PROCUREMENT PROCESS -- WE PRIDE

06:54:23.972 --> 06:54:26.007
NEED TO THINK ABOUT.

06:54:26.074 --> 06:54:27.409
GIVEN THE NATURE OF TIME LINES

06:54:27.475 --> 06:54:29.211
AND SO FORTH -- BECAUSE I HEAR

06:54:29.277 --> 06:54:30.378
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT

06:54:30.445 --> 06:54:33.148
CONTINUITY AND AND AND SO FORTH

06:54:33.215 --> 06:54:35.150
AND I APPRECIATE THE ACTIONS

06:54:35.217 --> 06:54:37.352
THAT TO BE SURE WE ALSO MAINTAIN

06:54:37.419 --> 06:54:38.853
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND WHEN I

06:54:38.920 --> 06:54:40.188
SAW LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IT'S

06:54:40.255 --> 06:54:41.923
NOT JUST THE MONEY PART SO WHAT

06:54:41.990 --> 06:54:43.558
THE RESPONSE IS ALWAYS BEEN WELL

06:54:43.625 --> 06:54:44.092
YOU KNOW ABOUT THE MONEY.

06:54:44.159 --> 06:54:45.093
IT'S ADDRESS.

06:54:45.160 --> 06:54:47.195
AND IT IS TO SOME OF THAT FOR

06:54:47.262 --> 06:54:49.297
EXAMPLE SOMEONE MAY COME AND I

06:54:49.364 --> 06:54:50.999
THINK -- YOU TOO BYE KNOW THIS

06:54:51.066 --> 06:54:52.500
BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHENEVER

06:54:52.567 --> 06:54:53.702
WE HAVE OUR HEARINGS RIGHT SOME

06:54:53.768 --> 06:54:55.170
OF THE STAKEHOLDER MAY COME AND

06:54:55.237 --> 06:54:56.871
SAY LOOK YOU KNOW THE THE PRINT

06:54:56.938 --> 06:54:58.673
OUT YOUR AND WAS IN FACE TO YOUR

06:54:58.740 --> 06:54:59.841
FIGURE OUT YOU'RE A WHAT THE

06:54:59.908 --> 06:55:02.510
SCOPE AND SO FORTH AND THE DAY

06:55:02.577 --> 06:55:02.811
HE DIDN'T.

06:55:02.877 --> 06:55:04.079
HEAR FROM US ARE DATED -- DARE

06:55:04.145 --> 06:55:06.348
NOT LISTENING TO US WE SAID THAT --

06:55:06.414 --> 06:55:07.115
YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE NOT

06:55:07.182 --> 06:55:08.483
COOPERATING THIS INTO YOUR

06:55:08.550 --> 06:55:10.418
UNDERLYING PROJECT DESIGN OR

06:55:10.485 --> 06:55:11.987
WHATEVER ELSE RIGHT AND SO THAT

06:55:12.053 --> 06:55:13.788
OVERSIGHT IS NOT JUST THE AMOUNT

06:55:13.855 --> 06:55:15.890
OF MONEY IT'S ALSO ABOUT BEING

06:55:15.957 --> 06:55:18.260
SURE THAT -- BEFORE WE ACTUALLY

06:55:18.326 --> 06:55:20.061
PURCHASE -- RIGHT OR EVEN SEND

06:55:20.128 --> 06:55:21.730
OUT THE R. F. P. AND SAY THIS IS

06:55:21.796 --> 06:55:24.366
THE PARAMETERS THAT WERE ABLE TO

06:55:24.432 --> 06:55:26.067
COME IN AND AND AND AND HAVE

06:55:26.134 --> 06:55:27.202
THAT CONVERSATION IF.

06:55:27.269 --> 06:55:29.371
A STAKEHOLDER OR SOME OTHER

06:55:29.437 --> 06:55:31.473
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

06:55:31.539 --> 06:55:33.408
IT RIGHT AND AND WORK THAT OUT

06:55:33.475 --> 06:55:35.043
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY DON'T INSTEAD

06:55:35.110 --> 06:55:36.611
OF TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP LIKE --

06:55:36.678 --> 06:55:37.879
WELL NOW THEY ARE FEES OUT WE

06:55:37.946 --> 06:55:39.381
DON'T LIKE THIS WE WANT TO PULL

06:55:39.447 --> 06:55:46.054
BACK OR LIBERAL THAT'S EVEN MORE

06:55:46.121 --> 06:55:46.955
EXPENSIVE.

06:55:47.022 --> 06:55:48.223
AND RIGHT RECOGNIZING THAT ALSO

06:55:48.290 --> 06:55:48.823
THE PURCHASING OF THIS DOESN'T

06:55:48.890 --> 06:55:49.858
ALWAYS FIT NEATLY INTO OUR USUAL

06:55:51.159 --> 06:55:53.061
SO -- SO BUT I DO THINK THERE'S

06:55:53.128 --> 06:55:53.795
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE

06:55:53.862 --> 06:55:55.797
MECHANISM BY WHICH WILL HAVE AS

06:55:55.864 --> 06:55:57.399
WE CAN SAVE YOU KNOW WILL.

06:55:57.465 --> 06:55:59.701
OUT WILL APPEAL BUDGET THE MONEY

06:55:59.768 --> 06:56:01.036
BUT THE MONEY ACTUALLY DOESN'T

06:56:01.102 --> 06:56:03.905
GET RELEASED UNTIL WE THE

06:56:03.972 --> 06:56:06.341
LEGISLATURE HAVE SOME SORT OF A

06:56:06.408 --> 06:56:07.976
THING YOU KNOW THAT THE PROOF

LOOK AT AND SAY YEA OR NAY

06:56:15.750 --> 06:56:17.986
BEFORE IT MOVES ONWARD --

06:56:18.053 --> 06:56:18.453
BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE

06:56:18.520 --> 06:56:19.554
ALTERNATIVE IS LIKE WHICH IS THE

WE DO THIS AND I THIS IS

06:56:25.427 --> 06:56:26.528

07:21:17.717 --> 07:21:18.785
HEARING IS IT'S ACTUALLY THIS IS

07:21:18.852 --> 07:21:20.453
A NEW NEW SYSTEM THAT RIGHT TO

07:21:20.520 --> 07:21:21.855
THE CURRENT BUT WE HAVE TWO

07:21:21.922 --> 07:21:23.056
DISCRETE SYSTEMS THE FILING

07:21:23.123 --> 07:21:24.491
SYSTEM THAT WE ADDRESSED AND THE

07:21:24.558 --> 07:21:25.759
PROVIDER COMPLAINTS SYSTEM BOTH.

07:21:25.826 --> 07:21:27.494
OF THEM OUR LEGACY SYSTEMS VERY

07:21:27.561 --> 07:21:29.095
OLD HAND BUILT AND VERY

07:21:29.162 --> 07:21:30.330
DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN.

07:21:30.397 --> 07:21:33.300
AND SO THE PROPOSAL IS TO

07:21:33.366 --> 07:21:35.068
REPLACE BOTH SYSTEMS WITH --

07:21:35.135 --> 07:21:36.403
ESSENTIALLY THINGS YOU CAN BUY

07:21:36.469 --> 07:21:37.571
OFF THE SHELF THAT CAN BE

07:21:37.637 --> 07:21:40.006
MODIFIED FOR USE AND THEN --

07:21:40.073 --> 07:21:41.808
LEVERAGED AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

07:21:41.875 --> 07:21:42.642
THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY

07:21:42.709 --> 07:21:43.910
SAID FOR MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS

07:21:43.977 --> 07:21:45.512
ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT SO WE ARE

07:21:45.579 --> 07:21:47.147
CURRENTLY IN THIS STAGE TWO

07:21:47.214 --> 07:21:48.248
ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS.

07:21:48.315 --> 07:21:50.984
LOOKING AT A SINGLE PLATFORM TO

07:21:51.051 --> 07:21:55.021
RESOLVE BOASTS A PROP BOTH THE

07:21:55.088 --> 07:21:56.022
TITLE ISSUES OKAY SITS BUT JUST

07:21:56.089 --> 07:21:57.724
TO CLARIFY SINCE THIS IS OFF THE

07:21:57.791 --> 07:22:01.661
BOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING AT OFF

07:22:01.728 --> 07:22:02.929
THE SHELF SOLUTIONS THEN

07:22:02.996 --> 07:22:03.230
[inaudible]

07:22:03.296 --> 07:22:04.664
THE OF TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY

07:22:04.731 --> 07:22:05.298
SIX THOUSAND OF FOR LEASE THIS

07:22:05.365 --> 07:22:07.100
PARTICULAR ITEM -- IN ONE TIME

07:22:07.167 --> 07:22:08.335
CAUGHT CONTRA COSTA UPGRADE THE

07:22:08.401 --> 07:22:12.672
SYSTEM -- SO THIS ISN'T LIKE

07:22:12.739 --> 07:22:14.174
THIS IS JUST THE INTRODUCTORY

07:22:14.241 --> 07:22:15.575
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE AND I

07:22:15.642 --> 07:22:16.910
MEAN I MEAN WE GOT TO SPEND MORE

07:22:16.977 --> 07:22:18.578
MONEY TO BUY THE SYSTEM I GUESS

07:22:18.645 --> 07:22:19.813
I MEAN IS THAT THE FUTURE

07:22:19.880 --> 07:22:20.380
EXPENSE.

07:22:20.447 --> 07:22:22.082

07:22:22.148 --> 07:22:23.650
MAINTENANCE MONEY ON FOR A

07:22:23.717 --> 07:22:24.551

BUYING A NEW SYSTEM AND SO.

07:22:57.117 --> 07:23:00.086

WHERE WEEKS AT THE SELF FROM THE

07:31:35.001 --> 07:31:38.004
STATE MINIMUM WAGE SINCE IT THIS.

07:31:38.070 --> 07:31:39.772

07:31:39.839 --> 07:31:41.307
A LOGICAL QUESTION I WHEN YOU

07:31:41.374 --> 07:31:42.608
LOOK AT THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE

07:31:42.675 --> 07:31:44.343
IT'S REALLY DESIGNED TO CARE FOR

07:31:44.410 --> 07:31:46.279
THINGS SUCH AS FOOD HOUSING

07:31:46.345 --> 07:31:48.080
THOSE SORTS OF COST THAT PEOPLE

07:31:48.147 --> 07:31:49.248
IN HER.

07:31:49.315 --> 07:31:50.483

EXPENSES SO THE STATE MINIMUM

07:32:01.727 --> 07:32:02.662
WAGE WE THINK PROVIDES THE

07:32:02.728 --> 07:32:03.696
APPROPRIATE BALANCING

07:32:03.763 --> 07:32:05.131

WHICH WILL CREATE FUNDING FOR

07:37:51.010 --> 07:37:52.278
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT CAN

07:37:52.344 --> 07:37:54.013

AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER

07:41:13.645 --> 07:41:15.314
QUESTION I WOULD MAKE NOTICES

07:41:15.381 --> 07:41:17.149
THAT YOU EVENTUALLY WHEN YOU GO

07:41:17.216 --> 07:41:19.184
TO SCALE YOU'LL HAVE SIXTEEN

07:41:19.251 --> 07:41:21.320
RESIDENTS FOR EACH YEAR.

07:41:21.387 --> 07:41:23.188
AND THE DATE AND THE INTENTION

07:41:23.255 --> 07:41:24.757
IS IS THAT PER YOU KNOW

07:41:24.823 --> 07:41:25.357
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE IN LINE

07:41:25.424 --> 07:41:27.092
WITH THE R. C. REQUIREMENTS THAT

07:41:27.159 --> 07:41:29.895
THEY WILL BE SPENDING LOVE THEIR

07:41:29.962 --> 07:41:30.195
IN PATIENT.

07:41:30.262 --> 07:41:31.864
TIMED WITH THE STATE HOSPITALS

07:41:31.930 --> 07:41:38.537
CORRECT THAT'S RIGHT.

07:41:38.604 --> 07:41:41.673
OKAY SO I THINK -- THIS IS WHY I

07:41:41.740 --> 07:41:44.443
A CERTAINLY -- YES -- FIRST OF

07:41:44.510 --> 07:41:45.177
ALL I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT

07:41:45.244 --> 07:41:46.378
THAT'S A LOT MAN POWER RIGHT

07:41:46.445 --> 07:41:48.814
THERE -- THAT YEAR ARE YOU DON'T

07:41:48.881 --> 07:41:50.749
WORK FOR OUR AND SUCH AS MINUTES

07:41:50.816 --> 07:41:51.884
MA'AM LIMóN BUT NOW IT'S IT

07:41:51.950 --> 07:41:52.584
THAT'S A LOT OF WORK THERE SO

07:41:52.651 --> 07:41:53.218
THERE'S A BIG SYSTEM WORKFORCE

07:41:53.285 --> 07:41:56.088
FROM THE RESIDENTS THEMSELVES

07:41:56.155 --> 07:41:56.588
BECAUSE THEY CAN PROVIDE

07:41:56.655 --> 07:41:57.389
CLINICAL SERVICES.

07:41:57.456 --> 07:41:58.057
RIGHT UNDER SUPERVISION BUT THEY

07:41:58.123 --> 07:41:59.058
DEFINITELY PROVIDE SO.

07:41:59.124 --> 07:41:59.992
SO IF YOU JUST COUNT THE

07:42:00.059 --> 07:42:00.659
RESIDENTS ALONE BEFORE THEY EVEN

07:42:00.726 --> 07:42:01.960
GRADUATE WHETHER THEY WORK FOR

07:42:02.027 --> 07:42:03.862
YOU ARE NOT -- THAT REPRESENTS A

07:42:03.929 --> 07:42:05.397
CERTAIN LEVEL OF CAPACITY THAT

07:42:05.464 --> 07:42:07.266
YOU'RE BUILDING THERE NOW THEY

07:42:07.332 --> 07:42:08.567
ARE TRAINEES THEY NEED TO BE A

07:42:08.634 --> 07:42:09.868
SUPERVISION BUT I WOULD MAKE

07:42:09.935 --> 07:42:11.303
NOTE RESIDENTS ARE GRADUATES OF

07:42:11.370 --> 07:42:12.971
MEDICAL SCHOOLS THEY ACTUALLY

07:42:13.038 --> 07:42:15.240
END UP HOLDING A LICENSE -- SO

07:42:15.307 --> 07:42:16.375
THEY THEY CAN ACTUALLY BIRD AND

07:42:16.442 --> 07:42:17.676
THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE DIRECT

07:42:17.743 --> 07:42:19.778
CLINICAL SERVICES SO CERTAINLY I

07:42:19.845 --> 07:42:20.746
THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

07:42:20.813 --> 07:42:22.548
SUCCESS LEVEL THIS ONE HAS TO

07:42:22.614 --> 07:42:23.782
RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE REBUILDING

07:42:23.849 --> 07:42:25.717
CAPACITY IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET

07:42:25.784 --> 07:42:28.087
THE PROGRAM ACCREDITED -- YOU

07:42:28.153 --> 07:42:29.455
KNOW I I ALSO THINK THAT.

07:42:29.521 --> 07:42:30.722
CERTAINLY WHILE YOUR GOALS IS TO

07:42:30.789 --> 07:42:33.192
GET MORE STAFF PSYCHIATRISTS --

07:42:33.258 --> 07:42:34.827
AND I AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

07:42:34.893 --> 07:42:37.062
MAY COME UP THEIR TRADITIONS THE

07:42:37.129 --> 07:42:37.629
YOU DO NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH

07:42:37.696 --> 07:42:38.964
PSYCHIATRISTS ONSITE SUPERVISE

07:42:39.031 --> 07:42:45.604
ALL THE RESIDENTS -- BUT EIGHT I

07:42:45.671 --> 07:42:46.738
GUESS I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE

07:42:46.805 --> 07:42:48.006
THAT YOU GET MORE I MEAN I THE

07:42:48.073 --> 07:42:48.874
IS THE EXPECTATION WOULD BE IS

07:42:48.941 --> 07:42:50.109
LIKE ALL WELL EVERYBODY

07:42:50.175 --> 07:42:51.276
GRADUATES GONNA END UP SIGNING

07:42:51.343 --> 07:42:52.144
UP FOR STATE SERVICE I THINK

07:42:52.211 --> 07:42:53.245
THAT WOULD BE AN UNREASONABLE

07:42:53.312 --> 07:42:55.747
EXPECTATION BUT HOPEFULLY THAT

07:42:55.814 --> 07:42:57.015
EXPOSURE.

07:42:57.082 --> 07:42:59.051
WILL -- GET THE HELP YOU THE

07:42:59.118 --> 07:43:00.152
OTHER THING THAT YOU MIGHT ALSO

07:43:00.219 --> 07:43:03.222
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS IS THAT --

07:43:03.288 --> 07:43:03.922
COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER

07:43:03.989 --> 07:43:05.224
RESIDENTS IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN

07:43:05.290 --> 07:43:06.258
RESIDENCY PROGRAM YOU PRIDE

07:43:06.325 --> 07:43:07.226
THEIR POSITION TO THINK ABOUT

07:43:07.292 --> 07:43:08.360
COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER

07:43:08.427 --> 07:43:09.928
PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS

07:43:09.995 --> 07:43:12.164
OF PEOPLE ME WHY DO ROTATIONS TO

07:43:12.231 --> 07:43:13.832
LEARN OF OUR ABOUT THAT SO ONCE

07:43:13.899 --> 07:43:15.067
YOU HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP

07:43:15.134 --> 07:43:16.168
IT'S A LOT HARDER DO IT IF YOU.

07:43:16.235 --> 07:43:17.569
DON'T BUT IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN

07:43:17.636 --> 07:43:18.637
RESIDENT RATE OF YOUR OWN

07:43:18.704 --> 07:43:19.905
INFRASTRUCTURE.

07:43:19.972 --> 07:43:21.540
SO YOU MAY EVEN SOME OF THE

07:43:21.607 --> 07:43:23.041
RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WHERE THEY

07:43:23.108 --> 07:43:25.077
MAY SPEND DOWN TIME OVER AT

07:43:25.144 --> 07:43:26.745
STATE HOSPITALS VICE VERSA YEAR

07:43:26.812 --> 07:43:28.080

THEIR HOUSE YOU KNOW TO TO LEARN

07:43:32.718 --> 07:43:33.285
MORE ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF THINGS

07:43:33.352 --> 07:43:34.553
BUT THAT.

07:43:34.620 --> 07:43:35.354
HOPEFULLY THAT TREATS MORE

07:43:35.420 --> 07:43:36.221
EXPOSURE ALSO CREATES AN

07:43:36.288 --> 07:43:37.122
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO RECRUIT --

07:43:37.189 --> 07:43:38.090
MORE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE A MORE

07:43:38.157 --> 07:43:39.591
FAMILIARITY IS WITH THE NATURE

07:43:39.658 --> 07:43:41.860
OF THE WORK -- AT THAT STATE

07:43:41.927 --> 07:43:45.464
HOSPITAL SO -- ON A PRE SHEET LA

07:43:45.531 --> 07:43:48.667
AS PERSPECTIVE ON THE FUNDING

07:43:48.734 --> 07:43:52.070
BUT I A ESTIMATE AS A EDUCATION

07:43:52.137 --> 07:43:53.272

YOUR COMMITMENT EVERY TIME YOU

07:43:58.610 --> 07:44:00.679
MIDDLE CLASS OKAY BECAUSE YOU

07:44:00.746 --> 07:44:02.214
YOU CAN TRAIN PEOPLE IN THE

07:44:02.281 --> 07:44:03.615
MIDDLE AND ACTUALLY THAT'S GOING

07:44:03.682 --> 07:44:05.217
TO BE A FACTOR AND ACCREDITATION

07:44:05.284 --> 07:44:06.418
DECISION.

07:44:06.485 --> 07:44:07.519
TO THEIR ESSAYS ARE GOING TO BE

07:44:07.586 --> 07:44:10.155
SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING.

07:44:10.222 --> 07:44:12.224
AND OUR COMMITMENT I SHOULD SAY

07:44:12.291 --> 07:44:14.193

AND CERTAINLY IF IT TURNS OUT

07:44:17.262 --> 07:44:18.730
THIS IS QUOTE NOT SUCCESSFUL YOU

07:44:18.797 --> 07:44:21.967

PEOPLE STRANDED -- AND SO.

07:44:28.073 --> 07:44:30.409
A SO I THINK THE MAIN ISSUE IS

07:44:30.475 --> 07:44:34.479
GOING TO BE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW

07:44:34.546 --> 07:44:36.048

MANAGING IS A PEER REVIEW IS

07:52:09.534 --> 07:52:10.769
THAT THE WOULD HAVE A TREATING A

07:52:10.835 --> 07:52:12.203
CLINICIAN BOTH SERVING THEIR OWN

07:52:12.270 --> 07:52:13.972
PATIENTS AND THEN ALSO SORT OF

07:52:14.039 --> 07:52:14.606
DOING THESE FRIENDS OF

07:52:14.673 --> 07:52:17.208
VALUATIONS OF OTHER --

07:52:17.275 --> 07:52:23.114
CLINICIANS PATIENTS -- BASICALLY

07:52:23.181 --> 07:52:24.582
AT IT WITHIN THE CURRENT THE WAY

07:52:24.649 --> 07:52:25.216
CURRENTLY CURRENTLY THAT WOULD

07:52:25.283 --> 07:52:25.717
WORK THAT WOULD MEAN WE

07:52:25.784 --> 07:52:26.818
BASICALLY NEED ADDITIONAL

07:52:26.885 --> 07:52:27.419
PSYCHIATRISTS IN ORDER TO DO

07:52:27.485 --> 07:52:28.119
THAT RIGHT TO HAVE A TREATING

07:52:28.186 --> 07:52:29.888
CLINICIAN PSYCHIATRIST AND THEN

07:52:29.954 --> 07:52:30.822
THAT PSYCHIATRISTS LITTLE

07:52:30.889 --> 07:52:31.990
SWEETNESS FRIENDS CASE LORD.

07:52:32.057 --> 07:52:33.224
CASELOAD I THINK ELLIE --

07:52:33.291 --> 07:52:34.559
RECOGNIZES THAT WE WOULD NEED

07:52:34.626 --> 07:52:36.127
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR THAT

07:52:36.194 --> 07:52:37.262
BECAUSE STATE HOUSE WAS NEVER

07:52:37.328 --> 07:52:39.064
REALLY BEEN STOPPED FOR THIS

07:52:39.130 --> 07:52:40.699
FORENSIC THIS THIS GREAT OF OUR

07:52:40.765 --> 07:52:42.867
FRIENDS A CASELOAD -- WE JUST

07:52:42.934 --> 07:52:44.335
KNOW THAT PSYCHIATRISTS ARE VERY

07:52:44.402 --> 07:52:46.771
DIFFICULT TO GET ON THE AND

07:52:46.838 --> 07:52:48.440
FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGISTS.

07:52:48.506 --> 07:52:50.208
ARE US SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER TO

07:52:50.275 --> 07:52:52.844
SORTOF HIGHER -- AND SO WE WE

07:52:52.911 --> 07:52:53.912
THINK OUR PROPOSAL WOULD SORT OF

07:52:53.978 --> 07:52:55.413
MEET THIS NEED -- MUCH MORE

07:52:55.480 --> 07:52:57.382
EFFICIENTLY AND CHEAPER I MIGHT

07:52:57.449 --> 07:52:59.951
ADD -- ON THE CASE MANAGEMENT

07:53:00.018 --> 07:53:01.853
PIECE ON THE WAY THERE ARE

07:53:01.920 --> 07:53:03.722
EXISTING STAFF WITH THE AND

07:53:03.788 --> 07:53:04.756
STATE HOSPITALS ARE DOING SOME

07:53:04.823 --> 07:53:05.924
OF THIS FRIENDS SIX OR THE

07:53:05.990 --> 07:53:07.358
MINISTRY OF CASE MANAGEMENT

07:53:07.425 --> 07:53:08.860
WORKLOAD AND WE DID ACCOUNT FOR

07:53:08.927 --> 07:53:10.295
ALL OF THOSE EXISTING STOP IN

07:53:10.361 --> 07:53:14.165
OUR PROPOSAL -- THIS OULD BE

07:53:14.232 --> 07:53:15.800
ACCOUNTING -- FOR TIMES WHEN

07:53:15.867 --> 07:53:17.035
THERE ISN'T DEDICATED STAFF TO

07:53:17.102 --> 07:53:18.236
FRIENDS WORKLOAD IT'S KIND OF

07:53:18.303 --> 07:53:19.237
BEING DIGGING UP AMONGST THE

07:53:19.304 --> 07:53:20.872
POSITIONS OR ADMINISTRATIVE

07:53:20.939 --> 07:53:22.273
STUFF THAT HAD OTHER DUTIES.

07:53:22.340 --> 07:53:25.043
SO WE REALLY DID -- PLACE THESE

07:53:25.110 --> 07:53:25.543
SORT OF CASE MANAGEMENT

07:53:25.610 --> 07:53:27.245
ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE WHERE WE

07:53:27.312 --> 07:53:28.480
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE EXISTING

07:53:28.546 --> 07:53:30.482
RESOURCES I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

07:53:30.548 --> 07:53:32.250
THIS IS ALL THIS REPORTING TO

07:53:32.317 --> 07:53:33.585
THE COURT AND ALL THE TRACKING A

07:53:33.651 --> 07:53:35.286
HOUSE TO BE DONE IT'S NOT

07:53:35.353 --> 07:53:37.055
OPTIONAL -- AND TO THE EXTENT

07:53:37.122 --> 07:53:38.389
THAT YOU HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE

07:53:38.456 --> 07:53:39.491
POSITIONS DOING IT IT'S MUCH

07:53:39.557 --> 07:53:45.997
CHEAPER THAN HAVING CLINICIANS

07:53:46.064 --> 07:53:47.966
DO IT -- AND ON THEN NEURO PSYCH

07:53:48.032 --> 07:53:49.067
ON THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY

07:53:49.134 --> 07:53:50.368
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT --

07:53:50.435 --> 07:53:50.935
APPROACHING THIS ON A PILOT

07:53:51.002 --> 07:53:53.505
BASIS.

07:53:53.571 --> 07:53:55.073
SO I ACTUALLY ANY FURTHER OF

07:53:55.140 --> 07:53:58.009
COLOR FELLOW FROM WHAT FINANCE

07:53:58.076 --> 07:53:58.843
SAID.

07:53:58.910 --> 07:53:59.744
THE ONLY THE ONLY THING I WOULD

07:53:59.811 --> 07:54:01.212
SAY IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT

07:54:01.279 --> 07:54:03.681
RELIC WHICH APPROACH WOULD BE

07:54:03.748 --> 07:54:05.016
MORE OR LESS COSTLY THINK THAT'S

07:54:05.083 --> 07:54:07.218
PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

07:54:07.285 --> 07:54:09.320
FIGURE OUT IN THE PILOT --

07:54:09.387 --> 07:54:10.789
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE

07:54:10.855 --> 07:54:12.624
PSYCHIATRISTS CARRYING OUT THIS

07:54:12.690 --> 07:54:14.592
WORKLOAD WE JUST HAVE THEM CARRY

07:54:14.659 --> 07:54:16.060
OUT THIS WORK LOAD.

07:54:16.127 --> 07:54:17.529
FOR OTHER PSYCHIATRISTS PATIENTS

07:54:17.595 --> 07:54:19.063
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT COULD

07:54:19.130 --> 07:54:22.433
CREATE A SITUATION WHERE -- IT

07:54:22.500 --> 07:54:23.268
REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF

07:54:23.334 --> 07:54:25.069
ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD SO THERE MAY

07:54:25.136 --> 07:54:27.005
BE ON THE MARGINS THE NEED FOR

07:54:27.071 --> 07:54:28.673
ADDITIONAL PSYCHIATRIST BUT IT'S

07:54:28.740 --> 07:54:29.908
NOT CLEAR TO US THAT THAT WOULD

07:54:29.974 --> 07:54:31.409
BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE

07:54:31.476 --> 07:54:33.912
PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE RECOMMENDING.

07:54:33.978 --> 07:54:36.314
OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE

07:54:36.381 --> 07:54:39.184
CURRENTLY I MEAN THE RECOGNIZE

07:54:39.250 --> 07:54:39.884
THAT.

07:54:39.951 --> 07:54:41.085
THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE

07:54:41.152 --> 07:54:43.254
SITUATION IS IS THAT

07:54:43.321 --> 07:54:46.825
PSYCHIATRISTS ARE BOTH TAKING

07:54:46.891 --> 07:54:47.592
CARE OF THEIR PATIENTS

07:54:47.659 --> 07:54:47.892
[inaudible]

07:54:47.959 --> 07:54:48.660
IN.

07:54:48.726 --> 07:54:50.428
REVIEWING THE CASES RIGHT AND

07:54:50.495 --> 07:54:50.962
YOU'RE SAYING WE NEED TO

07:54:51.029 --> 07:54:52.363
SEPARATE THE TWO AND THAT MAKES

07:54:52.430 --> 07:54:55.900
SENSE BUT IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD.

07:54:55.967 --> 07:55:00.104
THEIR RATE DOING BOTH SO.

07:55:00.171 --> 07:55:02.774
THAT'S ENTREES SO SO I MEAN IT'S

07:55:02.841 --> 07:55:04.742
GREAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

07:55:04.809 --> 07:55:05.877
NO SO I AM LOOKING AT THIS AND

07:55:05.944 --> 07:55:07.245
SAYING THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA

07:55:07.312 --> 07:55:09.547
PEOPLE INVOLVED.

07:55:09.614 --> 07:55:11.182
AND NOT SAYING THAT DOWN AND THE

07:55:11.249 --> 07:55:14.886
THAT IS SO FROM A WORKLOAD

07:55:14.953 --> 07:55:15.820
STANDPOINT.

07:55:15.887 --> 07:55:17.989
THEN WE TAKE OFF THE PART THAT

07:55:18.056 --> 07:55:18.723
THEY'RE REVIEWING AROUND

07:55:18.790 --> 07:55:19.490
PATIENTS THAN EITHER THEY CAN

07:55:19.557 --> 07:55:20.925
SEE MORE PATIENTS WITH THAT

07:55:20.992 --> 07:55:23.194
EXTRA TIME OR THEY CAN REVIEW

07:55:23.261 --> 07:55:28.233
SOMEONE ELSE'S THE CELL OR I

07:55:28.299 --> 07:55:28.800
GUESS THAT'S ARE TRYING TO

07:55:28.867 --> 07:55:29.868
FIGURE OUT HERE ARE YOU SAYING

07:55:29.934 --> 07:55:30.668
THAT WELL ACTUALLY WE ARE SO

07:55:30.735 --> 07:55:31.236
SHORT.

07:55:31.302 --> 07:55:32.804
THEY'LL HAVE PLENTY OF EXTRA

07:55:32.871 --> 07:55:33.938
PATIENTS TO SEE AN OWNERSHIP

07:55:34.005 --> 07:55:35.707
THIS TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

07:55:35.773 --> 07:55:36.674
I MEAN AT THE ESSENTIALLY YES I

07:55:36.741 --> 07:55:38.309
MEAN WITH PSYCHIATRISTS ARE ARE

07:55:38.376 --> 07:55:39.510
READY IS SORT OF COVERING MORE

07:55:39.577 --> 07:55:41.346
THAN ONE UNIT WHERE IDEALLY WE'D

07:55:41.412 --> 07:55:42.847
LIKE TO HAVE A PSYCHIATRIST PER

07:55:42.914 --> 07:55:44.282
UNIT AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY'RE

07:55:44.349 --> 07:55:46.417
DOING THIS FORENSIC -- CASELOAD

07:55:46.484 --> 07:55:47.852
WHICH SOMETIMES REQUIRES THEM TO

07:55:47.919 --> 07:55:49.621
ACTUALLY GO TO COURT AND TESTIFY

07:55:49.687 --> 07:55:51.155
IN COURT WHICH THEN PULLS ME

07:55:51.222 --> 07:55:52.257
AWAY FROM THE FLORIDA THOSE

07:55:52.323 --> 07:55:54.025
THOSE CELLS LIKE ACTUALLY YOUR

07:55:54.092 --> 07:55:54.859
SOLUTION IS.

07:55:54.926 --> 07:55:58.529
TO REMOVE THE PSYCHIATRISTS FROM

07:55:58.596 --> 07:55:59.430
THE COURT YEAH HE'S.

07:55:59.497 --> 07:56:00.098
A PSYCHIATRIST TO DO THE

07:56:00.164 --> 07:56:01.933
TREATMENT PART OF THEIR JOB AND

07:56:02.000 --> 07:56:03.835
BE ABLE TO DO IT BETTER AND MORE.

07:56:03.902 --> 07:56:05.136
SORT OF MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF

07:56:05.203 --> 07:56:06.905
THE PSYCHIATRISTS THAT WE DO

07:56:06.971 --> 07:56:09.440
HAPPENS REFUSAL LATELY JUST OKAY

07:56:09.507 --> 07:56:10.508
YES FINANCE NO I WOULD JUST

07:56:10.575 --> 07:56:11.109
ADDING CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

07:56:11.175 --> 07:56:17.982
HERE BUT I BELIEVE THESE --

07:56:18.049 --> 07:56:18.816
CLINICIANS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

07:56:18.883 --> 07:56:19.417
WRITING THE REPRTS AND THEN

07:56:19.484 --> 07:56:20.618
GOING TO COURT AND TESTIFYING.

07:56:20.685 --> 07:56:21.686
ON THOSE PATIENTS AS WELL AND SO

07:56:21.753 --> 07:56:22.053
THERE'S LIKE.

07:56:22.120 --> 07:56:23.221
I THINK THAT I I NEED TO BE A

07:56:23.288 --> 07:56:24.222
DIVIDE OF THAT CONFLICT OF

07:56:24.289 --> 07:56:26.791
INTEREST OF THEM RIGHT IN THE

07:56:26.858 --> 07:56:28.092
REPORTS I THINK.

07:56:28.159 --> 07:56:30.161
DR WARBURTON PRICE BECAUSE UPON

07:56:30.228 --> 07:56:31.562
A LITTLE BETTER THAN I JUST SOME

07:56:31.629 --> 07:56:32.730
GENERAL POINTS ABOUT FRIENDS

07:56:32.797 --> 07:56:35.500
LIKE A VALUATIONS THESE ARE --

07:56:35.566 --> 07:56:37.268
ASSESSMENTS EVALUATIONS

07:56:37.335 --> 07:56:38.770
REPORTING AND TESTIMONY WHICH

07:56:38.836 --> 07:56:40.104
ARE ALL SKILLS AND ABILITIES

07:56:40.171 --> 07:56:41.506
THAT ARE NOT TAUGHT IN ANY

07:56:41.572 --> 07:56:43.708
GENERAL RESIDENCY OR PSYCHOLOGY

07:56:43.775 --> 07:56:48.313
TRAINING PROGRAM -- IT REQUIRES

07:56:48.379 --> 07:56:49.514
A LOT OF POST.

07:56:49.580 --> 07:56:50.782
GENERAL TRAINING -- EITHER IN A

07:56:50.848 --> 07:56:53.184
FELLOWSHIP OR IN A POST DOC OF

07:56:53.251 --> 07:56:55.653
FRIENDS A POSTDOC EXPERIENCE SO

07:56:55.720 --> 07:56:57.455
IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES OF

07:56:57.522 --> 07:56:58.589
DUAL AGENCY.

07:56:58.656 --> 07:57:00.124
WHERE THE LITERATURES CLEAR THAT

07:57:00.191 --> 07:57:01.459
IF YOU HAVE A PATIENT THAT

07:57:01.526 --> 07:57:02.593
YOU'RE TREATING?

07:57:02.660 --> 07:57:03.728
AND YOUR DUTY IS TO THAT

07:57:03.795 --> 07:57:05.797
PATIENTS -- THERE'S A CONFLICT

07:57:05.863 --> 07:57:07.398
IF YOU'RE ALSO DOING FRIENDS

07:57:07.465 --> 07:57:09.067
EVALUATION WHICH YOUR DUTY IS TO

07:57:09.133 --> 07:57:10.702
THE COURT -- SO YOU HAVE JUST

07:57:10.768 --> 07:57:12.637
NOT JUST THE DUAL AGENCY ISSUE

07:57:12.704 --> 07:57:14.305
WHICH I'M NOT SURE WOULD BE

07:57:14.372 --> 07:57:16.441
RESOLVED BY THE LA -- SUGGESTION

07:57:16.507 --> 07:57:17.809
BECAUSE OUR PATIENT MOVEMENT IS

07:57:17.875 --> 07:57:19.711
SO COMPLEX NUMBER DEDUCTIBLE

07:57:19.777 --> 07:57:21.012
THERE'S NO SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE

07:57:21.079 --> 07:57:22.347
THE EVALUATOR TODAY WON'T BE THE

07:57:22.413 --> 07:57:23.681
TRIGGER TOMORROW.

07:57:23.748 --> 07:57:25.316
BUT THERE ARE THE ADDITIONAL IT --

07:57:25.383 --> 07:57:27.018
ISSUES OF A LACK OF TRAINING --

07:57:27.085 --> 07:57:28.519
THAT ARE A GENERAL PSYCHIATRIST

07:57:28.586 --> 07:57:30.521
OR PSYCHOLOGIST HAS AS WELL AS

07:57:30.588 --> 07:57:33.324
JUST SKILLS AND ABILITIES -- NOT

07:57:33.391 --> 07:57:35.159
EVERYONE WHO ON THOSE INTO

07:57:35.226 --> 07:57:36.127
MEDICINE IS GOOD AT DOING

07:57:36.194 --> 07:57:37.528
FORENSIC VALUATIONS WRITING

07:57:37.595 --> 07:57:42.533
REPORTS AND TESTIFYING IN WE HAD

07:57:42.600 --> 07:57:43.067
HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THAT

07:57:43.134 --> 07:57:43.368
[inaudible]

07:57:43.434 --> 07:57:43.735
OKAY [inaudible]

07:57:43.801 --> 07:57:45.737
SO.

07:57:45.803 --> 07:57:46.804
SO WHY YOU USE USES A

07:57:46.871 --> 07:57:48.306
PSYCHIATRIST THEMSELVES TO

07:57:48.373 --> 07:57:48.906
SHOULD BE DOING ON THERE ARE

07:57:48.973 --> 07:57:50.241
PATIENTS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB AT

07:57:50.308 --> 07:57:51.876
IT.

07:57:51.943 --> 07:57:53.378
IT WAS. TO A GENERAL SURGEON

07:57:53.444 --> 07:57:54.445
DOING HER TRANSPLANT IT'S JUST

07:57:54.512 --> 07:57:55.546
SOMETHING YOU HAVE SOME

07:57:55.613 --> 07:57:56.781
FOUNDATIONAL TRAINING FOR BUT

07:57:56.848 --> 07:57:58.649
YOU DON'T HAVE THE ADDITIONAL

07:57:58.716 --> 07:57:59.517
SUBSPECIALTY TRAINING

07:57:59.584 --> 07:57:59.817
[inaudible]

07:57:59.884 --> 07:58:01.686
OKAY.

07:58:01.753 --> 07:58:03.321
SO I GUESS WHAT'S HELPFUL IS TO

07:58:03.388 --> 07:58:04.856
GET A BETTER SENSE OF REALLY

07:58:04.922 --> 07:58:07.358
WHAT IS THE SONG I KNOW YOU WENT

07:58:07.425 --> 07:58:08.793
THROUGH THIS TO TO THE BETTER

07:58:08.860 --> 07:58:10.762
SENSE OF THE WERE THE EXACTLY

07:58:10.828 --> 07:58:12.463
WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD SO WHAT.

07:58:12.530 --> 07:58:14.332
I'M HEARING NOW AND I DON'T KNOW

07:58:14.399 --> 07:58:15.566
WHETHER YOU GOT THE INFORMATION

07:58:15.633 --> 07:58:16.667
FROM THE ALEJO'S IS THAT WHAT

07:58:16.734 --> 07:58:17.869
YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING

07:58:17.935 --> 07:58:20.905
IS SAYING OKAY WE WANT TO TAKE

07:58:20.972 --> 07:58:21.939
THE PSYCHIATRISTS.

07:58:22.006 --> 07:58:23.674
HAVING JUST FOCUS ON PATIENT

07:58:23.741 --> 07:58:24.809
CARE RGHT.

07:58:24.876 --> 07:58:26.811
RIGHT AND THEN BECAUSE WE DON'T

07:58:26.878 --> 07:58:28.513
HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM SELL WOODS

07:58:28.579 --> 07:58:30.148
SO WHY SHOULD WE OWE IT WILL

07:58:30.214 --> 07:58:31.649
EXPAND OUR WORK FORCE WE WENT TO

07:58:31.716 --> 07:58:33.117
BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS HAVE AND

07:58:33.184 --> 07:58:33.751
JUST FOCUS ON THE PATIENT CARE

07:58:33.818 --> 07:58:34.385
PIECE.

07:58:34.452 --> 07:58:35.586
AND THEN THIS FORENSIC

07:58:35.653 --> 07:58:38.122
EVALUATION PIECE WE'RE GOING TO

07:58:38.189 --> 07:58:39.023
BRING IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF

07:58:39.090 --> 07:58:39.991
FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGISTS NEW

07:58:40.058 --> 07:58:41.059
PEOPLE.

07:58:41.125 --> 07:58:41.893
AND HAVE THEM JUST DO THAT PARTS

07:58:41.959 --> 07:58:43.995
WERE SIR BIFURCATING THE JOB

07:58:44.062 --> 07:58:45.396
HERERIGHT AND TELLS THE

07:58:45.463 --> 07:58:46.497
CHARACTERS TO THE PSYCHIATRY

07:58:46.564 --> 07:58:48.099
PART AND HAVE THE FORENSIC

07:58:48.166 --> 07:58:50.868
PSYCHOLOGIST TO THE FORENSIC

07:58:50.935 --> 07:58:51.235
PIECE AND THEN.

07:58:51.302 --> 07:58:52.537
YEAH.

07:58:52.603 --> 07:58:54.038
SO YES SO ESSENTIALLY UNDER THE

07:58:54.105 --> 07:58:55.807
LA -- APPROACH TO THIS -- WE'D

07:58:55.873 --> 07:58:56.541
BE A LOT.

07:58:56.607 --> 07:58:59.043
CLOSER TO OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THE

07:58:59.110 --> 07:59:00.611
ONLY BIG CHANGES THAT.

07:59:00.678 --> 07:59:01.979
CLINICIANS WOULD DO THAT

07:59:02.046 --> 07:59:04.182
WORKLOAD FOR OTHER CLINICIANS

07:59:04.248 --> 07:59:05.683
PATIENTS RATHER THAN THEIR OWN

07:59:05.750 --> 07:59:07.752
SO WELL LET ME JUST POSE THE

07:59:07.819 --> 07:59:08.986
QUESTION I MEAN.

07:59:09.053 --> 07:59:09.887
SO THE THE OTHER BIG DIFFERENCE

07:59:09.954 --> 07:59:11.823
BETWEEN THE TWO IS IS THAT

07:59:11.889 --> 07:59:14.192
ACTUALLY THE THE PARTS THEY

07:59:14.258 --> 07:59:15.793
HOSPITALS ARGUING THAT.

07:59:15.860 --> 07:59:16.694
THE CURRENT WORKFORCE ISN'T

07:59:16.761 --> 07:59:18.296
SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO START WITH

07:59:18.362 --> 07:59:19.430
RIGHT SO WE'RE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

07:59:19.497 --> 07:59:20.832
ADDING PEOPLE RIGHT AND THEY SAY

07:59:20.898 --> 07:59:22.266
THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING IS

07:59:22.333 --> 07:59:23.901
THAT FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGISTS

07:59:23.968 --> 07:59:24.769
VERSUS.

07:59:24.836 --> 07:59:26.704
GETTING MORE PSYCHIATRISTS SAID

07:59:26.771 --> 07:59:27.438
THAT THAT.

07:59:27.505 --> 07:59:29.040
I MEAN IS THAT IT DID WAS THAT

07:59:29.107 --> 07:59:30.174
SOMETHING YOU LOOKED AT IN TERMS

07:59:30.241 --> 07:59:31.609
OF SO I AGREE THAT YOU'RE

07:59:31.676 --> 07:59:33.411
PROCESSING THAT ACTUALLY LEAVES

07:59:33.478 --> 07:59:34.579
THE WORK FORCE ABOUT THE SAME

07:59:34.645 --> 07:59:36.013
THEY'RE SAYING ACTUALLY ONE

07:59:36.080 --> 07:59:38.082
EXPAND THE WORK FORCE -- AND AND

07:59:38.149 --> 07:59:39.350
THIS IS OUR APPROACH TO DO IT

07:59:39.417 --> 07:59:41.185
RIGHT RIGHT AND SO UNDER OUR

07:59:41.252 --> 07:59:42.787
APPROACH WE WOULDN'T EXPAND THE

07:59:42.854 --> 07:59:44.455
THE WORK FORCE AT LEAST NOT AT

07:59:44.522 --> 07:59:45.790
THE TO THE EXTREME EXTEND IT

07:59:45.857 --> 07:59:47.792
COULD BE THAT YOU NEED A FEW

07:59:47.859 --> 07:59:50.728
ADDITIONAL TANK TO HANDLE IT --

07:59:50.795 --> 07:59:52.130
BUT THAT BUT ESSENTIALLY -- WE

07:59:52.196 --> 07:59:53.698
DIDN'T FEEL THAT WE WERE

07:59:53.764 --> 07:59:55.333
PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT DATA TO

07:59:55.399 --> 07:59:57.335
SHOW THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR

07:59:57.401 --> 07:59:59.103
ADDITIONAL PSYCHIATRISTS THAT

07:59:59.170 --> 08:00:00.872
THE CURRENT PSYCHIATRISTS ARE

08:00:00.938 --> 08:00:02.106
ARE INSUFFICIENT.

08:00:02.173 --> 08:00:03.241
AND NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU DID DO

08:00:03.307 --> 08:00:04.742
A WHOLE BIG STUDY RIGHT YEAH WE

08:00:04.809 --> 08:00:06.744
DID DO A WHOLE BIG STUDY -- AND

08:00:06.811 --> 08:00:08.212
I DON'T REALLY STATE HOSPITALS

08:00:08.279 --> 08:00:09.714
THAT DID A LOT OF GROUNDWORK

08:00:09.780 --> 08:00:10.815
BEFORE WE EVEN GOT THERE RIGHT

08:00:10.882 --> 08:00:13.284
SO WHAT THEY DID -- A LOT OF ON

08:00:13.351 --> 08:00:15.286
ACTUAL SORT OF IN DEPTH ANALYSIS

08:00:15.353 --> 08:00:16.387
OF WHAT ACTUALLY THE FORENSIC

08:00:16.454 --> 08:00:18.189
WORKLOAD IS AND WE HAVE TONS AND

08:00:18.256 --> 08:00:20.358
TONS OF METRIC SAYING EXACTLY

08:00:20.424 --> 08:00:21.559
HOW MUCH TIME YOU SHARE THAT

08:00:21.626 --> 08:00:22.827
WITH LA -- THEN TO THE WOULD

08:00:22.894 --> 08:00:24.929
HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT'S THE

08:00:24.996 --> 08:00:29.901
IT'S INCLUDED AS ATTACHMENTS TO

08:00:29.967 --> 08:00:31.302
THE B. C. B. SO [inaudible]

08:00:31.369 --> 08:00:31.669
OKAY [inaudible]

08:00:31.736 --> 08:00:33.004
YES.

08:00:33.070 --> 08:00:33.371
YEAH.

08:00:33.437 --> 08:00:34.238
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING

08:00:34.305 --> 08:00:34.939
FOR IS WHAT ADDITIONAL --

08:00:35.006 --> 08:00:35.840
BENEFIT COULD WE EXPECT FROM

08:00:35.907 --> 08:00:36.874
CLINICIANS BEING ABLE TO

08:00:36.941 --> 08:00:38.276
DEDICATE MORE TIME TO THEIR

08:00:38.342 --> 08:00:39.777
PATIENTS WOULD WE SEE LINK TO

08:00:39.844 --> 08:00:41.846
STAY GO DOWN WHAT WE SEE

08:00:41.913 --> 08:00:43.114
TREATMENT IMPROVE.

08:00:43.181 --> 08:00:45.016
AND THAT WAS THE SORT OF THING

08:00:45.082 --> 08:00:46.984
THAT WE'RE FOR A SO MAYBE WE CAN

08:00:47.051 --> 08:00:48.452
HAVE SOME COMMUNICATIONS DECLARE

08:00:48.519 --> 08:00:50.621
FITTED TO TO CLARIFY THE

08:00:50.688 --> 08:00:51.923

FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE THINK A

08:07:04.495 --> 08:07:06.130
LOT OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE

08:07:06.196 --> 08:07:08.032

08:07:08.098 --> 08:07:09.700
A WAY TO BRING A LOT OF GREAT

08:07:09.767 --> 08:07:11.435
GREATER DEAL TRANSPARENCY TO THE

AND THE FIFTY ADMINISTRATIVE

08:07:23.847 --> 08:07:25.215
STAFF TO REDUCE THE

08:07:25.282 --> 08:07:27.318
ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD THAT'S

08:07:27.384 --> 08:07:28.619
CURRENTLY CARRIED OUT BY NURSES.

08:07:28.686 --> 08:07:30.721
HOWEVER WE ARE SOMEWHAT -- WE

08:07:30.788 --> 08:07:32.623
WOULD NOTE THAT THE CURRENT

08:07:32.690 --> 08:07:33.524
STAFF THEY OR THEIR STAFFING

08:07:33.591 --> 08:07:35.225
RATIOS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED

08:07:35.292 --> 08:07:36.560
ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT

08:07:36.627 --> 08:07:38.562
PRACTICE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN

08:07:38.629 --> 08:07:40.698
EVALUATED DETERMINE WHETHER OR

08:07:40.764 --> 08:07:41.899
NOT IT'S OPTIMAL.

08:07:41.966 --> 08:07:43.901
AND IN FACT THE UNIVERSITY OF

08:07:43.968 --> 08:07:45.402
CALIFORNIA IRVINE RESEARCHERS

08:07:45.469 --> 08:07:46.770
THAT WERE USED TO VALIDATE THE

08:07:46.837 --> 08:07:48.405
STUDY NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE

08:07:48.472 --> 08:07:49.873
IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO

08:07:49.940 --> 08:07:51.408
REVIEW STAFFING IN THE FUTURE TO

08:07:51.475 --> 08:07:53.544
ENSURE THAT IT IS OPTIMAL.

08:07:53.611 --> 08:07:55.279
ARM AND SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING

08:07:55.346 --> 08:07:56.814
THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALSO

08:07:56.880 --> 08:07:57.982
DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT TO

08:07:58.048 --> 08:08:00.117
CONTRACT WITH AN INDEPENDENT

08:08:00.184 --> 08:08:02.720
CONSULTANT. TO ASSESS WHETHER OR

08:08:02.786 --> 08:08:04.321
NOT THE STAFFING BOTH FOR NURSES

08:08:04.388 --> 08:08:06.223
AND FOR THE PART MORE GENERALLY

08:08:06.290 --> 08:08:08.692
IS -- OPTIMAL AND TO REQUIRE THE

08:08:08.759 --> 08:08:09.793
DEPARTMENT TO THE REPORT THE

08:08:09.860 --> 08:08:11.328
READER THE RESULTS OF THAT

08:08:11.395 --> 08:08:12.329
ANALYSIS.

08:08:12.396 --> 08:08:13.964
WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED

08:08:14.031 --> 08:08:15.299
DEDICATED STAFFING FOR

08:08:15.366 --> 08:08:17.234
MEDICATION ROOMS WERE

08:08:17.301 --> 08:08:20.638
RECOMMENDING -- THAT INSTEAD OF

08:08:20.704 --> 08:08:21.939
IMPLEMENTING THIS ON ON ACROSS

08:08:22.006 --> 08:08:23.874
ALL FIVE HOSPITALS THAT WE DO IT

08:08:23.941 --> 08:08:25.409
ON A PILOT BASIS BECAUSE IT

08:08:25.476 --> 08:08:26.977
REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL

08:08:27.044 --> 08:08:28.145
INVESTMENT.

08:08:28.212 --> 08:08:30.047
AND IT WASN'T CLEAR TO US THAT

08:08:30.114 --> 08:08:32.616
THE BLAKELY BENEFITS THAT THAT

08:08:32.683 --> 08:08:33.384
ARE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE

08:08:33.450 --> 08:08:34.885
DEPARTMENT IS HOPING FOR WOULD

08:08:34.952 --> 08:08:35.686
BE OBTAINED.

08:08:35.753 --> 08:08:37.521
SO WE'D RECOMMEND IS THAT THE

08:08:37.588 --> 08:08:39.957
LEGISLATURE APPROVED SEVEN POINT

08:08:40.024 --> 08:08:41.992
ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE

08:08:42.059 --> 08:08:43.927
YEARS WHICH WOULD BE.

08:08:43.994 --> 08:08:45.229
ENOUGH TO STAFF -- TWENTY FOUR

08:08:45.295 --> 08:08:46.964
MEDICATION ROOMS WHICH WOULD

08:08:47.031 --> 08:08:48.832
GIVE THE DEPARTMENT ABILITY TO

08:08:48.899 --> 08:08:49.867
STOP THESE PSYCHIATRIC

08:08:49.933 --> 08:08:51.835
TECHNICIANS ACROSS A WIDE

08:08:51.902 --> 08:08:53.837
VARIETY OF UNIT TYPES.

08:08:53.904 --> 08:08:55.572
ON AND THEN EXAMINE WHETHER OR

08:08:55.639 --> 08:09:00.444
NOT IT DOES RESULT IN THE

08:09:00.511 --> 08:09:02.346
BENEFITS THAT ARE HOPE FOR LIKE

08:09:02.413 --> 08:09:03.347
BUT YOU KNOW REDUCTIONS IN

08:09:03.414 --> 08:09:04.181
VIOLENCE IN AN IMPROVEMENT IN

08:09:04.248 --> 08:09:04.481
OUR COMES.

08:09:04.548 --> 08:09:06.216
WITH RESPECT TO THE EVENING AND

08:09:06.283 --> 08:09:07.117
OVERNIGHT SUPERVISORS WE THINK

08:09:07.184 --> 08:09:08.652
THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE NEED

08:09:08.719 --> 08:09:10.888
AND WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVAL.

08:09:10.954 --> 08:09:12.956
THANK YOU FINANCE AND THIS WAS

08:09:13.023 --> 08:09:14.858
ALSO ONE OF THE MISSIONBASED I

08:09:14.925 --> 08:09:15.626
REVIEW PROJECTS WE WORKED ON

08:09:15.693 --> 08:09:17.795
THIS -- KICKED OFF I BELIEVE IN

08:09:17.861 --> 08:09:21.331
TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WITH A

08:09:21.398 --> 08:09:22.199

HOSPITALS IN THEIR STAFFING

08:09:24.835 --> 08:09:26.603
RATIOS -- AND THEN YOU SEE YOU

08:09:26.670 --> 08:09:27.905
SEE IRVINE CAME IN FOR A

08:09:27.971 --> 08:09:29.073
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME

08:09:29.139 --> 08:09:31.709
VISITED SEVERAL HOSPITALS -- AND

08:09:31.775 --> 08:09:33.343
SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH

08:09:33.410 --> 08:09:34.878
STATE HOSPITALS ON THE PROPOSAL --

08:09:34.945 --> 08:09:37.481
AND THEN -- MY TEAM CAME IN AND

08:09:37.548 --> 08:09:38.482
AND SPENT ABOUT A YEAR WORKING

08:09:38.549 --> 08:09:39.950
WITH STATE HOSPITALS ON THIS SO.

08:09:40.017 --> 08:09:41.485
IN MY FIFTEEN YEARS OF FINANCES

08:09:41.552 --> 08:09:43.721
IS PROBABLY THE BEST ANALYZE B.

08:09:43.787 --> 08:09:46.423
C. P. I'VE I'VE EVER DONE IT SO --

08:09:46.490 --> 08:09:50.294
I I DON'T KNOW THAT ANOTHER SORT

08:09:50.360 --> 08:09:51.662

08:09:51.729 --> 08:09:55.065
CONSULTANT ONE WOULD REALLY SORT

08:09:55.132 --> 08:09:57.101
OF YIELD DIFFERENT RESULTS I'M

08:09:57.167 --> 08:09:57.701
ALSO NOT SURE WOULD BE ABLE TO

08:09:57.768 --> 08:09:58.635
FIND SOMEONE WITH THAT.

08:09:58.702 --> 08:10:00.170
EXPERTISE ON STATE HOSPITALS TO

08:10:00.237 --> 08:10:03.741
TO DO SUCH A AN EVALUATION --

08:10:03.807 --> 08:10:06.009
IT'S A SORT OF A NICHE -- FIELD.

08:10:06.076 --> 08:10:08.011
AND IT'S A GOOD USE IT TOOK A

08:10:08.078 --> 08:10:09.113
LOT OF PEOPLE JUST A LONG TIME

08:10:09.179 --> 08:10:10.280
TO GET UP SPEED ON SORT OF WHAT

08:10:10.347 --> 08:10:12.082
THE OPERATIONS ARE OF THE

08:10:12.149 --> 08:10:14.284
CALIFORNIA STATE HOSPITALS -- I

08:10:14.351 --> 08:10:17.821
WOULD ALSO.

08:10:17.888 --> 08:10:19.757
NOTE THAT IT'S WHEN WE LOOK AT

08:10:19.823 --> 08:10:20.390
SORT OF WHAT THE STATE HOSPITAL

08:10:20.457 --> 08:10:22.559

LIFTING ON THIS AND THAT IS THE

08:12:50.774 --> 08:12:51.575
GOAL AND THE INTENTION IS TO

08:12:51.642 --> 08:12:53.110
SORT OF CONTINUE TO EVALUATE.

08:12:53.176 --> 08:12:54.745

BE YOU KNOW DOWN THE ROAD WE

08:13:13.530 --> 08:13:15.032
HAVE A DIFFERENT MIX OF UNITS

08:13:15.098 --> 08:13:16.733
THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND AND

STATE MINIMUM WAGE WE WOULD

08:18:55.171 --> 08:18:56.906
SUGGEST THAT IT SHOULD BE?

08:18:56.973 --> 08:19:00.610
THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND AND

08:19:00.677 --> 08:19:02.579

THIS PROPOSAL.

08:19:08.818 --> 08:19:11.187
WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST.

08:19:11.254 --> 08:19:15.091
THAT THERE IS A A FIVE HUNDRED

08:19:15.158 --> 08:19:16.960
DOLLAR CAP IN STATUTE DOWN FOR

08:19:17.027 --> 08:19:18.928
THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE RETAINED

08:19:18.995 --> 08:19:29.005
IN THE PATIENT'S FUNDS OTHER WHY

08:19:29.072 --> 08:19:29.539
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT

08:19:30.073 --> 08:19:30.940
IN THE AMOUNTS THAT TO EXCEED

08:19:31.007 --> 08:19:32.008
THAT CAN BE -- SWEAT FROM THE

08:19:32.075 --> 08:19:33.576
ACCOUNTS FOR A COST OF TREATMENT

08:19:33.643 --> 08:19:34.878
SO WITH THIS INCREASED AMOUNT WE

08:19:34.944 --> 08:19:36.846
WOULD SUGGEST LIFTING THE CAP --

08:19:36.913 --> 08:19:41.217
ALTOGETHER -- AND TO LET THE THE

08:19:41.284 --> 08:19:42.952

FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- NOT MUCH

08:19:52.362 --> 08:19:54.230
BENEFIT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

08:19:54.297 --> 08:19:56.900
HAPPENING -- FOR THE THE WORKERS

08:19:56.966 --> 08:19:59.703
ALSO -- THIRD POINT IS THERE IS

08:19:59.769 --> 08:20:02.639
A GROUP OF I THINK -- LITTLE

08:20:02.706 --> 08:20:05.308
OVER A AYE LITTLE UNDER A

08:20:05.375 --> 08:20:05.942
HUNDRED WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN

08:20:06.009 --> 08:20:08.778
RECEIVING -- THIS THE STATE

08:20:08.845 --> 08:20:10.313
MINIMUM WAGE AND WE WOULD

08:20:10.380 --> 08:20:11.715
SUGGEST THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS

08:20:11.781 --> 08:20:13.616
BE GRANDFATHERED IN AND NOT HAVE

08:20:13.683 --> 08:20:16.186
THE REDUCTION IF THE COURSE IS

08:20:16.252 --> 08:20:17.120
TO GO TO THE FEDERAL MINIMUM

08:20:17.187 --> 08:20:18.688

SO MAYBE IT'S DOES.

08:20:23.626 --> 08:20:26.629
ACTUALLY FIRST OF ALL THE FIVE

08:20:26.696 --> 08:20:28.064
HUNDRED DOLLARS ISN'T I MEAN.

08:20:28.131 --> 08:20:30.834
I REALIZE THAT THERE THESE

08:20:30.900 --> 08:20:32.602
PATIENTS ARE THERE TO IT BUT

08:20:32.669 --> 08:20:34.070
THIS IS IS THERE A REASON WE

08:20:34.137 --> 08:20:35.839
CAPPED OFF AT FIVE HUNDRED

08:20:35.905 --> 08:20:37.607
DOLLARS I REALIZE THIS IS AN

08:20:37.674 --> 08:20:39.242
OLDER POLICY.

08:20:39.309 --> 08:20:41.277
YEAH THERE'S AN OLDER POLICY I

08:20:41.344 --> 08:20:43.646
CAN KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE FIVE

08:20:43.713 --> 08:20:44.714
HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP PURPOSE SENSE

08:20:44.781 --> 08:20:46.549
IN YEAH SO I MEAN IT PROBABLY

08:20:46.616 --> 08:20:48.518
SOME IDEA IN THE PAST THAT

08:20:48.585 --> 08:20:49.619
SOMEONE SAID WELL SINCE HERE

08:20:49.686 --> 08:20:51.221
WE'RE PAYING FOR ALL THIS STUFF

08:20:51.287 --> 08:20:53.189
FOR YOU ORDERS AGO RECLAIM IT

08:20:53.256 --> 08:20:53.556
THAT THAT THAT.

08:20:53.623 --> 08:20:55.091
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AND I

08:20:55.158 --> 08:20:56.326
MEAN FOR THESE PATIENTS I WOULD

08:20:56.393 --> 08:21:02.031
JUST NOTE THAT FOR ME AS AS THAT

08:21:02.098 --> 08:21:03.199
FIVE HUNDRED CAP A IT DOING IN

08:21:03.266 --> 08:21:05.335
THE NINETEEN AND PARTS I DON'T

08:21:05.402 --> 08:21:05.969
HAVE THE CALCULATION FIND ME BUT

08:21:06.035 --> 08:21:06.836
THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT OUR

08:21:06.903 --> 08:21:08.204
PATIENTS WORK.

08:21:08.271 --> 08:21:08.872
IS -- IS.

08:21:08.938 --> 08:21:10.840
AT THE MOST ABOUT FIFTY HOURS

08:21:10.907 --> 08:21:13.710
PER MONTH AND SO THE THE

08:21:13.777 --> 08:21:17.747
CALCULATION OF THAT IS STILL-UNDERNEATH THAT FIVE HUNDRED CAP

08:21:17.814 --> 08:21:19.015
FOR THE MONTHLY.

08:21:19.082 --> 08:21:20.984
SOME FOR A MONTHLY. FIVE HUNDRED

08:21:21.050 --> 08:21:27.223
PER MONTH THERE'S A FIVE HUNDRED

08:21:27.290 --> 08:21:29.225
PERIOD.

08:21:29.292 --> 08:21:30.960
YEAH IT'S FIVE HUNDRED AT THE

08:21:31.027 --> 08:21:34.264
CITY SWEET BUT IT WOULD BE NICE.

08:21:34.330 --> 08:21:36.266
BY MONTH SO ANYTIME ON ACCOUNT

08:21:36.332 --> 08:21:37.400
EXCEEDS.

08:21:37.467 --> 08:21:37.934
FIVE HUNDRED THE PATIENTS

08:21:38.001 --> 08:21:38.535
NOTIFIED.

08:21:38.601 --> 08:21:39.736
WE WILL BE SWEEPING YOUR ACCOUNT.

08:21:39.803 --> 08:21:41.337
AND THEN TO LIVE SO EACH MONTH

08:21:41.404 --> 08:21:42.372
THEY CAN ONLY MAKE FIVE HUNDRED

08:21:42.439 --> 08:21:43.440
BUT THEY COULD CALCULATE FIVE

08:21:43.506 --> 08:21:44.274
HUNDRED EACH MONTH SO I MEAN

08:21:44.340 --> 08:21:45.208
IT'S UP TO FIVE HUNDRED SO YOU

08:21:45.275 --> 08:21:47.277
GET A FIVE HUNDRED A THOUSAND

08:21:47.343 --> 08:21:48.411
THOUSAND FIVE OR RIGHT BUT IT'S

08:21:48.478 --> 08:21:49.779
NOT BASED ON EARNED.

08:21:49.846 --> 08:21:51.981
YOU CAN RECEIVE MONEY IN OTHER

08:21:52.048 --> 08:21:53.183
WAYS.

08:21:53.249 --> 08:21:54.951
MEMBERS COULD FAMILY MEMBERS

08:21:55.018 --> 08:21:56.319
RELATIVE RIGHT HANDS COULD SEND

08:21:56.386 --> 08:21:58.021
MONEY AND SO ANYTIME YOU'RE

08:21:58.087 --> 08:22:01.057
THRESHOLD GOES BEYOND.

08:22:01.124 --> 08:22:01.691
FIVE HUNDRED THERE'S ATTEMPT TO

08:22:01.758 --> 08:22:04.160
SWEEP.

08:22:04.227 --> 08:22:06.863
WHY ARE WE DOING THAT?

08:22:06.930 --> 08:22:12.335
COST OF TREATMENT THAT SMILE.

08:22:12.402 --> 08:22:15.271
IT'S IN THE STANDING OUT.

08:22:15.338 --> 08:22:16.606
MAYBE IT WELL.

08:22:16.673 --> 08:22:17.807
IS THAT A COMMENTS FROM FINANCE

08:22:17.874 --> 08:22:19.509
YES NO IS I I DON'T KNOW THE

08:22:19.576 --> 08:22:20.176
EXACT WORDS BUT IT IT'S BASED ON

08:22:20.243 --> 08:22:20.844
CONVERSATION IS MY UNDERSTANDING

08:22:20.910 --> 08:22:22.879
THOUGH MANY OF THE TIMES THESE

08:22:22.946 --> 08:22:23.746
PATIENTS ARE SPENDING THEIR

08:22:23.813 --> 08:22:27.150
MONEY -- ADDED YOU KNOW CANTEEN

08:22:27.217 --> 08:22:27.717
THERE'S FOOD THERE'S FOOD

08:22:27.784 --> 08:22:29.452
VENDORS THAT THEY COULD SPEND

08:22:29.519 --> 08:22:31.020
THEIR MONEY ON SO.

08:22:31.087 --> 08:22:32.722
I MEAN THIS IS A THAT'S THEIR

08:22:32.789 --> 08:22:34.591
DECISION RIGHT AT WHETHER THEY

08:22:34.657 --> 08:22:41.564
WANT HI BUT I I SO I REALIZE

08:22:41.631 --> 08:22:41.764
THAT.

08:22:41.831 --> 08:22:42.899
WE HAVE THIS TO MY TO MY MIND A

08:22:42.966 --> 08:22:45.201
LITTLE ANTIQUATED.

08:22:45.268 --> 08:22:50.206
OF RIGHT I MEAN.

08:22:50.273 --> 08:22:50.874
AND AND THEN.

08:22:50.940 --> 08:22:54.010
I I I I I WOULD SUGGESTS LIVING

08:22:54.077 --> 08:22:55.311
IN A REALIZE IS NOT PART OF THE

08:22:55.378 --> 08:22:56.980
PROPOSAL'S BEEN SITTING THERE

08:22:57.046 --> 08:22:58.281
BUT IN MY MIND WHILE WE JUST GET

08:22:58.348 --> 08:22:59.782
RID OF THAT I AM NOT SURE WHY WE

08:22:59.849 --> 08:23:00.783
HAVE IT'S IT'S SENS WRONG

08:23:00.850 --> 08:23:02.185
MESSAGE TO PEOPLE RIGHT I MEAN

08:23:02.252 --> 08:23:03.286
REALLY IF THEY WANT. TO SPEND

08:23:03.353 --> 08:23:03.953
THEIR MONEY AND NOT HAVE ANYBODY

08:23:04.020 --> 08:23:04.787
THAT'S THAT'S FINE IF THEY WANT

08:23:04.854 --> 08:23:05.922
TO SAVE MONEY AND BUILD UP

08:23:05.989 --> 08:23:07.624
SOMETHING FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE

08:23:07.690 --> 08:23:08.525
THEY WANNA BUILD IT UP FOR I'M

08:23:08.591 --> 08:23:09.926
NOT SURE WHY WE'RE DISCOURAGING

08:23:09.993 --> 08:23:11.327
THAT BY SAYING THAT.

08:23:11.394 --> 08:23:13.396
HIS YOU SEE MORE IN FIVE HUNDRED

08:23:13.463 --> 08:23:13.997
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE MONEY

08:23:14.063 --> 08:23:15.031
FROM YOU THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF

08:23:15.098 --> 08:23:16.399
MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEND TO

08:23:16.466 --> 08:23:17.267
PEOPLE.

08:23:17.333 --> 08:23:19.736
SO WHY NOT JUST GET RID OF IT

08:23:19.802 --> 08:23:21.070
AND LESS THAN JUST AS OF DOLLARS

08:23:21.137 --> 08:23:21.838
OF FEDERAL REASON FOR HAVE IT

08:23:21.905 --> 08:23:22.839
WHY SHOULD THE STATE BE DOING

08:23:22.906 --> 08:23:23.273
THAT.

08:23:23.339 --> 08:23:24.774
WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT I DID

08:23:24.841 --> 08:23:26.209
WANT TO SHARE THE ONE KNOWS.

08:23:26.276 --> 08:23:28.144
I WAS TOURING AT METRO AND I

08:23:28.211 --> 08:23:29.879
HAPPEN TO COME ACROSS A A

08:23:29.946 --> 08:23:31.447
PAINTER PATIENT WORKER.

SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS.

IN THE EXAMPLE OF FULL SERVICE

08:27:52.408 --> 08:27:53.810
PARTNERSHIPS WERE FINDING A

08:27:53.876 --> 08:27:55.478
LARGE PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS AREN'T

08:27:55.545 --> 08:27:57.146

08:27:58.648 --> 08:28:00.283
MEETING GOALS.

08:28:00.349 --> 08:28:01.918
LOTS OF REASONS FOR THAT THE

08:28:01.984 --> 08:28:02.852
PEOPLE BEING SERVED BY FULL

08:28:02.919 --> 08:28:04.320
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS TEND TO BE

08:28:04.387 --> 08:28:06.222
THE MOST DIFFICULT TO SERVE IN

08:28:06.289 --> 08:28:07.456
COMMUNITY SETTINGS.

08:28:07.523 --> 08:28:08.591
FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WERE

08:28:08.658 --> 08:28:09.826
ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO KEEP

08:28:09.892 --> 08:28:11.160
PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL OUT OF STATE

08:28:11.227 --> 08:28:13.062

THAT WORK AND DO IT AND IN A IN

08:28:20.570 --> 08:28:22.772
A WITH WITH A BROADER FOCUS.

08:28:22.839 --> 08:28:24.440
THE COMMISSION CURRENTLY THE LAW

08:28:24.507 --> 08:28:25.875
CURRENTLY STE TESTIFIES TO THE

08:28:25.942 --> 08:28:27.210
COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY IS OVER

08:28:27.276 --> 08:28:29.846
THE IMAGE TO SAY BUT ALSO THE

08:28:29.912 --> 08:28:30.913
CHILDREN SYSTEM OF CARE DOSS

08:28:30.980 --> 08:28:31.581
MCCARRON OLDER ADULTS SYSTEM OF

08:28:31.647 --> 08:28:32.448
CARE.

08:28:32.515 --> 08:28:34.083
OUR WORK HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THE

08:28:34.150 --> 08:28:35.451
IMAGES SAY DOLLARS AND IMAGES

08:28:35.518 --> 08:28:37.386
THEY PROGRAMS MOSTLY BECAUSE OF

08:28:37.453 --> 08:28:38.988
RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS.

08:28:39.055 --> 08:28:40.590
OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT TO CREATE A

08:28:40.656 --> 08:28:41.490
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

08:28:41.557 --> 08:28:42.992
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE NEED TO

08:28:43.059 --> 08:28:44.760
SEE ALL THE COMPONENTS OF THAT

08:28:44.827 --> 08:28:46.729
IMAGE ESSAYS ABOUT 25% OF THE

08:28:46.796 --> 08:28:47.797
MONEY.

08:28:47.864 --> 08:28:49.265
AND ARGUABLY ABOUT 25% OF THE

08:28:49.332 --> 08:28:50.199
SYSTEM.

08:28:50.266 --> 08:28:52.602
IT'S VERY USEFUL TO KNOW A LOT

08:28:52.668 --> 08:28:54.237
ABOUT ONE OF THE TIRES ON YOUR

08:28:54.303 --> 08:28:56.239
CAR IT'S MORE USEFUL TO KNOW IF

08:28:56.305 --> 08:28:57.640
ALL FOUR OF THEM ARE GOING TO

08:28:57.707 --> 08:29:01.711
HOLD UP WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THAT

08:29:01.777 --> 08:29:02.812
LONG TRIP ACROSS THE DESERT.

08:29:02.879 --> 08:29:03.212
AS PART OF THAT.

08:29:03.279 --> 08:29:04.247
AS THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIES

08:29:04.313 --> 08:29:06.983
CHALLENGES WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

08:29:07.049 --> 08:29:09.986
OFFER STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS SOME

08:29:10.052 --> 08:29:11.153
OF THOSE CHALLENGES SO IN THE

08:29:11.220 --> 08:29:12.421
INSTANCE OF FULL SERVICE

08:29:12.488 --> 08:29:14.123
PARTNERSHIPS WERE WORKING WITH

08:29:14.190 --> 08:29:16.325
ABOUT A DOZEN COUNTIES TO DESIGN

08:29:16.392 --> 08:29:17.093
A COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION

08:29:17.159 --> 08:29:17.994
PROJECT.

08:29:18.060 --> 08:29:18.928
THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN THOSE FULL

08:29:18.995 --> 08:29:20.596
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE

08:29:20.663 --> 08:29:22.131
PROPOSALS AROUND DATA ARE TO

08:29:22.198 --> 08:29:23.966
STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY TO TELL

08:29:24.033 --> 08:29:25.801
THE LARGER STORY OF THE MENTAL

08:29:27.036 --> 08:29:27.970
AND OUTCOMES.

08:29:28.037 --> 08:29:29.572
BUT AS WE DO THAT OUTCOMES WORK

08:29:29.639 --> 08:29:30.773
WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE

08:29:30.840 --> 08:29:32.541
INNOVATION DOLLARS THAT WERE

08:29:32.608 --> 08:29:34.510

SUCCESSFUL THEY'RE OFTEN SEEN AS

08:29:48.925 --> 08:29:50.493
THE SANTA CLARA MIRACLE.

08:29:50.559 --> 08:29:51.727
AND WHAT WE WANT IS TO BRING

08:29:51.794 --> 08:29:53.396

CONCERN PARTICULAR ISSUES OF

08:29:56.666 --> 08:29:57.967
STATEWIDE CONCERN.

FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE

08:29:58.935 --> 08:30:00.236

DOLLAR ANNUAL INVESTMENT UNDER

08:30:01.537 --> 08:30:03.472
THE STATE'S RULES.

08:30:03.539 --> 08:30:05.608
THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST IN

08:30:05.675 --> 08:30:07.143
STRENGTHENING THAT AND SO OUR

08:30:07.209 --> 08:30:09.712
PROPOSAL IS TO LEVERAGE THIS TWO

08:30:09.779 --> 08:30:10.980
AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO

08:30:11.047 --> 08:30:12.615

IF HAVE -- IMAGE TO SAY

08:30:15.251 --> 08:30:16.052
INNOVATION DOLLARS.

08:30:16.118 --> 08:30:17.453
RELATED TO THAT IS THE THIRD

08:30:17.520 --> 08:30:19.255
ITEM ON HERE OF TECHNICAL

08:30:19.322 --> 08:30:20.222
ASSISTANCE.

08:30:20.289 --> 08:30:21.891
WE E ARE OF THE MIND THAT IN

08:30:21.958 --> 08:30:23.626
CALIFORNIA AND IN THE COUNTRY WE

08:30:23.693 --> 08:30:25.394
HAVE THE EXPERTISE THE AWARENESS

08:30:25.461 --> 08:30:27.863
THE CAPACITY. TO STRENGTHEN OUR

08:30:27.930 --> 08:30:29.665
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM BUT THAT

08:30:29.732 --> 08:30:32.068
CAPACITY ISN'T NECESSARILY IN A

08:30:32.134 --> 08:30:34.136
COUNTY OR IN ALL COUNTIES.

08:30:34.203 --> 08:30:37.673
AND SO THROUGH THE FACILITATION

08:30:37.740 --> 08:30:39.408
OF INNOVATION THE ADDITION OF OF

08:30:39.475 --> 08:30:40.876
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THERE'S

08:30:40.943 --> 08:30:43.145
A THIRD COMPONENT IT'S NOT IN

08:30:43.212 --> 08:30:44.380
FRONT OF YOU AT THE MOMENT.

08:30:44.447 --> 08:30:45.815
YEAH IT WAS ON THE AGENDA A

08:30:45.881 --> 08:30:50.152
COUPLE WEEKS AGO TO TREAT US

08:30:50.219 --> 08:30:51.620
DOLLARS AS INCENTIVE DOLLARS.

08:30:51.687 --> 08:30:53.322
THE IDEA IS WE WOULD DO THE DATA

08:30:53.389 --> 08:30:55.091
ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED CHALLENGES

08:30:55.157 --> 08:30:57.593
AND BE ABLE TO INVEST INCENTIVE

08:30:57.660 --> 08:30:59.929
DOLLARS T. A. AND FACILITATION

08:30:59.996 --> 08:31:02.365
TO STRENGTHEN THOSE PROGRAMS

08:31:02.431 --> 08:31:03.566
THAT NEED SOME WORK.

08:31:03.632 --> 08:31:05.701
SO THAT SO THE THE THE DATA

08:31:05.768 --> 08:31:07.837
WORKED INNOVATION SUPPORT THE TA

08:31:07.903 --> 08:31:10.139
AND THE TRIAGE MONEY WE TALKED

08:31:10.206 --> 08:31:12.041
ABOUT IT A PRIOR HEARING ARE

08:31:12.108 --> 08:31:14.010
PART OF THAT STRATEGY.

08:31:14.076 --> 08:31:16.879
SEPARATE FROM THAT IS A REQUEST

08:31:16.946 --> 08:31:18.714
TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS

08:31:18.781 --> 08:31:20.649
TO STRENGTHEN ADVOCACY ON BEHALF

08:31:20.716 --> 08:31:21.951
OF HAVING TO REFUGEES.

08:31:22.018 --> 08:31:24.320
WE RECEIVED FUNDING LAST YEAR --

08:31:24.387 --> 08:31:25.821
WE HAVE AWARDED THAT FOR THOSE

08:31:25.888 --> 08:31:27.857
FUNDS WERE AWARDED LAST WEEK

08:31:27.923 --> 08:31:29.859
WERE IN THAT APPEAL PROCESS AT

08:31:29.925 --> 08:31:30.760
THE MOMENT.

08:31:30.826 --> 08:31:32.728
BUT AS PART OF THIS WORK WE JUST

08:31:32.795 --> 08:31:35.398
HEARD OVERWHELMING STORIES OF

08:31:35.464 --> 08:31:36.899
THE STRUGGLES THAT IMMIGRANTS

08:31:36.966 --> 08:31:37.900

08:31:37.967 --> 08:31:39.201
CALIFORNIA WITH REGARD TO MENTAL

08:31:39.268 --> 08:31:40.503
HEALTH AND SO THE COMMISSION IS

08:31:40.569 --> 08:31:43.572
ASKING TO AUGMENT THAT SUPPORT.

08:31:43.639 --> 08:31:44.140
SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE WITH

08:31:44.206 --> 08:31:44.640
THOSE DOLLARS.

08:31:44.707 --> 08:31:47.877
THE LAST ITEM IN THE ANALYSIS IS

08:31:47.943 --> 08:31:51.614
THE M. P. E. I REQUEST UNDER SB --

08:31:51.680 --> 08:31:52.415
TEN FOR THE COMMISSION IS

08:31:52.481 --> 08:31:54.050
DIRECTED TO ESTABLISH A

08:31:54.116 --> 08:31:56.152
FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY AND AN

08:31:56.218 --> 08:31:57.520
EVALUATION COMPONENT FOR P. E.

08:31:57.586 --> 08:31:58.220
I..

08:31:58.287 --> 08:31:59.288
SIMILAR TO THE WORK WE'VE DONE

08:31:59.355 --> 08:32:01.090
WITH INNOVATION TO TRY TO BRING

08:32:01.157 --> 08:32:03.059
FOCUS TO THAT COMPONENT OF THE

08:32:03.859 --> 08:32:05.494
THIS IS REALLYIMPORTANT WORK IT

08:32:05.561 --> 08:32:08.697
IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT

08:32:08.764 --> 08:32:10.132
WORK BECAUSE OUR ABILITY TO BE

08:32:10.199 --> 08:32:11.834
EFFECTIVE THROUGH PREVENTION AND

08:32:11.901 --> 08:32:13.602
EARLY INTERVENTION CAN REDUCE

08:32:13.669 --> 08:32:15.037
OUR LONG TERM COSTS.

08:32:15.104 --> 08:32:17.506
AND JUST AS A REMINDER UNDER P.

08:32:17.573 --> 08:32:19.108
I'D THE LANGUAGE IS ABOUT

SUICIDE AND OTHER ISSUES AND SO

08:32:25.481 --> 08:32:27.817
WE SEE PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS IF

08:32:27.883 --> 08:32:29.085
WE CAN SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE

08:32:29.151 --> 08:32:29.718

THE TIME IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

08:34:12.488 --> 08:34:12.955

08:34:17.993 --> 08:34:21.030
DISPARITIES WE'RE NOT SEEING

08:34:21.096 --> 08:34:21.964
THINGS IMPROVE OVER TIME.

08:34:22.031 --> 08:34:24.033
AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO THINK

08:34:24.099 --> 08:34:25.234
AB WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH

08:34:25.301 --> 08:34:26.835

AND O WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S

08:34:33.075 --> 08:34:34.476
REALLY TWO PARTS TO THIS ONE IS

08:34:34.543 --> 08:34:35.678
AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ONE IS

08:34:35.744 --> 08:34:36.946

I'M ITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING

08:34:42.785 --> 08:34:44.453

THE BENCHMARK IN AND THAT IS OUR

08:34:50.392 --> 08:34:51.994
BIG HOLE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

08:34:52.061 --> 08:34:52.561

08:35:44.880 --> 08:35:46.415
DO WE BOTH TELL COUNTIES THEY

08:35:46.482 --> 08:35:47.616
NEED TO MEET SOME BENCHMARKS THE

08:35:47.683 --> 08:35:49.084
NEED TO REDUCE DISPARITIES BUT

08:35:49.151 --> 08:35:51.020
THEN REWARD THEM FOR DOING SO --

08:35:51.086 --> 08:35:51.787
SO THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL IN A

08:35:51.854 --> 08:35:53.589
NUTSHELL AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

08:35:53.656 --> 08:35:55.524
ANY QUESTIONS I'M AND I DO KNOW

08:35:55.591 --> 08:35:56.292
WILL BE SITTING DOWN WITH THE AC

08:35:56.358 --> 08:35:58.260
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

08:35:58.327 --> 08:35:59.261
LATER THIS WEEK ON IT.

08:35:59.328 --> 08:36:01.530
OKAY -- SO ANY COMMENTS FROM THE

08:36:01.597 --> 08:36:03.599
COMMISSION WE WE'VE TALKED WITH

08:36:03.666 --> 08:36:05.301
SAID WITH C. PAN AND AND THEIR

08:36:05.367 --> 08:36:06.735
PARTNERS IN TERMS OF THIS

08:36:06.802 --> 08:36:08.570
PROPOSAL AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S

08:36:08.637 --> 08:36:09.505
VERY MUCH ALIGNED.

08:36:09.571 --> 08:36:11.407
WITH A STRATEGY THAT WE'RE

08:36:11.473 --> 08:36:15.244
PROPOSING I IN I THINK THAT --

08:36:15.311 --> 08:36:16.845
YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION HAS NOT

08:36:16.912 --> 08:36:18.080
FORMALLY ENGAGED IN THIS IT'S

08:36:18.147 --> 08:36:20.015
VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE WORK

08:36:20.082 --> 08:36:21.750
THAT WE'RE DOING WE VERY MUCH

08:36:21.817 --> 08:36:23.152
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT DISPARITIES

08:36:23.218 --> 08:36:24.920
WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF WORK

08:36:24.987 --> 08:36:26.922
TO TRY TO MAP DISPARITIES USING

08:36:26.989 --> 08:36:28.424
THAT MEDICAL CLAIMS DATA.

08:36:28.490 --> 08:36:30.326
AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER

08:36:30.392 --> 08:36:31.760
OR NOT WE'RE REINFORCING

08:36:31.827 --> 08:36:33.595
DISPARITIES TO ACCESS KINDS OF

08:36:33.662 --> 08:36:36.332
STRATEGIES -- WE'VE REQUIRED

08:36:36.398 --> 08:36:39.201
UNDER OUR P. I REGULATIONS THAT

08:36:39.268 --> 08:36:41.203
THAT PROVIDERS REPORT OUT RACIAL

08:36:41.270 --> 08:36:42.938
AND ETHNIC AND OTHER DETAILED

08:36:43.005 --> 08:36:44.239
DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SO WE

08:36:44.306 --> 08:36:45.908
CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND ACTUALLY

08:36:45.974 --> 08:36:47.276
WHO IS RECEIVING CARE NOT JUST

08:36:47.343 --> 08:36:48.444
WHO WE PLANS ARE BECAUSE WE

08:36:48.510 --> 08:36:49.678
ACTUALLY SERVED.

08:36:49.745 --> 08:36:51.080
PART OF THE CHALLENGES THOSE

08:36:51.146 --> 08:36:53.282
THOSE THAT REGULATORY RULE ONLY

08:36:53.349 --> 08:36:54.817
APPLIES TO P. I. INNOVATION

08:36:54.883 --> 08:36:55.918
BECAUSE THAT'S THE LIMIT OF THE

08:36:55.984 --> 08:36:57.052
COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY.

08:36:57.119 --> 08:36:59.488
SO I I THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS IT

08:36:59.555 --> 08:37:01.623
YOU KNOW SPOT ON VERY CONSISTENT

08:37:01.690 --> 08:37:04.026
WITH THE WITH BOTH OUR STRATEGY

08:37:04.093 --> 08:37:06.295
AS WELL AS OUR AREAS OF CONCERN.

08:37:06.362 --> 08:37:08.263
I THINK YOU KNOW WE WOULD WANT

08:37:08.330 --> 08:37:10.265
TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

08:37:10.332 --> 08:37:11.600
THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE AND

08:37:11.667 --> 08:37:13.669
STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL INTERACT

08:37:13.736 --> 08:37:15.671
THEY CERTAINLY DON'T CONFLICT --

08:37:15.738 --> 08:37:21.510
INLET BUT BUT AS YOU KNOW OUR

08:37:21.577 --> 08:37:22.478
CONCERN WOULD BE IF YOU'RE IN A

08:37:22.544 --> 08:37:23.078
POSITION OF DOING ONE OR THE

08:37:23.145 --> 08:37:23.979
OTHER HOW WOULD YOU SORT OF

08:37:24.046 --> 08:37:24.313
MANAGE THAT.

08:37:24.380 --> 08:37:25.247
AND THAT'S A QUESTION OF ARE

08:37:25.314 --> 08:37:25.848
THERE ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND

08:37:25.914 --> 08:37:26.415
WITH EVERY SUPPORT AND AND I

08:37:26.482 --> 08:37:27.182
THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE

08:37:27.249 --> 08:37:28.450
CONVERSATION NEEDS TO MOVE

08:37:28.517 --> 08:37:30.419
FORWARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE

08:37:30.486 --> 08:37:32.521
MIGHT DO THAT OKAY.

08:37:32.588 --> 08:37:34.423
RIGHT AWAY -- COMMENTS.

08:37:34.490 --> 08:37:36.492
FINANCE OKAY SO I GUESS WE'LL

08:37:36.558 --> 08:37:37.860
ONE THE QUESTIONS I'VE SEEN BOTH

08:37:37.926 --> 08:37:39.962
THE THE FOR THE PROPOSALS IS

08:37:40.028 --> 08:37:40.362
THAT.

08:37:40.429 --> 08:37:42.064
SIR WAY THEY CAN KIND OF COME

08:37:42.131 --> 08:37:43.999
TOGETHER -- BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE

08:37:44.066 --> 08:37:45.134
WE CAN HAVE A STAND ALONE

08:37:45.200 --> 08:37:46.568
PROPOSAL LOOKING DISPARITIES BUT

08:37:46.635 --> 08:37:48.737
WE NOW HAVE THIS DATA COLLECTION

08:37:48.804 --> 08:37:49.905
ABOUT IT IS THAT I WELL CAN WE

08:37:49.972 --> 08:37:51.540
INCORPORATE.

08:37:51.607 --> 08:37:53.142
INTO THAT SO THAT WE'RE SO WE

08:37:53.208 --> 08:37:54.710
DON'T HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

08:37:54.777 --> 08:37:55.611
RUNNING.

08:37:55.677 --> 08:37:58.680
IN PARALLEL AND AND IN MANY WAYS

08:37:58.747 --> 08:38:00.482
THE ONLY.

08:38:00.549 --> 08:38:01.150
ONE THE THAT THAT'S VERY EASY TO

08:38:01.216 --> 08:38:02.684
BE ONE OF YOUR DATA ELEMENTS IN

08:38:02.751 --> 08:38:04.553
THE LARGER ONES YOU CAN FOLD

08:38:04.620 --> 08:38:05.954
THAT IN BUT LOW AND AND DO YOU

08:38:06.021 --> 08:38:07.923
HAVE CASH TO GET MORE OUT OF IT

08:38:07.990 --> 08:38:09.425
THAT WAY SO IS THAT SOMETHING.

08:38:09.491 --> 08:38:10.092
YOU'RE.

08:38:10.159 --> 08:38:11.960
LOOKING AT TALKING ABOUT YEAH I

08:38:12.027 --> 08:38:12.895
MEAN I THINK LIKE MOST HEARING

08:38:12.961 --> 08:38:14.863
SAID THAT'S THE CONVERSATION

08:38:14.930 --> 08:38:15.764
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE NEXT THEY

08:38:15.831 --> 08:38:17.966
THINK -- WE WOULD VERY MUCH

08:38:18.033 --> 08:38:19.334
AGREED DISPARITIES SHOULD BE A

08:38:19.401 --> 08:38:20.636
PIECE OF THINGS I THINK WE ALSO

08:38:20.702 --> 08:38:21.537
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

08:38:21.603 --> 08:38:23.372
REALLY A FOCUS OF ANY STRATEGY

08:38:23.439 --> 08:38:29.178
BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE SEEN.

08:38:29.244 --> 08:38:30.646
YOU KNOW WE'VE INVESTED. TWO

08:38:30.712 --> 08:38:31.613
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN MENTAL

08:38:31.680 --> 08:38:32.214
HEALTH SERVICES ACT RIGHT AND

08:38:32.281 --> 08:38:32.881
BECAUSE DISPARITIES HASN'T BEEN

08:38:32.948 --> 08:38:33.749
AN EXPLICIT FOCUS OF MOST OF THE

08:38:33.816 --> 08:38:34.550
WORK WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT

08:38:34.616 --> 08:38:35.250
REDUCING DISPARITIES IN SOME

08:38:35.317 --> 08:38:35.784
CASES FOR MAKING THEM.

08:38:35.851 --> 08:38:37.553
WORSE I THINK WE CAN DEFINITELY

08:38:37.619 --> 08:38:39.388
GO IN THAT DIRECTION WE JUST

08:38:39.455 --> 08:38:40.456
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS

08:38:40.522 --> 08:38:42.858
BOTH YEAH YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK

08:38:42.925 --> 08:38:44.593
WHAT YOU BUT YOU MAYES.

08:38:44.660 --> 08:38:47.029
SEE IS RABBI THE DATA SIDE MAKES

08:38:47.095 --> 08:38:48.130
SENSE TO INTEGRATE MAY THINK

08:38:48.197 --> 08:38:50.098
ABOUT.

08:38:50.165 --> 08:38:51.266
HAVING GAIL THE A COMPONENT OF

08:38:51.333 --> 08:38:52.201
WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT

08:38:52.267 --> 08:38:53.936
TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH

08:38:54.002 --> 08:38:56.872
THAT HAS MORE OF A DE CHARETTE

08:38:56.939 --> 08:38:59.107
SPERRY'S HAS A STAND ALONE EL

08:38:59.174 --> 08:39:00.676
HAS IS PARTICULAR FOCUS -- FOR

08:39:00.742 --> 08:39:03.011
CERTAIN PORTION OF THAT -- SO

08:39:03.078 --> 08:39:05.447
THAT -- DOESN'T GET LOST IN THE

08:39:05.514 --> 08:39:07.449
SHUFFLE KIND OF THING BUT ALL

08:39:07.516 --> 08:39:08.817
RIGHT WELL LIKE CHURCH THOSE

08:39:08.884 --> 08:39:10.786
CONVERSATIONS VITAL ALSO DON'T

08:39:10.853 --> 08:39:11.653
WANT TO HAVE LIKE.

08:39:11.720 --> 08:39:13.422
STILL DEEPLY CATION AND AN

08:39:13.489 --> 08:39:14.723
EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES SO.

08:39:14.790 --> 08:39:18.727
WE AGREE COMPLETELY AND I AND I

08:39:18.794 --> 08:39:20.229
THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW

08:39:20.295 --> 08:39:21.363
CONCEPTUALLY VALUE WISE WE'RE

08:39:21.430 --> 08:39:22.631
EXACTLY ON THE SAME PAGE THE

08:39:22.698 --> 08:39:24.666
QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE PATH TO

08:39:24.733 --> 08:39:26.168
GET THERE IN THE STRUCTURE OF

08:39:26.235 --> 08:39:27.302
THE BUDGET.

08:39:27.369 --> 08:39:29.671
SO THAT WEEK SO SO THAT IT'S NOT

08:39:29.738 --> 08:39:31.206
TOO DISPARATE SYSTEMS.

08:39:31.273 --> 08:39:32.841
THERE WERE ALSO NOT SORT OF YOU

08:39:32.908 --> 08:39:34.943
KNOW TRUST US WE WILL TAKE THIS

08:39:35.010 --> 08:39:37.112
ON RIDE INSIDE SO I DO THINK IN

08:39:37.179 --> 08:39:39.915
IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE C.

08:39:39.982 --> 08:39:44.653
PEN AND AND BUT IT CHAIR TAKING

08:39:44.720 --> 08:39:46.955
ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE -- WE WE

08:39:47.022 --> 08:39:48.056
WANT TO FIND THAT PATH AS WELL

08:39:48.123 --> 08:39:49.024
WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET

08:39:49.091 --> 08:39:50.359
THEN I GUESS THE OTHER PIECE

08:39:50.425 --> 08:39:51.727
RECOGNIZING THE LIMITATIONS OF

08:39:51.793 --> 08:39:53.095
THE COMMISSION TO IN TERMS OF

08:39:53.161 --> 08:39:55.464
DATA -- OR YOU ALSO LOOKING AT

08:39:55.531 --> 08:39:57.065
AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHY.

08:39:57.132 --> 08:39:58.800
BECAUSE SUMMER TEAMS BILLS OVER

08:39:58.867 --> 08:40:02.371
AND ASSEMBLY SEVEN CHANCE TO

08:40:02.437 --> 08:40:03.305
LOOK AT IT.

08:40:03.372 --> 08:40:04.606
IN TERMS OF DATA COLLECTION THAT

08:40:04.673 --> 08:40:05.607
WE REALLY CAN'T MEDI CAL THE

08:40:05.674 --> 08:40:07.876
MENTAL HEALTH -- DATA COLLECTION

08:40:07.943 --> 08:40:08.877
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T CUTS I MEAN.

08:40:08.944 --> 08:40:10.646
THE CELL TO BE SURE THAT -- WE

08:40:10.712 --> 08:40:11.980
GET THE DATA YEAH THE AND

08:40:12.047 --> 08:40:13.382
DEFINITELY I THINK THAT'S PART

08:40:13.448 --> 08:40:14.449
OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE BILL

08:40:14.516 --> 08:40:15.517
AND WOULD HOPE TO BRING INTO

08:40:15.584 --> 08:40:16.618
THIS TOO I THINK.

08:40:16.685 --> 08:40:17.853
YOU KNOW WE'VE LOOKED AT A LOT

08:40:17.920 --> 08:40:18.954
OF THE MEDICAL DATA THAT'S WHAT

08:40:19.021 --> 08:40:20.255
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH

08:40:20.322 --> 08:40:21.590
PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS.

08:40:21.657 --> 08:40:24.259
IN OUR BILL WE ALSO REQUIRE --

08:40:24.326 --> 08:40:25.127
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

08:40:25.193 --> 08:40:26.328
SERVICES IN THE OFFICE OF HEALTH

08:40:26.395 --> 08:40:27.763
EQUITY AND THE SURGEON GENERAL

08:40:27.829 --> 08:40:28.730
TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ARE

08:40:28.797 --> 08:40:30.299
TRYING TO BRING FROM AN AGENCY

08:40:30.365 --> 08:40:33.402
LEVEL TO ALL OF THE DATA INTO

08:40:33.468 --> 08:40:33.869
ONE PLACE I THINK IT'S

08:40:33.936 --> 08:40:35.337
DEFINITELY ARTICLE.

08:40:35.404 --> 08:40:38.273
OKAY ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS.

BECAUSE UNTIL AFTER A REVISED

08:40:48.850 --> 08:40:50.285
