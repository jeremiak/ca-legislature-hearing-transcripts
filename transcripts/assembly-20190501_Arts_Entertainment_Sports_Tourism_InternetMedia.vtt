00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.395
EIGHT HUNDRED SO IN IN IN ALL

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:20.498
THREE OF THOSE BILLS -- THERE

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:21.766
THERE WAS NO FORMAL GOVERNING

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.368
BODY THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT BODY

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:24.836
IN ANY OF THOSE BILLS WE CARRY

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:26.337

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.544
GOVERNING DESIGN IN IN THE BILL

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:35.179
SO THERE'S A THERE'S A STATUTE

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:39.083
THERE THAT REQUIRES -- THE LEAKS

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.352
TO DECLARE THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:42.553
AB.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.755

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:52.296
ITERATIONS OF THE BILLS SO SO SO

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:57.201

PLENTY OF TIME.

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.456
IT CO INC COMBINED WITH --

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.392
ANOTHER -- REQUIREMENT OF THE

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:17.228

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:39.583
I SEE.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.719
OKAY ANOTHER TEST OF SALT -- IS

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:44.822

BUT THOUGH FROM MY THE KNOWLEDGE

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:58.602
IS THAT THE WHATEVER SOFT.

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:04.775
PAD THIS -- INSIDE.

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:05.776

I ONE THIRTY FIVE THERE IS ANY --

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:09.714
ONE TRYING TO DEVELOP BY.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.751
THE EXTERNAL IMPACT IS DOUBLE

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:14.819
HARD TO YOU KNOW GET.

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:17.688

IF DOES SELF ABSORBED OVER

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:30.401
MATERIAL X. TONE ON THE IN A

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.837
SOFT.

00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:34.405

VERY INTERESTING OPTION BECAUSE

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:38.736
OF THE STRENGTH OF THE NECK.

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:40.404

PLAYER THE POSITION SOME HELMETS

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.553

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.102
POINTS OUT -- AND I THINK ONE OF

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:01.271
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE --

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:01.838
CURRENTLY IN OUR SOCIETY IS

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:02.472
WE'VE WE HAVE WE HAVE BEGIN THE

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:04.841
ISOLATE OURSELVES SO MUCH SO.

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:06.576
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR.

OTHER VIEW POINTS AND WE DON'T

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:08.879
HEAR OTHER VIEW POINTS AND

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:10.514
THAT'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IN A

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.982
IN A CIVIL SOCIETY.

00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:13.016
IN ORDER FOR TO BE HEALTHY WE

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:14.951
NEED TO HEAR LOTS OF DIFFERENT

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:17.387
VIEWPOINTS -- THIS WAS SORT OF

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:18.755
ON I THINK THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:19.856
THE MULLER REPORT.

00:49:19.923 --> 00:49:24.961
ACTUALLY WHERE THE RUSSIAN -- ME

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:26.830
OF THE RUSSIAN THE INTERESTS

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:28.165
THAT WERE INTERFERE ELECTIONS

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:29.466
THEY WERE CREATING.

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:32.936
SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS. TO

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:35.405
SPECIFICALLY GO TO AREA STE TO

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:36.873
SPECIFICALLY TARGET LIKE

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.209
ISOLATED GROUPS TEA PARTY.

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:42.646
BLACK LIVES MATTER -- YOU KNOW

KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:48.051
BASICALLY TARGET IN SIGHT THOSE

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:49.720
GROUPS TO GET ANGRY ABOUT AN

00:49:49.786 --> 00:49:53.857
ISSUE IN ORDER TO SOW DISCORD --

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.092
AND I THINK WHEN WHEN WE WHEN WE

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:56.493
ALLOW OURSELVES BECOME MORE

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.928
ISOLATED THIS IS BEEN FURTHER

00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.029
EXACERBATED BUT WE KNOW THAT

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.430
FACEBOOK ACTUALLY STARTED

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:01.431
ALGORITHM.

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.799
WHERE YOU WOULD GET MORE OF THE

IF YOU'RE CONSERVATIVE YOU'RE

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.775
ONLY GOING TO GET CONSERVATIVE

PROGRESSIVE YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:14.878
GET THOSE VIEWPOINTS I THINK

00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:16.413
THAT CONTINUES.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.714
TO REALLY MORE DIVIDE US AN

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:19.049
ISOLATED US.

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:20.217
RATHER THAN DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:22.018

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:07.684
BIASED MODERATING IS NOT CORRECT.

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:09.152

THAT THIS BILL WILL ALLOW BAD

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.908
ACTORS TO CLAIM THAT THEY'RE

BEING CENSORED FOR POLITICAL

00:53:33.476 --> 00:53:34.411
REASONS WHEN IN FACT OF BEING

BANNED OR MODERATED FOR OTHER

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:39.049
REASONS -- AND NOT BEING BASED

SHOW THE CONTENT THEY FIND

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:52.696
OBJECTIONABLE.

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:54.130

PLATFORMS TOOLS TO SERVE THE

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:59.502
USERS -- SO AGAIN WE LOOK AT

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:48.464
WE'RE COMING FROM WITH THE BILL

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:49.299
I MUST CALL THE LAST NIGHT AFTER

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:51.100
READ THIS BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.902
QUESTIONS BUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:59.309
PAST LIFE AND AND I HAVE NOT

00:57:59.375 --> 00:58:01.411
SEEN TO THE CHALLENGES THAT I

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:02.612
THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:03.446

WE WANT TO FOSTER -- A FREE FLOW

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:09.619
OF COMMUNICATION -- I THINK THE

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:11.254
WHAT I'M WHAT I'M GATHERING IS

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.355
THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:13.857
THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE.

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.158
THAT SOMEHOW THE TEAS AND SEE

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:17.126
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE NOT.

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:19.229
ADEQUATE -- I GUESS THE FIRST

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:20.797
QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR MAJOR

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:21.998
SOCIAL MEDIA SITES THEY ALL HAVE

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:23.466
TERMS AND CONDITIONS RIGHT RED

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:24.734
OKAY SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:26.536
SOLVE THAT.

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:29.038
BUT YOUR BILL SAYS -- IF YOU'RE

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:31.040
OPERATING A WEBSITE YOU SHOULD

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:32.442
REMOVE OR MEDICALLY CONTENT

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:33.843

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.311

WEBSITES TERMS AND CONDITIONS

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:37.347
BUT YOU DON'T PROVIDE ANY

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:39.148
GUIDANCE OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE IN

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:39.782
THOSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS YOU

00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:40.850
SIMPLY SAY YOU LEAVE IT UP TO

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:45.455
THE WEBSITE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:46.823
SHOULD BE IN THE CITY'S SEES.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.390
RIGHT RIGHT.

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:49.058
SO IF THERE'S NO GUIDANCE AND

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:50.193

DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:57.267
I'M JUST TRYING TO REALLY

00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:59.569
ESTABLISH THAT LOOK WE DON'T

00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:00.837
WANT TO BLOCK.

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:03.273
CONTENT PURELY BASED ON

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:05.174
POLITICAL -- VIEWED THE

00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:06.843
POLITICAL VIEWPOINT BRANCH I

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.677
THINK IS ALREADY AN ESTABLISHED

COMPANIES AND I THINK THAT'S

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:24.827
WHERE THIS COMING BECAUSE THEY

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:27.497

HOWEVER THERE WERE IN THIS KIND

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:32.035
OF GRAY ONE WORLD A LITTLE BIT

00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:33.569
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:59:33.636 --> 00:59:35.505
THE GOVERNMENT BUT WE KNOW THAT

PLATFORM FOR A LOT OF ISSUES A

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:41.811
DISCUSSION.

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:42.679
THEY'RE A MATTER OF PUBLIC

00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:44.447
CONCERN I MEAN ALL OF US HAVE

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.382
FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS.

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:47.216
WE SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:50.053
VERY MUCH A LOT OF POLITICAL

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:51.354
DISCUSSIONS THAT GO ON ON

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:52.855
VARIOUS ISSUES.

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:54.524

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:03.266
MUCH HAS BECOME.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.434
SORT OF A BECAUSE I HAD LIMITED

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.003
PUBLIC FORUM RIGHT AND SO WE

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.871
WANT TO PROTECT THAT WHILE ALSO

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.139
GIVING THE PRIVATE COMPANY.

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:11.507
THE ABILITY USE THEIR TERMS AND

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:13.176
CONDITIONS TO STATE OUT RIGHT

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.744
FOR EVERYBODY HEY HERE'S HOW

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.346
WE'RE GOING TO OPERATE OUR SITE

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:18.181

BLOCKING YOUR OR TAKE DOWN YOUR

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:23.886
POST.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.388
WHAT WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT --

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.156
THE COMPANIES ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.891
ALL HAVE VERY CLEARLY LAID OUT

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.493
TERMS AND CONDITIONS THERE ARE

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.363
MANY MANY LAWYERS AND INTERNAL

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:34.764
FOLKS WITHIN COMPANIES SPENT A

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:35.898
LOT OF TIME FIGURE THIS OUT AND

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.567
THEY DO LAID OUT AND I WILL SAY

01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:39.369
PERSONALLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:41.170
I WISH THAT THE COMPANIES THAT A

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:43.072
LITTLE BIT MORE TO ADDRESS THE

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:44.941
HATE SPEECH IN THE VIOLENCE THAT

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:45.508
WE SEE AND I'LL JUST GIVE

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:47.910
EXAMPLES ONE I HAVE PROPOSED PRO

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.245
LGBT.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.914
BILLS THE VIOLENTLY HATEFUL AND

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.816
HOMOPHOBIC COMMENTS THAT WE GET

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.184
ON OUR WEBSITES ARE ARE VERY

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:58.121
INTENSE WHEN I PROPOSED PRO GUN

01:00:58.187 --> 01:00:58.821
SAFETY BILLS.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:01.424
THE SUPPORTERS OF GUN RIGHTS

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.527
HAVE BEEN VERY VIOLENTLY AND

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:05.928
VEER AT LADY -- OUTSPOKEN IN

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.764
THEIR PERSPECTIVE WHEN I PROPOSE

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.365
PRO IMMIGRANT.

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:12.902
LAWS -- ANTI IMMIGRANT FORCES --

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:15.138
DESCEND ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE AND

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.439
OTHER PAGES IN A VERY INTENSE

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.141
WAY -- AND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.742
THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY LITTLE

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.611
CENSORSHIP IF NOT NO CENSORSHIP

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:22.779
THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT'S

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.514
ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE SOCIAL

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.249
MEDIA SITES AGAIN I'M JUST.

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:27.417
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.085
PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.953
A WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS --

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.289
YOU'RE LAYERING ON A RULE THAT

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:41.631
SAYS IF YOU OPERATE A WEBSITE.

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:42.231
YOU CAN'T REMOVE THIS CONTENT

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:43.866
AND LET'S IT'S PROVIDED BY YOUR

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:44.801
THIESSEN SEES BUT THAT'S ALREADY

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:45.468
HAPPENING SO I'M JUST NOT IT TO

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.269
ME FEELS LIKE THIS IS JUST

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:46.569
CONFUSING.

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:47.770
WHAT THE STANDARD OUGHT TO BE

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:48.404
FOR FOR THESE COMPANIES AND AND

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.038
AGAIN AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN A

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:49.705
LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:50.640
BUT ALSO INTERACTED WITH A LOT

01:01:50.706 --> 01:01:51.774
OF INDIVIDUALS?

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:52.942
WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.377
OUT I JUST DON'T SEE THAT

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.912
HAPPENING AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:58.047
CONFUSING THE ROLE SO I'M

01:01:58.114 --> 01:01:58.614
WONDERING IF THE INTERNET

01:01:58.681 --> 01:01:59.682
CESSATION KIND OF WHAT YOUR

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.717
EXPERIENCES YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:02.318
GRAPPLE WITH THESE ISSUES HAS

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.152
BEEN?

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.787
YEAH I THINK THE QUESTION AND I

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.289
I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO A

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:07.623
BETTER JOB OF MODERATING CONTENT

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:08.424
I MEAN I THINK WE'RE HEARING

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.425
THAT.

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:10.660
UNIVERSALLY THROUGHOUT THE

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:13.396
COUNTRY AND INTERNET ASSOCIATION

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:14.430
MEMBERS IN THE BIG INTERNET

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:14.997
PLATFORMS ARE TRYING TO DO

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:15.998
BETTER MODERATING CONTENT SO I

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.968
HEAR YOU ON THAT AND WE TOTALLY

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:20.970
AGREE WITH YOU -- FUNDAMENTALLY

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:22.171
THE PLATFORMS DO NOT MODERATE

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.439
BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINT

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:24.841
THEY MODERATE BASED ON HATE

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.442
SPEECH INCITEMENT ETCETERA.

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.743
SO THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE WITH

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:28.778
THIS BILL THIS BILL DOESN'T

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:30.680
ADDRESS THAT OR MAKE IT BETTER.

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.181
BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.583
FOLKS WHO ARE MODERATED OR

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.351
CENSORED AN AVENUE TO POINT SEE

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.252
THIS IS ACTUALLY BASED ON

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:38.187
POLITICAL VIEWPOINT.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.722
AND ONE PERSON HATE SPEECH MAYBE

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:40.690
ANOTHER PERSON'S POLITICAL

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:42.658
VIEWPOINT RIGHT I MEAN.

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.494
WE SEE THAT A LOT NGUYEN.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.229
YOU KNOW COMMENTATORS WHO ARE

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.131
YOU KNOW PERPETRATING YOU KNOW

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.465
HOAX VIDEOS ETCETERA DO GET

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:51.134
SENSORS SAYING IT'S BECAUSE I'M

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.734
CONSERVATIVE IT'S NOT BECAUSE

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:52.869
THE CONTENT.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:53.669
SO WE THINK THIS ACTUALLY

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:56.372
DOESN'T REMEDY THE SITUATION --

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:57.840
CONTENT STILL TO BE MODERATED

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:58.674
BASED ON EXISTING TERMS OF

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.309
SERVICE AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:01.978
DO IS CREATE FURTHER DIVISION BY

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:04.780
GIVING -- FOLKS AN INCORRECT

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.249
VIEW TO POINT TO A SINGER

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:07.216
MODERATING ME BASED ON POLITICAL

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:07.950
VIEWPOINT LOOK AT THE

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:09.085
RECOGNITION CALIFORNIA LAW YOU

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.720
CAN'T DO THAT.

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:11.888
AND WE'RE STILL MODERATING NEED

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:14.090
DO A BETTER JOB OF CLEANING UP

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:17.793
THE PLATFORMS TO ADDRESS THE

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.595
THINGS THAT YOU IDENTIFIED.

01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:20.963
I AM HAPPY TO CONTINUE ENGAGE IN

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:21.531
THE CONVERSATION BUT BUT I'M

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:22.064
JUST WORRIED THAT WE'RE OR

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:22.632
ACTUALLY MAKING THINGS MORE

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:24.100
CONFUSING FOR STANDARDS AS

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.635
OPPOSED TO LESS AND SO FOR THAT

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:26.736
I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:28.905
BILL TODAY BUT AGAIN WE SHOULD

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.206

BUT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.758
BETTER IF YOU TALK TO A LOT OF

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:36.859
THE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT THEY

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:38.227
WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS HAPPENING

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:39.428
A LOT MORE TO THE LEFT.

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.996

DISTRICT TO CONSTANTLY GET

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.869
KICKED OFF OF VARIOUS SOCIAL

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.471
MEDIA SITES AND THEN KIND OF

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:50.539
FIND A WAY TO GET BACK IN AND

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:52.475
GET KICKED OFF AGAIN -- I

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.643
HAVEN'T DELVED INTO EXACTLY WHY

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.278
BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AN EQUAL

01:06:56.345 --> 01:07:00.416
OPPORTUNITY -- PROBLEM SO -- IF

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:01.450
IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER THAT

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.052
IT'S NOT JUST FOLKS THAT ARE ON

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.687

ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.459
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S YOU

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:11.927
THE THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE WITH

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.462
SOCIAL MEDIA GOES SO MUCH DEEPER

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.097
AND HAS SO MUCH MORE TO DO WITH

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.632
THEIR ALGORITHMS.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.634
HELP CONTENTS FILTERED AND FED

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:22.004
BACK TO PEOPLE -- CREATING --

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:24.407
KIND OF ECHO CHAMBERS OF PEOPLE

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:25.875
WHO ARE ONLY BE EXPOSED TO THEIR

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:26.976
OWN VIEWS WHICH IS NOT A

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:28.377
QUESTION OF CENSORSHIP IT'S A

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:29.879
QUESTION OF A EYES AND

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:32.281
ALGORITHMS AND HOW THEY CHOOSE.

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:34.283
TO FEED CONTENT TO PEOPLE WHICH

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.284
THIS BILL DOESN'T YOU KNOW

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:36.585
ADDRESSING WHICH IS YOU KNOW

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:40.523
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT THERE I

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:41.157
WOULD HOPE OR THINKING ABOUT AT

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:41.624
THIS POINT [inaudible]

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.259
AND I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S A YOU

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:45.060
KNOW IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:46.028
PHENOMENON.

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.463
AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH THEIR

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:48.631
ISSUES OF BOTS AND

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.399
MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AND

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:51.500
THAT.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:54.069
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHO'S

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:56.105
BEHIND ACCOUNTS THAT THEN START

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.506
TO SHAPE OPINIONS AND HOW THAT

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.141
ENDS UP THROUGH THEIR OWN PAID

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.277
ADVERTISING BECOME EVEN BECOMING

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:02.445
EVEN MORE AMPLIFIED.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.446
AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.747
DO BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:06.449
SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THESE WITH

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:07.750
A LOT OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.051
YOU KNOW VERY DEEPLY CONCERNING

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.386
PROBLEMS WITH SITES LIKE

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:11.687

AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.758
YOUR TIME TO JUMP INTO A BUT I

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.493
THINK THAT WHAT WHAT THEY NEED.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.462
IS A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:21.797
KIND OF DECONSTRUCTION OF WHAT'S

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:24.033
HAPPENING AND WAYS OF DEALING

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:25.768
WITH IT AND I DO THINK THAT THIS

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.303
BILL YOU KNOW WHILE I I AGREE

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:28.871
VERY WELL INTENTIONED I DON'T

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:29.738
KNOW THAT IT REALLY HELPS MOVE

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:30.439
THAT.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:31.507
EFFORT FORWARD IN THE WAY THAT

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:34.043
IT NEEDS TO BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:34.810
BIGGER [inaudible]

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.412
ISSUE THEN.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:36.946
YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:38.347
CENSORING PARTICULAR POLITICAL

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:39.782
VIEWS WHICH THEY MAY OR MAY NOT

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:40.950
BE BUT EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T AND

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:42.418
I WILL TAKE HIM AT FACE VALUE

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:43.886
THAT THEY'RE NOT.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.354
THERE'S STILL STUFF THAT'S THAT

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:47.022
IS GOING SIDEWAYS HERE THAT'S

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:47.890
THAT'S LEADING AND AND IN TERMS

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.025
OF SUCH AS A BY I HAVE A GUN

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:50.392

THERE'S THE VERY THINLY VEILED

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:55.598
VIOLENT THREATS ON MY OFFICIAL

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:57.399
PAGE THAT.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.901
NO ONE'S TAKING DOWN I'M NOT

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.870
GONNA YOU KNOW REPORT IT MYSELF

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:02.972

WAS ROUTINELY BEING CENSORED WE

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:06.075
WOULDN'T BE SEEING THESE POSTS

POPPING UP LIKE WE ARE -- AND

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.144

MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AND UNDER

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.853
WHAT SET OF CRITERIA SO.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.455
I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY I

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:20.523
EVEN THOUGH I AGREE WITH THE

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.057
PHILOSOPHY OF WHAT'S BEHIND IT I

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:23.425
JUST THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:24.260
NEED TO BE A MUCH MORE

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.861

THEMSELVES AND I KNOW THAT

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:32.301
THEY'RE ENGAGED IN THAT ON THE

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.569
FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:34.904

COMING FROM CALIFORNIA AS WE SEE

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.275
MORE REAL HARM.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.876
BEING INFLICTED ON THE COMMUNITY --

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.711
THE FACT THAT I HAVE A STAFFER

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:46.215
