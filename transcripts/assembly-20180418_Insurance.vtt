00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.026 region:rollup2
BEEN. HISTORICALLY A WIN WIN

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:16.794 region:rollup2
WIN.

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:17.929 region:rollup2

SCALE ALSO OF THE DEBRIS IS

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:25.270 region:rollup2
REMOVED UP OF MORE MORE CHEAPLY

00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:26.137 region:rollup2

THE LOCAL ENTITY OR OTHER STATE

00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:34.979 region:rollup2

DEBRIS REMOVAL HAS TWO YEARS.

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:19.757 region:rollup2
TO LET THE INSURER KNOW WHAT THE

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:21.092 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE.

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:22.894 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE YEAR IF IT'S NOT A

DECLARED DISASTER

00:39:22.894 --> 00:39:24.362 region:rollup2
THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD TAKE

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:25.797 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:28.166 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IN A DECLARED

00:39:25.797 --> 00:39:30.768 region:rollup2
DISASTER AND CUT IT DOWN TO SIX

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:32.904 region:rollup2
WE FEAR THAT WHAT THE IMPACT OF

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:35.807 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE TO SHIFT WHAT

00:39:32.904 --> 00:39:38.009 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE PRIVATE INSURER COSTS.

00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:39.777 region:rollup2
OVER ONTO PUBLIC ENTITIES SUCH

00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:41.079 region:rollup2
AS COUNTIES WHICH WILL ALREADY

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:42.947 region:rollup2
BE STRAPPED FOR RESOURCES IN

00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:44.349 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH.

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:46.217 region:rollup2
THE DISASTER THAT JUST OCCURRED

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:47.919 region:rollup2

CORPS OF ENGINEERS OR WHOEVER

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.423 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE OVERSEEING THAT. WE

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:54.158 region:rollup2
WILL ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT WE

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:55.260 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE THE IMMUNITY LANGUAGE.

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:56.294 region:rollup2
WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.096 region:rollup2
NOTION THAT INSURERS ARE TO BE

00:39:56.294 --> 00:39:59.864 region:rollup2
IMMUNE FOR ACTING IN GOOD FAITH

00:39:58.096 --> 00:40:01.266 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA FAR FROM IT. BUT WE

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:02.533 region:rollup2
DO BELIEVE THAT THE IMMUNITY

00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:03.201 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THE

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:06.204 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT I SAW LATE LAST

00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:07.739 region:rollup2
NIGHT. IS OVERLY BROAD AND COULD

00:40:06.204 --> 00:40:09.674 region:rollup2
THEORETICALLY PROVIDE IMMUNITY

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:12.143 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE OR JUST FOR THE

00:40:09.674 --> 00:40:13.645 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO.

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:15.213 region:rollup2
A COMPLY AS OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY

00:40:13.645 --> 00:40:16.514 region:rollup2
COMPLYING.

00:40:15.213 --> 00:40:17.582 region:rollup2
SO WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:18.182 region:rollup2
WITH THE AMENDMENTS HOPEFULLY

00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:19.784 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:21.185 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE.

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:22.887 region:rollup2
I DEALT WITH OVER TIME.

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:24.222 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHICH IS THAT THE

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.956 region:rollup2
MEMBER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

00:40:24.222 --> 00:40:28.426 region:rollup2
SHIFTING THESE COSTS ON TO

00:40:24.956 --> 00:40:28.960 region:rollup2
LOCALS IS PROBABLY OF CONCERN.

IT'S CURRENTLY TWENTY FOUR

00:41:43.368 --> 00:41:46.771 region:rollup2
MONTHS IT'S TWENTY FOUR MONTHS

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:48.072 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THAT.

00:41:46.771 --> 00:41:49.273 region:rollup2
UNDER DECLARE DISASTER A

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:51.376 region:rollup2
GUBERNATORIAL HE DECLARED

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:52.877 region:rollup2
DISASTER IN A NORMAL NON

00:41:51.376 --> 00:41:53.845 region:rollup2
DISASTER SITUATION WHERE THERE'S

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:55.179 region:rollup2
TO REMOVE NECESSARY IT'S TWELVE

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:56.381 region:rollup2
MONTHS

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:57.348 region:rollup2
SO IN EITHER CASE YOU EITHER

00:41:56.381 --> 00:41:59.017 region:rollup2
CUTTING IT FROM TWENTY FOUR TO

IN A DISASTER OR TWELVE TO SIX

00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:03.755 region:rollup2
AND A NON DISASTER BUT WERE

00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:05.490 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY FOCUSING ON THE

00:42:03.755 --> 00:42:07.191 region:rollup2
DISASTER. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.960 region:rollup2
THESE CONSOLIDATED DEBRIS

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:09.927 region:rollup2
REMOVAL PROGRAMS TEND TO OCCUR

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.130 region:rollup2
GOT IT SO.

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:13.698 region:rollup2
EVEN ONLY IN IN MY MIND I'M

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.000 region:rollup2
THINKING WHAT WHILE SIX MONTHS

00:42:13.698 --> 00:42:17.268 region:rollup2
FROM THE TIME OF OF REMOVAL FROM

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.669 region:rollup2
THE TIME OF COMPLETION SEEMS

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:21.773 region:rollup2
LIKE. THAT'S PRETTY ADEQUATE

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:23.608 region:rollup2
TIME BUT WHY IS IT THAT YOU

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:25.209 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU WOULD SAY SIX MONTHS

00:42:23.608 --> 00:42:26.744 region:rollup2
IS TOO SHORT OF A TIME IS IT.

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:27.845 region:rollup2
BUT I MEAN IF I'M CLEANING OFF A

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:30.481 region:rollup2
PIECE OF PROPERTY.

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:31.649 region:rollup2
BUT. IF I UNDERSTAND RIGHT WE'RE

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:32.617 region:rollup2
NOT TALKING THAT JUST A SINGLE

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:34.018 region:rollup2
PIECE OF PROPERTY WE'RE TALKING

00:42:32.617 --> 00:42:36.053 region:rollup2
ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:37.321 region:rollup2
SOME CASES MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:38.790 region:rollup2
OR GROUPS THAT ARE HANDLING THE

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.924 region:rollup2
DEBRIS REMOVAL. AND WE'RE

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:41.426 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IT'S LESS THAN

00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:43.628 region:rollup2
CRYSTAL CLEAR IN THE LANGUAGE

00:42:41.426 --> 00:42:45.029 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING INTO THE BILL.

00:42:43.628 --> 00:42:46.998 region:rollup2
WHAT?

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:49.400 region:rollup2
REMOVED ON YOUR PROPERTY REMOVED

00:42:46.998 --> 00:42:51.202 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE THE WHOLE SWATH OF THE

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.270 region:rollup2
DISASTER AREA AT MY COLLEAGUE

00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:52.870 region:rollup2
MISTER CIGNA RALLY CAN MAYBE

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.038 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THIS EVEN A LITTLE

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:56.674 region:rollup2
BIT MORE.

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:58.142 region:rollup2
YES ON ESSENTIALLY THE DEBRIS

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:59.577 region:rollup2
GETS REMOVED THREE TO FOUR

00:42:58.142 --> 00:43:01.779 region:rollup2
MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD AFTER THE

00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:03.548 region:rollup2
DISASTER RIGHT AND SO IT WOULD

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:05.082 region:rollup2
BE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS. PLUS

00:43:03.548 --> 00:43:06.784 region:rollup2
THE SIX MONTHS SO LET'S SAY IT'S

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:08.119 region:rollup2
FOR EVEN FIVE MONTHS DOWN THE

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:09.020 region:rollup2
ROAD PLUS THE SIX MONTH THAT'S

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:10.888 region:rollup2
ELEVEN MONTHS.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:13.057 region:rollup2
.

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:15.126 region:rollup2
SO AT A MINIMUM IT'S REDUCE THIS

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.693 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD REDUCE THE TIME FRAME

00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:17.862 region:rollup2
FROM THE CURRENT TWENTY FOUR

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:18.963 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

00:43:17.862 --> 00:43:20.698 region:rollup2
TO TWELFTH TWO ELEVEN TWELVE

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:22.033 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:23.601 region:rollup2
AND IN ADDITION THAT TWENTY FOUR

00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:25.036 region:rollup2
MONTHS IS.

00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:26.537 region:rollup2
AFTER THE FIRST ACTUAL CASH

00:43:25.036 --> 00:43:28.473 region:rollup2
VALUE PAYMENT IS MADE WHICH IS

00:43:26.537 --> 00:43:30.908 region:rollup2
USUALLY SIXTY DAYS DOWN THE ROAD

00:43:28.473 --> 00:43:32.510 region:rollup2
FROM THE DISASTER SO TECHNICALLY

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:33.878 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE'S ABOUT

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:36.547 region:rollup2
A TWENTY SIX MONTH PERIOD OF

00:43:33.878 --> 00:43:37.782 region:rollup2
TIME. FOR THE INSURER TO SUBMIT

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:38.950 region:rollup2
THE CLAIM TO THE INSURANCE

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.851 region:rollup2
COMPANY AND STILL RECEIVE THE

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.119 region:rollup2
FULL BENEFIT OF THE INSURANCE

00:43:39.851 --> 00:43:42.753 region:rollup2
POLICY

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:44.655 region:rollup2
SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMONA IT

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:45.423 region:rollup2
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERE. THERE'S

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:47.091 region:rollup2
DEFINITE SOME ROOM THAT YOU

00:43:45.423 --> 00:43:48.526 region:rollup2
COULD.

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:50.228 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED DON'T WORK ON HERE

00:43:48.526 --> 00:43:51.929 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHERS

00:43:50.228 --> 00:43:52.864 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE TIME. RIGHT AND THAT'S

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:54.265 region:rollup2
OUR HOPE AND JUST TO GIVE AN

00:43:52.864 --> 00:43:55.733 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IN LAKE COUNTY FOR THE

00:43:54.265 --> 00:43:57.535 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FIRES IT

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:59.170 region:rollup2
TOOK THEM ENTIRE TWO YEARS EVERY

00:43:57.535 --> 00:44:00.671 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN A DIFFERENT SPACE.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.906 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THAT

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:03.841 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

00:44:01.906 --> 00:44:05.276 region:rollup2
AND THE DEBRIS I THINK THAT YOU

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:06.444 region:rollup2
KNOW I HAD A A COLLEAGUE TO COME

00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:08.679 region:rollup2
TO MY DISTRICT IN JUST A COUPLE

00:44:06.444 --> 00:44:10.281 region:rollup2
WEEKS AGO. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:12.083 region:rollup2
MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DEBRIS WE'RE

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:14.385 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT GOLDEN GATE YELL

00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:16.053 region:rollup2
SIZE FULL OF DEBRIS SO IT'S IT'S

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:17.488 region:rollup2
A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED PROCESS

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:19.457 region:rollup2
AND I THINK HAVING HAD A COUNTY

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:22.026 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AND THAT TOOK

00:44:19.457 --> 00:44:23.294 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE TWO YEARS I'D TO BE

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:24.562 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO THAT I THINK EIGHT AT

00:44:23.294 --> 00:44:26.230 region:rollup2
IT LENDS A CASE FOR REALLY

00:44:24.562 --> 00:44:28.132 region:rollup2
REEXAMINING THE SIX MONTH IS THE

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:31.169 region:rollup2
RIGHT. AMOUNT OF TIME I MEAN

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:32.603 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF MULTIPLE ISSUES

00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:34.005 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENED SO. OBVIOUSLY

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:35.273 region:rollup2

THAT.

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:41.512 region:rollup2
GOES THROUGH.

00:44:40.545 --> 00:44:42.947 region:rollup2
AND.

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:44.148 region:rollup2

ALLOWS INSURERS TO PERFORM A

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:52.095 region:rollup2
SURVEY IN A DIFFERENT

ALWAYS BEEN IF AN INSURANCE

COMPANY WANTS TO DO A SURVEY. AS

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:40.850 region:rollup2

FAIR AND REASONABLE.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:50.694 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:51.961 region:rollup2
THE BILL STILL DOES NOT QUITE.

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:53.496 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THOSE ISSUES THAT

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:55.131 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT NOW ARE

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:56.833 region:rollup2
JUST FOCUS ON ONE ISSUE I KNOW A

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:58.435 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED THE OF THE TIME

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.669 region:rollup2
FRAME BUT I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE

01:03:58.435 --> 01:04:00.570 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICAL ISSUE BECAUSE

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:02.305 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY THE MOST

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.640 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL IN THE MAJOR ISSUE

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:04.941 region:rollup2
HERE. AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.343 region:rollup2
OUTLINED IN THE.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:09.479 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:11.915 region:rollup2
SO THE GEOGRAPHICAL ISSUE.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:13.149 region:rollup2
DE AND I KNOW THE ASSEMBLY

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:14.417 region:rollup2
WOMAN IS TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:16.386 region:rollup2
TO INCLUDE.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:18.221 region:rollup2
THAT THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT BE

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:19.089 region:rollup2
IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA WE HAVE

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:21.324 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THAT.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:21.958 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL.

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:23.093 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS HAVE NOTHING

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:25.228 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH.

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:26.763 region:rollup2
THAT THE BODY SHOP'S OF MORE

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:28.531 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THE ASSEMBLY

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:30.734 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IS VERY LARGE

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.368 region:rollup2
IT INCLUDES A DIFFERENT CITIES

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:32.936 region:rollup2
AND DIFFERENT LOCAL MARKETS AND

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:35.438 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:38.174 region:rollup2
AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:39.809 region:rollup2
IT'S UNFAIR FOR CERTAIN SHOPS

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:41.578 region:rollup2
BODY SHOPS THAT ARE IN HIGH RENT

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:43.012 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:44.481 region:rollup2
OF OR MAYBE IN AN AREA IN THIS

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:46.416 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CITY THAT THEY HAVE

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:48.418 region:rollup2
TO PAY HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE TO BE

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:49.953 region:rollup2
COMPARED WITH OTHER SHOPS IN A

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:51.087 region:rollup2
LARGER AREA MAYBE THE COUNTY.

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:53.022 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LOWER THE RATES ARE

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:54.524 region:rollup2
CLEAR THE RENTS ARE LOWER SO

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:57.627 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU DO AN AVERAGE?

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:59.562 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SHOPS THAT?

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.097 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE LOW RENT DISTRICT

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.698 region:rollup2
ARE CHARGING LESS BUT IF YOU DO

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:03.433 region:rollup2
AN AVID THEY END UP GETTING A

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:05.869 region:rollup2
WINDFALL IN THE SHOPS THAT

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:08.338 region:rollup2
CHARGE MORE. END UP GETTING PAID

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:09.839 region:rollup2
LESS AND SO THAT IS THE DILEMMA

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:12.142 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE. THAT'S REALLY

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:13.276 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE WERE STRUGGLING WITH

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:16.012 region:rollup2
WE'VE ASKED FOR SOME SORT OF.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:17.781 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO AT LEAST COMPENSATE

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:19.649 region:rollup2
THE SHOP TO HAVE TO PAY MORE.

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:20.884 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC REASONS FOR

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:22.385 region:rollup2
HIGHER RENT AND THAT'S WHAT

01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:23.720 region:rollup2
WE'VE SORT OF WE'VE BEEN

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:26.489 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH WE BASS WERE

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.924 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR RANGE OF RATES MAYBE.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:30.693 region:rollup2
OF THAT ARE REASONABLE.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:31.428 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS THE STRUGGLE AND

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.862 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE REASON WHY WILL

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:35.432 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED TO THE

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:37.400 region:rollup2

IF NOT A MISS BURKE YOU CAN

01:06:29.786 --> 01:06:33.423 region:rollup2
CLOSE THINK YOU AYE IF YOU KNOW

01:06:31.855 --> 01:06:33.990 region:rollup2
JACK THAT WAS ACTUALLY VERY

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:34.991 region:rollup2
TEMPERATE SO I WANT TO THANK

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.726 region:rollup2

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.961 region:rollup2
FOR HIS. TEMPER HAVE A POSITION.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:38.528 region:rollup2
.

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:40.396 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:42.131 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AYE WE HAVE MET WE MET

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:43.266 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:44.434 region:rollup2
WE MET THE RECENTLY AND IT WAS

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:45.935 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:47.337 region:rollup2
AND WE CONTINUE TO WE LOOK FOR

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:48.905 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:50.106 region:rollup2
UP ON THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THE

01:06:48.905 --> 01:06:51.374 region:rollup2
REASON WE GIVE YOU THE DATE IS

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:53.209 region:rollup2
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS IT STANDS

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:54.310 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ONLY

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:56.012 region:rollup2
USES ABOUT TWENTY ONE TO THIRTY

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:58.381 region:rollup2
NINE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS EIGHTY

01:06:56.012 --> 01:07:00.483 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY MORE. SO THE AREAS

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:02.051 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SMALLER SO AND WE WILL

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:03.853 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK ON GEOGRAPHICAL

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:05.388 region:rollup2
AREAS ALSO I AS FAR AS

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:06.723 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING PRICE THE REASON WE

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:08.324 region:rollup2
NEVER DECIDED ON A RANGE WAS

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:08.892 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE PUT IN THE BILL THAT

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:10.894 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO MINIMUM AND NO

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:12.395 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM. THE IS THE STARTING

01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:13.796 region:rollup2
POINT AND THEN THEY NEGOTIATION

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.864 region:rollup2
AND FOR THAT MACHINE IS

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:16.633 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE'VE

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.334 region:rollup2
ADDRESS OUR ISSUES AND OTHER

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:19.669 region:rollup2
ACTUAL ISSUES IN THE BILL

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:22.171 region:rollup2
HOWEVER BECAUSE THERE IT'S AN

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:23.539 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL A FORM OF. COMING TO

THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE%

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:27.443 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT'S WHY

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.611 region:rollup2
THEY CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSE

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:31.981 region:rollup2

THIS BILL AS A VEHICLE FOR A

A TWO THIRDS VOTE HERE AYE IN

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:41.016 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND KAISER PERMANENTE

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.584 region:rollup2
JUST HAS TO FUNDAMENTALLY OBJECT

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:44.586 region:rollup2
TO ANY PROPOSAL THAT WOULD TAX

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:46.388 region:rollup2

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:59.101 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:23:57.065 --> 01:24:00.002 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN THE

01:23:59.101 --> 01:24:02.104 region:rollup2

THE BILL DOES AS FAR AS

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:09.491 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT. AND PREVENTION.

01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:12.127 region:rollup2
AND DOUG THEN YOU DIDN'T DRESS

01:27:09.491 --> 01:27:14.529 region:rollup2
IN MORE OF A CONVERSATION PIECE.

01:27:12.127 --> 01:27:16.598 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO GIVE ATTENTION TO

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:18.533 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF ASSESSMENT.

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:20.302 region:rollup2
AND THEN IN THE TESTIMONY OF

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:21.870 region:rollup2
THE SPONSOR.

01:27:20.302 --> 01:27:23.371 region:rollup2
YOU MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS

01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:25.273 region:rollup2
BILL IS SIMPLY OVERSIGHT AND

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:26.441 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:27.743 region:rollup2
AND HAD MENTIONED THAT

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:28.610 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT WOULD BE SOMETHING

01:27:27.743 --> 01:27:30.212 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:31.747 region:rollup2
DOWN THE ROAD.

01:27:30.212 --> 01:27:35.484 region:rollup2
SO IS THE BILL.

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:37.152 region:rollup2
IT IS THIS BILL ABOUT OVERSIGHT

01:27:35.484 --> 01:27:38.620 region:rollup2
AND PREVENTION I SEE IT AS A

01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:40.589 region:rollup2
THREE LEGGED STOOL ALL THREE OF

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.389 region:rollup2

TO BE ADDRESSED.

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:45.560 region:rollup2

01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:46.261 region:rollup2
THE BILL TODAY IS ONLY

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.729 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING WITH TO THOSE LEGS AN

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:50.298 region:rollup2
THAT'S OVERSIGHT AND PREVENTION

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:51.066 region:rollup2
AND NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:52.534 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT IS THAT RIGHT YOU'RE

01:27:51.066 --> 01:27:53.735 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:27:52.534 --> 01:27:54.035 region:rollup2
BUT SO IF IF THAT'S THE CASE

01:27:53.735 --> 01:27:57.038 region:rollup2
SPEAK.

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:58.039 region:rollup2

TAKE ON A LITTLE BIT TO TRY TO

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:42.784 region:rollup2
TO FIX A LARGER PROBLEM BUT THAT

01:28:41.216 --> 01:28:44.519 region:rollup2
IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS. IS

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:46.454 region:rollup2

WHERE IS THE INDUSTRY ITSELF

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:22.897 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WILL.

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:24.199 region:rollup2
.

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:25.533 region:rollup2
BUT YOU LOOK AT THE ALSO THE

01:33:24.199 --> 01:33:26.067 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR THIS

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:27.902 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND IF THEY DIE

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:29.170 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY.

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:29.804 region:rollup2
CUT BACK ITS ABSORBED BY THE

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:31.272 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANY AND I GET THAT

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:33.908 region:rollup2
IS OF VALUE.

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:35.743 region:rollup2
SO THE WORKS BOTH WAYS AND SOME

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:36.744 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR DEBT. YOU WORKING

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:38.246 region:rollup2
WITH INDUSTRY AND AND I

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:39.647 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE AGAIN YOUR PERSONAL

01:33:38.246 --> 01:33:41.149 region:rollup2
INTERESTS ARE AS A FORMER

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:43.518 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER. YOU KNOW I WANT THOSE

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:44.519 region:rollup2
PROTECT.

01:33:43.518 --> 01:33:46.120 region:rollup2
NOW YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:33:44.519 --> 01:33:47.322 region:rollup2
COMMENTS IT AGAIN YOU AT THAT

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.790 region:rollup2
ISN'T IN THE BILL AND SO I AND I

01:33:47.322 --> 01:33:50.191 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ONCE

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:51.493 region:rollup2
THAT PEACE IS THERE. BUT AGAIN

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:52.393 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHY WE PUT WE THAT'S

01:33:51.493 --> 01:33:53.895 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DID PUT THE PIECE IN

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:56.064 region:rollup2
THERE BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:33:53.895 --> 01:33:57.198 region:rollup2
REACH CONSENSUS ON ON THE O.

01:33:56.064 --> 01:33:57.799 region:rollup2
OVERALL AGREEMENT IF THAT'S

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:58.333 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:33:57.799 --> 01:33:59.801 region:rollup2
DO.

01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:03.771 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS

01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:04.405 region:rollup2
BILL ULTIMATELY DIES AND AGAIN.

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:05.940 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA COME BACK HERE AND

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:07.542 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO TO HEALTH THE HEALTH.

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.943 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ULTIMATELY IF THAT

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:10.411 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT IS IS PLACED IN AND

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:12.947 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:14.516 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHY.

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:17.118 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FIRST WE GOT EVERY

01:34:14.516 --> 01:34:18.353 region:rollup2
STATE HAS THEIR OWN GUARANTEED.

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:19.921 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION THAT PLAN THAT THEY

01:34:18.353 --> 01:34:20.522 region:rollup2
THAT THEY MANAGE

01:34:19.921 --> 01:34:21.656 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT

01:34:20.522 --> 01:34:23.324 region:rollup2
THAT THEY LEASE REPORT BACK TO

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:24.392 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT WE

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:25.760 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE AN

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:27.562 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO REPAY.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.864 region:rollup2
OR TO PAY FOR THE THINGS THAT

01:34:27.562 --> 01:34:31.366 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO PAY FOR A ONCE IN

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:32.667 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN INSOLVENCY.

01:34:31.366 --> 01:34:34.702 region:rollup2
THE MEMBER COMPANIES ONLY PAY IF

01:34:32.667 --> 01:34:36.671 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN INSOLVENCY ARE WE

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:38.039 region:rollup2
CAN TALK ABOUT UNDER THE ACA.

01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:38.973 region:rollup2
WHETHER ALL INSURANCE RETREAT

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:40.208 region:rollup2
INSURERS ARE TREATED THE SAME OR

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:41.509 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:42.911 region:rollup2
SIGN UP FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:44.579 region:rollup2
ACT YOU GO ONLINE. IT DOESN'T

01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:46.014 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE IT'S EITHER

01:34:44.579 --> 01:34:47.148 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE THAT MEANS THERE IS

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:48.850 region:rollup2
NO DIFFERENTIATION TO PICK A

01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:50.018 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT IS YOUR INSURANCE SO

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:50.985 region:rollup2
WE CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE ALL DAY

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:52.387 region:rollup2
LONG. UP BUT THERE USED TO BE

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:53.855 region:rollup2
OVER A HUNDRED PROVIDERS OF LONG

01:34:52.387 --> 01:34:54.956 region:rollup2
TERM CARE INSURANCE NOW WE'RE

01:34:53.855 --> 01:34:56.357 region:rollup2
DOWN TO TWELVE PROBABLY ELEVEN

01:34:54.956 --> 01:34:57.392 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BECAUSE PENN TREATY

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:58.359 region:rollup2
WENT OUT OF BUSINESS AND THAT'S

01:34:57.392 --> 01:34:59.127 region:rollup2
WHY IT'S SO EXPENSIVE BECAUSE

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:00.862 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:34:59.127 --> 01:35:02.397 region:rollup2
THERE. SO WE REALLY ARE

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:04.098 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT UPON THESE FEW

01:35:02.397 --> 01:35:05.767 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS YOU KNOW SIX OR SEVEN

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:07.368 region:rollup2
MAYBE EIGHT LARGE PROVIDERS IN

01:35:05.767 --> 01:35:09.470 region:rollup2
THE REST PRETTY SMALL. OF OF

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:11.139 region:rollup2
MANAGING THEIR MONEY WELL AND

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:12.073 region:rollup2
MANAGING THEIR POLICIES WELL SO

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:14.475 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS.

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:16.010 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY THERE AND SO TO

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:17.478 region:rollup2
REPORT BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.780 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IS IMPORTANCE OF A

01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:20.815 region:rollup2
FROM MANAGERIAL AND PROTECTION

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:21.349 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT AND ALSO TO REPORT

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:22.250 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:35:21.349 --> 01:35:23.351 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:25.153 region:rollup2
GETS ALSO GETS CLICK AT THE

01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:26.988 region:rollup2
ABILITY FOR THOSE CONSUMERS THAT

01:35:25.153 --> 01:35:28.790 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO TAKE ON DUE TO THE

01:35:26.988 --> 01:35:32.126 region:rollup2
INSOLVENCY. THEY MEET IT'S THAT

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:32.760 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF MRS WILSON IS

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:32.994 region:rollup2
PROBABLY PAYING TWELVE DOLLARS A

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.861 region:rollup2
MONTH.

01:35:32.994 --> 01:35:35.630 region:rollup2
WELL MAYBE THAT'S A REASON WHY

01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:36.798 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT THAT BUSINESS WHEN

01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:38.967 region:rollup2
INSOLVENT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T

01:35:36.798 --> 01:35:40.235 region:rollup2
CHARGING UP SO KLIEG AS A FIND A

01:35:38.967 --> 01:35:41.102 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED ASSOCIATION FUND

01:35:40.235 --> 01:35:42.604 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AN

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:43.871 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF SAYING OKAY. MAYBE

01:35:42.604 --> 01:35:45.173 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CHARGE A LITTLE BIT

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:46.674 region:rollup2
MORE SO I APOLOGIZE THAT YOUR

01:35:45.173 --> 01:35:47.976 region:rollup2
RATE IS GOING TO GO UP BUT IN

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:49.410 region:rollup2
ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT GUARANTEE

01:35:47.976 --> 01:35:50.478 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO CHARGE MORE. THE

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:52.380 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CAN

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:54.315 region:rollup2
STILL DECLINE THAT RATE INCREASE

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:55.416 region:rollup2
BUT THEY STILL HAVE THE ABILITY

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:56.918 region:rollup2
TO ASK IN THIS IS GIVING THEM

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:58.620 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ABILITY ASKING IT IS

01:35:56.918 --> 01:36:00.154 region:rollup2
ON US TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:01.389 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ONLY CHECKING WITH THE

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:02.457 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE BUT ALSO

01:36:01.389 --> 01:36:04.092 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE

01:36:02.457 --> 01:36:06.461 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE INSOLVENCY UP OR

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:07.862 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN HANDLE ARE. YOU

01:36:06.461 --> 01:36:09.264 region:rollup2
KNOW THEIR SITUATION AND THE

01:36:07.862 --> 01:36:10.231 region:rollup2
SITUATION OF EVERYBODY ELSE THAT

01:36:09.264 --> 01:36:11.532 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TAKING ON IN THE EVENT

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:12.767 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS AN INSOLVENCY DUE

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.868 region:rollup2
TO BAD ACTORS.

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:15.169 region:rollup2
A BUT I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:16.471 region:rollup2
SAYING AND AGAIN THAT'S RIGHT

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:17.939 region:rollup2
JUST NOT IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW

01:36:16.471 --> 01:36:19.540 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M. I ONCE

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:21.409 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED A BILL FOR TWO YEARS

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:22.510 region:rollup2
I KNEW I HAD THAT THE VOTES ON

01:36:21.409 --> 01:36:24.212 region:rollup2
THE FIRST GENERATION BECAUSE I

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:26.080 region:rollup2
CARE ABOUT CONSENSUS AND I CARE

01:36:24.212 --> 01:36:27.415 region:rollup2
ABOUT. REACHING THAT YOU KNOW

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.217 region:rollup2
COMMONSENSE

01:36:27.415 --> 01:36:30.918 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS EH TO THE BEST OF OUR

01:36:29.217 --> 01:36:31.953 region:rollup2
ABILITY SO I DON'T THINK ANY OF

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:33.921 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT MY

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:34.455 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO BE REASONABLE I TRY

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:37.492 region:rollup2
TO BE AS REASONABLE AS I

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:38.493 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY CAN. EVERYTIME UP SO

01:36:37.492 --> 01:36:40.261 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT I WILL

01:36:38.493 --> 01:36:40.828 region:rollup2
NEED I WILL I WILL CONTINUE WITH

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:42.030 region:rollup2
THESE CONVERSATIONS ON THAT

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:44.766 region:rollup2
SIDE.

01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:45.967 region:rollup2
IT OUT WITH GOOD INTENT AND

01:36:44.766 --> 01:36:46.467 region:rollup2
ONLY PUT IT IN THE BILL IF I

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:48.169 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE WE'VE WE SOME

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:49.270 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS.

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:50.471 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT AND KNOW

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:51.873 region:rollup2
ANYTIME AS A CONTRACTOR I TOOK

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:53.574 region:rollup2
RISK I HAD TO BOND.

01:36:51.873 --> 01:36:55.310 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO TO ASSURE MY EITHER

01:36:53.574 --> 01:36:57.111 region:rollup2
MY CLIENT OR OR THE AGENCY THAT

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:58.413 region:rollup2
I WAS WORKING FOR. THAT THAT WAS

01:36:57.111 --> 01:37:00.415 region:rollup2
THAT IF I COULD NOT.

01:36:58.413 --> 01:37:03.217 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THE PROJECT.

01:37:00.415 --> 01:37:05.953 region:rollup2
THE BOND WOULD COVER ALL COSTS.

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:07.455 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THE THE AGENCY THAT IS

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:09.324 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY VALVE

01:37:07.455 --> 01:37:10.692 region:rollup2
HAS SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE THAT

01:37:09.324 --> 01:37:12.694 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ALSO DO THAT OTHER THAN

01:37:10.692 --> 01:37:14.128 region:rollup2
GOING TO THE CONSUMER.

01:37:12.694 --> 01:37:14.896 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID HERE I'M I'M

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.864 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT PROP ONE OR

01:37:14.896 --> 01:37:18.433 region:rollup2
THREE ALSO WHEN INSURERS HAVE TO

01:37:16.864 --> 01:37:19.801 region:rollup2
GO BACK. SOMETIMES AND I'VE BEEN

01:37:18.433 --> 01:37:21.602 region:rollup2
TOLD THIS.

01:37:19.801 --> 01:37:22.837 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ONLY HAVE THEY GONE FOR

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:24.639 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE BUT THEY'VE RECEIVED

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:25.907 region:rollup2
A DEDUCTION.

01:37:24.639 --> 01:37:27.608 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE

01:37:25.907 --> 01:37:29.410 region:rollup2
OF AND SO THEY TAKE A RISK EVERY

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:31.212 region:rollup2
TIME THEY GO THROUGH FOR THAT

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:32.947 region:rollup2
RATE INCREASE SO I. I I I I I

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:34.082 region:rollup2
HAVE I'M HESITANT WHEN YOU TALK

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:35.817 region:rollup2
ABOUT GOING FOR AN INCREASE.

01:37:34.082 --> 01:37:38.419 region:rollup2
THE FATE THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:37:35.817 --> 01:37:40.054 region:rollup2
ALWAYS COME FORWARD AT LIGA.

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:41.522 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS THAT SPECIFICALLY THE

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:43.257 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED ASSOCIATION FUN NOT

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.859 region:rollup2
TO THE INSURANCE AT WORK TALK

01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:46.360 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS IS IS.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:48.196 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HIT HISTORY PREVAILS

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.030 region:rollup2
ITSELF HILL THROUGH OTHER

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:50.398 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT WE DON'T GIVE THE IF

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:52.467 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT CHANGING

01:37:50.398 --> 01:37:53.067 region:rollup2
THAT ON THE HEALTH UNDERSTOOD

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:54.135 region:rollup2
JUST SIMPLY NOT A GUARANTEED

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:54.802 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION ASIDE FOR THOSE

01:37:54.135 --> 01:37:58.206 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO

01:37:54.802 --> 01:38:00.575 region:rollup2
TAKE ON. ABSOLUTELY AND BASIC I

EXPLANATION FOR HOW YOU'RE

01:38:16.758 --> 01:38:20.528 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THE BILL. BECAUSE ON

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:22.296 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE THINGS

01:38:20.528 --> 01:38:25.900 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:25.900 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE.

01:38:25.967 --> 01:38:29.103 region:rollup2
ASSURANCE THAT.

01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:31.272 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE DONE IN A WAY THAT.

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:32.807 region:rollup2
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY EITHER

01:38:31.272 --> 01:38:34.442 region:rollup2
TO COME BACK OR THAT YOU'RE

01:38:32.807 --> 01:38:37.044 region:rollup2

01:38:34.442 --> 01:38:38.546 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY IN THAT. IT WILL BE ON

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:40.414 region:rollup2
A GOOD PROCESS SO I'M I'M

01:38:38.546 --> 01:38:41.916 region:rollup2
PREPARED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL ON

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:44.919 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL.

01:38:41.916 --> 01:38:47.088 region:rollup2
I I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THE

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:48.623 region:rollup2
LACK OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE

01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:50.191 region:rollup2
TO BUY INTO LONG LONG TERM CARE.

01:38:48.623 --> 01:38:51.793 region:rollup2
UP MY MOTHER HAS ALZHEIMER'S AND

01:38:50.191 --> 01:38:53.761 region:rollup2
SHE'S USING LONG TERM CARE AND

01:38:51.793 --> 01:38:55.062 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY UP WITHOUT IT

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:56.364 region:rollup2
SHE'D BE SELLING OFF ALL HER

01:38:55.062 --> 01:38:58.332 region:rollup2
ASSETS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

01:38:56.364 --> 01:39:00.067 region:rollup2
PROVIDE FOR HER CARE. AND WE MAY

01:38:58.332 --> 01:39:01.636 region:rollup2
GET THERE WHEN IT WHEN IT IF AND

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:03.638 region:rollup2
WHEN THE LONG TERM CARE ENDS BUT

01:39:01.636 --> 01:39:06.474 region:rollup2
I. LOOK AT THAT MY FATHER WAS

01:39:03.638 --> 01:39:08.709 region:rollup2
VERY WISE IN BUYING THE POLICY.

01:39:06.474 --> 01:39:10.912 region:rollup2
AND MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:14.148 region:rollup2
VERY UNWISE AND NOT. BUYING A

01:39:10.912 --> 01:39:14.715 region:rollup2
POLICY AND SO ON I THINK WE'RE

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:16.651 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:18.052 region:rollup2
TSUNAMI OF OF SENIORS GETTING TO

01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:18.252 region:rollup2
THE POINT WHERE THEY MAY NEED IT

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:20.154 region:rollup2
AND.

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:21.722 region:rollup2
AND TO HAVE IT AVAILABLE IS

01:39:20.154 --> 01:39:23.291 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT BE

01:39:21.722 --> 01:39:24.592 region:rollup2
SOLVENT ISRAELI IMPORTANCE I

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:25.960 region:rollup2

AND I'M AYE AYE MOVE I MEAN I

MOVE THE BELL BUT I. I DO WANT

01:39:27.562 --> 01:39:30.798 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT I'M CONCERNED WITH

01:39:28.596 --> 01:39:31.098 region:rollup2
THE SECOND PART OF IT AND IF YOU

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:33.201 region:rollup2
GET THERE.

01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:34.702 region:rollup2
AND CAN WORK IT OUT THAT WOULD

01:39:33.201 --> 01:39:37.939 region:rollup2
BE TERRIFIC TO.

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:38.940 region:rollup2
MISTER COOLEY.

01:39:37.939 --> 01:39:39.540 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:41.476 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.510 region:rollup2
I.

01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:44.212 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE TO

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:45.847 region:rollup2
THE SUBSTANCE OF IT.

01:39:44.212 --> 01:39:47.915 region:rollup2
AND I SORT OF FEEL LIKE WELCOME

01:39:45.847 --> 01:39:49.383 region:rollup2
TO LAW MAKING FOR ALL OF US.

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:50.284 region:rollup2
THIS BILL INVOLVES THE GUARANTEE

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:52.653 region:rollup2
FUND.

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:54.255 region:rollup2
THE BASIC

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:55.590 region:rollup2
FUNCTION OF OUR INSURANCE SYSTEM

01:39:54.255 --> 01:39:56.157 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH HERE

01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:57.158 region:rollup2
IS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE

01:39:56.157 --> 01:39:59.160 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:59.727 region:rollup2
FOR PROMISES BEING PAID IN EVERY

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.163 region:rollup2
INSTANCE IS THE RATES BEING

01:39:59.727 --> 01:40:02.763 region:rollup2
PAID.

01:40:02.163 --> 01:40:04.832 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE GUARANTEE FUND IS

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:06.334 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE RATES.

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:07.935 region:rollup2
THEN AND MAKE IN EVENT THAT FOR

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:09.570 region:rollup2
SOME REASON RATES.

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:10.771 region:rollup2
PROVIDE REVENUES INSURANCE COVER

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:12.673 region:rollup2
NOT ADEQUATE SO THEY END UP

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:13.407 region:rollup2
GOING INSOLVENT.

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:15.843 region:rollup2
THE SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE IS

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:17.144 region:rollup2
ALWAYS THE GUARANTEE FUND.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:19.347 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT'S A BIG POLICY

01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:20.915 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY CHOICE.

01:40:19.347 --> 01:40:22.717 region:rollup2
THAT'S TRUE IN THE NDIVIDUAL.

01:40:20.915 --> 01:40:23.885 region:rollup2
GETTING SCREWED BECAUSE THE

01:40:22.717 --> 01:40:25.586 region:rollup2
COMPANY WENT BANKRUPT THERE CAME

01:40:23.885 --> 01:40:26.621 region:rollup2
CAN'T GET PAID.

01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:28.556 region:rollup2
WE SOCIALIZE AT COST TO

01:40:26.621 --> 01:40:30.024 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE FUND.

01:40:28.556 --> 01:40:31.392 region:rollup2
THE COST CONTRIBUTED.

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:32.960 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE IN THIS ERA AS THE

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:35.162 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.898 region:rollup2
WALK US THROUGH. THE LEGACY

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:38.833 region:rollup2
SYSTEM EARLY RATES FOR LONG TERM

01:40:36.898 --> 01:40:40.701 region:rollup2
CARE WERE OPTIMISTIC.

01:40:38.833 --> 01:40:42.203 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF IT'S AN

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:43.237 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE TYPE OF COVERAGE.

01:40:42.203 --> 01:40:44.939 region:rollup2
PEOPLE LIVING LONGER WHICH IS

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:45.439 region:rollup2
GREAT FOR THEM.

01:40:44.939 --> 01:40:46.641 region:rollup2
BUT IT AFFECTS YOUR LIFE

01:40:45.439 --> 01:40:48.075 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS.

01:40:46.641 --> 01:40:49.610 region:rollup2
SO WE NOW HAVE AN INSURANCE

01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:51.145 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE THERE ARE RISKS TO

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:52.413 region:rollup2
INSOLVENCY.

01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:54.615 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN WHAT'S AMERICAN

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:55.216 region:rollup2
SOLUTION WE TRY TO CONCEPTUALIZE

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:56.584 region:rollup2
A GUARANTEE FUND A WAY TO DEAL

01:40:55.216 --> 01:40:57.552 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

01:40:56.584 --> 01:41:00.054 region:rollup2
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT.

01:40:57.552 --> 01:41:01.088 region:rollup2
.

01:41:00.054 --> 01:41:02.690 region:rollup2
THE STATEOF THE LAW GENERALLY

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:04.492 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA'S GOES BACK QUITE

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:05.493 region:rollup2
A WAYS IS THAT.

01:41:04.492 --> 01:41:05.993 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:41:05.493 --> 01:41:07.228 region:rollup2
WHICH MAY PROVIDE HEALTH

01:41:05.993 --> 01:41:09.096 region:rollup2
BENEFITS

01:41:07.228 --> 01:41:10.331 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE HEALTH PLANS

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:12.300 region:rollup2
THE DRUGS ARE THE PART A MATCH

01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:12.867 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE. THAT SHE TWO

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.669 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENTITIES UNDER OUR

01:41:12.867 --> 01:41:15.870 region:rollup2
LAW.

01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:17.171 region:rollup2
SO WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE

01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:18.573 region:rollup2
CONCERN BEING EXPRESSED BY.

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:20.474 region:rollup2
KAISER MOLINA.

01:41:18.573 --> 01:41:21.108 region:rollup2
LARA AND OTHERS

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:22.710 region:rollup2
THEY ARE IN A DIFFERENT BODY OF

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:24.245 region:rollup2
LAW.

01:41:22.710 --> 01:41:25.579 region:rollup2
SO IT ENDS UP FALLING INTO OUR

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:27.114 region:rollup2
LACK TO KIND OF GRAPPLE WITH

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:28.482 region:rollup2
THIS HOW DO WE PUT.

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:30.584 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE? HAVE A SYSTEM THAT

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:31.686 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS.

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:32.987 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING THE BURDEN OF

01:41:31.686 --> 01:41:34.588 region:rollup2
INSOLVENT COMPANY FALL SINGLE IN

01:41:32.987 --> 01:41:34.755 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL.

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:36.524 region:rollup2
AND.

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:37.858 region:rollup2
.

01:41:36.524 --> 01:41:39.627 region:rollup2
SO I ACTUALLY FEEL IT'S OF VERY

01:41:37.858 --> 01:41:40.728 region:rollup2
APT BILL FOR MAJORITY LEADER TO

01:41:39.627 --> 01:41:41.228 region:rollup2
BE TRYING TO ADVANCE A

01:41:40.728 --> 01:41:42.797 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION TO BRING IT

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:43.798 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:41:42.797 --> 01:41:44.865 region:rollup2
TO ENGAGE ASSAULT.

01:41:43.798 --> 01:41:47.535 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:48.169 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:41:47.535 --> 01:41:49.136 region:rollup2
ON THIS SORT OF THING I ALWAYS

01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:49.937 region:rollup2
THINK OF A SERMON I HEARD WHEN I

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:52.406 region:rollup2
WAS EIGHTEEN.

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:53.207 region:rollup2
I.

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:54.475 region:rollup2
CREATURE CUENTA CHURCH US

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:56.377 region:rollup2
ANYMORE AND PRIESTS A SERMON

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:57.778 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SEVEN LAST WORDS IN

01:41:56.377 --> 01:41:59.380 region:rollup2
THIS CASE OF THE CHURCH.

01:41:57.778 --> 01:42:00.147 region:rollup2
THE SEVEN LAST WORDS WERE THE

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.615 region:rollup2
LAST SEVEN THINGS OUR CHURCH

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:04.018 region:rollup2
WILL SAY.

01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:04.819 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT'S GONE FOREVER.

01:42:04.018 --> 01:42:06.253 region:rollup2
TURNED OUT THE SEVEN LAST WORDS

01:42:04.819 --> 01:42:11.359 region:rollup2
OF THE CHURCHES WE'VE NEVER DONE

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:12.026 region:rollup2
IT THAT WAY BEFORE.

01:42:11.359 --> 01:42:13.661 region:rollup2
AND SO WE DID IF WE ADOPTED THE

01:42:12.026 --> 01:42:14.228 region:rollup2
FACE OF CHALLENGING ISSUES THIS

01:42:13.661 --> 01:42:15.830 region:rollup2
DANCE WITH GOV DOT THAT WAY

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:16.631 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:19.300 region:rollup2
THEN WERE FOR A DEADLOCK.

01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:21.168 region:rollup2
SO AS I SAY.

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:24.472 region:rollup2
A GOOD BILL NOT AN EASY BILL I

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:25.439 region:rollup2
SEE THAT THE ARGUMENT WHAT THE

01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:26.040 region:rollup2
HOME BUT THAT INVOLVES WE

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:27.341 region:rollup2
GENERATE OUR LAW.

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.508 region:rollup2
IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY.

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:29.510 region:rollup2
AND.

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:30.578 region:rollup2
.

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:31.979 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S NOT SO THAT CAN HAPPEN

01:42:30.578 --> 01:42:32.480 region:rollup2
IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:34.081 region:rollup2
WILL NEED TO BE A LOT OF

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.317 region:rollup2
SCRUTINY.

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:37.985 region:rollup2
I. AND IT DOES FIT WITHIN THAT

01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:39.620 region:rollup2
GENERAL NATIONAL CONVERSATION

01:42:37.985 --> 01:42:40.221 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE KEEP THE BURDEN OF A

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:42.156 region:rollup2
FAILED COMPANY FALLING ON THE

01:42:40.221 --> 01:42:43.190 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL.

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:45.559 region:rollup2

HAVE ONE NOW AT FORTY ONE. AND

01:45:44.638 --> 01:45:48.008 region:rollup2
