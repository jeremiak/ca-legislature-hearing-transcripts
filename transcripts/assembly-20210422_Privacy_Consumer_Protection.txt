IT'S CANNELLA NAY OF MISTRUST RADIO IS IT OKAY IF I CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU AFTER WE'VE HAD A DISCUSSION HERE- WITHIN OURSELVES PLEASE DO THAT'LL GIVE US TIME TO. PICTUS QUESTIONING SO MUCH THE CASE AND LET'S CELEBRATE TO OURCOMMUNITY MR CAN'T GO HAD QUESTIONS COMMENT. YEAH I. SUPPORT THE- I THINK THE VOTERS SHOULD A CHANCE TO. WHETHER IT'S WORTH- TAKING ON SOME BOND DEBT FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THIS NATURE- I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE CONCERN RAISED BY CC TA- BECAUSE AT IS AS UP AS I READ IT IT LOOKS LIKE. DEFINITION ONLY- GROUPS THAT ARE CONSIDERED QUOTE UNQUOTE UNSERVED AND GROUPS ARE CONSIDERED QUOTE UNQUOTE- AREAS NOT GROUPS- QUOTE UNQUOTE DISADVANTAGE OR SORT OF LUMPED TOGETHER- I'VE SEEN THE CHARTS ON WHERE BROADBAND ACCESS IS AT ITS BIGGEST DEFICIT ANDS PREDOMINATELY RURAL PARTICULARLY VERY RURAL AREAS- ALSO SOME CITIES IN MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY AS WELL- I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHAT. WHETHER THERE'S OPENNESS TO MAYBE TIGHTENING UP THOSE DEFINITIONS OR DOING. SOME SORT OF DIFFERENT THING DEFINITIONAL LEASE OF THE WE KNOW THE MONEY'S GOING TO. AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE THIS STUFF DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOT GOING TO MAYBE REDUNDANCIES IN PLACES THAT ARE ALREADY SERVED BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIONAL THING. SO LET'S ALL START BY SAYING THAT- I KNOW THAT IF FOR THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR WAS HERE HE WOULD MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT HIS GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT UNSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE PLACES LIKE THE ONES THAT BOTH YOU AND I REPRESENT- VERY DIFFERENT IN THEIR AREAS THAT HE REPRESENTS A REDONDO BEACH. AT THAT ARIAS ARE HIS PRIORITY AND I KNOW THAT HE CONTINUES IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OPPOSITION- TO TRY TO CLARIFY THOSE DEFINITIONS IN THIS BUILDING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAS COME UP AS A POINT OF CONTENTION AND DEBATE. WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN WHO DOES THAT REALLY ENCOMPASS. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SOME ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT DEFINITION. I SHOULD BE UTILIZED SO THAT WE'RE NOT EXCLUDING OUT FOLKS FROM THE ABILITY TO EITHER ADDRESS THE UNSERVED. COMPONENT OR IN SOME CASES THE UNDERSERVED WHERE THEIR NEEDS ARE NOT SO MUCH ABOUT BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE PER SE BUT TO INCREASE. CAPACITY AND SPEED RIGHT SO I THINK HE IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS BUT I WILL START. I WILL REITERATE AGAIN THAT IF HE WAS HERE HE WOULD BE SAYING TO YOU TO ME. I AM TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR AREAS- GET THE INVESTMENT BEFORE AREAS LIKE MINE IN THE IN THE HIS CASE. AT REDONDO BEACH- GET THE PRIORITIZATION FIRST SO I'LL- STOP THERE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE'S GOOD FAITH- EFFORT TO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT. I THINK I THINK THAT'S A GREAT ANSWER ACTUALLY LIKE YOUR IDEA OF MAYBE DEFINING IT AS- UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED THAT MIGHT BE SORT OF A CLEANER. MAYBE WAY TO DO IT JUST. SOMETHING FOR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR. GREAT THANK YOU. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED DOUBT LET ME CIRCLE BACK TO THE OPERATOR TO SEE IF I ANYONE ELSE IS STILL ON THE QUEUE THERE. MIZRAAB WRITER ON. HOW WE LOOKING SO FAR.

NOW BEING THAT BEING SAID GOING FORWARD I AM INTERESTED TO HEAR MORE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR ANALYSIS OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF- SB THIRTY FOUR THAT'S GOING TO BE ASSIGNED TO THEM. I ALSO WANNA NOTE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND SPEND RESOURCES WISELY AND I DO ENCOURAGED ALL OF THE AUTHORS TO CONTINUE ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE VOTERS ARE PRESENTED WITH A SOLID PLAN. THAT WILL BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS SO WITHOUT DOUBT PLEASE GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR UP FOR THE QUESTIONS THIS PANDEMIC IS HIGHLIGHTED ENORMOUS DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE RELIABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET. SPECIALLY IN. RURAL AND LOW INCOME. COMMUNITIES AS THE INNOVATION STATE CAL. SHOULD LEAD BY. INCREASING ITS INVEST OF POP. BROADBAND AND FOR. CALIFORNIA MUST INVEST FOR FUTURE. AND MEET THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS I WILL JUST SAY. MIKE MY PIECES- WE CANNOT- WAIT ANY LONGER.

AND YET DOES SO BUT I DO SEE MISTER BLOOM SO MR BLOOM WHICH LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. AND THAT WOULD BE ITEM NUMBER THREE. AB NINE ONE SEVEN. AND WELCOME TO OUR MEETINGS TO BLOOM THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB NINE SEVENTEEN WILL ALLOW TRANSIT AGENCIES TO CAPTURE IMAGES OF VEHICLES WHO ARE VIOLATING TRANSIT ONLY LANES AND BLOCKING BUS STOPS. DESPITE CLEAR MARKINGS AND SIGNAGE TRANSIT ONLY LANES ARE FREQUENTLY IGNORED UNFORTUNATELY. FOR EXAMPLE FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF WILSHIRE BOULEVARD IN WEST LOS ANGELES AND MY DISTRICT FOUND ONE VIOLATION EVERY FOUR MINUTES. PLUS ONLY LANE VIOLATIONS OF PARKED VEHICLES FORCED TRANSIT OPERATORS TO MANEUVER AROUND CONGESTED LANES AND MAKE DROP OFFS FURTHER FROM THE CURB. THIS REDUCES EFFICIENCY AND POSES SAFETY ISSUES. TO COMBAT THESE VIOLATIONS AND- THE AND- SAFETY ISSUES THAT ARE ANCHORED SAN FRANCISCO ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED CAMERA ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS. FORWARD FACING CAMERAS ARE ATTACHED TO THE BUSES AND ONLY RECORD LICENSE PLATES OF VEHICLES THAT ARE BLOCKING BUS LANES IMAGES ARE THEN SENT TO THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO REVIEW AND ISSUE A CITATION. IN THE PILOT PHASE SAN FRANCISCO SHOWED A 20% REDUCTION IN DELAYS AND EVEN FEWER REPEAT CITATIONS IN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AC TRANSIT SAW A PERFORMANCE. AB NINE SEVENTEEN HAS NUMEROUS GUARDRAILS FOR CONSUMER AND PRIVACY PROTECTIONS NEW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS MUST GIVE NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC IN ISSUE ONLY WARNING NOTICES FOR THIRTY DAYS BEFORE FULL IMPLEMENTATION. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES IMAGES TO BE DISPOSED OF SIXTY DAYS AFTER THE CITATION HAS BEEN FINALIZED. IMAGES CAN BE RETAIN NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS FROM THE DATE THEY WERE FIRST TAKEN AND IMAGES THAT DO NOT SHOW VIOLATE. RIGHT NOW IN FIFTEEN DAYS. THESE IMAGES CAN ONLY BE USED FOR PURPOSES OF PARKING ENFORCEMENT NOTHING ELSE AB NINE SEVENTEEN WILL PROVIDE RIDERS WITH ACCESS TO SAFE AND RAPID BUS SERVICE AND ENSURE PUBLIC TRANSIT REMAINS COMPETITIVE IN ATTRACTING MORE RIDERS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO STRENGTHEN THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN AB NINE SEVENTEEN WE WILL AMEND THE BILL TO INCLUDE THE LANGUAGE NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS AB NINE SEVENTEEN HAS NO OPPOSITION AND WAS VOTED OUT OF ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AT LEAST I HOPE- PARK MICHAEL TURNER THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT LA METRO. AND STEPHENJONES WHO IS EXTERNAL AFFAIRS REPRESENTATIVE AC TRANSIT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP MISTER TURNER ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES I AM WELCOME INCREASE BEGIN. THANK YOU SHARON MEMBERS- AND THIS IS MICHAEL TURNER ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM FOR OFFERING THIS LEGISLATION AND THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ALL OF US TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL. AB NINE ONE SEVEN WOULD AUTHORIZE PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES TO INSTALL FRONT FACING CAMERAS TO OUR VEHICLES TO ASSIST WITH ENFORCEMENT OF PARKING VIOLATION IN TRANSIT ONLY LANES AND AT BUS STOPS WITH THIS AT THE ALREADY METRO AND OTHER AGENCIES CAN PARTNER WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ALREADY HAVE PARKING ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE WITNESSED METRO WOULD NOT BE ISSUING PARKING CITATIONS UNDER THIS PROGRAM WILL BE UTILIZING THE CITY'S EXISTING AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE PARKING ON THEIR STREET. AB NINE ONE SEVEN SIMPLY CREATES AN ADDITIONAL TOOL TO ASSIST IN THIS EFFORT TO KEEP BOTH PLANES CLEAR AND KEEP BUSES MOVING WE'RE SPONSORING AB NINE ONE SEVEN TO AUTHORIZE THE DEPLOYMENT OF A TRANSIT LANE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND CITY OF SANTA MONICA WHERE WE CURRENTLY OPERATE BUS LANES AND ALLOW FOR FUTURE EXPANSION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER CITIES. WE CURRENTLY OPERATE BUSES ON OVER TWENTY NINE MILES OF TRANSIT ONLY LANES AND THESE HELP TO SERVE THE TEN MILLION RESIDENTS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY ONE OF THE KEY IMPROVEMENTS WE EXPECT TO pRELIABILITY BUT I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE SAFETY ISSUE HERE ILLEGALLY PARKED CARS AND BUS LANES ARE A SAFETY HAZARD. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT EIGHTY WRITERS BUS OR DELAYED FOR EACH MINUTE GOT A CARS BLOCKING. A LANE. BIGELOW SOMETHING OTHER I WENT DOWN. WHERE THEY HELD PLEASE BE YOUR LINE THIS WITNESSES PLEASE ME TO I. THE NEW YORK WE'LL FIND OUT LINE OKAY I KNOW HAPPENED OKAY HE SAID. US REP UP QUICKLY- IS THIS ALL A SIMILAR A PRO.

YES SIR. PLEASE AHEAD THE WALK. THANK YOU THANK YOU- DO MORNING JONES EXTERNAL FOR AT EIGHT ENTRANCE SPEAKING INCOME OF A NINE SEVEN. AB SEVENTY BILL UPON EXIST LAW AND ALLOWS ALL CALIFORNIA TRANSIT AGENCIES TO USE CAMERAS MOUNTED ON TRANSIT VEHICLES TO DETER PEOPLE FROM PARKING AND TRANSIT ONLY LANES AND A TRANSIT STOPS. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS AC TRANSIT TO USE CAMERAS TO DISCOURAGE ILLEGAL PARKING IN THE TRANSIT ONLY LANES OF OUR NEW BUS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM. SHARES DEPUTIES REVIEW VIDEO IMAGES FLAGGED BY BUS OPERATORS AND ISSUE CITATIONS WHERE WARRANTED THE DATE WE'VE RECEIVED ZERO PRIVACY CAN- ON ALL REGULAR SERVICE- IT'S ALSO FREQUENTLY. WHEN VEHICLES PARKED IN BUS STOPS WHAT A BUS OPERATOR CAN'T REACH THE CURB WRITERS ARE THEN FORCED TO LOAD OR UNLOAD IN THE STREET FOR THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE THE LARGE GAP THAT'S CREATED BETWEEN THE BUS AND THE CURB. THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS MANEUVER FOR WRITERS TO MAKE- AND INTERNAL AND IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE ONE FOR THOSE WITH A DISABILITY OR MOBILITY ISSUES LIKE SENIORS. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN WILL HELP IMPROVE TRANSIT SYSTEM ACCESSIBILITY SAFETY AND RELIABILITY WHILE ADVANCING EQUITY FOR TRANSIT RIDERS I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT.

US EIGHT AND THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE- NECK WE HAVE FAR LET'S GO BACK TO NUMBER ONE OKAY HAVE THAT'S ITEM NUMBER AB THIRTEEN SO. SIX YES BACK TO YOUR- OKAY FINE. WELCOME ANYTIME YOU'RE TO PURSUE. THANK YOU TERM MEMBERS FOR I WANT TO THE AND HE STAFF WITH TIME ON THE IMPORTANT. AND FOR PROCESSING AGREED AMEND FROM THE PA SAFETY THAT REFLECT IN THE BILL YOU SEE TODAY. TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT A THIRTEEN FIFTY. AND THAT UPDATES ARE LAWSUIT. THE INSIDIOUS THREATS PATIENTS AND- AT A REPRESSED HEALTH IN. ARE FOR. ROBY WEIGHT IS THE- PEOPLE HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL TO SIX. REFERRED HEALTH CLINIC. WITHOUT THEIR- WELL BE. AND BEING VIOLATED WITHOUT THREAT. AND THE ASSAULTS THAT ARE COMING WITH SHOWING UP TO GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO. LAWS REGULATING SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLINE WERE LAST UPDATED IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS AND THE FACE ACT PROTECTING CLINICS IS WRITTEN IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. CENTS THEN PROTESTERS A CLINICS HAVE BECOME DRASTICALLY MORE EXTREME IN THEIR TACTICS AND POWERED BY ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY. PROTESTERS RETURNED DAY AFTER DAY HARASSING PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDER EGGS WEARING THEM DOWN MENTALLY AND OFTEN CONFRONTING THEM PHYSICALLY. NEW CAMERA VIDEO CAPABILITIES ALLOW THEM TO FILM PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS IN DETAIL. THEY POST THESE IMAGES ON WEBSITES WITH PROVIDERS PERSONAL INFORMATIONAL INFORMATION SEARCHABLE FOR MILLIONS OF USERS. THE ONLINE HARASSMENT AND DOXING THREATENS PATIENTS LIVES. CURRENT LAW IN THE FACE ACTORS NOT REFLECT THE SEVERITY OF THIS THREAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS DETERRED FROM MAKING ARRESTS POLICE ARE FRUSTRATED BY THE RELENTLESSNESS OF THESE GROUPS AND THEY LACK SUFFICIENT TRAINING TO ADDRESS THE FRAUGHT SITUATION. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. PRIVACY AND PHYSICAL SAFETY ARE PRE REQUISITES FOR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. ESPECIALLY REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WHEN A PATIENT FACES UNMITIGATED HARASSMENT IN THEIR MOST VULNERABLE MOMENT. THEY'RE BEING ROBBED OF THAT RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE OUR LAWS ARE FAILING TO PROTECT THEM. HARASSING IN PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DOCTORS CARRIED LOWER PENALTIES THAN DOG FIGHTING. LO FI AND MISDEMEANOR DO NOT TURKEY THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PAY DEFEND THEMSELVES SOMEHOW WE'VE ACCEPTED THE STATUS QUO THAT OVER PENALIZES MARIJUANA POSSESSION BELIEVES YOUNG WOMEN VICTIMS OF DEATH THREATS. SIMPLY FOR SEEKING HEALTH CARE. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX UPDATES ARE LOST TO INCREASE FINES FOR ONLINE HARASSMENT AND INTENTIONALLY TERRORIZING PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS.

IT'S PRESERVES THE RIGHT TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OR VIDEOS WHILE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE USING NORMAL PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT LIKE CELL PHONES. IT PROVIDES NO EXCEPTIONS FOR JOURNALISTIC WORK OR FOR EVEN FOR SELF DEFENSE EIGHTY THIRD THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX PROVIDES NO EXCEPTIONS. IT WILL MAKE IT A CRIME TO FILM A CRIME COMMITTED IN PUBLIC AGAINST PRO LIFE DEMONSTRATORS OUTSIDE ABORTION FACILITIES THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS ALONE OUR VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE SIMPLY HOLDING SIGNS. AND QUIETLY STANDING IN FRONT OF AN ABORTION FACILITY WERE THREATENED WITH A YARDSTICK AND THE NICE HELP COULD WITH RAW EGGS AND HAD THEIR SIGNS FORCIBLY RIPPED FROM THEIR HANDS. THIS BILL WOULD CRIMINALIZE THESE PEOPLE PROTESTERS FOR FILMING AND PUBLICIZING THESE ASSAULTS. COMMITTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY OCCURRED. IF THESE EVENTS HAPPENED ANYWHERE ELSE VICTIMS COULD FILM AND PUBLICIZE THE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR WE SEE THAT EVERY DAY MOST RECENTLY IN THE TRAGIC EXAMPLE OF GEORGE FLOYD.

ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR- ARE VICE CHAIR KILEY GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING- SOMEONE OUR OKAY AND I KNOW THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION SUBMITTED A LETTER OF OPPOSITION- BECAUSE THIS BILL RADICALLY INCREASES CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND- UNDULY INTERFERES WITH CIVIL LIBERTIES DO YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE STILL OPPOSED. THE I DO NOT DO NOT LEAVE A SUBMITTED ANOTHER LETTER I DO NOT KNOW AS MUCH OF OR DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE SILLIEST. I DO NOT- HOWEVER I WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ACLU TO- THAT WORK OUT LANGUAGE AND AMENDMENTS. IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THEIR OPPOSITION. I SEE WHAT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT POINT ABOUT INCREASING CRIMINAL PENALTIES NOT BEING THE ANSWER BECAUSE I HEAR THAT THAT ARGUMENT MADE A LOT IN THIS CAPITAL- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR POSITION IS BEEN ON THE VARIOUS OTHER BILLS WITH THAT'S COME UP- BUT YOU KNOW WHY IS THAT. THE ANSWER HERE WHEN IT'S NOT THE ANSWER OF WITH. ALL THESE OTHER CRIMES. YES THE PROVISION. I YEAH THAT'S JUST SO- I TAKE AN AWESOME PERSON THAT IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY. RECORD ON PUBLIC SAFETY- BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS A TIME AND PLACE TO LOOK AT INCREASED. PENALTIES AND INCREASED FINES ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE HEARING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK. THAT IF YOU ARE IN YOUR COMMUNITY BUT I KNOW IN MY COMMUNITY ARTISTS AND WE TALK ABOUT A LOT. OF IN PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE LEGISLATURE IS A LONG PERSON OFTEN SAYS IF IT'S A MISDEMEANOR IT'S NOT GOING TO CHARGE FOR THE DA AND- SO THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO AND SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS. ENSURE THAT THERE'S A RESPONSE THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO THESE THREATS AND VIOLENCE TO BE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND SO THAT'S WHY THESE ARE BEING INCREASED FOR MISDEMEANORS. THANK YOU. BILL THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED IN THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN MOVED SECONDED- OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING OH SORRY MR GALLAGHER GARCIA GO AHEAD I'M SORRY. YEAH JUST A COMMENT AYE AYE I DO THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT- A BILL MOVED OUT OF PUBLIC SAFETY THAT ACTUALLY TAKES THINGS FROM A MISDEMEANOR TO A FELONY BECAUSE AND MANY OTHER CASES THAT IS NOT BEEN THE CASE. I FIND IT IRONIC THAT WERE ALSO CONSIDERED IN THIS LEGISLATURE ABILITY TO- DECRIMINALIZING MAKE MISDEMEANORS. OR REDUCE THE CRIMINALITY OF ACTUAL ROBBERIES. WE'RE AS WE'RE TRYING TO CRIMINALIZE WHAT IS CLEARLY PROTECTED SPEECH. AND IT'S BEEN MADE VERY CLEAR UNDER THE SUPREME COURT- DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN ON THIS ISSUE- JUST LIKE- AB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE- FROM. WHAT FOUR YEARS AGO. IF THIS BILL PASSES ALONG TO ABSOLUTELY BE STRUCK DOWN AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL- AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN THESE COMMITTEES WERE IT WERE CONSIDER PEOPLE'S. RIGHTS WE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO PROCEED WITH BILLS THAT WE KNOW ARE ABSOLUTELY. NOT CONSTITUTIONAL BASED ON LAWS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN. STRUCK DOWN BY THE COURTS IN BY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN BY OUR HIGHEST COURT- SO I WOULD JUST REALLY ENCOURAGES COMMITTEE- TO NOT GET WRAPPED UP IN THE EMOTION MAYBE OF THIS ISSUE BUT ACTUALLY LOOK AT IT- FROM THE- PERSPECTIVE OF THE- OF THE CLEAR LAW ON THIS THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET THERE. AND ALMOST ALL THOSE- SITUATIONS ARE LIKELY GOING TO BE ON A PUBLIC STREET OR A PUBLIC SIDEWALK- ARE ABSOLUTELY LOUD TO VIDEOTAPE. AND I THINK THAT THE POINT THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IS A GOOD MORNING. WOULD YOU AND IN THE SAME CASE SAY THAT SOMEONE COULD VIDEOTAPE POLICE. ARRES OF THE CITIZEN. AND IF YOU IF YOU WOULD BE OPPOSED IF YOU WOULD ACTUALLY BE OPPOSED TO BANNING THAT RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO DO THAT HOW CAN YOU THEN BE OKAY WITH BANNING SOMEONE'S RIGHT TO DO IT IN THIS SITUATION. WE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT. THE LAW IS CONSISTENT. IT'S BEEN CONSIDERED AND WE SHOULD BE. ABIDING BY OUR OATH TO UPHOLD. THE CONSTITUTION AND THE CLEAR LAW THAT'S BEEN THAT IS COME DOWN AND IN IN THE STATE AND IN THIS NATION. ON THIS VERY ISSUE. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. MISS WHICH COULD HAVE. I WAS GONNA TALK BUT- YEAH JAMES HE PULLED ME IN- THIS BILL SUPPORT I WOULD FOR THIS BILL AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND I VOTED FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DEMONSTRATE AND PROTEST IN THIS ALSO ALLOWS FOR THAT. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO DO IS IF AS SOMEONE WHO WAS WALKED INTO A PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC TO GET AN ABORTION TO BE VIDEOTAPED WHILE I'M ENTERING THAT BUILDING TO HAVE THAT THEN. PLACED WHEREVER ON THE INTERNET AND THAT IS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY IN MY OPINION AND IT IS IN THOSE MOMENTS OF TIME WHEN WE NEED TO RESPECT A WOMAN'S. RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AT CENTER AND I THINK THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR. THE NECESSARY- OUR RIGHTS TO PROTEST DEMONSTRATE WHILE STILL WOMEN WHO. NEED THIS CARE AND ARE ENTITLED TO THIS HERE. SO I WILL. DEFINITELY BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR- QUESTIONS I BELIEVE ABOUT THE AUTHOR TO HAVE TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS IN PUBLIC SAFETY TO REDUCE THE CRIME SOIF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. SO SO WITH THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE MEASURE IS NARROWLY TAILORED AND- THERE IS A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTERESTS AND THAT WHICH I NOTE A DRAWS SO WITH THAT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLIP WHICH I COULD CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YES I AGREE WITH YOU AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS SOMETHING I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT I BELIEVE IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND ONE THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE WORKED TO MISTER KYLIE'S POINT WITH THE ACLU. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT BEING SAID AS THE LAWYERS ON THIS COMMITTEE NO TRUE THREATS ARE NOT PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THIS IS A NARROWLY TAILORED BILL THAT ENSURES THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THOSE THAT ARE SEEKING HEALTHCARE AND I KNOW EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTS HIT BY THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF PATIENCE. AND THE LAWS AROUND THAT AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY IS THE PRIVATE IN SURPRISE SEEN SECURITY OF WORKERS WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR JOB OF PATIENTS WHO ARE TRYING TO SEEK THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AND THEY HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ALL SUPPORT. PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE LAW ABIDING AND GOING ABOUT THEIR WAY AND ENSURE THAT THEIR FOR FROM US. AND BILE OF THE. KILEY NO PARA QUE HAN HI ARE QUE HAND I'VE DONE IT BENNETT I CARILLO. CUNNINGHAM GABRIEL GABRIEL I GALLAGHER GALLAGHER NO IRWIN- WHEN I LEE. LEE HIGHWAY SIX WICKS HI YOU HAVE SEVEN VOTES THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE HOUSE- C. HEALTH MINISTER. I THINK WE HAVE MISTER GRAYSON NEXT YES. WELCOME MR GRAYSON YOUR HOUSE ITEMS FOURTEEN AND THAT IS A. B. TEN EIGHTY NINE. YES PLEASE BEGIN GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS MOST OF THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS AND I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THE OTHERS AS THE BILL PROGRESSES. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU AB TEN EIGHTY NINE WHICH WILL UPDATE AND MODERNIZE THE CREDIT SERVICES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO EXPAND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHEN CONTRACTING WITH A CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATION ALSO KNOWN AS CSO. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A MEASURE THAT THE COMMITTEE SAW LAST YEAR WHICH PASSED THIS HOUSE UNANIMOUSLY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THE BILL DID NOT MOVE IN THE SENATE DUE TO THE TRUNCATED SESSION BECAUSE OF PROBITY. HAS POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS CREDIT REPAIR COMPANIES HAVE BEEN WIDELY CRITICIZED FOR ENGAGING IN UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE MARKETING AND BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FOR CHARGING HIGH FEES FOR SERVICES THAT CONSUMERS CAN OFTEN PERFORM THEMSELVES IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE SCRUTINY HAS COME FROM BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CONSUMER WATCHDOGS. AS SUCH IT IS CRITICAL TO ADVANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THIS AREA SINCE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND USE CREDIT HAS BECOME OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO CONSUMERS WHO HAVE A VITAL INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING THEIR CREDIT WORTHINESS AND CREDIT STANDING. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE STRONGEST CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE NATION FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE CSOS TO PROVIDE EVEN BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE SERVICES THEY WILL RENDER OR HAVE RENDERED HOW MUCH THE SERVICES ARE LIKELY TO COST WHEN THEY COMMUNICATE WITH THIRD PARTIES ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER OR A TIMELINE FOR WHEN THEIR SERVICES WILL BE COMPLETE. THIS IS WHY AB TEN EIGHTY THAT IS NEEDED TO ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY REQUIRING CSOS PATEL BECAUSE CONSUMERS WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO AND THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED. PROVIDE DID TAKE DETAILED MONTHLY STATEMENTS OF THE ACTIONS THE CSO HAS TAKEN. AND DISCLOSED TO CONSUMERS AND PROVIDE COPIES OF ALL COMMUNICATIONS SENT BY A SEE A SOUL ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT. THIS IS A SIMPLE MEASURE STRICTLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR A FOR WELL DOCUMENTED UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE MARKETING AND BUSINESS PRACTICES OF CSOS. I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES TODAY MISTER CHAIR TOM GRIFFIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS AND CINDY YACKTMAN WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF. COLLECTORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S START WITH MISTER GRIFFIN. ARE YOU ON THE LINE MISTER GRIFFIN. I AM ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME MR TRUMP YES PLEASE GO AHEAD.

BEGIN YOUR SUPPORT HERE TODAY AB TEN EIGHTY NINE SIX TO PROVIDE. RIGOBERTA ACTIONS AND GREATER TRANSPARENCY FOR CONSUMERS MAY DECIDE TO CONTACT. A CREDIT SERVICE ORGANIZATION- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND- OBVIOUSLY THE AUTHORS OFTEN WE HAVE AGREED TO TAKE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT WERE SUGGESTED. IN THE LAST DAY OR TWO. AS POINTED OUT IN AN HOUR WILL STATEMENT LAW PROVIDE A NUMBER OF PROTECTIONS TO CONSUMERS WHO SEEK THE SERVICES OF CSOS DESPITE THESE LAWS SOME CREDIT REPAIR COMPANIES TO OPERATE IN A WAY THAT- TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GLOBAL INDIVIDUALS AND OR VIOLATE THE LAW. BUT ALL WHERE SHE TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS TO FILL THE GAPS CONSUMER ARE ADDICT PROTECTED. I'M ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS.

YES GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME WITHIN THE AUCKLAND I'M CURRENTLY. THANKSGIVING SERVING AS THE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS AND I'M A SECOND GENERATION COLLECTION AGENCY OWNER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AB TEN EIGHTY NINE IS FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY OUR MEMBERS. IN ON BEHALF OF COLLECTION AGENCIES NATIONWIDE. CONSISTENTLY OUR MEMBERS HAVE REPORTED THAT CONSUMERS DID NOT ACTUALLY DISPUTE THE AMOUNT THE FINE. THEY INDICATE THE SIGNATURE IN A LETTER SENT BY THE DE ESTO IT'S NOT THEIR SIGNATURE. CONSUMERS HAVE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AND ANGER AT THEIR CREDIT SCORE DID NOT INCREASE AS THE CSO HAD REPRESENTED. THEY HAVE PAID FOR SERVICES TO A THEATER WITH NO RESULTS. THEY ARE UNAWARE THAT THE LETTER THE DISPUTE ARE BEING SPENT ON PAID ACCOUNT. AND IT MULTIPLE LETTERS ARE MAILED AT THEIR COST FOR ACCOUNTS PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHEN CONTRACTING WITH THE CSO WE'RE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN YOUR IPHONE TODAY ON EIGHTY TEN EIGHTY NINE. THIS BILL IS CRITICALLY NEEDED TO UPDATE THE CREDIT SERVICES ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT WILL ULTIMATELY INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES TO CONSUMERS FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE C. IT SAYS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T SEE ANYBODY HERE IN THE ROOM OR THE REMOTE LOCATION WILL WISH TO SPEAK SO LET'S OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES FOR CALLERS IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN EIGHTY NINE.

I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE- AND THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS BOTTLE ANALYSIS. THE AUTHORS GOAL AND THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED BENEFITS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS- SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TEN EIGHTY NINE ON OUR ABILITY TO ASSIST CONSUMERS. AGAINST DEBT COLLECTORS TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. UNLIKE DEBT COLLECTION THIS IS NOT AN AREA OF CONSUMER FINANCE WORK THERE HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMING ISSUES OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS REVIEWS- AS EVIDENCED BY BOTH- RECENT CFPB FINDINGS. AND THE LACK OF ANY CONSUMER GROUPS. SUPPORTING THIS BILL. WHILE MANY OF THE MEN IN THE ANALYSIS HELP TO WOULD SOME CONSUMER CONCERNS OUR POSITION REMAINS SIMPLE. AB TWENTY NINE BENEFITS THAT COLLECTORS AND HARMS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. ADMITTEDLY IT SOUNDS REASONABLE IT'S AFFECTS ARE NOT. ROUTINELY EVERY CONSUMER CRITICISM IS ALREADY COVERED BY EXISTING STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND I'D BE HAPPY TO WALK ANY NUMBER THREE THE LEGISLATION AND SHOW HOW THAT IS THE CASE- ONE FINAL NOTE SIMILAR LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN OTHER STATES. MOST RECENTLY MARYLAND AND EACH OF THOSE LEGISLATURES HAVE DETERMINED THAT SHIFTING THE BALANCE OF POWER IN FAVOR OF DEBT COLLECTORS IS BAD POLICY. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY MUST ASK YOU BOTH KNOW TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WE HAVE- ISRAEL ACT A FELONY ON BEHALF OF LEXINGTON LAW AND PROGRESSION ARE YOU THERE MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE KNOCKING ON THE FROM THE AFTERMARKET HERE ON BEHALF OF CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS PROGRESSION BACK INTO LAW WE ALSO THINK DOCTOR NEXT. AFTER THEIR TIME IN THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS STAFF OR TWO THOUSAND AND THE AMENDMENTS WELL WE OPPOSE EIGHTY TEN EIGHTY NINE WE AGREE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE CONSUMER HAVE CLARITY ABOUT THE SERVICES THEY ARE GETTING AND HOW THEY ARE GETTING THEM. SO WE DO NOT OBJECTTO PROTECTIONS AND OVERSIGHT ON PRINCIPLE HOWEVER WE FIND IT DISCONCERTING TO BE THE SUBJECT OF RESTRICTIONS CRAFTED BY THE DEBT COLLECTOR TO GET TRULY REPRESENT CONSUMERS. AS OPPOSED TO AN OBJECTIVE REGULATED ENTITIES SUCH AS THE FBI OUR OVERARCHING CONCERN HERE RELATE TURRITELLIDAE TO CONTINUE TEXAS CONSUMERS EFFECTIVELY LOOKING FORWARD EVEN WITH THAT MANAGE PROPOSED TODAY AT TEN THE NINE WITH FINALLY A ROAD THAT ABILITY BY SEPARATING BAGHDAD THE OBJECT OF COMBATIVITY GENERALLY REPRESENTS. SENDING COMMUNICATIONS OF THE CONSUMER IS NOT IDEAL BUT IT IS A FUNCTION OF FEDERAL LAW THAT COULD BE CLEAR AS LONG AS FEDERAL LAW REMAINS THE SAME AMENDING CALIFORNIA LOTS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL WOULD ONLY SERVE AS A GIFTED THAT COLLECTOR. AND HER CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS OPT FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU. TO VOTE NOW TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT. ADDITIONAL CALLERS. MISTER WRITER PLEASE HELP UP THE PHONE LINES FOR.

WITH OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE BILL STALLED IN THE SENATE DUE TO COVE IT- AB THREE NINETY WOULD IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY FOR CONSUMERS ABOUT WHEN AND HOW THEIR CHARGE FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR CONSUMERS TO CANCEL THEIR SUBSCRIPTIONS ONLINE WITHOUT HAVING TO JUMP THROUGH TOO MANY HOOPS. AB THREE NINETY WOULD DO TWO THINGS FIRST WOULD REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF A FREE GIFT TRAWLER PROMOTIONAL OR DISCOUNTED PRICE THAT IS LONGER THAN THIRTY ONE DAYS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF A SUBSCRIPTION THAT AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR LESS FREQUENTLY. SECOND TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH TOO MANY HOOPS IN A DOOR LIKE THE CANCELLATION PROCESS THE BILL SPECIFIES A CONSUMERS MUST BE ABLE TO CANCEL THEIR SUBSCRIPTIONS ONLINE AT WILL AND WITHOUT ANY FURTHER STEPS THAT OBSTRUCT OR DELAY THEIR ABILITY TO CANCEL IMMEDIATELY. I'VE GOT A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION I'M GONNA SKIP THEM FOR NOW HAPPY TO DIVE INTO THEM IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS WITH ME TODAY BY PHONE IS MATT BELTRAME- THE HEAD OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S.

THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATT BELTRAME WELL I'M AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY NOW ME COUNTY I SPEAK TODAY. ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTED DISTRICT THREE. NOW A- PART OF AB THREE NINETY AYE SIR FOR TWELVE YEARS THE IS OFFICE IN THE CONSUMER PROTECTION UNIT. AND LINK SEVERAL CASES ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE SAY THE CALIFORNIA. AMONG THE STATUTE ARE PRETTY CLEAR RISE IN OUR CASES CALIFORNIA'S AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION LEGISLATION AUTOMATIC RENEWAL CONTRACT CAN IN MY EXPERIENCE BE TRAPS FOR THE UNWARY WHICH CAN RESULT IN BONTA SOMETIMES YEARS OF I NOTICED CREDIT CARD CHARGES. C. A. R. L. REQUIRES COMPANIES THAT WISH TO ENTERTAIN SUCH CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS TO MAKE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES AND THEN CAME AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. PERSONALLY HANDLE THE NUMBER OF CIVIL IN WHICH COMPANIES WERE LEADS TO HAVE VIOLATED THIS LAW. MY DISTRICT ATTORNEY COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE PARTICULARLY THOSE- IN THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TASK FORCE HAVE BROUGHT OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST LARGE COMPANIES AS WELL. THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL LAW HAS BEEN A REAL ASSET TO CONSUMERS IN OUR STATE IT EXEMPLIFIED CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS A LEADER IN CONSUMER PROTECTION. OVER TIME PROPERLY COUNCIL BUSINESSES HAVE COME. TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLLOWING ALONG. THE A. R. L. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN HOWEVER IS NOT PERFECT. SOME OLDER MAIN FOR EXAMPLE NOTHING CURRENT LAW REQUIRES COMPANIES TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE CHARGED EITHER AT THE END OF A FREE TRIAL PERIOD. OR AT THE TIME OF AN ANNUAL RENEWAL I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS THESE DAYS ARE COMPLETED ONLINE SUCH NOTIFICATIONS WOULD BE INEXPENSIVE AND EASY TO AUTOMATE. ALSO ALTHOUGH THE STATUTE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN REQUIRES A COMPANY THAT OFFERS AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL CONTRACT ONLINE ALSO TO MAKE CANCELLATION ONLINE. WE'VE SEEN THAT MANY COMPANIES MAKE CANCELLATION TRICKY OR TIME CONSUMING REQUIRED CONSUMERS TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS TO STOP. THE CHARGES TO THEIR CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS. DISTRICT ATTORNEY O'MALLEY SAID AB THREE NINETY BE IT'S- THE SIMPLER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. BY HELPING TO PLUG THE HOLES. FIRST IT REQUIRES A BUSINESS NOTIFIED CUSTOMERS BEFORE HIS OR HER CREDIT CARD IS CHARGED EITHER AT THE CONCLUSION OF A FREE TRIAL PERIOD. OR DURING THE ON ANNUAL RENEWAL PERIOD. GIVING CONSUMERS SUCH NOTICE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW WHEN AND HOW MUCH THEY WILL BE CHARGED. IN AVOID THE SURPRISES THAT AUTHORIZED WHEN BUSY CONSUMERS FORGET THEY HAVE ROLLED AND SOMETIMES EXPENSIVE PROGRAMS. SECOND THE BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL AUTOMATICALLY A CONTRACT AT WILL. WITHOUT HAVING TO ENGAGE IN STEPS THAT WILL DISTRACT OR DELAY THEIR ABILITY TO DO SO. YOUR REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE A METHOD OF TERMINATION THAT IS NOT HIDDEN OR HARD TO FIND. AND IT WILL HELP CLOSE THOSE WHO. AT SOME CONSUMER THAT SOME BUSINESSES REQUIRE CONSUMERS TO JUMP THROUGH IN ORDER TO CANCEL. THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LAW. VANCE THE INTERESTS IF YOU WERE PROTECTION WITHOUT PLACING AN UNDUE BURDEN ON INDUSTRY. ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE RESPECTFULLY. I DOUBT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCHSIR- SEEING NOBODY HERE IN THE ROOM OR AT THE REMOTELOCATION A% WISH TO TESTIFY. LET'S. GO TO OUR PHONE LINE.

NOBODY ELSE IS QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET US GO TO OPPOSITION BELIEVE WE HAVE TO pWITNESSES- IT'S IN OPPOSITION FIRST. OF CAMERON- DIMITRI WITH TECHNIP ARE YOU ON THE LINE MISDEMEANOR. YES I AM SURE TO HEAR ME YES WE CAN PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY EGGMAN SHARED MEMBERS CAME TO MEET HIM TO HELP PROTECT THAT. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS OF THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE TECHNET RESPECT PLEASE TAKE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ADDITIONAL AB THREE NINETY. THOUGH WELL INTENTIONED BILL PLACES A SERIES OF COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES THAT WILL UNINTENTIONALLY IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL UNNECESSARY COSTS ON BUSINESS WERE ALREADY DOING THE RIGHT THING. WE HAVE A FEW OPTIONS COMPARE FIRST AB NINETY IN A CONSUMERS WITH THE NOTE. LEADING TO NOTICE FIFTY. I CAN'T LANGUAGE OF AB THREE IS ON REGARDING THE INTO OF ANY CAN'T. CONSUMERS NOT BE ABLE TO VIEWS FREE TRIAL OR SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOW THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PREFERENTIAL RATES. TODAY HAVE A RIGHT TO CANCEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM. IT'S GREAT SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC CONCERNS BOB THIS IS GIVEN THAT THESE TYPES OF SUBSCRIPTION DROPPED IN PRICE BASED ON THE TERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION. FINALLY THE BILL SAYS COMPANIES MAY REQUIRE BUSINESS TO AUTHENTICATE CONSUMER BEFORE CANCELLATION BUT ALSO CREATES A LOOP OFF THE CONSUMERS ARE WILLING. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE SOME COMPANIES OFFER SUBSCRIPTIONS TO IDENTITY PROTECTION SERVICES THE ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE. FOR EXAMPLE LET'S NOT BE SURPRISED IF ALL HARM HE CALLED AGAIN TO BOTH OF THESE SERVICES WILDLIFE KNOWLEDGE. IN TURN HE COULD STEAL HER IDENTITY AND OPEN OR CLOSE REYES ACCOUNT AND HER NAME. BEYOND THAT DIMENSION COULD FOLLOW UP WITH AN EMAIL SERVICE TO SAY HE CAN'T REMEMBER THE PASSWORD THERE'S LESS YOU KNOW IN THAT CASE THE EMAIL SERVICE WOULD ASK THE SUBJECT OF RECENT EMAILS. THAT SENT TO GET THERE I RECEIVED AN EMAIL CANCELING MY SUBSCRIPTION TO THE IDENTITY PROTECTION AND ANTI VIRUS SOFTWARE. IT WOULD BE A VALID AUTHENTICATION. AND IT COULD CHANGE HIS LIFE YOU KNOW PASSWORD. TO BE LOCKED OUT. HE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR EMAIL ACCOUNT. IS ACTUALLY THE LACK OF AUTHENTICATION CAN CREATE CASCADING ACCOUNT LONG ABILITIES WHICH BAD ACTORS CAN USE TO EXPLOIT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. FOR THESE REASONS TAKEN AT RESPECTFUL THE- ADDED TO THIS BILL. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPERA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECOND WITNESSES- MISTER TIMOTHY JOHNSON WITH ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION. ARE YOU ON THE LINE WAS JOHNSON. I AM MISTER SHARE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I GET AFTER CHURCH MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN WRECKED IN SOFTWARE SO. I AM TODAY. TO THOSE THAT NEED THREE ADDS READ. ENTERTAINMENT SO SERVES AS THE VOICE AND ADVOCATE THE AUSTIN UNION. YES A MEMBER COMPANIES ARE PUBLISHERS OF MANNINGS THAT MANY OF THE LARGEST TITLES THEY'RE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED VIDEO GAME COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA A LOT MAKE MY REMARKS TO RESPOND YES YES CONCERNS WITH AB THREE NINETY BUT WE LIKE TO FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR IN OUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PERMIT A USER TO CANCEL HIS OR HER SUBSCRIPTION WITHOUT AUTHENTICATING THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IF THE ACCOUNT HOLDER IN THE VIDEO GAME CONTACT THE SECURE USER ACCOUNT IS THAT TOUCH POINT THROUGH WHICH CONSTRUCTION SUMER INTERACTS OF THE GAME PUBLISHER OR THE GAME SERVICE OPERATOR TO. CUSTOMIZE THEIR ACCOUNT PREFERENCES CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT COMPLETE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS PURCHASING DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT OR SUBSCRIBING TO AN ONLINE GAME AND LASTLY CANCEL SERVICES OR CLOSE THEIR ACCOUNT. BECAUSE MANY MANY OF THESE INTERACTIONS MAY INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF PERSONAL DATA INCLUDING IN SOME CASES THE COLLECTION OF CREDIT CARD INFORMATION BECOMES CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED WITH APPROPRIATE CREDENTIALS. FOR EXAMPLE A USER NAME AND PASSWORD. FROM SECURITY THIS MAY PERFECT YOU KNOW WANT ONE AUTHORIZED. MAKE ON ALL CHARGE ON YOUR WILL YOU IN YOUR DAY AUTHENTICATION ABOUT PROTECTING THE USER SAFE. AGAINST FRAUD WHICH CAN HURT NOT ONLY THE PUBLISHER BUT OTHER USERS AS WELL. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF INDUSTRY PRACTICES YES HE IS NOT AWARE OF ANY WAY IN WHICH OUR MEMBERS CAN ENABLE CANCELLATION OF SERVICES WITHOUT AUTHENTICATING THE USER'S IDENTITY. AS AN AUTHORIZED USER WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR SECURITY PURPOSES. DEPARTMENT CANCELLATION WITHOUT AUTHENTICATION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO SOCIAL ENGINEERING EXPLOITS THAT COULD LEAD TO ACCOUNT FRAUD. YES THEY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH A SPONSOR IN THIS COMMITTEE TO CRAFT A LAW THAT PROTECTS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS FOR FOLKS WHO ARE NOT THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER FOR THE INSURANCE. PEOPLE ON THEIR SPOUSES PLAN OR YOUNG ADULTS ON THEIR PARENTS PLAN. IN THOSE INSTANCES THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT CARE THAT A PATIENT MAY NOT WANT REVEALED. IN SOME CASES IT COULD BE EVEN DANGEROUS FOR THAT PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER TO RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION. THE WOMAN ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE CARE OR CARE RELATED TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT MAY NOT WANT HER PARENTS AND OUR PARTNER TO KNOW. A TRANSGENDER YOUTH MAY NOT WANT THEIR PARENTS TO KNOW THAT THEIR TRANSITIONING OR ACCESSING GENDER AFFIRMING HEALTH CARE. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THE PATIENT TO REQUEST INFORMATION THAT RELATED TO THE SERVICES NOT BE SENT TO A PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER THROUGH A CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS REQUEST. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO STANDARDIZED CCR PROCESS SO FOLLOW THROUGH HAS BEEN BURIED AND HAPHAZARD. IT'S CONFOUNDING PLANTS WITH THE STATE IF INSURANCE COMPANIES FAIL TO ACCOMMODATE THE REQUEST BUT BY THAT TIME THE DAMAGE IS DONE. THIS BILL WOULD IMPROVE UPON EXISTING PROTECTIONS IN TWO MAJOR WAYS FIRST IT WOULD ESTABLISH AUTOMATIC CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR SENSITIVE SERVICES ENSURING THAT PRIVACY IS NOT VIOLATED. AND SECOND IT EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF SENSITIVE SERVICES TO INCLUDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND TRANSGENDER HEALTHCARE TO INSURE MORE PEOPLE CAN HAVE PRIVACY PROTECTED. MY OFFICE HAS BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS ANY REMAINING CONCERNS. AND I APPRECIATE THAT ALL OF US AGREE THAT WE DON'T WANT ANY PATIENT TO AVOID CRITICAL CARE TO PREVENT A POLICY HOLDER FROM FINDING OUT ABOUT THE CARE.

FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S HEALTH CENTERS CONFIDENTIALITY ABOUT THE CORE OF ITS ROLE AS A TRUSTED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. PATIENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS SENSITIVE SERVICES LIKE REPRODUCTIVE CARE GENDER AFFIRMING CARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RAFFI I CARE WITHOUT FEAR OF HAVING A PRIVATE INFORMATION EXPOSED. WHEN PATIENTS SEEK CARE THEY MAY NOT REALIZE THAT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CARE THEY RECEIVE COULD BE THIS CLOSE BY REACHING NOTED THAT FROM THE HEALTH INSURER. IT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MINOR THAN YOUNG ADULTS ARE ON THEIR PARENTS PLANS. ANYONE WHO HAS HAD TO NAVIGATE COVERAGE ISSUES WITH THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE NOW BUT IT IS NOT A SIMPLE OR EASY PROCESS. AND THE CENTRE LINE OTHER PEOPLE FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE NOT HAVE TO PLAN IN ADVANCE AND THEN WITH THE HELP OF CONSUMER RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND ATTORNEYS. TO ENSURE. THAT THEY CAN GET THE MEDICAL CARE THEY NEED. HEALTH CARE. AND CONFIDENTIAL IS CRITICAL. TO ENSURING THAT ALL PACE CAN CONTINUE TO ASK. NEEDED SERVICES. YOUR JUDGMENT ABOUT HOW DECISIONS.

PROBABLY MEANT AND A WELCOME TO OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF YOUR VERY GOODWORK ON THIS BILL WILL WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING THE MMS LISTEN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON PAGES FOUR AND FIVE. THIS IS A BILL THAT'S NOT A SPONSORED BILL THIS IS A BILL THAT CAME OUT OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE'VE HAD IN OUR OFFICES- THAT REALLY INCREASE DURING COVERT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAD BOUGHT TICKETS TO PERFORMANCES SOMETIMES VERY EXPENSIVE PERFORMANCES AND HAD THOSE POOR PERFORMANCES EITHER CANCELED OR SUBSTITUTED OUT- AND- WHEN PEOPLE WOULD TRY TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK OFF AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THERE BUT THERE ARE GET A REFUND FOR THOSE TICKETS- THEY WERE INSTEAD OFFERED SUB TWO PERFORMANCES AT A TIME WHEN THEY REALLY JUST WANTED THE MONEY BACK. SO THEY BUY TICKET TO AEROSMITH AND SAID THAT THEY WERE SUBSTITUTING KENNY G. YOU'RE OUT A LOT- AND THAT WAS SORT OF YOU KNOW ALLOWABLE- AND THERE'S BEEN REALLY BECAUSE OF COVERT THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF UNANTICIPATED CANCELLATIONS OF TICKETS BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE ON THE CONSUMERS TO HAVE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THAT COST THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK- NOW DURING KOBE BECAUSE OF THE STRAIN THAT THAT WAS PUTTING ON SOME OF OUR LIVE. VENUES UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THEM WENT BACK AND RETROACTIVELY CHANGE THEIR CONTRACTS OF WITHOUT A YOU KNOW A LEARNING CONSUMERS ARE GIVING THEM ANY VOICE SO THEY WOULD WERE THEY RE IT RETROACTIVELY CHANGE THEIR CONTRACTS TO REMOVE THE REFUND GUARANTEE IN FAVOR OF A SUBSTITUTE PERFORMANCES INSTEAD. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT ENSURES THAT TICKET BUYERS HAVE TO RECEIVE THEIR REFUNDS WITHOUT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE EVENT CANCELLATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO AND BEG FOR THEIR MONEY BACK THAT MONEY JUST HAS TO BE GIVEN TO THEM. AND IT ALSO- US SAYS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE OF GETTING A REFUND IF THE- SHOW TO WHICH THEY BOUGHT THE TICKET IS SUBSTITUTED WITH A DIFFERENT ARTIST OR DIFFERENT CHAU ALTOGETHER- OFTEN ALSO- SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY BUY A TICKET THAT. THE OF THE TICKETS COMING FOR FROM AN- ON A- THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE THEATER. AND THE LIMITS THE ABILITY OF THE TICKET BUYER TO RESELL THE TICKET OR TO GIVE IT AWAY. TO SOMEBODY ELSE IF THEY CAN'T USE IT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WILL SAY WELL I CAN'T USE THIS TICKET I'M GONNA SELL IT OR I'M GONNA GIVE IT TO A FRIEND. BUT THEIR CONTRACT SAYS THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE THE PERSON THEY HAVE TO SHOW I TO SAY THAT IT'S THEM. THIS CLEAR FOR THIS A BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT THAT'S MAKE CLEAR TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY BUY IT. SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY PURCHASE IT THAT THAT'S THE CONTRACT THAT THEY'RE ENTERING INTO. A WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ANYBODY WHO IS- ANY STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE BILL WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN AMENDMENTS.

POTENTIAL TO BETTER OUR LIVES. OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION SMART SPEAKERS TODAY HAVE BEEN SOLD GLOBALLY. IT'S A MASSIVE MARKET. HOWEVER SOME PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE THAT THESE DEVICES ARE CAPABLE OF VOICE RECORDING AND CLOUD STORAGE SOMETIMES WITHOUT A WAKE WORD BEING USED OR INTENTIONAL ACTIVATION BY. THE USER. SIMPLY PUT AB TWELVE SIXTY TWO WOULD PROHIBIT A SMART SPEAKER DEVICE FROM USING RECORDINGS OR TRANSCRIPTIONS THE QUALIFY AS PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER THE CCPA. FROM BEING USED FOR AN ADVERTISING PURPOSE SHARED WITH A THIRD PARTY OR RETAINED ELECTRONICALLY UNLESS THE CONSUMER HAS OPTED IN WITH AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT IF THE CONSUMER HAS OPTED IN WITH AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. THAN THOSE PROVISIONS WOULD NOT APPLY TO THAT DEVICE THERE'S TWO BORTON THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT HOW THIS BILL DIFFERS FROM LAST SESSION'S VERSION WHICH DIED FROM COVERT OR ENCODED RELATED REASONS IN THE SENATE- THIS BILL EXEMPTS ENTIRELY DE IDENTIFIED DATA. OR DATA THAT CANNOT BE LINKED TO A PARTICULAR CONSUMER. SECONDLY IT. APPLIES ONLY TO RECORDINGS FROM SMART SPEAKERS AND WE'VE TIGHTENED UP THE DEFINITION OF A SMART SPEAKER DEVICE AND CREATED A BUNCH OF EXEMPTION SO YOUR CELL PHONE. IT WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. PRIVACY MY VIEW IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE NOR IS IT AN ISSUE WE CAN IGNORE AS POLICY MAKERS WELL THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE IMPROVED OUR LIVES AND WILL CONTINUE. TO AND WE ARE VERY GLAD FOR THAT. WE MUST CREATE BASIC SAFEGUARDS FOR CONSUMERS. AND WE MUST ASSURE PEOPLE THAT THE PRIVACY IN THEIR HOME WHERE THE PRIVACY INTEREST IS AT ITS ABSOLUTE PEAK. IS PROTECTED FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I'D LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER TO. ARIEL FOX JOHNSON FROM COMMONSENSE- TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU CARACALLA NUMBERS WITH THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE I'M OUR OUTBOX JOHNSON YOUR COUNSEL AT COMMON SENSE MEDIA REPLACES THE PART AB TWELVE SIXTY TWO WHICH WOULD GIVE FAMILIES MUCH NEEDED PROTECTIONS OVER SMART SPEAKERS WHICH SKY ROCKETED POPULARITY LAST YEAR. BURKE SPEAKERS ARE INCREASINGLY PLACE AND FAMILY ROOMS KITCHENS AND EVEN KIDS BEDROOMS. A PRICE POINT OF UNDER SIXTY DOLLARS AND PANDA DESIGNS CAN ENCOURAGE THIS. AND SPEAKERS PERMANENT PERCH AND SENSITIVE LOCATIONS AND THEIR ABILITY TO LISTEN TO ANY SPOKEN WORD MERIT SPECIAL PROTECTIONS. FOR CONSUMERS FROM THE GET GO. MANY OF THE DEVICES KEEP. AND RECORD AND- INDEED SOME EVEN KEEP INFORMATION CONSUMERS THINK THEY HAD DELETED BY MAINTAINING A TRANSCRIPT OR DELETING AUDIO. EMPLOYEES CAN LISTEN TO RECORDINGS AND RECORDINGS AND TRANSCRIPTS CAN BE USED COMMERCIALLY PROFILE AND TARGET FAMILY. FAMILIES LOVE THE CONVENIENCE OF THESE DEVICES ESPECIALLY THIS PAST YEAR BUT THEY WANT MORE CONTROL ACCORDING TO A COMPETENT CERVANTES PARTS BICKERED MORE THAN NINE IN TEN PARENTS THINK IT'S IMPORTANT MAKING CONTROL THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT THEIR FAMILY. YEP FAMILY FEEL HELPLESS A THIRD SAID THAT WHILE THEY'D LIKE TO LIMON INFORMATION COLLECTION BY SUCH DEVICES THEY DON'T KNOW HOW. THIS BILL WOULD GIVE FAMILIES THE CONTROL THEY WANT IT WOULD PROHIBIT COMPANIES FROM USING INDIVIDUALS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE START SPEAKER RECORDINGS. IN TRANSCRIPTIONS FOR ADVERTISING IT WOULD REQUIRE OPT IN CONSENT FOR CONSUMERS. IF A COMPANY IS THOUGHT OR SHARE THIS INFORMATION FOR A NEW MOM I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION FANS THREE ABOUT HER BABY'S DEVELOPMENT. IT DOESN'T WANT THAT SENSITIVE. REQUIRE PAPERS THIS BILL PROVIDES. FOR FAMILIES WHO WANT TO KEEP A CHILD LEARN JUST. PRIVATE BUT STILL WANT THEIR KIDS TURNED A DEVICE FOR SCHOOL HELP. THIS BILL PROVIDES PROTECTION. WE THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO PRESS FOR A STRONG AND PRIVACY PROTECTIVE BELL AN IDEA WHAT THE COVER ALL SMART SPEAKER DEVICES.

BUT UNDER THIS BILL IF THE CUSTOMER USES THEIR VOICE TO ORDER GROCERIES VIA THEIR SMART SPEAKER THEY CANNOT. THERE IS NO PRIVACY BENEFIT FOR THIS DISCRIMINATION AND IN FACT DISADVANTAGES SOME COMMUNITIES. CERTAIN THE AUTHOR BRINGS UP THE CONCERN THAT SMART SPEAKERS MIGHT BE LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY SHOULD BE WE CALL THAT A FALSE WAY. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN IN FACT IT COULD MAKE IT WORSE LEARNING FROM FALSE WEIGHT DATA HELPS TO PREVENT THEM FROM HAPPENING THE LAST NAMES ARE NOT INTENDED. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES CUSTOMERS TO OPT INTO THE DEVICES FUNCTION PROPERLY. DOES SO WITH PRESCRIPTIVE AFFIRMATIVE WRITTEN CONSENT THAT MAY REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO STATE THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE FOR THAT BUSINESS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES CUSTOMERS TO OPT IN FOR THE DEVICE TO SHARE THEIR VOICE COMMAND WITH THAT THIRD PARTY APPS FOR EXAMPLE IF I ASK MY SPORTS SPEAKER. TO PLAY A VIDEO OR SONG MY FAVORITE STREAMING DEVICE DATA SHARING DATA WITH A THIRD PARTY ACCESSING THE FUNCTIONALITY. OF AN APP OR WEBSITE YOUR VOICE IS THE PURPOSE OF THE SMART SPEAKER. AND ALSO THIS BILL REQUIRES CUSTOMERS TO OPT INTO THE DEVICE RETAINING DATA IF SOMEONE DOES NOT OFTEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CALL THEIR CONTACTS PLAY MUSIC GLASS SHOP PERHAPS SET UP TO TURN ON THEIR LIGHTS. OKAY ALL OF THIS WILL CREATE CUSTOMER CONFUSION FRUSTRATION WITHOUT ADDRESSING FALSE WICKS AND IT WILL HAMPER INNOVATION IN THESE LIFE CHANGING PRODUCTS FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE.

SMART SPEAKERS FOR ME GREATER LEVELS OF INDEPENDENCE AND PRIVACY. IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF THIS BILL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU BALANCE THEM AGAINST THE PROPER ACTION. THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES PEOPLE. TO OPT IN IN ORDER FOR THE DEVICE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. IT'S CONFUSING. PEOPLE ONE UNDERSTAND THAT IF I DON'T HAVE BEEN. I WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTROL. LIFE. MY DOORS. THE NEW. NONE OF THESE FUNCTIONS WILL BE A- YOU LOOK AT THE BILLS FAN A- MOTION AND AVERAGE AND IT IS BASICALLY THE TRUMP THE COMMAND IN BY MY VOICE TO MATCH BECAUSE WILL COME BEACH FROM.

MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD WITH THAT- LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMEDIAN IS OR WHEN GO AHEAD- THANK YOU. VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO- I THINK THERE IS NOTHING MORE CREEPY THAN WHEN- I HAVE. A ADVERTISEMENT ON MY PHONE ABOUT THE CONVERSATION I'M- HAVING I HOPE THAT WAS ONLY A- COINCIDENCE BUT- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE- WORKING ON BUT I THINK THIS BILL. NEEDS SOME FUNDAMENTAL WORK- LAST TIME I BROUGHT IT UP LIGHT IT UP STATE. AND- SUBNATIONAL COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED ALREADY BY THE OPPOSITION- THIS BILL. ADOPTS A OFTEN RATHER THAN AN OPT OUT AND THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT FROM WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND VOTERS HAVE DONE WITH CCPA AND CPRE. AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT YOUR BILL WILL HAVE- THAT THE IMPACT YOUR BILL WILL HAVE ON THE OPERATION OF SMART SPEAKERS. WILL HAVE MORE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS. PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED SMART SPEAKERS- ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING TO USE VOICE RECOGNITION AND PUTTING BARRIERS BETWEEN THEM AND- THE PURCHASE FEATURES SEEMS INTRUSIVE TO ME AND YOU HEARD THAT FROM THE LAST SPEAKER AND I CERTAINLY KNOW ALSO WITH MY PARENTS WHO ARE IN THEIR EIGHTIES THAT. THEY LOVE THE EASE THAT THEY HAVE- WITH THEIR- ALEXA. AND THEN I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THEIR SPECIFIC. LANGUAGE THAT- REALLY NEEDS TO BE CARE IN THE FALL AND THAT'S THE- BETWEEN BASIC FUNCTIONS AND ENHANCE US MARKETERS SO. SAME THING THAT I SAID THE LAST TIME AND I'M CERTAINLY HOPING THAT I CAN SUPPORT YOUR BILL ON THE FLOOR. AND I WILL EXPLAIN. PRINT OUT THIS WEEK'S GO AHEAD PLEASE- AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS BILL UP- UP AGAIN AND I HAVE A QUESTION AND A COMMENT- THE SECOND SPEAKER. WOULD HE BE ABLE TO USE ALL THESE FUNCTIONALITIES SIMPLY BY OPTING IN. YES UNDER UNDER THIS BILL LANGUAGE IF THE- THE INFORMED CONSENTS GIVEN AT THE TIME OF SET UP OF THE DEVICE AND IF THE- USER CHOOSES TO OPT INTO THE ENHANCED FEATURES AS THE FINE THEN THERE WOULD BE NO LIMITATIONS WHATSOEVER- ON. ANYTHING RIGHT RIGHT SO I THINK THAT SOLVES. MAYBE NOT A 100% OF THAT ISSUE BUT IT CERTAINLY SOLVES A- LARGE PERCENTAGE OF IT IN MOST USE CASES OKAY AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IT. AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES WHICH DOES VERY RAPIDLY- IT IS OUR DUTY TO TRY TO CATCH UP TO THAT FROM A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. FOR IT FROM MY OPINION WITH AN EYE TOWARDS PRIVACY- SO I KNOW IT'S A COMPLICATED SUBJECT MATTER YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED ON THIS AND FOR A YEAR OR TWO IN THIS SPACE- I WANT TO KEEP SEE THIS BILL KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND I KNOW THERE ARE STILL THINGS TO WORK OUT. WHICH I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM WILL BE ABLE TO DO AND LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. MISTER BENNETT. CHECK HI YOU HAVE. I APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WITH THE BILL WANT TO. SURE THAT THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT YOU. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON ADDRESS OF THESE ISSUES. ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE OFTEN HE SAID ITSELF'S. NOT A 100% BUT CERTAINLY VAST MAJORITY THE PROBLEMS I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT. SMALL RESERVE- MY RIGHT TO. WHEN WE GET WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR BUT I DO A LOT OF MOVE OUT HERE SO YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON. THANK YOU. HE THERE ARE NO ADDITION. COMMENTS WANT TO THANK. MISTER CUNNINGHAM FOR. YOUR CO CONTINUE WORK IN FACT I THINK YOU STARTED MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO AND I TRULY. APPLAUD YOUR WORK. AND THIS IS THE- ISSUE THAT YOU CAN TRY TO. OF TACKLE FOR AWHILE SO I. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL OUT ABSOLUTELY- I THINK- YOU KNOW THE BILL PROBABLY NEEDS A LITTLE FINE TUNING HEARING THERE SO. SO I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING. HI THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE- TO ME ALSO SO. SO WITH THAT THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES IF I MAY I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK I DID WANT TO DRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY TECHNO AND- SOME OF THE VERY THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS BY. BY THE COMMITTEE- YES IT'S TRUE THE STREETS A TYPE OF DEVICE DIFFERENTLY BUT THAT THAT DEVICE ITSELF IS DIFFERENT. RIGHT THIS BUILDS ON AN EXISTING CODE SECTION THAT SAYS. TELEVISIONS ARE CONNECTED TELEVISIONS CANNOT RECORD PEOPLE- THEN THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE SMART SPEAKERS ARE STABLE IN THE USED IN THE HOME THE HOUSTON BEDROOMS IN THE USED IN KITCHENS JUST LIKE A TV IS MOUNTED. OR PROPPED UP OR SITTING. IN YOUR LIVING ROOM OR IN YOUR KITCHEN SO. I ME BECAUSE- BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE DEVICE- I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE- PRIVACY. PROTECTIONS THAT THE USER NEEDS. ARE COMMENSURATELY GREATER- IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A KEYBOARD AND TYPING IN THE KEY THE- TECH THAT INDIVIDUALS TALKING ABOUT KEYSTROKES AND SO FORTH. BUT KEYBOARDS CAN'T RECORD YOUR VOICE RECORDINGS AND SEND THEM TO THE CLOUD TO BE STORED. WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN AND DISTRIBUTED. TO GOD KNOWS WHERE ALL OVER THE EARTH AND THE KEYBOARDS DON'T HAVE THOSE FEATURES. SO IT IS DIFFERENT BILL. THAT'S NECESSARILY SO. AGAIN IF THE- DATA IS DE IDENTIFIED THEN THERE'S NO. LIMITATION WHATSOEVER ON THE USE OF THAT. ARE A LOT OF SMART SPEAKER MANUFACTURERS ALTHOUGH NOT ALL BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE DOING THAT ALREADY. SO I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE'VE GOT THAT- FINE TUNE A LITTLE BIT BETTER- IT DOES NEED SOME WORK AND I WANT TO GET TO A 100% ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT SMART. SPEAKERS SPEAKERS I'VE WATCHED SOME VIDEOS AND PRESENTATIONS. AND MY PARENTS ARE GETTING THE AGE WHERE. THEY'RE GONNA NEED THAT TYPE OF. HELP AROUND THE HOUSE AS WELL AND THAT'S- THAT'S REALLY NEAT AND WE NEED TO PRESERVE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING THAT. INHIBITS THE FULL USE OF THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT- MAYBE HAVE LIMITATIONS- NO MATTER THE SOURCE. SO THEY CAN ENJOY THE FULL. BENEFIT OF IT- I THINK WE CAN GET THERE AT AND I THINK I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING ON IT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH INDUSTRY GROUPS. AND ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS ON- YOU KNOW MODIFICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS TO THE LANGUAGE. YEAH MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING TO DO THAT.

I WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO INCREASE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AB NINE EIGHTY FOUR IMPLEMENTS FINDINGS FOR THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION ALTERNATIVE PILOT PROGRAM BY AUTHORIZING THE DMV IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CHP TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS AND MOVE FORWARD. WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION CARDS DIGITAL LICENSE PLATES AND LICENSE PLATE WRAPS. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SB EIGHT OH SIX AUTHORIZED THE DMV TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM FOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION ALTERNATIVES AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. THE PILOT PROGRAM ALLOWED SPECIALTY PLATE OWNERS TO RENEW THE REGISTRATION ELECTRONICALLY. THROUGH DIGITAL LICENSE PLATES PROVIDERS AND ALLOWED INDIVIDUALS TO ACCESS THE REGISTRATION INFORMATION FROM THE LICENSE PLATES APP ESTABLISHED BY THE LICENSE PLATES PROVIDER. THIS PILOT PROGRAM FOUND THAT THESE ALTERNATIVE REGISTRATION IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AT THE DMV BY ALLOWING SPECIALTY PLATE OWNERS TO RENEW THE REGISTRATION VIA AT- A MOBILE APP RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO INTO THE DMV. IN ADDITION THIS PROGRAM COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE THE DMV THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN POSTAGE FOR RENEWAL FEES BY ALLOWING USERS TO RENEW THEIR VEHICLE DIGITALLY- TODAY- TO PROVIDE- SUPPORT TESTIMONY I HAVE GYM LIGHTS REPRESENTING REVIVER. WITHOUT TONE MR LIGHT ARE YOU ON THE LINE PLEASE.

BOB THE OPPOSITION TODAY BECAUSE AB NINETY FOUR THREATENS TO PUT NEW SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY INTO LICENSE PLATES WITHOUT ADEQUATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. BOTH FOR INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS AND FOR EMPLOYEES WHO COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL MONITORING AND TRACKING OF THEIR WORKPLACE AS A RESULT OF THE SPICES. WE DO APPRECIATE THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD. SPONSORS BUT THE BILL STILL LACKS ADEQUATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. LOCATION INFORMATION OF THE TIME GATHERED BY GPS FROM DIGITAL LICENSE PLATES CAN BE CAREFULLY REVEALING A UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZED IN CARPENTER PERSONS UNITED STATES LOCATION INFORMATION QUOTE PROVIDES AN INTIMATE WINDOW INTO A PERSON'S LIFE REVEALING NOT ONLY HERE HIS OR HER PARTICULAR PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS. BUT THROUGH THEM- HER POLITICAL POLITICAL FAMILIAL PROFESSIONAL RELIGIOUS AND SEXUAL ASSOCIATIONS. PERSON ASSOCIATIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE POLITICAL. HOME WORK ADDRESSES HEALTH CONDITIONS CAN ALL BE INFERRED FROM GPS LOCATION INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ELECTRONIC DEVICES. AND CONTACTED DIGITAL LICENSE PLATES ARE OFTEN USED AS PART OF PRIVATE SLEEPS IN A WORKPLACE. INCREASE PROJECT PROTECTIONS NOT REDUCE THEM PEOPLE WHO DRIVE FOR THEIR WORK MAY FIND THEMSELVES FACING THE CHOICE OF ACCEPTING BEING TRACKED BY THE LICENSE PLATE ON THE CAR THEY DRIVE. OR LOSING THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND THAT'S NOT A CHOICE TO ANYONE SHOULD BE FACED WITH TODAY. I NOTICED THAT THE DRIVER IN THIS CONTEXT REALLY ISN'T ADEQUATE IT'S NECESSARY TO EITHER HAVE STRICT LIMITS ON COLLECTION OR REALLY ROBUST GUARANTEES THAT THE DRIVER HAS REAL POWER TO DECIDE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. BY THE RETURN ON LOCATION TRACKING AND MONITORING- ON THE CAR THEY'RE DRIVING OR NOT. BASICALLY NO GOOD REASON FOR A SIMPLE BY TRYING TO COLLECT HIS PLATE TO INCLUDE. DETAILED SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY TO TRACK AND RECORD PEOPLE'S GPS LOCATIONS USE THAT INFORMATION CAN. EXPOSE PEOPLE TO INTRUSION INTO HARM. ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS- ARE YOU KNOW ABOUT.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR THE THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK AND ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY ALARMED ABOUT THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES IN MODERATING OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE. FOR MANY PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE HORRIFIC ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY AT THE US CAPITOL EARLIER THIS YEAR. THESE CONCERNS CENTER AROUND THE ROLE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PLAY. IN PROMOTING HATE SPEECH. DISINFORMATION CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM. FOR OTHERS IT IS THE MYSTERY BEHIND WHY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS IN CONTENT AND NOT OTHERS ARE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THERE'S GROWING CONCERN ABOUT SEVERE POLITICAL POLARIZATION. AND THE ABILITY OF A HANDFUL OF COMPANIES TO PROFOUNDLY SHAPE THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE THAT IS CENTRAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. AB FIVE EIGHT SEVEN ADDRESSES THESE CONCERNS BY REQUIRING SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO SHARE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CONTENT MODERATION PRACTICES WITH CONSUMERS. PARTICULAR THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE THEIR CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES. HOW DOES POLICIES ARE ENFORCED AND THE KEY METRICS AND DATA AROUND ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE POLICIES. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THESE COMPANIES TO HAVE ANY SPECIFIC POLICIES. NOR DOES IT REQUIRE THEM TO UNDERTAKE ANY TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THEM TO BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WITH POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT. IF ANYTHING THEY ARE DOING TO MODERATE SPEECH ON THEIR PLATFORMS. THIS NARAL APPROACH RESPECTS THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND FEDERAL PREEMPTION WHAT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING MEANINGFUL TRANSPARENCY AND MUCH NEEDED PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. IN SHORT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO COME CLEAN ABOUT HOW THEY'RE MODERATING CONTENT. SO THAT WE ALL CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE AMPLIFYING CERTAIN VOICES AND SILENCING OTHERS. THE PUBLIC AND POLICY MAKERS DESERVE NO LESS. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE APPRECIATE SEVERAL THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. THE AMENDMENTS WE ARE TAKING TODAY ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL. NEEDLESS TO TIME WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO MY WITNESS LARA CRAP FROM THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE. THE REPORT ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND THOUGHTFUL SYSTEMS. THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.

I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS BILL AND I'M ALSO PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE OF YOU SEE THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO REGULATE THEMSELVES AS THEY ARE NOW BECOMING PUBLIC FORUMS IN THE INTERNET SPACE- I THINK IT SHOULD BE A TIME THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO THE ALWAYS THE MOST EFFECTIVELY SO THEY NEED TO BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK THIS BILLS. AS A AS A STRONG BALANCE BETWEEN THAT MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE SO GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUT ALSO HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT PUBLIC INTEREST OF MAKING SURE THEY'RE NOT JUST- CESSPOOLS OF CONSPIRACIES SO IT'S IMPORTANT AND OBVIOUS FOR THIS BILL TODAY OF COURSE. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT TO PLEASE GO AHEAD. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENTION AND EFFORTS OF THIS BILL AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY IMPORTANT THINGS TO COME OUT OF THIS I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED A- THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO IMPROVE IN THIS BILL AND THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE- PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFERING SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE THE BILL SO.

WANT TO YOU FOR. TACKLING THIS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF BILLS- SIMILAR BILLS GOING THROUGH THE SYSTEM. I'M BACK FOR THE- PAST TWO TWO YEARS AGO AND I HAVE A BILL GOING GOING THROUGH. JUDICIARY AND MR. GALLAGHER IN MISTER KILEY ALSO HAD- HAS ONE. I THINK DEALING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN GENERAL IT'S- SO CUT THAT TELLS ME THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK- THESE PLATFORMS ARE REALLY- IMPACTING OUR- DAILY LIVES AND YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE SO MANY. OF MEMBERS TO TRY TO REALLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU I MEAN I THINK THE WAY THAT YOU YOU APPROACHING THE ISSUE IS A VERY CREATIVE ONE. AND I TRULY APPRECIATE IT- AND- YOU KNOW I THE BILL THAT I'M CARRYING SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS. WHICH- DEALS WITH MISINFORMATION. WHICH IS A KIND OF A PIECEMEAL APPROACH AND- COMPARED TO THE WITH THE WAY YOU HAVE IT- WITH THE CONTENT MONTH MODERATION. WHICH IS A LOT MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAITED TO ADDRESSING IT. AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY AVOIDING THE FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGES AND ALL. SO YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT MY BUILDING MISSED COLLEGE BECAUSE BILL. WENT TO JUDICIARY WAS BECAUSE OF THE- FIRST AMENDMENT COMPONENT. AND ALSO THE SECTION TWO THIRTY OF THAT YOU KNOW THE- COMMISSION DECENCY ACT. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE HURDLES THAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF GO THROUGH. SO THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO THE APPROACH THAT YOU'RE TAKING WITH THIS. SO AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW IT IT. YOU KNOW I YOU LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR ALSO MAYBE. GOING FORWARD. BUT THAT WOULD THAT- I WANT ASK YOU TO CLOSE. YEAH THANK YOU YOUR- THANK YOU MISTER TEPPER PRE. OR NOT YOU'RE A YOUR YOUR YOU'RE TALKING. AND WE BE DELAYED AND pHONORED ADD YOU AS A- AS A- AS A CALL AUTHOR- JUST FOR A MINUTE JUST TO RE. A LITTLE OF WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITE. WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM I DO. TO SOME- SKEPTICISM. THE BURDEN ARGUMENT HERE. YOU KNOW THESE THESE THESE COMPANIES ARE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS DATA CONSTANTLY IT IS PART OF HOW THEY OPTIMIZE THEIR SERVICES. AND JUST TO ADD AN ELEMENT OF REALITY I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FACEBOOK. THEY HAD ANNUAL REVENUE LAST YEAR EIGHTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. I HAVE OVER FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THEY HAVE THE BEST TECHNOLOGISTS AND DATA SCIENTISTS AND- PROGRAMMERS IN THE WORLD AND SO I THINK I'M VERY CONFIDENT IN THEIR ABILITY TO. BEAR THE BURDEN THE VERY MODEST BURDEN THAT THIS BILL IDEA. WHEN IT WOULD IMPOSE ON THEM. AND TO YOUR POINT BEFORE WE ARE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE HERE OF RESPECTING THE FIRST AMENDMENT I THINK THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE TO DO THAT. TO NAVIGATE AND- THREAD THE NEEDLE ON THE FINAL PENSION ISSUES. BUT WE THINK THIS IS THIS BASIC NOTION OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY DOES THAT. MAN WITH I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I BOTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE. HAS THE BILL BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED IT HAS BEEN SO WITHOUT DOUBT- MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS AB FIVE EIGHT SEVEN THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE JUDICIARY WITH AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN IN JUDICIARY. CHAP I. CHAO I KILEY. PARQUET ARE QUE HAND I'VE DONE IT. HI BEN AYE.

AB TWO EIGHTY SIX ONE NOW JUST PROVIDE PRICE TRANSPARENCY THAT WILL ENSURE BOTH RESTAURANT OWNERS AND CUSTOMERS HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING THE. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT WORKERS RECEIVE- THEIR FULL AMOUNT OF TIPS ADD THAT A CUSTOMER GRANTS THEM- COMMISSIONS ARE STILL GOING TO BE A PROBLEM AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE A HUGE PROBLEM AFTER THE PANDEMIC AND THAT. ONCE A LOT OF OUR LOCAL ORDINANCES START TO EXPIRE BUT FOR TODAY THIS BILL JUST PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY SO WE CAN HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT THOSE COMMISSIONS WHATEVER THAT SHOULD BE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS- SHOULD BE A RESTAURANTS ABILITY TO FIND OUT WHO ELSE IS PAYING FEES AND IT SHOULD BE CUSTOMERS OF RESPONSIBLY FIND OUT TO HOW MUCH THE RESTAURANT IS PAIN IT HELPS MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK. FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT DELIVERY IS NOT FREE SOMEBODY IS BEARING THE COST OF THE DELIVERED US AS CUSTOMERS OFTEN AS FREE DELIVERY AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL RESTAURANTS TO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW MUCH THEY'RE PAID. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE FIRST WITNESSES CHASSIS GROW ALONG WITH THE- ARE YOU ON THE YARD OF FOOD WORKER AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS SORRY WHAT THE WESTERN STATE COUNCIL.

IF YOU HAVE THE REPRESENTS OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND RETAIL SECTORS A CALIFORNIA I AM TESTIFYING HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FACT. BUT IF YOU WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ALL HER WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND HER CONTINUED PERSEVERANCE TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS AND WORKERS HAVE THE STRONGEST PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BY UTILIZING THE GIG ECONOMY APPLICATION. TRANSPARENCY ON FEES CHARGED BY THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY FOR CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS ARE ESSENTIAL. DELIVERY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN EMPLOYING DESIGN PRACTICES SET UP I'LL KEEP REPLACE ME THAT ULTIMATELY IMPACT THE FACILITIES PROCESS AND WORKER PAY. TRANSPARENCY IS HELPFUL TO EMPOWER USERS TO MAKE THEIR DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THEIR MONEY IS GOING TOWARD AND HOW IT'S IMPACTING THEIR LOCAL ECONOMY AND THE CONTACT THE LIBERTY PEOPLE WHO LACK FULL TIME WORKER PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS. IT IS ONE OF MANY MECHANISM AN ECOSYSTEM OF CHANGE WE NEED TO FURTHER HOLD COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MANY STAKEHOLDER TO RELY ON THE SERVICE THAT. I DO MINIMUM CONSUMERS THERE'S THERE CAN NOW WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR. A SERVICE SEE A TAB OR EMAIL AND WHO THEY ARE PAYING FOR IT SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW TO UTILIZE THE SERVICE AT. WHAT ADVOCATING OF HOW THESE SERVICES CAN AFFECT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY. CAN BE AMENDED THEIR MARCH AND PARENT INTO HOW THESE BUSINESSES OPERATE TO HOLD THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE THAT. SO WHAT THE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR PRACTICES AND TO HOLD REPRESENTATIVES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR POLICIES. CHICAGO AND WASHINGTON DC HAVE IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR MEASURES TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY FOR CONSUMERS OF PRICING FOR THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE AT. CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD BE THE WAY THAT IF I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE THAT TODAY ON EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SEEN NO ONE IN THE ROOM.

SUPPORT RESTAURATEURS SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE ENTIRE LATINO RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IN LA. AND THROUGHOUT. THE U. S. ON BEHALF OF OUR EIGHT HUNDRED MEMBERS. I'M OPPOSED TO AB TWO EIGHTY SIX. THE LATINO REFLECTION IN THE HAS BEEN HELPING COUNTLESS FAMILY RESTAURANT CLOSED THEIR DOORS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS TURNED. TO DELIVERY PLATFORMS IF THEY OPEN. FOR BACK BRADY REASONS WHY WE APPRECIATE THAT THE OTHER HAD INDICATED THAT SHE HAD PLANNED DOWN TO AMENDMENTS. ON AB TWO EIGHTY SIX ANALYSIS AT THIS SOMETHING. IT UP I'M SORRY THE ANNOUNCES INCLUDED SO I WANTED TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THAT ISSUE. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO ENACT A PRICE CONTROL WE'LL LIKELY SEE HIGHER CUSTOMER FEES LONGER WAIT TIMES LOWER SERVICE AND REDUCE DELIVERY DOWN COVERAGE AT A TIME WHEN TRUCKERS STRUGGLING ESPECIALLY ARE LOOKING A RESTAURANT. IT COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STAYING OPEN AND STAY CLOSE AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THE DEFAMATION OF NOT ONLY. WATCH WHAT THE NATIONAL BLACK LATINO RESTAURANTS BECAUSE OF INCREDIBLY ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO US- AND THIS DOES NOT HELP WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS IN THE BILL WHICH WOULD REQUIRE DELIVERY COMPANIES PUBLICLY DISCLOSED TO CUSTOMERS THE FEES PAID BY RESTAURANT. IN A RESTAURANT DAY PURCHASED DIFFERENT THINGS WITH RESTAURANTS USED TO WORK WITH DELIVERY COMPANIES SOME UP TO PAY FOR SERVICES LIKE ADVERTISING MARKETING WHILE THE OTHERS DO NOT SO. DISCLOSURE OF THESE FEES IS A NECESSARY CREATES COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES SIMPLY PUT AB TWENTY SIX IS NOT THE ANSWER WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ARE SECOND WITNESSES IKE BRANNON WITH. THE JACK KEMP FOUNDATION. MISTER BRANDON I YOU ON THE LINE. THANK I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAMP PLEASE GO AHEAD. THERE ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHORS REMOVED THE COMMISSION CAP PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. BUT ADVOCATE IN ALFA STILL DISCUSSES THE COMMISSION CAP OF LIKE TO SHARE MY OPPOSITION TO THAT AS WELL THE TRANSPARENCY DIVISION BEING DISCUSSED. THE LEGISLATION HAD JUSTIFIED THE CAPITAL A TO HELP STRUGGLING RESTAURANT THE- ENDEMIC. SEVERAL STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT CAPPING THE DELIVERY COMPANY FEES WILL BOOST PROFITS. HOWEVER SUCH OVERARCHING REGULATIONS ARE USUALLY DEFEATED. PRINCETON'S MOST DELIVERY COMPANY SPACE WITH A CAP AT A DEFLECTED THE DELIVERY. ADDED FEES BECAUSE RESTAURANTS BILLS DEFAULT HURTING RESTAURANTS AS WELL INCOME FROM DELIVERY DRIVERS. EITHER CONCERN RELATES TO THE TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS. RESTAURANTS HAVE A CHOICE WHEN THEY PARTNER WITH DELIVERY SERVICE PROVIDERS. MANDATING TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS COULD CREATE A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ALSO DETERRED DELIVERIES. RESEARCH BY SAID WHY. AT THE UNIVERSITY MISC SYSTEMS CANCER ARE PRETTY AFFECTED NOT JUST BY THE CALL OF GOOD OR SERVICE ALSO BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE COSTUME THEY ARE MADE EXPLICIT. REFERENCE ONE OF THE DRIVERS ARE PAID ENOUGH THAT RESTAURANTS NOT CHARGED MUCH SERVICES NOT CONSUMERS TEND TO FREQUENT ESTABLISHMENTS DURING THE- THESE ARE ALL COMPETING FORCES EVENT OCCUR CONCOMITANT CAN'T COMMITMENT LAKE.

BUT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR A WHILE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FEE CAP BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN ATTRACTION OF THE SHOW. IS THAT OPEN UP AND DOWN THE STATE- WELL EVEN I BEGAN TO SAY CITIES AND COUNTIES INCLUDING BOTH MY COUNTIES I DISTRICTS. HAVE ENACTED 15% FEE CAPS FOR THE DRAINER OF THE PANDEMIC. BECAUSE THEY HEARD THE VOICES OF TONS OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT SAID THEY WERE BEING EXPLOITED. WITH HIGH FEES. AND THIS IS WHY CIT COUNCILS. AND LOCAL BUSINESSES AND EVERYONE RALLIED TO GET THIS TICKET STARTS WHITE SAID SO HOW WIDESPREAD. AND TO HAVE THAT UNIFORMITY.

WHAT DAY BOB UP THERE CAN BE. AT WHAT BULK OF THEIR FEES AGAIN BECAUSE THEY IS NO GOOD. THAT THEY CAN START AGAIN. GO BEYOND 15% AND CHARGE RESTAURANTS REPORTERS. AND STILL CHARGE CUSTOMERS EXTRA PRICE THEY CAN MAKE A DOUBLE PROFIT OFF THIS AND I WAS THERE HERE TO ANSWER THAT. IS MY BET IS THEY'RE GOING TO DO BOTH OF THEM AND RE DOUBLE PROFIT- BUT YOU KNOW THE BILL STILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT HAS A GREAT TRANSPARENCY FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND WHO THEY'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH. WHAT THOSE FEES GO TO. BUT ULTIMATELY STILL THIS. YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE ONLY PLATFORMS ARE IMPORTED IN CONGRESS NOW THE DIGITAL AGE IN THE MODERN AGE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT BUSINESSES SHOULD COUPLE WE SUBMIT TO THE WILL. OF THESE BIG PLATFORMS. SO THE BILL SO REALLY IMPORTANT STEP AND I URGE I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT- I REALLY WANT TO THANK. SOMEONE. GONZALEZ FOR HIS WORK ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER BENNETT GO AHEAD. THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT THAT STILL REMAIN IN THIS BILL I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND ONE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE TIPS- AND THE MANIPULATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THAT AND THAT'S JUST JUST ESSENTIAL. AND THEN THE INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IS. AT LEAST A MOVES THE NEEDLE OF FURTHER ALONG FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MAYBE IS GOING ON. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE BILL. SO ARE SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FOR CARRYING THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH OUR- A TEAM AND- AND TAKING THE AMENDMENTS IS ALSO. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT REALLY- YOU KNOW GETTING A LOT OF- IMPORTANT SO GOING FORWARD SO. SO I URGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE CAN HELP WITH THE PLEASE LET US KNOW. SO WE GOT TO FEEL FREE TO CLOSE AN OR TRY SOME OF THE ISSUES. IF YOU SEE THANK YOUNG- YOU KNOW IT. SOMETIMES WE SIT HERE AND HAVEN'T HEARD FROM INDIVIDUALS AND SUDDENLY THEY'RE IN OPPOSITION WITHOUT A LOT OF EXPLANATION WHY SO. I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED TO HEAR THE LATINO RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION TO SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN LATINO COMMUNITY. AND HAS A TON OF LATINO OWNED RESTAURANTS IN MY DISTRICT I THOUGHT HOW STRANGE I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THEM. SO WHEN ON THE WEBSITE WHILE THEY WERE TALKING. AND I FIND THAT IN FACT THEY THEY CLAIM THAT THEIR PARTNERS ARE WALMART DOORDASH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS TEMPERATE. UTILITIES. VALERO OIL. SO IN FOR. I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE TALKING TO RESTAURANTS AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE- THAT IS WHAT I'VE SPENT MY TIMEDOING DURING THIS PANDEMIC IS. ACTUALLY TALKING TO THE SMALL MOM AND POP RESTAURANTS IN MY COMMUNITY. AND OVERWHELMINGLY THEY KNOW THESE ARE PROBLEMS. OVERWHELMINGLY THEY YES SUPPORT A CAP. AND IF NOT A CAP AT LEAST A TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING DIFFERENT STORIES FROM THE DELIVERY COMPANIES. AND THEIR CUSTOMERS AND THE DRIVERS ON WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING. ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS- AT THIS BILL THE KIND OF GUY IT WAS HARD TO SEE BUT IT ALSO PREVENTS THE CUT THE- THE COMPANIES FROM PROVIDING. ADDING THEIR OWN COST TO THE MENU ITEMS BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD THAT AS WELL YOU KNOW AS- AS THE SMALL VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT- THAT I ENJOY GOING TO SAYS YOU KNOW YOU CAN PURCHASE SPRING ROLLS FOR SEVEN NINETY NINE YET IF YOU DO IT THROUGH DOORDASH SOMEHOW THAT. BECAME NINE NINETY NINE AND THAT'S NOT THE RESTAURANT DOESN'T EVEN NECESSARILY KNOW THAT'S HAPPENING SO THERE ARE TRANSPARENCY ISSUES IN THIS TYPE OF THING. AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR OUR SMALL COMMUNITIES THERE'S ONE OTHER THING I CANNOT AS A FORMER. ADVOCATE I CANNOT LEAVE WITHOUT SAYING. IT IS BEYOND ME THE DOOR DASH THEMSELVES CAN'T COME HERE AND TALK ABOUT THEIR HISTORY BY THE WAY LAST NOVEMBER OF BEING CAUGHT RED HANDED IN STEALING TIPS FROM THEIR BAY AREA WORKERS AND BEING FORCED TO PAY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BUT INSTEAD STRONG ARMS OR MANIPULATES OR THREATENS THEIR OWN DRIVERS TO COME AND SAY THEY DON'T WANT A BILL THAT SAYS THEY GET THEIR TIPS. GIVE ME A BREAK IN OF DOORDASH HAD ANY CREDIBILITY THEY THEMSELVES WOULD COME AND ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE IMPETUS FOR THE TIP PORTION OF% THIS BILL. AND SO LIKE YOU MISTER LEE THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. FOR THE OTHER ANCILLARY GROUPS THAT SOMEHOW OUR POSES AND I CAN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO COME TO MY OFFICE AND TALK TO ME. YOU KNOW THERE WERE THERE WERE GROUPS THAT. THE SIGHT SEEING THEM OPPOSE. OR SUPPORT PROP TWENTY TWO I HAVEN'T SEEN AT ALL ON THIS ISSUE SO I'D LOVE TO TALK TO THEM. DEEPER YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY BE CHURCHES- OR CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS BUT- IT JUST SEEMS VERY SUSPECT. THAT WE HAVE GROUPS THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN FOR. WORKING CLASS. PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT'S TO THESE DRIVERS ARE IN ARE POSING A BILL THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THEY GET THE TIPS AT THE CUSTOMER. ACTUALLY MEANT TO GO TO THEM. SO I'M A LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE OPPOSITION TO HIM SORRY BUT YOU KNOW LET'S HAVE HONEST DISCUSSIONS LET'S LET'S KNOW WHO WERE TALKING TO AND IT'S A LITTLE HARDER WHEN THEY'RE NOT EVEN HERE IN PERSON. BUT IF YOU KNOW DOOR DASH OPPOSES BILL OBVIOUSLY THEY DO THEY'RE DOING IT THROUGH EIGHT OTHER DIFFERENT SOURCES. THEN COME DOWN AND LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION. BUT SENDING OTHER PEOPLE PRETENDING THAT IT'S SOMEHOW GRASSROOTS OPPOSITION IS JUST DISINGENUOUS. I HOPE WE CAN. GET SOME. HONEST CONVERSATIONS GOING WITH THESE COMPANIES AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CLOSING AND WITH THAT- MR SECRETARY THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS AB TWO EIGHT SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE FLOOR. CHAP HI CHECK OUT HI KILEY. BAUER K. HAND. POWER QUE HAN AYE BENNETT AYE BENNETT AYE CARILLO. CUNNINGHAM CUNNINGHAM HI GABRIEL. GALLAGHER IRWIN. LEE LEE HIGHWAY X. YOU HAVE FIVE VOTE SO WILL BE DEVELOPING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE. ALL RIGHT SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT AUTHOR AND I BELIEVE THIS MISTER LEAD EUROPE BY. AND WE HAVE- A. B. FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR- ITEMS SEVENTEEN. THE THEY'RE RELEVANT TO HAVE BACK TO BACK DISCUSSIONS SURE. OKAY ANYTIME YOU'RE READY OKAY MAYBE GET THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING VERY HARD WITH MY TEAM ON OUR LANGUAGE AMENDMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO SEND EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I INTRODUCED THIS BILL AB FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR FOR A FEW REASONS FIRST TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ENSURE THEY ARE EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED WHEN THEY MAKE FINANCIAL CHOICES ON WHO THEY'RE DOING BUSINESS WITH. SECOND IS TO PROTECT OUR LOCAL RESTAURANTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVASTATED BY THIS PANDEMIC. MANY BUSINESSES HAVE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO BECOME MORE RELIANT ON THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM TO SURVIVE DURING THE PANDEMIC. ECONOMY AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS. SINCE RESTAURANTS ARE EXISTENTIALLY RELY ON THESE SERVICES THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY IN BARGAINING POWER BETWEEN THE PLATFORMS AND RESTAURANTS WHEN THE AVERAGE PROFIT MARGIN OF OPERATING A RESTAURANT IS ONLY THREE TO FIVE PERCENT. SMALL RESTAURANTS BEING CHARGE UPWARDS OF 30% ON FOOD DELIVERY ORDERS CHIPS AWAY AT THEIR ALREADY DWINDLING MARGINS DESPITE GROWING COMPETITION THE SPACE. THE FOOD DELIVERY INDUSTRIES PRIMARILY CONTROLLED BY FOUR COMPANIES. OVER EATS POSTMATES DOORDASH AND GRUBHUB AND AS OF LAST MONTH THESE FOUR COMPANIES WITH BILLIONS IN VENTURE CAPITAL BACKING CONTROL 99% OF SALES IN THE FOOD DELIVERY MARKET. THIS DOMINANCE IS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN THE FILING OF A CLASS ACTION ANTITRUST LAWSUIT THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THIS LAWSUIT AMONG OTHER THINGS CLAIMS THESE FOUR COMPANIES BARELYCOMPETED ALL CONSPIRE TO KEEP COMMISSIONS HIGH AND KOREA WAGES LOW. DURING THE PANDEMIC IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BIG TECH MONOPOLIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS NEW REALITY WHILE I RESTAURANTS OF STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE. AND DO THAT IS IN A PUBLIC AND MISINFORMED NARRATIVES SURROUNDING COVER NINETEEN THESE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN FELT EVEN HARDER BY ASIAN AND ASIAN OWNED RESTAURANTS. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC OVER FORTY THOUSAND RESTAURANTSHAVE CLOSED THEIR DOORS IN CALIFORNIA. ASIAN RESTAURANTS HAVE HAD A FAR HIGHER RATE CLOSURE THE NON ASIAN RESTAURANTS AND IT'S EVEN REPORT THAT ROUGHLY HALF OF ALL CHINESE RESTAURANTS. IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE CLOSE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF PANDEMIC. IT IS IMPERATIVE WE PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TOOLS IN PROTECTIONS TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES SO THEY ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE RECOVER AND THRIVE WE MUST ENSURE THEY'RE NOT BE EXPLOITED BY BIG TECHNOPOLIS. AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE THE SILICON VALLEY CHAMBER COALITION ALONG WITH THE MOUNTAIN VIEW CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND HISPANIC SILICON VALLEY CHAMBER SUPPORTING. ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR THIS BILL. AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ENTER MY WITNESS IN SUPPORT.

FROM THE RESTAURANT SO THEY CAN GET OUT OF THE RESTAURANT AND THAT GET PAID MORE YELP AND GRUBHUB DECIDED THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHARGE THE REFERRAL FEE. WITHOUT ADDING MORE SERVICES. IT'S ACTUALLY A TRACK BY THE BIG CORPORATIONS AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD BE PROTECTED COMING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS AND ALL THE WORK.

HI GOOD MORNING SURE NUMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS HANNAH SMITH ON BEHALF OF GRUBHUB GRUBHUB FIRMLY BELIEVES IN A FUTURE WHERE THERE IS A VIBRANT AND GROWING RESTAURANT COMMUNITY THAT IS ABLE TO BALANCE IN PERSON AND OVER THE OPTIONS FOR DINERS AND WE SEE OURSELVES AS PART OF THAT COMMUNITY NGUYEN AND ALONGSIDE A RESTAURANT PARTNERS. HOWEVER OPPOSED IT EIGHT. MEN AT THIS POINT WE JUST. WE'RE NOT TAKING TESTIMONY SO. WE JUST ASKING FOR NAME. AND ALSO THE ORGANIZATION. ALL HE DID OKAY SO ALREADY SO I APOLOGIZE SALUTE PLEASE CONTINUE THEN IF THERE'S A REGISTER BECAUSE I WASN'T TOO. I GOT YOU OKAY POLICE TO CONTINUE THAT I'M SORRY MY APOLOGIES. THANK YOU OKAY- PROBABLY HUNDRED EIGHTY FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR AND DRAFTED THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT WEBSITES FROM LISTING PHONE NUMBERS FOR DINERS TO ORDER THROUGH GRUBHUB WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT SERVICE THAT OUR RESTAURANT PARTNERS CHOOSE TO CONTRACT WITH UP TO PROVIDE. PHONE ORDER YOUR CRITICAL SERVICE MAKING OUR PLATFORM MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE MORE COMFORTABLE USING A PHONE AND A COMPUTER. WHAT IF THE NATION IF ANYTHING IF THE TECHNOLOGY DOESN'TALWAYS WORK AND PHONE NUMBERS ARE NECESSARY BACK UP. IT CURRENTLY AT EIGHTY FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR IS UNTENABLE AND IN WHAT CAN ONLY BE INTERPRETED AS A SINGULAR FOCUS TO REMOVE GRANDPA'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT PHONE ORDERS. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT HE INTENDED TO SELL WHAT TO GUARANTEE THAT RESTAURANTS ARE ONLY CHARGE FOR PHONE ORDERS THAT RESULT IN AN ACTUAL ORDER. IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THE SAME AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION WITH THE BALLPARK THERE. IT ENABLE THE CONTINUED DINER AND RESTAURANT CONNECTION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- OTHER. ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION AT THIS POINT. MISTER CAREY HAVE NO FOR COMMENT THAT THAT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND THAT'S BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE MISBAH CAN. I HAD FOR LEE I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PRACTICE UNTIL I WAS READING THIS LAST NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER ORDERING FOOD YELP AND FELT. INCREDIBLY GUILTY AND I'M A CONSUMER WHO ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M FREQUENTING MY LOCAL- SMALL RESTAURANTS GOES OUT OF MY WAY TO PICK IT UP TO ENSURE THAT THE RESTAURANT IS GALLIC GETTING THE FULL VALUE OF. MY BUSINESS AND TO KNOW THAT I HAD. BASICALLY BEEN DUPED INTO TAKING SOME OF THAT PROFIT AWAY FROM MY LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS WAS PRETTY UPSETTING TO ME- AND SO I THINK THIS IS A PRACTICE I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. THERE'S TRANSPARENCY AND CONSUMERS CAN MAKE THE CHOICE IT'S JUST AS EASY FOR ME TO GO ON THE WEBSITE AND CALL THEM DIRECTLY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE THIS FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT. HURTING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN A WAY THAT IS UNNECESSARY. THANK YOU. YES WE GET- MISCONDUCT. THIS THE PRACTICE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT WAS WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ABOUT HAD JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN YOU'RE SORT OF ARE EXPECTING THIS TO BE THE DIRECT NUMBER- FOR THE RESTAURANT IT'S INSTEAD- IT IS ROUTED THROUGH SAY GRUBHUB AND SOTHEY GET TO TAKE A KIND OF ANY RESULTING PROCIDA COMMISSION JUST WHETHER OR NOT YOUR THAT'S THE IDEA RENDON AND SO. SO WHAT IS A DILIGENT USE OF ROBOT MAYBE A QUESTION FOR GRUBHUB OUT THERE HERE. WHAT WHAT IS THAT THE- OF WHAT IS I MEAN YEAH I S. THAT YOU HAVE A BROADER- YOU KNOW FUNCTIONALITY. ARE YOU STILL ON THE LINE MOST. OF YOU GET THE NAME OF THE PERSON. WEBER. THE OPERATOR CAN YOU CHECK TO SEE IF- THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM GRUBHUB IS STILL ON THE LINE. AT ALL. CAN ONE MOMENT PLEASE. WHAT WHILE WE'RE WAITING FIFTY REPRESENTATIVES FROM FROM GRUBHUB IS STILL ON THE LINE HE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO WE CAN IDENTIFY YOUR LINE. YOU KNOW WE TRIED. I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER I'D BUY IT- QUESTION I GUESS I'VE USUALLY IS SO UNDER YOUR BILL THEY WOULD STILL GET A COMMISSION IF AN ORDER IS PLACED RIGHT BUT THAT DOESN'T SORT OF. SEEM TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IT IN THAT THAT ORDER MIGHT STILL HAVE ULTIMATELY BEEN PLACE BECAUSE IT WAS ROUTED THROUGH THIS YOU KNOW A YELP OR WHAT HAVE YOU- NUMBER AND SO. WHY IS THAT KIND OF WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN TAKE A CONDITION JUST KIND OF THE ARBITRARY FACT OF THE CUSTOMER PLACES AN ORDER AS OPPOSED TO SORT OF- YOU KNOW JUST TRYING TO STOP THIS PRACTICE ON THE FRONT END OF THE RE ROUTING. RIGHT IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION A CELERY KILEY SO MY BILL DOESN'T PREVENT THEM FROM STILL HAVING A CHARGE RIGHT- ESSENTIALLY AND TO MAYBE ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION YEP IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS KIND OF A DEAL BECAUSE I GREW UP UP ACTS AND OTHER AS ANOTHER INTERMEDIARY WITH AN EMBEDDED WITHIN YELP I'VE BEEN WITH DANIEL. SO WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE USING THE CALL SO WHEN YOU CALL FOR AN ORDER IS ONE NUMBER THAT MIGHT SAY POWER BANKRUPT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS SO THEY COULD BE TRACKING THAT ORDER AND USING THAT TRACKING THE ADJUSTER CHARGER RESTAURANT CORRECT BUT I'M THINKING AS AS A SELLER BARKING HANNAH NOTED IF MORE CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND THAT DIFFERENCE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT POWER BY GRUBHUB MEANS OR THIS TRACKING. J. MIGHT ALTER THEIR BEHAVIOR MORE SO IN CONTACT THE BUSINESS MORE DIRECTLY BECAUSE I THINK CONSUMERS HAVE A FAIR EXPECTATION THAT YELP IS ACTING LIKE A YELP PAGE IS ACTUALLY JUST FINDING THE CONTACT INFORMATION AND YOU ONE DOLLAR ORDER YOU HAD PROBABLY NO INTENTION THAT YOUR BILLING THE ACT THE RESTAURANT EXTRA ON TOP OF THAT SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IS IMPORTANT SO I GET THAT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY SHOULD THE ABILITY OF GRUBHUB TO CHARGE DEPEND UPON KIND OF THE ARBITRARY FACT OF WHETHER THAT. THE CUSTOMERS ENDS. UP PLACING THE ORDER NOT. I THINK THAT'S ACCESS QUESTION. WILL BILLS NOT TO EXTERRAN THEIR BUSINESS BUT CERTAINLY TO MAKE IT MORE TRANSPARENT AND CONSUMER FRIENDLY. BUT IT IS A VALID CONCERN. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YEAH MR PRATER WOULD YOU PLEASE. A DOUBLE CHECK TO SEE IF- THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM GRUBHUB IS STILL AROUND. I THINK WE HAVE AND WE HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM. WE HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM GRUBHUB AN ONLINE AT ASPEN WHICH I DID I WOULD LIKE TO RE ASK THE QUESTION OR DID THAT YOU HAVE THAT QUESTION. YEAH YOU DO YOU HAVE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE YOU BE APT GET SURE THANK YOU RIGHT. WHAT DID YOU SORT OF PROGRESS- YOU KNOW YOUR TAKE ON THE PRACTICE. RIGHT HERE AND- WHETHER THAT'S- SORT OF THE MAIN THING YOU DO AND HOW WHAT IS THAT SORT OF THAT. AFTER LABOR- CUSTOMER TO TAKE OF YOUR. ONE OF MANY SERVICES THAT GRUBHUB PROVIDES AND ALSO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS THAT THIS IS A SERVICE THAT OUR RESTAURANT PARTNERS CONTRACTING WITH US TO PROVIDE CARE IF THEY'RE FULLY AWARE OF THE PRACTICE- AND ESSENTIALLY ADDED CORD REFUGEES ITSELF AND THAT A MARKETING AND ADVERTISING ENGINE FOR RESTAURANTS AND FOR RESTAURANT PARTNERS. AND SO IT JUST GOES INTO THE ENTIRE TEAM OF ME WE WILL CHARGE COMMISSION ON NEEDS AND ON ORDERS THAT GRAB HAD GENERATED A PLATFORM- BUT WE WILL NOT CHARGE ORDERED YOU KNOW WE WON'T CHARGE RESTAURANT ORDER COMMISSION FOR- BURKE COLDER ORDERS THAT DON'T RESULT IN ORDER OR IN THE LEAD UP YOURSELF COULD NOT GENERATE. AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO PHONE ORDERS IN PARTICULAR THERE HAVE TO BE A SEPARATE PHONE NUMBER BECAUSE OTHERWISE HOW WOULD GRAB A BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT CRAP PUBLIC THE ONE THAT GENERATED A LEAD- AND SO IT'S A VERY BASIC OLD SCHOOL PRACTICE HONESTLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER MARKETING FIRMS IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN USING PHONE BATES ORDERING. SERVICES FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS HAVE USED- AND THIS IS SIMPLY A CONTINUATION ABOUT FOR OUR RESTAURANT PARTNERS AND AGAIN I WANT TO BE CLEAR IF THE PRACTICE IS DISCONTINUED OR ON ALLOWED WHICH IS THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IT IS RESTAURANTS WOULD LOSE THOSE ORDERS. THOSE ORDERS WERE NO LONGER BE COMING TO THE RESTAURANT AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE BILL PAPADAKIS AND ENGAGING% THEM AND WE'RE VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR OUR PARTNERSHIP ON THAT THANK YOU THINK THERE'S A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN GET YOU. THAT AS PRESENTLY DRAFTED ALL. IT DOES OF **** RESTAURANT BUSINESS. IN THIS CHAPTER I FEEL. ME JUST. YOUR GOING EASILY AT KILEY IDEX. YOU KNOW YELP IS THE ALL PAGES OF PLATFORM GRUBHUB IS A BETTER WITHIN IT. SO USER GO ON THE APP YELP THEY FOR RESTAURANTS THEY GO DON'T GO ON APP OF GRUB TO FIND RESTAURANTS SO. WHILE IT IS PART OF THE CONTRACT AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT RESTAURANTS ENTRANCE TO WHEN THEY TRY TO YOU KNOW COMPETE THEM. THE ONLINE MARKET PLACE IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO THEM BY THE SAME TIME. IT'S A CALLED A MARKETING. THREE ARE MARKING SERVICES QUITE A STRETCH BECAUSE YELP IS THE PLATFORM THAT DOES THE LISTING IN THE MARKETING. GRUBHUB IS JUST KINDA INTERMEDIARY SERVICE. SO WHY DOES GOPIS THEIR NUMBER AS OPPOSED TO THE REST OF SOMEBODY'S IT DESCRIBED LIKE MAKE IT EASIER. FOR THEM TO ABROGATE ALL THESE NUMBERS. THAT WOULD BE A VERY YELP. HAVE LIGHTED HE'S FOR. BUT I MEAN ALSO YOU KNOW I HAVE IT I IT I'VE A SUSPECT KNOW IT'S IT COMES DOWN TO HOW YOU CAN. MAKE MONEY IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT I MEAN THE MORE INTERMEDIARIES AND HIS TAX SYSTEM THEN YOU CAN MAKE MORE MONEY BUT- IF IT IS A GOOD QUESTION FORGET WHY THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN INTERMEDIARY. AND YOU HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH YELP. IF THAT MAKES IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND OR NOT IT IS IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WORK ON TOGETHER. OKAY I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PROHIBITING A PRACTICE THAT ACTUALLY ADDS VALUE FOR CONSUMERS LIKE IF. YOU KNOW THAT. YOU HAVE THESE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH EASIER ACCESS TO THE PHONE NUMBERS THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE- AND I'M- A LITTLE WORRIED THAT ANYTIME YOU INTERFERE WITH VOLUNTARY. ARRANGEMENTS LIKE THIS MAYBE WILL BE. UNDERMINING CONSUMER WELFARE AND THAT WAY. MR CUNNINGHAM FOLLOWED BY MISTER BENNETT YEAH THIS THIS MIGHT BE KIND OF A DUMB QUESTION BUT THAT DOES THIS BILL CHANGE ANYTHING. I'M KINDA NEW TO THE ORDERING FOOD THING THAT'S I MEAN ON ON AN APPLE. UNCERTAIN THAT TOP OF IT NOW I SEEM TO DO ALL TIME BUT AS MANY PEOPLE I JUST GO ON GRUBHUB'S APP. AND THEN PICK MY RESTAURANT FROM THERE WITH THIS BILL CHANGE ANYTHING NO YOU WOULD GO ON THE YELP APP WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON LISTING SERVICE SO AS WE DEFINE THE BILL WE TALK ABOUT THE LISTING SERVICES- GRUBHUB IS JUST KIND OF THE INTIMATE PARTNER THAT DOES A LOT OF- ORDER FULFILLMENT- AND IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE THEY DON'T TECHNICALLY DELIVER THE FOOD EITHER THEY'RE JUST KINDA. IN THERE IN THE MIDDLE AND THIS BILL IS SIMPLY TO CLARIFY THAT THERE SHOULDN'T BE. A MISLEADING PHONE NUMBER BECAUSE IN THE PAST THIS IS A RECENT DEVELOPMENT GROWTH GRUB GRUB HUB SLASH YELL BECAUSE THEY WORKED IT LIKE THIS- DID LIST NUMBERS THAT WERE NOT REFLECTIVE SAY IF YOU WANT TO THE ACTUAL BUSINESSES WEBSITE OR LOOK AT THEIR MENU. THERE WITH DIFFERENT NUMBER BECAUSE ARE USING THAT TO TRACK AND NOW IT SEEMS THEY ARE USING THE SAME NUMBER BUT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DISCERN WHAT IS HAPPENING STILL SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED BUT YEAH YOU WOULD GO ON YELP AND YOU'D STILL BE ABLE TO FIND THE RESTAURANT BUT STILL BE THERE. THROUGH YOUR ISSUE IS IF I GO THROUGH HEALTH AND THEN I BET ON ON YELP THERE'S GRUBHUB'S SOMETHING YES IF YOU PRESS THE POWER BUTTON ALL YEAH AND THEN THE ORDER COUNTING. FOR AND THEY'RE STILL CHARGING THE RESTAURANT. SO WHAT HAPPENED THE PAST SAY YOU ON THE YOU PRESS THE CALL BUTTON KALRA. BUTTON AND CALLED ME LIKE- I'M- THIS A GLASS KNOWN AS RAJENDRA. HISTORICALLY THE- CALL BECAUSE IT GOT ROUTE AND AFTER. BIG STILL. THE RESTAURANT EVEN IF IT DID NOT RESULT IN ORDER BECAUSE THEY'RE CLAIMING. THAT THEY'RE GIVING GENERATING LEADS FOR THEM. WHEN IN FACT YOU GO ON. THE YELP WEBSITE TO FIND IT'S NOT LIKE GRUBHUB PROVIDED LEAVE INTEREST WAS THE SERVICE. OKAY I THINK I THINK THAT CLARIFIES IT YEAH THANK. CERTAINLY NOT SUPER INTUITIVE AS AS I HAVE COME TO LEARN TO AND THERE ARE A LOT OF INTERESTING PRACTICES THAT WERE NEGATIVE MISTER BENNETT. YEAH I WOULD JUST LIKE TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT- TO A LARGE EXTENT THIS IS AN ISSUE OF COMPETITION. AND THERE IS INSUFFICIENT COMPETITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND SO THE SMALL RESTAURANT. IS DOESN'T HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PLACES THEY COULD GO AND- HAVE THAT COMPETITION AND DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE- MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE BEING TREATED FAIRLY X. CENTER. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE CONSTANTLY CHANGING THE FACT THAT THERE'S INSUFFICIENT COMPETITION BECAUSE- THE ANTI TRUST LAWS IN THE APPLICATION OF ALL THOSE IS VERY SLOW AND CUMBERSOME. AND THIS TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING SO FAST I MEAN. MOST OF US AS AS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTED OUT TO A LAST NIGHT SHE WASN'T EVEN AWARE OF THIS RIGHT SO- THIS IS OFF THE RADAR SCREEN AND SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. TO TRY TO ADDRESS ONE. RELATIVELY SMALL PART OF INADEQUATE COMPETITION AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD AS- THE THERE'S A CONSTANT ATTEMPT TO BUY OUT YOUR COMPETITORS. WERE PARTNER UP WITH YOUR COMPETITORS SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THIS COMPETITION EVER INVOLVED AND SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ALWAYS BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND REALLY HAVE THE TO HAVE THESE KIND OF BILLS AND ACTIONS TO BE. A WAY OF TO BE ON NOTICE THAT YOU CAN'T. ABUSE YOUR MONOPOLISTIC POSITION IN THE MARKET PLACE YOU HAVE YOU SHOULD BE PROACTIVELY. FAIR WITH THE SMALL RESTAURANT AND SAY OKAY IF YOU DIDN'T GET AN ORDER WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THIS OR- OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT'S- THAT'S HOW I VIEW IT MORE FROM US. YOU KNOW TRYING TO COUNTER COUNTER BALANCE OF A GREAT IMBALANCE THAT IS OUT THERE THAT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ALL OF US TO TRY TO ADJUST IT IN THIS. FAST MOVING WORLD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WE GET OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IT IS JUST THE FASTENER HOW MANY MANY WAYS YOU COULD STAY TRANSACTION AND- IT'S JUST A VERY EYE OPENING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING OF THE BILL FOR IT AND ALONG WITH THE PREVIOUS BILL I THINK UP YOU KNOW I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT THIS A BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IN CANADA WELL THANK WITH DOING THAT TOO SO- AND HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW PRACTICES OUT THERE SO THAT THE I THINK THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED SO- FEEL FREE TO CLOSE. YEAH I'LL JUST SAY VERY BRIEFLY YOU KNOW IN MY SHORT TIME HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE COUPLE MONTHS I'VE COME TO REALIZE SOMETHING VERY- CLEARLY ONE OF THEM IS A DISPROPORTIONATE LOBBYING POWER OF BIG TECH CORPORATIONS IMMERSES OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE RELY ON EVERY DAY IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT MAKE IT SO UNIQUE AND VIBRANT AND MY BILL SIMPLY SIX TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF SMALL BUSINESS AGAINST ALL THE ODDS AND AS WE'VE COME TO LEARN PERSONALLY ANALYZE AND SOLVE BUSINESSES INDEPENDENT MAKE CHANGE A LOT OF OUR DINING HABITS RIGHT MANY OF US WOULD NEVER HAVE ORDAINED TO THINK ABOUT GOING ON AN APP. AND ORDERING THAT WAY WHEN YOUR BUSINESS IS NEVER STRUCTURE THE BUSINESS AROUND THAT EITHER AND TO STAY COMPETITIVE AND TO STAY ALIVE DURING THESE VERY DIFFICULT TIMES DAVE THEY LOOK TO THESE APPS AND SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT AS TRANSPARENT OR ST FORT IS A THOUGHT I CAN TELL YOU THIS BILL CAME BECAUSE ONE DAY I ORDERED. A MEAL VIA YELP GRUBHUB AND HE ALMOST CUSSED ME OUT BECAUSE HE WANTED HEALTHY IS HEADED EVEN THOUGH HE'S LIKE THOUGHTS ALL HORRIBLE OF ALL THESE THINGS AND EVERYBODY KNOW THAT AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THE MANY GREAT ASIAN SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING ALREADY SO- I WANT TO THANK THAT CONSTITUENT FOR BRING THIS TO MY ATTENTION VERY VIVIDLY AND I WANNA I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM. MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AT THIS. AB ONE FOR. FOUR THE MOST. IS DUE. AS A- TO FLOOR. CHECK OUT HI CHAO I KILEY. KILEY NOT VOTING BARRICADE HAND ARE QUE HAND AYE BENNETT. BENNETT I CARILLO.

HE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. ALL RIGHT. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE AB TWO SIX H. EIGHT WHICH WILL PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF MY MURDERED CONSTITUENTS WHO DID IN THE BORDERLINE MASS SHOOTING AB TWO SIX EIGHT IS BASED ON EXISTING LAW THAT ALLOWS FAMILIES TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THEIR MURDERED LOVED ONES AND IS BALANCED AND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF RECORDS WILL REMAIN PRIVATE PUBLIC. AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE BORDERLINE MASS SHOOTING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION THE PUBLISHED REPORTS BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND THE SHERIFF AND MULTIPLE NEWSPAPER STORIES THESE FAMILIES CONTINUE TO BE TORMENTED BY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS REQUESTING AUTOPSY RECORDS. THEY ARE INTENT ON DISTORTING THE MEMORY OF THESE VICTIMS THROUGH HURTFUL AND OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS ON MESSAGE BOARDS CLAIM THAT THE VICTIMS OF MASS SHOOTINGS ARE CRISIS pLIVING OVERSEAS AB TWO SIX EIGHT AMENDS AN EXISTING LAW THAT ALREADY ALLOWS FAMILIES OF MURDERED CHILDREN TO PETITION A COURT TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN'S AUTOPSY SEALED. I WANT TO APPLIES TO A DEATH THAT IS THE RESULT OF A CRIMINAL ACT AND NOT OF NATURAL CAUSES AN ACCIDENT OR ONE THAT IS SELF INFLICTED. EIGHTY TWO SIX EIGHT SIMPLY EXTENDS THE AUCTION ALREADY OFFERED TO FAMILIES OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE CHILD VICTIMS WHO DIED FROM A CRIMINAL ACT TO VICTIMS OF ALL AGES IT IS A CRUCIAL SAFEGUARD FROM AGAIN FROM- THE L. A. RETAINS A CRUCIAL SAFEGUARD FROM THE EXISTING LAW THAT IS SEALED CANNOT BE REQUESTED UNTIL AFTER A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IS SECURED HOWEVER IT ADDS THE IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVE THAT A SEAL CAN BE SOUGHT AFTER A CASES CLOSED BY PROSECUTORS DUE TO ALL SUSPECTS BEING DECEASED. AFTER ALL NO CONVICTION WILL EVER BE SECURED AGAINST A MASS SHOOTER WHO TAKES HIS OWN LIFE AS WAS THE CASE OF BORDERLINE TWENTY OTHER STATES PROVIDE FAMILY SOME DEGREE OF PRIVACY BY KEEPING ALL AUTOPSY RECORDS.

FROM AS JOURNALISTS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND THAT'S OFTEN. RARELY PRETTY. WE HAVE READ THE AFTER ACTION REPORT INVENTOR COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. BEING INVESTIGATED REPORTS OF INTER COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE AUTOPSY REPORTS. FOR SERGEANT RON HE WITH THE SHOOTER. WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED ON NOVEMBER SEVENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED SO FAR WHICH URETER PRODUCED BY THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. OR MORE BASED ON THE MATERIALS- THIS IS A PERSONAL THE SEEKING A PUBLIC RECORDS. IT'S. PROFESSIONAL IT'S OUR JOB. ONE OF OUR MANDATE THIS REPORT AND EDITORS OF TO HOLD. ACCOUNTABLE AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THIS INSTANCE WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR POLICE MISCONDUCT RECORDS FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND EVERY OTHER AGENCY LAKE COUNTY HAS HANDED OVER AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE- I CAN'T LOOK INTO THE HEARTS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND- IF THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT FROM US BECAUSE OF SOME SUPPOSED. TO INCLUDE. ASSEMBLY LINE OR NOT BUT I HOPE WE CAN AGREE THAT WE AS A SOCIETY ARE BETTER WITH GREATER GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY. NOT LESS. THE OF THE TERM CRIMINAL IN THE BILL. IN MY MIND IS TOO BROAD. TOO MANY PEOPLE DIE AS A RESULT OF CRIMES TO HEAD- AUTOPSY REPORTS HELP US DO OUR JOB. THEY SHOW A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE EVENTS. THAT WE GET THE DOCUMENTS AND THERE'S NOTHING THERE DO NOT WHAT WE WILL TELL YOU TELL THE TRUTH. I HOPE THAT'S WHAT WE LEARNED. BUT WHAT IF WE LEARN MORE. WHAT IF WE WANT SOMETHING TO HELP OTHER AGENCIES PREVENT MORE MASS SHOOTINGS AND EVENTS- AND BETTER UNDERSTAND TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING AS PREVIOUSLY UNSTOPPABLE LIKE THIS.

MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD THANK YOU LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MR GABRIEL AT. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- FIGURE SOMETHING WOMAN FOR THIS BILL- AND INTEREST FOR THE EXTERNALLY COMPASSIONATE AND THOUGHTFUL WAY THAT YOU HAVE. SUPPORTED THE BORDERLINE FAMILIES THIS IS YOU KNOW I SPENT SOME TIME THERE IS A- AS A KID AND THIS IS ONE THAT HIT HOME FOR ME AS WELL AND- JUST MY- EXTERNALLY CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY AND THE WITNESS I'M- NOT PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY- WE DID WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT I JUST WANTED TO. RAISE THE POINT ON THE RECORD. I THINK IN MOST INSTANCES YOUR BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO- BUT WE ARE BALANCING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS HERE THERE'S A VERY STRONG EVERYTHING MOST CASES OVERRIDING INTEREST IN PRIVACY FOR THE FAMILY. BUT THERE MAY BE AN ONE OUT OF A THOUSAND OR ONE OUT OF TEN THOUSAND CASES- REALLY STRONG INTEREST IN THE OTHER DIRECTION RIGHT FOR PUBLIC INTEREST FOR FIRMWARE ANDERSON SO I WOULD JUST OFFER TO YOU- IF YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT AND ENTERTAIN THE POSSIBILITY. OF MAYBE TRYING TO CARVE OUT AN EXCEPTION WHERE. AFTER AFTER THIS HAPPENS IF SOMEONE COULD GO TO COURT A PETITION THE JUDGE YOU COULD SET A VERY VERY HIGH THRESHOLD IN THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE INSIDE. IF THERE'S OVERRIDING PUBLIC INTEREST AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION JUST TO CREATE A LITTLE BIT OF A RELEASE VALVE FOR THAT ONE IN TEN THOUSAND SITUATION WHERE. IT REALLY DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW SO I WILL LEAVE THAT TO YOUR DISCRETION AND JUDGMENT I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN YOU AS AN AUTHOR- AND BUT JUST WANTED TO RAISE THAT ON THE RECORD AND- WE'LL BE PLEASED TO SUPPORT ABOUT THE FACT. RIGHT THANK YOU. AS MEMBER- GABER. AND I WAS LOOKING AT AFTER YOU RAISE ISSUE WE- WE CERTAINLY ARE OPEN TO. ANY LANGUAGE THAT IN THAT. AGAIN THIS IS VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED SO IN THAT INSTANCE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE. A PUBLIC NEED TO KNOW- BUT I JUST WANT TO GO THROUGH WHAT THE BILL SAYS RIGHT NOW THE DEATH CERTIFICATE IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE THAT'S THE NAME AGE CAUSE AND MANNER OF DEATH. AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF ENTITIES ALSO THAT'S A MIGHT HAVE A NEED TO KNOW. THAT ARE ALLOWED TO VIEW THE AUTOPSY RESULTS ARE READY SO THAT'S- LAW ENFORCEMENT PROSECUTORS SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES. HOSPITALS THAT TREATED THE VICTIMS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. CIVIL ATTORNEYS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND LASTLY. ANY FAMILY MEMBER. CAN ACTUALLY I REQUEST TO HAVE THE RECORD UNSEALED SO. ONE FAMILY MEMBER CAN REQUEST HAVE IT SEALED IF ANOTHER ONE REQUEST TO HAVE IT UNSEALED. THEN YOU DO GO TO COURT FOR THAT SO- WE WILL TO CONTINUE TO LOOK IF THERE'S- IF THERE'S- SOME WAY TO. TO HAVE THAT ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARD AND THAT VERY RARE INSTANCE. BUT AGAIN THIS WAS EXTREMELY NARROWLY- TAILORED. TO ACTIVE SITUATED IT'S NOT WE DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE OFTEN VIEWS. MUCH BEYOND SITUATIONS LIKE A BORDERLINE. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT AND MY COMPLIMENTS YOU HAVE CRAFTED THIS VERY NARROWLY AS IT. AS IT EXISTS SO I APPRECIATE HAT AND- AGAIN THIS IS REALLY JUSTICE AS WE DISCUSSED LAST NIGHT THAT ONE IN TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASE FOR THE JUSTICE SOME VERY. OVERRIDE STRONG OVERRIDING PUBLIC INTEREST THAT THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO ENGAGE IN ABOUT THE PAST AND FIGURE OUT WHICH IS WHICH IS THE PRIVATE INTERESTS OF. SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. YEAH C. NO OTHER CA. THE SUPPORT. MISTER MISTER. AND IF ALL MR BEEN. YEAH COUNTY GANG UP ON THE SOME MEMBER. COME I DO THINK THAT MIGHT BE A WORTHY. ADDITION I MEAN I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THOUGH UNDER THE BILL AS DRAFTED NOW- THE RECORDS CAN STILL BE USED IN A CRIMINAL CASE BY PROSECUTION AND DEFENCE. IN A CIVIL THE CIVIL LITIGANTS CAN STILL GET ACCESS RIGHT. AND SO I MEAN IT ANYBODY THAT. NEEDS TO USE IT FOR PURPOSES OF COURT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE RECORDS- FAMILY MEMBER HAS TO REQUEST IT RIGHT. SO I MEAN UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE- THIS THE CEILING ISN'T REQUESTED IT DOESN'T APPLY IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY YEAH I MEAN I CAN'T I'M TRYING TO. THINK HYPOTHETICALLY OF THAT ONE IN TEN THOUSAND SITUATION IT'S HARD FOR ME TO EVEN. THINK OF THE HYPOTHETICAL BUT I THINK IT MIGHT EXISTS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. WHERE IT WHERE SOMEBODY FROM THE MEDIA FOR EXAMPLE WOULD WANT- YOU KNOW SOME NEW EVIDENCE COMES OUT ABOUT THE OJ CASE OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW. AND SOMEBODY FROM THE MEDIA WOULD WANT. TO PETITION A COURT FOR ACCESS IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING THAT I WOULD AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FROM SAN GABRIEL OR WHATEVER FROM- THAT THAT- IS GABRIEL AND I THINK. I MIGHT. OTHERS SAY ALLAH. THOUSAND OAKS THING- THAT'S YOU THE I AGREE THAT I THINK THE THRESHOLD SHOULD BE REALLY REALLY HIDE IT SHOULD- AND IT SHOULD REQUIRE A JUDICIAL BALANCING TEST AND GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- THE PETITIONER THAT THE VICTIM FAMILY MEMBER THE PETITION TO HAVE IT SEALED TO ALSO HAVE A CHANCE TO COME IN AND EXPLAIN TO A JUDGE WHY IT SHOULD BE RELEASED. SO JUST SOME THOUGHTS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL BUT AND WE'RE CERTAINLY TO IT YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE BOTH ATTORNEYS WE HAVE ASKED THE OPPONENTS FOR LANGUAGE THAT THAT MIGHT BE- THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR LANGUAGE LIKE THAT YEAH I THINK THEY SHOULD WORK WITH YOU AND OFFER THEM. THANK YOU. MISTER SEVEN MEMBER COME. UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM. CHAIRMAN I WAS A VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR ONE BORDERLINE THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE I WAS ONE OF THE SUPERVISORS IN THE UNANIMOUS VOTE TO ASK- MISTER WOULD CARRY THIS BILL WHILE I WAS ON THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- AND AT THAT AS SHE STARTED CARRIED ABILITY AS WE WERE MAKING THE REQUEST WE CERTAINLY HEARD- FROM THE NEWSPAPERS ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHERS THAT- IT'S- AN OPPOSITION TO THE TO THE REQUEST. AND I THINK IN A GOOD GOVERNMENT IS IT IS ALWAYS THE HARDEST WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD READ PRINCIPLES ON BOTH SIDES OF PRIVACY OF THESE FAMILIES WE WERE ALL TRYING TO SAY THESE FAMILIES NEED SOME PRIVACY IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THE NEWSPAPERS ARE SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT IF IT'S A FOSTER CHILDREN AND THERE'S A YEAH THE GOVERNMENT IS COVERING UP- YOU KNOW SOME SOME BEST A AND SO I JUST REALLY WANT TO COMPLIMENT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THOUSAND OAKS- FOR NARROWLY I FEEL REALLY NARROWLY CRAFTING MISSING TO PROTECT THOSE FAMILIES. IS IN FOR IT THE BORDERLINE FAMILIES IN PARTICULAR BUT OTHER FAMILIES AND IN A SIMILAR SITUATION IN A WAY THAT AT LEAST THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE AS SHE'S BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABUSED- SO HAVE A FAMILY ONCE THE AUTOPSY INFORMATION OUT THEY CAN'T SO IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEY SUSPECTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE SOMETHING WRONG. THERE'S BEEN A SHOOTING- OF ONE OF THEIR VICTIMS BY- THE POLICE OR SOMEBODY ELSE- SO JUST THERE'S A THERE'S A GREAT EMPHASIS ON THE FAMILY IS PROTECTED IN TERMS OF GETTING THE INFORMATION OUT IN THE PLANT FAMILY ONLY NARROWLY CAN CAN PROTECT THIS INFORMATION IN IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND SO MY COMPLIMENTS- AND- THERE IS THE YOU KNOW THE DEMAND FOR THE PERFECT WILL ALWAYS BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD AND- AND NOT THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S ANYTHING. WRONG WITH THE SUGGESTION YOU HAVE HERE BUT I THANK YOU IS IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL CHECK- EFFORT ON YOUR- TO. THIS DOWN SO I CERTAINLY BE STRONGLY. SUPPORTING THE EFFORT TO MIKE BUT MOSTLY MY PERSONAL I MEAN MY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL COMPLIMENTS TO YOU FOR. COMING UP WITH A NOT JUST GIVING UP LAST YEAR WHEN YOU COULD GET IT. WITH THE BROADER VERSION OF IT BUT COMING UP WITH SOMETHING THAT GIVES HOPE STILL FOR THOSE FAMILIES- THE ABUSE THAT. HAS TAKEN PLACE HAS TO BE BALANCED AND THEY'VE THEY'RE SUBSUMED TERRIFIC ABUSES OF THIS AUTOPSY. INFORMATION HAS TO BE BALANCED WITH- WITH THE- WITH WITH THE PUBLIC- DESIRE FOR THE INFORMATION OR THE PUBLIC YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE AND I THINK YOU SHOULD BE STRUCK OF A VERY GOOD BALLOTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF MY CHAIR KILEY. THANK YOU AND- I REALLY- ECHO WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID IN TERMS OF. APPOINTING YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN IRWIN FOR WORKING WITH THESE FAMILIES WHO HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH SO MUCH AND I'VE HAD TO. YOU KNOW GO THROUGH THIS ABUSE OF. OF THE RECORDS IN THE PROCESS IT'S REALLY- JUST AWFUL AND- I THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE I THINK I WOULD HAVE TO COME DOWN. A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THOUGH THAN SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS- YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE CONCERNS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT GROUPS IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION- I THINK THERE WERE VERY COMPELLING AND I DON'T THINK IT'S YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF A ONE OF THOUSAND CASE WHERE THERE'S A MATTER OF WHERE THESE ARE A MATTER OF PUBLIC INTEREST I THINK THAT. ANYTIME YOU HAVE A HOMICIDE THE MATTER OF TREMENDOUS PUBLIC INTEREST AND- I DON'T THINK THAT THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE- YOU KNOW ONE OF LIMITING ACCESS ON THE PART OF THE PRESS OR ANY OTHER GROUP- THAT SEEKS TO. YOU KNOW- SHINE A LIGHT ON. VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE EVENT THAT MADE- YOU KNOW HAVE A RAMIFICATIONS FOR POLICY OR FOR- YOU KNOW- PROSECUTION OR FOR STEPS GOING FORWARD SO. I MEAN I'M- I JUST DON'T THINK I CAN SUPPORT THE BILL IN THE CURRENT FORM ONE SORT OF- YOU KNOW EVEN. ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT FOLKS ARE SUGGESTING OR MAYBE YOU CAN GO AND TRY TO- YOU KNOW MAKE A SHOWING THE YOU NEED TO GET ACCESS WHAT ABOUT SORT OF DOING IT THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THE A CASES WHERE YOU HAVE SORT OF. ROLES ARE YOU HAVE THIS PROCESS BEING ABUSES PROBABLY. THE RARE SCENARIO MAYBE I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT BUT COULD YOU SORT OF. LET THE DEFAULT SO THAT YOU COULD MAKE USE OF THAT YOU KNOW THE REDACTION- PROCEDURES THAT ARE ALREADY ARE THERE ANY EXISTING LAW AND MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A- A RARE CASE WE'RE NOT THE LAST PRIVACY INTERESTS ARE STILL- BEING VIOLATED A FURTHER STEP TO BE TAKEN. WELL THERE IS YEAH THERE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A- AN OPTION FOR REDACTION AND THE FAMILIES HAD NO- THEY HAD NO CONFIDENCE THAT THAT WOULD. BE USED TO PROTECT THAT AUTO C. RECORD. THAT THE- THAT THAT THAT THE ALL TALKED TALK RECORD AS A WHOLE NEW. TO BE. TO REALLY PROTECT THEIR THEIR INFORMATION. THEY LOOKED AT- THEY LOOK AT THE REACTION. AND IT HAD TO GO THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM IT'S NOT THAT WELL DEFINED WHEN YOU CAN USE IT AND- AND AGAIN. REALLY FOR PRIVACY YOU NEED TO- IF YOU NEED TO REALLY. I'M STILL THE ENTIRE RECORD AND AGAIN THIS THERE ARE ONLY CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS. THE PERSON THE MURDERER WOULD HAVE TO BE- I'M KILLED HIMSELF. AND IF YOU LOOK AT BORDERLINE IN VENTURA COUNTY WE HAVE HAD LITERALLY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF REPORTS IN THIS. COMMITTEE WE TALK ABOUT FOR INSTANCE THE HIPPA. MEDICAL INFORMATION IT WHICH IS THE MOST PRIVATE TYPE OF INFORMATION AND NOW YOU HAVE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO IF THEY WERE A COUPLE OF YEARS YOUNGER. THIS WOULDN'T EVEN BE AN ISSUE BECAUSE THE LAW IS ALREADY THERE BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE TWENTY AND NOT EIGHTEEN. THEIR HIP A RIGHTS AS SOON AS THEY WERE MURDERED. ARE VIOLATED AND THAT IS ARE THEY TAKING SOME SORT OF. DRUGS ARE THEY I MEAN. WHY SHOULD ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHEN SO MUCH OTHER INFORMATION HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCLOSED THE LAST LITTLE BIT OF DIGNITY THAT YOUR FAMILY HAS BE DISCLOSED. WHAT IS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT WHEN THERE'S A LIST OF TEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES I CAN ALREADY GET THE INFORMATION. WHAT IS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT WHAT WE SAW IN VENTURA COUNTY THERE WAS NO PUBLIC BENEFIT IT IS THE TROLLS I'VE HAD LETTERS OF MY HOUSE. PEOPLE IN THAT YOU KNOW THREATENING THE VICTIM'S FAMILY IT JUST AT A CERTAIN POINT WE NEED TO REMEMBER THERE WERE VICTIMS AND ALL THIS. SURE MISTER MIRACLE AND- HELLO THIS IS A MEMBER OF AUDIENCES THIS THIS IS RELATED TO. YOU CAN GET AFTER A GOOD ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU SAID YEAH HOMICIDES REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEY ARE. THAT'S WHY MESSAGE IN ERROR THAT'S RIGHT JUST LIKE TO ASK YOU ALL. TO MORE TIME. BOTH THERE WE GO HI ALL THOSE ELEGANT WAY YES WE PURSUE LOS IN THE DOES AIR YEAH. BUT- I JUST LIKE THE ALL TO REPEAT- ALL OF THIS THAT ARE REAL THAT ALREADY RESTRICTED IN OTHER WORDS THE THIS IS ONLY RESTRICTED IN COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT THE BASED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THE PERSON HAS TO BE DEAD YOU KNOW THE THAT THE SHOOTER HAS TO BE DEALT COULD COULD YOU DO THAT OKAY. EVERYTHING THAT THE SHOOTER HAS TO BE DEAD AND ALL THE OTHER INFORMATION IS RELEASED AND THAT THAT AND THERE ARE VICTIMS AND THERE ARE VICTIMS THAT ARE OVER EIGHTEEN SO WE'RE JUST EXTENDING THE SAME PROTECTION THAT WE DO FOR UNDER EIGHTEEN- GIRLS AND AGAIN THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF- DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT COULD. FOUR FOUR IF THEY HAVE A REASON TO KNOW ARE ABLE TO SEE THOSE AUTOPSY REPORTS AND AGAIN IN TWENTY DIFFERENT STATES THEY COMPLETELY HIDE THIS WITHOUT IT BEING A MURDER VICTIM BECAUSE THESE RECORDS ARE SO INCREDIBLY PERSONAL. SO I'M SORRY I GET A LITTLE WOUND UP IN FOR. FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT AND FOR ME WE LIVED THROUGH THIS WE HAVE BEEN WITH THE FAMILIES FOR THE YOU KNOW THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT ALL THE MEMORIAL SERVICES. AND THIS IS KIND OF THE FINAL INDIGNITY THAT THEY HAVE TO. THAT THAT THAT THE PERSONAL DETAILS OF THE BODIES OF THEIR CHILDREN- ARE TO BE REVEALED. SO BUT I CERTAINLY I BY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ALL IT'S A BALANCING ACT I KNOW APPRECIATE THE OTHER SIDE'S ARGUMENT CALL I JUST I JUST WANTED TO WANTED TO GO ON RECORD IT IF IT. IF YOU HAVE. A CAREFUL READING OF THE BILL WILL SHOW. THAT IN THE VAST VAST MAJORITY THIS BILL WILL JUST DOES THIS BILL WILL NOT OF NOT APPLY. SO OFTEN IT'S NOT MURDERS ARE IMPORTANT. AND NEARLY ALL THE MURDERS WILL STILL HAVE THE RELEASE OF THIS INFORMATION EXCEPT WHEN THE SHOOTER HAS. ALREADY ALREADY KILLED THEMSELVES FOR EXAMPLE AND IT IN THAT SITUATION AND THE FAMILY REQUEST YOU KNOW ONCE THE PRIVACY TO CONTINUE- SO. WHAT I THINK WE JUST NEED TO AIR THAT WE FINALLY REACHED A REASONABLY- YOU KNOW GOOD- ADJUSTMENT TO IT BALLOTS HERE WITH S. AND AGAIN MY COMPLIMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I WAS TOLD ME SAY THAT- MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE FAMILIES. WHO HAVE LOST LOVED THEIR LOVED ONES IT IS A TOUGH IT'S A TOUGH CALL FOR ME ALSO I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED BY SEVERAL COLLEAGUES OF OURS AND IS THE BALANCING ACT A HOW DO WE HOW DO WE START THAT RIGHT BALANCE AND YOU KNOW BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY IT BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND M.

THIS IS- AB TWELVE FIFTY TWO CORRECT MISTER CHOW THANK YOU YES CORRECT MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY-MUCH I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT FREE BUT THIS IS. A LOT OF AB FOR TWELVE FIFTY TWO WOULD BRING HEALTH INFORMATION COLLECTED BY DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS TO BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL PRIVACY LAW. OUR DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE GETTING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEW WAYS TO GET USEFUL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT. THEIR PATIENTS FOR EXAMPLE A DIGITAL AND MOBILE CONNECTED INHALER CAN DETECT WHEN THE DEVICE IS USED. MEASURE THE STRENGTH. OF THE USERS INHALATION AND ALSO TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION TO THE USERS DR. ALSO SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL PILLS ARE ALREADY IN USE. THESE PILLS COMBINED INGESTIBLE MICROCHIPS SENSORS WITH PHARMACEUTICALS. AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE PATCH THAT COLLECTS INFORMATION AND SENDS IT OVER TO A MOBILE APPLICATION. HOW THESE PRODUCTS CAN RECORD THE TIME AND QUANTITY A DRUG IS TAKEN ONCE TEMPERATURE ACTIVITY LEVEL AND HEART RATE. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION CAN BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND WOOD UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BE PROTECTED UNDER THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL AND INFORMATION ACT. AND THAT'S CALL C. M. I. A. AND ALSO HIT BUT WHICH HAS BEEN ALSO MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. NOW IN ORDER FOR THIS KIND OF DATA TO BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION IT NORMALLY NEEDS TO BE GENERATED BY A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. PROVIDER HOWEVER INFORMATION GENERATED OR COLLECTED BY A DIGITAL HEALTH APPS MEETING AT THE PATIENT LEVEL AND ALSO OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL FACILITY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE CAPTURE. UNDER THE EXISTING DEFINITION OF MEDICAL INFORMATION THIS BILL TWELVE FIFTY TWO WILL BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT UNDER THE CMI EIGHT BY CONSIDERING ANY BUSINESS THAT OFFERS SUCH AN APPLICATION OR DEVICE TO CONSUMER. TO BE A PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLE OF THE DEVICE. NOW THIS WILL ENSURE THAT SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA IS TREATED WITH THE SAME CARE AND AS DATA THAT IS GENERATED IN A TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SETTING.

I NEED TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT YOU CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH OUT FOR HELP WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THAT DATA MIGHT BE SHARED MISUSED CALIFORNIA PATIENT PRIVACY IS PROTECTED BY THE CIA AND HIPAA HOWEVER THESE TWO LAWS ONLY PROTECT SENSITIVE HEALTH INFORMATION IS GENERATED BY CERTAIN ENTITIES NOT THE INFORMATION CREATED BY MANY NEW HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES. THE CCPA WOULD APPLY TO THE STATE OF THE LAW IS NOT A STRONG FOR EXAMPLE THE FIFTY P. ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO STOP STILL THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IF YOU MAY HAVE- BY THE FALL PROHIBIT MOST CASES O SHARING AT ALL. AB TWELVE FIFTY TWO WOULD ADDRESS SERVICE GAPS IN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OVER CONSUMER SENSE OF HEALTH DATA AND WE URGE. YOU TO ADVANCE THE BILL THANK YOU AGAIN.

MANY OF OUR LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER ST SENSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR OPEN AND HONEST COMMUNICATION AND CLIENTS MIGHT BE CONFIDENT THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS PROTECTED. PROTECTING PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION IS NECESSARY AS THIS INFORMATION IS UNIQUE AND PRIVATE EACH INDIVIDUAL ALL THIS INFORMATION INCLUDES INTIMATE DETAILS OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WE MAY NOT I NOT WANT TO SHARE WITH OTHERS.

SO WE REQUEST YOUR INDULGENCE ON THAT- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THIS BILL. IS IN RED BAST. IT IS DIRECTING MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES HEALTH AGENCIES ALL OF THAT. THE AGENCIES IN MENTIONED. EXCLUDING THE ONES THAT WERE AMENDED OUT TODAY- BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF RECORDS OF NOT ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CRIMINAL USED FIREARMS BUT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO HAVE PURCHASED FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION AND PRECURSOR PARTS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THEM TO OF THIS RESEARCH CENTER- WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THE NOT EVEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE ARE ARE- PURCHASING FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION OR THOSE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS ARE ON THE APPS. PROGRAM OR OR ANY OTHER PERSON THERE TRANSFERRING THIS WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE. WE KNOW THE DATA BREACHES ARE POSSIBLE. THANK GOD AND THEY THEY HAVEN'T HAPPENED THERE SO FAR BUT IT HAPPENED AT STANFORD WE JUST HEARD THAT IT HAPPENED AT FACEBOOK THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS HAD NO DATA BREACHES OF WHICH I WAS- LITIGANT AGAINST. SO THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT IS GOING TO BE HANDED OVER TO THESE RESEARCHERS AND WE DON'T KNOW. WHO THEY ARE WHAT KIND OF BACKGROUND CHECKS OF LOOK AT IT THEY HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCES OR WHAT AND NOT ONLY TO THEM BUT TO THEIR ASSOCIATES. WE AT THE WAY WE READ THE BILL THIS CAN GO TO RAND CORPORATION OR GOOGLE OR ANYBODY ELSE IF THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE RESEARCH CENTER TO CRUNCH THE NUMBERS AND- YOU UTILIZED THE MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF RECORDS. AND FINALLY. IT IS AUSTIN'S GIVES DEPARTMENT JUSTICE THE OPPORTUNE TO GIVE IT TO OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WILL IMPACT THE LAND WHICH CLEARLY GIVES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHERRY PICK WHO IT IS THEY THEY ALLOWED TO UTILIZE THIS INFORMATION THOSE ARE SOME OF OUR CONCERNS AND I WOULD- EXPRESS OUR PART STRONG OPPOSITION FOLKS YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PRIVACY ISSUES ALL DAY LONG ALL COMMITTEE LONG.

AND THIS CROSSES A NUMBER OF AGENCIES OF MR FREDDIE HAS POINTED OUT. SOME OF THE TROUBLING BASEMENT THEN THE BILL INCLUDED YOU SEE SAYS IT'S NECESSARY RESEARCH BUT PROVIDES NO DEFINITION OF NECESSARY. AND THEY MAKE IT AN INTERNAL DECISION ABOUT THAT.

OF A- FOR NONPROFIT RESEARCH HAS PROVIDED SURE CAN DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT WILL THE CONSUMER BE AFFORDED AN OXY AND EVERY STEP OF THE WAY SO THEY KNOW WHERE THEIR INFORMATION IS GOING FROM INSTITUTION TO INSTITUTION. THE OVERSIGHT WILL BE BY THE RESEARCHERS OWN INTERNAL INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE HANDS IN A TWENTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND IN. THE UC RECENTLY REPORTED IN A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE THAT THEY WOULD PROTECT PRIVACY BY A SECURE PASSWORD SERVER WE ALL KNOW HAS BEEN STATED THAT DEAL JD UC'S HAVE BEEN HACKED.

MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THE TIME I THANK YOU MISS RAFI- LET'S LET'S BRING BACK TO CONVENE A VICE CHAIR KILEY GO AHEAD PLEASE I JUST WANT TO ASK ABOUT THIS CONCERN THAT'S BEEN RAISED THAT WERE- DESIGNATING YOU KNOW WHAT ONE PARTICULAR OFFICE OR RESEARCH INSTITUTE AS SORT OF THE PRIMARY RECIPIENT OF THIS- DATA AND THEN YOU KNOW SECONDARILY- OTHERS MIGHT GET IT- IF THERE ARE APPROVED BY AN OFFICE THAT'S HEADED BY SOMEONE WHO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS OFTEN TAKEN VERY. STRONG POSITIONS ON- POLITICAL ISSUES PERTAINING TO THE TOPIC OF THE RESEARCH SO I YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HOW DO YOU ANSWER THOSE CONCERNS THAT THIS PROCESS BY SPECIFICALLY NAMING ONE- INSTITUTE AND THEN HAVING A PERHAPS POLITICIZED PROCESS FOR THE SELECTION OF OTHERS MIGHT- SORT OF RUN AGAINST THE IDEA OF HAVING A SPIRIT OF INQUIRY- AND ASCERTAINMENT OF TRUTH AND MAY INSTEAD LEAD TO A PROCESS WHERE- YOU KNOW RECIPIENTS ARE SELECTED MORE BASED UPON THE- OUTCOMES THAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO REACH. I CAN M. REFER THAT TO MISTER WINTER I DO THINK I'M- ONE CORPORATIONS I THINK INSTITUTIONAL VIEWS ACTUALLY DON'T UC DAVIS I THINK YOU SAID. IT WAS DONE BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS THAT THE QUESTION WAS WHERE. IT'S THE TO DO THE DAVIS SISTERS REQUIRED- TO GET THE INFORMATION AND I BELIEVE- THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE WILL ALSO ACT- OTHER. RESEARCH INSTITUTES THAT- THAT MAY ALSO ASK FOR IT OKAY MISTER INTERNET YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT. SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO- FIRST OFF THAT DOES. THE SHALL LANGUAGE AS IT APPLIES TO THAT STATE FUNDED OF FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER- WAS PART OF THE CENTER'S INITIAL AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO WHICH IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS NOW BUT THE CURRENT BILL DOES- IS RESHAPED AND CLARIFY A MANDATE IN LIGHT OF SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS WITH DOJ- NOT ABIDING BY THE LANGUAGE AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED- WHAT DOJ HAS ALSO DONE IS ESSENTIALLY BLOCK ALL ACCESS TO THESE DATA- ON THE PART OF INSTITUTIONS OTHER BANDS. THAT STATE FUNDED- CENTER AND- YEAH I'M TO REACH NOT THE LEGISLATURE BUT I DO THAT THE INTENT HERE IS TO CREATE A PROCESS THAT MIGHT FUNCTION SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF THE PROCESS AT. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH WHERE FIRST TOP INSTITUTIONS NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THEIR STATE LAW HONEST AS BONAFIDE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS BUT THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME SORT OF FORMAL MERIT BASED PROCESS. FOR EVALUATING PROPOSALS FOR ACCESS TO DATA FROM RESEARCH AND I AND I SHOULD MENTION THE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. I WILL SAY CONVENIENTLY IGNORED THAT. ALL OF THE TIME IN THE PAST AND INTO THE FUTURE ALL OF THIS WORK OPERATES UNDER. A VERY TIGHT SECURITY BLANKET THAT INCORPORATES STATE LEVEL POLICIES UNIVERSITY LEVEL POLICIES FUNDING AGENCY POLICIES. YOU ARE PROJECT MAKING USE OF. THE STATE ARE ONLY PROVIDES ACCESS TO THOSE SPECIFIC TEAM MEMBERS WHO MUST HAVE ACCESS IN ORDER FOR THE TEAM TO DO ITS WORK. ACCESS IS KEPT AS RESTRICTED AS IS POSSIBLE TO ALLOW WHILE ALLOWING THE PROJECT TO CONTINUE. YOU SAID THAT THE DOJ BLOCKED ACCESS BEFORE COULD YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. EIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I CAN'T GIVE YOU A DEFINITE ANSWER BECAUSE DOJ. OVER TO NOW SEVERAL YEARS OF EFFORT HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE ONE- WHEN DATA BECAME HARDER TO GET- SENATOR HAND ACTUALLY INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT BECAME FOURTEEN TO THIRTY ONE POINT FIVE. OF THE PENAL CODE. PERTAINING SPECIFICALLY TO GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER DATA AND I CAN CLOSE OUT THAT INSTANCE IF YOU'D LIKE THAT ALL STATE GENERAL. FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET ANY STATEMENT FROM D. O. J. AS TO WHY THE DATA WERE NOT BEING PROVIDED THE CLOSEST I GOT WAS A MEETING WITH THE HEAD OF THE BUREAU OF RESEARCH AT DOJ. AND TWO MEMBERS OF- THE DOJ'S LEGAL STAFF WHO DID NOT GET THEIR LAST NAMES WHO SAID THAT THE DECISIONS WERE BEING MADE BY TO USE THEIR TURN EXACT UNQUOTE. THAT NO FURTHER INFORMATION IS FORTHCOMING NO THIS NO TIMELINE FOR RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE- WOULD BE PROVIDED. WE TRIED A GREAT MANY AVENUES TO RESOLVE THIS BLOCK INFORMALLY BEFORE. RESORTING TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. I WELL I JUST KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S IT'S THIS BILL GIVES DISCRETION TO DOJ STILL IN TERMS OF THE SELECTION OF RECIPIENTS OF WE'VE HAD. A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THEM BEFORE I'M WONDERING WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT. PLACE TO BE PLACING THAT DISCRETION THANK YOU. I'M SORRY HE HAD COMING TO ME. I DON'T THINK THAT WAS A QUESTION THANK YOU. YEAH THAT WAS A COMMON YOU VERY MUCH FOR ASKING- EITHER A- ADDITION. COMMENTS ALMOST IDENTICAL JUST VERY QUICKLY TO SAY THERE'S A GREAT RESIST TO RE. OF GUN RESEARCHING CENTER I THINK THAT DEPENDING ON TO. CONTROL THE ADMINISTRATION TO TURN WHETHER DOJ IS GOING BE- OF COOPER OR NOT AND THIS BILL MOVES THAT RESEARCH THAT'S SO DESPERATELY NEEDED- FORWARDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT SEEN NO OTHER COMMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU I COULDN'T AGREE MORE MISTER BENNETT I THINK THIS REACHES RESEARCH IS CRITICAL AND I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT ON MORE OF OUR LEGISLATION LOOKING AT. HOW EFFECTIVE ARE LEGISLATION IS AN IMPROVING AND SAVING THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS SO MOVING THIS WORD I THINK IS CRITICAL AND pBELIEVE WE PASSED THAT LEGISLATION OF CLASS.
