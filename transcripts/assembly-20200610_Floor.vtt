01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:57.846
DIFFERENT FROM LAST YEAR'S BILL

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:00.115

ONE IS IT INCREASES THE TIME OF

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:06.154

JURISDICTION. AND THEN THE

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:18.667
THIRD THING IT DOES IS ENSURE

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:21.036
THAT THE MANUFACTURED HOME

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:23.205

DURING ANY PARTICULAR EMERGENCY

02:07:30.075 --> 02:07:31.343
WHERE WE ARE UNABLE TO BE IN

02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:33.145

SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. IT WAS

02:07:42.421 --> 02:07:43.756
PRESENTED LAST WEEK IN THE

02:07:43.822 --> 02:07:45.124
ASSEMBLY RULES COMMITTEE THAT'S

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:46.825
WHERE THE MAN WAS TAKEN TO

02:07:46.892 --> 02:07:48.861
REMOVE ANY CONFLICT WHATSOEVER

02:07:48.927 --> 02:07:51.230
PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR. AND I

02:07:51.296 --> 02:07:53.532
THINK THERE WAS A CONFUSION BY

02:07:53.599 --> 02:07:57.503
SOME FOLKS. RAISING QUESTIONS

02:07:57.569 --> 02:07:59.304
THINKING THAT BY THIS ACTION WE

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:00.572
WOULD RE WRITE THE RULES

02:08:00.639 --> 02:08:02.474
WITHOUT PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT. SO

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:04.476
COURSE THIS IS A PROPOSED

02:08:04.543 --> 02:08:05.077
CONSTITUTION MEMBER WILL GO ON

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:07.112
THE BALLOT. AND THE PUBLIC WILL

02:08:07.179 --> 02:08:08.380
BE PERMITTED TO WAY AND

02:08:08.447 --> 02:08:10.349
ACTUALLY IT IS THEIR VIEW WHICH

02:08:10.416 --> 02:08:12.351
WILL BE DISPOSITIVE. OF THIS

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:13.218
POSSIBLE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:08:13.285 --> 02:08:15.721
AMENDMENT. I DO WANT TO NOTE

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:16.555
THAT I ACTUALLY THINK TWENTY

02:08:16.622 --> 02:08:19.091
TWENTY. IS EXCEPTIONAL TIME TO

02:08:19.158 --> 02:08:20.359
PUT A QUESTION LIKE THIS BEFORE

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:23.228
CALIFORNIANS. I THINK THERE ARE

02:08:23.295 --> 02:08:25.230
THREE VERY LARGE FACTORS OF THE

02:08:25.297 --> 02:08:27.166
WAY INTO THEIR CONSIDERATION.

02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:29.101
THAT TWENTY TWENTY ACQUAINT

02:08:29.168 --> 02:08:31.070
SOME WITH AN EXCEPTIONAL WAY WE

02:08:31.136 --> 02:08:32.571
ALL KNOW THE CHANGE IN

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:34.973
TECHNOLOGY. THAT EVERYONE IS

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:37.109
USING TO A GREATER EXTENT

02:08:37.176 --> 02:08:38.877
BECAUSE OF COVERT. SO HAVE

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:40.512
PERSONAL FAMILIARITY WITH HOW

02:08:40.579 --> 02:08:43.015
TECHNOLOGY EXTENDS YOUR REACH.

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:45.050
EVEN IN TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:08:45.117 --> 02:08:46.385
THEY HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF

02:08:46.452 --> 02:08:47.886
THOSE DISRUPTIONS ASSOCIATE

02:08:47.953 --> 02:08:51.023
COVE IN. NINETEEN WHICH WILL

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:53.225
GIVE THEM AN IMMEDIATE FRAME OF

02:08:53.292 --> 02:08:55.094
REFERENCE ON THIS QUESTION.

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:57.162
THAT TOO WILL BE A GREAT

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.763
ADVANTAGES A COMES BEFORE THE

02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:59.932
VOTERS. AND THEN THE THIRD

02:08:59.998 --> 02:09:02.301
ELEMENT HONESTLY IS THE ELEMENT

02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:04.036
OF PROTEST CURRENTLY COURSE

02:09:04.103 --> 02:09:06.071
INTO AMERICAN LIFE. CALIFORNIA

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:08.841
LIFE IT IS A REMINDER THAT

02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:09.374
PEOPLE DO WANT ACCOUNTABLE

02:15:53.278 --> 02:15:54.946
YEARS OF CALIFORNIA SUPREME

02:15:55.013 --> 02:15:57.382

CONSTITUTION NOT IS SAID I

02:16:05.891 --> 02:16:07.592
THINK IT'S EXTREMELY PER TAKE

02:16:07.659 --> 02:16:10.495
MEASURE TO CLARIFY WHAT THE

02:16:10.562 --> 02:16:12.330

IN CYBER. EYES IN SUPPORT OF

COMMENTS OF OUR CALL. FROM SAN.

02:16:20.672 --> 02:16:22.240
I THINK THAT THE TECHNOLOGY

02:16:22.307 --> 02:16:23.975
THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED RECENTLY.

02:16:24.042 --> 02:16:25.210
HAS REALLY EXPANDED

02:16:25.277 --> 02:16:25.977
TRANSPARENCY AND

02:16:26.044 --> 02:16:27.412
ACCOUNTABILITY. I THINK IT'S

02:16:27.479 --> 02:16:28.647
BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE INTO THE

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:29.948

SOMEWHAT TELLING WITH WITH AND

02:16:31.383 --> 02:16:33.084
I SAY THIS RESPECTFULLY. BUT

02:16:33.151 --> 02:16:34.653
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO

02:16:34.719 --> 02:16:36.321
THIS ARE THE PAID. PROFESSIONAL

02:16:36.388 --> 02:16:37.923
LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO.

02:16:37.989 --> 02:16:39.024
BECAUSE WHAT THEY ENJOY UNDER

02:16:39.090 --> 02:16:40.759
NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IS A NEAR

02:16:40.825 --> 02:16:42.827

02:16:54.706 --> 02:16:56.408
IMPORTANCE. BUT WHAT ALL OF US

02:16:56.474 --> 02:16:57.943
HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE

02:16:58.009 --> 02:16:58.910
WEEKS IS THAT BY USING

02:16:58.977 --> 02:17:00.712

PART OF THE PROCESS SO I THINK

02:17:06.017 --> 02:17:07.152
THAT THERE'S A REALLY STRONG

02:17:07.218 --> 02:17:08.386

CLEARLY. THIS IS SOMETHING

02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:11.756
THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE

02:17:11.823 --> 02:17:12.824

INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED BY THE

PUTTING AN OBSTACLE IN THE WAY

02:22:32.577 --> 02:22:33.945
OF THE PUBLIC BEING ABLE TO

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:35.813
REDRESS AND PETITION THEIR

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.248
GOVERNMENT. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:39.317
BEEN THERE AS IT DOES NOW AS IT

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:42.120
STILL DOES- PROVISIONS THAT

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:44.822
ALLOW FOR- SOME OTHER BODY TO

02:22:44.889 --> 02:22:48.960
FILL. SEATS US IF THERE WERE

02:22:49.027 --> 02:22:50.695
SOME SORT OF DESTRUCTIVE THING

02:22:50.762 --> 02:22:53.398
TO HAPPEN AND WE LOST MANY

02:22:53.464 --> 02:22:55.466
MEMBERS OF THIS CHAMBER. I

02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:57.068
DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY ELSE

02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:58.636
SHOULD FILL THAT SEAT OTHER

02:22:58.703 --> 02:23:01.172
THAN THE PEOPLE THAT THE DOT

02:23:01.239 --> 02:23:03.241
SEAT REPRESENTS. THE PEOPLE

02:23:03.308 --> 02:23:06.544
THAT WE REPRESENT. AND MAYBE

02:23:06.611 --> 02:23:08.279
MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT THIS BILL

02:23:08.346 --> 02:23:09.847
THERE'S THIS CONSTITUTIONAL

02:23:09.914 --> 02:23:11.783
AMENDMENT ALLOWS FOR PROXY

02:23:11.849 --> 02:23:14.118
VOTING AND I'M SORRY BUT EACH

02:23:14.185 --> 02:23:15.853
AND EVRY PERSON IN THIS ROOM

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.689
IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS ONE

02:23:17.755 --> 02:23:20.825
REASON YOU AND ONLY YOU. CAN

02:23:20.892 --> 02:23:23.895
REPRESENT. YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

02:23:23.962 --> 02:23:26.998
YOU AND ONLY YOU. HAVE BEEN

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:29.000
ENTRUSTED WITH THAT VOTE TO

02:23:29.067 --> 02:23:31.536
VOTE ON BEHALF OF THEM AND IF

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:33.938
WE ALLOW PROXY VOTING WEIRS WE

02:23:34.005 --> 02:23:35.073
ARE TAKING AWAY FROM THAT

02:23:35.139 --> 02:23:36.541
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE AND

02:23:36.607 --> 02:23:38.009
ALLOWING SOMEONE ELSE TO VOTE

02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:39.510
IN THAT SEE WHICH IS NOT WHAT

02:23:39.577 --> 02:23:42.380
OUR CONSTITUENTS INTENDED SO IF

02:23:42.447 --> 02:23:43.715
THE ISSUE IS ABOUT REMOTE

02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:44.615
VOTING THEN LET'S JUST MAKE THE

02:23:44.682 --> 02:23:46.584
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SIMPLY

02:23:46.651 --> 02:23:48.820
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I AGREE WE

02:23:48.886 --> 02:23:50.655
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET.

02:23:50.722 --> 02:23:52.023
DURING THIS EMERGENCY WE SHOULD

02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:53.391
HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO REMOTE

02:23:53.458 --> 02:23:54.926
IN WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:59.397
IT I AGREE WITH THE MEMBER FROM

02:23:59.464 --> 02:24:00.365
FROM THE GREAT SAN FERNANDO

02:24:00.431 --> 02:24:02.266
VALLEY- THAT ALREADY

02:24:02.333 --> 02:24:03.868
CONSTITUTIONALLY WE PROBABLY

02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:08.106
HAVE THAT ABILITY. TO DO THAT-

02:24:08.172 --> 02:24:09.207
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN

02:24:09.273 --> 02:24:12.410
LET'S JUST DO THAT. RIGHT BUT

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:14.445
ADDING IN THESE OTHER THINGS

02:24:14.512 --> 02:24:16.647
ALLOWING SEATS TO BE FILLED BY

02:24:16.714 --> 02:24:20.251
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT. THE PEOPLE.

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:20.818
WHO THAT SEAT IS SUPPOSED TO

02:24:20.885 --> 02:24:23.521
REPRESENT. AND STILL LEAVING IN

02:24:23.588 --> 02:24:24.789
THEIR PROXY VOTING WHICH ALLOW

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:26.858
SOMEONE ELSE TO VOTE ON BEHALF

02:24:26.924 --> 02:24:27.992
OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT THEY DID

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:29.761
NOT ELECT REPRESENT THAT'S A

02:24:29.827 --> 02:24:31.929
PROBLEM FOR ME AND IF WE CHANGE

02:24:31.996 --> 02:24:33.164
THAT IN THEIR HOUSE TO ME

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:34.198
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD

02:24:34.265 --> 02:24:36.200
DISCUSSION AMONGST MANY PEOPLE.

02:24:36.267 --> 02:24:37.235
BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD A FULL

02:24:37.301 --> 02:24:39.237
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HAVE THE

02:24:39.303 --> 02:24:41.839
PUBLIC WEIGH IN ON THIS AND

02:24:41.906 --> 02:24:43.641
HAVE DELIBERATION AND I THINK

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:44.242
YOU NEED TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY

02:24:44.308 --> 02:24:46.244
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING SIGNIFICANT.

02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:48.846
CHANGES SO. THAT IS WHY I CAN'T

02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:50.882
SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. AS IT

02:24:50.948 --> 02:24:52.583
SITS HERE TODAY AND I THINK WE

02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:53.484
SHOULD ALL BE THINKING ABOUT

02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:55.853
THOSE. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:57.855
AND I WILL AGREE WITH MY

02:24:57.922 --> 02:25:00.525
REPRESENTATIVE FROM ROCKLAND.

02:25:00.591 --> 02:25:02.693
MY COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKLAND THEY

02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:04.295
IT ONLY MATTERS OF THIS CHAMBER

02:25:04.362 --> 02:25:05.630
ACTUALLY STEPS UP AND

02:25:05.696 --> 02:25:07.198
CHALLENGES THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE

02:25:07.265 --> 02:25:10.034
TAKES OVER OUR LEGISLATIVE ROLE

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:12.403
AND HE HAS DONE THAT MANY TIMES

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:14.639
DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND WE'VE

02:25:14.705 --> 02:25:16.641
DONE VIRTUALLY NOTHING. WE

02:25:16.707 --> 02:25:18.076
DON'T LITTLE BIT COMPLAINED

02:25:18.142 --> 02:25:20.311
ABOUT IT. WE DONE VIRTUALLY

02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:21.746
NOTHING TO TAKE BACK

02:25:21.813 --> 02:25:23.214
LEGISLATIVE POWER THAT HE IS A

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:25.149
SERB FROM US WITH EXECUTIVE

02:25:25.216 --> 02:25:26.984
ORDERS. WHETHER YOU'RE DOING IT

02:25:27.051 --> 02:25:28.653
REMOTELY. OR WHETHER YOU'RE

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:30.688
DOING IN THIS CHAMBER AT SOME

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:32.256
POINT THIS BODIES GOT A STEP UP

02:25:32.323 --> 02:25:34.192
AND SAY THIS IS THE LEGISLATIVE

HOUSE THE LEGISLATIVE POWERS

02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:37.929
ARE OURS ALONE. AND NOT THE

02:25:37.995 --> 02:25:39.464
GOVERNOR'S AND UNLESS SOMEONE

02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:40.164
IS WILLING TO DO THAT IT

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:41.365
DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE-

02:25:41.432 --> 02:25:44.202

THE WILL OF US TO PROTECT THAT

SO DON'T. PUT THIS IS THIS IS

02:25:47.238 --> 02:25:48.706
THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN.

RISE AS JOIN AUTHOR OF A CA

02:26:09.894 --> 02:26:10.795
TWENTY FIVE WHICH WOULD ENSURE

02:26:10.862 --> 02:26:12.830
CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT DURING

02:26:12.897 --> 02:26:15.366
TIMES OF DISASTER. AS THE COLD

02:26:15.433 --> 02:26:17.802
WITH NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE

02:26:17.869 --> 02:26:19.804
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR OUR

02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:22.306
LEGISLATIVE WORK DOES NOT STOP

02:26:22.373 --> 02:26:24.342
SIMPLY BECAUSE CIRCUMSTANCES

02:26:24.408 --> 02:26:25.610
PREVENT US FROM BEING

02:26:25.676 --> 02:26:26.644
PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE

02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:29.013
CAPITAL IN FACT IN TIMES OF

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:31.649
DISASTER OUR CONSTITUENTS NEED

02:26:31.716 --> 02:26:33.651
REPRESENTATION MORE THAN EVER

02:26:33.718 --> 02:26:35.686

CONTROL OUR STATE OVER TO THE

02:26:37.555 --> 02:26:39.390
GOVERNOR IS NOT THE ONLY

02:26:39.457 --> 02:26:40.758
SOLUTION THAT WE CAN HAVE

02:26:40.825 --> 02:26:42.527
AVAILABLE TO US. AND IT'S

02:26:42.593 --> 02:26:45.963
GLARING FAILURE THAT IS A STATE

02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:46.998
THAT LEADS THE WORLD IN

02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:49.634
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION WE IN

02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:51.202
STATE GOVERNMENT HAVE FALLEN SO

02:26:51.269 --> 02:26:55.406
WOEFULLY BEHIND THE TIMES ACA

02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:56.440
TWENTY FIVE WOULD HELP BRING US

02:26:56.507 --> 02:26:58.476
INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

02:26:58.543 --> 02:26:59.677
WHAT THE WORK CONTINUES

02:26:59.744 --> 02:27:02.513
REGARDLESS OF OUTSIDE

02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:05.550
CIRCUMSTANCES. I WANT TO MAKE

02:27:05.616 --> 02:27:06.717
IT CLEARER THE INTENT OF THE

02:27:06.784 --> 02:27:08.152

LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THIS IS A

02:27:14.525 --> 02:27:17.895
CA DOES NOT PREVENT. OR PLACE

02:27:17.962 --> 02:27:19.263
ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE PUBLIC

02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:21.632

IN ANY WAY. NOTHING IN THIS ACA

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:30.341
PREVENTS ANY MEMBER OF THE

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:32.677
PUBLIC FROM CONTACTING THEIR

02:27:32.743 --> 02:27:35.213
LEGISLATORS OR FOR FROM

THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING IN

02:27:40.218 --> 02:27:41.919
FACT IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER.

02:27:41.986 --> 02:27:44.355
NOTHING IN THIS A CA ALLOWS

02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:45.957
LEGISLATORS TO VOTE OR

AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THEIR

02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:58.502
CONCERNS. FURTHER THE ABILITY

02:27:58.569 --> 02:28:00.171
TO VOTE REMOTELY IS GRANTED

02:28:00.238 --> 02:28:01.906
ONLY TO THOSE LEGISLATORS WHO

CANNOT SAFELY GET TO THE

EMERGENCY A DROUGHT FOR EXAMPLE

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:09.981
IS NOT BECAUSE TO ALLOW REMOTE

02:28:10.047 --> 02:28:13.117
VOTING UNDER A CA TWENTY FIVE.

02:28:13.184 --> 02:28:15.853
FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.

02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:17.188
THIS MEASURE WILL GO TO THE

OF THIS MEASURE MAY BE INVOKED.

02:28:32.336 --> 02:28:34.372
TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS NEVER

02:28:34.438 --> 02:28:34.972
LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO

SPEAKER MEMBERS. YOU KNOW I

02:28:51.856 --> 02:28:56.027
THINK WE ALL HAVE MANY CONCERNS.

02:28:56.093 --> 02:28:58.162
OVER THIS CONSTITUTIONAL

02:28:58.229 --> 02:29:02.233
AMENDMENT. AND I KNOW THE

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:04.402
AUTHOR OF THIS HAS BEEN WORKING

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:07.571
DILIGENTLY. I THINK WE CAN ALL

02:29:07.638 --> 02:29:11.375
AGREE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WITH

02:29:11.442 --> 02:29:13.177
THE GOVERNOR ROLLING VIA

02:29:13.244 --> 02:29:15.479
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND US FINDING

02:29:15.546 --> 02:29:19.083
OUT WHAT HE'S DOING. ON THE

02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:22.320
NEWS OR HIS FACEBOOK OR HOWEVER

02:29:22.386 --> 02:29:24.255
YOU ALL COTTAGE. IS NOT

02:29:24.322 --> 02:29:29.393
ACCEPTABLE. I FEEL THAT THERE

02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:30.928
ARE STILL SOME PROVISIONS IN

02:29:30.995 --> 02:29:35.533
THIS. THAT NEED WORK. I FEEL

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:38.169
THAT THE PROXY SITUATION IS AN

02:29:38.235 --> 02:29:43.307
ISSUE. AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT

02:29:43.374 --> 02:29:44.275
AS THIS MOVES THROUGH THE

02:29:44.342 --> 02:29:47.345
SENATE THE AUTHOR WILL ADDRESS

02:29:47.411 --> 02:29:49.313
THESE THINGS AND TAKE SOME MORE

02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:52.550
AMENDMENTS. TO CLEAN THIS UP TO

02:29:52.616 --> 02:29:54.852
REALLY TRULY INSURER. THAT THE

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:57.621
VOTERS ARE GETTING THE VOICE

02:29:57.688 --> 02:30:00.024
THAT THEY VOTED FOR. AND THAT

02:30:00.091 --> 02:30:03.227
THAT POWER REMAINS WITH THEM. I

02:30:03.294 --> 02:30:04.729
WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF THE

02:30:04.795 --> 02:30:05.830
AUTHOR OF THE BILL WOULD

02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:08.165
ADDRESS THOSE- POSSIBLE

02:30:08.232 --> 02:30:10.401
AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE AND

02:30:10.468 --> 02:30:13.137
HIS CLOSE. I THINK THAT-

02:30:13.204 --> 02:30:15.272
REMOVING THE PROXIES WOULD MAKE

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:17.942
THIS MUCH MORE PALATABLE- X.

THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE

06:00:53.531 --> 06:00:54.299

DISCRIMINATION AND DISPARITIES

06:00:57.602 --> 06:00:59.938
STEMMING FROM INSTITUTIONAL AND

06:01:00.005 --> 06:01:02.173
SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES.

06:01:05.343 --> 06:01:08.346
VIRUS PANDEMIC WITH BOTH THE

SIMULTANEOUSLY NAVIGATE HIGHER

06:01:19.457 --> 06:01:21.760
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. IT IS CLEAR

06:01:21.826 --> 06:01:23.561
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE AN EQUAL

06:01:23.628 --> 06:01:26.231
PLAYING FIELD. BY ALLOWING

06:01:26.297 --> 06:01:28.533
CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO REMOVE THE

06:01:28.600 --> 06:01:30.402
BAN ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND

06:01:30.468 --> 06:01:32.771

PUBLIC EDUCATION. IF WE DO THAT

06:01:41.112 --> 06:01:44.649
WE WORK TOWARDS EQUITY. EQUITY

06:01:44.716 --> 06:01:46.317

EACH PERSON THE APPROPRIATERESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES

06:01:52.791 --> 06:01:55.493
THEY NEED TO SUCCEED. EQUITY IS

06:01:55.560 --> 06:01:57.896
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD SO

06:01:57.962 --> 06:01:59.864
THAT NO ONE GROUP HAS A HIGHER

06:01:59.931 --> 06:02:02.467
RATE OF POVERTY. AND OTHER

06:02:02.534 --> 06:02:05.336
NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. UNTIL WE

WE HAD IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

06:22:24.221 --> 06:22:26.156
FUNDAMENTALLY THE CHALLENGE

06:22:26.223 --> 06:22:28.025
BEING FACED IS THE STRUCTURE OF

06:22:28.091 --> 06:22:30.093
THIS NATION FROM ITS LAWS TO

06:22:30.160 --> 06:22:31.728
ITS OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BEEN

06:22:31.795 --> 06:22:32.729
RIGGED AGAINST COMMUNITIES OF

IS NOT ONLY POLICING. THAT'S

06:22:41.305 --> 06:22:44.408
JUST THE START. IF THE SYSTEMIC

06:22:44.474 --> 06:22:46.143

06:22:56.486 --> 06:22:59.790

06:22:59.856 --> 06:23:01.491

06:29:35.785 --> 06:29:37.387
EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT. IN

HISTORY RIGHT NOW. AN

06:29:38.888 --> 06:29:40.123
UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT WE HAVE

06:29:40.190 --> 06:29:42.125
WITNESSED PROTESTS. ACROSS THIS

06:29:42.192 --> 06:29:44.194
COUNTRY. OFTEN IN PLACES WHERE

06:29:44.260 --> 06:29:45.895
WE WOULD NOT EXPECT THEM. WHERE

06:29:45.962 --> 06:29:47.130
PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY YOUNG

06:29:47.197 --> 06:29:49.532
PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING. NOT JUST

06:29:49.599 --> 06:29:51.201
JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD. THE

MY- COLLEAGUE AND I FROM HOW

06:29:56.039 --> 06:29:57.307
ALSO WERE TALKING LAST NIGHT

06:29:57.373 --> 06:29:59.042
ABOUT THE FACT. THAT ANYONE WHO

06:29:59.109 --> 06:30:00.443
IS UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY ONE

06:30:00.510 --> 06:30:01.911
HAS NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

06:30:01.978 --> 06:30:03.613
WEIGH IN ON THIS ISSUE. THAT

06:30:03.680 --> 06:30:04.981
THEY ARE THAT OUR GENERATION

06:30:05.048 --> 06:30:07.517
HAS NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO

06:30:07.584 --> 06:30:08.718
SPEAK TO THIS AND TO HAVE A

06:30:08.785 --> 06:30:09.686
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT IT'S

06:30:09.753 --> 06:30:12.055
BEEN. A QUARTER OF A CENTURY

06:30:12.122 --> 06:30:12.789
SINCE VOTERS WERE GIVEN THE

06:30:12.856 --> 06:30:15.391
OPPORTUNITY. I RESPECTFULLY

06:30:15.458 --> 06:30:16.326
SUGGEST THAT OUR GENERATION.

06:30:16.392 --> 06:30:18.361
I'M THIRTY EIGHT A COLLEAGUE I

06:30:18.428 --> 06:30:20.096
THINK IS A IS APPROACHING FORTY

06:30:20.163 --> 06:30:21.831
WERE NOT THAT YOUNG- OUR-

06:30:21.898 --> 06:30:26.436
GENERATION. HAS A DIFFERENT

06:30:26.503 --> 06:30:27.003
PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS. AND I

06:30:27.070 --> 06:30:27.937
THINK. THAT WE HAVE THE

06:30:28.004 --> 06:30:28.571
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS

06:30:28.638 --> 06:30:32.542
ISSUE. THAT LEFT OUR YOUNG

06:30:32.609 --> 06:30:33.009
PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

06:30:33.076 --> 06:30:34.444
CALIFORNIA AND ALL PEOPLE IN

06:30:34.511 --> 06:30:36.346
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE

06:30:36.412 --> 06:30:38.848
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS

06:30:38.915 --> 06:30:39.449
CONVERSATION. I THINK AT THIS

06:30:39.516 --> 06:30:40.784
MOMENT IN TIME. I THINK DEMAND.

06:30:40.850 --> 06:30:42.285
FOR CHIU THIS. THE DEMAND FOR

06:30:42.352 --> 06:30:43.386
OFFICE. CHANGE THAT WE ARE

06:30:43.453 --> 06:30:44.120
WITNESSING FOR PEOPLE A- THIS

06:30:44.187 --> 06:30:45.555
COUNTRY. BE EXTRAORDINARILY

06:30:45.622 --> 06:30:47.223
SHORT SIGHTED ABBAS AND I THINK

06:30:47.290 --> 06:30:49.025
I WOULD SUGGEST. REALLY TONE

06:30:49.092 --> 06:30:50.827
DEAF. FOR US NOT TO PERMIT

06:30:50.894 --> 06:30:54.164
VOTERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

06:30:54.230 --> 06:30:54.764
WEIGH ON ON THIS. AT THE SAME

06:30:54.831 --> 06:30:55.598
TIME OUT ALSO. THAT THIS IS A

06:30:55.665 --> 06:30:57.233
CHEN. AND COMPLEX ISSUE FOR A

06:30:57.300 --> 06:30:58.735
LOT OF PEOPLE. BECAUSE IT

06:30:58.802 --> 06:31:01.371
REQUIRES US TO BE HONEST ABOUT

06:31:01.437 --> 06:31:01.971
SOME PARTS OF OUR HISTORY THAT

06:31:02.038 --> 06:31:02.906
ARE HARD TO THINK ABOUT.

06:31:02.972 --> 06:31:04.440
REQUIRES US TO BE HONEST ABOUT

06:31:04.507 --> 06:31:06.009
HOW BADLY THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED

06:31:06.075 --> 06:31:08.511
IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M A WHEN I

06:31:08.578 --> 06:31:09.312
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS

06:31:09.379 --> 06:31:11.848
ABOUT THESE ISSUES OFTENTIMES

06:31:11.915 --> 06:31:12.382
PEOPLE SAY WELL WHAT ABOUT

06:31:12.448 --> 06:31:13.683
ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

06:31:13.750 --> 06:31:15.084
WHY CAN'T WE JUST FOCUS ON ON

06:31:15.151 --> 06:31:16.386
POVERTY IN THERE THERE'S MERIT

06:31:16.452 --> 06:31:17.453
TO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

06:31:17.520 --> 06:31:19.489
POVERTY IS A REAL ISSUE. BUT WE

06:31:19.556 --> 06:31:20.990
ALSO KNOW THAT RACE AND GENDER

06:31:21.057 --> 06:31:22.959
MATTER. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE

06:31:23.026 --> 06:31:24.160
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS

06:31:24.227 --> 06:31:26.095
DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE ARE

06:31:26.162 --> 06:31:27.764
DIFFERENT OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE

06:31:27.831 --> 06:31:29.065
BASED ON RACE AND GENDER IN

06:31:29.132 --> 06:31:31.067
EDUCATION AND HEALTH AND JOB

06:31:31.134 --> 06:31:32.836
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WAY THAT

06:31:32.902 --> 06:31:34.804
THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES. IN AND

06:31:34.871 --> 06:31:36.406
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

06:31:36.472 --> 06:31:38.174
TO BE HONEST ABOUT. IT ALSO

06:31:38.241 --> 06:31:40.009
IGNORES HIS. IGNORES THE FACT

06:31:40.076 --> 06:31:41.477
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CENTURIES

06:31:41.544 --> 06:31:43.413
OF SAYS OF SYSTEMIC RACIAL

06:31:43.479 --> 06:31:44.547
INJUSTICE THAT HAVE BEEN

06:31:44.614 --> 06:31:46.649
EMBEDDED IN SO MANY PARTS OF

06:31:46.716 --> 06:31:47.183
OUR PUBLIC POLICY IN THIS

06:31:47.250 --> 06:31:50.053
COUNTRY. IN EDUCATION IN ZONING

06:31:50.119 --> 06:31:52.288
AND HOUSING AND IT'S SO MANY

06:31:52.355 --> 06:31:53.122
DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO MANY

06:31:53.189 --> 06:31:55.491
DIFFERENT. FACETS OF OUR PUBLIC

06:31:55.558 --> 06:31:57.360
POLICY WE HAVE SEEN THINGS THAT

06:31:57.427 --> 06:31:58.194
HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY

06:31:58.261 --> 06:31:59.829
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF

06:31:59.896 --> 06:32:02.265
COLOR AND WOMEN. AND THE OTHER

06:32:02.332 --> 06:32:03.333
THING THAT I WOULD SUGGEST ALL

06:32:03.399 --> 06:32:04.367
OF US WHEN YOU'RE THINKING

06:32:04.434 --> 06:32:05.835
ABOUT THIS IS THAT I THINK ALL

06:32:05.902 --> 06:32:07.804
OF US KNOW IN OUR HEARTS. THE

06:32:07.871 --> 06:32:09.739
RACE AND GENDER MATTER. I DON'T

06:32:09.806 --> 06:32:10.673
THINK THAT THERE'S A PERSON IN

06:32:10.740 --> 06:32:12.742
HERE WHO WOULD WOULD DISPUTE

06:32:12.809 --> 06:32:13.943
THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY

06:32:14.010 --> 06:32:14.944
THESE ARE THINGS THAT THAT

06:32:15.011 --> 06:32:16.679
IMPACT US AND THAT THE IMPACT

06:32:16.746 --> 06:32:17.914
ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS

06:32:17.981 --> 06:32:19.449
VERY DAY. AND SO FOR THOSE

06:32:19.515 --> 06:32:20.950
REASONS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

06:32:21.017 --> 06:32:23.419
SUGGEST TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT

06:32:23.486 --> 06:32:23.920
THIS IS A REALLY REALLY

06:32:23.987 --> 06:32:25.021
IMPORTANT VOTE. AND TO THOSE

06:32:25.088 --> 06:32:26.990
WHO MIGHT THINK THAT. IS THAT.

06:32:27.056 --> 06:32:28.725
THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. IS

06:32:28.791 --> 06:32:30.693
SOMETHING THAT ZERO SUM MIGHT

06:32:30.760 --> 06:32:31.527
OFFER. I OFTEN ALTERNATE

06:32:31.594 --> 06:32:32.962
PERSPECTIVE. BUT THIS IS

06:32:33.029 --> 06:32:39.402
ACTUALLY. WHEN I THINK A LOT

06:32:39.469 --> 06:32:40.970
ABOUT THE- THE SEMINAL SUPREME

06:32:41.037 --> 06:32:42.805
COURT CASES FROM THE EARLY TWO

06:32:42.872 --> 06:32:45.141
THOUSANDS ABOUT ABOUT

06:32:45.208 --> 06:32:45.808
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN PUBLIC

06:32:45.875 --> 06:32:47.443
HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE FACT

06:32:47.510 --> 06:32:48.945
THAT SOME OF THE STRONGEST AND

06:32:49.012 --> 06:32:50.513
MOST PERSUASIVE ARGUMENTS THAT

06:32:50.580 --> 06:32:51.614
WERE ULTIMATELY CITED IN

06:32:51.681 --> 06:32:53.883
JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S OPINION CAME

06:32:53.950 --> 06:32:55.485
FROM THE MILITARY. THE SECOND

06:32:55.551 --> 06:32:57.387
IS COMMUNITY THAT IS WAITING IN

06:32:57.453 --> 06:32:58.755
SUPPORT OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

06:32:58.821 --> 06:32:59.722
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT'S A

06:32:59.789 --> 06:33:01.591
IT'S A CENTRAL TO OUR

06:33:01.658 --> 06:33:02.959
COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR

06:33:03.026 --> 06:33:03.860
BUSINESSES TO THE STRENGTH OF

06:33:03.927 --> 06:33:05.495
OUR MILITARY AND SO I WOULD

06:33:05.561 --> 06:33:06.596
SUGGEST EVERYBODY THAT

06:33:06.663 --> 06:33:08.031
EVERYBODY WILL BENEFIT FROM

06:33:08.097 --> 06:33:09.866
THIS WE WILL HAVE A SOCIETY

06:33:09.933 --> 06:33:11.267
THAT STREET THAT FREE- THAT'S

06:33:11.334 --> 06:33:13.603
HEALTHIER AND STRONGER.

06:33:13.670 --> 06:33:14.537
WEALTHIER THAT'S MORE COHESIVE

06:33:14.604 --> 06:33:16.639
THE MORE EQUITABLE AND MARCH

06:33:16.706 --> 06:33:18.641
STE LOSS OF A SOCIETY THAT'S

06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:20.343
BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE HONEST ABOUT

06:33:20.410 --> 06:33:21.978
HOW BADLY THIS SYSTEM IS RIGGED

06:33:22.045 --> 06:33:23.446
AND BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO

06:33:23.513 --> 06:33:24.580
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND I

06:33:24.647 --> 06:33:26.449
THINK THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL GIFT

06:33:26.516 --> 06:33:27.750
FOR US IF TO OUR CHILDREN AND

06:33:27.817 --> 06:33:30.286

A FIFTH GRADE CLASS FOR MY

06:33:43.933 --> 06:33:45.768
DISTRICT CAME TO THE CAPITOL TO

06:33:45.835 --> 06:33:47.937
ADVOCATE FOR EQUITY NOT JUST

06:33:48.004 --> 06:33:50.006
EQUALITY. AND THE PRESUMPTION

06:33:50.073 --> 06:33:51.674
BE TO BEHIND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

06:33:51.741 --> 06:33:52.709
IS TO CREATE AN OPTION FOR

06:33:52.775 --> 06:33:55.478
THOSE LEADERS WHO WANT TO FIGHT

06:33:55.545 --> 06:33:56.579
THE HISTORIC GENDER AND RACIAL

06:33:56.646 --> 06:33:58.781
BIAS. AND CREATE A LEVEL

IS ONE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION

06:34:03.219 --> 06:34:04.220
IT GIVES THE VOTERS OF

06:34:04.287 --> 06:34:05.688
CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO

06:34:05.755 --> 06:34:06.923
HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD.

06:34:06.990 --> 06:34:08.725
ESPECIALLY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

COULDN'T VOTE TWO DECADES AGO.

06:34:10.426 --> 06:34:12.729
WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

06:34:12.795 --> 06:34:13.262
GIVEN THE CURRENT NATIONAL

06:34:13.329 --> 06:34:15.798
DISCOURSE. I THINK OF THOSE

06:34:15.865 --> 06:34:17.166

WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. AB TWO OH

NINE WAS ABOUT PRESERVING

06:34:50.633 --> 06:34:52.568
PRIVILEGE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

06:34:52.635 --> 06:34:54.437
TALKING ABOUT TODAY FOR SOMEONE

06:34:54.504 --> 06:34:57.473
TO SAY I AM COLOR BLIND WHAT

06:34:57.540 --> 06:34:59.409
THEY'RE BLIND TO IS THEIR OWN

06:34:59.475 --> 06:35:02.211
PRIVILEGE. WHAT THEIR BLINDS TO

06:35:02.278 --> 06:35:03.746
IS THE BENEFIT AND THE

06:35:03.813 --> 06:35:05.415
RESILIENCE IN THE BEAUTY OF

CULTURES THEY'RE NOT

06:35:07.784 --> 06:35:10.787
NECESSARILY FAMILIAR WITH.

06:35:10.853 --> 06:35:11.421

ANYTHING ELSE. IS THAT LIVE. IT

06:35:24.467 --> 06:35:27.537
IS TIME WE AND THAT WHY IT IS

06:35:27.603 --> 06:35:29.639
TIME WE STAND UP TO THOSE WHO

06:35:29.705 --> 06:35:32.008
HAVE HAD PRIVILEGE. AND USE

06:35:32.075 --> 06:35:33.810
THAT PRIVILEGE TO KEEP OTHER

06:35:33.876 --> 06:35:36.612

COMPLETELY REPEAL PROP TWO OH

06:35:43.386 --> 06:35:46.022
NINE. IF WE CAN'T COMPLETELY

06:35:46.089 --> 06:35:48.424
REPEAL THE LAWS THAT HAVE BUILT

06:35:48.491 --> 06:35:51.294
SYSTEMIC RACISM AND SEXISM INTO

06:35:51.360 --> 06:35:53.229
MOST EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WITH

06:35:53.296 --> 06:35:56.199
OUR INSTITUTIONS. THEN WE HAVE

06:35:56.265 --> 06:35:58.568
A LOT MORE WORK TO DO THAT JUST

06:35:58.634 --> 06:36:00.803
A CA FIVE THIS IS A STEP WE CAN

06:36:00.870 --> 06:36:03.172
TAKE THIS IS FOREVER ALL OF US

06:36:03.239 --> 06:36:04.640

COME TO MIND. ABRAHAM LINCOLN

06:41:50.619 --> 06:41:51.187

06:41:55.291 --> 06:41:59.395
ENTER INTO A DIFFERENT QUALITY.

06:41:59.462 --> 06:41:59.929
OF ITS UNDERSTAND OF WHAT

06:41:59.995 --> 06:42:03.132
FREEDOM MEANT. THAT WAS WHAT HE

06:42:03.199 --> 06:42:07.470
SAW BEFORE US. HE SAW THIS AS

06:42:07.536 --> 06:42:09.371
SOMETHING THAT WAS AN EXTENSION

06:42:09.438 --> 06:42:12.274
OF THE WORK AND THE- SACRIFICE

06:42:12.341 --> 06:42:15.644
IT PRECEDED IT. HE SAW IT AS

06:42:15.711 --> 06:42:18.514
SOMETHING THAT WAS FOUNDED IN

06:42:18.581 --> 06:42:21.350
THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA. I HAVE

06:42:21.417 --> 06:42:23.385
THE UTMOST REGARD FOR THIS

06:42:23.452 --> 06:42:25.688
CAPITAL IN THIS CHAMBER. BUT

06:42:25.754 --> 06:42:27.122
THE MEANING OF AMERICA WILL NOT

06:42:27.189 --> 06:42:29.258
BE SETTLED HERE. IT WILL BE

06:42:29.325 --> 06:42:30.726
SETTLED IN THE HEARTS OF

AMERICANS IT'LL BE SETTLED IN

06:42:33.462 --> 06:42:36.465
THE HEARTS OF CALIFORNIANS. I

06:42:36.532 --> 06:42:40.269
THINK ACA FIVE. COMING AS IT

06:42:40.336 --> 06:42:42.838
DOES IN THIS YEAR. WHEN WE HAVE

06:42:42.905 --> 06:42:46.675
SEEN SO MUCH DIVISION. REALLY

06:42:46.742 --> 06:42:49.945
PRESENTS A PLEBISCITE. AN

06:42:50.012 --> 06:42:51.213
OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEFORE

06:42:51.280 --> 06:42:54.016
CALIFORNIANS AND SAY WHAT IS

06:42:54.083 --> 06:42:55.885
THE NATURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY

06:42:55.951 --> 06:42:58.220
WHAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY

06:42:58.287 --> 06:43:02.424
ONE INDIVIDUAL. CAN CELEBRATE

06:43:02.491 --> 06:43:04.460
AND HARBOR HOPE FOR ANOTHER WHO

06:43:04.527 --> 06:43:07.229
MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM NOW. YOU

06:43:07.296 --> 06:43:09.632
KNOW THERE CANNOT BE DEMOCRACY

06:43:09.698 --> 06:43:12.735
IF THERE IS NOT COMPASSION. IF

06:43:12.801 --> 06:43:15.137
THERE IS NOT EMPATHY. FOR

06:43:15.204 --> 06:43:16.805
PEOPLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES

06:43:16.872 --> 06:43:19.308
THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN. I

06:43:19.375 --> 06:43:22.511
THINK THAT THE WHOLE MILIEU OF

06:43:22.578 --> 06:43:26.849
SOCIAL MEDIA. ACTUALLY HAS THE

06:43:26.916 --> 06:43:28.117
BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF

06:43:28.183 --> 06:43:29.652
CONFRONTING EVERYONE WITH A

06:43:29.718 --> 06:43:32.922
DIFFERENT LIVES UPON REAL LIFE.

06:43:32.988 --> 06:43:34.390
SO I THINK THIS IS A

06:43:34.456 --> 06:43:37.927
OUTSTANDING TIME TWENTY TWENTY.

06:43:37.993 --> 06:43:40.162

CONFERRED UPON SOMEBODY WHO IS

FACE BURDENS. YOU KNOW IT WAS

06:43:57.479 --> 06:44:00.983
JOHN DUNN WHO LIVED IN THE

06:44:01.050 --> 06:44:01.584
FIFTEEN HUNDREDS SERVED IN THE

06:44:01.650 --> 06:44:05.454
PARLIAMENT. WHO SAID NO MAN IS

06:44:05.521 --> 06:44:08.257
AN ISLAND COMPUTER TO ITSELF.

06:44:08.324 --> 06:44:09.959
IF A CLOD FALLS AWAY EUROPE IS

06:44:10.025 --> 06:44:12.561

IMPACT ON GENERATIONS TO COME

06:46:38.474 --> 06:46:41.210
IT'S A LITTLE TO NOT TODAY WE

06:46:41.276 --> 06:46:41.643
DENY GENERATION THAT

06:46:41.710 --> 06:46:46.682
OPPORTUNITY. WHEN YOU THINK

06:46:46.749 --> 06:46:49.818
ABOUT OPPORTUNITY. YEAH YOU

06:46:49.885 --> 06:46:52.254
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. HOW KIDS

06:46:52.321 --> 06:46:56.225
ARE RAISED. AND I'LL BE GOOD

06:46:56.291 --> 06:46:58.160
BREAK INTO A VERY VERY SIMPLE.

06:46:58.227 --> 06:46:59.862
SIMPLE STORY WHICH IS MY STORE

06:46:59.928 --> 06:47:02.097
AND IT'S NOT UNIQUE. MOST OF US

06:47:02.164 --> 06:47:06.034
HERE WHO ARE OF COLOR OR WOMEN.

06:47:06.101 --> 06:47:06.468
HAVE BENEFITTED FROM

06:47:06.535 --> 06:47:09.271
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MANY MANY OF

06:47:09.338 --> 06:47:11.874
YOU SHARE SIMILAR STORIES. IF

06:47:11.940 --> 06:47:13.909
YOUR PARENTS CAN'T CAME HERE

06:47:13.976 --> 06:47:14.476
FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTRY AND

06:47:14.543 --> 06:47:16.612
THEY WORK EXTREMELY HARD.

06:47:16.678 --> 06:47:17.179
WASN'T MY CHOICE TO BE BORN

06:47:17.246 --> 06:47:21.049
POOR. IT WASN'T MY CHOICE THE

06:47:21.116 --> 06:47:21.617
BE BORN AND NOT UNDERSTAND A

06:47:21.683 --> 06:47:24.887
LANGUAGE. WASN'T MY CHOICE TO

06:47:24.953 --> 06:47:27.256
LIVE IN SECTION EIGHT HOUSING.

06:47:27.322 --> 06:47:28.490
WASN'T MY CHOICE TO WORK FULL

06:47:28.557 --> 06:47:32.094
TIME- WHILE I WAS IN COLLEGE.

06:47:32.161 --> 06:47:33.395
THE DID I GET THE BEST GRADES

06:47:33.462 --> 06:47:35.397
IN THAT I GET A FOUR POINT

06:47:35.464 --> 06:47:37.166
THREE AND DIE SLAM DUNK IT IN

06:47:37.232 --> 06:47:39.234
THE IN THE UCLA RIGHT AFTER

06:47:39.301 --> 06:47:42.371
HIGH SCHOOL. COURSE NOT. THEY

06:47:42.437 --> 06:47:44.306
TAKE ME A LONG TIME. LIKE IT

06:47:44.373 --> 06:47:45.674
TOOK OTHERS TO GET THE

06:47:45.741 --> 06:47:48.076
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF COURSE.

06:47:48.143 --> 06:47:50.712
PROBABLY LONGER THAN IT SHOULD.

06:47:50.779 --> 06:47:53.715
FIVE SIX YEARS ON LIKE THAT.

06:47:53.782 --> 06:47:56.652
BUT THIS IS THE REALITY. WHEN

06:47:56.718 --> 06:47:58.587
YOU HAVE TO WORK AND YOU HAVE

06:47:58.654 --> 06:48:00.656
TO HELP YOUR PARENTS MAKE RENT

06:48:00.722 --> 06:48:03.358
NO ONE CHOOSES THAT. SO THIS

06:48:03.425 --> 06:48:06.328
WHOLE IDEA. AND I'M NOT SAYING

06:48:06.395 --> 06:48:08.730
ANYONE IS THAT IT. BUT THIS

06:48:08.797 --> 06:48:11.099
WHOLE IDEA AT THE TIME. THAT

06:48:11.166 --> 06:48:13.402
CERTAIN KIDS ONE QUALIFIED THAT

06:48:13.468 --> 06:48:15.871
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE EQUAL AND

06:48:15.938 --> 06:48:16.471
THAT RE SHOULDN'T MATTER WILL

06:48:16.538 --> 06:48:18.907
IT DOES. BECAUSE THE ZIP CODE

06:48:18.974 --> 06:48:20.943
THAT YOU WERE BORN IN

06:48:21.009 --> 06:48:21.543
DETERMINES WHERE YOU'RE GOING

06:48:21.610 --> 06:48:25.214
TO GO. AND IT'S NOT COINCIDENCE

06:48:25.280 --> 06:48:26.481
THAT THE ZIP CODE YOU ARE BORN

06:48:26.548 --> 06:48:29.351
IN OFTENTIMES REFLECTS WHAT YOU

06:48:29.418 --> 06:48:31.253
LOOK LIKE THAT'S NOT A SECRET.

06:48:31.320 --> 06:48:32.421
IF YOU GREW UP IN THE

06:48:32.487 --> 06:48:34.756
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I REPRESENT.

06:48:34.823 --> 06:48:35.290
MORE THAN LIKELY YOU'LL BE

06:48:35.357 --> 06:48:38.393
LOOKING. IF YOU GO UP IN

06:48:38.460 --> 06:48:40.495
CERTAIN AREAS WITHOUT THE LATE

06:48:40.562 --> 06:48:41.096
MORE THAN LIKELY YOU COULD BE

06:48:41.163 --> 06:48:43.232
AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND WE'RE

06:48:43.298 --> 06:48:44.299
GONNA HAVE A HARDER TIME

06:48:44.366 --> 06:48:49.004
GETTING. SOME OF YOU I'VE HAD

06:48:49.071 --> 06:48:49.571
THIS CONVERSATION WITH BUT I

06:48:49.638 --> 06:48:51.740
NEVER REALLY SHARED PUBLICLY.

06:48:51.807 --> 06:48:53.542
YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN I WENT TO

06:48:53.609 --> 06:48:54.042
COMMUNITY COLLEGE YEAH I

06:48:54.109 --> 06:48:57.312
STRUGGLED. NIGHTFALL ONE EIGHTY

06:48:57.379 --> 06:48:57.846
SEVEN AND WE THOUGHT ONE

06:48:57.913 --> 06:48:59.581
PROPOSITION AND IT WAS FOR THIS

06:48:59.648 --> 06:49:01.650
HEARTENING TO KNOW. THAT NO

06:49:01.717 --> 06:49:04.119
MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED. I JUST

06:49:04.186 --> 06:49:05.621
DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO STUDY I

06:49:05.687 --> 06:49:06.388
DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO BE

06:49:06.455 --> 06:49:07.823
POLITICALLY ACTIVE. I COULD DO

06:49:07.890 --> 06:49:11.226
THOSE THINGS. AND WHEN APPLIED

06:49:11.293 --> 06:49:13.629
TO UCLA MY ONE DREAM. MY ONE

06:49:13.695 --> 06:49:15.664

I WAS THE NIGHT. I WAS DENIED

BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE

06:49:24.439 --> 06:49:28.176
GRADES. AND I WAS HEARTBROKEN.

06:49:28.243 --> 06:49:30.212
IT ALMOST DESTROYED MY LIFE I

06:49:30.279 --> 06:49:32.814
THINK THAT THE ONE OPPORTUNITY

06:49:32.881 --> 06:49:35.150
THAT I COULD HAVE TO HELP MY

06:49:35.217 --> 06:49:35.717

06:52:33.929 --> 06:52:35.330
DIRECTLY IMPACTS AND BENEFIT

06:52:35.397 --> 06:52:37.165
THOSE IN MY DISTRICT BY

06:52:37.232 --> 06:52:39.101
PROCLAIMING THEIR BACKGROUND.

06:52:39.167 --> 06:52:41.336
AND EXPERIENCES MATTER AND

06:52:41.403 --> 06:52:43.805
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR PUBLIC

06:52:43.872 --> 06:52:45.407
HIRING AND ADMISSION PURPOSES.

06:52:45.474 --> 06:52:47.275
REALLY DO NOT LIVE IN A COLOR

06:52:47.342 --> 06:52:50.479
BLIND SOCIETY SO IT IS TIME

06:52:50.545 --> 06:52:52.080
THAT WE STOP ACTING LIKE IT.

06:52:52.147 --> 06:52:54.049
WHEN I WAS DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE

06:52:54.116 --> 06:52:57.085
FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. I

06:52:57.152 --> 06:52:59.287
WOULD TELL MY STAFF WE WOULD

06:52:59.354 --> 06:53:01.022
HAVE AN AUCTION TO SELL CITY

06:53:01.089 --> 06:53:03.825
PROPERTY. THAT WE NEEDED TO

06:53:03.892 --> 06:53:06.361
ADVERTISE IN THE PAPERS AFTER

06:53:06.428 --> 06:53:08.130
AMERICAN LATINO FILIPINO

06:53:08.196 --> 06:53:11.266
JAPANESE. AND THE FIRST AUCTION

06:53:11.333 --> 06:53:13.301
THAT I WAS OVER THEY NEVER

06:53:13.368 --> 06:53:15.303
ADVERTISED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

06:53:15.370 --> 06:53:17.072
THEY ADVERTISE IN A

06:53:17.139 --> 06:53:19.441
PREDOMINATELY WHITE NEWSPAPERS.

06:53:19.508 --> 06:53:20.075
AND WHEN I BROUGHT THEM INTO MY

06:53:20.142 --> 06:53:24.446
OFFICE. ALL WHITE MALES. THEY

06:53:24.513 --> 06:53:27.649
TOLD ME BECAUSE OF THE PROP TWO

06:53:27.716 --> 06:53:28.250
OH NINE THE FACT THAT THEY

06:53:28.316 --> 06:53:30.252
DIDN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ANY

06:53:30.318 --> 06:53:32.187
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES

06:53:32.254 --> 06:53:34.289
THEY DID NOT HAVE TO ADVERTISE

06:53:34.356 --> 06:53:36.258
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND

06:53:36.324 --> 06:53:40.362
BESIDES. THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT.

06:53:40.428 --> 06:53:43.832
AFTER I CALMED DOWN. I MADE IT

06:53:43.899 --> 06:53:46.835
VERY CLEAR FROM AN ECONOMIC

06:53:46.902 --> 06:53:48.937
STANDPOINT THAT YOU'RE LEAVING

06:53:49.004 --> 06:53:51.206
OUT INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE THE

06:53:51.273 --> 06:53:53.208
CAPACITY TO PAY MORE FOR THE

06:53:53.275 --> 06:53:55.277
POOR THOSE PROPERTIES THEN THE

06:53:55.343 --> 06:53:57.445
PEOPLE YOU BELIEVE IN AND THAT

06:53:57.512 --> 06:53:59.681
YOU ARE GOING TO ADVERTISE IN

06:53:59.748 --> 06:54:02.951
THOSE PAPERS. SO I FORCED AND I

06:54:03.018 --> 06:54:05.353
NOTICE HOW READ THEIR FACES GOT

06:54:05.420 --> 06:54:07.889
AND HOW ANGRY THEY GOT. THE

06:54:07.956 --> 06:54:09.891
NEXT AUCTION WE HEAD. I WAS SO

06:54:09.958 --> 06:54:13.662
HAPPY. THAT THE HIGHEST PRICE

06:54:13.728 --> 06:54:18.033
FOR A PROPERTY IN THAT AUCTION.

06:54:18.099 --> 06:54:19.100
WENT TO A MEMBER OF THE LATINO

06:54:19.167 --> 06:54:21.636
COMMUNITY WHICH FURTHER PROVE

06:54:21.703 --> 06:54:24.706
TO ME AND TELL THEM THAT YOU

06:54:24.773 --> 06:54:26.274
NEED TO INCLUDE EVERYONE. BUT

06:54:26.341 --> 06:54:27.209
THE OTHER THING THAT I ALSO

06:54:27.275 --> 06:54:31.012
REALIZED WHY HE WAS SO ANGRY.

06:54:31.079 --> 06:54:33.248
WHY THEY WERE SO ANGRY. THEY

06:54:33.315 --> 06:54:35.217
DIDN'T NEVER THOUGHT IN THEIR

06:54:35.283 --> 06:54:38.887
CAREERS. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A

06:54:38.954 --> 06:54:39.487
BLACK MAN TELLING THEM WHAT TO

06:54:39.554 --> 06:54:42.857
DO. AND IN FACT I WAS PROBABLY

06:54:42.924 --> 06:54:46.428
THE WORST NIGHTMARE. IN FACT

06:54:46.494 --> 06:54:49.231
WHEN I SCORED NUMBER ONE ON THE

06:54:49.297 --> 06:54:51.933
TEST TO BE THEIR BOSS. OTHERS

06:54:52.000 --> 06:54:53.835
WERE TRYING TO UNDERMINE THAT

06:54:53.902 --> 06:54:56.938
BY PICKING SOMEONE A WHITE MALE

06:54:57.005 --> 06:54:58.473
FOR THAT POSITION EVEN THOUGH

06:54:58.540 --> 06:55:03.445
HE HAD NOT. PASS THE TEST.

06:55:03.511 --> 06:55:06.314
LUCKILY FOR ME. THE GENERAL

06:55:06.381 --> 06:55:09.251
MANAGER OF THE DEPARTMENT SAID

06:55:09.317 --> 06:55:11.753
WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH. THE

06:55:11.820 --> 06:55:16.291
NUMBER ONE CANDIDATE. AND I

06:55:16.358 --> 06:55:19.561
BELIEVE LUCKILY FOR ME THE

06:55:19.628 --> 06:55:21.229
GENERAL MANAGER WAS AN AFRICAN

06:55:21.296 --> 06:55:24.165
AMERICAN MALE. WHO WAS

06:55:24.232 --> 06:55:26.468
APPOINTED BY AN AFRICAN

06:55:26.534 --> 06:55:28.837
AMERICAN MAYOR. SO MAYOR TOM

06:55:28.903 --> 06:55:31.806
BRADLEY. APPOINTED MY GENERAL

06:55:31.873 --> 06:55:33.475
MANAGER HE WAS ELECTED NOT IN

06:55:33.541 --> 06:55:36.478
THE SEVENTIES. YOU POINT AT MY

06:55:36.544 --> 06:55:37.345
GENERAL MANAGERS IN THE

06:55:37.412 --> 06:55:40.048
NINETIES. AND THEN I WAS

06:55:40.115 --> 06:55:42.484
BROUGHT ON. IN THE YEAR TWO

06:55:42.550 --> 06:55:46.087
THOUSAND. IT WAS TO TRY TECH TO

06:55:46.154 --> 06:55:48.189
OF NIGHTMARES OF NIGHTMARES FOR

06:55:48.256 --> 06:55:51.059
ANY RACES IN ANY. COMMUNITY OR

ANY INFRASTRUCTURE BUT MORE

06:55:53.061 --> 06:55:55.630
IMPORTANT ANY BUREAUCRACY LIKE

06:55:55.697 --> 06:55:57.999
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. I WAS

06:55:58.066 --> 06:56:01.102
ABLE TO BREAK UP. THE RACISM

06:56:01.169 --> 06:56:03.705
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. BY BEING

06:56:03.772 --> 06:56:06.041
NUMBER ONE ON THE TEST BY

06:56:06.107 --> 06:56:08.109
STAYING TRUE TO MY NATURE BUT

06:56:08.176 --> 06:56:11.179
MOST IMPORTANT MAKING SHORT DID

06:56:11.246 --> 06:56:12.113
NOT DID NOT GO ALONG TO GET

06:56:12.180 --> 06:56:15.350
ALONG OR TO PERPETUATE THE WORD

06:56:15.417 --> 06:56:18.186
RACISM WITHIN MY DEPARTMENT AND

06:56:18.253 --> 06:56:20.955
DOING WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

06:56:21.022 --> 06:56:23.758
ON THE LEGACY THAT I STAND ON

06:56:23.825 --> 06:56:25.427
ON THE SHOULDERS THAT I STAND

06:56:25.493 --> 06:56:28.163
ON TO MAKE SURE THAT NEVER

06:56:28.229 --> 06:56:30.532
HAPPENS AGAIN. THE REPEAL OF

06:56:30.598 --> 06:56:33.368
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WAS

06:56:33.435 --> 06:56:35.003
TERRIBLE WE HAVE THE

06:56:35.070 --> 06:56:37.038
OPPORTUNITY TO LET THE VOTERS

06:56:37.105 --> 06:56:40.208
DECIDE. THE MISTAKE THAT WE

06:56:40.275 --> 06:56:41.509
MADE BECAUSE I VOTER DURING

06:56:41.576 --> 06:56:44.112
THAT TIME AND I VOTED AGAINST

06:56:44.179 --> 06:56:47.415
IT EVEN GOT. THE MAYOR OF LOS

06:56:47.482 --> 06:56:48.583
ANGELES WHEN I WAS ASSISTANT

06:56:48.650 --> 06:56:52.387
DEPUTY MAYOR. TO VOTE DOWN THE

06:56:52.454 --> 06:56:54.522
REPEAL OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

06:56:54.589 --> 06:56:56.491
THIRTY SECONDS SO WE ALL HAVE A

06:56:56.558 --> 06:56:58.860
STAKE IN THIS. AND WE ALL HAVE

06:56:58.927 --> 06:57:02.163
RIGHT NOW A BOAT IN THIS WE ALL

06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:04.099
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT

06:57:04.165 --> 06:57:08.970
A WRONG. ONE MEMBER AT A TIME

06:57:09.037 --> 06:57:11.139
ONE PERSON AT A AT A TIME. SO

06:57:11.206 --> 06:57:12.841
THAT THIS BECOMES A BETTER

06:57:12.907 --> 06:57:15.043
WORLD AND THANK GOD HOPEFULLY

06:57:15.110 --> 06:57:17.278
HOPEFULLY WE NEVER SEE WHAT'S

06:57:17.345 --> 06:57:18.880
HAPPENING IN THE STREETS AGAIN

06:57:18.947 --> 06:57:21.416
BECAUSE WE'VE NOW MOVED. WE

06:57:21.483 --> 06:57:22.984

ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE

06:57:36.064 --> 06:57:38.266
COMFORTABLE OPPOSING A CA FIVE

06:57:38.333 --> 06:57:40.268
BASED ON AN ASSERTION THAT RACE

06:57:40.335 --> 06:57:42.237
DOESN'T MATTER BUT FACTS ARE

06:57:42.303 --> 06:57:44.239
FACTS WHEN IT COMES TO

06:57:44.305 --> 06:57:48.009
EDUCATION JOBS SCHOOLS CRIMINAL

06:57:48.076 --> 06:57:49.744
JUSTICE AND HOMEOWNERSHIP.

06:57:49.811 --> 06:57:51.713
AFRICAN AMERICANS PEOPLE OF

06:57:51.780 --> 06:57:54.082
COLOR AND WOMEN HAVE SUFFERED

06:57:54.149 --> 06:57:56.985
DISCRIMINATION. ACA FIVE WILL

ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO VOTE TO

06:57:59.621 --> 06:58:01.423
HELP END THIS DISCRIMINATION

THANK YOU MISTER MAIENSCHEIN.

06:58:12.267 --> 06:58:13.301
MS CRISTINA GARCIA HERE

06:58:13.368 --> 06:58:15.637
RECOGNIZE THANK YOU I READ

06:58:15.703 --> 06:58:17.972
THROUGH THE PORT OF EIGHTY FIVE

06:58:18.039 --> 06:58:19.474
I TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO LIKE

06:58:19.541 --> 06:58:20.008
WITH THE DETAILS OUT THERE

06:58:20.074 --> 06:58:22.076
PROTESTING AS MAKING PHONE

06:58:22.143 --> 06:58:23.344
CALLS ALL TALKING AND DOORS

06:58:23.411 --> 06:58:25.713
AGAINST FIVE TWO ONE NINE AND

06:58:25.780 --> 06:58:27.649
MY ARGUMENT THEN IS THE SAME AS

06:58:27.715 --> 06:58:29.150
IT IS TODAY. UP TO A NINE IS

06:58:29.217 --> 06:58:29.984
ABOUT PUSHING A FALSE

06:58:30.051 --> 06:58:32.654
NARRATIVE. THAT WE HAVE AN

06:58:32.720 --> 06:58:34.289
EQUITABLE EQUAL SYSTEM. SO

06:58:34.355 --> 06:58:35.523
CALLED NEGATIVE THAT PEOPLE OF

06:58:35.590 --> 06:58:37.258
COLOR AND WOMEN ARE IN FULL

06:58:37.325 --> 06:58:38.927
CHARGE OF THEIR FAITH. BUT WE

06:58:38.993 --> 06:58:40.395
KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE BLACK OR

06:58:40.462 --> 06:58:41.963
BROWN IF YOU'RE A WOMAN. NO

06:58:42.030 --> 06:58:43.731
MORE LIKELY TO BE POOR MORE

06:58:43.798 --> 06:58:46.301
LIKELY TO LIVE IN POLLUTION. I

06:58:46.367 --> 06:58:46.868
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ON TRAIN

06:58:46.935 --> 06:58:48.870
TEACHERS. ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE

06:58:48.937 --> 06:58:52.140
INCARCERATED OR TO THEIR WHICH

06:58:52.207 --> 06:58:53.842
REALLY. AND THE LIST GOES ON.

06:58:53.908 --> 06:58:55.510
THIS FALSE NARRATIVE ALSO

06:58:55.577 --> 06:58:57.579
IMPLIES THAT WE FAIL TO SIXTY.

06:58:57.645 --> 06:58:58.112
BECAUSE WE DON'T TRY HARD

06:58:58.179 --> 06:59:00.949
ENOUGH. BECAUSE THIS IS THE

06:59:01.015 --> 06:59:02.917
REWARDS HARD WORK EQUALLY. WE

06:59:02.984 --> 06:59:05.186
ALSO NOTICED A SMALL. THE

06:59:05.253 --> 06:59:06.521
REALITY IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS

06:59:06.588 --> 06:59:08.223
MADE TO MAKE BROWN AND BLACK

06:59:08.289 --> 06:59:09.123
PEOPLE FEEL MORE OFTEN THAN

06:59:09.190 --> 06:59:11.559
NOT. AND IT'S AMERICA SOME OF

06:59:11.626 --> 06:59:13.495
THOSE DO HAVE MOBILITY. BUT

06:59:13.561 --> 06:59:15.330
WHEN WE DO THAT MOBILITY IS

06:59:15.396 --> 06:59:17.098
USED TO PRESERVE ALTERNATIVE.

06:59:17.165 --> 06:59:19.434
THAT WE WORK HARD ENOUGH WE CAN

06:59:19.501 --> 06:59:21.302
MAKE IT AND WE CAN BE A SUCCESS.

06:59:21.369 --> 06:59:22.370
THE REALITY IS THAT BEING A

06:59:22.437 --> 06:59:24.038
TOKEN. IS FAR FROM BEING AN

06:59:24.105 --> 06:59:27.575
EQUAL VOICE. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

06:59:27.642 --> 06:59:28.576
IS THAT ABOUT PREVENTIVE

06:59:28.643 --> 06:59:29.878
TREATMENT. IT'S ABOUT A

06:59:29.944 --> 06:59:31.513
KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THE SYSTEM IS

06:59:31.579 --> 06:59:33.681
AN EQUAL. THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM

06:59:33.748 --> 06:59:35.083
OF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND

06:59:35.149 --> 06:59:37.018
SEXISM. THAT MAKES IT MUCH

06:59:37.085 --> 06:59:39.254
HARDER. MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

06:59:39.320 --> 06:59:41.656
US I COULD DO EVERYTHING RIGHT

06:59:41.723 --> 06:59:42.790
IN BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN AND A

06:59:42.857 --> 06:59:44.826
WOMAN OF COLOR IS LIKELY NOT TO

06:59:44.893 --> 06:59:47.529
BE ENOUGH. EASY ADVISED

06:59:47.595 --> 06:59:48.596
OPPORTUNITIES THAT AGAINST THE

06:59:48.663 --> 06:59:50.498
SMALL OF NARRATIVE. IN TO BE AN

06:59:50.565 --> 06:59:52.567
ALLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS

06:59:52.634 --> 06:59:54.269
IS THE MOST ANYTHING BUT FAIR.

06:59:54.335 --> 06:59:55.837
WE HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO

06:59:55.904 --> 06:59:56.704
ENSURE WE HAVE INCREASED AT

06:59:56.771 --> 06:59:59.040
THE- TOP OF OPPORTUNITY FOR

06:59:59.107 --> 07:00:00.975
PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN. AND

07:00:01.042 --> 07:00:02.577
MAYBE CLEARLY HAVE THAT

07:00:02.644 --> 07:00:04.712
OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY DO WE RISE

07:00:04.779 --> 07:00:05.780
TO THE OCCASION BUT WE NEED

07:00:05.847 --> 07:00:06.981
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT TO

07:00:07.048 --> 07:00:09.350
BE. TWICE AS GOOD FOR D. SANTA

07:00:09.417 --> 07:00:10.952
FOR GOOD. AND SO I HOPE THAT

07:00:11.019 --> 07:00:12.220
TODAY WE HAVE CORRECT AND

07:00:12.287 --> 07:00:13.588
JUSTICE THAT WAS THE TWENTY

07:00:13.655 --> 07:00:15.089
FIVE YEARS AGO AT THE BALLOT.

07:00:15.156 --> 07:00:16.591
IN IS NOT ENOUGH TO VOTE YES ON

07:00:16.658 --> 07:00:18.126
THE CA FIVE. WILL BE ON YOUR

07:00:18.192 --> 07:00:19.627
DISTRICT YOU CAMPAIGN BETWEEN

07:00:19.694 --> 07:00:21.863
NOW AND NOVEMBER TO MAKE SURE

07:00:21.930 --> 07:00:26.434
THAT WE PULL THIS AND WE. AND

RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER

07:00:32.740 --> 07:00:35.143
SPEAKER MEMBERS- I RISE TODAY

07:00:35.209 --> 07:00:37.145
IS AS SOMEONE WHO IS DEEPLY

07:00:37.211 --> 07:00:39.480
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RACIAL

07:00:39.547 --> 07:00:41.549
DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE IN OUR

07:00:41.616 --> 07:00:47.889
EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND. YOU KNOW

07:00:47.956 --> 07:00:48.423
WE'VE BEEN CONFRONTED ONCE

07:00:48.489 --> 07:00:51.659
AGAIN. IN THIS COUNTRY WITH THE

07:00:51.726 --> 07:00:53.928
FACT THAT THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL

07:00:53.995 --> 07:00:55.630
AND THAT AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID.

07:00:55.697 --> 07:01:01.269
REYES DOES MATTER. BUT AS I

07:01:01.336 --> 07:01:03.571
STAND AND CONSIDER THIS MEASURE.

07:01:03.638 --> 07:01:05.640
I CAN'T SAY THAT PROP TWO OH

07:01:05.707 --> 07:01:07.942
NINE IS THE PROBLEM. IT'S MUCH

07:01:08.009 --> 07:01:10.612
DEEPER THAN THAT WHEN WE LOOK

07:01:10.678 --> 07:01:12.680
AT THAT AND I AND I APPRECIATE

07:01:12.747 --> 07:01:14.082
THE COMMENTS THAT WE'VE- THAT

07:01:14.148 --> 07:01:15.550
HAVE BEEN STATED HERE ON THIS

07:01:15.617 --> 07:01:16.451
FOR TODAY AND THE AND THE

07:01:16.517 --> 07:01:18.353
EXPERIENCES THAT. MY COLLEAGUES

07:01:18.419 --> 07:01:19.754
HAVE SHARED TODAY THOSE ARE

07:01:19.821 --> 07:01:21.489
IMPORTANT AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE

07:01:21.556 --> 07:01:23.524
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. TO TALK

07:01:23.591 --> 07:01:24.926
ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE ROOT

07:01:24.993 --> 07:01:29.297
CAUSES. THE INEQUITIES THAT. WE

07:01:29.364 --> 07:01:30.732
CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY IN OUR

07:01:30.798 --> 07:01:33.968
EDUCATION SYSTEM. BUT I SAY

07:01:34.035 --> 07:01:35.770
THAT PROP TWO NINE IS NOT THE

07:01:35.837 --> 07:01:38.139
PROBLEM- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

07:01:38.206 --> 07:01:41.009
STATS- THE GETTING RID OF A

07:01:41.075 --> 07:01:43.478
RACIAL PREFERENCES DID NOT

07:01:43.544 --> 07:01:45.546
ACTUALLY LEAD TO DECREASES IT

07:01:45.613 --> 07:01:47.915
ACTUALLY LEAD TO INCREASES- AND

07:01:47.982 --> 07:01:50.685
LATINO STUDENTS BEING ADMITTED

07:01:50.752 --> 07:01:54.222
IT LEAD TO INCREASES IN ASIAN

07:01:54.288 --> 07:01:54.722
AMERICAN STUDENTS BEING

07:01:54.789 --> 07:01:56.891
ADMITTED. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

07:01:56.958 --> 07:02:00.294
THE STATS. ADMISSIONS OF BLACK

07:02:00.361 --> 07:02:03.164
STUDENTS REMAINED STAGNANT. IN

07:02:03.231 --> 07:02:05.867
THE UC SYSTEM 4% THERE HASN'T

07:02:05.933 --> 07:02:08.302
IN PROGRESS THERE. THAT'S A

07:02:08.369 --> 07:02:10.405
PROBLEM LET'S GO A LITTLE BIT

07:02:10.471 --> 07:02:11.839
DEEPER IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT A

07:02:11.906 --> 07:02:14.342
MISSION BECAUSE LET'S TALK

07:02:14.409 --> 07:02:14.876
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN

07:02:14.942 --> 07:02:17.445
RETAINING STUDENTS WHILE

07:02:17.512 --> 07:02:19.347
THEY'RE IN. HIGHER EDUCATION.

07:02:19.414 --> 07:02:21.082
THE STATS SHOW THAT 38% OF

07:02:21.149 --> 07:02:23.551
BLACK STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR

07:02:23.618 --> 07:02:27.121
YEARS FROM THE UC SYSTEM. IN

07:02:27.188 --> 07:02:30.158
CSU IT'S EVEN MORE SINCE 8% SO

07:02:30.224 --> 07:02:31.492
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT EMISSIONS

07:02:31.559 --> 07:02:35.396
AND USING BRING BACK FROM AN OF

07:02:35.463 --> 07:02:36.030
ACTION BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO

07:02:36.097 --> 07:02:38.232
ENSURE THAT. BLACK AND BROWN

07:02:38.299 --> 07:02:39.967
STUDENTS GRADUATE AND GET THAT

07:02:40.034 --> 07:02:41.636
EDUCATION THAT'S A

07:02:41.703 --> 07:02:44.806
CONVERSATION. THAT WE NEED TO

07:02:44.872 --> 07:02:45.406
BE HAPPENED WE NEED TO GO EVEN

07:02:45.473 --> 07:02:47.809
DEEPER. BUT LET'S TAKE EVEN TO

07:02:47.875 --> 07:02:49.177
THE NEXT LEVEL BECAUSE THIS

07:02:49.243 --> 07:02:50.912
STARTS WAY BEFORE. HIGHER

07:02:50.978 --> 07:02:54.615
EDUCATION. NOW IS ONE OF MY

07:02:54.682 --> 07:02:56.217
COLLEAGUES SAYS IT DOESN'T

07:02:56.284 --> 07:02:57.218
MATTER WHERE YOU WHERE YOU

07:02:57.285 --> 07:02:59.687
LIVE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

07:02:59.754 --> 07:03:04.258
YOUR ZIP CODE IS. IN OUR CASE

07:03:04.325 --> 07:03:08.062
THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION SYSTEM.

07:03:08.129 --> 07:03:09.530
RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE SOME

07:03:09.597 --> 07:03:14.102
SERIOUS RACIAL DISPARITIES. AND

07:03:14.168 --> 07:03:15.403
SOME OF US HAVE ADVOCATED FOR

07:03:15.470 --> 07:03:17.839
REFORMS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

07:03:17.905 --> 07:03:20.208
DEAL WITH THAT VERY ISSUE. THIS

07:03:20.274 --> 07:03:23.878
IS NOT SOMETHING NEW. NINE

07:03:23.945 --> 07:03:27.281
MINORITY STUDENTS. STOOD UP AND

07:03:27.348 --> 07:03:29.117
BROUGHT A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE

07:03:29.183 --> 07:03:31.419
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF

07:03:31.486 --> 07:03:32.787
THESE PROBLEMS IN OUR

07:03:32.854 --> 07:03:36.591
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AND THIS

07:03:36.657 --> 07:03:37.992
STATE GOVERNMENT FOUGHT THEM

07:03:38.059 --> 07:03:40.094
TOOTH AND NAIL IN THE REGARD

07:03:40.161 --> 07:03:44.365
VERSUS- CALIFORNIA DECISION.

07:03:44.432 --> 07:03:46.067
GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN FOUGHT

07:03:46.134 --> 07:03:50.037
THEM TOOTH AND NAIL. SAY NO

07:03:50.104 --> 07:03:50.571
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THOSE

07:03:50.638 --> 07:03:53.541
SYSTEMS IN PLACE. AND THE

07:03:53.608 --> 07:03:55.143
AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION

07:03:55.209 --> 07:03:56.310
BROUGHT HER OWN LEGISLATION

07:03:56.377 --> 07:03:58.146
SAYING WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE

07:03:58.212 --> 07:04:03.484
TENURE FOR EXAMPLE. AND THIS

07:04:03.551 --> 07:04:05.453
LEGISLATIVE BODY KILLED THAT

07:04:05.520 --> 07:04:09.056
LEGISLATION. THE CHANGES THAT

07:04:09.123 --> 07:04:11.559
MINORITY STUDENTS ARE BRINGING

07:04:11.626 --> 07:04:12.093
TO US SAYING PLEASE CHANGE

07:04:12.160 --> 07:04:14.428
THESE THINGS. THE GIVE US

07:04:14.495 --> 07:04:15.797
BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE IT

07:04:15.863 --> 07:04:16.731
SO THAT IT'S NOT WHERE IS IT

07:04:16.798 --> 07:04:19.667
CODE IS THAT IS NOT MY RACE.

07:04:19.734 --> 07:04:21.836
THE DETERMINES MY SUCCESS IN MY

07:04:21.903 --> 07:04:23.738
ABILITY TO GET AN EDUCATION THE

07:04:23.805 --> 07:04:25.673
THINGS THAT THEY BROUGHT TO US

07:04:25.740 --> 07:04:28.509
THIS BODY. KILLED IN THIS IN

07:04:28.576 --> 07:04:31.012
THIS IN THIS BUILDING DESPITE

07:04:31.078 --> 07:04:31.646
THE EFFORTS OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

07:04:31.712 --> 07:04:33.815
IN THIS ROOM. BUT THE BOTTOM

07:04:33.881 --> 07:04:35.917
LINE IS THE MAJORITY SAID NO.

07:04:35.983 --> 07:04:40.087
SO IT'S A LOT DEEPER. THEN JUST

07:04:40.154 --> 07:04:42.390
TALKING ABOUT PROP TWO OH NINE.

07:04:42.456 --> 07:04:43.825

07:04:43.891 --> 07:04:45.426
FIRST OUT POLICY THT WE HAVE

07:04:45.493 --> 07:04:49.797
FOR TEACHERS. IS TALKING ABOUT

07:04:49.864 --> 07:04:53.534
IN LA UNIFIED IN THAT TRIAL.

MANY TIMES OVER PERCENTAGE WAS

07:05:03.511 --> 07:05:07.615
LIKELY. TO BE TAUGHT BY A

07:05:07.682 --> 07:05:10.017
TEACHER IN THE 5% EFFECTIVENESS

07:05:10.084 --> 07:05:13.221

STUDENTS WERE 43% MORE LIKELY

07:05:19.427 --> 07:05:20.261
THAN WHITE STUDENTS TO BE

07:05:20.328 --> 07:05:21.429
TAUGHT BY A TEACHER IN THE

07:05:21.495 --> 07:05:23.464
BOTTOM FIVE PERCENT. LATINO

GET TO HIGHER EDUCATION WAY

07:05:40.047 --> 07:05:42.683

CALIFORNIA. THEY GOT A CHANCE

07:07:28.689 --> 07:07:30.691
TO VOTE ON IT AT THE BALLOT. SO

PUBLIC REVIEW OF CASES WITH A

07:08:33.354 --> 07:08:34.989
LOOK AT ALL THESE FACTORS AND

07:08:35.056 --> 07:08:36.824
SO. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE

07:08:36.891 --> 07:08:38.559
THIS QUARTER SYSTEM IN PLACE.

07:08:38.626 --> 07:08:40.828
REALLY CHANGING THE PROCESS HOW

AND WHO DOESN'T FOR YOU SEE.

07:08:54.408 --> 07:08:56.110
BUT THIS WHAT THIS WILL DO

07:08:56.177 --> 07:08:58.045

AND IT WAS QUITE A CONVERSATION

07:12:15.142 --> 07:12:17.378
THERE WAS NOT AN AGREEMENT AND

07:12:17.444 --> 07:12:20.047
IT ACTUALLY CAUSED QUITE A BIT

07:12:20.114 --> 07:12:23.917

07:12:52.846 --> 07:12:55.816

SOMEONE ELSE WHEN THEY DON'T

07:13:20.774 --> 07:13:22.676
DESERVE IT. BUT I'M GONNA

07:13:22.743 --> 07:13:24.011
QUICKLY SHARE A FEW OF MY

07:13:24.078 --> 07:13:26.480
STORIES IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX

07:13:26.547 --> 07:13:28.949
I WAS THIRTY TWO YEARS OLD WITH

07:13:29.016 --> 07:13:30.017
THREE YOUNG CHILDREN SEVEN

07:13:30.084 --> 07:13:31.752
YEARS OLD SIX YEARS OLD AND A

07:13:31.819 --> 07:13:33.587
THREE YEAR OLD AND A CLASSROOM

07:13:33.654 --> 07:13:35.989
TEACHER I HAD BEEN TEACHING FOR

07:13:36.056 --> 07:13:38.359
ALMOST TEN YEARS BY THAT TIME

07:13:38.425 --> 07:13:41.362
AND RIGHT AFTER PROP TWO NINE I

07:13:41.428 --> 07:13:44.164
WENT BACK TO THE CLASSROOM. AND

07:13:44.231 --> 07:13:45.599
ARE BILINGUAL PROGRAMS WERE

07:13:45.666 --> 07:13:48.769
DISMANTLED. SO WITH IN A SHORT

07:13:48.836 --> 07:13:51.305
FEW MONTHS. CHILDREN THAT WERE

07:13:51.372 --> 07:13:53.540
IN BILINGUAL PROGRAMS. THAT

07:13:53.607 --> 07:13:54.875
WERE LEARNING THAT WAY THOSE

07:13:54.942 --> 07:13:57.044
PROGRAMS WERE DISMANTLED WE HAD

07:13:57.111 --> 07:13:58.812
BEEN TRAINED IN VARIOUS

07:13:58.879 --> 07:14:00.614
PRACTICES THROUGH THE STATE OF

07:14:00.681 --> 07:14:02.316
CALIFORNIA. AND THEY WERE JUST

07:14:02.383 --> 07:14:06.120
RACED. WITH THAT BEING SAID IF

07:14:06.186 --> 07:14:07.654
YOU WERE A PERSON OF COLOR

07:14:07.721 --> 07:14:09.490
PARTICULARLY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

07:14:09.556 --> 07:14:12.259
ORANGE COUNTY FULLER TEN WE

07:14:12.326 --> 07:14:13.694
WERE TRACKED WE WERE TRAPPED

07:14:13.761 --> 07:14:16.130
RIGHT INTO BILINGUAL PROGRAMS

07:14:16.196 --> 07:14:16.964
WHETHER WE WERE BI LINGUAL OR

07:14:17.030 --> 07:14:20.634
NOT. AND THAT MEANT USUALLY NOT

07:14:20.701 --> 07:14:22.770
AN OPTION FOR COLLEGE I WAS THE

07:14:22.836 --> 07:14:24.304
FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO

07:14:24.371 --> 07:14:26.607
COLLEGE BUT MANY OF MY

07:14:26.673 --> 07:14:28.642
COUNSELORS IN HIGH SCHOOL. DID

07:14:28.709 --> 07:14:30.077
YOU EVEN THINK THAT I WAS A

07:14:30.144 --> 07:14:32.613
CANDIDATE. AS I CAME FROM A

07:14:32.679 --> 07:14:35.349
FAMILY OF TEN AND UP NOBODY IN

07:14:35.416 --> 07:14:37.551
MY FAMILY HAD BEEN TO COLLEGE

07:14:37.618 --> 07:14:40.354
BEFORE BUT THE POINT IS THAT WE

07:14:40.421 --> 07:14:42.489
WERE OFTEN DISCOUNTED HOUSING

07:14:42.556 --> 07:14:45.392
POLICIES IN MY AREA LATINO

07:14:45.459 --> 07:14:48.395
FAMILY OWNS WORK UP PUSHED INTO

07:14:48.462 --> 07:14:50.831
ONE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THAT WAS

07:14:50.898 --> 07:14:53.233
A POLICY AT THAT TIME SO WHEN

07:14:53.300 --> 07:14:54.735
WE LOOK TO NOW WHEN WE TALK

07:14:54.802 --> 07:14:57.004
ABOUT THIS POLICY THERE IS A

07:14:57.070 --> 07:14:59.440
HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EQUITY.

07:14:59.506 --> 07:15:01.775
AND EQUALITY AND THAT IS SO

07:15:01.842 --> 07:15:04.111
HARD FOR PEOPLE. THEY REALLY

07:15:04.178 --> 07:15:07.347
WANT EVERYTHING TO BE FAIR. BUT

OURSELVES. RACE DOES MATTER.

07:30:46.686 --> 07:30:48.888
WE'RE BEYOND FIFTY YEARS PASSED

07:30:48.955 --> 07:30:50.990

07:30:51.057 --> 07:30:51.858
RIGHTS ACT AND THE VOTING

07:30:51.924 --> 07:30:54.727
RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY

07:30:54.794 --> 07:30:55.995
FIVE I DID WASN'T CUTTING GROUP

07:30:56.062 --> 07:30:57.463
GROPE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

07:30:57.530 --> 07:30:58.831
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL OF

07:30:58.898 --> 07:30:59.999
THAT WAS WAS ALL ABOUT I WAS

07:31:00.066 --> 07:31:02.568
BORN IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND

07:31:02.635 --> 07:31:03.970
FOR ME I DIDN'T SEE ALL OF

07:31:04.036 --> 07:31:06.172
THOSE THOSE THINGS. BUT WHEN I

07:31:06.239 --> 07:31:08.207
WAS NINETEEN I HAD HOPED THAT

07:31:08.274 --> 07:31:09.208
WE HAD GOTTEN BEYOND ALL OF

07:31:09.275 --> 07:31:12.545
THAT AND THE TRUTH IS TWENTY

07:31:12.612 --> 07:31:14.547
FIVE YEARS LATER IT IS VERY

07:31:14.614 --> 07:31:17.049
CLEAR THAT WE HAVE WE ARE NOT

07:31:17.116 --> 07:31:19.685
BEYOND THAT AND THE FACT IS IT

07:31:19.752 --> 07:31:22.955
HAS BEEN. A GENERATION. BEFORE

07:31:23.022 --> 07:31:24.123
CALIFORNIANS HAVE HAD THE

07:31:24.190 --> 07:31:26.225
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP.

07:31:26.292 --> 07:31:28.494
AND PINE ON THIS. AND I THINK

07:31:28.561 --> 07:31:30.963
IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THIS BODY

07:31:31.030 --> 07:31:32.498
FROM TIME TO TIME LOOKING AT

07:31:32.565 --> 07:31:34.667
OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. TO PUT

07:31:34.734 --> 07:31:36.469
THOSE QUESTIONS BACK BEFORE THE

07:31:36.536 --> 07:31:38.004
VOTERS AND SAY IS THIS STILL

07:31:38.070 --> 07:31:39.972
WHAT YOU WANT. TO BE IN YOUR

07:31:40.039 --> 07:31:42.341
CONSTITUTION. AND FOR THAT

07:31:42.408 --> 07:31:44.310
REASON I THINK IT IS MORE THAN

07:31:44.377 --> 07:31:45.878
APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE ABLE

07:31:45.945 --> 07:31:48.247
TO SEND THIS ACA FIVE TO BE

07:31:48.314 --> 07:31:49.315
ABLE TO GET ON THE BALLOT. IN

07:31:49.382 --> 07:31:51.184
NOVEMBER AND ASK THIS QUESTION

07:31:51.250 --> 07:31:54.086
OF WHERE THE CALIFORNIANS WANT

07:31:54.153 --> 07:31:55.588
TO MOVE IN THE FUTURE. IF WE

07:31:55.655 --> 07:31:58.591
JUST LISTEN AND I GUESS IS THE

07:31:58.658 --> 07:31:59.826
OTHER THING THAT I WOULD WANT

07:31:59.892 --> 07:32:01.093
TO SAY IS WE'VE BEEN OVER THE

07:32:01.160 --> 07:32:03.062
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WE'VE

07:32:03.129 --> 07:32:05.264
WE'VE SEEN THIS EVERYONE SAYS-

07:32:05.331 --> 07:32:06.365
I'VE GOT THE ANSWERS BECAUSE

07:32:06.432 --> 07:32:09.268
WHEN I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD I

07:32:09.335 --> 07:32:09.869

07:32:10.436 --> 07:32:13.105
SMARTEST GUY THAT I KNEW- STE

07:32:13.172 --> 07:32:14.774
SOME OF YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY SAY

07:32:14.841 --> 07:32:16.209
THAT CHECK GIVEN CHANGE MUCH.

07:32:16.275 --> 07:32:19.579
FROM A BUT- BUT WHAT I REALIZE

07:32:19.645 --> 07:32:21.147
IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE

07:32:21.214 --> 07:32:22.215

07:32:22.281 --> 07:32:23.816

07:33:54.140 --> 07:33:54.540
SUCH A BROAD RANGE OF

07:33:54.607 --> 07:33:59.812
PERSPECTIVES. BEING REPRESENTED.

07:33:59.879 --> 07:34:03.849
I WANT TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN

07:34:03.916 --> 07:34:06.485
ACKNOWLEDGING THE MOMENT THAT

07:34:06.552 --> 07:34:10.823
WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. I THINK A-

07:34:10.890 --> 07:34:12.525
YOU KNOW RECENT EVENTS ARE

07:34:12.592 --> 07:34:14.894
CLEARLY SHOWN THAT THE

07:34:14.961 --> 07:34:15.962
CORONAVIRUSES HAD A

07:34:16.028 --> 07:34:19.165
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON

07:34:19.231 --> 07:34:21.400
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES.

07:34:21.467 --> 07:34:23.769
THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD

07:34:23.836 --> 07:34:25.605
ANOTHER YOUNG BLACK MEN IS

07:34:25.671 --> 07:34:29.108
CLEARLY SHOWED. THAT WE STILL

07:34:29.175 --> 07:34:32.511
LIVE IN A RACIST AND SEXIST

07:34:32.578 --> 07:34:36.816
SOCIETY. AND I WOULD AGREE WITH

07:34:36.882 --> 07:34:38.718
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE

07:34:38.784 --> 07:34:41.287
TALKED ABOUT HOW RACE STILL

07:34:41.354 --> 07:34:44.657
MATTERS GENDER SO MATTERS. AND

07:34:44.724 --> 07:34:46.058
THAT WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

07:34:46.125 --> 07:34:49.528
THIS REALITY. BY OPENLY

07:34:49.595 --> 07:34:52.031
CONSIDERING RATHER THAN

07:34:52.098 --> 07:34:56.502
PRETENDING. THAT WE LIVE IN A

07:34:56.569 --> 07:34:57.103
COLOR BLIND AND GENDER NEUTRAL

07:34:57.169 --> 07:35:00.439
SOCIETY THAT WE DO NEED TO

07:35:00.506 --> 07:35:03.709
OPENLY. CONSIDER RACE AND

07:35:03.776 --> 07:35:08.481
GENDER. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

07:35:08.547 --> 07:35:13.486
THAT THE VOICES THAT ALL VOICES

07:35:13.552 --> 07:35:16.889
ARE HEARD IN THIS DEBATE AND I

07:35:16.956 --> 07:35:19.325
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE VOICES.

07:35:19.392 --> 07:35:20.026
AND THE ASIAN AMERICAN

07:35:20.092 --> 07:35:23.896
COMMUNITY THAT HAVE NOT. BEEN

07:35:23.963 --> 07:35:25.698
DONE JUSTICE IN OUR

07:35:25.765 --> 07:35:27.466
CONVERSATION THUS FAR AND SO I

07:35:27.533 --> 07:35:32.171
WANT TO. RAISE A VOICE FOR.

07:35:32.238 --> 07:35:35.274
MANY NOT ALL BECAUSE THE ASIAN

07:35:35.341 --> 07:35:36.676
AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS EXTREMELY

07:35:36.742 --> 07:35:40.546
DIVERSE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE

07:35:40.613 --> 07:35:42.882
SURE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE

07:35:42.948 --> 07:35:47.453
HEARD IN THIS DEBATE. ASIAN

07:35:47.520 --> 07:35:49.755
AMERICANS EVEN DURING THIS

07:35:49.822 --> 07:35:52.725
CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC I MEAN WE

07:35:52.792 --> 07:35:55.361
HAVE EXPERIENCED RACISM WE HAVE

07:35:55.428 --> 07:35:58.864
BEEN ATTACKED. THE VICTIMS OF

07:35:58.931 --> 07:36:03.002
MORE HATE CRIMES BECAUSE OF OUR

07:36:03.069 --> 07:36:05.071
PRESIDENT THAT CALLS THIS. THE

07:36:05.137 --> 07:36:09.241
WUHAN VIRUS THE CHINESE VIRUS.

07:36:09.308 --> 07:36:10.810
THAT A JAPANESE GUY LIKE ME IS

07:36:10.876 --> 07:36:13.179
GETTING ATTACKED OR YOU KNOW AT

07:36:13.245 --> 07:36:16.048
RISK OF BEING ATTACKED BECAUSE

07:36:16.115 --> 07:36:17.850
IN THE EYES OF SO MANY

07:36:17.917 --> 07:36:23.055
AMERICANS WE ALL LOOK THE SAME.

07:36:23.122 --> 07:36:24.523
ASIAN AMERICAN THIS IS JUST THE

07:36:24.590 --> 07:36:26.492
LATEST EXAMPLE OF HOW ASIAN

07:36:26.559 --> 07:36:30.930
AMERICANS ARE NOT. IMMUNE FROM

07:36:30.996 --> 07:36:33.733
RACISM HERE AND NOW AND OF

07:36:33.799 --> 07:36:38.604
COURSE ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN.

07:36:38.671 --> 07:36:40.439
ARE JUST AS MUCH VICTIMS OF

07:36:40.506 --> 07:36:45.745
SEXISM. IF NOT MORE. AND SO

07:36:45.811 --> 07:36:47.947
THAT IS THE REASON WHY. THE

07:36:48.013 --> 07:36:51.217
MAJORITY OF ASIAN AMERICANS

07:36:51.283 --> 07:36:53.986
SUPPORT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BUT

07:36:54.053 --> 07:36:55.921
WE SUPPORT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

07:36:55.988 --> 07:36:58.624
AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO

07:36:58.691 --> 07:37:03.863
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S- DONE IN A

07:37:03.929 --> 07:37:06.499
WAY THAT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE

07:37:06.565 --> 07:37:09.502
AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS THAT

07:37:09.568 --> 07:37:13.272
DOESN'T UNFAIRLY. LIMIT OR

07:37:13.339 --> 07:37:16.475
EXCLUDE. IN A MEMBERS OF OUR

07:37:16.542 --> 07:37:21.781
COMMUNITY. IN THE PRACTICE OF

07:37:21.847 --> 07:37:25.351
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. ASIAN

07:37:25.417 --> 07:37:26.352
AMERICANS ARE DIVERSE AMMANAI

07:37:26.418 --> 07:37:29.588
AT THE RISK OF ENGAGING IN

07:37:29.655 --> 07:37:34.260
STEREOTYPES A MAN WE HAVE A

07:37:34.326 --> 07:37:34.860
WEALTHY RECENT IMMIGRANTS FROM

07:37:34.927 --> 07:37:36.562
CHINA. WE HAVE FOURTH

07:37:36.629 --> 07:37:38.464
GENERATION JAPANESE AMERICANS

07:37:38.531 --> 07:37:39.999
LIVING IN MIDDLE CLASS SUBURBS

07:37:40.065 --> 07:37:41.967
WE HAVE COLLEGE EDUCATED

07:37:42.034 --> 07:37:43.435
KOREANS AND SOUTH ASIAN

07:37:43.502 --> 07:37:45.337
IMMIGRANTS WORKING IN GROCERY

07:37:45.404 --> 07:37:49.141
STORES THIRTY SECONDS. AND YET

07:37:49.208 --> 07:37:51.677
THE ONE THING THAT BRINGS ALL

07:37:51.744 --> 07:37:54.847
ASIAN AMERICANS TOGETHER IS.

07:37:54.914 --> 07:37:58.150
THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION AS

07:37:58.217 --> 07:38:00.186
YOU KNOW THE TICKET FOR OUR

07:38:00.252 --> 07:38:00.686
CHILDREN TO ACHIEVE THE

07:38:00.753 --> 07:38:02.988
AMERICAN DREAM. THERE IS A

07:38:03.055 --> 07:38:05.191
WIDELY HELD PERCEPTION AMONG

07:38:05.257 --> 07:38:07.493
MANY ASIANS THAT WE HAVE TO

07:38:07.560 --> 07:38:09.361
WORK HARDER AND GET BETTER

07:38:09.428 --> 07:38:11.330
GRADES AND HIGHER TEST SCORES

07:38:11.397 --> 07:38:13.599
TO GET INTO THE MOST

07:38:13.666 --> 07:38:14.133
COMPETITIVE SCHOOLS IN OUR

07:38:14.200 --> 07:38:20.239
COUNTRY. AND THAT. THAT

07:38:20.306 --> 07:38:24.577
PERCEPTION CONTINUES TO GET

07:38:24.643 --> 07:38:27.980
HAVE SOME SUPPORT. IN THE DATA

07:38:28.047 --> 07:38:29.315
THAT I RECEIVED RECENTLY FROM

07:38:29.381 --> 07:38:30.783
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I

07:38:30.850 --> 07:38:32.451
MEAN ADMISSION RATES FOR ALL

07:38:32.518 --> 07:38:34.420
GROUPS HAVE DROPPED BECAUSE THE

07:38:34.486 --> 07:38:37.857
APPLICATIONS. HAVE DRAMATICALLY

07:38:37.923 --> 07:38:40.860
INCREASED IN THE PAST TWENTY

07:38:40.926 --> 07:38:42.094
FIVE YEARS EVER SINCE PROP TWO

07:38:42.161 --> 07:38:45.097
OH NINE PASS PLEASE INCLUDE.

07:38:45.164 --> 07:38:47.533
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. IS

07:38:47.600 --> 07:38:51.437
THAT. ASIAN AMERICANS JUST LIKE

07:38:51.503 --> 07:38:55.441
ANYONE ELSE. WE ARE SEEKING

07:38:55.507 --> 07:39:02.248
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. WE WANT. TO

07:39:02.314 --> 07:39:07.353
BE TREATED FAIRLY. AFFIRMATIVE

07:39:07.419 --> 07:39:10.956
ACTION IF DONE RIGHT. IT IS TO

07:39:11.023 --> 07:39:13.325
PROMOTE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND

07:39:13.392 --> 07:39:17.596
DIVERSITY FOR ALL. AND SO I

07:39:17.663 --> 07:39:18.197
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

07:39:18.264 --> 07:39:22.067

THE REPEAL OF PROPOSITION TWO

07:39:23.669 --> 07:39:27.339
OR NINE. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT

07:39:27.406 --> 07:39:30.476
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WORKS FOR

07:39:30.542 --> 07:39:31.911
ALL COMMUNITIES AND THAT DOES

07:39:31.977 --> 07:39:36.282
NOT. UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATE

07:39:36.348 --> 07:39:37.716

BLACK PEOPLE EVERYBODY ELSE.

07:40:57.763 --> 07:40:58.831
FOR THE API COMMUNITY SOUTHEAST

07:40:58.897 --> 07:41:00.232
ASIANS LAWFUL ARE GOING TO

07:41:00.299 --> 07:41:01.867
BENEFIT FROM THIS JUST TO HAVE

07:41:01.934 --> 07:41:03.502
A CHANCE SO THINK ABOUT THAT A

07:41:03.569 --> 07:41:06.205
RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS.

07:41:06.271 --> 07:41:07.139
HOW MY FOUR DOLLARS HAVE A

07:41:07.206 --> 07:41:09.008
CHANCE THEIR THEIR BLACK WOMEN.

07:41:09.074 --> 07:41:10.442
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS FOR

07:41:10.509 --> 07:41:12.144
THE PAST FOUR YEARS I'VE BEEN

07:41:12.211 --> 07:41:13.645
THE PAY EQUITY BILL FOR WOMEN

07:41:13.712 --> 07:41:15.547
IN THE LEGISLATURE. INITIALLY

07:41:15.614 --> 07:41:17.416
THE BILL IS WORKING WITH THE

07:41:17.483 --> 07:41:18.984
ADMINISTRATION ON IT NO FOR THE

07:41:19.051 --> 07:41:21.553
BILL GETS THROUGH BUT WHO KNOWS

07:41:21.620 --> 07:41:24.189
BUT WE KELLY CHART TELLS ME

07:41:24.256 --> 07:41:25.290
COULD TAKE TEN YEARS. TO BRING

07:41:25.357 --> 07:41:27.760
UP THE PAY OF WOMEN TO MEN. IN

07:41:27.826 --> 07:41:29.828
STATE SERVICE THAT IS INSANE.

07:41:29.895 --> 07:41:32.197
THAT IS FAR TOO LONG. THINK

07:41:32.264 --> 07:41:32.798
ABOUT THAT TEN YEARS TO BRING

07:41:32.865 --> 07:41:34.767
UP. IF YOU'RE FEMALE CHIEF IN

07:41:34.833 --> 07:41:37.569
THIS BUILDING. YOU MAKE LESS

07:41:37.636 --> 07:41:39.671
THAN MIL CHIEFS DO. WHY IS

07:41:39.738 --> 07:41:41.940
THAT. I CAME FROM I REFER

07:41:42.007 --> 07:41:43.409
COUNTY FOR THIRTY YEARS IN A

07:41:43.475 --> 07:41:44.777
CITY FOR FIFTEEN. AND WHATEVER

07:41:44.843 --> 07:41:46.345
THAT CLASSIFICATION WAS MADE

07:41:46.412 --> 07:41:48.280
THE SAME PAY IN THAT JOB

07:41:48.347 --> 07:41:50.516
DESCRIPTION HERE THE CAPITAL.

07:41:50.582 --> 07:41:52.151
IT IS THE GOVERNMENT PAYS

07:41:52.217 --> 07:41:53.919
EVERYWHERE THERE'S NO EQUITY IN

07:41:53.986 --> 07:41:55.854
THE I THINK ABOUT THAT SO WILL

07:41:55.921 --> 07:41:58.991
SEEING IT'S BEEN TOO LONG. WE

07:41:59.058 --> 07:42:00.626
GOT A CHANGE THAT. IT'S

07:42:00.692 --> 07:42:02.494
EXCELLENT IT'S TOUGH TO HAVE

07:42:02.561 --> 07:42:04.296
DISCUSSION ON RACE. IS TOUGH

07:42:04.363 --> 07:42:05.264
KNOWN IT MAKES PEOPLE

07:42:05.330 --> 07:42:07.032
UNCOMFORTABLE OR TALK ABOUT IT.

07:42:07.099 --> 07:42:08.867
I CAN'T CHANGE COLOR OF MY SKIN

07:42:08.934 --> 07:42:11.136
I'M A BLACK MAN. BUT IT IS

07:42:11.203 --> 07:42:12.838
SOMETHING FOR THE VOTERS. TO GO

07:42:12.905 --> 07:42:14.540
VOTE SO I DON'T KNOW WHY.

07:42:14.606 --> 07:42:15.908
ANYBODY WOULD BEGRUDGE THE

07:42:15.974 --> 07:42:17.609
VOTERS TO MAKE A DECISION. THE

07:42:17.676 --> 07:42:18.777
VOTE ON THIS TWENTY FIVE YEARS

07:42:18.844 --> 07:42:21.713
AGO LET THEM VOTE ON IT NOW. IT

07:42:21.780 --> 07:42:23.015
IS NOT A BIG DEAL JUST MAKES

07:42:23.082 --> 07:42:25.484
SENSE. AND I REALLY BELIEVE. WE

07:42:25.551 --> 07:42:29.188
ARE AT A WATERMARK IN SOCIETY

07:42:29.254 --> 07:42:30.622
WITH THIS THERE'S SO MUCH

07:42:30.689 --> 07:42:31.890
THAT'S GOING ON. IN TO JUST

07:42:31.957 --> 07:42:34.259
BEING GATES IN OF ALL. PLACES

THIS. THE CASE. IT'S ABOUT

07:50:23.929 --> 07:50:25.430
POWER IT'S ABOUT FEARS ABOUT

07:50:25.497 --> 07:50:27.899
RACE ABOUT THE LOSS OF POWER

07:50:27.966 --> 07:50:29.267
AGE WAS ROUNDER'S PARTICULAR

07:50:29.334 --> 07:50:30.769
THE CHINESE COMMUNITY FEAR THE

07:50:30.835 --> 07:50:32.404
LOSS OF GOOD HARD WORKING

07:50:32.470 --> 07:50:35.574
PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU

07:50:35.640 --> 07:50:38.443
DO THE HARD WORK AS YOUR TOLD.

07:50:38.510 --> 07:50:39.010
THEY WILL HAVE THE CHANCE AS

07:50:39.077 --> 07:50:42.547
WELL TO. MANY OF THEM GOING TO

07:50:42.614 --> 07:50:45.183
DEBT BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF

07:50:45.250 --> 07:50:45.750
EDUCATION THAT'S A CULTURAL

07:50:45.817 --> 07:50:49.854
THING. SO IF WE UNDERSTAND. THE

07:50:49.921 --> 07:50:52.557
REALITIES NO ASIAN BECAUSE OF

07:50:52.624 --> 07:50:55.493
UNDER CAUCUS SUPPORT OUR AS

07:50:55.560 --> 07:50:57.262
AUTHORS CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL

07:50:57.329 --> 07:50:58.263
THE CLOCK IS MISSING AND WE'VE

07:50:58.330 --> 07:51:00.065
SEEN WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE EIGHT

07:51:00.131 --> 07:51:01.933
YEARS AGO NOTHING HAS CHANGED

07:51:02.000 --> 07:51:03.268
IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSATIONS

07:51:03.335 --> 07:51:04.903
THE DIFFICULTY OF THE

07:51:04.970 --> 07:51:07.038
CONVERSATIONS. SO WHY IS THAT

07:51:07.105 --> 07:51:08.139
THE CASE THAT SO MANY BELIEVE

07:51:08.206 --> 07:51:11.209
THIS. MANY IN THE COMMUNITY ARE

07:51:11.276 --> 07:51:13.211
RECENT IMMIGRANTS. THEY DON'T

07:51:13.278 --> 07:51:16.548
UNDERSTAND. THEY DON'T SEND THE

07:51:16.615 --> 07:51:18.383
CHALLENGES OF OTHER COMMUNITIES

07:51:18.450 --> 07:51:19.384
THAT'S WHY BY THE WAY WE NEED

07:51:19.451 --> 07:51:20.819
MANDATORY ETHNIC STUDIES SO WE

07:51:20.885 --> 07:51:22.220
CAN LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY OF

ALL OF US AS A CULTURE SO YOU

07:51:24.322 --> 07:51:28.026

07:51:28.093 --> 07:51:32.063
WITH THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT

THAT REALLY LED TO MY

07:53:05.123 --> 07:53:06.991
POLITICAL. AWAKENING TODAY I

07:53:07.058 --> 07:53:09.160
THOUGHT BOTH WERE BAD IDEAS AND

07:53:09.227 --> 07:53:11.796
I THINK- I STILL THINK BOTH ARE

07:53:11.863 --> 07:53:14.399
BAD IDEAS. TODAY THANKS TO THE

07:53:14.466 --> 07:53:16.868
AUTHOR WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

07:53:16.935 --> 07:53:18.670
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ONE OF

07:53:18.737 --> 07:53:21.873
THOSE TWO VERY BAD IDEAS. AND

07:53:21.940 --> 07:53:24.576
TODAY IS BEYOND TIME TO DO

07:53:24.642 --> 07:53:27.178
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. REALITY IS

07:53:27.245 --> 07:53:29.147
FINALLY CATCHING UP WITH THOSE

07:53:29.214 --> 07:53:30.215
WHO HOLDING GRAIN

07:53:30.281 --> 07:53:33.184
MISCONCEPTIONS OF RACE AND

07:53:33.251 --> 07:53:35.687
GENDER RELATIONS. WE KNOW NOW

07:53:35.754 --> 07:53:37.922
THAT SAYING WE ARE RACE COLOR

07:53:37.989 --> 07:53:40.658
BLIND IS THE SAME AS SAYING WE

07:53:40.725 --> 07:53:42.994
ARE BLIND TO HISTORY. THE SAME

07:53:43.061 --> 07:53:44.763
WAY THAT SO MANY HAVE BEEN

07:53:44.829 --> 07:53:47.465
BLIND TO POLICE BRUTALITY. TO

07:53:47.532 --> 07:53:49.067
SAY THAT FEMINISM MEANS

07:53:49.134 --> 07:53:51.803
TREATING WOMEN EXACTLY THE SAME

07:53:51.870 --> 07:53:54.906
AS MEN. IS THE DENIAL OF THE

07:53:54.973 --> 07:53:58.409
LONG TIME AFFECTS. A TURKEY. WE

07:53:58.476 --> 07:54:00.812
CAN LEARN FROM THE PAST. AND WE

07:54:00.879 --> 07:54:03.648
MUST KEEP LEARNING. EACH OF US

07:54:03.715 --> 07:54:05.717
CAME INTO THIS WORLD WITH THE

07:54:05.784 --> 07:54:08.086
SAME INTRINSIC VALUE. BUT

07:54:08.153 --> 07:54:10.054
SOCIAL NORMS AN IMPLICIT BIAS

07:54:10.121 --> 07:54:12.157
HAVE TIPPED THE SCALES AGAINST

07:54:12.223 --> 07:54:14.325
US AND WE HAVE SEEN RESEARCH

07:54:14.392 --> 07:54:16.728
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN

07:54:16.795 --> 07:54:19.697
THAT BEARS THIS OUT. WE MUST

07:54:19.764 --> 07:54:21.633
ALLOW FOR SOLUTIONS. THAT

07:54:21.699 --> 07:54:24.068
PROVIDE A COUNTERBALANCE TO

07:54:24.135 --> 07:54:26.938
UNFAIR ADVANTAGES. WE CAN BE

07:54:27.005 --> 07:54:31.209
FAIR. WE CAN DIGEST WE CAN MOVE

07:54:31.276 --> 07:54:34.445
FORWARD. BUT PROPOSITION TWO OH

07:54:34.512 --> 07:54:38.116
NINE STANDS IN OUR WAY. I ASK

07:54:38.183 --> 07:54:41.286
YOUR RIVALS RACY ACA FIVE.

07:54:41.352 --> 07:54:43.755
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

07:54:43.822 --> 07:54:48.593
DOCTOR WEBER. YOU MAY CLOSE.

07:54:48.660 --> 07:54:50.395
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND

07:54:50.461 --> 07:54:52.497
THANKS TO SO MANY OF YOU WHO

07:54:52.564 --> 07:54:55.600
HAVE STOOD IN SPOKEN TODAY AND-

07:54:55.667 --> 07:54:58.703
HAVE EXPRESSED YOUR CONCERN OF

07:54:58.770 --> 07:55:00.772
YOUR INTERESTS THE IN THIS. WE

07:55:00.839 --> 07:55:01.973
BEGIN BY FIRST OF ALL SAYING

07:55:02.040 --> 07:55:04.409
THAT IT WAS NOT MY DESIRE TO BE

07:55:04.475 --> 07:55:07.178
THE PRIMARY AUTHOR ON A CA FIVE.

07:55:07.245 --> 07:55:11.583
OF IT WAS A GROUP THING AND I

07:55:11.649 --> 07:55:13.384
HOPE THAT SOMEONE ELSE WOULD

07:55:13.451 --> 07:55:15.286
BASICALLY LEAD THE CHARGE

07:55:15.353 --> 07:55:16.855
BECAUSE I WOULD WAS EXHAUSTED

07:55:16.921 --> 07:55:19.757
FROM LAST YEAR FROM THREE NINE

07:55:19.824 --> 07:55:21.092
TWO AND SO I DIDN'T VOLUNTEER

07:55:21.159 --> 07:55:22.360
TO CHEER THIS IT WAS A GROUP

07:55:22.427 --> 07:55:23.828
THING THAT WE MET WITH

07:55:23.895 --> 07:55:25.897
COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS

07:55:25.964 --> 07:55:27.365
AND SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER PEOPLE

07:55:27.432 --> 07:55:29.734
JUST ASSUMED THAT I WAS THE

07:55:29.801 --> 07:55:32.003
MAIN AUTHOR. AND AS A RESULT MY

07:55:32.070 --> 07:55:34.606
NAME COMES FIRST EVEN ONE LAST

07:55:34.672 --> 07:55:36.441
IN THE ALPHABET. WITH REGARD TO

07:55:36.507 --> 07:55:39.510
THIS. SO FOR WHATEVER REASON A

07:55:39.577 --> 07:55:41.112
IT WAS NOT MY INTENT TO DO THAT.

07:55:41.179 --> 07:55:42.881
I WHEN I BEGAN MY PRESENTATION

07:55:42.947 --> 07:55:44.515
TODAY I WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE

07:55:44.582 --> 07:55:46.718
TO MANY OF YOU. BECAUSE YOU

07:55:46.784 --> 07:55:48.353
KNOW MY STRATEGY GENERALLY IS

07:55:48.419 --> 07:55:50.555
TO TALK TO PEOPLE. TO TRY TO

07:55:50.622 --> 07:55:51.489
GET TO YOU TO GET TO YOUR

07:55:51.556 --> 07:55:53.791
OFFICE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A

07:55:53.858 --> 07:55:55.059
CONVERSATION WITH YOU. AND A

07:55:55.126 --> 07:55:56.794
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YOU I WAS

07:55:56.861 --> 07:55:58.763
NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. MAINLY

07:55:58.830 --> 07:56:00.632
BECAUSE WE WERE QUARANTINED AND

07:56:00.698 --> 07:56:02.133
WE WERE HERE AND WE WERE THERE

07:56:02.200 --> 07:56:04.535
AND TIME WAS RUNNING OUT AND SO

07:56:04.602 --> 07:56:05.837
WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT

07:56:05.904 --> 07:56:07.972
OF TIME. AND I HAD TO RELY UPON

07:56:08.039 --> 07:56:09.874
OTHERS TO DO SOME OF THE

07:56:09.941 --> 07:56:12.210
CONVERSATION FOR ME. THE API

07:56:12.277 --> 07:56:13.645
COMMUNITY CHOSE THE CAUCUS

07:56:13.711 --> 07:56:15.013
CHOSE TO DO ITS OWN

07:56:15.079 --> 07:56:16.714
CONVERSATION WITH ITS MEMBERS.

07:56:16.781 --> 07:56:17.849
AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T

07:56:17.916 --> 07:56:19.751
NECESSARILY HEAR FROM ME. BUT

07:56:19.817 --> 07:56:20.852
YOUR OWN MEMBERS CHOSE TO DO

07:56:20.919 --> 07:56:22.420
THAT. AND THE SAME IS TRUE WITH

07:56:22.487 --> 07:56:23.855
THE LATINO CAUCUS. BECAUSE

07:56:23.922 --> 07:56:25.156
THERE WERE ALL THESE CAUCUSES

07:56:25.223 --> 07:56:25.990
IN EACH ONE HAD A

07:56:26.057 --> 07:56:28.192
RESPONSIBILITY TO GET ENGAGE

07:56:28.259 --> 07:56:30.061
WITH THEIR PERSONS. AND COME

07:56:30.128 --> 07:56:30.929
BACK TO ME AND TELL ME WHERE

07:56:30.995 --> 07:56:33.131
THEY WORK. THE LAST I HEARD WAS

07:56:33.197 --> 07:56:34.198
I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A

07:56:34.265 --> 07:56:36.234
MEETING ORGANIZED WITH YOU. THE

07:56:36.301 --> 07:56:37.969
MISTER GIBSON I BELIEVE IT WAS.

07:56:38.036 --> 07:56:39.604
AND SOME OTHERS AND SO IT WAS

07:56:39.671 --> 07:56:41.439
NOT THAT I WAS IGNORING YOU IS

07:56:41.506 --> 07:56:42.907
THAT WE HAD A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

07:56:42.974 --> 07:56:44.676
TIME COMING BACK. AND SO VERY

07:56:44.742 --> 07:56:45.843
FEW OF YOU I HAD REALLY A

07:56:45.910 --> 07:56:47.645
CHANCE TO REACH OUT TO. AND I

07:56:47.712 --> 07:56:49.380
GOT THE INFORMATION FROM OTHERS

07:56:49.447 --> 07:56:51.049
AND EVENTUALLY. GOT FOUND OUT

07:56:51.115 --> 07:56:52.417
WHERE PEOPLE WERE WITH REGARD

07:56:52.483 --> 07:56:54.218
TO SOMEONE APOLOGIZE AS I WAS

07:56:54.285 --> 07:56:56.020
GOING TO BECAUSE- MY STRATEGY

07:56:56.087 --> 07:56:57.355
HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO MEET IF YOU

07:56:57.422 --> 07:56:59.490
INDIVIDUALLY. AND SO THAT WAS

07:56:59.557 --> 07:57:01.359
THEN BEING TOLD WHO POTENTIALLY

07:57:01.426 --> 07:57:02.927
I NEEDED TO CALL. BECAUSE WE

07:57:02.994 --> 07:57:04.762
WERE RUNNING TIME AND NOT

07:57:04.829 --> 07:57:06.464
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO IGNORE

07:57:06.531 --> 07:57:07.799
ANYONE BUT I WAS GETTING

07:57:07.865 --> 07:57:10.335
INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS

07:57:10.401 --> 07:57:13.104
SOURCES. I SEE FOR DOES SOME OF

07:57:13.171 --> 07:57:14.672
YOU I DIDN'T REACH OUT TO. BUT

07:57:14.739 --> 07:57:15.540
WHEN YOU'VE GOT GET FIFTY FOUR.

07:57:15.606 --> 07:57:17.175
AND YOU A VERY LIMITED OF TIME

07:57:17.241 --> 07:57:18.943
WE HAVE TO MAXIMIZE. WHAT

07:57:19.010 --> 07:57:20.044
YOU'RE DOING I HAD MUCH MORE

07:57:20.111 --> 07:57:22.914
TIME WITH THREE NINE TWO. NINE

07:57:22.981 --> 07:57:23.448
THREE ONE COMBINED AND ALL

07:57:23.514 --> 07:57:25.049
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. SO LET

07:57:25.116 --> 07:57:26.818
ME THAT USE THAT SAY THAT THIS

07:57:26.884 --> 07:57:28.553
WAS NOT MY INTENT TO DO THIS.

07:57:28.619 --> 07:57:29.487
AND ONE OF THE REASONS OTHER

07:57:29.554 --> 07:57:31.422
REASON IS BECAUSE- IT IS VERY

07:57:31.489 --> 07:57:35.026
DIFFICULT. TO TALK ABOUT RACE.

07:57:35.093 --> 07:57:36.127
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE A

07:57:36.194 --> 07:57:37.829
PERSON WHO SEES IT EVERYWHERE

07:57:37.895 --> 07:57:39.831
IT'S VERY HARD NOT TO SAY THERE

07:57:39.897 --> 07:57:40.598
IS THERE IS THERE IS THERE IT

07:57:40.665 --> 07:57:42.500
IS BECAUSE THEN YOU BECOME THE

07:57:42.567 --> 07:57:43.434
PERSON WHO'S ALWAYS SO BREAKS

07:57:43.501 --> 07:57:45.203
CONSCIOUS. PEOPLE START

07:57:45.269 --> 07:57:47.271
AVOIDING YOU DISLIKING YOU SO I

07:57:47.338 --> 07:57:48.639
TRY TO SAVE MY RACE

07:57:48.706 --> 07:57:50.375
CONVERSATIONS FOR THE REAL BIG

07:57:50.441 --> 07:57:52.510
RACE ISSUES. NOT THE LITTLE

07:57:52.577 --> 07:57:54.479
ONES BECAUSE IF YOU DO THE

07:57:54.545 --> 07:57:56.681
OTHER YOU'RE OVER PEOPLE BEGIN

07:57:56.748 --> 07:57:58.182
TO AVOID YOU. AND THEN YOU

07:57:58.249 --> 07:57:59.617
BECOME INEFFECTIVE AND YOUR

07:57:59.684 --> 07:58:01.019
ABILITY TO TEACH THEM ABOUT THE

07:58:01.085 --> 07:58:03.321
BIG THINGS AND SO I TRY NOT TO

07:58:03.388 --> 07:58:05.490
BECAUSE OF THAT AND I TRIED NOT

07:58:05.556 --> 07:58:06.024
TO ALSO BECAUSE IT'S VERY

07:58:06.090 --> 07:58:08.559
PAINFUL FOR ME. A PERSON WHO'S

07:58:08.626 --> 07:58:09.727
LIVED AS LONG AS I'VE LIVED.

07:58:09.794 --> 07:58:12.196
I'M SEVENTY ONE I'LL BE SEVENTY

07:58:12.263 --> 07:58:13.031
TWO IN SEPTEMBER. HAS LIVED AS

07:58:13.097 --> 07:58:15.166
LONG AS I LIVE. HAS SEEN SO

07:58:15.233 --> 07:58:19.537
MUCH TRY SO HARD TRY TO HELP

07:58:19.604 --> 07:58:21.439
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL

07:58:21.506 --> 07:58:23.174
WHAT I SEE IN MY CHILDREN AND

07:58:23.241 --> 07:58:25.176
MY COMMUNITY WHAT I SEE MY

07:58:25.243 --> 07:58:27.311
RELATIVES HOW I SEE THE HURT

07:58:27.378 --> 07:58:28.546
AND THE PAIN THAT THEY FEEL IN

07:58:28.613 --> 07:58:29.781
THE DISCRIMINATION THAT THEY'RE

07:58:29.847 --> 07:58:31.749
INVOLVED WITH. AND SOME PEOPLE

07:58:31.816 --> 07:58:32.583
THINK WELL YOU'VE GOT IT ALL

07:58:32.650 --> 07:58:34.252
SURELY YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE

07:58:34.318 --> 07:58:36.087
CAREER YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW A

07:58:36.154 --> 07:58:37.688
SUCCESSFUL LIFE YOU'VE GOT THE

07:58:37.755 --> 07:58:38.456
BIG HOUSE YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE

07:58:38.523 --> 07:58:40.558
THINGS BUT I STILL HAVE FAMILY

07:58:40.625 --> 07:58:41.559
MEMBERS THAT I STILL HAVE

07:58:41.626 --> 07:58:43.394
NEIGHBORS I SEE SICK CHILDREN

07:58:43.461 --> 07:58:44.829
AND I STILL WOULDN'T SCHOOLS

07:58:44.896 --> 07:58:46.497
WHAT I SEE THAT THERE THE

07:58:46.564 --> 07:58:49.634
FUTURE IS BLOCKED. AND I KNOW

07:58:49.700 --> 07:58:52.703
THAT BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD

07:58:52.770 --> 07:58:54.739
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ME.

07:58:54.806 --> 07:58:56.541
BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S IT BECAUSE

07:58:56.607 --> 07:58:58.743
THAT'S WHAT IT IS IN TERMS OF

07:58:58.810 --> 07:58:59.444
THE FAMILY THE RELATIVES THAT

07:58:59.510 --> 07:59:01.479
YOU SEE. AND SO WHEN I HEAR

07:59:01.546 --> 07:59:03.247
PEOPLE SAY YEAH I KNOW IT'S

07:59:03.314 --> 07:59:04.549
THERE BUT I WANT TO DO THIS AND

07:59:04.615 --> 07:59:05.183
I WANT TO DO THAT I WANT TO DO

07:59:05.249 --> 07:59:08.019
IS I WANTED ALL THOSE THINGS TO.

07:59:08.086 --> 07:59:09.554
AND YES WE MUST SARCHIE TO A

07:59:09.620 --> 07:59:11.322
PROBLEM. WE MUST SO THAT'S WHY

07:59:11.389 --> 07:59:12.790
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE

07:59:12.857 --> 07:59:14.792
SAW THAT PROBLEM. BUT I'VE ALSO

07:59:14.859 --> 07:59:15.660
LEARNED THAT IN THE PROCESS OF

07:59:15.726 --> 07:59:17.762
THE STRUGGLE. BUT I CAN'T JUST

07:59:17.829 --> 07:59:19.530
DO K. TWELVE. BECAUSE INTO THE

07:59:19.597 --> 07:59:21.499
GENERATION UP YOU THIS I'M ALSO

07:59:21.566 --> 07:59:23.267
LOSING. AS I'VE GOT TO HELP

07:59:23.334 --> 07:59:24.802
THEM AS WELL. AND I'VE GOT TO

07:59:24.869 --> 07:59:25.937
HELP PEOPLE GET INTO THAT AND

07:59:26.003 --> 07:59:27.038
I'VE ALSO GOT TO HELP PEOPLE

07:59:27.105 --> 07:59:28.506
GET CONTRACTS BECAUSE- I SEE

07:59:28.573 --> 07:59:30.208
THE VISION. BEING KILLED IN THE

07:59:30.274 --> 07:59:31.442
EYES OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY

07:59:31.509 --> 07:59:32.844
CAN'T GET THESE CONTRACTS OF

07:59:32.910 --> 07:59:35.146
THESE JOBS. I SEE THE FACT THAT

07:59:35.213 --> 07:59:36.347
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH- KIDS OF

07:59:36.414 --> 07:59:37.248
COLOR NOW IN A PRINT YOUR

07:59:37.315 --> 07:59:40.351
PROGRAM. SO WHEN I GO ON WORK

07:59:40.418 --> 07:59:41.886
SITES I SEE. ALMOST VERY FEW.

07:59:41.953 --> 07:59:47.158
AFRICAN A- ITS OWN. LETTING TO

07:59:47.225 --> 07:59:47.758
PRINT YOUR PROGRAM. WITH THERE

07:59:47.825 --> 07:59:48.893
IS NO. OF REACH THEM TO. INTO

07:59:48.960 --> 07:59:50.962
THE- IN SO WE HAVE CONSTRUCTION

07:59:51.028 --> 07:59:51.929
A THIS THE PEOPLE CALL ME THE

07:59:51.996 --> 07:59:54.232
CAP SAYS NO AFTER AMERICAN BILL

07:59:54.298 --> 07:59:56.367
THAT BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET.

07:59:56.434 --> 07:59:57.101
AND WE HAD TO GO TO THE

07:59:57.168 --> 07:59:58.703
GOVERNOR AND WE HAVE NO PROGRAM

07:59:58.769 --> 08:00:00.304
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS

08:00:00.371 --> 08:00:00.872
OF THIS DIVERSITY ON A WORK

08:00:00.938 --> 08:00:03.174
SITE. AND SO EVENTUALLY WILL

08:00:03.241 --> 08:00:04.809
REALIZE AHA THERE'S NO AFRICAN

08:00:04.876 --> 08:00:06.444
AMERICAN SO THAT WHEN FOUND

08:00:06.511 --> 08:00:07.512
THREE OF THEM WHO ARE. WELL

08:00:07.578 --> 08:00:10.148
QUALIFIED TO DO IRON WORK ON ON

08:00:10.214 --> 08:00:11.182
THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET.

08:00:11.249 --> 08:00:12.517
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I SEE

08:00:12.583 --> 08:00:15.219
IN A DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN. BUT

08:00:15.286 --> 08:00:16.587
I DO KNOW THAT WHEN I WORKED

08:00:16.654 --> 08:00:19.457
UNDER NEATH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

08:00:19.524 --> 08:00:20.458
AND I SPENT THOSE YEARS AT THE

08:00:20.525 --> 08:00:22.059
UNIVERSITY I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

08:00:22.126 --> 08:00:24.462
TO HELP PEOPLE. I KNOW THAT MY

08:00:24.529 --> 08:00:26.531
PROFESSOR HELPED ME THAT HAD HE

08:00:26.597 --> 08:00:28.499
NOT BEEN ON THE CAMPUS OF UCLA

08:00:28.566 --> 08:00:30.101
I WOULD NEVER BEEN A WHICH WILL

08:00:30.168 --> 08:00:32.770
SOON FOLLOW. I WOULD HAVE NEVER

08:00:32.837 --> 08:00:34.005
GONE TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. AS IT

08:00:34.071 --> 08:00:34.906
WOULD TOO MANY OTHER PEOPLE

08:00:34.972 --> 08:00:36.207
PULLING ME AWAY BUT HE WAS

08:00:36.274 --> 08:00:38.042
THERE AS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

08:00:38.109 --> 08:00:40.578
ON CAMPUS TO HELP US. NAVIGATE

08:00:40.645 --> 08:00:42.079
HE DIDN'T TAKE MY TEST HE COULD

08:00:42.146 --> 08:00:42.880
WRITE MY DISSERTATION HE

08:00:42.947 --> 08:00:44.315
COULDN'T DO THOSE THINGS BUT HE

08:00:44.382 --> 08:00:46.817
COULD ENCOURAGE ME TO CONTINUE

08:00:46.884 --> 08:00:48.019
TO MOVE FORWARD. HE COULD BE A

08:00:48.085 --> 08:00:50.254
ROLE MODEL FOR ME IF YOU COULD

08:00:50.321 --> 08:00:51.122
LIFT ME UP WHEN TIMES ARE

08:00:51.189 --> 08:00:53.124
DIFFICULT AS THEY TRIED TO PUT

08:00:53.191 --> 08:00:53.791
ME OUT OF SCHOOL. AND YET I

08:00:53.858 --> 08:00:55.293
HAVE A HIGH GPA IN THE

08:00:55.359 --> 08:00:57.728
DEPARTMENT GRADUATED EARLY THAN

08:00:57.795 --> 08:00:58.863
ANYBODY ELSE. AND YET THE

08:00:58.930 --> 08:01:00.598
RACISM OF THE WHITE MALE. PART

08:01:00.665 --> 08:01:02.500
AND WANTED TO DESTROY ME AND

08:01:02.567 --> 08:01:03.401
THEY MADE EVERY EFFORT TO TRY

08:01:03.467 --> 08:01:05.436
TO DO IT. AND WHAT NOT FOR THIS

08:01:05.503 --> 08:01:06.404
THIS GENTLEMAN WHO WAS A

08:01:06.470 --> 08:01:09.073
SCHOLAR. AND A ROLE MODEL FOR

08:01:09.140 --> 08:01:10.775
ME THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THAT.

08:01:10.841 --> 08:01:12.343
AND SO I HAD A COMMITMENT WHEN

08:01:12.410 --> 08:01:13.844
I BEGAN TO TEACH THAT I HAD TO

08:01:13.911 --> 08:01:15.413
OPEN THESE DOORS EVERY YOUNG

08:01:15.479 --> 08:01:17.548
PERSON I EVER SAW. TO MAKE SURE

08:01:17.615 --> 08:01:19.450
OF THAT. NOT ONLY AFRICAN

08:01:19.517 --> 08:01:20.651
AMERICAN STUDENTS BUT I BELIEVE

08:01:20.718 --> 08:01:21.686
THE WHITE STUDENTS WHO CAME

08:01:21.752 --> 08:01:23.921
INTO MY CLASS A BETTER PEOPLE

08:01:23.988 --> 08:01:24.755
RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE

08:01:24.822 --> 08:01:25.723
DIVERSITY THAT WAS IN THAT

08:01:25.790 --> 08:01:27.992
CLASSROOM. THEY HAVE FRIENDS IT

08:01:28.059 --> 08:01:29.427
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THEM THAT WE

08:01:29.493 --> 08:01:30.194
COULD CHALLENGE SIMILAR FOUGHT

08:01:30.261 --> 08:01:31.862
TO MAKE AN CHALLENGE US. AND

08:01:31.929 --> 08:01:33.998
THEY GREW FROM SIMPLY BEING IN

08:01:34.065 --> 08:01:35.066
THE MIDST OF THEM AND IT MADE

08:01:35.132 --> 08:01:37.134
CALIFORNIA IT MADE A UNIVERSAL

08:01:37.201 --> 08:01:38.336
MAKE CALIFORNIA A BETTER PLACE

08:01:38.402 --> 08:01:39.904
FOR PEOPLE TO BE. SO WHEN WE

08:01:39.971 --> 08:01:41.973
START TALKING ABOUT THIS IS

08:01:42.039 --> 08:01:43.941
EVERYTHING. IT IS NOT JUST

08:01:44.008 --> 08:01:45.843
GETTING IN THE UNIVERSITY. IT'S

08:01:45.910 --> 08:01:47.778
HAVING SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHY YOU

08:01:47.845 --> 08:01:48.946
BETTER KEEP YOU THERE. IS

08:01:49.013 --> 08:01:50.414
COMMITTING A STANDARD YOU

MY THIS. BUT YOU KNOW I ALSO

08:02:09.100 --> 08:02:10.935
DID I TELL ALL MY- THAT THEY

OPPORTUNITY. A UNIQUE

08:02:54.745 --> 08:02:56.113
OPPORTUNITY. AND I WAS SO

THAT. SO THAT WAS ONE

08:03:02.286 --> 08:03:03.554
CONVERSATION THAT I DIDN'T HAVE

08:03:03.621 --> 08:03:05.056
TO HAVE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. WE

08:03:05.122 --> 08:03:07.058
HAVE TO ADMIT IT IS REAL. AND

08:03:07.124 --> 08:03:08.526
IT IS THERE THAT IS PRESENT AND

08:03:08.592 --> 08:03:10.094

OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WITH

08:03:11.262 --> 08:03:13.564
EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND

08:03:13.631 --> 08:03:14.932
AS A LEGISLATURE WE HAVE A

08:03:14.999 --> 08:03:16.400
RESPONSIBILITY TO FIGURE OUT

08:03:16.467 --> 08:03:18.235
EVERY WAY THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN

08:03:18.302 --> 08:03:19.770
TO IMPACT THAT AND IT WOULD NOT

08:03:19.837 --> 08:03:21.839

REMOVING TOLD I WILL NOT SOLVE

08:03:23.207 --> 08:03:25.476
ALL THE PROBLEMS. BUT IT'S ONE

08:03:25.543 --> 08:03:26.610
OF THE MANY TOOLS THAT WE HAVE

08:03:26.677 --> 08:03:28.279
