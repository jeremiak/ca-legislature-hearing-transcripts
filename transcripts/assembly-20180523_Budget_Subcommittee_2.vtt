ADMISSION GROWTH AND WE HAVE A

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:51.752
LOT OF STUDENTS AT THE

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:53.487
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHOSE

01:34:53.554 --> 01:34:53.954
NEEDS.

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:57.425
ARE SUCH AND THAT WE NEED TO

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:59.360
CONTINUE TO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF

01:34:59.427 --> 01:35:01.295
NOT JUST PROVIDING SPOTS BUT

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.764
ALSO A QUALITY EDUCATION.

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:05.699
AND I THINK THAT WE ARE GETTING

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:07.835
THERE I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA.

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:10.137
IS WORKING HARD AT THIS IS A

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.472
GOOD YEAR.

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.040
IT MAY NOT BE A GOOD HERE IN THE

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:15.509
FUTURE SO I GO BACK TO WHAT'S

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:17.244
BEEN SAID IN PRIOR COMMITTEES.

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:19.380
ABOUT THE NEED TO THINK TO HAVE

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:20.548
A LONG TERM VISION AND

01:35:20.614 --> 01:35:22.283
UNDERSTAND THAT WE MAY NOT BE

01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:24.018
ABLE AS A STATE TO MAKE THIS

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:26.087
LEVEL OF INVESTMENT EVERY SINGLE

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:27.788
YEAR. AND WE WILL HAVE.

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:28.622
HERE.

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:30.091
AND SO I HOPE THAT THIS

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:30.958
INVESTMENT.

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:33.527
THIS YEAR ID INVESTMENTS WE'VE

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:34.795
MADE IN THE PAST AND THE

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.130
COMMITMENT TO TRY TO.

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:37.665
INSURE WORK.

01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:39.700

FOR PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:44.738
.

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:47.074
AND IS TRYING TO DO BETTER ABOUT

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:48.209
MEETING THE NEEDS OF CURRENT

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:50.744

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:52.413
WHEN. I'M IN A HALF I HATE TO

SAY BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES AND.

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:56.617
CALIFORNIA'S I FISCAL OUTLOOK

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:58.752
IS IS A DIFFERENT REALITY THAT

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:03.757
WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW.

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:06.527
JEFF JARVIS.

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:07.261
YOU I KNOW THERE'S A LOT A

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:09.563
STATEMENT CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:10.631
ECONOMY IS DOING WELL IN THAT

01:36:10.698 --> 01:36:11.565
THERE'S GOING TO BE ECONOMY

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:12.633
SHIFT IN THE FUTURE.

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.002
AND.

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:16.437
BUT. I WON'T BE HERE BUT A

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:17.705
CAUTION I WOULD SAY IS THAT

01:36:17.771 --> 01:36:19.707
WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:20.941
EDUCATION. AND THE PAST SIX

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:23.110
YEARS.

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:24.612
WHEN BUDGETS ARE SET OF

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:26.480
PRIORITIES.

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:28.983
AND I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND.

01:36:29.049 --> 01:36:30.551
EVEN IN A HARD TIME COMING IN

01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.353
THE FUTURE WE NEED TO CONTINUE

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:34.488
TO INVEST. IN EDUCATION BECAUSE

01:36:34.555 --> 01:36:35.890
WE ALL KNOW THAT EVERY STUDY

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.459
SHOWS THAT. INVESTMENT EDUCATION

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:40.294
RETURNS A FIVER SEVEN FOLD

01:36:40.361 --> 01:36:42.897
RETURN IN THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE.

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:44.064
MAKE MONEY AND HIGHER QUALITY

01:36:44.131 --> 01:36:45.366
OF LIFE.

01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:47.635
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE DO.

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.670
ACROSS THE BUDGET.

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:52.106
MET.

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:53.207
THE VAST MAJORITY IN ON HER

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.942
DON'T HAVE THAT RETURN.

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:57.778
SAU JUST ASK YOU TO. CONTINUE TO

01:36:57.845 --> 01:37:00.814
INVEST IN EARLY CHILD EDUCATION

01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:02.183
KATIE TWELVE CHANGES.

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:03.651
OUR CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; OUR COMMUNITY&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:05.819
COLLEGES BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:07.221
WAY WE'RE GONNA GROW THE ECONOMY

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:08.956

IN THE FUTURE WE DON'T BACK DOWN

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:18.032
ON EDUCATION I WOULD SAY GO
