MUCH APPRECIATED THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE BILL TODAY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I HAVE WORKED ON FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN FACT THE CAME AYE I'D ISSUE MUCH MORE RECENTLY TO THE- ACTIVITIES AND ACTIONS THAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT. BUT THERE ARE MANY WHO HAD A LEAD IN THIS AREA OF CARE FOR MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS- THAT NO ONE MORE THAN THE CHAIR- WHO IS WORK ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY MANY YEARS HERE HUESO YOU HAVE BEEN A LEADER IN THE SPACE YOU HAVE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT MEDICALLY VULNERABLE- CUSTOMERS ARE NOT DISCONNECTED BECAUSE THE FAILURE TO PAY. YEAH YOU HAVE WORKED- TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. HAS HAS A AT REQUIRED THAT- THAT NEEDS SAID TODAY THAT ARE WE ARE OF THOSE IN THEIR CUSTOMER AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN. YOUR MEDICAL. SO I APPLAUD LEADERSHIP IN THIS BY AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY. AND MORE RECENT THIS PAST YEAR. I SENATOR DODD HAS ALSO BEEN A GREAT LEADER AND- WORK WITH MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS IT WAS HIS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR. THAT REQUIRE THAT UTILITIES CREATE A PROTOCOL. FOR HOW WE DEAL WITH MEDICALLY. BASELINE CUSTOMERS AND I APPLAUD SENATOR DIED. AND HIS LEADERSHIP. LET ME SAY AT THE ONSET. THE STAFF OF YOUR COMMITTEE HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH THEY WORK WITH ME AND MY STAFF. I IN THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU ANY AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT. TODAY BUT I WANT TO APPLAUD AT THEIR THEIR HEALTH AND OF THAT AND APPRECIATION FOR. ALL THAT THEY HAVE DONE AND OF COURSE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY JOB AUTHOR ON THIS LEGISLATION. BY SENATOR MCGUIRE WHO HAS WORKED WITH ME ON THIS AND MANY OTHER ISSUES IN THIS SPACE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. PROPOSING THAT THE AMENDMENTS WHICH I ACCEPT. SB EIGHT OH ONE WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. AS WE ENTER THIS YEAR'S WILDFIRE SEASON. AS AMENDED THIS BILL WHY ARE UTILITIES PROVIDE BACKUP POWER SOURCES OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT. FOR THE PURCHASE OF BACKUP POWER SOURCES THE MEDICAL BASS LINE CUSTOMERS RELYING ON LIFE SUPPORTING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. IN HIGH FIRE ZONES AND- THERE ARE MANY WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND A SISTERLY WHAT IS A MEDICALLY BUT AS A MEDICAL BASS LINE CUSTOMER LET ME. PULL FROM THE REGULATIONS AT LEAST AND GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE- THAT REQUIRE POWER THAT REQUIRE THE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT REQUIRE BREATHING MACHINES DIALYSIS MACHINES. IRON LUNGS OXYGEN GENERATORS MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIRS. TOTAL ARTIFICIAL HEART. WHO NEED AIRWAY CLEARANCE SYSTEMS QUADRIPLEGIC CONDITIONS. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO OF LIFE THREATENING ILLNESSES OR COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEMS. AND THEY REQUIRE SPECIAL HEATING OR COOLING TO SUSTAIN LIFE AND AVOIDED MEDICAL RATIONS. DURING THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF ADVANCED OF OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OVER TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS DEALT WITH. LOSING THEIR POWER IN FORTY COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THESE EVENTS WERE ESPECIALLY THREATENING FOR A MEDICALLY VULNERABLE CONSTITUENTS WHOSE LIVES AS I DESCRIBED DEPEND ON ELECTRICITY TO POWER THEIR MEDICAL DEVICES. MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND MEDICALLY MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS WERE AFFECTED BY THAT THESE PAST POWER OUTAGES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. AND AS WILDFIRES AND PS PS EVENTS INCREASE. MORE MEDICALLY VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS WILL BE AT RISK OF LOSING POWER TWO DEVICES THAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE. SOME OF OUR UTILITIES HAVE WORKED THROUGH NONPROFIT OR OTHER AVENUES TO PROVIDE SOME BACKUP POWER. TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. AND I APPLAUD THEM FOR THAT. BUT THERE VOLUNTARY MEASURES HAVE NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. AB SB EIGHT OH ONE WILL MAKE SURE THAT MEDICALLY FRAGILE CALIFORNIANS. ARE NOT AT INCREASED RISK DURING PS PS OFFENSE. BY REQUIRING THAT PUBLIC UTILITIES PROVIDE THEM WITH BACKUP POWER RESOURCES FOR THEIR LIFE SUSTAINING EQUIPMENT. THESE ARE A QUOTE REQUIREMENTS WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THOSE WITHIN HIGH FIRE ZONES AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT FINANCIALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN BACK UP POWER EQUIPMENT. WE MUST NOT LEAVE ARE VULNERABLE IN THE DARK IT'S OUR DUTY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED DURING THESE PS PS EVENTS. WITH V.

SB ELEVEN SEVENTEEN ELIMINATES A STATUTORY CONFLICT IN EXISTING LAW TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO RESIDENTS SUCH AS MOBILE HOME APARTMENT RESIDENTS BY ENSURING RATES CHART. MR RIGHT THROUGH TO METERS BASED ON THE LIKE PROVIDERS ACTUAL RESIDENTS RATE. CURRENTLY ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS AND OTHER THIRD PARTY BILLERS ARE CHARGING SET METER ACCOUNT SET THE ELECTRIC CORPORATION RATE FOR ELECTRICITY EVEN IF THE AREA IS SERVED BY A COMMUNITY CHOI AT THE GATE. WITH THE CURRENT RATE THIS IS OCCURRING SPECIFICALLY IN MOBILE HOME PARKS THIS RESULTS IN PARK RESIDENTS BEING DENIED SAVINGS ARE BENEFITS FROM THE CCA ENABLES MOBILE HOME PARK OPERATORS. GET THE SAVINGS YOU THEY ALREADY NJOY A DIFFERENT SHOW PROFIT OVER AND ABOVE WHAT THEY'RE CHARGED AT THE MASTER METER. THE SEARCH I HAVE BEEN.

TO BILL AND SEVEN THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE THE SEPTIC DID THIS BILL IS AT THE HEART OF THAT. PROBLEM HERE IS THAT RECENT YEARS WE- DO PUT OUT OUT OF THIRD PARTY LOW DISTURBING ENTITIES. TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC GENERATION WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF DISTURBING YOU KILL IT. AT THE AGGREGATE OR ENTITIES CAN DELIVER ENERGY AT LOWER RATES. ARE CO OWNERS AS RESULT GET ON REGULATED DISCOUNTS UP THE ENERGY IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT ON. TO THE RESIDENTS. HI IT IN IT.

TODAY THANK YOU HERE SENATE BILL IN THE BILL DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. JUST CURIOUS MISTER CHAIR BY COULD ASK. ONE QUESTION IN LIGHT OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THIS- IT ALMOST SEEMS AS- ALMOST A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF OUR STATE ONE OUT OF FIVE WILL BE LOW. INCOME OR NO INCOME. HOW WILL THAT IMPACT. RATES ON THE REST OF. THE BILL IS WRITTEN RATE NEUTRAL IT HAS NO LANGUAGE- GIVEN ANY AUTHORITY TO THE PC TO INCREASE RATES TO. BROADEN THE PROGRAM WE ARE SIMPLY. AND IN ELIGIBILITY TO MAKE EXISTING FUNDS ELIGIBLE FOR- THESE PROGRAMS SO THERE THERE HAS BEEN- A SURPLUS OF FUNDS IN THIS PROGRAM FOR MANY YEARS AND- BECAUSE OF. THE INCOME- ADJUSTMENT HASN'T BEEN MADE IN FIFTEEN YEARS THERE'S LESS STRONG ON THESE FUNDS WHEN WE REALLY NEED THESE FUNDS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SO WHEN THEY SPEAK OF THIS BILL CAUSING PRESSURE. I DON'T KNOW THAT- IT'S ANY MORE PRESSURE THAN ALREADY EXISTS ON THE PC TO DO ANYTHING IN THIS WRITTEN IN THIS. HI A UNIVERSE FROM THIS AREA- I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS BILL INCREASES PRESSURE IT IT'S SIMPLY ALLOWS MORE PEOPLE TO QUALIFY- BUT THERE IS NO PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR RATES INCREASE I TOOK THIS ON- THE THIS BILL ON WHAT THE- THE SOLE CONDITION THAT IT WOULD NOT RESULT. IN A RATE INCREASE BUT I DO SEE THE NEED TO GET THIS MONEY INTO OUR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY NOW. WHEN WE HAVE A ECONOMIC CRISIS SITUATION OUR STATE AND SOME OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS NOW- FACING OUR STATE AND ITS HISTORY- GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO TRANSFERRING THAT WORK IN A SAVINGS REPAIRS IS GOING TO BE. SO IN THIS PROCESS. I WOULD TO TELL THE OPPOSITE JIM THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO INCREASE RATES THERE'S NO PROVISION IN IT THAT WOULD INCREASE RATES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T EVEN. PROVIDE DIRECTION TO INCREASE RATES SHOULD THE VINCENT SHOULD THE FUNDS- GO DOWN- SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO THE IT'S NOT WRITTEN IN THE BILL SO- I DON'T THINK AND I HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T RESULT. IN AN INCREASE RATES EVEN IF THE- OF THE PC THREATS PLENARY. PLANNER THIRTY DECIDE TO DO THEIR ON THEIR OWN REGARD I DON'T. NECESSARILY THINK THEY WOULD BUT- IF THEY DO IT WOULDN'T BE A RESULT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER HUESO WOULD THAT BE YOUR CLOSING STATEMENT.
