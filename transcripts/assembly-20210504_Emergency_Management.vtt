00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.929
LATER VACCINE I WORKED WORKED

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:12.864
VERY CLOSELY WITH. ALL THE

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:14.366
LAWSUIT IS COUNTY BOARD OF

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:19.571
COUNTERPART OF BARBER FOR RARE

FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WITHIN. OUR

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:22.273
PUBLIC HEALTH TEAM I THINK THAT

WE OVERALL DID WELL AS THE

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:26.911
INCIDENT AND I'LL I WILL

CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS. SAVE SOME

00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:31.950
OF. THE QUESTIONS THAT OTHER

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:41.393
PEOPLE SPEAK. BUT AS ANY-

00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:43.061

LESSONS IN TO WOULD BE FINE AND

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.602
I THINK. WALKING FROM

00:27:50.668 --> 00:27:51.836
ACCOUNTING EXPERTS WITH COUNTY

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:54.873
AGENTS. AS WE HAD STONE WE WERE

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:55.874
TO. RESOLVE THOSE TALENTS AND

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.778
EXPERTISE MANNER- YEAH BEEN

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:00.345
SOME INSTANCES THAT I REALLY

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:02.080
APPRECIATE T. THE EX OF FOR

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:04.849
THE STATE. BUT I THINK THAT IN

00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:08.219
SOME INSTANCES FROM- YES OF M.

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:10.722
SORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I WE

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:11.556
COULD COLLABORATE A LITTLE BIT

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:13.958
BETTER- EDUCATION TO

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.694
COMMUNICATIONS BOB AS WE

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:19.297
SOMETIMES SAY IT'S AN EMERGENCY

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.899
INCIDENTS THAT ALL PARTIES ARE

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:23.401
LOCAL AND THEN HE SPED OUT TO

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:25.637
THE STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.272
FOR ASSISTANCE AND I THINK

00:28:27.338 --> 00:28:29.140
THEY'RE IN SOME AREAS ALTHOUGH

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:32.043

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:59.370
CHALLENGE GET. OF RAMPARTS BUT

00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:00.672
SINCE I KNEW THAT LIVES WERE AT

A SUBSTANTIAL FARMWORKER

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.341
POPULATION WHO ARE PRIMARILY

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:40.144
LATINO. WE SURVEYED FARM

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:41.646
BUSINESSES REGARDING HOW MANY

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:43.714
EMPLOYEES WANTED VACCINES AND

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:45.249
THEN SCHEDULED THESE EMPLOYEES

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:47.351
INTO VACCINE CLINICS HELD ON

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:49.787
THE FARMS THEMSELVES. THANKS TO

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:52.390
THESE EFFORTS WE ESTIMATE THAT

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:54.025
83% OF FARMWORKERS AND YOLO

00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:56.027
COUNTY HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST

00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:59.664
ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. YET

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.632
DESPITE THESE CONCERTED EFFORTS

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.267

VACCINE IN EQUITY IS PERSISTENT

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:08.072

SLICE THE DATA CERTAIN GROUPS

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:12.043
HAVE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:14.011
VACCINATED PERSONS THAN OTHERS.

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:14.712
THE DISPARITIES ARE

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:17.615
PARTICULARLY VISIBLE BY

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:19.417
ETHNICITY AND BY ZIP CODE. YOLO

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:21.319
COUNTY'S MOST DISADVANTAGED

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:22.720
APPROACH I'VE MEASURED BY THE

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:26.090
HEALTHY PLACES INDEX IS NINE

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:26.591

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:38.336
FIVE HAVE BEEN VACCINATED.

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:40.137
BECAUSE OF THIS GAP ARE

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:41.873
MULTIFACTORIAL AND INCLUDE

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:52.517
WE HAVE RESPONDED FOR THE

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:54.118
DISPARITIES BY HOLDING VACCINE

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:57.188

LIVE AND WORK AND THE ZIP CODE.

00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:01.659
WE PARTNER WITH MULTIPLE

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:03.461
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:04.629

ENCOURAGE VACCINATION. ONE

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.652
LESSON LEARNED FROM OUR EFFORTS

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:29.720
IN WEST SACRAMENTO IS THAT WE

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:30.788
ARE NOT BUILDING A FIELD OF

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:33.457

00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:35.860
YOU BUILD IT A. K. A. VACCINE.

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:38.062
THEY WILL COME. ACCESS TO

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:40.431
VACCINE IS JUST ONE PIECE OF A

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:44.001
COMPLEX PUZZLE. AN ADDITIONAL

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:45.803
FORM OF VACCINE IN EQUITY IN

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.838
YOLO COUNTY IS UNDER

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:49.974

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.176
MARTINO'S COMPRISE 32% OF

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:00.685
THIS DISPARITY IS DUE AT LEAST

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:03.287
IN PART TO POOR DATA. ACCORDING

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:05.256
TO THE STATE'S BAXEEN DASHBOARD

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:07.692

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:24.408

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:26.777
ONLY 6% OF THOSE VACCINATED ARE

00:37:26.844 --> 00:37:28.579

THE 15% REPORTED AS UNKNOWN BY

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:33.284
THE STATE. INCREASING THE

PROPORTION OF LATINO VACCINIA

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:37.855
IS FROM 18% TO TWENTY ONE

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:40.458
PERCENT. WHILE IMPROVED WE

00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:44.195
STILL FALL SHORT OF THE 32%

LATINO POPULATION PROPORTION.

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:48.199

ENCOURAGE VACCINATION AMONG

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:56.374
LATINOS. WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.342
MAKE VACCINES MORE CONVENIENT

00:37:58.409 --> 00:37:59.844
RECOGNIZING THAT SOME PEOPLE

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.412
MAY NOT GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.147
BE VACCINATED BUT THEY WON'T

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:04.815
TURN DOWN A VACCINE THAT LANDS

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:06.784
IN THEIR LAPS. IN THE COMING

00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:08.653
WEEKS WILL BE OFFERING VACCINE

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:10.688
AT CATHOLIC CHURCHES LATINO

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:13.024

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.829
WORK AND ON WEEKENDS. I REMAIN

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:20.031
CRITICAL OF STATE LEVEL

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:22.033
APPROACHES TO IMPROVE TIMELY

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:24.368
ACCESS TO VACCINES PARTICULARLY

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:27.805
MY TURN AT THE T. PA NETWORK.

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.707
BOTH WERE WELL INTENTIONED BUT

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:31.542
THEY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE TOO

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:33.377
LATE TO SOLVE FOR WHICH THEY

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:35.746
WERE CREATED. THIS ISN'T

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:38.015
NECESSARILY ANYONE'S FAULT. IT

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:39.450
SIMPLY DIFFICULT FOR LARGE

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.619
ENTITIES TO PIVOT AS SITUATIONS

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:44.321
CHANGE WHEREAS SMALLER ENTITIES

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:47.224
CAN BE MORE NIMBLE. FOR EXAMPLE

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.759
BY THE TIME MY TURN WAS

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:50.094
TECHNICALLY ABLE TO LIMIT

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:51.662
REGISTRATIONS BY COUNTY OF

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.531
RESIDENCE AND STATE POLICY

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:55.733
ENABLED SUCH GEO FENCING IN

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.635
ORDER TO RESTRICT VACCINE FOR

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.704
ISLAM MANY COUNTIES USING MY

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.539
TURN HAD SEEN A DECREASE AND

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:03.441
DEMANDS. THEY ENDED UP USING

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.209
THE GEO FENCING FEATURE FOR

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:08.412
ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:10.281
OPENING VACCINES TO ALL. THE

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:12.183
VACCINE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA

00:39:12.249 --> 00:39:14.018
COUNTIES CHANGES QUICKLY AND

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.853
LARGE STATEWIDE SYSTEMS JUST

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.621
CAN'T KEEP UP AS WE MOVE FROM

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:19.957
VACCINE SCARCITY TO VACCINE

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.859
HESITANCY WITHIN JUST A FEW

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:25.096

00:39:34.805 --> 00:39:36.173

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.042
EXPAND YOLO COUNTY VACCINATION

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:40.344

00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:45.316

INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT LEVEL.

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:21.190
RIGHT AND WHAT MONTH WAS THAT

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:23.292
INCIPIENT LEVEL. WAS AT LAST

THE CHAIN WITH- BASKET SUPPLY

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.746
IN GALA. SO DOES ESTIMATES WAS

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:45.214
MORE OF LAST YEAR WHEN WE BEGAN

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:46.515
TO MAKE INTEL WERE ABLE TO IT

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:50.920
BACK OVER TO THE. MY HOTEL IS I

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:51.621
AM THAT PART FOCUS I THE

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:52.455
VACCINE PART OF THIS. WHEN A

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:54.156

SO THE DEFINITION PROCESS. ONLY.

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:07.169
I'M TRYING TO THINK AMERICA

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:09.305
NATIONALLY WE WERE INVOLVED IN

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.774
THE VACCINES ARM WHEN THERE WAS

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:12.975
A CHALLENGE OF SETTING UP MAKE

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:15.244
MEGA SCIENCE ROBAXIN UNTIL IT

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.913
FINALLY CITY SET UP THE FIRST

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.614
THIRTY SIX THE COUNTY OF LOS

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:20.516
ANGELES AND THEN WHENEVER THE

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.918
DAY WELL IT'S THERE ARE WE

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:26.222
TRANSITION FROM. VACCINES TO

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:29.325
MAKE PROTESTING THE VACCINES

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:30.926
THAT'S WHEN WE BEGAN TO CLEAR

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:32.561
BUT SINCE I DON'T HAVE ACCURATE

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:34.864
DATA PUT IT RIGHT NOW OKAY

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.133
VACCINES BECAME AVAILABLE WE

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:38.234
WERE INVOLVED IN THAT MISSION

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:39.935
RIGHT I AND OKAY SO IT IT

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:41.937
BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF MY

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:45.808
QUESTION OR MY CONCERN IS THAT

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:47.843
THEY DIDN'T ENGAGE THE PEOPLE

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.045
WHO KNOW HOW TO DO LOGISTICS

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.913
PASSED SOON ENOUGH IN THIS

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.149
PROCESS WHICH IS WHEN THEY KNOW

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:53.983
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:56.385
VACCINES ON THE HORIZON AS LATE

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:59.021
R. AS EARLY AS LAST JULY.

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.156
THAT'S WHEN THAT PLANNING

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:04.293
PROCESS STARTS AND SO I YOU

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.661
KNOW WHEN YOU TRY TO DO LIKE

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:07.363
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THIS WHEN YOU

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:08.864
TRY TO DO LOGISTICS IN THE

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:10.366
MIDDLE OF A FIRE EIGHT IT'S

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:12.702
PRETTY HECTIC AT THE BEGINNING-

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:13.869
IT'S BETTER IF WE HAVEN'T DONE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.838
WAY AHEAD OF TIME SO THAT THAT

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.239
HELPS ME UNDERSTAND THAT ISSUE

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:19.408
A LITTLE BIT- SECOND QUESTION I

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:20.710

COSTS JUST FOR L. A. COUNTY

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:43.432
ALONE- SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:44.934
THAT NUMBER IS BECAUSE WE NEED

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.268
TO KNOW WHAT ALLOCATIONS ARE

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.804

OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS IT

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.160

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.611
SERVERS. SO IF THEY'RE RELATED

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:31.680
TO. THE INVESTIGATION MY

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:33.482

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:37.052
ONE THOUSAND GOING TO BE

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:40.289
UNABLE. TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:42.458

DATE TO GET VACCINATED. THERE

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:49.611
IS IT'S EITHER  LACK OF ACCESS

WAS TOLD WELL IT'S KIND A

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:02.791
LITTLE OF BOTH I UNDERSTAND

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:03.792

IT'S EIGHTY TWENTY OR SO WHAT

01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:08.630
IS THE BIGGEST. THE BIGGEST

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.266
OBSTACLE TO GETTING THOSE

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:14.302
COMMUNITIES THERE DISADVANTAGED.

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:16.938
THE VACCINATION IS IT A LACK OF

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:19.841
WILLINGNESS OR LACK OF ACCESS.

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:20.408
WE COULD START WITH G. BONTA

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:28.016
BEYOND THAT. OKAY THINK AYE

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.389
THE RELATES TO VACCINATIONS

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:36.024
BUT- I'LL GIVE YOU MY

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:40.629
PERSPECTIVE- FIRST. THIS IS THE

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:43.598
LACK OF ACCESS. ARM I THINK

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.267
THERE WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:48.036
COMMUNITY AND IN OUR COUNTY.

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:51.439
THAT WAS CHALLENGE. PRIOR TO

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:53.842
THE PANDEMIC IT'S A PLACE TO

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:56.845
ACCESS FOR HEALTHCARE OR OTHER

01:21:56.911 --> 01:22:00.148
SERVICES. OUR THAT WAS THE

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:04.286
SITUATION. PREDATED COVERT

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:06.588
NINETEEN AND SO WHAT COOPER

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.556
NINETEEN OF HER. THERE'S THAT

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.025
CHANGED OTHER THAN THE FACT

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.593
THAT WE HAVE HOPE NINETEENTH OF

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.194
THE MOST ST COMMUNITIES THAT

STRUGGLED FOR- HEALTH CARE

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:18.366
ACCESS. OR PARTICLE ANYTHING

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:21.202

IT'S STRUGGLING NOW. AND THAT'S

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:26.174
THE SUM A LARGE. ARM STRATEGIC

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:27.309
APPROACH TO HOW WE ADDRESS

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:31.279
THAT- MOVING FORWARDS- SILVA

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:34.349
REYES TO VACCINES NOW I THINK

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:40.754
COURSE WE ALSO WANT TO

01:47:40.821 --> 01:47:42.989
PRIORITIZE UP FOCUSING ON THE

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:46.426
HIGHEST IMPACT COMMUNITIES. THE

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:48.361
WAY THAT WE HAVE FOCUS ARE

01:47:48.428 --> 01:47:50.530
FAXING PROGRAMS HAS BEEN WITH

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:53.500
THREE KEY PRINCIPLES SAFETY.

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:57.571
EQUITY AND TRANSPARENCY. SO I

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:58.905
HAD MENTIONED THAT THE H. B. I.

01:47:58.972 --> 01:48:00.607
COURT DATES BACK QUARTILES HAVE

01:48:00.674 --> 01:48:02.242
BEEN HAVE BEEN USE CONSISTENTLY

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:03.376
WE USE THAT DURING OUR OUR

01:48:03.443 --> 01:48:05.612
BLUEPRINT TO INCENTIVIZE TO

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:07.781
INCENTIVIZE TESTING AND GETTING

01:48:07.848 --> 01:48:09.883
FOCUSED ON THE LOWER INCOME

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:11.718
COMMUNITIES AND THEN WE USE

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:13.486
THAT FOR A VACCINE EQUITY MET

01:48:13.553 --> 01:48:17.190
UP AT METRIC WHICH IS ZIP CODE

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:18.892
BATES THE REASON WHY WE USE THE

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:20.660
ZIP CODES BASED MASSIVE METHOD

01:48:20.727 --> 01:48:22.095
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

01:48:22.162 --> 01:48:23.363
WHERE THE CENSUS TRACK IS THAT

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:24.397
NOT EVERYBODY WILL GIVE YOU

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:26.700
THEIR ADDRESS BUT PEOPLE ARE

01:48:26.766 --> 01:48:27.601
USUALLY WILLING TO GIVE YOU THE

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:40.614
ZIP CODE. SO THERE WAS. A

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.214
QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT HOW DO

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:41.781
WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW IT- IF

01:48:41.848 --> 01:48:42.382
SOMEBODY- YOUR ACCOUNT BEEN

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:43.850
BACK. AND SO THAT THAT'S A THAT

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:45.218
WAS AN IMPORTANT ARE TERM OF

01:48:45.285 --> 01:48:45.852
OUR DAY STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE

01:48:45.919 --> 01:48:47.220
THAT WE USE THE ZIP CODE BASIS

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:48.355
THAT WILL ALL SEACM K. RATE BY

01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:50.423
THE DIFF TACK. BUT ALSO A LOT

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:52.125
TOWN SAN DIEGO WHO IN THEIR

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:57.163
ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACROSS THIS.

01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:57.797
THE OTHER POINT THINK ABOUT OUR

01:48:57.864 --> 01:49:00.467
FAX. THIS WAS. BOB ARE PER.

01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:02.269
STRATEGY AND WE DO IT HAVE IT

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:03.503
DURING THE HIGH. SEARCH WHEN

01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:04.671
THE HIGH. WITH THE HIGHEST

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:05.972
SEARCH FOR HAPPENING LET ME FOR

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:06.573
OF ALL SIR SAYING THAT WE KNOW

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.108
THE- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THOSE

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:10.310
THAT MOST AND- PUTTING THOSE.

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:11.978
WERE OF WITH THE GROUP WAS MOST

01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:13.380
IMPACT MEDINA REPRESENT THIRTY

01:49:13.446 --> 01:49:15.315
NINE. OF THE POP. IN CALIFORNIA

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:17.684
THEY REPRESENTED 60% OF THE

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:21.488
CASES. AND 46% OF THE DEATH.

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:23.924
80% OF THE DEATHS OCCURRED IN

01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:26.059
PAID PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE.

01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:28.295
THAT MEANS THAT. THE IN THE HOT

01:49:28.361 --> 01:49:29.963
IN THE HOSPITAL DURING THE

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:31.564
SEARCH THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:49:31.631 --> 01:49:33.266
MOSTLY IMPACTED WHO WERE IN THE

01:49:33.333 --> 01:49:35.001
HOSPITAL I SEE YOU. AND WE'RE

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:40.307
DYING. WERE PEOPLE OF PEOPLE OF.

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:41.207
COLOR PRIMARILY LATINO. AND

01:49:41.274 --> 01:49:42.008
WE'RE REAL IS THAT WE NEED TO

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:44.311
SHOW TO IN A BASED. BECAUSE WE

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:45.679
HAD TO WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:49:45.745 --> 01:49:48.281
THIRD STRATEGY THAT WAS SIMPLE

01:49:48.348 --> 01:49:49.549
TO IMPLEMENT AND THAT COULD BE

01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:51.618
IMPLEMENTED WITH SPEED THE IDEA

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:53.920
WAS IS THAT. BURGO WE KNOW

01:49:53.987 --> 01:49:56.156
THAT. THE OLDER OLDER FOLKS ARE

01:49:56.222 --> 01:49:57.257
THE ONES THERE AND THEN UP IN

01:49:57.324 --> 01:49:58.892
THE HOSPITAL AND DYING AS OUR

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:00.493
FAXING STRATEGY HOW TO PAY THAT

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.262
BY PRIORITIZING. BY

01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:04.564
PRIORITIZING AGE THEN WE

01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:06.232
PRIORITIZE MEDICAL CONDITIONS

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:07.400
AND THEN PERSONS WITH

01:50:07.467 --> 01:50:08.735
DISABILITY AND THE LAST

01:50:08.802 --> 01:50:09.903
IMPORTANT PILLAR OF THE

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.905
STRATEGY IS THE CONCENTRATOR

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:13.873
OUT REACH AN ALLOCATION AND OUR

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.076
EFFORTS. IN THE LOWER INCOME

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:17.877
COMMUNITIES QUARTILES ONE INTO

01:50:17.944 --> 01:50:20.413
SO THE COMBINATION OF AGE

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.381
MEDICAL CONDITION DISABILITY

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:22.983
AND THEN. AND THEN-

01:50:23.049 --> 01:50:27.187
CONCENTRATING IN. THE AREAS

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:27.854
THAT ARE THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED.

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:28.955
SO WHEN YOU THE- OVERALL

01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:30.156
OVERALL STRATEGY THERE WERE

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:32.559
THERE WERE FIVE MAJOR AIR FIVE

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:35.061
MAJOR AREAS THAT- THAT. THE

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:36.529
WHAT'S CALLED THE THAT BOTH THE

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:38.098
STATE AND THE T. PAY THE THIRD

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:39.332
PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FOCUSED ON

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:41.134
WAS ALLOCATIONS OF 40% THE

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:43.303
VACCINES. THAT INITIALLY GOING

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:44.838
TO THE H. P. I. ONE QUARTILE

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:47.507
THE- THAT THE LOWEST INCOME.

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:49.609
DEVELOPING A NETWORK OF

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:51.211
PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND

01:50:51.277 --> 01:50:52.479
I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR

01:50:52.545 --> 01:50:55.348
DOCTOR- AMY SISKIND WHO

01:50:55.415 --> 01:50:57.784
MENTIONED THE I. YAHOO BENCHES-

01:50:57.851 --> 01:50:59.452
THE VFC PROGRAM FOR CHILDHOOD

01:50:59.519 --> 01:51:01.554
VACCINATIONS. AND THAT THAT

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:03.256
PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:05.125
WITHOUT NEEDING TO BE ENROLLED

01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:06.960
IN THE T. PH. D.'S VACCINE

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:09.529
PROVIDERS ALREADY KNOW HOW TO

01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:10.797
FAXING TO VACCINATE CHILDREN.

01:51:10.864 --> 01:51:12.499
HAVE AS ITS AS THE CHILDHOOD

01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:13.800
VACCINES BECOME AVAILABLE

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:15.435
THEY'RE ALREADY IN PLACE

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:16.770
THEY'RE ALREADY CONNECTED TO

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:18.938
OUR IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY. DATA

01:51:19.005 --> 01:51:20.140
WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE ALL THE

01:51:20.206 --> 01:51:21.274
SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:22.842
SURE THAT THE DATE THAT WE GET

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:24.711
AS MANY KIDS VACCINATED. AS

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:29.916
FAST AS POSSIBLE. THIRTY AREAS

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:30.583
WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS.

01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:32.285
THE AREA IS WITH IS WITH DATA.

01:51:32.352 --> 01:51:34.220
AND DATA WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:35.789
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE.

01:51:35.855 --> 01:51:37.557
HISTORICALLY WE EVEN THOUGH WE

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:39.325
HAVE GOT A VACCINE REGISTRY FOR

01:51:39.392 --> 01:51:41.628
MANY YEARS IT WAS NOT AT THE

01:51:41.694 --> 01:51:44.998
LEVEL OF. PREPAREDNESS THAT

01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:46.566
WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR US TO

01:51:46.633 --> 01:51:48.501
REALLY HAVE THE QUALITY OF DATA

01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:49.502
SO THAT WE CAN REALLY TRACK

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:52.739
METRICS. I KNOW EXACTLY WHO'S

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:54.074
GETTING VACCINATED WHERE THEY

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.109
LIVE AND COLLECTING SUFFICIENT

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:57.844
DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SO THAT

01:51:57.911 --> 01:51:59.212
WE CAN ACTUALLY WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:01.347
FOCUS ON EQUITY. SO THAT WE CAN

01:52:01.414 --> 01:52:02.582
LOOK AT THE DISPARITIES I

01:52:02.649 --> 01:52:04.117
MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER ARE

01:52:04.184 --> 01:52:05.552
POSSIBLE WE COULD SEE THE

01:52:05.618 --> 01:52:06.686
DISPARITIES BECAUSE OF A QUOTE

01:52:06.753 --> 01:52:08.421
THE QUOTE DATA. QUALITY

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:10.190
IMPROVED AND OF ALL SEVERAL

01:52:10.256 --> 01:52:11.724
STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEMS

01:52:11.791 --> 01:52:12.859
INCLUDING OUR IMMUNIZATION

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:15.061
REGISTRY OUR INVENTORY SYSTEM

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:17.497
CALL CA FAX MY TURN THAT HAD A

01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:19.432
COMPONENT WHERE ANYBODY CAN LOG

01:52:19.499 --> 01:52:22.135
IN INTO MY TURN REGISTER- AND

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:23.002
GET AN APPOINTMENT AS WELL AS

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:24.871
MY TURN CLINIC SO. PEOPLE COULD

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:27.173
RUN A CLINIC. A TURN THAT DATA

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.675
WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH

01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:30.677
RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:52:30.743 --> 01:52:32.412
OF CALIFORNIA AT STANFORD. WHO

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:34.047
TOOK ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE WE

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:35.748
KNEW ABOUT THE VIRUS ALTHOUGH

01:52:35.815 --> 01:52:36.816
WE KNEW ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.351
AND HELPED US TO DEVELOP A

01:52:38.418 --> 01:52:40.587
STRATEGY. OF HOW WE CAN END

01:52:40.653 --> 01:52:42.322
THIS PANDEMIC AS FAST AS

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:44.324
POSSIBLE AND THE FASTEST WAY OF

01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:45.425
ENDING THIS PANDEMIC IS BY

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:47.060
FOCUSING ON THE MOST IMPACTED

01:52:47.127 --> 01:52:48.595
COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHERE

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:50.530
TRANSMISSIONS HAPPENING MOST BY

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:52.065
AND THAT'S THE THAT THE FASTEST

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:53.600
ROUTE INCIDENT THAT THE THOUGHT

01:52:53.666 --> 01:52:54.834
LEADING WITH SCIENCE WE CAN

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:57.504
TELL THE WHOLE STATE HOPE. THAT

01:52:57.570 --> 01:52:57.971
BY FOCUSING ON THESE

01:52:58.037 --> 01:53:00.874
COMMUNITIES EVERYBODY BENEFITS.

01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:03.376
PUBLIC EDUCATION WE HAVE

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:05.011
VACCINATE ALL FIFTY A CAMPAIGN

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:06.746
DURING A TREMENDOUS FORMATIVE

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:09.716
RESEARCH- FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF

01:53:09.782 --> 01:53:11.284
THE THINGS THAT- OUR

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:13.253
RESEARCHERS FOUND IN LOOKING AT

01:53:13.319 --> 01:53:14.387
PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:15.522
GETTING VACCINATED WHEN YOU

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:17.123
LOOK AT LATINOS WITH A YEAR.

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:19.425
SPANISH DOMINANT FOR BILINGUAL

01:53:19.492 --> 01:53:21.995
FLASH ENGLISH IT TURNS OUT THAT

01:53:22.061 --> 01:53:23.930
LATINOS THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:25.765
THEM ARE WILLING TO GET

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:31.538
VACCINATED. SO REALLY. IT IS

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:32.739
PRIMARILY AN ISSUE OF ACCESS.

01:53:32.805 --> 01:53:35.775
OPPOSITE ISSUE OF OUTREACH. OF

01:53:35.842 --> 01:53:37.076
AND THEN THE OTHER GROUP WHERE

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:38.978
THERE IS IT THERE IS THERE'S

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:40.146
LESS WILLINGNESS TO GET

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:41.281
VACCINATED AND THAT'S IN THE

01:53:41.347 --> 01:53:42.815
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SO

01:53:42.882 --> 01:53:44.651
THERE'S LIKE A CONTRAST THERE

01:53:44.717 --> 01:53:46.586
WERE WE HAVE TO DO MORE WORK TO

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:48.021
BUILD TRUST WITH THE AFRICAN

01:53:48.087 --> 01:53:49.889
AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WE'RE IT

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:50.957
WE'RE IMPLEMENTING A NEW

01:53:51.024 --> 01:53:52.492
VACCINE EQUITY PLAN THE RIGHT

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:54.127
NOW'S GONNA BE FOCUSING ON

01:53:54.194 --> 01:53:56.930
THIRTEEN COUNTIES. WHERE WE'RE

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:58.264
GONNA TRY TO GET TAT THE GOAL

01:53:58.331 --> 01:54:01.267
IS TO GET 75% COVERAGE OF IN

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:03.136
THE EIGHT IN THE QUARTILE ONE

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:04.304
THE LOWEST INCOME QUARTILE BY

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:06.573
JUNE FIFTEENTH A LOT OF WORK

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:09.442
AHEAD- THAT'S OUR GOAL LOOK

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:10.310
WE'RE GONNA SEE YOU EVER GONNA

01:54:10.376 --> 01:54:12.045
BE ABLE TO REACH IT A LOT OF

01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:13.813
WORK HAPPENING AROUND THAT. AND

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.248
AT THIS POINT IT'S REALLY ABOUT

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:17.350
GETTING HYPER LOCAL I'LL JUST

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:18.651
GIVING EXAMPLES OF TWO WEEKS

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:20.620
AGO I WENT TO VISIT IN THE

01:54:20.687 --> 01:54:22.789

46% OF THOSE AREAS HAVE BEEN

02:17:07.586 --> 02:17:09.187
VACCINATED BUT THEN AGAIN

02:17:09.254 --> 02:17:10.889
LOOKING AT THE COLOR CHART IT

02:17:10.956 --> 02:17:12.691
SEEMS LIKE IT'S A DIFFERENT

02:17:12.757 --> 02:17:13.892
BIKE THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE LIKE

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:15.961
IT'S 70% RYE BROOK C. THAT THE

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:17.529
COLOR CHANGES HAVE REALLY

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:19.364
CHANGED A LOT SO THAT REALLY

02:17:19.431 --> 02:17:21.166
HAS ME A LITTLE CONFUSED ON

02:17:21.232 --> 02:17:22.734
WHAT REALLY IS ARE THE

02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:24.669
PERCENTAGE BECAUSE I'M HEARING

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:25.303
ONE NUMBER BUT THAT I'M SEEING

02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:26.838
A COLOR CHART THAT LOOKS

02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:28.406
TOTALLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE

02:17:28.473 --> 02:17:29.074
OBVIOUSLY THOUGH THOSE

02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:30.809
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WERE

02:17:30.875 --> 02:17:31.509
THE HARDEST HIT WE CAN ALL

02:17:31.576 --> 02:17:33.712
AGREE. AND WE'RE DOING A LOT

02:17:33.778 --> 02:17:34.913
BETTER NOW BUT I'M JUST LOOKING

02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:36.481
FEES REGARDING THE COLOR CHART

02:17:36.548 --> 02:17:37.682
THE PERCENTAGE THAT'S ONE

02:17:37.749 --> 02:17:39.551
QUESTIONAND THE SECOND

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:42.253
QUESTION I JUST HAD IS

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:43.822
REGARDING- THE STATEWIDE PUBLIC

02:17:43.888 --> 02:17:45.123
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS REGARDING

02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:47.092
GREAT PLATES DELIVERED. AND

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.793
PROJECT ROOM KAY I'M JUST ON

02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:50.061
THAT NOTE JUST WANTED TO SEE IF

02:17:50.128 --> 02:17:51.830
THOSE. HAVE BEEN OF THOSE

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:53.231
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN

02:17:53.298 --> 02:17:55.033
EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE SO.

02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:57.435
WITHOUT ANYBODY CAN AFTER THOSE

02:17:57.502 --> 02:18:01.606
TWO. MAYBE THIS IS DOCTOR ERICA

02:18:01.673 --> 02:18:03.241
MAYBE I'LL TAKE THE FIRST ONE.

02:18:03.308 --> 02:18:05.443
SO IF YOU IF YOU GO TO THE

02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:07.479
GOVERNOR'S WEBSITE COVED

02:18:07.545 --> 02:18:09.447
NINETEEN DOT CA DOT GOV. AND

02:18:09.514 --> 02:18:10.515
THERE'S A LINK THERE THAT WILL

02:18:10.582 --> 02:18:12.350
TAKE YOU TO THE FACT THE BACK

02:18:12.417 --> 02:18:13.585
AT THE TOP OF THE RIGHT HAND

02:18:13.652 --> 02:18:15.420
SIDE THE TICKET A VACCINE. THE

02:18:15.487 --> 02:18:17.656
VACCINE DATA. AND IF YOU GO

02:18:17.722 --> 02:18:19.157
THERE YOU'LL YOU'LL GET TO SEE

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:21.426
THEM. THAT BREAK OUT WHERE I

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:22.661
GOT THAT THE THAT THE

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.663
STATISTICS NE OF THE THINGS

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:25.330
THAT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT

02:18:25.397 --> 02:18:26.598
CONFUSING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:18:26.665 --> 02:18:29.768
STATISTICS. IS THAT THERE'S TWO

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:31.636
MAJOR STATISTICS THAT THEY'LL

02:18:31.703 --> 02:18:34.372
GIVE YOU THEY WILL SAY. OF ALL

02:18:34.439 --> 02:18:35.874
THE VACCINES THAT WERE GIVEN

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.942
WHAT PROPORTIONS WENT INTO

02:18:38.009 --> 02:18:40.345
DIFFERENT QUARTILES THE H. BACK

02:18:40.412 --> 02:18:42.013
QUARTILES. SO THAT'S ONE TYPE

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:45.617
OF STATISTIC. ED- AND YOU'LL

02:18:45.684 --> 02:18:46.785
END IT THAT'S THERE FOR FROM

02:18:46.851 --> 02:18:48.086
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHAT

02:18:48.153 --> 02:18:49.754
I'M ABOUT TO SAY MAXES OUT WITH

02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:52.257
WITHIN A QUARTILE. WITHIN A

02:18:52.323 --> 02:18:54.159
QUARTILE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:58.763
ELIGIBLE. WHAT PROPORTION HAVE

02:18:58.830 --> 02:18:59.364
BEEN VACCINATED. A THAT GETS

02:18:59.431 --> 02:19:02.133
CONFUSING. BOTH BOTH OF THOSE

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.401
THE TWO THINGS ARE IMPORTANT

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:05.303
STATISTICS ONE GIVE AN IDEA OF

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:06.805
THE ALLOCATION AND THE OTHER

02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:07.772
ONE GIVES THE SECOND ONE GIVES

02:19:07.839 --> 02:19:09.407
YOU THE IDEA OF COVERAGE WITHIN

02:19:09.474 --> 02:19:11.476
A QUARTILE. AND THEY'RE BOTH

02:19:11.543 --> 02:19:12.811
IMPORTANT BUT THEY CAN BE VERY

02:19:12.877 --> 02:19:15.213
CONFUSING AND IT'S UP IF YOU

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:17.749
CAN BE A CHALLENGE. SO OFF FROM

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:20.652
THE FROM THE WEBSITE WHAT YOU

02:19:20.719 --> 02:19:24.122
WILL SEE IS. WITH VAN QUARTILE

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:25.890
ONE OF THE WITHIN QUARTILE ONE

02:19:25.957 --> 02:19:27.459
FOR VACCINE COVERAGE FOR

02:19:27.525 --> 02:19:29.928
VACCINE COVERAGE FORTY SEVEN

02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:32.397
POINT 1% HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST

02:19:32.464 --> 02:19:35.767
ONE DOES- WITH AGAIN WITH AND

02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:37.469
WITHIN THAT QUARTILE TWENTY

02:19:37.535 --> 02:19:39.037
NINE POINT 6% ARE FULLY

02:19:39.104 --> 02:19:41.306
VACCINATED. THAT MEANS THAT

02:19:41.372 --> 02:19:43.808
THERE'S 53% OF ELIGIBLE PEOPLE

02:19:43.875 --> 02:19:45.276
THE COURTHOUSE IN INDIO

02:19:45.343 --> 02:19:47.278
COURTHOUSE ACROSS THE STATE

02:19:47.345 --> 02:19:47.746
THAT STILL NEED TO BE

02:19:47.812 --> 02:19:50.048
VACCINATED. NOW WITHIN THE

02:19:50.115 --> 02:19:52.016
HIGHEST QUARTILE HIGH SINGLE

02:19:52.083 --> 02:19:54.919
QUARTET WHICH IS QUARTILE FOR.

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:57.122
71% HAVE RECEIVED SEVENTY ONE

02:19:57.188 --> 02:19:59.557
POINT 4% HAVE RECEIVED- AT

02:19:59.624 --> 02:20:02.961
LEAST ONE SOUTH. 47% OF THOSE

02:20:03.027 --> 02:20:05.029
ARE FULLY VACCINATED AND THAT

02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:06.598
MEANS THAT THERE'S A REMAINDER

02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:08.466
OF ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT POINT SIX

02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:10.335
PERCENT. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:20:10.402 --> 02:20:12.003
REAL DISPARITY THAT THAT'S

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:13.104
ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT A

02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:14.806
SEVERITY TO FOCUS ON AT THE END

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:15.573
OF THE DAY IS WHAT IS THE

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:17.609
COVERAGE. I MEAN THAT'S WHY

02:20:17.675 --> 02:20:18.943
THERE'S SUCH A BIG FOCUS ON

02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:20.779
QUARTILE ONE IS BECAUSE WE

02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:21.880
WANTED WE WANTED WE WOULD LIKE

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:25.116
IT TO BE AS HIGH AS QUARTILE

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:28.486
FOR THE HIGHER INCOME. TO ALL

02:20:28.553 --> 02:20:30.655
IN THERE THANK YOU. OKAY FIFTY

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:33.424
S. NOT AND SO THIS IS UP SMART

02:20:33.491 --> 02:20:36.227
DR ARE GONNA. ALWAYS HELPFUL- I

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:40.965
DON'T ALSO- SO I THINK DOCTOR

ABOUT THE LARGER NUMBERS BY

02:21:16.401 --> 02:21:17.368
COMPARISON TO SOME OF THESE

02:21:17.435 --> 02:21:20.238
TARGETED AREAS IN THE MISSION

02:21:20.305 --> 02:21:22.273
THAT. WE HAD- YOU'RE GONNA SEE

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.075
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT NUMBERS

02:21:24.142 --> 02:21:24.576
IT'S A IT'S A MUCH MORE

THAT THERE'S THAT THERE'S A

02:24:47.245 --> 02:24:48.146
VACCINE COVERAGE WHICH GIVES

02:24:48.212 --> 02:24:50.214
IMMUNITY. BUT THERE'S ALSO A

02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:51.449
PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION

02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:52.950
THAT HAD NATURAL INFRACTION

02:24:53.017 --> 02:24:55.620
INFECTION. SO THEY HAVE SOME OF

02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:56.954
THE MUNITY FROM THE NATURAL

02:24:57.021 --> 02:24:58.623
INFECTION SO WHEN YOU COMBINE

02:24:58.689 --> 02:25:01.025
ALL THAT UP- THE PROPORTION OF

02:25:01.092 --> 02:25:02.827
PEOPLE THAT HAVE- COMMUNITY

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:04.862

RIGHT DIRECTION AND THAT IT

02:25:09.834 --> 02:25:11.669
WILL BE A TRANSITION PERIOD. WE

02:25:11.736 --> 02:25:13.438
WANT THAT THE RATES TO CONTINUE

02:25:13.504 --> 02:25:15.306
TO BE AS LOW AS LOW AS POSSIBLE

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.607
BECAUSE THAT MAKES HIGHER RISK

02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:19.444
ACTIVITIES. A SAFER. I DURING

02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:20.645
THIS TRANSITION PERIOD WILL

02:25:20.711 --> 02:25:21.712

HAVE. WE GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:40.691

02:32:03.848 --> 02:32:05.349
YOU KNOW I. I REALLY THINK WE

02:32:05.416 --> 02:32:06.517
NEED TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO

02:32:06.584 --> 02:32:08.752
IMPROVE OUR NUMBERS- ON AN

02:32:08.819 --> 02:32:12.022
EQUITY BASIS OF REACHING ALL-

02:32:12.089 --> 02:32:13.691
DEMOGRAPHICS IN IN IN THE

02:32:13.757 --> 02:32:16.060
STATE- I WILL SAY I'M GREAT

02:32:16.126 --> 02:32:17.261
PLATES I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT

02:32:17.328 --> 02:32:19.296
OF FANFARE ABOUT IT. I CAN TELL

02:32:19.363 --> 02:32:20.764
YOU MY COMMUNITY WE DIDN'T SEE

02:32:20.831 --> 02:32:24.034
WE HARDLY SOUGHT- I DON'T KNOW

02:32:24.101 --> 02:32:25.803
OF ANY RESTAURANTS THAT TO TAKE

02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:29.807
ADVANTAGE OF THAT- SO I MEAN I.

02:32:29.874 --> 02:32:31.475
I SEE HOW WHERE MAYBE IT WORKED

02:32:31.542 --> 02:32:32.610
AND IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT I

02:32:32.676 --> 02:32:34.912
DON'T. I THINK THE COMMITTEE

02:32:34.979 --> 02:32:36.680
ASKED FOR DATE ON EVERY COUNTY.

02:32:36.747 --> 02:32:37.815
AND I DON'T THINK LEAST WE

02:32:37.882 --> 02:32:39.550
STILL HAVEN'T REALLY RECEIVED

02:32:39.617 --> 02:32:41.552
THAT INFORMTION ABOUT HEY HOW

02:32:41.619 --> 02:32:43.888
HOW BROADLY WAS THIS MADE IN.

02:32:43.954 --> 02:32:44.522
AND THAT'S BEEN JUST ONE OF THE

02:32:44.588 --> 02:32:46.724
PROBLEMS I THINK- IN DEALING

02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:47.458
WITH THE GOVERNOR DURING THIS

02:32:47.525 --> 02:32:49.260
IS. WE GET SOME BIG

02:32:49.326 --> 02:32:51.395
ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT SOME PROGRAM

02:32:51.462 --> 02:32:54.798
IS GOING TO BE. AMAZING AND

02:32:54.865 --> 02:32:55.966
I'LL TELL YOU A LOT OF PARTS OF

02:32:56.033 --> 02:32:57.801
THE STATE DON'T REALLY SEE THAT

02:32:57.868 --> 02:33:00.004
EVER ACTUALLY COME TO FRUITION.

02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:02.873
THAT'S NOT TO UNDERMINE THE

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:03.407
WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT

02:33:03.474 --> 02:33:05.609
ASSIST. I YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN

02:33:05.676 --> 02:33:06.844
I SEE IT LIKE- THIS WAS

02:33:06.911 --> 02:33:08.379
EVERYWHERE AND IT WAS SO GREAT

02:33:08.445 --> 02:33:09.847
FOR ALL PARTS OF THE STATE I

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:12.750
MEAN. WE DIDN'T SEE IT. SO AND

02:33:12.816 --> 02:33:14.685
I DO THINK IT'S- YOU'LL BE GOOD

02:33:14.752 --> 02:33:16.921
TO GET THAT DATA. NOW WHERE WAS

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:19.089
A SAD AND EACH EACH PART OF THE

02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:22.293
STATE COUNTY BY COUNTY- AND

02:33:22.359 --> 02:33:26.430
LOOK I MEAN. AGAIN I DON'T WANT

02:33:26.497 --> 02:33:27.831
TO HAD I REALLY DON'T WANT TO

02:33:27.898 --> 02:33:28.866
BE NEGATIVE I THINK THERE HAS

02:33:28.933 --> 02:33:30.167
BEEN SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS I

02:33:30.234 --> 02:33:32.336
WILL REITERATE THAT AGAIN BUT

02:33:32.403 --> 02:33:34.371
WE STILL HAVE TO I THINK YOU

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:36.507
ARE. A BETTER JOB OF GETTING TO

02:33:36.574 --> 02:33:37.741
ALL PARTS OF THE STATE AND ALL

02:33:37.808 --> 02:33:41.178
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE- AND

02:33:41.245 --> 02:33:42.413
RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS IS JUST GOT

02:33:42.479 --> 02:33:44.582
TO BE ON VACCINATIONS RIGHT AND

02:33:44.648 --> 02:33:46.850
ENSURING THAT- WE'RE WE'RE

02:33:46.917 --> 02:33:48.686
REALLY GETTING TO THESE

02:33:48.752 --> 02:33:53.290
POPULATIONS. MR QUICK COMMENT

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:55.192
HAVE A ONE MORE COMMON VIA SOME

02:33:55.259 --> 02:33:56.627
VICE CHAIR CERTAIN THANK YOU

VERY MUCH- IN A KIND OF PIGGY

02:33:58.762 --> 02:34:00.764
BACKING ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:34:00.831 --> 02:34:02.800
GALLAGHER'S COMMENTS. YOU KNOW

02:34:02.866 --> 02:34:03.734
THE MOST EQUITABLE AND WE'VE

02:34:03.801 --> 02:34:06.203
SAID THIS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN-KIND OF SAYING THIS FROM THE

02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:07.571
VERY BEGINNING. THE MOST

02:34:07.638 --> 02:34:10.007
EQUITABLE APPROACH. TO DEALING

02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:12.810
WITH A PANDEMIC. IS TO GET AS

02:34:12.876 --> 02:34:14.578
MANY PEOPLE VACCINATED AS

02:34:14.645 --> 02:34:15.512
POSSIBLE IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT

02:34:15.579 --> 02:34:17.247
OF TIME. BECAUSE THAT COVERS

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:18.882
EVERYBODY AND THAT'S AS MANY

02:34:18.949 --> 02:34:19.950
PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO GET

02:34:20.017 --> 02:34:22.386
IT. AND RIGHT I AT THE

02:34:22.453 --> 02:34:23.687
BEGINNING THERE WAS A SUPPLY

02:34:23.754 --> 02:34:25.255
ISSUE AND WE'RE TRYING TO

02:34:25.322 --> 02:34:26.657
BALANCE OUT WELL IT'S YOU KNOW

02:34:26.724 --> 02:34:27.858
A LITTLE BIT HERE AND A LITTLE

02:34:27.925 --> 02:34:28.959
BIT THERE WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY

02:34:29.026 --> 02:34:30.761
GET END OF EACH OTHER. AND IT

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:34.064
REALLY SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN.

02:34:34.131 --> 02:34:35.399
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING. A

02:34:35.466 --> 02:34:37.701
SUPPLIER VACCINATIONS THAT WE

02:34:37.768 --> 02:34:39.403
HAVE MORE SUPPLY THAN DEMAND

02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:42.439
PROBABLY. AND AND SO NOW IS IT

02:34:42.506 --> 02:34:44.975
IS THE TIME THAT THIS THIS

02:34:45.042 --> 02:34:47.344
OUTREACH IS SUPER IMPORTANT.

02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:49.046
BECAUSE ANYBODY HAS BEEN LEFT

02:34:49.113 --> 02:34:51.949
BEHIND. HAS THE OPPORTUNITY IF

02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:53.784
WE GIVE IT TO ARM TO GO DO THAT

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:55.953
AND MR GALLAGHER IS ABSOLUTELY

02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:56.654
RIGHT WE GOT TO GO OUT THERE

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:58.689
AND GET THAT. NOW THAT WE HAVE

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:00.858
THAT. AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT AS

02:35:00.924 --> 02:35:03.560
OTHERS GET. THE OTHER PEOPLE

02:35:03.627 --> 02:35:04.328
THAT MAY NOT FALL INTO THOSE

02:35:04.395 --> 02:35:09.600
CATEGORIES- GET VACCINATED-THEY- THEY CREATE LESS EXPOSURE

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:11.001
FOR THOSE THAT DO FALL INTO

02:35:11.068 --> 02:35:12.503
THOSE CATEGORIES. WHEN THEY'RE

02:35:12.569 --> 02:35:14.171
AT THE MARKET WHEN THEY'RE AT-

02:35:14.238 --> 02:35:15.806
WHATEVER OTHER EVENTS ARE OUT

02:35:15.873 --> 02:35:17.574
THERE- WHEN THEY'RE WALKING

02:35:17.641 --> 02:35:20.177
AROUND AT DISNEYLAND- OR OR ANY

02:35:20.244 --> 02:35:22.212
OTHER THINGS WERE MASS CROWDS

02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:24.548
GRABBED THE BEACH. SO ALL OF

02:35:24.615 --> 02:35:26.583
THAT HELPS CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT

02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:28.886
OUR MAIN GOAL HAS TO BE IN A

02:35:28.952 --> 02:35:31.088
PANDEMIC. WHICH IS GET AS MANY

02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:33.223

02:35:33.290 --> 02:35:35.392
VACCINATED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

02:35:35.459 --> 02:35:37.494
AND THEN AT THE END WE'RE ABLE

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:38.562
TO GATHER THOSE THAT HAD THE

02:35:38.629 --> 02:35:40.264
HESITANCY THEY WERE SLOWING THE

02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:41.732
PROCESS DOWN WE CAN LET THE

02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:42.900
PROCESS GETS SLOW DOWN LIKE

02:35:42.966 --> 02:35:45.469

02:36:36.987 --> 02:36:38.422
AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE WE

02:36:38.489 --> 02:36:40.424

02:37:00.177 --> 02:37:00.677
YEAH THE REASON WHY THAT'S

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:01.278
REALLY AND- IS BECAUSE OF THE

02:37:01.345 --> 02:37:03.280
