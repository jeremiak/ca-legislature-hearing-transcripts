WELL THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- AND I RISE THIS AFTERNOON TO PRESENT HOUSE RESOLUTION HOUSE RESOLUTION NINETY FIVE. WHICH DECLARES MARCH TWENTY THIRD TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AS AGRICULTURE DAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS YEAR LET US HIGHLIGHT THE VITAL ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN FUELING OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. AND FEEDING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS A MODEL OF PRODUCTIVITY OF INNOVATION AND EFFICIENCY. OUR FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS SET THE BAR HIGH HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY AGRICULTURE. THE COMMITTEE- I'VE TOURED AND TRAVELED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE I HAVE BEEN JOINED BY MANY OF YOU TO MEET SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO GROW OUR FOOD FARMERS AND RANCHERS FARMWORKERS. ADVOCACY IN SOME COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AND THERE IS NO. NO PARALLEL FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE NOT IN THE UNITED STATES OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. THE MOST OBVIOUS FACT ABOUT OUR STATE'S AGRICULTURE IS EXTRAORDINARY. THIS DIVERSITY. AS OF NOW- OUR STATE WE PRODUCE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SOME DIFFERENT COMMODITIES HAS OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND FARMS AND RANCHES OF WHICH NEARLY FOUR FIFTHS OUR INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY OWNED. AS THE NATION'S LEADER IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS WE SHIP SOME BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FOOD SOME COMMODITIES AROUND THE WORLD EVERY SINGLE YEAR. CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE STRONG AND IS RESILIENT. WE DO HOWEVER FACE CHALLENGES. RECENTLY WE'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE IMPACTS OF CONGESTION AT OUR PORTS. EVEN AS COVER NINETEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AN UNPRECEDENTED WILDFIRES ATTESTED THIS INDUSTRY'S CAPACITY. AND YET ACROSS OUR STATE FARMERS CONTINUE TO PLANT. WORKERS CONTINUE TO HARVEST SO THAT CALIFORNIANS COULD KEEP EATING. MOVING FORWARD WE MUST KEEP INNOVATING INNOVATIVE SO THAT OUR AGRIC AG INDUSTRY CAN COMPETE IN A GLOBAL MARKET. WE MUST IMPROVE OUR WATER MANAGEMENT AND WATER STORAGE CAPACITY. SO CROPS THEY CAN CONTINUE TO FLOURISH IN ARE DROUGHT PRONE STATE. AND FINALLY WE MUST DO MORE TO PROTECT THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HARD WORKING FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO GROW OUR FOOD. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M THE SON OF MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS. IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME TO CALIFORNIA IN SEARCH OF OPPORTUNITY AND A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THEY WORK HARD IN THE FIELDS SO THAT I CAN HAVE A CHANCE AT A BETTER LIFE. IN THE SAME STORY IS TRUE FOR MILLIONS OF FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY AS A STATE. SO WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY THE DOOR TO OPPORTUNITY REMAINS OPEN CALIFORNIA FARMWORKERS FACE CHALLENGES AT WORK AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN MANY IF NOT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S RULE AGRICULTURAL REGIONS OF OUR STATE POVERTY AND LACK OF ADEQUATE HOUSING PREVAILS. YOU WILL FARMWORKERS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN WORKING TO FEED CALIFORNIANS FOOD AND SECURITY. IS AMONG THE MANY CHALLENGES THEY FACE DAILY IN ADDITION TO FACE THE WILD FIRES AND TOXIC AIR QUALITY CONDITIONS INCREASING HEAT WAVES AND- THE ECONOMIC IN AND HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF AN ON GOING GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WE MUST ENSURE THAT ALL FARMWORKERS ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT BOTH ON THE JOB AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A HISTORY OF ALWAYS ALWAYS LIFTING EVERYONE UP AS WE RISE. AND TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS RANCHERS FARM WORKERS AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO HELPED MAKE OUR AG INDUSTRY THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. WE ARE PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL MISTER SPEAKER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE FIRST CALL. ROLL CALL OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO JOIN ME IN CELEBRATING CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE DAY.

ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL LIMIT THREE BY FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER KAMLAGER AND OTHER GENETICALLY THEIR INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE. MISTER KALRA THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THREE THE CALIFORNIA ABOLITION ACT ON BEHALF OF SENATOR KAMLAGER. MEMBERS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IS LONG OVERDUE. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE EXCEPT TO PUNISH CRIME. AC THREE SEEKS TO AMEND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION TO REMOVE SUCH CONDITIONAL LANGUAGE ABOLISHING FORCED LABOR AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE WITHOUT EXCEPTION. OVER NINETY FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN STATE PRISONS AFTER AMERICANS ACCOUNT 420% OF THE PRISON POPULATION OF LESS THAN 6% OF CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL POPULATION. ALTHOUGH NO COURTS EXPLICITLY INCLUDE LABOR AS A CONDITION OF CRIMINAL SENTENCING THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT MANY INCARCERATED PEOPLE PERFORM LABOR OFTENTIMES FOR AS LITTLE AS EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR. TO SUSAN TODAY TWELVE STATES PROHIBIT IN SLAVEN AN INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE BUT EXCEPTION PROVISIONS FOR CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT REMAIN NINE STATES PERMIT INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AS A CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT CALIFORNIA BEING ONE OF THEM. DISSOLVING THE REMNANTS OF SLAVERY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN COLORADO PASSED A BALLOT MEASURE THAT REMOVE SLAVERY AND INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE IS A CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT FROM ITS STATE CONSTITUTION. IN TWENTY TWENTY VOTERS NEBRASKA AND UTAH VOTED TO REMOVE PRISON SLAVERY FROM THEIR STATE CONSTITUTIONS THAT SAME YEAR U. S. SENATOR MERKLEY OF OREGON INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION TO REMOVE INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AS A PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME FROM THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. AC THREE WILL NOT DEAL WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING PROGRAMS THESE PROGRAMS STILL FUNCTION IN STATES LIKE COLORADO WHERE SIMILAR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS HAVE TAKEN EFFECT. THE NATURE OF THIS MEASURES ALSO SO IMPORTANTLY SYMBOLIC OUR CONSTITUTION SERVES AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR ALL OTHER STATE LAWS. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SLAVERY FORCED LABOUR OR INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE ON OUR BOOKS RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL AC. THREE THANK YOU MISTER KALRA. SEEING NO MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM.

I WANTED TO SHARE HIS STORY TO SHOW THE INFLUENCE THAT ONE CAN HAVE ON OTHERS SUCH AS MY MOTHER AND MYSELF TO SERVE THE PUBLIC GOOD. MY GRANDFATHER WAS THE GRANDSON OF EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME FROM GERMANY FEELING PERSECUTED BECAUSE OF THEIR JEWISH FAITH. THEY WOULD SETTLE INTO NEW YORK CITY BEFORE AND DURING THE DEPRESSION WHERE HE WOULD GROW UP. AS A TEENAGER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FORTIES HE IDOLIZED FDR WHO HE SAID HAD SAVED AMERICA FROM THE DESPAIR OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SO AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN MY GRANDFATHER JEROME ENROLLED INTO HARVARD THE VERY ALMA MATER THAT FDR HAD SO THAT HE COULD ALSO BE A PART TO CHANGE OUR WORLD. HE WENT THERE ON A SPECIAL WARTIME DEGREE TO BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY GET HIS UNDERGRADUATE AS WELL AS HIS LAW DEGREE. AND IT WAS THERE AT HARVARD IN THE EARLY FORTIES THAT HE RECOGNIZED THAT THEY WERE TEACHING PUBLIC POLICY IN A VACUUM. THAT THEY WERE NOT RECOGNIZING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE ENORMITY OF THE **** CRIMES AND THE HOOK ATROCITIES THAT WERE OCCURRING TO THE JEWISH PEOPLE THAT HE ADVOCATED AND FOUGHT FOR AND ESTABLISH THE HARVARD LAW FOR. A FOREIGN THAT WAS INTENDED TO BRING SOME OF THE GREATEST MINDS IN SPEAKERS TO HARVARD. OVER TIME THOSE SPEAKERS HAVE INCLUDED THE REVEREND DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. INCLUDED IN THERE IS SUPREME COURT JUSTICES RUTH BADER GINSBURG THURGOOD MARSHALL AND PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER. THAT LAW SCHOOL SPEAKER SERIES IS STILL GOING ON TODAY AND IS THE LONGEST ACTING LAW SCHOOL SPEAKER SERIES IN AMERICA. WHILE HE WAS THERE IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IN BOSTON MY GRANDFATHER BEGAN TO TAKE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT FIRST IN CAMPAIGNS BY WORKING ON JOHN HEINZ'S MAYORAL CAMPAIGN AND SECONDS BY WORKING TO MAKE SURE. THAT BOSTON WAS CHANGING THE VERY CITY COUNCILS AND SCHOOL BOARDS. IT WAS ALSO DURING THAT TIME THAT HE BEFRIENDED A YOUNG JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY. ANY BECAME HIS ASSISTANT CAMPAIGN MANAGER AS HE TOOK ON THEN INCUMBENT REPUBLICAN FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE SEAT. AFTER THAT ELECTION MY GRANDFATHER FORMED THE GREATER BOSTON REGIONAL COUNCIL TO ENSURE THAT BOSTON WAS PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE THROUGH A THOUGHTFUL MODERNIZATION EFFORT THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE BIGGEST REDEVELOPMENT EVER IN THE CITY OF BOSTON. MY GRANDFATHER WAS ALSO A STRONG BELIEVER IN THE POWER OF PHILANTHROPY HE HELPS TO ESTABLISH SEVERAL PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE THAT BELIEF IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE HE ESTABLISHED THE RAPAPORT URBAN FELLOWSHIP THAT WOULD GRANT SCHOLARSHIPS TO ELECTED STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS IN THE GREATER BOSTON AREA WHO WISH TO PURSUE A MASTER'S DEGREE AT HARVARD'S KENNEDY SCHOOL. HE ALSO ESTABLISHED THE RAPAPORT INSTITUTE AT HARVARD AS WELL AS THE RAPPAPORT CENTER FOR LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY AT BOSTON COLLEGE WHICH CREATED A NETWORK OF HUNDREDS OF CIVIC MINDED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO SERVING. THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE CURRENT BOSTON MAYOR MICHELLE WU WAS A FORMER FELLOW. HE ALSO WORKED WITH THE CURE ALZHEIMER'S FUND DUE TO THE PAINFUL LOSS OF HIS OWN MOTHER CORA TO THAT DISEASE. MY MOTHER IS HIS SECOND ELDEST CHILD. AND I AM HIS OLDEST GRAND CHILD.
