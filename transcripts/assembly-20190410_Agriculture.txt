PROFESSIONS CODE FOR CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND LABELING THE FIRST PICS STANDARDIZES CANNABIS CULTIVATION LICENCES BY ADDRESSING THE DISCREPANCY AND TYPE ONE C. LICENSES. THE SECOND FIX CLARIFIES LANGUAGE RELATED TO CANNABIS APPELLATIONS AND INCLUDES OF ORIGIN INTO THAT DEFINITION OVERALL AB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT IT'S A SIMPLE CLEAN A BILL THAT MAKES TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING CHANGES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT TO PROVIDE FURTHER TESTIMONY ON HIS BILL IS LOUIS BROWN OF THE INTERNATIONAL CANNABIS FARMERS ASSOCIATION MISTER BROWN. IT WAS FANTASTIC. THAT WAS A BASIC INTRODUCTION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE INTO INTERNATIONAL CANNABIS FARMERS ASSOCIATION. JUST AS OUR AUTHOR STATED THIS IS REALLY A TECHNICAL CLEAN UP BILL -- BUT ONE THAT MAKES A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE -- FOR THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY A PARTICULARLY WITH THE CLARIFICATION FOR THE SPECIALTY COTTAGE LICENSE WHICH YOU'RE TRADITIONALLY SMALL FARMERS -- AND ADDING A SQUARE FOOTAGE ALLOWANCE TO THAT WOULD THEN BRING IT INTO LINE WITH ALL THE OTHER LICENSES. AND THEN MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THOSE SMALL FARMERS CAN QUALIFY FOR THAT KADDISH LICENSE A JUST THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LICENSE PRICE. MAKES A SIGNIFICANT -- SUBSTANTIAL -- ISSUE FOR THOSE SMALL FARMERS AND SO -- IT IS A MINOR CHANGE IN STATUTE BUT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOR THE INDUSTRY WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. COME TO THE MICROPHONE. HI THANK YOU MY NAME IS KAREN WAGNER AND I AM FROM HUMBLE COUNTY I AM A HAVE MY MANUFACTURING LICENSE JUST GOT MY FULL ANNUAL LICENSE WILL WHO.

AMIL GROWERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND NOW HUMBOLDT COUNTY GROWERS ASSOCIATION I AM HERE. TO PLEAD WITH YOU TO PUT THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE BACK IN THE BILL. THAT ALLOWED FOR A SON GROWN AG COMMISSION. I AM TERRIBLY DISMAYED THAT THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY GROWERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THEMSELVES TO REPRESENT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SMALL FARMERS IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY AND HAVE THAT LANGUAGE STRUCK. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE SMALL GROWERS OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY HAVE A SON GROWN ADD COMMISSION IN ORDER TO BETTER COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE. I AM ON THE FRONT LINES I THINK HE'S TELLING THESE ARE YOU SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL OR MUSICIAN I'M SPEAK. WELL I GUESS I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF REINSTATING THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IN THE BILL I DO SUPPORT ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF THE BILL BUT THE ORIGINAL BILL HAVE THE SUN GROWN ACTIVE THE THE ABILITY TO FORM A SONG GROWN AG COMMISSION. AND THROUGH THE LOBBYING EFFORTS OF ONE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND HUMBOLDT COUNTY THAT LANGUAGE WAS STRUCK AND SO I'M VERY DISMAYED ABOUT THAT AND I PLEAD. FOR ADDITIONAL TIME IN ORDER TO GATHER MORE SUPPORT FROM OUR FARMERS THAT DESPERATELY NEED THIS SON GROWN ACT COMMISSION IN ORDER TO BETTER COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE. OKAY WELL THIS IS THIS BILL IF IT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD ON THIS COMMITTEE WILL HAVE A ALL A LOT MORE TIME FOR MORE CONVERSATIONS TO OCCUR. AS THE PROCESS GOES FORWARD BUT I THINK YOU FOR COMING DOWN FROM HUMBLE OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING I APPRECIATE IT. ANYBODY ELSE SPEAKING CAN POTENTIAL SUPPORT.

RIGHT NOW WILL BE LOOKING FOR AUTHORS. IN ADDITION TO MEMBERS THE BUT WHAT THAT FOR HOW ABOUT I'M I'M AN AUTHOR SO I WILL TURN THIS OVER RIGHT NOW TO MR MATHIS. MADAM CHAIR IF YOU WOULD PRESENT AB EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT MADAM SECRETARY LOOKS LIKE WE OF CORN COULD [inaudible] EGGMAN. HERE EGGMAN HERE MATHIS HERE MATHIS HERE AGGIE A CURRY. CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM HERE FLORA. GRAY -- WHEN? I WHEN HERE JONES SAWYER -- SO YOU'RE HERE QUIRK ROBERT RIVAS SALAS [inaudible] CELLS PRESENT. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A QUORUM SO WE CAN OFFICIALLY START. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS -- THE DATA SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE FORMING IN THE UNITED STATES WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT -- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT ARE ESTABLISH FARMERS ARE ALSO GROWING OLDER THE OLDER GENERATION OF PRODUCERS IS RAPIDLY AGING OUT WELL YOUNGER GENERATIONS OF EXISTING FARMING FAMILIES ARE INCREASINGLY CHOOSING TO LEAVE THE SECTOR. SO WE NEED TO FIND ALWAYS WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE TO THE BUSINESS -- IN ORDER TO TRULY BE SUSTAINABLE. WE ALSO NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THESE DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS BY LOOKING AT WAYS. TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY WE KNOW THERE'S A DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA -- AND FARMING IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW DO WE PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THAT. SO AB EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT SIX TO DO THIS BY ESTABLISHING THE FORMER EQUITY AND INNOVATION CENTER A COORDINATED STATEWIDE PROGRAM FOCUSING ON HELPING SMALL FARMERS AND RANCHERS. PARTICULAR FARMERS AND RANCHERS OF COLOR. THE SENATOR THE CENTER IS MODELED AFTER THE SMALL FORM PROGRAM THAT EXISTED FOR DECADES -- UNDER THE UC. I'M CULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES BUT WAS ENDED DUE TO BUDGET CUTS FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION. WELL THERE ARE STILL FOR SMALL FORWARD BIJAN THE STATE AND NUMEROUS UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION STAFF WHO WORK ON SMALL FARM ISSUES. THESE EFFORTS ARE DESPERATE IN CAN VERY AND FOCUS ACROSS THE MANY PROGRAMS OF THE UC OPERATES. THE FORM EQUITY AND INNOVATION CENTER WILL ACT AS A CENTRAL HUB TO COORDINATE BETWEEN THE SMALL FARM ADVISORS AN EXISTING YOU SEE A AND R.. PROGRAMS WITH THE SMALL FORM NEXUS WHILE PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES TO SMALL FARMERS AND RANCHERS. WE FORESEE THE CENTER OFFERING ASSISTANCE WITH FARM RANCH MANAGEMENT MARKETING RESEARCH RELATED TO WATER MANAGEMENT AIR QUALITY AS WELL AS GENERAL FARMING TECHNIQUES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH GRANT LOAN APPLICATIONS AND FORMER. TO FARM WORKER TO FORMER TRAINING AS WE KNOW OUR STATE PASSES A LOT OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS -- THAT HAS SOMETIMES PUSH THINGS TO A LARGER MORE CORPORATE WAY OF FARMING WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE SMALL FARMERS SMALL FARMING FAMILIES. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THEY NEED SOME SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE BIG LIKE A TO HIRE THEIR OWN COMPLIANCE OFFICER SO THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE SET UP TO BE ABLE. TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED AND I HAVE THREE FIND WITNESSES HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT. WE GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND MASS OF POOR SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT SO WHO BE AS BRIEF AND GET TO THE POINT THANK YOU RIGHT. WELL I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY -- MY NAME IS MARK RUTH DAHLQUIST WILLARD AND I'M A SMALL FARMS ADVISER IN FRESNO AND TULARE COUNTIES SO ONE OF THE FOUR THAT WAS MENTIONED THAT STILL REMAIN. AND ON BEHALF OF ALL THE OTHER SMALL FARMS ADVISORS AS WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL AND I THINK IT REALLY COULD GREATLY EXPAND THE WORK THAT WE DO -- SO -- AS WITH DESCRIBES WE CURRENTLY PROVIDE EXTENSION SUPPORT TO FARMERS WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY. NOT BEEN REACHED OUT WELL BY EXTENSIONAL A TRADITIONAL EXTENSION PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY THE SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS -- FOR EXAMPLE IN FRESNO WHERE I MUSCLE FARMS ADVISER WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE MOM FARMING COMMUNITY GOING BACK ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND BECAUSE WE HAVE THOSE LONG TERM TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS OFFERING PRACTICAL SUPPORT -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THINGS LIKE HELP SOME OF THESE FARMERS APPLY FOR SWEET FUNDING. SO FAR WE'VE HAD OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN SWEET GRANTS THAT WERE AWARDED TO THESE FARMERS THROUGH OUR ASSISTANCE WHO WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THAT PROGRAM -- I ALSO LEVERAGE OTHER RESOURCES WITHIN A IN OUR TO HELP THESE FARMERS FROM PROGRAMS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON SMALL SCALE FARMS BUT THAT. I'M ABLE TO BRING THOSE RESOURCES AND FOR EXAMPLE IN FRESNO WE HAVE A VEGETABLE CROPS ADVISER. WHO MAINLY SERVES A LARGE SCALE COMMODITIES LIKE PROCESSING TOMATOES ON THE WEST SIDE OF FRESNO -- BUT BECAUSE I'M THERE'S A SMALL FARMS ADVISER I CAN BRING THE GROWERS TO HIM WHO NEED EXTRA SUPPORT WITH FOR EXAMPLE DIAGNOSING DISEASES ON THEIR SPECIALTIES AND VEGETABLE CROPS AND BECAUSE WE CAN MAKE THAT CONNECTION. THEY'RE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT SUPPORT AS WELL -- SO WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE -- IN IN OUR TO PROVIDE EXTENSION SUPPORT. TO THESE UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS -- AND SO WHILE WE DO STILL HAVE SOME SMALL FIRMS WERE GOING ON THERE'S MANY FARMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT WE CAN'T ADEQUATELY SUPPORT. OF FOR EXAMPLE IN FRESNO AND TULARE COUNTIES COMBINED WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND SMALL FARMS -- AND THERE ARE MANY SIMILAR FARMS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY ESPECIALLY MERRY BETWEEN FRESNO SACRAMENTO WHERE WE DON'T HAVE SMALL FARMS ADVISERS IN THOSE COUNTIES -- AND THEY WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM EXTENSION SUPPORT -- AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT IN OUR IS DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF PROBABLE SHORTAGE OF FUNDS RIGHT NOW. DUE TO OUR FLAT BUDGETS -- IN IF IT DOES REMAIN FLAT WE MAY BE LOOKING AT CUTS TO ALL OF OUR STATEWIDE PROGRAM SO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FLAT BUDGET WITH A NEW STATEWIDE PROGRAM BEING PROPOSED. WE JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT ANY STATEWIDE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE MANDATED BY THE BILL ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED AND I KNOW THAT'S A SEPARATE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BUDGET. SO. AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONSIDERING THIS LEGISLATION AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT FURTHER. THANK YOU. PLUS I WANNA ECHO -- RUTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY BEARD ALSO SUPPORT MY NAME IS BORN STRONG AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ASIAN BUSINESSES WHO RESOURCE AND CENTER. AND WOMEN FORTUNE OF TO PARTNER WITH THEM -- FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS BUT REALLY WORKED HARD WITH OUR SMALL FARMERS -- WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF HOLES OF ISSUES AND SOME THE BIGGEST THING IS CULTURAL COMPETENCY AN APPROPRIATE -- NISSEN TERMS WORKING WITH THESE FARMERS IT IS SO CRITICAL TO HAVE. AGENCIES THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO REACH TO THIS ISSUE NO FARMING IS A LIVELIHOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AS A MEANS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUSTAINABLE FAMILY UNIT TO GOING BACK ON ON ON SUPPORT. AND SO THE SMALL FARMING -- OPPORTUNITIES ESPECIALLY WITH NEEDED RESOURCE WE HAVE. IT IS IS NEEDED BECAUSE OF INCREDIBLE CHALLENGE IN THE COMPLEXITY OF POLICIES ISSUES THAT ARE COMING THROUGH. AND TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH AGENCY THAT CAN HELP US TO PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL SAYS AND WHAT WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON THE CULTURAL SIDE. IS IS IS AN INCREDIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FORM BUT ALSO TO SUPPORT AND AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT AND AND I HOPE THAT -- YOU GUYS CONSIDER IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WHAT'S NEEDED BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE JUST ONE PIECE IN CENTRAL VALLEY BUT THERE'S A HUGE COMMUNITY THAT'S UP IN MERCED STOCKTON SACRAMENTO YOU BEAR.

OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING PER MEAL TO PURCHASE ORGANIC. CALIFORNIA GROWN LOCALLY PRODUCED FOODS WELL COSTS IN AVAILABILITY ISSUES PREVENT MANY COMMUNITIES FROM ACCESSING. LOCAL AND IN SEASON FOODS MEALS PROVIDE THE SCHOOL SETTING A PRACTICAL WAY TO INCREASE CHILDREN'S NUTRITION. OF THIS -- TO DETERMINE ACCESS SUCCESS OF THE PILOT BOTH THE PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG WILL REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATOR ON THE OUTCOMES THIS REPORTING IS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE WHETHER INVESTING IN PROVIDING KIDS WITH HEALTHY LOCAL FOODS. IS MONEY WELL SPENT I'M WORKING WITH MANY THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE AND I HAVE WITNESSES HERE WITH ME TODAY AND THEY CAN AND DO SOME CELLS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST WITNESSED AND SUPPORT PLEASE MADAM TURN COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COMMENT ON A. B. NINE FIFTY EIGHT MY NAME IS JENNA MULLER -- I'M AN OWNER OF FULL BELLY FARM WE ARE A FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY ACRE AGAIN A FARM IN WESTERN YOLO COUNTY WE GROW ABOUT EIGHTY DIFFERENT THINGS ON OUR FARM. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR -- AND WE SELL OUR PRODUCE IN THE WHOLESALE MARKETS THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY SUPPORTED AGRICULTURE PROGRAM -- AND ALSO AT FARMERS MARKETS -- WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY FULL TIME YEAR ROUND EMPLOYEES. ORGANIC FARMS ARE INEVITABLY GOING TO EXPERIENCE SOME GROWING PAINS IN THE COMING YEARS WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR COSTS RISING INCLUDING THE COST OF LABOR THE COST OF FUEL ACOSTA COMPOST THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE. AND THE PRICE OF FOOD IS LARGELY STAYING THE SAME. SO FORGET IT FARMS TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE IN THE COMING YEARS WE NEED TO GET MORE CREATIVE IN OUR SALES OUTLETS AND FIND NEW MARKETS FOR AGAIN ECKLEY GROWN FOOD. AB NINE FIFTY EIGHT AS A WAY TO HELP SUPPORT ORGANIC FARMS IN A CHANGING AND CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. AWFUL BELLY FARM MY FARM HAS BEEN PARTNERING WITH THE WINTERS JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE PAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS -- EVERY WEEK WE DELIVER ORGANIC FOOD DIRECTLY TO THE SCHOOL WHICH THEY THEN USE IN THEIR SCHOOL LUNCHES. AND OVER THE COURSE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP THE WINTER SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS PURCHASED OVER EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF FOOD FROM OUR FARM -- THIS IS BEEN AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR US NOT JUST ON A FINANCIAL LEVEL ONE CRITICISM OF THE ORGANIC MODEL IS THAT IT IS INACCESSIBLE TO THOSE WITHOUT A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH INCOME. AS THE COST OF PRODUCTION IS HIGHER THAN CONVENTIONALLY GROWN FOOD WE AS FARMERS MUCH CHARGE A HIGH ENOUGH PRICE TO KEEP OUR FARMS FINANCIALLY VIABLE. BUYING DIRECTLY FROM OUR FIRM IS MEANT TO THE SCHOOL CHILDREN IN WINTERS HOW THEY ARE ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EAT SEASONALLY AND EXPERIENCE TRULY FRESH AND HEALTHY FOOD. AB NINE FIFTY EIGHT IS ONE MUCH NEEDED STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF GETTING CALIFORNIA GROWN ORGANIC FOOD INTO THE DAILY LIVES OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN.
