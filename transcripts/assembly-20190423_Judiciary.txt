AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO CONTRACT WITH NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED MINORS AND NON MINERS CURRENTLY IN FOSTER CARE. WHAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES THE UNACCOMPANIED UNDOCUMENTED MINORS WHO ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE CARE AND CUSTODY OF THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT BE PROVIDED WITH LEGAL SERVICES? THIS PROTECTION DOES NOT EXTEND TO UNDOCUMENTED MINORS OR NON MINORS IN CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT UNDOCUMENTED DEPENDENCE IN CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM ARE PROVIDED WITH ESSENTIAL IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES NECESSARY. TO SEEK LAWFUL RESIDENCY IN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY IS SUSAN ABRAMS THE POLICY DIRECTOR.

IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- I WANT TO START BY THINKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE. FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION WHICH WILL SERVE TO PROTECT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO LEGAL IMMIGRATION SERVICES. MOST UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE QUALIFY FOR IMMIGRATION RELIEF THROUGH SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS ALSO REFER TO ASSIDUOUS. THIS WAS ENACTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO ALLOW ABUSED ABANDONED AND NEGLECTED UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN TO ATTAIN LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENCY. AND ENTERED PROVIDE GREATER STABILITY FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HOWEVER IN TODAY'S POLITICAL CLIMATE THIS RELIEF IS DIFFICULT. TO OBTAIN WITHOUT LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND THERE'S NO MECHANISM RIGHT NOW TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE RECEIVE THIS LEGAL RESEARCH. ASSISTANTS AND AS A RESULT SOME CHILDREN NEVER RECEIVED THE RELIEF TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED. UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO EXIT FOSTER CARE WITHOUT APPLYING FOR SIEGES OR ANOTHER FORM OF RELIEF WILL BE UNABLE TO WORK AND TRANSITION TO SUCCESSFUL ADULTHOOD WE ARE SETTING THESE YOUTH UP FOR FAILURE. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WILL ADDRESS THISSIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN TWO WAYS. FIRST IT WILL REQUIRE NOTICE TO MINORS COUNCIL. OF ANY IMMIGRATION ISSUES SO WE CAN WORK TO ENSURE OUR CLIENTS GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. AND SECOND IT WILL CREATE A FUNDING SOURCE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO CONTRACT WITH NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION THANK YOU.

AND THE SECOND THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER. I AM HERE PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FOUR TWO WHICH WILL REQUIRE ATTORNEYS AND JUDGES TO PARTY PARTAKE IN CONTINUAL EDUCATION ON IMPLICIT BIAS. EVERY THREE YEARS AND COURT PERSONNEL EVERY TWO YEARS. THE BIAS IS THE UNCONSCIOUS AND UNINTENTIONAL MENTAL SHORT CUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN DEVELOP AND IT AFFECTS US ALL. IT IS OFTEN SUBTLE ASSOCIATIONS WE MAKE BETWEEN GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND STEREO TYPES ABOUT THOSE GROUPS. WE KNOW THAT EXPLICIT BIAS PERSISTS LIKE RACISM SEXISM AND OTHER FORMS OF BIGOTRY AND AS A RESULT CLEAR ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS ARE IN PLACE TO HELP CHECK THOSE. MOST OF US WOULD LIKE TO BE FREE OF BIASES ATTITUDES AND STEREOTYPES THAT LEAD US TO JUDGE PEOPLE BASED ON THE SOCIAL CATEGORIES THEY BELONG TO SUCH AS RACE OR GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN UNCONSCIOUS AN IMPLICIT BIAS THESE AND THOSE ARE EQUALLY IMPACTFUL. DESPITE PEOPLE'S BEST INTENTIONS RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT SUBJECTS CAN CONSCIOUSLY EMBRACE IDEAS OF FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY AND YET ON TESTS THAT MEASURE SUBCONSCIOUS TENDENCIES STILL SHOW A STRONG PROPENSITY TO LEAN ON STEREO TYPES TO FILL IN THE BLANKS ABOUT PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW. IT IS CRITICAL THAT ATTORNEYS JUDGES AND COURT PERSONNEL RECEIVE TRAINING ON A ROUTINE BASIS TO RECOGNIZE THEIR IMPLICIT BIAS THESE AND TAKES STEPS TO COUNTER ACT THEIR UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCES. WHEN PEOPLE ENTER INTO A COURT ROOM OR ENCOUNTER THE COURT SYSTEM? THEY'RE HOPEFUL FOR EQUAL EQUITABLE AND FAIR TREATMENT THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR FUTURES ON THE LINE IN IN THE TRUST OF THE COURT. AND YET UNCONSCIOUS AND IMPLICIT BIAS HE'S CAN AND DO AFFECT THE DAY TO DAY DECISION MAKING PROCESS THESE OF EVEN THE MOST AWARE COURT OFFICERS. YET CHANGE CAN COME THROUGH EDUCATION INTERACTION AND CONVERSATION. IN THE STATE OF JUDICIARY ADDRESS LAST MONTH SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE TANI CONCEAL SOCCER WAY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE AND EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING FOR JUDGES. AN UNCONSCIOUS BIAS TRAINING MANDATORY FOR ALL COURT ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES. I WOULD LIKE TO BUILD A CULTURE THAT CONSTANTLY AND RESPECTFULLY ADDRESSES BIAS TO STRENGTHEN THE TRUST BETWEEN OFFICERS OF THE COURT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AB TWO FOUR TWO SIX TO AMPLIFY THE SUPREME COURT. CHIEF JUSTICES WORK ON IMPLICIT BIAS AND MANDATE THAT JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS MUST BE TRAINED EVERY THREE YEARS AND COURT PERSONNEL EVERY TWO YEARS. TODAY WITH ME AND SUPPORT IS KIMBERLY PAPPY ON JUDICIAL PROFESSOR AND LISA HOLDER EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY LEGAL DIRECTOR THANK YOU THANK YOU AND IS COVERED OF THERE ARE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE IT ALSO SAVES WHO YOUR TAKING THOSE -- YES WE ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY ABOUT. THE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING I'M LISA HOLDER A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY AND UCLA LAW LECTURER UNCONSTITUTIONAL POLICING SKIP TO SPEAK. WE GET THIS IS A RECORD THANK YOU OKAY. I AM GRATEFUL TO BE HERE THIS MORNING ADDRESSING THIS AUGUST BODY OF LAWMAKERS. AND I ADDRESS YOU TODAY IN MY CAPACITY AS INTERIM LEGAL DIRECTOR OF THE EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY. AND OAKLAND BASED. RACIAL JUSTICE ADVOCACY GROUP. THE EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY IS TRANSFORMING THE NATION'S CONSCIOUSNESS ON RACE THROUGH LITIGATION SOCIAL SCIENCE AND THE ARTS. AND FOR TWENTY YEARS SINCE ITS INCEPTION. ALONG WITH ITS THOUGHT PARTNERS A NETWORK OF JUDGES ATTORNEYS SCIENTISTS. UP. SCIENTISTS AND ACADEMICS THE EAGLE JUST JUST THE SOCIETY HAS BEEN RESEARCHING AND ANALYZING IMPLICIT BIAS AND THE WAY THAT IT IMPACTS INDIVIDUALS. AND THE INSTITUTIONS OPERATED AND CREATED BY INDIVIDUALS. WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE ON THIS BILL WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT THE WORK THAT I DO AN IMPLICIT BIAS? SO MANY OF THEM SAY OH THAT'S GREAT WORK ON I APPLAUD YOU BUT I DON'T HAVE BIAS. WELL ALL PEOPLE HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS. ALL PEOPLE HAVE UNCONSCIOUS BIASES. THAT THEY CANNOT CONTROL WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND INTERVENTIONS. OUR BIASES DEVELOPED DURING THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME THROUGH EXPOSURE TO STEREOTYPES. AN IMPLICIT BIAS. INFLUENCES. NOT ONLY OUR BELIEFS BUT OUR ATTITUDES AND OUR ACTIONS TOWARD OTHER PEOPLE. AND THE WAY THAT WE CREATE AND OPERATE OUR SYSTEMS AND OUR INSTITUTIONS. IN A RESEARCH STUDY INVOLVING SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS THE MOST FREQUENT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO DO YOU PREFER BLACK PEOPLE OR WHITE PEOPLE WAS I HAVE NO PREFERENCE. YET IN THAT SAME STUDY WHEN GIVEN AND IMPERIL TEST THAT MEASURES ONE'S LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS. 70% OF THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR WHITE PEOPLE OVER BLACK PEOPLE. JUDGES COURT PERSONNEL AND ATTORNEYS ARE NOT IMMUNE FROM BIAS THEIR PEOPLE. TO A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDY. DEMONSTRATED THAT JUDGES POSSESS THE SAME LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS AS DO MOSTLY PEOPLE. AT A TWO THOUSAND STEP SEVEN CHEVY STOW THAT JUDGES AND JURORS MAY UNINTENTIONALLY AND AUTOMATICALLY MISS REMEMBER FACTS IN A RACIALLY SKEWED MANNER DURING ALL FACETS OF THE LEGAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT PROSECUTORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHARGE BLACK SUSPECTS THAN WHITE SUSPECTS IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WHEN LEFT UNADDRESSED THE IMPLICIT BIASES OF JUDGES CLERKS AND ATTORNEYS CONTRIBUTES TO AN UNACCEPTABLE RACIAL DISPARITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. IN SAN FRANCISCO LOCALLY BLACK DEFENDANTS ARE HELD IN PRE TRIAL CUSTODY 62% LONGER THAN WHITE DEFENDANTS. AND BLACK DEFENDANTS RECEIVED DEFENDANTS CONVICTED CONVICTED OF THE SAME CRIME. AND NATIONALLY JUDGES SET BAIL AMOUNTS OF BLACK MEN 35% HIGHER THAN FOR WHITE MEN AND FOR LET LATINO MEN 19% HIGHER THAN FOR WHITE MEN. SO SINCE BIAS IS LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME IT'S NOT EASILY -- LEARN BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR CHANGE AND BIAS CAN BE MANAGED THROUGH COUNTER BIAS TRAINING. PRACTICAL TOOLS CAN HELP PARTICIPANTS UNLEARNED STEREOTYPES AND RETRAIN THEIR BRAIN TO DISRUPT STEREO TYPE BASS IMPLICIT ASSOCIATIONS. COUNTERBALANCED COUNTER BIAS TRAINING CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN ITS ONGOING AND REOCCURRING. THE OTHER THING IS THAT STRESSFUL WORKING ENVIRONMENT STIMULATE BIAS. AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO DO THE HARD WORK OF DISRUPTING THEIR BIAS BUT INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AS WELL. INSTITUTIONS NEED TO CREATE POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT STRUCTURES. THAT DE STRESS THE WORK FORCE AND ALLOW PROFESSIONALS TIME TO MAKE CAREFUL AND DELIBERATE DECISIONS. DELIBERATE THOUGHTFUL DECISION MAKING IS THE KEY TO DISRUPTING. FIVE I'VE OBSERVED I DO NEED YOU TO WRAP UP OKAY. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE BODY POLITIC SHARE VALUES OF FAIRNESS EQUITY AND JUSTICE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL THAT STRIVE TO ELIMINATE BIAS. IN INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS TAKES US ONE GIANT LEAP TOWARD THAT MORE PERFECT UNION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY MEDIAN CHAIR -- I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE. THE CONVERSATION THAT IF WE COULD JUST ASSUME ARGUENDO FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONVERSATION THAT BIAS EXISTS AND THAT IT AFFECTS DECISION MAKING -- ON THE BENCH AND BEYOND -- THEN WE GET TO EXPLORE THE QUESTION OF THE VALUE OF TRAINING. OF MAKE WILL IT SIMPLY BE A MOMENT OF COMMON UNDERSTANDING COMING TOGETHER NETWORKING OR WILL IT ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS. BUCKLEY THE NEUROSCIENCE THAT IS AVAILABLE -- GIVES US INSIGHT INTO THAT. EFFECT WAS NEUROSCIENCE THE HELP THE FIRST OPEN THE DOOR. TO HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW BIAS ACTUALLY MANIFEST ITSELF. IF WE HAVE A DIFFERENT BRAIN REACTION TO A FACE A NAME A VOICE. WE WILL MAKE DECISIONS DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN A COURT OF LAW -- THE WONDERFUL THING IS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE NATURAL SCIENCES ACTUALLY LET US KNOW HOW TO CHANGE THOSE BRING REACTIONS. CUES CAN BE UTILIZED THAT WILL LOWER OUR LEVEL OF THREAT REACTION WHEN WE SEE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE APPEAR FIGHT MEAN THREATENING PERHAPS JUST INDIVIDUALS WHO. WHEN CONSIDERING THE OPTION OF INCARCERATION WE SAY WE NEED TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THEM AND AND THEREFORE PERHAPS PLACE THEM IN INCARCERATION? FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME [inaudible] ADDITIONALLY. NEUROSCIENCE HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHAT PRECISELY A JUDGE COULD DO. IN APPLYING LAW TO FACT. TO MAKE A FAIR DECISION EVEN IN THE FACE OF IMPLICIT BIAS. ASSUMING THAT IMPLICIT BIAS EXIST IN THE MIND OR THE BRAIN OF THAT JUDGE AT THAT TIME. CAN WE ACTUALLY TRAIN A JUDGE TO MAKE A FAIR DECISION BY ACTIVATING PARTICULAR PARTS OF THE NEUROANATOMY AND SUBSYSTEMS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO MAKE A DECISION THAT'S REALLY ABOUT THE FACTS AND THE LAW. AND THE ANSWER IS YES WE HAVE THAT AVAILABLE TO US AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLYHAVE THEIR BRAIN SCANNED IN THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER NEURO BIOLOGY CLASS OR THEIR FIRST ONE PERHAPS. IT ALL BECOMES A PART OF A PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN A CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT. OF THE MORE THAT WE DO THE MORE CONTROL THE JUDGE HAS AND QUIRK STAFF HAVE OVER THEIR BRAINS. MANY OF CONTROL OF THEIR BRAINS ABOUT CONTROL THEIR COURT. AND THEN WE HAVE A FAIR. SHERRI AND IN THE JUDITH PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO THE OUTCOMES WERE HOPING. FOR SO I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT. TRAINING IS MORE THAN HOLDING HANDS SINGING KUMBAYA. BUT RATHER IMPLEMENTING SPECIFIC MECHANISMS THAT CAN ALLOW US TO ENSURE THE FAIRNESS AND EQUITY OF THE COURTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU BUT ALLOW ONE OTHER WITNESS HER TESTIMONY. THE COURT JESTERS ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION THAT STILL GOING TO ADVISORY COMMITTEE PROCESS BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY SUPPORT OF WE WELCOME THE ASSEMBLY MORMONS -- INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE WITH A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WAS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE JUDGES WERE COUNCIL HAS INTEGRATED INTO OUR QUALIFIED ETHICS COURSE FOR JUDGES I BELIEVE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE CONTINUE TO WORK. ON THAT -- ON THE SUBJECT THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED WITH OUR PRESIDING JUDGE LEADERSHIP IN COURT EXECUTIVE OFFICER LEADERSHIP. A WORKING ON SOME OF THE MOMENT SO THAT'S BEEN NOT REALLY GREAT AND I WOULD JUST INTRODUCE BRIEFLY KAREEM ALTERADO WHO'S JOINED US HERE SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF OUR CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EDUCATION RESEARCH. AND SHE'S AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORK THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS DOING IN THIS AREA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD COME FOR JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE -- CARES WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. DANIEL SAVANNAH ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ALSO IN SUPPORT. CHRISTOPHER SONS THE CHAIR THAT WE JUST FROM THE POSITION LAST WEEK AND SUPPORT [inudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. HELLO MY NAME IS YOU WANTED TO CLIMB A AM A RESIDENT OF OAKLAND CALIFORNIA AND I WORK FOR EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY AND ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT BECAUSE I THINK THIS BILL IS CRITICAL. I CAPACITY THEY DO ACTUALLY ADMINISTER JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. I SAY NONE BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS REDRESS. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW THAT -- WHEN I VOLUNTEERED AS A TEMPORARY JUDGE WE HAD TO GO THROUGH TRAINING? AND ONE OF THOSE WAS ON IMPLICIT BIAS. AND YOU'RE RIGHT EVEN THOUGH YOU THINK YOU DON'T HAVE THAT BIAS IT IS THERE. AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND THEN TO FIGURE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT. BECAUSE IF YOU JUST TO GLOSS OVER AND SAY I HAVE NO BIAS AYE. I GREW UP IN A SOCIETY WHERE I EVERYBODY IS EQUAL. IT THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT WHEN YOU TAKE THOSE LITTLE TESTS AND YOU FIND THAT THERE IS AN IMPLICIT BIAS YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION. TO DETERMINE A SENTENCE OVER SOMEONE SO I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS THE PETRIE-NORRIS. I JUST ECHO AT MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS THIS IS SO IMPORTANT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU AS YOU MENTIONED TRAINING IS NOT JUST HOLDING HANDS AND SING KUMBAYA WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS AS SUCCESSFUL TRAINING PROGRAMS AND SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES IF YOU JUST. BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THAT VERY BRIEFLY CERTAINLY -- AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- NUMBER. ONE AWARENESS. STEP ONE ADMIT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM BASICALLY SO IT IS IMPORTANT FOR A PERSON TO BE AWARE BUT THAT WHILE IS IT IS NECESSARY IS ABSOLUTELY INSUFFICIENT. IT'S PART ONE BUT YOU GOTTA GO TO THE NEXT STEP THEN ONCE EVERYONE GETS TO THE POINT OF SAYING YES INDEED WE HAVE A BIAS. NOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND START UTILIZED TOOLS AND THE TOOL SHOULD COVER AT LEAST THREE CATEGORIES ONE REDUCING THE LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH WE KNOW CAN BE DONE. THAT THERE IS OUR ACTUAL CURRICULA AVAILABLE THAT WILL ACTUALLY BRING DOWN YOUR LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS ON THE I. A. T. IN ALMOST EVERY CATEGORY. SO THAT'S PART. ONE PART TWO PROVIDING THAT'S WHAT THAT'S LONG TERM MAINTENANCE PART TO PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH INSTANTANEOUS ACCESS TO BRING DOWN THE DIFFERENT NARAL PHYSIOLOGIC REACTIONS THAT CAN CREATE PROBLEMATIC DECISION MAKING. THE SPIDER SNAKE REACTION THAT WE HAVE IN OUR BRAIN WE CAN ACTUALLY ALSO HAVE TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WE'VE BEEN TOLD OVER LIFE TIME OR THE SCARY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE INCARCERATED LONGER. FIRST A SHORT OF FOR SHORTER PERIODS OF TIME AND NUMBER THREE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO ACTIVATE. THE SPECIFIC PARTS OF THEIR NEUROANATOMY THE ENTER YOUR SINGLE CORTEX TO BE SPECIFIC BUT NOT TO MAKE EVERYBODY'S EYES GLAZE OVER BUT TO PROTECT THE THE SPECIFIC PARTS OF THEIR NEUROANATOMY. THAT WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO MAKE FAIR AND ACCURATE DECISIONS EVEN WALL BIAS IS EXT IS ACTUALLY ACTIVE IN THEIR BRAIN AND IN THEIR PSYCHE SO TO SPEAK. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE COMPONENTS FOR PART TO THE SOLUTION SECTION AND PART ONE IS JUST THE PROBLEM AND A LOT OF TRIMMING STOP AT PORT ONE NOW YOU'RE ALL WE ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND DO GOOD. AND YET THE PERSON SITS THERE CONFUSED. THANK THANK THANK YOU WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GONNA GO TO SOMEONE ON ALL THESE FASCINATING AS IT IS BUT WE'RE WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE THE POLICY. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I I WILL GIVE A BRIEF PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ON MAY FOURTEENTH AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THIS ROOM THIS COMMITTEE. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NUMBER OF THE CAUCUSES IN THE ASSEMBLY ARE HOLDING HEARINGS ON DIVERSITY. IN THE ON THE BENCH DIVERSITY IN THE BARK IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IS A LACK OF DIVERSITY BOTH ON THE BENCH TO THE BAR AND THE TRACK OF STUDENTS COMING INTO LAW PROFESSOR AND I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US. TO OVERCOME THOSE BY SEES OR UNDERSTANDS. BREAK DOWN THE INTERNAL BY SEES IF WE DON'T HAVE A BENCH AT A BAR THAT LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA IT'S MUCH EASIER TO SORT OF HIDE BEHIND. TRADITIONAL NOTIONS AND TRADITIONAL STANDARDS SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA MOVING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE LEGAL PROFESSION THAT LOOKS AS MUCH LIKE CALIFORNIA AS WE CAN POSSIBLY GET IT. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SEEING NONE. MS KAMARCK LOVE YOU MAY CLOSE. I WILL JUST SAY IN AN EFFORT TO DE STRESS THE WORKPLACE AND IMPACT IMPLICIT BIAS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHOW. CHOW I CHIU GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN KALRA.

ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR MISTER GLORIA. YOU MADE YOUR BILL MORE MISS CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT A. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR TODAY. I TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR TIME ATTENTION. TO THIS BILL THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS THE CONSIDERATIONS BROUGHT BY MY OFFICE HAVE BEEN. BROUGHT TO MY OFFICE HAVE BENEFITTED THIS BILL IN THE TREMENDOUSLY THE MORNING THANK YOU HEY WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TEN TASTIC JUST VERY QUICKLY AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE PUBLIC AGENCIES TO RETAIN PUBLIC RECORDS. THAT ARE TRANSMITTED BY EMAIL FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS THIS WILL CLARIFY EXISTING PUBLIC RECORD RETENTION Là AND BRING IT INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. EMAILS OF COURSE AS YOU ON OUR CRITICAL CONDUCTING OUR DAILY BUSINESS I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SUGGEST THAT THEY'RE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT THE PAPER RECORDS. WE HAVE RECORDS WE HAVE -- EXPERIENCES -- IN MY HOME COUNTY -- OF LITIGATION AROUND THIS MATTER ARSENIO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT RECENTLY A CELL TO EXPENSIVE LAWSUIT AFTER THEY APPROVED A POLICY WOULD ALLOW FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF EMAILS AFTER -- IN MUCH LESS TIME THAN PROPOSED IN THIS BILL -- WITH ME THIS MORNING -- IS JIM YOUR COMPANY NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION AS OUR WITNESS. THANK YOU AND THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS YOU'RE TAKING THOSE AUTHORS DISTRICTS THANK YOU SO MUCH. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM YOU WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION -- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL -- WE THINK THAT THERE IS A NEED TO CREATE MINIMUM STANDARDS THAT APPLY STATEWIDE AND DON'T LEAVE IT UP TO THE DISCRETION OF EACH AGENCY IN AN AREA THAT IS SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR. WITH REGARD TO THE INFORMATION THAT HAS TO BE RETAINED. AS THE SOME LIMóN POINTED OUT THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHEN RECORDS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED -- THIRTY DAY PERIOD LET'S SAY -- THAT'S INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED BY THE PUBLIC TO LEARN ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY ABOUT HOW. SOMETHING IS SHAPED IN A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND WE STRONGLY YOUR DRIVER. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SEEN THAT IS THEIR OPPOSITION -- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE UNTIL GIVEN FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO THINK THE THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US IN AND TRYING TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL -- AT THIS TIME WE STILL BELIEVE IT'S A LITTLE TOO BROAD AND WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO US KEEPING. EVERY EMAIL THAT WE HAVE -- FOR TWO YEARS AND AND AGAIN THIS IS IN A THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW DISCLOSURES. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE -- PROVIDE ANY NEW EXEMPTIONS -- THIS IS A DATA STORAGE BILL THIS IS A WE HAVE TO KEEP -- THESE EMAILS AND AND THAT WOULD BE -- MEN EMAIL CHAIN WHERE YOU'VE GOT IN A FIFTEEN PEOPLE RESPONDING TO AN EMAIL IT'S NOT THE LAST EMAIL THAT HAS THE RECORD OF ALL OF THE EMAILS THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP. IT ALL OF THE FIFTEEN RESPONSES AS WELL. AND SO WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IS COST ARE A PUBLIC AGENCIES MORE MONEY AS FAR AS THE THE DATA STORAGE NOW. HI I APPRECIATE WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS GETTING AT AND I THINK THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY AND FIND SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION. ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES IS THIS -- RETENTION REQUIREMENT AS POINTED OUT THE ANALYSIS IS IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT RATHER THAN ANOTHER SECTION THE GOVERNMENT CODE. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT CIRCUMVENTS THE REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES THERE'S NO OTHER RETENTION REQUIREMENTS. IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THEIR OTHER PLACES IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE AND SO WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS IF IF IT'S GOING TO MOVE FORWARD BE MOVED FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. INTO THE GOVERNMENT COAT -- AND HOPEFULLY THAT THAT WILL ALLOW OUR AGENCIES THAT DO EXPERIENCE CERTAIN COSTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR YOUR REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE ABLE TO SEEK THOSE COSTS. AND WITH THAT -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THE MORNING ADJACENT BRIAN I'LL BE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR OR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS CONTINUES TO WORK WITH YOU OF MOVING FORWARD.

THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THERE'S THERE'S THIS GREAT NOTION OF OF WANTING TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO REPLACE. TRADITIONS AND AND LEGAL STRUCTURE THEY'VE BEEN BUILT UP OVER THE YEARS IN PAPER AND I'LL TELL YOU FOR ONE I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE PAPER. INTO ELECTRONICS AND AS WE DO THAT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING. THE IN THIS CASE THE INTENT OF THE THE CREATOR OF THE WILL AND THOSE PROCESS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE DO. SO THAT THE SYSTEM HAS A WAY TO TO MANAGE SO I I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD ISSUE I WANNA MAKE SURE WE FIND A WAY. TO ACCOMPLISH IS BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING -- BUT MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT THAT WE ARE PRESERVING THE EVIDENCE PRESERVING THE STRUCTURE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE CONCERN IS SO WE WE WILL GET THERE. THIS RACE. TO SHARE -- THAT CONCERNED -- MISTER CHAIR RIGHT BY I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WILL BE LIMITATIONS ON THIS AT A FUTURE DATE FOUR WHEELS OF PARTICULAR VALUE.

CERTAIN THAT THAT TO THE AUTHOR WILL BE LOOKING AT THE PROTECTIONS OF ALL OF THOSE. WHO WILL BE INVOLVED IN SUCH A WILL? THAT WILL BE SIGNED ELECTRONICALLY. MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPOND. PLACE YEAH BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE ARE THOSE -- ISSUES AND COMMENTS AND WE WOULD AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THIS IS WHY WE'VE TAKEN OUR TIME OVER THE LAST COUPE OF YEARS AND YEAH THIS IS A PLACE THAT MOVES VERY QUICKLY IN IN EVEN IN THIS% SITUATION WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE LONG ROAD IN. AND EVEN TABLE BILLS IN THE PAST WE CAN GET IT RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS IMPORTANT AND WE IN A WEEK KNOWLEDGE -- POTENTIAL ABUSES WHICH IS WHY WE'RE TAKING OUR TIME WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR HOPEFULLY WE GET DONE THIS YEAR I'M OPTIMISTIC -- BUT IF NOT WE'RE NOT LOOKING -- FOR SOME SORT OF RAM JOB ON THIS EITHER I MEAN WE WANT TO GET IT DONE RIGHT. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS IT'S AN EVERYDAY THAT MISTER SANTIAGO YES WE I THINK WE WE WILL DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO GET THIS SORTED OUT BUT IT'S GOOD. I THINK TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF EVERY SHAPE YOUR YOUR PATIENCE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BUT IN THE END I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A GREAT WORK PRODUCT. THAT REALLY SUPPORTS CALIFORNIANS. ALL RIGHT SEE NOTHING ELSE WAS UNDERGOING A CLOSE NOT RESPECT WESTERN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I CHAU. CHIU. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE I PETRIE-NORRIS. PETRIE-NORRIS I REYES HI RES SIDE. THE BILL IS OUT SICK THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER BLOOM THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY AB -- SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO ITEM. TWENTY SEVEN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND NOW FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. AB -- SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO IS A BILL THAT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE CLEAR CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT HOW CONSUMERS SHOULD PROPERLY DISPOSE OF SINGLE USE WET WIPES. PRODUCTS WITH THE ATTENTIVE KEEPING NON DISPERSIBLE WIPES OUT OF THE SEWER SYSTEM. BOB. THIS IS TOILET PAPER THAT WAS PLACED IN THIS JAR THIS MORNING AND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S ALREADY DISSOLVED INTO SMALL PIECES. THIS IS -- PERMISSION TO USE PROPS GRANTED. WITH YOUR PERMISSION MISTER CHAIR. YOU'RE JUST GONNA WANT TO HEAR THIS MISTER CHAIR -- THIS THIS IS -- TUG OF BOOZE KIDS WIPES -- YOU CAN SEE IT'S STILL IN ONE PIECE THIS WOULD PLACE THE JAR BACK IN FEBRUARY THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY OF OF OF THIS YEAR AND THAT IN CAPSULE IT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE WITH. WITH THIS BILL. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS RIGHT NOW ANY COMPANY CAN CALL THEIR PRODUCT FLUSHABLE REGARDLESS OF THE POTENTIAL HARM TO THE SEWER SYSTEM OR WHETHER IT. TRULY BREAKS APART -- OF LIKE TOILET PAPER DOES. WHEN AND WHAT WHITE PRODUCTS ARE FLUSHED INTO THE SEWER SYSTEM THAT CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS SEWER COLLECTIONS AND WASTE TREATMENT PLANTS AND IN FACT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING? OUT IN THE FIELD A SINGLE USE WET WIPES ARE HEAVIER THICKER AND HAVE LARGER SURFACE AREAS THAN TOILET PAPER AND RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS WHITE. MAINTAIN MOST OF THEIR STRENGTH AS THEY ARE COMPOSED OF SYNTHETIC FIBERS THAT RETAIN THEIR SHAPE AND STRENGTH. THEY OFTEN DO NOT BREAK DOWN -- FOR A LONG LONG TIME AFTER BEING FLUSHED AND CAN ACCUMULATE WITH FATS OILS AND GREASE. THAT BECOME LARGE OBSTRUCTIONS IN OUR PIPES AND TO HAVE EARNED THE DISGUSTING NAME OF FAT BERKS -- FURTHER DOWN THE LINE THEY WEAVE TOGETHER AND THEY CAN CREATE GIANT RAGS -- THAT -- THEN CAN'T CATCH IN OUR PUMP SYSTEMS COLLECTION SYSTEMS AND MOTORS CAUSING BACKUPS AND EQUIPMENT FAILURES AND THIS IN FACT IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED ACROSS THE STATE. I COULD GIVE YOU EXAMPLES IN PETALUMA AN ORANGE COUNTY -- IN THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF CAMERI -- A WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT IT HAS INVESTED A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO UPGRADE ITS WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT JUST TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. IN EACH OF THESE CASES THE COST GETS PASSED ON TO RATE PAYERS NOT THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE WHITES THAT ARE ACTUALLY DAMAGING THE SYSTEMS AND SO THIS BILL SIMPLY PRESCRIBES CLEAR AND CONSISTENT CONSUMER MESSAGING. FOR THESE PRODUCTS SO THAT CONSUMERS LEARN WHAT GOES DOWN THE TOILET AND WHAT DOESN'T -- AND THESE SHOULD NOT BE FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET IT'S IT'S THAT SIMPLE SO UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WIFE CAN BE LABELED AS FLUSHABLE IF THE IF THEY DO NOT CAUSE HARM TO THE SEWER SYSTEM. MEANING THAT MANUFACTURERS WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR WIVES CAN BREAK DOWN OF THE SEWER SYSTEM MUCH LIKE TRY TOILET PAPER FOR ALL OTHER WIPES THAT ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE FLUSHED. FELT BE MARKED DO NOT FLUSH IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT'S VERY LOGICAL. AND TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS JESSICA GALLAGHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HOW I'M JUST C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AUGER WITH CALIFORNIA&lt;/c&gt;</u> ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES WERE THE SPONSOR BABY SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO HERE TODAY AND STRONG SUPPORT. SINGLE USE WET WIPES THE BECOME WIDELY AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AND THERE'S A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH THE INCREASING POPULARITY. OF SINGLE USE WIPES PRODUCTS IN THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WE'RE SEEING IN THE SEWER SYSTEM WITH RAGGING. SOME MORE -- WIPES ARE MARKETED AS FLUSHABLE OTHERS ARE LABELED WITH DO NOT FLUSH DIRECTIONS OR NOT LABELED WITH ANY DISPOSAL INDICATIONS AT ALL. BECAUSE OF THIS INCONSISTENCY IN LABELING PRACTICES AND BECAUSE MOST OF THESE WIPES LOOK AND FEEL THE SAME. THE RESULT IS AN ONSLAUGHT OF WHITE SEEING FLUSHED DOWN THE DRAIN -- BOTH WIPES THAT ARE LABELED AS POSSIBLE IN THE ART AND THE CAUSING MAJOR ISSUES. FOR SEWER SERVICE PROVIDERS -- ONE WIPES GET INTO THE SYSTEM THEY WEAVE TOGETHER -- INFORMED LARGE BLANKETS AND WHEN THEY CATCH ON TO OTHER DEBRIS AND GREECE THEY FORM FAT BERKS. AND THESE ARE GIANT OBSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE MAJORLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE SYSTEM THINKING COST SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS. A SEWER SPILL OF ANY AMOUNT -- IS A PUBLIC AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD AND THE WATER BOARD HAS A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY FIRST BILLS. SO FAR IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE WATER BOARD'S BILL DATABASE INDICATES THAT THERE BEEN AT EIGHTY SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS ATTRIBUTED TO RAGGING AND NON DISPERSIBLE. THAT'S FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS -- IN THIS YEAR ALONE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OF WHICH REACH SURFACE WATERS AND WERE SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES. AND THAT NUMBER DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE OVERFLOW THAT PRIVATE RESIDENCES OR BUSINESSES THAT GO UNREPORTED. IN ADDITION TO OVERFLOWS ONE WIFE GET FURTHER DOWN IN THE SYSTEMS LARGE RAGS GET WRAPPED UP IN HEAVY MECHANICAL FEATURES OF THE SYSTEMS LIKE PUMPS. MOTORS AND SCREENS REQUIRING MANUAL REMOVAL OF DEBRIS AND ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE OR REPLACEMENT OF THE STRUCTURES. ON THE CONSTANT REMEDIATION EFFORTS TO DISRUPT ALL STAGES OF TREATMENT THE TREATMENT PROCESS AND AS A RESULT -- AT RESULTING COSTS ON MANY LEVELS FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND ULTIMATELY ON REPAIRS -- ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT MANY WIPES LIKE BABY WIPES AND CLEANING WIPES ARE MADE OF PLASTIC AND WHEN THEIR FLESH IMPROPERLY THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE. TO LOADING MY IN WASTEWATER EFFLUENT -- THERE SIGNIFICANT TIME ENERGY ND PUBLIC MONEY BEING SPENT ON MASSIVE PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH FLUSHING WIPES. PRETTY MUCH EVERY AGENCY HAS DONE OUT REACH ABOUT WIPES FOR MANY YEARS AND WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN SIMPLY AREN'T EFFECTIVE ENOUGH AND MANAGING THIS PROBLEM. WE RECENTLY DID SOME POLLING ON THIS ISSUE IN THE BAY AREA AND BY A LARGE MARGIN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT CONSUMERS TRUST THE LABELING ON PACKAGES. AND THAT'S THE PREFERRED METHOD FOR RECEIVING INFORMATION ABOUT PROPER DISPOSAL OF THESE PRODUCTS. FAR AND ABOVE HEARING ABOUT IT FROM THEIR LOCAL SEWER UTILITY. ON THE PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR FLEXIBILITY IN THE BILL ARE BASED ON SCIENCE AND ACCURATELY REFLECT THE CONDITIONS IN THE SEWER ESPECIALLY THE SYSTEMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S LESS TURBULENCE BECAUSE THE SUCCESSFUL WATER CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THE MEASURES WERE DEVELOPED BY AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PUBLIC WASTE WATER ENTITIES USING A SCIENTIFIC AN EVIDENCE BASED PROCESS WITH FEEDBACK FROM THE NON WOVEN FABRICS INDUSTRY. THE DO NOT FLESHLY BAND LABELING REQUIREMENT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY GUIDELINES THAT MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS ALREADY ABIDE BY. THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS ARE REFLECTIVE OF OTHER SOURCE CONTROL LEGISLATION AND WE SHEET THE AMENDMENTS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT EXTEND OUT THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD TO GIVE MANUFACTURERS TIME TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE -- BOTTOM LINE WE'VE SPENT MANY YEARS -- PROVIDING FEEDBACK TO THE MANUFACTURERS OF WET WIPES ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING. AND SUGGESTING CHANGES TO LABELING GUIDELINES WITH LITTLE SUCCESS SO WE FEEL IT'S TIME TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND THAT REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE CLEAR CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE DISPOSAL OF THESE PRODUCTS. IS A SENSIBLE AND MODERATE APPROACH SO FOR THESE REASONS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEES I BUT WE HAVE CHAIRED BOSS GOAL OF A KATHY HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL FEEDBACK IF NECESSARY AS WELL. AND A MISTER CHAIR I NEGLECTED TO OF ACTION OF THE TOTAL EXCEPT OF THE AMENDMENT SAID THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU RIGHT ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

BORN COMMON SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING A CHAIR STONE IN MEMBERS CURSOR IS ON BEHALF OF INTO THE ASSOCIATION FOR NON WOVEN FABRICS INDUSTRY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY ON SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO OUR INDUSTRY IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUE IMPROVING OUR WIPES PRODUCTS TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF CONSUMERS WHILE MINIMIZING THE IMPACTS. OF WASTE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO THAT END THE ONLY VIABLE SOLUTIONS TO THE PERSISTENT ISSUE OF WASTE WATER SYSTEM CLOGS. COME FROM SYSTEM STUDIES AND WHAT TRIBES CONSUMER DISPOSABLE BEHAVIOR WE'VE ALL SEEN THE PICTURES OF THE BIG UGLY CLOGS PULLED OUT OF SYSTEMS. MANY SUCH PICTURES APPEAR TO INVOLVE WIPES OR RACKING MATERIAL THAT ARE WIDELY REPORTED AS FLUSHABLE WIPES. HOWEVER AFTER SEVERAL FORENSIC ANALYSES OF ACCUMULATIONS AND CLOGS IN THE UNITED STATES AND U. K. MUNICIPAL SYSTEMS WE KNOW THAT MOSTLY THIS IS. A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY. THESE WASTEWATER COLLECTION STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE FLASHING OF NON FLUSHABLE SUCH AS BABY WIPES SURFACE WIPES AND SANITARY PIPES ARE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE OF THE CLOGS IN THE SEWER SYSTEMS NOT FLUSHABLE WIPES FOR EXAMPLE. A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN NEW YORK CITY ADMINISTERED BY AN INDEPENDENT ENGINEERING FIRM AT THE REQUEST OF NEW YORK CITY LAW DEPARTMENT FOUND FLUSHABLE WIPES WHERE THE SMALLEST CATEGORY OF MATERIALS COLLECTED AT 2%. THIS SHOWS THAT THE IN THE FLESH ABILITY GUIDELINES FOR FLUSHABLE WIPES ACTUALLY WORK AS INTENDED AND THAT FLUSHABLE WIPES ARE NOT THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM CONTRARY TO THE STATED PURPOSE OF AB. SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO THE UNITED KINGDOM STUDY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY WATER U. K.. HOW YOU SIMILAR PROTOCOLS AND COLLECTED AND ANALYZED MORE THAN FIFTY CLOGS IN PUMPS SEWER BLOCKAGES AND WASTE WATER TREATMENT IN LET SAMPLES OVER A PERIOD OF MORE THAN TWO MONTHS? UPON COMPLETION RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT FLUSHABLE WIPES ACCOUNTED FOR A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF IDENTIFY MATERIAL MACHINE LABEL OF BABYSURFACE AND OTHER WIPES IDENTIFIED AS THE PROBLEM IN PRIMARY STUDIES. THE BILL'S PRIMARY FOCUS ON ONE CATEGORY OF FLUSHABLE WIPES ACTUALLY DESIGNED AND ENGINEERED TO BE SAFE THE FLASH IS A QUESTIONABLE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM. FOR THIS REASON WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON CAP KEEP Q. CAP CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO WITH RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. OUR OPPOSITION IS BASED AS WELL ON THE FORENSIC ANALYSES AS REFERENCED -- BY AND THEY CHAU FLUSHABLE WIPES OR NOT INDEED THE CHIEF CONTRIBUTORS TO THESE CLOGS -- AND THEREFORE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO ADDRESSES ARE THE PROBLEM. A RECENT COLLABORATION BETWEEN INDUSTRY IN THE JACKSONVILLE ELECTRIC AUTHORITY WASTE WATER SYSTEM IN JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA IN MARCH OF JUST THIS YEAR FOUND THAT BOTH WASTE WATER AND INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES WORK TOGETHER TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE MATERIALS. FROM THREE SEPARATE SETS OF BAR SCREEN SAMPLES OVER A TWO DAY PERIOD. ONCE AGAIN FLUSHABLE WIPES AND NOT STUDY FOUND TO OUGHT TO BE LESS THAN 1% OF THE MATERIAL COLLECTED AND ANALYZED. COLLECTION STUDIES USING FORENSIC ANALYSES IN PORTLAND MAINE AND WE'RE A CALIFORNIA SIMILARLY SHOWED FLUSHABLE WIPES REPRESENT ONLY A SMALL PORTION. OF MATERIALS COLLECTED AND IDENTIFIED. AND NOTED -- BY THE PROPONENTS I DOUBT IT WAS REFERENCE -- TO FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE WATER. RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOW REDUCTION PROGRAM WHICH ALSO NOTABLY DESPITE THE NUMBERS MENTIONED IS JUST REPRESENTS JUST A DE MINIMUS AMOUNT OF THE KIND OF THOSE ISSUES AS REPORTED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD'S OWN DATA. AND ILLUSTRATES AT THE END OF FLEXIBILITY STANDARDS ARE INDEED WORKING WELL. NOT DOT APPEARS THAT OUT. FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE FIELD STUDIES IN FORENSIC ANALYSES AS WELL AS THE STATE'S DATA COMBINED SHOW THE END OF FLEXIBILITY GUIDELINES TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR PROTECTING MUNICIPAL WASTE WATER SYSTEMS. THIS IS WHY COUNTRIES SUCH AS SPAIN BELGIUM NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY ARE STEADILY INCREASING KEY STANDARDS RATHER THAN THE FAULTY STANDARDS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED -- IN THIS BILL. THE BILL STANDARDS OF FASHION EFFECTIVELY BANNED FLUSHABLE WIPES IN CALIFORNIA BASICALLY ALL FLUSHABLE WIPES CURRENTLY ON THE U. S. MARKET A PRODUCT WHEN WE SPUR SYSTEMS STUDIES AND STATES DATA TO NOT BE A PROBLEM. WE WOULD ASK THE PROPONENTS WHY CHOOSING A BAND OF WHAT IS NO MORE THAN 2% OF THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN COMMITTING TO A TARGETED STRATEGY ON 98% OF THE PROBLEM. IS THE DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED UP WITH THE FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NEW VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THE SEARCH AREA THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MORNING SHARING COMMITTEE ADAM REGULAR AND AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ALIGN WITH SEEM TA AND I NDA WERE OPPOSED THANKS THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS -- ON MY VERY MANY LEE ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS CANCEL ANY OUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. PRICING THAT MISTER BLOOM -- PROPS YOU CAN ADDRESS THE SERVICE THEY MISS THE OPPOSITION. SMITH GOVERNOR TO DO THAT OF COURSE SO -- I THINK THERE'S JUST A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT ON THE RESEARCH -- HERE -- THAT WE FEEL THAT THE RESEARCH THAT THE INDUSTRY PRESENTS AS SOMEWHAT FLAWED AND WE OBJECT TO MANY OF THE KLUTE CONCLUSIONS IT IS BOTH THE FLUSHABLE. AND NON FLUSHABLE WIPES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEMS -- IN THE SYSTEMS AND FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND WE ALSO KNOW BASED ON SOME FIELD STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE SPECIFIC TO THE FLUSHABLE WIPES CATEGORY -- THAT WHEN WE DROP -- A VARIETY OF FLUSHABLE WIPES INTO THE SYSTEM THEY DO COME THROUGH INTACT SOME OF THE WIPES ARE HIGH PERFORMERS AND THEY COME THROUGH AND DISPERSE BUT OF A LARGE AMOUNT DO COME THROUGH AND TAX SO THAT TELLS US THAT AND THEY ARE NOT PERFORMING -- THE WAY THAT THEIR INTENDED TO PERFORM AND THAT'S A STUDY DONE IN A FIELD OUTSIDE OF THE LABORATORY SETTING SO WE KNOW THAT -- THEY ARE MAKING IT -- THROUGH THE SYSTEM SO -- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE WHOLE SUITE OF PRODUCTS BY ADDRESSING LABELING OF BOTH THE NON FLUSHABLE. AND FLUSHABLE MARKETED -- WHAT WHITE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT THIS WILL BE MY CLOSE. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE THE MOST -- NOW LOOKING FOR A MOTION. THANK YOU AND THE SECOND MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHAU. CHIU.

THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER BILL OF RIGHTS MS CARILLO YOU HAVE TO BILLS WORTH. YEAH GIVE A PREFERENCE FOR WHICH YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE UP FIRST. RIGHT LET'S START WITH ITEM NUMBER SIX THEN AB. SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT MORNING GOOD MORNING. HELLO GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT A BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE UNLAWFUL WORKPLACE PAID DIFFERENCES. FOR EMPLOYEES OF ALL GENDERS OUR CURRENT EQUAL PAY INSURERS THAT EMPLOYEES OF DIFFERENT GENDER RACE AND ETHNICITY THROUGH PERFORM SIMILAR WORK ARE PAID FAIRLY. THE LAW ALSO DISCOURAGES PAY SECRECY BY PROHIBITING RETALIATION OR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES WHO DISCUSS THEIR INCOME. AB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT THREATENS OUR FAIR PAY ACT BY REMOVING THE GENDER BINARY TERMINOLOGY THE US INCORPORATING. NON BINARY PEOPLE INTO THESE PROTECTIONS AND CLARIFYING THAT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED. THIS BILL ALSO SPECIFIES THAT ONE THE WORKER FILING A CLAIM AS ONLY ESTABLISHED THAT THEY WERE PAID LESS THAN A SINGLE EMPLOYEE OF ANOTHER SEX OR RACE. AND TO WORKERS HAVE A ONE YEAR OF A FILING DEADLINE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE RETALIATION CLAIMS LIKE THEY DO FOR CIVIL RETALIATION CLAIMS. WHILE GENDER NON CONFORMING AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS OCCUPIED OUR WORKPLACE THEY HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN LEGALLY RECOGNIZED OR PROTECTED. THESE PROTECTIONS ARE NECESSARY AS SHOWN IN THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR TRANSGENDER EQUALITY SURVEY WHICH REPORTED THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE TRANS GENDER RESPONDENTS REPORTED BEING FIRED. DENIED A PROMOTION OR MISTREATED BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER. ADDITIONALLY WORKERS HAVE ONE YEAR TO FILE A CIVIL RETALIATION COMPLAINING PORTS UNDER THE EQUAL PAY ACT. BUT SIX MONTHS TO FILE ADMINISTRATIVE RETALIATION CLAIMS WE MUST PROVIDE THE SAME FILING DEADLINES REGARDLESS OF WHICH ROUTE A WORKER CHOOSES TO PURSUE. HERE TO TESTIFY IS TAMMY MARTIN LEGISLATIVE MANAGER OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA JESSICA STERN -- WHO IS A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES? AND HER CLIENT CAROL HANDED. THANK YOU THANK WORST WITNESS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TAMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE LGBTQ CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AND PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WHICH REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S RESPECT FOR ITS DIVERSE POPULATION. AND UPDATES THE OUTDATED IT GENDER BINARY LANGUAGE IN THE STATE'S EQUAL PAY ACT. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE SPONSORED THE GENDER RECOGNITION ACT WHICH ENABLED MORE PEOPLE TO OBTAIN A STATE ISSUED IDENTITY DOCUMENTS THAT ACCURATELY. REFLECT THEIR GENDER IDENTITY BY CREATING A THIRD NON BINARY GENDER MARKER. AND THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA'S EQUAL PAY ACT. PROHIBITS EMPLOYERS FROM PAYING AN EMPLOYEE LESS THAN AN EMPLOYEE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX FOR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK SO AB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WILL UPDATE THIS OUTDATED BINARY LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES OF ALL. GENDERS AND GENDER EXPRESSIONS ARE PAID EQUITABLY. AND WE KNOW THAT LGBT Q. PEOPLE AND TRANS GENDER AND NON BINARY PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR HAVE HISTORICALLY FACED HIGH LEVELS OF SOCIETAL STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION. A RECENT STUDY REVEALED PATTERNS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST TRANSGENDER NON BINARY PEOPLE IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS INCLUDING WORK PLACES. ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE RESPONDENTS REPORTED BEING FIRED TONIGHT A PROMOTION OR OTHERWISE BEING MISTREATED AT WORK BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION. AND THIS PERPETUATES THE CYCLE OF ECONOMIC INSTABILITY FOR TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY CALIFORNIANS ONE THIRD OF WHOM LIVE IN POVERTY. EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT IS A THOUGHTFUL UNNECESSARY UPDATE TO EQUAL PAY LAWS AND WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR ADVANCING THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION. AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA CENTER AND I'M AN ATTORNEY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES -- WE EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO MAKE THE FILING TIME LINES CONSISTENT FOR FILING A RETALIATION CLAIM IN COURT -- OR pTO THE LIMITATIONS THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE IN FINDING A LAWYER TO ACTUALLY BRING UP RETALIATION CLAIM IN COURT WITHOUT ALTERNATE TO OUR CLIENT CORAL HAND IN -- TO SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUE THE THANKS WITH THIS PLEASE. A GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WHICH WAS A PROVIDE IMPORTANT UPDATES AND CLARIFICATIONS TO OUR STATE EQUAL PAY LAW. I WORKED FOR A MAJOR GOLF COURSE BEACH RESORT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AS A ROTATIONAL MANAGER. IN THAT POSITION I WORKED AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS AT THE RESORT ON A ROTATIONAL BASIS. THE TIME THAT I WORKED THERE I WORKED HARD I DID MY JOB WELL AND I RECEIVED POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND EVALUATIONS FOR MY SUPERVISORS. AFTER A LITTLE OVER A YEAR WORKING THERE. I CAME ACROSS A DOCUMENT A SHARED SERVER THAT LISTED THE SALARIES OF ALL THE MANAGERS. AND REFLECTED DISPARITIES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE MANAGERS WITH THE MEN RECEIVING HIGHER WAGES. I IMMEDIATELY INFORM MY SUPERVISOR THAT IT COME ACROSS THE DOCUMENT IN THE OFFICES DIGITAL FILES AND GIVEN. THAT IT HAD SENSE OF WAGE INFORMATION I THOUGHT IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE PASSWORD PROTECTED. I ALSO RAISE THE GENDER GENDER WAGE DISPARITIES THAT REFLECTED IN THE DOCUMENT WITH HR. AS FAR AS I KNOW NO CHANGES IN PAY WERE MADE AFTER A REPORTED THE PAY. DISPARITIES A FEW MONTHS LATER I DECIDED TO TAKE ANOTHER JOB BECAUSE IT PAID MORE. DURING MY EXIT INTERVIEW THE H. WAS LEAVING I TOLD HER THAT I LOVE MY JOB. AND THAT THE REASON I WAS LEAVING WAS THAT I WAS BEING PAID TOO LITTLE AND BECAUSE OF THE PAY DISPARITIES THAT I HAD SEEN IN THE DOCUMENT. NATURE REPRESENTATIVE THEN TOLD ME THAT MY SUPERVISOR WAS NO VERY UPSET WITH ME FOR HAVING RAISE THE ISSUE OF PAY. I EXPLAINED THAT I HADN'T ACTED WITH ANY MALICE. I'D SIMPLY REPORTED THE ISSUE TO HR BECAUSE THEY FELT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THE NEW JOB DIDN'T WORK OUT AS I HAD HOPED SO AFTER A FEW MONTHS I'VE APPLIED FOR SEVERAL OPEN POSITIONS WITH MY FORMER EMPLOYER I WAS ALREADY TRAINED AND HAD EXPERIENCE IN ALL OF THE POSITIONS THAT I APPLIED. HOWEVER AFTER MONTHS OF WAITING AND THE POSITIONS STILL BEING OPEN. I DID NOT HEAR BACK ABOUT ANY OF MY APPLICATIONS. I WAS CONFUSED AND UPSET BECAUSE I HAD BEEN A GREAT EMPLOYEE I FELT A TO HANDLE THE SITUATION PROFESSIONALLY. BY REPORTING TO PAY PROBLEM THAT I DISCOVERED. MY FORMER SUPERVISOR HAD EMAILED ME PRIOR TO MY DEPARTURE SAYING THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME ME BACK IF THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY DIDN'T WORK OUT. IT WAS CLEAR TO ME EVENTUALLY BUT THEY WERE NOT CONTACTED ME ABOUT THE OPEN POSITIONS BECAUSE I HAD RATES RAISE THE ISSUE OF EQUAL PAY. APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONTHS AFTER I FIRST RE APPLIED TO WORK FOR THE COMPANY. I FILED A WAGE CLAIM AND RETALIATION CLAIM UNDER THE EQUAL PAY ACT WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. AN INVESTIGATOR CONTACTED ME ABOUT THE EQUAL PAY CLAIM BUT I WAS NOT CONTACTED ABOUT THE RETALIATION CLAIM. DESPITE MAKING REPEATED INQUIRIES. I FINALLY LEARNED THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HAD DISMISSED MY RETALIATION CLAIM. ON THE GROUNDS THAT WAS FILED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER THE END OF MY EMPLOYMENT. I FILED AN APPEAL ON THE GROUNDS OF THE DEADLINE FOR THE RETALIATION CLAIM IS ONE YEAR AS MY STATS AS STATED IN THE STATUTE I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY RESPONSE FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. ABOUT MY APPEAL OF THE RETALIATION DISMISSAL DESPITE REACHING OUT MULTIPLE TIMES. FINALLY THE INVESTIGATOR WHO IS INVESTIGATING MY EQUAL PAY CLAIM TOLD ME THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WAS UNABLE TO RE OPEN THE CLAIM AND THEN I COULD REACH OUT TO THE RETALIATION PUBLIC LINE FOR MORE INFORMATION. I SENT MULTIPLE REQUESTS AND RETALIATION PUBLIC LINE BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD BACK ONCE. I FILE MAKE IT WILL PLAY AND RETALIATION CLAIMS WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND A LAWYER. AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FILE A LAWSUIT ON MY OWN. I THINK WORKERS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO FILE A RETALIATION CLAIM WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. AS THEY HAVE TO FILE IN COURT. IT WORKERS ABILITY TO FIND A LAWYER AND FILE A LAWSUIT SHOULD NOT DICTATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT SHE HAS TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR BEING RETALIATED AGAINST. AB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WOULD CLARIFY THAT THE FILING DEADLINE FOR THESE CLAIMS IS THE SAME REGARDLESS OF THE FORM AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT MY SITUATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IF YOU ARE ON THE TOP OF THE THERE'S ASSOCIATION PART BECAUSE ONCE AS OF THIS BILL ARCHER SUPPORT.

CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND WHY THAT'S NECESSARY [inaudible] HI. SO -- THE LONGSTANDING INTERPRETATION OF THE BOTH FEDERAL EQUAL PAY ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA EAGLE PACK WHICH HAS BEEN MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL EQUAL PAY ACT IS THAT A SINGLE EMPLOYEE USE BRING ANY CO PACK LAID NEEDS ONLY TO FIND. ONE COMPARATOR -- I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S REFLECTED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE CASE LAW THAT THAT THAT SUPPORTS THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF NEED ONLY -- ONE COMPARED OR EMPLOYEE -- THE STATUTE ITSELF HAS A SEVEN POISONS OR MERELY CLARIFYING IT TO SAY NGUYEN PLEASE SINGULAR TO REFLECT WHAT THE CASE LAWS WERE HAS HAS HELD FOR MANY YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU SO I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE GENDER IDENTITY PORTIONS OF THAT WATER IDEA IN SUPPORT IF THAT WAS IN THERE.

SEVENTEEN FIFTY THREE A BILL THAT INSURANCE IMMIGRANTS ONLY RECEIVE A HIGHLY IMPORTANT LEGAL ADVICE FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE LEGAL EDUCATION AND EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE SUCH ASSISTANCE. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF AGAIN FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS ANALYSIS I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED ON PAGE TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS AT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE I. C. A. REGULATES INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PROVIDE WHO PROVIDE IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE. AND ARE NEITHER ATTORNEYS NOR ACCREDITED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE I EE A AUTHORIZES IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS TO COMPLETE IMMIGRATION FORMS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS BUT PROHIBITS THEM PROVIDE FROM PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE OR REPRESENTING CLIENTS. IN AN IMMIGRATION COURT IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FEDERAL POLICY WAS MODIFIED THAT PUTS IMMIGRANTS AT A GREATER RISK OF DEPORTATION BY ALLOWING OFFICIALS TO START THE DEPORTATION PROCESS. FOR TO NIGHT IMMIGRATION PETITIONS AND TO REFER CASES TO THE IMMIGRATIONS. AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ICE NO CRIMINAL OR SECURITY GROUNDS. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO MY DISTRICT BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS NEARLY 35% OF LA COUNTY. TEN MILLION RESIDENTS WERE BORN IN ANOTHER COUNTRY MYSELF INCLUDED. ESTIMATES FURTHER INDICATE THAT APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IMMIGRANTS LIVE IN LA COUNTY. MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN OUR STATE. FOR THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES HIRING AND IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS OFTEN COST LESS THAN HIRING AND AN ATTORNEY. BUT THE RISK OF POTENTIAL DEPORTATION AND THE DENIAL OF CITIZENSHIP OR RESIDENCY INVOLVING HIRING A LOWER COST IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT. FAR OUTWEIGHS THE COST BENEFIT. THE CURRENT EXPANDED DISCRETION OF FEDERAL OFFICIALS TO DENY IMMIGRATION APPLICATIONS LEAVES NO ROOM FOR ERROR. IN THE ACCURACY SUBMISSION AND COMPLETENESS OF IMMIGRATION APPLICATIONS. AND E. IN OF ERRORS CAN BE RECTIFIED. AFFECTED IMMIGRANT VICTIMS OFTEN LACK THE ABILITY TO CORRECT THESE MISTAKES. BE IT FOR LACK OF RESOURCES FEAR OF RETALIATION OR A VERY REAL DISTRUST OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT THIS MOMENT. AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY THREE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY MAKING IT UNLAWFUL FOR A PERSON OTHER THAN A LICENSED ATTORNEY OR A PERSON. OR ORGANIZATION FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED TO REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS IN IMMIGRATION MATTERS TO PROVIDE IMMIGRATION RELATED SERVICES FOR A FEE AND CALIFORNIA. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CHASE OF NIKITA DIRECTOR OF THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS. WHO HAVE ASK IS PROFESSOR OF SOUTHWESTERN SCHOOL OF LAW AND DANIEL SHARP THE LEGAL DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN RESOURCE CENTER TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE? I THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M WE HAVE THAT FAITH ASSOCIATE CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF LAW AT SOUTHWESTERN LAW SCHOOL. I'VE DEDICATED MY CAREER TO TEACHING IMMIGRATION LAW AND PRACTICING IMMIGRATION LAW ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX AREAS OF US LAW. THE TIME HAS COME TO OVERHAUL THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS ACT WHICH WAS PASSED OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO UNDER A VERY DIFFERENT IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. UNDER TODAY'S IMMIGRATION LAWS MOST UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS DO NOT QUALIFY FOR RELIEF. I OFTEN IS THIS IMMIGRANTS WHO'VE ALREADY FALLEN VICTIM TO IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS DECEPTIVE AN UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICES. IMMIGRANTS ARE OFTEN AN UNDERSTANDABLY CONFUSED BY THE TERM IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT. AND THEY'RE OFTEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE TERM DENOTES A FORM OF EXPERTISE IN IMMIGRATION LAW. CONSEQUENCES OF IT IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT FILING A BOTCHED OR ILL ADVISED APPLICATION ARE DEVASTATING. THEY CAN INCLUDE IMMIGRANTS BEING PLACED IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS AND POSSIBLY DETENTION. SURELY BE SIX ARE TOO HIGH. FOR MERELY A BONDS AND A BACKGROUND CHECK WHICH IS THE LOW BAR UNDER THE CURRENT ACT. IMMIGRATION FORM PREPARATION IS NO LONGER A SIMPLE SERVICE AND IT REQUIRES LEGAL ADVICE. I RECENTLY CONDUCTED A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT US IMMIGRATION FORMS COMMONLY FILED BY IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS I FOUND THAT ONLY ONE FORM A SHORT HALF PAGE CHANGE OF ADDRESS FORM. CAN ACCURATELY BE COMPLETED WITH OUT THE PROVISION OF LEGAL ADVICE. SOMETHING WHICH IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS CAN NOT STATUTORILY PROVIDE. YES IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS ROUTINELY IGNORE THESE LIMITS AND PLACE IMMIGRANTS AT RISK. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DIVORCE IMMIGRATION FORM PREPARATION FROM THE PROVISION OF LEGAL ADVICE. AND CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD NO LONGER SANCTION A SYSTEM THAT IGNORES THIS REALITY. THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS ACT IT'S OUTDATED AND PLACES IMMIGRANTS AT E. WEBER BOWL RISK. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY THREE AND CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S ADMIRABLE PATH OF PROTECTING ITS IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE GOOD MORNING MR CHEN MEMBERS JONI KEYED ON BEHALF OF THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS CO SPONSOR. OF AB. SEVENTEEN FIFTY THREE I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS MY DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING OVER TEN MILLION CONSUMERS IN LA COUNTY. AND SUPPORTING BUSINESSES TO CREATE A FAIR AND THRIVING MARKET PLACE I WANT TO THANK MEMBER CREEL FOR ADVANCING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AND THINK PROFESSOR VASQUEZ FOR HER TESTIMONY IN AS THE CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS THIS IS ALSO PERSONALLY IMPORT FOR ME AS WELL. YOU'VE JUST HEARD HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR IMMIGRANTS TO NAVIGATE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND AGAINST THIS BACKDROP. AND BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE IN LA COUNTY THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT ACT IS BAD FOR CONSUMERS. MOST CONSUMERS ENGAGE IN IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT BECAUSE THEY NEED SUBSTANTIVE HELP THEY MAY HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OF WHAT THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE. LIKE GETTING A GREEN CARD BUT THEY WON'T KNOW HOW TO HAD IT THEY ONE OF THE QUALIFY THEY WON'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT APPLYING -- WHAT FORMS TO FILL OUT A WHAT PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW? UP BUT FOR GOOD REASON THE I. C. FOR BIDS A CONSULTANT FROM PROVIDING THAT SUBSTANTIVE HELP AND THIS PUTS THE CONSULTANT. IN THE UNTENABLE POSITION OF LETTING CONSUMERS GAS AND HOW TO PROCEED OR ATTEMPTING TO GUIDE WERE ADVISED THE CONSUMER IN VIOLATION OF THE I SEE A BOTH OF WHICH COULD HAVE CATASTROPHIC OUTCOMES FOR THE CONSUMER. SOME OF OUR DATA FROM LA COUNTY BEARS THIS OUT. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE MY DEPARTMENT HAS LOGGED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED COMPLAINTS INVOLVING IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRD AND SEVENTY LAST YEAR ALONE. I'VE HEARD IT SAID THE COMPLAINTS TYPICALLY INVOLVE CONSULTANTS WHO ARE NOT BONDED UNDER THE ICY BUT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT. OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE COUNTY. OUR DATA SHOWS UP FOR CONSULTANTS WHO HAD FOUR OR MORE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEM INTO A SINCE TWENTY TWELVE IN OTHER WORDS THE REPEAT OFFENDERS. UP 55% OF THOSE WERE OR ARE BONDED AT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE I. CA ONE SUCH CONSULTANT HAD OVER EIGHTY THREE COMPLAINTS HIMSELF ALONG WITH OUR DEPARTMENT BUT HE HAD HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS COME FORWARD -- WHEN IT CASES BROUGHT AGAINST THEM? SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LA COUNTY DA HAS CHARGED NUMEROUS IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS OF VARIOUS CRIMES THEY VICTIMIZE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO COLLECTIVELY LOST OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S JUST THE LA COUNTY DA DOES REFLECT OTHER. PROSECUTING. LOOK WE'VE TRIED TO AMENDED THE I SEE A AT LEAST ELEVEN TIMES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WITH OVER THIRTY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. GET COMPLAINTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR IMMIGRANTS ATTORNEYS AND FEDERALLY ACCREDITED NONPROFITS WHO CAN HELP. AND I ALSO IN CLOSING WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE THE NOTION THAT IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS PROVIDE LOW COST ALTERNATIVES TO ATTORNEYS. THAT'S REALLY AN APPLES TO ORANGES COMPARISON IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS CANNOT PROVIDE. THE LEGAL ADVICE NEEDED TO HELP CONSUMERS IN TODAY'S IMMIGRATION LANDSCAPE EVEN SMALL ERRORS ON WAS PERCEIVED AS A ROUTINE MATTER. COULD HAVE SOME SERIOUS ADVERSE OUTCOMES AS REFLECTED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS OF WHAT THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR YES VOTE. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US WITH.

TRY TO PREVIOUSLY DO BILLS IN THE SPACE TO TIGHTEN THINGS UP. I'M JUST KIND OF A DISTURBED OKAY CURIOUS WHY THE NATIONAL NOTARY ASSOCIATION IS INVOLVED IN THIS DISCUSSION. SO A PORTION OF OUR NOTARIES ARE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS AND IN THERE IN LIES THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BATTLE FOR DECADES. I I REPRESENT A BORDER COMMUNITY AND THE TERM NOBODY ALL. IN SPANISH IS VERY IT MEANS VERY DIFFERENT THINGS I I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THE BUSINESS OF NOTARIES OUT OF THE IMMIGRATION BUSINESS BECAUSE THE CONFUSION THAT HAS CAUSED IN THE COMMUNITY OVERT THAT SIMPLE WORD AND WE HAVE TRIED TO LEGISLATE THIS -- IS SHOCKING AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD NO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO SUGGEST WERE ANYTHING BUT NOTARIES AND YET HERE THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION IS HIGHLY. INVOLVED IN OPPOSING THIS BILL WHEN -- AS I UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF NOTARIES ARE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY IT AND WE'RE NOT -- I'M AWARE OF THAT REASON I THINK EVERYBODY HERE I KNOW I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET PAPERS NOTARIZED BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE TERM NOBODY -- HISTORICALLY IN OUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN USED TO PULL PEOPLE. INTO BELIEVING THAT THE HELP THAT THEY'RE GETTING IS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF HEALTH I'M SORRY WE WILL NOT TAKE. I COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE AT THIS POINT PLEASE RESPECT MS GONZALEZ AND QUITE READY. I LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY AND AFTER BILL AFTER BILL AFTER BILL WHEN WE HAVE TRIED TO TIGHTEN THIS UP YOU CAN GO DOWN DOWN THE STREET AND SEE YOU CAN SEE THE ADS IN THE NEWSPAPER YOU CAN SEE. THE CROSS BORDER ADDS THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL SO. SO I AM SORRY PLEASE WE WILL NOT TAKE OUTBURST FROM THE AUDIENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MOVING FORWARD THE UTILIZATION OF IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS UNDER AN ATTORNEY TO PROVIDE HELP TO AN ATTORNEY IN IN A KIND OF PARA LEGAL SENSE. BUT NOT ACTING ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN WITH WHEN I INITIALLY DID A BILL ON THIS AND AND MISC CARILLO I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS. IN MY OWN OFFICE IN MY OWN ASSEMBLY OFFICE WE HAVE EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF MY DISTRICT OFFICE HAD A STORY ABOUT THEIR OWN FAMILIES PROBLEMS WITHIN IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT. THIS IS NOTHING THAT IS NEW. TO OUR COMMUNITY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED TODAY AYE AYE. I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO A GOOD SERVICE FOR COMMUNITY I DON'T THINK YOU CAME ALL THE WAY UP HERE BECAUSE YOUR HI JACKING OUR COMMUNITY BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING. MONEY OFF OF OUR COMMUNITY PROVIDING A BAD SERVICE AND ACTUALLY HAVE GETTING PEOPLE DEPORTED OR NOT ALLOWING THEM TO IT TO WRITE THEIR PAPERWORK BECAUSE IT'S DONE WRONG THE FIRST TIME. AND ALL OF US THERE IS NOT A SINGLE PERSON WHO I THINK TESTIFIED TODAY WHO IS NOT HEARD THOSE STORIES. SO UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE -- A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF WHO THE THE THE QUALIFIED. WELL ESTABLISHED. TESTED WORKING UNDER AN ATTORNEY IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT HAS I I HAVE NO ABILITY TO DO ANYTHING BUT SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND I I WANT TO THANK YOU I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH BILL TO BRING FORWARD I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET A LOT OF A LOT OF LETTERS IN MY COMMUNITY A LOT OF VISITS FROM FOLKS WHO. OPERATE SMALL BUSINESSES MY COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO SAY THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BAD ACTORS. ON PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS IS TOO GREAT TO ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE SO THANK YOU FOR THE RING AS BILL AND I MOVE. AND I'M THINKING IF YOU HAVE A I'M SORRY. WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU -- NO YOU CAN ONLY RESPOND IF YOU ASK THE QUESTION [inaudible] GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I'VE I SHARE THE CONCERN FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO AND I'VE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED LEGISLATION THAT YOU PASS A FEW YEARS AGO. TRYING TO REGULATE THE ABUSIVE PRACTICES OF NOTORIOUS. I ACTUALLY SUPPORTED A VERY SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR. IN IN REVIEWING THIS AGAIN AND LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY I DO THINK THAT THAT BILL -- IT AND THIS BILL IS IS OVER BROAD I MEAN I I THINK WHAT WE'VE HIT ON IS HEY WE DO NEED. YOU KNOW BETTER TRAINING WE DO NEED TO HAVE -- YOU BETTER PRACTICES BUT TO WHAT THIS BILL SEEMS TO DO IS JUST COMPLETELY GET RID OF THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT. THE INDUSTRY WILL ALL TOGETHER AND I AND I THINK AS WE'VE SAID HERE NOT NOT EVERYBODY IN THAT INDUSTRY IS A BAD ACTOR IN FACT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD ACTORS WHO ARE HELPING PEOPLE. EVERY DAY -- IN IN THIS SPACE AND SO I THINK THIS IS JUST IS JUST TOO DRASTIC OF A MOVE -- AND I'M ALSO REALLY HESITANT ANYTIME THAT WE YOU KNOW AND GOVERNMENT SORT OF I MEAN ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE AN ENTIRE -- INDUSTRY YOU KNOW WITH A PIECE OF LEGISLATION I THINK BEFORE YOU TRY TO DO IS. GO TO SOMETHING THAT DRASTIC MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT OTHER THINGS THAT COULD HELP. ENSURE THAT THERE ARE PROTECTIONS BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY IN HERE CARES ABOUT ENSURING THAT. PEOPLE DO GET GOOD ADVICE THAT THINGS ARE FALL THROUGH ON WITH REGARD TO THEIR IMPORTANT IMMIGRATION -- ISSUES AND DOCUMENT SO -- NO I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL IN THIS FORM -- AND YOU KNOW WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS MAY BE MORE FROM THE SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW MAYBE IT MAYBE THERE IS. SOME COMMON GROUND THAT WE COULD THAT COULD BE REACHED WITH THE OPPOSITION -- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S ON TRAINING OR FURTHER PROTECTIONS OR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CERTIFICATION. NOW I THINK THERE'S MAYBE SOMEWHERE WE CAN GET THERE SO. THAT I WOULD JUST ASK IF MAYBE YOU COULD WORK ON THAT YOU KNOW AS YOU AS YOU MOVE MOVE THE BILL. FOR THANK. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD JUST FROM. AND THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT ONE OF THE THINGS WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IS UNLESS PRACTICE OF LAW AND IN THESE IMMIGRATION CASES THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE TOP AREAS THAT THE BAR. HAD NECESSARILY GONE AFTER WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BAR DOES. MEET ITS PUBLIC PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS BY GOING AFTER A LICENSE PRACTICE OF LAW WITH THIS CONSTANTLY CROPS UP AS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES. SO IT'S STATE IT IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE I UNDERSTAND IT'S A VERY EMOTIONAL ISSUE. FOR THOSE CONSULTANTS WHO ARE. WORKING TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING IN VARIOUS AREAS THERE BUT A NUMBER OF TABS TO TRY AND ADDRESS THIS AND AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS A LOT OF PEOPLE GET HURT. A LOT OF OF EXAMPLES OF UNLESS HIS PRACTICE OF LAW WHICH DOES HARM THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S WHY VERY SERIOUSLY. SO THAT WAS MISS CAREER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SUPPORTERS I CAME TO TESTIFY AS WELL AS THE OPPOSITION WHO IS HERE TO TESTIFY YOU HAVE A MISTER GALLAGHER TO YOUR POINT. IS CONSOLIDATING HER -- ADVOCACY AS WELL YOU DO HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM MYSELF AND FOR MY OFFICE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COME TO A RESOLUTION. THE DOESN'T PUT PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND CHORES THAT ANYONE THAT'S SEEKING IMMIGRATION HELP IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH AT STAKE. HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE LEGAL SERVICES FROM ANY CERTIFIED LEGAL PROVIDER FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED OR AN ATTORNEY WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION CASES. THAT'S A FORMALLY UNDOCUMENTED PERSON MYSELF I TAKE OFFENSE TO THAT I WOULD PERSONALLY DO ANYTHING THAT'S EVEN SLIGHTLY ASSOCIATED. WITH THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES I WOULD NEVER PUT MY COMMUNITY AT HARM'S WAY. AND THIS IS IN FACT AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THAT VERY COMMUNITY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR NINE THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHAU CHIU. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE [inaudible] PETRIE-NORRIS. AS I REYES. THAT NEEDS TO MORE OF THE PLACE THAT THE LAW CALL. THANK YOU. THAT TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN AB SIXTEEN OH SEVEN MS BARNHART [inaudible] FIVE I GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. SO COULD WE PLEASE HAVE A QUITE SO WE CAN CONTINUE OUR HEARING PLEASE -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEARING THE SPELL SIXTEEN OH SEVEN IT WOULD REQUIRE CITIES AND COUNTIES THE ISSUE LOCAL BUSINESS LICENSES TO ISSUE A NOTE NOTICE TO A BUSINESS. WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE GENDER TAX REPEAL ACT AT THE TIME THE BUSINESS RECEIVES ITS BUSINESS LICENSE. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE GENDER TAX REPEAL ACT PROHIBITS BUSINESSES FROM CHARGING DIFFERENT PRICES FOR SERVICES BASED ON GENDER. VIOLATION OF THE FAULT RESULT IN AN AUTOMATIC FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR STATUTORY PENALTY OR THREE TIMES THE ACTUAL DAMAGES SUFFERED WHICHEVER IS HIGHER. THE ACT ALSO REQUIRES CERTAIN BUSINESSES TO POST A NOTICE AND TWENTY FOUR POINT FONT OF THE GENDER TAX REPEAL A VIOLATION OF THIS POSTING REQUIREMENT RESULT IN A THOUSAND DOLLAR STATUTORY PENALTY. THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT AWARE THAT THIS LAW EVEN EXISTS. SOME SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE CHARGE DIFFERENT PRICES FOR SERVICES BASED ON TIME AND EFFORT. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TARGETED WITH FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS DEMANDING THE MINIMUM STATUTORY PAMPHLET PENALTY AND MORE. PERSONALLY THIS IS THAT IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE MANY OF YOU KNOW I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS I DESIGNED SENSORY FAMILY CLOTHING FOR LITTLE GIRLS. AND THE REASON I CHOSE LITTLE GIRLS AND LITTLE BOYS IS BECAUSE IT'S MORE FUN TO DESIGN FOR LITTLE GIRLS -- BUT HAD I DONE THIS ALSO FOR BOYS I WOULD HAVE NOT KNOWN ABOUT THIS LAW AND I THINK I WOULD HAVE VIOLATED IT. AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE SMALL THINGS WE CAN DO TO REALLY MAKE SURE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE AWARE AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW. SO AB SIXTEEN OH SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE CITY OR COUNTY. WHO ISSUES ISSUES THE BUSINESS LICENSE TO NOTICE? GIVE NOTICE OF THE GENDER TAX REPEAL ACT OF THE TIME THE BUSINESS RECEIVES ITS BUSINESS LIFE. IN ADDITION AB SIXTEEN OH SEVEN WHAT AUTHORIZED THE CITY OR COUNTY TO INCREASE THE FEES FOR A BUSINESS LICENSE TO RECOVER THE ACTUAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUING THIS NOTICE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY IS JENNIFER BARRERA FROM THE CAL CHAMBER TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT AND PLEASE TO SPONSOR THIS BILL WE HAVE SEEN. INSTANCES IN WHICH SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN. BASICALLY SUBJECT TO FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS -- FOR PRICE DIFFERENTIALS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO JUSTIFY BUT THE COST OF THE FENCE IS JUST SIMPLY TOO HIGH FOR THEM TO ENGAGE IN -- AND THEY'VE BEEN LEVERAGED BY SOME UNSCRUPULOUS I WOULD SAY PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS -- FOR THE AUTOMATIC FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STATUTORY DAMAGES EVEN THOUGH THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICING IS NOT A NOMINAL LIKE TWENTY CENTS I THINK ON A DRY CLEANING AND IT WAS JUSTIFIED BY THE TIME AND EFFORT ENGAGED IN SO. WE'RE JUST HOPING TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESSES BY GIVING THEM NOTICE UP FRONT OF WHAT THIS LAW REQUIRES SO THAT ONE THEY CAN SATISFY THE POSTING REQUIREMENT AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY AND TWO IF THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE PRICE DIFFERENTIALS. THAT THAT PRICE DIFFERENTIAL IS OBJECTIVE AND THEY ARE INFORMED AND THE CONSUMERS INFORMED ON WHAT THE DIFFERENCES SO THAT THEY CAN AVOID A POTENTIALLY THESE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THAT THEY'VE BEEN SUBJECTED TO AND SO WE AGAIN -- PLEASE TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I THINK THAT IS THEIR OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I VOTE ON AB SIXTEEN OF SEVEN THANK YOU I DO NEED A MOTION. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I CHAU CHIU AND SALAS. CONSULT AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS. PETRIE-NORRIS I REYES. THAT NEEDS ONE MORE -- PLACE IT ON CALL THANK YOU. MR TANG. SPRING THIS TO ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN A. B.. THIRTEEN SIXTY MORNING -- MISTER MEMBERS -- AB THIRTEEN SIXTY ESTABLISHES JUST BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR GROCERY DELIVERY THROUGH ONLINE PLATFORMS. IT JUST GIVE EXAMPLE THE BILL REQUIRES DELIVERY PERSON OF A FOOD HANDLER CARD. THAT ASKED DELIVERY VEHICLE TO ME VEHICLE CODE STANDARDS. HOUSE THAT THE ONLINE PLATFORM DRIVER TO ENSURE FOOD IS TRANSPORTED MEETING SPECIFIED HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. THE AND AGAIN. WHEN WE GO TO THE GROCERY STORE THE FOOD IS HANDLED IN A PARTICULAR WAY WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE? THAT AS IT'S DELIVERED THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT SAME -- CONSUMER SAFETY AND THAT HEALTH SAME HEALTH STANDARDS. WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IDLE FOR A. B. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN HAVE WITNESSED. THANK YOU FIRST WHAT IS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS. MY NAME IS DANIEL CURRY AND I REPRESENT THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OVER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND UNION MEMBERS TO SUPPORT. THIRTEEN SIXTY THIS BILL CLOSES THE GAP IN LIABILITY COVERAGE THAT EXISTS FOR CONSUMERS TO USE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS AND FOR WORKERS OF THOSE DELIVERY PLATFORMS. AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN SURE IS THAT OF CONSUMER WORKER. SUFFERS HARM AS A RESULT THE FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM THAT VICTIM IS NOT LEFT BEAR THE COSTS. I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I'D SEEN THAT IS OUR OPPOSITION. MR CHAN MEMBERS COURT IN JENSEN WITH TECH MATT HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO AB -- THIRTEEN SIXTY WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO THE DELIVERY OF FOOD. FOOD SAFETY AND CONSUMER TRUST IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR TECHNICS MEMBER COMPANIES AND WE HAVE DONE MUCH TO WORK WITH OUR RETAIL AND GROCERY PARTNERS TO DELIVER FOOD. AND AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED RACE BASED FOOD SAFETY MEASURES APPROPRIATE FOR THE POTENTIAL FOOD SAFETY RISKS. BUT SIMPLY THIS BILL IS TRYING TO FIT THE THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY INDUSTRY INTO A BOX THEY DON'T FIT IN THIS WILL STIFLE THIS INNOVATION AND HARM CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. NOT TO MENTION THE ELIMINATION OF EARNING POTENTIAL OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO MAKE MONEY ON THESE PLATFORMS. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SINGLES OUT COMPANIES THAT SERVE CONSUMERS BY PROVIDING CONVENIENCE AND CHOICE TO HAVE FOOD STORE WHICH INCREASES THE MARKET RESEARCH OF THOSE MARKET REACH OF THOSE BUSINESSES. THERE'S TWO BASIC MODELS JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE IDEA OF THESE PLATFORMS -- FIRST FOR MANY GROCERY FOOD DELIVERY ORDERS A CUSTOMER SUBMITS IN ORDER TO THE GROCERY STORE AND A GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEE ASSEMBLES THE ORDER. AND THEN THE DRIVER WORKING ON THE DELIVERY PLATFORM PICKS UP THE ORDER AND DELIVERS THAT TO THE CUSTOMER. FOR OTHER ORDERS A SHOPPER GOES TO THE GROCERY STORE PICKS UP THE GROCERIES IN THE SAME WAY THE CONSUMER WOULD AND THEN THE SHOPPER ACTS LIKE THIS CONSUMER. THAT PAYS FOR THE GROCERIES AND TRANSPORTS THEM TO THE CONSUMERS HOME. SO FOR THE BILL IT BY ONE OF THE PROVISIONS THE BILL REQUIRES ADD THESE DRIVERS HAVE FOOD HANDLER CARDS NOT EVEN GROCERY STORE pSAME THING AS THE SHOPPERS WOULD DO. ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE FOOD HANDLER CARDS ONLY THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT PREPARE AND SERVE FOOD ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE FOOD HANDLER CARDS. DIFFERENT FOOD HANDLER CARD PROGRAM REQUIRES A NINETY MINUTE COURSE AND THEN PASSING A FORTY QUESTION TEST FOCUS ON HOW FOOD IS PREPARED AND SERVED NOTHOW FOOD IS GONNA PICKED UP FROM THE GROCERY STORE AND THEN DELIVERED TO A CONSUMER. SO THE INTENT OF THE FOOD HANDLER CARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR WORKERS AT RESTAURANTS AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE FOOD IS BEING PREPARED AND SERVE WHICH IS NOT THE CASE FOR THESE DRIVERS SIMPLY COLLECTING. AND DELIVERING PACKAGE PRODUCTS TO A CONSUMER. THEY DID SOME HURDLE OF THIS WOULD REQUIRE THAT DELIVERY DRIVERS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THIS FOOD HANDLER CARD WHICH WOULD BE A ROAD BLOCK FOR MANY OF THESE DRIVERS WHO JUST DO THIS -- TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA MONEY -- WHILE DOING OTHER JOBS OR RAISING AT CHILD OR BEING A STUDENT -- THERE'S MANY OTHER PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE FINAL ONE I'LL MENTION IS THAT. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA WOULD SUPPLANT CALIFORNIA'S LEADING REGULATORY GUIDANCE ON I'LL CALL DELIVERY -- UNDERSTANDING THIS NOT THE GEO COMMITTEE BUT AND FOR THAT I'LL CALL DELIVERY SECTION THE CALIFORNIA ABC IS OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN GUIDANCE ON THE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS -- CREATED INEFFECTIVE REGULATORY REGIME FOR THIRD PARTY DELIVERY DRIVER A DELIVERY OF OUT HALL AND THEN A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN AND USED AS A MODEL THERE'S NO REASON THAT THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO SUPPLANT THAT REGULATORY SCHEME. I'LL WRAP UP BY SAYING THAT ARE MET MEMBER COMPANIES PROVIDE TO THEIR SHOPPERS INFORMATION THEY NEED TO SAFELY PERFORM THE WORK THAT THEY DO WHICH IS SIMPLY GOING AND PICKING UP GROCERIES AND DELIVERING IT. AND WE DO NOT THINK THAT SIT BIDDING THIS INNOVATIVE INDUSTRY INTO A PRE EXISTING ON RELATED REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS IT APPROPRIATE AND I THINK YOU AND ASK FOR KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. BOB MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF GROUP. OF ALBERTSON'S SAFEWAY -- WE ARE HERE WAS A LITTLE LATE OPPOSITION AND WE'RE NOT A 100% SURE IT'S OPPOSITION MY CLIENT HAS REVIEWED THE BILL AND HAS IDENTIFIED SOME CONCERNS RELATIVE TO THE BUSINESS MODEL. THAT THEY USE FOR HOME DELIVERY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MR TANG THE SPONSORS AND HIS STAFF TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION BUT AS WRITTEN THEY DO HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS SO WE WANTED TO GET ON THE RECORD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING LOWER CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT SIGNALED VISITING YOU MAY CLOSE. AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITIONS -- FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS. AGAIN THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT I'VE USED -- TO PERSONALLY AS A CONSUMER AND I'M A BIG FAN OF HOWEVER WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE -- FOOD IN SAFETY -- HANDLING STANDARDS ESPECIALLY AS THIS INDUSTRY EXPANDS AND MORE MORE PEOPLE USE THEM WE SEE THIS INDUSTRY AS A CONTINUUM OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE GROCERY STORES AND AGAIN. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FIVE OH FOR A. B.. THIRTEEN SIXTY THANK YOU. LOOKING FOR A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CULTURAL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHAU. CHIU GONZALEZ CONSULT BY HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN. OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS I REYES. THE BILL NEEDS TO MORE -- PLACE IT ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER TECH. THAT BRINGS US TO MISTER REAVIS. ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN A. B.. SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT AS CHAIR OUR GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND COLLEAGUES OKAY WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. HOW DOES IT WELL I -- FIRST ONE TO SAY GOOD MORNING -- AND TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THE ANALYSIS SO I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE VERY LONG BUT THE ANALYSIS WAS GLOWING SO I APPRECIATE IT -- BUT NOT LAST YEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL HABIA BUT SERRA HIS THAT WAS THE BUREAU OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE -- ANY DID SO TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES. PEOPLE COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE THAT INDOOR A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARDS. SO AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATES TOO FREQUENTLY ARE STATES LOWER INCOME -- THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR EXPERIENCE FAR GREATER IMPACTS FROM POLLUTION FROM TOXICS. FROM THE TOXIC -- CONTAMINATION AND THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING THAN RICHER AREAS OF THE STATE. UNFORTUNATELY THESE THESE IMPACTED AREAS AND THE CAT THAT COMMUNITIES OFTEN LACK RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT WE COMBAT SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS. AND RARELY RARELY THEY POSSESS THE MEANS TO REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS THEIR CONCERNS IN COURT OR BEFORE THE APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY OR REGULATORS. THUS THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED A KEY ROLE OR A VOICE IN DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIVES. SO AS A RESULT THIS BILL AB SIXTY TWENTY EIGHT IT DOES TWO THINGS FIRST IT WOULD INCLUDE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED DOJ'S BUREAU ENVIRONMENTAL. JUSTICE -- TO TO THE LIST OF AGENCIES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH MUST COORDINATE WITH REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS. AND SECOND RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE -- THESE COMMUNITIES TO BE INVOLVED TO BE ENGAGED WITH STATE GOVERNMENT AND TO TRULY HAVE AGENCY IN THE DECISIONS THAT IMPACT THEM. AT THIS BILL EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO INCLUDE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT. TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE IS MEANING FULLY ENGAGING PEOPLE OF ALL RACES CULTURES AND INCOMES. WHEN MAKING THESE DECISIONS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS AND SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I DO HAVE THE BILL'S SPONSOR WITH US HERE TODAY FROM THE CALIFORNIA JUSTICE ALLIANCE AND ALLOW THEM TO TO DO SOME SELF? THANK YOU CHRIS WITNESS PLEASE A GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIFFANY AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUST ALLIANCE. A SALES A PROUD SPONSOR OF AB SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WHICH ADVANCE IN THE FORMAL JUSTICE ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST BY REQUIRING THE OFF TO PLAY RESEARCH TO CONSULTS WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL'S BUREAU VJ ON EASY PROGRAMS WE BELIEVE THAT THE STRESS AND COORDINATION WOULD HELP TO ENSURE THAT MORE EASY COMMITTEES. THAT PREDOMINATE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WOULD RECEIVE GREATER PROTECTIONS INCREASE RESOURCES AND MORE SUPPORT WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEED TO PROTECT THEIR HEALTH AND LIVELIHOODS. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE DIFFERENCE AT THE AGE OF YOUR HAS MADE IN SEASON COMMUTES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I LOOK FORWARD TO THEIR ENHANCE COORDINATION WITH OPR. SECOND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE BILL'S INCLUSION OF MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENTS AND THE STATE'S DEFINITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. I DID THIS CONCERT WITH A LINE CALIFORNIA DEFINITION MORE WITH THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF VJ. I WOULD IN ADVANCE PROCEDURAL JUSTICE NOT JUST DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE WHEN IT COMES -- TO INFORMAL JUSTICE. WHILE WE THE CURRENT DEFINITION DOES DISCUSS THE NEED TO EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS TO ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF RACE CLASS GENDER ECCENTRIC THEIR BACKGROUNDS. ATTY MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WOULD SET A CLEAR MESSAGE TO DECISION MAKERS FROM THE STATE LEVEL TO THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT FRONT LINE AFFECTED COMMITTEES A RESIDENTS DESERVE TO BE AT THE TABLE WHEN IMPORT DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE THAT AFFECT THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND OUTCOMES. AND WE ALSO WANT RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ALSO HAVE LOCAL EXPERTISE ON EACH ISSUES. LASTLY SO HOW WOULD LIKE TO APPRECIATE IT SO THE MEMBER REVERSE WAS LEADERSHIP ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK GOODNESS PLEASE. MEMBERS THAT MY NAME IS JASIM JOHNSON AND I'M WITH PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LOS ANGELES AND WE ARE -- A MEMBER OF SAY HI AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL -- AS GOING USING HEALTH BERMAN SOCIOPATHS ARE AWAY I EXAMINE THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT LAND USE AND PLANNING PLAY IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. AND REQUIRED FOR NATION BETWEEN -- OPR AS WELL AS ALL OTHER OVERSIGHT AGENCIES AND THE AG'S -- BIERMAN RAMIL JUSTICE WILL ONLY FURTHER STRENGTHEN POLICIES PUT IN PLACE TO UP LIFT AND I'M PROTECT OVER BRING COMMUNITIES. IN IN CALIFORNIA EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS FEAR WILL BE ABLE TO REMEDY INSTANCES ENVIRONMENT AND JUSTICE WHERE IT'S NOT BEING PROPERLY ADDRESS SUCH AS MANY INSTANCES OF INCOMPATIBLE AND USE AND SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST LA -- ADDITIONALLY SIXTEEN SB SIX AND TWENTY EIGHT BY FORMALLY ESTABLISHING AGES BUILT ON EACH DAY ENSURE THAT THERE'S A PERMANENT BODY IN PLACE TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND BEHALF OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. AND IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT PLACES WHERE THE LITTLE VERY LITTLE RESOURCES ON OR INTEREST FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OR EVEN REGULATORY FAILURE. ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE HAS STRONG ROOTS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT YET IS OFTEN CARPETED BY INDUSTRY AND OTHERS WHO CARE LITTLE FOR THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING A FRONT LINE COMMITTEES. LASTLY BUT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND CLICK WITH GREAT INSIGHT EXCITEMENT -- IS THE BILL'S EXPANSION OF THE DEFINITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS WELL AS UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY BY THE BURDEN OF POLLUTION AND OF OUR MELINDA COLLECT. YET THEY OFTEN -- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED HAVE LITTLE RESOURCES AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE -- WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES -- RESIDENTS OFTEN HAVE TO FIGHT TO SIMPLY HAVE AND PUT ABOUT A POTENTIALLY HAS THIS WAS SO HE'S MOVING TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND MOREOVER IT IS THE HISTORICAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION THAT IS PLACES COMMUNITIES IN THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY ENTERING. ESSENTIALLY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WITHOUT MANY BOOKING ENGAGEMENT IS SIMPLY NOT JUSTICE. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE SOMEONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REDUCES LEADER SHIP AND PRIORITIZING PRACTICALLY ADDRESSING A FAMILY JUSTICE AND ENSURING CLEAN SAFE AND HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS IN CALIFORNIA. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTES THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. FOR CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

SIGNALED THE SERVICE YOU MAY CLOSE -- MISTER CHAIR AGAIN -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE THIS MORNING AND CERTAINLY THIS BILL SUPPORT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MISSION TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE -- BUT COMMUNITIES -- AND AND AND AND WHEN YOU SHARE THEIR MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT IN EFFORTS TO COMBAT BY MIDDLE HAZARDS -- IT'S R. SPEC WE ASK FOR YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. CHAU CHIU GONZALEZ. SALAS I HOLDEN.

WELCOME THIS WILL TAKE US TO ITEM NUMBER THREE AB. THREE SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU THERE IS A MOTION AND A SECOND. SO AT WITH THE MOTION AND A SECOND I WOULD JUST SAY ADD THAT AT EIGHT A. B. THREE SEVENTY EIGHT WAS HEARD EARLIER I'M IN THE LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT AND IT PASSED A UNANIMOUSLY. FROM THE ASSEMBLY LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT AT COMMITTEE THIS IS ABOUT ALLOWING CHILD CARE WORKERS A SEAT AT THE TABLE THROUGH -- BARGAINING. AND I DO HAVE SOME FOLKS I HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I WILL LET THEM INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND IS THE ONE YOU. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS YES THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL RIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS LIZ THAT REINA. I LIVE IN LOS BANOS AND I HAVE BEEN A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. LICENSE LARGE FAMILY CHILD CARE AND CURRENTLY CARE FOR SIXTEEN CHILDREN. TEN WHICH ARE ON STATE SUBSIDIZED. I ALSO HAVE TWO CHILDREN OF MY OWN AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL THIS YEAR AND A CUTE SIX YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL. I'M ALSO A PROUD. MEMBER OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN D. U. D. W. AS FOR ME. LOCAL THREE THIRTY NINE THIRTY AN SD I YOU LOCALS NINETY NINE AND FIVE TWENTY ONE I'D LIKE THOUSANDS OF FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. DEDICATE MY LIFE TO NURTURING EDUCATING INFANTS TODDLERS AND SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IN MY HOME. I LOVE WHAT I DO AND TAKE MY WORK VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN MY HANDS IS THE EDUCATIONAL EMOTIONAL. SOCIAL WELL BEING OF THESE CHILDREN. AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY I AM I AM THEIR PARENTS PEACE OF MIND. WHEN THEY GO TO WORK? IN MY CARE THEY KNOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE BEING EDUCATED NURTURED AND KEPT SAFE. THE WAY I SEE IT THERE IS NO GREATER RESPONSIBILITY THAN TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE'S ELSE CHILD. AND YET FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS LIKE ME WE CAN BARELY TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN MUCH LESS FORD. A FORD. ANY ADDITIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO PROVIDE THE BEST EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION POSSIBLE. WE DON'T EARN A MINIMUM WAGE MUCH LESS COVERED BY MINIMUM WAGE LOSS IF WE GET INJURED ON THE JOB WE ARE ON OUR OWN AS WE ARE NOT COVERED BY WORKERS COMPENSATION LAWS. AND MANY OF US STILL STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE DESPITE THE SUBSIDIZED. IN FACT WE QUALIFY FOR THE SAME CHILD CARE SURVEYS THAT WE PROVIDE. JUST LET THAT SINK IN FOR A MOMENT WE QUALIFY FOR THE SAME STAES OF SURVEYS WE PROVIDE. THIS LOOK AT THINGS LIKE. SAVINGS SIX DAYS OF WORK VACATION TIME ARE JUST A PIPE DREAM I FACE CHALLENGES ON A DAILY BASIS. JUST RECENTLY AN ERROR IN A WORK PAPERWORK BY THE AGENCY I CONTRACT WITH MEANT THAT I WENT OVER A MONTH WITHOUT PAY. SALLY THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME. AND I DOUBT IT WILL BE THE LAST BECAUSE OF THE LOW WAGES I EARN WHEN I DON'T GET PAID ON TIME THAT MEANS THAT I CAN'T PAY MY MORTGAGE MY BILLS OR PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. FOR MY FAMILY AND I IT IT ALSO MEANS THAT I CANNOT CONTINUE TO AFFORD TO TAKE THE CHILDREN TO IN MY CARE ON EDUCATIONAL FIELD TRIPS. BY ART. ART SUPPLIES OR TOYS THAT WILL HELP THEM LEARN ALL OF THIS CONTRIBUTES TO OVER ALL EXCITING I FEEL. THAT MAYBE THAT NEXT TIME I WON'T BE ABLE TO STRETCH WHAT LITTLE FUNDS I HAVE AND WILL HAVE TO BE FORCED TO CLOSE MY DOORS. UNFORTUNATELY MEANT MY STORY IS ONE OF MANY AND A GLARING EXAMPLE OF THE DEEP CRACKS IN CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM. THAT NOT ONLY IMPACTS PROVIDERS LIKE ME BUT OUR CHILDREN AND PARENTS WHO RELY ON US. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS TO FORM A UNION AND AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE STATE WE KNOW THAT. IF WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE IN QUALITY AROUND AS WE NEED TO BE TREATED AS REAL PARTNERS. THE MOST MEANINGFUL WAY TO DO THAT IS BY GIVING AS THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN WITH THE STATE AS IT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR EPIC SEE FOR PROVIDERS LIKE ME. THEREFORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR HI BO FOR A. B.. THREE SEVEN EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT THIS BOOK.

MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION LOS WERE ALSO YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY SHOULD CALL FROM THE CHILD CARE LAWCENTER AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION HAVE A GOOD DAY. LEAGUE BYNUM YOU W. ASKED ME THEIR NINE THIRTY HOW CLOSE SPONSORS ON THE BILL AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. THE MORNING WHEN YOU PROUD CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WEIRD NEUTRAL ON THE BILL -- I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR WE EXPRESSED A CONCERN ABOUT THE PUBLIC RECORDS PROVISION IN THE BILL. AND WE APPRECIATE HER TAKING THE AMENDMENT TO ADDRESS THAT SOMETHING KILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION OR NEUTRAL OR OTHERWISE ALL RIGHT. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS GALLAGHER. YES SO I MY CONCERN AT THIS BILL IS THAT YOU KNOW I THINK ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW ALLOWING THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS GONNA MAKE CHILD CARE MORE EXPENSIVE AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE. REALLY DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY IN IN MY DISTRICT WHERE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE MIA. DON'T MAKE AS MUCH MONEY. AND YOU KNOW THE COST OF LIVING IN THE THINGS ARE GOING UP CONSTANTLY IN THE STATE IT MAKES IT VERY TOUGH YOU KNOW AND SO -- I BY NO A LOT OF PEOPLE TO PROVIDE CHILDCARE. BEYOND THE ONES OF MY DISTRICT THEY'RE REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN UNION UNIONIZE IN. AND YET THAT'S THE OTHER PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT YEAH FOR THOSE THAT WANT. TO YOU KNOW THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S HOW THIS YEAR PRAGUE IF -- BUT SHARING THEIR INFORMATION PRIVATE INFORMATION AND THEIR HOME ADDRESSES AND AND THEIR INFO ABOUT YOU KNOW THEIR CHILD CARE BUSINESS WITH THE UNION IS SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE DONE YOU KNOW AND SO. AND I AND I THINK IT GOES THE OTHER IS KIND OF A CONSTANT THEME HERE THIS YEAR WAS PRIVATE AND HE GOES TO OUR PRIVACY ISSUES LIKE. WHY SHOULD? THIS INFORMATION BE SHARED THIS PRIVATE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS WE SHARED WITH SOME THIRD PARTY GROUP -- THAT MAY HAVE AN INTENT THAT YOU JUST THAT YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY AGREE WITH -- SO I THINK WE SHOULD YOU KNOW HELP PROTECT THAT AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS THAT'S WHY. I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW YOUR INTENT BEHIND IT AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND AND CERTAINLY. YOUNG SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT BUT I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY AND WE NEED A LOT OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS OBVIOUSLY IT. IN THE STATE IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON A MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS -- AND SO THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL. CAN I JUST RESPOND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THE ELEMENTS THAT THAT COME UP -- IN TERMS OF THE COST BUT EIGHT EIGHT THINK THAT. THE REAL COST IS OUR FUTURE AND IF WE DON'T HAVE CHILD CARE WORKERS. THAT HAS A HUGE COST TO THE STATE TO THE EDUCATION AND PREPARATION OF OUR KIDS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM ACROSS ALL THE STATE. ABOUT A CHILD CARE WORKERS WHO ARE QUALIFY FOR THE SAME SUBSIDIES. THAT THE FAMILIES THAT THEY SERVE QUALIFY FOR US SO WE PAY FOR IT LET'S JUST BE VERY CLEAR -- A AND IT'S THROUGH ITS STATE SUBSIDIES SO I THINK THAT THAT'S BIGGER -- ISSUE AND I YOU KNOW I I THINK RESPECTFULLY ANYONEWHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE PART OF SOMETHING HAS THE ABILITY TO SAY NO -- BUT IT'S EIGHT THAT NEVER GOES AWAY -- INDEPENDENT OF SOMEONE MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION. THAT COULD HELP THEM. JUST A FOLLOW UP REALLY QUICK IS WHAT IF IT BECOMES A CLOTHES SHOP THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A SUCH THAN THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE CORRECT I MEAN IT WHEN YOU CAN RESPOND TO IT THAT'S FINE BUT I MEAN. ULTIMATELY AS YOU GAIN MORE BARGAINING POWER RIGHT. FOR EXAMPLESTATE WORKERS RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. RIGHT -- YOU YOU AND IF YOU GET. INTO THAT SITUATION RIGHT. THEN AND ALSO I AGAIN I I I I GO BACK TO THE ISSUE OF ARE WE GONNA GET MORE CHILD CARE WORKERS OUT OF UNIONIZATION. WE'RE GONNA GET MORE CHILD CARE WORKERS WHEN WE PAY THEM WELL WHAT'S YOUR EVIDENCE FOR THAT. IF THE EVIDENCE WITH ANY OTHER INDUSTRY WHEN PAY SUPPORTS THE WORK OF SOMEONE DOING THAT WORK WE GET BETTER WORKERS WE GET MORE WORKERS WE HAVE. CHILD CARE WORKERS. WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO BE IN THAT SPACE WHO WILL GO WORK FOR A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT BECAUSE THE FAST FOOD RESTAURANT PAYS MORE THAN WHAT THEY GET PAID? IT'S DRIVING IT'S SIMPLE IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS IT'S DRIVING PEOPLE OUT OF AN INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD. AN UP ALL THE SAID I THINK THAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE I HAVE HAD HAPPY INVITE ANY EVIDENCE HAVE RESEARCH YOU TELL ME WHO YOU LIKE IF I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT AND I HAVE HAD MY OWN. MY OWN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES WITH CHILD CARE WORKERS HE SAID THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT YEAH -- AND SO WE IS HIS WE CAN ALL TALK ABOUT OUR OWN SUBJECTIVE STORIES BUT YOU KNOW ABSENT SOME REAL EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S THE CASE I'M CONCERNED WITH SOMETHING THAT COULD ACTUALLY. LEAD TO LESS JOKER WORKERS. MISTER KALRA THE MS GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THE AUTHOR I'M A PROUD PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL I THINK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND I THINK THAT IF YOU TALK TO ANY WORKER. AND JUST KEEP THE WORD UNION ON UNIT OUT OF IT JUST LIKE YOU WOULD YOU LIKE BETTER PAY BENEFITS AND A VOICE. I THINK PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE WOULD SAY YES TO THAT. AND THE REALITY IS THAT THOSE ARE WORKING IN CHILD CARE -- OUR OFTENTIMES WORKING IN ISOLATION OFTENTIMES THEIR VICTIMS A WAGE THEFT OFTENTIMES OF VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THE BOYS THAT THEY DESERVE. CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANT JOB THAT THEY PROVIDE FOR ALL OF US AND SIMPLY JUST SAYING WELL. IF WE CAN IF IF FAMILIES PAVE THEIR CHILD CARE WORKERS THAT HAS MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKET IS REALLY AB I DISRESPECTED THOSE THEY'RE DOING THE WORK -- BECAUSE REALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING THE THE THOSE THAT. ARE IN THE THE THE HAD THE LEAST AMOUNT OF POWER. UP TO STAND UP TO ASK FOR A BETTER WAGES AND TREATMENT AND BENEFITS TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE BURDEN OF HAVING LOWER CHILDCARE COSTS. AS AS THE AUTHOR CORRECTLY SAID THE MONEY COMES FROM SOMEWHERE IT'S NOT LIKE -- BALLS WITH A FAMILY GOING TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS ON CHILD CARE AND THEN THAT THAT MONEY JUST RECKLESS APPEARS SOME SOMEWHERE. NO WE'RE EITHER PAYING IT BECAUSE ARE SUBSIDIZING OTHER. BENEFITS THAT THESE WORKERS ARE NOT. A DON'T HAVE THAT DON'T HAVE OR THEY'RE STRUGGLING AND SUFFERING -- IN POVERTY. AND SO IT'S AN EITHER OR AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL ALWAYS WE ALWAYS A BALANCING TEST ON ALL THESE ISSUES. BUT I THINK THERE'S AN OVERRIDING PUBLIC POLICY INTERESTS FOR US TO ENSURE THAT NOT JUST THE CURRENT WORK FORCE WHAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO BE A GROWING WORK FORCE A CHILD CARE WORKERS WHO ARE. IN MOST CASES THE VERY FIRST EDUCATOR THAT A CHILD HAS -- WE NEED TO TREAT THEM AS SUCH AND TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. AND I THINK THAT THIS HAS BEEN THIS INDUSTRY IS -- ONE THAT IS -- WILLIAM BECAUSE SEE PARALLELS TO MANY OTHER INDUSTRY THERE ARE DOMINATED BY A WOMAN A FEMALE WORK FORCE FOR THE MOST PART -- THAT GET PAID LESS THAN HALF LESS BENEFITS AGAIN BLOOD THAT'S RESPECT I THINK WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT AND THAT'S WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU -- BUT SOME OF THE MONTH [inaudible] GONZALEZ. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY -- FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM. HE IS NICHOLAS THANK YOU. CHICO -- THAT -- THERE IS NO. SUCH THING AS A CLOSED SHOP AND PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT -- THAT ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE A MEMBER OF A UNION. IS NOT FORCED TO BE A MEMBER OF UNION AND NOW THANKS TO A SUPREME COURT DECISION THEY ACTUALLY GET ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE UNION WITHOUT PAYING A SINGLE CENT. SO -- TO SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE SOMEBODY DOESN'T WANT TO BE PART OF A UNION -- I'D ASK OUR CONSTITUENTS IN A ANY CONSTITUENT -- WOULD YOU LIKE IN FACT THE BENEFITS OF OF HIGHER PAY -- WORKFORCE TRAINING BENEFITS -- AND BY THE WAY NOT HAVE TO PAY A SINGLE CENT BECAUSE WE ALLOW FREE RIDERS NOW AND I I WOULD ASSUME -- THAT THE ANSWER WOULD BE YES BECAUSE EVEN THOSE PLAINTIFFS IN THE JANICE DECISION DID NOT GIVE UP THEIR RIGHT TO PENSIONS AND HIGHER PAY THEY SIMPLY -- DID NOT WANT TO AT SPEND ANY MONEY TO ACHIEVE ADD THAT THE COLLECTIVE GOALS OF THE INDUSTRY SO. I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU NOT ONLY ON THE UNIONIZATION QUESTION BUT ALSO THE DATA THAT -- YOU ARE ATTRIBUTING TO THE AUTHOR AS AN OPINION THE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE CHILD CARE -- WILL LEAVE THE CHILD CARE PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE MORE TRAINING AND HIGHER PAY -- I THINK NOT ONLY IS THAT NOT COMMONSENSE THERE'S ACTUALLY THERE'S ACTUALLY STUDIES ABOUT WHY PEOPLE LEAVE HEALTHCARE SO IT WOULD IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION I WOULD THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK WE ARE MADE A MOTION BUT I'M I'M SAID BEFORE THERE. IS NO MORE IMPORTANT BILL I THINK THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON THIS -- ONE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE WORKERS WHO FOR FAR TOO LONG ARE UNDERPAID -- THAT WE RELY ON TO IT TO DO THE MOST BASIC -- FUNDAMENTAL. CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN. THE THINGS WE ALL AGREE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THEY HAVE UNFORTUNATELY JUST SLIP THE LOWER THE RATE ARE AND WAY TOO MANY THINGS THEY ARE WORKERS WHO CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED THEIR WORKERS THAT WILL NEVER BE AUTOMATED AND SO IT IS. ABOUT TIME THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON THIS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR IT AND I IT WILL VOTE YES TODAY. THE U. S. M. THE SOMEBODY WHAT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WERE HAVING A PRETTY PERSPECTIVE CONVERSATION I THINK ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE NOW ABOUT THE FUTURE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS ONE OF THOSE CRITICAL COMPONENTS AND SO FOR CHILD. CARE WORKERS WHO ARE. THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO START THAT EDUCATION. THE STEP WE NEED TO TAKE IS TO PROFESSIONALISM IS TO BRING THEM INTO THE WORK FORCE IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY HAVE THEM PAID WELL GIVE THEM BENEFITS. GIVE THEM RESPECT FOR THE THE POSITION THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR SOCIETY AND INTEGRATE THAT INTO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT'S ULTIMATELY THE GOAL THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS VERY APPROPRIATE. AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU AND I WANT TO ADD THAT YOU YOU KNOW IN THIS CONVERSATION. THAT UNIONIZING AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS A MEANS TO A GREATER GOOD WHEN I THINK OF WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO HAVE TRAINING FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT TAKE CARE. OF THE KIDS -- BELOW FIVE TO BE ABLE TO DENNIS ACT IN A FIGHT COGNITIVE CHALLENGES TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT REALLY IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST IN TERMS OF HEALTH DECISIONS EDUCATION DECISIONS -- THIS IS BIGGER THIS IS JUST A MEANS TO CREATE HEALTHIER. KIDS OF THAT OUR OUR FUTURE TOO REALLY PREPARE STUDENTS FOR A K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE -- ANYTHING SOMETIMES WE GET LOST THAT THIS IS ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD OF OUR FUTURE THIS IS GOING TO BE WHO LEADS THE STATE -- THIS IS THE MEANS TO ENSURE THAT THE WORKERS HAVE ALL THE TOOLS THAT THERE HE QUIPPED THAT WE PROFESSIONAL EYES. THE INDUSTRY IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE HAVE MORE INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO AND CAN STEP UP TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS NEEDED WORK. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHAU CHIU. AND SALAS. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS. NORTH AYE REYES. THE BILL IS ONE MORE OF A SAID ON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS WORKS THAT TAKES US. TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE ON OUR LIST AB SEVEN TWO FOUR WHERE HI. MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY -- YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF US KNOW THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER IT'S WILDFIRES -- THE COST OF LIVING FINANCIAL SECURITY -- WE HEAR AND SEE THE STORIES IN THE PRESS YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT ALONG WE'VE HAD ABOUT A 40% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS -- ANYTHING THOSE TRENDS ARE ARE GROWING AND AND CONTINUING -- WHAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE AS A STATEWIDE RENTAL REGISTRY DATABASE THAT WOULD HELP US COLLECT INFORMATION SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND TRENDS OF? EVICTIONS AND RENT INCREASES AND THINGS OF THIS NATURE -- I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN EVIDENCE BASED POLICY MAKING AND HAVING THE DATA TO CREATE THE POLICIES THAT WE NEED. TO TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS YOU KNOW PROTECT THE TENANTS THAT WE NEED. TO WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THIS READ THIS INFORMATION SOME CITIES HAVE. RENTAL REGISTRIES A MOST DON'T I'M SO THIS BILL IS VERY SIMPLE IT WOULD JUST SEEK TO CREATE A RENTAL REGISTRY SO WE CAN GATHER THAT INFORMATION AND FROM THAT INFORMATION THEN. FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE BEST POLICIES TO HAVE SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS SO. IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE BILL IN TERMS OF ITS CONCEPT -- WE PASSED OUT OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME IT'S TESTIFIED TODAY'S CATHERINE BRACE FROM TECH EQUITY AND THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS AS LISTED THE ANALYSIS YOU'RE TAKING THOSE IS OFFSHORE -- YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS HI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM CAPTAIN BRACEY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE -- WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE BAY AREA THAT BELIEVES THAT OUR STATE'S TECH DRIVEN ECONOMY CAN AND SHOULD CREATE BROAD BASED OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS. ARE CORE MEMBERSHIP CONSISTS OF RANK AND FILE TECH WORKERS WHO WANT TO USE THEIR UNIQUE POWERS RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA TO PUSH FOR POLICY CHANGES. THAT WILL ALLOW THE BENEFITS CREATED BY OUR BOOMING ECONOMY TO ACCRUE MORE PEOPLE SOLVING HOUSING CRISIS IS OBVIOUSLY A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF THAT EQUATION. AS TECH WORKERS WE ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE IMPACT WE ARE HAVING ON HOUSING COSTS IN CALIFORNIA WE FEEL THIS CRISIS TO AS MANY OF US PAY WELL MORE THAN A THIRD OF OUR INCOMES FOR HOUSING. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE PARTICULARLY FOR NEIGHBORS WHO ARE NURSES TEACHERS BUS DRIVERS JANITOR. AND OTHERS TO DO THE CRITICAL WORK OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO THRIVE IN FOR OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN MADE HOMELESS ORBIT OR BEEN DISPLACED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS TECH WORKERS WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING RELIABLE DATA TO INFORM DECISION MAKING. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AS WE HAVE BEGUN TO ENGAGE IN HOUSING ADVOCACY WORK WE HAVE FOUND THE POLICY CONVERSATION AROUND TEN A PROTECTIONS TO BE TAKING PLACE AND THE ABSENCE OF REAL DATA ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM. NO ONE REALLY KNOWS HOW MUCH RENTS ARE INCREASING ACROSS THE STATE. AT THE DATA THAT DOES EXIST FROM PLACES LIKE THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY AND PRIVATE COMPANIES LIKE ZILLOW ARE INSUFFICIENT IN MANY WAYS THEIR PROPRIETARY EXPENSIVE -- NOT COMPREHENSIVE AND THEY TEND TO REPORT TOP LINE DATA SUCH AS AVERAGES IN ORDER TO MAKE SMART HOUSING POLICY WE NEED GRANULAR TRANSPARENT AND COMPREHENSIVE DATA ABOUT RENTAL PRICES THAT CAN ONLY BE GATHERED BY ASKING THE LANDLORDS TO SUBMIT THEM DIRECTLY. WE'RE HAPPY TO STAND WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS ON THIS BILL AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOATS THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT UPDATE. HI DAVID ONLY HAVE THE BAY AREA HOUSING ADVOCACY COALITION IN SUPPORT. SUCH A HARD IN ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION HI THE ONLY BE WITH THE A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT SOCIAL FROM HERE IN OPPOSITION -- WE WE UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF WHAT THE A SOMEONE TRYING TO DO -- BUT WE STILL BELIEVE THERE'S NO RATIONAL REASON FOR MANAGING THIS EXTENSIVE INFORMATION. FOR A PUBLIC WEBSITE AND NO PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT THAT THIS INFORMATION WE USE IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS -- INVADE THE PRIVACY OF OWNERS AND TENANTS WHO LIVE IN RENTAL UNITS BY REQUIRING. DISCLOSURES OF THEIR DRESS UTILITY COSTS THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THEIR BEDROOMS. AND BATHROOMS AND ALSO MAKE TENS RIGHT PAYMENT HISTORY OR NON PAYMENT PUBLIC. IT ALSO REQUIRES MEMBERS DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PENSIONS. WHEN IT? WHEN THE INFORMATION BE MASKED? BY THE COURTS FOR PRIVACY REASONS -- THE PUBLIC INFORMATION WILL MAKE IT EASY FOR TENNIS THE NEIGHBORS. TO FIND PRIVATE INFORMATION SUCH AS RENT THAT THE REBBE NEIGHBORS ARE PAYING. WHY CERTAIN FAMILY MEMBER MOVED AWAY OR FAMILY? HOUSE WOULD MOVE THE WAY OR HOW SMALL THE APARTMENT IS. THAT LARGE FAMILIES LIMóN AND THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE POPULOUS PROVIDE EXACT SQUARE FOOTAGE OTHER UNITS UNDER STATE LAW NOW. BILLS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DEMAND ENTRY AND INTRIGUE AGAINST A TENNIS WISHES COLLECT THAT INFORMATION. AND THE LAST THING I'LL SAY. IS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT. DE ON PAGE SIX THAT THE A COMPANY A COMPANY TRADE OFFS IMPROV STILL WORTH THE BENEFIT. I GUESS WE ASK. WHAT? THE BENEFIT IS -- FOR IF IT'S FOR THE TENANT GROUPS IF YOU LOOK ON THE SUPPORT LIST THERE'S NO TENANT RIGHTS ADVOCATES -- LISTED IN SUPPORT AND ADDITIONALLY. WE BELIEVE THE INFORMATION CAN BE GATHERED NOW -- AND NOT NEED TO CREATE A STATEWIDE DATABASE COMPANIES LIKE COSTAR -- COLLECTORS TYPE INFORMATION NOW AND IT IS PRETTY -- IT'S EXTENSIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE. CAM THAT COMPANY ALSO HAS A BELIEVE THREE CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE -- ONE BEING THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES AND ADDITIONALLY TWENTY CONTRACTS ARE TWENTY PLUS CONTRACTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- DOING THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED SOME INFORMATION SO WE BELIEVE LOOKING AT BAM OR FOLKS LIKE THEM OUT IN THE UNIVERSE NOW. IS BETTER THAN QUEEN A BRAND NEW STATEWIDE DATABASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIM CAN MEREKA A WITH CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC ADVISERS ON BEHALF OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION OF PACIFIC SOUTHWEST. WE CAME IN WITH A LATE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND I JUST WANT TO ACTUALLY THINK THE AUTHOR AND THEIR STAFF BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US. MEMBERS ARE OUR GROUP SPECIFICALLY OUR CLIENTS REPRESENT A 100% DEED RESTRICTED PROPERTIES THAT ARE ALREADY COMPREHENSIVELY MONITORED REPORTED AND TRACKED. NOT ONLY THROUGH FEDERAL AND STATE AGREEMENT SPECIFIC PACIFIC WE THROUGH THE STATE OF TREASURY'S OFFICE. THE TREASURY'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW HAS ALL OF THIS INFORMATION SO FOR US WEIRD BASICALLY ASKING THAT YOU KNOW THIS ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT WHEN IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE IS UNNECESSARILY BURDENSOME FOR OUR MEMBERS. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT BE A WAY IF NOT EXEMPTING OUR MEMBERS MAYBE POSSIBLY PULLING THAT DATA FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. BECAUSE WE ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING GROUP OBVIOUSLY OUR MEMBERS ARE NONPROFIT AND SO THEY LIVE WITH MARGINS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT. A NECESSARILY BIRD DANCING THEM WE THINK THAT THE DIRECTION THE BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE LIKE I SAID WE SUPPORT REPORTING. IT'S JUST DO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T. DUPLICATE -- BE DUPLICATIVE FOR AND REDUNDANT FOR OUR MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I'D SAY NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. GALLAGHER. SO I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR BILL AND I MEAN FOR ME OBVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW. THEM THE BIGGEST THING IS HAPPENING MY DISTRICT IS IS A WILDFIRE AND ESPECIALLY IN THESE. YOU KNOW CRISIS SITUATIONS DISASTROUS SITUATIONS. THE REAL CONCERN IS THAT THERE IS LIKE RENTS BIKING AND THERE'S EVICTIONS GOING ON THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAPPEN AND THAT RENTS ARE BEING YOU KNOW -- BASICALLY ARBITRARILY AND INFLATED -- FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. LOOKING FOR DESPERATELY FOR HOUSING -- AND SO IN THAT CONTEXT IN AND I THINK ULTIMATELY IN THE IN THE HOUSE FOR IN SOLVING OUR HOUSING CRISIS ARE OUR ULTIMATE. SOLUTION IS INCREASING SUPPLY LIKE WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE HOUSING -- IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT WHETHER BECAUSE OF BURDENSOME REGULATIONS OR BECAUSE THE NAME BE ISM AND LOCAL [inaudible] RESTRICTIONS -- FOR WHATEVER REASON WE HAVEN'T BUILT A LOT OF HOUSING AND THAT ONLY MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS LIMITED. NO UNIVERSE OF HOUSING. THERE'S ONLY STE ONLY SO MUCH IN IT IN THAT THAT INCREASES I THINK ULTIMATELY THE COST. THE OF RENTS OF PURCHASES OF HOME SO -- BUT I GUESS MY ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT MY CONCERN WOULD BE OKAY BILL YOU KNOW HOW IS THIS. INFORMATION GOING TO BE UTILIZED RIGHT BECAUSE I AND I AGREE WITH YOU WE SHOULD. I ALSO WANT TO SEE EVIDENCE SO WANT TO SEE DATA RIGHT -- BUT WE CAN OFF OFTEN INTERPRET THAT DATA DIFFERENTLY -- AND I THINK IN THE IN THE GENERAL'S SCOPE OF THINGS. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY SHOULD RENT THEIR HOMES. FOR THE I DON'T BELIEVE IN RENT CONTROL -- I DO BELIEVE IN PROTECTING AGAINST ABUSES LIKE LIKE THAT WE HAVE SEEN. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IN THESE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO I MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT AND AND AND I GUESS LAST PROBABLY THE PRIVACY. ISSUES THAT I I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OPPOSITION ON SO MAYBE YOU CAN JUST KIND OF ADDRESS THAT. THAT WAS A LOT OF TICKET BUT NO HOUSING IS A BIG ISSUE IN A FEW A ONE IT BUILD MORE HOMES I GOT ANOTHER BILL FOR YOU SO. I GOT. ONE BUT I AGREE WITH YOU KNOW THE ISSUES AROUND WILD FIRES IN THE SPIKES AND RENT YOU KNOW THIS BILL DOESN'T SEEK -- TO PUT ANY KIND OF RENTER PROTECTIONS ON THOSE THERE'S OTHER BILLS I THINK AIMING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IN PARTICULAR WHICH I'M ALSO SUPPORT OF OF AND I DO BELIEVE WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. SO I THINK ALL OF THE ABOVE IS IS CRITICAL AND I THINK WE BOTH NEED. TO BOTH PROTECT RENTERS AND BUILD HOUSING IN DOING BOTH OF THOSE THINGS OFTEN I THINK IN THIS DEBATE. THOSE TWO SIDES GET PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO BOTH RIGHT -- IN TERMS OF THE THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS -- OUR GOAL HERE IS NOT TO EXPOSE ANYONE'S IDENTITY OR YOU KNOW ANYTHING THAT NATURE WE ARE GOING TO ADOPT AND ARE AT HAVE ADOPTED. BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING PRIVACY NAMES OF TENANTS WILL NOT BE PUBLIC -- NAMES OF LANDLORDS WILL NOT BE PUBLIC IT'S JUST THE INFORMATION ON WHAT ARE THESE UNITS BEING RENTED -- FOR YOU KNOW ARE ARE THERE -- YOU KNOW EVICTIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN I'M WHAT IS THE DAD IT WOULD THAT WE CAN COLLECT SO THAT YOU KNOW ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE TURNER CENTER UC BERKELEY THE FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN. TAKE THIS DATA AND UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE THAT -- YOU KNOW HOW THEY CAN -- ACCESS THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST ISN'T THAT DAD AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL TO DO IT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AS YOU KNOW I'M A BIG ADVOCATE ON PRIVACY -- AND AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE GUARD AGAINST ANY KIND OF COMPROMISE COMPROMISING SITUATIONS ON THE PRIVACY ISSUE -- WELL IF I COULD ALSO JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED HERE AS WELL -- YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE TENANTS GROUPS THAT ARE ADVOCATING FOR THIS -- IN TERMS OF OUR LIST OF SUPPORTERS HAVING TECH EQUITY IS ONE IN PARTICULAR THE WESTERN CENTER YOU KNOW AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION ALL OF OUR SPONSORS AND AND FOLKS ARE ADVOCATING ON THIS ARE VERY THOUGHTFUL ADVOCATES IN THE TENETS SPACE SO. I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW A KINDLY DISAGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT AND WITH REGARD TO YOUR SHOES YOU KNOW WE JUST GOT THIS OPPOSITION LETTER VERY LATE WE'RE HAPPY TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT. AND WE WANT TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY AND WE ALSO YOU KNOW WE TOOK THE REALTORS AMENDMENTS THEY RAISE SOME AMENDMENTS WE TOOK THOSE IN THE LAST COMMITTEE TO TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD SO. WE WANT TO WORK WITH FOLKS HERE IN TERMS OF GETTING THIS BILL THROUGH AND WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN THE PRIVACY STUFF AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION ON THAT. AND I DO HEAR YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE PRIVACY PIECE SO I'M COMMITTED TO TWENTY TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST THAT ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW IF I ANSWERED ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER OKAY. OTHER QUESTIONS ARE COVERED. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE. SIX YOU MAY CLOSE WELL I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I'M LOOKING FOR A A MOTION MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS.

TO LIMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE VICTIM SERVICES LOCATIONS MENTIONED IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN MODEL POLICIES ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND THEIR STAFF FOR WORKING THOROUGHLY WITH OUR OFFICE ON THIS BILL -- EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS A STATE OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INCLUDING SCHOOL POLICE AND SECURITY DEPARTMENTS FROM USING MONEY OR PERSON PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE INTERROGATE DETAIN DETECT OR ARREST PERSONS. FOR IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES. SB FIFTY FOUR REQUIRED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ESTABLISH MODEL POLICIES LIMITING ASSISTANCE WITH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. WE HAVE HAD ORGANIZATIONS WE REACH OUT TO US AND INFORM US THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS SEEKING SERVICES FOR DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE SINCE. TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE I WAS UNDOCUMENTED ARE WITHIN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND I HAVE AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I KNOW FIRST HAND THE FEARS THE STRESS THE CONFUSION OF TRYING TO SURVIVE MOMENT BY MOMENT KNOWING YOU CAN BE TORN FROM YOUR FAMILY AND DEPORTED AT ANY TIME. THIS FEAR IS REAL AND IT'S SOMETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET. I KNOW THE PAIN OF MY FATHER BEING ASKED FOR HIS DOCUMENTS AND BEING UNABLE TO PROVIDE THEM. I KNOW THE VISION MY PARENTS HAD FOR US A VISION THAT IS FOR FAILED AS BOTH ME AND MY SISTER. ARE NOW SERVING IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE PAIN OF MY FAMILY MEMBER -- WHILE SHE WAS GOING THROUGH -- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ASK FOR HELP WITH PROPER DOCUMENTATION. MOST UNDOCUMENTED SURVIVORS ARE TOO AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP. BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF BEING RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES. LET ME BE CLEAR ICE CANNOT BE PERMANENTLY STOPPED FROM ENTERING THESE LOCATIONS HOWEVER. AB TEN SEVENTY THREE WILL HELP REMEDY THESE FEARS BY WORKING WITH THE ICE ON HELPING PROTECT THE SURVIVORS IN THESE LOCATIONS. THANK YOU AND I DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES I JUST.

FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN AN ACT RELATING TO THE ADVERTISING OF AND LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR HELPING US WITH THAT AUTHOR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS AND HELPING US STRENGTH AND THE BILL. AS YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STARTED ISSUING STATE LICENSES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE OF LAST YEAR FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO OPERATE IN THE STATE. DESPITE SOME SUCCESS DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LEGAL SALES THE BLACK MARKET HAS CONTINUED TO FLOURISH DRIVING DOWN LEGAL SALES. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT BY THE CANNABIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT IS CREATING A THRIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE UNREGULATED UNDERGROUND MARKET. IN ADDITION TO DWINDLING TAX REVENUES THE UNDERGROUND MARKET PRESENT SERIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION THE CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOLD AT THESE LOCATIONS DOES NOT MEET ESTABLISHED QUALITY STANDARDS AND EVADES STATE TESTING. COME COMBATING THE UNDERGROUND MARKET IS A KEY POLICY GOAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. THIS BILL WOULD TARGET THE BLACK MARKET BY CRACKING DOWN ON A SPECIFIC PROBLEM THE ADVERTISING OF ILLEGAL OPERATIONS FOR PROFIT. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN WILL CREATE CIVIL PROBLEM NO PENALTIES FOR ENTITIES WOULD DECIDE TO ADVERTISE THE LEGAL OPERATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR PROFIT. AS THE LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT SAY THAT WE ARE TAKING THE CANNABIS BLACK MARKET SERIOUSLY IF WE ALLOW THE UNREGULATED. PROMOTION AND ADVERTISEMENT OF ILLEGAL BUSINESSES TO EXIST WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. WE KNOW THAT THESE ADVERTISEMENTS DRIVE BUSINESS TOWARDS ILLEGAL OPERATORS AND MUST FIND A WAY TO RESTRICT THIS PRACTICE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY AND I WILL NOW TURN THE MIKE OVER TO OUR SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS THANK YOU WE DO HAVE THE MOST IN A SECOND AND YOU MENTIONED THE MEMBERS WHO ARE TAKING THOSE IS OFTEN YES. JUST TO BE CLEAR THANK YOU MARIN -- CALIFORNIA ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE THAT KIND OF HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION HERE -- WHAT JERRY KILEY -- THANK YOU VERY TIME AND CHAIR KYLE ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED CAMAS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION -- AB FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN IS NOT A BILL TO RESTRICT ADVERTISING AND TECHNOLOGY OF LEGAL BUSINESSES THIS BILL THAN EFFORT TO HOLD A SMALL NUMBER OF TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR DELIBERATE IGNORANCE THE CLIENT THEY FACILITATE PROFIT FACILITATE FAIL FOR AND PROFITS OFF THOUGH THE LEGAL FAILED CAMPUS LAWS OR STATE REGULATED SO ADVERTISING SHOULD BE AS WELL. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THERE ARE OVER TWO THOUSAND ADVERTISED RETAIL LOCATIONS ON TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE OF THOSE LOCATIONS ARE LEGAL OVERWHELMINGLY THE CONSUMERS ARE CONFUSED WITH DECEPTIVE ADVERTISEMENT THAT ARE DESIGNED TO STRIP AWAY. THE MARKERS THAT DIFFERENTIATE A LEGAL AND ILLEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESS IT IS TIME FOR THIS DELIBERATE IGNORANCE OF WHO YOUR ADVERTISING FOR IS THE REASON WHY WE ARE HAVING THIS BILL. THESE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS HAVE MANY INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS EDUCATING THE CONSUMER ON SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CANNABIS FROM BROAD DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT CANNABIS IS IN THE HISTORY. OF IT AND THE NEW WANTS NATURE OF CANADA NOISE THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL FAX NO WHERE IN THIS VAST LIBRARY OF EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS IS ONE ON HOW TO FIND A LEGAL BUSINESS OR LEGAL DISPENSARY OR WHAT PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THERE ARE. IF YOU SHOP IN ANY LEGAL FACILITY. THESE CANNABIS CENTRIC PLATFORMS HAVE DUG DEEP AND PROVIDE EDUCATION ON EMERGING INDUSTRY AND LEFT OUT HOW TO SUPPORT ITS LEGAL GROWTH WE'D MAPS IS THIS VIOLATOR THAT WOULD RATHER SUPPORT THE ILLICIT MARKET. THAN TO PROFIT OFF THE ILLEGAL SALE OF THAT SUPPORT THE TAX PAYING ENTITIES TO KEEP THE GROWTH THIS INDUSTRY SAFE CONTROLLED AND REGULATED. THE GOOD PART OF THE STORY IS THAT THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS THE CAMPUS ADVERTISING WORLD. BUT I FOUND THE MORAL COMPASS AND EVER AND HAVE REMOVED AND RESTRICTED ADVERTISING. TO JUST LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES ONLY LEAVE FULLY THE MOST VISITED CANNABIS WEBSITE IN THE WORLD -- HAS REMOVED ALL I'M LICENSE CAN WITH BUSINESSES IN MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND CONTINUES TO RESTRICT ANY ADVERTISEMENTS FROM ILLEGAL BUSINESS AT LEAST FULLY MADE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO FOLLOW STATE LAW. IN THAT WE ALLOW PLATFORMS LIKE WE'D MATH TO CONTINUE TO PROFIT AND BOLDLY LEGAL OPERATIONS SO WITH LOOKING. THE OTHER WAY WHILE ILLEGAL BUSINESS TO SATURATE THE MARKET MORE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE FOLLOWING THE PROFITABLE BUSINESS MODEL OF SUPPORTING ILLEGAL BUSINESSES. AND THE SLIPPERY SLOPE OF MAKING ENFORCEMENT AND TAX COLLECTION NEAR IMPOSSIBLE OR JUST TO INSPECT IT TO JUST TOO EXPENSIVE FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. THIS BILL OF AN EFFORT TO DECENTRALIZE THE ENFORCEMENT OF WHAT IS AN EXPENSIVE AND DAUNTING TASK FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HOLD ENABLERS OF THE LEGAL BUSINESSES. ACCOUNTABLE THEIR BILLBOARDS MAGAZINES INTERNET ADS FLYERS MOBILE APPS AND OTHER PLATFORMS TO MONITOR AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF DOING THIS IS TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND INCENTIVIZE THEIR MONITORING -- FOR INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT WE'VE RESTRICTED THIS KIND OF ADVERTISING OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY BEFORE AND THE OWNERS A BACK PAGE DOT COM HAVE SERVE JAIL TIME FOR THEIR AIDING AND ABETTING OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. SO THIS IS NOT A PRECEDENT SETTING BILL. LAS VEGAS THAT WE'D MAP THE SYSTEM THE FIFTH AND THE FIFTH LETTER -- FROM THE TURNING DEPARTMENT TO WRAP UP PLEASE THE PROBLEM -- AND THEY'VE BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE MANY OTHER STATES OF HELD TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ACCOUNTABLE AND THEY HAVE ALL COMPLIED I WOULD LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE WHOLE THESE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ACCOUNTABLE AND GUIDE THE MARKET.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMEMBERS AB FOUR OH THREE INCREASES THE STATURE LIMITATIONS FOR FILING A WORKER RETALIATION CLAIM FROM SIX MONTHS. TO THREE YEARS AND HAS THE ABILITY TO SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES FOR FAILING. EMPLOYEES WORKPLACE RETALIATION OCCURS AND EMPLOYERS JUST CHARGE THREATEN WITH DOES CHARGE DEMOTE SUSPEND OR SUBJECT EMPLOYEES TO AN ADVERSE ACTION FOR EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LABOR CODE. POINTS RETALIATION CAN RANGE FROM SUBTLE WORKPLACE INTIMIDATION TO OUTRIGHT THREATS SUCH AS THREATENING DEPORTATION. IT IS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RETALIATION COMPLAINT REPORT THE LABOR COMMISSION REPORT ACCEPTING OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CASES PER INVESTIGATION RESULTING IN OVER. FIFTY TWO HUNDRED VIOLATIONS ALLEGED. ACCEPTED COMPLAINTS MAY ALLEGE MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS. ROUGHLY HALF OF THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS LABOR COULD LET NO TWO POINT FIVE WHICH PROTECTS WHISTLE BLOWERS SPECIFICALLY FROM ITALIAN XIN. TELL USES ONLY PERVASIVE BUT ALSO A GROWING PROBLEM TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE SURROUNDING IMMIGRATION. IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE OFTEN AFRAID TO COME FORWARD WORKPLACE RETALIATION CLAIMS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS HOWEVER WHEN THEY DO ESPECIALLY GIVEN. OR DO OR DO TO LACK OF AWARENESS THE SHORT STATURE LIMITATIONS THE CLAIM IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO BE FILED. EVEN IF WILL PLAY HAS A STRONG CLAIM OFTENTIMES THE BURDEN OF PAYING ATTORNEYS FEES CAN BE A DETERRENT. A DETERRENT FOR TO GRIEVE WORKER ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LOW WAGE. TWO YEARS AGO LEGISLATORS AND LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB NINETY SIX INTO LAW WHICH PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS. ENFORCEMENT THE RIGHT TO RESUME ATTORNEY'S FEES FROM THE EMPLOYER IF THE LABOR COMMISSION PREVAILS. THIS BILL SIMPLY BUILDS UPON SB NINETY SIX PROVIDING THAT SAME RIGHT TO PRIVATE CHARITIES. TAKE THESE RETALIATION CASES OFTEN ON PRO BONO STATUS ON BEHALF OF WORKERS. AND IT ONLY ENTITLES THE FEES IF THE WORK PREVAILS IS REALLY A KEY COMPONENT. THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT IS INTENDED TO INCREASE FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION AS THE OPPOSITION ARGUES RATHER PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SENSIBLE AND REGIONAL WASTE WORKERS PURSUE RECOURSE WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY RETALIATE AGAINST FOR INVOKING THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS UNDER STATE LAW. EIGHTY FOUR OH THREE STRENGTHENS LEGAL RIGHTS WHISTLE BLOWERS FACE TIE ASIAN AND ESPECIALLY HELPS LOWER WAGE WORKERS ATTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS WITH SOBRE TOLD FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY WAKES UP COALITION AND CAITLIN VEGAS THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU FIRST WITH THIS PLEASE. MY NAME IS RUTH SILVER TELL BY SUPERVISE THE WORKERS RIGHTS CLINIC AT ALEXANDER COMMUNITY LAW CENTER AT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. AND COORDINATE THE WAIT STAFF COALITION. OF SORRY OR BRING BACK BUT TO YOU. THANK GOOD MORNING -- THE EXISTING LAW PROVIDES WORKERS WITH ONLY SIX MONTHS TO FILE A CLAIM AT THE LABOR COMMISSION FOR WORKERS WHO ARE RETALIATED AGAINST BECAUSE THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT A VIOLATION OF THE LABOR CODE OR FOR WHISTLE BLOWERS. I HAVE SUPERVISED THE CLINIC FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND HAVE SEEN THE FULL RANGE OF RETALIATION AND WHICH WAS A BLOWER CASES FROM TERMINATION TO ACTUAL THREATS TO KILL. TO WORKER WHO WAS BEATEN UP WHEN HE ASKED FOR HIS WAGES SINCE THIS SINCE THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP THERE HAS BEEN AN UP TICK AND THREATS OF RETALIATION. FROM SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN NINETY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AND I RECENTLY TALKED TO A DEPUTY LABOR COMMISSIONER IN THE RETALIATION UNIT UNIT. WHO TOLD ME IT IS EVEN HIGHER NOW I HAD SEVERAL CASES WHERE THE EMPLOYER LEFT MESSAGES ON VOICE MAIL WITH THREATS OF DEPORTATION WHERE THE EMPLOYER THREATEN THE WORKER OVER THE PHONE? AND SHE WAS ABLE TO LEGALLY RECORDED BECAUSE HER BOYFRIEND WAS ALSO ON THE PHONE AND SPOKE WHERE THE EMPLOYER IS GOING TO THE WORKPLACE OF THE WORKER AND HER COUSIN AND THREATEN THEM NOT ONLY WITH DEPORTATION. BUT ALSO WITH THE VIXEN FROM THEIR APARTMENT AND A RECENT CASE WHERE THE EMPLOYER WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW WHERE THE WORKER LIVED REPORTED HIM TOP ICE. AFTER REFILED THE WAGE CLAIM AND ICE PICKED HIM UP AND HE'S NOW IN MEXICO A SIX MONTH STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IS TOO SHORT TO IN ONE CASE WE HAD. A SECURITY GUARD MADE A HEALTH AND SAFETY COMPLAINTS AND WAS FIRED SHE CAME TO OUR CLINIC AFTER SEVEN MONTHS BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WAS THREE YEARS AS IT IS IN WAGE CLAIMS. OTHER WORKERS WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT UNPAID WAGES AND WERE FIRED CAME TO OUR CLINIC TOO LATE IN MANY CASES A WORK -- IS THREATENED WITH DEPORTATION BUT NOT FIRED AND IS AFRAID TO FILE WATCH YOUR SHE IS STILL WORKING FOR THE EMPLOYER HOWEVER ONCE HERE SHE LEAVES THE WORKPLACE AND GETS ANOTHER JOB. THEY ARE WILLING TO FILE THE RETALIATION CLAIM IF THEY FILE THE WAGE CLAIM THEY WOULD HAVE THREE YEARS HOWEVER. IF SIX MONTHS OF A LAPSE SINCE THE THREAT THEY CANNOT FILE LOW WAGE WORKERS ALSO LACK ACCESS TO ATTORNEYS FEES AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TIME TO FIND AND GATHER EVIDENCE AND GATHER IT. THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR RETALIATION AT ABOUT AT OTHER AGENCIES AS LONGER AT THAT LSAT THAT'S THE THE LAW THAT SAID FORCE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS TWO YEARS THREE YEARS OF ITS WELL. FOR ONE YEAR AT THE DFG H. I HAD WORKED AT THE EEOC AND IT'S THREE HUNDRED DAYS IF YOU BRING THIS ELEVEN OH TWO POINT FIVE IN COURT YOU HAVE TWO YEARS. BUT IF YOU BRING IT AT THE LABOR COMMISSION YOU ONLY HAVE SIX MONTHS AND IF THE WAGE LOSS IS LOW THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS WILL BE BROUGHT IN COURT THERE'S ALSO WHEN ATTORNEYS THE PROVISION. AND THERE'S MANY PROVISIONS FOR ATTORNEYS FEES AND OTHER STATUTES FLSA WHISTLEBLOWER ACT AND ALSO FOR AT THE EEOC AND THE HOW THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. ARE I MEAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THAT ENFORCES FIAT THE OPPOSITION IS CLAIMING THAT IT WILL ENCOURAGE FRAIL FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION BUT ATTORNEYS LOSE EVERYTHING IF THEY BRING A FRIVOLOUSLAWSUIT. IN FACT THE BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE VALID CASES NOW ATTORNEYS WON'T TAKE CASES BECAUSE THERE'S NO FEES ATTORNEYS A BRING CLAIMS FOR DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT OR WAGE THEFT ARE ABLE TO RECOVER ATTORNEY'S FEES. ELEVEN OH TWO POINT FIVE IS AT ODDS WITH THOSE. THERE'S A STRONG PUBLIC POLICY TO PROTECT WORKERS AT RISK FOR THEIR JOB OR FOR OPPOSING ABUSES. THE BILL IS IMPORTANT TO LOW WAGE PREDOMINANTLY IMMIGRANT WORKERS THAT I REPRESENT AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO KAREN STRONG SUPPORT. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT -- FOR EMPLOYERS RETALIATION AS A WEAPON USED TO SILENCE WORKERS IT'S IT'S AT A PUNISHMENT BECAUSE WORKERS SPOKE OUT AND REPORTED ISSUES LIKE WAGE THAT LIKE UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. SO THE WORKER HAS ALREADY HAD THEIR RIGHTS VIOLATED SPOKEN OUT ABOUT IT AM BEEN PUNISHED OF COURSE THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO THEN COME FORWARD TO COMPLAIN ABOUT RETALIATION BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY SEEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THEY SPEAK OUT ABOUT WORKPLACE CONDITIONS. THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AND THAT THE RETALIATION STATUTE BE LENGTHENED INSTEAD IT'S MUCH SHORTER THAN THE UNDERLYING VIOLATIONS SO IT IT IT I THINK IS THE REVERSE OF WHAT. AND NEEDS TO BE THE CASE. I WOULD OUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC POLICY THERE BEEN A LOT OF REPORTS RECENTLY AROUND -- THE BOEING WORK FORCE WHEN THEY WENT NON UNION AND AND THERE WERE ALL THESE SAFETY VIOLATIONS THAT WORKERS WANTED TO REPORT THEY TOO WERE PUNISHED FOR SPEAKING OUT. ABOUT THE SAFETY VIOLATIONS SO IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER IT'S ABOUT THE WORKPLACE CULTURE AND THE CULTURE OF FEAR THAT GETS CREATED WHEN RETALIATION IS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY. IT'S ALSO ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND WORKERS BEING ABLE TO REPORT -- VIOLATIONS OF THEIR OWN RIGHTS AND ALSO ISSUES THAT ARE THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND FOR THEM TO BE PROTECTED SO WE'RE HEARD STRUCK SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT THIS THAT ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SHE HARD ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. JESSICA CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. THE LARA STRAND FLORES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. RENEE BORRADOR IS HERE YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. CORAL HENDON I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE WORKERS LIKE ME SHOULD HAVE MORE TIME TO FILE THE RETALIATION EARLY NINETY WILL TAKE MORE TESTIMONY WHICH IS TAKING NAME AND AFFILIATION. I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. CHRIS RESPONSE WHICH ALLOWED STRONG SUPPORT WE JUST TOOK POSITION LAST WEEK. NO I BOTTOM A WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. LEYVA RESERVE YOU WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM POLICY CENTER ALSO STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORTS. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. THIS DISCOUNT IS. TO GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME'S LAURA CURTIS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- WE ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND WITH REGARD TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER DEPARTMENT. WE ARE ONLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEE PROVISION THE REASONS BEING THAT WE FEEL THAT THE UNDERMINE CITY LOC PROCESS IN TWO WAYS FIRST IT UNDERMINES THE PROCESS OF THE DEAL AS HE BECAUSE MORE INDIVIDUALS. IF THEY'RE ALLOWED ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEE RECOVERY WILL FILE THE CLAIMS IN CIVIL COURT DIRECTLY BECAUSE MOST OF THESE CLAIMS ARE BROUGHT ON A CONTINGENCY FEE BASIS OF THE EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING TO LOSE WHAT THE ATTORNEY MIGHT. THE EMPLOYEE HAS NOTHING TO LOSE WITH FILING A CLAIM IN CIVIL COURT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO UP FRONT COST. THAT'S OUR FIRST CONCERN WITH THE DEAL AS HE PROCESS THE SECOND IS THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL AMBIGUITY WITH THE ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEES WERE THAT COULD BE RECOVERED THROUGH THE DEAL AS THE PROCESS ITSELF. RIGHT NOW THE DEAL AS THE PROCESS HOLDS THE EMPLOYEES HAND THEY WALK THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. THEIR INVESTIGATOR ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS THE EMPLOYER IS NOT ACTUALLY -- OFTENTIMES NOT PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT EVIDENCE OTHER OFTENTIMES NOT A PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO REMEDIATE THERE AT POTENTIAL FEES THAT MIGHT AT THE AT THE AMOUNT OF THE ATTORNEYS FEES AT THE PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY MIGHT BE BRINGING WITH THIS. CLAIM IF IT'S FILED WITH THE DALLAS EAT AND SO OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT IF MORE OF THESE CLAIMS ARE FILED BECAUSE OF THE ATTORNEYS FEES PROVISION THAN IT WOULD BE ALLOW FOR A MORE CONTENTIOUS DELISTED PROCESS. IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND IT'S ONLY ATTORNEYS FEES WITHIN THE CIVIL COURT THEN WE SEE MORE THESE CLAIMS BEING FILED DIRECTLY IN CIVIL COURT AND NOT UTILIZING THE DEAL AS THE PROCESS AND SO THESE POTENTIAL CLAIMS WOULD CLOG UP THERE -- CIVIL COURT AND SO THOSE ARE CONCERNS OVER ALL -- BUT WE ALSO AGREED -- FEEL THAT IF THERE ARE GOING TO BE ATTORNEYS FEES PROVISION ADDED IT SHOULD NOT BE ONE SIDED BOTH PARTIES SHOULD HAVE STUCK THE SAME STAKE IN THE CLAIM. THAT WILL DRIVE DOWN FOR FELIZ LITIGATION AND THAT'S OUR OVERALL CONCERN AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SINGER BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WE MISTER KALRA. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR -- AND I APPRECIATE -- THE THE CHAIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL COMMITTEE SUPPORT FOR THE BILL -- AND JUST JUST A COMMENT ON ON WHAT THE REALITY IS AND THE REALITY IS THAT -- BUT GIVEN THE FACT. THAT ATTORNEYS MAY LOSE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA REALLY HAVE -- AN ONSLAUGHT OF ATTORNEYS LOOKING FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS THAT IN GENERAL HAVE VERY -- ALTHOUGH POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT CLAIMS -- YOU HAVE BEEN TO GO AFTER IT AS CLIENTELE TO TAKE TO THE COURTS RIGHT NOW ON PLEASE REALLY I KNOW GENUINE ABILITY TO SEEK JUSTICE IN OUR COURT SYSTEM ONE OF THE FEW OUT TO USE THE HOT THEY HAVE. IS AN EGG IS OF WHAT. SILVERTONE DOES IN TERMS OF THE LAW CLINIC. AND GETTING SOME ATTORNEYS FEES ALLOWS A LAW CLINIC TO ACTUALLY REPRESENT MORE PEOPLE. AND AND ALLOWS THEM TO BE ABLE TO OFFER JUSTICE. TO WORKERS AND SO THAT'S WHY THE ATTORNEY FEES A PORTION IS SO IMPORTANT EIGHT IT WON'T. I HAD TO GREATER LITIGATION AGAIN BECAUSE ONLY THE PREVAILING SIDE WILL WIN AND THIS IS NOT LIKE OTHER TYPES OF CIVIL ACTIONS WERE THE POTENTIAL PAY OUT IS GOING TO BE ENORMOUS -- YOU KNOW I ATTORNEYS ARE VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO USING THEIR TIME ESPECIALLY IF THEIR GOAL IS TO MAKE MONEY -- THIS IS NOT THE ROUTE TO GO -- BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO BUY LOW WAGE WORKERS BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE UP WHAT IT WILL ALLOW FOR IS THOSE LAWYERS THAT ARE. ATTEMPTING TO HELP WORKERS SEEK JUSTICE TO BE ABLE LEASE GET SOME COMPENSATION TO ALLOW THEM TO REPRESENT MORE WORKERS AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ALLOW OF NON PROFITS CLINICS. SUCH AS THE ONE THAT MISSED OVER TOLD -- BUT RUNS AB TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT -- TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT -- MORE WORKERS AND GIVE THEM A VOICE AND IT WON'T STOP THE WORKERS FROM GOING BEFORE THE LABOR COMMISSION. AS WELL AND SO -- IN ANY CASE I I STRONGLY. ASKED THAT -- WITH THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND AND OTHERS LIKE IT THAT I HAD MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKERS TO SEEK JUSTICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHAU. CHIU GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA AYE KALRA AYE KILEY.

STILL USE PLASTIC IS ALSO ADDING TO OUR LANDFILLS THOSE TINY PLASTIC SHAMPOO BOTTLES AND OTHER PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS REPRESENT A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF WASTE. THAT CAN EASILY BE ELIMINATED THROUGH MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVES. SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO PROHIBITS A LODGING ESTABLISHED FROM PROVIDING SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLES CONTAINING CHRIS AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. TO A GAS ANY SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION. CURRENTLY -- THE BILL PROVIDES A THREE YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION DELAY TO GET BUSINESSES TIME TO DEPLETE THE CURRENT STOCK. INSTALL DISPENSERS ENSURE THAT DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLY AND OF X. I HAVE EXPRESSED TO THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE SMALLER ESTABLISHMENTS AN EXTRA YEAR TO COMPLY. GENTLY MANY BUSINESSES AND BRANDS THE HOTEL INDUSTRY -- ALREADY PHASING OUT THE SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLES IN FAVOR OF FOR IN FAVOR OF A FILLABLE DISPENSERS. BY NOT OFFERING SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLES OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS HOTELS MOTELS AND OTHER LODGING ESTABLISHMENTS WE CAN REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTIC CONSUMPTION AND INCREASE CONSUMER AWARENESS. ABOUT USE OF PLASTIC -- IN IN FACT THE REASON WHY WE SEE THE INDUSTRY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION IS IN MUCH PART DUE TO CONSUMER PREFERENCE. I'VE BEEN A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION. AND REALLY WANT TO THANK THEM -- FOR PRACTICALLY WORKING WITH US TO TRY TO RESOLVE AS MANY IMPENDING ISSUES WE MAY HAVE -- IT IS MY HOPE TO KEEP WORKING WITH INDUSTRY INCOME TO THE GOVERNMENT ARE MAKING IT CLEAR BUT PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE BILL. AND ENFORCEMENT END -- BUT IT'S IT'S ALSO. GOOD TO KNOW THAT THE INDUSTRY -- IS SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE THAT'S THE DIRECTION ARE GOING AND I THINK IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON ISSUES OF THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THIS IS ONE MORE EXAMPLE BECAUSE WE SEE THE INDUSTRY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION ALREADY. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES OF APPLYING A SAFE HARBOR USED FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING POSTING TO THIS BILL -- AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S PROGRESS TO CLARIFY WHICH PRODUCTS ARE COVERED THAT PROVISION WILL NOT BE NECESSARY. ALSO NOTHING IN THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT HOTEL GUESTS AND BRING IN THEIR OWN SMALL BOTTLE TOILETRIES PATEL FROM OFFERING CONVENIENCE ITEMS OUTSIDE THE ACCOMMODATION ROOM. WITH SO MANY VIABLE ALTERNATIVES PROVIDING SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLES OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS LIKE SHAMPOO THE LODGING INDUSTRIES IN A PRIME POSITION TO PHASE OUT THE PRACTICE. AND CONTINUE THEIR COMMITMENT TO ABOUT OF WHAT ABOUT AMOUNTS TO A SHIP A PRODUCING PLASTIC WASTE. AND BY SOME ESTIMATES THERE ARE AS MANY AS HALF A BILLION OF THESE LITTLE BOTTLES. THAT ARE PUT IN THE ROOMS IN CALIFORNIA IN JUST A SINGLE YEAR SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A SMALL ISSUE ARE SMALL PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH THE BOTTLES MAYBES. I WOULD BE PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS CAN HEY WHAT PRESIDENT OUR COMMUNITIES AND GENEVIEVE AVEDON REPRESENT THE CLEANS HIS LOBBYING COALITION. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE. HELLO THANK YOU GUYS -- FOR HAVE ME SPEAK HERE TODAY MY NAME'S KEN HAYWORTH AND FOUNDER INVENTOR AND PRESIDENT OF OUR COMMUNITIES WE ARE AN AMENITY FIXTURE MANUFACTURER BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT DOING BUSINESS ALL OVER THE WORLD. I'M IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN SIXTY TWO I BELIEVE THAT FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN OVER NINE YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY YES DECISION FOR ALL OF YOU. ENVIRONMENTALLY FOR THE PLANT WE'VE ALL SEEN THE PLASTICS ARE DOING TO OUR WORLD THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL WILL SAVE UP TO A THOUSAND SMALL BOTTLES. IN OVER FIVE GALLONS A PARTIALLY USE PRODUCT BECAUSE WE ONLY USE OF THOSE LITTLE BOTTLES AND ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN IN HOTELS -- FROM LANDFILLS PER ROOM PER YEAR ADDITIONALLY WILL CREATE ANCILLARY SAVINGS AND FREIGHT PACKAGING. WASTE REMOVAL AND RECYCLING FINANCIALLY FOR THE HOTELS IT'LL SAVE HER HOTELS BETWEEN THIRTY AND 45% FROM THEIR CURRENT AMENITY BUDGETS LIMITING THEIR FRIGHTENED PACKAGING LOWER IN THEIR WASTE AND RECYCLING BILLS. FURTHER IT LIMITS OPERATIONAL TIMELINES AS TO PLACING PIC REDELIVERY AND CLEAN UP OF THE SMALL BOTTLED. BOTTLES IN THE ROOMS. WE COME TO SEE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS A GREAT MOVEMENT ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WITH COMPANIES LIKE I. H. G. INTER CONTINENTAL HOTEL GROUP DISNEY MARRIOTT HYATT AND OTHERS PHASING OUT THE USE A SMALL BOTTLES WITH FOCUS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS YEAR ALONE I. H. G. CREATED A BRAND STANDARD FOR CANDLE WOULD STAY BRIDGE SUITES HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS AND EVEN HOTELS WILL SAVE. OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION PLASTIC BOTTLES AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND GALLONS A PARTIALLY USE PRODUCT FROM OUR LANDFILLS. IMAGINE A GALLON OF MILK FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND OTHERS. WITH FINANCIAL SAVINGS TO THOSE HOTELS OF OVER TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. ALSO WE SEEM TO BEEN CONTACTED BY MORE MORE FLAGS TO THE DESIRE TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION FOR THEIR MANY PROGRAMS. WE DON'T SEE THIS IS MERELY AN ECONOMICAL DECISION. WHICH IT CERTAINLY IS BUT MORE A SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL. ONE FROM A GUEST PERSPECTIVE DUE TO THE SAVINGS HOTELS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE A BETTER QUALITY PRODUCT FOR THE GUESTS AND FURTHER THAT FURTHER ENHANCES THE GUEST EXPERIENCE. AND WORKS IN TANDEM WITH THE ZERO A SOLUTION THAT THE GUESTS ARE EXPECTING -- THIS INCREASE IN DEMAND IS FORCED AMENITY DISPENSER COMPANIES LIKE MYSELF TO CREATE A BETTER GREATER DIVERSITY IN THE PRODUCT OFFERING IT'S NO LONGER IS THAT THE BOX OF GOO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER. THERE'S A A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT OUT ON THE MARKET -- AND FINALLY EVERY DAY WE HEAR ABOUT A PLASTIC IS INVADING OUR PLANET NOW THERE'S FIVE FLOATING ISLANDS. THE SIZE OF TEXAS ON OUR OCEANS AND WHAT THE COST WOULD BE. TO JUST CLEAN UP THE SURFACE OF OUR OCEANS SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT LIES BENEATH. YOU ALL HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A CHANGE TO NOT ONLY LIMITS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PLASTICS TO REACH OUR OCEANS BUT ALSO SAVES MONEY FOR THE PROPERTIES INCORPORATING IT. THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO. TODAY THAT WILL INCREASE THE SIZE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS POCKETS. AND HELP TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE I HOPE THAT YOU MAKE A DECISION IT MEANS SOMETHING. TO THIS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS AND SAY YES TO A. B. ELEVEN SIXTY TWO AND INSPIRE A POSITIVE CHANGE. THANK YOU TODAY FOR YOUR TIME AND HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME IN A SPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN SIXTY TWO THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS GENEVIEVE AVEDON AND I REPRESENT THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION THAT CONSISTS OF ELEVEN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THROUGH CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING HEAL THE BAY SURFRIDER FOUNDATION SAVE OUR SHORES AND MANY OTHERS -- AS YOU KNOW PLASTIC POLLUTION AFFECTS EVERY STREAM RIVER PARK AND STREET IN CALIFORNIA IT STARTS WITH FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION AND CONTINUES THROUGH MANUFACTURING TRANSPORTATION USAGE AND DISPOSAL. PLASTICS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN FOUND TO EMIT POTENT GREENHOUSE GASES THAT THE AS THEY BREAK DOWN. AND WITH THE PLAN 40% INCREASE IN PLASTIC PRODUCTION OVER THE NEXT DECADE UNLESS WE MAKE MAJOR POLICY CHANGES TO COUNTER THIS. PLASTIC PRODUCTION WILL ACCOUNT CONSUMPTION. ADDITIONALLY MICRO PASTA HAVE BEEN FOUND IN TAP WATER BOTTLED WATER TABLE SALT FISH SELF SHELLFISH AGRICULTURAL SOILS AT CETERA. ALL OF WHICH POSE A POTENTIAL THREAT TO HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. ALL OF THIS COMES WITH THE TREMENDOUS COST TO INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES ECOSYSTEMS AND WILDLIFE ALL ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN. CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SPEND OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND ONGOING EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LITTER. IN STREET STORM DRAINS PARKS AND WATER RATES. NOT ONLY IS THIS EXPENSIVE BUT IT CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH THE PRODUCTION OF SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE ITEMS WHICH CONTINUES TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY. NEITHER CAN EXISTING RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE WITH LESS THAN 9% OF PLASTIC HAVING BEEN RECYCLED AND THAT PERCENTAGE DROPPING SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WHICH IS SEVERELY RESTRICTED THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN WASTE THEY ACCEPT. COUNTLESS TINY BOTTLES OF SHAMPOO CONDITIONER LOTION AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE THROWN AWAY EVERY DAY BY THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THESE BOTTLES THE CRASH OF A RECYCLING MARKET AND THE FACT THAT MOST ARE DISCARDED WITH SOME AMOUNT OF PRODUCT STILL IN THEM. THEY ARE NOT RECYCLABLE IN MOST COMMUNITIES MORE SUSTAINABLE METHODS LIKE WALL MOUNTED DISPENSERS TO PROVIDE GUESTS WITH THESE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS EXIST AND ARE BEING USED AS I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN AS CAN HAS REFERRED. TO ALL COMMUNITIES SUCH AS SANTA CRUZ A MODERATE AREAS ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE ESTATE MIGHT MEASURE WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY APPROACH. THUS WE EAT RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE. FLOOR COMMON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT AND I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS THANK YOU. KILLER ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORTS. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION YEAH. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR JOHN CALLED ONE HALF THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION WE'RE WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO WHAT THE WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTO WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO -- WAIT WE THINK WE HAVE SOME VERY REASONABLE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE TALKED HIM ABOUT FIRST -- OUR INDUSTRIES A LEADER IN SUSTAINABILITY IN HAS DEMONSTRATED A HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT TANGIBLE COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP THE INTERNATIONAL. THE I. H. G. INTERNATIONAL CONTINENTAL HOTELS GROUP HAS RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SCORE FOR THE INDUSTRY. ON THE CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT HILTON HAS REDUCE LANDFILL WASTE BY 41% ACROSS MANAGED HOTEL SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HI IT HAS COMMITTED TO DIVERTING 40% OF ITS WASTE. FROM LANDFILLS MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL HAS SET A GOAL TO REDUCE ITS WAYS IT SOUNDS TO THE LANDFILLS BY. 45% BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO WE TAKEN RECOGNIZED IN INNOVATIVE STEPS TO CREATE A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE WHICH IS WHY WE ASK. FOR THIS COMMITTEE THIS AUTHORED IS TO CONSIDER SOME AMENDMENTS TO HELP. AB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO MEN MELD WITH THESE EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE SCOPE OF THE BILL BE LIMITED TO SHOWER OR BATH ACCESSORIES WHICH THE INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY BEGUN IN EARNEST OVER THE PAST DECADE. WITH SEVERAL HOTEL BRANDS ALREADY MOVING AWAY AS IT HAS BEEN DISCUSS FROM THE SINGLE YOU SHAMPOO CONDITIONER AND LIQUID SOAP. WE THINK -- THE DEFINITIONS AND MAKE MADE EXPAND MAY GO UP BEYOND THAT GROUP IN NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE -- THE CHAIR LAURA FRIEDMAN ASKED WHETHER MOUTHWASH WOULD BE COVERED TO FACE WILL BE COVERED YEAH AND THE WAY THE BILL'S WRITTEN TODAY PROBABLY YES. SO WE WOULD WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT -- SECONDLY THE BILL HAS TWO SECTIONS OF FOR ENFORCEMENT ONE SECTION WOULD HAVE THIS LAW ENFORCED BY CITY ATTORNEY COUNTY COUNCIL OR ATTORNEY GENERAL. WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT -- BUT THE BILL ALSO GIVES ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO QUOTE A STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY WITH AUTHORITY TO INSPECT SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THAT IS ON THE STATE LEVEL -- AND WITH FIVE HUNDRED CITIES IN FOR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES NOT CLEAR THAT'S GOING TO BE ON A LOCAL LEVEL WE THINK IT'S SEXUAL ONLY CAUSE CONFUSION WE SUGGEST A SECTION BE ELIMINATED IN THE ENFORCEMENT. IN THE BILL FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY THE COUNTY COUNCIL AND THE AGE YOU WERE REMAIN. WE HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR PREEMPTION OF LOW OF LOCAL ORDINANCES ENACTED AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL. NOT NOT SO WHAT WOULD NOT PREEMPT YEARS THAT THE SANTA CRUZ -- THE SANTA CRUZ ORDINANCE BUT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS ON A CITY CITY BY CITY BASIS AFTER THE INDUSTRY. HAS. COME UP WITH A DEAL HERE AND WE'VE PAID MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW -- AS A AS TALK ABOUT WE'VE REQUESTED A RIGHT TO CURE PROVISIONS SIMILAR TO WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING SIGNAGE LAW -- LASTLY WE REQUEST AN IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR ALL OF LODGING ESTABLISHMENTS WITH FIFTY ROOMS ARE MORE AND TWENTY TWENTY SIX FOR THE SMALLER ESTABLISHMENTS. THIS IS A LONGER THAN WHAT'S IN THE PRESS PRESENT BILL BUT OUR OUR OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME NOT ONLY. THE CONTRACTS THEYHAVE EXIST BUT MAKING THE TRANSITION BUT ALSO TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CONSUMER WANTS WHAT THE WHAT THE CONSUMER WANTS -- AGAIN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET A WOOD GOT THIS BILL GOT THIS LAW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WORK WITH WORK WITH THE AUTHOR WAS SO WE CAN PHASES WE CAN PHASE THIS BILL IN IN A MANNER THAT WORKS WITH THE PUBLIC. AND WORKS WITH THE THE INDUSTRY THANK YOU. EXCEPT FOR THIS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL A TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SMALL MEDIUM LARGE COSMETIC AND PERSONAL CARE COMPANIES. MANY OF THEM LOCATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ALSO HAVE TO REGISTER RESPECTFULLY ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL -- WE WOULD ALIGN OURSELVES WITH A SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE HOTEL INDUSTRY AS STATED -- BEFORE I GO INTO THAT I ALSO THINK I SHOULD NOTE THAT OUR INDUSTRY TO IS TAKING THE ISSUE OF SUSTAINABILITY VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE FORMED A THIRD PARTY COALITION GROUP -- CALLED THE SUSTAINABILITY -- IN PACKAGING IN BECAUSE MEDICS SPICE FOR SHORT. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES AROUND RECYCLABILITY COMPOSED ABILITY AND EVEN -- BIODEGRADE ABILITY OF THE THE BOTTLES THAT WE ARE USING SO WE'RE TAKING THIS ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY. THERE ARE ALSO TWO PENDING BILLS IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT LOOK AT THIS ISSUE MORE BROADLY -- AROUND PACKAGING AND AND PRODUCT PACKAGING IN PARTICULAR -- IN THE CITY'S SUSTAINABILITY THERE OF AND WE ARE ACTIVELY AND CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BILL SPONSORS -- ON THOSE TWO MEASURES -- WHERE WE ALIGN WITH THE HOTEL INDUSTRY AND THEIR CONCERNS IS NUMBER ONE WE'D LIKE? TO INCREASE OR PUSHED OUT IMPLEMENTATION DATE AS WELL NOT ONLY WELL THAT AID SOME OF THE SMALLER HOTEL CHAINS BUT IT WILL ALSO HELP SOME OF THE SMALLER AND MEDIUM SIZED. COSMETIC COMPANIES -- THAT AREN'T AS NIMBLE OR DON'T HAVE AS MUCH RESOURCES AS SOME OF THE LRGER MULTINATIONAL CONGLOMERATES THAT HAVE SET VERY AGGRESSIVE DATES FOR RELATIVE TO SUSTAINABILITY -- WE LIKE TO GIVE THE SMALLER MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES MORE TIME -- THE SECOND ISSUE IS WE ALSO ALIGNED WITH THE HOTEL INDUSTRY'S CONCERNS AROUND THE LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE PRODUCTS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND -- WHAT THE THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S -- SO CONDITIONER AT SHAMPOO LOTION BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE PRODUCTS WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND. THE SCOPE AND THEN LASTLY -- PERMISSION TO USE PROPS. YES -- THE THE BILL DEFINES THEY SMALL -- FOR PURPOSES OF BILL WHAT WHAT THE BILL WOULD BAN IS ANYTHING TWELVE OUNCES OR BELOW. AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE BILL WE ARE. NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT TWELVE OUNCES REALLY LOOKS LIKE HERE'S WHAT YOU'LL FIND IN MOST HOTELS WHICH IS ONE POINT TWO NOW ONE POINT TWO OUNCES. OR THERE ABOUTS AND THE BILL WOULD BAN -- PRODUCTS ANYTHING LESS THAN TWELVE LIEU ANSWERS OR BELOW. NOT MANY HOTELS ARE GIVING PATRONS THE SIZE OF A BOTTLE -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE PATRONS WHICH IS AROUND ONE POINT TWO OUNCS -- WE FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT APPROACH -- WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILLS -- POTENTIAL TO BAND THE HOTEL LOBBIES OR THAT THE GIFT SHOPS FROM SELLING PRODUCTS WHICH THEY OFTEN DO SO WITH THOSE A CLOSE MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST ON CAP KHIMIK YOU KEPT CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE NOTICE -- BUT WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS IN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED POSITION OUT WITH THE PERSON THANK YOU. WHEN CHAIR AT A REGULAR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ALSO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANKS? HELLO AFFECT WORKERS FOR THE SEMINAL BAND OF MISSION INDIANS THE TRIBE HAS -- TO OFF SITE -- OFF RESERVATION HOTELS WOULD BE AFFECTED AND WORKING WITH THE HOW THE AUTHOR HAS STAFF NOW WHEN WE HONOR OUR QUESTION AMENDMENTS OF THOSE OF THE INDUSTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE THE BRING IT BACK QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS YOUNGER. YEAH SO I GUESS WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT HERE'S LIKE WHY DO WE NEED A BAND EXACTLY RIGHT I MEAN. ONE I'M JUST NOT A BIG FAN OF OF BANDS -- AND YEAH I LIKE THESE THINGS MAN I I COLLECT THESE STUFF IN THE HOTEL ROOM TO BRING THEM HOME. AND IT SEEMS TO ME AND THIS IS JUST MY SUBJECTIVE OBVIOUS THI IS LIKE AN EASIER THING TO RECYCLE RIGHT LIKE. IS THIS YOU KNOW TO ME IT'S LIKE THAT'S THE THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WOULD TO ALONG WITH MY MILK JUGS INTO THE BLUE RECYCLE BIN YOU KNOW -- BUT THAT'S JUST ME RIGHT I MEAN SO IS THERE SOME DATA OUT THERE AND MAYBE YOU ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS IT SHOWS THAT. THESE ARE JUST NOT RECYCLED AT ALL THAT I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS THAT DATE AND MAYBE YOU CAN JUST. LAY THAT OUT FOR THE AND FEEL FREE TO FOLLOW UP. MY EXPERT TESTIMONY BUT A ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THE CONTAMINATION -- ISSUE -- THE INFO. MY UNDERSTANDING OF ACTUALLY FROM MY CITY COUNCIL DAYS THAT THERE'S A LOT ISSUE A CONTAMINATION RECYCLES CYCLES THAT FEDERAL BEING RECYCLABLE -- AND ALSO SIZE THE THE SMALLER THE ITEMS LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO BE -- ARE TO BE RECYCLED I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE EXACTED ON BOTTLES ITSELF HOWEVER I WILL SAY. THAT THE OWNERS THIS BILL CAME FROM -- INFORMATION HEARING THAT MR SHARE A HELD IN SANTA CRUZ AND THERE WAS A PRESENTATION THAT DID -- AND I'D BE HAPPY. TO FOLLOW UP AND AND GET SOME OF THE REPORTS THAT -- MIGHT LEAD TO THIS BEING ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS TO REDUCE PLASTIC WASTE THAT MAY HAVE MORE DATA OR MORE POTENTIAL INFORMATION AS TO THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUE. BY NO CONTAMINATION IS A BIG PART OF IT AS WELL AS THE SIZE THAT LEADS TO A LOWER LIKELIHOOD OF IT BEING RECYCLED. I'LL JUST ADD THAT ARE RECYCLING MARKET IS IS CRASHING I MEAN WE'RE IN A CRISIS ONLY NUMBER ONE TO NUMBER TWOS OR IF THERE'S A MARKET -- FOR AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CHINA RIGHT NOW YEAH YEAH. SO A LOT OF A LOT OF THESE ITEMS -- ESPECIALLY THE ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT WAS SHOWN EIGHT DON'T BELIEVE IS A ONE OR TWO SO IF YOU BUT THEN YOU RECYCLE BIN. IT'S JUST GOING TO CONTAMINATE RECYCLING IN EITHER GO TO LANDFILL -- BUILD UP IN IN THE RECYCLING CENTERS I ALSO HAVE THE TWINS YOU KNOW SO I I USE A LOT OF WIPES AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAD THAT PREVIOUS BILL. ANYWAY. IT WAS -- SO AND THEN IT SOUNDS LIKE THE INDUSTRY'S MOVING AWAY FROM THIS RIGHT LIKE IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY MOVING AWAY ALREADY. SO IF THEY'RE ALREADY KIND OF MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. YEAH I MEAN DO WE AGAIN WE NEED. AN ALL OUT BAN WELL I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENT BEFORE BY THE WAY IF THE IF INDUSTRY WASN'T AND WE ARE PUTTING THIS IN PLACE THE ARGUMENT WOULD BE WHILE YOU'RE ENFORCING SOMETHING THAT. WE DON'T WANT TO DO I THINK THAT IT'S A IT SHOULD BE. GOT MORE GREATLY APPRECIATED THAT A BILL COMES FOR THAT'S ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING THE CONTACT THAT'S ALREADY OCCURRING IN THE TRENDS THAT ARE OCCURRING. BY MAKING IT A STATEWIDE POLICY RATHER THAN HAVING JURISDICTIONS DO IT ONE BY ONE WHICH WHICH IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED THEY DISCUSSED MISSED CALL OTHER DAY. YESTERDAY -- OR RATHER THAN -- OF HAVING A DIFFERENT SET OF PROTOCOLS WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SIMPLY IS OKAY YOU'RE MOVING INSTRUCTION ANYWAY. LET'S MOVE FORWARD IT ALLOWS INDUSTRY -- ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP FACILITATE THE TRANSITION -- ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER HOTELS I HAD ALLOWS LARGER SHOULD HOTELS TO SET AN EXPECTATION AS TO HOW THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN SET UP -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE. TO A LIMITED AMOUNT OF CLASSES COMING IN OF PEOPLE BEING PRODUCED AN ENTRY ALWAYS STREAM AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY THINGS WE NEED TO DO -- IT'S ALIGNED WITH OTHER EFFORTS TO A TO MOVE AWAY FROM SEEN THESE PLASTIC IN OUR STATE THAT I KNOW THAT WHEN BURKE MANY MEMBERS BECAUSE ALSO OTHERS. ARE WORKING ON AND BUT YOU CAN HAVE THAT GOAL BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE ACTUALLY MORE SPECIFIC INITIATIVES TO ACTUALLY MOVE TOWARDS THAT GOAL. AND SO THIS IS AGAIN IT'S A PUBLIC POLICY. DEBATE AS TO WHETHER IT'S VALUABLE FOR US TO GET RID OF THESE SINGLE USE PLASTIC BOTTLES. TOILETRIES AND I JUST THINK THE FACT INDUSTRIES ALREADY MOVING THAT DIRECTION HOST OF ASSAULTED AND MAKES IT MORE VIBRANT WHY WE SHOULD DO IT. WITHOUT -- I WENT THANK YOU FOR THE BELL A AT THERE'S THE PERSONAL SIDE OF ME DOESN'T WANT HI LITTLE. BOTTLES TAKEN BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE TO TAKE THEM HOME -- CULTURAL. WE DON'T WASTE -- BUT BILLIONS OF WASTE IN THE SEVEN I'M TALKING ABOUT AT SO BUT I AM BUT I UNDERSTAND I MEAN THAT'S PERSON I KNOW 91% OF PLASTICS THAT WE PRODUCE DON'T GET RECYCLED AND SO WE WOULD THAT WE HAVE KIND OF A AT I NEED TO DO SOMETHING. I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT LIKE -- THE REQUEST LIKE AT THE FRONT DESK IF YOU FORGET TO PASTE MORE THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE AND ABLE TO BE GIVEN TO YOU IN A SMALL SIZE SO THAT WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE AS WELL AS THE THE HAS SHOPS THERE IN THE LOBBIES. THAT SELL SMALL SIZE PRODUCTS WILL ALSO STILL BE A BE AVAILABLE THIS IS JUST IN THE IN COMBINATION WITH ITSELF. OKAY -- IN THIS IS JUST HOTELS NOT SPAS. THIS IS A OF A LODGING YES THAT'S CORRECT Là LODGING ESTABLISHMENTS PLEDGE MISTER THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU I I'M OF THE BILL IF IT HAS BEEN MOVED IT HAS NOT BEEN MOVE THAT IS A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE MISTER CARR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND JUST RESPOND -- AND I I DO WANT TO THANK OPPOSITION I THINK THAT THE AGAIN BOTH WITH OVER THERE IS THE PERSONAL CARE INDUSTRY OR THE LODGING INDUSTRY. OTHER BOTH MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AND IN THE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AS FAR AS WERE CONCERNED -- SPECIFICALLY -- IN TERMS OF CLARA FIND DEFINITIONS AND I HAD A REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION YESTERDAY THIS CALL WELL ABOUT IT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS BUT I DO AGREE I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE GREATER CLARIFICATION. AS TO BOTH OF THE WITNESSES ARE CONCERNS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT TO HAVE A MORE CLARITY IN TERMS DEFINITIONS -- WE ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE I THINK THE ADDED SOME CLARITY IN ONE REGARD BUT CRITICS ON CONFUSION OTHER SUB GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. AND IN TERMS OF THE THE ISSUE OF LOCAL VERSES OTHER ENFORCEMENT THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THE LOCAL -- WHETHER IT'S COUNTY PUBLIC CALL FOR OF LOCAL CULTURES IS -- THE REALITY IS PRAGMATICALLY THEY'RE THE ONES ARE MORE LIKELY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE. TO SEE AND IDENTIFY THE FACT THAT A HOTEL -- MAY NOT BE COMPLYING AND LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT IN THAT CASE THE FIRST VIOLATIONS A WARNING LETTER SO IT WE'RE NOT INTENDED TO BE PUNITIVE. IT IN THAT REGARD WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ONCE THE AND THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED THAT IT COULD BE RECTIFIED IN A WAY THAT. THAT'S AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AND AGAIN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE ADDED AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADD -- EXTEND THE TIMELINE TO THREE YEARS AND WORK WE'VE UP IN -- ON THE RECORD HERE ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT WILL EXTEND INTO FOUR YEARS FOR SMALLER ESTABLISHMENTS AND WE THINK THAT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT I WILL GET PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT ADJUSTMENT. AND IN TERMS OF PREEMPTION THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WAS FIRST AT LEAST IN DIALOGUE BROUGHT UP YESTERDAY BUT WE HAD A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION ON THAT I THINK COULD BE SOMETHING THAT -- WE COULD WORK ON IN TERMS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF NOT HAVING LOCAL ORDINANCES IF WE COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT WE BELIEVE MAKE SENSE. THAT -- THERE COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL PREEMPTION BUT AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION THAT WE GOT A LOT OF DIALOGUE. THE ENTIRE PROCESS AND I WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT EVEN IN BEFORE THIS BILL IS EITHER INTRODUCED I SAT WITH THE HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION TO DISCUSS IT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND SO. I DO APPRECIATE OPPOSITION WITH THAT ASK FOR AND I'M UP AND WHEN I BUILT THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER.

GOOD MORNING MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND STAFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A. B.. THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WHICH IS A POLICY THAT STANDS UP FOR AND DEFENDS AND PROTECTS OUR IMMIGRANTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA CONSISTENT WITH SB FIFTY FOUR ARE SANCTUARY STATE ACT. FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT. NO CITY OR COUNTY OR STATE JURISDICTION SHALL DO. SO HAVE A CONTRACT TO DO BUSINESS WITH A A COMPANY. THAT. ENGAGES IN DATA BROKE GREEN OR EXTREME VETTING OR TO DENT DETENTION FACILITY SUPPORT THAT LEADS TO THE DEPORTATION. OR DETENTION OF OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS AND THE COMPANIES. CAN MAKE A DECISION AND AND NOT SHARE DATA. IN ASSIST ARM ICE OR THE CALIFORNIA BORDER PATROL IN WHICH CASE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH US BUT IF THEY DO THEN THAT UNDERMINES IT IS AN AND RUN IN A LOOP HOLE AROUND A SANCTUARY STATE PROVISIONS. I WE YES IT WE ARE SEXUALLY USING A STATE TAX DOLLARS. TO DEPORT DETAIN. IMMIGRANTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WE TOOK SOME A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO HELP. MAKE THE PROCESS LESS BURDENSOME ON LOCALS THAT WERE I AM. EXPRESSING SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT NOW THE DOJ WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND PUBLISHING A LIST OF COMPANIES. THAT PROVIDE PROHIBITS SERVICES TO FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AGENCIES WE ALSO HAVE A COMPONENT OF THE BILL THAT. ALLOWS -- OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES TO DO BUSINESS WITH COMPANIES WHEN THERE IS NO REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE. I THINK THESE ARE ALL APPROPRIATE STEPS TO MAKE THE BILL I'M MORE AND IMPLEMENTABLE AND MORE PRACTICAL. I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK MISTER CHAIR -- AND YOUR STAFF WORK I WITH MY TEAM A TO HELP GET THE BILL TAB WHERE IT IS WITH THE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT IT HAS -- AND TO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE VOTE. I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT BRIAN HOPE. FOR SECURE JUSTICE LES LOVERS ABI CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AND MAHMOUD TO REACT COUNCIL OF ON ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS. THANK YOU SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THE MEMBERS ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS YOU'RE TAKING AS AUTHORS AND TAKEN. THANK YOU PERFECT RIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. HONORABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRIAN HOPE FOR AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SECURE JUSTICE ALPHA CHAIR OAKLAND PRIVACY COMMISSION. I WANT TO THANK MEMBER BONTA AND IS LEGISLATIVE AIDE GRAHAM DRAKE FOR WORKING WITH OUR COALITION. AND YOUR WONDERFUL CONSULTANT JUST MAKING A CENT THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME INVADE YOUR WEEKEND -- I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS BILL WHICH CAME FROM TWO OF MY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS AT WORK IN SEPARATE FINANCIAL AID OFFICES. THERE IS SHARING WITH ME THE pAND GPS PROTECTED STUDENTS FROM APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID. BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS WERE SCARED TO PROVIDE DATA TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AROUND THE SAME TIME IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERVISOR SHARED WITH ME THE RESULTS OF THE LOCAL HEALTH CARE ENROLLMENTS. AS A COUNTIES LARGE IMMIGRATION POPULATION CHOSE TO FOREGO HEALTH CARE THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO BY OPERATION OF LAW. RATHER THAN PROVIDE DATA TO THE FEDS. IMAGINE BEING THOSE PARENTS CHOOSING TO REJECT HEALTH CARE AND FINANCIAL AID FOR YOUR KIDS BECAUSE YOU'RE TERRIFIED THAT THEY ARE YOU WILL BE DEPORTED. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A QUOTE FROM A RECENT LEGISLATIVE EFFORT I WORKED ON WAS -- BART. PART WAS FOUNDED SHARE DATA WITH ICE THERE CENTURY TRANSIT DISTRICT. PUT IT IN A MERCURY NEWS CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT IS JUSTICE ALLIANCE THE WORD SANCTUARY HAS LOST A LOT OF ITS STRENGTH. TRUST IN ANY STATE AGENCY TO FULLY SUPPORT THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY THROUGH CENTURY FARCES IT'S SOMETHING WE ARE NO LONGER GAMBLING WITH. THIS IS OUR CONCERN THIS BILL IS STRAIGHT FORWARD IF YOU PROVIDE SPECIFIC SERVICES TO FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AGENCIES YOUR INELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ARE SCARCE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THIS WOULD BETTER ALIGN OUR BUDGET WITH OUR VALUES. THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT PURSUANT TO A BE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE STATE ALREADY USES ITS ECONOMIC POWER IN SUPPORT LGBT Q. FOLKS. PROHIBITING STATE FUNDED OR STATE SPONSORED TRAVEL TO CERTAIN STATES WITH DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AND WE'RE ASKING YOU TO CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. THE DOJ IS NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR IT -- UNDER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE DOJ IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING THE LIST OF OFFENDING STATES. MANY LOCALITIES HAVE ADOPTED ANTI NUCLEAR WEAPONS ORDINANCES BORDER WALL CONTRACTOR PROHIBITIONS AND SIMILAR TRAVEL BANS -- THOSE LOCALITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMPLY AND REVIEW CONTRACTS WITHOUT HURTING THEIR BUDGETS -- RICHMOND ENACTED A SOMEWHERE Là LAST JUNE BERKELEY IS EXPECTED TO DO SO TONIGHT WE'RE ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. OAKLAND WILL BE VOTING ON MAY FOURTEENTH. MY PUBLIC RECORD REQUEST SHOW THAT TWO TO THREE CONTRACTS AT ISSUE -- PER CITY IS THE AVERAGE COUNTIES WITH JAILS WOULD HAVE FIVE TO SIX CONTRACTS THERE ARE BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF VENDORS IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES. BY HAVING TO DO J. IDENTIFY THAT LAST LOCAL ENTITIES ARE RELIEVED OF THE BURDEN. BY THE DOJ FIRST NOTIFYING THOSE COMPANIES IT SHIFTS THE BURDEN TO THEM TO PROVE THEY DO NOT PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES. BY HAVING THIS PROHIBITION AND LOCAL CONTRACTING SOLICITATIONS NOTICES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE ASSURE THAT RESPONSE OF BIDDERS ARE QUALIFIED AND NOT PROVIDING SUCH SERVICES. WE ALL KNOW OUR WORLD WAR TWO HISTORY. THAT SEEMINGLY BENIGN DATA COLLECTED BY CENSUS BUREAU'S WAS USED BY BOTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS TO TARGET CERTAIN POPULATIONS. WE HAVE THESE LOOPHOLES ARE GAPS IN OUR EXISTING CENTURY STATUTES AND WE'RE ASKING YOU TO HELP FILL THEM. WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THAT LAY LOWER IS THAT THE WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. I AM PROUD TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY OUR ORGANIZATION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SUPPORTED PROUDLY SB FIFTY FOR THE CALIFORNIA VALUES ACT WHICH WAS PASSED INTO LAW AND HAS BEEN. DUBBED BY THE MEDIA FOR BETTER OR WORSE AS BEST STATE SANCTUARY LAW -- THE SIMILARLY A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO WOULD MAKE IMPORTANT STEPS IN EXTENDING THE PROTECTIONS IN SB FIFTY FOUR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TRULY REALITY FOR ALL OF OUR STATES RESIDENTS. WERE BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE OF PRIVATE CORPORATE DATABASES AND THE WAYS THOSE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO COMPROMISE THE PRIVACYINTERESTS OF OUR STATES IMMIGRANTS. IN PARTICULAR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS -- AS WELL AS FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN GRANTED A TEMPORARY LAWFUL PRESENCE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS WOULD INCLUDE POPULATIONS SUCH AS STOCK -- THAT ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE IN THESE TIMES -- CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HASAN OPERATING BUDGET OF FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND IT IS EVER GROWING. 10% OF THAT MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TOWARDS DATA MANAGEMENT SO THAT'S TO SAY 10% OF THAT MONEY. GOES TOWARDS PURCHASING THE PRIVATE INFORMATION OF RESIDENCE -- IN OUR STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE LARGEST IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WERE ALSO HOME TO SILICON VALLEY -- AMAZON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST NOTED AND REPORTED UPON OFFENDERS IN TERMS OF SELLING AND PARTICIPATING -- IN THIS DETENTION AND DEPORTATION SCHEMA AND SO WE THINK THAT THERE IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AND RESPONSIBILITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP BY EXTENDING THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE AFFORDED TO OUR STATE IT CITIZENS AT TO OUR RESIDENTS WITH RESPECT. TO PROTECTING THEIR PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS -- WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES AND EXTENDING THAT TO THE VIRTUAL ROUND BY PROTECTING THEIR PRIVATE DATA AS WELL AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S THAT IS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WITH THE AREA FROM THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC RELATIONS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS THE SANCTUARY STATE WE CURRENTLY LIMIT LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AGENCIES. YEAH OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS CONTINUE TO BE USED TO SUPPLY TECHNOLOGY AND DATA THAT ARE THEN USED ON ONE OF OUR POPULATIONS. BY THOSE VERY SAME AGENCIES. NOW THERE'S NO SURPRISE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST FROM AMERICAN AND COMMUNITY WITH THE INFLUX OF SURVEILLANCE. EXTREME VETTING AND THE RISE OF HATE CRIMES THAT ARE FAR GREATER TODAY THAN THEY WERE AFTER. NINE ELEVEN CURRENTLY OUR COMMUNITY IS RIDDLED WITH FBI AND ICE INFORMANTS.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING I THINK IT'S STILL MORNING. A ROB WHICH SHE FOR THE CUSTOMER OF COMMERCE -- AND WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AS A JOB KILLER -- BECAUSE IT WOULD FORCE. RESPECTED INDUSTRY STANDARD BUSINESSES OUT OF CALIFORNIA BASED ON WHAT. WE'VE DISAPPEAR OF VAGUE -- BLACKLIST -- WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR SPEAKING TO US WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE AND WE APPRECIATE THAT TME HOWEVER OUR PRIMARY CONCERN STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. ON TO CLARIFY SOME WHAT WHAT WE DO IS MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S HEARTFELT AND AND EVERYONE HEARS A HEARTFELT CONCERN ABOUT THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY. ON HOWEVER AND AND WE DO NOT OPPOSE THIS SET OF ANY SUPPORT FOR THAT POLICY THIS BILL IS MUCH BROADER THAN THAT POLICY IS MUCH MORE TROUBLING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- SO -- FIRST THAT'S DEAL WITH THIS BEING A A PRECISE OR OR DETAILED BLACKLIST THAT IS NOT THE CASE OF THE BLACKLIST IS TO FIND TWO WAYS. BY WHETHER OR NOT A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT YOU WOULD CONTRACT WITH PROVIDES IMMIGRATION RELATED SERVICES -- THAT TERM IS NOT CLEARLY DEFINED AND AS A COMMON SENSE WOULD SAKE SURE IT INCLUDES ICE OR SEE KEEP A CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL. BUT DEPARTMENT STATE ISSUES IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS TO PART OF EDUCATION TEACHES CLASSES -- DEPART OF JUSTICE HILLS IMMIGRATION COURTS SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A SMALL DEFINED LIST OF JUST ICE CAN'T WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANYONE A CONTRACT WITH HUGE SUAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOW HAVING -- THE CONCERNS UP BY THAT THEY CAN DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA -- AND WITH RESPECT TO THE MOMENT KICKING THAT TO DOJ -- COULD NOT TO THE JUST NOT ADDRESS OUR CONCERN BECAUSE THE DOJ WILL CONFRONT THE EXACT SAME VAGUE LANGUAGE WHICH IS IN FRONT OF US TODAY. AND THEY WILL BE ASK WHAT IS IMMIGRATION RELATED AND THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO AVOID THE FACT THAT OUR STATE AND MANY OTHERS ARE INVOLVED IN -- AS TO THE SCALE OF THE COMPANY'S COVERED -- BECAUSE THE BLACKLIST WOULD BE CITIES SO BAG IT'S HARD FOR US TO EVEN AS A BUSINESS COMMUNITY. ASSESS HOW MANY BUSINESSES WOULD BE COVERED BY THIS AND EVEN WHAT SECTORS -- THE WHAT WE DO KNOW IS PRESUMABLY MANY MANY TECH COMPANIES TO BE COVERED BECAUSE THE BILL TARGETS. COMPANIES THAT GATHER DATA OR ANALYZE DATA -- BUT SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE AUTHORS -- INITIAL DRAFT RECITALS DID YOU EXAMPLES OF REALLY HOW CATACLYSMIC THE IMPLICATIONS OF OF THIS BILL WOULD BE TO ANYONE OPERATING ON PUBLIC AND IN CALIFORNIA. BY FORBIDDING BASIC NECESSARY INDUSTRY WIDE STANDARDSERVICES. MICROSOFT. I'M I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM AND I I CAN'T SEVERAL BY SOON WE ALL USE -- MICROSOFT WORD MICROSOFT OUTLOOK. MICROSOFT TO BE OFF LIMITS UNDER THIS BILL BECAUSE MICROSOFT HAS AN A. I. THAT ANALYZES DATA FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO EVERY PUBLIC AND IN CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED TO FIND A NEW EMAIL SERVER -- AND I'LL DEAL WITH THE REASON ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE LATER BUT THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT -- THOMSON REUTERS LEXIS NEXIS AT THREE OTHER ATTORNEYS IN THIS ROOM WE ALL KNOW THAT A LEXIS NEXIS WESTLOWER FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTAL PROJECTS. THEY ALSO BE OFF LIMITS INTO THIS BILL BECAUSE THOSE COMPANIES ACCUMULATE THAT. IBM JUST AS MENTIONED AMAZON I DON'T KNOW -- YEAH I CAN'T PROJECT FOR YOU THE VOTE THE BREATH HERE BECAUSE THE VEGAS THE TERMS BUT WE'RE TALKING UP FOR BIDDING BASIC INDUSTRY WIDE SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA -- LET'S SEE -- NEXT APPOINTMENT TOUCH ON IS THAT THE THIS IS IN MANY WAYS OVER KILL THE MAY HAVE NO POINT -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TARGETING A FEDERAL POLICY WHICH WAS PUT IN FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND COULD BE CHANGED TOMORROW IF TRUMP WANTED TO OR CHANGED AT THE NEXT ELECTION TWENTY TWENTY AND PUTTING A CALIFORNIA LAW PROHIBITION. BASED ON THAT SO LET'S JUST SAY TRUMP WAS THE ELECTION TWENTY TWENTY THIS BILL GOES INTO EFFECT IN THE LAW ON THE BOOKS MAKING CONTRACTING CALIFORNIA THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. WHEN THE POLICY IS GONNA? SO IT IS ALSO JUST THAT IN THAT WAY THE WRONG RESPONSE. AB I THINK IT WAS TEN SEVENTY NINE THAT JUST CAME UP THAT DEALS WITH ICE IMPLICATIONS WE YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND THAT AND BECAUSE WE ARE NOT OPPOSED. TO FOR YOU KNOW DEALING WITH FEDERAL POLICY THE CHAIR DID NOT WEIGH IN BUT THIS IS WELL BEYOND. THAT AREA OF CONCERN IT'S JUST THE WRONG RESPONSE -- AND WE'RE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION GOING AROUND ABOUT THIS BILL BUT FOR INTEREST OF TIME AND WE'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME -- I WILL STOP THERE AND PASSES OVER -- TO TO DANGER WITH THE PUBLIC PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU THANK GOODNESS PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON HAD CHAIR MEMBERS OF NOT QUITE YET DâN HUTCHINGS DELETED CALIFORNIA CITIES -- WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE THE ATTEMPTS MADE BY THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO ADDRESSING CONCERNS. THE MEASURE AS WAS STATED CRACK CREATES A A BLACK LIST OF% COMPANIES THAT IS ALL TO FIND AN OVERLY BROAD I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION. TO SECTION SEVENTY TWO EIGHT THREE POINT FIVE ONE WHICH PROVIDES REALLY AN ALL ENCOMPASSING CABBIE OUGHT -- FOR IMMIGRATION RELATED SERVICES WHICH REALLY YOU KNOW IT SAYS THAT YEAH DO YOU KNOW MAY INCLUDE BUT IS NOT LIMITED -- TO IT IN OUR ASSESSMENT IT COULD ACTUALLY SPEND ALL FOREIGN FORTY FIVE AGENCIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE DON'T WANT TO DO AND SO BY BY DOING BY BEING SO BROAD -- IT IMPEDES LOCAL AGENCIES ABILITY TO DO LEGAL RESEARCH -- DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM LAWSUITS WOULD HINDER LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO ENTER EVEN POLICE REPORTS INTEGRATING THAT WITH OUR NAME A ONE DISPATCH SYSTEMS -- THERE IS A A POTENTIAL LOSS OF OF GRANT FUNDING OR COMPLETING NEW APPLICATIONS DO A LACK OF ACCESS TO RESEARCH TOOLS BANNED BY THE BILL -- UP FOR IT ALSO FORCES EACH AGENCY TO REVIEW EVERY CONTRACT PURCHASE ORDER YOU KNOW EVEN SMALL CITIES AFFECT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BY PURCHASE ORDERS AND AND AND IN IN CONTRACTS THEY MAY ISSUE. IT'S GONNA HAVE TO HAVE US GO OUT THERE AND REVIEW AND ENSURE THAT WERE NOT ON YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH. THE LISTING TERM BY THE DOJ -- ADDITIONALLY ALTHOUGH IT YOU THAT THE BURDEN HAS BEEN PLACED ON DOJ TO ESTABLISH THIS LESSON DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION OR DIDN'T VACATION FOR CITIES WHO ARE STILL VERY VERY MUCH -- LIABLE I SHOULD THEY SHOULD THEY YOU KNOW NOT K&lt;c.cyan&gt; CONFORM WITH&lt;/c&gt; THE EVER CHANGING SORT OF BLACK LET'S THAT IS BEING CREATED BY DOJ -- YOU KNOW IT ALSO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE FIND YOU KNOW THIS MUCH IS THE THE SPONSORS. IS VERY NARROWLY SCOPED IF YOU LOOK AT SEVEN TWO EIGHT THREE POINT FIVE SIX THE BILL IT CLEARLY SAYS THAT ALL-- STATURE TO BE INTERPRETED BROADLY TO EFFECTUATE THE THE TIP TO EFFECTUATE THE CHAPTER THAT SCARES US. BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE MOST BROADEST POP POSSIBLE TERMS HOW CAN THIS BE IMPACTED THIS IS NOT NEARLY IN SCOUT -- SO ALL TOLD A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY TWO BUT STILL EMPTY THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO LEGAL RESEARCH IT WOULD IMPEDE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO UTILIZE A BEST AVAILABLE TOOLS TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE -- IT WOULD HARM AGENCIES ABILITIES TO FINANCIAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS I WILL INCREASE THE WORKLOAD -- AND DRIVE A COST INCREASE DECISIONAL -- AVENUES FOR THE EDUCATION. FOR OUR CITIES COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS -- AND AND AGAIN ALL OPPOSED BY SAYING WE ARE WE ARE IN A VERY PRECARIOUS MOMENT IN TIME YEAH I'M AYE AND ON TOP OF ALL MY OTHER DUTIES ON THE FEDERAL POLICY THE IS ON FOR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SO I DEAL WITH ARE. SOME OF THAT THE ISSUES WE HAVE FEDERALLY EVERYONE FED IN IN DC JUST.

EIGHT GOVERNMENT HAS. ALLOWED OUR DATA TO BE SHARED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- UNDER A VARIETY OF OF THE PROVISIONS IN OUR LAW WE WE HAD A MEETING YESTERDAY WITH THE DOJ M.

BUT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE STRUCTURES AND LAWS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ONCE WE GET A MORE RATIONAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE GONNA PUT PROBABLY HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIGURE OUT.

NOW FEAR IS UNDERMINING THE AB SIXTY LICENSE PROGRAM AND IT SHOULD. RECENT REPORTS HAVE UNCOVERED THAT ICE HAS BEEN ACCESSING STATE RUN DATABASES CONTAINING INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITH LICENSES THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER AB. SIXTY THIS BILL PROHIBITS CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM MAKING THEIR DATABASES INCLUDING. THOSE MAINTAINED BY PRIVATE VENDORS A BELT AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. THIS WOULD NOT APPLIED INFORMATION WITHIN THOSE DATABASES ON INDIVIDUALS WITH AN ACTIVE ARREST WARRANT ONE FORSMAN AGENCIES WITH ACCESS TO CLASS ARE. ALLOWED TO ACCESS CERTAIN INFORMATION FROM A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR IDENTIFICATION CARD RECORDS INCLUDING NAME DATE OF BIRTH RESIDENTS AND OR MAILING ADDRESS AND PHOTOS AS WELL. AS ANY PREVIOUS ARREST INFORMATION ACCIDENTS IN ANY LICENSING ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE DMV THE DMB ASSERTS THAT DOES NOT RELEASE ANY APPLICANT DOCUMENTS EXCEPT IN RESPONSE TO A CRIMINAL SUBPOENA.
