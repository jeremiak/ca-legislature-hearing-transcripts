00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.751
THERE ARE TWO PROVISIONS THE

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.486
FIRST WOULD AUTHORIZE C. SACK TO

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.154
UPDATE ITS AWARDING PROTOCOLS TO

RECEIVE FUNDS AT THE BEGINNING

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.425
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WHEN FUNDS

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:13.626
ARE MOST NEEDED.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.228
TYPICALLY THE PROCESS TAKES A

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.597
VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.098
CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROTOCOL.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.934
RESULTING IN STUDENTS RECEIVING

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.102
THEIR AWARDS AT THE END IS THAT

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.437
LATE IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR.

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.705
I WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO WOULD

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.640
AUTHORIZE C. SACK TO AWARD MORE

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.075
THAN THE TOTAL ALLOCATION AT THE

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:30.109
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.477
KNOWING THAT STUDENTS WILL

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.211
ULTIMATELY NOT CLAIM THEIR

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:33.780
AWARDS SO THAT MORE STUDENTS CAN

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.148
RECEIVE FUNDS IN THE BEGINNING

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.082
OF THE YEAR.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.417
THIS PROCESS HAS ALREADY BEEN

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.053
USED EFFECTIVELY FOR THE

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.187
COMPETITIVE CAL GRAHAM.

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:41.754
THE SECOND PROVISION WOULD

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:42.755
PROVIDE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:43.756
FOR FOSTER YOUTH.

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.498
IN THEIR FIRST YEAR AND ONE YEAR

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.866
IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.435
JUDGE OF A FOSTER YOUTH CAN BE

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.769
SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:59.038
GIVEN HOW MANY CHALLENGES THE

00:03:59.105 --> 00:03:59.606
STUDENTS FACE IN THEIR FIRST

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:00.373
YEAR.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.075
ONCE ALL FINANCIAL AID IS LOST

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.710
THE LIKELIHOOD OF REMAINING AND

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.078
ROLL DROPS PRECIPITOUSLY.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:06.646
UNLIKE MOST STUDENTS THESE ARE

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:07.747
STUDENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE A

FAMILY HOME TO RETURN TO WIN

FINANCIAL AID IS A LOST.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.218
A MORE LIKELY SCENARIO FOR THE

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:13.653
STUDENTS IS HOMELESSNESS AND

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.388
DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.322
ALLOWING THE STUDENTS TO

ADDITIONAL YEAR WILL PROVIDE A

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:20.860
BRIDGE THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.161

HAD TO GET MY GPA UP.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.077
AT AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL BEFORE

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:19.746
THE SCHOOL COULD GIVE ME ANY

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:20.980
FINANCIAL AID.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.148
DURING THAT TIME I HAD TO WORK

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.249
FOR OLD FULL TIME IN ORDER TO

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.284

ONCE I APPROVED FOR FINANCIAL

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:29.956

BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO ACTUALLY

SB ONE FIFTY MEANS A LOT TO US

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.388
HERE JAY BAY AND I BELIEVE MANY

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:36.088
OTHER FOSTER YOUTH.

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.557
I PERSONALLY HAD.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:37.990
GONE THROUGH.

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.158
THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AT THE

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.394
AGE OF FIFTEEN AND THEN GOT

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.929
PLACE TO MANY DIFFERENT TIMES.

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.363
AND WENT THROUGH A GROUP HOME

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.165
FIRST THAT HAD.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.434
PLACED ME AT A A SCHOOL THAT WAS

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.102
MORE CONVENIENT BECAUSE MANY

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:50.736
OTHER GIRLS IN THE GROUP PALMER

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:51.504
GOING THERE.

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.806
SO THAT'S KIND OF SET ME BACK A

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:55.508
LITTLE BIT MY EDUCATION

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:56.943
DISCOURAGE ME TO FINISH AND

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.578
ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE TURNING

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.013
EIGHTEEN MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.648
SHE HAD -- HAD A DECISION TO

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:03.983
MAKE IN A SEPARATE COURT AND

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.284
CRIMINAL COURT WHETHER SHE'S

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:07.320
GOING TO GO DOWN FROM A FELONY

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:08.888
OR PROBATION.

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.156
SO I HAD A DECISION TO EITHER

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.791
REUNIFY WITH HER NOT AND IT KIND

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.192
OF HELPED HER CASE IN CRIMINAL

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.528
COURT SO. FOR ME I DECIDED TO

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.764
REUNIFY WITH HER -- BECAUSE SHE

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.333
IS STILL MY BIOLOGICAL MOM.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.667
HOWEVER IT DID JUST CALL FROM

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:23.302
FIVE ME FROM LIKE AB TWELVE OR

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.538
OTHER HOUSING PROGRAMS SO AFTER

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:27.807
I TURNED EIGHTEEN I WAS ELIGIBLE

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:30.042
TO DO THOSE -- AND STAY IN THOSE

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:30.643
TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND I KNEW

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.178
WHAT I ATE REUNIFIED WITH HER

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:34.280
THAT I WASN'T GOING TO GET

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.748
SUPPORT AFTER THE AGE OF

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:36.382
EIGHTEEN BUT I MADE THAT

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.317
DECISION ANYWAYS AND I STRUGGLED

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:39.018
WITH IT.

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:40.319
AND EVENTUALLY WENT BACK TO

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:41.954
ADULT SCHOOL AND I GOT MY

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.457
DIPLOMA AFTER A LONG TIME.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.591
IT WAS NOT EASY.

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.260
AND I IT WAS ONLY FIVE CREDITS

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:49.161
AWAY TOO SO IT WASN'T TOO

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:51.197
TEDIOUS AND AFTER THAT I ALSO

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:54.300
ENROLLED IN THE LOCAL JUNIOR

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.235
COLLEGE WHICH WAS NOT THE

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:56.836
EASIEST PROCESSED.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:57.536
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I WAS IN

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:58.504
FOSTER CARE AND FRESNO COUNTY

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.739

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.141
MODESTO SO GETTING THAT APPROVED

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.776
AND ALL OF THAT WAS DIFFICULT SO

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.278
TO GET MY CHIEF YOU RIGHT AWAY.

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.246
AND THAT WOULD HAVE KIND OF HELP

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.182
ME AND ALSO BEING HOMELESS WAS

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:11.384
KIND OF A STE.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.785
KIND OF DIFFICULT.

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:13.986

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:33.673
MORE FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR ME

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:37.243

TIME AS A COLLEGE STUDENT AND

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:46.016
WHY I THINK THE PASSAGE OF FIVE

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:47.017
SIXTY EIGHT IS SO IMPORTANT.

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:48.719
I SPENT EIGHTEEN YEARS IN THE

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.087
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AS A RESULT

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.254
OF BOTH OF MY PARENTS BEING

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:52.589
INCARCERATED AND FACING LIFE

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:53.957
SENTENCES.

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:55.692
MY EARLY YEARS WERE CHALLENGING

COUNTIES AWAY.

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:11.041
EACH TIME I MOVED I WAS FORCED

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:13.977
TO CHANGE SCHOOLS WHICH LEFT ME

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.846
FAR BEHIND ACADEMICALLY.

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:16.446

ALTHOUGH NOT FOR THE REASON MOST

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:20.917
IT. FOR ME SCHOOL WASN'T OUTLET

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:22.619
TO ESCAPE THE PHYSICAL ABUSE

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:24.454
THAT I ADORED BY THOSE WHOSE JOB

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:27.023
IT WAS TO PROTECT ME.

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:28.558
AS I APPROACH HIGH SCHOOL

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.060
GRADUATION I WANTED TO GO TO

MYSELF THAT I COULD DO IT.

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.599
BY THE GRACE OF GOD I WAS ABLE

00:50:35.665 --> 00:50:36.967
TO COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL AT THE

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:39.202
AGE OF SEVENTEEN AND FILL MY

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:39.770
DREAM OF BECOMING A COLLEGE

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.171

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:43.106

THE DREAM HOWEVER AGAINST

00:50:45.275 --> 00:50:47.010
REALITY IT WAS AGAINST REALITY

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:49.679
WHEN I TURNED EIGHTEEN I FOUND

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:51.214
MYSELF WITH NO PLACE TO LIVE.

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.749
AS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WITH NO

00:50:52.816 --> 00:50:54.351
SAVINGS NO CREDIT HISTORY AND NO

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:56.853
ADULT SUPPORT FOR ME TO FIND

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.622
HOUSING I FOUND MYSELF HOMELESS.

00:50:58.688 --> 00:50:59.689
I SPENT THREE MONTHS SLEEPING IN

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.458
MY CAR WHILE ALSO TRYING TO STAY

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:02.392
ENROLLED IN COLLEGE FINDING

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.060
PERMANENT HOUSING AND WORKING

FULL TIME AT PETE'S COFFEE AND

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:06.897
TEA AND FARMERS INSURANCE.

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.398
BEING HOMELESS WAS EXTREMELY

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.133
STRESSFUL AND SCARY I WANTED TO

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.802
FIND A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD TO PARK

00:51:11.868 --> 00:51:13.537
MY CAR OVERNIGHT BUT THAT MEANT

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:15.605
HAVING TO CONSTANTLY MOVE MY CAR

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:16.173
TO AVOID BEING HARASSED BY

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:17.240
POLICE.

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:18.408
I WOULD SHOWER IN THE BATHROOM

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:20.076
AT WORK AND I DON'T TELL ANYONE

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:21.077
THAT I WAS HOMELESS BECAUSE OF

00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:23.947
THE NEGATIVE THE NEGATIVE STIGMA

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:24.581
AND THE CONCERN OF ME LOSING MY

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:25.415
JOB.

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:26.450
THROW ALL THIS I WAS ATTENDING

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:28.251

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.424
BUT WHEN I BECAME HOMELESS I

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:35.959
STARTED TO FEEL MY CLASSES.

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.794
MY TIME HOMELESS ENDED UP

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:39.229

THE FUNDING STRUCTURE OF LCF IS

DIVIDED INTO BASS SUPPLEMENTAL

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.633

MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE LONG

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.210
STRESSED THAT THE BASE FUNDING

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:49.512
LEVEL IN THE LCI PFAFF WAS SET

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.080
TO LOW FROM THE OUTSET AND I

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.215
AGREE.

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:53.449
STRONGLY WITH THAT.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.518
OPINION THIS PROPOSAL IS AN

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:56.552
ATTEMPT TO INCREASE THE BASE

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:58.554
FUNDING LEVEL FOR THIS FISCAL

01:00:58.621 --> 01:00:59.956
YEAR AND BECOME PART OF A

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.724
PERMANENT PART OF THE FUNDING

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:02.959
FORMULA MOVING FORWARD.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.127
THE FUNDING WILL HELP LOCAL

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.828
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH COST

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:08.031

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:10.033
AGENCIES THAT ARE FACING RISING

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:12.268
OPTIONAL COSTS -- AND ALSO FIXED

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:13.369
COSTS RETIREMENT COSTS

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.805
HEALTHCARE AND AS WE'VE HEARD

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.106
SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.775
FRANKLY I DON'T THINK ANYONE

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.777
ARGUED WITH THE IDEA OF TRYING

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.045
TO CREATE MORE OF A LOCAL

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:23.579
FUNDING FORMULA.

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:24.447
AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ARGUED

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.616
WITH CREATING A PROGRAM THAT

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:29.152
GAVE MORE FUNDS TO DISTRICTS

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:31.788
THAT HAD CERTAIN NEEDS WHERE THE

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.556
ARGUMENT CAME IS THE BASE

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.858
FUNDING WAS SET. TO LOW EVEN

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:38.561
TODAY WHEN WE CELEBRATE FULL

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:43.633
FUNDING OF LCF PFAFF.

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.168
WHEN YOU ADJUST FOR INFLATION OR

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:46.969
NOT AT TWO THOUSAND SEVENS

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.171
FUNDING LEVEL SO LET ME SAY THAT

01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:51.441
AGAIN WERE CLAIMING VICTORY WHEN-IT'S A HALF FACTORY YOU KNOW I'M

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.341
PROUD THAT WE'VE INCREASED

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:53.342
FUNDING?

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:56.813
BUT THE BASE WAS JUST SET TO LOW

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:59.015
AND DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.750
ARE FACING THAT CRUNCH IN

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.018
DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:03.653
AND IN DIFFERENT MANNERS BUT

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:06.089
MANY OF THEM IF NOT ALL OF THEM

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.257
NEED AN INCREASE FUNDING LEVEL

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:09.492
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.360
EDUCATION FUNDING WE TALK ABOUT

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:13.963
OUR KIDS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.731
ALWAYS STARTS WITH IT'S A

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:17.567
PRIORITY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:19.035
THAT THIS GENERATION HAS THE

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.137
TOOLS TO SUCCEED WE HAVE TO

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:22.405
FOCUS ON EDUCATION.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.140
BUT IT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.508
PRIORITIZING.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.243
WE DON'T OFTEN FOLLOW THROUGH ON

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.778
THAT SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO DO

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:30.279
A MINOR ADJUSTMENT THAT WOULD

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:33.583
HAVE A BIG IMPACT AND I

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.418

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.753
THE RESULT OF THE UNIFICATION OF

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:26.054
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.355
I WAS A PART OF THOSE EFFORTS IT

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:29.224
TOOK OVER TEN YEARS TO MAKE THAT

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.293
SCHOOL DISTRICT REALITY MANY

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:32.928
ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE WHEN YOU

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.663
ASK PEOPLE TO CONSIDER UNIFIED

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:35.764
SCHOOL DISTRICTS A VERY

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.399
EMOTIONAL ISSUE FOR A LOT OF

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:39.734
FOLKS AND THE REALITY IS THAT

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.136
YOU'RE WORKING TO PUT YOURSELF.

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:43.205
OUT OF A JOB AND IT'S DIFFICULT

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:45.073
TO GET TRUSTEES TO AGREE TO DO

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.575
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.076
SCHOOL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:49.411
TO AGREE TO DO THAT.

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:50.879
BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:53.281
BEST FOR KIDS UNIFICATION IS

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:54.683
BEST FOR KIDS AND EDUCATION

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.518
THEIR PROVIDES FOR OPPORTUNITIES

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:58.119
THAT YOU MAY NOT HAPPEN TO

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.287
DISTRICT THAT ISN'T UNIFIED.

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.889
IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:02.424
TEACHERS TO WORK TOGETHER SO

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:03.992
THAT THEY CAN HELP THOSE KIDS

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:04.826
MOVE FROM.

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.294
FROM THE VARIOUS GRADE LEVELS

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.363
AND FROM ELEMENTARY TO SECONDARY

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.432
EDUCATION SO FROM A STRICTLY

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:12.067
EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:14.536
AGAIN UNIFICATION IS INCREDIBLY

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:16.438
BENEFICIAL TO KIDS AND I THINK

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:17.539

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:20.742

LOOK AT THE GEOGRAPHY AND FINCH

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:16.758
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS.

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.594
DISPASSIONATELY WHAT MAKES SENSE

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.196

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:29.270
SCHOOL AND YOU SPIN OFF ONE OF

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:30.438
THE HIGH SCHOOL SO IT.

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:32.540
IT WORKS OFF AND IT IT'S IN THE

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:33.308
HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT OR MAYBE

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.944

HIGH SCHOOL.

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.815
OUT OF A UNIFIED HOUSE HIGH

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:43.151
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN AND JUST MAKE

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.519
A DISTRICT ON ITS OWN SO THERE'S

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:45.620
A THERE'S DIFFERENT.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.789
POSSIBILITIES BUT AGAIN WE'D

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.924
LIKE TO HAVE THEM WOULD LIKE TO

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:51.626
HAVE TO DISPATCH.

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:52.827
THIS PASSIONATE.

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:54.429
DRAWING A LINE SINCE SUGGESTION

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:57.465
AND THEN THE VIGOROUS IN -- A

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:59.401
HEALTHY DEBATE THAT GOES ON WITH

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:01.369
THAT AND I THINK IT IS NOT THAT

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:02.570
THAT THIS IS THE ONE LINE THAT

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:04.439
ENDS IT BUT BUT WE'D LIKE TO AT

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.474
LEAST HAVE THE MECHANISMS WHY WE

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:07.242
THINK IT.

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:08.410
IT WOULD ALLOW FOR BETTER

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.879
OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS AND WE

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:13.014
ALREADY HAVE A REQUIREMENT ON

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:13.948
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.316
THINGS LIKE THAT I MEAN I THINK

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:16.785
I CAN SEE A LOT OF THIS SAYING

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.253
WE'RE GOOD THIS IS A HEALTHY.

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:19.254
COMMUNITY.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.522
WE'RE GOING TO ADD THIS

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:22.891
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU

01:24:22.957 --> 01:24:24.392
GUYS HAVE A GOOD TAX BASE YOU DO

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.527
THIS IN AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:28.029
DEMAND THAT YOU BRING IT UP TO

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:28.596
PERFORMANCE WHICH IS I THINK

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:29.964
IT'S A GOOD [inaudible]

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:31.466
DISPASSIONATE [inaudible]

01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:34.402
RESOLUTION [inaudible]

GREAT OUT SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION.

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:40.608
I THINK WE I THINK WE NEED TO

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.076
LOOK AT THIS SO I HAVE THREE

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:43.845
GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN MY ONE

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.480
REGION WHERE I LIVE.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:46.581
WE HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:49.484
WHICH IS QUITE LARGE AND WE HAVE

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:51.052
FOUR VERY SMALL.

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.921
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:54.522
ISSUES IS JOB DUPLICATION OF

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:56.724
SERVICES -- SO THE HIGH SCHOOL

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.993
DISTRICT DID A STUDY LIKE TWELVE

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.161
YEARS AGO MISSION THERE WERE

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:02.397
SAVE AT LEAST FOURTEEN MILLION A

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.999
YEAR -- BUT PEOPLE VIEWED IT AS

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:06.568
A AS A POWER GRAB SO I WAS

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.136
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND WE

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.504
MOVE FORWARD ON THIS I'M GONNA

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:11.005
BRING YOU DOWN TO ME AND MY

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:12.240

THERE'S THERE'S A SLOW UP A SLUG

01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:20.915
OF A REPORTS IN A ONE NUMBER

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:22.217
BEING BANTER AROUND THIS IS

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:24.452
UNITED STATES.

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:25.386
TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:27.222
THAT WOULD BE SAFE ON CHOOSE THE

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:28.890
ADMINISTRATIVE STUFF THAT COULD

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.658
GO TO THE CLASSROOMS AND I THINK

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.627
THAT'S MY PITCH AND I REMEMBER

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:33.428

YOUR QUESTION YOU MEET YOU MADE

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:36.064
THAT EFFORT -- WITH WATER

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:19.726
HAS YET TO BE ACHIEVED?

01:48:19.793 --> 01:48:20.861
IN FACT DUE TO THE COMMUNITY

I ALREADY EXPLAINED WHAT THE 75%

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:52.459
GOAL IS A THE 50% LAW BASICALLY

01:48:52.525 --> 01:48:54.261
STATES THAT 50% OF COLLEGE

01:48:54.327 --> 01:48:57.497
FUNDING IS SPENT ON INSTRUCTION.

01:48:57.564 --> 01:48:59.165
THE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:00.267
CONCERT IN MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:49:00.333 --> 01:49:00.867
THE WORKGROUP REPORTED

RECOMMENDATIONS TO ACHIEVE THE

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:05.038
75% FULL TIME FACULTY GOAL.

01:49:05.105 --> 01:49:06.740
THE WORKER ALSO HOPE TO COME UP

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:08.808
WITH A RECOMMENDATION TO THE 50%

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:10.810
LAW -- BUT NO FORTY THEY'RE NOT

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:12.245
THERE YET BECAUSE IT DOES NOT

COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO

01:49:16.783 --> 01:49:17.717
REFORMS.

01:49:17.784 --> 01:49:23.156

YOU WOULD PREFER THE FULL

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:28.395
PACKAGE BUT ANY REFORM PROPOSALS

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:29.896
FOR THIS ANY 5% GOAL.

01:49:29.963 --> 01:49:30.830
AT THIS IS CALLED THE FUN

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:32.966
FACULTY OBLIGATION NUMBER AND

01:49:33.033 --> 01:49:34.701
THE 50% LAW INCLUDED IN THIS

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:36.703
BILL -- BUT THIS BILL IS MEANT

01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:38.071
TO INCORPORATE ONLY THOSE

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:39.539
REFORMS AGREED UPON BY THE WORK

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:41.441
GROUP ALREADY NOTHING MORE AND

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:42.842
NOTHING LESS.

01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:43.910
OF THE WORKER DOES COME UP WITH

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:45.879
RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD BE HAPPY

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:47.180
TO AMEND THE BILL TO INCORPORATE

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:48.615
THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:50.183
AS WELL I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.851
ADDRESS A COUPLE OF CONCERNS

01:49:51.918 --> 01:49:53.853
RAISED ABOUT THE BILL. ONE IS A

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.956
CONCERN THAT THIS BILL WHICH

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:56.856
SHOULD.

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:57.958
ONLY BE ADOPTED UNLESS IT COMES

01:49:58.024 --> 01:49:59.526
WITH MORE FUNDING BECAUSE FULL

01:49:59.592 --> 01:50:01.461
TIME FACULTY COSTS MORE I WOULD

01:50:01.528 --> 01:50:02.896
POINT OUT THAT THE INCREASES IN

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:05.231
COST IS NOT. FOR FULL COST OF

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:07.033
FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBER BUT THE

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:08.535
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PART TIME

01:50:08.601 --> 01:50:10.370
FACULTY MEMBER ALREADY EMPLOYED

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:11.905
AND A FULL TIME.

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:13.440
EMPLOYEE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

01:50:13.506 --> 01:50:15.842
ALREADY PAYING PART TIME FACULTY

01:50:15.909 --> 01:50:17.143
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE

01:50:17.210 --> 01:50:18.445
STATE NOT ONLY GAVE MORE

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:19.846
FLEXIBILITY TO COMMUNITY

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:20.714
COLLEGES.

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:22.048
AND THEIR USE OF FUNDS BUT IT

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:24.484
ALSO INCREASE THE FUNDING NO

01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:25.952
DOUBT I WILL BE AN ARDENT

01:50:26.019 --> 01:50:27.520
SUPPORTER MOVING FORWARD FOR

01:50:27.587 --> 01:50:28.621
FIGHTING FOR MORE FUNDING FOR

01:50:28.688 --> 01:50:30.256
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:32.092
BUT AT THIS POINT COLLEGES ARE

01:50:32.158 --> 01:50:33.626
WAY BETTER OFF THAN THEY WERE A

01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:37.263
FEW YEARS AGO SO IF NOT NOW WHEN

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:38.999
AND AGAIN THIRTY YEARS.

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:40.467
ANOTHER CONCERN I HEARD IS THIS

01:50:40.533 --> 01:50:42.502
BILL IS PREMATURE BECAUSE THE

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:43.837
CHANCELLOR.

01:50:43.903 --> 01:50:45.605
THE CHANCES CONSULTATION COUNCIL

01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:46.673
HAS YET TO MEET AND REVIEW THE

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:49.042
WORK GROUPS OF RECOMMENDATIONS

01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:50.877
MEMBERS THIS RECOMMENDATIONS

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:52.879
WERE PROPOSED OVER A YEAR AGO

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:54.347
THE COUNCIL MEETS FREQUENTLY.

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:55.815
AND I IMAGINE IT WOULD HAVE HAD

01:50:55.882 --> 01:50:57.317
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THIS AND

01:50:57.384 --> 01:50:59.652
HOW TIME. TO TO DISCUSS SOUL TO

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.021
ASK FOR THE BILL TO WAIT FOR THE

01:51:01.087 --> 01:51:02.022
COUNCIL AND THEN THE BOARD OF

01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:03.556
GOVERNORS TO MEET IS TO

01:51:03.623 --> 01:51:04.891
ESSENTIALLY ASKED FOR THE BILL

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:06.026
TO DYING COMMITTEE.

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.327
IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT DOING

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:08.728
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:10.397
ISSUE I ASKED THAT WE MOVE THE

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:12.198
BILL TODAY THE BILL IS NOT

01:51:12.265 --> 01:51:13.700
NEEDED IN THE END THAT'S OKAY

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:15.835
BUT AT LEAST WE ENSURE WE DO NOT

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:17.837
TO LATE YET ANOTHER YEAR.

01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:19.606
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WAS FIRST.

01:51:19.672 --> 01:51:21.041
MY FIRST ACCESS TO A TO A HIGHER

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:23.376
EDUCATION AS A FORMER COMMUNITY

01:51:23.443 --> 01:51:24.677
COLLEGE STUDENT I UNDERSTAND HOW

01:51:24.744 --> 01:51:26.646
IMPORTANT FULL TIME FACULTY ARE

01:51:26.713 --> 01:51:28.281
AND HOW MUCH WE NEED THEM IF THE

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:29.816
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE GOING TO

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:31.384
IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES.

01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:33.753
AT OVER 43% OF LATINOS COMPRISE

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.055
THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF STUDENT

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:36.423
ENROLLMENT AND CALIFORNIA

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:38.324
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE NEXT

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:40.994
LARGEST GROUP IS WHITE AT 26% IN

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:42.295
GENERAL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:43.696
SYSTEM IS THE LARGEST.

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:46.032
MOST IMPORTANT POP PIPELINE TO

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:47.400
HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STATE.

01:51:47.467 --> 01:51:50.070
LATINO POPULATION ACCORDING TO

01:51:50.136 --> 01:51:51.337
TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT BY THE PEW

01:51:51.404 --> 01:51:52.705
RESEARCH CENTER LATINOS HAVE

01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:54.274
MADE INROADS IN INCREASING THE

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:57.544
NUMBER OF COLLEGE ENROLLMENT BUT

01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:59.045
TRY STICKY LACK BEHIND AND

01:51:59.112 --> 01:51:59.479
COLLEGE COMPLETION.

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:00.814
DATA FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN SHOW

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.817
THAT ONLY 15% OF LATINOS AGE

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:04.451
TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY NINE YEARS

01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:06.119

MORE COMPARED 263% OF ASIANS 41%

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:12.192
WHITES AND 22% BLACKS.

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:13.059
THIS TREND IS EXTREMELY

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:14.861
TROUBLING GIVEN THAT LATINOS ARE

01:52:14.928 --> 01:52:15.995
NOW THE LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP IN

01:52:16.062 --> 01:52:17.263
CALIFORNIA.

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:18.865
THE SIMPLE FACT THE FULL TIME

01:52:18.932 --> 01:52:20.733
FACULTY CAN HOLD OFFICE HOURS

AGO WE ASK FOR DATA FROM THE

CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE ONCE

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:15.014
WE FOLD IN FOR INSTANCE THE

01:54:15.081 --> 01:54:16.282

FOLDING IN CANCERS AND

01:54:20.453 --> 01:54:21.554
PERCENTAGE.

01:54:21.621 --> 01:54:22.855

WE STATE 50% THAT WE'RE GONNA BE.

01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:27.260
KNOCKING PEOPLE OUT SO IT'S

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:58.224
ISSUES.

01:54:58.291 --> 01:54:59.726
I HAVE NEVER AGREED ON THIS

01:54:59.792 --> 01:55:01.561
LEASES ALL THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN

01:55:01.628 --> 01:55:03.396

I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT

01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:09.569
THAT'S THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

01:55:09.636 --> 01:55:10.837
WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY IT MOVE

01:55:10.903 --> 01:55:12.639
ALONG WITH FULL TIME FACT WHICH

01:55:12.705 --> 01:55:14.040
IS GOING BACKWARDS BY THE WAY.

01:55:14.107 --> 01:55:15.808
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE LOST

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:17.343
CLOSE TO THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS

01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:18.911
OUT WEIRD 56% NOW WE SHOULD BE

01:55:18.978 --> 01:55:21.014

TEN YEARS AGO -- AND WE DIDN'T

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:24.651
WANT THIS TO SIT ON A SHELF --

01:55:24.717 --> 01:55:26.286
AGAIN IT'S BEEN IN THE FIELD FOR

01:55:26.352 --> 01:55:27.787
THREE YEARS THERE'S BEEN PLENTY

01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:30.189
OF TIME FOR THE CANCERS OFFICE --

01:55:30.256 --> 01:55:31.724

IS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON SO --

01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.372

01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:48.441
JUNE TWO THOUSAND FIVE YOU ARE

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:49.709

01:55:56.482 --> 01:55:57.784
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

01:55:57.850 --> 01:55:59.018
I CAN PICK UP FROM RIGHT THERE

01:55:59.085 --> 01:56:00.520
BECAUSE I SERVED ON THAT TASK

01:56:00.586 --> 01:56:02.989
FORCE AS WELL IN TWO THOUSAND

01:56:03.056 --> 01:56:03.823
FIVE AND THEN I WAS INVOLVED IN

01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:05.158
ALL OF THE WORK GROUP --

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:08.294
SESSIONS -- IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:09.829
ACTUALLY WE WERE AT THAT POINT

01:56:09.896 --> 01:56:11.464
COMING OFF ABOUT A TEN YEAR

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:12.899
PERIOD WHERE OUR PERCENTAGE.

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:15.568
HOVERED AROUND 63% ACTUALLY SO

01:56:15.635 --> 01:56:16.936
WE'VE ACTED AND WHEN WE ENTERED

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:19.672
INTO A RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND

01:56:19.739 --> 01:56:20.573
SEVEN TWO YEARS LATER.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.541
THAT'S WHEN THOSE NUMBERS THAT

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:23.209
DAVID LISTED THAT BECAME

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:26.379
OPERATIVE WE DROP DOWN BELOW

01:56:26.446 --> 01:56:28.081
SIXTY AND NOW WE'RE DOWN AROUND --

01:56:28.147 --> 01:56:28.681
FIFTY SEVEN I THINK IT'S THE

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.183
DYNAMICS OF THE CUTS AND THINGS

01:56:30.249 --> 01:56:31.584
THAT HAPPENED DURING THOSE THOSE

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:32.785
YEARS BUT IT'S HARD TO

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:34.487
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT -- WOULD BE

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:37.056
THE CASE -- ONE THING I WOULD

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:39.258
JUST LIKE TO ADD TO THIS IS THAT

01:56:39.325 --> 01:56:41.594
THIS WHOLE WORKGROUP CAME OUT OF

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:43.129
WHAT WAS CALLED.

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:46.099
THE SACRED COWS WORKSHOPS.

01:56:46.165 --> 01:56:47.467
THEY WERE PRESENTED BY AND THEN

01:56:47.533 --> 01:56:50.370
THE SACRED COWS ARE THE 50% LAW

01:56:50.436 --> 01:56:53.072
AND THE 75% GOAL -- THE IT WAS A

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:56.676
GROUP OF ONE ACADEMIC SENATE --

01:56:56.743 --> 01:56:58.978
PERSON THE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME --

01:56:59.045 --> 01:57:00.546
BUSINESS OFFICER AND THE CHIEF

01:57:00.613 --> 01:57:02.014
EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM THE

01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:03.816
SYSTEM AND THEY HAD OPEN

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:05.485
MEETINGS WHERE THEY DISCUSSED

01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:07.053
THESE -- PROBLEMS.

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.154
I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A MATTER OF

01:57:08.221 --> 01:57:09.856
AGREEMENT OR NOT BUT WE'VE NEVER

01:57:09.922 --> 01:57:11.090
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:13.626
THE 75% GOAL AND WE ALSO HAVE

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:14.927
THE 50% LAW.

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:17.797
THAT -- SETS A REQUIREMENT FOR

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:18.431
THE DISTRICTS IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:57:18.498 --> 01:57:19.332
SPENDING.

01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:21.801
AND CENTER LATE -- SENATOR RUBIO

01:57:23.236 --> 01:57:24.837
CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION.

01:57:24.904 --> 01:57:25.938
BUT AS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN

01:57:26.005 --> 01:57:27.907
REFORMED MIGHTILY WE'VE GOT NEW

01:57:27.974 --> 01:57:30.977
MONEY TO ACTUALLY FIND LEASE --

01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:32.378
FUND OUR STUDENTS SERVICES

01:57:32.445 --> 01:57:34.747
SUPPORT OF FOR STUDENT SUCCESS

01:57:34.814 --> 01:57:37.817
THAT'S A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH -- WE

01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:40.019
WERE ALWAYS PAID SIMPLY FOR

01:57:40.086 --> 01:57:41.921
STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS LIKE A

01:57:41.988 --> 01:57:45.691
TWELVE IS EIGHTY A FOR US FOR US

01:57:45.758 --> 01:57:46.526
IT WAS ALSO ATTENDANCE.

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:47.126
NOW WE'RE FINALLY OVER THAT

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:48.461
HURDLE THIS IS THE TIME TO COME

01:57:48.528 --> 01:57:50.763
TOGETHER THIS IS A ONCE IN A

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:53.332
LIFETIME POTENTIAL TO HAVE THESE

01:57:53.399 --> 01:57:55.435
TWO ISSUES ADDRESSED -- BRING

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:56.936
THE STUDENTS SERVICE SIDE INTO

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:58.871
TE 50% LAW TO SOME LIMITED

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:00.306
EXTENT.

01:58:00.373 --> 01:58:01.941
WE NEED THE DATA ON NOT TO BE

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:03.676
ABLE TO SET THAT NEW NUMBER.

01:58:03.743 --> 01:58:05.478
AND THEN ALSO TO INSTITUTE A

01:58:05.545 --> 01:58:07.280
MEANS OF GETTING THE FULL TIME

01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:08.915
FACULTY WE NEED.

01:58:08.981 --> 01:58:09.682
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

01:58:09.749 --> 01:58:12.318
INSTRUCTIONS ALL THE OTHER WORK

01:58:12.385 --> 01:58:13.653
THAT GOES INTO STUDENT SUCCESS.

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:16.722
GUIDED PATHWAYS REQUIRES A LOT

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:18.491
MORE FACULTY MENTORING.

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:20.159
THAT'S HOW WE NEED FULL TIME

01:58:20.226 --> 01:58:22.528
FACULTY TO DO THAT WORK SO THE

01:58:22.595 --> 01:58:25.131
THE IT'S A NEXUS PERFECT TIME WE

01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:26.766

THAT WILL BE BENEFIT TO ALL OUR

01:58:28.201 --> 01:58:29.302

PRISONER RE ENTRY AND

02:07:12.725 --> 02:07:14.493
REINTEGRATION IN FEBRUARY I

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.894

I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY FROM A

02:07:19.198 --> 02:07:20.632
REINTEGRATION PERSPECTIVE.

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:22.368
THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU IS WHO

02:07:22.434 --> 02:07:23.902
WE WANT COMING HOME FROM PRISON

02:07:23.969 --> 02:07:25.304
AND WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO WHEN

02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:27.306
THEY COME HOME.

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:28.974
A WIDELY STATED A WIDELY CITED

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:30.309
STUDY BY THE RAND CORPORATION

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:31.310
FOUND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:32.745
PARTICIPATING COLLEGE EDUCATION

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:34.413
PROGRAMS WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.782
OR 48% LESS LIKELY TO RECIDIVIST

02:07:36.849 --> 02:07:38.183
HAVE TO THEIR RELEASE.

02:07:38.250 --> 02:07:39.251
I ALSO BELIEVE THE TAKING

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:40.853
COLLEGE COURSES IN PRISON WILL

02:07:40.919 --> 02:07:42.621
IMPROVE REINTEGRATION EVEN FOR

02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:43.155
THOSE WHO DON'T FINISH THE

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:44.390
DEGREE.

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:45.591
MANY WILL SEEK TO CONTINUE THEIR

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:47.226
EDUCATION AFTER RELEASE AND

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:48.761
COLLEGES ARE INSTITUTIONS WHOSE

02:07:48.827 --> 02:07:50.062
MISSION IS TO HELP PEOPLE TO

02:07:50.129 --> 02:07:51.597
IMPROVE THEMSELVES.

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:52.965
BY ALLOWING PEOPLE IN PRISONS

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:56.201

02:07:56.268 --> 02:07:56.735
FIVE SEVENTY FIVE HAS THE

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:58.070
POTENTIAL TO DRAMATICALLY

02:07:58.137 --> 02:07:58.670
INCREASE COLLEGE ENROLLMENT IN

02:07:58.737 --> 02:07:59.972
PRISON.

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:01.907
THEIR TWO REASONS FOR THIS FIRST

02:08:01.974 --> 02:08:03.275
EVEN FOR THOSE WORK CURRENTLY

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:04.576
HAVE ACCESS TO COLLEGE COURSES

02:08:04.643 --> 02:08:06.612
THE EXPENSES OF BOOKS AND OTHER

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:07.079
STUDY MATERIALS CAN BE

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:08.313
PROHIBITIVE.

02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:09.415
THOSE SERVING TIME IN PRISON

02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:11.150
TYPICALLY HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR

02:08:11.216 --> 02:08:13.152
FAMILIES TO COVER THOSE COSTS.

02:08:13.218 --> 02:08:15.721
SECOND SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE WILL

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:16.221
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

02:08:16.288 --> 02:08:18.257
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:19.792
AFFORD TO PAY TUITION.

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:20.659
THIS IN TURN WILL MAKE IT MORE

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:22.294
COST EFFECTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO

02:08:22.361 --> 02:08:23.929
PROVIDE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:08:23.996 --> 02:08:25.264
PRISONS.

02:08:25.330 --> 02:08:26.632
AND PROGRAMS RUN BY A CREDIT

02:08:26.698 --> 02:08:28.367
CALIFORNIA COLLEGES WILL PROVIDE

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:29.334
COURSE CRITIC ME PUT TWENTY

02:08:29.401 --> 02:08:31.537
DEGREE EVEN AFTER RELEASE.

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:32.638
THAT WILL ENCOURAGE AND ENABLE

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:34.173
FORMALLY INCARCERATED

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:36.508
INDIVIDUALS TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE.

02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:37.109
ONE OF PEOPLE SERVING TIME IN

02:08:37.176 --> 02:08:38.510
PRISON.

02:08:38.577 --> 02:08:40.212
WILL NOT PEOPLE SERVING TIME IN

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:41.246
PRISON TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CAL

02:08:41.313 --> 02:08:42.448
GRANTS TO MAKE THE PROGRAM

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:44.216
WORTHWHILE I THINK WE'LL SEE THE

02:08:44.283 --> 02:08:45.584
ANSWER IS YES.

02:08:45.651 --> 02:08:46.752
IN OUR RESEARCH WITH FORMALLY

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:49.688
FOUND IT ALMOST ALL WERE EAGLES

DISAPPOINTED WITH FEW OPTIONS

02:08:54.359 --> 02:08:55.894
WHILE THEY WERE IN PRISON.

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:56.762
FURTHERMORE ACCORDING TO

02:08:56.829 --> 02:08:57.830
CORRECTIONS TO COLLEGE THERE

PLACE.

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:14.413
WHAT WILL IT COST TO EXPAND

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:15.681
ACCESS TO CUT GRANTS?

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:17.216
FAR LESS THAN WHAT WE'RE LIKELY

02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:19.251
TO SAVE FROM LESS IMPRISONMENT

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:20.786
AND LAST RECIDIVISM.

02:09:20.853 --> 02:09:22.254
COST OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND

02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:22.821

02:29:01.966 --> 02:29:03.301
SIGNIFICANT WAIT TIMES TO SEE A

02:29:03.367 --> 02:29:04.969
COUNSELOR SOMETIMES UP TO A

02:29:05.036 --> 02:29:05.870

02:29:05.936 --> 02:29:07.338

02:29:07.405 --> 02:29:08.839
CAN SEE A COUNSELOR IN A YEAR

02:29:08.906 --> 02:29:11.676
SOMETIMES AS LOW AS FIVE TIMES.

02:29:11.742 --> 02:29:13.110
THAT IS WHY PASSING IN FUNDING

02:29:13.177 --> 02:29:15.880
SB SIX SIXTY IS SO CRUCIAL WHEN

02:29:15.946 --> 02:29:17.581
A STUDENT CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR

02:29:17.648 --> 02:29:18.949
NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

02:29:19.016 --> 02:29:20.384
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT

02:29:20.451 --> 02:29:21.819
NEARLY A MONTH TO SEE SOMEONE.

02:29:21.886 --> 02:29:23.120
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:29:23.187 --> 02:29:24.722
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN PRESENT

02:29:24.789 --> 02:29:27.725
REAL AND IMMEDIATE SAFETY ISSUES

02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:28.326
FOR STUDENTS AND THE STUDENTS

02:29:28.392 --> 02:29:29.293

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:31.462
ADDITIONALLY ON ALL CAMPUSES

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:32.863

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:34.165
PAY FOR THESE MENTAL HEALTH

02:29:34.231 --> 02:29:35.533
RESOURCES CURRENTLY.

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:37.001
THIS MEANS THAT THE MOST OBVIOUS

02:29:37.068 --> 02:29:39.103
WAY TO EXPAND THESE RESOURCES

02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:42.039
WOULD BE -- NOT.

02:29:42.106 --> 02:29:43.574
TOO FAT TO INCREASE THOSE

02:29:43.641 --> 02:29:47.545
STUDENT FEES BUT THROUGH SB SIX

02:29:47.611 --> 02:29:49.013
SIXTY INCREASING -- REALLY

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:50.748
ELIMINATES THAT PROBLEM ALL

02:29:50.815 --> 02:29:53.284
TOGETHER AND IT IS WHY AGAIN THE

02:29:53.351 --> 02:29:55.286
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE SB

02:29:55.353 --> 02:29:57.722

WITH THAT AMBIGUITY IN CASE LAW.

02:31:58.309 --> 02:32:00.845
AS IT RELATES TO DESIGN BUILD

02:32:00.911 --> 02:32:03.380

02:32:03.447 --> 02:32:05.950

WHEN THE SCHOOL THIS AWARD THE

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:16.660

AWARDED THE CONTRACT IN FACT

02:32:23.834 --> 02:32:25.169
DOES NOT MEAN APPROVAL.

02:32:25.236 --> 02:32:26.837
AND SO THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY

02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:28.939
CLARIFIES THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:32:29.006 --> 02:32:30.474

TERMINATE THE CONTRACT MODIFIED.

02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:34.245
