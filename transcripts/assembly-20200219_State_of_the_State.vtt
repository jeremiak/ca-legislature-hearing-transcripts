THERE'S NOTHING JUST AS WELL

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:55.841
ABOUT SIDEWALKS AND STREET

00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:57.509
CORNERS THAT AREN'T SAFE AND

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:59.678
CLEAN FOR EVERYBODY. THE

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:00.445
PROBLEM IS PERSISTED FOR

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:03.014
DECADES BECAUSE BY MASSIVE

00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:04.316
FAILURES IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.785

TOO LONG WE'VE IGNORE THIS

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.997
PROBLEM. WE TURNED AWAY WHEN IT

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:20.832

OFTEN WASN'T THERE. BUT MOST OF

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:29.708
US EXPERIENCE ALMOST THIS IS A

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:31.476
PANG OF GUILT. NOT A CALL TO

POINT IN TIME CáC THAT'S

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.098
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND MORE. THAN

00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:55.700
WE HAVE TODAY. AND EVEN AT THAT

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.836
PEAK THE STATE DID NOT TREAT

00:23:57.903 --> 00:23:59.604
THE ISSUE WITH THE URGENCY

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:01.506

THE HARDEST PART OF THIS

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:12.036
PROBLEM. THAT'S THE CHRONICALLY

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:14.005
HOMELESS. THE FOLKS OUT IN THE

00:31:14.072 --> 00:31:16.140
STREETS AND SIDEWALKS FOR OVER

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:18.476
A YEAR. WITH COMPLEX BEHAVIOR

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:21.045
HEALTH ISSUES. FOR CENTURIES

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:23.281
THE DEFAULT TREATMENT WAS

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:26.184
CONFINEMENT IN A SILENCE WHERE

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:27.218
PEOPLE DETERIORATED OUT OF

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:29.587
SIGHT. IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:31.222
AND IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES ARE

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:33.224
OUR NATION BEGAN THE TREND

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.593
TOWARDS DE INSTITUTIONALIZATION

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.162
WAS NOT A SINGLE POLICY. IT WAS

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:40.698
A SERIES OF POLICIES. OUTRAGE

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:42.700
OVER CONDITIONS IN INSTITUTIONS

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.369
AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF NEW

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.371
MEDICATIONS LIKE FOR ISN'T THAT

00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:48.273
THE- HELP TREAT THE MENTALLY

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:50.541
ILL AND IT SPARKED A MOVEMENT

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:52.010
TO. TREAT PEOPLE IN THEIR

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.378
COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN LOCKING

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:57.215
THEM AWAY. CALIFORNIA PASSED

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:59.917
THE SHORT ACT IN FIFTY SEVEN TO

00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:01.552
FUND COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.354

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:11.062
ENVISION A SYSTEM IN WHICH IN

00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:13.431
HIS WORDS THE RELIANCE ON THE

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:15.300
COLD MERCY OF CUSTODIAL

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:18.069
ISOLATION WILL SUBLIMATE WOULD

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:19.771

STATE MENTAL HOSPITALS WERE

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:29.414
CLOSED BUT THE PROMISE OF

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.815
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH IS

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.051
NEVER FULLY REALIZED. STATES

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:33.951
WOULD BURDEN NOW THE

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:35.887
RESPONSIBILITY BUT PROVIDED

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:37.955
LITTLE IN THE WAY OF SUPPORT

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:39.290
LAWS WERE CHANGED TO MAKE IT

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:41.292
HARDER TO COMPEL MENTAL HEALTH

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.127
TREATMENT AS WELL. THEN

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:44.228
GOVERNOR RONALD REAGAN SIGNED

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.563
THE LETTERMAN PETRA SHORT

INAPPROPRIATE LIFETIME

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:50.902

DONALD RULED THAT MENTAL

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:04.315
ILLNESS ALONE COULD NOT JUSTIFY

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:06.784
A STATE BLOCKING A PERSON UP

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:08.720

00:33:08.786 --> 00:33:10.655

AN SR ROSE WHICH FOR SO MANY

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:24.369
WAS THE ONLY HOUSING OPTION

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:26.437
THEY CAN AFFORD. THE CUBAN OF

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:29.073

INSTITUTIONS. PATIENTS AND

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:34.779
THEIR FAMILIES WERE LEFT WITH

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.914
IN ADEQUATE OPTIONS TO GET THE

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:39.350
MENTAL HEALTH CARE THEY NEED.

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.351
IN A POLITICALLY POLARIZED

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:42.520
WORLD. LIBERALS AND

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:44.789

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:46.657
FOR THESE FAILURES.

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:49.127
HISTORICALLY SPEAKING BOTH ARE

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:51.429
RIGHT IT'S TIME TO STOP

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:54.332
POINTING FINGERS AND JOIN HANDS

00:33:54.399 --> 00:34:12.350
IN A TRANSFORMATIONAL SOLUTION.

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:17.488
LET'S NOT. LET'S TALK ABOUT.

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:18.556
THIS YEAR WE HAVE PROPOSED

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:20.091
CALLING IT'S A ONCE IN A

00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.626
LIFETIME REFORM OF OUR MEDICAL

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:23.394
SYSTEM BASED ON THE OBVIOUS

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:25.663
LONG IGNORED PRINCIPLE THAT

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.764
PHYSICAL HEALTH AND BRAIN

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:30.468
HEALTH ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:35.606
AFTER ALL. AFTER. TEN MILLION

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:37.275
CALIFORNIANS TEN MILLION

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:40.311
CALIFORNIA'S ONE IN FOUR SUFFER

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:41.579
FROM SOME TYPE OF BEHAVIORAL

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:43.314
HEALTH CONDITION. THIS IS NOT A

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:46.484
NARROW ISSUE. NOR A NEW ONE.

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:47.718
THE DEEPER TRUTH IS THAT OUR

00:34:47.785 --> 00:34:48.920
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THOUGH IT'S

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.688
BEEN DECIDED TREAT SOME OF OUR

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:54.659
PARTS NOT THE SUM OF OUR PARTS

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:57.161
IN THAT MUST CHANGE. SLAM

00:34:57.228 --> 00:35:01.499
PROPOSAL. THIS LANDMARK

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:03.301
PROPOSAL CALLS FOR LEVERAGING

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:06.270
MEDI CAL AS A TOOL TO HELP

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:07.338
CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.273
RESIDENTS THE HOMELESS OUR

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.509
CHILDREN AND PEOPLE CYCLING IN

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:13.211
AND OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:15.112
SYSTEM IT'S ABOUT INTEGRATING

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:16.981
CARE TARGETING SOCIAL

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.382
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:21.018
EXPANDING OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:35.600
PILOTS. STATEWIDE. HEALTHCARE.

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.068
HEALTHCARE AND HOUSING CAN NO

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:38.903
LONGER BE DIVORCED AFTER ALL

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.238
WHAT'S MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO A

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:42.139
PERSON'S WELL BEING THEN A ROOF

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.542
OVER THEIR HEAD. DOCTORS

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:46.410
DOCTORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:48.679
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HOUSING THE

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:51.082
SAME WAY THEY DO FOR INSULIN

00:35:51.148 --> 00:36:04.629
AND ANTIBIOTICS. ONE THAT'S NOW

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.898
THAT'S THE AIM OF CALLING

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:08.132
TRANSFORMING OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:09.834
AS WE KNOW IT AND WE BACKED IT

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:12.503
UP WITH THE SIX HUNDRED AND

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.371
NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.740

THIS YEAR. NOW. COURSE ALL OF

THIS YOU KNOW. ALL THIS ALLIES

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.518
IN HINGES ON AN INDIVIDUAL

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:30.655
BEING CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING HELP

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.823
TO GET OFF THE STREETS AND INTO

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.659
TREATMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:35.726
SOME AS WE KNOW TRAGICALLY OR

00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:37.695
NOT THAT'S WHY WE NEED BETTER

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:40.298
LEGAL TOLLS ONES THAT ALLOW

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.866
LOCAL GOVERNMENT HELP PROVIDERS

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:46.103
EFFECTIVELY HELP PEOPLE ACCESS

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.572
TREATMENT THEY NEED.

00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:49.006
CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:49.907
THIS MAY HAVE BEEN AHEAD OF

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:52.343
THEIR TIME. BUT TODAY THEY CALL

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.912
OPERATE FOR. WE MUST TAYLOR

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.347
THESE POLICIES TO REFLECT THE

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:57.348
REALITIES OF STREET

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.216
HOMELESSNESS TO DATE WHICH IS

00:36:59.283 --> 00:37:01.452
SO DIFFERENT IT WAS FIFTY YEARS

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:04.255
AGO OR EVEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.490
WHEN THESE LAWS WERE ENACTED.

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.125
AND WHILE WE MADE PROGRESS

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:09.493
UNLIMITED AND GENERAL

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.362
CONSERVATORSHIP LAST YEAR

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:12.997
FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS FROM MY

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:20.771
PERSPECTIVE ARE WARRANTED. ALL

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:21.572
WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF DEEP

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:23.741
RESPECT ALWAYS FOR CIVIL

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.176
LIBERTIES AND PERSONAL FREEDOMS

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:27.011
BUT WITH AN EQUAL EMPHASIS ON

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.679
HELPING PEOPLE IN THE

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:31.382
LIFESAVING TREATMENT THEY NEED

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:35.252
AT THE PRECISE MOMENT. THEY

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:37.688
NEED IT. WELL CLEARLY IT IS

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:39.457
TIME TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS

00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:41.025
EXPERTS WHO AGREE THAT

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.393
THRESHOLD FOR CONSERVATORSHIP

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.562
ARE TOO HIGH AND NEED TO BE

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.897
REVISITED. TAKE LAURA'S LAW

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:48.232
WHICH ALLOWS LOVE ONCE AND

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:50.334
SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ASK COURTS

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:51.836
TO COMPEL THOSE WHO NEED

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:53.838
TREATMENT IN A COMMUNITY BASED

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:56.273
OUTPATIENT CARE THE PROBLEM IS

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.676
IT'S TOO HARD TO USE. WE NEED

00:37:58.743 --> 00:37:59.810
TO REMOVE SOME OF THE

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:01.479
CONDITIONS IMPOSED ON THE

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:03.080
COUNTIES TRYING TO IMPLEMENT A

00:38:03.147 --> 00:38:04.515
LOT SO THEY CAN EXPAND WHO

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:11.789
BENEFITS. IT WOULD HOUSING

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:13.290
CONSERVATORSHIP WE NEED

AUTHORIZED COUNTIES THROUGHOUT

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:19.030
PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONE THAT WAS

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.064
RECENTLY DEVELOPED IN SAN

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:23.934

NAIVE ABOUT THIS THAT SAID. WE

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:28.339
KNOW THAT THE MOST URGENT ISSUE

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:31.008
IS NO THE LEGAL INABILITY TO

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.843
CONSERVE PEOPLE BUT THE ON

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.646
AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING AND

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:40.918
CARE FOR THOSE WHO MOST NEED. I

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.787
RECOGNIZE POLICIES AN EMPTY

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:44.622
PROMISE WITHOUT CREATING MORE

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.957
PLACEMENTS. AND ONE CLEAR

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:49.226
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS. IS BY

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:52.363
REFORMING PROPOSITION SIXTY

PEOPLE NEED IT THE MOST. NOT

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.947
WHEN UP OPPOSING CHANGING THE

EACH COUNTY GETS RATHER REFORM

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.720

HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.900
DOLLARS TO GET THIS ONE UP AND

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.769
RUNNING BASED ON THE SEVERITY

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:01.739
OF CRISIS WE NEED EARLY

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:03.407
LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO SET UP

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.542

ORDER TO REVERSE DECADES OF

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:23.360
NEGLECT. IN ORDER TO TURN

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:25.295
THINGS AROUND THOUGH. THE

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:27.631
CRISIS THIS DEEP ROOTED ALSO

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.266
GONNA NEED MORE THAN JUST ONE

SIGNIFICANT SUSTAINABLE REVENUE.

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:43.347
I KNOW THIS IS ALWAYS THE

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.349
TOUGHEST THING SO IN THE NEXT

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:46.950
FEW MONTHS LOOK I'M WORKING I

ONGOING REVENUE WILL COME FROM

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.025
BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT. TO

DESERVE IT'S TIME TO MUSTER THE

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:04.001
POLITICAL WILL TO MEET THIS

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:06.370

PERMANENT SOLUTIONS ANYTHING

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:12.609
LESS IS NOT GOING TO GET THE

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:15.746
JOB DONE. IN ORDER TO- GET THE

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:17.014

CRISIS HAD ON REQUIRE.

00:45:31.028 --> 00:45:33.697
REQUIRING WATER AND THAT ANY

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.899
NEW FUNDING ISN'T REPLACING

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:38.368
EXISTING SPENDING BUT CREATING

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:41.105
NEW SOLUTIONS. SOME HAVE

00:45:41.171 --> 00:45:42.372
RECOMMENDED A LEGAL RIGHT TO

SHOP. I KNOW IT'S A PROVOCATIVE

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:47.344
IDEA WHICH IS FORCE THE STATE

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:50.013
TO EXPLORE THE LIMITS OF WHAT

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:50.514
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN BE

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:53.584
COMPELLED TO DO. BUT RIGHT NOW.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.252
I BELIEVE MUST BE ABOUT

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:56.787
BRINGING GOVERNMENTS TOGETHER

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:58.989
AS WORKING PARTNERS NOT

RESULTS TAKE ACTION. ARE YOU

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.645
