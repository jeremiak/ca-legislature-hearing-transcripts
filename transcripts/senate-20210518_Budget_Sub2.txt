MISS PETERSON GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING YOU MAY. BEGIN. GOOD MORNING SENATOR WHAT HOUSEKI HONORABLE SHARE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YES GOOD TO SEE YOU AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING AND I'M GOING TO PRESENT A SHORT OVERVIEW OF OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDED AS PART OF GOVERNOR NUISANCE MAY REVISE MY GRIEF OVER VIEW WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A MORE IN DEPTH PRESENTATION OF THE BROADBAND FOR ALL PROPOSAL BY ROBERT OSBORNE THE DIRECTOR OF THE CPC'S COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION. THE PROPOSAL THAN JUST GOING TO TOUCH ON BRIEFLY TODAY INCLUDE BROADBAND FOR ALL CALIFORNIA LIFELINE. A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO AN AUTHORIZED LEGAL SERVICES CONTRACT RELATED TO UTILITY BANKRUPTCY. AND AMERICANS FROM BANKRUPTCY. A PROPOSAL FOR OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE UNIT. AND THEN WE HAVE A NEGATIVE BUDGET PERTAINS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU AS PART OF THE- TRANSITION OF OUR WILD CARD FIFTY DIVISION. TO THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. AND WITH THE THINKING OF STATE HAS A PORTION OF THE CLEAN RESILIENT ENERGY PLAN I WON'T TOUCH ON THAT THIS MORNING BECAUSE THAT IS ALL A PART B. OF YOUR HEARING. BUT I WILL STAY ON THE LINE ALONG WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE CPC'S ACTIVITIES WITHIN. THAT MUCH LARGER PLANT. BROADBAND FOR ALL OUR PROGRAM IS DESIGNED AND PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR CALIFORNIANS. BY EXTENDING BROWN VERY BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE TO HARD TO REACH AND HIGH COST AREAS. EXPANDING AFFORDABLE BROADBAND FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND COMMUNITIES. AND IMPROVING INTERNET SPEEDS FOR UNDERSERVED CUSTOMERS. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES INFRASTRUCTURE COMPETITIVE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND AUTHORITY AND TOOLS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND REGIONAL AGENCIES TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN BROADBAND ACCESS. MOST SIGNIFICANT IS A FOUR BILLION INVESTMENT TO CONSTRUCT A STATE OWNED OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK USING CALIFORNIA'S HIGHWAY AND UTILITY RIGHTS OF WAY. COMPLEMENTED BY A THREE BILLION INVESTMENT IN LAST MILE FACILITIES TO UNSERVED LOCATIONS. THE PROPOSAL TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE ONE HUNDRED BILL ABILITY OF FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE STIMULUS FONG. IT ALSO EXPANDS EXISTING IF YOU SEE UNIVERSAL SERVICE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO DATE IN MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD ELIMINATING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE INEQUITIES. BUT REQUIRE AN INVESTMENT OF FUNDS TO FINALLY CLOSE THE GAPS THAT THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE SO CLEAR. A PORTABLE AND HIGH QUALITY BROADBAND FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IS AN ACHIEVABLE GOAL AND OUR PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO HELP ACHIEVE IT. OUR CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO CONTINUE PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY AND ESSENTIAL WIRELESS AND WIRELINE SERVICE AT AFFORDABLE RATE TOO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WE PROPOSED AN INCREASE IN STATE OPERATIONS AND A SMALL DECREASE IN LOCAL ASSISTANCE. TO COVER THE PROJECTED PARTICIPATION AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL CODE NINETEEN RELIEF PROGRAMS COME TO AN END. IF YOU FACE TRIED TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE NON DISCRIMINATORY AND WITHOUT COMPETITIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ALSO STRIVE TO ADMINISTER IT TO MINIMIZE WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE. OUR PROPOSAL RELATED TO GET UTILITY BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. WITH THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE LEGAL SERVICES CONTRACT THAT CONTINUES THE ADVICE AND REPRESENTATION THAT WE HAVE RELIED ON FOR CORPORATE AND UTILITY FOR STRUCTURING FINANCIAL PROPOSAL SECURITIZATION AND OTHER POST BANKRUPTCY RELATED MATTERS. WHICH ARE IMPORTANT AS THE UTILITIES THAT ARE IN BANKRUPTCY EMERGE FROM THAT HE COULD REGAIN FINANCIAL STABILITYAND AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUE PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO PROPOSED THREE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND FROM VARIOUS SPECIAL FUNDS. ROBY AT LEAST THAT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE UNIT. IS IN RESPONSE TO AN AUDIT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE QUEEN I HAVE REALIZED THAT WE NEED AT THE POSITION IN ANY EVENT. STRENGTH IN THE UNIT PERFORMANCE AND ENABLE US TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE REPORTING AND PAYMENT OF RECEIVABLES BY THE ENTITIES THAT WE REGULATE BECAUSE MILITARY CHARGES IN TURN FUNDED THE PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM. I WOULD JUST REITERATE THAT- WE ARE ALL HARD AT WORK ON THE TRANSITION OF OUR WILD CARD FIFTY DIVISION TO THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. TO BECOME THE NEW OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY AND THE NEGATIVE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU. ACHIEVE THAT TRANSFER. AND THEN LAUGHED AGAIN I CAN STAY ON AS- PART B. OF THE HEARING TO TALK ABOUT THE CPC'S ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CLEAN ENERGY RESILIENT PLANTS CLEAN RESILIENT ENERGY PLANT PART OF ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND ALSO ROBERT OSBORNE IS READY TO PRESENT MORE DETAIL ON THE BROADBAND FOR ALL PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PRESENTATION AND THEN HAVE MEMBERS HAVE THEIR QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS SO- MR OSBORNE- PLEASE GO FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE BACKGROUND THE PROBLEM AND HOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S MAY REVISION PROPOSALS ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM. THE FIRST ON THE BACKGROUND WHAT THE PANDEMIC IT'S MADE CLEAR THAT FAST RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE BROADBAND ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORT REMOTE LEARNING. FELLOW WORKS HELLO HELP INTO THE CORNERSTONE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IT LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN INTERNET ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY PERCENT. THE PROPOSAL WOULD HELP COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO DRIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT BY FINDING JOBS FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. FOR HIGH SPEED BROADBAND IS MISSING OR INSUFFICIENT INCREASE ECONOMIC EXPANSION ENABLED DISTANCE LEARNING TELEWORKING TELEMEDICINE. THE CIVICALLY FAST RELIABLE NON DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS ENABLED CONNECTION TO COMMUNITIES WHERE THE BARRIERS TO CONNECTIVITY HAVE SEVERAL LAYERS THE PRIMARY ONE BEING A LACK OF MIDDLE MILE PREVENTING A LAST MILE PROVIDERS FROM GOING THERE. IN THE MIDDLE MILEAGE EITHER NONEXISTENT OR TOO EXPENSIVE TO BUILD OR LEASE. AT A HIGH LEVEL BROADBAND NETWORKS ARE GROUPED INTO THREE CATEGORIES YOU HAVE BACKBONE WHICH IS A LONG HAUL NETWORK. THIS IS COMPOSED OF TRANSCONTINENTAL CABLES THAT RUN ALONG INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS AND RAILWAYS. YOU HAVE MIDDLE MILE WHICH IS THE HIGH CAPACITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONNECTION BETWEEN COMMUNITIES OR NODES THAT CONNECT THESE NODES TO THE WIDER INTERNET. AND FINALLY LAST MILE WHICH ARE THE CABLES WIRES OR INTENT AS THE CONNECT HOUSES AND BUILDINGS TO THE CLOSEST MIDDLE MOM DOES. DALY ALL MIDDLE MILE NAY. IN OPERATION THEIR SINGLE PURPOSE AND MEANING THEY ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY A SINGLE PROVIDER. THE LACK OF THEM AVAILABLE MIDDLE MILE INFRASTRUCTURE IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN CONNECTING CALIFORNIA'S UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE CAN PROVIDE AFFORDABLE SERVICE FOR ANCHORAGE DETECTION AND REDUCE THE PRICE OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS. BY ENABLING COMPETITIVE LAST MILE NETWORKS. LAST MILE INFRASTRUCTURE RELIES ON MIDDLE MILE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO RESIDENTS LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES SCHOOLS GOVERNMENT OFFICES PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES LIBRARIES. AND A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PROBLEM. I CAN ONLY EIGHTY THREE POINT 4% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE USING BROADBAND AT ANY SPEED BUT ONLY JUST OVER HALF ARE USING BROADBAND THE HUNDRED MEGABIT PER SECOND BENCHMARK. SERVICE BELOW A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND IS NOT ENOUGH FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE JUGGLING THE DEMANDS OF DISTANCE LEARNING TELEWORK ONLINE HEALTH CARE. AS WELL AS ACCESSING GOVERNMENT SERVICES. MURLE COMMUNITIES ARE HIT THE HARDEST WITH FIFTY ONE POINT 3% OF RURAL HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TO ANY BROADBAND AT A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND. AND ALMOST HALF THE HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT ACCESS TWO HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND I LOCATED IN URBAN AREAS. TRIBAL LANDS ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED WITH TWENTY EIGHT POINT 4% OF HOMES LACKING THE POTENTIAL BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE STATE'S LARGEST INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OFFER REDUCE COSTS PROGRAMS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS BUT SUBSCRIBER SHIP WITH LIMITED WITH ONLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND SUBSCRIBED. GROUNDS ARE NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE ESTIMATED TWO POINT THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS FALLING BELOW CALIFORNIA'S TARGET LEVEL. CALIFORNIANS RELY ON SUBSIDIES TO PRIVATE COMPANIES TO BRING BROADBAND SERVICE TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- BUT THAT APPROACH IS NO LONGER EFFECTIVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STILL UNSERVED. LACKED SUFFICIENT POPULATION DENSITY HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR TOO EXPENSIVE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REACH TO BE PROFITABLE SO WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC SECTOR ASSISTANT THESE IMPORTANT HIGH COSTS YOU NEED UNABLE TO GET CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. AT THE SAME TIME PARTS OF URBAN COMMUNITIES LACK ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY BROADBAND WHEN THEY'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE BROADBAND WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHOICE. THE MAY REVISED PROPOSALS AND TO DO THE FOLLOWING FIRST CONSTRUCTED STATE ON MIDDLEMAN THAT WORK USING A COMBINATION OF STATE LOCAL AND PRIVATELY OWNED RIGHT OF WAY. THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK WILL EXPAND ACCESS AND CAPACITY FOR NEW AND EXISTING LAST MILE NETWORKS AND PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. THIS WILL BRING IN NEW PROVIDERS OFFER MORE OPTIONS TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND LOWER SERVICE COSTS. SECOND ADDITIONAL LAST MILE FUNDING TO CONNECT TO THE MIDDLE MILE. THIRD SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT CAN RAISE MONEY TO DEPLOY IT WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS- FORGE MAKES SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME FUNDING AVAILABLE TO EXPEDITE UPGRADES IN AREAS SERVED BY SMALL INDEPENDENT TELECOM CORPORATIONS. THE FOUNDATIONAL INVESTMENT BUILD ONCE BILL RIGHT AND BUILD FOR THE FUTURE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS DIGITAL TREE NINETY FIVE WHICH CONNECTS BARSTOW TO RENO WHEN IT WAS BUILT BUILDER INSTALLED TO CONDUCT ONE WITH FIBER ONE WITHOUT. ONE WITHOUT IT'S REALLY BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE IS THE COMPLETE FIBER IN AT A LATER TIME. AN OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK WILL PROVIDE THE BACKBONE FOR LAST MILE PROVIDERS TO SERVE CONSUMERS LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES SCHOOLS GOVERNMENT OFFICES PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES LIBRARIES. THIS ENABLES LAST MONTH PROVIDERS TO SERVE HIGH COST AREAS. I'D CONNECTIVITY TO MORE THAN ONE PROVIDER INCREASING COMPETITION AND AFFORDABILITY AND THEN FINALLY SUPPORT UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBJECTIVES IMPROVES OVERALL NETWORK REDUNDANCY. IN THIS CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW. VERY GOOD- LET'S HEAR FROM THE ALEJO FROM. WE HAVE COMMENTS ON THE- CPUC AROUND PROPOSALS. GOOD MORNING MR SHARON NUMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- INSTANCE THE REVISION WAS JUST RELEASED A FEW DAYS AGO WE HAVE HAD ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO REVIEW- THE UC PROPOSALS ON THE REST OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET- WE STILL HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY COMMENTS WE DON'T HAS- ON THE ITEMS ON ISSUE ONE ON THE UC. AGENDA WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF IMMEDIATE ISSUES TO RAISE I THINK THE ONLY ONE I DID WANT TO FLAG WAS THE PROPOSED TRANSFER OF THE WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION TO THEN- OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY HI THERE IS THIS- A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STAFFING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- SHIFT AND TRANSFER- THAT- PROPOSALS BEING LED BY THE RESOURCES AGENCY- SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO DISCUSS THAT MORE IN THE NEXT PART OF YOUR HEARING ALL RIGHT OR RELIGION TO- BUT I JUST WANT TO LIKE THAT ONE ISSUE AND I DON'T WANT. FOR THE- BIGGER PROPOSAL AROUND BROADBAND I'M GONNA HAND OVER HAND IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN NOT STORE FOR SOME OF OUR NATIONAL. COMMENTS ON THAT. THANK YOU. THE MORNING METZ LEDGE. ANALYST'S OFFICE- AS ROSS MENTIONED SOME OF THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS NOT YET AVAILABLE SO WE WILL PROVIDE OUR HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS AT THIS HEARING. AND FOLLOW UP WITH A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS. UP FIRST IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES TWO BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THESE FUNDS WOULD BE AUTHORIZED FOR USE UNDER A NEW BUDGET CONTROL SECTION. THAT ALSO CONTAINS INTENT LANGUAGE FOR ANOTHER FIVE BILLION IN FUNDING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. OF WHICH THREE POINT FIVE BILLION AS FEDERAL FUNDS AND ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. IS GENERAL FUND- IT IS UNCLEAR TO US WHY THE INTENT LANGUAGE FOR FUNDING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IS NECESSARY WHEN THESE AMOUNTS. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION IN THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE. AND MORE OVER SEVERAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSALS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ADDITIONAL BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. AND SO THEREFORE MIGHT BE PREMATURE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER MEMORIALIZING IT'S INTENSE IN THE BUDGET ACT. TO COMMIT FIVE BILLION INCLUDING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN STATE FUNDS- IN THE NEXT. BUDGET CYCLE WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE DISCOMFORT OR FUNDING COULD BE AVAILABLE BY THEN. A SECOND THE PROPOSAL ESTIMATES THE COST OF A MIDDLE MILE OPEN ACCESS. BROADBAND NETWORK AT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS USING A NEW COST ESTIMATES THAT CALCULATES THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE COST PER MILE. FOR CALTRANS TO PERFORM THE WORK. AND THE ESTIMATED TOTAL NUMBER OF MILES TO BE INSTALLED WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS FOR EXISTING OR PLANNED NETWORKS- IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY OF THE BROADBAND ACTION PLAN INCLUDED ANOTHER COST MODEL THAT ESTIMATED. THE COST OF A SIMILAR NETWORK IN HEORY- AT TWO POINT TWO BILLION WHICH IS ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION LESS THAN WHAT'S ESTIMATED NOW. WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REQUEST MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEW COST TESTAMENT. AND ASK FOR A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO COST MODELS- THIRD THE FOCUS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL HERE'S TOLD. BE ON LONGER TERM BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. AND NOT ON SHORTER TERM ASSISTANCE WITH BROADBAND ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. AND NEW ACCOUNTS AND PROJECTS ARE IDENTIFIED INSTEAD OF CHANGES IN EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND FOURTH IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER SI PC OR AND OR OTHER STATE ENTITIES. WILL TAKE OTHER ACTIONS TO ENSURE THE STATE MAKES COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BROADBAND ACTION PLAN THE ADMINISTRATION RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF DATA ABOUT BROADBAND AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY IN THE STATE. AND SO FAR WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY INVESTMENTS- BETTER PROPOSED IN STATE OPERATIONS TO GATHER AND ANALYZE THAT ADDITIONAL DATA TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING INFORMED INVESTMENT. IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO. AS WE GATHER MORE DATA AND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL WILL SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS OF IT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING TO COLLECT. THAT IS SUBMITS A FAST MOVING TRAIN HERE ON THIS YEAH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. FINANCE WOULD YOU CARE TO. RESPOND TO ANY OF THE FOURPOINTS THAT ALEJO REYES OR I CAN GO BACK TO MISS PETERSON IF THAT'S IF YOU'D LIKE TO HANDLE IT. I'LL JUST BE TO A MAN NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THE CONTROL SECTION THAT WE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET TO BUILD IN A MECHANISM TO RECEIVE AN ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDS. BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION WAS IS WHY DO WE COMMIT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION NOW WITH STATE FUNDS. IF THEY MAY PICK UP THE WHOLE TAB. ALL RIGHT. I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE NOT COMMITTING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS FOR THE TWO BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE'D LIKE TO SIGNAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- INDICATES THAT THE TOTAL. OZELL SHOULD COME TO SEVEN BILLION. OKAY MISS PETERSON IS THAT HOW YOU SEE THINGS THAT THE CPUC. MEDIC OF THE VALLEY I WAS ASKING WHY IS THE INTENT OF LANGUAGE NECESSARY. IF WE COULD RIGHT NOW- THEN WE ALL WANT TO HAVE BEEN SENATORS. PARDON ME SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND- WE WILL KEEP ON WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO CLARIFY AND UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH FOR THE LANGUAGES. GOOD WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT- MR OSBORNE ON THIS- THE TWO POINT TWO MILLION BILLION FOR THE ESTIMATED COST PER MILE PURSES THE CALTRANS- FOR BILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE THIS SEEMS LIKE A- A BIG CHUNK IN FIVE MONTHS OR CHANGE. YEAH ALL RIGHT AND HAD THAT OKAY THREE CAN MISTER OSBORNE OUR TEAM HAS BEEN HARD AT WORK AT A NUMBER OF COST ESTIMATE FOR THIS ENTIRE PROPOSAL BUT LET ME HAND IT TO HIM THANK YOU. SO THANK YOU CENTER AND THANK YOU RACHEL PLAYED A HIGH LEVEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- THE COST ESTIMATE THAT WE PRODUCED FOR THE BROADBAND ACTION PLAN WAS BASED ON A COST MODEL. AND IT USED- DISTANCE BETWEEN LOCATIONS AS THE CROW FLIES SO. ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING FROM POINT A TO POINT B. IN THE AIR AS OPPOSED TO USING ACTUAL ROAD MILES SO THAT'S THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE. ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IS THE MIX OF UNDERGROUND VERSES AERIAL THAT WE USE SO. THE NUMBER THAT WE HAVE FOR NOW BUT FOR BILLING IS BASED ON UNDERGROUND PRIMARILY AS OPPOSED TO A LARGER MAKES AN AERIAL PERSONS UNDERGROUND SO WE SEE THAT NUMBER. EVENTUALLY CHANGING AS WE GET DOWN TO IMPLEMENTATION. WELL EVEN A GUY LIKE ME RESTAURANTS FOR KNOWS THAT UNDERGROUND COST A WHOLE LOT MORE MONEY THAN THAN THAN ARIEL AND- THE BRINGS US TO THE THIRD POINTED THE L. A. O. RACES THAT. WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR BIG ADDITIONS CHANGES THEY SUGGEST THAT MAYBE SOME OF THESE WHY NOT FOCUS ON SOME OF THE SHORT TERM. FIXES WERE IT'S JUST A MATTER PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE INTERNET I MEAN THEY THEY SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THE INTERNET AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR- THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A LOT OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE AT. LEAST THAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. IS PEOPLE JUST NEED AN UPGRADE OF THEIR THE SYSTEM THAT THE THIRD VICTIM THEIR HOUSES IT'S CRASHING. IN THE WHITE HOUSE THE HOUSE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT ONE MY- WIFE WORKING ON HER DISSERTATION AND MY SON WORKING ON HIS THESIS IS. THAT TIME FOR THE SENATOR SO WHY. NOT PUT SOME FOCUS ON THAT. SO THERE'S A COUPLE ELEMENT BUT WE'RE FOCUSING ON AS WELL TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM THE FIRST IS ON THE LIFELINE SIDE WHERE IT WILL CONSIDERING WAYS THAT WE AND THERE'S ALREADY A FEDERAL PROGRAM UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW FOR THE EMERGENCY BROADBAND BENEFIT THAT IS LOOKING TO SUBSIDIZE BROADBAND FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. ON THE AFFORDABILITY BY. THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE IS. IN COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE BROADBAND FORD ABILITY AS AN OPTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND WHAT THIS MIDDLE MOM PROPOSAL WILL DO. IS PROVIDE OPTIONS FOR LAST MILE PROVIDERS SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A ONE PROVIDER ONE TOWN SITUATION- THE OPEN ACCESS ALLOWS. MULTIPLE PROVIDERS TO. IF WE GET ON THE NETWORK ACCESS TO COMMUNITIES SO WITH WITH SERVE MATCH WITH HOUSEHOLDS BUT ALSO LIBRARY PUBLIC SAFETY- HOSPITALS ALL THE COMMUNITY ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SO THE FOCUS IS REALLY UP SERVING THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. I DO HAVE SOME IDEAS JUST FOR US AS A WORKING MODEL HOW MUCH OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE A DEFICIENCY OKAY THAT'S GREAT HOW MUCH OF THAT IS. THE BILL. COMMUNITY OR THE BILL MIDDLE MILE AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS JUST THIS. LOCALIZE I CAN'T AFFORD THE BROADBAND OR YOU KNOW THE BROADBAND RUNS RIGHT PAST MY HOUSE I JUST. I'M NOT IN ON IT BECAUSE WHEN WE WHEN WE HEAR THESE NUMBERS RECEIVING NUMBERS AND THIS AND THAT. NEWSPAPER ON THE RADIO IT'S A GIGANTIC NUMBER YOU'VE FIFTH MISS PETRSON. TOLD US ABOUT IT BUT HOW MUCH OF THAT IS REALLY JUST. APPLE COMPUTER ALL UP WITH SOME SORT OF MINIMUM FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH CHARGE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR BROADBAND VERSUS THIS- TURN UP THE ROAD AND BRING IN THE MIDDLE MILE AND CREATED THIS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE LAST MILE YOU KNOW PROVIDERS. HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU MORE DETAILS ON THAT SENATOR. ON THE WITH THE GAP BETWEEN WHERE YOU HAVE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM PERSISTS AND ACCESS PROBLEM. AND YOU THINK THAT BY THE HAVING THIS OPEN ACCESS FOR THE MIDDLE MILE SORT OF. EQUALIZES THINGS A DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING LEFT OUT OF THE BIG BROADBAND GAME. IS AT THAT IS THAT THE THEORY THERE AT THE CPUC. THAT'S CORRECT SO THE MINIMUM PROPOSAL IS BASED ON CONNECTING ALL THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE BEEN ARE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND AND- SO WE PUT THAT THAT PLAN TOGETHER. AND IT RUNS ALONG STATE HIGHWAYS WHEN WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN WE OBVIOUSLY WILL FOCUS NOT JUST ON STATE RIGHT AWAY BUT ALSO. CITY AND COUNTY AND PRIVATE RIGHT THE WAY- BUT THE BENEFIT FOR THE MIDDLE MILE UP PROPOSAL INCLUDE NOT JUST CONNECTING THE HOUSEHOLDS BUT PROVIDING BUT CONNECTIVITY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN. DO THEIR WORK THEY CAN DO- TELEWORK TELEMEDICINE ACCESS GOVERNMENT SERVICES IT ALSO PROMOTES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT AS- A BASELINE THAT PUBLIC CONNECTED. CITIZENRY AS OPPOSED TO HAVING THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS WHICH THE SITUATION WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. GOTCHA- LET'S HEAR FROM. RURAL CENTERED RECOGNIZED YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OVER HERE JUST ABOUT TO LOSE IT- FIRST OFF I WANT TO TALK MISTER CALDERON UP SOME I'M AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT BROADBAND FOR MINUTE. AND I THINK THE INTENT LANGUAGE IT NEEDS TO BE WE NEED TO HAVE THE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND I THINK IT IS TIME FOR US TO REALLY CONNECT AND BUT THIS IS THAT THIS THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO. IF YOU GO LOOK AT DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE WHICH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. PUT IN THERE I THINK THERE'S LIKE ONE PERSON HOOKED UP. IT'S THE- IT'S THE ABILITY TO GET ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN IT'S IN PLACE AND I'M FROM A RURAL COMMUNITY AND I AND I REPRESENT MOST OF THE RULES THE SOME OF THE RULES PARTS OF THE STATE THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S THEIR- PRIVATE COMPANIES LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE. THE RAIL LINE RUNS UP. BOB TWO FIVE FIVE AND THERE'S A RAIL LINE THAT GOES ALL THE WAY TO WASHINGTON IN EIGHTEEN T. HAS A LINE THAT RUNS RIGHT TO DUNN'S MERE THAT IS HI SPEED INTERNET WHICH CONNECTS THE WESTERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES. AND MY COMMUNITY COULD NOT HAVE GONE TO THAT LINE BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T THAT THAT DOES NOT IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. WE DO CAST A FUNDS WE DO ALL KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO CONNECT RULE AMERICA. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING IT DONE I THINK THIS SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS SHOULD BE PUT IN THERE BUT THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW WE GO ABOUT IT WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN. THE MIDDLE MILE- CAN'T CONNECT pTO IT DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD. IF AND I. ASK YOU TO GO LOOK AT DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE AND FIGURE OUT HOW MANY. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HOW MANY PEOPLE SERVICE. THIS IS NOT A GOOD USE FOR MONEY WE NEED TO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET. PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE SERVICES AND- IS IN THE SENATOR Y. CASKEY TALKED ABOUT HIS HOUSEHOLD. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY HOUSEHOLD. I LIVE. WAY OUT THE BODIES I HAVE A SATELLITE. DISH ON THE TOP OF MY SHOP WHICH I GET. IS THE COMPANY'S CALLED COMPARE. TO THEM. I HAVE KIDS DISTANCE LEARNING RIGHT NOW AT HOME. WITH VERY VERY POOR. INTERNET THERE IS NO BROADBAND OUT THERE. AND I HAVE A LAND LINE AND IT DOESN'T WORK AND I'M SO. I GUESS MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT I THINK THAT. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMEND. THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING THAT. PUTTING THE MONEY UP BUT I WANT TO KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND IT BECAUSE- QUITE FRANKLY WE SHOULD. ALLOCATE TO SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA USE EVERY BIT OF IT TO CONNECT. THOSE UNDERSERVED AREAS WHICH I AND CENTER REQUIRED. REPRESENT WE ACTUALLY PASSED A BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO DO DIGITAL. TO NINETY NINE TO AND IT'S STILL NOT IMPLEMENTED SO I GUESS FOR ME THE FRUSTRATION COMES. IN GETTING THE PRODUCT TO THE PEOPLE. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE DETAIL ON HOW WE DO THAT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S ROOM SENATOR GONZALEZ IS RUN AND ANOTHER BILL TO DO CAST A FUNDS AND WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT WE HAVE THESE. NON PROFITS THAT ARE SUPPOSEDLY GETTING US THIS INFORMATION BUT WE THERE HAS TO BE SOME ABILITY TO BRING THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE WITH THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE AVAILABLE TO US TO CONNECT. CALIFORNIANS TO WORLD CLASS WE SHOULD HAVE WORLD CLASS- INTERNET HERE AND WE DON'T IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S JUST IT'S APPALLING TO ME THAT WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT AND WE'VE SPENT. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE TALK ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS I THINK WE SHOULD COMMIT THE MONEY. NOT PUT IT INTO LANGUAGE COMMITTED AND LET'S GO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS DONE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. COMMUNITIES CANNOT SURVIVE. ECONOMICALLY WILL FURTHER HEALTH CARE FOR SCHOOLS FOR LIBRARIES. FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO DO BUSINESS ONLINE IN LESS WE GET THEM THE ACTUAL SERVICE AND NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT THE MIDDLE MILE DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD UNLESS YOU GET THE LAST MILE WITH IT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN HEARING FROM NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA LET'S TURN IN NORTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA SENATE MCGUIRE YOU RECOGNIZE THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCH HERE- I'LL TAKE. A TWO MINUTES OR LESS NUMBER ONE THERE'S A REASON WHY RURAL CALIFORNIA PER CAPITA HAS THE HIGHEST RATES. ADULT POVERTY HIGHEST RATES OF CHILDHOOD POVERTY HI IT'S RATES OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES HIGHEST RATES OF HOMELESSNESS. HIGHEST RATES OF UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. IN HIGHEST RATES OF OPIATE ADDICTION. THE LACK OF THE ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO EARN A CAREER JOB. IT'S ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT THESE RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA GONNA SUCCEED IS HAVING ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. IN RIGHT NOW BUT WE'D LIKE IT'S JUST TO HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET. ACCESS TO A CELL PHONE SIGNAL THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. SO I AGREE WITH- MY COLLEAGUES AT CENTER DOLLY ON THE DETAILS A FEW ITEMS NUMBER ONE THIS STATE CANNOT COUNT ON LEGACY CARRIERS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. IS BEING CANDID ABOUT IT AND NOT TRYING TO THROW THE MONEY TO BUY US. EIGHTEEN T. VERIZON COMCAST FRONTIER THEY'RE GONNA DO WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE THE TOUGH CONVERSATION TO FORCE COMPANIES TO ALLOW ACCESS TO THEIR LIFE FIBER LINES. THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH DISCUSSION. THREE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE MOST UNDERSERVED. THAT'S GONNA BE BOTH RURAL AS WELL AS URBAN FOUR WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC OPTIONS AND HOW TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH BROADBAND DISTRICTS OR ADD ON TO COMMITTEE SERVICE DISTRICTS THREE WOULD PROVIDE BROADBAND OPTIONS. FIVE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE RIGHT NOW WHERE I THINK THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE IS GOING TO BE OUR SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THE CHALLENGES SPECIALLY FOR ROLE GOVERNMENTS THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL OR THE ENGINEERING WE GOTTA FOCUS ON SPECIFIC TECHNICAL SYSTEMS MARKETS. IN IN SIX- I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS RIGHT WHAT I WOULD ASK MISTER CHAIR. IS TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH. A COMMITTEE OF URBAN AS WELL AS RURAL INTERESTS TO COME TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO CONSULT. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND HOW THIS IS GONNA ROLL OUT. WE HAD A GROUND TRUTH- SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK RURAL CALIFORNIA HAS AND HOW TO BE A NAVIGATE FORWARD. MISTER TERRY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND APPRECIATE THE TIME. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISS PETERSON MISTER OSBORNE. THAT WAS HOPEFULLY ENLIGHTENING ON THE AT LEAST THE SENATE. VERSIONS OF THE INITIAL ROLLOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THEY WILL MOVE ON TO THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- WITH THAT SAID I UNDERSTAND THANK. I UNDERSTAND FOR THE- ISSUE NUMBER THREE BEFORE WE DO THAT. THE CHECKER LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM FOR THIS- CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. BY CAL SKI HERE DOLLY HERE MCGUIRE STERN. ASTEC FORM IS ESTABLISHED ANALYSTS HAVE I THINK COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN YOU WERE ON THE CALLS AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING PLEASE PROCEED. MORNING WELL IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE- MY NAME'S PATTY MONAHAN I'M A COMMISSIONER AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND I AM GOING TO PROVIDE A VERY HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY AND THE NAY REVISED PROPOSAL TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION BUDGET. I'M ALSO GONNA LEAD AND DEEP DIVE DISCUSSION INTO THE CLEAN ENERGY PACKAGE WHICH HAS COPIED THE IMPLICATION. FOR ME REVISED PROPOSES THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION MANAGE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS. AND ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR IN THE FOLLOWING THREE CATEGORIES FIRST THEIR EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANUFACTURING. SECOND CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND FINALLY A CLEAN RESILIENT ENERGY PACKAGE. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL HELP THE STATE DECARBONISE SO THE BIGGEST AND MOST CHALLENGING SECTORS INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRY. THEY'RE ALSO ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES LIKE LONG DURATION STORAGE AND NEW OFFSHORE WIND WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL 321100% CLEAN GRIN AND A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE PROPOSAL FOR THEIR MISSION VEHICLE IN CONSTRUCTION MANUFACTURING IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT SECTION ON THAT FROM GOING TO STATE STREET GLOBAL- GO THERE'S- RESOURCES BOARD AND IDENTITY ENERGY COMMISSION ARE COORDINATING. CLOSELY ON THE THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR MULTI AGENCY THREE YEAR PACKAGE TO ACCELERATE ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE. ENERGY COMMISSION WOULD MANAGE ONE POINT ONE SIX FIVE BILLION OVER THREE YEARS AND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION. A YEAR. YEAH 85% OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING IS FOR THE BUILD OUT OF YOUR MACHINE VEHICLE FOR EXAMPLE INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR CALIFORNIANS CAN FEEL CONFIDENT THAT NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE WHERE THEY LIVE IN THE NORTHERN PART WHICH THAT QUESTION- DOLLY LIVES WITH EACH OTHER PARTS. THAT THEY CAN REFUEL THEIR THEIR MISSION VEHICLE. THE COUPLE BUDGET PUT CALIFORNIA ON COURSE TO RAPIDLY SCALE UP ELECTRIC ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE COMMERCIALIZATION INCREASE JOBS BUILDING OUT NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE ALSO HELPING ME. GOVERNESSES EXECUTIVE ORDER ON YOUR MACHINE VEHICLES. ON CLIMATE RESILIENCE BUT PROPOSES A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION OVER TWO FISCAL YEARS. TO HELP MEET THE STATE'S PRIORITY CHRONICLES AND ADDRESS CLIMATE RESEARCH IN EXTREME HEAT. THIS FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT A NEW GRANT PROGRAM A FIFTY MILLION PER YEAR FOR TWO YEARS. TO MAKE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WITH MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF A WARMING CLIMATE. THE COUNTRY LANES PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE CHEST CLIMATE ASSESSMENT THE NEW TRAVEL GRANT PROGRAM FOCUSING ON FILLING RESEARCH GAPS. I'M GONNA TALK OF QUICKLY ABOUT IT. YEAH NEAR AND DEAR TO THE HEART OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION WHICH START PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE- THE ENERGY RESOURCES PROGRAM ACCOUNT FOR- BUSTER SHORT. AND MANY OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE NOW FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- HAS BEEN IN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. AND IT'S BEEN AUTHORIZED TO SPEND MORE MONEY THAN IT'S TAKING IN EACH YEAR AND THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL. AWAY COULD FIX THIS PROBLEM. SO NOW. VERY DEEP DOWN- THE- RESILIENT ENERGY PACKAGE. THE ENERGY PACKAGE PROPOSES TO INVEST NINE HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION ACROSS SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS. PUBLISHED ENERGY COMMISSION WOULD MANAGE A TOTAL OF EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION. THIS PACKAGE WILL HELP CALIFORNIA REACH A 100% CARPENTRY GRADE AND A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE COMBINATION OF PLANNING AND ANALYSIS. YOUR MISSION GENERATION STORAGE AND EFFICIENCY. THE PACKAGE OF THREE TRANCHES OF INVESTMENTS THE FIRST OUR ENERGY UPGRADES FOR INDUSTRIAL AND FOOD PROCESSING FACILITIES. THE SECOND IS LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE AND THE FINAL IS A SUITE OF INVESTMENTS FOR GREEN HYDROGEN OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENT AND SB ONE HUNDRED TRAINING. THE PACKAGE WAS DEVELOPED IN COORDINATION WITH MY AGENCY THE ENERGY CHRISTIAN PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. ATTENTION COUNCIL THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE PACKAGES INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO HELPING DECARBONISE OUR ECONOMY AND ACHIEVE OUR CLEAN ENERGY AND GREEN ECONOMY GOALS. THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE CARBONIZED INCLUDING ELECTRIFICATION GREEN HYDROGEN BY A GAS AND OTHERS ARE CURRENTLY TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGING AND THEY ARE EXPENSIVE. THE DEMON VESSELS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING ARE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO BOTH THE TRACK CUTTING EDGE INNOVATORS AND SHOULD NOT THE INDUSTRY THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ACHIEVING OUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE HE CARBONIZATION GOALS. SO THE FIRST CATEGORY OF CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS PROPOSED IS THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO CUT CARBON IN INDUSTRIAL AND FOOD PROCESSING FACILITIES. UNDER XI TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WOULD BE USED FOR INDUSTRY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION FOR FOOD PROCESSING. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER USE AND MORE THAN 20% OF THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE HOLLYWOOD SUPPORT THE NEW GRANT PROGRAM FOR INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION. IT WOULD ALSO EXPAND THE CURRENT FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES GRANTS TO CALIFORNIA FOOD PRODUCERS TO INSTALL ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. I JUST FOR A MINUTE ON THE FOOD PRODUCTION ABOUT THE PROGRAM SO FAR IT'S AWARDED FIFTY ONE GRANTS AT SIXTY SEVEN PROJECT SITE. 85% OF THOSE SITES ARE AND DISADVANTAGED. AND OR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE NEW FUNDING WILL SUPPORT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR EXISTING AND EMERGING HE CARBONATION TECHNOLOGIES AND STRATEGIES SUCH AS ELECTRIFYING PROCESSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE USE FOSSIL FUELS. INCORPORATING ENERGY STORAGE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY USING CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND EXPORT OTHER DECARBONIZATION STRATEGIES LIKE REMOVAL GAS OR SOLAR THERMAL. THE SAME CATEGORIES LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE THE BUDGET PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR THIS CATEGORY. LONG DURATION STORAGE IS REALLY KEY TO ENSURING RELIABLE AND RESILIENT. ELECTRICITY SERVICES SORRY I THINK MY DOG JUST OPEN MY DOOR- WE ARE USUALLY NOT AVAILABLE OR THE GREATEST DOWN FOR OTHER REASONS. CHEESY ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR ABOUT A ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OR GIGAWATTS OF LONG DURATION STORAGE BY TWENTY THIRTY AND FOUR GIGAWATTS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THIS ONE TIME FUNDING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADVANCE LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. PHASES THAT WILL SCALE THE TECHNOLOGY FROM SMALL SCALE. WITH MEDIAN DURATION LIKE EIGHT TO TEN HOURS. TWO LARGE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS WHICH WITH MUCH LONGER DURATION. WITHOUT THIS ONE TIME INSERTION OF FINDING THESE EMERGING LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. WILL BENEFIT A MUCH SLOWER PACE AND MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN THE TIME THAT WE NEED BY TWENTY THIRTY. FINALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES A SUITE OF INVESTMENT GREEN HYDROGEN I'M SURE WHEN AND SB ONE HUNDRED PLANNING TOTALING ONE HUNDRED THIRTY POINT NINE MILLION. OF THIS TOTAL A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION IS FOR CULTURE GREEN HYDROGEN. THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL USES OF CLEAN HYDROGEN AND ADVANCE THE STATE OF TECHNOLOGY ON PRODUCING AT. THREE HUNDRED AND SHOWS PROMISE AS A STRATEGY TO PROVIDE A ZERO CARBON SHIELD REPLACE NATURAL GAS FOR SOME APPLICATIONS SUCH AS HIGH TEMPERATURE INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES INCLUDING CONCRETE AND STEEL PRODUCTION. SOME GENERATION CAPACITY MAY BE NEEDED TO STABILIZE THE GRID- PROVIDING YOUR **** IN DRIVE MODE FOLLOWING RENEWABLES ARE NOT AVAILABLE. URBAN GENERATION SOURCE LIKELY HYDROGEN COULD PLAY THIS CRITICAL- WE WOULD USE THE FUNDING IN SEVERAL TECHNICAL AREAS INCLUDING BLENDING HYDROGEN WITH NATURAL GAS TO BE USED EXISTING POWER PLANTS WITH A GOAL OF REACHING A 50% CLEAN HYDROGEN PLANT. IN ADDITION THE FUNDING WILL ADDRESS THE ONSITE PRODUCTION THREE HUNDRED RIGHT NOW HYDROGEN PRIMARILY MADE TO FOSSIL FUELS THE CONVERSION OF NATURAL GAS. BUT WE WANT TO HAVE A ZERO CARBON RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS. PROCTOR WHEN THE BUDGET PROPOSES TWENTY MILLION TO SUPPORT IT YOUR AGENCY APPROACH. SIX POINT FIVE MILLION OF THIS PROPOSED FUNDING WILL SUPPORT A SERIES OF CROSS AGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES BY CALIFORNIA'S MOTION AGENCIES. WHAT THE STATE'S FEDERAL. RUBIO UNDER THE COASTAL COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT. THE COASTAL COMMISSION DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL ARE ALL HERE TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STUDIES. THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION IS FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO SUPPORT THE SWEET ACTIVITIES TO PERSONAL TO SHOW THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY. THIS SPRING BY LIMITATION ON A NATION WIDE GOAL OF THIRTY GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND BY TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS REALLY EXCITING- AFTER WIND ISN'T. INDUSTRY IN EUROPE AND IT'S QUICKLY EMERGING IN THE EAST COAST AND NOW WE WANT-TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER SEVERAL SCENARIOS THOUGH SB ONE HUNDRED LOOK REPORT SAYS WILL NEED AT LEAST TEN GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND. AND TO DO THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON HOW TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND BALANCES THE PARTY THE OTHER OCEAN USERS AND OCEAN AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES. INCLUDING COMMERCIAL FISHING. RESCUE ONE HUNDRED- IMPLEMENTATION AND EMERGENCY PLANNING THE BUDGET PROPOSES SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION IS PROPOSED THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THANK YOU EARLY THEY'RE HERE TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. SB ONE HUNDRED BECAUSE YOU KNOW REQUIRED THAT BY TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE THE GREAT BE 1100% CARBON FREE. PLANNING TECHNICAL ANNOUNCED- ANALYSIS AND ENGAGEMENT BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBES IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. IN ADDITION CATEGORY WOULD FIND. ENERGY EMERGENCY PLANNING TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND DATA COLLECTION. SO THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSED INVESTMENTS WILL HELP THE STATE WE COULD GOALS FOR CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY WHAT THE FORTY IN STATE COMPANIES AND WORKERS. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS IN THE DISCUSSION AND I'M ACCOMPANIED BY MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING FOR MY AGENCY YOUR AVAILABLE HAN OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LAURIE CAN HELP WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL THE BET YOU DIRECTOR FUELS AND TRANSPORTATION. NATHALIE LIEVEN. RENEWABLES FINALLY YOU LIKE HIGHLAND INVITE YOUR KIDS COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS SO REALLY WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS HERE READY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE- I LOOK FORWARD TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. VERY GOOD- LET'S HEAR FROM THE ALLEY- FIRST ON THE- ENERGY COMMISSIONS OVER YOU VIEW THE BUDGET. AND THEN THE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. IF YOU MISTER SURE FROM AGAIN WITH THE L. A. I'M FOCUS ON MIKE. ON THE CLEANER PACKAGE THE COMMISSION MONAGHAN JUST PRESENTED THAT SAYS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PACKAGE IN ADDITION TO THOSE ADS- AS YOU HEARD FROM COMMISSIONER MONEY AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING A VERY LARGE INCREASE IN SPENDING FOR CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS WITH MOST OF THAT FUNDING ACTUALLY GOING TO. THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ENERGY COMMISSION. AND SO BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY REVIEW WE DO HAVE TO A VERY HIGH LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE- FIRSTS TO ENSURE THE ULTIMATE PACKAGE THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS IS COORDINATED STRATEGIC AND COMPREHENSIVE. OUR RECOMMENDS CONSIDERING THIS PACKAGE IN TANDEM WEST SOME OF THE OTHER PROPOSED PACKAGES THAT YOU'RE GONNA HEARING THIS HEARING AND ELSEWHERE- FOR EXAMPLE RELATED TO CAP AND TRADE CLIMATE RESILIENCE YOUR MISSION VEHICLES. BUT IN COMBINATION ALL THE LEGISLATURE'S KIND OF RELATED PRIORITIES ARE REFLECTED ITS DESIRED LEVELS. AS I CAN I AGREE THAT IT WAS LIKE A EASTER EGG HUNT GOING THROUGH THE BUDGET TRYING TO LOOK AT THE RESILIENCE CLIMATE STUFF THE A. K. CAP AND TRADE. WILDFIRES AND THEN EACH BUDGET IN BETWEEN AND SAYING OKAY HOW TO I GOT YELLOW PAD I'M WRITING DOWN THINGS AND SAYING WHAT THIS IS ALL CONNECT. HOME SO. I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU YOUR SECOND POINT. YEAH SO THIS THE SAKE POINT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SPEND AND THEN OF I. THAT ARE BEING. IN THIS. DELIVERS MIGHT. THE FOR DECISIONS ON THIS PACKAGE UNTIL THIS SUMMER- IS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL'S ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF THE NEW PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES THAT ARE PART OF THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE- CRAFT IMPLEMENTING STATUTORY LANGUAGE TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND TO ENSURE THAT ALSO INCORPORATES KEY LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AS WE JUST DISCUSSED- MORE- KIND OF SPECIFICALLY I GUESS JUST SORT OF THOSE THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL. I WE DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S GENERALLY TARGETED AT PROMOTING TECHNOLOGIES IN AREAS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE CARBONIZATION GOALS THE CALIFORNIA HAS SET- BUT WORK COMMERCIAL SCALE TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT NOT YET BE AVAILABLE AND SO. WE THINK- YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF FOCUS IS REASONABLE AND CONCEPTS- BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND DETAILS THAT STILL. NEED TO BE WORKED OUT AND ANSWERED. A COUPLE THAT ALL HIGHLIGHTS. ONE OF A KIND OF KEY QUESTION TO THINK ABOUT IS. IS GENERAL FUND AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES ARE TYPICALLY IN THESE TYPES OF KIND OF CLEAN ENERGY ACTIVITIES ARE FUNDED DIRECTLY OR FUNDING OR OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS. HOWEVER WE DO THINK IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO THINK ABOUT USING ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF RATEPAYER FUNDING. FOR SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES AT LEAST INCLUDING THE INCENTIVES AND GRANTS- THIS IS. PARTLY BECAUSE AT AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHAT CHRISTIE RATES ARE ALREADY VERY HIGH WHICH RACES. ARE QUITE A FEW CONCERNS AROUND SORT OF JUST ENVIRONMENT ACHIEVING OF OUR MIDDLE GOALS ARE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES IN EQUITY CONCERNS. SO USING GENERAL FUND INSTEAD COULD PREVENT FUTURE. RATE INCREASES RATHER THAN KIND OF RELYING ON. ELECTRICITY RATEPAYERS. ALSO MANY OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE BROAD PUBLIC BENEFITS WHICH MEANS THERE COULD BE A REASONABLE CASE AND I'M ROLE FOR A STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT- AND I THINK I THINK THE ARGUMENT FOR GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR SOME OF THE OTHER PLANNING ACTIVITIES I. THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE STILL EXPLORING OR NOT. ENTIRELY SURE ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK FOR SOME OF THE- ON SERVICE. THERE IS A REASONABLE ARE- THE SECOND QUESTION- THEN I'LL IN MY FROM OR- IS HOW MUCH IS. SHOULD BE PLACED ON. INCREMENTAL IF THEY'RE GAINS AS PART OF THESE PROGRAMS. VERSUS PROMOTING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED FOR DEEP DECARBONIZATION- SOME OF THE PROGRAMS LIKE THE INDUSTRIAL PROPOSED INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION PROGRAM WOULD. MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR BOTH OF THESE THINGS BOTH ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS WELL AS- A NEWER TECHNOLOGIES LIKE GREEN HYDROGEN OR CARBON CAPTURE FOR EXAMPLE- ANYTHING IN GENERAL WE THINK PROMOTING EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGIES AGAIN IS IT A REASONABLE AREA OF FOCUS BUT THERE IS KIND OF A TRADE OFF THAT THOSE. TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE MORE EXPENSIVE AND FOCUSING ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY MIGHT BE A MORE. COST EFFECTIVE NEAR TERM STRATEGY- SO THAT'S JUST KIND OF ONE OF THE TRADE OFFS I THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IN WAYNE WHEN STRUCTURING THESE PROGRAMS IF FUNDING IS PROVIDED. HOW IT WANTS TO WAY KIND OF SOME OF THOSE LONG TERM GOALS IN PROMOTING NEW OR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. AGAINST COMMITTEE ON PERHAPS MORE COST EFFECTIVE BUT SORT OF SHORT TERM GOALS ARE. AND PROJECTS AROUND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. SO WE HAVE A SEVERAL OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THEY'RE LAID OUT IN YOUR AGENDA BUT I'M NOT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- IN MY COMMENTS THERE. THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU COULD TO TOUCH MINE. WE YOU'VE TOURED US FOR YEARS ABOUT- THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS ARE COVERED ENTITIES INCLUDING THE FOOD PROCESSING. INDUSTRY THAT THEY SHOULD THERE EMITTERS A CARBON DAY SHOULD PAY THEIR OWN WAY AND WE KNOW WE HAVE. A CARVE OUT THE CAP AND TRADE TO PAY FOR THEIR MANUFACTURES TAXES SO THEY DON'T PAY THIRTY TWO MILLION. DOLLARS AND THAT THIS IS. FOR YOU KNOW FOR PROCESSING TO REACH. A CAR FELL TO REDO THEIR AND- YOU IS. WHAT AN COMPANY TO. INCREASE IN THE FLOW PRICE ON THE CAP AND TRADE IS SORT OF FIFTY THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE IS A- A BALANCE BETWEEN OKAY WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THIS BUT THEN. YOU COULD PAY MORE EVERYBODY WILL PAY MORE. I'M GOING TO HEAR FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND WHAT THEY THINK IT'S- WITH. WHY SHOULD WE BE DOING THAT IS A LEGISLATIVE WHY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ONE INDUSTRY ADMITTEDLY IT MIGHT BE LOCATED IN A LOW INCOME AREA AND IT MEDICALLY IT MAY BE A GOOD ENERGY. A BIG ENERGY. USER BUT WHY WOULD WE- WHY WOULD WE WANT TO. FOCUS JUST ON THAT ONE INDUSTRY. YES I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE IS KIND OF IMPORTANT POINTS ON THAT QUESTION ONE IS JUST KIND OF BROADLY- YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE VERSUS YOU KNOW A STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE TECHNOLOGY OR SUPPORT A CERTAIN TYPES OF INDUSTRIES I THINK. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION A POINT THAT WE RAISED BEFORE AND WE DO THANK THE KIND OF TRYING TO PROMOTE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THE STATE'S FOCUS SHOULD LARGELY BE ON I HAVE BEEN TRAINED CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS SET UP IN A WAY. TO DO THAT AND IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S GOALS NOW THERE MAY STILL BE- HAVE A GOOD RATIONALE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON THINGS THAT MAYBE CAP AND TRADE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY INCENTIVIZE BUT ARE STILL KIND OF NEEDED OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED BUT A COUNTRY DOESN'T DO A GREAT JOB OF COVERING AND HANDLING AND SO. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS TO KIND OF PROMOTE YOU KNOW NEWER TECHNOLOGIES IN DEMONSTRATIONS MIGHT BE KIND OF A GOOD FIT FOR YOU SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS TO GO ALONGSIDE CONCENTRATE AGAIN ASSUMING AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE COUNTRY TO SET UP AND IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S GOALS. THAT'S ONE THING I THINK THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED SOME I WAS ALSO ONE OF OUR COMMENTS THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA AS BY THE ARGUMENT FOR- PROVIDING A SPECIFIC CAR ABOUT PROGRAMMER FUNDING FOR A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY SO- AS YOU NOTED THERE'S A PROGRAM FOR INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION ACTIVITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES AND THERE'S A SEPARATE PROGRAM FOR FOOD PROCESSING- INDUSTRIES AND SO I THINK- I THINK THAT A GOOD QUESTION I AM ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. THAT WAS ON OUR MIND WAS- WHAT IS THE SORT OF THE RATIONALE FOR. UNNECESSARY FOCUS ON JUST THE PROCESS INDUSTRY RATHER THAN JUST WALKING ABOUT MY INTO ONE. OF PROGRAM. AND FUNDING TO THE MOST MERITORIOUS. WITHIN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND SOME OF THOSE LIKE A FOOD PROCESSING BUT SOME OF IT MIGHT BE OTHER PROGRAMS AND SO. ANYTHING ABOUT THE DESIGN AND STRUCTURE OF FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT'S- KIND OF ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK AND I THINK ABOUT. HOW TO STRUCTURE THEM IN A WAY THAT KIND OF GETS OUT THE MOST MERITORIOUS PROJECTS WOULDN'T YOU'RE THINKING BEAT SINCE WE HAVE 80% OF THE MANUFACTURES ARE COVERED UNDER CAP AND TRADE. AT TARGETING THE OTHER 20% SORT OF THE SLOW LOPE PLAYERS THAT ARE ENERGY INEFFICIENT. OR THAT NEEDED DECARBONISATION AT THAT WOULD BE. A WISE WISE INVESTMENT. TO MOVE THAT SECTOR. ASIDE I MEAN WE'RE NOT. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE DON'T GIVE ANYTHING TO THE COVERED ENTITIES TO DECARBONISE THEM. BE NICE THAT WE USE OUR CAP AND TRADES TO ACTUALLY DECARBONIZE THE COMMUNITY RATHER THAN. WORK AFTER POLLUTION AND OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE. WONDERFUL BUT THEY DON'T DO THE JOB OF. THAT IS THAT IT IS AT A TARGET ARE. TARGETED IF WE DO GO FORWARD WITH THIS. LONG TERM. DICKER EFFORTS AT SHOULD BE LOOK AT THOSE ANTI ENTITIES. COVERED ENTITIES. YEAH I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF KIND OF THE PRINCIPLES IN AREAS THAT WE I THINK WE'VE OUTLINED THAT IS- WHAT ARE SORT OF REASONABLE AREA OF FOCUS ON KIND OF FOCUSING ON THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT COVERED LIKE YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE A SENSE TO MAKE IT MINISTRATION DOES ON KIND OF HOW MANY. ENTITIES THAT WOULD CAP THAT WOULD CAPTURE KIND OF THIS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL HOW MANY SORT OF SMALLER- INDUSTRIAL SOURCES ARE KIND OF OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITAL I THINK ONE THAT IS ONE REASONABLE SORT OF AREA TO EXPLORE AND ONE KIND OF REASONABLE CRITERIA TO USE TO. PART OF THE FUNDING IN ADDITION TO EVEN FOR THE LARGE PLAYERS THATARE COVERED AS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT- BUT IT THERE'S SORT OF A- PILOT AND DEMONSTRATION OF RATIONALE AND TECHNOLOGICAL- KIND OF PROMOTION ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM WHICH MEANS EVEN IF THEY ARE COVERED WE DO THINK THERE IS. SOME REASONABLE RATIONALE FOR GOING TO THE STATE PLAYING A ROLE IN AN AND PROMOTING THOSE TYPES OF THINGS FINANCING DELIVERY SPONSORED COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN. AND THEN WE'LL GO TO CENTER DOLLY. I'LL THE TO THAT IN COMMISSION. WELL I'M I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON A CAP AND TRADE WHAT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT FOR ME IS VERY DIFFICULT TO THE CARBONIZED SECTORS AND WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW STILL NATION. THAT THAT CAP AND TRADE DOESN'T DO A GOOD JOB OF INCENTIVIZING THOSE DEEP DECARBONIZATION INVESTMENTS THAT WE WILL NEED. THE SAME THING N THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHERE IT'S NOT EASY TO SWITCH ONE FUEL TO ANOTHER EXPENSIVE AND THERE'S- THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE AND THERE'S A COST THERE. AND SO WE WILL- YOU KNOW INVESTORS THAT ARE REALLY TARGETED. AND I THINK INDUSTRIAL IS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION SET YET FULLY MAPPED OUT. AND SO THESE INVESTMENTS ARE REALLY TO HELP THIS IMPORTANT SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO DECARBONISE. WHAT I WOULD CALL IT SERIES OF NEXT GENERATION INVESTMENTS I MEAN ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS PART OF THAT BECAUSE THAT REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WE HAVE TO USE FOR THESE. THESE ABOUT- MORE YOU KNOW EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT STRATEGIES- I DO HAVE A LOT OF STATES THAT WITH THE RIGHT SET OF HARDY DIDN'T INVESTMENTS. WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS IN THESE. NEXT GENERATION DECARBONIZATION STRATEGIES FOR THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR. MISS HOPE YOU'RE. RECOGNIZE I SAW YOUR HAND UP. I WAS JUST GOING THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO I'M GLAD. I'M LAURIE TENTO BY THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND I WOULD JUST ADD A COUPLE OF COMMENTS I THINK THIS AROUND IT'S REALLY ARTICULATED SON CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TRADE OFFS AND CONSIDERATIONS. AND PART OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE AFTER PROGRAM TO DATE IS THAT BY TARGETING COVERED ENTITIES. YOU'RE YOU'RE HELPING THOSE ENTITIES ACHIEVE THESE GHG REDUCTIONS EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BEEN KIND OF STUDYING- LEADERSHIP FOR THE ON COVERED ENTITIES TO FOLLOW. AND IT'S ALSO WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST- GHG REDUCTIONS SO I THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT IT- THE THINK ABOUT BOAST AND- COVERED ENTITIES AND ON COVERED ENTITIES- I'M JUST IT THE- AND SEE IF BY. WE WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS RIGHTS WORK WILL JUST WE'LL JUST ARTICULATED CENTER SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS ARTICULATED A DESIRE TO INCREASE THE FLOOR PRICE ON THE CAP AND TRADE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE. FOR THE POLLUTING AND POLLUTING POPULATION INCLUDING MANUFACTURERS TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO DO TAKE THE ACT ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE TO DO WE'RE NOT THAT FIRST TO HELPING HIM ALONG. BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T HAD THAT. BY INCREASING THE FLOOR PRICE THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF WHAT THE WORLD MARKET SAYING I KNOW THAT TEND TO THE AIRPORT. AND THEY HAVE BEEN. CITY AND NOT RESPONDING TO ANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE RAISED HERE SO WHAT. YOU KNOW. MAYBE WHEN YOU TALK TO THE- BOARD LET THEM KNOW THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN. IN A PARTNERSHIP WHERE THEY CAN RAISE THE FLOOR FLIGHTS SO WE'VE EVERYBODY CAN HELP OUT THAT COVERED ENTITIES WOULD BE INCENTIVIZED TO SAY. WHY ARE WE PAYING THESE ALLOWANCES RATHER LET'S PUT THIS EQUIPMENT ON AND NOW HERE'S SOME MONEY TO HELP THEM DECARBONISE RATHER THAN. A FREE TRAIN CHECKED YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S A- PART OF I THINK THAT THERE MAY BE SOME HESITATION FOR US TO. TO DO THAT CENTER DOLLY YOU RECOGNIZE WELL I JUST WANT TO. SAY YOU KNOW NOT ALL OF US HERE WANT TO RAISE THE FLOOR PRICE. MAYBE YOU TO MISTER. Y. CASKEY I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FOOD PROCESSOR NIGHT WOMEN'S WHEN EXPAND ON IT LOOKS. TO DO IT LOW AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ANYBODY THAT MANUFACTURES IN CALIFORNIA THAT COULD LEAVE IS ALREADY LEFT. BUT I HATE TO TELL YOU. THE PEOPLE THAT PROCESS FOOD AREN'T LEAVING BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY STILL FARM IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK IT'S- THE- IT'S MORE OF A CHARACTER IT'S MORE OF AN IDEA TO SAY HEY. WE CAN HELP THESE PROCESSORS- STAY IN CALIFORNIA AND PROCESS IN THESE LOW AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND HELP REDUCE THE CARBON INDUSTRIES WE TALK ABOUT. THE VALLEY- IN THE FOOD PROCESSORS ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S ONE OF THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE I ACTUALLY THINK WE CAN. HELP REDUCE CARBON AND IT'S AN INCENTIVE MORE THAN IT IS- A STICK- BUT I WANT TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT AND TALK ABOUT THE- BUT AND I JUST I HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND I JUST. BECAUSE BECAUSE THIS. CECE'S THE OTHER DUTIES THE SEA. OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION OF EXPANDED- THE ONLYACTIVITIES THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT RATEPAYERS FOR INSTANCE CLIMATE FOCUS POLICIES LIKE THE BUILDING INITIATIVE. FOR LOW EMISSIONS- DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OR THE MANDATE FOR SOLAR ON ALL NEW HOMES. ADDITIONALLY THE CC HAS RECENTLY ADOPTED MAJOR POLICIES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE INPUT SO I. AS A LEGISLATOR I LIKE SOLD ME RESEMBLES ALL SOLAR ON NEW HOMES BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION. WITHOUT MUCH OVERSIGHT FROM THE FROM US AND SO I HAVE A POLICY QUESTION. CAN WE EVEN PUT A SURCHARGE ON THE BEHIND THE METER CONSUMPTION. SO BASICALLY IF I IF I PUT SOLAR ON MY HOME AND I'M GENERATING MY OWN LECTURES CITY ARE THERE IS ARE GOING TO BE AN ASSESSMENT. TO MY ENERGY THAT I PRODUCE. THAT I'VE THAT I'M NOT GETTING OFF THE GRID. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION OF OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- TO BOTH HANDS. WELL DONE THANK YOU COMMISSION ON HAND THANK YOU SENATORS ARE SENATOR DOLLY. YOU RAISE GOOD QUESTIONS IN THAT THE SHORT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS YES OUR PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND THE- THE SURCHARGE THAT CURRENTLY APPLIES TO ALL RATE PAYERS- FOR THEIR METERED ELECTRICITY. AND IT AVERAGES TO ABOUT SIXTEEN CENTS PER MONTH PER RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYER IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO EXTEND THAT CHARGE TO THOSE. FOR WHOM THEY HAVE SOCIAL OF SOLAR- ON THE ROPES AND THAT WOULD COST THOSE RATEPAYERS WE ESTIMATE. ABOUT TWENTY CENTS PER MONTH- FOR IT TO SUPPORT YOUR TO CHARGE AND WE FEEL IT'S AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO SPREAD THOSE COSTS OUT OVER ALL THE- UTILITY RATEPAYERS. AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE PROPOSE THAT WE BELIEVE IT WILL GENERATE. ABOUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. SO BASICALLY THE YOUR THE SURCHARGE ON THE SO AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHICH DID IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN GENERATION. WILL A LOT OF FOLKS ARE TRYING TO GET OFF THE GRID BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THEREFORE AND THEY'RE IN THEIR GOING GREEN. AND NOW WE'RE BASICALLY ACTUALLY THERE THERE'S GONNA BE MORE THAN THE THAN THE- COMMERCIAL GENERATION EASY SO SIXTEEN CENTS FOR. SOMEBODY WHO IS IF IT IS I GUESS IN FRONT OF THE METER AND THOSE BEHIND THE METER ARE GONNA BE TWENTY CENTS. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT OUR PROPOSAL IS HOW DO THAT JUSTIFICATION. WELL THIS WOULDN'T APPLY TO ANYBODY WHOSE OFF THE GRID SO TO YOUR POINT IF SOMEONE WERE TO HAVE SOLAR AND NOT BE CONNECTED TO THE GRID THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE CHARGED WITH THIS CHARGED FLOWS FROM THE BENEFITS WE ALL ENJOY THOSE OF US WHO ARE CONNECTED TO THE GRID- ENJOY FROM FROM HAVING THAT IN OUR ACTIVITIES ARE ALL DESIGNED. TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE GRANT AND- ALL THE OTHER BENEFITS WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE FOR CALIFORNIA. SO BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT SO IF YOU'RE I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO IS HAS SOLAR WHO STILL CONNECTED TO THE GRID ONE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK WHEN THE SUN IS NOT SHINING AND- BUT- BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE PENALIZING THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY PUT. SOLAR ON. OR AS BUILT WITH SOLAR- THERE'S JUST TWENTY CENTS AND SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE THAT IS GOING TO BE SIXTEEN SAYS WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION AND THAT. WELL WE FIGURED THAT. THIS WAS THE IT WAS A COMPARABLE RATE IT WAS CLOSE- AND WE THAT THIS IS THIS IS BEEN A BENEFI THAT THOSE WHO HAVE HAD- SOLAR ON THEIR ROOFS AND NOT PAID- FOR. AND SO WE THOUGHT THAT WAS- AND I GREW EQUITABLE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. STILL WAITING FOR THE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE ON THAT AND THE- THE ANTICIPATED TWO THIRDS VOTE THAT WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THAT A CHANGE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PATROLS WITH WE HAVE A SMORGASBORD BOARD OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHY DON'T WE- HAVE THE PRESENTATION. PARTITION NUMBER FIVE. ALL RIGHTS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR I'LL JUMP RIGHT IN HERE SIGNED TYSON ACCURATELY ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MARKET DEVELOPMENT THAT GO B. AS GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT THIS PROPOSAL I THINK YOU KNOW WE PRESENT IN THE PAST ABOUT THE STEP MARKET DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR YOUR GO TO MARKET STRATEGY IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S REALLY THAT'S RIGHT HE'S REALLY FOCUSED ON. EQUITY AND SCALE I THINK THIS OCT THIS BUDGET REALLY PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO BOTH RIGHT SO IT'S THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS YOUR COMMISSIONER MONAHAN GIVES A GOOD OVERVIEW SOME OF THE NUMBERS IT'LL HELP DELIVERS AT OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED DRAYAGE TRUCKS THOUSAND TRANSIT BUSES A THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES BLESSED I'M MARKET ENABLING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN MANUFACTURING MAKE SURE THAT-WE'RE BUILDING THE MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO INVESTMENTS AND- LOW AND MODERATE INCOME ACCESS TO THE MARKET THROUGH THIS TV ARE BEING CLEAN CARS FOR ALL AND SO THE INVESTMENTS ALL OF THE HIT THE FOUR PILLARS OF THEM FADS THAT MARKET ELEMENT STRATEGY IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S ORGANIZED TO HELP THE END USERS ACCESS THE CAP MARKET CAPITAL AND IT'LL CREATE WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES AND SO YOU'LL HEAR FROM CARBON AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION BUT SEEN. RESOURCES BOARDS FOCUS ON A VEHICLE INVESTMENTS THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS FOCUSED ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BUT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON BRINGING THOSE TOGETHER TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ONE PROGRAM FOR THE END USER I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION- THE CHANGES FROM JANUARY- WE'VE DROPPED THE SECURITIZATION OF AB A PROPOSAL IN FAVOR OF THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION INVESTOR FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE FOUR TO FIFTEEN MILLION GOING INTO SUPPORT THAT THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND PROJECT THE TRADES TRANSIT SCHOOL BUSES FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'VE ADDED IN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN THE CONSUMER VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT UNIT FIFTY MILLION TO EXPAND CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. STATE WIDE. UNDER FIFTY MILLION. ADS IS AND SEVEN FACT- AND THEN FOR MILLION TO HELP RAISE. AWARENESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE UP MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET TO YES- BOTH IN THE FLEET SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE CONSUMER SIDE. AND SO THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE FOUR HANDED IT OFF TO- IS CARBON CITY BURGESS IS THAT. THEY WE STILL HAVE THE AB EIGHT RE AUTHORIZATION PROPOSAL AND THERE AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT TO KEEP THAT AND REALLY THAT'S DRIVING AFTER TO WORD THIS IT'S FOR MARKET SEARCH THAT MARKET CERTAINTY AND SO. THIS FIRST. YOU KNOW- BIG INVESTMENT FROM AT A THREE POINT TWO BILLION THAT'S REALLY THAT EARLY MARKET LET'S GET THIS THING KICKSTARTED. IN AB EIGHT EXTENSION IS TO KEEP. THE MOMENTUM GOING THROUGH TIME AND THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW WITH THOSE TWO TOGETHER IT'S REALLY ABOUT ATTRACTING PRIVATE CAPITAL THE PRIVATE CAPITAL WE NEED REALLY JUST GET THE FEELING THAT THAT HAVE PERCENT TARGETS THAT WE'RE- ALL FAMILIAR WITH FROM THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IN SEPTEMBER. AND SO WITH THAT WOULD BE HANDED OVER TO SENIOR BURGESS AND THEN WE'LL G TO. AN END AT AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AFTER THAT SAYS. SAID KEROBOKAN. SURE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SYDNEY BURKE. AND I A DIVISION CHIEF AT THE- AIR RESOURCE BOARD. SO IN THE MAY REVISE ON THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE SIDE WHAT YOU REALLY SEE IS A RECOGNITION THAT ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES ARE BECOMING WIDELY AVAILABLE AND THE LIGHT. MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. WHICH CAN OFFER A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT CAN OFFER HEALTH BENEFITS TO OUR COMMUNITY IS. IT CAN PROVIDE CONTINUES SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIA'S ZERO EMISSION ECONOMY THAT'S LEADING AND EXPANDING WITH ME HE'S OUR COMPONENTS BEING CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE EXPORT. AND WHAT YOU ALSO SEE IS A RECOGNITION THAT NOW IS REALLY THE TIME TO BE DOUBLING DOWN ON SUPPORTING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION OPTIONS FOR PRIORITY COMMUNITIES. SO SPECIFICALLY ME ROCK MAY REVISE PROPOSAL YOU SEE DOLLARS- A LIGHT DUTY SIDE- TOWARDS EXPANDING THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAMS STATEWIDE. EARLY THAT PROGRAM IS ONLY ADMINISTERED AND LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY SO BAY AREA SAN JOAQUIN SOUTH COAST IN SACRAMENTO. BUT THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION MOBILITY OPTIONS. SHOULD BE AVAILABLE STATE WINE. I'M SENIOR HE- IN THE MAY REVISE THERE IS FOR HUNDRED AND DOLLAR A BIRTH YEARS A FOCUS ON LOW AND MEDIUM INCOME VEHICLE FIRES. AND THE HAVE YOU DECIDE THE MAIN REVISED INCLUDES EXPANDED RESOURCES TO PUT OVER A THOUSAND DRAINAGE TRUCKS AT THOUSAND TRANSIT BUSES AND THE THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES THEIR MISSION. FOCUSED ON ROLL ON CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. SO THE MAIN REVISED SPECIFICALLY WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES TO ADOPT ZERO MISSION BY JETS AND AS I'M SURE YOU ARE ALL AWARE. I TRANSIT AGENCIES BUDGETS HAVE BEEN HACKED ARTICULATE HARD BIKE HOLDEN- AND ALSO DUE TO THE STRONG PRESENCE OF- JUNCTION BOX MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA THIS ENHANCED INVESTMENT. IN ZERO EMISSION BUSES WILL ALSO DELIVER. ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE STATE. WITH RESPECT IS BUSES. THANK SAYS REQUIRES WERE ON THIS AND MUCH MUCH HAS BEEN DONE BUT ALSO MUCH REMAINS FOR US TO DO. THERE'S OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES IN THE STATE AND ONLY ABOUT 1% OF THEM ARE ZERO MISSION. SO THIS BUDGET WOULD REALLY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTICULARLY ROLES BALLISTICS COLLECT TRACK. I'M IN THE DROEGE STINKS WITH THE IMPENDING TRUCK COMBUST TURNOVER REQUIREMENTS EIGHT THOUSAND RIDGE TRUCKS WILL BE REQUIRED TO TURN OVER BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT'S PARTICULARLY TIMELY TO MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO HELP SMALL FLEETS AND INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATORS GET INTO ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS- AS TYSON MENTIONED THIS FUNDING WOULD OCCURRING CLOSE COORDINATION WITH CDC GOMEZ AND YOU TO ENSURE THAT OUR VEHICLE- DEPLOYMENT INVESTMENTS. REALLY DOVE TAIL WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- EMISSIONS INVESTMENTS- IN ZERO EMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WITHOUT I WILL TURN THIS OVER TO CC. IN ORDER. HI GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS HANNAH RUSSELL ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FUEL THE TRANSPORTATION DIVISION AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THE FEW KEY PORTIONS OF THE PACKAGE. THIS PROPOSAL REALLY PRESENT EXCITING AND UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO SOLIDIFY CALIFORNIA AS A LEADER IN THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS. I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE RESORT THE BOARD CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY CONNECTION GO BAD DEPARTMENT. OF FINANCE. TO NAME JUST A FEW. BUT ALSO LIKE KNOW THAT THIS FURTHER A LOT OF CALIFORNIA IMPORTANT GOAL. THIS INCLUDES PUBLIC HEALTH THE CLEAN AIR ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONVERT HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE. WOULD BE TO SUPPORT ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF INCOME LEVEL. TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND OFFERED TO ACT OF THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS CREATING JOCKEY MANUFACTURING. THANK YOU NOTE THEIR JOB IN THE FUTURE AND LOCAL JOB IN ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION. I WAS ALREADY MENTIONED CDC IS A LEAD FOR THAT PURPOSE RECORD THE STATE AND WE HAVE A REALLY STRONG INTEREST IN GRIDLOCK THE LIABILITY AND RESILIENT AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ANYTHING TO CONNECT TO THE GRID IS A GOOD. NUMBER GRAD AND SO NEARLY 80% OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION PROPOSED FUNDING FOR THIS EVENT THE TRUCKER PACKAGE GOES TOWARD- INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS IS BOTH ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HIGHER EDUCATION. THE WHEN WE TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IMPACT WILL. THE WE'RE PROPOSING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS A BROAD INVESTMENT AND YOU CAN REALLY I'M NOT IN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO PORTIONS. ONE PORTION BEING THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CLOSE THE LIGHT DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE GOT FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND AGAIN I WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE BOTH ON THE ELECTRIFIED THE ENTIRE INSIDE OPERA POPULAR VEHICLE. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE GOOD FOR STRUCTURE THE POPULAR VEHICLE. SO THE PORTIONS OUT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO THE COURT AND DEPRESSED COULD TRANSITION FOR MEDIUM. DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCK ABOUT THE- THIS INCLUDES BROUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE. INTEREST TO FOR DELIVERY TO. BOB TRUCKS GOOD MOVEMENT. OR VEHICLE. THE RANGERS AND THE HD VEHICLE AND AGAIN SUPPORT BOTH ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN. BUT NOTHING NOTHING- IT'S FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE THAT THE DIMENSION THE OVER THOUSAND GRADES TRUCK. ONE THOUSAND TRANSIT BUSES ONE THOUSAND GOLD BUT THE SUPPORTING BOTH ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN AND WILL WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CARD ISSUE ROLL THIS OUT THANK YOU COMMISSION WILL UTILIZE THEIR ENERGIZED PROJECT. AND PARTNER WITH CARDS H. THE PROJECT AND TO GO HAND. IN HAND TO MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER. THE LAST OF THAT- AND YOU HUNDRED FIFTH MILLION. WHICH IS FOCUSED ON THAT. AND I RELATED MANUFACTURING. I WANT NOTED ENERGY COMMISSION HAD A LONG HISTORY IN MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT. WE'VE INVESTED APPROXIMATELY FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON TWENTY SIX PROJECT. AND THIS IS A STATE- COMPANIES LIKE PROTERRA CHARGE POINT. ZERO MOTORCYCLES AND TRANSPOWER. YOU SHOULD BE INVESTMENT BY THE FEET HE HAD RESULT IN MATCH FUNDING IN EXCESS OF ONE DOLLAR ONE DOLLAR BUT WE PUT IN. TEN MILLION DOLLARS THEY'RE PUTTING IN MORE THAN THAT THIS IS REALLY TRACK PRIVATE FIND THE CALIFORNIA. WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA COULD BE THE NEW MICHIGAN ONE COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE. WE ALREADY HAVE OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND JOBS. AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY COMPANIES BUSINESSES AND MANUFACTURERS. IN THE STATE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE MANUFACTURING COME TO CALIFORNIA. AND WE WANT TO HELP. PROMISING NEW COMPANIES GROW. A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT GREAT. AB OFFENSE THE TYPE SANCTIONS. WE ORIGINALLY OUT THANK YOU TO FORTY. WE ARE NOW ASKING FOR A SHOW THANK AND I JUST THIRTY FIVE. WE'RE NO ONGER REQUESTING BONTA FORTY AND WE'RE NO LONGER REQUEST TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO EXTEND EIGHTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE RELIABLE PREDICTABLE FUNDING FOR BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT. RELATABILITY THE SPECIALLY IMPORTANT REPLACEMENT BENEFITS THAT RETIREMENT CYCLE AND PEOPLE RETIREMENT SCUTTLED WE WANT TO PROVIDE A CLEAR PATH DOWN TO CONVERT OVER TIME THIS ALSO BRINGS IN A LOT OF. TRYING TO FIND THE CAPITAL TO THE STATE YEAH I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY COMPETING WITH OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. FOR THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND IF WE DON'T MAKE THE INVESTMENT WE SHOW THAT A LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO WHAT WE COULD LOSE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES- WITHOUT OKAY GOOD MY REMARKS AND- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. HI SIR I RECOGNIZE. WE IT HE L. L. WE'VE GOT THE UNDER COMMISSION WITH FOR THE L. A. AND YOU CALL MAY. THEY'VE GOT. CLOSE COORDINATION BETWEEN KOBE IS IN THE AIRPORT AND ENERGY COMMISSION AND CPUC. ITS FINGER LAW. WHAT ARE YOUR COMMENTS ON THIS. SPLIT BETWEEN HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CARBON CC IN THIS SORT OF THE TRADE OFFS AND IS IN THE PROPOSAL. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SO AS YOU HEARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING BILLION I'M PRESSED PRESIDENT AN INCREASE IN SPENDING FOR IS OUT OF PROGRAMS AND SO. ON THIS COMMITTEE ASSIGNED A COUPLE HEARINGS RECENTLY ON THIS TOPIC SO I WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT MONIES AS IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH VARIOUS STATE KLEINER QUALITY GOALS ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS TRANSPORTATION AS A AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF THOSE EMISSIONS. HOWEVER BEFORE APPROVING ALL OR SOME OF THIS PACKAGE WOULD MAKE THE LEGISLATURE ONE I'M SURE THE PACKAGE IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS KIND OF BROADER FINER QUALITY STRATEGIES AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT THERE IS AN ADEQUATE PROCESS IN PLACE TO EVALUATE PROGRAM OUTCOMES SO MY PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ONSOME OF THOSE COMMENTS AND I. AND A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS SO WHEN HIGHLIGHT I REALLY FOUR G. QUESTIONS BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY REVIEW. FIRST IS ARE THE PROPOSED SPENDING CATEGORIES AND PROGRAM DESIGNS CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE- THIS PACKAGE I'M NOT A MONEY WOULD GO TO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS THAT'S ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION COMPARED TO LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS WHICH WOULD GET ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION. SO ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH FOR HEAVY DUTY ALSO THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR CVR P. WOULD- GO TO ENTIRELY TO THE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME PORTION OF THE PROGRAM. OUR ELIGIBILITY IS ONLY UP 24100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO THAT'S A YOU CAN CHANGE FROM KIND OF THE BROADER CTRP PROGRAM AND- IS A MUCH LOWER INCOME CUTS FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE REBATES. THE LEGISLATURE WE JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT THOSE SPENDING ALLOCATIONS AND PROGRAM DESIGNS ALIGN WITH ITS PRIORITIES HOWEVER MUCH MONEY IT ENDS UP- ALLOCATING. I SECONDS HOW WILL THE PROGRAMS BE EVALUATED- AS NOTED IN PRIOR REPORTS MORE OFFICE AND OTHERS THERE IS LIMITED RELIABLE INFORMATION ON THE RELATIVE COST EFFECTIVENESS ORANGE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT TRANSPORTATION EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. THE LEGISLATURE WARRANTED CONSIDER MAYBE REQUIRING. THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A PLAN. ACTING CONSUL WITH OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS TACKLE THE NEST DATA. AND EVALUATE OUR OF THE PRO BOTH THE FUN OF THE WAR- WHICH COULD ENSURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO. OF WHAT'S THE- AND FUTURE YEARS ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THIS. OF WORKING WELL AND WHAT ISN'T. THIRD- SHOULD THE FUND FOR THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS BOTH VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE BE SPLIT BETWEEN CARBON CC HEARD THAT- THE PROPOSAL WOULD INCLUDE FUNDING FOR- BOTH OF THOSE AGENCIES WHEN IT COMES TO- DRAYAGE TRUCKS. TRANSIT BUSES AND SCHOOL BUSES SO CC WILL GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE PORTION OF THAT FUNDING AND CAR WOULD GET THE- FUNDING FOR THE VEHICLES- AND SWELL THIS. HAS TRADITIONALLY SORT OF BEEN THE SPLIT ON THE LIGHT DUTY SIDE OF THINGS WERE CARD GETS THE FUNDING FOR VEHICLES ENERGY COMMISSION GETS INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING- WITHIN SORT OF THE RATIONALE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE HEAVY DUTY SIDE OF THINGS WHERE. A LOT OF CASES- IT'S INITIALLY IS ADOPTING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY. THEY ARE PUTTING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADOPTING THE VEHICLES AT THE SAME TIME AND SO THERE'S- OF THE FUNDING WILL BE COMING OUT ABOUT THE SAME TIME TO THE SAME ENTITIES AND SO- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT IT CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE TO KIND OF HAVE THAT FUNDING. AND THE PROGRAMMATIC ADMINISTRATION SEPARATE BETWEEN A. R. B. AND ENERGY COMMISSION- BECAUSE IT COULD CREATE POTENTIAL. ISSUES AROUND COORDINATION AND ACCESS TO MINISTRY OF COSTS SO. THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT GOING FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL. AND THEN FINALLY THE FOURTH QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN RAISED A COUPLE TIMES THE EXTENSION OF AB EIGHT CITIES WHICH IS. STILL PART OF THE PROPOSAL- SINCE THE- CURRENT PROPOSAL THE MAYOR VISION DOESN'T CONTINUE THE- PROPOSED SECURITIZATION OF THOSE AB EIGHT. AND THE FEES DON'T SUNSET UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- THE EXTENSION OF THOSE FEES ISN'T REALLY NECESSARY TO AN AXE. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PACKAGE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING. AS OF THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO DEFER ACTION ON THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE PROPOSAL JUST TO ENSURE THAT HAS. SUFFICIENT TIME TO WEIGH THE MERITS OF THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF ONE OF ITS BROADER. OVERALL TRANSPORTATION EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGY. BUT SO I WILL IN MY COMMENTS THERE HAVE ANSWERING QUESTIONS DON'T YOU INTERPRET THIS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S NOT HAVING CONTINUOUS FUNDING ON THE PROGRAM SORT. OF A PROPER AS WE THE LEGISLATURE THAT WILL WE CAN. THE FOR. HOW WE SPEND IT IS GOING TO BE SET UP BY FUTURE LEDGE. LEGISLATURE THERE THERE- AND THAT'S IT THAT'S A- SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OR IS IT NOT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK- YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S- ADAM WAS WITH US WE TALKED ABOUT ON KIND OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT THE STUFF BEFORE THERE'S- THERE'S GONNA RATIONALE TO KIND OF TAKE EXTEND THE SEASON THE PROGRAMS TO KIND OF PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE I THINK AND- AND DIFFERENT KIND OF FUNNY DIFFERENT AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS THERE ARE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT BEST MAKES A PROGRAM SHOULD BE GOING FORWARD- AND SO YOU KNOW THE THAT YOU KNOW IT MADE VERY WELL BE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SORT OF THE SITES YES WE DO WANT SORT OF THAT- THAT FUNDING STREAM TO EXTEND GOING FORWARD I THINK. THE MAIN ISSUE ON THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF IT IS JUST IT TURNED OUT THAT THE EXTENSION I'M NOT DECISION DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW IN PARTICULAR TO KIND OF ABOUT THIS THIS PACKAGE BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE SORTS USE THAT AS A VALUABLE FUNDING STREAM GOING FORWARD AND- CLEARLY THAT'S KINDOF WITHIN. A WITHIN ITS PURVIEW TO IT TO EXTEND THAT FUNDING AND WORK OUT EXACTLY. HOW IT'S HOW IT'S BEEN GOING FORWARD. WELL I THINK CHECK BENNY SAID TIMING IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT. AS ME LEFT WITH THAT- OKAY. SENATOR DOLLY HAS THE QUESTIONS. I'VE BEEN OVER DESERVE PROGRAM. THANKS THANK YOU FOR THE- DISCUSSIONS WE WILL HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OFFLINE- OBVIOUSLY IS THE SENATOR WHO AS TESLA AND THEIR DEATH THEIR DISTRICT I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM IT'LL HAVE A ROBUST AND SEVENTY OR 80% OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD AND THEY THAT THEY WOULD BE A ROBUST PORTION OF THE- THE PROGRAMS THERE AND OBVIOUSLY THE ERROR BOARD. KNOWS WHAT'S ON MY FEELINGS ON THE OTHER PART OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM SO CENTER DALI DOESN'T WHAT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT I KNOW THAT. I AM IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS AND I'VE BEEN- REVIEWING LIKE WHAT'S AVAILABLE FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND THERE IT IS TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE ISN'T- ELECTRIC VEHICLE AVAILABLE. AND SO WERE YOU KNOW GRADUALLY MOVING TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AT A- FASTER RATE IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- THE NOT ON THE BUS ON THE BUS AND- IN TRANSIT SIDE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE THAT THAT'S WHAT THOSE REPUBLIC AGES BUT THE PRIVATE FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING AROUND THE DOCKS AND- THE LIKES OF AND HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO CHANGE OUT THERE- VEHICLES TO MEET THE STANDARD THAT WE HAVE TODAY- WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE- PROCESS LOOK LIKE FOR THEM THAT IF THEY'VE HAD JUST MADE THIS INVESTMENT. AND THEN WERE PUSHING THEM TOWARDS- YOU KNOW SO AS AS HAVE A WEEK HOW THE AND THE THOSE ARE THESE ARE OWNER OPERATORS A LOT OF THEM HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE THAT CHANGE AND WHAT WHAT'S THE- INCENTIVE FOR. MANAGED THEY JUST MADE A CHANGE ARE PROBABLY HAVE PAYMENTS. FOR SOMETIME ALLOTTEES OR VERY SHORT DISTANCE THEY MOVE MATERIALS VERY SHORT DISTANCE OTHER THE- THEIR QUICKNESS LAST A LONG TIME. CHERYL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- AND REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR IN DEPTH INVOLVEMENT IN THE STATUS SO I'LL JUST START BY SAYING THAT IN TERMS OF THIS YOUR MISSION AVAILABILITY FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS THAT REALLY HAS EXPANDED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OVER SIX MAJOR OEMS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE IN PRODUCTION OR WILL BE IN PRODUCTION BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS- A PART OF THE OVERALL IS PORTFOLIO HERE IS ALSO THAT ACCORDING TO THE DANCE CLEAN TRUCK REGULATION ABOUT THE CARDBOARD RECENTLY ADOPTED THAT TRUCK MANUFACTURERS INORDER TO BE ABLE TO SELL IN CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO BE BRINGING ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS TO MARKET STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WITH ESCALATING PERCENTAGES FROM THEIR- IN TERMS OF HELPING OUT YOU KNOW THE SMALL INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATORS ARE SMALL FLEETS YOU DISCUSS I REALLY THINK THAT THE MAIN REVISED. IS REALLY INTENDED TO HELP SUPPORT- THE TURNOVER TWO ZERO MISSION PARTICULARLY TARGETED. AT THOSE PLEASE THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TO HELP THEM GET INTO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS AND HELP MAKE THAT UP FRONT INVESTMENTS- CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE EIGHT THOUSAND THREE TRUCKS THAT ARE TURNING OVER AT THE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HELPING THEM GET JUST YOUR IMMERSION TRUCKS. ARTICULATED HEAD OF ANY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MIGHT BE COMING. TO BE CONTINUED THANK YOU EVERYONE THIS WILL CONCLUDE PART AA ARE BECAUSE WE HAVE ANOTHER FOR BRINGING A GENDER.

IS ON THE FARM AND WHAT KEEPS US PROACTIVE IN A CHANGING CLIMATE SO OUR FIRST OUR FIRST CATEGORY OF FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED NAY REVISED HER AROUND CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENCY. FOR THESE ARE OUR ON GOING CLIMATE SMART AG PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO TWO PROGRAMS AT OUR HOUSE AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD THAT I WILL ALSO TOUCH ON. THE TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND BUDGET YEAR AND THE BREAKDOWN IS AS FOLLOWS- THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED AN INCREASED INVESTMENT FAN ARE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. WHICH IS WHICH IS ONE THAT PROVIDES A MULTITUDE OF BENEFITS INCLUDING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR SOILS OVER THE LONG TERM THE ABILITY TO DRIVE DOWN CARBON AND STORED IN OUR SOILS CLASS ALL ORGANIC MATTER THAT INCREASES BIODIVERSITY ACTIVITY AS WELL AS NUTRIENT CYCLING AND VERY IMPORTANTLY WATER HOLDING CAPACITY THE PROPOSAL IS FOR. SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FINAL CHANGE INVESTMENT FUND- THE PROPOSAL FOR MAY REVISED INCLUDES SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR LIVESTOCK METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAMS THESE HAVE BEEN HOUSED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE THE JERRY SECTOR IN PARTICULAR THAT FAMILIES HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP INTO THIS SPACE. TO LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ESPECIALLY NOTHING DUCTION WHICH IS JUST CERTAINLY HAVE CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. THE PROPOSAL FOR SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN OUR DAILY DIGESTS YOUR PROGRAM WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT. PROGRESS ON THE MANDATE. TO REDUCE METHANE REDUCTION WITH THESE TWO- THE NEW YORK. THAT'S BEEN. IS THIRTY NINE DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR PUBLIC HAVE PROGRAM. WE ENVISION THIS IS TO ALLEN TO ONE WOULD BE DIRECT CENTER GRANTS TO INDIVIDUAL FARMERS TO CREATE FORAGE AND HABITAT FOR POLLINATORS. SOME OF THESE PRACTICES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM HAVE ACROSS AND HAD SHOWS FOR TWO EXAMPLES OF THAT. BUT WE ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED WITH THE LAUNCH OF A NEW CALIFORNIA POLLINATOR COALITION LAST MONTH REALLY LOOKING AT MORE AT LANDSCAPE SCALE PROJECTS ON A REGIONAL BASIS. BUT WHAT HAPPENED NUMBER OF LANDOWNERS INVOLVED. TO BE ABLE TO AND- A CREATE THAT CONTINUOUS HABITAT AND FORAGE FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR OUR NAY DEEP AS WELL AS- IMPORTED- BEES AND OTHER- O POLLINATORS WHICH INCLUDE MONARCH BUTTERFLIES BATS AND BIRDS- THAT'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. I KNEW OUR PROGRAM BUT ONE HAS BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION BAYERN BAYERN MENTAL FARMING SCIENCE HEALTH FOR THE PAST YEAR. YES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PARTNER WITH ROWERS TO CREATE CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PLANS THIS CAN BE A WHOLE FARM CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PLAN TO TAKE IN A VARIETY OF PRACTICES INCLUDING. I PM THEIR ADDITION MANAGEMENT WILDLIFE CORRIDORS WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE THESE ARE PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS THAT CAN COST AS MUCH AS TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO DEVELOP THEM THEY ALSO WILL LEVERAGE THAT FARMER TO BE ABLE TO POTENTIALLY HAPPY AND TWO NRCS DOLLARS IN THE. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. OR A BETTER SENSE OF HOW TO. WHICH ONE OF OUR PROGRAM THING TO DO TOO WE DO GREENHOUSE GAS AND- INCLUDED IN THESE WOULD BE TRANSITION TO ORGANIC. PLANS OF IT TAKES A THREE YEAR PROCESS IT'S A PRETTY BIG INVESTMENT TO DECIDE YOU WANT TO GO THIS WAY AND HAVING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO CREATE THESE PLANS. IS A FARMER A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT KINDS OF RISKS THAT MIGHT BE TAKING ON AND SHARING% THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING THAT PLAN. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT FUNDING CARBON FARM PROGRAMS- ON THE FAR THE TO AIRPORT PROGRAMS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL. IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND- TO SUPPORT THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- TO REDUCE AND PHASE OUT OPEN AGRICULTURAL BURNING THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN PRACTICE. THAT IS FACING THE INDUSTRY BUT THE BASE OUT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. AND THE LAST ONE IS ONGOING INVESTMENT IN THE FARMER PROGRAM WHICH IS ENGINE REPLACEMENT AND EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT PROGRAM TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND TO REDUCE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. THIS IS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR. TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR DISTRICT. BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE. COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL CLEAN ACT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CLIMATE CHANGE INVESTMENT FUND AT FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND. AT FOUR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GREENHOUSE. NO FROM THE GENERAL FUND I MISSPOKE I'M BACK. THE SECOND CATEGORY IS REALLY CONNECTING THE PRODUCTIVITY THAT WE DO ON THE FARM. TO HOW WE PUT THAT INTO THE CHANNELS OF TRADE TO REACH EVERY CONSUMER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHY RESILIENT AND EQUITABLE FOOD SYSTEMS. OBVIOUSLY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE A NUMBER OF DISRUPTIONS FOR THE SHUT DOWN OF THE ECONOMY THE LOTS OF FREE SERVICE THE CREATIVENESS OF THE FARM COMMUNITY AND DOING MORE ONLINE. PLATFORMS TO REACH CONSUMERS DIRECTLY. AND ONE OF OUR NEWER PROGRAMS THAT LAUNCHED LAST YEAR AS A FORM SCHOOL PROGRAMS. REALLY THINKING THROUGH HOW DO WE REACH THOSE HARD TO REACH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOOD AND SECURE OR NOT GETTING THE KINDS OF NUTRITION THAT THEY MAKE. AS WELL AS SUPPORTING MORE LOCALLY FROM CALIFORNIA PRODUCED FROM GERMAN SO THAT WE'RE CREATING LOCAL ECONOMIES AT SCALE AND REGIONAL BASIS- THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSES INCREASING THE INVESTMENT. IN THE INCUBATOR PROGRAM FOR FARM TO SCHOOL BY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS WOULD INCLUDE. NOT ONLY INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY TO GRANT FUNDS THAT WE HAVE A PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN BEST TO DO A THREE YEAR EVALUATION. YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS BEST AND FOR REALLY GETTING OUTCOMES THAT WE PROPOSE IN OUR GRANT PROGRAMS. IT INCLUDES TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR IMPROVEMENT AGRICULTURE GRANT PROGRAMS. THIS IS TO REALLY ASSESS THE INCREASING NUMBER OF URBAN FARMS AND LARGE SCALE. COMMUNITY GARDENS THAT ARE BEING CONVERTED INTO FARMS TO CREATE MORE ACCESS BUT THOSE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AFTER TIME OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REALLY DEPENDED ON HAVING THAT KIND OF ACCESS TO FRESH AND LOCALLY GROWN PRODUCE. UP AND JUST REALLY REVITALIZING. URBAN FARM SYSTEMS. I CAN. OF OUR- NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THIS IS ONE THAT THEY ON THE- THAT WERE DONE IN THE CHIU YEARS THAT DONE THIS. REALLY UNDER HOW WE BEST REACH LOW INCOME SHOPPERS TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS LOCALLY FRESH PRODUCE CALIFORNIA PRODUCED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND GENERAL FUND FOR THAT PROGRAM.

WE PROPOSE TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM TO SERVE NEW TYPESCRIPT GRANTEES INCLUDING FOOD BANKS AND FOOD DONATION PROGRAMS IN ADDITION TO CORNER STORES AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND WHAT WE CHARACTERIZE AS FOOD DESERT COMMUNITIES. IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON SUPPORTING FOOD BANKS AND THEIR DONATION PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. OVER THE YEARS TO INCREASE OPERATING IN THOSE FAMILY FOOD BOXES TO AND TO INCLUDE MORE FRESH PRODUCE. BUT WITH THE SURGE OF A 73% INCREASE IN NEED. THROUGH FOOD BANKS FOR FAMILIES THAT FOUND THEMSELVES SUDDENLY UNEMPLOYED THEY NEED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE NUTRITION OF THOSE BOXES. AND LAST A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS AND TO LEVERAGE A SENIOR FARMERS MARKET NUTRITION PROGRAM. WITH SO MANY SENIORS WHO DURING CLOUT PORTANTINO. NOT ABLE TO.

AND INCLUSIVE EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS A FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL INCLUDES THREE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THE FRESNO MERCED FUTURE OF FOOD INNOVATION INITIATIVE. THIS WAS ACTUALLY PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY JANUARY BUDGET. AND THEN WITH THE CHANGE IN OUR REVENUE SITUATION WAS ELIMINATED AT THAT TIME. THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO DO THEIR STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR THEIR OUT REACH AND THEIR PLANS DEVELOPMENT THIS IS ABOUT CAPITALIZING ON AGRICULTURE AND THE SPECIALTY CROP THAT WE HAVE IN THE DIVERSITY OF PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE. OF BEING ABLE TO FOCUS ON WATER IN DROUGHT MANAGEMENT REALLY CREATING INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY CENTERS THE PROGRAM IT PROGRAMMING JOBS THAT GO WITH THAT AND REALLY IMPROVING AND ENHANCING THE INTELLECTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE BETWEEN YOU SEE MORE SAD. THE ISSUE FRESNO AND OTHER CAMPUSES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO REALLY IMPROVE THE DIVERSITY OF THE ECONOMY AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BY A FOCUS ON AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION.

TO REALLY ENCOURAGE AND INCENTIVIZE MORE LOCAL RESILIENCY PLANNING AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE EQUIPPED FOR SAFE EVACUATION CENTERS MERGES THE RESPONSE CENTERS OF FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEN THINKING ABOUT THE FLIPPING FUSSED EXCEPT THE FACILITIES FOR LONGER TERM SOCIETAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS WITHIN THE- COUNTIES- AND THEN THE LAST PROGRAM I DID WANT TO MENTION. MISTER CHAIRS ARE SUSTAINABLE CALIFORNIA. GROWN CANNABIS PILOT PROGRAM. THE LEGAL I'M INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ONE TO PARTICIPATE IN A NUMBER OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE DATA ON THE GROWING PRACTICES BE ABLE TO SET BENCHMARKS AND THEN CREATED SENT TO PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THAT.

MAY REVISION BUDGET REALLY PROPOSES THE GIGANTIC INVESTMENT IN AN EQUITABLE COBB AND YOU CHILL TOMORROW- AND IF YOU HAD FROM SECRETARY ROSS AND WE'LL HEAR FROM SECOND YOU CREDIT FOR THE MOMENT. THIS IS AN ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT ALL OF GOVERNMENT COORDINATED BUDGET AND APPROACH TO TACKLING CLIMATE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND SO AS WE WILL THAT. DECIDING THAT- MAY REVISION AS IT RELATES TO CLIMATE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WE LOOK AT THREE CORE PRINCIPLES JUST HELP CONTEXTUALIZE THAT HEALTH THAT COULD BE AND JOBS. WE ALSO LOOK FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT OUT DOLLARS WE GET FED THAT WHETHER THAT'S ONE ELECTRIFYING SCHOOL BUSES FOR REBUILDING DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE SAYS. JUMPING RIGHT IN I'M IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR POPE FOR THE BUDGET KELLY P. A. AT JUST THE VOCAL POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND NEARLY NINE BILLION DOLLARS THE MAYOR VISIONS ALMOST TWICE THAT MARKED THE SINGLE BIGGEST ENVIRONMENTAL BUDGET AND- STATE'S HISTORY. AND IMPORTANTLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE BUDGET RAISES ALL BOATS TOGETHER AS THE RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC AND RIGHTS TO MEET THE CHALLENGES INCLINED THAT IN THE STATE. THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISED TARGETS 60% OR MORE OF ITS OVERALL FUNDING TO DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ACROSS. THE STATE. OF THE OVERWHELMINGLY. OF COLOR.

THE GROUND OPPORTUNITIES TO COUNTY DA'S BY MENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS. TO HELP BUILD LOCAL CAPACITY GIVE ME J.

WATER AND WASTEWATER INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU HAD EARLY THIS MORNING FROM COBB THE C. GO THE ABOUT THEIR- LIKE TO BELIEVE BULLS DATEABLE. AND EQUITABLE TO. SYSTEM BY CREATING A AND- THIS IS CENTRO TO OUR MAY READ. AND CHECK OF FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF OUR DISCUSSIONS LAST WEEK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE PROJECTS. THAT WE ARE INVESTING AND- THEY REALLY RELATE TO THIS TWAIN GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND REDUCING CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND THERE'S NO BETTER WAY THAN DOING THAT AND THIS GOES THE L. A. AS COMMENTS- THEN FOCUSING ON HEAVY DUTY- AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS A BALANCE BETWEEN- BUT AND RURAL. SO THE SCHOOL BUSES THE FALCONS THEIR MISSION SCHOOL BUSES IT BECAUSE IT'S ON THE RURAL COMMUNITY- THE TRANSIT BUSES ALL OVER THE STATE AND THE DRAINAGE TRACKS- PARTICULARLY- REPORTS GOING TO WAREHOUSING. I DID WANT TO SAY ONE FIVE US EVERYTHING I THINK WAS COVERED IN THE LAST PRESENTATIONS BUT THAT WAS THERE. A QUESTION ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT- WHICH IS RE AUTHORIZATION OF A FUNDING I'LL LOVE THAT FUNDING GOES TO ADD DISTRICTS AND OTHERS FOR THE CABALLERO PROGRAM. THAT IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MEET OUR STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT AS YOU KNOW SEVEN OF THE TEN WEST THAT SHEDS IN THAT COUNTRY- UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA- WE RELY ON THE CREDIT WE GET. UNDER THE STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS FROM COMMONWEALTH FUNDING AND UNFORTUNATELY IF WE DON'T MEET THE TARGET SET OUT IN THOSE WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION- FUNDING. AB HAS UNITED THE CLEAN AIR ACT THE IS. A PENALTY FOR NOT ACHIEVING THE MILESTONES IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT WHICH IS REDUCING THOSE. AND POTENTIALLY LOSING FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS SAYS WE WOULD PLACE A LOT OF EMPHASIS- AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN YOUR CAR IMINT KERR ABOUT- WILLINGNESS WORK WITH LEGISLATURE- ON THAT ON THAT ISSUE RELATING APPROACH. WE NEED TO GET DONE IF YOU. I THING THAT WE NEED TO GET DONE YEAR WHICH YOU'VE BEEN H. ON AND THIS COMMITTEE. I JUST WANNA THANK YOU. IS THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL. PROPOSING AND- INSURING THE REFORMS OF THE POPULAR TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL WHICH ABOUT THE COUNT ABILITY AND- CHANGING THE FEE STRUCTURE.

AND AVAILABLE TO HARM FROM MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL BATONS BILLS HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET RELATING TO DGSE. TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS- AND TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE MAINTAINS WHICH IS PRETTY CRITICAL. POLITICIANS AND U. S. EPA DID MINISTER I REGRET THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT THE CALIFORNIA- THAT THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING IT. IS KIND OF CLASS THAT. THE CRITICAL THING THAT WE NEED TO DO. AND FINALLY AS IT RELATES TO DGFT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION. OVER TWO YEARS THAT COMBINED WITH THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE GOVERNOR'S JAN TEN BUDGET. BUT FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. TO HELP ACCELERATE CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES IMPACTED. COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE TIME I WILL WANTED TO TIE. THAT TO THE- FORMAL PASSAGE THE TO THE OF ON DUTY. RECALL OF THE SITE AND TRANSPARENT. AND THEN FINALLY THIS CAT OF CLEANING UP- COMMUNITY. PAUL XII- WHICH IS THAT I MADE TOPIC OF THE OAK COMMITTEE AND YOUR- COMMITTEE- MA'AM AT FOR NUMEROUS YEARS THAT MAYOR. PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE GENERAL FUND OVER THREE YEARS. THE CLEAN UP ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES- AND THAT- ADDITION OF THAT IS THAT BUILDS UPON TO JUST TO SAY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHANGE. THAT FREDDIE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION- IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND THAT WAS IN JANUARY THAT WENT FROM THIRTY ONE POINT FOUR TWO TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE MILLION AND TODAY. WE SPENT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION FOR RESIDENTIAL CLEAN UP AND OTHER ASSOCIATED COSTS EXCITED. AND THE MAY REVISION ALSO CONTAINS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION THE CONTINUE CLEANUP AT THE FORMER EXCITED FACILITY ITSELF. WHICH RESULTED FROM A FLAGRANT MANIPULATION OF BANKRUPTCY LAWS. THAT THE STATE IS STILL CHALLENGING. THE EXCITED AT THE AMOUNT OF MY THAT WE PAY TO SPEND- I THINK IS REALLY AN EXAMPLE OF WHY WE NEED TO REFORM AT THE YES THE- WHY WE NEED TO- THE INCREASE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE ALL. CHECKED BAGS DO NOT EVER HAPPEN AGAIN GET OUT STATE. I'M AND THEN BRINGING OUT THE CLOSE AS YOU TEED UP AT THE BEGINNING CHAD. I'M REALLY WANTS TO BEGIN SEARCHES FOR CONTINUE TO FOSTER INNOVATION- AND THINK ABOUT WAYS OF LOOKING AT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS TO FACE BAYERN MENTAL CHALLENGES FRONT.

THANK YOU AND- THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION- CONTINUING ON WITH OUR GENDER LET'S. MOVE TO SECRETARY CROWFOOT WITH THE- HI NATURI. AGENTS AND ALL THE SENTRY DEPART. UNDERNEATH THAT WERE PICKED UP ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE BEYOND IN OUR- AGENDA. WE GOT A LOT IN HERE SAID GO AHEAD. YEAH I THINK SO MUCH SURE BECAUSE THE MEMBERS OF THE- HAVE A DAUNTING TASK AND THAT IS OF COURSE DICKENS THIS RANGE OF INVESTMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSING. SO I'LL DO MY BEST TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD AND CONNECT THE DOTS ARE IN A FEW OF OUR KEY PRIORITY AREAS. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS BUILDING OUR CLIMATE RESILIENCE. WE'VE TALKED A LOT OF THIS HEARING ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS WE PROPOSE TO KEEP CALIFORNIA LEADING THE WORLD BUILDING OUR ECONOMY AND MOVING TOWARD CARBON NEUTRALITY. AND THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE RESILIENCE CRIME AN ADAPTATION IS NO LONGER A FUTURE PLANNING EXERCISE IT'S A MATTER OF PROTECTING OUR RESIDENTS AND OUR NATURAL PLACES RIGHT NOW. ARE WE KNOW THAT CLIMATE DRIVEN THREATS ARE GETTING MORE DESTRUCTIVE. THE LAST WILDFIRE SEASON PROVED AT THE RECORD BREAKING TEMPERATURES LAST SUMMER APPROVED AT. THAT PERNICIOUS DROUGHT WE'RE NOW IN THE- I EXPERIENCING PROVES THAT. AND SO- WHILE THESE ARE BIG SUMS OF MONEY I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY AND MAKE THE MAKE THE INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED TO. ACT TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS FROM THESE CLIMATE DRIVEN THREATS SO I'LL OUTLINE OUR INVESTMENT IN FIVE TO. FIVE SPECIFIC THREATS THAT ARE THAT ARE WORSENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE WILDFIRE DROUGHT FLOODING EXTREME HEAT AND SEA LEVEL RISE. AND THEN I'LL TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF OTHER CRITICAL PRIORITIES OF OUR OF OUR AGENCY. SO ON WILDFIRE HUGE THANKS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ARE SPEARHEADING THE MOVE TO ALLOCATE OR APPROPRIATE OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN EARLY ACION. THAT I IS GETTING MONEY INTO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO BUILD OUR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. I'VE TALKED AT THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESPONSE- CAL PRIOR I'M REALLY PROUD TO BE PART OF AN AGENCY THAT INCLUDES CAL FIRE- I CONSIDER THEM THE WORLD'S LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED WILDLAND FIREFIGHTING FORCE. AND THANKS TO YOUR LEADERSHIP WE'RE GONNA HELP THEM ARE EVEN STRENGTHEN THEIR CAPACITY TO RESPOND BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA RESPOND OUR WAY OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE- WE KNOW WE HAVE TO AUGMENT THAT. WITH SIGNIFICANT SCALED INVESTMENTS UP FRONT I IN ADVANCE OF WILDFIRES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF THESE WILDFIRES THAT ARE INEVITABLE IN OUR STATE FROM BECOMING CATASTROPHIC WHICH THEY BECOME. I'M MINDFUL THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS ON THE GROUND IN L. A. COUNTY ARE STILL FIGHTING THE PALISADES OF FIRE AND THAT THIS IS ALARMING JUST GIVEN THAT SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES SO EARLY AND- IN THE YEAR- SO LET ME JUST IDENTIFIED THAT IN THE MAY REVISION. OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCREASE FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE SAFETY I TO THE TUNE OF UP UP AN ADDITIONAL APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT INCLUDES THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS THE STAFF BOTH CURRENT AND THREE ADDITIONAL FIRE CREWS FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN FIRE CREWS UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR FOCUSED ON RESPONSE. FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUE THE PHASE IN OF THE TWELVE NEW CAL FIRE HAWK HELICOPTERS AND THE SEVEN AIR TANKERS. THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO ACCELERATE BASEMENT TO CAL FIRE HELICOPTER BASES AND IMPORTANTLY TO ESTABLISH. AN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LED BY OUR OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD THE WILD HIGH WILDFIRE FORECAST AND THREAT INTELLIGENCE CENTER THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE A CAN TO THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER. AND IS A JOINT PROJECT OF CALIFORNIA- INFO WE ASKED TO BRING THE BAST SCIENCE. AND TECHNOLOGY TOGETHER. TO PROTECT OUR CALIFORNIANS ARE FROM THE GROWING WILDFIRE REST. CRITICALLY THE ESTIMATE REVISION ALSO PROPOSED TO INVEST SEVENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA- AND- WE ASK AND THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. WHILE WE'VE COLLECTIVELY PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA IN RECENT YEARS OFF FOR OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND DIRECT FIREFIGHTING SERVICES ARE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE BACKBONE HASN'T KEPT UP. AND WE HAVE UNIFORMED FIREFIGHTERS I CAN BE OUT- FIGHTING FIRES THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS AND WE NEED TO ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN THE BACKBONE TO ENABLE HOW FAR TO DO ITS JOB MORE EFFECTIVELY SO THAT'S SOMETHING I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT. AND THEN LASTLY A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR RESEARCH GRANT FOR EQUIPMENT AND STRATEGIES TO PROTECT OUR FIREFIGHTERS FROM DANGEROUS CONDITIONS THAT ARE PRESENT DURING WILDFIRES. THAT'S A REAL THAT'S A REAL PRIORITY FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE FRONT LINES. AND THIS ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL- THAT THE GOVERNOR NOW MAKES TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT INCLUDES MAY REVISED AS PART OF A LARGER TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS DISASTER RESILIENCE PACKAGE. I'LL MENTION BECAUSE IT WAS ADDRESSED AND- MISS PETERSON'S PRESENTATION FOR THE CPUC- THE WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION THAT HAS BEEN IN THE CPUC IS WHERE PROPOSING TO MOVE IT TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE DIRECTIVE OF ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FIFTY FOUR AND ASSEMBLY BILL ONE ELEVEN SIGN IN THE LINE TWENTY NINETEEN. I WHICH CALLED FOR THE SET UP OF THE WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION AND ON A TEMPORARY BASIS AT THE C. P. U. C. AND ITS TRANSFER. TO THE RESOURCES AGENCY- THAT'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD I'VE TRANSITION PLANNING I EXPERIENCE WE'VE GOT GREAT LEADERSHIP. IN THE NEW DIVISION AND WE ARE STE WE ARE PROPOSING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN PART BECAUSE THE NEW DIVISION IS ADDING DIRECT ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. IT'S BEATING UP ITS LEGAL TEAM I AND IT'S POSITIONING ITSELF WITH THE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS IT NEEDS AS A PERMANENT DIVISION WITHIN THE AGENCY. THAT'S WILD FIRE LET'S MOVE TO DROUGHT AND WATER RESILIENCE DROUGHT FLOOD WATER RESILIENCE- I MENTIONED THAT WE YOU KNOW ARE NOW FACING THESE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THE GOVERNOR HAS AN EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION ACROSS FORTY ONE COUNTIES. IN THE STATE. WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT THAT WE NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE THE ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE FROM THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO KEEP OUR EY ON THE PRIZE AND CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON BUILDING. DROUGHT RESILIENCE ACROSS OUR STATE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S- A REVISION FIVE FIVE BUILDS ON THE JANUARY PROPOSAL AND NOW PROPOSES FIVE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IN DROUGHT ACTIONS AND WATER RESILIENCE WITH A FOCUS ON PARTNERING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND REGIONS. TO BUILD REGIONAL RESILIENCE. ABOUT ALMOST A BILLION IN NINE HUNDRED NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE PACKAGE IS FOCUSED ON DIRECT DROUGHT SUPPORT. INCLUDING EMERGENCY WATER RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITIES THAT MAY FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT THOSE SUPPLIES. SHOVEL READY MY FUNDING FOR SHOVEL READY PROJECTS IN SMALL VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ARE BEFORE THEY LOSE WATER SUPPLIES. IMPROVED REAL TIME ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING- SO THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE CAN SAVE THE FISH AND WILDLIFE- FROM THE IMPACTS OF THE DROUGHT. THE ADDITIONAL FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IS FOCUSED ON MAKING QUICK ACTION TO DIVERSIFY OUR WATER SUPPLIES ACROSS THE STATE. ENABLE THAT GROUNDWATER USE WHICH IS A CRITICAL A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THAT ALLOWS RURAL COMMUNITIES TO GET THROUGH DROUGHT. AND AS SECRETARY BUMENFELD MENTIONED- SIGNIFICANT FUNDING ON DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER GROUNDWATER CLEAN UP RECYCLING. THE REALLY INNOVATVE PROPOSALS INCLUDING A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR VOLUNTARY LAND RE PURPOSING FIVE FOR COMMUNITIES AS THE IMPLEMENT STATE MY IDENTIFYING THAT DAY THERE COULD BE OPPORTUNITIES TO SHIP LAND USED AS PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THAT- CALM FOCUSED EVEN THOUGH IT'S A pCONTINUING TO SHORE UP OUR FLOOD PROTECTION A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THERE WHICH IS KIND OF. LEVERAGE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING. CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON THE SALTON SEA WITH A PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THERE. AND THEN ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS ARE FOCUSED ON OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT- I THINK IF WE LOOK AT THE LAST DROUGHT WE KNOW THAT MAJOR IMPACTS WERE FELT BY OUR SMALL RURAL **** BUILT I DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BY OUR AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND CERTAINLY BY OUR FISH AND WILDLIFE AND OUR ENVIRONMENT SO OUR OUR DROUGHT ACTIONS NOT ONLY BUILD ON ALL OF THE LESSONS LEARNED THE LAST DROUGHT BUT ARE REALLY FOCUSED THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING HERE. I WOULD SAY THAT THEM THAT THAT IF WE GET THIS FINDING OUT- THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS NOT ONLY THE DROUGHT ACTIONS BUT THE BROADER WATER RESILIENCE ARE AGENCIES COMMITMENT IS TO CUT. THE RED TAPE TO GET THESE PROJECTS ON THE GROUND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE TALKED WILDFIRE DROUGHT. FLOODING KNOWLEDGE TALK EXTREME HEAT. CALIFORNIA RECORD TIME. OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES IN GREATER LOS ANGELES LAST SUMMER. WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AGAINST WORSENING EXTREME HEAT. OUR AGENCY IS PARTNERING WITH THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH THIS YEAR TO UPDATE OUR CALIFORNIA ADAPTATION PLAN AS MANDATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT WILL BE A FRAMEWORK THAT REALLY TIES ALL OF THESE SECTORAL EFFORTS TOGETHER BETWEEN WILDFIRE DROUGHT IT CETERA. THAT WILL INCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY ON EXTREME HEAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THAT REALLY HASN'T BEEN DEVELOPED I LIKE IN THE WILD FIRE OR WATER SECTOR. BUT THERE ARE INVESTMENTS WE KNOW WE CAN MAKE NOW EVEN AS WE FORM THAT THAT STRATEGY FOR OUR BROAD CONSIDERATION INCLUDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT IN URBAN GREENING WE HAVE AN EXISTING URBAN GREENING GRANTS PROGRAM TO SUPPORT LOCAL. VISIT VANTAGE COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFER FROM EXTREME HEAT TO CREATE AND EXTEND THEIR TREE CANOPY TO CREATE GREEN SPACE SAYS POCKET PARKS. WE PROPOSE A HUNDRED MILLION INTO THE COOL BUILDING PROGRAM TO AUGMENT I HAD A PROGRAM AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO. SUPPORT PROJECTS IN LOW INCOME HOUSING AND MULTI UNIT HOUSING TO COOL THOSE BUILDINGS AND IMPROVE THEIR ENERGY EFFICIENCY SO PEOPLE LIVING THERE CAN ACTUALLY SUSTAIN THEMSELVES THROUGH THESE THESE INTENSE HEAT HOT PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY NOT ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR. LOCUST ON I ENABLING THESE ARE LOW INCOME UNITS TO REMAIN- SAFE PLACES TO LIVE DURING THESE HEAT EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE AS- AND ALLOW CITIZENS MARIN SECRETARY ROSS'S- AGENCY BUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A SHE MENTIONED. TO CDFA FOR FAIRGROUNDS TO REALLY POSITION FAIRGROUND AS RESILIENT CENTERS- TO BE PLACES OF REFUGE DURING THESE CLIMATE DRIVEN CHALLENGES INCLUDING EXTREME HEAT. THE LASTLY ON ON RESILIENCE WHEN HE MOVED TO SEA LEVEL RISE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS AND ENERGY AND PROGRESS ACTUALLY ALIGNING STATE AGENCIES WORK ON SEA LEVEL RISE AND THERE'S A LOT MORE TO DO. WITH THE AND PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE KNOW THERE ARE INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE NOW THAT WILL MITIGATE SEA LEVEL RISE AND COASTAL EROSION. SO WE'RE PROPOSING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT INTO COASTAL WETLAND RESTORATION THIS IS REALLY ACT NEED THESE WETLANDS NOT ONLY BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO COASTAL COMMUNITIES BUT THEY SERVICE SPONGES THAT SOAK UP THE STORM SURGES- OFF THE COAST. AND THEN EXCITED TO PROPOSE ELEVEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT STATE PARKS ON NEW C. LEVEL RISE ADAPTATION STRATEGY. OUR STATE PARKS ARE COMPRISES OR ITS JURISDICTION ALMOST OVER ALMOST A THIRD OF OUR COAST HI AND IT SHOULD BE ADVANCING A PROACTIVE EFFORT TO PROTECT THE PARKS IN THE COMMUNITIES ADJACENT TO THE PARK'S FROM SEA LEVEL RISE NEST. WOULD FIND THAT. SO TOLD THOSE THOSE CLIMATE RESILIENCE INVESTMENTS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU CUT THEM- ARE WELL OVER ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. COMPARE THAT TO THE INVESTMENTS IN JANUARY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE OF ABOUT TWO BILLION. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS OUR GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THIS DOWN PAYMENT IN PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND NATURAL PLACES FROM WHAT WE KNOW IS. IS HERE AND GETTING WORSE ALL OF THESE CLIMATE DRIVEN THREATS. TWO MORE PRIORITIES I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE IS INVESTMENTS INTO OUR STATE PARK SYSTEM AND OUR FOCUS ON EXPANDING RECREATIONAL ACCESS WITH AN EYE TOWARDS EQUITABLE RECREATIONAL ACCESS INTO OUR STATE PARKS AND OPEN SPACES- SIX OUT OF TEN CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN PARK POOR COMMUNITIES MEANING- THEY ARE GENERALLY DEVOID OF PLACES TO BE OUTDOORS IN NATURE- FOUR OUT OF TEN CALIFORNIANS HAVE NO ACCESS TO. ANY OPEN SPACE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS WELL WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THIS THE STATE PARK SYSTEM WHICH IS THE BIGGEST IN THE COUNTRY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY. UNITS WITHIN OUR STATE PARKS WE KNOW THAT THAT ACCESS IS ENJOYED IN IN AN EQUITABLE WAY MEANING SOME OF US CAN ACTUALLY GO FAIRLY EASILY OTHERS CAN'T. AND SO WE ALSO KNOW THAT COLD ED ARE DEMONSTRATE HOW IMPORTANT THESE OUTDOOR SPACES ARE ARE FOR US BUT ALSO THEY WERE CONTEMPLATING THEIR- PERSISTING THROUGH THE STAY AT HOME ORDER AND ALL THE CHALLENGES WE HAD. I DIDN'T HAVE PLACES TO BE OUTSIDE AND COULDN'T ACCESS THESE PLACES. SO WE PROPOSE A BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR STATE PARK SYSTEM AND EQUITABLE ACCESS. ARE FULLY OVER THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO STATE PARKS OR WILDLIFE OR I SHOULD SAY WILDFIRE RESTORATION PROJECTS RIGHT NOW FIVE OF OUR STATE PARKS ARE FULLY CLOSED AS A RESULT OF WILDFIRE IMPACTS AND ANOTHER NINE ARE PARTIALLY CLOSED. THIS IS GONNA HELP THOSE PARKS ABI RESTORED AND REOPENED AND THEN SIGNIFICANT FUNDING INTO OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ACROSS OUR PARKS WHICH IS CRITICAL AND THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM RESTROOMS TO PARKING LAST A TRAIL HEADS. ARE THE. PLACES WHERE- WE CAMP. SO NOT ONLY STATE PARKS IS THE FOCUS OF THIS INVESTMENT BUT- HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INTO AN EXISTING PROP SIXTY EIGHT GRANT PROGRAM- SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN APPLY TO DEVELOP- PARKS AND REFERRED BURBAGE PARKS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES- A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IN FOCUSED ON ACCESS PROGRAMMING. EXPANDING AN EXISTING VERY POPULAR PROGRAM CALLED THE OUTDOOR EQUITY GRANTS PROGRAM. I EXPANDING THE EXPLORE THE COAST GRANT PROGRAMS. AND PROVIDING ONE TIME STATE PARK MONEY TO POSITION STATE PARKS TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS. TO BE SORT OF PLUG AND PLAY FIELD TRIP LOCATIONS ARE FOR STUDENTS FROM OUR OUR OUR URBAN- AND- AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS I DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE ACCESS TO OUR STATE PARKS. ALSO VERY EXCITED NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT FOCUSED NINE MILLION DOLLARS ON. HI I'M EXPLORING AND LAUNCHING SOME INNOVATIVE PILOTS TO GET MORE KIDS AND FAMILIES IN THE PARKS THAT DON'T NORMALLY GET THEIR- INCLUDING A ADVENTURE PASSED OFF FOR FOURTH GRADERS- THAT WE WOULD PILOT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE TATE. TO SEE IF I COULD HELP GET- IN IMPROVE OUR EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE PARKS. LAST PRIORITY ALL IDENTIFY IS OUR LAND AND BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION AND RESTORATION. SO AT HEART OUR AGENCY STEWARDS OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND THAT OF COURSE INCLUDES OUR NATURAL PLACES AND THIS TREMENDOUS RICHNESS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. AND THAT THAT THAT THOSE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT ENVIRONMENT IS UNDER A RANGE OF STRESSORS INCLUDING ALL OF THE CLIMATE DRIVEN DISASTERS I MENTIONED EARLIER. SO WE HAVE FOCUSED FUNDING TO SAFEGUARD OUR OUR PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE RESTORE OUR HABITATS CREATE MORE HEALTHY SYSTEMS- SO LAST SUMMER PLANTS AND ANIMALS FIND THEMSELVES IMPERILLED OR OR ALTERNATELY THAT GET LISTED AS ENDANGERED. OUR FOCUS WITH THESE INVESTMENT IS MULTI MULTIPLE BENEFITS SO NOT ONLY IS ARE THEY SMART SMART INVESTMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION BUT THEY CAN ALSO- IMPROVE RECREATIONAL ACCESS. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO RECORD IN THE OUTDOORS LIKE FISHING AND HUNTING- AND THEN ALSO TOSSED MARC LAND MANAGEMENT FOR CLIMATE PURPOSES BUILDING OUR RESILIENCE AND REMOVING CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. SO WE PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A WILDLIFE CORRIDOR AND FISH PASSAGE PROJECTS- GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT A LOT OF OUR FISH AND OTHER ANIMALS HAVE. TO MIGRATE- ACROSS- THEIR LIFE CYCLES I AM REMOVING BARRIERS- AND CONSTRUCTING WILDLIFE FRIENDLY HIGHWAY CROSSINGS EVERYTHING FROM LARGE ANIMALS BIG GAME TOO FAST. AND THEN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR HABITAT RESTORATION THE SUPPORT WETLANDS FLOODPLAINS MULTI BENEFIT FLOOD REDUCTION PROJECTS. AGAIN WITH THAT MULTIPLE BENEFIT FOCUS. I'M REALLY PROUD OF THAT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES TARGETED FUNDING TO OUR DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. YOU ALL KNOW THAT A SERVICE BASED BUDGETING PROCESS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS TO MEASURE THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES VERSES THAT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. AND WHAT WE FIND IS A MAJOR GAP BETWEEN THE RESOURCES THE FISH AND WILDLIFE HOUSE TO DO ITS JOB. AND WHAT WE ASK IS THAT- NOW THIS FIVE PROPOSED BUDGET DOESN'T PROVIDE THE BEST SOLUTION BUT IT PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT BRIDGING SOLUTION WHICH IS EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING. TO ACTUALLY ENABLE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THE HIGHER IN CRITICAL POSITIONS INCLUDING TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES MANAGES ECOLOGICAL PRESERVES AND OTHER PLACES TO LIAISE WITH ACTIVE RECREATIONAL LAST LIKE FISHING AND HUNTING- ARE THOSE WHO WORK RECREATION AT THAT WAY. AND IMPORTANTLY TO DO SOMETHING I CALL UTTING THE GREEN TAPE WHICH IS TRYING TO GET- BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS THE BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES TO GETTING THE GETTING MORE ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION DONE MORE QUICKLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY. ALL TOLD OUR PROPOSED BUDGET. BETWEEN DROUGHT INVESTMENTS CONSERVATION DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL WILDLIFE WENT OUT OVER TWO HUNDRED POSITIONS AND OVER I THINK AROUND TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING TO THE DEPARTMENT GIVEN THAT MUCH NEEDED. MUCH NEEDED FUNDING INFUSION. SO CHAIR THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE LISTENING TO ALL OF US AND OF COURSE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUES AS YOU HAVE. THAT WE WANT TO GIVE YOU GUYS A CHANCE TO PRESENT AT THERE'S A GOOD TO GO TO THE BROWNS YEAH OVER AT THE LA YOU KNOW. YOU GOT A WATER RESILIENCY AND DROUGHT PACKAGE CLIMATE RESILIENCY PACKAGE A SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PACKAGE AND A WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCY EXPENDITURE PLAN UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY OR CALIFORNIA OUTDOORS FOR ALL INITIATIVE SELF SLOT IN. THERE ARE PLEASE. GIVE US YOUR RESP- YOUR THOUGHTS. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN BROWN THE L. A. O. I THINK I AT THE AS YOU SAID THERE IS QUITE A BIT THERE I COMMITTEE STAFF OF ASSET THAT AYBE I START OFF WHICH IS SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON THE OVERALL ARCHITECTURE OF THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION AND THEN I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHO HAVE BEEN DIGGING INTO THE INDIVIDUAL PROPOSAL AND CAN ADDRESS QUESTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO- IT GOING TO EACH OF THOSE. OVER THE COMING MINUTE- I DO WANT TO PREFACE MY REMARKS IN THOSE IN MY COLLEAGUE JUSTIN OKAY WE'VE ONLY HAD THESE PROPOSALS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND SO WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO GET MORE INFORMATION IN MANY CASES AND- WILL BE CONTINUING TO SHARE OUR OUR THOUGHTS- OVER THE COMING WEEKS OF IT. BY THE CANADIAN THE LEGISLATURE TO DEVELOP ITS FINAL BUDGET PLAN- MAYBE TO START IT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST TO STEP BACK THE SECRETARY'S VERY ABLY WENT THROUGH THE MYRIAD OF PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE MAY REVISION- BUT FOR A LITTLE BIT OF A BROADER CONTEXT I KNOW THAT IN AGGREGATE THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE VERY LARGE SPENDING INCREASES. FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO IN FACT IF YOU LOOK IN YOUR AGENDA YOU'LL SEE THAT- FOR EXAMPLE ON PAGE FIVE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUMMARY OF THE CDFA IS BUDGET THERE IT PROPOSED INCREASES OF MORE THAN HALF A BILLION DOLLARS- JUST FOR CFA RELATIVE TO THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. SIMPLY IF YOU MOVED TO PAY FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA YOU'LL SEE THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY DEPARTMENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING NOW EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR THIS IS MORE THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS GREATER THAN WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY THAT'S A 90% INCREASE RELATIVE TO JANUARY AND THEN SIMILARLY FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCE DEPARTMENTS. OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING ANIME REVISION AN ADDITIONAL FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OR 61% MORE THAN WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY. CITY YOU CAN SEE IS. QUITE QUITE A LARGE. IN OR- TO- TO. AND SO WHERE DO THOSE RUN. WHERE THAT WHERE COMING. I'M REALLY FROM TWO SOURCES ONE IS. THERE IS THE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FISCAL RELIEF FUND. AND THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION INCLUDES OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE WATER BOARD- AND- WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. FOR WATER AND SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS DEBT RELIEF ON WATER UTILITY BILLS. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE A VERY LARGE GENERAL FUND REVENUE INCREASES AND OUR OFFICE HAS. IDENTIFIED AN ESTIMATED THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SURPLUS RELATIVE. TO WHAT WAS ASSUMED IN JANUARY SO. THERE'S THE REVENUES OF COURSE IN PROVIDE A REALLY. UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS MANY OF YOUR PRIORITIES. NOT JUST IN RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN AGRICULTURE BUT- ACROSS THE BUDGET. AND SO- WHILE LOOKING AT THESE- PROPOSAL THAT I THINK IMPORTANT KNOW THAT MANY OF THEM DO A LINE WITH SOME OF THE PRIORITIES THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED IN RECENT WEEKS WHETHER THAT'S WITH. RESPECT TO- CLIMATE ADAPTATION. OUR SUSTAINABLE. THERE A LOT OF PARALLELS TO WHAT THE COMMITTEES THE DISCUSSION IN THE RECENT WEEKS AND SO AGAIN THIS DOES THESE REVENUE TO PROVIDE. A SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU. I THINK THAT'S THE SORT OF THE POSITIVE- I DO I DO WHEN IT TURNS JIM THIS IS BEEN ALLUDED TO I THINK IN A COUPLE OF YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR AND OTHERS AS WELL. IS THAT IT IS NOT ONLY JUST A LOT OF FUNDING BUT- IT'S A LOT OF PROPOSALS- IF YOU CAN TELL JUST BY THE LENGTH OF YOUR AGENDA THERE IS QUITE A BIT HERE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AND- WHAT IS REALLY A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME- IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL. NAY REVISION WHERE WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT- JUST MODEST ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON CASE LOW DIDN'T AND- MODEST REVENUE AS ADJUSTMENT. REALLY WHAT WE HAVE ARE A LOT OF PROPOSAL OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT PROPOSAL THAT YOU TAKE APART THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS FOR EXAMPLE OF ALL THE PACKAGES THAT ARE IN FRONT OF YOU- AND YOU DO HAVE THE PACKAGES. MANY OF THEM ARE BIG- YOU YOU YOU FOR COMPARISON- YOU SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME EARLIER THIS YEAR DISCUSSING THE WILDFIRE PACKAGE WHICH WAS A ONE BILLION DOLLAR. PACKAGE RIGHT NOW OVER THE WITH THEM. A YOU. A FOUR BILLION WATER PACKAGE OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND PACKAGE OF BILLION DOLLAR CLIMATE PACKAGE ANOTHER. BILLION DOLLARS FOR ENERGY AND OTHERS AS WELL AND SO THERE'S JUST A QUITE A BIT HERE QUITE A BIT OF IT. IS ALSO NEW- AS MY COLLEAGUE ROSS BROWN MENTIONED EARLIER JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE- ENERGY PACKAGE IN PARTICULAR. THEY'RE A LOT OF NEW PROGRAMS AND THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL THE OTHER ONES WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM. AND THERE'S NOT EXISTING STATUTORY GUIDANCE AND SO THERE IS STILL A LOT OF IMPORTANT POLIY DECISIONS COULD BE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THESE PROPOSAL SO. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE AND WHETHER THAT MEET YOUR- OVERALL BUDGET. PRIORITIES BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT DECISION TO BE MADE ABOUT WHAT THE MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM NOT TO BE. A HOW THEY SHOULD BE STRUCTURED. HOW FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED OR PRIORITIZE WHAT CRITERIA WILL BE USED FOR GRANTS. AND HOW ACCOUNTABILITY WILL BE INSURED. I IN AB TO THAT WELL THERE IN MANY CASES. A LOT OF THE PROPOSAL DON'T REALLY HAVE WHAT WE WOULD DESCRIBE SUFFICIENT DETAIL- SOME OF THE PACKAGES FOR EXAMPLE THE- NARRATIVE THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDE JUST ONE OR TWO PARAGRAPHS. ON WHAT COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL PROPOSAL OF TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND SO. THE STAGE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW IS WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE'VE- HAD. ONGOING DIALOGUES ARE SENDING QUESTIONS TO THEM ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH US AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION. AND WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU AND THE COMMITTEE IS THAT- AS WE LEARN MORE. I'M NOW ALL THESE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FUNDING UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE NUMBER FOR POE'S SOULS. THE NEW POLICIES ALL THIS S ALSO COMPOUNDED AS I NOTED ALREADY BY THE SHORT TIME THAT YOU HAVE. TO MEET A JUNE FIFTEENTH CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE. IS THAT WE DO AN OFFER- AND JUST A COUPLE OF OPTIONS FOR YOU. TO CONSIDER AND YOU DECIDE HOW YOU WANT APPROACH THE BIG COMPLEX PACKAGES THE NEW PROPOSALS. THE ULTIMATE END UP ENSURE THAT YOU END UP WITH THE BUDGET PACKAGE. THAT BEST MEETS YOUR PRIORITIES AND THAT THE- WHATEVER PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED ARE WELL POSITIONED TO BE IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY. AND SO SPECIFICALLY- WHAT WE'VE LAID OUT. FOR YOU IN SOME OF OUR DOCUMENTS IS. TO IDENTIFY. OPPORTUNITIES WHERE. IF THERE ARE AREAS WHERE YOU PROPOSAL MAY REFLECT PRIORITIES OF YOURS BUT WHERE YOU WHERE YOU THINK THERE'S ADDITIONAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE EITHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED. OR ADDITIONAL HIGH NEED TO BE SPENT TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTATION PLANS. TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT THE COUPLE CHOICES THAT YOU YOU HAVE. ONE OPTION IS YOU CAN TO FIRST ACTIONS- IS NOT BEEN UNCOMMON IN RECENT YEARS WHEN- THERE BEEN THESE KIND OF PROPOSALS OF HAPPEN TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN HAS BEEN ONE EXAMPLE. WHERE WE DEFERRED ACTION EVEN DEFERRED ACTION UNTIL THE SUMMER. AND TO GIVE YOURSELF SOME MORE TIME TO DEVELOP A PLAN AND ENSURE THAT. MEMBERS ARE ON- ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE SO YOU CAN DO THAT YOU COULD. IDENTIFY CERTAIN AREAS THAT YOU ARE OF IMMEDIATE CAN- CONCERN IN PRIORITY INCLUDE THOSE IN YOUR JUNE FIFTEENTH BUDGET. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE- WATER PACKAGE WE'VE EMPHASIZED THAT WE DO THINK FUNDING IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RELIEF. SHE I SHOULD BE A NEAR TERM PRIORITY BUT ON OTHER ONES THAT MAYBE ARE NOT AS IMMEDIATE OF THE NEED YOU HAVE THAT OPTION TO DEFER SOME ACTIONS UNTIL. UNTIL THE SUMMER- IN OTHER CASES IT MAY MAKE SENSE- MAYBE FOR SOME OF THE NEW PROGRAMS TO PROVE SOME SMALLER AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN THE NEAR TERM IN THE BUDGET YEAR- THAT COULD FIND. INITIAL STAFF A COMPLAINT. FUND PLANNING ACTIVITIES. THAT CAN MAYBE. ALLOW AND A DEMONSTRATION BEGIN IMPLEMENTING A NEW PROGRAM A NEW EFFORT. BUT THEN THEY COULD COME BACK NEXT YEAR IN THE BUDGET CYCLE. TO REQUEST SUBSEQUENT FINDING- YOU CAN ALSO. POTENTIALLY A SOME. PROPOSALS CONTINGENT SUBSEQUENT POLICY LEGISLATION IF SOMETHING THE PRIORITY YOU GTU. YOU WANT IMPROVE THE FUNDING BUT ULTIMATELY THINK THERE'S ADDITIONAL. WE WOULD NOT YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF APPROVING A FUNDING BUT WITH ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THIS IS. PRETTY TYPICALTHAT COULD BE IF IT'S MEDIA REPORTING IT COULD BE TO JAIL THE C. FORGET. OR COULD BE REPORTING IN SUBSEQUENT. THAT COULD ALLOW YOU TO APPROVED BY FINDING IT A PRIORITY TO YOU- BUT ULTIMATELY ENSURE THAT THERE'S SOME ACCOUNTABILITY THERE'S REPORTING BACK TO YOU ON HOW. PROGRAMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN HALF WHAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE- IN ANOTHER THESE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF ANY OF THESE DEPENDING ON THE PACKAGE IN THE PROPOSAL. SO I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT COULD PRETTY QUICKLY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS FOR THE MINISTRATION OUR STAFF SO I'LL STOP THERE AGAIN OUR STAFF IS AVAILABLE. TO ALL OF YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND THEN AS WELL AS TODAY AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. WHILE EVERYONE'S FREE MAY BE COMING TO FRUITION BECAUSE AS HE RAN OUT OF TIME TO CHEER HAS LIMITED HAS LESS AND LESS OPTIONS ASK QUESTIONS. I WANTED TO GO BACK TO FINANCES. THE US FINANCED TO WEIGH IN ON SOME OTHER. REFLECTIONS. WE HAVE. FROM THE OVERALL PUT. HI GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS SERGIO I OVER THE BAR TO FIND A SOLDIERS MAKE UP BRIEF GIVEN THAT THERE FOR- VARIOUS- INTO FOR BOTH IN THE MAYOR. SO BE CALM OF THE- AND FEDERALLY FUND. ARE REALLY ALLOWING. TO MAKE ONE IN A LIFETIME INVEST IN THE FEW OF THE STATE. AND PROVIDES A HISTORIC UP. TO THE MYSTERY CLAY INITIAL. WE WENT COME WITH THE- FROM THE GOVERNORBUDGET. THE MAYOR VISION FOR OF THE- OVER FIFTY BILL DOLLARS. IN ADDITIONAL FIND THAT WOULD. THE UNDER THE ALLIANCE. REDUCE CARBON. THE SUSTAIN AGRO. SUPPORT PARKS ACT AND FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND ALSO. TO GROW. AND MARK. AMONG OTHER INVESTMENTS. NOW WHILE ACTOR OUTLOOK AS- REVENUES HAVE IMPROVED IN. THE SENSE THE COVER BUDGET. THE SAME BUDGET RESERVE AL THE STATE GET THROUGH THAT AND- WILL BE TO PROTECT PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE. AND ALSO THE STATE PREPARE FORMER. ALTHOUGH THE FORECAST DOES NOT PROJECT AND LARGE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. THE RISK TO THE FOR ME. I AND REST WE THE TIME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND ONE TIME OF SURPLUS. REALLY DO CAN. THE A BILL TO SEE. X. ONGOING COMMIT. SO THIS. AT THE VERY. I FRONT OF YOU REALLY ARE ARE SIGNATURE ONE TIME INVEST THAT ARE NEEDED NOW IN ORDER TO OUR BANDS ARE ARE CLIMBING AND ALSO HELP THE STATE. OF ITS RECOVERY FROM THE PEN- I'LL LASSIE JUST KNOW THE WE'RE- AS AN ADMINISTRATION WORKING TO BILL. TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND LEGISLATIVE. IS A LOT OF- PROPOSAL HERE AS OVER TRY TO PROVIDE MUCH IF AS- AFTER THEIR HOUSE. THANK YOU SIR. WE'RE GONNA OPEN THE DISCUSSION ONE OF. OUR I DO Và C BY STERN ONE OF THINGS MAYBE FOR CONCERN OFF AND THEN THE SECRETARIES TAKEN. IF WE LOOK AT EACH NUMBER FOR DECLINE. RESILIENCE PACKAGE. AND IT'S SEVEN AND EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY PACKAGE. WE HAVE A CENTER PROPOSAL FOR OF UPON OUR BOND SEEMS LIKE A BILL TIME OPPORTUNITY SINCE WE HAVE SO MUCH MONEY AND WITH FEDERAL MONIES AND SURPLUS MONIES. BUT THAT'S IN THE TUNE OF FIVE POINT SIX FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION THEN YOU HAVE THE ADMIN THE ASSEMBLY WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON A CLIMATE RESILIENCY PACKAGE IN THERE. NORTH THE SEVEN POINT EIGHT I THINK IS WHAT. IT'S UP TO RIGHT NOW- IS THIS. ENOUGH OF IN THE- GIVEN THE URGENCY THAT WE HAVE WITH CLIMATE RESILIENCY THAT WE'RE BUSY BEING PROPOSED I KNOW THAT THERE'S OTHER THINGS IN THE OTHER PACKAGES BUT- YOU GET THE LEGISLATURE. BETWEEN FIVE AND A HALF AND SEVEN AND A HALF OR SOMETHING IN THOSE LINES AND THIS IS SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR MILLION. AND THIS AND ON THE THAT INVESTMENT COULD YOU. RESPOND TO THAT. YEAH HAS LARGEST- CAN MAKE A CLEAR BUYING CLEAR BUYING THE CLIMBERS BILLION PACKAGES BILLING. THE SENATE EIGHTY FOUR IS A TWO ONE TO TWO. BUT THERE'S AMOUNTS INDIA HERE SO IT'S A TOUGH OF ONE THREE- SO GLAD YEAR'S INDUSTRY AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD PROPOSED A TO AND FIND BUT IT INCLUDED MORE THAN THIS COME. I THINK AS VIEW OF TO WE THE WA IS GOING AT WE THE WALLS ARE PACKED. WE HAVE THE ACT PACKAGE AND THE CLIMATE IS BY PACKAGE. AS SO KIND OF A AND. IF YOU CAN OF COMPARE. AFTER THE BOND LAST YEAR IT'S SOME OF ALL THOSE THAT WE WERE KIND CAN OVERALL CLIMATE REVEAL INVEST AND SO I THINK THAT THE ONE THREE AND A CLIMB EVERY PACKAGE DENNIS. IS ISN'T THERE SO OF TIME TO GO INTO BASS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SOME THE OLDER PACKAGE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT. MORE KIND OF A COOL. TO THE- OTHER PROPOSALS YOU RECKON. IT'S SECRETARIES ANYBODY WILL. AT HONOR THIS. I WOULD JUST REINFORCE WHAT SURGE SAID I THIS IS THE OF NO BOB. BECAUSE YOU'RE THE CLIMB RESILIENCE BY BROUGH THAT WERE BEING THIS LAST YEAR INCLUDED THOSE INVESTMENTS IN WATER IN WILDFIRE MORE BROADLY THAN WHAT'S BEEN DEFINED AS CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE EIGHT PAGES SO AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON I THINK WOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING MORE NOW THROUGH THIS ANNUAL BUDGET THEN AT LEAST ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL DEAD LAST JANUARY AS A- AS A BOND PROPOSAL. MICELLAR C. CAN YOU OF ELIMINATE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING STILL MORNING GOOD MORNING RACHEL A LIST WITH THE LARGEST ANALYST'S JUST JUST I THINK THIS YOUR QUESTION MISTER TEARS A GREAT ONE AND REALLY HIGHLIGHTS HOW COMPLICATED THIS ISN'T FOR YOU ALL BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST THINKING ABOUT ONE OF THESE PACKAGES TOGETHER YOU REALLY DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT THEM ALL INTERCHANGEABLY AND WHAT ARE YOUR OVERALL GOALS FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION FOR- YOU KNOW FOR DROUGHT. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T REALLY LOOK AT THESE AND ISOLATION- AND THAT DOES MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED- BUT WE WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE YOUR OVERALL GOALS AND THEN REGARDLESS OF WHICH PACKAGE IT IS IT IS CAP AND TRADE ALSO NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE BUT AND MAKING SURE THAT EACH OF YOUR PRIORITIES THAT WHETHER IT'S FROM YOUR BOND PROPOSALS OR OR ALL THE DISCUSSIONS YOU HAD OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. THAT THEY ARE LOCATED SOMEWHERE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T KIND OF ISOLATED INTO ONE. MISTER SEPARATE I KNOW THAT THIS. OR THIS CAN CHICKEN. FOR A FIVE YEAR. WILDFIRE PLAN THAT MEANT IN WITH THE EARLY ACTION THAT THAT NEGOTIATED WHAT WAS. IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS MAY REPOSITION. AT LEAST FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO GO ON AND THE WILDFIRES JUST A REPEAT FROM JANUARY. RATHER THAN. A REFLECTION OF THE I'D LOOK AT LEAST THE SENATE CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY LOUIS LOOKING FOR A FIVE YEAR TERM. OF A LONG TERM INVESTMENT INTO THESE. THIS AREA. CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT IS IF IT SEEMS TO GET OUT OF. THERE IF THERE IS A. A LITTLE BIT OF A TWO WOULD BE. TO REPEAT FROM JAN. AT WOULD DO YOU TAKE FROM THE IS YEAH I CAN.

IN THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE USED FOR WILD IS A- POTENTIAL AS WELL AS HAS THAT. THE OFF OF A MEMBER SERVICES FOR THERE'S TWO IN YOUR FIFTY NINE THAT COULD BE USED FOR HIGH. A OF THAT PROPOSED. AND OF COURSE THAT IS THE NECESSARY GETTING FOR WHILE SPECIFICALLY COULD BE USED A VARIETY TO TYPES OF. BUT THAT'S I KNOW BEHIND IF THAT THE MINISTRY HAS PROPOSED AND COULD IT KIND OF FIGURE IN YOUR- DELIVERY AS YOU ABOUT HOW MUCH HE WON ABOUT TWO WILDFIRE CERTAINLY AS YOU YOU MENTIONED THE SENATE HAS FOR. ON THE SENATE DEMS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE- ANSWER ABOUT TERM SO IN TERMS OF HAVING YEAR. OKAY YOU'RE FINE THIS REALLY A JUST A WAY YEAR PROPOSAL VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN JAN SAID THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE ONE THING THAT I. ME WANNA CONSIDER I DID WAYS WHETHER THIS IS THAT THE FINE LEVEL THEY PREFER OR WHETHER HER FOR A DIFFERENT FUNDING. FORGET HAVE BEFORE I GO TO SAN REQUIRE IF YOU HAVE A- A CAN RESILIENCE QUESTION SENATOR STERN HE WAS TALKING TO THE- NINETY MILLION FOR STRUCTURE GROWTH. FOR REACH CLIMB CLEVER. HE WENT TO THE- AND IT SAYS IT APPEAR. DESCRIBE THE PROBE BEYOND THE PRESS RELEASE OF NINETY NINE. WHICH DESCRIBES. THIS ROLE INTENDS TO TAKE THIS STEP OF A PROGRAM SEES HE'S ASKING ABOUT THE STATE. THE STATUS IS AFTER IF WE ANYBODY. THE GROWTH CAL. SERVER TECHNICAL. IF YOU WERE TO TARA FROM I CAN GIVE A- QUICK AND THAT'S OKAY WE WERE LOVE TO HEAR THE DATA TO ZARA IS THIS HEARING HEY WELL. IT FINDS THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE'S HER SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY TWO SO IT WOULD FUND THE CAPACITY BUILDING GRANT PROGRAMS THAT THAT STATUTE CALL FOR THAT HAD NOT HAS NOT YET BEEN FUNDED AND SO THAT IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT DIRECT COMMUNITY CAPACITY TO ENABLE COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES THAT CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN RESILIENCE AS WELL AS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND JUST TRANSITION PLANNING AND COMMUNITY WORKERS SO THAT IS THE FUNDING THAT IS PROPOSED IN THAT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE. PROGRAM IN THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CHAPTER- I'M NOT SURE AGAIN I'LL HAVE TO CIRCLE BACK AND LOOK AT WHERE THEY NINETY ONE MILLION IS THAT MUCH THAT'S IN REFERENCE TO- BUT THAT TWENTY MILLION AS WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN THAT AGES. AGO SENATE MCGUIRE. RECOGNIZED THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR- JUST GOING THROUGH SOME OF THESE ITEMS I JUST WILL TAKE DOWN SOME- SOME SPECIFIC POLICY ISSUES FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR MISTER CRAWFORD MISTER CRAWFORD I THINK YOU SEE SECRETARY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY. AT THROUGH THE CHAIR. AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE AND WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SECTOR CRAWFORD FOR ALL THE WORK WHETHER IT'S ON ISSUES OF FIRE. FOCUSING ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND STATE PARKS ADVANCINGJUSTICE I NEEDED FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK TO YOU IN THE GOVERNOR. ON THE ISSUE OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION. BECAUSE THE COMMISSION REALLY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE LEADERS IN WITH STATE AGENCIES ON THEIR MISSION AND C. LEVEL RISE AND- THE BEEN VERY HELPFUL ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH COAST. IN A DISTANCE HE NEED TO SHOW FUNDING THROUGH THE COASTAL COMMISSION. ON THE SEA LEVEL RISE INITIATIVE LAUNCHED. MR SECRETARY I KNOW THERE'S I THINK TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN THERE- FOR PLANNING OUTSIDE OF THE COMMISSION I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. ON THE COMMISSION'S FOCUS ON ON SEA LEVEL RISE AS WELL. YEAH I THINK SO MUCH SENATOR YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN A LEADER- ON ALL THINGS RELATED TO SEA LEVEL RISE GIVEN ITS JURISDICTION. THEY'VE ALSO BEEN PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN A REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE. EFFORT ACROSS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN OUR AGENCY AND BEYOND OUR AGENCY TO GETON THE SAME PAGE AND START TO BE MORE PROGRAMMATIC. MORE COMPREHENSIVE MORE COHESIVE ABOUT HOW WE'RE PLANNING AND ACTING ON SEA LEVEL RISE- YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THIS. THIS PROPOSED BUDGET DOESN'T FIVE PROPOSED MORE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION. I WOULD DESCRIBE DAY THE PROPOSALS WITH AN R. C. LEVEL RISE PROVISION AS A DOWN PAYMENT- ALTERNATELY ON ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIND THAT. HITHANK YOU HEY THAT'S IS ONE ITEM THAT I THINK WILL NEED TO HAVE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON A MISTER CHAIR JUST THROWING THAT AT YOU IN REGARDS TO CLOSE COMMISSION IN AGAIN- LOT TO LIKE AND APPRECIATE THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE COAST COMMISSION THE REASON WHY I BRING THAT UP THEY HAVE BEEN- THE OVERSEE SO MUCH DEVELOPMENT- AND HAVE THAT LONG RANGE PLANNING- AND AT THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE OF PUTTING SOME DOLLARS INTO THEIR INITIATIVE. THE SECOND PIECE IS JUST SOME COMMENTS. THAT THE EIGHTY MILLION FOR NON MOTORIZED TRAILS AND THAT'S BEING PROPOSED- I THINK THAT IS GOLDEN- ESPECIALLY BUILDING UPON OUR NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLAR. OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL ICONOMI WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT TRAILS DUE TO REVITALIZE RURAL COMMUNITIES- IT'S CRITICAL AND I THINK THAT IS. A RULE JOBS INITIATIVE AS WE LOOK AT THAT EIGHTY MILLION. FOR NON MOTORIZED TRAILS THAT WILL HELP SOME OF THE POOREST COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. ON THE THIRTEEN ADDITIONAL FIRE CREWS. GRATEFUL FOR THAT INVESTMENT I THINK THAT THE CONCERN REMAINS IS THAT WERE STILL UNDERSTAFFED COMPARED TO WHERE WE WERE WITH PEAK STAFFING WITH CAL FIRE. HI HUNDRED AND 10% AGREE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK UPSTREAM THAT'S% BEEN A MISSION I HAVE A CHAIR Y. CASKETS HERE FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN REGARDS TO. WILDFIRE PREVENTION VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ETCETERA- AND WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WILDFIRE RESPONSE. GRATEFUL FOR THESE ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN FIRE CREWS TO BE OUT OF BACKFILL THOSE FORTY TWO HUNDRED- INMATE FIRECREWS THAT WE HAD THAT WE LOST. I SINCE OVER THE LAST DECADE I THINK THERE'S STILL NEEDS TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL WORK WITH CAL FIRE- IS WELL. A COUPLE OTHER ITEMS IN REGARDS TO SECRETARY ROSS SECRETARY RICE IF WE COULD TALK QUICKLY ABOUT THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. THAT'S BEING PROPOSED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST AT FAIRGROUND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE ESPECIALLY FOR HEAT AND FIRE. SECRETARY ROSS CAN YOU TALK WITH US ABOUT YOUR- ADDITION FOR A PROCESS OF ENGAGING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND HAD TO GO TO GET THOSE DOLLARS MOVED. INTO WHETHER IT'S AN AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION I COUNTY FAIRGROUND EXEDRA CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THAT'S GOING TO ROLL OUT IN. YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCALS PLEASE. IF THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS WOULD BE ADOPTED. YEAH THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH- WE AS A BILL PR WILL BE ESPECIALLY CRITICAL TO THIS PROCESS. BECAUSE OF THEIR ONGOING WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO WE ENVISIONED DOING ROUNDS OF LISTENING SESSIONS AND WORKSHOPS- TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY AREAS- AND WHAT WHAT'S BEING EXPRESSED ACROSS FROM. FOR EXAMPLE COUNTY SUPERVISORS THAT DUSTY SACK NOW HAS A RESILIENCY COMMITTEE THAT MEETS FREQUENTLY AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH THEM SEVERAL TIMES. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AS WE START START TO ESTABLISH CRITERIA FOR WHAT NEEDS TO BE GOING INTO PLANNING. ON MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING THE COMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS LIKE WHAT YOU TARA ALREADY MENTIONED AS FAR AS CAPACITY BUILDING. SO THAT ALL VOICES ARE HEARD AND THAT PLANNING PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SAFELY EVACUATE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THE LONG LIST OF NATURAL DISASTERS THAT ARE THAT ARE CAUSING THE EVACUATION. AND THAT WE HAVE FACILITIES THAT ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO DO SEVERAL THINGS ONE IS TO BE SAFE BECAUSE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND HIGHER CHISEL OF THESE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE. THEY'RE SAFE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE. EXPANDED BATHROOM AND SHOWER CAPACITY IS THAT'S NOT NORMALLY SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS A LOT OF FOCUS ON FOR YOU KNOW THE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED ONE OTHER TIME SURE FOR PERSONAL KITCHENS. BUT HOW DO THESE FACILITIES ALSO HAVE THE BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN SOME EFFORTS- TO ENHANCE THAT PROCESS. AND THEN PRIORITIZING AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THIS WIH LIMITED DOLLARS WITH INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITIES WHERE ARE THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED FACILITIES. WHAT IS THE STATE OF THOSE FACILITIES SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP A GOOD PLAN FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS CHECK OUT AFTERWARDS I DON'T KNOW THAT COMPLETELY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS. BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE WITH EXTENSIVE PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT GOING TO THE COMMUNITIES AND HEARING BUT THEY NEED AND WHAT THEY WOULD RECOMMEND. THAT WE DO AS FAR AS I DON'T FINE PLANNING TO. FROM IMPLEMENTING. OF FACILITY AND- PROJECTS IT KNOW THANK YOU SO MUCH MY SECRETARY I KNOW THE EDITORS GO TO TALK ABOUT HARDENING JUST. IT MA'AM CENTER JUST PRETTY QUICKLY SECONDS OR LESS BECAUSE I KNOW WE ARE TIME IS LIMITED MISTER CHAIR. CAN YOU JUST ANSWER- SO YOU LOOK AT IS A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. IN YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS WOULD ROLL OUT. IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT YOU'RE NUMBER ONE I THINK THE OTHER REALLY BIG PIECE THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH EVACUATIONS WE'VE EVACUATED. LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLKS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. IS THE NEED FOR PETS. PEOPLE NOT EVACUATE IN FOR NOT BUILDING IN- IN AREAS FOR PETS- I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE REALLY CRITICAL- LARGE ANIMALS CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF WE TYPICALLY GET CAPACITY IT MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS BY SPECIALLY CATS AND DOGS. THAT BECOMES IF I COULD BE CANADA REAL CLUSTER- AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE FOCUSING ON AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT SHOWERS AND BATHROOMS BECAUSE FOLKS JUST ONE OF ACCURATE WITHOUT THEM. MIGHT MY LAST PIECE ON THIS IF IT'S ALL RIGHT. MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO SAY ON THE ADVENTURE PASS THIS IS BEEN SOMETHING THAT- HAD OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT. ASKED AFTER CRAWFORD IS ADVANCED IN SONOMA COUNTY ANY KID CAN GET IN WITH A LIBRARY CARD TO REGIONAL PARK. AND REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS FOCUS ON EQUITY SECTOR CRAWFORD IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN IN- I THINK IT WAS- LAST DECEMBER NOVEMBER. WE MET IN PRESHEAF OR FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS ONE THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE ESPECIALLY. FOR KIDS WHO WOULDN'T OTHERWISE ACCESS A PARK- I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE A GAME CHANGER FOR THAT IN THE SECTOR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO MENTION X. I KNOW. THAT'S BEEN A PARTY FOR YOU AS WELL. I'LL CAN CURRENT JUST SHARE THAT IN A CINEMA WAS A MY- I WE ARE THINK ABOUT THIS. THESE PILOTS AND- THERE ARE ALL TYPES OF CREATIVE APPROACHES TO BRING FAMILIES AND KIDS IN THE PARKS THAT NORMALLY CAN'T ACCESS THEM. SO THAT THESE PROPOSED PILOTS ARE BUILT ON THOSE EXPERIENCES AND CINNAMON BEYONCE JUST THANK YOU. I AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND INNOVATION NETWORK SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCHER DEPUTY. MUST A HORA CAN YOU WE TOOK WE HEARD ABOUT THE WE S. HAVING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR HARDENING OF ALL TYPES OF FACILITIES. CAN YOU TIE THAT MONEY INTO THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR THE FARES AND WHAT HOW THAT MIGHT WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU NEED TO. GET FIFTY A. COUNTY SEE ALL HAVE COUNTY FAIRS AND DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THAT MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HOME HARDENING AND THAT. THAT BATCH OF- PART OF MONEY. YET YOUR WIFE WHITE COUNTY THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I'M IT'S KIND OF PREMATURE TO MAKE A LOT OF SPECULATION ON THE APP IS SECRETARY ROSS ALLUDED TO. WE NEED TO GO THROUGH A VERY PUBLIC PROCESS. BEST TO GET STAKEHOLDER AND BUT- IN JUST TO REEMPHASIZE OUR CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH- YES MEANS THAT WILL BE SHARING A LOT OF INFORMATION SO THAT WE WANT TO GIVE IT UP OF THOSE DIFFERENT EFFORTS AND SO THAT. WE CAN OPTIMIZE HOW THAT MONEY ROLLS OUT IN PROVIDES THE MOST. RESILIENCY TO THOSE COMMUNITIES SO WE'LL BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM WE WILL BE TAKING AN OVERALL LOOK ALL THE AGENCIES RESPONSIBILITIES AS WE DEVELOP THOSE PLANS TO GET INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC. THANK U. S. SECTOR S. CENTER DOLLY. THE USER CARE AND THANK YOU TO THE REGISTRATION AND ALL THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY I'M GOING TO JUST DO IT THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL BECAUSE- I GOT THIS INFORMATION LAST NIGHT AND I STAYED UP VERY LATE. DIGGING THROUGH IT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT HERE I HAVE NEVER IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF BEING ELECTED EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING SO. LARGE AND JUST- THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL LAW A LACK OF DETAIL I SHOULD SAY THERE'S A LOT OF PROPOSERS I JUST WANT TO SAY FIRST OFF. I WANT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR- DOING ONE TIME INVESTMENTS I THINK ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED IN A IN A TIME WHEN WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE. TONY JUST SHARE THAT WITH YOU I THINK. TO THAT- WE HAVE FIRES AND DROUGHT THAT I THINK ARE TO THE TOP PRIORITIES IN THE STATE- NOT ONLY FOR- YOU KNOW THE HABITAT AND WILDLIFE IN THE WATERSHED TO GET AFFECTED BY FIRE WHICH IMPACTS DROUGHT- ALSO- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A STRUCTURE. ISSUES WE HAVE WITH FAIRGROUNDS IN THE LIKES OF WHICH WOULD WHICH WE SEEM TO BE USING EVERY SINGLE YEAR NOW AND WAS IT USED TO BE- MAYBE MORE. YOU KNOW EVERY THREE OR FOUR YEARS SO I WILL I WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M CONCERNED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THEM HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THIS ALL ACCOMPLISHED IN THERE'S NOT BEEN MUCH DETAIL AND IN THE POLICY PART OF IT IS. IS THE SPENDING IS THERE AND NOW IT'S- THE POLICIES IN MORE HOW WE'RE HOW WE'RE GONNA IMPLEMENT THIS AND- AS SOMEBODY WHO'S RUNNING LEGISLATION TO TRY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE SOME OF THESE IMPACTS LIKE WILDLIFE IMPACTS I'M I'VE HAVE LEGISLATION THAT IN ITS IN ITS MY BILLS ARE GOING TO SET THE SUSPENSE FILE WHICH BECOMING OUT. AT THE END OF THE WEEK IT'S- INTERESTING TO ME THAT WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING ON SUSPENSE ARE SO MUCH RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA THE LIKES LIKE NONE OF US EVER SEEN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE SEEING INFLATION- BUILDING RIGHT NOW JUST BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH MONEY AND FUSED. NOT ONLY. IN CALIFORNIA BUT- NATIONWIDE. AND SO I'M I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT MORE THAN THAT I JUST WANNA SAY I DO. THINK WE SHOULD BE SPENDING THESE RESOURCE ON ONE TIME PROJECTS THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED AND THEN- HITTING THOSE TARGETED AREAS THAT WE KNOW. HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM FOR SPURS FOR SOMETIME WHICH YOU HAVE ADDRESSED THE FIRE IN THE IN THE DROUGHT ISSUES AND TO GET THOSE. OF MONIES AVAILABLE- TO THE AGENCIES AND PLACES WHERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY DURING THIS DROUGHT TIME- I THINK IS A- WOULD BE APPROPRIATE SO WITH THAT. I'LL SAVE A LOT OF MY COMMENTS ACTUALLY FOR WHEN WE SEE THE FINAL BUDGET WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. DIG A LITTLE DEEPER- BUT THIS IS REALLY LARGE AND I THINK THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT SCARY TO ME THAT WE HAVE THIS MUCH. MOVING THIS FAST AND TO TRY TO. HAVE THE LEGISLATURE KEEP THEIR ARMS ON EVEN THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE- ADMITTED THAT THEY- YOU KNOW THEY HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY DIG INTO THIS AND SO I THINK. WE SHOULD MAYBE LOOK A LITTLE BIT OF CAUTION AS WE GO FORWARD AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT- NO THE RESOURCES ARE SPENT WISELY SO AGAIN THANK YOU ALL TODAY FOR A PARTICIPATING. A SUPER XCITED ABOUT- SEEN SOME OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS AT THE SAME TIME ABOUT HOW MUCH THERE IS- HAPPENING AS WELL. THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY THOUGHT TESTIFIED TODAY WERE UNFORTUNATELY OUT OF TIME SO I HAVE TO MOVE TO THE PUBLIC HEARING. I APPRECIATE.
