THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TWENTY FIVE MLLION IN THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL IS FOR ZERO BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF. MISUNDERSTANDING THERE I THINK. THE. THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY. HAD BEEN FUNDING OR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN FUNDING THAT PROGRAM OUTSIDE OF THE CAP AND TRADE BUDGET AND IS ZEROED OUT IN THAT PART OF THE BUDGET IS NOW. INSERTED INTO THE CAP AND TRADE BUDGET. SO THE FUNDING REMAINS LEVEL UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL LEAVES TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING AND. THE A ARE F.

BOB SAID I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT. I GET THAT RIGHT. COULD JOB BLOOM. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER MILLER. JUST THINKING WHICH CHAIR THANK YOU FOR OF ALL THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THESE VARIOUS CAP AND TRADE ITEMS I JUST WANTED. NOTE.

SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS AND AS YOU INDICATED HIS CHAIR THAT WILL BE A SUBJECT OF SOME ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION IN CONGRESS TO HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE SENATE. LINE ITEM IS ON THAT PARTICULAR ITEM DO WE HAVE A SIDE BY SIDE OF THAT IT JUST IT'S A CURIOSITY. WE DO WE JUST NEED TO FIND IT ON THEIR PROPOSAL. SO THEY THEY. OFFENDED A HUNDRED TWO MILLION. THEY CONFORMED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SO THAT WILL BE AND CONFERENCE AND THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. WHAT THE CONFEREES CAN CONTINUE TO TO DISCUSS? ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. AND NAPA IS IF THERE A MOTION ON THIS ISSUE. ISSUE ONE. THE ASSEMBLY CAP AND TRADE TO EXPENDITURE PLAN. LAMB. I FONG. KALRA. MULLIN. PATTERSON. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT ISSUE. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND THEIR RESOURCES BOARD IS ISSUE THEIR ISSUE ONE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSALS. OKAY. WE'RE GONNA. WHICH JUST CHECK THEN AND CONFIRM THAT ELLIOT FISK AND MAKE A PRESENTATION ON THIS ITEM TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU RELATES TO THE GOVERNOR'S ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INITIATIVE WHICH JUST AS REMINDERS BEEN HEARD IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS BUT INCLUDES. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR TO ONE AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. AS WELL AS TO WHETHER MILLION ANNUALLY FOR. REBATES FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. SO THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. THAT'S A STAFF BUT THAT THE STAFF IS RECOMMENDING INCLUDES A VARIETY OF PIECES SO THAT INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS. ADOPTING PLATE PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO CONDUCT AN ANNUAL EVEY MARKET STUDY. IN THAT MARKET STUDY WOULD INCLUDE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. THINGS INCLUDING MODEL IN. PROJECTIONS OF SAYS OUT TO AT LEAST TWENTY THIRTY. INCLUDING PROJECTED SALES FIGURES AND IMPACTS OF FEDERAL POLICY CHANGES AMONGST OTHER THINGS. THE REPORT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SURVIVOR RESULTS OF CONSUMER AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE OF EP'S AND AWARENESS OF CHARGING STATION LOCATIONS. AND MODEL SEVERAL A REBATE SCENARIOS GIVEN. DATA IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON ADJUSTMENTS TO THE REBATE OR A PROGRAM TO MAXIMIZE REBATE EFFECTIVENESS. IT WOULD ALSO DOT PLACE ORDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF FIFTY MILLIONS AS BY TWENTY THIRTY. REQUIRES A ARE BE TO USE THE CDC STUDY TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL STATE REBATE INVESTMENT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. REQUIRES A ARE BE TO USE THE STUDY TO RECOMMEND ANNUAL CHANGES TO THE CVR P. IN REBATE STRUCTURE. TO MEET THE FIVE MILLION EVEY GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY. REQUIRES A RB TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN A CUSTOMER BUYING GUIDE THAT INCLUDES INFORMATION. ABOUT MAKES AND MODELS OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON INCENTIVES. ALSO AS IT RELATES TO AND I'M. ON PAGE THIRTY TWO NOW OF YOUR AGENDA AS RELATES TO THE EEVEE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL. VIA A RECOMMENDATION BEFORE YOU WOULD BE TO APPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR IS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT. AS MISTER CHAIR MENTION NOT BACK FILL THE LOW CARBON FUEL PRODUCTION WITH TWENTY FIVE MILLION CAP AND TRADE FUNDING AND INSTEAD FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. PROVIDE TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION FROM THE A. R. S. B. T. F.. SO FUNDING FOR FROM A OUR FTTP WOULD BE. SIXTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION PLUS SOME OF THE OTHER ONE TIME FUNDS THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NO LONGER PURSUING THE EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE NEW SOLAR HOME PARTNERSHIP FUNDING THAT WOULD GO TO SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE AND THAT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. WOULD SIMILARLY NOT INCLUDED. THAT FUNDING FOR SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE. THE PROPOSAL WHAT ADOPTS PLACE WHERE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES C. C. TO INCLUDE IN THEIR ANNUAL STUDY. OF GAPS IN EVEY INFRASTRUCTURE. STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT OF THE EEVEE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT. THE FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE GOAL AS WELL AS THE STATE'S FORTY PERCENT GHG REDUCTION GOAL OUT TWENTY THIRTY. IT WOULD ADOPT PLACE ORDER TRAILED A LANGUAGE THAT REMOVES THE PROHIBITION ON AIR BE FROM ENACTING REGULATIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE BUILDING OF HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. A PROHIBITION WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED AND LEGISLATION A FEW YEARS AGO. AND FINALLY WOULD REQUIRE CC TO DEVELOP A STANDARD INFORMATION LABEL FOR ALL PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS TO HELP CONSUMERS. MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS WHEN THEY. PURCHASE ELECTRIC FROM THE STATIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. SIMILAR TO OUR.

AND IT DOES I RIGHT NOW I GOT THE FUEL AND TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY LANGUAGE IT'S IN THERE THE PROGRAM IS FOUR ZERO AND NEAR ZERO I. FEELIN IN VEHICLES AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING THIS MORE OF A ZERO EMISSION OP PROGRAM. AND DEATH FOCUSING MORE TO COMPLY IS A FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THE EXECUTIVE ORDER FOUR FIVE MILLION SEVEN BY TWENTY THIRTY SO WE DO ASK THAT. CONSIDERATION BE TAKEN THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT INCLUDED STRIKING OUT THE A NEW TROUT YOU TYPE YOU TRY LANGUAGE THANK YOU.

OF PUTTING LARGER INVESTMENTS IN SEVEN TO STRUCTURE. IS MADE WHOLE THE GAP IS STILL QUITE HIGH BETWEEN WHAT IS BEING MADE. INVESTMENTS BEING MADE BY THE BY THE STATE BY THE UTILITIES BY ELECTRIFY AMERICA IS STILL PRETTY HIGH SO ANY REDUCTION IS OF A CONCERN. AT TWO POINTS ON THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THE AIR BE STUDY THAT WOULD RECOMMEND ANNUAL CHANGES TO THE CD R. P. STRUCTURE. I WOULD PROCEED WITH CAUTION ON THAT ANNUAL CHANGES WOULD HAVE BIG IMPACTS ON THE MARKET AND WHAT CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND FROM YEAR TO YEAR OF WHAT THEIR INCENTIVES MAY OR MAY NOT BE. SO MAYBE ANNUAL CHANGES.
