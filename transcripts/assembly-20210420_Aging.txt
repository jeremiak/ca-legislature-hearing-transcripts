THE NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH DISABILITIES WILL INCREASE FROM ONE MILLION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO THREE MILLION IN TWENTY SIXTY. CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION IS ALSO INCREASINGLY SUFFERING HOMELESSNESS. ACCORDING TO UCSF RESEARCHERS APPROXIMATELY 50% OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY AND HALF OF THOSE BECAME HOMELESS AFTER THEY REACHED THE AGE OF FIFTY. ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO FULL INCLUSION AND EQUITY FOR ALL AGES HIS ELDER ABUSE WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO IMPACT 10% OF OLDER ADULTS. LIVING AT HOME AND TO RESULT IN LOSSES TOTALING IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO ADDRESSED THIS. THE TWO PRONGED ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AND ELDER ABUSE EFFECTIVELY THE STATE NEEDS TO OF INVEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INTO PLANNING AND SUPPORT SERVICES. TO FILL SUCH A NEED AB SIX NINETY FIVE WOULD EXPAND AND ENHANCE THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. BY INCREASING COUNTIES CAPACITY TO PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND BY BUILDING UPON THE SUCCESSFUL HOME SAFE PROGRAM TO ASSIST ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICE CLIENTS WHO NEED HELP WITH HOUSING ISSUES.
