02:28:57.928 --> 02:29:01.832
COMPLICATED LITTLE ISSUE- AND-

02:29:01.899 --> 02:29:04.335
HE HELPED US A LOT- VERY VERY

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:05.936
BRIEFLY THIS BILL DOES NO

02:29:06.003 --> 02:29:08.839
CHANGE AT ALL TO WHAT A JUDGE

02:29:08.906 --> 02:29:09.807
EARNS UNDER THE RETIREMENT

02:29:09.874 --> 02:29:12.510
PLAN- YOU KNOW YOU ARE PROMISED

02:29:12.576 --> 02:29:13.844
A CERTAIN AMOUNT UNDER THE

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:16.213
PLAN. BUT IF YOU HIT THE

02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:18.582
FEDERAL CAPS IN INTERNAL

02:29:18.649 --> 02:29:20.751
REVENUE CODE SECTION FOR

02:29:20.818 --> 02:29:22.153
FIFTEEN YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT

02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:24.221
YOU WERE PROMISED. SO YOU WOULD

02:29:28.426 --> 02:29:30.895
WELL THAT FEDERAL LIMIT GOES UP

02:29:30.961 --> 02:29:31.829
FROM TIME TO TIME AND SO THE

02:29:31.896 --> 02:29:34.131
QUESTION IS CAN YOUR AMOUNT GO

02:29:34.198 --> 02:29:35.499
UP WHEN THE FEDERAL LIMIT

02:29:35.566 --> 02:29:37.535

02:29:37.601 --> 02:29:39.337
STATE EMPLOYEES IT DOES BUT I

02:29:39.403 --> 02:29:40.905
THINK IT'S JUST A QUIRK IN THE

02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:42.173
LAW I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY

02:29:42.239 --> 02:29:44.675
POLICY REASON. FOR EXCLUDING

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:47.011

02:29:47.078 --> 02:29:49.380
IT JUDGE TO GET MORE OF WHAT

02:29:49.447 --> 02:29:52.183
THE PROGRAM PROMISED THEM UNDER

02:29:52.249 --> 02:29:54.585
THE RETIREMENT LAW- SO AT THE

02:29:54.652 --> 02:29:59.056
