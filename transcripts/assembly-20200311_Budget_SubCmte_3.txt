WE HAVE A RELATIVELY SPARSE SHOWING THIS MORNING WHICH MAY BE A OF WE HAVE A SHORTAGE GENDER I PREFER TO THINK OF IT THAT WAY. THAT'S NOT THE FACT THAT. WE HANG UP. AS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHICH FORM OF GREETING TIAS- ALBUM THAT BUMP. HELLO CAN I PERSONALLY THIS MAY CHANGE NEXT WEEK BUT I'M LIKE INTO JAZZ DANCE. OF FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE JUST DYING TO KNOW. OF. MY COLLEAGUES TELLING ME THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION BUT REALLY ISN'T. OF WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS FOR TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT SAYS I THINK EVERYBODY HERE. ALREADY KNOW SENT- ALSO- THE CHP WILL BE WITH US LATER ON IN THE AGENDA WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ITEMS ON THE VOTE CALENDAR BUT NOT ABLE TO ROLL CALL VOTE YEAH UP. HOLD UP VOTE ONLY WE ARE PULLING THE ISSUE FIVE OFF OF VOTER WAIT FOR THE- MOVING INTO THE FUTURE MANY. OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OF. GREAT AND MADE THAT'S BECAUSE SAFETY STANDARDS OR WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ON THE EFFORTS THEY'RE GONNA BE TAKE AND THAT GUARD. THE OUR FIRST DEPARTMENT IS. EXCUSE ME ARE THEM AS THE PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERSHIP INFORMATION ITEM ONLY ISSUE ONE. IN MISTER TAYLOR YEAR HER FOR THAT A CAN STEP FORWARD. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DROVE HERE BECAUSE THERE'S A BAN ON FLYING. OF YES FROM YOUR INSTITUTION IS THAT RIGHT- AT TWO PM YESTERDAY YES THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY NO LONGER PERMITTED. BUSINESS TRAVEL THE AIR. THOUGH AND HERE YOU ARE SO- I READ BECAUSE I THINK THE CONGO AUTOMATED VEHICLE IN ORDER TO TALK ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSI AND- THANK YOU FOR MAKING THAT EXTRA AFTER. THAT ACTUALLY I THINK IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND THAT IS OF A WE HAND ON- INPUT- IN OUR IN OUR HEARINGS HERE AND MUCH OF IT COMES IN THE HOUSE. FROM THIS IS THAT AFTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT WE DEPEND PUBLIC PUT IN A SOME OF THIS WITNESS. YOUR SELF AND OF COURSE THE PROCESS. IS A POLICY CAN. ALMOST SOLELY ON COMING FROM IS STEP OF THE EIGHT TO TESTIFY BOB THIS IS AN ISSUE ENTER THE PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO COME BY VIRTUE OF POLICY OR OTHER CONCERNS IN CONSIDERATION AND I'M HOPING- THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES IN OUR- CITIES. WILL ALLOW FOR REMOTE. THINGS LIKE THAT- TO ALLOW US TO AS BEST WE CAN CONTINUE TO CONDUCT THE IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT WE HAVE- AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE FOR A CYCLE. OF THE- LOOK WE'RE GONNA BEGIN OF THIS DISCUSSION WITH- LA SO REPORT. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND EUNICE ROW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO I WILL BE SPEAKING FROM THE HAND THAT THAT WAS HANDED OUT TO YOU AND THAT'S HOW THEY WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEB SITE. M. L. COMMITTEE STAFF AT BEST TO PRESENT- A COUPLE OF BACKGROUND PIECES ON TRANSIT. FIRST ON AND THE ROLE TRANSIT HAS AN REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- AS WELL AS SOME BACKGROUND ON IN STATE FUNDING OF TRANSIT SERVICES IN THE STATE. SO IF YOU TURN AGE WINE. THE TRANSPORTATION IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEIR RESEARCH BOARD ESTIMATES ABOUT 39% OF GHG EMISSIONS COMES FROM THE TRAIN STATION SECTOR AND A LARGE CHUNK OF THAT COMES FROM ON RESOURCES INCLUDING PASSENGER VEHICLES AND TRUCKS BUSES. AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE AT EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR COMES FROM THINGS THAT L. I. SHIPS AND PLANES BUT THE MAJORITY TRUMP I'M SORRY SAYS. AT THAT'S THE- A LOT OF ATTENTION AND PAID. AND HOW THE C. CAN EDUCE GHG EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND ONE POTENTIAL STRATEGY IS TO. SHIFT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE DRIVING PRIVATE VEHICLES TO AB MORE EFFICIENT MODES OF TRANSIT I'M MODES OF TRANSPORTATION INCLUDING TRANSIT. AND SO I AND PAGE TWO YOU CAN SEE THAT TRANSIT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SAM CONGESTION AND FUEL EFFICIENT AS A RESULT- PRODUCE LESS GHG EMISSIONS THAN PRIVATE. VEHICLES SO VARIOUS TYPES OF TRANSIT HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED ON AVERAGE TO ESTIMATE TO EMIT LESS A MISSION STAND A SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES SO FOLKS DRIVING ALONE IN THEIR CARS. BUT OF COURSE THE EFFICIENCY OF THESE MODES ARE REALLY DEPEND ON TWO CRITICAL FACTORS OCCUPANCY- AS WELL AS ENERGY SO OF COURSE THE MORE FOLKS THAT ARE WRITING UP I STILL LOWER MISSION IS PER PASSED MILE. SEC I AM SAID THAT ENERGY IS ALSO A KEY FACTOR IN DIET AT. HYBRID BIAS WOULD PRODUCE LESS EMISSIONS PER MILE PER FIRST SAYS AB. I DIESEL FUEL BUS. HI AND SO I'M MOVING ON TO KIND OF THE SECOND PORTION OF THAT THE BACKGROUND ON TRANSIT- THE FUNDING SO TRANSIT IS FUNDED THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES- BUT NEARLY HALF OF THE STORE SAYS ARE COME FROM LOW. LOCAL TAX REVENUE. I'M IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE TWELVE BILLION I'M WAS BUDGETED. AND WAS SPENT FOR TRANSDUCER PROCESS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- AND BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PRESENTATION OF FOCUSED- FIND KIND OF THE STATE PROGRAMS FOR TRANSIT. I'M FIND PAGE FOUR- WE CAN SEE THAT IN MORE DETAIL SAID DIFFERENT STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSIT SERVICES AS THE FIGURE ON PAGE FOUR AND SHOWS THE MAJOR SOURCES- THE STATE LEVEL THAT FUND TRANSIT THIS TRANSIT STANDS AT EXCEPT. THE MAJORITY I'M- IT'S FUNDED BY THE STATE SALES TAX ON DIESEL TIME AND IT'S ALLOCATED OPERATORS ON A FORMULA BE SAYS- IN IT ALLOCATE NEARLY BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TEAM. I OTHER PROGRAMS. SMALLER ON KIND OF VERY IN THAT SOME ARE. IT'S A DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY FOR TRANSIT OTHERS ARE KIND OF MORE BROADER TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS WHERE TRANSIT PROJECTS CAN BE FUNDED- TICKET AREA IN THE WAY THEIR ALLOCATED SUMMER COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS OFFERS OUR FORMULA I'M PROGRAMS. TA I'M IN THE ALSO. TYPES OF- PROJECTS HE FINDS SOME CAN FIND NO CAPITAL PROJECTS- LIKE PURCHASING PROCESS BUT OTHERS- I ALSO FOUGHT OPERATIONAL COSTS. AND SAID. I'M AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER TAYLOR SHORT I'M IN SO OF YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF- YES I I'M BRIAN TAYLOR AND A PROFESSOR OF URBAN PLANNING AND PUBLIC POLICY IN THE UCLA LET PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND I'M DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE TRANSPORTATION STUDIES AT UCLA I'M ALSO CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL OF DIRECTORS OF THE USE YES TO TRANSPORTATION STUDIES AT BERKELEY DAVIS IRVINE UCLA. AND WHAT HAVE TO DO ABOUT REAP WE'VE BEEN DOING AT. ON THE A THE FACTORS BE FOLLOW TRANSIT RIDERSHIP RECENT YEARS AND NHà WHAT BEHIND THAT WHAT COULD BE DONE IT DIDN'T AND HOW WE CAN REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDY OF PUBLIC TRANSIT IN ORDER TO GET BOTH MOBILITY BENEFITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM THAT INVESTED ACTUALLY COMMENT ON A COUPLE OF POLICY PROPOSED. TALKED THAT WE ARE INTO THE OF BILLS IF THE VERY LARGE OF REPORTS TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS ERODING IN CALIFORNIA AND- AND AROUND THE COUNTRY THIS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BUT TO KEEP IT IN THE BIG PICTURE IS WELL IT'S DOWN IN ABSOLUTE TERMS IT'S RELATIVELY MODEST SO THE DECLINES- ARE NOT ENORMOUS BUT IT'S A LITTLE ALARMING THEY'RE GOING IN THE DIRECTION THEY'VE BEEN GOING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN ECONOMIC UPS THOSE. GO TO OTHER OF. WHAT'S MORE CONCERNING. IS NOT THE TOP LINE NUMBERS BUT THE WRITERS PER CAPITA OR THE TRIPS PER PERSON. BECAUSE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN GROWING. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OF THE START OF THE RECEPTION. WE HAD A DECLINE IN PER CAPITA RIDERSHIP- ACROSS THE US. IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN GREATER LOS ANGELES. THAT WASN'T NECESSARY A SURPRISE DURING SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THINGS DID TO IMPROVE COMING OUT OF THE RECESSION. BUT THEN WHAT'S- IT'S ABOUT FORTY. IS THAT. CAPITAL SHIP IS BEEN GOING DOWN AGAIN. BUT SIXTEEN THEY WERE THEM BECAUSE- AGAIN ECONOMIC AND WOULD PROTECT. OUR SHIP THESE. THE MOTHER. ROCHE BASRA ACROSS THE OF A RAY RIDERS REBEL OUT OF THE WRIST BUT IT TO HIS STARTED DOWN AS WELL SO WE HAVE WE HAVE TWO MAJOR TRANSIT ROAD STATEWIDE THAT ALSO TING RAPPERS ADDED AND THAT WILL BRING A LOT MORE. ON ONE THING I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS ENORMOUSLY ASYMMETRIC ITS ASYMMETRIC SPACE ASYMMETRIC TEMPORARY TEMPORALLY IT JUST DOESN'T SEVEN EVENLY DISTRIBUTED SO FIRST THING NO IS IT A FEW PEOPLE MAKE MOST OF THE TRANSIT. SEC IF YOU NAME CITIES. THE TRAIN TRIP. HEARD IS THAT A FEW ARE I AND THOSE OPERATORS CARE MOST OF THE PASSAGE. SO IT'S EXTREME UNEVEN WITH TO THE NOT PORTION OF ELATION SO JUST COUPLE OF THE EMINENT IT PULLS A IT IS AB. THERE ARE TWO MARKET PUBLIC TRANSIT PLACES THAT ARE HIGHLY AGGLOMERATED WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO DRIVE AND PARK. IN THE SECOND ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED ACCESS TO BILLS THOSE THE TWO KEY MARKETS AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A- COUPLE OF. AND THAT. THIS POPULATION DENSITIES IN AND HAVE AS PEOPLE PER MILE WHICH ARE THERE PLACES IN LOS ANGELES IN THE BAY AREA THERE LIKE THAT IF WE LOOK STATION WIDE ONLY 30% OF THE US POPULATION LIVES IN PLACE AS WITH OVER TEN THAT PEOPLE SQUARE MILE. BUT OF ALL. PLACE IS ABOUT. SIX OUT OF TEN. ICAL HOUSEHOLD ACTUALLY BEEN TO COME A LITTLE BIT STATE IN AND ACROSS THE- ABOUT 5% OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE IN THEM OKAY. THE POST HOUSEHOLDS ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST HALF OF ALL THE TRANSIT IN THE IN THE COUNTRY ALMOST HALF IN CALIFORNIA. ENORMOUS A CEMETERY A FEW OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS MAKING A LARGE NUMBER TRIPS IN A FEW NEIGHBORHOODS ARE CARRYING MOST OF THE STRIPS. SO IN LA. A DATA WE DID AND I KNOW COATED HIS DANCING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THIS IS THE WHOLE REGION WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE AG READ. ABOUT TO SET ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SCARE AN AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE TRIP ON. I ABOUT BUT TWELVE TRIP SEBRING'S IT UP ABOUT 78% OF THE POPULATION RIDE THE FEWER THE TRIP A MONTH THERE ARE MOST OF THAT AT ALL AND SO IT MEANS IS THING HAVE TO THAT POPULAR VERY HAVE TRADING USE IT HAS OUT. FOR OUR- THE A LITTLE BIT THE POPPY CAN HAVE A- AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW SO FOR EXAMPLE WE CALCULATED FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. OF THE LA MATCH AND IT 472% OF ALL OF THE STATE'S RIDERSHIP LOSSES IN A PART OF THAT BECAUSE IT HAD SOME OF THE MOST HELP. NICE LOT. AS IT HAD OF ARJUNA PEOPLE VERY FREQUENT RIDE. IN THE BAY AREA OF WE HAD SORT OF HEARTENING COUNTER CYCLICAL TRENDS WITH THE BAY AREA ACTUALLY UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO WITH WAS DOING TO ADD RIDERS BUT ALMOST ALL OF THOSE WERE RUN TRANSBAY BART TRIPS THE RIVER THE REGION MUCH LIKE THE REST OF THIS WHICH IS. THE ROAD. THIS IS WHAT IT WHICH IS A SAM CISCO CB. WITH HIS SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT WAS KIND OF CARRYING THE WHOLE STATE ALONG WITH WITH RIDERSHIP INCREASES. WHAT ARE SOME O THE REASONS BEHIND THIS IS. WE HAVE CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENTS WITH WHICH TRANSIT CAN OPERATE SO THESE OF THESE THESE DENSE HIGHLY A LOT RATED PLACES. OTHER IS CHANGES TO ACCESS TO OTHER MODES OF THOSE WE THINK ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MADE BEHIND IT. OUTSIDE OF THE- YEAH. THE BIGGEST STORY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND REALLY IN THE TWO THOUSANDS HANDS. IS WE'VE SEEN INCREASING AUTO ACCESS AMONG LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS GENERALLY HI I'M HOUSE OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BEEN INCREASED AUTO A- BUT IT'S BEEN. LONG DOES THE RIVER HELLO. OTTO SAYS OUT OF. YES THAT MEANS. IT IS. REDUCTION AND VEHICLE HOUSEHOLDS STATE. REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THAT 5% CARRIED ALMOST HALF THE RIGHT. LOOTING HERE ZERO. BE GOOD HOUSE OVERALL ABILITY BUT IN TERMS OF THE SHIP IS QUITE DE BE THOSE PEOPLE ARE WRITING SO FREE AT BAY AREA INTERESTINGLY HAS NOT HAD THAT THAT A CHANGE IN VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; EXCESSIVE TALK LATER WE&lt;/c&gt; DID. STE IS THE MALL THAT ESTIMATED ALL ALL OF THE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP LOSSES WE'VE SEEN IN THE TWO THOUSANDS. IT CAN BE EXPLAINED LARGE BY INCREASE IN AUTO ACCESS IN PLACES OUTSIDE AREA- AND IN THAT THIS IS DETAILED IN THE REPORTS THAT WE'VE DONE. AND JUST FINISHED. REPORTER FOR THE- THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN JOBS AND HOUSING IN THE REGION AND WE SUSPECT THAT THAT'S REAL RELATED TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. SO WE'RE- THINKING IN THE BACK AS WELL S THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AFFLUENT COMMUTERS COMMUTING INTO JOB CENTERS. BUT AROUND THE REST OF THE STATE STAYING. OFF PEAK TIES IN SUBURBAN SYSTEMS ALL OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND AS- ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE'S ONE MARKET. GOING IN AND OUT OF DOWNTOWN SERVICES GOING TO THE BIG JOB CENTER TO SORT OF HOLDING UP IN THE BAY AREA. BUT TO THE BAY AREA ALSO LOSE IT DOES OFF PEAK THE MIDDAY EVENING. IS OUT IN BURBS ALL THOSE IS GOING. WE THE- HALE HIS HAVING DONE THE WAY RIGHT HAS MARKET IS TO BE PEOPLE TRAVELING TO AND WORK AN UNDER BASIS BUT IT MIGHT BE A MAKE AROUND DURING THE DAY OR AND SAT EVEN. GOING TO THE AIRPORT. CASE SO PART OF THAT. IN AN RIDERSHIP IT OTHER TIMES BEEN LIKELY AFFECTED BY RIGHT HILL AS WELL WHAT ARE SOME OF THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS JUST TO WRAP UP AB. WE'RE SEEING FEWER REDUCE TRANSIT DEPENDENTS OVER TIME IT OR CHOICE WRITERS WITH ACCESS TO CARS IN THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE IN THE SENSE IS THE BAY AREA. NOW IF YOU'RE JUST LOSE. STRATEGIES TO GET OCCASIONAL RIDERS TO RIDE MORE AND TO GET PEOPLE WHO NOW NEVER RIGHT TO WRITE OCCASIONALLY AND- EFFORTS TO DO THAT ARE REALLY LIKELY TO BE. HAVE MORE AUTO OWNERSHIP IN IN AND FOR EXAMPLE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THERE OFTEN VEHICLE DEFICIT HOUSE WHICH IS. A CAR A LICENSED DRIVER. CAN HOUSEHOLD WHERE THERE MIGHT BE THREE LICENSE DRIVER IN ONE CAR SO THERE'S STILL TRANSIT USE THEIR IN DOING MORE TO THOSE PASSENGERS A WRITER'S IS IT IS WELL A SECOND. AREA IS THAT WE SIMPLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT CONFRONTING MANAGE PRIVATE VEHICLE TRAVEL. AND IF THEY'RE IF HEAVY RAIL HAS A THIRD RAIL IF THERE'S A THIRD RAIL IN POP IS TRYING TO MANAGE THAT ICAL TRAVEL. BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE SCARES THE NEXT. WORKING MORE PEOPLE. ARE IT. IS HAVE A POSITIVE. THE ENVIRONMENT ON CAN ALL IN SLOW DOWN TRANS. AND WE CAN READ HER HANDS AROUND THAT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THE TRANSIT TRANSIT. CAN TINKER IN THIS WAY BUT- HAND. AT NOT LET HAVE MUCH OF. YOU CAN SEE. IF I WAYS PETER THE ROAD HOW. WE DRIVE PARKING BETTER BUT RIGHT. IT PEOPLE OFTEN MISSES THE ACTUALLY MAKE IT A BETTER RIDING BUT PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE JUDICIOUS THEIR USE OF THAT. I THREE BECOMES A MUCH MORE TO OF IT EVEN HAS BEEN FIRED IT'S WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RURAL AREA BUT IN IN CAN. AREA NOW. IT IS IT IS EFFECTIVE. I WILL TURN OF ANY PART BECAUSE IT MOVES TO ME. PLEA THREE STREETS WITH THAT IN LONDON. IN IN A THIS THERE CAN JUST PRICING TO. PAY FOR THE LONDON UNDERGROUND UPGRADES I NEXT BENEFIT WAS A HUGE INCREASE IN BUS WRITER BECAUSE NOW LET'S MOVING AROUND SO MUCH WORK. SEC THAT'S SORT OF PERVERT THIS. TRANSIT WHICH IS A YOU KNOW IT A POLICY THAT'S BEING. TALKED ABOUT A LOT AND IT TRANSIT WELL PUBLIC IT'S SO CERTAINLY SOMETHING. OUT IN AS A MENTION TRANSIT USERS TO DEPORT DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME. AND ENFORCEMENT EXPENSIVE. OF AND ALSO. IN FEAR OF INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT MAYBE WE- DO SO I THINK THAT THERE'S THIS THIS ARGUMENT FOR WHY CHARGE FAIRS AT ALL IN AYE. IT IS WORTH A LOOK. THE NEGATIVE I'M NOT GONNA COME DOWN HARD IN THIS POSITION WHEN WITH OTHER. BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS. WE KNOW THAT. THE MORE EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE TRANSIT TRIPS ARE CONSUMED ON AVERAGE BY THE HIGHEST INCOME WRITERS SO THINK WITH THIS WITH SOMEONE DRIVING. GOING IN THE PEAK HOUR IN THE PEAK DIRECTION TO THE SENATE THIS IS A BUSINESS DISTRICT IN LA OR- SACRAMENTO OR THE BAY AREA. THAT COSTA INTO SYSTEM A LOT OR THE- DAY TRIP ON A BUS OR A WEEK ENERGY TRIPPIN OFF. XIN FIFTIES THE SKI THE ROCK. IN HIGHER THAT. THE SO. L. WE SAY THAT THE SUBSIDIES HER. PER MILE THE MUCH HIGHER FOR A- THERE'S A LOWER INCOME RIGHT. IF WE PROVIDE FREE TO EVERYONE THAT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. THAT THAT UNEQUAL SUBSIDY IT IS THE SEVEN THE COST OF PROVIDING A FREE RIDE SOME KINDS OF WRITERS INSPIRED. IS THAT VERSE PERHAPS. EQUITY ISSUES BECOME AN ISSUE WITH FOR TRANSIT. A SECOND IS THAT AB WELL SYSTEMS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING RIDERSHIP THEY AGAIN SCALE THEIR SYSTEM FOR THEIR PEAK DIRECTION PEAK DEMAND. THAT'S WHAT DRIVES THEIR- SO BART RIGHT NOW IT FINISHING THAT COURT THE PATH TO THE EXPANSION IN THE- IN THE THAT CENTRAL AIR. THREE THREE BILLION DOLLARS THEY'RE LOOKING AT. EIGHT BILLION. THANKS TO GRAY THAT IS BASED AS AN. AMANDA THE PEAK TIMES IN COULD INADVERTENTLY INCREASE COSTS A LOT. SO OF THE FINALLY THERE IS RESEARCH ON FARE FREE TRANSIT AND IT DOES SUGGEST THAT LOWER INCOME RIDERS WILL TEND TO RESPOND MORE THAT TH HIGHER INCOME WRITER SO THAT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT BENEFIT CAN ACCRUE TO PROVIDE CARE FREE IT. THERE'S GONNA SUCH PEOPLE ARE MORE LA IN THE WRIST TO BETTER TRANSIT SERVICE THE LOWER TRANSIT PRICES THAT IS THAT EVEN A PLAN COME LEVELS PEOPLE ARE MORE RESPONSIVE LOWER WHAT TIMES IN YOUR TRANSIT SERVICE EVEN IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SO. ABOUT TWO WEEKS THREE HUNDRED AND MILLION DOLLARS IN ELIMINATING FAIR IS A DO WE SPEND THREE AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN INCREASING THE FREQUENCY AND RELIABILITY A BUS SERVICE. ON AVERAGE OF WITH MORE RIDERS DOING BATTER AGAIN THAT THAT'S NOT IN ALL CASES AND THERE MAY BE A CASE AND I COULD TALK ABOUT IT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT A WIN. WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES COME RIGHT. AND IF IT MORE. HE CAN OFF BEACON BECAUSE HIGHER INCOME WRITERS TO RIDE IN THE PEAK ACTION THE PEAK HOUR. DOING THINGS LIKE SAYING YOU PAY ONLY FOR THE PEAK HOUR PEAK DIRECTION TRIPS AND THEN WE PROVIDE YOU FREE TRANSIT AT ALL OTHER TIMES. WE LIKELY HAVE MUCH. LOWER FINANCIAL HIT BANDED UP. AND WOOD I THINK IT FREE TO A- AND- A WAY A DELIVER THOSE BENEFITS TO LOW INCOME ROCKERS ENCOURAGING WILL. BE SHIPPED. GETTING THE- BENEFIT. FOR S. S. SENATE BILL ONE WHICH WE- FUN FOR THE- THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE DATA MAJOR STUDY AND N. OCTOPUS GAG- THAT WE RELEASED ON LA. DID A SECOND THAT WE JUST REALLY TO THEM HE'S AND WE'RE DOING A STATE WIDE ANNOUNCES THAT WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE- PROBABLY IN THE EARLY SUMMER AT LET. HAVE FOR AT WITH MONEY FROM CAP. AND ALL OF THAT IS MATCHED BY FUNDING FROM FROM SB ONE AND- ALLOWED US TO GEAR UP AN EXAM THIS PROBLEM SO QUICKLY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD IN. THE PAST MUCH. ACTUALLY ALLOWED YOU TO MOVE FOR WITH THE COLLABORATIVE THAT IS. PROJECT NOW PRODUCING. THE INFORMATION THAT YOU BROUGHT TO US HAD ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT JUST- A REMINDER. THE MAT. MEDIA CAUGHT. HI HOW. THE ROLE. MONEY CAN. HAVE A- WE GONNA THROW BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND WE'LL TAKE ROLE AND TO VOTE ONLY CALENDAR. LET HERE FONG GARCIA YEAH MULLIN PATTERSON BRASS. RIVAS SO WE HAVE A QUORUM AND- WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR DO WE THE- TAKE MORE THAN ONE DOLLAR YES WELL. ALL THE ITEMS I IT'S A IT'S A S. SEVEN THREE MIRACLE- WAIT. WHILE I PULL FIVE BUT YEAH YEAH. RIGHT MORE. IF THANK YOU BLOOM I FONG GARCIA MULLIN PATTERSON RADIUS RIVAS. I THINK THAT IS THE FIRST OF THE SEVERAL YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN SHARING THAT SUBCOMMITTEE SO CONGRATULATIONS EVERYONE. YOU UP PROFESSOR YOU MENTION BUT- THIS- KIND OF CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN- FREE TRANSIT LOW INCOME WRITERS AND ALSO TALKED ABOUT I'M SORT OF SEE AS- AS TEN OF FIVE ACCESS TO. BILLS THE RACING AUTO ACCESS IN COME COMMUNITY THE BOUNCE OF WHICH FOR BLOWING ISN'T IT. I THINK THIS WILL PLAY BETTER ELSE IS WHAT POLLUTION ELLEN THE UP AND THEN CONGESTION. HOW DO WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES OF THE ISSUES OF POLLUTION AND CONGESTION AND MAINTAIN A MARKER TO THE XIN THAT HAS THAT HAS TAKEN. SO OF THE WAY I WOULD PUT IT IS THEY HAVE SPENT THE BETTER THAN A CENTURY DESIGNING CALIFORNIA CITIES AROUND PRIVATE VEHICLE TRAVEL. AND IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US THAT AFTER IS EIGHT THE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACCESS ICAL DO A SIGNIFICANT IF IT'S- THE PROBLEM IS. THAT THE COLLECTED USABLE THAT TRAVEL IN IT IN POSES ENORMOUS BURDENS ON ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND ON SOCIETY. AND THE WAY WE PUT IT IS THAT PROBABLY IS NOT A BAD THING THAT THAT IN SOME REAL WHEN COME HELL SO WE'RE ABLE TO DRIVE A LITTLE MORE. ALL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CREATE IT SENT. TO THE EVERYONE LOVES LESS. AT THOSE THINGS ARE NOT NECESSARY IT ALL ADDS I DON'T WE'D WANT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY TO. I BEEN FORTY OUT OF SOMETHING THAT APRIL EVERYONE ELSE ENJOYS. AND THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE I MADE THE COP ABOUT YOU KNOW THE TRANSIT OPERATORS. DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AND IT'S REALLY RIDERSHIP. IT IS OPERATE WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND ACT IS A- THE PROCESSING POWER. THAT MAKE IT EASY EN CONVENIENT FOR EVERYONE TO DRIVE TO MOST DESTINATIONS AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE THAT. IS GOING ON LIKE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE STRUGGLE AND- THE DELAY HAVE IS AT THIS PEOPLE IF YOU WERE ON PUBLIC TRANSIT AND STUCK IN TRAFFIC IN ITSELF FIND TO GET A CAR AND DRIVE. THE LOWER YOUR TRAVEL TIMES EVEN AS YOU IMPOSE MORE DELAY. THE PEOPLE LEFT ON THAT TRANSIT VEHICLE THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE IN ACTUAL BEHAVIOR RESULTS IN INTO A COLLECT TIONAL RESULTS. AND SO UNTIL WE HAVE SOME OF AN INCENTIVE SYSTEM IN PLACE. WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE THE REGULATE THROUGH PARKING. USE OF ROADS OR WE DID AT LEAST IS TO PRIVILEGE. MOVEMENT OF HIH IF IT'S A VEHICLE AND ROADS AND I KNOW THAT AN ISSUE HAS BEEN INCREASING INTEREST IN IN A IN A FOR EXAMPLE BUS LANES DIFFICULTIES IN POUNDS OF AND TING THOSE. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS CAN PRIDE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THINGS AREN'T AREN'T.AND THERE IS THROUGH. THE USE TAX THE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE DO. WE CAN REGULATE MOVEMENT ON THE CROWDED STREETS AND ROADS TO VARIOUS KINDS OF PRICING SCHEMES THAT WE CAN THEN PROVIDE. DRIVERS WITH LIFELINE. SURE THE- AROUND. ALL OF THAT. TRAVELING FOOT BY BIKE BY BUS AND BY SCARED RIDE TO IN SEASON TRACK. AND THOSE THINGS WILL CALL INTO PLACE BUT RIGHT NOW TO BE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS SOMEONE OWN THEIR CAR AND DRIVING IT ANYTIME THEY WANT ME WHERE THE- ANSWER OFF THE TABLE. AS LONG AS THE IS WE'RE GONNA BE STRUGGLING AROUND. IS OTHER OPTIONS. IF WE'RE ABLE TEST A TAB THAT. I THINK THAT THE OPPORTUNE. OF CREATE MORE TRACTOR TRANS WORK OUT WE BECAUSE- DEPEND ON IN PART ON IT ABILITY TO MOVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THE SAME DIRECTION THE SAME TIME. AND IT DOES THAT WORK YES HI CONSIDER HOW. WAIT SIR. COMES VERY ATTRACTIVE. BUT THE DIFFERENCE EVERY MINUTES. WILL BOULEVARD OR ON MARKET STREET. AND HALF HOUR OR HOUR SERVICE IN IN AND OUT PINE. WHERE IS ENORMOUS. WHERE WE GONNA GET THE- WHERE CARS ARE ACTUALLY THE M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; HARM TO ME.&lt;/c&gt;</u> TRY TO THINK ABOUT MAY PRICE AUTUMN AND ONE. AND NOT NECESSARILY ME THE FACT THAT INCOME PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS THEM ON THE BUT A CONTRADICTION ONE OF THE- IS IT TO. FOR TO SAY THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME. IN URBAN AREAS GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT THAT. SINGLE PASSENGER VEHICLE USE IS AT CAPACITY. IN OTHER WORDS IS THERE A DO WE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY- IN THE ROAD SYSTEM TO ABSORB. UGH AT ADDITIONAL SINGLES USE VEHICLE TRIPS THAT THAT VARIES ENORMOUSLY FROM PLACE TO PLACE ENORMOUSLY EVEN WITHIN BIG CITIES LIKE THE BEAR AND LA I MEAN WE'VE DONE AN ANALYSIS OF TRACK DELAYS. LA REGION FOR BOTH AND YET THE NET. MONTANA ON SERVICE STREETS THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD BUT IF FOR EXAMPLE THE ARC BETWEEN THE SANTA MONICA PIER IN DOWNTOWN. IS NOT ACTIVE PASSIVE IT'S WELL BEYOND CAPACITY AND SO THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW IN IN NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IT'S MOVING OUT OF PEAK PERIOD AND ALL DAY. THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPACTS BECAUSE IT SLOWS THE ABILITY TO MOVE TO VARIOUS. COURSE INVITE TAXES WILL BE PATIENTS PER MILE GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY EVEN. SELECT YOUR STILL CHIU THE CONSUMER MORE MILES IT IS CONGESTED I WENT IN AND RAN JERRY IT'S BAD FOR THE- BAD. THAT'S RIGHT. THEN DEFINITION IT. IF WE WERE FOCUS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND EFFORTS ON THOSE AREA WHERE THE CONGESTION IS GREATEST- I WOULD ASSUME THEN THAT WE ACHIEVE THE GREATEST VALUE. YEAH IN THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT. THE NET WITH THE FLOWS OUT OF THAT IS THAT LET'S TAKE THAT ARE BETWEEN DOWNTOWN IN SANTA MONICA OR WE COULD DO THE SAME THING FOR THE IN THE BAY AREA. THE NATURAL RESPONSE THIS IS. THERE'S ALL THIS TO GO ON RUSSIAN OF ACTIVITY. AND WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF TRAFFIC RESULT- SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO LIMIT THE INCREASE IN THE THAT THE- MORE ACTIVITY IN THAT AREA IN ORDER TO ALLOW THINGS TO WORK THERE WERE EVERYWHERE DRIVE ONTO A ROAD ANYTIME THEY WANT ANYWHERE THEY WANT. SO WE START WITH THAT IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE FIRST THE FIRST POSITION IS THAT EVERYONE CAN DRIVE ANYWHERE THEY WANT ANYTIME THEY WANT AND THEN WE'RE GONNA JUST THE FORM OF THE CITY TO FIT THAT. AND THAT. THE LEVEL WE HAVE. HIS BOB. ENGELS TO LAY. DEVELOP WAS BUILT A AREAS. WERE PUSHING DEVELOPMENT FARTHER OUT AND THAT'S WHERE THE BAY AREA WERE SEEING THESE INCREDIBLE INCREASES IN COMMUTE DISTANCE. EXAMPLE WHICH HAVE EVEN MORE PERNICIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL- IMPACT THOUGH. THE TO THE DENTIST. IN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR IN THOSE PLACES. THEY BECOME THOSE PLACES BEING THE DENSE DEVELOP PLACES THEY BECOME MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE TO ME. ON FOOT. AND BY. ON WEDNESDAY. MUCH EASIER TO GET AROUND BUT LONG AS THAT THIS. FILM CAR. WE IT OF THAT THE WAY OF ALL POSSIBLE OTHERS THAT CAN ASSIST RESPONSE EITHER WAS MANAGE THE PRIVATE VIA. OR WE SAY WE TO WREAK THIS A- THE FOR. POSITION EVERY INCH BILL TO DRIVE ANYWHERE THEY WANT ANYTIME THEY WANT AND I THINK THAT DISK A LOT OF THE DAY OF THE DEBATES WE HAVE. AREA IN LA YEAH. I WILL ARE ONE. A QUESTION IN OUR COLLEAGUES OPPORTUNITY TO. ASK YOU QUESTIONS. WE HAVE THE HIGHWAY PATROL HERE- TODAY TO A PRESENT TO US- LATER ON IN THEIR BUDGET ISSUES UP IS- HAVE HAVE YOU DONE RESEARCHER YOU'LL WEAR RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF THESE- AT CAPACITOR BEYOND CAPACITY STREETS. LAW AND- RESPONSE TIMES FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES. I HAVE NOT DONE RESEARCH ON THAT THERE IS RESEARCH ON THAT. AND I COULD REFER YOU TO I DO WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENT ON THAT THAT HERE I DO KNOW FROM THE ONE PIECE THAT I READ THESE QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO IS THAT. THE AVERAGE DID SAID THAT YOU NEED TO TRAVEL IN THOSE PLACES LIKE TO THINK OF IT IN A IN A DENSELY DEVELOPED AREA. THE AVERAGE DISTANCE TO HOSPITAL IS MUCH LOWER THAN IT WOULD BE AN KALANGA- SO THAT THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH THE A- A IS GOOD. YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT IN HEAVILY CONGESTED ROADS AND- IS THE VEHICLE. HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH BECAUSE PEOPLE PHYSICALLY CAN'T MOVE ASIDE BUT I'M GOOD AT I WOULD REFER YOU TO RESEARCH ON THAT RATHER THAN FLOOD OF COURSE IS A- FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN. URBAN AREAS VERSUS RURAL AREAS ONE OF THE- ASSUMED AMENITIES IS BEING CLOSER TO MANY SERVICES INCLUDING EMERGENCY SIR THROW. UP I THINK GUYS IN THERE I WOULD INTERESTED IN SEEING THAT RESEARCH IF YOU HAVE. TO GET TO ME. FOR I JUST A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF YOUR AT YOUR WORK YOUR RESEARCH- IN TERMS OF THE SURVEYS YOU DEVON PEOPLE WHO RIDE AND USE PUBLIC TRANSIT IS CONVENIENCE FACTOR AND GENDER THE RIDE HAILING RIDE SHARING- PLATFORMS- DO THE PUBLIC TRANSIT. OPERATIONS DO THEY NOW HAVE TO ADD. YOU KNOW CHANGE THE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE WAY THEY OPERATE IF AND I LISTEN BAKERSFIELD. THE OUR PUBLIC TRANSIT IS MOVING MORE YOU TRYING TO INSTEAD OF HAVING PEOPLE GO TO THE BUS STATION BUT- PICKING THEM THEM UP AND MOVING MORE OF A- A MOVING TOWARD MORE RIDE SHARING MODEL. WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU- WILL WILL WHICH IS COMMON SPEED SO. THERE'S A LOT OF REACH GENERAL STATUS OF IT HERE'S SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WHO. THE TRAIN THEN HOW ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE TRIP. ARE YOU HAPPY WITH REPUBLICANS EXPERIENCE IN THIS SORT OF MAKES SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A CAR AVAILABLE FOR THEIR TRIP. ARE OFTEN LET LESS HAPPY WITH IT IT'S IN ONE CASE SOMEONE HAD AN ALTERNATIVE. IS IN PUBLIC. IS THE FELT AN ALTERNATIVE TO THEIR TRIPS WERE THAT WOULD. THE HAVES. IN THIS IS. THAT IF. BUT NOT NOT STATISTICALLY RIGOROUS WORK BUT KIND OF FOCUS GROUP WORK THAT SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON TRANSIT A LOT BUT HAVE THE OPTION OF OCCASIONALLY TAKING A TNC TO BE MORE SATISFIED WITH THE TRANS AND AS AT VARIOUS POINTS MUCH I WAS COMPLETELY TRANCE. AND GREAT 42820% SOMETIMES IT WAS NOT SO CONVENIENT- YOU KNOW AT THE BUS STOP RUNNING- SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO WE COULD PROVIDE NICE COMPLIMENTARY SERVICE NOW THE OTHER THING THAT MENTIONED IS THAT AGAIN TRADITIONAL STREET FIX GET PUBLIC TRANSIT FACT IT PLACES WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE TRAVEL SECTION TIME. IS YEAH IT PROVIDE. WHERE WRITING THE SAME DIRECTION SAME TIME IN THOSE CASES VARIOUS KINDS OF PARATRANSIT WE USED TO SAY OR EVEN THESE KINDS OF SERVICES ABLE TO AT A LOWER PRICE PROVIDE HIGHER QUALITY SERVICE BUT THAT CAN OR- COULD YOU GET INTO AREAS WHERE THERE'S A HIGHER COUNTRY IN SCHOOL NEAR LIKE THAT. PUBLIC IT'S PAYING OFF ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SO WE CAN THINK OF IT IS PERHAPSTHE POTENTIAL FOR COMPLEMENTARY THIS. RIGHT BY ANY OTHER. A COUPLE OF OTHER- OF PRESENTERS WE HAVE THE TRANSIT AGENCY FOLKS HERE MON FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING. HIS. THIS PIMENTEL ANDERSON YOU'RE GONNA KICK US OFF YET THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR MICHAEL PIMENTEL DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA TRANSITION REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE- FOR HOSTING THIS TODAY. HOW WE WORK CLOSELY WITH COMMITTEE STAFF- TO ASSEMBLE A PANEL OF TRANSIT PROFESSIONALS ARE GOING TO SPEAK TO- THE VARIOUS EXTERNAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP THINGS A FACE DAY IN AND DAY OUT THAT MAKE IT HARD TO- BALZER TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IN THE- LIGHTS IN THE STRATEGIES. THAT THE DOING I TO THAT TO INCREASE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP WITHIN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORIES AGAIN JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC. AND MORE THE WISEST DIVERT. NATIONAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND BLUE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CONNIE CHUNG AND THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICER OVER SERVICE DEVELOPMENT. AT LOS ANGELES METRO. I JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT LA METRO IS THE THIRD LARGEST TRANSIT AGENCY IN THE COUNTRY. WE CARRY ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION. BOARDINGS USING OUR TWO THOUSAND BUSES AND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES OF RAIL LINES. AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO GROW WE HAVE ABOUT THREE MAJOR RAIL EXPANSION PROJECTS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. WE HAVE A LOT MORE TRANSIT PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE IS NOW. WE HAVE FIVE BEFORE I FROM SUCH AS TRANSIT WHICH IS MORE ON DEMAND. SOLUTION FIRST LAST MILE AND OTHER TYPES OF TRANSIT SO PORT OF PROGRAMS. UNFORTUNATELY AS A PROFESSOR TAYLOR MENTIONED ARE RIDERSHIP HAS BEEN DECLINING PASS TWO YEARS. WE SEE PROBABLY ABOUT IT FOR THE- SAN. THIS TIME. TEMPORE THAT WE OUGHT TO I WHAT THE FACTORS ARE BOTH INTERNAL EXTERNAL THEY'RE IMPACTING. AND HAD WE HAD THOSE. AND READING THROUGH A PROFESSOR TAYLOR'S WORK- THE ISSUE IS SPEED COMES UP A LOT- ESPECIALLY IN THE BAY AREA- ANALYSIS- FASTER TRAVEL TIMES MORE COMPETITIVE TRAVEL TIMES ARE ARE REALLY A KEY TO. THE SUCCESS OF TRANSIT AND THAT AND- WE HAVE A NEXT GEN BUS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM GOING ON RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE BUS NETWORK RESTRUCTURING IT TO BE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE WAY PEOPLE I WILL TODAY. AND THEN PUTTING THE TRANSIT US PART OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT AND A LOT OF PEACE OF THAT FOR STRUCTURE PROGRAM IS REALLY TO IMPROVE SPEED RELIABILITY A. K. A. BUS LANES- SIGNAL PRIORITY AND SO FORTH- WE FEEL THAT THAT'S A- COMPONENT. I SAID. AND ONE OF. A BUS ONLY IN FLOWER STREET BETWEEN DOT A. PEOPLE THAT FLOW THROUGH THAT COURT. SO THE BUSTLING WAS REALLY USEFUL IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THE OVERALL TRAVEL TIMES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BY AN AVERAGE OF FOURTEEN PERCENT. AND IN SOME SEGMENTS OF THE QUARTER WE ACTUALLY SAW AN INCREASE OR AN IMPROVEMENT IN SPEED. BY UP TO THIRTY PERCENT. AS WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT OUR MOSTLY NETWORK CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN MILES A BUS LANES WE'RE LOOKING AT A MEANT BEING. OUT A HUNDRED OVER A HUNDRED MILES OF US NEEDS THROUGH OUR- NEXT GEN BUT STUDY. AND A LARGER THAT THE SUCCESS IS REALLY THE ENFORCEMENT OF LANES. SO WE ARE SPONSORING BILL ASSEMBLY I A. B. A TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN AND IF YOU BUY TERM BLOOM PER OFFERING THAT. BUT ALL METRO TO WORK WITH. THEN THE OF LOS ANGELES TO IN AUTOMATED BUS LANE ENFORCEMENT. AND SO THAT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE SUCCESS OF BUS LANES I AND THE SUCCESS OF TRANSIT ITSELF. ANOTHER AREA OF IMPROVEMENT THAT WE SAW AND PROFESSOR TAILORED TOUCHED ON IT IS REALLY. A FREQUENCY. BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SHORT DISTANCE TRIPS. YOUR YOUR TIME ACCESSING THE BUS STOP OR WALKING A ROLLING TO THE BUS STOP. AND WAITING FOR THE BUS IT EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS YOUR MOM VEHICLE. TIMES PERCEIVED MORE OF YOUR TIME. ENTER YOUR AND TO AND TRIP. SO IMPROVING FREQUENCIES IS CRITICAL IN TERMS OF ATTRACTING PEOPLE OR MAKING TRANCE. COMPETITIVE AS THE FOR SHORT. THAT WILL. RESEARCH NOTED THAT ALMOST HALF. CENTER AT. IN LA COUNTY OF WHAT SO WHAT ARE YOUR TRANS OR WHAT NOT OVER HALF FOR ALMOST HALF OF THE ARE ONE AND FIVE MILES SO THE RELATIVELY SHORT- AND THE CHAIR AND GENTLY HAPPENED DURING THE MIDDLE OF DAY INTO THE EVENING AT PM PEAKS IN OUR WAY INTO THE WEEKENDS SO LARGE OF OUR NEXT STEP IS REALLY TO PROOF BUT SEE. OUT THE TODAY OF THE WEEK AND FOCUS THE- WHEN YOU WE CAN PUT OUT THERE ARE PART OF THE PAYMENT SO TO SPEAK TO PUT THAT FREQUENCY IS THROUGH SPEEDING UP THE BUS NETWORK BECAUSE WHEN YOU SPEED UP THE BUS NETWORK THAT BUS CAN MAKE MORE TRIPS OUR I CURRENTLY. TO JUST QUICK THE INFILL GRANDEST UP SNAPPLE WE INCREASE THE FOR WITH RICK RELATIVELY A VERY LITTLE ADDITIONAL- OFFER COST. NOW COMPARE PETTIT MRS ONE ASPECT BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS TRANSIT TO BE A VIABLE- TRAVEL OPTION BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE ATTRACTIVE TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT PEOPLE INTO TRANSIT. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAM WHEN I RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S R. OF WIFI ON BUSES A USB PORTS ON THE BUSES WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR BILL TIME AND PATIENCE. CRITICAL I BILL IS BECAUSE WE PEOPLE DON'T SEE THE BUS THERE WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THERE BUT THEY CAN GET ON THEIR APPS. AND SEE THAT THE BUSES COMING WITHIN TWO MINUTES A THREE THAT'S- EASY CONCERN HE HE IS. WE PROJECT FATHER IN THIS SECURITY A WATER VIEW AS WELL AS SIDEWALK AND ALSO WASTE TO IMPROVE FARE PAYMENT AS WELL NOW I KNOW PROFESSOR TAYLOR DID TALK ABOUT FREE FAIRS AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME. PROPOSALS ON THE FLOOR REGARDING FREE FAIRS WE HAVE SEEN THAT THAT HAS PROVEN TO INCREASE RIDERSHIP BUT WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS IN TERMS OF THOSE BILLS BECAUSE- AS PROFESSOR TAYLOR SAID WE DON'T WANT TO. MINIMIZE OUR REVENUES POINT THAT WE CAN PAYING OFF LEVELS. WE CAN WITH A TENER SINCE THE STATE A GOOD REPAIR SO WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH A WITH STATE LEGISLATORS. TO BE ABLE TO FIND SOLUTIONS WHETHER IT'S FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS TO- TO SUPPORT THE USE OF PROPOSALS OR OTHER MECHANISMS TO PROVE- AS A SERVICE FOR PEOPLE WITH GREATEST NEEDS. SO THEY CAN ACCESS OUR OPPORTUNITIES. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THIS MORNING I DO WANT TO. BRING YOU ATTENTION TO THIS- SHEET THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU HEY. HI THIS IS THE START OF A ONE JUROR TO PAY. ON OUR NEXT STEP BY STEP IN YOU CAN GET MORE INFORMATION- FROM THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH BOB.

AS THE SAN JOSE AIRPORT- INTO SANTA CRUZ DOWN TO BIG SUR A ONE FIFTH OF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MONTEREY SALINAS TRANSIT OPERATING AREA WELL THE SWEET NATURAL SOURCES THERE TO ABSOLUTELY SIR THE HOTTEST THING ON. OF THIS PEBBLE BEACH BY THE SEA AND OF THE LOWEST THING. AREAS OF THE STATE CENTER SOME LUCAS OF THE MIGRANT- FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES ALONG HIGHWAY ONE A ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND PRECIOUS COASTLINE IN THE WORLD NOT JUST THE STATE THANK YOU- THE ECONOMY OF MONTEREY COUNTY IS DRIVEN- GREATLY BY THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY FOR BILLION DOLLARS YEAR HOSPITALITY. THREE BILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR ANOTHER BILLION EACH BETWEEN EDUCATION CAL STATE UNIVERSITY MONTEREY BAY SEVERAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE NAVY POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL IN DEFENSE LANGUAGE INSTITUTE- ALSO- COMPRISE EDUCATION AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE- WE HAVE SEVERAL. FOR HER TO GET A CAMP ROBERTS AS WELL IT IS ONE OF THE FOUR PLACES TO LIVE IN THE COUNTY- THE ACT I. PURCHASED A CAR BOMB IT SOME GREATEST EITHER. ACCOUNT THAT HAS TO DO A LACK OF WHAT WE'RE NOT PART OF THE STATE WATER SO THERE IS NO NEW HOT THERE ARE NO NEW HOMES BEING BUILT ON. SOFT MANDATE THIS IS HOUSE WORK. FIVE PEOPLE. CHECK SHEETS TENDING BY CLEANING ROOM THEY CAN LONGER IN MODERATE LIVE OUT THE AREA SALIM I AND EVEN THE SELENA VALLEY WE HAVE THE SOME OF THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGES OF PER CAPITA OF US UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AS WELL AS HOMELESS IN MODERN ANY- NO LOCAL TAX FOR FIXED ROUTE PUBLIC TRANSIT WITHIN OUR COUNTY WE DO HAVE A SMALL LOCAL STACKS FOR EIGHTY EIGHT. SERVICES BUT ARE STILL COMPLETELY ENDED ON FEDERAL AND PDA FINANCED- TO RUN OUR LOCAL. EXTRA TRANSIT INTO A NUMBER OF PARTNERSHIP THAT I WILL SPEAK TO LATER- WE NOTICED- COMPARABLE TO THAT OF TESTIMONY JUST HER MISTER TAYLOR. UNDERSHIRT PETE WRECKED THE RECESSION STARTED THE OVEN AFTER THE RECESSION WE NOTICED A RIDERSHIP WAS NOT REBOUNDING ALONG WITH THE ECONOMY AND PRIOR TO THAT YOU COULD JUST TRACK ARE RIDERSHIP- TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS- AS EMPLOYMENT WENT UP RIDERSHIP WHEN I. WAS NO LONGER HAPPENING SO STARTED TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT A LACK OF WILL HOUSING HAD PUSHED THE- INCOME RIGHT. THE FIRST OF SELLING AND MY- OUT IN THE MORE REAL OTHER WEATHER WAS LAST AND NOTE AVAIL AND EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE SOME OF MY OWN EMPLOYEES- COMMUTING FROM LOS BANOS SAM JOAQUIN COUNTY OVER THE CHECK UP THE COMING BURKE. I IN MY- NICE. BUT I'M NOT SURE I'D WANT TO DO IT EVERY DAY- SO INCREASED ACCESS THE CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE THROUGH AB SIXTY WITH A HIGH NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS- YOU SAW. PRIOR TO THAT BOTTOM 1% GROWTH. IN DRIVER'S LICENSE ISSUED ONLY ARE WITHIN THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER- THAT LAW WAS PASSED WE SAW DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES FIFTY. PERCENT INCREASES AND NOT THAT STABLE OUT 223% GROWTH. EACH YEAR NEW DRIVER'S LICENSE WE'VE INCREASED THE NOT EVERS. THE SHIP. FINING I HAD EXCEPT KERR I THINK THAT WAS BORN THE STATE JUST HEARD OUR PREVIOUSLY SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTY SO WHAT SALINAS TRANSIT. OF SINCE WE COULD ALL DEPEND ON OUR TRIP. LOW INCOME RIDER WE HONOR SHIPS ARM WITH OUR UNIVERSITIES COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE- WHERE THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROVIDING MORE FUNDING TO US AND WE BRING IN AND FAIRS OFF FROM PASSENGER SPECIAL FORCES. THAT MAKE THE SERVICE IS FREE. OUR STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF JURORS ARE IN THE CASE THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM IN THE CITY OF MONTEREY THEY FUND A 100% OF OUR COSTS TO PROVIDE FREE SERVICE- CANNERY ROW IN TROLLEY VEHICLES ACTUALLY ON THE CHARLIE VEHICLES THEM STE. I GROWTH. FREE TO PASSENGERS HAS HAS ACTUALLY- OFFSET OUR LOSSES AND YOU YOU'LL SEE IF YOU'LL JUST LOOK AT OUR TOTAL RIDERSHIP IT HAS GROWN SLIGHTLY OR IT'S FLATTENED OUT OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN IN XIN RIDERSHIP THIS PAST YEAR DO YOU ARE IT THE LADY TO. I HIGHER DRIVE. ARE BUS DRIVER NOT A POSITION THAT YOU PEOPLE TO A TO APPLY THE TYPE OF OURS TYPE OF WORK THAT YOU DO- THE WORKING CONDITIONS- THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE FOR THEIR FACED WITH EVERY DAY DEALING WITH THAT OUR PUBLIC STREETS AS YOU ALL KNOW IS THE CONVERGENCE OF OUR STATES MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS OPIOID CRISIS. PORTABLE HOUSING CRISIS. TRANSIT AND OUR DRIVERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THAT AND- IT'S JUST NOT ACTIVELY JOB WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO CUT BACK SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY DUE TO A LACK OF DRIVERS AND THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ALONG THIS BROWN'S AROUND CUT OFF IF DINNER QUESTION DOES THAT. HOUSE ALSO A PLAN TO YEAH I AM YEAH WE LOSING WE'RE LOSING. MECHANICS IT'S A LITTLE EASIER FOR THEM TO PICK UP THE TOOL BOX AND GO TO ANOTHER STATE IN THE TECH THERE'S WITH THEM BUT DRIVERS. WHAT WERE WE'RE- DONE. RUMORS ARE READ AT A VERY PACE AND WE ARE I HAVING TROUBLE REPLACING THEM WITH MILLENNIALS. SO WE HAVE OUR RECENTLY DONE SOME FREE FAIR- EXPERIMENTS TO GROW WRITER WE USING OUR LC TOP LOW CARBON TRANSIT OPERATIONS PROGRAM FUNDS ARE AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME RESULTS OF THAT- WE DID FREE FAIRS WEEKENDS ALL THE- SO. LETTER COMMUNITY WITHIN OUR AREA QUALIFIES FOR THE USE OF THESE TYPES OF FUNDS- WHAT HAPPENED ON THE WEEKENDS WAS FIXED ROUTE RIDERSHIP DOUBLED. WHICH WAS GREAT AND WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS RELATIVE. LOW RIDERSHIP ON THE WEEKENDS ANYWAY SO WE'RE ABLE TO EXPAND THAT WE HAD A 20% INCREASE. OUR FEDERALLY MANDATED EIGHTY A SERVICES AT ALL THIS CORRECT MISTER TAYLOR'S TESTIMONY- WORRY SAID THE HIGHEST SUBSIDY- TRIPS ARE LONG DISTANCE COMMUTER ROUTES THAT'S TRUE FOR FIXED ROUTE SERVICES BUT FOR TRANSIT OPERATOR WHO HAS TO READ- COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW. YOUR EIGHTY EVERY SAYS ARE FAR THE MOST WE SUBSIDIZE VERSES AND WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO TURN THOSE TRIPS DOWN WE HAVE SET REACHED AN FOR. PARKS EVEN CAN OUR DROUGHT SERVICES SO ALTHOUGH I WE RUN RISK OF LOSING. EIGHTY TWENTY PER THE WEEK. ARM BASED ON THAT SUCCESS WE WORKED OUT A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND HAD SEVERAL CAN'T COUPLE CAMPUSES IN SALINAS HARTNELL COLLEGE- ANOTHER CAMPUS AND SINKING SKI IN SOUTH COUNTY WHERE THEY WERE ALL THE SEPARATING THEMSELVES TO RECEIVE A HALF DISCOUNT HALF FARE DISCOUNTED FOR WE TOOK THAT TO A FAIR. ANY HARTNELL COLLEGE THE WITH THE ID RIDE ANYWHERE ON MST SERVICE AT ANY TIME. ARE JUST BETWEEN AUGUST AND JANUARY OF THIS YEAR COMPARING THAT THE AUGUST IN JANUARY OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR A TEN FOLD INCREASE. IN FIXED ROUTE RIDERSHIP MATCHED BY A TEN FOLD INCREASE IN THE EIGHTY A RIDERSHIP. WE ARE HAVING TO ADD DRIVERS ADD BUSES FOR SAFETY CONDITIONS STANDING ROOM ONLY ALONG THE HIGHWAY HIGHWAY ONE A ONE GOING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. IT'S A SAFETY. WE DON'T HAVE THE CALL. OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT- AS WELL SO. SERVICE IS GREAT NOW WE'RE HAVING TO RENEGOTIATE THIS CONTRACT WITH HARTNELL BECAUSE WE WERE TOO SUCCESSFUL- WITH THAT AND SO- IT'S ULTIMATELY UNSUSTAINABLE AT THIS POINT AND WE ARE AT WAR SO WE'RE LOOKING TO RENEGOTIATE WITH THE BUS DRIVER SHORTAGE IT'S CALLED UP- TO KEEP UP WITH. UP OF GROWTH- SO. THAT A IT'S THE EIGHTY A SERVICES THAT ARE THE REAL CONCERN FOR OUR OPERATION WITH REGARD TO OFFERING FREE SERVICES- OVER HALF OF OUR EIGHTY EIGHT TRIPS ARE MADE BY PERSONS UNDER EIGHTEEN AND OVER FIFTY FIVE- IN OUR COMPANY THEY'RE MOSTLY GOING TO DIALYSIS- SERVICES AND THE ELDERLY ARE GOING TO ADULT. ALZHEIMER DAY CARE SERVICES- OUR COMMUNITY SURVEYS- SUPPORT WHAT WAS RECENT RECENTLY TESTIFIED TO MORE NON WRITERS PEOPLE WHO DON'T CURRENTLY RIDE THE BUS WILL SAY THEY WILL CONSIDER. AND WILL RIDE THE BUS IF WE CAN MAKE IT FASTER. IF WE CAN BE MORE FREQUENT. AND ONE WAY WE CAN DO THAT IN MONTEREY COUNTY WE HAVE NO HOV LANES WE HAVE EIGHT MILLION VISITOR TRIPS PER YEAR TO A COMMUNITY OF A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ON THE- PENINSULA- AND THEN ANOTHER A- HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SALINAS VALLEY WE HAVE UP ALMOST TWO THOUSAND AGRICULTURE. SLEEPER A ALL ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY TWO LANE HIGHWAY- WE'RE TYING TO BUILD THE BUSWAY ALONG HIGHWAY ONE WERE TRAFFIC IN THE MORNINGS BECAUSE WHEN I HAD FILES PROP. PRIEST ARE YOU SEE. UP WE'RE BUILDING THIS BUS LINE USING A HOPEFULLY USING T. I. R. C. P. FUNDS. CAP AND TRADE FUNDS AND SOME FEDERAL FUNDS. HOWEVER WE'RE STUCK IN A VERY LONG ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS- THAT WOULD BE THE SAME AS IF I WAS BUILDING A LANE FOR CARS- BUILDING PROJECT THAT WILL REDUCE VMT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO MILLION MILES PER YEAR- AND SAVE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND TONS OF CO TWO. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD FIND SOME WAY FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS IN REDUCE VMT THAT WE CAN FIND SOME WAY TO EXPEDITE. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW SILLY WE CAN BUILD THESE PROJECTS FASTER. AND GET THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESULTS WE WANT AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY AND MONTEREY COUNTY AGREES WITH ME. SO WE WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I AM ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO HELP BUILD THESE PROJECTS FASTER WHAT'S THE- ESTIMATED TIME AND FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL TERM YEARS. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE COMMISSION OKAY PARKS WHICH DOESN'T. IT'S ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF HIGHWAY ONE IN AN ABANDONED REAL QUARTER THAT HAS BEEN USED FOR SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY- IT'S DISTURBED RAIL PROPERTY THAT WE JUST WANT TO PAY EVEN GO OUT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY ONE TRAFFIC. I'M INTERESTED. THAT CONCLUDES MY TEST MIGHT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ARE MOVING ALONG THANK YOU VERY AND LASTING- WHEN WE MOVE TO THE NEXT SPEAKER OF IN WRITING COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING US THIS MORNING MY NAME IS CLARK GABLE GOES I SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS COMMUNITY RELATIONS AC TRANSIT ARE WE'RE HEADQUARTERED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA IF EACH HAS SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. WHERE THEY EASE IS LARGE THE PROVIDER THE TRANSIT. OWNED BY THE- OF THE BAY IS GOVERNED BY A SEVEN MEMBER PUBLICLY ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE AGENCY WAS CREATED AS A SPECIAL DISTRICT BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. IN NINETEEN SIXTY. AYE WE SERVE I TO COUNTIES PORTIONS OF ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA. SERVING THIRTEEN CITIES AND INCORPORATED AREAS I FROM SAN PABLO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SOUTH SOUTH FREMONT- WE OPERATE A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE BUS LINES OVER A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR SQUARE MILE SERVICE AREA. IN ANNUAL IS PROVIDE UP FOR FIFTY THREE MILLION A RIGHTS AVERAGING ABOUT. A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND- WEEK A I. EIGHTY TRANSIT INTO NINETEEN AND EIGHTEEN ARE WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A VARIETY OF IT INITIATIVES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE QUALITY OF OUR OF OUR SERVICE. I RESULTING IN RIDERSHIP INCREASES OR AGENCY DURING A PERIOD. DURING WHICH NATIONAL NATIONALLY THE PUBLIC TRANSIT INDUSTRY FAR RIDERSHIP DECLINES AS AS IF YOU'VE AS YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING THIS MORNING. IT TWENTY NINETEEN AC TRANSIT SYSTEM WHAT RIDERSHIP HIT OVER FIFTY THREE MILLION REFLECTING A TWO POINT 5% INCREASE OVER TWENTY EIGHTEEN RIDERSHIP FIGURES. ARE TRANSBAY SERVICE WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS MORNING WHICH CARRIES WRITERS ACROSS THE THREE BAY AREA BRIDGES SIDE A FIVE POINT 8% INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP YEAR OVER YEAR. SOME THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE TRIBUTE TO OUR- RIGHT SHIP INCREASES. NUMBER ONE SIGN INFUSION. OF SALES TAX DOLLARS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AFTER ALAMEDA COUNTY VOTED TAX CELL. AND WE- TOOK A RISK SHOP WORK INCREASE REQUEST IS IMPLEMENTED ARE. OUR GET STARTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE START TO SEE POSITIVE. GENERAL IS IT AND UBER. IN DOUBLE THE BUSES WHICH YOU WILL SEE. ALONG THE EIGHTY OR CROSS THE BAY INTO FRANCISCO WE TRY IT WE INTRODUCED INTO OUR FLEET IN DECEMBER ON THREE LINES THOSE THREE LINES ALONE. TWO OF THEM SAW INCREASES IN A ONE YEAR OF 24% ONE LINE 530% INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP IN THAT WAY SINGLE YEAR. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER A SEAT THAT IS GOVERNED BY PUBLICLY ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS WE ARE ONLY ONE OF THREE TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THAT IS- THAT HAS A PUBLICLY ELECTED BOARD WHICH MAKES IS UNIQUE IN A COUPLE OF WAYS FIRST BECAUSE OUR BOARD IS DIRECTLY ELECTED BY THE VOTERS ARE BOARD MEMBERS HAVE ONLY ONE VERY SPECIFIC BOB AND THAT IS. PRESENT CONSTITUENTS ON OUR TRANSIT BOARD THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST AND THE AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRY ARE TYPICALLY COMPRISED OF BOARD MEMBERS ELECTED AS COUNTY SUPERVISOR MAYOR COUNCILMEMBERS. THEN APPOINTED TO SIT ON THE BORDER LOOK WHICH IS AGENCIES WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US IS THAT DECISIONS THAT IMPACT US. SUCH AS LAND USE DECISIONS ARE DECISION STARTING LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS SUCH AS ELIMINATING LANES ADDING SIX NORTH BY PLANE. BURKE THIS IS IN TERM BECOME LEADER FOR. OF. SHOW THE RIGHT AWAY THESE DECISIONS- THROUGHOUT THIRTEEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. I'M IMPACT OUR SERVICE RELIABILITY AND ULTIMATELY- HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR RIDERSHIP. WE HAD A FEW TRAINS THERE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE RECEIVED A SMALL STARTS GRANT AGREEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION WHICH COUPLED WITH OVER FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING AND REGIONAL FINDS OUT WE ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION ON OUR FIRST ON OUR FIRST BUS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM- THE EAST BABY OUR TEAM. WE EXPECT TO OPEN THE SYSTEM TO THE PUBLIC IN THIS. YEAR I BRT PROP SO OFTEN DESCRIBED AS LIGHT RAIL ON WHEELS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DELIVER THE FREQUENCY AND RELIABILITY A LIGHT REAL PROSPECT AT A FRACTION OF THE COST 80% OF OUR BY SYSTEM OF OUR THIRTY SYSTEM WILL OPERATE WITHIN A DEDICATED BUS ONLY LANE. OUR PROJECT PRESENTE TO IT AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES OF OAKLAND AND SAN LEANDRO. AND WHILE IT'S ONLY NINE AND A HALF MILES IT IS GOVERNED BY THREE. DIFFERENT BODIES THE CITY OF OAKLAND THE CITY OF SAN LEANDRO AND CALTRANS BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR CORD OR RUNS THE COUCH. TO WAIT. I'M WE ARE A GREAT TRAFFIC SIGNALS NONE OF WHICH ARE OWNED BY US- WHICH ARE GOING TO BE EQUIPPED WITH TRANSITIONAL PRIORITY WHICH WILL ESPECIALLY. GIVE BUSES PRIORITY BY ALLOW TRACK YOU KNOW TO REAP REAPING GREEN OF YOUR TICKETS WITH SECOND THE SYSTEM DETECTS THAT BUSES WITH THE RANGE. OVERALL ARE I'M INCLUDES. STATIONS THAT WILL BE SIR NEW. ELECTRIC LOW GEN BY. WE ARE. OFFERING NEW SIR TO OUR WRITERS LIVE. FREE IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS. HAS OVER TWENTY YEARS TO GET TO THIS POINT FROM NINETEEN NINETY NINE TO TWO THOUSAND ONE EIGHTY TRANSIT GATHERED COMMUNITY INPUT ON HOW AND WHERE TWO. MEN TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. THIS PARTICULAR CORRIDOR WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGH RIDERSHIP AND HIGH CONTROL RIDERSHIP INCREASES. WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED AS OVER FIFTEEN MILES SYSTEM BETWEEN SAN LEANDRO OAKLAND AND BERKELEY WAS REDUCED TO THE CURRENT ALIGNMENT ACT FAST TO GAIN APPROVAL ON THE BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL. PRIMARILY DUE TO FEARS OF KING REDUCTIONS AND PUSHED BACK ON THE NOTION OF GIVING UP A VEHICLE TRAVEL INTO BY THIS. THE BUT PUSH BACK AGAINST PARK LIMóN IT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO HAVE. STOPPED SHORT OF CITY. AND WHILE WE'RE STILL FORWARD. I WITH OUR PART AGAIN SAN LEANDRO CALTRANS AND ASK IT'S A VERY COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPETING INTERESTS THAT REQUIRE STRONG COMMITMENTS FROM EVERY EVERYONE I IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PROJECT MOVING. IN OAKLAND WHICH IS HOME TO A HALF OF OUR FUNDS IN OFTEN OUR SYSTEM ARE THEY HAVE A NEWLY ESTABLISHED DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION WITHIN THE CITY I THEIR LEADING AN EFFORT TO INSTALL BUS ONLY LANES IN THE CORE OF DOWNTOWN. AND ONE SECTION OF THE BUS ONLY LANES FOR OUR B. R. SYSTEMS OPERATE AND WE ESTIMATE A TRAVEL SAVINGS OF ABOUT 30% AND 20% PROJECT AND I. IN RELIABILITY THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN TAKE STEPS TO HELP IMPROVE TRANSIT RELIABILITY AND PERFORMANCE AND ULTIMATELY HELPED INCREASE RIDERSHIP. AT EIGHTY TRANSIT WE HAD A STAFF LEVEL WELL AS TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS WORK WITH OUR LOCAL. TO ENSURE THEIR DECISION THE ULTIMATE HAVE A IMPACT I TRIED SERVICE WE PROVIDE. NOW A BIT OF THE- TONY. THERE'S A VISOR DO I OR THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE A DIRECT AND ON OUR LET USE DECISION RIGHT AWAY JUST PARKING LANES BUSTLING ARE ALL THIS IS BY LOW ME THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT THE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICE WHICH AT THE END OF THE DAY DRIVES RIDERSHIP UP OR DOWN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. IT EVEN ALL THE INFORMATION THE CHALLENGES THAT TO THE FAA SAYS AGENCIES- WITH- A VERY- VERY TO RAIN AND RIDERS AT THE THAT THE THAT YOU SERVE PUBLIC THAT YOU SERVE. OF MISTER MARK. HE WAS SURE THANK YOU ALL FOR THE PRESENTATION OF MR TRYING YOU USE THE PHRASE SPEED UP THE BUS NETWORK AS BEING CRUCIAL TO ALL OF OUR EFFORTS CYBER ASSUMING YOU'RE TALKING A FISSION SEES LIKE ELECTRIFIED. B. R. T. STOP START. TIMES DEDICATED LANES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HE JUST EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON. ON YOUR THINKING AS ON HOW WE ACTUALLY SPEED UP THAT NETWORK SURE YEAH. IT'S SPEEDING UP THE NETWORK IN TERMS OF TOTAL TRAVEL TIME SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR TRIP YOU'RE LEAVING YOUR FRONT DOOR YEAR WALKING OR ROLLING TO A BUS STOP YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE BUS GETTING ON THE BUS AND YOU'RE MOVING. AND SO IN ALL ELEMENTS OF THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO. REDUCE BARRIERS TO IT THOSE OF THE STEPS OF YOUR TRIP AS IT RELATES TO BEING ON THE VEHICLE I DEFINITELY. HAVE OUR- PROGRAM. OUR IS BANDS BE BY THIRTY NOW WE ARE GOING IMPLEMENT FIRST ZB DEPLOY ON A ORANGE LINE PURITY PROJECT BECAUSE THERE ARE SYNERGY BETWEEN. ELECTRIC BUS- RANGE AND- THE ABILITY TO- TO KIND EXTEND THE AMOUNT OF YOUR TRAVEL THE BUSCA MAY WITHIN THE- BATTERY- I CAPACITY- AND THE SPEED OF THE BILL AS WELL SO WE ARE WORKING ON- ELECTRIFYING THE WAR SO I FOR OF THE SILVER LINE WHICH IS PROJECTS IT'S SORT OF A HYBRID RT AT OF THE SECOND AND THEN MOVING ON TO OUR TYRAEL SO- WHAT WE'RE ALSO DOING IS. THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN ONLY AT THIS THE BOSTON WERE IMPLEMENTING BOARDING WE'VE AND THAT I WE HAVE AN ORANGE LINE BUT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THAT ON THE SILVER LINE ARE SEVEN TWENTY ON ON WILSHIRE CORRIDOR% AND THE SEVEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH IS OUR VERMONT QUARTER RAPID THOSE ARE THE DO. DOORS WE GENERATE. THINGS ARE THIRTY SEVEN THAT BRINGS A DAY AND BY IMPLEMENTING BORE YOUR LAW PEOPLE TO GET IN THE BUS AT ALL DOORS AND THAT'S OF MINIMIZES THE TWELVE I AM AT YOUR STOPS ROSS AND IT'S A STRAIGHT UP MY SORT OF RATIONAL STOPS PACING SERVICE THERE'S A OF THINGS COULD DO IN BUT REALLY THE BIG PUSH ON HIM. SPEAK IS WORKING WITH THE LOCAL JR AMAZON THE BUS LANES TRANSISTOR PRIOR YOU KNOW CHIU JUMPERS AND ALL OF THOSE FANCY THINGS. FOR SOCIAL. WITH THE MS THE RIVER OF ALL BY MY WHERE HIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR AND I A MEMBER FROM THE SENATE VALLEY- SO LA METRO- AND- YOU MENTIONED- PROPOSALS FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT OFFER FREE RIDERSHIP IN SOME FORM FOR TO ASSERT POPULATION IN MY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUTH. THE KNOW THE RIDERSHIP FOR YOUTH YOU KNOW I THINK IF WE GET THEM WRITING EARLY AS YOUNG PEOPLE AND- THEN THEY'LL INCREASE THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUING- TO BE A- YOU KNOW TO USE PUBLIC TRANSIT- AND I WAS WONDERING IF ELEMENT. HAS A PLAN FOR THAT ARE NOT SURE WHAT YOU CURRENTLY OFFER YEAH I MEAN WE ACTUALLY OFFER DISCOUNTS ON OUR ON OUR AFFAIRS- IF YOU LOOK AT OUR OUR SO STAND FAIR THE AVERAGE. YOU'LL FAIR TO A DOG SEVENTY FIVE YEAH BUT OUR AVERAGE FARES DOWN PROBABLY SIX FIVE SENSORS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DISCOUNTED FARES OUT THERE FOR SENIORS DISABLED- STUDENTS- HIGH SCHOOL KIDS AND UNDER AND SO FORTH AND THEN ALSO COLLEGE- IT STUDENTS AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOL THE CURRENTLY STUDENTS HAVE TO PAY. I SOME. YEAH THE DO PAY THERE WAS AT DISCUSSION AT OUR RECENT BOARD MEETING THE TALKED ABOUT INTO FREE FARES FOR STUDENTS- THAT ARE OF THE GREATEST NEED IT'S THE LOWER INCOME AND SO FORTH- WE ARE STUDY RIGHT NOW TO SEE SIR HOW WE PRIORITIZE THE DIFFERENT CONSTITUENT ARE RELATIVE TO I WAS MEDIAN HIS HIS LAST. I'M AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING OUT THAT WOULD DO IN TERMS OF IMPACT OUR THE TO PROVIDE SERVICE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM AND SO FORTH. OKAY THANK YOU SURE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IT THE ENTIRE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING IS SO TIMELY- THE LEGISLATIVE LATINO CAUCUS JUST HAD THEIR POLICY RETREAT. AND ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD WAS THE FACT THAT. OFTENTIMES ARE TALKING ABOUT JUNE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BUT MANY MANY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN TWO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT. TRANSIT WE'VE TO TALK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TRANSIT WE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET MORE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS AND INTO THE SYSTEMS. I UNDERSTAND THAT TODAY IS OF INFORMATIONAL AND- AND I APPRECIATE THAT MOST EVERYBODY IS FROM LOS ANGELES OR THE BAY AREA. I DID HEAR ONE COMMENT ABOUT FONTANA EARLIER AND I APPRECIATED THAT- I'M FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE BIGGER CHALLENGES- BUT- MY QUESTION IS. WHAT WHAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTATION LOOKED LIKE DO WE HAVE A TEN YEAR PLAN A WE ALREADY LOOKING AT WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD GOING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR- THE SINGLE WRITER- ATTITUDE- THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO FIND AT FIND WAYS TO TAKE. TRANSPORTATION EDIT MY COLLEAGUE IS THERE IS LESS SOLUTION NOW US MEMBER GONZALEZ INTRODUCED LET'S JUST GEN SO THAT STUDENTS WOULD FREE. AGAIN WHO REACH AND- A WRITER SO TO SPEAK BUT WHO WERE- WHERE ARE WE ON A PLAN- SO THAT WE CAN IT THE WE KNOW WE NEED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. WE KNOW THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS A PERFECT WAY TO DO THAT. AND WILL BE SO WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL IDEAS BUT AS A STATE. WHERE ARE WE ON PLANTS ARE WORKING WITH THE ON PLANTS. HELLO I FEEL WE HAVE A SAYING IN OUR INDUSTRY WHEN YOU'VE SEEN ONE PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATOR YOU'VE SEEN ONE PUBLIC TRANSIT OPERATOR BECAUSE THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SO UNIQUE I I'M FROM BOB REPRESENTING MONTEREY SALINAS TRANSMITTER COUNTY A GRADUATE OF REDLANDS HIGH. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE SPELL I LIVED FOR QUITE AWHILE SAN FERNANDO STATES I KNOW VERY. MUCH THE ISSUES THAT YOU BASE THEIR. AND I'D SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE COME YOUNG CAL IS THE ENVY OF MANY OTHER STATES WITH SOME OF OUR SALES PROGRAM THAT THE TRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT ACT. AND THEN THE S. ONE FUNDING THAT CAME STATES- THERE ARE PROGRAMS- AT THE STATE LEVEL THE CALIFORNIA GRATED TRAVEL- PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT UP WITH SINGLE. THANGAL IMAGE THAT YOU. THIS CROSS A BE A EXCEPT BY TRADE OPERATORS LIKE YOU AND ALL YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT CARD TO STOP AT DIFFERENT TO A- FIRST. ALL RIGHT WHY DON'T WE HAVE A SINGLE CARD YOU CAN CAN USE ON A SINGLE- TRANSIT OPERATOR SO MAKING THE PAYMENT ACCESSIBLE AND RE LOW BALL- NOTE LOADED ON YOUR PHONE AND GO SOUTH THERE ARE. PLANS BEING FROM THE BACK BUT- JEFF WHAT WE CALL EACH. IS DRIVEN BY LOCAL LAND USE PLANNING DECISIONS THAT IN SOME CASES WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AS THE OPERATOR OUR SELF YEAH WE CAN COMMENT ON THE INVITE ALL. ASPECT THAT WE CAN COMMENT AT PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT ULTIMATELY- OFTENTIMES WERE SHOOT FORMED IN. AFTER THE FACT WHEN MAYBE THE DESIGN DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED SO THERE STE WE HAVE MANY GOOD TEMPLATE. FUNDING AND PERSPECTIVE WERE THE WHERE THE- OTHER STATES BUT WE ARE ON TO GO. AS FOR AS CORPS. TRAVEL THROUGHOUT REGIONS- AND THAT THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY THAT I THINK- EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ALL SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- WHAT SHE HERE ESPECIALLY FROM US AND FROM PROFESSOR TAYLOR AND HIS COLLEAGUES IS THAT THERE ARE OTHER STRATEGIES. A SIMILAR WE'RE TRYING TAKE A SEAT THROUGH THEIR HOPES RESTRUCTURE STUDY REALIGN THE HOUSE WITH YOU KNOW THE WAY PEOPLE TRAVEL TODAY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO. THE NET GEN AND A I THINK THE FIRST ORDER REALLY TO GET THE NETWORK HELLO OF US HAVE LOOKED AT OUR NETWORK IN LAW TIME IT'S THEN WE'VE HAD YOU DIFFERENT. BEFORE OUT NOW REALLY TRAVELING AND MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY ANYMORE AND WE NEED BE SURE THAT ACCOUNTING FOR THAT IF NOT WE'RE MAY ALIGNING ARE SIR WITH WITH THE TRAVEL PACK THAT THAT EXISTS TODAY SO ONCE RESET YOUR SIX A LOT OF US ARE IN TO THESE STOP TO SPEEDING UP. ASPEN RELY. KEY UP FOR OUR CITY. AND WE GO ABOUT IT IN IN SLIGHTLY WAYS. BUT YOU TALK TO A OF OUR UNIQUE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE AND THEY ALL SAY. FIVE ALL YOU KNOW DOESN'T MATTER. TO BEYOND THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. OKAY AND WHEN YOU GET BEYOND THE FASTER CAR RELIABLE YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE- CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES IS NICE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE I THINK. MISTER TAYLOR THE QUALITY OF RIDE- ZERO MISSION BUSES ONE THING AGAIN PUTTING AMENITIES- ON YOUR BUSES BUS STOPS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ACCESS. NETWORK ITSELF AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE FEEL SAFE SECURE COMFORTABLE- ON ON THE VEHICLES IS REALLY CRITICAL AHEAD HE IN THE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS TO SEE DO YOUR DO YOUR ROUTES MATCHER POPULATION SHIFTS HAVE HAVE EMPLOYMENT CENTERS CHANGED OR- LOW INCOME HOUSING OR JUST WHAT WHERE PEOPLE LIVING IN WHERE THEY TROUBLING TO. AND SIDES. TO GROW SERVICE BUT REALIGNING YOUR SERVICES I'D WE'VE SEEN MUCH SUCCESS AND SAN DIEGO MTS IS GROWING RIDERSHIP SIMPLY BY REALIGNING THEIR SERVICES AND I BELIEVE IN- CENTRAL COUNTRY THE COUNTY- CONCORD AREA THEY'VE ALSO SEEN RECENT RIDERSHIP GROWTH JUST BY DOING THIS THE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW BUT I'M IN TODAY I BELIEVE WE'RE ALL GOOD IT'S PROCESSING NOW. WE HAVE ACCESS TO NEW TO NEW DATA USING DATA DATA GENERATED BY CELLPHONE USERS THAT- MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR US TO IDENTIFY SHIFTS AND TRAVEL PATTERNS AND WILL BE SAYING THAT. IN ADDITION TO FAIR DISCOUNT PROGRAMS- IN MONTEREY WE'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY WANT TO PURCHASE DEEPLY DISCOUNTED PASTORS AND WE WILL DO THAT FOR THEM- THE DIFFICULTY WITH FREE AS IF IT'S NOT BEING PAID FROM STE. ARE YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NOT REAL DOT ARE USED MAKE A ROLL BY QUICK AND- SO WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE BUS AND PAVE THE DRIVERS AND IF WE TAKE THE FAIRS AWAY. AND IT'S NOT COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE- WE NEED TO FIGHT WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT UP FOR. WE DON'T ANYBODY TO OKAY TO DO IT FREE THAT TOO WE'RE NOT INVOLVED HAVE A QUESTION IF I MAY THIS WOULD CAUSE. EASY TRANSIT WAS CREATED THROUGH LEGISLATION OR HOW WAS IT CREATED CORRECT WHERE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICT. OKAY VERY GOOD IN THE MY LAST QUESTION I STEPPED OUT TO MEET WITH SOME PEOPLE FROM I. T. AND- MUSIC YEAH. HEARING AND WHAT THAT WAS MADE IS. WE USED TO HAVE SCHOOL BUSES. AND NOW WE'VE TAKEN AWAY THE SCHOOL BUSES BECAUSE OF. A PROBLEMS WITH WITH WITH FUNDING. SO NOW YOU HAVE ALL THESE PARENTS NOW GETTING IN THE CAR- DRIVING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. IS THAT THE LINES ARE LONG WHILE THERE YOU TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN OUT- OF. WHEN SCHOOL IS ARE NOW ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES WHAT ARE YOU THOUGHTS ON GOING BACK. NURSE BUSES. SO I CAN I CAN SPEAK TO THAT EASY TRANSIT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY ROBUST- SCHOOL A SERVICE IT'S NOT- DEDICATED SCHOOL SERVICE BECAUSE BY FOR ALL REGULATIONS I THAT IS NOT ALLOWED IT WOULD BE CONCERT CHARTER SERVICE WHAT WE- TAKE OUR- STATE. THIS I AYE AYE WORKERS. IN BASICALLY THE EAST TO SAN FRANCISCO AND THEN THOSE BUSES TURN AROUND AND THEY PICK KIDS AND TAKE TO SCHOOL I'M SO.

SO WHAT YOU KNOW ONCE WE ONCE WE ARE HIRED ADDITIONAL STAFF WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT ADDITIONAL STAFF TO WILL BE ABLE TO DEDICATE THEIR TIME- TO THIS ISSUE A LITTLE BIT MORE- A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY WERE SEEMS UP SOME VERY DRASTIC INCREASES THE YOU MAY YOU MAY- ON THE FRONT. OUR OVERALL SAFETY NUMBERS ARE THAT WE SEE- ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED- FATALE HE'S- ON OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK AND IF COP I COME TO USING THE TRUCK PATIENTS. AND ROUGHLY TO THREE- OF THOSE BUT WHAT ALSO IT IS TEN A DAY IS THE NUMBER IS ROUGHLY TO NUMBER TEN PEOPLE A DAY DIALED OUR TRANSLATION SYSTEM ROUGHLY TWO TO THREE OF THOSE. ARE ALL. THAT ARE WHAT WE CALL THE MOST USER SO- SOMEONE WALKING TO ONE BIKING OR- AND TRY OF SOMEONE TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO TRANSIT OUR COLLEAGUES WHO JUST- LEFT THE LEFT THE PANEL HERE- NOTICE VERY WELL. SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE. STAFF THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY- IT WILL BE. GOING IN THE FIELD DOING INVESTIGATIONS UP WILL BE USING INFORMATION FROM OUR PARTNERSHIPS- WHO IN THE ROOM TO THE C. ANOTHER LOCAL LAW ENFORCE THE LAW SUBMIT TO. OUR PERHAPS ISSUE. AND BUT YOU KNOW IN SOME QUE BE A REAL ISSUE A THAT'S A DONE A FIVE. WHERE SOMEONE WAS YOU KNOW SOMEONE DRINKING DRIP AND DRIVING OR SUPPORT WAS DISTRACTED AND IN SOME CASES IT MAY BE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE- WHERE. ARE YOU KNOW THAT POOR LIGHTING OR THERE WAS A BAD CROSSWALK OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE- BUT WE'LL HAVE MORE STAFF THAT WILL BE TO DEDICATE. TO ADDRESS THEM ONE. THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO. THE NEXT ISSUE. THERE ARE RARE A WILDFIRE SIXTY I'M LOOKING. YES THIS IS- ISSUE NUMBER TWO AS WELL FAR LITIGATION I THINK YOU'VE ASKED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL- POSITIONS IT IT TO THEM YES WHAT WE DID SHERMAN- THAT PERMIT STATION REQUEST AN INCREASE OF POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR FORTY FOUR FOR YOUR LONG TERM. RESOURCES FOR INCREASE IS IN THE LEGAL VISIONS WORKLOAD SO FROM WHILE- VIOLETS SHOULD THE WORKLOAD FIRST REGARDING MY FOR A LIL LITIGATION SEEDS THE LEGAL TENS OF THIS THING THANK CANNOT. CURRENT LAW AND FUND. THERE ARE MOST WILDFIRE LITIGATIONS THAT MAKE COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER DURING THE NEXT YEAR WITH THE NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS RANGING FROM SIX HUNDRED TO ROUGHLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED I SHOULD SAY TIMELY AND DEFENSE OF WATER LETTING THEM REQUIRE DEDICATED RESEARCH SAYS SPOKE PERFECT TO THE IMMEDIATE. METS AB SO WHY- DO THIS IN HOUSE AS OPPOSED TO HIRING- A QUALIFIED LAW FIRM- THAT ALREADY HAS AND- EXPERTISE IN THE AND THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION. SO IT WHAT WE'RE FACING THIS ISSUE- PRETTY PRETTY HAD ON AS THE AS WE'VE SEEN THE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE PICKED UP- ACROSS THE STATE RECENTLY. PERSONALLY I WAS THE DAY I WAS SWORN IN IN TODAY'S JOB THE CAN KATE FIRES STARTED ACROSS THE STATE- AND OUR DEPARTMENT OUR STAFF HAD TO YOU KNOW HOW TO IMMEDIATELY REACT THIS- BUT THE ON. ALL HANDS ON. BACK BEAMED OUT RESPOND TO. BE FOCUSED EVERYONE IS ROOM KNOWS WHAT THAN I DO WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OF THE FIRES THAT WE ARE- WE'RE HAVING TO GO THROUGH LITIGATION ON RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT THE EASIEST WAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS WE BELIEVE WE'VE GOT THE EXPERTISE BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH THE STRUGGLING. WE'VE GOT THE EXPERTISE IN HOUSE. TO DEAL WITH THAT- THEIR COST- CHALLENGES AS RELATES TO. I SOMETHING LIKE THIS- WE LOOK AT UPWARDS OF PROBABLY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR. BOB AND COST. IF WE WERE TO GO TO. A PRIVATE ENTITY TO HELP US WITH THIS LITIGATION SO WE THINK IT'LL BE MORE EFFICIENT IF WE DID THIS WORK IN HOUSE- AND- AND THE COST AS WELL- WILL BE. WE BELIEVE A LOT HIGHER- IF WE WERE TO OUTSOURCE. TO A PRIVATE FIRM TO HANDLE FOR US ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- THIS LA- HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO. THANK YOU MINUTES THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- HELLO GERMAN WOMAN MEMBERS- BELIAU RECOMMENDS THAT THE- COMMITTEE APPROVE AUGMENTATION FOR COUCH AND JUST LEGAL DIVISION. AND I ASSESSMENT WE FIND IT LIKELY THAT WORK LOAD WILL INCREASE STEMMING FROM THE WILD BY LITIGATION. AND THAT IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF THE STATE TAP CALTRANS SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED TO THE BAND IN ANY LAWSUIT REGARD BEEN- IN REGARDS TO WHAT FOR LITIGATION. OVER AND LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE FURTHER WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE LEVEL SERVICE SCORES RELATED THE TREE AND BRUSH ENCROACHMENT. LEVEL SERVICE SCORES IN THIS AREA OF HAVE BEEN AROUND SEVENTY AND RECENT YEARS. AND A RECENT REPORT- FROM TRAINS GET TO THE APPOINTMENT THE GOAL OF NINETY WE HAVE IT. HELLO HELLO SERVICE SCORE ARE WHAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE WILD FIRES. BUT THEY ARE CONCERNING GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF WILD FIRES THAT OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS- AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY BE INTERESTED IN ASKING THE DEPARTMENT- AND IF YOU LOOK IN YOUR AGENDA. YOU HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT IT. THEN WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU. DEPARTMENT AND GUARDS HOW IT CONDUCTS- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. CAN CAN YOU. DEFINED WHAT THE LEVEL OF SERVICE SCORER MEANS- YES OF COURSE- LEVEL SERVICE SCORES ARE- CONDUCTED BY CALTRANS PERIODICALLY- THEY RANGE FROM ZERO TO A HUNDRED BUT ZERO BEING LOW AND A HUNDRED BEING HIGH- THEY'RE DONE ON A DISTRICT WILL BASIS THAN A SAMPLING OF THE STATE I IT'S THEM AN AGGREGATED FROM DISTRICT WELL STATE LEVEL. TREE IMPRESSION QUOTE FROM MARTIN STANDING IN BOTH CALTRANS IS DOING IN TERMS OF CONDUCTING ITS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WITH TRIM BRUSH ENCROACHING ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM WHAT GOES INTO DETERMINING- A SCORE. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IN DETERMINING A SCORE IT'S BASED ON HOW WELL THIS SAMPLING OF THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM- REFLECTS OUR ACCOUNT AND IS- ABIDING BY ITS- MET ITS MAINTENANCE POLICIES- BUT I WOULD BELIEVE THAT THAT BE A BETTER QUESTION DIRECT DEPARTMENT TO HOW EXACT. TO CALCULATE. THE PART AND NOT RESPOND TO UP A LITTLE BIT DOWN THE WE I KNOW THAT I WAS GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN SO IT IT IF- YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION TODAY IT'S SOMETHING THAT- WE ADDRESS STAFF LEVEL TWO YEAH AND THEN WE CAN GET BACK CHAIRMAN WE CAN WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WHAT WHAT DETAIL ON ON HOW THIS IS. HOW THE SPORT SEVEN HUNDRED HOW TO ELLIS OF SIG JUST BRIEFLY THAT WE GO THE WAY YOU APPROACH THIS IS THAT WE HAVE A REAL BASED OUT APPROACH SO THE AREAS THAT WE THINK ARE- THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO CAUSE ISSUES FOR US. IN THE STATE SO ON THOSE THOSE AREAS MORE SO THAT HAVE. THE HOUSE WILL HAVE. IF YOU WILL OUR AREAS WE DON'T SEE AS A POTENTIAL HAVE AN EIGHT A HIGHLIGHT REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE FOCUS HEAVILY ON THOSE AREAS AREAS WE THANK WILL CAUSE THE MICHIGAN ISSUES FOR US OF AS RELATES TO FIRES WE FOR ONE OF THE AREAS. THAT MAY IMPACT. SOME OF THE SCORING OF THAT THAT. WE SEE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL SCORE FOR- FOR THE ENTIRE STATE SYSTEM SOME AREAS MAY- MAY SCORE- IN IN THE IN THE PORT. POOR CONDITION BUT WITH THIS ON A HIGH HIGH- HIGH RISK HERE. IS WHAT DO. AND THEY ADD THE DIRECTORS IS COMMENTS LEVEL STE THE SERVICE SCORES ARE ALSO BASED ON. THE AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE- CAN BE PROVIDED FOR THAT FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE PRIVATIZATIONS THE EFFORT NO I DIRECTED TOWARDS MENTIONING YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE THE WILDFIRES DOES TAKE HIGHER PRIORITY CLEARING OUT THE BURNED AREAS BECAUSE THAT'S AT RISK FOR THE MOTORING PUBLIC. BUT A HIGH PRICE ALREADY YOUR- WHICH WHICH- TO OTHERS. I THAT MAYBE MORE BECAUSE- IT IS NOT A SLEEP A AT TWO THE MOTOR AND- SO I RESULT CAUGHT. BILLS OF SERVICE SCORES YOU KNOW NECESSARILY. PIECE BASS WE WOULD LIKE SO BECAUSE OF THAT IT TAKES OF ANOTHER CYCLE TO GET TO THE QUESTION BECAUSE THE PART. SO IN. IF I WERE IN AN NOT ANOTHER WAVE IT WILL BE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM LEVELS OF SAFETY AND FOR EXAMPLE HIGH FIRE. ZONE AREA. OF RESOURCES MIGHT BE DIRECTED THERE AS OPPOSED TO CLEANING UP TRASH ON THE SIDE OF ROAD IN AN URBAN AREA- SO THERE WOULD BE LESS OF THAT I GUESS THE- DOWNSIDE IS THAT. ROUGHLY IN AND GET OUT BY WAY OF EXAMPLE AND- I THINK THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT- IS THAT IT- LENDS TO THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WORK IS NOT BEING DONE- AT AT AT THE LEVEL THAT THE- EXPECTS AND- FALSE. FALSE ASSUMPTION SYSTEM WIDE BUT WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT. ARE ON ON THE ROADWAY. IT LEADS TO IT BUT A NAGGING PERCEPTIONS. DEFINITELY SOMETHING IF THAT WOULD BE. A STEP PIECE OF WOOD. ONE TO WORK ON APARTMENT HAVE A AND- THAT. NO IT IS PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF- ALL THREE OF THESE ITEMS YES. OKAY ALL RIGHT YES WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE FOR A SECOND AND- DO ADD ONS BOTTLE.

THE TRANSFER WILL PROVIDE AN INCREASED ANNUAL LOCAL SYSTEMS FUNDING CAPACITY OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO FUND THE AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM A MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM. THE HOUSE THE CAP OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOR- INDIVIDUAL GRANT DETERMINED. SO THAT CAP IS DETERMINED IS BY USING OUR HISTORICAL DATA OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS YOU KNOW WEEKS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT WERE SEEN THAT OVER 90% OF THOSE APPLICANTS APPLYING FOR THOSE GRANT. BEYOND A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TO FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE AT THAT AMOUNT WOULD SATISFY WHAT WE NEED. OKAY ELIA COMMENTS. I HAVEN'T SO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS REGARDING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- REQUIRING THE CDFA TO COLLECT THE FUEL TAX DATA AND- THIS WILL HELP THE STATE- GATHER INFORMATION TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUTURE- AS FOR THE REQUEST TO TRANSFER FUNDS FROM THE LOCAL AIRPORT SLOW THE CAP ON TO THE- AERONAUTICS ACCOUNT. FOUND PROPOSAL TO BE IS THE ON THIRSTY. THE LADY AT THE AMOUNT. AND MANY CAN ADMINISTRATIVELY TRANSFER FROM THE LOAN ACCOUNT TO THE AERONAUTICS ACCOUNT IF THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IS INSUFFICIENT- AND COVER THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO- ON THERE IS TO MONITOR THE ISSUE AND REYES VISIT WHETHER OR NOT THAT HUNDRED FIFTY THAT CAP IS TEN. TO FISH AND TO ME IS A THEIR PART MOVING FORWARD. RIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S JAMES MORE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WOULD LIKE TO JUST REITERATE THE ALEJO'S COMMENT THAT IF THIS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE MATCHING FUNDS UP TO THAT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP- WE HAVE EXISTING STATUTORY FOR.

THE FEDERAL REAL ID ACT REQUIRES THEM TO PRESENT A REAL LADY TO GET A REALITY IN PERSON AND SHOW UP OUT WITH A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF DOC. I CITY MUCH UP BUT- MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA A- STATE WE'RE NOT MANDATING CALIFORNIA'S TO GET A REAL ID BASED ON OUR SURVEY OF OTHER VOLUNTARY STATES AT DMV ASSUME TO PARTICIPATION RATE OF SIXTEEN MILLION POTENTIAL REAL ID CUSTOMERS. WINTERS THE LOWER ANTICIPATION RATE AT THE ONSET. THAT INCREASE WOULD- THAT WOULD INCREASE AS WE GOT CLOSER TO THE OCTOBER FIRST ENFORCEMENT DATE. PROBABLY EVEN MORE CHALLENGING NOW WITHOUT THE CORONA VIRUS AS AS THE CHAIRMANSHIP. SO FAR PROXY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE A REAL ID THE TOTAL PARTICIPATION RATE HAS BEEN LOWER THAN EXPECTED- WE HAVE SEEN PARTICIPATION RATE INCREASE- WITH EACH MONTH BUT GIVEN THE CURRENT YEAR TREND IT'S UNLIKELY THAT SIXTEEN MILLION.

MAKE WHERE JUST CONVERTED TO ADD TO ACTION AND THAT BOTH IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND AS WELL AS OTHER LANGUAGES. INCLUDING AT. THE COP SHOWS IN SPANISH BUILDING IN THE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU CAN FIT. INTO DISCUSS EVERITT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. SO I OF A TICKET THAT. YOU ARE MAKING SOME PROGRESS IN BRINGING DOWN THE- THE WAIT TIMES FOR. A VERY SERVICES AT THE- ALL. BUT MY UNDER. IS THE NOW. THAT THE COURT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING TWO AND A HALF HOURS OR MORE- HAS BEEN INCREASING. AT YOU COULD. OF US THAT ISSUE AND WHAT DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT IS INTENDED TO DO ABOUT IT TO BE GREAT YEAH THE FIRST I WANNA MINIMIZE AT THE PEOPLE DESERVE TO THE RIGHT ON THE ON THE CHART THAT SPURS PUT ON THE ENERGY LBC REPORT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE CROSS THAT DISTRIBUTION. I THINK TWO THINGS TO MESSAGES RIGHT THE OVERALL WAIT TIMES ARE DOWN DRAMATICALLY FROM WHERE THEY WERE- DURING THIS UNDER THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. NOW THEY'RE DOWN LAST MONTH THEY WERE DOWN SIX MINUTES FOR APPOINTMENTS AND AROUND THIRTY MINUTES FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT UPON ITSELF REALLY NEAR ALL TIME RECORD LOWS FOR THOSE NOW OUR INTENTION IS NOT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ABSOLUTE WILL RECORD- WAIT TIMES OUR INTENTION IS TO NOW GET MORE. GREAT THAT CAPACITY WHICH IS ACTUALLY DRIVEN DOWN THAT WAY TIME AND ACTUALLY FILL THAT CAPACITY WITH WITH PEOPLE THAT NEED RELATED TRANSACTIONS IN THE OFFICE. OUT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT ON THE RIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION CURVE THAT THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT MISTER CHAIR. IS WE ARE WORKING ON ON DIFFERENT SCHEDULING- ALGORITHMS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT. DOES MATCH CUSTOMER DEMAND TO MAKE IT WE CAN ACT EIGHT PEOPLE OUT AND EIGHT. HUNDRED FOR SOMEONE COMES INTO OUR OFFICE BE. FIVE EIGHT. WE ACTUALLY. THE BULLS ARE. UNTIL AT LAST PERSONS OFFICIALLY SERVED ON WE CLOSE OUR DOORS. SERVE LAST PERSON SOMETIMES I CAN REALLY ALONG AT THE TIMES. BUT WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO THAT AND THERE'S AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING- A LESSON 1% PROBLEM BUT IT'S IMPORTANT ONE PRESENTED. THE OPTICS ON A ARE BAD BUT ALSO WE WANT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE WAITING. AN HOUR TO I APPRECIATE YOUR- SAYING THAT IS AN IMPORT. IMPORTANT ISSUE. IF YOU'RE THE PERSON WHO IS IN. AND TILE AND WAITING TWO AND A HALF HOURS IT'S A BIG DEAL TO YOU AND. AND TO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT- THAT YOU'RE- TRYING TO ADDRESS IT- I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT CUSTOMERS AND CERTAIN FIELD OFFICES AT THE YOU KNOW. GEOGRAPHICALLY ARE EXPERIENCING- WAIT TIMES HOW. HOW DOES THAT COME TO PASS WELL I THINK EACH OFFICE IS AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN STAFFING THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN MANAGEMENT- AS- PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE ARE ARE AWARE THAT SOME OPERATE ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS. AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE GIVEN US FUNDING TO GO OFF AND BUILD A LAYER OF MANAGEMENT THAT ARE CALLED AREA MANAGERS IN THIS AREA MANAGED TO HAVE A MUCH GREATER TOUCH ON THOSE LITTLE OFFICES. THERE INITIATIVE IT WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK CLOSE. AND SHOULD BRING THEM IN LINE WITH THE SCHEDULING MECHANISMS WE WANT THEM TO HAVE MAKE SURE THEIR RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE DAY ME. TO GET. THE TOOLS THE FACT SOURCE IN AND SUPPLY IMAGINE IT IS A VERY OLD PROBLEM AND WE'RE TRYING TO USE NOW HOW THAT SOLUTIONS BEEN SOLVED OTHER INDUSTRIES APPLYING THAT SAME TECHNOLOGY WERE JUST ROLLING THAT OUT AS WE SPEAK TO CONTINUE TO MAKE IT SORT MORE SCIENTIFIC TO SAY OKAY HOW MANY PEOPLE I KNEW THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MEET OUR CURRENT AND PATTERN OR CONVERSELY AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE. YES WE MORE TECHNOLOGY MAKING THINGS MORE MOBILE AS WELL AS OPEN UP OTHER CHANNELS YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE DO TAKE SOME OF THOSE HIGH DEMAND ITEMS OF THE OUT OF THIS INPUT MY BUT THE BOTTOM PROVIDE IS ONE OF A PARTNER SUCH AS SUCH AS THE JUST. NOTHING HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE BEFORE WE ACTUALLY. ARE A- TO DISCERN RIZ. YEAH I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TALK. A LOT OF URBAN CORE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE CONGESTION IS IT'S NOT A PROBABLY BY VERY READY SUMMERS AS LACKEY BEFORE SUMMER SO MUCH. THE TARGET IS KIND OF EARLY JUNE. SO BEFORE SUMMER OFFICIALLY START. SEARCHING FOR US OF- FINALLY- I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S A HIGH TURNOVER RATE AND- SOME OF FIELD OFFICES SO WITH THE- VACANCY RATE TO. BUY AND HOW ARE YOU GOING ABOUT FILLING THOSE VACANCIES- THE VACANCY RATE AGAIN VERY IS BY OFFICE BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK TO THE- INCOME THE AGAIN CRIMINAL FUNDING THAT THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION THE ASSEMBLY GAVE US WERE SORT AROUND 90% OF THOSE PEOPLE BEING HIRED. OFFERS BEING GENERATED THAT THEY'RE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF GOING TO TRAIN AND SO ON. BUT WE DO HAVE SOME AREAS AGAIN IN IN MORE COMPETITIVE DISTRICTS THAT OUT OR TURNOVER RATE. AND WE- DO YOU SEE THE STEPS THAT IT TAKES IN THE IN THE HIRING PROCESS ABOUT NINETY DAYS TO GO FROM YOU OPEN IN A POSITION TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THE FIRST OFFER BEING GENERATED WE REDUCE THAT THE THIRTY DAYS WE SPED UP OR REDUCE THE CYCLE TIME OF THAT PROCESS SO WE CAN HIRE AN ON BOARD MORE QUICKLY AND IS NOT A NUMBER OF OTHER SIMPLIFICATION THINGS WERE DOING BUT IT'S GONNA BE A COMBINATION OF SPEEDING UP THOSE PROCESSES AND BEING ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LEAVE I MEAN WE ARE NOT. FINANCIALLY COMPETITIVE- IN SOME AND SOME MARKETS AND AT THE CAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAMS DISTRICT AND YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE IN SAN FRANCISCO OF BEING THE IN THE EMPLOYEE AND BEING COMPENSATED AT A COMPETITIVE MAY WITH WITH UP THERE HELLO OF TURN PART MAY IF YOU'RE IN PERSON OTHER PLACE. THAT THAT'S EACH OF. WE HAVE MAKE SURE. THAT OUR- FOR. SOME OF THE THOSE A JUST GONNA HELP THE PEOPLE TO BE HE THE BE ENTERED IN THE VALUE OF SIR AND YOU SEE THAT WERE WILL AND ABLE TO CHANGE I THINK THAT'S A LAW OF THINGS THAT ARE MANAGEMENT HE HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN TO DO AN WERE ACTIVE WORKING ON THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TANGO AND I FOR TAKING AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE ISSUE UGH UGH MAKING SURE OUR SITE IS LOOKING TO. SARD RESULT OF LOWERING THOSE WAIT TIMES SO. AND I SUSPECT GERMAN TING AT SOME QUESTIONS. AS CHAIR YES. REALLY APPRECIATE- YOUR EFFORTS- JUST JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS- I THINK IT'S GREAT THE- ADVERTISING HAS DEFINITELY GONE UP I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE VISIBLE. I SEE IT QUITE OFTEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IS WHERE I. PRIMARILY INTERFACE WITH IT- I'VE I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'VE DONE ENGLISH AS WELL AS SPANISH I JUST WANT TO. UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR PLANS WERE FOR OTHER LANGUAGES ESPECIALLY THE DIFFERENT ASIAN LANGUAGES. YEAH THERE'S MATERIALS AVAILABLE TODAY AND ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS THAT ARE TIED TO BOTH CANTONESE WELL AS MATTER DESERVE TO ASIAN LANGUAGES. ANDERSON LANGUAGE WELL IT. AND I'M NOT THAT YOU'RE DOING A RADIO OR TV FOR WHATEVER REASON WE ARE CALLING A TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE USING LIKE DIFFERENTLY BUT BACK BACK TO YOUR BROADER BROADER PERSPECTIVE AND WE ARE CERTAINLY ADVERTISED IN OTHER LANGUAGES AS WELL TO REACHING OUT TO THE MONKEY HE TO THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY JUST TO NAME A FEW SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT WE HAVE A DISTRIBUTION ACROSS MANY MANY LIKE WE TRY TO REACH THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE. AND TRYING TO YOU KNOW IN COMMUNITY TAKE HIS ACTION WITH EVERYONE ELSE. OKAY BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT THE BEST. MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WHAT. ADVERTISING DO YOU PLAN TO DO IN ASIAN LANGUAGES AND IN WHAT MEDIUMS. WELL I DON'T HAVE THAT DETAIL WITH ME BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO. GET YOU THAT INFORMATION OFF LINE I KNOW I HAVE IT BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE IT HERE. I THINK IT'S- VERY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT'S- PART OF OUR STAY. AND IT TOOK ME THAT CAN BE EASILY REACHED IF YOU COMMUNICATE TO THEM AND- THEY ARE WE TO WHERE THEY ARE AND THEY'RE WHERE THEY GET MOST INFORMATION IS THROUGH ETHNIC MEDIA. SO I MEAN IT'S AN AND THEN THE NICE THING IS IT'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN. TRADITIONAL MAINSTREAM MEDIA SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING READY AT. A LOT MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IF YOU ACTUALLY- ARE TARGETING IN.

OKAY US NOW SO THE TOTAL USAGE IS RELATIVELY FLAT ACROSS MORE DEVICES SO THE MORE CONVENIENT BUT WOULD EXPECT HIM TO UP IN IN USE IT AT THE SAME TIME GIVEN WE ARE PRESENTLY. WITH THE KIA PAYING YOUR MONEY. YOUR IS ACTION OR TO SAVE WHERE GOT YOUR SUPERMARKET SO ENDED WE COMMUNICATED THIS TO OUR OUR GAS SUPPLIER THAT. MOST PEOPLE WOULD PREFER TO DO THE TRANSACTION ON A MOBILE DEVICE ON THE COMPUTER AT HOME SOMEWHERE IN TRANSIT WHERE THEY MIGHT BE- AS OPPOSED TO GOING TO KIA SO THIS IS JUST GO TO COMPETING STRATEGY FOR THE SAME EYEBALLS AND SELL. CATION OVER A LONGER I WASN'T EXPECTED TO HAPPEN THIS. IS TO ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT HAPPEN THE KIA CAPITAL TO GET BECAUSE WE'VE- GIVEN THEM A MORE CONVENIENT SOLUTION. GOT AND THAT THAT WAS THAT'S MY QUESTION SO PERFECT. SO YOU SEE MAYBE YOUR RAMP DOWN FROM THE KIOSK MAY BE THE KEY ALSO JUST ONLY BE IN THE MOST. REMOTE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE YOU YOU KNOW WOULD YOU WOULD YOU JUST DON'T HAVE. WE HAVE OFFICES WHICH JUST AREN'T VERY TO EACH OTHER. AND ARE WE REALLY GONNA WRAP UP THE ONLINE PRESENCE STILL YES AT THE- WOULD BE. THAT YES FOR US ARE WE PAY ONLY ON A PERCH. BASIS OF THE STATE IS REALLY NO RISK IN HAVING INFINITE CHAOS OUT THERE THE VENDOR AS BUT- IS A BILL TO IN. THE KEEP CAN DO EIGHT. YOUR STE. REAL TIME INC. AS IT SEEMS LIKE LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE YOU'LL KIOSK TO SERVE A VITAL ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY. SO SOME OF THE MOST- CROWDED OFFICERS ONE OF THE- BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE HEARD WERE FRANKLY JUST EVEN A LACK OF SPACE EVEN AS YOU HAD. PEOPLE COME IN- IT WASN'T YOU KNOW WE COULD HIRE TWENTY MORE STOUT THAT THEIR WORK. WINDOWS COMPUTER SIXERS HOW ARE YOU. GRAPPLING WITH THAT POTENTIAL ISSUE YES SIR OTHERS COMPLETED ONE IS STILL WORSE WE ARE WE ARE AGAIN AGGRESSIVELY MOVING NON URGENT DMV FOCUS TRANSACTIONS OUT OF THEOFFICE WE JUST RE LAUNCHED OUR AUTHENTICATION APPROACH I'M SURE YOU'VE USED OUR OUR WEBSITE IN BEFORE TO AUTHENTICATE YOU NEEDED TO A LOT OF INFORMATION. AND IT WAS THE STATE WAS NOT MODERN BUT WE JUST RELAX ABOUT WEEKS AGO RETURNING TO RELAUNCH A SERIES OF APPLICATIONS SO WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SOME CLIENTS ARE THE UP THERE ARE SEATED KLEIN. TRANSACTION OFFICE BUT IT'S STILL TOO SOON TO TELL AS WERE RE LAUNCHING THOSE APPLICATIONS. IN THE OPPOSITE SELF I ARE KEEP TRAGEDY THERE IS WE'RE REASON TEXT MESSAGING SO WHERE TO MAKE SURE THE SITE ARE. VERY CAN CONSIST SO WHEN YOU COME INTO THE WE SHOULD SAY OKAY WE YOU'RE WHERE YOU ARE IN LINE WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA ASK YOU FOR YOUR MOBILE NUMBER RENTABLE GETTING READY ACTUALLY WHEN YOU'RE A THIN LINE. WE HAVE THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF THAT'S SHE COMING IN ABOUT THIRD. MINUTES FORTY IS WHAT WILL BE WILL BE FROM OUR AMERICAN THAT THAT'LL BE SHOULD YOU DO WITH YELP IT'LL SHOW WE YOU ARE IN LINE SEALED HOW MUCH TIME YOU. TO DO OF ERRANDS WHATEVER YOU MIGHT DO SO THAT WE WON'T BE CROWDING THE LOBBY SO I THINK THOSE COUPLE OF DROUGHT IS HARD B. THE- YOU CAN. WERE IN. GRADE AT ALL WE- WALL AROUND I MEAN THIS ISN'T. WE HAVE TO YOU THE SPACE. AS FISHING THE WE CAN AND ANOTHER ANOTHER STRETCH OF A TO A- ADD TO THAT. HILL AS YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF OUR- THAT WE STARTED WITH MAKE. DOING A WHAT'S CALLED A- TO MAPPING. EVER STEP OF THE- YOU KNOW THE STOCK WATCH YOU CAN PICTURE THE- YEAH THEY MEASURE THAT PROCESS THAT FOR REAL IDEA TWENTY. WE ARE NOW TEN MINUTES SCRIPT SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING. IT HERE THERE BROWN BECAUSE- YOU REDUCE EIGHTEEN IT'S BECAUSE- WHAT WE- SAW THE PROCESS. WERE ON IT I MEAN WE ACTUALLY DID. PROCESS AND HOW WE DID BUSINESS PROCESS RE. HARBOR HARBOR USE THAT IN YOUR VOCABULARY. BUT WE AGGRESSIVE BEAT UP A TARGET WILL WHY TO TAKING TWENTY MINUTES I HAVE SAT THROUGH A NUMBER THE HAS ACTED IN A FEW. OF THEM WE CAN. THAT FIRST. ARE IN. YOUR THE PAPERS. THERE'S NO VALUE IN THAT TRADE. WHAT'S SEE LOOK AT THE STEP FIND OUT WHY WE'RE DOING THE AND THEN WE WILL. ACROSS YA AND SOME DOES THE SAME THING WE JUST. IT SO IT WOULD WE JUST PULL THAT PER. THE PART. WENT DOWN TO ITS ESSENCE AS YOU WOULD DO IF I. THAT WE SAID WHAT ARE THE- AT A TO ASK WHAT ARE THE NON. ADDED WE'VE A WAY TO ELIMINATE ALL THE NON VALUE ADDED TASK AND THAT GETS YOU TO TEN MINUTES. YEAH I THINK IT BE WOULD IT BE HELPFUL. FOR YOU TO JUST. COMMUNICATE WITH ALL I MEAN ALL OF US WE SEND OUT. EMAILS EVERY WEEK OR TWO WEEKS ON A FRIDAY OF ISSUES I KNOW THAT. I'M NOT. AN INMATE WAS. FROM BEING. SO IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE WE'RE TELLING OF TO GO IN. FOR REAL ID. BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO TELL US. THEY SHOULD GO IN FOR. GRACE PART OF THAT CAN BE. ISSUE BE HEY. IF YOU WANTED.

TELL THEM WHAT TO NOT GOING FOR THEY JUST MAY JUST OUT OF HABIT JUST. WE WILL ACTUALLY TAKE INTERNET TO GIVE YOU THAT IF YOU WILL THE PRESS KIT ABOUT WHAT WHAT TO SAY WHEN JUST WHEN IT'S THE LAW GOOD LUCK HELP PAN. AND GRAY I THINK A LOT THE LAST FOUR. WAS REALLY GOT ROUTE. TIMES I KNOW THAT. YOU TEND TO YOU. THIS OF AVERAGE WAIT TIMES WHICH I DON'T. ALWAYS FIND EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE MEDIAN WAIT TIME THIS YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THAT HANDY BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK I UNDERSTAND TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THAT MID POINT IS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR JUST THE OVERALL AVERAGE AVERAGE JUST CAN'T BE- THIS WILL BE DECEIVING BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANNA. IT I AM NOT. MEETING WITH. YOU BETTER KNOW. JUST BECAUSE- WE KNOW THAT SOME. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT. OFFICES THERE ARE IN MORE REMOTE LOCATIONS. MIGHT MY GUESS IS THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH. WAIT TIMES AND WE'RE NOT GONNA. WE'RE NOT GONNA GET RID OF THESE OFFICES. BECAUSE THEY- THEY SERVE. YOU KNOW PARTS OF THE STATE THAT NEED THAT SERVICE. BUT MY SENSE IS THEY'RE NOT. GETTING NEARLY THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC AND- THEN DIDN'T SAY IN MY- IN MY- PARTICULAR CITY OR MY PARTICULAR DISTRICTS I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S JUST HELPFUL TO. BUT AND IF DIFFERENTIATE. GREAT OKAY BUT DID NOT APPRECIATE THE THANK YOU CHAIR DID I HEAR YOU SAY EARLIER THAT WITH RESPECT TO REAL IDEA THAT YOU ACTUALLY ONLINE CAN DO THIS IN YOUR BUNNY SLIPPERS- YES SIR. WE'LL GET IS NOT RECALL THAT A REFERENCE TO MR TANG MYSELF. I HAVE NO KNOWLEDG OF FOOTWEAR BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THE H. AS AS A REQUIREMENT OF FOOTWEAR SO. TING AND THEN THEM IS RIVAS AS QUEST I JUST WANNA QUESTIONS TO THE TO THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR IS FOR- A TWO HUNDRED MILLION- AT NINETEEN ALMOST TWO THOUSAND POSITIONS IS THAT IN ADDITION. TO THE TWO FORTY TWO TWO THOUSAND POSITIONS THAT WE- DID LAST YEAR I'M GONNA TO MISTER LEE SCOTT FIFTH. SUPPORT FOR CURRENT HEARD FOR NINETEEN TWENTY TO GET THE ADDITIONAL. NINETEEN HARPER. AND THEN IN- FOR. BUT IT WAS FOR ROUGHLY ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OUT OF THE TWO AND THREE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR TOLD BUDGET I BECAUSE IT WAS REAL IDEA TO BUY STUFF FOR OPERATIONAL PREVENTS THAT AND NOT NUMBER DOES SLIGHTLY DIPPED IN BUDGET- TO ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR NINE GOT IT AND THEN AND WHAT. OF THOSE HOW MANY THERE'S A TEMPORARY POSITIONS VERSUS FULL TIME GET GO KNOWING THAT THIS REAL ID IS SORT OF YOU KNOW FIGURE THIS YEAR BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HOPE THAT WOULD TELL OFF IN THE COMING YEARS RIGHT AT THE MOTHER RIGHT NOW IT IS ONLY FOR TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM WE JUST HAVE I CAN'T TYPE IS THE SENSE OF AND THAT WILL BE FREE OF OPERATING. A GO FOR BUT THE IS THAT RELATIONSHIP KIND OF OFF UP AND THAT'S TO YOUR LIVE FOR THAT TO THE POSITIONS OR JUST A PORTION OF THAT I'M I'M SORRY IT'S JUST IT TO THE RIGHT YET MATT SEATED APARTMENT FINANCE- THE PROPOSAL WAS FOR- ROUGHLY.

AND THE PLAN IS ALSO EVEN TO LOOK AT SOME OF OUR OFFICES TODAY THAT ARE OPEN ON SATURDAYS AND MAYBE EVEN TEST THEM TO FIND OUT IF THEY COULD BE DEDICATED TO REALIZE THE WHICH IS GOING TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY FOR THOSE PERIODS. AND THE REASON WE THINK IT'S OKAY TO DO THAT IS THAT AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE WELL BODIES ARE NOT REQUIRED BUT USING WEB SERVICES USING MOBILE USING VARIOUS OTHER APPLICATIONS WE CREATED A MECHANISM ALONG WITH KIOSKS TO DO ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE AND BY BY SUMMER WE EXPECT TO BE AT A POINT WHERE. YOU DON'T. BELIEVE YES 7580% OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED I MEAN FOR THE SAFER VEHICLE REGISTRATION SERVICE CAN BE DONE BY ALTERNATE MEANS STRONGLY URGE PEOPLE TO USE US SO WE ARE GONNA TEST A NUMBER OF THINGS AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT.

WELL GOOD MORNING GERMAN WOMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COMMISSIONER WAR STANLEY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY COME BEFORE YOU TO TALK ABOUT OUR- OUR BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THIS IMPORTANT GETTING US PREPARE FOR TODAY AS YOU STATED WE HAVE A FEW ITEMS THAT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THE TO NOW START OUT FIRST AS YOU REQUESTED. AND WITH THE E. CIGARETTE TAX ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO HERE WITH ME. HIS ASSISTANT CHIEF SHONDA RAY FROM OUR LEGISLATIVE OFFICE. SO WE HAVE A B. C. P. BEFORE YOU THAT REQUEST TEN POSITIONS AND A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PERMANENT AUGMENTATION. FROM THE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE PRODUCTS TAX FUNDED FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO STAND OF A TASK FORCE CHARTER COMBATING ILLICIT PEIPING DEVICE AND PRODUCT IMPORT EXPORT MANUFACTURING TRANSPORTATION DISTRIBUTION AND SALES. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE USE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS VAPING HAS INCREASED GREATLY. THIS NEW POPULARITY HAS LED TO A MARKET OF ILLICIT VAPING DEVICES AND OTHER COMMODITIES. NOW THESE UNREGULATED AND BLACK MARKET PRODUCTS CAN CONTAIN DANGEROUS ADDITIVES FOUND IN BOTH PEIPING FLEW- LIQUIDS AND IN CONSTRUCTION OF THE DEVICES. AS OF DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THE CDC PLACES NUMBER OF EACH CIGARETTE VAPING PRODUCT- LONG INJURIES AT TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE. AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS ON A NATIONAL BASIS AT FORTY EIGHT. NOW TO ADDRESS IS RAPIDLY INCREAING- YOUTH- MOVEMENT THAT USE THESE NICOTINE BASE RAPING PRODUCTS. THE PROPOSED BUDGET SEEKS A NEW NICOTINE CONTENT BASED E. CIGARETTE TAX. NEW TAX WILL BEGIN IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WENT TO DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THE FORTY MILLIGRAMS OF NICOTINE IN THEIR PRODUCTS. THE TAXI WILL BE USED FOR ADMINISTRATION OF COURSE MEANT YOU PREVENTION AND HEALTH CARE WORK AT WORK FORCE PROGRAMS. NOW PROPOSAL LEVERAGES THE OVER SEVENTY UNIFORM OFFICERS THIRTY FOUR STATIONERY COMMERCIAL VEHICLE INSPECTION FACILITIES. AND NEARLY FOUR MILLION CONTACTS THAT WE MAKE EACH YEAR AND ALSO A SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATION TEAM- DELETE THIS TASK FORCE IN COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO WE CAN PROVIDE FOCUS ENFORCEMENT WITH THE INTENT TO INVESTIGATE AND TO DISRUPT THIS FLOW. POSTED VAPING DEVICES AND PRODUCTS BEING DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS AN INITIAL FOUNDATION FOR THE PROGRAM WERE ASKING FOR ONE SERGEANT TO SUPERVISE A STATE WIDE PROGRAM. AND NINE OFFICERS BEFORE SPECIALIZED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT TARGETING THESE ILLEGAL VAPING DEVICES AND IN THE IMPORT AND EXPORT MANUFACTURING TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SALES WE PROPOSE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION OF THE SEVEN MILLION TO BE ALLOCATED- FOR CONTRACTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE T. WITH THESE EFFORTS WE HAVE RECEIVED THE LETTER COMMITMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- ENDORSING THIS AFTER. THE SEAT THE OJ WE HAVE A HISTORY OF WORKING TOGETHER WITH SPECIALIZED TASK FORCES ON VARIOUS ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. THIS PROPOSAL KIND THAT COMBINES THE UNIQUE STRENGTHS OF BOTH DEPARTMENTS AND LEVERAGES OUR EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE CAN BE WHICH CAN BE LABELED AS AN ACADEMIC. AND WHAT I'LL DO NOW IS ALL THAT THE SYSTEM CHEAP TO RATE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT DOJ DOES AND THEN I'LL- GO WITH SOME OTHER COMMENTS ON. A GOOD MORNING. I THINK TO THE QUESTION- Y. C. H. P. AND WHAT ARE THE OTHER AGENCIES DO AND AS COMMITTEE STAFF POINTS OUT ME NOW SAYS THERE ARE SOME EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS WHETHER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THESE EFFORTS ARE MORE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT ARE UNDER AGE TO USE. OF OTHERWISE LEGAL PRODUCTS AND WHAT WERE INTENDED TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ARE. IS ILLICIT PRODUCTS SO ELITE PRODUCTS AND WHEN IT COMES TO VAPING. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT A LOT OF NOT AND THERE ISN'T A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WE ADMIT THAT IN THIS. PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY REALLY FOR DONNA WE'RE NOT AWARE IN OUR RESEARCH IN OUR EFFORTS WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANYBODY THAT'S TRULY FOCUSED ON. THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE BLACK MARKET AND THE ILLICIT PRODUCTS AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE. WE WOULD HAVE SOME EXPERTISE WHETHER IT'S AN ILLICIT DRUGS OR OTHERWISE- CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THAT'S WE DO HAVE SOME EXPERTISE THAT WE GET MIND TOWARDS. DISRUPTING THIS UNDERSTANDING WHAT. IS ACTUALLY OUT THERE. AND MAYBE GET A BETTER HANDLE ON WHERE THE STATE GOES. IN THE FUTURE WITH THESE EFFORTS. SO I. TAKE YOUR POINT THAT THE A CH P. HAS SOME EXPERTISE IN IN THESE AREAS BUT- SO DOES LOCAL LAW. FIRST MAPS JUST UNDERSTAND AND DEPART VOEPEL HEALTH I THINK IS. GONNA GET ôNG EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO- TOBACCO ISSUES. THIS SEEMS TO BE A SHIFT AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHERE THE- THE EQUITIES LANARKSHIRE WHAT I THINK PART OF IT IS IT'S A STATEWIDE EFFORT IN IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT RECENTLY HAPPEN- WITH THE RECENT LEGISLATION THERE AUTHORIZES EACH P. WITH THE- REGIONAL ORGANIZE. RETAIL TASK FORCES WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS THERE. AND WE FEEL THAT DOING SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO THAT WORKING WITH DOJ- WE COULD HAVE IMPACT ON THIS ISSUE ALSO. ON THE STATE WIDE ON THE STATE WIDE BASIS. OKAY WITH OUR EXPERTISE- IN IN CONDUCTING THESE TYPES INVESTIGATION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- LA- AND- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE. OKAY I'M YES SO WE FIND THE PROPOSAL THAT- HIS TAKING ACTION ON ILLICIT VAPING PRODUCTS TO BE A REASONABLE ONE GIVEN THE SERIOUS HEALTH CONCERNS THAT- THAT ELICIT THE PRODUCTS MAY POSE OUT TO THE PUBLIC- BUT WE AGREE WITH THAT THIS. S. STAFF THE COMMITTEE STAFF THAT. AND THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL THREE MAIN CONCERNS WE HAVE FIRST IS THAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IS UNCLEAR SO- AS THE DEPARTMENT HAS MENTIONED WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT- ABOUT THE BLACK MARKET IS IT REALLY A AT LEAST A CANNABIS ISSUE- OR IS IT REALLY- THE VAPING ISSUE REALLY I'M- SHOULD BE TARGETED TOWARDS UNDER AGE YOU SAYS. VAPE SO USED TO USE OF FAITH YOUTH ADDICTION TO NICOTINE. AND DEPENDING ON KIND OF HOW WE DEFINE THE PROBLEM THAT WOULD INFORM- THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. AND DEPENDING ON THE KIND OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM IN MALES AND FOR- INFORMED. AT THE TYPE OF STRATEGY THAT THE STATE PURSUES I'M- TO AT TO JUSTICE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN SO ENFORCEMENT ONE STRATEGY- BUT AS YOU'VE MENTIONED PUBLIC HEALTH HAS ALSO BEEN ENGAGING IN A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN SO- SHOULD YOUTH EDUCATION OUR PUBLIC AWARENESS ALSO BE A PART OF THE STRATEGY THAT THE STATE PURSUES- TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE PHYLLIS OF A BAND THAT. THE DAY SHIFT THAT BEING RELATED LONG ON THE SET. AND THEN KIND OF THAT THE LAST CONCERN WE HAVE IS THAT- AS YOU MENTIONED. IT'S NOT. PARTY THAT. NICE THEIR EXPERT THEN I'M CRIMINAL VEST BUT ARE YOU KNOW OTHER DEPARTMENTS- TV PH FOR EXAMPLE AT THAT HAS DONE- SOME TOBACCO- AT WORK AS WELL AS- TO BUREAU OF CANADA CONTROL WHO'S DONE CANNABIS. FORCE AND SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT WOULD MAYBE WE THERE ARE OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE I'M YOU KNOW THEIR PRIOR EXPERIENCE. AS WELL AS LOCAL FORCED ME TO SEE THAT MAY ALSO HAVE- PRIOR EXPERTISE IN. DOING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS AREA. RIGHT THANK YOU FINANCE. TEAM IN A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST ADD THAT- WE WOULD UNDERSTAND AND CERTAINLY I GOT THE IDEA THAT WAS THERE ISN'T A LOT KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE PRODUCTS UNDER THE STATE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WERE ON. LEADING ON CH YOU TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT AND WE INCOME I WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME LEARNINGS FROM THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE GOING UNDERTAKEN THAT. ERRORS THAT WERE MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES AND JUST TO BE SURE TO THE WOULD BE AT THAT TIME. THANK LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE.
