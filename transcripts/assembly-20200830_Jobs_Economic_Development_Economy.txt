I'M BOB LANTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION CBA AT THE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION THAT IS THE COORDINATING AND ADVISORY BODY EPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S FORTY FIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS. THAT'S RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN. LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS WORK CLOSELY AND HAVE DEEP CONNECTIONS WITH BOTH THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL AND CONTRACT EDUCATION CENTERS LOCAL BORDER SUPPORTIVE OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO SHORT TERM TRAINING AND ARE THEMSELVES A BUSINESS LED SYSTEM THAT STRIVES TO BE RESPONSIVE TO BUSINESS. HE TO BE A SUPPORTER SUPPORTIVE OF GREATER ACCESS TO TRAINING AND GREATER SYSTEM COURT NATION ESPECIALLY AS OUR STATE ECONOMY RECOVERS. UNFORTUNATELY AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN IT'S NOT A BILL THAT WORKS TOWARDS EITHER OF THOSE OBJECTIVES THE BILL'S LANGUAGE TO ENHANCE REGIONALLY FOCUSED STATEWIDE BUSINESS TRAINING CENTER NETWORKS DID NOT PROVIDE ANY SPECIFICITY AS TO HOW TO MAKE TRAINING MORE READILY AVAILABLE. AND IT'S MANDATE OF REGIONAL SKILLS MAPPING GREAT AND OTHER SILENT PLANNING PROCESS BUT DOES NOT COORDINATE WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WILL LEAD TO CONFUSION BETWEEN. BUSINESSES AND JOBSEEKERS. AB FORTY FIFTY SO. THE DECIMATED THE COPS STABILIZE MILLION. IN A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED FINANCIAL STRAIN. RATHER THAN PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS TRAINING THE BILL LAST OR COORDINATION FROM THE LABOR AGENCY. ETP THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD AND GO THERE. AND EXPENSIVE AND POTENTIALLY PROLONG PLANNING PROCESS. IN ADDITION THE BILL'S REQUEST TO CREATE REGIONAL SKILLED MAPS RECREATES THE WORK WITH THE STATE'S WORKFORCE BOARD HAS DONE TO REGIONAL PLANNING AND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGIONAL CPP CONSORTIA HAVE ALREAD UNDER GOD. WHICH THE STATE. HAS ALREADY INVESTED MILLIONS AND- WE RECKON THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE TICKET. IN RETRAINING. AND SUPPORTING BUSINESSES AND CALIFORNIANS AFFECTED BACKUP IN NINETEEN. HOWEVER EIGHTY FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN THE BILL THAT IS SET UP TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON COORDINATING EFFORTS AND GETTING MONEY OUT THE DOOR FOR SUPPORT SERVICES AND TRAINING. THIS TIME OF CRISIS IT'S AN EXPENSIVE MISTAKE TO MAKE. THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERING OUR CONCERNS. THE YOU SIR AND UNDERSTAND WE ALSO OF ANNA ELDORADO WITH THE EDGE COALITION ON THE LINE. MS ALTERADO PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M NOT ABOUT ABOUT WHAT THE CALIFORNIA AT COALITION ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ADD TO THE STATEWIDE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE ECHO THE SAME CONCERNS THAT THE W. A. WITH REGARDS TO ADDING NEW REQUIREMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL IN ADDITION TO CONCERNS AROUND THE NEED FOR MORE SHORT TERM. CREDENTIALS COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALREADY OFFER SHORT TERM TRAINING PROGRAMS BOTH ARE REGULAR CREDIT AND ON A CONTRACT EDUCATION BASIS WE KNOW THERE IS URGENCY AROUND ENSURING PEOPLE CAN GET BACK TO WORK WE ALSO KNOW THAT LONGER TERM CREDENTIALS HAVE BETTER LABOR MARKET PAY OFF. WHAT IMMEDIATELY AND OVER TIME INDIVIDUALS WHO OBTAIN A LONGER TERM CREDENTIALED GENERALLY ARE ABLE TO RETAIN JOBS AND EARNING FAMILY SUSTAINING INCOME. THEREFORE WE BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE CONSIDERATION OF THE MIX UP CREDENTIALS NEEDED DURING THESE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE I LOOK FORWARD TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR.

RADIUS OR- CERVANTES OF ONE OF YOU WOULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. SO IT JUST STARTED TO. IN RESPONSE TO THE OPPOSITION AND THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ON WHETHER THIS PILOT PROJECT DUPLICATES ANY EXISTING TRAINING PROGRAMS BY IN THIS REGARD I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT LANGUAGE RECENTLY AMENDED INTO AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH STATES. THAT THE PILOT IS TO AVOID DUPLICATION AND TO SUPPLEMENT AND EXPAND ONLY WHERE NEEDED TO ME EMPLOYER TRAINING NEEDS. ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED WAS THAT THE REGIONAL SKILL GAP MAPPING IS DUPLICATE DUPLICATIVE OF OTHER MAPPING EFFORTS. IN THIS REGARD I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE FOLLOWING FIRST THOSE PLANNING EFFORTS ARE NOT SCHEDULED TO BEGIN UNTIL NEXT SPRING SECOND THE RECENT AMENDMENTS REQUIRED THAT DATA USED TO IDENTIFY THE REGIONAL SKILL GAPS BE SHARED WITH LOCAL REGIONAL WORKFORCE BOARDS. HAVING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CENTERS FOR EXCELLENCE UNDERTAKE THIS EXAMINATION OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN ACADEMY SOONER RATHER THAN LATER CAN SERVE AS A JUMPSTART. TO FUTURE PLANNING EFFORTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE AND TRAINING PARTNERS AGAIN AND THOSE WERE A COUPLE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I WANTED JUST TO. TOUCH ON TODAY. I'M OF THE BILL.
