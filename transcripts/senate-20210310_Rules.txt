THANK YOU CENTER BATES- YEAH ONE ISSUE THAT WE DID DISCOVERED DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS THAT I'D IDENTIFICATION AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY FOR ALCOHOL SERVICE- WAS NOT BEING PROPERLY CHECKED. IN SO- WE DID OUR FIRST OPERATION BACK IN- APRIL AND- IT WAS VERY ALARMING WE HAD A 79% VIOLATION RATE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SO THAT BECAME A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT- WE CONTINUED AND AFTER US SEVEN MORE OPERATIONS- THE LAST OPERATION BEING IN JANUARY WE'RE ABLE TO REDUCE THE VIOLATION RATE TO A 17% VIOLATION RATE. SO WE'D WE TOOK THE MATTER VERY SERIOUSLY- WE ARE REALLY SPENT TIME EDUCATING. AND DOING OUTREACH WITH THESE OTHER THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES AND WE CONTINUE AND GET TO ENGAGE WITH THESE COMPANIES- WE DISCUSS BEST PRACTICES A DAY MADE CHANGES ON THEIR ORDERING PLATFORMS TO ENSURE THAT IDENTIFICATION IS PROPERLY CHECKED.

AND ALSO EARNED A MASTER'S IN SOCIAL IMPACT FROM CLAREMONT LINCOLN UNIVERSITY- COMPASSION ABOUT THIS ROLE BECAUSE I WANTED STUDENTS OR HOW WILL I DON'T WANT STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE. SOME OF THE- WHAT I CALL THE DEFICITS OF THE SYSTEM BUT I DO WANT TO ASSIST IN SCALING UP. THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT HELP ME GET THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND TO THE PLACE THAT I FIND MYSELF TODAY. AND I WOULD USE MY MIND MY EXPERTISE AS A FORMER STUDENT. I SERVED AS A STUDENT TRUSTEE- EXAM AGAIN COLLEGE AND ALSO ARE CURRENTLY SEATED TRUSTEE OF A MULTI COLLEGE DISTRICT AND WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN INITIALLY IS COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY.

WHERE THREE THOUSAND LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO COLLEGE AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THAT PROGRAM.

ON WHAT I DEEM TO BE A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT JOB AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN NOW- COMMITTEE COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA AND- THEY MENTIONED NOT ONLY DO WE ARE THESE PLACES WERE- INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT THE AVERAGE AGE OF BELIEVES TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS BECOME A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF THE- CONSIDERED LEARNING. APPROACH INCREASINGLY COMPLEX SOCIETY IN WHICH WE- HAVEN'T SO MANY NEW JOBS AND SKILLS. ARE BEING ENGAGED I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU- IN OUR MEETING AND I DO SO NOW OF PUBLICLY. TO BE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE IN AN AREA OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT I THINK IS SO ESSENTIAL FOR.

THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM- MISTER WILLIAMS I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRUST YOU BUT- I AGAIN ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS ABOUT THANKING YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND- I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS YOU KNOW WHAT LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED- BY COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT HAVE TRANSITIONED TO REMOTE INSTRUCTION. AND WHAT'S YOUR- WHAT DO YOU ENVISION REGARDING DISTANCE LEARNING GOING FORWARD. YEAH I THINK THE LESSONS LEARNED IS THAT YOU KNOWWE COULD DO A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WE CAN DO BEFORE BECAUSE- WE- AND LOCALLY WE TRANSITION. 80% OF OUR CLASSES ONLINE IN A MATTER OF TWO WEEKS AND WE GET A LOT OF WE GET CRITICIZED A LOT ABOUT. HOW SLOW WE MOVEMENT SO I THINK ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARNINGS THAT WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO INNOVATE WHEN- THE WILL IS THERE TO DO SO AND I THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED- YOU KNOW IT IS YOU KNOW JUST HOW ARE WE USING TECHNOLOGY TO. ENGAGE D. THE VARIOUS LEARNING STYLES OF OUR STUDENTS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M HOPING THAT THE FUTURE WILL LOOK LIKE IS A MORE HYBRID OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WHERE THEY GET A MIX. OF IN PERSON AND ONLINE ENGAGEMENT. ON YOU KNOW I'M ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY OF WHAT DIGITAL TEXTBOOKS CAN BRING IN TERMS OF. HOW DYNAMIC THEY CAN BE AND HOW YOU CAN UPDATE THEM AND CHANGE THEM ON THE FLY INTO TESTING GOOGLE'S BOOKS. AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT YOU KNOW THROUGH USING TECHNOLOGY LIKE THAT IT ACTUALLY INCREASES THE RETENTION OF INFORMATION ON STUDENTS SO- YOU KNOW THOSE ARE JUST JUST A FEW THINGS THAT- I THINK THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR. ONLINE LEARNING. THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING THAT. SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. A AND- MONEY JUST- TERRY I REALLY ENJOYED OUR MEETING THIS MORNING I REALLY ENJOYED TALKING ABOUT OUR COMMON SERVICE AS COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEES AND ALSO HAD REALLY ENJOYED TALKING ABOUT OUR COMMON SERVICE WITH JOHN LONG FAIL AND I THINK SENATOR BATES ALSO SERVED. A HE'S ON THE COLLEGE BOARD WITH- YOU DID IT WELL- SO THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS TO TAKE BACK I THINK THE INTERESTING THING FOR MORE CONVERSATION AND THERE WERE MANY. IS THAT YOUR IN THIS UNIQUE POSITION THAT YOU SERVE SEVEN YEARS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND NOW YOU GET TO TAKE ALL THE LESSONS OR PASSIONS TO THE STATE LEVEL WHILE DOING BOTH SERVICE- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT YOU HAVE FROM- YOUR LOCAL SERVICE ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR DO YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE AND PRESS. AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. YEAH YOU KNOW. I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT I WHAT I LIKE TO WHICH WE TEND TO HAVE A DEFICIT MINDSET AND YOU KNOW FOCUS ON THE NEED FIRST AND- WHAT I'VE LEARNED IS THAT YOU KNOW THROUGH ASSET COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT KIND OF APPROACH IF WE LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING. WELL AND WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE THERE THERE'S ALWAYS THESE POCKETS OF EXCELLENCE THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN IDENTIFY. AND YOU KNOW DO MY EXPERIENCE LOCALLY AND IN THE WORK FORCE FOR WE LOOK AT IS HOW DO WE TAKE THE ASSETS AND WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES AND START LOOKING AT REGIONALLY. HOW WE CAN REPLICATE THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING WELL AND THEN SCALE. AND ALSO IDENTIFY IF THERE ARE SOME GAPS BEGIN TO CREATE PLANS TO ADDRESS THOSE GAPS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE LOCALLY THAT I THAT I HOPE TO BRING TO THE STATE IS. BEING ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH COUNTIES AND YOU KNOW CALFRESH IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE WHERE YOU KNOW WE BEGIN TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW THE OUNTY BOARD OF SOUPS. TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO OPEN UP CAO FRESH TO SOME OF OUR STUDENTS AND I THINK AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT GREAT WAYS TO LEVERAGE THE RESOURCES THAT WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO. THE STATE AGENCIES AND IN THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO WORK CLOSER AND ARE MORE STRATEGICALLY WHAT THE CAMPUSES. AND YOU KNOW BEGIN TO GET THE CAMPUSES TO SEE THEMSELVES AS A PART OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM. AND IT IT JUST REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND NOT JUST BE KINDA ISLANDS TO THEMSELVES AND IN AND ASK. YOU KNOW REALLY WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM YOU KNOW BEING ON THE SAN BERNARDINO COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD IS THAT IF WE REACH OUT. BREAK BREAD WITH SOME OF THE OTHER ENTITIES WE GOT FIVE BECAUSE WE'RE SOMETIMES WE'RE ALL SERVING THE SAME PEOPLE BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TOGETHER AND SO. HOPEFULLY BEING ABLE TO PLACE THAT ON THE MIND OF THE BARGAIN IN JUST DOING SOME OUTREACH TO STATE DEPARTMENTS AND JUST TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER. IS SOMETHING THAT I REALLY LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BRING TO THE TABLE GRATEFUL THANK THE BOARD OF THE LUCKY TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LEAHY SENATOR BATES. WELL LET ME ASK OF THAT A VERY IMPRESSED- SPECIALLY WITH YOUR GOAL. FOR YOUR TENURE ON THIS BOARD ON MR WILLIAMS I WAS READING THAT AND I WAS REALLY TAKEN BY. ONE OF THE GOALS THAT YOU SET FORTH COURSE RELEVANCE TO SKILLS STUDENTS WILL NEED TO SUCCEED IN THE WORKPLACE. AND NOTING THAT THE RECENT SURVEYS OF CORPORATE LEADERS THAT SHE WOULD BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH ALSO BASED ON YOUR CLIMATE HISTORY BELIEVE HERE COLLEGE GRAD SCHOOL HAVE SKILLS LIKE. PROBLEM SOLVING AND CRITICAL THINKING NEEDED TO JOBS AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT- WE HOLD A VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT IS THE IT IS THE STATE OF OPPORTUNITY. AND CERTAINLY ARE- ON OUR- ELEMENTARY ARE SECONDARY AND COLLEGE EDUCATION IS VITAL TO- BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT DREAM SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW COURSES CAN BE STRUCTURED TO KIND OF ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. IT IS ONE OF YOUR GOALS AND I'M SURE THAT YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF THINKING ABOUT. WHAT SHE WOULD BRING FORWARD IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS THAT YOU SERVE ON THIS BOARD. VERY VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS FUNDAMENTAL I THINK WE GO TO COLLEGE- TO LEARN THE PROBLEM SOLVING THAT CERTAINLY WHAT FACES ALL OF US AT EVERY LEVEL OF OUR SOCIETY NOW. THOSE SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT WITH ME AND OF I'M VERY IMPRESSED. YEAH THERE'S A FRAMEWORK THAT I'VE BEEN STUDYING CALL TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LEARNING SKILLS AND- YOU KNOW IT IS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT AND- I THINK THE FIRST THE FIRST PART IS BUILDING. TRUSTEE CAPACITY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE AND THEIR AUTHORITY BECAUSE WE TEND TO STAY OUT OF CURRICULA. AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S A TEN PLUS ONE ISSUE AND BUT STATE LAW DOES GIVE. THE TRUSTEES THE ABILITY TO BRING ABOUT- SPECIFIC PROGRAMMING AND YOU KNOW THEY'VE IT JUST SAYS NO WE HAVE TO- COLLEGIATELY CONSULT WITH OUR ACADEMIC SENATES AND YOU KNOW. BRING THEM IN INTO THE CONVERSATION AND MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE THEY'RE OF ALL THIS SO I THINK THAT FIRST PART IS MAKING SURE THE TRUSTEES DO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO HAVE A ROLE. IN MAKING SURE BECAUSE THEY ARE ELECTED TO KNOW WHAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS AND SELL WHAT I HEAR FROM EMPLOYERS ALL THE TIME IS THAT. YOU KNOW YOU GUYS ARE NOT GETTING ANY YOU DON'T DEVELOP CURRICULUM FAST ENOUGH. AND YOU'RE NOT FOCUSED ON THE SKILLS THAT- WE MEET YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE MY DISTRICT IS BUILDING. A NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR- CAREER TECH CENTER IN IS A NET ZERO BUILDING. YES WE DON'T HAVE ENERGY RELATED CURRICULUM- PLANET SO I'VE BEEN PRESSING TO SAY THAT LOOK. WE'RE GONNA SPEND ALL THESE EXTRA MONEY BUILDING THESE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IT'S GOT A SHOP IN THE CURRICULUM THE CPUC. IS TALKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW WE GET THESE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- THEY'RE GRAPPLING WITH THIS WHOLE IDEA OF ADAPTIVE CAPACITY AND HOW. COMMUNITIES ARE ARE ABLE TO ADAPT AND EVOLVE WITH THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS ONE WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT MAKE SURE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE ADVANCED BUILDINGS WE'RE TEACHING THE STUDENTS ABOUT. HOW THEY WERE IN ALL THE DIFFERENT CAREER PATHS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND SO. I THINK YOU KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL WAS PUSHING A DIALOGUE. I WAS REALLY. IN DOWN AND TALKING. THE LARGEST. SIZE AND YEARS AND REALLY. GET A BASELINE OF WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ALL OF LOOKING FOR. A CALIBRATED IS YOU KNOW WHAT COMPANY BASED. ON AGE. MODEL WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM BACK THAT COULD BE APPLIED IN THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS TO REALLY. YOU KNOW FOCUS ON CORE SKILLS LIKE COMMUNICATION SKILLS FINANCIAL ALL OF THE BASIC SKILLS THAT YOU DON'T REALLY LEARN. IN K. TWELVE AND YOU KNOW EVEN IN OUR SYSTEM I THINK SO PRICE IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. I'LL MAKE SURE THAT WE YOU KNOW BUILD OUR CAPACITY TO JUST REALLY UNDERSTAND THE- THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE WITH SOME OF THESE THESE THESE ISSUES IS WHAT I REALLY. YOU KNOW AIM TO DO IS TALK ABOUT IT A LOT AND GRAIN YOU KNOW THESE FOLKS TO THE TABLE. AND KIND. OF LEARN AND DEVELOP THE SOLUTIONS TOGETHER. OKAY YOU FOR THE RESPONSE AND PROBABLY IMPORTANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE LEVELS BEYOND JUST.

DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE FUNDING MODEL- WILL BE IMPACTED. I REGRET ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION I WISH WE HAD THAT CRYSTAL BALL BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE PALLISTER'S TEAM HAS BEEN TERRIFIC THEY DO- THEY SURVEYED THAT RETIREES ON MONTHLY BASIS WE BEGAN TO SEE SOME UPTICK IN RETIREMENTS IN THE BEGINNING OF OUR FISCAL YEAR- AND JUST STARTING IN THE JULY TIME FRAME WE DID AT QUESTIONS. AND CAN CONFIRM THAT A NUMBER OF THE UPTICK IN RETIREMENT ASSISTED A PANDEMIC RELATED REASONS AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN IN COORDINATION WITH OUR ACTUARY TEAM AND OTHERS AND AT THIS POINT WE DON'T SEE A TRAP AND THAT'S MATERIAL- THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY UNDER RIGHT BUT IT IS UNDER CONSTANT EVALUATION. AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT. THE YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU- AND SENATOR I LOOK TO YOU BECAUSE I KNEW THOSE WOULD BE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS YOU WOULD ASK RELATED TO FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY- AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT. I EXPECTED NO LESS- CENTER LAYERED YES BUT THE SINCE I KNOW THIS IS A NON PREFER I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE TRANSCRIPT OF ONE PART OF YOUR COMMENT. TO ABLE TO CIRCULATE WHY DO IT- THE- OF AND I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET. A AND- I ACTUALLY. SINCE I HAVE A MOTHER ON A VERY MODEST PENSION FROM YOUR SYSTEM I DO HEAR ABOUT THE OPERATIONS REGULARLY. AND I HAD JUST ONE QUESTION IN A WAY IT'S A FOLLOW UP ON SENATOR GROVES AND THAT IS YOU ARE INVOLVED IN FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING DYNAMICS WITH CAL STIRS IS SET AND WITH PURSES WHILE. IS THERE SUCH A FLUCTUATION IN THE ECONOMY AND SUCH A FLUCTUATION IN THE INVESTMENTS. THAT ARM THEIR CALLS. TO ACT WHEN EUROPE ONE END OR ANOTHER THERE'S A CALL TO ACT WHEN THE ECONOMY IS REALLY DOWN THAT SOMEHOW WE READ TO DO SOMETHING DRAMATIC AND THERE'S A CALL TO DO OTHER THINGS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS WAY UP. HOW DO YOU MANAGE. THE SORT OF POLICY IN THE FACE OF THE FLUCTUATIONS TO BE CONSISTENT AND BE TRUE TO WHAT THE LONG TERM OF VISION OR LONG TERM FACTS MIGHT BE. THANK YOU SENATOR- WHAT THE IT STARTS WITH THE POLICY AS YOU NOTED AND HAVING A POLICY THAT'S DESIGNED TO MEET THE EXPECTED RETURN OVER THE LONG TERM AND HOLLISTER SAYS A LONG TERM INVESTOR. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE SHORT TERM SO THAT NEEDS TO BRING INTO A FACT INVESTMENT VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS. SO THESE ARE THE FACTORS THAT WE BALANCE- THAT THAT IN SETTING THE POLICIES AND THAT THE STAFF. MANAGES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND CONTINUES TO REPORT THAT BACK TO US SO. THE DANGER IS AND TRYING TO REALLY FOLLOW SHORT TERM SWINGS AND THIS LATEST- EXPERIENCE WITH THE- MOST IN A SWIFT DOWNDRAFT OF THE INVESTMENT MARKETS IN THE ECONOMY THAT WE'VE SEEN AND THEN MOST RAPID INCREASE. IN THE MARKETS WHERE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE VERY REAL ISSUES THAT WE ALL FACE EVERY DAY- IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT SO IT'S VERY COMPLEX- AS FOR SAM AND OUR CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER LIKES TO SAY WE'RE WE'RE CRUISE SHIP. AND A CRUISE SHIP FOR GOOD REASON TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE LONG RUN WE KEEP AN EYE AND QUIDDITY. AND WE KEEP AN EYE ON SOUND. PRACTICES AND POLICIES TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES I AM NOT A- ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE THE CURSE ME I DON'T KNOW. IT USED TO BE THAT THERE WAS- AN INCREASE THAT HAD TO BE. CONNECTED FOR THE PENSIONERS EVERY YEAR A. N. THERE WAS TALK OF MAKING IT A STANDARD 2% INCREASE OR WHATEVER DO YOU KNOW WHAT. THE STATUS OF THAT IS AT THIS POINT. SLASH THERE ARE- YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON IF I THINK I KNOW I WANT TO BE SURE I GET THE CORRECT. THERE WELL I HAD THIS EXPERIENCE THAT MAYBE OTHER MEMBERS OF HAD. THAT MY MOTHER GOT A LEGISLATIVE ALERT ABOUT THE 2% AND MAILED TO ME WRITING ACROSS THE TOP IS THIS TRUE. I THOUGHT MAYBE I DO A LITTLE PREVENTIVE ACTION RIGHT HERE. I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESPONSE THANK YOU. YEAH AND SO WONDERFUL KNOWING THAT WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON BEHALF OF YOUR MOTHER'S PART OF. THANK YOU. SHE'LL BE BESIDE HERSELF TO HEAR THAT YOU CAME UP AT A HEARING IN. BOB YOU KNOW I. WON NEVER ASK. A LADY HER AGE BUT YOUR MOM IS.

COURTESY OF- BACKGROUND AND OF A MY COLLEAGUES OF BASICALLY AFTER QUESTIONS THE TSUNAMI THAT MIGHT BE FACING US WITH THE NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS FROM CROSS CAL STIRS IS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT OUT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU I'M SURE. ALSO OF SOUNDS LIKE YOU YOU'RE ANTICIPATING THAT I DID SERVE ON THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND AS SUCH WE HAD A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND WHEN WE HIT THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. TWO THOUSAND NINE AND FEDERAL WE HAD A REAL YOU KNOW BOTH IN TERMS OF WHETHER WE WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW MEET UP. THE PENSION OBLIGATIONS THAT YEAR SO THOSE ARE ALWAYS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU ARE ANTICIPATING THAT AND ARE THE PLAN AND THAT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY THERE FOR ABOUT FOR ABOUT THREE LEE GREAT TO HEAR- I DO HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT WHO'S KIND OF WRITING CAL STIRS WHO'S THE CEO AND I.
