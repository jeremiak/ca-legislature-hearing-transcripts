00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:48.660
STATE LOCAL RELATIONSHIP AND

00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:50.495
DELIVERING SERVICES. WE ALSO

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.464
NOTE THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.498
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- ASSISTED

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.433
WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT THERE

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.402
IS SIGNIFICANT A DELEGATION OF

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.337
DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY TO DS

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.405
ASKED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:02.373
PROPOSAL ABOUT HOW THE REGIONAL

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.309
ADMINISTRATORS WOULD BE CHOSEN

00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:05.643
AND WHAT SERVICES WOULD BE

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.313
PROVIDED LOCALLY. SO ODD BEGIN

00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:09.347
ON PAGE ELEVEN WE RAISE A

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:09.914
NUMBER OF KEY QUESTIONS THE

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:11.449
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER THAT

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:12.684
EVALUATES THE MERITS OF THAT

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.353
APPROACH PROPOSAL. A PEACH

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.354
TWELVE ADJUSTER TO CLOSE MY

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:17.622
COMMENTS ON THIS- IN THIS AREA

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:19.357
NOTING THAT STRUCK EARLY

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.426
OBLIGATION NO WOULD COMMIT THE

00:29:21.493 --> 00:29:22.594
LEGISLATURE- TOO FUNNY IN A

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.396
PARTICULAR STRATEGY. EARLY ON

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:29.567
IN IN. THE DELIBERATION OF THE

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:30.702
BUDGET. RELATED TO THE MEDIC

00:29:30.768 --> 00:29:31.803
HELP. WILL JUST NOTE THAT THIS

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.339
IN THIS I'M SPEAKING PAGE. NOW

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:36.441
THIS IS A NOVEL APPROACH FOR

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:38.409
USE THE MEDICAL FUNDING TO

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:40.345
DELIVER TO THE NON MEDI CAL

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:42.413
HOUSING RELATED SERVICES. I

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.550
ALSO NOTE THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:46.584
ALSO PROPOSING A NUMBER OF

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:48.319
CHANGES RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:52.423
HEALTH. AND SO- FOR ALL WHAT

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.625
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT TO THE GIVEN

00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:55.326
THE SCALE OF THE HOMELESSNESS

00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:56.594
CHALLENGES THE GOVERNOR'S

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.329
EFFORTS TO MAKE CONTINUED

00:29:58.396 --> 00:29:59.430
INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA SEEMS

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:01.499
WARRANTED AN INDIVIDUAL

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:02.634
COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.535
PROPOSAL TO MERIT

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:06.337
CONSIDERATION. HOWEVER OUR

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:07.472
COMMENTS REALLY FOCUSES OF THE

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:09.340
LACK OF A COHESIVE APPROACH

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:11.342
TAKEN OF ALL OF THE COMPONENTS

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:13.444
TOGETHER AND CONCERNS THAT

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.345
THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL

00:30:14.412 --> 00:30:17.482
FRAGMENTATION AS A RESULT. AND

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:19.450
SO WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS A

00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:21.352
NEED FOR A CLEAR STRATEGY

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.487
MOVING FORWARD AS I FOR THE

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:24.422
LATE OUT IN RECENT YEARS. THE

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.424
LEGISLATURE THE MACHINE OF

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.327
TAKEN A YEAR BY YEAR APPROACH

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:29.961
AND SO NOW IN ITS THIRD YEAR IT

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:30.461
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A

00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:31.396
DEMONSTRATED INTEREST IN

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:33.431
CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT. SO WE

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.599
THINK THAT SORT OF A LOOK BACK

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.334
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:37.435
STRATEGY THAT'S GONNA

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:39.404
COMPREHENSIVE MOVING FORWARD IS

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.339
NEEDED. AND SO WE DO RECOMMEND

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:42.540
WITHHOLDING EARLY ACTION TO

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:44.409
ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TIME SIR

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:46.611
TO THINK THROUGH THE KEY

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:50.481
DECISIONS AND ON PAGE SIXTEEN

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:51.449
OF YOUR HAND OUT WITH HER. OUT

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:57.388
TO THE AN ISSUE. RIGHT WITHIN.

00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:58.356
THROUGH THE LARGEST LONG PLAN

00:30:58.423 --> 00:30:59.557
AND I DID A CALL AND MAKE A

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:00.592
SURE THAT SOLUTIONS ARE. WITH

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:03.394
THE AND- FUNDING SOURCE. ARE ON

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:04.596
THE PAGE OF THE- WHICH IS NOT

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:05.830
THAT WE UNDER. THAT THERE IS A

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.332
DESIRE. TO MAKE MOVE QUICKLY

00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:08.466
AND BRING RELIEF TO THE

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.335
INDIVIDUALS- EXPERIENCING

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.337
HOMELESSNESS STATEWIDE AND

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:13.438
DEVELOPING A PLAN WILL TAKE

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:15.340
TIME. AND SO IF THERE IS A LEAD

00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:16.474
INTERESTED IN MOVING FORWARD

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:18.409
WHILE THE PLAN TAKES SHAPE WE

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:21.346
DO THINK THAT THERE COULD BE- A

00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:23.348
ONE TIME A PROPOSAL ALLOCATED

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:24.716
THIS YEAR YOU. SEEN THE SEVEN

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:25.917
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POSTS

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:27.352
THE GOVERNOR OR SOME DIFFERENT

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:29.387
MOUNT. USING MECHANISMS THAT

00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:33.324
ALREADY EXISTS TODAY. OF YOUR

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:34.292
GOING. TO NEW MECHANISM AND

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:35.526
YOU'RE SHOULD READY TO CONTINUE

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:40.431
DOWN THAT PATH LONG TERM. YOU

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:42.367
TO TAKE IN YOUR QUESTION THANK.

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:44.569
I AM I MAY START AND THEN

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:45.637
LOOKED OTHER COMMITTEE WHO WON

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:48.473
TO IN. I'M ALSO WITH YOUR CAR

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.341
IF I MAY. LOCALS ARE MORE

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:53.344
ATTUNED THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES.

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:54.512
WE'VE INVESTED THREE BILLION

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:57.348
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:58.416
HOW OLD WE'VE BEEN DOING. SO

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:00.418
THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY IN

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:02.353
THE EARLY SAYS EARLY STAGES AND

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.588
SO. WE HAVEN'T REALLY QUITE

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.390
SEEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:07.325
REALLY ASSESS HOW IT'S WORKING-

00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:09.327
THEY KEEP FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE-

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:10.695
THAT FUNDING WAS JUST MADE

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:13.431
AVAILABLE THROUGH- IT. JANUARY

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:15.300
OF TWENTY NINETEEN. I KNOW

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:15.900
THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:18.303
THE POINT IN TIME COUNTS AND

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:19.504
SEEN THE 16% INCREASE BETWEEN

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.406
EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN. ARE THE

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.707
KEEP MONEY REALLY WASN'T

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:24.342
AVAILABLE IN TIME TO REALLY

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:26.411
MAKE REFLECTS THAT THAT JUMP IN

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:27.679
HOMELESSNESS UP POPULATION TO

00:32:27.745 --> 00:32:30.348
THE STATE WIDE. AND WE DO KNOW

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:32.383
THAT THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORTS

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.485
ARE DUE FROM CITIES AND SEE IF

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:35.353
HE'S RELATED TO THEIR HEAT

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.487
FUNDING THAT WAS JUST DUE IN

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:37.422
JANUARY AND WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:32:37.488 --> 00:32:38.623
ADMINISTRATION IS REVIEWING TO

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.461
SEE. HOW THAT'S GOING. ONE OF

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:44.896
THE CENTRAL THEME ALSO SEEMS OF

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:46.597
ACCOUNTABLE. AND I THINK IT'S

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:49.434
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THAT

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.469
DISCUSSION AT THIS TIME. IN HIS

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.671
STATE OF THE STATE THE GOVERNOR

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:56.407
LISTED FOR. PRIORITY AREAS FOR

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:59.510
US TO FOLLOW- I TOOK A PICTURE

00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:02.347
OF IT SO I COULD TELL YOU WHAT

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:06.351
THEY WERE. NUMBER OF NEW LEASES

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:08.319
SIGNED NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:09.354
UNITS CONVERTED OR BUILT.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.422
NUMBER OF PEOPLE STABILIZE WITH

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:14.492
RENT SUBSIDIES AND NUMBER OF

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:15.360
PEOPLE MOVED OFF THE STREETS.

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:19.330
WOULD YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:22.500
THOSE FOR- AREAS METRICS FOR US

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:24.602
TO EVALUATE DO YOU THINK THERE

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.504
ARE ANY OTHERS THAT WOULD BE

00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:29.340
IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADD. AND

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:31.409
HOW REALISTIC IS IT FOR

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:33.411
COUNTIES ARE REGION'S TO REPORT

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:35.413
THIS TYPE OF DATA IN A

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.416
MEANINGFUL WAY. SO FOR AT ANY

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:40.385
PROGRAM WHERE STATE RESOURCES

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:42.320
ARE BEING GIVEN TO LOCALS

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:44.355
HAVING ROBUST MECHANISM FOR

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:45.390
OVERSIGHT IS IMPORTANT BOTH

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.458
MEASURES THAT TRACK PROGRESS

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:50.328
BUT THEN ALSO HOLD. INDIVIDUALS

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:52.330
ACCOUNTABLE FOR OUT CONS. SO

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:53.431
AND WE THINK THAT ANY

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:54.365
STRUCTURES ARE MOVING FORWARD

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:55.400
SHOULD HAVE THOSE MEASURES IN

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:57.668
PLACE- THE MEASURE DELAYED OUT

00:33:57.735 --> 00:33:58.536
TO SOUND REASONABLE AND WE JUST

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:00.338
THINK ANY SORT OF ROBUST-

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:03.508
PROCESS. SHOULD BE A PART OF

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:05.343
YOU KNOW ONGOING INVESTMENTS

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.577
WILL IF THERE ARE ANY OTHERS

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.513
THAT YOU ARE THE LA- THINK OF

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:11.349
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:14.419
SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND- SEE IF

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:15.453
THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ADD. I

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.522
WOULD ECHO WANTING THIS

00:34:17.588 --> 00:34:19.490
INFORMATION SOONER RATHER THAN

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:22.326
LATER TO ACTUALLY FLUSH OUT THE

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:24.495
PROPOSALS FROM THE

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:25.496
ADMINISTRATION BUT I. YOU KNOW

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.432
HAVE TO PUT MY BIASES OUT THERE

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:29.600
AS WELL I SEE HOUSING HAS

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:32.370
HEALTH. IT'S REALLY HARD TO

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:33.604
KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY IF THEY'RE

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:36.340
LIVING ON THE STREETS. AND SO I

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:38.443
THINK THERE IS LOGIC TO. BRING

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:40.545
IN THIS INTO DEPARTMENT OF

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:44.315
SOCIAL SERVICES AND- APPLAUDED

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:46.350
THE GOVERNOR FOR WANTING TO.

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.386
TAKE ON THIS CRITICAL OF AN

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:50.321
ISSUE. OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE

00:34:50.388 --> 00:34:51.556
TALKING ABOUT IT AND IT'S OUR

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:52.490
RESPONSIBILITY AS PUBLIC

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:55.326
SERVANTS TO WORK ON IT AND SO-

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:57.495
I'VE JUST ENCOURAGE THIS BODY

00:34:57.562 --> 00:34:59.464
TO CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.532
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.433
EFFECTIVE WITH THOSE DOLLARS AS

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.335
WELL SO. WITH THAT

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:05.503
ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER THANK YOU

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.438
CELESTIAL SPENT SIX THIRTY

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.340
MILLION ON HALF AND THAT MONEY

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:10.475
STILL NOT BEEN RELEASED SO IT'S

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:11.409
KIND OF HARD TO HAVE A METRIC.

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.377
IF THE MONEY IS STILL SITTING

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:15.480
THERE HAVE BEEN SPENT I AND WE

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:19.450
TALK ABOUT BUILDING IN. TWENTY

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:20.451
NINETEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:22.487
MULTI FAMILY BUILDING WAS DOWN

00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:24.522
11% SO YOU KNOW I GOVERNOR'S

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:27.358
WAS GREAT I HER A LOT. BUT YOU

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:27.959
KNOW ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS

00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:29.293
YOU CAN'T SPEND YOUR WAY OUT OF

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.595
THIS. IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:32.430
US TO GET HERE AND WE'RE NOT

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:33.598
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:34.599
I MEAN PEOPLE ARE BUILDING.

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:36.467
THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER STATE

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:37.502
BUILDINGS DOWNTOWN. A LOT OF

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:39.403
WORKERS ARE DOWN HERE SO

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.904
THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.539
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS FOR

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:44.342
HOUSING. INCOME HOUSING YOU

00:35:44.408 --> 00:35:45.610
WANT IS A STORAGE LOCAL SCHOOL

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:46.744
THE BAY AREA BECAUSE IT'S

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:47.645
ALWAYS A HIGHER THERE THE

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:48.913
COMMITTEE FROM SACRAMENTO SO

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.648
TO. THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA ALSO

00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:53.384
AND JUST PUSH A BUTTON. AND GO

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:54.585
FROM THE GROUND UP THAT'S NOT

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:57.355
GONNA HAPPEN. SO IT'S A

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:58.322
DELIBERATE EFFORT AND HOW WE DO

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:00.725
IT- AND ALSO I KNOW WE TALK

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.293
ABOUT THE SEQUEL SOMETIMES A

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.327
LOT OF FOLKS DON'T WANNA TALK

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:04.629
ABOUT IT BUT- THERE'S A PROJECT

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.397
HERE DOWNTOWN IT WAS BUILT IN

00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:08.332
NINETEEN STORY. IT WAS MIXED

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.433
USE CELL FOR WILL HOUSING IT

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.702
GOT SUED. AND WITH SOMEONE SUES

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:13.304
FOR SPEAK WITH DOCTOR FIVE

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:14.505
YEARS FOR THE TYPICAL LAWSUIT.

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:16.507
THAT YOU CAN BUILD AND CLIFF

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:18.409
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IMPAIR. MR

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:20.344
ALMOST COULD TALK ABOUT IT TOO-

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:23.381
THIS IS ALL THE TIME. YEAH YOU

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:24.448
CAN BUILD A BRAND NEW ARENA

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:28.419
DOWNTOWN. YOU CAN CONTINUE. ON

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:30.555
ITS COURSE. AND DRESS ISSUES

00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:32.557
THAT HAVE MERIT. BUT YOU CAN'T

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:33.424
FOR HOW. AND WE SEE THAT TIME

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.393
TIME AGAIN FOR BLOUSE MULTI

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.427
FAMILY HOW. PEOPLE SUING THAT

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:37.562
DON'T REALLY HAVE A VESTED

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:38.663
INTEREST. OF THEM BEING NIMBY

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:39.931
THAT DON'T WANT IT YOU KNOW IN

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:42.466
THEIR BACKYARD. IN AND HOW DO

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:44.468
WE CHANGE THAT. SO LOOK. I

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:48.439
WOULD ASK THE LA- IS- WHAT

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:49.540
SHOULD BE THE STATE'S ROLE IN

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.309
HOMELESSNESS. THAT'S A

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:53.477
DIFFICULT QUESTION- THAT'S ONE

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.478
OF THE YOU KNOW KEY I THINK

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:55.680
THAT WE SORT OF SUGGESTED

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:57.315
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:58.316
DEVELOP A STRATEGY MOVING

00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:59.650
FORWARD. WE HAVE SEEN THAT

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:01.586
HISTORICALLY THE STATE'S ROLE

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:03.321
HAS BEEN IN. PROVIDING

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:05.323
RESOURCES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:08.326
TO HELP THEM- YOU KNOW INVEST

00:37:08.392 --> 00:37:08.926
THAT MONEY LOCALLY AS THEY SEE

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.595
FIT- THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:11.495
DECISIONS YOU KNOW THE

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.530
LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE A NEW

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:13.664
APPROACH ON MOVING FORWARD IF

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:16.434
IT WANTS TO TAKE. A LARGER ROLE

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.502
IN MOVING BEYOND JUST PROVIDING

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.338
FUNDING PERHAPS DEVELOPING. YOU

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.505
KNOW POLICY DECISIONS FOR LOCAL

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:23.608
GOVERNMENTS IN THAT WOULD BE

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:24.342
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:25.543
AFFECT. NOT ONLY TO THAT THE

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:26.677
FUNDING BETTER WHAT THAT LOOKS

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:31.349
LIKE MOVING FORWARD. A LOCAL.

00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.350
HOW DOES THE GOVERNOR'S.

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.385
ADDRESS REGIONALS. ACCOUNT AND

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:36.387
NOT SPREADING MONEY TO SAN. AND

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:37.622
RESPONDING TO THE STATEMENT

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:38.689
THAT THE SAME APPROACH DOESN'T

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:41.325
WORK. HOW DOES THAT DIFFER FROM

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:43.327
THE FRAMEWORK IN HEAT AND HAPPY

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:45.396
SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:46.597
DOES ESTABLISH THESE REGIONAL

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:48.332
ENTITIES ORIGINAL

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:50.434
ADMINISTRATORS- AS ABSURD

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:52.403
MENTIONED THE TRAILER BILL- TO

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.471
THE PROBABILITY TELL ABOUT HOW

00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:54.805
THEY WOULD WORK AND SO THAT'S

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:56.407
ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS OF HOW IT

00:37:56.474 --> 00:37:58.309
IF THE- OBJECTIVE IS TO WORK IN

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:59.377
A MORE REGIONAL APPROACH HOW

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:00.311
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:03.381
AND- WORK TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:05.650
OKAY I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:07.284
THE POINT THAT WITH A LOT OF

00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:07.818
MONEY HAS NOT BEEN SPENT

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.353
PROBABLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.554
THINGS. A BILLION DOLLARS FROM

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.456
LAST YEAR CLOSE RESOLVED ALMOST

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.558
A BILLION DOLLARS ISSUE YOU CAN

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.394
BUY EVERYTHING TOGETHER SO. IT

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.361
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:18.462
TIME GETTING A DRESSED LIKE I

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:22.299
SAID. THIS IS BUILT UP- ALSO NO

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:23.434
ONE TALKS ABOUT WHICH WE KEEP

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.302
FOCUS ON HOUSING IN. AND

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:26.470
HOUSING IS IMPORTANT PART BUT-

00:38:26.537 --> 00:38:27.738
IN THE MIDDLE THIS IS A

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:29.373
CRITICAL PART. THERE'S NOT A

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.574
LOT ON THAT. AND I'LL SOME

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:32.376
PANEL TALK ABOUT LATER ON. IN

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:34.378
REALLY ALSO SUBSTANCE ABUSE YOU

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:36.313
KNOW IT'S- IT'S HARD TO GET OFF

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.315
OF DRUGS AND EVEN ALCOHOL.

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:39.450
PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME WE

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.352
RELEASE TOUR IN ARLINGTON. I

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.320
KNOW YOU MENTIONED MISSION 27%

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.289
FOR MENTAL ILLNESS. I WOULD SAY

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:46.323
THAT'S NUMBERS ARE MUCH MORE.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.526
HIGHER THAN THAT. YOU KNOW IN

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:50.494
DEALING WITH THAT AND- YOU LOOK

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:53.297
AT SACRAMENTO. AND WELL LA IS

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:54.532
DONE THEY PUT A LOT OF MONEY

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:55.466
TOWARDS IT THEMSELVES. AS WE

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:59.370
SEEN REPORTS. THE RETURN WAS A

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:02.473
VERY GOOD WITH THAT. SO LOT OF

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.475
COMPLEX THINGS LITTLE BALLS IN

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.377
THE AIR WITH THIS- AND

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:07.411
GOVERNOR'S COMMITTED- TO

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:13.350
RESOLVING THIS ISSUE BUT-

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:14.418
THERE'S A LOT TO ADDRESS. IN A

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.653
IS NOT GONNA BE THAT EASY LIKE

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.488
I SAID. THE JUST FOCUS ON

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:18.723
HOUSING HOUSING HOUSING IS

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:22.393
GOING TO. FIX A PART OF IT BUT

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:27.331
NOT THE OVERALL CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:33.337
I'M GONNA. PIGGY BACK ON THAT-

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:34.505
NO MR APPS RIGHT WE HAVE TO

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:39.343
ADDRESS. THE TREATMENT SIDE AND

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.378
WE KNOW THE FACTS THE GOVERNOR

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:42.613
MENTION YOU KNOW REALLY IN A

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.715
PROP SIXTY THREE AND HOW TO

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:46.317
ADDRESS THAT AND OBVIOUSLY WILL

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:51.355
GET AN ADULT MORE. BY YOU KNOW

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:53.491
WHEN YOU TALK TO SHARES

00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:55.459
DEPARTMENTS AND WE FIND OUT

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:57.628
NUMBERS LIKE 63% OF OUR COUNTY

00:39:57.695 --> 00:40:02.333
JAILS ARE HOUSING. MENTAL

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:03.567
HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:05.603
PATIENCE BECAUSE THERE'S

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.338
NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO BUT

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.340
YET NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT.

00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:11.308
YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONALIZING

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:13.410
FOLKS- YOU KNOW ONE FLEW OVER

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.445
THE CUCKOO'S NEST OR ANYTHING

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:16.347
LIKE THAT. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE

00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:18.415
IS. YOU KNOW WITHOUT ADDRESS

00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:21.385
SEEN PROP 47-57 TAKING THE

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:22.686
TEETH OUT OF PROGRAMS LIKE DRUG

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:25.322
COURT IN THESE THINGS. WHERE

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:26.690
IT'S YOU KNOW IT IT'S NOT

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.425
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ANY LONGER SO

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:29.827
PEOPLE ARE OUT DOING DRUGS ON

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:32.329
THE STREETS. IT'S AN AND NOW

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:33.430
THEY'RE NOT BEING FORCED TO GET

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.566
CLEANED UP. A IN THE GOVERNOR

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:37.434
MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:40.471
LOOKING AT HOW TO. PUT SOME OF

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:44.375
THAT ENFORCEMENT PIECE BACK ON.

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:46.310
BUT HE DIDN'T GO INTO DETAILS

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:47.711
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.513
THE LACK OF DETAILS ON THE LACK

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.582
OF THE MECHANICS THAT WE'VE GOT

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:54.385
A WERE BOTH LEGISLATIVELY AND

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:56.320
WITH THE DIFFERENT APARTMENTS

00:40:56.387 --> 00:41:00.324
TO FIGURE OUT OKAY. HOW

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:00.825
MECHANICALLY WE PUT THIS

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:01.425
TOGETHER HOW TO WE SAY UP THE

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:02.393
BEST TREATMENT. BECAUSE WE

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:03.627
DON'T NEED PEOPLE SITTING IN

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.296
JAIL RODDY IN. WHEN THEY NEED

00:41:05.362 --> 00:41:09.333
TREATMENT AND WE ALSO KNOW

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.368
THROUGH HISTORY THAT YOU KNOW

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:12.436
DOING THE COMMUNITY BASED OKAY

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:14.438
YEAH YOU CAN TELL SOMEBODY THEY

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:16.440
HAVE TO GO IT TREATMENT BUT IF

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:18.309
THEY HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM WHO

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.476
SAYS ARE GONNA COME BACK WAS

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:23.314
THE ENFORCEMENT ON THAT. SHOW

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.448
REALLY GOT TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:25.649
LOOK AT THESE THINGS MOVING

00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:27.318
FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT E GET

00:41:27.384 --> 00:41:29.320
ALL THE PIECES CORRECT ON THIS.

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:33.390
AND AGAIN I MEAN THE. THE

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.725
SUMMER COOPER KIND OF BEAT ME

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:36.493

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.330
FOLKS GET THE TREATMENT THAT'S

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.564
NECESSARY AND GET THEM

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.499
TRANSITION BACK INTO THE

00:41:42.566 --> 00:41:44.335
COMMUNITIES AND BACK INTO

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:45.669
SOCIETY IN BACK WHERE THEY

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:47.504
COULD BE WORKING. YOU CAN'T

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:51.375
JUST FROM A HOUSE. IN SOME OF

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:52.409
THE STREAMING OPTIONS ARE GONNA

00:41:52.476 --> 00:41:54.411
TAKE NO YEARS FOR SOME OF THESE

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:56.480
FOLKS SO WE REALLY NEED TO

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:57.648
FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THAT

00:41:57.715 --> 00:42:00.384
TREATMENT SIDE AND YOU KNOW

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:01.318
IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:03.320
DEVELOP THESE HOUSES PLUS THE

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:04.521
WORK FORCE PLUS EVERYTHING

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:06.657
ELSE. PLUS THE FACT THAT WE

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:08.492
HAVE A SHORTAGE ON MENTAL

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:09.793
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.528
STATE AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:14.331
IT'S- YOU THERE'S NOT A BUTTON

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:15.532
ARE SWITCH JUST THE PORTION

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.401
IT'S MAGICALLY KANAB HERE YOU

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:18.702
HAVE TO BUILD AND ALL THE

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:21.338
PIECES TO GET US UP TO THAT.

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:23.507
THAT WE'VE LOST OVER THE LAST

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:25.376
COUPLE OF DECADES SO I KNOW

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:28.512
THAT'S A LOT ALL AT ONCE. BUT I

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:30.648
MEAN. WE HAVE TO FIGURE THIS

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:33.384
OUT AND MAKE SURE THE MECHANICS

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.520
ARE GONNA WORK. WERE EVERYTHING

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:37.388
FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS YET

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:40.424
AGAIN. A INTERN NOT GONNA SPEND

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.326
YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS SO I MEAN

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:43.360
AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WE LOOK

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:46.430
IT. THE PROPOSALS I THINK WE'RE

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.399
REALLY GONNA NEED. AS

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:50.301
LEGISLATIVE BODY HELP MAKING

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:51.468
SURE THOSE MECHANICAL PIECES

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:54.438
FIT TOGETHER RIGHT. SO THESE

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:59.443
PROGRAMS ACTUALLY WORK- BECAUSE

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.344
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A PROGRAM.

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:02.313
BUT IF IT THE MECHANICS DON'T

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:05.282
WORK IT'S USELESS. AND AS WE'VE

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.484
SEEN BEFORE. AS MENTIONED

00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:09.320
EARLIER WE CAN HAVE A PROGRAM

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:10.387
BUT IF THERE'S NO FUNDING AND

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:12.323
IT IS JUST AN AT THE SHELL SO

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:13.324
IT'S A GREAT HEADLINE BUT IT

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:15.292
DOES NOTHING. SO WE'VE GOT TO

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.593
MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW IS NOT

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.330
AN EMPTY SHELVES AND THE PIECES

00:43:19.396 --> 00:43:21.465
OFF IT NETWORKS SHALL. I LOOK

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:25.402
FORWARD TO. PUTTING ALL OF THAT

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:26.770
TOGETHER OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.439
MONTHS. SPEAKING OF PUTTING

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:29.440
PIECES TOGETHER WE HAVE A

00:43:29.506 --> 00:43:32.309
QUORUM OF SUB ONE AND SO I JUST

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:32.943
WANT TO TAKE ROLE FOR THAT IF I

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.447
CAN. DR AMBULANCE PRESENT

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:40.317
FRAZIER. MATHIS HATTERS. RAMOS

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:44.488
RUBIO DOCTOR WOULD. I WOULD

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:45.489
JUST ASK IF THERE ANY OTHER WE

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:47.424
HAVE FOR LA- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:51.695
AND THEN. SO FOR SOMEONE THANK

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:53.397
YOUR ANALYSIS I KNOW YOU'VE

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:53.964
COME OUT WITH THE NUMBER OF

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:55.532
RECENT. AND PRE. APPRECIATE

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:58.435
THAT- IN THE MOST RECENT REPORT

00:43:58.502 --> 00:44:00.304
THAT CAME OUT ON FEB ELEVENTH-

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:03.307
BY ONE OF YOUR TOP LEVEL-

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:05.409
CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THE PLAN

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.311
RUN HOMELESSNESS LACKS COHESION

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:09.413
IS FRAGMENTED EXCEPT FOR A AND-

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.647
PART OF THE REASON WHY I KNOW

00:44:10.714 --> 00:44:12.649
THE CHAIRS OF THESE COMMITTEES

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:14.451
PUT THIS TOGETHER IS. HOUSING

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:16.320
IS HEALTH HEALTH IS HOUSING-

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.554
BUT AS WAS JUST MENTIONED BY

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:18.589
SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES THE

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:19.556
INTERSECTION BETWEEN

00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.425
HOMELESSNESS AND THE HEALTH

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:23.293
CARE SYSTEM THE FOSTER CARE

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.328
SYSTEM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:27.331
SYSTEM- THE DISABILITIES SAFETY

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:29.299
NET. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:31.301
EXCEPT FOR ALL SILOS THAT WE

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.669
WANT TO FIGURE OUT A BREAKDOWN.

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:36.273
OF THE ONE ASK YOU WHETHER YOU

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.508
THINK THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:39.443
AND SENT DIFFERENT POLICY

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.311
COMMUNITIES AND DIFFERENT

00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:43.313
BUREAUCRACIES WITHIN GOVERNMENT

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.615
TO DO BETTER WORK TOGETHER TO

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:46.650
FOCUS ON. THE PLIGHT OF FOLKS

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:48.385
WHO ARE HOMELESS BUT ALSO ARE

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:50.320
INTERACTING WITH DIFFERENT

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:51.388
POLICY SALAS ARE THERE IT

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:53.424
OBVIOUSLY YOUR SUGGESTION IS

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.625
RIGHT NOW WE'RE FRAGMENTED

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.360
RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT COHESIVE.

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:57.828
IS THERE A BETTER WAY FOR US TO

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:58.662
AFTER THAT AND I WOULD JUST SAY

00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:00.564
FOR OTHER PANELS THAT ARE

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:02.332
COMING TO SPEAK IF ANYONE HAS

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:04.435
IDEAS ON THIS FROM MY

00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:05.369
PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE ARE

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:09.306
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SYSTEM

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:13.310
THAT. ARE HELPING. THE END OF

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.611
WE WANT TO HELP BUT BE THEY'RE

00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:17.347
TO. WE'RE NOT DOING JOB I'M-

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:18.549

THOSE ARE TOUGH TRADE OFF THE

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:41.371
DECIDING WHICH POPULATIONS TO

WHAT THE TRADEOFFS OF SPREADING

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:51.315
DOLLARS MORE THINLY MIGHT BE-

OF THE FIRST DECISIONS THE

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:11.568
THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE STATE

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:14.271

ALMOST. THANK YOU MISTER

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:39.463
CHAIRMAN FOLLOWING UP ON THE

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.565
LOWER ASK OF IT CERTAINLY HEARD

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.433
THE GOVERNOR A STATED THE STATE

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.601
TO AND TALKED ABOUT HOMELESS

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:45.536
MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALL TALK

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:48.305
ABOUT IN THAT LOCAL LEVEL WERE-

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.641
WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THAT

00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:52.376
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT THERE BUT

00:46:52.442 --> 00:46:54.444
YET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:57.381
HEALTH IN THOSE ARE OUT ON THE

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:59.383
STREET. AND NOW WHERE DO WE PUT

00:46:59.449 --> 00:47:01.318
THEM AT WRITING SO I KEEP

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:02.319
TALKING ABOUT CRISIS

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:04.321
STABILIZATION UNITS AS A PLACE

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.323
TO. HAVE AN OPTION FOR FIRST

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.491
RESPONDERS WHEN THEY RESPOND

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:08.625
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

00:47:08.692 --> 00:47:10.627
FIREFIGHTERS. WHEN THEY GOAL

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:12.262
RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:14.298
COUNTY JIL OR TO THE EMERGENCY

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:17.501
ROOM FOR A SEVENTY TWO HOUR

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:18.835
HOLD. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AN

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:19.603
OP TO HIM TO STABILIZATION

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.305
UNITS HOWEVER CRISIS

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:23.440
STABILIZATION UNITS ARE LIMITED

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.609
IN THE TIME OF DAY THAT YOU CAN

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:26.643
ACTUALLY SPEND THERE I THINK

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:29.346
IT'S TWELVE DAYS. NOT SURE WHAT

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:31.415
WE NEED IS LONGER LONG TERM

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:33.383
CRISIS RESIDENCY TREATMENTS SO

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.385
WHEN WE START TO MOVE DOWN THIS

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:37.321
ROAD OF HOMELESSNESS AND

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:38.589
PARTICULARLY HOT MENTAL HEALTH

00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:40.324
HOMELESSNESS OUT. IN OUR

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.326
COMMUNITIES THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:45.462
OF LONG TERM RESIDENCY

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:47.464
TREATMENT NEEDS TO BE ONE THAT

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:48.298
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:50.367
BECAUSE NOT WHEN FIRST WRIST TO

00:47:50.434 --> 00:47:52.603
RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE

00:47:52.669 --> 00:47:54.304
EPISODES THE ONLY OPTION

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.539
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE IN LESS THAN

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.274
INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE IS

00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:59.276
STILL A COUNTY JAILS OR THE

00:47:59.343 --> 00:48:00.377
EMERGENCY ROOM BACKING UP. AT

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:02.412
THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT IN THE

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:04.314
IMPACT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:06.316
THAT'S THERE SO WE TALK ABOUT

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:08.285
BRINGING SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:09.553
TOGETHER AND I HEAR YOU TALKING

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.388
ABOUT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. NOT

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:13.323
TO BE SO HASTY AND JUMPING

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.492
FORWARD BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:16.693
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LAYING THE

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.295
GROUND BREAKING IN THE

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:20.597
DISCUSSION FOR SOME OF THESE

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:21.465
LONG TERM APPROACH THAT WOULD

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:23.667
BUILD SOME OF THESE CRISIS

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.369
DOESN'T TREATMENTS THERE'S-

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:28.472
LOCAL. AREAS THAT. TO THAT THAT.

00:48:28.538 --> 00:48:32.309
OF NIMBY IS A AND NOT AND BACK

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:37.514
THIS AND THAT WELL WE KNOW THAT

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.115
IT'S ENOUGH PUNISHED FOR PROP

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:42.552
EVERY STE. I'M IN THE STATE

00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:44.521
HELLO I'M NOT FIFTY COUNTY. BUT

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:48.358
YOU. TACKLE THAT ISSUE THAT'S

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:48.959
NOT BE DISCUSS OF A YOU HAVE

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:50.327
THE RESOURCE TO PUT UP Mà.

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:52.262
WHOSE BE THE FIRST OR FOR

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:53.430
CITIES A BUILD IT IN OUR

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:54.431
BACKYARD THAT'S ONE OF ISSUES

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:55.699
WE HAVE TO. WE ARE AND IN A

00:48:55.766 --> 00:49:00.370
HOME VETS AREA DOWN IN IN

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:01.538
DECEMBER DINO AND ONE OF THE

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:03.307
CITIES AND CEREMONIAL COUNTY.

00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:05.375
AND IT WAS EIGHTY UNITS FOR

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:07.477
HOMELESS VETERANS BUT YET WHEN

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:08.645
WE HAD TWENTY FIVE MILLION

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:12.316
DOLLARS RATED BOTH FOR IT. THE

00:49:12.382 --> 00:49:13.517
IN THE MIDEAST UP AND SAID.

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:15.319
MAYBE CALL FOR A BETTER FOR IT.

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:17.321
WE ENDED UP LOSING THE FUNDING

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:19.289
FOR THAT WHOLE DEVELOPMENT. SO

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:21.258
WHEN THE GOVERNOR TALKS ABOUT

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.459
LOOKING AT THE SURPLUS LAND IN

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:24.461
THE STATE. THAT COULD BE THE

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:27.297
SOLUTION TO THE REGIONAL

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:28.498
APPROACH THAT TAKES AWAY THAT

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:30.434

SETTINGS AND THIS YEAR'S

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.625
PROPOSAL REALLY FOCUSES ON

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.427
ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM I'M IN

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.297
IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY-

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.531
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUND IN

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.366

THAT MANY OF THEIR ARRESTS ARE

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.557
REALLY AT THE ROOT OF THE

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:22.692
CONDITION OF THEIR HOME THIS IN

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:24.393

THE SILOS AND FUNDING STREAMS

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:03.452
AND- THINK THAT THE ENHANCED

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.488
CARE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS IN

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.329
BY HELPING TO MEET PEOPLE'S.

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:17.266
TRUE NEEDS AND SO I APPRECIATE

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:21.270
THE- EFFORT THAT WAS PUT INTO.

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:23.272
CRAFTING SOMETHING THIS LARGE

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.274
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:28.310
HOW WE CAN. HELP TO MAKE SURE

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:32.415
THAT IT WORKS AND SO AND THAT'S

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:34.316
WHERE I WANT TO COME BACK IF I

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.351
COULD TO JENNIFER TORIA. YOU

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:37.286
HAD ALLUDED TO A REGION

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.321
EMPLOYING A BEST PRACTICE AND I

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:45.294
THINK THAT THE- C. A. H. S. IS.

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:46.395
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WAS THE

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.264
FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.299
IN LOS ANGELES AND SO WAS

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:52.301
HOPING THAT YOU COULD TALK A

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.403
LITTLE BIT THERE WAS A RAND

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.338
STUDY THAT WAS PER. INSTALL FOR

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:59.341
WILL HELP PEOPLE. WHAT THE

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:00.443
RESULTS OF THAT STUDY WERE AND

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:04.280
WHY IT'S A GOOD. EXAMPLE FOR US

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:06.515
TO LOOK AT ABOUT WHAT'S

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.551
POSSIBLE BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING

01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:11.287
TO SELECT THAT AS WHAT COULD

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.289
HAPPEN TO OUR REGION WE SHOULD

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:16.459
EXPLAIN. WHY IT WAS IDENTIFIED

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:18.394
AS THE BEST PRACTICE AND NOT TO

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:21.263
START THEIR- YEAH SO LOS

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.399
ANGELES IS NOT THE ONLY- REGION

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:24.500
IN THE STATE OR AREA IN THE

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:27.303
STATE THAT HAS- EMPLOYED SUCH A

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:28.504
PRACTICE I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO

01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:30.372
IN SAN FRANCISCO AND A FEW

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.542
OTHERS AS WELL. EXCUSE ME ALL

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.376
OF THESE JURISDICTIONS THEY

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.445
WERE DOING- SOMETHINGS THAT ARE

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:37.680
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.348
AND SOME THAT ARE DIFFERENT- SO

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.283
SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES ARE

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:43.419
THE ARE THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:44.420
FUNDING AND ALSO ANOTHER

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.288
SIMILARITY- IT. IN MANY CASES

01:08:46.355 --> 01:08:48.357
THE BLENDING IN BRICK BEING OF

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.359
MULTIPLE FUNDS SURCES- AND

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.495
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:54.263
HOPE TO REPLICATE- THE IDEA

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.464
BEING THAT. EXCESS FULL ABOUT

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:57.366
THOUGHT IS THAT IT ALLOWS. BOTH

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:59.435
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AND ALSO

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:02.404
ALLOWS TO HAVE- FEWER BARRIERS

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.340
BASED ON THE RESTRICT ANY

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.275
INDIVIDUAL FUND SOURCE BECAUSE

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:08.277
YOU CAN MIX THE FUNDS AS-

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:11.347
THIRTY INDIVIDUAL PER TING TO

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.281
YEAR HAS. SEVERAL DIFFERENT

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:17.286
NEEDS AND WHAT FUND SOURCE CAN

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:19.388
BE UTILIZED TO MEET THAT NEED

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:22.358
BUT ANOTHER STORY. NICE TO MEET

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:24.627
DIFFERENT. YOU CAN MIX TOGETHER.

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:28.297
AND SEEM TO THE- AN OR PERSON.

01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:30.266
I BUT BEHIND THIS. IS AT THE

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.400
ENTITIES CAN IN NETWORK TO MAKE

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:32.368
SURE WE'RE MEETING THEIR NEEDS.

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:35.271
ASSEMBLY WAY WE INTEND TO ALLOW

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:44.280
FOR FLEXIBILITY AND GAP FILLING.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.447
TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:46.348
COULD ABOUT THE RAND STUDY IN

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:48.384
WHY I THAT PANEL IT IT IT

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:51.387
SHOULD THE RESIDENT ON. THAT

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.621
EVERY DOLLAR LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.290
AND THEY WERE SAVING A DOLLAR

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:56.292
TWENTY AND- OTHER HEALTH CARE

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.360
RELATED COSTS IN THE OUR VISITS

01:09:58.427 --> 01:09:59.562
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:01.597
ABUSE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:05.267
FULLY CAPTURES AS WELL. COSTS

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:07.269
THAT COULD BE FROM JAILS OR

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:08.437
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRISON AS

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:11.373
WELL AND SO I. LOOK TO THAT IS

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.342
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW WE-

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:16.412
SHOULD BE. LOOKING AT HOW WE-

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:19.348
SPEND OUR LIMITED RESOURCES IN

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:21.283
A WAY THAT BOTH EFFECTIVE AND

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:24.486
ACCOUNTABLE SO. WITH THAT THE

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:26.655
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH THANK YOU

WHO IS IN CHARGE. THE REGION'S

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.639
ALSO HOW DO WE KNOW THE CURRENT

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.407
STRUCTURE DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:46.041
YOU GUYS SIGNED OFF ON HAPPENED

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:47.576
LAST YEAR. WHEN HE HASN'T BEEN

TODAY THAT HE BELIEVES WE STILL

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.391
DO NEED TO INNOVATE AND THAT

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:03.592
THIS IS- BUILDING ON THE

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.294
SUCCESS OF THOSE PROGRAMS I

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.262

THERE'S NO SUCCESS RIGHT NOW.

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:16.271
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ARE ARE

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:17.506

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.342
FOR THE ENTITY THAT ARE

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:23.345
ADMINISTERING THEM BUT I WILL

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:25.447
SAY THAT- SO. ON OUR- THIS IS

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.483
THE- ALRIGHT. IN FOR HE FOR

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:29.284
EXAMPLE AND IN PRIOR YEARS AS

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:32.287
WELL SO- IN THIS CASE WE ARE

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:33.522
SAYING WE WANT TO USE A NEW

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:34.723
MODEL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:36.291
THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO BE AN

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:37.493
INNOVATION AND A NEW MODEL

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.328
HAVING SAID THAT IT'S MEANT TO

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:40.262
BUILD ON THE COLLABORATIONS

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:42.297
THAT ALREADY EXIST SO THE FUND

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:42.765
PURPOSES ARE SLIGHTLY

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:44.333
DIFFERENT. STRUCTURE IS

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.501
DIFFERENT BUT THE LOCAL

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.369
PARTNERS ARE THE SAME LOCAL

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:50.272
PARTNER NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.341
ALL OF THE- MACINNES. SO WE

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:53.509
EXPECT THAT THE REGIONAL

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:56.278
ADMINISTRATORS WILL COLLABORATE

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:59.281
WITH CITIES COUNTIES CEO SEES

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:01.350
AND OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES- IN

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:02.451
SOME CASES THE REGIONAL

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:03.652
ADMINISTRATORS MAY BE THOSE

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:07.289
ENTITIES- SO THAT IS NOT. A

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:08.524
DEPARTURE OR A CHANGE IN

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.260
COURSE- THE FINDING AND HOW IT

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:12.227
FLOWS AND HOW THE

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:13.328
ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS ARE

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:18.400
THEN. IMPLEMENTED. IT'S BEEN UP

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:19.535

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:21.270
MISATTRIBUTED THERE NO DETAILS

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:23.272
YET ON THAT. AND I'LL SEE HAVE

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:24.406

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:31.413
NOTHING TO. SUBSTANTIAL TO MOVE

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.382

BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:38.287
SUCCESSFUL MODEL OF ADDING

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:40.355
AGAIN ANOTHER GAP FILLER SO

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:42.357
WOULD HE BEEN HACKED AND OTHER

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.293
RESOURCES DO EXIST LOCALLY WE

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:45.260
HAVE FEDERAL FUNDING STREAMS.

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:46.428

ARE CERTAINLY THERE SO AN

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:21.529
EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT WE

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:22.396

BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S COMMENT

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:46.340
THAT HE WANTS DOCTORS TO BE

ABLE TO WRITE. PRESCRIPTIONS

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:50.344
FOR HOUSING- AS THE AUTHOR OF

CALIFORNIA LAW THAT WE HAVE-

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:55.249
VERY INTRIGUED BY THIS. I

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:57.384
THINK. THE QUESTION IS REALLY

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:59.220
HOW WOULD THIS HAPPEN AND

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:02.456
SPECIFICALLY- MY UNDERSTANDING

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:03.491
IS THAT CHANGES TO MEDICARE HOW

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:05.226
WOULD REQUIRE. MANAGED

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:07.294
PROVIDERS TO OFFER CIRCLE IN

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:08.429
LIEU FEES LIKE RENTAL

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:09.530
ASSISTANCE. CAPTION OCCASION

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:13.234
CENTERS THAT THE SERVICES-

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.202
HOUSING MISSING STAINING

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:16.337
SERVICES EXCEPT TRUCK. SEEMS

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:18.239
LIKE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

01:36:18.305 --> 01:36:19.373
STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENT TO SAY

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.442
THAT DOCTORS DOCTOR RAMBLE IS

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:24.311
THE WORLD. WOULD HAVE TO OR- BE

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:25.446
CALM EXPERTS AND HOW TO

01:36:25.513 --> 01:36:27.448
NAVIGATE. HOUSING SYSTEMS HOW

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.416
HOW WOULD THIS HAPPEN. HOW THIS

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:31.318
ACTUALLY HAPPEN SHORES SO IT

01:36:31.385 --> 01:36:32.520
REALLY IS UNDER ALTHOUGH I KNOW

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:36.257
DOCTOR. WILL BE ABLE TO FIGURE.

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:37.458
AND I THINK IT GOES UNDER THE

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:39.260
CA OF. FOR HEALTH SO ON IF YOU

01:36:39.326 --> 01:36:40.227
HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:42.229

HOMELESS- AND HAVE NO HOUSING

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:57.645
IT'S VERY HARD FOR THEM TO

01:36:57.711 --> 01:36:59.246
FOCUS ON THEIR DIABETES OR

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:00.514

HAPPENING ALREADY TO DAY AND I

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:36.521

IS WE'RE WE'RE DOING A

02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:47.332
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. WE NEED TO

02:11:47.399 --> 02:11:50.202
DO MUCH MORE TO DEAL WITH THE

02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:52.170
SCALE OF THE ISSUE AND REALLY

02:11:52.237 --> 02:11:54.306
TO GET UPSTREAM OF SOMEONE

02:11:54.373 --> 02:11:57.175
ENDING UP IN THAT. ONE FOURTH

SUBSET CHRONICALLY ILL

02:11:59.244 --> 02:12:01.280
POPULATION- BECAUSE WE'VE

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:03.215
TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW WE'RE

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:04.549
NOT GOING TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT

02:12:04.616 --> 02:12:06.251
OF THIS WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:12:06.318 --> 02:12:07.219
SPEND OUR WAY OUT OF IT I

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:09.254
ACTUALLY TAKE ISSUE WITH AND

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:10.222
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND OUR

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:11.356
WAY OUT OF IT. I THINK YOU KNOW

02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:13.191
WE CAN TALK HAVE CONVERSATION

02:12:13.258 --> 02:12:14.293
ABOUT REDIRECTING FUNDS

02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:16.295
SHIFTING FRIENDS FROM THIS

02:12:16.361 --> 02:12:18.263
PRIORITY TO THAT PRIORITY BUT

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:20.265
ULTIMATELY THERE IS MONEY THAT

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:24.169
IS PROVEN TO BE WELL SPENT THAT-IS ON THE GROUNDS TODAY. AND

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:26.238
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED TO

02:12:26.305 --> 02:12:28.206
DO MUCH MORE TO ADDRES THE

02:12:28.273 --> 02:12:31.243
BROADER VOLUME UP THE ISSUE AND

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:33.245
I THINK THAT WHEN OUR FOLKS ARE

02:12:33.312 --> 02:12:35.213
SOME OF THE ONLY PEOPLE OUT

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:36.448
THERE. THERE IS A BROADER GROUP

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:38.283
OF PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED. WHO

02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:40.285
ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE BEING

02:12:40.352 --> 02:12:43.422
HOMELESS IS NOT FUN EXPERIENCE

02:12:43.488 --> 02:12:44.289
IT'S HARD AND IT DOESN'T HAVE

02:12:44.356 --> 02:12:45.223
AN IMPACT ON YOUR MENTAL. THAT

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:47.259
PERSON IS DEALING WITH THEM THE

02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:47.893
WHOLE PROBLEMS THAT COME ALONG

02:12:47.959 --> 02:12:49.294
WITH BEING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:12:49.361 --> 02:12:51.363
SURVIVOR WITH BEING ASKED TO

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.531
LEAVE YOUR HOME BECAUSE YOU

02:12:52.597 --> 02:12:54.166
CAME OUT AS- TRANSGENDER OR-

02:12:54.232 --> 02:12:56.201
CLEAR. THOSE SORTS OF MENTAL

02:12:56.268 --> 02:12:58.270
HEALTH EFFECTS DO NOT MEAN THAT

02:12:58.337 --> 02:12:59.404
THAT PERSON IS SERIOUSLY

02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:00.572
MENTALLY ILL IT DOES NOT MEAN

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:01.640
THAT THEY HAVE A PSYCHOTIC

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:03.175
CONDITION IT MEANS THAT THEY

02:13:03.241 --> 02:13:05.210
ARE. SUFFERING HOWEVER AND SO

02:13:05.277 --> 02:13:07.179
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US

02:13:07.245 --> 02:13:09.181
GIVEN THAT OUR FUNDING IS TIED

02:13:09.247 --> 02:13:15.287
TO SIR. THE MOST OF. SO TO BE

02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:19.424
OF A OR TO TRY TO FOR OTHER%

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:22.194
SALUTE. AND OTHERS SIMPLY TO

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:24.429
EXIST. WE THINK THAT THERE IS A

02:13:24.496 --> 02:13:26.365
WAY TO DO THIS ON A COMP. LEVEL

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:28.233
WHAT DO WANT TO DO IS PICK WAS

02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:29.167
A REAL IMPORTANT PREVENTION.

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:29.701
WHETHER IT'S RENTAL IS. OR

02:13:29.768 --> 02:13:31.336
BUILDING NEW UNITS OR DOING

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:33.171
ANYTHING ON THE PREVENTION SIDE

02:13:33.238 --> 02:13:34.373
BOOSTING THE SS I RATES AT

02:13:34.439 --> 02:13:35.540
CENTER WE DON'T WANT TO PICK

02:13:35.607 --> 02:13:37.409
THAT AGAINST WHAT WE NEED FOR

02:13:37.476 --> 02:13:38.510
THE MOST TO Q. AND OF THE

02:13:38.577 --> 02:13:40.379
SPECTRUM. SO ONE OF OUR

02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:42.247
CAUTIONS WITH THE FLEXIBLE FUND

02:13:42.314 --> 02:13:44.416
IS ALLOWING SOME OTHER ENTITY

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:46.451
THAT'S NOT REALLY SORT OF

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:48.253
GROUNDED IN THE NEEDS OF. OUR

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:50.322
SPECIFIC SUB POPULATION TO CALL

02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:52.457
IT IN TERMS OF THE BOARDING

02:13:52.524 --> 02:13:54.192
NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY. BECAUSE

02:13:54.259 --> 02:13:55.360
I WANT TO COMPETE WITH THE

02:13:55.427 --> 02:13:57.162
RENTAL SUBSIDIES RIGHT I MEAN

02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:58.563
BOTH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BOTH

02:13:58.630 --> 02:14:00.298
ARE NECESSARY TO GETTING US OUT

02:14:00.365 --> 02:14:02.300
OF HERE SO WE EITHER THINK A

02:14:02.367 --> 02:14:04.269
DEDICATED POT OF FUNDING FOR

02:14:04.336 --> 02:14:05.470
BORDER BOARDING CARE WITHIN THE

FLEXIBLE FUND. OR SOMETHING

02:14:08.407 --> 02:14:10.175
ELSE TO THIS TO SORT OF LIFT

02:14:10.242 --> 02:14:12.277
THEM LET US MAKE IT LARGER IS

02:14:12.344 --> 02:14:14.279
APPROPRIATE I ALSO WANT TO.

02:14:14.346 --> 02:14:17.315
THAT WE HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR TWO

02:14:17.382 --> 02:14:19.184
HUNDRED FIFTEEN TO FIVE AB INTO

LARGE CITIES- AND- YOU KNOW I

02:22:04.449 --> 02:22:06.317
WILL JUST. REPRESENT A LITTLE

02:22:06.384 --> 02:22:09.153
MORE OF A RURAL AREA AS WELL AS

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:11.189
I DO RECOGNIZE FRESNO WAS ONE

02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:12.457
OF THOSE THIRTEEN LARGEST

02:22:12.523 --> 02:22:15.260
CITIES. BUT SAN JOAQUIN AND

02:22:15.326 --> 02:22:18.263
TRANQUILITY AND FOWLER AREAS

02:22:18.329 --> 02:22:20.431
THAT ALSO ARE STRUGGLING WITH

02:22:20.498 --> 02:22:23.401
HOMELESSNESS THAT. WILL NOT AND

02:22:23.468 --> 02:22:25.136
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO.

02:22:25.203 --> 02:22:26.304
REPRESENT ALL OF THE

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:29.240
COMMUNITIES THAT I HAVE AND LET

02:22:29.307 --> 02:22:30.174
ME START BY SAYING THANK YOU

02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:31.242
VERY MUCH AND AS YOU CAN SEE

02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:32.176
THERE'S DIFFERENT PROPOSALS

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:33.444
HERE UP BUT AS WE WERE TALKING

02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:34.579
ABOUT THE TWO BILLION BASICALLY

02:22:34.646 --> 02:22:36.314
WE TOOK IT IS WHAT WE TOOK A

02:22:36.381 --> 02:22:37.181
LOOK AT THAT THE WAY TO KEEP.

02:22:37.248 --> 02:22:38.383
THE STRUCTURE AND THE HAVE

02:22:38.449 --> 02:22:39.417
DOLLARS A STRUCTURED AND

02:22:39.484 --> 02:22:41.386
FOLLOWED. THROUGH THAT

02:22:41.452 --> 02:22:42.520
TRADITION BECAUSE THE

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:43.588
LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY WORKED

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:46.357
ON ON ON THAT AND SO I MEAN

02:22:46.424 --> 02:22:47.558
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS THE BEGINNING

02:22:47.625 --> 02:22:49.127
OF A PROPOSAL BUT WE THOUGHT

02:22:49.193 --> 02:22:50.228
THE BEST PLACE TO START IS

02:22:50.295 --> 02:22:52.330
WHERE WE LEFT OFF OVER THE LAST

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:54.299
SEVERAL YEARS AND- IN IN I KNOW

02:22:54.365 --> 02:22:55.466
I DON'T NEED REMINDED BUT FOR

02:22:55.533 --> 02:22:56.501
THE SAKE OF THE CONVERSATION

02:22:56.567 --> 02:22:58.202
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OFF WAIT

02:22:58.269 --> 02:22:59.404
WITH HE OLLARS. IT WAS ON THE

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:01.239
CONTINUUM OF CARE AND THE

02:23:01.306 --> 02:23:02.473
CITIES AND THEN IT WAS EXTENDED

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:04.542
LAST YEAR TO SIX FIFTY WITH THE

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:06.144
CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES

02:23:06.210 --> 02:23:08.212
OF CARE- AND SO WE FOLLOW TO

02:23:08.279 --> 02:23:09.213
WHAT IT WHAT IS NEW HERE I

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.248
DON'T REMEMBER FROM THE PAST

02:23:10.315 --> 02:23:12.216
WAS THE FIVE PERCENT. OF

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:14.285
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE IN

02:23:14.352 --> 02:23:18.589
CITY. HE'S A PORTION OF IT BUT

02:23:18.656 --> 02:23:19.724
THE CAN. OF CARE IS A FAR AS I

02:23:19.791 --> 02:23:21.259
AS FAR AS I. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO.

02:23:21.326 --> 02:23:22.493
THE WORK ON THIS DOESN'T

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:24.429
NECESSARILY. DEFINE WHAT THAT

02:23:24.495 --> 02:23:26.264
IS AT THIS POINT IN TIME. ON IN

02:23:26.331 --> 02:23:30.401
SO IN. AN ATTIC THINK THAT'S

02:23:30.468 --> 02:23:31.002
PROBABLY LEGAL IF YOU LIKE TO

02:23:31.069 --> 02:23:36.174
ADD. JUST FOR- CLEAR THE I DO

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:37.308
THINK HE HAS GONE OUT AND

02:23:37.375 --> 02:23:39.510
HAPPENS NOT CRAMMED SO WE'RE

02:23:39.577 --> 02:23:42.246
STRUGGLING TO. THOSE ALIGNED

02:23:42.313 --> 02:23:45.216
WITH OUR STATEMENTS OVERALL BUT

02:23:45.283 --> 02:23:47.151
JUST WANTED TO CREATE THAT. YOU

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:47.752

THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND HE'D

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:56.327
FUNDING I BELIEVE. THE FINAL

02:23:56.394 --> 02:23:59.230
PERCENTAGE THAT WENT TO YOUTH

02:23:59.297 --> 02:24:01.399
WAS ROUGHLY 10% IS THERE A

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:05.169
THOUGHT TO HAVE ENSURING THAT

02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:06.204
THERE'S ALSO A FOCUS ON THE

02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:08.272
YOUNGER SPECTRUM WITHIN THIS

02:24:08.339 --> 02:24:11.209

BRIEF COMMENTS- FIRST OF ALL I

02:27:06.484 --> 02:27:08.386
WANT TO. HARDLY ENDORSE THE

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:10.188
COMMENTS BY MISS CABRERA. I

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:13.324
THOUGHT THEY WERE- SOMETHING

02:27:13.391 --> 02:27:14.659
THE COMMITTEE SHOULD REALLY

02:27:14.725 --> 02:27:16.160
TAKE TO HEART I THINK THERE WAS

02:27:16.227 --> 02:27:17.428
A LOT OF TRUTH IN THAT AND I

02:27:17.495 --> 02:27:19.297
THINK. MUCH OF WHAT SHE SAID I

02:27:19.363 --> 02:27:20.431
THINK SHOULD HELP GROUNDWORK

02:27:20.498 --> 02:27:22.366
THAT YOU AND OTHERS ARE GOING

02:27:22.433 --> 02:27:23.167

COMMEND THE GOVERNOR AND THE

02:27:26.537 --> 02:27:28.239
DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES FOR

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:30.174
THEIR WORK ON THIS. I THINK THE

02:27:30.241 --> 02:27:31.375
PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:33.144
BRING FORTH IN THIS ARE VERY

02:27:33.211 --> 02:27:34.345
BOLD AND INNOVATIVE. I THINK IN

02:27:34.412 --> 02:27:38.216
PARTICULAR. HE HIS CALL FOR

02:27:41.452 --> 02:27:44.155
LONG OVERDUE. AND I HAVE EVERY

02:27:44.222 --> 02:27:46.290
CONFIDENCE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE

02:27:46.357 --> 02:27:47.191
ABLE TO MANAGE THOSE WHILE WE

02:27:47.258 --> 02:27:49.193
SAW HOW EFFECTIVELY. THEY WERE

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:51.195
ABLE TO HANDLE THE ESPY CASH

02:27:51.262 --> 02:27:51.696
OUT ROLL OUT THEY DID AN

02:27:51.762 --> 02:27:53.297
AMAZING JOB. AND I HAVE

02:27:53.364 --> 02:27:54.532

CITIES HCV SHOULD BE INVOLVED

02:41:02.219 --> 02:41:03.520

WE WILL GET INTO THE STRUCTURE

02:41:48.432 --> 02:41:50.200
OF THE PROPOSAL BUT I THINK ONE

02:41:50.267 --> 02:41:51.201
THING WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN

02:41:51.268 --> 02:41:54.404
TERMS OF THE SS. STRUCTURE PER

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:56.339
PER. BASICALLY IS THAT. RIGHT

02:41:56.406 --> 02:41:58.241
NOW WE'RE LOSING BOARD CARE

02:41:58.308 --> 02:42:00.243
HOMES AT A TERRIFIC RATE. AND

02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:02.145
YOU KNOW TO COUNTIES ARE DOING

02:42:02.212 --> 02:42:03.480
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I KNOW ONE

02:42:03.547 --> 02:42:06.149
ALAMEDA COUNTY- WE'VE BEEN ABLE

02:42:06.216 --> 02:42:08.251
TO FIND MONEY FROM THE- POP

02:42:08.318 --> 02:42:10.120
SIXTY THREE FUNDS IN ORDER

02:42:10.187 --> 02:42:11.455
INCREASES TYPE IN ALREADY FOR

02:42:11.521 --> 02:42:13.256
BOARDING CARE HOMES TO KEEP

02:42:13.323 --> 02:42:14.091
THEM FROM GOING OUT OF

02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:15.192
BUSINESS. I THINK THE SAN

02:42:15.258 --> 02:42:17.227
FRANCISCO IS ALSO WORKING ON

02:42:17.294 --> 02:42:18.128
THIS AND THEY'RE ALSO BUYING

02:42:18.195 --> 02:42:20.230
FACILITIES AT THIS POINT THAT

02:42:20.297 --> 02:42:21.565
ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS

02:42:21.631 --> 02:42:22.365
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE- IS

02:42:22.432 --> 02:42:25.135
A REAL PREVENTION ISSUE HERE-

02:42:25.202 --> 02:42:27.237
TO THE EXTENT WE LOSE THESE

02:42:27.304 --> 02:42:28.238

KNOW WE GOT MORE PEOPLE ON THE

02:42:30.273 --> 02:42:32.109
STREET AT THAT POINT. SO THAT

02:42:32.175 --> 02:42:33.243
THE- BEEN I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:42:33.310 --> 02:42:35.145
OF A- LOT OF POTENTIAL IN MAY

02:42:35.212 --> 02:42:36.146
BE DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL

02:42:36.213 --> 02:42:37.280
BOARDING CARE TYPE FACILITIES

WRITERS. BUT WE TO DO ANY OF

02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:43.220
THAT STUFF WE GOT A REALLY WORK

02:42:43.286 --> 02:42:46.356
NOW. ON THAT AND I THINK THAT
