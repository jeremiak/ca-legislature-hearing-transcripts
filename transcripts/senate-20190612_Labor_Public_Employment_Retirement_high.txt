PLEASE PROCEED WITH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB ONE SEVENTY AS WAS INSPIRED BY THE STORY OF SANDRA PESKY GATHER. AT A HOTEL WORKER WHO BRAVELY CAME FOR TO TELL HER STORY ABOUT BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED ON THE JOB. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT OUR VULNERABLE LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE OFTEN WOMEN AND WOMEN OF OLOR IMMIGRANTS AND WHO ARE MOST IN NEED OF PROTECTION FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. THE TREND WE'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY IN JANITORIAL AND HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES HAS BEEN A TOWARD HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARD OUTSOURCING WORK TO STAFFING AGENCIES. THESE WORKERS MAY GO TO WORK EACH DAY AT THE SAME LOCATION WEARING THE UNIFORM OF THE OFFICE OR HOTEL THAT THEY ARE CLEANING AND REPORTING TO MANAGERS ON SITE. HOWEVER THESE CONTRACTING COMPANIES AND HOTELS ARE NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE ONE SEXUAL WRAPPED. HARASSMENT HAPPENS ON THEIR WATCH TO THEIR WORKERS WHAT HAS RESULTED FROM THIS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY OUR HORSE. USES IN THE WORKPLACE PERPETRATED PERPETRATED BY THE SAME ACTORS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH NO RECOURSE FOR THE WORKER. AB ONE SEVENTY WOULD ENSURE THAT THE CONTRACTED WORKERS CAN SEEK RECOURSE FROM BOTH THEIR DIRECT EMPLOYER THEIR CONTRACTING EMPLOYER IF THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY FORM OF HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS BILL IS TO REQUIRE EMPLOYERS ONCE THEY HAVE LEARNED OF THE HARASSMENT TO TAKE IMMEDIATE AND APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION TO STOP THE HARASSMENT PREVENT FURTHER HARM. BY REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO SHARE CIVIL LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CIVIL LIABILITY WORKERS WILL BE MORE EMPOWERED TO HOLD THEIR WORKPLACES ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE THEIR COMPLAINTS TAKEN SERIOUSLY. I HAVE WITH ME. I THANK YOU GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS I HAVE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT 'M CO PRESIDENT OF UNITE HERE LOCAL LEVIN. WE REPRESENT THIRTY ONE THOUSAND HOTEL. RESTAURANT AND FOOD SERVICE WORKERS IN LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTIES AND ALSO IN ARIZONA. I'M ALSO CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF ORANGE COUNTY WELL FORMALLY HOUSE ENDORSED AB. ONE SEVENTY UNITE HERE LOCAL LEVIN IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE SPONSORED OFFERS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE PASSAGE OF ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY SANDERS LAW. I SPEAK TO YOU AS A FORMER HOTEL WORKER AND SOMEONE WHO'S HEARD TOO MANY STEPS. FROM WORKERS IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. TAKE THE CASE OF SANDRA IS GATHER A FORMER DISHWASHER AT THE RITZ SEAT TERROR NAY A RESORT IN RANCHO PALOS VERDES CALIFORNIA. LIKE MANY DISHWASHERS IN OUT THE TERROR INDIA SANDRA WAS EMPLOYED THROUGH A TEMPORARY AGENCY SHORTLY AFTER SHE BEGAN WORKING SANDRA'S MALE SUPERVISOR ALLEGEDLY BEGAN TO SEXUALLY HARASSED HER. SHE ALLEGE THAT WHEN SHE REBUFFED HIS SEXUAL ADVANCES THE SUPERVISOR RETALIATED AGAINST HER. CHANGING HER SCHEDULE AND CUTTING HER HOURS AFTER SHE CAME FORWARD TO REPORT THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SHE WAS FIRED. EVEN THOUGH SANDRA WORK EACH DAY AT THE TERROR NAY AYE WASHING THE RESORTS DISHES ALONG SIDE RESORT. PEOPLE WORKING FOR AND MANAGEMENT WORKING FOR THE TERROR AND ASK THEY DENIED RESPONSIBILITY IN PART BE BECAUSE SHE AND THE SUPERVISOR WHAT LOGICALLY HARASSED HER OR EMPLOYED THROUGH THE AGENCY. I MAGAZINE RECOGNIZE SANDRA'S COURAGE IN SPEAKING OUT BY INCLUDING HER AMONGST THE SILENCE BREAKER WHO NAMED WHO WERE NAME TIME PERSON OF THE YEAR AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ABLE TO WHEN A SETTLEMENT WITH THE STAFFING. IN APRIL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN YET THE TERROR NAY A CONTINUE TO DENIED RESPONSIBILITY. ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LA TIMES QUOTED TERNI AS PRESIDENT TERRY HACK BY SAYING THAT HER ALLEGATION HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TYRANNY. AB ONE SEVENTY WILL UT AN END TO THE ARGUMENT THAT COMPANIES LIKE TO TEAR ENACT. USED TO DENY RESPONSIBILITY WHEN SUB CONTRACT EMPLOYEES ARE ALLEGEDLY HARASSED AT WORK. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW COMPANIES MUST ALREADY SURE THE CIVIL LIABILITY WHEN THEY'RE LABOR TRACTORS FAIL TO PAY WORKERS. AND YOU KNOW TAKE CARE AND PROVIDE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. AB ONE SEVENTY WILL EXTEND THE SAME SOUND PRINCIPLES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AB ONE SEVENTY WILL ONLY APPLY TO BUSINESSES THAT HAVE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES AND HIRE MORE. THAN FIVE SUBCONTRACTED WORKERS TO PERFORM LABOR WITHIN THEIR USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THIS ISN'T ABOUT HIRING A COUPLE OF PLUMBERS OR ELECTRICIANS TO FIX UP WHAT PROBLEM IN A SMALL BUSINESS. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE A LARGE COMPANIES CANNOT USER LABOR CONTRACT TO SKIRT RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING A WORK ENVIRONMENT FREE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. I URGE YOU TO STAND WITH WORKERS LIKE SANDRA AND SUPPORT AB. ONE SEVENTY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT -- MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO AND THANK YOU.

SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS UNITE HERE AND THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS PORT. THANK YOU. WEBER A BATH OF CALIFORNIA ASKS ME IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEE NO -- ONE IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. THIS IS A REMINDER. FIVE MINUTES THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS UP AND HAVING COME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. WE WOMEN ARE CONCERNED WITH AUTOMATIC IMPOSITION OF JOINT LIABILITY IN ALL SITUATIONS INVOLVING THESE TYPE OF CLAIMS. I THINK WE GET ALL THE VISION CASES WHERE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE JOINT SHARED LIABILITY DEPENDING ON THE SEARCH. THE CASE WHERE THERE'S REQUISITE DIRECTION AND CONTROL. BY THE CLIENT EMPLOYER BUT WE CAN ALSO ENVISIONED CASES WHERE. THE KIND OF PLAYER HAS NO DIRECTION OR CONTROL OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION AND IN OUR OPINION THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE JOINT LIABILITY AUTOMATICALLY IN THAT SITUATION -- SO FOR THAT REASON WERE WERE OPPOSED TO THE THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE JOINT LIABILITY. WE ALSO THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE JOINT LIABILITY THAT WAS ENACTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND LABOR CODE SECTION TWENTY TEN POINT. THREE WHICH EXTENDS JOINT LIABILITY FOR WAGES AND FAILURE PROVIDE WORKERS COMPENSATION AND WE CAN THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS FOR ANY TYPE OF HARASSMENT CLAIM. OFFER WAGES AND WORKERS COMP DESERT. RELATIVELY OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE. MATTERS TO CHECK THAT YOU CAN REVIEW PAYROLL RECORDS OF A CONTRACTOR YOU CAN YOU HEAR AUDIT. YOU CAN CHECK WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERED WITH A PHONE CALL OR CHECKING ON A WEB. AND THE MANTRA OF AB AT NINETY pDO A GOOD JOB VETTING YOUR CONTRACTORS. AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THE SAME. ABILITY TO DO SO NECESSARILY EXIST WITH. UNLESS THERE'S SOME PUBLIC RECORD OF PREVIOUS CLAIMS. THERE'S NOT THAT THE SAME METHODOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO PROPERLY THAT. CONTRACTORS FOR THESE TYPE OF CLAIM SO WE THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO EXTEND. LIABILITY WE THINK THE CURRENT APPROACH WAS THAT CASE BY CASE DETERMINATION WHERE THE KING. CASE I LOOKS AT THE FACTS INTERMENTS THE LEVEL OF CONTROL THAT WAS INVOLVED STRIKES THE PROPER BALANCE. AND SO WE THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO AUTOMATICALLY IMPOSED A LOT JOINT LIABILITY N. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. CAN STONE ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION THE CONTRACTING EMPLOYER DOESN'T HAVE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER THE EMPLOYEES OF THE CONTRACTOR. NOR DO THEY HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRAINING THOSE PEOPLE AND ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO IMPOSE LIABILITY ON THEM FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTIVELY OPPOSED. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KATIE HAVE SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION PROPOSED THANK YOU. HEY SEAN THOSE NATIONAL FEDERATION IN A BEEN A BUSINESS OR BRING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO POSE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THE FORGES ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY.

TECHNICAL WORK ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT ACTUALLY I WENT I WANT TO THANK -- IN FACT YOUR STAFF FOR POINTING OUT WHAT WHEN WE TRANSFERRED OVER -- DEFINITIONS OF THEY WERE INCOMPLETE THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT OBVIOUSLY WE'LL TAKE THOSE MOMENTS IS VERY MUCH. IN THE NO I APPRECIATED I THINK THIS IS A WE NEED TO DO ALL WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES. BUT THERE BE THE DIRECT HIRE CONTRACT AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE LEGISLATION FORWARD I TO CLOSE I JUST RESPECT LAST WHEN I VOTE WHEN I GUESS YOU OVER TIME YET WE WILL HOLD. WELL THAT BILL UNTIL WE DO ESTABLISH A QUORUM SO THANK YOU. VERY MUCH TO MOVE NOW TO ITEM NUMBER. SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE FORTY SEVEN THAT WORKS YEAH. I AM BRINGING FIVE FORTY SEVEN BACK MISTER CHAIR ON A PASS THIS HOUSE LAST YEAR -- IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DID NOT THINK IT WAS READY TO BE SIGNED I I THINK WE'RE IN A BETTER POSITION THIS YEAR -- JANITORIAL WORKERS ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS IN OUR SOCIETY AS WE'VE HEARD BEFORE -- IT'S INCREASINGLY A FEMALE WORKFORCE OFTEN IMMIGRANTS WHO WORK ALONE AND IT MIGHT IN THE ISOLATION FROM CO WORKERS AND PUBLIC REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOMEONE INTERVENING. OR SERVING AS A WITNESS TO THE RAMPANT OCCURRENCES O SEXUAL VIOLENCE. THAT HAPPEN IN THE WORKPLACE AND I SAY SEXUAL VIOLENCE WITHOUT -- WITH MEANING AB WHEN WE ORIGINALLY BROUGHT OUR OUR JANITORIAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT RAPE ON THE NIGHT SHIFT WELL I'M A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD ASSUMED ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEEM TO BE YOU KNOW. SOMETIMES BAD JOKES OR THINGS THAT WERE SAID -- MORE TALK ABOUT JANITORS WE WE SEE MORE AND MORE -- INSTANCES OF TRUE SEXUAL ASSAULT -- RAPE AND SO THIS ISN'T. IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF EVENTS RIGHT WOMEN WHO WHO OFTEN WORK ALONE WHO ARE ACING -- SUPERVISORS -- SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES WHO WHO RAPE AND ASSAULT THEM. SO WHAT THE JANITORS I DID IN FOLLOW UP TO THAT BILL IS A SAID THAT'S GREAT THAT YOU CAN HAVE AN ATTORNEY NOW COME TELL US OUR RIGHTS BECAUSE SOME OF THE PROBLEM WAS WE HAVE. A LOT OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS TO COME FORWARD AND SAY. WE DON'T WE HAVE DIFFERENT RIGHTS HERE. WOULD WOULD WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SUBJECT TO THAT SO WE HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK UP. TO DEMAND -- TO NOT BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR RAPED OR HARASSED -- BUT THAT THERE'S A DISCONNECT WHEN YOU BRING IN AN ATTORNEY TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN A LANGUAGE THAT THEY IN A CULTURE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHEN IN FACT WE CAN CREATE EIGHT A NEW MODEL TO ALLOW JANITORS THEMSELVES TO BE TRAINED AS A HAVE ALREADY BEEN ON TO POWER THEMSELVES AND TEACH EACH OTHER -- NOT ONLY HOW TO REPORT AN UNDERSTAND ABUSE BUT ALSO HOW TO DEFEND THEMSELVES -- AND SO IT'S A MODEL PROGRAM THAT I THINK -- ONCE IMPLEMENTED COULD BE EXPANDED IT'S BASED ON KIND OF A PROMO TORA IDEA THAT YOU KNOW THEY OF COURSE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BETTER THEY WILL THEY WILL -- YOU TALK MORE WE WILL POWER WORKERS IN A WAY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BETTER AND IN THIS INDUSTRY. SO WITH THAT I WILL MOVE ON TO MY WITNESSES. THANK YOU JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES BETWEEN THE THREE THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] I HAVE. ONE OF THE YES SIR.

IT IS OFTEN WORK ALONE AT NIGHT JANITORIAL WORKERS FACE A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAKE THEM PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT AND RAPE WHILE ON THE JOB. BEING ISOLATED FROM CO WORKERS IN THE PUBLIC REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING SOMEBODY INTERVENE AS A WITNESS AND ALSO REDUCE. THE TO COME FORWARD TO SOMEBODY YOU TRUST TO REVEAL WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU SEXUAL HARASSMENT ABUSE ASSAULT AND RAPE WE KNOW WHAT CAL COSTS AND WE KNOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PREVENTION CAN WORK.

MY NAME IS CATALINA I AM JANITOR AND I SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. NOW MOVED OPPOSITION PLEASE. GOOD MORNING AGAIN MORNING MR CHEN SENATORS THAT HAVE BECOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- AS A PRELIMINARY MATTER THERE IS LOTS OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE WORK STILL BEING DONE ON THIS PROGRAM RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SPENDING BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. MAKING CHANGES TO THIS SECTION OF THE LAW THERE'S TWO SEPARATE LABOR COMMISSIONER REGULATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PENDING ONE ON JANITORIAL REGISTRATION ONE ON THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING. REQUIREMENTS AND THERE'S ALSO DEPARTMENT FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ANY REGULAR. I ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING WHICH AUTHORIZED PEER TO PEER TRAINING BUT DON'T NECESSARILY MANDATE IT -- BUT OPEN THE DOOR TO THAT CONCEPT AND SO. WE THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW THE DUST TO SETTLE ON THOSE REGULATORY CHANGES BEFORE YOU MOVE FORWARD -- WITH THIS BILL AND WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR VETOED A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR AND SAID WE SHOULD ALLOW IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM BEFORE ENGAGING. AND ACTING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL ITSELF WE HAVE TWO CONCENS NUMBER ONE OF THE PROVISION THAT REQUIRES APPLET. SUBMIT INFORMATION RELATED TO A BRANCH LOCATIONS AND SUBCONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF THOSE SUBCONTRACTORS. WE THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR AN APPLICANT NECESSARILY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION AS TO THE EMPLOYEES SO WE THINK THE PERIOD SHOULD AND IN THAT SENSE WHERE YOU PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BRANCH LOCATIONS IN THE SUB CONTRACT. BUT NOT NECESSARY CERTAINLY DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF EMPLOYEES -- THIS CONCEPT IS CONTAINED IN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S REGULATIONS AS WELL AND WE RATE BASED CONCERNS WITHOUT PROPOSAL NOT PROCESS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PEER TO PEER TRAINING MANDATE. THIS BILL MANDATES YOU ONLY USE A PROVIDER THAT'S ON A STATE APPROVEDLIST AND YOU PROP PROVIDE THEM TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE. TO DO TO DO THE TRAINING AND WE THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE. WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME I ASKED. INTO UNION ORGANIZING AND WE THINK IT'S JUST AN APPROPRIATE TO DO IT THROUGH THIS CHANNEL WHERE YOU HAVE TO PAY THESE INDIVIDUALS TO TIME STATE MINIMUM WAGE FROM A SPECIALIST THAT'S ONLY APPROVED BY THE STATE. I THINK AUTHORS RAISED LEGITIMATE ISSUES RELATED TO CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN LANGUAGE ISSUES FOR THIS UNIQUE. GROUP OF WORKERS AND WE THINK THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE ISSUES AND WE THINK A CONVERSATION WE HAD ABOUT WAYS TO BUILD. THOSE. CONTAINS THOSE COMPONENTS WITHOUT MANDATING THAT COME FROM A SPECIALIST OF ONLY STATE APPROVED. PROVIDERS AND SO WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE SPONSOR ABOUT -- ENGAGING IN CONVERSATIONS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES WITHOUT DOING IT TO A SPECIFIC MANDATED LIST. I WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT AT THIS TIME WERE POSTED. FOR YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SHE HELLO ANSWER THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION RIPOSTE THANK YOU. LOGIN SHAUN THOSE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF IN A BUSINESS FOR BRING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO PUT THANK YOU MISTER LEWIS OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEN KNOWN BRING IT ACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS. BUT WE DO HAVE A MOTION IN THE I JUST WANTED. SENATOR ME. ALRIGHT. IT'S ALRIGHT YOU WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM IT'S ALWAYS ALLOWED ENTRANCE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. OF I JUST WANTED. TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THAT I MEAN IT'S A GREAT GREAT BILL AND A GREAT IDEA AND CERTAINLY IT. JANITORIAL STAFF FOR THEIR UNIQUELY VULNERABLE. OF TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THE TESTIMONY WAS AS PAINFUL TO HEAR. WHEN YOU THINK OF PEOPLE PLACED IN THOSE SITUATIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITH NO CONTROL AND AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND EXPECTING SOMETHING? I THINK THE THE OPPONENTS TO MAKE. I THINK A VALID POINT IN SOME SENSE THAT THIS COULD FORCE THE JANITORIALPOLICE. TO TWO PLAYERS TO PAY FOR THE UNION ORGANIZATION IN THE GUISE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING AND I KNOW YOU'VE YOU'VE HEARD THAT ARGUMENT TO BE MADE SO IT -- TO A COULD CREATE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE IN SOME ISSUES WITH THE REGULATIONS AND OF SO I JUST. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT DEFINITION WIDENED SOMEHOW SO I MEAN I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE THE THE BILL SO THAT WE CAN. PROTECT THOSE WERE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE KEYS BUT I HOPE THE YOU CAN SEE SOME DEFINITIONAL CHAGES IN FROM BROADENING OF THAT. AND AND I TRULY SUPPORTED TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WILL ON THE FLOOR AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT. DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND IN YEAH YOU MAY CLOSE IT I I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR -- FIRST OF ALL AS FAR AS TIMING. YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT TRUSTING THE WORKERS THE WORKERS CAME UP WITH THE MOST OF IT WAY TO TEACH SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN DEFENSE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. TO EACH OTHER I'M AND IN SO WHERE DO WE ACTUALLY GET I'M THE BEST ADVICE FROM WORKERS STATE THEY HAVE. BEEN TRAINED THEY'RE NOT -- THAT BY ALL MEANS THEIR UNION ACTIVISTS RIGHT NOW THE TRAINING IT ARE UNION MEMBERS BUT THEY'RE NOT UNION STAFF THIS ISN'T UNION STAFF GOING AN ENTRY IT'S ACTUAL JANITORS SO. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THAT YOU KNOW IF IF NON UNION JANITORS -- HAD THE ABILITY AND AND I'M SURE THAT THE UNION WOULD ALSO TRAIN THEM AND AND PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF OF EMPOWERMENT TO NON UNION JANITORS WHO BY THE WAY THOUGH ARE AT WILL EMPLOYEES AND AND DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK UP IN THE WORKPLACE SO WE CAN HAVE. A DISCONNECT THERE -- IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EMPOWERING WORKERS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER -- YOU ALMOST HAVE TO BE UNION -- TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PROTECTION IN THAT WORK SO I I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC. THE MOST OFFENSIVE THING THAT THEY CONTINUE BRING UP IS IS THE FACT THAT YOU'D HAVE TO TEACH THESE TRAIN OUR PAY THESE PRINTERS TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE IN FACT IN OTHER COMMITTEES I HEARD. IT SHOULD BE DOING IT VOLUNTARILY. I WOULD CHALLENGE THEM TO FIND AN ATTORNEY WHO TEACHES -- SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE COST AS AS VALUED AS TREISMAN WAGE YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A TURNS OUT THERE WHO COME IN AND TEACH THAT COURSE FOR TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE I'D BE SHOCKED. PROBABLY WOULD HIRE THEM -- AND AND LITERALLY TO IT TO SUGGEST THAT THESE JANITORS DON'T DESERVE COMPENSATION FOR THIS WORK IT IS ALWAYS A LITTLE OFFENSIVE. WE'RE ALSO IN A VERY IMPORTANT TIME PERIOD IN THAT -- THESE REGULATIONS ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND IF WE HAVE A MODEL THAT WE CAN USE THAT IS WE WE BELIEVE THE BEST MODEL IT'S TIME TO INTERVENE RATHER THAN LET ANOTHER MODEL BE STEP FORWARD. AND HAVE TO COME IN THE SAME ARGUMENTS WILL OF COURSE BE MADE WE JUST DECIDED ON THIS MODEL LET'S GIVE IT WHAT A YEAR TWO YEARS FIVE YEARS HOW MANY WOMEN. IN THAT PROCESS AND HAVE TO CONTINUE TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO ASSAULT AND RAPE WHILE WE LET THE DUST SETTLE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I HEARD LET THE DUST SETTLE. I DON'T WANT THE DUST TO SETTLE I WANT THESE WOMEN TO IT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SO I THINK THE TIME IS NOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK I'M. WEAK ENOUGH FOR ME WHEN THEY BROUGHT ME THIS BILL IF IT. SOMETHING LIKE THIS THIS IS PROBABLY HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH WORK IN WORKERS IN TRAINING MORE SO. NOT THAT WE SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF WORKERS EMPOWERING THEMSELVES IN BEING FROM A TODAS AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND ACTUALLY TEACHING THEM THE BEST WAY THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO LEARN. SO I THINK IT'S A MODEL PROGRAM AND I I HOPE I'M GLAD YOU'LL BE SPORTING AT MY HOPE IT CONTINUES TO MOVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMMENTS WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SENATOR PAN THANK YOU FOR THAT THE OF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR HILL HI BILL AYE MORRELL [inaudible] JACKSON. MITCHELL AYE MITCHELL AYE PAN ALL RIGHT. I WILL HAVE THREE THREE VOTES WILL HOLD WILL OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS. REMEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB. FIVE EIGHTY NINE AS WE CONTINUE ON MISTER CHAIR OF AMONG MY BILLS THAT. MADE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS LAST YEAR ABOUT BE TOWED BY OUR FORMER GOVERNOR. I BRING YOU AB -- FIVE EIGHTY NINE IT IS SPONSORED BY -- I MUST SAY MY REPUBLIC CAN -- DISTRICT. SAN DIEGO. IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN WE KNOW THAT WHILE TWENTY SIXTEEN SANDIA BASE COUPLE WAS ARRESTED FOR INSULATING AN INDONESIAN DOMESTIC WORKER IN THEIR HOME FORCING HER TO WORK BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY WITH NO PAY AND NO DAYS OFF. THE WAY -- EMPLOYERS ABUSE SO OFTEN -- IMMIGRANTS IS THROUGH SOMETHING WE CALL DOCUMENT SERVITUDE THAT'S WHERE THEY WITHHOLD THEIR DOCUMENTS WHICH ALLOW THEM TO MOVE FREELY IN THE UNITED STATES -- WITHOUT REPUTATION AND AND DON'T PROVIDE THEM WITH THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO KNOW THAT EVEN IF THEY'RE HERE ON A VISA OR IF THEY HVE A PASSPORT OR IF THEY HAVE A GREEN CARD THAT THEY THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SOME PROTECTED RIGHTS. THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL THAT WOULD -- SIMPLY -- INSURE THAT WORKERS ARE ARE MADE AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THAT -- THAT THAT THE EMPLOYER MUST PROVIDE A WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION TO THOSE VERY BASIC RIGHTS THAT -- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OF COURSE BEING PAID THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FORCED TO LIVE SOMEWHERE -- AND THAT YOU YOU HAVE BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS THAT EXIST EVEN IF YOU'RE BROUGHT HERE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY TO DO -- SIR. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. VERY GOOD IT'S AMAZING HOW. ONE WOULD NOT THINK THE BILL WOULD PLEASE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WANT TO RUN HEALTH SEES ME COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M SAN DIEGO DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY MARY ELLIN BARRETT. THEN THE TEAM LEADER OF THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AREA OF OUR OFFICE AND HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS. IN MY TIME PROSECUTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES I'VE SEEN AS CRIME IT HAPPENS IN THE SHADOWS I'VE SEEN. THE TRAFFICKERS WITHHOLD DOCUMENTS. ALLOWING THE VISAS THEREAFTER TO EXPIRE AND THEN HOLDING THAT. LACK OF AUTHORIZATION OVER THE HEAD. OF THE VICTIM I HAVE. HANDLED CASES WHERE THAT LINE OF DEMARCATION IS WHEN THE X. AT REAL HORRIBLE EXPLOITATION BEGETS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE THEM. I FOUND OFTEN THAT ARE ARE VICTIMS DO NOT KNOW -- OUR SYSTEM OF LAWS OUR LAWS -- HOW ARE LAWS ARE ENFORCED HOW ARE POLICE WORK WHAT THE WORKERS RIGHTS ARE OR EVEN THAT THERE WERE? FORTY WHEN THEY'RE FOREIGNERS IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY'RE OFTEN MANIPULATED BY THE TRAFFICKER WHO EXPLAINS OUR SYSTEM TO HIS OR HER ADVANTAGE. FOR EXAMPLE. I'LL TAKE YOUR DOCUMENTS AND KEEP THEM SAFE. AND YOU CANNOT GO OUTSIDE WITHOUT YOUR DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THEM AT ALL TIMES. WELL THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE. COUNTRY BUT BUT THE WORKERS DON'T KNOW THAT. THAT IS ANOTHER WAY TO BOTH CONTROL AND ISOLATE THE VICTIMS IF THEY THINK THEY CAN'T GO OUT. WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT BECAUSE THE THE NATIONAL STUDY TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ENTER THE COUNTRY. AUTHORIZED AND BY THE TIME THE VICTIMIZATION DISCOVERED 69% OF THEM. IT THE ARE ON AUTHORIZED. SO IT'S GOING ON LANGUAGE IS A RED FLAG IN VICTIMIZATION OF THIS. THE INABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH INCREASES THE CHANCES OF VICTIMIZATION THIS BILL. EXPLAINS THE RIGHTS IN THE NATIVE LANGUAGE OF THE WORKER WHICH WILL HELP EDUCATE AND PROTECT THEM GOING FORWARD. THIS BILL WILL SHINE A LIGHT FOR ALL WORKERS ON THE LIES THAT THE TRAFFICKERS USED TO CONTROL AND MANIPULATE THEIR VICTIMS. PROVIDE A TOOL TO EDUCATE THE WORKERS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST THE FEW UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS WHO WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. AS WELL AS A TOOL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HOLD THOSE OF EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE AND STOP THIS CRIME TO STOP IT AT THE BEGINNING. STAGES BEFORE IT MOVES IN TO THE FULL BLOWN LABOR. TAKING AND THE DEVASTATION THAT THAT CALLED SINCE.

I THINK -- SCAR ON NOT JUST OUR CURRENT -- LABOR PRACTICES BUT ON OUR HISTORY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT IT WARRANTS -- WORKERS TO UNDERSTAND THE RIGHT IN THEIR LANGUAGE OF CHOICE. IT WARRANTS -- A VERY SMALL BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS TO TO MAINTAIN DOCUMENTS SO THAT -- SO THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN ACTUALLY GO IN AND ASK FOR THOSE DOCUMENTS AND THAT IT CAN. IT CAN BE THE GATEWAY INTO APPROVING ON THE THIRD DOCUMENT SERVITUDE OR THE WORKERS WERE BEING HELD -- WITHOUT WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT IN A SITUATION SO -- YOU KNOW THIS WAS BROUGHT TO US BY I THINK THE DA WHO IS VERY INTERESTED IN PROSECUTING THIS CASE IS AND I WHICH WOULD HAVE MORE DAYS WHO WERE THAT'S INTERESTED. I'M BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COME IN -- THEY LARGELY COME IN ON BIG CASES WITH I AM LARGE EMPLOYERS A SELDOM COMMAND ON ON THE INDIVIDUAL -- SMALL SMALLER CASES THAT WE FIND THIS TYPE OF ABUSE IN AS WELL SO RESPECT LAST NIGHT. THANK YOU AND IN A MY UNDERSTANDING IS OF ISSUE THIS IS NOT JUST SPECIFIC TO SAN DIEGO OR THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PORTS OF ENTRY IN CALIFORNIA.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER WELCOME. I THINK HIS IS A PRETTY FAST EASY BILL. THEY'RE ALL EASY AREN'T THEY YES THEY ALSO I HOWEVER THREE AB THREE FORTY SIX PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FORTY SIX CORRECTS AND EQUITY IN EXISTING LAW WERE LAUSD SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS. RECEIVE A WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION. FORTY FIFTY ANOTHER SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS DO NOT. COME REFER TO AS FORTY FIFTY TIME IS TEMPERATE. AND IF IT PROVIDES POLICE OFFICERS WITH UP TO A YEAR PAID LEAVE DEFENDER IN LINE OF DUTY. TWENTY FIFTEEN FIVE POINT 2% OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THREATEN OUR WITH A WEAPON OR STUFF ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. PLEASE AUTHORS MUST RESTORE LIFE TO PROTECT STUDENTS AND STAFF. TO PROVIDE OF THE SAME BENEFITS IF INJURED ON THE JOB. MATH PROTECTION TO LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS WERE INJURED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. WE'RE GOOD WE HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THREE FIFTY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CENTER PERERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER SAID AB THREE FORTY SIX CORRECTION INEQUITY IN CURRENT LAW WERE LA UNIFIED SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS ARE THE ONLY SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS. INCLUDED IN LABOR CODE SECTION. FORTY EIGHT FIFTY ARE ALL JUST ADD THAT THIS ISSUE CAN HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ROCESS DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND THEY DESERVE EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW. SO FOR EXAMPLE KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT USED TO PROVIDE FORTY EIGHT FIFTY TIME TO IT SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS UNTIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON THE DISTRICT OF THE BENEFIT AWAY. DISTRICT JUSTIFY THIS ACTION BY POINTING TO THE EXACT IN EQUITY AND LEAVE. SIX TO REMEDY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS SAN DIEGO UNIFIED. US DIEGO UNIFIED PROVIDES ITS OFFICERS WITH FORTY EIGHT FIFTY TIME NOT AS A RESULT OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. BUT BECAUSE OF A WORKERS COMP APPEALS BOARD DECISION THAT FOUND A SCHOOL POLICE OFFICER WAS ENTITLED TO FORTY EIGHT FIFTY TIME. SO BY ADDING ALL SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS TO LADY LABOR CODE. FORTY EIGHT FIFTY AB THREE FORTY SIX WILL ENSURE THAT ALL SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS RECEIVE THIS VALUABLE BENEFIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JEFFREY LEE **** ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS BENEFIT ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THOSE IN OPPOSITION CASE OF GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STATE FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES AND ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT SEA SAKE I A HERE TODAY AND VERY RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION AT THE BE. THREE FORTY SIX I'D LIKE TO START BY SHARING OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE AUTHORS -- OFFICE THE SPONSOR IN THE GENEROUS WITH THEIR TIME HEARING OUR CONCERNS. AB THREE FORTY SIX PROPOSES EXPANDING THE CLASS THE PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS ELIGIBLE FOR LABOR CODE. FORTY EIGHT FIFTY BENEFITS THAT INCLUDES FULL SALARY CONTINUATION FOR ONE FULL YEAR FREE OF STATE AND FEDERAL TAXES FOR EACH INJURY THEY OCCUR IN THE LINE OF DUTY. FORTY EIGHT EIGHT FIFTY BENEFITS ARE IN LIEU OF TD BENEFITS CURRENTLY PROVIDED TO THESE INJURED WORKERS. THE GOAL OF THE TV BENEFIT IS TO APPROXIMATE THE IN PLACE TAKE HOME PAY DURING THE PERIOD AFTER INJURY WHEN THE EMPLOYEE IS TEMPORARILY UNABLE TO WORK. THE GOAL IS IMPLEMENTED BY BASING THE WEEKLY TV BENEFIT ON TWO THIRDS OF THE EMPLOYEES AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGES BUT BECAUSE THE BENEFIT IS ALSO TAX FREE MOST EMPLOYEES RECEIVE A SUFFICIENT TV BENEFIT THAT'S CLOSE TO THEIR TAKE HOME PAY WHILE THEY'RE RECOVERING. OUR GOAL IS PUBLIC EMPLOYERS IS TO HELP OUR INJURED WORKERS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE BASED MEDICAL CARE FOR THEIR ILLNESSES AND INJURIES AND THEN TO HELP THEM RETURN TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. FORTY EIGHT FIFTY CREATES A DISINCENTIVE OF RETURNING TO WORK EVEN IF THEY'RE ABLE DUE TO THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE OF MAKING NORMAL TAKE HOME PAY PLUS WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID IN TAXES. AND WHILE ABUSIVE FORTY EIGHT FIFTY MAY NOT BE INTENTIONAL IT IS A REALITY. UNDER THIS BILL PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ALSO FACE HIGHER OVERTIME COSTS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FILL THE POSITION OF AN OFFICER. FORTY EIGHT FIFTY TIME BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO COVER THOSE CHEFS THIS IS AT GREAT EXPENSE NOT JUST TO THE EMPLOYER BUT TO THE REMAINING STAFF WHO MUST WORK LONG HOURS TO COMPENSATE LOSS OF THE MISSING OFFICER. GOOD JOB IT IS NOT LEAVE THAT THE NECESSARY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO JUSTIFY ALL SCHOOL POLICE OFFICERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR TIME ON THE JOB OR THEIR ACTUAL DUTIES PERFORMED A RECEIVING THE SAME GENEROUS BENEFIT IS ACTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT. LOCAL AGENCIES TYPICALLY FIND WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS OUT OF THEIR GENERAL FUND THROUGH NONPROFIT PUBLIC ENTITY GPAS AND EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON SPECIAL ENHANCE BENEFITS MUST COME FROM SOMEWHERE. AND FUNDING FOR THE SPECIAL BENEFITS PROPOSING AB THREE FORTY SIX WILL COME OUT OF EDUCATION BUDGETS AND WILL SUBTRACT FROM CLASSROOMS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO FULLY EXAMINE BOTH THE JUSTIFICATION AND THE COST OF THIS PROPOSAL. BUT AT THIS TIME WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. ELIZABETH ASKED ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED ONE THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION JEAN AND BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR RECESSION YES SENATOR I'LL MOVE THE BILL IN THE SUPPORTING THE PARTICULARS OF THAT IMPACTS LA U. S. THE THAT I REPRESENT -- DO HAVE A CONCERN IN THIS IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE. REYES HERE BUT IN FISCAL COMMITTEE -- SINCE PROPER E. FAILED IN LOS ANGELES. THE ISSUE IS HOW WILL BE PAID. FOR TEACHERS STRIKING BILL UST IS VERY PUBLICLY BEEN IN VERY DIRE FINANCIAL -- STRAIGHT. AGAIN WITH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE -- ANGELENOS DIDN'T SUPPORT IT WILL BE A CONCERN IN TERMS OF HOW THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS DAYS OF WELL I THINK IT. IS A RELEVANT ISSUE TO RAISE JUST IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY -- BUT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT ON THE ON THE STRENGTH OF THE POLICY TODAY SOME OF THE BILL. WE THANK YOU AN INSIDE A TO SIT LIKE THE I JUST TO SUPPORT THE POLICY IDEAS. BASICALLY THESE ARE SWORN PEACE OFFICERS AND THEY SHOULD RECEIVE THIS. WHICH IS OTHER TOWARD HIS OFFICERS AND COULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF THAT HAPPY BUT CERTAINLY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS WELL. OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SURE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WHENEVER WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR.

I TO REVIVE AB FOR FIFTY SAID I'M SORRY ITEM NUMBER FOUR OF FOUR EIGHTY THREE FIFTY FIVE PLEASE PROCEED THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE CURRENTLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD THE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD. PUBLIC AGENCIES NOT COVERED BY PER LABOR DISPUTES ARE OFTEN CONTEST IN THE COURT ROOM WHICH CAN BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING. I CONTRAST CURBS EXPERTISE IN LABOR RELATIONS LAW OFFERS EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AN EXPEDITIOUS AND COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE. TO JUDY. PLACE DISPUTES THIS BILL SIMPLY ADDS THE ORANGE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. TO THAT VAST MAJORITY OF AGENCIES ALREADY COVERED UNDER PER THE VAST MAJORITY OF PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES. WITH ME TODAY SHANE GOODMAN REPRESENTING THE TEAMSTERS UNION THERE IS SPONSORING. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS -- WE DO -- STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL -- IT ARE WE HAVE I THINK PROXIMALLY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AT C. T. -- AND THE UNION. FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE MOVE -- SO THAT WE CAN SAVE COST IF A DISPUTE SHOULD ARISE -- I WANT SAID THAT THERE'S A TON ADDITION. THE EMPLOYER -- BUT WHEN THEY'RE THERE IS A DISPUTE ON UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE AND YOU DO HAVE TO GO TO COURT IT CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR BOTH SIDES AND I THINK THAT'S WHY -- CT A IS IS IS NOT OPPOSING THE BILL BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR THE EMPLOYER. TO AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTED OUT PER PASS. JURISDICTION AND THE EXPERTISE TO HANDLE THESE KINDS OF CASES AND LASTLY I WOULD NOTE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS PER BASSETT HAD INCREASED FUNDING -- SO THAT THEY CAN HANDLE -- SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY'VE HAD IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF BACKLOG I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE ANYMORE AND THINK ADDING ONE AGENCY.

SORRY TO MUSCLE IN ON YOU HERE AT SCHEDULE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR -- SENATORS ROBERT MAJI FOR THE CAL COMMERCENTRE SORRY O TURN MY BACK KEY PRESIDENTIAL. IT'S ALWAYS EMBARRASSING -- SO. WE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED US THIS BILL AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND PAGE -- FOR SPRING A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO US ABOUT THIS AND WORKING OUR CORE CONCERN HERE IS NOT -- YOU KNOW PREVENTING LED REGULATIONS COMING UP PIPER STOPPING THEM -- YOU KNOW THESE REGULATIONS ARE A LONG TIME COMING AND I'M IN A MOMENT I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE ALL UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE THERE'S SOME ISSUES WITH ACCELERATING ALWAYS. BUT JUST THAT WE ENSURE THERE IS ENOUGH TIME FOR THE STANDARDS BOARD WHICH IS IT DISTINCT PORTION RIGHT IT AND CAL OSHA WAS NOT HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS THE SAME WAY. AS THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE TIME TO LOOK AT IT MAKE ANY AMENDMENTS THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AND THE TIME. FOR INTEREST GROUPS TO SPEAK AT THAT POINT. SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN -- TWO EIGHT YOU MAY EXPLAIN THE DISTINCTION RIGHT WE AGREE THAT THE EIGHT YEAR DELAY HERE AT IS CONSIDERABLE IN FACT THE ENTIRE TO LIVE. THESE LEAD REGULATIONS BEEN PLACE FIFTY OR SO YEARS OUT OF DATE WHICH ITSELF IS PROBLEMATIC -- BUT AS THE LATE IN THIS PROCESS READ THE DIVISION TOOK I BELIEVE AROUND SIX YEARS I RECALL CORRECTLY TO COME OUT WITH THE PROPOSED STANDARDS. AND THEN THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THE SERIE A WHICH IS DONE AFTER. AND IT'S COME OUT. I WAS ALSO MUCH LONGER INCOMING THAT ANYBODY $TED CAME OUT OF BELIEVE TWO THREE WEEKS AGO AROUND THERE. OKAY WAS A COMMENT I WOULD. OKAY I WAS ONLY HIGHLY BUT ARRIVING PUBLIC RELEASED AT THAT POINT BUT RECENTLY TO THE THE POINT IS THAT THIS PROCESS HASN'T GONE TO THE STANDARDS BOARD AND THE STANDARDS WHAT HASN'T BEEN THE BODY DELAYING THE DIVISION AND ANY KIND OF CONTRACT TO PREP THE SERIE A HAVE BEEN. DELAYED AND WE WE AGREE THAT'S REGRETTABLE WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE THE STANDARD POOR'S PROCESS WHICH IS SEPARATE SHOULD BE RUSHED FOR THAT REASON. AND AS TO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE REGULATIONS IF YOU IF YOU'D LIKE I'VE I'VE READ IN SOME DETAIL THE PRETTY LENGTHY I'M I'M GLAD TO TRY TO BE HELPFUL. THE DETAILS OF EVERITT ISSUE BUT THAT'S YES OF I AGREE IT'S AN ISSUE OF TIMING -- AND AS TO THE EXTENT OF THE CHANGE JUST TO RESPOND BRIEFLY TO ONE OF THE COMMENTS MADE. THE EXTENDED CHANGES REGULATIONS IS CONSIDERABLE WE'RE TALKING THAT 80% REDUCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF PRESS PRESS OF A LEAD AS WELL AS SOME SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO THE MECHANICS.

YOUR OTHER HEELS A LAND THEY GOING TO DO IT IN TIME THERE MAY BE OTHER CALLING TODAY THEY WON'T BUT WHAT WE'RE TELLING THEM IS. IT'S TIME RIGHT AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL GIVE IT MORE PRIORITY. IN THE PACKAGE THEN THAT'LL BE MY CLOSER GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE CLERK. QUIRK. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM -- SENATOR MITCHELL THIS SHOULD BE -- PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR HILL AYE. AYE MORALE [inaudible] JACKSON. MITCHELL HI I HAS TO VOTE HOLDING FOR THE AFTER MEMBERS THANK YOU TO WORK ON IT SURE KALRA [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. ITEM NUMBER SIX AB [inaudible] FIVE TWENTY WELCOME. HOW DOES THIS COMMITTEE LOOK FOR THE OTHER SIDE? SHE'S LIKE A LETTER. YEAH. BUT VERY MUCH SHARON SENATORS -- PROBLEMS IN AB FIVE TWENTY THIS DEFINES WHEN A PUBLIC SUBSIDY IS DE MINIMUS FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE PREVAILING WAGE APPLIES PRIVATE PROJECTS USING PUBLIC FUNDS. THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT A PUBLIC SUBSIDY ON A PRIVATE PROJECT IS DE MINIMUS SO LONG AS IT IS LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND LESS THAN OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. UNDER CURRENT LAW PROJECT IS NOT SUBJECT THE PREVAILING WAGE Là EVEN IF IT RECEIVES A PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SUBSIDY. IT THAT SUBSIDY IS DE MINIMUS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT. CHOOSE THE TERM DE MINIMUS IS NOT DEFINED IN THE STATUTE THERE IS NO GUIDANCE AS TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL PUBLIC SUBSIDY THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DE MINIMUS. THIS IS LED. THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO MAKE INCONSISTENT RULINGS AS TO WHAT IS DE MINIMUS LEADING TO CONFUSION AND LITIGATION ON WHAT THE TERM ACTUALLY MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED AS DE MINIMUS A ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PUBLIC SUBSIDY TO NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR NOT PROCESSING FACILITY PROJECT. SINCE IT WAS ONLY ONE POINT 75%. OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST BUT THEN WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. OF TAXPAYER MONEY -- CERTAINLY IS SIGNIFICANT. ABOUT A SUBSIDY FOR A PRIVATE PROJECT IS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR A NOTABLE TAXPAYER INVESTMENT AND IT IS REASONABLE. TO REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGES AT THE DEVELOPER WANTS A PUBLIC SUBSIDY OVER THAT AMOUNT. UNDER THIS BILL NO DEVELOPER IS REQUIRED TO TAKE A PUBLIC SUBSIDY OF THE DE MINIMUS AMOUNT IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE. OF HOLDING A PREVAILING WAGE LAWS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ENSURE THAT CONTRACTORS ARE NOT AWARDED PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS BY VIRTUE OF PAYING LOW WAGES. AND UNDERCUTTING A COMPETITORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT AND WILL. TAKE IT OVER TO THE INCOMPARABLE SAYS IDEAS WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING TRADES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PRESSURE THAT I KNOW. OF A LOT OF MEANING [inaudible] THE TRUE. THIS IS YOUR MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AS A BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCILTHE PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION -- WE ARE -- DID COMPLETE AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT THEY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTION ABOUT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY ACHIEVES OR SEEKS TO ACHIEVE. ON THE PREVAILING WAGE STATUTES WERE ENACTED TO ENSURE THAT IT WAS A READILY AND AVAILABLE SKILLED. WORKFORCE FOR THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC PROJECTS THAT WERE AVAILABLE BY THE BY THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE EXPANSION OF THE PREVAILING WAGE AND THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS INCLUDED THE TERM TO MINIMIZE BUT IT WAS NOT A FIGHT. AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS CHOSE 2% AS THE NUMBER A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. BUT AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THOSE NUMBERS ARE COMING IN VERY HIGH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SUBSIDIES TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER. SO IT IS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE PREVAILING WAGE LAW THAT ONLY INSURERS THE WORKERS GET A FAIR AND DECENT HEY. BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE USE OF APPRENTICES OF PROMISES THAT I THINK A LOT OF US YOU HAVE DEBATED HERE LEGISLATION TO TRY TO ATTRACT MORE. WHAT THAT DOES FOR ANY TYPE OF DEVELOP OR CONTRACTOR IS IT PROVIDES THE NEXT GENERATION OF SKILLED WORKERS AND AS YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSIONS OVER THERE BEING A LETTER LABOR SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS TO ACHIEVE NOT ONLY? PUBLIC WORKS IN THE FUTURE BUT ALSO IN THE HOUSING RESIDENTIAL MARKET -- WHICH WE BELIEVE FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS THEY'RE EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE BUT IT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WAGES HAVE NOT KEPT UP. WITH INFLATION AND THE COST OF LIVING AND SO IT MAKES IT LESS ATTRACTIVE FOR WORKERS TO JUST. CHAU ALSO THERE ISN'T AN INHERENT. SYSTEM WITHIN THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET TO ACTUALLY TRAIN WORKERS IN THAT RESPECT WE ARE NOT CHANGING ANY TYPE OF A CURRENT EXEMPTION AS IT EXISTS WITHIN THE LABOR CODE AND THERE'S A LITANY OF EXEMPTIONS FOR RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS IN THE CODE. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THERE SHOULD BE A MONETARY CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SO THAT THE DEVELOPER CAN MAKE A CHOICE WHETHER TO ACCEPT THAT AND THEN TRIGGERED THE PREVAILING WAGE OR TO ACCEPT UP TO THE AMOUNT AND THEN DID? NOT RECEIVE THE REST FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK. GOVERNOR THE MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE LARGEST ARTICLE BUILDERS IN THE STATE WE ARE SIGNATORY TO THE CARPENTERS AND LABORS UNION. WE BUILD MOST OF THE LARGE PUBLIC PROJECTS AND PRIVATE PROJECTS IN THE STATE. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE NEED CERTAINTY IN THE MARKET PLACE YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN -- UNCERTAINTY IN THE PAST IN LITIGATION OVER THE PAST OVER PROJECTS WE'VE COMMENCED WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS IS IT A PUBLIC OR IS IT NOT A PUBLIC. IN THE END WE GO TO COURT AND THAT UNCERTAINTY DOESN'T BENEFIT OUR MEMBERS -- THIS PROVIDES THE CERTAINTY WE NEED TO AVOID THOSE PROBLEMS IT ALSO ADDRESSES MISTER DE HAS RAISED THE SKILLED LABOR SHORTAGE WE NEED. WORKERS IN THE PIPELINE WE ARE HAVING LABOR SHORTAGES PARTICULARLY IN THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET AND OUR MEMBERS BUILD A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF ALL THE LOW INCOME HOUSING MULTI FAMILY IN THE STATE AS WELL. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU TO GOVERNOR OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD.

MORNING MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER SILVIO FOR OUR HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION -- JUST TO START OFF -- WANNA MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE PERCENT THRESHOLD THAT IS IN THE BILL -- WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED VERY SIMILAR BILLS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN HE SAID THAT THE 2% THRESHOLD WAS LONG STANDING PRACTICE AND THEY'RE NOT BEEN ANY INDICATIONS OF PROBLEMS IN BOTH OF THOSE VETO MESSAGES? SO WE ARE NOT OPPOSED 22% OUR CONCERN HAS TO DO WITH THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR TRIGGERING THRESHOLD. IT IS GOING TO MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON EFFORTS TO GET GREEN BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES ENERGY EFFICIENCY TECHNOLOGIES ALL THOSE PUBLIC POLICY GOALS. WITH ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS INTO THE MARKET PLACE. WITH THIS BILL AS IT IS CURRENTLY -- DRAFTED. FOR MORE THAN A DECADE NOW CB I A HAS BEEN REALLY ON THE FOREFRONT AND THE LEADING EDGE OF GOING AFTER GREEN ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES -- IN LARGE PART BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH THE STATE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION TO HAVE PROGRAMS. THAT ARE TAILORED AND DESIGNED TO THE UP FRONT START OF A LOT OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BRING THE COST DOWN. CASE IN POINT. THE NEW SOLAR HOME PART. GRAHAM THIS HAS BEEN THE STATE'S PREMIER SOLAR INCENTIVE PROGRAM. IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF ITS LIFE IT TOOK SOLAR PENETRATION ACROSS THE STATE FROM 1% 220% IN THREE YEARS. IF IT NOT FOR THAT PROGRAM. OTHERS THE STATE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN A POSITION ONE YEAR AGO TO ADOPT A STATEWIDE SOLAR MANDATE. AND NOW THAT THAT PROGRAM IS BEGIN THE RAMP DOWN THE STATE IS LOOKING AROUND GOING K. WHERE WE GOING NEXT AND WE NOW KNOW IT'S ELECTRIFICATION IS FULL EXTRICATION IS EVEY CHARGING ITS BATTERY STORAGE. ELECTRIC WATER HEATING ELECTRIC SPACE HEATING AND PROBABLY TECHNOLOGIES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT YET. THAT WILL COME ALONG IN THE FUTURE [inaudible] YEAH. PASSING THIS BILL IS GOING TO IMPACT ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THE RISK. THAT A THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR OR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR INCENTIVE ON EACH AND EVERY HOME. IS GOING TO TRIGGER PREVAILING WAGE AND RISE THE COST OF EACH AND EVERY HOME BY EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS MINIMUM. THERE'S MUCH HIGHER PRICES IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE STATE. SO FOR THAT WE HAVE OFFERED AN AMENDMENT WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN WORK ON KATHLEEN NOT RESIDENTIAL -- WE LOOK FOR TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION -- BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW WE'RE VERY OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. YOU DON'T HI CAM STONE ON IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HAS LONG AND CAPABILITY DETERMINED WHETHER I PROJECTS AS SPENDING IS DE MINIMUS OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN DOING SO SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIVE AS GOVERNOR BROWN NOTED IN -- HIS VETO MESSAGE A VERY SIMILAR. LEGISLATION HE SAID AND I QUOTE. LONGSTANDING PRACTICE HAS BEEN TO VIEW THE SUBSIDY IN CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT. WRESTLED FOR DETERMINATIONS THERE HAS BEEN NO SHOWING THAT THE CURRENT PRACTICES UNREASONABLE WHILE I REMAIN A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF PREVAILING WAGES I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS MEASURE IS TOO RESTRICTIVE AND MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WE AGREE ON RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU STONE. THEN I BECOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. BUT OUR OP [inaudible] TO MINIMIZE [inaudible] THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. VERY GOOD THANK YOU HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND. TO THE CBA'S CONCERNS SUCH. DIFFICULT ON THE SOLAR. SURE [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY -- YOU KNOW. A COUPLE THINGS AND AND THAT PROGRAM THAT WAS REFERRED BEEN TAKING APPLICATIONS FROM DEVELOPERS. BUT BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY. I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. I'M AS WE DO RAMP UP AS A STATE A GREEN BUILDING OUR GREEN ENERGY -- BUILDING IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND -- WHAT KIND OF? FUTURE WE WANT FOR OUR STATE. AND YOU KNOW AS WE RAMP BUT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SKILLED TRAINED WORK FORCE. THE THAT WE CAN RELY ON DURING THIS TRANSITION WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE DON'T WILL HAVE A WORK FORCE THAT IS RELYING ON LOW WAGES OR A DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY -- THAT IS PARTNERING WITH THE STATE ON GREEN BUILDING BY RELYING ON LOW WAGES. THERE'S A REASON WHY I IS OFTEN TIMES YOU KNOW THOSE OF US AND I KNOW THAT. MANY THE SENATORS HERE CERTAINLY BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT ON THE IN IT IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. AND IS ALSO. AND AND YOU'VE ALSO BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT IN TERMS OF PROTECTING WORKERS. YOU CAN DO BOTH. AND THERE'S AN UNDERSTAND. CONCERN FROM THE BUILDING TRADES AND OTHERS IN LABOR. WENT AWAY ME TALK ABOUT PHASING OUT FOSSIL FUEL JOBS WE TALK ABOUT THESE GOOD HIGH PAYING HIGH WAGE SKILLED JOBS THAT WRITTEN A PHASE OUT ARE WE GOING TO PHASE THEM OUT FOR A LOW END. MINIMUM WAGE JOBS. ADDITION TO THE GREEN ECONOMY ARE WE GOING TO CREATE A GREEN ECONOMY THAT TRULY BUILDS UPON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WHAT WE HAVE DONE AS A STATE IN TERMS OF BUILDING A OF AN? UNPARALLELED BUILDING TRADES AND SKILLED WORK FORCE WE WANT THAT TO CONTINUE IF WE TRULY WANT TO SEE TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO THE GREEN ECONOMY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE SON CON ME THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. AND SO I DON'T BUY THE ARGUMENT THAT WE CAN'T DO IT. BECAUSE WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND WE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DO IT AND NO ONE IS FORCING A DEVELOPER TO TAKE A SUBSIDY THIS IS TAXPAYER MONEY. WE HAVE WE'RE GONNA USE TAXPAYER MONEY TO TRANSITION INTO THE GREEN ECONOMY WE HAVE TO WE CANNOT DO IT ON THE BACKS OF WORKERS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT BY CREATING A WORKFORCE THAT SKILLED AND THAT AS LIVING WAGES AND CAN FURTHER. BUILD UPON OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY [inaudible] THANK YOU -- NOW TAKE THAT IS A CLOSE YES THANK YOU MISTER OF YES SORRY. SENATE OVER -- DEVICE HERE. THANK YOU SIR. IS IT YOUR INTENT THAT THIS BILL WILL ARM. ALSO APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS. IT APPLIES TO RESIDENTIAL THAT IS NOT EXEMPTED AND THERE'S PLENTY OF EXEMPTS INCLUDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ONE THAT I KNOW. THAT -- MANY IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT BILLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- A DISINCENTIVE ISING SO IT I HEARD THERE ARE A NUMBER. OF EXEMPTIONS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST UNDERLAY BECAUSE SEVENTEEN TWENTY INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS AS WELL. BUT IN GENERAL IF THE SUBSIDY IS COMING FROM A GOVERNMENT ENTITY IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL WITH THE EXEMPTIONS THAT EXIST ABOUT NOW YOUR OPPONENTS SUGGEST HAVE SOME SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE. WELL I'M WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANYONE THAT HAS SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AS MALE TAKE THEM ABOUT THEIR WORLD WERE HARD MY DOOR IS AND CONTINUE TO BE OPEN. TO OFFERS OF SUGGESTIONS AND SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM -- IF THERE'S A MEETING OF THE MINDS CERTAINLY. BUT THOUGH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE POSITION THAT SOMEHOW WE CAN'T. MOVE FORWARD WITH THE GREEN ECONOMY IN THESE GREEN ENERGY. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS IN THIS AMOUNT I THINK IS A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT AS TO THAT. YEAH I HAVE USED TO BE -- INVOLVED WITH THE BILLING AND REAL ESTATE SO WHAT WORRIES BECAUSE SOME. YOU KNOW I HAVE. CHILDREN THAT ARE YOUNG AND THAT FIRST TIME HOME BUYER MARKET ONE OF THE MAIN DEMOGRAPHICS LEAVING CALIFORNIA ARE ACCORDING TO WHO WE ARE. HOOVER INSTITUTE -- HOW MONEY WALKS BUT THEY RECOMMENDED TO ME YES -- YOUR HIGHLY EDUCATED YOUNG PROFESSIONALS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE THIRTY NINE ONE OF THE REASONS IS HOUSING. AND SO WITH EVERYBODY'S TELLING US WERE IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND SO ALL THE STUFF GOING TO RAISE THE COST A HOUSING -- WHICH IT HAS BEEN AND SO THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW WORRY ME AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS CONCERNING ME. COULD COULD COULD YOU EXPLAIN IF SIR. I MEANT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS ON CLEAR ON THAT YEAH HAPPY TO I I THINK I'D SAY TWO THINGS THE EXEMPTION THAT'S BEEN REFERENCED -- IT IS IN THE CODE IT IS C. ONE IT IS REFERRED TO MOST COMMONLY AS DE MINIMUS EXEMPTION. WITHIN THAT EXEMPTION THERE IS AN EXCEPTION. WITH. WITH AGREEMENTS WITH STATE AGENCIES. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. GRAMS HI THAT THE STATE IS PROMULGATING THROUGH. IS THE C. E. C. THE CPUC OR OTHER SO THERE'S AN EXIT AN EXCEPTION TO THE EXEMPTION. IN THE CODE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A PROBLEM. SO THE AMENDMENT THAT WE PUT OUT THERE WAS TO ACTUALLY SAY THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT SHALL NOT APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. IT WAS NOT TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF THE 2%. IT WAS TO SAY WE CAN WE CAN ABIDE BY THAT WE THINK IT CAN WORK BUT THE TO INNER CITY FIVE IS GOING TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO PLAY WITH THIS BILL. IN THE TERMINOLOGY USED DIFFICULT. WHAT IS THAT SPECIFIC WENT MEAN I I WOULD ASSUME THAT MEANS HIGHER COSTS PASSED ON? TO THE POTETIAL HOMEOWNERS THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN. AGAIN SO YOU FOR OUR CIA. A WE HAVE LOTS OF NUMBERS THAT SHOW THAT COST DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN -- PREVAILING WAGE IN ON TWENTY FOURTEEN I CITED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT NUMBER COMES FROM A TWENTY FOURTEEN STUDY OF A TWENTY SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOUSE THE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WAS OUT. JUST OVER THIRTY THREE DOLLARS THAT WAS. TWENTY FOURTEEN AS MEMBERS OF CB I BROUGHT THEIR NUMBERS -- IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF ESPECIALLY IS THERE BEEN DISCUSSIONS. ON IN OTHER AREAS OF OF LABOR TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER -- THERE HAVE BEEN BOOKS. AND INFORMATION HAS BEEN SHARED THAT IS SHOWING THAT THAT NUMBER IS. FIFTY DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARSA SQUARE FOOT SO WE TIME ISN'T. VERY LARGE NUMBERS AND THOSE NUMBERS. WILL. MAKE THE BUILDER SO RISK ADVERSE THAT. THEY WILL NOT BE MOVING FORWARD ANY THESE EFFORTS ON GREEN ENERGY EFFICIENCY OR WHATEVER THEY ARE. THANK YOU FOR THAT THOUGH. WE DO -- YES. THANK US SHARE I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE A CONTINUE DEBATE ON THE NUMBERS BUT ALSO BE TO PAY FOR THAT DIFFERENTIAL ONE OR THE OTHER. BY CREATING A LOW WAGE WORKFORCE THAT CAN AFFORD HOUSING SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT BEING IN SILICON VALLEY THIS OFFER ENGINEERING YOUNG FAMILY TWENTY FOUR TO LIVE -- IN SILICON VALLEY ALMOST CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE INSTALLING SOLAR DOES A STYLE INSTALLING THIS PRODUCT BUILDING THE HOMES. I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE BAY AREA AND THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL FOR THREE HOURS AND HOURS. OF WORK TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS JUST TO HEAD BACK HOME IN THEIR HOME IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- AND THE REALITY IS THAT WE CAN DO BETTER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND ALL WORKERS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS MUCH DARKER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE WE JUST ADD TO THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS THAT THE MAKING A CLARIFICATION TO THE SECTION OF LAW IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT A CALLOUS TO FIND OUT ABOUT THESE KIND OF INCIDENTS RIGHT AWAY IF THAT A DIFFERENCE OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR FORTY EIGHT HOURS CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN FINDING OUT. WHAT HAPPENED WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO GO OUT AND DO AN IMMEDIATE INSPECTION TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING THAT BY DEFINITION BECAUSE A VERY SERIOUS INCIDENT IF NOT A FATALITY IS TAKEN CARE OF IN A TIMELY FASHION -- I VOTE.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARAMBULA WELCOME. THANK MOVING TO ITEM NUMBER. ELEVEN AB. TWELVE TWENTY THREE I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB. TWELVE TWENTY THREE REGARDING LIVING ORGAN DONATIONS. NEARLY SIXTY NINE HUNDRED LIVING DONOR TRANSPLANTS WERE PERFORMED LAST YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES. INCLUDING SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR MANY PATIENTS AN ORGAN FAILURE AN ORGAN TRANSPLANT CAN BE THEIR ONLY REMAINING MEDICAL OPTION. UNDER CURRENT LAW LIVING ORGAN DONORS ARE ALLOWED UP TO THIRTY DAYS OF PAID LEAVE AFTER SURGERY TO FULLY RECOVER. JOHN HOPKINS MEDICINE REPORTS THAT FULL RECOVERY FROM ORGAN DONATION. TAKES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR TO SIX WEEKS WITH SOME PATIENTS NEEDING EVEN MORE TIME. LIVING DONORS ALSO EXPERIENCED DISCRIMINATION WITH SOME INSURERS AND DO NOT HAVE EXPLICIT JOB. WELL THEY RECOVER FROM ORGAN DONATION SURGERY. FOR EXAMPLE A STUDY AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH DEMONSTRATED THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF KIDNEY DONORS. HAD DIFFICULTY CHANGING. OR INITIATING INSURANCE PLANS AND IT WAS PARTY FIRST PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT WITH LIFE INSURANCE. AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE SIX TO ADDRESS THESE HURDLES. FOR ORGAN DONATION WITH A TWO PRONGED APPROACH. FIRST AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE WOULD ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL ON PAID LEAVE OF UP TO THIRTY BUSINESS DAYS. IN A ONE YEAR PERIOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF ORGAN DONATION. THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT AN EMPLOYEE FIRST MUST EXHAUST ALL AVAILABLE SICK LEAVE. BEFORE TAKING THIS ON PAID LEAVE. BY ADDING THIS OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL ON PAID LEAVE IF NEEDED. POTENTIAL ORGAN DONORS WILL HELP COMFORT KNOWING THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE NECESSARY TIME FOR A FULL RECOVERY WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOBS. SECOND AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT INSURERS. FROM DECLINING. READING OR LIMITING COVERAGE OF A PERSON UNDER A LIFE OR DISABILITY INSURANCE POLICY. SOLELY DUE. TO STATUS OF THE PERSON ASA LIVING ORGAN DONOR. THESE TWO APPROACHES IN TO REDUCE THE HURDLES FOR ORGAN DONATION. BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF SURGICAL RECOVERY TIME BY THIRTY DAYS. OF UNPAID LEAVE AND PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ORGAN DONORS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SCOTT SADLER WITH THE AMERICAN KIDNEY. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN HEALTH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON AB TWO OF TWENTY THREE THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON A PERSON'S STATUS AS AN ORGAN DONOR AND ONE SURE JOB ACCESS JOB. PROTECTED LEAVE FOR AN ORGAN DONATION. I REPRESENT THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN A K. F. AS A NATIONAL INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT THE FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS IS HELP PEOPLE FIGHT KIDNEY DISEASE AND LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES. WE RUN THE STE THE NATION'S LARGEST FREE KIDNEY HEALTH SCREENING PROGRAM I WORK EVERY DAY TO HELP PEOPLE PREVENT KIDNEY DISEASE AND DETECTED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. KIDNEY TRANSPLANT AXES A LITERAL LIFELINE FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING. FROM KIDNEY FAILURE. OFFERING THE CHANCE FOR A LONGER HEALTHIER LIFE. BUT THE SEVERE SHORTAGE OF AVAIL AVAILABLE ORGANS IN THE UNITED STATES MEANS THE MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. ARE WE THE DONATION. AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE WILL REMOVE THE BARRIERS FOR LIVING DONOR. LIVING ORGAN DONATIONS. WE BELIEVE THE GUARANTEEING JOB SECURITY WHEN THEY TAKE TIME OFF TO RECOVER FROM ORGAN DONATION SURGERY. AND PROHIBITING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ORGAN DONORS ARE NOT ONLY SENSIBLE PROTECTIONS BUT ALSO GOOD POLICY. FOR THESE REASONS WE ENCOURAGE DRIVE A GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MR TURN MEMBERS MEDICINE BY ON BEHALF OF DONATE LIFE CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT THE NO ONE IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM -- SENATOR PAN -- WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE.

B. FIVE NINETY THREE AND THEN WE WILL GO. TO ITEM FOURTEEN AB [inaudible] SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT AFTER THAT PLEASE PROCEED. WHEN THE RED AREA? GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT A. B.. FIVE NINETY THREE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD RUNNING CORNY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT. LOCAL BOARDS IN CALIFORNIA TOO VITAL WORK PROVIDING JOB TRAINING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND ARE DISTRICTS. IN LA COUNTY THE LA COUNTY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD ALONE PLACE OVER ONE THOUSAND CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LOCAL WORKFORCE SPORTS ARE MANDATED TO TRACK THE RETENTION RATES WAGES AND THE TYPE OF INDUSTRIES ARE FEDERAL PROGRAMS PARTICIPATE. PARTICIPANTS EARN AND WORK IN THEY DO THIS THROUGH THE BIG BASS WAIT FILE SECURE INFORMATION THAT IS. HOUSED IN THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE EDT. OUR ONLINE SYSTEM CALLED CAL JOBS. HOWEVER EDITH ABILITY TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH LOCAL BOARD THIS LIMITED BY THE CURRENT WORDING OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CODE. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS YOU I SEE. SINCE ALL PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ARE ALREADY ENTERED INTO CAL JOBS ET DE ALREADY COLLECTS THE DATA FOR NON FEDERALLY FUNDED PARTICIPANTS. BUT LACKED THE EXPLICIT. THAT MISSION TO SHARE THE DATA BACK WITH THE LOCAL BOARD AB FIVE NINE THREE MAKES CHANGES. TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CODE THAT ALLOWS LOCAL BOARDS AND CITY COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OR AGENCIES THAT ADMINISTER PUBLIC WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. TO ACT THIS QUARTERLY WAGE DATA IN ORDER TO EVALUATE RESEARCH OR FORECAST THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF PUBLIC WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. THE ANALYSIS -- RECOMMENDS THAT WE ADDRESS CONCERNS RACING REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY. I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR SPONSORS CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION THE D. E. AND THE D. EDT. TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS THANK YOU OF COURSE WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS ERIK FLORES WHO IS A POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU WE RECEIVED A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- WE REPRESENT THE FORTY FIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS OVER A HUNDRED OTHER. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SYSTEM INCLUDING K. -- TWELVE DISTRICTS A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS FALLEN BY OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THAT'S OVER. PRODUCTION I THIS DECLINE HAS LED TO A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS BACK FILLING THOSE OF FUNDS WITH ADDITIONAL STATE AND LOCAL DOLLARS AS WELL AS PHILANTHROPIC. SOME OF OUR BOARD SEE AS LITTLE AS 13% OF THEIR FUNDS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITIES ACT. THIS LEADS TO THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA CODE DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPRESSLY PERMIT LOCAL WORKFORCE AREAS ACCESS TO THAT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DATA. IF IT IS NOT PAID FOR BY FEDERAL DOLLARS -- WITH THESE DISPARATE FUNDING STREAMS IT MEANS THAT THE STATE IS ONLY GATHERED THROUGH THE ACTUAL LAKE WORK OF CASE MANAGEMENT CHECKUPS AEGEE PHONE CALLS. EMAILS FOR OP PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS TO BE ABLE TO REPORT ON HOW THOSE PROGRAMS AND PLACEMENTS ARE DOING. AB FIVE NINETY WOULD ALLOW LOCAL AREA TO REQUEST THAT BASE WHICH FILE FROM ET DE WITH THE RESPECT TO WITH RESPECT TO THE RESULTS OF STATE LOCAL OR PHILANTHROPIC THE FUNDED PROGRAMS. THIS WOULD ALLOW US OUR BOARDS TO USE THOSE OF FUNDS FAR MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE MOVE THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THAT DELAY WORKFORCE PROGRAMS BEING EVALUATED. WE WORKED AND RECORDED ON OUT WITH RESPECT TO WORKING WITH EDT WE HAVE HAD -- THEM IN THESE CONVERSATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE BILL AND IT TO WORKING WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THOSE PRIVACY CONCERNS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE STATE OF NEW YORK PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWED THEIR LOCAL WORK FORCE AREAS TO REQUEST THIS YOU Y. DATA THROUGH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. WE'RE WORKING WITH EDT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATION THAT IS IN PRACTICE TODAY AND THAT STATE CAN POTENTIALLY BE REPLICATED AND MATCHED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE SERVED OVER A ONE POINT THREE MILLION CUSTOMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THEM IN THE ON OVER THIRTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES THAT. HAVE STE BEEN SERVED THROUGH THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM AND CALIFORNIA'S. OUT.

WHEN THE PREVAILING WAGES REQUIRED ON PRE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY THERE IS? GEN BETWEEN AGENCIES CONTRACTORS AND LABOR GROUPS AROUND WHEN AND WHERE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS APPLY ON PRE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. STATE LAW MAKE THE CLEAR THE PRE CONSTRUCTION PHASES OF A PROJECT FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC WORKS. OF PREVAILING WAGE HOWEVER THE AMBIGUITY AROUND THE DEFINITION OF PRE CONSTRUCTION HAS LED TO CONFUSION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS. IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AS TO WHEN PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS APPLY FIGHT ASSESSMENTS FEASIBILITY STUDIES ARE CRUCIAL TO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND THEY TYPICALLY THE TERM AND THE SUITABILITY OF THE LAND WATER WHERE PROJECT IS. TO BE POTENTIALLY BILLS SIMPLY PUT UP A PROJECT WITH TYPICALLY NOT MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS ASSESSMENT OF THE LAND. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY WILL CLARIFY THAT PRE CONSTRUCTION ALSO RELATES TO PUBLIC WORKS. PROJECTS ALSO INCLUDE SITE ASSESSMENTS AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES TO ENSURE WORKERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ARE RECEIVING THE PREVAILING WAGE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED. TO FURTHER AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WILL SPECIFY THAT SITE ASSESSMENTS OF VISIBILITY STUDIES FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION OF PRE CONSTRUCTION REGARDLESS. OF WHETHER FURTHER CONSTRUCTION IS PERFORM AFTER THE ASSESSMENT IS COMPLETED HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TEMPERAMENTS POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE INTERNATIONAL. OPERATING ENGINEERS. THANK YOU MARTY A GOOD MORNING UP AS STATED -- WE BELIEVE THIS PLACE APPLIES CLARITY AWARDING AGENCIES -- CONTRACTORS ACTING AS BIDDERS AND ALSO FOR CEMENT ENTITIES FOR THE NO UP FRONT GOING AND THE PREVAILING WAGES IS REQUIRED AND USE OF APPRENTICES ARE REQUIRED.

VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION FROM A SENATOR PAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTIONS TO PASS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR HELD BY HILL AYE MORRELL. WELL NO JACKSON. MITCHELL HI MITCHELL AYE PAN. PAN. THE BILL HAS THREE VOTES WILL HOLD THE ROLL OVER FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT SIMILAR MAIENSCHEIN. WELCOME. WE'RE GOING TO ITEM NUMBER TEN A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR WELCOME AGAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT PROTECT WORKERS CALIFORNIA'S EPIDEMIC OF DEADLY WILDFIRES. CONTINUES TO WORSEN THE COMPLEX MIXTURE OF CHEMICALS AND SUBSTANCES FOUND IN WILD FIRES. CAN PENETRATE DEEP INTO THE LUNGS AND CAUSE SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS MILLIONS OF CUT INS WORK OUTDOORS AND RISK EXPOSURE TO THIS HAZARD. WELL REGULATIONS EXIST TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM GENERAL HAZARDS AN AIRBORNE EXPOSURES THESE REGULATIONS DO NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS. THE UNIQUELY UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF WILDFIRE SMOKE AB ELEVEN TWENTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE OSHA -- TO ADOPT THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO MAKE RESPIRATORS AVAILABLE TO OUTDOOR WORKERS ON ANY DAY THOSE WORKERS COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE EXPOSED TO HARMFUL LEVELS. OF WILD FIRE SMOKE HERE WITH ME TO TEST RIDE SUPPORTERS MISDIAGNOSIS THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FED FEDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE BUILDING TRADES WORK SAFE AND CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION -- TO BASICALLY IS SOLVE THE ISSUE THAT WE SAW HAPPEN A LOT LAST YEAR DURING THE WORST OF THE FIRES WHERE. WHEN THE AIR WAS EXTREMELY BAD IN MANY AREAS AROUND THE STATE WE WENT AROUND AND SAW THAT LOTS OF WORKERS WERE ESSENTIALLY FORCED TO WORK OUTSIDE IN THIS AIR? WITH NO PROTECTION OF ANY KIND AND THERE WASN'T MUCH INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS TO WHAT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WAS WHAT KIND OF MASK TO WEAR WHETHER OR NOT TO WEAR A MASK WHETHER WAS REQUIRED. SO IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT INTO THE REGULATIONS AND FOUND THAT THEY KIND OF RANGE FROM SO VEGAS TO BE ALMOST USED. TO SO CUMBERSOME THAT EVERYONE IS JUST KIND OF IGNORING THEM AND SO WE PETITION THE CALLUSES STANDARDS BOARD TO PROMULGATE SOME NEW REGULATIONS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND THAT PROCESS IS HAPPENING THERE'S BEEN AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THERE'S BEEN ONE HEARING. AND A FINAL VOTE IS TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR JULY EIGHTEENTH BUT THE BILL IS STILL NECESSARY TO BASICALLY KEEP THE PRESSURE ON THAT PROCESS. AS WE HEARD DURING THE TESTIMONY OF A QUIRK BILL THE WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY RULE MAKING PROCESS HAS A TENDENCY. TO DRAG ON FOR YEARS SEVERAL YEARS IF NOT LONGER AND OVER A SPAN OF TIME THAT LONG GIVEN THE SEVERITY AND FREQUENCY THE FIRES WERE LOOKING AT NOW THERE WILL BE WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS SO. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING HAPPENS IN TIME FOR THE BOOK OF THIS YEAR'S FIRE SEASON. IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC WEAKNESSES WITH THE RAGS THAT ARE THERE PARTICULARLY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR FOR EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT. RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND OF THE SUBJECTIVE WHENEVER YOU THINK AN EXPOSURE IS HARMFUL AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH THAT OVER TO A MORE CLEAR STANDARD OF WHEN THE AIR QUALITY INDEX REACHES A CERTAIN THRESHOLD. AND THEN ALSO TO DEAL WITH THE CUMBERSOME NATURE OF SOME OF THE REGULATIONS WHERE THEY'RE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO DO A MEDICAL EVALUATION AND FIT TESTING. OF EVERY SINGLE WORKER BEFORE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO WEAR ONE OF THE AN NINETY FIVE MASKS WHICH IS A REALLY FEASIBLE IF YOU'RE. A COUPLE HUNDRED OUTDOOR WORKERS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN A FIRE STARTS AND YOU'VE GOT TO BRING A PHYSICIAN AND TO PERSONALLY EXAMINE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IN THE SPAN OF A FEW HOURS IT'S JUST NOT. SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS VERY REALISTIC THE PALM BUT THE WAY MOST OF THESE FIRES HAPPENED SO -- THOSE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LANGUAGE BUT WE DO THINK THE BILL IS STILL NECESSARY THERE IS DEFINITELY -- THERE ARE SOME VOICES IN THE PROCESS THAT ARE TRYING TO SLOW IT DOWN THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THE NATURE OF EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND SO THE BILL IS STILL VERY MUCH DOING WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO AND HELPING KEEP THE PROCESS WORKING THE WAY THAT -- THAT WE THINK IT NEEDS TO TO WORK BEST FOR WORKERS WE ARE TONIGHT. GOOD THANK YOU -- YES THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A GREAT MANY OF OUR WORKERS WORK OUTSIDE AND SO ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE SOME RESPIRATORY PROTECTION. ARE DURING THE WILDFIRE SEASON WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT THANKFULLY A GREAT MANY OF THE UNITED CAN CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE. DO YOU OFTEN SHUT DOWN WORK OF BUT NOT ALL OF THEM AND CERTAINLY IN THE NON UNION CONSTRUCTION SECTOR THAT'S NOT THE CASE. SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED THE STANDARDS BOARD STAFF AS IN THE DIVISION STAFF HAS WORKED SO HARD TO GET THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. ON ROUND THE CUSP OF BEING FINISHED BUT HAVING THIS BILL OUT THERE KEEP THE PRESSURE ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT YOU ARE WATCHING. THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE THINK IS -- A VERY IMPORTANT TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD FOR THAT REASON SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. SACRAMENTO MAY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA THAT A CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS WE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE BUILDING TRADES AND HAPPY TO BE ON STRONG SUPPORTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MORNING CHRIS CON REPRESENTS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER KHAN. A DRY RIVER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND THE UTILITY WORKERS UNION AT THE PORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEING NO ONE EXCELLENT BILL THANK YOU LEADERSHIP IN THIS IN THE IN KEEPING UP THE PRESSURE ON PUSHING THE FEAR GET SENATOR WRAP HIM. IT IS A QUESTION ABOUT -- AND AND THE EMERGENCY NATURE SEE OF A TEMPORARY EXEMPTION FROM -- FIT TESTING FOR RESPIRATORS AND I GUESS MY CONCERN IS IS THAT. IF A RESPIRATOR DOESN'T FIT APPROPRIATELY IT REALLY ISN'T SERVING ITS FUNCTIONS SO -- SO I GET THE IDEA THAT OKAY WELL YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GET A DOCTOR OUT THERE YOU KNOW IN THE FEW HOURS IT CETERA. CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT -- EXEMPTING FIT TESTING. MEANS THAT COMMANDER SENSE TIME PRESSURE BUT ALSO BASICALLY THE RESPIRATORS KNOXVILLE SERVICE FUNCTIONS SO IF WITH PEOPLE. ON COMEY FANATICAL FEEL THE OF YOU HAVE A MASK AND I GUESS THIS CASE IT'S FIRE BUT IF YOU ARE AN INSPECTION CONTROL. AND BILL USED EQUIPMENT L. AS A THING IS ACTUALLY SENSUALLY THE SAME IS NOT USING IT SO I WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT IN THE EXEMPTION. WE'RE NOT CREATE A SITUATION THAT. WORKERS FALSELY THINK THE OTHER PROTECTION WITH A RESPIRATOR WAY AND IT REALLY ISN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT FITTING WELL IT'S NOT BEING USED APPROPRIATELY WHATEVER SO CAN YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- YES SO THE EMERGENCY REGULAR REGULATORY LANGUAGE THAT IS BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW DOES INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT FOR TRAINING. AND THE TRAINING DOES INCLUDE AN APPENDIX THAT GETS INTO THAT VERY ISSUE SPECIFICS OF THINGS LIKE -- FACIAL HAIR VERY MUCH LIMITS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN AND NINETY FIVE THAT IT DOES NEED TO PROPERLY FIT THE NOSE AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. BUT THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS KIND OF FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN. NOTHING AND IN IN NINETY FIVE MASK WITH TRAINING THAT WORKS AS WELL AS THEY CAN BUT THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT YOU'RE RAISING ABOUT. HOW TO IF IT'S AS WELL AS A CAN IS ONE THAT WE PLAN TO GET MUCH MORE IN THE WEEDS OF DURING THE PERMANENT RULE MAKING PROCESS THAT -- SHOULD TAKE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IT SHOULD BE SOMETIME THIS SUMMER SO IT IS VERY MUCH A REAL ISSUE AND THE THE STANDARD THEY'RE MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A MEDICAL EVALUATION IF IT TESTING IS THERE FOR VERY GOOD REASON AND WE WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT IN ALMOST ALL CASES THAT STILL REMAINS AND SO WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO WE CAN THAT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE FEDERAL STANDARD BUT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE PLAN TO GET MORE INTO DURING THE PERMANENT. ROLE MAKING STANDARD BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT I MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO SOMETHING AND THAT THIS ISSUE OF WE CAN'T GET DOCTORS OUT THERE TO EXAMINE THIS MANY WORKERS THAT FAST DOESN'T LEAVE THEM WITH NOTHING WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT THE CURRENT REGULATIONS. TO WELL I I WOULD I WOULD JUST FOR AND RECOGNIZE ARE STILL WORKING ON THE ISSUE I I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS FIRST OF ALL WILL BE SURE. TO GIVE PEOPLE FALSE SENSE OF PROTECTION RIGHTS -- HERE'S A MASK. BUT THEY'RE NOT WEARING CORRECTLY SO WHAT AT THE OFFICE OR OTHER THINGS -- PERHAPS WITH FIT TESTING TO COULD BE SOME WAY OF TRAINING CERTAIN. ALREADY OUT IN THE FIELD AND HOW TO APPROPRIATELY YOU KNOW HAVING DONE AND THEN. FIVE FIVE THANK YOU COULD SO I I MIGHT JUST BE THE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GONNA HAND OUT MASKS. BECAUSE IT'S AN EMERGENCY WHEN A WAVE THE FIT TESTING BUT THEN ESSENTIALLY NOW THEY HAVE AMASSED A SLAP IT ON BUT IT'S NOT REALLY PERFORMING ITS FUNCTION. AND THEN WHAT I AM IS THE WORKER FALSELY THINKS THE PROTECTED RIGHT WE WANNA BE SURE TO ACTUALLY PROTECTED AND SO -- MAYBE THERE'S A WAY. TO TO DO IT IN A WAY WHERE PERHAPS YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD TO FREE THEM PRE TRAINED OR YOU PRE TRAIN THAT RECOGNIZING YOU KNOW THAT. BEFORE YOU SEND THEM OUT TO THE FIELD IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG TO TEACH SOMEONE HOW TO FIT THEIR MASK NOW SO THAT THEY'RE READY. TO HAVE SOME EDUCATION ON HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE I JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE RECEIVING MASKS. THAT DARK NIGHT WEARING APPROPRIATELY SO I REALIZE YOU'LL SUPPORT THE BILL HE GONNA WORK THAT OUT BUT I REALLY THEM MIGHT BE SURE THAT. THERE'S SOME WAY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET EDUCATION ABOUT FIT TESTING -- OTHERWISE THE MASK IS REALLY NOT THEY'RE GONNA THINK THEY HAVE PROTECTION AND THAT I'D ALMOST PREFER THAT THEY'RE NOT OUT IN THE FIELD AND TELL HIT THAT TESTING BECAUSE I OTHERWISE THEY'RE EXPOSED AND THEY THINK THEY HAVE PROTECTION THEY DON'T. THAT IS IN THE APPENDIX A OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR THAT SPECIFIC KIND OF TRAINING. THE REJECTED YEAH I JUST MIGHT ADD HAVING GONE TO A FIRE THAT WAS BURNING FOR FORTY DAYS WERE ALL WEARING MASKS SOME MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS SO I THINK IT'S PORTANTINO THAT. PEOPLE NOT HAVE THAT FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING IN THE FIELDS ARE JUST. TRYING TO COPE WITH THE THE THE SMOKE THE COMES IN I THINK SACRAMENTO HAD THAT. OF A FEW MONTHS AGO SO. I THINK IT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE EDUCATE. BOTH YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS FOLKS YOU KNOW WORKERS WHO DO SPEND. WAY TOO MUCH TIME OUT THERE DURING THIS KIND OF DANGEROUS WEATHER. YOU KNOW THE COMMON TO LIKE CLOUD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS TO TRY. TO MAKE FIND THAT BALANCE AND I ALSO UP WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY TO CITY COUNCIL THE TWO WORST. WELL FOR AS WE EVER HAD WERE -- THREE OH SEVEN WERE MY DISTRICT AND SO WE DID HAVE A LOT OF THIS IS KIND OF EVEN. THOUGH THREE ONE IN PEOPLE THERE'S HARDLY ANYONE THAT WAS WEARING A MASK -- AND SO IS JUST. IT WASN'T AS PEOPLE WORKING IT WAS JUST CITIZENS AND AND AND PEOPLE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS SO THIS IS IMPORTANT I THINK THIS SEPARATE DIRECTION WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES THAT THAT THAT YOU RAISED A PARTICULAR DR GRANT. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST NOT ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM US SENATOR FAN OF WHICH WILL.

WERE UNKNOWN ITEM THIRTEEN AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO SEE YOU YOU GUYS HE WAS WELL GOOD MORNING THE MORNING COLLEAGUES AND STAFF. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT CONFORMS THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACTS THE F. R. A. TO THE UNIQUE WORK SCHEDULE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS. AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE IN THE FEDERAL FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT FMLA. THE SEER FRA ALLOWS FOR EMPLOYEES TO TAKE TWELVE WEEKS OF PAID OR UNPAID JOB PROTECTED LEAVE AND KEEP THE SAME HEALTH COVERAGE IF THEY HAVE WORKED. ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK FULL TIME FLIGHT CREW MEMBERSWORK A SCHEDULE OF THREE TO FOUR DAYS. AND THIS DOES NOT MAKE THEM ELIGIBLE FOR THE CFRA THIS MEANS THAT DURING VULNERABLE TIMES FLIGHT CREWS DO NOT HAVE ALL THE PROTECTIONS OF THE CFRA MOST NOTABLY THEY MAY OR MAY NOT KEEP THEIR EMPLOYER. IT HEALTH INSURANCE AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT WOULD MORE PROBABLY APPROPRIATELY USE THAT FEDERAL FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT WORK OUR REQUIREMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR HOURS. FOR FLIGHT CREW C. F. R. A. ELIGIBILITY DURING FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ONE SHOULD NOT BE WORRYING ABOUT BEING ON ENSURE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS TO FOCUS ON THEIR FAMILIES. I BELIEVE A. B. C. SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT EXTENDS THESE VALUABLE BENEFITS. TO FLIGHT CREWS AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY DONE UNDER THE FMLA.

FLIGHT ATTENDANTS I WORK IN A SINGLE THREE OR FOUR DAY -- TRIP PER WEEK ARE OFTEN EXCLUDED FROM CFR A PROTECTIONS UNDER THE CURRENT TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY HOUR. REQUIREMENT -- BECAUSE OF THIS EXCLUSION FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE UNABLE TO TAKE SEE IF OUR A PROTECTED LEVY CARE FOR CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY -- IF THEY BECOME ILL OR INJURED. ADDITIONALLY CFRA PROVIDES A UNIQUE LEAVE FOR NEW MOTHERS -- THAT INTERSECTS WITH FMLA TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL JOB PROTECTED LEAVE -- AND THE RETENTION OF EMPLOYEE HEALTH -- PROVIDED BENEFITS -- AT A TIME WHEN MOTHERS AND CHILDREN NEED TO RETAIN THOSE HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS MOST -- THIS A COMMONSENSE THE SOLUTION THAT BRING CFR A IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL FMLA STANDARD -- BY LOWERING IT THE LOWER IN THOSE WORK REQUIREMENT HOURS TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR HOURS FOR THESE REASONS TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION OF AMERICA AND THE TV YOU CALIFORNIA STATE CONFERENCE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB.
