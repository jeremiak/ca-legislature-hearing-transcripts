offshore wind development.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.951
My name is Mike McGuire and I'm

schedules. To be able to be here

00:00:58.525 --> 00:00:59.159
today we are bringing out some

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.861
additional chairs we have a full

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.796
house and we're grateful for

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:03.463
that.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.765
And we welcome you to the edge

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.700
of the humble bay in those who

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.669
are watchin are streaming

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.437
broadcasts here about

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.439
California's burgeoning Pacific

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.040
after when industry.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.841
And how it's emerging is a

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.843
critical component of our fight

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.612
against climate change.

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.514
And while this industry will be

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.449
an important source of power in

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:23.016
the golden state's energy

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.484
portfolio.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.152
It's equally important I think

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.820
that we can all agree equally

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.855
important to protect the golden

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.457
state's fishery in wildlife

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.559
resources where offshore wind

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:34.494
turbines would be located.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.463
Our focus today being the joint

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.030
committee on fisheries and

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.498
aquaculture is simple.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.567
California needs to ensure this

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.636
new green energy source does not

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:44.638
harm our fisheries wildlife and

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.707
the local economy that depends

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.109
on a thriving natural resource.

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:50.777
And as you all know California

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.846
has been a leader in this nation

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.715
by establishing an ambitious a

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.518
bold goal of relying entirely on

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.454
zero emission energy for its

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.656
electricity by.

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:03.357
Twenty forty five governor Jerry

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.891
Brown signed a senator daily own

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.060
bill mandating the electricity

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:10.664
target in early September.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:11.264
Two thousand eighteen he also

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.666
issued an executive order

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.668
calling for a statewide a

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.570
statewide carbon neutrality

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:18.705
meaning California removes is

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.641
much carbon dioxide from the

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.611
atmosphere as admits by.

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:25.278
Twenty forty five the Los

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.713
specific requires that 50% of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.582
the golden state's electricity

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:29.249
to be powered by renewable

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:32.886
sources by. 202560% by twenty

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:34.755
thirty while calling for a bold

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:40.761
path forward 1100% zero carbon

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.596
electricity by.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.263
Twenty forty five and I think

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.830
that most of us in this room.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.665
I know I do support this

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.566
initiative and we wanted

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:47.300
knowledge the hard work of the

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:50.570
redwood coast energy authority
--

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:54.574
RC a has been advancing -- And

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.242
have been statewide leaders

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.044
focus on offshore wind we have

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.979
some commissioners were here

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.580
today we want to acknowledge him

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:01.214
and say thank you for all their

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.616
work.

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.851
And we also need to expedite the

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.653
work of the task force that was

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.588
created by the federal and state

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.289
governments to put meat on the

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.058
bone when it comes to rules and

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.026
regulations. To protect fishing

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.828
grounds and our coastal

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:17.030
environment where turbines would

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:17.731
be located.

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:19.099
In many cases turbines would be

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:20.600
place.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.803
Where there are high winds?

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.771
Those high winds owns also

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.140
coincide with up weld waters.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.942
These waters have high levels of

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.944
nutrients which mean there are

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.579
high levels of food sources

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:34.581
which means there are robust

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:35.248
fisheries and marine life in the

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.585
same locations were potential

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:39.152
turbines would be located.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.954
We also need rules and

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.689
regulations for the large

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.591
electric connector cables

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:45.258
connecting the turbines with the

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.160
grade would be laid out on the

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.728
sea floor.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.731
And address the ongoing

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:51.431
maintenance and operations that

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:52.833
would potentially impact fishing

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.768
grounds insensitive ocean

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.703
habitat.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.572
California has to get this right

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.841
we will get this right and it's

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:01.374
time to involve the stake

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.743
holders on a statewide

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.811
regulatory process you're gonna

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:06.613
hear from the C. E. C..

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.280
As well was born that they have

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.082
launched a series of community

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:11.051
hearings up and down the state.

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.186
For us today we need to be a

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.188
start button that meet under the

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:15.856
bone.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.190
Our number one goal of today's

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.925
hearing is to hear from all of

We have an all star lineup of

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.731
panelists.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:26.767

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:43.616
The potential demand for

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:44.250
offshore wind energy on the

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.318
Pacific coast has never been

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:46.986
greater.

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:48.955
With California's target of

state of California industry and

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.309
other ocean users since October

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.444
of twenty sixteen to help to

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:13.279
identify areas that may be

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:17.283
suitable for future offshore

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.984
wind development.

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:19.419
Bones renewable energies leasing

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:21.187
strategy is founded on a process

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:23.123
that requires extensive planning

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:25.091
and analysis.

00:10:25.158 --> 00:10:25.625
Partnerships with state

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:27.293
stakeholders and other

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.095
governmental agencies.

00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:31.397
Bombs renewable energy program

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:35.101
occurs in four distinct phases.

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:35.735
We have a planning and analysis

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.103
face.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.074
Leasing site assessment and

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.774
construction and operations.

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:43.409
In California we're at the early

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.211
phase of the process in the

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:47.180
planning and analysis face.

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:49.149
During this phase we seek to

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:51.251
identify suitable areas for wind

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.119
energy leasing consideration.

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:53.753
Through collaborative

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.355
consultative and analytical

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.257
process sees that engage

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:01.060
stakeholders tribes and state

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:01.728
and federal agencies.

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.263
Bom recently issued a call for

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.298
information on the nation.

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.233
On October nineteenth. Twenty

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.168
eighteen one three call areas

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:11.171
one on the north coast into into

00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:11.771
central coast.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.373
Received over one hundred

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:15.475
comments and fourteen companies

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:17.310
submitted nomination of interest

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.412
in leasing for all three call

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:21.114
areas.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.082
The comments the nominations

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:23.650
received are now posted on a

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:25.118
bomb website.

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:27.453
So the next stage of our process

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.122
is called the identification.

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.424
Bono use the information it

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:33.259
received and the call to inform

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:35.295
my decision to offer all or part

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.463
of the call area for commercial

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.098
wind leasing.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.267
Palmer will identify wind energy

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:43.102
areas.

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:43.770
If we determine that that there

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:47.140
are areas appropriate for

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:47.807
leasing consideration.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.509
Palmer then initiate a formal

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:51.377
environmental review of these

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.413
areas under the national

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:55.215
environmental policy act for

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:57.216
potential lease issuance.

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:59.419
So throughout the entire process

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.221
including early planning leasing

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.556
and then review of less C.
plans.

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:05.258
Mon strives to engage

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:05.925

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:42.074
California energy commission.

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:43.609
The energy commission as

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:44.277
California's primary energy

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.411
policy and planning agency we

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:47.413
work closely with state and

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.080
federal agencies utilities and

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:49.549
other stakeholders to develop

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.384
and implement.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.386
State energy policies.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.555
California has a long history of

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.189
strong leadership an ambitious

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:57.623
initiative to fight climate

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.358
change and promote clean energy.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:15:59.926
We've set high goals for

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:01.694
reducing greenhouse gas

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:03.329
emissions calling for reduction

00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:05.465
to nineteen ninety levels by.

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.600
202040% below nineteen ninety

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.702
levels by twenty thirty an 80%

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:13.339
below nineteen ninety levels by.

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:14.006
Twenty fifty one of California's

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:15.575
core strategies for reducing

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.410
greenhouse gas emissions is I.

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:18.044
renewable portfolio standard.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.745
Which that's targets for the

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.414
percent of energy sold to

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.616
customers that must come from

00:16:23.683 --> 00:16:24.283
renewable energy.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.551
The initial target was 20% by

00:16:25.618 --> 00:16:27.486
twenty seventeen but it has

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:29.455
increased several times and is

00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:31.557
now 50% by.

00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:33.493
Twenty twenty six and 60% by.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:34.126
Twenty thirty as you mentioned

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:35.895
earlier in addition to these

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.730
targets California also have the

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:39.532
goal of achieving carbon

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:41.467
neutrality by.

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:42.101
Twenty forty five so we are on

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.936
track to meet our energy and

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.671
climate goals in two thousand

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:46.305
sixteen we met our greenhouse

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:49.475
gas emission reduction goal.

00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:50.142
For twenty twenty and renewable

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:51.577
energy currently serves 32% of

00:16:51.644 --> 00:16:53.479
our energy demand.

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:55.848
Over the last ten or more years

00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:57.650
the energy commission has had an

00:16:57.717 --> 00:16:59.685
active role in planning for

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:00.386
different renewable energy

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:01.787
technologies in different parts

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:03.489
of the state.

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:04.190
Some examples of these planning

00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:05.725
efforts that we've been involved

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.460
in are the doesn't renewable

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:09.495
energy conservation plan.

00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:11.464
And the San Joaquin Valley least

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:12.098
conflicts fuller project.

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:13.599
The desert renewable energy

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:15.735
conservation plan as a landscape

00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:16.435
scale planning effort.

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:17.937
That conserves and manages plant

00:17:18.004 --> 00:17:19.772
and wildlife communities in the

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.440
desert regions of California

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:23.643
while facilitating the timely

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.444
permitting of compatible

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:26.078
renewable energy projects.

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:27.880
The San Joaquin Valley least

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:29.549
conflicts fuller project with

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:30.216
the stakeholder led process that

00:17:30.283 --> 00:17:33.553
helps identify more than four

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:34.220
hundred thirty thousand acres of

00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:34.820
land.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:35.621
Most appropriate for solar

00:17:35.688 --> 00:17:36.222
Peavey development in the San

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:37.623
Joaquin Valley.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.458
And analyze the transmission

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:41.527
capacity available to print to

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:43.763
bring Peavey generation on to

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:44.430
the existing grad.

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:45.932
Both of these planning efforts

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.767
were highly collaborative and

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:48.434
data driven.

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.769
They emphasize public outreach

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:51.871
and engagement throughout this

00:17:51.938 --> 00:17:53.506
planning processes.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:54.140
It's important when looking at

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:55.675
complex levels of planning

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.543
efforts to coordinate with all

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.177
of the agencies who will have a

00:17:58.244 --> 00:17:59.478
role in those efforts.

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.647
Are planning efforts have

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:02.348
involved is working closely with

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:05.484
both state and federal agencies.

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:06.152
In past efforts we will we've

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.720
worked closely with the bureau

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:09.555
of land management and the

00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:10.222
department of defense.

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:11.591
And now we're working closely

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:13.793
with bomb on planning for

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:14.493
offshore wind in California.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.962
The energy commission has taken

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:17.863
a lead role in coordinating the

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:18.464
state's participation in the

00:18:18.531 --> 00:18:19.765
task force.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:21.634
In this coordination role we

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:22.335
work closely with state and

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.803
local agencies such as the ocean

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.504
protection council.

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:26.138
The California coastal

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.807
commission the department of

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.775
fish and wildlife the California

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:30.409
public utilities commission and

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:31.744
the governor's office of

00:18:31.811 --> 00:18:33.612
planning and research.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.715
The task force has been active

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:36.382
for almost three years during

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.050
that time our priorities have

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.919
been to better understand the

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:41.554
potential constraints on offer

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.121
wind.

00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:42.822
They called out Richard

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.023
engagement information and data

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.591
gathering.

00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:46.125
And to identify research

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:47.693
opportunities.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.729
As bill mentioned with our state

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.363
and federal agency partners

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.897
we've held over AT outreach

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.599
meetings and webinars.

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.735
And on the north coast alone we

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.570
held meetings in Eureka crescent

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.672
city Trinidad and blue lake with

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.574
stakeholders such as the fishing

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.241
community environmental NGOs the

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:03.909
native American tribes.

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.611
And the public.

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:06.312
Last year we also held in

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:07.980
integrated energy policy report

00:19:08.047 --> 00:19:09.982
workshop in arcade it to hear

00:19:10.049 --> 00:19:11.617
about and discuss.

00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:12.251
The north coast regional

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:13.986
challenges opportunities and

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:17.590
solutions to meet California's

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.625
climate and clean energy goals.

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.594
The offshore wind resource along

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.261
the north coast some of the best

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:22.928
in the world.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:23.796
Transmission is one challenge

00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:25.698
that exist in the north coast.

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:27.767
However the potential call area

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.568
from north north coast in size

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:31.704
for local need avoiding some of

00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:33.606
those transmission constraints.

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:34.306
Offshore wind has real potential

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:35.941
to support our climate renewable

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.610
energy goals.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:38.277
Have the generation profile that

00:19:38.344 --> 00:19:39.612
complement fuller.

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.747
It can utilize existing on shore

00:19:41.814 --> 00:19:43.582
transmission infrastructure and

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:44.116
it promotes clean jobs and

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.618
investment.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.820
Given the potential value of the

00:19:47.887 --> 00:19:49.588
renewable resource and the parts

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:50.289
of the ocean and coastal

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.657
environment to Californians and

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:53.626
the local communities.

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:54.293
We believe that it is important

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.828
to continue improving our

00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:57.930
understanding of the potential

00:19:57.997 --> 00:19:58.631
constraints on offer wind

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:00.032
through our planning efforts and

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:02.001
continued out returning cater to

00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:03.636

Great I'm so they'll see her the

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:54.553
ocean protection councils a

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.723
cabinet level state agency.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.357
That is charged with protecting

00:20:58.424 --> 00:20:59.792
conserving.

00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:01.694
And maintaining California's

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.763

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:04.430
the benefit of current and

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:05.931
future generations we work at

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:07.766
the intersection of science

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:10.102
policy and management in four

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:11.804
ways.

00:21:11.871 --> 00:21:12.404
Taking down silos and

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:13.806
coordinating efforts with

00:21:13.873 --> 00:21:16.075
partners inside and outside of

00:21:16.142 --> 00:21:17.743
government.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:18.410
Insuring best available science

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:20.112
informs policy and management

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:21.747
decisions.

00:21:21.814 --> 00:21:23.849
Recommending actions to the

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:25.751
governor and the legislature to

00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:26.418
protect ocean and coastal

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:28.020
ecosystems and finally finding

00:21:28.087 --> 00:21:30.022
catalytic an innovative --

00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:32.091
Projects to advance scientific

00:21:32.158 --> 00:21:33.926
understanding and improving

00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:35.728
ocean hell.

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:39.732
Next slide please.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.034
Great -- So the OPC has a long

00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:43.903
history of working on marine

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.838
renewable energy issues in two

00:21:45.905 --> 00:21:47.940
thousand six it established a

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:48.641
state federal.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:50.142
Marine renewable energy working

00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:51.777
group to address the

00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:54.013
uncertainties in the regulatory

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:54.647
process.

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:55.881
In the information needs of

00:21:55.948 --> 00:21:59.752
agencies and stakeholders.

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:00.352
In December twenty eleven the

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.087
OPC adopted a resolution

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:04.056
specifically addressing marine

00:22:04.123 --> 00:22:05.724
renewable energy.

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:07.760
Among other things the

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:09.695
resolution acknowledge that wave

00:22:09.762 --> 00:22:11.697
title now sure win energy may

00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:12.331
help California meet its long

00:22:12.398 --> 00:22:13.732
term energy.

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:15.701
And carbon reduction goals

00:22:15.768 --> 00:22:17.736
create new jobs.

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:19.705
Diversify the state's energy

00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:20.406
supplies and reduce air

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:23.909
pollution from fossil fuel power

00:22:23.976 --> 00:22:24.610
generation.

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:26.078
In addition it directs the a PC

00:22:26.145 --> 00:22:28.047
to work with the California

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:28.647
energy commission on marine

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:31.717
renewable energy policy

00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:33.752
development initiatives.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:34.420
The OPC worked with the federal

00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:35.955
bureau of ocean energy

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.923
management and energy commission

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.591
and watching the inter

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.025
governmental renewable energy

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:41.760
task force in.

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:42.461
Twenty sixteen under the

00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:44.163
auspices of the task force over

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.131
the last two and half years we

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:47.900
help plan and conduct outreach

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:49.869
to the public fishermen tribes.

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:51.704
Vinyl groups and other

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.404
stakeholders to share

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:54.073
information and have discussions

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:55.975
around potential offshore wind

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.943
energy development on the north

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.912
and central coast.

00:22:59.979 --> 00:23:01.914
We're planning additional north

00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:02.548
coast out reach to fishing

00:23:02.615 --> 00:23:03.916
communities later this year.

00:23:03.983 --> 00:23:05.851
And early.

00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:06.485
Twenty twenty the OPC wants to

00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:07.920
ensure.

00:23:07.987 --> 00:23:09.822
That marine renewable energy

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:11.957
projects minimize impacts to

00:23:12.024 --> 00:23:13.826
coastal and marine environment

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:14.493
and the state agencies have

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.161
sufficient information to and

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.330
data to carry out their planning

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:19.865
and regulatory responsibilities.

00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:22.167
Relative to marine renewable

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:23.869
energy development.

00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:25.971
Consequently we're funding

00:23:26.038 --> 00:23:27.907
studies at UC Santa Cruz UC

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.875
Berkeley humble state
university.

00:23:29.942 --> 00:23:32.011
Then investigate the range of

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.812
potential impacts to the marine

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:34.480
coastal and terrestrial

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:36.081
environments that would result

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:38.250
from marine renewable energy

00:23:38.317 --> 00:23:38.951
development.

00:23:39.018 --> 00:23:40.119
The development of these studies

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:42.254
study concepts has resulted from

00:23:42.321 --> 00:23:44.123
close consultation with state

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:46.091
and federal agencies research

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:47.993
institutions and stake holders.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.928
Currently we're working with

00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:51.830
very closely with the department

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:53.832
of fish and wildlife energy

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:55.868
commission coast commission.

00:23:55.935 --> 00:23:56.435
Ball -- And humbled stay in

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:57.970
developing a study.

00:23:58.037 --> 00:24:00.005
That will investigate the

00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:00.673
potential impact of fishermen

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:03.842
from offshore wind development

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:05.878
on the north and central coast.

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:09.882
The PC strategic plan.

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:10.449
For twenty nineteen twenty

00:24:10.516 --> 00:24:11.150
twenty four includes an

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:13.919
objective to minimize impacts to

00:24:13.986 --> 00:24:14.586
the coastal marine environment.

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:16.055
Recreation and fishing

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:18.223
communities resulting from rain

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.359
renewable energy development.

00:24:20.426 --> 00:24:22.227

institutions to develop and fund

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.868
studies and projects.

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:30.502
That investigate.

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.037
The environmental impacts of

00:24:32.104 --> 00:24:33.973
deploying an operating marine

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:37.876
renewable energy technologies.

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:38.577
To collaborate with bone in the

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:21.954
information I would encourage

00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:25.958
folks to contact me get away I I

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:28.026
and to so we just discuss what's

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:28.594
on their mind.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.294
I really appreciate this

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.329
opportunity to provide testimony

00:25:30.396 --> 00:25:32.331
today they stop miss Parker

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:34.033
thank you so much for joining us

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:34.733
for grateful you're here will

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.268
have some questions -- After we

00:25:36.335 --> 00:25:38.103
hear from Dr bridge she's a

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.039
senior environmental scientists

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:40.739
with California coast commission

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.307
we appreciate your presence here

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:42.908
today the floor is yours you

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:43.976
have five minutes.

00:25:44.043 --> 00:25:45.978
Thank you very much.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:48.080
I can get my presentation appear

00:25:48.147 --> 00:25:48.747
at thank you so much for having

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:50.315
me today and again my name is

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:51.950
Kate talk a bridge I'm a senior

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:54.053
environmental scientists with

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:54.720
the California coastal

00:25:54.787 --> 00:25:56.321
commission -- And if you could

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.023
just skip to the second slide --

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.325
And I'll just continue talking

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.261
until they show up -- So as part

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:04.296
most of you are probably aware

00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:04.897
the California coastal

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:06.265
commission is charged with

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:08.100
regulating development on the

00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:09.968
coastal zone to ensure the

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:11.970
protection of coastal resources

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:14.006
as required by the coastal act.

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:14.706
Now the coastal act when we're

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:16.041
thinking about offshore wind the

00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:16.742
call select as a couple key

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:18.243
policies that will be focused on

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.312
as we review -- Offshore wind

00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:22.214
development -- Offshore

00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:24.249
California and those first two

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:24.883
policies I want to talk to I

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.351
think really aligned closely

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:28.253
with the goals in charge of this

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.022
committee so I wanted to

00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:30.656
highlight those.

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.024
The first is a protection of

00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.959
marine resources which include

00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:34.526
species habitats and water

00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:35.994
quality.

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:36.662
And the second is a protection

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:38.330
of fishing which includes both

00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:40.132
recreational and commercial

00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:40.799
fishing.

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:42.234
In addition to those policies

00:26:42.301 --> 00:26:43.969
because like include separate

00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:46.104
policies protecting public

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:47.973
access and recreation -- Minimum

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:48.574
minimization of impacts to

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.977
navigation and hazards --

00:26:52.044 --> 00:26:52.644
Protection of coastal public

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.513
views and protection of tribal

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.183
and cultural resources next

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.352
slide please [inaudible]

00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:00.953
So.

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:02.287
These projects are strewn

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:04.289
projects are incredibly complex

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:08.360
and they span a wide you know --

00:27:08.427 --> 00:27:09.061
G. R. right geographic area and

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:10.596
go through many jurisdictions so

00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:14.066
I created this very crude --

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:16.068
Diagram just to kind of walk

00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:16.368
through it.

00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:18.103
So.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:18.737
As we've been talking about in

00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:20.305
California were really

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:20.973
contemplating offshore wind

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.341
turbines out in federal waters

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:24.276
that's really the purview of the

00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:26.111
federal government through bone.

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:26.712
Does the power from those

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:28.447
turbines will be connected

00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:30.282
through cables that go through

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:30.916
both federal waters through

00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:32.484
state waters and then we'll

00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:34.386
connect on shore once they reach

00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:36.455
on shore they'll connected to

00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:38.257
our existing grid -- Now as part

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:40.092
of an overall offshore wind

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:40.792
project there may be components

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.561
on shore such as upgrades to our

00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:44.463
transmission system or upgrades

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.331
at the port to facilitate

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:48.133
construction of wind turbines.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.135
And that's all part of the the

00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:50.802
picture here.

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:51.436
Now the coastal commission is

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:52.437
unique I think I think among

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.473
federal and state agencies and

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.076
that we have a regulatory role

00:27:58.143 --> 00:28:00.112
in all of these areas.

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.080
So out in federal waters we have

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:02.781
federal consistency authority

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:04.249
and we'll be reviewing offshore

00:28:04.316 --> 00:28:06.518
wind at two different points one

00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:08.320
prior to the lease sale.

00:28:08.387 --> 00:28:10.188
And one as we get further down

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:10.822
the line and we're looking at

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:12.457
projects specific proposals.

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:14.593
In state waters the commission

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.195
has direct permitting

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:16.895
authorities will we will be

00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:18.530
providing a coastal development

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:20.499
permit for any cables that need

00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:21.166
to be installed.

00:28:21.233 --> 00:28:24.269
On shore -- Depending on where

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:24.870
the connection or the

00:28:24.937 --> 00:28:26.371
developments that that is

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:28.207
proposed a curse the commission

00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:28.874
either has direct permanence

00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:30.542
already or in the case where a

00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:32.377
local government or a port has

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:32.911
permanent thirty into the

00:28:32.978 --> 00:28:34.213
coastal lacked.

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:36.281
Most of those projects as energy

00:28:36.348 --> 00:28:40.519
projects are then appealable to

00:28:40.586 --> 00:28:42.221
the coastal commission.

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:42.888
So because the commission will

00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:44.189
be reviewing these projects in

00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:44.890
their entirety in some way and I

00:28:44.957 --> 00:28:46.258
think that's important to point

00:28:46.325 --> 00:28:48.493
out -- Next slide please.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.164
So what are we doing to address
--

00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:52.831
Impacts to California's

00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:56.168
fisheries and wildlife -- And

00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:56.868
the first thing I sort of want

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:58.370
to point out there is our is our

00:28:58.437 --> 00:29:00.272
general approach -- The goal is

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:02.307
to avoid impacts as much as

00:29:02.374 --> 00:29:04.543
possible -- If they if impacts

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.311
can be avoided we want to

00:29:06.378 --> 00:29:08.280
minimize and then fully mitigate

00:29:08.347 --> 00:29:10.482
those impacts and I just want to

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:11.183
make that really clear and the

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.651
way that that's accomplished now

00:29:12.718 --> 00:29:14.486
in the planning process is to

00:29:14.553 --> 00:29:15.053
cite.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.521
Lease areas and eventual

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:18.523
projects in locations that

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.525
accomplish those goals -- And

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.594
that's really what were we're

00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:24.196
working on the mitigation

00:29:24.263 --> 00:29:26.365
discussion is critical but we're

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.367
not there yet we're still

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:30.202
working on that try to avoid and

00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.802
minimize impacts.

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:32.237
I will get to mitigation a

00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:34.206
little bit further down the line

00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:36.341
at least the specifics of what

00:29:36.408 --> 00:29:36.808
that might look like.

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.243
So.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.910
I'm not gonna go to too much

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.312
detail on the activities going

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:40.946
on because you've heard that

00:29:41.013 --> 00:29:42.281
from the other panelists but

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:44.283
we're working with our state and

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:44.950
federal agency partners to

00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:46.518
collect and analyze data both

00:29:46.585 --> 00:29:48.253
existing data.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.289
Collect new data through studies
--

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:52.224
We are working to develop a

00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:52.891
thorough and transparent

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:54.459
regulatory process -- And then

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:56.528
it as but has been mentioned a

00:29:56.595 --> 00:29:58.230
lot of time and efforts been put

00:29:58.296 --> 00:29:58.897
into stakeholder outreach and

00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:00.532
collaboration and that will be

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:02.234
ongoing.

00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:04.236
Next slide please.

00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:04.936
So just before I conclude I want

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:08.307
to focus on sort of our big next

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:10.275
step and commission staff is

00:30:10.342 --> 00:30:12.244
really focused on preparing.

00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:12.911
For a federal consistency

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:14.513
determination that will occur

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.348
prior to the lease sale and we

00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:17.015
have been actively working with

00:30:17.082 --> 00:30:18.617
bom and all the other state

00:30:18.684 --> 00:30:20.485
federal agencies to ensure that

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:22.287
we have adequate information. To

00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:24.256
conduct that review.

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:26.458
I want to highlight this because

00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:28.293
I think this is the way the

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.228
store one regulatory opportunity

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:32.230
for the state and stakeholders

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:34.299
and the public to weigh in on

00:30:34.366 --> 00:30:34.800
the leasing and citing

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:36.268
discussion.

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.403
That's going on within a public

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.505
hearing setting so -- We will be

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:42.607
looking for input from all of

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:46.211
you and from agencies and

00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:46.912
anybody who would like to have

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.714
input -- Once that we go through

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.716
that phase and will be moving on

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:52.517
to really focusing on the

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:56.288
development of medication -- And

00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:58.223
monitoring strategies as we move

00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:58.890
forward an officer went.

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:00.692
So but that'll conclude thank

00:31:00.759 --> 00:31:02.260
you.

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:02.928
Thank you so much for really

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:03.628
grateful would like to be able

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:04.730
Ted just ask a few questions and

00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:06.565
we'll bring up our next panel

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:07.232
here.

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:08.533
I appreciate all of you again

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.435
for being here [inaudible]

00:31:10.502 --> 00:31:14.339
I'm -- Talk about the ideal date

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:16.441
when we're gonna see these

00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:17.142
studies back.

00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:18.844
And how you're going to be a to

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.379
bring them together.

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:21.046
Can you give us a brief synopsis

00:31:21.113 --> 00:31:22.514
about [inaudible]

00:31:22.581 --> 00:31:24.349
What each?

00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:26.385
At universities looking at in

00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:28.520
where you think our focus needs

00:31:28.587 --> 00:31:30.422
to be yeah I I can predict what

00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:31.123
should be a little bit -- In

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:32.824
them mark separates here he can

00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:36.328
talk a bit more in detail what

00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:36.928
we're finding at humble state

00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:40.365
but if you.

00:31:40.432 --> 00:31:42.567
Essentially they did that the

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:44.436
three primary projects that

00:31:44.503 --> 00:31:46.371
we're funding right now.

00:31:46.438 --> 00:31:48.507
We'll have results -- Within a

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.442
year's time frame and they will

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:52.377
be in our own products.

00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:54.613
That will -- That will be

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:58.483
delivered to the state -- In the

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.752
timing is such that that we

00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:02.587
think will note certainly help

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:03.288
the cost commission for instance

00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:06.391
with its consistency --

00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:08.593
Determination and and with some

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.364
of the planning that will be no.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.366
Rolling out appears well.

00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:16.368
So are you gonna go over.

00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:20.539
Yeah so well -- Leave the humble

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.173
state so.

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:22.541
Sure but okay so the the the

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.476
study that were funny at humbled

00:32:24.543 --> 00:32:26.645
is -- You just briefly go over

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.447
that exam so everyone okay great

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.482
so basically be looking at the

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:32.350
the impacts to the marine

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:34.419
environment -- The cost on

00:32:34.486 --> 00:32:36.488
firemen a look at some of the

00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:42.461
the port side issues -- It also

00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:44.362
be looking at I mean you know.

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:46.565
Yeah impacts in humble bay

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.600
itself perfect and they were

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:49.301
funny as study yet humble I'm

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:54.439
sorry at Berkeley that -- Looks

00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:56.608
at the potential work force --

00:32:56.675 --> 00:33:00.412
Ramping up in California for

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:02.347
after wind industry and then

00:33:02.414 --> 00:33:04.483
we're also funding -- A great

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:06.384
integration analysis.

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:08.820
And we're still working on the

00:33:08.887 --> 00:33:10.655
scope of of those two studies

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:12.891
but and we anticipate having

00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:14.493
that.

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:15.126
That done probably within the

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:16.862
next couple weeks and then

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.697
something that that is not

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:21.032
related Josh sure wind is to

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:22.834
study at UC Santa Cruz was just

00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:24.603
looking at the potential -- For

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:28.707
title energy along the

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:30.475
California coast.

00:33:30.542 --> 00:33:31.176
Tile yeah -- High it's actually

00:33:31.243 --> 00:33:32.811
broader than that it's the whole

00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:34.746
suite a marine kinetic it's not

00:33:34.813 --> 00:33:36.481
only title.

00:33:36.548 --> 00:33:38.750
I'm sorry ma'am what we're gonna

00:33:38.817 --> 00:33:40.785
have yeah I'm just waiting -- To

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:42.888
a Republican I know ma'am so we

00:33:42.954 --> 00:33:43.588
have a we compromise with you if

00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:45.056
you just want to write it down

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:46.825
and I will make sure we ask the

00:33:46.892 --> 00:33:48.627
question if that's okay with
you.

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:49.294
And we're actually right you get

00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:50.729
assistance with that -- In if

00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:51.429
you don't I just read your

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:54.866
question and we'll get right up.

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:55.534
Thank you.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.968
Which part or anything else no

00:33:57.035 --> 00:33:57.669
that's I think that's it okay

00:33:57.736 --> 00:34:00.772
thank you so much -- Talk to us

00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:01.039
about.

00:34:01.106 --> 00:34:02.607
What?

00:34:02.674 --> 00:34:06.544
On the international -- Side

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:08.480
we've seen.

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:10.482
Several countries.

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:11.082
Aggressively go after offshore

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:12.484
wind energy.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.486
Can you talk to us about.

00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:16.688
Lessons learned -- In what

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:20.692
California should avoid -- From

00:34:20.759 --> 00:34:22.827
other nations advancing wind

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.763
energy open the panel and I'm

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:25.230
gonna start with calls

00:34:25.297 --> 00:34:28.667
commission.

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:30.735
So I think I have a it's

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:32.837
probably a better question for

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.472
either Bowman energy commission

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:35.106
I think they've been a little

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:35.807
bit more engaged on the

00:34:35.874 --> 00:34:36.808
international front I will say.

00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:40.545
That we look forward to you too

00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:42.547
understanding what kind of

00:34:42.614 --> 00:34:43.248
process sees that was set up

00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:44.749
internationally that worked and

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:46.885
didn't work -- And the data they

00:34:46.952 --> 00:34:48.820
collected and what information

00:34:48.887 --> 00:34:49.421
did they used to make these

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:50.755
decisions now are optional

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:52.824
environment is not the same as

00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:54.626
either the east coast or

00:34:54.693 --> 00:34:56.494
internationally so it's not a

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:57.195
direct.

00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:59.030
Link -- But it part of it is for

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:00.932
me at least is understanding

00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:02.901
which process sees were put in

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:04.703
place like for engagement --

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:06.538
With different communities or

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.540
collection of environmental data
--

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:10.709
But I think we're still in the

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:12.544
process at least I am of

00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:14.512
figuring that out and what it.

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.213
Which ones work too much
Winston.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.948
When we go to bone anything that

00:35:17.015 --> 00:35:20.619
we especially want to avoid --

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:21.252
That may not have worked that

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:22.988
way -- They actually thought

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:25.023
would in anything any model

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.025
rules and regulations that you

00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:32.998
think -- The west should be

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:33.665
advancing.

00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:35.066
I'm I thinks certainly we need

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:35.700
to learn from those in Europe

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:36.868
involvement is international

00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:38.670
affairs office is engaged with

00:35:38.737 --> 00:35:40.805
that the various European

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:41.439
countries that have developed

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.774
offshore wind and we have

00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:44.642
agreements with them to try. To

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.845
periodically have -- Updates and

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:48.680
what they're doing and learn

00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:50.615
about you know lessons learned a

00:35:50.682 --> 00:35:52.751
lot of it primarily or though on

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:53.351
fixed foundations right now.

00:35:53.418 --> 00:35:54.886
So -- You know floating

00:35:54.953 --> 00:35:56.855
foundation is up and coming and

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.690
Wilk will begin to see that

00:35:58.757 --> 00:36:00.825
become more majority -- And will

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:02.594
continue to have those dialogues

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.261
with our international partners

00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:04.829
and to the extent that we can

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:06.564
bring that at the state level

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.232
and we certainly would would be

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:08.800
willing to do that.

00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:10.635
But we are engaging with our

00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:12.637
European partners to learn --

00:36:12.704 --> 00:36:14.572
What's been done there and what

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.574
didn't work or what would work

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:17.208
as it would apply to California

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:18.977
so going forward would be

00:36:19.044 --> 00:36:20.612
interested in.

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:24.649
Noble will -- Bring that down to

00:36:24.716 --> 00:36:26.618
the state that's great.

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:28.753
Twenty yes though -- Offshore

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.487
wind as an advanced -- Are much

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:30.655
more mature industry in Europe
--

00:36:30.722 --> 00:36:32.590
The energy commission does have

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:33.291
memorandums of understanding

00:36:33.358 --> 00:36:34.859
with both Denmark and Scotland.

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:38.663
That we completed in a two

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.364
thousand eighteen and so we're

00:36:39.431 --> 00:36:40.065
looking forward to working with

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:41.199
those countries to kind of learn

00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:42.867
from them as to what they've

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.736
done with their projects -- As

00:36:44.803 --> 00:36:46.704
they continue to monitor those

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.573
parties that have been sold what

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.207
they're seeing in terms of the

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:50.608
data.

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.677
In terms of you know I'm that

00:36:52.744 --> 00:36:54.746
production is coming from there
--

00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:56.748
Offer wind turbines -- You know

00:36:56.815 --> 00:36:57.415
any other issues that they're

00:36:57.482 --> 00:36:58.917
experiencing what they did to

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.652
get those projects completed --

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:02.587
Any medications they had with

00:37:02.654 --> 00:37:03.288
fishermen and other communities

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:05.090
and so we've already kicked off

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:06.791
the initial steps to learning

00:37:06.858 --> 00:37:07.492
from them.

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:08.893
We had a meeting in September --

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.829
Of last year with.

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.797
A federal agencies and Denmark

00:37:12.864 --> 00:37:14.866
and Scott wanted I set up Bates

00:37:14.933 --> 00:37:15.500
have a basis for learning from

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:17.001
them and how we could do an

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:18.636
information exchange.

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:19.304
And when you expect that to be a

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.139
coming back to this to the

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:23.241
energy commission into this
year.

00:37:23.308 --> 00:37:25.176
As far as the lessons learned

00:37:25.243 --> 00:37:27.011
that they would not repeat

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.880
except for when would that when

00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:29.547
would you be able.

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:32.817
To speak to that -- So it's I

00:37:32.884 --> 00:37:33.485
mean I don't know if there's a

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:34.886
certain time frame as to when

00:37:34.953 --> 00:37:36.755
they'll get us information back
--

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.756
What I think our next step is to

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:40.792
meet with stakeholders in this

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:41.392
off shore?

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:42.694
When planning out for and

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.394
identify key questions that we

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:45.230
need to ask them -- You know and

00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:46.998
provide those that those

00:37:47.065 --> 00:37:47.632
questions to Denmark and

00:37:47.699 --> 00:37:49.033
Scotland -- I think they're

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.035
willing and ready to provide us

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.104
with any information that they

00:37:53.171 --> 00:37:53.771
can.

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:54.806
We just need to identify what

00:37:54.873 --> 00:38:00.712
areas that were most concerned

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:02.747
with or misleading information.

00:38:02.814 --> 00:38:04.716
Thank you please part

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:05.016
[inaudible]

00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:05.650
Just.

00:38:05.717 --> 00:38:06.918
One I think that to the the

00:38:06.985 --> 00:38:08.787
conversation the eight from the

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:09.487
limited exposure I've had -- To

00:38:09.554 --> 00:38:11.089
the European -- Into after wind

00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:13.057
industry is the these seem to

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.926
have developed a fair amount of

00:38:14.993 --> 00:38:16.895
technology around monitoring

00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:18.997
which we could definitely use it

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:20.899
blind here [inaudible]

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:21.599
It's great.

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.234
There's been a lot of discussion

00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:25.069
about timeline throughout the

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.871
state -- That we may be seen

00:38:26.938 --> 00:38:30.742
turbines by ex date.

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:32.710
Phyllis in -- For California

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:33.278
when you think that we would

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:34.813
actually see.

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:37.115
That -- If you will.

00:38:37.182 --> 00:38:40.718
Constructing on land and

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:41.386
installing offshore what is your

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:45.156
got -- Certainly we are in the

00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:47.058
initial phase of the process we

00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:48.827
have not even identified wind

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:50.995
energy areas let alone potential

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:53.064
lease areas so we still need to

00:38:53.131 --> 00:38:54.766
environmental.

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:55.433
And that and then issue a lease

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.836
if all the planets line up and

00:38:58.903 --> 00:38:59.537
we actually had a lease sale.

00:38:59.604 --> 00:39:03.107
Mid to late twenty twenty the at

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.809
least does not guarantee or

00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:05.476
provide authorization to

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.145
construct it simply gives the

00:39:07.212 --> 00:39:09.180
let's see the ability to further

00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:10.849
characterized.

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:13.017
And the ocean and and do some

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:13.585
Mike reciting and prepares

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:14.986
engineering report.

00:39:15.053 --> 00:39:17.021
And when they have all of the

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.823
information on their facility

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.892
design in complete detail so

00:39:20.959 --> 00:39:22.827
that we can do and environmental

00:39:22.894 --> 00:39:24.762
analysis and Andy I. S. level.

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:26.865
And that's the only time and it

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:27.532
would take them a few years to

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:30.735
put that together -- And then

00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:32.737
only after approval of those

00:39:32.804 --> 00:39:33.271
plans can they begin to

00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:34.772
construct.

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.874
So -- It's a multi year process

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:38.943
if you know if we had late last

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.246
season by twenty twenty eight

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:41.913
could be.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.181
You know and don't quote me on

00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:46.818
this but twenty twenty five yeah

00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:47.518
the time frame again very rough

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:49.053
right yeah so it's it's a multi

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.721
year process and there's plenty

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:54.892
of time for engagement and you

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:55.560
know.

00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:57.295
That's a lot of things have to

00:39:57.362 --> 00:39:57.729
happen before then.

00:39:57.795 --> 00:39:58.863
Thank you.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:39:59.564
Talking about fisheries so I

00:39:59.631 --> 00:40:01.399
wanna go to the doctor there so

00:40:01.466 --> 00:40:03.368
you talked about were not even.

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.236
I'm going to paraphrase -- Were

00:40:05.303 --> 00:40:07.238
not even at the point to start

00:40:07.305 --> 00:40:10.842
talk about mitigation we are

00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:11.476
focusing on avoidance.

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.311
So when it comes to avoiding

00:40:13.378 --> 00:40:16.848
impacts when with fisheries and

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:18.850
especially how challenge

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:19.517
California fisheries have been.

00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:22.887
Over these past four years.

00:40:22.954 --> 00:40:25.089
What are you looking -- To to be

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:28.893
able to avoid those impacts.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.560
I don't think we'll be able to

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:31.296
avoid all impacts to fishing I

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:33.131
just I think everybody in this

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:34.866
room understands that's not a

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:35.533
likely.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.903
Outcome -- Given how broad on

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.905
the fishing resources are in

00:40:40.972 --> 00:40:41.539
California especially here in

00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:42.874
the north coast.

00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:43.541
So.

00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:45.243
The point what we're trying to

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:47.045
do now is gather information

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:50.848
which is a difficult task -- The

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:51.516
to give us an understanding of

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.151
where those resources are and

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:55.353
how we can minimize the impacts

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.888
of those this is.

00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:59.157
It's actually quite -- Complex

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:01.292
process we've been working with

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:03.328
local fishing organizations here

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.196
in the north coast in individual

00:41:05.263 --> 00:41:07.165
fishermen -- To develop a

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.1000
process that everybody can buy

00:41:09.067 --> 00:41:10.968
into both the agencies but and

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.870
the fishing community.

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:15.073
So that the results is -- Again

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:18.977
up process that everybody is.

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:21.145
Working together towards and the

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.081
product that everybody can buy

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.016
into and when I see a product

00:41:25.083 --> 00:41:27.018
when I mean is a discussion of

00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:27.719
what fishing resources are.

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:29.520
And then a discussion about how

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:33.024
do we cite offshore winds in

00:41:33.091 --> 00:41:33.658
these areas so that those

00:41:33.725 --> 00:41:37.095
impacts are minimized -- The

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:37.729
mitigation discussion is a

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.330
critical component of that I

00:41:39.397 --> 00:41:41.165
don't wanna make it sound like

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:42.967
we're not thinking about that

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:43.634
because we most certainly are.

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.203
But the specifics of what that

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:47.138
might look like I think it's for

00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:51.008
just that's what we're not
quite.

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:51.709
We haven't quite gone down that

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:53.311
road yet -- We're still working

00:41:53.378 --> 00:41:55.346
with the fishing communities to

00:41:55.413 --> 00:41:56.981
try to develop the impacts.

00:41:57.048 --> 00:41:58.983
So.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:00.952
It's weird missus might about --

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.954
Very rough -- And we are not

00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:04.956
holder to this time Mike right

00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:06.958
but I'm just can use an example

00:42:07.024 --> 00:42:08.960
let's just say we're looking at

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.095
putting something in in twenty

00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:12.997
twenty five just as an example.

00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:13.698
I wanna make sure that folks are

00:42:13.765 --> 00:42:15.133
leading understanding the state

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:17.135
side about the rules and

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:19.203
regulations and how that process

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.339
coincides with a hard date.

00:42:21.406 --> 00:42:24.976
After release is been issued and

00:42:25.043 --> 00:42:26.978
actually being able to see

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.013
someone bill something off
shore.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:29.680
What do folks need to know about

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:31.315
the rules the regulations and

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.050
how those would be adopted and

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:34.952
what is that process look like

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:35.253
[inaudible]

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.988
Please.

00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:39.257
I'm so I can speak to the

00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:40.958
coastal commission process --

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:41.626
And and again as I mentioned on

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.327
my side we have a regulatory

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:45.363
role here -- Especially on the

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.231
federal portions of the project

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:47.932
which is the which I think is

00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:51.269
critical -- So and that happens

00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:53.137
it to look.

00:42:53.204 --> 00:42:54.972
Two time frames the first is

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:57.175
prior to the lease sale as you
--

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.377
Heard Mr made mention -- They

00:42:59.444 --> 00:43:01.245
are going to be doing an

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:03.081
environmental analysis on prior

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:03.748
to the lease sale will be

00:43:03.815 --> 00:43:06.984
developing a documents -- But

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:07.652
before they go to the lease sale

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.353
they will submit -- A federal

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.456
consistency determination to the

00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:13.391
coastal commission at that point

00:43:13.458 --> 00:43:15.026
the calls commission will review
--

00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:17.261
The least areas of the proposed

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:20.965
lease areas and our intent at

00:43:21.032 --> 00:43:23.267
that point is to do sort of a

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.969
broad siding scale analysis

00:43:25.036 --> 00:43:29.106
about what the potential
impacts.

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:31.108
From when development would be.

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:31.676
On those from those proposed

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:33.311
lease areas -- And as I

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.113
mentioned that's an important.

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:37.148
Time for everybody here to plug

00:43:37.215 --> 00:43:39.183
into the state process -- Once

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:41.219
if we get past that phase as as

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:43.087
again we you heard there's a

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:45.089
process where the developers and

00:43:45.156 --> 00:43:45.857
collect additional data develop

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:49.160
their projects more extensively
--

00:43:49.227 --> 00:43:51.229
They will develop a plan and go

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:51.896
to them for approval of those

00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:53.564
plans those plans also need to

00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:55.099
come through the coastal

00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:55.800
commission for federal

00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:57.468
consistency review so we will be

00:43:57.535 --> 00:43:59.270
reviewing the specifics.

00:43:59.337 --> 00:44:01.072
Of now we would give me where

00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:03.074
the turbines are located and

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:03.774
what the specific we can

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.443
actually get to the nitty gritty

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.345
of an impact analysis so that's

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:09.180
the other and now is there open

00:44:09.247 --> 00:44:09.814
regulatory process in front of

00:44:09.881 --> 00:44:11.415
the coastal commission -- So

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:15.253
that's another entry from from

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.121
the federal side.

00:44:17.188 --> 00:44:19.190
There's also that initially what

00:44:19.257 --> 00:44:19.857
on it is that a parallel effort

00:44:19.924 --> 00:44:21.325
with the feds date that you

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:23.227
would be launching.

00:44:23.294 --> 00:44:25.096
Please talk yeah so it is it is

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:25.796
in partnership with the federal

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:27.231
government it's a process that's

00:44:27.298 --> 00:44:29.333
described in the coastal zone

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.369
management act and the coastal

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:33.137
commission implements that.

00:44:33.204 --> 00:44:35.106
Law for the state of California
--

00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:35.740
And so it's and this is how it

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.341
was done in the in the other

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.110
states that have done offshore

00:44:39.177 --> 00:44:39.710
wind or even offshore oil and

00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:41.112
gas so.

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:43.080
It's it is a well established

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:43.781
process will be working with the

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.483
federal government specifically

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:49.086
with bom. To make sure that we

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:49.787
get all the information we need

00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:51.355
to do that review -- When we get

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:53.090
down to the project specific

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:53.758
phase will be working with

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.293
individual projects proponents

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.428
as well -- To get all the

00:44:57.495 --> 00:45:01.265
details of the project so we can

00:45:01.332 --> 00:45:03.100
review it and of course lacked

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:03.634
[inaudible]

00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:03.901
It's great [inaudible]

00:45:03.968 --> 00:45:05.136
Spot.

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.405
I would also mention that you

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:08.072
know there's a role of course

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:09.307
for the state lands commission

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.175
in the cables that would come on

00:45:11.242 --> 00:45:11.642
shore and in you know.

00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:13.144
In.

00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:15.146
Leasing for those purposes.

00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:17.114
In the state lands commission --

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:19.116
As the authority over bay bottom

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:21.218
and leases I'm so.

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.254
So how many you a state agencies

00:45:23.321 --> 00:45:25.523
would you C. involved in the

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:29.327
permitting -- On at the state

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:29.994
level the cause commission when

00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:31.495
I have a burning action state

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:32.196
lands would likely have a

00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:37.101
permitting action -- And city of

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:37.802
CDW would have a would also

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.670
likely have a permitting action

00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:41.672
and then but that's and that's

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:43.374
for the state waters component

00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:45.443
there are potential on shore

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.411
components that than having even

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.247
broader array.

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:49.880
Of regulatory needs so for

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:51.549
looking at porn improvements

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:53.351
that brings in a whole other --

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:55.486
Set of local and state agencies

00:45:55.553 --> 00:45:57.421
and federal agencies as well

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:59.390
that will have action so -- It's

00:45:59.457 --> 00:46:01.626
a lot of folks that are going to

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:05.229
win and wait wait in on these

00:46:05.296 --> 00:46:05.730
projects.

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:07.231
Thank you this went.

00:46:07.298 --> 00:46:07.932
And while -- So some other

00:46:07.999 --> 00:46:09.600
agencies to consider while they

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:10.267
won't have a permitting role in

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:11.435
offshore wind will have --

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.471
Regulatory or an exploratory

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.339
wellness of California and the

00:46:15.406 --> 00:46:17.208
system operator as well the case

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:17.875
as well as the California public

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:19.443
utilities commission.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.612
And we have included them in our

00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:23.614
broader efforts around offshore

00:46:23.681 --> 00:46:25.249
winds.

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:27.251

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:15.352
could become the shore side hub

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:17.455
for offshore wind appointments

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:18.122

wind services and technology

00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:35.940
company that offers the floating

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.608
foundation solution to

00:49:37.675 --> 00:49:39.410
developers.

00:49:39.477 --> 00:49:40.177
I utilities and independent

00:49:40.244 --> 00:49:41.745
power producers around the world
--

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.814
And while we have established

00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:45.816
offices in Europe and are

00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:47.451
engaged in significant

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:48.118
activities in Asia.

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:49.653
The technology itself was born

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.789
here in California where were

00:49:51.856 --> 00:49:53.591
headquartered -- At one could

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:55.526
say that the technology has been

00:49:55.593 --> 00:49:57.628
raised in Europe -- Where today

00:49:57.695 --> 00:49:59.463
we have three projects totalling

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:00.097
one hundred megawatts of

00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:03.501
capacity under construction?

00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:05.669
Or a it our in advanced stages

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.471
of development -- These projects

00:50:07.538 --> 00:50:08.105
will come on line in Portugal

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:11.609
Scotland in France in twenty

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:13.544
nineteen twenty twenty and

twenty twenty one respectively
--

00:50:14.278 --> 00:50:15.913
These projects either are or

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.982
will be project financed meeting

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:19.884
that that commercial that

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.886
providers which tends to be very

00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:23.821
conservative money -- Have had

00:50:23.888 --> 00:50:25.656
their questions about technical

00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:27.458
status in performance

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:29.493
satisfactorily answered.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.127
This along with progress from

00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:31.729
other our friends in the

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:33.664
industry like Ecuador -- If I.

00:50:33.731 --> 00:50:35.533
folks have heard of Ecuador and

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:41.572
their high when technology which

00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:43.774
has deployed thirty nine what

00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:45.543
project off shore Scotland --

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.210
Demonstrates that floating wind

00:50:46.277 --> 00:50:47.478
really has arrived as a viable

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:48.112
and important opportunity to

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:49.513
meet renewable energy goals.

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.114
Indeed there are gigawatts

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.782
thousands of megawatts of

00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:53.884
projects dependent on floating

00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:55.653
when foundations under planning

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:57.688
and development around the
world.

00:50:57.755 --> 00:50:58.355
In California -- The

00:50:58.422 --> 00:50:59.790
opportunities immense projects

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:01.959
have already been proposed for

00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:03.627
the central north coast of the

00:51:03.694 --> 00:51:04.328
state.

00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:05.696
And a recent report produced by

00:51:05.763 --> 00:51:07.464
the American jobs project

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:08.132
projects the Anderson could

00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:09.900
employ over seventeen thousand

00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:11.769
people and provide close to

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.537
twenty gig watch of capacity to

00:51:13.604 --> 00:51:14.204
the grid.

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:15.639
By the twenty forties previous

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:17.474
reports from the national

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:18.142
renewable energy laboratory and

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:19.944
rail -- Have projected similar

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.845
numbers so it's clear that

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:25.482
offshore wind is a high capacity

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:26.183
product.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:27.685
Producing energy in a way and at

00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:29.553
times that is complementary to

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.488
the solar resource in the state
--

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:32.122
And that carries the potential

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:33.757
to generate significant new

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:35.726
economic activity and jobs in

00:51:35.793 --> 00:51:37.561
humble county is one of the

00:51:37.628 --> 00:51:39.863
areas that we believe could

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:40.531
benefit the most.

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:41.865
It's also an emission free and

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:42.366
environmentally friendly

00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:42.967
resource.

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:43.934
And is therefore become an

00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:45.836
important part of national

00:51:45.903 --> 00:51:47.671
planning globally. To address

00:51:47.738 --> 00:51:49.540
climate change but for

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.575
California to benefit from the

00:51:51.642 --> 00:51:52.209
tremendous promise the industry

00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:53.677
presents.

00:51:53.744 --> 00:51:54.345
There are important

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.846
considerations that should be

00:51:55.913 --> 00:51:57.681
addressed to proactively.

00:51:57.748 --> 00:51:58.349
Among the most important is the

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:59.883
interaction between floating

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.785
offshore wind farms and the

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:03.587
traditional historical and

00:52:03.654 --> 00:52:05.689
present users of the ocean
space.

00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:06.323
In many places along the

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:07.891
California coast commercial

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.994
fishing is deeply significant

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.962
from both economic and cultural

00:52:12.029 --> 00:52:12.630
perspectives.

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:13.897
The knowledge in honoring the

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:14.598
meaning for all that the free to

00:52:14.665 --> 00:52:17.668
play is of genuine importance --

00:52:17.735 --> 00:52:19.670
As new activity in the ocean are

00:52:19.737 --> 00:52:20.437
proposed.

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:21.939
And this is why principal power
--

00:52:22.006 --> 00:52:23.907
Guided by the partnership that

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.709
we have with the redwood coast

00:52:25.776 --> 00:52:27.745
energy authority RCA -- Along

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:28.445
with the D. P. R. knack for

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:31.582
solutions I prioritized aground

00:52:31.649 --> 00:52:32.116
up approach deciding our

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:33.851
proposed project here.

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:35.919
Consulting with local fishing

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:37.621
interests and other
stakeholders.

00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:39.690
And ultimately signing in M. O.

00:52:39.757 --> 00:52:40.391
U. with a humble fisheries

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:41.759
marketing association to ensure

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:44.028
that we as a project proponents

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:45.729
are held to account to the

00:52:45.796 --> 00:52:46.397
principles of collaboration that

00:52:46.463 --> 00:52:47.631
we think.

00:52:47.698 --> 00:52:49.600
Leads to better project

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:51.635
development and better outcomes.

00:52:51.702 --> 00:52:52.302
Generally.

00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:54.038
At the site that we identified

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:55.773
after consultation is about

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.775
twenty five miles off shore and

00:52:57.841 --> 00:52:58.475
just for reference.

00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:00.077
We know that other offshore wind

00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:01.712
developers in California feel

00:53:01.779 --> 00:53:03.680
and act the same way castle in

00:53:03.747 --> 00:53:05.749
for example has worked hard to

00:53:05.816 --> 00:53:06.450
build its relationship with

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:09.787
fishing interest in the Morrell

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.622
bay area.

00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:13.757
Aberration in cooperation of

00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:14.458
this nature is paramount.

00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:15.025
So California should continue to

00:53:15.092 --> 00:53:15.693
engage with stakeholders

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:17.828
invested in the ocean space.

00:53:17.895 --> 00:53:19.797
The state should seek to provide

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:21.698
developers and stakeholders with

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:22.399
as broad an array of options for

00:53:22.466 --> 00:53:24.068
development as possible so that

00:53:24.134 --> 00:53:25.636
from them.

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:27.604
The best part sites can be

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:28.238
considered and if appropriate.

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:29.640
Developed.

00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:31.809
This includes continuing

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:32.476
dialogue with the department of

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:34.144
defense for example. To pursue

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:36.113
science based analysis around

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.881
areas that should and in some

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:38.515
cases should not be open to

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:39.650
development.

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.685
This also includes analysis and

00:53:41.752 --> 00:53:43.821
action around the benefits that

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.722
avail from investments in port.

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:47.725
Or transmission infrastructure.

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.693
But because offshore wind excuse

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.795
me but because all because

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:52.396
waters off shore California.

00:53:52.463 --> 00:53:54.098
Get deep quickly floating

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:57.701
solutions are required -- These

00:53:57.768 --> 00:54:00.037
technologies advanced to the

00:54:00.104 --> 00:54:02.072
Have been removed now we need to

00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:04.007
take advantage of the sighting

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.943
flexibility floating

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:11.815
foundation's offer serve

00:54:11.882 --> 00:54:14.084
California schools. To conclude

00:54:14.151 --> 00:54:15.886
the opportunity presented

00:54:15.953 --> 00:54:16.553
California by actually does

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.188
large so are the challenges to

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:19.990
maximize the industry's

00:54:20.057 --> 00:54:21.992
potential and the benefits that

00:54:22.059 --> 00:54:22.626
it can provide to the state and

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:23.727
nation.

00:54:23.794 --> 00:54:25.796
The urgency to address these

00:54:25.863 --> 00:54:27.765
issues is also large and we

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:29.900
stand ready to assess. Two is to

00:54:29.967 --> 00:54:30.601
assist the committee in its

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:33.704
deliberations -- And to provide

00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:35.773
other information very happy to

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:36.473
participate in a question answer

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.808
period after my testimony thank

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:44.047
hold questions until each of our

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:45.883
presenters were very grateful

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:47.718
for the here we want to say

00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:48.418
thank you so much Mister Severi

who's a senior research engineer

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.889
at charts energy research
center.

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.957
But he really has been here on

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:55.726
the ground working it -- In

00:54:55.793 --> 00:54:57.728
working with the state on all

00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.963
issues -- Avoids how we can

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.065
avoid impacts to the environment

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.934
wildlife and fisheries ring turn

00:55:04.001 --> 00:55:07.971
for over to you Sir we welcome

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:08.605

appreciate the opportunity to

00:55:11.842 --> 00:55:15.712
ask by the testimony today -- So

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:16.380
I believe I have a presentation

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:19.716
all just let that come up --

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:20.317
After one complaint important

00:55:20.384 --> 00:55:22.219
part in California's clean

00:55:22.286 --> 00:55:23.954
energy future and can help meet

00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:24.655
this help the state meet its

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.156
target of a 100% clean renewable

00:55:26.223 --> 00:55:27.758
energy.

00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:29.760

resource in California and in

00:55:31.862 --> 00:55:32.462
particular on the north coast is

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:33.931
one of the best in the

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:34.498
continental US.

00:55:34.565 --> 00:55:35.866
With average wind speeds

00:55:35.933 --> 00:55:38.101
exceeding ten meters per second

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.770
in some locations.

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:40.470
California's north north coast

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.072
has a strong opportunity proffer

00:55:42.139 --> 00:55:43.774
when development.

00:55:43.841 --> 00:55:45.776
Because of the support Sir

infrastructure in Humboldt Bay

00:55:50.414 --> 00:55:51.882
and limited overlap with US

00:55:51.949 --> 00:55:53.750
military operations.

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:55.919
However there are several

00:55:55.986 --> 00:55:56.486
challenges to development.

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:58.055
These include electric

00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.957
transmission constraints part of

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:01.925
the structure requirements.

00:56:01.992 --> 00:56:03.827
Stapler concerns environmental

00:56:03.894 --> 00:56:04.494
impacts.

research center at Humboldt

00:56:14.238 --> 00:56:16.106
state university is working on

00:56:16.173 --> 00:56:17.841
feasibility analysis to quantify

00:56:17.908 --> 00:56:18.508
the opportunities for energy and

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:20.077
economic development.

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:21.979
And also understand the

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:22.579
challenges impacts and

constraints of officer one

00:56:24.181 --> 00:56:27.951
development on the north coast.

00:56:28.018 --> 00:56:31.855
Next slide please.

00:56:31.922 --> 00:56:32.556
At the start center we're

00:56:32.623 --> 00:56:33.190
working on three projects one of

00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:34.091
which is been funded and the

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:36.059
other two have been proposed and

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:37.861
are pending funds.

00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:39.997
The products -- Over one your

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:40.564
time line -- Beginning this

00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:41.865
spring.

00:56:41.932 --> 00:56:42.466
Results and outcomes will be

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:44.101
disseminated by winter and

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:46.169
spring of twenty twenty I'll

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:48.071
briefly describe the scope and

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:49.940
status of each of the three

00:56:50.007 --> 00:56:51.875
project proposals.

00:56:51.942 --> 00:56:52.576
The first project looks at the

00:56:52.643 --> 00:56:55.846
when resource generation profile

00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:57.848
and transmission constraints

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.515
this project has been proposed

00:56:58.582 --> 00:56:59.082
to the bureau of ocean energy

00:56:59.149 --> 00:56:59.883
management.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.052
As pending funding the product

00:57:02.119 --> 00:57:03.954
will look at the following tasks

00:57:04.021 --> 00:57:05.889
first.

00:57:05.956 --> 00:57:06.590
The resource assessment will be

00:57:06.657 --> 00:57:08.325
used to evaluate the wind speed

00:57:08.392 --> 00:57:10.127
resource and calculate the

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:11.828
potential energy generation

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:12.529
profile from different wind farm

00:57:12.596 --> 00:57:14.231
scales locations on the north

00:57:14.298 --> 00:57:14.898
coast.

00:57:14.965 --> 00:57:16.266
Second we'll be looking at the

00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:18.268
great compatibility which will

00:57:18.335 --> 00:57:20.137
evaluate the like trickle

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:22.039
transmission capacity to connect

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:23.840
offshore wind into the regional

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:24.508
grad.

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:25.976
Transmission capacity is very

00:57:26.043 --> 00:57:26.677
limited and I'm all county and

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:29.846
significant upgrades will likely

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:30.447
be required props or when

00:57:30.514 --> 00:57:32.149
development this task will

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:32.816
partner with.

00:57:38.055 --> 00:57:38.555
flow transmission model and

00:57:38.622 --> 00:57:40.090
estimate the required

00:57:40.157 --> 00:57:41.858
infrastructure upgrade classic

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:44.261
costs. For different one farm

00:57:44.328 --> 00:57:45.896
scales.

00:57:45.963 --> 00:57:48.131
Next this project will be

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:50.100
looking at the ad -- Subsea

00:57:50.167 --> 00:57:52.035
cable. To determine the options

00:57:52.102 --> 00:57:52.669
and feasibility first I've C.

00:57:52.736 --> 00:57:54.237
cable to transmit power from

00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:56.039
let's centers -- From from wind

00:57:56.106 --> 00:57:58.175
farms and on the north coast to

00:57:58.241 --> 00:57:58.842
Los centers in the San Francisco

00:57:58.909 --> 00:58:01.979
Bay Area -- Lastly we'll.

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:04.281
Conduct an economic analysis to

00:58:04.348 --> 00:58:06.283
develop a bottom up cost model

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:08.185
to calculate the cost for

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:12.022
offshore wind energy for

00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:12.656
different development skills in

00:58:12.723 --> 00:58:14.057
this region.

00:58:14.124 --> 00:58:14.658
Next there is a project that

00:58:14.725 --> 00:58:15.959
evaluates the concerns

00:58:16.026 --> 00:58:16.593
surrounding offshore wind

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.261

anchoring and in particular bill

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:22.252
also look at the issues with

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.087
horizontal directional drilling

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:26.189
for cable and fall into the bay.

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:26.823
Lastly there will be -- Subsea

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:28.492
cable environmental analysis

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:30.627
which will conduct a preliminary

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:32.429
environment out of my mental

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:34.331
analysis of a sub C.

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.031

a ouija is the US trade

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.078
association that represents the

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:58.415
wind industry -- And our member

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:00.383
companies are global leaders in

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.419
utility scale wind energy

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.053
technologies were interested in

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.487
delivering the benefits of

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.656
utility scale wins both onshore.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.260
And offshore to Californians --

01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:12.262
American when power was born in

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:14.531
California roughly around the

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.466
same years me -- And after wind

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:20.270
energy is the future -- We I.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:20.971
Californian our member companies

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:22.572
are applying the lessons that we

01:02:22.639 --> 01:02:24.207
learned from our experiences

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:26.443
with lance bass wind -- As well

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.378
as our experiences on the east

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:30.313
coast with offshore winds. To

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.349
the California market to make

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.217
sure that California after wind

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:34.884
starts off on the right foot --

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.720
And in a manner that maximizes

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:40.590
the value that it brings to

01:02:40.657 --> 01:02:42.225
California.

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.194
At one of those lessons is that

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:44.728
it's really critical to

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.296
collaborate early with

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:48.298
environmental and other

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.200
stakeholders -- And often

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:50.867
throughout the process of

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:52.535
development -- And it's clear

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.404
that officer wind energy is

01:02:54.471 --> 01:02:55.038
coming to California companies

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.640
are hiring and watching the

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.441
market for signals of stability

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:00.243
and opportunities for growth.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.278
That opportunity is enormous --

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.414
Kevin mentioned the the job

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:06.483
study that -- Explained that

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.618
over seventeen thousand jobs

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:10.220
could come to California -- If

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:10.820
we maximize the potential

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:12.455
opportunity and see about

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.424
eighteen gigawatts of

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.226
development off the coast that's

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:18.461
an enormous number and if we're

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:20.296
going to get to a significant --

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:22.432
Market like that we need to make

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:23.133
sure that every step of the way

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:24.501
we're checking in with critical

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:26.369
stakeholders we'll be

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:27.037
interacting with these projects

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:28.471
on a day to day basis -- So we

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.807
have to start with the best

01:03:30.874 --> 01:03:32.509
projects in the best places and

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:34.411
make sure that we get it right

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.045
with our eyes and scaling up.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.613
After wind has potential to

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.715
revitalize port communities like

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:40.550
Eureka -- And to bring

01:03:40.617 --> 01:03:42.419
manufacturing to the stake state

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:43.053
and California is very well

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.654
positioned to tap into that

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:46.589
potential -- Given the 1100%

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.491
clean energy policies that we

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:50.627
have -- And our carbon neutral

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:52.262
goal.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:54.331
On the east coast after wind

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.031
continues to advance advance --

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:58.401
Improving economies and through

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:00.336
robust strict state policies

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:01.004
that have recently been signed

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.505
into law by a bipartisan group

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.341
of governors so.

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:05.041
Leaders in Massachusetts Rhode

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:06.743
Island Connecticut New York New

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:08.712
Jersey and Maryland have all

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.814
made and Virginia also have all

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.582
made very substantial offshore

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:14.351
wind commitments.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.386
And we expect offshore wind to

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:18.488
continue to mirror they M. Costa

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:24.327
claims that we've seen with land

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:24.861
based went throughout the

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:26.363
country.

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:26.930
We know that after winds can

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.565
complement California's

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.199
generation and low profile so

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.667
Kevin also mentions a as did

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:32.469
look plan I believe the the

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.136
complementary nature between

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:34.804
wind and solar in the state so

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.539
as we move. To higher

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.708
penetrations of renewable energy
--

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:40.777
We know that the seller is very

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:42.479
predictable it comes off line

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.514
around. Six o'clock PM roughly

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.383
when the sun is setting that is

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:47.050
exactly the time where offshore

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:48.752
wind resources are ramping up

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:50.553
and started to pull the hardest.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.555
Those resources can continue to

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:53.189
blow throughout the throughout

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:54.591
the evening and through the

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.793
night which can help us charge

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.595
our electric vehicle fleets

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.363
California also has very.

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.332
Aggressive -- Electrification

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:03.032
targets and can also help with

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.701
night time heating loads in the

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:06.669
building and industry sector.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.405
So there's enormous pop

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:12.709
opportunity for D. carbonization

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:14.711
her as well -- We also know the

01:05:14.778 --> 01:05:16.346
officer wind can have a capacity

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:18.348
factor between sixty and 70%

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:18.915
based on what we've seen in

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:20.383
European markets.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.452
Roughly what that means is that

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:24.687
you see -- Just as a sense of

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.623
scale coal and natural gas have

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:30.393
capacity factors of 5455% --

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.529
Throughout the US so essentially

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.330
officer wind will be generating

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.466
more of the time and some of

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:37.100
those conventional resources it

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:38.668
can have enormous D.

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:44.407
carbonization benefits -- And we

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:46.342
know that it's also -- It's also

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.010
I'm going to bring those jobs to

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:48.378
the state as well.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.413
But in order to get there we

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.080
know that collaboration is going

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:52.448
to be key so I'm gonna talk

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:53.016
about three different areas

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.384
where.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.084
We is collaborating and

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.553
individual companies as well --

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:58.655
To make sure that we're doing

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.557
this responsibly.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.492
The officer winds industry we

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:03.159
know and through the work that

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:04.861
we've done with the department

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:06.729
of defense can enhance national

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:07.430
security.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:08.965
And is compatible with military

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:10.733
operations and readiness -- We

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.735
know that adding energy a

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.571
pendant independence in an

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.573
office or a home grown energy

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:17.273
source like off her wins.

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.975
Can help reduce our reliance on

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:20.777
foreign energy sources and

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:22.679
enhance our national security --

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.714
And and we've seen this

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:26.549
undulating bayside -- We're

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:27.183
ready to work with the

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:27.784
department of defense we're

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:28.818
doing so in Washington DC

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:30.820
include as well as the Coast

01:06:30.887 --> 01:06:32.622
Guard and the navy -- We're

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:36.726
finding workable project citing

01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:38.828
locations -- We also know that

01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:39.462
we can co exist with the

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.196
commercial and recreational

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:42.465
fishing industries and diverse
--

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:43.166
Diversify and strength in the U.

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:44.801
S. maritime economy we're seeing

01:06:44.868 --> 01:06:46.569
that through individual company

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:48.438
efforts like what Kevin

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.506
mentioned -- And engaging as

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:51.140
well and some of the ongoing

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.642
studies that are happening.

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:56.513
With the offshore projects on

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.448
the east coast like block island

01:06:58.515 --> 01:06:59.115
[inaudible] Thirty second.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:00.917
And we've also learned a great

01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:02.785
deal from our work with the

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.454
environmental groups who within

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:05.121
we partner on the American wind

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:08.458
and wildlife institute -- This

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:09.025
is a partnership of industry

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:10.526
leaders agencies and

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:11.160
conservation groups that work

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:12.695
together to insure and

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.664
facilitate the timely

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:16.499
development renewable energy.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.835
Excuse me at develop -- Projects

01:07:18.902 --> 01:07:22.438
responsibly without affecting

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:24.474
wildlife with habitat.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.543
Excuse my voice -- So in

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.444
conclusion -- We're really

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:29.078
grateful for this I think we

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:30.780
have seen that California is

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:32.448
already following best practices

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:33.149
by having this meeting relief

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:34.918
there no projects online we have

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:36.719
a really great chance to get

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.588
this right.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:39.188
And we look forward to working

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:39.822
with you in the future.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:41.024
Thank you so much miss bills

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.525
were very grateful into our

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:45.061
panel I would like to be a sort

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:46.529
of a some questions -- First of

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:47.230
all I would like to be able to

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:50.700
go -- To the shots energy center

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:51.100
for so [inaudible]

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:52.669
Talk about.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.771
In your beliefs so there's been

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:58.641
some discussion about ten when
--

01:07:58.708 --> 01:07:59.208
Turbines off of the humble

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:00.677
coaxed.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.712
So what type of upgrades you see

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:04.914
may be needed if you can just

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:06.582
walk us through that.

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.818
In how many megawatts would that

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:09.519
be is at a hundred make watch

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:10.954
just just give us a an overview

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.889
if you don't mind -- Yes so if

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:14.891
there were ten megawatts of a

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:16.759
typical sized -- People are

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.695
looking at is maybe ten to

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:19.362
twelve megawatts per turbine so

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:22.699
that would be around a hundred

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:23.366
two hundred twenty megawatts for

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:26.736
for that particular farm -- As

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:29.172
Daniel mention with a sixty or

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.773
70% capacity factor they'll be

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.777
producing out most -- We'll need

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:35.511
to get the details about how

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.080
much energy the precinct I
guess.

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.781
Will be required in several

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.817
places not only the port but

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.552
also in particular transmission

01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:44.654
upgrades I don't believe that

01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:45.288
humble county is great has the

01:08:45.355 --> 01:08:46.756
capacity to absorb.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:50.660
A hundred or even fifty

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:51.294
additional megawatts of

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:54.664
electricity -- Right now so

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:55.365
significant upgrades will be

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:58.568
required either in that overland

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.637
transmission lines going east to

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:01.304
the to the interstate five

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:03.039
corridor or potentially going

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:04.607
south.

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:05.274
Along existing utility right

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.976
away as so will be significant

01:09:07.043 --> 01:09:08.811
electricity transmission

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:09.445
upgrades but then also

01:09:09.512 --> 01:09:10.880
significant part development

01:09:10.947 --> 01:09:12.782
will be required both -- To due

01:09:12.849 --> 01:09:14.884
the assembly but also on going

01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:16.653
on operations and maintenance of

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.621
the of the Germans.

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.890
So since every or an expansion

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:22.759
so have how has that price break

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.594
down.

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.294
Or in the investment break down
--

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:28.631
Happened in other regions so can

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.833
you give us -- In rural areas

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.969
whether it's on the east coast

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:34.771
or internationally -- That we

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.839
need to be able to increase the

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.908
capacity for transmission.

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:42.578
How was that -- Investment

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:46.682
breakdown taken hold.

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.618
Who pays for it?

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:49.318
What's a good question -- And

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:50.987
certainly it's it's relevant to

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.822
offer when developing in

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:54.624
California -- All right.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.093
As well as I'd certainly implied

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.895
anyway in the and by the

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.797
previous panel -- It is done

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:01.464
differently in different places

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:04.901
and where we've seen offshore

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:06.703
wind take hold.

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.771
Sort of first -- Really in

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.740
northern Europe so maybe and you

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.775
know Denmark and the Netherlands

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:14.711
and even in the U. K. Germany.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:16.979
In these places generally what's

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.815
happened is that at the central

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.917
government has -- Has actually

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:22.985
provided access to transition to

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.054
the project developer and that's

01:10:25.121 --> 01:10:26.789
the and it's incorporated it's

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:27.490
not a part of what that what

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:30.693
they what the what the developer

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.394
including the cost that the

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:33.129
consumer sees for those projects

01:10:33.196 --> 01:10:34.730
so it's something that.

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:36.699
Obviously it's seen either

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:37.366
through taxes or through through

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:38.968
a like a feed in tariff type

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:41.003
arrangement but so the developer

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.872
it's taken care of by by

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:44.707
somebody else.

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:46.809
So transmission or denies or for

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:47.477
example sure signs can

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:49.011
paraphrase here so let's just

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:50.880
say we're gonna have -- Ten off

01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:52.882
the humble cooks -- Again just

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:54.684
I. prophetical ten off the the

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:55.284
coast hundred hundred twenty

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:56.719
make a whites.

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:58.755
It may be in the hundreds of

01:10:58.821 --> 01:10:59.388
millions of dollars to be able

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:00.990
to create it to be able to

01:11:01.057 --> 01:11:01.524
expand.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.025
The capacity for those

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:06.696
transmission lines in some areas

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:07.396
in northern Europe.

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.132
The the government has paid for

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:10.967
the upgrade of transmission

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:14.704
lines while the private industry
--

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.773
Contractor has installed the

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:19.142
turbine turbines and the cantor

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.910
cables is that accurate.

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:28.718
I'm oversimplifying yeah yeah.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:29.385
You know I think from our

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:30.787
perspective we think that sent

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:31.454
for the project here and humbled

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:32.155
we think that -- There may be

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:32.922
some ways that we can avoid the

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:33.623
major upgrades -- That would

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.158
result in a you know in addition

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:36.692
to hundreds of millions of

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.694
dollars of costs for an initial

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:42.698
project -- I think you fear

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:43.399
summarize that situation well

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.168
though yeah do you want to talk

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.069
about those about some ways to

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.038
be able to mitigate that the

01:11:49.105 --> 01:11:50.873
cost C. if you don't mind --

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.142
Well for I I'm not really

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:54.811
qualified to talk about sort of

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:55.511
the transmission sort of wrap

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:57.113
around that we might be able to

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.815
achieve here and I. in humble

01:11:58.881 --> 01:11:59.448
county transmission as you may

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.917
know is it.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:01.617
Like an almost impossibly

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:10.793
complex -- Area -- Seven that's

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:11.494
that that's that's just tough

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:12.195
one for me I'm gonna add that as

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.229
a follow up okay so will -- Talk

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:14.997
about [inaudible]

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:15.431
Lessons learned.

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:16.833
Internationally.

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:19.068
So we're asking the last panel

01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:20.803
about lessons learned especially

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:21.437
when it comes to fisheries and

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:22.838
the environment.

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:25.241
So what we what measures have

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:27.109
been deployed by both private

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.145
industry as well as government

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:32.815
to be able -- To have compatible

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:33.482
uses.

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.084
Allow the fleet to continue to

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:37.119
operate as well as have the

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:40.790
renewable energy can either

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.825
three of you talk about that
all.

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:44.827
Not all at once.

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:45.461
I don't have the I don't have

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:46.896
the global perspective from

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.798
Europe I think -- California has

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:49.498
had a lot of experiences the

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:51.234
previous panel explained with --

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.202
You know making sure that we're

01:12:53.269 --> 01:12:55.037
minimizing impacts for a variety

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.806
of different technologies and

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:57.473
been doing it for hydro power

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.175
for a long time so there are a

01:12:59.242 --> 01:12:59.809
lot of different lessons that we

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:00.843
can use.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:01.477
And apply from other

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:03.112
technologies as well that is

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:05.047
other parts of the country but I

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.882
don't have the information on

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:07.516
environmental issues globally.

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:08.818
Thank you can follow

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:09.518
[inaudible]

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:12.889
Please -- I I also have more of

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:15.024
a a local focus here but I think

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:16.926
I'd say that one thing -- That

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:19.295
that could be a lesson learned

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:21.030
from the east coast is states

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:24.834
setting -- Targets for offshore

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.869
wind development helps give the

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.804
industry both a vision of how

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:29.472
they're moving forward but also

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:32.875
give the state some ability to

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:33.542
plan ahead a probe really ball

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:35.044
for transmission but also for

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:37.013
environmental concerns.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:39.081
The environmental studies.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:43.019
The enviro study that you're

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:43.619
dancing now shots [inaudible]

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:44.854
How?

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.889
How will be able to overlap for

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:49.058
example the central coast or is

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:49.692
it?

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:53.162
More just focus on the north

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.829
coast fill us in on that.

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:54.931
This will also be very focused

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:55.598
on the north coast we're gonna

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:57.133
be looking specifically at two

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:59.235
separate areas one of those is

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.137
the bomb call area and one of

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:01.771
them is further south of Cape

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:03.272
Mendocino that I was really

01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:04.974
super wind speeds.

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.009
Within that area and and just

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:07.677
around that we're gonna be

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.078
looking at population seasonal

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:11.113
patterns of migration what type

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.249
of birds fish marine mammals are

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:14.984
there and these are gonna be

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:17.219
very specific to the region and

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.055
the unique -- Ecosystems we have

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.090
up here so I think maybe some of

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:23.025
the results and methods maybe

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:25.161
transferable to different

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:25.828
regions but I think it to be

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:28.931
very focused on understanding

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:30.967
one of the potential impacts.

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:33.069
The other two cities have yet to

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:33.769
be funded let's just say you

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:35.104
kick off tomorrow are you today

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:35.771
talking twelve twenty four

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.273
months how long would it take

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.975
you D. thing to be a complete.

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:39.608
These are all twelve month

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:41.243
projects -- We're hoping and

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.245
expecting that -- The other two

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.047
will be beginning within a month

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:47.350
or two and we still expect -- Be

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:51.153
heading deadline so five next

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.389
spring or for results yeah

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:54.924
reports in would you describe

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.926
the studies as initial -- Or you

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:57.626
will you need to be able to go

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:59.395
back to be to do further review

01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:01.364
after what you find from this

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.265
these studies that you're

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.967
launching now.

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:07.136
I think different tasks have

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:09.071
will have different levels of

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:11.040
detail so for example when we're

01:15:11.107 --> 01:15:11.674
looking at a subsea cable for

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:13.175
long distance transmission

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:13.876
that's gonna be a very high

01:15:13.943 --> 01:15:15.411
level because it's a preliminary

01:15:15.478 --> 01:15:17.213
thing nothing similar it's been

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:17.880
done on the west coast.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:19.281
But other aspects of the study

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.150
such as the transmission.

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:23.219
Integration will be will be

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:25.521
detailed and be pretty -- Final.

01:15:25.588 --> 01:15:31.060
What was that hi aspect about?

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:31.727
Would like to be to just talk

01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:33.529
about -- The floating turbines

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:34.163
can you just.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.464
Give us thirty thousand foot

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:39.201
view of what the time line for

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.170
construction is off shore -- In

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:43.339
what that would look like this

01:15:43.406 --> 01:15:44.006
so that we have a a visual

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:45.441
leaving here today -- I don't

01:15:45.508 --> 01:15:47.076
know if.

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:49.145
Every Mister Bannister yeah sure

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:49.845
it M. and an old also just give

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.247
a quick description of what our

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:51.881
technology looks like just just

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:53.416
to help people visualize so

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:59.321
basically -- Our technology

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.056
recalled the wind flowed there

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:01.690
are three columns that and if

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:03.059
you look at it from above

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:03.692
effectively form any collateral

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:07.196
triangle -- I just circular

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:09.365
columns -- Upon one of those

01:16:09.432 --> 01:16:11.434
columns we have fixed the wind

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.202
turbine and the ideas that we

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:15.137
fix the wind turbine in a

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:15.805
protected environment.

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.306
Of the harbor and then we tow

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:19.475
out that fully assembled unit to

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:21.343
the project site and at the

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.212
project site we would have pre

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:25.114
deployed -- The mooring and

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:27.049
what's called the export cable

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:27.650
so the cable that actually

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:29.418
brings the power to shore.

01:16:29.485 --> 01:16:31.520
I saw the operation is what

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.322
happens all at shore with the

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.191
exception of the toe out.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.326
And then the connection of the

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:39.061
mooring lines of the cables so

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:41.063
each of these systems will have

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:43.065
one morning line that extends

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:45.067
off of each of the column so

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:47.102
total of three mooring lines --

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:49.171
For each wind turbine -- The

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:53.209
foundation itself -- Our team

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.344
has a from sometime ago has

01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:57.213
history in oil and gas -- That

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.181
the foundation is called a semi

01:16:59.248 --> 01:16:59.882
submersible that's that's sort

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:03.085
of the type of foundation it is.

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:05.187
This type of foundation I'm has

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:05.888
been deployed in places like the

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:07.656
Gulf of Mexico and in the North

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:09.325
Sea for decades and decades so

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:11.160
there's a lot of experience with

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:11.861
this type of foundation.

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:13.429
What we're talking about is much

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:15.397
much smaller than this sort of

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.366
the Gulf of Mexico you know

01:17:17.433 --> 01:17:19.201
enormous like oil?

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:23.239
Type of type of systems -- So

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.374
the construction window -- Can

01:17:25.441 --> 01:17:27.309
be fairly compressed -- Because

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:29.512
we're not reliance on heavy lift

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.480
operations offshore like you

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:35.251
would see -- For what we would

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:35.885
call a conventional or bottom

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.653
fixed offshore wind project

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.188
where.

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:39.889
You know you have a foundation

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.557
you pile it into the C. bad and

01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:43.559
then you bring out the whole you

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:45.561
know that on a on a vessel you

01:17:45.628 --> 01:17:47.196
bring out.

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:47.897
The tower than a cell the blades

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.465
then you have to lift that all

01:17:49.532 --> 01:17:51.534
the way up to what's called the

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.168
hub height which may be.

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:53.502
You know three hundred three

01:17:53.569 --> 01:18:01.243
hundred fifty feet above the sea

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.245
surface we do all that work at

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:03.846
shore so the offshore works.

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:04.547
Are much much simpler with

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:05.614
flooding systems like ours so it

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.383
hundred megawatt projects.

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:09.185
That's you know it is confined

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:09.885
to some to the to open whether

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:11.287
windows we it's difficult can be

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:12.054
difficult to be out there in

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:13.355
January doing this type of work
--

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:17.326
But in the you know scholars

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.328
from April through October --

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:21.564
Depending on the consultations

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:23.599
that we have with especially the

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:25.467
environmental at stake holders

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.269
and also fishing interests what

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:29.338
times are open for those types

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:29.972
of activities.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.307
It would take two seasons I

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.342
would imagine -- So you know

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:35.411
maybe one summer then another

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:37.346
summer to deploy the full. One

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:39.348
hundred megawatts -- I think you

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:41.250
as the industry matures here in

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:41.951
California that will be

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:43.552
compressed further as we all you

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:47.456
know we learn from learn by

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:49.358
doing and get better at it.

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:51.627
Got it in you talked about jobs

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:53.262
talk with us about permanent

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.230
jobs one time our temper if you

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:55.864
will in the construction phase

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:56.532
so.

01:18:56.599 --> 01:18:57.700
Go through that if you if you

01:18:57.766 --> 01:19:01.437
don't mind Spencer -- Certainly

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.372
there construction phase jobs

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:04.039
and then there's I went M. at

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:05.741
jobs -- Which are for you know

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:06.408
for the life of the project and

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:07.776
I think one of the things that

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:09.511
is quite compelling we're seeing

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.547
it now in the on shore -- Wind

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:13.749
world where a lot of that the

01:19:13.816 --> 01:19:15.818
turbines and towers that are you

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.453
know placed on shore now being

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.321
recommissioned in repowered.

01:19:19.388 --> 01:19:21.357
And with floating -- Foundation

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:21.991
technologies like ours that

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.592
opportunity exists to do the

01:19:23.659 --> 01:19:25.527
same so maybe a project has a

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:26.228
twenty or twenty five your life.

01:19:26.295 --> 01:19:27.730
You can tell the foundation back

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.331
to shore.

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:31.300
Replace the turbine the turbine

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:31.934
in this case is the sensitive

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:33.769
piece of equipment that has

01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:35.304
shorter life.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:35.938
Then the foundation itself so

01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:37.506
there is there is the

01:19:37.573 --> 01:19:39.541
opportunity not to for that for

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.343
that sort of one time work of of

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:43.345
construction the ongoing work of

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:44.079
operation and maintenance and

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.314
then there will be
opportunities.

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:47.650
For we think for re powering --

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:51.287
Existing projects but we also

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:51.954
see that the opportunity in

01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:53.656
California so large when we're

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:55.324
talking about twenty gigawatts.

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:57.426
By the twenty forties twenty

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:59.561
forties is only twenty you know

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.262
twenty something years from now
--

01:20:00.329 --> 01:20:01.597
That is that that's a lot of

01:20:01.664 --> 01:20:03.332
work to be done.

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:05.367
So they may be one time jobs ask

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:07.569
for a particular project but we

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.538
do use to see the potential --

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:15.344
For projects to be developed in

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:15.878
ultimately constructed in

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.313
parallel.

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:19.315
Thank you so much miss mills.

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:19.948
We have seen this on León bay

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:20.516
side as well there right now

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:21.283
thirteen manufacturing

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.884
facilities in California that

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:22.518
support.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:23.619
Land based wind -- And wind

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:25.454
turbine technician training

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:27.356
programs within the state that
--

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:29.291
You know that go out and service

01:20:29.358 --> 01:20:31.460
turbines throughout the country
--

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.462
So if we see you know a robust

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:35.364
wind resource in New Mexico or

01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:35.998
Wyoming they can go there you

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:37.733
can do the same thing with

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.401
offshore winds -- There's also

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:41.370
you know I think this is why --

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.572
Keeping our eyes on a a larger

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:45.441
target is really helpful because

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.409
that's what will actually bring

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:49.311
the supply chain into California

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:51.413
earlier in the process so that

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.081
we can get some of these parts.

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:53.615
Manufactured in California and

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.851
then you know if we get to a

01:20:55.918 --> 01:20:57.419
point where there's additional

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:58.053
development throughout the

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.421
Pacific be exporting some of

01:20:59.488 --> 01:21:01.690
those parts -- Throughout.

01:21:01.757 --> 01:21:03.425
The world.

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:04.126
Thank you so much would like to

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:05.861
be to see if there's any closing

01:21:05.928 --> 01:21:07.396
comments and I like to be added

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:08.063
to our follow ups as well

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:09.665
including comments for either

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:10.365
the three of you will start with

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:13.836
miss mills and work our way to

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.437
the left.

01:21:15.504 --> 01:21:17.473
Since no I just I encourage you

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:18.107
to continue to lean on us as a

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:18.707
resource and we'd like to

01:21:18.774 --> 01:21:19.742
interact with a lot of the

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:20.442
important stake holders who are

01:21:20.509 --> 01:21:21.744
here today and moving forward to

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.445
make sure that we do this right.

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:24.012
Thank you thank you so much

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.447
suffering.

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:26.148
I look for the opportunity to

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.783
present some of our result after

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:29.551
we've gotten into the studies

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:31.487
will but further every great you

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:32.020
have as four think so much

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:32.721
Spanish.

01:21:32.788 --> 01:21:33.856
I would just say that there are

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.758
several lessons that we are

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.659
bringing from Europe -- Some of

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.795
them are you kind of down in the

01:21:39.862 --> 01:21:41.830
details you know at the things

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.732
about cable protection systems

01:21:43.799 --> 01:21:45.734
that -- That will make the

01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:47.503
cables last one which means that

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:48.103
you have to deploy them less

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:48.670
frequently.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:49.705
I would say the floating

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:51.573
foundations themselves in some

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.509
ways our lesson learned from

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.410
Europe -- We C. significantly

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:57.679
reduced risk -- And in fact so

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.548
significantly reduced

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:00.315
environmental impact when using

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:03.852
floating foundation so we
deploy.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:05.587
Pretty conventional offshore

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:06.255
anchors that are entirely

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.723
removable as opposed to doing

01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:09.858
piling into the C. bad which not

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.794
entirely but is a very pretty

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.462
pretty common practice.

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:15.697
For the bottom six foundations

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.466
and we know that.

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:18.167
Those you know that since severe

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:19.668
sort of acoustic signature that

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:21.537
comes with that piling is really

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:22.204
detrimental for marine mammals

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:25.407
in particular so with floating

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:26.041
foundations there's there's you

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:27.776
know less impact in the

01:22:27.843 --> 01:22:29.711
deployment and installation

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:30.379
phase.

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:31.647
And then perhaps the greatest

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:32.347
benefit there's been a lot of

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:33.816
discussion about where we are in

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.784
this part in this practice now

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:37.753
is avoidance you know trying to

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.353
avoid harm.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.788
Flown foundations give you

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.623
greater opportunity to do that

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:43.559
because you can't.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:44.226
You're not dependent so much on

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:45.928
what the C. bad conditions are

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.729
or how deep the water is you can

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.698
go to the place where first

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:51.567
maybe where the wind is good.

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:52.234
But also maybe the first place

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:53.902
that you go is where you know

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.938
the a variety of stakeholders

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:57.673
say this is where we think you

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:58.373
should go in the wind resources

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.908
sufficient to enable an economic

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:01.910
projects so it provides.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.712
A tremendous amount of

01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:07.850
flexibility that that's really

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.551
valuable.

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:10.252
Andy so much really appreciate

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:11.620

environmental perspective.

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:25.801
Our next panel is title

01:23:25.868 --> 01:23:27.536
protecting our ocean environment

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:28.170
in balancing the need for green

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:29.872
energy perspectives from

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.673
environmental leaders we are

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.542
grateful that we're gonna have

hard to carbon energy sources

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:54.423
when being one sold beer not

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:55.824

migration and pollute water

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:05.767
pollution.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.970
So we're not not considering

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:08.670
that all.

01:25:23.919 --> 01:25:25.821
ecosystems on our local national

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:27.689
and global scale.

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:29.725
And protect the biotic and

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:30.325
abiotic components of local

national.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.664
And global natural systems --

01:25:35.731 --> 01:25:37.1000
Scope of our chapter covers all

county of medicine -- County and

01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:49.645
western Trinity county --

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:51.747
Personally I graduated from

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.815
mobile C. numbers in nineteen

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:54.516
seventy with a degree in
biology.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:56.118
And after graduation went to

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:57.919
work for the for service in

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.855
southern California -- Working

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:01.723
in fire control and then and

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:05.660
prescribed burning research --

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:06.361
With the experiment station down

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:15.871
in Glendora -- After a four year

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:17.939
stint with the US army at the

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.675
Walter Reed army institute of

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:21.710
research in Washington DC.

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:22.411
I returned back up normal state

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:23.979
university because is a good

01:26:24.046 --> 01:26:27.916
place to raise a to this area to

01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:29.818
raise a family where I I began

01:26:29.885 --> 01:26:30.485
working for read the sciences

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:32.254
lab on there -- Actually first

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.122
on a silviculture project which

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.690
got disbanded.

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:38.060
And then -- Millie picked up by

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:41.663
a wildlife project -- In

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:42.297
nineteen eighty three and ever

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:44.132
since nineteen eighty three

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:45.867
until my retirement.

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:46.501
Two thousand eleven I worked as

01:26:46.568 --> 01:26:53.842
a as a wildlife biologist --

01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:54.443
I've been involved with them

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:59.781
with the Audubon since --

01:26:59.848 --> 01:27:00.382
Nineteen nineteen eighty seven

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:02.184
in nineteen ninety eight a

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:04.052
spirited effort. To get Hubble

01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:05.821
they complex.

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:08.023
Included in the western hills

01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:09.791
for shore bird reserve network.

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:13.962
And that was as a intern as a

01:27:14.029 --> 01:27:14.629
almost as an international site.

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:16.064
And that was just recently

01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:19.868
upgrade this year. To a

01:27:19.935 --> 01:27:26.007
hemispheric side -- Very little

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.943
is known about the bird

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:28.643
component do we have off shore

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:33.849
out here -- Its it's too far out

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:37.786
for regular studies -- Doctor

01:27:37.853 --> 01:27:41.790
stand Harris -- One thousand or

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:42.424
follow G. instructor emeritus

01:27:42.491 --> 01:27:43.825
mumble sting overstate.

01:27:43.892 --> 01:27:47.796
Has compiled notes going back --

01:27:47.863 --> 01:27:48.463
To nineteen forties and through

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:49.998
his stern studies and research

01:27:50.065 --> 01:27:51.967
both sort of gone off shore have

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:55.871
compiled some information on the

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:59.775
US pieces we have offshore --

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:00.475
There are at least forty species

01:28:00.542 --> 01:28:03.879
that utilize the offshore waters

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:07.783
off of California -- And I want
--

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.918
To I want to highlight a couple

01:28:09.985 --> 01:28:10.619
of local let me first start

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:14.022
Maria -- Including that now was

01:28:14.089 --> 01:28:15.891
a floating platform your

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.826
increase in in.

01:28:17.893 --> 01:28:21.897
Causing a marine ecology area

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:22.597
you're you're you're creating a

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:24.299
platform with two which allergy

01:28:24.366 --> 01:28:29.838
will attach -- You'll get

01:28:29.905 --> 01:28:30.505
invertebrates then are

01:28:30.572 --> 01:28:33.842
collecting around those -- The

01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:35.777
LG and fish moving it around

01:28:35.844 --> 01:28:38.013
those -- Around those two so

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:39.948
you're you're creating a a micro

01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:42.250
environment -- And I'm sure the

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.019
fisheries people will be

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:45.954
addressing that further -- We

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:49.958
have a number of pelagic species

01:28:50.025 --> 01:28:53.929
it -- Such as albatross is.

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:56.097
Sure waters petrels -- Cruise

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:56.798
the waters off shore.

01:28:56.865 --> 01:29:01.970
The strong westerlies we have --

01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:04.105
Pick up close because new

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:05.907
channel willing along the coast

01:29:05.974 --> 01:29:07.876
that new trend up willing brings

01:29:07.943 --> 01:29:08.476
a lot of there's a lot of new

01:29:08.543 --> 01:29:10.145
trenches. To the area --

01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:12.180
Providing a lot of food for

01:29:12.247 --> 01:29:16.117
Bates -- Big fish and then you

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.919
see these.

01:29:17.986 --> 01:29:20.288
Long winged narrow long wings --

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:23.925
Oceanic birds.

01:29:23.992 --> 01:29:24.659
Cruising those water there they

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:27.929
are getting left from wind
shear.

01:29:27.996 --> 01:29:30.031
Off of the water soon most of

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:31.933
the time they're going to be.

01:29:31.1000 --> 01:29:33.902
Broadly just soaring -- Looking

01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:35.904
for looking for opportunities

01:29:35.971 --> 01:29:36.605
but so you figure that once you

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.139
get to an area where you have --

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:40.075
An offshore structure could be

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:42.377
an oil well it could be a piece

01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:46.147
of of flotsam -- Where you have

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:46.848
organisms attached to it

01:29:46.915 --> 01:29:49.885
creating a small environment --

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:52.153
Gonna get small fish with that

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:57.892
and the and potentially -- Balls

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:58.593
of bait fish.

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:01.997
In which these sure waters -- Or

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.932
not just cruising flap over a

01:30:03.999 --> 01:30:06.201
water maybe -- Three meters ten

01:30:06.268 --> 01:30:08.270
feet high but or circling and

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.472
soaring high. To spot these big

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:14.009
fishing and diving down -- To to

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:16.344
get there early to get our food.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:20.148
Thirty seconds okay -- When I go

01:30:20.215 --> 01:30:29.925
to a to the US slides in please?

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:30.558
What a particular you

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:33.995
particularly of dress black

01:30:34.062 --> 01:30:37.899
Brant -- Along the coast here --

01:30:37.966 --> 01:30:40.001
Black -- Humble they were the

01:30:40.068 --> 01:30:42.137
seal grass is very important to

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.139
to the block. To the Pacific

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:52.013
black Brant -- Yeah is they

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.282
futility they feed on the rest

01:30:54.349 --> 01:30:56.151
of the band they migrate between

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:56.851
Alaska peninsula.

01:30:56.918 --> 01:31:00.255
And Baja California networks are

01:31:00.322 --> 01:31:04.292
way up the coast. To humble pan

01:31:04.359 --> 01:31:06.094
further on north of to the Puget

01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:06.761
Sound.

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:10.131
And then -- My great -- Mike a

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:11.1000
from future sound up to the

01:31:12.067 --> 01:31:12.667
Alaska peninsula.

01:31:12.734 --> 01:31:16.171
And even up -- To up to champ

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:20.041
Kamchatka peninsula.

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:22.043
You see out.

01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:24.145
That they're bringing up in the

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:26.047
office -- Yours was.

01:31:26.114 --> 01:31:28.249
In the arctic -- Concern about

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:30.418
the black rat population is it's

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.287
a lot of not a lot is known

01:31:32.354 --> 01:31:32.988
about.

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:34.089
Some of their water ecology and

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:40.295
so on the we have about a

01:31:40.362 --> 01:31:42.397
hundred and fifty thousand black

01:31:42.464 --> 01:31:43.064
Brant Pacific brand in this area

01:31:43.131 --> 01:31:46.334
here -- And that's about

01:31:46.401 --> 01:31:50.071
222-006-2000 that's about to

01:31:50.138 --> 01:31:52.207
limit -- Counting those each

01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:54.008
year up in Alaska peninsula

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:54.676
before they migrate south. To

01:31:54.743 --> 01:31:58.012
allow -- A hunting limit each

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:00.181
year based on those numbers --

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:02.283
M. sorry we're gonna have Ted

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.119
okay great policies would you

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:04.753
you have any concluding remarks

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:06.221
please.

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:10.425
Now thank you no no thank you so

01:32:10.492 --> 01:32:11.126
much so going to mobile.

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.560
We took questions will come back

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:14.429
with questions on that specific

01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:16.131
migratory patterns in just a bit

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:16.765
okay thank you so much for your

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:18.233
presentation.

01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:18.933
We are grateful that Jennifer

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:19.601
savages here she's represent the

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:20.502
Surfrider foundation -- In is

01:32:20.568 --> 01:32:22.337
the California policy manager

01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:24.172
for the foundation.

01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:26.141
The floor is yours ma'am.

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:28.510
Thank you and good afternoon

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:30.278
it's really great to be home and

01:32:30.345 --> 01:32:32.147
to see so many familiar faces.

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:34.416
I Mike from I thank you and I

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:40.155
was instructed so well Hey
there.

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.157
Good your J..

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:42.824
I was saying it's great to be

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:43.458
home it's great to see so many

01:32:43.525 --> 01:32:44.459
familiar faces and thank you

01:32:44.526 --> 01:32:45.126
senator McGuire for holding this

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:46.161
forum.

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:46.861
And and thank you to the other

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:47.462
panelists today it's been really

01:32:47.529 --> 01:32:48.163
informative so far.

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.863
In addition to working as

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:50.331
Surfrider foundation California

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.267
policy manager and I'm also a

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:52.967
twenty one year resident of

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.469
humble county has been seventeen

01:32:54.536 --> 01:32:55.170
of these years.

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:56.571
Living in Manila along Humboldt

01:32:56.638 --> 01:32:57.272
Bay.

01:32:57.338 --> 01:32:57.939
I'm extremely familiar with the

01:32:58.006 --> 01:32:58.606
challenges and the benefits of

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.208
living on the north coast and

01:33:00.275 --> 01:33:00.909
the pride that we take in our

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:02.410
connection to the natural world.

01:33:02.477 --> 01:33:04.612
I also served on the north coast

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:05.146
regional stakeholder group

01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:06.414
during the marine life

01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:08.116
protection act implementation

01:33:08.183 --> 01:33:10.118
process which proved to be a

01:33:10.185 --> 01:33:12.120
valuable opportunity and

01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:12.787
privilege really to learn more

01:33:12.854 --> 01:33:14.355
about our ocean wildlife the

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.157
concerns of our local fishermen.

01:33:16.224 --> 01:33:18.460
The complexity of balancing

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.361
multiple interest. To that end

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:22.430
Surfrider NRDC Sierra Club

01:33:22.497 --> 01:33:23.131
national Audubon society and

01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:24.499
defenders of wildlife are among

01:33:24.566 --> 01:33:26.401
the many NGOs that have been

01:33:26.468 --> 01:33:28.203
tracking and commenting on

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:28.837
California's offshore wind

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:30.371
energy process as it's been

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:32.173
moving along.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.309
First and foremost Surfrider

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:34.943
foundation always tries to

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:36.444
support renewable low impact

01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:38.446
sources of energy of course I

01:33:38.513 --> 01:33:40.181
mean that's a no brainer.

01:33:40.248 --> 01:33:42.317
Breaking free of fossil fuels is

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:44.219
a global imperative it's truly

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:44.919
the greatest imperative of our

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:46.821
time California's commitment to

01:33:46.888 --> 01:33:50.124
renewable energy is both

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:52.160
necessary and admirable.

01:33:52.227 --> 01:33:52.794
But Bob annual energy is

01:33:52.861 --> 01:33:53.394
obviously the right thing we

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:54.496
still have to do the right

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:56.164
things the right way.

01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:56.831
And that's what the concerns

01:33:56.898 --> 01:33:58.566
about officer wind energy can

01:33:58.633 --> 01:34:00.435
men well we supported in concept

01:34:00.502 --> 01:34:02.337
we remain keenly aware.

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:04.239
That as related to our waters

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:06.307
the technology is still largely

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:08.276
unproven untested launching a

01:34:08.343 --> 01:34:08.977
project offshore in an area

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:10.745
critical to marine life must be

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:12.580
done without most Karen

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:14.349
preparation.

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:16.518
M. as discuss briefly the M.

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:17.185
offshore wind farms can harm

01:34:17.252 --> 01:34:18.753
birds and number of different

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.288
ways.

01:34:20.355 --> 01:34:20.989
Electromagnetic fields

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:22.524
underwater noises and vibrations

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.292
can affect orientation and

01:34:24.359 --> 01:34:26.261
navigational ability.

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:26.961
Of our marine mammals one your

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:28.696
wind turbine generators produce

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:30.598
less sound than older turbines

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:32.634
impact of low frequency sound on

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.502
whales dolphins and other ocean

01:34:34.569 --> 01:34:36.237
creatures still need to be

01:34:36.304 --> 01:34:36.871
investigated.

01:34:36.938 --> 01:34:38.373
Under water support pilings

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:40.241
anchoring devices scour

01:34:40.308 --> 01:34:40.875
protection materials and

01:34:40.942 --> 01:34:42.477
electromagnetic fields could

01:34:42.544 --> 01:34:44.546
cross cause an increase or

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:46.447
decrease invent the community's

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:48.283
ultranationalist vitamins.

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:52.487
And possibly a at migration

01:34:52.554 --> 01:34:54.289
patterns.

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:56.558
Loading hit a power cables can

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:57.191
lead to entanglement of whales

01:34:57.258 --> 01:34:58.326
and other marine mammals and

01:34:58.393 --> 01:34:58.960
there's there's other concerns

01:34:59.027 --> 01:34:59.627
as well that sandy will be

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:00.495
speaking greater details about

01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:02.297
those and other threats.

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.265
So I will move on to say.

01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:04.933
That despite the admirable

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:06.634
quantity of meetings that bone

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:08.603
in the C. C. have held what

01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:10.405
we're hearing from community

01:35:10.471 --> 01:35:11.105
members is the need for improved

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:12.473
quality of meetings.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.409
Clearly opportunities exist for

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:16.511
a more inclusive and transparent

01:35:16.578 --> 01:35:18.346
process that would ensure site

01:35:18.413 --> 01:35:20.481
selection reflects environmental

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.283
and other concerns.

01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.984
Surfrider in our colleague

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:24.485
organizations have consistently

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:26.254
advocated for a scientifically

01:35:26.321 --> 01:35:28.256
and stakeholder driven citing

01:35:28.323 --> 01:35:30.291
process that prioritizes.

01:35:30.358 --> 01:35:32.393
Environmental sensitivities.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.094
Specifically we've asked the

01:35:33.161 --> 01:35:34.729
state to help secure funding for

01:35:34.796 --> 01:35:36.264
third party scientific analysis

01:35:36.331 --> 01:35:38.333
of the data in the database and

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:39.033
and the creation of an

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.401
environmental sensitivity layer.

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:42.670
Anteon cyst on a process that

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:44.372
such high environmental bar for

01:35:44.439 --> 01:35:46.474
this new technology in the ocean

01:35:46.541 --> 01:35:48.509
that is so vital to our economy

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:49.177
and our well being.

01:35:49.244 --> 01:35:50.612
So we were heartened when last

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:51.112
November at because the

01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:52.380
commission meeting

01:35:52.447 --> 01:35:54.248
representatives of the coastal

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:54.882
commission energy commission a

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:56.284
state lands commission.

01:35:56.351 --> 01:35:58.253
Adamantly supported these ask

01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:00.255
but nearly six months later

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:00.855
there's been no follow up.

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:02.523
Even today we've heard the

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.091
phrase looking forward to in

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:04.692
regards to figuring out

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:06.361
virtually every single detail

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:07.061
that needs to happen between now

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:08.863
and the actual deployment of the

01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:10.465
turbines.

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:12.433
If we should get so far which is

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:13.034
fine and it's appropriate.

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:14.769
But it also suggests that

01:36:14.836 --> 01:36:16.437
building a wind farm out at sea

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:18.439
has a lot of challenges yet to

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:19.140
be solved.

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:20.608
So well we want to increase the

01:36:20.675 --> 01:36:22.343
promise of offshore wind

01:36:22.410 --> 01:36:23.011
enthusiastically we definitely

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:24.812
need much more information to

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:26.514
show that the potential benefits

01:36:26.581 --> 01:36:28.516
can actually manifest at all.

01:36:28.583 --> 01:36:30.485
And can do so without harming

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:31.185
the birds fish and marine

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:36.391
mammals already facing threats.

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:38.359
Thank you so much miss savage as

01:36:38.426 --> 01:36:38.960
a follow up questions here in

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:42.397
just a bit.

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:43.031
We're not gonna turn over to

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:43.598
miss it was worth it

01:36:43.665 --> 01:36:44.499
representing the natural

01:36:44.565 --> 01:36:45.199
resources defense council.

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:46.434
Says with your five minutes the

01:36:46.501 --> 01:36:48.403
foreshores thank you.

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:50.371
At first like Ted just express

01:36:50.438 --> 01:36:52.540
my regret that I have to follow

01:36:52.607 --> 01:36:54.409
John savage.

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:56.644
Again I'm sandy Ellsworth with

01:36:56.711 --> 01:36:58.379
the natural resources defense

01:36:58.446 --> 01:37:00.381
council and I'm with the energy

01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:02.383
C. oceans program.

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:04.452
I want to thank senator McGuire

01:37:04.519 --> 01:37:05.153
for hosting.

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:08.356
This forum and hearing and also

01:37:08.423 --> 01:37:10.358
for so whole heartedly embracing

01:37:10.425 --> 01:37:12.493
the idea right off the bat that.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.529
In order to develop offshore

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:16.464
wind we need to do it in a way

01:37:16.531 --> 01:37:17.098
that protects the marine

01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:20.435
environment and factors and

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:22.403
other stakeholder uses.

01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:23.071
California is a leader in

01:37:23.137 --> 01:37:24.739
climate change mitigation and

01:37:24.806 --> 01:37:26.774
marine protections self let's

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:28.843
guide with these two principles

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:30.778
elevating them both equally we

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:34.682
can do at I also just wanted to

01:37:34.749 --> 01:37:36.384
share that this is the first

01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:38.386
time I've been -- So far north

01:37:38.453 --> 01:37:39.020
in California and it was

01:37:39.087 --> 01:37:40.688
immediately clear driving in

01:37:40.755 --> 01:37:44.359
yesterday just how special

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:46.494
humble bay is.

01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:48.396
An RTC fully.

01:37:48.463 --> 01:37:50.765
Recognizes that addressing

01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:52.734
climate change through dramatic

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.469
D. carbonization is urgently

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:55.069
needed.

01:37:55.136 --> 01:37:56.938
As such we are of course.

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:58.840
Supportive of responsibly cited

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:00.875
offshore wind we've been very

01:38:00.942 --> 01:38:02.543
active in the Atlantic in

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:03.211
promoting at and working with

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:06.547
developers to ensure that the

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:07.115
highest degree of marine

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:08.716
protections are upheld.

01:38:08.783 --> 01:38:10.585
Today I'm going to discuss some

01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:11.285
of the environmental

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:12.820
considerations building on chat

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:14.989
and Jen's remarks -- Some of the

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:16.958
environmental considerations the

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:18.760
Saudis associated with floating

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:20.762
offshore wind and I'd also like

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:22.497
to highlight some of the science

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:23.131
needs.

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.599
And research priorities that

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:28.469
energy C. and other

01:38:28.536 --> 01:38:30.505
organizations have identified.

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:31.139
Can I have the next slide please

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:31.439
[inaudible]

01:38:31.506 --> 01:38:36.511
Great.

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:38.579
I briefly highlight some

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:40.481
environmental considerations

01:38:40.548 --> 01:38:41.048
associated with floating

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.683
offshore wind turbine so

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.752
hopefully these two images are

01:38:44.819 --> 01:38:46.521
somewhat instructive.

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:48.623
There's concern about habitat

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:50.591
loss there's no denying that

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:52.660
these turbines will have some

01:38:52.727 --> 01:38:53.327
sort of benthic foot print they

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:54.529
have to attach to the C..

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:55.163
For so where they're placed is

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:56.697
very important.

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.699
They also penetrate all of the

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.701
water column with very long

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.670
cables because they use

01:39:02.737 --> 01:39:04.539
incurring systems.

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:06.574
Which is about a fat in some

01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:07.275
regards.

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:09.010
But there is plenty of potential

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:12.480
for in all of water interaction

01:39:12.547 --> 01:39:14.515
with the many cables.

01:39:14.582 --> 01:39:16.484
There's also concern about

01:39:16.551 --> 01:39:18.486
secondary entanglement we're

01:39:18.553 --> 01:39:19.153
very clear on the fact that the

01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.888
mooring lines have a huge

01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:22.523
circumference.

01:39:22.590 --> 01:39:24.492
So there's not tremendous

01:39:24.559 --> 01:39:26.494
concern about primary direct

01:39:26.561 --> 01:39:28.496
entanglement from marine mammals

01:39:28.563 --> 01:39:29.197
interacting with those cables.

01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:32.500
However there is a concern that

01:39:32.567 --> 01:39:34.602
marine debris and fishing gear

01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:36.537
could become entangled in.

01:39:36.604 --> 01:39:40.575
The very many cables within an

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:41.242
off shore floating [inaudible]

01:39:41.309 --> 01:39:44.846
Wind farm. One of the reasons

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:46.747
that were so supportive of

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:48.716
starting small and then scaling

01:39:48.783 --> 01:39:50.551
up developments incrementally is

01:39:50.618 --> 01:39:52.486
to see how these interactions

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:53.154
between sea turtles and marine

01:39:53.221 --> 01:39:54.889
mammals play out with cables.

01:39:54.956 --> 01:39:58.526
In the field.

01:39:58.593 --> 01:40:01.095
Citing offshore wind turbines

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:02.663
should prioritize avoiding

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:04.866
sensitive habitat areas then

01:40:04.932 --> 01:40:06.834
requiring strong measures to

01:40:06.901 --> 01:40:08.769
protect wildlife throughout each

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:10.638
stage of the development
process.

01:40:10.705 --> 01:40:12.673
And then there should be

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.642
comprehensive monitoring.

01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:16.677
Of wildlife and habitat before

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.646
during and after construction.

01:40:18.713 --> 01:40:21.015
Following this framework of

01:40:21.082 --> 01:40:22.650
avoidance.

01:40:22.717 --> 01:40:24.685
Prioritizing avoidance is

01:40:24.752 --> 01:40:26.621
essential for responsibly

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.623
developing offshore wind energy.

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:32.593
The next slide please

01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:32.894
[inaudible]

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.631
Thanks.

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.799
And next [inaudible]

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:42.637
One thank you.

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:44.672
Now I'd like to discuss some of

01:40:44.739 --> 01:40:45.373
the environmental considerations

01:40:45.439 --> 01:40:47.074
specific to the humble call area

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:48.776
which you'll see up there

01:40:48.843 --> 01:40:50.645
outlined in yellow.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:52.647
On this side you'll see.

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.982
Our he said that the outline of

01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:56.784
the humble call area -- So it's

01:40:56.851 --> 01:40:58.953
hard to tell from this image but

01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:00.855
one of the concerns that we have

01:41:00.922 --> 01:41:01.322
is about the thank the

01:41:01.389 --> 01:41:02.657
communities.

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.659
That live on the sea floor I

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:06.794
mentioned before that it's going

01:41:06.861 --> 01:41:08.596
to be important to avoid placing

01:41:08.663 --> 01:41:09.230
anchors and sensitive habitat.

01:41:09.297 --> 01:41:10.932
There's limited information

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:12.833
about the Ben those of the

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:13.467
humble call area.

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:14.969
However in twenty sixteen if

01:41:15.036 --> 01:41:17.104
there was some work -- Using an

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:20.641
autonomous underwater vehicle.

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:21.309
And that characterized to some

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:24.979
of the C. for habitat near the

01:41:25.046 --> 01:41:25.613
call area.

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.747
The expedition found twenty

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:28.616
species of corals eight species

01:41:28.683 --> 01:41:30.618
of sponges and eighteen species

01:41:30.685 --> 01:41:32.920
of fish near the couple humble

01:41:32.987 --> 01:41:33.521
call area.

01:41:33.588 --> 01:41:34.855
This observe diversity and

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.991
density of species demonstrates

01:41:37.058 --> 01:41:38.926
that a thorough Ben take survey

01:41:38.993 --> 01:41:40.795
should occur in the call area to

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:42.830
identify areas with high levels

01:41:42.897 --> 01:41:44.665
of diversity.

01:41:44.732 --> 01:41:45.333
In order to minimize benthic

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:47.068
impacts it's also important to

01:41:47.134 --> 01:41:48.869
note that the call area is

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.838
situated between two submarine

01:41:50.905 --> 01:41:52.907
canyons one is your canyon to

01:41:52.974 --> 01:41:54.842
the south and the other is

01:41:54.909 --> 01:42:04.819
Trinidad canyon. To the north.

01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:05.486
Even though we know one minute

01:42:05.553 --> 01:42:06.821
great thank you very much. One

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:08.789
thing to note about the

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:09.457
submarine canyons is that they

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:11.125
are well documented to service

01:42:11.192 --> 01:42:14.729
habitats nurseries forage areas

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:16.731
refugia in carbon sequenced

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:18.866
carbon sequestration and storage

01:42:18.933 --> 01:42:19.567
areas.

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:21.002
It's unknown how development in

01:42:21.068 --> 01:42:23.104
proximity to these canyons may

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:24.905
affect the canyon's ecosystem

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:27.108
functions and the services they

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:28.743
provide.

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:30.778
That's why starting small and

01:42:30.845 --> 01:42:31.345
monitoring very carefully is

01:42:31.412 --> 01:42:32.747
critical.

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:35.182
Finally it with regard to marine

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:36.851
mammals there at least thirty

01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:37.485
species of marine mammals that

01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:39.086
live in California coastal

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:41.055
waters the wood detailed

01:42:41.122 --> 01:42:42.857
analysis for only a small number

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:44.859
of those occurring in the

01:42:44.925 --> 01:42:45.559
offshore wind areas.

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:47.261
Has been conducted. For many of

01:42:47.328 --> 01:42:49.063
the species with known

01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:50.798
distributions the data are not

01:42:50.865 --> 01:42:52.767
fine enough to make localized.

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:55.136
Decisions in a humble call area.

01:42:55.202 --> 01:42:57.104
There's certainly a need for

01:42:57.171 --> 01:42:59.006
better data on blue whales and

01:42:59.073 --> 01:43:02.777
great wealth.

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:04.845
Among others I'm sure. To

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:07.081
conclude I'm going to underscore

01:43:07.148 --> 01:43:08.816
some of the key research needs

01:43:08.883 --> 01:43:10.985
and I can see that my time is up

01:43:11.052 --> 01:43:13.120
and sell I will really conclude

01:43:13.187 --> 01:43:13.821
quickly.

01:43:13.888 --> 01:43:17.091
I'm I wanted to building on what

01:43:17.158 --> 01:43:19.060
Jennifer mentioned about the

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:20.761
importance of prioritizing a

01:43:20.828 --> 01:43:23.030
robust analysis of the existing

01:43:23.097 --> 01:43:24.999
information that's in the

01:43:25.066 --> 01:43:26.801
database and I also wanted to

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:28.803
add that having three years of

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:29.370
robust baseline data.

01:43:29.437 --> 01:43:31.072
Has a great potential to

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:33.140
actually benefit the offshore

01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:34.775
wind industry.

01:43:34.842 --> 01:43:35.409
If you have a in in adequate

01:43:35.476 --> 01:43:38.813
baseline that could lead to

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:40.781
profound delays in the future.

01:43:40.848 --> 01:43:42.817
Energy C. looks forward to

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.752
working with the California

01:43:44.819 --> 01:43:45.419
coastal commission ocean

01:43:45.486 --> 01:43:47.021
protection council California

01:43:47.088 --> 01:43:49.090
energy commission and bill meant

01:43:49.156 --> 01:43:50.858
to ensure.

01:43:50.925 --> 01:43:51.492
That offshore wind development

01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:53.194
upholds the highest level of

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:54.929
environmental protections thank

01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:57.064
you thank you so much we're

01:43:57.131 --> 01:43:57.765
grateful to our pan -- We'd like

01:43:57.832 --> 01:43:59.133
to be an open up some questions

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.469
here I would like to be to go --

01:44:01.535 --> 01:44:05.139
To miss Ellsworth first so we

01:44:05.206 --> 01:44:05.806
talked with my energy sees work

01:44:05.873 --> 01:44:07.141
in the Atlantic -- Is our

01:44:07.208 --> 01:44:10.845
ongoing monitoring -- Of what

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:11.545
you've seen deployed fill us in

01:44:11.612 --> 01:44:13.314
on that and that's been an issue

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:17.284
that wanted that makes that we

01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:18.018
address today.

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.053
That's a great question I am
not.

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.857
So here's what I can say about
--

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:24.859
Our work in the Atlantic we were

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.128
instrumental in developing --

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:29.463
Working with a regional planning

01:44:29.530 --> 01:44:31.098
process and not is one of the

01:44:31.165 --> 01:44:32.833
elements of offshore when

01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:33.534
planning that we seem to be

01:44:33.601 --> 01:44:36.837
really successful -- For example

01:44:36.904 --> 01:44:39.006
the Rhode Island -- I'm sure

01:44:39.073 --> 01:44:40.875
when development.

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:42.843
Undertook an extensive planning

01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:44.845
process in which energy C. was

01:44:44.912 --> 01:44:45.479
very active and part of that

01:44:45.546 --> 01:44:47.114
process was identifying

01:44:47.181 --> 01:44:49.049
important ecological areas so.

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:51.118
Some so that offshore wind

01:44:51.185 --> 01:44:53.053
development was cited with those

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.156
in mind and as a result the

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:58.859
permitting for that project map

01:44:58.926 --> 01:45:00.928
very quickly -- Another part of

01:45:00.995 --> 01:45:01.595
our involvement has been working

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:03.164
really closely with developers

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:05.266
in that protection of the north

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:06.867
Atlantic right whale.

01:45:06.934 --> 01:45:09.136
And after years of negotiations
--

01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:11.038
Energy C. into other

01:45:11.105 --> 01:45:12.873
environmental groups were.

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:15.075
Really proud to announce a

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:17.011
collaboration with Ben vineyard

01:45:17.077 --> 01:45:20.881
when where the developer agreed.

01:45:20.948 --> 01:45:21.549
To certain key mitigation

01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:23.150
measures cell protecting right

01:45:23.217 --> 01:45:25.152
wells from the acoustic impacts

01:45:25.219 --> 01:45:27.054
of geophysical surveys and

01:45:27.121 --> 01:45:28.889
undertaking.

01:45:28.956 --> 01:45:30.858
Key construction activities

01:45:30.925 --> 01:45:31.492
during periods where the wheels

01:45:31.559 --> 01:45:33.060
were less sensitive.

01:45:33.127 --> 01:45:35.362
So to summarize about our work

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:37.231
in that northeast I would say

01:45:37.298 --> 01:45:39.233
that -- We've been very involved

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:43.003
in both -- Contributing to the

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.838
science and also -- Advocating

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:47.041
strongly to really elevate the

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:48.876
scientific.

01:45:48.943 --> 01:45:53.013
Elevate citing that factors in

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:53.681
scientific considerations.

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:55.349
You know those mostly floating

01:45:55.416 --> 01:45:57.318
platforms or they actually

01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:59.186
drilled and can you just fuller

01:45:59.253 --> 01:46:01.121
piled on Ben okay there yeah.

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:02.990
Right so.

01:46:03.057 --> 01:46:03.657
In terms of floating.

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:05.392
Turbines -- There are there's

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.261
the project in Scotland and

01:46:07.328 --> 01:46:11.065
there is no floating project in.

01:46:11.131 --> 01:46:12.967
The United States right now

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:15.302
Connie thank you so much -- For

01:46:15.369 --> 01:46:17.371
the three of you on going

01:46:17.438 --> 01:46:19.406
monitoring is an important --
It.

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:21.442
Item that you'd like to be a C.

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:23.010
dressed.

01:46:23.077 --> 01:46:24.979
Of both fisheries and wildlife.

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:27.348
Yes absolutely I mean with

01:46:27.414 --> 01:46:29.216
without monitoring we don't know

01:46:29.283 --> 01:46:31.085
what's happening and so given

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:31.752
especially the fact that it's

01:46:31.819 --> 01:46:35.055
such a new technology and that

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:35.723
we don't know how well it will

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:37.057
work and what the impacts will

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:37.725
be.

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:39.226
Monitoring would be critical.

01:46:39.293 --> 01:46:41.028
Thank you so much miss Ogan so

01:46:41.095 --> 01:46:42.963
look at humble bays you said in

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.664
our entire read.

01:46:43.731 --> 01:46:46.967
Tire north coast region -- It's

01:46:47.034 --> 01:46:50.971
critical -- For back brand --

01:46:51.038 --> 01:46:52.973
Why and -- Also if you could

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:53.607
just address that a bit -- And

01:46:53.674 --> 01:46:55.142
then if you can also just

01:46:55.209 --> 01:46:56.977
address ongoing monitoring and

01:46:57.044 --> 01:46:57.578
if you think that is important

01:46:57.645 --> 01:46:59.013
on one side.

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:01.282
Thank you -- Your grass grows

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:03.083
throughout the west coast from

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:05.019
my canteen.

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:05.686
On up most through the whole

01:47:05.753 --> 01:47:09.056
west coast of North America on

01:47:09.123 --> 01:47:12.993
up into the Alaska peninsula.

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:15.229
Your grass is the primary

01:47:15.296 --> 01:47:19.266
component -- For forging black

01:47:19.333 --> 01:47:21.268
Brant -- They migrate down to

01:47:21.335 --> 01:47:23.270
Baja California and work away up

01:47:23.337 --> 01:47:27.207
the coast -- In the fall and

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:29.009
work your way up to the coast.

01:47:29.076 --> 01:47:32.980
Through the water time and then
--

01:47:33.047 --> 01:47:33.614
Up to their breeding grounds in

01:47:33.681 --> 01:47:35.049
the north slope of Alaska --

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:41.088
There are no populations of lack

01:47:41.155 --> 01:47:43.157
of our Pacific Brent there are

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:45.125
non migratory seem to be hanging

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:45.626
around the a lot Alaska

01:47:45.693 --> 01:47:47.027
peninsula.

01:47:47.094 --> 01:47:51.098
And this is a product of global

01:47:51.165 --> 01:47:55.135
climate change in which so large

01:47:55.202 --> 01:47:57.137
is now reaching down to the

01:47:57.204 --> 01:47:57.805
bottoms of the oceans there

01:47:57.871 --> 01:47:59.440
where the you guys gets enough

01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:01.508
sunlight to be able to produce

01:48:01.575 --> 01:48:05.212
energy that they need to live --

01:48:05.279 --> 01:48:05.913
I see this is an opportunity

01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.548
with having platforms off shore

01:48:07.614 --> 01:48:08.182
to be able.

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:09.283
To put monitoring devices on

01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:11.085
these black brown to a large

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:13.187
body Berkeley usually Kerio.

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:13.887
Real color trance transmitted

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:17.091
formation -- As to where they're

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:17.725
migrating to wear their

01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:19.393
marketing from when they're

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.495
migrating -- Elevation of their

01:48:21.562 --> 01:48:23.464
migration the callers it'd been

01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:25.466
developed so far that are being

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:29.103
used -- Collect information

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:29.770
numbers well they're moving

01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:31.338
throughout the ocean and then

01:48:31.405 --> 01:48:31.939
when they get near cell phone

01:48:32.006 --> 01:48:33.107
cut tower.

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:33.774
It downloads information from

01:48:33.841 --> 01:48:35.342
the last time that that color

01:48:35.409 --> 01:48:39.313
was -- Downloaded -- Even to

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:41.615
even to downloading some

01:48:41.682 --> 01:48:43.317
information awesome to G. towers

01:48:43.384 --> 01:48:53.093
off of these species absolutely

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:53.794
no thank you and I just made a

01:48:53.861 --> 01:48:55.295
note of that as well -- For the

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:57.231
three of you.

01:48:57.297 --> 01:48:59.500
What I heard from to view is

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:01.568
it's important start I'm

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:03.270
paraphrasing here important

01:49:03.337 --> 01:49:05.239
start formalizing -- The

01:49:05.305 --> 01:49:09.109
feedback loop -- It especially

01:49:09.176 --> 01:49:11.178
the closer we get to leases so

01:49:11.245 --> 01:49:13.313
we may see leases in twenty

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:13.914
twenty twenty twenty one right

01:49:13.981 --> 01:49:15.315
somewhere in that range.

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:17.317
And what I'm hearing is that it

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:19.186
would be -- For important

01:49:19.253 --> 01:49:21.221
formalize the feedback loop from

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:21.855
stakeholders whether it's

01:49:21.922 --> 01:49:23.323
environmental organizations

01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:25.325
fishery groups -- As these

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:29.163
leases are getting closer -- To

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:31.598
being formalized please jump in.

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:33.100
I would say that's absolutely

01:49:33.167 --> 01:49:35.335
correct and I mean this hearing

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:37.171
today has been so instructive in

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:37.805
the kind of conversations that

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:39.373
we need to be having.

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.577
And I as I said I think there's

01:49:43.644 --> 01:49:45.612
a bit of a disconnect -- Where

01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:47.147
we have on one hand?

01:49:47.214 --> 01:49:49.416
This you know we're going we

01:49:49.483 --> 01:49:49.983
have to get like we'd need

01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:51.418
renewable energy like we

01:49:51.485 --> 01:49:52.086
absolutely do there's Boston

01:49:52.152 --> 01:49:55.189
about it -- But there is this

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:55.889
sort of pitch to the local

01:49:55.956 --> 01:49:57.658
community about like we're going

01:49:57.724 --> 01:49:59.193
to put in the softer wind farm

01:49:59.259 --> 01:49:59.860
it's going to create a gazillion

01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:01.662
jobs is going to solve all our

01:50:01.728 --> 01:50:03.230
problems it's wonderful.

01:50:03.297 --> 01:50:03.864
And maybe that's all true we

01:50:03.931 --> 01:50:05.632
don't really have all the

01:50:05.699 --> 01:50:07.468
information that we need that

01:50:07.534 --> 01:50:09.336
and yes there's been eighty

01:50:09.403 --> 01:50:10.003
meetings but a lot of those

01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:11.405
meetings have been essentially

01:50:11.472 --> 01:50:13.340
the same thing and it so.

01:50:13.407 --> 01:50:15.209
You know that it's not like that

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:17.277
information is necessarily new

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:19.213
or that it's getting to new

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:21.215
people or that the and people

01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:23.283
who are leading have as much of

01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:25.319
an understanding an overview.

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:27.521
About what else is needed I mean

01:50:27.588 --> 01:50:29.456
I feel like I've learned just

01:50:29.523 --> 01:50:30.057
like I said so much today I

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:31.592
really appreciate this and

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:37.197
appreciate the other panelists
--

01:50:37.264 --> 01:50:39.233
You have the so in making a

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:39.800
feedback loop that is more

01:50:39.867 --> 01:50:41.435
formal more structured.

01:50:41.502 --> 01:50:42.069
We can ideally get everybody on

01:50:42.136 --> 01:50:43.437
the same page which I don't

01:50:43.504 --> 01:50:45.339
think we are now and again.

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:47.341
Like we support renewable energy

01:50:47.407 --> 01:50:49.476
on just be really clear about we

01:50:49.543 --> 01:50:50.177
just want.

01:50:50.244 --> 01:50:51.745
It all to all the information to

01:50:51.812 --> 01:50:53.614
be up front and available to

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.616
everybody in the public we need

01:50:55.682 --> 01:50:57.284
a balanced approach right yeah
--

01:50:57.351 --> 01:50:57.985
We can't sacrifice one for the

01:50:58.051 --> 01:51:01.221
other and by the way the reason

01:51:01.288 --> 01:51:01.889
why we're moving forward

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:03.357
renewable energies at for the

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:05.359
planet right and so we have to

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:07.361
be able to have -- Forward

01:51:07.427 --> 01:51:09.363
thinking and mitigation I once

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:11.365
we C. deployment please.

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:13.500
Short and just setting Ted Jen's

01:51:13.567 --> 01:51:15.536
comments -- It's really

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:16.236
important to note that

01:51:16.303 --> 01:51:21.308
California has experience in at

01:51:21.375 --> 01:51:23.610
least -- Elevating environmental

01:51:23.677 --> 01:51:24.278
considerations and other

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:25.312
stakeholder concerned so there

01:51:25.379 --> 01:51:27.214
was that does renewable energy

01:51:27.281 --> 01:51:29.316
conservation plan process that

01:51:29.383 --> 01:51:31.451
went on for over a decade -- And

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:35.322
is still in place -- And there

01:51:35.389 --> 01:51:37.357
it was also the San Joaquin

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:39.493
solar siting project wherein.

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:41.295
Least conflict areas for

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:43.597
development were developed in a

01:51:43.664 --> 01:51:47.267
six month time frame so I think.

01:51:47.334 --> 01:51:47.901
Going back to what John just

01:51:47.968 --> 01:51:51.338
said it seems like there is

01:51:51.405 --> 01:51:52.005
agreement that the sort of

01:51:52.072 --> 01:51:55.208
process is necessary one that

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:55.842
includes lots of stakeholders

01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:57.377
one that prioritizes

01:51:57.444 --> 01:51:59.479
environmental concerns and those

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:00.113
of other stakeholders.

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:01.848
And so it's getting down to

01:52:01.915 --> 01:52:03.684
brass tacks and sort of figuring

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:05.786
out what who's going to pay for

01:52:05.852 --> 01:52:07.754
it who's going to convene at and

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:09.623
who should participate.

01:52:09.690 --> 01:52:11.325
But again giving California's

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:13.627
experience I think that's

01:52:13.694 --> 01:52:15.329
eminently doable it just needs

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:15.963
to happen and needs to become a

01:52:16.029 --> 01:52:17.431
priority.

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:18.065
Thank you so much we're gonna

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:19.733
offer -- Very brief closing

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:21.535
comments anything that I may

01:52:21.602 --> 01:52:23.537
have missed -- Or any items that

01:52:23.604 --> 01:52:24.238
you would like to be able to

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:27.341
advance we'll start to my right

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:28.041
worker way dentre let's start

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:29.543
with Andy please -- Any closing

01:52:29.610 --> 01:52:31.545
comments that you'd like to be

01:52:31.612 --> 01:52:37.351
able to advance briefly.

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:38.018
Don't think of anything to add

01:52:38.085 --> 01:52:41.321
other than -- Again I just

01:52:41.388 --> 01:52:43.390
really wanted to thank you for

01:52:43.457 --> 01:52:45.359
advancing this conversation.

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:46.026
You so much for being here in

01:52:46.093 --> 01:52:47.628
super helpful -- In regard to

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:49.663
talking about where you've been

01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:51.331
in the Atlantic as far as energy

01:52:51.398 --> 01:52:53.533
C. -- And then also how we need

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.435
to be a formalized process thank

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:57.371
you so much please accept.

01:52:57.437 --> 01:52:58.071
I don't have too much to ask but

01:52:58.138 --> 01:52:59.806
I would just say that as a long

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:01.575
time not because president and

01:53:01.642 --> 01:53:03.343
somebody who went through that

01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:04.011
mean like protects not process.

01:53:04.077 --> 01:53:07.381
And I think that it is very.

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:09.583
Clear that when and the state

01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:11.585
agencies are working on projects

01:53:11.652 --> 01:53:12.185
in the north coast that they

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:15.355
need to make a very.

01:53:15.422 --> 01:53:17.457
Dedicated and determined effort

01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:19.393
to understand the particular and

01:53:19.459 --> 01:53:21.528
unique needs of this area and

01:53:21.595 --> 01:53:22.229
address them.

01:53:22.296 --> 01:53:24.031
And I appreciate your efforts in

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:27.567
that that world I guess machine

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:28.235
thank you so much for being here

01:53:28.302 --> 01:53:29.369
check.

01:53:29.436 --> 01:53:31.605
Hi sue this is an opportunity

01:53:31.672 --> 01:53:35.609
now was. Five or ten years down

01:53:35.676 --> 01:53:37.444
the road before we really see a

01:53:37.511 --> 01:53:39.379
developing offshore wind farm.

01:53:39.446 --> 01:53:41.615
To start doing office do start

01:53:41.682 --> 01:53:42.315
doing research offshore also

01:53:42.382 --> 01:53:43.784
these plastics pieces around her

01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:45.819
finding out getting a bass line

01:53:45.886 --> 01:53:49.556
and what's out there.

01:53:49.623 --> 01:53:51.625
And then we'll see -- Once the

01:53:51.692 --> 01:53:52.292
platforms are established and to

01:53:52.359 --> 01:53:53.660
be able.

01:53:53.727 --> 01:53:55.629
To continue that find out.

01:53:55.696 --> 01:53:57.664
More information on what the

01:53:57.731 --> 01:53:59.733
speeches are using our current

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.702
technology cameras and so on

01:54:01.768 --> 01:54:03.437
like that too check the species

01:54:03.503 --> 01:54:05.806
and then -- Begin to look at the

01:54:05.872 --> 01:54:07.607
final results of that.

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:09.543
And I think of working with

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:11.578
shots energy and their program

01:54:11.645 --> 01:54:13.680
and now looking at somebody

01:54:13.747 --> 01:54:17.451
offers pieces is a good chance

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:19.486
to also work with them.

01:54:19.553 --> 01:54:20.087
Thank you so much round of

01:54:20.153 --> 01:54:21.755
applause for environmental

01:54:21.822 --> 01:54:23.590
panels they take you so much

01:54:23.657 --> 01:54:27.461
thank you for your time

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:27.794
[inaudible]

01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:29.496
Grateful.

01:54:29.563 --> 01:54:30.197
We're trying to get a present a

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:31.465
well rounded hearing here today

01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:32.065
hearing from agencies in the

01:54:32.132 --> 01:54:33.467
industry the environmental

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:34.101
organizations and now were

01:54:34.167 --> 01:54:35.702
welcoming -- The fleet to be

01:54:35.769 --> 01:54:37.604
able to come for our last panel
--

01:54:37.671 --> 01:54:39.606
Is title California's fisheries

01:54:39.673 --> 01:54:41.641
and offer winningest energy can

01:54:41.708 --> 01:54:43.643
win in fish co exist or will the

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.512
plan flounder -- So we'd like to

01:54:45.579 --> 01:54:47.681
be able to welcome.

01:54:47.748 --> 01:54:49.449

01:54:51.518 --> 01:54:53.754
On a Friday we are gonna welcome

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:55.722
three individuals -- Here to the

01:54:55.789 --> 01:54:57.691
table -- First and foremost so

01:54:57.758 --> 01:54:59.559
we're gonna be hearing from

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:01.461
Harrison I. Bach is the

01:55:01.528 --> 01:55:01.995
president of the humble

01:55:02.062 --> 01:55:02.696
fisherman's marketing

01:55:02.763 --> 01:55:03.864
association within can hear from

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:05.699
no Oppenheim the exact --

01:55:05.766 --> 01:55:06.299
Director of the Pacific coast

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:07.734
federation of fishermen's

01:55:07.801 --> 01:55:09.770
associations and we're really

01:55:09.836 --> 01:55:10.404
grateful Andy Hawkins is here

01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:11.838
she's the exact -- Director

01:55:11.905 --> 01:55:13.840
responsible offshore development

01:55:13.907 --> 01:55:15.842
alliance so we're gonna start

01:55:15.909 --> 01:55:17.477
with yours and work our way down

01:55:17.544 --> 01:55:19.446
to my right -- And we welcome

01:55:19.513 --> 01:55:21.915
the three to the form thank you

01:55:21.982 --> 01:55:23.917
so much. For being here try back

01:55:23.984 --> 01:55:25.852
you have five minutes the floor

01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:31.892
is yours and give you thirty

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:35.495
second prompt.

01:55:35.562 --> 01:55:37.497
Thank you Sir McGuire.

01:55:37.564 --> 01:55:38.165
My name is Harrison I. Bach I am

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:39.766
the president of humble

01:55:39.833 --> 01:55:41.668
Fishman's marketing association.

01:55:41.735 --> 01:55:42.369
The concept of offshore wind

01:55:42.436 --> 01:55:43.470
energy is not new in other parts

01:55:43.537 --> 01:55:44.171
of the world.

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:45.772
It is not new on the east coast

01:55:45.839 --> 01:55:46.440
of the United States.

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:47.941
But the concept is new to the

01:55:48.008 --> 01:55:49.743
west coast and especially here

01:55:49.810 --> 01:55:51.611
in California.

01:55:51.678 --> 01:55:53.613
What is known as the fact that

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:54.281
on the west coast of the United

01:55:54.347 --> 01:55:55.482
States in a particularly

01:55:55.549 --> 01:55:57.717
California we have some of the

01:55:57.784 --> 01:55:58.318
most sustainable fisheries in

01:55:58.385 --> 01:55:59.586
the world?

01:55:59.653 --> 01:56:01.755
Here Fishman face many

01:56:01.822 --> 01:56:02.389
challenges as our fisheries are

01:56:02.456 --> 01:56:03.890
some of the most highly

01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:04.491
regulated.

01:56:04.558 --> 01:56:06.026
With gear restrictions in

01:56:06.092 --> 01:56:07.727
limited fishing seasons.

01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:09.896
But notably there also a large

01:56:09.963 --> 01:56:11.565
amount of areas that are already

01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:12.199
closed to fishing that exists in

01:56:12.265 --> 01:56:13.600
this state.

01:56:13.667 --> 01:56:15.569
We had marine protected areas

01:56:15.635 --> 01:56:17.604
rock fish conservation areas.

01:56:17.671 --> 01:56:19.606
Ascential fish habitat.

01:56:19.673 --> 01:56:21.608
Marine sanctuaries.

01:56:21.675 --> 01:56:23.610
Scott conservation areas in a

01:56:23.677 --> 01:56:25.679
wide variety of other areas

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:26.379
already closed to fishing.

01:56:26.446 --> 01:56:28.114
If one were to look at a map it

01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:29.749
is quite simple to see that the

01:56:29.816 --> 01:56:31.585
entire state is littered with

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:32.185
large areas that are already

01:56:32.252 --> 01:56:33.620
closed to fishing.

01:56:33.687 --> 01:56:35.722
These offshore wind energy

01:56:35.789 --> 01:56:37.591
projects will permanently take

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:38.258
away an additional hundreds of

01:56:38.325 --> 01:56:39.926
square miles of ocean from

01:56:39.993 --> 01:56:41.962
fishermen as we are unable to

01:56:42.028 --> 01:56:45.599
fish within these vast areas.

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:47.567
This convinces and ships more

01:56:47.634 --> 01:56:48.235
fishing effort into the ever

01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:49.903
increasing smaller areas that

01:56:49.970 --> 01:56:51.605
remain.

01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:53.607
We is fishermen in this state.

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:55.909
Utilize every last bit of these

01:56:55.976 --> 01:56:57.611
remaining areas.

01:56:57.677 --> 01:56:58.278
The bottom line is that we

01:56:58.345 --> 01:57:01.581
cannot afford to lose anymore

01:57:01.648 --> 01:57:02.282
essential fishing grounds.

01:57:02.349 --> 01:57:03.984
Fishermen are also worried about

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.585
a long list of potential and

01:57:05.652 --> 01:57:07.687
buyer environmental impacts most

01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:09.689
of which have already been

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:10.323
mentioned the previous panel.

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:11.825
We understand firsthand how

01:57:11.892 --> 01:57:13.760
harsh and unforgiving the ocean

01:57:13.827 --> 01:57:15.695
can be and are concerned about

01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:17.597
failures with the equipment or

01:57:17.664 --> 01:57:18.131
even the entire project in

01:57:18.198 --> 01:57:19.599
general.

01:57:19.666 --> 01:57:21.635
There's also an element of

01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:22.302
apprehension about the amount of

01:57:22.369 --> 01:57:23.904
electricity being generated in

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:25.805
its effects on the marine

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:29.609
environment.

01:57:29.676 --> 01:57:31.711
Yup sure win project also raises

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:33.647
many safety concerns the

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:34.314
proposed site for wind farm in

01:57:34.381 --> 01:57:35.982
Eureka is going to take away

01:57:36.049 --> 01:57:37.651
prime fishing grounds that are

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:39.586
critical to obtain due to these

01:57:39.653 --> 01:57:40.220
close.

01:57:40.287 --> 01:57:41.755
Due to be it being so closer

01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:43.623
proximity to port.

01:57:43.690 --> 01:57:44.224
It is also important to retain

01:57:44.291 --> 01:57:45.959
these local grounds reduce

01:57:46.026 --> 01:57:47.827
travel time in bad weather that

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:48.495
fishermen often face in northern

01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:51.631
California.

01:57:51.698 --> 01:57:52.332
They're also navigational

01:57:52.399 --> 01:57:53.900
concerns here in Eureka fishery

01:57:53.967 --> 01:57:55.702
must contend with a very

01:57:55.769 --> 01:57:56.336
dangerous bar to transit to and

01:57:56.403 --> 01:57:57.771
from the ocean.

01:57:57.837 --> 01:57:59.739
Increasing the amount of

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:00.407
consistent traffic with very

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:02.275
large maintenance vessels in a

01:58:02.342 --> 01:58:03.944
narrow area adds another element

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.812
of risk to safely pass.

01:58:05.879 --> 01:58:07.681
Not only the bar but the fleet

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:09.683
must also be careful transiting

01:58:09.749 --> 01:58:10.350
through the wind farm is there

01:58:10.417 --> 01:58:11.952
will now be many large

01:58:12.018 --> 01:58:12.552
obstructions we must avoid and

01:58:12.619 --> 01:58:15.722
Dodge.

01:58:15.789 --> 01:58:16.389
It will also increase traffic in

01:58:16.456 --> 01:58:18.124
areas with ships traveling the

01:58:18.191 --> 01:58:18.792
coast.

01:58:18.858 --> 01:58:20.226
These are more hazards that a

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:23.697
fisherman must face to provide a

01:58:23.763 --> 01:58:25.899
product that the public desires.

01:58:25.966 --> 01:58:27.701
Wild sustainably caught seafood

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:29.703
is considered to be the absolute

01:58:29.769 --> 01:58:30.270
best form of seafood on the

01:58:30.337 --> 01:58:31.738
planet.

01:58:31.805 --> 01:58:35.775
That we as fishermen strive to

01:58:35.842 --> 01:58:36.343
make these viable resources

01:58:36.409 --> 01:58:37.744
available.

01:58:37.811 --> 01:58:40.113
Yeah it really seems that we are

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.715
always under attack.

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:42.382
Whether it's environmental

01:58:42.449 --> 01:58:44.117
groups that fight to shut down

01:58:44.184 --> 01:58:45.719
these fisheries.

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:46.353
Or government agencies

01:58:46.419 --> 01:58:47.988
attempting to take away more

01:58:48.054 --> 01:58:49.723
fishing grounds.

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:51.891
Fishermen are always fighting to

01:58:51.958 --> 01:58:53.727
defend their livelihoods.

01:58:53.793 --> 01:58:54.327
The public relies on us to

01:58:54.394 --> 01:58:56.029
provide a wild sustainable

01:58:56.096 --> 01:58:59.733
product by means of fishing.

01:58:59.799 --> 01:59:00.300
And we rely on fishing for

01:59:00.367 --> 01:59:01.735
survival.

01:59:01.801 --> 01:59:03.703
Fishermen are not against

01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:05.739
renewable energy at all.

01:59:05.805 --> 01:59:07.707
But we are against permanently

01:59:07.774 --> 01:59:08.241
losing fishing opportunity

01:59:08.308 --> 01:59:08.575
[inaudible]

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:09.743
Thank you.

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:12.145
Thank you so much. For a great

01:59:12.212 --> 01:59:13.980
for now then turn the floor over

01:59:14.047 --> 01:59:14.648
to known Oppenheim the executive

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:16.082
director of the Pacific coast

01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:17.717
federation of fishermen's

01:59:17.784 --> 01:59:18.385
associations now welcome Sir.

01:59:18.451 --> 01:59:20.053
Thank you chair McGuire it's a

01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:21.955
pleasure to be here with you.

01:59:22.022 --> 01:59:23.823
The state of California and the

01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:24.491
people of the north and the

01:59:24.557 --> 01:59:26.159
central coast have a lot to be

01:59:26.226 --> 01:59:27.694
proud of in their commercial

01:59:27.761 --> 01:59:28.395
fishermen and when it.

01:59:28.461 --> 01:59:30.030
Our fisheries are among the most

01:59:30.096 --> 01:59:31.698
sustainable in the world and

01:59:31.765 --> 01:59:32.332
Fishman work tirelessly to

01:59:32.399 --> 01:59:34.000
ensure that the public trust

01:59:34.067 --> 01:59:35.902
resources that you the people

01:59:35.969 --> 01:59:37.871
right we own.

01:59:37.937 --> 01:59:39.706
There are the highest quality

01:59:39.773 --> 01:59:40.407
the revenues from the harvester

01:59:40.473 --> 01:59:42.142
shared for the public's benefit

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:43.777
and their bounty is available to

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:44.411
future generations of fishermen

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:46.112
and the public for ever.

01:59:46.179 --> 01:59:48.014
And the economic activity of our

01:59:48.081 --> 01:59:49.716
members and associates seafood

01:59:49.783 --> 01:59:50.417
businesses in addition to

01:59:50.483 --> 01:59:51.951
feeding the state and the world

01:59:52.018 --> 01:59:53.853
provide a hundred and twenty

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:54.521
four thousand eight hundred jobs

01:59:54.587 --> 01:59:56.022
at last count and over thirty

01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:57.857
five billion dollars of economic

01:59:57.924 --> 01:59:58.558
productivity that's in

01:59:58.625 --> 01:59:59.993
California alone according to a

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:00.660
department of commerce.

02:00:00.727 --> 02:00:02.162
Study clearly fisheries are an

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:04.164
important part of our coastal

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:06.099
renewable economy in California

02:00:06.166 --> 02:00:07.801
and threats to these existing

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:08.368
jobs in the families they

02:00:08.435 --> 02:00:09.936
support.

02:00:10.003 --> 02:00:10.537
Should be free we discuss in

02:00:10.603 --> 02:00:11.905
forums like this so.

02:00:11.971 --> 02:00:14.107
Thank you for the opportunity.

02:00:14.174 --> 02:00:15.909
Our state likewise takes pride

02:00:15.975 --> 02:00:16.543
its ingenuity and the proactive

02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:18.211
work that we take to reduce

02:00:18.278 --> 02:00:19.979
carbon emissions we also take

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:21.948
pride in social justice in the

02:00:22.015 --> 02:00:22.549
equity bill any of our major

02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:24.050
projects and initiatives.

02:00:24.117 --> 02:00:25.885
This become of renewed focus of

02:00:25.952 --> 02:00:27.821
the new some administration in

02:00:27.887 --> 02:00:28.488
for example the distribution of

02:00:28.555 --> 02:00:30.023
our scarce water resources.

02:00:30.090 --> 02:00:31.925
And for that we're grateful it's

02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:33.960
in the spirit of that of of

02:00:34.027 --> 02:00:34.661
equity billeted at the Pacific

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:36.096
coast federation of fishermen's

02:00:36.162 --> 02:00:37.831
associations has been working

02:00:37.897 --> 02:00:39.833
proactively to defend the rights

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:40.533
of our members.

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:42.168
And operate -- Imply their craft

02:00:42.235 --> 02:00:44.070
in the context of wind energy

02:00:44.137 --> 02:00:45.839
development off shore.

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:50.143
The state in the north coast

02:00:50.210 --> 02:00:51.811
regions -- And the central coast

02:00:51.878 --> 02:00:52.512
regions are poised to enter the

02:00:52.579 --> 02:00:53.113
Brave New World of offshore wind

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:53.847
energy.

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:54.514
If we don't take care if we

02:00:54.581 --> 02:00:55.215
don't learn from the mistakes

02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:56.149
made in other parts of the U. S.

02:00:56.216 --> 02:00:57.817
and other countries we will lose

02:00:57.884 --> 02:01:02.021
a real opportunity to get this

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:03.857
right the first time.

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:06.059
Climate change and ocean warming

02:01:06.126 --> 02:01:06.726
impacts the fisheries have been

02:01:06.793 --> 02:01:07.393
numerous insignificant already

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.094
from shifting fish population

02:01:08.161 --> 02:01:08.762
distributions to closures caused

02:01:08.828 --> 02:01:09.929
by harmful algal blooms these

02:01:09.996 --> 02:01:11.831
changes have been unpredictable

02:01:11.898 --> 02:01:12.432
and sometimes extraordinarily

02:01:12.499 --> 02:01:14.100
costly even tragic.

02:01:14.167 --> 02:01:15.969
In addition to these climate

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:17.837
impacts regulatory and spatial

02:01:17.904 --> 02:01:18.538
constraints of severely

02:01:18.605 --> 02:01:20.006
constrained commercial fisheries

02:01:20.073 --> 02:01:21.841
costing our members dearly.

02:01:21.908 --> 02:01:23.810
The impacts the commercial

02:01:23.877 --> 02:01:24.511
fishing industry resulting from

02:01:24.577 --> 02:01:25.912
the development of offshore wind

02:01:25.979 --> 02:01:27.814
resources are likewise numerous

02:01:27.881 --> 02:01:28.381
insignificant from spatial

02:01:28.448 --> 02:01:29.983
displacement the gear

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:31.818
concentration to business

02:01:31.885 --> 02:01:34.053
disruption interruption to

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:34.754
impacts to safety transit.

02:01:34.821 --> 02:01:36.322
And logistical impacts to shore

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:37.857
side operations.

02:01:37.924 --> 02:01:38.458
From the fishing industries

02:01:38.525 --> 02:01:40.093
perspective offshore wind

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.128
development is equivalent to

02:01:42.195 --> 02:01:42.796
eminent domain.

02:01:42.862 --> 02:01:44.264
It's crystal clear to us that

02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:45.932
the fishing industry that

02:01:45.999 --> 02:01:47.901
offshore wind area --

02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:50.136
Development equates to closed

02:01:50.203 --> 02:01:50.803
areas.

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:52.138
There's been the beneficiaries

02:01:52.205 --> 02:01:53.907
of these closures will be

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:54.541
corporate entities foreign and

02:01:54.607 --> 02:01:56.142
domestic to sell power to

02:01:56.209 --> 02:01:57.877
consumers for profit.

02:01:57.944 --> 02:02:00.013
It's the transfer of assets and

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:00.680
resources from one space

02:02:00.747 --> 02:02:02.182
intensive ocean user group to

02:02:02.248 --> 02:02:04.317
another in simple this is the

02:02:04.384 --> 02:02:06.352
set of trade offs like any other

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:08.087
eminent domain process.

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:10.056
It's a choice for society and

02:02:10.123 --> 02:02:12.025
for our leaders to make let's

02:02:12.091 --> 02:02:14.027
make wise choices.

02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:14.694
It's also clear to us that these

02:02:14.761 --> 02:02:16.029
call areas beacons being

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:17.997
considered here today are just

02:02:18.064 --> 02:02:18.698
the beginning. Thirty gigawatts

02:02:18.765 --> 02:02:20.266
of generation and the result and

02:02:20.333 --> 02:02:22.368
displacement of most commercial

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:24.170
fishing activity off our coast

02:02:24.237 --> 02:02:26.105
appear to be the goal post where

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:26.773
could contemplating here today.

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:27.974
That's frightening to many.

02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:30.343
We hear a lot about compensation

02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:31.945
to fishermen in the in these

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:32.645
conversations disruption

02:02:32.712 --> 02:02:34.380
payments D. impacted businesses

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:35.949
will certainly be appropriate

02:02:36.015 --> 02:02:36.649
down the road.

02:02:36.716 --> 02:02:38.218
If wind projects and cables are

02:02:38.284 --> 02:02:40.320
installed in the U. S. easy in

02:02:40.386 --> 02:02:42.155
our coastal waters we have a lot

02:02:42.222 --> 02:02:43.957
of work to do first.

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:44.591
If offshore wind projects are

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:46.326
not appropriate for certain

02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:48.094
areas of the coast based on

02:02:48.161 --> 02:02:49.929
impacts of fisheries or under

02:02:49.996 --> 02:02:51.931
the cesium a consistency process

02:02:51.998 --> 02:02:53.933
we end the wind history industry

02:02:53.1000 --> 02:02:55.935
need to know this before leasing

02:02:56.002 --> 02:02:56.569
takes place.

02:02:56.636 --> 02:02:58.037
The outer continental shelf

02:02:58.104 --> 02:02:58.705
lands act and the national

02:02:58.771 --> 02:03:00.139
environmental policy act or to

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:02.041
broad legal frameworks that

02:03:02.108 --> 02:03:02.675
require significant analyses

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:04.143
when development impacts to

02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:06.212
commercial fisheries among

02:03:06.279 --> 02:03:06.846
others.

02:03:06.913 --> 02:03:08.381
But because Boeing maintains

02:03:08.448 --> 02:03:10.216
that it is not reasonably

02:03:10.283 --> 02:03:12.352
foreseeable that wind of element

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:14.120
will result from wind energy

02:03:14.187 --> 02:03:14.754
leasing the full environmental

02:03:14.821 --> 02:03:16.256
scoping process including

02:03:16.322 --> 02:03:18.358
economic analyses will not take

02:03:18.424 --> 02:03:20.193
place until after tens of

02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:20.894
millions of dollars.

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:22.495
Poured into purchasing leases in

02:03:22.562 --> 02:03:23.963
engineering studies.

02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:26.232
This is backwards in my opinion.

02:03:26.299 --> 02:03:28.034
The fishing industry knows what

02:03:28.101 --> 02:03:28.735
these impacts are there will not

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.169
be fishing in wind energy areas

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:32.272
we can begin the scoping process

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:34.040
now we're grateful that after

02:03:34.107 --> 02:03:34.741
years of that because he we are

02:03:34.807 --> 02:03:36.309
starting to see the foundations

02:03:36.376 --> 02:03:38.311
of economic studies taking
shape.

02:03:38.378 --> 02:03:40.179
We need to look beyond single

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:41.948
studies and focus on developing

02:03:42.015 --> 02:03:42.615
consortia to address specific

02:03:42.682 --> 02:03:44.284
questions fishing communities

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:46.185
and when developers are starting

02:03:46.252 --> 02:03:46.853
to engage tackle these

02:03:46.919 --> 02:03:48.288
information challenges on the

02:03:48.354 --> 02:03:49.989
east coast.

02:03:50.056 --> 02:03:52.558
We could take a page from their

02:03:52.625 --> 02:03:53.159
book here.

02:03:53.226 --> 02:03:53.960
We also need to scope the

02:03:54.027 --> 02:03:54.627
indirect impacts the commercial

02:03:54.694 --> 02:03:56.162
fisheries appropriately there

02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:58.097
are many scientific questions

02:03:58.164 --> 02:03:58.698
that remain unanswered.

02:03:58.765 --> 02:04:00.233
That must be it answer by

02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:02.201
agencies developers before we'd

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:04.103
sell these facilities we need to

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:04.804
know whether floating when

02:04:04.871 --> 02:04:06.239
structures aggregate fish stocks

02:04:06.306 --> 02:04:08.041
result reducing access and

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:08.708
fisheries productivity we need

02:04:08.775 --> 02:04:10.176
to know.

02:04:10.243 --> 02:04:10.877
What the loss of federal fish

02:04:10.944 --> 02:04:12.445
population survey stations will

02:04:12.512 --> 02:04:14.480
mean for our stock assessments

02:04:14.547 --> 02:04:16.249
and what management constraints

02:04:16.316 --> 02:04:18.051
we can expect from uncertainty

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:18.718
being injected into the federal

02:04:18.785 --> 02:04:20.219
management process?

02:04:20.286 --> 02:04:22.121
We need to know about impacts to

02:04:22.188 --> 02:04:24.157
radar and other navigation tools

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:26.059
we do there's no not only about

02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:26.626
what impacts these projects

02:04:26.693 --> 02:04:28.094
would have to sensitive.

02:04:28.161 --> 02:04:30.163
And yes a listed species what

02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.863
those impacts convene for

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:34.067
commercial fisheries that those

02:04:34.133 --> 02:04:36.069
same species already
constrained.

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:36.736
We are heartened to hear that

02:04:36.803 --> 02:04:37.437
the state agencies working on

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:38.371
this process are already working

02:04:38.438 --> 02:04:40.039
on many of these coping

02:04:40.106 --> 02:04:40.707
questions in our industry will

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:42.375
be a good faith partner these

02:04:42.442 --> 02:04:43.076
efforts.

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:44.377
We have a lot of pride of faith

02:04:44.444 --> 02:04:46.179
in California's CZ M. A.

02:04:46.245 --> 02:04:48.147
consistency process and we will

02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:48.815
not accept federal rollbacks of

02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:50.483
our because the commission's

02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:51.150
authority to enforce the coastal

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:52.452
act thirty seconds we are

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:54.420
obviously -- We all obviously

02:04:54.487 --> 02:04:56.522
have a lot of work to do to get

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:57.190
this right.

02:04:57.256 --> 02:04:58.524
And I look forward to working

02:04:58.591 --> 02:05:00.293
with you senator and many of

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.261
those here in the room as we

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:02.962
move forward thank you.

02:05:03.029 --> 02:05:04.530
Thank you so much seven I'm very

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:06.399
grateful we'll have some a

02:05:06.466 --> 02:05:08.468
follow up in just a bit were so

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:10.236
appreciate any Hawkins is here

02:05:10.303 --> 02:05:12.338
she's the exact address for the

02:05:12.405 --> 02:05:12.905
response fostered about an

02:05:12.972 --> 02:05:14.107
alliance.

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:16.142
Sagas the floor is yours you

02:05:16.209 --> 02:05:16.809
have five minutes and give you

02:05:16.876 --> 02:05:18.077
thirty second problem welcome.

02:05:18.144 --> 02:05:18.778
Thank you and thanks so much for

02:05:18.845 --> 02:05:20.446
inviting me to beautiful Eureka

02:05:20.513 --> 02:05:22.281
that's a nice -- Diversion for

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:24.283
me from the usual D. C. life in

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:24.984
the east coast so angrily

02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:30.390
rejected it the weather is like

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:32.091
this every day hi.

02:05:32.158 --> 02:05:34.594
Yeah I've been here before.

02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:38.097
Yeah.

02:05:38.164 --> 02:05:38.765
Okay so -- My name is Anne

02:05:38.831 --> 02:05:40.433
Hawkins and I'm the executive

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.068
director of the responsible off

02:05:42.135 --> 02:05:42.668
shore development alliance or

02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:43.369
Rhoda.

02:05:43.436 --> 02:05:44.370
Which is based in Washington DC

02:05:44.437 --> 02:05:45.038
road is a membership based

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:46.372
coalition of fishing industry

02:05:46.439 --> 02:05:46.873
associations and fishing

02:05:46.939 --> 02:05:47.540
companies.

02:05:47.607 --> 02:05:48.408
With an interest in improving

02:05:48.474 --> 02:05:49.108
the compatibility of new

02:05:49.175 --> 02:05:50.476
offshore development with their

02:05:50.543 --> 02:05:51.144
business sense.

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:52.178
We currently have members from

02:05:52.245 --> 02:05:54.113
Maine to North Carolina.

02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:54.814
On we provide a strength in

02:05:54.881 --> 02:05:56.582
numbers approach to coordinating

02:05:56.649 --> 02:05:57.250
science and policy initiatives

02:05:57.316 --> 02:05:58.351
to minimize conflicts between

02:05:58.418 --> 02:06:00.319
traditional and historic
fishing.

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:02.455
And other uses of the outer

02:06:02.522 --> 02:06:03.089
continental shelf which as we

02:06:03.156 --> 02:06:04.323
know are increasing rapidly.

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:06.459
I mean today's has money I'm

02:06:06.526 --> 02:06:07.160
gonna focus primarily on

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.594
offshore when leasing process --

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:10.530
Mike happy right more

02:06:10.596 --> 02:06:11.197
information on environmental

02:06:11.264 --> 02:06:12.532
impacts the glass panel cover

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:13.199
that well.

02:06:13.266 --> 02:06:14.467
And then I did submit a letter

02:06:14.534 --> 02:06:16.469
for the record -- That we that

02:06:16.536 --> 02:06:20.406
showing some of our concerns

02:06:20.473 --> 02:06:22.275
with environmental impacts. One

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:24.177
of the biggest obstacles rodas

02:06:24.243 --> 02:06:24.844
attempted to overcome is a lack

02:06:24.911 --> 02:06:25.445
of information incorrect

02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:26.446
information about offshore

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:28.214
development plans.

02:06:28.281 --> 02:06:28.881
And the fact that they may or

02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:30.583
may not have on fisheries note

02:06:30.650 --> 02:06:32.418
ocean ecosystems. To be clear

02:06:32.485 --> 02:06:33.119
him anyways offshore wind energy

02:06:33.186 --> 02:06:34.454
development and sustainable

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.389
commercial fishing are directly

02:06:36.456 --> 02:06:38.191
conflicting activities.

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:40.159
Unfortunately on the east coast

02:06:40.226 --> 02:06:40.827
the rapid pace of offshore wind

02:06:40.893 --> 02:06:41.527
development and the failure to

02:06:41.594 --> 02:06:42.595
engage and transparent in early

02:06:42.662 --> 02:06:44.163
engagement with fishing

02:06:44.230 --> 02:06:44.831
communities.

02:06:44.897 --> 02:06:46.165
Has led to leasing in project

02:06:46.232 --> 02:06:46.833
design decisions being made

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.568
without effectively minimizing

02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:50.369
impacts our stork sustainable

02:06:50.436 --> 02:06:52.205
commercial fisheries.

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:52.905
Proper consideration of fishing

02:06:52.972 --> 02:06:54.574
practices and management takes a

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:56.209
significant amount of time.

02:06:56.275 --> 02:06:58.444
Often fishermen regulators are

02:06:58.511 --> 02:06:59.045
being asked to provide

02:06:59.111 --> 02:07:00.446
information for purposes.

02:07:00.513 --> 02:07:02.615
And on special skills that I've

02:07:02.682 --> 02:07:03.316
never had manager relevance

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:04.650
before so these data collection

02:07:04.717 --> 02:07:08.187
analytical intimate activities

02:07:08.254 --> 02:07:08.788
can take months or even years

02:07:08.855 --> 02:07:10.223
together right.

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:12.391
The opportunities for public

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:13.092
input leasing process alone do

02:07:13.159 --> 02:07:14.594
not occur often enough for early

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:16.596
enough to allow for meaningful

02:07:16.662 --> 02:07:18.197
cooperation to reduce conflicts.

02:07:18.264 --> 02:07:20.600
Fishermen must never be seen as

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:24.303
merely a stakeholder in the

02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:26.172
anything off showing developers

02:07:26.239 --> 02:07:26.739
are simply the newest

02:07:26.806 --> 02:07:28.374
stakeholders to our into

02:07:28.441 --> 02:07:30.176
California centuries old fishing

02:07:30.243 --> 02:07:30.776
industry which provides the

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.578
state with your place will

02:07:32.645 --> 02:07:34.413
benefits jobs revenue food

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.415
security tourism recreation.

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:38.451
Actual males on dinner plates

02:07:38.518 --> 02:07:40.386
traditional ecological
knowledge.

02:07:40.453 --> 02:07:44.190
And a significant contribution

02:07:44.257 --> 02:07:46.225
to the states for a dining.

02:07:46.292 --> 02:07:46.926
Sirota form last summer to

02:07:46.993 --> 02:07:48.261
better amplified the concerns of

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:48.928
commercial fishermen and to

02:07:48.995 --> 02:07:50.463
better include their expansive

02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:52.431
knowledge and talk show in

02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:53.132
development process.

02:07:53.199 --> 02:07:54.300
And in some ways we found pretty

02:07:54.367 --> 02:07:56.402
receptive audiences -- To that

02:07:56.469 --> 02:07:57.103
and we recently signed a ten

02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:58.671
year memorandum of understanding

02:07:58.738 --> 02:08:00.740
with national marine fisheries

02:08:00.806 --> 02:08:02.742
service and the bureau of ocean

02:08:02.808 --> 02:08:04.410
energy management -- To

02:08:04.477 --> 02:08:08.281
communicate fisheries import

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:08.948
better into the leasing process.

02:08:09.015 --> 02:08:10.449
And Oregon scientific products

02:08:10.516 --> 02:08:12.451
to better consider fisheries

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:14.687
impacts -- So through that M. O.

02:08:14.754 --> 02:08:15.388
U. we've been able to work more

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:16.722
closely alongside our government

02:08:16.789 --> 02:08:18.424
partners more often in the

02:08:18.491 --> 02:08:19.058
process -- To enable us to

02:08:19.125 --> 02:08:20.660
educate our fishing industry

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:21.260
membership.

02:08:21.327 --> 02:08:22.628
Project development and to

02:08:22.695 --> 02:08:24.530
provide feedback to both names

02:08:24.597 --> 02:08:26.699
embalmer guarding the industry's

02:08:26.766 --> 02:08:28.334
concerns.

02:08:28.401 --> 02:08:29.035
We've also found it useful to

02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:30.703
work with wind energy developers

02:08:30.770 --> 02:08:32.438
directly -- We've invited

02:08:32.505 --> 02:08:33.139
currently holding developers to

02:08:33.206 --> 02:08:34.740
a joint industry task force that

02:08:34.807 --> 02:08:36.342
we formed on the east coast. To

02:08:36.409 --> 02:08:37.043
tackle some of the most

02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:38.511
difficult conflict areas between

02:08:38.578 --> 02:08:40.313
the two industries.

02:08:40.379 --> 02:08:42.348
Working directly together --

02:08:42.415 --> 02:08:43.049
Will help identify best

02:08:43.115 --> 02:08:44.684
practices for up showing proper

02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:46.352
projects and provide a forum to

02:08:46.419 --> 02:08:48.354
drive innovative problem solving
--

02:08:48.421 --> 02:08:50.556
The state and California

02:08:50.623 --> 02:08:52.391
leaseholder shin braces club

02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:53.059
reproach as well -- We find that

02:08:53.125 --> 02:08:54.360
there's a lot of room for

02:08:54.427 --> 02:08:55.027
innovation when people actually

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:56.362
talk about what's happening on

02:08:56.429 --> 02:08:56.996
the water they might not come

02:08:57.063 --> 02:08:58.731
out through the through the

02:08:58.798 --> 02:09:00.333
leasing process.

02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:04.370
A couple of houses Spokane to

02:09:04.437 --> 02:09:05.004
mitigation -- On the east coast

02:09:05.071 --> 02:09:06.572
aggressive state renewable

02:09:06.639 --> 02:09:08.474
energy procurement goals --

02:09:08.541 --> 02:09:10.309
Drive after when markets which

02:09:10.376 --> 02:09:10.943
is a little different from here

02:09:11.010 --> 02:09:12.545
I understand -- And at that

02:09:12.612 --> 02:09:14.280
opens the door to variable

02:09:14.347 --> 02:09:16.449
purchase to medication and to

02:09:16.515 --> 02:09:18.284
destruction payments -- Among

02:09:18.351 --> 02:09:18.918
projects among areas.

02:09:18.985 --> 02:09:20.653
These discussions first and

02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:22.588
foremost need to be transparent

02:09:22.655 --> 02:09:24.557
and inclusive it is absolutely

02:09:24.624 --> 02:09:25.224
imperative that fisheries

02:09:25.291 --> 02:09:28.628
mitigation follows a step wise

02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:30.329
approach.

02:09:30.396 --> 02:09:31.030
First to avoid impacts they some

02:09:31.097 --> 02:09:32.565
possible second to minimize any

02:09:32.632 --> 02:09:33.132
accent absolutely can't be

02:09:33.199 --> 02:09:34.433
avoided.

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:36.302
Then to mitigate any residual

02:09:36.369 --> 02:09:36.902
impacts appropriate spatial

02:09:36.969 --> 02:09:38.704
seasonal or technological

02:09:38.771 --> 02:09:40.840
controls and then and only then

02:09:40.906 --> 02:09:42.475
once those steps have been

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:43.175
followed.

02:09:43.242 --> 02:09:44.644
Consider disruption payments for

02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:46.445
fisheries losses.

02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:48.481
Since the beginning of offer

02:09:48.547 --> 02:09:49.115
when development projects or

02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:50.483
spend the recognition of the

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:52.385
need for regional science body

02:09:52.451 --> 02:09:53.052
to address research and

02:09:53.119 --> 02:09:54.387
monitoring needs for fisheries

02:09:54.453 --> 02:09:56.422
offshore wind interactions.

02:09:56.489 --> 02:09:57.089
Not just on a project specific

02:09:57.156 --> 02:09:58.624
level but to understand

02:09:58.691 --> 02:10:00.393
ecosystem impacts from the large

02:10:00.459 --> 02:10:01.060
scale installation of these new

02:10:01.127 --> 02:10:02.428
industrial projects.

02:10:02.495 --> 02:10:04.397
As well as the cumulative

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:08.401
impacts of Malta police sites --

02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:09.035
The relationship that wrote it

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:10.403
has bill with government

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:10.970
agencies now for wind energy

02:10:11.037 --> 02:10:11.671
developers.

02:10:11.737 --> 02:10:12.905
Has allowed us to assist in the

02:10:12.972 --> 02:10:14.707
formation of a new five oh one

02:10:14.774 --> 02:10:16.542
C. three at the response washer

02:10:16.609 --> 02:10:18.678
science alliance a rose up just

02:10:18.744 --> 02:10:20.613
affiliated -- Which is a

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.314
collaborative effort among

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:22.415
fishing industry representatives

02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:23.115
offer when developers and state

02:10:23.182 --> 02:10:24.950
and federal government agencies.

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:26.852
We're working to increase alien

02:10:26.919 --> 02:10:28.721
incredible data on fisheries and

02:10:28.788 --> 02:10:30.589
when development and to increase

02:10:30.656 --> 02:10:31.257
the understanding the effects of

02:10:31.324 --> 02:10:32.458
wind energy development on

02:10:32.525 --> 02:10:33.125
fisheries and the ocean eco

02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:34.794
systems on which they depend.

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.495
Thirty seconds California must

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:38.531
similarly develop and support

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:39.198
collaborative and initiatives to

02:10:39.265 --> 02:10:40.399
increase scientific

02:10:40.466 --> 02:10:40.900
understanding research

02:10:40.966 --> 02:10:42.435
monitoring.

02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:43.102
Which is paramount to achieving

02:10:43.169 --> 02:10:44.437
future co existence.

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:46.639
We found a road on the hope to

02:10:46.706 --> 02:10:47.273
minimize the divide and conquer

02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:48.774
approach to interacting with

02:10:48.841 --> 02:10:50.409
commercial fishermen and rapidly

02:10:50.476 --> 02:10:51.077
developing ocean.

02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:52.712
Our successes of come from our

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:53.379
ability to collaborate with

02:10:53.446 --> 02:10:54.747
fishermen and fishing related

02:10:54.814 --> 02:10:56.916
businesses will be affected by

02:10:56.982 --> 02:10:57.616
wind energy.

02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:58.818
Fishermen hold a broad range of

02:10:58.884 --> 02:11:00.586
beliefs and approaches to their

02:11:00.653 --> 02:11:01.187
interactions with other ocean

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:02.788
users but they're also the

02:11:02.855 --> 02:11:03.456
single best source of

02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:04.757
information about the offshore

02:11:04.824 --> 02:11:06.559
environment.

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:07.259
This information has to be

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:08.427
brought to bear and constructive

02:11:08.494 --> 02:11:09.061
in time appropriate manner in

02:11:09.128 --> 02:11:10.730
order to ensure that one

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:12.398
renewable resources and

02:11:12.465 --> 02:11:16.702
developed at the expense of

02:11:16.769 --> 02:11:20.439
another thank you.

02:11:20.506 --> 02:11:21.140
Thank you so much nice work

02:11:21.207 --> 02:11:22.708
really grateful would like me to

02:11:22.775 --> 02:11:23.342
open up for questions if it

02:11:23.409 --> 02:11:24.443
works for the three of you.

02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:25.077
Would like me to start with

02:11:25.144 --> 02:11:26.912
Dropbox tell us about -- You

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:28.781
know we heard that that the

02:11:28.848 --> 02:11:30.483
association is in M. O. U. --

02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:32.618
With printable power don't wanna

02:11:32.685 --> 02:11:33.319
say get into the exact details

02:11:33.386 --> 02:11:34.954
M. O. U. but what are you trying

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:38.624
to be able to accomplish to be

02:11:38.691 --> 02:11:40.593
able to protect the fleet --

02:11:40.659 --> 02:11:41.260
Well I've always like that

02:11:41.327 --> 02:11:42.895
saying -- If you don't have a

02:11:42.962 --> 02:11:43.596
seat at the table you're on the

02:11:43.662 --> 02:11:44.597
menu yeah but I think that when

02:11:44.663 --> 02:11:45.297
it comes to offshore wind energy

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:46.665
with commercial fishermen -- We

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:48.901
are trying to make is that we do

02:11:48.968 --> 02:11:50.536
have a seat at the table.

02:11:50.603 --> 02:11:51.203
But we are always going to be on

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:52.605
the menu.

02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:56.509
Yeah in you talked about losing

02:11:56.575 --> 02:11:58.611
valuable ground right -- That

02:11:58.677 --> 02:12:00.746
would otherwise be utilized for

02:12:00.813 --> 02:12:02.548
commercial fishing.

02:12:02.615 --> 02:12:03.215
If you wanna talk about any of

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:04.750
the other specific concerns to

02:12:04.817 --> 02:12:06.852
humble -- That we should be

02:12:06.919 --> 02:12:08.854
aware of that we should be

02:12:08.921 --> 02:12:12.558
looking at as we move forward.

02:12:12.625 --> 02:12:12.858
All.

02:12:12.925 --> 02:12:14.560
I mean.

02:12:14.627 --> 02:12:15.194
Like I stated and in my

02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:16.796
testimony -- There's so many

02:12:16.862 --> 02:12:18.964
closures already in California.

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:20.966
We've just been bottlenecked

02:12:21.033 --> 02:12:22.968
into all of these other confined

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:24.570
areas.

02:12:24.637 --> 02:12:26.672
And if we take away more grounds

02:12:26.739 --> 02:12:28.541
hundred square miles of area.

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:29.208
I mean all we're doing is

02:12:29.275 --> 02:12:30.910
pushing us further and further

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:32.711
in contention as work it's

02:12:32.778 --> 02:12:34.713
efforts shifted into smaller and

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:35.314
smaller areas.

02:12:35.381 --> 02:12:36.982
So all over ground is very

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:38.984
valuable it doesn't matter if we

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:40.820
were to move it to the north or

02:12:40.886 --> 02:12:41.520
moved to the south.

02:12:41.587 --> 02:12:44.623
The bottom line is that we can't

02:12:44.690 --> 02:12:46.559
afford to lose anymore grounds.

02:12:46.625 --> 02:12:48.594
The challenges and one of the

02:12:48.661 --> 02:12:49.295
boards your mouth is the

02:12:49.361 --> 02:12:49.962
cumulative impact of what you've

02:12:50.029 --> 02:12:50.729
seen over the past many years

02:12:50.796 --> 02:12:54.633
with -- Closures with -- Areas

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:56.869
that are now off limits except

02:12:56.936 --> 02:12:57.503
raise that would that be

02:12:57.570 --> 02:13:00.539
accurate yes okay thank you

02:13:00.606 --> 02:13:01.240
thank you very much would like

02:13:01.307 --> 02:13:03.042
me to go to miss Hawkins -- Can

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:04.543
you give us a rundown of best

02:13:04.610 --> 02:13:05.211
practices that you've heard of

02:13:05.277 --> 02:13:06.779
it that you've seen in that

02:13:06.846 --> 02:13:08.781
you've implemented -- And then

02:13:08.848 --> 02:13:10.716
any lessons learned that would

02:13:10.783 --> 02:13:12.518
be good for all of us to hear

02:13:12.585 --> 02:13:13.152
about especially as we go

02:13:13.219 --> 02:13:14.954
forward with his burgeoning

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:15.521
industry.

02:13:15.588 --> 02:13:20.860
Sure so in terms of best

02:13:20.926 --> 02:13:22.828
practices it's can this is

02:13:22.895 --> 02:13:23.495
surely give you a run down

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:25.030
because we're still working on

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:26.732
them I mean sure so a lot of

02:13:26.799 --> 02:13:30.669
ways to go all right -- The
lane.

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:32.671
For sure -- I mean.

02:13:32.738 --> 02:13:33.272
Like I said it's it's getting

02:13:33.339 --> 02:13:34.874
the industry's together is

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:35.541
getting the fishing industry to

02:13:35.608 --> 02:13:36.775
the table early and often and

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:38.744
not just to check a box not just

02:13:38.811 --> 02:13:39.445
you know we've we've.

02:13:39.512 --> 02:13:41.080
Heard here today you know we've

02:13:41.146 --> 02:13:41.780
had any meetings we've heard on

02:13:41.847 --> 02:13:42.915
these guys about a hundred fifty

02:13:42.982 --> 02:13:43.616
meetings on this project.

02:13:43.682 --> 02:13:46.685
But fishermen don't know where.

02:13:46.752 --> 02:13:47.319
Where their input is best given

02:13:47.386 --> 02:13:48.821
into the process they're not

02:13:48.888 --> 02:13:49.488
gonna bring that information

02:13:49.555 --> 02:13:50.723
effectively -- And a lot of it

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:51.423
has to be driven by the fishing

02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:52.725
industry is should not ever feel

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:53.325
like something that's being

02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:54.693
imposed on one industry by

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:55.361
another.

02:13:55.427 --> 02:13:57.029
If the truth if the culturally

02:13:57.096 --> 02:14:00.766
as to to work together -- It's

02:14:00.833 --> 02:14:01.367
really you know.

02:14:01.433 --> 02:14:02.968
Co exist or are being more

02:14:03.035 --> 02:14:05.037
compatible -- So I would say you

02:14:05.104 --> 02:14:07.106
know is start everything early

02:14:07.172 --> 02:14:08.774
start your economics impacts

02:14:08.841 --> 02:14:10.743
studies early start your

02:14:10.809 --> 02:14:12.811
ecological surveys early you

02:14:12.878 --> 02:14:14.947
know now if you if you know

02:14:15.014 --> 02:14:15.614
what's coming now.

02:14:15.681 --> 02:14:17.082
Start working on it now -- And

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:18.918
don't wait until you know you've

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:20.786
got the short deadlines with a

02:14:20.853 --> 02:14:22.688
with the permitting process.

02:14:22.755 --> 02:14:23.322
You mentioned thank you -- You

02:14:23.389 --> 02:14:24.990
mention -- There were some

02:14:25.057 --> 02:14:30.796
conflict areas -- That had

02:14:30.863 --> 02:14:32.665
started to evolve.

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:33.332
What can we learn here in the

02:14:33.399 --> 02:14:34.934
Golden State about what you're

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:35.401
seeing is conflicts?

02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:36.669
Back east.

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:37.336
What can I mean there's a lot of

02:14:37.403 --> 02:14:38.771
specific ones in sort of more

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:39.438
general once I mean one one

02:14:39.505 --> 02:14:41.073
thing that comes to mind that

02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:42.775
that's really obvious one is

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:44.643
that the first few -- Leases

02:14:44.710 --> 02:14:45.311
that were issued on the east

02:14:45.377 --> 02:14:46.979
coast were issued without any

02:14:47.046 --> 02:14:48.781
consideration of fishing vessel

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:50.649
transit so even if you assume

02:14:50.716 --> 02:14:51.350
that there is gonna be closer to

02:14:51.417 --> 02:14:52.685
finishing.

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:53.385
You know you have people that

02:14:53.452 --> 02:14:54.086
are going to fishing grounds on

02:14:54.153 --> 02:14:55.054
other on the other side how are

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:56.755
they going to get through that

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:58.724
array and and in New England we

02:14:58.791 --> 02:15:00.659
have a fourteen hundred square

02:15:00.726 --> 02:15:02.695
mile complex now.

02:15:02.761 --> 02:15:03.395
Lee says that just keep going on

02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:04.697
to each other.

02:15:04.763 --> 02:15:06.665
You know for fishermen on

02:15:06.732 --> 02:15:08.801
lobster boat across fourteen

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:09.501
hundred square miles is no joke

02:15:09.568 --> 02:15:11.036
right -- But once the developer

02:15:11.103 --> 02:15:12.972
holds a lease and has developed

02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:16.642
the their their pricing and send

02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:17.276
the procurement contracts with

02:15:17.343 --> 02:15:18.944
the state -- It becomes very

02:15:19.011 --> 02:15:19.611
difficult for them to remove

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:21.080
rows of turbines to allow for

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:22.748
fishing vessel access that

02:15:22.815 --> 02:15:23.449
should have been written into

02:15:23.515 --> 02:15:24.817
the lease that should have been

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:25.484
done up front.

02:15:25.551 --> 02:15:26.785
And now we're starting to one

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:27.453
that that's the type of thing

02:15:27.519 --> 02:15:28.954
that you can look up a friend

02:15:29.021 --> 02:15:29.622
there's a lot of other examples

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:33.258
like that but that's that's a

02:15:33.325 --> 02:15:36.695
pretty good.

02:15:36.762 --> 02:15:38.831
One that said thank you. For the

02:15:38.897 --> 02:15:40.866
valuable feedback on night.

02:15:40.933 --> 02:15:42.835
Thanks very good M. shopping

02:15:42.901 --> 02:15:45.170
hime -- It is about how you like

02:15:45.237 --> 02:15:45.838
to be a C. a formal process

02:15:45.904 --> 02:15:47.139
develop -- That would include

02:15:47.206 --> 02:15:47.773
the fleet -- Here in the months

02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:48.841
and years to come.

02:15:48.907 --> 02:15:51.110
That's a critically important

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:51.777
question obviously.

02:15:51.844 --> 02:15:55.047
The I I think engagement with

02:15:55.114 --> 02:15:58.851
the the OPC.

02:15:58.917 --> 02:15:59.385
Social protection.

02:15:59.451 --> 02:16:00.886
Cancel end the coastal

02:16:00.953 --> 02:16:02.821
commission are the places to

02:16:02.888 --> 02:16:04.823
start I think we we need to

02:16:04.890 --> 02:16:06.792
start.

02:16:06.859 --> 02:16:08.894
Taking the initiative here in

02:16:08.961 --> 02:16:11.096
California -- Start having stir

02:16:11.163 --> 02:16:12.831
creating a forum for

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:14.833
conversations with the the

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:18.771
developers the wind industry --

02:16:18.837 --> 02:16:21.073
Who also are seeking certainty

02:16:21.140 --> 02:16:22.775
in the space I I completely

02:16:22.841 --> 02:16:24.910
understand that -- That that's

02:16:24.977 --> 02:16:26.845
the model it's clearly the one

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:27.513
that's demonstrating the

02:16:27.579 --> 02:16:29.114
greatest degree of success on

02:16:29.181 --> 02:16:30.949
the east coast -- And we are

02:16:31.016 --> 02:16:32.818
we're taking the baby steps now

02:16:32.885 --> 02:16:34.820
but without question our

02:16:34.887 --> 02:16:36.855
organization the Pacific coast

02:16:36.922 --> 02:16:37.389
federation of fishermen's

02:16:37.456 --> 02:16:38.757
associations the local

02:16:38.824 --> 02:16:39.425
associations closest and

02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:42.995
proximity. To the wind energy

02:16:43.062 --> 02:16:44.863
call areas and other

02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:48.834
associations of fishermen who do

02:16:48.901 --> 02:16:49.501
operate in these areas as well

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:50.903
the to be at the table we've.

02:16:50.969 --> 02:16:53.105
Started on our industry side to

02:16:53.172 --> 02:16:55.240
have those conversations they'll

02:16:55.307 --> 02:16:58.777
continue -- And and we will

02:16:58.844 --> 02:17:00.813
continue to maintain the style.

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:02.981
We heard feedback I am gonna

02:17:03.048 --> 02:17:03.582
have to wrap it up because we

02:17:03.649 --> 02:17:05.150
want to make sure that we

02:17:05.217 --> 02:17:05.851
provide time for folks to be

02:17:05.918 --> 02:17:06.919
able to provide comment as well

02:17:06.985 --> 02:17:08.821
we've heard feedback.

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:09.521
About ongoing monitoring.

02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:11.290
In the importance of that -- In

02:17:11.356 --> 02:17:13.058
being able to have real time

02:17:13.125 --> 02:17:14.960
feedback if -- We have

02:17:15.027 --> 02:17:16.795
challenges.

02:17:16.862 --> 02:17:19.031
How important as it is that to

02:17:19.098 --> 02:17:21.100
the three view -- As well as far

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:23.135
as the on going munching a

02:17:23.202 --> 02:17:24.770
communication to fleet in being

02:17:24.837 --> 02:17:25.337
able to build that into any

02:17:25.404 --> 02:17:26.805
agreements.

02:17:26.872 --> 02:17:33.045
I'll start with -- Here seem to

02:17:33.112 --> 02:17:36.882
work our way down in -- I just

02:17:36.949 --> 02:17:37.549
think it's crucially important

02:17:37.616 --> 02:17:38.217
that over this process for the

02:17:38.283 --> 02:17:39.218
next -- As it was stated maybe

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:42.921
five years -- That.

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:44.990
The fleet really has a say in

02:17:45.057 --> 02:17:45.657
and how this is done and we

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:47.192
really hope that this is done

02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:48.961
right -- For magnitude research

02:17:49.027 --> 02:17:50.896
not just for fisheries but also

02:17:50.963 --> 02:17:54.867
for environmental impact as well
--

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:55.534
I don't wanna say we'll have one

02:17:55.601 --> 02:17:57.269
shot reading this right but it

02:17:57.336 --> 02:17:58.937
really seems that we really do

02:17:59.004 --> 02:17:59.571
only have one shot at getting

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:00.205
this right.

02:18:00.272 --> 02:18:02.941
And so I really hope that --

02:18:03.008 --> 02:18:04.977
There's further dialogue in a

02:18:05.043 --> 02:18:06.879
lot more discussion with Ford

02:18:06.945 --> 02:18:08.981
with -- As we go through this

02:18:09.047 --> 02:18:12.885
process thank you so much your

02:18:12.951 --> 02:18:15.087
of course three with their sins

02:18:15.154 --> 02:18:15.621
comments -- Monitor is

02:18:15.687 --> 02:18:16.922
critically important.

02:18:16.989 --> 02:18:21.126
We need to set bass lines now

02:18:21.193 --> 02:18:23.061
those include economic bayside's

02:18:23.128 --> 02:18:25.097
human use bass lines -- But we

02:18:25.164 --> 02:18:26.932
can't.

02:18:26.999 --> 02:18:28.934
Do monitoring.

02:18:29.001 --> 02:18:31.103
In the sense of learning from

02:18:31.170 --> 02:18:33.238
mistakes and and pulling back

02:18:33.305 --> 02:18:33.839
from the break so to speak.

02:18:33.906 --> 02:18:35.407
If it's an all or nothing

02:18:35.474 --> 02:18:36.942
proposition with respect to

02:18:37.009 --> 02:18:39.077
development -- I'd love to see

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:41.280
the state take a real interest

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:44.883
in internet approaches --

02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:45.517
Whether that be some sort of

02:18:45.584 --> 02:18:47.286
smaller scale operational

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:49.254
implementation -- Putting ten

02:18:49.321 --> 02:18:51.423
turbines in the water instead of

02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:53.392
a hundred to start monitoring

02:18:53.458 --> 02:18:55.027
the situation there.

02:18:55.093 --> 02:18:56.962
And then determining whether or

02:18:57.029 --> 02:18:57.663
not these projects are

02:18:57.729 --> 02:18:59.264
appropriate or if there are any

02:18:59.331 --> 02:19:02.935
anticipate unanticipated.

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:05.037
Impacts.

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:05.737
I have a project if you will

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:07.239
something like that right yeah.

02:19:07.306 --> 02:19:09.208
Absolutely thank you so much.

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:11.043
Echo everything they said --

02:19:11.109 --> 02:19:11.610
Your Monning is critically

02:19:11.677 --> 02:19:13.145
important but it's only

02:19:13.212 --> 02:19:14.980
wanderings only valuable if you

02:19:15.047 --> 02:19:15.647
have the correct building blocks

02:19:15.714 --> 02:19:17.115
on either side one is that it

02:19:17.182 --> 02:19:17.816
you know if you're monitoring

02:19:17.883 --> 02:19:19.284
and you see an impact -- You see

02:19:19.351 --> 02:19:19.918
an effect that maybe you didn't

02:19:19.985 --> 02:19:21.220
anticipate or maybe is worse

02:19:21.286 --> 02:19:22.988
than you thought what do you do

02:19:23.055 --> 02:19:23.655
about it so unless you have an

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:25.390
action plan for what comes out

02:19:25.457 --> 02:19:26.058
of the monitoring.

02:19:26.124 --> 02:19:27.125
The Monning in of itself isn't

02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:28.894
very helpful and you also need

02:19:28.961 --> 02:19:29.494
to be able to effectively

02:19:29.561 --> 02:19:30.996
monitor you need baseline

02:19:31.063 --> 02:19:31.330
information.

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:33.098
And that.

02:19:33.165 --> 02:19:33.765
In terms of fisheries takes a

02:19:33.832 --> 02:19:35.367
long time to get and you know

02:19:35.434 --> 02:19:37.269
one or two year time series of

02:19:37.336 --> 02:19:39.071
what's going on and in the

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:39.738
spatial.

02:19:39.805 --> 02:19:41.073
Areas is not going to tell you

02:19:41.139 --> 02:19:41.740
what you need to know thirty

02:19:41.807 --> 02:19:43.008
years now to see what changes

02:19:43.075 --> 02:19:43.609
are you need to get.

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:45.277
Started on those types of

02:19:45.344 --> 02:19:47.112
studies and designing those

02:19:47.179 --> 02:19:49.147
research needs as soon as soon

02:19:49.214 --> 02:19:49.715
as possible.

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:51.149
Has there been -- In my

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:51.850
ignorance and I apologize has

02:19:51.917 --> 02:19:54.987
there been compensation for loss

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:56.989
of vision or anywhere else

02:19:57.055 --> 02:19:59.258
fishing gear -- No anywhere else

02:19:59.324 --> 02:19:59.958
in the world or on the east

02:20:00.025 --> 02:20:01.460
coast has there been discussion

02:20:01.526 --> 02:20:07.132
about data compensation for the

02:20:07.199 --> 02:20:09.034
fleet.

02:20:09.101 --> 02:20:11.169
There have been payments made --

02:20:11.236 --> 02:20:11.870
In in Europe so in.

02:20:11.937 --> 02:20:13.505
In the U. K. fishing is allowed

02:20:13.572 --> 02:20:15.207
in wind energy or is in the rest

02:20:15.274 --> 02:20:15.874
of Europe it's not and so.

02:20:15.941 --> 02:20:17.209
The rest of Europe it was very

02:20:17.276 --> 02:20:19.211
easy to sort of nationally

02:20:19.278 --> 02:20:21.046
decide what to do with with.

02:20:21.113 --> 02:20:21.747
Fishing with fishermen who are

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:23.415
displaced right because you know

02:20:23.482 --> 02:20:25.183
they're moving -- In the UK

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:25.851
there were payments on the east

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:27.352
coast there's payments in

02:20:27.419 --> 02:20:30.989
discussion and I wouldn't know

02:20:31.056 --> 02:20:33.125
if any checks Ben cut but but

02:20:33.191 --> 02:20:33.825
yes -- Unfortunately a lot of

02:20:33.892 --> 02:20:34.459
those discussions happened early

02:20:34.526 --> 02:20:35.227
in the process -- Before any

02:20:35.294 --> 02:20:37.396
impacts are minimized and that

02:20:37.462 --> 02:20:39.264

Senate youth already is that

02:23:32.304 --> 02:23:33.738
local government joint powers

02:23:33.805 --> 02:23:35.540
agency here in humble county.

02:23:35.607 --> 02:23:37.242
And our mission is to develop

02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:37.943
sustainable energy initiatives

02:23:38.009 --> 02:23:39.377
on behalf of the county and all

02:23:39.444 --> 02:23:41.279
of our member cities.

02:23:41.346 --> 02:23:43.248
At and we are also responsible

02:23:43.315 --> 02:23:45.217
through committee J. segregation

02:23:45.283 --> 02:23:47.219
for the electricity supply part

02:23:47.285 --> 02:23:49.221
of electricity service here so

02:23:49.287 --> 02:23:49.888
we're we're responsible for

02:23:49.955 --> 02:23:57.395
procuring the power that that

02:23:57.462 --> 02:23:58.063
the power symbol county.

02:23:58.130 --> 02:23:59.297
And and so as part of that you

02:23:59.364 --> 02:23:59.931
know we're obviously interested

02:23:59.998 --> 02:24:00.632
in moving towards the state

02:24:00.699 --> 02:24:01.700
goals are local goals of a 100%

02:24:01.766 --> 02:24:03.268
renewable power.

02:24:03.335 --> 02:24:03.969
And I'm sure win is that is a

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:05.437
huge potential there and so did

02:24:05.504 --> 02:24:06.071
to your point you know I think

02:24:06.138 --> 02:24:07.372
we're also as a local public

02:24:07.439 --> 02:24:09.407
agency very committed. To not

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:11.309
wanting to have our power be at

02:24:11.376 --> 02:24:13.278
the expense of you know.

02:24:13.345 --> 02:24:13.979
Unacceptable impact

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:17.382
environmental or fishing and you

02:24:17.449 --> 02:24:19.317
know concerns and so I think you

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:21.319
know are proactive approach has

02:24:21.386 --> 02:24:23.288
been really to not be.

02:24:23.355 --> 02:24:25.223
Sort of passive and hope that

02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:27.225
this moves forward in a way that

02:24:27.292 --> 02:24:27.926
our community finds acceptable

02:24:27.993 --> 02:24:29.728
and that addresses environmental

02:24:29.794 --> 02:24:31.696
and fishing concerns and so.

02:24:31.763 --> 02:24:33.465
You know make my board is really
--

02:24:33.532 --> 02:24:35.567
I think been -- Bolden saying we

02:24:35.634 --> 02:24:36.268
want to get in front of this we

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:37.736
don't want to just you know hope

02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:39.337
we get a lucky developer that

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:39.971
really cares about these things

02:24:40.038 --> 02:24:41.273
as much as we do.

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:41.973
And so that's why we've been

02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:43.608
very active in trying to to get

02:24:43.675 --> 02:24:45.677
in front of it and and move this

02:24:45.744 --> 02:24:47.646
forward with really a community

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:49.347
driven process with

02:24:49.414 --> 02:24:51.249
environmental concerns in the

02:24:51.316 --> 02:24:51.883
fishing community and that the

02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:53.285
entire community.

With a true seat at the table in

02:24:54.052 --> 02:24:55.520
the decision making and not

02:24:55.587 --> 02:24:57.422
being in a responsive reactive

02:24:57.489 --> 02:24:59.391
mode and so we're we're looking

02:24:59.457 --> 02:25:00.091

work within the framework of the

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:05.230
bomb process and and obviously

02:25:05.297 --> 02:25:05.830

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:31.783
But also support that we need to

02:26:31.850 --> 02:26:33.585
use our natural gas which is

02:26:33.652 --> 02:26:35.587
fluent mental have lot of

02:26:35.654 --> 02:26:37.455
disagreement about that but that

02:26:37.522 --> 02:26:39.391
needs to be one of the other.

02:26:39.457 --> 02:26:45.363
Tools we have in our toolbox --

02:26:45.430 --> 02:26:49.601
You know the the all of these

02:26:49.668 --> 02:26:51.503
things out really good in the

02:26:51.569 --> 02:26:53.605
hall to legislate your and on

02:26:53.672 --> 02:26:54.306
paper.

02:26:54.372 --> 02:26:55.373
But when they come down to those

02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:57.409
of us that actually produce.

02:26:57.475 --> 02:26:59.444
It's a different scenario -- It

02:26:59.511 --> 02:27:03.581
really it really -- Sure let me

02:27:03.648 --> 02:27:05.617
let me cut to the chase I I I.

02:27:05.684 --> 02:27:06.217
riven California commercial

02:27:06.284 --> 02:27:07.385
beach fisherman.

02:27:07.452 --> 02:27:09.587
Okay these guys for fish but

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:11.523
they also are local crabbers

02:27:11.589 --> 02:27:13.525
there cooking line fishermen

02:27:13.591 --> 02:27:14.192
they're the guys to produce this

02:27:14.259 --> 02:27:15.460
great sustainable product that

02:27:15.527 --> 02:27:16.127
we need.

02:27:16.194 --> 02:27:17.662
We don't get the we don't get

02:27:17.729 --> 02:27:19.431
the support we need from our

02:27:19.497 --> 02:27:21.700
state and I know you reach out

02:27:21.766 --> 02:27:22.400
to us Mike we're having

02:27:22.467 --> 02:27:23.435
discussions right now about the

02:27:23.501 --> 02:27:25.637
crab closure the ridiculous clap

02:27:25.704 --> 02:27:26.337
crab closure.

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:29.908
So everyone of these things that

02:27:29.974 --> 02:27:31.509
happen.

02:27:31.576 --> 02:27:33.578
Look out.

02:27:33.645 --> 02:27:35.480
It's going to be good -- These

02:27:35.547 --> 02:27:36.181
guys will protect us we don't

02:27:36.247 --> 02:27:37.916
trust none of that because it's

02:27:37.982 --> 02:27:38.616
not that not be in our history.

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:39.884
The M. P. age that are out there

02:27:39.951 --> 02:27:41.820
have cut out a huge portion of

02:27:41.886 --> 02:27:43.521
our fishing.

02:27:43.588 --> 02:27:45.457
Unnecessarily this whole region

02:27:45.523 --> 02:27:47.592
is an MPA practically put the

02:27:47.659 --> 02:27:49.494
slayings on land.

02:27:49.561 --> 02:27:51.463
Or put him in the M. P. A.'s

02:27:51.529 --> 02:27:53.565
what you're just research areas

02:27:53.631 --> 02:27:54.265
anyway they're not they're

02:27:54.332 --> 02:27:55.700
they're not they're designed to

02:27:55.767 --> 02:27:57.902
produce fishing for us -- What

02:27:57.969 --> 02:27:59.971
other things it will communicate

02:28:00.038 --> 02:28:01.840
in writing with you -- I know

02:28:01.906 --> 02:28:03.508
this.

02:28:03.575 --> 02:28:05.510
Is gonna happen.

02:28:05.577 --> 02:28:06.211
Okay who who are not stupid

02:28:06.277 --> 02:28:09.481
we're just trying to figure out

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:11.516
which I we want you to Galgiani.

02:28:11.583 --> 02:28:13.852
Thank you thank you so much to

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:15.653

you for being here and thank you

02:28:16.354 --> 02:28:16.921
for leading off -- On that

02:28:16.988 --> 02:28:19.557
recognition as well and the

02:28:19.624 --> 02:28:20.125
tragedy in making the bill's

02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:21.526
going.

02:28:21.593 --> 02:28:23.628
No it is it is thank you so
much.

02:28:23.695 --> 02:28:25.530
Sir we welcome you thank you --

02:28:25.597 --> 02:28:26.197
My name is Tyler studs I'm with

02:28:26.264 --> 02:28:27.966
ET P. renewables -- I lied --

02:28:28.032 --> 02:28:29.801
The project manager for the red

02:28:29.868 --> 02:28:31.569
because doctor when project -- I

02:28:31.636 --> 02:28:33.805
bring to that -- About ten years

02:28:33.872 --> 02:28:35.573
experience in after when

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:37.475
industry including eight with

02:28:37.542 --> 02:28:38.176
the state of Massachusetts --

02:28:38.243 --> 02:28:39.577
Leading the state's investments

02:28:39.644 --> 02:28:41.479
in multi year multi million

02:28:41.546 --> 02:28:45.483
dollar baseline wildlife surveys
--

02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:46.184
The three points I want to make

02:28:46.251 --> 02:28:47.585
our number one to speak directly

02:28:47.652 --> 02:28:48.286
to the question posed in this

02:28:48.353 --> 02:28:51.790
panel -- I do believe that after

02:28:51.856 --> 02:28:52.457
wind wildlife and fisheries are

02:28:52.524 --> 02:28:55.493
compatible your work committed

02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:57.662
to making that actually be -- D.

02:28:57.729 --> 02:28:59.831
a yes -- I do believe that there

02:28:59.898 --> 02:29:01.499
are very good lessons learned

02:29:01.566 --> 02:29:03.568
but that each project is unique

02:29:03.635 --> 02:29:04.235
and those lessons learned are

02:29:04.302 --> 02:29:05.770
more in the process of how we

02:29:05.837 --> 02:29:07.772
create that then in the science

02:29:07.839 --> 02:29:11.743
findings themselves -- The third

02:29:11.810 --> 02:29:12.477
point is that we are I believe

02:29:12.544 --> 02:29:13.912
that we are on the right track
--

02:29:13.978 --> 02:29:16.014
So in terms of lessons learned

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:19.818
in process sees -- I echo what's

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:20.518
been shared by many of the

02:29:20.585 --> 02:29:21.986
panelists already and credit you

02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:23.788
for putting together phenomenal

02:29:23.855 --> 02:29:25.623
panel now -- Multiple panels.

02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:27.592
In the process it's key

02:29:27.659 --> 02:29:29.694
obviously to be engaged early

02:29:29.761 --> 02:29:31.796
and often with your all of the

02:29:31.863 --> 02:29:32.497
key stakeholders.

02:29:32.564 --> 02:29:35.600
Jointly scoping and identifying

02:29:35.667 --> 02:29:37.602
key research questions is

02:29:37.669 --> 02:29:39.737
critically important both on the

02:29:39.804 --> 02:29:40.405
fisheries level and on with --

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:43.641
With wide life -- Advocates in

02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:47.779
it and non profits -- We are as

02:29:47.846 --> 02:29:49.948
an industry engaging early right

02:29:50.014 --> 02:29:55.587
now with -- Key environmental --

02:29:55.653 --> 02:29:57.655
Agent actually in vinyl not non

02:29:57.722 --> 02:29:59.791
profits to identify how we can

02:29:59.858 --> 02:30:01.926
together jointly scope those

02:30:01.993 --> 02:30:03.595
pricing join these couples

02:30:03.661 --> 02:30:04.262
questions and implement those.

02:30:04.329 --> 02:30:07.599
So I will lastly just advocate

02:30:07.665 --> 02:30:08.266
you know that this it's

02:30:08.333 --> 02:30:09.767
critically important the state

02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:11.870
make investments -- Improvement

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:13.872
conducting you know early

02:30:13.938 --> 02:30:15.807
baseline wireless surveys be

02:30:15.874 --> 02:30:16.507
able to deal with existing data

02:30:16.574 --> 02:30:18.042
already to analyze those in the

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:25.650
context of archer wind -- And

02:30:25.717 --> 02:30:26.317
that yeah.

02:30:26.384 --> 02:30:27.919
We do that you know in a very

02:30:27.986 --> 02:30:29.621
high priority way.

the the state balm a task force.

02:31:05.723 --> 02:31:13.798
And so the early engagement.

02:31:13.865 --> 02:31:16.100
It was conducted with tribes and

02:31:16.167 --> 02:31:17.802
I just want to say like

02:31:17.869 --> 02:31:18.503
everybody else I said today

02:31:18.569 --> 02:31:19.904
early and qualitative engagement

02:31:19.971 --> 02:31:20.605
is critical.

02:31:20.672 --> 02:31:21.839
And everything is connected and

02:31:21.906 --> 02:31:23.975
everything needs balance.

02:31:24.042 --> 02:31:25.777
And that true that rancheria we

Trinidad.

02:31:33.885 --> 02:31:34.519
And we also own a crab boat so

02:31:34.586 --> 02:31:36.054
we're directly impacted with --

02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:37.989
Many aspects of the discussions

02:31:38.056 --> 02:31:38.690
that are happening today so

02:31:38.756 --> 02:31:40.024

knowledge and that that isn't a

02:31:50.168 --> 02:31:52.103
forgotten or not included when

02:31:52.170 --> 02:31:54.072

02:32:35.847 --> 02:32:37.749
Trinidad coastal land trust.

02:32:37.815 --> 02:32:38.449
In the spirit of saving what was

02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:39.117
left of our great read words we

02:32:39.183 --> 02:32:40.151
have to be careful not to give

02:32:40.218 --> 02:32:43.755
away what we can't get back.

02:32:43.821 --> 02:32:45.790
I'd like to speak for those who

02:32:45.857 --> 02:32:47.892
have no voice and a no on or not

02:32:47.959 --> 02:32:49.761
at this meeting right now.

02:32:49.827 --> 02:32:50.461
The other trust the mirror lets

Pelicans and so many others some

02:32:54.499 --> 02:32:56.067
of which circumnavigate the

02:32:56.134 --> 02:32:57.802
globe with their ancient and

02:32:57.869 --> 02:32:59.771
historic flights.

02:32:59.837 --> 02:33:02.040
Wind farms are currently doesn't

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:05.810
meeting birds and bats --

02:33:05.877 --> 02:33:07.745
Mitigation and avoidance.

Are not currently successful on

02:33:10.181 --> 02:33:11.849
land.

02:33:11.916 --> 02:33:12.483
Why should we think it will be

02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:13.851
off shore?

02:33:13.918 --> 02:33:16.254
A local sub species of bat will

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:20.091
become extinct within the next

02:33:20.158 --> 02:33:22.160
ten years to land based wind

02:33:22.226 --> 02:33:22.760
energy.

02:33:22.827 --> 02:33:24.362
It is a current on it is a

02:33:24.429 --> 02:33:25.930
current ongoing problem which

02:33:25.997 --> 02:33:27.865
has not been solved.

02:33:27.932 --> 02:33:30.268
The birds may be out of sight do

02:33:30.334 --> 02:33:32.303
not but do not let them be out

02:33:32.370 --> 02:33:33.871
of mind.

02:33:33.938 --> 02:33:34.439
They depend on us to protect

02:33:34.505 --> 02:33:37.942
them.

02:33:38.009 --> 02:33:38.609
That's it thank you city thank

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:39.277
you so much and thank you for

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:40.311
being here today were grateful

02:33:40.378 --> 02:33:41.946
for your comments and your

02:33:42.013 --> 02:33:42.547
testimony.

02:33:42.613 --> 02:33:45.917
Taking notes on well good

02:33:45.983 --> 02:33:46.551
afternoon it's good to see you

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:48.119
Sir welcome if two minutes.

02:33:48.186 --> 02:33:49.854
Thank you Mister chairman.

02:33:49.921 --> 02:33:51.823
For providing this opportunity

02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:54.158
today -- My name is Dave built

02:33:54.225 --> 02:33:55.827
some a local crap and salmon

02:33:55.893 --> 02:33:56.494
fisherman.

02:33:56.561 --> 02:33:59.997
Actually fish salmon -- As far

02:34:00.064 --> 02:34:04.001
south as fibers -- I want to

02:34:04.068 --> 02:34:04.669
thank -- Of want to talk about

02:34:04.736 --> 02:34:08.005
the the business of involving

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:10.007
the fishing community early in

02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:11.876
the discussions.

02:34:11.943 --> 02:34:13.945
And I want to thank our C. eight

02:34:14.011 --> 02:34:15.980
E.. Eight for doing that to the

02:34:16.047 --> 02:34:16.647
extent that we've actually

02:34:16.714 --> 02:34:18.182
signed and M. O. U. with them.

02:34:18.249 --> 02:34:20.051
One thick principal power like

02:34:20.118 --> 02:34:21.986
was for reaching out to

02:34:22.053 --> 02:34:23.888
fishermen.

02:34:23.955 --> 02:34:25.923
There a couple of things that

02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:26.557
need to be included in not out

02:34:26.624 --> 02:34:31.896
reach -- The first is -- The

02:34:31.963 --> 02:34:34.132
issues of of transit of the

02:34:34.198 --> 02:34:38.136
harbor -- Of the footprint of

02:34:38.202 --> 02:34:40.071
the cable it's going to come

02:34:40.138 --> 02:34:40.772
ashore.

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:41.973
What are the consequences of of

02:34:42.039 --> 02:34:44.075
that cable going to be?

02:34:44.142 --> 02:34:46.144
Order fishing grounds which it

02:34:46.210 --> 02:34:49.981
most of go through -- Are we

02:34:50.047 --> 02:34:52.116
going to be able to continue to

02:34:52.183 --> 02:34:53.885
come and go.

02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:56.053
From Humboldt Bay to fishing

02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:57.855
grounds at the time of our

02:34:57.922 --> 02:34:59.991
choosing rather than at someone

02:35:00.057 --> 02:35:02.160
else's pleasure that needs to be

02:35:02.226 --> 02:35:05.863
discussed soon.

02:35:05.930 --> 02:35:06.531
And the other thing is -- I

02:35:06.597 --> 02:35:08.166
heard today for the first time

02:35:08.232 --> 02:35:08.866
that there's an anticipated

02:35:08.933 --> 02:35:12.103
expansion if this works. Two of

02:35:12.170 --> 02:35:14.105
a production on the order of

02:35:14.172 --> 02:35:16.040
twenty gigabytes -- That could

02:35:16.107 --> 02:35:16.707
be great for the state of

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:18.176
California could be good from

02:35:18.242 --> 02:35:19.977
all day.

02:35:20.044 --> 02:35:22.013
Where is the footprint for that

02:35:22.079 --> 02:35:23.981
expansion going to be?

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:26.284
All presumably the of humble

02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:28.286
call area and the Morrell big

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:30.288
call area or the best available

02:35:30.354 --> 02:35:31.989
sites.

02:35:32.056 --> 02:35:34.091
And we're looking at maybe two

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:36.160
hundred megawatts from those

02:35:36.227 --> 02:35:38.129
sites we're looking at we we

02:35:38.196 --> 02:35:39.964
just heard about a proposed

02:35:40.031 --> 02:35:41.999
hundredfold expansion.

02:35:42.066 --> 02:35:46.237
Of offshore wind production.

02:35:46.304 --> 02:35:49.974
Our I would like to see.

02:35:50.041 --> 02:35:52.310
The energy industries maps as

02:35:52.376 --> 02:35:55.947
much as they want to see the

02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:58.015
fishing industries maps -- We

02:35:58.082 --> 02:35:59.951
have to do that before we get

02:36:00.017 --> 02:36:02.119
much farther with this expansion

02:36:02.186 --> 02:36:03.988
to twenty gigs.

02:36:04.055 --> 02:36:04.655
Thank you thanks much for C.

02:36:16.033 --> 02:36:16.567
Rodriguez and I am here today

02:36:16.634 --> 02:36:18.202
representing the business

02:36:18.269 --> 02:36:22.006
network. For offshore wind.

02:36:22.073 --> 02:36:22.607
The network as we like to be

02:36:22.673 --> 02:36:24.242
called we're a nonprofit

02:36:24.308 --> 02:36:26.277
organization solely focused on

02:36:26.344 --> 02:36:28.412
the development of the U. S.

02:36:28.479 --> 02:36:30.248
offshore wind industry.

02:36:30.314 --> 02:36:32.283
And the advancement of its

02:36:32.350 --> 02:36:33.985
supply chain.

02:36:34.051 --> 02:36:36.354
We are -- Consider ourself and

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:38.089
if Thor's Tatum voice for the

offshore winds business

02:36:40.024 --> 02:36:40.658
community we bring together.

02:36:40.725 --> 02:36:42.360
Developers policy makers global

02:36:42.426 --> 02:36:44.362
experts and we have more than

02:36:44.428 --> 02:36:45.963
three hundred member businesses

02:36:46.030 --> 02:36:49.967
including numerous labor unions

02:36:50.034 --> 02:36:50.534
for critical discussions and

02:36:50.601 --> 02:36:52.003
unprecedented.

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:54.138
Networking opportunities we just

02:36:54.205 --> 02:36:56.207
held our sixth international

02:36:56.274 --> 02:36:59.977
partnering forum and many of

02:37:00.044 --> 02:37:02.013
these speakers here today.

02:37:02.079 --> 02:37:04.081
Participated with us and a 100%

02:37:04.148 --> 02:37:06.017
of our resources are focused on

02:37:06.083 --> 02:37:08.152
the offshore wind -- Supply

02:37:08.219 --> 02:37:10.388
chain development we try to be

02:37:10.454 --> 02:37:12.323
an advocate for our members were

02:37:12.390 --> 02:37:14.325
dedicated to building business

02:37:14.392 --> 02:37:16.394
across sectors into a coherent

02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:18.095
supply chain.

02:37:18.162 --> 02:37:20.231
That supports domestic wind

02:37:20.298 --> 02:37:22.199
farms and really establishes the

02:37:22.266 --> 02:37:22.900
United States as a global

02:37:22.967 --> 02:37:24.435
competitor in the offshore wind

02:37:24.502 --> 02:37:28.139
market -- We were started in --

02:37:28.205 --> 02:37:30.441
Twenty twelve in Maryland and we

02:37:30.508 --> 02:37:34.378
have grown -- To a significant

02:37:34.445 --> 02:37:38.149
number of as I said across the

02:37:38.215 --> 02:37:40.184
the state -- Obviously our work

02:37:40.251 --> 02:37:42.086
here our work here began in

02:37:42.153 --> 02:37:42.687
twenty sixteen and I want to

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:46.090
thank -- Tom as well -- In

02:37:46.157 --> 02:37:48.125
twenty eighteen we held our

02:37:48.192 --> 02:37:48.659
floating frontiers.

02:37:48.726 --> 02:37:50.328
Meeting and produce an

02:37:50.394 --> 02:37:54.065
environmental -- Impacts paper

02:37:54.131 --> 02:37:56.067
from that and that is on your

02:37:56.133 --> 02:37:56.734
website we appreciate that we

02:37:56.801 --> 02:37:58.369
look forward to continuing to

02:37:58.436 --> 02:38:00.404
work with you one example that I

02:38:00.471 --> 02:38:04.075
would just site is that we have

02:38:04.141 --> 02:38:04.742
worked a lot with -- Jeff the

02:38:04.809 --> 02:38:06.310
British government and we have

02:38:06.377 --> 02:38:12.383
obtained -- Information about

02:38:12.450 --> 02:38:14.452
their debt Brent work with the

02:38:14.518 --> 02:38:15.052
broadly with the fishing

02:38:15.119 --> 02:38:16.487
industry and they are very

02:38:16.554 --> 02:38:17.121
interested in.

02:38:17.188 --> 02:38:18.155
Working further with you on

02:38:18.222 --> 02:38:18.723
discussion so I would look

02:38:18.789 --> 02:38:20.424
forward -- To helping us

02:38:20.491 --> 02:38:22.593
facilitate that as well and we

02:38:22.660 --> 02:38:24.228
just look forward to being a

02:38:24.295 --> 02:38:26.130
strong partner in.

02:38:26.197 --> 02:38:28.232
The numerous dialogues and also

02:38:28.299 --> 02:38:30.134
in the regulatory and

02:38:30.201 --> 02:38:30.801
legislative process thank you so

02:38:30.868 --> 02:38:32.103
much.

02:38:32.169 --> 02:38:34.205
Thank you for travelling humbled

02:38:34.271 --> 02:38:34.805
as well we're grateful you're

02:38:34.872 --> 02:38:38.109
here.

02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:38.709
All right we're gonna lock me

02:38:38.776 --> 02:38:39.343
ma'am.

02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:40.311
Good afternoon thank you for

02:38:40.378 --> 02:38:41.012
hanging with this is good to see

02:38:41.078 --> 02:38:42.513
you you have two minutes to four

02:38:42.580 --> 02:38:43.147
stores good afternoon thank you

02:38:43.214 --> 02:38:44.548
so much for putting together

02:38:44.615 --> 02:38:46.384
this excellent yeah -- Hearing

02:38:46.450 --> 02:38:48.686
and I want to say I've been to

02:38:48.753 --> 02:38:50.688
many -- Meetings on this topic

02:38:50.755 --> 02:38:52.390
and this is by far the most

02:38:52.456 --> 02:38:54.125
informative I've been.

02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:54.825
To mostly because of the

02:38:54.892 --> 02:38:58.262
diversity of voices an interest

02:38:58.329 --> 02:39:00.097
that have been represented here
--

02:39:00.164 --> 02:39:00.798
I think it's really important to

02:39:00.865 --> 02:39:02.466
have these types of meetings so

02:39:02.533 --> 02:39:04.168
that we can all hear the the

02:39:04.235 --> 02:39:04.869
concerns of different interest

02:39:04.935 --> 02:39:08.539
groups -- Humble bee keeper -- I

02:39:08.606 --> 02:39:10.474
forgot to say my name is

02:39:10.541 --> 02:39:11.108
Jennifer calls I'm the director

02:39:11.175 --> 02:39:12.410
of mobile bay keeper.

02:39:12.476 --> 02:39:14.378
Thinking and we're very hopeful

02:39:14.445 --> 02:39:16.280
that wind energy can help

02:39:16.347 --> 02:39:18.182
California meet our renewable

02:39:18.249 --> 02:39:20.384
energy targets -- In large part

02:39:20.451 --> 02:39:22.253
because we really need to slow

02:39:22.319 --> 02:39:22.887
down the effects of climate

02:39:22.953 --> 02:39:24.488
change which are -- You know

02:39:24.555 --> 02:39:26.724
having a a cumulative of a fact

02:39:26.791 --> 02:39:28.726
on not only marine resources but

02:39:28.793 --> 02:39:30.594
the fishing industry so ocean

02:39:30.661 --> 02:39:32.430
acidification toxic algae.

02:39:32.496 --> 02:39:36.200
Sea level rise are all serious

02:39:36.267 --> 02:39:38.269
problems here in Humboldt Bay --

02:39:38.335 --> 02:39:40.438
I've been really relieved to

02:39:40.504 --> 02:39:42.306
hear so much discussion about

02:39:42.373 --> 02:39:44.208
the need for a baseline

02:39:44.275 --> 02:39:44.875
information to do appropriate

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:48.279
citing for this -- Project --

02:39:48.345 --> 02:39:50.548
And then also we really need to

02:39:50.614 --> 02:39:54.218
have an appropriate scale.

02:39:54.285 --> 02:39:56.387
And having stakeholder

02:39:56.454 --> 02:39:58.189
engagement that's a meaningful

02:39:58.255 --> 02:40:00.191
early on as been talked about

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:02.193
many many times by many people

02:40:02.259 --> 02:40:02.827
that is really critical.

02:40:02.893 --> 02:40:06.363
And looking out the the wide

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:08.299
range of companies that

02:40:08.365 --> 02:40:10.367
responded to the call -- I am

02:40:10.434 --> 02:40:12.636
really hopeful that our redwood

02:40:12.703 --> 02:40:14.371
coast energy authority will have

02:40:14.438 --> 02:40:18.409
priority -- Because they are a

02:40:18.476 --> 02:40:20.478
board of elected officials that

02:40:20.544 --> 02:40:24.215
represent the local interest and

02:40:24.281 --> 02:40:24.915
so we really need input from.

02:40:24.982 --> 02:40:28.385
Local experts as well as far you

02:40:28.452 --> 02:40:30.254
know experts from elsewhere --

02:40:30.321 --> 02:40:32.289
We really need local

02:40:32.356 --> 02:40:34.391
stakeholders we need the tribal

02:40:34.458 --> 02:40:36.360
representatives -- We need

02:40:36.427 --> 02:40:38.262
everybody to be participating in

02:40:38.329 --> 02:40:40.531
the US and certainly we need a

02:40:40.598 --> 02:40:42.366
lot more information about the

02:40:42.433 --> 02:40:44.468
resources offshore -- Before we

02:40:44.535 --> 02:40:46.670
launch into this so it as an

02:40:46.737 --> 02:40:48.506
environmental advocate I just

02:40:48.572 --> 02:40:50.274
want to really emphasize the

02:40:50.341 --> 02:40:52.309
point that we're hopeful that

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:54.345
the environmental impact

02:40:54.411 --> 02:40:55.045
analysis.

02:40:55.112 --> 02:40:56.480
Citing mitigation monitoring can

02:40:56.547 --> 02:40:58.249
all be done.

02:40:58.315 --> 02:41:00.417
As well as possible so that we

02:41:00.484 --> 02:41:02.453
can actually have a successful.

02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:04.588
Renewable energy project here

02:41:04.655 --> 02:41:06.524
thank you and Richard thank you

02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:08.192
so much thanks for coming today

02:41:08.259 --> 02:41:08.893
for all your work.

02:41:08.959 --> 02:41:12.396
Discounts when yes I got a work

02:41:12.463 --> 02:41:14.698
on councilman member it -- City

02:41:14.765 --> 02:41:16.634
for dell but I'm also have been

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:17.268
very involved in the redwood

02:41:17.334 --> 02:41:17.768
region economic development

02:41:17.835 --> 02:41:18.402
commission.

02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:19.103
And I think this has some.

02:41:19.169 --> 02:41:20.604
Great potential for our area for

02:41:20.671 --> 02:41:22.573
economic development -- At the

02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:24.708
same time however -- I think we

02:41:24.775 --> 02:41:26.610
really need to go out and and

02:41:26.677 --> 02:41:28.779
look at best practices or people

02:41:28.846 --> 02:41:30.548
that have gone before us in

02:41:30.614 --> 02:41:32.349
other parts of the world.

02:41:32.416 --> 02:41:33.017
I'm sure there are other

02:41:33.083 --> 02:41:34.585
countries other companies that

02:41:34.652 --> 02:41:36.620
are -- Leaders in this area that

02:41:36.687 --> 02:41:38.589
are known for their best

02:41:38.656 --> 02:41:40.391
practices hopefully or and or

02:41:40.457 --> 02:41:41.091
have learned from their
mistakes.

02:41:41.158 --> 02:41:42.626
So I'm hoping that will really

02:41:42.693 --> 02:41:44.495
do that research to be able to

02:41:44.562 --> 02:41:46.430
bring the best practices before

02:41:46.497 --> 02:41:48.632
we before we step in the wrong

02:41:48.699 --> 02:41:50.334
direction or do leases.

02:41:50.401 --> 02:41:52.303
We also need to make sure and

02:41:52.369 --> 02:41:53.003
I'm sure through the process it

02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:58.742
sounds like again we bought some

02:41:58.809 --> 02:42:00.311
great state colors together

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:00.945
thank you.

02:42:01.011 --> 02:42:01.645
So much for doing that stern

02:42:01.712 --> 02:42:02.313
McGuire -- And everyone that has

02:42:02.379 --> 02:42:02.980
been involved here I think

02:42:03.047 --> 02:42:03.647
that's great -- I do hope that

02:42:03.714 --> 02:42:06.317
will mitigate for any a water

02:42:06.383 --> 02:42:08.419
fell fax -- Four I hope we will

02:42:08.485 --> 02:42:10.688
also -- Do cover the sustainable

02:42:10.754 --> 02:42:14.358
concerns of the fishing
industry.

02:42:14.425 --> 02:42:16.393
And and their ability to

02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:18.462
navigate their ability -- To

02:42:18.529 --> 02:42:20.664
continue to create their own

02:42:20.731 --> 02:42:22.333
livelihood it's a great industry

02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:24.335
and I I hope that can continue.

02:42:24.401 --> 02:42:25.002
To other thought several quick

02:42:25.069 --> 02:42:28.405
ones -- One is -- That we well

02:42:28.472 --> 02:42:30.341
one other basically.

02:42:30.407 --> 02:42:31.008
If we do go forward I'm hoping

02:42:31.075 --> 02:42:34.345
that we take a look at this.

02:42:34.411 --> 02:42:35.045
I remember the old internet

02:42:35.112 --> 02:42:36.480
thing where you started out with

02:42:36.547 --> 02:42:37.147
a category three or then you

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:38.782
went to five and then you went

02:42:38.849 --> 02:42:40.718
I'm hoping that if we are we do

02:42:40.784 --> 02:42:42.453
have the potential to do a

02:42:42.519 --> 02:42:44.588
project program like ten when

02:42:44.655 --> 02:42:46.357
mills or whatever.

02:42:46.423 --> 02:42:47.024
And then we're thinking of

02:42:47.091 --> 02:42:48.692
expanding this along the coast

02:42:48.759 --> 02:42:50.361
or whatever areas.

02:42:50.427 --> 02:42:52.396
That we build the capacity up

02:42:52.463 --> 02:42:53.063
front if we're gonna make a

02:42:53.130 --> 02:42:54.598
major investment in regards to

02:42:54.665 --> 02:42:56.467
getting this on shore -- I I

02:42:56.533 --> 02:42:58.535
hope we don't skinny on it but I

02:42:58.602 --> 02:43:00.337
hope we have the line capacity

02:43:00.404 --> 02:43:02.473
to really -- To really expand

02:43:02.539 --> 02:43:03.140
out.

02:43:03.207 --> 02:43:04.541
So that we don't have to make

02:43:04.608 --> 02:43:05.175
the investment twice -- Because

02:43:05.242 --> 02:43:06.877
we need to look at it forty

02:43:06.944 --> 02:43:08.779
fifty years out and and what we

02:43:08.846 --> 02:43:10.648
can really do with it if it is

02:43:10.714 --> 02:43:12.483
successful so thank thank you

02:43:12.549 --> 02:43:13.183
for being here.

02:43:13.250 --> 02:43:16.520
Thank you so much has been great

02:43:16.587 --> 02:43:17.087
for for your testimony today

02:43:17.154 --> 02:43:17.788
thank you very.

02:43:17.855 --> 02:43:18.422
And hang with us good afternoon

02:43:18.489 --> 02:43:19.089
you've been here since this

02:43:19.156 --> 02:43:20.724
morning thank you so much it's

02:43:20.791 --> 02:43:22.860
good to see the floor is yours

02:43:22.926 --> 02:43:23.560
your two minutes.

02:43:23.627 --> 02:43:24.895
Answer -- My name is Brad Wilson

02:43:24.962 --> 02:43:30.501
and you read as a graduate of

02:43:30.567 --> 02:43:32.503
the renewable or the

02:43:32.569 --> 02:43:33.203
environmental resources

02:43:33.270 --> 02:43:34.672
engineering program H. issue --

02:43:34.738 --> 02:43:36.607
I see the potential of wind

02:43:36.674 --> 02:43:38.609
energy as a real asset -- I I'm

02:43:38.676 --> 02:43:40.678
an advocate -- This was a

02:43:40.744 --> 02:43:42.546
brilliant meeting today -- It's

02:43:42.613 --> 02:43:44.648
all grew up front stakeholder

02:43:44.715 --> 02:43:46.684
coordination across a wide

02:43:46.750 --> 02:43:48.686
spectrum that these sorts of

02:43:48.752 --> 02:43:49.353
things are going to be

02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:50.721
successful -- Those things be

02:43:50.788 --> 02:43:52.823
noted -- A wind farm off shore

02:43:52.890 --> 02:43:56.560
of any size -- Really as as

02:43:56.627 --> 02:43:58.662
locally reported as confirmed by

02:43:58.729 --> 02:44:00.564
Larry -- To Kerr -- Harbor

02:44:00.631 --> 02:44:06.437
district yeah commissioner --

02:44:06.503 --> 02:44:07.104
Significant upgrades are

02:44:07.171 --> 02:44:08.539
required to report -- The four

02:44:08.605 --> 02:44:09.239
were really able to do anything

02:44:09.306 --> 02:44:10.774
off shore so hundred ten working

02:44:10.841 --> 02:44:11.442
surfaces new.

02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:13.043
Ports -- Potentially expanded

02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:14.812
infrastructure in transmission

02:44:14.878 --> 02:44:16.580
and distribution.

02:44:16.647 --> 02:44:18.649
All those things -- The policy

02:44:18.716 --> 02:44:20.918
table -- Brought it up as a

02:44:20.984 --> 02:44:22.753
potential issue -- The industry

02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:26.623
table -- Brought it up again --

02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:26.990
That.

02:44:27.057 --> 02:44:28.459
Often times.

02:44:28.525 --> 02:44:30.527
The legislature or the local

02:44:30.594 --> 02:44:31.195
government is called upon to

02:44:31.261 --> 02:44:32.896
kind of overcome some of those

02:44:32.963 --> 02:44:34.465
initial baseline.

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:36.500
Things to pave the way for

02:44:36.567 --> 02:44:37.101
industry to pave the way for a

02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:38.535
developer to come in.

02:44:38.602 --> 02:44:40.671
I was originally crafting this

02:44:40.738 --> 02:44:41.205
is a question to you but

02:44:41.271 --> 02:44:42.573
realizing you don't.

02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:43.273
Actually have the ability to

02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:44.875
respond I would suppose it's an

02:44:44.942 --> 02:44:46.677
encouragement. For the the

02:44:46.744 --> 02:44:48.512
California legislature to

02:44:48.579 --> 02:44:50.481
consider.

02:44:50.547 --> 02:44:52.549
The predecessor tasks that

02:44:52.616 --> 02:44:54.518
require significant funding --

02:44:54.585 --> 02:44:55.219
You know hundreds of millions of

02:44:55.285 --> 02:44:56.720
dollars to upgrade the

02:44:56.787 --> 02:44:58.756
infrastructure to even attempt.

02:44:58.822 --> 02:45:00.624
An offshore wind farm given the

02:45:00.691 --> 02:45:02.659
wind farm is you know. Ten

02:45:02.726 --> 02:45:04.862
fifteen years out of all these

02:45:04.928 --> 02:45:06.797
process or tasks -- The ability

02:45:06.864 --> 02:45:08.766
to upgrade the port all of those

02:45:08.832 --> 02:45:10.601
things need to happen before and

02:45:10.667 --> 02:45:12.603
as a way to attract -- Industry

02:45:12.669 --> 02:45:16.607
to our area -- As example by

02:45:16.673 --> 02:45:17.274
cases in Europe -- So assuming

02:45:17.341 --> 02:45:18.909
you don't have the ability to

02:45:18.976 --> 02:45:20.611
respond California legislature

02:45:20.677 --> 02:45:22.579
is working on anything like
that.

02:45:22.646 --> 02:45:23.247
I would encourage us to consider

02:45:23.313 --> 02:45:26.583
those things moving forward.

02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:27.251
No thank you miss Wilson and

02:45:27.317 --> 02:45:27.951
I'll just take a brief moment

02:45:28.018 --> 02:45:28.986
and I know that we have several

02:45:29.052 --> 02:45:29.686
speakers -- Keep it less than

02:45:29.753 --> 02:45:30.888
sixty seconds I think it's it's

02:45:30.954 --> 02:45:33.090
key that we look at what those

02:45:33.157 --> 02:45:34.792
potential up front costs will be

02:45:34.858 --> 02:45:36.593
for the infrastructure.

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:42.566
In what it would take to be able
--

02:45:42.633 --> 02:45:44.601
To develop that.

02:45:44.668 --> 02:45:45.235
In our neck of the woods I think

02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:46.737
that you're gonna have to

02:45:46.804 --> 02:45:47.371
significant driving costs. One

02:45:47.438 --> 02:45:48.605
on the ground for the port.

02:45:48.672 --> 02:45:49.273
The second I when it comes a

02:45:49.339 --> 02:45:52.643
transmission line -- The state

02:45:52.709 --> 02:45:54.578
has assisted.

02:45:54.645 --> 02:45:56.613
Specific renewable energy on

02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:58.549
transmission in the past --

02:45:58.615 --> 02:46:00.617
Through -- Greenhouse gas

02:46:00.684 --> 02:46:02.586
emission reduction funds.

02:46:02.653 --> 02:46:04.555
And that is not even begin been

02:46:04.621 --> 02:46:06.690
considered on this issue on this

02:46:06.757 --> 02:46:07.357
project let alone across the

02:46:07.424 --> 02:46:08.992
state for offshore wind but I

02:46:09.059 --> 02:46:10.694
promise you it's something that
--

02:46:10.761 --> 02:46:12.696
We will take a look at I would

02:46:12.763 --> 02:46:14.631
love to keep in touch and if

02:46:14.698 --> 02:46:15.299
it's okay.

02:46:15.365 --> 02:46:17.000
Thank you thank you so much as

02:46:17.067 --> 02:46:18.602
was appreciate that.

02:46:18.669 --> 02:46:19.236
Welcome Sir good afternoon.

02:46:19.303 --> 02:46:20.938
Thanks for hanging with us.

02:46:21.004 --> 02:46:21.638
Thank you Sir McGuire into the

02:46:21.705 --> 02:46:23.040
joint committee for sponsoring a

02:46:23.106 --> 02:46:24.942
terrific meeting I think it's

02:46:25.008 --> 02:46:25.542
just because of that it's been

02:46:25.609 --> 02:46:26.777
quite valuable thank you.

02:46:26.844 --> 02:46:28.612
My name is Scott Frazier my

02:46:28.679 --> 02:46:30.714
consulting wildlife biologist

02:46:30.781 --> 02:46:31.348
from the lake California.

02:46:31.415 --> 02:46:32.950
Early on in the on land when

02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:34.918
development hats be I was able

02:46:34.985 --> 02:46:36.720
to work on some of those

02:46:36.787 --> 02:46:37.354
projects where there was a high

02:46:37.421 --> 02:46:38.822
degree of trial and error

02:46:38.889 --> 02:46:40.591
learning.

02:46:40.657 --> 02:46:41.291
And that is certainly not what

02:46:41.358 --> 02:46:42.793
we want to see here off shore in

02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:43.260
a very difficult work

02:46:43.327 --> 02:46:46.597
environment.

02:46:46.663 --> 02:46:48.665
So I think that -- It's

02:46:48.732 --> 02:46:50.567
important that the baseline

02:46:50.634 --> 02:46:52.569
studies occur and the research

02:46:52.636 --> 02:46:54.571
be done before leases or sign so

02:46:54.638 --> 02:46:56.673
I'm here to strenuously agree

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:58.842
with and support the comment no

02:46:58.909 --> 02:47:00.611
open I made about.

02:47:00.677 --> 02:47:02.579
Doing that work to know the

02:47:02.646 --> 02:47:03.180
impacts before the leases are

02:47:03.247 --> 02:47:04.615
signed.

02:47:04.681 --> 02:47:05.282
Is important and I think they

02:47:05.349 --> 02:47:07.050
can C. determination with the

02:47:07.117 --> 02:47:08.986
state agencies might be a good

02:47:09.052 --> 02:47:10.687
venue for that.

02:47:10.754 --> 02:47:11.288
I'd also like to echo Jan

02:47:11.355 --> 02:47:13.023
savages comment about the

02:47:13.090 --> 02:47:15.092
quality of information meetings

02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:17.027
and again today you made a

02:47:17.094 --> 02:47:17.728
really great start on that.

02:47:17.794 --> 02:47:19.229
I likewise have been to several

02:47:19.296 --> 02:47:20.964
meetings but it's basically the

02:47:21.031 --> 02:47:22.900
same information we heard the

02:47:22.966 --> 02:47:24.768
previous ones.

02:47:24.835 --> 02:47:26.670
The maximum future expansion

02:47:26.737 --> 02:47:28.772
offshore should be described.

02:47:28.839 --> 02:47:30.807
Due to both the fisheries access

02:47:30.874 --> 02:47:32.743
issues have been addressed in

02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:33.377
the environmental impacts that

02:47:33.443 --> 02:47:34.845
have been discussed earlier.

02:47:34.912 --> 02:47:37.180
So I think this idea about doing

02:47:37.247 --> 02:47:39.149
a ten tower project and then

02:47:39.216 --> 02:47:40.851
well if it works out we'll do

02:47:40.918 --> 02:47:41.418
some more.

02:47:41.485 --> 02:47:42.886
Is maybe not the way to

02:47:42.953 --> 02:47:44.922
adequately plan for a project

02:47:44.988 --> 02:47:47.090
that many people are here to

02:47:47.157 --> 02:47:47.791
endorse.

02:47:47.858 --> 02:47:49.026
So mapping the maximum potential

02:47:49.092 --> 02:47:50.694
now would be important.

02:47:50.761 --> 02:47:52.796
I'm here to speak for the

02:47:52.863 --> 02:47:54.665
migratory birds that don't get

02:47:54.731 --> 02:47:55.198
to vote and other wildlife

02:47:55.265 --> 02:47:55.899
generally.

02:47:55.966 --> 02:47:57.034
And I hope they should be given

02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:57.634
full consideration along with

02:47:57.701 --> 02:48:00.671
the human economic impacts

02:48:00.737 --> 02:48:01.238
including.

02:48:01.305 --> 02:48:02.739
Fishing and the other --

02:48:02.806 --> 02:48:04.841
Livelihoods that people have the

02:48:04.908 --> 02:48:05.442
I. concerns of thank you for

02:48:05.509 --> 02:48:06.109
your time.

02:48:06.176 --> 02:48:07.077
Patricia refer your here today

02:48:07.144 --> 02:48:08.712
thinks ring with us along.

02:48:08.779 --> 02:48:10.781
Good afternoon ma'am it's good

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:11.415
to see you thank you so much for

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:12.716
being here.

02:48:12.783 --> 02:48:13.417
Hi I'm Stephanie did well

02:48:13.483 --> 02:48:15.118
executive director of friends of

02:48:15.185 --> 02:48:16.720
the river.

02:48:16.787 --> 02:48:18.855
And organization adamantly

02:48:18.922 --> 02:48:20.958
vehemently agrees that we need a

02:48:21.024 --> 02:48:22.993
bold action to draw down our

02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:25.195
reliance on climate destroying

02:48:25.262 --> 02:48:26.797
fossil fuels.

02:48:26.863 --> 02:48:28.665
That said we have some serious

02:48:28.732 --> 02:48:29.232
concerns about the potential

02:48:29.299 --> 02:48:32.703
impacts of this project.

02:48:32.769 --> 02:48:33.337
I think in its its worst case

02:48:33.403 --> 02:48:36.673
scenario -- These a floating

02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:37.274
offshore wind farms have the

02:48:37.341 --> 02:48:38.976
potential to cause pretty

02:48:39.042 --> 02:48:40.844
significant harm to both.

02:48:40.911 --> 02:48:43.013
Aquatic an avian life and I'm

02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:45.148
I'm encouraged to hear that the

02:48:45.215 --> 02:48:46.883
this is a long term plan that

02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:48.685
people are going into this

02:48:48.752 --> 02:48:51.021
looking at citing in mitigation

02:48:51.088 --> 02:48:51.688
very carefully.

02:48:51.755 --> 02:48:53.056
But I just I want to put this

02:48:53.123 --> 02:48:54.925
back in the context of of this

02:48:54.992 --> 02:48:57.327
region and the greater home okay

02:48:57.394 --> 02:48:58.829
region.

02:48:58.895 --> 02:48:59.496
And the fact that we are doing

02:48:59.563 --> 02:49:00.998
so much restoration work right

02:49:01.064 --> 02:49:03.133
now to save our some on it's

02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:04.868
species we're taking out dams

02:49:04.935 --> 02:49:06.803
were doing estuary restoration

02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:07.504
and yet.

02:49:07.571 --> 02:49:08.872
Our salmon are still struggling

02:49:08.939 --> 02:49:11.141
our our our fisheries in general

02:49:11.208 --> 02:49:12.909
are still struggling in our

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:14.778
fishermen are struggling as we

02:49:14.845 --> 02:49:15.379
deal with things like the the

02:49:15.445 --> 02:49:16.947
early closure.

02:49:17.014 --> 02:49:21.018
On crabbing and so when we start

02:49:21.084 --> 02:49:22.919
looking at adding in what.

02:49:22.986 --> 02:49:24.988
Everyone in this room it minutes

02:49:25.055 --> 02:49:25.589
or potentially significant

02:49:25.656 --> 02:49:28.892
environmental impacts to a

02:49:28.959 --> 02:49:33.030
region that has historically

02:49:33.096 --> 02:49:34.831
been.

02:49:34.898 --> 02:49:35.399
A salmon stronghold in the

02:49:35.465 --> 02:49:36.833
struggling.

02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:37.501
I have to question where this

02:49:37.567 --> 02:49:39.302
fits in our long term thinking

02:49:39.369 --> 02:49:41.171
in terms of truly sustainable

02:49:41.238 --> 02:49:41.872
energy.

02:49:41.938 --> 02:49:44.808
And I I look forward to engaging

02:49:44.875 --> 02:49:46.977
in seeing how this goes but I do

02:49:47.044 --> 02:49:47.677
think that we need.

02:49:47.744 --> 02:49:49.212
To really think of in the local

02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:50.847
context.

02:49:50.914 --> 02:49:53.083
For how are we going to savor

02:49:53.150 --> 02:49:55.018
salmon and what is the

02:49:55.085 --> 02:49:57.054
significance of the impacts of

02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.822
the supposed to it.

02:49:58.889 --> 02:49:59.456
Thank you thank you thank you

02:49:59.523 --> 02:50:00.123
for your testimony today and

02:50:00.190 --> 02:50:01.224
again thank you for being here

02:50:01.291 --> 02:50:02.959
with us for so long as well.

02:50:03.026 --> 02:50:06.830
Thank you so much.

02:50:06.897 --> 02:50:08.865
Good afternoon and welcome. For

02:50:08.932 --> 02:50:09.533
yes Monning.

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:11.001
Senator McGuire and now Mister

02:50:11.068 --> 02:50:11.635
west low for bringing everyone

02:50:11.702 --> 02:50:12.836
here together.

02:50:12.903 --> 02:50:14.905
My name is Mary Collins I'm a

02:50:14.971 --> 02:50:15.605
visiting scholar at the

02:50:15.672 --> 02:50:17.174
California institute for energy

02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:18.942
environment and I also direct

02:50:19.009 --> 02:50:20.944
the American jobs project -- And

02:50:21.011 --> 02:50:23.080
we recently wrote a report

02:50:23.146 --> 02:50:25.082
collaboration actually many

02:50:25.148 --> 02:50:26.817
people in the room collaborated

02:50:26.883 --> 02:50:27.451
on this report now which I'm

02:50:27.517 --> 02:50:30.787
very grateful -- For and we

02:50:30.854 --> 02:50:31.488
looked at this opportunity that

02:50:31.555 --> 02:50:33.223
we have to build a new industry

02:50:33.290 --> 02:50:35.125
from the ground up and and

02:50:35.192 --> 02:50:37.027
asking how we're gonna do this

02:50:37.094 --> 02:50:37.661
in a way that's gonna create.

02:50:37.728 --> 02:50:40.797
Win win solutions for the

02:50:40.864 --> 02:50:42.866
environments for fishermen --

02:50:42.933 --> 02:50:45.168
You know and for labor -- Really

02:50:45.235 --> 02:50:47.037
to spark a new wave of

02:50:47.104 --> 02:50:48.839
innovation in our state.

02:50:48.905 --> 02:50:50.974
And as I sit here today I see

02:50:51.041 --> 02:50:53.143
that we have a lot of work to do
--

02:50:53.210 --> 02:50:55.145
And you know we need to have

02:50:55.212 --> 02:50:56.880
investment from the state of

02:50:56.947 --> 02:50:57.547
California so we can do the

02:50:57.614 --> 02:50:59.216
study so we can start to build

02:50:59.282 --> 02:51:01.084
these process sees -- And really

02:51:01.151 --> 02:51:03.320
create meaningful connections

02:51:03.386 --> 02:51:04.955
with -- You know the U. K.

02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:05.555
that's been brought up today

02:51:05.622 --> 02:51:06.890
there's a lot of great key

02:51:06.957 --> 02:51:09.092
studies there administer clear

02:51:09.159 --> 02:51:09.726
Perry just had her.

02:51:09.793 --> 02:51:11.261
Off shore hurt but the Osher

02:51:11.328 --> 02:51:13.130
when sector deal that came out

02:51:13.196 --> 02:51:13.730
that looks at the supply side

02:51:13.797 --> 02:51:15.132
and they want.

02:51:15.198 --> 02:51:17.033
To share information and

02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:17.701
knowledge with California in a

02:51:17.767 --> 02:51:19.236
meaningful way we've got a lot

02:51:19.302 --> 02:51:21.404
to learn we also have a lot to

02:51:21.471 --> 02:51:22.105
potentially offer.

02:51:22.172 --> 02:51:25.208
Their industry -- So I just want

02:51:25.275 --> 02:51:27.010
to conclude with the fact that

02:51:27.077 --> 02:51:28.912
you know this is an enormous

02:51:28.979 --> 02:51:29.579
opportunity to build this new

02:51:29.646 --> 02:51:31.047
industry from the ground up --

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:33.350
And I'd be happy to share case

02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:35.152
studies that we've been looking

02:51:35.218 --> 02:51:35.852
out over the years with

02:51:35.919 --> 02:51:37.320
successes from the offshore wind

02:51:37.387 --> 02:51:39.256
industry and hope that we can

02:51:39.322 --> 02:51:41.024
continue this conversation in a

02:51:41.091 --> 02:51:41.725
meaningful way.

02:51:41.791 --> 02:51:43.326
I would love M. is Connie thank

Thank you so much for joining us

02:51:49.065 --> 02:51:54.905
today thank you good afternoon

02:51:54.971 --> 02:51:55.572
thank you so much for being here

02:51:55.639 --> 02:51:57.274
the floor source you have two

02:51:57.340 --> 02:51:59.109
minutes okay thank you our my

02:51:59.176 --> 02:51:59.809

for the humble bay harbor

02:52:02.112 --> 02:52:02.512
recreation and conservation

02:52:02.579 --> 02:52:03.046
district.

02:52:03.113 --> 02:52:03.647
And also the community

02:52:03.713 --> 02:52:04.247
development and resilience

02:52:04.314 --> 02:52:05.215
director for the blue lake

02:52:05.282 --> 02:52:06.950
rancheria tried so.

02:52:07.017 --> 02:52:09.019
Juggling two hats here -- Like

02:52:09.085 --> 02:52:11.154
everyone is that a good thank

02:52:11.221 --> 02:52:13.156
you for this -- Holding this

02:52:13.223 --> 02:52:13.824
form and holding a hearing

02:52:13.890 --> 02:52:17.093
Eureka as you're well aware of

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:17.694
any kind of development.

02:52:17.761 --> 02:52:19.029
You're on the north coast

02:52:19.095 --> 02:52:21.198
requires frequent and meaningful

02:52:21.264 --> 02:52:22.999
stakeholder consultation and

02:52:23.066 --> 02:52:25.068
engagement so appreciate that.

02:52:25.135 --> 02:52:27.103
Especially with the fishermen

02:52:27.170 --> 02:52:30.907
with the tribes with labor and

02:52:30.974 --> 02:52:33.210
everyone else here -- There's

02:52:33.276 --> 02:52:35.011
been a lot of dressed here I

02:52:35.078 --> 02:52:35.612
agree and believe that any

02:52:35.679 --> 02:52:37.314
development must be taken

02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:39.416
carefully with the needs of the

02:52:39.482 --> 02:52:41.051
current stakeholders in mind

02:52:41.117 --> 02:52:43.220
especially with the fishermen.

02:52:43.286 --> 02:52:45.288
Including -- In port development

02:52:45.355 --> 02:52:47.157
of which there is the

02:52:47.224 --> 02:52:48.959
opportunity to do a lot we have.

02:52:49.025 --> 02:52:50.994
Unused infrastructure here at

02:52:51.061 --> 02:52:51.695
that.

02:52:51.761 --> 02:52:53.163
Could use an influx of money in

02:52:53.230 --> 02:52:54.998
an influx of development and

02:52:55.065 --> 02:52:55.699
jobs but all that needs to be

02:52:55.765 --> 02:52:57.234
done compatible with the fishing

02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:58.969
industry.

02:52:59.035 --> 02:52:59.669
And not just not bringing harm

02:52:59.736 --> 02:53:01.338
but also bringing benefit and I

02:53:01.404 --> 02:53:03.240
think there's ways that can be

02:53:03.306 --> 02:53:05.141
done to do that.

02:53:05.208 --> 02:53:09.145
And I just wanna and with what.

02:53:09.212 --> 02:53:09.779
Hasn't been said and probably

02:53:09.846 --> 02:53:11.014
everyone considers doesn't

02:53:11.081 --> 02:53:13.250
doesn't need saying but I still

02:53:13.316 --> 02:53:15.018
think you know one of our

02:53:15.085 --> 02:53:17.287
biggest impacts out there is

02:53:17.354 --> 02:53:17.954
ocean acidification.

02:53:18.021 --> 02:53:19.256
And ocean warming and the only

02:53:19.322 --> 02:53:21.224
way we're going to have any

02:53:21.291 --> 02:53:23.493
chance of slowing that down
even.

02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:25.428
Reversing that but just slowing

02:53:25.495 --> 02:53:27.397
down those horrific impacts to

02:53:27.464 --> 02:53:29.332
the fisheries to life on this

02:53:29.399 --> 02:53:33.069
planet is to a rapid shift.

02:53:33.136 --> 02:53:33.770
Towards renewable energy such as

02:53:33.837 --> 02:53:35.205
this and so.

02:53:35.272 --> 02:53:37.207
I would just encourage everyone

02:53:37.274 --> 02:53:37.841
what we're looking at the M.

02:53:37.907 --> 02:53:41.111
packs. To the environment to

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:43.046
consider the positive impacts

02:53:43.113 --> 02:53:43.647
also for development such as

02:53:43.713 --> 02:53:45.081
this.

02:53:45.148 --> 02:53:47.183
And the positive impact that it

02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:47.884
could have to our fisheries and

02:53:47.951 --> 02:53:49.386
the positive impact that it can

02:53:49.452 --> 02:53:51.388
just have to the quality of our

02:53:51.454 --> 02:53:53.056
life in general.

02:53:53.123 --> 02:53:53.757
Thank you no thank you so much

02:53:53.823 --> 02:53:55.425
as common in your apps the right

02:53:55.492 --> 02:53:57.327
your spot on I in regards ocean

02:53:57.394 --> 02:53:59.162
acidification and how

02:53:59.229 --> 02:54:01.097
challenging it's been -- And

02:54:01.164 --> 02:54:03.233
it's getting worse -- Because of

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:05.101
our reliance on fossil fuels so

02:54:05.168 --> 02:54:05.769
I'm grateful that you made that

02:54:05.835 --> 02:54:07.203
point today as well.

02:54:07.270 --> 02:54:09.072
Thank you so much.

02:54:09.139 --> 02:54:11.207
Good afternoon good afternoon

02:54:11.274 --> 02:54:13.043
senator requires could destroy

02:54:13.109 --> 02:54:15.045
us all can Bates humble

02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:15.712
fisherman's marketing

02:54:15.779 --> 02:54:17.280
association -- My job has been

02:54:17.347 --> 02:54:19.082
representing fishermen.

02:54:19.149 --> 02:54:21.117
Or with land use and zoning and

02:54:21.184 --> 02:54:23.086
planning person spot in.

02:54:23.153 --> 02:54:23.787
Nineteen eighty two on I am a

02:54:23.853 --> 02:54:25.388
couple things to say some of the

02:54:25.455 --> 02:54:27.390
things that no and person

02:54:27.457 --> 02:54:31.027
touched on when you talk about

02:54:31.094 --> 02:54:33.029
the regulations in the matter

02:54:33.096 --> 02:54:35.131
closed areas in California it's

02:54:35.198 --> 02:54:35.832
tremendous.

02:54:35.899 --> 02:54:39.269
The former ticket to to to take

02:54:39.336 --> 02:54:39.970
a felt pen.

02:54:40.036 --> 02:54:41.271
And start blacking in the areas

02:54:41.338 --> 02:54:41.971
off the California coast weather

02:54:42.038 --> 02:54:43.273
is restricted areas are closures

02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:45.308
most of the coast close to Scott

02:54:45.375 --> 02:54:47.210
some sort of encumbrance on it.

02:54:47.277 --> 02:54:51.047
So when when nor talks about

02:54:51.114 --> 02:54:51.748
basically compete in an eminent

02:54:51.815 --> 02:54:53.283
domain essentially these fishing

02:54:53.350 --> 02:54:53.883
areas this is something that

02:54:53.950 --> 02:54:55.352
fishermen are so extremely

02:54:55.418 --> 02:54:57.354
conservative and considered.

02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:59.389
The word about there's really no

02:54:59.456 --> 02:55:00.023
place to go.

02:55:00.090 --> 02:55:01.491
By the same token fishermen

02:55:01.558 --> 02:55:03.493
understand that these projects

02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:05.095
have to go forward so.

02:55:05.161 --> 02:55:07.230
The trick is to try to find a

02:55:07.297 --> 02:55:07.931
balance home office Sherman's

02:55:07.997 --> 02:55:09.366
marketing association has about

02:55:09.432 --> 02:55:11.568
a year's worth of dialogue with.

02:55:11.634 --> 02:55:13.470
A principal power in with our

02:55:13.536 --> 02:55:15.271
local energy provider through

02:55:15.338 --> 02:55:15.972
Matthew Marshall here.

02:55:16.039 --> 02:55:17.741
And we're so we're slowly moving

02:55:17.807 --> 02:55:19.576
along there's a lot to lots of

02:55:19.642 --> 02:55:21.244
work to do.

02:55:21.311 --> 02:55:21.911
On the second thing that I'd

02:55:21.978 --> 02:55:23.380
like to touch on is that a lot

02:55:23.446 --> 02:55:25.148
of people think that these

02:55:25.215 --> 02:55:25.849
impacts to the fishing fleet.

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:27.617
Be it displacement in the ocean

02:55:27.684 --> 02:55:29.686
or displacement on should always

02:55:29.753 --> 02:55:31.521
far shore side facilities or

02:55:31.588 --> 02:55:33.423
something that's going to happen

02:55:33.490 --> 02:55:35.325
in the far distant future.

02:55:35.392 --> 02:55:37.427
And that is actually not correct
--

02:55:37.494 --> 02:55:39.596
It starts immediately with

02:55:39.662 --> 02:55:43.299
planning and essentially for for

02:55:43.366 --> 02:55:47.170
humble Bates it started on the

02:55:47.237 --> 02:55:47.837
particular date all of the

02:55:47.904 --> 02:55:49.506
humble bay harbor district put

02:55:49.572 --> 02:55:51.441
in a request. For a grant to go

02:55:51.508 --> 02:55:53.410
ahead and look at redesigning

02:55:53.476 --> 02:55:55.512
redwood terminal number one

02:55:55.578 --> 02:55:57.347
which is a facility that's 20%

02:55:57.414 --> 02:55:59.549
occupied by the fishing fleet.

02:55:59.616 --> 02:56:03.153
So these things have to be

02:56:03.219 --> 02:56:05.188
planned for way ahead of time.

02:56:05.255 --> 02:56:05.855
Again the trick is fishermen all

02:56:05.922 --> 02:56:09.225
these things are coming and to

02:56:09.292 --> 02:56:11.161
try to minimize the mounting

02:56:11.227 --> 02:56:13.163
impacts to this industry so that

02:56:13.229 --> 02:56:13.797
we can survive.

02:56:13.863 --> 02:56:21.304
Through this and the entire

02:56:21.371 --> 02:56:22.005
state to prosper thank you.

02:56:22.072 --> 02:56:23.239
It's Bates thank you so much and

02:56:23.306 --> 02:56:23.873
thank you for your on going

02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:25.208
after exam behalf the fleet.

02:56:25.275 --> 02:56:25.909
Yeah I would like to be a

02:56:25.975 --> 02:56:27.577
welcome the supervisor at to the

02:56:27.644 --> 02:56:29.279
hearing thank you so much better

02:56:29.345 --> 02:56:29.979
supervisor before about this

02:56:30.046 --> 02:56:31.214
thank you very much senator I'm

02:56:31.281 --> 02:56:31.915
just here to say.

02:56:31.981 --> 02:56:35.151
A huge thank you to you because

02:56:35.218 --> 02:56:35.852
being on the a redwood coast

02:56:35.919 --> 02:56:37.620
energy authority -- Representing

02:56:37.687 --> 02:56:41.458
the county of humble -- We have

02:56:41.524 --> 02:56:43.226
a C. C. E. O. commute --

02:56:43.293 --> 02:56:45.428
Community choice -- G. -- Which

02:56:45.495 --> 02:56:49.299
dedicated itself -- To providing

02:56:49.365 --> 02:56:53.303
1100% clean power by twenty

02:56:53.369 --> 02:56:53.937
twenty five not twenty forty

02:56:54.003 --> 02:56:55.405
five three so we're talking

02:56:55.472 --> 02:56:57.474
about local clean energy but

02:56:57.540 --> 02:56:59.542
also just the concept of

02:56:59.609 --> 02:57:01.511
everybody talking together.

02:57:01.578 --> 02:57:03.680
Is extremely important and there

02:57:03.746 --> 02:57:05.381
were a couple of things

02:57:05.448 --> 02:57:07.317
mentioned I'm also on the

02:57:07.383 --> 02:57:09.185
advisory committee -- For born

02:57:09.252 --> 02:57:09.819
so I'm very well aware of the

02:57:09.886 --> 02:57:11.488
project the process they're

02:57:11.554 --> 02:57:13.389
going through as well but I

02:57:13.456 --> 02:57:15.592
would like to say that there

02:57:15.658 --> 02:57:17.427
were a few things were said that

02:57:17.494 --> 02:57:19.262
really struck me -- Jennifer

02:57:19.329 --> 02:57:21.498
said doing the right thing the

02:57:21.564 --> 02:57:22.198
right way.

02:57:22.265 --> 02:57:23.700
Because we're we're going in the

02:57:23.766 --> 02:57:25.602
right direction and all of the

02:57:25.668 --> 02:57:27.704
screener G. also protecting the

02:57:27.770 --> 02:57:29.606
environment protection the

02:57:29.672 --> 02:57:31.541
fisheries so we've got a

02:57:31.608 --> 02:57:33.643
wonderful wonderful task ahead

02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:34.344
of us.

02:57:34.410 --> 02:57:35.612
The challenge is great but it's

02:57:35.678 --> 02:57:37.514
very very exciting so I really

02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:39.716
hope we we continue with these.

02:57:39.782 --> 02:57:47.290
Nine anything you put together

02:57:47.357 --> 02:57:49.359
I'm right there Anderson -- Also

02:57:49.425 --> 02:57:51.261
I think the idea of offshore

02:57:51.327 --> 02:57:53.263
wind and and I'm a great fan of

02:57:53.329 --> 02:57:53.963
these guys that are doing this

02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:55.431
clean energy have been following

02:57:55.498 --> 02:57:56.099
them in Europe central.

02:57:56.166 --> 02:57:57.567
But the idea that they are the

02:57:57.634 --> 02:57:59.502
new stake holders I think was a

02:57:59.569 --> 02:58:01.337
a really good one mentioned by

02:58:01.404 --> 02:58:03.473
and because when a lot of times.

02:58:03.540 --> 02:58:05.508
Something is going forward it's

02:58:05.575 --> 02:58:07.277
got a lot of energy it's a big

02:58:07.343 --> 02:58:09.345
movement and you say we need to

02:58:09.412 --> 02:58:11.414
include the stake holders -- And

02:58:11.481 --> 02:58:13.283
it's kind of like Wilk who were

02:58:13.349 --> 02:58:15.318
at the stake holders well.

02:58:15.385 --> 02:58:15.952
There to stake holders in our

02:58:16.019 --> 02:58:17.554
environment and we need to

02:58:17.620 --> 02:58:19.622
include them but we also need to

02:58:19.689 --> 02:58:21.558
work very closely together so I

02:58:21.624 --> 02:58:23.459
just want to say a very big

02:58:23.526 --> 02:58:24.160
thank you to you.

02:58:24.227 --> 02:58:25.762
I put myself to working as hard

02:58:25.828 --> 02:58:27.697
as I can to make sure this works

02:58:27.764 --> 02:58:29.365
no I appreciate that ma'am

02:58:29.432 --> 02:58:30.033

feedback and just know.

02:59:09.806 --> 02:59:11.708
This is just the beginning just

02:59:11.774 --> 02:59:13.509
the beginning of this process or

02:59:13.576 --> 02:59:15.378
we want to be able to formalize

02:59:15.445 --> 02:59:16.079

Senate sergeants were here today

03:00:19.876 --> 03:00:21.611
for all their work.

03:00:21.678 --> 03:00:23.546
Find the ladies and gentlemen I

03:00:23.613 --> 03:00:25.581
want to leave with a few words.

03:00:25.648 --> 03:00:27.550
Number one is early number two

03:00:27.617 --> 03:00:29.552
is often we need to be

03:00:29.619 --> 03:00:31.587
communicating early about this

03:00:31.654 --> 03:00:32.188
issue we need to be

03:00:32.255 --> 03:00:33.756
communicating often about

03:00:33.823 --> 03:00:35.658
offshore wind energy.

03:00:35.725 --> 03:00:39.529
It we need to get together as a

03:00:39.595 --> 03:00:40.229
group get in front of this to be

03:00:40.296 --> 03:00:41.798
able to formalize the process.

03:00:41.864 --> 03:00:43.933
And I'd like to be able to end

03:00:43.1000 --> 03:00:45.535
it as I started.

03:00:45.601 --> 03:00:47.570
We need to expedite the work of

03:00:47.637 --> 03:00:49.505
the task force that was created

03:00:49.572 --> 03:00:50.173
by both the federal and state

03:00:50.239 --> 03:00:51.874
governments to put meat on the

03:00:51.941 --> 03:00:52.542
bone.

03:00:52.608 --> 03:00:53.976
Meat on the bone when it comes

03:00:54.043 --> 03:00:55.578
to the rules and regulations to

03:00:55.645 --> 03:00:57.647
protect fishing grounds and our

03:00:57.714 --> 03:00:59.615
coastal environment where

03:00:59.682 --> 03:01:00.283
turbines would be located.

03:01:00.350 --> 03:01:03.586
As we know as we heard in many

03:01:03.653 --> 03:01:05.488
cases turbines would be placed

03:01:05.555 --> 03:01:07.490
at where there are high winds

03:01:07.557 --> 03:01:09.592
which also could coincide with

03:01:09.659 --> 03:01:10.293
up weld waters.

03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:11.828
In these waters have high levels

03:01:11.894 --> 03:01:13.696
of nutrients which mean there

03:01:13.763 --> 03:01:14.363
are high levels of foods or

03:01:14.430 --> 03:01:15.932
foods from sources which means

03:01:15.998 --> 03:01:19.502
our robust fisheries and marine

03:01:19.569 --> 03:01:20.136
life in the same locations or

03:01:20.203 --> 03:01:21.838
potential turbines would be

03:01:21.904 --> 03:01:23.539
located.

03:01:23.606 --> 03:01:24.240
There are several follow ups

03:01:24.307 --> 03:01:27.610
including learning from -- What

03:01:27.677 --> 03:01:29.612
is happened in the past so that

03:01:29.679 --> 03:01:31.514
we do not repeat those mistakes

03:01:31.581 --> 03:01:33.616
in the future -- And also

03:01:33.683 --> 03:01:34.283
learning what has worked in the

03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:35.985
past so we can replicate those

03:01:36.052 --> 03:01:37.954
issues in the future here on the

03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:39.555
north coast.

03:01:39.622 --> 03:01:41.524

03:01:42.258 --> 03:01:43.526

03:02:02.345 --> 03:02:02.845
this will look like here on the

03:02:02.912 --> 03:02:03.646
north coast.
