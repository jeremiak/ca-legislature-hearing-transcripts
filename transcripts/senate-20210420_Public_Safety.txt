NOW BECAUSE OF DECADES OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE AROUND IMMUNOLOGY WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING THIS PANDEMIC TO A CLOSE. WE'RE FINALLY STARTING TO SAFELY REOPEN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT ALL THIS MAY BE LOST IF WE DON'T GET ENOUGH PEOPLE VACCINATED. WELL THE FEDERAL STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING BETTER AND BETTER EACH DAY DISTURBING THE COVER NINETEEN VACCINES IN EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE VACCINE. ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS THAT WE ARE ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH HERE ARE ESCALATING THEIR TACTICS TO ACTUALLY DISRUPT AND STOP THESE EFFORTS. AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR SB SEVEN FORTY TWO. SO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE FREE SPEECH. YEAH AND MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE MORE TOOLS TO ENSURE PATIENTS IN FRONT LINE WORKERS AT VACCINE CLINICS ARE SAFE FROM INTIMIDATION HARASSMENT AND PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION. MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE SHUTDOWN OF THE VACCINE CLINIC IN JANUARY AT DODGER STADIUM WHERE A MOB OF ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS STOPPED. THE CLINIC FROM OPERATING. WELL THEY SCREAM MASSLESS AT VULNERABLE PEOPLE WAITING THEIR CARS TO GET VACCINATED JEOPARDIZING THE SAFETY PATIENTS AND FRONTLINE WORKERS. BUT THESE EXTREMISTS ARE ALSO PLANNING SIMILAR OP SIMILAR OPERATIONS ALL OVER THE STATE OFTEN TRYING TO BLEND IN THIS FRONT LINE WORKERS AND DISRUPT OPERATIONS EVEN RESORT TO TACTICS LIKE TARGETING FARMWORKERS AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST FOR ANY HEAVILY IMPACT OF NINETEEN. AND NEED A VACCINE THE MOST. ADDITIONALLY WHAT WE'RE JUST BACKS INTRODUCE HEALTHCARE SPACES LIKE HOSPITALS DOCTORS OFFICES AND PHARMACIES WE ARE ALSO USING NONTRADITIONAL LOCATIONS LIKE STADIUM SCHOOL CAMPUSES PARKING LOTS. US POP UP CLINICS IN NEIGHBORHOODS BACK MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AT A TIME OF CREATING NEW LOGISTICS SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT BE A BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. THE PHONE INTO THE BILL WILL FALSELY CLAIM WERE TAKEAWAYS. THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE THEY WANT TO BOXES INTO. WE CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FREE SPEECH WITHOUT DISRUPTING ACCESS TO VACCINES FOR PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO GET THEM. TODAY HAVE TWO WITNESSES DR TOOL MUKASEY PRIME A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR AT THE MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR OUTPATIENT CENTER IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES.

SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT PUTTING THE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH THAT WE WILL NOT OBSTRUCTION INTIMIDATION HOSTILITY AND HARASSMENT OF THE DIVISIONAL BARRIERS FOR PATIENTS WHO NEED THE VACCINE AND THAT BILL IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE RIGHT TO SPEECH BUT IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT TO LIFE.

THE SUPPORT WOULD FOR SIX MINUTES AND FORTY SEVEN SECONDS CAN I PLEASE HAVE A THREE MINUTES TWENTY SECONDS I'LL GIVE YOU THREE MINUTES TWENTY SECONDS. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS JOSHUA COLEMAN I LIVE IN ROSEVILLE AND CO FOUNDER OF V. IS FOR VACCINE. THE LARGEST VACCINE RISK PUBLIC AWARENESS EDUCATION ORGANIZATION. OUR CAMPAIGN IS BEING USED AROUND THE WORLD AND IN ALL FIFTY STATES. I SHOULD MENTION I DON'T FEEL SENSUAL OILS FOLLOW Q. AND ON AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE WORLD IS FLAT. I HAVE TWO SONS BOTH HAVE BEEN VACCINATED. MY OLDEST SON AUTO EXPERIENCED AN ADVERSE TO. ADD ADVERSE REACTION TO VACCINES. CALLED TRANSVERSE MYELITIS HE IS NOW PARALYZED FROM THE WAIST DOWN. AND CONFINED TO A WHEELCHAIR FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. I WAS NEVER INFORMED AN INJURY LIKE THIS WAS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE REGARDLESS OF THE TRANSVERSE MYELITIS WAS LISTED IN THE ANSWER TO THE VACCINES HE WAS GIVEN. AND IS ALSO ON THE GOVERNMENT'S VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM LIST OF COMPENSABLE INJURIES. I DIDN'T RECEIVE APPROPRIATE INFORMED CONSENT. BEFORE ALLOWED AUTO TO BE VACCINATED AND SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN ON A MISSION TO BETTER EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. ABOUT THE REAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH VACCINATION. THE VACCINE PROGRAM LIKE ALL THINGS IN THIS WORLD ISN'T PERFECT. AND THERE IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO BE HAD OFFERING LITTLE KNOWN YET FACTUAL INFORMATION ON VACCINES NEAR WHERE VACCINATIONS ARE GIVEN IS ONE OF THE WAYS. WE RAISE AWARENESS ON THE SUBJECT. THERE ARE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND PHARMACIES IN CALIFORNIA. ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED HOSPITALS AND WHEN YOU INCLUDE PRIVATE PRACTICES CLINICS COVERED NINETEEN VACCINATION SITES. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OVER TEN THOUSAND LOCATIONS IN THIS IN THIS STATE WHERE IF THIS BILL IS PASSED. CALIFORNIANS WILL BE SEVERELY LIMITED IN THEIR RIGHT TO PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE AND EXERCISE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. THIS IS A VERY EXTREME LEGISLATION AND COMPLETELY VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WOMEN WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE LIMITED WHERE THEY COULD PROTEST FOR THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE OR AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE LIMITED TO WHERE THEY COULD PROTEST AGAINST SEGREGATION. WHERE WOULD WE BE NOW. THE DODGER STADIUM INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE ON JANUARY THIRTIETH THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT WAS INCORRECTLY REPORTED ON SAYING ACTIVISTS HAD BLOCKED PEOPLE FROM BEING VACCINATED. THERE WERE POLICE ON SITE AND L. A. COUNTY CHIEF OF POLICE MICHAEL MOORE MADE A PUBLIC STATEMENT SAYING THE POLICE DID NOT SHUT DOWN THE VACCINATION SITE. ALL APPOINTMENTS ARE BEING MET. CNN REPORTED THE GATHERING WAS PEACEFUL AND NO ARRESTS WERE MADE ALSO STATING NO APPOINTMENTS WERE CANCELLED. HALF THE CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE COVERED NINETEEN SHOT AND THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE INCIDENT WHERE ACTIVISTS DISRUPTED A COVERT NINETEEN VACCINATION AREA PREVENTING VACCINATIONS FROM HAPPENING. AS OF NOW IF PROTESTERS GO OUT AND ACTUALLY BLOCK A VACCINATION AREA. THEY CAN BE ARRESTED WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS IN PLACE WHERE IT'S ILLEGAL TO DO THAT. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IS FOR THIS BILL IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT NEEDED TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DOING SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY AGAINST THE LAW. PLEASE VOTE DOWN SB SEVEN FOUR TWO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NOW WILL MOVE TO THE MATH FOR YOU MACKERELS WHO'S ON THE PHONE LINE. HELLO GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIR. SO THE COMMITTEE.

THAT'S RESULT OPERATIVE SEX WOULD CRIMINALIZE ALL MANNER OF PROTEST. AT THE VACCINE COULD WITH THAT COST. WHETHER THAT BE RETAIL INSTEAD. BUT AT LEAST ONE WE CURRENTLY OF WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LABOR PICKETING BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS OR EVEN THE RIGHT TO LIFE PICKETING OUTSIDE OF ABORTION CLINICS DID WE DOUBT THAT THE AUTHOR INTENDED THOSE CONSEQUENCES BUT THEY ARE THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE CURRENT PROPERTY TAX AND THEREFORE WE WOULD STRONGLY URGE AMENDMENTS. TO REMOVE THE MENTION OF PICKETING- AS WELL AS TO FOCUS THE BILL ONE- AWAY FROM. TARGETING COOPERATIVE TECH. STATE ANY CURRENT FORM THE BILL GOES SETTLEMENT.

AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU- WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CENTER WIENER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- WHICH I SUPPORT- AND OFFERS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP IN THE FACE OF PERSONAL ATTACKS AND PHYSICAL ASSAULTS AND- ALL SORTS OF OTHER HARASSMENT ON TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE CAN PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S FOR MEASLES OR WHETHER IT'S FROM COVE IN NINETEEN- AND WHEN WE LOOK AT ABOUT THE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC I THINK WE CHOSE TO THREE MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. WHO HAVE DIED FOR GOOD FROM CO THERE WERE A I THINK WHAT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OR THEREABOUTS. IN THE UNITED STATES ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND OR SO PEOPLE HAVE DIED- IN CALIFORNIA- AND IN THE MIDST OF IT WE HAVE. WHO ARE- DID. DENY THAT THIS VIRUS EVEN EXISTS OR THINK IT'S JUST LIKE THE COMMON COLD. AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT. THE WAY THAT THIS COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD HAVE BEEN TORN APART. BY THIS PANDEMIC NOTCHES ECONOMICALLY- BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TORN APART PEOPLE DIED. PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS VIRUS AND I'M NOT RECOVERED A YEAR LATER AND MAY HAVE PERMANENT- INJURIES AS A RESULT. OF THIS VIRUS- IT IS. PARTS OF THE GLOBAL HEALTH DISASTER THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A VERY. VERY VERY LONG TIME- AND WE KNOW THAT VACCINATION IS HOW WE GET OUT OF THIS. AND THEN IT- SEND YOUR PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE WHATEVER OPINION THEY WANT TO HAVE. ONE ON THE VACCINE EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN OPINION. AND WE NO ONE'S BEING FORCED. TO GET VACCINATED- BUT WHEN YOU START INTERFERING WITH THE ABILITY OF OTHER PEOPLE. TO GET VACCINATED DOTS WHEN YOU CROSS THE LINE. YOUR CALL ASSEMBLY YOU CROSS THE LINE POINTING TO MAKE STATEMENTS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD GET VACCINATED PEOPLE CAN PEOPLE YEAH I DISAGREE I DISAGREE WITH OTHER PEOPLE CAN MAKE THAT STATEMENT. BUT WHEN YOU START PHYSICALLY IMPEDING THE ABILITY OF OTHER PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED- YOU ARE CROSSING A LINE AND THAT IS NOT FIRST AMENDMENT. ACTIVITY UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE THIS CONTINUING CASCADE OF PEOPLE HAVING THEIR OWN DEEPLY HELD VIEWS BUT THEN TRYING TO. HAVING OUR OWN DEEPLY HELD VIEWS ABOUT WHETHER OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD SEEK HEALTH CARE WHETHER IT'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE VACCINATIONS AND INSTEAD OF SIMPLY HAVING OR SPELLS IN THAT VIEW. AND SAID THE INSIDE OF THE SENATE THEY DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO GET THAT HEALTHCARE. THEY ARE. TRY TO PREVENT AND HARASS AND INTIMIDATE THOSE PEOPLE FROM GETTING HEALTHCARE WHETHER IT'S WOMEN WHO ARE SEEKING REPRODUCTIVE. HEALTH WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE GETTING A VACCINE AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEONE'S DECISION TO GET HEALTH CARE THAT IS A VERY PERSONAL DECISION. M. IT'S A VERY VERY PERSONAL DECISION AND THE IDEA. FOR ANY OF US ANY KIND OF HEALTH CARE GOING TO YOUR DOCTOR TO A CLINIC OR ANYWHERE AND YOU OTHER PEOPLE GETTING UP IN YOUR FACE TRYING TO PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING OUT HEALTHCARE I'M SORRY THAT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE IT IS DESTRUCTIVE IT IS NOT FIRST AMENDMENT ACTIVITY- AND IT AND IT'S ISN'T IT IS NOT OKAY- AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET HEALTH CARE. YOU CAN YOU CAN DECIDE NOT TO GET THAT THE CODE BAXEEN- BUT BUT STOP OBSTRUCTING OTHER PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO DO SO AND SO I MOVED BILL. DO ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE. CAN SEE NONE DUCK OUT OF THIS A SENATOR OR CHOI BOOK. GOOD AFTERNOON. OR GOOD MORNING ACTIONS HE FEELS LONGER THAN HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE- SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- AND COMMENTS AS WELL BECAUSE I MAY DAY I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO- OF COURSE OUR FIRST AMENDMENT DOES YOU KNOW HAVING OUR OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OURSELVES AND- AND UNDERSTANDING THE- IMPORTANCE OF IT. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR DEMOCRACY. FIRST OF ALL LET ME ASK. FOR SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO DOESN'T HAVE SPECIAL AWARENESS- VERY MUCH- WHAT IS THE- THREE HUNDRED FEET LOOK LIKE IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING FOR INSTANCE IS IT FROM HERE TO THAT DOOR- WHAT EXACTLY THIS THREE HUNDRED DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THREE HUNDRED FEET LOOK LIKE. ALL THE- AT THE FOOTBALL FIELD YEAH BERMAN AND TO THE OTHER END YOU ARE. OKAY SO IT WOULD BE I'M ASSUMING IT'S DEEPER THAN THIS BUILDING. IS THAT CORRECT BUT CERTAIN DOUBLE SLEEPER THAN THIS ROOM BUT- YES OKAY BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT YOU CAN SHOUT FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM. AT THE FRONT AS WE WITNESS STAND PAST HEARINGS. OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS- WITH REGARDS TO I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT IN DODGER STADIUM FOR THE PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCTED THE ENTRANCE BUT THERE WERE OVER THREE HUNDRED FEET PERHAPS AWAY FROM SOMETHING VACCINATION THE ACTUAL PLACE WHAT TOOK PLACE. OKAY I HAVE- OKAY SO THE- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS WITH REGARDS TO- THE PRIVACY OF HEALTH- AND HOW DOES THAT COMBINED WITH- THE ABILITY TO GET THE VACCINES THAT HAVE THAT PRIVACY HAVE A- NOTION IN PLACE- AND THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE- THE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS AND HAVE THAT FREEDOM TO ASSEMBLE. HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH REGARDS TO THE PRIVACY OF THE HAVE. PATIENTS COMING IN AND GETTING VACCINATED. WELL SO THE CHALLENGE WOULD BE IS THAT YOU HAVE- THE PEOPLE WISH TO DISRUPT- THEY WILL USE A VARIETY OF TACTICS TO TRY TO BULLY AND INTIMIDATE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO GET THE VACCINE- THEY COULD TRY TO ACTUALLY TAKE PICTURES OF THEM AND POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO THERE BY VIOLATING THE PRIVACY- THEY YEAH CERTAINLY- SAID WE ACTUALLY WITNESSED I'M GOING RIGHT UP TO PEOPLE'S. A CAR SELL IT OVER DOCTOR STADIUM. SHOUTING AT THEM AND BASS BUT CERTAINLY IN VISUAL RANGE AND- DOWNSTAIRS PHOTOS WERE TAKEN AS WELL SO I THINK THERE IS A PRIVACY RISK AS WELL DEPENDING ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DISRUPT AND- I THINK- WE'VE SEEN TO ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS USER ID DIFFERENT TACTICS TO TRY TO. BULLY AND INTIMIDATE AND- PEOPLE FROM ACTUALLY PURSUING THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE CHOICES. SO I'M I'M I'M VERY CAUTIOUS BECAUSE I AM VERY- I HAVE MET WITH MANY PARENTS WHO ARE- WHO HAVE UNFORTUNATELY- HAD CHILDREN WHO HAD HAD ADVERSE REACTIONS TO VACCINES- YOU KNOW I AM A PARENT WHO CHOSE TO HAVE MY PARENT MY HILDREN VACCINATED- SO I'M VERY I'M VERY. SENSITIVE AND VERY EMPATHETIC TO BOTH BOTH SIDES AS TO HAVING THE OPTION OF BEING VACCINATING TO PARENTS WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BECAUSE OF THE- THE HISTORY AREN'T THERE- GENETIC PRE. DISPOSITIONS TO ADVERSE REACTIONS TO VACCINES SO. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE- WITH THIS BILL I FEEL THAT BOTH ON THE PROTECTION OF THE OF THE PATIENTS COMING IN- AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED THEIR PRIVACY IS PROTECTED AND SO FORTH. I ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND IN TRYING TO GET THAT PRIVACY ELEMENT COMPONENT ON THAT END- BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT. THIS BILL DOESN'T NECESSARILY. PROHIBIT SOMEONE FROM EXPRESSING OR OR SHARING THEIR PERSPECTIVE OR THEIR VIEWS IT'S JUST IT'S CREATING A BUFFER SOUND TO CREATE THAT PRIVACY- THAT'S THE WAY THAT I'M READING THE BILL AS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY VERY PROTECTIVE OF OUR OF OUR OUR OUR ABILITY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF IN IT AND ASSEMBLE PROTECTING THAT FIRST AMENDMENT BUT I ALSO SEE THAT AS- WE HAVE TO FIND A LITTLE BIT OF A BALANCE- FOR PEOPLE ONE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASSEMBLE A NUMBER TO HAVE THAT PRIVACY FOR THE PATIENTS. AND I SEE THAT IF THREE HUNDRED FEET SEEMS A LITTLE DAUNTING I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW- FROM THE OPPOSITION AS TO WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO HAVE THAT BALANCE AND I WANT I WANT BOTH SIDES TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THE OPPOSITE- PERSPECTIVE IN AN- AND- POSITIONS. WHEN YOU'RE- A PATIENT. AIRDATE YOU ARE PURSUING INOTES DOCKS NATIONS PER SE IN THIS CASES WERE REFERRED TO BACK THE NATION'S WE WANT THAT- YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WANT ONE TO LET OTHER PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GETTING VACCINATED OTHERPEOPLE WANT TO BE DISCREET A PRIVATE ABOUT IT I THINK WE NEED TO RESPECT THAT- UNDECIDED BUT ALSO FOR HEALTH REASONS AND THAT GOES FOR ANY OF OUR- OUR- OUR- ELEMENTS THAT WE MAY HAVE. BUT ALSO. NOT NOT SAYING THAT WE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO EXPRESS AN ASSEMBLE BUT GIVING THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO AS WELL AND I THINK THIS BILL DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO- IS JUST SAYING THAT. WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF A PRIVACY BUFFER ON THAT END AND IF THERE IS- IN THE LEAD OPPOSITION ON THE LINE I WOULD. BE VERY VERY ADAM CURIOUS TO HEAR THEIR THOUGHTS SIR. AM I ABLE TO RESPOND- MISTER CHAIR. R. YES RUNNING A ONE RESPONSE TO THAT TOO- IS IT TOO. WELL I CERTAINLY IF I MAY I DO THESE DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE. WON'T TAKE YOUR REYNOLDS AGAIN WHAT WOULD BE WHAT WOULD BE NIGHT RESPONSIBLE. THANK SO USUALLY WERE ON THE SIDEWALK NEAR AN ENTRANCE OR WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING AND WE HAVE SIGNS THAT ARE ARE LETTING THEM KNOW ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY PROBABLY DON'T ALREADY KNOW. AND WE HAVE LITERATURE TO- TO GIVE THEM MORE INFORMATION SO THREE HUNDRED FEET REALLY COMPLETELY GETS US OUT OF- THE- LIKE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE ACROSS THE STREET. SO IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO I SEE TARGET TO ME BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS OBVIOUSLY TO GIVE INFORMATION TO PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO GET VACCINATED IF WE WERE ABLE TO BE ACROSS THE STREET. THE WE WE'VE MUCH FURTHER AWAY NOBODY'S CELL PHONES GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHOW ANYBODY'S FACE IN EVERYBODY'S FACES IS PRETTY MUCH MASTERED THEIR CARS I MEAN WHEN THEY'RE COMING INTO A COVER NINETEEN VACCINATION SITE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS A MASK ON IN THEIR CAR SO THEIR IDENTITIES. REALLY I THINK ALREADY PROTECTED BUT- THE THREE HUNDRED FEET THING IS GOING TO KEEP US FROM EVEN BEING ACROSS THE STREET WHICH PUTS US WAY FAR OUT TO A POINT WHERE IT'S HARD FOR US TO GET THIS INFORMATION TO THE PEOPLE COMING IN TO GET VACCINATED. SEVEN MARCH TWENTY MILLION THIRTY SECONDS. THE SUPREME COURT HAS STRUCK DOWN THIRTY FIVE POINT BUFFER ZONES AROUND ABORTION CLINICS SO THE DEAD THREE HUNDRED FIVE BUFFER ZONE IS VERY LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC. I'M SORRY ONE MORE TIME. TO SET TO SEPARATE ORDER STRUCK DOWN A THIRTY FOOT BUFFER AT A PORTION CLINICS AND USES THREE HUNDRED FEET IS PROBLEMATIC. OKAY I WOULD SENATOR PAN DO YOU HAVE ANY- I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS YOUR FEEDBACK AS TO AS TO THAT PERSPECTIVE THAT POINT I JUST POINT OUT THAT- THAT ACTUALLY- FOR ALL THE CLAIMS OF THIS BEING A CONSTITUTIONAL ACTUALLY- IT'S- SOME OF US HAVE BEEN UPHELD BY THE COURTS- NGUYEN ANTI GAY PROTESTERS THE DISTRIBUTED AT FUNERALS FOR FAMILY FOR MILITARY MEMBERS. AND SAID THEIR BUFFER ZONES HAVE BEEN HELPFUL FOR BRICK AND MORTAR CLINICS- SO CERTAINLY- WHAT WE WANNA DO IS PREVENT DISRUPTION RIGHT SO IT'S NOT ABOUT SPEECH ABOUT THIS RUCTIONS YOU POINTED OUT WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO BULLY AND INTIMIDATE AND- OF THE STRIP ABSTRACT SO WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE BEING SCARED AWAY FROM VACCINATION CLINICS BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO BE HARASSED- THE CHECK OUT THE PICTURES TAKEN- THAT- DIDN'T HAVE TO BE UP THEIR PERSONAL IDENTITIES EXPOSED. TO- JUST FOR TRYING TO GET TO A VACCINATION SITE. AND THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. I THINK BURKE. CHAIR I THINK I JUST ON THE CURFEW. PART OF IT AS FAR AS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIRTY FIVE. FOOT- WHAT A WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT END. BUT I THINK THE ISSUE IS GOING TO BE- ESPECIALLY. BECAUSE WE HAVE A RIGHT TO DIFFERENT SITES SO FOR AND AGAIN WHETHER- AND FOR CERTAINLY THE OPPOSING CLAIMS YES STRONGLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE BE MASKS BUT THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT WAYS I MEAN EVEN WITH THE MASK YOU CAN STILL IDENTIFY PEOPLE- DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE AND HOW CLOSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GET TO PEOPLE IN THE USED TELEPHOTO LENS IT CETERA. SO WE WANT ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS AT THINK AS YOU SAID- CENTER THAT. THIS IS pPEOPLE FOR EXPRESSING THEIR POINTS OF VIEW IT'S ABOUT BEING SURE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT GET BULLIED OR HARASSED IN TRYING TO GET. THEIR VACCINES. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A TYPE OF TACTICS THAT WE SAW IN DODGERS STADIUM AND THOSE ARE TYPES TACTICS YOU SEE THEM TRY TO POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THEY WANT TO DO- INCLUDING MISTER COLEMAN HERE. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT. OUR THERE'S A QUESTION OR CONCERN TO ALL RIGHT- DOCTRINE TOWARD CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIR BRADFORD- I FIND IT QUITE TELLING THAT THE LEAD WITNESSES ACTUALLY A MAN WHO I NOT ONLY- HAS- PERSONALLY ACTUALLY FOLLOWED ME HER PERSONALLY TO. NOT ONLY HERE IN THE CAPITAL BY THE WAY AND SCOTT AND CERTAINLY MUCH CLOSER TO THIRTY FIVE FEET RIGHT UP IN MY FACE- BUT ALSO AS TRAVEL TO NEW YORK IN DC AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO PERSONALLY HARASSED ME BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME. THIS IS ABOUT VACCINATION SITES AND SO- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT HE THAT WE DO HAVE A PLANS FROM PEOPLE INCLUDING ACTION MISTER COLEMAN TO TRY TO GO TO VACCINATION SITES AND- IT'S AND BASICALLY- CAUSE TROUBLE AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE- PROTECT. PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO TO THE VACCINATIONS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD TO PROTECT OUR TO ME THEY TALKED ABOUT. THE ROLE OF VACCINATIONS BRING US HOPE. BECAUSE HOPE SO THAT WE CAN. GET THEY'LL REOPEN OUR BUSINESSES GET OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SO THAT WE CAN GO AND BE ABLE TO VISIT OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT SO WE WANT TO BEGIN THE COULD USE ITS DOES MENTION. NO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO RESTRICT ANYONE'S SPEECH. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO BE SAFE TO GET ACCESS TO VACCINES IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. AND NOT TO BE BULLIED OR TERMINATED- FROM GETTING A VACCINE THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO GET. A WITH THAT ARE STRICTLY ASPEN I WROTE.

JUSTICE LITTLE POINTED OUT THE CURRENT SCIENCE RECOGNIZES PTSD CAN TAKE TIME TO FULLY MANIFEST PARTICULARLY FOR VETERANS. RENDON NOTED THAT TREMENDOUS BACKLOGS AT THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS ARE OFTEN A BARRIER TO VETERANS AND ESTABLISHING THAT THEY HAVE A SERVICE CONFLATED CONDITION OR DISABILITY. ACCORDING TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RIVER EIGHTEEN REPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES. MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF INCARCERATED VETERANS WHO WERE HONORABLY DISCHARGED. MOREOVER INCARCERATED VETERANS WERE TWICE AS LIKELY AS NON VETERANS TO REPORT HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TELL THEM THEY HAD PTSD. MORE GENERALLY ABOUT HALF OF INCARCERATED VETS HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY HAVE A MENTAL DISORDER OR ILLNESS BY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AND OF THESE. THREE VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED OVER SB SEVEN SIXTY THREE IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO AB FIVE EIGHTY ONE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. A BILL THAT HAD BIPARTISAN BROAD SUPPORT IN LEGISLATURE AND WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE. THIS BILL SIMPLY ENSURES THAT THE STATE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THE ROLE THAT SERVICE RELATED MENTAL ILLNESS CAN PLAY IN FELONY OFFENSES COMMITTED BY MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS- THIS TRIES TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL PROCESS FOR THOSE WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY.

DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IT'LL SENATOR SKINNER. I'M YES- UNDER MEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE ASSERTION BY THE DA'S THAT THIS IS LIKE A DOUBLE DIP IN OTHER WORDS TWO BITES AT THE APPLE COULD YOU. THANK YOU SKINNER SKINNER- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT I RESPECT THE CDA IS CONCERNS HOWEVER I POINT OUT THE CURRENT LAW. ALREADY CONTEMPLATES THIS TYPE OF PROCESS FOR VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS WHO WERE CONVICTED OF A FELONY AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WITH THIS BILL WOULD DO IS SIMPLY HARMONIZED THAT BY ALLOWING THOSE CONVICTED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WITH THE SAME PROCESS SO- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT THIS IS. NOT THIS IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED THIS IS VERY MUCH PRESIDENT AND IS SIMPLY HARMONIZES THE LAW I'D ALSO POINT OUT THAT THERE. IS AS THE SCIENCE IS INCREASING SHOWING A OFTEN A LAG AND AN INABILITY FOR SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS SO IT'S OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO RAISE THIS ISSUE AT TRIAL- SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE BACKLOG WITH RECEIVING. MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS SO- I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR VETERANS I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND AGAIN WHILE I RESPECT THE DA'S CONCERNS. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THEM. BETTER SKINNER- TYPE THE CLEAR AND- PREHEAT YOUR EXPRESSION HOWEVER I THINK THAT IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE EXPERT WITNESSES I'M SORRY IF. NO TICKET THAT THEY BE ACCURATE IN THEIR TESTIMONY SO IF BY IN TERMS OF WHEN I READ THE ANALYSIS AND THEN YOUR- RESPONSE I WOULD- ASSERTED THE- DA'S ASSOCIATE STAFF WERE RATHER ENACT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY READ THE BILL- AGAIN FROM THE ANALYSIS AND- THIS IS WHAT THIS ALLOWS IS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE- SENTENCED. TO JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEENTH SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT. WHAT HOW THE DA'S ASSOCIATION COULD ASSERT THAT THIS IS TWO BITES AT THE APPLE- SO WITH THAT I MEAN I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT. WHAT WE'VE NOW LEARNED ABOUT TRAUMA AND A LITTLE TYPE OF TRAUMA THAT- MANY VETERANS EXPERIENCE. AND OTHERS IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GROW UP AND- WITNESS GUN VIOLENCE ON. MULTIPLE TIMES IT AS A YOUTH THAT TRAUMA IS VERY COMPARABLE TO THE TYPE OF TRAUMA THAT A VETERAN EXPERIENCES IN A COMBAT ZONE. SO I'VE GIVEN WHAT WE NOW THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THAT TRAUMA I THINK FACTORING IN THE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA ON PEOPLE'S SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOR ESPECIALLY IF THAT WAS IF THAT TRAUMA WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED OR TREATED IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF US PROCEEDING IN PUBLIC SAFETY SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL AND I WOULD. MOVE IT. THANK YOU SIR SKINNER DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE- SB SEVEN SIX THREE BY SENATOR SKINNER- SENATOR MAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR SKINNER- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR A OF A LARGE CLASS OF VETERANS AND SERVICEMEMBERS WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY HONORABLY.

WELCOME SENATOR FOR TINO I YOU PRESENT SB SEVENTY AT TIME- YOU WANT TO BE SEVENTY OR. THREE SEVEN. SORRY THREE SEVEN FIVE TWO ZERO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MADAM VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER SO I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK TO DEVELOP AN EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PREPARE NEW OFFICERS TO MEET- THE PROGRESSING EXPECTATIONS OF OUR COMMUNITIES FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS NARROW THE BILL TO JUST THE EDUCATION CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK FOR SOME HAPPY TO. TAKE THOSE-AMENDMENTS TO TRULY IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES AND RESTORE TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRETY OF AN OFFICE REGION REAR. AND TAKE A HOST TO ME AN ADOPT A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT INCLUDES PROVIDING THE BEST EDUCATION FOR THE PROFESSION. POLICE WORK IS ALWAYS BEEN A DANGEROUS JOB THAT THE CONDITIONS. ARE ALSO DANGEROUS FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT. AND SO EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE CRITICAL- THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO RETHINK OUR APPROACH OF EDUCATING OFFICERS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS. AND SKILLS FOR THE JOB TODAY TOMORROW AND INTO THE FUTURE. BUT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA'S OFFICERS ARE ALREADY AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO LEAD AND RAISE THE BAR IN TERMS OF OUR EDUCATIONAL STANDARD THIS IS WHY THE BILL PROPOSES TO CREATE A NEW COLLEGE CURRICULUM. TO SUPPLEMENT THE TRAINING OFFICERS RECEIVE AT THE ACADEMY. THE BILL REQUIRE POST CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING COMMISSION. WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN MAKE COLLEGE CSU AND THE UC. AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP A LIST OF COLLEGE COURSES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND CHALLENGES AND OFFICER FACES. THESE COURSES MAY BE TAKEN EITHER PRIOR DURING OR AFTER COMPLETION OF THE ACADEMY BUT MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN CONTAIN- COULD OBTAIN THEIR BASIC CERTIFICATE. THIS COURSE WORK WILL FOCUS ON THE MAIN SUCH A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY MENTAL HEALTH- AFRICAN AMERICAN RACIAL HISTORY- COMMUNICATIONS AND DEBATE SOCIAL. SOCIAL INEQUALITIES ETHICS CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY. AND MORE. THE FOCUS THAT YOU PATHWAYS TO. TRAINING USED INTERNATIONALLY AND POLICIES WE CAN BUILD UPON IN THE YEARS TO COME. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE WAY IN FORWARD THINKING POLICY SETTING A NATIONAL PRECEDENT. AND ATTRACTING ONLY THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES FRANKLY OUR COMMUNITIES DEMAND THAT WE DO THAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO ADVANCE OUR SHARED GOALS IN ELEVATING THE PROFESSION. ON THE PHONE TODAY I HAVE BRIAN- MARBLE THE PRESIDENT OF PORAC AND ERIC NUNEZ THE PRESIDENT OF THE C. PCA- AND WE ALSO HAVE- JONATHON FELDMAN ON THE LINE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IF ANY QUESTIONS ARISE. THANK YOU. WE GOTTA GO THE LEAD WITNESSES. OR. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'M SORRY. RELATED TO DO I GOT HERE DELETED. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE- SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TODAY SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THREE EIGHTY SEVEN A LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR EDUCATING CALIFORNIA'S NEXT GENERATION OF PEACE OFFICERS MY NAME IS BRIAN MARBLE AND I'M PRESIDENT OF THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA OR POOR IRAQ. IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE THE BEST TRAINED AND MOST HIGHLY EDUCATED PEACE OFFICERS IN THE COUNTRY BY THE END OF THIS DECADE. WE MUST DO MORE TO PROVIDE OUR OFFICERS WITH THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THEY NEED TO PREPARE FOR THE CHALLENGES OF MODERN DAY POLICING. THE BASIC DUTIES OF A PEACE OFFICER HAVE CHANGED IMMENSELY OVER THE YEARS. BUT THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION WE EXPECT OUR OFFICERS TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE ADVERSITIES THEY WILL FACE ON THE JOB TODAY. HAS CHANGED VERY LITTLE. TODAY LINE OFFICERS AND LEADERS MUST BE ABLE TO MEET A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES INCLUDING HOMELESSNESS. DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE HATE CRIMES AND A GROWING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. JEFFREY FAGAN A CRIMINOLOGIST AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MAY HAVE SAID IT BEST WE WANT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR EMOTIONAL REGULATION WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT PLANNING AND THINKING AHEAD. WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE A CAPACITY TO LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT BASIC POLICE ACADEMY SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH HOURS TO COVER EVERYTHING WE WANT OUR NEXT GENERATION PEACE OFFICERS TO KNOW. SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD CREATE A NEW CURRICULUM TO AUGMENT THE TRAINING OFFICERS RECEIVE AT THE ACADEMY. THIS CURRICULUM WOULD BE DEVELOPED IN PHASES OVER TIME IT WOULD INCLUDE ACADEMIC COURSE WORK ON MENTAL HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES PSYCHOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS AND MORE. THE GOAL IS TO EVENTUALLY CREATED AGREE SPECIFIC TO THE PRACTICE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY REQUIRES A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA TO QUALIFY FOR A CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT MUST REMAIN THAT WAY. THIS ALLOWS FOR A MUCH LARGER CANADA POOL. SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES INTERESTED IN A CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO FURTHER BOTH THEIR ACADEMIC AND CAREER GOALS WHILE PREPARING TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AS PEACE OFFICERS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR PROVIDING ME WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER POOR ACT PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN OTHER TOWARDS OUR GOALS OF HAVING THE BEST AND MOST HIGHLY EDUCATED POLICE FORCE IN THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

TRANSFORM POLICING IN THE YEARS AHEAD. ENGINE THE CHANGE IN OUTCOMES AT EVERY SINGLE ACTING THAT. LEAVING THE ACADEMY HAD A COMPLETE CALL COURSEWORK IN PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY PHILOSOPHY HISTORY ANATOMY AND YOU NAME IT. HOW BETTER EQUIPPED TO OUR OFFICERS BE IT BEFORE THE WHERE THE BATCH THEY'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A CURRICULUM THAT INCLUDES INTERNSHIPS IN FIELDS RELATED TO BUT OUTSIDE OF POLICING AND A MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC OR SOCIAL SERVICE CENTER. CRITICAL THINKING AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE ARE KEY TRAITSWE NEED DEVELOP IN OUR OFFICERS. EDUCATE THE EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY CREATED BY S. SPEECH REDUCE. WHICH WILL BE.

YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR OPENING ABOUT THE RISK THAT ARE SWORN OFFICERS TAKE EVERY DAY THEY WALK OUT THE DOOR IN THEIR UNIFORMS OR IS IT IS- IS ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE. AND D. I THINK THE- AUSSIE TRAUMA IT'S A VERY COMMON WORD IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT I THINK THE TRAUMA THAT. WE AND I SAY A COLLECTIVE WEEK OUR- COMMUNITIES WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MORE POLICE VIOLENCE BUT ALSO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WHO THEMSELVES ARE. IT WHO IN VARIOUS ENCOUNTERS WHETHER IT'S- CIRCUMSTANCES IN AS A. FIVE WHETHER TO TRAFFIC STOP FOR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHERE WHERE AN ARMED PERSON CAN ALSO DO HARM TO THE OFFICERS THAT THIS. THAT THESE. THIS VERY- IT'S ALMOST I I'M NOT SURE WHAT WORD TO USE BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE INTENSE AND THEY OFTEN THEY CAN LEAD TO. NOT GOOD DECISIONS AND I THINK THE S. B. PRESIDENT PORAC MENTION OR MAYBE IT WAS ANOTHER WITNESS. BETTER TRAINING AND MORE EDUCATION WELL IT WOULD NOT ELIMINATE. MUCH AS SOME OF THE REACTIONS THAT OCCUR. IT COULD GREATLY IMPROVE THEM. AND WE I THINK WE HAVE AIRED IN THAT. GIVEN THAT WE PUT THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY JOBS THAT IN PUBLIC SERVICE WERE BASICALLY WE ALLOW. BY BEING ARMED IN FACT. AND I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THIS LIGHTLY WE ALLOW SWORN OFFICERS TO TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE. THAT TO HAVE THE KIND OF MINIMAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING THAT WE HAVE THUS FAR AND THIS AND I DON'T WANT TO SWORN OFFICERS TO THINK THAT I FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO TRAINING NO BUT THE- BUT GIVEN THE GRAVITY. OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVE THAT TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND I THINK THAT'S- THE PURPOSE OF YOUR BILL AND WE ALSO. AND I THINK THE INTENTION WHICH IS NOW BEEN SOMEWHAT MODIFIED. AROUND TURNER ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT. BUT THE VERY ATTRACTION TO THE POSITION. MAY IN BY THESE CHANGES. IT MAY AND IT MAY CHANGE TO THAT IS ATTRACTED TO THE POSITION ALSO SO WE COULD BE- ASSISTING THAT OTHER GOAL JUST BY. THE CHANGE IN OUR TRAINING AND EDUCATION THAT YOUR BILL. IS RECOMMENDING SO I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND- I WILL MOVE IT. UNLESS IT'S ALREADY BEEN MOVED I'M HAPPY TO MOVE IT. I DON'T KNOW IF THE SENATOR- TO ABOVE DID- AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR. THANK YOU CENTER CONNOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM TO AM VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT YOU ACCEPTED- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. YOU KNOW I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON GOING AND CAN CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS- AROUND SORT OF FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT PUBLIC SAFETY. IS ABOUT- AND FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND I THINK IT IS- IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO KIND OF PLACE THOSE- REALLY- CIRCUMSPECT OF DISCUSSIONS TO WAIT THIS BILL DOWN WITH- WITH THOSE VERY HEAVY- IN DEEP YOU KNOW ISSUES- NO BILL IS ABOUT YOU KNOW. ENCOMPASSES THE TOTALITY OF ISSUE THAT WE'RE FACING. I SAY THAT IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE SHARED IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I AM. I AM GLAD THAT THE- RECRUITMENT ASPECT OF THE BILL AS IT RELATES TO GOING INTO THE SCHOOLS WAS MODIFIED- THEN I WON'T GET INTO THAT. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE- TO THE LEFT OF ME- SHARED. YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THE REALITY IS THAT WE GIVE UNFETTERED AUTHORITY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- INTO POLICE OFFICERS FOLKS GET A BADGE THEY GET A GUN WE SEND THEM OUT INTO THE WORLD. AND WE ASK THEM TO BE SUPERMAN AND SUPER WOMEN- AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DIAL THAT BACK. AND OFFER MORE OF A LOT OF THINGS- TO HELP THEM STAY SAFE. TO HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH- AND TO ALSO HELP THEM MANAGE THE KINDS OF DECISIONS THAT WE ARE ASKING THEM TO MAKE SECOND BY SECOND MINUTE BY MINUTE. WHILE THEY'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO THEY ARE SERVING ARE ALSO PROTECTED AND ARE SAFE- I HOPE THAT THERE CAN BE DEEPER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE KINDS OF TRAINING THAT OUR OFFICERS NEED- THE KINDS OF EDUCATION THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE. AND WHAT THE DECISIONS THAT THEY ARE BEING ASKED TO MAKE HOW THOSE DECISIONS IMPACT NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE INDIVIDUAL'S THAT THEY MAY BE CONFRONTING. BUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALSO IMPACTED EVERY SINGLE DAY BY THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE. AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO EMPOWER FOLKS WITH EDUCATION AND INFORMATION. TO NOT JUST GO TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR WHEN IT COMES TO CRISIS RESOLUTION AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BEING CONFRONTED WITH NOW IN CURRENT TIMES- AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY SO. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT AND- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE- WITH THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WARNER I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I TOO WILL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THAT AMENDMENTS AS I THINK OUR EXPRESS PREVIOUSLY. THE HEART OF THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND I REALLY THINK IT'S GREAT TO FOCUS THE BILL ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I THINK THIS BILL TAKES AN INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO THOSE AND A FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO THOSE EDUCATION. REQUIREMENTS SO I THINK IT'S A POSITIVE THING I HAVE FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS AS A- NEIGHBORHOOD LEADER BEFORE I WAS IN PUBLIC OFFICE AS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL- AND MY JOB IS ATTORNEY INTERACTED WITH A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS OVER THE YEARS. AND THERE'S A HUGE SPECTRUM OF OFFICES IN TERMS OF PERSONALITY TYPES- BUT ALSO JUST SKILL SETS AND INTERACTING WITH THE PUBLIC IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT LEAD. TO USE OF FORCE AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE VERY SKILLED WHO NEVER FIRE THEIR- GUN THEIR ENTIRE CAREER THERE I THINK IT'S A VAST MAJORITY AND I THINK SOMETHING LIKE A MAJORITY OF OFFICERS NEVER EVEN DRAW. THEIR PISTOL IN THEIR ENTIRE CAREER- AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF OFFICERS WHO I THINK ARE YOU KNOW. OUR OUR HAVE THOSE SKILLS BUT WE NEED TO BE ALL OFFICERS WANT TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT- AND I THINK THIS BILL WILL THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET BUT THIS BILL WILL HELP MOVE US IN THAT DIRECTION- AND SO I'M HAPPY TO MOVE. THE BILL THERE HASN'T BEEN A MOTION ALREADY. THANK YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK OF MY CALL. FOR MAKING THEIR COMMENTS ON THIS MEASURE AND I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. WORKING NOT ONLY WITH THIS COMMITTEE WILL WITH ME TO MOVE FORWARD AND BRINGING FORTH THE MEASURE THAT WE CAN ALL SUPPORT. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE NO ARGUMENT THAT A BETTER TRAINED OFFICER IS A- MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAFER. BUT I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO AGREE THAT TRAINING IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH. WE'VE SEEN TOO FAR TOO MANY INCIDENTS WHERE THEY GET IT RIGHT IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT THEY DON'T GET A RIDE IN BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS IT SEEMS LIKE THEY KNOW WHEN THE DRAW THEIR WEAPON. IN A FLUID NEIGHBORHOODS AND- THE SAME THING THAT. CONFRONTS THEM IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD MAKE SOME FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES AND- IT GOES TO RECRUITMENT AS WELL. AND THAT WAS FBI STUDY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THE STATE IT. THE LARGEST RECRUITMENT OF WHITE SUPREMACIST. INDIVIDUALS ARE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW THAT SHOULD BE TROUBLING TO ALL OF US WHETHER YOU'RE A MINORITY WHETHER YOU'RE WHITE THIS SHOULD BE A CONCERN TO ALL OF US SO RECRUITMENT IS. TRUE TRULY A MAJOR PART OF THIS. AND CHANGING THE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN CHANGE SOMEONE'S HEART. BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS PREJUDICE. THERE IS HATRED AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THE TRAINING WORLD IT'S GONNA. REMOVE THAT BECAUSE FOR SOME FOLKS IT'S A GREAT FEAR OF ANYONE WITH MELANIN IN THEIR SKIN TONE. AND I WILL ONLY USE EXAMPLE OF JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN A WHITE INDIVIDUAL WENT INTO A POLICE DEPARTMENT. JUST NORTH OF HERE. CLEARLY STATED HE WANTED TO KILL OFFICERS. CLEARLY STATED HE WAS THERE TO KILL OFFICERS EVEN TOOK AN OFFICER'S BRIAN HEAD CAME IN WITH A GUN FOR SELF I SHOULD SAY AND THAT INDIVIDUAL SOMEHOW MADE IT OUT ALIVE WAS ABLE TO POST BAIL AND- WAS ABLE TO. SPEND TIME WITH HIS FAMILY MEMBERS. WHERE IS IN THIS STATE AND IN IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU'RE BLACK AND YOU'RE BROWN AND YOU'RE RUNNING FROM POLICE OFFICERS YOU FIND YOURSELF MORE OFTEN THAN NOT SHOT AND KILLED. AND EVADING ARREST SHOULD NOT BE A DEATH SENTENCE RUNNING FROM A POLICE OFFICER SHOULD NOT BE A DEATH SENTENCE AND THAT'S THE TROUBLING PART WITH ME'S AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING SO I THINK- AGAIN AUTHORED FOR UNDERSTANDING THAT AND HAS EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN. HAVING NOT ONLY A BETTER TRAINING OFFICER BUT A BETTER DIVERSE POLICE DEPARTMENT THE REFLECTS ALL COMMUNITIES ALL GENDERS. THAT TRULY HAS O BE A PART OF THIS. EQUATION A MORE COMPASSIONATE OFFICER. AND A GREATER REVERENCE FOR LIFE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU TRAIN AT BUT I BELIEVE YOU CAN RECRUIT THAT. SOUL I KNOW IT'S NOT ALL WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO PUT IT TO A GREAT START TO FIXING A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS AND WE HAVE TO DO BETTER- WE DO HAVE TO REIMAGINE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK THIS BILL HELPS US DO THAT SO ON THAT NOTE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER I WOULD FORGET THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SIGN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. I THINK YOUR. COMMENT WE HAVE TO DO BETTER IS REALLY. IS REALLY THE DIRECTION WE ALL HAVE TO TAKE- WE JUST HAVE TO DO BETTER AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL TAKES A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS- THE PROGRAMS AND ISSUES RAISED HER. FROM THE OPPOSITION. NO ONE TAKES LIGHTLY- CERTAINLY WE NEED TO FIND- MANY OF THE EFFORTS THAT ARE ONGOING. AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR TO LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND NOW WILL MOVE ON TO YOUR SECOND ITEM. S. B. SEVEN ONE FIVE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- SENDING SB SEVEN FIFTEEN WHICH REQUIRED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT. OF A- PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE HAS A LICENSE TO HAS HUNTING LICENSE IN ORDER TO PURCHASE A FIREARM FIREARMS. UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN TRANSFERRING OR PURCHASING A FIREARM WITHIN HOT. WITH A HUNTING LICENSE THERE'S NO VERIFICATION PROCESS DURING THE TEN DAY BACKGROUND CHECK. TO ENSURE THAT THE LICENSE IS VALID IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN NINETEEN YEAR OLD ILLEGALLY PURCHASED THE SEMI ARCTIC CENTERFIRE RIFLE FROM A DEALER. WITH AN INVALID HUNTING LICENSE AND TRAGICALLY OPENED FIRE AT A SYNAGOGUE IN POWAY. BECAUSE THE GUN STORE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY CHECK THE VALIDITY OF THE LICENSE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CLEAR THE BACKGROUND CHECKS. THAT HORRIFIC TRAGEDY OCCURRED THIS BALL ALSO DEALS WITH AN UNRESOLVED ISSUE IN A PREVIOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. SPECIFICALLY THIS CLARIFIES THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN INVESTIGATE AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED CIVILIAN. OR IF THERE IS A REASONABLE DISPUTE THAT THIS IS A CIVILIAN WAS ON ARM THIS IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO ME. BECAUSE- IN PASADENA. LAST YEAR THERE IS A DISPUTE ABOUT SOMEONE WHO WAS TRAGICALLY SHOT OF WHETHER THAT PERSON HAD A GUN. OR DIDN'T HAVE A GUN AND THAT CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER THE PRIOR LAW WOULD NOT ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES WERE TRYING TO CLEAR OUT IF IT IF IT'S DISPUTED THE AG SHOULD BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE. LASTLY THE BILL CONTAINS CODE CLEANUP AND REFERENCES. ULTIMATELY SB SEVEN FIFTEEN WILL ADDRESS OUTSTANDING CIRCUMSTANCES I'M COVERED IN THE POWAY SHOOTING ENSURE THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE DONE COMPREHENSIVELY SO THAT THE SAME MISTAKES DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. AND OBVIOUSLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I KNOW- YOU ALL BEEN WANTING IRWIN- NETWORK TO MAKE HIS RETURN TO THE COMMITTEE. HE IS HERE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS SO WE ALSO BROUGHT BACK A WIN FOR YOU ALL. I THOUGHT. NO I DON'T HAVE A CARD- HA HA HA HA.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- INITIALING ITS LANDMARK NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX DECISION IN BATSON VERSUS KENTUCKY THE SUPREME COURT SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE RACIAL BIAS IN JURY SELECTION BY PROVIDING PARTIES THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO OPPOSING PARTIES PRINT THREE CHALLENGES. BUT IS A JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL WROTE IN HIS PROPHETIC CURRENT CURRENT OPINION. CIDCO THIS TODAY WILL NOT END THE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION THAT RAMP DREES INJECT INTO THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS THAT GOAL CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED ONLY BY ELIMINATING PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ENTIRELY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE HAS ACCUMULATED IN THE INTERVENING YEARS TO PROVE THAT THE LATE JUSTICE MARSHALL WAS CORRECT STUDY AFTER STUDY. SHOWS THE PRINTER JONES ARE USED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR PATTERSON NOT WITHSTANDING AS MANY BIG KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SOME COURTS EFFORTS IN THOSE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN ITS OWN PREQUEL BATS IN THE WHEELER DECISION TO ELIMINATE JURY BIAS. HAVE FAILED AMERICANS FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS FADING FAST ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITH HALF MEASURES WILL NOT DO THAT'S WHY INTRODUCED SENATE BILL TWO TWELVE. WE TAKEN STEPS TO HIGHLIGHT THIS ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE IN MY VIEW NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH- IN A MOMENT. CHIEF JUSTICE STEPHEN C. GONZALEZ AWASH IN SPRING COURT WILL DISCUSS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. IN HIS CALL TO ABOLISH PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IN A TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN CONCURRING OPINION THAT LED WASHINGTON CHANGED ITS OWN PRINTER RULES BOB. HE SAYS THAT THERE ARE NO ACCURATE RELIABLE WAY TO IDENTIFY HOW IN WHICH PRINT THE CHALLENGES ARE BIASED ON RACE AND WHICH ARE NOT CHIEF JUSTICE CONSOLS EXHAUSTIVELY RESEARCHED CONCURRENCE- IN THAT OPINION I SAID A MOMENT AGO INCLUDE A QUOTE FROM PROSECUTORS SAID THAT ANY ATTORNEY WORTH HIS. I SUPPOSE OR HER SALT CAN MAKE UP SOMETHING TO GET OVER A BATSON CHALLENGE AND LITERALLY PROSECUTORS TO MAKE IT UP JUSTICE BRYER STEVEN BRIAR. KNOWN AS CONCURRING OPINION IN MILLER L. VERSUS JACKIE CASEY SAID REINFORCED JUSTICE MARSHALL'S CONCERNS ABOUT PRINTING CHALLENGES THE USE OF RACE AND GENDER BASED STEREOTYPES THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS SEEMS BETTER ORGANIZED AND MORE SYSTEM. SYSTEMATIZE THAN EVER BEFORE. HELLO A TWENTY TWO. IS A BONTA. ISN'T UNPOPULAR POSITION I RECOGNIZE WITH MANY. LAWYERS WHO TRY CASES THEY ALL BELIEVE IN JURY SELECTION THAT THEY ARE EXPERT IN FIGURING OUT. BASED ON THEIR BIASES BASED ON THEIR PREJUDICES WHO SHOULD NOT BE ON THE JURY. HOWEVER WHEN JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID A STUDY USING MOCK TRIALS IT DEMONSTRATED THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. DEFENSE LAWYERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN MOCK TRIAL BOB WOULD HAVE DONE JUST AS WELL HERE THEY- NOT EXERCISE THEIR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ARE BASED ON A FLIP OF A COIN EXERCISE THEIR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. I WAS A AND I SUPPOSE I STILL AM A TRIAL LAWYER AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE BASIS IS THE BASIS IS TO LOOK AT JURORS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN SKEW THE JURY TO YOUR SIDE. BASED ON BIAS AND PREJUDICE THAT IS NO PLACE IN OUR SYSTEM. THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR A FAIR TRIAL WITH AN IMPARTIAL JURY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT. ENGLAND INVENTED PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES AND EIGHT NOW ELIMINATED THE METABOLIC. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO. MISTER CHAIR IS I'D LIKE TO TURN TO- ON. OUR WITNESS. LIST CHIEF JUSTICE STEPHEN GONZALEZ WHO WILL DISCUSS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY POSE TO OUR SYSTEM. A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JUSTICE. MISTER CHIEF JUSTICE FOR YOURS YOUR APARTMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CHANCE TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT. MIKE MY COLLEAGUES JUST AS WHERE YOU AND I ROACH INFO IN FAVOR OF SB THIRTY SEVENTY. WHEN IT WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION AND I STILL BELIEVE IT WAS. A STEP FORWARD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. EVIDENCE MATTERS IN FACT. BETTER RESEARCHERS YOU HEARD SHOWS THE PRINTER CHALLENGES ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY USED BY ANYONE ESSENTIALLY IN ARE THE CAUSE OF STRUCTURAL BIAS. AGAINST POTENTIAL JURORS OF COLOR. AND OTHER BIASES AS WELL NOT JUST LIMITED TO THAT DEMOGRAPHIC. AN ATTORNEY PATERNITY DESPITE THE EVIDENCE UNIFORMLY BELIEVE THAT THEY USE THEM WELL EVEN IF EVERYONE ELSE DOESN'T. ELIMINATION OF BIAS IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN MY VIEW MUST BE DONE. SYSTEMATICALLY AND SYSTEMICALLY. WHAT I MEAN IS THAT BOTH SB THIRTY SEVENTY AND S. B. TWENTY TWELVE. ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS ONE FORM OR ONE SOURCE ON THE MANIFESTATION OF THIS BIAS SYSTEMATICALLY THAT IS. I'M PRETTY CHALLENGES AND HOW THEY ARE USED BY COUNSEL IN CASES. BUT I WROTE IN THAT OPINION YOU HEARD REFERENCE. EIGHT YEARS AGO THAT WE SHOULD ABOLISH PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ALTOGETHER AND I STILL BELIEVE. THAT THAT IS THE BETTER COURSE. ON THE SCIENCE AND EVIDENCE SUPPORTS IT BUT THE ELIMINATION OF. BRENT CRUDE CHALLENGES IS NOT A PANACEA FOR ALL MANIFESTATIONS OF BIAS IN OUR SYSTEM. IN WASHINGTON STATE WE DID NOT ELIMINATE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES I RECOMMEND IT. BUT WE ADOPTED OUR GENERAL RULE THIRTY SEVEN WHICH WAS A MODEL FOR A BI THIRTY SEVENTY BUT I BELIEVE IT TO BE A COMPROMISE THAT MOVES US SUBSTANTIALLY. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ONE EMPHASIZE THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SYSTEMATICALLY REDUCE BIAS. ELIMINATION MUST ALSO BE SYSTEMIC. DISTINGUISH SYSTEMATIC FROM SYSTEMIC. IN THIS WAY. SYSTEMATIC IS GETTING A RULE THAT ADDRESSES HOW IT MANIFESTS IN THE EXERCISE OF PEREMPTORIES. BUT IS INSUFFICIENT ONLY TO DO THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU ELIMINATE BIAS IN ONE PLACE REEMERGES SOMEWHERE ELSE IT HAS TO BE DONE. SYSTEMICALLY AS WELL ALL PHASES OF JURY SELECTION AND INDEED THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED AND REEVALUATED BUT ELIMINATION OF BIAS THAT REASSESSMENT OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES IN MIND- SELECTION AT IMPROVE THE SOURCE LIST. SELECT THE SELECTION PROCESS NEEDS TO ELIMINATE MANY QUESTIONS BY COUNSEL AND BY JUDGES WHO ATTEMPT TO REHABILITATE JURORS WITH LEADING QUESTIONS. THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSED DOUBT ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. IT MEANS ALLOWING COUNCIL THE TIME TO EXPLORE ACTUAL BIAS REMAINS A PLAYING THE RACIAL BIAS LANDS THE HARDSHIP QUESTIONS BECAUSE QUESTIONS AS WELL. IT MEANS GETTING PROSPECTIVE JURORS TALKING. NOT HAVING COUNCIL ATTEMPTING TO ARGUE THEIR CASE. DURING JURY SELECTION. HELP BATTLE MEMBERS OF A POTENTIAL JURY DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO CERTAIN. BUT THEY DO HAVE A RIGHT NOT TO BE REMOVED FOR IMPROPER REASONS. I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE THIRTY SEVEN IN OUR STATE AND AGED THIRTY SEVENTY WORK IF THEY WORK THEN PERHAPS MORE YEARS WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR PRECIOUS BUT SCIENTIFICALLY INEFFECTIVE. THE CHALLENGES FURTHER I SEE NO REASON TO CREATE CIVIL CASES DIFFERENTLY FROM CRIMINAL CASES AND IN MY ATTEMPTS TO BE. INTELLECTUALLY HONEST HERE. IT'S LIKELY A POLITICAL COMPROMISE TO DO JUST CRIMINAL AND NOT CIVIL. SHOULD THE LITIGATORS ARE NOT FREE FROM THE SAME BIAS THE CRIMINAL LITIGATORS HAVE BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE SUFFER FROM THIS ISSUE. I WOULD ELIMINATE THEM ALTOGETHER AND I WOULD REFORM THE JURY SYSTEM PROCESS ENTIRELY TO ROOT OUT ADDITIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF BIAS SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST MOVED FROM ONE PORTION AND ALLOWED TO. CONTINUE TO EXIST OTHERS THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE FOR ME TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT PROCRIT CHALLENGES AND THE NEED FOR US TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT EVERY STAGE OF OUR JURY SELECTION PROCESS BUT WELL AS OUR PROCESS AS A WHOLE. IT IS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU CHIEF JUSTICE NOW WILL MOVE TO. WITNESSES AND SIDE OF FORTY TWO OLD THREE AND SO FORTH OF FEE TO TWELVE FIFTEEN NINE WILL MATURE OVER FLOOR ROOM ON TWENTY FORTY I SHOULD KNOW WITNESSES THERE EITHER NOW WILL GO TO OUR PHONE LINE MODERATORS ARE THERE WITNESSES WANTING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF S.

I HAVE SPENT MANY OF MY FORTY PLUS YEARS AS A CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER OPPOSING DISCRIMINATORY JURY SELECTION PRACTICES. A HIGH POINT IN THOSE AFTER LAST. BUT SEVERAL OF MY STUDENTS AND I PUBLISHED WHITEWASHING THE JURY BOX WHICH WE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY SEVENTY. GRAND ASSEMBLYMEMBER DR SHIRLEY WEBER LANDMARK CIVIL RIGHTS. LEGISLATION EVIDENCE BASED FOUNDATION FOR AB THIRTY SEVENTY WHAT'S SALAS. I REPORT TO THE WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT RECOMMENDED G. R. THIRTY SEVEN ON WHICH WE MODELED AB THIRTY SEVENTY. OUR REPORT EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL TRIAL. DEMONSTRATED HOW PROSECUTORS USED THEIR STRIKE. DISPROPORTIONATELY REMOVE BLACK JURORS AND HOW ABOUT THE WHEELER PROCEDURE IN PLACE FOR DECADES HAD FAILED TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION. THE WASHINGTON REPORT AND HOURS AS JUSTICE GONZALEZ MENTIONED REJECTED ENDING PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. THROUGHOUT THE SESSION LAST YEAR WE WORKED TO REACH AGREEMENTS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CRIMINALIZED BY THREE COMMITTEE. AB THIRTY SEVENTY LANGUAGE DEEPLY TROUBLING TO ME THAT SENATOR- BURKE WOULD INVOKE JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL IN HIS EFFORT TO REPEAL THE. HISTORIC LEGISLATION. AND JUSTICE MARCH LEVEL COURT. AFTER SUPREME PROCEDURE. MORE REDUCE PROSECUTORS DISCRIMINATORY RIGHT.

YOUR BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET RESERVE PROFILING OR BECAUSE THAT YOUR NEW PEOPLE THAT WERE ARRESTED. OR FOUND THAT THEY WERE ARRESTED. WE HAVE BEEN AMONG. FROM JURIES FOR THE SENATE WITH BLACK IN AMERICA. AB THIRTY SEVENTY MAKES DOES WILLIAMS PRESUMPTIVELY INVALID. IT REMOVES MUCH OF THE RACISM AND BIAS EXISTED AND QUICKLY CHALLENGES. AND INSTEAD OF STAYING WE CAN ABIDE BY THOSE RULES WHO CAN AFFORD BEING BIASED WE CAN AVOID BASED ON YOUR SELECTION THEY WOULD RATHER ELIMINATE QUICKLY CHALLENGES ALL TO GET. AND BY DOING SO.

TO TWELVE. SENATOR SKINNER. M. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT- AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE TESTIMONY FROM OUR CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUDGES IT- VERY STRONGLY HELD OPINIONS. AND ALSO EVIDENCED BY THE OTHER TESTIMONY WE HEARD WE- DID HAVE DEBATED BILLS BY- SENATOR JACKSON BY- BYE THESE ARE PREVIOUS BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHIRLEY WEBER AND OTHERS ON THIS QUESTION- AND THEY WERE PILOT PROGRAMS AND SUCH. BUT WE THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW THE BILL BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IT THIS BILL WOULD IN EFFECT ON DUKEREPORT PORTIONS OF IT. AND I FEEL THAT. IT WAS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR US TO DO SO AT THIS TIME. AND THAT WHILE IT IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT AND TO. STE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT HAS THE IT WHETHER IT EASIER PROCEEDS AS THE AUTHOR INTENDED WITH THAT MOTIVATION OR WHETHER IT CREATES THE TYPE OF CONSEQUENCE THAT WOULD APPEAR THE- ISSUE YOU IN THE PROPONENTS OF YOUR BILL FEEL IT MAY- BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT GIVEN THAT IT WAS JUST ENACTED IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO UNDO IT. AND IF YOU WANT TO COME INTO A YOU MAY. SERVICE CHAIR. WOULD LIKE TO COME IN OUR MY CLOTHES FONG HOW DO YOU PLEASE OF WELL. S. ANNOUNCES TO SENATOR SKINNER IS COMMON I DON'T DO THIS IS UNDOING THIRTY SEVENTY WHAT I WHAT I DO THIS IS TAKING IT A STEP FURTHER- SO LONG HELD BELIEF THAT. WE HAVE A SYSTEM A PROCESS THAT IS FLAWED IS A PROCESS THAT IS BASED ON SIMPLY RAW PREJUDICE THAT'S WHAT IT'S BASED UPON. EACH SIDE EACH SIDE IS TRYING TO SKEW THE JURY TO AN OUTCOME THAT THEY BELIEVE IT IS IN THEIR FAVOR I WAS PLACES CIVIL CASES AS WELL NOT JUST CRIMINAL CASE USUAL NOTE THERE WERE NO DJS THEY WERE THAT. WAS A DID NOT TESTIFY DEREK BECAUSE THEY ALSO BOTH SIDES ONE SKEW THE JERK. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS NOW. WHAT DOES IT I DO BELIEVE AS IS CHIEF JUSTICE GONZALEZ ILLUSTRATED THE NEED TO BE FURTHER REFORM IN TERMS OF ENLARGING THE VENEER. VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT. CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE A GRANTED LIBERALLY. VERY IMPORTANT MAKING SURE THAT IF A CHILD FOR CAUSES NOT GRANTED AND THERE IS A REASON THAT YOU CAN OBJECT AND YOU CAN BRING THAT FORWARD. GOOD IDEA BUT SIMPLY HAVING A SYSTEM WERE TINKERING WITH. WE'RE TINKERING WITH PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTALLY BASED ON BIAS AND PREJUDICE. I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP FURTHER. THE TWO CLOSEST CONCERTS IN A WINNER. THANK YOU I'M TRYING TO DEVELOP. THIS IS MADE BY THE AUTHOR. SIR AT THE END OF A SESSION SORRY FOR MY VOICE AGAIN DECISION LAST YEAR THE AUTHOR AND I HAD- SEVERAL LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR- OUR DIFFERING VIEWS ON AB- THIRTY SEVENTY ONE UP. WHEN I WAS. WHEN THAT WAS ON THE FLOOR- AND I OF COURSE I WAS THE BY WAS THE FLOOR MANAGER OF AB THIRTY SEVEN DAY I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL- AND I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO PASS IT. ON I AS I EXPRESS THE AUTO TIME I OF- MY I'M NOT LIKE THE BIGGEST CHAMPION OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IS A FORMER CIVIL TRIAL. ATTORNEY AND I'VE SEEN THE PROS AND THE CONS AND THERE ARE PROS AND CONS TO PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S IT THAT THERE ARE. ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM AND I'M NOT HERE TO SORT OF- CLASS GLANCE OVER THAT BUT WITH THAT SAID I ALSO DO BELIEVE THAT IT BE THIRTY SEVENTY- WAS WAS A LANDMARK LAW. I THINK IT'S A GOOD LAW DO- IN MY VIEW I'D JUST LIKE TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE IMPLEMENTED- AND THEN ON THIS BROADER ISSUE PEREMPTORIES WE CAN ALL WE CAN REVISIT IT YOU KNOW IF AB THIRTY SEVENTY FOR WHATEVER REASON ISN'T WORKING I THINK IT LIKELY WILL WORK- AS WE'VE HEARD FROM WASHINGTON STATE BY- I DO WANNA GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. CONTINUING TO RAISE THIS ISSUE- BUT I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. NO COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SENATOR ULTRABOOK. INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE- THE TURNING RIGHT HERE PRESENTING THE BILL AND WE HAVE AN ATTORNEY HERE IN THE COMMITTEE AND IT'S INTERESTING HOW- WE COME UP WITH DIFFERING VIEWS AND ANGLES IN IN IN POLICY- HAVING SAID THAT I DO APPRECIATE. THE EFFORT OF OR THE STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE THAT YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO- BASICALLY NULLIFIER OR OUT DO THE AB THIRTY SEVENTY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE THAT- AND JUST MOVE IT A STEP FURTHER. FASHION AND I IT WAS INTERESTING ALSO TO NOTE THE COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF CHIEF JUSTICE STEPHEN GONZALEZ- AND THEN. ALSO. PROFESSORS AT SIMONE SIMONE ON AND GET SOME MORE AND- AND THE DEFENDER- WOODS- ON THIS ISSUE- OBVIOUSLY IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED AND BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN THIS IN THIS BILL AND- WITH THAT INTENT OF TRYING TO IMPROVE- A CURRENT SYSTEM NOT OUT DOING AB THIRTY SEVENTY I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO MOVE. THIS THIS THIS BILL FORWARD- IN ORDER FOR IT TO HOPEFULLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE ITS WORK- AND I THINK ULTIMATELY I THINK EVERYBODY HAS- THE INTENT OF IMPROVING A SYSTEM THAT IS FLAWED- AND WITH THAT I RESPECT YOUR INTENT- AS THE AUTHOR- ADDITION COMMENTER. QUESTIONS UPON THIS ROCK. I TWO ONE EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR I BELIEVE YOUR INTENTIONS ARE GENUINE. BUT STATED BY MY OTHER COLLEAGUES I THINK THIS MEASURE IS PREMATURE OR UNDERSTANDING THAT- AB THIRTY SEVENTY DOES NOT EVEN GO INTO EFFECT TILL JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR AND I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE IT STAND THE SUN TO PROVE. THAT IT WORKS OR IT CAN IMPROVE UPON A SYSTEM IN A PROCESSOR WE ALL AGREE IS FLAWED IT'S ALL WE ALL AGREE IS BIAS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S MONUMENTAL LEGISLATION THAT WE VOTED FOR LAST YEAR AND IT SHOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITIES- PROVE ITSELF WORTHY. BEFORE CHANGING IT AS A WHOLE SO THERE ANALYZE MY CONCERN HERE- NOT WITH THE. INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND HIS. GENUINE COMMITMENT TRY TO OUR STARTS- WE WOULD ALL AGREE AS A STATED IS FLAWED BUT- IT'S ONE THAT I THINK IT'S TIME IS HASN'T COME YET. AND FOR THOSE REASONS TO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE BUT- I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT AND IF YOU'D LIKE YOU CAN CLOSE AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU MISTER I'LL BE BRIEF- I THINK THIS IS A CONTINUING CONVERSATION I THINK THERE'S A CONVERSATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE FOR SOMETIME TO COME. BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF US WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHETHER IT'S A CIVIL TRIAL OR CRIMINAL TRIAL THAT THERE IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE JUSTICE AND THOSE WHO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. ARE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JURY YOU'VE HEARD WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY ABOUT HOW PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IMPACT A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JURY AND I WORRY I WORRY I'VE HEARD ONE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT YOU KNOW WE HAD A TRAVESTY. IN SOUTHERN WITHIN OUR MEMORY AND I WAS THE RODNEY KING TRIAL THAT WAS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF HOW PEREMPTORIES CAN BE USED FOR IN MY VIEW ON THE FERRY IS PURPOSE. AND SO I'LL CONTINUE THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS- WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT THIS. FOR SOME TIME AND WITH THAT I. WOULD ASK FOR AND I WILL. GREET ALL RIGHT WE HAVE THE MOST ON S. B. TWO TWELVE- A TO DO PASSAGE TO APPROPRIATIONS.
