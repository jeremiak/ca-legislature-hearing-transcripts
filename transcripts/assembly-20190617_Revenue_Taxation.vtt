00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:31.182
EXCHANGE AND WE ARE NOT GOING

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:32.750
BACK TO REPLACE IT.

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:33.785
AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:35.586
WITH FULL EXPENSING THEY DID

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:37.322
THAT AND CREATE A PROCESS AT

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:38.923
LEAST AT THE END THE DAY WHICH

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.291
EVERYTHING REALLY KIND OF ZEROED

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:41.926
OUT AND SO THERE WAS NO ECONOMIC

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:44.529
CAT -- THIS REALLY BOILS DOWN TO

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:47.065
UNFORTUNATELY -- A CAR TAX ON

00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:49.300
LEASING OF VEHICLES -- LIGHT CAN

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:50.668
EXCHANGE HAS BEEN A VERY VERY

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.370
HELPFUL TOOL TO BRING LEASED

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.205
VEHICLES INTO THE MARKET -- AT A

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:56.941
LOWER MORE COST EFFECTIVE PRICE --

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.676
OVER THE LAST MONTH WE HAVE

00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:02.046
BROUGHT NUMEROUS OPTIONS FORWARD --

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:04.716
I SIX OPTIONS VARIED IN DEGREE

00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:06.250
ALL IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.086
MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.821
A LIMITING LIKE KIND EXCHANGE

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:11.656
NOT REPLACING IT WITH ANYTHING --

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:12.957
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH WE'RE STILL

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.592
IN A POSITION WHERE REALLY A

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.761
HANDFUL OF MEMBERS MANY WHO DO A

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.062

PROVIDE A LOT OF ECONOMIC GOOD

00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:20.965
FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:23.701
ARE GOING TO BE HIT WITH 56% OF

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:27.605
THE TOTAL -- THAT THE TOTAL BILL

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:28.406
FOR THE LIKE KIND EXCHANGE

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:30.808
PORTION THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:31.442
FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.344
DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS.

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:36.147
THAT IS A VERY LARGE SUM TO TO

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:38.082
PUT ON A ONE INDUSTRY -- SO

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.450
AGAIN AS WE BROUGHT THESE

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:41.386
PROVISIONS FORD -- AND WE'VE

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:42.720
KIND OF TALKED ABOUT IT MORE AND

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:44.222
MORE WHAT HAS REALLY COME TO

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:46.457
LIGHT IS -- WE NEED TO FIGURE

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:49.093
OUT A WAY TO PROTECT THOSE

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.762
VEHICLES THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE

00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:51.629
MARKET THE VEHICLES THAT ARE

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:52.964
GOING TO COME INTO THE MARKET

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.731
BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:54.465
BILL.

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:59.404
SO THAT THEY DO NOT END UP

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.438
HAVING ANY TROUBLE MOVING

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:01.239
FORWARD BUT THE REALITY IS THEY

00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:01.773
WERE BASED ON SOME KIND OF

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:02.707
LEASING RATE AND A FINANCING

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:03.474
DEAL.

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:04.809
EXPECTING A LIKE KIND EXCHANGE

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.110
IS GOING TO BE THERE AND NOW WE

00:34:06.177 --> 00:34:07.378
ARE CHANGING THE RULES OF THE

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:08.646
GAME RIGHT UNDERNEATH THEM.

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:09.881
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:10.748
YOU WOULD LIKE TO WORK THE

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:12.283
ADMINISTRATION EVERYONE TO TRY

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.684
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROTECT TO

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:15.086
THAT GROUP OF VEHICLES -- BUT

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:17.255
UNTIL WE CAN DO THAT WE CONTINUE

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:19.290
OUR MAIN OPPOSE THANK YOU.

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:20.425
GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS THE

AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS JUST

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:26.731
WANT TO REITERATE THE POINTS

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.666
THAT THAT MY COLLEAGUE MADE --

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:30.134
CERTAINLY ARE OPPOSITION TO THE

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:31.702
BILL AND THE MEASURE IS NOT

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:33.538
ABOUT THE E. I. T. C. IT IS

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:35.973
ABOUT THIS JUST THIS ONE PART OF

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.342
THE BILL -- AND SPECIFICALLY

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.077
HIGHLIGHTING THE ISSUE WITH

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:42.580
RESPECT TO THE TWO CATEGORIES OF

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.182
LEASES THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE.

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:45.783
THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL ARE

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.185
RETROACTIVE.

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:49.987
AND SO WE'VE GOT LEASES ENTERED

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:52.323
INTO AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.459
THE BILL AND THAT'S ONE SET OF

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:55.927
LEASES.

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:57.528
BUT THIS BILL IS RETROACTIVE AND

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.230
APPLIES TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:01.899
OF LEASES THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:03.634
DEALS THAT WERE MADE PEOPLE

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:05.036
GETTING INTO THOSE VEHICLES

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:07.572
BASED ON A KNOWN SET OF FACTORS

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:08.272
BOTH.

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:10.875
TAX AND FINANCIAL AND OTHERWISE

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:13.010
THAT ARE NOW BEING THROWN INTO

00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:14.111
CHAOS HERE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:17.348
THE RETROACTIVE NATURE OF OF THE

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:18.983
PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.285
AND I THINK YOU KNOW -- FROM

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:23.120
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE WE

00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:25.423
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW ON

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.724
A LOOKING FORWARD BASIS --

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:28.125
THERE'S A THERE'S A POLICY

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:29.894
DISCUSSION TO BE HAD BUT WE

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.462
THINK IS A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS.

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:33.164
PEOPLE OF ALREADY ENTERED INTO

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:36.267
TRANSACTIONS -- SHOULD PROBABLY

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:38.369
BE HELD HARMLESS BY THIS

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:43.921
BUT CERTAINLY.

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:45.723
IF THE FISCAL SITUATION IMPROVES

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.291
IN FUTURE YEARS THAT IS

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.593
SOMETHING THAT THE

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.194
ADMINISTRATION WOULD CERTAINLY

00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:52.430
LOOK AT IN IN JUST JUST TO

00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:53.597
CLARIFY THE WAY THAT THE

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:54.465
AGREEMENT WENT WAS.

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:56.033
ARMED -- THERE WAS REALLY DESIRE

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.169
TO GET UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND TO

00:38:58.235 --> 00:38:59.804
GET THAT INCOME LEVEL SO IT

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:00.805
MEANT A LITTLE BIT OF A TRADE

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:01.539
OFF WHERE.

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:03.441
YOU QUICKLY HAVE DONE MORE FOR

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:04.975
THE CURRENT INCOME POPULATION WE

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:07.278
SITE TO EXPAND. TO THE HIGHER

00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:08.713
INCOME POPULATION BUT IT MEANT

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.014
THAT PER.

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:12.149
PER FAMILY THEY THEY WILL BE

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:14.885
ABLE TO DO AS MUCH SO THAT'S

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:17.988
PART OF THE TRADE OFF AS WELL --

00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:19.523
YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.258
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.327
CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE AND I

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:25.996
REALLY HOPE -- THAT THAT IS THE

00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:27.932
CASE YOU KNOW I THINK I TEN

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:30.367
FAMILIES AND FILERS CONTRIBUTE.

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:32.303
A LOT TO OUR STATE AND I THINK

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:33.838
THEY ALSO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:35.372
CREDIT AND THAT'S SOMETHING.

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:36.640
I WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON AND

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:37.908
MAKING SURE THAT.

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.376
WE DO INCLUDE THEM.

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:41.545
THANK YOU.

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:42.146
I THINK YOU BRING UP AN EXTRA

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:44.281
POINT AGAIN -- THIS IS A TAX

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.150
CREDIT FOR WORKING FAMILIES SO

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:48.119
IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO INCLUDE

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:50.387
ALL WORKING FAMILIES IN THAT IN

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:51.722

THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:53.357
ABLE TO GET DONE THIS TIME WE

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:55.826
WOULD ANTICIPATE BRING IT UP

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:58.796

WORKING HERE IN THIS INSTITUTION

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:37.101
IN SOME SOME LEVEL OR ANOTHER

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:37.401
[inaudible]

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:40.805
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN IN NINETEEN

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:43.908
YEARS SO MUCH CONSTERNATION.

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:45.309
ATTACK CONFORMITY.

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:47.011
SO I THOUGHT WELL I'M GETTING

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:48.712
OLD MY HAIR'S GETTING GRAY MAYBE

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:49.947

ALWAYS CONFORMED THERE'S TWO

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:57.087
DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONFORMITY

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:58.389
BOTH SPECIFIC AND THEN KIND OF

00:40:58.455 --> 00:41:01.025
MORE ON THE BY STATE APPROPRIATE.

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:01.959
IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS WITH

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:02.560
THEM BOTH.

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:08.132
RIGHT -- SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:08.766
FIFTEEN TWENTY TEN TWO THOUSAND

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.433
FIVE WE DID SPECIFIED CONFORMITY

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.736
WHICH LOCK YOUR BILL IN

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:13.037
[inaudible]

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:16.006
NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND WE ALL I

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.541
THINK ACCEPT CONFORMITY IT IS

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:19.210
KIND OF A BASIC GOOD TENNIS

00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:20.578
RIGHT THIS IS IT IS BETTER

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:23.848
BETTER COMPLIANCE LESS PENALTIES --

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:25.649
EASIER ON THE TAXPAYER WHICH IS

00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:27.418
WHY WE WE DO THOSE THINGS EVEN

00:41:27.484 --> 00:41:29.186
THOUGH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:30.321
GOVERNMENT OFTENTIMES.

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:32.189
CAN'T FIND AGREEMENT ON MORE

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.058
GENERAL POLICY ISSUES.

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:36.427
AND I WHILE I DON'T ACCEPT

00:41:36.493 --> 00:41:38.229
CONFORMITY IS JUST A BLANK CHECK

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.530
GOOD THING BECAUSE CONFORM WITH

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.398
BAD FEDERAL TAX POLICY IS

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:43.534
CERTAINLY SOMETHING I THINK WE

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:43.868
WANT.

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.569
TO AVOID AND I THINK IN SOME

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:47.671
DEGREE THE PACKAGE THAT MR TANG

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:50.708
AND LEADERSHIP NEGOTIATED -- IS

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.877
A LITTLE JUICE RIGHT GIVEN THE

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:55.346
FACT THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES.

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:59.149
BUT YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER HAND --

00:41:59.216 --> 00:41:59.917
BOB LET ME GIVE A SPECIFIC

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:01.819
EXAMPLE SIX SAMPLE OF OF TAX

DON'T TAXES.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:13.397
TWENTY TWO THAT'S AN AREA WHERE

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:13.964
I WOULDN'T WANT TO JOIN THE

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.132
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAXING OUR

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:17.001
SENIORS AS THEIR TRYING TO MAKE

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:19.436
ENDS MEET -- BUT FOR THE MOST

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:20.371
PART AGAIN I THINK IT'S POSITIVE

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:20.971
THING.

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.606

VOTE THIS AND THAT THE NEXT

00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:29.847

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:45.863
FIFTEEN I KERRY WHEN I WAS.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:46.430
THE PREVIOUS CHAIR OF THIS

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.065
COMMITTEE AND I THINK THAT WAS

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:49.133
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE

00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:51.135
DECIDED TO MAKE THIS A A BILL

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:53.437
WHICH ARE ARE ARE CHAIR WOMAN IS

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:53.904
CARING.

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:57.274
BECAUSE THAT YEAR THERE REALLY

00:42:57.341 --> 00:42:58.175
WASN'T MUCH.

00:42:58.242 --> 00:42:59.576
CONSTERNATION AND THERE REALLY

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:02.913
WASN'T -- ANY CONTROVERSY ABOUT

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.547
THAT PARTICULAR BAILEY WAS JUST

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:04.748
STRAIGHT.

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:06.951
STREAMLINING OF THE TAX PAYING

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:09.286
PROCESS WHICH I THINK OVERALL

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:10.487
MOST PEOPLE WERE IN FAVOR OF

00:43:10.554 --> 00:43:11.989
SERVICE AGAIN I THINK.

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.524
WE APPRECIATE THE MINISTRATIONS

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.759
ON THAT DISCUSSION TO THIS POINT

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.394
AND TO REALLY TURN OVER INTO A

00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:18.395
LEGISLATIVE BILL BUT I THINK

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:19.563
THAT'S WHERE ULTIMATELY.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:20.364
WE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:21.899
COMFORTABLE TO LET IT GO THROUGH

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.067
THE POLICY PROCESS SO THAT WE

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:23.734
COULD.

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.502
YOU KNOW REALLY HAVE A OF FULLER

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:28.939
VETTING OF THAT OF THAT

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:29.239
[inaudible]

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:31.442
THIS BILL.

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:32.643
IT WILL FOLLOW UP QUESTION

THE AUTHOR AS WELL IF THAT'S

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:37.881
APPROPRIATE LANDING SPOT BUT

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:38.882
WILL THIS BE THE ULTIMATE

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:39.883
VEHICLE SENT DOWN TO THE

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.819

00:43:45.055 --> 00:43:46.156
SO.

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:48.926
THERE IS A A MIRROR OF THIS BILL

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:51.662
BEING VOTED ON I THINK.

IN OUR REGULAR ASSEMBLY BILL

00:44:59.363 --> 00:44:59.930

EVERY DAY IS A NEW ADVENTURE

00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:11.408
YEAH -- SO YES I UNDERSTAND.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:14.278

SURE WHAT PROVISION YOU WERE

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:54.384
TALKING ABOUT BUT I THINK IT'S

00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:56.353

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:10.434

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. HUNDRED

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:29.586
AND TWENTY I THINK -- I AM

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:31.121
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I DON'T

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:33.090
KNOW WHETHER THERE IS TIME AND

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:35.859
ABILITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:36.960

THAT WE COULD DEAL WITH THAT.

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.283

00:48:53.196 --> 00:48:56.700
AND THEN IT'S IT'S DONE -- BUT

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:59.269
THIS IS GENERATING -- SO THIS IS

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:01.238
ONE POINT SIX BILLION IN IN

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:02.706
REVENUE BECAUSE WE ARE

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:04.341
CONFORMING TO MANY PIECES OF THE

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:07.144
FEDERAL TAX CODE BUT NOT ALL OF

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.446
THEM -- THE ONE CONCERN THAT THE

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:10.914
AUTOMAKERS HAD BROUGHT UP IN

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:13.550
REGARDS TO LIKE KIND EXCHANGES --

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.453
IS THIS THAT ON THE FEDERAL SIDE --

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.055
THE PROVISIONS CHANGE BUT THEN

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.156
THEYALSO ENDED UP WITH A BOB

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:21.625
WITH BONUS DEPRECIATION -- YET

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:22.726
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HERE IN

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:25.529
CALIFORNIA NINE I KNOW THAT --

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:26.430
FACT I'M LOOKING AT THIS NUMBER

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:28.165
I'M I'M SURE I GOT THIS AT THIS

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:29.733
IS MY STAFF FOR THE FATHERS WERE

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.601
LOOKING AT THIS BUT THERE IS ONE

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.737
POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.305
THIS YEAR IN REVENUE IT'S GONNA.

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:37.507
DECLINE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:41.011
OF YEARS BUT THIS ISN'T REVENUE

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:44.748
NEUTRAL -- THE EITC EXPANSION IS

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:46.083
SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND EXISTING

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.685
E. I. T. C. IS ALREADY -- FOUR

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:50.020
HUNDRED MILLION AND SO THERE'S

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:52.222
AN EXTRA SIX HUNDRED MILLION --

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:54.324
OUT THERE AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:56.159
ABOUT LIKE KIND ON THE LIKE KIND

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:57.661
EXCHANGE AT LEAST THE IMPACT IT

00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:59.963
WOULD BE SOME AROUND TWO HUNDRED

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:04.101
AND FORTY MILLION.

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:05.602
SO I WOULD THINK EVEN THOUGH. TO

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:06.269
OUR THIRTY EIGHT MILLION AS WHAT

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:06.903
I HAVE IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.472
WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:10.674
TO BE ABLE TO TO FIGURE THIS OUT

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:11.908
IS THERE ANY ROOM AT ALL FOR

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:13.210
NEGOTIATIONS.

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:14.611
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS I

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:15.512
KNOW WE GET THIS OUT OF OUR

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:17.180
COMMITTEE WE CAN'T AMEND IT --

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.149
ON THE FLOOR I UNDERSTAND THERE

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:19.916
ARE SOME OTHER BUT TIME

00:50:19.983 --> 00:50:20.884
CONSTRAINTS IT THERE BUT IT

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.853
SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:24.488
TO GET EVERYBODY THAT TO BE ONE

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:26.590
BIG HAPPY FAMILY ON THIS -- OF

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:27.758
THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:29.726
THINGS THAT WE CAN IT CAN WORK

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:33.597
OUT AS OR ANY TIME FOR THAT.

00:50:33.663 --> 00:50:34.564
SO I'LL SPEAK FOR THE

00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:36.299
ADMINISTRATION -- AND THE

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:37.934
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.536
THE KEY THING HERE IS THAT THE

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:40.904
BUDGET I KNOW PASSED OFF THE

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:42.072
FLOOR LAST WEEK.

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:43.740
AND THIS PACKAGE -- WITH ITS

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:46.143
REVENUES AS WELL AS THE EITC IS

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:47.677
PRETTY ESSENTIAL TO THE OVERALL

00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:49.546
BUDGET PACKAGE -- AND IN FACT

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:51.415
THE BUDGET THAT WAS ADOPTED

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:53.150
ASSUME THE REVENUES THAT WERE IN

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:55.018
THIS PACKAGE SO WE DO BELIEVE

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:57.087
THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL. TO GET

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:58.688
THESE REVENUES -- BEFORE THE

00:50:58.755 --> 00:50:59.956
GOVERNOR CAN ACTUALLY SIGNED THE

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:01.725
BUDGET ON WITH REGARD TO THE

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:03.393
SPECIFICS OF THE ONE POINT SIX

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.595
BILLION -- BEING LARGER THAN THE

00:51:05.662 --> 00:51:07.664
ONE BILLION OF THE EITC A COUPLE

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.366
OF BRIEF POINTS FIRST I THINK AS

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:10.767
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED --

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.335
THAT ONE POINT SIX BILLION IS

00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:14.137
HIGH IN THE FIRST YEAR BECAUSE

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:15.605
IT OF A QUIRK OF TIGHTENING AND

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:17.374
OVER TIME IT ACTUALLY DECLINES

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.675
TO ONE POINT THREE BILLION SO

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:19.643
THAT THE CREDIT.

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:21.111
AND THE REVENUE ARE MUCH MORE

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:22.646
ALIGNED AND THAT WAS ALWAYS THE

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.614
PURPOSE IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:25.916
THIS TALK INFORMALLY PACKAGE IN

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:29.753
pBENEFITS THAT WE DISCUSSED.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.121
I THINK THE SECOND THING IS THAT

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:32.689
THESE REVENUES ARE UNCERTAIN

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:34.090
BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:51:34.157 --> 00:51:35.625
THAT WERE ADOPTING MANY OF THESE

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:36.626
PROVISIONS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:38.428
GOVERNMENT ADOPTED IN JUST OVER

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:39.062
A YEAR AGO.

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.497
SO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:41.965
FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION ARE

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:43.366
WORKING TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:44.901
THESE ESTIMATES AND WE NAY

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:46.269
OVERSHOOT WE MAY UNDER SHOOT IN

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:47.504
TERMS OF ONE THE MONEY ACTUALLY

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.272
COMES AND BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:50.707
SURE THAT WE WERE CONSERVATIVE

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:52.008
IN THOSE ESTIMATES BECAUSE IF

00:51:52.075 --> 00:51:52.342
THE REVENUE.

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:54.644
DOES COME IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED --

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:55.745
THAT COULD LEAVE A BIG HOLE IN

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:57.681
THE BUDGETS WE WANT TO BE VERY

00:51:57.747 --> 00:51:58.748
CAREFUL SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT

00:51:58.815 --> 00:52:00.283
OF A BUFFER THERE AND THEN THE

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:01.818
FINAL THING IS IN TERMS OF THE

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:03.987
BUDGET AGREEMENT ITSELF -- THESE

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.589
REVENUES AS MENTIONED ARE PART

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:07.157
OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT SO WHEN

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:08.725
IT COMES TO OUR PROPOSITION

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:09.559
NINETY EIGHT LEVEL WHEN IT COMES

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:10.760
TO SOME OF THE OTHER ONGOING

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.329
PROGRAMS THAT WERE INCREASED.

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:13.930
AS PART OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

00:52:13.997 --> 00:52:14.965
LEGISLATURE.

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:16.833
ON THOSE ARE ALREADY TAKING AND

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.368
THESE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE PART

00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:19.903
OF THIS BILL -- SO WE DO THINK

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.571
AT THIS POINT IT WOULD BE HARD

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.473
TO UNWIND -- ELEMENTS OF THE

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.541
BILL.

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:27.310
I HAVE A QUESTION ON THAT IT

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:27.978
MEDICARE I DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE

00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:28.912
BUT THAT'S FINE.

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.146
IS ON THAT SITE ON IT.

00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:35.785
DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE AS TO IF

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:37.254
WE DON'T WITH THE ACTUAL

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.522
RETROACTIVITY PORTION HOW MUCH

00:52:38.588 --> 00:52:38.922
THAT WOULD COST.

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:40.724
SO I I WILL MAKE ONE COMMENT

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:41.658
ABOUT THAT AND THEN I MAY DEFER

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:42.259
TO MY COLLEAGUES A CHAMBER ONE

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.059
AS WELL WHO'S WITH ME FROM THE

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:43.560
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:44.327
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:46.463
THIS PROVISION -- IS RETROACTIVE

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.798
TO JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR IS

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:50.400
THAT CORRECT.

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:51.535
ACTUALLY TO JANUARY TENTH OF

00:52:51.601 --> 00:52:52.168
THIS YEAR THAT'S RIGHT JANUARY

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:53.136
TENTH OF THIS YEAR AND THE

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:54.437
REASON WE CHOSE THAT DATE IS

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:55.238
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.107
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS PUT OUT --

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:58.842
JANUARY NINTH I BELIEVE ACTUALLY

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:00.777
AND SO WHILE THIS BILL MAY NOT

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:02.846
BE PASSED UNTIL NEXT WEEK OR OR

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:04.514
WHATEVER THE PASSAGE STATE IS --

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:05.515
WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.650
GOVERNOR PUT ITS BUDGET OUT --

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:08.018
EVERYONE WAS ON NOTICE THAT

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.486
THESE PROVISIONS COULD BE IN THE

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:11.588
LAWS SO WE DON'T THINK THAT

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:12.656
THERE IS REALLY NO NEED OF

00:53:12.722 --> 00:53:14.391
SURPRISE HERE WITH REGARD TO

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:15.091
THESE PROVISIONS.

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:16.459
I THINK I WOULD AGREE TO

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:18.295
DISAGREE BUT SO eYOU

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:19.663
AMOUNT FROM THE APARTMENT OF

00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:20.864
FINANCE OF WHAT THE COST OF

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:21.898
RETRO OF REMOVING THE RIGHT I

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:23.400
JUST SO THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER.

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:25.335
OF THE RETROACTIVITY WOULD COST

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:27.070
WHAT IT WOULD COST TO TAKE I DO

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:28.305
NOT HAVE NOTS IN FACT I'M NOT.

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.206
REALLY CLEAR WHAT THAT PROPOSAL

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:34.444
WOULD BE OKAY ALL RIGHT THINKING

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:34.744
[inaudible]

00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:37.781
BUT YEAH.

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:38.381
AND IT ACTUALLY A MINUTE ON

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:38.982
CHANGE GEARS HERE FOR JUST A

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.583
LITTLE BIT ACTUALLY IT WAS A

00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:41.284
LITTLE FASCINATED -- TO HEAR

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:43.653
ABOUT THIS YOUNG CHILD -- BUT

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.488
TAX CREDIT -- SO THAT AS A

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:47.691
REFUNDABLE CREDIT AS WELL RIGHT

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:52.462
SO THAT'S UP -- FOR BUT BUT SO.

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:53.096
BECAUSE IT'S NEW AND HAVEN'T HAD

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:53.763
A WHOLE TIME THE TO DIG INTO IT

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.998
CAN I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY GIVE A

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.433
GIVE A BRIEF ON THAT OF HOW

00:53:56.499 --> 00:53:57.901
THAT'S GOING TO WORK.

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.636
AND THEN PART OF THAT TOO IS

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:00.904
DOES IT START ON THE FIRST

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:02.939
DOLLAR OF MADE OF GOT A BRIEF

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.608
HERE FROM THE CAL BUDGET CENTER.

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:06.109
AND IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FROM

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.777
WHAT I CAN TELL I DON'T HAVE THE

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:10.246
COLOR CODING PROPER -- BUT DOES

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:11.448
THAT START ON THE FIRST DOLLARS

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:12.549
OF SOMEBODY MAKES A HUNDRED

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:13.617
DOLLARS OR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:15.185
IN FILES I DO THEY GET A

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:16.186
THOUSAND ARE TAX CREDIT OR DOES

00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:16.686
THAT.

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:19.289
BEGIN TO SCALE UP LIKE THE REST

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:20.457
OF THE HTC.

00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:21.591
SURE SO MAKE TWO COMMENTS ON

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:23.727
THAT I THINK FIRST IS ONE THING

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.061
THAT WE REALIZED IN SPEAKING

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.596
WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THE EITC.

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:28.198
IS IT IS IT CAN BE A VERY

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:29.766
COMPLICATED PROPOSAL SO WHEN YOU

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:30.967
WALK UP TO SOMEONE ON THE STREET

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.168
AND SAY HEY THE EARNED INCOME

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.003
TAX CREDIT.

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.437
OFTENTIMES PEOPLE MAY NOT EVEN

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.006
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING AND

00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:36.773
THEN THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.875
PEOPLE TO CLAIM THE BENEFIT SO

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.443
WHAT WE REALIZED WITH THIS BILL

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.970
THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND I

WANT TO EXPAND IDC AND THAT IT'S

00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:51.541
A GOOD PROGRAM I THINK.

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:54.043
MY CONCERN IS THE PROFILE OF THE

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.745
TAX PAYERS THAN THAT ARE GOING

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.046
TO BE FUNDING US AND I'D LOVE

00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:58.148

UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I THINK

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:01.885
I HAVE A CONCERN THAT.

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:02.852
A LOT OF THESE FOLKS AREN'T YOU

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:04.187

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:05.355
AND AND YOU KNOW.

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:07.357
FACELESS CORPORATIONS MY CONCERN

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:08.725
IS THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE THE

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:09.325
SAME FOLKS THAT WERE ACTUALLY

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:10.026
HAD.

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:13.530
QUITE ADVERSELY BY THE TRUMP TAX

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:14.697
CHANGES.

00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:16.599
AND THAT THEY WEREN'T THE PEOPLE

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.201
WHO ENJOYED A WINDFALL -- AND

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.402
THAT THIS WILL IN FACT BE KIND

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.771
OF A DOUBLE THE DOUBLE KNOCK FOR

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:22.272
THEM SO CAN YOU HELP ME

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:23.540
UNDERSTAND.

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.842
THAT LION SHARE THE INDIVIDUAL

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:26.476
BUSINESS CENTERS THAT ARE GONNA

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:27.277
BE.

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:28.945
PAYING THE LION'S SHARE OF THIS

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:32.649
INCREMENTAL REVENUE WHAT'S THE

00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:33.750
PROFILE OF THOSE FOLKS.

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:35.118
YES WE CAN ADD A COUPLE FACTS --

00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:36.186
THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:37.987
PERSON LOOKS LIKE I THINK THE

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:38.755
FIRST THING TO THINK ABOUT IS

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:39.589
THAT.

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:41.491
THE ACCESS BUSINESS LOSSES ARE

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:45.161
ONLY FOR LOSSES IN EXCESS OF

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:45.762
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.797
THAT'S FOR A MARRIED COUPLE SO

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:49.132
ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS THAT IF

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:51.401
YOU IF YOU'RE AND YOUR SPOUSE.

00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:53.603
MAKE LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:54.704
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A GIVEN YEAR

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:55.905
THAN THIS BILL WILL NOT AFFECT

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:57.507
YOU IN THAT YEAR YOU WOULD STILL

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.175
BE ABLE TO DEDUCT -- ANY

00:57:59.242 --> 00:58:00.844
BUSINESS LOSSES AN OFFSET THAT

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:02.679
OTHER INCOME -- WITH REGARD TO

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:05.048
THE PEOPLE WHO DO MAKE MORE THAN

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:05.715
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:07.450
A GIVEN YEAR -- WE'VE LOOKED AT

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:08.918
THE DATA AND THE BEST OUT OF

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:10.119
THAT WE HAVE I THINK FROM THE

00:58:10.186 --> 00:58:12.322
YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN SHOWS THAT

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:13.756
THIS PROVISION WOULD AFFECT

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:15.692
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:17.293
1-000-021-1000 TAXPAYERS.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.528
AND THAT THE AVERAGE INCOME OF

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:21.931
THESE TAXPAYERS IS THREE POINT

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:35.678
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS.

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:36.746
ANY OTHER WEIGHT WHEN COULD LOVE

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:38.147
DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE LIKE A A

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:40.617
CHART THAT WE CAN SEE THAT DOES

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:41.985
SO THE AVERAGE IS ONE THING BUT

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.386
YOU KNOW ONE PERSON EARNING A

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:43.887
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:58:43.953 --> 00:58:46.422
OBVIOUSLY LIKES USE THAT A LOT.

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:49.292
DO YOU HAVE THAT DISTRIBUTION IS

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:50.593
THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE.

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.729
WE DO NOT -- I HAVE NOT ASKED

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:54.063
FOR THAT IT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:56.633
TO GET THAT I'M NOT SURE.

00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:57.166
OKAY THANKS THAT WOULD BE

00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:58.935
HELPFUL.

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:00.503
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.773
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.308
I HAVE.

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:07.944
ONE SO -- TO MR MAYES POINT MY

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.479
QUESTION IS SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:10.580
TALKING ABOUT WITH THE I. T. C.

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:12.115
AND WHAT THE CHILD CREDIT YOUR

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:13.049
PRIMARILY STE TALKING ABOUT

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:14.050
PEOPLE WHO TRADITIONALLY DON'T

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:16.052
ACTUALLY WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:17.754
TO ENCOURAGE A PILOT TAX RETURN.

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.222
SO THAT THEN THEY GET THE CREDIT

00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:21.858
SO IN YOUR OPINION HOW OFTEN

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:23.126
WOULD YOU FIND SOMEBODY WHO

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:25.161
MAKES A HUNDRED DOLLARS WHO IS

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:27.163
GOING TO FILE FOR THE TAX CREDIT

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.299
FOR THE CREDIT FOR THE CHILD TAX

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:30.533
CREDIT.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.200
BECAUSE YOU MUST HAVE CALCULATED

00:59:31.267 --> 00:59:33.069
SOME ERROR OR SOME PORTION FOR

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.504
THAT.

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.039
YES A FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IT'S

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.173
AN ONGOING CHALLENGE TO GET

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.741
PEOPLE TO FILE FOR THE CREDIT SO

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:40.443
I THINK WE'RE ATTACKING THAT

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.278
ISSUE IN TWO WAYS ONE IS BY

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:44.047
MAKING THE MESSAGE MUCH SIMPLER --

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:45.381
IT'S EASIER TO GET THE MESSAGE

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:47.183
OUT THERE -- AND THEN THE SECOND

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.551
THING IS ACTUALLY INCREASING OUR

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:50.019
OUTREACH EFFORTS SO THE BUDGET

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:51.354
AGREEMENT ADOPTED BY THE

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:53.089
LEGISLATURE LAST WEEK INCLUDES

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:54.524
TEN MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.458
FOR OUR REGION.

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:56.960
ACTUALLY THE ADMINISTRATION HAD

00:59:57.026 --> 00:59:57.794
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN

00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:58.928
THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS THROUGH THE

00:59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.330
CONFERENCE PROCESS THAT AMOUNT

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:01.431
WAS DOUBLE TO TEN MILLION

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:02.899
DOLLARS SO IT IS A CHALLENGE

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.334
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THRESHOLD

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.301
FOR FILING.

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.703
STATE TAXES IS DIFFERENT FROM

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.604
FEDERAL BUT WE'RE HOPING BUT

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:09.806
THAT MUCH SIMPLER MESSAGE IF YOU

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.341
HAVE A KID UNDER SIX YOU CAN GET

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:12.742
A THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU MAKE

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:13.576
LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:14.177
DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:15.979
AND WITH ACTUAL MONEY TO MATCH

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.413
THE EFFORTS ON THE GROUND

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.715
INCLUDING MANY OF THE FOLKS HERE

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.450
CORRUGATION CANADIAN FOR TO GET

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:22.218
THE WORD OUT WE THINK WE COULD

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.252
REACH A LOT OF THAT POPULATION.

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:24.754
SO THEORETICALLY TRADITIONALLY

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.122
SOMEONE WHO MADE UNDER A

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:27.223
THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU ARE HAVING

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.558
TROUBLE GETTING THEM FILE AT ALL

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:29.258
SO THAT.

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:30.426
THE REALLY THE CHANCES SOMEONE

01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:31.594
WHO MAKES A HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:35.264
WOULD NOT BE REALLY FILING FOR

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:35.798
THIS TO GET THEIR THOUSAND

EMPLOYMENT TAXES USE BUSES PAY

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:04.520
ON THE FEDERAL AND THAT THE

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:05.488
AMOUNT OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.089
CREDIT.

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.091
WAS OVER AND ABOVE THAT SO THERE

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.926
ARE FOLKS THAT ARE SMART THEY

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.194
ARE FOR THEIR FOLKS WHO WILL

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.528
COME IN AND WILL.

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:13.796
GAME THE SYSTEM ONE OF THE

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.431
CONCERNS THAT I HAD WHEN WE

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:16.699
FIRST IMPLEMENTED THE COW AND I

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:17.800
AM A SUPPORTER.

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.135
OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:20.903
ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.338
WAS WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO A TO

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:27.176
INCLUDE ALL FILERS OR IF IT WAS

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.311
JUST GOING TO BE FOR EMPLOYEES.

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.445
HE YOU'LL RECEIVE A W. TWO WHEN

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.046
YOU GET THAT W. TO YOU ENTER

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:32.315
THAT W. -- TO INTO THE RETURN

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:34.016
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:34.650
THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE THAT'S

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:36.419
HOLDING YOU ACCOUNTABLE AS SOON

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.754
AS YOU APPLY THIS TO ALL FILERS

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.022
WHICH I THINK IS WHERE WERE.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.524
WE ARE CURRENTLY AT SO IF YOU

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.493
OWN YOUR OWN BUSINESS YOU'LL BE

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.561
ABLE TO TO GET THIS SO SOMEBODY

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.463
THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY INCOME CAN

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:49.065
CLAIM INCOME NOW HERE'S THE ONE

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:49.732
THING.

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.134
THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.703
IS THAT -- THE UNDER FEDERAL LAW

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.738
IT IS -- THAT YOU HAVE TO CLEAN

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:57.273
ALL OF YOUR INCOME.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.774
BUT IF YOU CLAIM MORE THAN YOUR

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.543
YOUR INCOME HOW DO YOU PROVE --

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.211
THAT THAT SOMEBODY DIDN'T MAKE

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:03.646
IT THAT INCOME SO HOW TO I GUESS

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.515
MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.049
SURE THAT THERE ISN'T ANY.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.751
ANY FRAUD OR HOW DO WE AT LEAST

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:11.087
LIMIT 

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:11.988
WHEN WE'RE TALKING BUT I GUESS

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.890
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT FIRST

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:15.625
THAT FIRST DOLLAR.

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.393
YOU KNOW I'M I'M GONNA ASK FTV

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.229
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:27.036
FTV.

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:29.739
ALL MAY TWO BRIEF COMMENTS MAYBE

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.841
TAKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:32.608
OF THESE ISSUES AND THEN

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.242
EFFECTIVELY.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.343
TO WITHDRAW MANAGER I'M NOT SURE

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.178
GONNA BILL ANSYS TODAY IT'S FINE

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.612
IF YOU GUYS GET BACK TO ME IS

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:37.947
JUST A CONCERN BUT I I WISH I

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:39.115
COULD NOT THINK OF THE BEACON

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:41.951
PROBABLY ADDRESS.

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.152
THOSE CONCERNS.

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.287
YES SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:44.820
IDENTIFYING THE TRADE OFF

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:49.125
THERE'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN --

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.560
BUT ALSO GUARDING AGAINST ANY

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:52.461
POSSIBILITY OF FRAUD WHEN IT

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:53.863
COMES TO THE ITEMS IN THIS

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.265
SPECIFIC BILL I THINK THERE ARE --

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.167
TWO PLACES WHERE IT'S LESS OF A

01:03:58.234 --> 01:03:59.268
CONCERN THAN IT OTHERWISE MIGHT

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.737
BE THE FIRST IS THE FACT AS YOU

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:02.471
POINTED OUT AT SOMEONE I'M

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.473
AMAZED AT THE FACT THAT THIS IS

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.374
A THOUSAND DOLLAR FRANK.

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:06.809
WHAT CREDIT MEANS THAT IT

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.477
DOESN'T ACTUALLY VERY WITH

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:09.979
INCOME -- SO THE TYPE OF

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:10.713
GAMESMANSHIP THAT YOU WERE

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.914
REFERRING -- TO WOULDN'T HAPPEN

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:13.849
SPECIFICALLY WITH THE THOUSAND

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.251
DOLLAR YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.452
AND THEN I THINK THE SECOND

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:17.486
THING AND THIS IS -- JUST A

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:20.122
MATTER OF DEGREE -- BUT ONE OF

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.624
THE PROVISIONS IN THIS -- DALE

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:22.992
ETS AND THIS KIND OF GOES TO

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.794
WHAT YOU WERE DISCUSSING IN THE

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.196
CURRENT STATE -- EITC IT'S MUCH

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:28.864
MORE GENEROUS -- FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.533
MAKE BETWEEN A DOLLAR AND TEN

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.801
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT IT IS FOR

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:33.769
PEOPLE WHO MAKE BETWEEN TEN

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:34.770
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:35.438
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:36.339
AND THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:37.840
BECAUSE ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.642
THIS PROGRAM IS TO HELP THOSE

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.744
WHO ARE REALLY MAKING -- THE

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.412
LOWEST INCOME IN CALIFORNIA BUT

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:44.981
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID IN THIS

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:47.283
BILL -- THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS AND

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:48.184
CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.452
THE LEGISLATURE IS INCREASED

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:50.953
BENEFITS AS WELL FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.688
MAKE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:53.756
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ALSO

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.324
EXTENDING IT OUT TO THIRTY

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.459
THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THAT.

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.994
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE FLATTENED

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.528
GENEROUS IN THOSE AREAS AND SO

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:03.833
REDUCES SOME OF THE INCENTIVES

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:09.839
THAT YOU WERE DISCUSSING.

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:11.574
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THE

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:11.841
QUESTION.

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:14.910
I'M.

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:15.878
I'M SORRY MY FIRST TIME HERE

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:17.480

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.181
UP CLOSE TO YOU AND YOU DON'T

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:22.051
HAVE TO LOOK AT MR MEANS HE HE

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:22.385
CAN HEAR YOU.

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:22.985
OKAY I'M THE SIMILAR MEMBER IS

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:24.220
RIGHT THERE ARE SOME I THINK THE

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.421
TERM PEOPLEHAVE USED ARE BAD

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:26.455
ACTORS -- YOU KNOW WHO WOULD TRY

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:27.790
TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT OF THE

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.859
EXACT NUMBER OF CREDIT -- THE

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:32.561
DEPARTMENT HAS TRIED -- TO USE

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:34.430
SOPHISTICATED -- REVENUE

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.932
ANALYTICS AND PREDICTIVE MODELS --

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.968
SO THAT WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:41.103
IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW -- CLAIMS

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.705
THAT WOULD WE WOULD CONSIDER TO

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.675
BE IMPROPER -- AND IF WE

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:46.709
IDENTIFY A CLAIM THAT'S AT THE

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.444
SWEET SPOT YOU KNOW MAYBE THREE

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:49.945
CHILDREN THE EXACT NUMBER OF

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:52.848
INCOME TO GET THE EXACT TWENTY

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:53.416
EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR MAXIMUM

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:55.718
CREDIT -- THEN WE DO TRY TO SEND

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.687
OUT A CORRESPONDENCE TO THE

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:58.988
TAXPAYER AND ASK FOR

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:00.723
VERIFICATION -- MAYBE THE

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.258
TAXPAYERS CLAIMING THREE

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:04.060
CHILDREN WE IT'S SOMETHING

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.328
DIFFERENT FROM A PRIOR YEAR WE

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:06.996
MIGHT ASK FOR BIRTH CERTIFICATES

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:08.331
ARE DIFFERENT THINGS.

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:10.333
BUT WE DO TRY TO WORK WITH --

01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:11.667
THE TAXPAYER TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:15.438
THE CORRECT INDIVIDUAL IS

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:16.005
GETTING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:17.506
MONEY.

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:18.374
ON MAKE ONE OTHER POINT -- ON

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.742
THE SIMILAR TOPICS THE THOUSAND

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.043
DOLLAR CREDIT IT DOES APPLY WITH

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:22.712
THE FIRST DOLLAR OF INCOME BUT

01:06:22.778 --> 01:06:24.380
IT DOES FACE OUT SO WE'RE NOT IN

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.415
A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU MAKE.

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.049
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:29.151
OF A CHILD UNDER SIX YOU GET A

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:29.919
THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT BUT IF

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.520
YOU MAKE A DOLLAR BEYOND THAT

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:33.022
YOU LOSE THE WHOLE CREDIT THERE

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.490
IS A BUILT IN FACE DOWN

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:37.827
MECHANISM FOR THAT.

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:23.379

THAT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS IS

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:02.818
REALLY A BARRIER AND SO WHAT IT

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:05.154
FORCES THEM TO DO IN MANY CASES

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.089
IS JUST BE GOD CREATED A SOLE

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.458
