THANK YOU THE CONSULTANT NOTE THE CRIME HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHORED TODAY WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY WELCOME YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE MEMBERS NICE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. VERY NICE VERY NICE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN A WHILE FOR FIRE AREAS IS VERY PROBLEMATIC AS WE ALL KNOW. LAST YEAR WHEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED HOMEOWNERS CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL THAT I CARRIED. HE PUT ON HIS SIGNING MESSAGES THAT WE MUST DO MORE IN THIS AREA. THIS BILL I BELIEVE IS AN INNOVATIVE BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO ENCOURAGE INSURERS TO WRITE MORE POLICIES FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. IN OUR STATES HI FIRE RISK REGION'S. CURRENTLY THE ONLY OPTION FOR MANY HOMEOWNERS IS THE FAIR PLAN. THE FAIR PLAN IS IMPORTANT AND HELPFUL SO HOMEOWNERS ALWAYS HAVE AT LEAST ONE OPTION. IS FOR MANY IT'S THE CHOICE OF LAST RESORT. IT'S THE FAIR PLAN IS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IT'S EXCLUSIVELY A HIGH RISK POOL. AUTHORIZES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO FILE A SPECIFIC PLAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THE DRESSES THAT INSURERS PRACTICAL NEEDS FOR RATES AND OTHER DETAILS. CONTRATAR GIVENS BEING MADE BY OPPONENTS THE BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE OR LIMIT THE AUTHORITY OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER UNDER PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE. THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT INSURANCE REGULATION INITIATIVE ADOPTED BY THE VOTERS. DOES NOT LIMIT IN ANYWAY HIS ABILITY TO APPROVE OR REJECT A MARKET ACTION PLAN FILING. THE BILL SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZES THE COMMISSION'S PRIOR APPROVAL AUTHORITY. AND THE COMMITTEE HAS SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE HARDLY EMBRACE TO MAKE THAT POINT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. ADDITIONALLY RECENT AMENDMENTS AT A SUNSET CLAUSE AND PROVIDE DETAILS. TO THE LA- STUDY PROPOSED IN THE BILL. THESE AMENDMENTS SHOW THE COMMITMENT THAT I HAVE TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS WE WANT THIS BILL AND THE MECHANISMS IN THE BILL TO WORK. TO CREATE MORE OPTIONS AND WELL FAR AREAS FOR HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND A COMPANY FOR RIGHT THAT POLICY. IF ANY PLAN BY AN INSURER IS APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THE INSURER WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A LEGAL MANDATE TO INCREASE THE VOLUME OF POLICIES IT OFFERS. TO HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA'S HIGH FIRE RISK REGIONS AND ALL THAT WILL BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST I VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS IN CLEANING PROTOCOLS I AM INSTITUTING A LIMIT OF FOUR TESTIMONY TODAY FOR FOUR MINUTES. FOR EACH SIDE. NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE CHAMBER AND SUPPORT PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF. CAN YOU MAY BEGIN. OKAY THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF CERTAIN TAYLOR WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION. WE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND THE ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS THAT EVERYONE IS TO THE CAN HELP KEEP US ALL SAFE LET HERE WE WERE ASKED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO GET COMFORTABLE BEING UNCOMFORTABLE. AND TO WORK ON SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES HOMEOWNERS AND HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS ARE EXPERIENCING. WITH REGARD TO FINDING A POLICY FROM THE ADMITTED MARKET ENSURE. WITH THAT IN MIND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE ALONG WITH IS COMPANION BILL SB TWO NINETY TWO BY CHAIR RUBIO. PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. REQUIRES INSURERS WITH AN IMPROVED HI MAP TO WRITE IN HIGH RISK AREAS AND WILL ALSO HELP REDUCE RISK OF LOSS TO THE VISUAL HOME HARDENING A COMMUNITY WIDE MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS. AS YOU ARE AWARE CALIFORNIANS AND HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS OFTEN TURN TO THE CALIFORNIA. FAIR PLAN IS OUR ONLY OPTION. IN A OF WHEN RESORT THE FAIR PLAN GENERALLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN REGULAR INSURANCE AND PROVIDES LESS ROBUST COVERAGE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE BETTER COVERAGE AT LOWER PRICES THAN THE THEN FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE NO OTHER OPTION THAN THE FAIR PLAN. INCLUDES AN ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AYE MAP PROGRAM. NOW A OF FALSELY CLAIMED THAT THIS BILL WILL TAKE AWAY POWER FROM THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AND RAISE PRICES THAT'S- IS NOT TRUE. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN CLEARLY REQUIRES THAT ALL I MET RATE FILINGS ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. IN FACT THE SECTION TWO OF THE BILL UNEQUIVOCALLY STATE A RATE PROPOSED AS PART OF AN IMF FILING SO NOT BE EXCESSIVE INADEQUATE OR UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY AND SHALL BE ACTUALLY SOUND. AND A RATE REQUEST AND I'M NOT FILING SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE COMMISSIONER. NOW AS MR DALY NOTED THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS FURTHER CLARIFY. THAT IT MUST FOLLOW ALL OF PROP ONE OF THREE STATUTES. AND THAT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CAN SAY NO TO ANY I MET FILING FOR ANY REASON. FURTHER. THE CONSUMER ADVOCATES CAN INTERVENE JUST AS A DO TODAY. THE BILL TO NOT ALTER THE EXISTING PROBLEMS TRANSPARENCY RULES OR IN ANY WAY LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR INTO THE NURSE TO OBJECT TO ANY PART OF AN IMF FINALLY. IN REALITY ALL THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOW A MINUTE MARKET INSURERS TO MAKE A PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT. WHICH SPECIFIES HOW THEY WILL SERVE THESE HIGH RISK AREAS AT RATES THAT ARE LOWER THAN THE FAIR PLAN. TO THE EXTENT INSURANCE RATES ARE INCREASING. THAT IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING WAIT METHODOLOGY. WHICH REQUIRES A TWENTY YEAR LOOK BACK PERIOD THAT INCLUDES TWENTY SIX BILLION OF LOSSES INCURRED BY HOME INSURERS. AS A RESULT OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. IN FACT MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE LOSS RATIOS FOR THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. ANY SERIOUS SOLUTION MUST RECOGNIZE THAT REALITY AND THE NEW NORMAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE THINK THE BILL'S PROVIDE AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH THE BALANCES ENSURE RISK IN RATES IN COMBINATION WITH A STRONG EFFORT TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISK OF LOSS. AND IT IS AN APPROACH ENSURES CAN SUPPORT WITHOUT FEAR OF INSOLVENCY. IT DOWN TO ONE MINUTE PLEASE OKAY IN SHORT WE JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PROPOSAL TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THAT WILL ALLOW INSURERS TO COMPETE IN HIGH FIRE THREAT. AS PRICES OUT OF LOWER THAN THE FAIR PLAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ST JOHN OR WHAT ON WE HAVE THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS BROKERS A CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE ARE MEMBERS ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING INSURANCE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE- FOR THEIR CLIENTS IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE- HAVE INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS THE MEMBERS OF OUR GROUP THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR MORE THEY HAVE NEVER HAD A POLICY OF THE FAIR PLAN YET TO. NUMBER HE'S THE FAIR PLAN IS A UNDER. SITUATION BUT UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO A MAJOR FIRE IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE TO THE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE. NOW ARE SUBJECT TO FIRES THAT REGULARLY AND KERR TEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE SO IT IS A VERY TOUGH SITUATION HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE TENSE WHAT IS. TENSE. TWENTY ONE THIRTY SEVEN IS ON INNOVATIVE AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORTED- AS IT WAS INDICATED THAT ALLOWS INSURERS TO PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM AND REQUIRES INSURANCE COMMISSIONER APPROVAL IT DOES SO WITHIN THE TWO MAIN PARAMETERS A PROP ONE OH THREE.

FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO FAKE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD ON THIS BILL AND TRIED TO ADDRESS A LOT OF CONCERNS- THAT- WERE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED. I HAD pAND HAD SOME VERY INSIGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE SUPPORT IN THE OPPOSITION. MY BIGGEST CONCERN WITH INSURANCE COMMISSIONER BE EMPOWERED TO REJECT ANY HI MAP FILING THE DOES IT BENEFIT CONSUMERS. I DON'T WANT TO SEE STEEP RATE HIKES OR LITTLE GROWTH AND COMPETITION- IT AVAILABLE BILL THE OF PAUL IN THESE- FIRE PRONE AREAS. I SHARE MY CONCERN WITH THE CHAIR I SHARED MY CONCERNS WITH THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS RESPONDED DIRECTLY TO THAT POINT. IT OUR SHIRTS SURE HAS THE FLOOR TO ENSURE ENOUGH BE APPROVED. IF IT DOESN'T BENEFIT CONSUMERS. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT A RATE PROPOSED AS PART OF AN IMF FILING IS SUBJECT TO PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE REQUIREMENTS. PETE THAT BUT THEN A RATE PROPOSED AS PART OF AN ITEM OUT FINALLY IT IS SUBJECT TO PROP ONE OH THREE REQUIREMENTS. THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS LAST WEEK WERE ALSO A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ADDING A SUNSET PROVISION AS WELL AS REQUIRING A REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A MAP PROGRAM. I BELIEVE IT IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WILL VOTE ARE YOU TODAY. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION AND I URGE THE AUTHOR TO WORK WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND THE OPPOSITION TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE BILL. I'VE YET TO SEE DATA ON CURRENT MARKET PENETRATION- IN THE LIKELY MY AYE MAIL COUNTIES UNDERSTATING THE STATUS QUO IS IMPORTANT TO JUDGING WHETHER THE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. WE ARE MADE IN THE BILL'S BENEFICIAL. OR YOU LOSE. TWICE TO SEE THAT BEFORE THIS BILL REACHES THE FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER JONES. YOU MA'AM CHAIR IS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER STILL ON THE LINE. FOR IS HE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK. CARP HIS ASSISTANT THE TERROR- IS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THAT WOULD BE FINE TO. GNOME DIRECTOR LARA HAD DISCONNECTED. IS REPRESENTATIVE STILL HERE. WE'LL GIVE HIM A FEW MORE SECONDS I JUST HAD A CLARIFYING QUESTION ONE OF HIS COMMENTS- MISTER MARTINEZ WOULD TO LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION SURE ABSOLUTELY HE'S FROM THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE HE WILL BE TAKING THE QUESTION FORM SORRY JONES. MISTER MARTINEZ- TAKING A QUESTION FOR YOU SENSATIONS OF THERE'S NOTHING I THINK HIS ARCHES THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF CONVERSATION- THIS MORNING ALREADY ON THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS AUTHORITY BEING- I GUESS AND- INFLOW. OR CONTROLLED BY THIS PARTICULAR BILL IN ONE OF THE COMMENTS WAS AT THE- RATE REVIEW AND PROP ON ALL THREE. ARE GOING TO BE- INTERRUPTED- BY THIS BILL. ARE YOU ABLE TO CITE A SPECIFIC PARAMETERS THE BILL THAT THE CAUSES THAT CONCERN. SO LONG MAYOR SHOULD GET. THE TAXES WHILE. I WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE REASON FOR THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL AND THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BOTH SPENT. CREDIT AT A TIME AND- EFFORT ON. ONE SIDE EXPLAINING THAT IT DOESN'T ONE SIDE EXPLAINING THAT IT DOES. AND SOME JUST ONE IF THE OPPOSITION'S ABLE TO KIND OF POINT TO EXACTLY WHERE IN THE BILL THAT. THAT THE PROBLEM IS TO MARTINEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND I ALSO HAVE HERE WITH ME BRENT HANLEY A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE COMMISSIONER- BECAUSE IT'S ALSO TO SOME DEGREE TO POLICY DEBATE AS WELL AS A LEGAL DISCUSSION AND SINCE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LAWYER HERE. IN SERVICE. JUST THAT THE BOOK IN THE AND THIS IS ALL AN A AND COMPANY WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN AS OUTLINED IN THE BILL'S ANALYSIS THAT. MISSION ON THE DEPARTMENT STILL DO BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THE COMMISSION. AND THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ON THE BILL. AMENDMENTS CONTINUE TO KEEP HE BELIEVES IN THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES OVERRIDES HAS AUTHORITY. TO DENY AND I AM OUT FINALLY AND ONCE IT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT. AND SO IN OTHER WORDS THAT ONCE THE RATE ONE OF THESE RATE FILINGS IS APPROVED THEN. THE KNOWLEDGE YOU LIKE THE HORSE IS OUT OF THE BARN- IT'S OUT THERE AND THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. CAN JUST ROLL BACK TO THE PREVIOUS I'M NOT RATES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMMISSION DEPARTMENT COULD BE. PERILOUS INTERFERE WITH THE PREVIOUS RATE EVEN IF IT'S NOT% DEEMED EXCESSIVE. WITH THE INCLUSION INCORPORATION OTHER INSURANCE RATES. OF WHICH ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IT'S AN INCIDENT HARLEY GLOBAL MARKET. THAT ALSO COMPLICATES THE ABILITY FOR US TO EVEN WITH THE MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS THE LATER IN A PROP ONE OF THREE. WOULD PROHIBIT US% TO BE ABLE TO REALLY LOOK AT A LOT. THE COSTA RICAN. AND THEN ALSO THAT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL DO NOT REQUIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PRICE OR CELERY NEW INSURANCE TO HOMEOWNERS TO MEDICATE THEIR HOMES AGAINST WALL VIRUS TODAY CAPTURES WILL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- VENTURE IF I IF I COULD ASK FOR THE- AUTHOR QUESTION IF THE EXCITEMENT ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS MR DAILY- YOU KNOW AS AUTHORS OF BILLS WHENEVER THERE'S A CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN BROUGHT UP AS OF THE OPPOSITION IS RAISED- WE ALWAYS AS THE AUTHORS- WE GET A LETTER FROM LEDGE COUNCIL TELLING US THAT OUR BILLS. OUT A OR A THE POSSIBILITY OF VIOLATING EITHER THE U. S. CONSTITUTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. ALSO ANY. MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN REQUEST A LETTER OF- ASKING THE SAME QUESTION AND THEN AS THE AUTHOR THE BILL. YOUR PROVIDED A COPY OF THAT LETTER. IN ANOTHER- MEMBER ASKED THAT SAME QUESTION WHICH COUNTS ARE YOU FAMILIAR. WITH ANY OPINION FROM LEDGE COUNCIL THAT STATES THAT YOUR BILL IS POTENTIALLY A CONSTITUTIONAL. I HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH A AN OPINION- CENTER JONES- MY COMMITTEE STAFF OF PERSON IS HERE IN THE CHAMBER IF YOU'RE WILLING TO LET HIM COMMENT TO THAT OF MADAM CHAIR IS THAT ACCEPTABLE ABSOLUTELY AS HE AND THE CHAMBER. YOU MAY STEP TO THE MICROPHONE PLEASE. AND I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO AND THEN I'M DONE VENTURE. CENTER JONES IT IF THE QUESTION WHETHER LEADS COUNCIL PROVIDED- LETTER TO THE AUTHOR AT THE TIME NO THEY SUBMITTED THE INITIAL DRAFT LANGUAGE- WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO WHAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY THE ANSWER IS NO THEY DID NOT. INDICATE THAT THE BILL WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL OKAY IF ENACTED GRAY AND THEN AND ONE MORE QUESTION GIVING DIFFERENCE TO THE COMMISSIONER AND HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY IN THE REVIEW. OF ONE OR THREE DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ON- HOW THE COURTS USUALLY- FIND THESE CASES WHEN. WHEN THE COURTS ARE DECIDING A CASE BETWEEN THE COMMISSIONER AND THE LEGISLATURE- HISTORICALLY AND I KNOW THIS IS AN OPINION AND I APPRECIATE THAT TO THE COURTS GIVE DIFFERENCE TO THE PROPOSITION RECORDS GIVE DEFERENCE. TO THE LEGISLATURE. THERE'S VERY LITTLE CASE LAW. I WENT OF COMBAT YES DOUBLE THE MOTION THERE'S VERY LITTLE CASE LAW DIRECTLY ON FROM ONE OF THREE AND THE CASE LAW THAT THERE DOES EXIST ON SO CALLED FOR THE PURPOSES WAS ESSENTIALLY THE LEGISLATURE UNDOING A PROVISION OR USURPING A DIRECT. A DIRECT DELEGATION OF SPECIFIC WITH A WITH A SPECIFIC METHODOLOGY TO THE COMMISSIONER- THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE CAN CAN PROPOSE SOMETHING FOR THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO CONSIDER THAT WOULD OTHERWISE VIOLATE THIS REGULATION IS NOT THE INITIATIVE DOCTOR BUT HIS REGULATIONS- THAT HAS NEVER NOW. BELIEVE THAT- ACTIVISTS BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE COMPETITION IN THE AREA OF THIS BUT THERE'S NO COMPETITION FURTHER IS THAT. PURPOSE WHICH IS EXPRESSLY POLLUTED ONE OF THE PURPOSES PROP ONE OF THREE OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SURE I'M. I'M I'M- FIVE DANCERS OF THE IN AND AGREE THAT THE ALLEGE CAN HAS A PINE THAT THIS IS AN CONSERVE LIKE WERE. WERE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN A GOOD ROAD HERE WITH THIS BILL- AND IF THERE AT SOME POINT IN TIME DOES GET KICKED INTO THE COURTS I'M CONFIDENT THAT. IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF PILED IN THE COURTS AND SUCH AND SO I'M I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND- LOOK FOR TO MISTER DALY CONTINUING HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND- ALLEVIATING SOME OF HIS CONCERNS. THANK YOU MISTER JOHNS WE WILL NOW MOVE OVER TO SENATOR WITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. AND CAN I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I WILL ALSO ASK MISTER MARTINEZ TO- MAYBE COME TO THE MIKE TO IT FOR A FEW QUESTIONS BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO ASK THE AUTHOR A QUESTION REAL RELATED TO HIS ROLE AS THE INSURANCE- CHAIR IN THE ASSEMBLY. FATHER WAS A BILL AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY SEVEN BY LAUREN AND SALAS THAT YOU DECIDED NOT TO HEAR THAT WAS A BILL THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THIS IT ENDEAVOR DO THE DO THE VERY SAME THING THAT THIS ATTEMPT. TO LOOK. UP ALL TO AT LEAST LOOK OUT FOR THE THOSE INSURERS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE COVERED WELL I MEAN I WHAT WE WANT AND I THINK WITH THIS BILL PROPOSED REPORTS TO DO IS TO A COVER PEOPLE AND TEACHER CALIFORNIANS ARE COVERED AND I'VE FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT MORE OF CALIFORNIANS ARE YOU ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR INSURANCE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT- THERE HAS BEEN CONCERT WITH CONSIDERABLE OF. A CONSIDERABLE CHANGES IN THAT IN WHICH- IT'S BEEN HARDER RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE WILDFIRES BE FOR PEOPLE TO GET INSURED IT HAS AFFECTED MY DISTRICT SO I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF CONSTITUENTS THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE NOT BEING FAIR TO THEM SO WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY SEVEN HOURS FOR ENCOURAGED BY THAT BILL. WE ACTUALLY GOT A PRESENTATION IN OUR COMMITTEE ON THAT BILL AND WE HAD BEEN WORKING THROUGH OUR CHILDREN THROUGH THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER WITH A SOMBER ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOT OUT TO WORK ON A POLICY THAT WOULD ADDRESS THAT WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING ON THIS ISSUE. WE STEP THIS VERY THOROUGH THROUGH THIS. AND THE BILL WAS FORMULATED WITH FEEDBACK FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND IT WASN'T HURTING YOUR COMMITTEE AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU WHY WAS THAT BILL NOT HEARD. SENATOR THE BILL'S I DO HAVE SOME SIMILARITIES- MY BILL USES INCENTIVES. TO TRY TO STIMULATE THE MARKET IN THOSE HARD TO ENSURE AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. THERE MANY OF THOSE AREAS AROUND THE STATE. MISS GONZALEZ IS BILL- WAS MORE A WAS MORE OF A COMMAND AND CONTROL A TYPE OF BILL CAN I THOUGHT MY BILL WITH THE CARROT AND STICK. IN IT. THE INCENTIVES IN IT. INCLUDING SUCH FEATURES AS A SHORTER TIME PERIOD FOR REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SO THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN GET AN ANSWER AND THEN OFFER INSURANCE IN THOSE AREAS. SO MY BILL HAS SOME FEATURES THAT I THINK- WILL STIMULATE THE MARKETING GIVE CONSUMERS CHOICES- HER BILL DID NOT HAVE THOSE FEATURES IN MY OPINION- THERE WERE SOME- IN BACKGROUND DETAILS WHICH I'D RATHER NOT GO INTO IN TERMS OF THE. IN A PRESS CONFERENCE APPROACH TO CARRYING A BILL- WAS ONE FEATURE THAT TO I THOUGHT WAS UNFORTUNATE NOT MY BILL BUT THE OTHER ONE OKAY SO YOUR YOUR ANSWER LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WANTED TO LIMITED DISCUSSION ON THIS AND HAVE US ONLY HEAR YOUR BILL SO THAT THEIR BILL WOULDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE DISCUSSED ARE VOTED ON BY THE LEGISLATURE. WESSEL CAN WE ADDRESS THE MERITS OF THE BILL AT THIS TIME- I THINK THEY WERE GETTING INTO- STRANGE TERRITORY THERE WERE QUESTIONING OUT THE PROCESS OF THE ASSEMBLY. BROTHER WE SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL IF WE IF WE CANNOT INSURE THAT MADAM CHAIR BUT THE PROCESS. IS VERY IMPORTANT. TO THE LEGISLATIVE MAKING PROCESS AND I RATHER. THAT WE DO DISCUSS POLICY HERE PUBLIC POLICY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN ASSURING THAT WERE ABLE TO VOTE. ON WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR-CONSTITUENTS. AND I APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE ENORMOUS OF POWER THAT ARE THE CHAIRMAN HAS OF THE COMMITTEE TO DECIDE WHAT BELIEVE THAT THERE'S BEEN MORE SINISTER HERE. IN THIS PROCESS WHEN. ONE IDEA IS SQUASHED AND NOT EVEN DISCUSSED PUBLICLY. WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION IF THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IF THIS BILL WE NEED TO HEAR THIS YEAR MADAM CHAIR. WE NEED TO HEAR THIS BILL LET'S GET THE POLICY RIGHT. AND I HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THAT PUBLICLY. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT NOW I'M I'M- I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BUT BY THAT I'M DISAPPOINTED BY THAT CONDUCT. I'M DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR PRACTICE. AND I'D RATHER HAVE THAT DISCUSSION HERE IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME MADAM CHAIR. CHRISTINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO. I'M GOING TO MOVE ON FROM THAT SUBJECT I THINK I'VE ESTABLISHED THE INTENT. OF THOSE ACTIONS I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO. MISTER MARTINEZ NOW. THERE WAS A SPEAKER OF THAT MENTIONED AND I. I'M OFTEN. A LITTLE SKEPTICAL WHEN PEOPLE CERTAINLY NOT VERY SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT A NUMBER WAS THROWN OUT THE SUGGESTED THAT THIS BILL WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE INCREASE OF INSURANCE POLICIES BY 40% I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO INQUIRE AS TO HOW THAT NUMBER WAS DERIVED BUT IT'S VERY CONCERNING AND IF THIS LEGISLATURE ACTIONS. I WANT KNOW OF THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR SOMEONE ASKED MISTER MARTINEZ IF HE IS AWARE. OF ANY DATA FOR OF. ANY ANALYSIS THAT OF CAN PROVE OR ARGUE THAT THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN RATES FOR CONSUMERS OF OUR STATE. YES MICHAEL MARTINEZ HERE FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. WE WOULD SAY FLAT OUT THAT YES THIS BILL WILL INCREASE RATES INSURANCE RATES ON CONSUMERS AND- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE THAT EVEN A PROPONENTS WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE INCENTIVES IF YOU WILL FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO WRITE UNDER THIS BILL THAT THERE'S- ALWAYS WHAT I'VE HEARD THAT. A AND- THERE'S BEEN NO DISAGREEMENT THAT THIS BILL WILL INCREASE WILL INCREASE COSTS ON TO CONSUMERS AND POLICY HOLDERS WHO HAVE MOURNERS. WOULD YOU BUT IF I COULD JUST INTRODUCE. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT UP REVAMPING THIS PROGRAM WERE INCREASING COVERAGE OR ANY BILL THAT WE WORK TO MAKE SURE MORE PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE OF A OF A COVERED HAS TO RESULT IN AN INCREASE IT'S FOR CONSUMERS. MISTER MARTINEZ YES OF COURSE- I WOULD SAY THAT. BUT ANSWERED IN AGAIN IN A FEW WAYS IS THAT FIRSTLY WE ARE ALSO OPERATING WITH THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS OF RATE REVIEW AND APPROVAL AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DOES NOT WORK. IT AGAIN IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THIS MEASURE AND WE CAN WE ABSOLUTELY. DISAGREE WITH THAT THAT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW TODAY UNDER PROP ONE OF THREE. HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE LINING UP. AT THE DEPARTMENT WITH DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES TODAY UNDER EXISTING LAW WHICH INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE RATE REGULATION STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENT OR DUTIFULLY LOOKING THROUGH. AND POURING THROUGH AND THOSE THOSE ARE GETTING OUT THE DOOR THOSE ARE BEING APPROVED AND WE BELIEVE IN A VERY TIMELY WAY. ABOUT FOUR MONTHS- FOR GOOD MAJORITY OF THEM OR IN A FOUR MONTH TIMELINE BECAUSE PROPONENT OF THOSE IS OUR IS PASSED. THANK YOU HERE OF THE NECESSITY ONE OF THE INCENTIVES UNDER THIS MEASURE- AND SO WE WOULD AGAIN FIRST OF ALL SAY THAT. THE CURRENT PROCESS AT THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE IS NOT BROKEN WE ARE SEEING WHERE. PREMIUMS ARE RATES ARE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE COMMISSIONER ENDED FOR EXAMPLE JUST LAST YEAR AND- IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE COMMISSIONER. DELTA APPROVED. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE 92% OF RATE FILINGS THAT WERE OF HOMEOWNERS RE FILINGS THAT WERE SUBMITTED AGAIN LAST YEAR AND TWENTY NINETEEN AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE AGENDA AND THAT WOULD TO THAT EITHER CHANCE TO IS THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING INCREASES TODAY AND PREMIUMS. AND SO UNDER THIS MEASURE NOW WITH THE INCLUSION OF UNREGULATED REINSURANCE COSTS SECRET CONFIDENTIAL CATASTROPHE MODELS CLOAK FROM PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY RESTRICTING CONSUMER GROUPS FROM FULLY PARTICIPATING IN THE RATE REVIEW PROCESS AND THE FAST TRACK. ALL OF THAT IT WE BELIEVE IS GOING. TO EQUAL TO EVEN HIGHER. PREMIUMS PUSHED ON CONSUMERS AND HARD WORKING FAMILIES. AND ONE FOR THE LAST QUESTION- IT RELATES TO THE AMENDMENTS AND IN THE AMENDMENTS- THE AMENDMENT SUGGEST THAT- THE COMMISSIONERS THIRTIES COMPLETELY RESTORED BY THE BILL THAT THE- THE COMMISSIONER'S AUTHORITY IS FULLY IN PLACE NUMBER ONE AND I'D LIKE TO DO- COMMENT ON THAT AND- ANOTHER THERE'S ANOTHER AMENDMENT THAT SPECIFIES THAT THE DECISION IS NOT SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW- AGAIN I DON'T KNOW THE PROCESS I GUESS NONE OF US HERE ON THIS FLOOR PROBABLY EXPERTS IN THIS AREA OF LAW SO WE HAVE TO REALLY RELY. ON EXPERTS TO. THIS IS. THE SPECIFIED THE DECISION IS NOT SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW IS SOMEWHAT CONCERNING TO ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS OF MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT BUT IF I IF OVERALL YOU CAN GIVE ME YOUR OPINION IN TERMS OF THE AMENDMENTS. AND WHETHER- THEY ARE. OF THE HAVE THEY BEEN DRAFTED WITH YOUR SATISFACTION WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSIONER IS STILL. COMPLETELY PROTECTED AND HE MAINTAINS HIS POWER TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION IN TERMS OF WHAT. OF THE SEAS ARE INTO PLACE. MIDDLE MARK YES TWENTY SERVER SO AGAIN I MY COLLEAGUE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS LARGER LEGAL BUT IMPORTANT QUESTION- BRAIN HENLEY WHO SERVES AS THE COMMISSIONER SPECIAL COUNSEL WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AT A HIGH LEVEL. GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER HUESO AND COLLEAGUES- BRIAN HANLEY SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YES THE SUGGESTION OF AMENDMENTS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT THE- DECISION OF THE COMMISSIONER NOT TO HOLD A HEARING IS NOT SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW IS DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO AT LEAST TWO PROVISIONS OF PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE. AND SO BY THE VERY TERMS OF THAT PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD NOT FURTHER THE PURPOSES OF PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE AND COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT THAT AMENDMENT MEANS DOES THAT MEAN THAT- THE RATE PAYERS COULD NOT. CONTEST THE DECISION. THAT THAT IS THE LANGUAGE THAT SUGGESTS THE COMMISSIONER WITH WHEN HE CHOOSES NOT TO ALLOW. AND A PROPOSED ON A MAP RATE TO BE APPROVED AT THAT DECISION IS NOT RECOUP YOUR VIEW WILL BY A COURT THAT IS CORRECT CENTER HUESO. WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IS CONSUMERS COULD NOT CHALLENGE THAT DECISION OSTENSIBLY THE WAY THAT WORDING HIS PROPOSED. THAT VIOLATES PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE WHICH SAYS THAT QUOTE ON QUOTE. PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE ANY ACTION OF THE COMMISSIONER. THAT'S INSURANCE CODE SECTION. EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE ONE ZERO. THE DISH. PROPER ONE PRE PROVIDES THAT A THIS TO DENY A FLING. AND NOT TO HOLD A HEARING IS A FINAL DECISION THAT IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE COURTS THAT PROVISION FROM PROP ONE OF THREE. IS INSURANCE CODE SECTION ONE EIGHT SIX ONE POINT ZERO NINE SO SENATOR WHO IS A TO YOUR QUESTION IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE WAY THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT IS STATED. CONSUMERS FROM CHALLENGING THE COMMISSIONER'S DECISION NOT TO APPROVE AN AYE MAP. WHEN IN FACT PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE SAYS QUITE THE OPPOSITE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE EVEN THE COMMISSIONER'S DECISIONS. NOT TO APPROVE FILINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND REGARDING THE POWER OF. THE COMMISSIONER HAS THAT BEEN RESTORED BY THE AMENDMENTS. SERVE AWAY SO IT IS NOT BEEN RESTORED BY THE AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS WHILE MAKING REFERENCE TO PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE BECAUSE THEY MUST BECAUSE PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE SAYS THAT ALL INSURANCE RATES ARE SUBJECT TO THE COMMISSIONERS PRIOR APPROVAL SO WHAT THAT PROVISION SAYS IS WHAT ALREADY EXISTS THROUGH PROPOSITION ONE OF. THE CONCERNS IN THIS MATTER ARE THAT IT CREATES A NEW EXCESSIVE STANDARD IN THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. IT ADDITIONALLY PROVIDES IF THE COMMISSIONER CHOOSES NOT TO APPROVE A SUBSEQUENT LINEUP FILING THE INSURER HAS A SAFE HARBOR AUTOMATIC RIGHT INTO THE PRIOR BATES. WILD AND APPROVED BY THE COMMISSIONER. AND THAT THE DID THEY COME DOESN'T HAVE A TO ENFORCE PROMISES THAT THE INSURER MADE IN THE ORIGINAL FILING. THESE ARE ALL WAYS IN WHICH THIS IS CONTRARY TO PROPOSITION ONE OH THREE WHICH GAVE TO THE COMMISSIONER AND NOT TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THIS MEMBERSHIP. GAVE TO THE COMMISSIONER THE BEST AND EXCLUSIVE POWER TO DECIDE HOW RATE MAKING IS TO BE DETERMINED. AND NOT GO ON AND I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF BILLS HAVE BEEN OF REMOVED FROM CONSIDERATION BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT AND WITH THAT THAT'S A LEGISLATURE WERE ONLY REALLY CONSIDERING THE MOST IMPORTANT BILLS AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING OUR STATE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN HOW WHAT ARE REPAIRS PAY. WHAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE COVERED THIS IS SOMETHING THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO SOLVE WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER BOTH HOUSES TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND I AND I WAS FEELING IN COURAGE THAT ARE ARE CHAIR THROUGH. OF TO OUR COMMISSIONER WORKING THE BILL THAT WOULD JUST DO THAT. I'VE ONLY A BIG GUN TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND I'VE ALREADY EXPOSED TO REAL THINGS. THAT JUST TO NOT MEET. MY SATISFACTION BUT THIS BILL IS REALLY- THIS BILL WAS REALLY WRITTEN TO. REPRESENT THE INSURED THE RATE PAYERS. THAT WE'RE LIMITING JUDICIAL REVIEW. IS A VERY SAD THING TO CONSIDER TODAY I HOPE THAT ALL OF YOU AGREE. THAT IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE IN THIS BILL THAT WE DO NOT- THAT WE TAKE AWAY THE CITIZENS RIGHT TO REVIEW DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEIR LIVES IN VERY PROFOUND WAYS WHY WOULD WE DO THAT AS A LEGISLATURE. AND THAT. THIS PURPORTS TO CONTINUE TO RESTORE THE UP. A THE POWER OF THE OF COMMISSIONER I HOPE ALL OF YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. AND FOR THAT REASON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I'D LIKE TO CONSIDER IT AT CONTINUE ASKING QUESTIONS BUT TO MY- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE- I'VE I'VE A- PRETTY MUCH EXPLODES ENOUGH PROBLEMS TO MAKE ME WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM SUPPORTING THIS BILL. TODAY ARE WELL I WOULD HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR. HI BUT WE ASKED HER TO GO BACK WITH A MISSIONARY WORK ON SOME. THAT'S GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS THAT IMPAIR. AND I'M ANSWER THAT WE'RE JUST RUSHED THIS. WITHOUT RE LOOK. IN IT A TOOTH COMB. MEMBER OF SENATE BILL. AND UP. WORK ON SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. WELL MISTER BURGESS YOU WISH TO SPEAK MADAM CHAIR TO A CROSS QUESTION IF I MAY POSE TO THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE REPRESENT ABSOLUTELY. PETER WALK ME THROUGH. WHEN A INSURANCE COMPANY PROPOSES RATES- IN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER REVIEWS THEM. ARE THOSE RATES OF FOUR OR THE BASED ON A SINGLE READ A SINGLE HOUSEHOLD A SINGLE RISK CATEGORY WHAT IS THE PROFILE BY WHICH DETERMINATION MADE BY THE COMMISSIONER. THAT WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE ACCEPTED REJECTED OR GO BACK TO THE DEFAULT RATE PRIOR. SENATOR BORDERS THIS IS BRIAN HANLEY SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE ANSWER IS THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE TO ESTABLISH SEPARATE SHALL NOT BE EXCESSIVE INADEQUATE. OR UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY AND SHALL NOT REMAIN IN EFFECT THAT ARE EXCESSIVE BEYOND THAT IT LEFT TO THE COMMISSIONER IN THE COMMISSIONER ALONE THE POWER TO ADOPT RULES TO THIS TO ESTABLISH WHAT THAT MEANS. THE COMMISSION HAS IN FACT ADOPTED RULES AND IS ADOPTED THE RATE MEETING FORMULA THAT ESTABLISHES CARL RATES ARE DETERMINED AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND WE'RE JUST. THE REYES OF THE INCH. IS WHAT IS FILE WITH THE- IT GOES THROUGH A RATE MAKING. TO DETERMINE THAT THE RATE PROPOSED. IS NOT HIGHER THAN THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED EARNED PREMIUM UNDER A SET FORMULA SO IN SHORT SENATOR. THAT IS AN OVERALL RATE FORMULA LOOKING AT THE STATE ENTIRELY. WITH THAT SAID IN THE REVIEW OF THESE RATE FILINGS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND HIS STAFF DO INDEED LOOK. AT HOW IMPACTS WILL BE ON VARIOUS PARTS OF REGIONS OF THE STATE. THAT TECHNICALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH THE ROLE RATE MAKING FORMULA THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED EARNED. WHICH FOR A CROSS RATE. TO WHAT IT IS THE IN WHAT THE COMMISSION DOES IN REVIEWING THESE FILINGS IS DETERMINED. THAT RATES FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE SO THAT WHERE RATES ARE LOWER FOR SOME PEOPLE SAY IN AN URBAN SETTING. BUT SO FAR IN THE RIPPLE SET. TO BE ON FAIRLY DISK. FOR UNDER. SO THE COMMISSION DOES WERE THOSE. BUT STRICTLY SPEAKING THE EXCESS OF THIS. IN THE FOR. HAS TO DO WITH THE OVERALL STATE RATE. FINAL QUESTION- ARE THERE INSTANCES DURING THAT REVIEW AN EXAMINATION PROCESS THAT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO REJECTING A RATE THAT THE PROVIDE INSURANCE PROVIDER AND THE STAFF OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER REVIEW THESE ARE AT TOGETHER IN SOME FORMAT IN ESSENTIALLY COME OUT WITH THE NEGOTIATED A RATE THAT IS APPROVED BY BOTH SETS OF PARTIES. BETTER IT IS TRUE THAT IN SOME CASES THERE IS THERE IS ALWAYS A DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE COMMISSIONER. THE INSURER AND SOMETIMES THE PUBLIC THAT IS ALWAYS PART OF THE PROCESS WINDOWS PARTIES WISH TO SPEAK AND DISCUSS THE ISSUE IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT THE PARTIES REACH AGREEMENT AND UNDER PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE CURRENTLY. WHEN THAT OCCURRED IF THE COMMISSIONER DETERMINES THAT RATES RIGHT NOW ARE EXCESSIVE. SURE DOES NOT GET TO GO BACK TO THE PRIOR RATES- MUST DEAL WITH THE EXCESSIVE RATES THAT EXIST NOW. THIS PROPOSED BILL HOWEVER THAT WOULD NO LONGER APPLY WITH REGARD TO THE V. TWO ONE SIX SEVEN INDEED THE LANGUAGE IN AB TWO ONE SIX SEVEN EXPRESSLY DISAGREES WITH A SUBSEQUENT BY MAP FILING THE INSURER AUTOMATICALLY GOES BACK TO THE PRIOR RATE. EVEN IF THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THAT PRIOR RATE IS EXCESSIVE. THIS BILL SAYS THE INSURER HAS A RIGHT TO GO BACK TO THAT RATE. THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE CURRENT LAW AND PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF TO MUST MAHER LOCK. THANK YOU IT SURE LOOKS LIKE WE'RE STANDING FOR. BUT TO. IF FINANCIAL. DOES NOT RECEIVE. APPROVAL OF AN ADEQUATE RATE TO. MAKE IT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE TO. PROVIDE A POLICY IN A WILL BE AREA THEN THAT ENSURE HAS THE RIGHT TO. NOT MAKE AN OFFER AT ALL. AND WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND INSURANCE. AND IF THEY CAN'T FIND INSURANCE THEN WE HAVE FAIR. AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THIS IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT VACUUM. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. IF IT WERE ONLY APPROVING 92% OF RATE INCREASES BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING UP BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS OCCURRED THE LAST FEW YEARS. I I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT. NOT APPROVING THIS BILL IS GOING TO PROVIDE. MORE DELAYS IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT INSURERS WANT TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU- ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK UP MR ALL. AND THEN WE'LL GO TO MR DOLL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- TALKING ABOUT SPEAKING ABOUT DELAYS I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AN IDEA. IF THIS BILL HAPPENS TO PASS OFF OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND PASSED THE FLOOR. AND IS SIGNED HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR THE EFFECTS OF THIS BILL TO REACH THE HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN SOMEONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WE'LL GO TO MR DAILIES ON STAFF. GO AHEAD TODAY REFER TO HIS STAFF MR DAILY CAN ANSWER IF HE CHOOSES TO BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION AND NOT OF FIRE AREAS. I'M MORE MORE HOMEOWNERS ARE CHOOSING THE FAIR PLAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER VIABLE OPTION. THIS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON THE GOVERNOR'S SIGNATURE IT REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN EACH HOUSE. AND WE FEEL I FEEL THAT- IT'S AN URGENT ENOUGH MATTER. IT'S HARD TO PASS A BILL LIKE THAT BUT IF WE WANT TO GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY SIR. WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT THROUGH THE AIR I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THERE'S A HUNDRED AND TWO IT A REVIEW THERE'S BOTTLING THAT NEEDS TO BE A SET. YOU HAVE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE ININ THE MIDDLE OF THE POLICY PERIOD AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT POLICY WOULD ALLOW. WOULD REMAIN UNTIL THEIR- BUT- IS HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR THE IMPACTS OF THIS BILL WILL TO REACH. HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS AT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. IS IT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT IS. IS A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAYS BECAUSE WE HAVE A- A NEW LEGISLATIVE SESSION IT STOPS IN JANUARY. THIS IS A VERY. ISSUE I'M JUST. TO UNDERSTAND. THE WHY AND TO MAKE SURE IF WE EXECUTE ON THE WHY THAT BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY OR NOW IN MARCH IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO REACH A HOMEOWNER CAN SOMEONE ANSWER THAT. APOLOGIZE SENATOR I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE EXACT SCHEDULE- THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY FOLLOW TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL OR THAT INSURERS MAY. MAY FOLLOW THERE IS A LOT OF DATA THAT ONLY TO BE GATHERED AND SO FORTH MAY I ASK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT TO. BRIEFLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WHICH IS HOW SOON WILL WE SEE RESULTS. MADAM CHAIR IS ADAMS OKAY ABSOLUTELY MARGARET GETS WITH THE ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE- AS MR DAILY JUST INDICATED IT'S DIFFICULT TO GIVE A PRECISE ANSWER- TO THAT SET QUESTION SENATE ROTH BECAUSE IT'S CONTINGENT ON HOW QUICKLY INSURANCE COMPANIES MAKE OF VIOLENCE AND HOW QUICKLY THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO ACT ON THEM WITH THEIR- LITIGATION WHICH HAS THREATENED I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. THE GONZALEZ BILL THAT WAS MENTIONED BY SENATOR HUESO IS CONTINGENT ON THINGS THAT WOULD TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT SO STONE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS THE BEST PRODUCT PROSPECTS OF EIGHTY THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE MADE THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR GET SOMETHING ON THE STREET TWO WILL. AREA HOME OWNERS THE PAST. THANK YOU- WE HAVE ONE MORE MISTER DOT. I YEP FOLLOWING UP ON OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO'S COMMENTS- I'VE GOT A VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE DIALOGUE NOT THAT- CONTENT OF THE DIALOGUE JUST WE'RE- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE GOING AT. IT IN THIS POLICY AND SO I DID CHECK WITH MY STAFF I REALLY WANTED TO MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR THAT. WE WORKED HARD TO TRY TO GET THIS. THIS JUDICIAL REVIEW PORTION IN HERE BECAUSE WE KEPT HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION. THAT THAT THAT WAS A PROBLEM IT SO I- I JUST I TALKED TO- MY STAFF HERE AND- HE HE SAYS THE OF SENATOR. IT SAYS A DENIAL OF TWENTY AND IT ANY INCREASE IS NOT SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW THAT PUTS THE COMMISSIONER AS THE LAST WAR. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THAT BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU I WAS AGAINST THIS BILL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BECAUSE I SERVE. A HUGE WILDFIRE IS. I'VE BEEN VERY DISSATISFIED ME THE AXE OF THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT NOT SURE INSOFAR BUT THE INSURERS- THE INDUSTRY OF INSURERS ED- SO THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- THE COMMISSIONER. WILL HAVE THE FINAL SAY IT'S SO TO ME THE WAY THAT THIS IS BEING PRESENTED IT'S KIND OF. YELLOW ACTUALLY TAKING THE OTHER SIDE WILL WHY WOULD THE INSURER. WHY WOULD BE IN THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR EXAMPLE BE UPSET IF PEOPLE. WE'RE STILL WAITING TO- US TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- THAT THE- INSURE INSURERS CAN INCREASE THE RATES. INTO OF COURSE HE WOULD BUT THE REALITY IS. THIS PROJECT WAS PUT IN THERE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY I APPRECIATE. SEEING NO MORE INTEREST I WOULD JUST. GO AHEAD MISTER TINA. YES CHAIR I. THE HIGH RISE TO SPEAKER I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE MENTION THAT THE BILL WE GOT OUT OF COMMITTEE WOULD TEND TO GO TO THE FOR- IT ACTUALLY WILL LOOK CREATION SNACKS- IF IT GOES OFF OF FOR TODAY AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS- I APPRECIATE. THE HARD WORK THAT THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR OF DONE- TRYING TO GET AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. RIGHT TEN THROUGH THE PROCESS- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE MOVE FORWARD BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON. SUCH STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD. WE SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF AND ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMISSIONER TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. I THINK THE RATE INCREASE ISSUE IS IMPORTANT. PASSAGE WITH THAT LATER A MEMBER THERE MAY BE. WORKS WITH THE AMENDMENTS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT. THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMISSION. HE WOULD BE LOOKING VERY STRONGLY- AND DISCERNING ON AND FOLLOWING UP ON THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE OF DONE. AND SO I'M GOING TO. SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- WITH THOSE STRONG RESERVATIONS AND NO ONE SHOULD READ INTO- THAT VOTE THAT THE- APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WILL PASS OR NOT PASS THIS BILL WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THOSE ISSUES- WITH A VERY DISCERNING EYE AND ENCOURAGING. THE COMMISSIONER AND THE AUTHOR TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INSURANCE MARKETS ARE STRONG. PEOPLE HAVE A- SCUM GO AND SO. THOSE WILL BE THE CONCERT THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT AND- WITH THAT TO. UNDERSTANDING I'LL PROVIDE A COURTESY VOTE I TODAY BUT JUST WANT TO ASSURE EVERYBODY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT ALL THOSE ISSUES AS IT MOVES FORWARD IF IT MOVES ALL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTER PORTANTINO. I YOU KNOW I KNOW THEY WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND WE HAVE TO- AND GO TO TALK IF I BELIEVE SO. I WILL JUST MAKE THESE LAST COMMENTS. AND SO JUST REALLY QUICK BECAUSE I WANT TO DRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT THEY CAME UP AND I REALLY WANT TO JUST GIVE- SOMETIME FOCUSED ON HARVEY ROSENFIELD BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE WAS ON THE CALL AND THE COMMISSIONER TOOK ALL HIS TIME AND- MY JOB IS TO BE FAIR AND- HE- REALLY ARE MINE. NEEDS TO NOT ONLY BE FAIR BUT- THEY'RE ANTI ONE. FILLED THE LAVELL TO STAY TO SPEAK WITH HIM AND TALK TO HIM AND WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT INSURANCE AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WITHOUT SPEAKING ABOUT HIM HE WAS THE- PROPONENT OF WANT WANT MY PROP ONE OH THREE. AND DIE HE SINGLE HANDEDLY SAY SO MANY CONSUMERS A LOT OF MONEY SO WE NEED TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE AND I KNOW THAT HE'S SUCH A TREMENDOUS JOB HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WANT TO CONTINUE TO HONOR HIS WORK AND HIS IS YET. TO GIVE THEM SOME TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK HE'S DONE HEARING CALIPHS YEAH BUT BASED ON OUR STATION I KNOW THAT WE CAME TO A CONCLUSION AND YOU KNOW MISTER I. CAN FEEL BOTH AGREED THAT ANY HE SHOULD BE FOCUS ON CONSUMER. AND WE ALSO AGREED THAT. WE WANTED HIM SURE THE OUR TUMORS GET A BETTER DEAL AND ALLOW WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT DID CIRCUMVENT PROP ONE OH THREE. AND THAT WE ABSOLUTELY KEEP THE POWER WITHIN THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND SO I WANT TO MAKE A PAYMENT OUT PROVISION THAT SAYS IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REPEAL. WAS WITH CERTAIN THAT THE INDUSTRY MAY NOT AGREE WITH THIS RULING AND THEY WOULD START FIGHTING LOOK TO AND- DINNER. OF THAT PROVISION. TAKE YOUR AB ONE. TO ENSURE A THE COMMISSIONER HAVE THE LAST WORD. THE FINE WORD AND THAT INDUSTRY COME. IN SUE HIM SO BASS. A NOT SUBJECT TO REVIEW MAN. ONCE THE COMMISSION TO MAKE THE LAST STATEMENT HIS LAST RULING. IT IS DONE. THAT INDUSTRY DOESN'T GET TO TAKE THEM BACK TO COURT AND TRY TO CHANGE HIS FOR HIS FILING SO IT'S REALLY MADE. BUT THAT INTENT TO SATISFIED SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HARVEY ROSENFIELD- HAD AND I APPRECIATE OUR DISCUSSIONS. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED HERE BUT I WANTED TO ASSURE EVERYONE THAT IT WAS DONE. WITH THAT THE BEST INTENTIONS TO GIVE THE COMMISSIONER THAT ABSOLUTE- BUT THE ALREADY. AND NUMBER TWO WE ALSO ADDED SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. ABOUT THE- PROP ONE ALL THREE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T CIRCUMVENT THE PROCESS AND I KNOW I. CONCERNED STILL AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD DO. IS THAT I. GOING THANK. BOB THERE THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. TO RETELL TO THE COME BECAUSE THIS SHOW BE. A BILL THAT. EVERYONE A SHOULD BE COLLABORATIVE IT SHOULD PUT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN THE CENTER. AND DOT LAST YEAH I WOULD SAY I KNOW I MAY NOT SEE MICHAEL THEY'RE RELATED BUT I THINK WE HAVE THREE CRISIS IS ON OUR HANDS NUMBER ONE WE DO HAVE COVER NINETEEN. NUMBER TWO WE DO HAVE THE UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ISSUES. BUT WE'RE FORGETTING THE THREE PRONG WHICH IS WORKING HEADING INTO FIRE SEASON. AND WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS SENSE YOU KNOW THE DEVASTATION SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SO THIS DOES BECOME ORIGIN IN THE SENSE THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE SOMETHING IS IN THE WORKS TO HELP THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE UNABLE TO GET INSURANCE IN THE WE AREA. FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN INSURE THEM THIS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE CONSUMERS HAVE OPTIONS THEY'RE NOT DROPPED THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE FAIR PLAN WHICH MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. AND THEREFORE I THINK THAT IT'S EMPTY NOW WE DE. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE IN COMMITTEE. AND I HOPE THAT IS NOT THE FOR. VERSION THAT YOU DO YOU CHAU TO HAMMER ALSO HARVEY REAL. BECAUSE HE IS REALLY AN IMPORT. TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA HE BRINGS- YOU KNOW RAIL REALLY VALID POINTS AND HE'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE- IS THAT ONE PERSON THAT IS ALL OF OUR CONSCIENCE AND I DO APPRECIATE HIM.

SIMILARLY TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE IN SAN DIEGO HOWEVER I'M GOING TO STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY. THIS IS A VERY VERY NEEDY PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE. I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE PRNCIPAL TENET OF WHAT. I UNDERSTOOD THE GOAL TO BE WHICH WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS WHO. WERE NO LONGER BEING PROVIDED COVERAGE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S DIRECTLY ADDRESSED BY. WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE TODAY. BUT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS KIND OF BILL IS PRECISELY WHY WE HAVE TWO CALENDAR YEARS IN THE SESSION. ON JUST LITTLE CONCERNED I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE TIME. TO GET THROUGH. ALL OF THE ISSUES ARE AND I STAND REMAIN CONCERNED. BY A NUMBER OF ISSUES RAISED BY CONSUMERS. AROUND CONSUMER PROTECTION. ISSUES AROUND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. YOU KNOW VOTER APPROVED POWERS. I JUST THINK I AM NOT COMFORTABLE TODAY ON THE VOTING ON THE BILL. GIVEN ITS CURRENT STATE AND GIVEN THE REALITY OF HOW MUCH TIME WE'VE HAD TO REVIEW IT. AND MUCH HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE LEFT ON THE CLOCK FOR THE SESSION. SO FOR THOSE REASONS. I WILL NOT BE VOTING ON THE BILL TODAY. THE YOU SENATOR MITCH AND I'LL LEAVE THE LAST WORDS TO VICE. SENATOR JOHN THANK MA'AM CHARGES FOR BRIEFLY I'M TO I JUST THINK FOR THE- DEBATE THE MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON REGARDING THIS BILL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. GOOD ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP. AS MY COLLEAGUES- THREE OF US. IN THIS COMMITTEE REPRESENT. THE WILD LANDS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY- THIS DOES IMPACT OUR CONSTITUENTS DIRECTLY. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POLICY DEBATE THAT WE'VE HAD HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE CHAIR OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR HIS- VERY WISE COMMENTS EARLIER. AND AS A MEMBER OF APPROPRIATIONS- AGREE WITH HIM AND LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONTINUING THIS DEBATE APPROPRIATIONS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. HERE TO PRESENT A B. THIRTY TWELVE. IN OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TUBBS FIRE CHANGE MY HOMETOWN OF SANTA ROSA FOREVER. THE FIRE DESTROYED FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE STRUCTURES TOOK THE LIVES OF TWENTY TWO PEOPLE NEARLY ALL OF THEM WERE FROM COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. SINCE IN MY STAFF AND I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS WORKING WITH CONSTITUENTS AND THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES. EVEN OUR BEST TO HELP CONSTITUENTS GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. TWO AND A HALF LATER TWO AND A HALF YEARS LATER. YOU CAN SEE THE REBUILDING PROCESS WELL UNDERWAY IN CINEMA COUNTY. I LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN INCLUDING HOW ILL PREPARED WE WERE FOR THIS NEW NORMAL. SO MANY PLANS FOR FIRE TORNADOS OR WILDFIRES THAT BURNED SO FAST AND SO HOT THEY JUMPED EIGHT LANES OF FREEWAY. ENTERING CARS INTO MOLTEN METAL. NOT EVEN INSURANCE COMPANIES PLAN FOR THAT KIND OF DEVASTATION. WE'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH THE AFTERMATH EVERSENSE. AB THIRTY TWELVE IS NOT A SILVER BULLET BUT I THINK IT'S A SERIES OF BALANCE STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE BILL THOSE FIVE THINGS NUMBER ONE IT BUILDS ON THE HOME INSURANCE FINDER THAT MY BILL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO HELP CONNECT HOMEOWNERS WITH COMPANIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE BIG ADVERTISING BUDGETS BUT MAY BE WILLING TO OFFER HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE. FOR OTHERS ARE NOT. NUMBER TWO IT PROHIBITS INSURERS FROM DEDUCTING THE LAND VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IF THE HOMEOWNER CHOOSES TO REBUILD. OR BUY A HOME NEW HOME SOMEWHERE ELSE. IT SAYS THAT IF A HOME IS LOST DURING A DECLARED DISASTER INSURERS MUST OFFER 30% OF THE DWELLING COVERAGE LIMITS UP TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WITH NO ITEM IS ATION LIMIT REQUIRED. REMEMBER IN THESE CASES THE MAJORITIES THESE WERE COMPLETE LOSSES. THAT EXCEEDED. THE VALUE IN MANY CASES UP 260% OF PEOPLE'S. FULL INSURANCE- PULLED HIM OUT OF INSURANCE. THE FOUR THIS REQUIRES INSURERS TO CONTINUE PLAYING PAYING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES IF THE HOME IS REBUILT. BUT NOT YET INHABITABLE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS A WATER SYSTEM THAT MAY THAT IS STILL DOWN THE ELECTRIC GRID THAT HAS NOT BEEN REPLACED. AND FINALLY A. B.
