00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:55.447
AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.

00:26:55.513 --> 00:26:56.481
CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:58.350
AUTHORIZES MUNICIPAL UTILITY

COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS CAN

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.831
INITIALLY PROVIDE THE SERVICE.

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:14.199
BUT HAVE TO SEE OVER THE

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:15.800
AUTHORITY ONCE A PRIVATE ENTITY

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:18.503
IS WILLING TO DEPLOY THE SERVICE.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:19.838
RESTRICTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:27:19.904 --> 00:27:21.573
FROM BUILDING OUT THEIR OWN HIGH

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:22.640
SPEED NETWORKS IS

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:24.409
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO CLOSING

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.611
CALIFORNIA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE.

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:28.246

00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:37.555
ACCESS TO ONE PROVIDER. OR WHERE

00:27:37.622 --> 00:27:39.124
THERE IS A LACK OF ONGOING

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.525
INVESTMENT.

00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:41.626
NOW THE IDEA THAT LOCAL

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:42.927
GOVERNMENTS OUGHT TO PLAY A MORE

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.662
