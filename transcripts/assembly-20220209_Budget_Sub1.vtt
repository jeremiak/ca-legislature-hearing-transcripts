OFTENTIMES THAN URBAN ONES. THE

ADULTS LOSE MOST OR ALL OF THEIR

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.022
VISION IT IS MORE COMMON THAN

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:19.990
NOT THAT THEY VIEW THEIR LIVES

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:21.792
AS ESSENTIALLY OVER IN A

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:25.596
DOWNHILL SPIRAL FROM WHICH THEY

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:26.864
WILL NOT RECOVER. THIS VIEW

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:28.799
CREATE AND NOW OF SYRIA MENTAL

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:31.135
HEALTH CHALLENGES SUCH AS

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:51.756
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. BECAUSE

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:53.257
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE

00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:55.559
FUNDING FOR THESE SERVICES IS

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:58.162

OR NEIGHBORHOOD IT IS AMAZING

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:08.105
HOW USING A CANE OR GUIDE DOG

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.741

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:12.877

TECHNOLOGY TRAINING SO THEY CAN

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:22.019
USE SMARTPHONES AND COMPUTERS.

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:12.709
HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO ISSUES

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.210

LANGUAGE. SO THE FIRST IS THAT

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.419
THE ONE TO FORTY CASELOAD RATIO

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:26.422

GIVEN TO YOU AT THAT APARTMENT

IS. QUARTERLY REVIEWS OF THE

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.442
CHILD'S INDIVIDUALIZED FAMILY

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:48.745
SERVICE PLAN. WE WERE WONDERING

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:51.514
IF ANY OF THE OTHER- THE SORT OF

ACTIVITIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:54.083

TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF SUPPORT. ON

THE ISSUE OF REGIONAL CENTER

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:16.672
IDEA'S SPECIALISTS- WE DO

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:18.007
UNDERSTAND THAT THESE

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:20.777
SPECIALISTS WOULD NOT BE- HAVING

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.912
CASELOAD OF THEIR OWN BUT WOULD

WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.295
SCHOOLS IN THE AREA. AND OUR

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.697
QUESTION I GUESS IS REALLY

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.633
WHETHER SOME OF THE REGIONAL

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:46.736
CENTERS. THAT HAVE- A LOT MORE

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:49.439
CHILDREN IN THIS AGE AS WELL AS

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:51.007
A LOT MORE SCHOOLS IN THEIR

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:54.310
CATCHMENT AREA. IF IF ONE A

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.813
SPECIALIST IS REALLY SUFFICIENT

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.648
TO SORT OF PROVIDE THE SUPPORT

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:00.750
TO THE SERVICE COORDINATORS AND

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.051
WORK WITH THE SCHOOLS IN THAT

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.253
AREA. WE'RE JUST NOT NOT SURE

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.355
THAT THAT ONE. WHY IT'S

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:10.226
NECESSARILY ONE SPECIALIST PER

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.527
REGIONAL CENTER. IN THEN WHEN IT

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.229
COMES. THE PRESCHOOL INCLUSION

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:15.498
PROPOSAL WE THINK THE INTENT OF

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.899
THIS PROPOSAL MAKES A LOT OF

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:19.502
SENSE BUT RIGHT NOW THE PROPOSAL

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.038
IS JUST NOT VERY REFINED. SO FOR

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:24.607
EXAMPLE- APART FROM THE

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.476

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.710

STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THERE ARE

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.714
THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF DETAILS

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.850
ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD BE

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:34.417
IMPLEMENTED- WE DON'T KNOW

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.953
EXACTLY HOW THE PARTICULAR

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.222
PRESCHOOLS WOULD BE IDENTIFIED

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:41.057
OR WHAT TYPES OF SUPPORT. THEY

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.159
WOULD NEED SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:45.027
STAFF MIGHT NEED MORE TRAINING

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:47.029
THEY MIGHT NEED MORE ADAPTIVE

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.264
EQUIPMENT OR THEIR BUILDINGS WE

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.932
NEED TO CHANGES TO MAKE THEM

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.968
MORE ACCESSIBLE- WE DON'T KNOW

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.069
IF THEY WOULD ACTUALLY NEED

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.671
EXTRA STAFFING OR IF IT WOULD

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:58.074
SIMPLY- IF THEY'D SIMPLY NEED TO

01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.876
ALLOW CHILDREN TO BRING. IN

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.477

MILLION DOLLARS IS BASED ON AND

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:27.904
WHAT WHAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY-

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.071
GET THE STATE IN TERMS OF HOW

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.840

HERE IS A FEW THINGS THAT WE

01:27:51.466 --> 01:27:52.900
LEARNED. WHAT WE LEARNED WAS

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:53.968
THAT SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT WORKS

TIME I LOST A LOT OF MONEY IN

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:00.942
THOSE HERE'S- WHAT WE LEARNED IS

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:02.510
THAT YOU HAVE TO INVEST IN JOB

DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE BUT A

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:07.715

A STRONG ENOUGH FUNDING SOURCE-

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:11.919

ACTUALLY MOVES THE NEEDLE MOVES

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.092
THE NEEDLE AND MAKES A

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.727
DIFFERENCE. IS PAID JOB

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.629
DEVELOPERS WHO CAN BOTH

UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE WE SERVE.

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:26.567
AND ALSO SPEAK TO THE BUSINESS

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:28.069
INTERESTS OF EMPLOYERS. WHAT WE

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.570
LEARNED IS THAT JOB COACHES HAVE

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.172
TO BE WELL TRAINED THEY HAVE TO

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:32.974
BE PERSON CENTERED AND ABLE TO

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.276
WORK VERY INDEPENDENTLY. AND

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:36.878
WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT PERSON

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:40.415
CENTERED- PROCESS OF DISCOVERY.

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:41.983
OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING EACH

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:44.519
INDIVIDUAL'S SKILLS CHALLENGES

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:46.521
AND CAREER ASPIRATIONS IS

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:49.057
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THIS WHOLE

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:50.658
TRANSITION PROCESS HAS TO BE

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:53.061

SEVERAL YEARS. I KNOW THAT WE

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:00.001

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.508
MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT TAKES

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:09.744
MUCH LONGER. FIVE YEARS WOLD BE

WIDE TRANSITION SEVEN YEARS WAS

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.850
MORE REALISTIC I BELIEVE. STATES

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.019
LIKE OREGON AND MASSACHUSETTS

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:20.188

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.692

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:43.044

REALLY EFFECTIVE JOB COACHING.

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:05.700
THAT COACHING FADES OVER TIME SO

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.869

LOOKING AT THAT AS A TARGET BUT

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:20.414
REALLY MY QUESTION IS WHAT YOU

01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:21.916
KNOW WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:24.085
OUR IT D. POPULATION THAT. WAS

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:26.454
WORKING. ON THAT THIS IS

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.289
AFFECTING TO HAVE A NUMBER ON

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:29.223
THAT BECAUSE OUT WHAT WHAT I'M

01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:31.392
HEARING BACK IS THAT IT'S ABOUT

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:33.861
FOURTEEN PERCENT. ON SO WHAT IS

01:35:33.928 --> 01:35:36.063
THAT NUMBER DO WE HAVE THAT FROM

01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.598
THE DEPARTMENT- AND WHAT IS THAT

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:40.701
LOOK LIKE AND I'LL START THERE.

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:44.605
THE CORRECT APARTMENT YES THANK

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:47.241
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS- WHEN

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:48.876
WE HAVE THE NUMBER AND I DON'T

01:35:48.943 --> 01:35:51.312
APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE- ALL THAT

01:35:51.378 --> 01:35:54.181
THAT THE DATA IN FRONT OF ME BUT

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:55.549
WE CAN- PROVIDE IT- HE ESTIMATE

01:35:55.616 --> 01:35:56.951
WAS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

01:35:57.017 --> 01:35:58.586
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:00.121
ACTIVE IN WORKING TIVITY

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:02.523
PROGRAMS- AND THEN ALSO AN

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.992
ASSUMPTION OF SOME INDIVIDUALS

01:36:05.059 --> 01:36:07.094
WHO WOULD BE LEAVING- HIGH

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:11.465
SCHOOL AND OPTING FOR THIS AS AN

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:12.266
OPTION. AS COMPARED TO OTHER

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:14.602
SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- SO

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:16.504
WITH THE PILOT IT REALLY HAS

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:21.041
BEEN FOCUSED ON A SPECIFIED-

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:23.811
GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE-

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:25.312
PARTICIPATING IN WORK ACTIVITY

01:36:25.379 --> 01:36:26.914
PROGRAMS. SO IT IS A SMALL

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:28.916
PERCENTAGE- WE HAVE SEEN A

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:30.784
SIGNIFICANT RIGHT AND WORK

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:32.620
ACTIVITY PROGRAM PARTICIPATION

01:36:32.686 --> 01:36:35.890
OVER THE YEARS- SO THAT NUMBER.

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.192
WHERE'S MAYBE THREE FOUR FIVE

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:39.026
YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:41.395
DOUBLED- IT HAS DEFINITELY.

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:43.097
DECREASED OVER TIME. SO THERE'S

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:45.266
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WILL

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:46.233
BE HELPFUL WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.835
IT. OKAY BECAUSE THE THOSE ARE

01:36:47.902 --> 01:36:49.470
NUMBERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:50.337
IMPORTANT AND ALSO YOU KNOW WITH

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:51.372
THE DECREASE WE ALL KNOW THE

01:36:51.438 --> 01:36:52.840
LAST COUPLE YEARS THERE'S BEEN A

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:55.309
HUGE DECREASE IN EMPLOYMENT

01:36:55.376 --> 01:37:00.281
PERIOD DUE TO THE- EPIDEMIC- BUT

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:01.248
WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA NEED THAT

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:02.249
BREAK DOWN WITHIN THE

01:37:02.316 --> 01:37:04.585
POPULATION. NO BECAUSE WE WILL

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.420
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT. THE

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:08.889
FEDERAL OUR STANDARDS ARE FOR

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:10.524
SUB PAY VERSUS WHAT WE JUST

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:13.460
PASSED RECENTLY. IN THE OVERLAPS

01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:16.897
THERE IT'S VERY CONCERNING- TO

01:37:16.964 --> 01:37:18.365
HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

01:37:18.432 --> 01:37:20.234
WORKING WHO HAD THE DIGNITY OF

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.036
BEING ABLE TO MAKE A PAYCHECK.

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:26.040
IN NOW- ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO DO

01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:27.841
THAT. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.376
WE'RE NOT LETTING ANYBODY SLIDE

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:33.714
IN ANY GAPS IN IN CREATING- THE

01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:35.849
A PLACE WHERE SOMEBODY DID HAVE

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:38.986
THE ABILITY TO WORK. IN NOW DUE

01:37:39.053 --> 01:37:40.421
TO SOMETHING WE CHANGES

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:43.691
LEGISLATURE ERRORS. ARE FALLING

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:45.859
THROUGH THE CRACKS AND LOOSE

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:49.597
THAT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:37:49.663 --> 01:37:52.600
RUBIO. THANK YOU I'M WHEN THIS

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:54.835
BILL CAME US- ON THE FLOOR LST

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:57.271
YEAR ONE OF MY CONCERNS THAT WE

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:59.006
ARE EXPERT OR AT LEAST I EXPRESS

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.275
WAS THEM THE ABILITY FOR SOME OF

01:38:01.342 --> 01:38:02.509
THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:04.545
THE LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT AND TO

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:07.147
MISTER MATHIS IS- QUESTION DO WE

01:38:07.214 --> 01:38:09.116
HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:11.852
ARE EMPLOYED CURRENTLY- OR WHAT

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:13.354
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS FOR

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:16.257
THAT POPULATION SO THAT'S ONE

01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:18.525
AND NUMBER TWO- MY FEAR WAS AND

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:19.693
I DON'T KNOW THIS AND THIS IS A

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.495
QUESTION. MY FEAR WAS THAT A LOT

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:22.596
OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS WERE

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:24.431
GOING TO PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:38:24.498 --> 01:38:25.766
BUT THEN THE HOURS AGO THEY ARE

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.401
GOING TO BE CUT WHICH EALLY

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.737
DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE- IN

01:38:29.803 --> 01:38:31.905
TERMS OF MORE INCOME FOR THAT

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:34.508
INDIVIDUAL- TWO COULD WE HAVE

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:36.143
DATA ON THAT AS WELL AS THE HOW

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:37.611
MANY PEOPLE HAVE TRANSITIONED.

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:43.917
INTO MORE PAY BUT LESS WORK. OR

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:47.821
HOURS OF WORK. THANK YOU.

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:50.057
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO- I HATE IT

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:54.128
IS. VERY CONCERNING AS- YOUR

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:55.929
HEARING AND OTHERS HAVESHARED

01:38:55.996 --> 01:38:57.698
ABOUT THE DECREASE AND

01:38:57.765 --> 01:38:59.233
COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.869
EMPLOYMENT WITH PAID JOBS. I'M

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:03.971
IT HAS DEFINITELY DECREASED- AS

01:39:04.038 --> 01:39:05.873
A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC IN

01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:09.176
ADDITION TO THE- COMPETITIVE

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:12.479
WAGES WE ALSO SAW A SIGNIFICANT

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:14.448
DECREASE AND PART OF THIS IS

01:39:14.515 --> 01:39:16.450
THAT A TOTAL WEEK WE STILL HAVE

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:17.318
TO KIND OF DRILL INTO SOME OF

01:39:17.384 --> 01:39:19.586
THE DATA. IS THAT WHEN WE TAKE A

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:21.288
LOOK AT OUR DATA FOR THOSE

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:23.857
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE- INCOME

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:27.328
PAID- PAID JOBS. THE NUMBER OF

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:29.630
INDIVIDUALS HAS GONE DOWN. BUT

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:31.899
THE AVERAGE WAGE HAS GONE UP.

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:34.201
AND WHILE WITHOUT KIND OF

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:35.936
DRILLING INTO IT SOME OF THAT

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:37.938
ASSUMPTION IS THAT. THOSE THAT

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.707
WERE WITHIN EVEN SUB MINIMUM

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:42.676
WAGE OVER THE PANDEMIC LIKE

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:45.312
LIKELY HAD LOST SOME OF THOSE

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:48.782
OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE DO WALDRON

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:51.051
INCIDENTS THAT WERE WORKING ON

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:52.553

01:40:58.652 --> 01:41:01.155
THE BILL WAS THAT YOU KNOW IF

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:02.556
WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION AND

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:04.191
YES WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT THESE

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.125
ORGANIZATIONS WITHOUT MONEY NOW

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.093
BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.995
AFTERWARDS. IN ARE WE GOING TO

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.363
YOU KNOW PRETEND THAT IT DOESN'T

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.198
EXIST AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:13.100
THOSE FOLKS. YES THEY NEED

01:41:13.167 --> 01:41:14.067
OBVIOUSLY THEY WANTED TO WORK

01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:15.836
BUT THE PRIDE THAT I SAW IN

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:17.204
THEIR FACES JUST THE FACT THAT

01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:18.972
THEY WERE AT WORK EVERY DAY THAT

01:41:19.039 --> 01:41:21.742
HELPS WITH SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL-

01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:23.477
WELL BEING BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE

01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:25.979
AN A PURPOSE RIGHT. TO WEAR

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:27.448
WHERE THEY'RE GETTING UP EVERY

YOU HAVE THEM AND AS ACCURATELY

01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:45.799

01:41:55.342 --> 01:41:56.743
WE NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:57.644
IMMEDIATELY THEN. THAT NEEDS TO

01:41:57.711 --> 01:42:00.481
BE TOLD TO US SO THAT WE CAN DO

01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:01.281
YOU KNOW REMEDY THE SITUATION

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:03.183

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:04.918
BE GEAT AS WELL IF IT'S WORKING

LAST COUPLE YEARS. BUT AGREED

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:05.812
THE NEED FOR DATA IS IMPORTANT

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.481
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFITS THAT

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:10.584
THE DATA IS NOT QUITE EXACT-

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:12.386
BACK TO YOU KNOW YOU'RE WE'RE

01:43:12.452 --> 01:43:13.453
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.055
REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO EVEN

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:16.557
GOING WITH THE DIRECT WE WENT ON

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:17.391
A GREAT TORE DOWN THE COSTA

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:18.825
MESA. WITH THROUGH A LOT OF

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:20.594
THESE PROGRAM SAW A LOT OF

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:21.094
REALLY GOOD THINGS ARE

01:43:21.161 --> 01:43:23.463
HAPPENING- BEFORE THE RECENT

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:26.133
LEGISLATION. AND YOU KNOW I I'VE

01:43:26.199 --> 01:43:29.102
GOT TO ASK YOU KNOW WE CANNOT

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:31.071
IMPROVE THESE NUMBERS. WHAT IS

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:33.040
THE FALLBACK PLAN. WHAT ARE WE

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:34.174
DOING TO ENSURE THAT THIS

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:36.009
POPULATION IS VERY VERY FRAGILE

01:43:36.076 --> 01:43:38.011
POPULATION AGAIN IS NOT GOING TO

01:43:38.078 --> 01:43:40.314
FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. BECAUSE

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.149
SOMETIMES LEGISLATION IS NOT THE

01:43:42.215 --> 01:43:44.885
BEST. SOMETIMES YOU KNOW WE MOVE

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:46.086
FORWARD AND THEN WE GOT TO TAKE

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:49.122
TWO STEPS BACK SO I WANT TO MAKE

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:50.257
SURE IT IS WE'RE GOING THROUGH

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:51.992
THIS- ALL THINGS ARE BEING

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:54.194
CONSIDERED BECAUSE WE CAN'T RUSH

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:56.430
INTO THIS AND EXPECT THE

01:43:56.496 --> 01:43:57.698
ECONOMIC SECTOR YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:43:57.764 --> 01:43:58.765
SUPPOSED TO DO SOCIAL COVERS

01:43:58.832 --> 01:44:01.201
POSSIBILITIES YES BOY THROUGH

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:02.302
THE PANDEMIC THROUGH EVERYTHING

01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:04.738
ELSE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:06.807
THIS POPULATION ISN'T BEING. IT

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:08.775
IS IN A LOSE OUT. BECAUSE OF

01:44:08.842 --> 01:44:11.878
GOOD INTENTIONS. I'D LIKE TO ADD

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:13.714

FOR THE STATE COUNCIL. I BELIEVE

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:19.987
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US THAT

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:22.489
FAIL SAFE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT.

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:24.358
THOSE WHO CURRENTLY ARE EMPLOYED

01:44:24.424 --> 01:44:26.259
THROUGH THE WORK ACTIVITY

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:28.028
PROGRAMS OR OTHER SETTINGS. YOU

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.596
WILL NOT LOSE EMPLOYMENT

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:31.298
ALTOGETHER THROUGH THE PENDING

01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:34.134

TO HEAR WHAT THE PLANNING IS

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:41.041
AROUND THIS AND WHAT CAN BE DONE

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.643
TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE POSITIVE

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:44.544

LESSONS FROM OTHER STATES WHO

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:44.691
HAVE MADE THIS TRANSITION AND

01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:46.193

02:10:13.238 --> 02:10:16.041
INDIVIDUALS. CAN BE SUPPORTED BY

02:10:16.108 --> 02:10:18.677
A QUALITY WORKFORCE THAT IS

02:10:18.744 --> 02:10:20.946
PROVIDING SERVICES TO THEM. THEN

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:22.548
PERHAPS HAVING A QUALITY

02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:24.650
WORKFORCE IS A MEASURE THAT

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:26.485
SUPPORTS QUALITY OUTCOMES. WE

02:10:26.552 --> 02:10:27.653
COULD NOT FIND A QUALITY

02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:29.655
WORKFORCE AS AN ADEQUATE AND

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:31.323
STABLE SUPPLY OF PEOPLE

02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:32.991
APPROPRIATELY TRAINED TO MEET

02:10:33.058 --> 02:10:34.593
THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY.

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.061
YOU'RE NOT ALONE KRISPYKREME

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:38.130
CULTURALLY COMPETENT MANNER THAT

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:40.232
RESPECTS INDIVIDUAL CHOICES AND

02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:42.000
IS GEARED TO ACHIEVE. OUR

02:10:42.067 --> 02:10:44.903
DESIRED PERSON CENTERED OUTCOMES

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:46.371
SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:10:46.438 --> 02:10:47.372
MOUTHFUL BUT IT'S A TASTE OF HOW

02:10:47.439 --> 02:10:51.677
COMPLEX THE DEFINITION MIGHT BE

02:10:51.743 --> 02:10:53.745
. ARM AND THEN. A QUALITY WORK

02:10:53.812 --> 02:10:55.247
NONE COULD AN EXAM OF A LONG

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:58.850
TERM QUALITY OUTCOME MEASURE. TO

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:00.185
KNOW WHETHER WE'RE SUSTAINING A

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:02.120
QUALITY WORKFORCE REQUIRES MUCH

02:11:02.187 --> 02:11:03.155
MORE INFORMATION THAN WE HAVE

02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:05.457
TODAY AND THEN TRACKING THAT

02:11:05.524 --> 02:11:07.793
INFORMATION OVER. FOR EXAMPLE IN

02:11:07.859 --> 02:11:09.461
YEAR ONE WE MIGHT SURVEYS

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:11.763
SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE FIRST

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:13.198

02:11:13.265 --> 02:11:14.833
INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF

02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:16.468
EMPLOYEES THAT THEY HAVE

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:18.270
PROVIDING SERVICES. THEIR

02:11:23.041 --> 02:11:25.244
TENURE OR TURNOVER RATES. NEAR

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:27.079
TO DO WE MIGHT BUILD ON NOT BY

02:11:27.145 --> 02:11:29.081
COLLECTING THE SAME INFORMATION

02:11:29.147 --> 02:11:30.415
AND THEN ANALYZING WHETHER

02:11:30.482 --> 02:11:32.150
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING

02:11:32.217 --> 02:11:33.785
AND WORKFORCE TRAINING AND RATE

02:11:33.852 --> 02:11:35.921
ADJUSTMENTS ARE HAVING THEIR

02:11:35.988 --> 02:11:37.656
INTENDED IN. WE MIGHT ALSO BEGIN

02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:38.624
TO COLLECT THIRD PARTY

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:40.492

COMPETENCY THAT THEY'RE

02:11:48.634 --> 02:11:51.436
EXPERIENCING. IN YEAR THREE WE

02:11:51.503 --> 02:11:53.538
MIGHT CONTINUE THOSE SURVEYS AND

02:11:53.605 --> 02:11:55.173
ALSO BEGIN TO INCREASE THE

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:56.708
WEIGHT GIVEN TO THE THIRD PARTY

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:58.777
INFORMATION- FROM THE

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:01.880
INDIVIDUALS BEING SERVED AS- THE

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:04.049
GOAL ULTIMATELY IS INDIVIDUAL

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:06.251
PERSON CENTRED QUALITY OUTCOME

02:12:06.318 --> 02:12:09.121
MEASURES. THE PROGRAM ALONG THE

02:12:09.187 --> 02:12:11.423
WAY WOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL

02:12:11.490 --> 02:12:13.659
INCENTIVES WELL PERHAPS SIMPLY

02:12:13.725 --> 02:12:15.160
INITIALLY JUST FOR PROVIDING

02:12:15.227 --> 02:12:17.529
THAT DATA THAT FOUNDATIONAL DATA

02:12:17.596 --> 02:12:19.665
WE WOULD NEED TO BE CONSTRUCTED

02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:21.533
MEASURE AND KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.834
AND THEN INCREASINGLY FOR

02:12:22.901 --> 02:12:25.270
PERFORMING AT OR ABOVE BENCHMARK

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:27.773
LEVELS ON THE MEASURE FOR MAKING

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:29.508
MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARD THE

02:12:29.574 --> 02:12:31.610
BENCHMARK. WHICH COULD BE FOR

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:33.545
EXAMPLE AND IN THIS CASE REDUCE

02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:35.947
TURNOVER CERTAIN LEVELS OF

02:12:36.014 --> 02:12:39.084
TRAINING AND CERTAIN TOPICS THAT

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.352
ARE VALIDATED AS PRACTICED. AND

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:41.887
OUR WORKFORCE COMPOSITION

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:43.622
DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE MORE

02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:45.090
CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:47.359
COMMUNITY BEING SERVED. SO I'M

02:12:47.426 --> 02:12:48.193
GONNA WORK KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:49.328
THESE MEASURES ARE STILL BEING

02:12:49.394 --> 02:12:51.096
DEVELOPED EVEN THIS EXAMPLES AND

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:52.698
IN PERFECT AND HYPOTHETICAL

02:12:52.764 --> 02:12:55.067
EXAMPLE BUT STILL LACKS SOME

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:57.569
DETAILS- WE'RE REALLY

02:12:57.636 --> 02:12:59.338
APPRECIATIVE OF THE ENGAGEMENT

02:12:59.404 --> 02:13:00.872
THAT TIME AND THE EXPERTISE OF

02:13:00.939 --> 02:13:02.808
OUR SYSTEMS INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES

02:13:02.874 --> 02:13:05.644
AND- STICK TO STAKEHOLDERS AND

02:13:05.711 --> 02:13:07.112
REGIONAL CENTERS AND SERVICE

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:09.348
PROVIDERS. AND WE EXPECT THAT IN

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:11.550
GAUGE MEANT TO CONTINUE WELL

02:13:11.616 --> 02:13:13.151
INTO THE FUTURE AS THIS PROGRAM

02:13:13.218 --> 02:13:17.456
CONTINUES TO BE- INTO TO INVOLVE

02:13:17.522 --> 02:13:18.990
. WE WANT TO REMIND THAT ANY

02:13:19.057 --> 02:13:20.659
MEASURES THAT WE ULTIMATELY

02:13:20.726 --> 02:13:21.993
DECIDE UPON THAT THEIR

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:24.229
MEANINGFUL BUT THERE ARE VALID

02:13:24.296 --> 02:13:25.464
AND RELIABLE. THAT THERE

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:28.700
FEASIBLE TO COLLECT. ON THE DAY

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:30.102
WE'RE NOT CREATING PERVERSE ARE

02:13:30.168 --> 02:13:32.871
CONTRADICTORY IMPACTS AND THINGS

02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:35.140
LIKE THAT. YOU HEARD IN THIS

02:13:35.207 --> 02:13:36.942
EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE AREAS OF

02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:38.243
WHICH TODAY WE LACK THE DATA OR

02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:40.245
PROCESS INFRASTRUCTURE TO

02:13:40.312 --> 02:13:42.080
CALCULATE A MEASURE ON DAY ONE

02:13:42.147 --> 02:13:43.115
AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:45.484
SYNERGIES WITH OTHER INITIATIVES

02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:46.451
FROM REGIONAL CENTER PERFORMANCE

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:48.387
MEASURES TO THE NEW CASE

02:13:48.453 --> 02:13:50.722
MANAGEMENT OR OR THE NEW HAND OR

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:52.724

WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:56.228
BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL COME

02:13:56.294 --> 02:13:58.029
TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE AND THAT

02:13:58.096 --> 02:14:00.232
MEASURE QUALITY PERSON CENTRED

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:03.435
OUTCOMES AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL

02:14:03.502 --> 02:14:04.936
AT THE ULTIMATE ON. I'M STILL A

02:14:05.003 --> 02:14:06.338
LITTLE OF A MOUTHFUL BUT

02:14:06.405 --> 02:14:09.775
HOPEFULLY FOR EXAMPLE. THANK YOU

02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:11.376

02:14:31.963 --> 02:14:35.066
SAY IS- THE RATE. RATE STEADY

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:36.701
IMPROVEMENT TO THE RATE REFORM

02:14:36.768 --> 02:14:38.336
QUALITY INCENTIVE PROGRAM

02:14:38.403 --> 02:14:40.238
REPRESENTS SUCH A HUGE CHANGE IN

02:14:40.305 --> 02:14:42.374
THE SYSTEM IT'S A- POSITIVE STEP

02:14:42.441 --> 02:14:44.176
TOWARD A MORE RATIONAL AND

02:14:44.242 --> 02:14:45.944
TRANSPARENT SYSTEM FOR PAYING.

02:14:46.011 --> 02:14:47.579
THE MANY PROVIDERS SERVING

02:14:47.646 --> 02:14:50.148
INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEM AND WE

02:14:50.215 --> 02:14:53.185
REALLY HAD TO BIG- QUESTIONS

02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:55.520
ABOUT THIS PROCESS- GOING GOING

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:58.557
INTO THIS- BUDGET CYCLE. SO THE

02:14:58.623 --> 02:15:01.193
FIRST WAS HELL WILL BE HAS MAKE

02:15:01.259 --> 02:15:03.628
IT HEARD OF IMPROVEMENTS TO THE

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:06.264
SYSTEM. AND OUR OUR

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:07.499
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:10.068
DEPARTMENT- REALLY STARTED TO

02:15:10.135 --> 02:15:11.703
ADDRESS THIS TODAY WHICH WAS WAS

02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:14.105
GREAT TO HEAR- AND I WOULD JUST

02:15:14.172 --> 02:15:15.674
UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:17.242
HAVING A TRANSPARENT SORT OF

02:15:17.309 --> 02:15:19.311
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS I

02:15:19.377 --> 02:15:21.379
MEAN IT'S BETTER TO SORT OF. IF

02:15:21.446 --> 02:15:22.881
THERE'S ISSUES THAT WE CAN

02:15:22.948 --> 02:15:24.382
IDENTIFY NOW THAT NEED TO BE

02:15:24.449 --> 02:15:26.017
FIXED IT'S BETTER TO FIX THEM

02:15:26.084 --> 02:15:27.219
NOW AND THEN TO YOU KNOW

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:29.754
IMPLEMENTED- A RATE SETTING

02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:31.923
PROCESS THAT- MAY BE WITH US FOR

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:35.260
SOME TIME- SO JUST TO GIVE AN

02:15:35.327 --> 02:15:36.928
EXAMPLE- THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS

02:15:36.995 --> 02:15:38.597
REACHED LAST YEAR INCLUDED THE-

02:15:38.663 --> 02:15:40.198
THE PLAN TO PHASE IN RATE

02:15:40.265 --> 02:15:42.267
INCREASES OVER FIVE YEARS. AND

02:15:42.334 --> 02:15:43.969
THESE RATE INCREASES ARE BASED

02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:45.904
ON WHAT THE RATE MODEL SAY RATES

02:15:45.971 --> 02:15:48.840
SHOULD BE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY

02:15:48.907 --> 02:15:50.509
TWO MISTER NIGHT- INDICATED THAT

02:15:50.575 --> 02:15:55.514
THOSE THE ACTUAL. AMOUNTS WILL

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:56.381
BE AVAILABLE SOON. SO THIS THAT

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:59.251
IN FIVE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY

02:15:59.317 --> 02:16:02.287
FIVE TWENTY SIX- THE TWENTY ONE

02:16:02.354 --> 02:16:03.655
TWENTY TWO LEVEL RATES WILL BE

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:06.258
FULLY PHASED IN- MEANING THEY'RE

02:16:06.324 --> 02:16:10.028
SORT OF. RT DATE- SO ONE BENEFIT

02:16:10.095 --> 02:16:11.730
OF THE RATE MODELS IS THAT THEY

02:16:11.796 --> 02:16:14.666
CAN BE UPDATED WITH- REGULARITY

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:16.434
AND WITH SOME AMOUNT AND HE'S

02:16:16.501 --> 02:16:18.069
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THE INPUTS

02:16:18.136 --> 02:16:21.139
ARE INTO THOSE THREE MODELS. SO

02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:23.408
YOU KNOW QUESTION IN OUR OF MY

02:16:23.475 --> 02:16:25.443
INTO THEN IS HOW DOES THE

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.145
DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO APPROACH

02:16:27.212 --> 02:16:30.882
UPDATING RATES AFTER TWENTY FIVE

02:16:30.949 --> 02:16:32.150
TWENTY SIX- ANOTHER. WHICH

02:16:32.217 --> 02:16:33.785
MISTER KNIGHT ALSO ALLUDED TO

02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:35.754
IT'S JUST THAT RATE MODELS WERE

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:37.822
DEVELOPED PRIOR TO THE COVERED

02:16:37.889 --> 02:16:38.957
NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THERE MAY

02:16:39.024 --> 02:16:40.892
BE SOME LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:42.394
PANDEMIC EXPERIENCE THAT SHOULD

02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:44.296
BE INCORPORATED. INTO THE RATE

02:16:44.362 --> 02:16:47.465
SETTING PROCESS SO AGAIN WE JUST

02:16:47.532 --> 02:16:48.767
UNDERSCORE THAT IT WOULD BE SORT

02:16:48.833 --> 02:16:51.536
OF BETTER TO YOU- FREE VISIT YOU

02:16:51.603 --> 02:16:52.704

ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO

02:16:54.205 --> 02:16:55.840
INTO THE RATE MODELS OR ABOUT

02:16:55.907 --> 02:16:57.976
SERVICE DESIGN ANSWERED. BETTER

02:16:58.043 --> 02:17:01.479
TO ADDRESS THOSE NOW- YOU KNOW

02:17:01.546 --> 02:17:02.547
BEFORE BEFORE THE REMOTE OR

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:05.417
SOMETHING. IN PLACE AND OFTEN

02:17:05.483 --> 02:17:08.553
READING. I'M BILL THE OTHER MAIN

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:10.956
QUESTION THAT WE HAD AND MISTER

A MOMENT AGO CONCERNS- DDS IS

02:17:16.795 --> 02:17:19.364
BIG I. T. SYSTEMS AND- BUSINESS

02:17:19.431 --> 02:17:20.999
SORT OF THE PERENNIAL COMMENT

02:17:21.066 --> 02:17:22.167
THAT THE L. A- MAKES IT BUDGET

02:17:22.233 --> 02:17:24.002
HEARINGS ABOUT DDS IS I. T.

THIS YEAR THAT DDS IS RECEIVING

02:17:29.207 --> 02:17:31.076
PLANNING DOLLARS FROM THE

FEDERAL EACH CBS FUNDS TO

02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:33.778
OVERHAUL TWO OF IT'S REALLY

02:24:06.671 --> 02:24:08.239
FAMILY MEMBERS. I AM ALSO THE

02:24:08.306 --> 02:24:09.974
PARENT OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:11.509
SON WITH AUTISM WHO SERVED BY

02:24:11.576 --> 02:24:13.411
REGIONAL CENTER. I AM HERE TO

PRESENT THE SOUTH AFRICAN FAMILY

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:17.048
PERSPECTIVE ON THE SUBJECT. TO

02:24:17.115 --> 02:24:18.449
BE HONEST MOST PEOPLE WITH

02:24:18.516 --> 02:24:21.219
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND

02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:22.320
THEIR FAMILIES LIVE DAY TO DAY.

02:24:22.387 --> 02:24:24.722
AND NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THE RATE

02:24:24.789 --> 02:24:26.591
SETTING. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT

02:24:26.657 --> 02:24:28.126
MANY OF US HAVE TO FIGHT TO

02:24:28.192 --> 02:24:29.927
RECEIVE SERVICES AND GOOD

02:24:29.994 --> 02:24:32.397
PROVIDERS SO THE IDEA OF RATES

02:24:32.463 --> 02:24:34.532
IS NOT EVEN ON OUR RADAR. HERE'S

02:24:34.599 --> 02:24:36.834
WHAT WE DO CARE ACT WE WANT TO

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:38.102
HAVE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO ARE

02:24:38.169 --> 02:24:40.505

AMAZING PROVIDERS OUT THERE WHO

02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:47.945
HAVE THOSE QUALITIES. WHEN I

02:24:48.012 --> 02:24:49.313
SPEAK TO OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:50.515
THIS ISSUE THEY ARE OFTEN

02:24:50.581 --> 02:24:53.451
SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT RATES ARE

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:55.119
NOT TIED TO OUTCOMES. DOESN'T IT

02:24:55.186 --> 02:24:57.221
JUST MAKES SENSE TO PAY HIGHER

02:24:57.288 --> 02:24:59.857
RATES TO THE PROVIDERS TO DO

02:24:59.924 --> 02:25:01.125
BETTER FOR THEIR CLIENTS. THE

02:25:01.192 --> 02:25:02.894
REGIONAL CENTER THE SAME RETOOL

DIGNITY AND RESPECT AS THE YEAR

02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:09.500
TO A PROVIDER THAT ABUSE. WHY IS

02:25:09.567 --> 02:25:11.169
THE RATE THE SAME FOR PROVIDER

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:12.637
THAT HELPS US ACHIEVE OUR PERSON

02:25:12.703 --> 02:25:14.872
CENTRED INCLUSIVE OUTCOMES. AS

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:16.240
IT IS FOR ONE THAT KEEPS A

02:25:16.307 --> 02:25:20.478
SEGREGATED AREN'T SITTING IN A

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:22.413
MEANINGFUL OUTCOMES THAT MATTER

02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:23.381
TO PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

02:25:23.448 --> 02:25:25.850
DISABILITIES THIS IS WHERE THE

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:27.819
CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE TODAY.

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:29.353
WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THOSE

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:31.489
INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOOSE TO WORK

02:25:31.556 --> 02:25:33.491
WITH US AND OUR FAMILY MEMBERS.

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:35.093
BUT WE ARE NOT A REGIONAL CENTER

02:25:35.159 --> 02:25:37.795
OR PROVIDER CENTERED SYSTEM WE

02:25:37.862 --> 02:25:40.198
ARE A PERSON CENTRED SYSTEM AND

02:25:40.264 --> 02:25:41.599
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUE WITH

02:25:41.666 --> 02:25:44.469
THIS LANDS YOU MIGHT COME AWAY

02:25:44.535 --> 02:25:45.470
WITH A VERY DIFFERENT

02:25:45.536 --> 02:25:46.704
PERSPECTIVE. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

02:25:46.771 --> 02:25:48.072
ESTABLISHED A MULTI YEAR

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:49.740

PROVIDERS WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

02:25:53.211 --> 02:25:55.313
THE APPROACH AND SCHEDULE. THAT

02:25:55.379 --> 02:25:57.381
TIES THE PHASE IN OF RATE

02:25:57.448 --> 02:25:58.416

HEARD REQUESTED A TO ACCELERATE

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:10.695
THE SCHEDULE THIS ACCELERATION

02:26:10.761 --> 02:26:12.296
SHOULD ONLY BE CONSIDERED IF WE

02:26:12.363 --> 02:26:14.098

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:21.072
SERVICES AND IMPROVED OUTCOMES

02:26:21.139 --> 02:26:23.241
FIRST RATE INCREASES SHOULD BE

02:26:23.307 --> 02:26:25.243
DIRECTLY LINKED TO AN INCREASE

02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:26.544
IN THE WAGES OF DIRECT SUPPORT

QUALITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES

MEETING THAT WE HAD WITH TVS ON

02:47:05.548 --> 02:47:08.251
QUALITY INCENTIVES HANDS ON

02:47:08.318 --> 02:47:10.019

X. WE EXPECT TO COURSE CORRECT

02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:21.698
ALONG THE WAY- AS DEVELOPED AS

02:47:21.765 --> 02:47:23.166
AS OUTCOMES AND MEASURES ARE

02:47:23.233 --> 02:47:25.335
DEVELOPED- AND I'M I'M NOT GONNA

02:47:25.402 --> 02:47:27.904
SPEAK TO THE TECHNOLOGY AND DATA

02:47:27.971 --> 02:47:29.572
SYSTEM THAT'S NOT MY WHEELHOUSE-

02:47:29.639 --> 02:47:31.808
BUT- WE'VE GOT TO START

02:47:31.875 --> 02:47:33.476
SOMEWHERE- AND I JUST I'VE HEARD

02:47:33.543 --> 02:47:35.278
THAT ECHOED- IN THE CAPITAL AS

02:47:35.345 --> 02:47:37.180
WELL SO THAT THAT WOULD BE MY

02:47:37.247 --> 02:47:38.748
COMMENTS. TO THAT QUESTION

02:47:38.815 --> 02:47:44.154
COMMONWEALTH'S IF KEEP WANTS. TO

02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:46.623
FOLLOW UP. THERE ARE SO YOU KNOW

02:47:46.689 --> 02:47:48.291
I MEAN FIRST ATTY COMBO. OF IS

02:47:48.358 --> 02:47:50.427
THAT THE OTHER DAY. THAT I GAVE

02:47:50.493 --> 02:47:51.528
YOU A SITE THAT THE- WE ACTUALLY

02:47:51.594 --> 02:47:52.962
HAVE MEASURES LIKE A- TO

02:47:53.029 --> 02:47:54.597
DEPARTMENT OR- A COUPLE OF

02:47:54.664 --> 02:47:57.967
STRANGE. HAVING JUST SAID THAT-

02:47:58.034 --> 02:47:59.769
I THINK. IT'S A FAIRLY LONG-

02:47:59.836 --> 02:48:01.371
EXPECTATION THAT SOMETHING

02:48:01.438 --> 02:48:02.906
AROUND WORKFORCE THE PEOPLE

02:48:02.972 --> 02:48:04.808
ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE SERVICE.

02:48:04.874 --> 02:48:07.110
WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE QUALITY

02:48:07.177 --> 02:48:09.879
OF. THAT OUTCOME FOR THE AT THE

02:48:09.946 --> 02:48:11.815
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL BUT WE'RE ALL

02:48:11.881 --> 02:48:13.750
SEEKING TO ACHIEVE SO. I THINK

02:48:13.817 --> 02:48:15.051
SUBJECT MATTER WISE IT'S

02:48:15.118 --> 02:48:17.787
CERTAINLY GOING TO BE INCLUDED-

02:48:17.854 --> 02:48:19.489
I THINK YOU WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE

02:48:19.556 --> 02:48:21.724
HERE PERHAPS THAT. COLLECTION OF

02:48:21.791 --> 02:48:23.193
DATA ABOUT THE WORK FORCE CAN BE

02:48:23.259 --> 02:48:24.794
SOMEWHAT SEPARATED FROM THE I.

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:29.532
T. SYSTEM. OF THE STATE OR

02:48:29.599 --> 02:48:30.633
NATIONALLY. OUR THE DEPARTMENT

02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:35.171
IS- ENGAGED AT MOMENT WITH-

02:48:35.238 --> 02:48:36.639
VARIETY OF. COLLECTING INPUT

02:48:36.706 --> 02:48:41.277
REGARD A S. OF STOPS THE BILL-

02:48:41.344 --> 02:48:43.513
WERE. THE OPERA. THAT EXISTS TO

02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:45.148
USE- THE NATIONAL CORE

02:48:45.215 --> 02:48:48.985
INDICATORS YOUR MODEL FOR THIS

02:48:49.052 --> 02:48:52.355
PURPOSE- IT'S- THAT MATCH CORN

02:48:52.422 --> 02:48:54.257
WE ARGUES FOR THEIR SURVEYS IN

02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:56.726
CALIFORNIA SERVING INDIVIDUALS

02:48:56.793 --> 02:49:01.064
FAMILIES ARE DARK GUARDIANS- AND

02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:03.233
ADULTS. AND THEY HAVE A MODEL

02:49:03.299 --> 02:49:05.001
AVAILABLE THAT'S USED BY MANY

02:49:05.068 --> 02:49:08.838
OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY-

02:49:08.905 --> 02:49:09.839
TO LOOK AT STAFF STABILITY SO

02:49:09.906 --> 02:49:11.841
THIS IS KIND OF WHAT YOU WOULD

02:49:11.908 --> 02:49:13.443
EXPECT RIGHT TURN OVER RATES

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:16.379
COMPENSATION LEVELS. ON THE BACK

02:49:16.446 --> 02:49:18.515
BENEFIT AMOUNTS AVERAGE TENURE

02:49:18.581 --> 02:49:22.452
OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- SO WE

02:49:22.519 --> 02:49:24.754
ARE HOPEFUL AND EXPECTING TO BE

02:49:24.821 --> 02:49:26.289
ABLE TO LAUNCH THAT IN THE

02:49:26.356 --> 02:49:28.591
SPRING THIS YEAR- THE NATIONAL

02:49:28.658 --> 02:49:30.360
SURVEY CLOSURE DATE IS AT THE

02:49:30.426 --> 02:49:33.897
END OF JUNE- I'M SO WE WOULD BE

02:49:33.963 --> 02:49:35.465
WE WOULD BE COLLECTING NOT NOT

02:49:35.532 --> 02:49:36.366
NOT THROUGH THE STATE OF

02:49:36.432 --> 02:49:37.901
CALIFORNIA I G. SYSTEM AND

02:49:37.967 --> 02:49:39.335
PROJECT BUT RATHER THROUGH THE

02:49:39.402 --> 02:49:42.472
NATIONAL SURVEYING- INSTRUMENT-

02:49:42.539 --> 02:49:43.840
THAT WAY THAT'S A SURVEY THIS

02:49:43.907 --> 02:49:46.142
COMPLETED BY. ARE THE SERVICE

02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:48.511
PROVIDERS AND VENDORS- THAT-

02:49:48.578 --> 02:49:49.579
EMPLOYEE DIRECT SERVICE

02:49:49.646 --> 02:49:51.648
PROFESSIONALS SO IT'S ALSO ONLY

02:49:51.714 --> 02:49:53.082
A SLICE OF THE WORK FORCE BUT

02:49:53.149 --> 02:49:54.551
THE VERY IMPORTANT SLICE THAT

02:49:54.617 --> 02:49:56.352
DIRECTLY- ENGAGES WITH

02:49:56.419 --> 02:50:01.157
CONSUMERS- AND SO WE ARE NOT BE

02:50:01.224 --> 02:50:02.191
THE FIRST TIME THAT CALIFORNIA

02:50:02.258 --> 02:50:05.862
WOULD DO THAT SURVEY- IT'S- AT

02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:08.331
LEAST CURRENTLY ENVISIONED AS A

02:50:08.398 --> 02:50:11.434
VOLUNTARY SURVEY- AND- AS SUCH

02:50:11.501 --> 02:50:13.236
YOU KNOW WE REALLY WANT FOLKS

02:50:13.303 --> 02:50:18.274
TO. HELP US SEE THE VALUE. IN IN

02:50:18.341 --> 02:50:20.243
PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION- YOU

02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:21.744
KNOWAND ASSURANCES THAT YOU

02:50:21.811 --> 02:50:23.379
KNOW IT WOULDN'T BE PUBLICLY

02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:24.581
RELEASED AT THE INDIVIDUAL

02:50:24.647 --> 02:50:26.349
PROVIDER LEVEL MAY HELP THE

02:50:26.416 --> 02:50:28.651
RESPONSE RATE FOR THIS IS REALLY

02:50:28.718 --> 02:50:31.120
CRITICAL WE THANK- THE SURVEY

02:50:31.187 --> 02:50:33.389
AND THAT THAT'S DONE NATIONALLY

02:50:33.456 --> 02:50:35.425
OF COURSES AFTER THE YEAR- IS

02:50:35.491 --> 02:50:37.293
CLOSED OF THIS SURVEY THAT WE

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:38.528
WOULD BE DURING THE SPRING WOULD

02:50:38.595 --> 02:50:40.697
BE FOR CALENDAR TWENTY TWENTY

02:50:40.763 --> 02:50:43.166
ONE. WE THINK IT'S ALSO TIMELY

02:50:43.232 --> 02:50:44.267
FOR THE VERY REASON THAT AS WE

02:50:44.334 --> 02:50:46.102
IMPLEMENT RATE ADJUSTMENTS

02:50:46.169 --> 02:50:48.471
CALENDAR TWENTY TWO WILL HAVE

02:50:48.538 --> 02:50:50.440
SOME BASELINE DATA ABOUT THAT EX

02:50:50.506 --> 02:50:52.475
AND SOME WAGES IN IN TWENTY

02:50:52.542 --> 02:50:54.711
TWENTY ONE. AND SO YOU CAN GO BY

02:50:54.777 --> 02:50:58.514
TOPIC AND SEE THAT THAT WOULD BE

02:50:58.581 --> 02:50:59.315
REALLY VALUABLE. I THINK THEY'RE

02:50:59.382 --> 02:51:00.450
VERY SHORT. THAT MR CHARTER

02:51:00.516 --> 02:51:03.553
YOU'RE- IS. THE I G. SYSTEM

02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:06.422
NECESSARILY. HAVE TO GET IN THE

02:51:06.489 --> 02:51:07.023
WAY OF COLLECTING SOME DATA

02:51:07.090 --> 02:51:09.592
TODAY- AND THAT THIRD PARTY

02:51:09.659 --> 02:51:11.427
PERSPECTIVE THAT I MENTIONED TO

02:51:11.494 --> 02:51:12.695
OF FINDING OUT YOU KNOW THE

02:51:12.762 --> 02:51:14.697
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. CONSUMER

02:51:14.764 --> 02:51:17.900
EXPERIENCE THE INDIVIDUAL A

02:51:17.967 --> 02:51:19.135
FAMILY EXPERIENCE. WHAT WITH THE

02:51:19.202 --> 02:51:20.436
DIRECTOR PROFESSIONALS AND

02:51:20.503 --> 02:51:21.904
SERVICE COORDINATORS AND SO

02:51:21.971 --> 02:51:25.775
FORTH- IS ALSO SUBJECT TO- THOSE

02:51:25.842 --> 02:51:28.311
OTHER AND SEE OUR MODULES THAT I

02:51:28.378 --> 02:51:30.013
REFERRED TO EARLIER- A COUPLE

02:51:30.079 --> 02:51:32.682
MINUTES AGO SO. THERE ARE THINGS

02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:35.184
THAT CAN BE DONE OUTSIDE OF THE

02:51:35.251 --> 02:51:37.120
CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ITSELF.

02:51:37.186 --> 02:51:38.488
BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE

02:51:38.554 --> 02:51:40.523
DEPARTMENT IS FIRMLY COMMITTED

02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:43.292
TO TAKING A WHAT I'LL CALL A

02:51:43.359 --> 02:51:45.028
WHOLE PERSON VIEW. OUR ENTER THE

02:51:45.094 --> 02:51:46.629
EXTENT OF THE PEOPLE ENGAGING

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:48.998
WHERE FOR MANAGING THE CASE OF

02:51:49.065 --> 02:51:49.999
ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

02:51:50.066 --> 02:51:53.036
PROVIDING SERVICES TO- IT'S

02:51:53.102 --> 02:51:54.470
REALLY NICE OF ALL OF THIS COULD

02:51:54.537 --> 02:51:56.105
BE THOUGHTFULLY WHILE TIED

02:51:56.172 --> 02:51:58.141
TOGETHER. SO EVEN THE SURVEY

02:51:58.207 --> 02:52:00.209
DATA AND INDIVIDUAL SURVEY DATA

02:52:00.276 --> 02:52:02.679
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS WILL BEGIN

02:52:02.745 --> 02:52:03.279
TO ITERATE AND AFTER COULD BE

02:52:03.346 --> 02:52:04.781
CAPTURED IN A CASE MANAGEMENT

02:52:04.847 --> 02:52:06.315
SYSTEM AND WE WOULD ACTUALLY

02:52:06.382 --> 02:52:08.451
KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING.

02:52:08.518 --> 02:52:10.386
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GETTING. YOU

02:52:10.453 --> 02:52:11.921
COULD SEE IMMEDIATELY WHETHER

02:52:11.988 --> 02:52:13.456
WOULD BE BENEFIT TO THAT SO

02:52:13.523 --> 02:52:15.258
SHORT TERM OPPORTUNITIES LONG

02:52:15.324 --> 02:52:17.527
TERM GOAL. AND LOTS OF WORK IN

02:52:17.593 --> 02:52:18.828
THE MIDDLE AND REALLY AGAIN

02:52:18.895 --> 02:52:22.832
GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS.

02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:24.467
THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS

02:52:24.534 --> 02:52:25.068
HAPPEN. I THANK I THINK ALONG

02:52:25.134 --> 02:52:26.436
THOSE LINES WITH FROM WHEN THAT

02:52:26.502 --> 02:52:27.904
THE GREAT AND OP. AND I AND I

02:52:27.970 --> 02:52:29.038
WILL SHARE AN APPRECIATION WITH

02:52:29.105 --> 02:52:30.807
THIS ADMINISTRATION TO FULLY

02:52:30.873 --> 02:52:33.209
FUNDING THE RATE STUDY. IN LAST

02:52:33.276 --> 02:52:34.811
YEAR'S BUDGET BUT HIS COMMENT IS

02:52:34.877 --> 02:52:36.446
THAT HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:52:36.512 --> 02:52:39.515
PRESENT. AND I THINK WE HEARD

02:52:39.582 --> 02:52:44.053
FROM A NUMBER OF- FRONTLINE.

02:52:44.120 --> 02:52:47.023
PARENTS AND- EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:49.192
OF REGIONAL CENTERS ABOUT WHAT

02:52:49.258 --> 02:52:51.894
TODAY LOOKS LIKE- JUDY MARKS

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:54.097
WORDS WERE THAT SHE HAS TO FIGHT

02:52:54.163 --> 02:52:58.167
TO GET SERVICES. FROM MARC CLAUS

02:52:58.234 --> 02:52:59.402
WE HEARD THAT THERE ARE NOT

02:52:59.469 --> 02:53:01.204
DISRUPTIONS THAT THERE ARE NOT

02:53:01.270 --> 02:53:04.874
SERVICES. AND I'M CONCERNED THAT

02:53:04.941 --> 02:53:07.410
WHILE WE ALL ARE APPRECIATIVE OF

02:53:07.477 --> 02:53:09.645
WHERE WE WELL AS AS YOU SAID. NO

02:53:09.712 --> 02:53:10.747
WE'RE WE'RE GETTING TO AT THE

02:53:10.813 --> 02:53:12.715
END OF THE ROAD FOR SOME OF OUR

02:53:12.782 --> 02:53:14.650
FAMILIES WE CAN'T GET THERE FAST

02:53:14.717 --> 02:53:16.252
ENOUGH. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING

02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:19.188
THE SERVICES TODAY AND I BELIEVE

02:53:19.255 --> 02:53:24.360
THAT'S THE REAL- IMPETUS FOR US

02:53:24.427 --> 02:53:26.095
TO LOOK TOWARDS ADVANCING THIS

02:53:26.162 --> 02:53:28.331
RATE STUDY AND FIGURING OUT WHAT

02:53:28.397 --> 02:53:30.166
IS POSSIBLE AND SO I WILL COME

02:53:30.233 --> 02:53:32.068
BACK TO MY INITIAL COMMENTS BUT

02:53:32.135 --> 02:53:35.838
WOULD LOVE TO- FIGURE OUT IF

02:53:35.905 --> 02:53:38.474
THIS CAN BE ACCELERATED AND THEN

02:53:38.541 --> 02:53:40.243
FOR US TO EVALUATE WHETHER IT

02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:42.211
SHOULD BE XCELERATED IS THE

02:53:42.278 --> 02:53:44.113
SECOND QUESTION BUT BUT I DO

02:53:44.180 --> 02:53:46.415
WANT TO COME BACK TO ONE FINAL

02:53:46.482 --> 02:53:48.217
QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON WHICH

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:51.387
IS- THIS WAS A POINT IN TIME FOR

02:53:51.454 --> 02:53:53.189
THE RATE STUDY AND WOULD LIKE TO

02:53:53.256 --> 02:53:55.124
ASK THE ADMINISTRATION WHETHER

02:53:55.191 --> 02:53:57.393
THEY THINK OF FUTURE RATE STUDY

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:59.662
WILL BE WARRANTED AFTER THE

02:53:59.729 --> 02:54:02.865
COMPLETION. OF THE INCREASE THAT

02:54:02.932 --> 02:54:04.367
WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT AND WHETHER

02:54:04.433 --> 02:54:08.070
OF REGULAR- RETURN TO THIS IS

02:54:08.137 --> 02:54:10.206
ALSO SOMETHING THAT- THEY

02:54:10.273 --> 02:54:12.241
BELIEVE IS NECESSARY FOR US TO

02:54:12.308 --> 02:54:15.211
KEEP UP TO DATE- WITH THOSE

02:54:15.278 --> 02:54:19.348
PROVIDER RATE. YEAH YOU CHAIR

02:54:19.415 --> 02:54:21.050
JIM KNIGHT WITH THE DEPARTMENT

03:32:43.117 --> 03:32:45.419
THAT TECHNOLOGY WHICH WAS ONE OF

03:32:45.486 --> 03:32:46.987
THE UP SIDES AS WELL AS THE

03:32:47.054 --> 03:32:48.822
DOWNSIDE OF PROVIDING SERVICES

03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:51.325
DURING THE PANDEMIC- THE

03:32:51.391 --> 03:32:52.893
COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT OF OUR

03:32:52.960 --> 03:32:54.294
COMMUNITY DEFINITELY HELPS TO

03:32:54.361 --> 03:32:56.163
STAY ON TOP OF WHATEVER THOSE

03:32:56.230 --> 03:32:59.399
CHANGING NEEDS ARE- MAKING THAT

03:32:59.466 --> 03:33:00.834
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND IN THE

03:33:00.901 --> 03:33:02.503
USE OF TECHNOLOGY IT WILL

03:33:02.569 --> 03:33:04.538
IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION IT

03:33:04.605 --> 03:33:06.340
ALLOWED FOR GREATER STAKEHOLDER

03:33:06.406 --> 03:33:08.342
ENGAGEMENT MORE FREQUENT MORE

03:33:08.408 --> 03:33:12.813
PARTICIPATION. AND THEN IT ALSO

03:33:12.880 --> 03:33:14.047
ABOUT FOLKS TO DEVELOP NEW

03:33:14.114 --> 03:33:16.383
SKILLS SO WHILE SOME INDIVIDUALS

03:33:16.450 --> 03:33:18.051
IN SOME PROVIDERS DID IDENTIFY

03:33:18.118 --> 03:33:19.987
THAT REMOTE SERVICES IN THE USED

03:33:20.053 --> 03:33:22.523
TO BACK TECHNOLOGY. EXPANDED

03:33:22.589 --> 03:33:24.258
THEIR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IT

03:33:24.324 --> 03:33:25.759
PROVIDED FLEXIBILITY IN

03:33:25.826 --> 03:33:27.761
SCHEDULING OF ONE OF THE

03:33:27.828 --> 03:33:31.298
EXAMPLES THERE IS FROM OUR EARLY

03:33:31.365 --> 03:33:32.065
START SERVICE PROVIDERS. THEY

03:33:32.132 --> 03:33:33.901
AND THE FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO

03:33:33.967 --> 03:33:35.068
INCREASE THAT SCHEDULING

03:33:35.135 --> 03:33:37.204
FLEXIBILITY SO MORE OFTEN THEY

03:33:37.271 --> 03:33:39.473
WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY CONNECT-

03:33:39.540 --> 03:33:41.208
BUT A LOT FOR SOME OF THE

03:33:41.275 --> 03:33:42.342
COACHING OPPORTUNITIES.

03:33:42.409 --> 03:33:43.710
IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES THAT

03:33:43.777 --> 03:33:45.479
WILL HELP SUPPORT THE CHILDREN.

03:33:45.546 --> 03:33:47.014
BUT THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT

03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:48.582
TECHNOLOGY WAS IT HIGHLIGHTED

03:33:48.649 --> 03:33:49.816
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT

03:33:49.883 --> 03:33:51.652
CONTINUES TO EXIST SO I'M

03:33:51.718 --> 03:33:53.954
LOOKING AT MORE EFFORTS TO MAKE

03:33:54.021 --> 03:33:57.291
IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT AREA. OUR

03:33:57.357 --> 03:33:59.159
AND THEN OF COURSE AS WE EMERGE

03:33:59.226 --> 03:33:59.826
FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH

03:33:59.893 --> 03:34:02.129
EMERGENCY- WHAT WE LEARNED

03:34:02.196 --> 03:34:03.730
WHAT'S FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS THE

03:34:03.797 --> 03:34:05.532
REMOTE SERVICES WORK WHILE.

03:34:05.599 --> 03:34:07.668
OTHERS DEFINITELY PREFER IN

03:34:07.734 --> 03:34:08.735
PERSON AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD

03:34:08.802 --> 03:34:11.538
TO. THAT INCREASING TRACKING IT

03:34:11.605 --> 03:34:14.041
WILL DISSIPATE. THERE WILL ALSO

03:34:14.107 --> 03:34:16.577
BE A FACTOR OF THE OF THE

03:34:16.643 --> 03:34:20.013
COMMUNITY THAT ONCE A BLANK-

03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:21.148
FIRST WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT'S

03:34:21.215 --> 03:34:23.183
CAN GET. AS WE ARE ADDRESSED

PRIMARY- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

03:35:01.088 --> 03:35:01.922
RAISE I GUESS IS JUST THAT THE

03:35:01.989 --> 03:35:04.091
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT KOBE

03:35:04.157 --> 03:35:05.058
NINETEEN WILL REALLY BE A LONG

03:35:05.125 --> 03:35:07.794
TERM. ISSUE EVEN IF IT'S NOT AS

03:35:07.861 --> 03:35:10.063
EXTREME AS IT HAS BEEN- OVER

03:35:10.130 --> 03:35:12.899
THESE PAST TWO YEARS AND SO IF

03:35:12.966 --> 03:35:15.068

AKIN TO THE FLU- ANNUAL FLU.

03:35:18.572 --> 03:35:19.539
MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH

03:35:19.606 --> 03:35:21.275
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WILL

03:35:21.341 --> 03:35:23.110
BE AT HIGHER RISK OF DISEASE OR

03:35:23.176 --> 03:35:25.279
SERIOUS ILLNESS- DUE TO

03:35:36.256 --> 03:35:38.825
IMPORTANCE OF- DDS IN REGIONAL

POINTS AND TERMS OF LESSONS

03:43:21.187 --> 03:43:22.655
LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC FIRST

03:43:22.722 --> 03:43:26.025
I JUST WANT TO ECHO- BUT- IS

03:43:26.092 --> 03:43:28.094
HEROES THAT- ABOUT THE

03:43:28.161 --> 03:43:29.963
IMPORTANCE OF THE FLEXIBILITY

03:43:30.029 --> 03:43:31.531
THAT DDS GAVE THE REGIONAL

03:43:31.598 --> 03:43:33.666
CENTERS QUICKLY AT THE BEGINNING

03:43:33.733 --> 03:43:34.634
OF A PANDEMIC. THAT WAS

03:43:34.701 --> 03:43:37.804
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT DDS TO FAST

03:43:37.871 --> 03:43:39.472
AND IT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE SO

03:43:39.539 --> 03:43:40.840
I JUST WANT TO LOOK THAT UP AND

03:43:40.907 --> 03:43:43.009
I AGREE THAT THAT THAT KIND OF

03:43:43.076 --> 03:43:45.211
FLEXIBILITY AND RAPID RESPONSE

03:43:45.278 --> 03:43:48.148
FROM DDS IS SOMETHING THAT-

03:43:48.214 --> 03:43:50.116
SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO TRY TO DO

03:43:50.183 --> 03:43:52.085
IN RESPONSE TO ANY EMERGENCY NOT

03:43:52.152 --> 03:43:54.020
JUST IN THE PANDEMIC AND SOME OF

03:43:54.087 --> 03:43:55.755
IT. SHOULD BE BAKED INTO THEIR

03:43:55.822 --> 03:43:57.223
REGULAR POLICIES SO I REALLY

03:43:57.290 --> 03:44:04.864
APPRECIATED. HER COMMENT ON THAT

03:44:04.931 --> 03:44:06.032
. NO ACROSS THE TWENTY REGIONAL

03:44:06.099 --> 03:44:07.700
CENTERS. WE DID NOT SEE CONCERT

03:44:07.767 --> 03:44:09.235
. AND HOW RESPOND TO THE- SOME

03:44:09.302 --> 03:44:10.804
REGIONAL WE'RE BETTER AT THE- OF

03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:13.072
TIME MOLD WAYS OF COMMUNICATING

03:44:13.139 --> 03:44:14.474
. WITH THEIR CONSUMERS

03:44:14.541 --> 03:44:15.909
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED IN

03:44:15.975 --> 03:44:18.111
ORDER TO STAY SAFE. AND TO HAVE

03:44:18.178 --> 03:44:19.646
SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC

03:44:19.712 --> 03:44:21.114
I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO AS A

03:44:21.181 --> 03:44:23.049
POSITIVE EXAMPLE. THE VALLEY

03:44:23.116 --> 03:44:25.084
MOUNTAIN REGIONAL CENTER WHICH

03:44:25.151 --> 03:44:26.686
DIDN'T JUST RELY ON EMAIL

03:44:26.753 --> 03:44:28.721
UPDATES AS AS MOST OF THE

03:44:28.788 --> 03:44:30.356
REGIONAL CENTERS DEAD. BUT THEY

03:44:30.423 --> 03:44:32.325
ALSO HAD IN PERSON OUTREACH

03:44:32.392 --> 03:44:33.726
SESSIONS AND THEY HAD MULTIPLE

03:44:33.793 --> 03:44:35.495
WAYS OF REACHING OUT TO MAKE

03:44:35.562 --> 03:44:36.696
SURE. PEOPLE HAVE THE

03:44:36.763 --> 03:44:38.064
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO

03:44:38.131 --> 03:44:40.700
STAY SAFE. DURING THE PANDEMIC

03:44:40.767 --> 03:44:42.035
ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE THERE'S

03:44:42.101 --> 03:44:43.937
BEEN INCONSISTENCY HAS SOME

03:44:44.003 --> 03:44:46.673
REGIONAL CENTERS. HAVE A DATE

03:44:46.739 --> 03:44:48.107
AND SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP

03:44:48.174 --> 03:44:49.342
PAYING FOR SOME OF THESE

03:44:49.409 --> 03:44:52.178
PANDEMIC RELATED SERVICES AFTER.

03:44:52.245 --> 03:44:53.713
YOU KNOW APRIL FIRST OR AFTER

03:44:53.780 --> 03:44:55.982
JANUARY FIRST. NOT WITHSTANDING

03:44:56.049 --> 03:44:57.150
THE FACT THAT THE PANDEMIC IS

03:44:57.217 --> 03:44:58.918
STILL ON GOING AND NONE OF US

03:44:58.985 --> 03:45:00.753
KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA AND SO.

03:45:00.820 --> 03:45:02.555
WE'D LIKE TO SEE MORE CONSISTENT

03:45:02.622 --> 03:45:04.524
OVERSIGHT FROM DDS TELLING THE

03:45:04.591 --> 03:45:06.626
REGIONAL CENTERS FLEXIBILITY IS

03:45:06.693 --> 03:45:08.194
REALLY IMPORTANT NOW JUST LIKE

03:45:08.261 --> 03:45:09.162
IT WAS IMPORTANT AT THE

03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:10.830
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMICS AND

03:45:10.897 --> 03:45:12.699
YOU SHOULD NOT SET ARBITRARY

03:45:12.765 --> 03:45:14.200
DATES AROUND WHICH CERTAIN

03:45:14.267 --> 03:45:17.103
SERVICES ARE GONNA AND- I ALSO

03:45:17.170 --> 03:45:18.938
JUST WANTED TO LIFT UP. THE

03:45:19.005 --> 03:45:20.240
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE

03:45:20.306 --> 03:45:21.708
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

03:45:21.774 --> 03:45:22.642
DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL

03:45:22.709 --> 03:45:24.377
SERVICES AND THE CALIFORNIA

03:45:24.444 --> 03:45:26.212
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

03:45:26.279 --> 03:45:27.480
THERE WERE MANY POINTS DURING

03:45:27.547 --> 03:45:29.148
THE PANDEMIC. WHERE THE

03:45:29.215 --> 03:45:30.717
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

03:45:30.783 --> 03:45:32.552
HEALTH MADE DECISIONS THAT

03:45:32.619 --> 03:45:33.887
TURNED OUT NOT TO BE GREAT

03:45:33.953 --> 03:45:36.122
DECISIONS IN PART BECAUSE THEY

03:45:36.189 --> 03:45:37.156
WEREN'T TALKING TO THE

03:45:37.223 --> 03:45:38.191
DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL

03:45:38.258 --> 03:45:40.093
SERVICES AND OTHER FOLKS TO KIND

03:45:40.159 --> 03:45:41.527
OF HELP THEM AVOID. THOSE

03:45:41.594 --> 03:45:43.296
DECISIONS MORE EXAMPLE WAS THE

03:45:43.363 --> 03:45:44.697
CRISIS STANDARDS OF CARE

03:45:44.764 --> 03:45:46.466
GUIDELINES WHEN THEY CAME OUT

03:45:46.532 --> 03:45:48.268
WITH DRAFT GUIDELINES EARLY IN

03:45:48.334 --> 03:45:50.069
THE PANDEMIC. THE BASICALLY SAID

03:45:50.136 --> 03:45:51.471
IT WAS OKAY TO DISCRIMINATE

03:45:51.537 --> 03:45:52.839
AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

03:45:52.906 --> 03:45:54.607
ARE OLDER PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE

03:45:54.674 --> 03:45:56.009
DECIDING WHO'S GOING TO GET A

03:45:56.075 --> 03:46:03.716
VENTILATOR OR OTHER- SCARE.

03:46:03.783 --> 03:46:05.084
SERVICE IN A IN A- AND HEALTH

03:46:05.151 --> 03:46:07.086
CARE RATIONING SUCH A- WE ABLE

03:46:07.153 --> 03:46:08.254
TO PUSH. AND THEY'D SAY THEIR-

03:46:08.321 --> 03:46:10.323
AND I GREW THAT TIME CAL. HAS

03:46:10.390 --> 03:46:10.990
TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT

03:46:11.057 --> 03:46:12.692
LISTENER AND A ALLY TO THE-

03:46:12.759 --> 03:46:13.760
COMMUNITIES BUT IT WAS A TRUCK

03:46:13.826 --> 03:46:16.796
THAT. WAS NOT. ABLE TO THERE WAS

03:46:16.863 --> 03:46:18.164
TO BEAR FOR THOSE TRAPPED

03:46:18.231 --> 03:46:19.866
GUIDELINES FOR RELIEF. ANOTHER

03:46:19.933 --> 03:46:21.601
EXAMPLE WAS ON BACK

03:46:21.668 --> 03:46:22.936
PRIVATIZATION AGAIN THEY ENDED

03:46:23.002 --> 03:46:25.071
UP IN A GOOD PLACE. BUT WE HAD

03:46:25.138 --> 03:46:26.339
TO HAVE A FIGHT TO GET THE

03:46:26.406 --> 03:46:27.707
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

03:46:27.774 --> 03:46:30.543
HEALTH TO PRIORITIZE. UNDER

03:46:30.610 --> 03:46:31.044
SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE WITH

03:46:31.110 --> 03:46:32.912
DISABILITIES WHO ARE HIGH RISK

03:46:32.979 --> 03:46:34.280
INCLUDING EVERYBODY WHO'S THE

03:46:34.347 --> 03:46:35.882
REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMER THAT'S

03:46:35.949 --> 03:46:37.583
WHERE THEY ENDED UP. BUT IT WAS

03:46:37.650 --> 03:46:41.454
A THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK. AND

03:46:41.521 --> 03:46:42.021
FORTH BEFORE WE GOT TO THAT

03:46:42.088 --> 03:46:42.956
POINT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS A

03:46:43.022 --> 03:46:45.024
HOSPITAL VISITATIONS WE HAD TO

03:46:45.091 --> 03:46:46.859
PUSH HARD. TO GET THE CALIFORNIA

03:46:46.926 --> 03:46:48.394
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO

03:46:48.461 --> 03:46:50.129

DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OR

03:46:51.597 --> 03:46:53.066

03:46:53.132 --> 03:46:55.435
BE ABLE TO BRING. A SAFE PERSON

03:46:55.501 --> 03:46:57.971
WITH THEM SOME INFO CONTRA WITH

03:46:58.037 --> 03:46:59.038
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A POLICY

03:46:59.105 --> 03:47:00.673
AGAINST LETTING PEOPLE BRING

03:47:00.740 --> 03:47:02.308
VISITORS TO HOSPITAL WE SAW THAT

03:47:02.375 --> 03:47:04.377
AS AN ACCOMMODATION. UNDER THE

AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT

03:47:06.212 --> 03:47:07.981

03:47:08.047 --> 03:47:10.116
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO HAVE. I

03:47:10.183 --> 03:47:14.120
ALSO JUST WANT TO LET DOWN. THIS

03:47:14.187 --> 03:47:15.321
PARADIGM HAS DESTROYED A LOT OF

03:47:15.388 --> 03:47:17.123

EMPLOYMENT AND SEGREGATED

03:47:21.394 --> 03:47:23.496
EMPLOYMENT. AND I JUST ENCOURAGE

03:47:23.563 --> 03:47:24.964
US AS WE REBUILD FROM THE

03:47:25.031 --> 03:47:27.333
PANDEMIC. TO ASK THE QUESTION

03:47:27.400 --> 03:47:30.036
WHEN WE LOOK AT A SERVICE MODEL.

03:47:30.103 --> 03:47:31.471
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ADVANCE

03:47:31.537 --> 03:47:33.406
INTEGRATION WHAT ARE YOU DOING

03:47:33.473 --> 03:47:35.308
TO ADVANCE SELF DETERMINATION

03:47:35.375 --> 03:47:36.876
AND WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO

03:47:36.943 --> 03:47:38.478
ADVANCE EQUITY. AND IF THE

03:47:38.544 --> 03:47:40.279
SERVICE MODEL IS NOT REALLY

03:47:40.346 --> 03:47:41.981
ADVANCING THOSE CALLS THE MAYBE

03:47:42.048 --> 03:47:43.316
WE SHOULDN'T BE BUILT ABOUT WE

03:47:43.383 --> 03:47:45.118
SHOULD HELP THEM INNOVATE. TO

03:47:45.184 --> 03:47:49.022
CREATE A NEW SERVICE MODEL THAT

03:47:49.088 --> 03:47:50.023
WOULD ENHANCE THOSE CAUGHT. THE

03:47:50.089 --> 03:47:51.791

03:48:06.539 --> 03:48:08.441
LOT OF WAYS TO EXPLAIN IT BUT

03:48:08.508 --> 03:48:10.009
WANT TO EXPLAIN IT IS

03:48:10.076 --> 03:48:11.944
DISCRIMINATION I DON'T THINK I

03:48:12.011 --> 03:48:13.112

CLARIFICATION TO THE FAMILY

04:15:08.660 --> 04:15:10.161
HAVE PROVIDED LEADERSHIP AND

04:15:10.228 --> 04:15:12.397
CLARIFICATION IS THROUGH OTHER

CENTER PURCHASE OF SERVICE

04:15:15.099 --> 04:15:16.968
POLICIES. THESE ARE POLICIES

THAT ARE USED BY REGIONAL CENTER

04:15:18.703 --> 04:15:21.906
STAFF TO HELP GUIDE THEM ON THE

PURCHASE OF SERVICES AND SO THE

04:15:24.342 --> 04:15:25.777
DEPARTMENT HAS A REALLY CRITICAL

04:15:25.843 --> 04:15:27.545
ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THOSE

04:15:27.612 --> 04:15:30.148
POLICIES COMPLY WITH UP STATUTES

04:15:30.214 --> 04:15:31.749

DECISIONS SO WE'VE BEEN DOING

04:15:35.520 --> 04:15:36.821
THAT ON ON GOING BASIS. BOB WE

04:15:36.888 --> 04:15:37.822
HAVE BEEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL

04:15:37.889 --> 04:15:39.357
ASSISTANCE TO REGIONAL CENTERS

04:15:39.424 --> 04:15:40.692
ON THE RESTORATION OF SOCIAL

04:15:40.758 --> 04:15:43.194
RECREATION CAMP. AT ALSO

04:15:43.261 --> 04:15:44.962
REQUIRED EACH OF THE REGIONAL

04:15:45.029 --> 04:15:46.664

04:15:46.731 --> 04:15:49.534
TRAINING PLAN WITH A FOCUS ON

04:15:49.600 --> 04:15:50.401
UNDERSTOOD UNDERSERVED

04:15:50.468 --> 04:15:52.804
COMMUNITIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:55.273
THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE. AWARE OF

04:15:55.339 --> 04:15:58.376
THE RESTORATION AND FAMILIAR

04:15:58.443 --> 04:16:01.245
WITH THE SERVICE OF THIS-

04:16:01.312 --> 04:16:02.947
ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHAT IS DÍAS%

04:16:03.014 --> 04:16:04.982
DOING OR WILL DO TO TRACK THE

04:16:05.049 --> 04:16:09.520
IMPACT ON DISPARITIES. AGAIN THE

04:16:09.587 --> 04:16:10.555
OUTREACH PLAN TO THE REGIONAL

04:16:10.621 --> 04:16:12.323
CENTERS BUT THE RESULTS HAD TO

04:16:12.390 --> 04:16:15.159
CREATE- REFLECTS THAT COMMITMENT

04:16:15.226 --> 04:16:17.361
TO OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES-

04:16:17.428 --> 04:16:19.363
WE ALSO HAVE CREATED A SOME

04:16:19.430 --> 04:16:21.566
CODE. THAT REGIONAL CENTERS CAN

04:16:21.632 --> 04:16:23.668
USE THAT THEY CAN IDENTIFY ALL

04:16:23.735 --> 04:16:25.903
SERVICES THAT ARE PURCHASED FOR

04:16:25.970 --> 04:16:30.208
SOCIAL RECREATION- SANDERS CAN

04:16:30.274 --> 04:16:32.076
PURCHASE SOCIAL RECREATION AND A

04:16:32.143 --> 04:16:33.911
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT

04:16:33.978 --> 04:16:36.481
ISN'T ALWAYS- OBVIOUS ON ITS

04:16:36.547 --> 04:16:38.449
FACE THAT THAT WAS THIRTY INTO A

04:16:38.516 --> 04:16:40.318
PURPOSE LESS SOCIAL RECREATION.

04:16:40.384 --> 04:16:41.686
SO THROUGH THE USE OF THE SUB

PROJECTS CAN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS

04:20:54.572 --> 04:20:56.273
TO COMPLETE GIVEN THE SIZE AND

04:20:56.340 --> 04:20:59.176

CONCERN WHICH WE REYES

04:22:27.031 --> 04:22:28.532
THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING TODAY IS

04:22:28.599 --> 04:22:31.402

04:22:31.469 --> 04:22:32.937
OR CHALLENGES IT'S BEGIN TO

04:22:33.003 --> 04:22:34.605
ARISE OR THE DEPARTMENT HAS

04:22:34.672 --> 04:22:35.940
NOTICED THAT MAYBE SOMETHING

04:22:36.006 --> 04:22:39.844

THEY RECOMMEND- DOING IN ORDER

04:22:56.160 --> 04:22:57.728
TO ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES AND

04:22:57.795 --> 04:22:58.829
YOU KNOW I'LL JUST GIVE ONE

04:22:58.896 --> 04:23:00.464
EXAMPLE FROM THE PAST I MEAN I

04:23:00.531 --> 04:23:01.932
DO THINK THE SYSTEM IS IN A

04:23:01.999 --> 04:23:03.968
DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT PLACE. NOW

04:23:04.034 --> 04:23:06.604
THAN IT WAS IN SAY TWENTY

04:23:06.670 --> 04:23:07.771
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUT- AT THAT

04:23:07.838 --> 04:23:09.373
TIME THE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN

04:23:09.440 --> 04:23:12.443
GIVEN FUNDING. FOR THE-

04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:14.712
INCENTIVES FOR COMPETITIVE

04:23:14.778 --> 04:23:23.220
INTEGRATED. AND OVER THE COURSE

04:23:23.287 --> 04:23:24.722
OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IT

04:23:24.788 --> 04:23:26.257
STARTED TO COME TO LIGHT THAT

04:23:26.323 --> 04:23:28.225
THE DEPARTMENT WAS REALLY UNABLE

04:23:28.292 --> 04:23:30.895
TO USE MUCH- HARDLY ANY OF THAT

04:23:30.961 --> 04:23:32.630
FUNDING RELATED TO PROVIDE THOSE

04:23:32.696 --> 04:23:33.998
INCENTIVES LIKE THERE IS

04:23:34.064 --> 04:23:38.135
OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM- IN. HOW

04:23:38.202 --> 04:23:40.437
EMPLOYMENT WAS BEING APPROACHED

04:23:40.504 --> 04:23:41.472
AND I MEAN THERE'S STILL A

04:23:41.539 --> 04:23:42.773
PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO GET THOSE

04:23:42.840 --> 04:23:44.842
INCENTIVES OUT THE DOOR SO TO

04:23:44.909 --> 04:23:46.343
THE EXTENT THAT THOSE KINDS OF

04:23:46.410 --> 04:23:48.078
PROBLEMS START TO CROP UP WITH

04:23:48.145 --> 04:23:49.747
ANY OF THE NEW INITIATIVES WE

04:23:49.813 --> 04:23:51.115
WOULD HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

04:23:51.182 --> 04:23:53.150
WOULD NOT LET THE LEGISLATURE NO

04:23:53.217 --> 04:23:55.152
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. SHOULD

04:23:55.219 --> 04:23:57.388
THERE BE CHANGES IN POLICY THAT

04:23:57.454 --> 04:24:00.658
WOULD HELP- IMPROVE. THE

04:24:00.724 --> 04:24:01.592
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROGRAMS

04:24:01.659 --> 04:24:04.195

04:24:16.106 --> 04:24:17.041
SYSTEM DIRECTOR OF

04:24:17.107 --> 04:24:19.476
COMMUNICATIONS RIGHT SAID

04:24:19.543 --> 04:24:21.178
DISABILITY VOICES UNITED.

04:24:21.245 --> 04:24:23.547
YESTERDAY WAS MY BIRTHDAY SO I'M

04:24:23.614 --> 04:24:25.516
GONZALEZ FORTY SEVEN HE ROLLED

04:24:25.583 --> 04:24:27.818
CAREER IN AMERICAN MAN WHO HAS

04:24:27.885 --> 04:24:30.521
CEREBRAL PALSY. I AM USING A

04:24:30.588 --> 04:24:32.556
COMMUNICATION DEVICE AT THE BASE

04:24:32.623 --> 04:24:34.959
OF MY WHEELCHAIR BY TYPING WITH

04:24:35.025 --> 04:24:37.695
MY TOES. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU

04:24:37.761 --> 04:24:39.530
HOW MUCH THE SELF DETERMINATION

04:24:39.597 --> 04:24:42.132
PROGRAM HAS CHANGED MY LIFE AND

04:24:42.199 --> 04:24:43.567
ASK YOU TO BREAK DOWN THE

04:24:43.634 --> 04:24:47.605
BARRIERS SO THAT OTHER LIVES CAN

04:24:47.671 --> 04:24:50.007
BE CHANGED AS WELL. I WAS IN THE

04:24:50.074 --> 04:24:51.642
TRADITIONAL REGIONAL CENTER

04:24:51.709 --> 04:24:54.745
SYSTEM FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I

04:24:54.812 --> 04:24:56.347
WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I WAS

04:24:56.413 --> 04:24:57.948
HAPPY WITH MY LIFE UNDER THE

04:24:58.015 --> 04:24:59.984
BROKEN SYSTEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T

04:25:00.050 --> 04:25:02.486
KNOW THAT I WAS EATING MEATLOAF

04:25:02.553 --> 04:25:04.888
EVERY NIGHT WITH KETCHUP.I FELT

04:25:04.955 --> 04:25:07.625
THIS WAY FOR PRETTY MUCH ALL OF

04:25:07.691 --> 04:25:09.693
MY LIFE. THE AGENCIES THAT HIRE

04:25:09.760 --> 04:25:12.029
THE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT ME NEVER

04:25:12.096 --> 04:25:13.931
ASKED WHAT THEY COULD DO BETTER.

04:25:13.998 --> 04:25:16.500
EVERYONE JUST ASSUMED THAT I WAS

04:25:16.567 --> 04:25:20.337
DOING FINE. IF YOU SWITCH THE

04:25:20.404 --> 04:25:22.539
LAST TWO LETTERS IN MY NAME IT

04:25:22.606 --> 04:25:26.610
SPELLS T. M. HI. SO I'M GOING TO

04:25:26.677 --> 04:25:28.612
BE VERY HONEST. UNDER THE

04:25:28.679 --> 04:25:30.881
TRADITIONAL SYSTEM I SUFFER FROM

04:25:30.948 --> 04:25:34.218
NEGLECT. BY STAFF CAME TO MY JOB

04:25:34.285 --> 04:25:36.320
ONLY ONCE DURING THE DAY TO HELP

04:25:36.387 --> 04:25:37.888
ME GO TO THE BATHROOM AND SHE'D

04:25:37.955 --> 04:25:40.224
BE LUNCH. THIS LED TO MANY

04:25:40.291 --> 04:25:42.226
TOILET ACCIDENTS BECAUSE I

04:25:42.293 --> 04:25:43.727
DIDN'T HAVE SUPPORT WHEN I

04:25:43.794 --> 04:25:46.297
NEEDED IT. I MISSED NUMEROUS

04:25:46.363 --> 04:25:48.165
LAUNCHES BECAUSE THE AGENCIES

04:25:48.232 --> 04:25:50.301
COULDN'T FIND RELIABLE PEOPLE TO

04:25:50.367 --> 04:25:52.870
HELP ME. THE AGENCIES WHICH SAID

04:25:52.936 --> 04:25:54.905
RANDOM STAFF WHO DIDN'T KNOW OR

04:25:54.972 --> 04:25:57.408
RESPECT ME. IF I WANTED TO GO

04:25:57.474 --> 04:25:59.009
OUT TO DINNER WITH FRIENDS OR

04:25:59.076 --> 04:26:01.645
FAMILY I HAD TO BE HOME BY EIGHT

04:26:01.712 --> 04:26:03.714
PM BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN THE

04:26:03.781 --> 04:26:06.216
SHIFT CHANGE HAPPENED. I NEEDED

04:26:06.283 --> 04:26:09.620
TO ASK. PERMISSION TO LIVE MY

04:26:09.687 --> 04:26:13.057
LIFE. SINCE I STARTED IN THE

04:26:13.123 --> 04:26:15.292
SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM I'VE

04:26:15.359 --> 04:26:17.561
BEEN SEEING FRIENDS THAT I

04:26:17.628 --> 04:26:19.630
HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG TIME. I

04:26:19.697 --> 04:26:22.132
NOW WORKOUT IN THE GYM FLOOR TO

04:26:22.199 --> 04:26:24.735
SIX TIMES A WEEK FOR AT LEAST A

04:26:24.802 --> 04:26:26.403
TWO HOUR SESSION. AND I HIRED

04:26:26.470 --> 04:26:28.672
STAFF REALLY KNOW HOW TO COOK.

04:26:28.739 --> 04:26:32.343
FINALLY THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE

04:26:32.409 --> 04:26:34.044
IS NO LONGER APPROVAL NEEDED

04:26:34.111 --> 04:26:36.547
FROM A SUPERVISOR BECAUSE I AM

04:26:36.613 --> 04:26:38.849
IN CHARGE NOW IT IS VERY

04:26:38.916 --> 04:26:41.118
IMPORTANT TO ME THAT OTHERS HAVE

04:26:41.185 --> 04:26:42.786
THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES

04:26:42.853 --> 04:26:45.122
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SO MANY

04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:48.559
BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION THAT

04:26:48.625 --> 04:26:52.596
FEW HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENROLL.

04:26:52.663 --> 04:26:54.465
THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM

04:26:54.531 --> 04:26:56.333
FINALLY WENT STATEWIDE LAST

04:26:56.400 --> 04:26:59.670
JUNE. AFTER A VERY SLOW PHASING

04:26:59.737 --> 04:27:02.272
THE PROBLEMS AND BUREAUCRACY

04:27:02.339 --> 04:27:04.141
HAVE ONLY INCREASED. THERE IS NO

04:27:04.208 --> 04:27:06.243
CONSISTENCY BETWEEN REGIONAL

04:27:06.310 --> 04:27:08.245
CENTERS WITH LONG DELAYS AND

04:27:08.312 --> 04:27:09.546
STAFF PROVIDING HE WRONG

04:27:09.613 --> 04:27:12.149
INFORMATION WE CONTINUE TO HEAR

04:27:12.216 --> 04:27:13.784
OF REGIONAL CENTER STAFF

04:27:13.851 --> 04:27:15.386
DISCOURAGING CLIENTS AND

04:27:15.452 --> 04:27:17.054
FAMILIES FROM GOING INTO THE

04:27:17.121 --> 04:27:19.456
PROGRAM PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF

04:27:19.523 --> 04:27:24.828
COLOR. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

04:27:24.895 --> 04:27:26.330
INITIAL DATA SHOW THAT THE

04:27:26.397 --> 04:27:28.098
PROGRAM ACTUALLY REDUCING SOME

04:27:28.165 --> 04:27:30.367
OF THE SERVICE DISPARITIES THAT

04:27:30.434 --> 04:27:32.136
ACTUALLY THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM

04:27:32.202 --> 04:27:34.104
IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE PROFOUND

04:27:34.171 --> 04:27:36.340
INEQUITIES IN THE ENROLLMENT OF

04:27:36.407 --> 04:27:39.276
LATINOS INTO THE PROGRAM WHO ARE

04:27:39.343 --> 04:27:41.044
DRASTICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED.

04:27:41.111 --> 04:27:42.880
THE CRITICAL NATIONAL MANAGEMENT

04:27:42.946 --> 04:27:44.782
SERVICES HAVE FACED THEIR OWN

04:27:44.848 --> 04:27:46.717
BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS WITH WHO

04:27:46.784 --> 04:27:48.752
ALREADY LEAVING THE PROGRAM AND

04:27:48.819 --> 04:27:51.655
OTHERS PAUSING ACCEPTING NEW

04:27:51.722 --> 04:27:53.290
CLIENTS. THE WHOLE PROGRAM COULD

04:27:53.357 --> 04:27:55.626
GO INTO CRISIS UNLESS SOMETHING

04:27:55.692 --> 04:27:56.994
IS DONE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE

04:27:57.060 --> 04:27:59.163
ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB WITHOUT

04:27:59.229 --> 04:28:01.331
UNNECESSARY OBSTACLES. M. THE

04:28:01.398 --> 04:28:04.134

PERMANENT PERSON FOR THE JOB YET. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE THIS

04:28:16.280 --> 04:28:24.888

04:28:44.074 --> 04:28:46.043
HOPE THAT TGS WILL TAKE THESE

04:28:46.109 --> 04:28:47.845
RECOMMENDATIONS SERIOUSLY

COMPETENCY. FIRST LANGUAGE

04:29:36.627 --> 04:29:39.563
ACCESS IS A LEGAL RIGHT SO WE'RE

04:29:39.630 --> 04:29:41.598
GLAD THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE

04:29:41.665 --> 04:29:44.234
GETTING MORE FUNDING. AND LET'S

04:29:44.301 --> 04:29:46.203
NOT FORGET THAT LANGUAGE ACCESS

PROVIDE A SUPPORT FOR FREE. NO

04:30:32.382 --> 04:30:33.417
BECAUSE THE REGIONAL CENTER

04:30:33.483 --> 04:30:35.619
DECIDE IT KNOWS BETTER THAN THE

04:30:35.686 --> 04:30:37.688

REGIONAL TENSIONS THAT. ONE OF

04:30:47.130 --> 04:30:48.231

WHO NEED IT MOST. THIS PILOT

04:32:10.180 --> 04:32:12.683
PROJECT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO

04:32:33.070 --> 04:32:34.838
CONTEXT OF CAMP ESPECIAL

REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY HUGE

04:32:42.612 --> 04:32:44.314
STEP TOWARD REDUCING SOME OF THE

IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT. I HAVE

EXPERIENCED- HAVING REGIONAL

06:23:51.074 --> 06:23:55.178
CENTER- COORDINATORS TELL ME

AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS ON A

06:24:13.530 --> 06:24:16.600
POSITIVE NOTE IT IS THAT ONE OF

06:24:16.666 --> 06:24:19.403
THE- PARENTS TALKED ABOUT-

06:24:19.469 --> 06:24:20.737
FINDING SUPPORT THROUGH

LEADERSHIP. THE IT- IN OUR IN

06:24:26.977 --> 06:24:29.813
OUR LOCAL IN OUR GOVERNMENT OR

06:24:29.880 --> 06:24:32.249
IN OUR REGIONAL CENTERS BUT I

06:24:32.315 --> 06:24:33.483
THINK THE PARENTS ARE GOING TO

06:24:33.550 --> 06:24:35.752
HAVE TO MAKE A COALITION AND

06:24:35.819 --> 06:24:40.157
HAVE- I SHARING ONLINE AND

06:24:40.223 --> 06:24:42.893
PERHAPS MONTHLY LOCAL MEETINGS

06:24:42.959 --> 06:24:45.595
AND DO IT YOURSELF BECAUSE I

06:24:45.662 --> 06:24:48.298
DIDN'T GET ANY SERVICES IN O. T.

06:24:48.365 --> 06:24:50.734
SO I DID IT MYSELF I DIDN'T GET

06:24:50.801 --> 06:24:52.903
ANY SERVICES AND EDUCATION THREE

06:24:52.969 --> 06:24:54.704
OR FOUR YEARS OLD HE WAS TOO

06:24:54.771 --> 06:24:58.875
SMART DID IT MYSELF. AND I HAD

06:24:58.942 --> 06:25:00.811
TO GO THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF

06:25:00.877 --> 06:25:05.348
WITNESSING MY SON FALL BEHIND-

06:25:05.415 --> 06:25:07.918
FOUR YEARS IN SCHOOL AND BECOME

06:25:07.984 --> 06:25:10.887
A WORSE BEHAVIOR PROBLEM. AFTER

06:25:10.954 --> 06:25:13.089
WE SWITCHED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS

06:25:13.156 --> 06:25:14.958
AND WENT FROM HAVING A

06:25:15.025 --> 06:25:21.031
SUCCESSFUL. BEHAVIORAL SYSTEM-

06:25:21.097 --> 06:25:22.165
THAT WE USED AT HOME AND AT

06:25:22.232 --> 06:25:24.768
SCHOOL. AND THAN BEING

06:25:24.835 --> 06:25:27.737
CATEGORIZED AS AN STD CLIENT AND

06:25:27.804 --> 06:25:30.907
HE WASN'T. SO YOU HAVE SOMEBODY

06:25:30.974 --> 06:25:33.477
WHO IS ABOVE AVERAGE IN I. Q.

06:25:33.543 --> 06:25:37.881
VERBAL- NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE

06:25:37.948 --> 06:25:39.616
THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL LIKE CAR

06:25:39.683 --> 06:25:43.653
MECHANICS NO INVENTORY OF SKILLS

06:25:43.720 --> 06:25:46.056
. NO ADVOCACY FROM REGIONAL

06:25:46.122 --> 06:25:48.625
CENTER COORDINATORS WHO SAT IN

06:25:48.692 --> 06:25:50.227
ON MULTITUDINOUS I. E. P.

06:25:50.293 --> 06:25:53.830
MEETING- THESE ARE ALL THINGS

06:25:53.897 --> 06:25:57.701
THAT ARE DON'T TAKE ANYMORE REAL

06:25:57.767 --> 06:26:00.203
. GREAT EFFORT BUT IT WHAT

06:26:00.270 --> 06:26:03.306
OCCURS TO ME IS THAT SOMEONE-

06:26:03.373 --> 06:26:08.011
NEEDS TO DESIGN A SYSTEM. WHERE

06:26:08.078 --> 06:26:09.446
EVERYONE THE CHILDREN ARE

06:26:09.513 --> 06:26:12.816
MOTIVATED TO BEHAVE IF THEY HAVE

06:26:12.883 --> 06:26:14.684
A BEHAVIORAL SYSTEM OR THEY'RE

06:26:14.751 --> 06:26:17.354
MOTIVATED TO LEARN YES THEY

06:26:17.420 --> 06:26:20.790
HAVE- NEEDS AN EDUCATION. AND I

06:26:20.857 --> 06:26:23.426
WOULD GO TO A NON PROFIT OR A

06:26:23.493 --> 06:26:26.963
SCHOOL- THAT IS DOING IT OUTSIDE

06:26:27.030 --> 06:26:29.866
THE BOX I WOULD NOT LOOK AT WHAT

06:26:29.933 --> 06:26:31.668
THEY'RE DOING IN PUBLIC SCHOOL.

06:26:31.735 --> 06:26:35.171
BECAUSE IT'S JUST WAREHOUSING I

06:26:35.238 --> 06:26:37.007
WENT TO AN ORGANIZATION CALLED

06:26:37.073 --> 06:26:40.243
HANDLE H. A. N. D. ELLIE AND

06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:44.681
SEATTLE. AND THEY GAVE ME SOME

06:26:44.748 --> 06:26:46.516
THINGS TO WORK ON AT HOME AND

06:26:46.583 --> 06:26:48.351
FIGURED OUT THAT MY SON'S EYES

06:26:48.418 --> 06:26:50.720
DON'T WORK. LIKE EVERYBODY

06:26:50.787 --> 06:26:57.727
ELSE'S AND- ALSO DIAGNOSED HIM

06:26:57.794 --> 06:26:59.629
WITH OTHER THINGS THAT I HAD

06:26:59.696 --> 06:27:01.798
TROUBLE GETTING- MY SCHOOL

06:27:01.865 --> 06:27:08.405
DISTRICT TO. I UNDERSTAND- I

06:27:08.471 --> 06:27:10.407
THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE AT

06:27:10.473 --> 06:27:12.375
FIRST OF ALL A NARROW PSYCH

06:27:12.442 --> 06:27:14.511
ITSELF FOR THESE CHILDREN. AND

06:27:14.578 --> 06:27:16.680
IT SHOULD BE DONE BY SOMEBODY IN

06:27:16.746 --> 06:27:17.914
THE REGIONAL CENTER IT SHOULD

06:27:17.981 --> 06:27:19.683
NOT BE DONE AT THE SCHOOLS

06:27:19.749 --> 06:27:22.285
BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS. R. O. T.

06:27:22.352 --> 06:27:25.455
AND THEIR THEIR PSYCHOLOGIST

06:27:25.522 --> 06:27:27.924
THEY JUST THEY HAVE A VERY VERY

06:27:27.991 --> 06:27:29.726
LIMITED TIME AND THEY DON'T

06:27:29.793 --> 06:27:30.961
COORDINATE WITH THE TEACHERS AT

06:27:31.027 --> 06:27:34.264
ALL. SO IF THIS GUY IS GOING TO

06:27:34.331 --> 06:27:36.967
TAKE MORE MONEY. I SUPPORT THE

06:27:37.033 --> 06:27:40.036
ARCA LAW WHICH I HAD THE

06:27:40.103 --> 06:27:42.005
PLEASURE OF LISTENING TO ON

06:27:42.072 --> 06:27:45.175
SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY NINE-

06:27:45.241 --> 06:27:48.111
DEFINITELY DEFINITELY FOR

06:27:48.178 --> 06:27:50.180
SOMEBODY WHO IS A AVERAGE TO

06:27:50.246 --> 06:27:51.781
ABOVE AVERAGE IQ AND SOME OF

06:27:51.848 --> 06:27:53.516
THESE KIDS WHO THEY SAY CAN'T

06:27:53.583 --> 06:27:55.719
LEARN THEY CAN LEARN AND THERE

06:27:55.785 --> 06:27:56.953
ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THEM

06:27:57.020 --> 06:27:59.089
YOU JUST HAVE TO. ASK THE

06:27:59.155 --> 06:28:00.357
PARENTS WHAT DO YOUR CHILDREN

06:28:00.423 --> 06:28:02.525
LIKE TO DO I DEVISED A PROGRAM

06:28:02.592 --> 06:28:05.395
OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS FOR THE-

06:28:05.462 --> 06:28:07.864
PEDIATRIC THERAPY NETWORK AND

06:28:07.931 --> 06:28:10.000
THEY THEY WOULD ALL WE DID WAS

06:28:10.066 --> 06:28:12.869
DROP A HINT AS TO WHAT THE ALL

06:28:12.936 --> 06:28:15.138
THE BOYS COULD DO AND THESE ARE

06:28:15.205 --> 06:28:16.706
MOSTLY BOYS. THAT THEY HAVE ON

06:28:16.773 --> 06:28:18.608
THESE THESE PROGRAMS ON A WHY IT

06:28:18.675 --> 06:28:20.276
TOO IS THAT WHY THEY HAVE SO

06:28:20.343 --> 06:28:22.746
MANY BOYS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION

06:28:22.812 --> 06:28:26.483
HAS SOMETHING GENETIC ABOUT THAT

06:28:26.549 --> 06:28:29.052
- ANYWAY IT'S JUST SAD SO I

06:28:29.119 --> 06:28:30.787
WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW TO

06:28:30.854 --> 06:28:33.023
PARENTS DO IT YOURSELF UNTIL THE

06:28:33.089 --> 06:28:35.225
MONIES COME IN BUT THERE NEEDS

06:28:35.291 --> 06:28:37.127
TO BE BETTER ORGANIZATION THERE

06:28:37.193 --> 06:28:39.462
NEEDS TO BE LESS MEETINGS WHERE

06:28:39.529 --> 06:28:41.097
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE TO

06:28:41.164 --> 06:28:42.799
FILL OUT THIS THIS AND THIS AND

06:28:42.866 --> 06:28:44.067
WE'RE GOING TO GET SO AND SO ON

06:28:44.134 --> 06:28:45.869
BOARD AND IT'S ALL GOING TO BE

06:28:45.935 --> 06:28:48.204
GREAT BUT THERE'S NO TALK ABOUT

06:28:48.271 --> 06:28:50.440
WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN

06:28:50.507 --> 06:28:52.008
. THERE HAS TO BE HOW ARE YOU

06:28:52.075 --> 06:28:54.077
GOING TO DO THIS. YOU KNOW AND

06:28:54.144 --> 06:28:55.011
THE ACHIEVEMENT STANDARD

06:28:55.078 --> 06:28:58.682
SHOULDN'T BE. JOHNNY WILL HOLD-

06:28:58.748 --> 06:29:01.351
A RATE AND HE WILL LEARN HOW TO

06:29:01.418 --> 06:29:03.586
WATER PLANTS OUTSIDE. YOU KNOW

06:29:03.653 --> 06:29:05.121
THAT KIND OF THING THAT'S

06:29:05.188 --> 06:29:08.825
RIDICULOUS. I WOULDN'T THINK

06:29:08.892 --> 06:29:11.061
THAT ANYBODY ANY ADULT WOULD

06:29:11.127 --> 06:29:12.595
WANT TO WASTE HOURS OF THEIR

06:29:12.662 --> 06:29:14.397
TIME DURING THE WORKDAY WHICH MY

06:29:14.464 --> 06:29:17.067
HUSBAND DID HOURS FOUR HOURS IT

06:29:17.133 --> 06:29:19.636
EVERY MONTH FOR ALL OVER TWO

06:29:19.703 --> 06:29:22.439
YEARS ALMOST WE WERE IN AN IEP

06:29:22.505 --> 06:29:27.043
MEETING. AND- JUST YOU KNOW NO

06:29:27.110 --> 06:29:29.145
NO NO THE ONLY THING WE WANT TO

06:29:29.212 --> 06:29:32.882
DO IS TO COME INTO A- WAREHOUSE

06:29:32.949 --> 06:29:34.250
. YOU KNOW NON PUBLIC SCHOOL AND

06:29:34.317 --> 06:29:37.187
LET THEM DEAL WITH IT. AND WHAT

06:29:37.253 --> 06:29:38.054
DO THOSE PEOPLE DO THEY TEACH

06:29:38.121 --> 06:29:39.789
THEM A SKILL OKAY YOU

06:29:39.856 --> 06:29:42.525
COORDINATORS SKILLED WITH-

06:29:42.592 --> 06:29:45.395
LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM. IT'S

06:29:45.462 --> 06:29:47.464
LIKE HERE WE HAVE THESE CHILDREN

06:29:47.530 --> 06:29:48.164
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SO

06:29:48.231 --> 06:29:50.500
DIFFERENT. WHAT ARE THEY HOW ARE

06:29:50.567 --> 06:29:51.901
THEY LIKE THE REST OF THE

06:29:51.968 --> 06:29:53.970
POPULATION THAT'S HOW THIS ARC A

06:29:54.037 --> 06:29:56.139
