JUST WANT TO KIND OF MAKE A FEW

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:36.408
I LEVEL COMMENTS FIRST I THINK

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.776
IMPORTANT FOR THIS CONVERSATION

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:39.645
IS JUST A LITTLE CONTEXT FOR

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:40.512
THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:42.581
GOALS AND- WHERE WE'VE BEEN

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.583
WHERE WE ARE AND- WHERE WE'RE

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.785
GOING WHAT THEIR GOALS ARE- IN

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.787
PARTICULAR THE- AMBITIOUS

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.856
NATURE OF THE TWENTY THIRTY

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:52.558
GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS SO JUST

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:54.126
FOR CONTEXT. THE STATE HAS NOT

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:56.361
IT'S TWENTY TWENTY GREENHOUSE

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:58.330
GAS SCHOOLS A FEW YEARS EARLY-

00:19:58.397 --> 00:20:00.098
AND THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:03.535
SUCCESS- BUT I THINK JUST FOR

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:06.171
CONTEXT AGAIN THE ANNUAL

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:07.573
EMISSION REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:08.941
MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY GOALS

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.742
LAID OUT IN AB THIRTY TWO WERE

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:13.512
ROUGHLY 1% REDUCTIONS IN

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:16.181
EMISSIONS PER YEAR ANNUALLY-

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.350
WHEREAS THE TO MEET THE TWENTY

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:19.785
THIRTY GOAL IT'S CLOSER TO A

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:22.187
FOUR PERCENT- ANNUAL. EMISSIONS

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.189
REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO YOU TO

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:26.425
MEET THAT GOAL SO- THAT THE

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:27.593
GOALS ARE MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.328
KIND OF GOING UP TO TWENTY

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.530
THIRTY AND I THINK THE- ONE OF

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:32.197
THE OF COURSE THE MOST

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:33.532
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IN ONE THAT

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.333
YOU MIGHT EXPLORE IN THIS

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.667
HEARING IS WHAT IS THE NEXT OF

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:37.235
POLICIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:38.804
WANTS TO ADOPT IN ORDER TO.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.007
ACHIEVE THOSE AMBITIOUS GOALS-

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.508
AS YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS A

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:46.745
WIDE VARIETY OF- PROGRAMS-

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:49.281
REGULATORY PROGRAMS INCENTIVE

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:49.948
PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:52.184
STATE'S. ECONOMY WIDE CAP AND

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.119
TRADE PROGRAM AND SO SORTING

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.053
THROUGH SORT OF A MIX OF

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.188
PROGRAMS THAT ARE THIS MONTH

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:57.489
MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THOSE

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:59.324
GOALS AND ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:06.898
AFFECTED LEE IS VERY IMPORTANT-

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.433
IN IN AND KIND OF THAT. THAT

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.302
CONTEXT THINK- I ALSO WANTED TO

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:11.737
KNOW. AS PART OF TWENTY

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:12.604
SEVENTEEN SCOPING. THAT THE

00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.706
EVERY BOARD ADOPTED- IS A-

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.608
THEIR A GROWING. ROLE I DON'T.

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:17.843
FOR AND TRADE- TO MEET THE

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:20.045
TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS- I DON'T.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.980
BASIS IN TWENTY THIRTY NEARLY

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.015
HALF OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.983
WERE. IDENTIFIED TO COME FROM

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.353
CAP AND TRAD- AND SO. AS AN

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.789
OFFICE I FAILURE WE DO THINK-

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:32.257
RELYING ON CARBON PRICING AND

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:33.625
CAP AND TRADE IS A COST

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:35.360
EFFECTIVE WAY TO. REDUCE

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:36.695
EMISSIONS BUT THERE ARE NO

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:37.829
THERE ARE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:40.298
OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL AND SO

00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:42.067
WE THINK EXPLORING SORT OF THE

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:42.868
MIX OF CAP AND TRADE VERSUS

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:44.970
OTHER. POLICIES AND PROGRAMS IS

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:45.871
AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:47.673
LEGISLATURE AND I'M SURE THAT

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:49.941
WILL BE PART OF THIS HEARING-

00:21:50.008 --> 00:21:52.277
SO I THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:53.745
GET TO IS YOUR WHATEVER THE

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.614
LEGISLATURE DECIDES ON WHAT.

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:57.449
ROLE IT WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:21:57.516 --> 00:21:59.851
COUNTRY PLAY GOING FORWARD-

00:21:59.918 --> 00:22:01.453
JUST HAVING THE PROGRAM IN

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.923
PLACE IS NOT. NOT SUFFICIENT TO

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.091
ENSURE THE PROGRAMS ACHIEVING

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.959
THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:08.694
HOUSE WHERE OF THE STATE HAS

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.163
FOR IT SO- IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:11.897
THE PROGRAM THE DESIGN OF THE

00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:14.433
PROGRAM. MATTERS A LOT INSTEAD

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.934
I GETS TO THE SECOND POINT

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.203
THERE'S A LOT OF- A LOT OF

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.538
IMPORTANT DESIGN DECISIONS

00:22:19.604 --> 00:22:20.505
AROUND BUT CAP AND TRADE

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:22.307
PROGRAM AND HOW YOU'D LIKE TO

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:24.176
HAVE IT STRUCTURED- I'M GONNA

00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:25.977
HIGHLIGHT. ONE IN PARTICULAR AT

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:27.345
ONE THAT HAS AN ISSUE THAT HAS

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:28.947
BEEN AROUND FOR. A FEW YEARS

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.615
ESSENTIALLY SINCE THE EXTENSION

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:33.151
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH AB

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:33.719
THREE NINETY EIGHT SWITCHES

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:35.620
THE- OF THE OVERALL SUPPLY OF

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:36.988
ALLOWANCES THAT ARE OUT ON THE

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.590
MARKET AND WHAT'S KNOWN AS SORT

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:41.193
OF A BANK OF ALLOWANCES- AT. AS

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:43.061
MANY OF YOU KNOW ALLOWANCES CAN

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:44.529
BE KIND OF THAT ARE USED IN THE

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.264
PRIOR YEAR CAN BE HELD ONTO AND

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.733
BANKS AND USE FOR COMPLIANCE IN

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:50.469
THE FUTURE YEAR. AND THERE'S A

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:51.603
LOT OF GOOD REASONS TO HAVE

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.105
THAT DESIGN FEATURE IN THE

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:55.373
PROGRAM BUT AS RESULTS- IF

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.508
EMISSIONS ARE LOWER THAN THE

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:57.676
NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:58.844
OUT THERE IN THE INITIAL YEARS

00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.778
OF THE PROGRAM YOU CAN HAVE A

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:05.350
SITUATION. WHERE THERE'S A

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:05.984
LARGE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:06.651
ARE YOUR AVAILABLE TO USED. AND

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.620
YEAR. AND PA. THAT WHEN YOU GET

00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:11.289
OUT I. LATER OUT THIRTY LARGE.

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.691
ALLOW COULD BE USED TO COMPLY

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:15.026
WITH THE- THE PROGRAM AND AS

00:23:15.093 --> 00:23:17.095
RESULTS- THE STATE MIGHT NOT BE

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:19.831
CLOSE TO IT- AND THERE'S JUST A

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:20.665
MISSION TARGETS OUT TO TWENTY

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:23.268
THIRTY. SO I'M HAPPY TO KIND OF

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:24.269
EXPLORE THAT ISSUE IN A LITTLE

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:25.704
BIT MORE DETAIL BUT I JUST WANT

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:26.805
TO SORT OF WHY GET AS ONE KIND

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.774
OF. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AS IT

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.541
RELATES TO SORT OF THE

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:31.243
STRINGENCY OF THE PROGRAM.

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:32.277
WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SET UP IN

00:23:32.344 --> 00:23:33.912
A WAY THAT- SUFFICIENT AND

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:35.046
CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:23:35.113 --> 00:23:38.216
LEGISLATURES. OF GOALS OUT TO.

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:41.119
OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY- AND SO I

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:43.688
WILL KIND OF- MAYBE STOP MY

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.524
COMMENTS JUST. HIGHLIGHTING

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.527
THOSE COUPLE THINGS THERE- JUST

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:50.829

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:57.814
IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES ON THE

REGULATED ENTITIES IS NOT YET

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:03.921
NOW. KARBALA NEED TO COLLECT

PART OF THE NEXT COPING PLAN

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:12.696
UPDATE. AT THAT TIME IF

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:14.965
NECESSARY SCIENCE BASED AND

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:16.600
EVIDENCE DRIVEN CHANGES TO THE

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.468

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:21.138
EXAMINED. THIS IS THE STANDARD

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:22.673
PRACTICE AT HARPER COLLEGE

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:24.441
PROGRAM AND SINCE THE ADOPTION

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:26.243
OF THE CAP AND TRADE REGULATION

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.812
IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE

LAMENTED THE PROGRAM EIGHT

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:33.750
TIMES TO IMPROVE IT. MY KIDS

AND SAID ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:36.887
DESIGN AND PRICING BUT I THINK

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:38.488
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:41.491
CONTEXT OF ITS ADOPTION. IN TWO

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:42.759
THOUSAND AND SIX WHAT

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:45.028
CALIFORNIA PROPOSED WAS GROUND

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:47.097
BREAKING ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:49.299
AND NOW. THE EUROPEAN UNION'S

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:51.401
EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM WAS IN

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:54.538
ITS INFANCY. AND FOR THOSE WHO

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:56.073
WERE HERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.307
SIX MANY IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:59.243
EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERNS BUT

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:01.478
THE BROADER AB THIRTY TWO

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:02.379
PROGRAM CALLS FOR ENERGY THE

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:04.081
BALL. AND THAT THE CAP AND

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:06.149
TRADE PROGRAM RESULT WOULD

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:08.285
RESULT IN ECONOMIC RUIN FOR THE

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:11.088
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE

00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:12.856
CONTEXT OF THESE CONCERNS AND

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.425
THE RELATIVELY UNTESTED CONCEPT

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:16.193
OF A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.595
MARKET. HARD DEVELOP THE CAP

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:19.997
AND TRADE PROGRAM TO LIVE UP TO

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.331
THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:23.400
LEGISLATURE PUT IN STATUTE THAT

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:25.302
REMAIN IN EFFECT TODAY. THIS IS

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:27.537
FRANKLY THAT IT DIDN'T. CHANGE

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:30.474
COST EFFECTIVE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.643
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. AND WE

00:48:32.709 --> 00:48:34.611
CAN SEE THE RESULTS WE ACHIEVED

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:37.748
OUR TWENTY TWENTY CALL. IN

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:38.615
TWENTY SIXTEEN NOT ONLY WITHOUT

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.550
HARMING THE ECONOMY BUT AT

00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:41.718
SECRETARY BLUMENFELD

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:44.021
HIGHLIGHTED CALIFORNIA GROUP TO

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:45.322
THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:46.690
THE WORLD AND IT'S BECOME A

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:47.858
MAGNET FOR BUSINESSES

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:50.727
RESPONDING TO THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:52.195
LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:53.497
BUT I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSELL

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:54.831
THE CHALLENGE WE FACE AS WE

00:48:54.898 --> 00:48:57.534
LOOK TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY AND

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.169
TWENTY FORTY FIVE. MUCH OF OUR

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:00.504
REDUCTIONS HAVE COME FROM A

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.306
MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION IN THE

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:04.474
ENERGY SECTOR AWAY FROM FOSSIL

00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:06.877
FUELS TO RENEWABLES. AND THE

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.478
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS WHERE

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:10.447
WE MUST NOW SHIFT OUR FOCUS

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:11.815
SINCE IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:13.016
ROUGHLY HALF OF THE GREENHOUSE

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:15.352
GAS EMISSIONS. AND OVER 90% OF

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:17.187
THE HARMFUL DIESEL AIR

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:18.355
POLLUTION IN THE STATE.

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:19.523
TRANSITIONING CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.525
MASSIVE PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:23.327
VEHICLE FLEETS HE ZERO

00:49:23.393 --> 00:49:25.028
EMISSIONS WILL REQUIRE A

00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:26.830
DIFFICULT UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:29.299
OF EFFORT. BUT IT WILL BENEFIT

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:31.735
BOTH CLIMATE CHANGE AND AIR

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:34.171
QUALITY BECAUSE ZERO EMISSIONS

00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:36.440
AND ZERO EMISSION. I'D LIKE TO

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:37.974
CLOSE BY REITERATING MY

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:40.243

00:51:12.502 --> 00:51:14.337
IT'S IMPORTANT EMPHASIZE THIS

00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:16.239
PROGRAM IS ABOUT HALF OF THE

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:18.341
REDUCTIONS THAT ARE PLANNED. IN

00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:19.576
THE MOST RECENT SCOPING UNTIL

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:20.977
WE TALK ABOUT THE MIX OF

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.646
CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICIES

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.214
AND THERE ARE MANY AND MANY OF

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:25.515
THEM ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL HOW TO

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:26.683
TREAT IS FAR AND AWAY THE

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.652
BIGGEST IN TERMS OF THE PLANNED

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:30.086
ROLE FOR THE NEXT STAGE OF THE

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:32.255
CLIMATE POLICY PORTFOLIO- AND

00:51:32.322 --> 00:51:32.856
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:33.957
IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT

00:51:34.024 --> 00:51:35.125
AND GET THAT RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:36.393
NOT JUST SORT OF ONE AMONG

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.128
MANY. IT'S BY FAR THE BIGGEST

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:40.263
ELEMENT OF THAT PORTFOLIO- AND

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:41.198
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TALK

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:43.333
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT. IS A

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.701
QUESTION OF WHERE WE GO IN THE

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.169
FUTURE AND THE QUESTION I THINK

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:48.371
OF SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY TO TALK

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:50.607
THROUGH WHAT ALL OF THIS MEANS-

00:51:50.674 --> 00:51:51.908
I THINK A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.643
TALKING ABOUT HERE IS FRANKLY A

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.278
PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL DISCONNECT

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:56.179
ON THE WAY SOME OF THE

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:57.647
DECISIONS WERE MADE IN THE PAST

00:51:57.714 --> 00:52:01.384
ABOUT. HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:02.152
ROLE FOR THAT PROGRAM- AND I'M

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:03.753
I'M CONCERNED THAT IF WE REPEAT

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.722
THAT EXERCISE WITHOUT A DEEPER

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:07.190
COMMITMENT. TO SCIENTIFIC

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.492
INTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY WILL

00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:09.759
END UP IN A SIMILARLY

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:11.895
CONFLICTED POSITION- BUT I

00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:13.897
WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.899
REMARKS MADE. BY THE SECRETARY

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:18.134
AND THE NEW BOARD CHAIR. HAVE

00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:18.802
THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:20.504
INAPPROPRIATE. OF PUBLIC

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.605
REGULATORY PROCESS IN THE

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:22.539
FUTURE BECAUSE THAT IS HOW

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:23.940
CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO SHOW ITS

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:25.775
LEADERSHIP ON THESE ISSUES AND

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:26.343
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S JUST

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:27.811
CRITICAL IMPORTANT. BEFORE I

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.212
GET INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE TO

00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:30.814
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.449
ALSO WANT TO MENTION- I AM

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:34.551
OFTEN A SPEAKER YOU INVITE TO

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:35.519
SPEAK ABOUT CAP AND TRADE

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:36.686
ISSUES WHICH MEANS I DON'T GET

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:37.854
ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:39.556
COMMENCE THE BOARD- FOR THEIR

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.124
SUCCESS ON ISSUES LIKE THE

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.125
CLEAN TRUCKS ROLL IN MOBILE

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:43.360
SOURCE REGULATIONS WERE THINK

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.261
IT'S UNEQUIVOCAL THAT

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:45.395
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN OF THE

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:47.430
GLOBAL LEADERSHIP- FOR FRONT.

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:50.166
ON THESE ISSUES- NEVERTHELESS I

00:52:50.233 --> 00:52:51.434
THINK WE DO HAVE TO TALK OPENLY

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.602
AND FRANKLY ABOUT THE

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:53.837
PERFORMANCE OF THE CAP AND

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:57.140
TRADE PROGRAM GOING INTO THE

00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:58.408
NEXT SCOPING PLAN. THE FUNDING

00:52:58.475 --> 00:53:00.677
ISSUE- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS

00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:02.579
WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE TWENTY

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:03.313
SEVENTEEN SCOPE AND THE MOST

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.915
RECENT PLANNING DOCUMENT HOW

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:08.018
THE STATE IS GOING TO ACHIEVE-THE SB THIRTY TWO GOAL. WE SEE

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.719
NOT ONLY THIS MAJOR EMPHASIS ON

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:11.521
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. BUT

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:12.556
A DISCUSSION OF THE CAMPING

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:13.523
TRIP PROGRAM IS A WAY TO

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.225
ENSURE. THAT THE STATE WILL

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:16.393
ACHIEVE ITS GOALS BECAUSE IT

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:17.861
WILL PERFORM SOME SORT OF HARD

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:19.629
CAP LIKE FUNCTION AND REDUCE

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:22.165
EMISSIONS NO MATTER WHAT- WHEN

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.433
ONE LOOKS AT THE LANGUAGE AND

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.868
ANALYSIS IN THE SCOPE AND PLAN.

00:53:24.935 --> 00:53:26.403
AND COMPARES IT TO THE LANGUAGE

00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:28.004
AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN RULES I

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:28.638
THINK THERE'S A PRETTY

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.340
SIGNIFICANT DISCONNECT. IN HE

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:31.808
MODELING AND TECHNICAL WORK AND

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:33.143
ASSERTIONS THAT ARE MADE AS

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:34.978
BETWEEN THOSE TWO. POLICY

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:36.880
PROCESS HE'S NOT DISCONNECT

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.782
THANKS THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF

00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:39.549
THE TENSIONS WE TALKED ABOUT

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:42.218
TODAY- SO ONE OF THE THINGS I

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:43.119
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IN MY

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:44.354
TESTIMONY THIS MORNING IS THAT

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:45.522
THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:47.190
MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.658
WHERE I SERVED AS THE SENATE

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.127
APPOINTEE- ROADS PACIFIC WE ON

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:52.796
THIS ISSUE. AND I UNDERSTAND

00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:54.297
IT'S BEEN INCLUDED IN THE

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:54.965
BACKGROUND MATERIALS FOR

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.733
TODAY'S HEARING. I BRING THIS

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.268
UP BECAUSE THE BOARD HAS A

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:00.203
NUMBER OF CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.571
PROCEED WITH THE WAY IT THANKS

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:03.006
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IN THE

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:04.307
SCHOOL COMPOUND PROCESS AND

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:06.042
THEN IN ANY FUTURE REGULATORY

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:07.978
PROCESS USE THAT MY DEMAND THE

00:54:08.044 --> 00:54:09.613
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND THE

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:11.681
I AM ACT CHAPTER ADDRESSES SOME

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:12.649
OF THESE TENSIONS AND ISSUES

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:14.084
HISTORICALLY AND I HOPE IT'S

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.652
SOMETHING THAT THAT WE CAN WORK

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:17.120
THROUGH AND TALK ABOUT. BECAUSE

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:18.922
CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE SCOPING

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.690
PLAN. AND THE REGULATORY

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.759
PACKAGE- UNDERLYING THE CAP AND

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:24.461
TRADE PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL TO

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:26.029
MEET WHATEVER SET OF GOALS AND

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:28.198
DECISIONS. THAT THIS

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:28.765
ADMINISTRATION AND THE BOARD

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.900
WANTS TO TAKE- SO I THINK

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.402
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT AREA

00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:33.637
TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE POTENTIAL

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:35.472
FOR CONSISTENCY TO RESOLVE SOME

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:37.674
OF THESE TENSIONS. I WANT TO

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.442
ADD THAT. IN A COUPLE OF THE

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:40.210
THINGS I'VE HEARD MAY BE

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:46.082
RELEVANT FOR THE COMMITTEE'S.

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:46.650
CONSIDERATION THE- QUESTION

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:47.517
ABOUT WHETHER THE PRO IS FOR.

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:50.086
WELL IS AN- AND TECHNO CONTRA-

00:54:50.153 --> 00:54:51.221
I MEAN THAT'S I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:52.422
MEANS IT'S ALSO FREQUENTLY

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:54.290
SOMEWHAT DELTA FOLKS. AND

00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:56.693
SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED- PART OF

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.894
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THERE

00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:59.596
AREN'T VERY CLEAR TECHNICAL

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:01.564
METRICS TO TRACK PROGRAM. AND

00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:02.866
THE I MAC AMONG OTHERS HAVE

00:55:02.932 --> 00:55:03.967
RECOMMENDED THAT THE AIR

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:05.235
RESOURCES BOARD PRODUCE THESE

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:06.403
KINDS OF METRICS WHICH ARE

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:07.837
STANDARD AND OTHER CAP AND

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.105
TRADE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:11.241
EAST COAST REGGIE PROGRAM. AS

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:12.308
WELL AS THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:14.344
EUROPEAN UNION PROGRAM. ALL

00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:16.246
THESE METRICS TO TRACK THE

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.147
QUESTION OF THE NUMBER OF

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:18.748
OUTSTANDING ALLOWANCES AND ALSO

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.316
TO THE PROGRAM. INDEED THE

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:21.818
RESOURCES FORTY ONE HAS SUCH A

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.153
METRIC FOR THE LOW CARBON FUEL

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:25.288
STANDARD BUT- FOUR YEARS HAS

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.323
BEEN. UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:28.925
PRODUCE SUCH A METRIC FOR THE

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.527
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. YEAH I

00:55:30.593 --> 00:55:31.828
AM ACT DEVELOPED A METHOD I

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:32.696
PUBLISHED A PEER REVIEWED

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.197
SCIENTIFIC PAPER TO SHOW HOW IT

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:35.432
COULD BE DONE. WE HAVEN'T

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:37.333
REALLY HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HOW

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:37.867
THE BOARD MIGHT CONSIDER

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:39.569
POSITIONS. AND I MENTION THIS

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:41.104
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:42.238
TRACK WHAT'S GOING ON IF YOU'RE

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:43.339
GONNA HAVE TO USE EVIDENCE

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:44.841
BASED. BASED METHODS TO FIGURE

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:45.909
OUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:47.610
IS DOING WHAT WE WANTED TO DO.

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:48.445
AND I THINK THERE'S A REALLY

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.880
IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO AIM

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:52.649
FOR A HIGHER BAR IN THE CYCLE-

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:54.084
AND USE EVIDENCE TO GUIDE SOME

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.518
OF THESE DECISIONS BECAUSE FROM

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.120
MY POINT OF VIEW THAT IS. NOT A

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:58.388
FAIR DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY

00:55:58.455 --> 00:55:59.923
THINGS WENT DOWN PREVIOUSLY.

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:01.324
AND THAT IS NOT A COMMENT WITH

00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:03.860
RESPECT TO. THE NEW LEADERSHIP

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:08.364
OF CALLIE PA AND THE NEW. CHAIR

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:10.533
BOARD. I THINK. THE OTHER.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.268
COUPLE THINGS TO MENTION BRIEF-

00:56:12.335 --> 00:56:14.204
RESOLUTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:15.205
PREMIER RESOURCES BOARD

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.040
COMMITTED THE STAFF TO PRODUCE

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:19.109
AN ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER OF

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:20.744
ALLOWANCES THAT ARE BANKS-

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.011
AFTER THE PROGRAM'S TWENTY

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:24.080
TWENTY. COMPLIANCE PERIOD. OF

00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:26.216
COMPLETES. AND THAT ANALYSIS IS

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:27.517
DUE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR SO

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:29.152
WE WILL PRESUMABLY HAVE SOME

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.887
FORMAL PUBLIC STATEMENT FROM

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:32.822
THE BOARD ON THESE METRICS. ARE

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:33.823
WHERE I THINK WE ARE GOING TO

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.024
SEE THAT THE NUMBER OF BANKS

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:36.826
ALLOWANCES IS FAR IN EXCESS OF

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:37.994
WHAT THE BOARD SAID IN ITS

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:39.295
PREVIOUS WERE MAKING STATEMENT

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:39.963
I THINK THAT WILL BE AN

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:43.099
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS. SOME OF

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:44.467
THE CHALLENGES IN THIS PROGRAM-

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:45.435
THE LAST THING I WANT TO

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:47.737
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT. BOTH THE

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:49.572
SECRETARY AND THE NEW BOARD

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:51.174
CHAIR REFERENCE THE IDEA THAT

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.442
THE A BETWEEN NINETY

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:54.110
REGULATIONS TOOK EFFECT JUST

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:56.513
SIX WEEKS AGO- THIS IS TRUE AS

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.348
A MATTER OF LAW THE REGULATIONS

00:56:58.414 --> 00:56:59.516
TOOK EFFECT IN JANUARY OF THIS

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:00.884
YEAR. BUT OF COURSE THEY WERE

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.852
FINALIZED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:03.453
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.821
THIS BECAUSE I THINK EVERY

00:57:04.888 --> 00:57:05.922
SINGLE PARTICIPANT IN THE

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:07.257
MARKET HAS BEEN TRADING ON THE

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:08.525
BASIS OF THOSE PERFECTLY

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.027
UNDERSTOOD REGULATIONS. SINCE

00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:11.494
THOSE REGULATIONS WERE

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:13.596
COMPLETED. SO WELL IT MAKES

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:15.865
VERY GOOD SENSE. TO BE CAUTIOUS

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.567
AND THOUGHTFUL AND THE MARKET

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:18.268
REGULATOR'S ROLE AS A

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.936
FIDUCIARY. I THINK IT'S ALSO

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:21.271
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE RULES AND

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:22.539
PERFORMANCE OF THE MARKET HAS

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:23.473
BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR TO EVERYBODY

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.908
PARTICIPATING IN THE LAST

00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:27.544
SEVERAL YEARS- AND THAT I DON'T

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.279
THINK IS A- GOOD REASON TO-

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:30.747
TALK ABOUT DEFERRING. A MORE

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.582
DETAILED CONVERSATION ON WHAT

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:34.484
SHOULD BE DONE- IF INDEED.

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:36.719
THERE IS POTENTIALLY AN ISSUE

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:38.354
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN

00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:40.757

CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.889
CARBON AND WILL MOSTLY FOCUS

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.625
TODAY'S BEEN ON. EMISSIONS

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:59.528
DRIVE FROM TRANSPORTATION AND

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:00.096
WE DON'T REALLY TAKE INTO

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:02.231
CONSIDERATION THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.734
A HUGE AMOUNT OF CARBON-

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.003
RELEASE FROM FOREST FIRE. AND

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.137
SO IT'S BEEN ONE OF MY PET

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:10.106
PEEVES I'VE I TALK ABOUT ALL

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:12.108
THE TIME AND I TYPICALLY GET.

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:14.443
ALVO DID. MOSTLY ON MOST

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.646
COMMITTEES I SAID ON- MAYBE

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:17.413
IT'S BECAUSE I'M I'M IN A

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.482
DIFFERENT- LOOK THOUGHT PROCESS

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:21.884
I GUESS. BUT WHAT I WANTED TO

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:24.220
SAY IS THAT. WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:26.088
HOLISTICALLY AT OR CARBON

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.790
OUTPUT BECAUSE AT THE END OF

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.992
THE DAY WE CAN DO ALL KINDS OF

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.827
THINGS THAT AND I WANT TO SHARE

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:33.763
ALSO THAT. I'M A FARMER. AS

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:35.264
FOOD FOR PEOPLE EAT THAT I'M

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:36.365
I'M PRETTY SURE EVERYBODY HAS

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.034
TO HAVE THAT MOSTLY EVERY DAY.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.568
EXCEPT IN THAT TO AND I COMPETE

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:41.704
WITH COMPANIES THAT. AND FARMS

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.706
THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.508
STRUGGLING. I'LL JUST BE HONEST

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:46.509
WITH YOU ALSO HAVE A TRUCKING

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:48.311
BUSINESS. AND I'VE BEEN

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.112
IMPACTED BY I BELIEVE THE

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:52.448
BIGGEST TAX PUT ON CALIFORNIA'S

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:55.084
INDUSTRY. WHICH WAS AB THIRTY

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.352
TWO NOW I WANT TO SHARE WITH

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:57.987
YOU THAT I AM ALL FOR.

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.388
CARBONITE I THINK WE SHOULD

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.824
REDUCE OUR- CARBON FOOTPRINT I

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:02.591
THINK WE SHOULD REDUCE

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:03.993
POLLUTION I THINK THAT THE

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.395
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN COMMUNITIES

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:06.962
THAT ARE IMPACTED I WANT TO

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.731
HELP THEM. BUT I THINK IT'S HOW

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.467
WE GO ABOUT IT. IT'S THE

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:13.235
PRIORITY OF HOW WE SPEND THE

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.570
DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:18.207
BASICALLY TAXED OR ARE FORCED

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:20.643
TO PAY FOR THEIR MISSIONS. AND

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.645
I BROUGHT UP SEVERAL TIMES IN

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:24.013
AND I THINK THE PUBLIC IS

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.082
CATCHING ON TO THIS STUFF. BUT

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:28.284
THE FACT THAT WE SPEND. HUGE

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:29.552
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS ON

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:30.753
TRANSPORTATION A TRAIN THAT

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.555
WE'RE BUILDING THAT I'VE IN MY

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:33.122
MIND I BELIEVE WILL NEVER BE

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:35.858
COMPLETED. AND THAT'S THAT'S

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.660
THE FRUSTRATION AND I HEARD- MR

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.595
BLUMENFELD SAY THAT YOU KNOW

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:40.629
THE CONNIE GREW BY TWENTY SIX

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:43.232
PERCENT. AND WE'RE LEADING THE

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.768
WORLD AND HOW WE DO. YOU KNOW

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.370
CARBON REDUCTION BUT I'D LIKE

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.572
TO KNOW WHERE THE ECONOMY GREW

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:51.474
DID IT GROWTH PACIFIC LEE FROM.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.909
OUR CARBON GOALS OR DID IT GROW

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:56.679
BECAUSE WE HAVE A- AND MEGA

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:59.181
AMOUNT OF WORLD CORPORATIONS

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:02.651
THAT PAY. IN CAPITAL GAINS TAX

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:03.953
THAT'S IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:05.821
BUDGET AND FIND OUT WHERE THE

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:06.622
MONEY COMES FROM THERE

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.191
ACTUALLY- THAT HE PUT OUT A

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:11.494
REPORT THAT SEVEN THOUSAND

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.162
EIGHT HUNDRED TAXPAYERS PAID

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:14.563
60% OF OUR TAXES AND THOSE ARE.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:17.032
VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE IN

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:18.334
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE GETTING

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.070
CAPITAL GAINS SO I'M VERY MUCH

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:23.239
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMY-

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:27.476
AND THE LONG TERM- LOOKING OF-

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.311
THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THE

01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:32.081
DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE HERE.

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:34.116
AND SO I THAT'S THE COMMENT I

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:36.819
WANT TO MAKE AYE AYE I WOULD

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.155
LIKE TO KNOW. YOU KNOW. I THINK

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.756
THAT WAS THE PROFESSOR THAT

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.659
SAID EVIDENCE BASED POLICY. AND

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.061
THE MATRIX IS VERY IMPORTANT IN

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:46.662
TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'M GONNA BE

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.164
LOOKING THIS MATRIX WE DON'T

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.465
COULD WILDFIRE WE'RE LYING TO

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:51.333
OURSELVES IS SAYING HEY WORRY

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.401
REDUCE EMISSIONS WERE NOT WE

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:54.570
BURKE FOUR MILLION EIGHT. FOUR

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:55.137
POINT TWO MILLION ACRES LAST

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:57.239
YEAR. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:59.809
ACRES EVERY YEAR. PAST THAT AND

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.744
WE'RE GONNA BURN MORE AND WE

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:04.046
KEEP TALKING ABOUT.

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:05.181
TRANSPORTATION WHEN WE AND I

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.749
KNOW WE THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:10.119
FORCE. BY LEGISLATION SB NINE

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:11.654
ONE WHICH I WAS A BIG PLAYER IN

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.088
TO GET T DONE TO ACTUALLY DO

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:14.890
SOMETHING IN CARBON REDUCTION

01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:16.792
ON FUELS. AND I'VE SAID IT IN

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.561
THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER. LOOK

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:19.762
THERE'S THREE THINGS THAT CAUSE

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:22.031
WILDFIRE OXYGEN IGNITION AND

01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:26.635
FUEL. IF THE ONE THING WE CAN

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.237
CONTROL IS FUEL WE NEED TO

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:29.772
REDUCE THE FUEL LOADING IN OUR

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.941
WATERSHEDS. IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:33.943
REDUCE CARBON AND IF NOT IT

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:35.611
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:38.214
WE'RE GONNA BURN. SO I'M ON

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.615
BOARD I THINK THE WAY WE DO IT

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:41.383
IS THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE NEED

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.118
TO FOCUS ON GETTING TAKING CARE

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:44.820
OF OUR WATERSHEDS WHICH IS OUR

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:46.322
WILL OUR QUOTE WATER QUALITY IN

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:47.923
OUR WILDLIFE IS PROTECTED WHEN

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:50.059
WE DO THAT AS WELL. I WANTED TO

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.861
TOUCH ON ONE LAST THING AND

01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:53.362
THEN I'LL BE HAPPY TO SEE.

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.064
LISTEN BACK ABOUT WHAT'S IT AND

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.399
I THINK IT'S WRONG THAT WE HAVE

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.268
THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT ARE.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.036
ARE WHICH I THINK RUN

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:02.338
CONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE STATE

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:03.572
OF EMERGENCY THE GOVERNOR'S

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:06.575
DONE EXECUTIVE ORDERS. TO GET

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.077
US TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WITH

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:10.613
ALL ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES.

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:13.883
THAT'S GREAT NO PROBLEM BUT HOW

01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:15.284
WE GONNA GET THERE AND STILL

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.819
HAVE AN ECONOMY AT THE END OF

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:17.753
THE DAY HOW MY GONNA RUN MY

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.321
FORM AND HOW MY NEIGHBOR'S

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:21.924
GONNA RUN THEIR FARMS ON ZERO

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:22.958
MISSION IF ISSUES BY TWENTY

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:24.727
THIRTY FIVE. TELL ME HOW WE'RE

01:09:24.793 --> 01:09:26.095
GOING TO GET THERE AND THEN.

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:26.996
I'LL DECIDE WHETHER I'M GONNA

01:09:27.062 --> 01:09:28.163
STAY IN CALIFORNIA OR NOT

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.398
BECAUSE OF A LOT OF BUSINESSES

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:30.299
OUT THERE THEY'RE GOING IS A

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:31.367
GREAT IDEA AND EVERY FEELS GOOD

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.135
ABOUT IT. WE DO POLICY AROUND

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:35.037
HERE ON FEELING GOOD NOT.

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.106
FACTUAL MATRIX WHICH I HEARD.

01:09:37.172 --> 01:09:40.476
IN EVIDENCE BASED POLICIES.

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:42.545
IT'S ALL BE CRITICAL OF THOSE

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:45.681
WE ASKED. SHARE NICHOLS FIVE

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:47.016
YEARS AGO WHAT ABOUT FOREST

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:49.451
FIRES AND YOUR ANSWER WAS

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:50.019
THAT'S A NATURAL DISASTER WE

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:52.588
DON'T COUNT THAT. THAT'S WRONG

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.189
I'M BREATHING NOT SMOKE EVERY

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.691
YEAR AND SEWER ALL THE

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:56.458
CONSTITUENTS OUT THERE AND

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:57.126
THEY'RE GETTING TIRED OF

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.460
HEARING HEY WE'RE GOING TO DO

01:09:58.527 --> 01:09:59.495
SOMETHING BUT ALL THEY'RE DOING

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:00.863
IS REGULATING THIS AREA. AND

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:03.499
NOT FOCUSING ON A HUGE EMITTER.

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:05.167
AND ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.869
SPENDING MONEY ON THE TRAINING

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.404
THAT DOESN'T GET US ANYTHING

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:09.672
AND IT'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS I

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:11.307
THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA THE

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:12.141
PEOPLE ARE GONNA WAKE UP TO

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:15.578
THIS I HOPE. AND THROW PEOPLE

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:16.178
OUT OFFICE THAT ARE MAKING BAD

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.813
DECISIONS. AGAIN I WANT TO CAP

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.214
OFFICE SAYING IN CLOSING THAT I

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:22.585
AM FOR. A GOOD SOLID CLIMATE

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:25.220
POLICY THAT MAKES SOME SENSE

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:25.788
THAT ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:28.390
THAT HELPS. CALIFORNIANS

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:29.892
BREATHE CLEANER AND WE STOP

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:30.859
EMITTING IF WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:31.894
THE LEADER IN THE WORLD AND

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.062
MUST BE THE LEADER IN THE RIGHT

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:34.029
WAY AND LET'S BE TRANSPARENT

COUPLE PLAN PROCESS. I DON'T

01:16:43.598 --> 01:16:44.766
THINK ONE CAN TALK ABOUT CARBON

VIEW BUT I DO THINK EVENTUALLY

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:07.756
THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE TO

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:11.293

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:26.668
AND- I THINK THIS REGULATION

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:28.603
GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION BUT I

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:30.806
APPRECIATE THE THAT THE LAST

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.008
DISCUSSION ON THE ZERO EMISSION

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:34.476
VEHICLE PIECE AND SOME OF OUR

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:37.145
TRANSPORTATION GOALS THAT-

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.380
REALLY ARE VERY DIFFERENT

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:39.714
FUNCTION IN THE CAP AND TRADE

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:42.384
PROGRAM AND- AND I DON'T THINK

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:43.151
THERE'S GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:46.588
ORDER. HAS RECEIVED NEARLY- THE

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:52.861
ATTENTION- OR- OR FOCUS THAT IT

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:56.264
DESERVES IN THAT. AT THE TRAP.

01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:59.901
RIGHT NOW. FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:00.836
AND FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING IN

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:03.472
POVERTY IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:05.941
WITH THE TRAP THAT THEY'RE IN

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:08.510
WITH THEIR VEHICLE FOR DRIVERS

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.845
FOR SUPER COMMUTERS AROUND THE

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:11.780
STATE FOR WORKING PEOPLE WHO

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:12.347
ARE STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:15.117
PANDEMIC- YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:19:15.183 --> 01:19:17.519
SPENDING MORE THAN HALF THEIR

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:18.920
INCOME SOME OF THE DATA WE'VE

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:20.989
BEEN LOOKING AT. SHOWS THAT

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:23.024
HOUSEHOLD SPENDING MORE ON

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:24.860
TRANSPORTATION THEN FOOD AND

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:27.062
HEALTH CARE COMBINED RIGHT IN

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.730
THE HEART OF A PANDEMIC YOUR

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:31.233
SPENDING NO INCOME DISPOSABLE

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:32.434
INCOME OR TAKING THEIR EDT

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.035
CHECK AND THEN HAVING TO BUY

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:37.439
GAS AND FIX THEIR CAR TO GET

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:40.542
AROUND KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.511
THE TRANSPORTATION IS TRULY A-

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.746
JUST LIKE POWER AT A MATTER OF

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.648
LIFE AND DEATH FOR MANY PEOPLE

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:49.284
AND I THINK IT UNDERESTIMATES

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.619
WHEN WE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:54.422
GOALS AT I. JUST WANT TO. POINT

01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:56.424
OUT THAT THIS TRANSPORTATION

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:58.560
EMPHASIS THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:01.096
AND FOCUSING ON CALIFORNIA'S A

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:05.100
MARKET MOVER IS NOT A NEW THING.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:06.868
HI YOU KNOW BACK IN TWO

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.203
THOUSAND TWO THERE IS A BILL

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:10.305
CALLED AB FOURTEEN NINETY THREE

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:12.307
THAT SAID THERE RESOURCES BOARD

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:14.042
SHOULD EXPLORE ALL COST

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:15.443
EFFECTIVE IN TECHNOLOGICALLY

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:17.579
FEASIBLE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.414
FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:21.650
FROM THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR. FOR

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:24.252
LIGHT DUTIES PARTICULARLY AND-

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.521
NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:27.656
ELECTRIC F. ONE FIFTY COMING

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:30.492
OUT. THEY CAN PULL LIKE FIFTY

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:34.529
TRAIN CARS OF TORQUE AND- THE-

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.865
VERY POLITE TO THE SECTOR IS

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:39.801
GOING TO BE- ACCESSIBLE BY A

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:42.103
WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF MIDDLE

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:45.740
CLASS AMERICANS AND- YOU KNOW

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.242
WHEN YOU HAVE A- MONTHLY

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:50.278
VEHICLE BUDGET. SAY TWENTY FIVE

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.747
OR THIRTY DOLLARS TO FILL UP

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:55.283
YOUR CAR AND MAINTAINING. FORTY

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:57.586
DOLLARS VERSUS. FIVE HUNDRED

01:20:57.652 --> 01:20:59.754
DOLLARS ARE YOU FUNDAMENTALLY

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.823
CHANGE THE ECONOMICS OF.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.658
HOUSEHOLDS IN THIS STATE SO I

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.527
ACTUALLY THINK IT'S A POVERTY

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.795
FIGHTING TOOL AND I THINK IT

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:09.231
WILL UNLOCK PEOPLE'S DISPOSABLE

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:10.532
INCOME TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:13.401
HEALTH AND THEIR KIDS- AND I. I

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:15.270
REALLY WANT TO KEEP OUR

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:17.072
OURSELVES FOCUSED ON THAT IN

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:20.842
THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR AS WE

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:22.510
LOOK AT THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS.

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:24.012
ANYTHING MY BIGGEST CONCERN

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:26.114
HERE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:27.115
ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN AMBITIOUS

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:28.617
ENOUGH. AND THAT THIS

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.385
ADMINISTRATION IS DOING WHAT IT

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:32.420
CAN TO MOVE THE PUSH THE

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:35.056
ENVELOPE. AND TO RESPOND WITH.

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:37.626
WITH URGENCY- ON THINGS LIKE

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:40.462
SAID CERTAIN NO ONE TARGETING

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:41.663
CARBON NEUTRALITY IS A LONG

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.164
TERM GOAL BUT ALSO UNITE I

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.834
DON'T THINK. CARBON NEUTRALITY

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.569
IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH. AND I

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:50.438
FRANKLY THINK IT'S- A BIT OF AN

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:53.875
ARBITRARY. GOAL GETTING TO ZERO

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:55.710
SOUNDS GOOD OR YOU KNOW

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:58.113
NEUTRALITY I GUESS SORT OF THIS

01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:02.851
TAKEN HOLD BUT IF YOU. IF THE-TRUE GOAL IS TO REVERSE THESE

01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:06.054
TRENDS AND TRY TO KEEP THESE

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:07.789
FOREST FROM BURNING AS- A

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:10.258
CENTER DOLLY SO. APTLY POINTED

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:14.029
OUT AND YOU KNOW IN OUR MY

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:15.130
COMMUNITIES BURNED TO AN- ARE

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:17.632
WE LOST A LOT OURSELVES. BUT IF

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.034
WE CAN ACTUALLY REVERSE OUR

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.203
HISTORIC TRENDS. AND GET TO A

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:24.072
PLACE OF CLIMATE RESTORATION.

01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:25.674
FORGET NEUTRALITY BUT ACTUALLY

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.542
GET TO NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.445
START REMOVING CARBON DIOXIDE

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:31.012
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO CATCH UP

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:32.747
IT'S GOING TO BE TOO LATE. NO

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:33.982
STATE'S GOING TO BE ON FIRE

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:36.117
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. SO

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:38.887
I YOU KNOW. I DO WANT TO SORT

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:41.990
OF POINT OUT THAT. THE DANGER

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:42.991
IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IS

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:45.393
TO. IS TO JUST SPEND TIME SORT

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:48.263
OF. LOOKING FOR HOLES IN

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.533
CRITICIZING BUT NOT TO TAKE BIG

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:53.735
LEAPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE. THE

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.670
SET IS THE MINISTRATIONS TARGET

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.806
ON A FURTHER HORIZON AND IF

01:22:57.872 --> 01:22:59.874
THIS BY ADMINISTRATION IS

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.009
ACTUALLY GONNA OUTPACE

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:03.244
CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF SETTING

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:06.181
ITS ITS TARGETS AND AMBITIONS-

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:07.515
WE'VE GOT SOME CATCHING UP TO

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:11.086
DO EUROPE IS IT 55% BELOW

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:13.188
NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. BY

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:14.956
TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE ONLY A 40%

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:17.392
OUR GOALS ARE MUCH LESS THAN

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:19.494
THE U. K. AND MANY OTHER.

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:21.496
NATIONS ARE ACTUALLY WITH

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:23.865
SMALLER SMALLER AGGREGATE

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:27.369
ECONOMIES IN OURS PERHAPS- BUT

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:29.571
BUT COLLECTIVELY THE E. U. FOUR

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:33.007
DOOR SARS- SO I'M I'M CONCERNED

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.409
THAT THE PLANNING EXERCISE

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:36.478
GOING ON RIGHT NOW FRANKLY IS

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:38.012
NOT AMBITIOUS ENOUGH AND THAT

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:40.181
THE MODELING EFFORTS. UNDER WAY

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.383
THEY WILL DRIVE THIS SCOPING

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:44.786
PLAN. ARE GOING TO SORT OF

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.855
SHOOT FOR. I YOU KNOW THESE

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:48.857
THESE THESE NUMBERS WE'VE

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.125
CHOSEN AND LORET EXECUTIVE

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:53.128
ORDER BUT NOT PURSUE ALL COST

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.630
EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGICALLY

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:58.800
FEASIBLE GOALS- SOME WONDERING

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:02.570
IF EITHER L. A. O. OR AND MAYBE

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:05.974
AND THE ADMINISTRATION CAN CAN

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:10.378
COMMENT ON. HOW HOW MUCH WE'RE

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:11.446
POTENTIALLY LEAVING ON THE

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:15.884
TABLE RIGHT NOW- IF WE DON'T

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:19.354
PLAN BIG IF WE IF WE SORT OF

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:20.855
INCREMENTALLY INVEST FOR

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:24.626
INSTANCE RIGHT NOW- AND ANY

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:26.628
SORT OF JUST PLAN FOR THAT

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:29.564
FORTY PERCENT. BUT DON'T GO

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:32.367
BEYOND IT- IS THERE A RISK THAT

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:36.805
WE LEAVE A NUMBER OF COST

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:39.474
EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS- ON THE

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:40.975
TABLE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAY

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.510
ALREADY FIND TO BE COST

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:43.778
EFFECTIVE BUT WE'RE NOT

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:46.915
PURSUING THEM. WHO'D LIKE TO

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.249
TAKE THE FIRST CRACK AT THAT

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:51.319
I'M I'M REMINDED OF- THE END OF

01:24:51.386 --> 01:24:53.855
PROFESSOR CALLING WERE WORDS

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.256
BOOK THAT SAID YOU KNOW DEEP

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:57.892
CARBONIZATION MUST BE EARNED

01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:59.427
THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. THROUGH

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:02.063
INDUSTRIAL POLICY INVESTMENT

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:05.567
EXPERIMENTATION AND SCALING OUR-

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:06.801
THUNDERSTORM RAISES A GOOD

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:09.270
POINT POINT ABOUT AMBITION AND

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:11.406
THIS THE CRITIQUE THAT SOME

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:12.040
PEOPLE DON'T THINK WE'LL GET TO

01:25:12.106 --> 01:25:13.975
MAKE THE FORTY PERCENT. FIFTY A

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:15.643
TARGET THAT WE HAVE THAT'S

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:17.512
THAT'S LESS THAN EUROPEANS.

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:20.748
LET'S SEE. WHO'S WAVING THEIR

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:23.251
HAND- MR SHARE THIS IS ROSS

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:24.919
FROM LA I CAN KIND OF TAKE A

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:28.289
STEP AND I RESPONDED TO SOME OF

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:28.923
THOSE COMMENTS THAT'S OKAY WITH

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:31.759
YOU- YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:33.428
KNOW. A LOT OF THE COMMENTS HE

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:35.196
MADE SENATOR STERN REALLY SORT

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:36.531
OF RELATE TO YOU KNOW THE

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:38.399
LEGISLATURE'S GOAL AND SORT OF

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.134
WHAT WHAT TYPES OF AMBITIONS

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:41.736
THE LEGISLATURE HAS FOR SORT OF

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.404
ITS LONG TERM CLIMATE GOALS WE

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:44.272
HAVE THAT AS YOU MENTIONED THAT

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:46.774
TWENTY THIRTY. GOAL IN

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:49.611
STATUTES- I THINK THERE ARE

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:50.578
KIND OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.313
ABOUT YOU KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.848
DOES THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:55.383
KIND OF THOSE LONGER TERM GOALS

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:56.684
AND HOW AMBITIOUS DOESN'T WANT

01:25:56.751 --> 01:25:58.853
TO BE OUT OF TWENTY THIRTY BUT

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.255
ALSO SORT OF BEYOND THAT. AND

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:01.322
DEPENDING ON KIND OF WHERE YOU

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:03.024
STAND ON I'M KIND OF THAT LEVEL

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:05.360
OF AMBITION. IT CAN MAKE A BIG

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:06.828
DIFFERENCE AND SORT OF WHAT

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.663
TYPES OF POLICIES YOU MIGHT.

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:09.931
WANT TO ADOPT IN ORDER TO

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:11.733
ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS SO. YOUNG

01:26:11.799 --> 01:26:14.102
MID TERM TARGET YOU KNOW MIGHT-

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:16.004
UP TO TWENTY THIRTY- YOU MIGHT

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:17.405
KIND OF LOOK AT A CERTAIN SET

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:18.673
OF POLICIES TO TRY TO ACHIEVE

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.875
THAT YOU KNOW 40% REDUCTION UP

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:22.076
TO TWENTY THIRTY. BUT IF YOU'RE

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:23.344
LOOKING AT REALLY A MORE

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.879
AMBITIOUS LONG TERM GOALS IN

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:26.514
PARTICULAR. YOU MIGHT THINK

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:27.916
ABOUT KIND OF A DIFFERENT

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:28.850
STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING THOSE

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.051
LONG TERM GOALS AND NOT

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.286
NECESSARILY SORT OF THE SAME

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:33.621
SET OF ALL SEASON STRATEGIES OR

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:35.356
CAN WE DO NOT NEED. A LONG TERM

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:37.225
GOAL. I APOLOGIZE IF YOU'RE

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:42.797
HEARING SOME. NOISE OUTSIDE. MY

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.065
WINDOW. I THINK I JUST HAD A

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:45.166
LOAD TRUCK MISTER. SO I YOU

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:46.134

RIGHT ON BUT I MEAN IT YOU KNOW

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:53.308
IN THE END THEY'RE SORT OF THE

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.576
THERE'S A- A DIFFICULT

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:55.777
BALANCING ACT I KNOW THAT

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:56.978
YOU'LL YOU'LL HAVE TO KIND OF

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:57.912
WRESTLE WITH THEM TRYING TO

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:59.814
KIND OF. SORT OUT BOTH THE AND

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.382
THE AMBITION BUT ALSO SORT OF

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:02.283
THE COST OF MEETING THOSE

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.786
GOALS- ANSWER THE MIX OF

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:07.755
POLICIES THAT ARE- KIND OF-

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.524
BEST ABLE TO MEET THOSE GOALS

01:27:09.591 --> 01:27:11.092
IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY I GUESS

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.594
ONE OTHER THING. I DO WANT TO

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:13.561
MENTION AND I THINK YOU KIND

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:17.098
OF. TOUCHED ON THIS- AS WELL IS

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:17.865
I GUESS WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:19.601
MIX OF POLICIES AND KIND OF

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:21.035
WHERE THE STATE WANTS TO GO AND

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:23.471
HOW AMBITIOUS IT WANTS TO BE.

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.906
IN ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE THINKING

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.141
ABOUT WHICH POLICIES DO KIND OF

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.010
HAVE THAT THE BIGGEST IMPACTS

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.746
AND KIND OF. YOU KNOW WHAT WILL

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:33.615
BE ADOPTED OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:35.283
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT TECHNOLOGIES

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:36.784
MIGHT CALIFORNIA BE ABLE TO

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:38.119
PUSH THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:39.587
ADOPTED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:40.655
AND HAVE THAT KIND OF. A

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:42.657
BIGGER- IMPACT AND INFLUENCE

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:45.560
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA- IT COULD

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:46.995
BE SORT OF IN AND OUT POLICY

01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:49.564
DEMONSTRATION CONTACTS MAYBE

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:50.031
CALIFORNIA CAN SORT OF

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.499
DEMONSTRATE HOW TO. IMPLEMENT

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:53.601
CERTAIN POLICIES OR KIND OF YOU

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:54.736
KNOW HOW TO DESIGN CERTAIN

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.070
POLICIES IN A WAY THAT THAN

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:57.572
OTHER JURISDICTIONS CAN LEARN

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:59.440
FROM- WE THINK THOSE ARE KIND

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:00.441
OF VERY IMPORTANT

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:01.609
CONSIDERATIONS AND THINKING

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:03.478
ABOUT. HOW CAN CALIFORNIA

01:28:03.544 --> 01:28:05.613
HOUSE- HAVE THE GREATEST

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.881
IMPACTS AND KIND OF YOU KNOW

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:07.582
THAT IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:09.050
WORLD AT LEAST. THINKING ABOUT

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:09.884
KIND OF SOME OF THOSE BIGGER

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.285
PICTURE QUESTIONS AND WORKING

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:12.920
KIND OF CALIFORNIA DEMONSTRATE

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:14.222
OTHER JURISDICTIONS OR SORT OF

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:15.223
INFLUENCE WHAT OTHER

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:16.691
JURISDICTIONS ARE GOING SO.

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.826
THOSE ARE- I THINK MY SORT OF

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:19.994
INITIAL COMMENTS BUT THE OTHERS

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:26.901
ARE YOUR. COMMENTS ARE ARE. OR

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:27.502
SORT OF VERY CRITICAL KIND OF

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:28.436
THE- BIG PICTURE BY. ABOUT THE

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.505
STATE'S GOING. HAPPY TO- CAN TO

THE CONVERSATION AROUND. D. THE

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:36.010
CONCLUSION OF OUR STAFF REPORT

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:38.246
TALKS ABOUT THIS. MOMENT IN

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:39.280
TIME WE HAVE A NEW CHAIR AT

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.282

MAINLY TO SENATOR STAND I WAS

OUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT- AND AS

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:58.399
SIGNATURE NATURAL RESOURCES ON

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.902
THE DAY AFTER THE ORANGE KIND

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:04.405
OF APOCALYPTIC SKY- BLANKETED

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:07.408
MUCH OF THE BAY AREA AND HE

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:10.812
SAID. THAT SAME CONCERN ABOUT

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:14.515
AMBITION- AND BASICALLY SAID.

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:16.350
WE NEED TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:18.186
EVERY SINGLE POLICY AND

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:19.420
UNDERSTAND CAN WE ACCELERATE

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:21.889
IT- HALF HOW AN WE DO THAT AND

01:29:21.956 --> 01:29:23.725
SECONDLY WHAT AREAS ARE WE NOT

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:25.093
CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THAT WE

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:27.028
NEED TO CITING. I'M FROM THE

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:27.895
HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE

01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:30.098
ADMINISTRATION THAT THAT BOND

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.733
TO DECLINE IS SHED IN ADDITION

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:32.867
IF YOU LOOK AT THE SB ONE

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:34.736
HUNDRED GOAL. THAT THE BY THE

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:37.438
DEMONISATION PUT OUT ITS TWENTY

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:38.372
THIRTY FIVE HOUSES TWENTY FORTY

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:40.808
FIVE- WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:42.143
WHAT WE'RE DOING HOW WE'RE

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.544
DOING AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:45.847
ACHIEVE THAT- IN IN EVERY

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:49.283
SINGLE SECTOR- YOU KNOW WE

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:52.520
GOTTA HAVE PLACE I THINK WHERE.

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:54.155
WE HAD MORE THAN A HUNDRED

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.189
LAWSUITS AGAINST THE TRUMP

01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:57.024
ADMINISTRATION WE ARE MY

01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:58.626
HEADSPACE CERTAINLY HAS HAD TO

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:01.596
CHANGE IN THE LAST MONTH FROM A

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:02.230
PLACE WHERE IT'S VERY

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:05.166
DEFENSIVE. AND WE'RE REALLY-

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.568
DEALING WITH ENORMOUS HEADWINDS

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:09.470
TO WE GOT TAILWINDS NOW LIKE

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.139
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO HOW WE

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:13.007
GONNA DO IT HOW WE CAN I THINK

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.276
ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY- BECAUSE

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:17.378
THE SIZE IS ALSO AS AS DANNY

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:19.447
AND OTHERS WE'RE GONNA AND

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:22.183
LIANG CAN CAN. ATTEST THIS IS

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.051
YOUR SHOWING THE IMMEDIACY OF

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:26.087
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT RIGHT WE

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:28.356
REALLY AT. I THINK THE

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:31.058
WILDFIRES- THE FLIP SIDE THAT

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.827
SIDE OF THE WILDFIRES IS A LOT

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.662
OF IT WAS CALLED BY DROUGHT.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.231
I'M AND DEAD TREES- FROM

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:38.699
BEATLES NOW THE INFESTATIONS

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.535
THAT WERE CRIME RELATED WE YOU

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:42.770
KNOW BOTH THE WILD FIRS

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:44.505
THEMSELVES BUT WHY THAT BECAUSE

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:46.140
I'M ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:47.041
CHANGE AND WE GET INTO THE SEA

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:49.010
LEVEL RISE FLOODING ATMOSPHERIC

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:51.779
RIVERS- YEAH WAY I'M VERY

01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:53.347
WORRIED ABOUT US MOVING INTO

01:30:53.414 --> 01:30:55.283
THE DROUGHT AND DRY WEATHER

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:57.485
CONDITIONS THIS SUMMER. SO DID

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:58.920
THE ALL OF THE ABOVE POLICY

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.154
WHETHER IT'S WATER RESILIENCY

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:02.590
PORTFOLIO ALL OTHER THINGS I'M

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:04.258
I'M A 100% ON BOARD REVIEWS AND

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:06.394
THAT THE STAND WE NEED WE NEED

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:07.929
TO LOOK UNDER EVERY ROCK-

01:31:07.995 --> 01:31:09.564
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:10.798
HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE IT BECAUSE

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:12.133
FRANKLY OF CALIFORNIA'S NOT

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:19.707
DOING IT. OTHER PLACES AROUND

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:20.908
THE WORLD ALL IN STATE WE CAN

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:21.876
WAIT THIS WELLS THAT WE THAT

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:23.311
LEAD. ROLE WE NEED TO PLAY AN I

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:24.212
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:25.112
THE- AND THE ENTIRE LED. TO GET

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:31.018
THAT DONE. FIVE YES. VERY QUICK

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:33.054
RAISE AN EXAM- OF THIS APPROACH

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.589
IS IN THE- SB ONE HOW RIVER

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:37.725
THAT THE- AT PC ENERGY

01:31:37.792 --> 01:31:40.428
COMMISSION AND CARBS- WORKED ON

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:41.762
ALL LAST YEAR IT WILL BE

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:43.064
TRANSMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:46.801
SHORTLY- WHERE WE DID THE- PART

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:48.669
OF THE ANALYSIS WAS TAKING A

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:52.874
LOOK AT- IF WE WERE TO MOVE

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:55.142
BEYOND THE SPECIFIC STATUTORY

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:57.044
GOAL IN SB ONE HUNDRED AND WHAT

01:31:57.111 --> 01:32:00.615
MIGHT SOME DIFFERENT SCENARIOS-

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:03.017
FOR ELECTRICITY SALES- THAT WE

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:05.253
MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AND-

01:32:05.319 --> 01:32:09.023
AND WHAT THE VARIOUS- AND-

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:11.993
IMPACTS OF. OF MOVING BEYOND

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:14.095
JUST THE STATUTORY MANDATE

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:15.596
WOULD BE SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:17.632
WHERE WE DID TAKE THE

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:20.201
OPPORTUNITY TO- RIGHT OUT SOME

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:23.137
SCENARIOS BEYOND THE LEGAL

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:26.440
LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE. OKAY

01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:28.976
LET'S CONTINUE OUR AMBITIONS.

TO THE G. G. R. A FORMULA SO IS

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:41.555
WE KNOW 60% OF THAT FORMULA IS

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:44.258
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED 40%

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:47.662
THEN IT IS SPENT FOR OTHER

01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:49.530
INVESTMENTS RELATED TO CLIMATE-

01:32:49.597 --> 01:32:51.065
WHICH MEANS THERE ARE.

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:53.301
SIGNIFICANT OTHER NEEDS FOR

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:55.236
ADAPTED POLICY INITIATIVES. IN

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:57.004

HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION HUNDRED

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:18.693
TWELVE MILLION METRIC TONS IT'S

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:19.994
A COLLECT ABOUT TWENTY FOUR

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:22.530
MILLION CAR. IN WHAT WE ALSO

KNOW AS FIVE OF THE SIX LARGEST

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:25.933
WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY

WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY OF ALL

01:33:30.604 --> 01:33:32.773
TAKING PLACE IN THE LAST DECADE.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.909
IN THE CHALLENGE THAT WE SEE TO

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:35.876
IT ESPECIALLY WITH CONNOR FOR

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:37.545
FORESTS WHICH ARE SOME OF OUR

01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:39.647
BEST THINKS. IT WILL TAKE

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:41.515
NEARLY A CENTURY TO BE ABLE TO

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:44.352
RE GROW TO THEIR FULL MATURITY.

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:45.987
I IN THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:48.222
FACED WITH NOW WITH WHILE THEM

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:50.825
FIRE IS THAT THIS STATE PROUDLY

01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.626
IS DOING MORE TO COMBAT CLIMATE

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:54.595
CHANGE. THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:57.298
THIS UNION. BUT THESE WILDFIRES

01:33:57.365 --> 01:33:59.133

HAVEN'T EVEN GONE INTO THE

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:09.877
HEALTH IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE

01:34:09.944 --> 01:34:11.612

TIME WEEKS AT A TIME NORTHERN

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:21.122
CALIFORNIA. SO THE G. G. R. F.

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:25.659
FUNDING SOURCE- DUE TO ITS

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.550
WITH KIND OF. WHAT FUNDING KIND

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:58.285
OF CURRENTLY GOING AND I AND I

01:35:58.352 --> 01:36:00.254
THINK TO THE SENATE IS FINE AND

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:02.756
THAT THE ALLOCATION. WE'VE

01:36:02.823 --> 01:36:05.426
REALLY PRIORITIZED- A NUMBER OF

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:12.266
FACTORS. BUT BASICALLY I AM

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:13.868
LOOKING AT EQUITY ECONOMIC

01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:16.270
RECOVERY AND HEALTH AS THE

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:18.305
THREE ELEMENTS THAT THAT WE

01:36:18.372 --> 01:36:22.143
WANT TO PRIORITIZE THIS LIMITED

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:25.012
CHAD STARTED THIS HEARING-

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:26.647
CLEARLY ARTICULATING THAT THOSE

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.382
ARE ISSUES THAT YOU GET TO

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.584
PROGRAM AND MAKE THE DECISION

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:34.388
ON. WE TRIED THROUGH THE

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.590
DISCIPLINE THAT WE HAVE ALL

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.359
THIS BUDGET PROCESS TO USE THE

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:40.661
LIMITED FUNDING I'M IN A WAY

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.663
THAT MAXIMIZES ACROSS THE

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.565
ENTIRE CLIMATE PORTFOLIO WALL

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:47.401
WHAT WE CAN DO THAT WOULD OPEN

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:47.902
TO OBVIOUSLY HAVING THAT

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:49.670
DISCUSSION WITH YOU AND- LOOK

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:51.105
FORWARD TO DOING THAT MAYBE IN

01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:53.174
IN THE NEXT SESSION IT IN I'M

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.942
I'M ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH THAT

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:55.910
AND I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:59.880
THAT JUST IF YOU DON'T MIND.

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:00.514
JUST MR SECRETARY. YOUR

01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:02.149

CAN GET INTO THE FORMULA

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:11.492
INSTABILITY HERE- IN THE NEXT

01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:12.593
SECTION OF THIS HEARING BUT IF

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.228
YOU DON'T MIND. JUST TALKING TO

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:15.095
US ABOUT YOUR STRATEGY TO BE A

01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:17.064
FREE UP SOME FUNDING FOR

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:22.002
WILDFIRE MITIGATION. DOES AND I

01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:23.837
THINK THAT IT WAS PRESENTED AT

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:25.940
THIS COMMITTEE ALL. PERHAPS I'M

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.741
BETTER NOW THAT I'M DOES IT

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:29.643
BILLION DOLLAR WILDFIRE

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:32.580
PROGRAM- THAT. THAT IS IN FRONT

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:34.315
OF THE LEGISLATURE FROM. THE

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:35.683
GOVERNOR IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:37.851
NOT. VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:39.587
BUT MOST OF THAT IS ONE TIME

01:37:39.653 --> 01:37:42.022
RIGHT. SO THIS IS AN ONGOING

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:43.524
CHALLENGE THIS IS A CRISIS IT'S

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:44.658
BEEN IN THE STATE FOR TEN

01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:46.961
YEARS- IT'S GROWING WORSE. SO I

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.295
I'M VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:50.064
LAST WEEK BUT A LOT OF IT IS

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:52.132
ONE TIME FUNDING. OKAY PJ THAT

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:56.370
AB. I GUESS THE POINT IS. THE

01:37:56.437 --> 01:37:58.038
WHAT WE'VE I THINK GOT IN THE

01:37:58.105 --> 01:37:59.907
TRAP OF AND I THINK HE'LL

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:02.109
YOU'LL POINTING OUT IS IF IT'S

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:04.745
A G. JARETH LI. FUNDING PLAY I

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:07.381
MEAN THE GOVERNOR THAT. THIS IN

01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:09.116
THIS BUDGET WANTED TO CUT-

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:10.985
GENERAL FUND MONEY AND YET IT

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:13.087
IS ONE TIME MONEY BUT- THE

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.855
POINT IS. THERE ISN'T

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:17.291
SUFFICIENT MONEY IN THE IN THE

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:19.026
G. GERAK IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:20.728
REDUCTION FUND WHICH COMES FROM

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:23.764
CAP AND TRADE. REVENUES TO DO

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:25.165
NEARLY ANY OF THE THINGS THAT

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:26.900
WE NEEDED TO DO THAT IF YOU

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:29.370
LOOK AT- ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:31.138
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT I'M-

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:32.673
I THINK THE JAIL WAS TALKING

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.908
ABOUT. SOME OF THOSE FUNDS IF

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:36.610
YOU LOOK AT WILDFIRE.

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:38.979
PREVENTION THE MONEY JUST

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:41.415
SIMPLY ISN'T THAT SO PART OF

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:43.684
THE QUESTION THAT THAT- THAT I

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:45.552
THINK YOU'RE RAISING IS ABOUT

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.054
THEIR CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:49.356
MESSES THE NON CONTINUOUS. I'M

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:52.192
THERE IS ONLY A 40% THAT'S

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:54.695
AVAILABLE- IT'S A REALLY ISN'T

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:56.330
A LOT OF. A LOT OF THERE IS

01:38:56.397 --> 01:38:57.998
VERY LITTLE HEADROOM TO BE ABLE

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.433
TO MOVE THESE THINGS AROUND I

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.502
WE TRY. THE BEST THAT WE CAN

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.103
THROUGH A DISCIPLINED APPROACH

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.805
TO PRIORITIZE THAT THE G. CARE

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:07.041
ACT FUNDING. I'M WE'LL TALK

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:08.642
ABOUT HOW WE DID THAT BUT IT ON

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:09.643
TO YOUR QUESTION IS THEIR

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:11.078
ABILITY TO FREE UP MORE MONEY

01:39:11.145 --> 01:39:13.547
WITHIN THE G. CARE ACT- I THINK

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.849
THE ANSWER IS NO. IT YOU KNOW

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:16.950

LINE IS. TWENTY SECONDS

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:23.924
RESEARCHER IS THAT WE NEED TO

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.759
LOOK AT THIS FORMULA ONE TO BE

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:27.194
A TO BRING MORE STABILITY TO

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:29.063
FORMULA AN ADDITIONAL ROOM TO

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:30.597

01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:45.939
PLAN UP AVAILABLE ON OUR

TO. SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE KEY

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:56.416
POINTS FROM THAT- I KNOW

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:57.217
THERE'S KIND OF A LOT OF

01:50:57.283 --> 01:50:58.585
NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:50:58.651 --> 01:50:59.652
PACKAGING KIND OF DIFFERENT

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.321
AMOUNTS- I DO WANT TO KIND OF

01:51:01.388 --> 01:51:02.756
HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE. AGAIN

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.324
THAT THERE IS BOTH THE CURRENT

01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:06.259
YEAR COMPONENT TO THIS PACKAGE

01:51:06.326 --> 01:51:07.994
AS WELL AS A BUDGET YOU'RE A

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:10.330
COMPONENT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:10.930
TWENTY FOUR MILLION-

01:51:10.997 --> 01:51:12.232
DISCRETIONARY FUNDING IN THE

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:14.434
CURRENT YEAR AND SEVEN HUNDRED

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:15.235
FORTY FIVE. MILLION

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:16.836
DISCRETIONARY FUNDING IN THE

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:20.073
BUDGET YEAR- I THINK IT IS- AS

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.307
IT IS KIND OF BEEN HIGHLIGHTED

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:23.276
ALREADY- IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:24.577
THAT THIS THE DISCRETIONARY

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:26.279
PACKAGES QUITE A BIT LESS THAN

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:27.680
IT HAS BEEN IN PRIOR YEARS AND

01:51:27.747 --> 01:51:28.548
THAT'S FOR A COUPLE DIFFERENT

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:30.784
REASONS. ONE JUST LOWER REVENUE

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.252
LOWER EXPECTED REVENUE COMING

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:33.653
AND RELATIVE TO A COUPLE OF

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:35.255
YEARS AGO. AND THEN

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:36.456
SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:37.624
THE DISCRETIONARY PACKAGE AND I

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:39.526
THINK THIS IS WHAT- SENATOR AYE

01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:41.661
MCGUIRE WAS ALLUDING TO. THERE

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:42.829
IS A PORTION OF FUNDING WHICH

01:51:42.896 --> 01:51:44.197
IS SORT OF MOVED INTO THE

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:45.465
CONTINUOUS OF CORPORATIONS-

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:47.534
CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS NOW

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.968
SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:50.637
ANNUAL REVENUE ANOTHER SIGNAL

01:51:50.703 --> 01:51:51.604
FOR OF WHAT DRINKING WATER AS

01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:52.839
PART OF THAT SO THAT JUST KIND

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:54.741
OF FURTHER REDUCES THE- AMOUNT

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:55.975
OF MONEY AVAILABLE IN THE

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:57.777
DISCRETIONARY- PORTION OF

01:51:57.844 --> 01:52:00.313
FUNDING- AND I WON'T GO THROUGH

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.615
ALL THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT- THE

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:04.617
SANCHEZ- TOUCHED ON KIND OF A

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:05.852
LOT OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS-

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:08.054
I WON'T GO THROUGH THOSE. AGAIN

01:52:08.121 --> 01:52:09.222
JUST TO MAYBE HIGHLIGHT YOU

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:10.557
KNOW THAT THE PROPOSED FUNDING

01:52:10.623 --> 01:52:11.925
WOULD WOULD REALLY GOING TO

01:52:11.991 --> 01:52:14.127
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE IN THE PAST

01:52:14.194 --> 01:52:16.062
COMMONLY RECEIVE G. G. R. S.

01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:17.697
BUT THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:19.365
LIKE CRP WHICH WAS MENTIONED

01:52:19.432 --> 01:52:20.967
THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED AND

01:52:21.034 --> 01:52:22.735
PRIORITISED IN THIS PACKAGE. SO

01:52:22.802 --> 01:52:24.170
I THINK OUR OUR HE COMMENTS ON

01:52:24.237 --> 01:52:25.839
THE PACKAGE OVERALL AT A HIGH

01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:31.077
LEVEL ARE. ONE WE DO THINK THE

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:31.578
REVENUE ESTIMATES OF THE

01:52:31.644 --> 01:52:32.145
MINISTRY ATION IS ASSUMING.

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:34.614
REGION AND REASONABLE- FOR NOW-

01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:35.915
BUT OF COURSE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:52:35.982 --> 01:52:36.883
THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:38.051
AS YOU KNOW AROUND CAP AND

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:39.285
TRADE REVENUE IN A LOT OF.

01:52:39.352 --> 01:52:40.153
VOLATILITY IN THE REVENUE

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.554
SOURCE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP

01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:42.822
IN MIND IF YOU'RE THINKING

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:44.657
ABOUT YOUR- OVERALL PACKAGE.

01:52:44.724 --> 01:52:47.694
THE SECOND POINT IS- WITH THE

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.928
CURRENT REVENUE ESTIMATES ON

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:51.531
THE PROPOSED EXPENDITURES- THE

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:53.399
ESTIMATED FUND BALANCE AT THE

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:54.667
END OF BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR IN

01:52:54.734 --> 01:52:56.269
THE BUDGET YEAR- IN OUR VIEW

01:52:56.336 --> 01:52:57.637
IS. STILL RATHER IS RELATIVELY

01:52:57.704 --> 01:52:59.839
SMALL- ROUGHLY A HUNDRED

01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:02.709
MILLION DOLLARS AT THE END OF

01:53:02.775 --> 01:53:03.343
BUDGET YOU'RE WITH HIS PROPOSED

01:53:03.409 --> 01:53:05.078
PACKAGE. AND SO WE DO THINK

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:06.346
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND

01:53:06.412 --> 01:53:07.847
GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF THE

01:53:07.914 --> 01:53:10.650
REVENUE. SOURCE THAT IT'S A

01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:12.185
RELATIVELY SMALL FUND BALANCE

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:13.453
SO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN KIND

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.721
OF THINKING ABOUT THE OVERALL

01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:16.122
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU'RE-

01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:17.757
I'M GOING TO BE ALLOCATING. IN

01:53:17.824 --> 01:53:18.558
BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:21.227
YEAR. AND FINALLY ON THE- JUST

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:24.330
ON THE EARLY ACTION COMPONENTS-

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:25.465
WE THINK THAT CERTAIN

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:27.200
COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE ARE

01:53:27.267 --> 01:53:28.935
MORE JUSTIFIED FOR EARLY ACTION

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:31.104
THAN OTHERS- IN GENERAL THERE

01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:32.405
ARE JUST. NO TRADE OFFS WHEN

ADOPTING. SOME CURRENT YEAR

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:43.016
FUNDING BUT THAT- ALSO SORT OF

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:44.050
LIMITS TO KEEP TRADE OFF IS

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:45.118
THAT NOT NOT WHEN THAT SORT OF

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:46.553
THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO.

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:48.922
DELIBERATE OVER- THOSE PROPOSED

01:53:48.988 --> 01:53:50.523
EXPENDITURES AND SO IT- WE

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:51.724
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:53:51.791 --> 01:53:53.159
STRONG JUSTIFICATION FOR EARLY

WITH- STATUTORY. GUIDANCE IN SB

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:09.309
NINE OH ONE AND WE ALSO THINK

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:10.810
THERE'S- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:12.145
MADE A CASE THAT'S- AND BY

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:13.813
PROVIDING OUTSTANDING EARLY-

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.648
SOME OF THOSE FIRE REDUCTION-

01:54:15.715 --> 01:54:17.650
PROJECTS- OR FOREST HEALTH

01:54:17.717 --> 01:54:18.985
PROJECTS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED.

01:54:19.052 --> 01:54:21.421
ARE PRIOR TO THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:54:21.487 --> 01:54:23.156
TWO A FIRE SEASON SO THERE'S-

01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:24.591
IF. THERE'S ANY OF THOSE THAT

01:54:24.657 --> 01:54:32.565
ARE A REASON TO. ACTUALLY.

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:33.166
INCLUDE THAT AS EARLY ACTION.

FIRST- I CONSIDERED. THE EARLY

OUT PACKED TO AND LESS THAN

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:38.705
DIMINISH. IS AND- THAT WOULD

01:54:38.771 --> 01:54:39.772
YOU KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:54:39.839 --> 01:54:41.274
COULD CONSIDER YOU KNOW INSTEAD

01:54:41.341 --> 01:54:42.375

ALTERNATE WOULD REALLY JUST BE

01:54:51.784 --> 01:54:53.920
TO FOCUS ON THE WILDFIRE PIECE

01:54:53.987 --> 01:54:55.154
OF THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE AND

01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:56.623

ARE FOR OVER THE NEXT FEW

01:57:55.835 --> 01:57:56.969
MONTHS THERE ARE STILL SOME

THAT PROVIDES MORE REBATES- BUT

01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:03.743
I THINK THINKING ABOUT-

01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:05.077
CERTAINLY KIND OF WHAT THE

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:07.480

THAT AND- HISTORICALLY BEEN

01:58:10.583 --> 01:58:11.851
OVERSUBSCRIBED THINKING ABOUT

01:58:11.918 --> 01:58:13.186

CUT TOUCH ON. THE ISSUE. THE

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:29.402
REASON AND IS RETURNING FOR.

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:32.238
IT'S JUST A GENERAL MATTER. WE

01:58:32.305 --> 01:58:33.606
DO THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT

01:58:33.673 --> 01:58:34.340
TO THE LEGISLATURE TO BE

01:58:34.407 --> 01:58:35.441
THINKING ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:38.077
PIECES TOGETHER- ANSWER GOING

01:58:38.144 --> 01:58:40.279
TO CONTINUALLY ASSESS YOU KNOW

01:58:40.346 --> 01:58:41.681

LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES AND SO-

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:50.857
YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT THOSE

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:51.958
TWO PIECES TOGETHER I KNOW WE

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:52.925
OFTEN FOCUS ON THE

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:54.327
DISCRETIONARY HE'S THINKING

01:58:54.393 --> 01:58:55.628
ABOUT- BOTH DISCRETIONARY

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:56.996
CONTINUOUS WE THINK THIS WOULD

01:58:57.063 --> 01:58:58.130
WORK TO ENSURE THE MONEY IS

01:58:58.197 --> 01:58:59.932
GOING TO HIS LEGISLATIVE

01:58:59.999 --> 01:59:02.835

HAPPY TO ANSWER. I'M GOING TO

01:59:07.106 --> 01:59:09.208
KEEP A LITTLE BIT LONGER

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:11.177
UNIQUE SITUATION WE HAVE ONE

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:12.945
TIME MONEY YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T

01:59:13.012 --> 01:59:14.647

ABOUT WE'VE GOT EXCESS MONEY IN

01:59:16.749 --> 01:59:17.817
THE BUDGET MAYBE MORE EXCESS

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:19.952
MONEY AND IT'S NOT LOST ON

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:21.654
ANYBODY ON THIS PANEL THAT

01:59:21.721 --> 01:59:23.956
RESOURCES IS ALWAYS GET LEFT

01:59:24.023 --> 01:59:25.892

YOU THINK THAT THOSE ARE COULD

01:59:46.379 --> 01:59:48.414
BE GIVEN THE IMPACT THAT THEY

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:50.383
WOULD HAVE. REASONABLE

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:52.451
EXPENDITURES FOR GENERAL FUND

01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:54.687

NUGENT FUND FOR A- THAT'S A

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:38.664
IT'S A REASONABLE THING TO LOOK

ONE TIME FUNDS THAT'S THAT'S

02:01:00.453 --> 02:01:00.886
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THE

02:01:00.953 --> 02:01:02.888

THE- SENATE IN GENERAL ABOUT.

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:29.649
TARGETING SOME MARKET FAILURES

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:31.217
IN THE IN THE CAP AND TRADE

02:01:31.283 --> 02:01:32.885

02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:35.788
PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN PUT IN

02:01:35.855 --> 02:01:37.990
THAT SCIENCE ESEARCH THAT WERE

02:01:38.057 --> 02:01:39.325
THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS NOT

02:01:39.392 --> 02:01:40.960
GOING. TO TAKE CARE OF THEY'RE

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:42.561
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO. THE

02:01:42.628 --> 02:01:44.363
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:47.867
PROPOSAL HAS NONE OF THAT YET-

02:01:47.933 --> 02:01:48.668
HOW CAN YOU GIVE US SOME

02:01:48.734 --> 02:01:50.569
CONTEXT OF WHAT WHAT THE

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:51.904
IMPORTANCE IS TO MAKING THESE

02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:53.005
INVESTMENTS IN THESE PILOT

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:55.608
PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE THAT NEXT

02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:57.043
GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGIES DONE

02:01:57.109 --> 02:02:02.381
THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS NOT.

02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:03.049
COULD HAVE ALWAYS INVESTED THEM.

02:02:03.115 --> 02:02:04.517
YES I THINK OUR COMMENTS AND

02:02:04.583 --> 02:02:05.851
RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THIS

02:02:05.918 --> 02:02:07.086
ITEM AS YOU MENTIONED ARE KIND

02:02:07.153 --> 02:02:08.988

KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE- THE MOST

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:13.392
APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:14.760
GOVERNMENTS AND KIND OF SOME OF

02:02:14.827 --> 02:02:16.295
THESE CHANGES AND AN EMISSION

02:02:16.362 --> 02:02:18.531
REDUCTION ACTIVITIES SENDS. WE

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:19.799
TALKED A LOT ABOUT CAP AND

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:21.667
TRADE IN CARBON PRICING TO SORT

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:23.002
OF TRY TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW SOME

02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:24.103
OF THAT THE EXTERNALITIES

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.705
ESSENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH-

02:02:25.771 --> 02:02:27.740
WITH CARBON EMISSIONS BUT- THAT

02:02:27.807 --> 02:02:28.808
DOESN'T. NECESSARILY GET YOU

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:30.509
ALL THE WAY THERE AND THERE ARE

02:02:30.576 --> 02:02:32.344
I THINK SORT OF STRONG.

02:02:32.411 --> 02:02:33.779
RATIONALES FOR SOME GOVERNMENT

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:36.315
SUPPORT FOR- RESEARCH AND

02:02:36.382 --> 02:02:38.384
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES- PILOTS

02:02:38.451 --> 02:02:40.886
AND DEMONSTRATIONS FOR. EARLY

02:02:40.953 --> 02:02:43.756
STAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO. THE YOU

02:02:43.823 --> 02:02:44.990
KNOW PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION

02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:46.092
ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE

02:02:46.158 --> 02:02:48.327
TECHNOLOGIES WORK AND KIND OF

02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:49.695
HELP THAT. THE MARKET FOR THOSE

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:51.731
TYPES OF. ACTIVITIES AND SO WE

02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:52.932
DO THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:54.867
PLACE TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU

02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:56.702
CAN'T HAVE LIMITED FUNDS. HOW

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:58.504
TO SORT OF FILL GAPS OR KIND OF

02:02:58.571 --> 02:03:00.039
YOU KNOW HOW TO- FUND

02:03:00.106 --> 02:03:01.140
ACTIVITIES WHERE THERE'S A

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:02.541
STRONG SORT OF RATIONALE FOR

02:03:02.608 --> 02:03:04.310
SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT. OUR

02:03:04.376 --> 02:03:06.145
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR THOSE

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:08.647
FOR THOSE PROGRAMS- IT IT IT I

02:03:08.714 --> 02:03:10.216
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE

02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:12.151
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE FUNDING

02:03:12.218 --> 02:03:14.587
COULD GO TO. SOME PILOT AND

02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:16.288
DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITIES BUT

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:18.257
YOU'RE RIGHT FOR THEM- AND

02:03:18.324 --> 02:03:19.992
THERE MIGHT BE I THINK- EVEN IN

02:03:20.059 --> 02:03:21.327
THE AGRICULTURAL AREA OTHERS I

02:03:21.393 --> 02:03:23.496
THINK. POTENTIAL FOR SOME-

02:03:23.562 --> 02:03:25.731
PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS BUT-

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:26.699
OVERALL A LOT OF THE MONEY I

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:28.067
THINK IT'S GOING TO KIND OF.

02:03:28.134 --> 02:03:30.069
MORE DEPLOYMENT- INCENTIVES ON

02:03:30.136 --> 02:03:31.170
A LOT OF CASES AND SO THAT'S

02:03:31.237 --> 02:03:32.471
JUST THAT'S ONE KIND OF

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:33.205
IMPORTANT THING THE LEGISLATURE

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:35.641
THINK LAUGHTER. AFTER WAY AND A

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:37.143
PARTLY GETS BACK AT SORT OF THE

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:38.377
SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WE HAD

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:39.145
AROUND SORT OF NEAR TERM

02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:41.413
VERSUS. LONG TERM GOALS THOSE

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.048
THOSE PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS

02:03:43.115 --> 02:03:45.251
AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE- KIND OF

02:03:45.317 --> 02:03:46.886
EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGIES AND

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:49.054
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS-

02:03:49.121 --> 02:03:50.456
HAVE MORE OF A KIND OF LONG

02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:52.224
TERM FOCUS WEARING IT I THINK

02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:53.793
THE HOPE IS THAT OVER TIME SOME

02:03:53.859 --> 02:03:55.494
OF THOSE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE-

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:56.962
THE COSTS WILL COME DOWN IN

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:58.397
THAT THEY- THEY WILL BE

02:03:58.464 --> 02:04:04.036
pTHE OF THE LONGER TERM GOALS.

02:04:04.103 --> 02:04:04.670
BUT THAT'S SORT OF THAT I THINK

02:04:04.737 --> 02:04:05.271
THE TENSION THAT YOU YOUR FACE

02:04:05.337 --> 02:04:05.938
AND OF HOW TO. AND TRYING TO OF

02:04:06.005 --> 02:04:06.505
FIGURE OUT HOW TO. ALLOCATE

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:07.439
YOUR FUNDS ACROSS DIFFERENT

02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:09.475
PROGRAMS IS PARTLY THAT THAT

02:04:09.542 --> 02:04:10.109
SORT OF SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG

02:04:10.176 --> 02:04:12.311
TERM FOCUS. AND THERE'S WHERE

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:14.613
THE FUN BEGINS- ALL RIGHT.

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:16.649

WANT TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF

02:08:08.213 --> 02:08:09.648
POINTS AROUND THE HEALTHY SOILS

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:11.917
PROGRAM- WE ARE CURRENTLY OVER

02:08:11.984 --> 02:08:14.386
SUBSCRIBED BY 2100% WHICH IS A

02:08:14.453 --> 02:08:16.355
GOOD THING. I THINK THAT'S

02:08:16.422 --> 02:08:18.757
BECAUSE OF THE FORMULA THAT WE

02:08:18.824 --> 02:08:20.159
USE TO FUND TECHNICAL

02:08:20.225 --> 02:08:21.693
ASSISTANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:22.828
THE SMALLEST FARMERS ARE

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:24.930
SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS.

02:08:24.997 --> 02:08:25.898
AND FARMERS AND DISADVANTAGED

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:27.599
COMMUNITIES KNOW ABOUT OUR

02:08:27.666 --> 02:08:28.567
PROGRAMS AND HAVE THAT

02:08:28.634 --> 02:08:30.269
TECHNICAL SUPPORT FROM FIVE

02:08:30.335 --> 02:08:32.538
FOUR PROGRAMS. IT'S ALSO BEEN

02:08:32.604 --> 02:08:34.473
PROVIDED THE INCENTIVE GRANTS.

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:35.607
AS WELL AS FOR THE

02:08:35.674 --> 02:08:37.676
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. WE NEED

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:39.178
TO SCALE UP ALL OF THESE

02:08:39.244 --> 02:08:41.313
HEALTHY CELLS PRACTICES. IN THE

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.815
STATE IS LARGEST CALIFORNIA

02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:43.816
WITH THE DIVERSITY OF

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:45.417
AGRICULTURE THAT WE HAVE. BUT

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:47.719
THERE IS THE CROP PATTERNS. OR

02:08:47.786 --> 02:08:49.388
THE MICRO CLIMATES IN WHICH

02:08:49.455 --> 02:08:50.989
PEOPLE ARE FARMING OR THE SIZE

02:08:51.056 --> 02:08:51.857
OF THEIR FARMS THESE

02:08:51.924 --> 02:08:53.292
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS I THINK

02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:55.127
HAVE REALLY HELPED US. CREATE A

02:08:55.194 --> 02:08:57.162
PLATFORM FOR MORE FARMERS TO

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:59.131
SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND TO

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:00.265
ADOPT THOSE PRACTICES

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:01.834
THEMSELVES. A NUMBER OF THOSE

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.135
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS HAVE

02:09:03.202 --> 02:09:05.104
ALSO COLLECTED DATA SO THAT WE

02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:06.772
CAN PROVIDE REAL TIME

02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:07.973
INFORMATION TO FARMERS ABOUT

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.308
WITH THE ECONOMICS ARE WHAT THE

02:09:09.374 --> 02:09:11.043
TRADE OFFS ARE WITH THE

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:12.444
DECISION MAKING PROCESS YEAH.

02:09:12.511 --> 02:09:15.280
I'M TO DATE. WE HAVE FUNDED

02:09:15.347 --> 02:09:16.448
APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO MILLION

02:09:16.515 --> 02:09:19.785
DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO A TOTAL OF

02:09:19.852 --> 02:09:20.719
SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX

02:09:20.786 --> 02:09:22.121
PROJECTS THAT'S A COMBINATION

02:09:22.187 --> 02:09:23.455
OF FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

02:09:23.522 --> 02:09:24.990
INDIVIDUAL FARMER INCENTIVE

02:09:25.057 --> 02:09:27.092
GRANTS. AS WELL AS SIXTY SIX

02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:28.794
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. THAT

02:09:28.861 --> 02:09:31.563
COVER OVER FIFTY SIX THOUSAND

02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:33.866
ACRES. S. A. KUESTER CO TWO

02:09:33.932 --> 02:09:35.868
EQUIVALENT OF A HUNDRED AND TEN

02:09:35.934 --> 02:09:38.637
THOUSAND METRIC TONS- AS WE

02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:40.172
HAVE EVOLVED THIS PROGRAM IN A

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:41.874
FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WE

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.075
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALIGNED

02:09:43.142 --> 02:09:44.743
WITH THE USDA NATURAL RESOURCES

02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:46.745
CONSERVATION. SERVICE THE

02:09:46.812 --> 02:09:48.847
STANDARD PRACTICES. SO IT'S

02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:50.682
SOMETHING THAT'S FAMILIAR. AND

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:52.818
AS EVIDENCE BASED SCIENCE BASED

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:55.254
PRACTICES. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:57.456
TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PRACTICES

02:09:57.523 --> 02:09:59.458
AS TO GET THE DATA TO DO SO.

02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:01.059
THE MOST RECENT ONE HAS BEEN

02:10:01.126 --> 02:10:07.065
THIS PAST YEAR THE INCLUSION.

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:08.066
OF WHOLE ORCHARD RECYCLING. FOR

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:10.135
THOSE FOR- NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT.

02:10:10.202 --> 02:10:11.036
AUTOMATICALLY IF A WAY OF COME

02:10:11.103 --> 02:10:12.304
IN AND PULLING OUT THE WHOLE

02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:13.939
TREE MULCHING AT AND THEN

02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:15.474
IMMEDIATELY INCORPORATING THAT

02:10:15.541 --> 02:10:17.176
INTO THE SOIL TO SEQUESTER

02:10:17.242 --> 02:10:19.745
CARBON. HUGE POTENTIAL TO GROW

02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:21.847
THAT PROGRAM ESPECIALLY AS WE

02:10:21.914 --> 02:10:23.916
DEAL WITH POTENTIAL PHASE OUT

02:10:23.982 --> 02:10:25.384
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:27.219
AFTERBURNING. THE OTHER ONE I

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:28.387
WANTED TO TOUCH ON AMONGST THE

02:10:28.453 --> 02:10:29.955
MANY HEALTH BENEFITS WE GET

02:10:30.022 --> 02:10:32.157
FROM HEALTHY SOILS. IS A

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:34.159
POLLINATOR HABITAT WE HAVE

02:10:34.226 --> 02:10:35.460
SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR

02:10:35.527 --> 02:10:37.396
HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM GIVEN

02:10:37.462 --> 02:10:39.097
EXTRA POINTS TO THOSE PROJECTS

02:10:39.164 --> 02:10:40.933
FOR HEDGE ROWS IN COVER CROPS.

02:10:40.999 --> 02:10:43.202
THAT ARE VERY FRIENDLY FOR BEES

02:10:43.268 --> 02:10:44.903
MONARCH BUTTERFLIES AND OTHER

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:46.939
POLLINATORS. OF AND WITH THAT

02:10:47.005 --> 02:10:48.106
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

INCLUDED IN EARLY ACTION ALLOWS

02:10:55.147 --> 02:10:56.515
US TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM THAT WE

02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:58.550
HAVE GOING. AND REALLY HELPS

02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:00.118
OUR FARMERS IN PLANNING THE

02:11:00.185 --> 02:11:01.386
SOONER THEY KNOW THAT DOLLARS

02:11:01.453 --> 02:11:03.188
MAY BE AVAILABLE IT WILL HELP

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:04.623
THEM IN SOME OF THEIR PLAN TO

02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:06.558
DECISIONS GOING FORWARD. YEAH

VERSUS THE DIMERIC OR CULTURAL.

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:14.499
CLIMATE PROGRAMS WE HAVE

02:11:14.566 --> 02:11:16.435
HISTORICALLY WE'VE GIVEN MONEY

02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:17.803
FOR METHANE REDUCTION

02:11:17.869 --> 02:11:19.404
HISTORICALLY YOU FOR PUT THE

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:21.740
ENERGY DEPARTMENT ON INCENTIVES

02:11:21.807 --> 02:11:23.775
FOR FOOD PROCESSORS AND YOU'VE

02:11:23.842 --> 02:11:24.543
ALSO WORKED WITH THE ENERGY

02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:26.478
DEPARTMENT. FOR AGRICULTURE

02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:28.647
RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT DAY YEAH

02:11:28.714 --> 02:11:30.716
THE MICROGRID TO NAY THAT THE

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:33.151
ACT E. D. HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE

02:11:33.218 --> 02:11:34.753
ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU GOT

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.288
THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT BUDGET

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:39.524
UNDER- FOR. SMART ACADEMICS

02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:43.295
CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE CAN

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:45.230
YOU HELP US OUT. SURE I'M- A

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:46.965
MUCH OF THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS NOW

02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:50.569
BEEN PROVEN AND SO IT IS LISTED

02:11:50.636 --> 02:11:52.704
AS WHAT WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THE

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:55.507
CLIMATE. CATALYST FUND FOR

02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:56.942
CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE THE

02:11:57.009 --> 02:11:58.310
BUDGET PROPOSES FIFTY MILLION

02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:00.579
DOLLARS TO FIND EXACTLY THOSE

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:02.614
KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES. IS THE

02:12:02.681 --> 02:12:04.683
DIFFERENCE OF PROVING THAT CAN

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:06.952
WORK AND PRACTICAL EVERYDAY

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:09.388
SITUATIONS AND THEN HOW DO YOU

02:12:09.454 --> 02:12:11.623
SCALE THAT UP AND GO THROUGH

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:13.425
THE COMMERCIALIZATION TO

02:12:13.492 --> 02:12:15.427
BROADEN MAP ANDSO- LOW

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:16.695
INTEREST LOANS AND LOAN

02:12:16.762 --> 02:12:19.298
GUARANTEES CAN BE VERY HELPFUL.

02:12:19.364 --> 02:12:22.367
AND CONTINUING TO SCALE UP ITS

02:12:22.434 --> 02:12:26.672
TECHNOLOGIES. FOR THOSE THREE

02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:28.407
PROGRAMS HAD LIKE A HUNDRED AND

02:12:28.473 --> 02:12:30.442
SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TWO YEARS

02:12:30.509 --> 02:12:32.611
AGO RIGHT SO ALL THAT'S GOING

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:35.647
TO COMPETE WITH ALL THE OTHER-

02:12:35.714 --> 02:12:39.251
A PROGRAMS OKAY. HI IT JUST

02:12:39.318 --> 02:12:41.219
SEEMS LIKE NO ONE I TALK ABOUT

02:12:41.286 --> 02:12:43.288
DECARBONIZATION ONCE AGAIN IT

02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:45.090
ALL I'M NOT I'M NOT LEAVING THE

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:46.491
BAND HERE WHAT THE DIFFERENT

02:12:46.558 --> 02:12:49.428
TACK GESTURES BUT THE MONEY

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:51.129
THAT GOES IN THERE AND THE

02:12:51.196 --> 02:12:53.165
METHANE REDUCTION AND THE DEEP

02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:55.000
CARBONIZATION THAT IS. THAT IS

02:12:55.067 --> 02:12:56.435
TRANSFERABLE I MEAN IF THE

02:12:56.501 --> 02:12:58.937
TECHNOLOGY IS AS YOU SAY READY

02:12:59.004 --> 02:13:00.772
TO GO. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:01.873
LIKE TO EXPORT TO THE

02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:03.875
ARGENTINES AND THE OTHER CATTLE

02:13:03.942 --> 02:13:05.110
PRODUCING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE

02:13:05.177 --> 02:13:07.546
WORLD THE SAKE HERE'S RENT SOME

02:13:07.612 --> 02:13:10.382
ENERGY OFF IT IS RUN SOME FUEL

02:13:10.449 --> 02:13:11.717
OFFER THIS IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S

02:13:11.783 --> 02:13:14.453
A- KEY ROLE FOR CALIFORNIA WITH

02:13:14.519 --> 02:13:16.488
THE- AMOUNT OF. THE IMPORTANCE

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:19.424
OF AGRICULTURE FOR WE THAT'S TO

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:20.292
BE A LEADER IN THESE. AREAS

02:13:20.359 --> 02:13:23.762
ACKERMAN. IF IT'S READY TO GO

02:13:23.829 --> 02:13:25.464
IT'S READY TO GO IT JUST SEEMS

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:27.966
LIKE ZERO MIGHT BE. IT MIGHT BE

02:13:28.033 --> 02:13:30.135
PREMATURE BUT WILL I'M SURE MY

02:13:30.202 --> 02:13:31.436
OTHER COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE A

FOR US TO LEVERAGE THE DOLLARS

DILIGENTLY ON SB NINE A ONE AND

02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:02.988
WHO'S ALSO BEEN I WAS A MEMBER

02:16:03.054 --> 02:16:05.524
THIS YOU'RE NOT A CONSERVANCY-

02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:07.025
FOR SEVEN YEARS BEFORE I CAME

02:16:07.092 --> 02:16:08.293
TO THE LEGISLATURE WE WORKED

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:12.130

COST PER ACRE WAS REALLY HIGH

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:37.355
AND SO ONE OF THE TOOLS I THINK

02:16:37.422 --> 02:16:38.823
THAT WE'VE I THINK MISSED OUT

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.458

02:16:58.977 --> 02:17:00.879
SCALE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE. A

IN CALIFORNIA TO GET THESE

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:06.551
MOVIES- TREATED- I THINK THAT

02:17:06.618 --> 02:17:07.652
EVEN THOUGH WE PUT OF THE

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:09.788
RESOURCES IN THERE- THERE'S

02:17:09.854 --> 02:17:10.755
JUST NOT ENOUGH CONTRACTORS OUT

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:12.891

THOUGHTS WERE ON THAT IS HOW WE

02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:18.163
COULD MOVE- THE RESOURCES AND

02:17:18.229 --> 02:17:20.432
GET MORE WORK DONE ON THE

02:17:20.498 --> 02:17:22.300

WEEKWHAT- WHAT I WOULD SAY TO

02:17:36.781 --> 02:17:40.352

SPECIFIC FUNDING THAT ARE ARE

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:12.050
LOOKING AT INCREASING THE- THE-

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:16.254
TRAINING FOR SUCH WORKERS. BUT

02:18:16.321 --> 02:18:18.456
THE QUESTION OF GETTING MORE

02:18:18.523 --> 02:18:21.126
MONEY TO FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND

02:18:21.192 --> 02:18:23.061

FUNDS THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY

02:18:38.743 --> 02:18:40.178
BUT A LOT OF THOSE FUNDS ARE

02:18:40.245 --> 02:18:43.048
GOING TO A NONPROFIT AS AS WELL

02:18:43.114 --> 02:18:46.818
AS- THOSE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS.

02:18:46.885 --> 02:18:49.587
AND OTHERS AND I DO KNOW THAT

02:18:49.654 --> 02:18:51.256
LIKE ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS WE

02:18:51.322 --> 02:18:54.426
ARE OVER- SUBSCRIBED WE HAVE

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.695
MORE APPLICANTS THAN WE CAN

02:18:56.761 --> 02:19:00.298
FUND ARE CURRENTLY AND WE LOOK

02:19:00.365 --> 02:19:03.001
FORWARD TO OF WITH THESE

02:19:03.068 --> 02:19:05.070
ADDITIONAL FUNDS STARTING TO

02:19:05.136 --> 02:19:06.671
GETTING GET MORE OF THOSE FUNDS

02:19:06.738 --> 02:19:08.473
DOWN TO THOSE TYPES OF A

02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:09.908
PROJECT AREAS BOTH OF THE

02:19:09.974 --> 02:19:12.510
FOREST HEALTH AREA. BUT ALSO IN

02:19:12.577 --> 02:19:13.578
THE FIRE PREVENTION WHICH IS

02:19:13.645 --> 02:19:15.914
THAT- NEXT YEAR IN AND AROUND

02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:18.083
CLOSER TO COMMUNITIES BUT STILL

02:19:18.149 --> 02:19:23.955
HAS A VERY POSITIVE GREENHOUSE.

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:24.723
GAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST. SO I

02:19:24.789 --> 02:19:25.290
HAVE A ONE MORE ON KNOW WHO

02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:30.061
THIS WOULD ANSWER THIS- WHAT

02:19:30.128 --> 02:19:30.695
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES I

02:19:30.762 --> 02:19:32.163
BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE IN.

02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:33.998
CALIFORNIA IS THAT. YOU KNOW

02:19:34.065 --> 02:19:35.467
ALMOST 60% OF OUR LAND IS

02:19:35.533 --> 02:19:36.501
CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL

02:19:36.568 --> 02:19:39.137
GOVERNMENT AND- I BROUGHT THIS

02:19:39.204 --> 02:19:40.505
UP IN OUR LAST HEARING ABOUT

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:43.041

AGREE HE HE WHEN HE SAID

02:19:51.616 --> 02:19:52.951
CALIFORNIA'S FOREST FIRES ARE

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:55.253
CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEMS NO. THERE

02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:55.787
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

02:19:55.854 --> 02:19:57.422
PROBLEM BECAUSE 60% OF THAT

02:19:57.489 --> 02:19:58.757
LAND THEY MANAGE OR DON'T

02:19:58.823 --> 02:20:00.558
MANAGE IN MOST CASES IN AT

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:02.527
LEAST IN MY OPINION. WHAT IS A

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:05.163
NEXUS BETWEEN. THE CALIFORNIA

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:06.631
DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND THE

02:20:06.698 --> 02:20:07.398
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S FOR

02:20:09.567 --> 02:20:13.071
HOLISTICALLY TREAT. THE MOUNT

02:20:13.138 --> 02:20:14.539
OF WATERSHEDS THAT ARE IMPAIRED

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:16.708
IN CALIFORNIA AND I SAY THAT AS

02:20:16.775 --> 02:20:18.276
SOMEBODY WHO WORKED. WITH

02:20:18.343 --> 02:20:19.244
SOMETHING WE CALL THE QUINCY

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:20.779
LIBRARY GROUP WHICH WAS TWENTY

02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:22.013
FIVE YEARS AGO WHERE WE WENT

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:23.014
THROUGH AND WE SAID WE HAD A

02:20:23.081 --> 02:20:25.884
FEDERAL BILL TO DO LANDSCAPE

02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:28.987
TYPE. FUEL BREAKS SO WAS MUST

02:20:29.053 --> 02:20:34.325
MOSAIC FUEL BREAKS IN LASSEN-

02:20:34.392 --> 02:20:36.661
PLUMAS AND SIERRA. FOR THE PART

02:20:36.728 --> 02:20:38.429
OF THE TITLE FORCED TO TRY TO

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:39.564
PUT IN THESE FUEL BREAKS WE

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:41.266
WOULD HAVE A FIRE LARGER THAN

02:20:41.332 --> 02:20:41.866
EIGHT THOUSAND ACRES WE WOULD

02:20:41.933 --> 02:20:43.501
HAVE FUEL RACING OR SO. THAT'S

02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:44.469
WHAT NEED TO REALLY HAPPEN WE

02:20:44.536 --> 02:20:46.070
NEED TO GO THROUGH AND PUT FUEL

02:20:46.137 --> 02:20:47.105
BREAKS IN OUR FOR SO THAT WE

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:49.207
DON'T HAVE THESE. HUGE FOREST

02:20:49.274 --> 02:20:50.375
FIRES THAT WE CAN CONTAIN OF

02:20:50.441 --> 02:20:52.577
DUMB BACK AND TREAT. IN BETWEEN

02:20:52.644 --> 02:20:54.679
THOSE FIREBRICK SO WHO WHO IS

GOVERNMENT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO

02:20:56.347 --> 02:20:58.383
FIGURE I THINK WE REALLY MISSED

02:20:58.449 --> 02:21:01.753
THE BOAT IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:02.287
WE DON'T WE HAVE A PARTNER

02:21:02.353 --> 02:21:03.888
WHO'S NOT AT THE TABLE. SO I'M

SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST

SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE BEEN

03:08:56.925 --> 03:08:58.527

COBIT PANDEMIC- THIS PILOT

03:09:00.662 --> 03:09:03.231
PROJECTS. AND EXPANSION WILL

03:09:03.298 --> 03:09:05.634
GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:09:05.701 --> 03:09:07.703
ASSIST THOSE JURISDICTIONS IN

03:09:07.769 --> 03:09:10.105
UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE

03:09:10.172 --> 03:09:10.672
TO PROVIDE REDEMPTION

03:09:10.739 --> 03:09:12.507
OPPORTUNITIES I HAD TO

03:09:12.574 --> 03:09:17.212
CONSUMERS- AND RURAL SUBURBAN

03:09:17.279 --> 03:09:17.713
AND URBAN AREAS THAT ARE

03:09:17.779 --> 03:09:20.215
CURRENTLY UNDERSERVED.

03:09:20.282 --> 03:09:22.984
EXCELLENT I WILL NOTE ON PAGE

03:09:23.051 --> 03:09:24.086
THIRTY FOUR OF THE STAFF REPORT

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:27.389
WE HAVE A LITTLE CHART OF THE

03:09:27.456 --> 03:09:29.257
300-300-0900 AND SIXTY SEVEN.

03:09:29.324 --> 03:09:30.759
CONVENIENCE SOUNDS WE'RE

03:09:30.826 --> 03:09:32.461
MISSING ANOTHER BULLET THAT

03:09:32.527 --> 03:09:33.762
WOULD BE THE EXAM CONVENIENCE

03:09:33.829 --> 03:09:35.697
SUNSET THE THOUSAND AND ONE AND

03:09:35.764 --> 03:09:37.265
THEN THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ADD UP

03:09:37.332 --> 03:09:39.034
THAT WOULD GET A 100% WE'VE

03:09:39.101 --> 03:09:40.602
MISSED A LITTLE NUMBER THERE SO

03:09:40.669 --> 03:09:43.305
THAT'LL BE GOOD- LET'S SEE

03:09:43.371 --> 03:09:47.175
ALEJO. MISTER BROWN YOU'RE BACK

03:09:47.242 --> 03:09:52.547
GOOD MORNING AGAIN- SO- JUST TO

03:09:52.614 --> 03:09:54.116
KIND OF LEVEL SAID A LITTLE BIT

03:09:54.182 --> 03:09:55.250
JUST TO MAKE SURE THE

03:09:55.317 --> 03:09:56.251
COMMITTEES CLEAR SO THAT

03:09:56.318 --> 03:09:58.286
PROPOSAL IS FOR FIVE MILLION

03:09:58.353 --> 03:09:59.855
DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS

03:09:59.921 --> 03:10:01.089
WELL AS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

03:10:01.156 --> 03:10:02.791
THE BUDGET YEAR WHICH WOULD BE

03:10:02.858 --> 03:10:04.359
AVAILABLE TO EXPAND THE PILOTS

03:10:04.426 --> 03:10:06.561
CURRENTLY THERE ARE- THE

03:10:06.628 --> 03:10:08.597
LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY PROVIDED

03:10:08.663 --> 03:10:09.498
FIVE MILLION IN THE PREVIOUS

03:10:09.564 --> 03:10:12.134
YEAR TO. IMPLEMENT UP TO FIVE I

03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:13.869
WOULD SWITCH THE DEPARTMENT IS

03:10:13.935 --> 03:10:16.772
DOING NOW- AND SO THIS WOULD

03:10:16.838 --> 03:10:19.775
ADD ANOTHER. TEN MILLION AND

03:10:19.841 --> 03:10:20.709
WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO

03:10:20.776 --> 03:10:22.978
EXPAND FROM FIVE PILOTS TO SEND

03:10:23.044 --> 03:10:25.480
PILOTS OUT OF TIME- SO WE THINK

03:10:25.547 --> 03:10:27.849
THE PROPOSED EXPANSION FROM

03:10:27.916 --> 03:10:29.785
FIVE PILOTS TO UP TO TEN PILOTS

03:10:29.851 --> 03:10:31.586
HAS A LOT OF MERIT AND IS IT IS

03:10:31.653 --> 03:10:34.489
KIND OF A REASONABLE EXPANSION

03:10:34.556 --> 03:10:35.090
AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO

03:10:35.157 --> 03:10:37.526
EXPLORE. ADDITIONAL

03:10:37.592 --> 03:10:39.928
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIFFERENT

03:10:39.995 --> 03:10:40.762
RETENTION MODELS IN DIFFERENT

03:10:40.829 --> 03:10:43.064
JURISDICTIONS SO WE DON'T HAVE

03:10:43.131 --> 03:10:44.466
ANY ISSUES OR CONCERNS WITH

03:10:44.533 --> 03:10:45.500
THAT I THINK OUR MAIN CONCERN

03:10:45.567 --> 03:10:46.935
IS WAS JUST THE SCALE OF THE

03:10:47.002 --> 03:10:48.370
FUNDING REQUEST ASSOCIATED WITH

03:10:48.436 --> 03:10:51.239
THAT EXPANSION- AGAIN THERE'S A

03:10:51.306 --> 03:10:52.174
CURRENTLY THERE OF THE

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:53.942
LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY PROVIDED

03:10:54.009 --> 03:10:54.776
FIVE MILLION FOR FIVE PILOTS

03:10:54.843 --> 03:10:57.546
THIS WOULD BE. A TEN MILLION

03:10:57.612 --> 03:10:58.613
FOR FIVE MORE PILOTS SO IT'S

03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:00.448
KIND OF DOUBLE THE FUNDING FOR

03:11:00.515 --> 03:11:02.584
PILOTS- AND SO WE DON'T THINK

03:11:02.651 --> 03:11:03.518
THAT THAT'S REALLY JUST

03:11:03.585 --> 03:11:04.986
PROPORTIONAL WITH KIND OF THE

03:11:05.053 --> 03:11:06.655
EXPANSION IS BEING REQUESTED NO

03:11:06.721 --> 03:11:07.889
THE MINISTRATIONS INDICATED%

03:11:07.956 --> 03:11:09.057
THAT PERHAPS SOME OF THE MONEY

03:11:09.124 --> 03:11:10.458
WOULD BE USED TO EXTEND SOME

03:11:10.525 --> 03:11:12.194
PILOTS AND- THAT MIGHT BE

03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:13.795
REASONABLE IN SOME CASES BUT WE

03:11:13.862 --> 03:11:14.396
THINK KIND OF PROVIDING

03:11:14.462 --> 03:11:17.032
FUNDING. IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE

03:11:17.098 --> 03:11:17.599
FOR EXTENSION AS LITTLE BIT

03:11:17.666 --> 03:11:19.067
PREMATURE UNTIL I KIND OF WE

03:11:19.134 --> 03:11:20.135
GET TO THAT POINT AND THE

03:11:20.202 --> 03:11:20.936
ADMINISTRATION MAKES AN

03:11:21.002 --> 03:11:22.170
ARGUMENT ABOUT THE FUNDING DOES

03:11:22.237 --> 03:11:23.438
NEED TO BE EXTENDED AND THAT

03:11:23.505 --> 03:11:25.907
COULD BE REVISITED- IN AT A

03:11:25.974 --> 03:11:27.342
FUTURE DATE SO OUR

03:11:27.409 --> 03:11:28.944
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ARE TO

03:11:29.010 --> 03:11:30.979
REDUCE THE FUNDING TO FIVE

03:11:31.046 --> 03:11:31.580
MILLION TOTAL INSTEAD OF TEN

03:11:31.646 --> 03:11:34.149
MILLION- SIMILAR TO- ONE OF THE

03:11:34.216 --> 03:11:35.517
PREVIOUS ITEMS WE DON'T FEEL

03:11:35.584 --> 03:11:36.551
THAT THERE'S ARE PARTICULARLY

03:11:36.618 --> 03:11:38.286
STRONG CASE FOR IT IS NEEDING

03:11:38.353 --> 03:11:39.487
TO BE EARLY ACTION IN THE

03:11:39.554 --> 03:11:40.555
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

03:11:40.622 --> 03:11:41.656
CONSIDER PROVIDING NOT FIVE

03:11:41.723 --> 03:11:43.225
MILLION. JUST AS IT'S KIND OF

03:11:43.291 --> 03:11:45.160
OVERALL A BUDGET YEAR PACKAGE

03:11:45.227 --> 03:11:46.661
AND THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO

03:11:46.728 --> 03:11:51.766
EXPLORE SOME. OF THE DETAILS OF

03:11:51.833 --> 03:11:52.901
HOW THAT THE TIONAL PILOTS TO

03:11:52.968 --> 03:11:54.269
BE AMPLE. WHAT YOU'RE A- SAY.

03:11:54.336 --> 03:11:55.670
THE MIGHT BE ABLE. AND TYPES OF.

03:11:55.737 --> 03:11:58.173
MODEL MIGHT BE A- AND THEN.

03:11:58.240 --> 03:11:58.940
WERE RECOMMENDED THE

03:11:59.007 --> 03:12:01.276
LEGISLATURE ADOPTS- REPORTING

03:12:01.343 --> 03:12:03.345
LANGUAGE- AS PART OF BUDGET

03:12:03.411 --> 03:12:05.881
TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION- OUR

03:12:05.947 --> 03:12:07.716
INTENT HERE IS NOT TO CREATES.

03:12:07.782 --> 03:12:09.751
A LOT OF ADDITIONAL WORK FOR

03:12:09.818 --> 03:12:10.652
THE DEPARTMENT TO GIVEN THAT

03:12:10.719 --> 03:12:13.288
THESE ARE. HIGHLIGHTS ONE OF

03:12:13.355 --> 03:12:14.689
THE MAIN GOALS IS TO EVALUATE

03:12:14.756 --> 03:12:15.924
HOW EFFECTIVE SOME OF THESE

03:12:15.991 --> 03:12:17.692
DIFFERENT MODELS ARE. I DON'T

03:12:17.759 --> 03:12:18.526
UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE

03:12:18.593 --> 03:12:20.128
DEPARTMENT WILL BE COLLECTING

03:12:20.195 --> 03:12:22.230
INFORMATION ON RETENTION RATES

03:12:22.297 --> 03:12:23.865
AND COSTS OF THE PILOTS AND- I

03:12:23.932 --> 03:12:24.466
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

03:12:24.532 --> 03:12:25.100
INFORMATION FOR THE

03:12:25.166 --> 03:12:26.668
LEGISLATURE. TO HAVE GOING

03:12:26.735 --> 03:12:28.336
FORWARD AS IT CONSIDERS WHETHER

03:12:28.403 --> 03:12:31.640
OR NOT TO EXPAND SOME OF THESE

03:12:31.706 --> 03:12:33.475
MODELS- MORE BROADLY. THE STATE

03:12:33.541 --> 03:12:34.609
AND SO I MEAN SOME REPORTING

03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:35.477
LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE

03:12:35.543 --> 03:12:37.212
DEPARTMENT TO REPORT SOME OF

03:12:37.279 --> 03:12:37.913
THOSE OUTCOMES OF THE

03:12:37.979 --> 03:12:38.880
LEGISLATURE CANNABINOID

03:12:38.947 --> 03:12:40.448
PERMISSION WE THINK. OTHERWISE

03:12:40.515 --> 03:12:41.549
THIS WILL BE SANTA MONICA ALL

03:12:41.616 --> 03:12:43.451
OVER AGAIN I WOULD SAY THE

03:12:43.518 --> 03:12:45.086
FIRST OF ON BEFORE WE GET TO

03:12:45.153 --> 03:12:48.857
CENTER DOLLY- THIRTY WAGNER OR-

03:12:48.924 --> 03:12:51.660
FINANCE. ANY PROBLEM ON THE

03:12:51.726 --> 03:12:53.662
REQUEST FOR REPORTING LANGUAGE

03:12:53.728 --> 03:12:58.033
AND HOLD MY HAND HERE OF. OF

03:12:58.099 --> 03:12:59.234
ONE FIVE MORE AND LET'S SEE

03:12:59.301 --> 03:13:00.468
WILL WILL DEAL WITH THE MONEY

03:13:00.535 --> 03:13:02.237
LATER HOW DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
