. YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALREADY.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.629
LABOR LAWS THAT AFFECT ALL ALL

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:55.565
BUSINESSES INCLUDING FAST FOOD

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:57.733
THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. AND IF

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.835
SOMEONE WHO GOT HIS START IN A

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:02.171
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT. IT'S NOT A

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.440
FUN JOB BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.509
A JOB AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE LABOR

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:08.444
LAWS AND WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.913
LABOR LAWS. AS I WAS WHEN I

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.849

THINGS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:16.652
BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:19.255
FRANCHISEES THAT ARE STRUGGLING

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.490
IT RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC.

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:24.193
THIS IS NOT A GREAT TIME TO HIT

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.331
YET ANOTHER UNELECTED BOARD-

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:32.268
OVERSEE SPECIFICALLY THEM. AND

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.870
IN ADDITION TO MANY OF THE OTHER

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:35.404
AGENCIES THAT WERE ALREADY

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:38.908
POINTED OUT EARLIER. THIS IS THE

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:40.843
LIABILITY THAT IS BEING EXTENDED

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:42.578
FROM THE FRANCHISOR WILL HAVE A

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.814
CHILLING EFFECT ON BUSINESSES IN

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.351
CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE FRANCHISORS

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.386
. WILL SIMPLY NOT GRANT

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.521
BUSINESSES THE FRANCHISEES IN

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:55.124
ALIFORNIA AND YOU WILL SEE SOME

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:57.026
OF THE MOST POPULAR FRANCHISE

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:59.195
FRANCHISES GROW IN OTHER AREAS

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:01.831
AND WONDER WHY CALIFORNIA

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:04.000
DOESN'T GET TO HAVE THOSE. SO IT

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:06.002
ENTER IT JUST DRIVES ENTIRE

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:09.639
FRANCHISES. AND FRANCHISE BRANDS

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:13.042
AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA. SO IT IS

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:15.378
FOR THESE REASONS THAT I ASK YOU

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:18.481
TO CAST A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL.

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.883
AND PROTECT THE FRANCHISEES THAT

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:23.486
WE HAVE THE WORKERS HAVE THE

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:24.487
PROTECTION THEY NEED THANK YOU

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:28.224
VERY MUCH. DR QUIRK YOU ARE

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:32.128
RECOGNIZED YES- I REGRETFULLY A

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:36.132
RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWO

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:36.766
FIVE SEVEN AM I DO REGRET BEING

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.968
IN OPPOSITION. THERE IS CLEARLY

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:40.636
A PROBLEM IN THE FAST FOOD

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.538
INDUSTRY I JUST DON'T THINK

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.773
HAVING A SEPARATE SET OF

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:46.075
REGULATIONS FOR THE FAST FOOD

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:48.311
INDUSTRY IS THE WAY TO DO IT I

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:49.645
THINK ENFORCEMENT IS WHAT WE

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:52.281
NEED. I THINK THE FRANCHISORS

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:54.817
COULD HELP WITH THAT- FOR

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:56.319
EXAMPLE THIS GROUP COULD SERVE A

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:58.120
SEPARATE MINIMUM WAGE FOR FAST

01:05:58.187 --> 01:06:00.256
FOOD WORKERS OR FRANCHISE

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.491
WORKERS. AND WHY SHOULD A

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.894
FRANCHISE OF WORKERS MAKE MORE

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.662
THAN THE DISHWASHER TO SIT DOWN

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:10.466
RESTAURANT OR CHILD CARE WORKER

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.268
OR MADE AT A HOTEL. I WISH AND

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:14.003
NEWSPAPER STORIES COMPLAINING

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.905
ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT HAS

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.807
TO BE FIXED BUT THAT'S ALREADY

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:20.009
ILLEGAL. WE DON'T NEED NEW

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.912
REGULATIONS WE NEED BETTER

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:23.479
ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES WE

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:25.514
HAVE. I BELIEVE THAT THE

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:27.450
FRANCHISE OR SHOULD HAVE A ROLE

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:29.585
IN THEM FOR SHIPMENT. FOR ME TO

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.454
SUPPORT THE BILL IT NEEDS TO BE

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.623
CHANGED. TO NOT BRING SEPARATE

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:38.160
REGULATIONS. TO WHERE INDUSTRY.

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:40.096
BUT TO ENFORCE THE REGULATIONS

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.365
WE HAVE ON ALL INDUSTRIES AND IN

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.800
PARTICULAR THERE SHOULD BE A

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.869
ROLE FOR THE FRANCHISE STORES.

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:49.038
WHAT I WOULD SUPPORT HURON THE

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:50.806
FRANCHISE OR BE RESPONSIBLE IN

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.279
FOOD QUALITY AND CLEANLINESS

TRYING TO FILL THAT GAP. THIS IS

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:59.901
TRYING TO ADDRESS A COUPLE WEEKS

PEOPLE WANTED TO WORK. BUT THEY

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:11.179

WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A JOB

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:16.885

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:43.578
JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:48.049
OTHERS WHO CLEARLY ARE NOT. AND

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.819
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO STEP IN

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.088

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:12.607
PUBLIC WEIGHING IN. WILL HAVE

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:13.808
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY'LL

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:15.510
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:16.878
AND DECIDE IF THEY FEEL

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:19.714
COMFORTABLE OR NOT. THEY CAN

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:22.617

MISTAKE- EVERYONE DOESN'T DO THE

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.789

FOLKS GO DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.682
USE BOTH THEIR WEAPONS AND NEVER

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:36.717
