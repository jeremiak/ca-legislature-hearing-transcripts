BUT IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.111
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE DO IN

00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:41.346

KERRY HAS RESULTED IN THEIR

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:56.962
BEING NOW SIX FULLY OPERATIONAL

00:24:57.028 --> 00:24:59.531
ADR SEASON THE STATE AND TEN

00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:00.398
THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS A

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:02.200
MERGING WHICH MEANS A YEAR FROM

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:03.802
NOW. HOPEFULLY I'LL BE HERE

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:05.437
SAYING THEY ARE NOW SIXTEEN

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:06.304
EIGHTY ARE SEIZE FULLY

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.240
OPERATIONAL. THE CHALLENGE WE

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:10.008
HAVE IS WE THINK THIS IS JUST

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.943
EXTREMELY VALUABLE. AND IN

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.146
ORDER TO MOVE THAT NUMBER FROM

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:17.549
TEN OR SIX TO SIXTEEN AND THEN

THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:27.225
CONTINUED INVESTMENT. SO THIS

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:30.195
BUDGET ALSO IS TO CONTINUE THE

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:34.833
INVESTMENTS TO CREATE MORE ADRS

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:44.442
THESE. PROCESS ANOTHER. SO THE

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:46.177
PROPOSAL YOU'LL SEE IT'S BROKEN

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:47.445
DOWN INTO THREE YEARS WITH THAT

00:25:47.512 --> 00:25:48.880
REALIZATION NOT EVERYBODY WILL

CAME UP WITH THOSE DOLLARS THE

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:12.504
SHORT ANSWER TO IT IS THAT WE

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.706
WANT TO HAVE BASS LINE FUNDS

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:16.341

NETWORK WITH THE COMMUNITY OF

ANNUAL GROWTH ALWAYS BEEN BROWN

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:19.736
OR HAS RECENTLY BEEN 2% BUT IN

THE BUDGET IT'S RELATIVELY FLAT

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:23.874
WHEN YOU COMPARE TO EIGHTEEN

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:24.942
NINETEEN LEVELS BUT THEN ALSO

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.325
INCREASING AS WELL. SO THAT

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:49.293
MEANS THAT NOT ONLY OF COURSE

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.861
IT MORE PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF THE

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:52.729
FAMILY NEED MORE SERVICES ARE

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.831
MORE. DID OUT OF THIS INCREASE

00:48:54.898 --> 00:48:56.099
INTENSITY OR SOME OTHER THINGS

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.335
SO CAN HE SPEAK TO THAT I CAN

00:48:58.402 --> 00:48:59.069
CERTAINLY START TO IN MY OWN

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:01.471
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO WITH

00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:02.039
THE S. AND DO YOU HAVE SOME

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:05.008
DATA ON THAT. I THINK SAID A

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:07.744
PORTION OF IT COMES FROM THAT-

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.780
NOT ONLY ARE PEOPLE AGING BUT

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:10.981
ALSO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:13.250
ARE AGING AND AS PEOPLE WITH

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:16.186
DISABILITIES AGE THEN IF THERE

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:18.955
IS THAT. MORE EXTENSIVE

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:22.426
SERVICES- NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE.

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:28.165
WE ALSO ARE. SEEING MORE

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:29.066
CHILDREN OF ARE SO LIKE

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:31.601
PROTECTIVE SUPER WITH ASH

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:34.271
BURGERS AUTISM THOSE KINDS OF

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:37.507
ON DISABILITIES AND- I THINK

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.409
THOSE ARE SOME OF WHAT PLEASE

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:41.345
INTO THAT IT IS AN AREA WE ARE

00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:44.214
WEAK WE CONTINUE TO WORK IN

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.816
COLLABORATION WITH OUR COUNTY

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:49.219
IS TO ENSURE THAT- THE-

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:53.023
ASSESSMENT TOOLS ARE UTILIZED

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.693
IN A GOOD WAY. LAKE ACCURATE A

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.363
BOMB. AND SO THAT THINGS ARE

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:00.764
DONE AS CONSISTENTLY AS

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.666
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE BOARD AND

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.134

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:07.738
UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:08.872
WITH OURS WITH OUR SERVICE

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:11.041
LEVELS OKAY EMPTORIS BECAUSE

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:11.842
WE'RE MOVING TO LIKE TRYING

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.777
VISIT VERIFICATION AND I KNOW

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:14.711
WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS IN

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:16.546
THE PAST ABOUT THIS BURDENS INS

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.482
ISSUES BUT I WAS ALSO WONDERING

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:19.716
IS YOU'RE TRANSITIONING PEOPLE

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:21.485
FROM PAPER TO THE TRIBE

00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:23.253
VERIFICATION. IT SEEMS LIKE

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.355
BASED ON WHAT YOU PRESENT THAT

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:28.058
MADE IS. THE LIKE TRYING

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.293
VERIFICATION SEEM LIKE IT'S A

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.696
MORE ACTORS FIVE NOT QUITE THE

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:33.530
RIGHT WORD BUT PEOPLE ARE

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:34.731
BETTER ABLE TO DOCTOR AND

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:35.699
TONIGHT ON OF THAT SO CAUSES

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:38.735
ANY SMALL ADJUSTMENT IN. THE

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.203
HOURS IN THE CASE BECAUSE OF

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.572
YOUR BETTER ABLE TO THAT

00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:44.641
SOMETHING'S MAKE OUT SO I DON'T

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:45.842
KNOW IN TERMS OF THE PAPER

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:46.943

THAT'S A THAT'S IT SO BECAUSE

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:00.757
NEW THE ERROR A SEEMS LIKE A

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:04.795
DROPPED WHEN USED ELECTRONIC.

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:07.230
ARM I THINK THAT I DON'T KNOW

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:08.231
THAT THAT'S IMPACTED

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:10.066
NECESSARILY THAT HOURS OKAY I

00:51:10.133 --> 00:51:12.436
THINK THAT IT HAS- SUPPORTED

00:51:12.502 --> 00:51:16.339
PEOPLE IN BEING ABLE TO. TRACK

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:17.908

ERROR ON AND SO THAT'S BEEN A

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:26.650
POSITIVE THING. ALRIGHT AND LOW

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.452
QUESTION ACTUALLY FOR FINANCE

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:30.020
SO I MEAN PLEASE OF COURSE WE

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:31.621
PASS A BUDGET EACH YEAR FOR THE

00:51:31.688 --> 00:51:33.323
NEXT YEAR BUT WE ALSO IN A

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.191
BUDGETS QUESTIONS TALK ABOUT

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:36.326
OUT YEARS RIGHT WHAT NOW WHAT

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:38.562

YEARS- SO IN TERMS OF THE OUT

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:46.903
YEAR NUMBERS FOR- FOR AYE HSS

RATING IN THE- INCREASING

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:53.443
DEMOCRATS. CHANGES REALIZING

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.744
THAT MAYBE SOME POLICY CHANGES

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:56.646
IN THE FUTURE BUT STILL YOU

00:51:56.713 --> 00:51:58.114
KNOW WE'RE- SO I MEAN WHAT'S

00:51:58.181 --> 00:51:59.583
THE PROJECTED GROSS OF AYE TO

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:01.284
ASSESS YEAR BY YEAR OVER INTO

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:04.387
THE OUT YEARS. SO WE DO NOT

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.990
SPECIFICALLY- YOU KNOW FACTOR

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:10.861
IN DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES. BUT

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:13.196
WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT- YOU

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:14.965

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:17.267
TRACKS WITH WITH MEDI CAL

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:20.604
ESSENTIALLY SO- AS YOU KNOW.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.305
BECAUSE BECAUSE GENERALLY THE

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:24.641
WAY INTO I JUST **** THROUGH

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:27.577
THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. SO WHAT

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:29.446
WE GENERALLY DO IS WE LOOK AT

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:31.414
THE TRANS- THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:34.284
AT THE TRENDS AND HOW HOW CASE.

00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:35.886
HAS INCREASINGLY WHAT.

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:38.855
PROJECTED GO YOU KNOW WHAT

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:40.891
WE'RE BRIDGE BAY ON. CHANGES

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:44.160
BUT GENERALLY NO WE DO NOT- YOU

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:47.330
KNOW FACTOR IN DEMOGRAPHICS-

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:49.633
IT'S HARD TO PREDICT- YOU KNOW

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:53.303
WHO. IS GOING TO BE USING I HSS

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:56.139
IT- WE KNOW THAT WITH THE AGING

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.874
POPULATION THERE WILL YOU KNOW

00:52:57.941 --> 00:53:00.744
THERE ARE GOING TO BE- PROBABLY

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.480
MORE- PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE. BUT

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:05.081
AS MISS THOMPSON WAS SAYING WE

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.117
ALSO HAVE- YOU KNOW THIS

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:09.386
POPULATION ARE HIGHER-

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:11.221
POPULATION OF. ON THE BILL AT

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:12.656
THE SITE COMING INTO THIS

00:53:12.722 --> 00:53:15.158
PROGRAM SO YOUNGER- POPULATION

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:19.162
WITH HIRE ME. THE PROGRAM HAS

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:21.798
BEEN GROWING PRETTY STEADILY

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.100
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- I

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:26.469
THINK- IT THAT TREND IS

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:29.039
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS WE MOVE

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:32.542
FORWARD OKAY SO I GUESS THIS IS

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:33.877
THE IS A MORE CONCRETE QUESTION

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.979
IS THAT AS WERE LOOKING AT OUT

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.548
YEARS WHAT IS THE PROJECTED

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.817
GROSS THAT YOU'RE USING THAT

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.786
FINANCES USING AND MAYBE LA-

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:44.321
CAN ALSO ANSWER WHETHER LA IS

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:46.423
LOOKING AT IS WE'RE JUST YOU

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:47.791
KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.159
BUDGET IS ABOUT NEXT YEAR BUT

00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:51.561
THEN YOU SAY WELL LOOK AT YOUR-

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:53.630
IMPACTS SO. WHAT THREE. USING

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:55.131
FOR PROJECTIONS FOR THE I GUESS

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:56.566
THAT WE GOT LIKE FIVE YEARS I

00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.468
THINK. FIVE YEAR ELLIS THOUGH

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:00.737
YEARS TWO THREE OBVIOUSLY I CAN

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.972
CHANGE WITH NEW INFORMATION

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:03.440
THAT'S- EVEN DO MAY REVIE FOR

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:05.241
THE SAME YEAR BUT I MEAN WHAT.

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:07.777
WHAT GROWTH ARE WE PLANNING FOR

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:10.614
AND I'D JUST US- AS WE'RE GOING

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.617
AS WE- TALK ABOUT THESE OUT

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:17.487
YOUR PROJECTIONS. TO WE ARE WE

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:18.555
ARE PROJECTING SIGNIFICANT

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:20.523
GROWTH I APOLOGIZE YOU DON'T

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.592
HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN FRONT

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:23.226
OF ME BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY GET

00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:25.629
BACK TO YOU- GENERALLY THIS

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:29.432
PROGRAM COST WISE- SINCE. YOU

00:54:29.499 --> 00:54:31.668
KNOW THAT. I WOULD SAY PROBABLY

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:33.737
OVER THE LAST- TEN YEARS IS

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:36.473
PROBABLY ON- THAT TOTAL

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:37.507
EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN GROWING

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:40.343
AROUND LIKE A 10211% CLIP

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.713
ANNUALLY- AGAIN WE WILL YOU

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.281
KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT CERTAIN

00:54:45.348 --> 00:54:48.218
POLICY CHANGES SO THE RECENT-

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:49.152
CHANGE IN THE COUNTY I. SYSTEM

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:51.621
A WE- ARMENIANS ABOUT LEVEL

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.790
THAT IS GOING TO THAT FACTORS

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:56.126
IN TO OUR GROWTH FACTOR. UP TO

00:54:56.192 --> 00:54:58.461
OUR- THE INCREASED COST TO THE

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:01.898
STATE. IT'S YOU KNOW AGAIN A

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:04.134
LOT OF IT IS ALSO BASED OFF THE

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.604
GROWTH IN THE SLOPE THAT WE SEE

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:10.073
AND I THINK WERE SOMEWHERE IN

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.542
THE- 5% ANNUALLY- IS WHAT THE

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:14.477
CASELOAD HAS BEEN GROWING BY.

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:16.012
US ALL THOSE FACTORS GO INTO

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.815
IT- I CAN'T I DON'T HAVE THE

00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:20.717
NUMBERS HERE I DON'T KNOW IF MY

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:22.385
COLLEAGUE LA- DOES BUT WE CAN

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:24.187
WE CAN DEFINITELY GET BACK TO

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:25.321
YOU ABOUT WHAT WERE. WHAT WE

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.690
THINK THE GROWTH RATE IS OVER

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:28.158
THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IN TERMS

00:55:28.224 --> 00:55:29.693
OF EXPENDITURES OKAY SO I

00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:32.729
THINK- THAT IS ALWAYS HOPEFUL

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:33.630
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.198
THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WELL WE

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:37.467
CAN'T YOU KNOW WE'RE- NO ONE

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:39.836
TIMERS IS ON GOING WHAT'S- HOW

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.004
MUCH DO WE HAVE ON GOING IT

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:43.173
CETERA AND- I'D- NOTE. GIVEN

00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:43.673
THE PREVIOUS WORK OF THE

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.141
SUBCOMMITTEE SAYING THAT WE

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:46.076
NEED TO INCORPORATE THE

00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:47.744
DEMOGRAPHICS THE REALIZE

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:48.778
DEMOCRATS IS ONLY ONE FACTOR OF

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:49.813
MANY AND HOW MUCH WOULD

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:54.617
ACTUALLY SPEND- BUT I THINK IT

00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:55.218
IS SOMETHING THAT. WE WANT TO

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:58.154
BE YEAH. WELL IT'S ACTORS WHICH-

00:55:58.221 --> 00:55:59.723
PROJECTIONS WHERE WE'RE GOING

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:04.227
TO GO- IT DAILY AT THE ONE A

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:07.697
COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL.

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:09.466
AS PART OF OUR ALSO FISCAL

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:10.834
FORECAST THAT WE DO NOVEMBER

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.902
AND THEN ALSO IN MAY- WE ALSO

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.504
LOOK AT TO PROGRAM GROWTH I

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:15.371
THINK SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU'RE

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:16.873
MENTIONING IS IT'S NOT JUST

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.007
CASELOAD IT'S THE POLICY

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.709
IMPACTS AND ACCOUNTING FOR

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:21.511
THOSE AND WHEN WE DO LOOK AT

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:24.347
THOSE IN THE OUT YEARS WE TRIED

WITHOUT AGREEMENTS AND A SAID

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.411
SOMEONE TO GO SHE IN CENTER I

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:36.645
MEAN WE HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT THE

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.881
MEDIA AND OUR-  MEAN IS OF.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.249
THE TIME THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:41.851
WITHOUT AGREEMENTS. YEAH I

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.852
WOULD DEFINITELY ESTIMATE IT'S

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:44.687
PROBABLY BEEN- SEVERAL YEARS

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:46.021
SOME THAT. YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF

01:08:46.088 --> 01:08:47.590
JUST EXPIRED IN THE PAST YEAR

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:49.758
AT NO CINEMA STANISLAUS. MARINE

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:51.260
AS A LIVING WAGE JORDAN SO THAT

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:52.394
ACTIVELY DOING WAGE INCREASES

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:53.395
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A CURRENT

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.663
AGREEMENTS. AND THEN THERE

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.865
CERTAINLY ARE SOME THAT WOULD

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:57.733
BE IN THE SITUATION OF THE- THE

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.767
NEW AGREEMENT SUGGESTS BEEN

01:08:58.834 --> 01:08:59.635
REACH WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WITH

AN EXPIRED AGREEMENT FOR A

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.339
NUMBER OF YEARS- YEAH. I DON'T

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.141
THEM. OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK

01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:07.710
THAT'S THE CONCERN I REALIZE

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:09.245
THAT WE- WE CREATE THIS PROCESS

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:10.846

AGREEMENT IN YEARS AND- DOCTOR

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:18.854
NOT CLOSE TO GETTING ONE

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.689
THAT'S- THAT'S PROBLEMATIC.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:21.156
YEAH I KNOW CERTAINLY

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.458
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THERE

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:23.792
WE'RE- DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:24.927
SEEING THAT CONTINUE GRAHAM

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.629
IT'S I KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL.

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:27.630

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.265
INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES WHEN THE

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.399
UNIONS HAVE HAVE COME TO US

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:31.567
WITH SPECIFIC CONCERNS THEY

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:32.368
HAVE ABOUT THIS YOU CAN GET

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:33.802
INVOLVED IN BARGAINING. BUT WE

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:34.670

AVAILABLE. AND YOU KNOW. IT'S

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:39.575
AND CERTAIN SITUATIONS

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.310
BARGAINING TAKES TIME SEEN

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:42.211
FOURTEEN NEW AGREEMENTS IN JULY

WHERE WE NEED TO BE I WOULD SAY

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.929
THAT'S NO- WHAT WE HANDED OUT

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:55.497
ARE HANDING OUT RIGHT NOW IS

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.467

SEE THAT COUNTIES IN YELLOW WE

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:07.476
HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:09.711
THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING- VIEW

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.346
COUNTY WHERE JUSTIN IS FROM

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:14.449
GOES SPECIFICALLY BACK TO TWO

01:19:14.516 --> 01:19:14.983
THOUSAND FOURTEEN SO WE'RE

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.351
LOOKING AT GOING ON SIX YEARS

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.854
THERE- SOME OF THESE ARE JUST

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.623
REALLY. DIFFICULT SITUATIONS

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.493
THAT I DON'T SEE RESOLUTION

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:26.228
HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON THE

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:26.995
OTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.196
RAISE IS EVEN IF WE HAVE

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.764
REACHED AGREEMENTS IN IN SOME

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:31.466
OF THESE OTHER PLACES. WE'RE

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:33.101
LOOKING AT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:34.269
FOR FIFTY CENTS ABOVE THE

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.171
MINIMUM WAGE. AND THAT'S-

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.239
PURELY BECAUSE THAT IS THE

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.174
ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WAS GOING TO

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:41.843
HAPPEN. AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:45.213
ONLY 10% OF THE WORKERS THAT WE

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.415
REPRESENT GET HEALTH BENEFITS

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:49.384
THROUGH THEIR CONTRACT MEANING

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:52.020
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY LIKELY

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.989
OR ON MEDI CAL. AND SO THESE

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:56.158
ARE THE WORKING POOR THESE ARE

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:57.759
THE POPULATIONS THAT WORK FULL

01:19:57.826 --> 01:19:59.494
TIME AND ARE STILL ON PUBLIC

01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:01.630
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SO IN LIGHT

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:03.465
OF THAT. AND IN LIGHT OF THE

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:04.766
FACT THAT THERE IS A CRISIS IN

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.501
TERMS OF WORK FORCE RECRUITING

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:08.937
AND RETAINING IN AYE HSS THAT I

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:09.838
BELIEVE ANY CLIENT COULD SPEAK

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:11.673
TO. IT BUT A SPECIFICALLY

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:12.507
CLIENTS WHO DON'T HAVE FAMILY

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:15.177
PROVIDERS WE WANT TO SEE THE

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:16.945
PENALTY AMOUNT INCREASE FOR

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:19.981
COUNTIES THAT ARE. NOT

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:22.050
NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH SO AS

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:27.155
WE TALKED. HOLDING THAT WAS IT-

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:28.490
PASSED LAST YEAR WOULD LIKE TO

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.859
SEE THAT BECOME A 7%

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:32.460
WITHHOLDING AND HAVE IT BE

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:34.095
ANNUAL MEANING THAT SO LONG AS

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:36.398
IT REMAINS OUTSTANDING EVERY

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:36.965
YEAR THEY WOULD FACE ANOTHER

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:39.734
WITHHOLDING WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:42.070
SEE. TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:44.739
TAXPAYER DOLLARS- FOR EXAMPLE

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.107
WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:47.676
BARGAINING AS I MENTIONED IF

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:48.910
YOU COUNTY FOR GOING ON SIX

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:51.947
YEARS. THAT RETAIN A LAW FIRMS

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:53.481
THAT ARE NEGOTIATING ON THEIR

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:56.651
BEHALF- I CAN'T IMAGINE IN SIX

01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:57.652
YEARS HOW MUCH OF THOSE

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:59.654
RETAINERS ADD UP TO. AND HOW

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.790
MUCH DOES THAT COME RELATIVE TO

01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:03.358
WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING TO

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:05.493
GET FOR FOLKS. AND IT'S BEEN

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.028
DIFFICULT WE HAVE FILED

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:08.129
NUMEROUS PUBLIC INFORMATION

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:11.132
REQUESTS- WHAT WE GET IS PIECES

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:14.402
OF INFORMATION OR JUST BROAD-

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:16.504
LINE ITEM EXPENDITURES IT'S

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:18.139
HARD TO PARCEL EXACTLY HOW MUCH

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:19.741
IS BEING SPENT ON AYE HSS

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:22.110
NEGOTIATIONS SPECIFICALLY. WE

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:24.512
THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE FACT

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.815
THAT THIS PHENOMENON. OF

01:21:26.881 --> 01:21:28.617
RETAINING THESE OUTSIDE VENDORS

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.452
AND THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:32.487
HONESTLY AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:33.321
TO NEVER NEGOTIATE BECAUSE

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.356
THEY'LL JUST KEEP COLLECTING

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:35.857
THEIR RETAINERS AS LONG AS THIS

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:37.892
KEEPS GOING. WE NEED TO HAVE

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:39.628
TRANSPARENCY HOW MUCH IS BEING

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.730
SPENT. AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:43.732
LIKE IN RELATION TO WHAT THE

01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:45.100
ACTUAL COST WOULD BE TO JUST

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:47.135
SETTLE THE CONTRACT. SO THERE'S

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:49.871
A PERVERSE INCENTIVE THERE-

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:52.040
WE'D LIKE TO SEE A AN ACTION

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.808
REVERSE THAT AS TAKEN LAST

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.010
YEAR WHICH IS THAT ONCE THE

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.645
MINIMUM WAGE IT'S FIFTEEN

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:59.781
DOLLARS. THE COST RATIOS SO THE

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:02.150
SHARE OF COSTS WILL FLIP. WE'RE

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:04.953
THE COUNTIES WILL NOW PICK UP

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.521
65% OF THE NON FEDERAL SHARE

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:07.722
AND THE STATE WOULD PICK UP

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:09.424
THIRTY FIVE. SO THAT'S THE

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.660
OPPOSITE OF WHAT EXISTS NOW.

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:12.861
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY ON

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.396
THAT IS IF WE THINK IT'S HARD

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:16.698
NOW. IT'LL BE A HUNDRED TIMES

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.900
HARDER WHEN THIS POLICY IS

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:20.502
ENACTED ANYTHING THAT WOULD

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:21.870
INCREASE COSTS ON THE COUNTY

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:23.705
AND WOULD ONLY MAKE IT MORE

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.640
DIFFICULT TO GET CONTRACTS. AND

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.008
THEN THAT'S ALSO HOLDING TRUE

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.376
ON THE XCELERATED CASE LOW

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:29.978
GROWTH ALLOCATIONS THAT'S JUST

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:33.548
A REALLY FANCY WORD FOR WE NEED

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.049
TO GET THE MONEY FASTER.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:34.916
BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER MAJOR

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:36.117
PROBLEM THAT ALWAYS COMES UP IN

01:22:36.184 --> 01:22:38.219
NEGOTIATION SO I'LL WRAP UP

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:41.222
WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:43.391

COUNTIES ARGUING WILL WE GET AN

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.908
AGREEMENT LAST YEAR RIGHT AND

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:01.343
THERE ARE PROVISIONS PUT IN TO

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:02.410
TRY TO MOVE PEOPLE TO

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:04.746
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:10.385

AFFECTED THIS OR AND

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:17.559
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROVISIONS

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:19.361
WE DID SO THEIR ARGUMENT IS

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:20.395
THAT WELL LOOK ON THE MIDDLE OF

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:21.563
THIS RIGHT AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:23.098
MORE CONTRACTS WE READ BEFORE

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.032
BUT YOU KNOW AS YOU POINTED OUT

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:25.633
THERE STILL LIVES SOMEWHERE IN

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.969
TAX RATE. SO HOW CAN YOU CAN

01:23:28.036 --> 01:23:31.039

RIGHT. GIVE A LITTLE LONGER-

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:37.479
IT'S HOW DO YOU SEE THAT THE

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:39.714
CURRENT NECK AND WHAT WE GREW

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:40.348
TO LAST YEAR IS SOMETHING

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:42.550
THAT'S- HEADED TOWARD FAILURE

DO YOU TO SPEAK TO WHO- WHY THE

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:51.159

YEAR. I WOULD ARGUE THAT

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.002
THERE'S A LOT MORE IN ADDITION

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.437
TO THE WITHHOLDING THAT'S GOING

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:04.672
ON THAT'S RESULTING IN

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:07.175
CONTRACTS GETTING- FINALIZED I

THAT SIMPLY THE FIRST TO FALL

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.665
BECAUSE THE ONLY THIS IS THE

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:53.100

IN THAT WAY. WE DON'T DO IT A

01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:58.739

SO THAT YOU KNOW SO BASICALLY

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:05.479
THAT TRIGGER WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:07.381
PULL THE TRIGGER IT JUST

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:09.082
AUTOMATICALLY HAPPENS. SO I

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:12.085
DON'T I AM. HI I HOPE WE CAN

01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:14.187
HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT

01:43:14.254 --> 01:43:16.023
THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE LARGER

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:17.591
DISCUSSION WITH LIKE THE FULL

01:43:17.658 --> 01:43:19.226

01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:23.063
I REALLY HAVE A TREMENDOUS

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:25.666
DISCOMFORT WITH THE IDEA THAT

01:43:25.732 --> 01:43:27.367
WE YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT

01:43:27.434 --> 01:43:28.435
THIS AND WE CAN SAID WELL

01:43:28.502 --> 01:43:29.503
DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN UNTIL

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.805
NEXT YEAR OR SO LITTLE AT ALL

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:33.106
IT'S NOT GONNA REALLY HAPPEN

01:43:33.173 --> 01:43:34.575
IT'S GOT MORE ON PAPER AND YES

01:43:34.641 --> 01:43:36.443
WE CAN PUSH IT OUT PAPER BUT-

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:38.345
AT SOME POINT WHAT WE ARE

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:40.180
SAYING THAT IS THAT WE SET UP

01:43:40.247 --> 01:43:41.548
ALL THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDING

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:43.050

FIVE YEAR PROJECTION WE BUILD

01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:53.660
IN AND WE SAY GUESS WHAT. SO

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.228
THAT IS SO WE'RE NOT BUT WE

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:56.463
DON'T DO THAT UNIVERSALLY

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:58.498
ACROSS THE BOARD WHICH HAS TO

01:43:58.565 --> 01:43:59.066
IT FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND

01:43:59.132 --> 01:44:00.667
THEY ALL SEEM TO BE. SOCIAL

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:03.804
SERVICE PROGRAMS SO. YOU KNOW.

01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:06.306
THAT I COULD SELL- THIS IS OUR

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:07.507

WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. NOW IS

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:22.055
THIS THE IN OUR BUDGETING

01:44:22.122 --> 01:44:25.225

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:25.212

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:30.917
REFLECTED IN THESE AREAS. I

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:31.985

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:34.821

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:37.224
WHERE CAN WE- IF WE HAVE TO

MAKE REDUCTIONS WHERE CAN WE

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:41.695
MAKE REDUCTIONS NOW I THINK

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:42.462
DEFINITELY WORKING WITH

01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:44.264

HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:56.610

BE HAPPY- IN THE NEAR FUTURE-

01:47:00.213 --> 01:47:03.083

W. BARGAINING PROPOSALS A

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:46.526
LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:47.360
PERSPECTIVE PRIOR TO

01:57:47.427 --> 01:57:49.896
BARGAINING- THE LEGISLATURE HAD

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:52.632
OPTIONS- TO IMPOSE BARGAINING

01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:53.633
ON COUNTIES OR TO DO THE

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.835
BARGAINING YOURSELVES. THE

01:57:55.902 --> 01:57:56.969
UNIONS RECOMMENDED LOCAL

01:57:57.036 --> 01:57:59.739
BARGAINING WE RECOMMENDED STATE

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:01.507
BARGAINING AND WE LOST. MANY OF

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:03.176
THE REASONS THAT WE ARGUED FOR

01:58:03.242 --> 01:58:04.210
BY STATE BARGAINING WOULD BE

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:06.946
SUPERIOR ARE MANIFEST IN THE

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:08.681
DEBATE WE'RE HAVING OVER WHAT

01:58:08.748 --> 01:58:10.716
THE BARGAINING RULES ARE. IF AT

01:58:10.783 --> 01:58:12.819
SOME POINT THE STATE'S FOR-

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:15.054
ROLE IN LOCAL BARGAINING IS TO

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:16.456
IS TO DICTATE THE TERMS NOT THE

01:58:16.522 --> 01:58:18.224
OUTCOME. IF WE WANT TO GET TO

01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:19.926
THE POINT WHERE WE BELIEVE AS A

01:58:19.992 --> 01:58:21.761
MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY. THAT

01:58:21.828 --> 01:58:23.362
THERE'S A PREDETERMINED OUTCOME

01:58:23.429 --> 01:58:25.865
AND THAT IS A GREATER FLOOR OF

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:27.900
WAGES FOR EVERYONE WHO DELIVERS

01:58:27.967 --> 01:58:30.036
AYE HSS WAGES. LOCAL BARGAINING

01:58:30.102 --> 01:58:31.537
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:32.705
ACCOMPLISH THAT YOU CAN

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:34.874
ESTABLISH THAT IN LAW. YOU CAN

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:37.076
ALSO HAVE BARGAINING DONE AT

01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:38.244
THE STATE LEVEL RATHER THAN THE

01:58:38.311 --> 01:58:40.146
LOCAL LEVEL THOSE TWO

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:42.548
APPROACHES. IN OUR OPINION DO

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:44.183
REQUIRE THE STATE PAY MORE THAN

01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:45.785
THEY OTHERWISE WOULD. BUT I

01:58:45.852 --> 01:58:46.919
JUSTWANTED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.588
THE FACT THAT LOCAL BARGAINING

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:50.223
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO CONCEIVE

01:58:50.289 --> 01:58:51.958

IN OUR IN OUR OPINION AS THIS

01:58:57.063 --> 01:58:58.965
PROPOSAL WOULD TO. DICTATE NOT

01:58:59.031 --> 01:58:59.866

ACTUALLY INCREASING CAPACITY OF

THOSE FACILITY TIES BUT FOR

02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:38.235
THOSE THAT ARE CARING

TO THERE ARE SOME AND I THINK

02:39:48.345 --> 02:39:49.846
YOUR AGENDA SPEAKS TO IT A

02:39:49.913 --> 02:39:50.981
LITTLE BIT LATER AROUND SOME OF

02:39:51.048 --> 02:39:53.183
THAT- THE- WAYS IN WHICH WE

02:39:53.250 --> 02:39:54.685
HAVE. ESSENTIALLY A PROXY TO

02:39:54.751 --> 02:39:55.752
LOOK AT THE DATA MATCHING

02:39:55.819 --> 02:39:57.955
BETWEEN WHO'S WHO'S IN A

02:39:58.021 --> 02:39:59.189
RESIDENT IN THOSE FACILITY

02:39:59.256 --> 02:40:00.424
TYPES IN WHOSE RECEIVING A

02:40:00.490 --> 02:40:02.526
SOCIETY PROXY THAT WERE USING-

02:40:02.592 --> 02:40:04.328
BUT I CAN CERTAINLY I'M SURE

02:40:04.394 --> 02:40:05.729
WITH THE SPECIFIC DATA AT THE

02:40:05.796 --> 02:40:07.331
STATE LEVEL FOR A FEW PEOPLE

02:40:07.397 --> 02:40:08.799
LIKE THAT OUR OR LATER ON IN

02:40:08.865 --> 02:40:10.534
THE AGENDA BUT CERTAINLY WE ARE

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:13.070
SEEING A DECLINE SPECIFIC TO-

02:40:13.136 --> 02:40:15.405
WHEEZING THAT PROXY MEASURE OF

02:40:15.472 --> 02:40:16.873
THE NUMBER OF THOSE FACILITY

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:18.342
TYPES AND CASSIE THIS FACILITY

02:40:18.408 --> 02:40:20.510
TYPES THAT ARE SERVING THE SS I

02:40:20.577 --> 02:40:22.879
SS BE POPULATION. OKAY WELL I

02:40:22.946 --> 02:40:23.780
MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WAS

02:40:23.847 --> 02:40:25.716
WERE TRANSCRIPTS HOMELESSNESS

02:40:25.782 --> 02:40:29.686
AND HOUSING- I THINK WE NEED TO

02:40:29.753 --> 02:40:32.889
LOOK AT HOW YOU KNOW HOW THE

02:40:32.956 --> 02:40:35.826
POPULATION IS ON SSI SSD IS

02:40:35.892 --> 02:40:37.928
BEING IMPACTED IN ORDER TO

02:40:37.995 --> 02:40:43.600
THINKS THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO

02:40:43.667 --> 02:40:45.335
THE GATE DOBBS YEAH WE ARE

02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:47.070
OTHER A LOT THE WELL. PROGRAMS

02:40:47.137 --> 02:40:47.938
PROPOSALS AROUND HOUSING ALSO

02:40:48.005 --> 02:40:48.939
JUST STRUCK THAT. YOU KNOW

02:40:49.006 --> 02:40:50.407
WE'RE LOSING CARE CARE BOARDING

02:40:50.474 --> 02:40:52.209
HOMES FOR PEOPLE ON SSI ASSIST

02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:56.113
P. AND- ALLOWING A DUE TO STUDY

02:40:56.179 --> 02:40:58.281
I DON'T. THE CASELOAD IS MAYBE

02:40:58.348 --> 02:40:59.916
DROPPING BUT I AND I DON'T

02:40:59.983 --> 02:41:01.852
THINK THAT- THAT ACCOUNTS FOR

02:41:01.918 --> 02:41:04.955
WHY WE HAVE A TEACHER THAT WE

02:41:05.022 --> 02:41:05.589
HAVE A DECREASE IN BEDS RIGHT.

02:41:05.655 --> 02:41:07.124
RIGHT SO WE BELIEVE IN

02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:09.192
CERTAINLY IN THE S. SURVEYS

02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:10.727
THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS

02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:12.062
CONDUCTED ON WHY SOME OF THOSE

02:41:12.129 --> 02:41:13.563
FACILITIES AT CLOSE THEY HAVE

02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:15.332
ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED. AT THIS

02:41:15.399 --> 02:41:17.000
RATE AS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

02:41:17.067 --> 02:41:18.535
THEY ASH STRUGGLED WITH AND

02:41:18.602 --> 02:41:20.137
WHICH CHALLENGED WITH PART OF

02:41:20.203 --> 02:41:22.706
OUR PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME IS

02:41:22.773 --> 02:41:25.075
THE HOUSING- THAT'S ASSIST

02:41:25.142 --> 02:41:28.078
HOUSING FUND- WHICH- ONE OF

02:41:28.145 --> 02:41:29.413
THREE PURPOSES OF THE FUND IS

02:41:29.479 --> 02:41:31.515
SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS-

02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:33.550
STABILIZING. PICKED THE CARE OF

02:41:33.617 --> 02:41:35.118
THIS POPULATION IN THOSE

02:41:35.185 --> 02:41:37.120
FACILITY TYPES AND SO AGAIN-

02:41:37.187 --> 02:41:39.322
BASED ON THE NEEDS THAT IN ANY

02:41:39.389 --> 02:41:41.658
GIVEN REGION. THIS WILL BE ONE

02:41:41.725 --> 02:41:42.793
OF THOSE THREE ALLOWABLE USES

02:41:42.859 --> 02:41:45.128
OF THE FUN AT TO SUPPORT BOTH.

02:41:45.195 --> 02:41:48.031
A POTENTIAL- STABILIZING RENTER

02:41:48.098 --> 02:41:49.199
HAVING A RENTAL AGREEMENT

02:41:49.266 --> 02:41:51.234
EXCHANGE BUT ALSO FOR. A

02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:53.070
POTENTIALLY IN THE-

02:41:53.136 --> 02:41:54.805
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE FACILITIES

02:41:54.871 --> 02:41:55.772
THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO ENSURE

02:41:55.839 --> 02:42:00.477
THAT THE TO HIGH QUALITY THE

02:42:00.544 --> 02:42:02.979
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION.

02:42:03.046 --> 02:42:04.381
UNDER THE OVERVIEW IS YEAH WE

02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:08.718
WERE- SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO-

02:42:08.785 --> 02:42:11.288
BASICALLY GET. ALLOW PEOPLE

02:42:11.354 --> 02:42:14.858
UNNECESSARY S. P. TO GET ON- A

02:42:14.925 --> 02:42:18.628
CAL FRESH RIGHT- AND- SO I JUST

02:42:18.695 --> 02:42:19.996
WANT TO CHECK IN IN TERMS OF

02:42:20.063 --> 02:42:21.832
THE FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND DOES

02:42:21.898 --> 02:42:23.834
SO MANY TOPICS TO READ THEIR

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:25.635
OWN ALSO PERSPECTIVE AS WELL

02:42:25.702 --> 02:42:27.771
BUT FROM- SO HAS A HOUSE THAT

02:42:27.838 --> 02:42:29.339
IMPLEMENTATION IN ROLLING OUT

02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:30.974
I'VE BEEN GOING GOING IT'S

02:42:31.041 --> 02:42:32.809
BEEN- PHENOMENAL AND WE ARE

02:42:32.876 --> 02:42:34.544
GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP OF

02:42:34.611 --> 02:42:35.612
OUR COUNTIES MANY BOOKS

02:42:35.679 --> 02:42:37.981
ORGANIZATIONS WE HAD A VERY.

02:42:38.048 --> 02:42:39.749
ROBUST ENGAGEMENT ENGAGE

02:42:39.816 --> 02:42:41.184
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THROUGHOUT

02:42:41.251 --> 02:42:42.686
THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION

02:42:42.752 --> 02:42:45.155
SO FAR INCLUDING ADDITIONAL

02:42:45.222 --> 02:42:46.389
RESOURCES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN

02:42:46.456 --> 02:42:47.757
THE BUDGET TO MAKE SURE WE WERE

02:42:47.824 --> 02:42:50.360
DOING OUTREACH AT A GREATER

02:42:50.427 --> 02:42:52.529
RATE HAS AND SO THAT THAT HAS

02:42:52.596 --> 02:42:54.631
BEEN SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE- OVER

02:42:54.698 --> 02:42:55.866
WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED

02:42:55.932 --> 02:42:57.934
THOUSAND- INDIVIDUALS IN THIS

02:42:58.001 --> 02:42:59.469
POPULATION AND ROLLED AND THAT

02:42:59.536 --> 02:43:01.471
NUMBER CONTINUES TO GROW SO-

02:43:01.538 --> 02:43:02.739
AGAIN JUST GRATEFUL FOR THE

02:43:02.806 --> 02:43:04.274
PARTNERSHIP ACROSS THE BOARD TO

02:43:04.341 --> 02:43:06.243
MAKE THAT A SUCCESSFUL IN AND

02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:08.011
IT HAS IT HAS BEEN JUST THAT SO

02:43:08.078 --> 02:43:10.981
WILL. NOT DONE THE BEST AT

02:43:11.047 --> 02:43:13.517
PHENOMENAL SO THAT WORK I ONE

02:43:13.583 --> 02:43:14.818
THINK THAT THE AND CERTAINLY

02:43:14.885 --> 02:43:17.487
THE PUT YOUR PARTNER FOR MAKING

02:43:17.554 --> 02:43:20.123

AGREEMENT AND ATTACK LIMIT THIS

02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:33.403
AND I THINK THIS SOME THAT

02:43:33.470 --> 02:43:37.607
GOING TO FIT. ALMOST HOUSEHOLD

02:43:37.674 --> 02:43:41.111

ACTUALLY START TO FUND THE

03:00:30.419 --> 03:00:32.054
INCREASES I'M TWO THINGS I

03:00:32.121 --> 03:00:33.455
WOULD JUST PULL OUT OF THE DATA

03:00:33.522 --> 03:00:36.358
THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED ME

03:00:36.425 --> 03:00:37.693
ONE IS THAT SINCE THE CUTS WERE

03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:39.562
FIRST ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND

03:00:39.628 --> 03:00:41.964

S. S. P. GRANT ONCE ONCE IN

03:00:44.633 --> 03:00:47.102
THAT ENTIRE TIME PERIOD. AND SO

I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER I

03:00:49.505 --> 03:00:50.806
THINK EVEN IF THEY'RE GOING TO

03:00:50.873 --> 03:00:53.142
BE SMALL STEPS CONTINUING TO

03:00:53.209 --> 03:00:55.377

03:00:55.444 --> 03:00:57.079
THE WHOLE BIGGER EVERY YEAR

03:00:57.146 --> 03:00:59.081
THAT WE TRY TO DO THIS SO WE

03:00:59.148 --> 03:01:00.916
NEED TO START DOING SOMETHING.

03:01:00.983 --> 03:01:01.650
AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD

03:01:01.717 --> 03:01:03.586
NOTE IS THAT THE DROP IN THE

03:01:03.652 --> 03:01:05.387

03:14:28.390 --> 03:14:30.392
GIVING US A AT A HOLISTIC VIEW

03:14:30.458 --> 03:14:33.294
TO BE ABLE TO. FOCUS ON THERE'S

03:14:33.361 --> 03:14:38.299
THOSE AREAS OF. NON COMPLIANCE.

03:14:38.366 --> 03:14:43.905
RIGHT HELLO. FINANCE WE

03:14:43.972 --> 03:14:46.408
APPRECIATE THE UPDATE ON THE

03:14:46.474 --> 03:14:49.577
TOOL NOW. AS WE MOVED FROM

03:14:49.644 --> 03:14:52.847
KßT TO- TO THE NEW INSPECTION

03:14:52.914 --> 03:14:54.649
TOOLS WERE STILL USED IT'S

03:14:54.716 --> 03:14:56.084
STILL BASED ON THE MODEL OF

03:14:56.151 --> 03:15:00.121
RATE OF HAVING- SERVE I GUESS

03:15:00.188 --> 03:15:01.856
TRIGGER BASICALLY YOU HAVE SOME

03:15:01.923 --> 03:15:04.192
INITIAL ELEMENTS IF THOSE TURN

03:15:04.259 --> 03:15:06.227
OUT NOT TO GO SO WELL THEN IT

03:15:06.294 --> 03:15:07.362
DELVES IN MORE DEEPLY CORRECT

03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:09.030
YES RIGHT IT'S A DELL MAIN

03:15:09.097 --> 03:15:10.632
FOCUS RIGHT TOOL THAT IS

03:15:10.698 --> 03:15:11.833
DIFFERENT THAN THE CAT SO IT'S

03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:13.535
BEST PACIFIC LEAD DEVELOPED

03:15:13.601 --> 03:15:14.469
OVER THE ARTICLES IN THE

03:15:14.536 --> 03:15:17.906
REGULATION SO YOU CAN DO A DEEP

03:15:17.972 --> 03:15:19.908
DIVE FOR THE- NON. WELL I GUESS

03:15:19.974 --> 03:15:24.012
WHEN THE MY QUESTIONS I HAD-

03:15:24.079 --> 03:15:26.114
THOUGHTS WAS IS THAT- CERTAINLY

03:15:26.181 --> 03:15:27.882
IS CO BOTH WHEN YOU DID KITTEN

03:15:27.949 --> 03:15:31.419
AND NOW WITH THIS NEW TOOL- AND

03:15:31.486 --> 03:15:32.654
I KNOW YOU COLLECTED DATA TO

03:15:32.720 --> 03:15:33.588
LOOK AT WHICH PARTICULAR

03:15:33.655 --> 03:15:35.290
QUESTIONS WOULD BEST REFLECT

03:15:35.356 --> 03:15:37.158
THAT THE MAIN RATE. SO THAT

03:15:37.225 --> 03:15:38.159
YOU'D SAID OF DOING EVERYTHING

03:15:38.226 --> 03:15:40.528
YOU COULD DO- BUT- I WOULD

03:15:40.595 --> 03:15:41.930
IMAGINE THAT FIRST OF ALL OVER

03:15:41.996 --> 03:15:43.731
TIME THERE MAY BE SOME

03:15:43.798 --> 03:15:46.568
EVOLUTION OF THE TOOL- AND ALSO

03:15:46.634 --> 03:15:49.070
US- I THINK THAT. IN TERMS OF

03:15:49.137 --> 03:15:51.639
CONTINUOUS EVALUATION OF THE

03:15:51.706 --> 03:15:53.808
HOW AFFECTED THE TOOL IS AND I

03:15:53.875 --> 03:15:54.909
APPRECIATE TRYING TO MINIMIZE

03:15:54.976 --> 03:15:57.479
THE BURDEN ON HERE INSPECTING-

03:15:57.545 --> 03:15:59.714
THAT IT WAS THERE ANY THOUGHT

03:15:59.781 --> 03:16:03.751
OR ARE PLANNED TO. MAYBE TAKE A

03:16:03.818 --> 03:16:05.854
SAMPLE OF THE PLACES BACK TO DO

03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:08.022
MORE COPPER TO THE SECTION TWO

03:16:08.089 --> 03:16:09.190
IS A WAY TO EVALUATE THE FACT

03:16:09.257 --> 03:16:10.959
THIS IS A TOOL ARE TOP. IS THAT

03:16:11.025 --> 03:16:13.294
INITIAL THE MAIN QUESTION IN

03:16:13.361 --> 03:16:15.797
BEING SURE THAT IT. ACTUALLY OR

03:16:15.864 --> 03:16:20.702
FLEX- A BROADER SAID ISSUES

03:16:20.768 --> 03:16:23.538
RIGHT SO. THE PAGEANT. WELL

03:16:23.605 --> 03:16:24.272
FULLER INSPECTION A SUB HER

03:16:24.339 --> 03:16:25.206
EIGHT A SAMPLE AND YOU GO AS IT

03:16:25.273 --> 03:16:26.141
HAS YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE

03:16:26.207 --> 03:16:28.810
PICKED IT UP GIVEN HEALTH WE-

03:16:28.877 --> 03:16:30.879
BUT USING THE TOOL AS IT IS WE

03:16:30.945 --> 03:16:31.513
HAVE PICKED UP THE THINGS THAT

03:16:31.579 --> 03:16:32.647
NOW WE PICKED UP BECAUSE WE DID

03:16:32.714 --> 03:16:35.483
THIS FULLER INSPECTION- NOT

03:16:35.550 --> 03:16:37.252
JUST ON THE ONE TWO. OBVIOUSLY

03:16:37.318 --> 03:16:38.920
HAD A PROBLEM BUT ALSO IN SOME

03:16:38.987 --> 03:16:41.156
THAT. THE INITIAL TOLD OKAY

03:16:41.222 --> 03:16:42.624
EVERYTHING'S OKAY BUT TURNS OUT

03:16:42.690 --> 03:16:43.658
WE DO FULL INSPECTION IT'S NOT

03:16:43.725 --> 03:16:45.093
SO OKAY RIGHT DID SO THAT WE

03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:46.361
HAVE A MEASURE OF HOW AFFECT.

03:16:46.427 --> 03:16:48.563
HOW ACCURATE THAT DENNIS YOU'LL

03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:50.999
I THINK IN TERMS OF JUST US IN

03:16:51.065 --> 03:16:52.667
A SERVE AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT

03:16:52.734 --> 03:16:54.269
TOOL OR YOU TAKE A SAMPLE AND

03:16:54.335 --> 03:16:55.103
YOU SAY OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT

03:16:55.170 --> 03:16:56.004
WE'RE COMING AND WE HAD TO

03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:57.505
FULLER INSPECTION. SO THAT WE

03:16:57.572 --> 03:17:00.808
CAN ACTUALLY SEE HOW HOW

03:17:00.875 --> 03:17:02.277
ACCURATE ARE TOOL ACTUALLY IS

03:17:02.343 --> 03:17:03.878
IN TERMS OF THE IN TERMS OF

03:17:03.945 --> 03:17:05.146
INVESTIGATING THAT THE MAIDS IS

03:17:05.213 --> 03:17:07.348
THAT SOMETHING THAT- THAT-

03:17:07.415 --> 03:17:08.950
DEPARTMENT SAID. IT IS LOOKING

03:17:09.017 --> 03:17:10.552
INTO A CONSIDERING. THAT AND

03:17:10.618 --> 03:17:11.753
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

03:17:11.819 --> 03:17:13.655
CONSIDERING BUT I WILL TELL YOU

03:17:13.721 --> 03:17:14.923
THAT ALL OF THE PILOTS WERE A

03:17:14.989 --> 03:17:16.224
COMPREHENSIVE TOOL THAT WE

03:17:16.291 --> 03:17:17.926
DEVELOP THE STANDARD TOOL OUT

03:17:17.992 --> 03:17:19.661
OF SO IF. IF WE HAD CERTAIN

03:17:19.727 --> 03:17:21.429
VIOLATIONS AND IN SPECIFIC

03:17:21.496 --> 03:17:23.798
AREAS IT TYPICALLY. WOULD HAVE

03:17:23.865 --> 03:17:25.800
VIOLATIONS IN ANOTHER DOMAIN

03:17:25.867 --> 03:17:29.237
AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO. PAIR

03:17:29.304 --> 03:17:30.605
THAT UP AS THEY'RE DOING THEIR

03:17:30.672 --> 03:17:31.906
INSPECTIONS IF THEY HAD A

03:17:31.973 --> 03:17:33.341
VIOLATION THIS DOMAIN THAT WE

03:17:33.408 --> 03:17:34.442
WOULD ALSO GO TO THE OTHER

03:17:34.509 --> 03:17:36.744
DOMAIN SO BUT THERE IS-

03:17:36.811 --> 03:17:38.112
CONSIDERATION FOR US TO

03:17:38.179 --> 03:17:40.348
CONTINUALLY. EVALUATE THE DATA

03:17:40.415 --> 03:17:42.717
TO SEE IF. THOSE FACILITIES

03:17:42.784 --> 03:17:44.285
THAT WE'VE DONE TO SPOT CHECK

03:17:44.352 --> 03:17:46.554
INTO COMPREHENSIVE. OKAY I MEAN

03:17:46.621 --> 03:17:47.522
BECAUSE THERE IS CERTAINLY NO

03:17:47.589 --> 03:17:49.624
YOU'VE COLLECTED THAT DATA FOR

03:17:49.691 --> 03:17:50.858
ESTABLISHING THE TOOL ITSELF

03:17:50.925 --> 03:17:53.161
SIGNED AND DATED DOES EXIST I'M

03:17:53.228 --> 03:17:54.262
JUST SIR THANK YOUNG ONGOING

03:17:54.329 --> 03:17:57.098
BASIS. AND TERMS OF. COULD USE

03:17:57.165 --> 03:17:58.132
A VALUATION KNOWING THAT THE

03:17:58.199 --> 03:18:00.134
TOOL ITSELF ALSO PERHAPS OF ALL

03:18:00.201 --> 03:18:02.203
RIGHT AS WE LEARN MORE. AS

03:18:02.270 --> 03:18:04.872
WELL. THAT IS THE PLAN OKAY ALL

03:18:04.939 --> 03:18:12.447
RIGHT. OKAY SO. AND I THINK

03:18:12.513 --> 03:18:14.949
THAT'S ABOUT IT OKAY WELL AND

03:18:15.016 --> 03:18:16.851
IT SAYS THAT- ALWAYS

03:18:16.918 --> 03:18:17.719
INTERESTING HEARING FROM PEOPLE

03:18:17.785 --> 03:18:18.953
ABOUT THEIR FEEDBACK BUT GLAD

03:18:19.020 --> 03:18:20.955

THIS THE SOULS WORKING OUT

03:18:23.625 --> 03:18:25.326
PRETTY WELL RIGHT WELL SO FAR I

03:18:25.393 --> 03:18:26.995
MEAN THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH

03:18:27.061 --> 03:18:28.463
THE LENGTH OF HOW LONG IT TAKES

03:18:28.529 --> 03:18:30.365
BECAUSE IT'S EXTENDED THE TIME

03:18:30.431 --> 03:18:31.432
FOR THE TOOL BUT FOR THE MOST

03:18:31.499 --> 03:18:33.101
PART THERE PLEASE BECAUSE

03:18:33.167 --> 03:18:34.669
THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO GO

03:18:34.736 --> 03:18:36.004
OVER THE REGULATIONS AND

03:18:36.070 --> 03:18:37.872
PROVIDE MORE ASSISTANCE. SO WE

03:18:37.939 --> 03:18:39.507
SURVEYED ALL OF THE LICENSEES

03:18:39.574 --> 03:18:41.109
AND DURING THE PILOT SO WE

03:18:41.175 --> 03:18:42.810
COULD GET THEIR FEEDBACK AS

03:18:42.877 --> 03:18:44.379
WELL AS WELL AS OUR L. P. A.'S

03:18:44.445 --> 03:18:46.347
AND UTILIZE THAT TO MODIFY THE

03:18:46.414 --> 03:18:49.651
TOOL OKAY. ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT.

03:18:49.717 --> 03:18:51.786
OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE

03:18:51.853 --> 03:18:53.421
NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS- ON THE

03:18:53.488 --> 03:18:54.889
ADULT RECREATIONAL RESIDENTIAL

03:18:54.956 --> 03:18:56.858
FACILITIES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE

03:18:56.924 --> 03:18:59.327
FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY.

03:18:59.394 --> 03:19:02.130
OKAY IN THE FIRST QUESTION HOW

03:19:02.196 --> 03:19:03.765
WITH THE DEPARTMENT GO ABOUT

03:19:03.831 --> 03:19:05.533
FIGURING OUT HOW MANY SSI SS

03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:06.768
HE RESIDENTS RESIDE IN THESE

03:19:06.834 --> 03:19:09.537
FACILITIES- WE'VE BEEN WE'VE

03:19:09.604 --> 03:19:10.938
BEEN STRUGGLING WITHOUT WE ARE

03:19:11.005 --> 03:19:12.840
NOW WE NOW COLLECT INFORMATION

03:19:12.907 --> 03:19:13.708
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

03:19:13.775 --> 03:19:15.209
CARE SERVICES WHICH WE MATCH

03:19:15.276 --> 03:19:16.244
WITH OUR ADDRESSES OF OUR

03:19:16.311 --> 03:19:18.379
LICENSE FACILITIES. BUT IT

03:19:18.446 --> 03:19:19.380
DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU A

03:19:19.447 --> 03:19:21.015
COMPLETE PICTURE BECAUSE A LOT

03:19:21.082 --> 03:19:23.551
OF THE TAX ARE DELIVERED TO

03:19:23.618 --> 03:19:25.920
FAMILIES OR- SOME PEOPLE DON'T

03:19:25.987 --> 03:19:27.655
EVEN CHANGE THEIR THEIR ADDRESS

03:19:27.722 --> 03:19:30.558
AND WHEN THEY THEY MOVE SO. WE

03:19:30.625 --> 03:19:32.493
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY MORE IN THE

03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:34.329
CURRENT PROCESS OF DEVELOPING

03:19:34.395 --> 03:19:37.198
A- OUTWARD FACING PORTAL IN OUR

03:19:37.265 --> 03:19:38.199
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK

03:19:38.266 --> 03:19:40.868
PROGRAM. AND IT'S ALLOWING THE

03:19:40.935 --> 03:19:45.373
PROVIDERS TO ACTUALLY- BE ABLE

03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:50.678
TO. A POINT THAT THEY HAVE TO

03:19:50.745 --> 03:19:52.647
IDENTIFY WHERE THEIR STAFF ARE

03:19:52.714 --> 03:19:54.349
GOING AND SO THEY CAN

03:19:54.415 --> 03:19:56.150
ASSOCIATION DISASSOCIATE

03:19:56.217 --> 03:19:57.518
THROUGH THIS PORTAL SO WORK IN

03:19:57.585 --> 03:19:59.654
A FOR CONSIDERING USING THAT

03:19:59.721 --> 03:20:01.389
UTILIZING THAT PORTAL TO

03:20:01.456 --> 03:20:03.458
ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO

03:20:03.524 --> 03:20:05.927
ACTUALLY- ENTER INFORMATION AND

03:20:05.993 --> 03:20:07.862
WHETHER THEY HAVE SSI CLIENTS

03:20:07.929 --> 03:20:08.796
WILL HAVE A TRUE COUNT

03:20:08.863 --> 03:20:10.732
ACCOUNTING OF THAT AND ALSO

03:20:10.798 --> 03:20:12.266
OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS HOW MANY

03:20:12.333 --> 03:20:13.901
DEMENTIA RESIDENTS ARE CARING

03:20:13.968 --> 03:20:16.404
FOR MENTAL HEALTH OR-

03:20:16.471 --> 03:20:17.839
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO THERE AND

03:20:17.905 --> 03:20:19.907
THERE'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:20:19.974 --> 03:20:22.744
US TO- EXPLORE THAT OPTION WE

03:20:22.810 --> 03:20:24.112
EXPECT THAT PORTAL TO BE

03:20:24.178 --> 03:20:29.784
COMPLETED BY- THIS FALL. WE

03:20:29.851 --> 03:20:31.386
WOULD WE WOULD NEED LEGISLATION

03:20:31.452 --> 03:20:34.255
THOUGH TO. MANDATE THIS FOR THE

03:20:34.322 --> 03:20:38.493
REPORTING OF ALL FACILITIES.

03:20:38.559 --> 03:20:40.027
AND WE LOOK AT IT IT'S A

03:20:40.094 --> 03:20:42.163
PROPOSAL FOR TRAILER BILL

03:20:42.230 --> 03:20:44.298
LANGUAGE IN THAT REGARDS- MORE

03:20:44.365 --> 03:20:45.767
FOR FIRST LOOKING AT WERE

03:20:45.833 --> 03:20:46.868
TALKING WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO

03:20:46.934 --> 03:20:47.635
SEE IF THIS IS EVEN A

03:20:47.702 --> 03:20:49.637
POSSIBILITY WE THINK AND IT'S

03:20:49.704 --> 03:20:51.506
LOOKING PROMISING BUT YOU KNOW

03:20:51.572 --> 03:20:53.007
ONCE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION

03:20:53.074 --> 03:20:56.077
THEN WE'RE GONNA. WILL LOOK AT

03:20:56.144 --> 03:21:00.114
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. GEN THE

03:21:00.181 --> 03:21:01.916
ADMINISTRATION TIMES ARE JUST

03:21:01.983 --> 03:21:03.317
RESPOND FINDS THAT WE DON'T

03:21:03.384 --> 03:21:04.318
HAVE A PROPOSAL OR TRAILER

03:21:04.385 --> 03:21:05.953
BECAUSE OF RIGHT NOW RELATED TO

03:21:06.020 --> 03:21:08.055
THAT CASE. AT THIS TIME OKAY

03:21:08.122 --> 03:21:09.357
ALL RIGHT BUT I GUESS THAT

03:21:09.424 --> 03:21:10.958
SOMEWHERE POTENTIALLY

03:21:11.025 --> 03:21:13.461
INVESTIGATING THIS OKAY. AND

03:21:13.528 --> 03:21:15.863
THEN THE SECOND QUESTION HOW

03:21:15.930 --> 03:21:17.198
MANY OF THESE FACILITIES OF

03:21:17.265 --> 03:21:19.133
CLOSED IN RECENT YEARS WHAT

03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:21.102
AFFECTS HAVE THOSE CLOSEST HAD

03:21:21.169 --> 03:21:24.071
ON CAPACITY OVER THE LAST THREE

03:21:24.138 --> 03:21:26.274
YEARS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE

03:21:26.340 --> 03:21:28.276
HUNDRED FACILITIES HAVE CLOSED-

03:21:28.342 --> 03:21:30.711
AND WE'VE LICENSE APPROXIMATELY

03:21:30.778 --> 03:21:32.480
TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. IT'S SO THE

03:21:32.547 --> 03:21:34.749
CAPACITY INCREASED BY FOUR

03:21:34.816 --> 03:21:37.585
POINT 8% AND FROM THE DATA THAT

03:21:37.652 --> 03:21:40.188
WE HAVE ON SSI IT LOOKS LIKE

03:21:40.254 --> 03:21:42.857
THE SSI CAPACITY DECREASED BY

03:21:42.924 --> 03:21:49.363
TWO POINT 6% OKAY. IN THE ANY

03:21:58.005 --> 03:21:59.373
FACILITIES THAT CLOSED IN THE

JUST THE GENERALLY HIGH

03:22:10.585 --> 03:22:12.653
OPERATING COSTS WERE WERE

03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:14.856
FACTORS TO WEAR THE SAME. THEY

03:22:14.922 --> 03:22:16.424
CLOSED BUT IT'S ABOUT WASN'T

03:22:16.491 --> 03:22:17.792
ALL OF THEM THERE WERE SOME FOR

03:22:17.859 --> 03:22:21.062
NON COMPLIANCE. BUT DEFINITELY

03:22:21.128 --> 03:22:21.863
THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES

03:22:21.929 --> 03:22:24.866
WERE- WERE MENTIONED OKAY.

03:22:24.932 --> 03:22:28.035

IT RE RE EMPHASIZE THAT AGAIN

03:22:36.544 --> 03:22:38.679
AND THAT'S AGAIN WHY- ONE OF

03:22:38.746 --> 03:22:41.582
THE USES OF THE PROPOSED SEVEN

03:22:41.649 --> 03:22:42.183

TYPE SO WE ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE

03:22:46.954 --> 03:22:48.289
THAT CHALLENGE IN THAT IS PART

03:22:48.356 --> 03:22:50.224
OF THE SOLUTION THAT WE'RE

03:22:50.291 --> 03:22:51.893

03:23:31.065 --> 03:23:32.867
DECIDED AT A MORE LOCAL LEVEL

03:23:32.934 --> 03:23:34.669

WE CAN THROW INTO THE COURT

03:24:56.417 --> 03:24:56.984
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BUT

03:24:57.051 --> 03:24:58.719
IT TURNS OUT WE HAVE. BY THE

03:24:58.786 --> 03:24:59.787

HAVE TO HAVE A WHOLE NOTHER

03:25:07.695 --> 03:25:09.263
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT SO I'M

OFFICE. I THINK IT'S A GOOD

03:25:32.787 --> 03:25:33.254
QUESTION I THINK IT REALLY

03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:34.655
COMES DOWN TO HOW YOU WANT TO

03:25:34.722 --> 03:25:35.856
APPROACH IT TOO AND I THINK THE

OF THE RATE AND HOW TO

03:25:48.903 --> 03:25:49.970
STABILIZE IT VIA SORT OF SOME

03:25:50.037 --> 03:25:51.839
SORT OF SUBSIDY. SUBSIDIZATION

03:25:51.906 --> 03:25:54.375
OF THE RATE. SETTING THOSE ARE.

03:25:54.442 --> 03:25:55.476
THE STRIKING A BALANCE THERE

03:25:55.543 --> 03:25:57.044
SORT OF IS THAT. PART OF THE

03:25:57.111 --> 03:25:58.846
QUESTION IF IT'S MORE A AND

03:25:58.913 --> 03:26:01.449
THOSE ALSO- INVOLVE MAKING

03:26:01.515 --> 03:26:03.017
DECISIONS ABOUT ONE TIME VERSES

03:26:03.084 --> 03:26:05.352
ONGOING COSTS AS WELL SO. WE'D

03:26:11.792 --> 03:26:13.494
BUT- THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. KEY

03:26:13.561 --> 03:26:14.495
QUESTIONS I THINK TO ADDRESS

03:26:14.562 --> 03:26:15.963
FIRST. BUT I THINK IT WOULD

03:26:16.030 --> 03:26:16.931
ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE GETTING

03:26:16.997 --> 03:26:18.432
CLOSER TO ACTUALLY TALKING

03:26:18.499 --> 03:26:20.267

FIFTY MILLION ADDING WE HAVE TO

03:26:21.635 --> 03:26:23.771

SAY OH IT'S GOING TO BE

03:26:27.875 --> 03:26:29.577
ADDRESSED BY THAT. PART OF

03:26:29.643 --> 03:26:30.945
MONEY IT'S UNDER FIFTY MILLION

03:26:31.011 --> 03:26:32.680
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND-

03:26:32.747 --> 03:26:33.380
SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT BE AN

03:26:33.447 --> 03:26:35.149
EXACT NUMBER MAY BE YOU KNOW A

03:26:35.216 --> 03:26:36.851
BIT OF A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

03:26:36.917 --> 03:26:38.219
AND- AND- YOU KNOW HOW THE

03:26:38.285 --> 03:26:39.587
ACTUAL DECISIONS BE MADE JUST

03:26:39.653 --> 03:26:40.621

THE REGIONAL MINISTERS DECIDING

03:26:43.324 --> 03:26:44.658
ON THE LOCAL LEVEL WHETHER TO

03:26:44.725 --> 03:26:45.860
GO TO SPEND THE MONEY ON THAT.

03:26:45.926 --> 03:26:47.828
GOT EIGHT HEARD THAT WE WILL

03:26:47.895 --> 03:26:48.429
HAVE A WHOLE NOTHER DISCUSSION

03:26:48.496 --> 03:26:51.398
WHEN I GOT LIVE. TO DISCUSS THE

03:26:51.465 --> 03:26:52.533
PRESENT BECAUSE OF VARIOUS WAYS

03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:53.901
OF MAKING DECISIONS HERE RIGHT

NOW THAT'S FOR THE FUTURE

03:26:55.002 --> 03:26:56.771

STABILIZATION. THROUGH THAT

03:27:04.779 --> 03:27:06.547
OTHER PART OF MONEY. I THINK

03:27:06.614 --> 03:27:07.882
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GETA SENSE

03:27:07.948 --> 03:27:10.918
OF SCALE OF OKAY. FINE THEN. IF

03:27:10.985 --> 03:27:12.052

WITH THE SWORD THE BOUNDARIES

03:27:29.837 --> 03:27:31.405
OF THAT AND I WAS. IN THE

03:27:31.472 --> 03:27:32.840
DECISIONS MAY BE MADE EXACTLY.

03:27:32.907 --> 03:27:34.074
WHERE WE ARE IN THAT RANGE THE

03:27:34.141 --> 03:27:36.343
WHAT IS SORT OF THE- RANGE OF

PEOPLE FROM BEING THROWN OUT OF

03:27:46.220 --> 03:27:47.788
THEIR HOUSES ETCETERA FOR THIS.

03:27:47.855 --> 03:27:49.723
PARTICULAR POPULATION IN THIS

03:27:49.790 --> 03:27:51.158
GROUP SO THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING

03:27:51.225 --> 03:27:53.594
TO. GET MY ARMS AROUND

03:27:53.661 --> 03:27:54.662
UNDERSTOOD IN TE IN IN JUST TO

03:27:54.728 --> 03:27:56.063
THE- TO THE QUESTIONS THAT

03:27:56.130 --> 03:27:57.231
WE'VE HEARD EARLIER RELATED TO

03:27:57.298 --> 03:27:59.033
PROJECTIONS I THINK THAT. THE

03:27:59.099 --> 03:28:01.435
COMPLICATING FACTOR IN COMING

03:28:01.502 --> 03:28:02.236
UP WITH THOSE PROJECTIONS IS

03:28:02.303 --> 03:28:03.704
THAT THIS SECOND. I'M AND WE

03:28:03.771 --> 03:28:07.208
CAN'T QUITE PREDICT. WHO'S

03:28:07.274 --> 03:28:08.976
GOING TO SELECT IDENTIFY WHICH

03:28:09.043 --> 03:28:10.611
CARE SAID. AND WHAT'S MORE. THE

03:28:10.678 --> 03:28:14.682
MOST APPROPRIATE. IT'S BEING

03:28:14.748 --> 03:28:16.250
ABLE TO STAY WITHIN THEIR AND

03:28:16.317 --> 03:28:17.284
THEIR- MATCH. PROVIDER CAN.

03:28:17.351 --> 03:28:19.119
WHETHER IT THIS AT. THE IS PART

03:28:19.186 --> 03:28:20.321
OF THIS SINCE I THINK THAT'S

03:28:20.387 --> 03:28:22.256
BEEN. THE MOST CALM. FACTOR

03:28:22.323 --> 03:28:23.424
WHEN WE THINKING A- WHICH- IS.

03:28:23.490 --> 03:28:26.427
WHAT BE THE- AT PLACE. IN

03:28:26.493 --> 03:28:27.862
SETTING FOR ANY GIVEN AND-

03:28:27.928 --> 03:28:29.864
JEWEL. OKAY I MEAN I GET THAT.

03:28:29.930 --> 03:28:30.798
DOWN THERE THERE MAY BE

03:28:30.865 --> 03:28:32.166
ALTERNATIVE SO THEY WON'T MISS

03:28:32.233 --> 03:28:36.303
A STAY IN THIS BUT AT LEAST.

03:28:36.370 --> 03:28:38.505
FOR THIS. ANY AND- THIS IS. IN

03:28:38.572 --> 03:28:39.807
TERMS OF THE OF THIS SUMMER SO

03:28:39.874 --> 03:28:40.674
IS THAT OKAY GIVEN THE CAR

03:28:40.741 --> 03:28:41.508
POPULATION THAT THERE IN THE

03:28:41.575 --> 03:28:43.844
SITUATION ASSUMING THEY MAY

03:28:43.911 --> 03:28:45.279
MOVE TO SOMETHING ELSE AND THEY

03:28:45.346 --> 03:28:46.614
WORK OUT BETTER OR SOMETHING

03:28:46.680 --> 03:28:47.882
BUT JUST EVEN THE CURRENT

03:28:47.948 --> 03:28:49.884
POPULATION ASSUMING THE STATE'S

03:28:49.950 --> 03:28:51.952
BUT HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD WE

03:28:52.019 --> 03:28:53.387
NEED FOR THEM TO QUOTE STATE

03:28:53.454 --> 03:28:55.189
BUT NOW WE MAY PROVIDE A BETTER

03:28:55.256 --> 03:28:56.257
ALTERNATIVE AND THEY WON'T SAY

03:28:56.323 --> 03:28:57.191
BUT WE DON'T NEED THAT MUCH

03:28:57.258 --> 03:28:58.559
MONEY IT'S AT- BUT I DID GET

03:28:58.626 --> 03:29:00.761

03:29:00.828 --> 03:29:03.163
GET A HANDLE OF. ON THE END WE

03:29:03.230 --> 03:29:04.899
HAVE TO DECIDE IS YEAH WE- IS

03:29:04.965 --> 03:29:06.200
THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

03:29:06.267 --> 03:29:07.401

THAT NUMBER BASED ON VARIOUS

03:29:14.775 --> 03:29:16.644
FACTORS IT CETERA. BUT I THINK

03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:18.746
THIS IS A SORT OF A CHECK ON.

03:29:18.812 --> 03:29:20.447
IS A HUNDRED TO BE IT. WE NEED

03:29:20.514 --> 03:29:22.283

MORE THAN LAST BUT YOU KNOW

03:29:23.918 --> 03:29:26.587
THAT SO JUST AS WELL AS EVERY

03:29:26.654 --> 03:29:27.054
EVERY TIME WE HAVE A

03:29:27.121 --> 03:29:28.923

POT. OF REALLY ADDRESS IT THAT

03:29:34.595 --> 03:29:37.064
WAY. SO IF THERE'S A WAY TO GET

BACK WITH SOME SORT OF.

03:29:39.166 --> 03:29:41.035
ESTIMATE RANGE OR SOMETHING ON

03:29:41.101 --> 03:29:42.303
THAT SCALE THAT WOULD BE

03:29:42.369 --> 03:29:44.538
HELPFUL- JUST SO THAT WE GET A

03:29:44.605 --> 03:29:47.107
SENSE OF HOW THIS IS ALL

03:29:47.174 --> 03:29:47.708
STARTING TO ADD UP. IN THE END

03:29:47.775 --> 03:29:49.476
SO. YES I KNOW YOU HAVE TO MAKE

LIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:31:25.873 --> 03:31:26.974
HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS THERE'S

03:31:27.041 --> 03:31:28.142

LICENSE NOT RESIDENTIAL

03:31:32.246 --> 03:31:33.414
FACILITIES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE

FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. WE

03:31:35.649 --> 03:31:36.517
WERE JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE

03:31:36.583 --> 03:31:37.918
ARE SOME DATA LIMITATIONS WHICH

03:31:37.985 --> 03:31:39.753
REALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO

03:31:39.820 --> 03:31:41.255
FULLY UNDERSTAND WHO THESE

03:31:41.321 --> 03:31:42.790
FACILITIES SERVE AND THE

03:31:42.856 --> 03:31:43.590
SEVERITY OF THE CLOSURE

03:31:43.657 --> 03:31:45.726
PROBLEM- SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE

03:31:45.793 --> 03:31:48.262
HAVE OUR- AS AS WAS MENTIONED

03:31:48.328 --> 03:31:49.530
IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE HOW

03:31:49.596 --> 03:31:51.365
MANY AS A SIZE AS P. RESIDENTS

03:31:51.432 --> 03:31:52.232
ARE IN THESE FACILITIES BUT

03:31:52.299 --> 03:31:54.034
ALSO RESIDENTS YOU MAY RECEIVE

OTHER TYPES PUBLIC ASSISTANCE

03:31:55.803 --> 03:31:57.604
AND- HOW HAVE CLOSURES IMPACTED

03:31:57.671 --> 03:31:58.806
THESE LOWER INCOME MORE

03:31:58.872 --> 03:32:00.741
VULNERABLE RESIDENTS IN

03:32:00.808 --> 03:32:01.575
PARTICULAR. AND THEN FINALLY

03:32:01.642 --> 03:32:03.177
WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS

03:32:03.243 --> 03:32:05.813
THESE FACILITIES AT ALL- EITHER

03:32:05.879 --> 03:32:08.215
TO COST OR TO LACK OF SUPPLY A

03:32:08.282 --> 03:32:10.417
MORE FOR SOME OTHER REASON SO-

03:32:10.484 --> 03:32:12.252
WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH

03:32:12.319 --> 03:32:12.820
THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE

03:32:12.886 --> 03:32:15.155
ADMINISTRATION TO BETTER

03:32:15.222 --> 03:32:16.957
UNDERSTAND THESE QUESTIONS. SHE

03:32:17.024 --> 03:32:21.161
THE- IN THE COMMENTS OKAY ALL

03:32:21.228 --> 03:32:23.897
RIGHT WELL- YOU KNOW EXCEPT THE

03:32:23.964 --> 03:32:27.401
IT'S- FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE

03:32:27.468 --> 03:32:29.536
DATA TOGETHER AND KNOW THAT- TO

03:32:29.603 --> 03:32:30.304
CERTAIN DEGREE IT'S CHALLENGING

03:32:30.370 --> 03:32:32.439
RIGHT YOU KNOW ITS- THEN WE

03:32:32.506 --> 03:32:34.775
ALSO PEOPLE DON'T LOS NOW WE

03:32:34.842 --> 03:32:35.876
WILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

03:32:35.943 --> 03:32:37.478
AND NOW YES RESIDENTIAL

03:32:37.544 --> 03:32:38.879
FACILITIES WHO ARE NOW ASK

03:32:38.946 --> 03:32:40.214
QUESTIONS OF PEOPLE MAY NOT

03:32:40.280 --> 03:32:41.081
NECESSARILY WANT TO ANSWER ALL

03:32:41.148 --> 03:32:43.117
OF THEM BECAUSE IT CETERA BUT I

03:32:43.183 --> 03:32:44.551
MEAN I THINK WE NEED TO TRY TO

03:32:44.618 --> 03:32:45.352
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET A BETTER

03:32:45.419 --> 03:32:48.155
HANDLE ON. ON THIS AND- NOW

03:32:48.222 --> 03:32:50.290
WITH WITH THE GUILT DOLE. BUT

03:32:50.357 --> 03:32:52.759
CHALLENGED BY- NESSA'S IRATE

03:32:52.826 --> 03:32:55.062
THAT DOESN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO

03:32:55.129 --> 03:32:57.197
PAY IT NOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF

03:32:57.264 --> 03:32:58.632
MONEY THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR

03:32:58.699 --> 03:33:00.667
FACILITIES IS- AND THAT'S WHAT

03:33:00.734 --> 03:33:01.735
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD ABOUT THE

03:33:01.802 --> 03:33:03.103
DECREASING NUMBER AT THE

03:33:03.170 --> 03:33:04.605
REIMBURSEMENT RATE THAT'S THE

03:33:04.671 --> 03:33:05.973
PAYMENT RATES PEOPLE CAN'T DATE

03:33:06.039 --> 03:33:06.974
THEY HAVE A CEILING WHAT THEY

03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:08.842
COULD AFFORD TO PAY AND THAT'S

03:33:08.909 --> 03:33:09.376
NOT ENOUGH FRIGHTENED SO

03:33:09.443 --> 03:33:10.944
THAT'S- GREEN CHALLENGES FOR

03:33:11.011 --> 03:33:12.346
OPERATORS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T.

03:33:12.412 --> 03:33:13.380
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO

03:33:13.447 --> 03:33:15.916
OPERATE EIGHT AND THEN- AND

03:33:15.983 --> 03:33:17.885
THEN SO WHAT CAN WE TRY TO DO

03:33:17.951 --> 03:33:20.220
TO DO THAT HOW DO YOU DO THAT

03:33:20.287 --> 03:33:21.421
YOU KNOW MORE TARGETED TYPE

03:33:21.488 --> 03:33:22.656
THING WORDS I THINK WE'LL TALK

03:33:22.723 --> 03:33:23.624
ABOUT SOME FIFTY MILLION WITH

03:33:23.690 --> 03:33:25.559
ONLY GET TO THAT. AND ALSO JUST

03:33:25.626 --> 03:33:26.760
THE YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT THE WHAT

03:33:26.827 --> 03:33:29.096
WAS THE SCOPE- TRYING TO FIGURE

03:33:29.163 --> 03:33:33.433
OUT HOW TO DEFINE THE SCOPE OF

03:33:33.500 --> 03:33:34.034
THE- OF THE OF THE PROBLEM. IN

03:33:34.101 --> 03:33:35.469
ADDITION. TO DOING NAY. TO AT

03:33:35.536 --> 03:33:36.803
LEAST GET ENOUGH THAT. PICTURE

03:33:36.870 --> 03:33:38.906
SO WE KNOW WHAT. KIND OF SCALE

03:33:38.972 --> 03:33:40.574
OF INTERVENTION WE NEED TO. TO

03:33:40.641 --> 03:33:43.043
ENGAGE IN. SO APPRECIATE THAT

03:33:43.110 --> 03:33:44.478
SO I LOOK FOR TO OUR ONGOING

03:33:44.545 --> 03:33:45.779
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS I'M

03:33:45.846 --> 03:33:47.614
SURE THIS WILL COME BACK UP

03:33:47.681 --> 03:33:49.216
AGAIN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE

03:33:49.283 --> 03:33:52.085
LARGER POT LATER ON SO. THANK

03:33:52.152 --> 03:33:53.987

03:33:55.889 --> 03:33:57.191
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF

03:33:57.257 --> 03:33:58.759
ALL THE MEDICAL CARE ISSUES

03:33:58.825 --> 03:33:59.693
THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THESE

03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:00.928
FACILITIES THAT THEY'RE JUST

03:34:00.994 --> 03:34:02.062
THEY'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO

03:34:02.129 --> 03:34:02.529
UNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT

03:34:02.596 --> 03:34:04.264
CLINICIANS AND SO WE'VE REALLY

03:34:04.331 --> 03:34:05.432
FOCUSED ON THAT AND HOPE TO

03:34:05.499 --> 03:34:06.700
ATTEMPTED. TO REDUCE THESE

03:34:06.767 --> 03:34:09.803
CLOSURES. ARMS SO YOU KNOW

ACCEPT THE SS I SS P. THAT'S

03:42:25.799 --> 03:42:27.467
NOT AN OPTION IF A PERSON IS

03:42:27.534 --> 03:42:28.468
LIVING IN A FACILITY AND

03:42:28.535 --> 03:42:30.537
BECOMES ELIGIBLE. THEY GET TO

03:42:30.603 --> 03:42:32.539
STAY IT'S NOT ABOUT THE

03:42:32.605 --> 03:42:34.207

03:42:34.274 --> 03:42:35.542
