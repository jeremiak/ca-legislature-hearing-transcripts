00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:54.751
MOVING ON LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:57.187
SECTION OF SECTION ONE IT'S ALL

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:58.021
ABOUT WHEN AND WHY

IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH

ANOTHER ENTITY AND SO THE

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:07.831
CHANGES IN SUBDIVISION AL TO THE

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.200
DEFINITION OF TRANSPORTATION

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:14.771
AGENCY TO INCLUDE ANY CONTRACTOR.

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:17.741
ISN'T A HUGE LOOPHOLE.

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.176
BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW A TOLL

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:21.478
COLLECTION AGENCY TO GET AROUND

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:22.913

ENTIRE INTENT OF THE STATUTE.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.455
FOR THESE REASONS WE THINK THAT

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:33.757
THE SPELL THE POLICY MOVING

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:37.227
FORWARD -- IN ADDITION TO ALL OF

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:40.263
THE CONCERNS AROUND THE ODD.

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.732
RETROACTIVITY AND THE DUE

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:43.967
PROCESS AND PUBLICATIONS WE

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:45.602
THINK THIS IS BAD POLICY FOR

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.070
CALIFORNIA DRIVERS AND WE

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:49.039

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.144
THE MEMBERS MY NAME'S BLAKE WHEN

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:55.745
THE MEN I REPRESENT A CERTIFIED

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:59.483
CLASS OF DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA --

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:01.051
WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:03.353
GO -- TO SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.754
HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:05.889
ISSUES WITH THIS BILL ARE

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.224
HARMFUL.

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.859
FIRST AND FOREMOST A SUBSECTION

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:11.328
T. WHICH DEALS WITH THE FACT

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:12.963
THAT THIS WOULD BE DECLARATORY

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:14.431
OF EXISTING LAW.

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:15.765
THE AMENDMENTS TO THAT MY

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:17.801
COLLEAGUE JUST DISCUSS GO FAR

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:18.902
AND BEYOND A WATER DECLARE

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.204
TOWARD EXISTING LAW AND AND HAVE

00:52:21.271 --> 00:52:23.173
THE REAL ABILITY TO IMPERIL THE

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:27.043
PRIVACY RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.312
SECOND -- I BROUGHT THIS CASE --

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:30.380
OF THE FIRST ATTORNEY TO BRING A

00:52:30.447 --> 00:52:31.915
CASE OR THIRTY ONE FOR NINETY

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.483
BECAUSE I'D AN EIGHTY SIX YEAR

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.851
OLD HOMELESS VETERAN CLIENT.

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.786
WHO HAD NO REDRESS HIS PERSONAL

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:38.121
AND IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WAS

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.856
TRANSMITTED TO THE DMV

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:42.792
IMPROPERLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:44.127
IMPOSING A WHOLE?

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:45.595
UNDER THIS STATUTE SEVERAL

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:47.664
CALIFORNIANS ARE IN JEOPARDY

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.933
BECAUSE THEIR CARS CAN BE TAKEN

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.102
BY THE USE OF THEIR P. I UNDER

00:52:52.168 --> 00:52:54.037
THE AMENDMENTS -- MISTER CHAIR I

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:56.573
RESPECTFULLY LOOK AT SECTION I

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.208
AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.709
PROVISION AND LEADS A LARGE

00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:01.811
LOOPHOLE THAT ANY OPERATION OR

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:02.979
MANAGEMENT.

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:05.048
CAN INCLUDE SENDING P. I. FOR

00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:06.483
ANY PURPOSE.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:07.851
SO WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT I

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:09.553
IN MAKE SURE THAT'S ADDRESSED

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:12.088
REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT TI AND

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:13.857
MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ADDRESSED --

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:17.127
SECOND A TO ADDRESS SECTION FOUR

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:17.994
OH TWO FIVE FOUR OF THE

00:53:18.061 --> 00:53:19.563
CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE.

00:53:19.629 --> 00:53:22.966
THE REAL CONCERN HERE IS THAT --

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.601
THEY THE TOLL ENTITIES WANT TO

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.202
SEND INFORMATION TO A RELIABLE

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:27.437
PARTY.

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:29.439
BUT THAT BEGS THE QUESTION AS TO

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.508
WHO THAT PARTY WILL BE AND WHAT

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:33.009
THE DATA WILL BE USED FOR

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:34.644
SENATORS TO MILLIONS BILL I HAVE

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.246
THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY WAS NOT

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:37.347
JUST ABOUT MARKETING.

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:38.548
IT WAS ABOUT THE USE OF TRAVEL

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.450
PATTERN DATA IN HERE THERE'S A

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:43.253
REAL CONCERN THAT DRIVERS

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.889
INFORMATION IS BEING -- IMPROPER

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:47.724
CREDIT IN CORY'S -- THROUGH

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.893

THERE ARE CHANGES TO CURRENT LAW

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:41.711
THAT SHOULD NOT BE APPROVED BY

THIS COMMITTEE -- THEY INCLUDE

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:45.882

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:01.998
AMENDED ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:03.800
THAT WAS IN THE POSSESSION OF

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:06.102
THE AGENCY TRANSPORTATION AGENCY.

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:08.571
BEFORE JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY

00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:11.508

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:18.114
THAT WILL CERTAINLY IMPACT OF

00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:19.616
CURRENT LITIGATION IN A VERY

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:20.750
NEGATIVE WAY.

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:24.054
AND WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED WITH

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:31.861
IRTY ONE FOR NINETY THAT

00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:32.929
ELIMINATES RESTRICTION ON OF THE

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:33.763
SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.732
THIRD PARTIES BECAUSE IT DEFINES.

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.967
WHICH ARE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY

00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:39.803
AND ANY CONTRACTOR FOR ANY

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:42.605
SUBCONTRACTOR AT ANY LEVEL AS

TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. FOR THE

00:55:57.253 --> 00:55:59.456
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL WHICH MEANS

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:00.924
THEY'RE NOT SHARING.

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:02.425
SO THAT IS A MAJOR CHANGE IN IN

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:04.794
TERMS OF CURRENT CONSUMER

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.096
PRIVACY PROTECTION.

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:08.798
AND OF THE THIRD POINT HAS TO DO

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:09.666
WITH.

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:13.970
US SECTION. THIRTY FOUR ONE FOUR

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:14.704
NINETY C..

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:16.906
VIOLATION INFORMATION IS ALREADY

00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:18.408
COVERED.

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:20.910
OF IN CURRENT LAW OF IT CAN BE

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:23.580
RETAINED UNTIL EITHER FOR YEARS

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.615

WORD TOLD THE VIOLATION HAS BEEN

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:30.053
RESOLVED BUT THIS MOVES IT TO A

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.187
DIFFERENT SECTION.

00:56:31.254 --> 00:56:33.189
SO VIOLATION INFORMATION NOW CAN

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.457
BE RETAINED INDEFINITELY AND WE

00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:35.992
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT IS

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:38.094
PROTECTIVE OF THE PRIVACY OF

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.262
CONSUMERS SO.

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.397
THOSE ARE OUR OUR MOST ARE

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:43.733

AN ACCURATE ADDRESS BY ALLOWING

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.575
ANY SOURCE TO BECOME.

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.477
A RELIABLE SOURCE THAT COULD BE

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:56.112
AN INTERNET SEARCH YOU GET AN

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:03.920

APPEAR TO TAKE THAT OUT BUT IT'S

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:07.410
HARD TO TELL BECAUSE THE

AMENDMENTS.

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.013
IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT ARE IN

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.581
THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT STATE LAW

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:12.482
NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR BILL

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:13.816

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:31.968
HARD TO TELL.

00:59:32.035 --> 00:59:33.002
THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:34.537
THINK IS STILL A PROBLEM IN THE

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:36.072

SERVING THOSE CHALLENGES THAT'S

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:08.017
NECESSARY GOT IT OKAY.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:08.885
AND THEN I AM.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:12.421
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:16.959
SECTION. FOUR ZERO TWO FIVE BE

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:19.162

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.465
FINES.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.167
SO I WAS RECENTLY DRIVING ORANGE

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:25.935
COUNTY AND NOT BEING FROM ORANGE

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:27.203
COUNTY ENDED UP ON A TOLL ROAD

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.804
WITHOUT KNOWING IT DIDN'T HAVE

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:31.073
MY FAST TRACK -- MY HUSBAND WAS

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.742
DRIVING AND I THOUGHT OH NO WELL

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:34.143
I'LL JUST GO ON THEIR WEBSITE

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.279
AND I'LL PAY THE TOLL.

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:37.280
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:38.714
THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO PAY

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.183
THE TOLL PROSPECTIVELY UNLESS I

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.651
HAD MY TOLL TAG.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:42.752
SO HERE I WAS ON A TOLL ROAD

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:43.853
WHICH DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS DOING

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.655
IT I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THEY SENT

01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:46.789

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:47.256
TO ME.

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.925
SO I WOULD AS I SEE THIS THE

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.159
BEST EFFORT WOULD INCLUDE THE

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.195
ABILITY TO PAY THE TOLL UP FRONT

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.362
TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:54.497
DO THAT SO.

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:57.200
I GUESS I JUST SEE THIS AS YOU

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.801
KNOW WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS A

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:01.304
PRETTY STRONG THING TO PROVIDE.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.239
AND TO PROVIDE IT WITHOUT MAKING

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.173
SURE THAT ALL OF OUR TOLL

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.708
PROVIDERS ARE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:08.110
PAY THESE TOLLS IS SOMETHING

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:10.646

THE PERFORMANCE OF COLLECTION

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.003
AND ETCETERA ETCETERA.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.204
IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.739
YOU'RE SHARING IN THE

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.441
PERFORMANCE OF THOSE DUTIES

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:19.575
WHICH IS A CONCERN FOR ME RIGHT

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:20.943
YOU DO YOU HAVE A LOT MORE

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.478
INFORMATION THEY NEED THEN IT

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.080
NEEDS TO BE SHARED WITH THE DMV

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.548
TO PERFORM YOUR DUTIES.

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:26.816
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:28.684
NARROWED SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:29.719
THE YOU'RE DOING IT FOR THE

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:30.853
RIGHT REASONS BUT YOU'RE ALSO

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.455
ONLY SHARING THE DATA THAT IS

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.757
NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THAT.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:35.725
BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO SHARE

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:37.126
WITH THE DMV WHAT LANE I WAS IN

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:37.693
OR WHAT BRIDGE I WAS HONORED

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.663
CETERA ETCETERA RIGHT IN ORDER

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:41.697
TO GET MY ADDRESS.

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.332
YES AND WE DEFINITELY WORK WITH

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:44.500
THE DMV AND IT HERE TO THEIR

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:46.001
STANDARDS IN TERMS OF THE FIELDS

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:47.837
AND DATA WE HAVE TO SUBMIT TO

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:48.904
WORK WITH THEIR SYSTEM.

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:50.973
BUT I I I DON'T SEE YOUR REQUEST

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.709
AS UNREASONABLE I THINK IF YEAH

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:55.144
I WANTED TO SEE MORE DEFINITION.

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:56.746
AROUND THAT I THINK LAYING OUT

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.781
THE EXACT DATA WE SHARE IN EACH

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.883
INSTANCE WOULD MAKE THE BILL

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.151
AWFUL ALL RIGHT -- BECAUSE WE

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:03.853
ARE VERY SELECTIVE AND DEPENDING

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.588
ON THE PURPOSE.

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.390
OF THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACT IN

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:09.024
THE FUNCTION WE DO LIMITED DATA

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:11.026
THATWE WOULD SHARE WITH THEM

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:11.560
JUST LIKE WE DO WITH INTER

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:12.561
OPERABILITY.

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:13.462
RIGHT BUT I THINK YOU COULD DO

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:14.597
SOMETHING LIKE SAY ONLY THE

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:17.366
INFORMATION NECESSARY TO PERFORM

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:18.200
HIS DUTIES FOR EXAMPLE

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:18.501
[inaudible]

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:21.771
I WHICH IS I WOULD JUST I WOULD

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:22.371
JUST ASK THAT YOU KNOW WE HEAR

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:23.572
IT THE REPAIR REASON WE'RE HERE

01:07:23.639 --> 01:07:24.607
IS BECAUSE OF GRAY AREA SOMEONE

01:07:24.673 --> 01:07:25.808
WE SITE SOMETHING LIGHT.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.543
AS NECESSARY IS THAT GOING TO

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.179
CREATE ANOTHER GRAY AREA WHERE.

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:32.381
ONE GROUP MAY SAY NECESSARY

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:33.883
MEANT THIS AND ANOTHER GROUP.

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.151
SAYS NO IT MEANT THIS.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.318
RIGHT WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.287
THAT WEEK THAT SOME OF THE TOLL

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:39.455
AGENCIES HAVE BEEN SHARING MORE

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.656
DATA THE NECESSARY WHICH IS WHY

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.691
I SAY THIS AND SO I THINK THAT

01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:43.959
TALKING ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE

01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:45.494
SHARED IS IMPORTANT PIECE OF

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:46.762
THIS PUZZLE.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.898
WE NOT JUST THE THE PURPOSE OF

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:23.365
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN

OF THE BILL THAT ARE STILL

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:50.599
THIS IS -- AN EXPANSION OF WHAT

01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:53.902
IS SO ALLOW UNDER EXISTING LAW.

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:56.371
NOW APPLY PROSPECTIVELY I HAVE

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:58.307
CONCERNS THAT AGENCIES WOULD NOT

BE INCENTIVIZE TO LIMIT THE

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:02.077
SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.546
OF WHAT IS NECESSARY -- TO

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:05.848
COMPLETE A TASK.

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:07.483
NO THIS COULD RESULT IN NOT A

PASSED LAST YEAR THAT THE CCPA.

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:20.462
I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT --

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.331
BUT I'M I'M EVEN MORE CONCERNED

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:24.099
ABOUT THE RETROACTIVE

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.902
APPLICATION OF THE BILL.

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.037
OUR FIRST AHA I BELIEVE THAT

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:30.606
LEGISLATION SHOULD APPLY

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.107
PROSPECTIVELY.

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:35.010
ARE TO AVOID ANY -- TO AVOID.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.012
INTERFERING WITH ANY PENDING

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.313
LITIGATION.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.315
WHEN APPLIED RETROACTIVELY I'M

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.684
CONCERNED AT THIS EXPANSION?

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.920
OF WILL ALLOW INTO THESE THAT

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.922
HAVE WILEY TO THE LONG TO OF

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:48.857
AVOID BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.459
THOSE VIOLATIONS.

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.261
AND EVEN WORSE SO WILL PREVENT

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:54.062
INJURE THE PARTIES FROM SEEKING

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:56.131
REDRESS.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:58.100
I'M I THINK -- THE PROPONENTS

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.935
HAVE ARGUED THAT MANY OF THESE

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:02.037
PLAINTIFF SUFFER NO HARM AND

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.872
AGENCIES ACT WITHIN THE SPIRIT

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.407
OF THE ORIGINAL.

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:06.708
LEGISLATION.

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:08.177
NO I THINK THAT IF IF THERE ARE

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.612
TRULY FRIVOLOUS CITATIONS BEING

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:11.580
FILED.

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:14.082
I THINK THE PROPER PLACE -- TO

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:16.385
DISCERN OR ADJUDICATE WOULD BE

01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:18.587
WOULD BE ALL IN THE COURT SYSTEM.

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:21.590
INSTEAD OF REWRITING THE LAW.

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:23.759
ARE THERE IS NOT TO SAY THAT --

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:26.094
UNLIMITED LIABILITY FOR TOLL

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:27.596
AGENCIES IS NOT A PROBLEM.

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.364
OUR MILLIONS OF TAX PAYERS

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:30.799
DOLLARS HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:32.968
THAT WHOLE ROSE AS WE HEARD.

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:36.004
ALL AND MANY OF US RELY ON THEM

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:36.305
[inaudible]

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:39.308
AND YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT --

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:42.177
ANY RETROACTIVITY ARE THAT WE

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:43.712
TAKE ON SHOULD BE LIMITED TO

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:45.681
JUST AMENDMENTS THAT TRULY

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:48.183
CLARIFY THE LAW AND DO NOT WATER

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:48.750
DOWN.

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:50.552
ANY RIGHT SO THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:51.353
HOUSE.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.688
WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONAL

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:55.090
INFORMATION OR ANY CONSUMER

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:57.826

01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:00.963
ALL INTENDED TO IN THE SOME

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.764
INDIAN LEGISLATION.

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:03.665
HAVING SAID ALL THAT -- I I WILL

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.334
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TO MOVE

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.935

THE CALIFORNIA HOME OF TECHNIQUE

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:17.752
[inaudible]

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:19.821
TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND THERE

01:29:19.887 --> 01:29:22.356
ARE HUGE HUGE OPPORTUNITIES THAT

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:24.325
BEEN A MALE AVAILABLE TO US TO

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:25.927

CONVENIENCE IS OUR DAILY LIVES

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:33.167

TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL SECTOR --

AND THOSE MAY ENTAIL NOT JUST

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:42.243
ISSUES AROUND LABOR AND

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:43.945
AUTOMATION WHICH WE'VE SEEN MANY

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:46.114

REDUCED INTO JUST DOLLARS AND

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:03.064
CENTS BUT RIGHT NOW THE WAY WE

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:05.533
INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY -- WE

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.468
ARE QUANTIFIED IN THAT WAY AND

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:09.470
SOME INTERNAL PROCESS THE GOAL

TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY WHICH

AND REALLY TRYING TO THINK

01:30:25.419 --> 01:30:26.954
THROUGH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:30.691

LIFE.

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:58.813
TAX REFORM MEANS MORE THAN JUST

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.514
PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:01.282
OBVIOUSLY WE THINK THAT'S

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:02.783
IMPORTANT AS CO SPONSORS THE

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:03.985
CCPA.

01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:05.186
TECH COMPANIES ARE BENEFITING

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:06.420
FROM A DATA CONNIE AND THEY NEED

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.855
TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.824
STRUGGLING WITH DISPLACEMENT AND

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:10.925
GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY.

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:12.093
WE FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:12.760
THEM TO CONTRIBUTE TO

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:14.395

INDIVIDUALS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT

01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:17.398
TO PRIVACY PRIVACY.

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:19.066
TECH COMPANIES PROFIT OFF OF US

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.102
THEY SHOULD BE PAYING BACK TO

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:21.602
SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS AND

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:22.370
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:23.771
CORPORATE PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:25.439
INCLUDING MY TECH COMPANIES ARE

01:32:25.506 --> 01:32:26.974
AN ALL TIME HIGH.

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.309
BUT THE PORTION OF TAX REVENUE

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:29.443
CALIFORNIA RECEIVED FROM

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:31.913
CORPORATIONS AS CLOSE TO ITS

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:32.914
LOWEST POINT AND FORTY YEARS.

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.248
THEY HAVE TO BE ACCOUNT HELD

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:36.484
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE IMPACT OF

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:38.286
MISINFORMATION THE MANIPULATION

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:39.787
OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.022
AND THE THREAT THAT THEY COULD

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:44.659
POSE TO OUR FREE PRESS.

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:45.893
CALIFORNIA HAS THE WORLD'S MOST

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.028
INNOVATIVE TECH COMPANIES

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.062
WORKING ON SOLVING SOME OF THE

01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:49.463
BIGGEST ISSUES OF OUR TIME WILL

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:50.765
DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY THAT MAKES

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:52.033
OUR LIVES AFER HEALTHIER AND

01:32:52.099 --> 01:32:53.367
MORE CONNECTED.

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:54.201
BUT AS WE SEE MANY OF OUR

01:32:54.268 --> 01:32:55.403
NEIGHBORS UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:56.737
IN THE OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:58.472
THIS INNOVATION ECONOMY WE THINK

01:32:58.539 --> 01:32:59.674
IT'S TIME FOR TECH TO GET BACK

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.142
THEY SHOULD CREATE NOT LIMIT

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:02.209
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:04.245
GENERATIONS AND THAT IS WHY WE

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:05.479
NEED AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT.

01:33:05.546 --> 01:33:07.415
EQUITY MEANS AS IT RELATES TO

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:09.183
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:10.051
THROUGH THIS ACT WE HOPE TO

01:33:10.117 --> 01:33:11.585
EXPLORE TAX IMPACTS ON

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.254
INEQUALITY OUR WORKFORCE THE

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:15.256
FUTURE OF A FREE PRESS AND TAX

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:16.757
IMPACT ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:17.825
SOCIAL CAPITAL.

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:19.226
THIS WILL HAPPEN BY ENGAGING THE

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:20.461
COMMUNITIES AND SECTORS MOST

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:21.829
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS AND

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:22.863
WITH THE MOST AT STAKE.

01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:23.998
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:25.366

BEING A PART OF THIS --

01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:49.423
GRAPPLING WITH SOME REALLY

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:52.193
VEXING ISSUES HERE A LOT OF A

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:53.627
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES I

01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:55.062
THINK WE HAVE IN THE STATE --

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:57.098
LOVE THE BILL OF A FORD WOULD

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:57.765
LIKE TO BE CALLED HER THANK YOU.

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.200
THANK YOU.

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:01.502
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:02.737
I JUST HAD OBSERVATION I I'D

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:04.005
BEEN STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:05.973
WITH THIS BILL SENATOR AND IT'S

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:06.841
BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND I

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:08.209
COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE THINGS

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:09.076
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:09.577
BILL.

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:11.245
I THINK THAT THAT KIND OF EQUITY

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:12.113
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:13.914
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- INCOME

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:15.616
INEQUALITY AS YOU POINT OUT HAS

01:34:15.683 --> 01:34:16.984
GOTTEN WORSE THROUGH THE

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:18.319
TECHNICAL REVOLUTION.

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:20.154
AND I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT I

01:34:20.221 --> 01:34:20.988
THINK IT'S THE DEFINING

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:22.556
CHALLENGE OF OUR GENERATION TO

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:23.891
TRY TO DRESS THAT INEQUALITY

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:24.859
SOME VERY SUPPORT OF THOSE

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:26.193
THINGS BUT I'M A LITTLE

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.628
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH POINTING THE

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:29.230
FINGER AT THE TECHNICAL

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:30.398
REVOLUTION.

01:34:30.464 --> 01:34:32.233
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:33.034
BECAUSE?

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.536
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC DATA.

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:37.405
THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN THE

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:39.273
GREATEST ENABLER OF THE CLASSES

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.741
OF PEOPLE THAT.

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:41.876
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP IN ALL OF

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:43.277
HUMAN HISTORY.

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:45.179
YEAH AND IF YOU DEFINE.

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:46.647
EMPOWER MEN NOT JUST AS INCOME

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:48.616
INEQUALITY BUT ALSO AS EQUITY

01:34:48.682 --> 01:34:49.650
AND YOU COMPARE IT TO THE

01:34:49.717 --> 01:34:50.885
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WE HAVE A

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:52.353
LOT MORE EQUITY NOW THAN WE DID

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.354
DOWN.

01:34:53.421 --> 01:34:54.789
BECAUSE BACK THEN YOU HAD

01:34:54.855 --> 01:34:56.457
FACTORY OWNERS WHO JUST BY

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:57.825
ACCIDENT OF BIRTH.

01:34:57.892 --> 01:34:59.827
WERE ABLE TO COMMAND THESE HUGE

01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:01.462
RETURNS ON THEIR WORKERS GOT

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.864
NOTHING WHEREAS IN TECHNOLOGY

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:06.067
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT -- IT'S

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:07.234
MUCH MUCH MORE BROADLY BASED NOW

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.436
IT IS TRUE THAT.

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:09.804
IT TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE WINNERS

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.072
AND LOSERS BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:12.406
REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:14.141
TO EMPLOY AND THEREFORE THAT

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:15.543
CREATES THAT ANY QUALITY BUT

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:16.911
THAT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:18.646
NUANCED ISSUE AND SO THAT'S

01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:19.146
THAT'S WHY I'M A LITTLE

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:19.980
UNCOMFORTABLE.

01:35:20.047 --> 01:35:20.781
WITH THE BILL BUT A VERY

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:22.183
SUPPORTIVE OF OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:23.350
TRYING TO DO IT AND JUST ONE

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:24.618
LAST COMMENT IN YES BUT I HATE

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:25.753
TO BE A LITTLE CYNICAL BUT WE'RE

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.354
ALL IN GOVERNMENT HERE -- YOU

01:35:27.421 --> 01:35:28.556
KNOW WE WE SEEM TO BE IMPLYING

01:35:28.622 --> 01:35:29.990
WITH THIS LEGISLATION THAT MORE

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:31.325
GOVERNMENT AND INTERVENTION

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:32.893
REGULATION IS GOING TO MAKE THE

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:35.796
SITUATION BETTER -- BECAUSE NO

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:36.564
ONE HAS EVER FAILED TO BE

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:37.331
TRUTHFUL.

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:38.399
SO SO THAT'S ANOTHER TO PIECES

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:39.800
SKEPTICISM THAT I HAVE BUT I

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:40.701
KNOW YOUR HEARTS IN THIS IN THE

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:42.169
RIGHT PLACE MY HEART'S WITH YOU

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:43.471
I JUST I JUST STRUGGLE A LITTLE

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.705
BIT WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:47.241
I I APPRECIATE THAT -- MISTER

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:52.847
VICE CHAIR YES -- AND I DO I

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:53.481
DON'T WANT THE THESIS OF THIS

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:54.348
LEGISLATION TO BE ONE OF

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.383
ACCUSATION AND I ACTUALLY I'M

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:58.486
I'M OPEN TO THINKING THROUGH

01:35:58.552 --> 01:35:59.019
WITH YOU.

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:01.755
HOW TO CAPTURE -- REALLY

01:36:01.822 --> 01:36:03.090
ACCURATELY THE THE BENEFITS

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:04.525
THEY'RE OF OF DEMOCRATIZING

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:06.393
ECONOMIC POWER THAT YOU'RE

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.496
TALKING ABOUT -- MY SENSE IS

01:36:08.562 --> 01:36:10.231
THAT THE INDUSTRY ACTUALLY WANTS

01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:12.566
TO STEP UP AND TRY TO TAKE A

01:36:12.633 --> 01:36:13.601
LITTLE DIFFERENT ROLE YOU LOOK

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:14.502
AT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT

01:36:14.568 --> 01:36:15.703
HAVE COME OUT COMPANIES LIKE

01:36:15.769 --> 01:36:17.872
MICROSOFT -- AND SOME OTHER

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:20.641
LEADERS IN THE FIELD -- THEY'RE

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:22.877
ANXIOUS TO FIND A BETTER VENUES

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:24.612
IN THE CURRENT SORT OF CAT AND

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:26.580
MOUSE GAME THAT WE'RE PLAYING OF

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:29.750
SHUT IT ALL DOWN OR AUTHORIZED

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:30.851
EVERYTHING SO I'M HOPING TO FIND

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:32.386
THAT SWEET -- BUT I APPRECIATE

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.155
THE CONCERNS AND FEEL ALLOW ME

01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:35.856
