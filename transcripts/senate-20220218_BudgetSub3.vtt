00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:23.021
SUCCESSFUL MODEL FOR US IN TERMS

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:25.290
OF BEING ABLE TO. AND IT REALLY

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:27.092
EXPEDITE SOME OF THE HIRING AND

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.261
WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE WILL

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.862
CONTINUE TO BRING ON THE OPEN

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.164
POSITIONS BUT THEN WE WILL ALSO

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:41.440

UNDER THESE NEW DOLLARS AND SOME

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:43.842
OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.344
REALLY GOOD GREAT AND THAT. THEY

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.712
BUILT ON THE RELAY. AND THE

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:48.847
SCALE THEY BILL IN THE CONGRESS

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.082
. WILL ALSO. AS WE AWAY FOR COAL

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:51.183
THAT RESPONSE INTO SOMEONE KEY

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:52.451
AREA WHERE WE PLAN TO REACH. SO

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.252
WE HOPING WE CAN MIX OF THOSE

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.253
PEOPLE. PERMANENT STATE

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.922
POSITIONS AND THEREBY GAIN FROM

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:57.990
ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE

00:20:58.056 --> 00:20:59.658
THAT THEY BROUGHT TO THE TABLE.

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:01.226
OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.095
I GUESS THE OTHER. QUESTION

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:05.097
RELATED AGAIN OVERALL WORK FORCE

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:07.833
IS THAT- YEAH THAT POINTED OUT.

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.735
IN THE PAST AT LEAST MOST OF THE

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.203
MONEY FOR C. PEACHES COME

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:13.538
THROUGH. ESSENTIALLY GRANTS AND

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:14.940
THINGS ARE FAIRLY DIRECTED FUNDS

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:16.575
I MEAN IF WE SEE THE BOXES AS

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:18.644
FEDERAL FUNDS BUT A LOT OF IT IS

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.848
FOR VERY SPECIFIC THINGS- AND

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:27.919
THAT. SO I GUESS. THE QUESTION

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.554
IS THAT. THE WORK. THESE GRANTS

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:30.555
FOR. OTHER TYPES OF FUNDS THAT

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:33.325

THAT YOU HAD TO YOU KNOW THERE

00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:37.796
THERE NEED TO BE SOME

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:39.631
FLEXIBILITY IN TIME IT'S- HOW

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:40.932
ARE YOU ABLE. HOW YOU DOING IN

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:42.901
TERMS OF KEEPING UP WITH THE

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.436
OTHER WORK HAS BEEN UNCOVERED

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:48.106
WORK. THAT WORKED AT CITY PAGES

00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:49.641
CONNECTED TO DO. I THINK IT IT

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:51.943
VARIES BY CENTER IN OFFICE-

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.878
CERTAINLY INVENT FACTIONS

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.980
DISEASE GROUP IS MORE IMPACTED

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:57.249
BUT ALSO THE FUNDERS ARE MARTINI

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:58.650
AND IN TERMS OF USING THOSE

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:00.152
STAFF AND REDIRECTING THEM

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:01.620

TO DAY JOB AS WELL. I'M SO I

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:08.927
THINK IN OTHER AREAS WE HAVE

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.562
BEEN ABLE TO BACK FILL SOME OF

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.564
THE POSITIONS WE'VE- REDIRECT IT

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:14.800
WE'RE STARTING TO DO MORE OF

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:15.934

BUSY TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:31.983
WORK BUT- THERE ARE SOME AREAS

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.719
AND WE DID SOME GAP ANALYSIS TO

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:35.787

THAT IS HIRING AND WE'VE GOT TO

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:48.266

HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON ON THIS

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:47.311
PROPOSAL WE THINK THE PLAN HAS A

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:49.914
NUMBER OF MERITS FOR EXAMPLE

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.849

AND PLANNING. AND WE LIKE TO

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:05.997
RATE THE REASON IDENTIFY A FEW

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:07.532
ISSUES WHICH WE THINK IS

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:10.101
ADDRESSED COULD- POTENTIALLY

00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:12.737
STRENGTHEN THE PLAN SO FIRST WE

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:14.839
KNOW THAT THE PLAN DOES NOT-

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:17.642
INCLUDES THREE- WHAT WE SEE AS

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:21.779
KEY OBJECTIVES SO. FIRST

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.214
ALTHOUGH IT HAS A MALL FACETED

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:26.150
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT TRAINING

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:27.952
AND INTERNAL EDUCATION AND

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:30.021
ADVANCEMENT FOR THE WORK FORCE

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.589
IT DOESN'T CREATE A WORKFORCE

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:35.693
PIPELINE. SECOND WE KNOW THAT IT

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.962
DOESN'T- INCLUDE DISCUSSION ON

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:40.298
STRENGTHENING THE STATE WIDE LAB

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.866
NETWORK PUBLIC HEALTH PLAN THAT

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:44.001
WORKS SPECIFICALLY SO THERE IS

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:47.538
FUNDING AND- POSITIONS FOR THE

00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:49.507
STATE LAB AND FOR STATE LAB

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:51.842
FIELD SERVICES BUT THERE ARE NO

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:53.110
REQUIREMENTS OR PLANS FOR

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:54.679
ENSURING THAT THE TWENTY EIGHT

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:58.282
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LABS. ARE

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.584
STAFFED AND SUSTAINED. THIRD WE

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.219
NOTE THAT- THE PLAN CURRENTLY

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:04.722
DOES NOT LAY OUT AN OVER ARCHING

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:07.091
I T. STRATEGY. SO THE

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:09.493
DEPARTMENTS- NOTED TO OUR OFFICE

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.928
THAT IT DOESN'T TEND TO HIRE A

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:12.797
CHIEF I. T. STRATEGIST AND

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:14.699
DEVELOPER- MORE OF A

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:16.834
COMPREHENSIVE IT STRATEGY FOR

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.036
THE DEPARTMENT. BUT WHEN THIS

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:21.138
PLAN WILL BE AVAILABLE AND HOW

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:23.541
THAT FUTURE- I. T. VERSION WOULD

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:27.178
BE FUNDED IT'S NOT ENTIRELY

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:29.213
CLEAR YET. NEXT WE NOTE THAT THE

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.848
PLAN WE THINK COULD HAVE

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.650
STRONGER OVERSIGHT OF THE LOCAL

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.652
HEALTH JURISDICTIONS SO RIGHT

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.454
NOW AS WRITTEN THE PLAN DOES NOT

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.689
LAY OUT MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OR

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:39.790
GOALS FOR LOCAL HEALTH

00:37:39.857 --> 00:37:42.360
DEPARTMENTS. WE DO KNOW THAT THE

00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:44.962
DEPARTMENT DOES INTEND TO-

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:47.632
COLLABORATE WITH THE LOCAL

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:51.168
DEPARTMENTS ON ON THESE ISSUES-

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:52.336
BUT WE THINK THAT- THIS IS AN

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:54.205
AREA THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:57.642
WANT TO- CONSIDER WEIGHING IN ON

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:59.443
. AND THEN- WE NOTE THAT THE

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:04.315
PLAN. HAS LOCAL LOCAL PUBLIC

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:07.018
HEALTH PLANS WOULD BE TIED TO

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:08.753
LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:10.988
COMMUNITY EXISTING COMMUNITY

00:38:11.055 --> 00:38:12.923
HEALTH ASSESSMENTS AND COMMUNITY

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.092
HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS WE JUST

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:16.627
SENT OUT A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:19.997
THIS APPROACH FIRST I'M NOT ALL

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.198
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:23.467
CURRENTLY HAVE I'M A COMMUNITY

00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:24.735
HEALTH ASSESSMENT- COMMUNITY

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:27.204
HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN I TURNER

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.673
STANDING THAT THEY WOULD BE

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.374
WORKING OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.109
TWO JUST TO DEVELOP THESE AND-

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:33.577
WE'RE NOT CLEAR IF THAT'S REALLY

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:35.579
ENOUGH TIME TO DEVELOP SORT OF

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:39.550
HIGH QUALITY- HEALTH ASSESSMENTS

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:40.151
IMPROVEMENT PLANS. SECOND WE

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.786
KNOW THAT THESE PLANS CAN

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:44.555
SOMETIMES- THE COMMUNITY HEALTH-

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:46.424
IN IMPROVEMENT PLANS CAN

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:47.892
SOMETIMES ENCOMPASS SCHOOLS THAT

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.493
ARE SORT OF BEYOND THE PURVIEW

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.529
OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS.

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:52.563
SUCH AS STRENGTHENING THE

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.098
HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IT OR

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:54.899
INCREASING STABLE HOUSING

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:58.069
OPTIONS. SO WE RAISE THIS JUST

00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:59.804
TO SAY THAT TYING LOCAL HEALTH

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.339
PLANS DIRECTLY TO THESE ARE

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.041
COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS AND

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:04.875
COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.677
PLANS. MAY NOT BE THE BEST

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:08.713
SUBSTITUTE FOR HAVING SORT OF A

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:09.980
MORE DELIBERATE AND CONSISTENT

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:12.283
TYPE OF LOCAL PLAN A CALL ACROSS

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:15.352
LOCAL DEPARTMENTS- HAVING A

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:16.821
HAVING A MORE CONSISTENT TYPE OF

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:20.658
LOCAL PLAN WOULD ALSO MAKE THE

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:21.826
STATEWIDE EVALUATION EASIER. THE

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.227
JUST A FEW ISSUES FOR

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:26.363
LEGISLATIVE CONCERN- FIRST WE

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.232
THINK- THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:30.000
CONSIDER ASKING FOR MORE

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:30.968
INFORMATION FROM THE

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.403
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.537
OBJECTIVES THAT WERE NOT

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:34.905
INCLUDED IN THE PLAN THAT WE

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:36.307
HAVE IDENTIFIED SO WORK FIRST

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:38.309
PAY BLIND PUBLIC HEALTH LAB

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.444
NETWORK ACROSS THE STATE AN OVER

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:42.913
ARCHING I STRATEGY. WE THINK

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.348
THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:47.084
CONSIDER REQUIRING MORE CDPH

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:49.320
MANAGEMENT OF THE LOCAL PLAN

00:39:49.386 --> 00:39:51.489
DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS OVERSIGHT

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:55.926
OF THE LOCAL- ON USE OF FUNDS-

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.261
AND- AS I NOTED BEFORE THE

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.462
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:00.097
CONSIDER IDENTIFYING SOME OF THE

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:01.766
COMMON PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS IT

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:03.901
WOULD LIKE TO SEE- PRIORITISED

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.636
ACROSS THE STREET. ACROSS THE

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:08.072
STATE- THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:09.573
ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER SOME

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.942
SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE REPORTING

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:15.179

REVIEW AND- IF IT WERE TO DO

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.121
THAT TYPE OF GROUP REVIEW WE

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:26.891
RECOMMEND- HAVING THAT CONDUCTED

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:29.827
BY AN OUTSIDE PARTY- FINALLY WE

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:31.162
NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:32.496
PROPOSES TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:34.832
SPENDING PLAN. THROUGH BUDGET

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:36.867
BILL LANGUAGE AND WE SUGGEST

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.836
DEVELOPING INSTEAD TRAILER BILL

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.604
LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH THE PLAN'S

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:44.375
REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU VERY

CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:55.986
THAT PIPELINE AND WE'VE HEARD A

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:57.888
LOT ABOUT WORK FORCE ACROSS ALL

00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:02.660

AHEAD. SO I THINK THEY'RE NOT OF

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:08.532
THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO DO TO

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:11.168
TRY TO BUILD THE PIPELINE. ONE

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:12.603
YEAH WE HAVE SHORT TERM AND LONG

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:13.838
TERM GOALS AS WE LOOK AT OUR

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.806
WORK FORCE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AN

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:16.540
AGING POPULATION AND WE ALSO

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:18.776
KNOW THAT WE NEED TO RECRUIT-

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:21.245
I'M MORE DIVERSE. WORK FORCE AND

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.780
SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.783
DOING IS. REALLY LOOKING AT I'M

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.685

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:32.189
SHOULD YOU COME TO WORK FOR

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:33.924
PUBLIC HEALTH HOW IS IT DISTINCT

00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:35.926
FROM HEALTH CARE AND WE'RE GONNA

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.528
WORK WITH OUR LOCAL. HEALTH

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:38.762
JURISDICTIONS TO COME UP WITH

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:40.564
THAT TIME AND WE REALLY THINK

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.132
THAT THAT'LL BE A START TO TRAIN

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:44.201
TO ATTRACT NOT ONLY. PEOPLE FROM

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:46.203
THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO MAYBE

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.872
STUDENTS AND OTHERS WE PUT IN

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:49.340
PLACE THIS YEAR WHAT WE'RE

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:50.808
CALLING OUR PATHWAYS PROGRAM

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.710
WHERE WE'VE TAKEN FORTY FIVE

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:53.978
PEOPLE FROM. VERY DIFFERENT

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:55.946
BACKGROUNDS AND PLACED THEM WE

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.815
HAVE A TRAINING PROGRAM WE

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:59.350
PLACED FORTY FIVE PEOPLE IN

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:00.851
ACROSS THE STATE AND LOCAL

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:03.053
HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. ALL AND

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:03.988
BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER SO THEY

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:05.856
THEY GET SOME STATE EXPERTISE

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.892
AND TRAINING BUT THEY ALSO GOT

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.193
SOME LOCAL EXPERIENCE AND WE

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.461
THINK IT'S A WAY NOT ONLY TO

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:12.096
GROW THE PIPELINE. TO GET PEOPLE

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:14.164
INTERESTED IN THIS WORK TO GET

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:15.099
THEM EXPERIENCE THAT THEY

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:17.301
QUALIFY FOR SOME OF THE HEALTH-

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:19.236
POSITIONS BUT ALSO WE CAN PLACE

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:20.337
THEM IN SOME OF THE COUNTIES

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.740
THAT STRUGGLE TO. TO HIRE AND SO

00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:24.708
THAT'S ONE WAY TO GROW THE

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:26.644
PATHWAY WE ARE WORKING AND HAVE

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.245
BEEN WORKING WITH ON. OUR

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:29.880
INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AND THE

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:31.982
IMPACT IT WE'VE HIRED PROBABLY A

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.851
THIRD OF THE INTERNS THAT COME

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:35.352
TO OUR DEPARTMENT. ACROSS THE

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:38.589
CSU ON CAMPUSES. AND WE WANT TO

00:42:38.656 --> 00:42:40.124
EXPAND THAT AND WE WANT TO DO

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.326
MORE WITH HIGH SCHOOLS AS WELL-

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.061
AND OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALSO

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:46.096
WANT TO BECAUSE I CAN. SAY WHEN

00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:47.264
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULDN'T

00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:48.465
HE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT A

00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:49.700
CAREER IN PUBLIC HEALTH. I

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:50.834
SCHOOL STUDENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.069
WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS

00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:53.370
NECESSARILY MAYBE NOT WITH THE

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.139
PANDEMIC. THAT'S CHANGING A

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:56.473
LITTLE BIT BUT I THINK THERE ARE

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.776
A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO

00:42:58.842 --> 00:42:59.743
TRY TO MAKE PUBLIC. YOU KNOW

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:00.878
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT A FIREMAN AS

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.079
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT A PUBLIC

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:09.186
HEALTH WORKER ANTS AND SO. HOW

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:10.287
DO WE START TO REALLY GROW THAT

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:11.355
HOW WE PARTNER MORE WITH THE-

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:11.956
INSTITUTE. AND WITH OUR COME

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.590
BASED OR- BECAUSE THEY

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:14.124
EXPERIENCE THAT THEY- THE

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:14.925
COMMUNITY. CAN BE HELP TO.

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:16.393
PUBLIC HEALTH FORWARD SHOULD BUT

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.862
pHAVE. THAT WE LOOK AT THE

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:20.297
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS WERE

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:21.899
LIVED EXPERIENCE CAN BE AS-

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.500
IMPORTANT. AND THE WORK THAT

00:43:23.567 --> 00:43:25.135
THEY'RE DOING AS SOME OF THE

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:25.936
ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS THAT WE

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:27.805
MAY HAVE BEEN SO WE MAY NEED TO.

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.273
HAVE SOME NEW CLASSIFICATIONS

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.407
THAT HELP US TO BUILD THAT

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:33.210
PIPELINE AS WELL. AND SO TRYING

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:35.346
TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS ACROSS.

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:36.880
THE STATE TO TRY TO ADD TRACKED

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.449
MORE AND A BUILD A PIPELINE WITH

00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:39.683
SCHOOLS WITH COMMUNITY BASED

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.353
ORGANIZATIONS. AND BY LOOKING

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:43.854
FURTHER INTO OUR WHAT WE LEARNED

00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:45.322
DURING THE PANDEMIC AND PROBABLY

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:47.424
HAVE KNOWN. FOR SOME TIME AS WE

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:48.459
NEED TO ATTRACT PEOPLE WITH

00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:49.059
DIFFERENT SKILLS THAT.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.661
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH AT B.

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:51.962
WE NEED ALL OF THAT WE NEED OUR

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.731
SCIENTISTS. BUT WE ALSO NEED THE

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.099
STRATEGISTS AND WE NEED PEOPLE

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.667
WHO. BUILD STRATEGIC

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.035
PARTNERSHIPS WE NEED

00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:00.037
INFOGRAPHICS PEOPLE WE NEED TO.

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:01.171
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:03.207
POSITIONS THAT. FILL OUT OUR

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:08.979
WORK FORCE AND SO REALLY. KIND

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:09.847
OF LOOKING ACROSS THE DIFFERENT.

00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:11.248
SECTOR OF SOCIETY LOOKING WALK

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:12.149
WHAT CAN WE ADD TO OUR PUBLIC

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:15.085
HEALTH WORK FOR. HOUSING HELPS

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:17.321
WITH THAT. I THINK. IT'S BEEN SO

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:19.289
LONG WE'VE JUST BEEN IN THE

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:20.591
TRENCHES. THERE HASN'T BEEN- THE

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.159
TIME OR ATTENTION TO KINDA LOOK

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.161
UP AND LOOK FORWARD. CAN YOU

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.763
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LAB

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.931
NETWORK WE ALL HEARD A LOT ABOUT

00:44:27.998 --> 00:44:28.665
THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:30.667
PANDEMIC- AND THEN OFTENTIMES

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:32.102
COUNTIES WERE CONTRACTING WITH

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.570
LAB SAID. THAT WEREN'T QUITE

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:35.839
REPUTABLE ANALYSTS DID UP A

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:38.442
DISASTER WITH DATA. BEING ABLE

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.576
TO GET AROUND CAN YOU TALK A

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:40.978
LITTLE BIT ABOUT MORE ABOUT THE

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:44.181
LAB NETWORK. LOCALLY AND THE

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:46.050
INVESTMENT OUR OUR PLANS FOR

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:47.951
FUTURE INVESTMENT IN THAT. SO WE

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:49.153
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:50.721
PUBLIC HEALTH LABS AND

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:52.656
UNFORTUNATELY THAT TIME LINE FOR

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:53.690
PUTTING THIS PLAN TOGETHER

00:44:53.757 --> 00:44:55.559
DIDN'T ALLOW US ENOUGH TIME. BUT

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:57.428
WE REALLY ARE THINKING THROUGH

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:59.897
WHAT. NOT ONLY HOW MANY LABS DO

00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:01.065
WE NEED ACROSS THE STATE AND

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.766
PUBLIC HEALTH BUT WHAT SHOULD

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.668
THEY BE DOING. AND WHAT PUBLIC

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:06.603
HEALTH LABS AT WHAT LEVEL SHOULD

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.372
TAKE ON WHAT WORK BECAUSE WE

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:09.807
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE-

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:11.475
DUPLICATION. WE RECOGNIZE WE

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:12.943
NEED TO HAVE A STRONG LABORATORY

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.446
NETWORK WHERE. EVERY STATE EVERY

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:18.115
COUNTY HAS ACCESS TO THE TESTING

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:20.050
THAT THEY NEED AND SO WE WILL BE

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:22.352
COMING BACK TO THAT. IN TERMS

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.921
OF. YOU KNOW OUR LABS HAVE BEEN

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:25.923
WORKING ACROSS THE NETWORK TO

00:45:25.989 --> 00:45:27.357
MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:28.892
THINK THROUGH WHAT THAT LOOKS

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:31.028
LIKE. AND WE'RE PROBABLY SIX

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:32.262
MONTHS UNDER BRAND IF YOU HAVE

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:33.430
COMMENTS ON THIS BUT WE'RE

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:35.165
PROBABLY. SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:36.300
OUT AND MAKING SOME

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:38.535
RECOMMENDATIONS THEY'RE- LOOKING

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:39.770
AT RECRUITMENT LOOKING AT

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:42.573
TRAINING- YOU KNOW IT'S- REALLY

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:44.675
HARD FOR US WHEN WE HEAR THAT

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:45.809
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HAS ALL THE

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:47.511
EQUIPMENT AND THEY CAN'T FIND A

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.012
LAB DIRECTOR AND THEY HAVEN'T

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.447
BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THEIR LAB OPEN

00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:52.382
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A LAB

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:53.750
DIRECTOR- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.152
SURE WE HAVE TRAINING PROGRAMS

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:57.187
WE HAVE AGAIN. A PIPELINE TO

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:58.889
BRING PEOPLE AND TO YOU OUR

00:45:58.956 --> 00:46:01.825
LABORATORY POSITIONS AND RELATED

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:03.127
TRAINING THEM AND SO WE PUT SOME

00:46:03.193 --> 00:46:10.300
MONEY. ON IN OUR- MAN PLAN THAT

00:46:10.367 --> 00:46:12.035
WOULDN'T. TRAINING FOR LAB AS-

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:14.071
AND I KNOW. THAT THE COALITION

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:14.938
ALSO HAS SOME. ON FURTHER

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.874
TRAINING. T. WE'RE- EXPAND ON

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.510
OUR LABORATORY NETWORK. AND I

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:20.844
DON'T KNOW IF TOMAS OR BRANDON

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:23.347
HAVE ANY MORE TO SAY ON THE LAB.

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:29.319
YEAH NOT NOTHING TRACK. OKAY AND SPEAKING OF THE LAB AND

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:32.756
LOCALS IT. AS AS YOU SERVE AS A

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.591
HUB AND I KNOW OUR MIGHT MIGHT

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:36.326
HELP DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN IN A

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:38.128
LOT OF CONTACT I HAVE SOME

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:40.297
CONCERNS ABOUT. ABOUT COUNTIES

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:42.699
THAT ARE POLLUTING- SPECIAL

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:43.567
PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS AT A

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:46.136
HIGHER RATE AND IF THE PLAN AS

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:47.604
OF THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:50.240
COULD HAS A PLAN OF WHAT WE DO

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.609
IF WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO SEND

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:55.779
MORE RESOURCES. TO THIRTY TWO

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.014
COUNTIES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.482
WITH THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH BUT

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:02.152
HAVE HIGH DEGREES OF- OF DISEASE

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.488
AND NEED IN THEIR AREAS. I THINK

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:06.089
THAT'S WHAT THE CAP CAPACITY

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:07.591
BUILDING THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:08.859
THESE DOLLARS WERE- ALLOW US TO

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:11.261
DO MORE- I'M WE WILL ALSO HELP

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:13.430
TO TRY TO RECRUIT. PEOPLE FOR AT

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:14.731
THE LOCAL LEVEL AND USE SOME

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.466
STRATEGIES LIKE THE PATHWAYS

00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:18.068
PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN PLACE

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:19.870
PEOPLE BUT ALSO WORKING WITH

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:21.305
CONTRACTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:21.939
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT THROUGHOUT

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.907
THE PANDEMIC TO PLACE PEOPLE IN

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.542
SOME OF THESE HARD TO PLACE.

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:27.177
COUNTIES WHERE YEAH THEY HAVE

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:28.912
EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE THE DOLLARS

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:30.280
AND THEY HAVE THE POSITION THEY

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:31.748
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT AND

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:32.983
SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.917
DIFFERENT MODELS OF BRINGING

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:36.220
PEOPLE AND DOING SOME ROTATIONS

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:37.988
MAYBE BRING A MAN TO A STATE

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.556
POSITION BUT- HAVING THEM ROTATE

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.892
THROUGH- AND- I THINK WE HAVE

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:43.160
SOME MODELS FOR THAT CDC

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.494
CERTAINLY HAS SOME MODELS FOR

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.862
THAT. AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AT

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:47.698
THAT BECAUSE WE DO YOU KNOW WE

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:51.802
KNOW. THAT THERE ARE SOME AREAS

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:52.736
OF THE STATE THAT GO. AFP OUT.

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:54.137

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:36.573
BEEN AND ALSO THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.508
HAS BEEN RAISING THESE ISSUES

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:41.411
FOR YEARS- EVEN PRE COATED. WITH

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:43.680
A SET OF MENTIONED- I'VE CHAIRED

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:51.021
PRIOR TO COVE ID ABOUT PUBLIC

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:54.057
HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE I'VE KNOWN

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.959
I KNOW I'VE CHALLENGED MY- NOT

00:49:56.026 --> 00:49:57.060

A PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:05.669

WAS STARTING AND- THAT WAS ONE

00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:14.244
OF THE QUESTIONS I ASKED

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:16.880
DIRECTOR THEN- IT'S HAPPENED

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:19.015
PREVIOUSLY. IN A GUEST YOU KNOW

AGAIN I. APPRECIATE THE

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.855

ALL THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE A

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.768
WORKFORCE ISSUE NOW SOME OF THAT

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:39.302
OF COURSE IS OUR FAULT IN PUBLIC

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:41.438
POLICY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:45.308
TERMS OF FUNDING- A SHARED A

00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.244
FUNDING STREAM THAT WAS STABLE

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:49.012
WAS NOT NECESSARILY THAT MAKES

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:49.880
ALWAYS HARD FOR WORK FORCE

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:52.015
RIGHT. I MEAN IT'S GREAT YOU CAN

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:52.783
EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT PUBLIC

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.151

SO. SO I DO WANT A KNOWLEDGE

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.691

IMPORTANT WE CAN DO THAT THIS IS

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.296

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:45.048
DO YOU MAKE HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.316
DEPORT. REPORT COMBINED WITH

00:54:46.383 --> 00:54:48.051
EVIDENCE AND THEN TWO AND THEN

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:48.852
TO WORK WITH PARTNERS TO MAKE A

00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:50.787
DIFFERENCE. SO THERE THERE IS A

00:54:50.854 --> 00:54:52.188
LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THAT

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:53.957
HAS BEEN MISSING. AND FOR ME

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:55.592
THAT'S THE REASON WHY I CAME

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:56.993
FROM LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH THE

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.828
STATE PUBLIC HEALTH. BECAUSE I

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.130
ANTICIPATED IT JUST WITH THE

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:01.931
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOME OF THIS

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.733
MONEY AND FIX SOME OF THESE

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.535
ISSUES. I AGREE WITH YOU WE DO

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:07.804
THINGS WE DO THINGS- NOT FAST

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:10.206
ENOUGH- AND I'M REALLY COMMITTED

00:55:10.273 --> 00:55:11.274
TO DOING THAT SO THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.276
ONE OF THE REASONS. WHY IT WERE

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:21.051
AT AS AN ORGANIZATION. OR HAVING

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:22.652
A STRONG. THE FOCUS ON BECAUSE A

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:23.486
LEADER. TO ME SURE THAT WE DO

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:25.321
THING FAST. AND BETTER FOR CUT.

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.289
THE ULTIMATE BECAUSE- WHICH IS

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:28.124
EVERY CAL. BUT ALL THE BUILD THE

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:29.893
LEAD. AS WELL THEY WERE

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.428
ACCOUNTABLE TO YOU AND WE WANT

00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:33.496
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T WE

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:34.464
DELIVER. OUTCOMES UT WE DO IT

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.299
IN A WAY THAT SEE EFFICIENT. AND

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:37.701
THEY WERE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE

00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:39.169
PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:41.004
HEALTH. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:42.405
APPRECIATE THAT BUT WHAT I THINK

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.641
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S TENDS

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:47.110
TO HAPPEN IS THAT- YOU KNOW. WE

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:50.013
NEED TO DO THINGS RIGHT- IS

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.682
THAT- PEOPLE WANT TO THIS REALLY

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:55.852
THOROUGH YOU KNOW ANALYSIS AND

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:56.786
WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE YOU

00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:59.489
DATA AT CETERA. AND THEN WE SAID

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:00.623
ONE TOTALLY GATHER ALL THAT

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.425
TOGETHER WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:04.761
RIGHT AND THEN IT'S GONNA TAKE

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:05.762
US TWO OR THREE YEARS TOGETHER

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:07.564
ALL THAT GREAT IN FACT ACTUALLY

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.599
PUBLIC HEALTH DID DO. SOME MANY

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:11.401
YEARS AGO. THEY DID THIS BIG

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:12.669
THING WHERE EVERY LOCAL HEALTH

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:14.337
DEPARTMENT CETERA AND THEN THEY

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:15.572
CAME OUT WITH A REPORT IT SAID

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:17.941
ON THE SHELF AND THE BY THE TIME

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:18.875
WE GOT BACK TO IT IT'S LIKE WELL

00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:19.843
IT'S KINDA OLD NOW IT'S NOT

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:20.710
REALLY RELEVANT. AND LIKE

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.345
NOTHING HAPPENED. SO I DON'T SEE

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:24.314
THAT HAPPEN- I THINK WHEN IT

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.849
COMES TO THE LOCAL OVERSIGHT

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.417
WHEN THEY HEAR FROM SOME OF THE

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:29.219
LOCALS- IN THE PANEL COMING UP.

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:30.620
IT REALLY IS TO BE SURE WE

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:31.621
ACTUALLY HAVE A STATEWIDE.

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:33.490
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM SO AND THAT

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:35.325
OF COURSE WE HAVE C. PH AT STATE

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:36.893
BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOCAL HEALTH

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.861
DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE OF COURSE

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:39.696
ALL THE OTHER PIECES AS WELL. WE

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:41.097
WANNA BE SURE THAT IT THAT WE

00:56:41.164 --> 00:56:41.931
DON'T HAVE THE PROPERTY IN

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:43.166
SILENCE SO FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:45.101
NO YOU BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON THIS

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:49.672
R. R. IS THAT- SO. YOU KNOW WE

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.241
KNOW DISEASES DON'T STOP AT

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.876
POLITICAL BOUNDARIES RIGHT SO

00:56:52.942 --> 00:56:54.377
OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:55.345
OFTEN DEFINED BY POLITICAL

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:56.546
BOUNDARIES BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:57.714
A COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR

00:56:57.781 --> 00:56:58.915
CITY HELP APART WHATEVER RIGHT

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:01.284
SO. HOW DO WE GET AND THE YOUNG

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:02.118
PEOPLE WORK I KNOW YOU CAME TO

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:03.486
THE BAY AREA THERE WAS A

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:04.220
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE BAY

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.555
AREA HEALTH OFFICERS HOW WE DO

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.290
MORE OF THAT BUT THEN ALSO HOW

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:08.258
CAN THE STATE. ALSO PROVIDE

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:09.692
INCENTIVES. AND ALSO

CAN WE BUILD THAT IN WITH THIS

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:22.572
INVESTMENT. AND THEN. THERE'S

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:23.473
ACCOUNTABILITY TO SO THAT THE

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.607
STATE MY MANY IS. THE ONLY

00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:26.342
COURSE PORTING. YEAH THEY GO TO

00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:27.510
A LOCAL SINCE. TO LOW ACTIVITY

00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:28.678
BUT ALL. THAT THE- ALSO IN. FOR

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:29.779
THEM BE WORKING TOGETHER SO

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:30.747
WORKING WITH. BY THAT'S THE

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.715
LAVISH. A PRIME EXAMPLE WHERE.

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:33.349
BASICALLY H. K. WAS A ON THERE-

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:35.084
OWN FIGURE. HOW TO DO THEIR LAB.

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:36.052
RIGHT AND THEN. IF DECIDE TO. A

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:37.654
LOT AND THE WAY WHAT KIND OF

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.222
IT'S A WORKFORCE. I APPRECIATE.

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.657

CAN SUPPORT ALLOWED TO CONFINE

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:43.326
THE LAB DIRECTOR RATES. SO WE

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:44.527
HAVE TO BUILD THAT WORK FORCE

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:48.031
OUT TOO BUT- WE SHOULD HAVE A-

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:49.465
SO. SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY SHOULD

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:51.167
BE CONSENSUS IMAC THINKING ABOUT

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:53.136
OKAY SO WHICH LANDS DO WE NEED

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:55.038
BOTH STATE LAB. AND LOCAL LABS

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:56.873
RIGHT DO WE YEAH DO WE NEED TO

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.708

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:00.710
UP. DO WE HAVE TO IS THAT SO.

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:01.978
BUT THESE ARE BEING DONE

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:02.846
SYSTEMATICALLY IS KIND OF DONE

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.214
BY. SO I CAN'T EVEN MAKE A

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.381
DECISION AND THEN ALL THE OTHER

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:06.516
COUNTIES AROUND WOULD HAVE TO

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:08.818
JUST THAT RIGHT WHETHER DATE IS.

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:11.287
MAY DECIDE TO CLOSE THE LAB SO-

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:13.323
SO WE NEED MUCH MORE. SO WE

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.425
THINK WE DO NEED TO HAVE A-

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:16.626
DIRECTION TOWARD. THIS

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:18.328
COLLABORATION TO BUILD A PUBLIC

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:20.530
HEALTH SYSTEM. AND OF COURSE I

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:22.198
MEAN IDEALLY NATIONALLY AS WELL

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:24.234
BUT- CERTAINLY SOME TOWARDS THE

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.768
GOVERNMENT. A CALIFORNIA BIG

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.537

HEALTH. IT SYSTEMS AS WELL RIGHT

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:44.087
BECAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE RIGHT NOW

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:44.921
UNTIL THAT WE'RE HEARING STORIES

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:47.223

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:11.859
TESTIMONY. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:13.995
FOR. CAN BE BETTER FINE- YEAH I

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.496
DO THEY SHARED CONCERNS I IT'S A

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:17.398
BIT PROBLEMATIC. THIS IS POINTED

THE COMPANY LAND. FOR EXAMPLE

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:22.370
WHERE WEATHER SERVICE AREAS ALL

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:29.677
CURRENTLY PROVIDE- BECAUSE- BUT

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:30.978
MY GUESS. ALTHOUGH AGAIN I

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:33.447
ALWAYS APPRECIATE DATA. IS THAT

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:34.582
HOSPITALS IN LOWER INCOME

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:37.818
COMMUNITIES PROBABLY ALREADY-

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:39.887
HAVE FEWER RESOURCES- THEY TEND

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:42.490
TO HAVE THE- MORE MEDIC TELL US-

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:43.724
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE WE PAY A

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:45.293
FEW RESOURCES AND THEREFORE BE

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:46.827
MIGHT DO. A PROPORTIONAL S.

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:48.362
COMMUNITIES OTHER COMMUNITIES

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:50.164
THAT DON'T HAVE A LOCAL HOSPITAL

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:51.165
WITH THE ABOUT LOVE A RURAL

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:53.234
COMMUNITIES. SO THEN YOU KNOW IF

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:54.802
WE'RE GONNA SAY 25% WELL HOW'S

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.203
THAT DISTRIBUTED ACROSS OUR

01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:57.738
STATE RIGHT WHERE WHERE THERE'S

01:32:57.805 --> 01:32:59.473
A SIDE FROM THE OTHER MECHANICAL

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.942
ILLEGAL ISSUES AND SO FORTH

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:02.777
ABOUT. HOW YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:04.211
DIRECT THE MONEY ETCETERA. JUST

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:05.579
EEN TO DISTURB YOU KNOW WHERE

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:06.614
THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY SITTING

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:07.815
RIGHT NOW ALREADY DISTRIBUTED IN

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.150
A WAY SINCE YOU'RE DEPENDING ON

01:33:09.216 --> 01:33:11.419
HOSPITALS- IN A WAY THAT

01:33:11.485 --> 01:33:14.655
ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE NEED- AS

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:18.092
WELL AND- AND SO. I THINK THAT'S

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:20.494
PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING AND-

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:21.762
NOT SURE THAT'S REALLY THE MIGHT

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:23.998
BREAK MECHANISM BUT- CERTAINLY

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:25.199
WOULD APPRECIATE IF THAT'S TO

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.767
CONTINUE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:28.202
THATMUCH MORE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.870
OF HOW DO YOU SURE. WE MEET

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:31.572
THOSE COLORS THAT WERE TALKED

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:32.840
ABOUT BEFORE IN TERMS OF EQUITY

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.542
AND SO FORTH AND HOW THOSE

01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:36.210
RESOURCES DISTRIBUTED- BEFORE

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:37.445
WE'D ENTERED YEAH SEARCH

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:41.615
ENTERTAIN- ADOPTING THAT

01:33:41.682 --> 01:33:43.417
GUESS ONE LAST QUESTION IS THAT.

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:44.952
IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY OUT REACH

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:45.920
AND WE TALKED YOU KNOW EVERY P.

C. C. TEN AND C. H. I TALK ABOUT

01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:49.657
THE COMING OUT RIGHT. NOW WE

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:51.258
DEVELOPED A MODEL FOR THE

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:52.426
CENSUS. I MEAN IT WAS A SORT OF

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:53.627
BIG CAMPAIGN WE NEED TO GET

01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:54.929
PEOPLE THOUGHT SENSES ND SO

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:55.629
FORTH AND I KNOW SOME OF THE

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.365
FOLKS I BELIEVE WHO WORKED ON

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:59.133
THAT ARE EACH ARE NOW WORKING

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.002
WITH CPS THAT C. P. H. ON SOME

01:34:01.068 --> 01:34:03.137
OF THE OUTRAGE. THAT WAS THAT

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:06.507
WAS THAT POTENTIALLY- THE MODEL

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.209
THAT THEY HOPE WILL THE LESSONS

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:09.910
WE LEARNED FROM THAT WAS IT IT

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:10.945
DID THREE IT IS SOMETHING WE

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:12.179
SHOULD LEARN FROM THAT AND TERMS

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:14.148
OF OUR APPROACH FOR. AN ONGOING

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:17.985
EFFORT TO STAY IN PUBLIC HEALTH-

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.553
TO BUILD THOSE- COMMUTER

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.689
RELATIONSHIPS AND- AND

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:23.190
MESSAGING. YEAH LET ME ASK

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:24.992
ASSISTANCE IN LA TO TALK ABOUT

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:26.260
THAT BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN WORKING

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:36.103
ON A VACCINE AREA WHERE THAT.

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:37.271
SPEND IT. IN A PART APART. OF

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:40.541
OUR VACCINE AFTER. YEAH I'M

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:41.609
SORRY THINK WE WERE A LOT A LOT

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:43.778
THROUGH THAT THOSE PART WITH

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.012
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CD ACROSS

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:46.147
THE STATE THAT THERE ARE A

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:46.981
CRITICAL PART IN OUR BACK

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:48.215
STRATEGY IN TERMS NOT ONLY

01:34:48.282 --> 01:34:49.750
BRINGING THE RESOURCE TO COME BY

01:34:49.817 --> 01:34:50.951
DR THE DEMAND AND HELP TO ANSWER

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:51.852
ADDRESS. THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:53.120
LEVEL- WE DEFINITELY SEE THE

01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:55.322
PARTNERS SO CBO A CRITICAL TO

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:57.658
IMPROVING HEALTH I THINK YOU ARE

01:34:57.725 --> 01:35:00.361
ON WORK ON THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:01.695
IS CERTAINLY CERTAINLY A

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.064
PARTIALLY AN ANSWER I THINK THAT

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:05.232
IT DOES BRING SOME RESOURCES IT

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:06.400
WON'T BRING IT EVERYWHERE IN THE

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:08.035
STATE BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THIS

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.570
WON'T REACH EVERY CORNER OF THE

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:10.838
STATE IN TERMS OF WHERE THE

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:12.740
HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED. THERE ARE

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:14.175
SOME TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WE'RE

01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:15.776
WORKING THROUGH THOSE WE'RE

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:17.378
TRYING TO COME UP WITH THAT WORD

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:17.945
DRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:19.914
BROUGHT UP BY NOT ONLY THE

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.749
HOSPITALS BUT BY SOME OF THE

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:23.350
CBO'S IN TERMS OF HOW WE MIGHT

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:25.419
MAKE THIS WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:26.887
THE INVESTMENTS AND WE'VE WE'VE

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:28.656
DONE SOME MASTER MASTER H. GUY

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:30.758
OF WHAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT COULD

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:32.493
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE ABOUT SIX

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.228
BILLION DOLLARS SPENT ON

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.996
COMMUNICATING ON. THE BENEFIT

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:38.432
NOW OF THAT ABOUT FOUR BILLION

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.734
OF IT IS ON UNCOMPENSATED CARE

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:42.236
SO WE WOULDN'T BE TOUCHING THAT

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.972
MONEY BUT 25% OF THE REST OF THE

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:46.640
MONEY IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:48.843
AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT THERE ARE

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:49.610
SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THE

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.512
REACH OF THAT WHAT THIS MONEY

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:53.047
GETS SPENT ON SO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:54.548
CLARIFY AND COME UP WITH A

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.750
SOLUTION THAT WOULD HELP US TO

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:57.985
REALLY DRIVE COLLECTIVE IMPACT

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:00.454
AND- FOCUS ON EQUITY AND SOME OF

01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:01.922
THE ISSUES WHERE WE DO WANT TO

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:03.824
SEE THESE INVESTMENTS GO. AND

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:04.925
YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK IT WILL

01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:06.427
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO GET

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:07.695
THESE IN PLACE AND TO MOVE THE

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:09.330
DIAL BETWEEN WHERE THEY'RE

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:11.031
INVESTED NOW AND HOW WE GET

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:12.833
CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THAT I

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.335
THINK WE'RE ALSO DRIVING TOWARDS

01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:15.870
TRANSPARENCY IN THE REPORTING

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:17.271
AND HOW THIS INFORMATION GETS

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:19.440
REPORT IT- SOME MORE WORK TO

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:20.541
COME WILL BE SHARING THE

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:23.077
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- AS WE

01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:24.211
FLUSH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:25.980
BUT CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:28.482
IMPORTANCE AND- COMMUNITY OUT OF

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:35.589
IT. YOUR COMMUNITY BASED.

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:36.123
ORGANIZATIONS IN IMPROVING

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:36.957
PUBLIC I'LL- ACROSS THE STATE

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:38.626
AND I THINK P. H. I. AMAZING

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:40.060
AND- OF. CONTACT RACER AND WORK

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:41.495
WITH OUR LAW JURIST. AND SHOWING

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:42.763
. THE WAY THAT WE CAN WORK

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:43.564
DIFFERENTLY AND THEN IN OUR

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:45.633
VACCINE STRATEGIES. THAT WORK

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:47.601
ACROSS COMMUNICATIONS AND THEN

01:36:47.668 --> 01:36:49.737
WITH OUR CBO'S TO REALLY PUT

01:36:49.803 --> 01:36:51.472
RESOURCES PARTICULARLY IN THE

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:53.841
AREAS WHERE. WE WERE NOT SEEING

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:55.209
THE MOST IMPACT ON THE LEAST

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:57.344
RESOURCES SO THAT WE SAW. THAT

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:58.746
TESTING WHERE WE PLACED OUR

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:00.114
TESTING SITES WHERE WE PLACED

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:01.682
OUR VACCINE CLINICS AND MOBILE

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.083
RESOURCE SAYS. AND THEN

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.552
PARTNERING THAT SO NOT ONLY

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.086
WOULD WE CREATE THE EVENT. BUT

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.521
WE WOULD HAVE C. B. I WAS ON THE

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:09.056
GROUND THAT COULD. PROVIDE

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:10.991
TRANSLATION SERVICES GET PEOPLE

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:13.861
TO COME TO THOSE EVENTS. AND THE

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:14.695
ANSWER AND ADDRESS EDUCATION

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.830
QUESTIONS- THAT REALLY HELP TO

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:18.766
GET US. WHERE WE NEEDED TO BE

01:37:18.832 --> 01:37:19.967
AND SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:24.972
SO. MORE TO COME ON THIS. IF I

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:25.739
MAKE ON THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.408
FACT THAT THAT REGION THAT TYPE

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:29.376
OF. COMMUNITY BASED CAMPAIGNS

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.245
THINK WE DO SEE THAT. AS A

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:32.479
REALLY EFFECTIVE MODEL AND ONE

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:34.448
THAT THE STATE DID YOU REPLICATE

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:35.883
WHEN IT CAME TO DOING OUTREACH

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:37.918
AND EDUCATION. AROUND HOPING

01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:38.919
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE WERE

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.588
ROLLING OUT SCENES IN TRYING TO

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:42.523
PARTICULARLY TARGET. COMMUNITIES

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:44.124
WITH THE HIGHEST NEED BUT I

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:45.359
THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.460
WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:47.895
ORGANIZATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:49.830
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:50.564
DESCRIBING FOR MANY YEARS WITH

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:52.266
PUBLIC HEALTH. WHICH IS THAT WE

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:53.901
DON'T INVEST UNTIL WE HAVE A

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:55.803
REALLY SPECIFIC NEED AND CRISIS

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:56.870
AND SO WE DON'T BUILD THAT LONG

01:37:56.937 --> 01:37:57.805
TERM CAPACITY AND

01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:59.773
SUSTAINABILITY. THAT WE REALLY

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.109
NEED TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT ON

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:02.710
SOME OF THESE IMPACTS IN THE

01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:06.847
FIRST PLACE. EXCELLENT POINT

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:08.549
THANK YOU. A IS THAT AT THE IS

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:09.817
NOT TO A DRIVER. YOU COMMENTS

01:38:09.883 --> 01:38:11.452
COMMUNITY. FROM THE- REPORT

01:38:11.518 --> 01:38:12.953
WE'RE RELEASING TODAY THE BRIEF.

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.421
BEGINS TO ADDRESS EXACTLY THOSE

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:16.323
ISSUES BUT BUT MORE DISCUSSION

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:17.157
NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THE

01:38:17.224 --> 01:38:19.360
HOSPITALS- AND ALSO WITH

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:20.928
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.129
PARTICULAR AROUND FOR EXAMPLE

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:23.831
THE IRS APPROVED CATEGORIES FOR

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:25.699
COMMUNITY BENEFIT. AND THEN HAT

01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:58.592
INFECTIOUS DISEASE- INFORMATION

01:39:58.659 --> 01:40:00.761
SYSTEMS THAT WERE SUFFICIENT FOR

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:02.529
ROUTINE ACTIVITIES BUT THEY WERE

01:40:02.596 --> 01:40:04.098
LIMITED IN FUNCTIONALITY. DUE TO

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:05.966
LIMITED RESOURCES AND THE

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:07.835
SYSTEMS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:09.770
THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. THE

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:11.138
DISEASE REPORTING SYSTEM WAS

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:12.506
QUICKLY OVERWHELMED BY THE

01:40:12.573 --> 01:40:14.007
VOLUME OF DATA BEING REPORTED ON

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:15.576
ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:17.711

WE HAD UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:31.458
THOUSAND PER DAY. IN RESPONSE WE

01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:32.559
SET UP A NEW SYSTEM FOR

THESE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS TO

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:54.815
MOVE DATA BETWEEN SYSTEMS. WE

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:56.550
COULD NOT SEND AUTOMATED

MULTIPLE ASSESSMENTS RIGHT NOW

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:48.041
OF OUR ECOSYSTEM AND OUR SYSTEMS

01:45:48.108 --> 01:45:49.376
TO DETERMINE WHERE WE NEED TO

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:51.244
PLACE EMPHASIS ON THAT OVER

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:52.312
ARCHING STRATEGY IT'S A

01:45:52.379 --> 01:45:53.346
FOUNDATIONAL WORK THAT'S BEING

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:56.650
DONE- WE SEE FUTURE STRATEGY

FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:03.824
WHAT SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS AND

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:06.426
SERVICES NEED TO BE MAINTAINED

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:12.833
CONSOLIDATED OUR OUR RE FACTORS. AND AS WE BRING THOSE THINGS

01:46:12.899 --> 01:46:15.001
IN HOUSE DO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY

EFFECTIVE WAY TO BE ABLE TO

01:46:24.911 --> 01:46:25.979
BRING ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.748
TOGETHER. YES SO OUR PLAN IS TO

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.483

THE HUNDRED FORTY POSITIONS. I'M

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:11.184
SORRY YES I BELIEVE SO. OKAY SO

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.419
THE REMAINING OF THE MONEY SO

01:48:12.485 --> 01:48:14.387
OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST US OF A TWO

STRUCTURES THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:26.099
AND THE APPLICATIONS THAT WE

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:27.734
START UP CURRENTLY. THERE ARE

01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:30.136
SOME RESIDUAL COSTS AROUND THOSE

01:48:30.203 --> 01:48:30.904
AND ONGOING COSTS THAT WE NEED

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:32.639
TO MAINTAIN. OKAY SO THOSE

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:33.940
LICENSING COSTS WOULD GO AWAY

01:48:34.007 --> 01:48:35.942
AFTER THIS THIS FIRST YEAR OURS

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:37.377
IT AT THE COST OF PURCHASING AND

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:38.278
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:41.982
LIKE SO THAT YOU KNOW. THAT THAT

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:44.317
. LET'S PLACES YOU DON'T GO AWAY

01:48:44.384 --> 01:48:45.986
SO YEAH I KNOW THIS WOULD GO

01:48:46.052 --> 01:48:47.053
AWAY AND I CAN GET YOU MORE

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.822
INFORMATION ON THAT- IN MORE

01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:50.190
DETAIL IF YOU'D LIKE OKAY FINE

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:52.359
SO IT'S I DO YEAH. I GUESS WHY

WHY UNDERSTANDS HIM WHO'S GOING

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:55.662
FOR TWO AND- TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:56.596
FIVE AND IT GOES DOWN TO SIXTY

01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:58.298
ONE POINT EIGHT. WHAT'S GOING

01:48:58.365 --> 01:49:00.100
FOR WHAT SO SOME OF IT'S OUR

01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:00.934
POSITIONS SOME OF ITS FOR

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:02.969
WHATEVER AND- WHY IT IS

01:49:03.036 --> 01:49:06.640
TEMPORARY VERSES YOU KNOW. THAT

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.909
NIGHT I'M GOING SO. THEN I GUESS

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:09.542
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE AND

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:11.077
BEGIN THIS IS. THIS THIS IS MY-

01:49:11.144 --> 01:49:13.280
FORTUNATELY- EXPERIENCE WITH IT

01:49:13.346 --> 01:49:15.615
PROJECTS IS THAT. SO FOR THESE

01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:17.984
SYSTEMS AND I. YOU KNOW I HEAR A

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:18.818
LOT OF THE OLD MAINTENANCE AND

01:49:18.885 --> 01:49:22.756
SO FORTH- AND IN FACT- ENFORCE

01:49:22.822 --> 01:49:24.824
WE HAVE TOLENTINO THE TECHNOLOGY

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:28.028
FOLKS HERE. BUT R. D. AND I KNOW

01:49:28.094 --> 01:49:29.596
WE STILL THESE UP PRETTY QUICKLY

01:49:29.663 --> 01:49:31.364
FOR THE FOR THE PANDEMIC. BUT ON

01:49:31.431 --> 01:49:33.934
A MORE ON GOING BASIS RD. FOR

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.402
EXAMPLE ALREADY BUILT AS A

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:37.070
MODULAR SYSTEM SO IT'S HARDLY

01:49:37.137 --> 01:49:38.905
MADE SO IT DECIDE FROM THE

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:40.140
MAINTENANCE PART LIKE KEEP IT

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:41.841
RUNNING. WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:43.476
KEEP SYSTEMS UPGRADED RIGHT SO

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:44.711
THEY'RE GOING TO INTERFACE WITH

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:46.513
OTHER SYSTEMS. THERE'S OTHER YOU

01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:47.647
KNOW WHETHER IN HEALTH CARE

01:49:47.714 --> 01:49:49.449
SYSTEM OR OTHER PLACES AND THOSE

01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:51.318
SYSTEMS WILL UPGRADE RATE THAT

01:49:51.384 --> 01:49:52.953
OPERATING SYSTEMS UPGRADE YET

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.354
WINDOWS GET THIS FROM TEN TO

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:56.556
ELEVEN. BACK IOS GOES FROM I

01:49:56.623 --> 01:49:58.325
ONLY GO TO HIGH SIERRA TO YOU

01:49:58.391 --> 01:49:59.559
KNOW LET THIRD OR WHATEVER YOU

01:49:59.626 --> 01:50:01.161
KNOW IF I GOT WRONG. YOU KNOW

01:50:01.227 --> 01:50:04.664
THE MAC AT HOME. SO SO WE SO WE

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:06.299
NOT ONLY NEED MAINTENANCE WE

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:07.567
ALSO NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:09.169
DESIGNED THE SYSTEM IN A WAY

01:50:09.235 --> 01:50:10.837
THAT. IT'S MODULAR AND CAN

01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:11.938
UPGRADE SO THAT WE'RE ALWAYS

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:13.506
WITH DOING MY CALL BIG BANG

01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:15.275
RIGHT LANDS WE- REVIVED BIG

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:16.910
SYSTEM WE GET. SOMEONE AND THEN

01:50:16.977 --> 01:50:18.345
WE PUT IT THERE AND IT SITS

01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:19.646
THERE AND THEN EACH YEAR IT GETS

01:50:19.713 --> 01:50:21.181
OLDER AND OLDER OLDER THAN TEN

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:23.016
YEARS LATER WE HAVE A SITUATION.

01:50:23.083 --> 01:50:24.951
WHERE OUR SYSTEM IS REALLY OLD

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:26.653
AND IT'S NOT KEEPING UP I MEAN.

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:29.389
YOU KNOW WITH. WITH EDT DMV YOU

01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:37.731
KNOW SO. SO I WANT TO BE SURE TO

01:50:37.797 --> 01:50:38.832
IT AS WORK. PENDING FUNDING IN.

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:41.334
AND WE'RE ABOUT. WERE NOT JUST

01:50:41.401 --> 01:50:41.968
TALKING ME IN A WE'RE TALKING.

01:50:42.035 --> 01:50:42.802
ON GOING. UPGRADING BECAUSE IT'S

01:50:42.869 --> 01:50:43.703
NOT KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:44.704
CONSTANT IN- A MONITOR. TO IT

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:46.072
SUITS CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:47.440
THESE ARE NOT JUST. ALONE THEY

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:48.708
HAVE TO INTERFACE THE REST OF

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:50.210
THE WORLD RIGHT SO I HOPE THE-

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:52.012
THE- LIKE THE BROTHERS OF AXING

01:50:52.078 --> 01:50:53.480
REGISTRY OR TO NOTIFIER WHATEVER

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:55.382
ELSE RATES OF WHAT USED TO BE ON

01:50:55.448 --> 01:50:57.217
TRACK FAX TECHNOLOGY USED TO BE.

01:50:57.283 --> 01:50:58.818
A STATE OF THE ART. IT'S NOT

01:50:58.885 --> 01:51:00.353
ANYMORE RIGHT SO YOU DON'T BE

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:01.254
STUCK WITH A SYSTEM THAT

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:03.757
DOESN'T. INVOLVE WITH THE THINGS

01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:05.225
AROUND IT EVEN IF IT WORKS

01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:06.993
REALLY WELL. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.094
WELL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T INTERACT

01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:09.129
WITH OTHER SYSTEMS AROUND

01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:10.263
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THAT KIND.

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.599
COULD HAVE NVOLVED. IN THEIR

01:51:12.665 --> 01:51:14.567
OWN WAY SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:15.802
THAT. EAH I KNOW AND I TOTALLY

01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:17.103
AGREE WITH YOU SO UNFORTUNATELY

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.204
WE HAD TO STAND THESE THINGS UP

01:51:18.271 --> 01:51:19.439
VERY QUICKLY AND RAPIDLY SO WE

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:20.673
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO THE

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.042
STRATEGY ARCHITECTURE AROUND

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:23.743
THOSE. TO BUILD THEM THE MOST

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:25.979
EFFICIENT AND MODULAR WAY- THAT

01:51:26.046 --> 01:51:28.014
IS- THE FUTURE STRATEGIES THAT

01:51:28.081 --> 01:51:29.449
WE'RE LOOKING AT SO WE'RE GOING

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:31.284
TO. WE'RE DOING ASSESSMENTS

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.186
RIGHT NOW ON THE APP FOR

01:51:33.253 --> 01:51:34.287
SUSTAINABILITY. LOOKING AT HOW

01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:35.822
WHAT SYSTEMS CAN BE RATIONALIZED

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:37.757
COMBINED. WITH SYSTEMS NEED

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:38.992
BETTER ARCHITECTURE TO BE MORE

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:40.960
MODULAR. AND HOW WE TRANSITION

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:42.929
OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CLOUD.

01:51:42.996 --> 01:51:44.364
AND ALL THE FEATURES OF THAT

01:51:44.431 --> 01:51:45.832
GOING FORWARD BUT YOU'RE

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:48.034
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THAT'S- YOU

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:49.636
KNOW ONE OF THE MAIN. PRIORITIES

01:51:49.702 --> 01:51:51.571
AS WE SEEK A PHOTO SO WHAT'S THE

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:53.440
TIME SO AND I UNDERSTAND THE

01:51:53.506 --> 01:51:54.774
PREVIOUS YOUR PREVIOUS ANSWER

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:56.743
THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE YOU

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:57.777
KNOW THERE IS THIS THAT WE CAN

01:51:57.844 --> 01:52:05.785
GET THAT CHIEF IT OFFICER. GOING

01:52:05.852 --> 01:52:06.786
TO DO THIS THING WHAT'S THE

01:52:06.853 --> 01:52:08.221
TIMELINE FOR THAT. SO YOU KNOW.

01:52:08.288 --> 01:52:09.055
WE WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING IS

01:52:09.122 --> 01:52:11.357
ASSESSED. TO UNDER. THE AND OF

01:52:11.424 --> 01:52:11.958
F. AND WHAT WE- HAVE- BEFORE

01:52:12.025 --> 01:52:12.859
WHICH DETERMINE THE- STRATEGY.

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:14.961
HOW LONG IS. IT TAKE IT JUST

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:16.196
DEPENDS ON HOW BIG. YOU KNOW I

01:52:16.262 --> 01:52:17.297
GOTTA GET A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

01:52:17.363 --> 01:52:18.932
HAVE TO HAPPEN BUT I WOULD LIKE

01:52:18.998 --> 01:52:20.433
TO HAVE A TIME LINE FOR THE

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:21.835
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS SO HOW LONG

01:52:21.901 --> 01:52:23.269
DID IT TAKE TO DO THAT FIRST

01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:24.437
PART AND THEN YOU CAN BRING AN

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:25.972
I. T. PERSON AND THEN WE'RE

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:26.673
GOING TO SO. I MEAN WE TALKING

01:52:26.739 --> 01:52:28.508
IN. FULL WELL WE HAVE AN IT

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:30.477
STRATEGY IN TWO YEARS THREE

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.445
YEARS. WHAT'S THAT THAT WHAT

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:35.348
WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT- WE

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:37.784
SHOULD HAVE- THAT TV TO BE READY

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:41.387
TO PRESENT. ITS STRATEGY TO US

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:43.389
AND FRANKLY THE REST OF THE

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:46.159
WORLD. IS TOO OKAY- THIS IS THIS

01:52:46.226 --> 01:52:47.527
IS THIS IS THE PATH THIS IS THE

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:48.962
PATH THAT WE'VE GOING THROUGH

01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:54.667
EXTENDED SUCCESS MENTOR CENTER-

01:52:54.734 --> 01:52:56.102
SO WHAT WHAT IS THAT TIME LINE.

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:57.670
I WILL ANTICIPATE IT WOULD TAKE

01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:58.271
THREE YEARS WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:52:58.338 --> 01:53:00.607
MOVE MORE AND ADD JOBS. ALREADY

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:02.609
JEWS OR STRATEGY UNDERSTAND OUR

01:53:02.675 --> 01:53:04.911
ECOSYSTEMS AND THEN DEVELOPED-

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:06.112
THAT STRATEGY AND THEN IMPLEMENT

01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:07.714
GOING FORWARD AND THEN JUST TO

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:09.516
GET HER DEATH. SO IT'S NOT A ONE

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:11.885
TIME STRATEGY. CAN IMPLEMENT IT

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:12.852
AND THIS STOP LIKE YOU'RE SAYING

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:14.521
THAT THAT LEADS TO BIG BANG AT

01:53:14.587 --> 01:53:16.623
LEAST R. K. SYSTEMS AND OUTDATED

01:53:16.689 --> 01:53:18.391
SYSTEMS. WE WANT TO CONTINUALLY

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:19.792
DO STRATEGY AND CONTINUE

01:53:19.859 --> 01:53:21.728
REFRESHER SYSTEMS GOING FORWARD.

01:53:21.794 --> 01:53:23.196
YOU NEED GIVE ME A TIMELINE FOR

01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:24.597
ITS STRATEGY FOR AT LEAST

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:26.699
INITIALLY DOING STRATEGY SO IT.

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:28.902
I WOULD I WOULD SAY AT LEAST ONE

01:53:28.968 --> 01:53:30.069
TO TWO YEARS BEFORE I CAN DO

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:31.738
THAT DEPENDING YOU KNOW AND-

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.107
DON'T QUOTE ME ON IT BUT THAT.

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:34.741
THAT'S NORMALLY ABOUT GENERALLY

01:53:34.807 --> 01:53:36.209
WHAT WE'RE THINKING AND AS TIME.

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:37.443
SO IT'S ONLY JUST BECAUSE THIS

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:38.811
AND MENTALLY I WON'T BE HERE

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:40.847
NEXT YEAR- SO I'M GONNA LOOK AT.

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:42.215
CENTER ADMIN AND SOMEONE ELSE

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:43.149
WILL PERHAPS HERE TO HEALTH

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:44.350
COMMITTEE AND SO FORTH AND ALSO

01:53:44.417 --> 01:53:45.885
TO LOOK AT ELIAHU IT'S NOT ON

01:53:45.952 --> 01:53:48.254
THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW. AND SO I

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:50.423
THINK. ANYTIME WE DO A LARGE IT

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:53.193
STRATEGY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:53:53.259 --> 01:53:55.161
THAT WE DO AN INFORMATIONAL

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:57.430
HEARING. WITH AN UPDATE. THAT

01:53:57.497 --> 01:53:59.065
HAS OF COURSE THE AGENCY THAT'S

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:00.867
DOING IT AND THE PART OF

01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:09.776
TECHNOLOGY AND TALK ABOUT WHERE. YOU KNOW HOW THAT'S COMING

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:11.177
TOGETHER. AS AFTER ALL YOU KNOW

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:12.579
WE- THAT THE THINGS ARE EX.

01:54:12.645 --> 01:54:14.013
STATE AND SO FORTH AND- WHAT I

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:14.914
PREFERRED TO THAT THAN THE

01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:16.416
HEARING THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN WHEN

01:54:16.482 --> 01:54:17.483
WE USED TO GO INTO AGENCY HAS TO

01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:19.319
COME UP AND TELL US HOW. HOW TO

01:54:19.385 --> 01:54:20.853
DETER SYSTEM IS AND WHY THERE'S

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.355
A FAILURE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:54:22.422 --> 01:54:23.823
DON'T THEY CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN.

01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:25.024
AND THAT THAT UNLIMITED DATA

01:54:25.091 --> 01:54:28.828
DATA SYSTEMS. SO SO I THINK IT

01:54:28.895 --> 01:54:30.763
IS IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW UP- MAYBE

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:32.398
ELLIE- CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:33.466
KIND OF MONITORING YOU'LL BE

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.268
DOING OF THESE I THIS I. T.

01:54:35.335 --> 01:54:38.438
EFFORT- TO BE SURE THAT- WE ARE.

01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:39.439
THAT THE LEGISLATURES WILL

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.708
INFORM TO I MEAN I GET. NOW AND

01:54:41.774 --> 01:54:43.076
I APPRECIATE NOW THE AGILE AND

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:48.414
ALL THIS OTHER STUFF. BUT I.

01:54:48.481 --> 01:54:49.882
THINK IT'S AGAIN IMPORTANT WE

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:50.550
MONITOR THIS. SO THAT SAYS THANK

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:53.386
YOU FOR ASKING DR PAN- WE WILL

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:54.954
CONTINUE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT

01:54:55.021 --> 01:54:57.390
ABOUT THIS AND WE ALSO HAVE. ONE

01:54:57.457 --> 01:54:59.292
OF MY COLLEAGUES AND IS.

01:54:59.359 --> 01:55:00.660
SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW

01:55:00.727 --> 01:55:02.395
SPECIFICALLY LOOKS AT IT

01:55:02.462 --> 01:55:04.163
PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:05.898
GOVERNMENT AND MONITORS ALL OF

01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:08.268
THE- VARIOUS PROJECTS GOING

01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:09.535
THROUGH THE- DEPARTMENT OF

01:55:09.602 --> 01:55:11.871
TECHNOLOGY AND THE- PROJECT

01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:18.111
APPROVAL LIFECYCLE. PROCESS- BUT

01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:20.013
YEAH YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE TO

01:55:20.079 --> 01:55:22.148
GIVE THAT SOME SPECIFIC THOUGHT

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:24.183
AS TO JUST SORT OF HOW WE

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:26.319
INTERACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:27.654
MONITOR THIS GOING FORWARD BUT

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.389
IT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT'S

01:55:29.455 --> 01:55:31.557
ON OUR RADAR THAT WILL BE

01:55:31.624 --> 01:55:33.660
CONTINUING TO ASK ABOUT OKAY SO

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:34.661

FROM THE LA- IS THAT SO THE

01:55:40.466 --> 01:55:41.434
REASON I STARTED OFF POINTING

01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:43.403
OUT THAT WE'RE GOING FOR TWO

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:44.203

POINT EIGHT MILLION IS THAT.

01:55:46.839 --> 01:55:48.241
THAT'S A BUDGET TO MAINTAIN THE

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:50.343
CURRENT SYSTEMS THAT'S NOT A

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:51.844

CONSIDERING THAT ON THE I. T.

01:56:08.328 --> 01:56:10.196
SIDE FOR CD PH THERE'S GOING TO

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:12.832
BE AN ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE FOR

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:14.467
NEW SYSTEMS AFTER A

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:16.035

OF COVERT RESPONSE IN A WORD NOW

02:00:57.917 --> 02:01:00.820
APPROACHING OVER EIGHTY THREE

02:01:00.886 --> 02:01:02.021
THOUSAND DEATHS THAT WE'VE HAD

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:03.956
ATTRIBUTED TO COME OVER AND WE

02:01:04.023 --> 02:01:05.725
KNOW THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY

02:01:05.791 --> 02:01:07.960
HAS A MUCH BIGGER RESPONSE

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:09.762
BEYOND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:11.497
HAVE THAT HAVE DIED I HE

02:01:11.564 --> 02:01:14.066
MENTIONED ALSO THAT EARLIER

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:15.401
ACCESS TO ASK. I DON'T THINK I

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:16.902
WANT TO MENTION IS THAT. WITH

02:01:16.969 --> 02:01:18.804
CULTIVATED THERE REALLY HAS

02:01:18.871 --> 02:01:21.707
THERE REALLY HAS BEEN A- SHIFT.

02:01:21.774 --> 02:01:23.576
IN OUR MINDSET OF UNDERSTANDING

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:25.544
HOW THIS PANDEMIC IS PLAYING

02:01:25.611 --> 02:01:27.947
OUT. I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A

02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:29.615
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OVER THE PAST

02:01:29.682 --> 02:01:31.317
TWO YEARS AND ALL OF US CAN GO

02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:33.119
BACK AND THINK ABOUT EVEN IN

02:01:33.185 --> 02:01:35.087
JUNE FIFTEENTH. YOU KNOW WHEN WE

02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:38.424
LIFTED. THE RESTRICTIONS- AND

02:01:38.491 --> 02:01:39.859
THE BLUEPRINTS TO BLUEPRINT FOR

02:01:39.925 --> 02:01:42.028
A BETTER ECONOMY WENT AWAY. YOU

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:43.929
KNOW THERE WERE SOME OPTIMISM

02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:45.431
THAT YOU NEVER HEARD OF MUTINY

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:47.900
WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE WE HAVE

02:01:47.967 --> 02:01:50.102
A LOT OF PEOPLE VACCINATED. AND

02:01:50.169 --> 02:01:52.271
THEN OF COURSE- THINGS CHANGE

02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:54.173
WITH WITH DELTA. AND ONE OF THE

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:55.708
THINGS I DO WANT TO POINT OUT

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:56.776
WITH DELTA THIS WAS TRUE ALSO

02:01:56.842 --> 02:01:59.512
FOR THE ALPHA VARIANT. IS THAT.

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:00.646
THERE ARE NOT ONLY MORE

02:02:00.713 --> 02:02:05.918
TRANSMISSIBLE BUT THEY. WERE

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:07.453
ALSO MORE VIRULENT. AND- ONE OF

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.421
THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THIS

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:10.056
VIRUS MOVING FORWARD IS THAT

02:02:10.122 --> 02:02:11.757
BECAUSE MOST TRANSMISSION

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:13.726
HAPPENS BEFORE PEOPLE DEVELOP

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:15.461
SYMPTOMS. EITHER THEY'RE A

02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:17.630
SYMPTOMATIC DON'T DEVELOP ANY

02:02:17.697 --> 02:02:19.498
SYMPTOMS THAT TRANSMIT. OR THEIR

02:02:19.565 --> 02:02:21.634
PRE SYMPTOMATIC AND CAN TRANSMIT

02:02:21.701 --> 02:02:23.936
BEFORE THEY DEVELOP SYMPTOMS. IT

02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:25.738
TURNS OUT FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY.

02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:27.873
BIOLOGY PERSPECTIVE THAT WE

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.275
COULD HAVE A BEARING ON THE

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.643
FUTURE LIKE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN

02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:32.845
THAT ARE MORE VIRULENT IN OTHER

02:02:32.912 --> 02:02:34.413
WORDS THE COST BECAUSE MORE

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.185
DISEASE. AND. AND CAN BE MORE

02:02:39.251 --> 02:02:40.219
TRANSMISSIBLE. THERE IS A

02:02:40.286 --> 02:02:41.854
NATIONAL THINKING THAT DELTA WE

02:02:41.921 --> 02:02:43.022
WOULD NOT SEE IF WE WOULD NOT

02:02:43.089 --> 02:02:44.090
SEE THINGS MORE TRANSMISSIBLE

02:02:44.156 --> 02:02:45.658
THAN DELTA AND THEN OVER

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:46.892
THANKSGIVING WE LEARNED ABOUT A

02:02:46.959 --> 02:02:49.128
LOW CRIME. SO OVERCROWDED REALLY

02:02:49.195 --> 02:02:50.930
MADE US HAVE A REALLY BIG SHOULD

02:02:50.996 --> 02:02:52.498
SHIFT IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR IN

02:02:52.565 --> 02:02:54.800
OUR THINKING IS THAT BECAUSE WE

02:02:54.867 --> 02:02:55.601
STILL HAVE TRANSMISSION

02:02:55.668 --> 02:02:57.770
HAPPENING GLOBALLY WE ARE GOING

02:02:57.837 --> 02:03:00.339
TO HAVE NEW VARIANTS. WE CANNOT

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:02.775
PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHERE

02:03:02.842 --> 02:03:04.076
WHETHER THAT BUT COMBINATION

02:03:04.143 --> 02:03:05.678
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN TERMS OF

02:03:05.745 --> 02:03:06.812
TRANSFER DEFINITELY PROBABLY

02:03:06.879 --> 02:03:08.280
MORE TRANSMISSIBLE AND MAYBE

02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:10.416
EVEN MORE VIRULENT. AND SO WE

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:12.785
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OUR

02:03:12.852 --> 02:03:14.954
PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:17.323

02:41:33.850 --> 02:41:35.952
HEALTH RESILIENCE PLANS. ON

02:41:36.019 --> 02:41:37.754
DOING SO WOULD ALLOW RESOURCE

02:41:37.821 --> 02:41:39.222
LIMITED HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND

INEQUITABLE HEALTH IMPACTS OF

02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:45.896
CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING THE

02:41:45.962 --> 02:41:48.398
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RISKS. EACH OF

02:41:48.465 --> 02:41:49.833
THE FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER

02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:51.635
REGIONS WOULD BE SUPPORTED TO

02:41:51.701 --> 02:41:53.036
WRITE A CLIMATE CHANGE AND

02:41:53.103 --> 02:41:54.871
HEALTH RESILIENCE PLAN THAT

02:41:54.938 --> 02:41:56.473
WOULD BE COORDINATED I WANTED TO

LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AT THE

02:41:58.241 --> 02:42:00.210
REGIONAL LEVEL- THERE'S A LONG

02:42:00.277 --> 02:42:01.545
LIST OF THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN

02:42:01.611 --> 02:42:03.013
AT THE REGIONAL LOCAL LEVEL THAT

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:04.081
I WON'T GO INTO BUT WE WOULD

TO PRIORITIZE THE COMMUNITIES

02:42:10.487 --> 02:42:12.322
THAT WOULD BE MOST IMPACTED AND

02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:14.758
ENGAGE THEM- IN THIS LOCAL

02:42:14.825 --> 02:42:16.059
PLANNING AND AT THE REGIONAL

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:18.095
LEVEL AND IF RESOURCES

02:42:18.161 --> 02:42:20.497
DEPARTMENT- REGIONAL COALITIONS

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:25.235
COULD BEGIN. PROSPECTS OF

MADAM CHAIR CINEMATIC FROM THE

02:42:35.178 --> 02:42:37.981
LA- WE JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS

02:42:38.048 --> 02:42:40.317
ABOUT EACH OF THE PROPOSALS- ON

02:42:40.383 --> 02:42:42.119
ISSUE NINE THE CLIMATE AND

02:42:42.185 --> 02:42:44.588
HEALTH SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM WE

02:42:44.654 --> 02:42:46.690
WOULD NOTE THAT THIS- PROPOSAL

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:48.458
DOESN'T DRESS- CURRENT GAP IN

02:42:48.525 --> 02:42:50.193
THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO CLIMATE

02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:52.395
CHANGE RELATED- EVENTS AND

02:42:52.462 --> 02:42:55.132
PARTICULARLY THAT THE HEALTH- IN

02:42:55.198 --> 02:42:57.100
IN. MONITORING THE HEALTH

02:42:57.167 --> 02:42:59.236
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE RELATED

02:42:59.302 --> 02:43:01.204
EVENTS IN THE PROPOSAL DOES HAVE

02:43:01.271 --> 02:43:03.673
A NUMBER OF MERITS ONE WE KNOW

02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:04.941
THAT THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF

02:43:05.008 --> 02:43:06.476
CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CONTINUE TO

02:43:06.543 --> 02:43:08.278
GROW PARTICULARLY AS THE NUMBER

02:43:08.345 --> 02:43:13.817
AND SEVERITY OF CLIMATE RELATED

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:15.385
WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE REAL TIME

02:43:15.452 --> 02:43:18.121
ANALYSIS- ALLOWING FOR THE EARLY

02:43:18.188 --> 02:43:20.757
DETECTION OF OUTBREAKS- IT WILL

02:43:20.824 --> 02:43:22.492
ALSO FACILITATE BETTER PLANNING

02:43:22.559 --> 02:43:24.094
BY INCREASING AND UNDERSTANDING

02:43:24.161 --> 02:43:26.096
OF THE MAGNITUDE OF POTENTIAL

02:43:26.163 --> 02:43:28.198
FUTURE MAGNITUDE OF SOME OF THE

02:43:28.265 --> 02:43:31.067
VARIOUS. TYPES OF HEALTH IMPACTS

02:43:31.134 --> 02:43:32.936
FROM CLIMATE RELATED EVENTS AND

02:43:33.003 --> 02:43:34.671
HOW THESE IMPACTS REALLY

02:43:34.738 --> 02:43:38.008
AFFECTS- BOTH DIFFERENT GROUPS

02:43:38.074 --> 02:43:40.110
OF PEOPLE AS WELL AS DIFFERENT

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:42.445
REGIONS- AROUND THE STATE AND

02:43:42.512 --> 02:43:43.914
THEN WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IT

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:46.349
ALLOWS- OR WE HOPE THIS WILL

02:43:46.416 --> 02:43:50.387
ALLOW FOR BETTER EVALUATION- FOR

02:43:50.453 --> 02:43:52.589
EXAMPLE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS

02:43:52.656 --> 02:43:54.257
THE VERY IS DATA COLLECTED WE

02:43:54.324 --> 02:43:56.426
HOPE WOULD FACILITATE A MORE

02:43:56.493 --> 02:43:57.994
ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE

02:43:58.061 --> 02:43:59.763
POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF

02:43:59.829 --> 02:44:01.698
DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS

02:44:01.765 --> 02:44:04.000
THAT ARE TAKEN TO REDUCE. THE

02:44:04.067 --> 02:44:05.001
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

02:44:05.068 --> 02:44:08.205
CHANGE- IN IN SPEAKING WITH THE

02:44:08.271 --> 02:44:11.508
DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL-

02:44:11.575 --> 02:44:12.909
WE WOULD JUST ALSO NOTE THAT

02:44:12.976 --> 02:44:15.078
PARTICIPATION IN THE CDC'S BIO

02:44:15.145 --> 02:44:16.613
SENSE PROGRAM REALLY ENABLES

02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:19.482
CALIFORNIA TO PARTICIPATE IN A

02:44:19.549 --> 02:44:21.251
COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE WITH OTHER

02:44:21.318 --> 02:44:23.186
STATES AND THEN ENGAGE IN

02:44:23.253 --> 02:44:24.955
CALIFORNIA CAN ENGAGE THE LOCAL

02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:26.823
HEALTH JURISDICTIONS IN A STATE

02:44:26.890 --> 02:44:32.862
LEVEL COMMUNITY OF. PRACTICE-

02:44:32.929 --> 02:44:34.030
THE ONE THAT THAT WE WULD RAISE

02:44:34.097 --> 02:44:35.165
WITH THE PROPOSED WHICH IS THIS

02:44:35.232 --> 02:44:36.366
IS A CREEK OF THE PROPOSED

02:44:36.433 --> 02:44:38.034
ITSELF IT'S MORE MORE JUST A

02:44:38.101 --> 02:44:41.538
COMMENT- SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE

02:44:41.605 --> 02:44:43.139
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT MAKES IT

02:44:43.206 --> 02:44:45.141
POSSIBLE TO DETECT ISSUES AND

02:44:45.208 --> 02:44:48.144
OUTBREAKS. EARLY AND DO THAT

02:44:48.211 --> 02:44:49.913
SORT OF REAL TIME ANALYSIS THAT

02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:51.414
WAS DISCUSSED. BUT IT DOESN'T

02:44:51.481 --> 02:44:53.250
NECESSARILY DETERMINE WHAT

02:44:53.316 --> 02:44:55.952
HAPPENS NEXT- BEYOND JUST SORT

02:44:56.019 --> 02:44:58.922
OF NOTIFICATION- SO FOR EXAMPLE

02:44:58.989 --> 02:45:00.156
HOW WILL THIS TO USE THIS

02:45:00.223 --> 02:45:01.891
INFORMATION IN REAL TIME TO

02:45:01.958 --> 02:45:03.526
ACTIVATE A RESPONSE BY THE

02:45:03.593 --> 02:45:05.362
RELEVANT STATE AND LOCAL

02:45:05.428 --> 02:45:08.131
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES- IS AN

02:45:08.198 --> 02:45:10.867
IMPORTANT SHOW- WERE YOU KNOW.

02:45:10.934 --> 02:45:12.102
SORT OF FOLLOW UP QUESTION AND

02:45:12.168 --> 02:45:13.903
IT. I THINK THIS MAKES THIS IS A

02:45:13.970 --> 02:45:15.805
GOOD SEGUE ACTUALLY INTO OUR

02:45:15.872 --> 02:45:20.043
COMMENTS ON THE NEXT PROPOSAL-

02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:21.311
YOU KNOW WHICH REALLY INVOLVES

02:45:21.378 --> 02:45:24.648
THE PLANNING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:45:24.714 --> 02:45:27.150
FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. AND BEFORE I

02:45:27.217 --> 02:45:29.119
GET INTO SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON

02:45:29.185 --> 02:45:30.920
THE PROPOSAL I'M GONNA TAKE THE

02:45:30.987 --> 02:45:32.889
OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE A GENERAL

02:45:32.956 --> 02:45:35.792
POINT ABOUT NOT ONLY THIS.

02:45:35.859 --> 02:45:37.827
PROPOSAL ISSUE NUMBER TEN BUT

02:45:37.894 --> 02:45:39.562
ALSO A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS

02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:41.097
THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:45:41.164 --> 02:45:43.733
PUBLIC HEALTH- BUDGET AND IN

02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:45.235
FACT THE SCHOOL MAYBE REDUCE THE

02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:47.704
NEED HER TO CALL ON THE LA- ON A

02:45:47.771 --> 02:45:50.907
NUMBER OF THE FUTURE- ITEMS- WE

02:45:50.974 --> 02:45:51.975
JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE A

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:53.143
NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE

02:45:53.209 --> 02:45:55.045
BUDGET THIS YEAR THAT REQUEST

02:45:55.111 --> 02:45:57.614
ONE TIME. FUNDING FOR A SPECIFIC

02:45:57.681 --> 02:46:00.183
PURPOSE- SO IT INCLUDES THIS

02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:01.518
PROPOSAL FOR REGIONAL CLIMATE

02:46:01.584 --> 02:46:03.320
PLANNING- THERE'S ANOTHER

02:46:03.386 --> 02:46:06.723
PROPOSAL- FOR BOOKS FOR CHILDREN

02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:09.225
IN THE WICK PROGRAM SH THERE'S

02:46:09.292 --> 02:46:10.760
ONE TO SUPPORT THE FITNESS KEPT

02:46:10.827 --> 02:46:12.929
THE GOVERNOR'S FITNESS COUNCIL.

02:46:12.996 --> 02:46:14.531
AND THERE'S ONE FOR EXAMPLE FOR

02:46:14.597 --> 02:46:18.368
GRANTS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE-

02:46:18.435 --> 02:46:21.204
PILOT PROGRAMS. AND WE WERE OUR

02:46:21.271 --> 02:46:22.706
OFFICE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT ONE

02:46:22.772 --> 02:46:24.574
TIME APPROPRIATIONS MAY MAKE

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:27.010
SENSE THIS YEAR FOR A COUPLE OF

02:46:27.077 --> 02:46:28.144
REASONS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT

02:46:28.211 --> 02:46:29.646
THE STATE DOES HAVE A-

02:46:29.713 --> 02:46:31.247
DISCRETIONARY BUDGET SURPLUS

02:46:31.314 --> 02:46:32.682
THIS YEAR. BUT WE HAVE NO

02:46:32.749 --> 02:46:34.317
GUARANTEE THAT THOSE REVENUES

02:46:34.384 --> 02:46:35.318
ARE GOING TO REMAIN AT THAT

02:46:35.385 --> 02:46:37.787
LEVEL SH SO OUR OFFICE REGULARLY

02:46:37.854 --> 02:46:39.222
CAUTIONS AGAINST- OVER

02:46:39.289 --> 02:46:40.724
COMMITTING FUNDING TO ONGOING

02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:42.592
PROGRAMS DURING GOOD TIMES THAT

02:46:42.659 --> 02:46:44.961
CANNOT REALISTICALLY BE.

02:46:45.028 --> 02:46:47.797
SUSTAINED DURING DOWNTURNS- IT

02:46:47.864 --> 02:46:52.068
ALSO MAKES SENSE TO DO ONE TIME-

02:46:52.135 --> 02:46:53.903
I DO HAVE ONE TIME AUGMENTATIONS

02:46:53.970 --> 02:46:55.372
WANTED APARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE

02:46:55.438 --> 02:46:57.073
WANTS TO TEST OUT A PROGRAM ON A

02:46:57.140 --> 02:46:59.042
LIMITED BASIS TO SEE IF IT WOULD

02:46:59.109 --> 02:47:00.844
BRING VALUE SH- SUCH AS

02:47:00.910 --> 02:47:02.812
REDUCING- AND NEGATIVE HEALTH

02:47:02.879 --> 02:47:05.181
IMPACT- HEALTH DISPARITY OR TO

02:47:05.248 --> 02:47:07.283
IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. SH

02:47:07.350 --> 02:47:08.752
HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT WAS

02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:10.420
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

02:47:10.487 --> 02:47:12.122
HEALTH SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THE

02:47:12.188 --> 02:47:14.524
HISTORIC CHALLENGES IN THIS

02:47:14.591 --> 02:47:16.626
DEPARTMENT IS THE FACT THAT A

02:47:16.693 --> 02:47:22.432
LOT OF THE FUNDING.IS PROVIDED

02:47:22.499 --> 02:47:22.999
ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR I'M

02:47:23.066 --> 02:47:24.067
SPECIFIC PURPOSE. AND THEN WHEN

02:47:24.134 --> 02:47:25.735
THE FOR GOES AWAY THE STAR OF-

02:47:25.802 --> 02:47:27.604
EXTRA- THE VAL THAT THAT PROGRAM

02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:29.973
BROUGHT- CAN ALSO SOMETIMES GO

02:47:30.039 --> 02:47:32.509
AWAY. SO WE WOULD JUST SUGGEST

02:47:32.575 --> 02:47:34.444
MAKING SURE THAT- THE ONE TIME

02:47:34.511 --> 02:47:36.045
FUNDING FOR ALL OF THESE

02:47:36.112 --> 02:47:37.280
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:47:37.347 --> 02:47:40.784
BEING PROPOSED THIS YEAR SORT OF

02:47:40.850 --> 02:47:42.719
- MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO LEVERAGE

02:47:42.786 --> 02:47:44.754
KIND OF EXISTING RESOURCES IN

02:47:44.821 --> 02:47:46.956
THE FUTURE. OR OR LAY A

02:47:47.023 --> 02:47:49.926
FOUNDATION HAT CAN BE- ACTED

02:47:49.993 --> 02:47:51.928
UPON- IN THE FUTURE WITH AN

02:47:51.995 --> 02:47:56.366
EXISTING- RESOURCES. ON THIS

02:47:56.433 --> 02:47:58.134
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL SORRY FOR

02:47:58.201 --> 02:47:59.903
THE LONG WINDED- SORT OF

02:47:59.969 --> 02:48:01.271
COMMENTARY ABOUT ONE TIME

02:48:01.337 --> 02:48:03.239
PROPOSALS BUT- ON THIS

02:48:03.306 --> 02:48:05.241
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE THINK IT

02:48:05.308 --> 02:48:07.544
HAS A LOT OF MARRIAGE WE ARE

02:48:07.610 --> 02:48:09.078
AWARE OF THE FACT THAT MANY

02:48:09.145 --> 02:48:11.047
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. DO NOT

02:48:11.114 --> 02:48:12.816
CURRENTLY HAVE THE STAFFER

02:48:12.882 --> 02:48:15.251
EXPERTISE TO CONDUCT- PLANNING

02:48:15.318 --> 02:48:17.420
RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I'M A

02:48:17.487 --> 02:48:19.222
COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT THE

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:20.523
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH TO

02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:23.092
CONSIDER OR ASK THE

02:48:23.159 --> 02:48:26.796
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT- WHAT ARE

02:48:26.863 --> 02:48:28.298
THE POTENTIAL DRAWBACKS OF

02:48:28.364 --> 02:48:31.367
HAVING THESE PLANS WILL BE

02:48:31.434 --> 02:48:34.103
CREATED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL-

02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:35.905
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME

02:48:35.972 --> 02:48:37.640
BENEFITS TO HAVING A REGIONAL

02:48:37.707 --> 02:48:39.142
REGIONAL PLANNING IN PLACE

02:48:39.209 --> 02:48:40.810
PARTICULARLY FOR AN ISSUE LIKE

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:42.879
CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH DOES NOT

02:48:42.946 --> 02:48:46.015
RESPECT COUNTY BORDERS- HOWEVER

02:48:46.082 --> 02:48:47.650
THIS PROPOSAL ONLY INCLUDES

02:48:47.717 --> 02:48:49.285
FUNDING FOR CERTAIN COUNTIES

02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:50.587
EVEN THOUGH THE PLANNING WILL BE

02:48:50.653 --> 02:48:52.288
DONE AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. AND

02:48:52.355 --> 02:48:54.958
OUR CONCERN IS- JUST ABOUT

02:48:55.024 --> 02:48:57.293
ENGAGEMENT BY THE OTHER LOCAL

02:48:57.360 --> 02:48:59.462
HEALTH JURISDICTIONS WHO- WHO DO

02:48:59.529 --> 02:49:00.864
NOT HAVE THE FUNDING TO

02:49:00.930 --> 02:49:02.398
PARTICIPATE IN WHETHER THEY'LL

02:49:02.465 --> 02:49:03.633
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FULLY

02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:05.869
ENGAGE. AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE

02:49:05.935 --> 02:49:07.537
THAT WEWOULD RAISE IS IT'S JUST

02:49:07.604 --> 02:49:09.839
HARD TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN

02:49:09.906 --> 02:49:12.408
AFTER THESE PLANS ARE IN PLACE-

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:14.344
WILL WILL THE LOCAL HEALTH

02:49:14.410 --> 02:49:15.912
JURISDICTIONS ACTUALLY BE ABLE

02:49:15.979 --> 02:49:17.914
TO IMPLEMENT THESE PLANS IF THEY

02:49:17.981 --> 02:49:21.184
DON'T HAVE. THE RESOURCES

HAPPENS AND THEN A COUPLE YEARS

02:49:42.672 --> 02:49:44.407
LATER IT GOES AWAY AND EVERYONE

02:49:44.474 --> 02:49:47.810

I LOST FRIENDS LAST YEAR WHO.

02:49:56.085 --> 02:49:58.154
HAD BEEN LIVING WITH HIV AIDS

02:49:58.221 --> 02:49:59.622
AND SHE WAS PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE

02:49:59.689 --> 02:50:01.558
AND HE JUST DIED THIS YEAR AT

02:50:01.624 --> 02:50:02.525
SIXTY SO WE KNOW THE WORK IS

02:50:02.592 --> 02:50:04.861
GOOD AND IMPORTANT- AND I WOULD

02:50:04.928 --> 02:50:07.797
SAY ON THE CLIMATE A MINUTE I'M

02:50:07.864 --> 02:50:09.532
GLAD ON ISSUE NUMBER NINE IT

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:12.435
LOOKS LIKE THAT WE HAVE. WE CAN

02:50:12.502 --> 02:50:13.670
JUST. USUALLY WE DON'T HAVE TO

02:50:13.736 --> 02:50:14.671
RECREATE SOMETHING FROM THE

02:50:14.737 --> 02:50:16.339
WHEEL IS AT THAT AS I UNDERSTAND

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:17.640
IT WE'RE GONNA. BRING TO

02:50:17.707 --> 02:50:19.042
PARTICIPATE WITH THE NATIONAL

02:50:19.108 --> 02:50:20.843
MODEL TO BE ABLE TO SET

02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:22.545
SOMETHING UP. AND I GUESS MY

02:50:22.612 --> 02:50:24.180
QUESTION IS. DO WE HAVE THE

02:50:24.247 --> 02:50:25.915
TECHNOLOGY ALREADY AVAILABLE TO

02:50:25.982 --> 02:50:27.383
BE ABLE TO. AS WE'VE TALKED A

02:50:27.450 --> 02:50:29.385
LOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. TO BE ABLE

02:50:29.452 --> 02:50:30.653
TO PRETTY SEAMLESSLY. PUT THAT

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:33.323
IN PLACE NOW IS MY QUESTION ON

02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:35.391
ISSUE NUMBER NINE. YEAH THANK

02:50:35.458 --> 02:50:36.726
YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I'LL

02:50:36.793 --> 02:50:38.094
BRIEFLY ADDRESS MISS PATRICK'S

02:50:38.161 --> 02:50:41.331
COMMENTS AS WELL SO- CURRENTLY

02:50:41.397 --> 02:50:43.566
THERE ARE. EIGHTEEN COUNTIES

02:50:43.633 --> 02:50:45.201
THAT HAD AT LEAST ONE FACILITY

02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:48.071
THAT IS PARTICIPATING. IN THIS-

02:50:48.137 --> 02:50:50.106
BUT- TO MAKE IT REALLY SPREAD

02:50:50.173 --> 02:50:52.508
ACROSS THE STATE TEN THE- THREE

02:50:52.575 --> 02:50:53.810
HUNDRED AND TWENTY EMERGENCY

02:50:53.876 --> 02:50:54.677
DEPARTMENT FACILITIES AND

02:50:54.744 --> 02:50:55.612
THERE'S OTHER TYPES OF

02:50:55.678 --> 02:50:57.213
FACILITIES AS WELL- BERTHING

02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:59.882
FACILITIES- AND OTHERS THAT IT

02:50:59.949 --> 02:51:01.751
WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT

02:51:01.818 --> 02:51:02.819
FOR THE INCENTIVES IN THE

02:51:02.885 --> 02:51:04.654
TRAINING IN THE ONBOARDING. BUT

02:51:04.721 --> 02:51:06.022
THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD

02:51:06.089 --> 02:51:08.091
SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE. ARE

02:51:08.157 --> 02:51:09.826
ADEQUATE- IT'S JUST

02:51:09.892 --> 02:51:12.428
INCENTIVIZING. LOCAL EMERGENCY

02:51:12.495 --> 02:51:14.897
DEPARTMENTS TO GO THE NEXT STEP-

02:51:14.964 --> 02:51:15.531
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:51:15.598 --> 02:51:17.367
MODERNIZATION OF THE CDC

02:51:17.433 --> 02:51:19.102
BIOSENSOR PLATFORM SO IT'S MORE

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:21.104
USER FRIENDLY WAS DESIGNED FOR.

02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:22.839
BIOTERRORISM BACK IN TWO

02:51:22.905 --> 02:51:24.507
THOUSAND AND THREE. AND TWO

02:51:24.574 --> 02:51:26.275
THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WENT

02:51:26.342 --> 02:51:27.276
THROUGH A LOT OF UPGRADES- AND

02:51:27.343 --> 02:51:29.312
SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TAT

02:51:29.379 --> 02:51:31.614
TAT TAT SPREAD THIS FURTHER. ON

02:51:31.681 --> 02:51:32.782
BUT TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS MISS

02:51:32.849 --> 02:51:34.617
PANICS POINT ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:51:34.684 --> 02:51:37.453
DRAWBACKS- WE WOULD AGREE THAT

02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:39.222
REGIONAL IS A GOOD PLACE TO

02:51:39.288 --> 02:51:40.857
START IT'S NECESSARY BUT NOT

02:51:40.923 --> 02:51:43.126
SUFFICIENT. ALL SIXTY ONE LOCAL

02:51:43.192 --> 02:51:45.294
HEALTH JURISDICTIONS HAVE. ON

02:51:45.361 --> 02:51:47.296
THEIR OWN GENERAL PLANS HAZARD

02:51:47.363 --> 02:51:49.198
MITIGATION PLANS CLIMATE ACTION

02:51:49.265 --> 02:51:52.235
PLANS. AND FUNDING PERMITTED- IT

02:51:52.301 --> 02:51:54.203
WOULD BE IDEAL TO NOT JUST DO

02:51:54.270 --> 02:51:55.538
THIS PLANNING AT THE REGIONAL

02:51:55.605 --> 02:51:57.573
LEVEL BUT- AT ALL OF THE LOCAL

02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:59.075
LEVEL SINCE THAT THREAT WILL

02:51:59.142 --> 02:52:01.444
AFFECT ALL CALIFORNIANS- WEEK

02:52:01.511 --> 02:52:02.745
KNOWLEDGE THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE

02:52:02.812 --> 02:52:04.180
IS NOT A ONE TIME ISSUE HAS

02:52:04.247 --> 02:52:05.381
MENTIONED IT WILL INCREASE IN

02:52:05.448 --> 02:52:08.551
SCOPE SEVERITY. AND SCALE- AND

02:52:08.618 --> 02:52:11.521
SO- PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL WE

02:52:11.587 --> 02:52:12.789
HAVE TO DO THAT BUT FUNDING

02:52:12.855 --> 02:52:14.490
PERMITTING A WOULD DETERMINE HOW

02:52:14.557 --> 02:52:20.063
MUCH WE'RE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT.

02:52:20.129 --> 02:52:20.630
ASPECTS OF THOSE PLANS GOING

02:52:20.697 --> 02:52:22.131
INTO THE FUTURE. THE YOU AND IF

02:52:22.198 --> 02:52:22.799
YOU GET ALL RESPOND TO. MISTAKES

02:52:22.865 --> 02:52:23.900
BECAUSE WHICH IS WHEN I ABOUT

02:52:23.966 --> 02:52:26.069
AFTER WE- AFTER IF WE CAN IF WE

02:52:26.135 --> 02:52:28.371
COULD PREDICT THINGS. OR OR IF

02:52:28.438 --> 02:52:30.606
WE CAN EARLIER- IDENTIFY THINGS

02:52:30.673 --> 02:52:33.109
BUT THEN ARE WE ALSO GOING TO BE

02:52:33.176 --> 02:52:33.710
ABLE TO MEDICATE AND I'M

02:52:33.776 --> 02:52:35.478
THINKING OF I LIVE IN A- AT THE

02:52:35.545 --> 02:52:37.213
END IN THE AREA AND IN THE DELTA

02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:38.514
WHERE WHEN IT GETS VERY HOT AND

02:52:38.581 --> 02:52:39.949
THE WATER FLOW DOESN'T FLOW R.

02:52:40.016 --> 02:52:41.484
BAR WATERS IN STREAMS GET FILLED

02:52:41.551 --> 02:52:43.653
UP WITH. ALGAE THAT IS TOXIC AND

02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:45.455
POISONOUS. AND SO THE

02:52:45.521 --> 02:52:46.723
ANNOUNCEMENT JUST EVERYONE STAY

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:47.790
OUT OF THE WATER BUT THAT'S NOT

02:52:47.857 --> 02:52:49.425
ALWAYS POSSIBLE SO WELL THEY'RE

02:52:49.492 --> 02:52:51.761
ALSO THEN BE IT FOLLOW UP WITH

02:52:51.828 --> 02:52:53.296
MEDICATION AND INTERVENTION AND

02:52:53.362 --> 02:52:55.398
BEST. PRACTICES WE WERE ABLE TO

02:52:55.465 --> 02:52:58.835
PREDICT. SOMETHING SOMETHING BAD

02:52:58.901 --> 02:53:00.470
IS GETTING READY TO HAPPEN. YEAH

02:53:00.536 --> 02:53:01.471
ABSOLUTELY AND YOU'RE REALLY

02:53:01.537 --> 02:53:03.806
REFERENCING- THE PILLARS THAT

02:53:03.873 --> 02:53:05.141
DIRECTOR OUTGOING MENTIONED

02:53:05.208 --> 02:53:06.809
WHICH IS REALLY AIMING TOWARDS

02:53:06.876 --> 02:53:07.777
PREVENTION RIGHT WE DON'T WANT

02:53:07.844 --> 02:53:10.880
TO JUST. COUNT HARM CALIFORNIANS

02:53:10.947 --> 02:53:11.881
FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

02:53:11.948 --> 02:53:13.015
CHANGE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

02:53:13.082 --> 02:53:14.250
PREDICT IT MITIGATED AND

02:53:14.317 --> 02:53:15.718
ULTIMATELY. PREVENTED THAT

02:53:15.785 --> 02:53:17.920
FOURTH PILLAR. SO GIVE YOU ONE

02:53:17.987 --> 02:53:19.355
EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO HEAT.

02:53:19.422 --> 02:53:20.757
RIGHT NOW WHEN WE ISSUE A HEAT

02:53:20.823 --> 02:53:22.992
WARNING. THAT'S BASED ON A VERY

02:53:23.059 --> 02:53:25.461
NON PRECISE HISTORIC TEMPERATURE

02:53:25.528 --> 02:53:27.630
AVERAGES IT HAS NO RELATIONSHIP

02:53:27.697 --> 02:53:29.732
TO HUMAN HEALTH. FOR ABLE TO

02:53:29.799 --> 02:53:32.769
BETTER QUANTIFY. IN A MICRO

02:53:32.835 --> 02:53:34.871
CLIMATE REGION WHEN A PARTICULAR

02:53:34.937 --> 02:53:37.273
TEMPERATURE THRESHOLD AFFECTS A

02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:38.975
PARTICULAR VULNERABLE COMMUNITY.

02:53:39.041 --> 02:53:41.677
THEN WE CAN HAVE. HEALTH RELATED

02:53:41.744 --> 02:53:42.945
HEAT WARNINGS WORK WITH THE

02:53:43.012 --> 02:53:44.981
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. BE

02:53:45.047 --> 02:53:46.783
MORE PROACTIVE AND THAT'S JUST

02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:48.151
ON THE FRONT YOU MENTIONED TOXIC

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:50.186
ALGAE BLOOMS. AND THERE'S MANY

02:53:50.253 --> 02:53:52.288
OTHER AS I MENTIONED WATER FOOD

02:53:52.355 --> 02:53:55.258
AIR FUNGAL BORN SH- CONDITIONS

02:53:55.324 --> 02:53:56.859
THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO NOT

02:53:56.926 --> 02:53:58.795
JUST COUNT REAL TIME. BUT

02:53:58.861 --> 02:54:01.764
ULTIMATELY- PROJECT AS WELL AS

02:54:01.831 --> 02:54:04.033
MEDICAID SO. SOME OF THE STAFF

02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:05.535
BEING PROPOSED IN THIS

02:54:05.601 --> 02:54:07.870
INITIATIVE. INCLUDES FOR THE

02:54:07.937 --> 02:54:10.339
MODELING AND THE COMMUNICATION.

02:54:10.406 --> 02:54:11.674
AND THE LEARNING THAT COMES FROM

02:54:11.741 --> 02:54:13.910
THE REAL TIME INFORMATION- JUST

02:54:13.976 --> 02:54:15.111
LIKE WITH CODING YOUKNOW

02:54:15.178 --> 02:54:16.913
HAVING. SEQUENCING FOR THEIR-

02:54:16.979 --> 02:54:18.548
NEWEST VARIANT ALLOWS US TO BE

02:54:18.614 --> 02:54:20.183
MORE RESPONSIVE TO MITIGATE. THE

02:54:20.249 --> 02:54:24.387
SAME WOULD BE. TRUE FOR CLIMATE

02:54:24.453 --> 02:54:25.021
THREATS MOVING INTO THE FUTURE.

02:54:25.087 --> 02:54:26.556
THANK YOU AND I GUESS IT'S FUNNY

02:54:26.622 --> 02:54:27.623
I WOULD I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

02:54:27.690 --> 02:54:29.025
AS WE'RE DEVELOPING THESE NEW

02:54:29.091 --> 02:54:29.859
REGIONAL PLANS I WOULD HOPE THAT

02:54:29.926 --> 02:54:31.294
WE WOULD USE INFORMATION ALREADY

02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:33.629
AVAILABLE- THERE'S- YOU KNOW.

02:54:33.696 --> 02:54:37.166
MEMBERS PASAL LOT OF BILLS THAT

02:54:37.233 --> 02:54:37.867
BECAUSE ANIMALS REALLY RIGHT I

02:54:37.934 --> 02:54:40.469
THINK WITH THAT. I WAS FROM

02:54:40.536 --> 02:54:42.638
822-000-1718 I THINK A B. SIX

02:54:42.705 --> 02:54:44.173
SEVENTEEN. I MISS GARCIA

02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:46.542
PRESIDENT HAS A GROUP SET UP ALL

02:54:46.609 --> 02:54:47.977
OVER THE STATE COMMUNITY GROUPS

02:54:48.044 --> 02:54:49.478
ARE LOOKING AT AIR QUALITY AND

02:54:49.545 --> 02:54:52.448
ISSUES LIKE THAT SO. JUST MAKE

02:54:52.515 --> 02:54:54.050
SURE WE DON'T. THAT WE TAKE INTO

02:54:54.116 --> 02:54:55.384
ACCOUNT ALL OF THE TASK FORCE

02:54:55.451 --> 02:54:56.552
AND COMMISSIONS AND EVERYTHING

02:54:56.619 --> 02:54:58.054
IS ALREADY SET UP OUT THERE.

02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:59.555
COLLECTING A LOT OF THIS DATA

02:54:59.622 --> 02:55:02.191
AND THAT WE'RE ABLE TO JUST- NOT

02:55:02.258 --> 02:55:03.526
NOT. NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL BUT

02:55:03.593 --> 02:55:04.894
BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THE

02:55:04.961 --> 02:55:05.728
INFORMATION THAT IS ALREADY

02:55:05.795 --> 02:55:07.330
BEING GATHERED. AND MAKE SURE

02:55:07.396 --> 02:55:08.297
THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT WE

02:55:08.364 --> 02:55:10.600
APPRECIATE THE INPUT THAT

02:55:10.666 --> 02:55:11.601
THEY'VE ALREADY GIVEN ON A LOT

02:55:11.667 --> 02:55:13.069
OF THESE TOPICS. ABSOLUTELY AND

02:55:13.135 --> 02:55:15.238
I'LL SAY OF ALL THE PLANS THAT

02:55:15.304 --> 02:55:16.672
EXIST WHAT'S OFTEN MISSING IS

02:55:16.739 --> 02:55:18.574
THE WORD HELP. THERE'S HAZARD

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:20.343
MITIGATION PLANS THERE'S-

02:55:20.409 --> 02:55:21.944
GENERAL PLAN UPDATES LOOKING AT

02:55:22.011 --> 02:55:25.181
CODE AND TRENDS- THERE IS. MORE

02:55:25.248 --> 02:55:27.383
BROADER PLANS LIKE SP ONE

02:55:27.450 --> 02:55:29.151
THOUSAND- THAT FOCUSES ON

02:55:29.218 --> 02:55:30.653
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:32.622
BUT- WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:34.257
CENTER NOW AS AS THE U. N.

02:55:34.323 --> 02:55:36.192
SECRETARY GENERAL ISSUED A- CODE

02:55:36.259 --> 02:55:38.160
RED FOR HUMANITY WERE CALLING A

02:55:38.227 --> 02:55:40.296
CODE BLUE. ABOUT THE HEALTH

02:55:40.363 --> 02:55:42.498
IMPACTS. AND REALLY PULLING ALL

OF VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE

03:16:36.417 --> 03:16:39.387
OCCURRING IN LGBTQ POPULATION.

03:16:39.454 --> 03:16:41.489
BUT AGAIN ALSO AND SOME OF THE

03:16:41.556 --> 03:16:43.892
EARLIER AREAS WE TALKED ABOUT TO

03:16:43.958 --> 03:16:46.127
BE ABLE TO BE MORE- PREDICTABLE

03:16:46.194 --> 03:16:48.263
SURVEILLANCE- AND SO HOPEFULLY

03:16:48.329 --> 03:16:50.932
WE CAN- INTEGRATE THE CHARGE

03:16:50.999 --> 03:16:52.800
SHEET INFORMATION AND SOME OF

03:16:52.867 --> 03:16:56.704
THOSE EARLIER. FACTORS AS WELL.

03:16:56.771 --> 03:16:59.807
DR THANK YOU AND I DO RECENTLY-

03:16:59.874 --> 03:17:00.742
THE WORKED ON HIM BUT I THINK

03:17:00.808 --> 03:17:02.477
IT'S THE CHAIRS MENTIONED WE'VE

03:17:02.544 --> 03:17:04.479
HAD A CHRONIC. CHRONIC PROBLEM

03:17:04.546 --> 03:17:06.714
IS EVEN UNDERSTATEMENT. A REALLY

03:17:06.781 --> 03:17:09.117
SEVERE PROBLEM WHERE- WE DON'T

03:17:09.184 --> 03:17:10.952
HAVE DATA ON THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY

03:17:11.019 --> 03:17:12.353
BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEING COLLECTED

03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:14.489
AND I'LL SAY THAT PART OF THE

03:17:14.556 --> 03:17:15.723
FAULT OF MY OWN PROFESSION RIGHT

03:17:15.790 --> 03:17:16.691
WE THOUGHT THE DEATH

03:17:16.758 --> 03:17:19.260
CERTIFICATES AND- AND- IT'S NOT

03:17:19.327 --> 03:17:20.595
ALWAYS EASY TO ASK THAT

03:17:20.662 --> 03:17:23.064
QUESTION- AND SO. IT DOESN'T GET

03:17:23.131 --> 03:17:24.732
ASKED SO NOTHING GETS ENTERED SO

03:17:24.799 --> 03:17:26.868
I DO APPRECIATE THAT UNDER THIS

03:17:26.935 --> 03:17:28.169
PROPOSAL YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING

03:17:28.236 --> 03:17:30.004
TO. REACH OUT TO THE CORNERS

03:17:30.071 --> 03:17:35.476
MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND. DO YOU

03:17:35.543 --> 03:17:37.345
KNOW HOW YOU GET THERE YOU'LL BE

03:17:37.412 --> 03:17:39.914
MONITORING TO THE RATE OF DATA

03:17:39.981 --> 03:17:41.049
COLLECTION I MEAN THAT THAT'S

03:17:41.115 --> 03:17:42.483
REALLY THE INVITE SO IF IT'S NOT

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:43.751
IT'S NOT ONCE ASKING A QUESTION

03:17:43.818 --> 03:17:44.719
IT DOESN'T GET INTO THE

03:17:44.786 --> 03:17:47.322
DATABASE. SO DO YOU SPEAK TO

03:17:47.388 --> 03:17:49.190
WHAT THE STRATEGIES ARE TWO.

03:17:49.257 --> 03:17:53.361
INCH TO RAISE THE- THE RATE OF

03:17:53.428 --> 03:17:54.729
DATA COLLECTION OF THIS VERY

03:17:54.796 --> 03:17:56.965
IMPORTANT FIELD- THAT- IS THE

03:17:57.031 --> 03:17:58.333
PERSONALITY OR THE WHAT THE

03:17:58.399 --> 03:17:59.500
SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER

I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE PILOTS

03:18:05.873 --> 03:18:07.275
ALL ABOUT. MAKING SPEAK MAYBE A

03:18:07.342 --> 03:18:09.811

03:18:21.456 --> 03:18:22.857
IN. THE GENERATE AND OR SEXUAL

03:18:22.924 --> 03:18:24.425

ONE. BUDGET ACT. WE HAVE A

03:27:00.341 --> 03:27:03.010
TECHNICAL QUESTION AND- IF I

03:27:03.077 --> 03:27:06.514
BURST IN GARB WE HAVE A BIG BONE

03:27:06.580 --> 03:27:09.049
WHAT WE DECREASE THE COST CENTER

03:27:09.116 --> 03:27:10.851
. WELL OUR OUR OUR EXPENDITURES

03:27:10.918 --> 03:27:12.153
WILL ALSO INCREASE AT THE SAME

03:27:12.219 --> 03:27:13.621
TIME BUT WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER

03:27:13.687 --> 03:27:15.823
LOOK AT THAT- IF WE DO HAVE A

03:27:15.890 --> 03:27:18.926
TWO BEDROOM. THANK YOU DOCTOR.

03:27:18.993 --> 03:27:20.628
NOT A BIT WELL THE

03:27:20.694 --> 03:27:21.796
UNDERSTANDABLE CERTAIN FIXED

03:27:21.862 --> 03:27:23.430
COSTS RIGHT SO THE BIRTH RATE

03:27:23.497 --> 03:27:25.399
GOES DOWN THE STREET FOR THE

03:27:25.466 --> 03:27:28.135
FIXED COSTS AND RAISE THE PER

03:27:28.202 --> 03:27:30.371
UNIT COSTS SO THE PER UNIT

03:27:30.437 --> 03:27:31.806
BECAUSE WE DID HAVE A BIG BOOM

03:27:31.872 --> 03:27:33.007
THEN THE PER UNIT COST WOULD

03:27:33.073 --> 03:27:35.009
DROP THE VX TOTAL EXPENDITURE GO

03:27:35.075 --> 03:27:37.044
UP IF MORE CASES BUT THE FIXED

03:27:37.111 --> 03:27:40.114
COSTS REMAIN THE SAME SO ANYWAY-

03:27:40.181 --> 03:27:41.482

03:27:41.549 --> 03:27:44.318
BIG BOOM COMING YET SO- BUT I

03:27:44.385 --> 03:27:46.153
GUESS THE I GUESS THE- LONG TERM

03:27:46.220 --> 03:27:47.521
QUESTION WE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO

03:27:47.588 --> 03:27:48.856
AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW IS THAT

03:27:48.923 --> 03:27:49.590
THERE ARE THERE ANY

03:27:49.657 --> 03:27:54.361
OPPORTUNITIES IF. WE HAVE TO

MITIGATE FUTURE FEE INCREASES

03:28:07.274 --> 03:28:08.609

OPERATIONS IN TERMS OF FIXED

03:28:11.245 --> 03:28:13.214
COSTS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME

03:28:13.280 --> 03:28:13.747

TAKING OUT THE COUNTY FUND SO WE

04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:29.220
MAKING UP THE DEFICIT AND THE

04:14:50.575 --> 04:14:52.543

DIFFERENT PROGRAMS I THINK WHAT

04:14:59.484 --> 04:15:01.119
WE DISCOVERED IS THAT. THERE

04:15:01.185 --> 04:15:02.487
WERE TIMES WHERE STAFF WERE

04:15:02.553 --> 04:15:04.188
ASSIGNED TO ONE PROGRAM BUT THEY

04:15:04.255 --> 04:15:04.722
WERE ASSISTING WITH OTHER

04:15:04.789 --> 04:15:08.493
PROGRAMS. AND AT THAT TIME THE-

04:15:08.559 --> 04:15:11.062
SYSTEM BACK WE HAD IMPLEMENTED

04:15:11.129 --> 04:15:13.865

MORE ROBUST- TIME ACCOUNTING

04:15:23.841 --> 04:15:26.077

04:15:26.144 --> 04:15:28.479
DO YOU IS IT A FRAMEWORK- THAT

04:15:28.546 --> 04:15:30.682
