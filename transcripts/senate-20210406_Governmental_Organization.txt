OKAY NOW LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR CENTER MCGUIRE YOU MAY BEGIN WITH FILE NUMBER ONE. SB THREE FORTY ONE. MORNING. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING TO BE HERE TODAY GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR- THE CHAIR HAS BEEN- COLLABORATIVE AS WE MOVED FORWARD ON THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU TO YOU IN YOUR FANTASTIC STAFF. FOR THE DELIBERATION AND DISCUSSION RELATING TO THIS BILL I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALONG WITH SENATORS GLAZER NIELSEN FOR THE PARTNERSHIP LAST COUPLE OFFICE. I'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT MISTER CHAIR AND HERE'S WHAT THREE FORTY ONE DOES. NUMBER ONE IT PROVIDES UP THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO CREATE BACKUP POWER RULES FOR CELL TOWERS. LAND MINE OPERATIONS IN CABLE PHONE SYSTEMS NUMBER TWO IT MANDATES THE STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES SHARES THE INFORMATION THAT THEY ALREADY RECEIVE FROM TELECOM COMPANIES ON OUTAGES. TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE REASON WHY IN THIS BILL THAT SAT AND WHY THE STATE IS CRITICAL THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHO OVERSEES TELECOMS. AND CREATES POLICY FOR TELECOMS DOESN'T HAVE THE STATUTORY ABILITY TO SEE THIS INFORMATION CURRENTLY. IN THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT DURING TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PLAN POWER OUTAGE TO BUCKLE AT ITS PEAK NEARLY TWO MILLION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ADELINE NINES LANDLINE. CELL PHONE AND CABLE SERVICE INTERRUPTED IN THE OUR PHONES OUR PHONES NOW ARE A LIFELINE TO TELL WE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND HOW WE RECEIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS. YET UP UNTIL LAST YEAR OUR CURRENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM IS A MANDATED TO HAVE A BACKUP POWER AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE CENTER GLAZER FOR HIS WORK. ON THAT- THROUGHOUT THESE CHALLENGING EVENTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO MAKE SURE OUR TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE ARE MORE RESILIENT. AND THAT WE KNOW WHEN THEY ARE WORKING BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WHEN THEY ARE NOT. THE CPC HAS RECENTLY ADOPTED DECISIONS WIRELESS IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY WIRELINE FEBRUARY THIS YEAR ORDER IN TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE RESILIENCY PLANS. TO ENSURE NETWORK POLICE ARE ABLE. TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS DURING THE DISASTER. FOR A POWER OUTAGE. INCLUDING PS SEVEN SEVEN HOURS. INTERIOR TO THREE FIRE AREA. WE'VE TAKEN A MAIN SINCE ENERGY COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT AND THE AND- THE RECENTLY CREATED BACK UP POWER RULES AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. OR UPSET THOSE TO PROCEEDINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED. TELCO COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY CONCERNED AT THIS BILL WOULD. SET THE CURRENT BACKUP POWER PROCEEDINGS AND I HEAR THEM ON THAT ASSURE THEIR CONCERN IN THAT IT'S NEVER BEEN OUR INTENTION. THE END AND WE WILL BE MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. IF THESE CONCERNS STILL PROCESS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHERE WE WANT TO GO. A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND RESEARCH HERE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SB SIX SEVENTY THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO SUBMIT. AN OUTAGENOTIFICATION TO- YES WHENEVER AN OUTAGE OCCURS IN THAT LIMITS THE ABILITY AND THAT LIMITS ABILITY MAKE NINE ONE ONE CALLS OR RECEIVE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS. THIS CRUCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A FAILURE IN THE NETWORK. THE ONLY BE SHARED WITH LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS LIKE COUNTY- YES INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS SO THOSE LOCAL EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES NOR OUTAGES THAT PUT THE PUBLIC AT RISK. OUR CURRENT BY THE STATUTORILY CAN'T SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHO IS THE. REGULATOR OF TELECOMS. WE ARE EMERGENCY TO NOT A THE STATUE OF TO SHOW THAT IN. WITH THE CPUC. CPC'S WITH KEEPING NETWORKS UP. CHARGE OF KEEPING THEM RUNNING AND MAKING THEM MORE RESILIENT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO WHERE OUTAGES KEEP OCCURRING. CANDIDLY THAT'S KIND OF CRAZY. THIS OUTAGE INFORMATION IS VITAL FOR UNDERSTANDING WHERE WEAKNESSES ARE TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS EXIST. IF AN OUTAGE OCCURS IN MERRY REPEATEDLY. THE C. P. C. NEEDS TO DETERMINE WHY THIS IS HAPPENING AND HOW TO PRISON PREVENT FUTURE OUTAGES WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION THE PC MUST RELY ON STAFF INITIATED A REQUEST. TO TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO LEARN ABOUT SOME FAILURES- YES ALREADY IS NOTIFIED ABOUT. THIS BILL CHANGES THAT. ENSURES THAT THE DATA THAT THE- STATE YES HAS. SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. CURRENTLY ONCE- YEAH TO RECEIVE STAMP ON A TELE. OUTAGE WHICH IS SIXTY MINUTES OF THE OUTER DISCOVERY THEY CAN THEN SEND IT ON TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IT'S ALREADY IN THE DATABASE SO WE'RE NOT CREATING ADDITIONAL RULES. SIMPLY ALLOWING PC TO BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO THAT DATABASE SB THREE FORTY ONE WILL STRENGTHEN THEIR TELECOMMUNICATIONS TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE. REQUIRING YES TO SHARE OUR INFORMATION WITH THE PC AND REQUIRES A PC TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. ACTION AND THEY'VE TAKEN ON THE VERY STRATEGIES. FINALLY I JUST WOULD LIKE TO GO OVER SOME CLAIMS. THAT CURRENTLY ARE OUT THERE AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE CLARIFY THAT NAY FOR HIS FACT NUMBER ONE. THIS BILL PROVIDES PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO CREATE BACKUP POWER RULES FOR T. CELL TOWERS- LANDLINE OPERATIONS IN CABLE PHONE SYSTEMS. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NOT ALL SOME THAT HAVE CLAIMED THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO THROW OUT THE BRAND NEW BACKUP POWER RULES. AGAIN WE TOOK AMENDMENTS IN ENERGY AND I CAN'T SAY THIS AGAIN WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. THAT WERE NOT HERE TO. SET THOSE PROCEEDINGS. THE STRONG BACKUP FOR POWER RULES THAT EXIST TODAY AT THE PC WILL STAY IN PLACE IN THE UNAFFECTED. BY THIS BILL. THIS IS A FACT. THIS BILL WILL ALSO HELP THE STATE IF THE TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY EVER LITIGATE SEES ROLES CHALLENGING THE FACT THAT THE PC HAS EXPLICIT AUTHORITY. TO ENACT BACKUP POWER RULES AND REGULATIONS THIS BILL GIVES AN EXPLICIT AUTHORITY. WE'RE ALSO PUTTING IN STATUTE TO SIT UP STRAIGHT IN THE RULES FROM ANY FEDERAL PREEMPTION CLAIM THAT SHOULD EVER BE A HOSTILE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. LASTLY SB THREE FORTY ONE WILL ALSO REQUIRE A WE HAS TO CREATE RULES ON OUTAGE MAPS. FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS REQUIRE THE PROVIDERS TO ABIDE BY THOSE RULES ENSURING THAT THERE'S CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD SO WHENEVER YOU ARE A CABLE CUSTOMER OR WYOMING CUSTOMER. YOU CAN RECEIVE SIMILAR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT OUTAGES AFFECTING YOUR COMMUNITY. IT'S A COMMON SENSE BILL I KNOW THAT THERE'S CONCERNS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WILL CONTINUE TO DO I WILL CONTINUE TO MEET WITH INDUSTRY. CONTINUE TO MEET WITH PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS I DID IT LAST WEEK I WILL CONTINUE TO DO IT IN THE WEEKS AHEAD YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT. AND THIS BILL INSURERS AND PROVIDERS IN THE CPC OR DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S. NINE ONE ONE NETWORKS AND TO ASSURE THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO THE CRUCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUTAGES ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE. TODAY MISTER CHAIR- I'M GRATEFUL TO BE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES ONE THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION COURCELLES SETTLES WITH US. AS WELL AS DANCE THE FINAL HE'S FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY COSTA MESA HE'S ALSO THE PRESIDENT A CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WHO SUPPORTS THIS BILL THE LEAD CALIFORNIA CITIES. ALSO SUPPORTS A STONER GRATEFUL FOR THEIR WORK THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE PERFECT TIME RESEARCHER. THANK YOU SENATOR. WELL NOW- MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO SPECIFIED SUPPORT DURING CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LAKE THE HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING FOR PROTOCOLS WERE TO TRY AND I'D SAY TRY TO LIMIT THESE FIRST- COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES I KNOW THAT THIS IS MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE SO I'M GONNA GIVE SOME LEEWAY- TO THE- TO THE INITIAL FIRST TWO WITNESSES. SO- WITH THAT- AND THEN I'M IN IT WILL ELEVEN DEBATE FOR THE ENTIRE TO TEND TO TIRE. DEBATE TO TEN MINUTES UPPERSIDE. SENATE MCGUIRE I BELIEVE- DANIEL STEFANO IN KOREA AS ALSO SO ALSO ARE ON THE COASTLINE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. PLEASE PROCEED. I GUESS MR STEFANO ARE YOU ON- YES SIR YES GOOD MORNING ON A REALTOR DOT. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRE MY NAME IS DAN STEFANO FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY OF COSTA MESA. AT PRESENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION- THE DISASTERS AND POWER SHUT OFFS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EMERGENCY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED BOTH FOR RESIDENTS. AND FIRST RESPONDERS. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY ONE WILL IMPROVE OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS BY CREATING STRONGER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS. AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHEN IT COMES TO TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGES AND BACK UP POWER SYSTEMS AS WELL AS MORE EFFECTIVE SHARING OF COMMUNITY ISOLATION OUTAGE INFORMATION. WHETHER WE LOOK TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY FIRESTORMS INCLUDING THE TUBBS FIRE IN SANTA ROSA FOR THE THOMAS FIRE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE DEVASTATING BUT IT DIDN'T DEBRIS FLOWS THAT FOLLOWED IN MODEST SETO IN EARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE CAN REFERENCE THE CAMPFIRE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OR THE WALLS HE FIRED THE STARTED LATER THAT DAY AND CUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR EVEN MORE RECENTLY- DOWN HERE IN ORANGE COUNTY THE SILVERADO AND BONFIRES. IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY AND SUBSEQUENT MOTHER DEBRIS FLOWS THAT FOLLOWED JUST MONTHS AGO- THESE ARE ALL VISITED EXAMPLES TO DEMONSTRATE GETTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SAFELY EVACUATED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF A DISASTER. CLEARLY ELEVATES THE DEFINING LINE BETWEEN CASUALTIES LIFE AND DEATH. THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE RESIDENTS AT ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS NEED AND HAVE COME TO EXPECT IT RIGHT WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT OUR PHONES WILL WORK WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. KEEPING THIS ALL IN PERSPECTIVE SMALLER OUTAGES OCCUR IN OUR IN OUR REPORTED- YES DEMONSTRATING WEAKNESSES IN OUR EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM. BUT THE CPUC HAS NO IDEA WHEN THEY ARE OCCURRING. THE CPUC REGULATES THE TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS AND REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE BACK UP POWER BUT IF TELCOS REPORT OUTAGES OF THE NETWORK STILL YES THE C. PCA. IS ABLE TO FIND OUT OF THAT OUTAGE OCCURRED. SB THREE FORTY ONE WILL RECTIFY THIS AND WILL IMPROVE OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. SB THREE FORTY ONE REQUIRES- YS TO SHARE COMMUNITY ISOLATION ALLERGY INFORMATION WITH THE CPUC AND REQUIRES THE CPUC TO REPORT THE LEGISLATURE ON ACTION TAKEN. USING THE COMMUNITY ISOLATION OUTAGE INFORMATION. IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR TIME ON THIS CONSIDERATION. FOR THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY ONE AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY IT IS APPRECIATED THANK YOU MR FADO- IS ALSO- ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES MISTER CHAIR PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY SO ZILLOW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL HAVING ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT NINE ONE ONE OUT AGES IS VITAL NOT ONLY TO THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS BOWSTRING OUTAGE MAP REQUIREMENTS WILL MAKE THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION MORE ACCESSIBLE WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY ENSURING TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE HAS APPROPRIATE BACKUP ELECTRICAL SUPPLY TO ADDRESS OUTAGES IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE CUSTOMERS CAN COMMUNICATE ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF DISASTER AND FIRST pDOING THEIR VITAL WORK. SB THREE FORTY ONE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING THE PCM CALLOW YES TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT BACKUP ELECTRICITY RULES FOR THE REASONS SHE HAS TO SAY IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB. THREE FORTY ONE. THANKS MISTER SALSOUL- NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE GALLERY WISHING TO SPEAK. IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE. I WOULD GO TO ROOM ONE TWELVE. SEEING NONE AS WELL THAT WILL MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE MODERATOR IF YOU'D PLEASE PROP THE INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FORTY ONE WE WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FORTY ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO NOW. ONE AND THEN ZERO YOUR SUPPORT OF SB THREE FORTY ONE. AND WE WILL GO TO A LINE OF LINE THIRTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YES HELLO MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY NUMBER ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANNEX OF THE LINE OF THIRTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. CAN YOU PLEASE SHARE IT ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK TURN IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE OF THIRTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING THIS IS JOHN KENNEDY WITH A RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY ONE TODAY WE THINK IT HELPS TO REINFORCE. THE VIEWS THE RESILIENCY CENTER TESTED AIM IN THE ORGANIZATION PLEASE AND YOUR SUPPORT. NEXT WEEK- MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORTING QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATOR- OKAY HAVING HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORTERS WILL NOW FOLLOW UP THE SAME PROCESS TO HEAR FROM OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY YES WE DO. PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS EARNING A ROSTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION HERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. THAT THIS MEASURE IS DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING OUTAGE REPORTS AND ALL IT WOULD DO IS COMPROMISE TO EXISTING ACTIONS RECENTLY TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PC. SO IN TWENTY NINETEEN THIS REQUIRED A MENTION THAT SB SIX SEVENTY WAS ADOPTED AND IS NOW IN PLACE SO SINCE JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY. IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. ATION SERVICE PROVIDERS MUST REPORT ALL AVERAGES TO THE CAL- YES HELLO YES THEN IN TURN MUST SUPPORT REMOTE SUPPORT AND SHARE THAT INFORMATION. WITH P. SAPS AND WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS PROTECTED. SO THAT'S ALREADY COVERED SO IT'S NICE TO HEAR THE PUBLIC SAFETY FOLKS SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE BUT THAT HAS BEEN THE LOSSES JERRY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY. WHAT WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THAT MEASURE WAS A CONFIDENTIALITY. VERSION THAT INFORMATION IS ABOUT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT TO BE SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC. THIS BILL WOULD UNDO THAT PROVISION UNDO THAT COMPROMISE THAT WAS ADOPTED IN SB SIX SEVENTY. AND NOW SHARE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WITH THE PUBLIC. IT WAS ALSO DONE WAS THE PC ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE RECENTLY ADOPTED NEW GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REPORT OUTAGES TO THE PUBLIC. THAT IS ALREADY LAW WE MUST PROVIDE THE CLUB THE PUBLIC WITH AN OUTAGE MAP WHENEVER WE HAVE. OUTAGES THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE PUBLIC SO THAT INFORMATION IS ALSO BEING SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC ALREADY TODAY THAT IS ALREADY THE LAW THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED ON FEBRUARY NINTH THE PC DECISION WAS ADOPTED ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH. THE STATE TO BE BLOOD THE DAYS IF THIS BILL IS A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT IN ADDITION. THIS BILL WOULD CODIFY A PC RECENT DECISION AGAIN ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH THAT REQUIRES US TO HAVE SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF BACKUP POWER AND SO THAT'S ALREADY CURRENT LAW TODAY. THAT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF THAT ARE GOING TO BE HARD TO MEET WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS WHICH ONLY HAS SIX MONTHS LEFT WE MUST HAVE SEVEN TO EIGHT HOURS A BACKUP POWER. IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S ALREADY A PART OF THE BILL TODAY ALL YOU WOULD DO IN ADOPTING THIS BILL. IS AGREE WITH THAT DO YOU SEE DECISION ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH I'M NOT SURE MANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT DECISION. BUT VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY WOULD BE YOUR ACQUIESCES TO WHAT WAS DONE THEN SO SORRY IT'S HARD TO BE WITH THIS PAST. AND SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR- CCJ OPPOSED. OKAY THANK YOU OF HAVING A HARD TIME READING THEIR I WOULD JUST ADD ONE LAST PROVISION IT TO THE TO THE ISSUE OF PREEMPTION. WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE PC DECISION. A COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDER WANTS TO LEGALLY CHALLENGE THAT DECISION YOU MUST DO SO WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. SO TO THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT THE PC HAS HIS STORY TO DO WHAT THEY ALREADY DID ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH. IS NOT VALID- PREEMPTION MUST BE DONE WITHIN MUST BE CHALLENGE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THAT DECISION OTHERWISE YOU HAVE NO STANDING IN COURT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THESE REASONS THE CABLE INDUSTRY IS OPPOSED. ANYBODY NOBODY ELSE UP ABOVE ANYBODY IN ROOM ONE TWELVE WISHING. TO TESTIFY THE SEEING NOBODY- NOW WILL MOVE TO THE WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE PROP THE INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE FORTY ONE. THANK YOU IF YOU'RE NOT POSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO NOW. WE WILL GO TO LINE OF FORTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. FIND FORTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN DO YOU HAVE IT ON MUTE. HELLO. ONE FORTY ONE. OKAY WE'LLMOVE ON TO THE NEXT LINE OF WINE THIRTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. LINE THIRTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. DO YOU HAVE A TIME YOU. WELL THE LINE OF BY TWENTY TO YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

A RESEARCHER AND MEMBERS OF THE JONATHAN ERA BELL ON BEHALF OF CTIA THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION INDUSTRY- AND WE OPPOSE SB THREE FOUR ONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND AGAIN WRE IN OPPOSITION OF SB THREE FORTY ONE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND OUR NEXT LINE WILL COME FROM NINE FORTY TWO. A LINE IS OPEN. HE MAKES ALL OF ON BEHALF OF FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT THE EVENT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU AND NEXT WILL GO TO A LINE OF FORTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THIS IS ONE CALCHAMBER IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU MODERATOR- NOW WE'RE GONNA- TURN THIS BACK OVER TO- THE MEMBERS SEE IF THERE'S ANY DISCUSSION HERE ON THE FLOOR TO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I SEE- CENTER PORTANTINO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- THANK YOU- TO THE AUTHOR- WE HAD SET EXCHANGE SOME ROBUST THE- QUESTIONS ANY PROVIDE A LOT OF ANSWERS I JUST IF HE COULD IN HIS CLOSER AS A QUESTION JUST. TO CLARIFY OR COMMENT ON THE- THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS IS A DUPLICATIVE EFFORT WHETHER YOU KNOW Y. Y. E. X. THE NEED FOR THE EXPANSION OF DATA COLLECTION IS WARRANTED. BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING CURRENTLY IF HE COULD pALSO TOUCH UPON THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AND- IF THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE SO. THAT INFORMATION WILL GET MISUSED IF HE COULD EITHER COVER THOSE TWO ISSUES AND IT'S CLOSE THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SENATE MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN THANK YU MR PORTANTINO FOR THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH LEADING INTO TODAY'S HEARING AND VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR READ THAT ROBUST QUESTIONING THOUGHT ACTIVE AT A TALK ABOUT THE PC'S ROLAND I TO TALK ABOUT- YES IT'S REAL FIRST AND FOREMOST YEAH. WE PASSED SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY BECAUSE UP UNTIL. LAST YEAR FIFTY OFFICIALS LOCAL YES MANAGERS COUNTY CITIES DIDN'T KNOW WHEN THERE WAS AN OUTAGE. THE ONLY REASON THEY FOUND OUT THERE IS OUTAGES WHEN THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WENT DOWN WHEN FOLKS PICKED UP THE PHONE THEY CAN CALL NINE ONE ONE. SO SIX SEVENTY. PROVIDED THE DATA. TO LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICE. AS WELL AS OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES THE COUNTY LEVEL. WITH THAT DATA. OUR LIVE PERSON TO TALK TO ME ABOUT WHEN THE RESTORATION. OF THAT AVERAGE WOULD OCCUR. IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS IN MANY PARTS REAL CALIFORNIA. ALLERGIES COULD LAST DAYS DAYS WE WOULD NOT KNOW WHY WHEN THERE IS RESTORATION THERE'S A STEP TO DO THIS NOW THAT DATA THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE STATE- YES WHO THEN GIVES IT TO LOCAL- YES AND IT IS CONFIDENTIAL. THAT DATA IS NOT SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. SO I GOT TO BE CANDID WITH YOU IT'S NOT. DOUBLING THE EFFORTS TO GIVING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHO IS CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO SEE THAT DATA TO MAKE THE NECESSARY FIXES TO KEEP THE STATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. UP RUNNING RESILIENCE. THAT'S IT. IT'S FROM THE SAME DATABASE THAT ONLY HAS ALREADY HAS BUT BY STATE LAW THE PC CANNOT SEE THAT INFORMATION THEY'RE FLYING BLIND THEY'RE FLYING BLIND. SO I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE CONFIDENTIALITY IS THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THIS BILL IN THE BILL IN AGAIN YOU KNOW ME I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS ON THIS. SB THREE FORTY ONE KEEPS THE INFORMATION. PROVIDED IN SB SIX SEVENTY CONFIDENTIAL- SO SB SIX SEVENTY AGAIN PROVIDED A LIMITATION OF THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO REQUEST CALLOW YESS OUTAGE DATA- FROM THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT SIMILARLY IN THIS BILL TODAY RIGHT NOW. THERE IS A LIMITATION ON THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO REQUEST DATA PROVIDED CONFIDENTIALLY TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION BY COMPANIES. OR THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE P. R. A. BECAUSE THE P. C. CODE FIVE EIGHTY THREE. SO WHAT THAT SAYS IS THAT ANY INFORMATION WOULD BE PROTECTED ON THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE FIVE EIGHTY THREE. IT'S ON IT YOU CANNOT HEAR IT. STILL REMAINS CONFIDENTIAL IT'S THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT'S CURRENTLY IN SIX SIX SEVENTY THAT IS BEING TRANSFERRED OVER TO THIS CURRENT BILL. SO LOOK I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S CONCERN FROM INDUSTRY I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. CTIA I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO CABLE FOR CONTINUED TO ENGAGE IN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS. AS FIRE SEASON APPROACHES. WE HAVE TO BE A LAW THE PEOPLE WE WORK FOR IN THE HIGH IN THE AIR TO SAY THAT WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BE TO KEEP OUR NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING. IN RIGHT NOW THERE IS A GIANT LOOPHOLE THE REGULATOR OF TELECOM IN THE STATE DOESN'T GET THE OUTAGE DATA. WE DON'T GET IT. SO AND APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I DON'T KNOW THE FOR TO HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND SECURING THANK YOU MISTER PORTANTINO. THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE SENATOR ALAN. THANK YOU DID YOU CENTER MCGUIRE FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- I HATE I GUESS MY SO MY CONCERN HERE IS. THIS DEFAULT TO DIESEL AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOUR BILL SAYS THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT- YOU KNOW PREVENTS. THE OUR TELECOM PARTNERS FROM DEFAULTING TO DIESEL OR OR SORRY SORRY NOTHING THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM USING CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES BUT THERE'S ALSO NOTHING IN HERE THAT REQUIRES. CONSIDERATION OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES. YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN. ONLY OF COURSE IS DIESEL- VERY POLLUTING- BUT IT ALSO WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE DURING FIRE EVENTS DIESEL FUEL TRANSPORT CAN BE A REALLY MAJOR RISK AS WELL. NOT BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S SO FLAMMABLE. AND WE'VE SEEN AND WE'VE SEEN FROM OUR MILITARY AS WELL THE USE OF SOLAR BATTERIES FUEL CELLS AT CENTER THAT CAN BE A LOT MORE RELIABLE FOR HARD TO REACH SITES. AND I GUESS I SO MY QUESTION HERE I KNOW THAT WHEN CENTER DODD WORKED ON A SIMILAR BILL WITH SB TEN NINETY NINE- THEY THEY TOOK AN AMENDMENT THAT AT LEAST ENCOURAGED. MOVEMENT IN THAT DIRECTION I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL. TO PRECLUDE BUT THERE'S ALSO DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHING IN THE BILL TO ENCOURAGE. MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION AND I IT REALLY IT'S A CONCERN THAT I HAVE- AS I CONSIDER THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH I CENTER ALLEN AT FOR THAT LOOK. BUT BE CANDID WE HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL WALKING THE LINE NOT TO UPSET THE CURRENT PROCEEDING. AS YOU HEARD TODAY THAT IS A VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC. SO IN THE CURRENT PROCEEDING BOTH FOR LANDLINE AS WELL CELL PHONE- DAVE TALKED ABOUT THE TYPE OF BACKUP POWER. IN THAT PROCEEDING- THE CPC ALLOWS. TELCOS TO BE ABLE TO USE DIESEL IN THE SHORT TERM BUT THE CPC ALSO DIRECTS TELCOS TO USE CLEAN BACKUP TECHNOLOGY WHEN REASONABLE. AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE AND JUST BEING VERY BLUNT IN TRANSPARENT CENTER ALLEN- THIS BILL IS AGNOSTIC ON THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT AT TELCOS WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY. BUT WE ARE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO STEP OUR TOTAL INTO THAT PROCEEDING. AND UPSET THE WORK TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS DOING BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL- BUT- HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS- BUT I JUST WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT ON WHY. WE DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS BECAUSE IF WE ARE TO. FOCUS ON THIS. IT WOULD UPSET THE PROCEEDING ON WHERE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION CURRENTLY IS AT. OKAY I MEAN I GUESS. SO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE PEACE SO CAN YOU GIVE US A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THAT DISCUSSION OF THE PCM I GUESS MY CONCERN IS HERE YOUR- YOU ARE PROACTIVELY ASKING. EVERYBODY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THESE BACKUP. WHAT PROVIDING STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR A COUPLE FULL NUMBER ONE. THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO OVERSEE AND REGULATE. TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES HERE AND BACK UP POWER RULES. NUMBER TWO TO INSURE THAT THEY GET THE DATA. THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING COLLECTED FROM OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES THEY GET THAT DATA TO BE ABLE TO HELP WITH THE RESILIENCY OF THE SYSTEM. CURRENTLY AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN THE PROCEEDING AND I'LL QUOTE FROM IT. THE PROPOSAL DIRECTS PROVIDERS UTILIZE CLEAN ENERGY BACKUP POWER OPTIONS AS REASONABLE BEFORE USING DIESEL GENERATIONS. TO MEET THE BACKUP POWER REQUIREMENT AMONG OTHER PRETTY. ARE CHANNELED. IN YOU'VE HEARD THIS TREMENDOUS I THINK OF YOU- IS. THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT US. PUTTING OUR TOTAL INTO THE CURRENT PROCEEDING SETTING THE CURRENT PROCEEDING OR NEW. OUTSIDE OF THE PROCESS. SO IF WE WERE TO GO IN FOR ON. THE ISSUE DIESEL VERSUS CLEAN WE THEN- START. SITTING NEXT. IN WHAT I SAY TO EACH EVERYONE OF YOU HERE TODAY IS THAT WE'RE NOT THIS BILL WILL NOT TOUCH THE CURRENT PROCEEDING. SO THE PRESSURE POINT AND I DON'T NOT AT ALL TRYING TO PASS THE BUCK. IT'S GOING TO NEED TO BE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON THIS ISSUE OR THEIR NEED TO BE SEPARATE LEGISLATION ON THAT BECAUSE THIS BILL WE CANNOT BECAUSE OF THE DELICATE BALANCE INTO CONCERNS YOU'RE HEARING FROM INDUSTRY. THE DATE BEEN ENGAGING A PROCEEDING IN TRYING TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS THING MOVING- WE JUST CAN'T UPSET THAT COURTESY IN THE PC YEAH I HEAR YOU I'M OF COURSE BUT WE'RE STEPPING IN WITH THIS BILL RIGHT I MEAN TO THIS BILL IS. IS TAKING A PROACTIVE STEP IN INCREASING THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE TELECOMS IT'S NOT. AND I DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE PC WHEN IT COMES TO SETTING STRONGER STANDARDS. SO. THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO. IN ANY BY THE WAY THE YOU SEE DOES REALLY HAVE A RESPONSE. IN THE AREA I MEAN THERE THEY'RE THEIR THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND- HE'S IN- AND- MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THE POWER THEY NEED SO. WELL THIS IS WHAT THE BILL DOES THAT ALSO THIS BILL GIVES THEM THE GRANTED STATUTORY AUTHORITY WHICH THEY BELIEVE THEY ALREADY HAVE BY THE WAY OVER TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND IT GIVES IN THE CLEAR STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO MANDATE BACKUP POWER RULES THE REASON WHY THAT IS NAMED MANDATE NEEDS AND IT IS. BY THIS LEGISLATURE IS IN CASE THAT THERE IS LITIGATION SINCE THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY BUT AGAIN I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR AND I'M NOT AT ALL TURN THE ARGUMENTATIVE AND I JUST WANT TO THANK SENATOR ALAN CENTER ALLEN HAS BEEN A CHAMPION ON THIS ISSUE. I INTEND NO B. S. ON THIS- WE JUST CAN'T WE'RE NOT STEPPING INTO THE PROCEEDING- WE ARE AREN'T INCREASING REQUIREMENTS FOUR NINE DECREASING REQUIREMENTS WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING THAT THEY HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND TO BE TO GET THEM THE DATA THEY NEED TO BE A TO CREATE. A MORE RESILIENT AND SAFE AT WORK. SO I. IF YOU DON'T MIND I'M A FOLLOW UP ON CENTER ALLEN'S- QUESTIONING SO OF TO ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION CENTER MCGUIRE IS THAT- IT REQUIRES THE CPUC TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT A SEVENTY TWO HOUR POT. BACKUP POWER REQUIREMENTS WHICH MEANS LARGE DIESEL GENERATORS IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE INCLUDING FIFTH DISCO LOS ANGELES THE OTHER URBAN AREAS NOT JUST THE HIGHER THREAT DISTRICTS. THE CPC IS. DEVELOPING THEIR CRITERIA ON A TIER TWO AND THREE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS MAYBE THAT'S ONE WAY OF GETTING OUT I I'M NOT I I'D LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT DANGER HAVE YOU. HAD THAT AMENDED. OUT OF THE BILL ARE YOU STILL REQUIRING THAT FOR THE ENTIRE STAY BECAUSE THAT MAY BE ONE OF THE WAYS TO LIMIT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND NOT DO IT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE JUST TO TIER TWO AND- THREE BUT ALL THE TIME. THAT THEY DON'T RESPOND IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION SECURE THANK YOU- OUR LANGUAGE IS A GNOSTIC ON THE TEARS- WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CREATE BACKUP POWER RULES. FOR AGNOSTIC ON THE TEARS CURRENTLY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS A CONNECTOR TO TIER THREE. AND WE WILL BE MORE THAN WILLING TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T UPSET THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS. WITH OR WITHOUT THIS BILL. WITH OR WITHOUT THE BILL THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION COULD GO AFTER TIER ONE FIFTY ONE INTO RIGHT NOW. THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THE PROCEEDING IT DOESN'T TOUCH THE TEARS THAT THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST FOCUSING ON TIER TWO TIER THREE- NOW- HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO. TAKE AGAIN CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS IT DOESN'T TOUCH PROCEEDING. THAT'S THE SAME REASON AS WHAT SENATOR ALLEN IS DISCUSSING ABOUT THE CLEAN ENERGY. WE ARE NOT GOING TO TOUCH THE SPECIFIC TEARS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT HERE TO BE OF ABSENT THAT PROCEEDING IN THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THAT DECISION. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION THANK YOU IS CENTER LASER BICA. PLEASE PROCEED. THE EX MISTRESS OF THE THANK- CARE DOT- I TO LIVE THE AUTHOR FOR HIS GREAT LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA- HE'S BEEN AT IT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HAS DIED DOWN AT THE MICRO LEVEL. TO SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE CREATED GREAT. ANGST IN TROUBLE. AND FOR A LOT OF OUR RESIDENTS AND I APPRECIATE- CENTER MCGUIRE YOUR LEADERSHIP. IT IS ARGUMENTATIVE BILLS TOO MODEST- THAT AS YOU HAVE WORK TO TRY TO WEED THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT OPINIONS OUT THERE AND THE POWER THAT DOESN'T WANT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT FOR THE POWER ISSUES- DEAD DEAD DEAD IS A BILL IS BEEN TRIMMED DOWN TO A VERY MODEST PLACE AND YOU'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT HOW YOU'VE TRIED TO STRADDLE LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND I COMPLIMENT YOU ON IT BUT- THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE DEFERRING TO THE PC. ON THESE MATTERS. THIS IS ABOUT LEGISLATING. NOT REGULATING AND WE SHOULD LEGISLATE. BUT THIS BILL IN THIS AUTHOR HAS TRIED TO BLOCK THIS FINE LINE AND SHOW DEFERENCE TO THE PC AND THEIR ENGAGEMENT WHICH WE APPRECIATE. HI ANYTHING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT HAS- OFFENDED THE POWER OUT THERE- THAT HAS SOMEHOW STOPPED US FROM LEGISLATING IN THIS AREA. AND IT'S WORTH NOTING. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT WE'VE FACED THIS DEBATE ABOUT THE TYPE OF POWER AND ENERGY THAT'S USED AS BACK UP AND I APPRECIATE. THE GREAT ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP FROM THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA ON THIS ISSUE AND IT HAS COME UP IN A NUMBER OF PLACES. BUT THIS ISN'T THE PLACE TO HAVE THAT DEBATE. THAT THAT'S THE SENATOR AND OTHERS ARE WELCOME TO ENGAGE IN THOSE REQUIREMENTS IF THEY SO WISH AND TO PUT A BILL BEFORE THE SENATE- THAT. PROVIDES CLARITY AS THEY SEE IT FOR HOW THAT SHOULD BE DONE AND THEY'RE WELCOME TO DO THAT. BUT THE BURDEN THIS BILL AND THESE MODEST REFORMS WITH THAT ARGUMENT TO ME IS UNFAIR. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. THESE ARE VERY STRESSFUL TIMES FOR OUR RESIDENTS OUT THERE. AND THEY EXPECT AND DEPEND UPON US TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING AND WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE IT'S NOT WORKING STEP IN THE BREACH DO OUR JOBS RESPONSIBLY TO ENSURE THAT HAPPENS CENTER MCGUIRE COMPLEMENT YOU I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND MOVE THE BUILT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AS CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS **** CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO- CAN JST TAG ALONG ON THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAD.

STILL COURSE THE PUBLIC LOOKS TO US TO LOOK OUT FOR THEIR THEIR NEEDS AND CONCERNS BOTH IN TERMS OF- PER YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE RESPONSE. ADEQUATE SERVICE AND ALSO- HAD CLEAN AIR SO WE'VE GOT RESPONSIBILITIES ON MONDAY VARIOUS LEVELS AND MAYBE THIS IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO. TO TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ON THE ISSUES THAT I RAISED- THOUGH I DO. AND WE ARE WEIGHING IN ON ON REQUIRING BACKUP POWER AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE BEING CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT JUST ENCOURAGING MORE AND MORE. EASILY HOUSTON IN THESE SITUATIONS WHEN THERE ARE BETTER ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE BOTH BETTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME SAFER- WHEN YOU GET INTO THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DIESEL- MOVEMENT IN AND IN DISASTER SITUATIONS SO MAYBE THIS IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO. INJECT THAT ISSUE INTO THE CONVERSATION BUT. I THINK IT'S SOME IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE GOT TO. I WITH THAT I'M CERTAIN PREPARED SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUES WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM IS FOR.

COMING THROUGH OKAY. COMING THROUGH LOUD AND CLEAR OKAY THANKS FOR THE YEAH I'M THIS. IS IT SB FIVE FIVE INCOMES CRUCIAL TIME MR COMMITTEE- THINKING CHEER. HE'S PARTNERSHIP SHE'S WORK- ONE EXTENDERS TERM TO SO ATTORNEY. HOUSE CENTERS. YES HOLD ON TO YOUR YOUR COMING LOUD AND CLEAR IN STARRY. BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD BY A TECH X. YOU TO TURN SPEAKER DOWN ON YOUR COMPUTER PERHAPS. OKAY SEE HOW THAT WORKS IF YOU COULD START OVER I'D APPRECIATE IT. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AS THIS. SOUNDS GOOD SO FAR BUT SEE IF WE CAN. BEFORE I BEGIN. STILL LOOKING I DON'T SEE ANY AMENDMENTS YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD SO THAT'S A CASE PROCEED- PROVIDING ADMINISTRATION I THINK SAID MORE THAN I CAN SAY- IN THEIR INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN JOBS PLAN WHERE THEY LAID OUT. A COMPLETELY TRANSFORMATIVE SCOPE OF INVESTMENT IN THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE SECTOR THAT. WE WANT TO SEE. MARCH IS DOUBLE IN SIZE BUT INCREASED TO TEN X. WHAT IT IS TODAY OVER THE NEXT DECADE. THEY PUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS FORD IN THE AMERICAN JOBS PLAN AND THIS THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF HIS PROPOSED ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS. THERE'S A LOT OF BUDGET ACTION PROCEEDING HERE BUT I THINK THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO TRY TO GET SOME GOVERNANCE AND STEM COHESION AMONGST TWENTY FIVE DISPARATE STATE AGENCIES AND ALL MULTIPLE LEVELS OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS ALL ADMINISTERING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF. OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROGRAMS AND IF THERE'S THIS MUCH. MONEY ON THE TABLE POTENTIALLY AND THIS MANY SERIOUS STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING NOT JUST OUR COUNTRY BUT OUR STATE BE A GLOBAL LEADER IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE NOT JUST LIKE YOUR VEHICLE SALES BUT IN THEIR MANUFACTURING IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN PRODUCTION. LOOKING AT ASSETS LIKE LITHIUM VALLEY OUT INSULTING SEE ANOTHER WAYS TO DEPLOY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THIS ARENA WE THINK WE NEED A CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO HAVE CENTRAL LEADERSHIP SO THE BILL PROPOSES JUST THAT- CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC VEHICLES ALREADY THAT WE THINK THE TIMING MAKES SENSE- THERE'S ALIGNMENT ACROSS STAKEHOLDERS INDUSTRY LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. AND CRITICAL BRING SOME COHESION TO AN ALREADY EXCELLENT RANGE OF REGULATORY AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AMONGST- OUR STATE AGENCIES NOT INTENDED TO UNDERCUT ANY OTHER AUTHORITY OR ADD ANYTHING TO CLICK IT IF BUT TO HAVE A CENTRALIZED FRONT DOOR SO THAT. THE BIG PLAYERS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND SUPPLY CHAIN HAVE ONE PLACE TO GO TO A TO BUILD SOME COHERENCE IN THIS LANDSCAPE AS WE TRY TO BE SOMETHING TRANSFORMATIVE. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY- MATT PETERSON IS THE CEO OF THE L. A. CLEANTECH INCUBATOR AS WELL AS SPENCER READER WHOSE WITH AUDI ADD TO PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

COMES FROM ORGANIZATIONS CREATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION PARTNERSHIP FOR UNIQUE REGIONAL. COOPERATION OF PUBLIC PARKS PRIVATE PLAYERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND WORKING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION. IN GREATER LOS ANGELES FURTHER OUR GOALS INCLUDE GOING 25% OF THE BEYOND WHAT AT THE TIME WHEN WE SET THAT TARGET WAS GOVERNOR BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TWENTY EIGHTEEN- FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY. INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF. WHAT VEHICLES ON THE ROAD LOOKED TRUCKS YOUR EMISSIONS TRUCKS IN THE CORE IN CHARGE. AND AS LOOK AT HOW WE ACHIEVE THOSE TARGETS FOR EXAMPLE. 30% OF ALL THE CARS ON THE ROAD BY THE TIME THE WAY OVER FROM TWENTY TWO EIGHT OLYMPIC APPAREL GAMES HERE- WE NEEDED PARTNERS BEYOND WHAT WE HAD CABLE GERMS OF REGION. PLAYERS WE KNEW WE HAD LOOK AT FEDERAL LEVEL AS STERN TALKING IN PERSON BY THE- AMERICANS PLAN WE HAVE A PARTNER NOW THE WHITE HOUSE TO HELP US GET THERE WE NEED TO WORK WITH CON. TO MAKE SURE K.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATOR AND THANKS TO ALL OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS. ANY MEMBERS WISHING TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE CENTER ARCH ALETTA. YES THANK YOU TO SHARE. IF I MAY ADD ASK A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. THIS IS CERTAIN. YES THANK YOU SENATOR STERN LOOKING AT THE BILL I SEE A LOT OF REFERENCES TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND PLUG IN CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING IN REFERENCE TO HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES. WHILE INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY ELECTRIC CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER VALUE IN ACHIEVING THE STAGE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS THEY DO NOT GET US. OUT THERE ALONE WE NEED TO LOOK TO THE TO ADDING ADDITIONAL OF WAY TO CLEAN OUR AIR HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE IN DOUBT ONLY ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT OPTION TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO MY QUESTION TO YOU SENATORS. WILL THIS NEW AUTHORITY ALSO PROMOTE ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN VEHICLES AND IT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME TO AMEND YOUR BILL SO WE COULD ALSO INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN ADVANCING OUR HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. I THE QUESTION AND ALSO YOUR YOUR LEADERSHIP CENTER TO LET IN THIS SPEECH. I'M NOT JUST. HI GENERATE LARGE BIG GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN AND LOOKING AT THE PORTS. THE REASON WE- WE DIDN'T SORT OF FOCUSING ON HYDROGEN HERE- IN THE STATE IT SORT OF LIGHT DUTY FOCUSED SECTOR- THERE'S ALREADY SOMETHING I CALL THE FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP ON UNDER ALL THE UNDER THE CURRENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN THE HIGH DURING SPACE THAT IS SORT OF THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY FOR PLANNING. HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAD A GOAL OF I THINK- A HUNDRED STATIONS AT ONE POINT AND NOW IT'S I THINK THE GOAL HAS INCREASED SO WE ACTUALLY WERE TRYING TO COPY THAT MODEL A LITTLE BIT HERE FOR THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CITED DIDN'T HAVE THAT SAME AUTHORITY. BUT IF THERE'S A NEED TO THE CENTRALIZER DO ANYMORE THAT KIND OF BUSINESS INTERFACING OR SUPPLY CHAIN WORK ON THE FUEL CELL AND HYDROGEN SIDE I'M I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT MIGHT MY SENSE FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO IS. THEY KIND OF HAD THEIR ONE STOP SHOP ALREADY ON THE HYDROGEN SIDE AND DIDN'T WIN HERE THAT NEED AS MUCH FROM THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY BUT I I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE I AGREE ESPECIALLY IN IN THE HEAVY DUTY ARENA- BUT YOU KNOW. IN ALL SECTORS I THINK WE SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IS JUST THAT- YEAH I WE SAW THE GAP HERE ON THE EASY SIDE WHICH. IS WHY WE DID THE BILL THIS WAY. SHE PARTNERSHIP ON THE FUTURE OF A HYDROGEN I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. GREAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR COMMENTS MANY MEMBER. CENTER BACKER. THE AUTHOR THIS IS THAT. THANK YOU THIS IS THE KIND OF THINKING CUT EFFORT THAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MAKE THE GIANT LEAP FORWARD BY THAT HE MENTIONED IN THAT MAKE MATT PETERSON MENTIONED IN HIS TESTIMONY I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM IN THE FUTURE AND WITH THIS BODY TO HELP US MAKE THIS LEAP WHICH IS VERY MUCH NEEDED. SENATE HUESO. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE- FROM UP BECAUSE OF IT- AND REGARDING HYDROGEN AND THAT WHY. IN IN EVERY POLICY. NOT EVERY POLICY I MEAN TIME. CALIFORNIA HAS TENDED IS TO FAVOR ELECTRIC IN SO MANY AREAS. BUT JOB IN I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY PRUDENT FOR CALIFORNIA TO THE AND I THINK THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THIS TO BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THERE IS SOME ROOM IN THIS BILL TO ACCOMPLISH THAT AND I JUST WANTED TO ECHO MY SUPPORT IN MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. AND AT THIS BILL DIDN'T COME TO MY COMMITTEE AND BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND BECAUSE OF THE NEW RULES. ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVIEW OF BILLS BUT- I THINK. THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD. A WARRANT SOME REVIEW IN THIS AREA AND I JUST WANTED TO ENCOURAGE A DIALOGUE TO CONTINUE AS THIS PROCESS UNFOLDS AND- THIS IS A GOOD BILL LOVE TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD. AND US TO WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY TO SEE HOW WE CAN- EXPANDED TO INCLUDE COURAGE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO BE EMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE INNOVATIONS STATE AND- INNOVATION SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF UP. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC POLICY AND HERE. IN OUR STATE AND I THINK WE HAVE THE TALENT DISLODGE THE LATER CHIEF THAT WE SHOULD PUT. OUR MINDS TO WORK COLLECTIVELY TO ACHIEVE THAT AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS. ADVOCACY IN IN THIS AREA FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK WORK WITH HIM IN MY COMMITTEE. AND TO- SEE HIM CHAMPION SO MANY WONDERFUL ISSUES IN THIS COMMUNITY THIS WILL BE. ANOTHER HOPEFULLY WE COULD WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE ANOTHER BIG VICTORY. FOR OUR FOR OUR STATE IN THIS IN THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CENTER STERN I HAVE ONE DOT COM AT. WORK NOT COMMON QUESTION. IT'S THE HYDROGEN PARTNERSHIP I THINK IS WHAT YOU CALL THAT. IS THAT IT LEGISLATIVELY- IT IS AT A LEAD WAS AT A LEGISLATIVE DECISION TO CREATE THAT. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION HE WAS IN I KNOW WAS IN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH RE AUTHORIZED. THE HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM- I THINK THE FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP IS ACTUALLY CALLED OUT IN THAT LEGISLATION BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEEN CODIFIED IS SORT OF A- CENTRAL AUTHORITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT THIS BILL WOULD SO MAYBE THAT'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT WE CAN. WORK WITH YOU AND CENTER TO LET IN CENTER HUESO ON A STATE. KICK THE TIRES THERE SO TO SPEAK IN AND SEE IF MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO. CODIFY CENTRALIZE THAT AS THE WORDY ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK TO. NEW FUNDING STREAMS SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU HAVE A DRESS THE ISSUES. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER STREET WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WE EXPECT ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION HERE VERY SOPHISTICATED. GROUP IS WORKED ON THESE ISSUES FOR A LONG TIME SO APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP AND WE WELCOME YOU ALL INTO THE MIX HERE AND WHEN I THINK ALSO MY JOINT AUTHORS AND HERTZBERG FOR.

HI ALLEN AYE ARCHULETA AYE ARCHULETA AYE BAKER. BAKER HI FORGES. STRAFFORD GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE WESSEL AYE WESSEL AYE JONES NO JONES NO KAMLAGER MELENDEZ NO MELENDEZ NO PORTANTINO. PORTANTINO HI RUBIO WILK. THAT IS SEVEN- VOTES THREE KNOWS TO BE PLACED ON CALL. WELL NOW MOVES TO FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SB FIVE SEVEN SIX CENTER ARCHULETA. YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER CHAIR. DODD IT'S A AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR ALLOW ME TO PRESENT THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS REFERENCED IN COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON PAGE THREE. THIS BILL SENATE BILL FIVE SEVEN SIX CONTINUES A SERIES OF MORATORIUMS ON CARD CLUB EXPANSIONS AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWS A MODEST GROWTH. CALIFORNIA CARD CLUBS ARE FUNDAMENTAL ASSETS IT MANY OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES IN CITIES. SUBURBS EVEN SERVE AS THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF TAX REVENUE. FOR THE CITY IN WHICH THEY'RE LOCATED. CARDROOM TAX FUND ESSENTIAL PUBLIC IF THEY FIND THE CENTRAL PUBLIC SAFETY HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING FUNDS FOR PARKS AND WATER DELIVERY AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. CARD ROOMS ALSO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT AND SECONDARY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN DIRE NEED. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS EXERCISED ITS AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE MORATORIUMS ON THE EXPANSION OF GAMING WITH THE LAST EXTENSION OF MORATORIUM BE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AT TWENTY THIRTEEN. OVER THE YEARS THE STATE HAS ALLOWED FOR REASONABLE INCREASES IN NUMBER OF TABLES AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD PERMIT IN A CARD ROOM. THE CURRENT MORATORIUM ON CARD CLUB EXPANSIONS IS SET TO SUNSET JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. FURTHERMORE THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TABLES THAT MAYBE LOCALLY APPROVED AN EXISTING CARD CLUBS SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. TO ENSURE STABILITY AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES THIS BILL WILL EXTEND THE CURRENT MORATORIUM TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN I'M SORRY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND WILL LAW A MODEST INCREASE ON TABLES AT EXISTING CAR CLUBS. MORE SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SUBJECT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT APPROVAL UP TO TWO TABLES PER YEAR WITH A MAXIMUM OF TEN ADDITIONAL TABLES. IN TURN THIS WILL PROVIDE NEEDED FINANCIAL STABILITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT RELY ON REVENUES FROM THE LICENSED GAMBLING. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN CONTINUING THE CARDROOM MORATORIUM AND ALLOWING FOR A MODEST GROWTH. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. WITH WITH ME TODAY I HAVE HAD MANY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CARDROOM ALLIANCE IT ON THE PHONE IS ONE GARCIA WITH THE CALIFORNIA CITIES OF SELF RELIANCE BOTH ARE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. PLEASE PROCEED MISTER MANNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AT MANNING WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF HAWAIIAN GARDENS AND THE- CALIFORNIA COURTROOM ALLIANCE WHICH INCLUDES- THE BICYCLE CASINO COMMERCE- THE OAKS THE GRAND AND- CRYSTAL CASINO SO CLUBS IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NICE TO BE BACK INTO THE CAPITAL TODAY- IT'S BEEN A WHILE SO- PLEASURE TO SEE YOU ALL- THIS BILL- DOES THREE PRIMARY THINGS IS- SEVEN ARCHULETA SAID FIRST THE CONTINUES THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR MORATORIUM WHICH PROVIDES STABILITY TO BOTH- THE CAR CLUB INDUSTRY AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO. WHOSE REVENUES DEPEND ON THE INDUSTRY- SECONDS THE BILL PROVIDES- MODEST GROWTH OR- BALANCE- BETWEEN THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE GROWTH AND THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE NO GROWTH- WE HAVE SETTLED ON TWO TABLES A YEAR- FOR FIVE YEARS AND TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR A TEN TABLE CLUB A SMALL CLUB THAT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. FOR A LARGE CLUB LIKE WINE GARDENS- IT'S ONLY 1% GROWTH A YEAR WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE TABLES SO THIS IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO THE SMALLER CLUBS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE. TO GROW AT ALL FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. THE AND- THE LAST THING IN IS CONTINUE THE LEAD PRESENCE IN THIS FIELD TO STOP RAMPANT GROWTH OF URBAN GAMING BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT- GAMING IMPACT ON SOCIETY IN GENERAL AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MEASURED GROWTH AND SO ON SOME VOTER POSE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UNLIMITED LOCAL CONTROL AND RAMPANT GROWTH- SUMMER OPPOSED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO EITHER NO GROWTH OR THEY DON'T WANT THE CAR CLUBS TO EXIST AT ALL AND SO WE'RE HERE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE AND SWEETS BY. TO KEEP THE INDUSTRY- GROWING I WILL SAY THE LAST THING IS THIS BILL WILL BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL TO THE INDUSTRY- WHICH HAS SUFFERED TREMENDOUSLY DURING THE PANDEMIC- MOST CLUBS OR DOWN AS MUCH AS 7580% UP 290% IN REVENUE AND TO OUR OWN CLUB IS DOWN FROM TWO THOUSAND TO FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES SO THIS BILL AS WELL TIME TO HELP THE INDUSTRY- GROW INTO THE FUTURE AS WE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN.

THE SITUATION IS SET LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EVERYWHERE SCRAMBLING FOR ALTERNATIVE REVENUE SOLUTIONS. VIEWED THROUGH THE LENS OF COVERT AND ITS IMPACT ON LOCAL REVENUES. IS MEASURES EXTREMELY HOSTILE TO THE CITY'S CURRENTLY HOSTING SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE CARD. THE REALITY IS THE CARVINGS ARE REVENUE GENERATING ENTITIES THIS BILL WOULD CHOKE THOSE REVENUES OFF THE CONCLUDING EXPANSION OR SEVERELY RESTRICTING THE NUMBER OF TAKE GAMING TABLES A GRANULAR REGULATION THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY. WOULD RESIDE EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF LOCAL DISCRETION AND LOCAL POLICE POWER. THIS MEASURE IS MORE ABOUT PERPETUATING MARKET DOMINANCE HANDFUL OF LORD CARD CLUBS ENTITIES ABOUT CONTROLLING. PROLIFERATION OF GAMBLING I THINK YOU. THANK YOU- MISS R. CITY- KOTO PLEASE PROCEED. HOPEFULLY I DIDN'T- MISPRONOUNCING NAME TOO BADLY. POLICE ARE YOU ON THE LINE. CAROLINA'S OPEN. TWEET I KNEW YOURSELF. ONE MOMENT. OPERATOR WHILE YOU'RE WORKING WITH HER I'M GONNA GO TO. GOOD YES CAN YOU HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU PLEASE PROCEED. WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT LEAST ARE COULD BE A CORNER WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION AS SB FIVE SEVENTY SIX HE'S ORIGINAL ORDINANCES WERE PUT IN PLACE MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO AND HAVE ALLOWED VERY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR MODERNIZING. TODAY MANY JURISDICTIONS SEEKS TO EXPAND GAMING LOCALLY BUT ARE PREVENTED BY THIS MORATORIUM SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE WRITTEN IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE FOR THAT VERY REASON. THE ORIGINAL STATE MORATORIUM WAS MEANT TO PROVIDE A SHORT HIATUS WHILE NEWLY CREATED REGULATORY AGENCIES. UNDER THE GAMBLING CONTROL ACT WERE IN THEIR FORMATIVE STAGE. THAT LIMITED MORATORIUM HAS BEEN EXTENDED FROM NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TO CHECK THAT. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE AND NOW PROPOSED TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD MEAN EXPANSION FROM THREE YEARS NOW TO THIRTY YEARS. IF MEASURE REPRESENTS AN INTRUSION AGAINST LOCAL AUTHORITY THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE JUSTIFIED. MUCH OF THE ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT IS SIMPLY THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THINGS. UNPRECEDENTED TIMES IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS. WE ARE AWARE OF NO COMPELLING REASON HY THE CURRENT MORATORIUM ON LOCAL EXPANSION OF LEGAL GAMING OPERATIONS SHOULD BE EXPANDED YET AGAIN. REVENUE FROM THESE OPERATIONS COULD BRING SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL BENEFIT TO THE- ARTICULATELY IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC OF THE DESIRE TO GROW REVENUES AND EMPLOYMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THE REGIONAL REASONABLE FLEXIBILITY TO DO SO. FOR THESE REASONS THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES RESPECTFULLY URGES AND THEY'LL VOTE ON THE MEASURE. THANK YOU- I'M NOT SEEING.

IS ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IF YOU GET YOUR MIKE UP IF YOU COULD RAISE YOUR HAND TO BECAUSE THE CLERK CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER JUST TO COMMENT ON ON THIS BILL AND- HOW CALIFORNIA HANDLES GAMING OVERALL I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS. AS ONE OF THE CALLERS MENTIONED THAT OUR OUR RULES ARE ARE SOMEWHAT OUTDATED AND ARCHAIC- IT WITH THIS- I MEAN. LISTENING THE TESTIMONIAL FIND THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND ANY TWO PEOPLE AGREE ON ANYTHING RELATED TO GAME AND- BUT- GAMINE IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY LUCRATIVE BUT IT'S ALSO A VICE AND IT'S WELL KNOWN TO HAVE CERTAIN SOCIAL IMPACTS ARE- YOU KNOW KNOWN TO OF. HAVE A DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON CERTAIN MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY REQUIRES ITS ITS ITS HEAVY REGULATION- CALIFORNIA WAS DIVIDE IS A VERY DIVERSE STATE WE PRIDE OURSELVES OF HAVING SUCH A DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY THAT AGES MAKES US THE MOST PROSPEROUS BUT STATEMENT THE NATION. MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA I GUESS WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE NEVADA STYLE GAMING BUT THAT IS NOT CALIFORNIA I THINK CALIFORNIA REQUIRES. SOME LEVEL OF MODERATION IN THIS INDUSTRY. HOWEVER THERE'S ONE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IN THE THAT PROVIDES AT THE CITY COUNTY OR CITY. AND COUNTIES JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT MAY EXPAND. TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASE OF GAMING TABLES PERCENT TO THE SECTION. AND YOU KNOW I'M IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT IN A OPPOSED TO A PROCESS OF REEVALUATING. THE AMOUNT OF TABLES PER COUNTY BUT IT'S- PROVIDING THAT. A CITY OR COUNTY- MAY EXAMINE THAT AND FOR MEANT THAT I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH THAT IN A IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THIS DOES SO DIVERSE. IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT A MAP OF CALIFORNIA YOU'LL FIND. THAT WE HAVE SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE ENORMOUS BUT BARELY HAVE A FEW PEOPLE IN ON SOME THAT ARE VERY SMALL. EXTREMELY SMALL COUNTIES LIKE THE COUNTY OF ALPINE WITH HAS A THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE. WHOSE ENTIRE COUNTY- I MEAN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE ENTIRE COUNTY OF ALPINE IS OWNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS IS FEDERALLY OWNED LAND. YOU TAKE THAT AND YOU COMPARE THAT TO L. A. COUNTY. THAT IS- A FLOW OF MODERATELY SIZED COUNTY BUT WITH TEN MILLION PEOPLE. OR LOOK COMPARE THAT TO A VERY VERY SMALL COUNTY AS A SAN FRANCISCO WITH. A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH THAT IS CURRENTLY THE MOST DENSE PART OF OUR STATE. YOU SEE THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO DRAFT THE POLICY THAT- COVERS EVERY PART OF THE STATE AND IF YOU GIVE THE POWER TO THE LOCAL LEVEL TO REALLY. LEAD TO A OVER CONCENTRATION OF GAMING IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE VERSUS. OTHERS IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE CAME IN WILL HAVE. A MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE AND I THINK. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REQUIRES A POLICY THAT WILL. EQUALLY DISTRIBUTE. GAMING OR AT LEAST TO FIND A WAY TO ACTUALLY. MINIMIZE ITS NEGATIVE IMPACT AND MAXIMISE ITS ECONOMIC BENEFIT I THINK THERE'S A WAY. TO DO THAT AND WE HAVE A DOUBLE TIER SYSTEM I WAS HERE LAST TIME WE- ADVANCE THIS AND- AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT EVERY SINGLE TWO OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS WERE KICKING THE CAN DOWN. THE ROAD ON ON. EXAMINING HOW ARE STATE ISSUES THESE LICENSES HOW WE TREAT GAMING- WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRIBES THEY'RE REQUIRED TO COME INDIVIDUALLY AND GET A COMPACT TO VERY EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT PROCESS THAT REQUIRES LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY'RE THEY'RE SUBJECT TO THIS PROCESS WHICH SEEMS TO BE. STATUS QUO YEAR IN YEAR A YEAR AFTER YEAR AND- I THINK THIS BILL- I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL IT'S AN IMPORTANT MEASURE I THINK IT NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD I'M GONNA SUPPORTED TODAY. BUT OF I HATE TO OVERBURDEN THE AUTHOR AND ASK HIM TO COMPLETELY REDESIGN. THE PROCESS BUT AT LEAST IN THIS BILL WE SHOULD ADD A PROVISION THAT- THE- AS FOR A STUDY TO RE EXAMINE HOW WE APPROVE GAMING CALIFORNIA AND IF IT'S GOING TO INCREASE IT SHOULD INCLUDE THE THAT THE I DON'T THINK THE GAME ROOM SHOULD BE TREATED INDEPENDENTLY. OF THE TRIBES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE APPROVED AND HOW THEIR AUTHORIZED BECAUSE AS- AS WE'VE UP SEEING HOW WE APPROVED GAMING HERE THERE IS AND THERE JUST SEEMS TO BE ONE PROCESS. FOR THE TRIBES AT ANOTHER PROCESS FOR THE GAME AND FISH WHICH I THINK IS JUST PATENTLY UNFAIRNESS IS BASED ON. THE STATE'S. HISTORY OF TREATING PEOPLE SEPARATELY ON THE SPARE LEE. AND ANOTHER UNEQUALLY AND I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AND IT REALLY EVALUATE ITS IMPACT ON THE STATE AND WHETHER CERTAIN AREAS ARE HAVE AN OVER CONCENTRATION OR NOT. AND I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT NOW LOOKING AT THIS BILL HOPEFUL HOPING. THROUGH THE AUTHOR IN THIS AUTHORS COMMITTEES PRESENCE WE COULD PROVIDE MORE INPUT INTO THIS BILL INTO THIS PROCESS. THAT ONE THAT THAN WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY IS ON THE TABLE. THANK YOU AT CENTER HUESO JUDGES WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- IT'S A FEDERAL PROCESS THAT OUTLINES HOW WE DEAL WITH TRIBES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A. N. THESE BILLS- YOU KNOW OUR- INTERESTING THAT COME BEFORE US ALREADY SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SIX. YEARS I THINK THIS IS THE THIRD EXTENSION WE'VE SEEN SOME SHORT EXTENSIONS NOW WE'RE SEEING A WHOLE LOT LONGER EXTENSIONS. BUT IT'S A BALANCE BETWEEN SMALL CARD ROOMS MEDIUM SIZE LARGE IT ALSO THE NEEDS AND WANTS OF THE TRIBES AND ALSO THE NEEDS OF THE WANTS OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT. ANY GAMBLING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CENTER HUESO BACK TO YOU. I DO APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION I THINK WAS VERY NECESSARY BUT I JUST WANTED TO PUT MY COMMENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU SAID BURIED IN MIND THAT THERE ARE FEDERAL LAWS AND ALSO STATE LAWS. THERE SHOULD BE A WAY OF INCLUDING. AREAS OF CALIFORNIA INTO CERTAIN EITHER METROPOLITAN OR STATISTICAL AREA METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS TO CAPTURE. THE AMOUNT OF- POPULATION IN THOSE AREAS TO REALLY EVALUATE. AND BEARING IN MIND THAT THERE ARE OTHER RULES THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL STATE POLICY. TO REGULATE GAMING ACROSS THE STATE IN A WAY THAT'S THAT'S EQUITABLE WE COULD STILL. DETERMINE THAT CONSIDERING FEDERAL LAWS THAT EXIST THANK CENTER HUESO CENTER ALLEN DID YOU HAVE. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY ELSE COMMITTEE. SEEING THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER- COMMENTS- CENTER ARCHULETA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. OKAY WITH THAT DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON IT S. B.
