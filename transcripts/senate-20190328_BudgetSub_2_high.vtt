THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF RUST

BROWN WITH THE LA -- I'M GONNA

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.405
JUST GIVE A TRY TO GIVE A BRIEF

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.775
OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED CAP AND

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.809
TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:50.777
I'M GONNA KIND OF BREAK IT UP

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.011
INTO TWO DIFFERENT PARTS ONE

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.180
JUST A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.548
JUST THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.683
PLAN INCLUDING REVENUES AND

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.351
EXPENDITURES AND FUND BALANCES

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.286
IN KIND OF THE AMOUNT THAT MIGHT

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.654
BE AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURES IN.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.223
IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN TALK

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.158
ABOUT JUST SOME OF THE SPECIFICS

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.893
OF THE PROPOSED EXPENDITURES SO

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.894
TO START OFF.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.796
THE TOP LEVEL -- THE TABLE ON

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.664
PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA KINDA

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.132
GIVES YOU.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.301
A MORE DETAILED PICTURE OF

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.704
REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.339
FINE BALANCES -- THE

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.541
ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING TWO

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.009
POINT SIX BILLION IN REVENUE IN

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:25.011
THE CURRENT YEAR AND TWO POINT

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.279
ONE BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR --

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.947
AND IS PROPOSING A TWO POINT

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.149
FOUR BILLION DOLLAR -- SPENDING

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.251
PLAN AND THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.051
INCLUDING CONTINUOUS

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.153
APPROPRIATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.421
EXPENDITURES INCLUDING

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:36.890
DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.157
AND THAT WOULD LEAVE ACCORDING

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.993
THEIR PROJECTIONS ARE LESS THAN

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.960
ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FUND

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:45.131
BALANCE AT THE END OF THE YEAR

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.833
AT THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.668
WE'VE PROJECTS THAT'S REVENUE

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:49.569
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS OF

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:50.270
FLOWERS PRICES IN AUCTIONS

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.205
CONTINUE THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:53.373
BEEN AROUND AT THE FLOOR PRICE.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.375
REVENUE WILL BE ABOUT EIGHT

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.776
HUNDRED MILLION MORE THAN WHAT

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.212
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROJECTING

00:02:59.279 --> 00:02:59.946
OVER THE TWO YEARS.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:00.780
AND THEN AFTER YOU TAKE INTO

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.415
ACCOUNT THE AMOUNT THAT GOES TO

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:03.917
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS.

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.985
THAT WOULD LEAVE ROUGHLY FOUR

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:06.786
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN THE

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.755
FUND BALANCE AT THE END OF THE

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.423
BUDGET YEAR.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.424
THERE'S STILL QUITE A BIT OF

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:12.559
UNCERTAINTY.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.027
AROUND REVENUE AND SO WE DO

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.428
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:16.863
CAUTIOUS AND LEAVE SOME -- IN

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.264
THE FUND BALANCE AT THE END OF

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.766
THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.200
BUT EVEN UNDER UNDER OUR

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.368
PROJECTIONS EVEN IF THE

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:23.536
LEGISLATURE WHERE TO SPEND FOR

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.737
EXAMPLE A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.973
DOLLARS MORE WE STILL THINK THAT

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.143
WOULD LEAVE -- A HEALTHY RESERVE

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.344
IN THE FUND BALANCE.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.478
THE SECOND ISSUE I WANT TO GET

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.646
TO IS JUST THE MULTI YOUR

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.448
OUTLOOK ON SPENDING JUST KIND OF

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.117
LOOKING AT WHAT REVENUES MIGHT

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:39.752
BE AGAIN A MARKET CONDITIONS

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.220
CONTINUE THE WAY THEY ARE OVER

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.056
THE NEXT FEW YEARS -- WE PROJECT

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.457
REVENUE WOULD BE ROUGHLY IN THE

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.858
TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.560
RANGE AND SO THAT LEAVES FOR

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:49.662
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING --

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.331
SOMETHING CLOSE TO NINE HUNDRED

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.099
MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR THE

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.200
LEGISLATURE TO ALLOCATE IN

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.536
FUTURE YEARS REVENUE AGAIN STAYS

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.404
THE WAY THAT HAS BEEN -- SO WE

00:03:58.471 --> 00:03:59.639
JUST WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:00.440
WHEN YOU'RE KIND OF THINKING

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:01.908
ABOUT LONG TERM SPENDING YOU

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:02.709
KNOW ROUGHLY NINE HUNDRED

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.144
MILLION -- GOING FORWARD AND

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.012
THINKING ABOUT.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.280
WHEN YOU COMMIT TO KIND OF MULTI

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.948
YEAR SPENDING -- KIND OF KEEPING

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.416
THAT WILL TELL YOUR SPENDING

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:11.951
BELOW THAT AMOUNT -- THE

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:14.520
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS ROUGHLY

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:15.121
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND MULTI

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.556
YEAR SPENDING ON IT SO THAT IS

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:19.592
LOWER THAN.

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.127
THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.028
AND THEN FINALLY THE JUST A KIND

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:22.829
OF VERY A TECHNICAL ISSUE AROUND

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.297
THE THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.832
WHICH WOULD GIVE THE DEPARTMENT

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:27.400
OF FINANCE SOME AUTHORITY.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.234
TO REDUCE SOME OF THE

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.736
ALLOCATIONS OF REVENUE COMES AND

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:31.437
BELOW WHAT'S EXPECTED WE THINK

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.473
THAT'S A VERY -- A REASONABLE

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:34.874
APPROACH GENERALLY TO KIND OF

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.142
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.978
UNCERTAINTY AROUND REVENUE.

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.414
DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.915
AND AUTHORITIES HERE TO MAKE.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.150
SOME OF THOSE REDUCTIONS OTHER

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.585
PROGRAMS WOULD BE LEFT HOLE ONE

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:46.953
HIGHLIGHT THAT FOR YOU AND JUST

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.820
MAKE SURE.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.956
THAT THOSE -- KIND OF REDUCTIONS

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:52.358
pTHE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES SOME

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.826
OF THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.061
WHICH ONE SHOULD BE CAPITAL.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.863
SO WITH THAT I'LL JUST MOVE ON

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.064
TO A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.401
SPENDING PLAN ITSELF SO ON PAGE.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.670
SIX OF YOUR HAND OF YOUR AGENDA

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.271
EXCUSE ME HAS A TABLE.

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:08.307
OF THE PROPOSED SPENDING PLAN

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.410
AND A COMPARISON TO WHAT THE

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.245
EXPENDITURES WERE LAST YEAR NOT

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.946
GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE --

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:15.481
ALL THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS I

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.016
THINK JUST IN GENERAL IT'S

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.551
LARGELY CONTINUATION OF

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:20.253
PROVIDING FUNDS TO PROGRAMS THAT

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.488
HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH THREE G.

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:23.756
R. F. IN THE PAST.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:24.791
SOME OF THE AMOUNTS ARE A LITTLE

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.025
BIT LOWER THAT'S LARGELY --

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.294
REFLECTION OF THE LOWER EXPECTED

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.196
RESOURCES AND REVENUE THAT'S

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:34.734
AVAILABLE IN THE BUDGET YEAR --

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:35.368
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT AMOUNTS

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.235
FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS I THINK

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:36.903
ONE JUST A HIGHLIGHT I THINK

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:37.704
YOU'LL BE HEARING THAT IN THE

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.138
NEXT PART OF YOUR AGENDA THE

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:40.740
ONLY REAL KIND OF NEW PROGRAM

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:42.075
THAT'S BEING PROPOSED AS THE

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.476
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.546
PROPOSAL -- AND SO I WON'T.

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:49.182
TALK ABOUT THAT IN DETAIL BUT

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:50.583
JUST WANTED TO FLAG THAT FOR YOU.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.719
A COUPLE OF ISSUES TO CONSIDER

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:53.352
WHEN YOU'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.354
THE PLAN ONE IS FOR A LOT OF THE

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.389
PROPOSALS.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.490
BUT NOT A LOT OF DETAILED

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:58.558
INFORMATION ABOUT KIND OF WHAT

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.526
THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE FOR A

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:03.730
LOT OF THE AREAS OF FUNDING --

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:04.797
IN SOME CASES EVEN JUST KIND OF

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:05.765
A NUMBER OF PROJECTS WOULD BE

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.734
FUNDED BUT THEN ALSO EXPECTED

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.168
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS OR

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:10.603
OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS AND SO.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.637
WE THINK OR RECOMMEND THE

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:12.839
LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT THE

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:14.140
ADMINISTRATION TO GOT A REPORT

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.675
ON WHAT TO EXPECT SOME OF THOSE

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:16.576
OUTCOMES TO BE WE DO RECOGNIZE

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:16.776
THAT.

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:17.944
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE DIFFICULT

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.945
BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.747
YOU MAKING DECISIONS ON HOW TO

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.148
PRIORITIZE FUNDING AS WELL AS

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.316
KEEPING THE ADMINISTRATION

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:26.419
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY EXPECT

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:27.787
GOING FORWARD.

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:28.788
ANOTHER ISSUE WE DO WANT TO

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.323
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT SOME OF THE

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.558
PROGRAM SOME FOR SOME PROGRAMS

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.260
SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.695
MIGHT BE NEEDED IN THE BUDGET

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.096
YEAR UNDER THE PROPOSED.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:40.133
ALLOCATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE --

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.601
THEIR RESOURCES BOARD TWO

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.569
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.972
CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECTS --

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.340
PROPOSAL CONSISTENT WITH AN

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:48.541
ACTION THAT WAS ADOPTED LAST

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:50.376
YEAR IS TO PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:53.346
MILLION FOR THOSE REBATES --

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.148
UNDER SOME A CARBS RECENT

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.550
PROJECTIONS THE DEMAND FOR THOSE

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:58.851
REBATES WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.953
HIGHER THAN THAT -- IN THE

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.922
BUDGET YEAR AND SO THAT MIGHT

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.056
MEAN SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:05.158
PROGRAM WHAT ABOUT ME AND BE

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:06.192
SORT OF THE AMOUNT OF THE REBATE

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.160
OR WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:07.927
REBATE.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.028
AND SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.396
THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.063
KIND OF WHAT TYPES OF

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.532
ADJUSTMENTS THEY EXPECT TO MAKE

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:15.935
IN ORDER TO KIND OF STAY WITHIN

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.069
THE PROPOSED BUDGET AMOUNT.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.171
AND THEN FINALLY JUST MORE

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:19.705
GENERALLY -- WE JUST WE CONTINUE

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:20.907
TO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.942
ALLOCATE FUNDING TO ITS HIGHEST

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.210
PRIORITIES.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.044
WHICH YOU KNOW COULD BE

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:25.945
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.346
REDUCTIONS OTHER PRIORITIES WE

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:29.048
KNOW ARE RELATED TO REDUCING

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.449
LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS CLIMATE

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.185
ADAPTATION SO THINKING ABOUT

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:32.785
WHAT THOSE HIGHEST PRIORITIES

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:33.486
ARE.

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:34.954
AND ONCE THOSE ARE IDENTIFIED TO

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.389
THINKING ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMS

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:39.091
ACHIEVE THOSE MOST EFFECTIVELY

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:40.459
ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE WE'VE.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:41.160
BROUGHT A LOT OF COMMENTS IN THE

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:42.829
PAST AND HOW TO THINK ABOUT THAT

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:43.996
AND HOW SOME OF THE SPENDING

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:45.832
INTERACTS WITH OTHER REGULATORY

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.166
PROGRAM SO.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:48.000
IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO THINK

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:49.402
ABOUT THAT -- ONE OTHER THING WE

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:51.337
DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT AGAIN ON

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:51.904
THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE OF

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.941
THINGS -- THINKING ABOUT.

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.276
CALIFORNIA'S ROLE IN REDUCING

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:59.011
GREENHOUSE GASES GLOBALLY AND

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.279
GIVEN THAT RELIC CALIFORNIA IS A

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:02.982
RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:03.616
GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.518
THINK ABOUT -- WHICH PROGRAMS

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:06.853
ARE LIKELY TO KIND OF PROMOTE

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.487
EMISSION REDUCTION AND AND OTHER

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:13.259
JURISDICTIONS AS WELL SO WHETHER

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.394
THAT BE -- LOADING INNOVATION OR

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:15.962
NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAYBE

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:16.429
COULD BE.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:17.263
ADOPTED ANOTHER TO OTHER

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.165
JURISDICTIONS WHETHER THAT'S YOU

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:20.499
KNOW DEMONSTRATING SOME

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:21.767
PARTICULAR PROGRAM THAT MAYBE

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.236
OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE LIKELY

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:24.070
TO ADOPT.

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:24.871
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE DIFFICULT

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.706
THINGS TO ANALYZE BUT WE DO

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:27.573
THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO KEEP

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.541
IN MIND WE'RE KIND OF

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:29.675
CONSIDERING THE OVERALL PACKAGE

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:30.309
OF DIFFERENT.

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:33.346
STRATEGIES SO WITH THAT I'M

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.414
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:36.415
CAN YOU I'M YEAH WE'VE GOT MOST

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:37.316
OF US RECEIVE THIS ANNUAL REPORT

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.684
FROM THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD INTO

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.286
TALKING ABOUT THE APPROPRIATED

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.421
FUNDS AND IN THE ALLOCATED FUNDS

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:43.456
AND THEN THE SELECTED IN THE

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:43.923
WARD.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.358
WERE DEFENSE IN THE IMPLEMENT

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:47.226
IMPLEMENTED FUNDS SO WHILE WE

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.629
MAY SIT HERE IN SUB TO AND SAY

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.298
WE WANT.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.200
TO A LOT THIS MUCH MONEY.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:54.800
DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET SPEND IN

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.602
THE THE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:57.436
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF MONEY

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:58.137
THAT.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.639
I GUESS WE SAY IN THE PIPELINE

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.841
SO WELL WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:04.777
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT-THAT CONCERN AND WE MAY WANT TO

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:07.880
PUT IN LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS.

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.782
FINANCE TO PUT ON THE BRAKES.

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:11.384
JUST DISAPPEARS THE MEAN JUST ON

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.919
THE NATURAL THAT.

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.954
WE WOULD KNOW THE RESULTS OF

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.590
AUCTIONS IF WE OVER ANTICIPATED

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.326
OR OVER PROJECTED WELL BEFORE

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.261
ANYBODY'S WRITING CHECKS MY

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:25.431
WRONG ON THIS -- I MEAN I I

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.033
THINK FOR THE ALLOCATIONS THAT

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:30.436
HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE THEN YEAH

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.505
THERE THERE IS OFTEN TIMES SORT

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:33.773
OF A DELAY IN.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.041
GETTING THAT FINDING OUT THE

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:35.741
DOOR AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.510
PARTICULARLY NEW ONES TAKES

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:40.346
AWHILE TO GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR --

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.014

HELD AND SO YEAH I KNOW THEIR

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.622
APARTMENT A FINANCE REVIEWS

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.490
THOSE ESTIMATES ARE OFFICE

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:52.458

THOSE ESTIMATES AND SO.

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:58.764
PART OF IT CAN BE KIND OF A

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.366
CONVERSATION I THINK BETWEEN

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.500
BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:02.535
ADMINISTRATION.

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:03.469
DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.104
THAT THAT THAT -- WHATEVER

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.806
LANGUAGE IS KIND OF IN THE BILL

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:08.040
DOESN'T.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:08.941
NECESSARILY GIVE TOO MUCH

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.176
AUTHORITY OR IS IT OR MAKE SURE

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:11.377
THAT IT IS ALWAYS CONSISTENT

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.044
WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:13.579
PRIORITIES ARE I GUESS MY

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.514
CONCERN IS THAT YOU KNOW WE

IN ALL WAYS AND IF WE'RE

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.691
CAUTIOUS ON THE SPENDING OF

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:28.060
MONEY THAT WE HAVE AN AN AUCTION

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.228

I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR EIGHT

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:33.466
YEARS AND EVERY TIME THE

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:36.369
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION MADE A

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:37.837
BUDGET [inaudible]

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:38.637

I'VE WHAT ALL THE OPTIONS

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.480
PROJECTIONS TEND TO BE LOW BALL

I'D I'D.

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:50.349
I AGREE WITH YOUR ANALYSIS OF

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.684
THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.153
ADDITIONAL -- THERE THAT'S

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.890

TO GET THAT RIGHT BALANCE OF

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.630
LET'S GET THIS MONEY OUT AND

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:06.432
WHETHER IT'S ANOTHER HUNDRED

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.467
MILLION IN THE YOU KNOW -- CLEAN

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.002
CAR PROGRAM CASSETTES OVER

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:11.904
PRESCRIBED EVERY YEAR EVERY YEAR

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:12.972
WE KNOW THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.473
THAT WANT TO BUY THOSE THOSE

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.709
THINGS OR WHATEVER PROGRAM THAT

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:17.777
WE HAVE THAT WILL REDUCE

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:18.944
GREENHOUSE GASES.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.714
WILL RECEIVE THE ACTUAL BENEFIT

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:22.982
IF THAT.

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:24.683
ASIAN MARKETS DONE SO.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.085
DO YOU SEE THE THE STRUGGLE THAT

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.653
I'M HAVING WITH WITH TRYING TO

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.555
SAY BE CAUTIOUS BUT ALSO BE

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.590
AMBITIOUS.

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:33.225
ABSOLUTELY AND I'M NOT THAT'S

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:34.527
CLEARLY A STRUGGLE IN AND I

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:37.363
THINK WE DO THINK THAT THERE --

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.898
WILL LIKELY BEES -- SOME

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:40.433
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT -- THE

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:42.234
LEGISLATURE COULD IF IT'S IF IT

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:43.402
WANTS TO GET MONEY OUT TO DOLE

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:44.670
OUT THE DOOR SOONER COULD

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.338
POTENTIALLY ALLOCATED THIS YEAR

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:47.673
WHILE STILL HAVE BEEN KIND OF

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.075
TAKING A CAUTIOUS APPROACH AS

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.976
WELL AND HAVING AN ADEQUATE FUND

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:51.510
BALANCE BUT IT'S YOU KNOW

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.245
THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO MAGIC

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:54.413
ANSWER I DON'T THINK I'M KIND OF

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.648
HOW TO BALANCE THAT RISK OF OF

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:56.949
INSURING THAT THERE'S FISCAL

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.584
STABILITY BUT ALSO TRYING TO GET.

00:11:58.651 --> 00:11:59.718
MONEY OUT THE DOOR AS SOON AS

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:00.953
POSSIBLE AND SO THAT THAT'S JUST

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.123
A MATTER OF OF RISK IN TRYING TO

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.490
EVALUATE THAT.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.192
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THE

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:10.162
CURRENT -- PRICE OF THE

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:13.999
ALLOWANCES BECAUSE I I SAW IN

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.134
THE REPORT THAT CAR PUT OUT.

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:17.403
THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT A

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.274
SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR FOR TIME AND

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:25.344
BUT HOW THE DAVE OF PHRASES.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.847
THE CARD HE WORKED WITH THE

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.915
APPLICATION OF OF OF ALL THE

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:31.750
PROGRAMS COMES OUT TO BE.

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.252
ABOUT A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR PER

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:35.054
TON.

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:37.256
COSTS FOR WHETHER IT'S METHANE

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.158
REDUCTIONS ARE PRESCRIBED BURNS

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:42.261
WHATEVER WAS IN THE AUCTION IS

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:44.096
NORTH OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS -- IT

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.331
SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:46.799
DISCONNECTION THERE HOW DOES THE

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:50.669
LA -- REVIEW THAT.

00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:52.238
I MEAN I I THINK OUR GENERAL

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:54.573
VIEW IS THAT YOU KNOW RELYING ON

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.742
SORT OF THE PRICE GIVEN THROUGH

00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:59.712
ALLOWANCES IS -- LIGHT AND MANY

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:01.013
CASES THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.248
WAY TO KIND OF ENCOURAGE THOSE

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.283
REDUCTIONS IN SO RIGHT NOW AS

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.884
YOU HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.018
PRICE AND THE CAP AND TRADE

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:07.853
MARKET IS MUCH LOWER THAN SOME

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.721
OF THE ESTIMATED.

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.189
COST PER GREENHOUSE GAS

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:11.624
REDUCTIONS -- THROUGH THE

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.192
SPENDING SIDE OF THINGS AND SO

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:14.560
WE WE DO THINK SORT OF RELYING

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.762
ON THE PRICE SIGNAL GIVEN

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.030
THROUGH THOSE ALLOWANCE PRICES

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.231
IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.900
GENERALLY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:21.700
GAS EMISSIONS.

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:23.102
NOW WITH THAT SAID THAT THERE

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:25.871
ARE CERTAINLY OTHER AREAS AND

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:27.206
OTHER REASONS TO KIND OF SPEND

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:27.973
MONEY ON DIFFERENT THINGS AND

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.843
SOME OF THOSE. FOR EXAMPLE ARE

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.078
YOU EVEN -- WITH AID YOU KNOW

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.380
HIRE -- ALLOWANCE PRICE FOR

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.748
EXAMPLE THERE MIGHT NOT BE SORT

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.082
OF QUITE ENOUGH INNOVATION AND

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:38.250
NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND IT DOESN'T

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.752
QUITE SEND THAT SIGNAL AND SO

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:40.653
THERE'S OTHER TYPES OF NO

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:41.620
COMMENTS REFER TO THESE AS

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.022
MARKET FAILURES WHERE YOU KNOW

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:43.923
THAT THERE MIGHT BE A A STATE

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:44.823
ROLLING KIND OF USING.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.525
FUNDS TO PROMOTE THOSE TYPES OF

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.526
THINGS AND SO THAT'S ONE

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:48.994
CONSIDERATION WHEN THINKING

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:49.862
ABOUT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:53.332
THEY TARGETED AT THOSE TYPES OF

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.669
OF BENEFITS AND I THINK ANOTHER --

00:13:56.735 --> 00:14:02.474
ANOTHER ISSUE IS YOU KNOW A LOT

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:03.309
OF THESE PROGRAMS I THINK ARE.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:03.876
AT LEAST PARTIALLY TARGETED

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:04.877
LOCAL AIR POLLUTION AND SO ON

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:05.444
THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE THEY

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.078
MIGHT NOT BE AS SORT OF COST

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:07.379
EFFECTIVE AS SOME OF THE OTHER

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:09.348
APPROACHES BUT THE GOAL FOR SOME

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.883
OF THEM IS TO ACHIEVE SOME OF

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.483
THESE OTHER BENEFITS AND SO

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.284
TRYING.

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:12.985
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.720
GOOD HANDLE ON UNDERSTANDING AND

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.288
INFORMATION ON THE DEGREE TO

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:17.423
WHICH IT IS ACHIEVING SOME OF

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:18.757
THOSE OTHER BENEFITS AS WELL AN

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:20.226
SORT OF TRYING TO EVALUATE THAT

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.060
AND WEIGH THAT AGAINST WHAT

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:21.760
MIGHT BE.

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.696
A DIFFERENCE IN COST COMPARED TO

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:25.264
SOME OTHER POLICIES WE'VE BEEN

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:26.832
TRYING TO FOLLOW YOUR ADVICE

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.033
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.802
EXPENDITURE PLAN IS ONLY SPENT

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:31.403
ON NON COVERED ENTITIES VERSUS

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.905
COVERED ENTITIES IN THE EARLY

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:34.073
DAYS WE WERE.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.574
WE WERE WE WERE.

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.409
AUCTIONING -- POLLUTION

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.845
ALLOWANCES AT A LOW PRICE WE ARE

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:41.580
GIVING OUT FREE ALLOWANCES ON

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:44.049
TOP OF IT FOR IN OUR AMBITION TO

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:44.917
SMOOTH THINGS OUT.

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:46.885
AND AND THEN WE WERE ACTUALLY

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:48.587
HELPING OUT COVERED ENTITIES WHO

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:49.822
ARE ALREADY PARTICIPATING AND

00:14:49.888 --> 00:14:50.990
AND THE AUCTION WE DIDN'T

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.458
SEGREGATE THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:53.292
GIVING THESE.

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:55.761
THESE PROCEEDS THERE IF YOU HAVE

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.930
IF YOU HAVE AN OVER ALLOTMENT OF

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.632
FREE ALLOWANCES ARE OUT THERE

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:00.933
CURRENTLY AND IF YOU HAVE A

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.403
CRISIS IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.472
AND HOW WOULD. ONE THING HERE WE

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:07.640
HEAR HIMSELF TO WE WANT TO SPEND

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:09.108
THE MONEY I GET I GET THAT

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:11.043
THAT'S WHAT WE DO BUT IF WE WANT

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.511
TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.513
IF IT ISN'T IT BETTER TO GET

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.315
THAT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR PRICE

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:18.617
CLOSER TO WHAT THE WHAT THE

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:20.286
ALLOWANCE PRICES TO THAT THE

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.554
COVERED ENTITIES WOULD BE

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:25.824
CHOOSING. TO TO THE INVESTMENT

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:28.460
RATHER THAN TO BUY THE ALLOWANCE

00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:29.094
OR GET THE FREE ALLOWANCE TO MY

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:29.495
NOT.

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:31.063
FOLLOWING YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.631
NOW WE HAVE A REPORT THAT THIS

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.633
IS WHAT WE'RE SPENDING AGAIN

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.135
SOME OF ITS VERY HIGH SOME OF

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:41.173
IT'S SLOW BUT BUT THE BLENDED

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.575
RATE.

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:45.678
I MEAN I I THINK.

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:47.880
V. OUR VIEW IS IS.

00:15:47.946 --> 00:15:48.681
I THINK -- CLEAR FOCUS SHOULD BE

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:50.449
ON MAKING SURE THAT THE CAP AND

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:51.750
TRADE PROGRAM KIND OF IN THE

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.352
NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:54.820
ISSUED AND DISTRIBUTED.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.822
IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE THE

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.223
GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.025
LAID OUT AND WE THINK IT'S IT'S

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:01.894
THAT'S DONE -- IF THAT'S DONE

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.662
WELL THEN THE ALLOWANCE PRICES

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:04.930
WILL KIND OF PROVIDE THAT TYPE

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:05.531
OF SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:07.700
ABOUT FOUR COVERED ENTITIES AND

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.134
BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS TO

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.102
MAKE THOSE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.470
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE.

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:13.105
AND SO -- YOU KNOW MAKING SURE

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:14.340
THAT THAT THAT KIND OF THAT

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.874
PROGRAM IS SET UP IN A WAY

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:16.709
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:18.577
LEGISLATURE'S GOALS IS IS VERY

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:19.578
IMPORTANT AND THEN YOU'RE

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:20.779
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO HOW

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:22.214
TO WRAP AROUND SOME OF THE THE

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.882
EXPENDITURES AND OTHER POLICIES

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:26.652
AROUND THAT -- IT IS KIND OF THE

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:27.753
NEXT IMPORTANT STEP AS WELL SHE

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.988
PASSES TO PRIORITIZE OUR FUNDING

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:31.490
PROPOSALS AND LET AND LOOK AT

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:32.891
THE OUTCOMES AND WE'VE ALWAYS.

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.360
TALK ABOUT THE BIGGEST BANG FOR

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:35.561
THE BUCK.

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:37.463
BUT IF WE IF WE KNEW THAT

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:38.797
COVERED ENTITIES WERE MAKING

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.733
INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE THE

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.234
POLLUTION RATHER THAN YOU KNOW

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:44.002
WITH THE LAST REPORT WE GOT FROM

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.237
THE AIRPORT WAS THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:46.572
DRIVING MORE MILES.

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:47.373
YOU KNOW THE POLLUTION IS

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:49.141
ACTUALLY GOING UP AND THEN WE

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:51.210
HAVE A FOREST FIRE INCIDENTS

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:52.378
WHICH WHICH AREN'T EVEN

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:58.117
CALCULATED IN OUR IN OUR

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:58.384
COVERAGE.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.918
IT'S IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT ON A

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:00.586
GOOD DAY IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:01.220
DIFFICULT TO TRY TO PRIORITIZE

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.988
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MARKET

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:04.656
RATE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:06.458
WORKING OUT THERE THIS IS.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.093
A SIXTY DOLLAR.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.062
DISTANCE RIGHT IF IT WERE CLOSER

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.530
THAN IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:12.798
TASK FOR US TO SAY.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:13.966
WE'RE GONNA PUTS MORE MONEY AND

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:50.796
CAP AND TRADE PROCEEDS -- SO AS

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:53.398
FAR AS THE OCEAN THE COASTLINE.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.934
WE ARE FUNDING [inaudible]

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:57.636
RIGHT SO.

00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:59.104
I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:00.472
THAT WE ARE FOR THE SUM OF OUR

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:02.975
PROPOSITION FUNDING.

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.177
COASTAL CONSERVANCY IS IS ONE OF

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.912
THE RECIPIENTS -- THAT YOU

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.047
MENTION I JUST THINK AS WE MOVE

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:11.650
FORWARD TO HAVE A MORE HOLISTIC

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.452
APPROACH IN AGAIN BEST

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.921
INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE THE

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:18.090
OBJECTIVES.

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:19.391
OCEAN SHOULD BE PART OF IT.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.793
THAT'S MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.896
QUESTION THANKS [inaudible]

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:25.464
EARN.

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:27.165
THANK YOU FOR LETTING INDULGING

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:29.935
ME JUST AT THE HIGH HIGH LEVEL --

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.037
BEYOND ANY PARTICULAR CATEGORY

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:32.671
ONE TO SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THE

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:33.272
CHAIRS.

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:34.973
POINT IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.042
PURPOSE IN STRATEGY BEHIND THAT

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:38.877
THE PLAN BROUGHT FORWARD TO US

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:43.348
AND AT THE DRIVING PIECES I

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.550
DON'T THINK SHOULD BE COST

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:46.818
EFFECTIVENESS ON A DOLLAR PER

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:48.453
TON BASIS I THINK THAT'S THE THE

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.689
WRONG STRATEGY FOR THIS TYPE OF

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:53.125
CAPITAL -- WHERE?

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.693
THE CARBON PRICES REALLY DRIVING

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.694
THE COST EFFECTIVE REDUCTIONS

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:57.029
BUT THIS GREENHOUSE GAS

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:58.864
REDUCTION FUND IS A PLACE TO ME

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.799
TO BE PATH BREAKING IN CREATIVE

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:01.433
SO.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.468
JUST BOTH FROM THE F. AND FROM

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:05.370
FROM LA -- HOW DO YOU LOOK AT

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:06.905
THE SORT OF [inaudible]

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:09.074
INNOVATION.

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:11.109
IN EFFICACY OR IS IT LIKE THAT

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:12.911
THAT METRIC OF HOW MUCH ARE WE

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:14.012
ACTUALLY.

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:16.281
STIMULATING INNOVATION IN THIS

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:17.349
STATE SO WE CAN SORT OF BE

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.217
BIGGER THAN WE ARE MAYBE I JUST

00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:20.619
TRY TO GET A SENSE OF THAT MAYBE

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:21.587
START WITH THE F. AND THEN COME

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:23.288
UP TO LA -- IS THAT IS THAT

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:25.357
METRIC A MEANINGFUL ONE TO YOU

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:27.192
ALL THESE AT THE END NONE

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.727
LOOKING FOR SORT OF THE THESIS

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.228
HERE AT LEAST OF WHAT IS DRIVING

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:32.264
YOUR STRATEGY.

00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:34.232
RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR DOWNTURN --

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:36.435
THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR THE CAP

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:37.536
AND TRADE FUNDS AND WE WOULD

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:40.439
AGREE WE WANT TO LOOK AT A LOT

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.273
OF THE CO BENEFITS.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.842
NOT JUST GHG EMISSION REDUCTION

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.844
BUT SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.947
SOME OF THE POLLUTANT MATERIAL --

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:53.518
REDUCTIONS -- FUEL REDUCTION

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:57.389
WHICH DOES THAT DOESN'T DIRECTLY.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:58.290
EIGHT TWO MAYBE.

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:00.792
GHG REDUCTIONS BUT IF THE

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:02.461
REFINERIES DON'T.

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:05.330
NEED TO PRODUCE AS MUCH IN AN IN

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:06.798
AN INDIRECT WAY IT WILL.

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:09.001
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:12.204
THINGS WE ALSO ARE -- MEETING A

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.406
LOT OF THE FUNDING IN

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:15.941
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.743
INCOME YOU LOW INCOME

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.578
COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:21.146
HOUSEHOLDS.

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:24.983
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT --

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.385
NOT CRITERIA BUT A LOT OF

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:29.454
DIFFERENT POINTS OF VALUE. TO

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:31.823
HOW THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED AND

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.592
IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO POINT

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:36.128
OUT AT A HIGH LEVEL WHAT THE

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:37.629
ANNUAL REPORT.

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:39.531
WILL POINT OUT CORRECT THAT WAS

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:40.966
THAT WAS RELEASED EARLIER THIS

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:41.967
WEEK.

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:43.769
THAT NINE POINT THREE BILLION

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:47.205
DOLLARS HAS BEEN -- APPROPRIATED

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:48.540
IN FUNDING FOR PROJECTS THAT

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:51.710
FACILITATE THE GHG REDUCTIONS.

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:53.478
AND SUPPORT A VARIETY OF STATE

00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:54.980
PRIORITIES.

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.481
SO THOSE INCLUDE LOW CARBON

00:21:56.548 --> 00:21:58.917
TRANSPORTATION WILDFIRE

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.018
PREVENTION.

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.420
JOBS.

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.789
COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION AND

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:06.658
CLIMATE RESILIENCY.

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:08.527
ADMINISTERING AGENCIES HAVE

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:09.995
IMPLEMENTED THREE POINT FOUR

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:12.130
BILLION DOLLARS TO CARRY OUT AN

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:14.266
ESTIMATED THIRTY SIX POINT FIVE

00:22:14.332 --> 00:22:16.234
MILLION TONS OF GHG EMISSIONS

00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:17.169
REDUCTION.

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:19.304
AND THAT IS JUST THE G. H. T.

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:21.173
ASIDE FROM ALL OF THE OTHER CO

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:24.176
BENEFITS -- THE INVESTMENTS ARE

00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:26.044
HELPING PRIORITY POPULATIONS

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:27.679
WHICH WE IDENTIFIED AS

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:30.449
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:32.451
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LOW

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:37.289
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. 57% OF THE

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:39.157
IMPLEMENTED FAN FUNDING HAS

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:40.659
BENEFITED THE PRIORITY

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.894
POPULATIONS WITH 36% OF THE

00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:44.429
IMPLEMENTED FUNDING LOCATED

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:47.299
WITHIN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:50.202
SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO TARGET.

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:54.306
A LOT OF THE INVENTOR WELL THE

00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:55.674
INVESTMENTS HAVE MET AND

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:57.008
EXCEEDED.

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:59.144
THE INVESTMENTS MINIMUMS THAT

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:01.413
HAVE BEEN SET FORTH IN.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.716
AB FIFTEEN FIFTY AN SP.

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:06.451
FIVE THIRTY FIVE THE REPORT ALSO

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:08.053
INCLUDES STATISTICS.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.488
FROM THE GROWING INFORMATION ON

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.289
THE KOBE AND IF IT'S THAT WE'VE

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.157
TALKED ABOUT.

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.359
THE ANNUAL REPORT ALSO PROVIDES

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:15.927
OUTCOMES.

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:17.929
FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:23:17.996 --> 00:23:18.864

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.098
IMPLEMENTED.

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:22.667
SO FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF THE

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:23.235
HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN MILLION

00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:25.237

REPLACEMENTS.

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:30.509
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:31.409
POINT THREE MILLION HAS BEEN A

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:34.179
WAR WELL. THIRTEEN POINT TWO

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.914
MILLION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:38.150
WITH TEN THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:40.619
GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS ONE

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:42.320
POINT EIGHT MILLION POUNDS OF

00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:43.622
KNOX REDUCTIONS.

00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:45.657
OVER NINETY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS

GALLONS AND FUEL REDUCTION. 73%

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:55.100
OF THE FUNDS WERE IN

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:57.969
DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:06.945
OUT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:24:07.012 --> 00:24:08.680
FIFTEEN MILLION ALLOCATED

00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:10.115
HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN POINT FOUR

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:13.585
MILLION IMPLEMENTED IN.

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.821
TWENTY EIGHTEEN RESULTS IN SIXTY

PARTICULATE MATTER.

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.037
REDUCTIONS.

00:24:32.103 --> 00:24:33.371
SO.

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.106
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:24:35.173 --> 00:24:36.808
EXACTLY THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:39.177
TABLES IN THERE AND THEY ALL

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:45.483
SHOW DIFFERENT -- THAT WE CAN

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.985
LOOK AT THINGS.

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:48.386
AND AND IT IS A MATTER OF

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:49.921
BALANCING.

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.289
OUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT.

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:54.593
BENEFITS NOT JUST GHG BUT

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:55.994
BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITIES

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:57.729
BENEFITS YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING

00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:59.664
SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGED

00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:01.733
COMMUNITIES ARE HIT HARDER.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.668
AND WE WANT TO ADDRESS A LOT OF

00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:06.538
THE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:09.140
ISSUES AS WELL AND WE'RE USING

00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:11.309
THIS AS A MECHANISM TO DO THAT.

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:13.778
TO THE TUNE OF 57%.

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:14.579
MISTER BROWN YOU HAVE SOMETHING

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:15.447
THAT.

00:25:15.513 --> 00:25:17.415
YEAH I MEAN I I THINK.

00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:19.084
IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.118
AND AND FROM OUR VIEW IS SORT OF

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.720
A VERY REASONABLE WAY TO KIND OF

00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:23.054
THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY

00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:25.624
PRIORITIZING FUNDS AROUND YOU

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.225
KNOW TO ACHIEVE IN THE THE

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:28.560
BIGGEST IMPACT ON GREENHOUSE

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.228
GASES SORT OF THINKING ABOUT YOU

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:31.329
KNOW HOW TO PROMOTE INNOVATION.

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:32.764
HERE TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT KIND

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:34.366
OF HOW TO HOW TO DO THAT.

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:35.667
I THINK THE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:36.701
INNOVATION IS I THINK AN

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:38.536
INHERENTLY A VERY DIFFICULT

00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:40.038
THING TO QUANTIFY.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:41.907
AND TRYING TO THINK THROUGH WHAT

00:25:41.973 --> 00:25:43.141
IS THE STATE'S ROLE IN KIND OF

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.376
THE PROMOTING THAT INNOVATION

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:45.677
PARTICULARLY AMONG SORT OF THE

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:46.878
PRIVATE SECTOR WHETHER THAT BE

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:47.946
KIND OF EARLY.

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:50.081
STAGE RESEARCH OR SOMETHING KIND

00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:50.982
OF FURTHER DOWN THE LINE MAYBE

NEAR DEPLOYMENT OF KIND OF NEWER

00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:58.490
TECHNOLOGIES COMMERCIALLY -- I

00:25:58.556 --> 00:25:59.791
DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE SORT OF

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:01.092
A GREAT ANSWER ON KIND OF WHERE

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:02.527
EXACTLY.

00:26:02.594 --> 00:26:05.196
IN THAT KIND OF PIPELINE THE

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:07.132
THAT THE STATE CAN KIND OF BEST

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:08.266
SPEND ITS RESOURCES I KNOW YOU

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.467
KNOW -- YOUR SENATE OFFICE OF

00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:11.303
RESEARCH HAS RECENTLY DONE QUITE

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.738
A BIT OF WORK ON THIS -- WE

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:14.739
DEFINITELY THINK IT'S KIND OF

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:16.074
THE THE RIGHT TYPE OF QUESTION

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:17.709
TO BE KIND OF ASKING AND AND

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:19.577
THINKING ABOUT -- ON KIND OF HOW

00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:20.178
TO USE THIS MONEY TO KIND OF

00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:22.314
PROMOTE THAT TYPE OF INNOVATION

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.882

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:25.583
INTO KINDA TRYING TO EVALUATE

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.818
THAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT I DO

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:31.690
THINK IT'S KIND OF AN INHERENTLY

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:32.324
VERY DIFFICULT THING.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:33.024

TO HELP US SORT OF THINK THROUGH.

00:26:49.908 --> 00:26:52.510
HOW DO WE PUNCH BEYOND OUR UP

00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:54.145
ABOVE OUR WAIT HERE FROM

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:55.981
INNOVATION PERSPECTIVE HOW DO WE

00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:58.116
ACTUALLY SHOW THAT WE'RE WE'RE

00:26:58.183 --> 00:27:01.987

ADVANCEMENTS IN OUR IN OUR

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:04.255
APPROACH TO GREENHOUSE GAS

00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:05.390
REDUCTIONS NOT JUST OF BUYING

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:06.958
DOWN THE LOWEST CONCEPT FOR

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:08.893
SPREADING IT OUT TO ALL THE

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.096
VARIOUS POLITICAL CONSTITUENCIES

00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:12.831
THAT CARE ABOUT THIS MONEY LIKE.

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:13.965
DOING SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:16.134
A LITTLE BOLDER AND A LITTLE

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:17.469
FARTHER REACHING.

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:18.937
IF YOU IF YOU CAN START TO THINK

00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:19.904
ABOUT THAT THE FACT THAT

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:21.172
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ISN'T

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:23.008
EVEN IN HERE AND WAS WAS TAKEN

00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:24.642
DOWN AND I DON'T KNOW IF AGAIN

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:25.977
MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.479
INTERVENTION POINT.

00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:29.748
BUT UNDERLYING THAT I DON'T WANT

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:30.949
TO CONCEDE THAT INVESTING IN

00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:33.551
INNOVATION IS IGNORING INJUSTICE.

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:34.886
THE GREATEST THING YOU CAN DO

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:35.920
FOR EQUITY IS BRING DOWN THE

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:37.589
COST OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND

00:27:37.655 --> 00:27:38.490
DELIVER THEM THESE COMMUNITIES

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:09.687
ARE.

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.222
EIGHT JUST ON THE NORTH COAST.

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:14.692
MOSTLY SMALL FAMILY FARMERS

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.294
THREE HUNDRED HEADER CAL OR LESS.

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:18.363
NOW WHEN IT COMES TO DIGEST

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:19.997
RESEARCH TWELVE APPLICANTS THIS

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:24.302
YEAR FIVE OR SIX TO PREVIOUS.

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:26.404
I SAY ALL THIS IS IF WE ARE

00:33:26.471 --> 00:33:28.139
SERIOUS ABOUT FOCUSING ON

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:29.674
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:32.210
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO BE SERIOUS

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:34.379
ABOUT AGRICULTURE.

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:35.747
ON THE NORTH COAST WE HAVE JUST

00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:37.882
TAKEN A HUGE HIT BY THE SEVERE

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:40.418
CUT IN THE DUNGEONS CRAB SEASON

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.019
THAT USED TO GO FROM NOVEMBER

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:43.821
ALL THE WAY TO JULY.

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:45.456
IN A COURT SETTLEMENT THAT IS

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.692
NOT GONNA BE CUT OFF TO APRIL.

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.293
AT LEAST ON THE NORTH COAST.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.228
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:51.796
SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DRIVERS

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:52.830
THAT RULE COASTAL COMMUNITIES

00:33:52.897 --> 00:33:54.532
HAVE THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:55.800
LEVELS OF POVERTY.

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.168
WHAT'S LEFT IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:58.536
TIMBER [inaudible]

00:33:58.603 --> 00:33:59.871
VERY [inaudible]

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:02.540
IN MARIJUANA.

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:05.143
SO WHAT WE KNOWIS.

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.545
AT A LOSS FOR ECONOMIC DRIVERS.

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:08.980
WE ARE SEEN RECORD NUMBERS OF

00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:10.848
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FARM

00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:12.216
CANNABIS FOR YEARS.

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:13.718
UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE COSTS

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:15.520
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM THAT

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:17.455
WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE A PROP.

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:18.589
SIXTY FOUR NUMBER TWO WERE SEEN

00:34:18.656 --> 00:34:20.391
A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:23.227
SEASON FOUR ROLE CALIFORNIANS IN

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:26.097
REGARDS TO CRAP. THREE WHEN IT

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:28.299
COMES THE DAIRY WE HAVE TOLD

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:29.167
EVERYONE YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:29.767
THE LAW.

00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:31.369
WE PROVIDED THEM INCENTIVES TO

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:32.837
BE ALE TO MOVE FORWARD ON

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:34.138
INVESTING IN DOING THE RIGHT

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:35.506
THING REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:36.974
EMISSIONS AND NOW WE'RE ABOUT TO

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:39.577
TAKE IT BACK.

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:41.245
IN EVERYTHING I HEAR FROM THIS

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:42.580
LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:43.681
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND RIGHTFULLY

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:46.784
SO WE ARE ABOUT CREATING EQUITY

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.719
IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE.

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:50.221
SO FOR SERIOUS ABOUT GREEN

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:51.189
EQUITY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:53.191
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:55.059
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:58.229
HIT PEROT CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.730
GOING TO YANK THE CARPET.

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:01.165
UNDER FROM UNDERNEATH THESE

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:03.367
DAIRY FARMERS FOR DOING THE

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:04.569
RIGHT THING.

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.103
BUT YET CAN'T ACCOMPLISH WITH

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.573
INCENTIVE SO I'M IN INDEED THERE

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.241
AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE.

00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:11.409
TO GET SOME TO SEE IF WE CAN

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.077
HAVE SOME DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.612
KNOWING THAT IS THE MOST

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:17.715
EFFECTIVE WAY TO BE ABLE -- TO

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:20.184
REDUCE GHGS AND THE THIRD MOST

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:22.286
EFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:23.087
PRICE [inaudible]

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:27.558
FOR TEN MISS.

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:31.295
MORE -- ZOOMING I BELIEVE THAT

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.363
ONE OF THE CHARTS THAT WE'RE

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.131
LOOKING AT OUTCOMES THAT

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:35.533
SENATORS REFERRING TO IS THAT.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.301
THE COST PER GREENHOUSE GAS

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:39.904
REDUCTIONS IN DOLLARS PER METRIC

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.306
TON FOR THE DERRY DIGEST IS IS

00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:45.710
THAT NINE DOLLARS -- AND THE THE

00:35:45.776 --> 00:35:47.211
ALTERNATIVE NEWER MANAGEMENT IS

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:50.414
IT FORTY THREE DOLLARS WE'RE

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:51.315
TRYING TO LOOK.

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:53.117
ESSENCE OF HIS.

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:54.452
QUESTION DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:54.752
[inaudible]

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:57.221
RESPONSE.

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:59.557
THERE'S A LOT THERE.

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:01.492
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GO OVER

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:06.297
ALL OF THE NUMBERS AND AND GET

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:11.402
SOME AMOUNT OF FRAMEWORK MOVING

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:12.970
FORWARD IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.472
BABYSIT.

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:18.643
AGAIN ON THE COST OF THE MOST

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:22.380
BANG FOR OUR BUCK -- BUT AGAIN

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:24.382
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE IN THE

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:25.883
PROCESS OF REVIEWING.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.620
AND AS IS HAS DONE IN THE PAST

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.188
WE REVIEW ALL OF THE G. P. AS

00:36:31.255 --> 00:36:33.624
FAR AS THE AUCTION PROCEEDS.

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:35.860
BEYOND WHAT MAY BE AVAILABLE

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.628
WILL BE DOING THAT THROUGH THE

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:40.665
MAY REVISE PROCESS -- AND

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:42.199
ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR POINT I WOULD

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.801
NEED TO GET WITH I WOULD NEED TO

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:47.772
HAVE THE CDFA.

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:48.739
HI I WAS A HOME OF THE TWO

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:50.207
PIECES BASED OFF OF THE

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:51.409
INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS.

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:55.012
FROM THE HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW IS

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:55.713
THAT.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.248
THE DERRY DIGESTED PROGRAMS THE

00:36:57.315 --> 00:37:01.352
STATE'S MOST EFFECTIVE REDUCTION

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:02.320
WHEN IT COMES A CO.

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:02.987
TWO AND THE THIRD MOST EFFECTIVE

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.355
CLIMATE PROGRAM OUT OF THE FORTY

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:04.956
EIGHT THEY'RE CURRENTLY BEING

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:06.424
FUNDED [inaudible]

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.125
I'M.

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:09.160
AND IT'S BASED OFF OF THE

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:10.661
FORMULA THAT AT THE CHURCH HE

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:12.897
SAID SO I'M JUST REACTING TO

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:14.732
WHAT IS CURRENTLY WITHIN THE

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:16.367
BUDGET THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING.

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:17.969
IN ALL I'M SAYING I PROMISE ALL

00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:19.570
OF STOPPED AND I JUST WANNA TELL

00:37:19.637 --> 00:37:21.105
YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR YOUR

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:22.873
WORK AND THIS IS NOT PERSONAL

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.575
WHEN IT COMES TO YOU SO I JUST

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:25.276
WANNA MAKE SURE.

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:29.447
BUT AT ALL -- AND I JUST WANT TO

00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:32.083
SHARE THE FRUSTRATION FOR BASING

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:35.853
OUR DECISIONS OFF OF DATA.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.254
AND IT SHOULD BE NEAR THE TOP.

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.589
I THINK ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:41.058
PIECE THAT WE LOOK AT AND IT'S

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:42.293
ALSO INCLUDE.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.830
SOMEWHAT IN THE IN THE REPORT.

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:47.565
IS.

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:51.135
LEV USING SOME OF THE THE CAP

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:53.904
AND TRADE PROCEEDS. TO LEVERAGE

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:56.774
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AS WELL SO

00:37:56.841 --> 00:38:00.478
WHILE IT MAY LOOK LIKE IT'S A

00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:03.414
REDUCTION OVERALL TO THE PROGRAM.

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:04.749
AND THAT'S WHY I NEED TO GET ALL

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:06.917
OF THE PIECES TOGETHER -- IT'S

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.853
NOT NECESSARILY A REDUCTION IT

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:11.555
MAY BE A REDUCTION IN GHG I MEAN.

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.724
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:16.160
BUT THERE ARE OTHER FUNDS THAT

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:17.028
ARE THAT ARE ALSO SUPPORTING.

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:20.331
THAT. EIGHT IF THAT IS THE CASE

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:21.999
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT IN JUST

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:23.434
BEING HONEST ABOUT IT.

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.970
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S THE CASE --

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:28.372
AND IT'S THURSDAY BE IT ISN'T IN

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:29.874
EVERY CASE IT ISN'T ON EVERY.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.777
PROGRAM THAT HAS SEEN SOME

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:35.413
REDUCTIONS BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:36.614
SWEET PROGRAM.

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.949
DID I MEAN THEY FOUND OTHER

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:40.418
FUNDING SOURCES SO THEY ARE

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:44.622
FULLY FUNDED A SOUGHT APART FROM.

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:45.823
D. G. R. F..

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.158
SO AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:49.260
BENEFITS I THINK IN SOME OF OUR

00:38:49.326 --> 00:38:50.795
PLANNING.

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:55.032
IS WE START THESE PROGRAMS WITH

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:56.567
THE IDEA THAT.

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.002
YOU KNOW WHEN IT ONCE IT GETS

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:59.537
ROLLING AND EVERYBODY ELSE SEES

00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:01.038
THE BENEFITS THAN.

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:02.506
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES BECOME

00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:03.741
AVAILABLE.

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.342
AND I AM PLEASE SIR.

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:06.343
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ENOUGH

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.745
RESPOND THE SECOND MORNING

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:08.546
JUMPED PATRICK DEPARTMENT OF

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:09.413
FINANCE.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.314
I'M NOT SURE WHICH

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:12.016
REPRESENTATIVES WE HAVE HERE

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.751
TODAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT -- BUT

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:14.852
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THE

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:16.220
CONVERSATION.

00:39:16.287 --> 00:39:19.256
THAT OVER THE YEARS A NUMBER OF

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:20.825
APPLICATIONS IN APPROPRIATIONS

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:22.259
HAVE BEEN MADE AS YOU WELL KNOW

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:23.794
FOR ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS.

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:26.063
GIVEN THE MULTI YEAR VALIDITY OF

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.099
THE DOLLARS AND THE OPERATIONAL

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.633
SORT OF CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.968
WITH WORKING WITH.

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.236
DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY FROM

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.205
DIFFERENT YEARS AS THEY GET CO

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.440
MINGLED IS IS IN SOME CASES.

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:37.842
AN OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE FOR

00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:39.310
DEPARTMENTS TO GET ALL OF THE

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.145
MONEY OUT THE DOOR PROJECTS ARE

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.847
STARTED PROJECTS SOMETIMES ARE

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:46.817
CANCELED UNEXPECTEDLY.

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:48.552
SO -- PART OF THIS DISCUSSION I

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:50.454
THINK IT WOULD BE -- USEFUL TO

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.089
KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT WHEN THERE

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:54.725
IS OVERLAP FOR EXAMPLE -- CDFA

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:56.260
RECEIVED A VERY LARGE POT OF

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:58.062
MONEY FOR DEAR DAIRY EFFORTS

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.531
LAST YEAR -- AND SO AS IT

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:03.200
RELATES TO HOW MUCH THEY CAN

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.970
MANAGE SORT OF A A CASH FLOW

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:07.972
BASIS IF YOU WILL IT I THINK IT

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:08.405
WARRANTS.

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:11.942
JUST TO BE FAIR ABOUT THAT THIS

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:12.910
THIS PROGRAM'S OVERSUBSCRIBED.

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:17.214
SO THERE ARE MORE APPLICATIONS.FOR THE MONEY THEN THERE IS

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:18.949
MONEY ALREADY IT'S AN

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:20.885
OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAM IN IN

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:21.786
THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY TWO YEARS

00:40:21.852 --> 00:40:22.520
OLD.

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:26.490
SO -- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK.

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.592
A COMPLICATED MULTI BILLION

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:29.827
DOLLAR INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE A

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:32.229
TURN ON A DIME IN EVEN GET THE

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:33.364
STRUCTURE IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.732
SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED TO BE AT A

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:37.234
REDUCED THEIR G. SHE'S. TWENTY

00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:37.968
FOUR MONTHS.

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:39.537
THIS IS WHEN THE BILL WAS PASSED

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:40.271
SO.

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:42.740
AND THE FACTS ARE THE PROGRAM IS

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:44.275
WAY OVER SUBSCRIBED IN REGARDS

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.643
TO THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:47.044
FOLKS ONE IMPLEMENT AND THE

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.079
DOLLARS -- THAT ARE AVAILABLE

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:52.082
AND THIS IS BASED OFF OF THE

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:54.151
NINETY NINE MILLION LAST YEAR.

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:55.986
SO -- I WOULD LOVE TO BE A HAVE

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:57.188
A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:59.323
THIS BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S OF

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.658
GREAT CONCERN.

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:01.926
MYSTERONS BROWN TO ME.

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.928
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD.

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:05.529
ALL RIGHT.

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:06.664
ABSOLUTELY AND THE

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.599
ADMINISTRATION LOOKS FORWARD TO

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:13.037
WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE.

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:14.939
I'M GONNA HOLD PUBLIC COMMENT

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:16.340
UNTIL AFTER WE GET.

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:19.009
TO THE NEXT ITEM LET'S MOVE ON

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:21.979
TO EACH OF CENTER CENTER STERN I

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:24.281
APOLOGIZE.

00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:29.153
I THANK MISTER -- WHAT IT IS SEE

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.621
WHAT LA -- INDIO F..

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:32.323
THOUGHT ABOUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:34.825
HANDLE.

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:36.527
THE WAY WE'RE FINDING SORT OF

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:38.662
OUR RESILIENCY WRIT LARGE.

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:43.200
AND SPECIFICALLY -- THE THE

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:47.104
RISKS WE'RE SEEING NOW -- AROUND

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:49.874
WILDFIRE LIABILITY TO THE STATE

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.175
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:52.610
IN OUR CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:55.646
ARE RELEGATED TO SORT OF TANSIT

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:57.014
AND THOSE ARE LONG TERM.

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:59.717
OPERATIONS OF HIGH SPEED RAIL.

00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:02.553
AND YOU KNOW ONE ITEM FOR

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.289
CONSIDERATION FOR THE FUTURE IS.

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:07.324
WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN.

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:08.692
I'D SAY GENEROUS AND AND

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:10.461
APPROPRIATELY SO WITH OUR

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:14.164
SPENDING AROUND -- FIRED -- BOTH

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:15.699
THEIR RISK MITIGATION AS WELL AS

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:17.101
SOME SUPPRESSION EFFORTS BUT

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:18.602
ESPECIALLY ON THE MITIGATE ON ON

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:20.137
THE RISK MITIGATION SIDE.

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.039
I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:23.908
WE SENT A SIGNAL.

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:25.576
OUT TO THE MARKETS THAT

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:27.144
CALIFORNIA WAS COMMITTED ON A

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:30.214
LONG TERM BASIS THE PUTTING.

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.749
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IF NOT

00:42:31.815 --> 00:42:34.652
BILLIONS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.754
INVESTED DIRECTLY AND RESILIENCY

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.521
IN REDUCING WILD.

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.390
RISK HOW THAT MIGHT MAKE OUR

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:41.725
STATES OF FISCAL ARRANGEMENT

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:43.294
ESPECIALLY ON THE UTILITY SIDE.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.129
WHAT IT ACTUALLY MIGHT DO TO BUY

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:47.631
DOWN SOME OF THAT RISK FROM?

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:50.334
NOT FROM A RATE BASE BUT FROM IN

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:51.368
SOME WAYS.

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:52.836
THE ORIGINAL COST CAUSATION

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:55.239
WHICH IS OUR CARBON POLLUTION

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:56.373
RIGHT I MEAN THE ORIGINAL THE

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.842
THE THE THOSE PAYING HERE.

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.377
IF YOU LOOK ATTHE OUR PRIMARY

00:43:00.444 --> 00:43:02.012
MISSIONS OF THE PETROLEUM SIDE

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.280
SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:04.181
BASICALLY BOUNCE THE ENTIRE

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.616
BURDEN OF CLIMATE.

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:07.851
ON THE UTILITY SECTOR SORT OF

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.053
WITHIN THAT SILO BUT I THINK

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.955
THERE'S A SORT OF HEALTHY

00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:13.157
ARGUMENT TO BE HAD -- FOR TRYING

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:15.192
TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY NOT

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:15.826
NECESSARILY DIRECTLY RELATED TO

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:18.662
THE RATE PAYER APPROPRIATE TYPE

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:19.930
FUNDING THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:21.598
IN THIS SPOT BUT IF YOU GO

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:23.100
BEYOND THE LINE.

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:24.568
ARE YOU GO BEYOND THAT SORT OF

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:25.703
BASIC HARDENING AND YOU SORT OF

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:26.937
START TO ZOOM OUT A LITTLE MORE

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:28.439
WHAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:29.673
THIS STATE SURVIVABLE.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.608
IN THE NEXT DECADE IT'S GONNA

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:33.811
TAKE A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:36.613
AREN'T NECESSARILY IN SAY THE

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.881
NINE OH ONE MITIGATION --

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:39.149
WILDFIRE PLANS.

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:40.250
SO I SAID I WANTED TO GET YOUR

00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:43.654
TAKE ON ON THAT THAT CONCEPT AND

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:47.224
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TODAY.

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:48.525
BUT IS THAT.

00:43:48.592 --> 00:43:49.026
IS THE IS THERE IS THERE

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:49.626
EFFICACY TO THIS STRATEGY IS

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.095
SORT OF THINKING ABOUT THIS IN A

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.730
LONGER TERM WAY RIGHT AS OPPOSED

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.264
TO AN ANNUAL OKAY THIS YEAR WE

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:56.033
WE CARE ABOUT FIRE OKAY NEXT

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:56.600
YEAR.

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:57.568
WE DON'T KNOW WE CARE ABOUT

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:59.103
CLIMATE RISK I MEAN I I DON'T

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:00.637
WANT TO JUST RELEGATED AGAIN TO

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:02.473
FIRE RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:05.242
VULNERABLE BOTH ON SEALEVEL RISE

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.644
WERE VULNERABLE ON ON FLOODS

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.446
THERE'S A LOT OF COSTS.

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:12.383
THEY WERE FACING -- BETWEEN NOW

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.917
AND SAY ARE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:16.286
SO JUST A A BRIEF THAT TAKE ON

00:44:16.353 --> 00:44:19.757
THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE EITHER LA

00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:22.459
OR DEAL WITH AND NOT.

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:23.894
IT WOULD HELP WAS WRITTEN THERE.

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:25.162
YOU CAN JUMP INTO THE AREA

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:26.730
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK

00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:28.365
THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TAKING IS

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:30.334
VERY WELL RECEIVED AND WE OF

00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:31.668
COURSE DO YOU HAVE TO THINK

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:33.037
ABOUT THESE.

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:35.406
EXPENDITURES IN A LONG TERM WAY

00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:38.042
SO NO NOT NECESSARILY ANY

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:40.844
IMMEDIATE REACTIONS TO YOUR

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:44.181
COMMENT BUT YEAH I MEAN I THINK

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:45.983
IT'S A A BIG AND IMPORTANT

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.851
QUESTION AND I DON'T HAVE ANY SO.

00:44:47.918 --> 00:44:49.153
I DON'T THINK GREAT ANSWERS AT

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.121
THIS POINT -- WELL I MEAN ONE

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:54.358
THOUGHT THAT COMES TO MIND IS --

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.659
YOU KNOW IT PART OF THE STRUGGLE

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:56.894
I THINK IT'S KIND OF THINKING

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.595
THROUGH AGAIN KINDA KNOW WHAT

00:44:58.662 --> 00:44:59.830
THE THE ROLE OF SORTS STATE

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:01.098
FUNDING IS FOR SOME OF THESE

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:02.533
ACTIVITIES AND ALSO SORT OF

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.001
TRYING TO AND MAINTAIN SORT OF

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:06.036
INCENTIVES FOR OTHER ACTORS

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.471
PRIVATE PARTIES ARE OTHER ACTORS.

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.073
MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW ALL

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:09.973
THE ALL THE ACTORS THAT HAVE

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.842
SORT OF A AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.444
REDUCE THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.079
RISK GOING FORWARD CAN CONTINUE

00:45:15.145 --> 00:45:16.113
TO HAVE THOSE INSURGENTS ARE

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.748
TRYING TO IN SOME CASES IT.

00:45:17.815 --> 00:45:18.615
CERTAINLY WILL BE SORT OF THAT

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:20.250
YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY STATE ROLE

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:21.819
FOR THAT IN OTHER CASES YOU

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:22.920
MAYBE NOT THOSE ARE SORT OF

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:23.687
TRYING TO THINK THROUGH KIND OF

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:25.255
HOW THE STATE RESOURCES CAN BE

00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:26.757
TARGETED. TO TO TO REDUCE THAT

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:28.025
RISK BUT ALSO SORT OF MAINTAIN

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:30.260
THOSE SIGNALS AND SO -- THOSE

00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:31.061
ARE THOSE ARE LIKE I THINK TO

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:32.396
SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS BUT

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:36.800
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE WILL

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:41.038
CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT.

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:43.674
CLOSE ISSUE NUMBER ONE ONE OF

00:54:53.556 --> 00:54:54.991
COUPLE THINGS THAT ARE IN YOUR

00:54:55.058 --> 00:54:57.360
AGENDA AS WELL -- THE THE

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:58.928
PROPOSAL HERE.

00:54:58.995 --> 00:55:00.530
REALLY HAS KIND OF A FOCUS AS AS

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:02.198
WAS MENTIONED ON KIND OF CAREERS

00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:05.602
AND UNLIKE A LOT OF THE OTHER --

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:07.537
FUNDING PROGRAMS FROM THE G. R.

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:08.638
OUT THAT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:10.273
FOCUSED ON KIND OF PROJECTS THAT

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.541
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:12.709
SO I MEAN WE THINK THAT JUST

THIS.

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:18.882
MONEY TO THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.316
OF ACTIVITIES.

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:22.018
WE DO THINK THAT.

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:23.053
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANNA

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.054
THINK ABOUT ASKING JUST SOME

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.255
MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:27.357
SOME OF THE PARTICULAR PROPOSALS

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:29.292
I THINK ON THE APPRENTICESHIP

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:31.728
PROGRAMS A CERTIFICATE EXPANSION

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:33.663
OF EXISTING PROGRAMS -- IN

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.398
PARTICULAR -- YOU KNOW HOW THE

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:36.666
DEPARTMENT PLANS ON KIND OF

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:37.901
SCALE IN THOSE OUT THAT SO IN

00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:39.703
SOME CASES A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:42.272
EXPANSION OF OF KIND OF AN

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:44.541
EXISTING -- PROGRAM AND SO HOW

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:46.009
THEY WILL SCALE IT UP AND I'LL

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:47.110
STOP HERE IF I THINK IT AND I

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:48.411
THINK IT'S A PRE APPRENTICESHIP

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:49.913
PROGRAM SKEWS ME I'M SORRY

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:50.980
BECAUSE THERE WERE IF IT WERE AN

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.549
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ONE WOULD

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:53.850
THINK THAT THAT.

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:55.418
INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE OUT THERE

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:57.654
DOING SOME POTENTIALLY DOING

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:59.355
SOME GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:01.357
THIS IS A PRE APPRENTICESHIP

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:02.759
PROGRAM THAT IS.

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:05.628
BEFORE US IS A GUN THE

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.397
GREENHOUSE GAS FUN.

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:08.064
MY APOLOGIES MISS NO NO I JUST I

00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:11.101
pTHAT SAID ANOTHER STEP REMOVED

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:12.869
ALTHOUGH WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.604
THEM AND AND TWO FORMER TRIED

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:15.905
AND TRUE.

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:18.108
BUT BUT THIS IS ANOTHER STEP

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:18.842
REMOVED.

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.910
YES YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS A

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:21.644
A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:25.181
WHICH IS -- BEFORE OBVIOUSLY SO --

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:27.584
I THINK ON THE WORKER TRANSITION

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:30.286
PILOT PROGRAM -- WHICH WAS THE

00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:32.288
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY --

00:56:32.355 --> 00:56:33.990
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS -- THIS

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.859
IS UNLIKE THE OTHER ONES IS A

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.727
NEW PROGRAM -- FOR THE FIRST

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:38.828
COUPLE YEARS OUR OUR

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:40.964
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT -- THE

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.931
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD FIND

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:43.233
KIND OF A MESS A STUDY AND

00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:44.267
ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL

00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:45.502
COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD

00:56:45.568 --> 00:56:47.570
PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM.

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:49.205
AND SO ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS.

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.473
WE THINK IS IS WHETHER OR NOT

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.775
SORT OF THE THE LEGISLATURE

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:53.042
NEEDS TO COMMIT TO FIVE YEARS

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:54.644
FONT OF FUNDING FOR THIS OR

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:55.678
WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT WANT TO

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:56.880
CONSIDER ALLOCATING.

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:58.047
MONEY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF

00:56:58.114 --> 00:56:59.449
YEARS AND MAYBE EVEN A

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.316
POTENTIALLY A LOWER AMOUNT

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:01.584
DEPENDING ON THE COST OF JUST

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:03.153
THAT STUDY MEN COME BACK ONCE

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.454
THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY AN

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:06.489
ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATE -- WHAT

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:08.191
THE ON GOING NEEDS FOR SUCH A

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:10.994
PILOT MIGHT BE -- AND SELL OUT A

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.729
WITH MY COMMENTS AT THAT. NINE I

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:13.997
KNOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:14.931
THAT.

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:22.772
MAY BE THREE NINE EIGHT WHICH

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:23.840
INCLUDED LANGUAGE ABOUT.

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:24.440
REIGNING DOESN'T BECOME LIVE

THEY'RE STINGY ABOUT SPENDING

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.583
MONEY THAT HAS A DIRECT NEXUS

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:34.984
BETWEEN GREENHOUSE GASES AT

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:36.786
LEAST WHAT WE'RE STILL IN AN A.

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:40.256
B. -- THIRTY TWO ARENA I MEAN I

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:42.759

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.160
THIS PROPOSAL WAS COMING BEFORE

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:46.062
US NEXT YEAR WELL WE KNEW TWO

THEN YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THE MATH

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:00.210
ON THAT.

00:58:00.276 --> 00:58:00.777
I MEAN I THINK THAT THERE'S

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:01.344
QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:02.912
AROUND KIND OF AROUND THAT

PARTICULAR ISSUE I MEAN IT'S

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:07.650
DEFINITELY -- WORTH CONSIDERING

OF JOBS IN THE CHANGING ECONOMY --

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.481
AND IT BEGINS TO ADDRESS THE

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:47.083
NEED FOR THE INCREASED JOB

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.217

DEVELOPMENT -- TO BUILD THE

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:53.256
CAPACITY TO TRANSITION INTO.

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:54.390
THE REDUCED EMISSIONS COMIC

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:56.726
THAT'S TRUE BUT THREE NINE EIGHT

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:57.560
DOESN'T ONLY.

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:59.996
THE AB THIRTY TWO ENDS IN

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.498
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AB

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:03.066
THREE NINE EIGHT STARTS IN

THIS COMMITTEE TO USE FUNDS FROM

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.709
AUCTIONS AND SOME OF THEM MAY

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.210
HAVE BEEN LAST YEAR'S AUCTIONS

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.878
OR TWENTY SIXTEEN MONEY WHICH

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:18.147
CLEARLY HAS TO SHOW A NEXUS.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:20.550
AND YOU'RE POINTING TO TWENTY

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:21.150
TWENTY ONE AND SAYING BUT IT

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:23.486
WILL BE LEGAL DURING THAT TIME.

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.154
THAT'S THE QUESTION NOT THAT IT

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.790
IS I GET DID IT FALL I FART READ

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:28.791
THREE NINE EIGHT AND I GET THAT

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.193
IF I WAS SITTING HERE A YEAR

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:32.028
FROM NOW THIS WOULD BE AN EASIER

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:33.096
QUESTION.

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:37.533
BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF COMPETING.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.002
PROJECTS HERE IN AT LEAST I WANT

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:40.536
TO MEET THE MINIMUM LEVEL LEGAL

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:43.239
THRESHOLD THAT THERE'S A NEXUS.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.008
SO I UNDERSTAND IT HIS THREE

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.609
NINE FIVE I'M ASKING YOU VISITED

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:49.145
A B..

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:49.779
THIRTY TWO I THINK THE ANSWER IS

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:50.713
NO.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.748
I MEAN IF IF IT WAS AN

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:52.448
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM A

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:54.050
PROBABLY WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.718
CLOSER.

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:56.319
BUT IT'S A PRE APPRENTICESHIP

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:57.987
PROGRAM.

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:01.924
THAT'S THE DILEMMA WE HAVE.

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.326
OKAY JUST MAKE A QUICK COMMENT.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:05.094
THE THE PRECONSTRUCTION TRAINING

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.729
PROGRAMS ARE DYINGIN ALIGNMENT

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.131
CLOSE ALIGNMENT WITH THE LOCAL

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:08.765
BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS AND THE

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.333
JOINT APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.036
COMMITTEES THEMSELVES SO WHILE

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:13.636
WE'RE DOING PRE APPRENTICESHIP

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:14.470
WORK.

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:16.005
THE CHANCES OF OF THESE

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.507
INDIVIDUALS HE'S PARTICIPANTS TO

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.409
LAND IN A PARTNERSHIP SLOTS IS

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:20.343
VERY VERY HIGH IN FACT WE'VE HAD

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.378
GREAT -- THE EXPERIENCE WITH

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:24.247
THAT SO AS WE GET MORE WORK --

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.148
THAT IS PULLING CARBON IN THE

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:26.816
ATMOSPHERE THERE'S A DEMAND FOR

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.051
NEW APPRENTICES AND WE'RE

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.152
FILLING THAT DEMAND IN CAHOOTS

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:30.753
WITH MIDNIGHT I PRESUME THAT

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.388
THAT'S TRUE THE QUESTION IS IS

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:33.956
THAT WE HAVE A LIMITED USE OF

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.425
THE FUNDS THERE BE BETTER.

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.060
THAT RAN THE BANK RIGHT NOW IN A

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.928
COUPLE OF YEARS WE GOT MORE

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.463
FLEXIBILITY BUT THE LIMITED

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.331
FUNDS THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT MAY

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.666
BE TRUE AND THEY MAY GO OUT AND

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.002
WORK ON ANAEROBIC DIGESTERS ARE

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:47.303
HEALTHY SOILS OR WHAT.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.404
IT'S ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS IS

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.672
GIVE US GREENHOUSE GAS

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:52.475
REDUCTIONS IN SOME CO BENEFITS

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.345
RIGHT BUT TODAY.

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.948
THEY DON'T.

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:01.918
CENTER MONEY YOUR QUESTION

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:02.218
[inaudible]

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:03.386
QUESTIONS.

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:06.222
YES I WILL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:08.157
JUST PICKING UP ON WHAT YOU

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:09.258
SUGGESTED.

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.094
THE DILEMMA IS YOU'RE NOT ABLE

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.328
TO GET INTO THE APPRENTICESHIP

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.229
PROGRAM IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.797
PRE APPRENTICE TRAINING SO IT'S

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:16.966
KIND OF A CATCH TWENTY TWO WE

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.734
WANT TO HAVE THE POSITIVE

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:21.237
IMPACTS IN TERMS OF THE WORK

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:22.872
THAT'S DESIGNED.

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:24.474
TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.175
EMISSIONS BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.411
MEET THAT GOAL IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.645
PEOPLE WHO ARE.

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:30.646
PREPARED TO MOVE INTO THE

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:32.115
APPRENTICE PROGRAM.

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:35.017
SO. ONE COULD ARGUE THERE IS A

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.453
NEXUS BUT IT'S NOT AN IMMEDIATE.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.622
COST BENEFIT OF THE DOLLAR BEING

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:41.157
SPENT IS WHAT I HEAR YOU

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.959
SUGGESTING OR IT COULD BE A

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.460
DIFFERENT PROPOSAL.

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.928
THAT THAT THE FUNDS FOR THIS

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.063
YEAR'S FUNDING ON THE PRE

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:47.930
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WOULD

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:49.866
COME FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE WITH

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.200
THE IDEA THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:52.635
THAT HOPE WE SAT.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.337
NEXT YEAR IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.304
THEY WERE COME FROM GREENHOUSE

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:57.473
GASES WHEN WE WERE UNDER THE

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.510
UMBRELLA OF THREE NINE EIGHT

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.478
JUICE I CAN'T.

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:03.112
MAMA COMMA SENATOR IF YOU DON'T

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:03.312
MIND.

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.347
IT AND I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.716
THAT THE NEXUS QUESTION.

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:08.518
BUT JUST TO CLARIFY THE WORK

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:10.419
THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN.

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:11.687
ANOTHER PROJECT TO CURRENT I

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.156
RETURNING PARTNERSHIP THAT WE

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.924
HAVE IS IN TRANSIT IN SEVERAL

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:16.259
TRANSIT AGENCIES AROUND --

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:18.828
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY

BUILDING TO OTHER TRANSIT

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:19.962
AGENCIES.

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:21.030
IT WAS JUST TALKING TO THE HEAD

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.398
OF AC TRANSIT THE OTHER DAY MY

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.466
KERSH.

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:26.502
THEY ARE BRINGING IN AS REQUIRED

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:28.237
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BUSES.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:30.706
AND THE MAINTENANCE WORKERS --

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:32.141
ON THOSE BUSES IN THE MECHANICS

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.509
AND THE OPERATORS ALL HAVE TO BE

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:34.877
RETRAINED FOR ZERO EMISSION

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:35.711
BUSES.

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.046
IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS WORK FORCE

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:39.081
TO DO THAT AND WE CO INVEST WITH

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:40.616
THESE TRANSIT AGENCIES TO TOUGH

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.018
TO TRAIN THESE WORKERS.

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:42.852
THEY WERE GONNA HAVE FLEETS

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.720
THERE SITTING IDLE -- SO THERE'S

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:45.988
IT'S NOT JUST THE PRE

POPULAR PROGRAM WITH THE DAIRY

PRODUCERS THAT WE WORK WITH --

01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:39.866
MOST ARIES ONLY ABOUT 20% OF THE

STATE'S JERRY'S CAN ACTUALLY DO

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.201
A DYING JESTER BECAUSE THEY

JUSTIFY IT NOR DO THEY HAVE THE

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:48.308
CAPITAL TO DO IT I JUST -- SO

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:50.043
THEY MUST DO SOMETHING ELSE IN

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.444

BUT THE WAY THE AMP FUNDING HAS

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.583

IT RIGHT WHATEVER IT IS I WOULD

02:28:31.802 --> 02:28:32.903
LOOK AT THE SCIENCE THAT THEY

02:28:32.970 --> 02:28:34.005
COULD COME UP WITH.

02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:35.506
HOW DO YOU ENVISION THOSE WITH

I GET A PAT ON THE MEDICATION

02:28:40.645 --> 02:28:43.014
WHICH IS A TECHNICAL

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:43.314
[inaudible]

02:28:43.381 --> 02:28:46.584
FORESTRY SCIENCE.

02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:49.587
WHAT IS A REPAIR ADVOCATE?

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:50.921

OKAY WELL I THINK THE PEOPLE GET

02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:58.029
IT NOT LIKE IT IT'S DOES IT WORK

NOW.

02:29:02.199 --> 02:29:06.637
WHO THESE PEOPLE BE?

02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:08.539

PROCEEDINGS IN MATTERS OF SAFETY

02:29:15.379 --> 02:29:16.681
CHAIRMAN IS WE LOOK AT THE

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:18.416
ADEQUACY OF THE UTILITY FILING

02:29:18.482 --> 02:29:19.116
ARE THEY TAKING THE

02:29:19.183 --> 02:29:21.519
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THESE EXPERTS.

02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:23.487
IN FORESTRY AND WILD FIRE WE

02:29:23.554 --> 02:29:24.522
HAVE OUR OWN SAFETY PEOPLE WHO

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:26.757
ARE EXPERTS IN A VARIETY OF

02:29:26.824 --> 02:29:28.259
SAFETY TOPICS ONE OF THE AREAS

02:29:28.326 --> 02:29:29.660
THAT THESE ARE INTENDED TO

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:30.761
INCREASE.

02:29:30.828 --> 02:29:32.830
IS EXACTLY IN THE AREAS OF FIRE

02:29:32.897 --> 02:29:34.598
SAFETY COVERED CONDUCTOR WEATHER

02:29:34.665 --> 02:29:37.568
MONITORING FORECASTING -- A

02:29:37.635 --> 02:29:39.003
VARIETY OF TOPICS AND ISSUES

02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:40.237
THAT REALLY EXACTLY TO

02:29:40.304 --> 02:29:41.672
PREVENTING CATASTROPHIC

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:43.074
WILDFIRES.

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:44.175
WE RECENTLY REVIEWED THE

02:29:44.241 --> 02:29:47.044
UTILITIES FILINGS IN THEIR

02:29:47.111 --> 02:29:47.578
TWENTY NINETEEN WILD FIRE

02:29:47.645 --> 02:29:48.612
MITIGATION PLANS.

02:29:48.679 --> 02:29:50.381
AND ONE OF THE CONSISTENT THEMES

02:29:50.448 --> 02:29:52.116
THAT WE IDENTIFIED AND WE'RE

02:29:52.183 --> 02:29:53.317
STILL REVIEWING WITH THE OTHER

02:29:53.384 --> 02:29:55.186
PARTY SAID THAT TO DATE.

02:29:55.252 --> 02:29:56.554
WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT IS

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.222
HOLISTICALLY INCONSISTENTLY

02:29:58.289 --> 02:29:59.724
EXAMINED THE ADEQUACY OF THESE

02:29:59.790 --> 02:30:03.027
PROGRAMS.

02:30:03.094 --> 02:30:04.628
AT THE PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL -- SO

02:30:04.695 --> 02:30:05.930
FOR EXAMPLE DO THE UTILITIES

02:30:05.996 --> 02:30:07.698
ACTUALLY KNOW HOW MUCH RISK WILL

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:09.867
BE REDUCED ARE THEY ACTUALLY

02:30:09.934 --> 02:30:11.135
PUTTING THESE PROGRAMS AND

02:30:11.202 --> 02:30:12.136
PROJECTS.

02:30:12.203 --> 02:30:14.105
IN THE HIGH THREAT FIRE AREAS

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:16.140
IDENTIFIED BY CAL FIRE ARE THEY

02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:17.775
GOING OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS IF

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:19.310
THEY ARE GOING OUTSIDE OF THOSE

02:30:19.377 --> 02:30:20.711
AREAS WHY.

02:30:20.778 --> 02:30:22.646
SO IT'S NOT AT THIS POINT IT'S

02:30:22.713 --> 02:30:23.848
NOT LOOKING AT THE MONEY THERE'S

02:30:23.914 --> 02:30:25.516
ALWAYS OF COURSE ARE YOU DOING

02:30:25.583 --> 02:30:27.385
IT EFFICIENTLY BUT THIS IS ARE

02:30:27.451 --> 02:30:29.120
YOU DOING IT IN THE RIGHT AREAS.

02:30:29.186 --> 02:30:32.556
THAT WILL ADEQUATELY REDUCE RISK.

02:30:32.623 --> 02:30:34.191
LEO DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT THIS

02:30:34.258 --> 02:30:35.393
ON THE NOVELTY OF THE STAFF

02:30:35.459 --> 02:30:37.762
REPORT TALKS ABOUT THE NOVELTY

02:30:37.828 --> 02:30:38.496
OF THIS.

02:30:38.562 --> 02:30:40.698
NEW.

02:30:40.765 --> 02:30:41.332
ARENA WE'RE GETTING ON WITH THE

02:30:41.399 --> 02:30:42.133
PLO.

02:30:42.199 --> 02:30:43.934
I'M A WE DON'T HAVE ANY

02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:45.136
PARTICULAR COMMENTS I MEAN I I

SORT OF THE NEW ACTIVITIES THERE

02:30:47.438 --> 02:30:49.106
WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE SOME KIND

02:30:49.173 --> 02:30:50.941
OF YOU KNOW NEW EXPERTISE THAT

02:30:51.008 --> 02:30:52.009

OKAY PLEASE PROCEED OKAY.

02:30:57.982 --> 02:30:59.917
I'M GONNA GET TO THE SECOND AREA

02:30:59.984 --> 02:31:03.988
OF OUR OUR SAFETY BCP -- AND

02:31:04.054 --> 02:31:05.289
THAT IS THE FOCUS ON WELFARE

02:31:05.356 --> 02:31:07.758
COSTS AND SECURITIZATION.

02:31:07.825 --> 02:31:09.560
OF WHERE WE ARE ASKING FOR FIVE

02:31:09.627 --> 02:31:13.264
POSITIONS AS WELL -- WE ARE

02:31:13.330 --> 02:31:14.832
REQUESTING THESE POSITIONS TO

02:31:14.899 --> 02:31:16.400
CONDUCT FINANCIAL ECONOMIC AND

02:31:16.467 --> 02:31:17.568
POLICY ANALYSIS OF THE

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:19.670
REASONABLENESS OF THE UTILITY

02:31:19.737 --> 02:31:21.839
COSTS REQUEST.

02:31:21.906 --> 02:31:23.541
IN REVIEWING P. GENIES WILD FIRE

02:31:23.607 --> 02:31:25.409
MITIGATION PLAN WE'VE IDENTIFIED

02:31:25.476 --> 02:31:27.244
EXTENSIVE OVERLAP WITH THE

02:31:27.311 --> 02:31:28.712
PROPOSALS PRESENTED IMPEACHING

02:31:28.779 --> 02:31:30.714
NEEDS TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL RATE

02:31:30.781 --> 02:31:32.016
CASE APPLICATION.

02:31:32.082 --> 02:31:33.751
NOT ONLY FROM A PROGRAMMATIC

02:31:33.818 --> 02:31:37.354
LEVEL AND A PROJECT BASIS BUT

02:31:37.421 --> 02:31:39.290
ALSO FROM A COST BASIS.

02:31:39.356 --> 02:31:40.090
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

02:31:40.157 --> 02:31:41.459
SCRUTINIZE THE UTILITIES

02:31:41.525 --> 02:31:43.427
PROPOSALS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR

02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:44.728
COSTS ARE REASONABLE.

02:31:44.795 --> 02:31:45.796
AND THAT THEY ARE NOT SEEKING

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:47.164
COST RECOVERY FOR THE SAME

02:31:47.231 --> 02:31:49.700
PROGRAMS IN DIFFERENT

02:31:49.767 --> 02:31:50.768
PROCEEDINGS.

02:31:50.835 --> 02:31:51.802
THE NEW POSITIONS ALSO WILL

02:31:51.869 --> 02:31:53.304
PERFORM TH ANALYSIS ASSOCIATED

02:31:53.370 --> 02:31:56.774
WITH REPAIR PROTECTION FINANCING.

02:31:56.841 --> 02:31:58.175
FINALLY WE HAVE REQUESTED FOR

02:31:58.242 --> 02:32:00.211
ATTORNEY POSITIONS TO PROVIDE

02:32:00.277 --> 02:32:01.679
LEGAL SUPPORT IN PREPARING

02:32:01.745 --> 02:32:02.813
DISCOVERY.

02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:04.815
OF LEGAL BRIEFS AND DEALING WITH

02:32:04.882 --> 02:32:06.116
THE NECESSARY LEGAL MATTERS TO

02:32:06.183 --> 02:32:08.786
SUPPORT OUR OUR POLICY TECHNICAL

02:32:08.853 --> 02:32:10.287
EFFORT.

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:12.523
SO LET'S SAY ONE OF THE FOUR

02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:14.992
TOURNEY'S DETERMINES THAT THEY

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:17.895
BELIEVE THAT THE THERE -- OVER

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:18.863
SECURED.

02:32:18.929 --> 02:32:20.564
THERE'S THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING

02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:22.366
FOR SOME FUNDS TO TO TO DO SOME

02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:25.302
WORK AND IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:32:25.369 --> 02:32:26.971
OF WORK TO DO AND THEY'VE GOT AN

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:28.372
ASSET WORTH A THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:30.407
AND THEY WANT TO SECURE THE

02:32:30.474 --> 02:32:31.141
PAYMENT OF THAT [inaudible]

02:32:31.208 --> 02:32:33.177
SO WHAT [inaudible]

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:34.745
WHAT?

02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:37.014
IT'S A SECURE IT'S ONLY SECURED

02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:38.983
TO THE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

02:32:39.049 --> 02:32:40.417
WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE

02:32:40.484 --> 02:32:42.286
BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE?

02:32:42.353 --> 02:32:44.421
IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. TO

02:32:44.488 --> 02:32:45.923
THE NEXT PERSON WANTS TO SECURE

02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.824
BECAUSE THEY BE IN SECOND

02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:48.292
POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE NOT

02:32:48.359 --> 02:32:50.060
HAVE PRIORITY RIGHT BUT AS FAR

02:32:50.127 --> 02:32:54.732
AS THE AS AS HOW TO GUARANTEEING

02:32:54.798 --> 02:32:55.833
THE REPAYMENT.

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:57.902
OF OF THAT THE MONEY THAT THEY

02:32:57.968 --> 02:33:00.137
HAVE.

02:33:00.204 --> 02:33:01.705
WHY IT WHY WOULD THE WAY WITH

02:33:01.772 --> 02:33:03.073
THE P. YOU SEE NOT BE ABLE TO

02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:04.975
FIGURE THAT OUT AND AND A NICE

02:33:05.042 --> 02:33:07.378
KNOWLEDGE OF HOW WHAT WOULD WHAT

02:33:07.444 --> 02:33:08.746
DO YOU ENVISION THE PA OF?

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:12.216
DOING JUST A KIND OF FIND THAT

02:33:12.283 --> 02:33:15.452
THIS IS OVER SECURED.

02:33:15.519 --> 02:33:16.954
PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE

02:33:17.021 --> 02:33:18.989
LOOKING AT IS.

02:33:19.056 --> 02:33:20.824
UNDERNEATH SP NINE OH ONE IF

02:33:20.891 --> 02:33:22.626
SECURITIZATION OCCURS AND THAT

02:33:22.693 --> 02:33:24.762
VALUE IS NOT THE RIGHT VALUE IN

02:33:24.828 --> 02:33:26.397
THE CASE THAT YOU PRESENTED.

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:28.032
IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS WE KNOW

02:33:28.098 --> 02:33:29.767
IT'S A THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S NOT

02:33:29.833 --> 02:33:31.435
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC.

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:33.571
IF IT WAS BEFORE AT A THOUSAND

02:33:33.637 --> 02:33:35.439
DOLLARS AND THEY WANT TO COME IN

02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:36.307
FOR ANOTHER.

02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:37.141
FIVE HUNDRED WELL THAT BECOMES

02:33:37.207 --> 02:33:39.343
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IF THE EXTRA

02:33:39.410 --> 02:33:40.544
FIVE HUNDRED IS MONEY THAT.

02:33:40.611 --> 02:33:41.545
IN THE CASE OF UTILITY

02:41:13.997 --> 02:41:15.465
TODAY IS THE WORD DEPARTMENT OF

02:41:15.532 --> 02:41:17.167
FINANCE BUT THAT'S A QUESTION

02:41:17.234 --> 02:41:18.602
THAT'S COME UP SINCE YOU KNOW WE

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:20.270
FIRST EVALUATED THE BUDGET

02:41:20.337 --> 02:41:22.439
PROPOSAL IS WHERE IS THE FUNDING

02:41:22.506 --> 02:41:25.275
GOING TO COME FROM TO TO HANDLE

02:41:25.342 --> 02:41:26.710
THAT THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS

02:41:26.777 --> 02:41:28.912
IDENTIFIED IN -- WHAT'S BEEN

02:41:28.979 --> 02:41:29.513
REFERRED TO AS THE FORTY FIVE

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:30.380
DAY REPORT.

02:41:30.447 --> 02:41:33.016
AND AND WILL IT COME FROM.

02:41:33.083 --> 02:41:35.152
THE FINDING HERE IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:41:35.218 --> 02:41:36.953
SOME OF THEM IS POSSIBLY COMING

02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:38.188
FROM FINDING THOSE PROVIDED IN

02:41:38.255 --> 02:41:40.057
THE CURRENT YEAR -- WHEN YOU'RE

02:41:40.123 --> 02:41:41.992
LOOKING AT HOW THAT RELATES BACK

02:41:42.059 --> 02:41:43.627
TO THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE

02:41:43.693 --> 02:41:45.162
MILLION DOLLAR PACKET?

02:41:45.228 --> 02:41:47.130
I'M PROBABLY THE FIRE PREVENTION

02:41:47.197 --> 02:41:49.032
GRANTS OR THE PROJECTS BEING

02:41:49.099 --> 02:41:51.068
DIRECTLY UNDERTAKEN BY CAL FIRE

02:41:51.134 --> 02:41:52.335
WOULD BE MORE.

02:41:52.402 --> 02:41:54.137
IN LINE SINCE -- I ATE MY

02:41:54.204 --> 02:41:55.272
UNDERSTANDING MOST THE PROJECTS

02:41:55.338 --> 02:41:57.340
ARE FOCUSED ON ON PROTECTING

02:41:57.407 --> 02:41:58.909
COMMUNITIES IN CONSTRUCTING FEEL

02:41:58.975 --> 02:42:00.343
BREAKS AND THAT SORT OF THING.

02:42:00.410 --> 02:42:01.378
BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY GOOD

02:42:01.445 --> 02:42:03.113
QUESTION AS THIS IS SORT OF AN

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:05.382
EVOLVING SITUATION IS HOW HOW

02:42:05.449 --> 02:42:06.683
DOES THE CHANGES IN THE CURRENT

02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:08.518
YEAR IMPACT THE FINDING THAT

02:42:08.585 --> 02:42:10.287
YOU'RE LOOKING AT FOR NINETEEN

02:42:10.353 --> 02:42:11.388
TWENTY AS WELL IS IS IT

02:42:11.455 --> 02:42:11.955
REDIRECTING FUNDING IN THE

02:42:12.022 --> 02:42:13.090
CURRENT YEAR.

02:42:13.156 --> 02:42:14.591
AND IF SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

02:42:14.658 --> 02:42:16.593
FOR A FOR THE FOR FINDING IN THE

02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:17.461
NINETEEN TWENTY IN NINETEEN

02:42:17.527 --> 02:42:18.595
TWENTY BUDGET YEAR AND SO I

02:42:18.662 --> 02:42:19.963
THINK THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS

02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:22.265
AND YOU KNOW OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS

02:42:22.332 --> 02:42:23.567
TO INSURE THAT YOU FULLY

02:42:23.633 --> 02:42:25.168
UNDERSTAND WHAT ONE WHAT'S

02:42:25.235 --> 02:42:26.269
HAPPENING IN THE CURRENT YEAR

02:42:26.336 --> 02:42:27.170
INTO WHAT.

02:42:27.237 --> 02:42:34.344
YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE --

02:42:34.411 --> 02:42:34.911
FOR NINETEEN TWENTY CONTINUE

02:42:34.978 --> 02:42:36.079
WHAT YOU'RE.

02:42:36.146 --> 02:42:36.646
YOUR THOUGHTS THANK YOU MR

02:42:36.713 --> 02:42:37.314
RECORD THEM IS SO THAT THE

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.448
SECOND PIECE OF THAT TWO HUNDRED

02:42:38.515 --> 02:42:39.749
MILLION DOLLARS IS REQUIRED BY

02:42:39.816 --> 02:42:41.751
S. B. NINE I WENT IS FOR

02:42:41.818 --> 02:42:43.186
PRESCRIBED BURN CRUISE.

02:42:43.253 --> 02:42:44.688
SPECIFICALLY THIRTY FIVE MILLION

02:42:44.754 --> 02:42:46.756
DOLLARS SO CURRENTLY CAL FIRE

02:42:46.823 --> 02:42:48.625
HAS SIX I BELIEVE PRESCRIBED

02:42:48.692 --> 02:42:50.393
BURN CRUISE THIS WOULD TAKE THEM

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:53.396
UP TO TEN THAT STARTING IN.

02:42:53.463 --> 02:42:53.930
NINETEEN TWENTY AND THESE

02:42:53.997 --> 02:42:55.398
DEDICATED PRESCRIBER CREWS ARE

02:42:55.465 --> 02:42:57.033
RELATIVELY NEW -- CAL FIRE IS

02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:59.736
STILL IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING

02:42:59.803 --> 02:43:01.872
UP IN TRAINING THESE CREWS AND

02:43:01.938 --> 02:43:03.173
SO GETTING A SENSE OF HOW THAT

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:04.674
PROCESS HAS GONE AND ARE THERE

02:43:04.741 --> 02:43:07.010
LESSONS LEARNED AD AND HOW WHAT

02:43:07.077 --> 02:43:08.245
CAN YOU EXPECT IN TERMS OF HOW

02:43:08.311 --> 02:43:09.312
QUICKLY THESE CREWS ARE ACTUALLY

02:43:09.379 --> 02:43:09.546
TO BE.

02:43:09.613 --> 02:43:11.548
ON THE GROUND I'M GETTING WORK

02:43:11.615 --> 02:43:12.883
DONE AND WHERE THEY'LL BE

02:43:12.949 --> 02:43:15.051
LOCATED IN AND AND HOW THEY'LL

02:43:15.118 --> 02:43:16.386
BE PRIORITIZED AND HOW THEY'LL

02:43:16.453 --> 02:43:17.587
BE.

02:43:17.654 --> 02:43:19.289
AND YOU KNOW HOW THE DEPARTMENT

02:43:19.356 --> 02:43:20.590
CAN ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T GET

02:43:20.657 --> 02:43:21.491
JUST PULLED INTO FIRE

02:43:21.558 --> 02:43:23.093
SUPPRESSION WORK AND AND YOU

02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:24.995
KNOW THAT THEY CAN PROTECT THE

02:43:25.061 --> 02:43:26.796
MISSION OF THOSE CREWS -- AND SO

02:43:26.863 --> 02:43:27.831
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT

02:43:27.898 --> 02:43:29.666
OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS I HAVE

02:43:29.733 --> 02:43:31.168
ANOTHER ONE FOR THE CURRENT THE

02:43:31.234 --> 02:43:32.035
CURRENT.

02:43:32.102 --> 02:43:33.737
BUDGET THAT YOU'RE LOOKING ON

02:43:33.803 --> 02:43:34.638
THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR.

02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:36.039
I'M ASKING I KNOW ONE REQUIRES

02:43:36.106 --> 02:43:38.141
CAL FIRE TO ESTABLISH A WILDFIRE

02:43:38.208 --> 02:43:40.410
RESILIENCE PROGRAM SO THERE IS A

02:43:40.477 --> 02:43:43.446
FINDING THAT IS INCLUDED AND IN

02:43:43.513 --> 02:43:46.983
THE BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAM AND

02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:54.858
AND AND BLINKING ON THE AMOUNT

02:43:54.925 --> 02:43:57.527
RIGHT NOW BUT THERE.

02:43:57.594 --> 02:44:02.332
AND BY PROGRAM BUT IT'S UNCLEAR

02:44:02.399 --> 02:44:02.966
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

02:44:03.033 --> 02:44:06.336
SERVED.

02:44:06.403 --> 02:44:08.004
PACIFIC STAFFING LEVELS THAT

02:44:08.071 --> 02:44:08.838
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED AS WE THINK

02:44:08.905 --> 02:44:10.040
THERE'S SOME SOME OVERSIGHT

02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:11.474
QUESTIONS THERE JUST TO MAKE

02:44:11.541 --> 02:44:13.210
SURE THAT WHAT WHAT'S BEEN

02:44:13.276 --> 02:44:14.911
APPROVED AND THE LEVEL AND THAT

02:44:14.978 --> 02:44:16.446
THAT PROGRAM IS BEING INITIATED

02:44:16.513 --> 02:44:18.615
THAT REALLY MATCHES WITH WHAT

02:44:18.682 --> 02:44:19.983
THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT WAS.

02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:21.218
IN REQUIRING THEM TO CREATE THIS

02:44:21.284 --> 02:44:23.053
PROGRAM AND THIS IS SEPARATE AND

02:44:23.119 --> 02:44:24.354
DISTINCT FROM THE PRESCRIBED

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:27.324
BURN OR THE HEALTHY -- FORCE

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:30.093
THIS IS THE RESILIENCE PIECE OF

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:31.461
CORRECT IN THIS PROGRAM IS

02:44:31.528 --> 02:44:33.330
ESSENTIALLY I AM AT THE SET UP

02:44:33.396 --> 02:44:34.731
AND I CAN LET THE MINISTRATION

02:44:34.798 --> 02:44:37.234
SPEAK TO IT BETTER -- BUT TO TO

02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:40.203
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO

02:44:40.270 --> 02:44:42.172
SMALLER LANDOWNERS -- AND HELP

02:44:42.239 --> 02:44:43.240
THEM SORT OF THROUGH THE

02:44:43.306 --> 02:44:44.708
REGULATORY PROCESS SO IT'S IT'S

02:44:44.774 --> 02:44:45.842
ANOTHER PIECE OF SORT OF

02:44:45.909 --> 02:44:47.177
SUPPORTING THAT BIGGER PICTURE

02:44:47.244 --> 02:44:49.246
BUT IT IS A SEPARATE PEACE AND

02:44:49.312 --> 02:44:51.047
AND SO THAT THE BUDGET INCLUDES

02:44:51.114 --> 02:44:52.449
FUNDING AND STAFFING TO GET THIS

02:44:52.515 --> 02:44:53.783
PROGRAM OFF THE GROUND BUT IT'S

02:44:53.850 --> 02:44:54.985
A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR WHY.

02:44:55.051 --> 02:44:57.120
THAT LEVEL AND EXACTLY HOW MANY

02:44:57.187 --> 02:44:58.922
LANDOWNERS DUE TO THE ENVISION

02:44:58.989 --> 02:45:00.924
BEING ABLE TO HELP AND AND

02:45:00.991 --> 02:45:02.192
WHAT'S THE MAGNITUDE OF

02:45:02.259 --> 02:45:03.593
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY FEEL.

02:45:03.660 --> 02:45:05.328
THEY CAN PROVIDE AND AND HOW

02:45:05.395 --> 02:45:07.697
MIGHT THAT AFFECT OUTCOMES -- OF

02:45:07.764 --> 02:45:09.299
THE PROGRAM AND SO THERE'S

02:45:09.366 --> 02:45:11.067
PROBABLY SOME MORE ROOM THERE

02:45:11.134 --> 02:45:12.202
FOR YOU TO GET INFORMATION ON

02:45:12.269 --> 02:45:13.570
THAT AND MAKE SURE JUST LINES UP

02:45:13.637 --> 02:45:14.838
WITH IS THIS WHAT YOU THOUGHT

02:45:14.904 --> 02:45:18.575
YOU WERE PROVING WHEN YOU PASSED

02:45:18.642 --> 02:45:19.309
AS BEING I KNOW.

02:45:19.376 --> 02:45:19.976
ONE AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:45:20.043 --> 02:45:20.644
NEAR TERM QUESTIONS WE HAVE SOME

02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:21.878
THAT RELATE TO TO SOME OF THE

02:45:21.945 --> 02:45:23.179
OTHER PROGRAMS TO AND AND

02:45:23.246 --> 02:45:24.047
THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES IN THE

02:45:24.114 --> 02:45:26.283
UTILITY SIDE BUT I WON'T GO INTO

02:45:26.349 --> 02:45:26.950
THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT PART OF

02:45:27.017 --> 02:45:27.984
THIS ITEM.

02:45:28.051 --> 02:45:30.387
AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THIS AND

02:45:30.453 --> 02:45:32.422
THIS TOPIC AND JUST OVERSIGHT OF

02:45:32.489 --> 02:45:33.723
THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IS

02:45:33.790 --> 02:45:34.591
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

02:45:34.658 --> 02:45:36.092
REQUIRE A LOT OF LONG TERM

02:45:36.159 --> 02:45:37.193
OVERSIGHT.

02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:38.528
AND THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IT

02:45:38.595 --> 02:45:40.063
AS BEING I NO ONE IN PARTICULAR

02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:42.832
IS YOU NOW IS FOCUSING ON FOREST

02:45:42.899 --> 02:45:44.501
HEALTH FORSTER BECOME HEALTHY IN

02:45:44.567 --> 02:45:45.402
ONE BUDGET YEAR THEY DON'T

02:45:45.468 --> 02:45:46.703
BECOME HEALTHY FROM ONE

02:45:46.770 --> 02:45:47.804
APPROPRIATION OF FINES OR WHEN

02:45:47.871 --> 02:45:49.072
GRANT CYCLE.

02:45:49.139 --> 02:45:50.507
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE --

02:45:50.573 --> 02:45:53.443
A VERY LONG TIME AND SO I WE DO

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:56.880
HE WE DO HIGHLIGHT SAM SAM --

02:45:56.946 --> 02:45:58.715
QUESTIONS OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS

02:45:58.782 --> 02:46:01.985
FOR YOU THERE AND HOW IS THE

02:46:02.052 --> 02:46:02.485
ADMINISTRATION MEASURING

02:46:02.552 --> 02:46:03.320
OUTCOMES.

02:46:03.386 --> 02:46:04.454
YOU KNOW OUR OUR FORESTS

02:46:04.521 --> 02:46:06.623
HEALTHIER AT HOW HOW DO YOU

02:46:06.690 --> 02:46:08.091
DEFINE WHEN THEY'RE HEALTHY.

02:46:08.158 --> 02:46:09.793
AND AND HOW RE MEASURING

02:46:09.859 --> 02:46:10.660
OUTCOMES HARRY MEASURING

02:46:10.727 --> 02:46:13.296
OUTCOMES OVER TIME IS -- WAITED

02:46:13.363 --> 02:46:15.065
YOU KNOW LINK BACK TO MAKING OUR

02:46:15.131 --> 02:46:16.800
FIRST HEALTHIER WITH WILD FIRES

02:46:16.866 --> 02:46:18.535
BEING LESS SEVERE AND THESE ARE

02:46:18.601 --> 02:46:21.237
NOT EASY THINGS AND TO BE ABLE

02:46:21.304 --> 02:46:22.405
TO TRACK THE OUTCOME SIGNED

02:46:22.472 --> 02:46:24.441
THERE'S NO OBVIOUS -- WAY TO DO

02:46:24.507 --> 02:46:26.276
IT BUT THAT SOMETHING THAT OVER

02:46:26.343 --> 02:46:27.677
TIME WE THINK YOU'RE GONNA WANT

02:46:27.744 --> 02:46:29.212
TO CONTINUE TO SUPPRESS

02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:30.914
ADMINISTRATION ON IN QUESTION.

02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:32.582
HOW ARE WE DOING THIS TO ENSURE

02:46:32.649 --> 02:46:33.950
THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED

02:46:34.017 --> 02:46:36.152
EFFECTIVELY -- THE SIMILAR LIVE

02:46:36.219 --> 02:46:37.354
THERE BEING FUNDS ARE BEING

02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:38.855
ALLOCATED TO THE HIGHEST

PRIORITY AREAS AND

GEOGRAPHICALLY PROTECTING

02:46:41.791 --> 02:46:45.695
COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE SEVERE

02:46:45.762 --> 02:46:46.463
VIRUS.

02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:48.031

THESE PROJECTS AND WE'VE HEARD.

ABOUT WORK FORCE BEING

02:46:56.039 --> 02:46:57.607
INSUFFICIENT THAT THERE'S NOT

02:46:57.674 --> 02:46:58.675
EVEN WHEN YOU START GIVING OUT

02:46:58.742 --> 02:47:00.076

WE NEED -- TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:54:01.063 --> 02:54:02.765

THAT'S GONNA INCLUDE NOT ONLY

02:54:18.014 --> 02:54:19.615
THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND THE

02:54:19.682 --> 02:54:21.250
THE IMMEDIATE STRUCTURES IN

02:54:21.317 --> 02:54:22.785
COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE

02:54:22.852 --> 02:54:25.154
THE INTENSITY OF FIRE AS IT

02:54:25.221 --> 02:54:28.558
COMES TO A STRUCTURE -- AND IN

02:54:28.624 --> 02:54:30.126
INCREASES THE SURVIVABILITY OF

02:54:30.193 --> 02:54:31.961

03:07:53.395 --> 03:07:56.331
JUST THROUGH -- DISCUSSIONS AND

03:07:56.398 --> 03:07:58.266
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BETTER --

03:07:58.333 --> 03:08:00.669
BUT WHAT THIS WHAT THIS PROPOSAL

03:08:00.736 --> 03:08:03.105
DOES IS THAT IT ALLOWS US TO GET

03:08:03.171 --> 03:08:04.573
TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:06.108
WHAT THE TRUE.

03:08:06.174 --> 03:08:08.243
HEIR IMPACTS ARE RELATED TO

03:08:08.310 --> 03:08:10.879
PRESCRIBE FIRE BUT THEN ALSO TO

03:08:10.946 --> 03:08:12.447
BE ABLE TO QUIT THAT BACK TO

03:08:12.514 --> 03:08:14.516
WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT

03:08:14.583 --> 03:08:16.351
BETWEEN BETWEEN THAT PRESCRIBED

03:08:16.418 --> 03:08:19.588
FIRE AND WILDFIRE IS BECAUSE

03:08:19.655 --> 03:08:22.057
WILDFIRE -- ISN'T.

03:08:22.124 --> 03:08:23.759
THEN AND IT IS -- AROUND

03:08:23.825 --> 03:08:24.726
STRUCTURES ARE MUCH MORE TALKS

03:08:24.793 --> 03:08:26.728
IT'S BURNING A WHOLE LOT MORE

03:08:26.795 --> 03:08:28.063
STUFF THAN THAN JUST THE

03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:29.931
VEGETATION THAT WE ARE HAVE

03:08:29.998 --> 03:08:32.534
UNDER PRESCRIPTION.

03:08:32.601 --> 03:08:33.969
I GUESS.

03:08:34.036 --> 03:08:34.936
QUESTIONS OF SENTENCES.

03:08:35.003 --> 03:08:35.871
DO YOU BELIEVE IS GOING TO CLOSE

03:08:35.937 --> 03:08:36.805
THE GAP BECAUSE AGAIN OF THE SAY

03:08:36.872 --> 03:08:37.906
IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS WHEN

03:08:37.973 --> 03:08:40.008
THE BIG SEAN'S WE'VE HAD IS WITH

03:08:40.075 --> 03:08:41.043
LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS.

03:08:41.109 --> 03:08:41.743
IN THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE

03:08:41.810 --> 03:08:45.113
CONTROLLED BURNS -- AND SO.

03:08:45.180 --> 03:08:47.249
IS THIS GOING.

03:08:47.315 --> 03:08:48.483
TO ACT MADE GREAT PROGRESS.

03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:50.085
I'M JUST BEING HONEST WE DID NOT

[inaudible]

03:08:53.622 --> 03:08:55.590

SO IS SO RELATED TO CLOSING THE

03:08:57.826 --> 03:08:58.994
GAP I THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK

03:08:59.061 --> 03:09:00.295
TOWARD CLOSING THE GAP AND I

03:09:00.362 --> 03:09:01.530
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO

03:09:01.596 --> 03:09:02.964
ACTUALLY CLOSE THE GAP OR NOT

03:09:03.031 --> 03:09:05.233
UNTIL WE UNTIL WE GET THROUGH

03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:05.434

03:09:31.626 --> 03:09:32.461
AMBITIOUS TREATMENT GOALS

03:09:32.527 --> 03:09:33.829
PRESCRIBE INCREASING USE A

03:09:33.895 --> 03:09:35.764
PRESCRIBED FIRE IS GOING TO BE A

03:09:35.831 --> 03:09:38.200

03:09:46.341 --> 03:09:48.110
DID -- JUST WANTED TO SAY A

03:09:48.176 --> 03:09:48.744
THING.

LEVEL PROTECTIONS I THINK THERE

03:10:12.567 --> 03:10:13.568
WILL ALWAYS BE AN INTERPLAY

03:10:13.635 --> 03:10:15.003
BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR

03:10:15.070 --> 03:10:16.671

03:10:43.632 --> 03:10:44.666
UNDER WHICH PROPOSED WITH THE S.

03:10:44.733 --> 03:10:45.801

AND THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES

03:10:51.506 --> 03:10:53.141
ON THE GROUND WITH BEING ABLE TO

03:10:53.208 --> 03:10:56.244
GET THESE BURNS PERMITTED --

03:10:56.311 --> 03:10:58.213
THAT REMAINS WHETHER IT'S WITH

CAL FIRE OR WITH A FIRE DISTRICT

03:11:00.649 --> 03:11:03.084

A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS ON

REDUCTION AND IT'S BEEN SPREAD

03:17:34.375 --> 03:17:35.710
ACROSS ACROSS A COUPLE OF

LANGUAGE OR WHATEVER IS MAKING

03:17:53.595 --> 03:17:55.129
SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY GETTING

03:17:55.196 --> 03:17:57.065
THAT INTERAGENCY COORDINATION.

03:17:57.131 --> 03:17:58.066
SO THAT THIS.

03:17:58.132 --> 03:18:00.635
I MEAN COLLECTIVELY THIS IS

03:18:00.702 --> 03:18:02.470
AMONGST THE BIGGEST INVESTMENTS

03:18:02.537 --> 03:18:04.572
THE STATE HAS MADE AND CLIMATE

03:18:04.639 --> 03:18:06.441
RESILIENCE AND FOREST IN

03:18:06.507 --> 03:18:08.643
WATERSHEDS THAT WE HAVE SEEN I

03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:09.711
MEAN THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT.

03:18:09.777 --> 03:18:12.280
AMOUNT OF FUNDING OF STAFF LET'S

03:18:12.347 --> 03:18:13.348
MAKE SURE ALSO DOING SOME

03:18:13.414 --> 03:18:14.315

03:18:14.382 --> 03:18:15.617
IMPLEMENTING FORCE CARBON PLAN

03:18:15.683 --> 03:18:18.453
GOALS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

03:18:18.519 --> 03:18:20.121
OF ACRES A YEAR OF YOU KNOW

03:18:20.188 --> 03:18:21.322
FUELS MANAGEMENT VEGETATION

03:18:21.389 --> 03:18:23.625
MANAGEMENT HABITAT MODIFICATION.

03:18:23.691 --> 03:18:24.692
THEY WERE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING

03:18:24.759 --> 03:18:26.394
IMPROVE WATERSHED RESILIENCE

03:18:26.461 --> 03:18:28.062
GOING FORWARD AND GETTING THAT --

03:18:28.129 --> 03:18:29.697
INTERAGENCY COORDINATION LET'S

03:18:29.764 --> 03:18:30.798
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING

03:18:30.865 --> 03:18:32.533
PROACTIVE AND NOT JUST LOOKING

03:18:32.600 --> 03:18:34.102
AT THE IMPACTS OF PROJECTS THAT

03:18:34.168 --> 03:18:35.203
HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED.

03:18:35.270 --> 03:18:39.173
I THINK THAT THAT'S TO SOMETHING

03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:41.142
TO BE AWARE OF GOING BACK TO

03:18:41.209 --> 03:18:42.010
SOMETHING THIS ANGER STERN HAD

03:18:42.076 --> 03:18:42.510
RAISED IN TERMS OF THE

03:18:42.577 --> 03:18:45.880
PRIORITIZATION OF HOW TO UTILIZE

03:18:45.947 --> 03:18:47.348
THE FUNDING THAT CAL FIRE IS

03:18:47.415 --> 03:18:48.249
USING.

03:18:48.316 --> 03:18:49.250
YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE

03:18:49.317 --> 03:18:50.218
OF LEAVING THAT TO THE

03:18:50.285 --> 03:18:51.753
DISCRETION OF THE DEPARTMENT TO

03:18:51.819 --> 03:18:53.054
SORT OF ADAPT TO THE SITUATION

03:18:53.121 --> 03:18:55.423
OF THE YEAR -- SOMETIMES THAT'S

03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:56.624
GOING TO BE WEIGHTED MORE

03:18:56.691 --> 03:18:57.859
HEAVILY TOWARDS SPECIFIC AROUND

03:18:57.925 --> 03:18:59.093
THE COMMUNITY.

03:18:59.160 --> 03:19:01.396
ACTIVITIES WE ALSO NEED TO BE

03:19:01.462 --> 03:19:02.964
MAKING INVESTMENTS AND WATERS

03:19:03.031 --> 03:19:04.632
AND RESILIENCE AND WE HAD A

03:19:04.699 --> 03:19:06.367
CONVERSATION IN THIS VERY ROOM

03:19:06.434 --> 03:19:08.736
TWO DAYS AGO ON A BOND TO GET

03:19:08.803 --> 03:19:09.137
THERE.

03:19:09.203 --> 03:19:10.805
THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST

03:19:10.872 --> 03:19:12.173
SOURCE OF FUNDING TO BE MOVING

03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:13.608
FORWARD ON SORT OF WATERSHED

03:19:13.675 --> 03:19:15.910
RESILIENCE IN KEY AREAS THAT WE

03:19:15.977 --> 03:19:17.745
HAVE SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

03:19:17.812 --> 03:19:18.279
IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THAT

03:19:18.346 --> 03:19:19.414
LATITUDE.

03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:21.516
IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE OTHER

THERE'S ANY OTHER VEHICLES FOR

03:19:25.753 --> 03:19:27.388
THAT AND I'M LOOKING AT THE THE

03:19:27.455 --> 03:19:28.790

CARRYING A B. THIRTY EIGHT WHICH

03:19:31.559 --> 03:19:33.027
HAS BOTH -- MORE ROBUST

03:19:33.094 --> 03:19:35.930
INSPECTION PROCESS EASIER TRYING

03:19:35.997 --> 03:19:37.098
GET AFTER THAT LOW -- LOW

03:19:37.165 --> 03:19:39.834
INTEREST LOAN PROGRAM FOR

03:19:39.901 --> 03:19:40.668
RETROFIT SOME OF THOSE THINGS.

03:19:40.735 --> 03:19:41.836
I WOULD URGE US TO MAINTAIN

03:19:41.903 --> 03:19:44.105
STABILITY IN THESE PROGRAMS AS

03:19:44.172 --> 03:19:45.540

THE GRANT PROGRAM TO TALK A

03:19:47.075 --> 03:19:47.575
LITTLE BIT OF BUILDING WORK

03:19:47.642 --> 03:19:48.943

03:32:12.820 --> 03:32:14.555
PROGRAM THAT WE DID WITH CAL

03:32:14.621 --> 03:32:17.224
FIRE AND DISTRICTS LAST YEAR AND

03:32:17.291 --> 03:32:18.058
WHAT WE DID IN THIS PILOT

03:32:18.125 --> 03:32:19.827
PROGRAM IS WE PUT MONITORS OUT

03:32:19.893 --> 03:32:21.562
AND SO WE COULD MONITOR AIR

03:32:21.628 --> 03:32:23.097
QUALITY AND METEOROLOGICAL

03:32:23.163 --> 03:32:24.231
CONDITIONS.

03:32:24.298 --> 03:32:26.366
OUT AROUND PRESCRIBED FIRES AND

03:32:26.433 --> 03:32:28.202
OUR GOAL WAS TO SEE COULD WE

03:32:28.268 --> 03:32:30.604
ACTUALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

03:32:30.671 --> 03:32:32.339
ACREAGE AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS

03:32:32.406 --> 03:32:33.607
THAT PEOPLE COULD BURN SO WE'RE

03:32:33.674 --> 03:32:34.808
TRYING TO BE PART OF THE

03:32:34.875 --> 03:32:36.743
SOLUTION HERE AND LOOK AT HOW

03:32:36.810 --> 03:32:38.145
CAN WE DO BETTER TO THE TEAM.

03:32:38.212 --> 03:32:39.813
PART OF THE TEAM RIGHT WE WANT

03:32:39.880 --> 03:32:41.415
TO PROTECT THEIR QUALITY PROTECT

03:32:41.482 --> 03:32:43.117
THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN THESE AREAS

03:32:43.183 --> 03:32:44.551
BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THE

03:32:44.618 --> 03:32:46.320
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING MORE

03:32:46.386 --> 03:32:47.454
PRESCRIBED FIRE.

03:32:47.521 --> 03:32:48.922
THIS PILOT WAS SUCCESSFUL

03:32:48.989 --> 03:32:50.791
THEY'RE ACTUALLY CASES WHERE YOU

03:32:50.858 --> 03:32:52.259
KNOW WE COULD CALL UP CAL FIRE

03:32:52.326 --> 03:32:53.894
AND SAY HEY BEER QUALITY LOOKS

03:32:53.961 --> 03:32:55.929
GOOD OUT THERE YOU CAN CONTINUE

03:32:55.996 --> 03:32:56.830
TO BURN.

03:32:56.897 --> 03:32:58.799
AND SO THESE REQUESTED RESOURCES

03:32:58.866 --> 03:33:00.100
ARE GOING TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL

03:33:00.167 --> 03:33:02.236
AIR MONITORING FOR AN INCREASED

03:33:02.302 --> 03:33:03.604
NUMBER PRESCRIBED FIRES.

03:33:03.670 --> 03:33:05.606
ON IT ALSO HAS A COMPONENT OF

03:33:05.672 --> 03:33:07.708
IMPROVE SMOKE MODELING THAT'S

03:33:07.774 --> 03:33:09.143
GONNA HELP US REFINE.

03:33:09.209 --> 03:33:11.512
AND SORT OF THE IMPACTS OF FIRE

03:33:11.578 --> 03:33:13.046
THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE

03:33:13.113 --> 03:33:15.582
USE AN ONLINE TOOL THAT WE

03:33:15.649 --> 03:33:17.084
CALLED P. FURS.

03:33:17.151 --> 03:33:18.252
AND THAT BASICALLY IS THE

03:33:18.318 --> 03:33:20.053
PRESCRIBED FIRE APPROVAL IT'S

03:33:20.120 --> 03:33:21.655
LIKE AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM US

03:33:21.722 --> 03:33:23.657
FOREST SERVICE CAL FIRE AND

03:33:23.724 --> 03:33:24.992
OTHER FOLKS USE IT.

03:33:25.058 --> 03:33:29.763
AND IT'S THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM

03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:31.231
WE USE THAT FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE

03:33:31.298 --> 03:33:31.832
APPROVAL AND REPORTING.

03:33:31.899 --> 03:33:32.566
THAT SYSTEM WILL ALSO ALLOW US

03:33:32.633 --> 03:33:33.734
TO TRACK WHETHER WE'RE ACTUALLY

03:33:33.800 --> 03:33:35.936
SEEING INCREASES AND PRESCRIBED

03:33:36.003 --> 03:33:37.471
FIRE SO THAT'S KIND OF A IT'S A

03:33:37.538 --> 03:33:39.006
WAY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE

03:33:39.072 --> 03:33:39.907
METRICS.

03:33:39.973 --> 03:33:41.608
ON FINALLY THESE REQUESTED

03:33:41.675 --> 03:33:43.043
RESOURCES ARE ALSO GOING TO

03:33:43.110 --> 03:33:44.511
ENABLE US TO EXPAND OUR PUBLIC

03:33:44.578 --> 03:33:45.712
OUTREACH EFFORTS AND TO

03:33:45.779 --> 03:33:47.147
COORDINATE MORE COMMON MESSAGING

03:33:47.214 --> 03:33:48.782
WITH OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE

03:33:48.849 --> 03:33:50.184
WORKING ON OUTREACH.

03:33:50.250 --> 03:33:52.686
WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS MODELING

03:33:52.753 --> 03:33:53.921
THAT AGAIN THIS IS?

03:33:53.987 --> 03:33:55.722
MAYBE I'M SHOWING MY AGE IVETE

03:33:55.789 --> 03:33:57.457
WE'RE IN A WE'RE IN MARCH IT

03:33:57.524 --> 03:33:58.692
RAINS.

03:33:58.759 --> 03:34:00.727
IT STRUCK IT'S CLEAR IT RAINS

03:34:00.794 --> 03:34:02.362
IT'S CLEAR IT RAIN SIX CLEVER

03:34:02.429 --> 03:34:05.499
SORT OF GO THROUGH THIS THIS.

03:34:05.566 --> 03:34:08.268
GOOD AIR QUALITY TIME IS IT IS

03:34:08.335 --> 03:34:10.504
IT IS THE MODELING WHEN WE HAVE

03:34:10.571 --> 03:34:12.239
SPRING WE HAVE THIS OFF AND ON

03:34:12.306 --> 03:34:14.608
RAIN THAT YOU WOULD BE DOING

03:34:14.675 --> 03:34:15.976
THOSE BURNS.

03:34:16.043 --> 03:34:17.945
AFTER THE RAINS YOU KNOW BEFORE

03:34:18.011 --> 03:34:20.214
WE KNOW ANOTHER STORM SYSTEMS

03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:21.582
COMING IN YOU SAY OKAY.

03:34:21.648 --> 03:34:23.483
DO YOUR BURNED AND THEN.

03:34:23.550 --> 03:34:25.452
IS THAT ONE OF THESE MODELS I

03:34:25.519 --> 03:34:27.054
GUESS IS MY QUESTION SO WHAT

03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:29.423
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS BOLD WEATHER.

03:34:29.489 --> 03:34:31.058
AND SMOKE SO WHAT WE WANT TO

03:34:31.124 --> 03:34:33.060
KNOW IS IS THE SMOKE GOING TO BE

03:34:33.126 --> 03:34:34.628
STUCK CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND

03:34:34.695 --> 03:34:36.230
THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NEAR

03:34:36.296 --> 03:34:37.464
WHERE THIS PRESCRIBED FIRES

03:34:37.531 --> 03:34:39.099
COMING ARE THEY GOING TO BE.

03:34:39.166 --> 03:34:42.202
INUNDATED WITH THE SMOKE OR IS

03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:43.403
IT A SITUATION WHERE YOUR

03:34:43.470 --> 03:34:44.972
INVERSION LAYERS HIRED YOUR

03:34:45.038 --> 03:34:46.406
SMOKE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

03:34:46.473 --> 03:34:48.342
SORT OF DISSIPATE AND MOVE

03:34:48.408 --> 03:34:50.510
AROUND -- SO WHAT WORDS SO

03:34:50.577 --> 03:34:51.511
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET

03:34:51.578 --> 03:34:54.715
IMPROVED INFORMATION TO LOOK AT

03:34:54.781 --> 03:34:56.883
IN MY UNDERSTANDING AND I DON'T

03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:57.851
KNOW IF THE CHIEF IS STILL HERE.

03:34:57.918 --> 03:34:59.853
NO PRESCRIBED FIRE SEASON IS

03:34:59.920 --> 03:35:01.355
STARTING TO COME UP WE'RE

03:35:01.421 --> 03:35:03.056
LOOKING AT SORT OF LATE SPRING.

03:35:03.123 --> 03:35:05.225
AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A QUICK

03:35:05.292 --> 03:35:06.627
MEANT THAT WE HAVE PURCHASED

03:35:06.693 --> 03:35:08.495
USING LAST YEAR'S MONEY LAST

03:35:08.562 --> 03:35:09.997
FISCAL YEARS FINDING.

03:35:10.063 --> 03:35:12.132
THAT WE ARE AND PLANNING TO HAVE

03:35:12.199 --> 03:35:14.334
READY FOR THIS PRESCRIBED FIRE

03:35:14.401 --> 03:35:15.769
SEASON SO THAT WE CAN START

03:35:15.836 --> 03:35:17.371
MAKING THESE IMPROVEMENTS AND

03:35:17.437 --> 03:35:19.973
START BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE --

03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:22.009
PRECISE I GUESS THE YOU KNOW I

03:35:22.075 --> 03:35:23.343
AGAIN I'M GONNA BE.

03:35:23.410 --> 03:35:25.946
INELEGANT HERE IS THAT IS THAT

03:35:26.013 --> 03:35:27.981
WE KNOW THAT IF THERE'S BURNS IT

03:35:28.048 --> 03:35:30.684
THE IT MAY BE A NUISANCE FOR FOR

03:35:30.751 --> 03:35:31.885
THAT THAT THE PEOPLE THERE IT

03:35:31.952 --> 03:35:32.886
MAY BE.

03:35:32.953 --> 03:35:35.422
IT MAY GO IF WE'RE FOR SAYING

03:35:35.489 --> 03:35:37.024
THE TOLERANCE LEVEL IS ONE

03:35:37.090 --> 03:35:40.861
HUNDRED MAKE A 1-001-100-2100

03:35:40.927 --> 03:35:41.461
FOUR ONE HUNDRED FIVE BUT BUT

03:35:41.528 --> 03:35:45.365
THE DEATH ZONE IS SO INUNDATED

03:35:45.432 --> 03:35:46.366
WITH.

03:35:46.433 --> 03:35:48.669
TIMBER AND WITH WITH -- FUEL

03:35:48.735 --> 03:35:49.936
THAT AND IT'S ONE OF THE

03:35:50.003 --> 03:35:52.039
IDENTIFIED HOT SPOTS THAT WE

03:35:52.105 --> 03:35:53.273
THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A

03:35:53.340 --> 03:35:54.341
THIS COULD BE A FIRE SO EVEN IF

03:35:54.408 --> 03:35:59.546
IT.

03:35:59.613 --> 03:36:00.080
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MEET.

03:36:00.147 --> 03:36:02.049
THE GUIDELINES THAT WE HAVE FOR

03:36:02.115 --> 03:36:03.383
THE ERROR -- CALL AIR QUALITY.

03:36:03.450 --> 03:36:05.118
WHO MAKES THAT DECISION TO SAY?

03:36:05.185 --> 03:36:06.987
HEY BEEN ESPECIALLY AS WE GET

03:36:07.054 --> 03:36:08.188
CLOSE TO THE FIRE SEASON YOU

03:36:08.255 --> 03:36:09.423
KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A IT'S A

03:36:09.489 --> 03:36:11.758
JUDGMENT CALL ON THESE THINGS

03:36:11.825 --> 03:36:12.059
WERE.

03:36:12.125 --> 03:36:13.994
BLOCKED OFF STIPULATED IT'S A

03:36:14.061 --> 03:36:15.696
NEW SENSE AT ALL STIPULATED THAT

03:36:15.762 --> 03:36:18.165
IT EXCEEDS THE TECHNICAL LIMITS

03:36:18.231 --> 03:36:19.933
THAT YOU HAVE I THINK THAT THE

03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:21.568
END OF THE THE PUBLIC ONCE SAID

03:36:21.635 --> 03:36:22.269
INSURANCE.

03:36:22.336 --> 03:36:24.905
THAT WERE PART OF THE TEAM AND

03:36:24.971 --> 03:36:26.773
THOUGH A BIT AND IN THE IT MAY

03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:28.842
EXCEED THE AIR QUALITY NUMBER

03:36:28.909 --> 03:36:31.311
FOR THIS DAY AT THIS HOUR.

03:36:31.378 --> 03:36:33.947
THE BIG PICTURE WITH THE FIRE OR

03:36:34.014 --> 03:36:36.049
THE POTENTIAL FIRES IS GONNA BE

03:36:36.116 --> 03:36:38.852
CATASTROPHIC A GUIDE YES IT IS --

03:36:38.919 --> 03:36:40.087
I I KNOW I THINK THAT THIS IS

03:36:40.153 --> 03:36:41.421
IT'S A IT'S A REALLY CHALLENGING

03:36:41.488 --> 03:36:43.657
AREA AND YOU KNOW I I WAS ON A

03:36:43.724 --> 03:36:45.625
PANEL A COUPLE MONTHS AGO NOW

03:36:45.692 --> 03:36:47.160
WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO'S.

03:36:47.227 --> 03:36:49.363
KIND OF A HE'S A FIRE EXPERT AND

03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:52.165
HE LIVES OUTSIDE SEQUOIA

03:36:52.232 --> 03:36:53.567
NATIONAL PARK AND HE TOLD THE

03:36:53.633 --> 03:36:54.568
ANECDOTE WHEN HE WAS ON THE

03:36:54.634 --> 03:36:55.736
PANEL HE SAYS YOU KNOW HE'S A

03:36:55.802 --> 03:36:57.537
FIRE EXPERT HE UNDERSTANDS THE

03:36:57.604 --> 03:36:59.072
ROLE OF FIRE THE NEED FOR

03:36:59.139 --> 03:37:01.241
PRESCRIBED FIRE THE ACCESS

03:37:01.308 --> 03:37:02.008
LOADING THAT WE HAVE IN.

03:37:02.075 --> 03:37:04.277
OUR FORESTS HIS TOWN IS ONE OF

03:37:04.344 --> 03:37:06.346
THE TOWNS THAT IS IMPACTED WHEN

03:37:06.413 --> 03:37:08.048
THERE IS PRESCRIBED FIRE BECAUSE

03:37:08.115 --> 03:37:09.282
THEY GET SMOKE WHEN THERE'S

03:37:09.349 --> 03:37:10.684
PRESCRIBED FIRE EVEN WHEN WE

03:37:10.751 --> 03:37:12.085
MAKE A GOOD BURN CALL THEY GET

03:37:12.152 --> 03:37:13.420
SMOKE.

03:37:13.487 --> 03:37:14.855
AND HE SAID HE SAYS YOU KNOW.

03:37:14.921 --> 03:37:17.224
IT IRRITATES ME I DON'T LIKE IT

03:37:17.290 --> 03:37:18.125
WHEN THERE'S FIRE THEIR

03:37:18.191 --> 03:37:20.794
INTELLECTUALLY I KNOW.

03:37:20.861 --> 03:37:22.396
THAT THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE

03:37:22.462 --> 03:37:24.598
NEED TO DO AND HE'S SORT OF AN

03:37:24.664 --> 03:37:26.099
EXPERT IN THIS AREA.

03:37:26.166 --> 03:37:27.033
SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

03:37:27.100 --> 03:37:28.869
TRYING TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE

03:37:28.935 --> 03:37:30.604
CAN PROVIDE AND YET THAT'S SORT

03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:31.605
OF AN IRRITATION FACTOR BUT I

03:37:31.671 --> 03:37:32.539
THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE

03:37:32.606 --> 03:37:34.040
HAVE TO CONSIDER IS THAT SMOKE

03:37:34.107 --> 03:37:35.809
REALLY IS A HEALTH RISK. FOR

03:37:35.876 --> 03:37:37.310
SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW FOR THE

03:37:37.377 --> 03:37:39.379
YOUNG FOR THE AGE FOR THE FOR

03:37:39.446 --> 03:37:40.714
THE ILL.

03:37:40.781 --> 03:37:43.817
AND SO -- STATE LAW SAYS THAT

03:37:43.884 --> 03:37:45.051
THE WAY THAT WE MAKE THESE BIRD

03:37:45.118 --> 03:37:47.020
CALLS HIS DISTRICTS HAVE THE

03:37:47.087 --> 03:37:50.123
ULTIMATE -- SAY ON WHO'S GONNA

03:37:50.190 --> 03:37:51.525
BURN HOW MANY ACRES THEY'RE

03:37:51.591 --> 03:37:53.193
GONNA BURN AND WHERE THEY CAN

03:37:53.260 --> 03:38:01.968
BURN IN THESE AREAS.

03:38:02.035 --> 03:38:02.602
SYSTEM AS PROVIDE THEM WITH AS

03:38:02.669 --> 03:38:03.470
MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE SO

03:38:03.537 --> 03:38:04.304
THAT WE CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS

03:38:04.371 --> 03:38:04.938
AND WE CAN BE AS EXPANSIVE AS

03:38:05.005 --> 03:38:05.505
POSSIBLE WHEN WE MAKE THESE

03:38:05.572 --> 03:38:05.806
DECISIONS?

03:38:05.872 --> 03:38:07.340
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:38:07.407 --> 03:38:08.975
YOU'RE SAYING AND I THINK IT IS

03:38:09.042 --> 03:38:10.377
IT'S IS REALLY TOUGH BALANCE

03:38:10.444 --> 03:38:11.311
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE

03:38:11.378 --> 03:38:12.546
BETWEEN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC

03:38:12.612 --> 03:38:14.347
HEALTH WHEN WE ARE IN NO THAT

03:38:14.414 --> 03:38:16.049
WE'RE SETTING A FIRE.

03:38:16.116 --> 03:38:19.252
VERSES THE HUGE VOLUME OF WORK

03:38:19.319 --> 03:38:21.321
THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MANAGE OUR

03:38:21.388 --> 03:38:23.757
FORCING AND RESTORE FIRE INTO

03:38:23.824 --> 03:38:27.427
THE INTO THE MAR OUR WILD LANDS.

03:38:27.494 --> 03:38:29.162
DOWN MATES.

03:38:29.229 --> 03:38:30.363
LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING BRIEFLY IF

03:38:30.430 --> 03:38:30.964
I MAY LIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF
