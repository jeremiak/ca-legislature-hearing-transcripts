WILL ALSO BE AS WORKING WITH ME

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:47.011
ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:49.614
THANK YOU VICE TREND MEMBERS AB

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.248
FIVE THIRTY NINE IS AN IMPORTANT

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:52.049
CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL THAT IS

00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:53.584
YEARS OVERDUE.

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.086
THE UNDER UNREGULATED INTEREST

00:35:55.152 --> 00:35:56.420
RATE ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.322
HAS LED TO AN EXPLOSION OF HIGH

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:00.558
COST LOANS OVER THE PAST DECADE

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:02.960
THESE LOANS START AT TWO TWENTY

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:03.561
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HAVE

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:05.329
INTEREST RATES FROM A HUNDRED TO

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:06.764
MORE THAN 2100%.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.299
FAR TOO OFTEN CONSUMERS ARE

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.467
UNABLE TO REPLACE THESE

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:11.736
EXPENSIVE LOANS DATA PROVIDED BY

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:13.437
HAAS HI COST LENDERS TO OUR

00:36:13.504 --> 00:36:14.539
STATE REGULATORS SHOW THAT

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:16.541
APPROXIMATELY ONE OUT OF THREE

00:36:16.607 --> 00:36:19.243
LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF BY LENDERS.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.646
BUT A WRITTEN OFF ALONE IS NOT

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.214
THE END OF THE STORY LENDERS

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:24.549
SELL THESE WRITTEN OFF LOANS TO

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.384
DEBT COLLECTORS WHO REMITTANCE

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.720
RELENTLESSLY PURSUE CONSUMERS

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:30.555
FOR THE AMOUNT OWED.

00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:31.556
THIS PROCESS RESULTS IN DAMAGE

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:32.990
CREDIT FOR CONSUMERS AND CAN

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:34.892
LEAD TO THEIR PAYCHECKS BEING

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:36.494
GARNISH THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:38.296
CLOSED OR THEIR CAR BEING

00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:40.965
REPOSSESSED. ONE OUT OF THREE

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:43.067
TIMES.

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.435
AND I CANNOT THINK OF ANY OTHER

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:46.304
PRODUCT THAT FEELS SO OFTEN

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.072
WITHOUT GOVERNMENT STEPPING IN

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:49.440
TO INTERVENE.

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:50.975
HI COST LENDERS WHO OPPOSE THIS

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:52.343
BILL SAY THAT THEY NEED TO

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.312
CHARGE SUCH HIGH RATES TO MAKE

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:55.813
UP FOR CONSUMERS WHO DEFAULT.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.515
BUT THESE RATES PLAY A CRITICAL

00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:59.116
ROLE IN MAKING THESE LOANS AND

00:36:59.183 --> 00:37:01.118
AFFORDABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:02.753
LET'S WALK THROUGH A COMPARISON.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.722
TAKE IN TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A TWO

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:05.856
YEAR TWENTY SIX HUNDRED LOAN

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:08.259
WHICH IS A FAIRLY COMMON PRODUCT

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.161
IN THE MARKET.

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:11.262
IF THE CONSUMER GET THIS LOAN

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:12.496
FROM A RESPONSIBLE THE LENDER

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.165
CHARGING 36% THEIR MONTHLY

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:15.499
PAYMENT WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:17.101
AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND THEY WOULD

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:19.103
PAY BACK A TOTAL OF THIRTY SEVEN

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.271
HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.372
THE LOAN.

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:22.640
ON THE OTHER HAND IF A CONSUMER

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:24.008
GETS A LOAN FROM A HIGH COST

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.843
PROVIDER WITH THEIR MONTHLY PAY

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:26.510
THEIR WITH THEIR MONTHLY

00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:29.013
PAYMENTS WOULD JUMP TO FOUR

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.414
HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN AND THEY

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:31.415
WOULD PAY BACK A TOTAL OF A

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:33.584
NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:35.853
AND THAT SAME TWENTY SIX HUNDRED

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.087
DOLLAR.

00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:36.654
LOAN.

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:38.089
ARE WE REALLY WILLING TO BELIEVE

00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:39.624
THAT DEFAULTING ON SUCH A LOAN

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.158
IS DUE TO THE RISKY NESS OF THE

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.227
CONSUMER AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:45.129
SKY HIGH INTEREST RATE CHARGED

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:46.430
BY THE LENDER.

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:48.165
THE OUTCOMES OF THIS UNREGULATED

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:49.634
SPACE ARE CLEAR.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.502
THESE HIGH INTEREST RATES ALLOW

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.504
LENDERS TO REMAIN SUSTAINABLY

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:54.605
PROFITABLE.

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.173
EVEN WHEN ONE THIRD OR MORE OF

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.042
THEIR BARRELS ULTIMATELY DEFAULT

00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.943
ON THE LOAN.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.145
AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WILL PUT A

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:02.046
STOP TO THIS RIGHETTI.

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:03.581
AT RINGGIT RIGID INCENTIVE

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:05.349
STRUCTURE THE IDEA THAT

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.917
CONSUMERS WILL NOT HAVE CREDIT

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.619
OPTIONS IF THIS BILL PASSES IS

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:10.388
NOT REALISTIC THE RESPONSIBLE

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:11.455
LENDERS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:12.890
HAVE FOUND WAYS TO OFFER

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.225
AFFORDABLE CREDIT OPTIONS TO

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:16.560
BARS WITH DAMAGE CREDIT FOR EVEN

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:18.195
NO CREDIT SCORE AT ALL.

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:19.830
AND LET'S BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA IS

00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:22.066
AN OUTLIER WE ARE AMONG A SMALL

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.567
MINORITY OF STATES THAT DO NOT

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:25.102
CAP INTEREST RATES ON THESE

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:27.972
LOANS BOTH RED AND BLUE STATES

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:30.574
CAP THE INTEREST RATES. 80% OF

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:32.610
PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES IN

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:33.544
THE UNITED STATES LIVE IN A

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:35.746
STATE WHERE THE RATE IS CAPPED

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:37.248
ON THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT.

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:39.016
I HAVE WORK TO FIND A COMPROMISE

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:40.584
THAT COULD EARN THE SUPPORT FROM

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.086
BOTH CONSUMER GROUPS AND LENDERS

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.388
ALIKE AND AB FIVE THREE NINE IS

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.090
THE RESULT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS.

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.558
WE HAVE A STRONG AND GROWING

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:49.326
COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:51.195
LABOR ORGANIZATIONS RELIGIOUS

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.963
ORGANIZATIONS AND VETERANS

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.498
GROUPS TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS.

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:56.367
I WILL NOW TURN MY TIME OVER TO

00:38:56.434 --> 00:38:57.702
JOINT AUTHORED A SOME MEMBER TIM

00:38:57.768 --> 00:39:01.739
GRAYSON WHO HAS BEEN A VALUABLE

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:02.273
PARTNER TO MEET WITH THESE

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:03.274
EFFORTS.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:03.908
THANK YOU TO MY JOINT AUTHORED

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:04.842
MADAM CHAIR AS WELL AS VICE

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:06.277
CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:08.212
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I REPRESENTS

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.380
SOME OF THE MORE ECONOMICALLY

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:10.915
DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND THE

00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.450
GREATER BAY AREA.

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:13.551
SINCE MY TIME ON THE CONCORD

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:14.852
CITY COUNCIL I HAVE STRUGGLED

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:16.454
WITH THIS VERY QUESTION OF

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.155
ACCESS OR THE QUESTION OF

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:19.557
INTEREST RATES AND CONSUMER

00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:20.624
PROTECTIONS.

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:22.059
WITH THAT IN MIND I BELIEVE THAT

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:23.828
AB FIVE THIRTY NINE REPRESENTS

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:26.063
THE BEST PUBLIC POLICY BALANCE

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.198
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.966
CONSIDER ON THIS ISSUE IN RECENT

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.034
MEMORY.

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:31.335
WE KNOW THAT SINCE THE START OF

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.204
THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.771
THOUSAND EIGHT THE STATE OF

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.740
CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN AN EXPLOSION

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:37.641
AND HIGH COST PREDATORY LENDING

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:39.243
INTO THE SUBPRIME MARKET.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.379
FROM 200-082-2000 SEVENTEEN THE

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:43.981
LAST YEAR WE HAVE DATA FOR

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:46.050
TRIPLE DIGIT LOAN VOLUMES HAVE

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:49.153
INCREASED OVER 17000%.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.454
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.323
BUSINESS OVERSIGHT APPROXIMATELY

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:53.824
ONE THIRD OF ALL HIGH COST LOANS

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.226
ENDED DEFAULT.

00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:56.360
AND FOR THOSE LOAN SECURED BY A

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:58.362
CAR TITLE THE NEGATIVE OUTCOME

00:39:58.429 --> 00:39:59.497
IS EVEN GREATER BECAUSE

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.831
REPOSSESSION CAN DEPRIVE A

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:03.567
BORROWER OF THEIR ABILITY TO BE

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:04.769
ABLE TO TRAVEL TO THEIR WORK.

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:06.737
MEMBERS I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:07.905
THIS QUESTION.

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:09.406
IS THERE ANY PRODUCT THAT IS

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:11.442
LEGAL TO SELL IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.043
FAILS MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THE

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.411
TIME.

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:16.046
I CERTAINLY CANNOT THINK OF ONE

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:17.915
SO WHY DO WE ALLOW HUNDREDS OF

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:19.283
THOUSANDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.585
FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS TO

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:23.554
CONTINUE TO FACE FINANCIAL RUIN

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:25.356
THROUGH TRIPLE DIGIT LENDING.

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:26.991
AB FIVE THIRTY NINE REPRESENTS A

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:29.193
HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO REIN IN

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.661
PREDATORY LENDING HERE IN THIS

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:31.395
STATE.

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:32.930
YOU WILL HEAR FROM A BROAD

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.265
COALITION OF CONSUMER GROUPS

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.500
LENDERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:38.602
FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS ALL IN

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:40.671
SUPPORT OF FIVE THIRTY NINE THEY

00:40:40.738 --> 00:40:42.706
RIGHTFULLY RECOGNIZE THAT FOR

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:44.375
THAT. FOR TOO LONG THESE

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:45.709
EXORBITANTLY PRICED BLOWN

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:47.444
PRODUCTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY HOPING

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:49.313
CONSUMERS AND THAT ACCESS TO

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.182
CAPITAL CAN NO LONGER BE AN

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:52.116
EFFECTIVE ARGUMENT TO

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:53.884
MAINTAINING THE PREDATORY STATUS

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:54.985
QUO.

00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:57.121
I BELIEVE THAT TODAY THANKS TO

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:57.721
THE HARD WORK OF ALL

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.723
STAKEHOLDERS BUT ESPECIALLY DARK

CHAIR MS Là MOAN AND HER STAFF

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.060
WE HAVE FOUND A BALANCE THAT

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:05.362
WILL ENSURE A ROBUST MARKETPLACE

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:06.630
FOR SMALL DOLLAR LENDING.

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:08.232
WHILE WEEDING OUT THE MOST

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:10.201
EGREGIOUS PRODUCTS SINCE THE

RATES.

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.343
WITHOUT FAIL THEY ARE SHOCKED

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.978
THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED THE CURRENT

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:23.180
MARKET PLACE TO IT TO PERSIST.

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:24.849
I ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN

BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT.

00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:34.317
I'VE READ LETTERS FROM OUR

SITUATIONS THAT PUT HIM INTO

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:54.738
THAT PREDICAMENT -- WE BELIEVE

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:57.207
THAT IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC AREAS

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.009
THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:00.544
TERMS OF CONSUMER REFORMS.

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:01.945
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A DEBATE

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:06.416
ABOUT THOSE AREAS -- WE'VE BEEN

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:07.984
CALLED PREDATORY LENDERS OVER

00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:10.353
NOT PREDATORY LENDERS WERE A

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.322
REGULATED LENDER -- PREDATORY

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:13.757
LENDER THIS.

00:53:13.823 --> 00:53:16.693
IS NOT PREDATORY JUST BY VIRTUE

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.260
OF THE FACT THAT IT'S A HIGH

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:18.295
INTEREST RATE.

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.397
THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED

00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:22.899
WITH BEING PREDATORY LENDERS --

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:25.569
HOWEVER.

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:26.636
THERE WOULD BE ABOUT ONE POINT

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:27.704
THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF ACCESS

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.839
TO CREDIT.

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:31.708
THAT WOULD BE ELIMINATED AS A

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.944
RESULT OF THIS BILL BY THE FACT

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.178

THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK

YOURSELF IS WORDED THESE PEOPLE

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:41.985
GO.

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:44.220
AND WE WOULD -- SAY THAT THEY

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:45.956
WOULD GO TO THE UNREGULATED

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:47.457
MARKET PLACE THAT COULD BE.

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:50.393
A VARIETY OF AREAS COULD BE

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.095
UNREGULATED INTERNET.

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:54.331
COULD BE TRIBAL ENDING THEIR

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:55.565
SOVEREIGN NATIONS ARM.

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:58.034

00:53:58.101 --> 00:53:59.436
WAY THAT OURS ARE REGULATED.

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:00.870
AND BEFORE YOU VOTE ON THIS BILL

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.706
I JUST LIKE YOU DO AT LEAST

00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:04.741
THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT --

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.509
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:08.044
OF THERE ARE STUDIES AND THERE'S

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:09.179
INFORMATION.

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:11.414

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:20.690
THIS AND SEEM TO SAY THAT THERE

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:21.758
WAS NO IMPACT.

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:24.260
ON REDUCING THE INTEREST RATES

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.796
DOWN 236% THERE IS IN FACT AN

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:31.001
IMPACT -- ORGAN OF FOR EXAMPLE

DONE DONE BY DARTMOUTH SO THESE

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:55.525
ARE NOT JUST INDUSTRY STUDIES.

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:57.527

TODAY TO ADDRESS -- FOR ITEMS

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:39.703
FROM THE FACT SHEET THAT WAS

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.104
DISTRIBUTED BY THE AUTHOR.

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:42.706
THE FIRST ONE I'M GOING TO

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:45.275
ADDRESS IS THE THE QUOTE OF THE

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.377
STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING AND I

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:48.178

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:51.047
AGREE MORE WITH THAT QUOTE --

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:53.616
I'VE DISTRIBUTED THIS SHEET HERE

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.151
THESE ARE THE CONSUMER LOAN

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.519
PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO NON PRIME

00:55:56.586 --> 00:55:58.088
CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS

00:55:58.154 --> 00:56:00.457
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:01.424
VOLUME FROM THE DB O. REPORTS.

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:03.059
YOU'LL SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE TWO

00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:04.194
POINT NINE BILLION IN PAYDAY

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.762
LOANS ON THE RIGHT SIDE TWO

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:07.897
POINT SIX BILLION IN OVER TWENTY

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:08.331
FIVE HUNDRED LOANS.

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:09.599
AND YOU'LL SEE THAT GAP IN THE

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:11.468
MIDDLE WITH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:13.203
AND SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND R. SIT

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:15.004
THREE SORRY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:17.207
SEVEN MILLION LOANS BETWEEN --

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:17.807
ZERO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNDER

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:19.142
THE CFL KIND OF THAT GAP IN THE

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:19.843
MIDDLE.

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:21.544
SO THAT THAT LENDING IN THE

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:26.149
MIDDLE REPRESENTS 6% OF THIS

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.016
ENTIRE VOLUME.

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:28.251
IN WHAT NON PRIME CONSUMERS

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:29.719
REALLY NEED.

00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:31.354
IS ALONE IN THE MIDDLE BUT

00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:33.289
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO FIFTY FIVE

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:35.058
AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IF YOU

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:36.760
LOOK AT CLARITY'S NON PRIME ONE

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:38.228
A ONE STUDY.

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:39.662
THE AVERAGE UNSECURED

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:40.930
INSTALLMENT LOAN ACROSS THE US

00:56:40.997 --> 00:56:42.198
IS FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:43.133
DOLLARS.

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:44.834
IF YOU LOOK AT DATA FROM ONE OF

00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:46.669
OUR LARGEST LEGIONS THEM THE

00:56:46.736 --> 00:56:48.404
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THAT

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:50.173
CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA GOING

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.042
ONLINE LOOKING FOR IS JUST OVER.

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.610
NINE HUNDRED THESE NON PRIME

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:56.045
CONSUMERS NEED SOMETHING IN THE

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:58.014
MIDDLE IN CALIFORNIA IS.

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.449
UNUSUAL RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:02.652
THEIR CHOICES MOST OFTEN ARE TWO

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:04.053
FIFTY FIVE OR OVER TWENTY FIVE

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.455
HUNDRED SAID THE STATUS QUO IS

00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:07.557
NOT WORKING I AGREE WITH THAT.

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:10.160
IN IN THIS MIDDLE -- TWO THIRDS

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.628
OF THAT LENDING IS BEING DONE BY

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:13.496
PILOT PROGRAM LANDERS I THINK

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:14.564
PILOT PROGRAMS LOANS ARE

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:17.000
TERRIFIC SOLUTION FOR A SMALL

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.134
SUBSECTION OF NON PRIME

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:19.435
CONSUMERS.

00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:20.970
IN AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF PILOT

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:23.006
PROGRAM LOANS YOU KNOW THE DATA

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:24.274
DEMONSTRATES THAT THEY JUST

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:28.678
CAN'T SERVE KIND OF THE BROADER --

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:30.246
NON PRIME CONSUMER SEGMENT THERE.

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:31.080
EVEN WITH A PILOT PROGRAM

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:33.316
LENDERS WITH THE ABILITY TO GET

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:34.918
UP 259% APR.

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.386
THE SECOND THING ON THE FACT

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:37.921
SHEET I WANT TO ADDRESS IS.

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:39.189
THIS COMPROMISE REFLECTS THE

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:40.824
HIGHER COSTS FOR LENDERS TO

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.091
OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.327
I'M LOST ON THAT -- ONE LAST

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:46.429
YEAR'S BILL WAS 36% A PR THIS

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:48.498
BILL IS 36% PLUS THE FEDERAL

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:50.166
FUNDS RATE WHICH IS ABOUT TWO

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:51.568
TWO AND A HALF PERCENT SO THAT'S

00:57:51.634 --> 00:57:52.902
THIRTY EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT.

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:53.770
SO LEMME JUST STATE FOR THE

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:55.972
RECORD WE CANNOT SERVE OUR

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:57.740
CURRENT CUSTOMERS AT THIRTY

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.309
EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT OR EVEN

00:57:59.375 --> 00:58:01.978
AT 59% WHICH IS UNDER THE PILOT

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:04.781
PROGRAM LOANS LOANS AS HIGH AS

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:06.049
YOU CAN GET IT.

00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:08.284
RIGHT SIX MINUTES IF WE COULD --

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.118
YES CLOSE.

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:11.354
OKAY -- SO I SEE LENDERS SUCH AS

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:12.589
ONE MAN LANDMARK SUPPORTING THIS

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:14.224
BILL IT'S EASY TO COMPARE MY

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.492
COMPANY BETWEEN MY COMPANY IN

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:17.861
ONE MAIN BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH --

00:58:17.927 --> 00:58:19.229
PUBLIC COMPANIES THEY REPORT

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:20.396
THAT THEIR AVERAGE LOAN SIDE FOR

00:58:20.463 --> 00:58:23.132
UNSECURED INSTALLMENT IS.

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:23.666
SEVEN THOUSAND THAT THEIR

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.568
AVERAGE CUSTOMER FICUS SCORE SIX

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:26.135
THIRTY FIVE THAT THE RABBITS

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:27.971
TERMS FIFTY THREE MONTHS THAT'S

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:30.807
FOUR AND A HALF YEARS -- OUR

00:58:30.874 --> 00:58:32.909
AVERAGE IQ SCORE SIX HUNDRED

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:33.810
THAT'S THIRTY FIVE PERCENTAGE

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:35.311
POINTS OF THE DIFFERENT -- OUR

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:37.680
AVERAGE LOAN IS UNDER THREE

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:41.851
THOUSAND VERY DIFFERENT CUSTOMER

00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:45.388
VERY DIFFERENT PRODUCT. ONE OF

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:46.256
THE ADDRESS ONE MORE OF THE FACT

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:47.390
SHEET ITEMS AND THAT'S A TWENTY

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:48.291
SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN OVER

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:49.158
FORTY TWO MONTHS IS A TOTAL

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:51.027
PAYMENT OF TWELVE THOUSAND SIX

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:52.328
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THAT'S

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:53.630
VERY CLOSE TO WHAT OUR LOAN IS

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:54.898
OUR LOAN IS FORTY TWO MONTHS.

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:58.501
AT 132% APR -- I WILL TELL YOU

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.436
WHEN I WAS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:02.372

OUR LOANS ORIGINATED IN.

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:07.243
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ABOUT 1%

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.778
WENT TO THE FULL CONTRACT TERM

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.246
IN THE AVERAGE TERM WAS ACTUALLY

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:11.214
LESS THAN A YEAR.

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:12.749
IN PREPARATION FOR TESTIMONY

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:14.717
TODAY I WENT BACK AND PULLED UP

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.886

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:17.420
LOANS.

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:19.455
AND AGAIN AVERAGE LOAN WAS JUST

00:59:19.522 --> 00:59:20.890
OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED AVERAGE

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:22.725
PAY BACK WAS FORTY SIX HUNDRED

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:24.193
AVERAGE TERM WAS LESS THAN A

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.328
YEAR.

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:27.597
AND ONLY POINT 7% WENT THE FULL

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:30.266
CONTRACT TERM OUR CUSTOMERS ARE

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:33.903

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:35.772
SO I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMITTEE

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:36.339

TODAY I AM A LOT OF WHAT I'M

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.209
HEARING IS THAT THERE'S A DEBATE

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.510
ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL DO IN THE

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:37.346
MARKET. TO ACCESS TO CAPITAL BUT

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:38.714
WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIRTY

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:39.482

SIDES WHAT HAS HAPPENED WE HEARD.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.189

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:47.456
I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT

01:03:47.523 --> 01:03:49.692
IS HAPPENED TO ACCESS TO CAPITAL

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:51.594
IN AS OTHER STATES.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.829
SO 80% SO LET'S BE CLEAR THIS

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:56.766
THIS BILL -- LOOKS AT ONE

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.100

RIGHT AND SO THIS IS REALLY FROM

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.541
250-021-0000 AND AS YOU WILL SEE

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.543

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.011
OF THE UNITED STATES LIVES WITH

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:09.879
A CAP.

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:12.014
ON THAT AND IT THERE CONTINUE TO

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:14.283
BE OTHER OPTIONS I FEEL ONE OF

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.551
THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:16.719
KNOW IS THAT THE REASON THAT WE

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:17.687
HAVE SOME OF THE MORE

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:18.988
RESPONSIBLE LENDERS.

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.590
AS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL IS

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:21.357
BECAUSE THEY WILL STAY IN

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:23.826
BUSINESS -- EIGHT INCLUSIVE WE

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:25.361
WE'VE HAD AN ASSEMBLY DELEGATION

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:26.629
THAT WAS HERE THAT WENT OUT TO

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.898
WASHINGTON DC -- THAT ALSO SAYS

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.299
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.168
NATION WIDE AT IS BEING LOOKED

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:33.035
AT AND FOR CALIFORNIA IS

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.804
REGULATORY STABILITY KNOWING

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.973
THAT THIS IS BEEN A DISCUSSION

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.708
FOR FOURTEEN YEARS IN THE STATE --

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:41.010
AND SO PEOPLE ARE HESITANT AND

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:43.012
SHY TO INVEST IN THE STATE OF

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.714
CALIFORNIA UNTIL THEY KNOW WHAT

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.749
THE RULES WILL BE -- WE HAVE A

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:48.317
UNANIMOUS CALIFORNIA SUPREME

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:49.485
COURT DECISION AS HAS BEEN

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:52.154
NOTICED THAT CALLED THESE RAZA

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.556
LOANS UNCONSCIONABLE.

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.157
AND MEANING THEY DIDN'T QUITE

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.093
KNOW WHAT THE RATE WOULD BE --

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.461
WHAT THE RIGHT RATE WOULD BE BUT

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:00.162
THE RATE THAT IS IN EXISTENCE

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:01.330
AND THE COMPANY THAT WAS

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.866
MENTIONED IN THAT COURT CASE --

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.001
HAD PRETTY HIGH.

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:07.403
NUMBERS AND THEY WERE WELL INTO

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.205
THE HIGH INTEREST AND SO I THINK

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:11.207
WHAT WHAT'S BEING CALLED UPON US

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:12.942
AS A STATE IS ONE TO TO DO

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:14.377
SOMETHING OTHERWISE THE COURTS

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:15.745
WILL DO SOMETHING OR IT WILL BE

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:17.480
DONE THROUGH A BALLOT INITIATIVE --

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:20.583
WE'VE LOOKED AT WHAT HAS

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.118
HAPPENED AGAIN IS IT THROUGH THE

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:24.820
COUNTRY AND THAT 36% COMES FROM

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.422
THE MILITARY LANDING ACT WHICH

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:27.657
CREATED A STANDARD.

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:29.392
PEOPLE CAN DEBATE ON WHETHER THE

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:30.493
STANDARD IS THE RIGHT NUMBER OR

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:31.827
NOT BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:33.296
TREATED THE STANDARD WHICH IS

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:38.301
WHAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH.

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:39.435
THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW I'M.

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:40.403
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:40.903
BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:41.537
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:42.171
BEING EXPLOITED AT THE COST OF

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.005
US NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.974
NEEDS TO STOP BUT I AM CONCERNED

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:47.176
ABOUT -- ESPECIALLY THE FINTECH

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.277
SPACE CREATING OTHER

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:50.513
OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE AREN'T

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.048
REGULATING AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.649
NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL THEY WILL

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.351
TURN TO UNREGULATED MEANS AND

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:56.419
THINGS THAT WILL EXPLOIT THEM

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:57.887
EVEN FURTHER AND SO I THINK AS

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:58.921
WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS.

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:00.423
WE NEED TO BE COMMITTED TO

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.058
LOOKING AT THOSE ALTERNATIVES IN

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:02.625
ENSURING THE WERE REGULATING

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:05.695

SAYING.

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:51.040
SO THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:41.424
CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.125
MY QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT WHAT'S

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.995
THE CAUSE OF A 36% CAP WHERE

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:47.630
SOME CAN CAN CONTINUE TO DO

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:48.864
BUSINESS BUT THESE PARTICULAR

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:51.300
MODELS CAN'T DO BUSINESS.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.736
AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:55.371
WOULD BE THAT -- THERE NEEDS TO

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:58.407
BE COVER FOR THE HIGH RATE OF

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.743
DEFAULTS -- HOWEVER THE SAME

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.011
COMPANIES ARE SAYING THAT THEY

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:04.113
ARE DOING -- A LEVEL OF

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.614
UNDERWRITING.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.651
SO I WOULD I WOULD IMAGINE THAT --

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:11.053
THE MORE DEFAULT YOU HAVE THE

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.155
HIGHER THE INTEREST RATE MUST BE

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.224
SO THAT THERE CAN BE A RECOVERY

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:16.592
TO KEEP THAT PARTICULAR MODEL

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:17.593
WORKING.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.662
AS AS THE THE CHAIR MENTIONED

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.363
THERE ARE A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.199
ARE OUT THERE THIS IS NOT GOING

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.167
TO COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN THE

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.169
SMALL DOLLAR LENDING BUSINESS

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:29.171
WHAT IT IS GOING TO DO IS BRING

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.674
IT TO A PLACE OF A REASONABLE.

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.742
MODEL FOR BUSINESS THAT ALLOWS

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.444
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OUT A

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.279
LOAN TO BE ABLE TO REPAY IT AND

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:39.715
TO WORK THEMSELVES INTO A PRIME

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.450
MARKET AND NOT CONTINUE TO BE IN

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:42.651
A PERPETUAL.

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:45.688
SUBPRIME -- CONDITION AS FAR AS

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:47.823
WHERE THEY WILL GO -- THERE ARE

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:50.059
GOING TO BE I BELIEVE THIS -- I

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.627
THINK WE COULD LEARN AS THE

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:53.462
EXAMPLE WAS MENTIONED -- BY

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.231
OPPOSITION ABOUT AN EXAMPLE IN

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:56.198
OREGON.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:59.101
AND I THINK THE THE STATE THAT

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:01.904
WE HAVE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.639
REBEKAH BAUER CON I BELIEVE THE

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:04.707
THE STATE THAT WE HAVE IS

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:06.442
INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE ENOUGH

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:06.976
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LEARN

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:09.612
LESSONS FROM OTHER STATES THAT

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:10.613
HAVE GONE BEFORE US.

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.414
BAND THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.083
THROUGH -- THROUGH BETTER

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.385
ENFORCEMENT WE CAN ACTUALLY HOPE

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:18.988
NOT REPEAT THOSE SAME MISTAKES

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:19.889
AS FAR AS THEY WHERE WOULD THEY

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:21.323
GO I BELIEVE THEY'LL BE PRODUCTS

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:25.261
THAT.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:25.895
BECAUSE OF THE CERTAINTY THAT'S

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.530
PER I DID IN THE STATE OF

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:28.163
CALIFORNIA FROM A. B. A FIGHTER

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:28.831
I BELIEVE THIS THAT THERE WILL

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:30.199
ACTUALLY BE PRODUCTS THAT

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:32.034
ACTUALLY RISE FROM THIS. FOR A

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:33.536
MORE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO BE

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:34.970
ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:37.306
AS A FOLLOW UP QUIRK QUESTION

THE RATE 236%.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.951
YOU ARE NOT REGULATING AS I READ

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:54.423
THE THE CREDIT RATING -- CREDIT

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.992
INSURANCE.

01:09:57.059 --> 01:10:01.730
IF AND WHEN THEY TRY -- TO MAKE

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.132
UP THE DIFFERENCE Y. LOS.

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:06.201
I CREDIT INSURANCE.

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:09.471
DO YOU MAY NOT -- ACHIEVED WELL

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:11.273
WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE A

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.175
THROUGH THIS BILL.

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.743
I'M SORRY WHAT'S THE QUESTION

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.779
YOU'RE ASKING THE THE CREDIT

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.380
INSURANCE AND THEY MAY THEY MAY

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:19.481
CHARGE.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.817
IN ADDITION TO THE INTEREST RATE

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.519
AND THE QUESTION IS.

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:25.054
WHEN WHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:25.588
WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE CREDIT

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:27.222
INSURANCE?

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:29.158
WHAT WOULD THAT THAT IS A NOT

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:32.328
REGULATING REGULATED BY DISPEL

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:33.696
AND THAT THEY CAN CHARGE

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.898
INJURIES ON TOP OF THAT MAYBE

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:38.133
MAYBE -- OPPOSITION NOW CAN

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.637
ANSWER -- TO THAT.

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:42.938
ACTUALLY THERE IS A LOT OF

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.640
EXCUSE NATURE THERE IS A LOT A

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.208
LOT OF REGULATION ON THAT AND BY

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.910
THE WAY IT'S ACTUALLY AGAINST

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.512
THE LAW -- TO OFFER ALONE AND

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.314
THEN REQUIRE THERE HAD TO BE

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:53.949
ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:55.484
ADDED ON TO IT.

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:58.287
SO IT'S AN OPTION NUMBER ONE AND

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.556
THEN NUMBER TWO THERE ARE --

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.491
THERE ARE RATE REGULATIONS THAT

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.693
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY ON THE

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.195
INSURANCE PRODUCT ITSELF.

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:08.030
SO THAT IF I UNDERSTAND IT

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:08.631
CORRECTLY.

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:11.066
IT WOULD RAISE THE INTEREST RATE --

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:12.901
IF YOU WERE INCLUDING THE ADD ON

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:15.638
OR INSURANCE BUT IT WOULD NOT

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:18.107
EVEN COME REMOTELY CLOSE TO

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.942
WHAT'S BEING OFFERED UP THERE

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.677
NOW IN THE TRIPLE TRIPLE DIGIT.

01:11:21.744 --> 01:11:23.145
OKAY VICE CHAIR CAN I ASK

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.813
OPPOSITION NANA.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.149
I HAVE A QUESTION IF WITH 36% IS

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:30.986
AND NOT WORKABLE AND NOT BY

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.955
ABOUT A WEEK.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:33.889
HAVE YOU.

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:36.458
A SUGGESTED THE AS A COMPROMISE

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:38.861
TO RATE THAT WHAT WILL BE A ON

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:40.429
THE SIDE OF A PROTECTING THE

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:41.697
CONSUMERS HAVE BUT THIS IS YOUR

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.899
BUSINESS CAN OPERATE THAT WAS

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.001
THE ANY COMPROMISE DEVOTION WHAT

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:48.137
INTEREST RATE THAT YOU HAVE

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:49.938
PROPOSED.

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.707
ACTUALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:52.241
THERE'S BEEN NO DISCUSSION

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:53.442
AROUND THAT.

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:56.845
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DPO DATA

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:58.547
THERE IS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION

01:11:58.614 --> 01:12:01.950
IN LOANS BEING DONE OVER 40% APR.

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:02.885
AND WE WILL TALK WHEN WE TALK

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.520
ABOUT THE OTHER LENDERS THAT CAN

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:06.855
OPERATE AT 36% ARE UNDER THE

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.123
LENDER SUCH AS ONE MAN AND ONE

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.324

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.659
BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPLES

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:13.062
AND ORANGES SO FIRST OF ALL.

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.163
THAT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:15.831
LOAN VOLUME THAT'S BEING DONE --

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:17.966
OVER 40% APR.

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.535
THEY CAN THEY CAN BE DOING THAT

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:22.538
LOAN VOLUME TODAY IF THEY WANTED

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:23.105
TO AND WE WOULD BE OUT OF

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.339
BUSINESS.

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:25.574
BUT THEIR PRODUCT IN THERE

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.609
CONSUMER IS IN THEIR BUSINESS

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.211
MODEL ISVERY DIFFERENT FROM

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.280
OURS SO TO THINK THAT IF WE'RE

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.182
NOT HERE LENDING TO OUR

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:35.484
CUSTOMERS THAT OTHER LENDERS.

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.785
CAN STEP IN AND LEAD TO THOSE.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.220
CUSTOMERS THAT ARE DEEPER IN THE

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:43.292
FIGHT GOES SCORE RANGE AT 36% OR

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:43.892
LESS THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.994

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:50.699
SO WITH.

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:53.869
IF AND WHEN -- THIS PASSES.

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.738
WHAT DO YOU?

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:56.638
PREDICT.

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.006

THANK YOU I I APOLOGIZE I DON'T

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.001
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE TURN IF THEY

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:46.735
THINK A NUMBER OF FOLKS --

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.537

THAT'S TRUE -- I GUESS WE'LL

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.776
JUST A FALL QUESTION WHAT DO WE

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:56.578
KNOW IT DID THE TOTAL.

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:58.447
VOLUME OF LANDING DECREASE OUR

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:00.415
FOLKS -- SUBSTITUTING TO OTHER

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:01.249
PRODUCTS OR DO WE HAVE ANY

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:02.217
EVIDENCE TO MOUNT THE

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:03.352
SUBSTITUTING OTHER PRODUCT OKAY

01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:06.588
DO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:09.291
NATURE OF THOSE PRODUCTS WERE.

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.192
PRETTY MUCH -- ONLINE AND

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:12.394
UNREGULATED INTERNET LENDERS GOT

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.429
IT OKAY.

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:17.099
WAS IS THERE A STUDY OF FOR THAT

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:17.733
RESULTS AS THOSE THAT GET IT I

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.502
MEAN THAT THEY WENT TO

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:23.772
UNREGULATED -- LOANS AND

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:24.506
INDUSTRY. FOR THAT.

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:25.574
BUT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF WE HAD

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.541
DATA TO SHOW THAT THE TRANSITION

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.577
FROM SMALL DOLLAR LENDING TO

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:30.545
UNREGULATED.

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:31.680
LENDING TWO WEEKS.

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:33.215
THERE THERE ARE STUDIES FROM

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:34.750
DIFFERENT STATES THAT TALK ABOUT

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:37.119
THE IMPACTS TO CONSUMERS AFTER.

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:39.955
OF RESTRICTIVE RATE CAPS IN.

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:42.624
YOU MAY NOT HAVE -- CURIOSITY TO

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:44.026
DO THIS FOR SOME TIME BUT IT'S

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:45.794
NOT GOOGLE A SMALL DOLLAR LOAN

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:47.496
OR PAYDAY LOAN IN NEW YORK AND

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:48.630
SEE HOW MANY.

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:51.967
LENDERS YOU HAVE COME UP ON YOUR

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:53.201
SEARCH HAD VERY HIGH RATES.

01:17:53.268 --> 01:17:54.469
THEY'RE THERE AND THEY'RE OVER

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:56.304
25% A PR.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:57.572
MEMBERS I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:59.641
IMPORTANT ALSO TO ADD JUST

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.343
QUOTING WHAT WAS JUST SAID AB IT

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.512
WAS DESCRIBED AS PAYDAY LENDING

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:05.781
THIS IS A THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:08.150
PRODUCTS THIS BILL DOES NOT DEAL

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:09.785
WITH PAYDAY LENDING.

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:12.621
THIS IS SMALL DOLLAR LANDING

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:14.556
250-021-0000 PAYDAY LENDING IS

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.191
THREE HUNDRED UNDER SO WE CAN

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:18.894
ACTUALLY COMPARE -- THAT FOR YOU

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.929
KNOW APPLES TO APPLES THERE ARE

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:23.432
MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND SO THIS IS

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:25.300
ONE OF THE PRODUCTS AND THE

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:25.767
THREE HUNDRED UNDER.

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:29.504
IS NOT BEING IMPACTED BY THIS

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:33.075
BILL AND THAT IS PAID A THANK

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:34.176
YOU THINK THINK YOU'RE MUCH OF

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:34.943
JUST BECAUSE SOME MEMBERS I I'M

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:35.544
JUST ASKING QUESTIONS I DON'T

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:36.945
NOW -- YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T SEEN

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:37.879
ANY OF THIS INFORMATION I THINK

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:38.980
IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:40.482
RELEVANT OUR CONVERSATION TO SEE

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:41.983
WHAT THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.985
OF OTHER STATES HAS BEEN -- JUST

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.620
A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORS I I

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.956
AGREE A 100% WITH OUR CHAIR THAT --

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:48.890
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS WE HAVEN'T

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.792
I THINK AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.194
SOME CERTAINTY TO THE MARKET --

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.795
AND TO SHOW YOU KNOW TRYING TO

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:55.430
PROMOTE REGULATORY CERTAINTY SO

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:56.431
FOLKS CAN INVESTORS I'M JUST

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:58.033
CURIOUS -- AS WE'RE THINKING

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.435
ABOUT SETTING THAT NUMBER WHAT.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:03.004
WHAT WAS THE IMPETUS BEHIND 36%

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:05.373
SO THIRTY SIX IS BASED ON THE

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.775
MILITARY LENDING ACT IT'S ON A

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.009
STANDARD A THINK THERE COULD BE

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:09.811
A LOT OF DEBATE ON WHETHER

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.113
THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER OR NOT

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.914
BUT IT CREATED A STANDARD FOR

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:13.815
THE UNITED STATES?

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.517
AND WHAT THE MILITARY LENDING

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.552
ACT DOES IT ALLOWS ACTIVE

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.521
MEMBERS OF OUR MILITARY TO GET A

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.957
LOAN AT 36% IN AN EMERGENCY IN A

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.525
TIME OF NEED AND SO WHAT WE'D

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.826
LIKE TO DO IS EXTEND THAT.

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:27.462
AND IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS 36%

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:28.964
PLUS THE FEDERAL FEE WHICH WILL

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:30.632
CHANGE SLIGHTLY DEPENDING ON THE

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.334
ECONOMY PLUS THE SEVENTY FIVE

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.536
DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.837
AND AS IT'S BEEN NOTED THERE

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.772
COULD BE INSURANCE BUT THAT THE

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.774
LAW IS VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS A

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:41.376
LEGAL FOR LENDER TO MAKE A LOAN

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.078
THAT IS CONTINGENT UPON A BAR

01:19:43.145 --> 01:19:45.046
ACCEPTING ANY KIND OF SEPARATE

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:45.714
PRODUCT.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.449
THERE IS ALREADY A LAW IN PLACE

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:49.084
FOR THAT SO IF PEOPLE ARE

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:51.720
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- WE I

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.455
THINK LAST YEAR I MEAN FIRST THE

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:54.756
LEGISLATURE'S BEEN TRYING TO

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.558
REGULATE THE SPACE FOR FOURTEEN

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.059
YEARS THERE'S A FEW ELEMENTS

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:00.228
THAT HAVE CHANGE FOR OUR STATE

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:01.696
ONE WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA SUPREME

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:03.064
COURT DECISION.

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.766
ON THAT TO US WAS CALLED LAST

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.635
YEAR THAT SAID THAT THESE RATES

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:08.003
ARE UNCONSCIONABLE.

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:09.504
IT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.907
WHERE WE ALSO CAN LOOK EVEN

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:12.741
RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT THAT

01:20:12.807 --> 01:20:13.408
WHEN.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:16.011
THE LEGISLATURE FAILS TO ACT THE

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:17.345
G. JUST SYSTEM WILL STEP IN AND

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:19.781
WILL CREATE A LOAN FROM TALKING

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:22.284
TO AVERAGE FOLKS -- ON ANY SIDE

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.786
OF THE AISLE 36% STILL SOUNDS

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.721
HIGH TO SOME FOLKS -- AND SO

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.056
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT YOUR

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:34.829
AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL WILL THINK

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:35.397
818228% IS SOMETHING MORE IN

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:35.597
LINE.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:36.398
BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT IS STILL

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:39.234
IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME OPTION

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:40.869
TO PEOPLE IN AN EMERGENCY CRISIS

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:42.404
WE CAME UP WITH THIS NEGOTIATED

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.739
PRODUCT WHAT YOU SAW LAST YEAR

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.875
WAS A BILL THAT WAS SIMILAR BUT

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:47.676
NOT IDENTICAL.

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.811
I'M AND FOR US YOU KNOW ONE OF

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.446
THE VERY FIRST THINGS I DID WHEN

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.415
I CAME INTO THIS ROLE AND AND

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.450
LOOKED AT THE SPACES ASKED -- AS

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.185
THEY THINK WAS WAS ASKED BY

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:58.286
DOCTOR CHOI AND THERE WAS NO

01:20:58.353 --> 01:20:59.888
ANSWER GIVEN WHICH WAS WHAT

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.189
WOULD BE THE MAGIC PERCENTAGE.

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:03.291
AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT NO ONE HAD

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:06.061
A MAGIC PERCENTAGE AND THEREFORE

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:07.829
THESE HIGH INTEREST -- TO THAT

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.331
WOULD BE PERPETUATED OUR

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.566
CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:13.835
REALLY AROUND THE COUNTRY FEEL

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.704
THAT THESE ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE --

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.539
WE HAVE USURY LAWS IN THIS

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.608
COUNTRY FOR A REASON -- WE DON'T

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:20.809
LIKE IT WHEN CREDIT CARDS ARE

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:23.478
OVER EIGHTEEN OR 28% WELL THIS

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.247
IS A PRODUCT THAT AGAIN.

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.249
I HAVE PEOPLE INCLUDING CONSUMER

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:29.351
GROUPS WHO WOULD LIKE US TO PUSH

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.553
MORE AND TO GO FURTHER WHO THINK

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.321
36% PLUS THE FEDERAL FEE IS TOO

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.189
HIGH.

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:35.523
AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE MEMBERS

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:38.159
OF INDUSTRY THAT THINK 36% IS

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.628
NEVER GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO GET

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:40.428
THEM THERE.

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:41.830
THIS IS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:44.699
DOES WE TRIED TO FIND A PLACE

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.001
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:48.270
SIDES WHO FEEL THIS IS NOT THE

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.971
IDEAL AN IDENTICAL PLACE BUT

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:51.906
THIS IS WHERE WE'VE LANDED AFTER

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.108
MONTHS.

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:54.876
OF CONVERSATIONS MONTHS OF

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:56.378
CONVERSATION SIXTEEN MONTHS

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:57.712
SINCE JANUARY SINCE I BECAME THE

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:59.681
OFFICIAL CHAIR OF CONVERSATIONS

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:03.018
WITH ALL FOLKS ABOUT THIS -- AND

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:04.719
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT VERY

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:06.254
GREAT THAT WE CAN'T YOU KNOW IT

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.255
DOESN'T FEEL GREAT THAT ALL

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:08.723
SIDES CAN'T COME TO THIS BUT

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:09.958
THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE'VE

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:11.526
LANDED AFTER A LOT OF

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:12.861
CONVERSATIONS -- AND CERES

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.596
COMPROMISE AND NEGOTIATION AND

01:22:14.663 --> 01:22:19.534
WE THINK THAT THIS IS WHERE OUR

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:20.902
STATE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:21.202
[inaudible]

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.571
WHETHER.

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:24.606
NOW I WANT -- TO THANK THE

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:25.607
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.242
I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A QUITE A

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:28.209
JOURNEY IN IT I THINK I MAY HAVE.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:30.045
BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE LONGER

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:33.181
THAN ANYONE -- IS THAT THE LAST

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:33.481
SIX YEARS.

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:36.284
AND IS MY SEVENTH YEAR ON THIS

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:37.052
COMMITTEE.

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.653
WE HAVE WRESTLED WITH THIS ISSUE

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.088
FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I HAVE BEEN

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:41.489
ON THIS COMMITTEE.

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.625
IT IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE AND

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:45.627
ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOW THE WE'RE

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:47.262
DEALING WITH -- COMMUNITIES OF

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:52.667
CHALLENGE OF WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY.

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.035
LIVES IN MOVING FORWARD.

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.804
AND THAT HAVE SOMETIMES ENTERED

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.572
INTO THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.541
VARIOUS COMPANIES AND THE

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:00.742
UNFORTUNATE THING IS MOST OF THE

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:02.143
TIME WHEN WHEN I GOT WHEN I

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:03.278
FIRST GOT ON COMMITTEE WE HAD A

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.046
LOT OF HEARINGS WE HAD PEOPLE

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:06.414
WHO CAME AND TOLD THEIR STORIES.

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:07.449
AND MOST OF THE TIME THERE WERE

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:09.484
STORIES OF HORROR I MEAN THEY

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:10.719
WERE REALLY PEOPLE WHO HAD.

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:12.821
WHO HAD NEEDS BUT AS A RESULT OF

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.856
ENGAGING IN THESE KIND OF CREDIT

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:16.191
THE -- ONCE A PREDATORY THESE

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:18.159
LENDING COMPANIES ARE ENDED UP

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.928
EVEN IN WORSE CONDITION BECAUSE

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:22.197
OF YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:22.564
THAT THEY WERE.

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.499
INVESTING INTO WHETHER IT WAS

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:26.167
THE THIS PARTICULAR LOAN AWARE

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:27.769
THERE WAS A CAR LOANS OR

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:31.306
WHATEVER WE WE DID WALL WITH THE

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.074
WAS A PAYDAY.

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:33.708
ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND AND IN

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.710
EACH CASE MOST OF THE TIME THEY

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:36.511
ENDED UP IN WORSE PLACES THAT

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:37.412
MADE THEM WHAT WE WOULD LIKE FOR

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:38.947
THEM TO BE.

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:39.581
AND AND I IN A YOU KNOW IT AND

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.483
THE FIRST I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.184
WERE TALKING ABOUT UNTIL I BEGAN

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.820
TO REALLY EXAMINE -- WHERE WE

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:48.123
ALL ARE AS A STATE IN THIS IN

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.624
THIS PARTICULAR SPACE?

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.459
AND RECOGNIZE THAT ALMOST ALL OF

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:53.895
THESE PLACES ARE LOCATED IN A

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:55.797
VERY POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.565
BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT ALMOST

01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:58.566
EVERY TIME I LOOKED UP IN THE

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.235
COMMUNITY THAT I LIVE AND WORK

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:00.735
IN.

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:02.404
THERE WAS A A PLACE POPPING UP

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.438
THAT WAS DOING THESE KINDS OF

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.607
LOANS OR WHETHER WAS PAYDAY

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:07.041
LOANS CAR LOANS WHATEVER IT WAS.

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:08.810
AND UP AND AND PEOPLE WERE

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:09.878
SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF THAT

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:11.413
AND AND I THINK WHAT ALSO

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:12.080
HAPPENED WAS.

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:14.149
I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT AS LONG

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:16.151
AS WE ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.786
IT SETS THE BEHAVIOR A WITH

01:24:17.852 --> 01:24:19.788
REGARDS TO HOW WE LOOK AT ALL

01:24:19.854 --> 01:24:21.423
LENDING HOW WE LOOK AT

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:23.625
MANAGEMENT OF OUR RESOURCES AND

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:24.192
NOT THAT THESE FOLKS HAVE A

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:25.393
WEALTH.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.529
BUT THE FACT THAT -- YOU KNOW I

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:29.097
COME FROM A FAMILY OF OF OF

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:30.432
CHALLENGE.

01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:31.866
IN YET OUR BECAUSE THESE WERE

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.401
AVAILABLE IN THOSE DAYS PEOPLE

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:35.670
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.539
BUT LONG AS WE HAVE PAID A LOANS

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:39.140
OR WHATEVER THEY MAY BE.

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:40.875
PEOPLE GO EVERY OTHER MONTH

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:43.144
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO FILL IN

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:44.078
THE GAP AND EVENTUALLY YOU GET

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:44.679
CAUGHT.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.448
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING TOO FAR

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:47.282
AWAY FROM WHERE YOU WERE ONCE

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:47.949
WORK.

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:50.351
AND NOW YOU ARE OVERWHELMED BY

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:51.619
THE VARIOUS KINDS OF PRODUCTS

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:53.488
THAT YOU ENGAGED IN.

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:55.056
AND AND IT JUST BRINGS

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.157
TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY IN PEOPLE'S

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:57.759
LIVES WE'VE SEEN IT OVER AND

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.594
OVER AGAIN SO I I KNOW THIS IS

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:01.429
NOT THE MOST OF THIS IS A

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:02.764
COMFORTABLE PLACE TO BE.

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:07.802
BUT I THINK -- WHEN I THINK OF

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:09.838
CALIFORNIA I ALWAYS THINK OF

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:10.572
THIS PLACE OF?

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:11.773
HOPE OF BEING PROGRESSIVE BEING

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.374
MORE CONCERNED ABOUT INDIVIDUALS

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:14.776
YOU KNOW HAVING A SOCIAL SERVICE

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:17.045
PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO KIND OF

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:17.545
BILL FAMILIES AND BILL

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:18.713
INDIVIDUALS.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.115
AND YET WE HAVE BECOME FAR AWAY

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:22.717
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I HAD AS A

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:25.553
KID AND COMING TO THE STATE THAT

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.488
WE'RE NOW IN IN THAT IN ONE OF

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:27.622
THOSE SPACES THAT I DON'T LIKE

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:28.523
BEING IN.

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:29.691
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS LIST OF

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:31.826
THOSE IN AND AND THE PERCENTAGES

01:25:31.893 --> 01:25:32.994
I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:33.962
CALIFORNIA IS HANGING DOWN TO

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:35.196
THE BOTTOM WITH VERY LITTLE

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:37.098
REGULATION OR NO REGULATION IN

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.234
SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS?

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.935
AND WE'RE AND WE'RE FINDING THAT

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:43.371
PEOPLE ARE POOR THAN BEFORE.

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:44.272
AND WOULD SOMEHOW KNOW THE

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:46.040
DIGGING EVEN DEEPER HOLES OF

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:47.141
POVERTY -- THE FEDERAL

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:49.477
GOVERNMENT HAS THE THE 36% I

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:51.846
MEAN AND AND WE SEE THAT THAT'S

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:53.014
AND AND IS THERE MAINLY BECAUSE

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:54.883
MOST OF OUR MILITARY FAMILIES

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:55.884
WERE WORDS CONSTANTLY GOING IN

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.452
GETTING LOANS AND AND THEY

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:57.752
DISCOVERED.

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.254
THAT IT WAS HAVING AN ADVERSE

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.589
EFFECT ON OUR MILITARY -- WHO

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.191
PEOPLE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:04.158
AND SO THEY THEN STEPPED IN AND

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:05.960
SAID OKAY WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:07.629
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE?

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:09.697
YOU KNOW THE KIND OF ACTIVITY

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:10.265
OCCURRING WAS JUST REALLY

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.000
DESTROYING THE MORALE OF THE

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:13.902
INDIVIDUALS IT WAS A STRONG A

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:15.637
FINANCES THEIR STABILITY THE

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.605
CURE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND GOES

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:19.107
ON AND ON UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT

01:26:19.173 --> 01:26:20.975
STEPPED IN AND SAID OKAY THIS IS

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:23.144
NOT HAPPENING MORE. FOR THE

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:25.847
MILITARY -- IN AT SOME POINT WE

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:31.920
HAVE TO SAY THE SAME THING --

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:35.023
36% IS A LOT.

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:37.091
IT REALLY IS A LIVE IN THOSE OF

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:38.359
US WHO VALUE OUR OUR ECONOMICS

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:41.062
NO THAT'S A THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:43.197
FOR LOANS YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:44.532
LOOK AT OUR CREDIT CARD AMOUNTS

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:45.500
AND FOLKS OF STARTING

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:46.701
ELIMINATING CREDIT CARDS IN

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:48.102
THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THE

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:50.371
PERCENTAGES SO HIGH -- WE HAD TO

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:51.973
TELL PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT YOU BE

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.942
BORROWED MONEY WITH THIS CREDIT

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:54.542
CARD THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:55.209
COST YOU.

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:57.612
AND IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST OF US

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:59.047
WHO JUST LIKE I'M YOU MORE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.448
CREDIT CARDS I NEED TO LIMIT

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:01.716
THAT BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE IT'S

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.585
WHEN YOU REALIZE WHAT IT IS AND

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:04.719
WE WERE IN A CREDIT CARD

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:05.920
GENERATION.

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:07.322
WE HAD ALL OF US HAD JUST HUGE

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:08.856
NUMBERS OF CREDIT CARD EVERY

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:09.958
STORE EVERYWHERE YOU GO YOU HAVE

01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:11.025
A CREDIT CARD BUT YOU BEGIN TO

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:13.962
REALIZE THIS EIGHTEEN OF 28% OF

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:14.829
WHATEVER IT WAS.

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.798
AND YOU PAYING MINIMAL TO DO IT

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:18.466
YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT OF DEBT YOU

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:19.867
KNOW YOU BY ADDRESS IT IS GOING

01:27:19.934 --> 01:27:21.903
TO CST YOU OF THE DRESS IS

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:24.372
ALREADY IN PHONE AWAY AND YOU

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:26.274
STILL CAN'T.

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:28.009
FOR AND SO -- SO WE WE WE'VE

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:28.576
BEGUN TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:30.812
INFORMATION WE DISCOVER WE BEGIN

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:31.980
THIS IDEA BEGIN TO CHANGE MY

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:33.815
BEHAVIOR WITH THE USE OF THIS

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.216
MAINLY BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:36.384
PEOPLE WILL SOMETIMES A JUSTIN

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:37.018
CHANGE IF THEY HAVE.

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:38.119
TO AND AS I LOOK AT THIS I

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:39.153
REALIZE IT IS GOING TO BE

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:39.721
DIFFICULT IS GOING TO BE A

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:40.021
CHALLENGE.

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.589
BUT IF WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:42.156
TO HELP PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:43.091
BEHAVIOR WE TALK ALL THE TIME

01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:44.125
ABOUT POVERTY IN THE STATE.

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.526
AND HOW WE OF CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:46.761
THIS HUGE GAP OF POVERTY AND IT

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.396
DOESN'T COME EASY FOR PEOPLE TO

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:49.063
CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR SO THIS IS

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.632
TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:51.466
THINGS THAT WE HAVE.

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:52.867
TO KIND OF FINALLY BITE THE

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.002
BULLET ON YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:55.269
I'VE BEEN IT IF SOME OF YOU BEEN

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:56.270
HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS SEVEN

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:56.938
YEARS LISTENING TO THIS.

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:58.706
AND GRAPPLING WITH THAT IN

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.141
TRYING TO ASK MYSELF AM I DOING

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.209
MORE HARM TO PEOPLE POOR BECAUSE

01:28:01.275 --> 01:28:02.010
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

01:28:02.076 --> 01:28:04.979
CAPITAL THEY DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY

01:28:05.046 --> 01:28:06.147
YOU KNOW THEY'LL HAVE FAMILIES

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:07.548
THAT THE LOAN THE MONEY IF ON

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:08.983
AND ON AND ON AND AND THEN I

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.851
CAME TO THE REALIZATION.

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:11.853
THAT I COME FROM A FAMILY THAT

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:12.453
DIDN'T HAVE MONEY THAT PEOPLE

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:12.787
COULD LONGER.

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:13.388
AT AND AS A RESULT OF THAT MY

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:14.455
FAMILY HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:16.424
THEY WATCH CAREFULLY WHAT WE DID

01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:17.558
INVEST IN THINGS THAT WITH THEIR

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:19.360
AND WE NEVER HAD A HUGE SAVINGS

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:20.028
ACCOUNT OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.696
BUT WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:22.964
DIDN'T DIG A HOLE FOR OURSELVES

01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:24.499
THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN

01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:26.067
THAT WE WERE ALREADY POOR BUT WE

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:37.278
DON'T WANT YOU POINT AND WHAT WE

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:37.478
WORK.

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:40.281
SO I YOU KNOW I SAID WITH THIS I

01:28:40.348 --> 01:28:42.850
KNOW THAT YOU WRESTLE WITH THIS

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.519
FOR THAT WHEN YOU BECAME CHAIR

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:46.587

DO YOU KNOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:55.196
THIS LEADS US AND BUT I'VE BEEN

01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:56.597
IMPRESSED THAT AT LEAST THEY

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:57.999
FOUND A STANDARD THAT THAT THAT

01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:58.566
THAT IS WORK FOR THE FEDERAL

01:28:58.633 --> 01:28:59.300
GOVERNMENT.

DIDN'T PREPARE THAT CHART AND

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:29.731
WHAT'S ON THAT CHART IS JUST THE

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:31.099
INTEREST RATE CAP IT DOESN'T

01:29:31.165 --> 01:29:32.400

PRETTY COMPLICATED AND THAT'S

01:29:39.707 --> 01:29:41.042

PERMISSIBLE FEES AND CHARGES

LEVEL THAT WE CAN HAVE A VIABLE

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.198

MR GOVERNOR HAD ANY THING HE

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:39.867
WANTED TO ADD IN TERMS OF THE

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:42.069
COMPANIES THE LENDERS YOU

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:43.938
REPRESENT AND ADDING TO THIS --

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:45.206
ONLY IN SO MUCH AS OBVIOUS OF

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.841
THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN AROUND

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:48.609
QUITE SOME TIME.

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:50.778
THEY DO -- ISSUE LOANS AT THIRTY

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:51.646
SIX AND BELOW THESE ARE SELF

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:52.947
IMPOSED CAPS GENERALLY.

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:54.649
AND TO THE EXTENT SOME OF THESE

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:56.017
COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO PULL

01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:57.251
PEOPLE OUT OF THE HIGHER

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:58.252
INTEREST LOANS.

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:00.154
THOSE BORROWERS ACTUALLY WOULD

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:01.589
HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE LOANS IN

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.558
THE FIRST PLACE SO THE NOTION

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.459
THAT THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:06.928
IS GOING TO DRY UP.

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:08.129
IS ACTUALLY INCORRECT TO THE

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:09.664
EXTENT THERE ARE CONSUMERS IN

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:12.333

LOANS PERSONALLY REFERENCE

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.671
EARLIER SO THAT PART OF THE

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:18.206
MARKET THOSE CONSUMERS WOULD

01:31:18.272 --> 01:31:23.311
STILL HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:26.047

THIS IS THE MOST AWKWARD

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.184
COMMITTEE ROOM TO TESTIFY IN

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.652
ISN'T IT BECAUSE INEVITABLY

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:33.020
SOMEBODY BEHIND YOU WANTS TO

01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:34.288
TALK TO YOU.

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:35.857

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.076
WHAT THE DEFAULT RATE IS ON

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:56.577
THESE TYPES OF LOANS THAT WERE

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:59.447

THE TWO COMPANIES I REPRESENT.

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:11.425
IS 20% WHICH MEANS 80% OF PEOPLE

01:32:11.492 --> 01:32:13.494
ARE RIPPING THOSE LOANS.

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:16.163
OKAY. 20% DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING

01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:17.064

YES SOME REMEMBER BLIND AS I

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:21.435
PULLED UP AT TEN K. FROM A LARGE

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:22.470
ONLINE WONDER.

01:32:22.536 --> 01:32:24.639
THAT REPORTS A 52% CHARGE OFF

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:25.373
RATE.

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:28.142
OKAY SO THAT'S ONLINE LENDERS

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:30.011

THERE'S SOME VARIATION YOU'RE

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.316
SAYING 20% YOU'RE SAYING SOME AT

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.952
52% AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING AS

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:41.322
WELL YES -- AND I THINK.

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:42.924
THE HOME JUST KEEP IT BRIEF

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.224
[inaudible]

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:44.091
PEOPLE CONFUSE.

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:46.560
DEFAULT CHARTER FREIGHT LOAN

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:48.663
LOSSES -- PERHAPS WHAT MR

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:50.631
GOVERNOR'S LOOKING AT IS OUR GAP

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.934
ACCOUNTING PUBLIC RECORDS THAT

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.136
SHOW KIND OF THE CHARGE OFF

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:58.406
RATES -- OURS ARE LOAN LOSSES IN

01:32:58.472 --> 01:33:01.475
OUR PUBLIC FILINGS FOR TWO

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:03.311
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WERE 40% --

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:07.248
ONE MAIN WAS 25% THAT'S AN

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:07.882
APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON FOR

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:08.082
YOU.

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.716
THAT REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:10.084
IN THE TYPES OF CONSUMERS THAT

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:11.852
WE SERVE OKAY SO WE HAVE A

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:14.021
VARIETY THEN I WOULD SAY OF A

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:17.224
DEFAULT RATES THAT'S FINE -- SO

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:18.592
THEN.

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:23.631
TOO I GUESS TO THE AUTHORS --

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:26.300
WHERE WHERE ARE THE CONSUMERS IF

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:29.537
THEY CAN'T GET THIS TYPE OF LOAN?

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:31.405
WHERE WILL THEY GO?

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:33.507
SO THEY THERE ARE STILL OTHER

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:36.277
PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET AND THIS

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:38.412
LOAN LIKE WILL LIKE WHAT PAYDAY.

IS STILL IN THE MARKET THE PILOT

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:41.882
PROGRAM STILL IN THE MARKET AND

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:44.518
THIS LOAN THE 250-021-0000 IS

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:45.686
STILL IN THE MARKET AT A

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:46.854
DIFFERENT RATE.

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.255
THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY EXCEPT

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:51.559
OKAY EXCEPT IT'S NOT -- I GUESS

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:52.893
IF YOU TAKE.

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.862
IF YOU HAVE AB AND C. COMPANIES

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:55.963
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.398
THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT AND YOU

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.066
TAKE AWAY BE IN SEEING A LAMP A

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.635
LOT THEN THERE'S PROBABLY LESS

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:02.870
TO GO AROUND AND THAT WAS BEFORE

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:03.104
RIGHT.

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:04.372
ATTY JUST OR COULD BE LESS

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:06.207
ALTHOUGH I CAN TELL YOU THAT

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:07.641
FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS.

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:09.076
YOU KNOW WITH OTHER FOLKS IN THE

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.911
COUNTRY THEY WANT REGULATORY

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:13.914
STABILITY AND THERE MAY BE OTHER

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:15.282
FOLKS TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:20.321
ONCE THEY KNOW WHAT THE MARKET'S

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:20.821
GOING TO BE.

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:22.390
I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT BUT FROM

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:24.825
CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD OKAY SO

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:25.126
[inaudible]

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:27.728
I'M [inaudible]

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:31.165
HERE'S I'M OUT WITH THIS NUMBER

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:33.968
ONE WE HAVE HAD -- A LOT OF

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:37.104
DISCUSSION ABOUT.

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:39.774
THAT THIS IS PREDATORY TYPE OF

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.275
LENDING AND THAT IT'S IT'S SO

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:44.478
EXPENSIVE TO CONSUMERS.

01:34:44.545 --> 01:34:46.147
AND THERE IS A REASON WHY.

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:48.049
EVEN THOUGH IT MAY M

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:49.517
EXPENSIVE TO US THEN WHY WOULD

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:51.585
ANYONE GO IN SEARCH OF THIS TYPE

01:34:51.652 --> 01:34:54.255
OF LOAN PEOPLE STILL DO IT.

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:56.190
RIGHT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:58.292
OTHER OPTIONS.

01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:59.393
LIKE THE ONES THAT YOU YOU KNOW

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:02.329
SUGGESTED THEY'RE STILL DOING IT.

01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:04.231
SO ALL RIGHT SO THERE'S A NEED

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:04.865
OUT THERE WHETHER WE AGREE WITH

01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:06.400
THAT OR NOT.

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:09.170
BUT CALIFORNIA IS NUMBER ONE IN

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:10.337
POVERTY.

01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:11.572
THERE'S A REASON PEOPLE NEED

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:13.074
THESE TYPES OF ONCE AND IT IS

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.942
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

01:35:15.009 --> 01:35:16.377
DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER IF THE

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:17.578
POLICIES PUT IN PLACE IN

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:18.946
CALIFORNIA DID MAKE IT SO

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:19.914
EXPENSIVE.

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.048
PEOPLE WOULD NEED THESE TYPES OF

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:22.516
LOANS THE AVERAGE RENT OF A

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:25.319
STUDIO APARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:27.721
SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:28.889
SO IT'S I THINK IT'S

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:30.691
DISINGENUOUS TO MAKE THE

01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:32.059
VILLAINS OUT TO BE THE PEOPLE

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:34.862
THE WHO ARE PROVIDING THE LOANS.

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:36.230
THAT PEOPLE ARE SEEKING BECAUSE

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:37.565
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN

01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:39.166
CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T DISAGREE

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:42.403
WITH YOU THAT -- PEOPLE GET INTO

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:44.605
THESE TYPES OF LOANS AND MAYBE

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:46.474
DON'T REALIZE EXACTLY WHAT

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.842
THEY'RE GETTING INTO I THINK A

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:49.977
LOT OF PEOPLE DO THOUGH -- I'VE

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:52.179
HAD MEMBERS OF MY OWN FAMILY WHO

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:54.682
ABUSED THESE TYPES OF LOAN

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:56.484
PRODUCTS IN A PAY THEM OFF.

01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:57.885
NO IN IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY

01:35:57.952 --> 01:35:58.953
DIDN'T DON'T WANT TO END UP.

01:35:59.019 --> 01:36:00.621
YOU KNOW SPENDING FORTY TWO

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:02.656
THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A FIVE

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:03.357
THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN SOME PEOPLE

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:04.058
DO.

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:05.960
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO INJECT INTO

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:07.328
THIS CONVERSATION PERSONAL

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:09.096
ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERSONAL

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:10.464
RESPONSIBILITY IN KNOWING WHAT

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:11.398
YOU'RE SIGNING UP FOR IN

01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:12.933
AGREEING TO THAT.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.002
AND AS DOCTOR WEBER SUGGESTED

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:16.670
YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME IN OUR

01:36:16.737 --> 01:36:17.972
LIVES WHERE.

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:19.440
IF YOU COULDN'T AFFORD SOMETHING

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:21.775
YOU DIDN'T BUY IT.

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:22.843
I MEAN.

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:26.113
YEAH BUT WE WE CAN'T LEGISLATE

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.916
HOW -- BEHAVE I THINK WE'RE

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:34.688
BEYOND THAT POINT SO I I SEE A I

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:35.589
SEE A NUMBER I SEE THE

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:36.857
CALIFORNIA BUT CHAMBER OF

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.459
COMMERCE A CALIFORNIA HISPANIC

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:39.393
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE ORANGE

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.394
COUNTY HISPANIC.

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:42.930
I SEE A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:44.031
HERE THAT REPRESENT BLACK AND

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:45.032
BROWN COMMUNITIES THEY'RE

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.400
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL LIKELY

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:48.802
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THEY

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:50.337
REPRESENT.

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:52.540
WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS FOR

01:36:52.606 --> 01:36:54.275
RED GREEN WITH THAT OR NOT AND

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:56.844
THAT GIVES ME PAUSE -- SO I

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:58.913
GUESS I WILL IN MY COMMENTS WITH

01:36:58.979 --> 01:36:59.747
THAT.

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:00.981
AND I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD

01:37:01.048 --> 01:37:02.383
WITH SAYING THAT WHILE THERE'S

01:37:02.449 --> 01:37:04.251
ALSO A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:05.819
FAITH BASED GROUPS VETERANS

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:07.821
GROUPS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:09.323
REPRESENT UNDER REPRESENTED --

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:10.624
COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THAT

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:12.626
ARE ALSO IN FAVOR OF THE BILL SO

01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:13.561
I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:16.130
NOTED -- AS WELL AND I YOU KNOW

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:17.231
I APPRECIATE YOUR COMING ABOUT

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:19.333
POVERTY BECAUSE I ALSO THINK

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.269
THAT -- THIS CANNOT.

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:23.871
THIS PRODUCT CANNOT MASK ARE

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.773
NEED AS THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:27.675
ADDRESS POVERTY AND THIS WILL

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:29.310
NOT GET US OUT OF POVERTY BY

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:31.111
OFFERING THIS PRODUCT AND AND I

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.379
THINK THAT THAT IS A BIGGER

01:37:32.446 --> 01:37:34.648
CONVERSATION -- AND CERTAINLY

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:35.950
ONE THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:36.984
COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIGURE

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:39.486
OUT WHAT WE DO AS A STATE -- BUT

01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:41.388
THIS REALLY CANNOT SERVE AS A

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.257
MASS FOR AT THE GREATER ISSUE

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:44.558
AND THE UNDERLYING ISSUE WHICH

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:46.627
IS WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:49.496
POVERTY AND THERE IS.

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:52.533
I THINK MERIT TO WHETHER OR NOT --

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.102
THIS MAKES IT THE OPTION WORSE

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:57.571
OR BETTER AND WE YOU KNOW THE

01:37:57.638 --> 01:37:58.739
BECAUSE THE PRODUCT IS STILL

01:37:58.806 --> 01:38:00.207
GONNA EXIST BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:01.542
STILL MULTIPLE PRODUCTS ON THE

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:02.376
MARKET.

01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:03.477
AND WE'VE COME TO THE POINT

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:05.012
WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:07.481
ACTUALLY MOVING US IN A BETTER

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:11.085
DIRECTION.

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:11.952
THANK YOU SIR.

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:12.853
THE CONCERN WITH THE WAY THAT

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.421
THAT LOANS HAVE BEEN STRUCTURED

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:16.190
THE STATE OVER A LONG TIME THAT

01:38:16.257 --> 01:38:17.791
THE NATURE OF THE PREDATORY

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.860
ASPECTS OF THEM IS TWO FOLD AND

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:21.061
ONE IS A NEWS IN.

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:23.631
JUST A STUNNINGLY HIGH.

01:38:23.697 --> 01:38:26.000
INTEREST RATES THAT HOLD PEOPLE

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:29.169
INTO THE CYCLES OF DAD OVER AND

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:30.537
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:38:30.604 --> 01:38:32.673
AND THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:35.409
PREDATORY NATURE IS THE WAY THAT

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.111
THEY'RE ADVERTISED AND I WOULD

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:39.079
HOPE IT PEOPLE WOULD TAKE A LOOK

01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:41.282
AT THE NUMBERS THAT THAT GET

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:43.317
PRESENTED AND IF YOU -- TWO

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:44.785
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT'S THE

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:45.352
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU'RE

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.820
TAKING OUT.

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:49.723
AND YOU END UP PAYING BACK.

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:51.659
THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PLUS

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:53.360
TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:54.361
IN INTEREST.

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:55.829
THAT SHOULD WAKE SOME FOLKS UP

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:57.798
UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T BECAUSE

01:38:57.865 --> 01:38:59.833
THERE THEY FEEL THAT THAT THESE

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.101
ARE THE ONLY OPTIONS THAT HAVE

01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:02.636
BEEN PRESENTED TO THEM AND THAT

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:04.938
ARE AVAILABLE I THINK IF WE CAN.

01:39:05.005 --> 01:39:06.674
BE AS SMART HERE AND PUT A

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:09.476
LEGITIMATE CAP AND LOOK AT IT

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:11.845
TAKE OFF THE TABLE LOANS THAT

01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:13.947
ARE GUARANTEED TO PERPETUATE

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:15.382
POVERTY.

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:16.517
AND THEN THROUGH STRUCTURES LIKE

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:18.552
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:20.654
REALLY WORKING HARD ON ENSURING

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.956
THAT WE HAVE FINANCIAL LITERACY

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:24.892
AND AT A MORE APPROPRIATE

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:29.029
PRODUCTS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:30.331
36% IS PRETTY HIGH.

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:31.899
AND THEN IT SEEMS A LITTLE HARD

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:33.000
TO BE SUPPORTING SOMETHING AT

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.768
THAT LEVEL.

01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:36.303
AT LEAST LOOKING WHAT THE

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:37.571
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO DO

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:38.472
WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY FOLKS

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:40.474
IN AND THEY THEY SAID THE 36%

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:41.775
THAT BECAUSE THEY SAY YOU'RE NOT

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:43.110
GONNA CHARGE.

01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:44.678
OUR PEOPLE PEOPLE IN THE

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:47.114
MILITARY BEYOND 36% BECAUSE

01:39:47.181 --> 01:39:48.882
THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE THAT'S THE

01:39:48.949 --> 01:39:50.684
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.820
STANCE ON THIS AND NOW WE HAVE

01:39:52.886 --> 01:39:54.154
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:55.489
OURSELVES WITH OTHER STATES

01:39:55.556 --> 01:39:57.591
ENCOURAGE OTHER PROD PRODUCTS

01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:59.626
AND YES THERE MAY BE SOME.

01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:01.662
COMPANIES WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO

01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:02.696
MAKE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.498

ENSURING THAT WE ARE HELPING TO

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.509
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:16.944
NOT PERPETUATING.

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:37.731
FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT THEY

01:40:37.798 --> 01:40:39.166
WERE.

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:40.734

COMPLETELY AWAY WHICH MAKES IT

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:54.081
EVEN MORE CRITICAL.

NUMBER THE ULTIMATELY IS THERE'S

01:41:30.417 --> 01:41:33.120
NO FORMULA. TO IT I HEARD THE

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:36.156
CLOSEST THING WAS 3% TIMES --

GATHERED AT IS THERE A NUMBER IN

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:47.601
WHICH THERE'S POSSIBLE THAT IS

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:49.403
AGREEABLE TO THE OPPOSITION THEY

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:50.938
CAN WORK WITH TO HAVE THEIR

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:52.473
FINANCIAL BUSINESS MODEL.

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:54.908
WORK FOR THEM WHILE AT THE SAME

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:59.713
TIME CERTAINLY THE CLIENT -- SO

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.014

IF I MAY OF FOR SO JUST POINT

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:05.686
OUT THAT THE MILITARY LENDING

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.921
ACT WAS ACTUALLY PASSED UNDER A

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.590
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT.

01:42:09.656 --> 01:42:12.626
AND THIS IS THIS IS AND SHOULD

01:42:12.693 --> 01:42:14.495
BE A BIPARTISAN ISSUE ABOUT

01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:16.096
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:17.998
I THINK YOU'VE -- AND AND HAVE

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:20.567
HEARD -- BY A MULTIPLE FOLKS AND

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:21.935
IN TESTIMONY.

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:23.504
THAT -- THERE WAS NO MAGIC

01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:25.439
NUMBER THERE WASN'T ANYTHING

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:27.140
THAT WE COULD DO TO TRY TO FIND

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:29.843
THAT THAT SWEET SPOT OTHER THAN.

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.012
CONSIDER WHAT WAS ALREADY

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:32.813
WORKING.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.381
AND WE DON'T KNOW OF ANOTHER

01:42:34.448 --> 01:42:36.717
NUMBER WILL WORK BUT WHAT WE DO

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:40.120
KNOW IS THAT 36% DOES WORK.

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:41.755
IT WORKS FOR OUR MILITARY AND SO

01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:44.224
WITH THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:46.560
PRIMARY MAIN REASONS WHY WE

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.061
CHOSE.

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:49.596
TO FOLLOW SUIT OF SOMETHING THAT

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:51.498
ALREADY WORKS KNOWING THAT WHAT

01:42:51.565 --> 01:42:55.869
WE CURRENTLY HAVE ISN'T WORKING.

01:42:55.936 --> 01:42:56.570
THANK YOU.

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:57.905
THE ACTUALLY OF I'VE HAD SOME

01:42:57.971 --> 01:42:59.740
CONSTITUENTS CONTACT ME -- TO MY

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:01.275
DISTRICT OFFICE OF YOUR PHONE

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.410
ALSO VIA MAIL THAT THEY'RE

01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:03.977
CLAIMING AND THEY'RE STATING

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:05.245
THAT.

01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:06.580
ONCE THIS.

01:43:06.647 --> 01:43:08.916
GOES AWAY THIS ONE POINT THREE

01:43:08.982 --> 01:43:10.350
BILLION ACCESS TO CAPITAL --

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:11.485
THAT THERE ARE NO LONGER HAVING

01:43:11.552 --> 01:43:13.921
THE ABILITY. TO FUNCTION AS A

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:15.622
BUSINESSMAN IS IT YOUR INTENT

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.157
THAT THE NEW BUSINESS MODEL WILL

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:19.326
BE CREATED AND THAT NUMBER TWO

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:21.428
IS TO CURB BEHAVIOR TO DO

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:25.032
NEEDLESS SPENDING AND LOAN DEBTS.

01:43:25.098 --> 01:43:27.334
SO I THINK THAT THE SO.

01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:28.001
A THING MISTER GOVERNOR ACTUALLY

01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:30.637
MENTIONED THAT THE ONE POINT --

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:33.307
THREE THAT MAY NOT BE SERVED BY

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:35.509
THE HIGH INTEREST LENDERS A BUT

01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:36.944
IT COULD STILL BE SERVED BY

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.378
OTHERS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:40.514
REALITIES -- AND I THINK THE

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:42.916
INTENT IS.

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:44.318
TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:46.086
PERPETUATE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:49.022
MODEL ON THAT ALSO SERVES AS THE

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:50.958
CONSUMERS BUT STILL KEEPS THE

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:52.926
PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:53.961
THANK YOU MANAGER OF MY LAST

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.262
QUESTIONS TO THE OPPOSITION.

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:57.331
AND YOU I GUESS MY ULTRA

01:43:57.397 --> 01:43:59.199
QUESTIONS TO DR PAUL IF YOU WILL

01:43:59.266 --> 01:44:00.901
WHY IS IT THAT WE HAVE LENDERS

01:44:00.968 --> 01:44:02.669
THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY.

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.171
AS I UNDERSTAND FROM THEM THIS

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:06.540
HAVE -- IT WILL TO SERVE A VITAL

01:44:06.607 --> 01:44:08.942
SCORE SIX HUNDRED BELOW -- WHILE

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:10.844
AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:11.945
BUSINESS WISE OF THE YOUR

01:44:12.012 --> 01:44:17.651
BUSINESS ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:20.387
IT IT REALLY IS ABOUT RISK.

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:21.321
AND INTEREST RATE.

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:23.657
OKAY.

01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:25.359
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE NUMBERS OF

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:28.295
CUSTOMERS THAT THEY SERVE BELOW.

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:29.830
SIX HUNDRED FICUS SCORE OF IT

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:30.397
SHOULD BE A VERY VERY SMALL

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:31.131
NUMBER.

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:33.233
THERE MAY BE OTHER REASONS WHY

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:33.700
THEY DO IT [inaudible]

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:36.803
BUT ANYTIME YOU HAVE A HIGH

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:38.138
INTEREST RATE YOU HAVE A RISK

01:44:38.205 --> 01:44:40.374
ASSOCIATED WITH IT WE UNDER

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.709
RIGHT ALL OF OUR LOANS --

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.811
WHETHER IN ALL OF OUR TITLE

01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:46.680
LOANS UNSECURED LOANS SO IT'S

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:49.783
NOT THAT WE DON'T DO A GOOD JOB.

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.084
AT UNDERWRITING.

01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:54.488
IT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE THAT.

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:56.189
WE ARE HIGHER RISK I TOLD YOU

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:58.692
WHAT THE WHATTHE THE RATES --

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:03.330
ARE THE 20% -- DEFAULT.

01:45:03.397 --> 01:45:05.666
AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE.

01:45:05.732 --> 01:45:08.068
YOUR IT'S A HIGHER RISK.

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:10.237
AND THEREFORE THAT'S WHY IT

01:45:10.303 --> 01:45:12.906
COSTS MORE FOR US TO GET MONEY A

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:14.074
TO BORROW MONEY TO LEND MONEY

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.742
OUT.

01:45:15.809 --> 01:45:18.879
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:20.847
LEND MONEY OUT AHEAD. TO OUR

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:22.149
CUSTOMER BASE AGAIN IT'S

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:23.850
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:26.887
CUSTOMER BASES I DON'T BELIEVE

01:45:26.953 --> 01:45:30.257
THAT MR GOVERNOR'S -- MEMBERS

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:32.959
SERVICE OUR CUSTOMER BASE IN ANY

01:45:33.026 --> 01:45:34.294
GREAT PERCENTAGES I COULD BE

01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:37.130
WRONG.

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:42.335
MAY I ACT WITH COMMONSENSE.

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:45.172
I'D LIKE THAT [inaudible]

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:48.775
BUT SO OBVIOUS THAT REPRESENT A

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:49.776
TRADE ASSOCIATION CELL I LISTEN

01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:50.944
TO MY MEMBERS AND WHAT THEY

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:51.511
CONVEY TO ME I ALSO KNOW.

01:45:51.578 --> 01:45:52.546
THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PILOT

01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:54.948
PROGRAM WHAT THEY HAVE CONVEYED

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:55.582
TO ME IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL

01:45:55.649 --> 01:45:57.317
COMPANIES. TO GIVE ME A SPECIFIC

01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:59.086
NUMBERS I'M NOT A POSITION TO DO

01:45:59.152 --> 01:46:01.088
THAT BUT AGAIN THEY HAVE ASSURED

01:46:01.154 --> 01:46:03.256
ME THEY TO ISSUE LOANS TO PEOPLE

01:46:03.323 --> 01:46:05.559
WITH ZERO FIVE THE SCORES.

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:07.661
AND THEY DO ISSUE LOANS TO GET

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:09.129
PEOPLE OUT OF THE HIGH INTEREST

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:10.430
LOANS THE NUMBERS.

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:12.299

DO THAT CERTAINLY I CAN TALK TO

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:14.000
THEM.

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:15.402
AND REACH OUT TO THE COMPANIES

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:18.872
AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD SHARE

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:19.439
BUT I'M NOT A POSITION TO DO

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:21.041
THAT.

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:22.075
IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING BUT

01:46:22.142 --> 01:46:23.577

OPPORTUNE REPORTS THAT THE

01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:34.855
AVERAGE PSYCHO IS SIX THIRTY

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:36.523
NINE MINUS -- SIX HUNDRED IN

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:37.657

GENERATING THAT WE DO WE DON'T.

01:51:59.779 --> 01:52:00.713
DISRUPT THE CUSTOMER'S

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:02.382
EXPERIENCE SO MUCH THAT THEY

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:05.552
MIGRATE AWAY FROM FROM THE FROM

01:52:05.618 --> 01:52:08.822
THE EXPERIENCE IN MOVE TO NON

01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:11.091
COMPLIANT LEAD GENERATORS WHICH

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:11.658
WILL LEAD THEM TO PREDATORY

01:52:11.724 --> 01:52:12.859
SITES.

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:14.928
THAT'S OUR CONCERN SO AT THE END

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:15.929
OF THE DAY I THINK HERE'S WHERE

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.831

PLEASE TO TO TO LOOK AT AND AND

01:52:21.601 --> 01:52:22.368
I THINK IF WE CAN TAKE CARE

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:23.870
THESE WE WOULD BE THERE ON THE

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:24.070
BILL.

01:52:24.137 --> 01:52:26.239
WITH YOU ONE OUR DISCLOSURES IN

01:52:26.306 --> 01:52:29.175
CONSENT -- OVER HALF OF OUR

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:31.044
CUSTOMERS NOW COME BY WAY OF

01:52:31.111 --> 01:52:32.645
CELL PHONE AND IF YOU KNOW BY

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:34.881
YOU KNOW CELL PHONE USE VERY

01:52:34.948 --> 01:52:37.283
QUICK ACTING -- BY REQUIRING

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:38.685
THEM TO DO WE DISCLOSE IN

01:52:38.751 --> 01:52:40.887
CONSENT MANY MANY TIMES

01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:41.521
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS WITH THE

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:44.624
I'M TO GO TO A NON COMPLIANT

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:45.692
LEAD GENERATOR HE'S GOING TO

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:46.693
SEND ME SOME MONEY.

01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:49.195
SO IF WE COULD GET A ONE AREA

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:50.630
FOR DISCLOSURE IN CONSENT I

01:52:50.697 --> 01:52:52.866
THINK THAT WOULD MAKE OUR OUR

01:52:52.932 --> 01:52:54.501
POSITION MUCH MUCH BETTER.

01:52:54.567 --> 01:52:56.136
SECONDLY OR THE TEN POINT FONT

01:52:56.202 --> 01:52:58.438
RIGHT NOW THE BILL HAS A VERY

01:52:58.505 --> 01:53:00.640
PRESCRIPTIVE TEN POINT POINT

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:03.076
FONT -- REQUIREMENT AGAIN WITH

01:53:03.143 --> 01:53:05.011
WITH MOBILE DEVICES THAT JUST

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:06.412
REALLY DOESN'T TRANSLATE TO THE

01:53:06.479 --> 01:53:08.581
EXPERIENCE FOR THE CONSUMER SO

01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:09.582
WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WORK

01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:11.651
WITH THE AUTHOR ON SOME SORT OF

01:53:11.718 --> 01:53:13.653
ON ME MIDDLE GROUND WHERE WE CAN

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.255
GET A LARGER FONT ESPECIALLY FOR

01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:15.788
THOSE.

01:53:15.855 --> 01:53:17.290
INSTANCES WHERE THE CONSUMERS

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:19.125
USING A MOLD MOBILE DEVICE AND

01:53:19.192 --> 01:53:21.561
FINALLY -- THE ISSUE OF AMNESTY

01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:23.029
WE HAVE MANY VERY GOOD LEE

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:24.197
GENERATORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY

01:53:24.264 --> 01:53:26.132
OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA WHO WANT

01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:27.267
TO BE COMPLIANT.

01:53:27.333 --> 01:53:32.205
BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ONCE

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:34.007
THE BILL PASSES IN IF DOES

01:53:34.073 --> 01:53:34.607
PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW.

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:35.241
THAT THEY AREN'T CUT OUT BECAUSE

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.643
THEY WERE ON ACTING AS A LEAD

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:37.310
GENERATOR SO WE WOULD LIKE SOME

01:53:37.377 --> 01:53:38.711
SORT OF AMNESTY PROVISION IN

01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:40.213
THERE SO THAT COMPLAIN LEE

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.015
GENERATORS CAN CONTINUE TO

01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:42.549
OPERATE IN THE STATE OF

01:53:42.615 --> 01:53:43.650
CALIFORNIA.

01:53:43.716 --> 01:53:44.918
SO ANYWAY IF WE COULD LOOK AT

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:46.219
THOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR I

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:48.154
THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE
