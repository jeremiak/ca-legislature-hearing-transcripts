MILES TO THE GROCERY STORE FROM

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:36.167

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:37.268
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:39.037

IT AFFECTS RULES A CALIFORNIA

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:42.507
AND WOULD MAKE. CITIZENS OF

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:43.508
CALIFORNIA IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:45.443
A FAIR TAX BASE WOULD-

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.279
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THEM

THEIR MARKS OUR CALLERS FROM

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:01.292
BAKERSFIELD I ACTUALLY THINK

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:02.860
THAT THE EXACT. OPPOSITE IS

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:04.362
TRUE IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.930
CURRENTLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:31:05.997 --> 00:31:07.465
TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES BECAUSE

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:10.501
OF- THE- IT'S A RURAL AREA OR

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:12.337
OR MORE SPREAD OUT AREA. THEY

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:13.871
ARE CURRENTLY PAYING MORE GAS

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:15.840
TAXES THAN PEOPLE WHO DRIVE

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:17.542
SHORT DISTANCES YOU HAVE TO

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:18.343
DRIVE A HUNDRED MILES EVERY

00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:20.778
DAY. THEN YOU'RE PAYING A LOT

00:31:20.845 --> 00:31:23.381
MORE GAS TAXES THAN SOMEONE IN

00:31:23.448 --> 00:31:26.217
AN URBAN SETTING. WHO IS- PAIN

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:27.619
DRIVING FIVE OR TEN MILES A DAY

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:30.722
SO WHETHER IT'S VMT OR GAS TAX

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:31.923
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.091
LONGER DISTANCES THEY'RE GOING

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:34.492
TO PAY MORE AND THAT DOESN'T

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.694
CHANGE WHEN YOU TRANSITION.

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:37.662
FROM GAS TAX TO BE ABOUT MILES

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.797

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:41.399
SPEAKING OF SAN FRANCISCO.

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:42.100
THERE ARE A LOT OF SAN

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:44.402
FRANCISCANS AND OTHER URBAN

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:46.971
DWELLERS WHO WILL BE. IMPACTED

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:48.573
AND PAY MORE BECAUSE OF THE

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.275
ANTI BECAUSE THEY HAVE A ZERO

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:52.210

00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:02.587
FROM BAKERSFIELD. KING ZERO IN

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:04.289
GAS TAXES BECAUSE THEY USE NO

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:07.392
GAS. THEY WILL PAY FOR BMT AND

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:08.760
THEY SHOULD BECAUSE THAT IS THE

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:10.028
EQUITABLE THING TO DO BECAUSE

00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:11.095
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A ZERO

00:32:11.162 --> 00:32:12.530

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:18.536

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:21.039
WHAT DO WE DO. AS GAS TAXES

LIKELIHOOD OF PREMATURE BIRTHS

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:46.394
NATURAL WILDLIFE. EFFECTS OF

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.762
DDT ARE BELIEVED TO LEAD TO THE

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.164
DISAPPEARANCE OF NUMERACY BIRDS

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:50.198

PELICANS AND CORMORANTS. ARE

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:55.170
MOST DEPRESSING WAS TO SEE OUR

BEAUTIFUL NATIONAL SYMBOL THE

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:58.740
BALD EAGLE- SO THAT THEIR THEIR

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:03.378
LITTLE BAGS. THANK SHELL SO

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:04.179
TERRIBLY DAMAGED. NOW WHY DO

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.980
THIS HAPPEN HOW DID THIS HAPPEN.

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:08.283
WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT FOR A

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.984
LONG TIME THERE WAS A

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:12.354
PARTICULAR COMPANY THAT WAS

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.789
SIMPLY JUST DUMPING. BARRELS

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:17.025
AND BARRELS- IT WE'VE WE'VE NOW

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:18.760
WITH THE ESTIMATES NOW WITH

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.528
RECENT MAPPING FROM NO- AND-

01:23:20.595 --> 01:23:21.896
RESEARCHERS FROM UC SANTA

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:23.098
BARBARA SUGGESTED THAT MORE

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:25.467
THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:28.303
BARRELS. OF DDT WASTE WERE

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.205
DUMPED. OFF FAR SHORT. MAKING

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:31.406
IT ONE OF THE LARGEST SOURCES

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:33.074
OF CONTAMINANTS IN THE ENTIRE

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:36.578
PACIFIC OCEAN. SO THIS IS AN

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:38.179
ENORMOUS PROBLEM THE LA TIMES

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.414
TODAY A FASCINATING AND VERY

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:41.549
DEPRESSING- EXPOSE ON THIS

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:44.219
ISSUE. WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:45.253
LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.322
ASSOCIATED WITH REMEDIATING I.

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:48.923
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THESE

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:50.024
BARRELS ARE SO DEEP IN THE

01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:51.559
OCEAN THAT THEY'RE VERY HARD TO

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:52.994
GET TO AND EVEN JUST LIFTING

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:54.362
THEM UP MAY END UP STIRRING UP

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:56.564
SO MUCH TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:57.966
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. SO WE NEED

01:23:58.032 --> 01:23:59.334
FEDERAL ACTION WE NEED FEDERAL

INTEGRITY THAT WE HAVING

02:01:45.464 --> 02:01:48.334
CREATES. A MECHANISM AND TO

EXPANDED AND- WE SHOULD HAVE

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:54.407
SOME RAUD MECHANISMS IN PLACE

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:57.710
BEFORE WE MAKE THIS LAW

PRESIDENT- I THINK THAT THE-

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.122
THAT THE ONLY REASON THAT THERE

02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:13.492
IS DISTRUSTS BY ANYONE IN OUR

02:02:13.559 --> 02:02:16.462
VOTING SYSTEM IS BECAUSE OF THE

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:19.765
UNFOUNDED FALSE CONSPIRACY

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:22.168
THEORIES THAT ARE BEING SPREAD

02:02:22.234 --> 02:02:25.538
ON SOCIAL MEDIA- ON FOX NEWS-

02:02:25.604 --> 02:02:28.908
AND OTHER- RIGHT WING OUTLETS

02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:29.709
THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY

02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:31.944
SPREADING FALSE CONSPIRACY

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:34.113
THEORIES TO TRY TO UNDERMINE

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.482
TRUST IN OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM

02:02:36.549 --> 02:02:39.518
ON OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. THAT'S

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:40.019
THE ONLY REASON THERE'S

02:02:40.086 --> 02:02:41.954
DISTRUST. EXPANDING THE ABILITY

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:44.590
TO VOTE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:46.926
DOING TODAY THAT DOES NOT-

02:02:46.992 --> 02:02:48.761
REDUCE TRUST OF COURSE IF IT'S

02:02:48.828 --> 02:02:50.362
DISTORTED INTO A CONSPIRACY

02:02:50.429 --> 02:02:53.432
THEORY BY FOX NEWS AT ALL- THE

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:54.734
INDICTMENT AFFILIATION CAN

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.335
REDUCE TRUST BUT WHAT WE'RE

02:02:56.402 --> 02:02:59.472
DOING HERE TODAY. IS TRYING TO

02:02:59.538 --> 02:03:03.309
EXPAND THE AND MAKE IT EASIER.

02:03:03.375 --> 02:03:04.677
FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE WE'RE DOING

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:06.445
THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS

02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:09.415
HAPPENING IN PLACES LIKE TEXAS.

02:03:09.482 --> 02:03:11.917
AND GEORGIA. AND SOME OF THESE%

02:03:11.984 --> 02:03:13.719
OTHER STATES THAT ARE TRYING TO

02:03:13.786 --> 02:03:15.187
MAKE A REALLY REALLY REALLY

02:03:15.254 --> 02:03:17.990
HARD. FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE AND

02:03:18.057 --> 02:03:19.892

02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:24.864
COLOR FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE FOR

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.432
STUDENTS TRYING TO MAKE IT HARD

02:03:26.499 --> 02:03:27.767
FOR THEM TO VOTE IN ORDER TO

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:28.634
MANIPULATE THE RESULTS OF THE

02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:30.669
ELECTION. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

02:03:30.736 --> 02:03:32.071
LET'S HAVE EVERYONE GO LET'S

02:03:32.138 --> 02:03:33.272
SEND IT TO REPUBLICANS AND

02:03:33.339 --> 02:03:34.640
DEMOCRATS AND SENIORS AND

PROCESS AND I ALSO FEAR I'VE-

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:00.065

02:06:55.574 --> 02:06:57.109
MOTOR VOTER WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:06:57.176 --> 02:06:59.979
MISS REGISTERED. AS REPUBLICANS

02:07:00.045 --> 02:07:00.679
WHEN THEY WANTED TO BE

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:02.815
DEMOCRATS DID WE NOT REPORT

02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:04.817
THAT YOU BET YOUR BOTTOM WE

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:06.719
REPORTED IT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:09.188
RIGHT AND WE HAD PEOPLE WHO

02:07:09.254 --> 02:07:12.024
RECEIVED TWO BALLOTS ARE DID WE

02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:13.792
REPORT THAT YOU BET YOUR BOTTOM

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:16.195
WE DID FOR THE TWO ACCUSED US

02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:17.129
OF BEING THE ONES THAT HAVE

02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:19.031
CREATED THIS FALSE NARRATIVE

02:07:19.098 --> 02:07:20.532
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MANY

02:07:20.599 --> 02:07:22.534
STORIES ACROSS THIS NATION THAT

02:07:22.601 --> 02:07:24.570
VALIDATE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF

02:07:24.636 --> 02:07:25.938
TRUST BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE

02:07:26.005 --> 02:07:28.340
EXPERIENCED THESE VERY THINGS

02:07:28.407 --> 02:07:30.776
SO I CALL ON ATTORNEY GENERAL I

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.544
CALL ON OUR SECRETARY OF STATE

02:07:32.611 --> 02:07:34.313
AND I CALL ON THIS BODY. THE

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.415
STOP PROPAGATING THE FALSE

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:38.183
NARRATIVE LET'S GET DOWN TO THE

02:07:38.250 --> 02:07:39.485
BOTTOM OF IT AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:41.320
THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT

02:07:41.387 --> 02:07:43.389
REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS THEIR

02:07:43.455 --> 02:07:45.124
RIGHTS ARE PRESERVED AND IF WE

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:47.926
KEEP TURNING A DELPHI OUR IDEA

02:07:47.993 --> 02:07:49.762
OF FEAR IN A BLIND GUY JUST

02:07:49.828 --> 02:07:51.864
BECAUSE FOX NEWS- SOMETHING

02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:53.832
THAT'S WRONG WE ARE ALL

02:07:53.899 --> 02:07:59.538
INTELLIGENT. EDUCATED AND WE

02:07:59.605 --> 02:08:00.139
KNOW WE IT GET HERE WITHOUT

02:08:00.205 --> 02:08:00.773
BEING OF THE P. BY THE PEOPLE

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:01.273
IN FOR THE P. WHICH IS

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:04.043
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

02:08:04.109 --> 02:08:05.577
AND THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO

02:08:05.644 --> 02:08:09.114
THANK YOU. CENTERMAN. I WOULD

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:10.516
JUST NOTE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:12.718
MANY STUDIES INCLUDING BY

02:08:12.785 --> 02:08:15.020
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. AND

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:16.855
NATIONAL LEVEL TO STATE LEVEL

02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:19.792
AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:20.626
THERE'S BEEN ANY ELECTION

02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:23.195
FRAUD- OR OR ANYTHING OTHER

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:24.830
THAN MINUTE DIMINISHED ALEXION

02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:26.799
FRAUD WHEN IT COMES TO-

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.534
INDIVIDUAL VOTER FRAUD. THE

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:29.635
MAJOR THREATS TO ELECTION

02:08:29.701 --> 02:08:32.071
SECURITY COME FROM HACKING

02:08:32.137 --> 02:08:33.839
CYBER SECURITY AT ALL. AND I

02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:35.107
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AT THE

02:08:35.174 --> 02:08:37.509
NATIONAL LEVEL- OUR REPUBLICAN

02:08:37.576 --> 02:08:39.011
COUNTERPARTS HAVE CONSISTENTLY

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:40.813
BLOCKED EFFORTS TO TRY TO.

02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:42.114
INCREASE FUNDING FOR ELECTION

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:44.016
SECURITY CYBERSECURITY ALIKE

02:08:44.083 --> 02:08:46.118
WHILE FOCUSING ON THESE VERY

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:48.187
RANDOM. CASES THERE FORTY

02:08:48.253 --> 02:08:49.488
MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:50.322
SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE

02:08:50.389 --> 02:08:52.357
MILLION VOTERS HI THAT MEANS

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:53.425
INEVITABLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:55.094
OCCASIONAL MISTAKES BUT THE

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:55.627
IDEA THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW

02:08:55.694 --> 02:08:57.830
SYSTEMIC. ARE YOU CAN TAKE

02:08:57.896 --> 02:08:59.598
ISOLATED INCIDENTS AND TRY TO

02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:01.500
PORTRAY THEM INTO NARRATIVE AND

02:09:01.567 --> 02:09:02.835
I THINK THAT IS ALL ECHO THE

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:04.503
COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.205
SPOKEN BEFORE. THERE IS A

02:09:06.271 --> 02:09:07.506
DELIBERATE ATTEMPT RIGHT NOW TO

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:09.007
TRY TO PAINT A NARRATIVE THAT

02:09:09.074 --> 02:09:10.576
THERE IS SYSTEMIC ELECTION

02:09:10.642 --> 02:09:12.377
FRAUD HAPPENING. AND I THINK

02:09:12.444 --> 02:09:13.745
THIS IS COMPLETELY LUDICROUS

02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:15.380
IT'S BEEN DEBUNKED BY EVERYONE

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:16.715
INCLUDING BY REPUBLICANS HAVE

02:09:16.782 --> 02:09:18.083
GONE UP AND TRY TO FIND

02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:19.751
EVIDENCE OF ELECTION FRAUD. THE

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:20.919
MAJOR THREAT TO OUR ELECTION

02:09:20.986 --> 02:09:22.054
SECURITY AGAIN IS CYBER

02:09:22.121 --> 02:09:23.922
SECURITY IT'S NOT FROM THESE

02:09:23.989 --> 02:09:25.624
EXCESS BALLOTS PAPER BALLOTS IN

02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:27.392
THE LIKE AND SO I RESPECTFULLY

02:09:27.459 --> 02:09:28.093
ASK YOUR EYE BUT THIS IS A

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:29.795
COMMON SENSE MEASURE. AT A TIME

02:09:29.862 --> 02:09:32.164
WHEN TOO MANY STATES ARE TRYING

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:33.465
TO LIMIT OUR FRANCHISE OUR

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:34.833
HEARD EARNED RIGHT TO VOTE

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.101
WHETHER IT'S FOR WOMEN OR

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:37.402
MINORITIES OR FOR MANY OF US

02:09:37.469 --> 02:09:38.804
WHO'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO VOTE

02:09:38.871 --> 02:09:40.939
FOR A FEW GENERATIONS. IT'S

02:09:41.006 --> 02:09:42.741
IMPERATIVE THAT WE EMPHASIZE

02:09:42.808 --> 02:09:44.943
THAT IN A DEMOCRACY THE RIGHT

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:46.278
TO VOTE IS AT THE HEART OF THAT

02:09:46.345 --> 02:09:48.213
AND WE THIS IS A BILL THAT THAT

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.049
FURTHERS THAT CAUSE SO AGAIN I

02:09:51.116 --> 02:09:53.051
ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SENATOR

02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:57.356
BURGESS I. REALLY WASN'T

02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:59.791
PLANNING THANK YOU NINE PRESENT

02:09:59.858 --> 02:10:00.359
WAS A PLAN AND TALKING ABOUT

02:10:00.425 --> 02:10:03.762
THIS. I THINK THERE'S THERE

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:05.564
THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT POINTS

02:10:05.631 --> 02:10:08.667
THAT BOTH. SIDES HAVE MADE ON

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:11.603
THIS ISSUE- LAST WEEK I

02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:13.338
RECEIVED TWO BALLOTS. IN THE

02:10:13.405 --> 02:10:17.442
RECALL. AND I'M CERTAIN I'M NOT

02:10:17.509 --> 02:10:19.611
ALONE ONE WENT TO MY PRIMARY

02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:21.647
ADDRESS AND I FILLED OUT AND

02:10:21.713 --> 02:10:23.815
MAILED IT IN AND THEN ANOTHER

02:10:23.882 --> 02:10:26.585
CAME A COUPLE DAYS LATER TO- MY

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:29.988
IN LAWS HOUSE. NOW I AM NOT OF

02:10:30.055 --> 02:10:32.824
THE OPINION THAT. THERE IS A

02:10:32.891 --> 02:10:36.461
SYSTEMIC EFFORT IN MY HOME

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:42.768
COUNTY TO UNDO ELECTIONS- IN A

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.770
AT A MASS SCALE THAT CAN CHANGE

02:10:44.836 --> 02:10:47.239
THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION BUT

02:10:47.306 --> 02:10:47.773
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY

02:10:47.839 --> 02:10:50.442
IMPORTANT- INTO THE POINT MADE

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:53.078
EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUE- FROM.

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:55.747
IRVINE AND ONE EARLIER BY MY

02:10:55.814 --> 02:10:58.083
COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD. IS

02:10:58.150 --> 02:11:00.285
THAT IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO

02:11:00.352 --> 02:11:02.287
WORK WITH OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS.

02:11:02.354 --> 02:11:04.590
ARE STATE OFFICIALS. TO MAKE

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:06.558
CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE. HAVE

02:11:06.625 --> 02:11:08.961
GREATER TRUST IN OUR VOTING

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:11.530
PROCESS WORKS SO IF I'M GETTING

02:11:11.597 --> 02:11:14.700
TWO BALLOTS- I KNOW THAT OTHERS

02:11:14.766 --> 02:11:16.134
ARE ARE GETTING MULTIPLE

02:11:16.201 --> 02:11:17.703
BALLOTS AS WELL THAT FEEDS INTO

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:20.572
THIS NARRATIVE. OF DISTRUST. SO

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.541
MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE CLEAN UP

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:24.509
THE VOTER ROLLS IN A WAY THAT

02:11:24.576 --> 02:11:26.378
ALSO CAN BE PUT OUT THERE INTO

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:28.447
THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT THEY ARE

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:31.183
IN FACT. CLEAN AND MORE UP TO

02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:33.719
DATE WOULD BE TERRIBLY HELPFUL.

02:11:33.785 --> 02:11:36.421
SENATOR MELINDA IS THANK YOU

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:37.889
MADAM PRESIDENT- LADIES AND

02:11:37.956 --> 02:11:41.660
GENTLEMEN. R. I WOULD BE

02:11:41.727 --> 02:11:44.096
SURPRISED IF THERE ARE MEMBERS

02:11:44.162 --> 02:11:45.564
OF THIS BODY WHO HAVE NOT

02:11:45.631 --> 02:11:48.267
RECEIVED PHONE CALLS OR EMAILS

02:11:48.333 --> 02:11:48.867
FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS SAYING

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:52.004
THAT. THEY OR SOMEONE THEY KNOW

02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:53.839
RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE BALLOT

02:11:53.905 --> 02:11:55.807
OR THEY OR SOMEONE THEY KNOW

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:57.309
RECEIVE DEVELOPER SOMEONE WHO

02:11:57.376 --> 02:11:59.745
IS DECEASED- THIS HAPPENS ALL

02:11:59.811 --> 02:12:01.213
THE TIME AND I GET THESE TYPES

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:02.848
OF COMMENTS FROM DEMOCRATS AS

02:12:02.914 --> 02:12:04.283
WELL AS REPUBLICANS IN MY

02:12:04.349 --> 02:12:06.918
DISTRICT WHO HAVE CONCERNS.

02:12:06.985 --> 02:12:08.854
WITH BALLOT INTEGRITY THIS IS.

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:10.022
IT'S MORE THAN A LITTLE

02:12:10.088 --> 02:12:11.623
DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR ANYBODY

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:13.558
ON THIS FLOOR STAND UP AND SAY

02:12:13.625 --> 02:12:15.427
THAT THIS IS A PARTISAN ISSUE.

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:17.996
BECAUSE IT IS NOT IT IS AN

02:12:18.063 --> 02:12:19.965
ISSUE OF SIFT SYSTEMIC

02:12:20.032 --> 02:12:22.200
MISTRUST. OF THE SYSTEM THAT

02:12:22.267 --> 02:12:23.435
HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND THAT

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:25.570
HAS DEGRADED TO A POINT WHERE

02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:28.440
PEOPLE DON'T FEEL. THAT THE

02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:29.174
SYSTEM IS WORKING THE WAY IT IS

02:12:29.241 --> 02:12:31.610
SUPPOSED TO- I DON'T KNOW WHY

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:33.245
ANYBODY WOULD BE OPPOSED TO

02:12:33.312 --> 02:12:34.680
MAKING SURE THAT THE VOTER

02:12:34.746 --> 02:12:36.915
ROLLS. ARE CLEAN THE PEOPLE WHO

02:12:36.982 --> 02:12:38.417
ARE DECEASED OR NOT GETTING

02:12:38.483 --> 02:12:40.619
BALLOTS SICK PEOPLE. WHO DO GET

02:12:40.686 --> 02:12:41.987
A BALLAD DON'T GET ANOTHER ONE

02:12:42.054 --> 02:12:44.189
A FEW DAYS LATER THIS IS COMMON

02:12:44.256 --> 02:12:46.658
SENSE EVERYONE SHOULD BE FOR

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:47.959
THESE TYPES OF MEASURES TO MAKE

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:48.994
SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS

02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:50.962
WORKING. THE WAY IT IS INTENDED

02:12:51.029 --> 02:12:52.331
SO IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE

02:12:52.397 --> 02:12:54.833
DESPITE SOME THE TRY TO MAKE IT

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:58.704
INTO THAT- AND I WOULD- JUST

02:12:58.770 --> 02:13:01.106
ASK YOU MAYBE PERHAPS. GO BACK

WERE TAKEN TO ACCOUNT C. LEVEL

03:53:54.653 --> 03:53:55.788
RISE IN HALF THE STAKE HOLDER

03:53:55.855 --> 03:53:57.890

03:54:06.198 --> 03:54:08.033
THAT AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD. A

03:54:08.100 --> 03:54:09.502
COUPLE OF YEARS LATER I'M

03:54:09.568 --> 03:54:11.036
APPOINTED NATURAL RESOURCES

03:54:11.103 --> 03:54:13.139
SECRETARY AND I AM IN CHARGE OF

03:54:13.205 --> 03:54:15.107
THE SCIENCE THAT ESTABLISHES

03:54:15.174 --> 03:54:19.111
THE BENCHMARK AND AS WE IN

03:54:19.178 --> 03:54:20.246
TWENTY ELEVEN ON THE SAME DAY

03:54:20.312 --> 03:54:22.348
AS THE JAPANESE TSUNAMI.

03:54:22.415 --> 03:54:24.683
ADOPTED THE SCIENCE IN

03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:28.254
CALIFORNIA IT BASICALLY SAID

03:54:28.320 --> 03:54:33.125
THAT WE WOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN

03:54:33.192 --> 03:54:34.026
TWENTY FIFTY THAT WOULD BE

03:54:34.093 --> 03:54:35.327
EIGHT INCHES OR SOMETHING SEA

03:54:35.394 --> 03:54:36.829
LEVEL RISE BUT THAT WAS THE

03:54:36.896 --> 03:54:39.231
MEDIAN IF WE REALLY COULDN'T ON

03:54:39.298 --> 03:54:41.000
ARE LOWERING EMISSIONSSHOULD

03:54:41.066 --> 03:54:43.269
BE LESS IF WE REALLY BAD WOULD

03:54:43.335 --> 03:54:44.036
BE HIGHER THAN THE NUMBER OF

03:54:44.103 --> 03:54:48.707
FEET. AT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AND

03:54:48.774 --> 03:54:50.743
SO THE THING I ASKED THE

03:54:50.810 --> 03:54:52.278
SCIENTISTS AT THE TIME AS

03:54:52.344 --> 03:54:53.446
PEOPLE WERE SKEPTICAL ABOUT

03:54:53.512 --> 03:54:55.147
LOOKING FOR WORK LET'S LOOK

03:54:55.214 --> 03:54:56.949
BACKWARD AND THEY SAID SEVEN

03:54:57.016 --> 03:54:59.552
INCHES IN OUR AREA THE CITY HAS

03:54:59.618 --> 03:55:01.554
RISEN SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL

03:55:01.620 --> 03:55:03.923
RUSSELL REVOLUTION. AND SO NOW

03:55:03.989 --> 03:55:05.958
WE KEEP MOVING AHEAD WITH

03:55:06.025 --> 03:55:06.826
DIFFERENT THINGS AND WORKED ON

03:55:06.892 --> 03:55:08.861
THE SCIENCE WE SEEM TO KNOW

03:55:08.928 --> 03:55:11.030
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND THIS BILL

03:55:11.096 --> 03:55:13.232
IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP

03:55:13.299 --> 03:55:15.367
BECAUSE IT BRINGS PEOPLE AROUND

03:55:15.434 --> 03:55:17.336
ALL OVER THE STATE TO ACTUALLY

03:55:17.403 --> 03:55:19.772
PLAN TO ACTUALLY DECIDE HOW

03:55:19.839 --> 03:55:21.207
WERE WE GOING TO BRIDGE IT SO

03:55:21.273 --> 03:55:23.476
IF YOU LOOK AT SENATOR DODD'S

03:55:23.542 --> 03:55:26.111
DISTRICT ON THE HIGHWAY THIRTY

03:55:26.178 --> 03:55:27.480
SEVEN OR IN THAT AREA. IT'S

03:55:27.546 --> 03:55:29.014
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO IF YOU

03:55:29.081 --> 03:55:34.587
LOOK AT SENATOR AIKMAN'S.

03:55:34.653 --> 03:55:36.689
DISTRICT A ONE- FORT. ARISE

03:55:36.755 --> 03:55:38.791
SINCE LEVEL. WOULD CHANGE THE

03:55:38.858 --> 03:55:39.892
TWO FIVE HUNDRED YEARS. TO A

03:55:39.959 --> 03:55:41.427
TEN YEAR FLOOD IN THE WESTERN

03:55:41.494 --> 03:55:43.462
DELTA. SO THESE ARE THINGS WE

03:55:43.529 --> 03:55:45.097
CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM AND THIS

03:55:45.164 --> 03:55:47.900
BILL HELPS US IN A WAY THAT

03:55:47.967 --> 03:55:49.435
THAT WE CAN DO OUR BEST TO BE

03:55:49.502 --> 03:55:53.339
READY SO I SALUTE THE AUTHORS

03:55:53.405 --> 03:55:54.373

IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SP ONE AND

03:56:02.381 --> 03:56:04.250
I TO LIKE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM

03:56:04.316 --> 03:56:06.619
STOCKTON- REPRESENTS NOT A

03:56:06.685 --> 03:56:08.387
COASTAL REGION BUT SOMETHING A

03:56:08.454 --> 03:56:09.989
LITTLE MORE INLAND FACT FREE

03:56:10.055 --> 03:56:11.891
RIGHT HERE AND AS WE SIT HERE

03:56:11.957 --> 03:56:14.293
DEBATING THIS BILL- PERHAPS WE

03:56:14.360 --> 03:56:15.528
OUGHT TO GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO

03:56:15.594 --> 03:56:17.329
EXACTLY HOW MANY FEET WE ARE

03:56:17.396 --> 03:56:19.465
ABOVE SEA LEVEL. AS WE SIT HERE

03:56:19.532 --> 03:56:22.835
RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT SEA

03:56:22.902 --> 03:56:24.403
LEVEL RISE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

03:56:24.470 --> 03:56:25.371
SEA LEVEL RISE WHAT THIS IS

03:56:25.437 --> 03:56:26.872
ABOUT AND I THINK IT'S

03:56:26.939 --> 03:56:27.740
MENTIONED BY TO MY COLLEAGUES

03:56:27.806 --> 03:56:30.075
BEFORE. YOU KNOW ONE FOOT RISE

03:56:30.142 --> 03:56:31.610
IN SEA LEVEL CERTAINLY IS GOING

03:56:31.677 --> 03:56:34.179
TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE COAST

03:56:34.246 --> 03:56:34.813
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY CHALLENGE FOR

03:56:34.880 --> 03:56:36.749
US RIGHT HERE. YOU KNOW THE

03:56:36.815 --> 03:56:38.450
TERMS OF FLOOD RISK SO WE

03:56:38.517 --> 03:56:40.052
USUALLY WORRY ABOUT. FLOODS

03:56:40.119 --> 03:56:41.787
COMING FROM THE FOOTHILLS

03:56:41.854 --> 03:56:43.923
GREAT. UNSERE AS COMING DOWN

03:56:43.989 --> 03:56:45.524
WITH A PINEAPPLE EXPRESS OR

03:56:45.591 --> 03:56:47.660
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WELL DON'T

03:56:47.726 --> 03:56:48.460
FORGET WATER TO BACK UP THE

03:56:48.527 --> 03:56:51.530
OTHER WAY. A TEN FOOT RISE I

03:56:51.597 --> 03:56:53.432
THINK WOULD BASICALLY MAKE

03:56:53.499 --> 03:56:54.900
BOTH. MY GOOD FRIEND FROM
