THANK YOU GOOD THANK YOU GET MORE. CAITLYN O'NEILL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF RECENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE STATE'S INMATE POPULATION I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT I BELIEVE MAY HAVE BEEN IN YOUR BRIEFING MATERIALS AND IF NOT THE SERGEANTS HAVE EXTRA COPIES GREAT- THAT'S I BELIEVE FINANCES UP SORRY. SARS IS CALLED IMPACT OF RECENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICIES ON THE STATE'S INMATE POPULATION THAT'S RIGHT YES WE HAVE IT ARE A GREAT AND THERE SHOULD BE EXTRA COPIES FOR THE AUDIENCE AS WELL. OKAY MEANING TO PAGE ONE. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE FEDERAL COURTS RULED THAT THE STATE'S PROVISION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND MEDICAL CARE FOR INMATES WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY AN ADEQUATE. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AB PLAINTIFFS IN THOSE TWO LAWSUITS FILED MOTIONS TO CONVENE A FOR A FEDERAL THREE JUDGE PANEL. TO ASSESS FIRST WHETHER PRISON OVERCROWDING WAS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE STATE'S INABILITY TO DELIVER ADEQUATE INMATE HEALTHCARE. AND SECOND WHETHER PRISONER RLEASE ORDER WAS THE ONLY WAY TO REMEDY THOSE CONDITIONS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE PANEL DECLARE THAT PERMIT PRISON OVERCROWDING WAS INDEED THE RE THE PRIMARY REASON BEHIND THE STATE'S INABILITY TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE- IN MADE HEALTHCARE. AND IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THE PANEL ORDERED THE STATE TO REDUCE THE CAPACITY OF THE STATE OWNED PRISONS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT 5% OF THEIR DESIGN CAPACITY. DESIGN CAPACITY GENERALLY REFERS TO THE NUMBER OF INMATES THAT PRISONS COULD HOUSE IF THEY HAD. ONE INMATE PURCELL AND GENERALLY DID NOT DOUBLE BUNK IN DORMITORIES. I AM SO BASED ON THAT MEASURE CDC ARE- MUCH CURRENTLY LIMIT THE POPULATION OF ITS THIRTY FOUR STATE OWNED PRISONS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN AT TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND INMATES. BASED ON THEIR CURRENT CAPACITY. AND THEN TURNING THE PAGE TO PAGE TWO THE STATE TOOK VARIOUS ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT ORDER INCLUDING A CONTRACTING FOR PRISON CAPACITY AS WELL AS BUILDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. IN ADDITION THE STATE IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE WRITTEN THAT ALSO HELP THE STATE TO COMPLY BY REDUCING THE OVERALL INMATE POPULATION I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE THE MAJOR POLICY CHANGES ON THE NEXT PAGE. STARTING WITH THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. WHICH LIMITED WHO WHO COULD BE SENT TO PRISON- AND INSTEAD REQUIRED THAT LOWER LEVEL FELONS GENERALLY A SERVE THEIR TERM RENTAL AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND REQUIRE THAT COUNTIES SUPERVISE LOWER LEVEL PHONES GENERALLY WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED FROM PRISON RATHER THAN STATE PATROL AGENTS. PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX WHICH IS A PROVIDE THE VOTERS IN TWENTY TWELVE. I CHANGE THE STATE'S THREE STRIKES LAW- BUT GENERALLY ELIMINATING A LIFE SENTENCE FOR OFFENDERS WHO HAVE TO PRIOR SERIES IN MYLAN FELONIES ALSO KNOWN AS STRIKES- AND THEN THEIR THIRD- FELONY IS NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT SO ELIMINATED GENERALLY LIFE SENTENCES FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS- AS WELL AS A LINE RE SENTENCING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY SERVING. TERMS FOR SERVING THOSE SENTENCES. PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN WHICH WAS APPROVED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. REDUCE PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN ON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT DRUG AND PROPERTY CRIMES AND ALSO ALLOWED FOR RE SENTENCING. AND PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- REDUCED THE ADULTIN THE OVER AT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT INMATES SPEND IN PRISON. PRIMARILY THROUGH EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR PAROLE CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS EXPANDING CCAR'S AUTHORITY TO REDUCE INMATES TERMS THE CREDITS. THAT INMATES EARNED THROUGH PART. IN THE ABILITY XIN GRAMS AND MAINTAINING GOOD BEHAVIOR WHILE INCARCERATED. WHEN THERE'S BEEN VARIOUS OTHER SENTENCING CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE PAST DECADE. THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE IN- INMATE POPULATION THESE ARE JUST THE MAJOR ONES. IN ON THE NEXT PAGE YOU'LL SEE A FIGURE THAT SHOWS THE ON GOING DECLINE IN THE STATE'S INMATE POPULATION- BEGINNING IN. HERE WE SHOW BEGINNING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN THE EFFECTS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN STARTED TO TAKE HOLD- AND SPECIFICALLY THE POPULATION DECLINED- BY ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED INMATES ARE 4% BETWEEN JUNE THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND- JUNE THIRTY TWENTY NINETEEN. AND IS PROJECTED TO DECLINE BY IAM EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED INMATES OR IS UNTIL JUNE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS TO CLIENTS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN- DRIVEN BY PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN- AND THEN I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE DID ADDRESS THESE THE PROJECTIONS HERE SPECIFICALLY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE- ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF SB ONE THIRTY SIX- CHOPPERED IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH ELIMINATES A ONE YEAR SENTENCE FOR PRIOR OFFENSES IN CERTAIN CASES. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS LATER WHENEVER IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR THIS ONE OFTEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT INTRODUCED MY COLLEAGUE GARETH EDWARDS WHO'S HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL. A WHAT I'LL BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE INVESTMENTS THAT MADE IN THIS AREA IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AND THEN PROVIDE WITH MISTER EDWARDS OUR PERSPECTIVE ON SOME OF THE POPULATION TRENDS THAT THE LA- DISCUSSED. TO THE OVERALL CDC ARE BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN JANUARY IS THIRTEEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND WITHIN THIS WHEN IT COMES TO NEW INVESTMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY PUTTING AN EMPHASIS ON REHABILITATION. AND RE ENTRY THIS BUILDS ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE OF THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED IN THE BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR- RANGING FROM COMMUNITY REENTRY FACILITIES TO INVESTMENTS IN LITERACY PROGRAMS TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. AS WELL AS THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH IN COMMITTEE RESTORATION THAT WILL BE FULLY IN EFFECT LATER THIS YEAR. IN THE BUDGET THIS. BUT AND THIS IS HOW TO BE ABLE TATIAN A RE ENTRY. COMES IN A NUMBER FORMS A COME IN TERM OF INVEST IN AT. RANGING FROM TECHNO INVESTMENTS FOR VOCATIONAL AND ACADEMIC TRAINING AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION AS IT RELATES TO INMATES INCLUDING A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH. CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. THERE'S ALSO A NEW FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL VISITATION DAYS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH INMATES WITH PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THAT WILL FACILITATE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY. THERE IS TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT TO INCREASE THE CAPABILITY OF STAFF AS THEY DEAL WITH INMATES. AND THEN FINALLY A NEW PROBATION REFORM INITIATIVE AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION FOR COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AS WELL AS ENHANCE JAIL OVERSIGHT. SO ALL THESE EFFORTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE INMATES THEMSELVES FOR FAMILIES AND FOR COMMUNITIES. THEY'RE ALSO IMPORTANT HE JUST LOOKING AT THE STATE BUDGET WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE COSTS OF CDC OUR IN THE MONEY THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO THESE PROGRAMS. AND CERTAINLY SEE MINISTRATIONS HOPE OVER TIME TO BE ABLE TO BEND THE COST CURVE PROMOTE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE AND THEN EVENTUALLY AS WE SAVE MONEY PROJECTED TO WHAT WE MIGHT SPEND. REPURPOSE. THOSE FUNDS FOR OTHER PURPOSES. AT THE LA ALL NINETEEN CAL REMAINS. TO THE COURT OR- CAP THE ONE HUNDRED THIRD SEVEN POINT 5% OF DESIGN. CAPACITY AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE POPULATION AS REPRESENTED IN THE LA- START HAS TRENDED DOWNWARD AND IT'S OUR PROJECTION AND WILL CONTINUE TO TREND DOWNWARD. IN FACT BETWEEN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YEAR OF TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE PROJECTING AN ADDITIONAL APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND IN MAY REDUCTION. IN TERMS OF THE STATE PRISON POPULATION AND WE'RE SEEING THIS AND SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE LAST YEAR. AS YOU KNOW LAST JUNE THE ADMINISTRATION- CDC ARE TERMINATED THE FINAL OUT OF STATE CONTRACTORS SOLELY IN ARIZONA. SO THAT NOW ALL STATE PRISON INMATES ARE HOUSED WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION FACED OUT ANOTHER PRIVATE IN STATE CONTRACT FACILITY LAST SEPTEMBER. AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THREE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IS TO CONTINUE TO PHASE OUT AND STATE CONTRACT FACILITIES AND FINALLY WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THE GOVERNOR HAS ANNOUNCED AN INTENTION TO CLOSE THE STATE PRISON IF CURRENT POPULATION TRENDS HOLD. AND SO THAT CERTAINLY THE OBJECTIVE AT THE SAME TIME I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE. IS IF CURRENT POPULAR TRENDS HOLE AND FURTHERMORE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY RIGHT NOW WHICH PRISON MIGHT BE SLATED FOR CLOSURE. THAT'S A FACTOR IS. COME ON RIGHT CLICK. EIGHT OKAY SO NOTATION AND RE ENTRY IS TO MONITOR CARE IS THE POPULATION CONVENIENT DECLINE WHICH SEPTEMBER WITH THAT POP OR WE SEEING THE DECLINE AND THAT WILL ENABLE TO MAKE THOSE JUDGE AS THE YEARS GO ON SO- WHEN IT COMES THAT SPECIFICS OF THOSE POPULATION NUMBERS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER EDWARDS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MAIN FOCUS OF MY PRESENTATION THIS MORNING IS GOING TO BE ON DESCRIBING WHAT WE EXPECT- IN TERMS OF THE PRISON POPULATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AND HOW WE PLAN TO ADJUST OUR PRISON CAPACITY ACCORDINGLY- INCLUDING BY. MEETING THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON PRIVATE CONTRACT PADS HI AND CLOSING A STATE PRISON WAS AND- FIVE YEARS. NOW I THINK THE LA FOR OVER OF KIND OF WHERE WE'VE FROM IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS THAT I THINK PROVIDE SOME IMPORTANT CONTACTS OF JUST HOW FAR WE'VE COME- IT WHEN WE WERE AT OUR PEAK. AT IN TWO THOUSAND SIX OF THE IN MAY PRISON POPULATION WE'RE HOUSING HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND INMATES AT THAT TIME. HI SOME AYE I KNOW SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE HAVE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO PROBABLY HAVE VISITED FIRST HAND AND UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THAT. LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THAT MEANT FOR OUR PRISON OPERATIONS- OTHERS ARE YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN THE PICTURES OF INMATES HOUSED IN TROUBLE BELONGS IN AND GYMNASIUMS IN OUR- STATE INSTITUTIONS- I THINK THAT'S A RATHER DRAMATIC VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF JUST HOW OVERCROWDED. OUR INSTITUTIONS WERE. WHAT'S MAYBE NOT CONVEYED IN THOSE PICTURES IS WHAT THE IMPACT WAS FOR THE APARTMENTS OPERATIONS. I THINK MANAGING A PRISON SYSTEM THAT THAT THAT IS THAT THAT OVERCROWDED- IT REQUIRES SO MUCH OF THE DEPARTMENT'S ATTENTION JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- PRISONS ARE SAFE AND SECURE FOR INMATES AND STAFF. PRESENTS MAJOR CHEN. TO PROVIDING- ADEQUATE CONSTITUTIONAL LEVELS OF HEALTH CARE HI AND FOCUSING ON IN MAY REHABILITATION- SO NOW CONTRACTING TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY- JUST AS OF THIS MORNING WE ARE HOUSING JUST OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND AND MEN'S- IN OUR STATE PRISONS. SO THAT'S A DECLINE OF FIFTY THOUSAND INMATES IN THE LAST. FOURTEEN YEARS OR ALMOST 30% AND WHAT THAT HAS DONE IS REALLY ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO REFOCUS ON ITS CORE MISSION OF PROVIDING REHABILITATIVE SERVICES TO- THE INMATES IN ITS KEREN PREPARING THEM FOR RE ENTRY INTO SOCIETY WHEN THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR SENTENCES. IN A IN ADDITION IT'S ALSO ALLOWED US TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON COSTS THE CONTRACT CAPACITY. AT ITS PEAK WE WERE RELYING ON FOURTEEN THOUSAND CONTRACT BADS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR PRISON POPULATION. THAT INCLUDED TEN THOUSAND INMATES AN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES AND FOUR THOUSAND AND MANSON IN STATE CONTRACT FACILITIES I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT AS OF THIS MORNING WE WERE- DOWN TO. JUST TWENTY THREE HUNDRED INMATES IN CONTRACT- IN CONTRACT BALLOTS. WE WERE AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED WE WERE ABLE TO BRING BACK THE LAST OF OUR INMATES FROM OUT OF STATE- IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO WE WENT FROM TEN THOUSAND WERE DOWN ZERO AND AS MY COLLEAGUE ALSO NOTED WE'VE ALREADY. BEEN ABLE TO PHASE OUT ONE PRIVATE CONTRACT FACILITY IN THE STATE- AS OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN. SO THAT BRINGS US KIND OF WHERE WE STAND TODAY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SIX REMAINING CONTRACTS FACILITIES THAT INCLUDES THREE PRIVATE FACILITIES TO FOR MAN AND ONE FOR WOMEN- WE ALSO HAVE THREE PUBLIC CONTRACT FACILITIES. IN THE STATE WITH A WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH US CITIES AND KERN COUNTY TO OPERATE THOSE FACILITIES. AND AS I SAIDTHE CURRENT POPULATION WITHIN ALL OF THOSE- FACILITIES IS A TOTAL OF JUST OVER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED RIGHT NOW. TO NOW- TURNING TO WHERE WE EXPECT TO BE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WHICH IS I THINK REALLY THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS CONVERSATION TODAY- THAT PREPARED A- VISUAL AID TO. TO HELP YOU FALL ALONG WITH MY COMMENTS. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS SHOULD BE IN FRONT OF YOU WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS REALLY- HIGH LEVEL PLANNING DOCUMENT- THAT WE USE TO HELP US MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH PRISON CAPACITY. TO MANAGE ALL OF THE INMATES IN OUR CARE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP LINE WHICH IS LABELED PROJECTED INMATE POPULATION- THAT IS SHOWING WHAT WE EXPECT THE POPULATION TO BE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE WHERE PROJECT IN DECLINE OF SEVERAL THOUSAND INMATES OVER THIS FORECAST PERIOD. THE NEXT LINE DOWN SHOWS WHAT THE COURT ORDER POPULATION CAP IS AT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT 5% OF DESIGN CAPACITY. AS ELLIE- NOTED THAT EQUATES TO JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND INMATES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HOUSE IN OUR THIRTY FOUR- STATE OPERATED PRISONS. THE FOLLOWING IS. SERIES ROE IS ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE MAKE TO THAT TOP WINE TO REFLECT INMATES WERE HOUSE OUTSIDE OF OUR THIRTY FOUR STATE PRISONS BECAUSE THOSE INMATES DO NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE STATE- POPULATIONS POPULATION CAP. SO ESSENTIALLY WE NEED TO SUBTRACT THEM FROM THAT TOP LINE. SO THIS INCLUDES INMATES HELD IN THE PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC CONTRACT FACILITIES. AS WELL AS INMATES THAT WE HOUSE IN OUR STATE FIRE CANS THAT ASSISTS OUT CAL FIRE AND FIGHTING FIRES ACROSS THE STATE- AS WELL. A AT LEAST FACILITY THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA CITY WHICH IS- ACTUALLY STAFFED BY CDC OUR STAFF BUT- BUT LEASE FROM A PRIVATE COMPANY. SO I TURN TO AT THE BY LINE HERE BUT A- AND LITERALLY- ON THIS CHART- THIS SHOWS WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN THE- PROJECTED INMATE POPULATION- HOUSE IN OUR THIRTY FOUR PRISONS AND WHAT THE POPULATION CAP IS- IT WE OFTEN REFER TO THIS AS OUR BALL FOR. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY WEEKS WE ARE TWENTY THREE ALMOST TWENTY THREE HUNDRED INMATES BELOW THE POPULATION CAP- AND THAT MEANS TECHNICALLY WE COULD ADD ANOTHER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED INMATES TO OUR EXCEEDING THAT THAT FEDERAL COURT ORDER. IN THIS IS REALLY THE KEY VARIABLE THAT WERE MANAGING TO AS WE ADJUST PRISON CAPACITY- FOR CHANGES IN THE OVERALL PRISON POPULATION. SO THE KEY HERE IS REALLY MAINTAINING- THE RIGHT LEVEL OF OFFER AND NOT HAVING IT BE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW- THE REASON WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO LOW IS BECAUSE THAT WE COULD RISK VIOLATING THE COURT ORDER- THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AND WHAT OUR PRISON POPULATION WILL BE WE DO PROJECTIONS IN THOSE- TEND TO BE FAIRLY ACCURATE BUT- IT. IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHO COMES IN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE PRISONS THAT IS THAT- THAT THAT IS BASICALLY DEPENDING ON WHO THE COUNTY SEND US WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE TO TURN THEM AWAY AT THE FRONT DOOR AND SO- EVEN SMALL CHANGES IN COUNTY SENTENCING PRACTICES- SLIDE INTO A IN IT UP TAKEN CRIME RATES OR- AND NOT. JUST POLICY IS THE FROM WHAT D. A.'S COULD RESULT IN IN MANSON WE EXPECT COMING TO STATE PRISON IN THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE FEDERAL COURT POPULATION CAP I'M WHICH CASE THE FEDERAL COURTS WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO JUST START RELEASING IN MEN'S FROM OUR PRESENT. NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO AVOID THAT- AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THAT BUMPER TO ACCOUNT FOR A SORT OF. THE NEXT INCREASE. IN SAN. TO STATE PRESS. ON THE OTHER HAND WE DON'T WANT THAT BY TO BE HIGH IN THE REASON BECAUSE WHEN INCREASE THAT BALL FOR THE WAY WE DO THAT IS BY GENERALLY GOING OUT AND PURCHASING MORE CONTRACT BALANCE IN THOSE BEDS COME IN A SIGNIFICANT COST OF THE STATE'S ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BAD AND SO FOR EVERY AN INCREASE OF ONE HI. DAD IN THE BUFFER WE'RE ESSENTIALLY SPEND THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- AND SO WE WANT TO HONE IN ON A BOAT FOR A LEVEL THAT'S NOT TOO LOW AS TO RAISE OUR RISK OF EXCEEDING THE FEDERAL COURT POPULATION HAPPEN NOT TO HIGHEST SPEC FUNDING AND SISTERLY. SO THERE'S NO MAGIC NOW BUT WILL GENERAL SHOULD FOR. IS ABOUT BUFFER TWO THOUSAND IT'S BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THE- OF CDC OURS POPULATION PROJECTIONS IN THE PAST- IN OUR EXPERIENCE IN THAT AREA- WE HAVE A COMFORT LEVEL THAT THAT WOULD. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ACCOMMODATE ANY UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN THE POPULATION BUT BUT I ALSO- MAKE SURE THAT WERE. EXPENDING STATE FUNDS WISELY AND NOT SPENDING MONEY UNNECESSARILY SO IF YOU'LL TURN TO THE HAND OUT YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR POPULATION BUFFER- OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. IS PRETTY CONSISTENTLY RIGHT AROUND THAT TWO THOUSAND FIVE MARCH THAT WE SHOOT FOR THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE POPULATION IS DECLINING. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE PLANNING TO REDUCE OUR USE OF CONTRACT PADS IN SO THOSE TWO THINGS SORT OF OFFSET EACH OTHER OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE ARE PLANNING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL THERE WE ARE PLANNING TO- OF AND THE USE OF BOTH OF OUR REMAINING PRIVATE CONTRACT BUT FACILITIES FOR MALE INMATES. ONE OF WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE PHASED OUT BY THE END OF THIS MONTH- THE SECOND AND FINAL REMAINING BY PRIVATE CONTRACT. FACILITY FOR MALES WILL BE PHASED OUT BY THE END OF APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY SO JUST IN A COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW IN THEN LOOKING FOR. INTO THE BUDGET. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF TWO OF OUR REMAINING PUBLIC CONTRACT FACILITIES FOR MALES WITHIN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE FINAL PUBLIC CONTRACT FACILITY FROM MALES WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO PHASE OUT. BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO WE'RE ON PACE TO. VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE OUR USE OF CONTRACT PADS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE OF THE BALL FOR GOING OUT ON THE ON A LONGER TIME HORIZON YOU CAN SEE THAT IT STARTS TO GROW AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND BY THE END OF OUR FORECAST PERIOD IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR I REACHES ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED- SO THAT'S WHERE WE GET TO THE POINT HERE WE CAN ACTUALLY CONSIDER- CLOSING A STATE OPERATED FACILITY- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS WE WOULD HAVE TO- WE WOULD LOSE CAPACITY SO THE- THE- COURT ORDER POPULATION CAP WOULD DECLINE IT'S FOR THE AMOUNT OF THAT DECLINE WOULD DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE PRISON. WE DECIDE TO CLUBS- AVERAGE INSTITUTION SIZE IS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED INMATES AND OUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT 5% OF DESIGN CAPACITY THAT EQUATES TO ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE A LOT OF ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED BEDS- TOWARDS OUR POPULATION CAP SO. YOU DO THE KIND BACK ON THE LOOKED OUT. SUBTRACTING THAT THIRTY FIVE ON FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED. WE WOULD BASICALLY ABLE TO THIS PRISON STILL MAY. THAT BUFFER OF TWO. WHICH IS OUR COMFORT LEVEL THAT WE WOULDN'T BE A- AND RISK OF VIOLATING THAT- FEDERAL COURT POPULATION CAP. THIS SO THINK THAT HOPEFULLY GIVES YOU A PER HIGH SUMMARY OF HOW WE APPROACH ADJUSTING OUR PRISON POPULATION- I DO WANT TO CONCLUDE MY REMARKS WITH JUST PROVIDING A- TO KIND OF IMPORTANT COPY OUT STYLE OF THIS DISCUSSION- THE FIRST BEING THAT THESE POPULATION PROJECTIONS ARE- AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED SUBJECT TO THAT SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY- IN THE PAST WE FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY DOES QUITE A GOOD JOB OF PROJECTING THE POPULATION- WHEN THERE ARE NO MAJOR POLICY CHANGES IN OTHER WORDS IF WE'RE JUST LOOK AT THE STATUS QUO THE DEPARTMENT IS QUITE ACCURATE ESTIMATE HOW MANY. INMATES WILL HAVE IN THE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT THE- OF COURSE DOESN'T HAVE A PER BALL. IN IN WALL DOES NOT KNOW WHAT POLICY MIGHT BE COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE- FOR EXAMPLE THERE WILL BE AN INITIATIVE ON THE- AND THAT'S QUALIFIED FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY DOLLARS- WHICH WOULD GENERALLY- INCREASE THE PRISON POPULATION. AND IT. IF THE VOTERS APPROVE THAT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY. CAUSE US TO REVISIT ALL OF THIS- PURGE ALL OF THESE PROJECTIONS AND- OUR ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO DO IN TERMS OF ADJUSTING TO. PRISON POPULATION CAPACITY- AND THEN THE FINAL COPY OUT I WOULD. HI IS JUST THIS IS FOR A SO HIGH ALLOWED TEND TO FOOT SUMMARY OF HOW WE MANAGE OUR PRISON POPULATION. IN THERE REALLY MASKS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY UNDERLYING ALL OF THIS- I THINK. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY HAS TO MANAGE TO DOZENS OF VARIABLES WHEN THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT TYPES OF BEDS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE A SPECIAL TYPES OF BEDS FOR INMATES WITH MEDICAL NEEDS. WE HAVE SPECIAL BEDS FOR INMATES WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WE HAVE. BOB THAT'S FOR FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SECURE FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SECURITY- WE CAN'T HOUSE CERTAIN INMATES IN CERTAIN PRISONS BECAUSE THE REST OF VALLEY FEVER OR ADA ACCESSIBILITY OR GANG CONCERNS- THERE ARE IS THERE ARE JUST. MANY MANY VARIABLES THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO WAY AND THAT'S REALLY A HERCULEAN TASK THAT THEY HAVE TO DO. EVERY DAY IT'S LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PIECE JIGSAW PUZZLE AND SO I THINK AS WE CONSIDER HOW WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS DISCUSSION I HOPE IT'S- NOT LOST ANY OF US JUST HOW COMPLEX THIS. THIS REALLY IS AS AN ISSUE ON. TO ADDRESS SO THAT OFTEN PUT MY REMARKS TO TAKE ANY QUESTION YOU HAVE THE- TIME. POINT I'LL TAKE. WE ARE. THAT OF FOR LOOKS AHEAD AND CALL ROLE PLEASE AN ESTABLISH A CO. MADAM SENATORS MITCHELL HERE NIELSEN. WELL CARRIER. DOLLY HER DAUGHTER. JOE LEYVA MCGUIRE MONNING MORE LUCK. CAN BROAD. A QUORUM COLLEAGUES IN OUR GOAL QUEST TO BE BOTH EFFICIENT AND THOROUGH I'M GOING TO ASK THAT YOU TAKE COPIOUS NOTES- WITH REGARD TO QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND WE'RE GOING TO FIELD QUESTIONS OF ALL THREE PANELS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE THRD PANEL. THANK YOU WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE FIRST PANEL WILL ASK YOU TO PLEASE STAY BECAUSE YOUR QUESTIONS WILL COME LATER ON OF THE A SECOND PANEL JOIN US. SECRETARY DAIS. AS WELL AS- DOCTORS GOT GRAZED DIRECTOR RESEARCH FROM CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. AGAIN THE FOCUS OF THIS PANEL IS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE STATE IS ACHIEVING THE REQUIRED POPULATION REDUCTIONS IN ORDER TO MEET THE GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES GOAL TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES. AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE SECRETARY GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS MORNING. SOME GOOD MORNING CHAIR- WOMAN SENATORS THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TODAY. ALSO THE CONVERSATION THIS MORNING WITH NUMBERS YOU FOR A LOT OF NUMBERS IN THE FIRST PANEL SO BEGIN THERE AND I THINK YOU HEARD POPULATION THIS MORNING. OUR CURRENT POPULATION AS OF THIS MORNING IS A HUNDRED AND REPRESENTS A DECREASE OF ABOUT FORTY TWO THOUSAND AND MAY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. OR OF THE POPULATION QUESTION ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT REDUCTIONS AND PROGRAMS- AND ONE CAN LOOK AT THE STRICTLY FROM THE NUMBERS QUESTION AND I CAN TELL YOU A SECTOR SINCE I'VE BEEN SIT IN THE SEAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO. MOVE BEYOND THINKING ABOUT NUMBER SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WHAT I KNOW WHAT I'VE KNOWN FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS. AS A BEHIND EVERY NUMBERS A PERSON. IT'S A PERSON WITH NEEDS CONCERNS AND FEARS REALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN MYSELF- OTHER THAN I'M JUSTICE INVOLVED BEFORE WITH A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. REDUCE IN OUR PRISON POPUATION IS THE END RESULT OF PROVIDING THE NECESSARY. REHABILITATE REHABILITATE TOOLS AND SKILLS INDIVIDUALS WHO LACK THEM AND IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THAT LACK OF THOSE SKILLS AND ABILITIES. WANT HIM UP IN THIS PRISON SYSTEM THAT I'M OVERSEEING. WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY THIS CHANGE IN NUMBERS THINKING NEEDS TO NEEDS TO CHANGE WITHIN CITY C. R. BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IT HELPS US AND HELPS ME AND THE EMPLOYEES THE CDC ARE. THINK OF INDIVIDUALS BE ON NUMBERS AND- NEEDS. AND I THINK ONCE YOU START THINKING OF INTO WOULD NEED WHAT THAT DOES IT CHANGES THE EMPLOYEES PURPOSE AND WHY THEY CHOSE TO WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. WORKING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS NOT AN EASY TASK. IT'S CHANGED OVER THE YEARS THE DEMANDS THE PRESSURES NOT ONLY FOR THEM PERSONALLY BUT THEIR FAMILIES. AND WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE LINES OF WORKING IN A PRISON AND SERVING TIME IN THE PRISONS THEY BLUR. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS- LIVES START BEGIN TO SHAKE AND REHABILITATION IS AN EFFECTIVE. BUT IF I DON'T CHANGE THE PURPOSE AND FOCUS OF THE REHABILITATION AND THE REASON FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND WHAT THEY DO. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS YOU WON'T HAVE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION YOU WON'T HAVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES YOU WON'T HAVE PRO SOCIAL BEHAVIORS BY THE EMPLOYEES. SO IT IS MY JOB. TO CHANGE THAT ATMOSPHERE TO GIVE THE EMPLOYEES PURPOSE. AND WHAT'S BEING EXPLAINED EARLIER BY THE LA ON OTHERS AND MYSELF TODAY I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOINGAND WHAT I AM DEMANDING OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT WE CHANGE. THE REASON WHY WE EXIST AND THAT'S TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. THE REDUCTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE POSSIBLE IN LARGE PART BY MANY OF THE THINGS YOU JUST HEARD I WON'T GO OVER THEM AGAIN BUT I THINK ONE THING THAT WASN'T DISCUSSED THAT. HAS BEEN ON. THIS MAN AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SECRETARY PENAL CODE ELEVEN SEVENTY D. WHICH WAS RARELY USED IN PRIOR. BY PRIOR SECRETARIES. BUT TO THE ELEVEN SEVENTY PROCESS WHAT IT DOES IS ALLOWS A SECRETARY. AND GIVES VESTED AUTHORITY AND STATUTES. TO REFER CASES TO SENTENCING COURT'S. CONSIDERATION EITHER BECAUSE OF DISCREPANCIES IN THE SENTENCING CHANGES IN THE LAW AND MORE POORLY EXCEPTIONAL BEHAVIOR I HAVE- I HAVE GLADLY SIGNED MANY OF THOSE ELEVEN SEVENTY DIS AND WE HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF YEARS TAKEN OFF SENTENCES BECAUSE OF THAT. AND WHAT THAT DOES FOR NOT ONLY ME AS A SECRETARY BUT THE INDIVIDUALS TO REFER THEM TO ME THEY COME FROM THE PRISON. SO THE PRISON LEADERSHIP THERE FROM THE WHARTON AND THE STAFF THEY RECOGNIZE. EITHER DISCREPANCIES ARE EXCEPTIONAL BEHAVIOR AND THE REFORM TO ME FOR REVIEW. AND I REFER AMOUNTS OF THE COURT BUT THAT DOES THAT PROVIDES HOPE TO THE POPULATION. AND ALSO FORCES STAFF TO RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING BY SEEKING REHABILITATION. ALLOWS ME T REFER THEM BACK I RECEIVED NUMEROUS LETTERS FROM INMATES. I CONTINUED RECEIVED NUMEROUS LETTERS. OUT OF PROCESS ASKING ME DIRECTLY SEND MY CASE TO THE COURT BUT THAT'S NOT THE PROCESS BUT- IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD THE IMAGE ARE AWARE OF IT AND AS A TO THE PRISONS I HEAR FROM THEM ABOUT THAT. BE ON THE CRITICAL ITEMS THAT I'VE LISTENED SPOKEN ABOUT I'D BE REMISS IN MY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE DEDICATED PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO COME IN OUR PRISONS ON A DAILY BASIS. AND GIVE BACK TO OUR POPULATION BY VOLUNTEERING AND FACILITATING. THE PROGRAMS THAT REACH INMATES IN WAY CDC ARE PROBABLY CANNOT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE. INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN IN THE CD OURS. AND NOW CHANGED IN ONE TO COME BACK GIVEN SHOW THAT HOPE IS POSH AND CHAIN POTS. THESE INDIVIDUALS COME IN ON A DAILY BASIS I CALL THEM PARTNERS BUT MORE OF ALL THE CREDIBLE MESSENGERS OF I SAID EARLIER. THESE ARE PEOPLE PART OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS REENTRY PROVIDERS AND VOLUNTEERS OR SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM TODAY. THROUGH THIS POPULATION REDUCTIONS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE OUR USE OF CONTRACT FACILITIES WHICH HAS BEEN EXPLAINED EARLIER. AND I THINK WE HAVE COME TO A POINT CORRECTIONS WE REALIZE. THAT THE DAYS OF OVERCROWDING WERE NOT THE GOOD DAYS OF CORRECTIONS- THERE WAS A DAY WHEN I WAS A DAY TO DAY PRISON OPERATOR AS A CAPTAIN ON THE FACILITY. TRYING TO MANAGE THESE TRIPLE BUNK FACILITIES THAT THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED. OR THE LACK OF REHABILITATIVE RESOURCES WERE NOT THERE AND THEY WERE VERY BASIC. BASIC EDUCATION AND A GOOD PROGRAMS BUT THEY WERE VERY BASIC- THERE WAS A HARD PLACE TO WORK- SO NOW AS I SAID THE SECRETARY. CRAFTING A DIFF NARRATIVE. A DIFFERENT PURPOSE SEEKING FUNDING- CHAMPIONING OUR EFFORTS. THOSE PRISON OP NOW A- WHAT THEY HAVE BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND A DIFFERENT PLACE- TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. ALTHOUGH ALL OF THESE- CONTRACTED FACILITIES THAT I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER- THEY REPRESENT LOCATIONS THAT ARE. YOU KNOW THE STAY ON MY MIND I DO I DO RECOGNIZE THE SOME OF THESE CLOSURES ARE GONNA IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES. AND WE WILL GO INTO IT WE WILL BE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH MANY PEOPLE I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONCERNED ABOUT THEM. AND AS THE TIME COMES WE WILL BE COMMUNICATING WHAT WE CAN DO TO ASSIST WITH SOME OF THOSE CLOSURES AND HELPING THE EMPLOYEES THAT MAY BE DISPLACED. I KNOW THE QUESTION THAT I WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT FACILITATING POPULATION REDUCTION BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO REDUCE OUR POPULATION TO BE BILLETED OF PROGRAMS. AND THAT PROMOTE SUCCESSFUL COMMUTER INTEGRATION WITHOUT THAT PIECE. WE WILL SEE THE SAME OFFENDER OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I WOULD- I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT OUR CHANGE VISION AND MISSION STATEMENT. YOU CAN GO TO I'LL I WON'T BE LABOR BY READING IT HERE. BUT GO TO THE CDC OUR WEB PAGE IT'S RIGHT ON THE BALL THE CLICKER ON IT AND CLICK IT YOU'LL SEE THE NEW VISION AND MISSION STATEMENT. THE SPEAKS ABOUT MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE SEEKING- IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. THAT ESTABLISHES EDUCATION THAT ESTABLISHES SERVICES FOR SUCCESS FOR INTEGRATION. BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VISION AND MISSION. THAT DOES SPEAK OF SAFETY. SAFETY IS STILL PERMANENT A PRISON WITHOUT SAFE ROUTE INSTITUTIONS OF FACILITIES. AFFECT THE REHABILITATION CANNOT HAPPEN SO WE ARE STILL IN THE SAFETY BUSINESS SO LET'S NOT. EVER FORGET THAT I NEED TO REMIND- MY CITIES YOUR STUFF FOR THAT ALSO. THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR MADE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS- AND SUPPORT THIS VISION SUCH AS IMPROVING IN MAY LITERACY EXPANDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR TREATMENT. ESTABLISHING NEW COMMUNITY REENTRY FACILITIES. THE BUDGET WE PROPOSE FOR YOUR APPROVAL THIS YEAR BUILT UPON THOSE INVESTMENTS BY PROVIDING INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. WITH EXPANDED A HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES MODELING NEW YOUTHFUL OFFENDER REHABILITATIVE COMMUNITIES WHICH I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT. EXPANDING VISITATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ESTABLISH A REESTABLISH CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE. THAT ARE VERY VERY CRITICAL TO REHABILITATION. AND ALSO LASTLY IMPROVE IN OUR STAFF CULTURE AND WELLNESS BY TRAINING OUR EMPLOYEES TO ENGAGE THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. BY UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORTING THE REHABILITATIVE NEEDS. IN THE END. IN CD C. R. THIS IS PUBLIC SAFETY IN A CORRECTIONAL SETTING. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITH GROWTH GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SCOTT GRADES ON THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER WE ARE A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN RESEARCH ORGANIZATION BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO- I'VE BEEN ASKED THIS MORNING TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES ON PROVIDING SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PRISON CLOSURES IN OTHER STATES- HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL FOR REFORMS THAT CALIFORNIA MIGHT CONSIDER THAT MAN THAT HAD BEEN INSPIRED PERHAPS BY OTHER STATES- AND ALSO TALK ABOUT A KEY CHALLENGE ON THE HORIZON- WHICH ACTUALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY ALLUDED TO- SO TURNING FIRST TO PRISON CLOSURES AND OTHER STATES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES BASED ON REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS. SUCH AS THE RAND CORPORATION SENTENCING PROJECT IT'S CLEAR THAT ON NET OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CORRECTIONAL BAD BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OVER THE LAST DECADE- A NUMBER OF FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CLOSE WHILE WE ALL TALK ABOUT PRISON CLOSURES IN FACT IT REALLY RARE THAT A LARGE- IS STATE OWNED FACILITY WOULD BE CLOSED WITH OFTEN BEING CLOSED ARE SMALLER MINIMUM MEDIUM TERM FACILITY. ISN'T A LOT OF OTHER STATES ARE PHASING OUT CONTRACTS WITH PRIDE IN PRINT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WORK REALLY CENTERS ARE BEING CLOSE CAMPS ARE BEING CLOSED SO A LOT OF WHAT WE HEAR WHEN WE HEAR PRISON CLOSURES IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE BIG FACILITIES WERE HOPING TO EVENTUALLY GET TO HEARING WELL FOR ME A LOT OF STATES HAVE BEEN DOWNSIZING THE TYPES OF FACILITIES ON THE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN UNDERTAKING FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS- SO DOWNSIZING. FOR A MIX OF REASONS A LOT OF STATES HAVE HAD BUDGET PROBLEMS THEY LOOK FOR SAY LOOK TO THE CA BY IN NAY FIVE THEY CAN SQUEEZE SOME THERE ARE BE THE FALL CRIME RATES THE CAR ARE TRACK HE SAID STAY OF A DAY. THEY HAVE TO. MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TWENTIETH OR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- SO THERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU MAY GET RID OF THE FACILITY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO INCREASE OPERATIONAL FACIL EFFICIENCIES AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALSO BEEN A BIG MOVING ACROSS THE NATION TO CUT TIES- WITH PRIVATE PRISON CONTRACTORS OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEEN AN APPROACH THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR BROWN AS WELL HAVE FAVORED WE ARE ON THAT PATH- I DO PROVIDE YOU WITH A HAND OUT THAT I MAY SPEAK TO FROM TIME TO TIME IT'S A TABLE COMPARING US TO STATES THAT EVERYBODY LIKES TO COMPARE. CALIFORNIA TO NEW YORK AND ACCESS I'M JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING INCARCERATIONS OF ANDY KERR SUBMISSION ARE IN THOSE STATES NEW ACT EVER RE BEEN THE ISN'T BASED SO THEY CO THE TEEN SO. ACTIONAL SAID TO A SIX FIVE HAD BET THAT'S A TABLE SAYS IS CLOSE TO THE STATE RUN PRISON AND PRIVATE PRISON SAN THOUSAND A LOT SO IS JUST A ONE IF THERE'S A LOT OF THE WAY OF GOING ABOUT THANK IS NOT ALL BY BECAUSE HAVEN'T MAY TO CLOSE ONE UR BIG FACILITY WERE ALL TRYING. TO BEEN FOCUSING FIRST ON PRIVATE OUT A STATE THIS. ME IN STATE PRIVATE FACILITIES THEN EVENT HOPE IS WE GET TO THE BIGELOW AS HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO DOWNSIZE CAN BE CON OFFER A CUP REASON ONE THERE'S ALWAYS A CONCERN PUBLIC SECTOR LAW SO IN. WHO IN PRISON FOR SALE ARE OF COURSE GOING TO CONCERN THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOB SO ON MY BEST READING OF THE LITERATURE OUT WHAT'S BEEN PUT OUT ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES TYPICALLY STATES TRY TO AVOID MASS LAYOFFS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY DECIDE- IT'S TIME TO RETIRE- AND THEN THE STATE DOES WHAT IT CAN TO FIND SPOTS FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO STAY ON IN THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM. IN OTHER FACILITIES THAT REMAIN AFTER ONE TWO OR THREE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CLOSED SO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PUBLIC EMPLOYEE CONCERN ABOUT JOB LOSS THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT BUT I IMAGINE CALIFORNIA AND CD WE ARE- IT WOULDN'T BE WHAT IT COULD. DO OR THAT PEOPLE WORK IS THEIR JOB AS A- SINGLE. I'M THERE'S ALL IN A GAME ON IMMEDIATE AS HAS BEEN A TO A LOT THESE PRINT OFF. ARE IN IS THE HAVE A LOT OF A CAN AND I A COPPER TO THE THEIR ROLE A LOT OF THEIR JOB OUT THERE THESE GREAT JOB. HIGH SCHOOL. THANKS INTO THE PAST I'M AS GOV CUOMO AT NEW YORK IS SAID ON SICK IN CAR OF IS NOW AND PROGRAM AND I'M NOT GOING TO RATIONALIZE LOCKING UP PEOPLE AS AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL HE SAID HAS SAID THAT IN RESPONSE TO A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT HIS DESIRE TO KEEP SHRINKING NEW YORK'S PRISON SYSTEM STILL I'VE CALIFORNIA MOVES CLOSER TO CLOSING A STATE RUN PRISON AND ALSO CONTEMPLATES CLOSING THE REMAINING PREFER PRIVATE FACILITIES. YOU DO WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE THAT FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO SEE A SOURCE OF GOOD PAYING JOBS LOST THAT'S NOT A REASON TO KEEP THE FACILITY OPENED BUT IT IS A REASON TO THINK ABOUT IS THERE A WAY TO REPURPOSE THE FACILITY CAN YOU FIND WAYS TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- SO THAT THE TAX LOSSES AND THE JOB LOSSES CAN BE MITIGATED TO SOME EXTENT. OKAY LET ME SWITCH TO ADDITIONAL REFORMS TO HELP FURTHER REDUCE INCARCERATION- WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE FIRST OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN SOME HUGE STEPS THIS LEGISLATURE. PRIOR GOVERNOR IS THE VOTERS WE'VE DONE A LOT TO ADVANCE THE CAR'S RATIONING CALIFORNIA SO- KUDOS TO THE GOLDEN STATE- WE'RE ONE OF THE LEADERS BUT THERE'S MORE THAT CAN BE DONE AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS SO MINUTE THROW OUT THERE THAT KIND OF FIT INTO THAT. GO BIG OR GO HOME CATEGORY ONE IS INSPIRED BY NEW YORK THE OTHERS INSPIRED BY TEXAS- SO THE FIRST THOUGHT SORT OF INSPIRED BY NEW YORK WHICH RECENTLY REPEAL THE ROCKEFELLER DRUG LAWS SO THESE GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES MANDATORY MINIMUM. SENTENCES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND DROVE UP THE PIT THE PRISON POPULATION WITH NO GAINS IN PUBLIC SAFETY RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE SAID WELL. LET'S GO LET'S BACK LET'S JUST GT RID OF IT THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE WE CAN'T LIVE UNDER LAWS THAT WERE PASSED. UNDER BY A PRIOR GENERATIONS SO THIS MAY BE THE TIME FOR ALL YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE VOTERS FOR FOLKS TO START THINKING IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT FURTHER MODIFYING THE THREE STRIKES LAW WE TOOK ON THE THIRD STRIKE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WITH PROP THIRTY SIX. FOR SECOND STRIKERS- FOR EVERYONE WHO GETS A SECOND STRIKE ON FOR A FELONY EUROPE SENTENCES AUTOMATICALLY DOUBLE THE RESEARCH DOES NOT SUPPORT THE CONTENTION LONGER. IS IT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS ATTACK WOULD BE A- SEC. WHAT'S IN IT FOR THE SO CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT ZERO FELONY IF WANT TO CUT IT WITH HE GOT MANY NOT IN THAT CAT LET'S JUST GIVE ME THE SAN THAT'S ON THE SINCE OF DOUBLE YOUR SET KEEP YOU IN PRESENT FOR MUCH OF THAN IN TO BE RE GOING VERY WOULD BE CALLING FOR A FULL SCALE REPEAL OF THREE STRIKES WHO KNOWS IF THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE READY FOR THAT OR IF THIS LEGISLATURE IS READY FOR THAT BUT THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE GENERATIONAL SHIFT THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE PROBABLY HAPPENING WITHIN A FEW YEARS- SECONDLY- WE NEED TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL IT LESS. IT IS SHOCKING WE HAVE OVER THE SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE ALMOST TEN STATE PRISONERS ARE RECIEVING MENTAL HEALTH THREE AT A CALL AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THROUGH THE CDC ARE THAT'S FOR ONE FIFTH OF HEALTH RELATED SPENDING THROUGH THE CD THE ARE FOR STATE PRISONERS WORST THING OVER WITH WHEN. HELPED OUT MENTAL SERVICE FOR PEOPLE IN STATE PRISON STATE PRISONS ARE SPECTACULARLY INAPPROPRIATE PLACES FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS TO BE OURS SO WE'VE MADE SOME GAINS IN CALIFORNIA THE GOVERNOR OBVIOUSLY DEVOTED HIS STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH YESTERDAY TOO CONCERNED ABOUT HOMELESSNESS IN THE LINKS TO MENTAL ILLNESS THOSE LINKS ARE ALSO PRESENT A PRESENT IN OUR IN THE WAY THAT WE INCARCERATING CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO START ASKING OURSELVES HARD QUESTIONS IS THIS THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO BE ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS CAN WE DO OR IN. MORE RE THAT THE END I PREVENT THE KEY PEOPLE WITH ALMOST GET IN BOB IN THE THIS IS THE FIRST PART THIS IN. IS BECAUSE PUBLIC I'D LIKE BUT YOU'RE AND REPUBLICAN GO IN THAT SEVEN TO. THE WAS GOING TO THE FOR PLACE THEY LOOKED FOR REFORM O STOP CYCLING PEOPLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH THEIR PRISON SYSTEM THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES THEY LOOKED FOR SOLUTIONS TO THEIR- BALDING. PRISONS THEY HAVEN'T MADE IT AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA THEY HAVEN'T ADOPTED AS MANY REFORMS AS WE HAVE SO THEIR PRISON POPULATION HASN'T COME DOWN MUCH BUT IT'S COME DOWN BY ABOUT. TEN PERCENT. SO FOR. THIS THAT. FINAL THOUGHT HERE CHALLENGES ON THE HORIZON AS THOMAS JEFFERSON SAID IN THE SMASH HIT HAMILTON EVERY ACTION HAS ITS EQUAL OPPOSITE REACTION- WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING THIS ON THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY BALLOT. I'M GOING TO BE IT'S SORT OF A TEST OF CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIANS COMMITMENT TO THE CONCEPT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND WHETHER WE AS A STATE ARE WILLING TO STAY THE COURSE OR IF WE'RE GONNA START NIBBLING AWAY AT THE GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THIS LEGISLATURE. AND THE VOTERS THEMSELVES RECENT YEARS THERE'S OPERA PROPOSAL TO REPEAL BAIL REFORM THAT GUY THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SIGNED A LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN. THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE A PROPOSAL TO CHIP AWAY AT PROP FORTY SEVEN AND PROP FIFTY SEVEN IN A WAY THAT WOULD DRIVE UP STATE AND LOCAL CORRECTIONAL SPENDING. AND ALSO SLOW THE STATE'S MOMENT COME IN REDUCING THE PRISON POPULATION THE NUMBER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST SHOWED YOU FOR THEIR PROJECTIONS OF THE PRISON POPULATION FIVE YEARS FROM NOW ASSUME CURRENT LAW THE STATUS QUO. OKAY THAT'S GREAT BUT WHAT IF THE STATUS QUO CHANGES THAT MEANS YOU HAVE- PROBABLY ELIMINATED YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE THE STATE PRISON IN FIVE YEARS SO IT'S REALLY SOMETHING. TO KEEP IN MIND- AS WE DEBATE THIS IT HASN'T GONE ON THE BALLOT YET BUT THIS MEASURE HAS QUALIFIED AND I WOULD ASSUME IT'S VERY LIKELY TO BE PLACED ON THE BALLOT BY THIS I THINK IT'S A JUNE DEADLINE. SO THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND NOT NECESSARILY ANYTHING THIS LEGISLATURE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT- BUT IT IT'S GOING TO BE A TEST OF CALIFORNIA COMMIT. TO WE'RE WILLING TO STAY THE COURSE ON THAT CRIMINAL. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM CHOICES WE'VE BEEN MAKING THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE THANK THE SET TERRY AND DOCTOR GRAY FORD. CONTEST AND WE'RE GONNA. ASK THE FINAL PANEL TO COME FORWARD FAST YOU TWO GENTLEMEN TO PLEASE STICK AROUND BECAUSE I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. THE THIRD PALATABLE TRANSITIONAL IMPULSE RELIEF SERVICES PANEL. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM- ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND HOW THE STATE CAN PLAY A ROLE IN ENSURING ITS SUCCESS. ONE WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM MR WORTLEY FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ON COMMON LAW FOLLOWED BY THE BOND AND- SALE JOHNSON BOTH WITH THE AMITY FOUNDATION WELCOMES TO OUTLAY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR AWARD FROM IRVINE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATE MITCHELL- GOOD MORNING SENATOR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- JUST ADAM KEEP WIDELY FROM ON COMMON LAW WHAT WE DO IS WE PROVIDE. TRAUMA INFORMED COUNSELING AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES AND- I THINK THE NUMBER MAY BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER BUT- I. HAS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES. THE NUMBER NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW- I WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY BECAUSE- I THINK THAT WE AS A SOCIETY WE WE'VE INVENTED INVENTED MANY WAYS TO- DEHUMANIZE PEOPLE AS WE- PROSECUTE AND CONVICT AND SENTENCE THEM TO PRISON. WE SENT THEM TO LONGER TERMS AT YOUNGER AGES AT THINK IT'S WELL PAST TIME WE FIND SOME SAFE PATHWAYS TO BRING THEM BACK HOME. THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS TO CLOSE A PRISON AND IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OR SO AND I THINK THAT'S AN ATTAINABLE. GOAL IN A REASONABLE- STEP BUT- I ALSO THINK THAT. WE GET THERE BY BY SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE. MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE IN PRISON AND MORE RESPONSIVE TO SURVIVORS OF CRIME OPTICALLY VIOLENT CRIME BUT CRIMES IN GENERAL I THINK WE GET THERE BY TRANSFORMING THE VERY CULTURE INSIDE OF INSTITUTIONS I APPRECIATE SECRETARY D. AS IS- COMMITMENT IN HIS HIS VISION- AND WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE I THINK WE AGREE ON A LOT OF THINGS. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT AS THIS COMMITTEE IS AWARE THE COST OF PRISON. ISN'T IN IS- REALLY CONTINUES TO SOAR EVEN THOUGH. THE POPULATION. IS REDUCE COSTS SERVE OUR CREDIT WE HIGH AND I THINK. THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ARE. OLDER SICKER. AND THEY HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEN CAN ACTUALLY BE MET IN A PRISON SETTING. MY OBSERVATIONS ARE GOING TO FALL INTO THE REALLY THREE BROAD CATEGORIES TODAY- ONE IS ABOUT. OF THE NEED FOR MORE RESPONSIVE PROGRAMMING INSIDE THE PRISONS- ANOTHER CATEGORIES IT IS THE NEED FOR CULTURAL CULTURAL CHANGE WITHIN THE PRISONS. AND BLAST CATEGORIES ABOUT THE MEANING THE NEED FOR MEANING FULL OF SUPPORT UPON RE ENTRY PANEL THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THIS PANEL BUT- YOU CAN'T REALLY TAKE ONE PIECE AND NOT NOT TIED TO THE REST BECAUSE IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME. PROCESS AND SYSTEM- AND AS- AS A GOOD IDEAS NOTED WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE NOT NUMBERS. AND PEOPLE LIVE IN EVERY EVERY PHASE OF THIS PROCESS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. AS FOR MORE RESPONSIVE PROGRAMMING. OF THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS ARE SURVIVORS OF PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. ESTIMATES RANGE FROM 6270% OF. THOSE WHO IDENTIFY AS MALE AND AND EVEN HIGHER RATES AMONG TRANSGENDER POPULATION- ARE SURVIVORS OF PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL TRAUMA. AND RESPONDING TO TRAUMA WITH PUNISHMENT IS PROVEN ITSELF TO BE ONE OF THE LEAST EFFECTIVE- MOST HARMFUL AND EXPENSE OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. AND SO- IT'S NOT JUST THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN PRISON IT'S THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES SO- WE URGE A HEALING APPROACH. INSTEAD I THINK THIS STARTS WITH SCREENING PEOPLE WHEN THEY FIRST COME INTO PRISON- TO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPES OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND TRAUMA THEY'VE HAD IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE DO RIGHT NOW- AND THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY. SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT HELP ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. CURRENTLY THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO PRISON PROGRAMMING FALL FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES- WHICH CAN USUALLY BE TRACED BACK TO AN ORIGINAL TRAUMA BURIED BENEATH. DECADES OF PROTECTIVE LAYERS THAT PEOPLE CREATE TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE. I THINK THE PROBOARDS IS BY RECOGNIZING THE BENEFITS OF HAVING PEOPLE DO THIS DEEP INTROSPECTIVE WORK. ALTHOUGH I DON'T AGREE THAT THE FAILURE TO DO THIS WORK CORRELATES TO RISK OF VIOLENCE. NEVERTHELESS I THINK THE PROBLEM REALLY IS THAT WHILE. PROBOARDS GRANTING PAROLE TO PEOPLE WHO'VE DONE THIS WORK THERE TOO FEW PROGRAMS AND TOO FEW SAFE SPACES WITHIN THE PRESENCE ACTUALLY DO THE WORK. AS FOR THE CULTURE CHANGE WITHIN THE PRISONS I- AS I SAID I DO COMMEND SECRETARY D. AS FOR HIS VISION OF A NEW CULTURE INSIDE AND IT ESPECIALLY IS RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE. OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND REALLY TRANSFORMING- WHAT AND WHAT SAFETY LOOKS LIKE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE PRESIDING THE COMMUNITY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY- I THINK WE HAVE TO REJECT THE CONCEPT OF US VERSUS THEM. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH WERE US IN THEM. AND THAT'S TRUE WITHIN THE PRISONS AND WITHIN THE LARGER SOCIETY AT THING THAT WE CREATE A US A SAFER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE SOCIETY WHEN WE COME CLOSER TOGETHER RATHER THAN MORE DISTANT AND ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER AND I THINK PRISON OFFICIALS. ALSO REALIZE JUST HOW DAMAGING PRISON IS FOR THOSE WHO WORK THERE. ASIDE FROM VIOLENCE AND SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THEIR STAFF OF SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF DEPRESSION SUICIDE POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES OF ANY PROFESSION. A PRISON IS SIMPLY A BAD PLACE FOR EVERYBODY. BUT PEOPLE WHO WHO DO FIND A COMMUNITY INSIDE PRISON WHERE THEY CAN PROCESS TRAUMA ARE MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD. AND THOSE WERE RELEASED THROUGH THE PRO WAR TO MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL AFTER THE RELEASE. AND THE COST SAVINGS ARE HUGE- IN IN OUR ORGANIZATION WE'VE NOW SEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR OF OUR- LICENSE CLIENTS RELEASED. AND EVERY YEAR THEY STAY OUT OF PRISON SAVE THE STATE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. JUST THOSE TWO AND FORTY FOUR. IF WE JUST THINK THIS DEMONSTRATED INVESTING AND COUNSELING AND- IN THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT THE PEOPLE NEED TRANSLATES INTO GREATER SAFETY WITHIN THE PRISONS AND OUTSIDE IN THE COMMUNITY- THE CATEGORY OF THIS MEANINGFUL SUPPORT UPON RE ENTRY. IS A HUGE ONE AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SOME EXPERTS ON THAT IN A MINUTE. I'M A TALK FROM ABOUT TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SPECIFICALLY- TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS HALFWAY HOUSES- THEY CAN BE HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE RETURNING FROM PRISON ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING LONG LONG TERMS IN PRISON CLING LICENSES- HOWEVER THE FACILITIES THAT ARE OPERATED BY FOR PROFIT COMPANIES. TO FOCUS ON ON RESTRICTION AND PUNISHMENT TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON MEASURING RECIDIVISM WE ACTUALLY THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON- COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT WE THINK RECIDIVISM ITSELF IS REALLY A POOR MEASURE OF- OF SUCCESS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT WHAT SOMEONE'S LIFE LOOKS LIKE ON THE OUTSIDE. MOST OF US ARE WE ON OUR WAY BACK TO PRISON. DOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT WHAT OUR LIVES LIKE. THAT'S TRUE EVERYONE ELSE IN THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANNA- REFERENCE I'D I SHARED A LETTER- WITH THE COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT THAT- SUMMARIZE SOME FINDINGS FROM A REPORT THAT WE COMMISSION LAST YEAR- FROM THE GOLDMAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY AT UC BERKELEY- WE WERE WE WERE CONCERNED BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS ABOUT. CHALLENGES THEY HAD AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES MANY OF THEM REALLY BAD AND DISTURBING CONCERNING WHO WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT SO WE ASK THE FOLKS AT THE AT THE GRADUATE SCHOOL THERE- SOME SOME GREAT STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROGRAM- THIS PROJECT INTO THE LETTER HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THOSE THINGS AND SOME OF THOSE KEY FINDINGS FROM THE REPORT. INCLUDE THAT. WHAT HAPPENS A WHAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT THERE'S THIS CONTINUED- OFFICES ON RECIDIVISM AS THE KEY INDICATOR OF RE ENTRY AND PAROLE SUCCESS. AND THAT CONTRIBUTES TO PROGRAM ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE BASICALLY LIKE PRISONS MMHM- THEY'RE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL A LOT OF A LOT OF WAS FURTHER ISOLATING PEOPLE FROM THE VERY SOCIAL STRUCTURES THAT THE THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THEIR FULL REINTEGRATION. THIS INCLUDES BEING REGULARLY CALLED BY THE CDC NUMBERS INSTEAD OF THE NAMES INCLUDES IN DURING PRISON LIKE DRILLS SUCH AS SURPRISE COUNT TIME AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. I HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE SOMETIMES THEY'RE GOING. BEING FORCED TO SIT THROUGH HOURS OF IRRELEVANT PROGRAMMING. IT INTERFERES WITH MORE MEANINGFUL AND PRODUCTIVE- ACTIVITIES SUCH AS AN EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO INCLUDES A PATRONIZING AND PATERNALISTIC WAY OF CONTROLLING RESIDENTS MONEY. WITHOUT TEACHING THEM ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL LITERACY SKILLS OR IMPOSING A REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRAVEL AND THE TIME WITH THE FAMILY ALL THESE THINGS OF BARRIERS TO SOMEONE FULLY REINTEGRATE AND FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE COMMUNITY ANOTHER FINDING WAS THAT- WHILE THEY'RE THERE CONSIDERABLE CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE HAVING CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE FOR PROFIT COMPANIES. LIKE THE GEO GROUP. OTHER TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES. THAT DON'T RECEIVE STATE FUNDING. HAVE VIRTUALLY NO OVERSIGHT. NO REGULATION WE DON'T ATUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY DO- AND THEIR PRACTICES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND THAT THAT REPRESENTS A OF A LOT OF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THERE THE FUNDED BY. I WOULD FOUNDATIONS OR JUST OF- THEY FOUND FIND OF INDIVIDUAL DONORS TO SUPPORT THEIR WORK. AND THEY JUST SORT OF CREATE A PROGRAM THAT THEY ONCE WE HAVE BEEN A NONPROFIT I SUPPORT- BEING CREATIVE IN FINDING WAYS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE. BUT WHEN PEOPLE RUN THEM LIKE PRISONS I DON'T SUPPORT THAT. AND I THINK IT'S CONTRARY TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN THESE THESE PROGRAMS. SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT REPORT. A FOCUS ON TRANSITIONAL PROGRAMS. THEY INCLUDE HEY FOCUSING AS MUCH OR MORE ON THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THE- AS COMPARED TO SIMPLY HOUSING PEOPLE AND ALSO. CREATING SOME CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE DEFINITION OF WHAT SUCCESS EVEN MEANS AFTER PRESIDENT- IT CAN'T JUST BE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ACTORS RIGHT- IT CAN'T JUST BE THAT- WE THINK THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF BETTER DESCRIBE THE QUALITY OF SOMEONE'S LIFE AND THEIR ABILITY TO FULLY PARTICIPATE AS FULL CITIZENS IN SOCIETY- REMOVING BARRIERS TO HOUSING EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION THAT THE THAT ALSO INTERFERE WITH. FULL INTEGRATION. I HAVE THE TO SAY WITH THE MISFITS IT'S REALLY MEANINGFUL TO BE SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- OF THE HOTEL JOHNSON WHO YOU HEAR FROM IN A MINUTE WAS A CLIENT OF MINE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO. AT THE TIME HE HAD BEEN GRANTED PAROLE BY THE PAROLE BOARD. AND THE GOVERNOR REVERSED. AND WE HAD TO GO TO COURT. TO FIGHT THAT DECISION. AND WE LOST. AND THIS IS A PART OF A WHOLE SERIES OF PETITIONS THAT WE FILED TO CONVINCE THE STATE TO LET HIM GO AT THE TIME THE- THE GOVERNOR WAS NOT INTERESTED AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO SHOW TO SHOW. WHO THEY WERE THEY'VE THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE CRIME ITSELF AND NOT A LOT OF APPRECIATION FOR THE CAPACITY TO CHANGE- SO IT'S A PRIVILEGE REALLY AN HONOR TO BE SITTING WITH THOSE OUT NOW. NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE'S HOME WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE. UP BUT BECAUSE- IF HE'S RUNNING A PROGRAM IN WHICH TWO OF MY OTHER CLIENTS NOW. RESIDE TALK ABOUT FULL CIRCLE. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW THE MAN IT DID YOU YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY. HE WAS THAT GUY TEN YEARS AGO. AND WE AS A STATE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIS CAPACITY TO CHANGE AND WHO WE WAS FOR THE PEOPLE IN IN PRISON AND IN THE COMMUNITY- I'M I'M REALLY GLAD THAT THAT'S CHANGED WITH THEIR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. BEHIND HIM WHO WERE IN THE SAME SITUATION AND SO I APPRECIATE THIS THIS INTEREST IN FINDING MORE PATHWAYS FOR THESE FOLKS COME HOME BECAUSE OF THE CONTRIBUTION THEY MAKE WHEN THEY GET HERE- I THINK THAT THE- ALL ALL THIS REALLY IS TO SAY THAT. I THINK COMPREHENSIVE- A COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. DURING AND AFTER KERR SERRATION ARE KEY TO FINDING WAYS TO REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION I THINK WE HAVE SOME MODELS THAT THAT- WORK I THINK THEY RELY ON CONTINUING THE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE START INSIDE ONCE THEY COME HOME DON'T JUST LEAVE THEM HANGING- YEP YEP TO START PROGRAMS EARLY ENOUGH WHILE PEOPLE INSIDE CONTINUE TO THEM LONG ENOUGH AFTER OUTSIDE THAT INCLUDES THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THEY NEED COUNTING WHEN THEY COME HOME- CAUSES A TRAUMA THAT THE EXPERT. CHAPLAIN AT LESSONS THE TRAUMA OF BEING IMPRISONED THE TRAUMA OF COMING OUT. WE DON'T RECOVERY THAT AND SO I THINK THERE'S A GREAT NEED AND PEOPLE LIKE THOSE LA LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEST SUITED INVEST KILL TO HELP THAT TRANSITION IT'S WHO IS WHAT HE WHAT HE DOES SO I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- COMMITMENT TO AFFECT MEANINGFUL CHANGE THE SYSTEM THAT IS. NEGATIVELY IMPACT IMPACTED THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK INSIDE PRISONS AND YOU KNOW I'LL JUST CALL THE MEASURE EARLIER. SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE IN A RECENT. STUDIES INDICATE THAT MOST SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE MOST SURVIVORS OF CRIME PER FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION WHEN GIVEN THE OPTION. ESPECIALLY THAT OPTION LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING LIKE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE- PROBLEM IS THE NOT GIVEN AN OPTION. IT'S PRISON OR NOTHING- AND MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T USE THAT SEPARATE SHOULD THIS OPPORTUNITY I GET REALLY NOT A TO BE HERE WITH THE MISTER BOND MISTER JOHNSON THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH WHAT WE PROTECT YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM- DOUG BOND FOLLOWED BY MISTER JOHNSON THANK YOU FOR COMING TO BOND WITH THE AMITY FOUNDATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AGAIN- DOUG BONHAM CO FOR AMITY FOUNDATION- TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MD DATE FOUNDATION LONG BEFORE I WAS CO FAMILY FOUNDATION. I WAS A FOSTER CHILD TO INCARCERATED PARENTS- THE FOUNDERS OF THIS ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY GOT ME OUT OF FOSTER CARE AFTER BEING IN OVER A DOZEN FOSTER HOMES THAT INTERVENTION HELPED CHANGE MY LIFE IN THIS KIND OF THE PASSION FOR WHY DO THIS TODAY. I HAD A NOT BELIEVED IN A SINGLE FATHER COMING OUT OF PRISON THE COULDN'T READ OR WRITE AND HAD BEEN IMPRISONED SUMMERTIME'S GETTING CUSTODY OF HIS CHILD MYSELF FROM MY SISTER WOULDN'T BE. REUNITED WITH HER FAMILY MY MOTHER THEN GOT OUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX HELP START THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY WITH- THOSE ALL. AT OUR DONOVAN IN NINETEEN NINETY AND HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE THROUGH THAT PATHWAY FAMILY FOUNDATION AND AMITY FOUNDATION- WHEN I CAME WAS SERVING UNDER PEOPLE WERE SMALL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION WERE NOW IN OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND HAVE SIX HUNDRED EMPLOYEES MANY OF WHOM HAVE. PACKED BY THE SYSTEM. MEMOS ON EXPANDING PROGRAMS LIKE SPECIALIZED TREATMENT OPTIMIZE PROGRAMMING WHICH IS CALLED STOP THE CDC ARE FUNDED PROGRAM- THE MEN'S COMMUNITY RANGER PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO COME HOME THE LAST YEAR BEFORE THEIR SENS WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF VERY GOOD SUCCESS WITH THAT. AND THEN ALSO TOOL FOR NONPROFITS LIKE AMITY FOUNDATION A REVOLVING FUND THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO HELP OBTAIN PROPERTIES- AND WERE REALLY BOLD INTO A LOT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY HUNTERS RIGHT NOW POLICE IN THOSE PROPERTIES DOESN'T REALLY HELP TO. NONPROFITS IN TERMS OF STRENGTH IN BEING ABLE TO PAY OUR STAFF AND HAVE ASSETS AS AN ORGANIZATION- BUT THE REPAIR WORK IS WHERE- CELLS THAT AND OTHER STUDENTS SO I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT- COLLABORATION IS RALPH MENTIONED THIS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT CDC ARE VISITED NINE PRESENCE OVER THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF- WE OPERATE IN EIGHTEEN INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SIX COUNTY JAILS. ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT BEDS AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS AND IT TRULY DOES HAVE TO BE A COLLABORATION WITH CITIES HERE ARE TEN YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE BEEN WELCOME THEN THE WAY WERE BEING WELCOME TODAY TO THE INSTITUTIONS EGGMAN CORRECTION FOR THEIR- THEIR CHANGE THE- FOR THE DIRECT THAT WE'RE GOING ON WE- HAVE A LOT OF GROUND STILL A LOT TO BE DONE. AND THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE THIS ISN'T SIMPLY JUST DOING ONE SERVICE AND THAT ONE SERVICE IT'S GOING TO HELP. EVERYTHING THERE IS A LOT. MINISH SEE NO OF HOUSE ISSUE. AND THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT WE WERE ON WE CLASS ORGAN AND WE THE WITHOUT MANY GROUP LIKE HE SAID OTHERS WE COULDN'T DO WHAT WE DO AND SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THAT ONE INTERVENTION IS GONNA CHANGE EVERYTHING IS VERY FULL AND QUITE FRANKLY- WE COORDINATE WITH SO MANY AMAZING ORGANIZATIONS SO MANY COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS THAT REALLY HELP COLLECTIVELY HELP BRING PEOPLE HOME SO. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU TO TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ROLES A COLLABORATION AND HOW THAT'S DONE IN THE COMMUNITY AND HOW THAT ACTUALLY GET A RE. LIKE HE'S GROUP- AND OTHERS REALLY- ESSENTIAL FOR WHAT WE DO REALLY GIVING HOPE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT. DON'T HAVE A LOT OF HOPE IN THE INSTITUTION MAKING SURE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT. THAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND INMATES HAVE- FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE IMPACT ON THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME. SOME OF THE BARRIERS FOR US WITH HOUSING IN IS A LOT A LOT OF PERMANENT HOUSING. SITES REALLY ALLOW OUR PLACEMENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN TO GO INTO APARTMENTS THAT DEFINITION HOMELESSNESS. IS WORKING AGAINST US IN TERMS OF SOMEBODY COMING HOME I'M NOT GOING TO PUT SOMEBODY ON THE STREETS TO THAT FOR THEM TO SAY THEY'RE HOMELESS. JUST TO GET INTO HOUSING AND RISKS THAT- SO WHAT THE STATE IS DONE WITH THE BBC'S GRANT. TO A LOT I'LL PAY SUBSIDIES A RENTAL SUBSIDIES IS DEFINITELY IMPORTANT EXPANDING ON PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. IS ESSENTIAL- REALLY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT CAN REDUCES BARRIERS. I THINK IS VERY ESSENTIAL FOR US- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AFTER CARE IF WE TALK ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN A PRISON WE HAVE TO HAVE ALTERNATIVES YOU CAN SIMPLY JUST. SHUT DOWN IMPRISONING PEOPLE TO COME OFF ON A BUS AND GREYHOUND AND LAND IN LA- AND IT UP IN SKID ROW SO WE HAVE TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS DEVELOPING. CAPACITY IT TAKES ANYWHERE FROM A YEAR TO TWO YEARS TO GET IT THIS CAN GO ON. OUR RESIDENTS SO THERE LAW HOLD TIMES CON. BUT HERE'S A AND OTHER BARRIERS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH BEFORE WE CAN ACTUALLY GET ONTO CAMPUS. I GO. YEAH SIR THINGS THAT CAN. DID YOU YES AND WITH THE CORRECTIONS. TO STRING THAT PROCESS IF YOU. HELPERS TO HIGH FORMALLY IN CAR. MEN WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN IN. YOU WILL SEE A- WHEN YOU ASK FOR THAT VETERAN YOU SEE RESPONSE. AND SO WE WOULD HAVE TO ENCOURAGE THOSE KIND OF- REQUIREMENTS OR INCENTIVES. FOR INDIVIDUALS WERE BUILDING FIVE HUNDRED UNITS PERMANENT SPORT OF HOUSING BECAUSE IF WE DEVELOP IT THEY CAN'T SAY NO. QUITE FRANKLY TO THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT ARE COMING OUT THAT ARE IN OUR PROGRAMS. SO HAVING THOSE INCENTIVES IN PLACE- IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL AND HAVING DEVELOPERS ACTUALLY WILL TRY TO SKIP A ROOF. SS PEOPLE AND NOT ASSESS PEOPLE OUT THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY. BETTER LEVERAGING A PROGRAMS IS CERTAINLY SO STATE FUNDS CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT ARE TRANSITION NATURE. MAKE THE- LEVER WITH RESOURCE FROM THE- FROM THE COUNTY. AND THE PROVIDERS LIKE. ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT- WHAT LEVERAGE RESOURCES ARE WE LOOK UTILIZING. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR WITH WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARDS- THOSE ARE ALL VERY ESSENTIAL FOR US SOME OF THE POLICIES RECENTLY. ARE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT AGAIN ONE SIZE FITS ALL SO WE'RE HOUSING FOR PROVIDERS WELL- WE DO. A SERVICES FOR VIGILS THERE SIR MENTAL ILL CYCLING NOW TO QUE JAIL. THOSE PROGRAMS LOOK VERY DIFFERENT THAN ON LAW FOR PROGRAM. AND PEOPLE COME IN HOW AFTER THE YEARS THE CARS SOME OF THE HOUSING FIRST CHALLENGES FOR EVERYTHING THAT STATE FUNDED NOW WHILE WE SUPPORT THAT. WOULD PUT BARRIERS IN FRONT OF PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONE THAT DOES WENT THROUGH AND LIKE THE ONES THAT PEOPLE COMING OUT FOR LIFE SENTENCES OR SO JUST BE MINDFUL THAT IT'S AND WELL INTENTIONED- BUT ON THE GROUND AND GET. THESE FACILITIES UP AN OPERATING CREATE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS. SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S TIME TO LISTEN TO THIS APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT. AND THANK YOU. VERY MUCH- MISTER JOHNSON WE'RE LOOKING TO BRING IT HOME. HE MY NAME IS THOUGH JOHNSON AND THANK YOU MISTER WHY AND MISTER MOM. THEY NOW CONSUMERS MIGHT. I'VE BEEN WITH WHILE NINE NOW.

THE TO SEE BUT THE- IF YOU WOULD LIKE I APPRECIATE THAT THE SO. WILL ON THAT FROM YOU MESSAGE. AND WILL MAKE SURE BECOME MEMBER. IT THANK YOU. YEAH BUT THANK YOU. AB I'VE GOT ONE QUESTION AND THEN GOING TO PAY THE TWO COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR THROUGH THE NIELS AND THEN I SOME SKIN. SENATOR MORE LAW. SENATOR. THAT TEN THIRTY BILL THANK YOU. A AS A FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE WE HAD A COMMITTEE HEARING JUST THIS WEEK ON CLIMATE CHANGE WHERE WE WERE IT HEARD A VARIETY PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS ALL OF US ATTENDED THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS YESTERDAY WHERE THE GOVERNOR FOCUSED ON ANOTHER INQUIRES- INVESTMENTS AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE VERY TOUGH DECISIONS AROUND INVESTMENTS ON BEHALF OF. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. AND I THOUGHT OF THAT AS I LIST TODAY'S. IT'S ONE QUESTION I HAVE BECAUSE I DO SHARE IN- SECRETARY DHEAS IS COM AT AS WELL AS I THINK A COMMENT MADE ALSO BY MISTER WHAT LEE AND THAT IS A GOOD KNOWLEDGE IN THE HEALTH WELL BEING AND SAFETY. OF ALL THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IMPRISONED BEAT IN MAJOR PERSONNEL. WE HAVE CLOSE STATE FACILITIES ARE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET OF THE BUDGET PROCESS WE HAVE OVERSEEING THE CLOSURE OF- DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS FACILITIES IN NAPA AND SEVEN CALIFORNIA AND SO WE KNOW WHAT THAT. EXPERIENCE CAN BE LIKE IT-LOOKS LIKE. I ALSO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE EVEN THOUGH THE FOCUS THANKS TO THE COURT ORDER IS REDUCING THE POPULATION WE ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH WELL BEING AND SAFETY OF THOSE WHO ARE STILL INCARCERATED. AND THESE MANY THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE QUITE OLD- BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION IN OUR WAYS OF SURVIVING- WHEN BUDGETS WERE WERE LESS THAN HALF WHAT TODAY'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS WAS A REDUCTION IN FUNDING AROUND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SPECIAL REPAIRS. I REMEMBER HEARING THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE HAD TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT. A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR BOILER. IN A FIFTH THAT WAS FOR CLOSE. BUT AGAIN WE HAVE A RISK. FOR MAINTAINING THEM TODAY. SO IF YOU COULD TALK TO US VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE ACCUMULATED. BACK LOG OF SPECIAL REPAIRS AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS BECAUSE- AS WE TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE FUNDING RESPONSIBILITIES- I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT YOU THINK THE OVERALL PRICE TAG IS. BOMB FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE FACILITIES WHILE THEY'RE OPEN AND PEOPLE ARE THERE. OUR HUMANE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. BUT NO SECRETARY DAIS AT THAT'S BEST COMING FROM YOU FINANCE WHOEVER. CAN REPLY AT APPRECIATED FOR MY- SURE MY FRIENDS AND FINANCE BY MISS STATE OR NOT EXPOUNDING LIKE I SHOULD THEY'LL JUMP IN AND I KNOW I HAVE SOME REAL SMART PEOPLE FROM OUR FACILITIES DIVISION OUT THERE BUT- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE ENDEAVOR TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR TWELVE OLDEST PRESENCE AND- THAT'S WHAT TROUBLE THIS PRISONS RANGING FROM YEARS BILL FROM. EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO TO NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE LONG TIME AGO. THANK AND- A TO THE LASSEN BILL TO NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. AND WE HAVE GOTTEN SOME- VOLUMES BACK ON THAT REPORT AND JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE ELEVEN SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE INITIAL NUMBERS TO BRING THOSE UP TO. A CURRENT INDUSTRY STANDARDS IS ABOUT OVER ELEVEN BILLION THAT'S JUST FOR THOSE. BEYOND THAT- WE HAVE ROOF REPAIRS WE HAVE- REPAIRS AND WE'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BRINGING OUR FACILITIES UP TO HEALTHCARE STANDARDS. ONE OF THE ITEMS ON THE BUDGET IT'S A REQUEST FOR- OUR FACILITY IN NORCO CRC. AND THAT IS TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH CARE FACILITY TO BRING UP- THE FLOORING IN THE COUNTER SPACE UP TO MEDICAL STANDARDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH TITLE TWENTY TWO BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID SENATOR. THESE ARE PEOPLE PROVIDED SERVICES FORM. WE DO HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HOWEVER WE HAVE ONGOING FUNDING FROM PRIOR BUDGETS TO INCLUDE THIS YEAR WE'RE FOCUSING ON ROOFS- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE. HUMANE LIVING CONDITIONS SLEEPING CONDITIONS AND EVEN AT THAT- I KNOW THE EFFECTS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHEN HOUSING UNITS CLASSROOMS PROGRAM AREAS. THEY NOT ONLY FOR THE INNOCENT THE EFFECTIVE STAFF LIVE THERE WITH MOLD WITH THERE IS I'M SENDING MY- TO DO SEARCHES AND JUST BE THERE FOR EIGHT TO SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY THEY NEED TO BE UP TO PAR- SO. IT'S INTO THE BILLIONS BUT WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR IN THIS JUSTIN THIS BUDGET CYCLE IS YOU KNOW IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH CARE SIDE FOR SECRECY. AND THEN- AT SOME POINT ONGOING FUNDING TO CONTINUE OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FROM YEARS PAST WITH THE FOCUS ON ROOFS. NOT TO MENTION WE ALSO HAVE- FUNDING SECURED FOR INFILL FOR MEDICAL SPACES TO EXPAND THEN FOR OUR INMATE POPULATION SO WE CAN BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR- WITH A PLOT OF COURT ORDERS A MEDICAL LAWSUITS THAT WERE IN- SO IT'S QUITE SUBSTANTIAL- I. HAVE PEOPLE SAID NOT THAT THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE EXACT DOLLAR BUT WAS. IN ON THE TWELVE PRISON. STUDY PIECE. THAT VERY HELP HELLO TWO AND A- I DO HAVE THAT NUMBER FOR THE OTHER 20% OF OUR- HELPFUL. I'M SORRY AS- DHEA SAID THE ELEVEN THERE THERE WAS VERY IN DEPTH STUDY THAT WAS JUST ISN'T WRAPPED UP ON THE TWELVE ALL. PRAISE THAT RECORD A LOT OF OVERLAY BILLION DOLLARS IN REPAIRS- CITIES HERE IS ESTIMATED AND- WITH. THAT SORT OF A DIFFERENT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTMETHODOLOGIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY APPLES TO APPLES TO THOSE NUMBERS BUT HAS ESTIMATED. THAT THE NUMBER THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE REQUIRED AT THE OTHER TWENTY TWO PRISONS BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WOULD BE AROUND. EIGHT BILLION. HI I APPRECIATE THAT I BECAUSE BECAUSE WHILE THE THREAT OF OUR CONVERSATION TODAY IS FOCUSED ON THE CURRENT BUDGET AND THE- ANTICIPATION AND EXCITEMENT AROUND YOU KNOW POTENTIAL CLOSURE AND BRING PEOPLE BACK OUT OF STATE ALL OF WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE TO BE MINDFUL. OF OUR YOU KNOW LESS EXCITING MORE ARCANE RESPONSIBILITY AS LANDLORDS AND EMPLOYERS AND MAKING SURE SO I WANT TO JUST ALL OF US TO HAVE A- GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT THOSE OVERALL COSTS ARE IN TERMS OF MAINTENANCE ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR ME THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MR NIELSEN- BECAUSE- THAT DOLLAR FIGURE ALSO LEADS TO BE. CONSIDERED WHEN WE THINK ABOUT- WANT TO DRAW AN IMMEDIATE CORRELATION TO THE REDUCTION POPULATION AND YET WHY IS NOT THE CITY SEE OUR BUDGET YOU KNOW DECLINE IN THAT IT'S AN EQUAL RIGHT THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY. BUT IF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE LA- WHOEVER CHOOSES TO RESPOND COULD GIVE US A HIGH LEVEL SINCE OF WHAT SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COST DRIVERS ARE. TO THE BUDGET DESPITE THE POPULATION DECLINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUTTING IN CONTEXT THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DEBT REDUCTION ALL BIDS ON THE SAYING. FIVE PRE SHEET THAT BUT IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US A HIGH LEVEL. UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SOME OF THOSE COSTS DRIVERS ARE TO HELP EDUCATE THE COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE AND OUR MEMBERSHIP AT THE DID SENATE AS A WHOLE SO WE STOP. WITH THAT RATHER YOU KNOW KIND OF SOFT MORE ARITHMETIC GAME IF WE'RE DOWN BY FIVE PEOPLE THEN WE SHOULD BE DOWN BY 5% IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE SO TALK TO US ABOUT SOME OF THE COST DRIVERS PLEASE I THINK- I'LL SPEAK I'LL TAKE A STAB AT AND I THINK THE THINGS THAT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH. IS THE FIRST ONE IS THE HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH COSTS AND HAVE RISEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT. THAT HAVE BEEN AS A RESULT OF- COURT ORDERS BUT EVEN BEYOND THE COURT OR JUST DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE POPULATION. SO THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS- ONE OF THE SECOND PIECE IS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS- THEY HAVE GONE UP- AND I DO GET QUESTIONED I WAS QUESTION IN THE LA TIMES ARTICLE LAST YEAR WHEN A PARTICULAR BY UNIT GOT A RAISE IN THE **** DO YOU SECRETARY BELIEVE THAT THEY DESERVED A RAISE AND THAT'S KIND OF A LOADED QUESTION. NO WAY RESPONDED WAS AT I DEMAND OF MY EMPLOYEES AND THEY DO A JOB THAT MANY STONE MANY PEOPLE CAN'T OR WON'T DO. SO I DO DEMAND A LOT SO THAT'S A RELATIVE QUESTION. SO I DO BELIEVE THEY DESERVE THE COMPENSATION THEY'RE GETTING. SO THAT THAT'S BEEN ANOTHER DRIVER AND- THE THIRD DRIVER- REALLY HAS COME FROM- YOU KNOW THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM EXPANSIONS THAT WE HAVE INVESTED IN. AND THESE ARE INVESTMENT DOLLARS US WAY LOOK AT THEM. AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM PRIOR PANELS IN THE LAST PANEL. THESE ARE INVESTMENT DOLLARS AT AS WE HAVE GROWN A REHABILITATIVE CATALOG AND PORTFOLIO. WE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY. AND WE WERE TRYING TO BE A DYNAMIC. REHABILITATIVE AGENCY NOT JUST GOING BY THE OLD WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS IS SOMETHING WORK FIVE YEARS AGO THAT MEANS IT'S GOING TO WORK THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BECAUSE WE HAVE NEW POPULATIONS IN NEW AGES AND DEMOGRAPHICS COME IN INSTITUTIONS WITH NEW NEEDS AND WE HAVE TO. MEET THE MORE THE RAT WITH THE CURRENT NEEDS SO EVERYTHING FROM THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR- ADVANCEMENTS TO- WHAT I CALL SOME MORE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT AT TIMES WE GET. I GET ASKED YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE BASE WHICH IS A VERY VALID QUESTION BUT I ALWAYS LOOK AT THOSE AS THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT COME IN THEIR PRIMERS. FOR INDIVIDUALS. WITH AND STOP AND- TOWARDS A MORE EVIDENCE BASED. PROGRAM WHERE THEY HAVE TO ACHIEVE MILESTONES IN THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE EXAMINATIONS AND THAT THE PROOF. THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED CONCEPTS AND THAT THE HOW THE DEPARTMENT TO THE LIFE TO LIVES. SO ARE WE- PORTFOLIO CATALOG IS TO HAVE TO EXPAND YEARS. WE HAVE A MORE SERIOUS INVITE. POP THAT WE HAD IN YOUR- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SENT US. AS WE WERE YOUNGER PA. COME TO US ONE OF THE BUDGET I JUST FOR A- IF. FOR EXT. AT VALLEY STAY PRISON AND THAT'S FOR INDIVIDUAL CENTERS FROM NINE. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO YEARS AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LITTLE SEVEN. OF THOSE INTO. THE RIGHT NOW IN A PRISON SYSTEM IN MADE AGE AGES FOR EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY THERE'S OVER TEN THOUSAND. THAT'S A OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUR ANSWER. HAVE SEE THE IN MY THE YEARS I STARTED A ONE OF AGE. I SEEN IN MAYES COMING AT TWO ONE TWO NOW THERE YEARS OLD LIKE ME. AND I JUST THINK IF WE WERE ABLE TO REACH SOMEONE I BEGAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE GONE THROUGH. SOME OF THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS THAT OCCUR IN THE DAYS OF OLD IN PRISON WE DO HAVE ISLAND INCIDENT STILL. BUT I THINK IF WE REACH THEM- WITH- WITH THE MORE- INFORMED AND A MORE. COGNIZANT WAY OF REACHING THEM IN WHATEVER THEIR NEEDS ARE SO I THINK THE THIRD ONE IS A REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS. THANK YOU ELIA AT WE ACTUALLY DID JUST RELEASE A BRIEF FOR READ A ADDRESS THIS QUESTION OF WHY. THE A BUDGET FOR CITIES HERE IS INCREASED BY OVER THREE BILLION WHEN THE INMATE POPULATION DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL AS A POORLY POPULATION SO. I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW NOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE. WE IDENTIFIED THREE MAJOR DRIVERS OF CDC ARE EXPENDITURES OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO- THE FIRST ONE IS THE COURT ORDERS THAT I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER IN MISTER DE IDEA REFERENCED- THE ORDER TO REDUCE PRISON OVERCROWDING. MEANT THAT THE STATE HAD TO. HAD TO NOT ONLY REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION BUT ALSO EXPAND CAPACITY BY BUILDING AND ACTIVATING NEW- INFILL AND WHAT A NEW PRISON AND NEW INFILL CAPACITY ON PRISON GROUNDS- AS WELL AS- CONTRACTING FOR ADDITIONAL CAPACITY SO- AND LEASING FACILITIES SO WE'RE ACTUALLY. DESPITE THE POPULATION DECLINE OPERATING MORE FACILITIES THAN WE WERE BEFORE SAYS OVERHEAD COSTS OF HAVE. AN INCREASED AND STAFFING COSTS- IT WE'VE ALSO HAD TO COMPLY- WITH OR COURT ORDERS RELATED TO EXPANDING IN MADE HEALTH CARE WHICH HAS BEEN QUITE COSTLY- AND SO. WHILE THE STAFFING LEVELS DID DECLINE OVERALL STAFF DID TO SOMEONE. A REALIGN YOU KNOW FOR PERHAPS FROM THINGS LIKE NOT HAVING TO OPERATE- GYMNASIUMS AS HOUSING UNITS AND- THE PRO POPULATION DECLINE ALSO WOULD HAVE COSTS AND STAFFING INCLINED- THESE FACTORS SUCH AS- A- ACTIVATING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING HEALTH CARE STAFF IN PARTICULAR HAVE. BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF STAFF TO RETURN TO ROUGHLY PRE LINE REALIGNMENT LEVELS- THE SECOND ISSUE A SECOND MAJOR DRIVER AND IS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SO EVEN. THOUGH THAT WERE AT THE SAME ROUGHLY SAME- STAFFING LEVEL AS WE WERE PRE ALIGN REALIGNMENT- WE'RE SPENDING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. THE COST PER EMPLOYEE HAS INCREASED BY REALIGNMENT- THAT'S DOUBLE THE RATE OF INFLATION- THAT'S- MAINLY BEAT FOR TWO REASONS- THAT WE IDENTIFIED. AND THAT IS THAT AG PENSION CONTRIBUTION RATES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY THOSE ARE SET BY THE CALPERS BOARD AND WE'RE INCREASED- RELATED TO- IN ORDER TO PAY FOR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES THAT GREW DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND THEN ALSO SALARY GROWTH OF- CITIES ARE STAFF GREW. AS SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AND THEN THE THIRD FACTORY IDENTIFIED WAS- AS YOU ALLUDED TO EARLIER HAT WE DID THE STATE DID- AS A WAY TO- GET THROUGH TO THE GREAT. RISK IN THE FISCAL CRISIS THE STATE DID- SHIFT COSTS FROM THOSE EARLY YEARS AROUND THE ERROR OF THE TIME A REALIGNMENT TO LATER YEARS SO- A BIG EXAMPLE OF THAT IS FOR ALLOWING OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS SO- WHEN WE- ASK FOR FURLOUGHS WHEN WE FOR LOW CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WE STILL HAVE TO. GUARD THE PRISONS SO- ESSENTIALLY WE GIVE OFFICERS INCREASE LEAVE TIME IN EXCHANGE FOR REDUCED PAY AND SO THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OFFICERS LEAVE BALANCES DURING THE- THE FISCAL CRISIS- WHICH ARTIFICIALLY THIS ARTIFICIALLY REDUCED CITY SIR EXPENDITURES IN THE EARLY YEARS. AND NOW IT'S THOSE OFFICERS ARE RETIRING WERE CATCHING THAT OUT WE'RE PAYING FOR OVERTIME TO BACKFILL WHEN THEY TAKE VACATION SO THAT ARTIFICIALLY INCREASING EXPENDITURES IN LATER YEARS SO IT'S REALLY ALSO IN SOME WAYS NOT AN APPLES TO APPLES TO LOOK AT WHEN THE STATE WAS IN RECESS THE RECESSION VERSES. LATER SO AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- HAD THE INMATE POPULATION NOT DECLINE IN THE IT SING BY THE SIGNIFICAN MOUNT THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST DECADE- THE STATE WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY WILL HAVE LESS LIKELY VERY LOW WOULD HAVE HAD TO IN ORDER TO COMPLY ITH THAT. OVERCROWDING ORDER WOULD HAVE HAD TO CONTRACT FOR SAY A SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CAPACITY AND OR BUILD POTENTIALLY SOME PRISONS WOULD HAVE HAD. MAKE YOU KNOW ENSURE HELL CARE FOR EVEN IN MADE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN E. MORE CA. AND WE COULD BE SPENDING- BILLIONS OF POTENTIALLY OF DOLLARS MORE NOW THAN WE ARE. TODAY SO WE'RE STILL SAVING IN THAT SENSE. THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL. ANY OTHER COMMENTS BEFORE WE ARE A TURN OVER DECISION NIELSEN THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR TO NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND BEFORE I. GO UNDER THE DIGITAL QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. ON THE DRIVING FACTORS WHICH RELATED TO THE INMATE LAWSUITS. AND I'M- IMPLICATING PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN AND LEGISLATURE'S RATING WAY BACK. THAT THE ORIGINAL LAWSUIT. WE'RE NOT NEARLY AS ONEROUS. AND HAD THE STATE ACTED PRO ACTIVELY THOSE AND GOES BACK TO THE- LATE EIGHTIES THE PARTICULAR THROUGH NIGHT. THE LAWSUITS WOULD NEVER BE WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. BUT THE STATE DID NOT ACT PRO ACTIVELY. AND SO THE FINAL TWELVE SWOOP WITH THE FEDERAL COURTS GETTING FRUSTRATED SAYING LOOK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT WE WILL TAKE OVER. SO THE PREMIUM IS ON BEING MORE PROACTIVE. HERE THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIMES. WHEN I BECAME CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF PRISON TERMS MANY YEARS AGO. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I LEARNED IS IT. REHABILITATION IN THE INSTITUTION WITHIN AN ADEQUATE. AND I COULDN'T REALLY COUNT ON THAT B. AND A HUGE FACTOR IN THE REHABILITATION OF ANY PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. BECAUSE IT WAS INADEQUATE IN PART BECAUSE- NOBODY EVER PAID ANY ATTENTION TO TRACK TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THOSE PROGRAMS AND I THINK THE SECRETARY REFERRED TO A LITTLE BIT AGO. IT ISN'T JUST THAT YOU WENT TO A OR IN A OR BREAKING BARRIERS OR WHATEVER. DID YOU INTERNALIZE IT COULD YOU TAKE THAT ON YOURSELF. AND APPLY IT. IN I HAD WANTED YOU TO FROM THE MOMENT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO I RAN INTO A MAN AND A CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THINGS IN STORE SACRAMENTO THE CAME UP TO ME SAID YOU KNOW YOU CHANGE MY WHOLE LIFE THE CENTER I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW HOW. YOU CHAIRED MY PAROLE HEARING. THEN YOU DID NOT FIND THE SUITABLE. BUT YOU TOLD ME WHAT I NEEDED TO DO. TO BE FOUND SUITABLE. THEN I GOT A COPY OF DECISION. IN A CAPITA. AND A LEARN BY. IN ANY EXTOLLED THE VIRTUES AND WHAT NEW NOW DEL ARE TELLING US HERE TODAY YOU WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO BUSINESS AND YOU DID ANY CHANGE. I MY POINT IS THAT WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS WE NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER JOB OF FOLLOWING THE INDIVIDUAL THROUGH THEIR TREATMENT REGIMENS. TO SEE IF THEY DO THEIR JOB. I WANNA THANK SECTOR DS AS WELL IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE TO WORK WITH HIM SOME SINCE HIS. TENURE BEGAN ON THE- ON THAT AS A SECRETARY THERE. AND IT'S TOUGHEST JOB IN GOVERNMENT. FOR THE AGENCY PEOPLE. THE PORTAL IN THE INSTITUTION. AND IT'S PRETTY TOUGH JOB FOR THE INMATES TO. WHEN I'VE HAD PEOPLE TELL ME OVER THE YEARS- THEY HAVE THAT'S A COUNTRY CLUB ALL THEY DO IS WATCH TV AND GET THEIR THREE SQUARES. WELL I SAID THAT'S NOT A CUT CLUB YOU WILL TO GO TO. IF YOU ARRANGE TO GET IN THERE FOR A WHILE ACT ARRANGE IT FOR YOU. I DON'T DIFFERENCE TO YOU THOUGH YOU'LL KNOW THERE'S A GAVE GUNDRY AND YOU LEAVE. PRESS ARE NOT COUNTRY CLUB. AND THE ISSUE OF PERSONNEL WHO WORK THERE IN. WHAT MY GREATEST CONCERNS. WITH THE PEOPLE IN MY EMPLOY. WASN'T TAKEN AT HOME. THEN I LEARNED HOW TO SEE WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN AT HOME. AND I BRING HIM IN THE OFFICE ALONE SEC TAKEN OUT. WHAT I MEAN AFTER ALL. I MEAN. AND TRY TO WORK THEM SO THAT THEY COULD CALL. THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT AND IT IS CALLED BY CORRECTING PIECE OFF TO THE TOUGHEST BEAT FOLKS IT IS THE TOUGHEST BEAT. THEY GET CRITICIZED AN AWFUL LOT. IT IS THE TOUGHEST BEAT. AND WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN. TO MAKE THE INSTITUTIONS BETTER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL DARIAN AND TO ENSURE THE REHABILITATIVE. PURPOSE AND MISSION. IS EFFECTIVE BUT LET US NOT FORGET AS WELL THOUGH INSTITUTIONS ARE ALL FOR PUNISHMENT AS WELL. BUT THE BIGGEST ELEMENT OF THE SYSTEM. THIS JUSTICE. JUSTICE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND ARE YOU IN THEIR TIME. AND JUSTICE FOR CRIME VICTIMS. NOW OF LATE EVEN IN THIS BUILDING CRIME VICTIMS ARE PRETTY WELL IGNORED. FACTORY BEEN REDEFINED WHO THEY ARE. THAT DOES CONCERN ME. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU LOOK AT IN A THE- IS THERE IN REMORSE. ARE THEY CAPABLE OF FOR THEM SO IN THE SHOES. OF THE PEOPLE THE BASED OF WHAT THE DEBT. MANY CAN. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MUST REALLY EMPHASIZE IS EARLY INTERVENTION BROKEN WINDOW THEORY. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IN HOW MANY PAROLEES TO DEATH ROW INMATES. THAT I'M QUITE IT WITH THEIR LIFE HISTORIES. AND A WHIP IN MY HEART FOR THE CHILD THEY WERE. DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE. BUT I HAVE TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR CONSEQUENCES THINGS HE DID LATER ON. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON A SOCIETY IS OUR FAMILY. THE STRENGTHENING OF FAMILIES. IN THE ROLE THE PARENTS IN THOSE FAMILIES. AND I KNOW THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. THERE WAS ALWAYS A DELIGHT WHEN YOU WOULD SEE THE BLACK GOAL OFTEN SOMEBODY'S EYES AND THEY THEY GOT IT. WELL ENOUGH OF THAT PROTECTED THE AS I WANT TO ALSO YOU FOR COOPERATING WITH SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS INSTRUCTED MAYBE TO THE- BOARD HERE'S- THE COMMITTEE. YOUR AGENCY HAS COOPERATED WITH ME FOR SOME TWENTY YEARS CONDUCTING A SEMINAR ON THE DEATH PENALTY AT SAN QUENTIN EVERYYEAR FOR THE EGG LEADERSHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS A FELLOWSHIP FOR ABOUT THIRTY FARMERS. MY EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH THE DEATH PENALTY IS I HAD TO DIRECTLY TO TEN TIMES. IS THIS IS A VERY GRAVE AND HEAVY ISSUE ALWAYS A PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE IT EBBS AND FLOWS IT'LL ALWAYS BE THERE. BUT I HAVE DECIDED TO CONDUCT THIS AS THE SEMINAR FOR THESE FELLOWS. AND WE BEGIN I TELL IN THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IT'S LIKE YOU COMING HERE TO HEAR ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY THEY WE HAVE PEOPLE SPEAK FOR AGAINST. HIM HAD A DEATH ROW INMATE FROM. OKLAHOMA WAS WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. CAME AND SPOKE SEVERAL YEARS TO US. GREG WILL HEART. I SAID THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE DEATH PENALTY IT'S ABOUT YOU HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH A VERY GRAVE ISSUE. OR NO LONGER IS IT GOING TO BE AS ABSTRACT AS IT HAS BEEN BEFORE. NOT MY POINT TO THAT IS JUST AS FAR SOCIETY LOOKS AT THIS SYSTEM AND MAYBE SOMETIMES SAYS FLIP AND THINGS ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND ABOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM. WE CAN DO BETTER MISSED WHAT WAY I COMMEND YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THEIR TO NEW DOING IT SUCCESSFULLY. YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF IN THOSE SHOES. AND YOUR SHOWING THE APATHY. AND YOUR GIVEN INDIVIDUALS SOME HELP THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THAT ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE THEN WAS. AN AUDIT LAST YEAR THAT SHOWED. NOT A VERY BIG IMPACT ON RECIDIVISM. BY OUR CUSTODY PROGRAMS. NOW THAT SADLY VALIDATES THE FUNCTIONS THAT I HAD LIVING AS I DID FOR A WHOLE LOT OF YEARS. ANYBODY PIPE UP AND GIVE ME SOME THOUGHTS HOW WE CAN DO BETTER ON THAT KEEPING TRACK. MAYBE SECTOR DIAZ I'LL I'LL TAKE A STAB AT IT SO IN A RECIDIVISM IS A NUMBER THAT CORRECTIONS HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN GAUGED ON SOMEONE OF OUR REPORT CARD AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S AN ACCURATE- YOU KNOW AN ACTOR REPORTER AND I THINK I THINK MR WILEY SPOKE TO ABOUT HOW RECIDIVISM I LOOK AT RECIDIVISM AS A- AS A CALIFORNIA NUMBER NOT A CDC OUR NUMBER. IS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN OUR SYSTEM A ONE DAY RELEASED BACK TO COMMUNITIES I THINK THE REPORT YOU SAW IS- RECIDIVISM THE LAST NUMBER THAT WE PUT OUT ITS RELATIVELY STAGNANT IT DID MOVE VERY MUCH. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S IT ISN'T WORKING BECAUSE ONE THERE IS A SLIGHT SLIGHT DOWNTURN IS NOT A FULL POINT BUT PERCENTAGE POINTS DOWN ON CRIMES AGAINST PERSONS. WHAT HAS KEPT THAT RELATIVELY STAGNANT IS THE PROPERTY CRIMES PIECE YEAH SO I WAS I'M HAPPY TO- AND I APPRECIATE THE FUNDING WE RECEIVED AS WE'RE GOING TO BE ADDRESS IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. ROLE IN THAT PROGRAM OUT- AND ADDRESSING THE SUCH AS BUSA SOARING NEEDS OF INMATES AND THEN I WAS VERY HAPPY HERE YESTERDAY STATE OF THE STATE ON HOW YOU'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND THE MEDICARE SERVICES SO THERE WILL WE WILL HAVE THAT CONTINUITY OF CARE. OF THAT SERVICE FROM PRISON INTO THE COMMUNITIES- BECAUSE IF WE DON'T ADDRESS ALL SUCH AS ABUSE DISORDER NEEDS- WE'RE JUST SET PEOPLE UP FOR A RETURN. AND A THREE YEAR OLD COHORTS THAT WE USE FOR COUNTY RECIDIVISM IS ARREST CONVICTION AND RETURN TO STATE PRISON. SO IT'S A PRETTY HIGH BAR ON HOW WE CAN RECIDIVISM BY THOSE THREE POINTS SO- I'M I'M HOPEFUL I WAS GLAD I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT- YOU KNOW RECIDIVISM. GO DOWN WHICH IS A GOOD MARKER BUT IT'S LIKE I SAID EARLIER IT'S REALLY A CALIFORNIA EFFORT AS WE BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES AND COMMUNICATING THE SHERIFFS AND CHIEFS OF POLICE- AND ALL TO EMPLOYERS OUT THERE THAT INDIVIDUALS LIVE IN OUR PRISONS. THE THEY ARE RECEIVING. NATIONALLY CERTIFIED BOB SKILLS LIKE BE YOU. IN THAT ALL IN IS THAT. THIRD CHANCE SOME. AND THE TO DO THAT. AND WE JUST CAN'T COUNT THE- THINGS READ IN THE PAPER OF THESE HORRIFIC ACTS OF A READ SOMETIME. THAT THAT'S ALL OF THEM THAT'S ALL OF THEM. THAT'S A SMALLER SMALLER PERCENTAGE AND WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW EVERY VIOLENT ACT BY PEOPLE LIVE IN PRISON IS A- THIS IS A IS A TRAGIC ACT AND IT. REFLECTS POORLY ON THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY TRYING. TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND HOW SOME PEOPLE PAY IN A BAD LIGHT ON. THE MAJORITY PEOPLE WHO JUST WANTED TO WRITE AND JUST GET THE SECOND AND THIRD CHANCE. SO I THINK THE ARM AND FOR MY PART I THINK MORE COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITIES. BUILDING BETTER PARTNERSHIPS WITH- PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT. WE DO HAVE A DIVISION OF CORRECTIONS PRESENT EMPLOYMENT WE HAVE A POINT PERSON WHO'S OUT THERE BUILDING TIES WITH- WITH UNIONS WITH- WORKFORCE ARE GETTING PEOPLE JOBS WHEN THEY GET OUT. SO I THINK. YOU KNOW I HOPE I SHOULD LIVE BLOOD ON YOUR OF THE- THANK YOU AND GOOD KEEP MIND TO. IT BECAUSE I THINK. STATURE SOME SKEWED A BIT BECAUSE THE CORRECT IF YOU AGO. RE DEFINED. TO LET THE ABOUT THIS. THAT DOES INDEED HAVE ITS IMPACT- SO THE SOME SOME COLLECTION. THERE THE LAST WEEK. JAILS I WHEN REAL PASS THAT THE LAWSUIT WERE GOING TO RIGHT TO THE CAR JAILS DID PRESIDENT WAS A ONE WITHIN MONTHS OF THE PASSAGE OF REALIGNMENT. IN THE AND HOW. ARE GOING TO BE FORCED THE- TO PROVIDE A COMEDY. TO SELL CAPITAL COST A GREAT MY REBUILT. A SECURE FACE OF CONCERN A NEVER EVER HAD TO BEFORE. THE TICKET IS AT HAS THE- MORE MAYBE ANALYST FOR THE SEVEN OF YOU SOME KIND. OF HOW GOING TO BE REALLY ABLE TO THOSE COUNTIES WITH THIS. LET'S LET'S GIVE ANALYST AT IT. A I THINK YOU'RE- AWARE OF GOVERNOR DID HAVE A MENTION OF A PROPOSAL TANK THE STATE OVERSIGHT OF JAIL IN THE- OVER OF THE GOVERNORS BUT OVER IS. THE IT'S FICTION WE COUNTS GOOD OVERSIGHT IS JUST MEAN PUT MORE ON THE COUNTY THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER SO IT IS A WAS GET A STATUS BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE. AT THIS ISSUE WORSE IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING IT AND- WE ARE THINKING HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THE ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TREES THAT WERE WHAT IS LOW ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD ON TO THAT IT IS IT THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATE OVER THE YEARS HAVE HAS AUTHORIZED I BELIEVE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN LEASE REVENUE FUNDS TO HELP COUNTIES- STRUCTURE REDUCE THEIR JAIL SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO BE BETTER FOCUSED ON- REHABILITATION AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND IN MANY CASES A LOT OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE STILL IN PROCESS EVEN THOUGH THE AT THIS POINT THE FUNDING HAS BEEN- AUTHORIZED QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO. SO IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO ASSESS WHAT THE IMPACT OF PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED FUNDING IS ON- COUNTY NEEDS GOING FORWARD SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THERE'S A LOT NOT APPROPRIATED. BUT STILL AROUND WHERE'S THE MONEY. NOT THAT IT'S NOT A- IT'S GOING OUT TO THE COUNTIES THE COUNTY IS A JUST IN PROCESS OF CAN. AND A LOT OF THE FACILITIES HAVE YET TO BE ACTIVATED AND MAKE A DENT INTO THE NEEDS- KEEP IN MIND THAT'S A LONG TERM INSPECTOR DSW HAVING ON THAT POINT ABOUT THE JAILS I DO SIT ON THE- BE A CC. THEN I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT OVERSIGHT BUT- WE JUST HAD A MEETING WE DID DISCUSS THAT OVERSIGHT BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY. LIKE I TALKED ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS I DO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. AND I KNOW THEY DO SEEK FROM TIME TO TIME LITTLE INSIGHT ON THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT. AND I'M AVAILABLE AND OPEN FOR ANY YOU KNOW ADVICE FOR INSIDE OR SOME OF OUR SUCCESSES AND I THINK WE LEARN MORE. FROM OUR FAILURE SOMETIMES AND TELLING THINGS TRIUMPH. ON THE- CHINA BUY THEM THAT ROW THAT THE- SHOULD GO. WELL THE MONEY HI MY OB. MR ACTORS SIDE AND OF THE- NECESSARY. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEAD. AND. THE DIMINISH. REGULARLY THEY DON'T THINGS ON ALL. GO AND THE STAYED. YOURSELF WE HAVE GOT TO SEE. OUR SUPPORT. LOW GOVERNMENT AS A- GO THROUGH THIS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS SO I'M CERTAINLY. TO WITH YOU SIR. BUT YOU HAVE SOME YES THEY YOU WANTED TO A COUPLE OF NOTES THE ON THE IMPACT ON JAIL I THINK THE FIRST I WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT IT. WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT RELY ON PUT THE DISH ASPECT. ON JAIL THESE MANY OF THE LAWSUITS THAT THAT YOU'RE AFTER PROVED RELY ON THERE ARE LET THERE'S ON GO TO GET FOR TAX NOW LOCAL. SO WHICH IS NOT SUGGEST THAT THAT. ON A DIDN'T PUT A DISH PRESSURE JUST WANTED TO THAT AS CON I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. DESERVES SUBSTANTIAL OPERATE RISK HAVE PROVIDED TO THE WALL TO FOR THE POP THAT HAS BEEN. OVER THE YEARS AND OF COURSE ALWAYS HAVE TO ABOUT WHETHER THAT THE APPROACH AMOUNT NOT BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT WE ARE- ESTIMATING ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS- INTO THE TWENTY ONE. BUT COUNTY. FOR DELAY WITH THE- THAT WOULD REAL. AS PART OF A ONE ON THE- HI INCLUDING. THAT WILL GO TO LOCAL TO AND THEN JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE TO WHAT MISTER SO TO BE. NOTED THE FUN FOR. THE ACT INFER FOR LOCAL WE APPROVED ABOUT ONE SEVEN. DOLLARS IN AND BY THE FLOOR TO. TAKE FACILITY AT THE WALL LEVEL THEN AS MR SO. NOTE MALES PROJECTS ARE IN PROCESS SO THINK WE HAVE THE TO SEE AN- WHAT. IMPACT ON BEHALF. THANK YOU AND AGAIN A DEAL THANK YOU YOUR DEBT. THAT IS A JOB HAVE SIR. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU VERY MUCH US INTO NIELSEN THING FOR THE CALL FOR. SO I KNOW. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WE FOR OVER THE ROLLED BSE SEE IS IN A PRE TO THE- BID PROCESS. WHERE A SHERIFF'S APPLY FOR THE DOLLARS TO FOR BRAND NEW CAN AND AS I RECALL THAT WAS LARGELY. PULSE TO REALIGN. CENTER MORE LAW CARE TO TAKE LEAVE BUT I HAVE A FINANCE OR OR MAYBE. BY COMMITTEE STAFF HE QUEST IS WHAT. REGARDING THE OVER CAUGHT OF THE- AND THEY GET. ON THE TIME FRAME. COMPLETE IT. THE RECEIVER TO COMPLETE WORK AND ALL HEALTH RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE ARE SO SOMEONE COULD THAT IN TO SET A MORE IT IS I THAT WOULD BE A PRE TO DO IT BUT IF WE GET TO SENATOR LOTS OF THAT WILL BE A FOR SENT TO SKINNER IS NOW FOLLOWED DOCTOR PAY AND SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND A- ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AS THE OF THE THAT GO INTO THE ISSUES IN GREAT DETAIL OF COURSE THERE'S MANY THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO DELVE INTO BUT WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY EVERY THURSDAY FOR THE NEXT X. NUMBER OF WEEKS TO DO THAT- AND JUST SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. WE OF COURSE WILL DEAL WITH ARE THINGS LIKE- AS WAS RAISED BY ELIO DI THESE TWO COURT CASES THE COLEMAN AND THE PLOTTER HAVE IN THE COST IN AS A WEIGHT BACK. AS OUR SUBCOMMITTEE WHAT WE ARE WHAT WE ARE BOTH CHARGED WITH AND- I THINK LOOKING THROUGH THE LENS OF IS JUST AS BUDGET OVERSIGHT. HOW TO OF MAKES THAT WE ARE USING OUR DOLLARS MOST EFFECTIVELY AND DUE TO THE- IN FACT IT'S GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THE INCREASE. IN TERMS OF THIS PRESSURE AND GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WHICH OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE LEGISLATURE HAS LOTS OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO USE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR SO WE'RE TRYING TO. MIND THE STORE VERY CAREFULLY THAT WE'RE USING A MOST EFFECTIVELY IN KEEPING COSTS DOWN. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE VERY COGNIZANT OF CONDITIONS FOR THE STAFF AND FOR OUR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. AND PUBLIC SAFETY SO THOSE OF THE LANDS THAT WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH ALL OF THE TIME- AND SO WE WILL GET INTO DETAIL IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE AROUND THE COLEMAN IN THE PLOT TO CASES AND WHETHER AT WHAT POINT WE WILL GET OUT OF THESE RECEIVERS SHIPS- AND WE WILL ALSO BE- WANTING THAT WASN'T TO TALK ABOUT BUT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. IN ACTED LAST YEAR WAS THIS. TO MOVE. THE DJ. TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND RATHER THAN US GETTING INTO IT TODAY ALL STEVE IT FOR MYSELF EIGHTY SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF MY QUESTIONS IS. THAT AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY MOST EVERYONE THAT THE WE IS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE STATED GOAL TO REDUCE FACILITIES WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT. IS WITH APPROPRIATE POPULATION REDUCTIONS- AND SO RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON EITHER HOW DO WE CHOOSE WHICH FACILITY OR THAT SORT OF THING I'D RATHER SORT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TO. GET THOSE POPULATION REDUCTIONS IN- THIRTY SO FAR CORRECTLY RIGHTFULLY TALKED NUMBERS. BUT AS A MISTER FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE POINTED OUT OBVIOUSLY THERE THIS IS MORE. THAN THAT. THE NUMBERS REPRESENT PEOPLE. AND WE BE DOING IN A WAY. THAT INTEREST PUBLIC SAFE AND THAT. HAS FAR FOLKS WERE RELEASED IN KIND OF SIR THAT MISSED JOHNSON THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE AS WE RICH PEOPLE TO WE WANT TO BE A TO SUCCESS RANCH AND BE IN OUR CAN. AND TO MISTER AGREED OF THAT SO IS IT THAT WE DESIGNED THE APPROPRIATE POPULATION REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED THE APPROPRIATE POPULATION REDUCTIONS WITH THAT SAME TIME THAT WE ACHIEVE THIS TYPE OF REAL REHABILITATION. SO LET ADD SPECIFIC THE QUESTION FIRST. AND WITH MY FIRST QUESTION OUR POPULATION REDUCTION IS AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED WE HAVE A VERY AGING POPULATION IN OUR PRISON. AND THAT IS JUST LIKE HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THE OVERALL SOCIETY'S GENDER IN GENERAL THERE'S A SMALL PERCENT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BIGGEST COSTS OF THE HEALTHCARE MANY OF THEM ARE WITHIN THAT AGING POPULATION WE'VE PASSED MANY STRATEGIES RELATED TO THAT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL FROM REPORTS I'VE SEEN THEY'VE NOT REALLY AN IMPACTING MUCH REDUCTION POPULATION SO COULD WHOEVER ON THE PANELS- TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. I WHICH OF THOSE ARE WORK ON WINE IN WHAT OTHER STE. SHOULD WE PERHAPS BE CONSIDERING. I CAN GO AHEAD AND- GIVE AN ADDRESS THAT. YOU REFERENCE I THINK ARE THE ELDERLY POPULATION AND OUT- AN AGING POPULATION AND IT PEARL PROCESS FOR A INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE- GENERALLY CONSIDER IT CONSIDER FOR REAL RELEASE IF THEY SERVE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND REACH SIXTY YEARS OLD- AS YOU NOTED THAT PROCESS HASN'T BEEN ANY CITY HUGELY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF LARGE NUMBERS OF POPULATION REDUCTIONS- THAT COULD PERHAPS BE CHANGED IF THE THRESHOLDS WERE. SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED BY FOR EXAMPLE AND REDUCING NEED- TIME SERVE REQUIREMENT BENEATH TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR REDUCING THE AGE REQUIREMENT BELOW SIXTY YEARS- THERE'S A OTHER POPULATION MANAGEMENT OPTIONS THAT THE STATE HAS- WHICH I CAN GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF- SO TO FURTHER REDUCE THE OVERALL INMATE POPULATION- AND- THERE ISN'T THERE'S VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE STE AND THE STATE COULD REQUIRE THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS TO RELEASE TO INITIATE RELEASE CONSIDERATION FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS. UNDER THE PROP FIFTIES. ACCESS TO DAYS THAN NOW TO EXIT RELEASE AT SOME WE FREE READ IT COULD ALSO X. OUR TO MAKE COST PLACE. WHICH WOULD ALLOW IN UNDER CC I EXIT. CREDIT EARNING POLICIES TO- SIMPLY BY CHANGING OF THEIR HOUSING STATUS TO EARN CREDITS AT A FASTER RATE PUT IN- IN TURN- REDUCE THE INMATE POPULATION- OR- A COULD THE STATE COULD ENACT FURTHER SENSING CHANGES THE ELDERLY PRO PROCESS BEING ONE OF THEM BUT YOU KNOW. MANY MANY OTHER OPTIONS A CDC ARE ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT HAS CONTROL OVER IN MAY CREDIT EARNING SO IT COULD IT COULD CHANGE THOSE POLICIES WHICH WOULD. IN A WAY THAT WOULD REDUCE THE INMATE POPULATION- OTHER POPULATION MANAGEMENT OPTIONS- TO THE EXTENT AND THE STATE WANTS TO. REMOVE AND MAKE- REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES HOUSED IN STATE OPERATED STATE OWN PRISONS THAT IS THE THIRTY FOUR PERSONS THAT THE COURT ORDER. UP IS TO- FOR EXAMPLE THAT IT COULD CLOSE ONE OF THOSE PRISONS FASTER THAN OTHERWISE- THE STATE COULD INCREASE THE CONSERVATION CAMP POPULATION BIKE PAN NATO SUCH BY LAW INMATES WITH MY FOR. DETAINER AS INTO CAN AS WE READ IT CAN. THAT IS ONE. OF RECOMMENDED THIS COULD ALSO GET IN EXPANDING FOR INMATES TO CAN LIKE X. PAY COULD ALSO ALLOWING EXPANDING ALLAH FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THE ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM BY ADMITTING FOR EXAMPLE INMATES WITH MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS LEFT TO SERVE AND BY JUST TO KIND OF DRAW THAT POINT HOME THOSE THOSE ACTIONS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY REDUCE THE OVERALL AMOUNT MAY POPULATION BUT THEY WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES REQUIRED THAT THE STATE MUST HOUSE IN ITS- THIRTY FOR. I STATE OWNED PRISON. IN ORDER FOR ANYONE ELSE IN THE. I WOULD ADD THE ON THE ELDER PAROLE SO ELDERLY. TERRIBLE NAME. OF BUT IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THE MEASURES THAT WERE- ENACTED IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE OVERCROWDING SITUATION RESPONSES TO THE THREE JUDGE PANEL ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES WAS OF STARTING TO RECOGNIZE WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY INTO SIXTY ONE BUT TO RECOGNIZE PEOPLE WHO WERE YOUNG AT THE TIME OF THEIR CRIMES AND GOT LONG SENTENCES SHOULD GET SPECIALIZED CONSIDERATION PROCESS AN OPPORTUNE IN THE SHOW THAT THEY'VE CHANGED IN CAN SAFELY HOME. UP ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS I HAD WAS THAT. THAT THE LANGUAGE AND THOSE BILLS ALLOW THE BOARD TOO MUCH DISCRETION FRANKLY. AND WHAT WILD THERE'S A THERE'S GREAT PROMISE THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE SENTENCED UNDER AGE EIGHTEEN THOUSANDS MORE UNDER AGED TWENTY SIX WHICH IS THE NEW STANDARD. WHO QUALIFY FOR. FOR USE PAROLE HEARINGS- IN PRACTICE. THEIR PROGRAM RATES ARE WORSE. THEN EVERYBODY ELSE WORST THE AVERAGE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE DENIED PAROLE. CLEARLY NOT THE WHAT WE INTENDED WITH THAT RIGHT- IN THIS IS A THIS IS ALSO WHY YOU SEE THAT THE THERE HASN'T BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN AMONG THE IN IN THE AGING POPULATION ELDERLY PAROLE PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE PAROLE BOARD. STILL IS RELYING ON FACTORS THAT DON'T ALWAYS CORRELATE THE PUBLIC SAFETY. THEY ARE REACTING TO- VARIATIONS IN SOMEONE'S ARTICULATION OF INSIGHT REMORSE THAT DON'T ALWAYS MATCH WHAT THE BOARD THINKS IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND THEY'RE RELYING ON- ANCIENT RULE VIOLATIONS OR EVEN ALLEGATIONS ARE UNPROVEN WHICH IS REALLY A REALLY HUGE ISSUE. WHERE YOU HAVE BROKEN MISSIONERS WHO ARE QUESTIONING SOMEONE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT APPEARS IN A CONFIDENTIAL FOLDER TWENTY YEARS AGO. UP IN OUR THEY WERE NO A PERSON'S NEVER CHARGE WITH THE WAS HERE TO REFER GUILTY. THE COMMISSIONERS ARE INTERPRETING THIS ONE LINE ALLEGATION AS A STATEMENT OF FACT AND THEN WHEN THE PERSON DENIES IT TODAY. THEN YOU LACK CREDIBILITY LACK INSIGHT- UNSUITABLE FOR PAROLE THEY DENY THAT THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY MANY YEARS IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY REALLY. BUT IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH THE HOW COMFORTABLE COMMISSIONS ARE WITH THE PERSON APPEAR BEFORE THEM HOW THEY PRESENT ALL THOSE THINGS- SO AS LONG AS THERE IS THAT LEVEL OF DISCRETION. THAT CAN EASILY BE ABUSED UNFORTUNATELY. THEN I'LL THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. IN OUTCOMES THROUGH THE DISCRETIONARY PROPUESTAS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY HAS BECOME. OF THE MAIN WAY THAT WE PROVIDE ACCESS FOR PEOPLE TO COME HOME FROM PRISON AS IT IS WITH ALL THE REFORMS LAST YEAR'S ABOUT HALF THE PRISON POPULATION WILL GO TO THE PAROLE BOARD. BUT THE OUTCOMES ARE TERRIBLE FRANKLY LAST YEAR THE REPORTED I THINK NINETEEN AND A HALF PERCENT. PROGRAM RATE WHICH IS ABOUT WITH MAYBE A LITTLE LOWER THAN WAS THE YEAR BEFORE THAT AND I'M TOLD IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE LOWER THIS YEAR- SO WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO SWITCH SWITCH THOSE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO THE BEST SUITED AND IN A MORE MORE ALSO JOHNSON'S GET A CHANCE TO COME ALL. YES WHAT. THAT CLEARLY THIS YOU KNOW THE INTENT OF THE QUESTIONS FOR THE ELDERLY ELDERLY POPULATION WELL ACTUALLY. YES THAT WAS ONE. M. BUT GIVEN THAT WERE A KIND OF EXPANDING THAT IT'S OKAY I MEAN WHAT I'M MOST INTERESTED IN IS. WE NEED POPULATION REDUCTION BUT WE WANTED TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND WE WANT TO ENSURE TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND AS- MISTER WATLEY'S POINTED OUT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW PUT IN VARIETY OF BOTH VOTERS AND LEGISLATURE PUT IN A VARIETY OF. MEASURES TO IN EFFECT IMPACT THAT. AND SOME ARE WORKING SOME AREN'T BUT YOU KNOW WHAT STRATEGIES DO HAVE TO RECOMMEND TO US THAT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND STILL PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY ON ON ON THE BOARD QUESTION ABOUT- GRANTING OR THE NILES OR HOW THE REVIEW OF WHAT THE REVIEWER WHAT THEY CONSIDER- I KNOW THEY HAVE EXPANDED AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THEY THEY HAVE CHANGED ON HOW THEY LOOK AT THEM AND I KNOW THIS IS REALLY A QUESTION FOR THE COMMISSIONER BPH MISSION. TRYING TO GET FROM YOUR COME AT ALL BUT. I WILL SAY THEY HAVE REALLY RE. AND IS A DESIRE CHANGE. THAT THE YOU KNOW THE BOARD IS LOOKING A END OF. THAT ARE READY FOR RELEASE IN THE DON'T POSE A- OR UNREASONABLE WRIST. SAFETY ON THEY DO GO OUT AND I THINK. EVERYONE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RATES. YOU KNOW HAVE EXPANDED FROM THE YEARS PASSED TO WERE. YOU KNOW THEY WERE INTO THE HUNDREDS NOW FROM THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION THIS ADMINISTRATION TOTALLY WENT TO THE THOUSANDS. SO I THINK IT'S MORE OF A QUESTION OF BPH AND I KNOW THEY ARE RAMPING UP WITH MORE STAFFING I KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT NON VIOLENT. STAFF ENOUGH FOR THE NOT VIOLENT OFFENDER- BUT I THINK IT'S MORE OF A QUESTION FOR. BPH ON THE PAROLE PIECE- WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING AT CRAP EXPANDING AT ITS HOUSING PLACEMENT IT'S A GREAT MORE CREDITS. WE DO ASK OURSELVES QUESTIONS QUITE A BIT WE ARE SEVERAL YEARS IN. DC FROM THE TO IT WAS. SIMPLY ONE THING EVER CALL. OF A SET. IS I TO BE MIND. THAT IT ANY EXPANSION OF CREDITS TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT FOR THE PURPOSES. OF REHABILITATION NUMBER ONE. HANDING OUT CREDIT JUST TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT I. DO BELIEVE THAT MEASURE NET WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S MORE EFFECTIVE THAT NEEDS TO BE ON GOING- THAT WE DO LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS AND INTERNALLY WITHIN CDC ARE I AM MASS WHAT. CAN WE INCREASE THIS SECTION OF PEOPLE THAT. THE PEOPLE. I'M ALL FOR IT BUT I ALSO RECONCILE. IS THERE A PROPER REHABILITATIVE DOSAGE RECEIVED BY THE CIVIC. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM OUT LACKING NOR DO I WANT THEM UP A PREPARED FOR RE ENTRY SIR. SO FIELD FIFTY SEVEN CREDITS THAT THEY'RE STILL IN MY MIND WE STILL ARE. IN THE BUSINESS OF SEEKING WHAT IS BEST. ARE CAL POPULATION IS LOW OUR MINIMUM SUPPORT FACILITIES ARE MORE FULL BUT A CAP POPULATIONS AND LOGOS WHAT WE DID FIND. IS THAT- INMATES WOULD BE FIRST THING IN THE MINIMUM SUPPORT FACILITIES RATHER THAN GOING OUT TO FIRE CAMP. BECAUSE THEY SAY WE CAN LEARN THE SAME CREDIT I DON'T HAVE TO WORK AS HARD. THAT'S A MOTIVATION ISSUE. SO MAYBE I DO NEED TO DO. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PRESENTATION OF THAT GROUP MAYBE- AMPLIFIER MAGNIFY SO FAR POST RELEASE. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GETTING JOBS IN THE FIREFIGHTERS SERVER. SHOW THAT THERE IS JOB. FOR THEM THE- AND WE HAVEN'T VENTURA OTHERS ARE THERE. BUT NOW. I THINK. YOU KNOW IT'S- BREAST EXPAND JUST SICK OF NUMBERS. OF IT IT WE NERVOUS TO DO THAT WITH. SHOWING THAT- THAT THERE'S A TRUE PUBLIC SAFETY CONNECTION WITH THAT. THANK YOU TO A QUESTIONS SO. THE OTHER FOR AND ASK WE ARE. ARE BY SHERRY THE ISSUE THE COW. NAME COUNTY IN THIS WAS POINTED OUT WE ARE ACTUALLY. AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS ACTING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO THE COUNTIES BOTH FOR. A FACILITY UPGRADES AND FOR- OPERATIONS. AND THE IN SOME CASES THE COUNTIES HAVE NOT YET SPENT THE MONEY THAT THEY WERE GRANTED. AND IN OTHER CASES YOU KNOW HAVEN'T YET APPLY. BUT LET SAID THAT ASIDE FOR A MINUTE. WHAT BEEN BROUGHT UP THE- CAN BE AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT DETAIL YET BUT WE CAN WHEN WE HAVE OUR ME WILL A CHART ON THIS THERE'S A TO. BETWEEN THE OUR PROPORTION OF POPULATION THAT INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES ARE SENDING TO STATE PRISON IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE SOME OF OUR SMALLER COUNTIES ARE SENDING A MUCH LARGER PERCENT OF THEIR POPULATION TO STATE PRISON. THEN IN THEN REALIGNMENT EITHER BY HOW THEY'RE CHARGING OR SO IN OTHER WORDS NOT HOLDING THEM IN THEIR COUNTY JAILS WHICH OF COURSE IS A POPULATION PRESSURE FOR OUR STATE PRISONS SO WHAT- STRATEGIES MIGHT WE USE TO YOU KNOW HELP A DISINCENTIVE VICE. THE ALLOWING OF THE PRISON POPULATION TO POTENTIALLY BE TERM DETERMINED BY LOCAL DECISIONS. CHOOSE A WORD WITH AND OFF ARM ARE OFFICE RECENT RELEASED A REPORT AND- THE GOVERNOR'S PROBATION PROPOSALS. THAT REPRESENTS THE SORT OF- SOME STRATEGIES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS EMPLOYING TO TRY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION. FROM COMING TO PRISON AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK WOULD BE A- STRONG ALTERNATIVE TO THE ONES PRESENTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IS ADJUSTING V. SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT FORMULA TO REWARD COUNTIES FOR PREVENTING MISDEMEANOR PROBATIONERS FROM COMING TO PRISON SO IS YOUR CALL SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT IT SHARES A PORTION OF THE STATE SAVINGS THAT'S CREATED WHEN COUNTIES REDUCE THE RATE AT WHICH FALLON'S ON. EIGHTY SUPERVISION ARE SO PRISON AND SO FROM HARPER. ONE OPTION THAT THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER IS MODIFYING THAT FOR A FORMULA TO REWARD THEM FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF- FOLKS ON MISDEMEANOR PROBATION THAT COME TO PRISON SO REALLY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE TRAINING INCENTIVES RIGHT FOR THE COUNTIES IS A- CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS ADDRESS SOME OF THE- ISSUES. THANK I'M BY AT MY SUBCOMMITTEE WILL GIVE INTO THIS IN MAYBE THERE'S A ELSE THE PAN ONCE TO ON THE GUY WANTS TO ASK BUT- GIVEN THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE ONE. RISING PORSCHE OF THE CDC BUDGET. ONE QUESTION OF OUR- CUSTINE TONY OF ME NOW I'M JUST. YOUR IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL GET INTO DETAIL WHETHER WE'RE BEING ABLE. TO ACCESS CAL FOR THOSE POPULATIONS WE CAN'T ACCESS MEDI CAL. WHEN A PERSON IS INCARCERATED IN THE STATE FACILITY BUT- AND- WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR- OF THOSE FOLKS. IF THEY WERE UNDER MEDI CAL TREATMENT IT WOULD REDUCE OUR COSTS A GREAT DEAL BUT SO MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO GET INTO THAT I JUST RAISING IT BECAUSE IT IS A GOING TO BE AN ONGOING. ISSUE BUT MY FINAL QUESTION IS. SO WE'VE A LOT ABOUT POPULATION REDUCTION WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT- HOW PARTY FOR PURPOSE OF POPULATION. SO BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY ALMOST EVERYBODY IN PRISON NOT ALL BUT ALMOST IS GOING TO GO HOME. AND SO. WE IN IN REDUCING THE POPULATION BUT ALSO PREPARING PEOPLE TO GO HOME WE WANT TO DO THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE WE WANT GOOD PUBLIC SAFETY. IT SO I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY HAVE ONE. TO HAVE SOME OF OUR PANELISTS FROM LAST PANEL SHEER BUT ANYONE. CAN IS WHAT. WHAT ARE WHAT WOULD BE THE KEY ADVICE. IN A MISTER JOHNSON IF YOU HAVE A THAT WOULD BE GREAT IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY HELP PEOPLE REENTER FROM PRISON. AND BEFORE YOU ANSWER. WE HEARD YESTERDAY IN THE STATE OF THE STATE THE GOVERNOR TALK ABOUT ARE HOMELESS POPULATION IN OUR FOLKS THAT ARE HOUSING AND SECURE. AND NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING IN MORE DETAIL AT THE POINT OF COUNT WE ARE SEEING THAT A LARGE PERCENT ARE PEOPLE WITH RECORDS PEOPLE THAT WERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED. AND IN THE REPORT THAT WE HAVE FROM THE BUDGET STAFF THE DETAIL. ALL HOW CALIFORNIA. HAS SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT SOME OF THE MOST ELABORATE EITHER LICENSING PROCEDURES ARE COSTS FOR LICENSE HERE ALL THESE THINGS AROUND EMPLOYMENT. THAT BEYOND THE FACT THAT WE LIMIT ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WITH A FORMER PHONY CONVICTION FROM ALL THESE CATEGORIES EMPLOYMENT WE ALSO MAKE THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR EMPLOYMENT. ARE REALLY HIGH AND- SO ANYWAY THAT THAT'S A KIND OF COMPLICATED BUT- WHAT. WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING TO. BETTER PREPARE AND EIGHT WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR US. FOR ME- WAS SAID LIKE DEFENDER MENTOR PROGRAM NAY WITH GUYS BE LIKE WORK IN TRYING TO GET A CERT WHAT INCARCERATED- ONE THING I WANTED. TO WOULD USE AN EARLY IS COST EFFECTIVE PEOPLE WE HAVE THE BILL AT TO TAKE MEDICATION I'M JUST TELLING YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. I BECAME A VEGAN TO TWO YEARS AGO- WITH A DIABETIC AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE I HAD THOSE WHO HAD OPENED JUST ABOUT WE INSTEAD OF THE- MARK THE RIDER'S. TAKE MEDICATION BUT THE WRITERS ANYTHING BECAUSE WAITED HE DO LOW EXERCISE AND I DRINK PLENTY OF WATER YOU KNOW TO BE COST EFFECTIVE WE STORE TO YOU PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY BEFORE YOU GET OUT STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE- OF THEM WHEN I FIRST CAME HOME I WENT TO HAS GET UP NAY THE DON'T NEED. IT AND I WAS LIKE BECAUSE HEART ATTACK IN I'M HAD ANOTHER HEARTED BECAUSE WITH THE IS LIKE THAT FOR OF MY LIFE WE NEED EACH ALIVE AND WITH TO BECAUSE MAKE THIS HELP THE MAKE BETTER TO. LIKE THAT WOULD. SET UP A PRO. REALLY WANT TO WORK IT. NO IS NO HUNDRED. DANGER GOING TO WORK IN. GOT IT IN IN THIS. PEOPLE TOLD ME TWENTY YOU AGO MORE SEVERE BETWEEN YEARS AGO AND AM. LAST YEAR REMEMBER. HOST OF TO ONCE. IF WE GET PEOPLE TO LIKE TO SOME KIND FOR SO DIFFERENT WAY BELIEVE. CHANGES IN THE CITY PEOPLE DID KNOW WHAT TO YOUR ME COME BACK IN A SEE I A LITTLE OUT HE- KURT. BECAUSE ENCOURAGE WE'RE GO A LONG WAY MISTER YOU SEE LIKE I WAS DEEP. TWO EIGHT. FOUR THIRTY TWO YEARS NOW PEOPLE COME OWES A MISTER. YOU KNOW IN. MAKES WHEN YOU GET. WHEN YOU START. YOURSELF OTHER P. RISK YOU BECAUSE OF PEOPLE RESPECT THE SET UP THEY'VE BEEN BE DEBT BEFORE YOU CAME TO PRISON. THE REAL THE WOUNDED DUCK BE WHEN WE GOT. TO PUT UP A MASSIVE STAY STRONG OF LATE IT'S A SHE'S DEFACING. OF BEING DID YOU DURING YOUR LIFE CHECK BECAUSE- YOU KNOW AS WOODS FOR TWO OF THE- BELIEVE IN COLOGNE PEOPLE. FOR LEAVE A MESSAGE. TO WE TWENTY IS GO YOU BE WHEN A SUIT. ABOUT TODAY AND I CAN SEE IF WE HEREI AM TODAY. IT'S SO IF WE WILL. IN CURSE. TO BECAUSE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DIS NIGHT ONE. REMAINING BE MP. IN EVERY COULD LOOK AT. FOR ME I'LL FOR TO GO PEOPLE TODAY. YOU KNOW AND WAS YOU KNOW YOU SEE. WE'RE TO GO A LONG WAY FOR DATING. YOU KNOW WE PEOPLE STILL HEARD. WITH CAN STILL OCCUR BE AND BILLY IN THE AND IN A- IN THE- OF NEW TO GO TO THE NECK PERSON. THEN YOU KNOW. I BE. MAKE TWENTY TWO YEARS A I WOULDN'T WANT ME TO LIVE NEXT TO US. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. BUT I. WOULD TODAY I I'M- YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW. I'M JUST SAYING BECAUSE BELIEVE YOU MAKE. ME AND MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE SENATOR BECAUSE OF NOT PERSON IS EVERY. IS FOR. WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOME LIKE. YOU KNOW FROM WHICH SAID TODAY IN HIS CARE ON OUT HIS ROOM IN SOME OTHER GOING TO SOMETHING TO BE A- MAY IT POSSIBLE. IN HIS GO INNER TUBE. YOU KNOW OUR- APPRECIATE. BUT AS OF MAR FOR AND YOU KNOW OCCURRED GOING TO PRESENT IT TO DO ALL. PRO IN THIS WHERE SAID. WHEN YOU HAVE CREDIBLE WILL MODELS TO PRISON. IF PEOPLE GOING TO FOR THE RIGHT THING. GIVEN THE ARE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. P. NAY BY ENDED A NEW NAY. THE BECAUSE THEY BEGIN. AT HOLD. IT IS WITH HIS MOM LIKE A SAID HOPE TO KEEP. FAT ME WE GET BE. CHANGE BECAUSE- IN THIS WICKER. CATCH THAT AS WELL KNOWN THANK YOU WAS I THINK HAVE AN CAPACITY IN pQUESTION WE TO PEOPLE HOME IF RELEASE PEOPLE IT THERE MAY WILL. MENTALLY ILL ELDERLY WHY POPULAR WASN'T UP THAT INCREASE IN IN CAR WHEN AND THE WIND AND CHILDREN TO WOMEN SO I THINK THE AND DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD AS WELL BUT THE COMMUNITY PASS CITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ABLE TO COORDINATE THOSE SERVICES WHEN TIME THE OFFENDER MENTOR CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IS GREAT WE HIRE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED THAT ARE NOW CERTIFIED TO PROVIDE THOSE TREATMENTS SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY TO EXPAND IN ON MANSION WITH HOUSING BUILDING CONSTRUCTION WE ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUE BY ALLOWING MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE FALLING. DOT BUILD UP MISS OF HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITYSO WE'RE OF INTO A AT ONE SOMETHING MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE LIKE FOR PER FOR. MEN AND WOMEN LIKE OZIL TO COME HOME TO FOR THE MEDICALLY VULNERABLE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PLAYED IN A COUNTY PARTNER LEVERAGE CHARACTERISES AND OTHER SERVER FOR IN TO GET INTO PERMANENT HOUSING FOR NATO YOU LOVE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS GONNA BE. AND BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE COUNTY. OR IN THE US LONG OUT THEIR OWN. THIRTY TO BE CLEVER. I WOULD AT THE- UNTIL WE- PRETTY DRASTICALLY TO OUR PER SYSTEM. THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A BETTER SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY DOING A LOT OF THE WORK- AND DOING KIND OF THE DEEPER WORK FOR PEOPLE IN PRISON WE NEEDTO MAKE SURE THERE'S CONTINUITY OF CARE. SO THAT THE WORK DOING INSIDE THEY GET TO CONTINUE WHEN FOLKS COME INTO THE COMMUNITY- BECAUSE THAT TRANSITION HOME. IS ONE THAT TAKES AN EMOTIONAL TOLL REQUIRES A LOT OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND THERE'S THIS ALMOST NONE OF THAT CERTAINLY NINE COMING FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT ROLE OPERATIONS- THERE'S NOT A COUNSELOR SOMEONE CAN GO TO TALK TO ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY BROKE DOWN CRYING A LITTLE TRAFFIC NOT SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT. CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT- BUT THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE STARTED BUILDING THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE WATER INSIDE- TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUPPORTED AND CONTINUE THAT WORK. ON THE OUTSIDE AGAIN THIS IS. GREEN BAY'S ORGANIZATION SHOULDN'T BE BE FOR EVER SOLUTION. BUT AS I SAID UNTIL THE PRISON POPULATION AND COMMUNITY AND SYSTEM IS DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORMED. WE PLAY A PRETTY VITAL ROLE- AND HELPING PEOPLE MAKE THAT TRANSITION. SO A COUPLE YEARS AGO OUR OFFICE RELEASED A PORT ON THE LOOKING AT WAYS THE STATE COULD IMPROVE IN PRISON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS I THINK THIS WILL BOTH BOTH TOUCH ON YOUR QUESTION IN SOME OF YOUR EARLIER QUESTIONS ARE SENATOR NIELSEN- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK IS REALLY CRITICAL IS. THAT WE THAT WE REQUIRE THAT PROGRAMS BE EVIDENCE BASED NATURALLY A TWO STEP PROCESS FIRST AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CDC ARE HAS AN ODD DEFINITELY IMPROVED IN RECENT YEARS TO CHOOSE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE ELSEWHERE. BUT THE SECOND AND GOAL STEP IN THAT PROCESS IS ENSURING THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CHOOSE OUR ACTUALLY BE OPERATED IN A WAY THAT SIMILAR TO THE WAY THEY WERE. AMENDED OUT WHERE THIS CALLED A FIDELITY ASSESS AND CITIES HERE IS IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO BEGAN. THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING FIDELITY ASSESSMENTS. WE ALSO THINK THOUGH THAT BEYOND THAT IT'S CALLED ACTUALLY LOOK AT IN THE WAY THAT THE ORDER DID WITH RESPECT TO SOME CDC OUR PROGRAMS. THE ACTUAL STATISTICAL FACT ON INMATES THAT ARE IN THE PROGRAMS BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE A PROGRAM WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE WE NEED THE ISSUE BUT IT ALSO IN HERE SO THAT FITS NOT INTO A LOOK AT HER FIGURE HOW. RAM COULD BE MY THEY'RE NOT OTHER PROGRAM WOULD BE MORE OF. THE THING. IS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PROGRAMS HIGHER HIGH INMATES THE OF WAY TO REHABILITATED PROGRAM AND WILL CDC OURS RIGHT. ARE PUT IN PLACE TO TRY TO IN THIS IN MANY THE BREAKS THE AND SO WE THINK VARIOUS WAY THAT THIS COULD AND A ENSURING HIRING HIGH NEED I AT GET IN PRO IN OUR FOR IT WE ALSO THING THAT IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE STATE TAKE A LOOK AT ITS INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE IT ACTUALLY HAS THE CAPACITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF HIGH RISK HIGH NEED INMATES RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT CLEAR IF WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE SPACE AVAILABLE TO MEET EVERYONE'S NEEDS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF ADDING ABOUT EITHER AS A- ASSIST. ATTIC ASSESSED WHAT. BE B. AND OF CLASSROOMS. AND TREATMENTS BY NOW. TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS OLD NEEDS THAT GO ON MATT AND THEN FOR. WE ALSO THINK THAT THE STATE COULD IMPROVE BY AND- IMPLEMENTING- PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO SORT OF CONDUCT REGULAR OVERSIGHT OVER PROGRAMS A LOT OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATIONS CAN TAKE YEARS TO DO AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO. SORT OF MAINTAIN CONSTANT OVERSIGHT OVER THE PROGRAMS AND I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEMBERS HAVE A COPY OF THIS REPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE CAN MOVE ON TO. DOCTOR PAN I THINK WHO LIVE THAT WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT MEDI CAL BEING OUT TAPPED INTO- CENTER SKINNER SO I'M SURE HE'S GOING TO TAKE US THERE FOLLOWING DOCTOR PANT WILL BE SENATOR BAIL DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AS CHAIR AND- A NOTE THAT- STRICTLY RAISED AND- QUESTIONS ABOUT- WHAT'S TRADING OR INCREASED COSTS- HEALTHCARE CAME- WAS SPECIFICALLY REFERENCES THE FIRST ITEM. SO IT IS SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS- MORE BROADLY IS A WHAT KIND OF PROPOSALS AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S GONNA BE DIGGING INTO MATTERS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE BUT SINCE I CHAIRED THE MEDI CAL SIDE OF THINGS- WHAT KIND OF THINGS WILL BE LOOKING AT TO TRY TO BEND THE CURVE ON SPENDING ON THE- HEALTH. CARE THAT I KNOW THAT SOME OF ITS HUNDRED RECEIVERSHIP- AND THAT'S YEAH. BUT I GUESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WOULD BE ONE IS THAT-IF THERE'S A WAY TO YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM ON MEDI CAL WHEN THEY'RE INCARCERATED BUT- IT'S OUR SPEAKS TO OKAY WELL WHAT ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT TWENTY YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MCCARTY STRAIGHT BUTTON SO THE FACILITY WHERE YOU CAN GET CARE RIGHT- POTENTIALLY OR- I GUESS THE OTHER THING IS THAT GIVEN. THE CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE POPULATION I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE AT LEAST FOR RIGHT NOW AND PROBABLY THE PEOPLE COMING IN OR NOT THAT THE OLDER AND AS PRIDE THE YOUNGER AND- A WHAT IS PROJECTION. ON THE CURVE ON OF WHERE THE HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE GOING TO GO- GIVEN WHAT YOU KNOW NOW SO DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT CURVE LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF. WHEN WE START THINKING ABOUT HOW YEARS. AND THEN FINALLY. IT WITH THE ONE GOALS IS TO CLOSE A STATE PRISON OR- AND- AND FIVE YEARS AND- WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF YOU KNOW ALSO. THE FACILITIES WERE CONTRACTING OUT SO FORTH- BUT- IS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT LIKE. YES IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY ALSO. NON LINEAR CELL RIGHT SO I GUESS WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IN THE SAME WAY WE TALK ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW ACTUALLY. EVEN THOUGH OUR PRISONER. RATES GOING DOWN- YOU KNOW THE COST IS INDUSTRY GOING DOWN SOME BECAUSE OF PROGRAMMING BUT SOME OF THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN INFRASTRUCTURES UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY CLOSE A FACILITY. YOU WON'T SEE A SAVINGS. FROM THAT BECAUSE OF SPECIALLY HAS MEETING A CERTAIN AMOUNT. DOES THAT ALSO APPLY TO THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SIDE OF THINGS AS WELL SO WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. COSTS IN TERMS OF. HEALTH CARE FOR PRISONERS. AND NUMBER PRISONERS IS IT. IS IT IS IT. IS IT A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP ARE IS IT NOT AND IT'S ACTUALLY WE CLOSE OF SILLY WILL. BE ON THE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO. NINE DOCTORS AND NURSES. WHO HAVE TO GO OUT SYSTEM THE PENNY ON. THE AND ARE YOU TO HAVE THE ANY ON LOCATION OF SILLY. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO AT. PEOPLE WHO IS A RECRUIT FOR. HIM AS MUCH OR WHATEVER ELSE I DON'T IT. SO I HAVE PEOPLE IN THE- WELL. EXACTLY SO YES THERE'S I'D SO WITH THERE A WAY TO GET. ON TO YOU KNOW OUR OF THIS. PRESENTS THE MEDIC WHAT THE LOOKING AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS WHAT'S THE- ON HEALTH CARE AND- WHAT IT OPERA. AND IS REALLY BETWEEN PRISONERS. OBVIOUSLY JUSTIN FOR ASIAN SOME OTHER THINGS RELATE HEALTH CONDITIONS AND ARE SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM. SO I COULD TAKE A- STAB AT. UNPACKING SOME OF THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A COME A FEW POINTS THERE SO- LET ME JUST START WITH- ADD YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. THE INCREASING COST HER FOR HEALTH CARE- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT IS A GROWING AREA OF EXPENDITURE FOR US- AND IT IS ONE IN WHICH- WE DO HAVE- AS AN ADMINISTRATION LIMITED CONTROL BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL RECEIVERSHIP OVER- PRISON MEDICAL CARE- I THINK WHAT'S- REALLY UNDERLYING SOME OF THESE INCREASES IS THE- THE AGING POPULATION THAT WE HAVE- AND- IN THIS KIND OF GETS TO CENTER SKINNER'S QUESTION FROM. EARLIER AS WELL- THE ELSE IN THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO HERE THE ANSWER NOW. SURE IN I THINK. THE PERSON POP IS AGING IS IN PART BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE UPTAKE THAT THAT WE HAD IN SENTENCE LANES GOING BACK DECADES REALLY AND TO THE IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHEN WE STARTED- SORT TOUGHER ON TOUGH ON CRIME POLICIES LIKE THREE STRIKES LAW I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS REALLY THE TAIL END OF THAT- AND BECAUSE IT TOOK US A DECADE TO GET INTO THE SITUATION I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY SOLUTIONS TO GET OUT. OVER NIGHT UNFORTUNATELY- SO I THINK- THE AS AS WAS NOTED EARLIER BY SOME OF THE PANELISTS I THINK THE DECISIONS AROUND PAROLE AND MAKING SURE THAT- GIVING PEOPLE ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION FOR PAROLE- WILL HELP OVER TIME TO REDUCE- SOME OF THE AGING IN THE PRISON POPULATION AND HAVING FOLKS GO OUT THE BACK DOOR. I'M YOUR CALL ABOUT UTILIZING CAL SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY- DONE I THINK A VERY GOOD JOB OF UTILIZING MEDI CAL FOR OUTPATIENT SERVICES SO WHEN WE SEND AN INMATE. OUT TO A HOSPITAL FOR- INPATIENT CARE LASTING TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR MORE. WE CAN CLAIM MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT TREATMENT BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED AN INMATE ANY LONGER BECAUSE THEY'RE OFF OF THE PRISON GROUNDS- THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO THAT OF COURSE- YOU KNOW I THINK. FOR OUTPATIENT SERVICES WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CLAIM REIMBURSEMENT UNDER MEDICO- WE HAVE LOOKED AT- USING MEDI CAL FOR OUR- INMATES THAT WERE HOLDING AND THE- REENTRY FACILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY. WHICH ARE SORT OF OUR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FACILITIES- UNFORTUNATELY THE DETERMINATION FROM- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WAS THAT THE INMATES. WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BECAUSE- I THINK THAT THE KEY CRITERIA THAT LOOK AT THIS THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT- AND BECAUSE OF THE- SECURITY- CONCERNS AROUND THOSE FACILITIES THAT THOSE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL UNDER THE CUSTODY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND WE HAVE TO- ENSURE THE COMMUNITY BUT THERE ARE. IN UPSET FROM THE SOME RISK IS ABOUT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND SO. WE NEED TO BALANCE THAT WITH THINK ABOUT THE CAR SAVINGS OF. WHILE AND THEN. WE'RE QUESTION THIS WILL BE A THIRTY THE HEALTH KERR ACOSTA CURVE ON. ALLUDED TO THE THAT NO IT IS IT IS NOW LINEAR SO AS WE CALL THE STATE PRISON IT'S NOT GOING TO RELATE TO A YOU KNOW PER. DECLINE IN HEALTH CARE. NAKED GETS BY TO WHO ARE THE WHO ARE DRIVING THE HEALTHCARE COSTS IT'S THE AGING FOLKS IN AND IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SEE IN THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF. A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR AND IT'S A REALLY DEPRIVING THE MAJORITY OF THE COST AND SO UNTIL WE KIND OF GET AT THAT ISSUE- THE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT SIGNIFICANTLY BEND THE COST CURVE. AND JUST REACH- ANY OF THESE PRISONERS SOLD ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING NURSING HOME CARE FOR THEM WITHIN THE PRISON. I IT DOES. OF A CAR ON K. A IN ON THE CAL HEALTH CARE FACILITY IN STOCKTON WE HAVE- ESSENTIALLY SKILLED NURSING CARE LEVEL- BEDS THERE SO- IN ESSENCE YES I THINK THERE ARE SOME SOME NUMBER OF BEDS THAT THAT'S THE CASE. WE ALSO HAVE HOSPICE BEDS THAT. CALIFORNIA MEN'S FACILITY VACAVILLE- OF SORRY I KNOW YOU TALKED TO BE IN THAT. YEAH I THINK FOR THE RECORD WE FACTOR TALKING THE MICROPHONE BUT- SORRY. I WILL BE OFFENDED THAT YOUR TALK TO MICHAEL A LITTLE. BEYOND THAT CENTER PAN IS A- THE PART AT WITH IT HEALTH CARE SO. AND THERE'S OFF WE HAVE ELIMINATED- THE REQUIREMENT OF COPAYS FOR INMATES SO IT DOES NOT DISCOURAGE INMATES SEEKING ACCESS TO OUR- AND I ALSO NEED TO SAY JUST FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE THE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. IS MORE OF AN OPERATIONAL DECISION NOW THAT WE HAVE MADE THAT AMENDED MANDATE AND THAT IS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE I KNOW SAFETY SECURITIES. IN A PARAMOUNT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENTS- THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT- WE HAVE DRASTICALLY MINIMIZE WERE ALMOST ELIMINATED BECAUSE THAT IS A PRIORITY- AND ONE WOULD THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING HAPPENS ON A PRISON YARD. EVERYTHING IS SHUT DOWN AND CLEAN HEALTHCARE THAT'S NOT THE CASE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO GET THESE IMAGE TO THEIR HEALTHCARE SERVICES- TO A MISTER JOHNSON'S POINT AND IT'S- IT'S REALLY BASIC- WHAT WE FEED IN MAKES. HOW FRIEDMAN. THE LEVEL OF THE SEE. WE HAVE IMPROVE AND WE ARE SERVING A HARD HEALTHY. IT IS NOT THE MOST POPULAR. AT THE END POPULAR. BUT I WE DID OUR TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FOR OUR BEHIND GREAT. AND YOU KNOW MANY OF SUITES WE USED PROVIDE DO PROVIDE SWEETS PASSED OUT AT THE WE READ. THAT IT'S THIS A DIRECT CALL. JIM THEY EAT. AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE CHALLENGE POINT IS- WE ARE ESTABLISHED SEEN THE HEART HEALTHY CANTEEN ITEMS WHICH IS. INMATES ON THEIR OWN CAN GO BY. MISS NO DIFFERENT TO ME WHEN I GO I HAVE TO GO WITH MY WIFE SO SHE COULD MAKE MY SNACKS. BY WHEN IT'LL BE A DIFFERENT SET OF SNACKS. BATES ARE ALSO THE SAME WE TO PROVIDE. LOW SODIUM HOW TO PROVIDE A HEART HEALTHY OPTION FOR THEM. A WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT WE WITHIN THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS ON A RECENT TRIP TO NORWAY. THAT WAS A CONCEPT OVER THERE THAT- ALL HEART HEALTHY CANTEEN ITEMS ARE SOLD TO THE INMATES AT COST WITH EVERY PURCHASE THEM AND THEN. ANY ON HEART HEALTHY OR ANY ON HEALTHY ITEM THERE IS A MARK UP ON THOSE- WE ARE. CONSIDERING THAT THIS MORE FOR THE DIRECTOR OF ANOTHER ADULT OPERATIONS BUT THAT'S AN OPTION- I KNOW IT WILL GOAL IT MY NUMBER. THE MOST POPULAR THING BUT WE HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND THEN LASTLY WE- IMPLEMENTED. SOME YEARS AGO- IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE OUR STDS AND INSTITUTIONS WE DID- WE DID IMPLEMENT A CONDOM- PROGRAM INSTEAD OF INSTITUTIONS RIGHT. SELECT A JUST JUST ON A BIT AND OF YOUR- OF HOW TO REDUCE MISTER. IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT APARTMENT DOES DRAW DOWN SOME MEDI CAL HOWEVER WE'VE BEEN MONITORING THE RATE AT WHICH THE DEPARTMENT IS I'M TRYING DOWN MEDICAL AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO LINE UP IN THE WAY WE WOULD HOPE. WITH THE LEVEL OF- INPATIENT SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED IN THE COMMUNITY WE HAVE NOT ARRIVED AT- IDENTIFICATION OF WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE TO INCREASING IT OR INDEED IF IT COULD BE INCREASED SO RIGHT NOW. THE ON ADMINISTRATION IS REQUESTING- SOME FUNDING TO SUPPORT CONTRACT MEDICAL SERVICES WHICH INCLUDE THESE TYPE OF SERVICES. AND SO WE'RE WITHHOLDING RECOMMENDATION ON THAT- WELL WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO INCREASE THAT AMOUNT OR IF THERE ARE BARRIERS THAT CAN BE REMOVED TO TRY TO INCREASE THAT AMOUNT. IN TERMS OF- YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHERE WILL THE COSCO- GIVEN THAT WERE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE RECEIVERSHIP AND ONLY ROUGHLY A DOZEN- ON INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN DELEGATED SO ESSENTIALLY THE PROCESS OF GETTING OUT OF THE RECEIVERSHIP. REQUIRES THE RECEIVER DELHI EIGHT. BILLION SO. THAT KERN. ON CAN BY RECEIVER. TWITCHES KERN ROD IT OR SO OKAY AS PART IF YOU ARE. ON A THEN ALSO. ANY OF THE- THAT THE RECEIVERS HAS TAKE IN CAN. ARMS WE'RE STILL SO OF. A DID TO ESTIMATE WE THAT WILL. BUT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE DELEGATION OF ALL OF THOSE AND SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT COST COULD INCREASE HOWEVER. BOB THERE IS. THERE IS A SIGNATURE CHANGE IN THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION. IT COULD OF THE M. OF CA THAT THE STATE IS FOR. BUT I WOULD SAY THEY'RE SORT OF. MORE UPSET AND RISK THAN THERE IS. A LIKELIHOOD OF REDUCTION IN COST. ENTER OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE RADIO HEALTH CARE STE I THINK IT IS FOR TO SAY THEY ARE ARE NOT. REAL WITH INMATES. FOR CA REASONS ONE BECAUSE OF THE FIX COSTS. FOR WE INVEST IN THE UC. HEALTH CARE FACILITY WHICH WAS A MAJOR EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS TO CREATE A LARGE- HOSPITAL LIKE SETTING FOR INMATES BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS WHITE PROP THIRTY SIX MANY OF THE SENTENCING CHANGES HAVE REALLY AFFECTED SHORTER TERM INMATES- AND SO THERE'S SORT OF A DISPROPORTIONATELY LESS LIKELY TO AFFECT THE- LONG TERM MORE- THE END MEETS WERE AGING AND CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH CARE COST IS PROPORTIONALLY SO IT'S ALSO. SEE WHAT NON LINEAR BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP WELL. I GUESS WE SAY THE BOTTOM OF A THROW AWAY THE KEY THEN WE'RE PAYING FOR ALL OF IT. YEAH OKAY. BUT THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS I IT LOOKS. TO YOU KNOW I'M SURE OF PRESENTED MORE BUT WHICH FOLLOW ALONG. AND SEEING WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT I GUESS THE ONE OTHER MAYBE FOR IF I MAY JUST ONE BRIEF SO. WE TALK ABOUT RECEIVERSHIP AND WE HAVE THE YOU KNOW WITH EACH FACILITY BUT I. PRESUME AND LESS WE THINK RECEIVERS FOR THE SPENDING LOTS OF EXTRA MONEY THAT THE SPENDING ONCE THEY'VE SILLY MOVES OUT OF RECEIVERSHIP STILL STAYS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME ADJUSTED FOR OF NUMBER OF. IS IN AGENTS FORTH THAT THAT THAT THAT THE RETURN. THREE EIGHTY NINE. WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING EIGHT. DROP INS HEALTHCARE SPENDING JUST BECAUSE OF GOES OUT A PURSE RECEIVERSHIP RIGHT I MEAN IT'S VERY REASON WE ENDED UP IN RECEIVERSHIP EXCELLENT DOING THE RIGHT THING CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE'D BE A SOMEWHAT MINOR REDUCTION BECAUSE IN SOME CASES THERE'S SORT OF A DUPLICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE MIGHT HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS THAT. WE WOULD LACK THAT ABILITY BUT ON THE WHOLE THERE SHOULD YOU USE YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO SEE A LARGE REDUCTION IN THE AND HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES- BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING ONCE WE SUCCESSFULLY- EXIT THE RECEIVERSHIP. THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTERVILLE. REGARDING THE HEALTH OF FUNDING I JUST SAID THE CHAIRS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTWHICH SAYS THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK GRANT FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK GRANT CAN BE USE FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. SO I THINK WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE NEW FEDERAL. A RULE AND HOW THEY VIEW FUNDING PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RE ENTRY FACILITIES TO SEE IF WE COULD. INCLUDE THAT NEW POLICY IN OUR APPROACH TO FUNDING- MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS- WITH MEDICAID FUNDS AND OTHER. FEDERAL. HEALTHCARE FUNDS SO AND I LEAVE IT TO DOCTOR PLAN DO- EXAMINE THAT CLOSELY IN HIS COMMITTEE BUT BUT I THINK- IT'S VERY IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT. DIRECTION THAT ARE NOW TAKING THEIR NOW SAYING. YOU COULD TAKE THE MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK GRANT AND USE IT FOR FEDERAL FUNDS. OF WE HAVE A CHART FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT. WHO LISTING THE INMATE POPULATION- I WOULD LIKE ALL OF US TO LOOK AT THIS IS THE BASE CASE THAT WE'RE STARTING WITH NOW. OKAY IS THE BASE CASE SO WE WANT TO SEE WHAT STRATEGIES- AT ACTIVITIES WE CAN PROPOSE- THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS- TO. REDUCE THE POPULATION. OF LEVELS IN OUR STATE PRISON OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I THINK THE- THE STRATEGIES- IN THE OPTIONS. OF WE NEED TO LOOK AT WERE TALKED ABOUT LARGE A LOT TODAY- I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT THE NEW DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE. IN TERMS OF HOME LOS. FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE THERE A LOT OF ROOM CAN WE- SOMEHOW PUT THEM BACK INTO HOUSING. OF WILL PUTTING THEM BACK IN A HOUSING REDUCE CRIME IN THE COMMUNITY WILL REDUCE SO. THE HEALTHCARE COSTS OF PEOPLE BY HOUSING THOSE PEOPLE WOULD- PROVIDE A BETTER FOR THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM. AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THOSE OPTIONS THAT WE CAN CONSIDER. TO REDUCE INCARCERATION I LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT THE RE ENTRY- BEDS. AND IN THE IN THE CHART AND I SEE WILL IS. OUR POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING THAT THAT'S A TO BE. KIND OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR WAS ABOUT I CALLED SUPPORT OF HOUSING. HOUSING WAS SUPPORT SYSTEMS- THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE. I THINK SEARCH SO. MR WIDELY BOND IN THE JOHNSON HERE I LIKE TO ASK THEM. IF YOU USE THIS IS THE BASE CASE WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE STATE'S MOST IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS ARE. OF FOUR OF THAT WE TAKE IN REGARDS TO. PEOPLE THAT ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED- WHAT KIND OF STEPS DO WE TAKE. THE NOW THAT YOU KNOW ARE PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE- AND- SUCH ABUSE TREATMENT IS A SPECIAL SPECIAL INTEREST OF MINE I VISITED THE DOMINANT FRIZZ. YOUR MATCHING DIAMOND I WITH DOWN THERE AND HAD A NICE ENJOYABLE TIME WITH THE STAFF IN THE- INMATES AND WE SAW HOW THEY HAD A- RE ENTRY PROGRAM THERE THAT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE IN FINDING JOBS FOR PEOPLE ONCE THEY LEFT DONOVAN. AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WE TALKED ABOUT THE JOB PLACEMENTS IN THE TRAINING AND SO FORTH- I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THAT AND I ALSO VISITED THE- CORRECTIONS FACILITY IN A CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOR WOMEN. AND I FOUND THAT MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE SUCH A ROBUST JOB TRAINING. PROGRAMS THAT MAYBE WOULD BE RELEVANT I MEAN THEY HAD SOME JOBS JOBS IN THE PRISON MAKING FLAGS AND- NO DENTAL APERTURES AND OTHER THINGS BUT- HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THOSE PROGRAMS TO MAKE THEM RELEVANT TO PEOPLE. IN PLACEMENT OF JOBS AFTER THEY LEAVE PRISON SO THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS MAYBE PERHAPS YOU CAN START YOUR YOUR- DIALOGUE ON MY PRINT MY PURPOSES THIS IS THE BASE CASE WHICH IS START HERE AND WE SAID OKAY LET'S GET TO STRATEGIES ALL TOGETHER IN. THE NEXT FEW MONTHS- LET'S COME UP WITH SOME- ANSWERS DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS I'D SAY MY COMMENTS OF THE- KIND OF BRIEF THIS SIX BECAUSE- I THINK THAT A LOT OF MYSTERIES AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. A LOT OF- MISMATCH IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMMATIC OFFERINGS IN THE INSTITUTIONS. AND WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED AND AS YOU MENTIONED PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO WERE RETURNING FROM PRISON I THINK. ON THE FRONT END PEOPLE COME IN AND WE NEED A BETTER SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE WHAT THEY NEED. IS SO THAT WE CAN PRESCRIBE. A PROGRAM THAT WILL ACTUALLY SUPPORT THEM ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS AND WHEN THEY GO HOME. WHAT NEEDS TO REMAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WHILE THEY'RE ON PAROLE OR AND OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT THEY GET THE KIND OF SUPPORT. THEY NEED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO COUNSELING THERAPY I THINK ONE THING THAT CAN REALLY HELP ME AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT A TO THE- THE POINT THAT YOU RAISED ABOUT. WHAT YOU SAW WHEN YOU WENT TO THE INSTITUTIONS. I THINK THAT. THAT PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO GET INTO THE PRISONS. YOU NEED TO SEE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE BY THE TWENTY SIX NOW I THINK. I'LL I'LL BET MOST PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN TWENTY SIX- BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S PEOPLE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. OUR BE TRUE ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED WHAT THEY NEED. IF YOU PROVIDE A SAFE SPACE THEY WILL SHARE THAT WITH YOU. AND THEN THEN HAVE THE DRIVER POLICY. INSTEAD OF CREATE A POLICY AND SAY HEY WE'RE GIVING YOU WHAT WE THINK YOU PROBABLY NEED AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG MISSING PIECE I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT COULD BE CAN BE GLEANED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF GENDER BASED VIOLENCE. THERE IS SUCH A GREAT NEED OF SPACE TO TALK ABOUT IT. ASK FOR WHAT THEY NEED THAT WOULD REALLY INFORM A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS GOING FORWARD I THINK IN THAT THAT JUST MEANS GOING TO THE INSTITUTION LISTING. HAVING AN INFORMATIONAL. MEETINGS AND HEARINGS IN THE INSTITUTIONS SPECIAL THE WOMAN'S PRESENCE AGAIN TELL YOU A LOT. ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE TO DO THAT IF WOMEN'S PRESENTING- FLOOR REALLY IMPORTANT A LONG LIST OF THINGS THEY- WHEN THE OFFICE. DECADE YEAH FIVE THIRTY BY THE WOMEN'S KERR A WE HAVE ATTEMPTED. A CLOSED GAP ON IN TERMS OF. AMONG OUR COLLEAGUES THE ISSUES AROUND EQUITY- AND CHALLENGES INCARCERATED WOMEN HAVE EXERIENCE IN THE STATE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND SO. MANY OF US DO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT YEAH THEY ALSO ONE MORE WOMEN- FOX STAFF YEAH YEAH IN FACT WOMEN'S FACILITIES SEC LAKES IN ONE OF THE RESPONSE THANK YOU AND I AGREE ON GROUP'S KEYS COMMENTS CERTAINLY WITH WOMEN'S- VISIT IN DATA WOMEN'S PRISON LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THAN AN IMMENSE. SENSE OF SUPPORT FOR WOMEN AN INSTITUTION LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT AS WELL- AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THE COMMUNITY CAPACITY YOU TALK ABOUT MEN ALL SERVICES ACT CHANGE IN THAT WILL OPEN DOORS- AND LEVERAGE RESOURCES WELL A LOT OF THE HOUSE AND IT WAS BILL WITH IMAGES SAY DOLLARS DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE THAT ARE ON PAROLE TO LIVE IN THAT HOUSE IN. SO I THINK THAT WILL HELP AND MAKING SURE THAT A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PRISON COUPLED WITH AFTER CARE SERVICES AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES BUT FINALIZING THAT WITH HOUSING PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE ONCE THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS IT CAN'T JUST BE A SIX MONTH COMMITMENT THAT'S NOT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS FIGURE OUT. WORKING WITH LOCAL- AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY HOUSE THAT'S WHY LARGELY THE HOMELESS POPULATION IS FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND SO MAKING SURE THAT WE LEVERAGE DRUG MEDI CAL DOLLARS IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUTPATIENT SERVICES. THAT HELP US MAXIMIZE MORE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR THOSE THAT DON'T QUALIFY FOR THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THAT BECAUSE DRUG THE CAL ONE RETAIL BUT IT ALSO IN THE REGION STATE. OF HER ENTRY. JUST AN EMPTY PART AS WELL. INNER IN INSTITUTIONS. AND YOU TO DEVELOP SEE I WOULD KERN CAREERS MEAN. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED HAVE A LOT OF SKILLS. AND I NEVER GET THE CHANCE DISPLAYED A TALENT. WE DO WE DEVELOP WORKSOURCE CENTERS IN INSTITUTION THEY COME AND SEE AN NAY PREPARED I'M STILL BEFORE YOU EVEN LEAVE. IN A GOOD TRANSFERRED IT TO WHEN THEY GET OUT. IN THIS WILL WE DO WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH TRADE TECH AND ONE STUFF. IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS PVV FOR JOBS AND FOR DIFFERENT SKILLS GUYS WANT TO GO BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT GOD TO JUST GO WORK AND WE'RE I MEAN WAREHOUSE JOB TO GET IT. SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU HAVE A DEGREE IN IN A BID TO SKEW WHY YOU WANT TO SETTLE FOR WAREHOUSE. YOU KNOW. USUALLY TALENT TO BE DEVELOPING AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT YOU WON'T BECAUSE I ENJOY GOING TO WORK. YOU KNOW OUR SOON WITH THE YOUNG LADY OUTSIDE OUT EVERY DAY I DRIVE A HUNDRED MILES TO GO TO WORK. IN A ENJOY WHEN I GET DO BECAUSE- WHEN I'D BE ABLE TO COME TO SAY WE WANT TO MEAN THE NAY TIMOTHY GOT A JOB AND I GOT THE LIGHTS IT DID BRING JOY TO ME. IN A SEVERE BASIC THINGS GUYS ME WHEN THEY GET OUT OF PRISON NAY NEED A BIRTH CERTIFICATE A DRIVER LANCERS KITTY. GOING BEFORE WE COULD EVEN GET A JOB. SO WE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO GET THAT FOR THEIR BEFORE EVEN GO OUT AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND SOME RUN INTO DANGER BECAUSE THE MOTHER THEY PUT THE FIRST NAME A LAST NAME ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. WE HAVE A SYSTEM TO HELP THEM TO GET IT IT TAKES A COUPLE. WITH THE GET THE TO. GET THE. IN IN. SPACE IT TWO HAD BEEN YOU KNOW A PEOPLE TO REPAY BECAUSE WE YOU TODAY OUR LIVES STILL WANT A PROBLEM YOU HAVE BY IN ROW AND YOU GO TO BE FOR THAT SO WE DEMANDED WE WORK WITH YOU KNOW JUST BE YOU KNOW PLACE IN AND YOU YOU LUXURY WITH ME AND A HOUSE TO APPLY THAT SO A LOT OF DOUBLE WITH MISS WIDELY SHARE AND DO YOU NEED TO GET TO STORE APPROVED THE BAND ARE YOU KNOW. EVEN WOULD LIKE THERE WAS SOME EARLY BY ANY MORE TO WITH THE IF YOU WILL FAMILY REVIEW A OUR NEAR. YOU KNOW. BECAUSE PEOPLE DO KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR THEY DON'T KNOW CHANGE IT YOU MAY BECAUSE WHEN I GO. A FREE I WOULD GO THIRTY TWO YEARS. IN NAME WHEN I GOT OUT PEOPLE TO. ME TO SAME WAY. BUT I WOULD ASSUME SOME TOTALLY DIFFERENT. IS SO PEOPLE COULD LIKE YOU KNOW. ME AND GATHER INSIDE. IN THE CHANGE YOU HAVE BEFORE THEM AND THE PERSON KNOWS THAT. YOU KNOWS OF AT THE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY IMPORTANT I HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION FOR OUR ROOM. SECRETARY. I EIGHT. WHEN YOU GIVE SOMEBODY A. A SENS AND THEN THEY GO TO PRISON. AND THEN THEY HAVE BEHAVIORAL PROBLES IN THE PRISON. AND THIRD PRISON TERM IS THE US BECAUSE OF INFRACTIONS IN THE SYSTEM YOU HAVE. EXTENDED IN TIME. OF I VIEW THAT IS KIND OF A FAILURE OF PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND I VIEW IT AS SOMETHING THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD RECONSIDER THE WAY WE DO THAT. IN TERMS OF. THERE SHOULD BE NO PUNISHMENT CRIMINALLY FOR ANYBODY THAT HAS A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM. IN. TO THE WHEN WE EXTENDERS SENS OR THEIR TIME OR SOMEHOW. PROVIDE SOME PUNISHMENT FOR THEM IN THEIR BEHAVIOR. OF IS THERE'S SOME CHANGES THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING AND THEN I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT GANG AFFILIATION. OF AND LABELING PEOPLE RELATIVE TO GANGS AND EXTENSION OF THEIR SENTENCING. IS THAT A- WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE DONE TERMS OF EXTENDING THE SENSES AND IS IT. TIME TO REALLY CONSIDER SOME OF THOSE THINGS. I THINK IF. IT'S TIME THAT WE RECONSIDER MANY THINGS SENATOR- IN RELATION TO THE ADDITIONAL TIME THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO I'M ONLY THINKING OF INMATES WHO RECEIVED- GOOD CONDUCT CREDITS THAT APPLIED TO THEIR CURRENT SENTENCE THAT THERE'S ALREADY BUILT IN CREDIT CREDITS BUT READ IT IS DEMERITS IF THEY GET DEMERITS SO THEY LOSE THE CONDUCT CREDITS THAT THEY'VE EARNED BY EITHER THE TYPE A SENTENCE THEY RECEIVED OR- TIME OFF SENTENCES BY PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMMER OTHER OTHERWISE- THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION- AS STATED EARLIER TO HAS RISEN WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. WE DO HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR BEFORE WE DO BEFORE WE ADDRESS ANY LOSS OF CREDITS WE CAN DO BETTER AT FACT- WILL NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE COMMON CORD IS ASKING US TO BUT I THINK INTERNALLY WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE SOME OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT INMATES EXHIBIT OUR MENTAL HEALTH RELATED AND SHOULD THEY RECEIVE TIME OFF SENTENCE FOR THAT- IF WE CAN ATTRIBUTE TO THE MENTAL HEALTH. I THINK YOU KNOW BALANCING SAFETY SECURITY AND SUPPORTING STAFF NEEDS OUR CONCERNS AND HOW WE TRACK IN AND DEAL WITH AN INDIVIDUAL EITHER BY GETTING OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED. FOR PROVIDING. A SAFER LEVEL OF HOUSING FOR THEM BASED ON THE SECURITY IT'S A DIFFICULT. YOU KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT- POSITION TO BE IN TO TRY AND MATCH THE BOLD BUT I KNOW. ONE THING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS YOU KNOW DO WE WRITE DISCIPLINARY IS FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF THEIR SENTENCE JUST BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID HAS A MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT TO IT. I THINK GRANT A POINT ON CORRECTIONS WE CAN START MAKING BETTER INFORMED DECISIONS. BUT WE DO HAVE TO DOCUMENT THE BEHAVIOR FOR TREATMENT PURPOSES SO WE CAN SHOW EITHER FOR PRE PAROLE OR PROGRAM NEEDS. IT HAS TO BE DOCUMENTED SOMEWHERE- IN RELATION TO- FOR WE HOUSE INMATES THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE BEEN MATES DEBTORS- MENTALLY ILL. THE RAIN RESTRICTED HOUSINGS OUR ADS SAY EGGS ARE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WHATEVER YOU KNOW. WHATEVER TURN PEOPLE ON TO USE THESE DAYS BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT. A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH DOES DRIVE A PERSON'S PLACEMENT IN THOSE AREAS. AND THEN THEY LIKE TO STAY THERE FOR VARIOUS REASONS EITHER OUT OF FEAR. FOR THEIR TO THEY HAVE- DECOMPENSATED TO A POINT THAT'S ALL THE WORLD THAT THEY KNOW AND THAT'S A STRUGGLE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY. A PERSON'S BEHAVIOR SHOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY PLACE THEM IN A SEGREGATED HOUSING MAY THEY JUST SEEM TO BE IN ANOTHER TYPE OF HOUSING IN A- IN A- COMMUNITY SETTING OR AN AREA TO WERE STAFF FOR. OR CLINICAL STAFF CAN A JESTER NEEDS BETTER THAN AN AD SIX SETTING. SO WE TALKED ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THE TIME OFFICE SENTENCE BASIN BEHAVIOR. THAT'S MINUS THEM GETTING. ALSO ADDING OF TIME OR ADDING OF TIME WOULD BE THEY GO OUT AND GET ANOTHER CHARGE IN THE- WORK OF THE COMMITTEE ELEMENT COUNTY TODAY. WELL IN THAT CASE THE TICKET. THEY LOOKED ALL FACT AND THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN. WHEN THEY WERE TO CHARGE NOT. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS EXTEND THEIR SENT BASED TIME EARNED. THIS CASE WE HAVE TO- AND PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL ON THE ON THE COLEMAN CASE THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT THEY HAVE WITH US AND WE ARE. WE DON'T HAVE OUR HE'LL SO DUG IN BUT IT'S ABOUT MATCHING. GIVEN THE RIGHT ANSWER SO WE CAN MAINTAIN SAFETY SECURITY BUT THE SAME TIME. ADDRESSING THE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT AN INMATE HAS. SO WHAT ON THE RE ENTRY PIECE WHAT. WHAT WE HAVE NOW LONG. I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS NANA BUT JUST FOR A TO SAY IT RANCHERIA BEGINS DAY ONE. FOR AN INMATE. DAY ONE THAT THEY HAD A RECEPTION CENTER. AND THEN THE DAY ZERO BEFORE THEY GO OUT RE AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE. FIRST IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS TO MISTER WALLACE POINT- JUST. AN INMATE IN A VERY PROGRAM JUST AS AN OPENING DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S BEST PRO FOR THEM IS PROBABLY A WASTE OF RESOURCE. SO WE HAVE TO ASSESS WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS ARE WE HAVE TO ASSESS WHAT THE RISK IS. AND THAT HAS TO BE A STATIC ASSESSMENT IT I MEAN MORE DYNAMIC RIGHT NOW WITH STATIC. WE CAN DO IT. A NEAR ONE BUT THAT WE MAY NOT RECESS UNTIL YOUR FIVE A LOT OF HAPPENED IN THE FIVE YEARS THEY'VE MATURED THEY'VE LEARNED. AND GROWN SO THEIR NEEDS. ARE ALSO GOING TO INCREASE OF THE WE NEED TO BE MORE DYNAMIC ON WHAT WE HOUSE THEM- TO INCLUDE LOWER LEVEL HOUSING. INDIVIDUAL DON'T ALWAYS NEED TO BE A LEVEL FOUR FACILITIES WHICH ARE HIGHEST LEVEL THEY DON'T- AND I THINK THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDER PROGRAM THAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IS ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. RECOGNIZING THAT INMATES WHO HAVE BACKED UP MANY POINTS THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF INCARCERATION. THAT MAY NOT BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THEM IN YOUR FIVERR YOUR TEN. BECAUSE THEY HAVE LEARNED THAT WAS NOT A PROPER WAY THINKING. WE HAVE OVER WRITTEN DOWN INMATES IF THEY HAVE BEEN DESPAIR FREEZE WE CAN GET THEM THE NEEDS THAT THEY YOUR PAROLE- DEPARTMENTS FEEL THAT THERE IS A LACK OF. THE FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN YES. HOW CAN WE COORDINATE THAT. ISSUE WITH THE GOVERNORS. WELL I WORK THAT HE'S TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH ON THE HOUSING AND HOMELESS. POPULATION IT'S RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE HOUSING PIECE I THINK RE ENTRY SERVICES RAINTREE HOUSING NOT TO FOR THE SAKE OF HOUSING BUT WRAPAROUND SERVICES. IS CRITICAL AND THAT'S WERE. YOU KNOW PARTNERS OF OURS LIKE LIKE DOGS AND OTHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL BUT I KNOW. THAT THEIR FACED AND OTHERS ARE FACED WITH THE- THE CONCERN OF A FACILITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR ZONING OR PARTICULAR COUNTING OR AREA. IT'S VERY CHALLENGING WE HAVE HAD SITES THAT. PARTNERS THAT WE'VE HAD OUR TRIED TRY TO GET ZONE FOR FACILITIES AND JUST BECAUSE OF POLITICS ARE CONCERNED. WE CAN GET ZONED. THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED OUR PAROLE DIVISION- THEY ARE IN LINE WITH THE REHABILITATIVE CHANGES THAT WE'VE HAD IN OUR PRISONS. THEY HAVE THE SEVEN LINE THAT. ALSO TO PROVIDE THIS. WE'RE. THE TWO SHOULD HAVE GONE. HOW FORM. I OVERSEE THE PAROLE SIDE BUT I HAVE A GOOD. WITH THE PROBATION PARTNERS IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE ALL THE INFORMATION. THAT AND SERVICES THAT THE INMATE HAS RECEIVED THAT THEY GET THAT SAME INFORMATION FOR THE PROBATION. OFFICERS TO COUNTY SO THEY CAN BE. UTILIZING THE SAME INFORMATION TO PLUGIN. RELEASES INTO SERVICES THE SAME WAY PAROLE PLUGS AND RELEASES ANDERSON THANK TO. BE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RE ENTRY BEDS OR- OTHERWISE HOUSING. UNITS THAT INMATES COULD BE PLACED IN IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROPRIETY IS DIFFERENT TYPES. OF IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE I SEE THE NUMBERS THAT YOU SHOW YOUR THE OVER FIVE YEARS. SALAS THE SAME IT DOESN'T CHANGE. AND ARE WONDERING IF SOME KIND OF INITIATIVE COULD TAKE PLACE TO SHOW US. MAYBE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. THERE WOULD INCREASED THAT PROCESS BASED ON WHAT I HEARD HERE OF I HAD A QUESTION FOR DOUG TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION NO YOU MAY DEFINITELY DIRTY YOU LIKE THAT IDEA YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND HIS. YES COMMITTEE OR TASK FORCE THIS WORK ON THE SCRIPT MMHM SO I TAKE YOUR CHECK WE NEED TO GET THE- MORE SPECIFICS. COORDINATOR WITHOUT I'D LOVE TO SEE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THAT- YUP A FROM A JUST QUICKLY THAT- TO SOME DETAIL ON THAT WERE ACTUALLY PROPOSING AN EXPANSION OF A HUNDRED BEDS- FOR A NEW ONE HUNDRED BED REENTRY FACILITY IN ALAMEDA- AS PART OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET- WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO- TO FIND NEW REENTRY FACILITIES- AND A LOT OF LATE. HE'S TALKING ABOUT HE FOUND ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED SITES THAT WE- THAT I. LAST YEAR WAS A HUNDRED NOTES OVER HUNDRED SO HE'S GOT HE'S WORKING ON FINDING. HE SOME PROPERTIES THE NEW FACILITIES YEAH AND I DON'T THINK LEASE WHEN HE DID THAT WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE IN TERMS OF HOW WE- APPROACH THIS ISSUE WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH MISTER BOND ABOUT- HOW WE CAN- FACILITATE THE EXPANSION OF REENTRY FACILITIES AND GET AROUND SOME THE CONTRACTING ISSUES THAT HAVE. I THINK PRESENTS SOME CHALLENGES BUT- IT'S NOT SIMPLY AN ISSUE THAT WE CAN JUST KIND OF THROW MONEY AT THERE ARE COMPLEXITIES AROUND CITING AND SO FORTH SO- BUT I THINK WE'RE WE'RE CONSTANTLY EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THAT AREA THE GOVERNOR CONSIDERS THAT A COMMON CORNER STONE OF THE- OF OUR EFFORTS AROUND REENTRY. BUT A DOG I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION WE COULD MA'AM SURE DON'T YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE. IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OKAY AND I'M- I OFFERED A BILL TO AB. WHICH EXTEND THE AGE HOWEVER. YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHEN THE AGE OUT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR. AB TWELVE RIGHT OF CAN YOU TALK ABOUT FOSTER USE A DEBIT **** ADULTS THAT AGE OUT AND HOW THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A. B. TWELVE SERVICES THAT'S THE EXTENT AGE FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE AND- I MIGHT ADD I HAVE A BILL THAT EXTENDS IT TO TWENTY FIVE OF INTRODUCED SO I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IN THAT I KNOW I HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND I WOULD WONDER ON OUR OWN IT EIGHTEEN WELL CAN YOU AND I GUESS ON. YOU KNOW AS A FIVE CHILD NOT HAVING THE RESOURCES WORK ON BUILDING TRANSITION AGES HOUSING AND WE WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICE AND I CAN TELL YOU BEING IN THAT SAYS YOU DO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA UNIT. YOU GO. FOR HOUSE TO HOUSE THE NOT ONE FAMILY GIVEN TO. OVER DOESN'T YOU KNOW SO YOU'RE IN MULTIPLE FAMILIES- IT'S VERY CHALLENGING AND TO SAY THAT SOMEBODY IS READY AT EIGHTEEN. THREE INDEPENDENT AND TO LIVE ON THEIR OWN IS JUST NOT CORRECT AND WE KNOW THIS- IN JUVENILE HALL. THEY TURNED- UNDER THE JURORS RIGHT. THEY TURN EIGHTEEN. AND THEY HAVE A MOTOROLA BY THIS IS THE CASE THAT A BROTHER. WHO WAS INJURED WHEN ALL HE HE WAS A FOSTER KID. AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE THE SERVICES HE WENT TO COLLEGE. THE OTHER BROTHER THE ITS CURRENCY CHENEY BECAME LIKE ON THE STREETS AND WHAT'S SO TRAGIC ABOUT THAT IS IN MANY INSTANCES THE SAME POPULATION IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHO SHOWED UP FOR. THE SHERIFF OR SOCIAL WORKER THAT'S CORRECT IN YOUR LIFE BUT IT'S THEY'RE THE SAME. YEAH I IT'S DO WITH THAT IS THAT A MAJOR. IT IS A PER. IN IT NEEDS BE A- I THINK PEOPLE ARE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE IS THAT WE NEED MORE RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING HOME ESPECIALLY FROM INCARCERATION IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR INDIVIDUALS TRANSITION AND OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WITHOUT THE OTHER ADDITIONAL ISSUES OF COMING OUT OF A CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM- SO TO TAKE THAT RESOURCE AWAY FROM THEM IS ONLY GOING TO PUT THAT IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY WILL LIKELY END UP IN THE ADULT SYSTEM MORE HAVE A HIGHER RISK. TO END UP IN THE ADULT SYSTEM AND THEN COME TO US TWENTY YEARS SAID LATER FOR HELP. SO I THINK THAT DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED I THINK IS A SOMEBODY THAT'S EXPERIENCE THAT I CAN SAY THAT. AND SOMEBODY IT'S NOW APPARENT YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER I ADOPTED MY DAUGHTER AT FIVE YEARS OLD SHE'S FIFTEEN. AND I'M VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO GET THOSE RESOURCES BUT I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE THE I LIVED ON MY OWN I WAS FIFTEEN. IN A YEARS OLD. I KNOW THE CHECK. WHICH IS A BUT IT WAS A- FIFTEEN YEAR. LIVING ON MY OWN THAN STRUCK. WORKING TWO JOBS AND TRYING TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND TRYING TO GET BY AND NOT REALLY ACCESS IN THOSE KIND OF RESOURCES AS WELL. AND REALLY AVAILABLE IN THE STATE THAT I LIVED IN- OR- MADE AWARE OF TO MEANS AT THAT TIME SO. YES I. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT THINK INDIVIDUALS AND DJJ IN AND OTHER JUVENILE INSTITUTIONS I WOULD IMAGINE. THE CORRECTIONS AND PROBATION THOSE ARE- BARRIERS FOR THEM AS WELL TO BECAUSE THEY'RE HELPING TO COORDINATE GETTING THEM OUTOF THE SYSTEMS OF RESOURCES. AND SO ME I COULDN'T. SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THAT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS SO. FINDS OUT IF ANY OF THE PEOPLE UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION ARE ELIGIBLE. ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER ONES. FOR FOSTER CARE SERVICES. BECAUSE I DON'T THEN I VISIT THE PRISONS AND I ASKED THE QUESTION OF THE WARDENS HOW MANY OF THE IMAGES THINKER. FORMER FOSTER YOU. I HEAR ALL KINDS OF NUMBERS LIKE 60% 50% OF IS A HUGE NUMBER AT LEAST I MEAN I HAVE NO IDEA I THINK WE HAVE THE SOLID. YEAH AND IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH THE FEDERAL CHILD WELFARE ACT. PUTS MONEY INTO THESE PROGRAMS. THE IF WE- LET ME CHANGE THIS LAW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. FOR ALL THE SERVICES THAT OTHER FOSTER YOU FORGET. AND IT SEEMS LIKE A REAL NO BRAINER FOR US TO DO THAT AND TO HELP THEM- ACHIEVE SUCCESS IN THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE CHILDWELFARE AXLE ABOUT IS TO TRY TO FIND A WAY OF CHI ACHIEVING- SUCCESS SO I DON'T SURE I HAD AHEAD I ONLY HAVE ONE MORE THING I WANT TO DO. COULD YOU FIND OUT HOW MUCH THE AVERAGE PRISONER COSTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO DISH IN THIS BUDGET. WHAT IS THE NUMBER FOR THAT AT THAT SOMEBODY KNOWS. I HAD L. L. HAVE YOU DOWN TO THE NEAREST DOLLAR BUT I TELL YOU THAT IT'S ABOUT. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE AVERAGE BECAUSE- WHAT'S THE COST AND AN EMPHASIS ON AVERAGE BECAUSE AS WE WERE TOLD EARLIER YOU KNOW EVERY BAD ISN'T DESIGNED YEAH THAT THERE THERE ARE NO AVERAGE INMATES EVERY INMATE IS UNIQUE SO. AVERAGE I APPRECIATE THAT OF THE OVERALL AVERAGE IS ABOUT NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PROJECTED FOR THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- HOW MUCH OF A FOR WOMEN INMATES. SO THAT'S AN OVERALL AVERAGE INCLUDES WOMEN- WE I DON'T HAVE ANY DATA IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE ON THE BREAK OUT BETWEEN THE MEN AND WOMEN'S THAT'S JUST THAT'S A CUMULATIVE AVERAGE ON THE OTHER THE OTHER MAN SURE THE OTHER THING THE WOMAN. SAID OUR LITTLE SAFE MEETING WE HAD A LITTLE SAFE MEETING THERE WITH THE THERE'S OVER A THOUSAND ON THAT ONE TATTOO REMOVAL. AS A BELIEVE THAT THE GANG MARK ON THEIR- BODY WILL. ENCOURAGE LAST CHANCE FOR PAROLE WELL AND THEN THE CHALLENGE FOR THE WOMEN BECAUSE IF IT'S IF THE TATTOO WAS GANG RELATED IT CAN BE REMOVED THE CHALLENGE FOR MOST WOMEN IS THE TATTOOS ARE THE NAMES OF MEN IN THEIR LIVES AND THERE'S NOT ALWAYS AN ASSOCIATION OF THE THAT HIS NAME ON YOUR FOREHEAD AS I HAVE. BORNE WITNESS TO IS A DIRECT GANG AFFILIATION AND SO THE WOMEN IT'S THE NATURE OF THE TATTOOS- THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE EXPAND THE LAW TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE INCLUDED THERE IS FUNDING WE HAVE A TATTOO REMOVAL PROGRAM YES YOU TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE IT BIGGER AYE GARCIA WE DO HAVE FUNDING SO AS WELL OF THE RE ENTRY NUMBER THE NONPROFIT TO DO IT AS WELL- SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR BAIL- YES WE'VE GOT- OUR LAST MEMBER WHO ASK QUESTIONS AND THEN WE WILL OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AS I QUEUE UP SOME TO COP A YEAR OKAY IF I CAN JUST SEE BY SHE'S A SIGN A SHOW OF HANDS HOW MANY PEOPLE TEND PARTICIPATING PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU VERY. SEND A COPY OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS I ACT ACTUALLY. KIND OF FALL INTO TWO. TWO AREAS- AT FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT- THAT THIS IS A BUDGET. A HEARING SO THAT IT IT I APPRECIATE THAT THE BUDGET ASPECTS OF THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT IT HAS ON OUR BUDGET BUT- BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE HUMANISTIC APPROACH- AT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND- SECRETARY. SECRETARY DS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MISSION IN THE VISION. STATEMENTS AND I LOOKED HIM UP WHILE YOU WERE TALKING SO THAT I COULD GET A SENSE OF WHERE YOU WERE COMING FROM AND- AND I THINK THEY'RE ON I JUST WANT A- BET PERSONALLY I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE TERRIFIC THERE ARE OWED MAP. FOR WHERE I THINK THE DEPARTMENT SEES ITSELF GOING AND- AND NAKED THAT GIVES ME A LOT OF. A LOT OF HOPE AND THEN I ALSO WANTED THINK- MISTER WIDELY MISTER BOND AND MISTER JOHNSON FOR BEING HERE TODAY BECAUSE YOU PUT THE FACE AND THE PROGRAM- FRONT AND CENTER AND ULTIMATELY. PART OF OUR BUT DID DISCUSSION IS HOW CAN WE DO A BETTER JOB. OF REHABILITATING. EIGHT TO HOW AND WHY ARE THE STEPS WE TO DO A ORDER TO BE ABLE TO THAT HAVE. MISTER WHAT I BELIEVE YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- ON THAT SO I JUST WANT TO BE. CLEAR I'M ASSUMING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU NEED- STATE SUPPORT FOR THAT BECAUSE- I RUN A NONPROFIT DOING VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND- YOU GO AROUND WITH THEIRHAT IN HAND IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES SO. IF YOU COULD TALK TO A LITTLE BIT YEAH DEFINITELY- STATE SUPPORT IS GREATLY BADLY NEEDED OF LOCAL- SUPPORT- COUNTY CITY BASE. IMPORT OF FOR SURE- AND PART OF THAT IS ABOUT. I WAS THE FINANCIALS OF ISN'T BUT ALSO JUST IN ACCESS TO THE INSTITUTIONS INTO THE PEOPLE WE WORKING WITH- A AND I THINK I WILL SAY YOU KNOW THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THINGS GOT A LOT BETTER- AND THOSE ARE GOOD IDEAS IS. COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES THE VALUE THAT FOLKS BRING WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME TO THE INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING IN AS A PART OF A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION ARE COMING AS VOLUNTEERS. THEY'RE DOING IT ON EVENINGS WEEKENDS- AND NONE OF US CAN SUPPORT OURSELVES OUR FAMILIES AS WELL AS VOLUNTEERS SO WE NEED A MUCH MUCH BROADER BASE OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT THOSE% EFFORTS. AND I GUESS AS A FOOTNOTE TO THAT- ALL SERVICES ARE NOT EQUAL SO THERE MAY BE REALLY GOOD SERVICES AND IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT RURAL AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT. AND IT'S BIG AND MANY OF THE INMATES AT A RETURNING TO THEIR- COUNTIES ARE LIVING AN ISOLATED COMMUNITY SO THAT THIS SUPPORT AND THE- THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM MAY BE LIMITED AND SO THEM. I JUST THINK WE NEED TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT JUST LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE THAT HAS A REAL GOOD SUPPORT SERVICE PROGRAM BUT THAT THAT THE ON. SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTIES HAVE HAVE THAT AS WELL I'M AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO SOLVE THAT ISSUE BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK THE YOUR COMMENTS TODAY. ARE OUR- AS WHAT I HAVE SEEN. WHICH IS THAT IT IT YOU KNOW TO HAND- IN INDIVIDUAL TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A ONE WAY TICKET. JUST DOESN'T GET THEM STARTED ON AND ON THE LIFE THAT ON THAT'S GOING TO BE. REALLY SUPPORTED AND THE KIDS IN THE BEST CHANCE FOR SUCCESS SO WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SERVICES ARE THAT. THAT YOU NEED TO WRAP AROUND HOW DO WE SUPPORT THAT FINANCIALLY. UP BECAUSE IN THE END BUT WE WANT TO DO IS REDUCE OUR OWN COSTS AS WELL AS WELL AS INTEGRATE. INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY- SO THE OTHER THING SO THAT SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND- I'M SURE THAT- THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WILL HAVE SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN. WE CAN EXPAND THOSE SERVICES. IN REGARDS TO THE TESTIMONY ABOUT. REDUCING THE CONTRACTS. ED THE CONTRACTED BEDS AND THE THIS AND PARTICULAR WHAT I'M WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT WERE IN A FIVE I HAVE IT ON A PIECE A NAPKIN SO HIT IT'S NOT AS THOROUGH AS I'D LIKE IT TO BE. IN MARCH WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT WERE PAYING FOR IN IN THE PRIVATE TO THE PRIVATE CONTRACTOR IN APRIL THAT THAT'S ANOTHER RATCHET DOWN AND MY QUESTION- BECAUSE I WAS AROUND. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE WERE CONTRACTING OUT OF STATE AND THOSE CONTRACTS WERE FAIRLY ONEROUS BECAUSE IT REQUIRED US TO SEND A MINIMUM NUMBER OF INMATES OUT OF STATE INTO A- CONTRACTED FACILITY AND WE NEVER MET OUR TARGETS. SO AS A CONSEQUENCE WE WERE PAYING FOR BEDS THAT WE NEVER FIELD. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE AS WE LOOK AT THIS. OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF THOSE BEDS THAT WE'RE STILL NOT PAYING FROM EVEN IF FOR TOUCH UTILIZING THEM- CERTAINLY- CENTER THE WAY THE CONTRACTS ARE STRUCTURED WE ONLY PAY FOR THE BAD THAT WE USE. SO WE WOULD NOT BE AND THAT SORT OF SITUATION IN THIS CASE OKAY SO WHAT AS WE ELIMINATE THOSE BEDS WERE MOVING THEM BACK INTO OUR OWN FACILITIES AND NOTES AND THAT KIND THOSE CONTRACTS TERMINATE AND WE DON'T WE'RE NOT PAYING ON A MANY ANY LONGER ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND THERE'S NO PENALTY ON ON THOSE HOUSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. I AM A- PRESIDING. TIME TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS ON THE DICE. RIGHT THEN WE WILL TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THE MIKE RIGHT THERE THE MIKE IN THE AISLE. GOOD AFTERNOON DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU TO THE I'M AMANDA LIFE FOR IT I AM AN AREA MANAGER WITH CHIU EVERY COUNTRY SERVICES HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING READ MANY PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'VE BEEN WITH JURY ON TREE FOR OF LOVE IN YEARS NOW AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING- HERE IN THIS FABULOUS TO. I'M UTILIZING THIS OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TO HIGHLIGHT OUR OBJECTIVE TODAY. TO BE SOLUTION FOCUSED WITH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO RE ENTRY SERVICES HAS COLLABORATED WHERE OF CDC ARE AND MANY COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND WE'RE PROUD TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE CAN AGREE THAT THOSE MANY AGENCIES THAT WANT TO HELP JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS WHETHER IT BE FOR PROFIT NON FOR PROFITVOLUNTEERS. AND WE KNOW THAT THE JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATION CAN USE ALL OF THE HELP THAT THEY CAN GET- WE'RE ALL HERE FOR THE SAME REASON TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. ROOF COMMUNITY PUBLIC SAFETY AND ULTIMATELY TURNS LIVE. WHAT I'D LIKE TO BRING FOCUS TO TODAY THAT HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BACK. BUT IS REALLY GOING BACK TO THE RESEARCH SO WITH SOME INDIVIDUALS TODAY HAVE ASKED WELL HOW DO WE BE A FACTOR BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR OUR TAX PELA. MANY MANY YEARS AGO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CORRECTIONS AND THE CRIME AND JUSTICE INSTITUTE. TOOK ALL OF THE RESEARCH AROUND WHAT WORKS IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM WHAT CAN WE DO TO ACTUALLY IMPACT ADULT CRIMINAL THINKER. AND THEY TOOK THAT RESEARCH META ANALYSIS AND TURNED IT INTO A FRAMEWORK THAT PROVIDERS LECTURE REENTRY AND OTHERS CAN PUT INTO PRACTICE. THIS FRAMEWORK IS KNOWN AS THE EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION AND I REALLY WANT TO BRING THAT BACK TO THE TABLE BECAUSE UTILIZING THOSE INTERVENTION FOR THE POPULATION WERE DISCUSSING. THE RESPONSIBLE AND ETHICAL THING TO DO I'VE BEEN VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SAYS. THAT AT G. A REENTRY WE ARE OPERATIONALIZE AND THERE'S PRINCIPLES EVERY pEARLIER A HOW OF PRO. AND EXPERTS IN OUR FIELD THE- THREE WAYS TO MEASURE PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS THE FIRST ONE BILLION RECIDIVISM REDUCTION WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED TODAY OF COURSE IT HAS ITS PROS AND IT'S CONS WE OFTEN HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MEASURING APPLES TO APPLES HERE. BUT AGAIN IF THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE GOLD STANDARD SO REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM NUMBER TWO WHICH HASN'T REALLY BEEN MENTIONED TODAY IS INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES SO THINGS SUCH AS REDUCTIONS IN CRIMINAL THINKING REDUCTIONS INVALIDATED RESTS CORE IT DIDN'T AND EMPLOYMENT GAIN SOME SOBRIETY ACTUAL OUTCOME MATCHA IS SO NOT DATA POINTS LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE COMPLETED A PROGRAM BUT TRUE BEHAVIOR TENANTS. AND THEN THE THIRD ONE ONE OF MY FAVORITE IS ACTUALLY APPARENT THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES SO GOING BACK TO THE FRAMEWORK THERE'S EIGHT PRINCIPLES ARE WE MEASURING UP PROGRAMS AT HERONS TO THE RESET ARE WE ACTUALLY YOU UTILIZING VALIDATED ASSESSMENTS THAT MEASURE WHETHER OR NOT A PROGRAM IS. GOING TO THE FIDELITY OF WHAT WORKS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM AT GEO REENTRY WE HAVE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE HAVE OUTCOME MEASURES THAT SHOW THAT WERE IMPACTING BEHAVIOR TENANTS THAT WERE IMPACTING THE LIVES THAT WE SIT HERE AND TALK TO ALL. OF YOU ABOUT TO DEBT WE WOULD LOVE TO INVITE ALL OF YOU AT ANY TIME AND YOU THE PROBE THAT WE- ACROSS STATE. ARE WE MENTIONED WOMEN'S CUSTODY ISSUES TODAY WE HAVE A FANTASTIC PROGRAM AND MCFARLAND WE ALSO HAVE PROGRAMS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND MANY COUNTY ARE THE REPORTING SENATE'S AS WELL. SO WE CAN PROVIDE THE OUTCOME MEASURES TO BACK UP THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE COMPASSES SO AND WITH EVERYONE AND REALLY BE INVOLVED IN THIS COMMITTEE. TO TALK ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN BRING TO THE TABLE AND THE FUTURE OF HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COULD MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE SPACE TO ALLOWING US TO OFFER SOME FEEDBACK IN OUR THOUGHTS MY NAME IS FATIMA COM I'M WITH THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE AND ALSO REPRESENTING CALIFORNIANS UNITED FOR RESPONSIBLE BUDGET CORRECT- I WANTED TO TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS OVER THE COURSE OF THE HEARING. ANOTHER THINGS WAS THERE'S FEAR OF LETTING PEOPLE OUT EARLY. PROVIDING OVERCROWDING WHAT WOULD THE BEST QUICKEST WAYS TO MITIGATE THAT IS TO RELEASE PEOPLE FROM INCARCERATION- THERE HAS NOT BEEN THERE'S A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT. PEOPLE COMING HOME TO SEND COMMUNITIES- IT DOES NOT CORRELATE TO HIGHER CRIME RATES OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S THIS FEAR THAT IT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERN THE WAS VALID. IS NOT SHOWING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE INCREASED SPIKE OF CRIMES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WE HAVE BEEN SENTENCING PEOPLE TO REALLY LONG SENTENCES UNNECESSARILY AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE. CONTINUALLY WORKED ON AND ADDRESSED- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONE THING THAT REALLY DOES HELP PEOPLE COMING HOME RETURNING HOME IS INVESTING IN COMMUNITY CARE PROGRAM SO COMMUNITY DRIVEN COMMUNITY LED. AN COMMITTEE PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE RETURNING HOME- ANOTHER WAY TO MITIGATE THIS ISSUE OF RECIDIVISM IS TO ALLOW FOR START OF JUSTICE PROGRAMMING BOTH ON THE FRONT AND IS AS A DIVERSION. AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE COMING HOME AND SHOULD NOT BE DONE JUST FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ALSO FOR ADULTS. I'M CURRENTLY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY IN SOME SCHOOL COUNTY WE HAVE. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR MINORS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE. POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE CHARGED WITH SOMETHING. OF WHEN THEY PARTICIPANTS DIVERSION PROGRAM THEY ARE THEN TRACKED. OF THREE YEARS AFTER. AFTER COMPLETING THIS RESTORED OF PROGRAM. WHEN THEY'RE TRIED WE CAN SEE THAT IN SOME CISCO COUNTY THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE CIRCLES ARE LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. SO LET'S BEEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM HAVE HAD ANY CONTACT WITH PLEASE WITHIN THREE YEARS OF FINISHING THE PROGRAM AT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT NUMBER IS LESS THAN 20% SO WE CAN SEE THAT THE OUR NUMBERS WE HAVE EVIDENCE. IS THAT I CAN. THAT CAN CURB AND CAN PEOPLE OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND ON TOP OF THAT RESTORED OF JUSTICE DOES SOMETHING THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM LACKS. IT DOES NOT A RESERVE JUST AS HOLD THE SPACE FOR VICTIM OFFENDER DIALOGUES AND ALSO FOR HEALING THE FOR ABLE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE. DURING THE TIME OF AN OFFENSE AND GET THEM AND THE AND THE VICTIM TOGETHER TO.TO TALK THINGS OUT TO COME TO. SOLUTIONS AND TO ALSO LOOK AT OKAY WELL WHAT BECAUSE THE SITUATION TO HAPPEN AND WHY WE CAN BE SAVING A LOT OF MONEY AND HOPEFULLY BE DRIVING DOWN THE POPULATION OF INCARCERATION WERE DIVERTED PEOPLE AWAY. AND LASTLY I THINK AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNICATOR E. THAT TURNING OVER RE ENTRY PROGRAMS AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING TO PRIVATE COMPANIES SUCH AS GEO GROUP IN OUR EXPERIENCE HAS NEVER BEEN A GOOD THING IT'S ALWAYS BEEN- IF SOMEONE IS COMING HOME FROM CONSERVATION THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS TO BE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MIMICS PUNITIVE. MEASURES PRACTICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE SEEING CONTINUOUSLY AND BEST PRACTICES WE THING IS TO PULL AWAY FROM THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ELIZABETH FRASER I'M ALSO WITH THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE AND A MEMBER ORGANIZATION OF CURB CALIFORNIANS UNITED FOR RESPONSIBLE BUDGET- IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO BE IN A ROOM FOR A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT CLOSING PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO START MY REMARKS BY URGING FOLKS TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT NOT JUST CLOSING ONE PRISON BUT THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CLOSE THREE FOUR FIVE PRISONS IN THE COMING YEARS. AND SENATOR SKINNER YOU ASKED FOR REDUCTION STRATEGIES THAT COULD LEAD TO THESE KINDS OF CLOSURES AND I THINK THE THING THAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON TODAY IS AROUND SENTENCING- WE HEARD EARLIER FROM MISTER GRAVES THAT THE RESEARCH DOES NOT SUPPORT THAT LONGER SENTENCES MEANS BETTER PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE'VE HEARD- EXAMPLES TODAY OF WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THAT REPEALING THREE STRIKES HI MISTER WILEY MENTIONS THAT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE SEARCHLIGHT SENTENCES WE ALSO HAVE OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE SENTENCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ISRAEL STRONGLY URGING. BUT JUST DIRTY CONSIDERATE. LA WITHOUT PAROLE SENTENCES TO REPEAL TREES. STE WE HAD A KIND. TO T. HERE OR ELDER PAROLE AND- I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ABOUT 24% OF THE CURRENT POPULATION. THAT'S INCARCERATED IN CDC OURS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY CURRENTLY THAT'S WAY HIGHER AS A PROPORTION THAN IT'S EVER BEEN IN AS WE DISCUSSED TODAY THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE LEGACY OF EXTREME SENTENCING. CURB IS RECOMMENDING IT THAT THAT THE THRESHOLD FOR OLDER PAROLE ELIGIBILITY BE REDUCED TO FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE SERVED FIFTEEN YEARS OF THEIR SENTENCES. WE'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE A MEMO WITH YOU EXPLAINING THE RESEARCH BEHIND THAT IN THE REASONINGS FOR OUR OUR RECOMMENDATION OF THAT. THE OTHER PIECE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THAT IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LEGISLATION AND HISTORIC LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN PASSED. WITH REDUCED- AND ELIMINATED SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS BUT NONE OF THESE BILLS HAVE BEEN RETROACTIVE- NOW THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT ONE OF WHICH IS THAT IT WOULD COST A LOT OF MONEY TO MAKE IT THOSE BILLS RETROACTIVE INTO APPLY THOSE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS REPEALS TO PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY SERVING TIME FOR THEM. WHAT I WAS HEARING TODAY IS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING THIRTEEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS ON CORRECTIONS IN IN OUR STATE AND WE'VE GOT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS HONOR ON OURS STATE PRISONS I WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT AND I THINK IN THE LONG RUN IN THE LONG TERM AT THE HIGH. LEVEL ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES. A LONG TERM. ABLE REDUCTIONS IN PRISON POPULATIONS I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT APPLYING THESE BILLS RETROACTIVELY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY SERVING TIME. I TO ME COMMUNITY CARE ENHANCES PUBLIC SAFETY AND I THINK TO SOME OF THESE STEPS WE CAN INVEST STRONGLY AND COMMUNITY CARE AS A WAY TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY- THE LAST THING THAT I JUST LIKE TO SAY IS THAT I HAD. CURB HAS SEVENTY MEMBER ORGANISATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ONLY ONE OF US WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT HERE TODAY. AND SO I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUBMISSIONS OF FEEDBACK ONLINE OR THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS FOR GROUPS THAT AREN'T ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY. THAT HAVE STRONG RESEARCH BASED- SUGGESTIONS OF WAYS THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS A POSSIBILITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. ANY REMAINING PUBLIC COMMENT. ALRIGHT WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED AND- FOR YOUR INSIGHT YOUR SUGGESTIONS YOUR OBSERVATIONS- AND CLEARLY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- MY SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BE GETTING INTO A LOT OF THESE IN MORE DETAIL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING MANY OF YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR ALSO PARTICIPATING AND STAFF FOR THE PREPARATION. FRANCIS OVER EVERYONE ELSE IN WITH THAT ANALYSTS SPECIFIC GENRE SURGERY RIGHT IN WITH THAT WE WILL NOW BE. A JURY. RIGHT.
