BECAUSE COLLEGE HUNGER IS STILL SO HIGH THERE'S MORE FOR US TO DO SO SB SIX FORTY ONE CODIFIES MANY POSITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS. OF THE WORK GROUPS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN CODIFIED. HOW FRESH IS OUR BEST TOOL TO COMBAT COLLEGE HUNGER. 46% OF THE STUDENTS THAT APPLY FOR CALFRESH ASSISTANCE ARE FOOD INSECURE HOMELESS FOR BOOKS. AND DATA INDICATES THAT MANY OF THE STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION OR STUDENTS OF COLOR FEMALE.

A WORKING GROUP SITS ON IT FEELS GOOD TO SEE SOMETHING. ACTUALLY RESULT FROM IT AND SO THAT WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE WORKING GROUP AND THEY CAME UP WITH MANY GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THE BILL DOES. IS THAT ONCE THE- CALFRESH WAS MORE AVAILABLE ELIGIBILITY WAS MORE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WHAT OUR COUNTY WELFARE. DEPARTMENTS EXPERIENCED WAS A RUSH OF APPLICATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH. SCHOOL SESSION. AND IT WAS VERY HARD FOR THEM TO PROCESS. AND SO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS- ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE BILL IS THAT IT REQUIRES. THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WORK GROUP TO DESIGN A CALFRESH APPLICATION PROCESS THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE. THE LARGE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED AT THE START OF EACH YEAR. IN ORDER TO HELP ARE. ON COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENTS HANDLE THIS AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.
