PROGRESS CONTINUES REGARDLESS OF THE MINISTRATION. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA DOES NOT SPECIFY A PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE MUST PROVIDE VOTER REGISTRATION FORMS TO EDUCATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONS. SB FOUR THIRTY ONE GUARANTEES IT THERE IS A PRO ACTIVE PROCESS FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS REQUIRE VOTER REGISTRATION FORMS BY REQUIRING THAT THESE FORMS BE SENT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF A REQUEST BY SCHOOL -- IN AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND WHEN YOU HAVE A COMMITTEE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I DON'T MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER OF WHAT IS IN SUPPORT. TO ME MARK ON THE HALF OF SECRETARY STATE ALEX PADILLA -- FOR THE REASONS STATED WE SUPPORT THE MEASURE. OTHER WITNESSES OTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OPPOSITION ANY OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. NO QUESTIONS CENTER LEYVA MOVES THE BILL -- MOUNTAINS WHICH LIKE CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK HER I DON'T THINK SO MUCH RESEARCH HERE. THANK YOU SEVEN REQUIRE OF THEM SIR TO IF YOU CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS NUMBER. NUMBER GUY NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG. LEYVA LEYVA AYE STERN. ALL RIGHT SIR WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN. RIGHT THANK YOU. OUR NEXT -- SENATOR BATES. SB FOUR OH ONE CENTER BATES PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SB FOUR OH ONE WOULD CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS CANDIDATES AND ELECTED OFFICIALS TO PROMOTE THEMSELVES THROUGH THE USE OF CANDIDATE. CONTROL BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO OTHERWISE APPLICABLES CONTRIBUTION LIMITS EXISTING LAW IMPOSES CANDIDATE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. OF FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED FOR SENATE AND ASSEMBLY SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED FOR ALL STATEWIDE OFFICES OTHER THAN GOVERNOR AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND FOR THE GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGNS. THE PARAMETERS ARE INTENDED TO LIMIT THE DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE OF WEALTHY DONORS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS ENSURING CALIFORNIAN. MOTORS CAN PARTICIPATE. THE THIS SEEMS TO BE A MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT -- OKAY ALL RIGHT. WHAT? HI I'M I APOLOGIZE WE OWE THEM. TURN DOWN THE MUSIC HOLD SO I'M NOT EVEN HEARING IT YOU GUYS. I'M SORRY SENATE PLEASE GO AHEAD -- LET'S SEE I WAS THAT CANDIDATE CONTROL BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEESON THE OTHER HAND ARE NOT SUBJECT. AND TO ANY CONTRIBUTION LIMITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE COMMITTEES ARE OFTEN TWENTY FIVE FIFTY OR EVEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SOME IS GONE AS HIGH AS A MILLION DOLLARS. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ALLOWING UNLIMITED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES IS THAT THEY ARE FORMED WITH THE LEGAL INTENT TO SUPPORT OR OPPOSE BALLOT MEASURES. UNFORTUNATELY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CANDIDATE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH ARE CAPPED AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES CONTROLLED BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES WHICH ARE NOT CAPPED HAS BEEN HAS BECOME ARE SOMEWHAT DISTORTED. SOME CANDIDATES AND ELECTED OFFICIALS NEW USE THEIR SIZEABLE BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES ACCOUNTS FOR PURPOSES VIRTUALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGNING. THE PRACTICE OF USING KENNEDY CONTROL BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE FUNDS FOR KENNEDY CAMPAIGN PURPOSES DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE WILL OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS WHO OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED TO ENACT. THE CONTRIBUTION LIMITS WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP. THIRTY FOUR IT IS CLEAR THAT CREATIVE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS. AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE USING COMMITTEES ARE SOMETIMES TO CIRCUMVENT THE CONTRIBUTION LIMITS ENACTED BY PROP. THIRTY FOUR ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE F. PPC FOLLOWING THE PROPOSITIONS ENACTMENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO KENNEDY CONTROLLED BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES ROSE BY AN ASTOUNDING. INVESTIGATION THE LEAD TO FORMER SENATOR LELAND HE'S FEDERAL INDICTMENT. HE TOLD AN UNDERCOVER F. BY F. B. I. AGENT HE COULD AVOID THE RESTRICTIONS OF CONTRIBUTION LIMITS BY GIVING MONEY TO A BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE. THAT WOULD RAN ADS FEATURING HIM IN A POSITIVE LIGHT THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS JUST HOW EASILY THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMITS CAN BE SKIRTED CURRENTLY. IT IS TIME TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES SO THAT KENNEDY IS AN ELECTED OFFICIALS CANNOT USE MANY INTENDED FOR PROMOTING OR OPPOSING BALLOT MEASURES. TO INSTEAD PROMOTE THEMSELVES AND THEIR CAMPAIGNS. NOW WITH ME TODAY. FROM THE CLEAN MANY CAMPAIGN IS TRANSLATING WHO WILL ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND MAKE SOME COMMENTS. THANK YOU SIR BATES. SELECT THE THANK YOU -- A GOOD MORNING CHAIR SENATORS -- I'D LIKE TO THINK AND CENTER BATES FOR BRING FORTH THIS IMPORTANT BILL -- IT DOES GIVE I THINK THE PUBLIC. CONCERN ABOUT -- IS AT LEAST THE APPEARANCES OF OF UNDUE INFLUENCE FROM SPECIAL INTERESTS WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO GIVE THESE UNLIMITED CONTRIBUTIONS -- TO CAM A CONTROLLED BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES -- I THINK THE THE A FORK FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS AS AS SHE DESCRIBED -- THE THE F. P. B. C. ITSELF BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE BAY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY TRIED TO PUT REGULATIONS IN PLACE TO TO TO DO SO -- AS YOU SEEN THE ANNOUNCES THE THE COURT AT THE TIME FOUND THAT THE FPC DID NOT HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. TO DO SO -- BUT THEY DID NOT RULE THE COURT DID NOT RULE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF OF THERE BEING A WOMEN SO THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE HERE THIS ISN'T THIS BILLS NOT TRYING TO SAY YOU CAN'T HAVE HAVE. CONTRIBUTION LIMITS TO ANY ABOUT MEASURE COMMITTEE JUST A CANDIDATE CONTROLLED BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES -- AS A P. B. C. IN -- TWO THOUSAND FIVE RECOMMENDED DOING SO SO WE WOULD STRONGLY AGREEWITH THIS BILL AND AND HOPED URGE THAT YOU -- FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SURE MEMBERS AT THE SETTLERS CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE ALSO IN SUPPORT. THE REASON UNDER US SUPREME COURT JURISPRUDENCE WELL YOU CAN'T HAVE CONTRIBUTION LIMITS ON THAT MEASURE CAMPAIGNS IS THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE OSTENSIBLY CORRUPTING INFLUENCE ON CANDIDATES. WE THINK -- WHEN YOU HAVE CAN BE CONTROLLED BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES OF THAT IS A DIFFERENT PIECE THAT IS A DISTINCTION THAT'S WORTH NOTING? SO FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CURRENT LAW THE PERSON COULD GIVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CANDY CONTROL BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE AND I CAN THEY COULD THEN TURN AROUND AND FUTURE ADDS. OSTENSIBLY FOR THE BALLOT MEASURE BUT ALSO PAIN THEMSELVES IN A POSITIVE LIGHT THIS SEEMS TO BE A A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT A POSSIBILITY CIRCUMVENTING OR EXISTING CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES -- WE THINK WITH THIS BILL SIMPLY DANCES STATUS IS A CLEAR BRIGHT LINE RULE FOR THE SAME CONTRIBUTION LIMITS THAT APPLY TO CAN IT'S ALSO APPLY TO CAN TO CONTROL BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES. I THINK IT'S A VERY ELEGANT AND SIMPLE WAY OF ENSURING THAT MONEY DOESN'T. USUALLY CIRCUMVENT OUR EXISTING RULES FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT THANK YOU. OTHERS OTHERS IS FOR OPPOSITION. SANDERS PHILIP Ã­ OF THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION ARE BIPARTISAN COMMISSION VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN MARCH -- TO OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT NOW FOR THE WITNESSES WILL BRING BACK COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. YES SIR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN I KNOW YOU -- STATED THAT -- LELAND HE MADE THE COMMENT I GUESS TO THE FBI OR WHATNOT BUT YOU KNOW I'VE KNOWN A NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT HAVE CANDIDATE COMMITTEES I DON'T HAVE ONE MYSELF. BUT I HAVE NOT KNOWN THEM TO USE IT FOR THE PURPOSES THAT YOU'RE STATING SO HOW OFTEN DOES IT ACTUALLY HAPPEN I DON'T HAVE ANY PERCENTAGE BUT I KNOW THE MERCURY NEWS ARTICLE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN MENTIONED. THAT NEARLY THREE MILLION DOLLARS SPENT BY THESE COMMITTEES SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN ONLY ONE DOLLAR OUT OF EVERY FOUR WAS USED TO HELP. PASS OR KILL MEASURES THE BALANCE WAS MANAGED BY THE CANDIDATE -- TOO YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY PROMOTE THEMSELVES. PAYMENTS ON THEIR VARIETY OF WAYS AND I KNOW WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE SEEN IT USED A LOT. ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN CITIES ELECTIONS. IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY. I WONDER IF MAYBE IT'S MORE OF A LOCAL ISSUE THAT I I'M THE YOU KNOW WE ALL TEND TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DO RIGHT I'M THINKING OF OTHER SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY FOLKS SO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE NIELSEN DUMP. LET ME ASK A QUESTION. FOUR NINE KENNEDY CONTROLLED BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES IS THERE A PROHIBITION ON THE SUPPORTERS FEATURING A PARTICULAR ELECTED OFFICIAL. SLANG DO NOT ABOUT NOT THAT I AM AWARE OF THERE ARE THERE LIMITS THAT THEIR PPVS PUT INTO PLACE -- LIMITS THAT WHEN A ABOUT MAJOR COMMITTEE DOES FEATURE CANADA AT THE BEHEST OF THE CANDIDATE THAT THEN. THE CONTRIBUTION LIMITS START TO KICK IN AFTERWARDS -- BUT THAT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT I'M AWARE OF RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE US SENATOR ON UNDER YOU WOULD HAVE TO REPORTED AS AN IN KIND CONTRIBUTION. TO YOUR CAMPAIGN AND WILL YOU KNOW WE'RE LIMITED ON OUT SO. THAT'S PROBABLY HOUSE CONTROL MAYBE INDIRECTLY. I WOULD ASSUME BECAUSE IT'S AN IN KIND CONTRIBUTION WHEN THEY'RE PROMOTING YOU. RIGHT. SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY COMMON CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A BALLOT MEASURE AND THEY FEATURED A PARTICULAR ELECTED OFFICIAL WHATEVER. AMOUNT OF FOR EXAMPLE TELEVISION ADVERTISING THAT WOULD ALL BE AN IN KIND CONTRIBUTION. I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPORT THAT I AM NOT THE MVPS. DECIDER ON THAT BALLOT MY GUESS IS IF IT WAS SUBMITTED TO THEM OUT SO. YOU KNOW. NOT REPORTED ON MY FORM THAT I WAS PROMOTED WITH -- LET'S SAY A STATEWIDE BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY I THINK THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM IF. IT IF IT WAS DONE WITH LET'S SEE AN INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE AND I HAD NO CONNECTION OR MY CONSULTANTS. THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A TOTAL REVIEW OF WHAT MY INVOLVEMENT IN THAT WAS. LOOKING AT ME THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE OF A PHONE A FRIEND HERE SO YES -- THE PPC. HI SENATOR -- SO THAT YOU MIGHT MY QUESTION BY POLITICAL QUESTION YEAH -- IN YOUR HYPOTHETICAL IF -- THE IN OR EVER COMMITTEE HAD FEATURED A A CANDIDATE OR AN ELECTED OFFICIAL -- IN AN ADVERTISEMENT -- AND OF COURSE THE CONTEXT DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S EXPRESS ADVOCACY WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT THAT OFFICIAL IF IT'S SIMPLY JUST FEATURES THE OFFICIAL. AND THE OFFICIAL -- APPROVES THE FEATURING OF THAT OF THEIR IMAGE -- OUR CURRENT REGULATIONS WOULD TRIGGER -- A CONTRIBUTION LIMIT OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES -- IF THAT FEATURING AT THE BEHEST THE CANADA OCCURRED IN THE LAST FORTY FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION. AND THAT IS OUR DEREGULATION IS AN APPLICATION OF A STATUTE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE VOTERS AND PROPOSITION. THIRTY FOUR OKAY AND WHAT IF FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE A COMMITTEE FORMED IN OPPOSITION TO A A BALLOT MEASURE CANDIDATE CONTROL COMMITTEE FORMED IN OPPOSITION TO A BALLOT MEASURES THAT. WITH THIS. LAW PERTAIN TO THAT SITUATION AS WELL. I'M NOT SURE AND YOU MAY KNOW LOVE THE WORDS LET'S SAY. COMMON CAUSE HAS AN INITIATIVE THAT THE BALLOT MEASURE. AND THEN THERE'S A CANDIDATE CONTROLLED COMMITTEE THE THEN FORMS TO OPPOSE THAT BALLOT MEASURE WITH THE RESTRICTIONS BE IN PLACE FOR THE OPPOSITION AS WELL AS THE PROMOTION NO. NO. IT WOULD JUST BE FOR THE CANDIDATE CONTROLLED COMMITTEE AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE OF COMMON CAUSE HE IS PROMOTING SOMETHING. AND I'M THE CANDIDATE AND I AM A BALLOT MEASURE. TO I HAVE A MEASURE TO THE POLLS THAT I WOULD BE AONGST PROBABLY OTHERS WHO ARE OPPOSING IT ALSO. HI WOULD BE LIMITED TO THE FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AS A SENATOR. DO YOU SEE ANY. OF THE CONTRIBUTION TO ME FOR THAT PURPOSE. THE END DO YOU SEE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITY SAVE ANY LEGAL INFIRMITIES. TO THIS MEASURE. I'LL ASK YOU THE PPC HERE MISTER LINE -- WE IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE RAISES THAT BBC REYES DIDN'T BUT THE THE THE CLEARLY. LIMITS ON ON CONDITIONS CANDIDATES ARE ARE QUITE CONSTITUTIONAL THIS IS A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION IF IT'S pWOULD BELIEVE THAT THAT THIS WOULD BE CONSTITUTIONAL THE FTC HAS A DIFFERENT -- THE BASIS OF OUR OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE THE COMMISSION FOR BELIEVES THIS PROPOSAL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL -- BASED ON THE CURRENT -- PRESIDENT -- ESTABLISH AND RENT CONTROL -- IN THE RENT CONTROL CASE -- IT IS A CANDY CONTROL BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BALANCE OF THESE ACTIVITIES IT IS MORE BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTED IS CANADA COMMITTEE. SO I THINK THAT'S HOW WE CAME TO THAT POSITION OF OPPOSITION ZIP PPC EVER. ASIDE THAT A CANDIDATE CONTROL BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY BECOMES BASICALLY THE COMMITTEE. FOR THE PURPOSE. EXCLUSIVELY OR PREDOMINANTLY TO SUPPORT A CANDIDATE -- LAND THEREFORE BASICALLY REVOKE ITS I SUPPOSE STATUS IS A IS A ABOUT MEASURE COMMITTEE -- I CAN'T THINK OF A CASE BUT IF THAT WAS TO OCCUR -- THERE WOULD BE -- A NUMBER OF ISSUES FOR THAT COMMITTEE -- BECAUSE THAT COMMITTEE WOULD THEN -- SAVE A CANDIDATE HAD A CHARACTER BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEE AND THEY USE THE MONEY THAT WAS COLLECTED ABOVE THE LIMITS. AND THEN THE USE THAT MONEY TO PROMOTE THEMSELVES FOR THEIR REELECTION USING EXPRESS ADVOCACY -- WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT A VIOLATION OF THE EXPENDITURE RULES THAT WE HAVE ON CAN'T GET TO A BALLOT MEASURE COMMITTEES -- WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT AN ELECTION COMMITTEE -- AND THEN WE WOULD ESSENTIALLY -- WE MAY LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE NOT SUBJECT TO LIMIT NOW SUBJECT TO WOMEN AND LOOK AT THE SPENDING. OF THAT COMMITTEE -- AND NOT TO MENTION IF -- THE THE CANDIDATE ALREADY HAD AN ELECTION COMMITTEE THAN THEY WOULD VIOLATE ONE TAKE ACCOUNT ROLE ON BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH THAT TO CANADA COMMITTEES. OKAY THE CENTER BATES THE AT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND AND I'M NOT PREPARED TODAY TO SUPPORT IT BUT I BUT I AM PREPARED TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE DOES DESERVE SOME SCRUTINY -- BUT I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS THAT THE BUT SHOULD BE CHANGED -- THE US SUPREME COURT AND THE NEXT SESSION OR SESSIONS THEREAFTER WILL DO SO BUT I'M NOT PREPARED RIGHT NOW IS TO SUPPORT IT BUT I'M HERE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YES SIR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WOULD JUST SAY I FEEL THE SAME WAY I THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT I THINK IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK. SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP AS WELL MISTER CHAIR IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT AND I DO THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY TRY SOME OTHER AVENUE TO TO GET IT TO WHERE WE ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT OUT OF THE OFFICE ARE. NON SUPPORTED -- ALL RIGHT OF SO THERE'S BEEN A MOTION MADE -- MAP SECTOR IF YOU CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS ON BURKE ALL NUMBERED NO NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG. LEYVA. LEYVA NO STERN. SO CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU -- THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTARY AND I CERTAINLY THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THERE'S A LOOPHOLE IS THIS THE FIX FOR IT. I THINK I'M HEARING WE'RE NT THERE YET THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTARY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR -- NEXT -- CENTER MORLOCK [inaudible] ABOUT. THEM THE POINT. SIR MORE LUCK THE OF FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WAS JUST IN ROOM ONE ONE TWO ACROSS THE HALL AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT ONE ONE THREE HAS PIPED IN MUSIC SO THANK. YES I WAS IS JUST FOR YOU BUT I I THINK CENTER BATES ALSO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MUSIC SO -- YEARS MUSIC'S BETTER THOUGH I I GOT TO TELL YOU THAT. MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN NEWPORT BEACH OPPOSED THE BUILDING OF A CONDOMINIUM HIGH RISE TOWER THAT WAS APPROVED. BY CITY COUNCIL AS APPALLED CITY CODE PROVISIONS. IN ORDER TO GATHER THE NECESSARY SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY A BALLOT MEASURE THE OPPONENTS WERE REQUIRED TO ATTACH A COPY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. SOME ONE THOUSAND PAGES TO EACH PETITION DOCUMENT. THIS WAS VERY CLEVER BUT IT WAS ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE ALTHOUGH I MAY NOT HAVE NECESSARILY AGREED WITH THE OPPOSITION OF ADDING NEW HOUSING I ALSO DO NOT AGREE WITH OBSTRUCTIONIST TACTICS TO DIS INCENTIVIZE CITIZENS. FROM PARTICIPATING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. A SUMMARY OF THE E. I. R. SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ADEQUATE. SB THREE FIFTY NINE TRIES TO FIND A COMPROMISE BETWEEN AN ONEROUS DOCUMENT AND NO PROJECT DETAILS AT ALL. I'M ASKING THAT ATTACHING SPECIFIED DECLARATIONS TO REFERENDUM PETITIONS WE ARE RESPONSIBLEIN POSITION AND NOT A CUMBERSOME OBSTACLE TO EXERCISE TO THE EXERCISE OF PARTICIPATING IN GOVERNMENT. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE A KEY WITNESS. THANK YOU SIR WATER SKINNER YES YOU. THIS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SUSAN SKINNER AND I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO USE YOUR LEGISLATIVE SUPER POWERS TO WRITE OF SERIOUS ROCK. I'M ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT SENATOR MORLOCKS SB THREE FIFTY NINE WHICH WILL PREVENT FUTURE ABUSES OF THE REFERENDUM PROCESS. IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE NEWPORT BEACH CITY COUNCIL APPROVED A TWENTY FIVE STORY CONDOMINIUM TOWER. KNOWING THAT MY GROUP IS GOING TO RUN A REFERENDUM TO OVERTURN THEIR DECISIONS THEY ADDED THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED UNNECESSARY PAGES TO THE TEXT OF THE ORDINANCE INCLUDING THE ENTIRETY I ARE IN THE LAND USE ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN. THEY DID THIS BECAUSE THE COURTS HAVE HELD THAT ANY DOCUMENTS ADDED TO AN ORDINANCE MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE REFERENDUM PETITION. CHALLENGES THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTION WE ENDED UP WITH THIS PETITION. DON'T HURT YOURSELF I WANT TO BEEN DOING THIS A LOT. THIS IS. ONE IT HAS ROOM FOR A HUNDRED SIGNATURES WE NEED EIGHT THOUSAND IN ORDER TO QUALIFY THE REFERENDUM. BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTION -- EACH PETITIONCOST ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PRINT AND USE TEN POUNDS OF PAPER THEY COLLECTIVELY COST FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PRINT THESE PETITIONS. TO HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO GATHER THE NECESSARY SIGNATURES AND THE PRINTING OF THESE PETITIONS REQUIRED NINE DAYS. THE NEWPORT BEACH CITY COUNCIL KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING BECAUSE ONE OF THE COUNCILMEN MADE AN IMPASSIONED PLEA TO HIS COLLEAGUES NOT TO MAKE THE REFERENDUM LOOK LIKE A PHONE BOOK. WE WERE ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THE SIGNATURES NEEDED THE BARRIERS PLACED BY OUR CITY COUNCIL CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED. AND A LESS WELL ORGANIZED GROUP THE LOSS OF NINE DAYS TO PRINT THE PETITIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL. IN A LESS AFFLUENT CITY THE FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR COST OF THE PETITIONS WERE SHUT DOWN THE EFFORT IMMEDIATELY. THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO REFERENDUM DOES NOT DIMINISH DIMINISH THE MALFEASANCE SHOWN BY THE COUNCIL. THE FACT THAT THEY COULD USE THEIR LEGISLATIVE POWERS TO BLOCK OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WITH IMPUNITY REQUIRES IN MY OPINION SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE LAW. I MADE A COMPLAINT TO THE GRAND JURY AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE BOTH OF WHOM OPENED AN INVESTIGATION AND BOTH OF WHOM CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT A CRIME FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO HAVE TAKEN THIS ACTION. THUS THE ONLY AVENUE OPEN TO PREVENT FREE FUTURE ABUSES IS THE LEGISLATIVE PATH. DEMOCRACY WORKS BEST WHEN DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES ARE RESPECTED. THE RIGHT TO PETITION ONE'S GOVERNMENT IS AMONG THE MOST PRECIOUS RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL TO PROTECT THE DEMOCRATIC BALANCE OF POWER IN FUTURE REFERENDUMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MS SKINNER -- YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN HANGING AROND CENTER MORE LIKE TOO MUCH BECAUSE THE REST OF US DID NOT HAVE SUPER SUPER HUMAN PWERS SO. I KNOW YOU DO. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT -- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS THE QUESTIONS THE QUESTIONS HERE'S A A COUPLE ISSUES -- ONE THAT I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON CENTER MORE LIKE IS KIDS -- MAYBE IT'S PROTECTING A BROTHER OR SISTER IN THE BAR IS THE SEVEN DAY TURNAROUND IS IS VERY VERY QUICK -- SO AT AT AND LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON PERHAPS EXTENDING THAT SEVEN DAY PERIOD OR DEFINING IT AS BUSINESS DAYS OR SOMETHING THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- AND IT'S IT COULD BE QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO BE ABLE TO PUT THAT TOGETHER. THE BE LOTS OF INPUT I AM SURE -- AS WE'VE EXPERIENCE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO ARE YOU A U. AMENABLE TO TO WORK ON THAT TIME PERIOD I'LL RESPECT YOUR SUPER POWERS RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU -- IT ALSO AND JUST SOME ISSUES WITH WITH THE THE THE TIMING -- THE SEVEN DAYS THAT THE THIRTY DAYS THAT KIND OF THING I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE HAVE. PROVIDED SUFFICIENT TIME TO BE ABLE TO TO DO AN ADEQUATE ANALYSIS IN SUMMARY SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE LEGAL FIGHTS OVER WHETHER THE PHONE BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE. SO IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE AMENABLE. TO TO WORK WITH US ON ON THOSE ISSUES AND THEN I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. I'M I'M I'M AMENABLE AND I GOT A WORK WITH THE DOCTOR SKINNER AS WELL MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S. HAPPY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOOD FORM. BUT THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING. TO TO DO.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- I APPRECIATE [inaudible] YOUR FORBEARANCE -- FOR ADDITIONAL AUTHORS. YES I WAS JUST OVER ACROSS THE HALL AND WITH ONE OF YOUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS CHAIRING THE NOT TO RESOURCES WANT TO COMMITTEE SO -- HE'S CLOSE BY IF YOU NEED FOR VOTE. I'VE IF YOU IF IF I MAY I'D LOVE TO PRESENT SB. TWO TWELVE PLEASE ENCLOSURES THANK YOU SO MUCH -- MINSITER MEMBERS AT THIS BILL SB. TWO TWELVE SIMPLY AUTHORIZES GENERAL LOST CITIES. GENERAL ON COUNTIES. IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO UTILIZE TO MAJORITY WINNER VOTING METHODS FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS SO ONE OPTION WOULD BE -- AND BY THE WAY ALL OF THIS IS PERMISSIVE A TEST IF THE LOCALS WANT TO DO IT THEY CAN DO IT. UNDER THIS BILL -- IT'S BASICALLY AFFORDS A RIGHT THAT IT CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR CHARTER CITIES. I TO THE GENERAL OUT FOLKS IN THE COULD. YOU GIVE TO ADDITIONAL OPTIONS ONE OF THE TWO ROUND RUNOFF. AND THE OTHER IS RANKED CHOICE VOTING. UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW VOTERS IN GENERAL I CITIES HAVE TO ELECT THEIR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS USED A VERY PARTICULAR WAY IT'S A PLURALITY WINNER VOTING SYSTEM -- SO YOU CAN GET. IN IN A CROWDED FIELD LET'S SAY THERE'S A SEAT FOR ONE YOU KNOW OF OF OF THE VOTE FOR ONE SEAT. YOU CAN GET 20% OF ALL IN YOUR THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER -- IF THERE'S A LOT OF CANDIDATES AND YOU THE TOP VOTER VOTE GETTER -- CHARTER CITIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF COURSE TO ADOPT MAJORITY WINNER VOTING METHODS LIKE A TWO ROUND RUNOFF OR RANGERS VOTING IF THEY WANT -- TO SO AT THE AT THE CONCERN I HAVE COMING TO ALL THIS IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. LOCALLY ELECTED BODIES THAT TRULY ENJOY THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION THAT. ARE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND HERE'S THE SHOCKING STAT -- CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE DUE TO ANALYSIS OF CITY ELECTIONS FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND FOUNDED IN RACES WITH THREE OR MORE CANDIDATES NEARLY HALF OF THE CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES WERE ELECTED. WITH LESS THAN MAJORITY SUPPORT -- SO ALRIGHT FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE SEEM BY THESE TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS -- ONE IS THE THE TWO ROUND. RUNOFF RIGHT WHAT SO YOU HAVE A A WIDE OPEN RACE FOR THE PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL THE TOP TWO VOTE GETTERS RUNOFF AGAINST EACH OTHER WE ALL HAD TO GO THROUGH HER CELLS AND WE RUNNING FOR THE STATE SENATE. I SUCH A SIMPLE SYSTEM. THE OTHER SYSTEM OF COURSE THE RAIN CHOICE VOTING. ELECTION MAJORITY WINTER BUT IN A SINGLE ACTION EACH VOTER HAS ONE VOTE THE RANK THE CANDIDATES IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE. ON AND THE RESULTS ARE TABULATED ROUNDS IF NO CANDIDATE RECEIVES A MAJORITY VOTE IN THE FIRST ROUND AND THIS PROCEEDS UNTIL A CANDIDATE. RECEIVES MORE THAN 50% -- BASED ON PEOPLE SECOND AND THIRD CHOICE AND SO ON VOTES SO WE HAVE RANGERS VOTING IN A NUMBER CITIES AFTER MUNICIPAL ELECTION SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND BERKELEY SANLEANDRO. IT CETERA -- AND ALL THIS BILL DOES IS GIVES THE GENERAL US CITIES THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT THE CHARTER CITIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO NOW SO DOZEN IMPOSES UPON THEM. IT JUST SAYS THEY CAN USE THIS AS AN OPTION IF THEY SO CHOOSE -- IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S UP TO THEM LOCALLY. SO MY THOUGHT IS IS THAT -- BY GIVING THEM THIS THESE ADDITIONAL TOOLS -- THAT YOU'LL GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY CAN UTILIZE TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS ACTUALLY ENJOYS SUPPRT FROM. A MAJORITY OF THEIR A LECTOR PART OF THE DEAL HERE COURSES AND AND THE CITY THE COMMITTEE WAS VERY. YOU KNOW PASSION ABOUT THIS IF THEY THE JURISDICTION IS TO CHOOSE TO A DOCTOR ENTERS VOTING BEHALF TO ADOPT A COMPREHENSIVE VOTER EDUCATION PLAN THEY HAV. TO HAVE -- VOTER EDUCATION FOR TWO GENERAL ELECTION SO THERE'S A SLOW ROLLOUT TO THIS ANY WOULD REALLY INVOLVES MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE PROPERLY INFORMED. SO THAT -- THAT YOU KNOW THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING THEMSELVES INTO BUT WITH THIS AND WITH THIS I HAVE HERE TO TESTIFY -- ON SUPPORT SUPPORT OF THE BILL PEDRO HERNANDEZ FROM VERBAL CALIFORNIA ALSO CARE BRINSON. FROM THE RIGHT CHOICE VOTING RESOURCE CENTER AND I RESPECT YESTERDAY WILL. GREAT -- MY NAME IS BETTER KNOWN AS ON THE SENIOR POLICY COORDINATOR AT FAIR BUT CALIFORNIA -- THERE WILL CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THAT A HEALTHY LONG LASTING DEMOCRACY RELIES ON EVERY CITIZEN HAVING A RIGHTS TO VOTE THAT CAN TRULY CONTRIBUTE TO MEANINGFUL REPRESENTATION -- AS CURLEY'S CURRENTLY GENERAL ON CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ONLY HOLD PLURALITY WINNER ELECTIONS. IN WHICH THE CANDOR WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS -- EVEN IF THE MAJORITY DID NOT VOTE FOR THAT CANDIDATE WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IN CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED -- THE COMMON CAUSE REPORT DID SHOW THAT 42% OF SINGLE ELECTIONS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WERE ELECTED WITH LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF VOTES -- THIS CAN REALLY. UNDERMINE VOTER CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS IN GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL BELIEVES THAT CALIFORNIA RESTRICTIONS SHOULD NOT BE PRECLUDED FROM ADOPTING VOTING SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW FOR A MORE REPRESENTATIVE OUTCOMES -- THE CURRENT LAW CHARTER CITIES AND COUNTIES MAY USE RUNOFF ELECTIONS ANDRANGE WAS VOTING THIS MEANS ROUGHLY 75% OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO USE THESE METHODS. THAT ARE LOST CITIES IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT WOULD NEED TO PASS A CHARTER AMENDMENT WHICH COULD MEAN A YEAR OR TWO DOWN THE LINE IN WHICH THEY CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT OPTION. AND THAT COMES WITH OTHER COMPLICATED ISSUES -- SO THIS IS ENTIRELY PERMISSIVE BILL TO ALLOW THESE CITIES THAT HAPPEN OPTION TO AND LIKE THE REPRESENTED BY MAJORITY. ON THIS BILL IS NECESSARY ENSURE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO ADOPT AN ELECTION AT THE BUT STREETS THEIR LOCAL NEEDS -- MILLIE TO DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT WORKS BETTER FOR EVERYONE -- WE'VE SEEN RANGE WAS VOTING RESULT IN HIGHER PARTED TO PARTICIPATION RATES. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TURNOUT IN ALL JURISDICTIONS HOLDING RANCHERS BUT ELECTIONS TO PASS PROJECTIONS FAVORITE CISCO HAD MORE VOTERS IN THE RAIN CHOICE VOTING CONTESTS FOR MAYOR. THEN VOTER FOR GOVERNOR AND SENTE. WHICH WERE NOT RANGE WAS PUTTING CONTESTS -- IT WAS THE SECOND HIGHEST VOTE TOTAL IN SAN FRANCISCO MERYL HISTORY. EXIT POLLS OF SIXERS SECTIONS THAT USE RANGE WAS VOTING FOR ON AVERAGE 84% OF VOTERS REPORT THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE SYSTEM EXTREMELY VERY OR SOMEWHAT WELL -- IN ADDITION SB TWO ONE TWO REQUIRES YOUR SUCCESS EDUCATE VOTERS ABOUT RANGE WAS VOTING TO MAKE SURE. VOTERS ARE AWARE OF THE CHANGE THAT FOR THE FIRST TWO ELECTIONS -- THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TESTIFYING FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL I'VE. WE AYE ARJA AND NAY VOTE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ALL THE WAY FROM CHARLESTON SOUTH CAROLINA -- MY NAME IS KAREN BRINSON BELL AND I'VE CONDUCTED ELECTIONS. FOR MORE THAN A DECADE INCLUDING CITY AND DISTRICT INSTANT RUNOFF ELECTIONS AND I WAS PART. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION TEAM FOR STATE WIDE USE OF RIGHT CHOICE VOTING IN A NORTH CAROLINA ELECTION FOR THE COURT OF APPEALS SEAT THAT BECAME VACANT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST STATEWIDE USE OF OUR CV. IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND WE IMPLEMENTED IN JUST EIGHTY SIX DAYS -- I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE RIGHT CHOICE VOTING RESOURCE CENTER WERE NON ADVOCACY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WE'RE FOCUSED ON EDUCATION AND JUST THE SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES IN ELECTION MINISTRATION PARTICULARLY FOR RIGHT CHOICE VOTING. CURRENTLY RCV WE'VE TOUCHED ON THIS BUT IT IS USED IN A LEVIN US CITIES INCLUDING MINNEAPOLIS MINNESOTA SAN FRANCISCO. SANTA FE NEW MEXICO WAS THE MOST RECENT. CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS HAS ACTUALLY USE THE MULTI WINNER FORMER RIGHT CHOICE VOTING FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE YEARS. OZ SO IT'S PROVEN IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE STATE OF MAINE USED RCV OR ITS STATE AND FEDERAL PRIMARIES. AND THEN FOR ITS US HOUSE AND SENATE GENERAL ELECTION. FOURTEEN ADDITIONAL CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE APPROVED RIGHT CHOICE VOTING FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS. BOB THIS IMPLEMENTATION ADMINISTRATION PRACTICES TO DRAW FROM THAT MAY BE HELPFUL IN YOUR DECISION MAKING. RIGHT CHOICE VOTING ELECTIONS REALLY ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER ELECTION. IMPLEMENTATION A RIGHT CHOICE VOTING FOR JURISDICTION FOLLOWS MANY OF THE SAME PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES THAT WERE CUSTOM TO AN ELECTION ADMINISTRATION. CONSIDER THAT YOU STILL HAVE FILING YOU STILL HAVE A CERTAIN DAY THAT YOU BURDEN THE VOTE REPLACES OPEN. TESTING AND PREPARATIONS ARE FOR THE SAME. JURISDICTIONS DO NOT HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL ANY LONGER BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICES BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE THOSE PROCEDURES AND RESOURCES IN PLACE. I SAID THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE APPLIED AT A LOCAL LEVEL OF A VERY RULE LEVEL UP TO A VERY URBAN AREA. WITH GOOD INSTRUCTIONS WE KNOW THE VOTERS DO YOU UNDERSTAND VOTER EDUCATION CAN INVOLVE AS LITTLE OR AS MUCH OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE PERMITTED. SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE CAMPAIGNS AND OTHERS LIKE NORTH CAROLINA AND MAIN HAVE BOTH HAD NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE ASKED TO EXECUTE -- OR CONDUCT A RIGHT CHOICE VOTING ELECTION. IDEALLY RCV EDUCATION AND OUTREACH THAT'S CONSIDERED IN THE BILL WOULD COMPLEMENT EXISTING EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS AND WE REALLY KNOW FROM PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL AND INEXPENSIVE VOTER EDUCATION METHOD. IS VERBAL AND WRITTEN INSTRUCTION WHEN THE VOTER PRESENTS THEMSELVES TO VOTE -- LAST BUT NOT LEAST ALL SHARE SOME DATA WITH YOU THE RECENT ELECTIONS IN SANTA FE AND MINNEAPOLIS THEY ARE ILLUSTRATE THE VOTERS DO UNDERSTAND HAVE A PROFICIENCY MARKING THERE ARE CD BALLOTS. IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SANTA FE VOTERS USE RCV FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ELECTING THE CITY'S MAYOR AND IN TO CITY COUNCIL RACES. 96% OF THE BALLOTS THAT WERE CAST COUNT COUNTED IN THE FINAL ROUND OF THE MAY WORLD ALEXIAN AND JUST ONE THIRD OF 1% HAD NO CAST VOTE IN THE CONTEST. FOR MAYOR. MINNEAPOLIS HAS NOW USE OUR CD AND THREE ELECTION CYCLES AND LOOKING AT THEIR DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ONLY ONE FIFTH OF 1% OF BALLOTS. HEAD OVER VOTE ERRORS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AND SIMILARLY WITH THIRTY FIVE MAYORAL CANDIDATES IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN THE ERROR RATE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT LET US KNOW HOW WE CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NO FURTHER WITNESSES WELL HERE WE GO. GATHERED FROM SANTA CRUZ AND I AM A PASSIONATE SUPPORTER FRANK CHOICE WRITING -- YOU JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF THANK YOU.

HI MY NAME'S DAVID JACOBS I'M WITH THE SECOND CHAPTER REPRESENT US I URGE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. YOU. HI MY NAME. MY NAME IS MIKE WILSON THIRD DISTRICT SUPERVISOR FROM THE COUNTY F HUMBOLDT. ARE COUNTY -- ENDORSED THIS BILL -- SPECIFICALLY -- AS A RESPONSE TO THE EXTENSION OF THE OF THE PRIMARY SEASON TO MARCH WHICH IS NOW MAKING AN ALMOST TWO YEAR FIFTEEN ELECTORAL CYCLE -- FOR FOR GENERAL LAW COUNTIES -- BUT IN ALSO. CREATES THE POTENTIAL OF TEN MONTHS -- LAME DUCK INCUMBENCY AS WELL -- WHICH IS ALSO UNFAIR TO OUR VOTERS SO. WE WOULD LIKE TO AT LEAST HAVE THE OPTION TO DISCUSS A ONE AND DONE OPTION IN TERMS OF HAVING AN ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. SO THAT WE CAN -- NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM THANKS. THANK YOU UP OPPOSITION AND IN UP OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT. COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATE. OF BILLS BEEN MOVED. OF ALL RIGHT MA'AM SECTOR IF YOU'D OF SELLER BUT BROWN I JUST WANT TO ECHO THAT WE DID WE DID SOMETHING DRAMATIC IT WAS THERE ARE SOME GOOD REASONS FOR A BY MOVING THE PRIMARY FOR TO MARCH WE REALLY HAVE. AND SHUT UP THE SYSTEM A BIT IN WAYS THAT I DON'T THINK WE FULLY ANTICIPATED THIS IS ONE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WAY OF OF OF INSURANCE WE DON'T HAVE. LAME DUCK IN COMMENTS I WILL POINT OUT THAT BOTH OF THE WOMEN VOTERS ANALLY CALIFORNIA CITIES OF COME ON AND ONE SUPPORT. BECAUSE IT'S PERMISSIVE IT GIVES TOOLS AND IT WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL HAVE MORE COUNCILS THAT TRULY REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THE CENTER [inaudible] MA'AM SECTOR. THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS NUMBER. NUMBER I NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG. LEYVA LEYVA AYE STERN. YOU BILLS ON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENT. YEAH. HIS OWN MARK. YOU KNOW. THE PROPOSED. ALL RIGHT -- SEN AROUND -- SB SIX FORTY ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND I FIRST WANT TO ACCEPT THE MEMBER AS OUTLINED IN ANALYSIS. AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. I THOSE OF US FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A PROLIFERATION OF SPECIAL ELECTION STRUCK CALIFORNIA OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. AND THERE'S CURRENTLY A PRETTY SHORT WINDOW OF ONLY A FEW WEEKS IN WHICH SPECIAL ACTIONS CAN OCCUR. OUR CURRENT LAW DOES PERMIT COUNTIES TO CONSOLIDATE A SPECIAL ACTION WITH THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED STATEWIDE ELECTION WERE LOCAL ELECTION WITHIN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OF THE VACANCY. THIS BILL AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED WILL EXTEND THE THAT CONSOLIDATION TIMELINE TO TUTOR DAYS. AND ALSO A LOT OF CONSOLIDATION WITH ANY. OUR ELECTION WITH YOUR WITH ANY ELECTION OCCURRING WITHIN THE JURISDICTION -- A PORTLY THIS CHANGE GIVES THE GOVERNOR MORE FLEXIBILITY TO WORK LOCAL COUNTIES TO DETERMINE THE BEST ELECTION DAY FOR SPECIAL ACTIONS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF. THERE IS A AN EXISTING PECIAL EXISTING REGULAR ELECTION OR SPECIAL ACTION IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IN SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTRICT. THAT -- WITH AS MANY VACANCY. INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU KNOW ONE ELECTION ONE WEEK IN ANOTHER ELECTION THE NEXT WEEK WE ALREADY HAVE SUCH PROBLEMS WITH TURN OUT. LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GIVE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LOCALS MORE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE -- WE HAD A SITUATION IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE WERE HAVING A SPECIAL ELECTION EVERY FOUR WEEKS IN THE SAME AREA ONE FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD IN THE CITY COUNCIL AND THERE WAS A ASSEMBLY. A NINE AND THE CAN THE CONGRESS AND IT WAS JUST A A CRAZY MIX OF ELECTIONS HAPPENING -- BEING A MONTH AFTER MONTH AND IF WE'D HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME MORE CONSOLIDATION. IT COULD HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN AND VOTE TOGETHER VOTE ALL ONE DOLLAR AND HAVE A JUST A SIMPLER SYSTEM IT WOULD BE LESS COSTLY AND LESS. LESS LESS HECTIC AMID VOTERS WERE JUST LIVE IT WITH YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO BE GOOD RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS BUT IT WAS CRAZY HOW MANY TIMES THEY WERE BEING ASKED TO VOTE. IN THE SAME AREA -- FOR DIFFERENT ELECTION SO THIS HELPS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IF IT GIVES FLEXIBILITY DOESN'T REQUIRE -- BUT ALLOWS THE GOVERNOR TO TALK WITH THE LOCALS AND FIGURE OUT THE BEST PATH MOVING FORWARD WE DO HAVE AGENCIES. AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU WITH THIS IS A SPORT. OPPOSITION OF BRING IT BACK ALL RIGHT. DID YOU EVER ON THE ILLICIT COMMITTEE CHAIR THE THREE PARTY CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT WE SENT A BILL OR WE SEND INFORMATION IN BUT I GUESS SOMEHOW GOT LOST IN THE SYSTEM.

FOR TWO THREE FIVE FOUR TWO THREE SB FORTY THREE THANK YOU I'M CENTER NIELSEN -- SB EVIL FOR TWENTY THREE IS A SIMPLE BILL -- HAS TWO COMPONENTS TO IT IS IT'S SPONSORED BY THE F.

WE ARE SPONSORS OF THIS BUT I WANT TO THANK SENATOR ON BOTH FOR AUTHORING -- THIS IMPORTANT BILL THAT -- THE DESERT THE EXCITING TOPIC OF BANK ACCOUNTS FOR CAMPAIGNS -- THE CAMPAIGNS -- RIGHT NOW I'M ONLY CANDY COMMITTEES ARE -- REQUIRED TO CREATE THANK ACCOUNTS TO SEGREGATE THEIR ACCOUNTS FROM -- AND NON CAMPAIGN -- FUNDS -- THE WE WE HAVE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT ALL OTHER COMMITTEES DO SO FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THEIR CAMPAIGN ACCOUNTS BE SEPARATE -- FROM NON CAMPAIGN FUNDS AND SO IT IS FOR THE MOST PART A BEST PRACTICE IN THE INDUSTRY -- AND IN THOUGH AND AND IN OUR FIELD AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BOUGHT THAT BREAKS. THAT BEST PRACTICE HERE -- TO CALIFORNIA -- THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL -- DEALS WITH REDUCTION OF BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS -- OBVIOUSLY HAVING A BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER IS -- IS IMPORTANT TO BANKING -- AND BUT PROTECTING IT FROM PUBLIC CONSUMPTION IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO PREVENT A POTENTIAL ABUSE AND FRAUD FROM -- EVIL DOERS OUT THERE WHO WHO MAY WISH -- TO TAKE FUNDS OR OR TEND TO WRITE BAD OR FAKE CHECKS FROM I'M CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES -- WHO YOU'RE CHEN PURPOSE COMMITTEES ARE PRIMARILY FORM COMMITTEE SINCE -- OR EVEN CAN'T A COMMITTEES AND SO WE ARE -- THEN IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL AS THE SPONSORS AND WE HOPE TO HAVE YOUR I FELT THANK YOU.

I'M I'M NOT AWARE THE CONFLICT ON ESTÃ¡ STRONG TO RESPOND TO THAT. I THINK THIS IS THAT YOU ARE YOU SPEAKING ABOUT. OF COURSE ANALYSIS YES CORY -- YES -- THE THE ISSUE THAT I'M HAS RECENTLY ARISEN -- IS THE ONE BANK ACCOUNT ROLE DOESN'T NECESSARY WORK FOR POLITICAL PARTIES WHO MUST HAVE ALL PURPOSE ACCOUNTS AND RESTRICTED USE ACCOUNTS -- SO IF YOU'RE POLITICAL PARTY AND YOUR PLAN ON SPENDING MONEY ON STATE CANDIDATES WHO ARE SUBJECT TO LIMIT. CONTRIBUTION LIMITS -- INDIVIDUALS CAN ONLY GIVE UP TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO THAT POLITICAL PARTY FOR THAT PURPOSE OF SUPPORTERS THE CANDIDATES -- ANY OTHER AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER ACCOUNT THE RESTRICTED ACCOUNT WHICH POLITICAL PARTIES CAN USE FOR ANY PURPOSE AND THERE'S NO LIMITS ON THEM -- AND SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ATTORNEYS -- FOR THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO TRY TO REMEDY THAT ISSUE IT'S NOT A HUGE CONFLICT. THE SMALL LITTLE MINISTRY TO THING THAT WE THINK -- WE HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION TO WE JUST NEED TO PROPOSE IT TO OUR COMMISSION AND AND AND HAVE THEM APPROVED AT THE LANGUAGES -- IT'S GOOD TO GO THAT THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES IN YOUR TO DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM OF CONCURRED OR REACH SOME AGREEMENT HERE THEN I BELIEVE SO YEAH.

THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR NOW SAYS AND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW -- SOME FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION TO REALLY TRY TO MAKE THIS WORK -- HAPPY TO ACCEPT THEM. FOR MANY VOTERS ARE ARE BALANCER. COMPLETELY ON INTERPRETABLE AND EVEN AFTER YOU'VE DONE YOUR DILIGENCE SAY BY REVIEWING% EDITORIALS OR DOING YOUR HOME AND HOMEWORK IN THE BALLOT GUIDE YOU FINALLY ARRIVE AT THAT SEMINAL MOMENT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE. TO CHECK THE BOX OR STAMP THE THE THE OR IN IN IN NEW CASES A TOUCH THE SCREEN. AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO ACTUALLY IS BEHIND -- THE MEASURE YOUR VOTING ON SO WE THINK THAT THIS MEASURE FEELS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT GAP BY GIVING VOTERS MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ACTUALLY MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THE ENDORSERS SUPPORTERS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE THEIR VOTING ON TO MAKE THESE ELECTIONS. AND THE VOTING PROCESS MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE -- SO WE WOULD BE MODIFYING THE BALLOT MEASURE LABELS WITH THIS MEASURE -- TO INCLUDE THE OFFICIAL SUPPORT OPPOSITION OF BALLOT MEASURES HOW WE THINK THAT PUTTING THIS OFFICIAL SUPPORT IN A WAY THAT. DOESN'T NECESSARILY -- NOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS BIAS IT JUST TOWARDS ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT -- BUT WITH A SORT OF FLEXIBLE WORD LIMIT BASED SYSTEM TO OCCUPY A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF SPACE WITH MAXIMUM IMPACT FOR DISCLOSURE -- ON AVERAGE A LISTING THREE SUPPORTERS AND THREE OPPONENTS WILL ACTUALLY ONLY HAD ABOUT TWENTY FIVE WORDS TO EACH SEVENTY FIVE WORD BALLOT LABEL FOR STATE BALLOT MEASURES -- SO WE DON'T THINK THE INCREASE IN LENGTH IS GOING TO BE -- EXCESSIVE -- AND THAT POWER THAT KNOWLEDGE IS IS WORTH -- THAT THAT SMALL INCREMENTAL -- EDITION -- TO OUR BALLOT TO FULFILL WHAT WE FEEL IS A CITIZENS MOST SACRED OBLIGATION WHICH IS NOT JUST TO BE A VOTER BUT TO BE AN INFORMED VOTER -- AND SO -- WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND INTRODUCE OUR SPONSORS LEGISLATION -- TRAVELING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN -- ALONG WITH -- EVAN MENTOR WITH THAT QUALITY CALIFORNIA MY RIGHT NOW SORRY.

THE THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING AND CHAIR OF THE SENATORS -- REALLY APPRECIATE THAT CENTER STERN STEPPING FORWARD TO LEAD ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL THE AS AS HE DESCRIBED AS NOTHING MORE -- MEANINGFUL THAN WITH THE VOTES THAT PEOPLE TAKE ON THE BALLOT THAT THE CURRENTLY IT WITH IT HAS A SEVENTY FIVE WORD VERY CONDENSED -- TITLE AND SUMMARY OF THE MUCH LONGER -- SUMMARY AND FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENTS IT'S VERY CONFUSING TO VOTERS -- IN THE HOT I HAVE EVEN HAD A INITIATIVES THAT WE SUPPORT WHERE YOU LOOK AT THE TWO SENTENCES THAT THEY CRAM IN THE CONDENSER MARIE. AND ONE I'M SURE THAT I WOULD SUPPORT THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT IT BASED OFF OF ONLY THOSE TWO SENTENCES SO KNOWING WHO THE SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS ARE -- THAT SIGNED THE OFFICIAL BALLOT PAMPHLET STATEMENTS WILL BE VERY HELPFUL WE THINK THAT WITH AMENDMENTS THAT THAT WE'RE ACCEPTING THAT WILL ALLOW THE PROPONENTS OF AN OPPONENT'S THE FLEXIBILITY TO DESCRIBE IN THE MOST INFORMATIVE WAY POSSIBLE. WHILE. LIMITING IT TO ONLY FIFTEEN WORDS IN EACH CASE SO -- WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION THE THE AMENDMENTS ACT ACTUALLY ARE PROPOSED FOR LATER INCLUSION THE NOT INCLUDED TODAY NOT THE BILL TODAY SO SOMETIME BETWEEN. NOW THEM IN THE NEXT STEP CORRECT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. I AM EVAN MAINTAIN I'M WITH CALIFORNIA VOICES FOR PROGRESS I'M ALSO THAT CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND CHAIR OF THE LGBT CAUCUS BUT I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF VOICES FOR PROGRESS TODAY. AND LEASES FOR PROGRESS GALVANIZES THE ADVOCACY OF BUSINESS LEADERS ENTREPRENEURS INVESTORS FOR ENTERPRISE AND OTHER PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS TO PROTECT OUR CLIMATE. STRENGTH IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND AB. ENSURE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. AND WE VIEW THIS BILL AS AN EASY AN IMPORTANT BALLOT TRANSPARENCY AND BETTER EDUCATION MAJOR. IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THIS DAY AND AGE THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THE BALLOT GUIDES ARE OFTEN CUMBERSOME AND CROSS COMPARING INFORMATION FROM THE BALLOT GUIDE. TO THE DEAD VOTER AB. BALLET IS A BIRD IS IN PROCESS FOR THE VOTER. AND AND I'M SORRY I WISH THAT I HAD MY COFFEE AND IS BURDENSOME PROCESS FOR THE VOTER. AND THAT IS IT FOR VOTER EVEN KNOWS -- REALIZES THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SAVED THE PAMPHLET.
