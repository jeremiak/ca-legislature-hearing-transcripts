MMHM. OKAY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SB SIXTY TWO MAKES CLEAR THAT A BUSINESS CONTRACTING TO HAVE GARMENTS MADE IS LIABLE FOR UNPAID WAGES TO THE SKILLED WORKERS WHO MAKE THE GARMENTS REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY LAYERSOF CONTRACTING THAT TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE ORIGINAL GARMENT WORKER PROTECTION ACT WAS PASSED WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TO UNDERLYING CAUSES OF CONTINUED WAGE THEFT AND IT'S BECAUSE IT BOB CALIFORNIA TO FALL BEHIND AND IT'S CAUSED WORKERS TO RELY N THE GARMENT RESTITUTION FUND FOR THE WAGES. THAT MEANS TAXPAYERS ARE ON THE HOOK TO SUBSIDIZE WHICH LEFT OFF FIRST FASHION BRANDS CREATE POVERTY WAGES THROUGH UNREALISTIC PRICING OF GARMENT ORDERS YET THEY HAVE NO LEGAL LIABILITY SECOND IS THE ARCHAIC SYSTEM OF PAYING BY PIECE RATE THAT KEEPS MINIMUM WAGE ALWAYS OUT OF REACH FOR WORKERS FRANKLY THESE ARE CONDITIONS OF EUROPEAN IMMIGRANT WOMEN FACED. OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. I AM VERY PROUD THAT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FASHION INDUSTRY BUSINESSES MOSTLY WOMEN LED SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LEADING THE CHARGE FOR ETHICAL WORKPLACE AND SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. THEY ENDORSE THIS BILL. TO PROTECT HIGHLY SKILLED GARMENT WORKERS. BECAUSE THE LOOPHOLES THAT MADE THE INDUSTRY AND THE LOOPHOLES THAT MADE THE INDUSTRY HOSTILE TO ETHICAL GARMENT COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE SWEATSHOPS THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE MADE IN THE USA REPRESENTS QUALITY AND WORK STANDARDS. IT'S NOT INTERESTING THAT IN ADDITION TO ALL THIS DISRUPTIONS TO THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN FROM THE PANDEMIC HAVE ACTUALLY MOTIVATED COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOP IN LOS ANGELES IN THIS STATE. FOR THE BENEFIT OF SKILLED LABOR BROWN'S REALIZE THAT THE ADVANTAGE OF A STRONG DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN REDUCING RISKS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THERE SHOULD BE AN AN OVERSIGHT THAT SERVER. ARE 65% OF RETAILERS HAVE DECIDED THE ANSWER TO THOSE RISKS IS ESTABLISHING- FOR EXPANDING THEIR DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING. WE'VE HEARD FROM WOMEN ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO MADE THE COUNTRY'S MASKS WERE LITTLE IS TWO CENTS APIECE WORKING SIXTY HOURS A WEEK DURING COVERT. SB SIXTY TWO IS THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL THERE WILL HELP. REGAIN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A WEEK AND WAGES STOLEN FROM THESE WORKING WOMEN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY.

HI EVERYONE THIS IS DAISY GONZALEZ WITH A GARMENT WORKER CENTER- I AM JUST GOING TO BE TRANSLATING BY THE END OF TESTIMONY NO PROBLEM. SHE SAID THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS MULLIN NOW WITH THE WINGS I HAVE BEEN WORKING FOURTEEN YEARS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. I'M A MEMBER OF THE GARMENT WORKER CENTER IN MY FOURTEEN YEARS OF THE GARMENT WORKER I'VE BEEN PAID CENTS FOR EACH PIECE A CELL BERMAN WORKERS ARE SKILLED WORKERS I OPERATE THE OVERLOCK MACHINE AND SINGLE NEEDLE MACHINE BUT THE MAJORITY OF US KNOW HOW TO USE. ANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL MACHINE. THREE A PANDEMIC CONTINUE WORKING. MANY OF US MASS THAT HOSPITAL GOWNS THEY EVEN DESIGNATED AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS BUT THE SALARIES DIDN'T CHANGE FOR MY ORK. I AM NOT PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR A WEEK OF WORK AND MAKE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY FOR A FULL WEEK OF WORK. ABOUT THE FIND A SECOND JOB TO SUPPORT MY TWO SONS. I PRODUCED FOR MULTI MILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES LIKE FOREVER TWENTY ONE BYE BYE YEAH AND ALITY. INDEED RENDON MILLION DOLLAR COMPANY BECAUSE THEY CREATE CONTRACTS. KNOWING THAT THE WORKERS WILL ONLY BE PAID A MERE CENTS FOR THEIR WORK. FOR THIS POINTS THAT THE END AND FOR US TO BE PAID A MINIMUM WAGE WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THE P. THREE AND CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE BRANCH FOR THE WAGE THAT BECAUSE- WE ASK YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS TO SUPPORT US AND PASSED SB SIXTY TWO. AT THIS LOT SB SIXTY TWO WAS PASSED. I'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY CHILDREN AND NOT HAVE TO TAKE THEM TO THE FACTORY WITH ME. AT THIS LAW PASSES IT WOULD HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON THE LIVES. OF GARMENT WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MATTHEW TO CARELESS. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN HONORABLE MEMBERS THAT'S I THINK IS THE NONPROFIT LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION THAT HAS REPRESENTED HUNDREDS OF GARMENT WORKERS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I'M THE STAFF ATTORNEY THAT CELTIC AND WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB SIXTY TWO. IN OUR WORK WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT NEEDS TO WE DESCRIBE SO POWERFULLY. AND THAT SENATOR ROSCOE REFERENCED AT THE GOAL BUSINESSES HAVE SEEN IT TOO WHICH IS WHY MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY GARMENT INDUSTRY BUSINESSES SUPPORT THIS BILL TO PROTECT WORKERS. ELIMINATE SWEATSHOPS AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS MAKE CLEAR ABUSE THE PIECE RATES ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE WIDESPREAD WAGE THEFT THAT PLAGUED THE INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE. THE PIECE RATE DESCRIBES HOW LOW THE PAY ISN'T MAKES IMPORTS IT MORE DIFFICULT BY COMPLICATING WAGE CALCULATIONS. THE P. THREE ALSO CAUSES HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS BECAUSE WORKERS MUST RACE TO COMPLETE AS MANY ITEMS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND THEY DO NOT GET PAID PER TIME THE SANITIZER WORKSTATIONS OR WASH THEIR HANDS. WHICH CREATES A PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT FOR THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS ESPECIALLY NOW. BY ELIMINATING THE PIECE RATE- SB SIXTY TWO STILL ALLOWS FOR BONUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE PAID FAIRLY. AS MIZZOU TO WE HAS REFERENCED THE UP CHAIN COMPANIES HAVE USED SUBCONTRACTING HOW THEIR CLOTHING MADE IN THE SOME AWFUL CONDITIONS AND CURRENTLY THEY ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THE BRANDS ARE INCENTIVIZED TO CONTRACT WITH THE LOWEST BIDDER MANY OF THEM ARE ONLY ABLE TO BID SO LOW BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PAYING THEIR WORKERS MINIMUM WAGE. BY HOLDING BRANDS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ROLE THEY PLAY IN PRODUCTION CHAIN WE WILL INCENTIVIZE THEM TO PAY FOR GOODS AT PRICES COMMENSURATE WITH WORKERS EARNING THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND BEYOND. AND THE LIMITING THE PATRIOT SYSTEM WILL PREVENT MANUFACTURE SOMETHING THE PIECE RATE SO LOW THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR WORKERS. TO MAKE THE MINIMUM WAGE. THE BILL ALSO EMPOWER THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S ZERO FIELD ENFORCEMENT. TO SITE OPTION COMPANIES IN WORKPLACE WIDE COMMON INVESTIGATIONS THIS IS A POWER THEY CURRENTLY LACK. OF WHICH ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THE TIME HAS COME TO FULLY REALIZE THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL GARMENTS BILL AB SIX THIRTY THREE FROM NINETEEN NINETY NINE TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE FOR THE GARMENT INDUSTRY HAS EVOLVED TO EXPLOIT. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT WE ASK THAT YOU JUST STATE YOUR NAME. AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL.

THANK YOU FOR NOW WE CAN MOVE ON OPPOSITION TO TESTIFY. IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE- ASHLEY HOFFMAN THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS ACTUALLY HW OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIFTY TWO IS A JOB KILLER. INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER GARMENT MANUFACTURERS ARE BRANDS THAT ARE VIOLATING THE LAW THE BILL SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT REGARDING JOINT LIABILITY AND ALLOW THOSE COMPANIES TO CONTINUE TO ACT UNLAWFULLY BY PASSING THE LIABILITY FOR WAGE CLAIMS THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE GARMENT WORKERS THEIR WAGES OR WORKING CONDITIONS. AND DID NOT CHOOSE THE CONTRACT WITH A COMPANY THAT VIOLATING THE LAW IT DOES THIS BY ESTABLISHING A NEW CATEGORY OF COMPANIES THAT ARE LIABLE FOR ALL OF THE GARMENT WORKERS WAGE CLAIMS CULT BRAND GUARANTORS. BRING YOUR IN TORRANCE BROADLY DEFINED AND INCLUDES ANY COMPANY THAT HAS INVOLVEMENT WHATSOEVER WITH LICENSING MAKING UP GARMENTS DYING AFFIXING A LABEL TO GARMENTS OR OTHERWISE ALTERING GARMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. PROPONENTS OF THE BILLS SEEK TO PUNISH BAD BRAND TO DO NOT TAKE CONTRACTORS ENOUGH MONEY FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FIRST ACTUALLY ALREADY ILLEGAL UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT TEN UNDER THAT LABOR CODE SECTION IT'S ILLEGAL TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WHERE YOU KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW. THAT THE CONTRACT IS INSUFFICIENT TO PAY WORKERS FOR THE MANUFACTURING. WORKER CAN ALREADY FEEL UNDER THAT LABOR CODE FOR DAMAGES. AND PENALTIES AND A TREE. SECOND THE ENDED CONSEQUENCES THE BREXIT THIS BILL IS THAT COULD GRANDPA END UP PAY FOR THAT. OF BREATH BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LIMITS. ON MY- BRING YOUR TOWARDS ARE LIABLE FOR EMPLOYEES AND HIGHER WAGE QUITE NOT MERELY FOR WAGES. FOR TIME SPENT ON GOVERNMENT. ISSUED ID WITH THE ENTITY. IF YOU HAD AN ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY THAT LICENSE OUT A LOGO. AND A LICENSOR THAT THEY USE CONTRACTS THAT PATRICK STATE WITH THAT LOGO. IF THEY CONTACT ME FACTURE. THE CONTRACT OF THE THIRD QUARTER AND PAY THAT FOR A HIGH PRICE. BUT I'VE BEEN INCIDENT THAT SEWER SUBSEQUENTLY TAKE LOW PAYING CONTRACT FROM THE FAST FASHION BRANDS AND FAILS TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE. CENTER CAME AND COMPANY THAT NARROWING THE LICENSOR IS NOW LIABLE FOR ALL OF THE WORKERS CLAIM. THE BILL ELIMINATES THE APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILITY THAT PRESENTLY EXISTS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY WILL BEGIN NEGOTIATING POINT IN EIGHTY SIX THIRTY THREE. THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPANSION OF GOING LIABILITIES THAT DOES NOT SURE WE'RE ACTUALLY HOLDING LIABLE BECAUSE THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PAID WORKERS. IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADDRESS THE NEED FOR MORE TARGETED ENFORCEMENT ARM INDUSTRY AND ELIMINATE THESE BAD ACTORS WHO OFTEN DO NOT REGISTER. B. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HERSELF DURING THE BUDGET PROVIDE HEARING THIS YEAR STATED THE WAY THAT TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE ABILITY TO PAY GOVERNMENT WORKER CLAIMS. IF THE INCREASE ENFORCEMENT SO VACANCIES AND EDUCATE WORKERS. DRIVING GOOD BRANDS OUT OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ANSWER. FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB SIX DETAIL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. BUT WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT- FOR ANYONE OPPOSED TO. ANYONE IN THE ROOM. AND AGAIN A. STATE NAME AFFILIATION POSITION ON THE BILL. OUR NOW IN THE ROOM MOVE ON.

SENATE DR RICE WANTED KNOWLEDGE OF REALLY APPRECIATE I KNOW YOU HAD A LOT LONG TIME HOW LONG HISTORY WORKING FOR THOSE- IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THAT WORKERS ESPECIALLY. APPRECIATED AND COMMENDED- AS I KNOW YOU REITERATED- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF ENDEMIC ISSUES WITH EMPLOYMENT VIOLATIONS SPECIFIC TO THIS INDUSTRY AND I KNOW THAT- THE BILL CONTINUES SOME OF THE WORK THAT WAS ENACTED FROM NINETEEN NINETY NINE- I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO SEEK TO REDUCE THE AND INFRACTIONS THAT ARE AVOIDING LIABILITY- THAT ARE KEEN TO EXPLOIT WORKERS- INDUCED WAGE THEFT- AND- FOR THOSE THAT ARE UNABLE TO. HELP OTHERS ARE UNABLE TO RECOVER SOME OF THEIR STOLEN WAGES- SO THANK YOU VERY REACHING SING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S GOING A LONG WAY TO HELP. THOSE THAT OFTEN DON'T HAVE A VOICE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE A VOICE FOR SO MANY UP HERE. AND I'M I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THANK YOU FOR. OFF HI MY- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT BACK I AM PROUD TO BE A JOIN AUTHOR WITH YOU ON THIS IS. US SO COMPELLING. AND THE OPPOSITION THAT WOULD SUGGEST SOMEHOW THIS IS TOO HARD FOR. COMPANIES TO- FIGURE OUT WHAT. THE COMPANIES ARE BUYING FROM WHETHER OR NOT. THEY'RE PAYING THEIR WORKERS I REMIND PEOPLE THAT AT LEAST. I KNOW WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE IT WAS A BIG DEAL THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY TRACE. BACK THE CLOTHING THAT WAS BOUGHT IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WASN'T BEING PURCHASED FROM SWEAT SHOP SO- I I'M SURE WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY IN THE UNITED STATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR. FOR THE RETAILERS TO. FIND OUT THE CONDITIONS UNDERWHICH- THOSE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ARE NOT BEING PAID OR ARE BEING PAID FOR THEIR LABOR. THANK YOU SOMERS ON SOLAR. I ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AS A PROP COAUTHOR AND ALSO- WHEN WE WHEN WE COME HERE WE THINK OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. THAT WILL HELP EVERYONE WE ALL ARE ASKED WOULD YOU COME TO SACRAMENTO TO DO. THIS LAWS WHY I'M HERE MY MOTHER WORKED IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY FOR TWO DECADES. SHE WORKED AT HOOVER IN WASHINGTON JODY TO TAKE. DATE UP AND- MY MOTHER IS EIGHTY FOUR YEARS OLD HAS A MYRIAD OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS THEY LEFT WITH NO RETIREMENT. NO MEDICAL IN A SMALL SEVERANCE PAY. AND I REMEMBER VISITING MY MOTHER. ALL THE YEARS OF MY LIFE EVEN IN COLLEGE- I REMEMBER WHEN THE WORKERS MOSTLY LATINOS. THEY GOT A SWAP AND- EMIR A BUT IT DIED AND GONE HAVE. BECAUSE THE SWELTERING HEAT IN A PLACE WAS SO BAD. I REMEMBER THE LONG HOURS THE LAW THE LOW PAY. SO I HAVE SEEN THE IMPACTS OF THESE INJUSTICES AND EXPLOITIVE PRACTICES HAPPEN GARMENT WORKERS AT THE HANDS OF THIS INDUSTRY. I CITIES WRONGDOINGS HAPPENING MY DISTRICT OF SOUTH LA WHERE HUNDREDS OF WORKERS PRIMARILY IMMIGRANT WOMEN. OUR SPENDING COUNTLESS HOURS MAKING CLOTHING OR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ONLY TO BE PAID CENTS FOR EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AS LITTLE AS FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THESE COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE LOOPHOLES IN STATE LAW TO MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFITS AND NOT PAY THEIR WORKERS WITH THEIR BOAT. MY MOTHER A LOT OF WAYS. WAS TO GO BETWEEN IN SOME WAYS SHE WAS A UNION LEADER. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GO TO WEDDINGS. TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILY. AND THE LABOR COMMISSIONER NEVER REALLY CAMERA. AND SO THIS LAW STRENGTH INTO TO ENSURE THAT WE DO OUR JOBS IN THE GOVERNMENT. AS FAR AS THE GARMENT- I REMEMBER I WENT TO USC AND I WOULD SEE THESE CLOTHING THE SAME CLOTHING THAT MY MOTHER MADE FROM SHANKLAND AT THESE IMMIGRANT WOMEN MADE BY AT THE FRATERNITY HOUSES AT USC ALL ROUND CAPTAIN SYSTEM PARTIES AND THEY WOULD GO TO I MAGNUM'S PROBABLY WOULD ONLY TO THE NETWORK BULLOCKS AND BY MAGNUM- AT THAT TIME WITH THE NEWMARKET OF. OF THE TIME THEY WERE SPENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR DRESSES. THAT MY MOTHER MADE. TENCENT'S FINTECH FIVE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. AND WHEN THEY COULDN'T SELL THEM THEY WOULD HAVE A PARKING LOT. AND I WOULD TELL THE AFTER AMERICAN LATINOS THAT MATIBA CD COME TO PARKING LOTS OF THE SAME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR DRESSES THEY COULD GET FOR TEN DOLLARS. FIFTEEN DOLLARS. SO PERSONALLY I'VE NEVER BOUGHT ANYTHING. AT COST. BECAUSE I KNOW THE COST OF WHAT IT TAKES. BUT I ALSO KNOW HOUSE OVERPRICED AND HOW. THESE BRANDS ARE MAKING MONEY. OFF THE SWEAT OF PEOPLE. ON SHE HUGE RETAIL AND PROFITS AND SO- I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE- I GET TO SHOW MY MOTHER WHY SHE RAISED ME. I GET TO SHOW MY MOTHER WHY I'M HERE. THAT I GET TO PROVE TO HER THAT SHE DID THE RIGHT THING SHE RAISED ME. AND THAT THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS BILL AND WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH IT CHAU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUMMARY JONES SAWYER- AND THAT THE POWERFUL CONNECTION AND THIS IS A MULTI GENERATIONAL FIGHT. THAT IN- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. CRITICISM OF THE JOINT LIABILITY WITH A LOOK AT THE END OF THE DAY THESE COMPANIES KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING THEY'RE PROFITING WILDLY FROM WHAT THEY HAVE FOR DECADES- AND THEY CAN'T STICK THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND AND CONTINUE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE THESE WORKERS- AND- I APPRECIATE YOUR- PERSISTENCE. AND ON THIS PIECE LEGISLATION- YOU KNOW WE ARE WE ARE SEEING SECOND THIRD FOURTH GENERATION WORKERS- YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS FAMILIES HAVE BEEN- IT'S- AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF- YOU KNOW OVER MANY DECADES. BUT WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP- CENTER THAT ALSO AND I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL AUTHOR AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM. OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE WE'RE ALL WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THIS LAST GENERATION. THE SUFFERS THIS KIND OF INJUSTICE. AND SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY CLOSING. COMMENTS I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR HEARTFELT- REMARKS IN SUPPORT- URGE AND I VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE CALL ON SB SIXTY TWO PLEASE. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE KALRA BY THE KALRA FLOOR. GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ SIDE JONES SAWYER FOR MY MOTHER BY JUNE MILLER I'D RADIUS SIERRA. WARD BY WARD I. RIGHT THE BILL'S OUT COLLEGES THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU MEMBERS. I REMEMBER TO THIS BEFORE TEN SANDRA LEYVA. SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIZEABLE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SENATE BILL FOR TEN INSURERS THAT WORKER SAFETY IS NEVER DELAYED OR SATISFIED AS A RESULT OF DUPLICATIVE EXPENSIVE AND UNNECESSARY ANALYSIS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED INTO LAW SB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO PREPARE AN IN DEPTH ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF ANY REGULATION WITH AN ESTIMATED FISH FINANCIAL IMPACT OF OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IS CALLED THE STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT ALSO KNOWN AS THE SHARIA WHEN IT COMES TO WORKER SAFETY AND HEALTH REFORMS WERE ALREADY AWARE OF THE EXTENSIVE PROCESS THAT EXIST BEFORE A RULE CAN BE FINALIZED THOSE STEPS INCLUDE. A BILL SIGNED INTO LAW DIRECTING THE CALIFORNIA OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS FOR TO TAKE ACTION ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE TO MULTIPLE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS THREE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT WITH WHICH WILL FURTHER ASSESS THE FISCAL IMPACT FOR THE O. S. H. S. B. THAT EXTENSIVELY REVIEWS THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ANY STANDARD BY THIS POINT AT LEAST FOR THOROUGH FISCAL ANALYSIS WILL HAVE OCCURRED FOR THE RULE MAKING PROCESS TO BE COMPLETED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE THREE OF REVIEW MANDATES A FIFTH FISCAL ANALYSIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS ALREADY VERY THOROUGH PROCESS THE THREE I CAN EXTEND THE RULE MAKING PROCESS BY ONE TO TWO YEARS OR MORE AND IN TURN CONTINUED CONTINUE TO ENDANGER THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS IN THE WORKPLACE A FURTHER DELAY IN ADOPTING SAFETY STANDARDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECOMMENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR AND ALREADY GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE LEVELS OF ADMINISTRATIVE FISCAL REVIEW MAY PLACE WORKERS AT AN INCREASED RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH. PROPOSAL STUDENTS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE THE STREET SUCH AS INDOOR HEAT STANDARD PROPOSED REQUIRED BY SB ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN HAS SUFFERED SEVERE DELAYS AS A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS FIVE YEARS TO BE EXACT. THE LANGUAGE FOR INDOOR HEAT STANDARD HAS YET TO EVEN DEEPER. TO THE O. S. H. S. B. DESPITE LET'S LEGISLATION REQUIRING THAT THIS HAPPENED MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO. THIS IS TO ADDITIONAL YEARS THUS FAR THE INDOOR WORKERS HAVE LABORED IN GRUELING HEAT WITH NO CLEAR HE PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. WELL THE PANDEMIC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE DELAY THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF IT. ALSO IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WERE APPROVED IN SIX TO SEVEN MONTHS ONE PROTECTING WORKERS FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE AND ANOTHER FROM COVERED NINETEEN. AS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THESE DID NOT REQUIRE THE SHARIA BUT THE REGULATION STILL RECEIVED A THOROUGH VETTING WITH PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGENCY ANALYSIS AND STAKEHOLDER PHILIP FEEDBACK. THESE AND OTHER EXPERIENCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT SHRIYA BRINGS LITTLE TO THE WORKER SAFETY RULE MAKING PROCESS. OTHER THAN GREATER DELAYS AS SUCH AS BEFORE TEN EXEMPTS WORKER SAFETY RULE MAKING FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM S. RIA I'M PROPOSED MAJOR ROLE MAKING. THIS EXAMPLE REGULATIONS THIS EXEMPTION ALREADY EXISTS FOR SEVERAL AGENCIES CONSIDER INCLUDING THE FEC AND UC HASTINGS. ALL OTHER EXISTING LAYERS OF REVIEW INCLUDING INTERNAL FOR FISCAL ANALYSIS THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE PROCESS THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS BOARD'S PUBLIC HEARINGS AND MEETINGS. AND THE STANDARD OF RULE MAKING PROCESS REMAIN IN PLACE THIS BILL REFLECTS THE EXCEPTIONALLY DETAILED FISCAL ANALYSIS. ALREADY CURSED AT CAL OSHA AND ALLOWS THE AGENCY TO FOCUS SCARCE RESOURCES AND MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL WILL HELP PROTECT WORKERS SAFETY AND HEALTH ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS MITCH STEIGER. OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THE YOU SIR LEYVA- MY STAGGER WHENEVER READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT AT HEART IT'S REALLY ABOUT MAKING GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER ALLOWING THIS ONE PROCESS TO WORK FASTER AT LESS COST WHILE IN THE WITH LIMITING THE ABILITY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO WEIGH IN ON THE PROCESS. AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKERS SAFETY ALLOWING THE STANDARDS TO GET IN PLACE FASTER MEANS PREVENTING INJURIES AND ILLNESSES AND SAVING LIVES SUTTER LEYVA REFERENCE EXAMPLE OF THE INDOOR HEAT WHICH IS REALLY A PERFECT. ONE TO GET A WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. OFFICE OF SETTING UP THE CENTER HAS INVOLVED MULTIPLE ADVISORY COMMITTEES AND SO THESE ARE. VERY LARGE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC OPEN THE STAKEHOLDERS WHOEVER WANTS TO SHOW UP AND CALM AND THERE NO LIMITS ON TESTIMONY PEOPLE CAN SPEAK FOR. AS LONG AS THEY WANT GET INTO AS MUCH DETAIL AS THEY LIKE ON. ANY OF THE TOPICS RELATED TO THE ISSUE IN HERE THE ECONOMIC DETAILS WERE VERY RELEVANT NEVER BROUGHT UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE GOT INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT WHAT EMPLOYERS BELIEVED TO BE AT THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE- AND SO WE HAD THESE ALL OVER THE STATE. AND THEN AFTER ALL THOSE HAD CONCLUDED THERE WERE EIGHT DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF LANGUAGE THAT WERE PRESENTED WITH WEEKS TO COMMENTS ON EACH ONE. AND THE LANGUAGE OF EVENTUALLY COMPLETED IN APRIL OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND AS WAS MENTIONED IT WAS OVER TWO YEARS AGO AND SENSE WORKERS HAVE JUST BEEN. SITTING AND WAITING AND SUFFERING THROUGH THIS HAZARD WITHOUT A STANDARD BUT THE PROBLEM HAS CONTINUED. WE LOOKED INTO THE RECORDS AND FOUND THAT SINCE JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST SIXTY DIFFERENT INDOOR HEAT SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS FILED WITH QALISYA. EVEN WITHOUT A STANDARD TO ENFORCE BUT WORKERS THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS STILL SO BAD. THEY STILL CALL CALIFORNIA TO SEE WHAT COULD B DONE AND THE PROBLEM IS JUST GOING TO KEEP CONTINUING UNTIL WE DO SOMETHING. AND WILL SOON BECAUSE THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT SERIOUS ARE USELESS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO WEIGH IN ON THEIR VALUE FOR OTHER AGENCIES WE AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF WORKER SAFETY. THEY ARE INTERESTING AND THEY ARE HELPFUL BUT- WHATEVER THEIR VALUE IS WE BELIEVE IT'S IMMEASURABLY LESS THAN THE VALUE OF A WORKER'S LIFE. AND THAT'S REALLY THE DECISION THAT WE'RE MAKING HERE BY ALLOWING THE SYSTEM TO CONTINUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS DELAY OF ONE TO TWO YEARS LETTING WORKERS GET HURT. LETTING SOME WORKERS DIED DEPENDING ON THE HAZARD WHILE WE WAIT THIS DOCUMENT TO BE WAIT FOR THE DOCUMENT TO BE COMPLETED. AND WHATEVER THE VALUE IS IT'SJUST NOT AS MUCH AS KEEPING WORKERS ALIVE. WE DO THINK THERE IS PRECEDENT GIVEN THAT OTHER AGENCY PROCESSES ARE EXEMPT FROM THIS REQUIREMENT I THINK IT MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE HERE AND WE STRONGLY URGE. YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR. IN A TOUGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALTHOUGH NOTHING PUBLICLY- YES STATE NAME AFFILIATE POSITION THE BILL. AND IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM.

MEANT HE NOW THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE BY THE LEGISLATION BY- CALDERON IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HEARD A THRESHOLD THE HIGH THRESHOLD OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IT'S TRIGGERED VERY FEW REGULATION. OF THE WHOLE STATE EVERY DONATION PASSED REPUGNANT. ABOUT TEN REGULATIONS THE YEAR- CALL. TO WHAT THE OF. I AYE WE SAY THAT THE CONTENTS THE THREE OUT THAT ARE NOT DUPLICATE IT AND THERE NOT CAP OTHER NOW. TO THE CONTRARY TO RENT HOUSES IN THOROUGH. AND CAN MUCH MORE HELPFUL INFORMATION FOR THE POLICY MAKERS TO VOTE ON THESE REGULATIONS. AS WELL AS FOR THE COMMUNITY. ONE EXAMPLE- ONE PIECE THAT I CANNOT DOUBT THAT THAT WOULD REMAIN WOULD BE D. I. AFTER ECONOMIC IMPACT STATEMENT- THIS IS A FIVE PAGE FILL IN THE BLANK FORM. THAT I HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED ALONG WITH REGULATIONS. IN CONTRAST SHARIA WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING MORE LIKE. SIXTY TO EIGHTY PAGES. OF THAT KIND OF AN OUT THAT YOU WOULD KEEP A PUBLIC POLICY GRADUATE PROGRAM- WITH THE FACT HOW MUCH HOW MANY YEARS WILL IT AFFECT THEM. WELL THE COST OF COMPLIANCE GO DOWN IS IT A ONE YEAR PROBLEM OR GET THE ACCELERATING COSTS WERE IN TWENTY YEARS THE COST BLESSED TO BE ON THE TENABLE. THOSE ARE QUESTIONS THAT ARE CONTAINED ELSEWHERE- CHU AND I'D LIKE THE FLAG ONE POINT IT WAS NOT MENTIONED THIS COMMITTED NOW. BUT WHAT MENTIONED IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE NOW THAT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OVERSEAS. AND CHECK STEPS TO HEY LISTEN YOU'VE GOT MISCALCULATIONS RAW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS WRONG. PLEASE TRESPASS. THAT'S NOT CONTAINED OTHER PLACES YOU'RE LOSING A PIECE THAT. OVERSIGHT THERE- AND DECLINE THAT IT CONTAINED ELSEWHERE I THINK IT IS REALLY. INACCURATE TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE PROFITS- AS YOU AGE YOU CAN BUT ON. STOP ALL THE IT CAN. WITHOUT THAT DOES. BUT I THINK IT'S A BACK TO THE QUESTION. IS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT KIND OF QUALITY KNOWLEDGE IT IS WORTH HAVING- I'D LIKE TO FIVE ONE THE OTHER SPECIFIC THAT THERE WAS A QUESTION OF THE EMERGENCY REGULATION. NOTABLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE WORKERS HEALTH IS BEING YEAH YOU KNOW JUST THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY A WILDFIRE SMOKING WITH CO THAT. THE BOARD I THINK IT NOTED BUT SENATOR AND MR STEIGER CAN SKIP ST PROCESSES VIA AN EMERGENCY REGULATION THAT CAN BE DONE. FOR TALKING ABOUT HERE IS FOR THE DAY TO DAY BUSINESS WITH THE MAIN. REGULATIONS THAT YOU'RE NOT RUSHED. DO WE GET THE ACT L. AND I THINK THAT THE SOME WHERE WELL IT'S PROPERTY GIVEN EMERGENCY SETTING. NOT PROPERTY DUE TO THE MAINSTAY OF THE WORK- ONE OTHER POINT WHICH THEN CORRECT NOW CLOSED AND APPRECIATE THE TIME- THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT HELLO TO ALREADY DOES THOROUGH ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WHICH IS OUT THERE. I HAVEN'T WORKED IN CALIFORNIA FOR CALCHAMBER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ECONOMIC OUT THERE IS BEING BIRD TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE PROCESS IT'S NOT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THE TAX IS NOT FINALIZED YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO REVIEW IT- A MONTH UNLESS IT'S NOT TIME TO DO ECONOMIC IN OUT THAT FIRST STATEWIDE. REGULATION THAT CHANGES THINGS. SO THAT IS NOT COMPARABLE TO SYRIA NOR AT THE EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE ANYTHING BEING DONE I WENT TO YOU SEE A THING. IT'S A VERY SMALL SCHOOL TO PAY THAT YOU THE EIGHTH IN THE BAM FROM THIS PROCESS AND THAT WE SHOULD BAN ALL CALLOW TO WRECK THE IT'S JUST AN INCOMPARABLE ANALOGY- BUT- I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF COURSE WITH SPEED AND I DO WISH THAT THE ANARCHY REGULATION HAD MOVED MORE QUICKLY- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

THANK YOU SO MUCH WILL WANT TO SEE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AS WELL RESEARCHER ALONG WITH YOUR STAFF- FOR YOUR AS SINCERE ENGAGEMENT IN THE BILL AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL CALIFORNIA PAYER SO SHIPPED TO THE FRESH MARKET COME FROM BEAUTIFUL COUNTY OF LAKE AT THAT'S LOCATED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NOW FOR GENERATIONS IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A UNIQUE SITUATION IN LAKE COUNTY. RESIDENTS HAVE WORKED A PAIR HARVEST TO ENSURE THAT THOSE SWEET AND JUICY DELICACIES CAN BE DELIVERED TO STORE SHELVES AROUND AMERICA AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD NOW IT'S A BIT OF A UNIQUE SITUATION IN LAKE COUNTY- BE PACKING SEASON IS EXTREMELY SHORT. AND IT. LASTS ONLY FOUR TO SEVEN WEEKS. AND IT HAVE AR AUG OF A YEAR- SO AT ITS PEAK AT IT COMPETES WITH OTHER TOP INDUSTRIES WITHIN. THE COUNTY WHICH IS TOURISM I IN PARTICULAR SO THAT MEANS LABOR IS EXTREMELY SHORT IN DUE TO THOSE LABOR SHORTAGES. SB SIX THIRTY FIVE EXTENSIVE STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO BE TO WORK OVERTIME WITH PACKING PEARS IN AUGUST. WHEN SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION. TO ALLEVIATE THE SUMMER JOBS SHORTAGE. NOW ALL WORK PERMITS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. THEY ARE SUPERVISED AND MANAGED THROUGH THE LAKE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS WHO WILL BE WITH US HERE TODAY. AND MISTER FALKENBERG SUPPORTS THE PROGRAM. AT THE PROGRAM IS THEN OVERSEEN AT THE SECOND LAYER- ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL BY THE OFFICE OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. NOW THE RECENT REPORTS THAT CAME FROM- THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WE ARE IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE- IT SHOWS THAT THERE ARE BEEN ABSOLUTELY ZERO VIOLATIONS. ZERO VIOLATIONS- WITH THE LAKE COUNTY PROGRAM SINCE THE LAST TIME WE WERE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT THESE PERMITS CANNOT BE ISSUED THEY CAN'T BE ISSUED DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR WHICH MEANS STUDENTS CANNOT WORK WHEN SCHOOL IS IN SESSION. ONLY DURING THOSE AT STRICT SIX TO SEVEN WEEKS DURING HARVEST. NOW THIS ORIGINAL BILL PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX EVERY EXTENSION SINCE HAS RECEIVED BROAD SUPPORT. ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS NOW THIS WOULD EXTEND THE SUNSET FROM JANUARY TWENTY TWO- EXCUSE ME UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY THIRTY TWO. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE AS IT DID LAST TIME THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER FILED A NEW REPORT BY TWENTY THIRTY. THAT'S THE REPORT THAT WAS JUST REFERENCING- AND THEN ALSO MAINTAIN ALL THIS THE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYERS WHO USED TO LIVE. IN MISTER CHAIR INTO THE COMMITTEE I HAVE TO DATE SUPERINTENDENT OF LAKE COUNTY SCHOOLS. BROCK FALKENBERG WITH US IS A WELLESLEY BROWN UP WITH THE CALIFORNIA FRESH ASSOCIATION CHAIR THANK YOU CAN FOR BE TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SO. FOR FALKENBERG LOUIS BROWN- WHERE IS READY TO GO- MISTER FALKENBERG IF YOU'RE THERE YOU MAY GO AHEAD AND TO MAKE UP TO TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE.

FIFTY WILL EXTEND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MINORS AGES SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. TO GAIN MEANINGFUL TEMPORARY SUMMER TIME EMPLOYMENT. BY SUMMERTIME I WOULD MEAN. SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION NOT THAT IT'S A CALENDAR DECEMBER TIME BUT THE SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION. THEY COUNTY OF TRADITION SUFFERED THE CON THAT LACK BEHIND THE REST OF CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT IT IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR TEENS TO WORK. IN ORDER TO HAVE SPENDING MONEY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND CLOTHING. THIS BILL SIMPLY EXTENDS IN NARAL LAW THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR MANY YEARS ALLOWING LAKE COUNTY MINERS TO CONTINUE AN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. THAT THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY BENEFITED FROM. AS NOTED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. ACTIS REQUIRED THE ANNUAL APPROVAL OF THE LAKE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HEALTHY WE STAFF MEETING WITH PACKING SHED MANAGERS TO REVIEW PRACTICES PROCEDURES AND EXPECTATIONS PRIOR TO GRANTING THAT ANNUAL APPROVAL. ADDITIONALLY THE COUNTY OFFICE OVERSEES ALL WORK PERMITS FOR THE MINORS INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE MINERS IS A DRASTIC. PROGRAM BENEFITS THE YOUTH INVOLVED SB SIXTY FIVE WILL PROVIDE LASTING BENEFITS TO THE TEAMS AND WORKING FAMILIES OF LAKE COUNTY SUCH AS FOSTERING LIFELONG LEARNING. DEVELOPING A STRONG WORK ETHIC AND STRESS IN THE COMPLETION OF THEIR EDUCATION. MOST IMPORTANTLY IT ADDRESSES THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE MINORS INVOLVED I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON IT SB SIX EIGHTY FIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M NEXT WILL HAVE LOUIS BROWN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BILLY BROWN CALLING TODAY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FRESH FRUIT ASSOCIATION AND SPECIFICALLY ON BEHALF OF OUR PACKING SHED MANAGERS AND COMPANIES LOCATED IN LAKE COUNTY HI THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TRADITION IN LAKE COUNTY- THAT HAS BEEN A STRONG PARTNERSHIP- WITH THE PAIR INDUSTRY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- WE TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY.

SB SIX THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IF YOU WERE IN OPPOSITION OF SB SIX EIGHTY FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RED. I'M I'M SORRY SENATOR AND YOU KNOW THAT I FIVE YEARS AGO I OPPOSE THIS BILL AS WELL I THINK IT'S QUITE HONESTLY SHAMEFUL THAT ORGANIZED LABOR IS NOT- JUST ON PRINCIPLE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT. WAS SAID IN THE PRESENTATION I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WITHOUT THIS BILL SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS COULD STILL WORK FORTY HOURS A WEEK. EIGHT FIVE SIX. EIGHT HOUR DAYS AND TO SUGGEST THAT THIS TEACHES KIDS WORK ETHIC BECAUSE WE ARE- ALLOWING THEM TO WORK SIXTY HOURS IN A WEEK IS- DISTURBING TO ME PERSONALLY IT I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION I'VE TALKED TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE ABOUT THE PAIR SEASON HOW SHORT IT IS. WHAT HAPPENS TO JUST FIT INTO THE SUMMER MONTHS- AND HOW THIS PROGRAM IS UNIQUE AND PART OF THE TRADITION OF LAKE COUNTY WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND EMPLOYMENT. BUT I THINK FOR ME PERSONALLY- I THINK THAT THE ONLY WAY WE- HONOR. OUR OUR CHILD LABOR LAWS IN THE WHICH WERE HARD FOUGHT- PEOPLE LITERALLY DIED FOR THEM IS WE DON'T ALLOW THESE KINDS OF EXCEPTIONS AND SO- I HAVE TO VOTE NO I WILL CONTINUE VOTE NO I'M I'M- IT'S IN NO WAY PERSONAL. I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THOUGH THAT MAYBE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO LAKE COUNTY AND THE NEED BUT TO SUGGEST. THAT CHILDREN NEED TO WORK SIXTY HOURS A WEEK TO TEACH THEM WORK ETHIC OR TO GIVE THEM SOME OPPORTUNITY. I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF I CAN FOLLOW THAT THROUGH AN OPPORTUNITY TO FILL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS IN OTHER WORDS ARE YOU SAYING SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP IN A PACKING HOUSE I MEAN. IT'S A I I'M NOT I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT ARGUMENT AT LEAST LET'S BE HONEST IT IS S. AS AN EMPLOYMENT NEED FOR LAKE COUNTY FOR THE- ACTORS BUT- I DON'T. PERSONALLY THINK THERE'S ANY- REASON. WHY WE SHOULD BE AWARDING ANYONE. AN EXEMPTION WHEN IT COMES TO CHILD LABOR LAWS AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR UNDER CURRENT LAW FORTY EIGHT HOURS THEY COULD WORK THEY WOULDN'T NEED THIS EXEMPTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIXTY HOUR WEEKS DURING THE SUMMERTIME FOR KIDS WHO ARE SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD SO. I'M FOR THAT REASON I HAVE TO BUT NO CAM I THINK. THANK YOU A SERVICE. I WAS NOT. PRIVY TO THE PRIOR- HEARINGS. BUT LISTENING TO THE SUPERINTENDENT TALK ABOUT. THIS PROVIDING THE STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW STRONG WORK ETHIC TALKING ABOUT CONTINUING AN IMPORTANT TRADITION. I WAS A FARM WORKER MYSELF WITH PICKED ONIONS AND GRAPES AND TEN HOURS A DAY I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE DOING THAT BUT. TO HELP THE SUPERINTENDENT TO SAY. THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD AND I SEE THAT IT ALSO IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THAT. THEY WILL TEACH THESE YOUNG. CHILDREN TO LEARN THE DESIRE TO DO BETTER TO BETTER THEMSELVES THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION VOCATIONAL TRADES. I ABSOLUTELY DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION AND TO SHOW REAL WORK EXPERIENCE ON A RESUME FORTY EIGHT HOURS A WEEK WILL SHOW THAT WORK EXPERIENCE ON A RESUME. AND A SOURCE FOR POSITIVE LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION- RIGHT. IT SADDENS ME TO HEAR THE SUPERINTENDENT GIVE HIS HIS TESTIMONY I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE LEADER OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WOULD COME BEFORE US AND SAY THIS IS A GREAT THING. BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MEXICAN KIDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE BEEN RAISED WORKING IN THE FIELDS AND I JUST SEE THIS AS- BASICALLY SAYING THIS IS ALL YOU CAN GET. AND LET'S GET TO DOING MORE FOR US. I ABSOLUTELY. CANNOT AND WOULD NOT SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT THAT. IT AND I'M SORRY THAT THE AT AT THE AUG THIS IS ACTUALLY NOTHING- PERSONAL SENATOR- I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO BUT- THIS IS JUST LISTENING TO THIS WAS VERY DIFFICULT QUITE FRANKLY. READING THE ANALYSIS IS DIFFICULT BUT LISTENING TO THE SUPERINTENDENT. SUPPORT AND% ENDORSE AND TRY TO SHOW WAS THE GREATNESS OF. SUCH A SUCH A BIG THE EXEMPTION ALLOWING THESE CHILDREN TO WORK. TEN HOURS A DAY IN UP TO SIXTY HOURS A WEEK. I IT IS HARD FOR ME TO ACCEPT- THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR WORK. THANK YOU I'M SORRY REQUIRE I JUST HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR THIS- MAYBE IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS PROGRAM NO THIS HAS BEEN AN EXISTING EXEMPTION FOR SOME TIME- ARE THE- YOUTH WHO ARE SIX YEARS SEVEN YEARS OLD- AND AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THIS OPPORTUNITY- ARE THE REQUIRED TO BE WORKING UP TO THE SIXTY HOURS ON THE CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT SO ARE THEIR EMPLOYERS WHO ARE EXERCISING THIS EXEMPTION- WHO ARE SAYING THAT IF THEY WANT TO WORK AT- WHAT COMPANY ACCENT FARM. AND FARM TAX- THAT THEY MUST WORK FIFTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK OR IF THE JOB WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THEM AT ALL YEAH WE TALKED OKAY- IT WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING A LITTLE MORE COMFORT IF THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS- ALSO- CLARIFIED MAYBE IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT- A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT YOU KNOW SHALL NOT REQUIRE- AN INDIVIDUAL TO WORK MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS A WEEK- AND SECONDLY I JUST WANT ALSO FOR CLARIFICATION OR THE RECEIVING TIME AND A HALF- FOR HOURS WORKED MORE THAN FORTY HOURS A WEEK. SENATE BRINGING AND YOU TO GET BACK ITS OVER TO BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S OVER DOUBLE OVERTIME OKAY YEAH OVERTIME LAWS ARE OKAY. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TIME AND A HALF I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL RATE IS IT BUT SELL OKAY IT IS OVERTIME. OKAY COULD I WON JUST ONE EXTRA THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE MISSED HERE TO THROUGH THIS SITE EXEMPTION. OF COURSE THAT'S PART OF HIS LAN AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW NOT. NOT WITHSTANDING MAYBE SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WHICH I AM I AM IS TAKING ANOTHER CALL IN AND OUT HERE AND MISS THAT. THAT WHICH WOULD BRING ME CONCERN AS WELL- I DO SEE THIS AS- YOU KNOW AND IT'S OPPORTUNITY FOR SPECIFIC COUNTY FOR SPECIFIC- INDUSTRY HERE I'M I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS GOING FORWARD AND IF YOU COULD- POSSIBLY WORK ON- YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE CLARIFICATIONS AT A FUTURE. TIME POINT IN THE ASSEMBLY I THINK THAT WOULD BRING SOME COMFORT. ABSOLUTELY SIR- SO LOOK I APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS- WE'D BE MORE THAN WILLING TO BE ABLE TO. COMMIT TO AMENDED IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE FURTHER TODAY. CLARIFIED THAT IT WOULD BE VOLUNTARY BECAUSE THAT'S THE INTENT BY THE WAY SO HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO- SEPTEMBER GONZALEZ IS ABSOLUTELY REYES ACTUALLY RIGHT. AT THIS IS A VERY SPECIFIC. FOCUS BASED OFF OF LABOR SHORTAGES. AND I. WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT- AND IT'S OPTIONAL TO BE ABLE TO WORK THAT- ADDITIONAL THOSE ADDITIONAL HOURS- AND UNDERSTAND WHERE- THIS GONZALEZ AS WELL AS MAJORITY LEADER. HAVE JUST MENTIONED- IN REGARDS TO THE WORDS THAT WERE USING WORDS MATTER COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT- AND ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT I USE SURE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU IS THAT. HI THIS IS SOMETHINGTHAT WILL WORK WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU ON- IF THIS BILL WERE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD- BECAUSE IT REALLY IS. SIGNATURE ISSUE FOR SPECIFIC. PROJECTS TO. AVOID BEYOND. CUT WITH THE REQUIRED REPORT WAS REQUIRED FOR YEARS AGO. I THERE HAVE BEEN AFTER ZERO OUT BY IT IS SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR ABOUT THAT REPORT THERE ARE JUST A COUPLE THINGS THAT THAT ARE CONCERNING TO ME- ONE THIS KEEPS ME IN PATCHES A LAKE COUNTY PROGRAM BUT IN FACT THAT REPORT. STATES SOMEHOW THAT IT WAS ALSO USED IN FRESNO COUNTY SO. HEY I SAW THAT AS WELL AND THERE WAS A VIOLATION FRESNO COUNTY AND I'LL BE HONEST TO YOU- SOME NUMBER I DON'T KNOW CITIES MENTIONED IS NOT JUST FOR LIKE COUNTY IF THEY'RE BEING GRANTED IN FRESNO COUNTY AS WELL. THIS BILL IS JUST REALLY COUNTY. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHY AND FRESNO COUNTY WELL I IF I WERE. I DON'T AN ATTORNEY I MIGHT LOOK INTO YOU KNOW THE VIOLATION CHILD LABOR LAWS AND IN FRESNO COUNTY- I ASSURE YOU THIS BILL BEFORE YOU IS SIMPLY FOCUS ON MY COUNTY SO THE REPORT- CLEARLY STATE SO THAT THIS WAS ALSO HAPPENING FRESNO COUNTY. SO WE KNOW THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN FRESNO COUNTY AND THE SOME MEMBERS HAVE TO THE CREE OTHER THING THAT BOTHERS ME ON THE REPORT IS THAT. THE INSPECTION IF YOU WILL OR THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE FOR TWENTY TWENTY WAS DONE BY A PHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE MANAGER. AND SO GIVEN WHAT WE SAW IN A LOT OF PACKING HOUSES AND DIFFERENT THINGS DURING THE PANDEMIC- I THINK IT'S- DISGRACEFUL THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER- SIMPLY CALLED MANAGERS AND ASKED WITH EVERYTHING OKAY IN TWENTY TWENTY. TO PROVIDE US WITH A REPORT TODAY THAT WE'RE BASING. NOW NOT ANOTHER FIVE YEARS BUT TEN YEARS ON- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT'S NOT QUITE AN INSPECTION IT'S NOT CLEAR AN INSPECTION WAS EVER DONE WHEN THERE WERE WORKERS THERE- AND SO IF WE'RE RELYING SIMPLY ON- DATA FROM THE EMPLOYER. AT NO. I AM NOT SUGGESTING THESE MAY BE REALLY I REALLY I HATE TO DO THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THESE EMPLOYERS I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING WE HAVE NO REASON. TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE BUT- GIVEN- HOW WE USUALLY DO REPORTS PERHAPS PERHAPS THIS IS MORE OF A- AND I THINK ACTUALLY I COULD BE WRONG BUT I MIGHT HAVE REQUIRED THE REPORT FIVE YEARS AGO IN APPROPRIATIONS- AND PERHAPS THE REPORT SHOULD BE BEING DONE BY OSHA AS WELL AS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER BECAUSE LIKE KERN. COMMISSIONER DOESN'T NORMALLY DO THESE REPORTS ALSO IF THIS IS SO TIED INTO THE COUNTY- EDUCATION OFFICE IT BE INTERESTING OR IT WOULD IT WOULD BE- THAT WOULD HELP US. GUIDE THESE TYPES OF EXEMPTIONS TO NOTE THE STUDENTS- YOU KNOW DID THE STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL IS THIS EXEMPTION I AM OBVIOUSLY THAT. THE SUPERINTENDENT IN THE COUNTY- SUPPORTS IN AND PUSHES THIS AT BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF STUDENTS BECAUSE IT'S NOT SIMPLY LIKE. WAS THERE ONE INJURY REPORTED YES WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THIS GOES ARE CHILD LABOR LAWS GO WALK BE BEYOND HEALTH AND SAFETY RIGHT THERE THERE THE REASON WE HAVE THEM IS BECAUSE CHILDREN SHOULD BE CHILDREN. I'M NOT BE IT AND- NOT BECAUSE THEY WILLINGLY IF YOU WILL WE ALSO THOSE OF US I THINK THAT COME FROM THESE BACKGROUNDS UNDERSTAND MORE THAT THAT- WILLINGLY IS BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY THEBILLS NOT A CHILL CHILD WANTS TO SPEND TEN. HOURS A DAY ALL SUMMER LONG IN A PACKING HOUSE- SO I JUST I THINK DOES THIS GO TO APPROPRIATE I BELIEVE THIS DOES GET ABOUT APPROPRIATIONS SO MAYBE WE CAN TALK THROUGH SOME OF THAT IN THERE BUT I WANT YOU TO AT LEAST KNOW HOW I'M THINKING AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN PUBLIC. THIS IS WHY I DON'T BELIEVE IN AND- WEAKENING OUR CHILD LABOR LAWS BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE TO KNOW IS SO EXTENSIVE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT THAT NOW AND NOW IT'S BECOMING YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO JUSTIFY. THAT'S ON. IF YOU LOOK AT YES SIR A 100% IN IN THE- BUT I'VE APPRECIATED I'M NOT THE SAME IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE ROOM HERE TWO DAYS THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS ENGAGE SINCERELY. AND ON THIS ISSUE- AND ON THE ISSUE OF- O. T. NOT REQUIRED- LABOR COMMISSIONER REPORT- AND SOME ADDITIONAL STATISTICS THAT YOU'VE JUST MENTIONED. WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING AND WOULD WELCOME. FURTHER ENGAGEMENT AND CONVERSATION SINCERELY ON- WHAT SOME OF THOSE DATA POINTS COULD BE. I'M AN THANK YOU AS A SENATOR I THINK THAT. IN SOME IN PERSON. ASPECT OF THE REPORT NOT JUST ONE AND THEN. I WOULD SUGGEST IF IT'S BEING TOUTED AS SOMETHING. FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED THEN EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES I THINK WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT AS WELL. I GOT AROUND OUT ON BUT I KNOW THAT THE SUMMER THEY ARE NO ONE TO MAKE A COMMENT AND SO I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN. YES SIR. CAME IN LATE I HOPE I DIDN'T MISS. MISS TOO MUCH ON THIS. SO YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS THEY'RE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. ARE THEY LIVE IN AN AREA THAT PROBABLY THIS IS. THE PREDOMINANT. WAGE EARNING. JOBS THAT THEY CAN GET- AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT ENABLES THEM. IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. ENABLES THEM TO WORK RAGE SPELLS MUCH AS THEY WANT- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. SO THAT HOPEFULLY WHEN THEY DO GO TO SCHOOL IF THEY DO GRADUATE AND THEY DO GO TO SCHOOL ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY HAVE SOME MONEY. TO DO THAT WITH- THERE ARE TIMES IN. IN IN OUR LIVES. WHEN WE TURN THE SWITCH ON. AND THAT MEANS WE MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE CAN. BECAUSE WE HAVE BILLS TO PAY OR WE HAVE. WE HAVE A LIFE TO TRY TO SET UP. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS THIS IS. ALLOWING THAT NOT FORCING THEM TO DO THAT. I CORRECT SO I MEAN IS THAT. THE PROGRAM IS OPTIONAL RIGHT. AND SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE AT THE AGE WHERE THEY WERE. IN THERE YOU'RE STARTING TO HAVE TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES. THAT THE ADULTS MAKE AND- DINNER SO. AT I DO YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO WEAKEN. OUR CHILD LABOR LAWS THEY THEY'RE THERE FOR YOU THE EXIST FOR A REASON- BUT A LOT OF THOSE ARE EXISTING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE PUT INTO POSITIONS OF ALMOST. SLAVE LABOR. AND I DON'T SEE THIS IS TRYING TO AND YOU KNOW. GO INTO THAT I SEE IT IS TRYING TO- ENABLE THEM TO HAVE A WORK FORCE OUT THERE. NOT HAVE THESE KIDS HAVE TO TRAVEL OUT OF THE AREA TO WORK- AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO WORK AS MUCH IS THEY THEY FEEL LIKE WORKING. AND BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME MONEY FOR THE FUTURE AND YOU KNOW TRY TO MAKE MAKE THEIR LIVES. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO BE. SO I'M NOT AS OPPOSED TO. K. DOING THAT. THE BASED ON OTHER COMMENTS. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ANY OTHER MEMBERS. YES AND AFTER LISTENING TO THE DEBATE AND YOU AND I'VE WORKED. SEVERAL BILLS- BOTH AGREED AND DISAGREED AND I KNOW IN YOUR HEART. YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD IMPACT OR HURT ANYONE. WORDS DO MATTER AND I THINK YOU NEED TO REALLY WORK WITH. THE E. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- TO REALLY GET THIS TO A PLACE WHERE. WHERE WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE- I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS I MEAN BUT THE STATEMENT THAT WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LABOR- IS TROUBLING AND I DON'T THINK YOU MEANT IT THAT WAY THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MAYBE WE NEED TO. TO CHANGE LAWS SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE PEOPLE AND- FOR ME IN AFTER AMERICAN A CHANGE LAWS TO STARTS LABOR AND SELL I DON'T THINK YOU MEANT THAT I DON'T THINK YOU MEANT THAT IN THAT AS AS A FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO GET PEOPLE TO COME TO WORK DIDN'T WORK SO WELL FOR MY PEOPLE. AND SO I JUST NEED YOU TO. KIND OF. WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE LANGUAGE MAVEN BECAUSE YOURE FROM AN AREA THAT MAY NOT. HAVE PEOPLE LIKE. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO. OR FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT COULD HELP YOU. MASSAGE YOUR BEST. WORK IT THROUGH SO THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE. AND SO I'M A LAY OFF TODAY I THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH. AND THEN WE GET TO THE FLOOR WHEN YOU GET THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS I'M HOPING THAT- YOUR SPONSORS.
