GRANTS TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES VICTIMIZED BY RETAIL THEFT TODAY'S PANELISTS INCLUDE BRIAN RUTLEDGE WITH- GOBIZ CAROLINE GRAY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE SIR BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH E. LA- AND TIM WEBER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. LET'S BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CHAIR CARILLO ON MAY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE TERRIBLE AND GRAY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE. I THANK YOU FOR LETTING US. WALK COMMITTEE THROUGH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS RETAIL THEFT CRAP PROGRAM. I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE COMMITTEES TIME AND THAT WILL BEGAN BY RESTATING OUR GOAL. WE DESIGNERS- THIS PROGRAM TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO THE REAL IMPACTS THAT RETAIL HALF IS HAVING ON SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE HERE- WE INTRODUCED THE CONCEPT IN JANUARY AND SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO DESIGN A PROGRAM THAT STRIKES A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN EQUITY AND EFFICIENCY. AND TODAY WE'RE EXCITED TO DISCUSS OUR PLANS ARE FLUSHED OUT PROPOSAL. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED A FRAMEWORK THAT DOES JUST THAT WE'VE STRUCK A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN EQUITY AND EFFICIENCY AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THIS COMMITTEES FEEDBACK. I'M I WILL ALSO OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT- PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DESIGNED THIS PROGRAM TO LOOK A LOT LIKE HELLO SBA'S KOBE NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE TARGETED SMALL BUSINESSES BY BREAKING THEM INTO THREE BUCKETS BASED ON THE ANNUAL GROSS REVENUES. ARE THAT'S HOW WE STRUCTURED THE COVERT RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE FOUND TO BE ADMINISTRATIVELY IN FACT DEATH WITH THAT IN MIND LET ME EXPLAIN AT A HIGH LEVEL HOW THE PROGRAM WILL BURKE. IF. WHILE BUSINESS SIX IS RETAIL STAFF ON OR JANUARY WE ARE ONE TWENTY TWENTY. VACANCY MY RELIEF YOU THIS. THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE IF THEY MEET THE- THAT YOU SEE IN YOUR AGENDA. THERE IS A SITE FIREMEN YOU HAVE TO BE A REGISTERED BUSINESS OR NONPROFIT WITH ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE BETWEEN. FIVE THOUSAND AND FIVE MILLION. THERE'S A CRIME REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO HAVE EXPERIENCED RETAIL THEFT ON YOUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY ON JANUARY ONE OR LATER AND YOU HAVE OUR THROUGH FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY REPORT OR ANY INSURANCE CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED RETAIL THAT. THERE IS THAT AND OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL YOU HAVE TO BE OPEN OR HAVE PLANS TO BE OPEN. AND THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE STATE TAX RETURNS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FOR VALIDATION PURPOSE SAYS. ARE THE FINAL RESULTS IS THAT APPLICANTS WHO ARE FACING RETAIL FACT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES THAT HAVE UNEXPECTED OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO SUPPORT ON THOSE WILL BE- ABLE TO RECEIVE A GRANT THAT WILL COME IN ONE OF. MOUNTS FIVE THOUSAND THAT FOR THOSE WITH ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE I'M BETWEEN. FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT IF THAT REVENUE IS BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ONE MILLION. LASTLY A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT IF THAT REVENUE IS BETWEEN ONE MILLION AND FIVE MILLION SO I WILL STOP HERE AND I KNOW THAT COBIZ AND CALLOUS CALLOW STA ARE OPEN TO QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO JUST TO FOLLOW THE PANEL IS- MISERABLE AGE. ARE YOU PRESENTING LACKS SOME HAVE KOBUS BEHALF OF THIS OF REDLANDS BUDGET OFFICER OKAY WE'LL GO THROUGH- THE ONLY A PLACE. BRAND WHETHER POURED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXPRESSED GOAL FOR THIS PROPOSED NEW GRANT PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE. COMPENSATION TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF RETAIL THEFT. AND AS WE NOTED IN FEBRUARY IMPLEMENTING THIS CONCEPT WOULD FACE A LOT OF PRACTICAL CHALLENGES AND- AT THAT TIME WE HIGHLIGHTED IN PARTICULAR HOW IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DEFINE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND HOW BEST TO DOCUMENT LOSSES THAT BUSINESS OWNERS EXPERIENCE RETAIL THEFT AND- AFTER REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS GRAPPLED WITH THESE CHALLENGES AND HAVE THOUGHTFULLY ATTEMPTED TO BALANCE THE PROGRAM'S REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN CONFLICT IS UNDETERMINED GRAY HAD JUST. OUTLINED FOR YOU SO FOR EXAMPLE THE PROGRAM WILL NEED TO REQUIRE DOCUMENTATION OF A CRIM TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FRAUD WHILE ALSO BEING FLEXIBLE AND SIMPLE ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE BURDEN ON APPLICANTS. NONETHELESS WE KNOW THAT THE DEFINITION OF RETAIL THEFT AND THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ARE BOTH QUITE BROAD. AND THIS RAISES TWO MAJOR CONCERNS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION WILL BE QUICKLY OVERSUBSCRIBED AND SECOND IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE PROGRAM MAY NOT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE IN MIND AS INTENDED. SOME OF THE TWENTY MILLION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED FOR THIS PROGRAM- IN DOLLARS WOULD BE RESERVED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES LEAVING SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRANTS. SO WE DID SOME MATH AND THAT'S AT AN AVERAGE GRANT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE ESTIMATE THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD AWARD FEWER THAN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED GRANTS. SO GIVEN THE BROAD ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WE WOULD EXPECT THE PROGRAM WOULD BECOME QUICKLY OVERSUBSCRIBED. HOWEVER WE SHOULD NOTE THAT NEITHER WE- NOR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CONDUCTED AN ANALYSIS OF THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE VICTIMS OF THEFT ARSON AND VANDALISM. SO WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM WILL BE. AND WHEN I SAY SMALL BUSINESSES I MEAN THAT GENERALLY BECAUSE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT ALMOST ANY OTHER ANY BUSINESS NOT JUST RETAILERS IT'S A VICTIM OF PROPERTY DAMAGE. OR THEFT- ARSON OR VANDALISM WOULD LIKELY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS GRANT. AND SO RETAILERS THE ONLY COMPRISE. MORE PORTION OF THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE ABLE TO SECURE GRANT BEFORE FUNDING IS EXHAUSTED. GIVEN THESE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES WE ARE CONCERNED THAT BY CREATING THIS PROGRAM YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE DOWN THE ROAD- SIMILARLY TO THE SMALL BUSINESS PROVE IT RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM. WHERE MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF FUNDING ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THE DEMANDS. OF LESLIE WERE CONCERNED THAT THE PROGRAM IS RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE SIMILAR PROGRAMS HAVE COSTS OF ONLY AROUND 5% RELATIVE TO THE 15% SET ASIDE FOR THIS PROGRAM. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES POSED BY SETTING UP A NEW COMPLICATED PROGRAM THIS 50% OF THE TWENTY MILLION MAY NOT BEYOND REASONABLE AT ALL. BUT IT DOES- AND FORMER ASSESSMENT OF ITS LIKELY COST EFFECTIVENESS- GIVEN OUR PRIOR- ESTIMATION OF THE AMOUNT OF GRANTS THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM THAT WORKS OUT TO OVER TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PER GRANT. YOU WANT TO CONCLUDE BY REITERATING OUR OVERARCHING GUIDANCE THAT WE PROVIDED IN FEBRUARY. THE YOU CONSIDER WHETHER THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH YOUR BROADER PUBLIC SAFETY. OR PERHAPS IN THIS CASE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES. THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS THANK YOU FINANCE. BY TEN WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I MANY COMMENTS JUST SAYING JUST TO SAY THAT- PUBLIC I REMAIN SOMETHING ADMINISTRATION IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES THAT SUFFERED THE EFFECTS OF THE. THANK YOU I ACTUALLY AND THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. WITH THE RETAIL THEFT PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED SIMILARLY TO THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS FROM LAST YEAR MEANING WILL A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTER THE GRANTS OR WILL GO THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO AS AS THE DIRECTOR GRAY MENTIONED THIS IS EXPRESSLY WE USE THE COVERED RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM AS A MODEL. THE BUCKETS OF MAKING SO ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE PUTS DIFFERENT SMALL BUSINESSES BY SIZE AND- CATEGORY AND THEN GET A GRANT BASED ON THAT. THAT'S WHERE THAT STRUCTURE CAME FROM THE SAME THING FOR IMPLEMENTATION. SO WE WOULD DO A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS- WE'VE NOW HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE THAN WE EVEN DID TWO YEARS AGO SO WE'RE CONFIDENT. THAT THERE ARE- PROVIDERS OUT THERE THAT COULD HELP US WITH THIS- AT THE SO BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WE SEE THIS WORKING THROUGH THAT MODEL. AND IF I'M JUST A FOLLOW UP TO THAT HOW MANY GRANTS ONE OUT RECORDED RELIEF. DIRECTOR GRADE DO YOU HAVE THE LATEST AYE AYE IT'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS- SO I'M NOT SURE DIRECTOR GRAY HAS HAS A OFF THE TOP OF HER HEAD- A ROUGH START. EDS ARE LASTER REPORT HAD. THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN. GRATZ I'M SORRY ONE MORE TIME HOW MANY. YES. THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN FRANCE AND I CANNOT HOLD STAFF DID TO SEE WHETHER I CAN GET IT MORE ACCURATE A NUMBER OF BUT THAT IS WHAT WE DID IN OUR LAST REPORT. SO ACCORDING TO THE L. A. O. THIS THIS WOULD ACTUALLY JUST AWARD ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED GRAMS. THAT'S CORRECT THE SIZE AS THE L. A. O. NOTED WELL THAT'S TO- TO REINSTATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER WEATHERFORD DID SAY BOTH OURSELVES IN THE ALLEY- DON'T HAVE A VERY PRECISE VISION OF WHAT THE FIRST LOOK LIKE. WE WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THAT ESTIMATE IS BROADLY ON TRACK SO HOUSE AND- OR MORE. SO IN MAGNITUDE IT'S DIFFERENT- BUT AGAIN. AS AS HE ALSO BROUGHT UP THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IS A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE TO WHAT WE ORIGINALLY DID WITH THE CODE RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S BECAUSE THIS IS ESSENTIALLY- TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT'S THAT'S MORE COMPLEX ADMINISTRATIVELY. THAN THE COVERED RELIEF GRANT WHICH WAS MORE BROAD BASED THIS IS A SPECIFIC IMPACT THAT BUSINESSES WOULD. WOULD HAVE SO IT'S NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED- SO WILL WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE POINT- THAT THERE'S A MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE. SO WITH THERE SEEMS TO BE AGREEMENT THAT PERHAPS A TWELVE HUNDRED OF HUNDRED BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT. SEEMS TO BE AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER SO HOW DID CODE BIS. PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THE TWENTY MILLION WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM HUNDRED- THAT IS THAT'S NOT WHERE WE A MATCH AND WE DON'T HAVE A PRECISE. VISION WE THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE MINIMUM THAT WOULD WOULD BENEFIT. THE ESTIMATE WAS BASED ON ONE AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS. ONE OF THE BIG THEMES AS FISCAL RESILIENCY- WE'RE TRYING TO. BALANCE THE TRADE OFF OF THE TO REAL NEED OUT THERE. WITH WHAT CAN WE DO BILL AND SO THERE'S VARIOUS APPROACHES. TO WE THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE APPROACH WE THINK. WITH GRANT AMOUNTS OF THIS SIZE. WE WOULD HAVE SOME LEGITIMATE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO THOSE. WE WOULD KEEP THEM OPERATIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY AFLOAT- WHEN THEY'RE AT RISK OF. OF BEING- YOU KNOW CLOSING THEIR DOORS AND POTENTIALLY NOT COMING BACK FROM THIS SO THAT WAS THE UNDERLYING GOAL HERE- WE- USE OUR BEST ESTIMATE FOR TWENTY MILLION ESSENTIALLY. WELL LET'S DIVE DEEP ARE A LITTLE BIT INTO FISCAL RESILIENCY IN FUNDING BENEFITS. WHERE THE GRANTS AWARDED BY THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESS VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF ON COVERED LOSSES TO THE BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE A BUSINESS THAT MADE ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON THEIR LAST TAX RETURN BUT HAD A RETAIL THEFT FIVE THOUSAND. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE AWARDED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A GROUND FORCES THE FIVE THOUSAND IN THE RETAIL THEFT. THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMPLEXITY THERE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MATCH THE AVAILABLE STATE RESOURCES WITH. ME THAT A BUSINESS SIX. WE HAVE TALKED L. L. ABOUT THAT AND- AS AS MR WHETHER NOTED WE GRAPPLE WITH THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS AND FROM OUR VIEW WHERE LAND HERE. THIS THE ONE WAY TO DO THIS PROGRAM YOU OFFER EVERYONE THE SAME FLAT AMOUNT OF RELIEF. THAT WOULD BE INEQUITABLE IN OUR VIEW- THE OTHER THING YOU COULD DO IS YOU COULD TRY TO DETAIL THE DOLLAR BY DOLLAR AMOUNT OF A- OF A REVENUE IMPACT THEIR BUSINESS EXPERIENCES. FROM OUR VIEW THAT'S ADMINISTRATIVELY UNREALISTIC AND GETS MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE- SO. WE TRIED TO. BALANCE THAT AND WHERE WE LANDED WAS THIS WAY BY USING ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE AS THE DEFINING THE BUCKETS AND THEN ALSO DEFINING. FREE FIXED GRANT AMOUNTS THAT SIMPLIFIES FOR BOTH OURSELVES AS THE ADMINISTRATORS THAT ALSO SIMPLIFIES INTERVIEW FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO. IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DOCUMENT YOUR DOLLAR BY DOLLAR IMPACT- SO THIS IS BASICALLY A ATTEMPT TO BALANCE. YEAH I'D YOU KNOW I'M I'M HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHY WE WOULD USE TAX DOLLARS ARE PUBLIC DOLLARS TO AWARD SOMEONE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHEN THEY ONLY HAD FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF. RETAIL THEFT I'M NOT SURE. THAT THE MATH ADDS UP. I'LL JUST MAKE ONE MORE POINT WHICH IS- AND I WOULD TAKE WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT CONCERNED. WOULD SAY THAT IN THIS LANGUAGE WHAT WE'VE DONE TO MITIGATE THAT IS REQUIRED THAT. THE ONLY USE THAT A GRANTEE CAN MAKE OF THESE DOLLARS. IS TOWARDS OF. A AN EXPENSE THAT WAS NOT COVERED BY AN EXISTING INSURANCE CLAIMS. SO ESSENTIALLY IF YOU'RE A LARGE BUSINESS IN THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE- THEY'VE ALREADY. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IF THEY'RE ON THE LARGER- THE HIGHER SCALE THESE ANNUAL REVENUES. THEY PROBABLY HAVE INSURANCE AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SORT OF MAXIMIZE THEIR INSURANCE CLAIM. AND SO THIS WOULD SUPPORT THEM- AND SORT OF FILL IN A GAP ON POTENTIALLY REVENUE LOSS FROM CLOSED DOORS OF THAT SORTOF THING. SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUT WOULD WE'VE DONE OUR OUR- WE OFFERED WHAT WE THINK IS A REASONABLE APPROACH TO MITIGATE PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES THOUGH YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT LARGE BUSINESSES. I'LL CLARIFY THAT THAT'S IN THE SCALE OF THE THREE REVENUE BUCKETS I MEANT THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE WAS FROM WHAT IF A BUSINESS. THAT'S A YOU KNOW THREE MILLION ANNUAL REVENUE THAT BUSINESS IS LARGER THAN. THE BUSINESS WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND. BUT IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY THAT'S CAN STILL BE A SMALL BUSINESS- IT'S BROADLY SIMILAR TO THE COVERED RELIEF GRANT IN THAT WAY IN TERMS OF THRESHOLD OKAY AS I'VE I DID SAY ONE MILLION NOT THREE BUT THAT'S OKAY I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVEY. I DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS BUT I DO WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO ASK ANYTHING ELSE. I WANTED TO- JUST ASK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUTRAGE SO IS IT A FIRST COME FIRST SERVED SURFERS ARE SERVE BASIS WILL THE OUT REACH FOR THE PROGRAM- BE OPEN AHEAD OF TIME HOW WILL WE ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS. RESHOOT THAT THAT QUESTION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE GRAPPLED WITH AND- AS THE DRESS DIRECTOR GRAY MENTIONED THIS IS OUR EFFICIENCY HERE WHERE. IF WE START TO ADD FILTERS ON WHO'S ELIGIBLE AND WE TRY TO SAY LET'S PRIORITIZE ACTS BY GEOGRAPHY WHY BY- SOME DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. THE PROBLEM IS FOR BOTH THE SMALL BUSINESS THAT CREATES AN ADDED BURDEN OF TRYING TO JUMP THROUGH THE HOOP AND PROVE THAT YOU FALL INTO THAT. AND ALSO FOR THE ADMINISTRATION PERSPECTIVE OF IMPLEMENTING THIS IT ADDS A COMPLEXITY THERE- SO WE ARE TRYING TO. GET THIS ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS BECAUSE WE'RE THINKING- IT'S MORE EQUITABLE OR IT'S AN EQUITABLE GOAL TO GET THE FUNDING OUT QUICKER. KNOWING THAT IF YOU ARE BUSINESS WITH HUNDRED K. ANNUAL REVENUE. AND GET THE SCRIPT AT- THE DIFFERENCE IN A MONTH OF GETTING IT WHICH THIS WHICH TO DIFFERENT WAYS OF A- DEFINING ELIGIBILITY MIGHT SLOW DOWN- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT'S IT'S WORTH THAT. SO WE SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT EQUITY AND THIS IS OUR ABILITY TO TRY TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE. IT HAS BEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LAST TWO YEARSAMID COVE IT AND CALL IT RECOVERY EFFORTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT. ITS MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES A BUSINESSES WHERE IS. WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH- HAVE HAD.  THE BEST RESULTS IN TERMS OF ONE RECEIVING FUNDING RECEIVING RESOURCES HAVING ACCESS TO RESOURCES. SO WHAT IS WHAT IS THE- I GUESS OUT REACH APPROACH AND HOW YOU ARE GOING TO. HELP THOSE MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES IF IT'S ONLY ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS WHERE IT'S THOSE THAT ARE MOST SAVVY. THAT WILL HAVE ACCESS. FREESHIP THAT POINT AS WELL. THE IT AS A DIRECTOR GREAT CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE HOW THE CODE RELIEF GRANT OUT REACH WORKS AND HOW THAT'S A MODEL THAT WE WOULD USE. ABSOLUTELY I THANK YOU I'M SURE COULD BE- THAT IN- RECOGNIZING THE CONCERN FOR OUT REACH- THAT ARE UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES. WE WOULD DEFINITELY FOLLOW THE MODEL WHICH FRANKLY WE ARE PERFECTING. ARE FROM IT STARTED WITH THE COVERED RELIEF GRANT- PROGRAM BUT FRANKLY WE HAVE MODELED THAT OUTREACH IN ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS NOW. AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH- STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR STANDING UP A PROGRAM. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- PARTNERS THAT ARE PROVIDING OUTREACH. ON THE END ENGAGEMENT ARE IN LANGUAGE AND MAKING SURE THAT I'D- WE CAST THAT NET. AS FAR AND AS WIDE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. OUR PARKERSBURG THIRTY LANGUAGES AND WE WOULD HAVE THIS EXPECTATION. OF OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS AND ECOSYSTEM TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM. IN THE EXACT SAME MANNER. THANK YOU DIRECTOR GRAY JUST AT ONE POINT WHICH IS THAT IN THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WE DID SPECIFY THAT A CALLOW IS BA AND THE THIRD PARTY PROVIDER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO. CONDUCT EXPENSES- EXPECTS BANDS OF. AN EXTENSIVE OUTREACH- BAKER DON ESSENTIALLY THE COVER GRANDMA ALSO AS DIRECTOR GRAY WAS MENTIONING WE'VE WE HAVE A MODEL THAT WE THINK IT'S EFFECTIVE FOR MAKING SURE. FOLKS THAT THE NEED EXTRA AWARENESS FOR ASSISTANCE- CAN GET THAT. THANK YOU I WANNA ASK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MISTER LUCKY TO SAY THE ENORMITY OF THIS PROBLEM AS THE- IS. AND I'M THANKFUL LEASE WERE DRESSING IT IN SOME MANNER AT THIS TIME AND I'M THANKFUL THAT WERE. AT LEAST RECOGNIZING IT BUT- I HAVE A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION WHY. WHY IS ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT PENAL CODE FOR NINETY POINT FOR NOT INCLUDED. WE HAVE NINE OTHER STATUTES THAT ARE INCLUDED- THIS IS A STANDALONE CRIME. A FOUR NINETY POINT FOUR IS NOT AN ENHANCEMENT SO SHOULD BE INCLUDED- THE OMISSION OF THIS CRIME HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LANGUAGE AS PROPOSAL LIKELY CREATE MORE CONFUSION. AN ACTUAL BUREAUCRACY THAN GETTING MONEY TO THOSE AFFECTED BY CRIME. PRESHEAF THE QUESTION AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON MAKING SURE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL- THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE A REALLY HELPFUL CONTRIBUTION IF WE INCLUDED IT SELL OUT HAPPY TO. THE LOOK FORWARD TO MORE INPUT THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY AND WON- JUST FINAL QUESTION FOR ME IS THIS GRANT ONLY OPEN FOR A RETAILER OR FOR ALL SMALL BUSINESSES THERE'S A BROKEN WINDOW UNDER THE LANGUAGE QUALIFY AS RETAIL THEFT. THANK YOU SO WE DIDN'T DEFINE THIS AS A RETAILER SPECIFIC WE COULD HAVE USED THE NEXT CODE FOR EXAMPLE TO MAKE IT RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN RETAIL BUSINESSES BUT OUR GOAL HERE IS TO ADD TO MITIGATE A CERTAIN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IT'S NOT TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC TYPE OF BUSINESS. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE IN MIND NOT JUST A CLOTHING STORE SOMETHING SELLS COMMODITIES THERE COULD BE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THAT SAME BUSINESS- BUSINESS SERVICES FIRM THAT- EXPERIENCES A SIMILAR TALE CRAP- WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS INCLUSIVE AND AVAILABLE TO SORT OF A THE IN RATHER THAN. NEXTCODE L. TYPE A BILL. SELFRIDGE A REST WHO HAS THEIR WINDOWS BROKEN AND THEIR CHAINS BROKEN IN THEY'RE REGISTER STOLEN AND THERE. TABLES AND CHAIRS STOLEN WOULD QUALIFY. AS AS WRITTEN THAT IS THAT IS IT WOULD DEPEND ON A COUPLE FACTORS AS WRITTEN BUT ESSENTIALLY YES- THE IDEA IS THAT. IT'S ALSO KEY TO NOTE THAT AS WRITTEN WE HAVE IT SO INSURANCE OUR EXISTING INSURANCE CLAIMS WOULD WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE USES OF THE FUNDING SO IF YOU'RE A RESTAURANT YOU HAD INSURANCE. AND LET'S SAY INSURANCE COVERED YOU FOR THE BROKEN WINDOW- THEN THAT WOULDN'T BE AN ELIGIBLE EXPENSE BUT WHAT BE THE SHIRLEY TURNS DOESN'T COVER YOU. HAVE TODAY AT THE CLOSE THAT ONE SO YOU CAN GET SOME SORT OF SOME FROM THE STATE HERE AFTER THAT LOST REVENUE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IMPACTFUL. THAT IT THANK YOU. THERE AREN'T MORE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. OF THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO THANK YOU SO MUCH GENTLEMEN AND THANK YOU DIRECTOR. SHE IS. FROM YOUR YOUR CAR HOPE YOU'RE AND- THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA GO ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO SALES AND USE OF TAX EXCLUSION.

ENFORCEMENT OF MISSIONS ENHANCEMENTS CONCILIATION SENHANCE MEANT. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT'S CHAIRMAN AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE MILLER I AM D. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING OUR FIRST PROPOSAL RESOURCES TO DECREASE WAIT TIMES FOR INVESTIGATIVE APPOINTMENTS. BRITAIN'S SINCE AND SETTLEMENTS WITH OUR ENFORCEMENT OF. RELATED TO BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING COMPLAINTS HISTORICALLY THE TYPICAL AVERAGE WAIT TIME BETWEEN THE INTAKE OF A COMPLAINT IN THE INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEWS APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS. LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT EXPERIENCED A SURGE IN COMPLAINTS THAT INCREASE THE WAIT TIMES BEEN EMPLOYMENT FROM THREE MONTHS TO FORM IT'S AN HOUSING FROM THREE MONTHS TO SIX MONTHS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CAN INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF THE LABOR MARKET AND WITH IMPENDING REACHED A VERY STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL EXPLORATORIUM'S DESIGNED TO PROTECT TENANTS DURING COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WAIT TIMES IN BOTH ND HOUSING HAVE DECREASED AGAIN TO APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OVERALL. THROUGH THE USE OF OUT OF CLASSES CITING ITS STRATEGIC OVERTIME AND RECRUITMENT OF RETIRED ANNUITANTS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW US TO DO. WE TIME FROM THREE MONTHS TO ONE MONTH AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CASES OUR INVESTIGATORS ARE ABLE TO CONCILIATE OR SUBTLE. JAMIE TODAY'S MERRY WEEK DLPH CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU L. A. O. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS NOTICED MORE HONEST WITH THE L. A. O. WE HAVE NO ISSUES TO RAISE ON THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MORALIS DEPARTMENT FINANCE. ENTER MARCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FOR THE COMING YEAR MIKE WAS A NON. HELLO OKAY ANJA MARX DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FURTHER COMMENT. THANK YOU JUST ONE QUESTION FOR ME BEFORE I PASS IT ON TO OUR COMMITTEE DOES THE P. E. H. PLAN TO ADDRESS VACANCY ISSUES AT THE DEPARTMENT. WE DO STOP ALSO OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC- WE LIKE MANY DEPARTMENTS WERE NOT IMMUNE TO THE GREAT RESIGNATION. OUR ENFORCEMENT VACANCY RATE RIGHT NOW STANDS AT THIRTEEN PERCENT. WE'VE DONE SEVERAL THINGS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO HELP REDUCE THE VACANCY RATE WE'VE INSTITUTED CONTINUOUS JOB POSTINGS FOR OUR INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS IN BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. WE PULL APPLICATIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OUR FIRST WAS JANUARY FIFTEENTH AND WE HOPE LEVIN PEOPLE ARE SECOND CUT OFF JUST OCCURRED APRIL IFTEENTH TWO WEEKS AGO AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT WILL FILL OUR REMAINING INVESTIGATOR VACANCIES IN THE COMING MONTH. AND WE ADVERTISE AND TRY TO RECRUIT FOR MULTIPLE PLATFORMS BESIDES JUST COLLEGE ARE ON OUR OWN WEBSITE WE'RE POSTING ALL OF OUR POSITIONS ON LINKEDIN THROUGH RECRUITER. AND WE'RE ADVERTISING OPENINGS THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. SIMPLICITY WITH. OF UP GREATER NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED CLARIFICATION IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- YES MISTER COOPER I HAVE WILSHIRE I THINK THE REALLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE PAY FOR THE STATE SUCKS SO WHILE YOU WORK FOR THE STATE. REFER LOOK MUNICIPALITY POLICE OR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MAKE MORE MONEY AND THEN TO ME IF YOU'RE INVESTIGATOR FOR THE STATE WITH YOUR IT IT EASY D. OR OR OR WELFARE FRAUD OR- CANNABIS OR WHOEVER CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO THE SAME PACE SKILL WHERE EVERY OTHER ORGANIZATION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAS THAT EXCEPT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO CAN YOU DRESS THAT IT AND THEN ALSO GEN RE HOW MANY FOLKS ARE WALKING OUT THE DOOR AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I URGE. RATE HAS. BEEN THAT DRAMATIC OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IF. WE DID HAVE A SPIKE EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC. WE WERE VERY QUICK TO ADOPT HEALTH WORK. ON THAT I THINK THAT HELPED QUITE A BIT- IN RETAINING OUR PEOPLE BUT I THINK OVER THE COURSE OF TIME IS AS PEOPLE REALIZE THEY COULD DO. ALMOST ANY JOB FROM ANYWHERE- THIS IS A TOUGH JOB IT'S NOT EASY AND WE DO HAVE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR DECADES WE HAVE SOME OF THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAM- TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. BUT WE FREQUENTLY DEAL WITH PEOPLE ON THE WORST DAYS OF THEIR LIVES THEY LOST THEIR JOBS. THEY'VE BEEN DISCRIMINATED OR HARASSED THE LOSS THE ROUTINE YOU'RE LOSING THEIR HOME. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS TO HELP OUR INVESTIGATORS- YOU KNOW MAINTAIN THEIR SENSE OF BALANCE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I PROTECT PERSON TO ADDRESS THE RATE OF STATE HEY THAT MIGHT BE A QUESTION PAPER DIRECTLY CAN ONLY CHART- WE ARE RESTRICTED BY STATE CLASSIFICATIONS SO WE CAN ONLY GO BY THE MIN AND MAX OF THOSE- BUT WE DO DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH ABILITY PROGRAM- THEY WERE ABLE TO TRANSFER PEOPLE FROM- YOU KNOW. THIS TO SPECIALIST AND EVEN SUPERVISORS. YEAH I THOUGHT. YES MY- BY ON THE CAN FOR YOU NOW. AND THE PAY. I SAID IT VARIES I MEAN INVESTIGATORS INVESTIGATOR. YOU CALL THE SAME BACKGROUND AND TRAINING. BUT IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE OR SIDE LETTERS FOR A LOT OF FOLKS. THAT VERY DIFFERENTLY AND THAT'S THE REALITY I GUESS SAID. YOU CAN MAKE MORE IT COULD C. H. P. TENS. A RESEARCHER DEPARTMENT THEN THEY MAKE IN THESE POSITIONS IT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY. AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ISSUE WITH HIRING AND GETTING FOLKS TO COME IN. FOR SOME FOLKS WILL COME IN AND GET THEIR TRAINING THEN LEAVE. THE STATE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ONCE ONCE THEY'VE ACQUIRED THE KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING FLIGHTS. IT'S BEEN A CONTINUAL ISSUE SO- I'D I'D BE CURIOUS ABOUT THAT IN AN ALSO. KELLY CHARGE PAR THE PROBLEM. IF BESIDE- WITH EVENING LOOK AT THE COW FOR INSTANCE. OKAY SURPLUS. IF YOU'RE A CERTAIN CLASSIFICATION. THERE'S A PAY SCALE FOR THAT. NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE. IN OF YOUR GOODWILL HERE WHETHER YOUR INVESTIGATOR FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THE UBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IT'S THE SAME PAY SCALE IS NOT THAT WAY AND TO ME WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT OTHERWISE. YOU CONTINUE TO GET FOLKS THAT LOOK AT ESPECIALLY NOW. THE SHOP AROUND WHOSE PAY IS MORE LUCRATIVE. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IS NOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S THAT'S A REALITY. THANK YOU NUMBER HERE. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER KNOW WHAT IT IS R.

AND TO ALSO SUPPORT RESOLVING ENCAMPMENTS SITES ACROSS THE STATE AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THIS REQUEST BUILDS ON THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME PAYMENT RESOLUTION PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WHICH- OR- IN THIS FIRST ITERATION OF THE- WE RECEIVE REQUIRE FOR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR PROGRAMS IN DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR NEIGHBORS LIVING IN ENCAMPMENTS SO MORE THAN TWICE THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION MANY OF THE JURISDICTIONS THAT REACHED OUT TO US EXPRESSED THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY SUBMITTED MULTIPLE PROPOSALS TO RESOLVE MULTIPLE ENCAMPMENTS ACROSS OUR COMMUNITY IF MORE FUNDING HAD BEEN AVAILABLE- IN ADDITION. THE NEED FOR A MUCH LARGER SCALE PROGRAM IS REFLECTED IN THE MOST RECENT POINT IN TIME COUNT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHICH REFLECTED THAT TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE UNSHELTERED THAT'S OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THE HIGHEST RATE IN THE NATION.

SOLVING ISSUE I'M SO WITHOUT I WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LOL. MELISSA LEO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED AUGMENTATION THE NEW KEVIN RECOGNITION PROGRAM IS MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE ABOVE WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED FOR THE PROGRAM AT THE TIME WE RELEASED FOR JANUARY BUDGET VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THE ORIGINAL FIFTY MILLION AUGMENTATION WAS BEING USED AS A RESULT WE COULD NOT ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM SINCE THEN THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION EXCUSE ME HAD ANNOUNCED. THE AWARD OF THE ORIGINAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WE ALSO SUGGESTED THE LOGISTICS THE TICKET AND DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM BEFORE ANY DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION THAT SUCH THE QUESTIONS REASON THE. AGENDA ARE APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. AS A PART OF FINANCE PLEASE. RIDLEY THOMAS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THE COMMITTEE. OKAY I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS CAN A CALLOUS CH EXPLAINED THE PROCESS OF HOW GRANTS WERE AWARDED FOR THIS PROGRAM. ABSOLUTELY SO UNLIKE OUR OTHER GRANTS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE MINISTER WHICH ARE AWARDED ON A FORMULA BLOCK PROCESS THAT IS PROPORTIONALLY ALLOCATED BASED ON POPULATION OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN ELIGIBLE COMMUNITIES THIS WAS A COMPETITIVE BE AWARDED CORRECT- AND ANOTHER KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS GRANT AND PRIVATE CALLAS YOU. IT IS THIS COMES OPEN TO CITY OF ANY SIZE IN ADDITION TO COUNTIES CONTINUE OF THAT CARE AND THE LARGEST CITIES- SO AS COMPETITIVELY- ADMINISTER GRANTS. EACH PROPOSAL WAS SCORED INDIVIDUALLY BY A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF EVALUATORS USING CRITERIA THAT WAS OUTLAWED IT THE PUBLIC. OKAY DESCRIBE ARE BETTER CALLS THAT HELLO IN ADVANCE OF THE MINDS OF- SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS THINGS THE GRANTEES COME AND EXPERT- THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE ENCAMPMENT THAT WAS GOING TO BE SERVED- MODEL- FIRST WORDS SERVICE. AND OF GREAT CONCERN IS HEALTH WELLNESS AND PERSON CENTERED APPROACH TO SERVING THE PEOPLE- IN THE PROPOSAL- AND RECOGNIZING THE VERY LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE- THERE WAS AN EYE TOWARDS INTIMIDATION BECAUSE OF COURSE THIS FIRST ITERATION OF THE IN CABIN GRANT WAS INTENDED TO BE- FOR PILOT PROJECTS. SO THAT WE CAN FIND SOME OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES THAT COULD EVENTUALLY BE SCALED UP OR DOWN FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IN AWARDING THESE GRANTS IS THAT STATUE DID REQUIRED TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE THE STATE AWARDED GRANTS IN A MANNER THAT RIGHT. THE DIVERSITY OF UNITY PROCESS STATE SO AND FOR THAT ALL TYPES OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA HI ACCESS. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE DETAILS AS TO WHO I'M LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AND THE CITIES THAT WERE. AWARDED FOR EXAMPLE CITY OF FRESNO WAS AWARDED FIVE MILLION TO RE HOUSE ONE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS. WILD SALMON MEDINA COUNTY WAS AWARDED ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION TO HOUSE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS. WHAT'S THE COST DIFFERENCE. SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO WHY SOME- GRANTS WERE AWARDED BASED ON THE COST DIFFERENCE- YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SORT OF MODEL AND THAT'S WHY A ON THIS WAS COMPETITIVELY- THIS WAS COMPETITIVELY ADMINISTRATOR INSTEAD OF USING SOME KIND OF RATTA YOU KNOW FUNDING FOR PERSONS SERVING SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFERENCE. SIR ARE. WORD BRING WAS GOING TO BE FUNDED DIRECTLY BY THE PROGRAM THERE WERE SOME INSTANCES WHERE THESE FUNDS AND THE PROPOSAL WERE ESSENTIALLY SEED MONEY. AND THAT WAS IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAD ROBUST EXISTING RESOURCES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED AND THESE FLEXIBLE FUNDING SOURCES WOULD HELP- BREAK FUNDING GAPS AND ACCELERATE- EFFORTS- THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER RESOURCES AND SO THEY WERE MUCH MORE. RELY SOLELY ON THESE WITH WRAPAROUND NEEDS AND SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMMUNITY WHERE. A WHERE IN THESE THESE DOLLARS WERE JUST NEEDED TO DO THE INITIAL OUTREACH OR TO DO THE SHOW INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU MIGHT HAVE A MUCH LOWER PERSON LAST THEN ON. WHERE MAY NOT BE AS MANY EXIST. LOCAL RESOURCE LEVERAGE AND WORDS DOLLARS HAD TO PROVIDE MOST ASPECTS OF. THE SERVICE DELIVERY. THANK YOU I GUESS I OWE FOR UP WITH YOU AND WITH STAFF I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT. WHAT THOSE DIFFERENCES WERE AS TO WHO EXACTLY HAD SEED MONEY VERSUS. A EXISTING PROGRAMS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD THOSE DETAILS WILL HELP US DETERMINE. WHERE ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES CAN GO WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T AND- I'M- NOT NECESSARILY TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL BUT CERTAINLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE PUT MORE RESOURCES INTO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WORK- I WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT RECEIVED A GRANT FOR ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. TO RE HOUSE SIX C. INDIVIDUALS AND MAYBE DO A COMPARISON OF WHAT OTHER TYPE OF AWARDS THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS RECEIVED I ONLY BRING IT UP NOT ONLY BECAUSE I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LA BUT BECAUSE SKID ROW WAS IN OUR BACKYARD. SKID ROW IS THE LARGEST HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT CENTER COMMUNITY IN THE NATION AND SO TO SEE. OF YOU KNOW A GRANT TO ONE POINT SEVEN TO ONLY RE HOUSE SIXTY. I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO. WHAT PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO HELP THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MANAGER THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND OF COURSE WE SHARE YOUR CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO- YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES IS ONE OF THE EPICENTERS OF THIS CRISIS. OF COURSE THAT. LARGE PART BY PUTTING. FORWARD BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE YES THE INITIAL ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS CANCER PORT PILOT PROJECTS THAT COULD EVENTUALLY BE STUDIED AND SCALED UP AS YOU ALLUDED TO- THERE'S URGENCY AND A SCOPE OF THE CRISIS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT. WE ARE OF COURSE POLICE ISN'T. A SENSE. NO FUNDING POSTED. L. RIGHT FUNDING THIS I'M AS I IN MY PREVIOUS- THIS PROGRAM WAS COMPETITIVE BID RATHER THAN BET ON A PROPORTIONAL FORMULA SO FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR HEALTH PROGRAMS- A LITTLE OVER 40% OF THE TOTAL ALLOCATION STATEWIDE APPLICATION- TO. WRECK IT. IT COMMUNITY- AND I HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH THE- LOS ANGELES- YOU KNOW HOUSING SERVICES AUTHORITY UP THERE PROPOSAL THAT THEY SUBMITTED AND THIS PROGRAM AS DESIGNED- WOULD PUT THEM AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE TO RECEIVE FUNDING. AS SOON AS YOU'RE OUT. NAME OF A LOCAL- YOU KNOW AND I WOULD ALSO. THAT A TWO OF THE NINETEEN AWARDS- WERE IN L. A. COUNTY LONG CITY OF LONG BEACH AND CITY OF LA AND HEY WERE AMONGST OUR HIGHEST COURT APPLICANTS. I NEED TO WORK WITH THAT- AND POTENTIALLY SCARE BOB POSITIONAL FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE IN A VERY INTERESTING SPACE WHERE WE HAVE TO RAMP UP QUICKLY AND URGENTLY THEY WERE JUST YOU KNOW PUTTING MORE MONEY OUT THERE ARE NOT SEEN THE RESULTS THAT MANY OF OUR YOU KNOW CONSTITUENTS WANT TO SEE IN TERMS OF- RESOLVING THIS MAN'S IMMENSE- TO THAT WE'RE ALL FACING.

THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE GOOD AFTERNOON MIKE MCGINNIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU I HAD I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- RELATED TO WHAT WAS DISCUSSED WHAT IS THE CURRENT OCCUPANCY RATE FOR THE EXISTING PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE STRUCTURE HAS THE PARK. EXPERIENCE CAPACITY ISSUES IN THE PAST. SURE SO THE PARK EXPERIENCES SURGES SO- THE PRIMARY USE OF THOSE PARKING AREAS IS TO ACCOMMODATE AND RESPOND TO SPECIAL EVENTS- CURRENTLY WE USE THAT SPACE NOT A HUNDRED. PER CALENDAR YEAR OF OBVIOUSLY THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WITH KOPET HAS CHANGED GREATLY. ON WE HAVE A 7% OCCUPANCY RATE FOR THAT AREA WHICH- SEVERAL. RELIES ON A DAILY BASIS- IN REGARD TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT CAPACITY ISSUES SO- EXPOSITION PARK IS HOME TO TWO MAJOR STADIUM BANK OF CALIFORNIA STADIUM AS WELL THE COLISEUM. AT ANY GIVEN TIME WHEN THEY DO HOSTED BANDS- WE DO REACH CAPACITY ACROSS THE PARK AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL PARKING NEEDS- AND THOSE TO GET USED TO FULL CAPACITY DURING THOSE MAJOR EVENTS. AND WILL THE STATE THAT YOU MAY CONSIDER ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVES OTHER THAN AN UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE. THE STUDY WILL NOT CONSIDER OTHER ALTERNATIVES- AT AS AS IT RELATES TO ABOUT PARKING STRUCTURE ON A POLICY OF THIS THIS UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE WHAT'S THAT AND QUOTED INDEED EXPOSITION PARK MASTER PLAN. WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AND SUPPORTED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY PARKS STAKEHOLDERS- AND THAT IDEA OF AN UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE WOULD MAXIMIZE THE USE AND PROVIDES. HERNANDEZ. THANK YOU FOR THAT I WENT TO USC SOME VERY FAMILIAR- WITH THAT LOCATION IN THE PARKING DIFFERENT MUSEUMS AND THE NEW STADIUM AND ALL OF THAT AND YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT COMES TO MIND BEING FROM LOS ANGELES IS JUST WE WANT TO RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. BUT IT JUST ISN'T THERE AS QUICK WE WILL LIKE IT AND SO LA IS STILL VERY CAR CULTURE CITY UNTIL YOU KNOW WE HAVE- MORE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE VASTLY ME. FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SUCH. IT THAT THIS GOING TO SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU WHY IS THE CITY WHY IS A STUDY OR THE PARKWAY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF THE EXPOSITION PARK IMPROVEMENT FUND. THESE PROPOSALS BE APPROVED WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED REQUESTED SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR CONSTRUCTION. OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROJECTS. SURE SO FOR THE UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE- SARZAMEEN MAY GO BACK TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING SOURCES SO THE EPRDF WHICH IS A SPECIAL FUNDS IS UNSUPPORTED PRIMARILY FROM PARKING REVENUE- OFFENSE LEAST REVENUE WILL. RENTAL RENT REVENUES AND EXPECTATIONS- WITHIN THE PARK- OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE STATE OR MORTARBOARD ORDERS SB CLOSURES AT THE MUSEUM- AND EVENTS. OF THE EPA EFE HAS HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN ESTIMATED- AND WENT FROM COLLECTING A BALANCE OF NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION TO ABOUT PROXIMITY FOUR MILLION OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND SO AT THIS MOMENT- THE EPF WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE THESE. REQUESTS THE TERMS OF THE CONSTRUCTION COST THIS. WOULD. A NUMBER FOR. CALLS AT THAT TIME WE WOULD- INVESTIGATE ALL POSSIBLE. FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING FEDERAL- LORS AND- GENERAL FUND- BOND- MEASURE BORDER. OVER THOSE. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE ONTO ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN THE ARTS COUNCIL. WE WILL HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL SPRING FINANCE LETTER LET'S BEGIN. HELLO HI. HELLO CHAIR CARILLO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COOPER LACKING IS ERIN AND WICKS ON MY NAME IS JONATHAN MOSCONI AND I AM THE NEW APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF THE ARTS SO. I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF IN MY THIRTY FIVE YEARS AS AN ARTS PRACTITIONER I'VE GONE FROM MAKING ART TO MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR OTHERS TO MAKE ART AND I TAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO MY NEW ROLE. TO SUPPORT AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE AND AS EQUITABLY AS POSSIBLE. I AM BRAND NEW TO THIS JOB AND I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND I'M GRATEFUL TO BE VIRTUALLY HERE WITH OUR DIRECTOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR AYE JANAKPURI. AND DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS PRESSED MARGOLIS TO TALK IN DETAIL ABOUT THE TWO AGENDA ITEMS CULTURAL DISTRICTS AND REAPPROPRIATION. FOR ME RIGHT NOW I KNOW THAT I MUST START MY JOB IS LISTENING. AND TO THAT END I WILL BE SPENDING THE NEXT NINETY DAYS. GOING ACROSS THE STATE TO LISTEN TO EVERYONE SO I HAVE THE BEST CHANCE INSURING THAT OUR WORK REFLECTS THE VOICES OF STAKEHOLDERS. LISTENING AND COMMUNICATING. AND THIS STARTS AT HOME WITH OUR HARD WORKING STAFF. OUR COUNCIL THE LEGISLATURE YOU MINISTRATION. ALL THE FOLKS DOING THE GREAT WORK THROUGHOUT THIS. IN RURAL SUBURBAN AND URBAN LOCATIONS SUCH AS CULTURAL DISTRICTS. WHERE THE FOCUS OF A THIRTY MONTH MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION. PUT FORTH BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. MY KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURAL DISTRICTS COMES FIRST HAND FROM MY WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO ALONG SIDE SOME UP LOOKING US FILIPINO CULTURAL HERITAGE DISTRICT. THIS ORGANIZATION IS LED BY AND WORKS WITH COMMUNITIES. THAT IN HISTORICALLY EITHER THEY HAVE TURNED IT INTO ONE OF THE MOST VIBRANT CENTERS IN OUR CITY WITH CULTURAL CELEBRATION COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AT THE COURT IN PRACTICE THEY LIKE THE FOURTEEN DESIGNATED GEOGRAPHICALLY AND RACIALLY DIVERSE CULTURAL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THE MANY NON DESIGNATED CULTURAL. AND YOU SO MUCH WITH SO LITTLE FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO DO I BELIEVE IS TO INVEST MORE DEEPLY IN THEM. STRENGTH AND THEIR IMPACT SUSTAIN THRIVING RESILIENT BUSINESSES INCREASED TOURISM AND OPPOSE THE CULTURES THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA A GENUINELY GREAT STATE. AND THAT INCLUDES COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THE LOT NEXT COMMUNITY IN THE FIFTY FIRST DISTRICT. THE CHINESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY THE NINETEENTH DISTRICT THE AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURAL DISTRICT AND INDEED PRIORITIZING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE THE DISTRICTS REPRESENTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITHIN UNDER RESOURCE YEAH ARE AMONG THE GREATEST ASSETS IN REBUILDING A BETTER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. HOW DO I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY AND IN GUARD ENGAGE IN START THESE COMMUNITIES THE CDC HAS PROVEN TRACK RECORD WITH ITS PROGRAMS SUCH AS CULTURE OUTWEIGHS WOULD STRENGTHEN. CASSIDY A SMALL NEW AND EMERGING ARTS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ROOTED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR RECENT IMMIGRANT RECIPE REFUGEE COMMUNITIES AND TRIBAL AND INDIGENOUS GROUPS. ARTS IN CORRECTIONS. A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND THE ARTS COUNCIL THAT HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE TRAUMA OF INCARCERATION. AND PROMOTING HEALING AND INTERPERSONAL TRANSFORMATION BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ARTS COUNCIL PRACTICES JUST AND EQUITABLE DISBURSEMENT OF RESOURCES OUR POLICIES AND PROGRAMS ARE CREATED AND ADMINISTERED TO IDENTIFY AND AVOID DISCRIMINATION AND BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO FUNDING. AND TO AVOID DESPITE. THE HIGH AND ADVERSE EFFECTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THIS IS ABOUT OR PRACTICE. AND OUR BELIEF. FINALLY I KNOW THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT REPORT WE APPROPRIATION OF MONEY AND SPECIFICALLY CAN WE MANAGE THESE BONDS. AND GET THEM OUT THE DOOR IONIC BRIEFLY TALK MORE ABOUT THE RE APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND ARE IMPLEMENTING SYSTEM TWICE AND STOP HIRING. ASSEMBLY DISPERSED THIS MONEY THAT REPORTED. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE ARTS COUNCIL DOES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ABSORB THE PROPOSED WORKLOADS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WORKING CULTURAL DISTRICTS WILL ALLOW US TO HIRE A LIMITED STAFF PERSON WILL CLOSELY WORK WITH ME AND CALIFORNIA POET LAUREATE AND YOUTH. PROGRAM ONE ABLE TO HIRE A PERMANENT STAFF PERSON TO SUPPORT THE USE DISBURSING OF THESE FUNDS. AGAIN I KNOW I'M NEW AND I HAVE A LOT TO LEARN. BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE LISTENING COMMUNICATING AND BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS. I SO CAN MAKE GOOD ON THE GOVERNOR'S AND MONUMENT TO GET MONEY AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND IS BACK WITH. US OF COURSE THE ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MOSCONI AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW POSITION WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THE TIER FROM THE L. A. L. OF FIRST. YES COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED RE APPROPRIATION- BUT SIMILAR TO THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOTED BY YOUR STAFF IN THE AGENDA. IT DOES RAISE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ARTS COUNCIL'S ABILITY TO GET THESE GRANT DOLLARS OUT AND THE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN PROVIDED PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME INFUSIONS OF GRANT FUNDS. AND THE N. AT THE ARTS COUNCIL CAN BE KIND OF FEAST OR FAMINE DEPENDING ON THE STATE'S BUDGET CONDITION THAT. SO THEY'VE HAD BASIC CAN'T ONE TIME INFUSIONS AS WAS MENTIONED- AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION pFINDS AND OTHER PROPOSED- NOT I DON'T THINK ON THIS AGENDA BUT REFERENCED AND- FOR NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE CULTURAL DISTRICTS PROGRAM AND SO IT JUST RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT DOES THE ARTS COUNCIL HAVE THE RESOURCES. NECESSARY I BELIEVE THAT DIRECTOR MENTIONED THAT THERE WOULD BE- MAYBE STAFF POSITIONS THAT GO ALONG AT THE CULTURAL DISTRICTS PROPOSAL IS- APPROVED. I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THAT ONE IN FRONT OF ME BECAUSE THAT ONE'S NOT ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY BUT I DON'T RECALL THAT BEING PART OF THE PROPOSAL AND% SAID THAT MIGHT JUST BE SOMETHING. FOR THE COMMITTEE TO. TAKE THESE AS UNDER CONSIDERATION AS A- IT'S ONE TIME. THEY HAVE A CLOSE ON REESE AND IS THAT PHYSICIANS REALLY INCLUDE IN THE PROPOSAL AND PERHAPS FINANCE CAN WEIGH IN ON THAT. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED APARNA FINANCE. HI TIM WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN CLARIFY THAT POINT- THE COLLEGE BOWL HAS UP 21% ABLE FOR ADMIN SAID ARTS COUNCIL APPOINTED MINISTER THE ESTABLISH A POSITION. BUT I THINK I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT. YEAH THE PROPOSAL HAS UP 21% AVAILABLE FOR ADMIN COSTS FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL AS FOR THE- BUDGET PROPOSAL. IS ANTICIPATED ESTABLISH A POSITION NOT IS NOT ACTUAL POSITIONS WITH US. ALSO THAT MAKES SENSE. AND I THINK I'M HAVING A HARD TIME JUST SOME UNDERSTANDING YOU THROUGH YOUR MASK MY APOLOGIES DO QUICKLY SAID HELLO- THE DISTRICT PROPOSAL AS UP 21% AVAILABLE FOR ADMIN COSTS IN SO THE ARTS COUNCIL PLANNING TO WITH THAT UP OF ESTABLISHED. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE DIRECTORS MENTION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. YEAH I JUST I AM- FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CANNOT ESTABLISH BECAUSE- THAT ARE APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE USING THIS PROCESS TO ADMINISTRATIVELY ESTABLISHED POSITIONS. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. IT'S KNOWN THAT THOSE POSITIONS ARE NEEDED TO GO WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE YOU. AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WAY AND ON. WHAT WHAT SORT OF SUPPORT IS NEEDED AND WHAT TYPE OF POSITION AND HOW MUCH AND CLASSIFICATIONS AND ALL THAT. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DEFER ABOUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION THE WAY THAT THE PRO PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. AGAIN THAT'S ACTUALLY A- ONE OF MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION SO MUCH APPRECIATED DEPART OF FINANCE THAT YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD ON THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED. THAT'S MISTER IS GONNA YOU MENTIONED THAT- SOMEONE ON YOUR ON YOUR TEAM I BELIEVE- MISTER BERRY WAS ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS RELATED TO STAFF. SO GIVEN THE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT. ON THIS PROPOSAL. THEREIS CONCERN AS YOU'VE HEARD IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT- THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER SUCH A LARGE SCALE PROGRAM. SO CAN YOU SPEAK ON THAT. AMOUNT OF PARTICULAR CONCERN. I AND I WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO TAKE UP ARMS SURE YEAH I THINK WHAT- WHAT I'M DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES. IS SHARED IS WHAT WE HOPE TO HAPPEN IS THAT WITH THE WITH THE ADDITIONAL OR WITH THE ABILITY TO TAKE 1% OF THE FUNDS. OR CULTURAL DISTRICTS TO ESTABLISH A POSITION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A MANAGER POSITION- IN ORDER TO MANAGE OVER FOUR GRAND AND WE HAVE. VERY MAKING SOME. THIS TO RUN OUR REGULAR GRANT PROGRAMS AND THAT MANAGER WOULD BE ABLE TO AND WE CAN GET SOME LIMITED TERM AGING HERE IS THAT WOULD BE DOING THE PROGRAM AND THAT MANAGER WOULD BE HELPING TO DISTRICT. I FEEL LIKE WITH OUR CURRENT STAFFING PLAN ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE ARE FILLING MORE VACANCIES AND BUILDING A RESTORING OUR CAPACITY TO RUN OUR REGULAR GRANT PROGRAMS AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE COMING UP. ESPECIALLY WITH THAT 1% WE WOULD BE FINE. THANK YOU APPRECIATED- I KNOW THAT THIS S A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS AND- AS WE WELCOME MR MOSCONI AND HIS LISTENING TOUR ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE RECOMMENDED PERHAPS TO THE PREVIOUS HEARINGS WERE WE WENT QUITE INTO SOME DEPTH OVER THIS. IN ADDITION. OF STAFF NOTED THERE HAVE BEEN NO EXPENDITURES FOR SOME OF THESE FUNDS HAS SINCE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY APPROPRIATED. COULD- THE C. A. C. EXPLAIN WHY THESE LOCAL. PROGRAMS DOLLARS HAVEN'T OPENED. YEAH I CAN TAKE THAT IF THAT'S OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO THE- IN TWENTY TWENTY JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THE CCNP ANTICIPATED THAT DUTY GRANT PROCESSING DELAYS. AND IMPACT YOUR GRANT APPLICATION ORGANIZATIONS WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ENCUMBER APPROXIMATELY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT INCLUDED TWO SPECIAL FUNDS ARE ARTS LICENSE PLATE ZERO ZERO SEVEN EIGHT AND ARE A KEY PART BECAUSE SCHOOLS FUNDS WHICH ARE BOTH FUNDS THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY COUNT ON EVERY MONTH BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THOSE ARE REVENUES THAT COME AND- WE'RE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHAT THOSE REVENUES ARE SO WE GENERALLY TEND. TO LEAVE THE TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR TO ACTUALLY ENCUMBER AND EXPENSE BUT WHEN WE REALIZED THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE THERE BECAUSE OF THE LABOR GOING TO HAVE THIS MONEY ON THE TABLE WE DID ASK FOR A PC P. AND AN EXTENSION OF OUR CUPBOARDS PERIOD. WHILE WAITING FOR THAT APPROVAL- THEY CAME A LITTLE BIT LATER WE NEEDED TO START OPENING OUR DOORS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GRANT SEASON AND STARTED USING. TWENTY TWENTY ONE FUNDS. BECAUSE GRANT. ONLY INTENT TO USE ALL OF THE TWENTY OUR RECORD TIME AND OF COURSE WITH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WERE STILL SOME DELAYS SO WE ARE PLANNING ON SPENDING ALL OF TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE FUNDING IN OUR CURRENT GRANT- PORTFOLIO THAT TO FOURTEEN GRANT PROGRAMS- THAT WILL BE ABOUT- SIXTEEN WORKING GRANTS PROGRAM AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXPAND ALL OF THE FRIENDS AND SO ARE NEW AT THIS PROPOSAL. IS TO ALLOW US THE TIME TO GET ALL OF THOSE INTO CONTRACTING COVER THOSE FUNDS- AND THEN WE'RE ASKING FOR EIGHT CONTINUOUS OR IN TWO YEARS TO UNCOVER ALL OF OUR PLANS MOVING FORWARD SINCE WE STARTED WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PRESIDENT BUSH SERVICES WE FOUND THAT OTHER GRANT MAKING AGENCIES AT THE STATE. WITH MORE THAN ONE YEAR TO ENCUMBER THE YEARS AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE PROPOSED RIGHT NOW FEEL LIKE THAT. WESENTLICH JUST TO HAVE IT TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH SOME IMPACTS EITHER- ANY CHANGES IN THE IN OUR GRANT MAKING. I'M TIMELINE THAT MIGHT IMPACT OUR GRANT MAKING PROCESS. IT IS NOT REALLY A MATTER OF CAPACITY IT'S A MATTER OF HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY JUST LIKE OTHER AGENCIES DO WITH THE STATE. THAT'S ONE CHANGE WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO. AND THEN- WE WILL BE LOOKING TO WE'RE RECRUITING ALL OF OUR VACANCIES AND FILLING OUR VACANCIES. AND SO WE FILLED EIGHT VACANCIES SO FAR AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO FILL ALL OF THEM WE ARE- ADDING MORE STAFF IN OUR OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT. DEDICATED TO GRANTS MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING AND PROCUREMENT. AND WE WILL BE LOOKING INTO A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF OUR SPECIAL FUNDS THE LICENSE PLATE FUNDS AND THE- AND KEEP RECORDS SCHOOLS WE STARTED A CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL BE. MOVING TO SECURE THAT IF THAT'S A POSSIBILITY FOR US SO THAT WE'RE NOT. IN THAT SITUATION AGAIN WHERE WE. DON'T WHAT WE HAVE TO EXCEED OUR INCUMBENTS. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED- AND ONE THING THAT I WOULD NOT I THINK WE DISCUSSED IN OUR LAST HEARING WAS AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TURN IN SOME OF THOSE. GRANT AWARDEES OVER TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE WOULD KNOW WHICH PROGRAMS. WHICH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FUNDED LOCALLY NOT ON A COUNTY LEVEL BUT MORE LOCALLY SPECIFICALLY SPECIFICALLY TO MEMBERS DISTRICTS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S STILL ON YOUR RADAR. ABSOLUTELY OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE A AND AGAIN MR MOSCONI WELCOME. TO YOUR NEW POSITION AND WE LOOK FORWARD. TO WORKING. I THINK FOR THE INFORMATION THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD A THIS ITEM OPEN FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON. TO ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN. THANK YOU FOR THIS ITEM- HERE THREE ISSUES FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE CRUISING INCLUDED THE SPRING FINANCE LETTERS. THAT'S BECAUSE ELECTIONS. VOTER HOTLINE STAFFING. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME FORWARD TO DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL MY NAME IS JANET LEAN AND SHE FOR THE ELECTIONS DIVISION FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS SEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND GENERAL FUND MONEY AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ANNUALLY THERE AFTER. FOR THE USE OF TEMPORARY STAFF TO ASSIST WITH THE STATEWIDE ELECTION VOTER SUPPORT ON THE SOS. THE SECRETARY. LINE SERVICES ONE OF THE SECRETARIES PUBLIC FACING RESOURCES AND AS A WAY FOR OFFICE TO CONVEY TRUSTED INFORMATION TO VOTERS. AND SHE- COULD STAFFING MAINTAINS A SECOND. D. TO QUICKLY TRIAGE DOCUMENT REPORT AND RESOLVE ISSUES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE ELECTION LAWS ARE FOLLOWED AND THAT EVERY VOTER HAS THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED. TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE THE SECRETARY STATE HAS HONEST A SAW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PHONE CALLS AND REQUESTS FROM VOTERS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND THE NOVEMBER ELECTION WE SAW A HUGE SURGE. IN THE LAST FEW ELECTIONS WE'VE ALSO CHANSEN AN INCREASE OF INTEREST IN ALL THINGS ELECTION RELATED. SO AS THE STATE FULLY TRANSITIONS TO AN ALL ACTIVE VOTER OF ALL ACTIVE VOTERS BEING MALE THEY'VE OPEN MAIL BALLOT WE ANTICIPATE AN EVEN LARGER NUMBER OF VOTERS REACHING OUT TO OUR OFFICE FOR INFORMATION AND EVEN EARLIER IN THE ELECTION TIMELINE. SO A GENERALLY THE CALL VOLUME- ARE MOST OFTEN AFFECTED BY THE INTEREST OF PARTICIPATION FOR VOTERS. TYPICALLY PARTICIPATION IS HIGHER DURING GENERAL ELECTION YEARS. AND WE ANTICIPATE THE INCREASE OF FOUR OF A PARTICULAR BALLOT MEASURE OR CANDIDATE ON THE BALLOT. DRIVES PARTICULAR- NEED FOR OUR OFFICE TO SUPPORT VOTERS THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS SOME FOLKS KNOW. AND GOOD OR BAD A SOCIAL MEDIA THE DISCUSSIONS PROVIDE A PROVIDE- THAT VOTERS TO HAVE INTEREST IN THE RESULTS IN COLOR OFFICE TO ASK ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. IN ADDITION WITH THE VOTING RULES CHANGES AND METHODS CHANGE CALLS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THEIR FOR REQUESTING THIS ADDITIONAL STAFFING FUNDING FOR THIS TEMPORARY WORKERS TO HELP ASSIST ON OUR VOTER ASSISTANCE HOTLINE. THANK YOU. L. L. C. FINANCE. IT AND WEBER PART OF FINANCE NOTITIA COMMENTS LOL. WE HAVE NO CONCERNS. QUICK QUESTION HEALTH PANDEMIC IMPACTED VOLUME OF CALLS TO THE VOTER HOTLINE AS CALIFORNIA TRANSITIONS TO THE ENDEMIC FACE NOW IS THIS SECRETARY OF STATE AT PROJECTIONS ON THE ANTICIPATED VOLUME OF CALLS THE HOTLINE FOR THE- NATION'S. D. A PANDEMIC WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CALLS AS FOLKS ARE I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHERE THEY'RE VOTING OPPORTUNITIES ARE AS WE TRANSITION TO ALL MAIL BALLOT ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA FOLKS REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THEIR RIGHTS WERE AND SO THEY WERE A LITTLE CONFUSED ON. WENTZ AND SO DURING THE MID SEXUALLY SAW QUITE A FEW QUITE A FEW A SIGNIFICANT ACTUALLY INCREASE AND CALLS. I BELIEVE AS WE ANTICIPATE GOING INTO THIS NEXT PHASE WE WILL STILL HAVE THESE ANTICIPATED CALLS WE ANTICIPATE SAID- RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CALLS. BECAUSE WE'VE TRANSITION TO AN ALL MAIL BALLOT ELECTION WITH VOTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS TO UTILIZE AND SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT IS STILL BE GREAT- I THINK AS FOLKS KNOW ELECTIONS ARE NOT A ONE TIME A YEAR OR TWO. THE PROCESS EVERY IS INTERESTED ME IN ELECTIONS AND THE OUTCOME AND SO THEREFORE WE ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CALLS. WHAT OTHER FACTORS DR CALL WILLIAM. WHAT'S ON THE BALLOT THE CONTEST SPECIFICALLY BALLOT MEASURES AND OR CANDIDATESAND I BELIEVE THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WHEN WE GET A HUGE VOLUME WHENEVER WE GET A NEWS STORY WHENEVER THERE'S A DEBATE. WHEN EVER THERE IS OF ANY INTEREST IN SOCIAL MEDIA IS WHEN WE SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CALLS. THANK YOU WHEN WILL THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS VOTER CHOICE ACT RESOURCES. PLEASE PROCEED.

AS WELL AS- BOOK BY MAIL BALLOT BE MAILED WE ALSO HAVE ABOUT THE PUBLICATIONS BEING- AT THAT SET AROUND THE WHOLE DIFFERENT- COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE- MORE OF BBM BALLOTS EMAIL BY DROP BOX LOCATIONS. AND SO- THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN FROM FIVE COUNTIES TO TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN TWENTY TWENTY TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A SIXTEEN MILLION VOTERS VOTING UNDER THIS NEW MODEL- AND SO IT'S- REALLY IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE A MEANS OF HELPING COUNTIES TO TRANSACTION AND USHER IN THIS NEW EDUCATION MODEL FOR VOTERS. I'M WITHOUT IT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT I'M VOTERS WOULD NOT BE AWARE OF ALL THEIR OPTIONS FOR BOATING. AND SOME MIGHT MISS OUT. THE QUITE FRANKLY- WE START OFF WITH JUST THREE POSITIONS- BACK INTO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR FIVE COUNTIES IF YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT WITH TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES NOW WE WOULD NEED. SIGNIFICANT MORE STAFF NOW WE'RE ONLY ASKING FOR THREE TODAY BECAUSE WE THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN STRETCHING AND TRY TO MAKE IT WORK WITH SUCH AS FAR AS WE COULD POSSIBLY GO. POINT AND SO WE WOULD NEED TO DO SOME POSITIONS. AND WEBER TO FIND ITS NO ADDITIONAL. L. L. WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS ITEM. THANK YOU.
