FACT THAT THIS IS CLEARLY AN

ACTUAL OCCURRENCE MAKES A

00:58:58.434 --> 00:58:59.636
COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM WHAT

A FEW EXAMPLE OF HOW.

00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:34.637
OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.639
PROPOSING IS -- CURRENTLY

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:38.274
DIFFERENT -- THAN WHAT WE HAVE

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:39.309
ON THE BOOK.

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:41.077
YES THIS WOULD MAKE IT A FELONY

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:42.979
RATHER THAN A MISDEMEANOR AND

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.781
THE SHOOTER IN OUR CASE -- IF

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:46.182

OFFENDER WOULD HAVE HAD NO REAL --

00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:51.754
SUPERVISION OR TEETH TO THE TO

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:54.490
THE LAW ALL THIS PARTICULAR

JUVENILE HE WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD.

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:04.100

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:07.303
PROSECUTING HIM AS A MISDEMEANOR

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.705
WHICH WOULD REALLY IT THE

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.173
PUNISHMENT DID NOT FIT THE CRIME

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:11.874
OR HIS RECORD NOW WE WOULD TAKE.

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.409
EVERY INDIVIDUAL ON A CASE BY

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:14.978
CASE BASIS IF IT WAS A YOUNG

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.080
PERSON AND THAT KIND I THINK WE

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:17.613
CAN HANDLE THE CASE IS A

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.082
MISDEMEANOR.

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:19.649
BUT THAT'S HOW IT WOULD BE

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:22.719
DIFFERENT -- BUT WE WOULD HAVE A

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.020
FELONY PROBATION OFFICER.

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:25.722
OF SUPERVISING THE TREATMENT OF

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.357
THIS INDIVIDUAL IF THEY HAD DRUG

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:28.992
PROBLEMS IF THEY HAD MENTAL

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:30.860
HEALTH ISSUES OR IF THEY JUST

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.695
LIKE TO COMMIT CRIMES IN THIS

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:34.364
PARTICULAR INSTANCE.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.699
THE FENDER PRETENDED HE WAS A

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.101
POLICE OFFICER.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.603
AND WHEN THE POLICE CAME HE

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.373
PRETENDED THAT HE WAS A POLICE

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:44.774
OFFICER WAS TRYING TO HELP

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.909
PEOPLE EVEN DETAINED PEOPLE SO

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:50.013
SUCH A SERIOUS SERIOUS SITUATION.

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:52.048
THAT -- MISDEMEANOR PUNISHMENT

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:58.221
JUSTICE NOT FIT THE CRIME UNDER

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:00.056
SOME CIRCUMSTANCES [inaudible]

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.991
PARKING.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.893
ISN'T IT A SEPARATE CRIME 10% OF

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.527
POLICE OFFICERS WAS AND THAT'S

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:05.194
HOW WE WERE ABLE TO GET A FELONY

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:05.828
CONVICTION IN THIS CASE BECAUSE

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:06.429
OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:07.730
TREATED AS A MISDEMEANOR.

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.265
THAT IS HOW WE WERE ABLE BECAUSE

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.300
OF THAT CRIME WERE ABLE TO DO

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.635
THAT BUT NOT ALL.

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:14.237
ACTIVE SHOOTERS PRETEND THEY'RE

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:15.471
POLICE OFFICERS.

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:16.472
RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU WERE TRYING

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.440
TO ELEVATE THE CRIME THAT YOU'RE

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.708
DISCUSSING YOU'RE USING HIS

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:19.642
IMPERSONATION OF A POLICE

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:20.810
OFFICER WHICH IS A SEPARATE

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:21.978
CRIME WHICH DOES RIGHTS A LEVEL

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.479
OF FELONY SO.

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:25.014
I DON'T THINK OVERLAPPING THIS

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.549
THAT ON TOP OF THIS CRIME IS

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:27.450
APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT THAT

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:28.384
CRIME HAS THE APPROPRIATE

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:30.153
PUNISHMENT BUT HE DIDN'T DO THAT

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.921
IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.322
THREE HE ONLY DID THAT AND ONE

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:34.957
OF THE FIRST TWO HE JUST CALLED

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.626
IN A FALSE REPORT OF AN ACTIVE.

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:37.827
SHOOTER WHICH SHUT DOWN THE

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:39.862
HOSPITAL ITSELF AND HE WAS ABLE

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.397
TO GAIN THE POLICE OFFICER

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.833
INTELLIGENCE EACH TIME BY

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.001
WATCHING.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.369
THE HOSPITAL BY MAKING THESE

01:01:57.647 --> 01:01:58.981

FONG AND RIGHT THERE ALREADY WE

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:04.587
ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:07.957
TO EMERGENCY SERVICES THEIR

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:13.129
OTHER STATUTES THAT RATES THAT

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:14.297
THERE IS THE DETERRENCE OF THOSE.

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:15.098
WHAT ARE I'M SURE EXTREME COSTS

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:15.665
IN THE CASE THAT ARE BEING

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:16.199
DESCRIBED HERE FROM THE

CIVIL AND AND AND RECORD THE

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.474
COST I THINK THE THE CRUX OF

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.109
THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE.

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.544
THAT IF THERE IS A HOAX OR A

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:29.846
FALSE ACTIVE SHOOTER THAT THERE

SO WHEN WE CAN WORK OUT THE THE

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:38.121
REIMBURSEMENT SIDE BUT THE CRUX

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:40.356
OF THE BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.491
THERE IS SOMEHOW.

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:43.926
THE ABILITY TO HAVE -- SOME

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:46.295
FLEXIBILITY AND TO ENSURE THAT

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.397
THAT PERSON IS A CAN BE TRIED

THOUSAND FOURTEEN CáC.

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.258
TO OPPOSED OUR BILL.

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.961
OR THE BILLS THAT WERE OUT AND

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:34.430
UNFORTUNATELY NOW THEY'RE PART

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:36.832
OF CAL ANIMAL WHICH IS MERGED

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.133
AND THAT THERE.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.203
THIS IS -- A ONE SIDED DEAL.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.339
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING OF

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:44.673
TELLING THE EMPLOYER WHERE YOU

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.575

ONLY OFFER IT FOR A LONG FOR

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:56.251
SMITH AND BY THE WAY.

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:57.886
ROY MARKHAM WAS MY SON.

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.722
I AM AS A MOTHER.

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.490
AND THAT'S FOR ONE REASON WHY --

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.225
OPPOSING THIS BILL BECAUSE IT

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:06.462
DOES NOT GIVE THE EMPLOYEE.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.330
THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING THEIR

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:11.767
TRAINING PAID FOR AS IT SHOULD

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:13.035
BE ARE YOU HI.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.570
AT A RESTAURANT TODAY I ASKED

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:15.404
THE LADY.

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:16.939
WHO THAT WAS SERVING US DO YOU

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:19.274
HAVE TRAINING FOR YOUR JOB YEAH

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.577
SHE HAS TRAINING FOR HER JOB

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:23.879
WHERE IN THE JOB ALLOWS IT TH

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.215
THE EMPLOYER PAYS FOR IT?

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:28.083
SHE HAS AT LEAST ONE TRAINING

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.284
OUT OF A YEAR.

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:32.021
IF IT REQUIRES MORE TRAINING AND

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:33.389
SHE GETS IT.

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:34.923
AND THE EMPLOYER TRAINS IT IT

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.825
BENEFITS THE EMPLOYER AND THE

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:40.529
EMPLOYEE AND IT DOES NOT COME

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:41.664
OUT OF HER POCKET.

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:42.564
IF MY SON HAD TO PAY FOR THIS

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.000
TRAINING HE HAD A FAMILY HE

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.102
COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:50.105
THEREFORE IF HE HAD THE MONEY TO

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:51.540
PAY FOR A BULLET PROOF VEST HE

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:54.176
WOULD HAVE DONE IT.

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:56.712
AFTER HIS DEATH BULLET PROOF

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:58.847
VESTS WERE PROVIDED.

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:01.083
AND THAT WAS A HINDSIGHT.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.452
AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL IF IT WAS

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:04.053
WRITTEN IN A DIFFERENT I WOULD

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:08.757
OF ALL WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPROVE IT.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.059
BECAUSE I SEE THIS BEYOND A

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:11.460
CHAIN EFFECT.

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.662
OF ITS EMPLOYEES HAVE TO PAY FOR

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.464
THEIR OWN TRAINING YOU'RE GOING

01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:17.633
TO HAVE.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.901
OFFICERS OUT THERE DOING.

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.235
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE?

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:21.870
DOING SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE TO

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:24.406
HAVE AN OFFICER OUT THERE DOING

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.241
ANIMAL CONTROL TRAINING.

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:28.911
IN PROVIDING FOR ANIMAL CONTROL.

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:31.714
AT WHICH SOME OFFICERS DO BUT

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.548
THE THING OF IT IS YOU CAN HAVE

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.950
MORE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN ANIMAL

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:37.052
CONTROL OFFICE THAT DOES A SEALS

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.153
ONLY.

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.588
THEY'RE GOING TO BE QUITTING

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:40.622
THEIR JOBS ARE GOING TO GO INTO

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.990
MORE ELSE OR SOMEBODY ELSE CAN

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:43.592
PROVIDE YOUR TRAINING WHERE THEY

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:44.393
DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT OUT OF

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.095
POCKET BECAUSE IT BENEFITS THE

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.029
AGENCY.

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:53.435
NOT THE EMPLOYEE THANK YOU MA'AM.

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.903
ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:58.974
OPPOSITION.

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.809
YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE IF YOU WANT

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.044

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.082
OPPOSITION OF THE BILL SIMPLY I

AGREE FOR THE TRAINING.

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:10.185
BUT I BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:12.488
WRITTEN DIFFERENTLY HONESTLY --

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:15.591
CALIFORNIA AND ANIMALS IS --

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:17.426
JOINED TOGETHER BY A CAPTAIN

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:21.663
JACK THEY'VE COME TOGETHER -- AB

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:22.765
ONE ELEVEN TWELVE IS UNFAIR

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.333
LABOR PRACTICES PRIMARILY

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:25.968
BECAUSE THE ONLY PERSON THAT

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:28.003
WOULD BE PROVIDING THE TRAINING

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.905
FOR THE ACO IS WOULD BE KELL

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:32.541
ANIMALS THERE ARE VERY FEW LAW

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.009
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.310
COLLEGES THE COLLEGES OR

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.279
UNIVERSITIES THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:38.514
FOR ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.883
COURSES SO THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE.

01:13:40.949 --> 01:13:45.254
THE OPTION TO GO THROUGH CAL

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.756
ANIMALS -- THAT'S A MONOPOLY

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:48.423
RIGHT THERE IF YOU'RE FORCED TO

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:49.091
PAY OUT OF POCKET AND TAKE YOUR

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.492
OWN TIME TO GO DO THE TRAINING

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:51.360
FOR YOUR JOB.

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:54.396
WE ONLY HAVE ONE PLACE TO GO --

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.564
TO THAT'S NOT FAIR.

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:57.266
AND THERE ARE DIFFERENCES

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:58.667
BETWEEN ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:00.202
WHO ENFORCE LOCAL ORDINANCES AND

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.703
STATE LAWS AND THE HUMANE

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.205
OFFICERS TO ENFORCE ONLY

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.706
SPECIFIC STATE LAWS.

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.875
BUT CALIFORNIA ANIMALS WANTS TO

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.011
DO A STANDARDIZED TRAINING AND

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.612
IT DOES NOT FIT -- IN SIMPLE

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.614
TERMS BOTH HUMANE OFFICERS AN

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:14.550
ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS AND FOR

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.451
STATE LAWS THAT PROTECT ANIMALS

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:18.587
FROM HARM BY PEOPLE BUT HUMANE

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:20.189
OFFICERS DO NOT ENFORCE STATE OR

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:22.658
LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL ORDINANCES.

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:23.959
AND SECONDLY ANIMAL CONTROL

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:25.727
OFFICERS AND FOR STATE AND LOCAL

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.496
LAWS THAT PROTECT PEOPLE AND

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:29.331
PETS AND ANIMALS FROM HARM BY

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:30.365
ANIMALS.

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:31.867
THE TWENTY TO FORTY OUR INITIAL

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.268
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR ANIMAL

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.370
CONTROL OFFICERS ARE IDENTICAL

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.872
TO THOSE OF A HUMANE OFFICERS

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:39.942
BUT HAVE A LITTLE TO DO WITH THE

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:41.009
ACO IS WORK YOU [inaudible]

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:42.377
THANK [inaudible]

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:45.247
AT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

BAUER-KAHAN MR COOLEY WE ADDRESS

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.188
THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:54.556
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:56.658
OF POCKET THERE'S ONLY ONE

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:57.159
PROVIDER WHICH COULD BE

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:57.459
[inaudible]

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:59.094
CONCERNING.

NOT BE DELIGHTED TO SPEAK

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:04.399
BRIEFLY TO THAT -- I THINK THIS

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:06.001
BILL WILL ACTUALLY SET STANDARDS

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.502
FOR THIS [inaudible]

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.037
FIELD.

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:11.039
AS YOU DO THAT OTHERS WILL FIND

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:12.674
WAYS TO PROVIDE TRAINING I THINK

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:13.442
IT IS.

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:16.078
THIS BILL CHANGES THE

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:16.678
ENVIRONMENT WAS TRAINING WILL

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:21.183
HAPPEN -- THIS TYPE OF BILL

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.885
ACTUALLY RAISES THE BAR ON THE

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:24.453
UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:25.754
IF THEY HAVE A PROFESSIONAL

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:27.189
OPERATION THEY'RE HARM

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.490
PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:29.358
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KIND OF

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:30.859
MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION OF

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:31.727
RAISING YOUR OWN INTERNAL

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:32.394
STANDARDS.

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.763
SO THIS THIS APPROACH WHERE YOU

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:37.733

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.001

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:52.281
SO THAT THEY THEY WANT TO TRAIN

AND I DO WANT TO NOTE ACTUALLY

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:23.225
THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS OF RAISED A

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:24.693
HAVE NOTED THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:25.794
PROVISIONAL LAW.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:26.661
THAT HAVE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.096
FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE A HEIGHTENED

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:30.098

WHICH THEY REGARD AS VERY

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:34.503
SUPPORTIVE OF THE OUTCOME.

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:35.670
SO I DO NOT HAVE THAT

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:37.372
CONFIDENTIALITY AMENDMENT TODAY

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.440

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:01.863
THESE AGENCIES.

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:04.266

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:23.251
IS SO IMPORTANT FOR KIDS I THINK

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.287

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.636
THE OF THE SHOOTING IN SANTA

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:24.705
MONICA THE TERRIBLE ONE RANCH

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:26.974
ATTAIN TO HIM -- AND I'M SURE

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:28.442
THERE ARE MANY MORE.

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:30.978
MY OWN PERSONAL -- CONNECTION

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:33.347
WITH THIS ISSUE IS WHEN THAT

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:35.950
PERSON WHO CAME TO INSTALL A NEW

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:37.685
INTERNET SERVICE IN OUR HOUSE

01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:39.253
AND HE ALSO HAS A MACHINE SHOP.

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.722
AND AS A DRILL PRESS AND HE TOLD

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:43.123
US MY HUSBAND ME THAT.

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:45.092
ALL THE TIME PEOPLE COME WITH

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:46.694
HER I'M FINISH RECEIVER TO HIS

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.163
SHOP AND ASK HIM TO COMPLY TO

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.599
DRILL THE THE REQUIRED HOLES TO

01:37:51.665 --> 01:37:53.801
TURN IT INTO A COMPLETE RECEIVER

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:56.136
THIS IS A PROBLEM -- AS YOU KNOW

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:57.771
THE LEGISLATURE TRIED TO ADDRESS

01:37:57.838 --> 01:38:00.040
THIS ISSUE WITH A. B. A FIVE

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:01.542
SEVEN IN.

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:02.042
TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE WHICH

01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:03.544
REQUIRES ANYONE WHO HAS

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:05.412
MANUFACTURED OR SOME OF THE

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:07.581
FIREARM TO GET A SERIAL NUMBER

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:09.016
FROM THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:10.884
ALONG WITH THAT THERE WOULD BE A

01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:12.186
BACKGROUND CHECK AND RECORD.

01:38:12.253 --> 01:38:14.922
THIS BILL GOES FURTHER TO TRY

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:17.825
AND PREVENT -- ACQUISITION OF

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:19.660
THESE PARTS BY PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:22.696
PROHIBITED IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:23.797
THAT IS FAR BETTER.

01:38:23.864 --> 01:38:26.200
THIS IS NARROWER THAN LAST

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:26.800
YEAR'S VERSION I KNOW THERE'S

01:38:26.867 --> 01:38:28.502
CONCERN ABOUT HOW DO YOU DEFINE

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:29.837
ALL THESE PARTS AND ARE WE

01:38:29.903 --> 01:38:31.372
CONCLUDING SPRINGS AND OTHER

01:38:31.438 --> 01:38:34.408
THINGS -- SO THIS REALLY --

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:36.076
FOCUSES ON THE KEY ELEMENTS

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.478
WHICH IS THE ON FINISH FRAME AND

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:39.346
RECEIVER WHICH IS WHAT IT SHOULD

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:41.982
DO AND IT SETS UP A SYSTEM WHERE

01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:42.916
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO TO A

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:44.251
PRECURSOR PART FENDER. TO

THAT YOU'RE NOT PROHIBITED

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:52.226
BEFORE YOU ACQUIRE AND THAT IS

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:53.994
OUR GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.596
PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED.

01:38:55.663 --> 01:38:56.864
DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.499
CONDITION OR PAST HISTORY AND

01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:00.668

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:07.841
INSTEAD THEY CAN MAKE THEIR I IN

CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:56.156
COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DâN RE

WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.026
WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:01.028
I THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXPAND ON

01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:03.230
THE THE EXAM AMMUNITION SYSTEM

01:40:03.297 --> 01:40:03.831
THAT WE CAN USE FOR BACKGROUND

01:40:03.897 --> 01:40:04.798
CHECKS I WAS.

01:40:04.865 --> 01:40:05.833
PASSED THROUGH INITIATIVE IN

01:40:05.899 --> 01:40:08.569
STATUTE A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:09.470
STILL ACTUALLY HAVE.

01:40:09.536 --> 01:40:10.170
DON'T HAVE FINAL RAGS ON THAT WE

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:11.338
DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:12.106
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:13.407
EMPLOYMENT UNTIL JULY FIRST OF

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:14.241
THIS YEAR.

01:40:14.308 --> 01:40:15.209
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:16.276
QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THAT

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:18.178
SYSTEM IN IN THIS SEEKS TO

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:20.013
EXPAND ON THAT SYSTEM TO RUN A

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:21.915
BACKGROUND CHECK PORTION -- AND

01:40:21.982 --> 01:40:23.016
THERE'S SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS

01:40:23.083 --> 01:40:24.952
ON ON HOW APPS CAN BE USED

01:40:25.018 --> 01:40:26.220
BECAUSE OF BIG GETTING TIED INTO

01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:27.588
THE NEXT SYSTEM AND SO -- I

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:28.689
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:30.090
REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AND

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:31.892
AND I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:33.494
EXPAND A SYSTEM THAT.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.095
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK --

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:36.663
FURTHER THIS BILLS INCREDIBLY

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:39.133
VAGUE -- I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:39.666
TIGHTENED SINCE THE LAST

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:42.236
ITERATION -- BUT IT'S STILL BEGS

01:40:42.302 --> 01:40:43.637
THE QUESTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:44.238
SOMETHING LIKE AN UNFINISHED

01:40:44.304 --> 01:40:46.140
FRAME AT WHAT POINT DOES A HUNK

01:40:46.206 --> 01:40:48.075
OF METAL.

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:49.877
BECOME A FRIEND OR AN ON FINISH

01:40:49.943 --> 01:40:51.612
FRAME HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:54.281
DISTINGUISH THAT -- YOU KNOW

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:55.916
WHAT I WHAT POINT IS A BLOCK AND

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:57.618
A GOING TO FALL UNDER THIS IN

01:40:57.684 --> 01:40:58.685
AND HOW IS LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:40:58.752 --> 01:41:00.287
EXACTLY SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE THIS

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:01.488
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PARTS OF

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:02.356
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY DON'T

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:03.490
HAVE UNIQUE SERIAL NUMBERS HOW

01:41:03.557 --> 01:41:04.792
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL WHETHER

01:41:04.858 --> 01:41:05.692
WAS PURCHASED.

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:09.329
AND TWO THOUSAND THREE OR TWO

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:09.930
THOUSAND NINETEEN I THINK IT

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:10.597
BECOMES AN ENFORCEMENT NIGHTMARE

01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:13.033
ALSO THESE ARE PARTS OF THE GUN

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:14.635
SO IS LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPOSED

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:15.302
TO TAKE APART THE GUN OR THEY'RE

01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:15.502
JUST.

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:17.871
EXPECTING TOUGH TO FIND SOMEONE

01:41:17.938 --> 01:41:19.373
WITH THE A COUPLE OF THESE

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.941
LAYING AROUND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:23.544
LOOK AT FIRE ARMS -- DID THE

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:25.579
ACTUAL FRAME DID IS DETERMINED

01:41:25.646 --> 01:41:26.814
TO BE THE FIREARM AND THAT'S

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.981
WHERE THE UNIQUE NUMBER IS

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:29.016
THAT'S WORTH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:31.084
THE SERIAL NUMBER -- AND SO

01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:33.287
THERE IS A WAY -- TO TO TRACK

01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:35.789
THAT -- AND SO I JUST THINK THIS

01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:36.924
IS GOING TO BE IN IT FOR SMITH

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:38.358
NIGHTMARE -- I THINK THIS IS

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:40.794
UNNECESSARY AND ALSO WHAT IS

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:41.728
SOMEONE SUPPOSED TO DO IF

01:41:41.795 --> 01:41:42.996
THEY'RE OUT OF STATE LET'S SAY

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:43.831
YOU'RE OUT OF STATE AND YOU HAVE

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:45.332
A FARM THAT BREAKS DOWN YOU NEED

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:48.068
TO BUY A PART. TWO TO MAKE IT --

01:41:48.135 --> 01:41:50.237
COMPLIANT -- BEFORE YOU COME

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:50.904

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:52.906
PART THAT GUN AND SHIP IT TO A

01:41:52.973 --> 01:41:55.542
PRECURSOR PARTS DEALER I MEAN

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:56.643
THIS IS THIS IS.

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:57.277
A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT CRAZY

01:41:57.344 --> 01:41:58.812
FOR COMPLIANCE -- I THINK

01:41:58.879 --> 01:41:59.847
CRIMINALS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:01.215
TO IGNORE THIS LAW THERE CAN

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:02.716
OPERATE OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:03.951
AND I I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:04.918
TO RECEIVE ANY PUBLIC SAFETY

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:07.054

MUCH.

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:51.011
THAT IT'S GETTING HARD TO FIND

GOOD ADDITIONAL BILLS AND I

01:45:52.946 --> 01:45:53.914
THINK THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF

01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:55.749
PROBLEMS.

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:57.451

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:00.754

01:46:13.433 --> 01:46:15.068
GOING TO GO TO APPROPRIATIONS IS

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:17.237

01:52:44.257 --> 01:52:47.694
ASSEMBLY BILL.

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:49.462
NINE SIX FOUR AB NINE SIX FOUR

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:51.164

FACILITIES TO OFFER IN PERSON

01:52:53.533 --> 01:52:57.203
VISITATION BY THE YEAR.

01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.770
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE BILL

01:52:57.837 --> 01:52:59.172
SEEKS TO GIVE INCARCERATED

01:52:59.239 --> 01:53:01.174
PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:03.576
MAINTAIN A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:05.145
WITH THEIR LOVED ONES.

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:07.514
BOTTOM LINE VIDEO VISITS ARE NOT

01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:10.583
EQUIVALENT TO IN PERSON VISITS

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:12.418
AND ARE MUCH LESS PREFERRED THAT

01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:14.921
IS A MUCH LESS PREFERRED WAY. TO

01:53:14.988 --> 01:53:17.690
MAINTAIN CONTACT.

01:53:17.757 --> 01:53:19.526
NOWHERE DO WE DESIRE TO TREAT

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:21.761
THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED AS

01:53:21.828 --> 01:53:24.063
UNDESERVING.

01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:25.298
INCARCERATED MEN AND WOMEN

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:27.433
REMAIN BEING.

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:31.237
FATHERS MOTHERS SISTERS BROTHERS

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:35.208
DAUGHTERS SONS AND PARTNERS.

01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:37.076
WHILE THERE INCARCERATED.

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:38.511
HUMAN CONNECTIONS CAN OFFER

01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:40.747
ACCOUNTABILITY AND MOTIVATION

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:42.282
THAT LEADS TO CHANGE.

01:53:42.348 --> 01:53:44.250
ELIMINATING IN PERSON VISITATION

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:46.452
HAS A DRASTIC A NEGATIVE IMPACT

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:48.154
ON FAMILIES PARTICULARLY

01:53:48.221 --> 01:53:51.224
CHILDREN.

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:53.226
ALSO ACCORDING TO REPORT BY THE

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:55.161
PRISON POLICY INITIATIVE VIDEO

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:56.729
VISITATION.

01:53:56.796 --> 01:54:02.035
IS IS NO WHERE -- AS AFFECTED AS

01:54:02.101 --> 01:54:03.369
IN PERSON VISITATION.

01:54:03.436 --> 01:54:04.504
THERE BEEN REPORTS OF

01:54:04.571 --> 01:54:08.041
MALFUNCTIONS DELAYS AND FREEZES

01:54:08.107 --> 01:54:09.409
WITH VIDEO VISITATIONS.

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:12.178
SOME HAVE INDICATED THAT IS A

01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:14.247
WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:16.849
WHERE TRADITIONAL TELECOMS LIKE

01:54:16.916 --> 01:54:18.718
EIGHTEEN T. AND VERIZON FOCUS ON

01:54:18.785 --> 01:54:20.119
THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE?

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:21.521
IT IS EVIDENT THAT THESE

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:23.723
COMPANIES CONTRACT WITH LOCAL

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:26.326
CONTROL FACILITIES FOCUS ONLY ON

01:54:26.392 --> 01:54:28.228
THE FACILITIES AND NOT WHETHER

01:54:28.294 --> 01:54:30.563
IT WAS A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.

01:54:30.630 --> 01:54:32.665
FOR THOSE USING THAT METHOD OF

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:34.467
VISITATION.

01:54:34.534 --> 01:54:36.035
WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO WITNESSES

01:54:36.102 --> 01:54:38.271
IN SUPPORT.

01:54:38.338 --> 01:54:41.007
RABBI SUZANNE SINGER AND LEASE.

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:48.615
LIZZY MOTION.

01:54:48.681 --> 01:54:50.350
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:54:50.416 --> 01:54:52.318
THERE ARE TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:54.020
IN JUDAISM THE GUIDE HOW WE

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.822
TREAT HUMAN BEINGS.

01:54:55.888 --> 01:54:56.923
AND I THINK THIS APPLIES TO

01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:58.524
OTHER RELIGIONS AS WELL THE

01:54:58.591 --> 01:55:00.960
FIRST IS THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:02.962
BUT CELLUM ELLO HE MADE IN GOD'S

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:04.764
IMAGE.

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:06.366
THE SECOND IS TO SHOE Và.

01:55:06.432 --> 01:55:08.301
WHICH IS OFTEN TRANSLATED AS

01:55:08.368 --> 01:55:11.037
REPENTANCE BUT WHICH REALLY

01:55:11.104 --> 01:55:12.972
MEANS RETURN.

01:55:13.039 --> 01:55:14.941
THE IDEA IS THAT IF AND WHEN WE

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:16.676
VEER OFF THE RIGHT PATH --

01:55:16.743 --> 01:55:17.710
ALWAYS ABLE TO COME BACK TO

01:55:17.777 --> 01:55:20.246
RETURN.

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:21.748
SO BASED ON THESE VALUES AS A

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:24.050
RABBI I BELIEVE THAT IT IS OUR

01:55:24.117 --> 01:55:26.552
JOB AS A SOCIETY. TO RE

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:28.254
INTEGRATE OFFENDERS BACK INTO

01:55:28.321 --> 01:55:30.590
SOCIETY SO THAT THEY CAN BECOME

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:32.058
PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS AND

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:33.693
RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:35.395
COMMUNITY.

01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:37.230
SO I WAS HORRIFIED TO LEARN THAT

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:39.499
THE NEW COUNTY JAIL IN INDIO IN

01:55:39.565 --> 01:55:40.667
RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

01:55:40.733 --> 01:55:42.635
WAS BUILT WITH NO IN PERSON

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:45.805
VISITS BUT ONLY VIDEO CALLS.

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:47.473
THIS IS DE HUMANIZING FOR THOSE

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:49.709
WHO ARE INCARCERATED.

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:51.477
CONTACT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS

01:55:51.544 --> 01:55:53.513
IS ABSOLUTELY KEY TO

01:55:53.579 --> 01:55:55.214
REHABILITATION.

01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:56.749
STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY FOUND

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:58.351
THE PRISONERS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE

01:55:58.418 --> 01:56:00.086
CONTACT WITH THEIR FAMILY

01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:01.721
MEMBERS WHILE INCARCERATED.

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:03.256
HAVE BETTER POST RELEASE

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:05.425
OUTCOMES AND LOWER RECIDIVISM

01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:07.293
RATES.

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.795
ADDITIONALLY VIDEOTAPING

01:56:08.861 --> 01:56:09.929
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE COME

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:11.564
UNDER CRITICISM FOR CHARGING

01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:12.799
HIGH FEES.

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:14.867
AND FOR PROVIDING POOR QUALITY

01:56:14.934 --> 01:56:17.303
VIDEO CONNECTIONS.

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:18.971
VIDEO CAN BE INCREASED

01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:21.240
INCREDIBLY COSTLY NOT JUST FOR

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:22.375
THE INMATE BUT FOR THE LOVED

01:56:22.442 --> 01:56:23.609
ONES AS WELL.

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:25.411
THE COST OF THE VIDEO CALL CAN

01:56:25.478 --> 01:56:27.313
BE AS MUCH AS A DOLLAR A MINUTE.

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:28.715
ACCORDING TO THE PRISON POLICY

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:29.849
INITIATIVE.

01:56:29.916 --> 01:56:30.783
AND THE PEOPLE PAYING FOR THESE

01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:32.485
CALLS ARE THOSE WHO ARE LEAST

01:56:32.552 --> 01:56:35.154
LIKELY TO AFFORD IT.

01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:37.190
FURTHERMORE ES ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:56:37.256 --> 01:56:38.725
OF MEDINA HAS NOTED VIDEO

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.159
TECHNOLOGY OFTEN DISCONNECTS AND

01:56:40.226 --> 01:56:41.461
OUR JOBS AND SKIPS DURING THE

01:56:41.527 --> 01:56:43.029
CALL MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:44.063
FOCUS.

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:45.398
AND THERE IS ANOTHER CRUCIAL

01:56:45.465 --> 01:56:46.699
ISSUE.

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:47.767
THE CHILDREN OF THOSE

01:56:47.834 --> 01:56:49.602
INCARCERATED ARE ALREADY

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:52.205
SUFFERING FROM THE TRAUMA OF

01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:52.739
BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:53.639
PARENTS.

01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:55.475
VIDEO CALLS ONLY PRESENT A

01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:57.076
FURTHER BARRIER TO THESE

01:56:57.143 --> 01:56:59.579
CHILDREN MAINTAINING A CLOSE

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:01.214
CONNECTION WITH THEIR PARENTS.

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.182
THE BIBLE MAKES IT VERY CLEAR

01:57:03.249 --> 01:57:04.817
THAT THE BOND OF LIFE BETWEEN A

01:57:04.884 --> 01:57:07.186
PARENT AND CHILD EVEN AMONG

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.388
ANIMALS IS STRONG.

01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:11.190
AND SACRED.

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:13.326
THE ARGUMENT THE JAIL TIME IS

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:15.261
SHORTER THAN PRISON TIME SO CAN

01:57:15.328 --> 01:57:16.796
BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY NO LONGER

01:57:16.863 --> 01:57:17.930
HOLDS.

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:19.432
EVER SINCE REALIGNMENT MORE

01:57:19.499 --> 01:57:21.234
PEOPLE ARE SERVING TIME IN

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:23.336
COUNTY JAILS AND FOR LONGER

01:57:23.403 --> 01:57:25.204
PERIODS THAN BEFORE.

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:26.439
WITH ONE MILLION PEOPLE

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:27.607

AT THE STATE LEVEL.

WAS A BILL. FOR US TO CHANGE

02:03:03.642 --> 02:03:06.178
THAT ONE FACILITY AND TO IN

02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:07.346
PERSON VISITATION.

02:03:07.413 --> 02:03:09.882
WILL BE A HUGE PROBLEM FOR US.

02:03:09.949 --> 02:03:11.450
NONE OF ROOM ON THAT SITE TO

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:12.585
BUILD A SEPARATE BUILDING.

02:03:12.651 --> 02:03:13.953
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM WITHIN

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:17.223
THE EXISTING WALLS TO FACILITATE.

02:03:17.289 --> 02:03:18.524
IN PERSON VISITATION.

02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:19.792
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE PURCHASE

OF PROPERTY.

02:03:21.794 --> 02:03:22.328

02:03:22.394 --> 02:03:22.928
SITE.

02:03:22.995 --> 02:03:24.497
AND THE ONGOING COSTS WHICH

02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:26.265
WOULD BE INEXPENSIVE IN THE

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:27.433
BEGINNING COMPARED TO THE

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:28.467
ONGOING COST.

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:29.902

QUALITY OF THIS I'M NOT SURE OF

02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:39.612
WHAT -- OTHER FOLKS ARE USING

02:03:46.051 --> 02:03:48.454
DOWN LIKE ANY OTHER SYSTEM WOULD.

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.790
VERY RARE AND WHEN THAT OCCURS

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:52.525

YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT WE REDUCE

02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:32.464
RECIDIVISM IS THAT FOLKS CAN GO

02:23:27.865 --> 02:23:28.900
IF IT'S A CRIMINAL MATTER

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:30.134
DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS SUBPOENA

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:32.570
POWER SO THE NOTION THAT NOBODY

02:23:32.637 --> 02:23:34.639
CAN COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:36.975
DOCUMENTS OR TESTIMONY OR

02:23:37.041 --> 02:23:39.811
WITNESSES -- IS IS I THINK IN

02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:41.546
CORRECT AND AND FRANKLY THE

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:42.480
ANALYSIS POINT SOUTHERLY

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:44.749
SOMEBODY IN A ENTITIES -- AT

02:23:44.816 --> 02:23:45.550
ISSUE HERE ALREADY HAVE THE

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:48.052
ABILITY -- TO BE GIVEN THAT

02:23:48.119 --> 02:23:51.456
SUBPOENA POWER LOCALLY AND SO --

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:53.224
WE ARE OBJECTION IS TO PUTTING

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:54.692
THIS EXPRESS OF FORTY AND

02:23:54.759 --> 02:23:56.094
STATURE WHEN IT ALREADY EXISTS --

02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.895
IT'S GOING TO CREATE UNDUE

02:23:57.962 --> 02:23:59.831
PRESSURE ON COUNTY GOVERNMENTS

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:01.232
TO CREATE THIS TYPE OF

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:03.434
RELATIONSHIP -- WHERE IT IS

02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:04.702
SPECIALLY COUNTIES WHERE THERE

02:24:04.769 --> 02:24:06.304
ISN'T A PERCEIVED ISSUE BUT

02:24:06.371 --> 02:24:07.338
COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:09.841
EXPECTED OR PRESSURED TO ENGAGE

02:24:09.907 --> 02:24:11.843
IN THIS TYPE OF OVERSIGHT -- ONE

02:24:11.909 --> 02:24:12.944
IS NOT DEEMED NECESSARY BY THE

02:24:13.011 --> 02:24:14.212
BOARD BUT THEY'RE SUCCUMBING TO

02:24:14.278 --> 02:24:16.347
POLITICAL PRESSURES AND SO FOR

02:24:16.414 --> 02:24:18.349
THOSE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:24:18.416 --> 02:24:18.716
YOU KNOW ABOUT.

02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:23.921
THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE

02:24:23.988 --> 02:24:24.389
ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:25.256
OPPOSITION.

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:27.025
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:27.825
MEMBERS.

02:24:27.892 --> 02:24:30.728
MR LACKEY MISS COME LOOK AT THE

02:24:30.795 --> 02:24:32.430
REST QUIRK IN [inaudible]

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:33.197
OKAY OKAY.

02:24:33.264 --> 02:24:34.932
THE FIRST OF ALL I WOULD THE I

02:24:34.999 --> 02:24:35.700
WOULD SAY CERTAINLY -- PUBLIC

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:36.934
TRUST TO SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

02:24:37.001 --> 02:24:38.069
TO WORK TOWARD.

02:24:38.136 --> 02:24:40.104
TOWARD BUILDING -- AND IN MANY

02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:41.506
PARTS OF OUR STATE.

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:42.640
BUT THEY'RE ALSO MANY PARTS OF

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:44.542
OUR STATE WERE.

02:24:44.609 --> 02:24:46.511
THE PUBLIC TRUST IS VERY SOUND.

02:24:46.577 --> 02:24:48.646
AND I THINK THAT -- USING THIS

02:24:48.713 --> 02:24:51.215
KIND OF AS A STATE MANDATE IS

02:24:51.282 --> 02:24:52.884
NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY.

02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:55.753
BUT I THINK IN MANY ASPECTS.

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:57.188
IT DISREGARDS THE VOICE VOICE TO

02:24:57.255 --> 02:24:59.023
THE VOTERS BECAUSE THE VOTERS

02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:00.825
ACTUALLY SELECTION ERRORS.

02:25:00.892 --> 02:25:02.927
AND I I THINK THAT.

02:25:02.994 --> 02:25:04.695
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT AN

02:25:04.762 --> 02:25:05.196
OVERSIGHT BOARD FOR THE

02:25:05.263 --> 02:25:06.931
LEGISLATURE.

02:25:06.998 --> 02:25:08.633
THAT MANAGING THOUGHT MAYBE WE

02:25:08.699 --> 02:25:10.468
SHOULD DO THAT.

02:25:10.535 --> 02:25:13.404
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:15.306
COME UNDER THE Q. I WAS

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:17.208
WONDERING I HAVE -- TWO

02:25:17.275 --> 02:25:19.010
QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS HOW WOULD

02:25:19.077 --> 02:25:21.379
THIS OVERSIGHT BOARD WORK IN

02:25:21.446 --> 02:25:24.082
CONJUNCTION WITH -- BOARDS OF

02:25:24.148 --> 02:25:26.751
SUPERVISORS AND ALSO WITH --

02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:29.620
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES I'M

02:25:29.687 --> 02:25:30.621
ASKING BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW IF

02:25:30.688 --> 02:25:32.423
THERE WOULD BE SOME AUTHORITY

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:33.357
OVER LAST.

02:25:33.424 --> 02:25:36.060
AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:38.296
HOW WOULD THIS BOARD -- BE

02:25:38.362 --> 02:25:42.767
DIFFERENT FROM -- SHERIFF

02:25:42.834 --> 02:25:44.202
OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONS SO FOR

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:46.571
EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE

02:25:46.637 --> 02:25:49.140
HAVE AGE -- LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S

02:25:49.207 --> 02:25:50.208
OVERSIGHT COMMISSION SO IF YOU

02:25:50.274 --> 02:25:51.809
COULD JUST SORT OF SHARE THE

02:25:51.876 --> 02:25:52.643
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THE

02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:53.444
BOARD.

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:54.946
WOULD HAVE AUTHORITY OVER AND

02:25:55.012 --> 02:25:55.580
WHAT THE COMMISSION WOULD HAVE

02:25:55.646 --> 02:25:57.115
AUTHORITY OF CHERYL ALL START IN

02:25:57.181 --> 02:25:59.083
TURN OVER TO OUR WITNESS SO IT

02:25:59.150 --> 02:26:02.353
WOULDN'T CREATE ANY NEW ENTITY

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:03.221
JUST CLARIFY WHAT THEY CAN DO.

02:26:03.287 --> 02:26:04.789
FOR EXAMPLE IN IN LA THEY

02:26:04.856 --> 02:26:05.923
WEREN'T ALWAYS GETTING THE

02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:07.325
INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE

02:26:07.391 --> 02:26:08.926
REQUESTING SO THIS WOULD GIVE

02:26:08.993 --> 02:26:10.394
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

02:26:10.461 --> 02:26:12.029
SOME TYPE OF SUBPOENA.

02:26:12.096 --> 02:26:13.431
POWER TO GET THE INFORMATION

02:26:13.498 --> 02:26:16.134
HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAD ENTITY.

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:18.169
AND THERE IT'S ESSENTIALLY SHUT

02:26:18.236 --> 02:26:19.170
OUT.

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:20.404
BY OUR LOCAL SHERIFF BECAUSE YOU

02:26:20.471 --> 02:26:21.772
DON'T REALLY LIKE THE OVERSIGHT

02:26:21.839 --> 02:26:23.407
AND OUR COUNTY COUNCIL ISSUED A

02:26:23.474 --> 02:26:26.544
MEMO WHICH WAS -- MUDDY IS IS A

02:26:26.611 --> 02:26:27.979
NICE DEFINITION.

02:26:28.045 --> 02:26:30.014
AND THAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR

02:26:30.081 --> 02:26:31.015
COMING HERE TO HAVE SOME

02:26:31.082 --> 02:26:32.116
CLARIFICATION AS FAR AS WHAT

02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:33.851
THESE ENTITIES CAN DO AS FAR AS

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:35.987
LOCAL DA'S -- YOU KNOW THEY

02:26:36.053 --> 02:26:37.155
THERE WILL IF THERE'S EVER AN

02:26:37.221 --> 02:26:38.923
ISSUE AN INVESTIGATION THAT WILL

02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.524
GO ON THERE.

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:40.858
I CAN CURRENT PATH INDEPENDENT

02:26:40.925 --> 02:26:44.562
AND WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON

02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:46.063
THEIR ON THEIR LINE OF WORK.

02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:47.765
YEAH AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT --

02:26:47.832 --> 02:26:50.268
THIS SAID THE THE BOARD WOULD BE

02:26:50.334 --> 02:26:51.869
APPOINTING THESE COMMISSIONS AS

02:26:51.936 --> 02:26:52.970
THEY DID THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:55.573
COMMISSION IN LOS ANGELES AND SO

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:58.042
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- CIVIL

02:26:58.109 --> 02:26:59.944
REVIEW BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS

02:27:00.011 --> 02:27:01.979
LIKE THE C. O. C. IN LA -- OR

02:27:02.046 --> 02:27:03.814
INSPECTOR GENERAL SO THOSE ARE --

02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:06.851
THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

02:27:06.918 --> 02:27:09.787
TRYING TO ADDRESS.

02:27:09.854 --> 02:27:10.655
SO GRANTING MORE AUTHORITY TO

02:27:10.721 --> 02:27:11.789
EXISTING ONES OR CREATING

02:27:11.856 --> 02:27:13.324
OPPORTUNITY FOR ONCE TO BE

02:27:13.391 --> 02:27:14.859
DEVELOPED IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:16.294
RIGHT AND AND THAT OPPORTUNITY

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:18.162
DOES EXIST THEY THEY CERTAINLY

02:27:18.229 --> 02:27:21.432
CAN INPUT APPOINT.

02:27:21.499 --> 02:27:24.001
THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:27:24.068 --> 02:27:25.970
MEANINGFULLY PROVIDE OVERSIGHT.

02:27:26.037 --> 02:27:30.908
THANK YOU OF FIFTY FOUR I THINK

02:27:30.975 --> 02:27:32.743
THEY'RE TOO MANY COUNTY ELECTED

02:27:32.810 --> 02:27:37.281
OFFICES -- I WOULD BE QUITE

02:27:37.348 --> 02:27:38.449
HAPPY IF THE BOARD OF

02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:40.751
SUPERVISORS WAS THE ONLY ELECTED

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:42.186
OFFICE IN THE COUNTY.

02:27:42.253 --> 02:27:43.854
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ASSESSOR AND

02:27:43.921 --> 02:27:45.456
SHERIFF IN THE REST OF IT?

02:27:45.523 --> 02:27:47.158
IT JUST SPREADS OUT AUTHORITY IN

02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:49.160
SUCH A WAY YOU'RE NEVER QUITE

02:27:49.227 --> 02:27:50.461
SURE WHO TO GO.

02:27:50.528 --> 02:27:52.997
TO HOWEVER I'M NOT PLANNING TO

02:27:53.064 --> 02:27:55.933
PUT UP CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.669
SO WE'RE LEFT WITH SPLIT THE

02:27:58.736 --> 02:27:59.470
STORY.

02:27:59.537 --> 02:28:02.240
SHERIFF SAYING -- YOU CAN'T TELL

02:28:02.306 --> 02:28:04.976
ME TO DO THIS -- THE COUNTY AT

02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:06.344
LEAST IN MY COUNTY REALLY

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:10.948
DEPENDS UPON THE BUDGET -- TO IT

02:28:11.015 --> 02:28:12.383
TO INFLUENCE WHAT THE SHERIFF

02:28:12.450 --> 02:28:15.019
DOES HE WILL COMPLAIN GREATLY IN

02:28:15.086 --> 02:28:16.354
THE PAPERS ABOUT WHAT GOES ON

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:18.956
IT'S JUST A MESS BUT ANYWAY.

02:28:19.023 --> 02:28:20.524
GETTING BACK TO THAT I DO

02:28:20.591 --> 02:28:22.093
SUPPORT.

02:28:22.159 --> 02:28:23.594
ON OVERSIGHT BOARD HAVING

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:26.063
SUBPOENA POWER MY MAIN CONCERN

02:28:26.130 --> 02:28:27.331
PARTICULARLY FOR GENERAL LAW

02:28:27.398 --> 02:28:30.434
COUNTY SAID TEND TO BE SMALL --

02:28:30.501 --> 02:28:32.003
AND WOULD LIKELY TO HAVE A

02:28:32.069 --> 02:28:33.070
COMMITTEE THAT'S NOT WELL

02:28:33.137 --> 02:28:35.306
STAFFED MY CONCERN IS JUST

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:37.541
HAVING A GROUP OF CIVILIANS.

02:28:37.608 --> 02:28:40.878
VOTE TO HAVE A SUBPOENA AND THEN

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:45.449
THAT BE ISSUED WITHOUT -- BACK

02:28:45.516 --> 02:28:47.218
UP FROM SAY COUNTY COUNCIL.

02:28:47.285 --> 02:28:49.320
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IS

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:52.523
YOUR BILL GOES FORWARD -- TO

02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:54.692
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE IT'S

02:28:54.759 --> 02:28:56.060
ONE THING TO ISSUE A SUBPOENA

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:59.330
AND IT'S ANOTHER THING FOR IT --

02:28:59.397 --> 02:29:00.831
TOO FOR A JUDGE TO SUPPORT IT.

02:29:00.898 --> 02:29:03.668
I THINK THAT YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE

02:29:03.734 --> 02:29:05.036
SOMETHING IN THIS BILL.

02:29:05.102 --> 02:29:07.138
THAT REQUIRES THAT THIS GO

02:29:07.204 --> 02:29:08.105
THROUGH.

02:29:08.172 --> 02:29:10.141
THE COUTY COUNCIL OFFICE MUCH

02:29:10.207 --> 02:29:12.543
LIKE WE GO THROUGH SAY -- TO

02:29:12.610 --> 02:29:15.313
HAVE OUR LEGISLATION LOOKED AT

02:29:15.379 --> 02:29:17.648
BY LEDGE COUNCIL -- BECAUSE

02:29:17.715 --> 02:29:19.216
OTHERWISE I'M WORRIED YOU'RE

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:21.585
GONNA GET SUBPOENAS WHICH MIGHT

02:29:21.652 --> 02:29:23.754
NOT HOLD UP IN COURT -- SO I

02:29:23.821 --> 02:29:24.555
THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:26.791
IMPORTANT ADDITION TO YOUR BILL.

02:29:26.857 --> 02:29:28.926
AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE A

02:29:28.993 --> 02:29:30.961
LOOK AT IT I'M CERTAINLY GLAD TO

02:29:31.028 --> 02:29:33.297
SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY.

02:29:33.364 --> 02:29:34.699
WE WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:36.300
YEAH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD

02:29:36.367 --> 02:29:38.336
SUGGESTION AND YOU KNOW THERE

02:29:38.402 --> 02:29:41.272
ARE SMALL CITIES THAT HAVE --

02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:43.441
THESE OVERSIGHT BODIES AND YOU

02:29:43.507 --> 02:29:45.176
KNOW THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:46.444
WITHOUT HAVING THE STAFFING AND

02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:48.045
OVERSIGHT SO I WHEN WHEN IT.

02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:49.980
JUST THAT DISMISS AT A SMALLER

02:29:50.047 --> 02:29:51.615
COUNTY THAT HAS THIS ENTITY BUT

02:29:51.682 --> 02:29:52.516
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:29:52.583 --> 02:29:53.684
ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:55.353
CERTAINLY WILL CONSIDER GOING.

02:29:55.419 --> 02:29:57.588
FOR OKAY THANK YOU THEN I MOVED

02:29:57.655 --> 02:30:00.057
TO BAIL OUT.

02:30:00.124 --> 02:30:01.992
YES MISS WORKS.

02:30:02.059 --> 02:30:04.061
SO I THINK YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE

02:30:04.128 --> 02:30:05.629
AGREE SUCCESSFUL POLICING IS

02:30:05.696 --> 02:30:07.431
BUILT ON TRUST ANYTHING CAN FAR

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:08.766
TOO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT

02:30:08.833 --> 02:30:10.701
TRUST IS LOST -- AND I THINK

02:30:10.768 --> 02:30:11.902
OVERSIGHT OF SHERIFF IS A

02:30:11.969 --> 02:30:12.970
CRITICAL COMPONENT TO REALLY

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:14.905
ENHANCING -- PUBLIC SAFETY IN

02:30:14.972 --> 02:30:16.507
OUR COMMUNITIES -- ALL BE

02:30:16.574 --> 02:30:18.342
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT

02:30:18.409 --> 02:30:20.878
JUST TO KIND OF PIGGY BACK ON AS

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:24.081
A MEMBER AT COME WATER DIVES.

02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:25.583
QUESTION SO IS IT THAT YOU KNOW

02:30:25.649 --> 02:30:27.184
YOU HAD MENTIONED SIR THAT SOME

02:30:27.251 --> 02:30:28.753
CAN MANY COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE

02:30:28.819 --> 02:30:30.254
AN OVERSIGHT BOARD.

02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:30.888
THAT WOULD THEN MEAN THAT MANY

02:30:30.955 --> 02:30:33.491
COUNTIES DON'T I ASSUME SO WITH

02:30:33.557 --> 02:30:34.125
THIS THIS WOULD CREATE KIND OF

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:35.760
LIKE A FLOOR.

02:30:35.826 --> 02:30:36.394
AND IF COUNTIES HAVE KIND OF

02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:38.262
MORE AGGRESSIVE OVERSIGHT THEY

02:30:38.329 --> 02:30:39.230
COULD STILL IT HERE TO THAT BUT

02:30:39.296 --> 02:30:40.965
IT CREATES A FLOOR FOR THE STATE

02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:41.832
SO THAT ALL.

02:30:41.899 --> 02:30:44.535
SHERIFF'S OFFICES ARE HELD

02:30:44.602 --> 02:30:45.169
ACCOUNTABLE IS THAT KIND OF WAY

02:30:45.236 --> 02:30:47.004
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:48.506
I'M SO ACT ACTUALLY NO IT

02:30:48.572 --> 02:30:50.975
DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY ANY COUNTIES

02:30:51.041 --> 02:30:51.976
COULD TO CREATE AN OVERSIGHT

02:30:52.042 --> 02:30:53.310
BOARD -- ALL BOARDS OF

02:30:53.377 --> 02:30:54.979
SUPERVISORS ARE REQUIRED TO

02:30:55.045 --> 02:30:56.714
OVERSEE AND THEIR SHARE THE

02:30:56.781 --> 02:30:58.282
CONDUCT OF THEIR SHARES -- BUT

02:30:58.349 --> 02:30:59.750
IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM TO

02:30:59.817 --> 02:31:03.687
CREATE AND AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY

02:31:03.754 --> 02:31:04.855
IT WILL IT JUST MERELY.

02:31:04.922 --> 02:31:06.524
LARA FIGHTS THAT THEY CAN DO SO

02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:08.225
AND THAT THOSE ENTITIES.

02:31:08.292 --> 02:31:09.627
THANK YOU AND SO I THINK IT'S

02:31:09.693 --> 02:31:10.428
IMPORTANT NOTED THAT SOME

02:31:10.494 --> 02:31:11.562
COUNTIES ARE DONE THIS THROUGH

02:31:11.629 --> 02:31:12.863
THE ELECTORATE SOME OF THAN THIS

02:31:12.930 --> 02:31:13.664
TO THE COUNTY OARD OF

02:31:13.731 --> 02:31:15.032
SUPERVISORS AND THERE'S A LITTLE

02:31:15.099 --> 02:31:16.600
BIT OF CONFUSION AS FAR AS WHAT

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:18.335
THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO AND SO --

02:31:18.402 --> 02:31:20.204
THIS WOULD WOULD CLARIFY AND

02:31:20.271 --> 02:31:22.907
CODIFY WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO

02:31:22.973 --> 02:31:24.775
THIS OVERSIGHT.

02:31:24.842 --> 02:31:25.042
THANK YOU.

02:31:25.109 --> 02:31:25.843
THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.311
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

02:31:27.378 --> 02:31:28.879
YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED MCCARTY.

02:31:28.946 --> 02:31:30.181
YEAH I THINK THIS IS A A

02:31:30.247 --> 02:31:32.183
NECESSARY STEP BY I RESPECT THE

02:31:32.249 --> 02:31:33.284
OPPOSITION FROM OUR SERVICE

02:31:33.350 --> 02:31:34.919
ASSOCIATION BUT ONE THING THAT

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:36.387
THEY SAID IT'S IT'S UNNECESSARY

02:31:36.454 --> 02:31:37.822
THE ARE YOU CAN DO IT SO MY

02:31:37.888 --> 02:31:39.023
QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.

02:31:39.089 --> 02:31:41.492
OF CODIFYING WHAT THEY CAN DO AS

02:31:41.559 --> 02:31:43.627
A WHOLE AND ALSO THE NOTION OF

02:31:43.694 --> 02:31:45.162
OTHERS -- YOU KNOW OVERSIGHT IS

02:31:45.229 --> 02:31:46.964
A BAD THING WE ALL KNOW THAT

02:31:47.031 --> 02:31:47.731
SUNSHINE IS THE BEST

02:31:47.798 --> 02:31:48.466
DISINFECTANT.

02:31:48.532 --> 02:31:50.100
AND HAVING MORE ENTITIES GOING

02:31:50.167 --> 02:31:52.169
AND LOOKING AT THESE ENTITIES --

02:31:52.236 --> 02:31:53.571
CAN BRING ABOUT MORE PUBLIC

02:31:53.637 --> 02:31:55.139
TRUST WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:58.676
IN OUR POLICING PRACTICES IN TWO

02:31:58.742 --> 02:32:00.511
THOUSAND NINETEEN AND BEYOND ASK

02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:00.911
THE RIGHT THOUGH.

02:32:00.978 --> 02:32:01.979
THANK YOU END UP.

02:32:02.046 --> 02:32:08.052
WITH SOMEONE THAT FROM LA COUNTY --

02:32:08.118 --> 02:32:10.221
SOMEONE THAT MY MAYBE I SHOULD

02:32:10.287 --> 02:32:11.489
BE THE ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN AT

02:32:11.555 --> 02:32:12.490
THAT ENDORSED THE PRESIDENT'S

02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:13.324
CHAIR RIGHT NOW.

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:14.425
AND I PROBABLY GET MORE CALLS

02:32:14.492 --> 02:32:15.693
AND EVER WANTED TO IN MY LIFE --

02:32:15.759 --> 02:32:16.627
BUT I'VE ALSO HAD DISCUSSIONS

02:32:16.694 --> 02:32:18.195
WITH THE SHERIFF THAT WE HAVE

02:32:18.262 --> 02:32:19.530
NOW.

02:32:19.597 --> 02:32:21.098
THEN THE DISCUSSION I HAD BEFORE

02:32:21.165 --> 02:32:21.765
IN DISCUSSION I'M HAVING NOW IT

02:32:21.832 --> 02:32:22.900
SEEMS LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:32:22.967 --> 02:32:25.102
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS SO HAVING

02:32:25.169 --> 02:32:27.638
GUIDELINES VERY IMPORTANT.

02:32:27.705 --> 02:32:29.473
EVEN NOW THERE'S THERE'S EVEN A

02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:32.676
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

02:32:32.743 --> 02:32:34.211
THE SHERIFF CAN HIRE WHO WE ONCE

02:32:34.278 --> 02:32:35.312
AND FOR FIRE WE WANT SO WHO CAN

02:32:35.379 --> 02:32:37.281
FIRE THAT PERSON AND WE DO NEEDS

02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:38.682
SOME SOME CLARITY.

02:32:38.749 --> 02:32:41.018
ON THAT -- ESPECIALLY SINCE

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:42.987
EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE AN ELECTED

02:32:43.053 --> 02:32:43.787
OFFICIAL.

02:32:43.854 --> 02:32:45.122
OF THE THE WORST THING WE COULD

02:32:45.189 --> 02:32:46.757
HAVE RIGHT NOW AND IN THE COUNTY

02:32:46.824 --> 02:32:48.926
OF LOS ANGELES WHICH MAY HAPPEN

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:50.728
IS A RECALL WHICH CALLS EVEN

02:32:50.794 --> 02:32:52.062
MOVE FURTHER.

02:32:52.129 --> 02:32:54.598
CONFUSION BECAUSE THE BOARD

02:32:54.665 --> 02:32:55.232
DOESN'T LIKE TO SHARE OF DOING

02:32:55.299 --> 02:32:57.635

FINANCING OF I KNOW THIS IS THE

02:34:08.739 --> 02:34:10.174
PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE BUT

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:11.709
LITERALLY THIS BILL.

02:34:11.775 --> 02:34:12.843
SHOULD BE HEARD AND LOCAL

02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:14.244
GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND IT'S

02:34:14.311 --> 02:34:15.412
IT'S A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:16.547
FINANCING ISSUE IT'S NOT A

02:34:16.614 --> 02:34:18.048
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE.

02:34:18.115 --> 02:34:19.850
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT WHO CAN

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:21.318
APPLY FOR IS THE C. W.'S ON

02:34:21.385 --> 02:34:23.053
ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS ON ABOUT

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:24.788
WHO CAN ISSUE THEM.

02:34:24.855 --> 02:34:25.823
OR ANY SUBSTANCE JAMES IS THE

02:34:25.889 --> 02:34:27.658
LAW IT'S SIMPLY INSURES THAT

02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:29.893
FEES CHARGED BY A SHARE FOR

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:32.529
POLICE FOR ISSUING A CCW.

02:34:32.596 --> 02:34:34.131
ADEQUATELY COVER THE COST LIKE

02:34:34.198 --> 02:34:35.132
WHEN YOU GO AND GET A MARRIAGE

02:34:35.199 --> 02:34:36.834
LICENSE A BUILDING PERMIT IT

02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:39.003
SHOULD BE BORNE UPON THE USER

02:34:39.069 --> 02:34:40.571
YEAH GETTING THAT PERMITS.

02:34:40.638 --> 02:34:42.006
AND SO THIS IS REALLY A LOCAL

02:34:42.072 --> 02:34:43.307
GOVERNMENT ISSUE HERE IN

02:34:43.374 --> 02:34:45.175
SACRAMENTO -- WE'VE HAD THIS IS

02:34:45.242 --> 02:34:48.012
YOUR LAST FEW YEARS EVERY YEAR --

02:34:48.078 --> 02:34:49.146
WE HAVE TO DIP IN THE COUNTY

02:34:49.213 --> 02:34:52.316
BUDGET BY ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE

02:34:52.383 --> 02:34:52.950
HUNDRED THOUSAND HALF A MILLION

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:54.018
DOLLARS BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE

02:34:54.084 --> 02:34:57.054
FEES. FOR OUR C. C. W.'S WE HAD

02:34:57.121 --> 02:35:00.624
THIS DEBATE TWO YEARS AGO.

02:35:00.691 --> 02:35:01.625
WE ASK THAT THE STATE AUDITOR

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:02.226
LOOKING IN THIS ISSUE TO MAKE

02:35:02.292 --> 02:35:02.726
SURE THAT WE WERE ON TO

02:35:02.793 --> 02:35:04.194
SOMETHING THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT

02:35:04.261 --> 02:35:06.030
ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED -- SHE DID

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:08.265
SOME WORK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:35:08.332 --> 02:35:09.833
AND REVIEWED CEASE W. POLICIES

02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:10.968
IN THE COUNTIES OF SACRAMENTO

02:35:11.035 --> 02:35:12.770
SAN DIEGO AND LA.

02:35:12.836 --> 02:35:15.105
AND FOUND THAT BESIDES COST OVER

02:35:15.172 --> 02:35:16.774
RUNS -- SOME COUNTIES COULDN'T

02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.108
EVEN ACCOUNT OF THE THAT THEY

02:35:18.175 --> 02:35:21.011
CHARGE TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH.

02:35:21.078 --> 02:35:22.446
A FURTHER ARE EXAMPLES OF

02:35:22.513 --> 02:35:24.014
SHERIFFS AND IT ENTITIES NOT

02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:25.549
BEING ABLE TO DO OVERSIGHT TO

02:35:25.616 --> 02:35:28.085
MAKE SURE PEOPLE WAS THE CW'S --

02:35:28.152 --> 02:35:29.586
ARE ARE WARRANTED.

02:35:29.653 --> 02:35:31.455
I THIS IS A FRIGHTENING STORY

02:35:31.522 --> 02:35:32.423
BUT RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE

02:35:32.489 --> 02:35:34.625
CAPITOL HERE FIVE YEARS AGO

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:35.959
THERE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THE

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:38.195
CCW WHO WAS HOLED UP IN THE HIGH

02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:38.629
IT.

02:35:38.696 --> 02:35:40.831
WITH AN ARSENAL OF FIREARMS AND

02:35:40.898 --> 02:35:42.533
AMMUNITION AND HE WANTED TO DO

02:35:42.599 --> 02:35:44.702
HARM TO GOVERNMENT AND THAT WAS

02:35:44.768 --> 02:35:45.836
THE SOLE ISSUE IS OBVIOUSLY

02:35:45.903 --> 02:35:47.171
MENTALLY UNSTABLE LAW

02:35:47.237 --> 02:35:48.939
ENFORCEMENT ABLE TO TO DEAL WITH

02:35:49.006 --> 02:35:50.574
THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE

02:35:50.641 --> 02:35:52.342
HOUSEKEEPING STAFF ALERTED.

02:35:52.409 --> 02:35:53.877
THE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WENT

02:35:53.944 --> 02:35:54.945
TO GO FIND ITS INDIVIDUAL AND

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:56.113
BROUGHT HIM BACK AND WERE ABLE

02:35:56.180 --> 02:35:57.481
TO TAKE CARE THE SITUATION.

02:35:57.548 --> 02:35:59.016
BUT IT JUST SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES

02:35:59.083 --> 02:36:01.285
INDIVIDUALS WHO GETS THE C. W.'S

02:36:01.351 --> 02:36:03.020
AREN'T PROPERLY THAT IT DOES NOT

02:36:03.087 --> 02:36:04.922
AND IF SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT IN

02:36:04.988 --> 02:36:06.023
LARGE PART BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:36:06.090 --> 02:36:07.591
CHARGE ADEQUATE FEES.

02:36:07.658 --> 02:36:09.359
AT THIS WILL HELP MAKE SURE THAT --

02:36:09.426 --> 02:36:10.661
WE DO THAT AND MAKE SURE THE

02:36:10.728 --> 02:36:12.129
TAXPAYERS A GENERAL FUND

02:36:12.196 --> 02:36:14.531

THE EXISTING CCW PERMIT SCHEME

02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:44.641

UNDER THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX --

02:39:46.176 --> 02:39:50.047

LATEST BILLS WRITTEN --

02:39:50.881 --> 02:39:51.615
DIMENSIONS ENFORCEMENT I THINK

02:39:51.682 --> 02:39:53.550
THAT'S VERY VAGUE WHAT DOES THAT

02:39:53.617 --> 02:39:54.551
MEAN DOES THAT MEAN.

02:39:54.618 --> 02:39:57.020
JUST PUTTING IN -- INTO PLACE

02:39:57.087 --> 02:39:59.690
THE LICENSES I MEAN -- REVOKING

02:39:59.756 --> 02:40:01.224

02:40:01.291 --> 02:40:03.126
ANYTHING COULD THIS BE USED TO

TO APPLY FOR AND GET A CCW I

02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:11.668
THINK THAT -- THE THE EASIEST

02:40:11.735 --> 02:40:13.236
THING IN THE MOST LOGICAL THING

02:40:13.303 --> 02:40:14.471
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT COSTS

02:40:14.538 --> 02:40:16.273
IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT

02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:17.574
IS WHAT BOXES DOWN.

02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:18.942
LET'S LOOK AT EXTENDING THE

02:40:19.009 --> 02:40:20.410
PERMIT OUT TO FOUR YEARS LET'S

02:40:20.477 --> 02:40:22.779
DOUBLE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY --

02:40:22.846 --> 02:40:24.815
CUT OUR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN

02:40:24.881 --> 02:40:28.018
HALF WE KNOW THE CCW HOLDERS ARE

02:40:28.085 --> 02:40:29.886

02:40:29.953 --> 02:40:30.387

REQUIREMENTS THERE'S A LIVE

02:40:32.022 --> 02:40:33.590
SCANNED THERE'S A LOT OF PROCESS

02:40:33.657 --> 02:40:34.958
TO GO THROUGH IT AND RIGHT NOW

02:40:35.025 --> 02:40:36.026
CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE

02:40:36.093 --> 02:40:38.161
SHORTEST THE RATIONS FOR CCW

02:40:38.228 --> 02:40:38.729

CHECK THAT THE TAKES PLACE NOW

02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:14.958
THE VAST MAJORITY OF OF COUNTIES.

02:42:15.025 --> 02:42:15.792
THEY DO IT WITH A HUNDRED

02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:16.993

02:42:17.627 --> 02:42:18.595
GUMS.

02:42:18.662 --> 02:42:22.099
IS A IS A AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR

02:42:22.165 --> 02:42:24.534
THEM TO BE ABLE TO TO TO HAVE A

02:42:24.601 --> 02:42:26.636
STREAMLINED SYSTEM THAT WORKS.

02:42:26.703 --> 02:42:28.505

02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:29.339
IT'S WORKING.

02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:31.741

02:42:35.579 --> 02:42:37.647
BUT MAYBE A HANDFUL OF COUNTIES

02:42:37.714 --> 02:42:39.015
THAT ARE SPENDING ACTUALLY MORE

02:42:39.082 --> 02:42:40.283

THEY THEY THEY MIGHT SPEND A

02:42:44.321 --> 02:42:45.455
LITTLE MORE THAN AND THEY STILL

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:46.957
TAKE SOME OF THE THE BUDGET THAT

02:42:47.023 --> 02:42:48.525

RETURN IT BACK TO THE COUNTY --

02:42:50.293 --> 02:42:52.596
SO THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF

02:42:52.662 --> 02:42:54.564
BALANCING EVERYTHING THE

MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK -- SO.

I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT

02:44:09.573 --> 02:44:11.341
I DON'T THINK IT'S PERFECT BUT

02:44:11.408 --> 02:44:15.045
THEN AGAIN NO BILL EVER IS -- SO

02:44:15.111 --> 02:44:19.316
HERE MY CONCERNS -- IF YOU LIFT

02:44:19.382 --> 02:44:21.418
THE LIMIT ALTOGETHER THERE COULD

02:44:21.484 --> 02:44:22.586
BE A COUNTY SAY IN OUR IT'S

02:44:22.652 --> 02:44:24.154
GOING TO BE A THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:44:24.221 --> 02:44:25.522
IS A BACKBOARD.

02:44:25.589 --> 02:44:28.091
AS A BACKROOM WAY TO JUST

02:44:28.158 --> 02:44:29.926
PREVENT C. C. W.'S.

02:44:29.993 --> 02:44:30.460
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S

02:44:30.527 --> 02:44:32.195
APPROPRIATE I WOULD FEEL MORE

02:44:32.262 --> 02:44:34.231
COMFORTABLE WITH LIFTING THE

02:44:34.297 --> 02:44:38.435
LIMIT FROM A HUNDRED TO TWO

02:44:38.501 --> 02:44:39.536
FIFTY AND THEN ADJUSTING FOR

02:44:39.603 --> 02:44:42.672
INFLATION -- I DO THINK THAT

02:44:42.739 --> 02:44:43.273
THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN UPPER

02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:45.342
LIMIT -- WE HAVE THE SECOND

02:44:45.408 --> 02:44:47.677
AMENDMENT WELL I DON'T AGREE

02:44:47.744 --> 02:44:49.112
WITH IT WE HAVE IT AM I AND I

02:44:49.179 --> 02:44:51.214
JUST THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE

02:44:51.281 --> 02:44:56.086
SOME SORT OF THE LIMIT -- IF.

02:44:56.152 --> 02:44:58.121
THE LEAGUE OF CITIES IS CAN I'M

02:44:58.188 --> 02:45:00.523
CONCERNED ALSO -- IS IT THE

02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:03.193
COUNTY OR THE SHERIFF THAT SETS

02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:07.163
THE FEE. FOR THE CC W..

02:45:07.230 --> 02:45:09.065
WELL IT'S BASED UPON STATE LAW

02:45:09.132 --> 02:45:10.667
OF COURSE WITH THAT THE MAXIMAL

02:45:10.734 --> 02:45:11.935
OUT AND THEN THERE'S THAT THE AT

02:45:12.002 --> 02:45:13.370
THE BACKGROUND CHECK FOR THE

02:45:13.436 --> 02:45:16.539
PERMIT JUSTICE -- AND ITS THE

02:45:16.606 --> 02:45:17.707
IT'S THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S WHO

02:45:17.774 --> 02:45:19.576
ARE USUALLY THE OVERSEERS NOT

02:45:19.643 --> 02:45:21.011
NOT CITIES YEAH BUT THE

02:45:21.077 --> 02:45:22.679
TYPICALLY PROCESS WHAT THE FEE

02:45:22.746 --> 02:45:24.581
SHOULD BE IT'S A MAX OF A

02:45:24.648 --> 02:45:26.016
HUNDRED IT CAN BE LAST.

02:45:26.082 --> 02:45:28.385
WHO DECIDES WHAT THAT FEE IS

02:45:28.451 --> 02:45:29.419
WHETHER IT'S SAID AT THE MAX IS

02:45:29.486 --> 02:45:29.753
IT?

02:45:29.819 --> 02:45:32.088
SAID AT ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY

02:45:32.155 --> 02:45:36.393
DOLLARS WHO -- SETS THAT NUMBER

02:45:36.459 --> 02:45:42.832
I THINK IT VARIES.

02:45:42.899 --> 02:45:45.168
SHE I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CHAIR

02:45:45.235 --> 02:45:46.102
OF ANY.

02:45:46.169 --> 02:45:47.604
IT IS THE SHERIFF.

02:45:47.671 --> 02:45:48.271
ALL RIGHT WELL THEN I UNDERSTAND

02:45:48.338 --> 02:45:50.740
MORE YOUR BILL -- I STILL THINK

02:45:50.807 --> 02:45:52.409
THERE SHOULD BE A LIMIT --

02:45:52.475 --> 02:45:53.943
APPROPRIATE WOULD BE SOMETHING

02:45:54.010 --> 02:45:56.046
LIKE TWO FIFTY WITH SAID

02:45:56.112 --> 02:45:57.113
COLLATION ADJUSTER.

02:45:57.180 --> 02:45:59.716
AGAIN I JUST I THINK WE WANT TO

02:45:59.783 --> 02:46:01.151
BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT.

02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:03.286
BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND ALSO WHITES

02:46:03.353 --> 02:46:04.287
THE SHERIFF.

02:46:04.354 --> 02:46:05.488
IF IT'S A SURE IF THE BOARD OF

02:46:05.555 --> 02:46:07.490
SUPERVISORS I THINK THEY CAN

02:46:07.557 --> 02:46:08.525
WORRY ABOUT THEIR OWN.

02:46:08.591 --> 02:46:10.660
BUDGET BUT IF IT IS THE SHERIFFS

02:46:10.727 --> 02:46:12.062
AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO HAVE

02:46:12.128 --> 02:46:13.463
SOMETHING THAT SAYS THAT THE CAR

02:46:13.530 --> 02:46:14.931
SHOULD BE RECOVERED.

02:46:14.998 --> 02:46:16.633
YES AND AND THANK YOU IT'S

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:17.400

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:18.935
GOOD ANY SUPERVISORS NOT HERE

02:46:19.002 --> 02:46:21.371
AND HE WOULD REMIND ME THAT LAST

02:46:21.438 --> 02:46:22.205
YEAR THE COUNTY BOARD OF

02:46:22.272 --> 02:46:24.140
SUPERVISORS ATTEMPTED TO ADJUST

02:46:24.207 --> 02:46:25.575
THE FEE AND THEY COULD NOT

02:46:25.642 --> 02:46:27.344
BECAUSE IT WAS SET.

02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:29.012
BY THE SHARE WHICH IS WHY.

02:46:29.079 --> 02:46:29.879
THEY ARE THE WITNESS TALKED

02:46:29.946 --> 02:46:31.781
ABOUT HOW SOME COUNTY THAT'S NOT

02:46:31.848 --> 02:46:32.582
AN ISSUE WILL IN SACRAMENTO

02:46:32.649 --> 02:46:33.216
COUNTY.

02:46:33.283 --> 02:46:35.852
THIS THIS THIS PAST YEAR IS A

02:46:35.919 --> 02:46:36.419
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

02:46:36.486 --> 02:46:38.455
DEBT OTHER GENERAL FUND TO

02:46:38.521 --> 02:46:39.689
SUBSIDIZE THIS AND THAT'S YOU

02:46:39.756 --> 02:46:41.491
COULD USE THAT MONEY TO HIRE

02:46:41.558 --> 02:46:41.958
THREE MORE.

02:46:42.025 --> 02:46:44.094
SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES PATROLLING

02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:45.695
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SIR OUR OTHER

02:46:45.762 --> 02:46:47.063
PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND

02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:48.665
SO THE IT DICK THE THE COUNTY

02:46:48.732 --> 02:46:49.733
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO HAD WHO

02:46:49.799 --> 02:46:50.934
WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S FULL

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.035
RECOVERY.

02:46:52.102 --> 02:46:53.370
HAVE THEIR HANDS TIED YEAH AND

02:46:53.436 --> 02:46:54.871
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

02:46:54.938 --> 02:46:58.808
SOMETHING AROUND TWO HUNDRED

02:46:58.875 --> 02:47:00.677
FORTY DOLLARS -- WOULD BE WHAT

02:47:00.744 --> 02:47:02.612
DOES SACRAMENTO NEEDS TO RECOVER.

02:47:02.679 --> 02:47:04.114
FOR ODD THAT AND I JUST DON'T

02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:05.915
WANT IT TO GO TO MUCH HIGHER

02:47:05.982 --> 02:47:08.017
THAN THAT THAT'S A CONCERN I

02:47:08.084 --> 02:47:09.386
HAVE YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:11.154
LEGITIMATE ISSUE WE DON'T WANT

02:47:11.221 --> 02:47:13.456
TO HAVE THESE FEES AT FIVE

02:47:13.523 --> 02:47:14.824
THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT -- SO

02:47:14.891 --> 02:47:16.292
THAT'S AN EX AND ACCESSIBLE ONLY

02:47:16.359 --> 02:47:16.893
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE EXTREMELY

02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:18.828
WEALTHY BUT EVERYTHING IS NOT

02:47:18.895 --> 02:47:22.866
JUST -- THE FEES IT'S MAKING

02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:24.501
SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS.

02:47:24.567 --> 02:47:26.236
OUR OUR YOU KNOW OUR APPROPRIATE

02:47:26.302 --> 02:47:27.937
TO HAVE THESE IN -- ABSOLUTELY

02:47:28.004 --> 02:47:28.972
AND SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACT

02:47:29.038 --> 02:47:30.240
AS WELL I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE

02:47:30.306 --> 02:47:33.176
INSANE STORY OF AN INDIVIDUAL.

02:47:33.243 --> 02:47:34.244
THERE'S ANOTHER MAN WHO WENT

02:47:34.310 --> 02:47:36.312
DROVE TO ADD A CCW DROVE TO THE

02:47:36.379 --> 02:47:38.281

SHOT A GUY RIGHT AND HEAD IN THE

02:47:39.015 --> 02:47:39.916

SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS

02:47:47.824 --> 02:47:49.426
MAJORITY PEOPLE PROBABLY ARE LAW

ANECDOTES.

02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:20.590

02:48:20.657 --> 02:48:25.962
DEALS WITH -- FEES AND SO.

02:48:26.029 --> 02:48:27.597
AN EIGHT CAN YOU EXPAND ON IF

02:48:27.664 --> 02:48:29.065

THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND THEN

02:48:37.807 --> 02:48:39.976
HOW ARE WE DEFINING REASONABLE

02:48:40.043 --> 02:48:42.278
COST AND WHY NOT LOOK AT THE

02:48:42.345 --> 02:48:44.414
ACTUAL COST VERSES REASONABLE

02:48:44.481 --> 02:48:45.715
I'M AND I'M JUST TRYING TO

02:48:45.782 --> 02:48:47.050
FIGURE OUT HOW THAT IS DEFINED

02:48:47.116 --> 02:48:49.319
IN IN A WAY THAT.

02:48:49.385 --> 02:48:50.854
IS REASONABLE.

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:52.555
WELL OUT I THINK ALL AND TO THE

02:48:52.622 --> 02:48:53.456
SECOND POINT FIRST.

02:48:53.523 --> 02:48:55.892
WE WE LOOK AT THE SAME ISSUES

02:48:55.959 --> 02:48:57.460
TWO YEARS AGO THREE YEARS AGO

02:48:57.527 --> 02:48:58.828
MAYBE ON THAT SIDE.

02:48:58.895 --> 02:49:00.864
ACTUAL COSTS AND HAVING A

02:49:00.930 --> 02:49:02.499
CAPTAIN SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO

02:49:02.565 --> 02:49:04.033
LOOK AT THIS TO MAKE SURE THE

02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:06.169
FOCUS OF THIS IS NOT TO SET THE

02:49:06.236 --> 02:49:07.103
MATTER PRICE.

02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:09.005
PRICE ALLOWED BUT TO MAKE SURE

02:49:09.072 --> 02:49:12.242
THAT IT IT'S THAT COST RECOVERY.

02:49:12.308 --> 02:49:14.410
LIKE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

02:49:14.477 --> 02:49:15.979
SERVICES ARE DAIS.

02:49:16.045 --> 02:49:18.181
AND WE ASK THE STATE AUDITOR TO

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:19.516
LOOK AT THREE COUNTIES COUPLE

02:49:19.582 --> 02:49:20.583
YEARS AGO THEY LOOKED AT LA

02:49:20.650 --> 02:49:22.385
COUNTY SAN DIEGO IN SACRAMENTO

02:49:22.452 --> 02:49:23.853
AND THEY CAME BACK.

02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:25.488
SAYING IT WASN'T JUST A LOCAL AS

02:49:25.555 --> 02:49:26.689
SHE WASN'T THE BEEF BETWEEN

02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:27.857
SACRAMENTO.

02:49:27.924 --> 02:49:29.792
AND ADVOCATES WHO WANTED TO MAKE

02:49:29.859 --> 02:49:31.294
SURE THIS IS COVERED THIS WAS A

02:49:31.361 --> 02:49:33.196
STATEWIDE PROBLEM WE DIDN'T HAVE

02:49:33.263 --> 02:49:34.330
SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE

02:49:34.397 --> 02:49:35.331
THERE WAS THERE WAS.

02:49:35.398 --> 02:49:37.100
THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:49:37.166 --> 02:49:38.334
RECOVERY AND SOME OF THE

02:49:38.401 --> 02:49:40.570
SHERIFF'S CAME BACK AND SAID WE

02:49:40.637 --> 02:49:42.539

02:49:42.605 --> 02:49:43.673
OUR HANDS ARE TIED A LITTLE BIT

02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:46.643
SO I THINK THIS IS -- CLARIFIES --

02:49:46.709 --> 02:49:47.911
WHAT THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:52.148
SHOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S

02:49:52.215 --> 02:49:53.516
ADEQUATE COST RECOVERY?

02:49:53.583 --> 02:49:54.851
BUT WE WILL I THINK TAKE INTO

02:49:54.918 --> 02:49:55.218
CONSIDERATION.

02:49:55.285 --> 02:49:56.252

02:50:00.089 --> 02:50:01.524
NUMBER IS ACCURATE.

02:50:01.591 --> 02:50:02.425
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE

02:50:02.492 --> 02:50:04.193
WHEN I ALSO HEAR COST RECOVERY

02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:05.128

02:50:12.135 --> 02:50:13.636
PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:50:13.703 --> 02:50:15.305

I'LL MOVE THE BELL.

03:22:50.057 --> 03:22:52.159
ALL RIGHT I THINK THE RECORDS

CLERKS ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

03:22:55.696 --> 03:22:57.231
AS CHAIR OF BUDGET IS THERE

03:22:57.298 --> 03:22:58.366
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO BECAUSE

03:22:58.432 --> 03:23:00.101
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE

03:23:00.167 --> 03:23:02.069
RECORD CLERKS I THINK. TO FOLLOW

03:23:02.136 --> 03:23:03.905
THROUGH ON THIS WOULD YOU CARE

03:23:03.971 --> 03:23:05.006
TO COMMENT.

03:23:05.072 --> 03:23:06.274
SURE NOT ABOUT TURN OVER THE

03:23:06.340 --> 03:23:07.608
DA'S OFFICE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

03:23:07.675 --> 03:23:09.677
TALKING TO Y. DOJ.

03:23:09.744 --> 03:23:12.847
AGAIN THE IDEA IS ASKING DOJ TO

03:23:12.914 --> 03:23:15.316
PUT TOGETHER -- THE DATABASE OF

03:23:15.383 --> 03:23:17.084
ALL THE MILLIONS OF NAMES AND

03:23:17.151 --> 03:23:20.121
THEN BY HAVING A CENTRALIZED.

03:23:20.187 --> 03:23:22.123
DATABASE WHICH WILL BE UPDATED.

03:23:22.189 --> 03:23:22.924
AND KEPT UP TO DATE THE STATE

03:23:22.990 --> 03:23:24.759
LEVEL THAT DATABASE WILL THEN BE

03:23:24.825 --> 03:23:26.961
CIRCULATED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT

03:23:27.028 --> 03:23:28.162
COUNTIES.

03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:29.730
SO AGAIN THE COUNTIES WILL

03:23:29.797 --> 03:23:31.832
REALLY HAVE TO AUTOMATE ANYTHING

03:23:31.899 --> 03:23:33.968
THEY WOULD JUST NEED TO BE ABLE

03:23:34.035 --> 03:23:35.403
TO REFERENCE THE DATABASE AND

03:23:35.469 --> 03:23:35.603
THEN.

03:23:35.670 --> 03:23:37.638
BE ABLE TO NOT RELEASE THE

03:23:37.705 --> 03:23:38.906
INFORMATION ONCE THOSE

03:23:38.973 --> 03:23:40.408
BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE PEOPLE ARE

03:23:40.474 --> 03:23:42.977
CALLING ABOUT SPECIFIC PEOPLE SO.

03:23:43.044 --> 03:23:44.779
HOW HOW THEY WANT TO TAKE THAT

03:23:44.845 --> 03:23:47.048
INFORMATION THEY'RE RECEIVING

03:23:47.114 --> 03:23:47.415
FROM THE STATE?

03:23:47.481 --> 03:23:49.250
AND DO SOMETHING WITH THE

03:23:49.317 --> 03:23:50.885
RECORDS IS REALLY UP TO THEM BUT

03:23:50.952 --> 03:23:52.553
ALL WERE TO ASK THEM IS NOT TO

03:23:52.620 --> 03:23:55.189
RELEASE THE INFORMATION THAT

03:23:55.256 --> 03:23:56.657
THEY HAVE.

03:23:56.724 --> 03:23:58.392
AND I WOULD SAID I'M SORRY.

03:23:58.459 --> 03:23:59.694
THE PROFESSOR -- I WOULD SAY

03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:00.828
ACTUALLY THAT COURT SIX CROSS

03:24:00.895 --> 03:24:01.629
THE STATE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS

03:24:01.696 --> 03:24:02.797
ARE ALREADY DECIDING WHICH

03:24:02.863 --> 03:24:04.198
RECORDS TO RELEASE IN WHICH

03:24:04.265 --> 03:24:06.100
RECORDS TO NOT RELEASE -- THIS

03:24:06.167 --> 03:24:08.069
WOULD THROUGH THE CURRENT DOJ

03:24:08.135 --> 03:24:09.503
DATABASE OR BE AN ALGORITHM THAT

03:24:09.570 --> 03:24:11.038
WOULD BE APPLIED SO WOULD BE A

03:24:11.105 --> 03:24:12.740
COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH WOULD

03:24:12.807 --> 03:24:13.841
LOOK AT BASICALLY.

03:24:13.908 --> 03:24:16.243
ASSESS ELIGIBILITY WHICH IS THE

03:24:16.310 --> 03:24:17.011
CURRENT ELIGIBILITY UNDER

03:24:17.078 --> 03:24:18.980
CURRENT LAW AND IT WOULD

03:24:19.046 --> 03:24:20.214
AUTOMATE THE SYSTEM OF WHO IS

03:24:20.281 --> 03:24:21.549
ELIGIBLE AND WHO'S NOT.

03:24:21.616 --> 03:24:22.984
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DETERMINED TO

03:24:23.050 --> 03:24:24.118
BE ELIGIBLE BY THIS COMPUTER

03:24:24.185 --> 03:24:25.286
PROGRAM WOULD.

03:24:25.353 --> 03:24:27.421
THERE BY HAS RECORD CLEARANCE

03:24:27.488 --> 03:24:28.789
RELIEF GRANTED AUTOMATICALLY

03:24:28.856 --> 03:24:29.924
INSTEAD OF GOING TO A PETITION

03:24:29.991 --> 03:24:31.759
BASED PROCESS WHICH REQUIRES THE

03:24:31.826 --> 03:24:33.327
COURT TO HEAR THIS AND TO MAKE A

03:24:33.394 --> 03:24:34.829
DETERMINATION WHICH IS.

03:24:34.895 --> 03:24:36.163
A DE FACTO EFFECTIVELY IT

03:24:36.230 --> 03:24:37.765
HAPPENS ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY IN

03:24:37.832 --> 03:24:38.933
THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE BUT IT'S

03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:40.368
BASICALLY JUST.

03:24:40.434 --> 03:24:41.469
IF THEY MEET THE ELIGIBILITY

03:24:41.535 --> 03:24:43.337
REQUIREMENT THE COURT GRANTED SO

03:24:43.404 --> 03:24:44.839
THIS WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY WILL IN

03:24:44.905 --> 03:24:46.207
THE LONG TERM ACTUALLY REDUCE

03:24:46.273 --> 03:24:47.108
COSTS BY.

03:24:47.174 --> 03:24:48.743
USING COMPUTERS TO DO WHAT WHAT

03:24:48.809 --> 03:24:50.177
IS RIGHT NOW A VERY ONEROUS

03:24:50.244 --> 03:24:52.580
HUMAN PROCESS -- AND THEN A

03:24:52.647 --> 03:24:53.781
NOTIFICATION WILL GO FROM THE

03:24:53.848 --> 03:24:55.516
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO THE

03:24:55.583 --> 03:24:56.884
COUNTY COURTS AND THEN THEY'LL

03:24:56.951 --> 03:24:57.518
JUST DO WHAT THEY CURRENTLY DO

03:24:57.585 --> 03:24:58.919
THEY LOOK AT WHICH RECORDS THEY

03:24:58.986 --> 03:25:01.222
CAN AND THEY CAN'T PROVIDE.

03:25:01.288 --> 03:25:03.124
TO THE PERSON REQUESTING RECORDS --

03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:04.191

INFORMATION IS AND IS NOT.

03:25:10.965 --> 03:25:12.566
ABLE TO BE AUTOMATED -- AND SHE

03:25:12.633 --> 03:25:13.834
HAS REALLY BEEN DOING A

03:25:13.901 --> 03:25:14.902
PHENOMENAL JOB TO TO PUT

03:25:14.969 --> 03:25:16.470
TOGETHER SOME MORE ELIGIBILITY

03:25:16.537 --> 03:25:18.606
REQUIRE SOME MORE TO DICTATE

03:25:18.673 --> 03:25:20.341
MORE CLEARLY TO THE DOJ.

03:25:20.408 --> 03:25:21.108
BASED ON WHAT IS IN THEIR

03:25:21.175 --> 03:25:22.810
DATABASE WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE

03:25:22.877 --> 03:25:24.612
AUTOMATED SO WE'VE WE'VE GONE

03:25:24.679 --> 03:25:25.279
THROUGH THIS TO TRY TO MAKE IT

03:25:25.346 --> 03:25:26.080
AS LITTLE.

03:25:26.147 --> 03:25:27.748
AS LITTLE AS LEAST ONEROUS AS

03:25:27.815 --> 03:25:33.888
POSSIBLE IN THE DOJ AND EVERYONE

03:25:33.954 --> 03:25:34.088

JUST UNDERSTAND WHY WHY IT'S SO

03:25:37.825 --> 03:25:38.092
IMPORTANT IS.

03:25:38.159 --> 03:25:38.726
RIGHT NOW WE ESTIMATE THE COST

03:25:38.793 --> 03:25:39.460
TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO'S

03:25:39.527 --> 03:25:41.829
PURSUING EXPUNGEMENT IS ABOUT

03:25:41.896 --> 03:25:42.730
THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS.

03:25:42.797 --> 03:25:43.597
IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WE

03:25:43.664 --> 03:25:45.433
FAMILIES DON'T EVEN HAVE FIVE

03:25:45.499 --> 03:25:46.100
HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THEIR SAVINGS

03:25:46.167 --> 03:25:46.701
ACCOUNT.

03:25:46.767 --> 03:25:47.501
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO PURSUE

03:25:47.568 --> 03:25:48.903
EXPUNGEMENT AND THEN IF THEY

03:25:48.969 --> 03:25:51.072
NEVER PURSUE EXPUNGEMENT AGAIN.

03:25:51.138 --> 03:25:52.206
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET HOUSING

03:25:52.273 --> 03:25:53.941
AND EMPLOYMENT SO THEY END UP ON

03:25:54.008 --> 03:25:55.309

MONEY AT STAKE FROM THE STATE

03:25:58.813 --> 03:25:59.513
POINT OF VIEW.

03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:01.082
AN AUTOMATED RECORD SYSTEM -- IS

03:26:01.148 --> 03:26:02.383
PRESUMED TO COSTS ABOUT FOUR

03:26:02.450 --> 03:26:04.985

STATE -- SO AGAIN I WAS HOMELESS

03:26:15.763 --> 03:26:17.531
AND POOR THE ONLY REASON I WAS

03:26:17.598 --> 03:26:19.233
ABLE TO GET THE PROCESS IS

03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:20.735
BECAUSE I HAD COMMUNITY HELP

03:26:20.801 --> 03:26:22.303
WITHOUT THAT COMMUNITY HELP.

03:26:22.369 --> 03:26:23.738
I WOULD NOT HAVE PURSUED THIS

03:26:23.804 --> 03:26:25.306
PROCESS BECAUSE IT DOES COST

03:26:25.372 --> 03:26:27.475
UPWARDS OF THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED

SERVICE -- THEY HAVE TO SAY THAT --

03:28:09.944 --> 03:28:11.745
THE REASON BEHIND THIS BILL IS

SOCIETY TO STRIKE A BALANCE

03:28:25.359 --> 03:28:26.794

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE WHERE OUR

03:29:37.264 --> 03:29:38.332

EXAMPLE WHEN WE FIRST GET THERE

03:29:44.738 --> 03:29:46.373
WE DETAIN EVERYBODY AND TRY TO

03:29:46.440 --> 03:29:47.775

03:30:17.638 --> 03:30:19.206
EIGHT FULL TIME EQUIVALENCY

03:30:19.273 --> 03:30:20.307

THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT AS

03:30:29.516 --> 03:30:30.751
WELL BECAUSE PART OF THE Là

03:31:09.289 --> 03:31:11.025

03:34:11.838 --> 03:34:13.340
DOCUMENTATION OF EVERY ROUTINE

03:34:13.407 --> 03:34:15.075
CALLS FOR SERVICE IT IS ONLY

03:34:15.142 --> 03:34:16.009
WHEN A CALL FOR SERVICE IS

03:34:16.076 --> 03:34:18.845
EXTENDED. TO INCLUDE A STOP --

03:34:18.912 --> 03:34:20.547
AND AT THAT POINT THERE

03:34:20.614 --> 03:34:22.683
ABSOLUTELY IS DISCRETION BY AN

03:34:22.749 --> 03:34:24.418
OFFICER AND SO IF.

03:34:24.484 --> 03:34:26.720
IF I WERE TO CALL IN A BURGLARY

03:34:26.787 --> 03:34:28.722
AN OFFICER COMES I AM ACTUALLY I

03:34:28.789 --> 03:34:29.823
AM FREE TO GO BUT THE IF THE

03:34:29.890 --> 03:34:31.158
OFFICER STOPS ONE OF MY

03:34:31.225 --> 03:34:33.260
NEIGHBORS WALKING BY.

03:34:33.327 --> 03:34:34.695
THAT IS WITHIN THEIR DISCRETION

03:34:34.761 --> 03:34:36.330
AND THAT IS A STOP AND SHOULD

03:34:36.396 --> 03:34:39.433
AND IS A PROPERLY -- CONSIDER TO

03:34:39.499 --> 03:34:40.500
STOP.

03:34:40.567 --> 03:34:42.169
AND SOMEONE CALLS THE POLICE TO

03:34:42.236 --> 03:34:43.503
SAY THAT THEY THINK THAT THERE'S

03:34:43.570 --> 03:34:44.605
A DRUG DEAL GOING ON IN THEIR

03:34:44.671 --> 03:34:46.607
NEIGHBORHOOD AND OFFICER A

03:34:46.673 --> 03:34:49.009
RESPONSE THAT SITUATION AND STOP

03:34:49.076 --> 03:34:50.544
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WALKING BY.

03:34:50.611 --> 03:34:52.112
THEY THEY HAVE DISCRETION AND IN

03:34:52.179 --> 03:34:54.147
DOING THAT AND THAT ABSOLUTELY

03:34:54.214 --> 03:34:55.949
NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED.

03:34:56.016 --> 03:34:58.118
I HAVE THE SECOND.

03:34:58.185 --> 03:34:59.753
CONCERN IS THAT IF.

03:34:59.820 --> 03:35:01.321
THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT IT

03:35:01.388 --> 03:35:02.823
BECAUSE IN OFFICERS RESPONDING

03:35:02.889 --> 03:35:04.591
TO THIS CALL FOR SERVICE THAT

03:35:04.658 --> 03:35:06.793
THEY ARE NOT -- IN THAT BECAUSE

03:35:06.860 --> 03:35:08.228
THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE THEIR

03:35:08.295 --> 03:35:09.229
DISCRETION WHETHER RESPOND OR

03:35:09.296 --> 03:35:10.831
NOT THAT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE

03:35:10.897 --> 03:35:13.033
INCLUDED SO -- IN ADDITION TO

03:35:13.100 --> 03:35:14.534
WHAT I JUST WENT THROUGH ABOUT

03:35:14.601 --> 03:35:15.035
THE DISCUSSION THAT THEY

03:35:15.102 --> 03:35:17.404
ACTUALLY DO HAVE THERE IS.

03:35:17.471 --> 03:35:19.339
BIAS IN PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING

03:35:19.406 --> 03:35:20.474
POLICE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

03:35:20.540 --> 03:35:22.409
THE REP ABOARD HAS RECOGNIZED

03:35:22.476 --> 03:35:23.844
THAT IS WHY THEY DESIGNATED THE

03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:25.612
SUBCOMMITTEE ON CALLS FOR

03:35:25.679 --> 03:35:27.014
SERVICE TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS

03:35:27.080 --> 03:35:28.882
CALLED BIAS BY PROXY.

03:35:28.949 --> 03:35:30.951
AND SO THAT IS WHERE STE YOU

03:35:31.018 --> 03:35:32.286
KNOW WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN THE

03:35:32.352 --> 03:35:33.620
NEWS RECENTLY WHERE PEOPLE CALL

03:35:33.687 --> 03:35:34.855
THE POLICE.

03:35:34.921 --> 03:35:36.523
ON PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:38.959
DISTRUST OF OF PEOPLE THAT RACE

03:35:39.026 --> 03:35:40.294
OF PEOPLE WITHOUT APPEARANCE

03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:41.962
ETCETERA AND THAT IS

03:35:42.029 --> 03:35:43.797
UNFORTUNATELY AN IMPORTANT

03:35:43.864 --> 03:35:45.932
SOURCE OF BIAS IN OUR POLICING

03:35:45.999 --> 03:35:47.100
SYSTEM AS AN IMPORTANT.

03:35:47.167 --> 03:35:48.402
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE RACIAL

03:35:48.468 --> 03:35:49.503
DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

03:35:49.569 --> 03:35:51.571
SYSTEM AND SO RIVER WAS NOT JUST

03:35:51.638 --> 03:35:54.074
ABOUT -- BIAS BY OFFICERS IS

03:35:54.141 --> 03:35:57.778
ABOUT BIAS IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

03:35:57.844 --> 03:35:59.713
OF POLICING -- AND THAT A COUPLE

03:35:59.780 --> 03:36:01.481
POINTS I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT SOME

03:36:01.548 --> 03:36:02.316
OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE HEARD

03:36:02.382 --> 03:36:04.484
BEFORE SO ONE IS -- ABOUT THE

03:36:04.551 --> 03:36:06.253
BURDEN BECAUSE IT'S THAT SUCH A

03:36:06.320 --> 03:36:09.122
HIGH VOLUME OF OF CALLS ARE OF

03:36:09.189 --> 03:36:10.757
STOPS THAT ARE IN RESPONSE TO

03:36:10.824 --> 03:36:11.692
CALLS FOR SERVICE.

03:36:11.758 --> 03:36:13.427
THIS AS WAS DISCUSSED BY THE

03:36:13.493 --> 03:36:15.162
RIVER BOARD THIS IS EXACTLY WHY

03:36:15.228 --> 03:36:16.697
THIS NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED

03:36:16.763 --> 03:36:19.166
BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WAY

03:36:19.232 --> 03:36:20.367
THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND

03:36:20.434 --> 03:36:22.069
POLICE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER.

03:36:22.135 --> 03:36:23.370
AND SAID ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE

03:36:23.437 --> 03:36:25.172
INCLUDED A FOR GOING TO HAVE A

03:36:25.238 --> 03:36:27.207
COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF HOW OUR

03:36:27.274 --> 03:36:30.177
SYSTEM IS BIASED -- AND SECOND --

03:36:30.243 --> 03:36:31.912
AS I SAID BEFORE THIS DOES NOT

03:36:31.978 --> 03:36:34.147
INCLUDE ALL CALLS FOR SERVICE IT

03:36:34.214 --> 03:36:35.782
IS ONLY WHEN THEY'RE EXTENDED

03:36:35.849 --> 03:36:37.451
AND A STOP TAKES PLACE.

03:36:37.517 --> 03:36:40.153
SO -- WE THINK THAT THIS IS

03:36:40.220 --> 03:36:41.288
BECAUSE FOR INCLUDING BECAUSE

03:36:41.355 --> 03:36:44.124
OUR SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY WITHIN

03:36:44.191 --> 03:36:46.393
THE INTENT OF AB -- NINE FIVE

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:47.127
THREE AND IS A VERY VERY

03:36:47.194 --> 03:36:49.363
IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING BY

03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:50.630
CENTER SYSTEM.

03:36:50.697 --> 03:36:53.834
SEVEN WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL

03:36:53.900 --> 03:36:55.035
OPPOSITION.

03:36:55.102 --> 03:36:55.969
THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER.

03:36:56.036 --> 03:36:57.204
MEMBERS ANYONE ELSE IN

03:36:57.270 --> 03:36:59.206
OPPOSITION.

03:36:59.272 --> 03:37:01.074
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

03:37:01.141 --> 03:37:01.908
MEMBERS.

03:37:01.975 --> 03:37:04.411
I HAVE ONE YES.

03:37:04.478 --> 03:37:07.381
I THINK MY MY FRUSTRATION

03:37:07.447 --> 03:37:09.349
BECAUSE OF THIS DISCRETIONARY

03:37:09.416 --> 03:37:09.649
[inaudible]

03:37:09.716 --> 03:37:10.884
DISCUSSION.

03:37:10.951 --> 03:37:14.020
SO LET ME JUST CLARIFY WITH YOU.

03:37:14.087 --> 03:37:17.023
WHEN AN OFFICER GETS CALLED

03:37:17.090 --> 03:37:17.324
[inaudible]

03:37:17.391 --> 03:37:19.459
TO A CIRCUMSTANCE.

03:37:19.526 --> 03:37:22.095
AND THEY ARRIVE ON SCENE.

03:37:22.162 --> 03:37:22.963
AND THEY WITNESSED WHAT THEY

03:37:23.029 --> 03:37:26.266
WERE CALLED. TO WITNESS YOU SAY

03:37:26.333 --> 03:37:27.434
THAT THEY HAVE DISCRETION TO

03:37:27.501 --> 03:37:30.036
DISMISS THAT.

03:37:30.103 --> 03:37:31.805
I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT

03:37:31.872 --> 03:37:33.807
AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE

03:37:33.874 --> 03:37:35.909
AN OBLIGATION TO ACT NO YES

03:37:35.976 --> 03:37:37.310
RIGHT AND ABSOLUTELY AND TO

03:37:37.377 --> 03:37:39.279
RESPOND TO TO A CALL FOR SERVICE.

03:37:39.346 --> 03:37:40.547
AND IF IT'S A SITUATION LIKE

03:37:40.614 --> 03:37:42.315
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AND THAT

03:37:42.382 --> 03:37:43.550
THAT IS GOING TO BE SHOWN IN THE

03:37:43.617 --> 03:37:46.286
ANALYSIS AND SO IT'S NOT.

03:37:46.353 --> 03:37:48.054
IT IS SO SO I THINK THAT THAT

03:37:48.121 --> 03:37:50.323
WILL BE ROUGH REFLECTED I THINK

03:37:50.390 --> 03:37:51.691
THIS IS WHAT HE'S GETTING AT

03:37:51.758 --> 03:37:53.393
THOSE THERE'S REALLY NOT.

03:37:53.460 --> 03:37:54.895
DISCRETION TO ACT THERE HAD TO

03:37:54.961 --> 03:37:56.196
CALL THE SERVICE AND THEIR

03:37:56.263 --> 03:37:57.964
VALIDATING WHAT THEY WERE CALLED

03:37:58.031 --> 03:37:58.799
TO THAT'S NOT A BLACK A

03:37:58.865 --> 03:38:01.301
PROACTIVE ENCOUNTER OF ANY SORT.

03:38:01.368 --> 03:38:02.702
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED

03:38:02.769 --> 03:38:04.604
TO BE MONDAY TRAINERS BECAUSE

03:38:04.671 --> 03:38:06.173
THOSE PROACTIVE CAUGHT CONTACTS.

03:38:06.239 --> 03:38:10.744
THIS IS AN OBLIGATION TO ACT AND

03:38:10.811 --> 03:38:11.311
I DON'T THINK THAT INCLUDES

03:38:11.378 --> 03:38:12.045
DISCRETION.

03:38:12.112 --> 03:38:13.380
AND SO SOMETIMES A OFTEN AN

03:38:13.447 --> 03:38:14.614
OFFICER WILL WITNESS SOMETHING

03:38:14.681 --> 03:38:16.416
AND THEN WILL ACT ON THAT --

03:38:16.483 --> 03:38:17.951
SOMETIMES AN OFFICER.

03:38:18.018 --> 03:38:19.386
HAS NOT WAS WITNESSED IT IS

03:38:19.453 --> 03:38:21.087
RESPONDING TO SOMETHING THAT THE

03:38:21.154 --> 03:38:23.123
CALLER HAS WITNESSED AND THEN

03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:25.292
THEY DO HAVE DISCRETION WITH ARE

03:38:25.358 --> 03:38:28.228
FROM MONCTON TO STOP -- I MEAN

03:38:28.295 --> 03:38:28.962
THIS IS.

03:38:29.029 --> 03:38:29.963
IT.

03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:32.265
IT IS INDICATED WHEN A STOP IS

03:38:32.332 --> 03:38:33.166
IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR

03:38:33.233 --> 03:38:34.267
SERVICE THAT IS PART OF THE

03:38:34.334 --> 03:38:36.203
DOCUMENTATION AND SO THOSE CAN

03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:38.438
BE EVALUATED SEPARATELY FROM

03:38:38.505 --> 03:38:39.139
OTHER.

03:38:39.206 --> 03:38:42.142
OTHER STOPS FOR THE DISAGREEMENT

03:38:42.209 --> 03:38:43.243
IS ON THE SLOW AS WHY IS THAT IN

03:38:43.310 --> 03:38:44.845
PART OF THE DOCUMENTATION

03:38:44.911 --> 03:38:45.445
BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXPECTATION

03:38:45.512 --> 03:38:47.013
THERE.

03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:48.215
IT'S NOT DISCRETIONARY SO I

03:38:48.281 --> 03:38:50.150
THINK WE JUST DISAGREE ON THE

03:38:50.217 --> 03:38:52.385
NEED TO DOCUMENT THAT.

03:38:52.452 --> 03:38:53.386
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible]

03:38:53.453 --> 03:38:55.121
BECKHAM.

03:38:55.188 --> 03:38:56.223
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE PART

03:38:56.289 --> 03:38:57.491
OF OVER DOCUMENTING IS WHAT

03:38:57.557 --> 03:38:59.092
HAPPENS ABOUT STOP AS WELL RIGHT

03:38:59.159 --> 03:39:00.927
WHETHER RASTER KERR'S HOW FAR IS

03:39:00.994 --> 03:39:02.095
GONE AND THERE COULD BE

03:39:02.162 --> 03:39:03.063
DIFFERENCES IN HOW WE'RE

03:39:03.129 --> 03:39:04.998
TREATING FOLKS IN THOSE STOPS

03:39:05.065 --> 03:39:06.032
AND NOT MIGHT BE IN.

03:39:06.099 --> 03:39:07.067
THAT WOULD BE THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:39:07.133 --> 03:39:08.301
DOCUMENTING AND I UNDERSTAND

03:39:08.368 --> 03:39:10.103
THAT CORRECTLY.

03:39:10.170 --> 03:39:12.506
YES THAT'S CORRECT.

03:39:12.572 --> 03:39:14.908
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

03:39:14.975 --> 03:39:16.276
YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED OBERNOLTE I

03:39:16.343 --> 03:39:17.310
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE

03:39:17.377 --> 03:39:19.012
TO RESPOND A COUPLE A COUPLE OF

03:39:19.079 --> 03:39:20.113
THE POINTS MADE BY THE

03:39:20.180 --> 03:39:21.882
OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY.

03:39:21.948 --> 03:39:23.350
THE LAW.

03:39:23.416 --> 03:39:25.585
AB NINE FIFTY THREE DOES NOT SAY

03:39:25.652 --> 03:39:27.387
THAT.

03:39:27.454 --> 03:39:29.256
US RECALLS FOR SERVICER STOPS IN

03:39:29.322 --> 03:39:30.557
THE AUTHOR HAS SAID THAT THAT

03:39:30.624 --> 03:39:33.026
WAS NOT THE INTENTION.

03:39:33.093 --> 03:39:34.528
THE REPORT DOES NOT.

03:39:34.594 --> 03:39:35.862
RIGHT STATE LAW THE ATTORNEY

03:39:35.929 --> 03:39:38.098
GENERAL DOES NOT RIGHT STATE LAW

03:39:38.164 --> 03:39:39.399
WE'VE RIGHT STATE LAW.

03:39:39.466 --> 03:39:40.800
AND SO I THINK WE HAVE AN

03:39:40.867 --> 03:39:42.302
OBLIGATION TO CLARIFY.

03:39:42.369 --> 03:39:43.770
IF THIS IS A A QUESTION BEFORE

03:39:43.837 --> 03:39:44.905
US WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CALLS

03:39:44.971 --> 03:39:46.006
FOR STOPS.

03:39:46.072 --> 03:39:47.340
ARE ALL CALLS FOR SERVICE ARE

03:39:47.407 --> 03:39:48.275
INDEED STOPS.

03:39:48.341 --> 03:39:49.476
AND I I WANNA PUSH BACK ON

03:39:49.543 --> 03:39:50.544
SOMETHING ELSE HAS BEEN SAID

03:39:50.610 --> 03:39:51.711
WHICH IS THAT.

03:39:51.778 --> 03:39:54.114
OF THE THESE RIPPER PORTS.

03:39:54.180 --> 03:39:55.882
CAN BE USED TO TRY AND IDENTIFY

03:39:55.949 --> 03:39:57.751
BIAS IN CALLS FOR SERVICE THE

03:39:57.817 --> 03:39:59.019
INITIATION OF THOSE CALLS FOR

03:39:59.085 --> 03:40:00.287
SERVICE AND I REALLY DISAGREE

03:40:00.353 --> 03:40:02.289
WITH THAT BECAUSE THE OFFICER

03:40:02.355 --> 03:40:03.557
THAT RESPONSE IS THE ONE WRITING

03:40:03.623 --> 03:40:04.591
THE REPORT NOT THE PERSON WHO

03:40:04.658 --> 03:40:05.525
MADE THE CALL.

03:40:05.592 --> 03:40:06.660
IF THE PERSON THAT MADE THE CALL

03:40:06.726 --> 03:40:07.727
WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE

03:40:07.794 --> 03:40:09.062
INFORMATION AND MAYBE THAT WOULD

03:40:09.129 --> 03:40:11.298
GO TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT

03:40:11.364 --> 03:40:12.832
THE MOTIVATION BEHIND --

03:40:12.899 --> 03:40:14.000
COLLECTING THESE REPORTS WHAT

03:40:14.067 --> 03:40:15.335
THE OFFICERS ARE NOT THE ONES

03:40:15.402 --> 03:40:16.670
INITIATING THIS THEY HAVE NO

03:40:16.736 --> 03:40:18.405
DISCRETION OVER THAT SO.

03:40:18.471 --> 03:40:20.140
I THINK WE NEED TO BALANCE THE

03:40:20.206 --> 03:40:22.309
COST OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING OUR

03:40:22.375 --> 03:40:23.176

TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

03:40:26.980 --> 03:40:27.914
AND I THINK THAT THAT CALCULUS

03:40:27.981 --> 03:40:29.749
IS DIFFERENT ON CALLS FOR

03:40:29.816 --> 03:40:32.018

FOR SERVICE I SUBMIT THAT THAT

03:40:48.335 --> 03:40:50.270
IS NOT A GOOD TRADE OFF AND NOT

03:40:50.337 --> 03:40:51.571
A GOOD USE OF OUR OFFICERS TIME

03:41:11.157 --> 03:41:12.459
JUST A LITTLE DISTURBING THAT

03:41:12.525 --> 03:41:14.294
SEEM LIKE EVERY CALL THAT WOULD

03:41:14.361 --> 03:41:15.629
STOP BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:41:15.695 --> 03:41:16.429
THERE WERE THERE WERE

03:41:16.496 --> 03:41:18.465
INDIVIDUALS THAT COMMITTED A

03:41:18.531 --> 03:41:20.634

03:41:25.238 --> 03:41:27.140
WE COULDN'T FIND A CALL.

03:41:27.207 --> 03:41:29.242
THAT IT WAS EVER MADE FOR THAT

03:41:29.309 --> 03:41:30.644
THERE WAS ANY SUSPICIOUS PERSON

03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:32.345
IN THE AREA SO I FIND THESE

03:41:32.412 --> 03:41:34.881
CALLS OR DOCUMENTING THIS REALLY

03:41:34.948 --> 03:41:36.282
REALLY IMPORTANT.

03:41:36.349 --> 03:41:37.450
SO THAT NOT ONLY WE CAN FERRET

03:41:37.517 --> 03:41:38.785

03:41:38.852 --> 03:41:39.719
BIAS.

03:41:39.786 --> 03:41:42.322
BUT IF THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE

03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:43.857
MAY HAVE BIAS.

03:41:43.923 --> 03:41:45.625
WE CAN FIND THAT OUT TOO AND

03:41:45.692 --> 03:41:47.060
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO

03:41:47.127 --> 03:41:48.928
DOCUMENT SO WE CAN FERRET OUT

03:41:48.995 --> 03:41:51.431

UNNECESSARY BY OF BIASES KILL

03:41:54.401 --> 03:41:55.769

YOU'RE PAYING. TO DOCUMENT IT

03:42:03.743 --> 03:42:05.445
JUST ONE LAWSUIT COULD

03:42:05.512 --> 03:42:06.846
ULTIMATELY WIPE OUT A WHOLE

03:42:06.913 --> 03:42:08.348

03:42:08.415 --> 03:42:09.249

03:42:09.315 --> 03:42:10.750
AND SO IF YOU TALK ABOUT COST

03:42:10.817 --> 03:42:13.353
BENEFIT ANALYSIS -- I I WOULD

03:42:13.420 --> 03:42:15.789

THE RIGHT THING.

03:42:28.635 --> 03:42:30.470
BUT THAT ONE PERSON REALLY

03:42:30.537 --> 03:42:33.640
REALLY -- IS PROBLEMATIC AT 1%

03:42:33.707 --> 03:42:35.375

DELIGHTED TO BE ASKED TO SPEAK

ON THIS BILL IT IS SO HEARTENING

03:47:19.392 --> 03:47:21.561
TO SEE A BILL THAT PRIORITIZES

03:47:21.627 --> 03:47:22.962
INCENTIVES.

03:47:23.029 --> 03:47:25.131
BECAUSE THIS IS EVIDENCE BASED I

03:47:25.198 --> 03:47:26.599
DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A STUDY

03:47:26.666 --> 03:47:29.902
YET THAT SHOWS AND THE OVERALL

03:47:29.969 --> 03:47:31.771
COLLABORATIVE COURTS HOW THIS

03:47:31.838 --> 03:47:32.438
WORKS.

03:47:32.505 --> 03:47:34.340
BUT WITH DRUG COURTS THERE'S A

03:47:34.407 --> 03:47:36.943
LONG BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT

03:47:37.010 --> 03:47:38.544
INCENTIVES WORK.

03:47:38.611 --> 03:47:39.912
IN FACT THEY WORK BETTER THAN

03:47:39.979 --> 03:47:43.316

03:47:43.383 --> 03:47:44.217

03:47:52.258 --> 03:47:54.093
SETTINGS INCENTIVES OR REWARDS

03:47:54.160 --> 03:47:56.329
EITHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE.

03:47:56.396 --> 03:47:58.297

03:48:08.141 --> 03:48:10.510
FORWARD IN TIME INCENTIVES HAVE

03:48:10.576 --> 03:48:12.011
BEEN SHOWN TO EFFECTIVELY

03:48:12.078 --> 03:48:14.013

VALUABLE REWARDS BECAUSE VALUE

03:48:35.068 --> 03:48:37.303
IS DETERMINED BY THE RECIPIENT

03:48:37.370 --> 03:48:38.671
DRUG COURT SHOULD ASK

03:48:38.738 --> 03:48:39.772
PARTICIPANTS WHAT THEY SHOULD

03:48:39.839 --> 03:48:40.139
LIVE.

03:48:40.206 --> 03:48:42.842
IN CALIFORNIA YOU CANNOT THINK

03:48:42.909 --> 03:48:44.777
OF A BETTER REWARD THAN

03:48:44.844 --> 03:48:46.479

03:49:27.954 --> 03:49:29.922
THE LONGER THE DELAY BETWEEN THE

03:49:29.989 --> 03:49:31.991
BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSE THE LESS

03:49:32.058 --> 03:49:33.459
EFFECTIVE THE INCENTIVE SO

03:49:33.526 --> 03:49:35.094

OF THE PROGRAM THE REWARDS IS

03:49:38.764 --> 03:49:41.100

DESPITE THESE ALARMING NUMBERS

03:54:26.819 --> 03:54:27.620
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS IS A

03:54:27.686 --> 03:54:30.256
CRIME WITH VIOLENCE AT ITS CORE.

03:54:30.322 --> 03:54:31.657

THEIR SENTENCE.

03:54:43.169 --> 03:54:44.170
THIS BILL WOULD RECOGNIZE THE

03:54:44.236 --> 03:54:45.805
MOST SERIOUS HUMAN TRAFFICKING

03:54:45.871 --> 03:54:47.473
OFFENSES AS A VIOLENT FELONY --

03:54:47.540 --> 03:54:48.741

INCLUDED IN THE SPECIFIED CRIMES

03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:51.577

THINK SOMETIMES WHERE WE NEED TO

START WITH THIS IS UNDERSTANDING

03:55:12.398 --> 03:55:13.632
WHAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS

03:55:13.699 --> 03:55:15.034
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES.

03:55:15.100 --> 03:55:17.436
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT IT IT

03:55:17.503 --> 03:55:21.040
TAKES IT'S THE MAJORITY OF CASES

03:55:21.106 --> 03:55:22.708
WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING ARE.

03:55:22.775 --> 03:55:23.976
STEMMING FROM VICTIMS ARE

03:55:24.043 --> 03:55:26.378
PROSTITUTES YOU HAVE WOMEN YOUNG

03:55:26.445 --> 03:55:28.380
WOMEN YOUNG MEN BUT THE MAJORITY

03:55:28.447 --> 03:55:29.682
OF THEM ARE WOMEN THAT HAVE NO

03:55:29.748 --> 03:55:31.183
OTHER WAY TO GO BUT ON TO THE

03:55:31.250 --> 03:55:32.518
STREETS THERE BECAUSE THEY START

03:55:32.585 --> 03:55:33.953
OUT FROM THE FOSTER HOMES.

03:55:34.019 --> 03:55:36.155
THEY ARE WORKING THEIR WAY

03:55:36.222 --> 03:55:37.656
THROUGH THEIR SYSTEM BECAUSE OF

03:55:37.723 --> 03:55:39.024
THE HORRIBLE CONDITIONS WITHIN

03:55:39.091 --> 03:55:40.826
THEIR OWN HOMES THEY AND OUT ON

03:55:40.893 --> 03:55:42.294
THE STREET WHERE THEY THEN

03:55:42.361 --> 03:55:43.896
BECOME VULNERABLE.

03:55:43.963 --> 03:55:45.931
TO A PIMP WHO THEN TURNS INTO A

03:55:45.998 --> 03:55:47.166
HUMAN TRAFFICKER SO WHAT IS THE

03:55:47.233 --> 03:55:48.501
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE THAT

03:55:48.567 --> 03:55:49.869
IS SIMPLY PUMPING THEM BECAUSE

03:55:49.935 --> 03:55:51.570
THEY WOEFULLY GO INTO WANTING TO

03:55:51.637 --> 03:55:53.539
DO THE SEX ACTS. TO THE PERSON

03:55:53.606 --> 03:55:54.907
THAT THAT BECOMES HUMAN

03:55:54.974 --> 03:55:56.375
TRAFFICKING AND THAT IS.

03:55:56.442 --> 03:55:58.811
VIOLENCE FORCE DURESS TO MAKE

03:55:58.878 --> 03:56:00.713
THEM DO THE SEX ACTS THAT THEY

03:56:00.779 --> 03:56:02.281
DO NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEY DO

03:56:02.348 --> 03:56:03.616
NOT WANT TO DO BUT THEY HAVE NO

03:56:03.682 --> 03:56:04.517
WAY OUT.

03:56:04.583 --> 03:56:06.785
THESE WOMEN ARE BEAT REPEATEDLY

03:56:06.852 --> 03:56:10.456
THEY ARE THREATENED THEY ARE --

03:56:10.523 --> 03:56:12.024
HURT THEY ARE.

03:56:12.091 --> 03:56:13.325
FORCED TO DO THINGS THAT THEY

03:56:13.392 --> 03:56:15.761
DON'T WANT TO DO AND IT IS A

03:56:15.828 --> 03:56:17.863
REPETITIVE LIFESTYLE THAT THEY

03:56:17.930 --> 03:56:19.298
HAVE NO CHOICE.

03:56:19.365 --> 03:56:20.933
FOR THE REASON THAT I BRING THIS

03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:24.136
UP IS BECAUSE IT IS VIOLENT AT

03:56:24.203 --> 03:56:26.272
ITS VERY CORE IT IS VIOLENT SO

03:56:26.338 --> 03:56:28.974
WOMEN THAT ARE PROSTITUTES A YOU.

03:56:29.041 --> 03:56:31.410
YEARS AGO USED TO SAY OR NOT WE

03:56:31.477 --> 03:56:32.678
BUT THEY USED TO BE SO IT'S A

03:56:32.745 --> 03:56:34.446
VICTIMLESS CRIME NOBODY CARES

03:56:34.513 --> 03:56:36.382
AND I AND I SEE THE GREAT

03:56:36.448 --> 03:56:37.716
STRIDES THAT WE'VE MADE.

03:56:37.783 --> 03:56:39.285
IN SOCIETY AND IN CALIFORNIA

03:56:39.351 --> 03:56:41.053
SPECIFICALLY WITH ALL THE NEW

03:56:41.120 --> 03:56:42.555
LAWS TO HELP VICTIMS OF HUMAN

03:56:42.621 --> 03:56:44.590
TRAFFICKING BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO

03:56:44.657 --> 03:56:46.158
HELP THEM IF WE CAN'T STOP THE

03:56:46.225 --> 03:56:48.527
CYCLE SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS.

03:56:48.594 --> 03:56:51.063
IT IN JUST IN THE TWO THOUSAND

03:56:51.130 --> 03:56:51.864
FIFTEEN STUDY FROM SAN DIEGO

03:56:51.931 --> 03:56:53.532
COUNTY THERE EIGHT THOUSAND

03:56:53.599 --> 03:56:56.969
HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ONLY

03:56:57.036 --> 03:56:57.603
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EVEN

03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:58.671
REPORTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:56:58.737 --> 03:57:00.105
THERE'S A REASON WHY THOSE

03:57:00.172 --> 03:57:01.540
NUMBERS ARE SO STAGGERING.

03:57:01.607 --> 03:57:03.442
AND IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK

03:57:03.509 --> 03:57:05.311
OF TRUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:57:05.377 --> 03:57:06.612
THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST WITH

03:57:06.679 --> 03:57:08.280
DEALING WITH THE SYSTEM WHY

03:57:08.347 --> 03:57:09.815
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE

03:57:09.882 --> 03:57:11.517
PERSON THAT HAS THAT CONTROL AND

03:57:11.584 --> 03:57:13.385
THAT THEY ARE SO AFRAID OF FOR

03:57:13.452 --> 03:57:14.520
THEIR LIVES.

03:57:14.587 --> 03:57:16.088
WILL TURN AROUND AND BE RIGHT

03:57:16.155 --> 03:57:17.990
BACK OUT ON THE STREET IT TAKES

03:57:18.057 --> 03:57:20.292
A LOT OF TIME IT TAKES A LOT OF

03:57:20.359 --> 03:57:24.263
A COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH -- THE

03:57:24.330 --> 03:57:25.097
THESE WOMEN. TO GET TO KNOW THEM

03:57:25.164 --> 03:57:26.265
FOR THEM TO TRUST US AND THEN

03:57:26.332 --> 03:57:28.033
ONCE THAT.

03:57:28.100 --> 03:57:29.768
TRUST IS RECEIVED.

03:57:29.835 --> 03:57:31.370
THEN TO TRY TO PROSECUTE AND

03:57:31.437 --> 03:57:32.504
THEY'RE TURNING AROUND AND

03:57:32.571 --> 03:57:34.073
COMING RIGHT BACK OUT WITHOUT

03:57:34.139 --> 03:57:34.840
HAVING TO SERVE THEIR FIRST

03:57:34.907 --> 03:57:36.675
SENTENCES AND THAT IS THE THE

03:57:36.742 --> 03:57:38.877
REASON FOR THE NEED FOR THE

03:57:38.944 --> 03:57:39.545
SPELL.

03:57:39.612 --> 03:57:41.847
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS I'VE HEARD

03:57:41.914 --> 03:57:43.482
A LOT OF THINGS TODAY ABOUT

03:57:43.549 --> 03:57:45.551
DIFFERENT THINGS OF -- REFORM IN

03:57:45.618 --> 03:57:47.553
THE PRISON SYSTEMS AND ALL OF

03:57:47.620 --> 03:57:48.687
THAT IS GOOD AND THERE ARE MANY

03:57:48.754 --> 03:57:50.689
TYPES OF OTHER -- LAWS AND

03:57:50.756 --> 03:57:52.424
PROPOSITIONS WHEN PEOPLE ARE NO

03:57:52.491 --> 03:57:54.093
LONGER THREATS OR WHEN THEY HAVE

03:57:54.159 --> 03:57:55.594
REFORMED BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING

03:57:55.661 --> 03:57:56.962
AND IT IS REPEATEDLY HAPPENING

03:57:57.029 --> 03:57:58.297
AND I'M HEARING ABOUT IT UP AND

03:57:58.364 --> 03:57:59.765
DOWN THE THE STATE.

03:57:59.832 --> 03:58:01.834
AT DIFFERENT CONFERENCES THAT I

03:58:01.900 --> 03:58:03.135
ATTEND.

03:58:03.202 --> 03:58:04.837
THEY ARE STILL CONTROLLING THEY

03:58:04.903 --> 03:58:06.639
THE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS ARE STILL

03:58:06.705 --> 03:58:08.774
CONTROLLING THEIR VICTIMS FROM

03:58:08.841 --> 03:58:11.010
AND PRESENT THEY ARE STILL

03:58:11.076 --> 03:58:12.745
GETTING THAT CONTROL THEY'RE

03:58:12.811 --> 03:58:14.079
REACHING OUT TO THEM THEY ARE.

03:58:14.146 --> 03:58:15.881
COURSING THAN THEY ARE STILL

03:58:15.948 --> 03:58:16.715
HAVING THEM THEY'RE LIVING IN

03:58:16.782 --> 03:58:18.517
FEAR AND SO WHY WOULD YOU

03:58:18.584 --> 03:58:21.120
COOPERATE WORD ON THE STREET IS

03:58:21.186 --> 03:58:23.155
NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

03:58:23.222 --> 03:58:25.190
MANY LARGER COUNTIES ARE EVEN --

03:58:25.257 --> 03:58:26.859
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T.

03:58:26.925 --> 03:58:28.293
IT'S VERY HARD TO WIN THE HUMAN

03:58:28.360 --> 03:58:29.728
TRAFFICKING CASE IF YOU HAVE ONE

03:58:29.795 --> 03:58:32.998
VICTIM BUT IF YOU HAVE TWENTY

03:58:33.065 --> 03:58:34.800
THAT IS VERY INVOLVED IN HUMAN

03:58:34.867 --> 03:58:35.768
TRAFFICKING.

03:58:35.834 --> 03:58:36.402
THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL

03:58:36.468 --> 03:58:37.903
PUNISHMENTS FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL

03:58:37.970 --> 03:58:39.071
VICTIMS AS WELL.

03:58:39.138 --> 03:58:40.239
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WORKS

03:58:40.305 --> 03:58:42.307
TELLING A HUMAN TRAFFIC VICTIM

03:58:42.374 --> 03:58:43.776
IS.

03:58:43.842 --> 03:58:45.711
YES WE ARE SORRY THIS HAPPENED

03:58:45.778 --> 03:58:47.046
TO YOU BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU

03:58:47.112 --> 03:58:48.981
AS A VIOLENT.

03:58:49.048 --> 03:58:50.149
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT'S BEING

03:58:50.215 --> 03:58:51.950
SENT AT THAT IS NOT ADDED -- TO

03:58:52.017 --> 03:58:53.252
IT BE CONSIDERED A VIOLENT

03:58:53.318 --> 03:58:54.620
FELONY AS WELL.

03:58:54.687 --> 03:58:56.488
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

03:58:56.555 --> 03:58:57.189
THANK YOU.

03:58:57.256 --> 03:58:59.224
YES BRIEFLY MISS CHAIR MEMBERS

03:58:59.291 --> 03:59:01.026
RYAN CHARMER WITH THE RIVERSIDE

03:59:01.093 --> 03:59:02.695
SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION -- I ALSO

03:59:02.761 --> 03:59:04.463
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OPPONENTS

03:59:04.530 --> 03:59:06.165
OF THE BILL HAVE ARGUED THAT

03:59:06.231 --> 03:59:07.533
CURRENT CRIMINAL PENALTIES ARE

03:59:07.599 --> 03:59:08.434
ADEQUATELY.

03:59:08.500 --> 03:59:10.302
HARSH AND THEREFORE THERE'S NO

03:59:10.369 --> 03:59:13.472
NEED -- TO STRENGTHEN THE

03:59:13.539 --> 03:59:15.007
PENALTIES -- ADDITIONALLY THEY

03:59:15.074 --> 03:59:16.742
THEY CLAIM THAT THERE'S SHOULD

03:59:16.809 --> 03:59:18.911
BE THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN

03:59:18.977 --> 03:59:20.846
THE DETERRENT EFFECT -- BY

03:59:20.913 --> 03:59:22.281
INCREASING -- THAT THESE

03:59:22.347 --> 03:59:24.483
PENALTIES AND WE WOULD STRONGLY

03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:26.452
DISAGREE WITH THAT -- WE THINK

03:59:26.518 --> 03:59:29.088
THAT -- IF SOMEBODY IS CONVICTED

03:59:29.154 --> 03:59:30.589
AND IS GOING AWAY FOR A LOT

03:59:30.656 --> 03:59:34.593
LONGER -- THEN CURRENTLY --

03:59:34.660 --> 03:59:35.928
THERE'S A 1100%.

03:59:35.994 --> 03:59:37.963
A SPECIFIC DETERRENTS FOR THAT

03:59:38.030 --> 03:59:39.031
ONE INDIVIDUAL.

03:59:39.098 --> 03:59:40.699
AND WE WOULD BELIEVE THAT IF

03:59:40.766 --> 03:59:42.534
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT OUT

03:59:42.601 --> 03:59:44.336
ON THE STREET ACTIVELY --

03:59:44.403 --> 03:59:45.971
ENGAGING -- IN THEIR OTHER

03:59:46.038 --> 03:59:48.040
ACTIVITIES THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO

03:59:48.107 --> 03:59:49.575
MAKE PHONE CALLS AND THEY MIGHT

03:59:49.641 --> 03:59:51.343
BE ABLE TO SEND NOTES BACK AND

03:59:51.410 --> 03:59:52.678
FORTH BUT THEY WOULDN'T

03:59:52.745 --> 03:59:54.780
PHYSICALLY BE OUT THERE -- BEING

03:59:54.847 --> 03:59:56.315
INVOLVED IN THE SAME HORRENDOUS

03:59:56.381 --> 03:59:58.717
CRIMES AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE

03:59:58.784 --> 03:59:59.284

WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEAN UNDER

04:00:05.624 --> 04:00:06.725
WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PEACE

04:00:06.792 --> 04:00:08.360
OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT

04:00:08.427 --> 04:00:09.728
THANK YOU.

04:00:09.795 --> 04:00:20.372
ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

04:00:20.439 --> 04:00:20.639
THANK YOU.

04:00:20.706 --> 04:00:22.841
THANKS.

04:00:22.908 --> 04:00:24.109
GOOD AFTERNOON.

04:00:24.176 --> 04:00:26.245
KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU

04:00:26.311 --> 04:00:28.447
OF CALIFORNIA -- I THINK AGAIN

04:00:28.514 --> 04:00:29.648
AND AGAIN THIS COMMITTEE HEARS

04:00:29.715 --> 04:00:31.416
TESTIMONY ON BILLS THAT ARE

04:00:31.483 --> 04:00:33.152
ABOUT SOME CRIME THAT IS

04:00:33.218 --> 04:00:35.087
HAPPENING THAT THAT AND I THINK

04:00:35.154 --> 04:00:37.356
THAT WE ALL AGREE THEIR TERRIBLE

04:00:37.422 --> 04:00:40.359
CRIMES -- AND THEN THE BILL

04:00:40.425 --> 04:00:42.461
LOGICAL ARGUMENT IS THAT BY

04:00:42.528 --> 04:00:44.163
INCREASING THE PENALTY FOR THIS

04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:46.565
CRIME -- WE WILL SOMEHOW STOP IT

04:00:46.632 --> 04:00:47.599
OR AT LEAST PREVENT SOME

04:00:47.666 --> 04:00:49.635
INSTANCES OF IT FROM HAPPENING

04:00:49.701 --> 04:00:51.770
AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT THAT JUST

04:00:51.837 --> 04:00:54.139
ISN'T TRUE WE WE KNOW THAT

04:00:54.206 --> 04:00:56.875
INCREASING PENALTIES -- HAS HAS

04:00:56.942 --> 04:00:58.977
NO DETERRENT EFFECT AND I THINK

04:00:59.044 --> 04:01:00.245
THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN

04:01:00.312 --> 04:01:01.346
WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE

04:01:01.413 --> 04:01:03.048
HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH IS

04:01:03.115 --> 04:01:04.850
ALREADY SEVERELY PUNISHED UNDER

04:01:04.917 --> 04:01:06.785
EXISTING LAW THE LOWEST PENALTY

04:01:06.852 --> 04:01:08.320
UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR HUMAN

04:01:08.387 --> 04:01:09.755
TRAFFICKING.

04:01:09.822 --> 04:01:11.423
IS FIVE YEARS IN STATE PRISON --

04:01:11.490 --> 04:01:13.292
AND THE PUNISHMENT IN SOME CASES

04:01:13.358 --> 04:01:14.960
CAN BE LIFE IN PRISON AND THE

04:01:15.027 --> 04:01:16.195
INCREASE PRISON TIME RESULTING

04:01:16.261 --> 04:01:17.529
FROM MAKING THIS A VIOLENT

04:01:17.596 --> 04:01:19.064
FELONY AND A STRIKE WILL DO

04:01:19.131 --> 04:01:20.799
NOTHING TO FURTHER THAT THAT

04:01:20.866 --> 04:01:23.702
DETER THE CRIME -- I ALSO WANT

04:01:23.769 --> 04:01:25.037
TO POINT OUT THAT THE HUMAN

04:01:25.103 --> 04:01:26.872
TRAFFICKING WAS SPECIFICALLY

04:01:26.939 --> 04:01:29.208
RAISED IN ARGUMENTS AGAINST PROP

04:01:29.274 --> 04:01:30.542
FIFTY SEVEN AS TO WHY THAT THAT

04:01:30.609 --> 04:01:31.844
PROPOSITION SHOULD NOT BE

04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:32.544
ENACTED.

04:01:32.611 --> 04:01:33.912
AND THE VOTERS APPROVED THE

04:01:33.979 --> 04:01:35.314
MEASURE HAVING HEARD THOSE

04:01:35.380 --> 04:01:37.349
ARGUMENTS THE VOTERS UNDERSTOOD

04:01:37.416 --> 04:01:38.817
THAT THE CHOICE THEY WERE MAKING

04:01:38.884 --> 04:01:40.185
WAS WHAT WAS NEEDED TO FOR THAT

04:01:40.252 --> 04:01:42.187
THIS STATE TO MOVE AWAY FROM

04:01:42.254 --> 04:01:45.257
OVER INCARCERATION AND EVER

04:01:45.324 --> 04:01:46.692
INCREASING PRISON COSTS.

04:01:46.758 --> 04:01:48.760
ON THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT BE

04:01:48.827 --> 04:01:51.830
GOING BACK ON THAT CHOICE.

04:01:51.897 --> 04:01:53.665
WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE.

04:01:53.732 --> 04:01:54.700
MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA

04:01:54.766 --> 04:01:57.936
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION --

04:01:58.003 --> 04:02:00.606
I WOULD ECHO MISS YEARS COMMENTS.

04:02:00.672 --> 04:02:02.641
BUT I GUESS SOME ALSO PARTIALLY

04:02:02.708 --> 04:02:05.143
PUZZLED BY THIS BECAUSE I'M

04:02:05.210 --> 04:02:06.645
HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

04:02:06.712 --> 04:02:10.115
OF A MINOR WITH TO REST ON IS A

04:02:10.182 --> 04:02:12.851
LIFE SENTENCE IS FIFTEEN TO LIFE.

04:02:12.918 --> 04:02:16.955
AND BY DEFINITION OR LAID OUT IN

04:02:17.022 --> 04:02:18.624
SIX SIX SEVEN POINT FIVE OF THE

04:02:18.690 --> 04:02:21.560
OFFENSES THAT ARE VIOLENT

04:02:21.627 --> 04:02:23.729
FELONIES IS ANY OFFENSE THAT IS

04:02:23.795 --> 04:02:26.231
PUNISHABLE BY LIFE IN PRISON.

04:02:26.298 --> 04:02:28.734
SO THIS THAT PART OF THIS IS

04:02:28.800 --> 04:02:31.670
ALREADY -- A VIOLENT FELONYIT'S

04:02:31.737 --> 04:02:34.039
ALREADY A STRIKE IT'S NOT AN

04:02:34.106 --> 04:02:34.406
ISSUE.

04:02:34.473 --> 04:02:40.545
ON THE OTHER PARTS OF OF THE TWO

04:02:40.612 --> 04:02:42.547
THIRTY SIX POINT.

04:02:42.614 --> 04:02:44.449
ONE WHICH IS -- WHAT THEY SEEK

04:02:44.516 --> 04:02:47.386
TO MAKE A VIOLENT FELONY?

04:02:47.452 --> 04:02:50.923
IS PUNISHABLE -- EITHER BY FIVE

04:02:50.989 --> 04:02:52.391
EIGHT OR TWELVE YEARS IN STATE

04:02:52.457 --> 04:02:53.258
PRISON.

04:02:53.325 --> 04:02:57.162
OR EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN OR TWENTY

04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:58.797
YEARS IN STATE PRISON.

04:02:58.864 --> 04:03:00.299
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

04:03:00.365 --> 04:03:02.467
BODY OF EVIDENCE ANYWHERE THAT

04:03:02.534 --> 04:03:05.103
POSITS THAT FURTHER PRISON TIME

04:03:05.170 --> 04:03:07.806
IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

04:03:07.873 --> 04:03:09.541
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE YOUNG

04:03:09.608 --> 04:03:11.310
MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE FORCED

04:03:11.376 --> 04:03:12.644
INTO THE SLIGHT.

04:03:12.711 --> 04:03:14.579
AND I THINK THAT THE RESOURCES

04:03:14.646 --> 04:03:16.648
THAT WOULD BE DEVOTED TO

04:03:16.715 --> 04:03:19.284
INCARCERATING MORE PEOPLE NEED

04:03:19.351 --> 04:03:21.320
TO BE PUT TOWARDS.

04:03:21.386 --> 04:03:23.188
PREVENTION THEY NEED TO THERE

04:03:23.255 --> 04:03:25.657
NEEDS TO BE SHELTERS FOR RUN

04:03:25.724 --> 04:03:27.392
AWAYS THERE NEED TO BE MENTAL

04:03:27.459 --> 04:03:28.760
HEALTH COUNSELING.

04:03:28.827 --> 04:03:30.896
THERE NEED TO BE PLACES FOR

04:03:30.963 --> 04:03:32.831
CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO

04:03:32.898 --> 04:03:37.035
OVER AND VIEWS OF SITUATIONS --

04:03:37.102 --> 04:03:38.870
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

04:03:38.937 --> 04:03:41.907
THE RESOURCES GO TO SO WE WOULD

04:03:41.974 --> 04:03:43.175

MINOR SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

VIOLENT FELONY I THINK IT'S ALSO

04:04:08.000 --> 04:04:09.468
A VIOLENT ACT -- WHEN IT'S

04:04:09.534 --> 04:04:10.969
