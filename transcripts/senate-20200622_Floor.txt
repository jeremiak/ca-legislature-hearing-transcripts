HE HAD L. ET AT LEAST POLICY LIMIT IT FOR ME THEIR HOUSE THE ONLY WITHOUT SUBMITTING A LENGTHY IN A MASSIVE INVENTORY OF ONE'S BELONGINGS IT ALSO PROVIDES A SIXTY DAY GRACE PERIOD FOR PREMIUM PAYMENT IN THE EVENT OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY. BUT FOR A CLARIFIED. WHEN AN INSURED CHOOSES TO PURCHASE A HOME RATHER THAN REBUILD THAT THE INSURER CANNOT DEDUCT THE LAND VALUE FOR THE PRICE OF THE NEW HOME FROM THE AMOUNT THAT THEY PAY THE INSURER. PROVIDING THESE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS OF RESIDENTIAL GE INSURANCE PROPERTIES WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF AND SAFEGUARDS TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I.

DOES THIS BILL AUTOMATICALLY SEND THOSE POLICIES FOR THIRTY SIX MONTHS WILL PREMIUM BE INVOLVED FOR THE ADDITIONAL TIME FRAME OTHER THAN THE TWELVE MONTHS I'M JUST CARE ABOUT THAT. SIR DOLLARS LIKE TO RESPOND TO JUST SUMMARIZE THAT QUESTION AGAIN AND A YEAR TO TALK ABOUT AN EXTENSION OF THE OF THE POLICY. YES SIR. SAID I DON'T REALLY GET A POLICY FOR TWELVE MONTHS ON YOUR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE. UNDERSTANDING IS BASED ON THE DOCK THE PAPER THAT I HAVE A FRIEND IN ME IS THE D. BILL WOULD INCREASE IT FOR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY SIX MEN. OR IS IT SOMETHING SEPARATE WELL MY GUESS I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IS THE PREMIUM THE PREMIUM WOULD BE THE PREMIUM THAT THEY HAD BEFORE YOUR PRIOR TO IN THE ORIGINAL POLICY OKAY THANK YOU SIR. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS COURSE ON THE SIDE ON. XENON SENATOR DODD WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. YES MISTER PRESIDENT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL- FOR A FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS- NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING. IN A IN A FIRE YOU'RE STARTING ALL OVER HIM WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INSTANCES IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT THAT REALLY STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN- WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO COULD SOON.

SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY THREE BY SENATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO JURIES. SYNERGY ACTION THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THIS MEASURE IT EXTENDS THE SUNSET DATE ON A LAW THAT REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES AFFORDED IN MISDEMEANOR TRIALS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES AND ALLOW ONE ATTORNEY TO DISMISS A JUROR WITHOUT GIVING ANY REASON. THE CALIFORNIA LAW LIMITS NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES A TWO SIX IN CRIMINAL TRIALS IN FELONY AND MISDEMEANOR TRIALS IN FELONIES IT'S A LARGER NUMBER AND OF COURSE IN DEATH PENALTY CASES OF TWICE THAT NUMBER. THE BILL ARE WILL ALLOW AN EXTENSION OF THE SUNSET FOR THREE YEARS IT IS SPONSORING BY THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES. SUPPORTED BY BOTH THE ASSOCIATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND THE CALIFORNIA LET JUDGES ASSOCIATION ARE YOU STILL THERE TRONG THAT THE REDUCE NUMBER BRENT CHALLENGES FOR ALL TO MORE. YOU WERE JURORS I NEED TO BE SUMMONED TO SERVE IN A JURY POOL WHEN THE NUMBER OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES DECREASES. NOW LET US LOOK AT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY. WHERE THE COURTS HAVE SUSPENDED CRIMINAL TRIALS IN FACT ALL TRIALS AND WHEN IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET JURORS. IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO COME IN TO ANSWER A JURY SUMMONS THE JURY ROOMS ARE SMALL. ARE THEY ARE USUALLY FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH PEOPLE SO THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE EVEN UNDER A GOOD SITUATION- IN MY OWN COUNTY THEY ARE TRYING TO DO A CRIMINAL JURY TRIAL- SENATE BILL FIVE HUNDRED REQUEST FOR JUROR. AND GO BACK UP. WHAT TO SERVE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME SO NOT TRUST IN TERMS OF THE EFFICIENCIES OF THE SYSTEM BUT AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT AS WELL- THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BY OUR COURTS SO WE HAVE IT THE NUMBER OF JUDGES WHO SUPPORT THIS I MENTIONED TO. IT IS A IT IS SUPPORTED SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION IT HAS THE SUPPORT OF VIRTUALLY EVERY PRESIDING JUDGE IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA- THIS IS A MEASURE THAT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS. OF AN INCH THERE ONCE THIS HAS BEEN IN PLACE ARE THERE HAS TO BE A CHALLENGE OR ANY OBJECTION FILED A TO THE USE OF SIX PEREMPTORIES AND- WITH THAT I WOULD REQUEST THAT WE CONTINUE THAT SUNSET FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS- AS WE WORK THROUGH THE CURRENT CRISIS. AND AS WE- TRY TO BE MORE. EFFICIENT IN THE PROCESS OF JOBS THIS WHICH THESE JUDGES OF COURSE ARE THE SINGULAR INDEPENDENT ARBITER NEED FOR PROSECUTORS NOR DEFENSE ATTORNEY THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE. HOME TO AND IN REQUIRED TO DISPENSE JUSTICE MOST FAIRLY AND INDEPENDENTLY IT IS THERE A MEASURE THAT THEY HAD ASKED ME TO- PRESENT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ACTUALLY USE PEREMPTORIES BEFORE WE TRY TO LIMIT THE USES ALL OF THEM- RARELY IF EVER DO WE USE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT IT IS STRATEGICALLY VERY BAD THING TO DO. AND WHEN WE HAVE SIX PEREMPTORIES WE USUALLY SEE ARCHER ATTORNEYS USING FOR THE WHEN WE HIT YOU STEP CAN THEY NEVER USED THE TENTS SO- THIS HAS WORKED AND THE JUDGES WOULD TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. THAT WE CONTINUE WITH THAT SUNSET AN EXTENDED FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS WITH THAT I WOULD ASK THREE RIFLE. THANK YOU DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN THIRTY THREE- AND I DO SO AS SOME OF THE PRACTICE LAW FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND- CONDUCTED- FIFTEEN- JURY TRIALS- THEY WERE NOT CRIMINAL THEY WERE CIVIL- BUT I'VE- I PICTURE IS AND I'VE SEEN THE GOOD AND THE BAD AND THE UGLY ABOUT HOW JURIES ARE SELECTED. ON AS A AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY I ALWAYS LOVED PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES BECAUSE IT GAVE ME A SENSE THAT I HAD SOME SORT OF CONTROL HOWEVER I LEARNED OVER TIME THAT THESE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ACTUALLY DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT MUCH CONTROL BECAUSE PRESS THREE CHALLENGE DURING HER EARLY BASED ON. STEREOTYPES PEOPLE. AND I'D BEEN TALK THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WOULD STAY SOMEONE. OF A JURY AND FIND OUT LATER THAT THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T REALLY SYMPATHETIC RIGHT DIDN'T STRIKE SOMEONE AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THEY WERE A NIGHTMARE FOR ME- ON THE JURY- AND SO WE END UP REALLY USING A LOT OF STEREOTYPES ON WHEN WE EXERCISE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. THEY DO HAVE VALUE BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN JUDGES- MAKE MISTAKES- WHEN A JUDGE SAID EXCUSE SOMEONE- FOR BECAUSE AND DOESN'T. AND THAT'S WHY THEY EXISTS AND SALAS THIS BILL IS TAKING ON. HI I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL STRIKES A GOOD. BALANCE BY RETAINING PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES- BUT ALLOWING THEM TO MASS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE- AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THEY ARE NOT AS VALUABLE. AS SOME PEOPLE SOMETIMES BELIEVE- SO I ALSO AS FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THAT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WITH ALL TO TAKE A QUESTION CERTAINLY SO- DAY THE NOTES THAT I HAVE INDICATE THAT. THAT THE. THE SPONSORS MAY BE TAKING AN AMENDMENT OR SUGGESTING AN AMENDMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY TO MAKE IT ONE YEAR SO I JUST WANTED TO CHECK- WITH YOU WHETHER THAT'S THE CASE OR NOT. IF THAT IS THE CASE SECTION TO ME. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE- THE REASON THAT I AYE RISES BECAUSE- I DID CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND SO I HAD. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY HUNDREDS OF JURY TRIALS THAT I PARTICIPATED IN A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE DOING CRIMINAL OFFENSE WORK- PEOPLE GENERALLY THINK OF THAT WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSED OF A CRIME. THAT WHERE THERE'S SMOKE. THERE'S A FIRE AND SO WAS PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT AND- AND- I WANT TO DISAGREE WITH MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO- IT MAY BE THAT SOME OTHER PEOPLE USES USE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES- IN A BIASED WAY. QUITE FRANKLY I LOOKED AT THE BODY LANGUAGE I WANTED TO SEE WHO WASN'T GONNA LOOK ME IN THE EYE ARE WHO WORKS IN A LOOK AT MY CLIENT. OR BOB LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE READ WHAT- MY CLIENT WAS CHARGED WITH AND SO THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES WERE WERE VERY VERY IMPORTANT IF IN FACT THIS BILL IS ON AND I'M AND I'M SO I WAS PREPARED NOT TO SUPPORT THE BILL BUT- IF IT'S- REPORT. A TIME OF A PANDEMIC THEN I AM ALL FOR THAT AND SO IF IT IF IT IF THE BILL WOULD BE TO EXTEND THE SUNSET FOR A YEAR OR MAYBE TWO YEARS THAT MAKE SENSE TO ME BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS JUST A- BY THE COURTS TO JUST NOT HAVE. TO DO. TO HAVE THE JURY TRIAL. SAYS TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE INCONVENIENT FOR THE FOR THE JUDGES- AND SO I'M GOING TO BE LAYING OFF AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME I THINK IT'S- IT'S A GOOD THING TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THIS CORONA VIRUS WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE COMING IN IF WE PAY FOR YOUR FOR YOUR- DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR JURORS BUT I'M JUST IT. THREE YEARS TO ME SEEMS- EXCESSIVE IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION SO I RESPECT THE- WILL NOT BE VOTING. DO YOU. KNOW DISCUSSION ORDERED. ON THIS ITEM SEEING NO OTHER MICROPHONES CENTER JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IS THANK YOU I HAVE TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE NUMBER OF PRESIDING JUDGES THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED IN OF SPENT A LIFE COMMITTED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE FAIRLY IMPARTIALLY AND WITHOUT FAVOR TO EITHER SIDE. OUR SHOWS A CROSS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS PROVED EFFECTIVE PRODUCTIVE IN TERMS OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. IT IS A PROCESS BILL I THINK A IF AND IF ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY ONLY TWO STATES IN THE COUNTRY. THAT ALLOW FOR MORE PEREMPTORY PUNCHES THEN WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS EXCUSE FOR CALLS AND THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES AS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY POINTED OUT. WE WERE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO LOOK TO OR YOUR CLIENT UPSIDE DOWN AND INSIDE OUT AND YOU GET TO USE THEM FOR COST. TO RENT TO REACH YOU GET TO EXCLUSION FOR ANY YOU. OUR WHICH MEANS THAT YOU TO BE IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER YOU'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CLEAR. AND AS MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO SAID SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE ROLLING DICE. THEN USING A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE YOU THINK SOMEONE ISN'T GOING TO BE A GOOD. JUROR FOR YOU TURNS OUT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT TEACHER. BUT LIMITING THIS TO SIX I IS SOMETHING THAT AS I MENTIONED I COULD TO LIST OFF ALL THE- OPERAS IN JUDGING. ARE IN BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ALL OF THEM SUPPORT THIS MEASURE I TRUST IN TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. BUT IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF JUSTICE AND AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE YET TO SEE SINGLE.

SENATE BILL TWELVE AU SEVEN BY SNATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH FACILITIES SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU MISTRESS AND COLLEAGUES ARE AS PART OF THE WILDFIRE TASK FORCE WE WERE ATTACHED TO LOOK- TO SEE HOW OUR MOST VULNERABLE. WERE HANDLING THE PS PS SITUATION AND OUR WILDFIRES AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS THAT EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THESE FACILITIES ARE FEDERALLY- LICENSED WITH THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE NINETY SIX HOURS OF BACK UP ELECTRICITY SO THAT THEY CAN CARE FOR. THEIR VULNERABLE- POPULATION- THERE IS STILL A PERCENTAGE. OF CALIFORNIA LICENSE COMPANIES THAT DO NOT PROVIDE THAT NINETY SIX HOURS IN FACT THEY ONLY PROVIDE SIX HOURS. NOW EVEN IN THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE FEDERALLY LICENSED THERE IS A QUESTION. OF AMONGST THOSE FEDERAL- FACILITIES THE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAS ALREADY- FOR INDICATED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS TO OVERSEE THEM. I INDICATED IN A REPORT A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT EVEN ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THESE REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT BEING MET AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT REQUIRES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO APPLY AND TO INCORPORATE THAT FEDERAL MANDATE INTO STATE LAW AND OUR HOPE IS OF COURSE THAT WILL START SEEING THIS BETTER IMPLEMENTED WHEN YOU THINK OF THE WHEN WE HAVE A P. S. P. S. AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY P. JEANNIE IN PARTICULAR. TO EXPECT MANY MORE OF THEM WHEN WE THINK OF THE SITUATION IN THE IN THE COVERT REALITY IN WHICH WE LIVE AND THE FACT THAT IT'S DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY EVAC BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE WHEN THERE IS A FIRE OR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR MEDICATIONS PROTECTED. OXYGEN AVAILABLE TO THEM THE OTHER THINGS THAT THESE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO SURVIVE THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES IT REALLY- JUST EXPANDS THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO NINETY SIX HOURS- SO THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE THROES OF THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CURRENT PANDEMIC. BUT ALSO WHO IN MANY INSTANCES WHETHER IT'S WILDFIRES TO WE THEY ARE PROJECTED FOR THESE P. S. P. S. IS. NOT HEARD TELL OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY NEED TRUST TO BE ABLE TO SERVE FIVE WITHIN SOCIAL. HAVING AVAILABLE TO THEM THAT IMPORTANT ELECTRICITY TO HELP KEEP THEM ALIVE AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THE FOR THE STATION SENATOR OF. AN MR FOR. I RISE IN OF THE BILL I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT TIME WE REALIZE THAT EVEN WITH COATED AND THE P. S. P. S. SITUATIONS THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY ESPECIALLY WITH THE KOBE SITUATION HAVE BEEN. THE MOST ELDERLY AND WAS FRAIL INDIVIDUALS IN SOCIETY THAT ARE SEE IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THESE FACILITIES ARE REGULATED AND LICENSED BY THE STATE I KNOW IN MY COUNTY AND KERN COUNTY OVER LOST THEIR LIVES BECAUSE A KOBE CAME FROM ONE FACILITY ONE PARTICULAR FACILITY. SO IT IS VERY DISTURBING TO THINK THAT ARE MOST ELDERLY AND MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY OR NOT BEING CARED FOR IN THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD I THINK THE SENATORS BILL WILL- AT IT AS A PROTECTION SO THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE A P. S. P. S. SITUATION AND THEY DO HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON OXYGEN AND OTHER. FORMS OF LIFE SUSTAINING AND MEDICATIONS AND STUFF THAT THEY WOULD FIRST. I GUESS APPARATUSES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE SECURE AT LEAST UNTIL POWER IS RESTORED BUT I'D ALSO LIKE YOU GUYS MY COLLEAGUES THINK ABOUT THE A STRAIN ON SOME OF THESE FACILITIES YOU KNOW WE'VE PASS MANDATES OVER THE YEARS FOR INCREASED A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE COSTS BUT YET MEDICARE RATES A REIMBURSEMENT RATES HAVE GONE DOWN. SOME OF US WHEN WE HAVE OUR APPEARANCE OR INDIVIDUALS INSIDE OF SOME OF THESE CARE FACILITIES THEIR PRIVATE FACILITIES WHERE YOU PAY ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FIRST FOR CARE AND QUALITY CARE I KNOW THAT MY MOM DIED OF DEMENTIA WE HAD- IN A FACILITY FOR THE LAST THIRTY DAYS OR SO OVER LIFE. SHE LIVES I SAID PRIOR TO THAT IT SUBSTANTIAL EVERY MONTH THE PAYMENT BUT SHE GOT GOOD CARE BUT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE FACILITIES THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THERE ARE REGULATED BY THE STATE. ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICAID OR MEDICARE AND REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS VERY VERY LOW SOMEONE INCREASE EVERY PASSED THIS BUILDING THAT INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS THE NOT AFFECTS DIRECT PATIENT CARE THIS IS ISN'T IT. COST MANDATE WOULD BE HIS FIRST. FOR CHEN BACK. AGAIN IS THE- RATE FOR THE MEDIC READ. WHICH IS EXTREMELY LOW SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. BUT I DO HOLY SUPPORT THE BILL TO ALLOW AND A GENERATOR TO BE PLACED IN THOSE FACILITIES. SO WHEN WE ARE ABSENT WITHOUT POWER THAT THESE PEOPLE COULD BE TAKING CARE OF AS THEY ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. RIGHT CENTER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT- SO I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS RELATING TO THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS IN THESE FACILITIES ARE CARED FOR IN AN APPROPRIATELY MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO PROVIDE THE SAME FLEXIBILITY- AS THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS DO AND I JUST WONDER IF YOU COULD COMMENT. ON THE INHERENT DANGER THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH STORING THAT MUCH FUEL ON SITE FOR NINETY SIX HOURS OF POWER SHOULD THEY NEED TO DO THAT THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S A LOT OF FUEL SO. IF YOU WANT TO DRESS CITING YOUR CLOTHES OR NOW WHATEVER IS FINE- MISTER PRESIDENT BUT THAT'S A CONCERN THAT I HAVE- AND I WOULD. LOVE SOME CLARITY ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR GLAZER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF HAPPY TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION SENATOR DODD AND I HAVE- SO HAVING BACKUP GENERATORS IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE SOLUTION NOW. A CENTER DOT AND I HAVE A BILL THAT DEALS WITH OTHER CRITICAL FACILITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES HOSPITAL'S WATER PLANTS. THAT HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS BUT BECAUSE OF- AIR REGULATIONS. PUT RISK POTENTIALLY PUT RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY RUN THE- ANSWER BY- GUIDANCE TO THE AUTHOR- IS TO AS IS. TO THE ASSEMBLY IS THAT CONSIDERED AN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT TO HER BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT HAVING THE GENERATOR IS ONE THING BUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU BILL RUN. AND THAT THERE IS A HUGE. AND BURDEN PLACED ON THESE THIS BOB REGARDING YOUR QUALITY DON'T DOESN'T GET IN THE WAY OF THE GOOD GOALS THE CHEESE OUTLINED IN THE BILL AND WHY I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. FAMOUS PRESIDENT I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE AND BEEN THROUGH TOO MANY OF THESE INCIDENTS- HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER LIVING IN ONE OF THESE SNIFFS AND IT'S AN EXPERIENCE TO GO THROUGH EVEN IF THEY'RE AT A WELL FACILITY LET ALONE. FACILITY THAT DOESN'T LOOK AFTER THEIR THERE'S- I WOULD I WOULD RAISE I WOULD CLARIFY THE BILL DOESN'T SPECIFY- THE EXACT SOURCE OF WHERE THE BACKUP POWER COMES FROM IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DEFAULT- TO DIESEL GENERATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT KIND OF- HERE DISTRICT OVERSIGHT OR THE- BACKUP FUEL CAPACITY I THINK THAT WAS MEANT. IN SOME OPPOSITE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THREE PEOPLE ON SITE OF WE HAVE AN EXTREMELY- ENCOURAGING INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE FOR THESE KINDS OF FACILITIES TO INSTALL A FUEL CELL BATTERY STORAGE SYSTEM ON SITE. COMBINE THAT WITH THE TURBINE. LOOK AT THEIR RIGHT WIENER SOLUTIONS I THEY CAN ALSO MEET THIS TEST THAT MADE MAY BE ABLE TO OFFSET ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WITH YEAR DISTRICTS AND COULD FIND A MORE EXPEDITIOUS PAT FORDE SO LOOK FOR TO STAYING GAUGE ON THE ISSUE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL. GREATER DISCUSSION ON THE SIDE ON SCENE NO ADDITIONAL MIKE'S THROUGH JACKSON TALK TO CLOSETHANK YOU SO MUCH YES AND I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION THIS IS A BILL STILL IN PROGRESS THIS IS A- VERY. SORT OF. ONE A LOGICAL BUILD WANT TO PROTECT OUR SENIORS ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN THESE OF THE SENIOR NURSING FACILITIES- TO RESPOND TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE. I BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE AND INCENTIVES HOPEFULLY TO BE AVAILABLE- AS FAR AS THE KIND OF BACK UP GENERATION I KNOW THAT THE SOLAR INDUSTRY SUPPORTS THIS BILL I BELIEVE THEY THINK THAT THEY CAN. BE OF ASSISTANCE REDUCING POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY FUELS ON A FACILITY- TO GENERATE THE NINETY SIX HOURS WORTH OF ELECTRICITY- I AM NOT AWARE THAT THIS BILL WILL AFFECT A QUOTE UNQUOTE FLEXIBILITY MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT ON THE- LEVEL. IS AT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S BOARD INDICATES CONCERN THAT OF THE FEDERALLY LICENSED FACILITIES ARE NOT EVEN MEET. US FEDERAL STANDARDS ARE THEY ARE IN PLACE- SO AT AND I AM MORE THAN TO KEEP ME WORKING ON HOW WE GOING TO MAKE. UP FOR THESE FOR BUT WE KNOW WE AND. THE THERE WERE A LOT OF. AND WILL CAN TO BE ON THE BEST WAY TO DO THE BUT BASS THE SIMPLY A- THE NINETY SIX HOUR REQUIREMENT TO ALL OF OUR STATE FACILITIES WITH THE HOPES THAT WE WILL. MAKE SURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND ARE SAFE DURING THESE CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES- THAT HAVE BEEN AGAIN MADE EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BY OUR TO SITUATE SO WITH THAT ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIFLE.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS MEMBERS LAST YEAR MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOREIGN FARMWORKERS WERE IMPORTED BY ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA GROWERS IN FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS UNDER THE H. TWO A FEDERAL V. SO PROGRAM. THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN INCREASING ANNUALLY FOR THOSE OF YOU UNFAMILIAR WITH THE H. TO A PROGRAM IT HAS MANY OF THE SAME PROVISIONS AND PROBLEMS THAT THE INFAMOUS FOR SERRA PROGRAM HAD WHICH WAS TERMINATED BECAUSE OF SYSTEMIC LABOR HOUSING IN WAGE ABUSES. THE H. TO A FARM WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LARGELY RECRUITED IN MEXICO ARE TIED TO A SINGLE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYER WHO MUST PROVIDE THEM WITH HOUSING. MEALS AND TRANSPORTATION TO WORK SITES. MANY AGE TO A WORKERS HAVE NEVER BEEN TO CALIFORNIA BEFORE AND ARE BELIEVED TO NEITHER SPEAK NOR READ ENGLISH. IF THEY ARE FIRED FOR ANY REASON THEY'RE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION WHICH IS A POWERFUL DISINCENTIVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANY ABUSE OF WORKPLACE CONDITIONS. THEY MAY BE SUBJECTED TO. SENATE BILL ELEVEN OH TWO REQUIRES H. TO EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE EACH TO A FARMWORKERS ON THEIR FIRST DAY AT WORK WITH A SHORT COMPREHENSIVE WRITTEN SUMMARY OF KEY LABOR HOUSING HEALTH AND SAFETY. REGULATIONS IN PROTECTIONS IN OTHER CALIFORNIA LAWS IN SPANISH AND IF REQUESTED IN ENGLISH. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THIS BILL MEMBERS IS DURING THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS. WE'VE SEEN ONE OF THE HIGHEST SPIKES. IN COVERT NINETEEN INFECTIONS AMONG IMMIGRANT FARM WORKERS. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES NOTICE TO INCLUDE THE DECLARATION OF ANY EMERGENCY THAT COULD TO SURROUND. THE WORKPLACE WHERE THE WORKER IS BEING. TAKEN TO FOR WORK- THE COVERT NINETEEN VIRUS IS INDEED INTERNATIONAL PART OF A PANDEMIC. BUT FOR WORKERS IN AGRICULTURE THE RISKS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS EVEN GREATER BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PROXIMITY AND HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND WORKPLACE. SENATE BILL ELEVEN- TO CREATE A SAFER LEGALLY COMPLIANT WORKPLACE FOR H. TO A FARMWORKERS AND REDUCES ANY INCENTIVES THAT UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS MIGHT HAVE TO HIRE WORKERS WHOM THEY CAN UNDER PAYING MISTREAT BECAUSE THE WORKERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS OR HOW TO HAVE THEM IN FORCED.

THE SPEAKING TO THE BILL A REPORT ON YOUR PERSONAL POINT OF PRIVILEGE JUST WANNA ANNOUNCED MY NEWEST GRANDCHILD I APOLOGIZE- ALL. RIGHT GRANT. GET THE MOTHER IS A WRECK A FORMER RESIDENT OF GUARDINO MISTER PRESIDENT AT ONE OF YOUR CONSTITUENCY IS. AND SO COLLEAGUES JUST WANTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT- BOOK IN. CODE ZERO YOUR HIGHNESS MORE LIKE WAS BORN ON THE SEVENTEENTH AT EIGHT FORTY ONE AM IS NINE AND NINE POUNDS ONE OUNCE TWENTY ONE INCHES PUTS A LOT LIKE HIS FATHER WHEN HE WAS A NEWBORN. AND THE U. ELEVEN MONICA. IT IS THEIR SECOND IT IS OUR FIFTH AND WE'RE EXPECTING NUMBER SIX IN DECEMBER WITH MY DAUGHTER SO TO. PRODUCTIVE YEARS OLD THIS ONE TO ANNOUNCE THAT THANK YOU. NO TO THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT IT WAS THIS IT WAS A CASUAL CONVERSATION ONE A DAY WITH THE MAYOR OF. OF MY CITY HE HAD RECENTLY REMODELED HIS ENTIRE HOME IT'S A GORGEOUS- MISSION STYLE FORMAT. ANY MENTION YOU KNOW WHEN I REMODELED I WENT AHEAD AND PUT IN A GENERATOR. AND I HAVE A- POWERED BY NATURAL GAS AND EDISON HAD A POWER OUTAGE RECENTLY AND- IT WAS OUT FOR A GOOD EIGHT HOURS BUT HIS HOME WAS THE ONLY ONE LIT UP ON THE STREET FOR THAT ENTIRE PERIOD OF TIME AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME ALL MY GOODNESS NATURAL GAS. OF COURSE WHY ARE WE USING THAT WOULD WE HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS SO WHERE NATURAL GAS IS AVAILABLE AND PROPANE IS AVAILABLE IT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED FOR BACKUP GENERATORS. THE THOUGHT OF TRANSPORTING DIESEL WHICH WAS ALREADY MENTIONED EARLIER ESPECIALLY DURING A FIRE CONFLAGRATION IS FRIGHTENING LET ALONE THE STORAGE OF AN ON SITE BUT CLEANER FUELS LIKE NATURAL GAS AND PROPANE SHOULD STRONGLY BE. WHEN EMERGENCY INSIST TO A BACKUP GENERATOR IT FOR. LIKE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE RECENT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THE ARE NOW CALLED PS PS. AND EXCEED THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL A LOT OF TIME FOR THE YEAR. CLEAN BURNING GENERATORS EXEMPTED TO SB ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE UPDATES THE FOR THESE NATURAL GAS PROPANE GENERATORS. IS NOT DURING THE EXISTING DIESEL GENERATORS BE REPLACED. AND LANGUAGE WILL BE A- INSERTED. TO CLARIFY THIS INCORRECT ASSUMPTION- WHEN WE TAKE IT OVER HOPEFULLY TO THE ASSEMBLY BUT LET'S CLARIFY THE CODE FOR THE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GENERATING ENERGY WHEN NEEDED AND DO IT WITH FUELS THAT ARE BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ON SB SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER STERN THANK YOU MISS PRESENT QUESTION THE AUTHOR. LOT THAT THE QUESTION PLEASE THANK YOU A AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AT AT I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN. NOT JUST IN A PERSONA CAPACITY BUT PROFESSIONALLY ALSO WORKING ON THIS- HERITAGE ISSUE IN FIRE ZONES FOR A WHILE. WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION IS CONCERNED THAT- NATURAL GAS IS REALLY THE ONLY TECHNOLOGY REALLY CALLED OUT AS A CLEAN IN FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE. AND I'M WONDERING- THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL SEEMS TO ALSO ACCOMMODATE EITHER- CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES SOLAR STORAGE OF FUEL CELLS- ISTHERE AN INTENT- WITH WITH THIS BILL TO ALSO. PUSH FOR THOSE OTHER CLEAN ALTERNATE IS AS OPPOSED TO JUST A NATURAL GAS ALTERNATIVE TO DIESEL WE WERE WE'RE HOPING THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION FOR THE- PRESIDENT- WE WERE HOPING TO ALSO ADD PROPANE- WIN WOMEN THE BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY. BUT I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS AS WELL. IT THANK YOU AT YET IT'S HARD TO. STAND UP AND PUSH FOR JUST TO FOSSIL FUEL VERSUS FOSSIL FUEL APPROACH I THINK I CAN SUPPORT THE MEASURE THOUGH IF I DO HAVE SOME CLARITY THAT RENEWABLE SOURCES OF POWER ARE SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT AS IT CURRENTLY COST EFFECTIVE FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO BOTH GAS AND DIESEL SO. IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO JUST NOT PUT TOO HEAVY OF A THUMB ON THESCALE I THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS. THANK YOU. SOONER ARTILLERY YES QUESTION FOR THE OFFICE. BUT AS ONE OF THE CLARIFIED. SEPT PLEASE AS WANT TO CLARIFY THAT USING ALSO THE ALL SYSTEMS ALL OPPORTUNITIES THERE EVERY EVERY YEAR BIT OF ENERGY THAT YOU COULD FIND OTHER THAN JUST NAME MEANS GAS AND WE HEARD ABOUT DIESEL WE HEARD. ABOUT OTHERS AND THERE'S A HYDROGEN IN THE FUTURE BATTERIES IN THE FUTURE YEARS TO COME WHO KNOWS. I MEAN YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT THAT'S MY QUESTION. I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO THAT I WHERE WE REALIZE IS THAT WE HAD- AN ENERGY SOURCE. THAT WAS NOT ALLOWED FOR IN THE CODE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS. TAKEN CARE OF BUT I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS- THE PROBLEMI HAD WHEN I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR OF THE CODE WAS SILENT YOU COULDN'T DO IT SO- OUR REACTION WAS ALL MY GOODNESS LET'S LET'S PROVIDE FOR- THIS ABILITY- ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE READY OF BUSINESS FOR A HOSPITAL THAT HAS ACCESS TO. THE NATURAL GAS KNACK FOR YOU KNOW ON. A IS A FORMER BUSINESS SO WHY NOT HAVE A GENERATOR THAT'S POWER. THAT WAY AND PROVIDE FOR EMERGENCY VARIANCES. SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO ACCOMMODATE SOMETHING THAT MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE AND pIS A WHOLE LOT. CLEANER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN DIESEL. THANK YOU FOR PRESIDENT.

PET OWNERS CAN GIVE THEIR ANIMALS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATIONS BUT STATE LAW CURRENTLY PROHIBITS NON VETERINARY MEDICAL SHELTER STAFF FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THE SAME THIS MEANS THAT IF AN ANIMAL COMES INTO A SHELTER THE STAFF CAN EUTHANIZING ANIMALS CANNOT TREAT FOR FLEAS.

THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS REQUIRED TO REPRESENT THE CLAIMANT IN THE DID NOVO PROCEEDINGS HOWEVER WHEN A WAGE CLAIM IS FORCED TO ARBITRATE WHICH CLAIM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S UNABLE TO PROVIDE NO COST REPRESENTATION. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD UPDATE EXISTING LAW AND ALLOW CLAIMANTS AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS TO RECEIVE NO COST REPRESENTATION FROM THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE INCREASED USE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS BY AUTHORIZING THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO REPRESENT WAGE CLAIMANTS AN ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE WAGE CLAIM DURING THE DURING.

SENATE BILL NINE SEVENTY TWO BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION. SENATOR SKINNER. OKAY THERE YOU GO. THEY WILL START AGAIN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDING OFFICER MEMBERS SO WE POLICYMAKERS AND OF COURSE THE PUBLIC WOULD BE MUCH BETTER POSITIONED TO DISCUSS EVALUATE AND MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT. HE TERRY POLICY IF WE HAD ACCESS TO SPECIFIC DATA ON THE MANY TAX CREDITS WE PROVIDE. WHO TAKES THEM WHAT BENEFITS ARE THEY PROVIDING CAN IN RECENT YEARS AS WE HAVE ADOPTED TAX CREDITS LIKE THE FILM TAX CREDIT WE HAVE REQUIRED THAT THOSE ENTITIES THAT TAKE US TAKE IT INFORM US THAT THEY ARE TAKING THAT TAX CREDIT. AND GIVE US THE INFORMATION AS TO THE- JOBS THEY CREATED FILMS THEY PRODUCED IT CETERA IN CALIFORNIA. NOW SB NINE SEVENTY TWO DOES NOT GO THAT FAR WHY WOULD. WHAT THE BILL TO BASICALLY GIVE US INFORMATION ON EVERY SINGLE TAX CREDIT. BUT BECAUSE OF THE COST FOR STAFF TO- AT THE F. T. V. TO PUT UP ANAPPROPRIATE. DATA LIKE THAT BY SKILLED THE BACK. BUT THIS IS STILL A VERY VALUABLE MEASURE AND WHAT IT DOES IS. REQUIRES LARGE CORPORATIONS THOSE WITH FIVE BILLION PLUS IN GROCERY STREETS. TO DISCLOSE ANNUALLY YES THREE DATA POINTS NUMBER ONE THEIR NAME NUMBER TWO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STATE TAX VOTER PAID IN THAT YEAR. AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STATE TAX CREDITS TAKEN NOW THIS IS FAR LESS INFORMATION THAN WE CAN ACCESS FEDERALLY AS A RESULT OF THE DODD FRANK BILL THE DODD FRANK BILL. REQUIRES ALL PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS IN THE US TO FILE WITH THE SEC ANNUALLY AND GIVE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION INCLUDING THE FEDERAL STATE TAX PAID. THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS THE AMOUNT OF THE CEOS PAY THE GAP OR OR- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEDIAN EMPLOYEE PAYING CEO PAY. THIS BILL JUST GIVES US THE SIMPLE INFORMATION I MENTIONED FOR THE STATE BECAUSE OTHERWISE CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT KNOW. NOW LET ME BE CLEAR SB NINE SEVEN TWO DOES NOT RAISE TAXES NOT AT ALL NOR DOES IT ELIMINATE ANY TAX CREDIT OR EXPENDITURE IT JUST GIVES US ACCESS TO INFORMATION. THE F. T. B.'S ESTIMATE IS THAT IT WOULD AFFECT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED CORPORATIONS THAT DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THESE ARE NOT JUST CORPORATIONS HEADQUARTERED BUT ANY THAT DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA WITH FIVE BILLION OR ABOVE GROSS RECEIPTS. NOW THE OPPOSITION CALLS THIS BILL SHAMING BILL THAT IS NOT MY PURPOSE. I CARRIED A BILL SIMILAR TO THIS BACK IN THE ORIGINAL RECESSION WHEN WE WERE DEBATING WHETHER WE SHOULD ELIMINATE CERTAIN TAX EXPENDITURES WHETHER WE SHOULD PUT IN NEW ONES. AND I AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE FELT THAT WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE INFORMATION THAT WHEN WE PASS TAX CREDITS WE PASSED THEM FOR GOOD PURPOSES. BUT MORE INFO WOULD HELP US EVALUATE THEM NOW THIS DOES NOT GO AS I MENTIONED AS FAR AS I WOULD LIKE BUT HE BEGINS TO GIVE US SOME BASIC INFORMATION. AND IT ALSO WOULD ALIGN US WITH SOME FIFTEEN OTHER STATES SUCH AS FLORIDA INDIANA MINNESOTA MISSISSIPPI NEBRASKA AND OKLAHOMA ALL OF WHICH REQUIRE CORPORATIONS WITHIN. THAT STATE TO DISCLOSE SIMILAR INFORMATION. SO BY WITH THAT THE FINAL THING IS THIS INFORMATION WOULD GO ON THE F. T. B.'S WEBSITE AND AS I MENTIONED IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE TAX CREDITS AND IT DOES NOT RAISE TAXES AND WITH THAT. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. ANY DESCRIPTION OR THE BAIT. SENATOR DORADO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I BELIEVE THAT IF WE'RE GONNA LEAD ON THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY ESPECIALLY NOW THE CALIFORNIA MUST MAKE SURE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS BENEFIT CALIFORNIA WORKERS. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD PROVIDE NEW JOBS CREATE NEW JOBS THEY SHOULD PROVIDE FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES BENEFITS TRAINING AND HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS. TAX INCENTIVES SHOULD REQUIRE COMPANIES TO COMMIT. TO WORKER PROTECTIONS ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS AND TRAINING WITH ESPECIALLY FROM COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THOSE KINDS OF JOBS. COMPANIES I THINK SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMITMENTS THEY MAKE WHEN THEY BENEFIT FROM OUR TAX DOLLARS. TRANSPARENCY FOR OUR TAX DOLLARS PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY IS AN OBJECTIVE WAY FOR ENFORCING THESE COMMITMENTS HOWEVER PUBLIC OVERSIGHT ON TAXPAYER DOLLARS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN STYMIED. I SUPPORT SB NINE SEVENTY TWO BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO ENSURE RESPONSIBILITY WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE BAY SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MAY POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR PLEASE CARTER TO QUESTION YES. THANK YOU. AND I WANNA MAKE CERTAIN NINE I UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS REPORT WILL BE MADE PUBLIC AND POSTED ON THE WEBSITE F. T. BCS. IF IT'S THE IDEA OF AUDITINGTO MAKE CERTAIN THAT FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT THAT. ANY INCENTIVES THAT THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES ANY CREDITS THAT ARE RECEIVED BY THESE CORPORATIONS- WITH THIS NOT BE. EASILY AFFECTED THROUGH THE AUDIT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL THE ASSEMBLY OR THE SENATE- INCORPORATED INTO. THE NATURAL PROCESS OF THE LEGISLATURE. PERMISSION TO FOR FUTURE USE. IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE STATE AUDITOR AND TO- OR ABILITY TO THROUGH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVED THE STATE AUDITOR TO DO AUDITS- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE STATE AUDITOR ONLY HAS SO MUCH CAPACITY AND I COULD BUT I WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE OR EVEN THE LEGISLATURE WHATEVER ASKED THE STATE AUDITOR TO AUDIT. ALL SET FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES I THINK WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS AND- DI DID NOT MENTION THAT IT DOES NOT REVEAL ANY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. IS JUST TO GIVE US THREE DATA POINTS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY. THE MAITRE MOUNTAINS STATE TAX PAID IN TOTAL IN TOTAL THE NAME OUT OF STATE TAX CREDITS PAID WE ALREADY HAVE THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE SAME COMPANIES IN TERMS OF WHAT. FEDERAL TAXES THEY PAY AND WHAT FEDERAL STATE OF FEDERAL CREDIT STATE TAKE BUT WE DO NOT HAVE IT. FOR THE STATE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. NORMALLY WHEN I HEAR ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT IF CORPORATIONS- RECEIVED PUBLIC BENEFITS OR PUBLIC INVESTMENTS. I THINK IT'S REASONABLE. TO ASK THAT THAT BE DISCLOSED MY CONCERN IS THAT POSTING IT ON THE WEBSITE IN NOT SIMPLY BRING IT BACK TO- THE POLICY MAKERS FOR FOLKS WITHIN- THE GOVERNMENT FIELD. MIGHT VIOLATE EXPECTATIONS OF PRIVACY. AND THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A BALANCE HERE ON WHETHER OR NOT IT NEEDS TO BE MADE PUBLIC AS OPPOSED TO IT BEING INFORMATION THAT OTHERS CAN ACCESS. DID YOU AS YOU WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO THAT WITH THAT EVER CONSIDERED AS AN OPTION- WAS CERTAINLY. THERE'S ALWAYS THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT LEVEL OF STAFF TIME IS REQUIRED AND GIVEN THAT WE ARE IN DEFICIT. MODE IN MAY BE ASKING OUR STATE EMPLOYEES TO FOR LOW AND SUCH. WE WERE TRYING TO DESIGN A BILL THAT WOULD PUT THE LEAST PHONE- AMOUNT OF STAFF. TIME REQUIREMENT AND SO BY THE EASE OF PUTTING IT UP ONCE ONE ANNUALLY. THEN WE ALL HAVE THE ACCESS THE INFORMATION ANYTIME WE WANTED VERSUS HAVING TO REQUESTED FROM STAFF AND HAVING STAFF HAVE TO PRODUCE THAT INFORMATION EACH TIME IT EACH INDIVIDUAL REQUEST. THIS IS MORE EFFICIENT. A SINNER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT- JUST A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. THERE MAY WITH THE AUTHOR EXCERPTED QUESTION YES. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ENACTED THE TAXPAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS AND IT- ALSO RE ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. DO WE NEED TO MODIFY THE TAX PAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS OR- ARE WE SORT OF. OPENING A DOOR FOR MORE MORE CHANGES IN THERE FOR MAYBE. GOING BACK ON A COMMITMENT THAT THIS LEGISLATURE MAY. WITH PERMISSION TO THE TEACHER HE- THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE. ANY TAX FILING TO BE DISCLOSED SO THE FIVE HUNDRED APPROXIMATELY AT A STRIP BY FTV COMPANIES THAT ARE IMPACTED DO NOT HAVE TO. GIVE PUBLICLY OR DISCLOSE THEIR ACTUAL TAX FILING SOLELY AND ONLY THE THREE DATA POINTS THAT I GAVE SO IN THAT RESPECT IT IS NOT AN INTERFERENCE WITH THE TAXPAYER BILL OF RIGHTS STATUTES.

MORE LIKE NOW. VICE TWENTY NINE KNOWS ELEVEN THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM NINETY THREE SENATOR JACKSON MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL NINE FIFTY SIX BY SENATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION SENATE JACKSON FOR GEORGE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES TO SERVE BILL MAY SOUND FAMILIAR IN THAT IT WAS SIMILAR TO ONE THAT I BROUGHT LAST YEAR. IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF TAX EXPENDITURES WHICH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE- FROM BERKELEY HAS SO- JUST- PRESENTED ON THE FLOOR. IF I GIVE YOU A DOLLAR ON THE PROMISE THAT YOU WILL GIVE ME BACK FIVE. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD DEAL. BUT IF I GIVE YOU A DOLLAR ON THE PROMISE YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME BACK FIVE BUT YOU ONLY GIVE ME BACK TWENTY FIVE CENTS THAT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL. AND SO FOR YEARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HAD THE SO CALLED TAX EXPENDITURES. WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN TAX CREDITS TAX BREAKS TAX INCENTIVES. WHICH HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR VARIOUS DIFFERENT PURPOSES. SOME OF THEM TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES SOME OF THEM TO ENCOURAGE BETTER TREATMENT IN THE WORK FORCE FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT MANY OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES ARE FIFTY SIXTY YEARS OLD. AND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ANALYZED SO THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO SOME OF OUR STAGE MOST COSTLY TAX INCENTIVES BY CREATING THAT PROCESS FOR THEIR ANALYSIS AND PUBLIC REVIEW. THIS MEASURE ALLOWS THE% LEGISLATURE THROUGH RIGOROUS ANALYSIS THE INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS AND THE RECOMMENDATION OF AN INDEPENDENT FIVE MEMBER BOARD TO DETERMINE IF HESE TAX EXPENDITURES. ARE COST EFFECTIVE IMPROPERLY DESIGNED WHETHER THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY MEETING THEIR INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES AND ARE WORTHY OF BEING CONTINUED. THIS IS BY SECTOR BY INDUSTRY WE'RE NOT CALLING OUT ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOME OF THESE TAX INCENTIVES REALLY MAKES SENSE TODAY. AND IF THEY DO MAKE SENSE FOR EXAMPLE THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY TAX CREDIT BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ONE OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUES SHE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES TRUST SUCH A PROCESS THAT I'VE IDENTIFIED HERE. FOR ALL NEW TAX INCENTIVES THAT WERE CREATED FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN ON ONE OF THEM WAS THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY TAX CREDIT. REQUIRED THE INDUSTRY TO COME FORWARD OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INCENTIVES WE HAD GIVEN THEM WERE IN FACT RETURNING FIVE DOLLARS OR FOUR DOLLARS PER DOLLAR WE GAVE THEM IN TAX CREDITS WHAT WE DISCOVERED WHAT IN FACT. IT WAS WORKING SO WELL THAT WE ACTUALLY INCREASED THE INCENTIVE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA THOUGH ABOUT THESE TAX INCENTIVES THAT WERE CREATED BEFORE. TWENTY FOURTEEN. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS MEASURE WILL DO IT WILL. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME EIGHTY TAX BREAKS OR ACTUALLY IT'S ONLY GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT ABOUT NINE OF THEM BUT WE HAVE EIGHTY OF THEM THAT EVERY YEAR COSTS THIS STATE UP TO SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS. NOW IF YOU TAKE 40% OF THAT LET'S SAY THEY AREN'T WORKING. YOU TAKE BILLION DOLLARS THERE WOULD GO TO EDUCATION. LET'S SAY MOST OF THEM ARE WORKING IN OUR PROVIDING US WITH THE EXPECTATIONS WE HAD WHEN WE INTRODUCE THEM. AT LEAST WE WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE RECEIVING THAT BENEFIT BUT IF WE ARE NOT. THIS MEASURE CALLS FOR AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BY THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. IT THEN CALLS FOR AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW BOARD. WHICH WILL ANALYZE THE INFORMATION AND PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE INFORMATION POLICIES OF THE STATE WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THOSE CREDITS. THIS IS JUST GOOD GOVERNANCE AND IN FACT THE LA- SEVERAL YEARS AGO TWENTY FIFTEEN SHOULD WE DON'T DO THOSE FOLKS AND WE REALLY SHORT. IN FACT THERE ARE MANY OTHER STATES THAT HAVE DONE THIS STATES LIKE TEXAS LOUISIANA NORTH DAKOTA MISSISSIPPI AND INDIANA. FOR EXAMPLE DO THESE EXACT KINDS OF ANALYSES AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GETTING THE BANG FOR THEIR BUCK THAT THEY EXPECT AND BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF THEIR STATE SHOULD HAVE THAT'S WHAT THIS MEASURE DOES. AND WITH THAT ARE AGAIN LOOKING AT OUR BUDGET DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE IF THERE IS MONEY THAT CAN AND SHOULD COME BACK TO THE STATE WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT IF WE SHOULD BE INVESTING EVEN MORE WE KNOW ABOUT IT THE FACT IS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO. WITH IT BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE. YOU DISCUSS AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SCHIRMER. RESHAPE BEEN ABLE BE HERE ARMED. ARE YOU KNOW A WITH IN LIGHT OF THE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT- I'M COMMITTED TO LIMITED CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT NOT EXPANDING GOVERNMENT WHICH WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE HAVE OVER SIX HUNDRED GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT AND NOW WE WANT TO CREATE AOTHER BUREAUCRACY- WHICH IS JUST GONNA COST MORE MONEY TO TAXPAYERS AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR THIS BILL SUPPORTED OUR COURSE UNIONS WHO ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR AS- THERE B. L. AN INCREASE. FUNDING FOR. HIGHER RETIREMENTS AND HIGHER WAGES AND THAT TYPE OF THING SO I'M OPPOSED TO IT AGAIN BECAUSE I'M NOT IN FAVOR. OF OCT EXPANDING. THE ALREADY. OVER BUREAUCRATIC STATE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU IN ADDITION DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF. HEARING SEEN NINE SENATOR JACKSON WILL TALK TO CLOSE. KATE THAT THE- THANK YOU THAT THE OUR BOARD SUNSET SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT IT'S PRESENTED ITS REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT IF I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN AND LEARN THAT THAT ONE DOLLAR I'M GIVING YOU IS ONLY RETURNING TWENTY FIVE CENTS THAT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE AND I'M GONNA STOP BUT IF IT'S GIVEN ME BACK FIVE BUCKS FOR EVERY DOLLAR PUT IN THAT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT AND THAT IS WHAT WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT AND RELY UPON US TO PRODUCE. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN I ARCHULETA. OR AYE ATKINS. FIVE EIGHT NO BELL I FOR JUST. NO BRADFORD I HAVE A.

BROWN'S SECTOR PLEASE RATE. SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT BY SENATOR WINNER AND ACTUALLY DID A HOUSING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT CALLED THE SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT- WILL ENSURE THAT CITIES ARE ZONING FOR- AND ALLOWING SHELTER FOR HOMELESS RESIDENTS BY ELEVEN SIR SB ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT ALSO INSURANCE TIMELY ADOPTION OF A HOUSING ELEMENT- WERE- WHICH RIGHT NOW THERE IS A LOOPHOLE THAT IS ALLOWING CITIES TO GO YEARS AND YEARS. WITHOUT ADOPTING A HOUSING ELEMENT OUR COLLEAGUES NEARLY POPULATION- IS ON OUR STREETS. HI WHEN YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION WE ARE LESS THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF THE NATION'S POPULATION BUT ONE HALF OF ALL ON SHELTER HOMELESS PEOPLE. ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT JUST RANDOM AND IT'S OUTRAGEOUS AND IT'S A MORAL FAILURE BY OUR STATE. EVERY CALIFORNIA AND WITH OR WITHOUT OUSING DESERVES TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. AND THIS IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. UNDER EXISTING HOUSING ELEMENT LAW CITIES ARE REQUIRED TO DESIGNATE A ZONE AND THERE CITY WERE HOMELESS SHELTERS CAN BE PERMITTED AS OF RIGHT. THIS IS ADOPTED YEARS AGO IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS A PART OF A CITY WHERE YOU CAN CITE A HOMELESS SHELTER WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH A CONDITIONAL USE PROCESS WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE ALL SORTS OF FIGHTS AND LITIGATION. HOWEVER SOME CITIES ARE DESIGNATING A ZONE. IN AN AREA AREAS WERE KNOWN WHATEVER BUILD A HOMELESS SHELTER ON THE FAR OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY FAR AWAY FROM ANY TRANSPORTATION OR SERVICES. IN AN INDUSTRIAL AREA IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE. WERE YOU KNOW WHATEVER SAID A HOMELESS SHELTER OR IN AN AREA WHERE IT IS PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY SO YOU ONE BECAUSE IT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. BUILT OUT. SB ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT WILL REQUIRE- DIED IN HIS OWN THAT'S DESIGNATED CITIES WILL STILL HAVE ENORMOUS FLEXIBILITY WHERE IT'S A DESIGNATED. BUT IT WILL REQUIRE THAT IT NOT BE IN A REMOTE INDUSTRIAL AREA THAT'D BE- GEOGRAPHICALLY CONNECTED TO EITHER TRANSIT OR SERVICES. SOMEWHERE WHERE PEOPLEWOULD ACTUALLY BUILD A SHELTER IN ADDITION A CANNOT BE IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. TO ACTUALLY SITES SHELTER IN ADDITION A STILL IN THIRTY IT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE THAT SOME CITIES ARE USING. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT THAT NEVER ACTUALLY GETS APPROVED. CREATING BETTER INCENTIVES FOR CITIES TO ACTUALLY COMPLETE THE HOUSING IMPROPER. AND TO APPROVE IT OUR RISK. OUT AND I'VE- THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DEBATE OR DISCUSS CENTER MY- THANK YOU I'M LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THE REASON THAT WE HAVE SUCH AN ENORMOUS HOMELESS POPULATION IN THIS STATE IS BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF THIS BUILDING. IT'S NOT BECAUSE SOMETHING THE LOCALS DID IT IS BECAUSE OF THE LAWS AND THE POLICIES THAT ARE PUT OUT BY THE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING SPECIFICALLY THE MAJORITY PARTY HAS BEEN RUNNING THIS STATE INTO THE GROUND FOR THE LAST MANY YEARS SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR OR JUST. TO PUSH THE PROBLEM DOWN ON TO THE TO SAY PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE CREATED THAT DOESN'T SEEM EQUITABLE TO ME. SO I THINK IT RATHER THAN SOLUTION IS TO NOT BREATHE DOWN THE NEXT OF THE LOCALS AND TELL THEM WHERE HOMELESS SHELTERS SHOULD BE BUT ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THAT DECISION FOR THEMSELVES UNLESS OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO PUT POLICIES OUT. FROM THIS BUILDING. THAT DO SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND HOMELESS PROBLEM RATHER THAN EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE- TIME AFTER TIME YEAR AFTER YEAR WE PASS BILLS. THAT MAKE THE COST OF LIVING MORE EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE INCREASED THE COST OF LITERALLY EVERYTHING IN THE STATE TO THE POINT. WHERE WE'VE HAD FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LEAVE THE STATE LAST DECADE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND THOSE WHO CAN'T MOVE HAD MOVED TO THE STREETS. THAT'S THE FAULT OF THE POLICIES COMING OUT OF THIS BUILDING NOT THE FAULT OF THE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS I WOULD URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR BORCHERS. QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR PLEASE MISS PRESENT CENTER WHEN WE TAKE A QUESTION AS TO A FUTURE FOR THE CHAIR THEN THANK YOU. PRIOR TO MY EXPERIENCE IN SACRAMENTO I SERVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND MY RECOLLECTION IS YOU DID TO. ON BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- HAVING SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. ALL USE FRESNO IS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE- MOST HOTLY DEBATED ISSUES IS WHERE TO PUT A SHELTER. AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THERE MORE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIND AN ACCEPTABLE LOCATION BUT IT'S INEVITABLY TURNING INTO A DOG FIGHT MY CONCERN IS THAT FORCING THIS. THAT THE HOUSING PLAN- BE STATUTORILY ARE THE TIME PERIOD WITHIN WHICH THE STATUTORILY DECREASED IF THEY DON'T IS OF CONCERN TO ME. AS THIS IS GOING THROUGH THE VARIOUS COMMITTEE PROCESS USED WAS THAT EVER SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED REMOVING. AS A AS A AS A PROVISION SO. AT THE PRESENT PLEASE. WHICH IS TO BE CLEARER- TO THE- US TO CENTER FROM UP FRESNO COUNTY- V. THERE ARE WO PARTS OF THE BILL AND THE TWO PARTS ARE NOT AND THEY'RE NOT ALL BOTH ABOUT HOMELESS SHELTERS. THERE'S A ONE PART THE TAKE EXISTING LAW FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS CITIES ARE REQUIRED WHEN THEY DO THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT TO DESIGNATE A BY RIGHT ZONE FOR HOMELESS SHELTERS AND THIS SIMPLY PUTS MORE PARAMETERS AROUND THAT. FOR THE CITIES ARE PUTTING IT OUT YOU KNOW TWENTY MILES AWAY FROM ANY SERVICES OR TRANSIT OR ANYTHING ELSE WERE NO WHATEVER BILL THE SHELTER THAT'S THE ONE PIECE WERE SIMPLY PUTTING GUARDRAILS AROUND AN EXISTING REQUIREMENTS. THE SECOND PIECE IS NOT A SPECIFIC TO HOMELESS SHELTERS IT'S ABOUT SIMPLY ADOPTING A HOUSING ELEMENT TO BEGIN WITH EVERY CITY AND COUNTY HAS TO ADOPT. A HOUSING ELEMENT THAT'S LONG FIFTY YEAR STATE LAW. ON BUT WE DON'T HAVE STRONG GUARDRAILS NOW ABOUT ACTUALLY ADOPTING A IN A TIMELY WAY AND SO CITIES WILL HAVE A DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT THAT'S NEVER BEEN ACTUALLY APPROVED. AND I WILL GO ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND SO THE BILL PUTS IN STRONGER INCENTIVES. TO SAID THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR ADOPTED HOUSING ELEMENT WITHIN FOUR MONTHS OF THE DEADLINE SO NOT EVEN BY THE DEADLINE. WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS AFTER THE DEADLINE YOU NEED TO HAVE A DOCTOR TO AND IF YOU DON'T DOZEN THERE'S A SHORTER TIME FRAME FOR DOING THE RECALL REZONING UNDER THE POLICY ON THAT. SO ONE IS ABOUT HOMELESS SHELTERS ONE IS ABOUT HOUSING ELEMENTS IN GENERAL. I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION CORRECTLY. I THINK THE- THE IDEA OF A HALF OF APPROVING A HOUSING ELEMENT. IS ONE WAS CONTROVERSIAL. ASPECTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK HAVING. THE HOMELESS ARE INFRASTRUCTURE. GOES INTO THE HOUSING ELEMENT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. THE. IS THAT CORRECT FOR THE PRESIDENT THE- SENATE BOOK BORDERS ARE YOU ASKING ANOTHER QUESTION THIS IS TYLER CODES OF FOLLOW UP TO THE FIRST QUESTION MISTER PRESIDENT AND ALL STOP HERE. ARE THE UNDER SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY YEAR OLD HOUSING ELEMENT LAW CITIES HAVE TO IDENTIFY HIS OWN WITHIN THE CITY EXACTLY WHERE A HOUSING WERE HOMELESS SHELTER CAN BE APPROVED AS OF RIGHT SO WE DON'T WAS SO WE STOP HAVING 70% OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA SLEEPING ON THE STREETS INSTEAD OF SLEEPING IN A SHELTER AND SO THE- BILL. PROVIDES THAT YOU CAN'T DAM THAT REQUIRE MEN BY LOCATING A TWENTY EIGHT MILES OUTSIDE OF TOWN WHERE HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE NEVER GOING TO BE EVEN PHYSICALLY ABLE TO GO HOMELESS PEOPLE DON'T TO FOR SOME HAVE CARS BECAUSE THEY SLEEP IN THEIR CARS OTHERS DON'T AND IT'S ABOUT PUTTING GARDRAILS AROUND THAT YES IT'S CONTROVERSIAL THAT'S WHY THIS LAW WAS WRITTEN TWENTY YEARS AGO. ALL RIGHT. SENATOR GLAZER. I'M ON THE MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I GUESS A AND IT'S A QUESTION AND THE AUTHOR CAN ANSWER TO DISCLOSE IF HE WISHES BUT THESE HOW THE ELEMENTS ARE THINGS THAT CHANGE THAT THERE'S THE FIFTH CYCLE THE SIX PACK OF WHO KNOWS WHAT COMES. AND I HAVE HEARD FROM BY CITIES HAVE CHALLENGING IT IS. TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S COMING AROUND THE CORNER. NEXT YEAR. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT- HE COULD SPEAK TO THAT- ISSUE OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. TO COMPLY BECAUSE- THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THE FULLY. FOR SMALLER COMMUNITIES. THE SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE THAT. I DON'T SEE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES HAS WAITED ON THIS LEGISLATION AND I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SHARE WITH US THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE HAD WITH THEM SO THAT WE CAN BE ELIMINATED BY THAT CONVERSATION WHERE IT HAS LANDED. LIGHTLY. SO I. OF THE PRESENT. ON SECRET. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES LEAGUE OF CITIES HAS NOT. TO MY KNOWLEDGE OPPOSED- THIS BILL- I'VE NOT SEEN IT- AT LEAST- BECAUSE THIS BILL IS NOT ANY KIND OF. DICEY IT IS IT IS A BELT AND SUSPENDERS. APPROACH TO SAYING WE HAVE THIS HOUSING ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR FIFTY YEARS. ALWAYS SAY TO CITIES IS YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PLANNING PROCESS AND PLAN FOR GROWTH. AND PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS AND WE HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING. FOR PEOPLE. HI AND OVER TIME UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE CITIES THAT AVOID THAT REQUIREMENT IN DIFFERENT WAYS- AND SOMETIMES DON'T EVEN APPROVED A HOUSING ELEMENT ALL WERE WERE PROVE IT YEARS. LADY AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SAY WE HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT EDITION MEANS SOMETHING- SO THAT THAT'S REALLY. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT NOW IN TERMS OF RESOURCES I COULDN'T AGREE MORE- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO STOP OP ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE. THE GENERAL FUND LIKE A LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO- OR IN OAKLAND TO BE ABLE TO HELP AND ACTUALLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE NINE. AND SENATE BILL TWO THAT WAS AUTHORED BY OUR- PRO TEM- SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE IS A POT OF MONEY IN SENATE BILL TWO. OR PLANNING GRANTS FOR CITIES. FOUND IN ADDITION AND I KNOW IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET OBVIOUSLY THE BUDGET SO DIFFERENT POSITION THIS YEAR BUT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S FIRST PROPOSED BUDGET THAT WE AGREED WITH. WE PUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS INTO THE BUDGET TO PROVIDE PLANNING GRANTS FOR CITIES FOR SMALLER CITIES TO HELP THEM GROW THROUGH THEIR- YOU KNOW THE CITIES THAT HAVE AN UPDATED- ZONING AND FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS I NEED HELP WITH A HOUSING ELEMENT. SO WE HAVE STEPPED UP AS THE STATE I'M SURE WE CAN ALWAYS DO MORE BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE I FULLY AGREE WITH THE SENATOR FROM AROUND THE- THIS PRESIDENT ON MY OWN TIME I KNOW THE AUTHOR'S HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND HE IDENTIFIES. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I SHARE. THE GOALS THAT HE HAS AND I GUESS I WOULD SAY GOING FORWARD I HOPE THAT- YOU'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE OF FUNDING YES THERE WAS RESOURCES PUT ASIDE BUT ARE THEY THERE. AND AS WE KNOW THESE HOUSING ELEMENTS KEEP COMING AROUND EVERY FOUR TO. EIGHT YEARS- THERE CREATING STRESSFUL THAT'S NOT BECAUSE- EXTENT NECESSARILY OF WHAT'S BEEN REQUIRED BUT WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED. AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE SET CLEAR DEADLINES. IT COULD BE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE EMERGENCY SHELTER ISSUE BUT SIMPLY. OTHER LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE A FLOATER CITIES. IN THEIR ABILITY TO SO. COMPLY AS IT'S DEFINED SO I WOULD ASSESS AS YOU GO FORWARD TO. CONSIDER WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN HELP THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST WORK- GIVEN THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT THEY- MAY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. SINGER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. WHAT THE AUTHOR IS REFERRING TO ARE SB TWO ZONES. EVERY CITY AS A GENERAL PLAN IN EVERY GENERAL PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE AN SP TWO ZONE WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A YEAR ROUND. HOMELESS SHELTER. THAT'S IN THE LAW CURRENTLY. THE TROUBLE IS BEEN THE IMPLEMENTATION. FOR CITY COUNCIL IS TO FIND A LOCATION- IT HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT TASK BOB AS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR MYSELF- WE LOCATED A FACILITY IN THE CITY OF FULLERTON. AND OPEN THE ESCROW ONLY THEN TO HAVE THE CITY COUNCIL BE BOMBARDED AND PRESSURED HIM BY ONE VOTE WE LOST THAT FACILITY VERY DIFFICULT TIME THE THEN WORKED WITH THE CITY OF SANTA ANA. TRY TO GET THEM TO FIND A FACILITY OR LOCATION THEY PICK THE SITE THAT BAFFLED ME BUT IT WASN'T CLOSE TO WHERE THE HOMELESS WERE BUT THEN ALL THE NEIGHBORS AROUND THAT. SITE THAT WE OPENED ESCROW ON- CONVINCED THE CITY COUNCIL THAT. THAT WOULDN'T WORK SO WE LOST THAT OPPORTUNITY. WE FINALLY FIND A LOCATION IN THE CITY OF ANAHEIM CLOSE TO THE FREEWAY AND- NOW YOU WOULD EVEN KNOW WAS THERE IF YOU DIDN'T. GET OFTEN DRIVE AROUND BUT IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A WELL RUN FACILITY. BUT THIS IS A DIFFICULT ASSIGNMENT FOR CITY COUNCILS. SMALL CITIES I'VE HAD HIM IN MY OFFICE AND I'VE ASKED THEM IN LA COUNTY. WE'RE LIKE LOW MEDIA WHERE WHERE IS YOUR- SB TO ZONE THEY SAY WELL WE'RE ONLY A SQUARE MILE. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PLACE WE COULD PUT A HOMELESS SHELTER. AS WELL THEN WHERE ARE YOU BRINGING YOUR HOMELESS PEOPLE. TO THE CITY NEXT DOOR THEY HAVE A SHELTER THEN. ARE YOU REIMBURSING THEM AT ALL FOR THE COSTS CAN YOU. COOPERATE TOGETHER SO THAT YOUR SB TWO ZONE IS ACTUALLY BEING MET BY A NEIGHBORING CITY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL LANDER OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FOR AN SP TWO ZONE. SO WITH THAT. I AGREE WITH THE SENATE PURMEREND OF WHAT CAN WE DO. THANK COURAGE. OUR CITIES AND- YOU KNOW HONORING THE SP TWO ZONE WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE HOMELESS AND THERE ARE SOME INCREDIBLE MODELS. AROUND THIS STATE AND AROUND THIS COUNTRY AND I VISITED PLENTY OF THEM BUT HOW DO WE HELP. CITY COUNCILS TO ADDRESS THE REACTION AND HOW DO WE SHOW THEM. THAT THEY CAN WORK NEXT TO CERTAIN AREAS IT IT'S OUR MESSAGING IT'S A COMMUNICATION ANSWER PERSUADING ISSUE AND SO- WE HAVE WE HAVE- ARMORIES THAT ARE OPEN IN THE WINTER. AND IN SANTA ANA THE NEIGHBOR SAID WELL WE DON'T WANT THIS WE DON'T KNOW HOMELESS SHELTER BECAUSE THIS NEXT TO THE SCHOOLS. WELL THE ARMORY THE FENCE ABOUT THE SCHOOL AND IN THIS GOING ON FOR DECADES AND NO ONE HAS EVER. MADE AN ISSUE THAT IS SO IF IT'S WELL RUN AND IT'S WELL MANAGED. IT ALL WORKS SO I WOULD JUST. REPEAT WHAT THE SENATOR FROM ORINDA. SAID IS. WE NEED TO ONE WE GET IT WE GOT IT ENCOURAGE THEM TO COMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING BUT TO HOW DO WE HELP THEM. IN THAT ENDEAVOR SO THAT IT ISN'T. OVERBEARING BUT IT'S COMING UP UNDER ME EVEN HELPING THESE CITIES TO MEET THIS CRITICAL NEED AND SO I I'M I'M I'M WITH THE BILL I WAS THERE IN COMMITTEE. I THINK THIS HAS TO BE DONE IT'S IT SHOULD BE A LOCAL LEPER BUT BUT WE SHOULD SEE HOW WE CAN BE THERE TO HELP OUT THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RATE ON THIS ITEM. SEEN NO MORE MIKE'S UP SOONER WINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER PRESS OFFICER TO DO. OF ALL THE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER PRESIDENT OF FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THIS DEBATE. IT'S A GOOD THING WHEN WE HAVE A ROBUST DEBATE ABOUT HOMELESSNESS ON THE FLOOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DEBATED AT AN OFFICE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER ANNOUNCED AND WE HAVE AN ARTICLE WE GRAPPLED. WITH THE ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY. AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE STATE THAT AS I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING THAT ONE HALF 50% OF ALL ON SHELTERED AMERICANS. OUR RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE HALF OF ALL ON SHELTERED HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ARE RESIDENTS OF THE PROGRESSIVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND RESISTANCE TO HOMELESS SHELTERS. IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE THERE ARE PARTISAN ISSUES IN THIS BODY THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM. I WILL TELL YOU THAT RESISTANCE TO HOMELESS SHELTERS IN SAN FRANCISCO IS EVERY BIT AS INTENSE. TO RESISTANCE IN ORANGE COUNTY OR FRESNO COUNTY OR LOS ANGELES OR ANYWHERE ELSE THERE IS NO PLACE IN THIS STATE THAT I'M AWARE OF. WHERE PEOPLE GET UP AND SAY PLEASE BRING A HOMELESS SHELTER AND TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I'M I CAME UP THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE SEEN. THE UGLINESS OF IT EVERYONE EVEN OUR MOST PROGRESSIVE BASTIONS IN THIS STATE. TALK ABOUT THE TALK A GOOD GAME. ABOUT SOLVING HOMELESSNESS BUT WHEN IT COMES TIME TO DO SOMETHING. NOT HERE. THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND ALL OUR STATE LAW DOES ALL WE'RE ASKING. IS JUST DESIGNATE AN AREA OF YOUR CITY YOU GET TO PICK WHERE IT IS DESIGNATED AREA WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS MASSIVE MELTDOWN MEGAFIGHT RESULTING IN LITIGATION EVERYWHERE ELSE DESIGNATED ZONE. AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING TODAY IS THAT WHEN YOU DESIGNATE THAT ZONE. DON'T SPAM IT. PUT IT SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SIGN A HOMELESS SHELTER YOU GET TO PICK WHERE. BUT DON'T PUT IT TWENTY MILES OUTSIDE OF THE CITY DON'T PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A REMOTE INDUSTRIAL AREA DON'T PUT IT SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE'S NOT A SQUARE INCH TO BUILD ANYTHING. YOU HAVE TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE. WE HAVE A SEVERE SHELTER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE ENTIRE COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE SHELTER BED. COUNTIES THAT ONLY HAVE WINTER SHELTERS. TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE YOUTH SPECIFIC HOMELESS SHELTERS AND SO GUESS WHERE THOSE KIDS ARE GOING NOT WITH THE ADULTS. BEAR SO STE AND SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ACTUALLY TAKE A STEP TODAY THIS ISN'T GOING TO OVERNIGHT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT THIS WILL HELP AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM LAKE ELSINORE. YES THE STATE CAN DO MORE BUT LET'S BE CLEAR THE STATE DOESN'T MAKE THESE LAND USE DECISIONS THE STATE DOESN'T SITE HOMELESS SHELTERS THAT CITIES AND UNLESS WE HAVE ACTUAL PARAMETERS AND RULES FOR THE CITIES TO DO THAT THE SHELTERS ARE NOT GOING TO GET CITED AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS SHAME. THAT IS WITHIN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF ON SHELTER HOMELESSNESS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.
