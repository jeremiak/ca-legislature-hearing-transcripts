THE STATE. WE'VE SEEN HIGH

00:23:26.404 --> 00:23:29.307

WE KNOW THAT- IT IS THE

00:23:36.982 --> 00:23:38.984
COMBINATION OF VACCINES. AND

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.687
BOOSTERS AND MASKING- AND SOCIAL

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.422
DISTANCE THAT HAS WILL BE HELL

DISTANCING AT SCHOOLS RIGHT

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:53.165
SCHOOLS ARE NOT. BUILT FOR

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:54.666
MAINTAINING A LOT OF THIS AND SO

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.001
THE MASKING. HAS BECOME

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:57.736
IMPORTANT AND THE MAN IN THE

00:23:57.803 --> 00:24:00.505
VACCINES ARE IMPORTANT AND SO-

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:01.840
AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:04.242
HEALTH IS IN A POSITION TO-

00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:05.977
ROLLOUT WHAT IS A PROPOSED

VACCINE MANDATE. THAT MANY

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:10.782
ANTICIPATE WOULD GO INTO EFFECT-

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:13.652
PROBABLY BY JULY THIS BY THE WAY

00:24:13.718 --> 00:24:16.087
THE BACKSEAT MANDATE. IS WRITTEN

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:17.889
AND SPELLED OUT THAT IT HAS TO

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:19.491
ALIGN WITH CERTAIN APPROVALS

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:21.426
THAT WOULD COME FROM- YOU KNOW

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.461
THE FDA AND- OTHER EALTH

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:25.430
ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT AT THOSE

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:27.933
TIMES. THAT VACCINE THAT THE

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:30.101
COLD WITH NINETEEN VACCINE COULD

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.437
BECOME LIKE THE OTHER- VACCINES

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:33.839
THAT ARE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:36.808
IMMUNIZATION. SCHEDULE AND SO-

00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:39.578
THAT IS- THAT IS WHAT IS BEEN

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:42.147
OUTLINED- TO IT AND TO BE

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:43.481
IMPLEMENTED ADMINISTRATIVELY OF

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:44.816
COURSE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS

00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:46.918
LEGISLATION PENDING- WERE

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:49.855
INTRODUCED- IN THE SENATE- THAT

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:52.324
COULD GO INTO EFFECT AND- SOONER

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.093
I SHOULD THE ACTOR LEGISLATION-

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.129
BE. SIGNED INTO LAW- BUT- IT IS

00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:00.031
ANTICIPATED THAT THERE WILL BE A

00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:02.500
VACCINE MANDATE LIKELY BY JULY.

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:04.636
OF COURSE STUDENTS IN GRADES

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:07.305
SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE- AGAIN THIS

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:09.107
WHOLE THE VACCINE MANDATE THAT

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:11.376
WOULD COME THROUGH- THIS PART OF

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:14.379
HEALTH AND- IT LARGELY FOLLOWS-

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:20.452
APPROVALS OF THE. VACCINES AND

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:21.853
SO WE WAIT AND WE WATCH. IN THE

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.388
MEANTIME WE EVERY CAN YOU GET A

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:24.990
- BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT DATA

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:26.258
THAT HAVE SEEN IS THAT HOSPITALS

00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:27.259
OF HIGHER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH

00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:28.960
THAT VARIOUS VARIANTS THAT WE

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:30.896
SEE NOW IS KOBE WE ALSO KNOW

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:32.330
THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT. THOSE WHO

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:34.032
EXPERIENCED THE MOST SERIOUS

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:37.302
CONDITIONS FROM KOBE- EXACTION

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.070
HAVE BEEN THOSE WITH OUT OF

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:41.239
VACCINE IN THAT SADLY THAT SOME

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:42.507
OF THOSE SERIOUS CONDITIONS HAVE

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.910
BEEN DEATH. AND SO- WE ENCOURAGE

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:46.978
EVERYONE WHO CAN'T GET A VACCINE

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.113
IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR A BOOSTER

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:50.215
TO DO SO AGAIN IF NOTHING ELSE

00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:51.883
THEY HELP KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.485
AND KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES OPEN.

00:25:53.551 --> 00:25:54.419
FOR ME IT'S NOT ABOUT THE

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:56.354
MANDATE AT ALL THIS IS NOT ABOUT

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:57.022
TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN AND

00:25:57.088 --> 00:25:59.257
CANNOT DO. SIMPLY THIS IS ABOUT

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:00.825
HOW WE KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN HOW

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.060
DO WE KEEP OUR BUSINESSES OPEN

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:06.831
IN OUR COMMUNITIES OPEN. AND OUR

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:07.966
ABILITY TO BE AROUND OUR LEVELS.

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:10.402
THANK YOU THANK YOU- RENTAL. AND

00:26:10.468 --> 00:26:12.637
ONE LAST QUESTION- WE'VE HEARD

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:14.105
QUITE A BIT OF CONCERNS WITH

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:16.074
REGARDS TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:17.342
ON MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS AND I.

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.376
SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:19.244
EXPERIENCE FROM OUR SCHOOL

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.880
DISTRICT- AND IF MONEY IS BEING

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:24.416
ALLOCATED TO THAT. TO THAT-

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:26.985
SPACE. GIVE ANY THOUGHTS IN THIS

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.320
BUDGET AND WHETHER OR NOT WE

00:26:28.386 --> 00:26:29.354
SHOULD BE FOCUSING MORE ON

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:31.923
THOSE- ON FUNDS THAT WILL.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.525
MITIGATE THE DEFERRED.

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.093
MAINTENANCE FOR MANY MANY OF THE

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.828
SCHOOLS WHO I IN I DON'T HAVE A

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:39.397
TOTAL AMOUNT FOR OUR K. TWELVE

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:40.598
SCHOOLS BUT- TO READ THE

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:43.001
ALLOCATING MORE MONEY TO. OUR

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:44.235
INFRASTRUCTURE TO OUR TO OUR- IN

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:47.472
SCHOOLS. THE SHARES ARE SENATOR

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:48.840
I BELIEVE IS YES THAT WE SHOULD

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:50.342
BE ALLOCATING MORE TO OUR

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:51.943
SCHOOLS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE MANY

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.012
OLD SCHOOLS AND YOU KNOW I AYE

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:55.613
AYE SIR GO TO SCHOOL BOARD IN A

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.649
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE HAD

00:26:57.716 --> 00:26:59.784
A WE HAD TO USE OUR OWN UP ON

00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:02.587
PROGRAMS IT- TO THE TO DO MUCH

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:04.622
OF THAT MODERNIZATION AND IT IS

00:27:04.689 --> 00:27:06.291
TYPICALLY MORE THAN MOST SCHOOL

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:08.393
DISTRICTS CAN DO AND MANY SCHOOL

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.028
DISTRICTS ARE IN AREAS WHERE FOR

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:11.997
WHATEVER REASON. CITIZENS AREN'T

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:13.698
WILLING TO VOTE TO PAY FOR BOND

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.700
MEASURES AND SO THIS BUDGET IS

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:17.335
THOUGHTFUL AND THAT IT OFFERS

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:18.036
YOU KNOW MORE THAN A BILLION

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:20.672
DOLLARS- THAT CAN BE USED FOR A

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:23.942
SCHOOL FACILITIES- IT BUILDS ON-

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:25.577
WHAT IS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:28.346
AND FROM AB EIGHTY SIX THAT

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:29.614
ALSO. IN OTHER BOB BUT IF YOU

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.716
DID SAY GAVE FUNDING TO SCHOOLS

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:33.251
DID YOU VERY STRATEGIC

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:35.553
MODERNIZATION AROUND VENTILATION

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.955
WE KNOW THAT IS- IMPORTANT

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:40.225
MITIGATION STRATEGY- FOR- FOR

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:42.560
KEEPING US ALL SAFE FROM KOBE-

00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:44.429
BUT THERE ARE MANY WHO BELIEVE

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.631
THAT EVEN AFTER EVEN IF THE

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.867
BILLION PLUS THAT IS PROPOSED IN

00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:51.903
THIS BUDGET- IS APPROVED THAT

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.171
THEY WILL PROBABLY NEED TO BE

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:57.342
ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS FOR SCHOOLS

00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:58.710
WOULD JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A- A

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:00.645
TOP ISSUE- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:02.280
THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE ACCESS. TO

00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:03.982
THE TOP FACILITIES TO PREPARE

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:05.550
OUR STUDENTS FOR THE JOBS OF

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:06.785
TOMORROW THAT ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.119
SHOULD HAVE A MAKERS SPACE ALL

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:09.354
OF OUR SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:12.090
ACCESS TO STEAM AND STAMP- YOU

00:28:12.157 --> 00:28:15.160
KNOW THEY SHOULD- HAVE ACCESS TO

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.095
UPGRADE TECHNOLOGY- TO MAKE SURE

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:18.263
THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE READY FOR

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:20.565
THE JOBS OF TOMORROW AND SO- I

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:22.300
BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS IN THIS

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:25.637
BUDGET IS A VERY GOOD START- BUT

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:26.938
IT WOULD SEEM THAT- AT. THAT

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:28.273
CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS WILL PROBABLY

00:28:28.339 --> 00:28:30.241
GO BEYOND THAT- BUT THIS IS AN

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:31.976
EXCELLENT START OF WHAT IS IN

00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:37.682
THIS BUDGET AND- WE HOPE TO SEE

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:38.683
IT APPROVED. THANK YOU. THANK

KINDERGARTNER- AND IT THEIR

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:54.799
SCHOOL AND I KNOW THIS IS AN

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:55.800
ANECDOTE AND I KNOW THAT THE

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:57.469
PLURAL OF ANECDOTE IS NOT DATA

00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:59.804
AS THEY SAY BUT- IN MY KIDS

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:02.240
SCHOOL- THE KIDS DO GENERALLY

00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:04.109
FOLLOW THE MASS MANDATE- IT'S

00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:05.710
NOT A 100% YOU SEE YOU SEE A LOT

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:07.512
OF KIDS WITH THEIR MASKS DOWN

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.013
OR- BLOW THEIR NOSE A LOT OF

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.781
TIMES THEIR- RUN AROUND WITHOUT

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:11.316
MASKS AT ALL. OF THE TEACHERS

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:12.851
WHO TRIED AND FORCE THAT THE

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:13.585
SCHOOL WORKERS TRY TO ENFORCE

00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:16.488

AND WE KNOW THE KIDS DO IT- WE

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.028
DON'T HAVE A 100% FORSMAN BUT- I

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.296
THINK JUST CREATING THE NORM

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.565
THAT IS GENERALLY ENFORCED THAT

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:29.134
KIDS WERE MASS IS IMPORTANT.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.368
BECAUSE AS A SUPERINTENDENT

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:33.404
POINTED OUT- EVERY TIME YOU HAVE

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:34.739
ANOTHER COVERED EXPOSURE IT

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:36.107
CREATES THE RISK THAT THE SCHOOL

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:37.609
MIGHT HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THAT

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:39.177
KIDS WILL HAVE TO BE QUARANTINED

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:40.345
AND WE KNOW THAT THE LEARNING

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:42.113
LOSS AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH ISSUES

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.949
ASSOCIATED WITH- NOT BEING IN

GET BACK IN SCHOOL I THINK THAT

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:55.793
IS IMPORTANT AND THIS IS

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.629
SUPERINTENDENT POINTED OUT- THIS

OUR WHEN WE WERE IN THE BUDGET

00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:21.346

COMPLETELY. A REOPEN SCHOOLS

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:33.524
WITHOUT ANY FLEXIBILITY AND WE

00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:36.961
STILL HAD A FEW. BOB PARENTS WHO

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.997
HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR KIDS

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:41.633
COMING BACK TO SCHOOL AND WE

00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:45.036
REALLY WERE NERVOUS. BOB THAT WE

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:46.104
WOULD BE IN A POSITION OF

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.639
FUNDING DECLINING ENROLLMENT IF

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:50.275
THERE WASN'T SOME OPTION FOR

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:52.844
PARENTS TO HAD CONCERNS DID NOT

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.146
HAVE THEIR KIDS DROP OUT OF THE

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:57.548
PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND THE

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:59.484
SO IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WHAT

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.054
WAS NEGOTIATED AS AN OPTION. IT

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:05.757
WAS A REGULATED INDEPENDENT

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:08.126
STUDY PROGRAM AND THAT WAS

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:12.530
APPROVED AND AT THE- AND WE MADE

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.499
SOME TWEAKS TO IT. IN THE FINAL

00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:16.267
WEEKS OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:18.069
IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE FIRST

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:21.205
FEEDBACK THAT WAS HEARD FOR ME

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:23.174
THAT MIGHT NOT OF BEEN MY FIRST

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:25.476
CHOICE AS THE ALTERNATIVE BUT

00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:28.212
GIVEN THE CONCERNS. THAT SOMEHOW

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:31.516
WE WERE GIVING AN OUT TO PEOPLE

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:34.352
OR SCHOOL BOARDS TO NOT RE OPEN

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:36.554
INDEPENDENT STUDY WAS REALLY

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.323
DECIDED AS THE ALTERNATIVE. AND

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:43.161
SO BUT NOW WE HAVE GONE THROUGH-

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:45.129
A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE SCHOOL

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:46.264
YEAR WITH THAT IS THE

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:48.700
ALTERNATIVE AND WE WILL BE

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.802
FACING SOME DECISION. A WHEN WE

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:52.904
GO TO THE MAY REVISED IN JUNE

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.539
ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE IT

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:58.409
WHETHER TO TWEAK IT WHAT TO DO

00:32:58.476 --> 00:32:59.177
AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.646
THAT. WE HAVE WE KNOW RIGHT NOW

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:03.581
WE'RE THE PANDEMIC IS BUT WE

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.316
DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WILL BE IN

00:33:05.383 --> 00:33:08.019
MAY AND- SO THIS HEARING IS

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:09.654
DESIGNED TO JUST HAVE A

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:11.389

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:17.628
START TO THINK OF CHANGES IN

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:19.497
ANTICIPATION OF JUST BEING READY

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:21.733
THIS IS NOT A DECISION THIS DOES

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:23.601

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:25.970
TURNS OUT PANDEMIC IT'S A LOT

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.638
BETTER BETWEEN NOW AND MAY. BUT

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:29.140

ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THE PANDEMIC

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:53.284
OF ONE CAN CALL IT THAT. TO HAVE

00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:55.520
THE ABILITY TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:57.989

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:07.365
HELPS STUDENTS STAY CONNECTED

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:08.332
WITH THE SCHOOL WITH THEIR

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.167
ASSIGNMENTS WITH THEIR TEACHERS

00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:10.902
AND CLASSMATES AND WHAT THEY'RE

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:13.571
DOING. AND FOR FAMILIES TO DO

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:14.906
HAVE IMMUNO COMPROMISED A

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:17.208
MEMBERS OR STUDENTS THEMSELVES

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:21.078
THEY ARE ABLE. TO CONTINUE TO

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:22.179
STAY IN PUBLIC SCHOOL. THERE ARE

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:24.482
CHALLENGES WE IDENTIFIED-

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:27.385
COLLECTIVELY- SAY SAYS EVERY SO

00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:33.558
TO MY COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW. THAT

00:36:33.624 --> 00:36:35.192
I WAS SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:37.895
MENTIONED EARLIER- DOING THIS

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:39.797
WAS ASKED OF US ON TOP OF AN

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.033
ALREADY STRETCHED THIN WORKFORCE

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:43.267
THAT IS GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:44.936
TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN. SOME

00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:46.771
F THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:49.006
HAS BEEN- IMPOSING BURDENSOME

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:50.775
PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS THAT.

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:52.410
REALLY ARE NOT ABOUT IMPROVING

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:53.945
OUR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:55.112
HAVE DISTRACTED MANY OF THE

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:56.948
SCHOOL STEP CONST. WITH

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.382
PROVIDING THESE EDUCATIONAL

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:00.117
SERVICES ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:02.153
CHALLENGES IS TIMING. WHAT THE

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:03.788
STUDENT IS DEEMED POSITIVE FOR

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:04.922
COVERT FOR EXAMPLE THERE

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.824
IMMEDIATELY SENT HOME. AND

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:08.693
SOMETIMES WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.828
AND- SHORT TERM INDEPENDENT

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.530
STUDY POCKET TAT CAN BE SAID

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:14.265
WITH THEM. MANY TIMES THEY HAVE

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:15.766
TO GET THAT PACKET LATER WHEN

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.835
THE TEACHER HAS HAD TIME. TO PUT

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:20.037
IT TOGETHER OF COURSE TEACHERS

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:22.473
TEACH- ON A DAILY BASIS BUT

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.574
THEIR LESSON PLANS CHANGE

00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:25.776
ACCORDING TO STUDENT NEED. TO

00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:27.044
HOW MUCH THEY WERE ABLE TO GET

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.412
DONE THAT DAY IN PUTTING

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:29.580
TOGETHER HESE POCKETS IT IS

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:31.315
TIME CONSUMING AND IT DOES TAKE

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:33.551
TIME. AGAIN USING A LEARNING

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:34.719
MANAGEMENT PLATFORM HELPS SOME

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:37.555
OF THAT- EFFORT BUT IT DOES TAKE

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:39.223
TIME FOR THEM TO PUT IT

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.224
TOGETHER. WHAT THE LATEST A

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:42.426
SEARCHABLE MACRON WE HAD CLASSES

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:45.062
WHERE MAYBE- ONE FOURTH OF THE

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:46.697
STUDENT BODY WAS GONE HALF OF

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.065
THE STUDENTS WERE GONE FOR

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:53.471
SEVERAL DAYS. FIVE EIGHT DAYS

00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:54.438
DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY COULD

00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:56.841
RETURN- THE NEXT TO THE TIME WE

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:58.275
HAVE TO SURE THAT PARENTS ARE IN

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:00.478
OR SIGN WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY DAYS

00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:02.480
TO DO THAT AND THAT CAN BE TOUGH

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:03.948
TO DO IN A TIMELY WITH TIMELY

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:05.916
WAY ESPECIALLY APPARENT YOU KNOW

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:07.885
FINDS OUT OF THAT THEIR CHILD

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.221
HAS A POSITIVE CASE THEY HAVE TO

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:11.656
REALLY ATTEND TO THAT IN THEIR

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:13.391
HOUSEHOLD IF THERE'S MULTIPLE

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.593
FAMILIES LIVING THERE THAT TAKE

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.261
SOME OF THEIR ATTENTION AWAY SO

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.163
COORDINATING ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.098
IN A TIMELY WAY. TO MAKE SURE

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:21.999
THAT WE'RE MEETING THE

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:23.601
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.803
POTENTIALLY A FUTURE AUDIT

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.739
REQUIREMENTS- DOES TAKE A LOT OF

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.808
EFFORT AND TIME FROM WORK AGAIN

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:33.377
ALREADY BEEN STOPPED- WE WANT TO

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:34.845
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THOROUGHLY

00:38:34.912 --> 00:38:37.181
LEARN THE RECORDING SIGNING IN

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:39.917
DATING OF ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTS

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:43.354
SO WE HAVE- THAT RECOMMENDATION

00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:45.856
TO MAYBE STEAM A STREAMLINED THE

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:48.359
SIGNATURE PROCESS MAYBE CONSIDER

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.593
HAVING PASSIVE CONSENT FOR

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.629
FAMILIES WITH ONLY ONE SIGNATORY

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:54.432
FOR THE SCHOOL AND THEN- YOU

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:56.867
KNOW I FOUND OUT JUST AND I HAD

00:38:56.934 --> 00:38:58.035
TO COME FROM THIS OF MY STAFF.

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.136
STUDENT SIGNATURES ARE ALSO

00:38:59.203 --> 00:39:00.738
REQUIRED WHEN WE DO THESE

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:03.140
INDEPENDENT STUDY- CONTRACTS AND

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:04.475
AGREEMENTS AND WE'RE TALKING

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.410
ABOUT A- KATE THROUGH TWELVE

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:07.778
SCHOOL SYSTEM SO WE THINK THAT

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:10.247
MAY BE CONSIDERING SOME OF THE

00:39:10.314 --> 00:39:12.683
OLDER STUDENTS- BE NICE TO SIDE

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.584
BUT NOT NECESSARILY OUR

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:15.653
ELEMENTARY STUDENTS AGAIN THAT

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.255
TAKES A LOT OF TIME- THIS IS A

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:19.623
BIT ESPECIALLY HARD AND I WOULD

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.925
BE REMISS IF I WAS A

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:22.126
SUPERINTENDENT IN MENTION

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.161
FAMILIES WHO LIMITED LANGUAGE AN

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:26.263
ARCTIC ABILITIES- BECAUSE THIS

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.832
DOES CREATE ANOTHER BARRIER ONCE

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:29.667
AGAIN MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:31.769
TO DO. IT WE WANT TO KEEP THE

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:33.537
VIRUS OUT IS STUDENTS IN SCHOOL

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:35.306
WE REALLY SHOULDN'T- HAVE

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:36.807
BARRIERS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:39.176
COMING EITHER TO GET TRANSLATION

00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:41.645
SERVICES IN OUR TECH SUPPORT TO

00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:43.013
BE ABLE TO SIGN OFF ON SOME OF

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.116
THESE AGREEMENTS AND TEACHERS

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.350
HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME OF

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.852
COURSE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:49.854
TO TRANSLATE ALL OF THESE

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:57.928
INDEPENDENT STUDY AGREE SENATE.

00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:58.796
AGREEMENT POCKETS OF WORK- WHICH

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.898
MAKE IT ALMOST. EMPIRE FOR

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.433
FAMILY WHO DON'T ON TO THE TRY

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.734
TO THERE'S TO. AT HOME TO

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:06.403
COMPLETE OF THIS OUR- WORK PACK

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:09.473
EVERY. BRING IS THAT OF A

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.075
REUNIFIED WE HAVE ONE PRINCIPLE

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.676
THAT HAS SOME OF THE MOST FOUR

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:13.711
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STUDENTS AND

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:14.912
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:16.914
MORE. WORK WHAT WE'RE REQUIRED

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.182
TO GO INTO SHORT TERM QUARANTINE

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:21.051
RIGHT WHEN WE CAME BACK IN FROM-

00:40:21.118 --> 00:40:23.220
DISTANT WITH HER BREAK AND THE

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:24.789
STUDENTS WERE IN THEIR LAST AND

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.590
GROUP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE TO

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:29.193
FOURTEEN DAYS- IN INDEPENDENT

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.329
SHORT. TERM STUDY AGAIN THIS IS

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.165
AN EXAMPLE OF THE BIG IMPACT

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:37.001
THAT THE ONLY CRIME HAD ON WHO

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:38.068
WAS ABLE TO BE IN SCHOOL AND WHO

00:40:38.135 --> 00:40:39.837
WAS NOT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS A

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:40.871
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THERE

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:42.239
WAS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.307
STUDENTS THAT FELL INTO THAT

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:45.843
CATEGORY. SO LOTS OF REQUIRED

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.511
TIMELINES TO OVERCOME IN

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:51.182
PAPERWORK. THAT IS SOMETIMES

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:53.083
OVERWHELMING- THIS TIME- WE FEEL

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.618
ALSO MAYBE NEED TO BE

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:58.489
RECONSIDERED- WE KNOW THAT THERE

00:40:58.556 --> 00:41:01.125
WAS A THREE TO FOURTEEN DAY TIME

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.993
LIMIT. I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.697
pCRIME WOULD COME THROUGH AND

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.199
CREATE SUCH A WAVE THE

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:09.700
REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR CUMULATIVE

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:12.603
ATTENDANCE SO THE YOU A STUDENT-

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.338
UNDER ONLY CRYING COULD REACH

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:15.673
THAT FIFTEEN DAY LIMIT VERY

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:20.578
QUICKLY- WHICH AGAIN MAKES IT-

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:22.813
CREATES ANOTHER SET OF PAPERWORK

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.015
. A LONG TERM INDEPENDENT STUDY

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:27.151
AFTER THE FIFTEEN DAYS BURNING

00:41:27.218 --> 00:41:29.486
THROUGH THOSE FIFTEEN DAYS- ALSO

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:32.890
GO BECOMES AN ISSUE ESPECIALLY

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:33.557
IF THEY HAVE CLOSE CONTACTS THAT

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:35.526
THEN. YOU KNOW GET INFECTED A

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:38.329
COUPLE OF DAYS LATER- IT CAN

00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:41.332
BECOME A CYCLE OF- REALLY

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:43.634
DEPENDENCY ON STAYING OUT OF

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.536
SCHOOL FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:48.005
TIME. WE KNOW THAT- SCHOOLS CAN

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:51.141
LOSE ADA IF- WORK SEEING THAT

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.142
FIFTEEN DAY CABIN NOT REALLY

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:54.411
KEEPING. OUR STUDENTS OUT

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:57.281
LONGER- IF WE WANTED TO MAKE

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:59.316
SURE THAT THEY'RE BACK- IF THE

00:41:59.383 --> 00:42:00.818
STUDENT IS SICK WELL THERE IN

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:02.553
THIS ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.556
PERIOD- THAT ALSO ADDS ANOTHER

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.291
BURDEN BECAUSE WE EXPECTED TO

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:09.560
FIELD TO FINISH THERE ARE-

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:10.961
ASSIGNMENTS DURING THAT

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:13.197
ISOLATION. OR QUARANTINE PERIOD

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:14.999
AND SO WE'RE NOT REALLY TAKING

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:17.401
THIS INTO CONSIDERATION OF AS A

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:20.271
HEALTH FIRST INITIATIVE- AGAIN

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:21.906
GOOD INTENTIONS BUT I THINK SOME

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:23.774
OF THE REQUIREMENTS REGULATIONS

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:25.442
MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT IMPOSSIBLE

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:26.243
AND- THEY ARE NOT REALLY

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:31.949
CONSIDERING THE HUMANITY. OF

00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:33.083
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.551
ALL GOING THROUGH- THE OTHER-

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:35.986
THE THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING IS

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:39.690
JUST SOME OF THE- THE COMPLIANCE

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:40.925
CHECKS GETTING IN THE WAY OF THE

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:42.526
TRUE CONNECTION THAT REALLY

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.395
NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN STUDENTS

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:46.030
WHICH IS RIGHT AND TEACHERS

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.031
WHICH IS AT THE HEART OF THIS

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:49.066
LEGISLATION WHICH IS REALLY THAT

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:50.668
THAT PERSONAL CONNECTION. WE

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:52.202
WROTE  LETTER TO OUR SENATOR IN

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:54.872
JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN WE

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.307
ANTICIPATED SOME OF THESE ISSUES

00:42:56.373 --> 00:42:57.675
AND WE ASKED IF WE COULD MAYBE

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.443
REPLACE THE REQUIREMENT FOR ANY

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.844
AGREEMENTS TO BE SIGNED FOR

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:02.780
SHORT TERMS INDEPENDENT STUDY

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:03.747
WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:05.616
AGENCIES TO PROVIDE WRITTEN

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:06.684
NOTICE TO ALL FAMILIES AND

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.653
TEACHERS- AS A WAY TO MITIGATE

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.821
SOME OF THIS BUT BURDEN SOME

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:13.524
PAPERWORK AND- AGAIN TO REPEAT

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.326
OVER HERE STATEMENT. REALLY

00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:16.827

OPTION SO SOMETIMES IT'S

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:38.649

OF MY SUCCESSES WHEN INVESTING

SECONDS OF THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN

ALTHOUGH WE WEREN'T READING IN

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:08.725
PERSON COMMUNICATION WITH OUR

SUPPORT SYSTEM WHEN ADDITIONAL

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:17.034
STAFF. WE'VE ALSO HAD THE

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.469
SUPPORT OF HOUSING OR MATERIALS

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:23.640
SCHOOL SITE WHERE SECRETARY

TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY NEED TO BE

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:41.458
SUPPORTED IN THE PROGRAM.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.126
ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THE PROGRAM

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:44.828
IS THAT I HAVEN'T HAD STUDENTS

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.130
WHO HAVE HAD TO MISS MULTIPLE

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:51.568
DAYS OF INSTRUCTION DUE TO

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:54.037
QUARANTINE FOR ILLNESS. WHEN I

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.439
GO TO THE CHALLENGES THAT I

00:47:55.505 --> 00:47:58.842
FACED THIS YEAR I HAVE IN MY

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:01.878
CLASS I HAD WELL I AM TWENTY TWO

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:05.182
STUDENTS. ABOUT 55% OF MY

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:08.252
STUDENTS WHO ARE NAVIGATING.

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:11.388
THROUGH INDEPENDENT STUDY

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:13.090
WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AT HOME. I

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.491
DON'T HAVE A WAY OF HOLDING

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:16.860
THOSE STUDENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:18.895
THEIR BEST QUALITY WORK

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:21.298
POTENTIAL OF WORK. THROUGH THIS

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:23.166
PLATFORM WITHOUT HAVING ACCESS

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:24.768
OR AT HOME SO THAT'S DEFINITELY

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:27.037
BEEN A CHALLENGE UNFORTUNATELY I

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:29.406
SEE THOSE STUDENTS FALLING

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:32.542
BEHIND ACADEMICALLY. I ALSO HAVE

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:34.811
ABOUT EIGHTY TWENTY TWO OF MY

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:38.849
STUDENTS. 36% WHO ARE IN AN

00:48:38.915 --> 00:48:41.785
ENVIRONMENT THAT ISN'T CONDUCIVE

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:43.754
FOR LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.555
THIS MAY MEAN THEY'RE DISTRACTED

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:48.091
BY BACKGROUND NOISE ADDITIONAL

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:49.926
FAMILY MEMBERS THEY ARE

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:51.995
SUPERVISED SO IT'S VERY

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:53.330
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:57.401
CONCENTRATE OR ENGAGING LESSONS.

00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:00.237
DURING OUR SYNCHRONOUS MEETINGS

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.104
. AND THAT'S MEANING THAT THEY

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:02.773
MISSED SOME OF THE INSTRUCTION

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:06.376
IN CLASS. OVERALL AFTER LOOKING

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:09.313
AT THE- AND SUCCESSES OF THIS

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:11.782
YEAR I DO FEEL THAT IN PERSON

00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:14.117
INSTRUCTION IS MOST EFFECTIVE

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:16.987
FOR STUDENTS AS WE DISCUSSED. I

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:19.456
DO SUPPORT INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:20.424
THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAVE A

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:23.527
MEDICAL NEED OR SUPPORT TO BE

00:49:23.593 --> 00:49:26.163
SUCCESSFUL IN THE PROGRAM I AM

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:20.143
BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.078
THE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:24.247

HONORS IN TWENTY NINETEEN RIGHT

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:30.053
BEFORE. THIS PANDEMIC HIT US. SO

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.788
WHETHER IT'S FULLY- JUST LIKE MY

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:34.224
DAUGHTER SITUATION ORACLE THE

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:36.526
NINETEEN INDEPENDENT STUDY

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:38.195

RIGHT NOW NONE OF MY STUDENTS

ARE PARTICIPATING IN INDEPENDENT

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:59.816
STUDY HOWEVER ON I DO. ON A

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:02.552
DAILY BASIS WE COULD BE INFORMED

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:05.021
OF THE NEEDS FROM SOME OF THE

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:08.158
PARENTS AND ASKED TO SUPPORT.

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:10.126
IT'S HARD TO TELL WHEN WE'RE

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:11.495
GOING TO FEEL THE NEED TO

00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:13.530

FOR DECADES INDEPENDENT STUDY

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:20.203
HAS BEEN A VIABLE OPTION FOR

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:21.938
FAMILIES AND STUDENTS IN A

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:24.074

THROUGH THE REGULATORY AND AUDIT

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:35.752
PROCESS. AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.721
INDEPENDENT STUDY REQUIRES

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:39.055
STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO WORK

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:41.758

SUPPORT OF THEIR FAMILIES AND

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:45.996
SCHOOL STAFF. FOR THIS SCHOOL

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.197
YEAR THE STATE ADDED SOME

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:48.398
ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:49.599
REQUIREMENTS TO INDEPENDENT

FLEXIBILITY OF PROGRAM AND

00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:56.072
MAKING IT MUCH MORE LIKE

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:57.407
DISTANCE LEARNING. K. THREE

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:59.242

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.936
THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS THE RULES

00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:28.738
FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY WERE CLEAR

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:30.941
STUDENTS COULD NOT PARTICIPATE

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:32.108
IN THE PROGRAM IF THEY WEREN'T

00:53:32.175 --> 00:53:33.743
COMPLETING THE WORK FOR MAKING

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.612
PROGRESS ON THEIR ASSIGNMENTS

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:36.913
THERE WERE VERY CLEAR AND

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.082
CONCISE PROCEDURES FROM WHAT WE

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:40.884
HAD TO DO BEFORE INFORMING THE

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.919
STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT

00:53:42.986 --> 00:53:45.488
THEY WERE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:48.224
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:50.527
EXCUSE ME WITH THESE RECENT

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:52.162
CHANGES WE'VE ENCOUNTERED

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:55.599
SEVERAL CHALLENGES. ONE WE ARE

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:56.933
OVERWHELMED WITH THE NUMBER OF

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.668
INDEPENDENT STUDY STUDENTS THAT

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.103
WERE REQUIRED TO CONNECT WITH ON

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:02.706
A DAILY BASIS AND THIS IS IN

00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:04.674
ADDITION TO THE STUDENTS THAT

00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:07.310
WERE SUPPORTING THE CLASSROOM.

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:08.845
TWO WELL WE'RE REQUIRED TO RE

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.847
ENGAGE THE FAMILIES AS WE DID

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.515
DURING DISTANCE LEARNING. THE

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:14.150
STATE HAS NOT DEFINED WHAT

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:16.486
RECOURSE WE HAVE IF FAMILIES ARE

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:18.521
UNABLE OR CHOOSE NOT TO ENGAGE

00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:21.691
IN THE PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE SOME

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:22.892
PARENTS MA NOT BE ABLE TO

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:23.994
PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THEIR

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.495
STUDENTS BECAUSE OF WORK

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:28.398
OBLIGATIONS OR EVEN A LACK OF

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:29.065
UNDERSTANDING IN THE MATERIAL OR

00:54:29.132 --> 00:54:32.235
THE CURRICULUM. THREE WHEN A

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:34.037
STUDENT IS NOT PARTICIPATING AND

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:36.306
OR COMPLETING THEIR COURSEWORK

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:37.507
WE REALLY HAVE NO GUIDANCE ON

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:39.042
THE TIME LINE TO CONTINUE

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.143
KEEPING THE STUDENTS IN

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.345
INDEPENDENT STUDY. VERSUS

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:44.180
REMOVING THEM FROM THE PROGRAM.

00:54:44.247 --> 00:54:45.882
PREVIOUSLY WE WERE ALLOWED TO

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:47.083
REMOVE THE STUDENT FROM

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.452
INDEPENDENT STUDY WHEN THEY

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:50.387
FAILED TO COMPLETE THEIR

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.155
COURSEWORK. WITH THIS PROGRAM

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:55.125
BEING A REQUIRED OPTION NOW WE

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:56.893
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.462
STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM. EVEN IF

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:02.499
THEY FAIL TO ENGAGE PARTICIPATE

00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:07.837
OR COMPLETE THE COURSEWORK. FOR

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.606
ATTENDANCE ISSUES FOR

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:11.307
INDEPENDENT STUDY HAVE NOT BEEN

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:13.810
CLEARLY DEFINED AS THEY RELATE

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:17.247
TO TRUANCY AND THE START PROCESS

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:19.215
AND FINALLY WE EXPEND SO MUCH

00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:21.818
TIME AND RESOURCES FOR OUR

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.687
INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM. SO

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:25.555
WHEN THE STUDENTS AND PARENTS

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:27.657
ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THEIR PART

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.592
WILL THERE BE A LOSS OF FUNDING

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:32.495
WILL WE BE HELD HARMLESS AND

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:34.464
COULD WE BE LOSING THE ADA THESE

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.865
ARE THE HARD CONVERSATIONS THAT

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:38.068
WE'RE HAVING IN ASKING TO GO SHE

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:41.471
ASIANS TABLE. IN CONCLUSION

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:42.939
INDEPENDENT STUDY HAS BEEN AN

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.708
IMPORTANT PART OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:46.810
EDUCATION SYSTEM. THROUGH THIS

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.912
PROGRAM WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.280
EDUCATE STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:52.315
HAVE ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:54.818
CLASSROOM EDUCATION BECAUSE OF

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:56.352
UNIQUE ABILITIES AND SUCH.

00:55:56.419 --> 00:55:58.822
INSTALLATIONS RICO THE

00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.623
REQUIREMENTS MADE IT POSSIBLE

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.625
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE

00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:05.495
A QUALITY EDUCATION WITH STRICT

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:08.531
GUIDANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:10.333
PERSON LEARNING IS THE BEST

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.901
OPTION WHEN IT CAN BE DONE

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:14.270
SAFELY WHEN IT CAN INDEPENDENT

00:56:14.337 --> 00:56:16.740
STUDY NEEDS TO STRIKE A BALANCE

00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:17.807
BETWEEN THE DISTRICTS

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:19.342
REQUIREMENT TO EDUCATE THE

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.077

SENATOR LETTERED- I AGREE WITH

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:07.950
SOME OF THESE. PROPOSALS AT

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:11.154
LYNETTE HE NOW HAS MENTIONED- I

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.722
AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE FIFTEEN

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:14.557
DAYS BECAUSE- I AS I UNDERSTAND

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.025
IT FROM MY STUDIES ARE

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:17.593
CUMULATIVE DAYS SO. THE CITY

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.595
COULD HAVE- TAKEN FIVE IN THE

01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:21.964
FALL AND SUDDENLY TEN IN THIS IN

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.399
JANUARY MAYBE ANOTHER FIVE

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.768
LATER. IN THOSE ALL CREATES SOME

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.270
CONFUSION FOR STUFF SO THAT

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.906
NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED- I DO

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.541
THINK THAT IT WOULD BE BEST IF

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:33.910
WE COULD MAYBE. REMOVE THOSE

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.211
NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY FEEL A

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:36.646
LITTLE BIT ARBITRARY AND

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:38.881
DEPENDING ON HOW THE VIRUS MOVES

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.284
AND WHAT IT CAUSES. IN TERMS OF

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.152
ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE PERIODS

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.820
IT COULD THEY COULD POTENTIALLY

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:48.791
END UP. CREATING AGAIN. A

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:49.759
SITUATION WHERE THE STUDENTS

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:52.094
TRYING TO CATCH UP TO THE WORK

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.763
MAYBE ILL. AND THEN HAS TO COME

01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:55.064
BACK TO SCHOOL CONTINUE THEIR

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:57.867
LEARNING- SO THE PHYSICIAN OF

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:58.935
FLEXIBILITY I WOULD NEED TO

01:03:59.001 --> 01:03:59.902
UNDERSTAND FURTHER WHAT THAT

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:05.775
LOOKS LIKE- TO MAKE IT MORE.

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:07.376
REASONABLE IN TERMS. MOST ARE

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:11.714
ABOUT THAT I KNOW- SO HERE- SO I

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:12.915
JUST WANT SOME SOME ADDITIONAL

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:16.085
CLARIFICATION OF THAT IT IS VERY

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.687
DESTRUCTIVE TO STUDENTS WHEN

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.522
THEY'RE MOVING IN AND OUT OF

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:20.156
INDEPENDENCE TO THE SHORT TERM

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:21.257
INDEPENDENCE IN THE LONG TERM

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:23.192
THEY CHOOSE THAT AS WELL BACK

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.161
AND FORTH BETWEEN THE CLASSROOM

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:27.263
AND BEING AT HOME. SO I DO I

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.365
WOULD LIKE TO SEE US THINK UP A

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:30.199

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:34.136
ADDITIONAL- THANKS ABILITY AND

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:35.404

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:36.572
THE STATE FEELINGS SEEM A LITTLE

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.242
ARBITRARY AND WHEN IT COMES TO

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:42.111
CUMULATIVE- TIME. PERIODS IT'S

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:45.748
NOT ADDING UP THIS IS US THINGS

YOU YOU KNOW REALLY. I BELIEVE

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:22.518
WHAT OUR DISTRICT HAS TALKED

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:25.521
ABOUT. THE MOST IS SIGN THE

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:28.057
FLEXIBILITY AND THE DAILY

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:31.594
REQUIREMENT IN TRADITIONAL.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.297
INDEPENDENT STUDY. A STUDENT WAS

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:35.865
GIVEN A CALENDAR AND I

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:37.366
UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THAT

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.834
THIS REALLY DEPENDS ON THE AGE

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:41.170
OF THE STUDENT BUT IT AS STUDENT

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.905
WAS GIVEN A CALENDAR OF WORK A

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:45.975
LOG OF ASSIGNMENTS AND THEY WERE

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:47.510
REQUIRED TO MEET ONCE A WEEK.

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:48.911
WITH THEIR INDEPENDENT STUDY

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:51.147
TEACHER AND THEN THEY WENT OVER

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.449
THE PROGRESS. AND COMPLETION OF

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.751
ASSIGNMENTS THEY WERE REQUIRED

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.653
TO MAKE PROGRESS THAT'S THE KIND

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.955
OF FLEXIBILITY I THINK THAT WE

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:00.923
WOULD BE IMPRESSION ABOUT A

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.359
LITTLE. THE DAILY PARTICIPATION

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:06.762
IS OVERWHELMING MY DISTRICT HAS

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:09.365
ONE SPECIAL EDUCATION R. OR

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:11.267
INDEPENDENT STUDY TEACHERS FOR

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:14.103
GRADES. K. THROUGH THREE BUT

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:18.808
HAVE ANOTHER TEACHER. WHO'S

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.042
TAKING CARE OF GRADES FOUR

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:22.311
THROUGH EIGHT. AND THAT'S ALL

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.579
THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND THAT

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:24.747
DAILY INSTRUCTION PIECE IS

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.350
REALLY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN AND

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.385
TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THAT

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:30.653
EXHIBITION SO THAT THAT'S THE

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.622
BIGGEST THING I THINK THAT WE'RE

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:35.324
SEEM. I KNOW THAT WE WOULD

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:36.959
WELCOME MORE TIME FOR DAILY

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:38.194
CONTRACTS OR FOR INDEPENDENT

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:42.331
STUDY CONTRACTS TO BE SIGNED THE

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:43.499
TIME LIMITS ARE REALLY

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.568
RESTRICTING WE ARE SEEING MORE

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:47.069
OF OUR STUDENTS IN LONG TERM

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:49.305
INDEPENDENT STUDY RATHER THAN

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:51.674
COMING AND GOING. DO TO COPE AND

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:54.643
WE'VE OF COURSE SEEN EXTREME

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:55.745
ABSENCES BECAUSE OF CODE AND

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.480
WHATNOT. BUT TRYING TO GET

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:58.714
TOGETHER A PACKET FOR THAT

01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:01.350
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT ON THE FLY IS

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:04.587
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. SO IT YEAH

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:05.755
THAT THAT'S REALLY THE

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:07.456
FLEXIBILITY OF THE PROGRAM TO GO

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.225
BACK TO A SORT OF PREQUEL THE

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:11.527
DAYS WOULD BE FANTASTIC FOR OUR

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.662

ROBUST CONVERSATION THE WE DO.

YEAR. CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT

WELL THAT MAY COME INTO PLAY. AS

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:31.674
WE- CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.075

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.379
LET ME MAKE A COMMENT AND A

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:39.882
QUESTION THE COMMENT IS. AND I

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:40.783
THINK IT'S FOR OUR FIRST THREE

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.952
PANELISTS. OF THE PROCESS THAT

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:44.453
WE GO THROUGH HERE IS THE

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.722
GOVERNOR RELEASES THE BUDGET IN

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:50.459
JANUARY. AND WE GO THROUGH THE

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:52.595
TEN HEARINGS AND EVEN MORE THAT

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:54.930
WE HAVE. IN THE HOPES THAT WE

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:57.700
ARE OUT THE ISSUES AND THAT THE

01:08:57.766 --> 01:08:58.801
GOVERNOR AND THE FINANCE

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.402
DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:03.105
WILL RESPOND. IN THE MAY REVISE

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:05.608
AND- AND AS MUCH AS I WISH TO

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:06.742
HONOR WHAT CAME OUT TO THE

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.611
JANUARY TENTH BUDGET AND I'VE

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:14.183
BEEN A PART OF. A NUMBER. OF

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:14.783
THEM THROUGH THE YEARS MYSELF.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:15.885
THE JANUARY TENTH BUDGET. IF

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:17.353
DOES NOT BEAR RISK. TO WHAT IS A

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:19.188
- IN JUNE AND THE PROCESS IS

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:20.689
REALLY AIRING THESE ISSUES AND

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.825
HAVING THE- THE TO APARTMENT

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.728
STAFF LISTENED AS THEY ARE TODAY

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.763
IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN DECIDE IF

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.565
THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY WISH

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:30.799
TO INCORPORATE ALONG THE WAY.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:33.168
NOW MY OTHER QUESTION AND THIS

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:34.069
IS PROBABLY FOR THE FINANCE

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.539
DEPARTMENT. WHEN I WENT HOME

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.374
AFTER WE ADOPTED THE BUDGET I

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.343
GOT BOMBARDED PARTICULARLY IN MY

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:42.878
HOME TOWN OF SANTA CRUZ. BY

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:43.913
PEOPLE THAT HAD BEEN DOING

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.648
INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR THIRTY

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.450
YEARS. AND SUDDENLY IN THE

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:51.020
COURSE AND I THINK THAT. THE

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.855
COURT HAD ONE REFERRED TO THIS

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:55.257
OBLIQUELY IN HER COMMENTS. THEN

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.793
SUDDENLY. OF THE HAD ALL THESE

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.461
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.063
THEY CONSIDERED ONEROUS TO DO

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.965
WHAT THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DOING

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.500
FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IT WAS

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:07.469
REALLY PAINFUL FOR THEM AND-

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:09.738
IT'S NOT. AUTOMATE UNSURE WHAT

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.574
THE QUESTION IS EXCEPT IS THERE

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.908
A WAY TO TAKE SOMETHING LIKE

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:16.512
THAT INTO ACCOUNT. IT IN WHAT

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:18.480
YOU DO BECAUSE- THEY DIDN'T NEED

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:20.249
THE DISCIPLINE TO MAKE SURE THEY

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:22.251
WERE EDUCATING PEOPLE ONE MINUTE

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:23.786
SOMEBODY THAT WORKED FOR ME AT

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.287
ONE POINT CAME OUT OF THAT

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:26.422
THIRTY YEARS OF INDEPENDENT

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:27.856
STUDY I KNOW THAT THEY WERE

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:31.894
EDUCATED. THIS SO HOW DO- IS

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.228
THERE ANY FLEXIBILITY YOU COULD

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:35.664
GIVE IN THOSE SITUATIONS AS WE

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:38.634
LOOK AT GOING FORWARD WITH THIS

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:43.405
PROGRAM. I CAN ATTEMPT TO.

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:44.773
ANSWER THAT QUESTION AS I THINK

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.109
I UNDERSTOOD IT- I WOULD I WOULD

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.777
JUST SAY YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.913
THE SPRING AND JUNE LIKE YOU

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.848
SAID WHEN THE BUDGET WAS SIGNED-

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.650
YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT WAS A JOINT

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:56.185
EFFORT RIGHT BETWEEN. THE

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:57.820
FINANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.655
UNCERTAINLY CONSULTATION HEAVILY

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:04.259
WITH. CITY STAFF AND- AT THE

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.995
TIME RIGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:07.630
FORESIGHT TO KNOW THAT DELTA WAS

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:08.897
GONNA COME AROUND CERTAINLY NOT

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:11.233
NOW OMICRON. AND I THINK PART OF

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.636
THE CONCERN WAS YOU KNOW REALLY

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.137
RAMP BETWEEN BEEFING UP THE

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.705
EXISTING INDEPENDENCE WHAT STUDY

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:17.606
STRUCTURE BECAUSE WE DID

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:19.575
ANTICIPATE SO MANY MORE STUDENTS

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:21.110
AND SO MANY MORE ELEAZAR.

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:22.745
NEEDING TO USE THAN IN YEARS

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.480
PAST AND SO THAT WAS THE- I

01:11:24.546 --> 01:11:26.415
THINK THE MAIN THRUST BEHIND ON

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.317
SOME OF THOSE CHANGES- CERTAINLY

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:30.052
HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY SO WE

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.020
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE BEEN

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:32.855
DIFFICULTIES IN PRACTICE AND- WE

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:33.922
HOPE THAT OUR- GOALS AT THIS

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:36.058
TIME- WELL ADDRESS AND CLARIFY

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.327
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- BUT

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:39.762
THAT'S- YOU KNOW REALLY THE BEST

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:40.929
THAT I CAN SAY AT THE MOMENT

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:42.931
MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN LET ME

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:44.633
MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS IT I

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.302
APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:47.936
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.938
IT. I JUST HOPE YOU LISTEN TO

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.440
THIS CONVERSATION AND OTHER

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:53.108
CONVERSATIONS AS WE HEAD TOWARD

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:54.677
THE MAY REVISED TO DECIDE THAT

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.345
IF YOU NEED TO TWEAK IT OR DO

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:58.047
OTHER THINGS IN RESPONSE TO

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:00.149
CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED. YOU

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:02.117
WILL CONSIDER THAT SO THAT'S-

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:04.186
THAT'S ALL WE CAN HOPE FOR I

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:04.887
THINK JUST GIVEN WHERE WE ARE

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.622
RIGHT NOW. LET ME ASK MY

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:07.723
COLLEAGUES IF THERE ANY

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.391
QUESTIONS SENATOR MEANT DO YOU

CHANGES THAT YOU'RE MAKING.

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.548
WOULD THAT ALLOW ANY STUDENT FOR

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.083

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:21.830

SPEAK DUE TO COMBAT- EITHER ONE

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.308
THAT THE INTENT WOULD BE THAT.

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.010
THE SAME STRUCTURE BE ALLOWABLE

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.879
IN IN EITHER INSTANCE. THANK YOU

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:39.148
ADDED THIS IS A FOLLOW UP- I

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:40.249
MAYBE I MISSED THIS MATERIALS WE

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.917
HAD BUT YOU SEE INTENT THAT THIS

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:43.852
WOULD BE A TEMPORARY. MEASURE IN

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:45.854
RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE COVERT

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:46.955
ISSUES OR IS THE IDEA THAT THIS

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:51.960
WOULD BE A LONGER. RANGING.

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:52.895
CHANGE IN OUR POLICIES. AT THE-

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.530
IS IT IS AN ONGOING IT'S A

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:57.266
PERMANENT CHANGE OUR ENGINE AND-

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:58.600
AND I GUESS AND AS A FOLLOW UP

01:13:58.667 --> 01:13:59.868
TO THAT LIKE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE I

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:00.803
THINK ABOUT THIS IS WE'VE GOT

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:02.471
COVERT PROBLEMS AND THEN WE HAVE

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:04.740
LONGER TERM ISSUES AND- I THINK

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:05.941
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE-

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:08.110
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT IS

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:10.045
RELATED. TEMPORARILY TO COVET.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.513
AND WHAT WOULD MAYBE IN FIVE

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.781
YEARS IS GOING TO BE BEHIND US

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.850
AND THEN WHAT. IS SORT OF MORE

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:17.653
PERMANENT STRUCTURAL. HAVE YOU

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.521
YOU KNOW IS STUDIED THE IMPACT

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:20.355
THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ON

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:21.757
TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT STUDY

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:23.826
STUDENTS. ARE HOW THIS IS GOING

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.394
TO IMPACT THE DIFFERENT ELEAZAR

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.696
ACROSS THE STATE. SO I JUST WANT

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.665
TO UNDERSTAND SIR WHAT THIS

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:30.532
SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY AMBITIOUS

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.601
CHANGE. IF IT'S IF IT'S MEANT TO

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.536
BE PERMANENT. THEY COULD HAVE A

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.471
LOT OF COLLATERAL IMPACTS AND I

01:14:36.538 --> 01:14:37.906
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW I WANT

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.007
TO WEIGH IN ON THIS I REALLY

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:40.042
DON'T HAVE ANY OPINION ON IT

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:42.044
BUT- IT STRIKES ME THAT. YOU

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.846
KNOW SOMETIMES WE MAKE CHANGES

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:44.813
IN RESPONSE TO TEMPORARY

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.748
PROBLEMS. I AND WE CREATE BIGGER

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:50.886
PROBLEMS. WITH THOSE AND I WANNA

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:51.920
MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT DOING THAT

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:54.323
HERE. JERK I MEAN I THINK YOUR

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:54.957
YOUR COMMENT AREAS- WELL WELL

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.025
TAKEN UNDERSTOOD. I THINK FROM

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:59.561
OUR- POINT OF VIEW- THIS IS WHAT

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:01.463
WE FEEL IS THE BEST. CHANGE

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.265
MOVING FORWARD BUT- YOU KNOW

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.166
CERTAINLY LIKE I SAID IN MY

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:05.701
PREVIOUS COMMENT RIGHT HINDSIGHT

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:07.636
IS TWENTY TWENTY- WHICH I THINK

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.004
IS KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:09.905
OUT RIGHT TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.273
THOSE. THOSE THINGS- AND

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.408
CERTAINLY IF IT WERE TO COME IN

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:14.543
THE FUTURE- THAT THERE WERE TO

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.044
BE YOU KNOW CHANGES NEED TO

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:17.279
SCALE BACK THIS OR SOME OTHER

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.714
PIECE. I MEAN THAT IS ALWAYS A

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.183
POSSIBILITY- STATUTE CAN BE

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.452
ALTERED RIGHT- BUT AT THIS POINT

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:24.553
WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BUT

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.021
THIS APPROACH. SURE I GUESS I'D

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.656
FOLLOW UP AND JUST SAY YOU KNOW

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:28.924
STATUTES CAN BE ALTERED BUT IF

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:29.892
WE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM UP

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.059
FRONT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T. MAKE

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.561
THE CHANGE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:33.862
PRETTY GOOD GIVEN THE SHORT TIME

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:34.963
FRAMES WITH WHICH STUDENTS

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.632
LEARN- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:37.566
THERE'S PLENTY OF DATA IS A

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.735
FORMER TEACHER MYSELF THAT- IT'S

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.436
FAIRLY CLEAR THAT IN PERSON

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:44.239
INSTRUCTION IS. LIGHT YEARS.

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.374
MORE VALUABLE THAN SYNCHRONOUS

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.175
STUDY. AND ALSO GONNA STUDY MAY

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:49.912
BE APPROPRIATE FOR- THIS TIME A

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.380
COVERT I DO HAVE CONCERNS AROUND

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.215
THIS. I ALSO CONCERNS ABOUT

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:54.449
EQUITY ISSUES THAT MIGHT BE

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.184
RAISED AS WE EXPAND INDEPENDENT

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:58.487
STUDY. I WHAT'S THIS GOING TO DO

01:15:58.553 --> 01:15:59.521
FOR DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:00.355
ACROSS THE STATE I REALLY HAVE

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:01.857
NO SENSE OF THAT I THINK. IT'S

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:03.058
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU GUYS

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.160
STUDY THIS BEFORE WE- MOVE AHEAD

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.595
WITH IT WITH THE C. CHANGE THAT

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:08.463
COULD REALLY DRASTICALLY ALTER-

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.332
INSTRUCTION. I WANTED TO OPEN IT

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.601
UP TO ANY OF THE LOCAL-

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:14.002

OPINIONS ON THIS. I DO YOU HAVE

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:17.039
THOUGHTS ON WHAT THIS MIGHT DO

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:19.708
TO YOUR- ALLEY AS AND SCHOOLS.

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:21.276
IF WE WERE TO JUST OPEN UP A

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:22.511
PANDORA'S BOX HERE INDEPENDENT

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.012
STUDY TO EVERYBODY OF FORGETTING

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.914
COVERT FOR A MOMENT BUT- IN THE

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:27.916
LONG RUN. WELL THE STUDIO CO OF

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:51.640
THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD IT DO TO

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:52.741
OUR SCHOOL DOES AND WE WERE

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:54.343
INPUT A K. TWELVE INDEPENDENT

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.445
STUDY WHICH IS WHAT I'M- HEARING

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:58.981
DISCUSS. WELL IF WE WERE TO

01:16:59.047 --> 01:16:59.982
PERMANENTLY IS SO I'M JUST

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:02.117
SAYING FOR KOBE THE SEEM TOTALLY

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:03.752
APPROPRIATE. BUT BEYOND KOBE

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:05.554
LIKE THIS IMAGINE A FUTURE IF WE

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.388
CAN WORK OVER NO LONGER IS A

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:08.156
PROBLEM- WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:11.927
IMPACTS ON. YOUR SCHOOLS. IF WE

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:12.961
WERE TO CREATE A PERMANENT

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:13.895
CHANGE THAT ALLOWS A

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.731
SUBSTITUTION OF THINKERS STUDY

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:17.165
FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:18.900
INTENDED STATE PURPOSES. YEAH

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.969
JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'M

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.404
DEFINITELY SEEING THAT WHAT WAS

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.272
MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK IT WAS

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:24.906
CALLIMACHUS UNDER WHO MENTIONED

01:17:24.973 --> 01:17:27.042
THE IMPACTS. PARTICULARLY FOR

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.243
THE YOUNGER STUDENTS WE KNOW

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.811
THAT THAT HAS CREATED A HUGE

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:33.915
DISPARITY IN LEARNING- THE WAYS

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.384
THAT WE TEACH IN ELEMENTARY

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:36.918
GRADES BUT I HEARD.

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.353
SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN'S

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.788
COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT READING

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:43.058
AND LANGUAGE LEARNERS- I THINK

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.292
IT WOULD DEFINITELY CREATE THAT

01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:46.328
COSTS US SECOND SCHOOL SYSTEM

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:48.030
WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.898
WOULD CREATE A WHOLE NEW LEVEL

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:52.567
OF TEACHER SKILLS KNOWLEDGE AND

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:54.803
ATTRIBUTES. NEW CURRICULA-

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.005
DEVICES INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:57.939
INITIALLY IN SANTA BARBARA FOR

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:00.342
EXAMPLE HAVING THEM BOTH AND NOT

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:02.144
JUST AT THE SCHOOL BUT AT HOME

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.780
FOR CHILDREN- THE HELP THAT THEY

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.515
WOULD GET AT HOME IS IT WOULD

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:08.617
CREATE ANOTHER LEVEL OF. OF AN

01:18:08.683 --> 01:18:10.485
INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM IN MY

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:14.790
OPINION. JUST TOP OF MY HEAD

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:19.227
THINKING. OKAY THEN- DESIGN THAT

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:20.962
ARE HEADLINES YOU SO MUCH.

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:22.397
ANYBODY ELSE ANY QUESTIONS

01:18:22.464 --> 01:18:25.200
BEFORE WE MOVE ON. FROM I'M

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:26.501
GONNA MAKE ONE ADDITIONAL

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.703
CLOSING COMMENT AND I MADE THE

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:32.474
COMMENT ABOUT. AND BY THE WAY IT

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.944
DID TO THE- COMMENT ABOUT A

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:37.312
TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:40.182
HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY- WILL

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:42.184
HAVE HINDSIGHT FOR THREE OR FOUR

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.785
MONTHS OF THE ADDITIONALLY AT

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:46.521
THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISE AND I

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:47.089
HOPE THAT I THOUGHT THAT IF

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:48.957
THERE ARE. ADDITIONAL

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:51.526
REFINEMENTS THAT EMERGE AS A

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:52.127
RESULT OF THAT THEY WILL BE

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:54.029
CONSIDERED. AND ONE OF THE

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:56.331
THINGS THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.266
MATCH TO COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:01.036
. IS THAT WE DISCUSS THIS IN

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:03.705
OPEN SESSION AND- WITH MANY

01:19:03.772 --> 01:19:05.674
STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT SCHOOL

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.175
BOARDS ASSOCIATION WAS

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.577
REFLECTING OUT TO ITS

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:11.113
CONSTITUENCY. OF THE SCHOOL

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:13.281
ADMINISTRATOR FOR REFLECTING OUT

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:16.251
CSEA AND WE HAVE A

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:18.086
REPRESENTATIVE HERE TODAY WAS

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:21.857
REFLECTING OUT C. F. T. C. T. A.

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:24.893
N. IT WAS EXASPERATING. TO HEAR

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.195
OCCASIONALLY AFTER IT WAS ALL

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:28.296
DONE THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:30.699
SOMETHING WHEN. THERE WAS A

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.300
CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:34.302
PROCESS TO REFLECT THEIR VIEWS

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.238
BEFORE THE DECISION WAS MADE.

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:38.140
AND SO I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:40.242
ANYBODY THAT'S LISTENING. ARM TO

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:41.877
DO THAT THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:44.279
TIME. TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:47.315
THIS IS NOW BETWEEN NOW AND MAY

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:48.817
AND MAKE SURE. THAT IF PEOPLE

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.719
HAVE ISSUES THEY ARE REFLECTED

BUDGETS ARE THOSE DISTRICTS

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.006
COULD I TAKE SCHOOL BOARD ACTION

01:27:58.072 --> 01:27:59.474
TO DESIGNATE THOSE WITH SERVICE

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.409

ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THIS BUDGET

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:14.288
ARE REASONABLE. IN TWENTY ONE

01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:15.823

LITTLE OVER NINE BILLION BELOW

ARE NOVEMBER ESTIMATES. THAT'S

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:21.829
STILL WELL WITHIN THE RANGE OF

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:23.064
WHAT'S PLAUSIBLE ALTHOUGH THERE

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.866
IS MAYBE A MORE LIKELY THAT THE

MAJORITY OF THAT DIFFERENCE IS

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:37.845
REALLY RELATED TO SOME OF THE

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:40.214
SPECIFIC TAX PROPOSALS IN THIS

IN THAT YEAR ARE IS REALLY WE'RE

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:49.323
REALLY CLOSE. WHAT THE B. X.

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:50.992

EACH DOLLAR OF HIGHER LOWER

01:28:57.632 --> 01:28:58.666

FORMULA IN THE STATE

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:01.903

AND IN THE YEAR THAT WAS A AND-

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.618
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:19.253
POINT OUT THAT. EVEN A VERY

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.456
LARGE ATTENDANCE DECLINE- IN

NEXT PANEL. THE BUDGET ALSO CAN

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:20.314
TWO POINT THREE BILLION FOR

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:21.916
INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE BIGGEST

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:23.284
COMPONENT OF THAT WITHIN THE

COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THEN

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.594
FINALLY THERE'S ABOUT SIX

BILLION- IN OTHER PROPOSALS

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:38.499
THAT. I DON'T REALLY FALL INTO

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:40.401
ANY OF THOSE OTHER CATEGORIES.

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.170

HEARINGS I WANT SPEND TOO MUCH

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:57.885
TIME. FOCUSING ON THOSE BY

01:30:57.952 --> 01:30:59.754
TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT I WOULD

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:00.855
POINT OUT THAT THE STATE HAS

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:02.056
REACHED A FAIRLY IMPORTANT

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.324
FISCAL MILESTONE IN WHICH IT

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.526
COULD. MOST LIKELY WHETHER A

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:13.100
MILD RECESSION WITHOUT. AND THAT

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:14.135
KIND OF BUDGET RESILIENCE REALLY

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.204
REFLECTS TWO FACTORS THE FIRST

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.271
IS THE BALANCE OF THE

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:19.140
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE

01:31:19.207 --> 01:31:20.842
NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION NEARLY

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:23.177
10% OF THE GUARANTEE- THE OTHER

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:24.812
IS THAT THE BUDGET DOES NOT

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:25.947
COMMIT ALL OF THE ON GOING

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:27.682
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING

01:31:27.748 --> 01:31:29.183
TO ONGOING. PROPOSITION NINETY

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.152
PROGRAMS SO THAT CREATES A

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.520
CHRISTIAN BUT LET'S THE STATE

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:34.689
ADDRESS PRODUCTIONS MINIMUM

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.824
GUARANTEE MORE EASILY. AND TO

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:38.159
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:39.827
OF RESILIENCE WE'RE TALKING

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:41.262
ABOUT. IF THE STATE HI

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:42.997
PATHETICALLY WORD TO EXPERIENCE

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:44.699
A YEAR OVER YEAR GENERAL FUND

AT THAT LEVEL IN TWENTY FOUR

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:52.974
TWENTY FIVE AND THEN RECOVER IN

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.275
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX- THE

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.177
STATE OULD. FIND AT THE

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:59.447
GUARANTEE. AND WOULD NOT NEED TO

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:02.817
MAKE REDUCTIONS. TO PROGRAMS.

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:03.851
BECAUSE THEY CAN USE THEIR

PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:06.988

THIS- UNLIKE PREVIOUS YEARS THE

STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT IS A

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:33.781
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THIS

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:37.091
SOME SORT OF SETTLE UP THERE

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:38.926

THE GUARANTEE THAT'S NOT SPENT

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:53.093
FOR SOMETHING IN THEIR NEW

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.762
PROPOSAL OR A REQUIRED

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:55.863
ALLOCATION LIKE THE PROPOSITION

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:58.065
AND YOU DESERVE DEPOSIT. SO THE

01:38:58.132 --> 01:39:02.036
TOTAL NUMBER OF NEW PROGRAMS A

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:04.104
SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION-

01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:08.609
THE GOVERNOR- PROPOSES- THE

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:09.877
SPLIT IS TEN POINT SIX BILLION

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:12.313
FOR ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS AND

01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:12.846
SEVENTEEN SEVEN POINT TWO

01:39:12.913 --> 01:39:15.516
BILLION FR ONE TIME BY ABOUT

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.885
ONE BILLION OF THE ONE TIME

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:20.621
PROPOSALS COULD BE CONVERTED TO

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:22.122
ONGOING AT THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:25.359
TO DO THAT- AS AARON SAID THERE

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.328
IS- REASONS NOT TO DO THAT.

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.729
BECAUSE THAT WOULD REDUCE YOUR

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:31.298
BUDGET QUESTION BUT ESSENTIALLY

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:32.633
I THINK THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.502
IS THAT THERE IS SIX POINT TWO

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:37.404
BILLION OR SO THAT HAS TO BE

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:38.672
SPENT THAT CAN ONLY BE CENTER ON

01:39:38.739 --> 01:39:40.774
GO FOR ONE TIME AND IT'S AN

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:42.676
ADDITIONAL BILLION IN ONGOING

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:45.679
MONEY THAT SPENT ON ONE TIME.

01:39:45.746 --> 01:39:48.482
PURPOSES AND THEN THE REST. TEN

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:50.384
POINT SIX BILLION IS ALL ONGOING

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:51.919
MONEY SPENT ON ONGOING

01:39:51.985 --> 01:39:57.624
ACTIVITIES. I THINK UP DISCUSS

01:39:57.691 --> 01:40:01.061
ON OFF I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL-

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:03.030
THE END YOU KNOW YOU OPEN THE

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:04.732
DOOR AND ONE OTHER THING AND WE

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:05.899
HAVE TO MOVE ON SO I DON'T WANT

01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:07.668
TO GET LOST IN THE WEEDS AND YOU

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:10.170
OPEN THE DOOR SAY NEW FOR FUND

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:12.673
THE NEW PROGRAMS BUT IT'S THAT

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.108
THAT OPENS THE DOOR ABOUT

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:15.609
WHETHER THERE'S THINGS WERE NOT

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:17.211
DOING OR TAKING MONEY THAT WE'RE

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:18.579
NOT DOING AND MOVING IT TO NEW

01:40:18.645 --> 01:40:20.314
PROGRAMS AND SO THAT'S NOT THE

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:22.082
TOTAL AMOUNT NECESSARILY THAT'S

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:24.585
AVAILABLE YEAR TO YEAR. IN A

01:40:24.651 --> 01:40:26.320
DIFFERENCE AND SO I'M GONNA

01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:28.756
ENDED HERE OR ELSE WE WILL SPEND

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:32.226
FOR A WHILE BUT I THINK AS WE

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:34.161
HEAD TOWARD. MAY WE JUST WANNA

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.729
HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:38.532
YEAR TO YEAR. WHAT THE CHANGES

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:40.534
IN YEAR TO YEAR WHAT'S AVAILABLE

01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:41.869
AND OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:43.003
HAVE THE DEBATE ON ALL THE

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:46.073
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. ARE BUT I

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.875
THINK HAVING THE GLOBAL SENSE OF

DECLINES IN THE CURRENT YEAR-

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:10.056
ONE OPTION COULD BE TO ALLOW

02:02:10.122 --> 02:02:11.057
CHARTER SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:12.625

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:20.579
MILLION THE L. C. A FAST COSTS

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:22.948
WERE CALCULATED ASSUMING SEVEN

02:05:23.015 --> 02:05:24.016
HUNDRED MILLION MORE AN

02:05:24.083 --> 02:05:25.050
OFFSETTING PROPERTY TAXES ACROSS

02:05:25.117 --> 02:05:28.020
THE THREE YEARS SO IF ONE WERE

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:30.089
TO ASSUME ALL OTHER THINGS HELD

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:32.157
CONSTANT WE NOW IN THE MAYOR

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:33.525
VISION WHICH WE KNOW WILL NOT BE

02:05:33.592 --> 02:05:36.061
THE CASE BUT WERE THAT TO BE SO

02:05:36.128 --> 02:05:37.930
THEN TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIN WE

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:41.267
WOULD HAVE TO- REDUCE SPENDING

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:43.936
IN OTHER AREAS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF

02:05:44.003 --> 02:05:46.972
LCF ASKED. TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:49.909
COST THAT WAS NOT APPROPRIATELY-

02:05:49.975 --> 02:05:52.211
ANTICIPATED IN THOSE THREE YEARS

02:05:52.278 --> 02:05:54.914
AND SO IF ALL THINGS DID REMAIN

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:57.516
CONSTANT AND I KNOW THEY WON'T

02:05:57.583 --> 02:05:59.184
BUT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:00.552
UNDERSTAND IF ALL THINGS DID

02:06:00.619 --> 02:06:02.955
REMAIN CONSTANT THERE'D HAVE TO

02:06:03.022 --> 02:06:04.757
BE A SCALE BACK OVER THREE YEARS

02:06:04.823 --> 02:06:06.425
OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:08.360
SINCE OF WHAT THE PROGRAMMING

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:10.296
WAS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S

02:06:10.362 --> 02:06:12.531
CORRECT CUMULATIVELY SEVEN

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:18.037
HUNDRED MILLION ONLY. THREE

02:06:18.103 --> 02:06:19.338
HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE ONGOING

02:06:19.405 --> 02:06:20.105
POT IN TWENTY TWELVE THIRTY JUST

02:06:20.172 --> 02:06:21.140
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT

02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:22.708
JUST BY. WITH THE THING THAT

02:06:22.775 --> 02:06:24.109
WOULD AFFECT SO I WAS TRYING AND

02:06:24.176 --> 02:06:24.977
WHAT IT WATER. THAT'S VERY

02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:27.713
HELPFUL NOW TO THE- DISCUSSION

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:30.416
OF THE POWER. OF THE AVERAGE

02:06:30.482 --> 02:06:32.785
DAILY ATTENDANCE SAID AND THE

02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:35.955
PROPOSAL HERE- AND I DON'T KNOW

02:06:36.021 --> 02:06:41.627
MAYBE FINANCE WITH WITH- WITH

02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:43.896
THE L. A. COMMENTING MISTER FINE

02:06:43.963 --> 02:06:46.498
MENTIONED THAT THERE'S ROUGHLY

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:47.299
THREE HUNDRED DISTRICTS THAT ARE

02:06:47.366 --> 02:06:49.501
GROWING AND IF IT TURNS OUT

02:06:49.568 --> 02:06:52.104
THEY'RE GROWING AT A LEVEL. THAT

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:55.674
THEY'RE ABOVE BAR THE ROLLING

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:56.608
THREE YEAR AVERAGE UNDER

02:06:56.675 --> 02:06:59.478
PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY

02:06:59.545 --> 02:07:01.213
THAT THEY ALL WOULD CHOOSE TO

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:05.284
HIRE YEAR IT WILL FINANCE IS

02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:08.487
THAT CORRECT. I WOULD IT IT'S

02:07:08.554 --> 02:07:10.222
NOT SO MUCH A MATTER OF CHOICE

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.991
AS- AND THE PART OF IT TO

02:07:12.057 --> 02:07:14.193
CONFIRM BUT WHEN FUNDED EDA IS

02:07:14.259 --> 02:07:15.728
CALCULATED AND DETERMINED IT'S

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:17.363
JUST WHICHEVER ONE IS GREATER

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:18.731
PURSUANT TO STATUTE THAT'S WHAT

02:07:18.797 --> 02:07:20.165
THEY WOULD RECEIVE SO IT'S JUST

02:07:20.232 --> 02:07:21.633
TERM AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:23.669
ACTION OF THE DISTRICT THAT'S

02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:27.239
CORRECT AND THUS FAR WHEN WE HAD

02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:29.274
THE TWO YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE

02:07:29.341 --> 02:07:32.144
LAST YEAR. IT DID NOT TAKE INTO

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:35.581
ACCOUNT THE GREATER OF THE TWO

02:07:35.647 --> 02:07:38.517
DID. NO CURRENT LAW DOES SO IT'S

02:07:38.584 --> 02:07:40.486
HISTORICALLY BEEN THE GREATER OF

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:42.554
THE CURRENT OR PRIOR YEAR

02:07:42.621 --> 02:07:46.091
REPORTED ADA. OKAY THEN I HAVE A

02:07:46.158 --> 02:07:47.793
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S VERY

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.995
CONFUSED AND I WILL HAVE TO ON

02:07:50.062 --> 02:07:54.033
CONFUSED- AND IT. IT'S THIS

02:07:54.099 --> 02:07:56.268
ANOMALOUS SITUATION WHERE. THE

02:07:56.335 --> 02:07:57.836
FIRE THAT RAGED THROUGH THE

02:07:57.903 --> 02:08:02.941
MOUNTAINS BURNED DOWN 27% OF THE

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:04.510
HOMES IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:07.312
BANNER HAD A CORRESPONDING LOSS.

02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:10.616
IN ADA AND IT MANAGED TO SHOW UP

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:12.051
IN AN ADJOINING DISTRICT IT

02:08:12.117 --> 02:08:14.553
DIDN'T BURN AND THEY WERE SMALL

02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:16.822
IT WAS- A DISPROPORTIONATE

02:08:16.889 --> 02:08:18.057
PERCENTAGE AND THEY FELT LIKE

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:19.558
THEY WERE NOT GETTING REIMBURSED

02:08:19.625 --> 02:08:21.827
FOR THEIR HIGHER ADA AND SO I

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:23.062
THINK WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:24.129
THEY COULD HAVE CLAIMED THE

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:26.665
HIGHER ADA IN THE SECOND YEAR.

02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:29.835
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE OF

02:08:29.902 --> 02:08:31.970
ALLOCATION. OR YOU HAVE BEEN

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:33.205
TELLING ME THAT SOMEBODY WOULD

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:35.707
PICK THAT FOR THEM UP VOTE RIGHT

02:08:35.774 --> 02:08:38.143
AND THEM HAVING. IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:39.845
THAT MAY BE A BIT OF A UNIQUE

02:08:39.912 --> 02:08:42.548
CASE- IF YOU'RE FREE MORE THAN

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:44.516
HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH THEM TO THE

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:46.485
EXTENT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A

02:08:46.552 --> 02:08:49.154
SITUATION I THINK. WE MAY HAVE

02:08:49.221 --> 02:08:50.222
MET WITH SOME FOLKS ABOUT

02:08:50.289 --> 02:08:52.191
ALREADY IN THE HOME ARE YOU HAVE

02:08:52.257 --> 02:08:54.226
WITH THE DISTRICT THAT BURNS I

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:56.028
DON'T KNOW THE CHIU OF MET WITH

02:08:56.095 --> 02:08:58.130
THE DISTRICT THAT THAT HAD THE

02:08:58.197 --> 02:09:02.167
HIGHER. AMOUNT OF ENROLLMENT AND

02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:03.969
I KNOW BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED

02:09:04.036 --> 02:09:07.439
WITH PARADISE THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:09:07.506 --> 02:09:09.241
THINGS THAT ARE DONE IN PLACES

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:10.676
THAT HAVE SUCH A MONUMENTAL

02:09:10.742 --> 02:09:12.411
IMPACT SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER

02:09:12.478 --> 02:09:14.246
TIME SO THAT THEY DON'T JUST

02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:16.782
SORT THAT LOSS BUT ON I DON'T

02:09:16.849 --> 02:09:18.851
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS.

02:09:18.917 --> 02:09:21.186
AN IMAGINE JUST HAVING BEEN

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:23.021
INVOLVED IN THE RESPONSE TO THAT

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:25.057
FIRED THE SCHOOL. ATTENDANCE

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:26.892
PROBABLY WENT UP DRAMATICALLY IN

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:28.060
CHICO WHAT WENT DOWN

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:30.362
DRAMATICALLY IN PARADISE I HAVE

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:31.096
NO IDEA IF THERE WAS AN

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:33.198
ADJUSTMENT MADE TO CHICO FOR THE

02:09:33.265 --> 02:09:35.868
HIGHER. EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN ON

02:09:35.934 --> 02:09:38.003
A MUCH SMALLER SCALE THIS IS THE

02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:41.707
SAME CIRCUMSTANCE. AND SO. I AM

02:09:41.773 --> 02:09:44.376
HAPPY TO HAVE THE DISTRICT HAD

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:46.345
TO GAIN AN ORAL MUCH ENGAGED

02:09:46.411 --> 02:09:48.714
WITH YOU IF THEY HAVEN'T ARE BUT

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:51.083
THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING IF. THE

02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:52.885
IF IN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEAR

02:09:52.951 --> 02:09:59.825
ROLLING UNDER. THE EXISTING TWO

02:09:59.892 --> 02:10:01.160
YEAR ROLLING ONE. IF HIRE YEAR

02:10:01.226 --> 02:10:02.861
COULD BE. THAT'S ALL I WAS OF

02:10:02.928 --> 02:10:04.897
GET AT AND IT'S LIKE THE WAS YES

02:10:04.963 --> 02:10:07.166
WHICH I DO KNOW. WHAT I THOUGHT

02:10:07.232 --> 02:10:08.734
. IT WAS AT NOW THEN LET ME A

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:13.138
THE ON NOT QUESTION. THIS THE-

02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:14.573
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE APPLAUDING

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:16.408
THIS IS A THEY FEEL LIKE IT IT

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:18.310
GIVES THEM A HOLD HARMLESS IN

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:20.579
SOME WAYS. BUT DOESN'T IT JUST

02:10:20.646 --> 02:10:22.281
CREATE A CLIFF THAT WERE MOVING

02:10:22.347 --> 02:10:24.249
THE CLIFF ONE YEAR OUT AND IF

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:26.185
THERE'S NO CHANGES AT ALL A YEAR

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:27.586
FROM JUNE THIRTIETH THERE'S

02:10:27.653 --> 02:10:30.622
GOING TO BE A DRAMATIC IMPACT TO

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:34.026
A LOT OF DISTRICTS. I DON'T KNOW

02:10:34.092 --> 02:10:37.162
I WOULDN'T. THINK SO- I THINK AS

02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:39.831
AS- MISTER FINE DETAIL IN HIS

02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:42.000
PRESENTATION REALLY WHAT IT

02:10:42.067 --> 02:10:45.137
DOES. IS IT KIND OF AVOIDS THE

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:47.005
SITUATION OF THERE BEING A CLIFF

02:10:47.072 --> 02:10:47.940
ALTOGETHER I WOULD ARGUE

02:10:48.006 --> 02:10:49.942
BECAUSE- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:51.076
DISTRICT IS DECLINING AND

02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:52.344
NEEDING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:54.112
THAT VARIABLE THAT INCLUDES THE

02:10:54.179 --> 02:10:55.981
THREE YEAR. THE THREE PRIOR YEAR

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:58.984
AVERAGE- THAT IS IN AFFECTS

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:00.852
MOVING OUT WHAT OTHERWISE MAY

02:11:00.919 --> 02:11:02.955
HAVE BEEN A FISCAL CLIFF SO

02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:06.491
AWESOME ALL UP. TO ME REFINE THE

02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:07.893
QUESTION BECAUSE MAYBE ON NOT

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:10.162
BEING CLEAR. I GUESS WHAT IT

02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:12.164
DOES FOR THE THREE YEARS AND IT

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:14.399
DOES REFINE OR OR REMOVE THE

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:17.269
FISCAL CLIFF. IF WE WENT BACK TO

02:11:17.336 --> 02:11:19.171
A. D. A. WITH NO ADJUSTMENT OR

02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:20.739
NO ROLLING AVERAGE ON JUNE

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:21.907
THIRTIETH A YEAR FROM NOW

02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:23.475
PROVIDING WE ADOPTED THE

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:25.577
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I AM

02:11:25.644 --> 02:11:27.946
ASSUMING THAT THERE WOULD BE. A

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:30.549
WHOLE SERIES OF DISTRICTS THAT

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:32.184
WOULD GO DOWN IMMEDIATELY IN

02:11:32.251 --> 02:11:34.219
THEIR ADA AT THE END OF THOSE

02:11:34.286 --> 02:11:37.389
THREE YEARS. AND ONE ARM ASKING.

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:39.524
THAT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF THE

02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:41.393
PRESUMPTION IS. OVER THE NEXT

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.395
YEAR AND A HALF CONFIDENCE AND

02:11:43.462 --> 02:11:45.264
THAT SOMEHOW MAGICALLY EVERYBODY

02:11:45.330 --> 02:11:48.000
GOES BACK TO TWO CANADIENNE IS

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:49.468
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT

02:11:49.534 --> 02:11:54.539
HAPPENED. AT THE BEGINNING OF

02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:55.907
THE PANDEMIC. BUT IT'S TO ME.

02:11:55.974 --> 02:11:57.042
THE COULD BE WRONG BUT WON'T

02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:58.377
HAPPEN THERE WILL BE LOWERED

02:11:58.443 --> 02:11:59.745
REMEDY A LOT OF THE SCHOOL

02:11:59.811 --> 02:12:02.414
DISTRICTS AFTER THE END OF A

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:04.383
THREE YEAR ROLLING THING. THAT'S

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:08.553
WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS CLIFF.

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:11.356
EIGHT AND I AM JUST WONDERING IF

02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:13.458
. OUR EVERYBODY JUST CELEBRATING

02:12:13.525 --> 02:12:15.560
GETTING SAVED NEXT YEAR AND NOT

02:12:15.627 --> 02:12:17.329
LOOKING AT WHAT THE LONGER TERM

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:19.931
IMPACT MIGHT BE IF THE THREE

02:12:19.998 --> 02:12:22.567
YEAR ROLLING FANS AFTER THREE

02:12:22.634 --> 02:12:24.803
YEARS THAT'S WHAT I'M DRIVING AT

02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:27.673
. OKAY YEAH RIGHT RIGHT SO IT

02:12:27.739 --> 02:12:29.441
SOUNDS I THINK LIKE MAYBE YOUR

02:12:29.508 --> 02:12:31.977
YOUR ALSO COMMENTING JUST ON THE

02:12:32.044 --> 02:12:33.779
LONGER TERM TREND WE ANTICIPATE

02:12:33.845 --> 02:12:35.981
OF ENROLLMENT EVEN. EVEN WITH

02:12:36.048 --> 02:12:37.582
OUR CURRENT ONE NOW HAVE YOU SEE

02:12:37.649 --> 02:12:39.084
I DO I THINK THERE IS A LONGER

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.852
TERM TREND BUT COVETOUS

02:12:40.919 --> 02:12:44.156
XCELERATED IN IN THE SHORT TERM.

02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:47.426
AND WE ARE MAKING A DECISION NOW

02:12:47.492 --> 02:12:49.394
TO DO THE ROLLING THING IF WE

02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:50.962
AGREE BY THE TIME OF THE MAY

02:12:51.029 --> 02:12:52.497
REVISE WERE AGREEING TO DO THE

02:12:52.564 --> 02:12:54.533
THIRD YEAR ROLLING. MOST OF THE

02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:56.335
SCHOOLS ARE SIX REALLY WANT THAT

02:12:56.401 --> 02:12:58.403
BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THEM AND

02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:59.871
THEN THEY'LL COME BACK THE NEXT

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:02.774
YEAR AND SAY HELP US BECAUSE OF

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:04.476
AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:06.044
WILL BE DROPPING IF THE ROLLING

02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:09.114
AVERAGE HAPPENS. I'M JUST ASKING

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:10.415
IF WE SHOULD HAVE A VERSION OF

02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:12.617
THAT CONVERSATION NOW THAT THAT

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:14.419
THAT IS THE ISSUE BECAUSE WE ARE

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:16.188
MAKING THE DECISION FOR THE

02:13:16.254 --> 02:13:18.023
THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE IN

02:13:18.090 --> 02:13:20.759
THIS BUDGET PROCESS. SO A. N. A

02:13:20.826 --> 02:13:23.128
DON'T GET ME WRONG I DON'T HAVE

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:26.465
A SOLUTION- BUT I THINK A DENTAL

02:13:26.531 --> 02:13:28.467
FONG THE PROBLEM WOULD LEAD TO A

02:13:28.533 --> 02:13:30.268
DISCUSSION THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A

02:13:30.335 --> 02:13:32.170
SOLUTION IF WE THINK THERE'S

02:13:32.237 --> 02:13:34.239
SOMEWHERE THERE AND IT IS REALLY

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:36.775
WORTHY. OF HAVING A DISCUSSION

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:38.477
ABOUT THE LONG TERM ISSUE AT

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:40.512
SOME POINT IN THIS BUDGET

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:44.483
PROCESS SO IN. AN ARM I DO SEE

02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:46.284
PEOPLE COMING ON FROM THE L. A.

02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:48.487
O.'S OFFICE AND HEAD AND ERIN

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:50.489
WE'VE HAD YOU ON THE SPOT IT

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:51.790
DOES THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY

02:13:51.857 --> 02:14:03.568
COMMENT TODAY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. ABOUT THE SITUATION IS- EDGAR. BOTH OF THE THREE ARE THE

02:14:03.635 --> 02:14:06.938
CORRECT I'LL JUST THINKING THAT

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:07.906
UNITED IS DEFINITELY A PURPLE

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:13.578
THAT IS- ALL THE CHANGES IF NOT

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:15.647
INTENDED TO FOR THIRTY THREE

02:14:15.714 --> 02:14:18.784
MCCARTY. THERE IS A CLIP THERE'S

02:14:18.850 --> 02:14:20.585
A STATE DECLINE OVER THE PAST IS

02:14:20.652 --> 02:14:22.154
THE RESULT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN

02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:25.157
IN ATTENDANCE IF CAL SCHOOLS. WE

02:14:25.223 --> 02:14:26.691
THINK THAT FOR LOW WE THINK OF

02:14:26.758 --> 02:14:27.893
STRENGTH OF A PROPOSAL IS THAT

02:14:27.959 --> 02:14:29.528
WE DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:14:29.594 --> 02:14:30.996
. BACK UP WHERE DOES THE TO BE

02:14:31.062 --> 02:14:33.165
ALIGNED WITH OUR PROGRAMS AND

02:14:33.231 --> 02:14:34.433
THE NUMBERS TO THAT ARE IN

02:14:34.499 --> 02:14:37.235
SCHOOL. THE LONG TERM COME A OF

02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:38.837
THEIR OF THEIR NUMBER WAYS TO

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:41.406
ADDRESS THAT ONE THING IS ASK

02:14:41.473 --> 02:14:43.575
TENANTS MICHAEL CAN. OF

02:14:43.642 --> 02:14:45.076
PRESCHOOLERS BECAUSE THE MINIMUM

02:14:45.143 --> 02:14:47.612
IS GROWING OUR IT'S GOING BASED

02:14:47.679 --> 02:14:49.981
ON J. FUND REVENUES FORTY ZERO

02:14:50.048 --> 02:14:52.017
FUND REVENUES YOU THINK KEY

02:14:52.083 --> 02:14:53.718
SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

02:14:53.785 --> 02:14:56.455
. THAT HAVING THE WORST WERE THE

02:14:56.521 --> 02:14:58.056
MINIMUM CARE GROW MEANS THE

02:14:58.123 --> 02:14:59.391
THERE IS A DISK. FUNDING TO YOU

02:14:59.458 --> 02:15:01.626
COULD PROVIDE INCREASE OFFICE

02:15:01.693 --> 02:15:04.396
FOR A FAMILY OF BE FACED WITH

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:07.165
FIRST OVERSTAFFED WITH THE FIRST

02:15:07.232 --> 02:15:08.834
STONE THE FIFTH TRYING TO

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.702
ATTRACT ISSUES IT DOESN'T

02:15:10.769 --> 02:15:12.504
ADDRESS COMPLETE FOR SOME. ARE

02:15:12.571 --> 02:15:16.208
HIRING SIGNIFICANT DECLINE- BUT

02:15:16.274 --> 02:15:17.342
WE DO THINK KNOW OVER THE LONG

02:15:17.409 --> 02:15:19.644
RUN TO TODAY BUT IT DOES MAKE

02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:22.380
SOME THIRTY ALIGNED WITH THE IN

02:15:22.447 --> 02:15:25.450
TO WHEN. THERE'S A NEW DROPS.

02:15:25.517 --> 02:15:28.053
TWENTY DIFFERENT TACK AFTER THEM

02:15:28.119 --> 02:15:28.820
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT'S

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:31.356
PART OF WHY WE ARE LIKE PRISON

02:15:31.423 --> 02:15:34.059
PROPOSAL THAT IT IT SOUNDS. KIND

02:15:34.125 --> 02:15:35.927
OF SOFTEN THE IBM BUT IT DOESN'T

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:37.529
THAT OVER LONG RUN DISTRICTS TO

02:15:37.596 --> 02:15:40.332
OPT IT MAKE ONLINE LET ME TO

02:15:40.398 --> 02:15:42.868
ARMS THE OTHER TWO FROM THANK

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:46.538
YOU AND- IF MR FOR HIS BODY

02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:49.307
LANGUAGE. IN LIEU OF TEST SO A

02:15:49.374 --> 02:15:51.543
CO HE'S BEEN OR IS HEAD AT. KIND

02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:53.678
OF THUMBS UP FOR DOWN OF ROMAN

02:15:53.745 --> 02:15:55.647
OF VERSION OF. RESPONDING TO

02:15:55.714 --> 02:15:57.816
PEOPLE COMMENTS FROM THEN LET ME

02:15:57.883 --> 02:16:00.452
ASK IT AND ON UPON BECAUSE I

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:01.653
KNOW WE THE WHIMS AMOUNT OF-

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.421
TIME FOR THIS I'M TRY TO GET

02:16:03.488 --> 02:16:24.209
THESE AND THE ALEJO.

02:16:27.913 --> 02:16:28.079
THE SIMPLE

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:29.347
FACT THAT JUST LET YOU KNOW WHAT

02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:30.482
THE GUARANTEE WHAT WE'RE GOING

02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:32.183
TO SEE IF I. NUMBERS WOULD BE IF

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:34.185
YOU ADDED IF YOU USE THE MOMENT

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:37.122
BETTER. I THINK- AND IN GENERAL

02:16:37.188 --> 02:16:39.357
DIRECTED ATTENDANCE AND TO BE A

02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:40.592
LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN. THE

02:16:40.659 --> 02:16:41.526
GENERAL MATHS SO YOU WOULD

02:16:41.593 --> 02:16:42.894
EXPECT THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE

02:16:42.961 --> 02:16:45.730
BIT HIGHER. COSTS WOULD BE

02:16:45.797 --> 02:16:47.732
HIGHER THAN MEANS AND IF YOU IF

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:50.368
WANT HIGHER AND IT WAS BECAUSE

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:53.872
THE- ADA'S REFERRED TO AS PART

02:16:53.939 --> 02:16:56.074
OF THE GUARANTEE IN OUR- IN OUR-

02:16:56.141 --> 02:17:02.480
AGENDA. IF. IT WEREN'T HIGHER.

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:03.648
IT WILL BE ASSESSED BASED ON THE

02:17:03.715 --> 02:17:05.317
NEWS. WITHIN THE- OF THAT'S

02:17:05.383 --> 02:17:08.019
AVAILABLE WITH THE GARY A SECOND

02:17:08.086 --> 02:17:09.454
. THAT'S RIGHT TO JUST THE IT

02:17:09.521 --> 02:17:11.556
DOESN'T CHANGE THE GIVE.

02:17:11.623 --> 02:17:13.325
MATURITY WITH THE PEOPLE THE

02:17:13.391 --> 02:17:15.093
TIME THAT WOULD JUST BE A MATTER

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.895
OF WITHIN THAT THE OF MONEY TO

02:17:16.962 --> 02:17:18.163
FIGHT TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON

02:17:18.229 --> 02:17:21.166
HEALTH. PROXY YOU SPEAK. TO A

02:17:21.232 --> 02:17:24.002
YOUR HIGHER WON'T. THE THING

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:26.071
THAT I AND THAT PP I SEED A BOY

02:17:26.137 --> 02:17:28.106
. AND IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:29.608
AND I MEANT THE THAT THE BIGGEST

02:17:29.674 --> 02:17:30.709
COLDEST HONEST COULD A BILL

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:33.545
DOLLAR. AND THAT ALL DISTRICTS

02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:35.847
PROBABLY SOME THAT ARE MORE.

02:17:35.914 --> 02:17:38.917
THAT HAVE R. O. WOULD NOT GAIN

02:17:38.984 --> 02:17:40.385
AS MUCH MOVING TO ENROLLMENT

02:17:40.452 --> 02:17:41.853
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HIGH AVERAGE

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:44.322
DAILY ATTENDANCE PER. PUPILS IN

02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:46.124
THE DISTRICT NOW. THERE WOULD BE

02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:49.160
A REGION GERING WITH IN. THE OUR

02:17:49.227 --> 02:17:51.429
MINIMUM BETWEEN THOSE DISTRICTS

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:52.897
AND THE WINNERS MIGHT BE THOSE

02:17:52.964 --> 02:17:54.199
TO GAIN A LOT MORE IN

02:17:54.265 --> 02:17:55.900
ENROLLMENT. BECAUSE IT IS A

02:17:55.967 --> 02:17:57.836
FREE. BUT WHEN YOU'RE SAYING

02:17:57.902 --> 02:17:59.204
WITHIN THE GUARANTEED DOES THAT

02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:02.207
IMPLY THAT IT'S A FIXED PIE AND

02:18:02.273 --> 02:18:09.214
YOU'RE REALLOCATING THE SIX PI.

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.682
OUR THROUGH A NEW SYSTEM. THAT'S

02:18:10.749 --> 02:18:12.684
CORRECT RIGHT SO IT'S A BEEN WE

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:18.023
HAVE FUNDING IS THAT THE BY. THE

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:20.525
OVER THE LAST. DECADE THAT THE

02:18:20.592 --> 02:18:22.360
THAT I'VE BEEN AND THE OFFICE WE

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:24.629
ALL FUN THE STATE OF PROJECT WAS

02:18:24.696 --> 02:18:27.666
FUNDED AT. YOU THOUGHT IF THERE

02:18:27.732 --> 02:18:30.235
NOT GOING CHANGE MEANS THAT.

02:18:30.301 --> 02:18:32.737
MAKING IT HARDER TO SPEND BUT

02:18:32.804 --> 02:18:35.774
IMPROPER. SO THERE IS A THE

02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:39.411
AROMA WOULD A THOUGHT DEGREES.

02:18:39.477 --> 02:18:43.081
IN WOULD PROBABLY COSTS AND WHO

02:18:43.148 --> 02:18:44.816
WHO BENEFIT WILL DEPEND ON WHICH

02:18:44.883 --> 02:18:47.485
CAPTAIN RATES FOR. ATTENDANCE

02:18:47.552 --> 02:18:49.621
FOR A NORMAL. I DON'T REMEMBER

02:18:49.688 --> 02:18:51.790
BUT I THINK WE HAVE LOT. WE

02:18:51.856 --> 02:18:54.392
DON'T RECKON OUR B. THIRTY THAT

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:57.128
THE MUCH THE WANTED MOVE IN THIS

02:18:57.195 --> 02:19:03.034
YOU THINK ABOUT OUR. AND WITH

02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:05.403
OUR- SOME PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.205
IN SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE

02:19:07.272 --> 02:19:08.273
WAY WE FIND FUNDED ATTENDANCE

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:10.675
AMENDED IT DOES CRITICALLY. THE

02:19:10.742 --> 02:19:12.877
BIRTH DATE CURRENT OF DOES

02:19:12.944 --> 02:19:15.046
CRITICAL SCHOOLS LIKE. FOR

02:19:15.113 --> 02:19:16.948
SCHOOLS STUDENTS THAT STUDENTS

02:19:17.015 --> 02:19:18.383
ARE ATTENDING CLASS ON A REGULAR

02:19:18.450 --> 02:19:19.884
BASIS OF ALREADY PASSED AN

02:19:19.951 --> 02:19:23.121
IMPORTANT- THE TICKET THE IN.

02:19:23.188 --> 02:19:26.524
BIG I DID MEAN TO TAKE US TO BUT

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.460
DOES GOING TO BE A VIRGIN

02:19:28.526 --> 02:19:29.094
DISCUSS AMONG. AND I THINK YOU

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:30.995
ALL HAVE TO BE READY TO SPEAK TO

02:19:31.062 --> 02:19:32.731
IT AND IT WILL BE A NIGHTMARE

02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:34.566
FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE BASIC AID

02:19:34.632 --> 02:19:36.101
DISTRICTS THAN I'VE STRONGLY

02:19:36.167 --> 02:19:38.570
DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS IN MY-

02:19:38.636 --> 02:19:40.472
SENATE DISTRICT AND SOMEONE WHEN

02:19:40.538 --> 02:19:42.107
SOMEONE LOSE IF IT'S A FIXED

02:19:42.173 --> 02:19:44.175
PRICE AND THAT'LL BE A- A

02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:45.977
DIFFICULT DISCUSSION. AT BRAVO

02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:48.113
LET ME ASK OF MY COLLEAGUES IF

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:51.082
THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS.

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:53.251
CAR SENATOR MINUTES GOOD SENATE

02:19:53.318 --> 02:20:02.694
ROADSHOW. BOOK AMAZING SHE GOOD

02:20:02.761 --> 02:20:11.202
AS WELL. THE SO ARE LET ME JUST. ARE NOT BY MISTAKE THE FACT

02:20:11.269 --> 02:20:13.171
THAT THIS WAS PREFERRED SOME OF

02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:14.272
THE DISCUSS. FROM FACT THIS IS

02:20:14.339 --> 02:20:16.274
OF GREATER. THAN DIFFERENT

02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:18.376
PIECES OF THE- DISCO AND I THINK

02:20:18.443 --> 02:20:23.214
THAT WE WILL WANT- TO. JUST WE

02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:26.618
MOVE TOWARD. THE DAY M. P. OF

02:20:26.684 --> 02:20:29.387
ROLLING- THE THREE ROLLING YOU

02:20:29.454 --> 02:20:30.221
DON'T WANT WHAT IT MEANS COMING

02:20:30.288 --> 02:20:32.056
OUT OF IT IN I SUS. THAT FOR

02:20:32.123 --> 02:20:33.892
ALMOST CALLED WITH WE ARE AND TO

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:34.993
GET YOUR FEET BECAUSE WE'RE

02:20:35.059 --> 02:20:36.394
GOING TO BE REALLY ANXIOUS TO

02:20:36.461 --> 02:20:38.229
MAKE SURE THAT THAT THIS IS DONE

02:20:38.296 --> 02:20:40.799
IN A WAY THAT'S THAT EQUITABLE

02:20:40.865 --> 02:20:43.434
DOESN'T CREATE. DRAMA AT THE END

02:20:43.501 --> 02:20:46.337
OF IT AND WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT

02:20:46.404 --> 02:20:48.106
OR WE START TO PRESS FOR

02:20:48.173 --> 02:20:51.843
FLORIDA'S SO. I CAN JUST SAY OK

02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:53.077
CENTER BERMAN I WOULD ECHO THE

02:20:53.144 --> 02:20:54.579
CHAIR'S COMMENTS AND I WOULD

02:20:54.646 --> 02:20:57.115
ONLY JUST ADD THAT- MY LACK OF

02:20:57.182 --> 02:20:58.349
COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ON THIS

02:20:58.416 --> 02:20:59.884
POINT IS NOT A SIGN OF

02:20:59.951 --> 02:21:01.820
DISINTEREST BUT RATHER- IN THE

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:04.055
INTEREST OF TIME AND BASED ON-

02:21:04.122 --> 02:21:06.758
THE VERY THOROUGH EXAMINATION A

02:21:06.825 --> 02:21:07.759
LOT OF THE ISSUES I CARE ABOUT

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:10.628
WITH- MADE BY CHAIR LAYERED SO-

02:21:10.695 --> 02:21:13.298
I ALSO WOULD. LIKE TO CONTINUE

02:21:13.364 --> 02:21:14.799
TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE GOING

02:21:14.866 --> 02:21:16.000
FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE

02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:17.635
VERY IMPORTANT IN AND ONE OF THE

02:21:17.702 --> 02:21:18.703
THINGS I REALLY WANT TO

02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:19.871
UNDERSTAND BETTER IS TO WHAT

02:21:19.938 --> 02:21:21.873
DEGREE ARE WE SEEING A TEMPORARY

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:22.941
CODE RELATED DROP OFF IN

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:24.576
ENROLLMENT VERSUS THE LONGER

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:26.177
STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT WE SAW

02:21:26.244 --> 02:21:28.613
BEFORE CODED- AND WHAT ARE THE
