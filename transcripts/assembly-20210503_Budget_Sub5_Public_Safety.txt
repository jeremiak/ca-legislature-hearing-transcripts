OF COURSE JUST TO GET SOME BACKGROUND AND IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE BUREAU IDENTIFIED A BACKLOG OF TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE. I THINK HE SAID. AT THIRTY TWO POSITIONS WERE ESSENTIAL AND VITAL IN- ASSISTING IN REDUCING THAT BACKLOG SO I THINK MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE BACKLOG IS AT FORTY EIGHT HE SAID. I'M TWENTY TWO OF THOSE ARE MORE COMPLEX INVESTIGATIONS OF OWNERS AND I'M BUSINESSES THAT TYPICALLY TAKE LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE.

YEAH THAT THAT'S BETTER OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATIE HOWARD AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS WE'RE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER PC PETE THAT'S CONNECTED TO OUR WORK ON- FACILITY COUNTY FACILITY INSPECTIONS WE SPOKE WITH THIS COMMITTEE AT SOME LENGTH IN THE OF MARCH HEARING SO I WILL JUST QUICKLY MOVED TO. GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF WHAT IS IN THIS B. C. P. WHERE OF COURSE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE- THE B. C. P. PROPOSES FOURTEEN POSITIONS TO STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT- OF COUNTY DETENTION FACILITIES AND SO THAT'S EIGHT ADDITIONAL INSPECTOR POSITIONS AND SIX POSITIONS THAT ARE A COMBINATION OF MANAGERS AND ANALYSTS AND IN A VERY BRIEF SUMMARY- WE ARE PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS FROM ONCE OVER A TWO YEAR CYCLE. TO ANNUAL INSPECTIONS THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE DETAIL THAT I COULD GO INTO BUT THAT'S THE TOP LINE SUMMARY AS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR DIRECTED US IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TO STRENGTHEN JAIL OVERSIGHT AND WE'RE VERY VERY PLEASED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COME FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT WILL TRULY HELP TO MEET THE GOALS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON OVER THE LAST YEAR OF INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY MUCH MORE FREQUENT INFORMATION AT OUR PUBLIC BOARD MEETINGS- TO ALL OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL AS OUR MANY STAKEHOLDERS ON WHAT THE- ISSUES OF NON COMPLIANCE CAR- AND IN ADDITION A WHOLE LOT MORE- ACCOUNTABLE INFORMATION. ABOUT OUT OF COMPLIANCE ISSUES SO WITH THE ADDITIONAL ANALYTICAL STAFF AND IN MANAGEMENT STAFF AS WELL AS A DATABASE THAT WERE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE REGULAR INFORMATION ANALYZED TRENDS AND REPORT OUT TO OUR BOARD AND THE PUBLIC AND THE LEGISLATURE AND ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THESE- JAIL AND JUVENILE DETENTION INSPECTIONS. SO THAT IS- OF VERY QUICK- SUMMARY THAT WERE- WE HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT- PROVIDES FOR STREAMLINED PROCESS THESE AND SYSTEMS AND STRENGTHENS OUR- INSPECTION FUNCTION SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. THANK YOUR OUR NEXT PANELIST. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RENE MENOR COMMUNICATIONS AND POLICY ANALYST AT THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE TDCJ AND DOZENS OF OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MONITORED THE BSE SEASONS OF THE STOCK WHICH MEANT AND I PERSONALLY ATTENDED NEARLY EVERY BOARD MEETING IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. WE'VE WITNESSED THE BSE SEES FAILURES TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND LOCAL FACILITIES AND WE'VE SEEN THE AGENCY'S RELUCTANCE TO CORRECT COURSE TIME AND AGAIN. THESE FAILURES HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN THE RECENT LA- REPORT AND VARIOUS MEDIA INVESTIGATIONS. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL OFFERS ONLY SUPERFICIAL ACTIONS THAT ARE INSUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AGO. WHEN YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS PROPOSAL IT QUICKLY BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT FALL INTO CATEGORIES UNNECESSARY OR PREMATURE WITHOUT DEEPER REFORMS. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES A PLAN TO REPORT REGULARLY TO THE SEC BOARD DIRECTING AGENCIES TO APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD ON ISSUES OF NON COMPLIANCE. THIS IS ALREADY A BASIC RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BSE SEE THAT SHOULD NOT COME AT AN ADDITIONAL COST. WE AGREE WITH EXPLICITLY GRANTING THE BSE C. FORTY THE CARRY OUT UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS WHICH CAN ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT INCREASED FUNDING. HOWEVER WE MUST ASK THAT YOU REJECT THE REMAINDER OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. THE PLANS TO CHANGE THE FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND REPORTING COM AT INCREASED COSTS TO TAXPAYERS WITHOUT PROMISE FOR IMPROVEMENT. MORE INSPECTIONS AND FOLLOW UP TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WILL DO NOTHING TO INCREASE PROTECTIONS PARKING CARS READ LOVED ONES UNLESS THE ACTUAL STANDARDS AND QUALITY OF INSPECTIONS ARE VASTLY IMPROVED. WITH THE BSEE'S DEMONSTRATED RELUCTANCE TO HOLD COUNTIES ACCOUNTABLE DOING INSPECTIONS MORE FREQUENTLY WILL MERELY CONTAIN THE STATUS QUO WE'RE MAJOR HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS ARE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS SECRETARY CURRENT STATUTE REQUIRES THAT THE BSE C. CARRY OUT BIENNIAL INSPECTIONS THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCREASE THAT REQUIREMENT IN FACT THIS FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE PROPOSAL NOTING THAT FACILITIES FOUND TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES QUOTE MIGHT RECEIVE ANOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING SINCE THE PSEC TAKES A NARROW VIEW OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AND USES ITS DISCRETION TO ACT IN SERVICE OF COUNTIES RATHER THAN EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY. THE PROPOSAL ALLOWS THE AGENCY TO CONTINUE TO USE ITS DISCRETION FOR HANDS OFF APPROACH TO THE DETRIMENT OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED INSIDE LOCAL FACILITIES. IT'S WITH THIS THAT WE MUST AGAIN ASK FOR THE PROPOSAL TO BE REJECTED EXCEPT FORGET GRANTING CLEAR AUTHORITY FOR UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS. THE FAILURE OF THE BSE C. MUST BE ADDRESSED IN RESTRUCTURING ITS LEADERSHIP AS A FIRST AND IMMEDIATE STAFF. ONGOING PROBLEMS AT THE AGENCY ARE CAUSED BY STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES INCLUDING FUNK THERE OVERSIGHT GOALS AND PROBLEMATIC LEADERSHIP. YES HE SEES WITH CITY REGULATIONS AND INSPECTIONS ARE FAILING DUE TO AN AGENCY CULTURE THAT PRIORITIZES CORRECTIONAL PERSPECTIVES OVER BEST PRACTICES. RIGHT NOW EIGHT BOARD MEMBERS ARE CURRENT OR FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT- CORRECTIONS STAFF AND FOR THOSE BOARD MEMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO INSPECTIONS. THE BSE SEAT NEEDS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE AGENCIES THAT THEY OVERSEE BEFORE THE STATE BOLSTERS THEIR SPENDING FOR STAFFING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT WE HAVE THE L. A. L. OFFICE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAITLYN YOU KNOW ALEJO. AND AS WAS MENTIONED WE DID RELEASE A REPORT EARLIER THIS SPRING ON THE DSCC STANDARDS INSPECTIONS PROGRAM THAT WAS HEARD BY THE SCHOOL ON MARCH EIGHT. I'M JUST AS A BRIEF OVERVIEW WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE SAT EXPLICIT GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM AND STATUTES AS WELL AS A LINE B. MEMBERSHIP THE BOARD MEMBERSHIP WITH NO SCHOOLS AND REQUIRE BE AS EASY TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HOW IT WILL- REDESIGNED THE PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE. THAT GOAL WHATEVER GOALS THAT IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. CHOOSES TO FACT. I WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT APPROACH AND THAT'S ABOUT IT TO SPECIFIC PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TO DATE- WE THINK THAT IT TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE DOES WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR RECOMMENDED REFORMS WE THINK THAT IT WOULD. BE PREMATURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO BE A CC AT THIS POINT GIVEN THAT- THE LEGISLATIVE ONCE ABBY THE FCC SUBMITS ITS PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HAVE A LINE THE PROGRAM WITH. WHATEVER GOALS THE LEGISLATURE AT SECOND STATUTE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO RESOURCES ARE NEEDED- ENSURE THAT THE SEC'S PROGRAM CAN- CARRY OUT THOSE GOALS IN THAT IT IS OPERATING IN A MANNER THAT SUFFICIENT. AND CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. I'M THE OWNER TO EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ATTITUDE NOT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR RECOMMENDED REFORMS- WE WOULD ALSO RCOMMEND REJECTING THE RESOURCES ARE THERE THE REQUESTED STAFFING- BECAUSE- WE THINK THAT IT APPEARS THAT YOU KNOW BY AND LARGE THE SEC HAS KIND OF IMPLICITLY WELL DOESN'T HAVE EXPLICIT FILED STATUTORY GOAL CAN IMPLICITLY OPERATED- WITH THE GOAL OF HELPING COUNTIES. IDENTIFIED AND MEET LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND THAT IS ONE OF THE FOUR GOALS THAT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED FOR PSEC- THE DATE CHANGES THATTHE FCC HAVE BEEN MAKING OVER THE PAST YEAR IN THE POOL AND THE PROPOSED- BEFORE YOU AS WELL AS THE RESOURCES BEING REQUESTED WOULD LARGELY. GO TO SUPPORTING THIS CALL AND NOT TO THE OTHER THREE GOALS THAT WE RECOMMENDED- WHICH FOR EXAMPLE WERE TO PROVIDE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY- AND ACCOUNTABILITY OR FACILITATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. FOUNDED TENSION TO. AND SO WITH THAT SAID- WE THINK THERE WE DISEASE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE US JUST TO THE- THAT THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THAT ONE PARTICULAR GOAL OF- HELPING ME LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES AND DETERMINE MEET LEGAL REQUIREMENTS IN OTHER WORDS IT APPEARS THE PROPOSAL WOULD LARGELY INCREASE THE SERVICE LEVEL TO CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD. ANY EVIDENCE FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES ADJUSTING THE CURRENT SERVICE SERVICE LEVEL IS INADEQUATE SO WITHOUT REASON WE WOULD REJECT THE PROPOSAL RECOMMEND REJECTING EVEN IF ON THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT INTERESTED IN MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR RECOMMENDED REFORMS- AND THEN ONCE THAT FINAL NOTE IS THAT THERE IS ARE TO COMPLY OF THE PROPOSAL WE DO WORK APPROVING ONE- A HUNDRED FIFTY. THOUSAND DOLLARS I'M GOING. TO BE A FIFTY TWO. ALLOW INSPECTORS TO DATA. DURING INSPECTION WHICH WE THINK DOES MAKE SENSE- OUR LIST OF WHAT IT'S THE LEGISLATURE TO HIS BACK RECORD ARE- AND THEN IT. YOU BUDGET TRAILER LIKE TO ALLOW THE TO DO INSPECTIONS SEVERAL WE WOULD BE A TOOL FOR ITS TO GOING FORWARD AND I'M HAPPY TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR BE A SEAT AT OUR MARK HE THERE WAS A LAW OF CONCERN LOCAL. BY MEMBERS OF. AND THERE'S- A LOT OF ANXIETY AS WE WAIT FOR. A CALL ROOM TO ADDRESSING THE DEFICIENCIES IN OVERSIGHT OF JAIL AND FOR HOW DO YOU TO. THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES YOUR **** FOR. I AND ON THE COULD WE FROM. ONE OF THE THAT WE'RE GET A LOT OF THE SAME A LOT OF THE SAME UNTIL I. FUNDING THAT ONE WE VOCAL CONCERNS THE CRIME SITUATION. THANK YOU MADAM TO AGAIN KATIE HOW WITH THE BE A C. C. ARTICLE WE ARE- WE WILL STRONG. IN THE BUDGET CHAIN PROPOSED BEFORE IS. WERE TO DIRECTION WE RECEIVE- FROM THE GOVERNOR LAST TO STRENGTHEN IN JAIL- OVERSIGHT- CONTRARY TO. SOME OF WHAT'S BEEN STATED TODAY- OUR BOARD HAS ENGAGED- MUCH MORE DIRECTLY WITH INFORMATION AND REGULAR UPDATES AT EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC BOARD MEETING- ABOUT. THE WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE ENHANCED INSPECTION PROCESS OR E. I. P. AND- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE WITHIN THE CURRENT STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THAT THE B. SEC HOUSE WHICH IS- AS THE COMPLIANCE AGENCY. AND NOT A REGULATORY AGENCY AND SO PART OF WHAT I WOULD WANT TO JUST RESPOND TO IT AT LEAST IN. ONE IS THAT- YOU KNOW THE ALLEY. IS MADE THAT WE PREFERRED TO DO THINGS IN THE IN A WAY THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENTLY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS ABOUT PROBLEMS INSIDE THE COUNTY JAILS. THERE WE AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE MARCH- HEARING THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF THE- BENEFICIAL WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AND WILL BE DONE- UNDER THIS PROPOSAL BY HAVING MORE FREQUENT INSPECTIONS MORE REGULAR REPORTING TO THE BOARD MORE DETAILED INFORMATION GOING OUT TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT THE ITEMS OF NON COMPLIANCE. ARE AND INCREASED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- OUR TO THE COUNTIES SO WE THINK IT IS THAT IT IS RESPONSIVE AND THAT ARE- EXISTING INSPECTION PROCESS IS BENEFICIAL- CERTAINLY NOT ONLY TO THE COUNTIES- WHO ARE GETTING INSPECTED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH. REGULATIONS BUT ALSO WITH RESPECT TO- WHAT'S HAPPENING- AND THAT AFFECTS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. RESIDING IN THE COUNTY JAILS AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND LOVED ONES WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEM SO WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT'S VERY RESPONSIVE TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DIRECTED TO DO- TO STRENGTHEN THAT. THE JAIL OVERSIGHT. I THINK I THINK AT LEAST FOR MYSELF WE MIGHT HAVE TO DISAGREE FOR NOW BUT BEFORE AS THE DIGITAL QUESTIONS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. OKAY US THIS WOULD HAVE- THE TIONAL QUESTIONS WERE RECOMMENDING THAT WE HOLD THIS ITEM. OPEN AS AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD- WE HOPE TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT A PLAN OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS- TO. SHAKE JEFF DENIED DEFICIENCIES- NORTH OFFICIAL SO SHE YOU'RE NOT OUT OF JAIL. IT'S JEFF THE NEIGHBORHOOD APARTMENT FINANCE. ONE OF THE MORE REALLY QUICKLY IF. IN OVERSIGHT- SHE REPORTEDLY YES MIGHT THAT WE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT THE CENTRAL STATEMENT. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE LEGISLATURE ADVOCATES- ANYBODY WITH THANKS. LET'S HOUSING COUNTY JAIL. HUSET THE FOR THAT I WOULD THAT WE HAVE THE COMMON OF TRêN AND ACCOUNT IN THE SAID THE THAT I BEEN ASKED AT- AND THAT COULD AND I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WE ARE IN THE PATHWAY IT- TO FOR COMPREHENSIVE. REFORMS ENSURE THE WE HAVE OVERSIGHT AND THAT. BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH MY GONNA COME. WITH THAT SO WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CAN DISK A A THE FACT OPEN.

EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR INCREASED BASED SO WE AREN'T SURE NECESSARILY WHAT CAPACITY MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE GIVEN THOSE- AND INTERROGATION ISSUES WE ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT- THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG BOTH IN THE COUNTY JAILS AND IN THE STATE COURT SYSTEMS. WILL LIKELY RESULT IN SOME INCREASE IN PRISON POPULATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL- CONCERNS AND PROBLEMS WITH IDENTIFYING BREAKING FOR FUTURE CLOSURE OR EVEN INCLUDING ON A LIST- THOSE MEDICAL ISSUES WITH STAFFING. WE ANNOUNCE ESTRELAS THAT THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDED A CERTAIN NUMBER PRISON BETTER LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE COULD BE STAFFING CONCERNS YOU CAN ALSO. CAUSE ISSUES WITH IMPROVING THOSE FACILITIES IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE WAIT FOR THAT REASON CLOSER TO BE DETERMINED IF THOSE INSTITUTIONS IF THE LEGISLATURE HOLDS OFF ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THINGS LIKE FACILITIES OUR PROGRAMMING. I MAKE A COMPROMISE IN A- STAFF SAFETY ORDER ON REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM AT THAT FACILITIES. AND SO AGAIN WE ARE REALLY. SINCE AS WELL WE MAKING FUTURE INVEST IN PRISON THAT ARE. FOR CLOSE BUT WE CAN WANT IT IT'S BEING THE- I. AND REPEAT SOME ISSUES THAT WE HAD IN THE PAST. A PREVIOUS THANK TWELVE ZERO WAS FOR CLOSURE. IT DIDN'T END UP HAPPENING AND THERE WERE SOME SIGNIFICANT. LOSSES THERE FOR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES- IT DIDN'T OCCUR BECAUSE THE ANTICIPATION. FOR CLOSURE BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN SO CAN WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND I'M SORRY TO PROVIDE LISTS OF. POTENTIAL PRISON CLOSURES WITHOUT KIND OF FULLY ASSESSING. THE CURRENT SITUATION WHAT THINGS WILL LOOK LIKE. MANAGER YES THE JUNGLE IF I MAY THIS IS CAITLYN L'ITALIEN JUST TO QUICKLY OFFER- SOME AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON THOSE POINTS- THAT MINISTRATION IS PROJECTING A DECLINE IN THE INMATE POPULATION- THAT IT'S AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR ESTIMATES IS EXACTLY WHAT WE GET OUR ESTIMATE THAT- THE STATE COULD BE IN A POSITION TO CLOSE- 5% OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS- WELL THERE THERE IS OF COURSE AND CERTAINLY THERE'S ALWAYS UNCERTAINTY- AROUND POPULATION PROJECTIONS AND WE WOULDN'T WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T RECOMMEND MOVING FORWARD OUT OF PRISON CLOSURE IF IT WOULD COMPROMISE PUBLIC HEALTH OR- YOU KNOW. EXACERBATE A LAWSUIT SITUATION- HOWEVER WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE AWARE OF- WHAT PRISONS ARE LIMITATION IS CONSIDERING FOR CLOSURE SO THAT IT CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT CAPITAL OUTLAY AS THESE PROJECTS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND- THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE SYSTEM SO- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE MADE- WHERE THEY'RE MOST NEEDED MORE THERE AND HAVE THEM BUT THE BIGGEST LONG TERM BENEFITS FOR THE STATE'S OKAY YES THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ON THE POPULATION BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T WE'RE. MAKING DECISIONS NONETHELESS SO. THE HAVING FROM ON. AND THEN ON THE SECOND POINT ABOUT- STAFFING ISSUES. WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT AS A PROHIBITIVE ISSUE OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE TRADE OFFS WITH ANY KIND OF OPERATIONAL DECISION AND PRESENT ANNOUNCEMENT- BUT THERE MAY BE ALTERNATIVE. SOLUTIONS TO CONSIDER SUCH AS OFFERING- BONUSES FOR STAFF TO AND I STAYED AT THE PRESENT UNTIL IT IS CLOSED- RATHER THAN MOVING ON- I ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN WE VISITED ACT C. R. C. IN THE MORNING HAD ACTUALLY INDICATED THAT SHE WAS USING. PRISON BEATS ARE EXPECT ARE PRESENT CLOSER TO THAT HAS BEEN A ON THAT PRISON OVER THE PAST. COUPLE DECADES AS A WAY TO MOTIVATE STAFF TO DO BETTER AND BETTER SO- AND IT'S CETAINLY- HAD BEEN AWARE THAT THE PRISON WAS HAD BEEN PUT ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK IN THE PAST BUT IT WHAT. IT SEEMED TO BE SOMETHING THAT ONLY KIND MOTIVATED THEM SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT OUT POINT OUT THOSE AT IS WELL AS THE FACT THAT STAFF MIGHT REALLY APPRECIATE KNOWING THAT- THAT THEY MAY ONLY BE UP THIS PERSON FOR NUMBER. ANOTHER TWO OR THREE YEARS AND CAN PLAN THEIR LIFE- ACCORDINGLY SO JUST WANTED. TO ADD THAT THOSE KIND OF POINTS THANK YOU. LIKE I TO MAKE SURE YOUR COME. AND THAT SORT OF YOU- DID HAVE A FOLLOW UP BASED ON THE ANSWER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE. I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA GET A BETTER. I GUESS I SHOULD AS A METHOD OF STUDY BUT- HE HAD AN ANSWER. I THINK THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN CLEAR IN THE LAST YEAR INTO THAT THE SENSORS THAT HAVE BEEN SATISFACTORY OF THE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I COULD GO BACK TO SOME OF THE ANSWERS HE GAVE HIM TO MISTER LUCKY'S QUESTIONS HE TALKED ABOUT THERE BEING A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG- CAN YOU EXPLAIN OR- EXPAND ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- AS A RESULT THE CURRENT AFFAIRS AND I THINK WE IT THE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THAT A TEMPORARY STOPPAGE THE INTAKE TWO PRESENTS FROM COUNTY JAIL START BELIEVE THERE'S A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND INMATES. WE'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO SEE IF THERE ARE. STILL AWAITING. A COUNTY JAIL TRANSFER THE RECENTLY REOPENED THAT TRANSFER- THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS SO IT'S RAMPING UP BUT THERE IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG THAT. WE ARE ALSO UNSURE OF THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT AFFAIRS ENDEMIC ON COUNTY COURT COMMITMENTS. AND THEIR ACTUAL ACTIONS AS FAR AS HAVING THOSE HEARINGS AND SENTENCING INDIVIDUALS TO PRISONS IN JAIL. SO WE AREN'T YET SURE OF WHAT THE INCREASE. ON THE COURT. WORK BUT MIGHT RESULT. IN AS FAR AS HE DISCOVERS POPULATION. THIS IS A MATH EATING THERE'S ABOUT AT THAT. CASES THEM BACK WILL BUT- ACCORDING TO THE REPORT THAT THE L. A. O. REFERENCE THEIR SHIFTING SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND. NOTIFY A THOUSAND CURRENTLY OR SELL IN COUNTY JAILS AND AN UNKNOWN AMOUNT POTENTIALLY IN THE COURTS. ARM OKAY SO WHEN YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON. ON SOME OF THOSE I KNOW WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THAT WITH US. AS WELL AND THEN YOU ALSO REFERENCE- THAN CERTAINTY WITH. OVER IN THE PANDEMIC THE WORLD IN DEALING WITH AND WE ARE. EVERY DAVIS WITH THE ANSWERED ANY- AND ARE LESS OUT THERE BUT WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN. THE NATION ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING- AT WITH CDC ARE. I THINK THERE'S AN 80% ACCEPTANCE RATE FROM. INMATES THERE AS WELL AND WE'VE SEEN A STEEP DECLINE IN AFFECTION FULFILL PHYSICIANS- THERE AS WELL. AND SO IS IT FAIR TO CONTINUE SO THAT THERE IS THIS LARGE UNKNOWN DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. THIS PARTICULAR PANDEMIC YES BUT IT AGAIN IS. OBVIOUSLY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE LAST YEAR AND SO WE AREN'T NECESSARILY SURE FUTURE PANDEMICS OR ANY. FUTURE POTENTIAL PATHOGENS AND I DO HAVE A ACTUALLY ON THAT COURT AGUIAR-CURRY MADAM CHAIR OF THE COURT RIGHT NOW HAS A BACKLOG OF ABOUT. SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND TO NINETY THOUSAND FELONY CASE. SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND TO NINETY THOUSAND BACKLOGGED CASES. YES IN ABOUT 12% OF THOSE ARE COMING TO CREEK GENERALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS.
