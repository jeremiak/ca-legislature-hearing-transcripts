THE AYES HAVE IT THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED. THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER. THREE AJ ARE FIVE CORPORATION. ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER AND OTHERS RELATIVE THE FIREARM SAFETY. MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION AJ ARE FIVE URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO USE CALIFORNIA AS A MODEL FOR REASONABLE FIRE ARM SAFETY AS WE WORK TO PASS. NATION WHY FIREARM SAFETY REGULATION IN COMPARISON TO THE REST OF THE NATION CALIFORNIA RANKED THIRD IN GUN HOMICIDES AND SIXTEENTH AND GUN DEATHS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. BUT BY TWENTY SIXTEEN APPROVED TO TWENTY FIFTH IN GUN HOMICIDES PER CAPITA WITH THE EIGHTH LAW LOWEST RATE OF GUN RELATED DEATHS NATIONWIDE. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE HIS GUN VIOLENCE STATISTICS TO COMMONSENSE FIREARMS. AS MENTIONED IN THE AG ARE IF pCRIME IN CALIFORNIA THAT PERSON IS FORBIDDEN FROM PURCHASING OR POSSESSING FIREARMS. CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE TO ENACT A GUN PROTECTION ORDER IN MOST STATES. AND NINETEEN NINETIES CALIFORNIA BAND MULTI BURST TRIGGER ACTIVATORS AND LAST AND LAST SESSION UPDATED AT BAND TO MAKE IT CLEAR BUMP STOCKS IS ONE AND THE SAME AS A MULTI BURST TRIGGER ACTIVATOR. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IT A PRIORITY UNDERSTAND A ROOT CAUSE OF GUN VIOLENCE BY CREATING A FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. LASTLY CALIFORNIA ENSURES BYRAM USERS ARE PROTECTED FROM UNSAFE FIREARMS BY PROHIBITING THE MANUFACTURING AND IMPORTATION OF UNSAFE HAND GUNS INTO THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S PROVEN STRONGER FIREARM SAFETY LAWS CAN LEAD TO A REDUCED RATE OF GUN VIOLENCE WHICH INSURES PUBLIC SAFETY WHILE SOME MIGHT ARGUE JUST RESOLUTION IS NOT LEAD NEEDED LET ME POINT. THEM TO AN FBI STUDY THAT FOUND SHOOTING WERE PURCHASED LEGALLY THIS IS WHY AJ ARE FIVE IS NEEDED. TO LET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NO IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC THAT THIS NATION ADDRESSES HIS GUN VIOLENCE BY CREATING UNIVERSE OR FIREARM SAFETY STANDARDS THEY'RE STRONG AND REASONABLE. CONTINUE JUST TO SUBJECT OUR COMMUNITIES TO THE PAIN AND SUFFERING CAUSED BY GUN VIOLENCE DOES NOT MAKE SENSE WHEN WE HAVE A PROVEN WAY OF REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE. GUN VIOLENCE IS THE DISEASE THAT IS DESTROYING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT VICTIMS AND IT'S TIME WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THIS DISEASE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER. MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED -- THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- YOU KNOW THOUGH I UNDERSTAND WHERE MY COLLEAGUE IS COMING FROM -- WITH THIS RESOLUTION AND CERTAINLY I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS BODY. WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE -- GUN VIOLENCE IN ACTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED AND IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES FRANKLY -- IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK THERE'S THOSE OF US IN THIS BY THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY. DISAGREE THAT SOME OF THE LAWS THAT WE PASSED OF ACTUALLY. DONE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY PREVENTED HAPPENING BECAUSE THE REALITY IS. AS MUCH AS WE PASSED MANY GUN LAWS OVER THE YEARS -- MOSTLY PROHIBITING LAW ABIDING PEOPLE FROM OWNING. FIREARMS THAT THEY ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY ABLE TO HAVE -- WE STILL HAVE MASS SHOOTINGS LIKE THE ONE THAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT -- AND TO HIM A COUNTY. LIKE THOUSAND OAKS THAT HAPPENED -- JUST HERE RECENTLY LIKE SAN BERNADINO. WHERE ARE NONE THE LESS? SOME FOLKS WHO PROBABLY SHOULDN'T OF HAD THOSE WEAPONS STILL SON FOUND A WAY TO GET A HOLD OF THEM AND CARRY OUT. SOME VERY TRAGIC ATTACKS AGAINST OUR PEOPLE AND IN MY CASE IN MY COMMUNITY. WE HAD A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM. HAD ACTUALLY TURNED OVER A HANDGUN TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF AND YET. SOMEHOW STILL MANAGE TO GET A WEAPON. STILL MANAGED TO OBTAIN IT. AND USE IT AGAINST PEOPLE ONE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE NOT ADDRESS AND WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT BUT THERE'S BEEN NO REAL ACTION. MOSTLY FROM. OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL. OUR CURRENT ONE AND OUR PREVIOUS ONE IS ENFORCING THE APPS PROGRAM AND ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO ARE PROHIBITED PERSONS PEOPLE WITH FELONIES. PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DOCUMENT A MATH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. GETTING THOSE GUNS OUT OF THEIR HANDS. WE STILL HAVE. LAST YEAR WE HAD TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THAT LIST WHO HAD NOT BEEN VISITED. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPS PROGRAM NOW IT'S OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. LET THAT FACT SINK IN FOR YOU. IT'S NOT ABOUT PASSING MORE LAWS GOING AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. AND RESTRICTING THEIR ABILITY TO OWN FIREARMS. IT'S ABOUT GETTING NOT THOSE. WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO CARRY OUT THESE TYPES OF ATTACKS? AND ENSURING THAT THAT HAPPENS. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO ON THAT FRONT. IN MY OPINION. AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT SAYING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT HEY YOU SHOULD PASS ALL THESE LAWS THAT WE PASS WHICH HAVEN'T PREVENTED. GUN DEATHS IN OUR STATE APPROACH AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION TO SPEAK ON THE RESOLUTION. MISTER JONES ARE YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW. THE THE RESOLUTION REALLY. TALKS ABOUT HAVING TO FUND IT THE FUNDAMENTAL DUTY OF EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL ESPECIALLY IN WASHINGTON DC TO HAVE THIS DEBATE. WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY IS WE CAN DEBATE THESE ISSUES ON THIS FLOOR. AND HAVE AN ACTION TAKEN AFTER THAT. NOT ALL OF THE BILLS THAT HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS HOUSE OF GOING TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN. HAVE BEEN VOTED NIGH SO MAY HAVE BEEN VETO. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE A OF A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE WHICH I WOULD SUBMIT. IS A REAL PROBLEM NOT ONLY IN THIS NATION. BUT AS WE OPEN DESERVED IN OTHER NATIONS BECOMING A GROWING AND GROWING PROBLEM. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING IN ACTION IS NOT THE SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION IS EVERYONE COMING TOGETHER AND COMING TO WHAT IDEAS. AND STRATEGIES TO CURB THIS PERSON AND PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS JONES SAWYER WOULD YOU LIKE CO AUTHORS ON THE FIRST ROW YES I WOULD. WITH THAT CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE MEMBERS THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS ON AJ ARE FIVE THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS. ON THE RESOLUTION. THIS IS CO AUTHORS. THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS. SAYS FOR CO AUTHORS ADDING ON TO THE RESOLUTION. THE CLERK WELL. CLOSE ROLE THERE ARE FORTY EIGHT NINE CO AUTHORS ADDED THIS IS AN H.

BECAUSE EVERYWHERE I GO EVERY FOUR I GO IN. I SEE THE INNOVATIONS THAT OUR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS COME UP WITH. WHETHER IT'S RECYCLING WATER. GOING THROUGH NEW WAYS OF PROCESSING THINGS [inaudible] IT. WE ARE AT THE KEY IN THE LEADING EDGE OF EVERYTHING. AN AGRICULTURAL IN THE ENTIRE WORLD RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S REALLY AMAZING THAT WE GET TO SEE THIS HERE THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST AG STATE. IN THE NATION WE WE ARE THE BREAD BASKET OF THE WORLD. BUT IF YOU REALLY STOP AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT. AG IS EVERYTHING. IT'S THE SHOES YOUR WERE IN THE SOCKS ON YOUR FEET. YOUR SUIT YOUR CLOTHES YOUR DRESSES. IT'S EVERYWHERE. EVERY SINGLE THING WE HAVE COME FROM AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. IN THAT'S WHY I JUST WANNA SAY HASH TAG THINK OF FORMER. MISTER DALLI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS UP THINK MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD -- AS YOU KNOW IN THE DELI FAMILY EVERY DAY IS ACT DAY AND PROUD TO BE. A FARMER THAT TO SERVE ON THIS FLOOR I'M I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT CALIFORNIA PRODUCES. ALL KINDS OF COMMODITIES BUT I WANT TO SHARE THE THAT THE MAIN THING IS THAT THEY'RE THE SAFEST COMMODITIES IN THE WORLD WE HAVE. MORE. REGULATIONS PUT ON CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND WE STILL PROVIDE. A GOOD SAFE PRODUCT NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT FOR THE WORLD SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO COME OUT NEXT WEDNESDAY. AND SEE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THE KIDS ARE OUT THERE. SHARING WHAT -- AGAS ABOUT IN CAL AND I JUST WANNA SAY ONE LAST THING CLOSING. EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A BITE OF FOOD THINK THINK OF A FARMER BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT PUT IT TO YOUR TABLE. I IN STE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISTER DALLI. IS COOLEY YOUR RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I'M DELIGHTED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. I TRAVELED OVER THE WEEKEND SPENT TIME WITH LAWMAKERS FROM. OTHER OF THE FIFTY STATES. AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO FIND AT DINNER. THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO HOW. ON THE EAST COAST. WHEN THEY WINNER GROCERY STORES AND WINNER? THEY MARVELED AT THE ABUNDANCE OF PRODUCE OF ALLCAME FROM CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IDEA THAT WE ARE THE BREAD BASKET TO THE NATION. THE BREAD BASKET OF THE GLOBE. YOU KNOW PART OF CALIFORNIA'S GLOBAL BRAND IS IS NOT JUST OUR PRODUCE. TO PROTECT US OF OUR FIELDS. BUT IT'S THE HELPFUL QUALITY OF AND I THINK CALIFORNIA ENJOYS A REP. REPUTATION. THAT THE FOOD GROWN HERE IS GROWN WITH SAFE WHOLESOME PRACTICES. THAT THE AMOUNT OF RESIDUES ON THE FOOD THIS SORT OF THING ARE NOT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT SO. WE WE HAVE THIS EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY IN THE STATE WE ARE INDEED THE BREAD BASKET OF THE NATION. AND NATURALLY THIS BECAUSE WE TO OBSERVE THE ON THE UPPER WALL OF THE ROTUNDA [inaudible] THERE ARE. THIRTY SIX THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT HORNS OF PLENTY THAT TUMBLE DOWN. BANNERS TO PRODUCE THE RING THE UPPER WALL OF THE ROTUNDA. OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE WAS LEFT IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTY DOORS -- BELOW MISTER AROUND OVER THERE ON THE SECOND FLOOR IF YOU LOOK UP CAPITOL MALL. WE HAVE ALWAYS SEEN OURSELVES AS THIS PRODUCTIVE SPOT. AND LIVING IN CALIFORNIA SEASON TAKE FOR GRANTED BUT IN FACT IT IS SOMETHING IS. BECOMES A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WHEN YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY AND WINNER. IN A DEED IN THE GLOW. SO IT'S A GREAT THING TO CELEBRATE ON THIS AND I THINK THE MEMBER FROM STOCKTON. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY WHICH PATTERSON YOUR RECOGNIZE THE SPEAKER MEMBERS OF I RISE BOB THIS RESOLUTION BUT I ALSO RISE WITH A WORD OF CAUTION. CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE TODAY IS UNDER SUBSTANTIAL AND SIGNIFICANT STRESS. THEN I THINK THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AND REMEMBER. THAT MUCH OF WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE PRODUCES IN THE WAY OF REGULATION. AT IN TAXES AND IN WATER POLICY. HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD ASK THAT THE NEXT TIME WE LOOK AT OF A BILL OR A CONSTRICTION OF OF WATER TO AGRICULTURE THE NEXT TIME WE ARE WARNED BY AGRICULTURE THAT THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES HAPPENING TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUT OF THIS -- OUT OF THIS BUILDING. I REPRESENT THEIR FRESNO CALIFORNIA WAS THE MAYOR THERE FOR EIGHT YEARS AND NOW REPRESENT THEM UP HERE. FRESNO IS THE FIFTH LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS THE CITY THAT AGRICULTURE HAS BUILT. REPEATEDLY I GO BACK TO MY HOMETOWN AND TALK TO PEOPLE IN AGRICULTURE I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE FACING IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. THE POSSIBILITY OF A HALF A MILLION ACRES OF PRIME AGRICULTURE FOLLOWED BECAUSE OF THE INSECURITY OF WATER. THERE ARE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN MANY OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS THINK ABOUT ACTUALLY% LEAVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS WHO RECENTLY HAVE GIVEN UP ON CALIFORNIA AND HAVE TAKEN THEIR AGRICULTURE TO OTHER PLACES BELIEVE IT OR NOT. SOME OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE HIGH COST OF ELECTRICITY SOME OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE HIGH COST OF ENERGY. SOME OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE IN SECURITY OF THOUGHT WATER. AND SO ALTHOUGH THIS IS A TIME TO CELEBRATE WITH JOY THE BOUNTIES OF AGRICULTURE. MEMBERS PLEASE. KEEP IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND. THAT AGRICULTURE PRESENTLY IS UNDER SIGNIFICANT STRESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND LET'S NOT MISS. THE NEWS THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO IN ORDER TO MAYBE TURN THE TIDE. ON THAT IN SECURITY AND PAY OF A SOME SPECIFIC ATTENTION. TO THE WAY IN THE MANNER IN WHICH WE CAN. HONESTLY AND EFFECTIVELY BUT YET WITH A SINCERE SUPPORT FOR AGRICULTURE. LEGISLATE IN THIS. CURRENT CONDITION. AND SO I RISE TO SUPPORT BUT ALSO WITH A CAUTIONARY WARNING THAT THINGS ARE NOT ALL AS ROSY AS THEY SEEM AN AGRICULTURE. AND WE NEED TO LISTEN TO AGRICULTURE WHEN THEY SAY THIS KEEPS US AWAKE AT NIGHT. AND WE ARE CHALLENGED BY THESE REAL POSSIBILITIES SO LET'S CELEBRATE TODAY. BUT LET'S BE CAREFUL TOMORROW THANK YOU.
