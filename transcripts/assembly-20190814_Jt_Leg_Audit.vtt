00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:45.843
THESE ARE EXCERPTS FROM THE

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:46.677
AUDIT REPORT THAT REALLY

00:45:46.743 --> 00:45:48.879
DEMONSTRATE THE ISSUES THAT

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:49.480
WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN A VARIETY

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:52.549
OF AREAS. SO THE FIRST AREA

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:53.984
THAT A MISSILE IS ON I WAS

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.385
GOING TO TALK ABOUT. REALLY

00:45:55.452 --> 00:45:58.088
FOCUSES ON FUNDING FEES BILLING

00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:01.158
PRACTICES SO WE HAVE. THREE OR

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:02.426
FOUR KEY ISSUES IN THIS

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:03.894
PARTICULAR AREA THIS UMBRELLA

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:05.496
OF FUNDING AND BILLING. ONE IS

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:07.164
THAT THE FEES THAT THE BUREAU

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:08.632
CHARGES DOES NOT REALLY ALIGNED

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.667
WITH THE COSTS. SO SOME AT SOME

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:12.202
INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING OVER

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:14.037
CHARGED WHILE OTHERS ARE BEING

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:15.739
UNDER CHARGED FOR THE SERVICES

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:16.974

SHE'LL GET INTO SPECIFICS WITH

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.010
RESPECT TO THAT. THERE IS A

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:22.746
MISALIGNMENT WITH. THE COSTS

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:24.515
FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND WHAT

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:26.984
FEES. INDIVIDUALS ARE PAYING.

ALSO IT AS A CHAIRMAN MENTIONED

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:30.721
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE HAVE

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:31.722
IN THE AUDIT REPORT IS THE FUND

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:33.957
BALANCE FOR THE GAMBLING

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:36.860
COMMISSION ARE. INCREASING

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.195
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST FIVE

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:39.930
YEARS AND THERE IS A GRAPHIC I

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:40.731
IN THE HANDOUTS THAT

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.299
DEMONSTRATES THAT. THE JUDGE

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:44.401
THE FUND BALANCE HAS DOUBLED IN

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.103
THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN ADDITION

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.838
THERE WILL BE A REPAYMENT OR

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:49.740
IT. MAY HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED A

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:52.643
REPAYMENT TOM FROM A LOAN. FROM

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:53.577
THE GENERAL FUND THAT EVEN

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:55.579
BUMPS THAT JET THAT FUND

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.080
BALANCE UP EVEN MORE SO MORE

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.883
THAN DOUBLE. IN FIVE YEARS BUT

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:00.817
THEN THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT SO

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:02.986
THEY HAVE A HUGE FUND BALANCE

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:05.489
WHICH THEY COULD USE. TO

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.791
HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:10.427

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:14.398
AREA WHERE WE SAW

00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:15.799
INCONSISTENCIES IN THEIR

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:17.401

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:40.157
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF

00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:42.292
THE TIME SHEETS AND THE TIME

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.493
REPORTING WE'RE SEEING NON

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.229
BILLABLE HOURS AND ACTUALLY

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:46.763
NINE CASE HOURS. SO WE REALLY

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.198
ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS WITH

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:49.566
RESPECT TO THAT YOUR STAFF FOR

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:51.468
NOT SPENDING. MOST OF THEIR

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.337
TIME DOING A JOB THE

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:54.705
RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING WHICH IS

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:56.173
REVIEWING APPLICATIONS. SO

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.009
THOSE ARE THE FOUR KEY ISSUES

00:47:59.076 --> 00:47:59.543
UNDER FUNDING AND BILLING

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:03.247
ISSUES. WHEN MR REINER HE

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:03.880
SPEAKS HE'S GOING TO ADDRESS A

00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:05.249
COUPLE OF AREAS ONE IS RELATED

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:07.551
TO LICENSING APPLICATIONS.

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:08.685
THERE'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:48:08.752 --> 00:48:10.387
DAY TIME FRAME FOR WHICH THE

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:11.722
BUREAU IS SUPPOSED TO REVIEW

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:14.224
APPLICATIONS. IN MOST INSTANCES

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.292
THEY ARE EXCEEDING THAT

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.894
STATUTORY TIME FRAME AND NOT

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:18.629
GETTING THOSE APPLICATIONS

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:21.431
REVIEWED. OUR AS PROMPTLY AS

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:24.201
THEY SHOULD. IN LOOKING AT

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:26.270
STAFFING INCREASES THE

00:48:26.336 --> 00:48:26.803
LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN. THE

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.806
BUREAU. INCREASES IN LICENSING

00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:32.075
STAFF ON SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:33.777
ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE THE STAFF

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:34.711
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.847
PRODUCTIVITY UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.248
PRODUCTIVITY DIDN'T REFLECT THE

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:40.350
INCREASE IN STAFFING SOME OF IT

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.152
PERHAPS IS RELATED TO THE FACT

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:43.287
THAT THEY'RE NOT SPENDING A LOT

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:45.656
OF TIME. ON CASES THERE'S THEY

00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:46.790
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF NON BILLABLE

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:48.592
HOURS NINE CASE HOURS SO WE

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:50.327
WERE EXPECTING TO SEE WHEN THE

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:51.728
LEGISLATURE PROVIDED THOSE

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:52.796
TEMPORARY POSITIONS THAT HAVE

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:53.964
ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED THEIR

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.332
STAFF. THAT THERE WOULD BE AN

00:48:55.399 --> 00:48:56.867
INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY IN A

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:57.834
REDUCTION IN THE IN THE

00:48:57.901 --> 00:49:00.337
BACKLOG. THERE HAS BEEN A

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:00.904
REDUCTION IN THE BACKLOG BUT

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:03.073
NOT TO THE POINT. WHERE IT

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.775
SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AMOUNT

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.476
OF STAFFING THAT THE

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:07.110
LEGISLATURE HAS HAS PROVIDED TO

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:09.713
THE BUREAU. IN ADDITION WE

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:10.681
LOOKED AT SOME OF THE

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:12.215
REGULATORY PROCESSES WITH

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:13.517
RESPECT TO DENIALS OF

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:16.053
APPLICATIONS. AND WE SAW SOME

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.788
SOME WEAKNESSES IN THAT PROCESS

00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:20.257
THEY THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE. AN

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:21.992
EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND WHEN WE

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.427
LOOKED AT THE REGULATIONS THE

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:25.362
TIME FRAMES IN THE REGULATIONS

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:27.130
ACTUALLY EXCEED. A HUNDRED AND

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:28.732
TWENTY DAY A TIME FRAME THAT

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:29.499
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.401
THOSE THOSE DECISIONS MADE THEY

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:33.036
ACTUALLY HAVE REGULATIONS THAT

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:34.438
TAKE IT OUT TWO HUNDRED AND

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:35.539
THIRTY FIVE DAYS. SO THERE'S A

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:37.441
REAL DISCONNECTED THEY ARE WITH

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:40.577
RESPECT TO HOW THEY PROCESS

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:41.178
APPLICATIONS AND THOSE THAT GO

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:44.147
BEFORE THE COMMISSION. THE LAST

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.949
AREA THE UMBRELLA AREAS REALLY

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:46.850
WHAT SOME OF THE MEMBERS

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:48.385
MENTIONED UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:50.587
APPLICANTS SO LICENSING

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:52.622
APPLICANTS FROM CARD ROOMS.

00:49:52.689 --> 00:49:54.024
DIFFER FROM THOSE AS FAR AS

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:55.625
THIRD PARTY APPLICANTS AND

00:49:55.692 --> 00:49:56.960
THEIR TREATMENT IS DIFFERENT AS

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:58.762
FAR AS- A THIRD PARTY

00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:59.696
APPLICANTS CAN HAVE A

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:02.299
TEMPORARY. A LICENSE AND THEY

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.500
CAN KEEP THAT LICENSE UNTIL IT

00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:05.602
ACTUALLY DENIED. LICENSING

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.938
APPLICANTS FOR CARD ROOMS. THEY

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.873
LOSE THAT LICENSE AS SOON AS

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.374
THERE'S THAT THERE'S A

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.309
RECOMMENDATION. THAT THEY BE

00:50:12.376 --> 00:50:14.010
DENIED A LICENSE SO WE SAW SOME

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:15.779
REAL INCONSISTENCIES IN AGAIN

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.881
MISTER RANDY WILL STEP INTO A

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.616
BIT MORE DETAIL WITH RESPECT TO

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.752
THAT. SIMILARLY IN LOOKING AT

00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:23.420
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS THAT

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:24.821
ARE CONDUCTED WE SAW

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:26.723
INCONSISTENCIES THERE AND WE

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.024
TRIED TO REALLY DRILL DOWN AND

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:30.026
TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY ARE THERE

00:50:30.093 --> 00:50:32.062
INCONSISTENCIES UNFORTUNATELY

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:33.163
WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.432
DOCUMENT RETENTION. I ASKED FOR

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:36.700
MATERIALS TO SUPPORT SOME OF

00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:38.368
THOSE DECISIONS THE RETENTION

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:40.203
POLICIES WERE NOT VERY GOOD SO

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.038
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SEE. SOME OF

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.140
THE EVIDENCE THAT WE WERE

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:44.374
EXPECTING TO SEE THAT WOULD

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:46.109
HELP US UNDERSTAND THEIR

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:49.012
DECISION MAKING PROCESS SO WE

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:49.613
HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS WITH

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:53.850
RESPECT TO THAT. AND THEN THE

00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:55.185
LAST ISSUE ON UNDER THE UNEQUAL

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:55.852
TREATMENT IS IF THERE ISN'T AS

00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:57.120
AN INDIVIDUAL WHERE THERE'S A

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.221
RECOMMENDATION TO THE

00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:59.489
COMMISSION FOR THAT. THAT

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:00.857
LICENSE APPLICATION TO BE

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:03.493
DENIED THAT PERSON IS NOT

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.830
REALLY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY.

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.198
TO OPT OUT AND NOT HAVE THAT

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.801
EVIDENTIARY HEARING HAPPEN.

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:12.769
SOME FOLKS CAN OPT OUT BUT THE

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.304
COMMISSION MOVES AHEAD AND HAS

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.740
A HEARING AND THEN PUBLICLY

00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:19.009
DESCRIBES THE DECISION. AND IN

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:20.544
SOME CASES THAT'S HARMFUL TO

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:21.912
THOSE APPLICANTS WHERE THEY'VE

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.346
DECIDED I DON'T WANT TO.

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:25.182
CONTINUE IN THE PROCESS AND WE

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.317
NEED TO STOP I'M OPTING OUT BUT

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:28.752
THE COMMISSION GOES AHEAD AND

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:30.187
MOVES FORWARD WITH THAT SO

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:31.588
THOSE ARE THE THEY'RE VERY HIGH

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:33.323
LEVEL ISSUES. THAT WE

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.891

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:37.894
OF DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS

00:51:37.961 --> 00:51:39.329
ARE TO BOTH THE BUREAU AND THE

00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:41.465
COMMISSION. AND AGAIN AS STAFF

THEY'LL THEY'LL TALK TO YOU A

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:45.402
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUE

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:47.070
WAS AND WHAT WE'VE RECOMMENDED

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:51.007
SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO IS

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:51.608
LOZANO AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:56.546

AUDITOR INDICATED I'M GOING TO

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:05.489
COVER THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:08.024
REGULATORY DUTIES OF THE BUREAU

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:10.160
AND THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:12.762
THE FEE STRUCTURE CURRENTLY

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:15.665
THERE'S TWO TYPES OF FEES ARE

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:16.199
COLLECTED IN THE GAMBLING

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:19.035
CONTROL FUN. LICENSING FEES

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:20.403
THAT ARE PAID BY THE LICENSE

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.339
APPLICANTS AS WELL AS

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.074
BACKGROUND DEPOSITS FOR THE

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.742
ACTUAL INVESTIGATION THAT THE

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.845
BUREAU CONDUCTS THOSE THAT'S

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:33.083
ONE AREA. UP FUNDING THAT GOES

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.985
INTO THE GAMBLING CONTROL PLAN

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:37.587
AND THE SECOND AREA IS WHAT WE

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:38.989
REFER TO IN THE REPORT AS OTHER

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:41.558
REGULATORY FEES AND THESE ARE

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:42.459
THE AND FEES THAT ARE PAID BY

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:45.161
THE CARD ROOM OWNERS. AND THE

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:48.064
THIRD PARTY COMPANY OWNERS THE

00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:50.901
CARBON A CARD ROOM OWNERS PAY

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:53.003
BASED ON THEIR NUMBER OF TABLES

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:55.972
OR TOTAL REVENUE. AND THE THIRD

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.507
PARTY COMPANY OWNERS PAY BASED

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:59.910
ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND

THE USER FEES ARE PAID

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:03.413
ANNUALLY. SO THOSE TWO BUCKETS

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.714
ARE KIND OF WHAT IS MAKING UP

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:07.050
THE FUNDS ARE GOING INTO THE

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:10.053
GAMBLING CONTROL FUN. AND IT'S

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.987
IMPORTANT THAT THE REGULATORY

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:13.223
FEES THAT ARE COLLECTED

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.393
REASONABLY RELATE TO THE COST

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:18.562
FOR THE ACTIVITIES THAT THOSE.

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:21.197
FEES ARE SUPPORTING. AND WHAT

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:23.266
WE SAW WAS OVER THE FIVE YEARS

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:25.435
THAT IN TERMS OF THE LICENSING

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:26.803
EXPENDITURES IN THE LICENSING

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.539
REVENUE. THE REVENUE WASN'T

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:30.640
COVERING THE COST OF THE

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:33.910
EXPENDITURES I'M SORRY. WASN'T

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:35.245
COVERING THE COST OF THE

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:37.013
ACTIVITIES FOR THE LICENSING

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.015

ACTIVITIES WAS NINE POINT NINE

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:50.560
MILLION WHICH IS A GAP OF FIVE

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:53.129
POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS.

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:54.798
AND WE KIND OF SAW THE FLIP OF

00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:55.966
THAT FOR THE OTHER REGULATORY

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:57.801
FEES WHERE WERE THE REVENUE

00:53:57.867 --> 00:53:59.402

THOSE ANNUAL FEES PAID BY THE

00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:03.373
CARBON OWNERS AND THIRD PARTY

EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:10.580
WHILE THE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:13.416
WITH THOSE. ACTIVITIES WAS SIX

POINT NINE MILLION WHICH

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:28.198
THE OTHER REGULATORY FEES ARE

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:28.765
SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF THE

LICENSING ACTIVITIES. AND THIS

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:34.537
IS PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU USE

WHICH IS UNLAWFUL. ANOTHER

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:53.256
THING THAT THE LACK OF

00:54:53.323 --> 00:54:55.925
ALIGNMENT IN THE FEES ALSO

00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:57.794

FOURTEEN AT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:13.410
IT WAS ABOUT THIRTY MILLION

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:16.046
DOLLARS AND AT THE END OF

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:17.747
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT WAS UP TO

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.422
BACK TO THE GAMBLING CONTROL

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:28.124
FUND WHICH PROJECTS THAT THE

NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS.

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.865
WHEN WE LOOKED AT. KIND OF THE

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:37.333
REASONS WHY THE FUND WAS

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.601
GROWING SO MUCH ONE OF THE

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:39.703
THINGS THAT WE NOTED WAS

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.471
THERE'S BEEN NO RECENT ANALYSIS

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:43.907
AN UPDATE OF THE FEES. THE

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:46.643
COMMISSION DEVELOPS PUTS THE

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.211
FEES AND REGULATIONS AND THEY

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:50.346
HAVEN'T UPDATE THOSE FEES SENSE

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:51.581
MOST OF THE FEES SINCE TWO

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:53.883
THOUSAND EIGHT. AND SOME OTHER

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:56.419
REGULATORY FEES BACK TO TWO

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:57.020
THOUSAND FOUR IS THE LAST TIME

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:59.956
THEY BEEN UPDATED THE BUREAU

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:01.791
FOR ITS PART. THEY THEY

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:04.194
ACTUALLY ESTABLISH THE

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.895
BACKGROUND DEPOSIT FEES. AND

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:08.565
THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN EVALUATED

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:10.900
SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. SO

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.035
WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:14.871
THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:15.905
THAT THEY DO A THOROUGH COST

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:18.508
ANALYSIS. OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:20.343
SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.112
AND THEN ALIGN THE FEES WHAT

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:26.616
THE COST. SO THAT THE FEE

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:27.117
PAYERS ARE BEING FAIRLY

00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:29.319
CHARGED. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:32.021
NOTE IS THAT THAT NEEDS TO

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:34.190
OCCUR AFTER SOME OF THE OTHER

00:56:34.257 --> 00:56:36.092
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE OR

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:38.561
IMPLEMENTED IN TERMS OF.

SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.471
DEFICIENCIES THE BE SIGNED

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:49.339
THEIR PROCESSES AND THEY REALLY

00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:51.441
NEED TO DO THAT BEFORE THEY-

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:53.476
KIND OF UPDATE THEIR FEES SO

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:56.846
THAT THEY- ARE FAIR. WE ALSO

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:57.914
MADE A LEGISLATIVE

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.883

BACK TO UPDATE THEIR FEES. THAT

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.889
THEY REQUIRED THE COMMISSION

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:07.657
AND THE BUREAU TO UPDATE THE

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:09.359

THE GAMBLING GAMBLING CONTROL

00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:25.542
FUND HAS BEEN THAT IS ALLOW THE

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.210
BUREAU TO ENGAGE IN BILLING

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:28.778

YOUR HAND OUT. WE SHOW THERE

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:42.125
THE THREE BUCKETS OF TIME WE

LOOKEDAT THE LICENSING STAFF

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:45.528
AND HOW THEY WERE CHARGING

THEIR TIME AND THERE'S REALLY

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:48.631
THREE THREE BUCKETS THAT THEY

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:50.533
CHARGE THEIR TIME TO. FIRST THE

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.701
BILLABLE TIME IN THE NON

WITH THEIR CASE REVIEWS. AND

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:59.209
WHAT WHAT WE EXPECTED TO SEE

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:00.677
WAS THE NON BILLABLE TIME WOULD

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:02.745
BE A SMALL AMOUNT AND THE

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:04.280
BILLABLE TIME WOULD BE MORE OF

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:09.786
THEIR POLICIES REQUIRE THEM. TO

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:11.487
SORT OF WORK TOWARDS CHARGING

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:14.023
SIX HOURS A DAY TOWARDS THE

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.959
BILLABLE TIME. AND WHAT WE SAW

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:17.927
WAS AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ON THE

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:20.396
GRAPHIC IT'S 12% AND THESE ARE

00:58:20.463 --> 00:58:21.898
THE OF THE FEES THAT GO AGAINST

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.199
THE BACKGROUND OF POSITS AND

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:24.968
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO IF THERE'S

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:27.237
NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER THE

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:28.471
COST OF THE INVESTIGATION THEY

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:30.106
CAN GO BACK TO THE APPLICANT

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.075
REQUESTS MORE MONEY. AND

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:34.811
CONVERSELY IF THEY DON'T SPEND

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.512
IT ALL THEY HAVE TO REFUND IT

00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:40.617
TO THE- APPLICANT. IN THE NON

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:43.519
BILLABLE CATEGORY THOSE ARE FOR

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:45.688
TIME SPENT WORKING ON APPLICANT

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:48.057
BUT APPLICATION BUT NOT CHARGED

00:58:48.124 --> 00:58:49.425
THE APPLICANT IN THIS SHOULD BE

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:53.897
FOR. CASES WHAT THEY EXPLAINED

00:58:53.963 --> 00:58:54.397
TO US THAT WOULD BE IN A

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:55.131
SITUATION WHERE LET'S SAY THE

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:57.767
FILE WAS. NOT LOOKED OUT FOR A

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.302
FEW MONTHS AND THEY GO BACK TO

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:00.737
IT SO IT'S SORT OF. A LITTLE

00:59:00.803 --> 00:59:02.839
BIT INEFFICIENT NOT FAIR TO

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:06.576
THE- TO CHARGE THE. THE

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:08.278
APPLICANT AND SO THEY WOULD

00:59:08.344 --> 00:59:09.112
CHARGE NON BILLABLE SO WE

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:11.514
EXPECTED TO SEE SMALL AMOUNTS.

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:12.916
BUT WHEN WE DID OUR ANALYSIS WE

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:15.485
LOOKED AT FORTY CASES. AND WE

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:17.820
SAW THAT IN TWENTY EIGHT OF

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:20.156
THOSE CASES AT LEAST 25% OF THE

00:59:20.223 --> 00:59:21.991
TIME CHARGE TO THE CASE WAS NON%

00:59:22.058 --> 00:59:23.459
BILLABLE. IN NINETEEN

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:25.662
APPLICATIONS THE NON BILLABLE

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:28.131
TIME EXCEEDED THE BILLABLE.

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:30.433
NUMBER OF HOURS AND IN FIFTEEN

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.436
OF THOSE APPLICATIONS 75% OF

00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:34.070
THE TOTAL OUT TOTAL HOURS BUILD

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:36.639
WAS NON BILLABLE AND SO WE

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:39.575
LOOKED AT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:40.843
WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH NON

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.345
BILLABLE TIME AND WHAT WE SAW

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.547
WAS THE CATEGORIES THAT THEY-

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:46.416
WERE USING FOR THE BILLABLE NON

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:47.884
BILLABLE WERE PRIMARILY THE

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:50.019
SAME ALMOST EVERY CATEGORY WAS

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:51.387
THE SAME SO THERE WASN'T GOOD

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:52.522
GUIDANCE ON WHEN TO CHARGE

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:54.257
BILLABLE AND ONE TO NON START.

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:56.492
TO NOT TO CHARGE NON BILLABLE

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:59.095
AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED BY THE

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:02.031
LARGE VOLUME OF NON BILLABLE

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:05.301
TIME ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT.

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.202
SOME OF THE APPLICANTS WHEN WE

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:07.737
LOOKED AT THE FORTY CASES WERE

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.138
BEING CHARGED THE FULL AMOUNT

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.306
AND SOME WERE NOT AND SO THIS

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:13.443
KIND OF CREATES A- DISPARITY

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:14.010
AMONG THE LICENSE APPLICANTS

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:17.013
AND A SENSE OF UNFAIRNESS. AND

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.781
THEN THE LAST CATEGORIES THE

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.017
NON CASE TIME WHICH IT REP

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:24.587

LICENSING STAFF TIME AND THAT

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:27.890
WAS CONCERNING GIVEN THE HIGH

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:30.259
NUMBER OF BACKLOG OF LICENSE

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:30.827

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:46.302
AS THE STATE AUDITOR ALLUDED TO

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.403
IN HER INITIAL REMARKS THE

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.705
BUREAU GAMBLING CONTROL HAS ONE

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:50.306
HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS GENERALLY

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.208
SPEAKING TO PROCESS AN

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:53.643
APPLICATION TO A BACKGROUND

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.878
CHECK. AND FORWARD THAT

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.046
APPLICATION ON TO THE GAMBLING

01:01:57.113 --> 01:01:57.947
COMMISSION WITH THE

01:01:58.014 --> 01:01:59.715
RECOMMENDATION OF THE GAMING

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.350
COMMISSION EITHER APPROVE OR

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:04.087
DENY THAT APPLICATION. FOR A

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:04.587
LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:05.688
BACKGROUND I'LL BE ALLUDING TO

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:06.255
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LICENSE

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.990
APPLICATIONS AS WE GO THROUGH

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:08.858
WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:11.027
DISTINCTION BETWEEN CARTER AND

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:11.661
BUSINESSES IN THE THIRD PARTIES

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:14.030
THAT WORK IN THOSE CARTOONS.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.064
BUT IT IN EACH GROUP THERE ARE

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.399
ALSO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.101
RESPONSIBILITY THAT HAVE

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.836
IMPLICATIONS AND REGULATIONS IN

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:20.736
POLICY FOR HOW THOSE

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:21.904
APPLICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED AN

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:24.140
TREATED. GENERALLY SPEAKING

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.908
THERE'S A LOWEST STAFF LEVEL OF

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:28.411
LICENSE HOLDER LICENSE HOLDER

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.679
AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL THAT IS

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:31.214
GENERALLY A SUPERVISOR FOR LACK

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.049
OF BETTER TERM AND THEN. THE

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:33.850
HIGHEST LEVEL BEING THE

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.685
LICENCES HELD BY ACTUAL

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:36.719
BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEIR

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.721
DIFFERENT RULES IN

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:39.355
CONSIDERATION FOR EACH OF THOSE

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:43.326
I'LL GET INTO. WHEN WE-

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:44.227
REVIEWED THE BUREAU GAMING AT

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:44.827
ALL THE DATA WITH RESPECT TO

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:45.294
THE TIMELINESS OF ITS

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:46.596
PROCESSING OF BACKGROUND

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:47.663
INVESTIGATIONS FOR LICENSE

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.532
APPLICANTS. WE FOUND THAT IN

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.234
THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES IT

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.869
WAS EXCEEDING THE ONE HUNDRED

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:53.936
EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME AND IN

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:55.571
SOME CASES BY. A REALLY

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.006
SIGNIFICANT MARGIN IF YOU

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.842
WOULD. PLEASE TURN TO PAGE FOUR

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.277
WE HAVE A TABLE THAT WE

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:02.712
DEVELOPED BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:05.648
OF THAT DATA. GOING BACK THE

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:06.249
LAST FIVE YEARS AT THE TIME OF

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:08.818
OUR REVIEW. AND THERE'S A LOT

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.520
OF NUMBERS THERE SO I APOLOGIZE

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:11.354
FOR THAT BUT THE TAKE AWAY IS

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.456
KIND OF TWO FOLD. FIRST IS THAT

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.757
THE RED SUBTOTAL LINE AT THE

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.325
BOTTOM THERE SHOWS THAT OUT OF

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:18.027
THE FIVE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:19.028
THAT A COMPLETED DURING THIS

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:20.530
PERIOD OF TIME THAT WERE

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:21.664
SUBJECT TO THIS TIME

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:23.466
REQUIREMENTS. THIRTY FIVE

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:26.002
HUNDRED ABOUT 70% EXCEEDED THE

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:26.903
STATUTORY TIME FRAME FOR

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.638
PROCESSING THEM. THE SECOND

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:30.006
THING THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:31.107
FOR YOU IS THAT THERE

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:31.908
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:32.975
APPLICATIONS THAT TOOK MULTIPLE

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.545
YEARS FOR THE BUREAU TO

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.847
PROCESS. AND MOVE ALONG TO THE

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.949
GAMBLING COMMISSION FOR ACTUAL

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:43.886
AT. ACTION ON THOSE LICENSES.

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:44.387
AND THAT HAS A COUPLE OF

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:44.987
IMPLICATIONS DEPENDING ON THE

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.689
LICENSE TYPE. AS A GENERAL RULE

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:47.757
APPLICANTS ARE ALLOWED TO WORK

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:49.592
UNDER TEMPORARY STATUS WHILE

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.394
THEIR APPLICATION IS PENDING

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.462
AND THAT'S USUALLY. A SET TIME

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.031
FRAME THAT'S CONSIDERABLY LESS

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.265
THAN SOME OF THESE WAIT PERIOD

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:57.099
BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO KIND OF

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:59.202
PERPETUALLY RENEW THOSE

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.436
TEMPORARY LICENSES UNTIL SUCH

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.805
TIME AS A DECISION IS MADE. SO

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:04.440
IT BY AND LARGE APPLICANTS ARE

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.042
ABLE TO GO OUT TO WORK ON

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:06.976
THAT'S A BENEFIT TO THEM

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:08.110
FINANCIALLY DURING THIS PERIOD

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:09.645
OF TIME WITH THE COULD BE

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:12.215
SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. HOWEVER

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:14.250
OBVIOUSLY A HUGE PART PART OF

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.251
THE REASON FOR THIS EXTENSIVE

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.652
BACKGROUND PROCESSES TO ENSURE

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.354
THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.689
PROPERLY VETTED AND THAT THEY

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:22.491
ARE SUITABLE FOR WORK IN THE

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:24.327
INDUSTRY SO LONG WAITS WHERE

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.528
FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:26.829
FULLY REVIEWED ARE ACTIVE WE

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.097
WERE PARTICIPATING IN SHE DOES.

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:31.734
CREATE A RISK TO THE PUBLIC AND

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:32.335
TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS EMPLOY

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:35.871
THEM. THE OTHER THING I WOULD

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:36.672
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WHEN IT COMES

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:37.907
TO CARDROOM OWNERS IN

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.842
PARTICULAR. TEMPORARY LICENSES

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:40.943
ARE NOT. REALLY A FAN SO THE

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:43.613
TEMP CARBON Là CARDROOM OWNER

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:46.616
APPLICANTS ARE USUALLY. HAVE

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:47.483
APPLICATIONS ARE ASSOCIATE WITH

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.919
AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A CHOIR

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:51.120
TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF A

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:54.323
BUSINESS THOSE LICENSES CANNOT

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.191
BE ACTED UPON ON A TEMPORARY

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:57.159
BASIS OF THOSE CONTRACTS IN

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.160
THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE TO

01:04:58.227 --> 01:04:59.295
GENERALLY WAIT UNTIL SUCH TIME

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.830
AS- THE BUREAU HAS FINISHED ITS

01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:01.797
WORK ON THE COMMISSION IS MADE

01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:03.899
A DECISION SO. THERE'S A REAL

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.368
RISK TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:06.869
BUSINESS INTERESTS FROM THESE

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:09.171
DELAYS AND I WE'LL GET IN TO

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:12.041
SOME SPECIFIC REVIEW OF THOSE

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:12.642
OF THOSE OF THOSE TIME FRAMES

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:19.248
SHORTLY. IN TERMS OF WHY. WE

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:19.849
YOU KNOW SOME OF ITS THEN THE

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:20.616
CAUSES WE SAW FOR SOME OF THESE

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:22.118
DELAYS. WHEN A WHEN A LICENSE

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:22.818
APPLICATION COMES INTO THE

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:24.320
BUREAU AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:26.689
YOU WENT TO A AN INTAKE UNIT.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:27.657
AS IS POSSIBLE FOR COLLECTING

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:30.159
ALL OF THESE. APPLICATIONS AND

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:31.160
ASSOCIATED BACKGROUND MATERIALS

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:32.995
PROVIDED BY APPLICANTS. AT THE

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:34.497
TIME OF OUR AUDIT THAT IN

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:35.631
TAKING IT DID NOT HAVE ANY

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:37.199
FUNCTION FOR ASSESSING THE

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:38.534
COMPLETENESS OF THE INFORMATION

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.936
IN THOSE. IN THOSE APPLICATION

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:42.171
PACKAGES THEY WOULD FINALLY

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.806
JUST TAKE IT. COLLATED

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:44.840
POTENTIALLY STANCE ON THE

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:45.608
DOCUMENTATIONS FOR ANIL AND

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.009
HOUSES AT A LATER DATE AND THEN

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:48.878
SHELVE IT PENDING ONE OF THE

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:53.783
LICENSING UNITS. PICKING IT UP

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:54.383
AND ASSIGNING IT TO STAFF FOR

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:58.821
REVIEW. TWO THINGS KIND OF CAME

01:05:58.888 --> 01:05:59.889
INTO PLAY THERE. ONE THEY WERE

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:00.890
NOT SET BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:02.024
ASSESSING THE COMPLETENESS.

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:02.658
THEY WERE NOT GETTING BACK TO

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:03.292
APPLICANTS IN A TIMELY FASHION

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:04.560
AS REQUIRED BY REGULATIONS IN

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:05.061
TERMS OF WHETHER THOSE

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.462
APPLICATIONS WERE COMPLETE OR

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:07.897
NOT. SO IN SOME CASES

01:06:07.963 --> 01:06:09.098
APPLICANTS FOR WAITING MONTHS

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:10.433
EVEN YEARS TO HEAR BACK FROM

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:12.435
WHETHER THEY'VE EVEN SUBMITTED

01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:13.035
THE APPLICATION MATERIALS THAT

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:15.171
WERE REQUIRED OF THEM. SECONDLY

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:16.305
BECAUSE IT TOOK SO LONG TO

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.807
ULTIMATELY ASSIGN SOME OF THOSE

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:18.307
APPLICATIONS TO WAITING

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:20.776
ANALYST'S ANALYTICAL STAFF. WE

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:22.545
FOUND INSTANCES WHERE THE

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:23.913
MATERIALS THAT THE APPLICANTS

01:06:23.979 --> 01:06:25.348
HAVE PROVIDED UP FRONT HAD KIND

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:26.182
OF AGE OUT OR WERE STILL FROM

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:27.450
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUREAU

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:28.651
AND SO THEY HAD IN BOTH OF

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:29.318
THOSE CASES THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:30.586
GO BACK TO APPLICANTS. AFTER

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.189
SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME AND

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.323
REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.958
A FOLLOW UP QUESTION SO THEY

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:36.826
REALLY CONTRIBUTED TO

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.728
INEFFICIENCIES AND CERTAINLY

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:40.463
WITHOUT FRUSTRATION ON THE PART

01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:41.163
OF THE APPLICANTS ABOUT THE

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.599
ENSUING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:44.433
THE BUREAU STAFF AND THE

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.001
APPLICANT IN TERMS OF REPEATED

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:47.236
REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.604
INFORMATION AT TIMES WE SAW

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.805
REQUESTS FROM THE BUREAU FOR

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:51.907
FOLLOW UP INFORMATION THAT WERE

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.442
YOU KNOW UP TO A YEAR APART SO

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.244
THAT. IS REPEATED BACK AND

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:55.911
FORTH AND REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:57.780
THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.716
LICENSES WERE ACTIVELY BEING

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:05.221
WORKED ON FOR MULTIPLE YEARS.

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:06.589
HOW ALSO NOTE THAT. THIS THE

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:07.256
LACK OF NOTICED APPLICANTS IS A

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:07.890
IS HAVE A COMMON THEME THAT WE

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:09.392
IDENTIFIED AS WELL. IN ADDITION

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:10.626
TO HAVING TO NOTIFY APPLICANTS

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.061
ABOUT THE INITIAL STATUS OF

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:13.028
THEIR APPLICATION IN

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:14.830
REGULATIONS. THE GAMMA CONTROL

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:16.532
ACT REQUIRES THAT THE BUREAU.

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:17.800
FOLLOW UP WITH APPLICANTS AT

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.435
THE EXPIRATION OF THE ONE

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:20.403
HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:21.804
IF THEY ARE NOT YET FINISHED

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.705
WITH THE APPLICATION TO.

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:23.906
PROVIDE AN ESTIMATED TIME OF

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.842
COMPLETION. WE SAW THAT

TO ASSIGN DURING THAT SAME TIME

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:18.854
HERE BECAUSE THEY HAD

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:19.455
SUFFICIENT STAFF SO ALL THOSE

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:20.089
GAVE US SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:21.957
FAIRNESS AND EQUITY AND

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.025
CERTAINLY THE TRANSPARENCY OF

THE PROCESS THAT THE DOOR HAD

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:27.062
IN PLACE FOR PRIORITIZING AND

GETTING THROUGH THOSE LEGAL

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.965

ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE OWNER

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.545
APPLICATIONS AND WE FOUND

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.113
ADDITIONAL PROCEDURAL ISSUES

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.481
WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP IN SO

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:47.449

THE PRIORITIES WERE TO SET TIME

01:09:58.093 --> 01:10:00.229
FRAMES FOR THEM TO FOLLOW BUT

01:10:00.296 --> 01:10:01.597
WE THOUGHT WE SAW VERY KIND OF

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:02.831
INFREQUENT IN ONLY INFORMAL

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:04.199

CONNECTING Y. DECISION WAS MADE

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:14.403
BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.839

PART OF THIS GRAPHIC CONSIST

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:05.087
CONCERNS IT'S BASICALLY

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.055
INCOMING AND OUTGOING

MODESTLY I WAS BUT A 5% OVER

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:27.876
THE PERIOD OF TIME. SO THAT'S

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:28.777
THAT'S A FACTOR BUT IT'S NOT A

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.446
DRIVING FACTOR IN TERMS OF THE

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:39.681
IMPACTED THE EFFICIENCY IN THE

01:13:39.748 --> 01:13:40.916
PARK IF ANY OF THE LICENSING

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:41.483
ACTIVITIES AT THE BUREAU WE

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.385
TOOK A LOOK AT ON AVERAGE THE

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:44.253
NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT.

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:45.754
THE GIVEN STAFF MEMBER FILLED

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:46.789
STAFF POSITION WAS ABLE TO

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:48.924
PROCESS IN A GIVEN YEAR. AND

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:49.925
WHAT DISTURBED US ABOUT THAT

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:51.727
ANNOUNCES WHAT IT SHOWED THAT.

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:53.562
THAT HAS BEEN A STEEP DECLINE

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:55.831
SINCE THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:58.333
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AS THE

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.169
GRAPHIC SHOWS IN TWENTY

01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:00.803
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ALTHOUGH THEY

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:02.137
HAD ONLY TWENTY FIVE FILL

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:03.105
LICENSING POSITIONS EACH OF

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.373
THOSE POSITIONS WAS ABLE TO

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:06.008
PROCESS ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:07.476
FORTY SIX. BACKGROUND

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:08.076
INVESTIGATIONS SINCE AND SEND

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:11.380
THOSE ON. BY CONTRAST BY THE

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.714
TIME THEY GOT WE GET TO NINE

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:14.917
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. THERE WERE

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:15.884
FIFTY NINE LICENSING STOP EACH

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.386
OF PROCESSING LESS THAN HALF OF

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:19.288
THE PRODUCTIVITY AT THE

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:19.955
BEGINNING THAT TIME PERIOD ONLY

01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:20.823
SEVENTY APPLICATIONS ON

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:22.457
AVERAGE. SO THIS SET OFF

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:23.859
OBVIOUS THE ALARM BELLS FOR US

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:25.928
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT

01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:27.663
ACCOUNTED FOR THIS THIS

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.364
DECREASE IN IN PRODUCTIVITY AND

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:30.699
HOW COULD BE ADDRESSED.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:32.401
UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:33.602
EXPLANATION SHE GOT IN THE DATA

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:35.070
THAT THE BUREAU HAS MAKE IT

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.639
CHALLENGING TO ASSESS WHAT THE

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:38.240
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF STAFFING

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.876
IS AT THE BUREAU GOING FORWARD.

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:43.679
ONE REASON FOR THAT. IS THAT

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:44.847
THE BUREAU HAS INFORMATION ON

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:47.316
HOW LONG IT TAKES. ON AVERAGE

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:48.183
TO PROCESS THESE APPLICATIONS

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.051
BUT IT HASN'T UPDATED THE

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:51.520
MAJORITY. OF THAT INFORMATION

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:54.089
FOR SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUALLY

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.057
PRIOR TO THE TIME WHEN ADDED

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:55.891
THESE POSITIONS SO IF THERE'S

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.026
ANY SORT OF. DIMINISHING

01:14:58.093 --> 01:14:59.862
RETURNS ON ADDITIONAL POSITIONS

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:00.495
WERE CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT THERE

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:01.363
ARE THAT WOULD BE KIND OF FOR

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.265
THAT FLIGHT DATA. IN FACT FOR

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.666
THE POSITIONS THAT ARE THE

01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:05.634
TYPES OF LICENSES THAT HAS

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:07.870
UPDATED THAT DATA. THAT SHOW

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:08.804
THAT THERE BEEN SIGNIFICANT

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:10.239
CREATE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.573
THE NUMBER OF HOURS IT TAKES

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.208
PER WHICH CERTAINLY GIANTS WITH

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:15.644
WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE DID OUR

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:21.516
OWN. ANALYSIS. ADDITIONALLY WE

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.117
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.419
THAT THE BUREAU DOES NOT HAVE A

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.455
FORMAL PROTOCOL FOR WHICH

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:27.623
PORTIONS OF ITS BACKLOG IS

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:29.091
GOING TO TARGET AT WHAT TIMES

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:30.792
AND IN WHAT NUMBERS INSTEAD

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.694
WHEN WE ASKED MANAGEMENT AT THE

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:34.663
BUREAU ABOUT THIS TREND THEY

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:35.998
ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THEY

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:37.833
MIGHT WELL BE FOCUSING THEIR

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:38.967
ATTENTION ON DIFFERENT TYPES

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.002
ARE DIFFERENT COMPOSITIONS OF

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:41.470
APPLICATIONS YEAR IN AND YEAR

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:42.537
OUT SOME OF WHICH ARE MORE

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:44.506
COMPLEX THAN OTHERS AND THAT

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:45.641
MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGES

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:48.210
IN PRODUCTIVITY HOWEVER WE LOOK

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.077
AT THE DATA IN TERMS OF THE

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.512
ACTUAL NUMBERS COMING OUT OF IT

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:51.880
DIDN'T DIDN'T CONSISTENTLY BEAR

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:53.282
OUT THAT THESIS. FOR EXAMPLE

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:55.684
THE BUREAU STRESSED TO US THAT

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:57.319
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEY

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:58.654
TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.122
MORE TIME CONSUMING AND COMPLEX

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:04.559
THIRD PARTY OWNER APPLICATIONS.

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:05.193
AND THAT THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:05.761
DECREASE IN SOME OTHER OTHER

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:09.865
PRODUKTIVNOSTI. ANY THIRD PARTY

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:10.599
OR APPLICATIONS DURING THAT

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.801
PERIOD OF TIME IN TWENTY

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:13.835
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SIMILARLY WE

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:14.569
SOUTH FLUCTUATIONS IN THE

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:17.272
CARBON APPLICATIONS THAT WERE

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:19.274
NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE THAT

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.877
SO THAT THE COMPLEXITY OF THOSE

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:23.946
AND ULTIMATELY A MANAGER FOR

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:25.080
THAT UNIT TOLD US THAT SHE

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:25.681
COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHY THERE WAS

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.249
THE FLUCTUATION THAT WE WERE

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:28.517
SEEING SO WE MADE

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:31.053
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE BUREAU

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:32.821
DEVELOP A FORMAL POLICY OUR

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.589
FIRM FORMAL PLANNED BY NOVEMBER

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.258
OF THIS YEAR FOR COMPLETING

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:37.726
REMAINING BACKLOG APPLICATION

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.394
TO EXPECT THAT PLAN TO BE VERY

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.763
PRECISE ABOUT WHEN IT. WHEN IT

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:42.965
EXPECTS TO CLEAR WHICH BACK

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.933
WHICH BACKLOG APPLICATIONS WHEN

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.935
TO GET TO THAT NUMBER OF ZERO

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:48.236
AS PART OF THAT PROCESS WE MADE

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:48.904
A RECOMMENDATION THE

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:50.572
LEGISLATURE THAT IT EXTEND

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:51.807
TEMPORARY CURRENT TEMPORARY

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.809
FUNDING FOR THOSE POSITIONS FOR

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:54.743
TWO YEARS RATHER THAN MAKE THEM

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.311
PERMANENT BECAUSE AS AS

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:58.714
HOPEFULLY HAVE MADE CLEAR WE IT

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.514
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BEER

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:01.283
HAS ESTABLISH WHAT OF WHAT A

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:02.617
PERMANENT APPROPRIATE STAFFING

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:04.720
OF ALL IS FOR ALL THESE THE

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:05.253
MANAGEMENT AND EFFICIENCY

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.755
SHORTCOMINGS WITHIN A FIVE AND

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.490
THE LEGISLATURE ACTED UPON THE

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.192
RECOMMENDATION HAS EXTEND THAT

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:12.027
FUNDING SO OUR HOPE IS THAT THE

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:12.461
BUREAU WILL TAKE THE

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:13.996
INTERVENING TIME CLEAR ITS

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.765
BACKLOG DELIBERATELY AND THEN

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:17.599
ESTABLISH. GOOD POLICY CAN AND

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:24.840
PRODUCT. THAT WILL HELP IT.

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:25.307
STRAIGHT TO YOU WHAT A

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:35.384
PERMANENT STAFFING LEVEL WITH.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.352
THAT WHICH MEANT. AND DUE TO

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.788
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT OUR- PAST

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:40.322
INTERPRETATIONS OF LAW AND

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:43.492
REGULATIONS TO BUREAU. SEVERAL

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:46.361
YEARS AGO PUT A MORATORIUM ON

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:48.030
UP I'M PROCESSING NEW GAMES

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.931
APPLICATIONS AND WHAT THAT HAS

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:50.799
CREATED AS A KIND OF A

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:53.468
BIFURCATED SYSTEM WHERE CERTAIN

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:55.570
CERTAIN KARDAM ESTABLISHMENTS

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:56.438
ARE ABLE TO OFFER GAMES THAT

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.607
OTHERS CANNOT. BECAUSE OF THE

01:17:58.673 --> 01:17:59.908
TIMING OF THAT APPLICATION AND

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:03.345
SO WE'VE BEEN. KIND OF YOU'RE

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:04.112
DOING THE PROCESS OF OUR AUDIT

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:06.014
IN SANSKRIT URGING THE Và

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.349
BUREAU TO TAKE ACTION TO DECIDE

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.051
ON A COURSE OF ACTION FOR

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:09.918
PROCESSING ALL THIS PAINTING

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:12.554
GAMES APPLICATIONS. AS OF SIXTY

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:14.456
DAYS THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO. SO

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.124
WE WILL STILL BE A MONITORING

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.427
THAT THAT FAIRNESS CONCERN THAT

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.662
WE THAT WE DEVELOPED. TURNING

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:21.630
TO THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF

01:18:21.696 --> 01:18:22.798
THE TIME FRAMES IN THE

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:24.066
TIMELINESS OF THEIR APP OF

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:26.201
APPLICATION PROCESS. I'LL START

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:27.269
OFF BY SAYING THAT AT THE TIME

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.603
OF OUR REVIEW THE COMMISSION

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:30.472
DID NOT MAINTAIN COMPREHENSIVE

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.607
DATA ON ITS- WORKLOAD. THAT

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:34.342
WOULD ALLOW US TO DO ANY SORT

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:35.377
OF SIMILAR ANALYSIS THAT WE

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:38.280
PERFORMED AT THE BUREAU. SO WE

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:39.147
DON'T HAVE ANY FINDINGS THAT

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.248
AREA WE DID MAKE A

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:41.516
RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY HAVE A

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.985
BUSINESS NEED TO DO SO. AND AT

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.487
SIXTY DAYS THEY DID DEMONSTRATE

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.321
TO US THAT THEY HAVE PUT A

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.356
POLICY IN PLACE TO. ENTER THAT

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:49.524
INFORMATION AN EXISTING

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:51.460
DATABASE. GOING FORWARD AND

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:52.727
ALSO PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:54.129
DIRECTED STAFF GOING BACK AT

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:56.465
LEAST SEVERAL YEARS IN ARREARS

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:57.032
TO ENTER PASSED DATA SO OUR

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:59.067
HOPE IS THAT. IF THAT CONTINUES

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:00.602
IN THE SUCCESSFUL THERE WILL BE

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.871
MORE ROBUST INFORMATION ON. THE

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:04.606
OVERALL TIME LINES AND

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:05.240
PRODUCTIVITY ASSOCIATE WITH THE

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:07.476
COMMISSION'S ACTIVITIES. WHAT I

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:09.778
CAN SAY WE DID REVIEW EIGHTEEN

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:11.213
APPLICATIONS ON A CASE BY CASE

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:14.116
DETAIL BASIS FOR THE TIME FRAME

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.383
THAT THEY THEY TOOK IN GOING

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:15.984
THROUGH THE COULD BE GAMBLING

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:18.553
CONTROL COMMISSION. THERE IS A

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.454
HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY TIME

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:22.057
FRAME FOR THE- COMMISSION TO

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:23.725
APPROVE OR DENY AN APPLICATION

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.193
WITH THAT COMES THROUGH FROM

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.094
THE BUREAU WITH THE

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:27.162
RECOMMENDATION ASSOCIATED WITH

01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:29.464
IT. WE FOUND THAT IN CASES

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.433
WHERE THE COMMISSION APPROVED A

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.268
LICENSE APPLICANT IT MEANT THAT

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.103
TIME FROM VERY EASILY IN FACT

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:37.639
THAT AN AVERAGE OF JUST TWO.

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:38.707
LESS THAN UNDER UNDER THIRTY

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:40.642
DAYS GENERALLY SPEAKING.

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.210
HOWEVER IN INSTANCES WHERE THE

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:43.478
BUREAU OCT OR THE EXCUSE ME THE

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.046
COMMISSION ABSOLUTELY OPTED TO

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:46.681
DENY RECOMMENDATION WE FOUND

APPLICANTS OR HOW IT SUBJECTS

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:06.928
APPLICANTS TO LEVELS OF

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.697
SCRUTINY WHILE REVIEWING THEM.

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.533
WE FOUND THAT THEY HAD

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:12.233
PROCEDURES THAT WERE

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.269
INCONSISTENT FROM TYPE TO TYPE.

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.837
DECENTRALIZED AMONG ITS VARIOUS

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:17.472
UNITS AND WE'RE NOT ALWAYS

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:18.106
COMMENSURATE WITH THE LEVEL OF

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:20.008
RESPONSIBILITY THAT THOSE.

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:21.409
LICENSE HOLDERS WERE EXPECTED

01:26:21.476 --> 01:26:22.911
TO HAVE IN THE INDUSTRY.

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.178
POTENTIALLY BECAUSE OF THAT WE

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:26.247
SAW SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN THE

01:26:26.314 --> 01:26:27.482
LEVEL OF SCRUTINY OR TYPES OF

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:28.917
QUESTIONS THAT APPLICANTS WERE

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:30.919
ASKED. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS WE

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:33.855
FOUND ONE APPLICANT WHO. A

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:34.923
NUMBER OF APPLICANTS WHO WERE

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:37.458
CHASTISED BY THE BUREAU IN

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:38.059

WORKING IN AND A CARD ROOM.

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:46.301
LONGER THAN THE ALLOWED PRE

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:47.035
BEFORE FILING A FORMAL

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:49.304
APPLICATION. ARE WE SAW ANOTHER

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:50.171
INSTANCE IN WHICH A AN

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:52.173
INDIVIDUAL FILED AN APPLICATION

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.608
THAT STATED VERY CLEARLY THAT

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:54.175
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING IN A

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:55.777
CARBON FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. AND

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:57.645
I'M LICENSED CAPACITY AND HAVE

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.147
BEEN DOING SO WELL UNDER THE

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:02.116

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:03.151
EITHER THAT WAS NOT CAUGHT WAS

01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:04.385
NOT REMARKED UPON FOR OTHER

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:05.987
REASONS BY THE BUREAU AND THAT

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:07.989
INDIVIDUAL WAS BATES BASICALLY

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.324
MOVED VERY CLEANLY THROUGH THE

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:11.559
LICENSING PROCESS. IN THE CASES

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:13.127

THE FORMER GROUP I TALKED

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:16.631
ABOUT. WHO FOR WHOM THAT THE

BUREAU HIGHLIGHTED DELAYED

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:19.601
APPLICATION. THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:21.102
APPLICATIONS ULTIMATELY DENIED

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:22.637
BUT AS I WE TO BEFORE THERE ARE

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:24.505
OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED IN THERE

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:26.040
SO WE CAN ATTRIBUTE THE DENIAL

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:27.642
TO THAT. TO THAT THAT

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:29.811
DISCREPANCY HOWEVER AS I

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:33.214
STATED. WITHOUT THIS IS AN AREA

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:33.681
WHERE THERE'S A STRICT

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:36.784
MATHEMATICAL. FORMULA THAT THAT

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:37.285
THE THAT THE COMMISSION

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:37.685
FOLLOWED REGION'S

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:44.359
DETERMINATIONS AND SO. EVERY

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:44.859
PIECE OF IT NEEDS TO BE

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:45.426
CONSISTENT AND FAIR FROM OUR

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:49.864
PERSPECTIVE. FINALLY WE

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:50.465
IDENTIFIED A PROCEDURAL ISSUE

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:51.032
AT THE COMMISSION WELL WITH

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:51.499
RESPECT TO ALLOWING.

OF THE PROCESS. ALREADY

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:54.502
EXPLAINED THAT THE THAT STATE

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:57.205
LAW AND REGULATIONS MAKE. THE

01:27:57.271 --> 01:27:58.339
HOLDING OF AN EVIDENTIARY

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:59.574
HEARING MANDATORY FOR CASES OF

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:01.809
DENIAL. HOWEVER WE IDENTIFIED

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:03.645
INDIVIDUALS WHO WHILE AWAITING

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.546
THEIR EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS.

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:06.714
STATE VERY CLEARLY TO

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:07.949
COMMISSION STAFF THAT THEY NO

01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:09.017
LONGER WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:10.618
THE PROCESS SOMETIMES. BE IT

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:12.720
VIA EMAIL ONE INDIVIDUAL

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:14.389
EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD CONSULTED

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:15.556
WITH HIS ATTORNEYS AND BELIEVE

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:16.624
THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE. AND

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:18.626
DIDN'T WANT TO PROCEED ANOTHER

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:20.194
INDICATED THAT THE CARD ON THE

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:21.362
AT WORK AND HAD BURNED DOWN AND

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:22.964
THEY LEFT THE INDUSTRY. SO WE

01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:24.132
ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUR

01:28:24.198 --> 01:28:25.667
FAIRLY CLEARLY EXPRESSING A

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:27.435
LACK OF INTENT TO PURSUE

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:28.936
LICENSURE IN THE FUTURE.

01:28:29.003 --> 01:28:30.872
HOWEVER THE BEER AT THE

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:31.906
COMMISSION WHEN A HAND HELD

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:32.940
EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS IN THOSE

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:34.409
INSTANCES IN THIS PART OF THAT

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:35.443
OPENED UP THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.712
RECORD AND HAD. ATTORNEYS

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:38.746
SUBMIT EVIDENCE AGAINST THOSE

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:40.782
APPLICANTS SUITABILITY. SOME OF

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:42.316
WHICH WAS THEN PUBLISHED IN THE

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:43.618
IN THE PUBLIC DECISION THE

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:44.852
COMMISSION'S WEBSITE. WHEN WE

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:46.921
ASKED ABOUT THAT PROCESS THE

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:48.156
COMMISSION YOU KNOW JUST

01:28:48.222 --> 01:28:50.024
RIGHTFULLY. EMPHASIZE THE DUE

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:51.759
PROCESS RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.194
TO A HEARING AND THAT THEY DID

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:54.796
NOT WANT TO. DENY ANYBODY OF

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:56.497
THOSE RIGHTS. HOWEVER WE ALSO

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:57.832
DETERMINE THAT THEY DID NOT

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:00.468
HAVE A FORMAL PROTOCOL FOR

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:01.335
INFORMING APPLICANTS ABOUT HOW

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.171
TO WITHDRAW FROM THAT PROCESS.

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:04.872
THEY TOLD US THAT THEY REQUIRED

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:06.340
FORMAL WRITTEN WITHDRAWAL FROM

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:07.508
APPLICANTS BUT THERE WAS NO

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:08.609
WEAPONS AT THAT HAVE BEEN

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:09.143
PROVIDED AND THERE ARE NO

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.778
INTERNAL PROTOCOLS TO STAFF.

01:29:10.845 --> 01:29:12.447
HOW DO AND SHRUGGED INDIVIDUALS

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:14.449
TO DO SO. WHICH WE BELIEVE

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:15.750
COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:16.651
SITUATIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:17.752
MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THEY NO

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:19.587
LONGER WANT OUR PARTICIPATE.

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:20.488
BUT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO THE

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:23.157
END OF THE PROCESS. ANYWAY AT

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:24.525
SIXTY DAYS THE COMMISSION DID

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:27.995
PROVIDE NEW VERY COMPREHENSIVE

01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:30.531
POLICIES GUIDING STAFF ON THIS

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:32.333
PROTOCOL AND SO. I'M FROM THEIR

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.235
SIDE OF THINGS WE BELIEVE THAT

01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:35.670
THE ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.472
HOWEVER THERE IS STILL THIS ON

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.006
GOING ENGINE WITH THE GAMBLING

01:29:39.073 --> 01:29:45.012
CONTROL ACT. SO TO ENSURE THAT

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:51.953
IT. THAT THAT. PEOPLE ARE THAT

01:29:52.019 --> 01:29:52.887
PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING THE OF THE

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:53.454
HEARINGS THAT THEY WANT IF

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:54.622
THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. IN A FAIR

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:55.156
AND CONSISTENT WAY WITHOUT

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.324
CONFLICT WITH STATUTE WE- CAN

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:57.692
REITERATE OUR A RECOMMENDATION

01:29:57.759 --> 01:29:58.292
TO THE LEGISLATURE TO REVISIT

01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:00.194
THAT STATUTORY LANGUAGE FINALLY

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:01.329
I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW AREAS

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:03.297
THAT WE LOOKED AT. THAT ARE ARE

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:03.765
NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:04.298
LICENSING PROCESS TO HAVE

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:05.099
RELEVANCE AND I CAN TELL YOU

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:05.633
WHAT WE WERE AND WE'RE NOT

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.768
ABLE. TO DETERMINE SOME OF

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:08.603
THOSE AREAS ONE QUESTION WE

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:09.470
WERE ASKED BY THE JOINT

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.139
LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE WAS

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:12.473
ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE HOW

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.008
MUCH TIME ENFORCEMENT AGENTS AT

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:16.010
THE BUREAU SPEND IN VARIOUS.

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.378
ESTABLISHMENT AS PART OF THEIR

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:19.147
INVESTIGATION AND SOMETIMES

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:20.081
UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATION

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:21.716
DUTIES. UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:30:21.783 --> 01:30:23.951
BUREAU DOES NOT CURRENTLY

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.153
TRACKED THAT INFORMATION IN ANY

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:27.522
CENTRALIZED AWAY. YOU WOULD

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:28.956
HAVE TO GO INTO EVEN INDIVIDUAL

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:30.057
CASE FILES EVEN WHEN WE DID

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:32.560
THAT IN THEIR SYSTEM. THE CARD

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:34.028
ROOM IN QUESTION WASN'T ALWAYS

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:34.595
THAT WE NEEDED TO THERE IS

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:36.063
REALLY NO SYSTEMATIC WAY FOR US

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:37.899
TO DETERMINE WHETHER IN THE

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:39.934
DISTRIBUTION OF TIME BUT AGENTS

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:41.202
WERE STANDING AT VARIOUS

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:42.036
ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGHOUT THE

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.571
STATE. TO GET TO THE CENTER

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:44.639
THERE'S ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE%

01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:46.908
EQUITY OF THAT OR OR TARGETING

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.242
OF PLACES WE MADE A

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:49.377
RECOMMENDATION TO THE BUREAU

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:50.144
THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:51.646
BUSINESS NEED TO BE COLLECTING

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:52.547
THAT DATA SO THAT THEY KNOW HOW

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:53.247
THE RESOURCES ARE BEING

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:54.715
UTILIZED IN THAT. YOU KNOW THAT

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:59.220
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. THE

01:30:59.287 --> 01:30:59.787
OVERSIGHT GROUP SUCH AS OUR

01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:03.858
SELF TO REVIEW. WE ALSO FOUND

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:04.826
ONE ISSUE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

01:31:04.892 --> 01:31:05.393
IDENTIFY AND THE ENFORCEMENT

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:06.561
SIDE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.629
FUNDING THAT PAYS FOR VARIOUS

01:31:08.696 --> 01:31:10.198
POSITIONS IN THE BUREAU OF

01:31:10.264 --> 01:31:12.233
GAMBLING CONTROL AS YOU MAY

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.702
KNOW THE GIRL CAMPAIGN TO ALSO

01:31:14.769 --> 01:31:16.871
HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRIBAL

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:18.773
GAMING OVERSIGHT TO A CERTAIN

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.474
EXTENT AND AS SUCH THEY ARE

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:21.776
ALSO FUNDED OUT OF THE SPECIAL

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:22.743
DISTRIBUTION FUNDED JUST PAID

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:25.613
INTO BY THOSE CASINOS THEY HAVE

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.148
POSITIONS THAT ARE SLATED TO BE

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:28.716
FUNDED BY ONE OF TWO FUNDS

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:30.084
WHICH MAKES SENSE AND IT ALSO

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:31.352
MADE SENSE TO US WHEN WE FOUND

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:32.753
THAT THOSE POSITION SOMETIMES

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.322
WORKED ON ISSUES THAT WERE ON

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:35.590
THE OTHER SIDE IN TERMS OF

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:38.559
CARDROOM VERSES. VERSUS TRIBAL

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:40.428
CASINO INVESTIGATIONS BASED ON

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:41.963
NEED HOWEVER WHAT WASN'T

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:43.531
HAPPENING WAS ANY SORT OF

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:45.700
RECONCILIATION WHERE IF AND IF

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:47.168
AN INDIVIDUAL WAS PAID FOR OUT

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:48.169
OF ONE FINE BUT WORKED IN THE

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:50.004
OTHER THAT THAT THAT SECOND

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:50.838
FUND IS MAKING THE FIRST FUND

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:53.140
HOLE FOR THE COST AND SO WE

RATHER THAN FOR A FEE WOULD YOU

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:50.904
CONSIDER THIS. TO BE A AN

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:51.672
EXAMPLE OF THE FAILURE TO MAKE

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:52.706
A SATISFACTORY NEXUS TEST

01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:54.174

WHO REQUESTED THE AUDIT. WHICH

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:46.193
IS THE ASSERTION THAT THE

BUREAU MAYBE TREATING

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:49.629

TREATED APPLICANTS AND FAIRLY

01:48:09.583 --> 01:48:11.184
BASED ON RECENT AT THIS AT THE

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.886
CITY. IT INDICATED THAT WASN'T

01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:15.088
ABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE THE

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:15.622

A FACTOR THAT WE CONSIDER IN

01:48:27.267 --> 01:48:29.035
THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS BUT

01:48:29.102 --> 01:48:30.070
ALSO BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY

01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:32.539
PROHIBITED FROM LAW. BY LAW

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:33.106
FROM REQUIRING THAT TYPE OF

BE COLLECTED ON A VOLUNTARY

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:39.813

SUCH CLAIMS. AS I PREVIOUSLY

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:55.128
INDICATED TO SOME MEMBERS.

01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:55.896
SHOULD I RECEIVE ANY SPECIFIC

01:48:55.962 --> 01:48:58.431
CLAIMS. I WOULD BE HAPPY

01:48:58.498 --> 01:48:59.499

SPECIFICS OF ANY FINDINGS. AND

01:49:06.139 --> 01:49:08.074
THE REASONS WHY WE MAY HAVE

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:09.175
RECOMMENDED APPROVAL OR DENIAL

01:49:09.242 --> 01:49:11.611
OF AN INDIVIDUAL. WITHOUT THAT

01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:14.147
WE ARE JUST LEFT WITH.

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:14.714
BASICALLY BASELESS CLAIMS TO

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:27.527
UNACCEPTABLE AND WOULD ADDRESS

01:50:42.535 --> 01:50:44.871
REVIEW WAS REQUIRED. THE BUREAU

01:50:44.938 --> 01:50:46.406
CONSIDERS THESE NINE HUNDRED

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:48.074
AND FORTY SIX CASES TO BE THE

01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:49.709
BACKLOG AND NOT THE TOTAL

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.011
NUMBER OF PENDING APPLICATIONS

01:50:51.077 --> 01:50:53.146
BEFORE US. IT'S IMPORTANT

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:54.214
BECAUSE WE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.882
TO GET TO ZERO BECAUSE EVERY

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:56.516
DAY WE CONTINUOUSLY RECEIVE NEW

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:59.486

HUNDRED NEW APPLICATIONS.

01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:04.657

01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:11.798
COMPLETE OUR REVIEW WITHIN THE

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:12.365
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY TIME

BACKLOG SO THE WE MEET THESE

01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:22.942
GOALS. AND WHILE WE WORK ON

01:51:23.009 --> 01:51:24.177
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:25.912
BACKLOGGED APPLICATIONS WE

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:26.913

THAT WE FOUND. THE AUDITOR

01:51:51.137 --> 01:51:52.205
RECOMMENDED THAT WE IDENTIFY

01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:54.074
DELAYS IN OUR BACKGROUND

REVIEWING OUR PROCESSES TO

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.714
DETERMINE WHERE CERTAIN DELAYS

01:52:01.781 --> 01:52:02.348
MAY EXIST IN THE WHAT WE CAN DO

01:52:02.415 --> 01:52:05.018
TO ADDRESS THEM. THIS MAY

01:52:05.085 --> 01:52:07.287
REQUIRE CHANGING PROCESSES AND

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:08.521
ELIMINATING SOME STEPS OUR

01:52:08.588 --> 01:52:09.956
INVESTIGATIONS THAT MAYBE

01:52:10.023 --> 01:52:12.759
UNNECESSARY OR INEFFICIENT.

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:13.626
THROUGH INTERNAL BUREAU

01:52:13.693 --> 01:52:15.028

01:52:15.095 --> 01:52:16.896
IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY SOMETHING

01:52:16.963 --> 01:52:18.531
SO WE THINK MAY BE THE CAUSE OF

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:20.867
SOME DELAYS AND ADDRESS THEM.

01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:22.068
SO WE HIRED AN IN HOUSE

SHIFT THEM AROUND BASED ON NEED.

01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:42.589
BEYOND WHAT THE OTHER HAS

01:52:42.655 --> 01:52:43.957

01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:44.858
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE TO

01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:46.960
FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAY ELIMINATE

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:48.161
DELAYS. AS WE MOVE TOWARD OUR

01:52:48.228 --> 01:52:50.396
GOAL OF GETTING TO THAT GETTING

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:50.930
EVERYTHING DONE WITHIN THE

HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME.

01:52:53.333 --> 01:52:53.867
OUR NEXT SPOTS THE AUDITOR IS

01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:57.370

01:52:57.437 --> 01:52:58.438
PLAN TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE

01:52:58.505 --> 01:52:59.906
STRATEGIC PLAN ON HOW TO

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:00.473
ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG AND BE

01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:03.710

ARE CURRENTLY BEING OFFERED FOR

01:53:11.584 --> 01:53:14.387
PLAY ANOTHER CARD ROOMS. AND WE

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:14.988
WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THESE

01:53:15.054 --> 01:53:15.522
TYPES OF DECISIONS IN THE

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:18.958
COMING MONTHS. ANOTHER ISSUE

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:20.226
THE AUDITOR FOUND WAS THAT THE

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:22.662
FEES CHARGED APPLICANTS AND

01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:23.229
OWNERS DON'T ALIGN WITH THE

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:23.796
COST OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY

01:53:23.863 --> 01:53:26.299
THE BUREAU. WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:27.600
CONDUCTING ANALYSIS OF ALL THE

01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:29.536
BUREAUS COSTS AND WORKING WITH

01:53:29.602 --> 01:53:30.637
THE COMMISSION TO ALIGN THE

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:31.237
VARIOUS FEES WITH THE COST OF

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:34.240
SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY THE

01:53:34.307 --> 01:53:35.275
AUDITOR INDICATED THAT WE WERE

01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:36.976
NOT BILLION PROPERLY. AND THE

01:53:37.043 --> 01:53:38.678
STAFF FOR SPENDING FAR TOO MUCH

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:39.245
TIME ON NON BILLABLE AND ON

01:53:39.312 --> 01:53:42.782
CASE WORK. AS A JUST TO CLARIFY

01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:44.384
WHAT NON BILLABLE TIME IS THIS

01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:46.319
IS A TERM THAT WE USE FOR TIME

01:53:46.386 --> 01:53:47.654
ASSOCIATED WITH THE BACKGROUND

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.455
INVESTIGATION. OF FOR WHICH

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:51.491
ANALYSTS EITHER COULD NOT BILL

01:53:51.558 --> 01:53:52.192
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY

01:53:52.258 --> 01:53:54.360
AUTHORITY TO DO SO. OR THEY

01:53:54.427 --> 01:53:56.229
SIMPLY DID NOT BILL SUCH AS

01:53:56.296 --> 01:53:57.697
WHEN AN EXPERIENCED ANALYST

01:53:57.764 --> 01:53:59.432
TRAINS A LESS EXPERIENCE

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:00.800
ANALYST HE WOULD NOT BILL FOR

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:02.936
THAT TIME BUT WOULD STILL BE

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:03.336
ASSOCIATED WITH AN

01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:06.472
INVESTIGATION. NON CASE TIMES

01:54:06.539 --> 01:54:07.974
TIME THAT COULD NOT BE

01:54:08.041 --> 01:54:09.275
ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:11.377
INVESTIGATION. SUCH AS ONE

01:54:11.444 --> 01:54:12.412
ANALYST RESPOND TO GENERAL

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:14.047
QUESTIONS FROM THE INDUSTRY.

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:15.582
WHEN THEY WORK ON SPECIAL PART

01:54:15.648 --> 01:54:17.784
PROJECTS OR WHEN THEY ARE

01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:19.085
RESPONDING TO THINGS LIKE

01:54:19.152 --> 01:54:19.652
SUBPOENAS AND PUBLIC RECORDS

01:54:19.719 --> 01:54:22.388
ACT REQUEST. SO IT'S WORK THAT

01:54:22.455 --> 01:54:23.656
NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT IT WASN'T

01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:27.894
ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC CASE.

01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:28.428
IN LATE APRIL THE BUREAU

01:54:28.494 --> 01:54:29.629
IMPLEMENTED A NEW POLICY ON

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:31.598
TIME TRACKING WHICH ESTABLISHED

01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:32.599
CRITERIA FOR BILLABLE NON

01:54:32.665 --> 01:54:35.768
BILLABLE AND NON CASE TIME. ALL

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:37.136
NON BILLABLE AND NON CASE TIME

01:54:37.203 --> 01:54:37.637
MUST BE PRE APPROVED BY

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:41.808
MANAGERS. BEFORE IT'S DONE. AND

01:54:41.874 --> 01:54:42.775
ONE VERY POSITIVE OUTCOME WE

01:54:42.842 --> 01:54:45.011
FOUND FROM THIS CHANGE IS THE

01:54:45.078 --> 01:54:45.612
INCREASE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

01:54:45.678 --> 01:54:48.581
US AND OUR STAFF. THE ASSISTANT

01:54:48.648 --> 01:54:50.116
DIRECTOR OF A LICENSING AND I

01:54:50.183 --> 01:54:51.818
MEET WITH ANALYST EVERY MONTH

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:54.187
WITHOUT THEIR MANAGERS TO IT

01:54:54.254 --> 01:54:55.888
TALK ABOUT THINGS AND TO GET

01:54:55.955 --> 01:54:56.456
THEIR DIRECT INPUT ON HEALTH

01:54:56.522 --> 01:54:58.925
THINGS ARE WORKING. EVERY OTHER

MANAGERS AND REVIEW EACH

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:04.197
ANALYST TIME. SO THIS ALLOWS US

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:05.598
TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:07.066
THEIR POLICY INDETERMINATE

01:55:07.133 --> 01:55:09.168
WHERE WE MEET IN MANY TO SHIFT

01:55:09.235 --> 01:55:09.736
RESOURCES TO CERTAIN LICENSE

01:55:09.802 --> 01:55:14.374
TYPES. IS ALSO TIME TO HEAR OUR

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.842
POLICIES ARE WORKING OR NOT

01:55:15.908 --> 01:55:16.476
WORKING AND HOW WE NEED TO KEEP

01:55:16.542 --> 01:55:20.179
ADJUSTING THEM. THE OTHER

01:55:20.246 --> 01:55:21.447
RECOMMENDED THAT WE ESTABLISHED

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:22.915
THRESHOLDS FOR BILLABLE NON

01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:24.917
BILLABLE AND NOT CASE TIME

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:26.653
WHICH WE'VE RECENTLY CREATED TO

01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:27.287
ENABLE US TO DETECT MORE ISSUES

01:55:27.353 --> 01:55:30.123
QUICKLY. WHEN THE AUDITOR

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:31.557
CONDUCTED ITS REVIEW IT

01:55:31.624 --> 01:55:32.792
CONCLUDED THAT ANALYSTS WERE

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:34.694
SPENDING 12% OF THEIR TIME ON

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:37.563
BILLABLE TIME 40% ON ON

01:55:37.630 --> 01:55:38.931

BILLABLE TIME AND 15% FOR NON

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.542
CASE TIME. THAT'S WHAT TO

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:50.476
EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT THE NON

01:55:50.543 --> 01:55:52.211
BILLABLE TIME DOES INCLUDE WORK

01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:53.680
FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO

01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:55.581

ON ON DESTINATIONS FOR THIRD

01:55:58.818 --> 01:56:01.888
PARTY PLAYERS. SO ONCE WE HAVE

01:56:01.954 --> 01:56:02.522
A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF THIS DATA

01:56:02.588 --> 01:56:05.458
AND ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH.

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:06.426

SPECIALS WE MAKE. THE NEXT

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:19.739
ISSUE THE AUDITOR IDENTIFIED

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:21.441

QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:32.018

MAYBE UNNECESSARY AND REMOVE

01:57:00.313 --> 01:57:02.248
THEM. AND THEN WE CREATED A

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:03.282
SINGLE SET OF PROCEDURES FOR

THESE INVESTIGATIONS WORK FROM

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:13.993
ONE SET OF INITIAL PROCEDURES.

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:14.594

REQUIRE A MORE IN DEPTH REVIEW

01:57:19.265 --> 01:57:21.234
NO ONE UNIT IS ABLE TO CHANGE

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:21.801
THE REQUIREMENTS SOLELY FOR

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:23.936
THEIR LICENSE TYPE. WE FOUND

01:57:24.003 --> 01:57:25.071
THE COMBINING POLICIES

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:26.706

01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:50.163
WORKING ON DOING THE SAME TYPE

01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:52.465

CARD ROOMS AND THIRD PARTY

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:58.604
PROVIDERS. I THINK THAT ONE OF

01:57:58.671 --> 01:57:59.705
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE

01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:01.974
HAD TO RETHINK AND EXPRESSED TO

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:02.475
ALL OF OUR STAFF IS THE

01:58:02.542 --> 01:58:05.445
PERCEPTION OF UNFAIRNESS. THERE

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:07.313
ARE TIMES IN THE PAST THAT FEES

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:09.015
WERE WAVED FROM REQUESTED BY

01:58:09.081 --> 01:58:11.217
INDUSTRY APPLICANTS OR- A C.

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:12.251
WHEN ANALYSTS MAY HAVE FEEL

01:58:12.318 --> 01:58:13.686
GUILTY FOR BILLING FOR

01:58:13.753 --> 01:58:15.655
INVESTIGATORY WORK WHICH DIDN'T

01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:17.924
LEAD TO A DEROGATORY FINDING.

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.558
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN

01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:21.260
MANAGEMENT'S PRIORITIZE MATTERS

01:58:21.327 --> 01:58:22.562
OVER OTHERS UPON REQUEST BY THE

01:58:22.628 --> 01:58:25.698
APPLICANT WEREN'T OFFICIAL.

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:27.033
THERE ALSO TIMES THE MANAGERS

01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:29.101
BEGAN ROUTINELY DIRECTING THEIR

01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:31.871
STAFF TO ASK CERTAIN QUESTIONS

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:32.472
EVEN WHAT NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:36.342
OF. THEY BASICALLY THOUGHT THE

01:58:36.409 --> 01:58:37.376
COMMISSION TO WANT THE

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:38.077
INFORMATION BASED ON

01:58:38.144 --> 01:58:39.712
EXPERIENCES HEARING THEME THEM

01:58:39.779 --> 01:58:44.383
ASK QUESTIONS THAT HEARINGS.

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:45.585
ALL OF THESE ACTIONS I THINK

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:46.686
MAY HAVE BEEN DONE WITH THE

01:58:46.752 --> 01:58:48.221
BEST INTENTIONS BUT NO ONE

01:58:48.287 --> 01:58:49.455
CONSIDER THE FACT THEY

01:58:49.522 --> 01:58:51.190
CONSTITUTED AN EQUAL TREATMENT

01:58:51.257 --> 01:58:52.525
IN COST APPLICANTS TO HAVE

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:54.594
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES WITH THE

01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:56.863
INVESTIGATION PROCESS. SO THIS

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:58.564
IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TO NOT

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.833
ONLY OPPRESS UPON OUR STAFF BUT

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:01.334
UPPER MANAGEMENT AS WELL

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:04.937
INCLUDING MYSELF. WHEN AN

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:06.405
OCCASION ARISES WHERE WE MAY

01:59:06.472 --> 01:59:08.107
WANT TO TREAT ENOUGH APPLICANT

01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:09.909
FAIRLY UNFAIR DIFFERENTLY

01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:12.612
ALRIGHT FOR WHATEVER REASON.

01:59:12.678 --> 01:59:13.179
THE FIRST QUESTION WE ALWAYS

01:59:13.246 --> 01:59:16.015
ASK IS WHAT IS THE POLICY SAY.

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:17.583
DEFAULTING TO POLICY RESULTS IN

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:19.318
CONSISTENCY AND ELIMINATES

01:59:19.385 --> 01:59:20.186
DIFFERENT TREATMENT OF

01:59:20.253 --> 01:59:21.988
INDIVIDUALS THIS IS SOMETHING

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:23.322
THAT WE STRESS IN CONTINUE TO

01:59:23.389 --> 01:59:26.626
ADDRESS ON A DAILY BASIS.

01:59:26.692 --> 01:59:28.160
FINALLY THE UDITOR INDICATED

01:59:28.227 --> 01:59:29.462
THAT IT HAD TROUBLE VERIFYING

01:59:29.529 --> 01:59:32.064
INFORMATION DURING THE AUDIT

01:59:32.131 --> 01:59:32.632
BECAUSE OF ARE INSUFFICIENT

01:59:32.698 --> 01:59:35.101
RECORDS RETENTION POLICIES. WE

01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:37.303

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:42.208
STAFF TO ENSURE THAT ALL FILES

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:44.710
CONTAIN CERTAIN INFORMATION AND

01:59:44.777 --> 01:59:45.244
THAT CERTAIN DOCUMENTS ARE

01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:47.813
SCANNED AND RETAINED. AS WITH

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:49.148
SOME OTHER ISSUES WE'RE FINDING

01:59:49.215 --> 01:59:50.182
THAT WE HAVE ANY FOR SOME

01:59:50.249 --> 01:59:52.251
SUPPORT STAFF WHO CAN ROUTINELY

01:59:52.318 --> 01:59:53.553
CONDUCT THIS TYPE OF WORK SO

01:59:53.619 --> 01:59:55.454
THE ANALYSTS CAN. CONCENTRATE

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:58.057
ON THEIR INVESTIGATIOS. WHICH

01:59:58.124 --> 01:59:59.492
WILL THEN ULTIMATELY HELP US

01:59:59.559 --> 02:00:00.059
REACH OUR HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY

02:00:00.126 --> 02:00:03.996

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:36.201
AND I THINK THAT SOME OF IT

02:09:36.268 --> 02:09:37.369
DOES HAVE TO DO WITH THE TYPE

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:39.371
OF CASES THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING

02:09:39.438 --> 02:09:41.640
ON SOME TAKE MUCH LESS TIME

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:43.242
THAN OTHERS THE THINGS LIKE FOR

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:44.143
THE KHARTOUM OVER LICENSES IT

02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:46.345
CAN BE VERY LENGTHY. WE'RE

02:09:46.411 --> 02:09:47.813
TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT BY

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:49.314
MAKING SURE WE ARE GETTING

02:09:49.381 --> 02:09:50.983
EVERYTHING WITHIN THAT HUNDRED

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:52.451
AND EIGHTY DAY TIME FRAME THAT

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:55.254
IS THE GOAL. SO WE DO HAVE TO

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.655
UPDATE ALL THE TIME ESTIMATES I

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:58.657
WISH I HAD AT. AT YOU KNOW JUST

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:00.192
A VERY CLEAR RESPONSE ON WHY

02:10:00.259 --> 02:10:01.627
THAT IS I THINK WE JUST

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:03.428
RECOGNIZE IT AND REALIZE THAT

02:10:03.495 --> 02:10:04.329
WE HAVE TO UPDATE OUR

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:05.831
INFORMATION AND MAKE SURE THEY

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:06.498
WERE KEEPING TRACK OF

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:08.767
EVERYTHING. IN HOLDING PEOPLE

02:10:08.834 --> 02:10:10.502
ACCOUNTABLE TO MEET THOSE TIME

02:10:10.569 --> 02:10:12.838
LINES CURRY. THAT'S WHAT THE

02:10:12.905 --> 02:10:14.806
AUDIT IS KIND OF POINT OUT THAT

02:10:14.873 --> 02:10:15.340
MAYBE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

02:10:15.407 --> 02:10:16.542
TRACKING OR MAYBE IT'S A

02:10:16.608 --> 02:10:18.944
CHECKLIST. BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE

02:10:19.011 --> 02:10:20.646
THE FIGURES THE HUNDRED AND

02:10:20.712 --> 02:10:22.548
EIGHTY DAYS YOU KNOW WHEN 70%

02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:23.282
OF THE CASES AREN'T EVEN

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:24.216
MEETING THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

02:10:24.283 --> 02:10:26.018
D. THRESHOLD. YOU HAVE TO ASK

02:10:26.084 --> 02:10:28.620
YOUR YOURSELF WHY IS THAT. AND

02:10:28.687 --> 02:10:29.688
WHAT IS THE BUREAU DONE TO

02:10:29.755 --> 02:10:32.257
ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THAT ISSUE

02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:34.960
AND ONE I THINK UNDER US. UNDER

02:10:35.027 --> 02:10:36.662
A STATUTE YOU HAVE TO NOTIFY

02:10:36.728 --> 02:10:39.431
PEOPLE WHEN IS YOUR CASE GOING

02:10:39.498 --> 02:10:40.032
TO BE RESOLVED AND THAT'S NOT

02:10:40.098 --> 02:10:41.833
HAPPENING EITHER. SO HE COULD

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.435
DRESS OF THAT PLACE SURE IT IS

02:10:43.502 --> 02:10:44.336
HAPPENING NOW THERE ARE

02:10:44.403 --> 02:10:45.971
REQUIREMENTS REGULATIONS ON

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:47.039
WHEN WE HAVE TO NOTIFY

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:48.106
APPLICANTS IF WE'RE NOT GOING

02:10:48.173 --> 02:10:50.275
TO FINISH THOSE. THOSE

02:10:50.342 --> 02:10:51.910
INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN A HUNDRED

02:10:51.977 --> 02:10:53.612
EIGHTY DAYS IT IS A HUNDRED

02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:54.680
EIGHTY DAYS AS PRACTICABLE O

02:10:54.746 --> 02:10:56.748
THEY IT DOES LEAVE SOME. SOME

02:10:56.815 --> 02:10:58.350
ROOM IF WE NEED TO LET PEOPLE

02:10:58.417 --> 02:10:59.384
KNOW EVER GONNA TAKE LONGER

02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:01.019
TIME WE NEED TO LET THEM KNOW

02:11:01.086 --> 02:11:02.621
AND FRANKLY THAT WASN'T

02:11:02.688 --> 02:11:03.488
HAPPENING ALL THE TIME. SO IT

02:11:03.555 --> 02:11:05.624
IS HAPPENING NOW A WITH THE

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:06.225
HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS HAVE TO

02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:07.693
STRESS TO WHEN WE WERE

02:11:07.759 --> 02:11:09.761
GENERALLY TAKING CASES FIRST

02:11:09.828 --> 02:11:12.497
AND MOVING THEM FORWARD. IT WAS

02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:14.433
WHEN THERE IS THAT BACKLOG THAT

02:11:14.499 --> 02:11:16.468
THOSE LAST ONES IN ARE ALWAYS

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:17.970
GOING TO EXCEED A HUNDRED

02:11:18.036 --> 02:11:19.071
EIGHTY DAYS SO IT'S REALLY KIND%

02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:21.240
OF CATCHING UP TO. GET US WHERE

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:22.441
WE NEED TO BE SO EVEN THE ONES

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:24.910
COMING IN WE CAN FINISH RIGHT

02:11:24.977 --> 02:11:25.944
NOW IT WAS WE WERE WORKING ON

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:32.751
THE ONCE YOU CAME IN BEFORE.

02:11:32.818 --> 02:11:33.352
AND SO THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS

02:11:33.418 --> 02:11:38.924
JUST KEPT LAPSING FOR ALL OF.

02:11:38.991 --> 02:11:40.125
THE CASES THAT CAME IN. AGAIN

02:11:40.192 --> 02:11:41.093
RECOGNIZING THAT THE WE HAVE

02:11:41.159 --> 02:11:42.160
TO. GET RID OF WHAT THE BACKLOG

02:11:42.227 --> 02:11:44.129
IS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE

02:11:44.196 --> 02:11:44.696
PENDING WORKLOAD IN A TIMELY

02:11:44.763 --> 02:11:46.832
MANNER. SO HOW WOULD YOU

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:48.033
ACCOUNT FOR HIM A LEGISLATURE

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:48.900
MADE ALLOCATION SO THAT WE CAN

02:11:48.967 --> 02:11:49.468
ADDRESS THE BACKLOG WE HIRED

02:11:49.534 --> 02:11:50.902
ADDITIONAL STAFF. BUT STILL NOT

02:11:50.969 --> 02:11:52.204
SEEING THE REDUCTION IN THAT

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:53.605
BACKLOG WHY IS THAT. I DON'T

02:11:53.672 --> 02:11:54.906
HAVE A I DON'T HAVE AN EASY

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:56.575
ANSWER FOR YOU I THINK IT'S

02:11:56.642 --> 02:11:57.242
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:11:57.309 --> 02:11:58.577
WHY DOES IT TAKE LONGER WAS AT

02:11:58.644 --> 02:12:00.445
THE TIME THAT CASES AGAIN WAS A

02:12:00.512 --> 02:12:02.314
TURN OVER ALL THOSE THINGS WE

02:12:02.381 --> 02:12:02.914
NEED TO CONSIDER TO MAKE SURE

02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:04.950
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. WE'RE

02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:05.884
VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:07.586
LEGISLATURE FOR GIVING US THOSE

02:12:07.653 --> 02:12:09.821
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS DEFINITELY

02:12:09.888 --> 02:12:12.457
NEED HEM BUT WE ARE REALLY

02:12:12.524 --> 02:12:14.026
TRYING TO WORK WITH WHAT WE

02:12:14.092 --> 02:12:17.429
HAVE AT THIS POINT AND NOT

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:18.730
SEEKING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AT

02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:20.265
THIS POINT TRYING TO JUST GET

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:23.035
THAT BACKLOG DOWN WITH THE WITH

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:23.869
THE POSITIONS LEGISLATURE HAS

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:25.537
PROVIDED US CORRECT YOU CAN SEE

02:12:25.604 --> 02:12:26.872
WHY THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

02:12:26.938 --> 02:12:28.440
SEE SOME TRANSPARENCY

02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:29.875
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT COUSIN

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:33.078
WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT. WITH

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:35.847
SOME OF THE FIGURES LIKE FIGURE

02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:36.448
TEN ON PAGE FORTY WORK SHOWS.

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:40.085
YOU KNOW. STAFF SPENDING 50% OF

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:41.086
THEIR TIME ON NON BILLABLE.

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:42.821
THINGS YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF

02:12:42.888 --> 02:12:44.022
WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH ALL

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:45.023
THAT TIME IF THEY'RE NOT

02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:47.092
REDUCING CASELOADS. AND THEY'RE

02:12:47.159 --> 02:12:48.727
NOT SPENDING HALF EVEN HALF

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:51.229
THEIR TIME. ON THESE BILLABLE

02:12:51.296 --> 02:12:52.564
THREE ITEMS YOU KNOW WHAT'S

02:12:52.631 --> 02:12:54.333
REALLY HAPPENING. YEAH I WILL

02:12:54.399 --> 02:12:56.368
SAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE STAFF

02:12:57.369 --> 02:12:58.770
PROJECTS OF WE NEED SOMETHING

02:12:58.837 --> 02:13:00.072
ANALYZE IF WE NEED SOMETHING.

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:02.641
WE REALLY TRY. TO NOT DO THAT

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:03.942
ANYMORE REALIZING SOME OF THE

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:05.777
WORKLOAD HAS TO BE DONE IT'S

02:13:05.844 --> 02:13:07.212
REALLY FRANKLY DEFINE A LOT TO

02:13:07.279 --> 02:13:09.348
THE MANAGERS. AND PEOPLE KINDA

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:11.683

WE WILL SAY A WORD YOU KNOW WE

02:13:13.085 --> 02:13:13.585
WANT SOMEONE TO DO THAT IS A

02:13:13.652 --> 02:13:14.186
NON CASE TIME IS THAT HUMM

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:15.253
BILLABLE TIME AND WE'RE VERY

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.589
FOCUSED ON. MAKING SURE WE WANT

02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:19.091
ANALYSTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL TO

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:20.192
SIR TRYING NOT TO DIVERT THEIR

02:13:20.258 --> 02:13:21.760
TIME AWAY FROM THOSE

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.695
INVESTIGATIONS REALIZING THERE

02:13:23.762 --> 02:13:25.297
ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE'RE

02:13:25.364 --> 02:13:25.864
GONNA NEED THEIR ASSISTANCE

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:26.498
WITH. THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO

02:13:26.565 --> 02:13:29.434
ADDRESS. SO THAT'S WHY THERE IS

02:13:29.501 --> 02:13:30.469
GOING TO BE SOME LEVEL OF NON

02:13:30.535 --> 02:13:32.571
CASE TIME. WHEN WE ARE LOOKING

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:35.407
AT THE COST AND HOW TO. MAKE

02:13:35.474 --> 02:13:36.408
SURE THE COST COVER OUR

02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:37.609
SERVICES THOSE ARE THINGS WE

02:13:37.676 --> 02:13:39.511
HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHICH

02:13:39.578 --> 02:13:40.879
ONES ARE GOING TO BE COVERED BY

02:13:40.946 --> 02:13:42.848
THE INVESTIGATION FEES THE

02:13:42.914 --> 02:13:45.350
DEPOSITS. AND WHICH MAY NEED TO

02:13:45.417 --> 02:13:45.884
BE COVERED BY A DIFFERENT

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:48.320
SOURCE I'M- A FEES BUT TRYING

02:13:48.387 --> 02:13:49.221

02:13:49.287 --> 02:13:50.822
DOWN SO WE CAN WORK WITH THE

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:52.424
COMMISSION. TO YOU KNOW TO THE

02:13:52.491 --> 02:13:54.559

THINK THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:56.962
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS ALL OF

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:58.930

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:00.065
TO ALIGN THE FEES. WITH THE

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:01.400
REGULATORY COSTS BECAUSE THERE

02:14:01.466 --> 02:14:03.468
SEEMS TO BE AS OUTLINED BY THE

02:14:03.535 --> 02:14:06.705

RECOMMENDATIONS ALONG THE

02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:14.146
ALIGNMENT OF FEES. SO THIS IS

02:14:14.212 --> 02:14:15.447
KIND OF AN ONGOING PROCESS

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:17.015

02:14:47.512 --> 02:14:47.946
SOME OF THOSE INCREASED

02:14:48.013 --> 02:14:48.580

PROCESS GETTING ALL THE

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:35.861
INFORMATION TOGETHER WORKING

WITH THE CONSULTANT. SO I MEAN

02:15:37.596 --> 02:15:39.798
WE'RE STARTING NOW. REALIZING

02:15:39.865 --> 02:15:40.999
THAT THE WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT

02:15:41.066 --> 02:15:43.802
SOME OF THE THINGS AND SEE IF

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:44.402
WE NEED TO UPDATE SOME OF OUR

02:15:44.469 --> 02:15:49.074
NUMBERS. SO WE'RE WORKING ON IT

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:49.975
THANK YOU. YES COMMISSION TO OF

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:54.012
ANTICIPATED TIMELINES FOR

ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THIS. AS

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:57.349
STATED TWO OF THE FIVE OF THE

02:15:57.415 --> 02:15:59.317
COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS

02:15:59.384 --> 02:16:01.486
ARE COMPLETED ALREADY. HIDE SO

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:04.556
THE OTHER THREE. TO WE ARE

02:16:04.623 --> 02:16:07.058
WORKING ON. RIGHT NOW WE START

02:16:07.125 --> 02:16:08.326
WORKING ON THEM BEFORE THE

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:09.861
AUDIT REPORT ACTUALLY CAME OUT

02:16:09.928 --> 02:16:12.898
AS A STEPHANIE MENTIONED. WE

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:14.399
ARE WORKING ON THE COST IN FEET

02:16:14.466 --> 02:16:16.902
ANALYSIS. THE OTHER

02:16:16.968 --> 02:16:18.937
RECOMMENDATION IS THE

02:16:19.004 --> 02:16:21.406
CONSISTENCY OF THE LICENSE OF

02:16:21.473 --> 02:16:23.675
MONTHS LICENSE TYPES. AS STATED

02:16:23.742 --> 02:16:25.610
WE ALREADY HAD A REGULATORY

02:16:25.677 --> 02:16:27.279
PACKAGE THAT HAD GONE OUT FOR

02:16:27.345 --> 02:16:28.747
PUBLIC COMMENT WE HELD A

02:16:28.813 --> 02:16:32.117
WORKSHOP EARLIER THIS WEEK. IT

02:16:32.183 --> 02:16:33.051
IS MOVING ON TO THE FORMAL RULE

02:16:33.118 --> 02:16:35.754
MAKING PROCESS. OBVIOUSLY THE

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:36.955
OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

02:16:37.022 --> 02:16:39.257
HAS VERY SPECIFIC. GUIDELINES

02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:41.693
IN WHICH YOU MUST MEET. FOR

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:43.795
STATE COLOR NOTIFICATION.

02:16:43.862 --> 02:16:46.097
GATHERING FISCAL IMPACT SO

02:16:46.164 --> 02:16:46.865
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT

02:16:46.932 --> 02:16:48.567
STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT WE

02:16:48.633 --> 02:16:49.401
ARE ALREADY WORKING ON THAT

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:52.470
PROCESS. THE THIRD.

02:16:52.537 --> 02:16:53.672
RECOMMENDATION IS THE STATUTORY

02:16:53.738 --> 02:16:56.741
CHANGE. SO WE WILL HAVE TO

02:16:56.808 --> 02:16:59.311
PROPOSE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:01.046
THOSE APPLICABLE STATUTES.

02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:02.514
DURING THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:03.715
CORRECT AND DO YOU GUYS HAVE AN

02:17:03.782 --> 02:17:04.482
OPINION ON THAT BECAUSE I KNOW

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:06.685
THE STATE OUT OF A RECOMMENDED.

02:17:06.751 --> 02:17:07.953
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:10.488
AMEND THE GAMBLING GAMBLING ACT

02:17:10.555 --> 02:17:11.356
TO ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO TAKE

02:17:11.423 --> 02:17:12.891
ACTION ON ITS REGULATORY.

02:17:12.958 --> 02:17:14.793
WHAT'S AS REGULAR LICENSING

02:17:14.859 --> 02:17:20.398
MEETINGS RATHER THAN REQUIRING.

02:17:20.465 --> 02:17:25.670
EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS DC. THAT

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:26.805
AS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:17:26.871 --> 02:17:27.405
DIRECTION SOMETHING WE SHOULD

02:17:27.472 --> 02:17:28.273
DO HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT WE DO

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:29.441
WE SUPPORT THAT RECOMMENDATION.

02:17:29.507 --> 02:17:30.075
OBVIOUSLY IT'S STILL IMPORTANT

02:17:30.141 --> 02:17:30.842
FOR THE COMMISSIONERS TO STILL

02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:31.443
HAVE THE OPTION TO ST

02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:32.577
APPLICANTS TO AN EVIDENTIARY

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:34.546
HEARING IN THOSE CASES WHERE

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:35.480
IT'S SIMPLY THAT MORE

02:17:35.547 --> 02:17:37.382
INFORMATION IS NEEDED. AND MORE

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:38.883
INFORMATION MIGHT BE BETTER

02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:39.985
OBTAIN THROUGH AN EVIDENTIARY

02:17:40.051 --> 02:17:42.687
HEARING PROCESS WHERE. THE DATE

02:17:42.754 --> 02:17:44.155
THE APPLICANT CAN HAVE THEIR

02:17:44.222 --> 02:17:46.458
DUE PROCESS. BRING WITNESSES BE

02:17:46.524 --> 02:17:49.394
SUBJECT TO CROSS EXAMINATION

02:17:49.461 --> 02:17:50.695
PROVIDE TESTIMONY UNDER OATH

02:17:50.762 --> 02:17:52.597
HAS SO AS LONG AS THE

02:17:52.664 --> 02:17:54.065
COMMISSION STILL HAS THAT

02:17:54.132 --> 02:17:55.900
ABILITY WHICH I BELIEVE WAS THE

02:17:55.967 --> 02:17:58.703
AUDITOR'S INTENDED AS WELL. BUT

02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:00.939
IT IT. IT WOULD ALLOW FOR THOSE

02:18:01.006 --> 02:18:02.307
APPLICANTS THAT DO NOT WANT TO

02:18:02.374 --> 02:18:03.508
BE PART OF THE EVIDENTIARY

02:18:03.575 --> 02:18:05.577
HEARING PROCESS IF THE ISSUANCE

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:08.780
OF THE NILE WAS MADE. TO SIMPL

02:18:08.847 --> 02:18:10.348
FAST TRACK THAT TONIGHT RIGHT

02:18:10.415 --> 02:18:10.982
TO THE CORE TRYING TO LOOK AT

02:18:11.049 --> 02:18:12.117
IS TIME FRAMES AND HOW DO YOU

02:18:12.183 --> 02:18:13.618
REDUCES TIME FRAME TO GET MORE

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:17.222
WORK DONE SOONER. GIVEN GIVEN

02:18:17.288 --> 02:18:19.658
THAT'S KIND OF THE GOAL OF USER

02:18:19.724 --> 02:18:20.358
ANOTHER WAY WE SHOULD BE

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:22.427
LOOKING AT THIS OR IS THAT KIND

02:18:22.494 --> 02:18:24.362
OF. THE MESSAGES IS BY AMANDA

02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:25.697
LANG AMENDING THE ACT WELL I

02:18:25.764 --> 02:18:27.098
THINK THE OTHER RECOMMENDATION

02:18:27.165 --> 02:18:28.800
THAT THE ORDER HAD WITH REGARDS

02:18:28.867 --> 02:18:29.701
TO STRENGTHENING OUR WITHDRAWAL

02:18:29.768 --> 02:18:31.903
NOTIFICATION PROCESS. I THINK

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:33.872
THAT THAT WILL ALSO HELP

02:18:33.938 --> 02:18:35.607
BECAUSE THAT PROVIDED THE

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:38.276
APPLICANT EVEN MORE DETAIL AS

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:39.644
TO HELD A WITHDRAWAL THEMSELVES

02:18:39.711 --> 02:18:41.913
FROM THAT PROCESS. SO WE MADE

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:43.515
EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS JUST

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:46.484
IMPLEMENTED IN APRIL OF TWENTY

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:47.819
NINETEEN WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:50.622
THE EFFECT OF THAT PER SE BUT-

02:18:50.689 --> 02:18:52.657
HOPEFULLY. APPLICANTS THAT DO

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:53.458
NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT

02:18:53.525 --> 02:18:55.593
PROCESS WILL ABIDE BY THOSE

02:18:55.660 --> 02:19:02.067
NOTIFICATIONS. TO THEM AND

02:19:02.133 --> 02:19:09.240
FOLLOWED THE PROCESS OF A DRAW.

02:19:09.307 --> 02:19:09.741
RIGHT TO LOOK FORWARD TO

02:19:09.808 --> 02:19:10.341
WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT AND

02:19:10.408 --> 02:19:13.078
OUR STAFF AS WELL. I KNOW SO

02:19:13.144 --> 02:19:13.578
THEY'RE MORE LIKE HAS A

02:19:13.645 --> 02:19:14.112
QUESTION PLEASE. THANK YOU

SEEM TO INFER THAT THAT YOU

02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:27.959
WERE FINE WITH WITH WITH THE

02:19:28.026 --> 02:19:31.629
RECOMMENDATION. WELL SPEAK FOR

02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:32.697
HERS BUT YES I DO I BELIEVE

02:19:32.764 --> 02:19:33.264
THERE FAIR AGAIN WHEN I HAD

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:33.865
MENTIONED THAT IT IT'S REALLY

02:19:33.932 --> 02:19:35.033
HARD TO TAKE IN IT WAS A LOT.

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:36.167
OF TIME SPENT WITH THE AUDITORS

02:19:36.234 --> 02:19:37.068
BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS

02:19:37.135 --> 02:19:37.902
PROFESSIONAL AND COURTEOUS

02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:39.137
PLEASANT AND THEY HAD SOME GOOD

02:19:39.204 --> 02:19:41.206
RECOMMENDATIONS AND IT'S NOW UP

02:19:41.272 --> 02:19:41.806
TO US TO TAKE THOSE IMPLEMENT

02:19:41.873 --> 02:19:43.141
THEM AND- YOU KNOW COME UP WITH

02:19:43.208 --> 02:19:44.142
OUR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL

02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:45.810
TO MAKE THE PROCESS BETTER SO

02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:47.245
WE'RE ALL FOR IMPROVING OUR

02:19:47.312 --> 02:19:50.582
PROCESSES SO YEAH I WOULD SAY

02:19:50.648 --> 02:19:51.649
WAS FAIR. I WOULD AGREE WITH

02:19:51.716 --> 02:19:52.917
THAT THEY WERE VERY THOROUGH

02:19:52.984 --> 02:19:53.752
THEY LIKE TO ALL OF OUR

02:19:53.818 --> 02:19:54.385
POLICIES PROCEDURES THEY SPOKE

02:19:54.452 --> 02:19:56.054
TO INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE PART

02:19:56.121 --> 02:19:58.890
OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS

02:19:58.957 --> 02:20:00.258
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND OUR

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:02.327
PROCESSES. IT WAS EXCELLENT

02:20:02.393 --> 02:20:04.062
COMMUNICATION THROUGHOUT THEY

02:20:04.129 --> 02:20:05.730
REALLY GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY

02:20:05.797 --> 02:20:07.432
TO PROVIDE OUR SIDE OF THE

02:20:07.499 --> 02:20:09.534
STORY WHEN THEY HAD FINDING SO

02:20:09.601 --> 02:20:12.570
YES I BELIEVE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY

02:20:12.637 --> 02:20:13.171
FAIR. SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE

02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:17.475
OUT. WHAT MIGHT BE THE REASON

02:20:17.542 --> 02:20:20.712
FOR A SLOW DOWN OR SO I I'M

02:20:20.779 --> 02:20:21.246
WONDERING HAS HAD HAVE YOU

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:24.015
APPROVED SOMEONE. IN THIS

02:20:24.082 --> 02:20:26.551
PROCESS THAT TURNED OUT NOT TO

02:20:26.618 --> 02:20:27.185
MEET THE STANDARDS THAT WASN'T

02:20:27.252 --> 02:20:29.454
HONEST AND WASN'T. A PERSON OF

02:20:29.521 --> 02:20:30.688
GOOD CHARACTER AND YOU GO ALL

02:20:30.755 --> 02:20:36.194
WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:38.029
I CANNOT THINK OF A SPECIFIC

02:20:38.096 --> 02:20:39.297
CASEWHERE THAT MIGHT HAVE

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:42.667
HAPPENED. BROWSE THE TOP OF MY

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:45.537
HEAD BUT IF THAT SCENARIO DID

02:20:45.603 --> 02:20:46.905
OCCUR THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE

02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:49.607
BUREAU GAMELY CONTROL TO REVIEW

02:20:49.674 --> 02:20:51.810
AT THE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCE

02:20:51.876 --> 02:20:53.845
WHEN A SCENARIO LIKE THAT DOES

02:20:53.912 --> 02:20:56.114
OCCUR AND THEY'RE ABLE TO BRING

02:20:56.181 --> 02:20:57.615
FORTH AN ACCUSATION OR

02:20:57.682 --> 02:21:00.251
IDENTIFY. THE ISSUES OF CONCERN

02:21:00.318 --> 02:21:02.687
THROUGH THE RENEWAL PROCESS AT

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:05.723
WHICH TIME THE COMMISSIONERS

02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:06.291
WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE

02:21:06.357 --> 02:21:06.891
FINDINGS AND CONSIDER THEM AT

02:21:06.958 --> 02:21:08.393
THAT PARK. SO I'M TRYING TO

02:21:08.459 --> 02:21:11.496
FIGURE OUT IS IT. AN ANALYSIS

02:21:11.563 --> 02:21:14.766
PARALYSIS OR. BECAUSE BECAUSE

02:21:14.833 --> 02:21:18.770
THIS THIS IS THIS THIS REPORT.

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:21.206
SEEMS TO IMPLY A SIGNIFICANT

02:21:21.272 --> 02:21:23.541
MANAGEMENT FAILURE AND IT SEEMS

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:24.175
AS IF THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR

02:21:24.242 --> 02:21:26.811
YEARS THAT. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

02:21:26.878 --> 02:21:28.112
SAYING IT'S BEEN A SLOW PROCESS

02:21:28.179 --> 02:21:33.284
AND NOW THE NUMBERS ARE. RATHER.

02:21:33.351 --> 02:21:34.485
FRUSTRATING TO SEE THE

02:21:34.552 --> 02:21:36.387
PERCENTAGES OF HOW MUCH OF

02:21:36.454 --> 02:21:37.655
THOSE THAT HAVE APPLIED IT

02:21:37.722 --> 02:21:39.424
TAKEN MORE THAN A HUNDRED

02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:40.792
EIGHTY DAYS AND WE'RE TALKING

02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:42.994
SOME SIX YEARS SO I'M I'M I'M

02:21:43.061 --> 02:21:46.764
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IF YOU

02:21:46.831 --> 02:21:48.099
WERE TO SAY THIS IS THE ROOT

02:21:48.166 --> 02:21:51.569
CAUSE AND HERE'S IF I HAD A

02:21:51.636 --> 02:21:53.771
MAGIC WAND THIS IS WHAT I WOULD

02:21:53.838 --> 02:21:58.443
DO TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS. THEY

02:21:58.509 --> 02:21:59.978
ALL TAKE THE HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:00.945
DAYS FROM STACY IS INSIDE IS A

02:22:01.012 --> 02:22:02.513
WITH THE BUREAUS WE ARE

02:22:02.580 --> 02:22:03.314
REQUIRED TO MEET THOSE TIME

02:22:03.381 --> 02:22:05.350
LINES AND JUST TO CLARIFY THE

02:22:05.416 --> 02:22:06.818
BUREAU MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO

02:22:06.885 --> 02:22:07.886
THE COMMISSION. WHO THEN MAKES

02:22:07.952 --> 02:22:09.520
DECISIONS BUT LIKE SAYS HE SAID

02:22:09.587 --> 02:22:11.122
THAT WE ARE THE KIND OF THE

02:22:11.189 --> 02:22:12.924
FULL ENFORCEMENT ARM AFTERWARDS

02:22:12.991 --> 02:22:14.792
SO IF SOMEONE GETS LICENSED AND

02:22:14.859 --> 02:22:16.561
SOMETHING HAPPENS THEN WE CAN

02:22:16.628 --> 02:22:17.695
BRING FORWARD AN ACCUSATION TO

02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:20.265
REVOKE THAT LICENSE. IN TERMS

02:22:20.331 --> 02:22:23.801
OF I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S

02:22:23.868 --> 02:22:27.038
FRUSTRATING I TOTALLY AGREE.

02:22:27.105 --> 02:22:30.141
AND I JUST DON'T HAVE A M. ONE

02:22:30.208 --> 02:22:31.542
SPECIFIC ANSWER WHAT WHAT

02:22:31.609 --> 02:22:32.944
OCCURRED TO THAT. KIND OF GOT

02:22:33.011 --> 02:22:33.912
US IN THIS PLACE WERE TRYING TO

02:22:33.978 --> 02:22:36.147
KEEP CATCHING UP I THINK THAT

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:37.515
WE CERTAINLY HAVE IT WITHIN US

02:22:37.582 --> 02:22:39.117
TO MEET THOSE ONE HUNDRED

02:22:39.183 --> 02:22:39.784
EIGHTY TIME FRAMES ONCE WE GET

02:22:39.851 --> 02:22:41.252
RID OF THE BACKLOG AND WE'RE

02:22:41.319 --> 02:22:42.253
JUST DEALING WITH THE PENDING

02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:43.655
CASES THAT COME AND- GET THEM

02:22:43.721 --> 02:22:45.156
DONE IN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS.

02:22:45.223 --> 02:22:46.257
AGAIN SOME OF THE LICENSING

02:22:46.324 --> 02:22:48.059
OWNER ONES MAY TAKE A LONGER

02:22:48.126 --> 02:22:49.961
TIME BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE

02:22:50.028 --> 02:22:51.296
MAJORITY OF THEM WE CAN GET

02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:53.264
THAT DONE IT'S JUST GETTING RID

02:22:53.331 --> 02:22:54.499
OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:55.867
IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET RID OF

02:22:55.934 --> 02:22:57.468
THAT BACKLOG SO WE CAN THEN

02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:58.670
JUST CONCENTRATE ON ALWAYS

02:22:58.736 --> 02:23:00.972
MAINTAINING THAT. WITH THE

02:23:01.039 --> 02:23:05.343
PENDING APPLICATIONS. SO I WE

02:23:05.410 --> 02:23:05.910
HEAR YOU AND UNDERSTAND THAT

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:09.614
BUT- SO WHEN YOU GET AN

02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:12.350
APPLICATION YOU SHOULD SAY

02:23:12.417 --> 02:23:12.917
RIGHT AWAY AS A MANAGER OKAY

02:23:12.984 --> 02:23:15.753
THIS IS GONNA TAKE FORTY HOURS.

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:16.354
SO THAT'S ONE WEEK OF A PERSON

02:23:16.421 --> 02:23:20.425
FULL TIME. IT'S SO THAT YOU CAN

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.193
BUDGET HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU NEED

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:24.462
FOR THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS

02:23:24.529 --> 02:23:25.697
AND YOU'RE RUNNING ONE OF THE

02:23:25.763 --> 02:23:27.832
LARGEST LAW FIRMS IN THE STATE

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:28.900
RIGHT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:30.134
OFFICE YOU. ALREADY KNOW HOW TO

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:31.569
DO TIME IN BILLING YOU KNOW HOW

02:23:31.636 --> 02:23:34.238
TO THE SIGN WORKLOADS SO I'M

02:23:34.305 --> 02:23:34.772
I'M WONDER FOR MANAGEMENT

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:41.512
STANDPOINT. WHY WHY ISN'T THAT

02:23:41.579 --> 02:23:42.513
WHY DOES THAT SEEM TO BE

02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:43.781
WORKING RIGHT AND SO MAYBE TO

02:23:43.848 --> 02:23:45.516
PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION ON

02:23:45.583 --> 02:23:47.018
HOW WE CAN DISTRIBUTE THE CASES

02:23:47.085 --> 02:23:49.020
SO IT'S NOT A CASE COMES IN AND

02:23:49.087 --> 02:23:50.355
THEN THAN AN ANALYST WORKS

02:23:50.421 --> 02:23:51.689
UNTIL IT'S DONE THEY USUALLY

02:23:51.756 --> 02:23:53.157
GET SEVERAL CASES BECAUSE ARE

02:23:53.224 --> 02:23:54.826
IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF REVIEW

02:23:54.892 --> 02:23:56.027
THE REQUESTING DATABASE CHECKS

02:23:56.094 --> 02:23:57.562
OR WAITING FOR THE INFORMATION

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.464
WHEN THEY GET THE APPLICATIONS

02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:01.299
THEY SOMETIMES HAVE QUESTIONS

02:24:01.366 --> 02:24:01.899
FOR THE APPLICANT SO THEY'RE

02:24:01.966 --> 02:24:04.235
WAITING FOR INFORMATION. ONE OF

02:24:04.302 --> 02:24:05.603
THE THINGS THAT WE CHANGES

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:06.504
BEFORE THEY WOULD JUST

02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:07.939
BASICALLY CONCENTRATE ON THE

02:24:08.006 --> 02:24:09.640
ONE LICENSE TYPE WE REALIZE

02:24:09.707 --> 02:24:10.608
THAT THERE ARE SOME DOWNTIME IN

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:12.243
BETWEEN WHEN THEY'RE WAITING

02:24:12.310 --> 02:24:13.644
FOR THINGS SO NOW INSTEAD OF

02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:17.148
WAITING OR HAVING NON CASE TIME

02:24:17.215 --> 02:24:18.449
THEY'RE PICKING UP OTHER TYPES

02:24:18.516 --> 02:24:20.251
OF CASES MAYBE A FIVE CARD IN

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:21.586
ORDER LICENSE WHICH TAKES

02:24:21.652 --> 02:24:23.121
LONGER THEY CAN PICK UP WORK

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:24.288
PERMITS THEY CAN PICK UP THIRD

02:24:24.355 --> 02:24:26.157
PARTY PLAYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:24:26.224 --> 02:24:26.891
THEIR BILLING ALL THAT THEY

02:24:26.958 --> 02:24:29.627
CAN'T AND KEEPING TRACK SO AND

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:30.962
THAT'S WHEN YOU MENTION THE

02:24:31.029 --> 02:24:32.330
FORTY HOURS WHAT WE ARE DOING

02:24:32.397 --> 02:24:34.365
IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE TIME

02:24:34.432 --> 02:24:35.533
ESTIMATES FOR WHAT KINDS OF

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:37.568
CASES. BEARING IN MIND THAT

02:24:37.635 --> 02:24:38.703
THESE CASES DO VERY BECAUSE

02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:40.571
SOME CAN BE VERY QUICK SOMEONE

02:24:40.638 --> 02:24:41.506
IS EASY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:43.341
ISSUES SOME OF THEM HAVE A LOT

02:24:43.408 --> 02:24:45.343
AND TAKES A LOT LONGER TIME BUT

02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:46.944
TRYING TO MAYBE TEAR THOSE AND

02:24:47.011 --> 02:24:47.979
FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES TAKE

02:24:48.046 --> 02:24:52.850
LONGER. HOW MUCH TIME WE CAN

02:24:52.917 --> 02:24:58.322
ALLOCATE. TO THEN. REALLY BE

02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:59.424
ABLE TO MONITOR THE ANALYSTS.

02:24:59.490 --> 02:24:59.991
TO SEE LIKE IF YOU'RE REALLY

02:25:00.058 --> 02:25:01.325
TAKING TOO MUCH TIME FOR THIS

02:25:01.392 --> 02:25:02.794
OR THIS TYPE OF CASE. SO IT'S A

02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:03.628
IT'S A CONSTANT THEY HAVE A LOT

02:25:03.694 --> 02:25:04.595
OF CASES THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING

02:25:04.662 --> 02:25:07.198
IN AND OUT. AND AGAIN WE'RE

02:25:07.265 --> 02:25:07.832
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:25:07.899 --> 02:25:09.100
ALL THEIR TIME NOW SPENT

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:10.668
WORKING ON THOSE INVESTIGATIONS

02:25:10.735 --> 02:25:12.737
AND NOT HAVING ANY DOWNTIME. SO

02:25:12.804 --> 02:25:15.139
MY PRACTICE DAYS IT WAS CLOSURE

02:25:15.206 --> 02:25:15.606
I MEAN I DIDN'T FEEL

02:25:15.673 --> 02:25:16.607
COMFORTABLE BUILDING A

02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:17.875
CLIENTELE I'D FINISHED THE

02:25:17.942 --> 02:25:19.877
ENGAGEMENT RIGHT. UNLESS IT WAS

02:25:19.944 --> 02:25:21.045
LONG ENOUGH THAT I COULD DO

02:25:21.112 --> 02:25:23.081
PROGRESS BUILDINGS BUT- HOW DO

02:25:23.147 --> 02:25:25.116

02:25:52.643 --> 02:25:57.482

EMBARRASSING. I JUST. IT COULD

HOW DO WE DO IT HOW DO WE GET

02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:10.661
IT DONE. AND I THINK. THERE'S A

02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:12.363
ROOM THERE. FOR IMPROVEMENT. I

02:26:12.430 --> 02:26:14.031
THINK. I DON'T WANT TO ASK YOU

02:26:14.098 --> 02:26:14.632
ALL THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT I

02:26:14.699 --> 02:26:17.535
ASKED OF THE AUTHOR. CONTROLLER

SERRA OR IS IT. THE TWO OF YOU

OR YEAH I THINK THAT FALLS WITH

02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:31.048
ME IN TERMS OF THE BUREAU BUT

02:26:31.115 --> 02:26:31.949
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM AND

02:26:32.016 --> 02:26:33.184
FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WE DO SO

02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:34.118
I TAKE THAT REALLY SERIOUSLY

02:26:34.185 --> 02:26:35.586
AND I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE

02:26:35.653 --> 02:26:37.155

STAFFING IS SO WHAT IS YOUR

02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:21.052

FEEL LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:29:38.969 --> 02:29:41.372
WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW TO

02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:43.007
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CAUSES AND

02:29:43.074 --> 02:29:44.041
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT SHOULD BE

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:44.875
GIVEN THE YES FOR DIGITAL

02:29:44.942 --> 02:29:45.743
RESOURCES THREE YEARS AGO IN

02:29:45.810 --> 02:29:47.578
THIS COMMITTEE THE GAO

02:29:47.645 --> 02:29:48.679
COMMITTEE I SAT ON MY TALKED

02:29:48.746 --> 02:29:51.716
ABOUT IT IN RELATIONAL FUNDING

02:29:51.782 --> 02:29:52.883
FOR NATIONAL POSITIONS Là MY

02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:54.585

GIVE YOU FUNDING WE GAVE

02:29:55.586 --> 02:29:58.122
POSITIONS SO WHY IS A BACKLOG

ANSWER THAT YEAH I THINK AT THE

02:30:10.868 --> 02:30:12.737
TIME AGAIN WAS BEFORE MY TIME

02:30:12.803 --> 02:30:14.238
BUT I THINK THAT THEY THOUGHT

02:30:14.305 --> 02:30:15.239
THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL

02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:16.741
OF STAFFING TO GET THE JOB DONE

02:30:16.807 --> 02:30:19.143
AND AGAIN IT MAY HAVE BEEN A

02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:21.379
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN BUT WE'RE

02:30:21.445 --> 02:30:22.680
TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE KINDA

02:30:22.747 --> 02:30:23.114
IMPLEMENT ALL THOSE

02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:25.216
EFFICIENCIES AND FIGURE OUT IF

02:30:25.282 --> 02:30:28.753
THAT IS THE RIGHT. STAFFING

02:30:28.819 --> 02:30:29.353
NUMBER YOU GUYS ARE MAYBE NOT

02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:31.222
MAYBE I'VE HEARD YOU GUYS TO MY

02:30:31.288 --> 02:30:32.156
COLLEAGUES EACH CASE IS

02:30:32.223 --> 02:30:33.891
DIFFERENT OBVIOUSLY AND LONG

02:30:33.958 --> 02:30:34.792
FOR STILL BERKELEY CASEY MAY

02:30:34.859 --> 02:30:36.527
BE. A TWENTY MINUTE REPORT MAY

02:30:36.594 --> 02:30:37.962
BE A FOR OUR REPORT RIGHT

02:30:38.028 --> 02:30:39.330
DIPPING THE COMPLEXITIES OF

02:30:39.397 --> 02:30:40.097
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE A REALLY

02:30:40.164 --> 02:30:43.200
ADDRESS THAT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW

02:30:43.267 --> 02:30:44.568
A CASE IS NOT A CASE YOU CAN'T

02:30:44.635 --> 02:30:45.369
MISS IT OKAY HERE'S A CASE

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:47.738
APPLICATION TO TAKE FOUR HOURS.

02:30:47.805 --> 02:30:49.306
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE'S BACKGROUNDS

02:30:49.373 --> 02:31:01.018
A LOT. OF OTHER ISSUES. SO. I

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:02.253
GO ONCE YOU MOVE THE BACKLOG BE

02:31:02.319 --> 02:31:02.787
PROCESS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:31:02.853 --> 02:31:04.121
REDUCED. EXCEPT FOR SOME

02:31:04.188 --> 02:31:06.357
EXTREMELY COMPLICATED CASES. SO

02:31:06.424 --> 02:31:06.891
WHAT WHAT IS YOUR PLAN FOR

02:31:06.957 --> 02:31:09.627
DISNEY BACKLOGS IN WHEN. THE

02:31:09.693 --> 02:31:10.928
TWO MORE YEARS OR SO WE WHAT

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:12.029
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE SAYS

02:31:12.096 --> 02:31:14.131
IT'S THOSE TWO YEARS SO OUR

02:31:14.198 --> 02:31:14.765
STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE'RE GONNA

02:31:14.832 --> 02:31:15.366
BE SUBMITTED TO THE AUDITOR.

02:31:15.433 --> 02:31:16.734
FOR KIND OF KNOWING THAT WE

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:17.268
HAVE FUNDING FOR THOSE FOR

02:31:17.334 --> 02:31:18.269
THOSE ADDITIONAL I BELIEVE IT

02:31:18.335 --> 02:31:19.236
WAS THIRTY TWO POSITIONS THAT

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:22.239
WE GOT. AND SO I'M KIND OF

02:31:22.306 --> 02:31:23.207
WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THAT TO

02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:23.841
SEE HOW WE CAN GET RID OF THAT

02:31:23.908 --> 02:31:26.177
BACKLOG. I THINK THAT ONCE WE

02:31:26.243 --> 02:31:27.244
GET ALL OF OUR DAD IN PLACE TO

02:31:27.311 --> 02:31:28.078
HAE A BETTER IDEA OF. ON SHE

02:31:28.145 --> 02:31:29.046
HAVEN'T BASED ON NUMBERS TO

02:31:29.113 --> 02:31:31.182
TELL YOU THAT WHAT WE THINK IS

02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:32.249
REASONABLE IN TERMS OF

02:31:32.316 --> 02:31:34.418
ELIMINATING. THE BACKLOG. I

02:31:34.485 --> 02:31:35.319
FEEL LIKE THAT'S KIND OF PART

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:36.821
OF WHAT THE AUDITOR WANTED. TO

02:31:36.887 --> 02:31:38.622
DO TO IMPLEMENT SOME THINGS

02:31:38.689 --> 02:31:39.490
THAT TAKE A HARD LOOK AT OUR

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:42.960
NUMBERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:43.461
SOME REALISTIC. YOU KNOW

02:31:43.527 --> 02:31:44.061
PROJECTIONS ON WHEN WE CAN GET

02:31:44.128 --> 02:31:48.399
IT DONE. FOR JOHN AGO. THE

02:31:48.466 --> 02:31:49.967
AUDIT JUST IN THE BILLING

02:31:50.034 --> 02:31:50.935
RECORDS. THE OTHER THREE OR

02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:52.603
SCOPE. THE TROUBLE WITH

02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:53.070
ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE

02:31:53.137 --> 02:31:54.638
IMPROPERLY BUILT. ARE YOU GUYS

02:31:54.705 --> 02:31:57.341
PLAN ON GOING FOR THAT MATTER

02:31:57.408 --> 02:32:01.645
STOPPING AT THAT. I WASN'T I

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:03.180
DIDN'T CATCH THAT THE SO DOES

02:32:03.247 --> 02:32:04.048
THE BUREAU PLAN A REVIEWER

02:32:04.114 --> 02:32:07.051
AUDIT IS BILLING RECORDS YEARS

02:32:07.117 --> 02:32:07.618
BEYOND THE THREE YEAR FISCAL

02:32:07.685 --> 02:32:10.588
SCOPE OF THE STATE AUDIT. ARE

02:32:10.654 --> 02:32:11.522
YOUR FOR INTO THE SPECIAL

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:12.156
DISTRIBUTION FUND CORRECT DOES

02:32:12.223 --> 02:32:13.357
YES WE COULD ONLY GO BACK THREE

02:32:13.424 --> 02:32:14.859
YEARS SO WE WENT BACK BEFORE

02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:15.659
THE AUDITOR'S CAME AND WE HAD

02:32:15.726 --> 02:32:16.594
RECOGNIZE THAT WERE ALREADY

02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:18.229
STARTING TO IMPLEMENT THAT.

02:32:18.295 --> 02:32:19.997
THOSE PROCEDURES TO DO THAT

02:32:20.064 --> 02:32:22.766
RECONCILIATION KNOWING THAT AS

02:32:22.833 --> 02:32:25.669
WAS DAUGHTERS OFFICE EXPLAINED

02:32:25.736 --> 02:32:27.771
THAT WE DO HAVE FOLKS. AGENTS

02:32:27.838 --> 02:32:29.073
IN CERTAIN POSITION NUMBERS

02:32:29.139 --> 02:32:31.041
FUNDED BY DIFFERENT FUNDS THEY

02:32:31.108 --> 02:32:32.409
DO WORK ON BOTH CARDROOM IN

02:32:32.476 --> 02:32:34.111
TRIBAL IT WILL GO BACK AND

02:32:34.178 --> 02:32:34.879
FORTH IT MAY FLUCTUATE FROM

02:32:34.945 --> 02:32:37.214
YEAR TO YEAR SO WE REALIZE THAT

02:32:37.281 --> 02:32:38.449
WE NEED TO JUST KEEP TRACK OF

02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:40.117
INDIVIDUALS AND SO NEVER

02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:44.555
TRACKING. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

02:32:44.622 --> 02:32:45.155
THE TIME THAT THEY'RE SPENDING

02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:50.027
IN A PLACE. THAT HER POSITION

02:32:50.094 --> 02:32:51.028
ISN'T FUNDED FOR THAT WERE

02:32:51.095 --> 02:32:51.629
PUTTING THAT MONEY BACK WHERE

02:32:51.695 --> 02:32:52.863
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. SO WE HAD

02:32:52.930 --> 02:32:53.831
STARTED THAT PROCESS IN THE

02:32:53.898 --> 02:32:54.865
AUDITOR'S NOTICED IT TOO SO WE

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:56.267
HAD GONE BACK AND- DONE THOSE

02:32:56.333 --> 02:32:56.867
THREE YEARS SO THE LAST THREE

02:32:56.934 --> 02:32:59.003
FISCAL YEARS. OF THE MONEY WAS

02:32:59.069 --> 02:33:00.504
TRANSFERRED OVER INTO MY VERY

02:33:00.571 --> 02:33:02.206
FROM YEAR TO YEAR IT COULD BE

02:33:02.273 --> 02:33:03.874
THAT STF POSITIONS ARE SPENDING

02:33:03.941 --> 02:33:04.775
MORE TIME IN CARDS CARTER

02:33:04.842 --> 02:33:06.510
POSITIONS ARE MUCH. SO WE HAVE

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:07.811
TO THERE WAS NO EASY WAY TO DO

02:33:07.878 --> 02:33:09.613
IT IT SEEMS LIKE WE JUST NEEDED

02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:10.447
TO TRACK EVERY SINGLE PERSON

02:33:10.514 --> 02:33:13.050
AGENTS TIME. ALRIGHT AND FIGURE

02:33:13.117 --> 02:33:14.685
OUT WHERE THAT WHERE THE COST

02:33:14.752 --> 02:33:15.819
LAYS THE NOTE THE AUDITOR'S

02:33:15.886 --> 02:33:19.156
REPORT YOU HAVE A PATHWAY. TO

02:33:19.223 --> 02:33:20.858
GO FORWARD CORRECT AND REDUCES

02:33:20.925 --> 02:33:22.960
BACKLOG BUT I'M STILL GOING

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:24.194
BACK TO THAT POINT WHERE YOU

02:33:24.261 --> 02:33:25.362
RECEIVE THOSE ADDITIONAL

02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:26.430
POSITIONS. TWO YEARS AGO HOW

02:33:26.497 --> 02:33:28.365
MANY WAS IT THREE YEARS AGO. I

02:33:28.432 --> 02:33:30.734
THINK THERE WAS I BELIEVE IT

02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:33.604
WAS TWENTY EIGHT WAS THE LAST.

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:34.104
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE

02:33:34.171 --> 02:33:35.773
LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY TOOK IT

02:33:35.839 --> 02:33:37.141
UPON THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE

02:33:37.207 --> 02:33:38.976
THOSE TWENTY POSITIONS BECAUSE

02:33:39.043 --> 02:33:39.743
WE'VE HEARD COMPLAINTS FROM

02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:44.448
YOUR AGENCY. ABOUT STAFF AS WE

02:33:44.515 --> 02:33:50.588
GIVE YOU TWENTY POSITIONS. AN

02:33:50.654 --> 02:33:52.089
HOUR YOU GET A THIRTY TWO MORE

02:33:52.156 --> 02:33:53.490
SO I'M SEEING WHAT CONFIDENCE

02:33:53.557 --> 02:33:55.192
SHOULD I HAVE. THAT WE GOT A

02:33:55.259 --> 02:33:58.696
SWEET POSITIONS. YOU GUYS.

02:33:58.762 --> 02:34:02.199
DIDN'T REDUCE THE BACKLOG. SO

02:34:02.266 --> 02:34:03.000
WHY SELF CONFIDENCE HE NOW THAT

02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:03.567
YOU REDUCE THE BACKLOG RIGHT

02:34:03.634 --> 02:34:04.501
JUST TO CLARIFY SO WE'RE NOT

02:34:04.568 --> 02:34:06.670
GETTING ANY NEW POSITIONS THE

02:34:06.737 --> 02:34:07.237
TWENTY AS PART OF THE THIRTY

02:34:07.304 --> 02:34:07.838
TWO THAT WE FOR SECRET RIGHT

02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:08.439
WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH THEM.

02:34:08.505 --> 02:34:09.006
KIND OF OUR MEANS WHICH YOU

02:34:09.073 --> 02:34:09.473
PROVIDED TO US IN THE

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:10.040
CONFIDENCE I THINK HOPEFULLY

02:34:10.107 --> 02:34:10.674
WILL COME WHEN YOU SEE OUR PLAN

02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:12.009
AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT

02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:13.344
EACH CASE AND FIGURE OUT HOW

02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:14.778
WE'RE GOING TO. REDUCE THE

02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:17.081
BACKLOG IN THEM. HAPPY DISCUSS

02:34:17.147 --> 02:34:17.681
THAT WHEN WE GET THOSE DONE A

02:34:17.748 --> 02:34:19.083
WE ARE WORKING HARD ON GETTING

02:34:19.149 --> 02:34:21.418
THOSE NUMBERS IN PLACE SO WE

02:34:21.485 --> 02:34:22.620
CAN HAVE AGAIN. WE WANT TO I'M

02:34:22.686 --> 02:34:23.754
NOT MORE THAN ONE FOR THE BACK

02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:25.489
LIKE TO GO AWAY BUT I ALSO WANT

02:34:25.556 --> 02:34:27.291
TO BE A REALISTIC AND MAKE SURE

02:34:27.358 --> 02:34:28.325
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ARE JOB

INCONSISTENCIES BACKLOGS. AN

02:35:01.458 --> 02:35:04.261

EMBARRASSING. HOWEVER ONCE WE

THAT IN OUR PROCEDURES AND OUR

02:35:57.448 --> 02:35:58.649
PROCESSES THAT WE COULD ADDRESS

02:35:58.716 --> 02:36:00.684
AND ELIMINATE THEM SO WE ARE

02:36:00.751 --> 02:36:03.721
DOING THOSE IMMEDIATELY NOT

02:36:03.787 --> 02:36:05.522
JUST BECAUSE OF THE AUTO BUT IF

02:36:05.589 --> 02:36:06.356
THERE ARE PROBLEMS THERE WE

02:36:06.423 --> 02:36:08.125
WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM SO WE

02:36:08.192 --> 02:36:09.093

MANNER IN WHICH YOU HANDLE

02:36:29.613 --> 02:36:31.682
FUNDS OF THE OF THE FEES OF

THOSE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR YOUR-

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:37.254
OPERATION. THAT YOU ARE GETTING

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:40.858
VERY CLOSE TO AN UNLAWFUL TAX.

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:41.492
AT LISTENING TO WHAT THE AUTHOR

02:36:41.558 --> 02:36:43.827
DESCRIBED I DO UNDERSTAND I GET

02:36:43.894 --> 02:36:44.728
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEES

02:36:44.795 --> 02:36:47.064
AND TAXES AND I THINK THAT'S

02:36:47.131 --> 02:36:48.632
CERTAINLY WHAT THE COMMISSION

02:36:48.699 --> 02:36:49.299
AND THE BUREAU'S WORKING

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:52.069
TOGETHER TO AGAIN A LINE THOSE

02:36:52.136 --> 02:36:53.303
COST AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:55.806
ARE COVERING FEES COVERING FEES

02:36:55.873 --> 02:36:56.940
COVERING THINGS BUT THEY'RE

02:36:57.007 --> 02:36:58.442
SUPPOSED TO. I'M AND WE ALWAYS

02:36:58.509 --> 02:36:59.943
TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE BUCKETS

02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:01.512
WORDS WHERE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

02:37:01.578 --> 02:37:02.913
SERVICES SHOULD FALL INTO AND

02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:04.248
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:37:04.314 --> 02:37:05.215
APPROPRIATE FEE IS PAYING FOR

02:37:05.282 --> 02:37:08.252
THEM SO WE DON'T RUN. ANYWHERE

02:37:08.318 --> 02:37:11.088
CLOSE TO YOU KNOW AN ILLEGAL

02:37:11.155 --> 02:37:14.424
TAXES ENGINE. THAT. TO ME THE

02:37:14.491 --> 02:37:15.058
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:37:15.125 --> 02:37:19.363
A FEE AND- THEY TAX IS THE

02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:21.398
DIRECT NEXUS BETWEEN THOSE WHO

02:37:21.465 --> 02:37:21.932
PAY. AND THE SERVICES THEY

02:37:21.999 --> 02:37:25.669
PROVIDE. DO YOU NOT. CONCUR

02:37:25.736 --> 02:37:31.308
THAT SIGNIFICANT FEES PAID FOR

02:37:31.375 --> 02:37:31.842
PROCESSES THAT TAKE OVER A

02:37:31.909 --> 02:37:35.646
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. OUR

02:37:35.712 --> 02:37:37.047
CALLS INTO QUESTION THE NEXUS

02:37:37.114 --> 02:37:39.383
BETWEEN A FEE PAID BY AN

02:37:39.449 --> 02:37:39.983
APPLICANT AND YOUR ABILITY TO

02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:42.953
PERFORM. UP ON A TIMELY

02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:47.424
APPROVAL. SO THIS GETS TO MY

02:37:47.491 --> 02:37:50.661
DUE PROCESS QUESTION. SO THE

NEXUS WE'RE LOOKING AT KIND OF

02:37:52.963 --> 02:37:54.131
SEPARATELY JUST TO MAKE SURE

02:37:54.198 --> 02:37:56.066
THAT THE FEES SO WE CHARGE FOR

02:37:56.133 --> 02:37:58.235
INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THOSE ARE

02:37:58.302 --> 02:37:58.769
COVERED ALL INVESTIGATION

02:37:58.836 --> 02:38:01.538
BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE ANY OF

02:38:01.605 --> 02:38:02.673
THESE APPLICATION FEES AT THOSE

02:38:02.739 --> 02:38:05.209
ARE BEING DETERMINED BASED ON

02:38:05.275 --> 02:38:06.877
CERTAIN SERVICES THAT WE

02:38:06.944 --> 02:38:07.711
PROVIDE IN THOSE ARE GOING TO

02:38:07.778 --> 02:38:10.347
COVER THOSE COSTS. CERTAINLY

02:38:10.414 --> 02:38:12.749
THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS I

02:38:12.816 --> 02:38:13.283
FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF A

02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:14.918
SEPARATE MATTER IS SOMETHING

02:38:14.985 --> 02:38:19.957
THAT WE NEED TO. TO COMPLY WITH

02:38:20.023 --> 02:38:21.425
THAT BECAUSE I MEAN IT'S

02:38:21.491 --> 02:38:22.993
REQUIRED OF US OBVIOUSLY BUT

02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:24.361
ALSO WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP

02:38:24.428 --> 02:38:25.395
INDUSTRY WAITING THAT LONG WE

02:38:25.462 --> 02:38:26.330
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY GET

02:38:26.396 --> 02:38:28.699
IMPATIENT. RIGHTFULLY SO AND

02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:30.067
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS MATTER OF

02:38:30.133 --> 02:38:30.667
CATCH UP SO WE'RE REALLY GOING

02:38:30.734 --> 02:38:33.804
TO JUST. REALLY TRYING TO GET

02:38:33.871 --> 02:38:35.038
RID OF THAT BACKLOG SO WE CAN

02:38:35.105 --> 02:38:36.340
ALWAYS WE WON'T HAVE TO HAVE

02:38:36.406 --> 02:38:38.141
THIS DISCUSSION ALL THE TIME

02:38:38.208 --> 02:38:39.276
ABOUT THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS

02:38:39.343 --> 02:38:41.612
BECAUSE WE ARE MEDIAN IT. I'M

02:38:41.678 --> 02:38:42.212
NOT SURE IF THAT. ANSWERS YOUR

02:38:42.279 --> 02:38:46.683

PERFORMANCE AS A HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:38:47.384 --> 02:38:52.856
DAYS. HI I ACTUALLY THINK

02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:54.258
THAT'S SORT OF ARBITRARY THAT

02:38:54.324 --> 02:38:58.362
IS A HALF A YEAR. WHY CAN'T YOU

02:38:58.428 --> 02:39:01.365
GET IT DONE IN NINETY DAYS. WHY

02:39:01.431 --> 02:39:02.399
CAN'T YOU GET WHAT I MEAN

02:39:02.466 --> 02:39:06.136
HONESTLY I'M I'M- ABOUT. MY

02:39:06.203 --> 02:39:08.572
PRIVATE LIFE FOR THIRTY YEARS

02:39:08.639 --> 02:39:09.139
WAS IN BROADCASTING WE WENT

02:39:09.206 --> 02:39:09.573
THROUGH THE FEDERAL

02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:12.075

BACKGROUND CHECKS FEES ALL

02:39:12.876 --> 02:39:16.179
KINDS OF THINGS. AND QUITE

02:39:16.246 --> 02:39:18.682
FRANKLY THE FCC WAS MODERNIZED

02:39:18.749 --> 02:39:19.983
THE NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:20.517
COMMUNICATIONS ACT WAS NOT

02:39:20.584 --> 02:39:24.087
MODERNIZE TODAY. TODAY I CAN

02:39:24.154 --> 02:39:25.656
GET A LICENSE IN THIRTY DAYS

02:39:25.722 --> 02:39:26.156

02:39:26.223 --> 02:39:28.558
COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION WITH

02:39:30.294 --> 02:39:33.597
WITH STANDARDS OF UP FINANCE

02:39:33.664 --> 02:39:35.766
AND ALL OF THE THINGS NECESSARY

02:39:35.832 --> 02:39:38.302
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT IN THIS.

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:38.835
ARENA THAT THIRTY DAYS IS

02:39:38.902 --> 02:39:42.039
REALISTIC BUT CAN YOU CHALLENGE

02:39:42.105 --> 02:39:45.943
YOURSELF. AND BE WILLING TO

02:39:46.009 --> 02:39:49.112
MANAGE AN OPERATION. THAT CAN

02:39:49.179 --> 02:39:50.714
ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE AND

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:52.182
NINETY DAYS INSTEAD OF A

02:39:52.249 --> 02:39:53.617
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS WELL I

02:39:53.684 --> 02:39:55.485
WILL SAY THAT WERE THEN THE

02:39:55.552 --> 02:39:56.053
HUNDRED EIGHTIES COMES FROM

02:39:56.119 --> 02:39:57.921
REGULATIONS OF BANK STANLEY I

02:39:57.988 --> 02:39:58.922
WILL SAY THAT SOME MIGHT

02:39:58.989 --> 02:40:00.157
ACTUALLY THINK WE COULD GET IN

02:40:00.223 --> 02:40:02.059
THAT TIME FRAME IT'S JUST GOING

02:40:02.125 --> 02:40:03.627
TO DEPEND ON THE CASE SOME.

02:40:03.694 --> 02:40:05.362
SOME CASES LIKE WERE PERMITS

02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:06.563
TAKE A LOT LESS TIME THAN A

02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:09.700
CARD ROOM OWNERS CERTAINLY SO I

02:40:09.766 --> 02:40:11.101
DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT

02:40:11.168 --> 02:40:11.868
WE'RE GOING TO WAIT TO THE HUNT

02:40:11.935 --> 02:40:13.537
USE THE ENTIRE A HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:15.038
DAYS SHOULD WE BE ABLE TO GET

02:40:15.105 --> 02:40:18.508
THOSE OUT SOONER ABSOLUTELY I

02:40:18.575 --> 02:40:19.076
WOULD LIKE TO GET THOSE OUT

02:40:19.142 --> 02:40:23.246
IMMEDIATELY. SO I DON'T KNOW

02:40:23.313 --> 02:40:24.848
RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

02:40:24.915 --> 02:40:25.449
MAKE SURE WE GET IN COMPLIANCE

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:26.483
WITH. AND I THINK THE

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:28.251
FRUSTRATION HERE. IS TO SEE A

02:40:28.318 --> 02:40:30.854
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. IN THE

02:40:30.921 --> 02:40:32.622
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE

02:40:32.689 --> 02:40:34.424
WORKING ON. THIS HUNDRED AND

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:37.027
EIGHTY DAY. COMPLETION PROCESS

02:40:37.094 --> 02:40:37.661
AND THE MORE PEOPLE WE GIVE YOU

02:40:37.728 --> 02:40:40.130
THE SLOWER YOU ARE. THAT IS A

02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:44.935
VERY VERY CONCERNING. CRITICISM

02:40:45.002 --> 02:40:46.236
I THINK EVENT WHAT ONE FOR

02:40:46.303 --> 02:40:51.508
FINAL. I'M GONNA PUT MY MAYOR'S

02:40:51.575 --> 02:40:52.075
HAT BACK ON MAY FRESNO FOR.

02:40:52.142 --> 02:40:55.479
EIGHT YEARS DO YOU UNDERSTAND

02:40:55.545 --> 02:40:56.413
AND APPRECIATE THAT THE DELAYS

02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:02.019
THAT YOU CREATE. AT AND THE OF

02:41:02.085 --> 02:41:03.820
DELAYS INCONSISTENCIES THE

02:41:03.887 --> 02:41:04.354
BACKLOGS THE APPEARANCE OF

02:41:04.421 --> 02:41:07.958
UNFAIRNESS. HAS A DIRECT IMPACT

02:41:08.025 --> 02:41:11.895
ON THE GENERAL FUND OF. CITIES

02:41:11.962 --> 02:41:13.363
AND HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE

02:41:13.430 --> 02:41:15.832
EMPLOYABILITY OF LITERALLY

02:41:15.899 --> 02:41:17.434
HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF

02:41:17.501 --> 02:41:20.303
INDIVIDUALS DO YOU UNDERSTAND

02:41:20.370 --> 02:41:22.272
THE NECESSITY OF FAIRLY

02:41:22.339 --> 02:41:25.308
COMPLETING THE PROCESS. BECAUSE

02:41:25.375 --> 02:41:27.577
THE END RESULT IS SOMETHING

02:41:27.644 --> 02:41:29.379
VERY POSITIVE FOR OUR

02:41:29.446 --> 02:41:31.548
COMMUNITIES DO DO YOU

02:41:31.615 --> 02:41:32.049
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE A

02:41:32.115 --> 02:41:34.351
GATEKEEPER TO PROGRESS. I DO'S

02:41:34.418 --> 02:41:38.355
UNDERSTAND THAT. DOING THINGS

02:41:38.422 --> 02:41:41.191
FAIRLY IS IMPERATIVE TO ENSURE

02:41:41.258 --> 02:41:43.126
THAT EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL

02:41:43.193 --> 02:41:44.828
CHANCE TO WORK ON AND IN THE

02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:47.964
INDUSTRY MOST OF OUR SEASON ME

02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:48.999
UP TO HELP ME OUT BUT A LOT OF

02:41:49.066 --> 02:41:50.801
THE FOLKS SAID WE THE COMING

02:41:50.867 --> 02:41:53.203
FOR LICENSURE ARE ABLE TO WORK

02:41:53.270 --> 02:41:58.375
PENDING FULL LICENSURE SO. I

02:41:58.442 --> 02:41:59.543
DON'TWANT YOU THINK THAT'S AN

02:41:59.609 --> 02:42:00.877
EXCUSE BECAUSE WE STILL WANT TO

02:42:00.944 --> 02:42:02.479
GET THAT DONE BUT WE ARE AWARE

02:42:02.546 --> 02:42:04.114
THAT AND MINDFUL OF THE FACT

02:42:04.181 --> 02:42:05.682
THAT THOSE FOLKS CAN WORK WHAT

02:42:05.749 --> 02:42:06.583
DOESN'T WORK IS IF THEY HAVE

02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:07.884
BEEN WORKING FOR A LONG TIME

02:42:07.951 --> 02:42:09.252
AND THEN WE DO AN INVESTIGATION

02:42:09.319 --> 02:42:09.986
AND SOMETHING COMES OUT

02:42:10.053 --> 02:42:11.555
DEROGATORY TO HAVE TO REMOVE

02:42:11.621 --> 02:42:12.956
THAT. SO THAT'S WHY I THINK

02:42:13.023 --> 02:42:14.091
MAKING SURE THAT WE DO THINGS

02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:17.360
TIMELY IS SO THAT PEOPLE ARE IF

02:42:17.427 --> 02:42:18.028
THEY SHOULD BE AN INDUSTRY THEY

02:42:18.095 --> 02:42:19.196
SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE

02:42:19.262 --> 02:42:20.564
EXERCISE TENANTS CAN YOU GIVE

02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:22.532
ME SOME IDEA OF THE-

02:42:22.599 --> 02:42:24.768
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE- HIGH.

02:42:24.835 --> 02:42:27.771
AMOUNTS OF PROCESSING AND

02:42:27.838 --> 02:42:31.108
APPLICANTS YOU HAVE AND THE ALL

02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:31.741
MY GOODNESS HERE'S A CROOK THAT

02:42:31.808 --> 02:42:35.378
NEEDS TO BE. TAKEN OUT OF THIS

02:42:35.445 --> 02:42:36.413
PROCESS IS IT A LOT. IS IT

02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:39.182
ROUTINE AND REGULAR. OR IS IT

02:42:39.249 --> 02:42:40.350
AN EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE

02:42:40.417 --> 02:42:42.819
RULE. BECAUSE IT IS THE

02:42:42.886 --> 02:42:43.420
EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE

02:42:43.487 --> 02:42:45.889
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THAT

02:42:45.956 --> 02:42:48.758
YOU'RE YOU'RE FOCUSING. ON A

02:42:48.825 --> 02:42:50.026
MINORITY OF A PROBLEM THAT

02:42:50.093 --> 02:42:52.329
SLOWING DOWN A MAJORITY OF

02:42:52.395 --> 02:42:52.896
APPLICATIONS THAT'S MY BASIC

02:42:52.963 --> 02:42:56.867
CONCERN HOW. WIDE SPREAD IS

02:42:56.933 --> 02:43:01.338
THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

02:43:01.404 --> 02:43:01.872
WANT TO CALL IT A CRICKET

02:43:01.938 --> 02:43:02.439
ELEMENT OR OF ON LICENSABLE

02:43:02.506 --> 02:43:04.641
ELEMENT. MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN

02:43:04.708 --> 02:43:08.378
JUST THE OPPOSITE. HARD WORKING

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:10.247
PEOPLE IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA

02:43:10.313 --> 02:43:13.750
WITH VERY VERY GOOD OPERATIONS.

02:43:13.817 --> 02:43:14.751
WHO PAY THEIR TAXES TO THIS

02:43:14.818 --> 02:43:17.287
CITY DO IT RIGHT AND I ACTUALLY

02:43:17.354 --> 02:43:19.756
EXPAND. AND I'M TRYING TO

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:23.059
UNDERSTAND. IT'S ONE THING FOR

02:43:23.126 --> 02:43:28.098
THE SAFETY THE LEGAL CONCERNS.

02:43:28.165 --> 02:43:29.766
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

02:43:29.833 --> 02:43:31.468
ARE YOU MAJORING ON THE MINERS

02:43:31.535 --> 02:43:33.537
ARE MONITORING ON THE MAJORS

02:43:33.603 --> 02:43:34.838
YEAH AND I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE

02:43:34.905 --> 02:43:36.873
THE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE

02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:38.375
MAY AND MAKE THE COMMISSION

02:43:38.441 --> 02:43:40.644
MIGHT BUT IN TERMS OF OUR KIND

02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:43.980
OF DENIAL RECOMMENDATION RATE I

02:43:44.047 --> 02:43:45.048
JUST DON'T KNOW THAT SO I DON'T

02:43:45.115 --> 02:43:46.416
HAVE THE COMPARISON OF THE

02:43:46.483 --> 02:43:48.285
BUREAU'S TO NILE RECOMMENDATION

02:43:48.351 --> 02:43:49.886
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS

02:43:49.953 --> 02:43:52.322
APPROXIMATELY 1% OF THE

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:53.690
APPLICANTS THAT COME FORTH TO

02:43:53.757 --> 02:43:55.659
THE COMMISSION. ARE SENT TO AN

02:43:55.725 --> 02:43:57.827
EVIDENTIARY HEARING WHETHER

02:43:57.894 --> 02:43:59.095
THAT MEANS THE COMMISSION NEEDS

02:43:59.162 --> 02:44:00.430
MORE INFORMATION FO

02:44:00.497 --> 02:44:04.401
SUITABILITY OR AT THE END UP TO

02:44:04.467 --> 02:44:04.968
DIAL BUT LIKE STEPHANIE DID

02:44:05.035 --> 02:44:08.705
MENTION. ALL BUT THE OWNERS ARE

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:10.507
ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE INDUSTRY

02:44:10.574 --> 02:44:12.375
WITHIN A VERY REASONABLE TIME

02:44:12.442 --> 02:44:13.109
FRAME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO

02:44:13.176 --> 02:44:15.812
WEEKS MAYBE A MONTH. AND BEGIN

02:44:15.879 --> 02:44:17.647
WORKING WITHIN THE INDUSTRY

02:44:17.714 --> 02:44:18.848
DURING THAT TIME OF THE

02:44:18.915 --> 02:44:21.685
BACKGROUND PROCESS. AND IF AN

02:44:21.751 --> 02:44:24.287
EXAMPLE OF AN APPLICANT IS SENT

02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:26.423
TO AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. THEY

02:44:26.489 --> 02:44:27.891
ARE ALSO ISSUED IN TERMS

02:44:27.958 --> 02:44:30.227
LICENSE. IN WHICH THEY CAN

02:44:30.293 --> 02:44:32.629
CONTINUE ON WORKING IN ONE IN

02:44:32.696 --> 02:44:33.730
THE INDUSTRY UNTIL FINAL TYSON

02:44:33.797 --> 02:44:35.098
IS STILL I WANNA MAKE SURE I

02:44:35.165 --> 02:44:36.233
UNDERSTAND THIS IS 1% OF

02:44:36.299 --> 02:44:38.101
APPLICANTS ESSENTIALLY.

02:44:38.168 --> 02:44:39.970
ESSENTIALLY THAT IS A MINUSCULE

02:44:40.036 --> 02:44:43.006
NUMBER. AND YET IS TAKING YOU

02:44:43.073 --> 02:44:43.573
SIX MONTHS TO GET APPROVALS

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:48.111
DONE. I MEAN I HONESTLY I'M

02:44:48.178 --> 02:44:48.945
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I

02:44:49.012 --> 02:44:50.013
MEAN HOW MUCH HOW DIFFICULT IS

02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:53.183
IT. TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS TO

02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:55.252
PROCESS APPLICATIONS IF IN FACT

02:44:55.318 --> 02:44:58.588
YOU HAVE 1% THAT ARE FALLING

02:44:58.655 --> 02:45:00.223
INTO THE THIS DIFFICULT

02:45:00.290 --> 02:45:01.524
CATEGORY WHICH MEANS WHAT YOU

02:45:01.591 --> 02:45:05.962

02:45:06.029 --> 02:45:09.466
APPROVAL BALL AND ABLE TO FIND

THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION I'M

02:45:13.003 --> 02:45:13.536
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY DOES

02:45:13.603 --> 02:45:18.775
IT TAKE YOU. OVER HALF A YEAR.

02:45:18.842 --> 02:45:19.342
TO PROCESS WHAT SEEMS TO BE

02:45:19.409 --> 02:45:22.479
FAIRLY ROUTINE. INFORMATION

ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU FOR

02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:31.988
DEFAULTING ON THE SIDE OF

02:45:32.055 --> 02:45:34.858
SUSPICION. OP OR ARE YOU ARE OR

02:45:34.924 --> 02:45:37.727

BECAUSE I'M WONDERING IF THAT

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:54.577
INSTITUTIONAL BIAS IS SO

02:45:54.644 --> 02:45:57.814
CONCERNED OVER THE 1% THAT

02:45:57.881 --> 02:45:58.415
YOU'RE PENALIZING THE 99% BUT

02:45:58.481 --> 02:46:01.985
THESE DELAYED. APPROVALS THAT'S

02:46:02.052 --> 02:46:03.286
A CONCERN BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:46:10.994 --> 02:46:12.195
AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET PLACE

02:46:13.596 --> 02:46:15.131
THAT THAT'S A BIG CONCERN. FOR

02:46:15.198 --> 02:46:15.699
ME IN A MUCH BIGGER PICTURE

02:46:15.765 --> 02:46:18.868
THIS. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE

02:46:18.935 --> 02:46:23.139
DO. LIKE YOU MENTIONED

02:46:23.206 --> 02:46:24.240
CAREFULLY REVIEW EACH OF THESE

02:46:24.307 --> 02:46:26.176
CASES AND WE AS YOU SHOULD

02:46:26.242 --> 02:46:28.211
RIGHT AND WE ALSO THERE ARE

02:46:28.278 --> 02:46:29.346
CERTAIN AND I THINK THE AUDITOR

02:46:29.412 --> 02:46:30.246
BROUGHT IT UP THAT TO BE

02:46:30.313 --> 02:46:31.514
CONSISTENT THAT WE ASK THE SAME

02:46:31.581 --> 02:46:33.316
TYPES OF QUESTIONS SO WE

02:46:33.383 --> 02:46:34.317
CHECKED THE SAME DATABASES AND

02:46:34.384 --> 02:46:35.585
SOME TAKE LONGER THAN OTHERS

02:46:35.652 --> 02:46:37.220
MIGHT AGAIN BUT YOU THINK

02:46:37.287 --> 02:46:39.155
THEY'LL TAKE A HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:46:39.222 --> 02:46:39.756
DAYS SOME OF THAT CAN. HAPPEN

02:46:39.823 --> 02:46:44.461
ON A MORE ON IT. FOR BASIS BUT

02:46:44.527 --> 02:46:46.062
IT DEPENDS ON. I WAS AND I PUSH

02:46:46.129 --> 02:46:47.564
IT I DON'T I WANTED BUT- IF IN

02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:51.735
FACT. WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE THEN

02:46:51.801 --> 02:46:53.536
BOB BACKLOG SHOULD BE. REDUCED

02:46:53.603 --> 02:46:55.205
SUBSTANTIALLY AND YOU SHOULD BE

02:46:55.271 --> 02:46:57.040
A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE NO BACK

02:46:57.107 --> 02:46:59.809
BACKLOGS THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

02:46:59.876 --> 02:47:02.512

LEGALITY OF THIS IS IMPORTANT

02:47:19.562 --> 02:47:21.664

WHAT I THINK IS A IS A PROBLEM

02:47:31.241 --> 02:47:34.310
WITH DUE PROCESS. THAT THERE IS

02:47:34.377 --> 02:47:35.578
AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY PAY A

02:47:35.645 --> 02:47:36.980
FEE THEY ANSWER ALL THE

02:47:37.046 --> 02:47:38.715
QUESTIONS THAT A REASONABLE

02:47:38.782 --> 02:47:39.983

QUESTION HIS DIDN'T COME UP AND

IT WAS SOMETHING MENTIONED IN

02:50:26.683 --> 02:50:28.518
THE PREVIOUS PANEL ON THAT WAS

02:50:28.585 --> 02:50:31.254
HE OFTEN DOES A BUREAU AT TRACK

02:50:31.321 --> 02:50:34.324
THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS SINCE

02:50:34.390 --> 02:50:35.258
THEY SAID THERE WAS NO LOGS NO

02:50:35.325 --> 02:50:37.927
RECORDS. SEEMS KIND OF ODD TO

02:50:37.994 --> 02:50:39.629
BE WHY THERE WOULD BE NO RECORD

02:50:39.696 --> 02:50:42.498
OF THAT SO THE AND ARE TALKING

02:50:42.565 --> 02:50:44.200

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:45.234
AGENTS DO SO THEY DO TRACK ALL

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:47.136
THEIR TIME INTO TIME KEEPING

02:50:47.203 --> 02:50:49.205
SYSTEMS YOU KNOW ONE THAT TALKS

02:50:49.272 --> 02:50:50.306
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY

02:50:50.373 --> 02:50:52.208
DO WITH THEIR CASES AND THEN

02:50:52.275 --> 02:50:53.076
JUST WHAT THEY DO ON A DAILY

02:50:53.142 --> 02:50:55.945
BASIS WHAT THE AUDITOR LE

02:50:56.012 --> 02:50:57.213
STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE IT

02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:59.983
WASN'T CLEARLY LAID OUT HOW

02:51:00.049 --> 02:51:00.750
MUCH TIME THEY'RE SPENDING IN

02:51:00.817 --> 02:51:02.885
EACH CARDROOM TRIBAL CASINO.

02:51:02.952 --> 02:51:04.754
AND THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT

02:51:04.821 --> 02:51:08.925
THE SYSTEMS TRACK WHAT WE'RE

02:51:08.992 --> 02:51:09.525
DOING NOW IS ENSURING THAT ALL

02:51:09.592 --> 02:51:14.163
OF THE AGENTS. PLACE THERE WAS.

02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:15.331
PLACE THAT INFORMATION IN THE

02:51:15.398 --> 02:51:16.332
SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN. RUN HAVE

02:51:16.399 --> 02:51:16.966
TO MANUALLY PULL IT OUT I THINK

02:51:17.033 --> 02:51:17.600
IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD LIKE A

02:51:17.667 --> 02:51:18.701
SYSTEM OR WE COULD JUST PRESS

02:51:18.768 --> 02:51:20.136
THE BUTTON AND BE ABLE TO HAVE

WAS SPENT THERE. AND THE REASON

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:32.615
WHY OBVIOUSLY. BUT I THINK THAT

02:51:32.682 --> 02:51:34.050
WAS IT WAS WHEN THEY WENT BACK

02:51:34.117 --> 02:51:35.585
TO CHECK SPECIFICALLY FOR

02:51:35.652 --> 02:51:39.355
LOCATIONS IT WASN'T. CLEAR IN

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:39.856
ALL CASES GOT IT SO THE

02:51:39.922 --> 02:51:43.526
BUREAU'S LOOKING AT. BRING SOME

02:51:43.593 --> 02:51:44.994
CLARITY OR SOME. TRANSPARENCY

02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:45.628
IN THE LONG RUN WE'RE KIND OF

02:51:45.695 --> 02:51:46.729
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW JUST

02:51:46.796 --> 02:51:48.898
YOU. TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION

02:51:48.965 --> 02:51:50.366

02:51:50.433 --> 02:51:52.001
THE FUTURE WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:51:53.069 --> 02:51:54.637
GET THAT INFORMATION YOU KNOW.

02:51:54.704 --> 02:51:56.572
JUST WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON

02:51:56.639 --> 02:51:57.206
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WORKING

02:51:57.273 --> 02:51:58.207
TOWARDS AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE

02:51:58.274 --> 02:51:59.942
HAVE TO ADDRESS IT. SO THAT'LL

02:52:00.009 --> 02:52:01.811
BE OF SOMETHING WILL SAVE WITH

02:52:01.878 --> 02:52:02.645
THE CHECK INS WITH THE

02:52:02.712 --> 02:52:04.480
RECOMMENDATIONS. FOLLOWING

02:52:04.547 --> 02:52:06.382
THROUGH WITH THE AUDITOR'S

02:52:06.449 --> 02:52:06.949
RECOMMENDATIONS DOUBLE TO BE

02:52:07.016 --> 02:52:08.418
EITHER UPDATED ON OUR EFFORTS

02:52:08.484 --> 02:52:09.085
THERE. AND THEN IN THE PREVIOUS

02:52:09.152 --> 02:52:11.020
PANEL TO THE A TALK ABOUT. IT

02:52:11.087 --> 02:52:11.988
AND IT CAME UP JUST A LITTLE

02:52:12.055 --> 02:52:13.856
BIT BUT- WANTED YOU TO. KIND OF

02:52:13.923 --> 02:52:16.626
EXPAND ON THE CHARGES THAT WERE

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:17.326
BEING MADE TO THE SPECIAL

02:52:17.393 --> 02:52:21.931
DISTRIBUTION FIVE BABY. CHARGED

02:52:21.998 --> 02:52:25.401
TO ANOTHER FIND. AND THIS KIND

02:52:25.468 --> 02:52:26.502
OF GOES BACK TO THE WHOLE

02:52:26.569 --> 02:52:29.005
NOTION OF THE ALIGNMENT OF FEES.

02:52:29.072 --> 02:52:30.173
WHY IS THAT OCCURRING BECAUSE

02:52:30.239 --> 02:52:31.107
AND YOU SEE SOME ACCOUNTS THAT

02:52:31.174 --> 02:52:35.311
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FLUSH. AND IT

02:52:35.378 --> 02:52:37.346
IS TO BE LEADS TO A LOT OF

02:52:37.413 --> 02:52:37.847
CONFUSION OF TRYING TO

02:52:37.914 --> 02:52:38.915
UNDERSTAND THE FEES AND HOW

02:52:38.981 --> 02:52:40.850
THEY'RE BEING ALIGNED WITH THE

02:52:40.917 --> 02:52:42.418
REGULATORY COSTS RIGHT SO I

02:52:42.485 --> 02:52:43.986
THINK IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE BIT

02:52:44.053 --> 02:52:45.288
OF A TWO PART PROCESS PROBABLY

02:52:45.354 --> 02:52:46.055

THAT THOSE ARE ARE APPROPRIATE

02:52:54.564 --> 02:52:55.364
AND THEN LOOKING AT THE GALA

CONTROL FUND AND WITHIN THEIR

02:52:57.066 --> 02:52:59.302
WHICH FEES RELATE TO WHICH

02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:01.170
SERVICES SO I THINK IT'S

02:53:01.237 --> 02:53:02.438
SOMETHING THAT WHILE WE DO OUR

02:53:02.505 --> 02:53:04.307
COST ANALYSIS WE WILL HAVE TO

02:53:04.373 --> 02:53:06.542
CONSIDER AT NOT JUST WHAT TYPES

02:53:06.609 --> 02:53:08.344
OF FEES ARE BEING CHARGED FOR

02:53:08.411 --> 02:53:09.712

THAT. THE AUDIT DISCOVERED WITH

02:54:06.335 --> 02:54:07.837
RESPECT TO WHAT LOOKS LIKE A

02:54:07.904 --> 02:54:08.971
MORATORIUM THAT IS

02:54:09.038 --> 02:54:11.174
INTRINSICALLY UNFAIR AND JUST

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:12.241
TO CLARIFY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:54:12.308 --> 02:54:14.911
THEM AND MORE CHARMER WE

02:54:14.977 --> 02:54:15.711
TALKING ABOUT THE GAMES ISSUE

02:54:15.778 --> 02:54:18.514
THE GAME OR TORY IN THAT THAT

02:54:18.581 --> 02:54:19.649
IS REFERENCED IN THE AUDIT AND

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:22.518
THAT WAS PRESENTED IN TESTIMONY

02:54:22.585 --> 02:54:23.452
RIGHT SO IT'S THE GAME THE

02:54:23.519 --> 02:54:25.454
APPLICATION ISSUE IN TERMS OF

02:54:25.521 --> 02:54:27.056
WHEN GAME APPLICATIONS

02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:29.125

02:54:30.259 --> 02:54:31.360
THEM EITHER ISSUING APPROVALS

02:54:31.427 --> 02:54:32.995
ARE DENIALS SO THERE HAVE BEEN

02:54:33.062 --> 02:54:39.569
OTHER ISSUES THAT IT HELD SOME

02:54:39.635 --> 02:54:40.870
KIND OF EQUAL TREATMENT WE

02:54:40.937 --> 02:54:42.939
STARTED ISSUING THOSE SO AT THE

02:54:43.005 --> 02:54:45.074
END OF JULY WE I THINK WE SENT

02:54:45.141 --> 02:54:47.176
OUT A- TO TEMPORARY POOLS. TO

02:54:47.243 --> 02:54:48.010
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE WHEN KERR

02:54:48.077 --> 02:54:50.213
PLAYING GAMES TO BE ABLE TO

02:54:50.279 --> 02:54:51.214
ALLOW THOSE OTHER CARDROOM TO

02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:51.814
APPLY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO

02:54:51.881 --> 02:54:52.782
PLAY THEM TO AND THERE ARE SOME

02:54:52.849 --> 02:54:53.916
ADDITIONAL GAMES WERE WORKING

02:54:53.983 --> 02:54:59.922
THROUGH THAT PROCESS. TO

02:54:59.989 --> 02:55:00.456
ADDRESS EACH OF THEM BUT I

02:55:00.523 --> 02:55:05.027
DON'T. PROVIDING IT BACK TO THE

02:55:05.094 --> 02:55:06.562
AUDITOR ON THAT BUT YES WE HAVE

02:55:06.629 --> 02:55:07.930
STARTED GOING THROUGH THAT

02:55:07.997 --> 02:55:08.464
PROCESS OF ISSUING THOSE

02:55:08.531 --> 02:55:10.700
GADGETS IT IT SEEMS LIKE A

02:55:10.766 --> 02:55:11.267
MORATORIUM FREEZES IN PLACE

02:55:11.334 --> 02:55:12.869
INEQUITIES. AND THE AND THE

02:55:12.935 --> 02:55:13.469
SOONER YOU GET THROUGH THAT I

02:55:13.536 --> 02:55:18.307
MEAN IF ONE. APPLICANT GETS TO

DO ACCENT ANOTHER GETS TO DO X.

02:55:19.508 --> 02:55:20.576
MINUS WHY THAT'S OF THAT'S-

02:55:20.643 --> 02:55:21.310
INTRINSICALLY UNFAIR. AND IT

02:55:21.377 --> 02:55:21.944
SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU NEED TO

02:55:22.011 --> 02:55:24.280
GET TO A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE

02:55:24.347 --> 02:55:27.216
IS EQUAL BEFORE THE PROCESS. AT

02:55:27.283 --> 02:55:29.886
IS ADJUDICATED AND JUDGED UPON

02:55:29.952 --> 02:55:32.622
THAT FAIR PLAYING FIELD AND NOT

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:34.824
UNNECESSARILY PENALIZED BECAUSE

02:55:34.891 --> 02:55:36.659
THEY HAPPEN TO FALL IN. THE

02:55:36.726 --> 02:55:41.130
MORATORIUM. OPPOSITION AND

02:55:41.197 --> 02:55:42.932
OTHERS ARE OUTSIDE OF THAT

02:55:42.999 --> 02:55:43.466
POSITION THAT SEEMS TO BE

02:55:43.532 --> 02:55:45.368
INTRINSICALLY UNFAIR. I THINK

02:55:45.434 --> 02:55:46.402
IT'S JUST THE FRUSTRATION OF

02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:48.337
KNOWING SOME ADVOCATES GETTING

02:55:48.404 --> 02:55:49.739

02:55:49.805 --> 02:55:51.440
EIGHTY DAYS SOME WORDS TAKING

02:55:51.507 --> 02:55:52.875
SEVERAL YEARS WERE THAT IT

02:55:52.942 --> 02:55:55.311

THE BACKLOG OF THAT WAS THE

03:11:40.155 --> 03:11:43.058
DISCUSSIONS WILL EARLIER. BUT

03:11:43.124 --> 03:11:43.425

BACKLOGS AND THE RAMIFICATIONS

03:12:00.175 --> 03:12:04.179
ON THE PARTICULAR CLUBS. OUR

03:12:04.246 --> 03:12:06.581
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND AFFECTS

03:12:06.648 --> 03:12:11.119
A LOT OF LIVES I MEAN. I THINK

03:12:11.186 --> 03:12:12.787
THE AUDITOR'S DID A EXCELLENT

03:12:12.854 --> 03:12:16.391
JOB THEY HIT IT HEAD ON ALL

03:12:16.458 --> 03:12:19.794
EVERYTHING IS A 100% CORRECT.

03:12:19.861 --> 03:12:20.662
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S

03:12:20.729 --> 03:12:21.196
ANYTHING THAT'S NOT IN THE

03:12:21.263 --> 03:12:23.131
AUDIT REPORT THAT WILL HELP. I

03:12:23.198 --> 03:12:26.735
WOULD PROBABLY BE. HELPFUL AS

03:12:26.801 --> 03:12:28.703
WELL OR DO YOU THINK THE AUDIT

03:12:28.770 --> 03:12:31.406
WAS THOROUGH ENOUGH THAT IT. IT

03:12:31.473 --> 03:12:32.474
OUTLINED A LOT OF

03:12:32.540 --> 03:12:34.943
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE I THINK IT

03:12:35.010 --> 03:12:35.577
OUTLINED MYSELF PERSON HE'S OUR

03:12:35.644 --> 03:12:39.848
OWN. A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS BUT

03:12:39.915 --> 03:12:43.385
I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.

03:12:43.451 --> 03:12:44.686
BEING A BUSINESS OWNER MY

03:12:44.753 --> 03:12:50.792
ENTIRE LIFE IS EFFICIENCY. AND

03:12:50.859 --> 03:12:51.426
YOU CAN TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF

03:12:51.493 --> 03:12:54.763
PEOPLE. AND YOU CAN MAKE THEM

03:12:54.829 --> 03:12:58.500
EFFICIENT AND PROBABLY TRIPLE

03:12:58.566 --> 03:13:00.435
WHAT GETS DONE WITH PROCEDURES

03:13:00.502 --> 03:13:03.972
AND POLICIES. BUT SOMEBODY HAS

03:13:04.039 --> 03:13:06.574
TO OVERSEE IT BECAUSE WHEN YOU

03:13:06.641 --> 03:13:09.010
LAY DOWN THINGS TO BE DONE YOU

03:13:09.077 --> 03:13:10.979
GO BACK IN TWO WEEKS IT CHANGES

03:13:11.046 --> 03:13:14.215
SOMEHOW. SO SOMEBODY HAS TO BE

03:13:14.282 --> 03:13:16.217
ON IT ALL THE TIME BUT I THINK

03:13:16.284 --> 03:13:17.752
EFFICIENCY IS THE BIGGEST

03:13:17.819 --> 03:13:19.254
PROBLEM YEAH AND I THINK THERE

03:13:19.321 --> 03:13:20.255
WAS A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM

03:13:20.322 --> 03:13:22.457
LEGISLATORS A UP HERE CONNECT

03:13:22.524 --> 03:13:23.925
GEARING TOWARDS THE EFFICIENCY

03:13:23.992 --> 03:13:25.694
AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:28.496
TRANSPARENCY. WITH MOVING

03:13:28.563 --> 03:13:30.332
THROUGH PLACE YOU'RE GONNA

03:13:30.398 --> 03:13:33.368
MENTION KYLE KIRK ON I WOULD

03:13:33.435 --> 03:13:34.135
SAY THAT OF THAT OUR MEMBERSHIP

03:13:34.202 --> 03:13:36.805
IN THE CGA WE CERTAINLY HERE A

03:13:36.871 --> 03:13:38.039
LOT OF THAT THE TYPES OF THINGS

03:13:38.106 --> 03:13:38.573
THAT THE AUTHORS MENTIONED

03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:39.774
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE BEEN

03:13:39.841 --> 03:13:41.076
CITED EVERYONE OF THEIR-

03:13:41.142 --> 03:13:42.711
APPLICATIONS I CAN TELL YOU

03:13:42.777 --> 03:13:44.679
FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

03:13:44.746 --> 03:13:45.914
SOME OF THOSE THINGS WERE

03:13:45.981 --> 03:13:48.350
CONSISTENT. I SAY OF THE

03:13:48.416 --> 03:13:50.418
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE AUDIT.

03:13:50.485 --> 03:13:52.420
IS CERTAINLY A GREAT START BUT

03:13:52.487 --> 03:13:54.489
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AND I

03:13:54.556 --> 03:13:55.724
THINK ONE OF THE AUTHORS

03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:56.925
REFERENCE TUTOR COMMITTEE

03:13:56.992 --> 03:13:58.393

03:13:58.460 --> 03:13:59.828
WAS THE OPPORTUNITY LOOK FOR

03:13:59.894 --> 03:14:01.596
BEST PRACTICES ANOTHER SORT OF

03:14:01.663 --> 03:14:02.697
LICENSING AGENCIES WHERE

03:14:02.764 --> 03:14:03.832
THERE'S THE DEPARTMENT. OF

03:14:03.898 --> 03:14:06.835

PERFORMANCE. I'D LIKE TO SEE

03:14:21.716 --> 03:14:23.618

03:14:23.685 --> 03:14:24.853

FOR NEXT YEAR AND THE

03:15:19.574 --> 03:15:22.243

FUNDING OF ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL

03:15:38.626 --> 03:15:41.329
DESPITE THE SURPLUS IN THE

03:15:41.396 --> 03:15:42.931
GAMBLING FINE IN THE FACT THAT

STILL A BACKLOG SO DO YOU GUYS

03:15:47.268 --> 03:15:49.237
SUPPORT. THE CONTINUATION OF

03:15:49.304 --> 03:15:51.639
THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS

03:15:51.706 --> 03:15:56.177
DESPITE NOT ACHIEVING. AGO ARE

03:15:56.244 --> 03:15:56.744
GETTING THE BACKLOG REDUCE I

SHOULD SAY. WELL I THINK THAT

03:16:00.915 --> 03:16:01.916
IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG

03:16:01.983 --> 03:16:02.517
THEY'RE GONNA NEED THE BODIES

03:16:02.584 --> 03:16:03.618
TO GET THAT DONE AND AS WE

03:16:03.685 --> 03:16:04.719
TALKED ABOUT TODAY GETTING THAT

03:16:04.786 --> 03:16:05.854
DONE AND GETTING THESE PEOPLE

03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:07.655
LICENSES CRITICAL NOT ONLY TO

03:16:07.722 --> 03:16:08.690
THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES BUT

03:16:08.756 --> 03:16:10.558
THE CITIES THEY SUPPORT. SO I

03:16:10.625 --> 03:16:11.826
THINK PART OF THAT PROCESS IS

03:16:11.893 --> 03:16:13.361
ALLOWING THEM TO CLEAR THAT

03:16:13.428 --> 03:16:15.864
BACKLOG I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR

03:16:15.930 --> 03:16:16.998
COMMENTS EARLIER TODAY BY

03:16:17.065 --> 03:16:18.900
MISSION MAZU THAT ONE OF THE

03:16:18.967 --> 03:16:20.268
THINGS ARE LOOKING AT IS NOT

03:16:20.335 --> 03:16:21.636
JUST HOW LONG IT TAKES TO DO

03:16:21.703 --> 03:16:22.770
WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING.

03:16:22.837 --> 03:16:24.439

MEANINGFUL TO DETERMINE

03:16:28.576 --> 03:16:31.146
SUITABILITY. SO I THINK ONCE

03:16:31.212 --> 03:16:32.480
ONCE THEY WORK MAY BE GIVEN AN

03:16:32.547 --> 03:16:33.448
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THROUGH

03:16:33.515 --> 03:16:35.650
THAT PROCESS AND CONTINUE THE

03:16:35.717 --> 03:16:36.451
WORK THEY'RE DOING WILL BE A

03:16:36.518 --> 03:16:38.653
GOOD TIME TO RE EVALUATE. WHAT

03:16:38.720 --> 03:16:40.688

LIKE TO GET A CHANCE TO USE THE

03:17:05.747 --> 03:17:09.217
RESOURCES. INTO BENEFIT THE

03:17:09.284 --> 03:17:13.154
INDUSTRY WHILE THEY HAVE A.

03:17:13.221 --> 03:17:13.755
WEEDING CORROSION TO CONTINUE

03:17:13.821 --> 03:17:18.626
THAT. YOU'RE ENCOURAGED TO

03:17:18.693 --> 03:17:19.561
CONTINUE FUNDING ON THOSE

03:17:19.627 --> 03:17:22.463
POSITIONS DESPITE TO SURPLUS

03:17:22.530 --> 03:17:24.199
WOULD JUST BE WORLD SHE WOULD

03:17:24.265 --> 03:17:25.333
DIRECT SOME OF THOSE FUNDS TO

03:17:25.400 --> 03:17:26.868
DO SO I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY

03:17:26.935 --> 03:17:28.903
THIS AND WE'RE NOT REALLY IN A

03:17:28.970 --> 03:17:29.871
POSITION TO POINT TO THAT I DO

03:17:29.938 --> 03:17:31.272
THINK THE HAVING A LOOK AT

03:17:31.339 --> 03:17:32.240
WHERE THE FILE ON THE FEES ARE

03:17:32.307 --> 03:17:33.341
AND WHERE THE COSTS ARE GETTING

03:17:33.408 --> 03:17:37.378
THIS MORNING ALIGNMENT WERE A

03:17:37.445 --> 03:17:37.979
100% IN SUPPORT OF THAT WOULD

03:17:38.046 --> 03:17:42.217
LIKE TO SEE IT AS WELL. MAN TO

03:17:42.283 --> 03:17:43.851
THE QUESTIONS WELL. I DON'T

03:17:43.918 --> 03:17:46.254
SUPPORT GIVING THEM MORE MONEY

03:17:46.321 --> 03:17:46.788
I MEAN YOU DON'T REWARD AN

03:17:46.854 --> 03:17:47.355
ORGANIZATION FOR NOT GETTING

03:17:47.422 --> 03:17:48.823
THE JOB DONE. IF THEY'RE NOT

03:17:48.890 --> 03:17:50.058
HANDLING NOW THEY'VE HAD A

03:17:50.124 --> 03:17:50.658
COUPLE YEARS TO GET THIS DONE

03:17:50.725 --> 03:17:52.260
SO IF THEY CAN HANDLE I SUGGEST

03:17:52.327 --> 03:17:53.094
MOVING IT TO A DIFFERENT

03:17:53.161 --> 03:17:55.096
ORGANIZATION. IT'S OBVIOUS IN

03:17:55.163 --> 03:17:56.898
THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. I THINK A

03:17:56.965 --> 03:17:58.933
ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WOULD DO A

03:17:59.000 --> 03:17:59.801
BETTER JOB WITH THIS SO THAT'S

03:17:59.867 --> 03:18:01.436
MY SUGGESTION. GOD I FEEL

03:18:01.502 --> 03:18:04.138
WITHOUT. ALL THE POLICIES THAT

03:18:04.205 --> 03:18:05.707
HAVE TO BE CHANGED AND TO MAKE

03:18:05.773 --> 03:18:06.174
IT THE OPERATION MORE

03:18:06.241 --> 03:18:08.409
EFFICIENT. FOR PEOPLE COMING

03:18:08.476 --> 03:18:10.478
IN. YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST

03:18:10.545 --> 03:18:13.781
BRING IN MORE PEOPLE. ON THE

03:18:13.848 --> 03:18:16.084
SAME POLICIES AYE AYE I COULD

03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:18.553
SEE GIVING FUNDING FOR MORE

03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:21.489
PEOPLE ONCE ALL THE PROCESSES

03:18:21.556 --> 03:18:24.926
AND PROCEDURES ARE IN PLACE AND

03:18:24.993 --> 03:18:27.595
THEN YOU SEE IT OPERATING GREAT

03:18:27.662 --> 03:18:29.364
NOW YOU CAN BRING IN A FEW MORE

03:18:29.430 --> 03:18:32.400
PEOPLE. TRAINED THEM PUT THEM

03:18:32.467 --> 03:18:33.701
IN WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE AND

03:18:33.768 --> 03:18:37.105
THEN MOVE FORWARD BUT TO BRING

03:18:37.171 --> 03:18:40.041
A MAN NOW. THE END OF THAT

03:18:40.108 --> 03:18:43.845
WOULD BE NO HELP AT ALL. THANK

03:18:43.911 --> 03:18:44.979
YOU YEAH NO I THINK THAT WAS

03:18:45.046 --> 03:18:45.580
SOME OF THE DISCUSSION EARLIER

03:18:45.647 --> 03:18:46.581
TO WRITE WAS THE EFFICIENCY.

03:18:46.648 --> 03:18:47.115
AND ARE WE SHOWING THAT

03:18:47.181 --> 03:18:49.017
EFFICIENCY AND I KNOW WILD I

03:18:49.083 --> 03:18:50.385
KNOW THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN

03:18:50.451 --> 03:18:52.620
ONE OF. THE GRASS IN THE AUDIT

03:18:52.687 --> 03:18:55.523
WAS BRINGING ADDITIONAL.

03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:56.824
INDIVIDUALS ON BOARD BUT NOT

03:18:56.891 --> 03:18:58.860
SEEING A GREAT REDUCTION IN. AN

03:18:58.926 --> 03:19:01.062
ACTUAL CASE LOADS. AND NOT

03:19:01.129 --> 03:19:02.463
SEEING THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

03:19:02.530 --> 03:19:04.832
BILLABLE HOURS. SO WE'LL KEEP

03:19:04.899 --> 03:19:05.900
THAT IN MIND MOVING FORWARD

03:19:05.967 --> 03:19:07.335
WITH THAT I DO WANT TO MOVE TO

03:19:07.402 --> 03:19:08.836
SOUTHERN MOROCCO AS A QUESTION

THAT YOU ARE TO REFUND. WELL

03:19:21.215 --> 03:19:26.487

03:19:26.554 --> 03:19:28.456
DOWN WHERE A REFUND WOULD COME

03:19:28.523 --> 03:19:31.059
FROM BECAUSE EVERY PARTICULAR

03:19:31.125 --> 03:19:33.061
CLUB STARTED KYLE DIDN'T MEAN

03:19:33.127 --> 03:19:34.595
TO INTERRUPT MU BUT YOU TURN IN

03:19:34.662 --> 03:19:37.699
SO MANY FORMS AND PAPERS OVER

03:19:37.765 --> 03:19:39.400
THE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE CARD

03:19:39.467 --> 03:19:41.369
ROOM BUSINESS IN SACRAMENTO FOR

03:19:41.436 --> 03:19:44.038
TWENTY SEVEN HERE'S AN AD I

FOR REFUND. HAD HOW ABOUT IT

03:19:50.978 --> 03:19:55.149
THE REDUCTION GOING FORWARD.

WELL IT IT I MEAN THAT WOULD

03:19:57.051 --> 03:19:59.821
HELP BUT IF IT WOULD HELP. I

03:19:59.887 --> 03:20:01.522
WOULD DECLINE MY REFUND OR

03:20:01.589 --> 03:20:05.493
LOWER PRICES IF THE EFFICIENCY

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:07.895
AND THE JOB WAS DONE THAT

03:20:07.962 --> 03:20:10.565
NEEDED TO BE DONE I DON'T WANT

03:20:10.631 --> 03:20:13.801
TO CUT ANYTHING BACK AND HAVE

03:20:13.868 --> 03:20:14.836
IT GO BACKWARDS BECAUSE OF

03:20:14.902 --> 03:20:17.071
FUNDING. SO THEN IN THAT REGARD

03:20:17.138 --> 03:20:17.839
WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON

03:20:17.905 --> 03:20:20.208

HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT

03:20:32.420 --> 03:20:34.822
BECAUSE HE HAS A CARD ROOM IN

03:20:34.889 --> 03:20:37.191
WATSONVILLE THAT TWO PM FOR

03:20:37.258 --> 03:20:42.497
YEARS TO GET A LICENSE. AND I

03:20:42.563 --> 03:20:43.097
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE QUESTIONS

WERE. MY GOD JUST DON'T TALK

03:20:48.903 --> 03:20:49.804
ABOUT TWO THINGS ONE ON A IN

03:20:49.871 --> 03:20:52.807
GOING THROUGH THE AUDIT AND

03:20:52.874 --> 03:20:53.574
SEEING SOME OF THE THINGS ARE

03:20:53.641 --> 03:20:54.208
BROUGHT UP UNSERVED TIMING IN

03:20:54.275 --> 03:20:55.510
PROCESS OR WHATEVER REFLECTING

03:20:55.576 --> 03:20:57.044
ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE. I WOULD

03:20:57.111 --> 03:20:57.879
SAY THAT THERE YOU KNOW WE

03:20:57.945 --> 03:20:59.480
SOUGHT WAR OR DIFFERENT AUTHORS

03:20:59.547 --> 03:21:00.281
TO ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THE

03:21:00.348 --> 03:21:02.350
PROCESS WASN'T NESTLE SAME NOW

03:21:02.417 --> 03:21:03.851
EVERY APPLICATION WE HAD IS

03:21:03.918 --> 03:21:05.219
DIFFERENT RIGHT IN EVERY

03:21:05.286 --> 03:21:06.421
COURTROOM IN JURISDICTIONS A

03:21:06.487 --> 03:21:07.655
DIFFERENT ORDINANCE AND WHAT

03:21:07.722 --> 03:21:09.290
HAVE YOU SO THERE ARE

03:21:09.357 --> 03:21:11.492
DIFFERENCES. BUT WASN'T REALLY

03:21:11.559 --> 03:21:12.794
CLEAR THAT THERE IS SORT OF A

03:21:12.860 --> 03:21:14.429
CHECKLIST OF A PROCESS TO GO

03:21:14.495 --> 03:21:16.497
THROUGH THAT HAS CHANGED OVER

03:21:16.564 --> 03:21:18.232
TIME I'VE BEEN LICENSE FOR OVER

03:21:18.299 --> 03:21:19.600
A DECADE NOW SO THE PROCESS IS

03:21:19.667 --> 03:21:21.736
CHANGED A LITTLE BIT. BUT IN

03:21:21.803 --> 03:21:23.304
TERMS OF CONSISTENCY OF

03:21:23.371 --> 03:21:25.039
QUESTIONS WHAT WAS ASKED

03:21:25.106 --> 03:21:26.407
MATERIALS PROVIDED CERTAINLY

03:21:26.474 --> 03:21:28.075
APPLICATION WAS CONSISTENT BUT

03:21:28.142 --> 03:21:31.045
THEN THE FOLLOW ON WORK THAT

03:21:31.112 --> 03:21:34.015
WAS DONE AFTER THAT BY THE I'M

03:21:34.081 --> 03:21:35.149
COUNTY INVESTIGATOR THAT THE

03:21:35.216 --> 03:21:36.851
PERSON WORKING THE FILE. WAS

03:21:36.918 --> 03:21:37.985
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT AND IT

03:21:38.052 --> 03:21:40.488
WASN'T CLEAR AT ALL HOW IT WAS

03:21:40.555 --> 03:21:41.956
ON THE TIME FOR TO WORK THROUGH

03:21:42.023 --> 03:21:43.758
THE PROCESS IS CERTAINLY. IN IN

03:21:43.825 --> 03:21:45.726
MY EXPERIENCE DIDN'T FOLLOW ANY

03:21:45.793 --> 03:21:49.530
KIND OF PRESCRIBED DEADLINES SO

03:21:49.597 --> 03:21:51.699
IT'S A UNIT TO JUST WE

FOR SO SOME OF THAT FALLS ON

03:22:08.449 --> 03:22:10.117
THE INDUSTRY AS WELL BUT FROM

03:22:10.184 --> 03:22:12.420

PREDICTABILITY AND ALL THAT

03:22:18.659 --> 03:22:21.028
LACK OF PREDICTABILITY

03:22:21.095 --> 03:22:22.730
DEFINITELY HINDERS SOMEONE'S

03:22:22.797 --> 03:22:25.032
WILLINGNESS TO GO FORTH AND ONE

03:22:25.099 --> 03:22:27.969
