THIS BILL ESTABLISHES AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES TO FACILITATE THE CONVERSION OF MUNICIPALLY OWNED GOLF COURSES INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OPEN SPACE. THE HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT ARENA NUMBERS IN DISCIPLE ARE VERY SCARY IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WHERE THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL SPACE TO BUILD HOUSING. I'LL BE BRIEF ACTUALLY- THIS BILLIS PERMISSIVE IT DOES NOT MANDATE THAT ANYONE NEEDS TO DO ANY COMMUNITY NEEDS TO DO ANYTHING OR ANYTHING CONVERT THEIR GOLF COURSES BUT FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WERE ALL WE HAVE LEFT OUR- BROWNFIELDS OR GOLFERS IS TO LOOK AT IT ALLOWS US TO HAVE AN ENGAGE IN. ENERGY TO THE SIDE OF THIS IS THE BEST USE OF OUR LAND USE UP THERE ARE NOT AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL TODAY BUT I HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS- TO NARROW THIS BILL. I TO COMMUNITIES WHERE SENSE AT THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION FOR EVERYONE SO WE'RE LOOKING TO LIMITED IN AREAS WITH CERTAIN POPULATION DENSITIES. WE'RE LOOKING AT TO LOOK AT- TO LIMIT. GOLF COURSES THAT ARE UNDER UTILIZED- AND THOSE DETAILS ARE TO BE DETERMINED BASED ON ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS AND LIMITED TO AREAS THAT ARE ALSO CONSIDER PARK POOR WE WANT TO OPEN UP THE SEASON FOR BOTH HOUSING AND REAL OPEN SPACE THAT. CAN STOP AND DOES NOT HAVE A FEE TO ENTER OUT THERE.

VOTE THANK YOU. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JORDAN PUT ON A KIND OF A HOT. LET'S HAVE ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA BE HERE TO SUPPORT TALK IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN TEN. CALIFORNIA ME THE STATE WHERE DECISION OF OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND NEIGHBORS. THAT THEY CAN TO MAKE OUR SAY AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE WORK AND RAISE A FAMILY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE MOST RECENT STATEWIDE HOUSING ASSESSMENT THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT HOUSING COMMITTEE BELLAMY. ASM. YOU NEED FOR HOUSING FIRST HERE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HOUSING PRODUCTION AVERAGED FEWER THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND NEWS HOMES EACH YEAR AND ONGOING PRODUCTION CONTINUES. TO BE FAR FAR FAR BELOW THE PROJECT IN THE TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. THE COMBINATION OF HOUSING SHORTAGE IN THE RISING RENT BECAUSE CREATES INEQUALITY IT LIMITS OPPORTUNITIES FOR MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO FIND A HOME. AB NINETEEN TEN WOULD TRUST THE HOUSING SHORTAGE BY SALVAGING A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL AGENCIES THAT WANT TO COME VERY GOLF COURSE ON. BY THE LOCAL AGENCY INTO HOUSING A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE OPEN SPACE. THIS BILL TAKE A ONE STEP CLOSER TO ADDRESSING THE HOUSING SHORTAGE. BY EXPANDING THE AVENUES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES. I WOULD HIGHLIGHTED THIS PROGRAM IS VOLUNTARY AND IS AT THE DISCRETION OF EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE HOW OR EVEN IF TO USE THIS NEW TOOL. THIS BILL WILL NOT MANDATE ANY LOCAL ENTITIES IT SIMPLY GIVES THEM ANOTHER TOOL TO BUILD MORE HOMES. CALIFORNIA IS BEHIND SCHEDULE IN BUILDING MORE HOMES AND WE BELIEVE THIS BILL. COULD BE ONE OF THE SOLUTION TO GET US BACK ON TRACK. WE RESPECT YOUR QUESTION YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI NINETEEN TEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M SHOWING DRAKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION AND THE COMMISSION ALSO SUPPORTS THIS BILL PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE OPEN SPACE FOR TO POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE STATE AS WELL AS TWO PILLARS OF THE COASTAL ACT THE STATUTE THAT GUIDES THE COASTAL COMMISSION- THE COASTAL COMMISSION IS MINDFUL OF THE RECREATIONAL ASPECT OF GOLF AND WERE EQUALLY COGNIZANT OF THE LARGE AREA REQUIRED FOR COURSES. THE FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATING AND THESE DAYS OF COURSE THE WATER REQUIRED TO KEEP OF COURSE GREEN IN PROPERLY MANICURED THAT BEING SAID WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE AS THE AUTHOR DID THAT AB NINETEEN AND DOES NOT COMPEL CONVERSION OF MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES AND IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT REDEVELOPMENT INCLUDE. THE BILL. YOU CONSIDER REDEVELOPING A MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSE AND MAKES IT MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR THAT REDEVELOPMENT TO INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PUBLIC OPEN SPACE THE GRANT FUNDS PROVIDED BY THE BILL COULD HELP DEFRAY THE MANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDEVELOPMENT SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSES REZONING AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THIS WILL REDUCE THE COST BARRIER FOR ME PALLIPES WISHING TO EXPLORE REDEVELOPMENT OPTIONS THAT INCORPORATE AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OPEN SPACE INCLUDING POTENTIALLY INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT ARE ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENT. OVERALL IT'S BILLS A MEASURED APPROACH TO ADVANCE SEVERAL STATE PRIORITIES ARE PRESERVING LOCAL CONTROL FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT OF THE BILL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY OTHERS. SEEING NONE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THAT WOULD LIKE TO COME UP. NEED TO CREATE. OPPOSITION SIR WITH THE- YOU CAN SET UP YOUR FREE LIKE. HELLO UNABLE TO CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY I'M ANYMORE MINISTER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR GOLF ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WIDE ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES THE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION GOLFERS IN CALIFORNIA THE ALLIANCE IS STRONGLY OPPOSED AB NINETEEN TEN AS NOTED IN THE DETAILS LETTERS TO THE COMMITTEE ON MARCH THE THIRTIETH WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHY THIS BILLS EVEN BACK IS THAT VIRTUALLY IS IDENTICAL TO ITS PREDECESSOR AB SIX SEVENTY TWO WHICH FAILED TO CLEAR PREPARATIONS COMMITTEE AT THE END OF JANUARY. BUT IF I MAY HAVE A FEW POINTS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ONE AB NINETY TEN CHERRY PICKS GOLF. MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER USES IT PARTICIPATE ARGUES PUBLIC GOLF COURSES WHERE THEY NOT INCLUDED WHY IS GOLF SINGLED OUT. THIS BILL FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS WHICH HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED IN DETAIL ON OUR LETTER TO YOU ON MARCH THIRTIETH. AND LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA COURTS. MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES ARE INDEED CONSIDERED A PARK USE. THIS BILL RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT THE PUBLIC SURPLUS LAND ACT THE PUBLIC PARK PRESERVATION ACT IN MARCH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND EXPRESSED ITS OPPOSITION WE CONCUR. WITH THEIR PREMISE QUOTE THIS BILL WOULD JUST EMPOWER MORE CITIES TO IGNORE THE SURPLUS LAND ACT AND MONETIZE THE PROPERTIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE EVEN IF IT'S NOT WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTS. THE TPL CONCLUSION GOES TO THE HEART THE PROBLEM THIS BILL CREATES FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW SMALL GOLF PROPERTIES WERE RESIDENCES ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEIR PREFERENCES FOR GREEN SPACE PARKS AND RECREATIONAL SPACE. IF APPROVED IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY. DRAMATICALLY REDUCE GREEN SPACE OF COMMITTEES- ALREADY IDENTIFIES PARK PARK LASTLY THIS BILL PROMISES HOUSING GET IT SEEMS MENTAL. ON THE SIDE AND THIS IS UNDER PER. ABOUT GOLFING IN DECLINE NOT TRUE GOLF UNDER UTILIZED NOT TRUE HERE THE FACTS THE CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE OFFICE NOT DECLINED QUITE THE NATIONAL GOLF FOUNDATION TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. MORE PEOPLE PLAY THE GAME OF GOLF IN CALIFORNIA THAT EVER BEFORE. GULPING UNDER UTILIZED NOT TRUE THE NGF ALSO REMINDS US THAT TODAY WE ARE SHORT GOLF COURSES WE WOULD BE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MORE GOLF COURSES JUST TO MEET THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THIS IS A FAIR. AND A CLEAR FAR ANOTHER MISNOMER PUBLIC GOLF COURSES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SUBSIDIZED. AT IT THEY'RE NOT EVIDENCED BY FISCAL REPORTS PROVIDED BY DISABILITIES WILL CITED IN A REPORT SUBMITTED TO. PUBLIC GOLF COURSES IN MANY CASES ACTUALLY HELP SUBSIDIZE OTHER PARK PROGRAMS AND CLOSING ONCE YOU CHOOSE DEVELOPMENT OVER GREEN SPACE AND PARKS AND TAUGHT START TOSSING DEVELOPER REBATES IT OPENS THE DOOR TO PIECE MEALING. IT IS NOT PRUDENT PLANNING. THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD NOT BE **** RUSHED INTO PASSING THIS BELOW PAR LEGISLATION PLEASE DON'T JEOPARDIZE CALIFORNIA'S GOLF COURSE ISN'T GREEN SPACE THEY'RE NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER ONCE GONE ALWAYS GONNA. FOR THE REASONS I SHARED ABOVE AND MORE THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR GOLF AND THE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IT SERVES IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO AB NINETEEN TIME WE URGE YOU TO STOP SPELL AND IF YOU DON'T MIND BEFORE GOING TO FOR THE RELATING TO US DOLLARS AT FORUMS WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THIS BILL. AGUIAR-CURRY THERE. THAT'S IT LACKEY BLOOM HERE BLOOM PRESENT BOERNER HORVATH PROBLEMS RAMOS PRESENT THREE OF US ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT RIVAS PRESIDENT BUSH FELL YOU VOEPEL PRESIDENT YEAH OKAY WE HAVE A FORM IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN AGAIN I'VE I APOLOGIZE. THEY YOU MADAM CHAIR AND OF THE COMMITTEE I'M ALSO SET A MOTHER NOVEL THE FOUNDER OF THE LATINO GOLFERS ASSOCIATION AND A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOLF ASSOCIATION. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL LAW THE FACT THAT AB NINETEEN TEN ONLY AFFECTS MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES THEY SAY IT LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD THING. TERRIBLES AND I THINK COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THESE ARE COMMUNITY PARKLAND GOLF COURSES WERE WORKING CLASS WOMEN AND MEN AND YOUTH RECREATION TODAY AND WORSE IT OPENS THE DOOR TO ELIMINATING ANY ROADING OTHER PARK AND RECREATION SPACES WERE WORKING FOLKS PARTICIPATE IN HEALTHY OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES. LOCALLY OWNED COMMUNITY GOLF COURSE WERE CREATED BY FORWARD THINKING ELECTED OFFICIALS SO THAT WORKING CLASS PERSONS COULD THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ONLY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO COULD AFFORD PRIVATE CLUBS. I WISH I COULD SPEND MORE TIME HERE EXPRESSING WHY THIS BILL HAS HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON GROUPS LIKE OURS WHO WORK AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL TO OPEN THE DOORS FOR WOMEN VETERANS IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR YOUNG AND OLD TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF GOLF. OUR NUMBERS ARE GROWING EXPECT SURELY WE HAVE SHARED WITH YOU WERE THREATENED BECAUSE OUR WORK TAKES PLACE AT MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES OR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS ARE WELCOME. I WAS RAISED IN PUBLIC HOUSING SO I DO GET IT I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING I HAVE LIVED IT BUT THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO GET US THERE. IT PROMISES SCANT HOUSING AT A VERY HIGH COST IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT AND VIOLATES THE SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC PARK PRESERVATION ACT LAWS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS WISELY CREATED TO PROTECT AGAINST THE ELIMINATION OF GREEN SPACE IN CALIFORNIA'S URBAN AREAS. WHAT AB NINETEEN TEN DOES DO IS OPEN A PANDORA'S BOX OF POWERFUL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO SMALL CITIES AND DEVELOPERS JUST SIMPLY DO WHAT THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND HAS SUGGESTED COLLUDED TO VIOLATE THE SURPLUS LAND ACT IN OPPOSITION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHICH- LEAVE. THEM HAVING TO FILE EXPENSIVE LITIGATION TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS LITIGATION. ENERGY OUT OF. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BREAKING GENDER AND CALL BEAR THROUGH GOLF PLEASE DON'T SHUT THE DOOR TO US AND NOTE AT THE EIGHTY FOUR OPPOSITION LETTERS LISTED IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE STAFF REPORT MORE THAN ONE THIRD OR FROM WOMEN'S SENIORS JUNIORS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR GOLF CLUBS. AND ORGANIZATIONS I HUMBLY ASK YOU TO PLEASE VOTE NO ON AB NINETEEN TEN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE WELCOME A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ON YOUR AMENDMENTS. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT'S OPPOSING THIS BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD. JUST YOUR NAME AFFILIATION. JIM PERRIN PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA LINES FOR GOLF WE ARE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THERE ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NONE- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE YES SOMEONE WITH JUST SOME COMMENTS ABOUT TRYING NOT TO RAMBLE- WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF MY CITY FOR SIXTEEN YEARS UNINDICTED I WANT CREDIT FOR THAT. WE ONCE HAD A COUNCIL MEMBER THAT WENT TO AGAINST LITTLE LEAGUE FIELDS. TO BUILD MORE LITTLE LEAGUE FIELDS HE WAS NOT REELECTED. SO I CAUTION EVERYONE WHO WILL HAVE A VOTE HERE THIS IS KIND OF LIKE COUPLE OF KIDS LITTLE LEAGUE FIELDS. N. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN FAILING FOR MANY YEARS BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN MY HUMBLE OPINION WHICH AIMS SO HUMBLE. I BELIEVE THAT MAYBE EIGHT MAYBE SEVEN OUT OF TEN BILLS THAT WE'RE BRINGING FORWARD A KENNEL LIKE FEEL GOOD BILLS YEAH WE'RE DOING SOMETHING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE'S A NEW INNOVATIVE WAY TO DO IT. I BELIEVE THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILLFALLS INTO THE FEEL GOOD FIELD AND IT WILL ACCOMPLISH VERY LITTLE- IT WILL TAKE AWAY THE OPEN SPACE I MEAN THESE FOLKS MADE A LOT. POINTS WAY% BETTER THAN I CAN BUT IN THE BIG PICTURE THIS PARTICULAR BILL ISN'T GOING TO DO DIDDLY. NETS MY FINAL COMMENT MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLUE. MADAM CHAIR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE ANTHOLOGIZED SET FOR WALKING IN ON THE MIDDLE OF THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION- BUT AS I THINK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA HAS ALREADY MENTIONED SHE AND I HAVE- BEEN DISCUSSING THIS BILL AND- AND I WANT TO THANK HER FOR WORKING WITH ME AND LISTENING TO MY CONCERNS- I EXPRESSED CONCERNS. ABOUT SINGLING OUT GOLF COURSES IN FACT I THINKI VOICE THOSE CONCERNS AT THE LAST HEARING ON THIS ISSUE- ESPECIALLY MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES THAT SERVE AS IMPORTANT RECREATIONAL AREAS FOR THE PUBLIC SOMETHING THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND- BUT AT. THE I HOPE ALL OF YOU KNOW- ONE OF MY GREAT PRIORITIES IN A BITING PRIORITIES- SINCE I WAS ELECTED IN TWENTY TWELVE AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS I WAS SENT TO SACRAMENTO WAS TO WORK ON THE HOUSING CRISIS AND- TRY TO FIND WAYS- WHICH- BY NECESSITY. HAVE TO BE CREATIVE WAYS- OF TO SOLVING THE- OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. SO I WANT TO AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- HER MR NARROW THE BILL. OF BASED ON THREE CRITERIA THAT WE'VE AGREED ON A ONE OF FIND OUT- GREED ON OCTOBER SET OF. WE NOW NEED TO AGREE ON THE METRIC. FOR THOSE HERE. I'M AND THAT'S LIKE A BE EASY- COMMITTEE TO A- DOING THAT IN FAITH AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR IS. WELL R. THREE CRY TO WITH UPON OUR ONE LIMIT TO- THE AREAS- LIMIT LIMIT- CONSIDERATION OF A GOLF COURSES TO AREAS THAT EXCEED A CERTAIN POPULATION DENSITY. WE HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT DENSITY WILL BE. WE WOULD ALSO LIMIT THIS TO GOLF COURSES THAT ARE UNDER UTILIZED OR UNDER USED AND AGAIN THAT'S A TERM OF ART WE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE. WHAT THAT MEANS- AND FINALLY- WE WOULD LIMIT IT TO AREAS THAT ARE CONSIDERED- A PARK POOR- AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS AGAIN IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK OUT. I DO HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO- A WORK THESE CRITERIA OUT AND THE METRICS ALONG WITH THEM AND- I- EXPECTED TO. WE WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO DO THAT BEFORE THE SUSPENSE HEARING AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT THAT IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO WORK OUT- THOSE CRITERIA THAT YOU WILL PARK THE BILL- IF AND WHEN WE DO WORK OUT THE CRITERIA THE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE TAKEN IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE THE AMENDMENTS IT AGREED TO AN- THE AUTHOR IS WRITING. A I WANT TO SAY THAT. HOUSING IS A- A CRITICAL NEED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- MY THINKING ON THIS IS THAT IF WE HAVE GOLF COURSES THERE MAY BE NONE. IF WE HAVE GOLF COURSES THAT ARE BEING UNDER UTILIZED- HOWEVER WE END UP THE FINDING THAT- THEN PERHAPS THERE IS A BETTER AND GREATER PURPOSE THAT WE CAN PUT THAT LAND- I. IT'S NOT THAT I WANT GOLF COURSES TO BE UNDER UTILIZED BUT IF THEY ARE THEN I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER THEM- AFTER THIS YEAR'S THE L. A. TIMES RAN AN EDITORIAL AS YOU THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE PROBABLY NO. URGING US TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT A CREATIVE BILL- THIS IS- THE AUTHORS AT ATTEMPT TO FIND A WAY TO. PROVIDE FOR MORE HOUSING AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN HONOR- THAT DIRECTION I THINK WE SHOULD AND- AND NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE GOLFING PUBLIC. THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD DO. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE I'M SURE YES THIS IS MARIE MESSAGES FROM- VERY BRIEFLY I CONCUR- WAS SOMEONE NUMBER BLOOM AND I JUST YOU THIS IS A TOOLS AN OPPORTUNITY- TO. TO REPURPOSE YOU KNOW DRAMATICALLY UNDERUTILIZED GOLF COURSES YOU KNOW I WANTED MY COMMUNITY THAT IS SITTING THERE AND HAS BECOME- NOT ONLY AN EYESORE BUT HAS BECOME A SOURCE OF WEEDS AND- IT HAS NOT BEEN REPURPOSED AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE. A VACANT IT'S JUST IT'S A VACANT GOLF COURSE. TO RE THAT CREATE A PUBLIC USE- THAT WOULD BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE OPTION IT DISTRICTS SUCH AS MINE THAT% LACKS THESE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND- THESE- OPEN SPACES FOR OUR FAMILIES AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE. AT THE ALL THE WORK THOSE INTO THIS I DID THIS AGAIN IS JUST A TOOL- AND- YOU KNOW HOPE THAT- WE CAN COME TO TERMS- AS- BLOOM- MENTIONS. AND I HAVE BEEN MOVED WITHOUT. THANK WE HAVE A OF FROM THE SUMMER MEMBER RIVAS TO SAY VICE IN BLOOM- I WILL DELIVER WOULD YOU LIKE TO. THOMAS YEAH I WILL BE A BRIEF IN MY CLOSING- NOT ALL GOLF COURSES SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR REDEVELOPMENT AT IT THERE'S A SPACE FOR LIKE ALL OF OUR OTHER SPORTS OUT THERE AND I THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT REFINING IT AND LIMITING WHICH IS YOUR READ DAILY TRANSFER BETTER. TO BE BUT IT'S- SURE IN THE TIVITY AND I THAT THAT WHERE WE'RE TO GET TO BEFORE WE GET TO THE SUSPENSE FILE I AND THAT'S MY COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THE THREE ITEMS REALLY NARROW THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL- AND COMMITMENT HONOR MY WORD BEFORE THAT SUSPENSE FILE IS THERE ON THE THREE PIECES THAT WERE OUTLINED I THINK WE COULD HAVE A SPACE WHERE GOLF. COULD LIVE AND IT'S DRIVING IN SOME OF THE OFFICES OF MY COMMUNITY AND ONE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS DRIVING AND SOME OF THE SPACES IN MY COMMUNITY AND THERE'S A SPACE WHERE IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN THOSE LIMITS THIS IS WHAT I'M HOME WE COULD BE CREATED TO PULL UP OF ALL THE- BILL BE.

BUT AGAIN YEAH GOOD THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS AND I AM ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY SIX WHICH WILL ESTABLISH THE HOUSING COST REDUCTION INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO REDUCE OR DEFER LOCAL IMPACT FEES FOR QUALIFIED HOUSING PROJECTS DESPITE MONUMENTAL EFFORTS FROM THE LEGISLATURE HOUSING PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO STAGNATE IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF BUILDING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES CAN REPRESENT UP TO EIGHTEEN PERCENT. OF THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING NEW HOUSING THE COST OR THIS COST IS ADDED DIRECTLY ON TO THE COST OF THE UNIT AND THE SHOULDERS OF THE RENTER OR THE HOME OWNER AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY SIX PROVIDES TO VOLUNTARY OPTIONS. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FIRST AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY SIX WILL PROVIDE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH 50% OF THE VALUE OF FEE REDUCTION GRANTED TO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY SIX ALSO ALLOWS JURISDICTIONS TO DEFERRED FEES UNTIL A HOUSING PROJECT IS CONVERTED TO PERMANENT FINANCING WHILE CHART ACTIVELY PER DEVELOPERS WITH A ZERO INTEREST LOAN AND ENSURING JURISDICTIONS ARE MADE WHOLE THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAM WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COST OF BUILDING HOUSING WHILE SUPPORTING BOTH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. MY WITNESS TODAY IS MEGAN- TOKUNAGA WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND- MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS MEGAN TOKUNAGA I MAY HOUSING FINANCE SPECIALIST WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. IN OUR THIRTY YEAR HISTORY THE PARTNERSHIP HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED NONPROFIT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS OF AND HELPS TO CREATE THEM HELP THEM CREATE OR PRESERVE OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND HOMES FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE ROADMAP THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PRODUCE ONE POINT TWO MILLION NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS LOWER INCOME FAMILIES AN IMPORTANT FACTOR INHIBITING INCREASE PRODUCTION IS THE HIGH IMPACT FEES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CHARGE ALL NEW DEVELOPMENT TO ADDRESS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. A MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT FROM THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOUND THAT DEVELOPMENT FEES FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA COULD BE AS HIGH AS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. THESE IMPACT FEES ARE CLEARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE BUILDERS OF AFFORDABLE HOMES AS THEY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NEED FOR SCARCE PUBLIC FUNDS MONEY THAT COULD OTHERWISE FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOMES. AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY SIX ENCOURAGES CITIES AND COUNTIES TO WAIVE OR REDUCE IMPACT FEES FOR AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING BY CREATING THE HOUSING COSTS REDUCTION INCENTIVE PROGRAM. TO REIMBURSE THEM 50% OF THE VALUE OF FEE WAIVERS OR REDUCTIONS GRANTED. THE LEVERAGED LOCAL FEE WAIVERS WILL RESULT IN COST SAVINGS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION. IN ADDITION THIS PROGRAM WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE STATE COSTS AT STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS NOW AND IT PAYING A 100% OF THE CITY'S MOST OF THE TIME. WITH THE SAVINGS THE STATE CAN INCREASE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SENT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR HELP WITH THE BILL. I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY THIS IS- AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE AND- I THINK MENTIONED EARLIER CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IS EXACERBATING ANOTHER URGENT CRISIS. OF MANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE SEE INTERSECT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT IN THIS CASE WERE. ARE GOING TO TRY AND HELP WITH TEACHER SHORTAGES OF AT THE SAME TIME. RECENT DATA SHOWS THAT ONE IN TEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE LOSING A FOURTH OF THEIR TEACHERS SKYROCKETING HOUSING PRICES AND STAGNANT SALARIES HAVE MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR TEACHERS TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY TEACH. pOFTEN HOVER OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING MAKING THEM- MAKING TEACHERS ON QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING BUT UNABLE TO COMPETE FOR MARKET RATE APARTMENTS IT'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY. FORTY SIX OF THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BUILDING EDUCATIONAL WORKFORCE HOUSING TO ADDRESS TEACHER SHORTAGES AND RETAIN STAFF. UNFORTUNATELY LOCAL RESISTANCE COMPLICATED BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES AND RESTRICTIVE ZONING HAVE ADDED CHALLENGES TO HOUSING CONSTRUCTION ON DISTRICT OWNED PROPERTIES. TODAY ONLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS SANTA CLARA UNIFIED AND LA UNIFIED HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BUILT HOUSING PROJECTS ON PROPERTIES THAT THEY OWN. BOTH DISTRICTS REPORTED STRONG INTEREST IN THESE UNITS BY BOTH TEACHERS AND STAFF BUT ALSO REPORTED CHALLENGES AND DELAYS IN GETTING THE PROJECT OFF THE GROUND. TWENTY NINETY FIVE WILL REMOVE BARRIERS THAT HAVE HINDERED HOUSING PRODUCTION FOR TEACHERS. THE MEASURE WOULD MAKE HOUSING AN ALLOWABLE USE ON PROPERTIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS OWN IF THE PROJECTS MEET CERTAIN OBJECTIVE STANDARDS AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PRIORITIZE TEACHERS AND THEIR STAFF FOR THESE UNITS. AND ENSURES THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RETAIN THE PROPERTY. BY EASING THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE WILL HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONSTRUCTION AFTER HOUSING TO MEET THE CURRENT DEMAND ADDRESS TEACHING SHORTAGES. AND HELP KEEP QUALITY TEACHERS AND STAFF IN THE CLASSROOM IT'S A WIN WIN WIN. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY IS JEFF BENSON WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVES AT THE CENTER FOR CITIES AND SCHOOLS AT UC BERKELEY GO BEARS. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE- AS THE SEVEN MEMBER SAID I'M- DIFFERENCE IN WITH THE CENTER FOR CITIES AND SCHOOLS AT UC BERKELEY AND WE ARE A POLICY RESEARCH CENTER AT BERKELEY MADE UP OF URBAN PLANNING RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATION POLICY RESEARCHERS I MYSELF HAVE A PHD IN URBAN PLANNING AND WE STARTED THE CENTER ABOUT ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO AS A PLACE FOR THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN THOSE INTERSECT WITH PARTICULAR LAND USE AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT ISSUES THAT AFFECT. FAMILIES AND CHILDREN HOW THEY YOU KNOW CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN PLEASE OR STRUCTURE OBSTACLE FOR THEM SO WE DO RESEARCH ON WHAT OUR MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO COLLABORATE ON- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND ANOTHER HAPPEN I HAPPEN TO WEAR IS THAT I SAID ON THE CITY OF BERKELEY'S PLANNING COMMISSION SO I'M WELL AWARE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES PARTICULARLY RELATED TO LAND USE AND HOUSING. THIS SIMILAR ASKED ME TO SPEAK BRIEFLY- IN OUR ON OUR RECENT RESEARCH WHICH IS. THIS BIG REPORT WE DID WITH THE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION AT BERKELEY THAT WAS MENTIONED. RESEARCHERS AT UCLA AT CITY LAB- ARCHITECTURE DESIGN RESEARCHERS AND PROFESSIONALS. AND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION- EDUCATION WORKFORCE HOUSING CALIFORNIA DEVELOPING THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CAMPUS- WHAT WE DID WAS WE EXAMINE THE NEED ACROSS THE STATE WE LOOKED AT HOUSING COSTS IN EACH COUNTY AND WE LOOKED AT SALARIES AND STAFFING ISSUES AND ALL NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WE DID CASE STUDIES ON THE FOR EXISTING PROJECTS THAT THAT ARE ON THE GROUND- WE SCANNED THE STATE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT INTEREST ON THIS ISSUE. WE MAP ALL OF THE LAND THAT PUBLIC CAPABLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OWN IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE AND WE- LOOKED AT SO DEVELOP ABILITY ISSUES ON THOSE LAND AND THEN ON THIS PLANS AND THEN WE LOOK AT POLICY FINANCE AND OTHER CHALLENGES FOR BUILDING WORKFORCE HOUSING AND SCHOOL PLANTS. I FOUND WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID AS YOU ALL PROBABLY ARE WELL AWARE THERE'S A REAL BIG CRISIS OF TEACHER SHORTAGES ACROSS THE STATE- BUT NOT ONLY THAT YOU KNOW THE OTHER STAFF. AT PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE REALLY HOUSING BURDEN- YOU KNOW A THIRD OF PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA WHO RENT. ARE CONSIDERED RENT BURDENED THAT IS THEY'RE PAYING 30% OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT- AND IMPORTANTLY. THESE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND TEACHER SHORTAGE CHALLENGES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING ALREADY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. IN OUR STATE. SO OUR REPORT. HAS VERY DETAILED ANALYSIS ON THIS WE ALSO BUILT AN INTERACTIVE WEBSITE IF YOU WANT TO GO LOOK AT. HOUSING PRICES HOUSING AFFORDABILITY TEACHER SALARIES AND STAFFING ISSUES ON THE COUNTY LEVEL AND DISTRICT LEVEL YOU CAN DO THAT ON OUR WEBSITE- BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALLY NEED THIS AND THEY WANT THIS- AS HE SAID THERE ARE FOUR DEVELOPMENTS. ON THE GROUND- ONE MORE OPEN UP THIS YEAR IN DALY CITY AT JEFFERSON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. THERE AT LEAST TWO MORE SOLID UNDER WAY AND SKATE A STATE WE IDENTIFIED FORTY SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WE'RE EXPLORING VARIOUS STAGES OF FEASIBILITY- WE RECENTLY PUT OUT A CALL FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THIS ISSUE TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET. EIGHT OR TEN OR TWELVE RESPONSES WE GOT FIFTY- WE MAP THE LAND WELL WHAT'S INTERESTING WITH CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS THAT THEY ALREADY OWNED LAND. RIGHT A LOT OF IT'S BEING USED BUT SOME OF IT COULD BE THE REPURPOSE FOR SHIFTED AROUND. OR IT'S ARGUABLY UNDER UTILIZED. THERE ARE ELEVEN THOUSAND PROPERTIES ACROSS STATE ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES. SO THERE'S LOTS OF INTEREST AND LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY ON THIS LAND IN EVERY COUNTY AND IT'S NOT JUST A COASTAL ISSUE. WE FOUND IT IN THE RURAL AREAS AS WELL WHICH WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISING TO MYSELF AS A RESEARCHER I'M MORE SO THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS BUT THE ISSUE IS A AS A FAMILY MEMBER SAID IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED. AND AB TWO TWO NINE FIVE HELPS TO LEAVE SOME OF THIS COMPLEXITY- WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THOSE DETAILS- BUT IT PROVIDES ASSURANCES TO THE DISTRICTS ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN'T BUILD BUT ALSO. ENSURES YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVIEW AND THAT THE PROJECTS IT HERE TO LOCAL OBJECTIVE DESIGN AND DENSITY STANDARDS WHICH REALLY COMES RIGHT OUT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE PUT FORTH SO. I SEE A LOT OF WIN WINS HERE AS YOU SAID- THE HOUSING GOES FIRST TO THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE AND INSECT LEETO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. POSSIBLY BENEFIT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND ALSO THAT THESE HOUSING UNITS THAT MIGHT BE PRODUCED WOULD COUNT TOWARDS A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARENA NUMBERS WHICH EVERYONE'S LOOKING TO THOSE RENUMBER CERTAIN. BERKELEY IS- SO I THINK THE BILL STRIKES A REALLY INTERESTING BALANCE IS REALLY AN ALLIANCE WITH THE FINDINGS OF THE RESEARCH THAT WE DID THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM FOR SUPPORT. ON AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE SO. YOUR NAME YOUR FILIATION. FURTHERMORE WITH LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. ADRIN MOHAMMED WITH LIGHT HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF BILLS THAT AND SPARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR ANYONE ELSE THIRTY ONE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH YOUR BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL- WE DID SIGNAL TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN THIS BILL CAME OUT OF HOUSING BASED ON THE- HOUSING COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. DESCRIPTION OF THE AMENDMENTS. THAT MAYBE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A NEUTRAL UNFORTUNATELY AFTER LOOKING AT THOSE AMENDMENTS AND PREVENT. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION WAS AMENDED- WE- THINK THAT THE HOUSING MINISTER VERY GOOD THINGS AS DESCRIBED HERE- TODAY- BUT WE STILL DON'T SEE A PLACE FOR OUR LOCAL BUILDING AND CONSTRUCT. IS LEADERS TO MAKE ACE. OF FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. LET ME STEP BACK ON THAT FOR A SECOND. THE REASON WE'RE HERE TODAY ON THIS BILL AND OTHER BILLS AND WE ARE HOUSING COMMITTEE THIS MORNING ON THIS WEEK'S BILL. IS THAT WHEN YOU. STREAMLINED THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS AND THE PERMITTING PROCESS STATEWIDE. THAT WELL SOMEONE ARGUE OF SMOOTH THE PROCESS OUT FOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD- AND I THINK WE ALL WANT THERE TO BE MORE BUILDING BUT ARE ALSO TAKES AWAY WAY POINTS FOR OUR LOCAL LEADERS TO WAY AND ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO ARE GONNA BE DOING THE HOUSING CONTEMPLATED BY THE BILLS SO WHEN STATEWIDE LEGISLATION SUCH AS THIS ONE OTHERS WE ASK FOR THE USE OF A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE SOMETIMES WE ASK TO MAKE SURE CLEAR. THE PREVAILING HE PAID. BACK TO THE BILL FOR A SECOND IT PLAINLY STATES THAT A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SHALL BE DEEMED AN ALLOWABLE USE THEY'LL BE NO REZONING- WHICH DOES TRIGGER SEQUEL. WHICH SOME PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM MIGHT BE HAPPY ABOUT BUT AGAIN THAT'S TAKES AWAY A SPACE FOR OUR LOCAL LEADERS TO MAKE THEIR CASE FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. OTHER PROBABLY BE NO DISCRETIONARY PERMIT PROCESS- AND THERE'S NOTHING IN IT WILL BE NOTHING IN THE ZONING AND A LOCAL ZONING ORDINANCE THAT REQUIRES A PARTICULAR PERMIT FOR. SUCH RESIDENTIAL USE ON THE OWNED BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY- AND WE ALSO JUST BELIEVE THERE'S AN INCONSISTENCY IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE- SIX FIVE NINE ONE FOUR POINT SEVEN- TALKS ABOUT. SAYS SOMETHING SHALL BE DEEMED AN ALLOWABLE USE BUT THEN RIGHT BELOW THAT. IT SAYS IF YOU HOUSING DEVELOPMENT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION IT SHALL BE DEEMED CONSISTENT. IS IT DEEP IN ALLOWABLE USE OR DEEMED CONSISTENT THERE'S SOME INCONSISTENCY IN THAT LANGUAGE THAT WE SAW COMING OUT OF HOUSING COMMITTEE. SO AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO STEP BACK AND JUST REITERATE. WITH THIS IS A GOOD IDEA WE HAVE OUR OWN STUDENT HOUSING BILL IN THE SENATE. TO PROVIDE STUDENT HOUSING AT UC AND CSU CAMPUSES WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN ISSUE. WHEN YOU DO THIS TYPE OF STREAMLINING- IT TAKES AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE OUR CASE TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT'S WHAT WE ASK FOR THE LANGUAGE WE ASK FOR THIS BILL- IN OTHER BILLS. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE DOING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. HEY I DON'T SEE ANY- ENTERTAIN A MOTION. WITH BILL A SIMPLE RIVAS SECOND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OFFICE I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FINISHED STUFF FOR WORKING ON WITH THE PHONES COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL FOR THIS COMMITTEE IT WAS A CONCERT EFFORT AND I WILL APPRECIATE APPRECIATE TRULY IS THE EARLY AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COMMITTEE AND I WILL BE VOTING I'VE TODAY. THE MOST TWO PASSES INTO CREATIONS. OF HIS FELLOW AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGUIAR-CURRY IRAQI. LACKEY NO BLOOM. HI BLOOM I BOERNER HORVATH. RAMOS FROM THE SILOS RIVAS ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT RIVAS SIGHED VOEPEL NOT NEARLY VOEPEL NOT VOTING YOU HAVE A FOUR ONE CURRENTLY WE HAVE FOUR ONE AND WE'LL WAIT FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS. I WILL NOT DO ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY NINE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLEW UP THIS AGAIN. THANK YOU CURRENTLY LAW REQUIRES JURISDICTIONS TO IDENTIFY AT LEAST ONE ZONE WITHIN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT WHERE EMERGENCY SHELTERS ARE PERMITTED BY RIGHT. THE LAW HOWEVER DOES NOT REQUIRE THE JURISDICTION TO DEMONSTRATE SITES WITHIN THAT ZONE ARE SUITABLE AND AVAILABLE FOR SHELTER DEVELOPMENT OR HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MEET THE NEED. THE RESULT IS THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PLANNING FOR SHELTERS OR OTHER INTERIM HOUSING AND CREATING BARRIERS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. IN ADDITION CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT IF A JURISDICTION FAILED TO REZONE ENOUGH LAND TO MEET ITS RAINY AT ALL INCOME LEVELS DURING THE PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT PERIOD. IT MUST MAKE UP THE ZONING SHORTFALL IF I IN ITS SUBSEQUENT HOUSING ELEMENT. THE SITES RESULT TO MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL FROM THE PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT ARE KNOWN AS CARRYOVER SITES. THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW AS TO WHETHER THE STATE'S NO NET LOSS OWNING LAW APPLIES TO BOTH CARRY OVER SITES. AND SITES TO MEET THE CURRENT RENO OBLIGATION AS A RESULT SOME LOCALITIES MAY NOT COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATIONS TO REPLACE CARRYOVER SITES THAT ARE DEVELOPED WITHOUT HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS FURTHER CONSTRAINING. BADLY AT SITES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. EIGHT TWENTY THREE THIRTY NINE WOULD STRENGTHEN HOUSING ELEMENT LAW TO ENSURE THAT ZONES IDENTIFIED AS LOCATIONS WHERE SHELTERS AND OTHER INTERIM HEALTHY SOLUTIONS CAN BE BUILT BY RIGHT OR SUITABLE. AVAILABLE AND SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FINALLY THE BILL WOULD CLARIFY THE NOTE THAT NO NET LOSS LAW APPLIES TO BOTH CARRY OVER SITES AND SITES IDENTIFIED TO MEET THE CURRENT REINA. THE BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND WITH A TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY IS ON THE LAWLER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TURN MEMBERS OF ANOTHER AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY WERE LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT I THINK MISTER BLOOM LATER LAID THE ISSUE OUT WELL LAW THE LAW HAS LONG REQUIRED THAT JURISDICTION'S CREATE BY RIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHELTER DEVELOPMENT- BUT WHAT WE HAVE FOUND OVER THE YEARS IS THAT AP A SMALL SEGMENT OF JURISDICTIONS. HAVE PUT THOSE- IT SITES SERVERS OWNED. ZONES THAT HAVE EITHER NO AVAILABLE SITES FOR DEVELOPMENT AT ALL- OR THAT ARE IN HEAVY INDUSTRIAL AREAS OR OTHERPLACES THAT WOULD BE REALLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR AT THE LOCATION OF A SHELTER OR IN FAR FLUNG AREAS THAT ARE NOT SERVED BY TRANSIT ARE. CONNECTED TO SERVICES BUT WHICH IS REALLY NOT MEANINGFUL COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO HERE IS JUST PUT US MORE PARAMETERS AROUND THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY GET REAL SITES THATTHAN A SHELTER COULD LOCATE ON BY RIGHT BE BUILT QUICKLY. TO HELP SERVE THE INTRAMUSCULAR SPRINTING HOMELESSNESS APPRECIATE ALL THE CONVERSATION IN THE WORK WE WERE ABLE TO DO ON THIS BILL WITH THE COMMITTEE- AND WITH RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I DON'T. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON JAN CAN- WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE SINGLE IN THE OPPOSITION. I SEE NO OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- THIS BILL IS PRETTY FAR DOWN IN THE WEIGHTS- BUT LAST WEEK WE LEARNED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT ALMOST TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON THE STREETS OF LA WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- THAT IS UP I THINK BY 56% FROM THE YEAR BEFORE THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH AND HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY AND EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO- HELP RESOLVE HOMELESSNESS WE MUST DO AND THIS IS ONE OF THE STEPS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR DESIRE TO IMPROVE THE STANDARDS OF HOUSING ELEMENT LAW FOR EMERGENCY SHELTERS THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT TO THIS BILL- AND TO AMEND THE BILL TO ALLOW JURISDICTIONS TO CONTINUE TO USE OVERLAYS OWNS IS ZONING INSTRUMENTS BY DEFINING EMERGENCY SHELTERS ALSO RE SUPPORTING A BILL TODAY MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGUIAR-CURRY I LACKEY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE PLAN WILL GO TO ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN. AB. TWENTY EIGHT NINETY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY CLARIFIES THE STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES THAT PROPERTY BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT LEADERSHIP AND ENGINEERS MUST USE WHEN DETERMINING WHAT CONSTITUTES A SPECIAL BENEFIT AND GENERAL BENEFITS FOR PURPOSES OF PROPERTY AND BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT BOARD KEEP IT ASSESSMENTS. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINE SIMPLY CLEARS UP AMBIGUITY IN EXISTING LAW WITH RESPECT TO THE BENEFIT IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN WHICH IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF NEW REQUIREMENTS ON PEOPLE'S INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIAL AND GENERAL BENEFIT. THE INITIATIVE INCLUDED ONLY BRIEF DEFINITIONS OF SPECIAL AND GENERAL AND HAD NO IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR HOW ENGINEERS ARE TO IDENTIFY AND SEPARATE THE TWO BENEFITS. THIS AMBIGUITY HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO DETERMINE WHAT ASSESSMENTS CAN BE CHARGED AND IT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF LAWSUITS AGAINST THE DISTRICTS. A NARROW ADDITION TO THE STREETS AND HIGHWAYS CODE IS NEEDED TO GIVE DIRECTION TO ENGINEERS AS TO HOW TO CALCULATE THE ASSESSMENT BENEFITS AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY CLARIFIES THE PROPERTY AND BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT LAW OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DETAILS TO HELP PARTY'S COMPLY WITH THE BENEFIT SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THE SPECIAL BENEFIT OF THE PROGRAMS WHICH WILL HELP PEOPLE AS SUCH. UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY LEGAL CHALLENGES WITHOUT THE CLARIFICATIONS HE BIDS WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO LITIGATION CHALLENGES THAT WILL SEVERELY IMPEDE. ADVOCATES HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AND AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY PROVIDE SIMPLE CLARIFICATIONS THAT WILL HELP ENSURE PEOPLE'S CAN CONTINUE TO REVITALIZE OUR STATE'S DOWNTOWN AREAS AND ECONOMIC CORRIDORS IN TIME. WHEN THAT THESE DISTRICTS NEED IT THE MOST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I'VE COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON SOME CLARIFYING AND IT'S THAT ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS.

THREE PAVE THE WAY FOR PLAINTIFFS TO COME IN AND FILE CHALLENGES AGAINST THESE DISTRICTS THREATENING THE WORK OF THESE.

MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES FOR I WOULD LIKE WITH COMMITTEES FOR THEIR WORK ON BILL I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS DESCRIBING THE ANALYSIS AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY ONE WOULD REFORM THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION. VTA GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF THREE CIVIL GRAND JURY REPORTS OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GRAND JURY REACHED A SIMILAR CONCLUSION TO THE ONE REACHED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHICH WAS THAT BT IS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS A ROOT CAUSE OF THE AGENCY'S POOR PERFORMANCE. THE GRAND JURY PTA TO PROPOSE LEGISLATION TO RESTRUCTURE THE BOARD ISN'T INSTEAD STATUE. WHAT AB TWENTY ONE EIGHT. IS BY ON TWO YEARS OF STAY. IN BALL DO. I WORK CLOSELY WITH CURRENT AND FORMER VTA BOARD MEMBERS AND CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OUTREACH. INCLUDING HOSTING A PUBLIC VTA GOVERNANCE REFORM TOWN HALL EARLIER THIS YEAR. WE ANALYZED DOZENS OF SIMILAR TRANSIT AGENCY BOARDS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE VTA BOARD SELF ASSESSMENT. THE GRAND JURY FINDINGS THAT WE PRIORITIZE ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION TO THIS EFFORT LAST YEAR. OPERATING ALL THIS FEEDBACK AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY ONE FOCUSES ON FOUR KEY AREAS FOR.

WHERE WE'RE GOING TO FIND A RESTROOM TO USE NOT ONLY INCLUDING PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN SENIORS AND OF COURSE MANY MANY HOMELESS THAT DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY WHEN THEY HAVE. WHETHER IT'S A CHILD OR THEMSELVES NEED TO FIND A RESTROOM. BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC WE UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THAT MANY RESTROOMS WERE CLOSED WHETHER IT WAS- RESTAURANTS RETAIL BUSINESSES WE'VE ALL BEEN TO A PLACE OF BUSINESS IT SAYS ONLY INCOME EARNERS.

AND ACCESSIBLE OF PUBLIC BACK BIG AVAILABLE BATHROOMS IT ONES THAT ARE PHYSICALLY PRESENT ARE OF LIMITED UTILITY IF THEY ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE ONE BARRIER TO PUBLIC BATHROOM ACCESS IS THAT THEIR LOCATIONS ARE POORLY PUP I JUST GOT. PUBLISHED CENTRAL. CAN MAPS PARKS. PUBLIC TRANSIT LINES POLLING PLACES IN LIBRARIES BUT BATHROOMS ARE NOTICEABLY ABSENT. THIS IS PARTIALLY BECAUSE CITY THEMSELVES ALMOST INVARIABLY DO NOT MAINTAIN THE STATE OF. EIGHT TEAMS EIGHTY THREE WOULD RATHER BY THAT. PROMOTE BATH.

OKAY I WILL GO TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS ALSO SOME NEW MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA THAT AB. TWO TWO TWO ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB. TWO TWO TWO ONE. A. D. U. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT BILL. AB TWO TWO TWO ONE WILL CLARIFY EXISTING LAW TO HELP EXPEDITE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A D. YOU. ONE OF THE SPOTS IN. HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW BRIGHT SPOTS HAS BEEN THE BUILDING OF A D. USE BECAUSE SOME OF THE WORK DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE NOW SEE MORE PROTESTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A TWO BUILDING EIGHTY USE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ALONE WE HAVE SEEN A GOOD HANDFUL OF PEOPLE- BILL DATE D. WITH THAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN. PUSH WITH MY SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE TRIED TO WORK THROUGH THAT- WE KNOW THAT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE HAD ISSUES WITH HOUSING AND NOW WE HAVE EVEN MORE. THIS BILL WILL CLARIFY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST RETURN A FULL SET OF COMMENTS TO A PROJECT TO MOAN IT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF A SUBMISSION OF AN EIGHT YEAR. NOW EVERY MONTH IN FORMULA E'S PROJECTS ARE EITHER DELAYED OR PLANNING DEPARTMENTS TAKE SOMETIMES THREE MONTHS NINETY DAYS MORE THE PRICES GO UP TO CONSTRUCT AN EIGHTY YOU- IT ALSO SPECIFIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CANNOT EXCEED THE LIMITS ON PLANNING STANDARDS FOR. OF EIGHTY. OUR THE DEADLY NAY DID IN STATE LAW I WILL JUST SAY ONE OF THE CITIES THAT I WORK CLOSELY WITH THE STATE SAYS THAT YOU CAN BUILD AN A. D. U. N. IT PATCHED GARAGE. WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN BUT IN A DETACHED GARAGE- THE IN THIS PARTICULAR CITY THEY HAVE SAID YOU CANNOT BUILD A NAY D. U. AND A DETACHED GARAGE AND THAT TO THE HOMEOWNER WOULD HAVE TO BUILD ANOTHER GARAGE AND THEN THEY COULD BUILD THE EIGHTY YOU SENSE IN ACTUALLY THEN- ENCOURAGES PEOPLE NOT TO BUILD THE AD YOU SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE- OOPS WE'RE SEEING LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUT IN. AND BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WHERE THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT HAVE THE RIGHT RECIPE MEANING PLANS THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE THAT ARE ALREADY PRE APPROVED- FEES THAT ARE SOMETIMES- HOW ON- IT MEANING THAT THEY HOLD THEM SO THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEN. AS FEES PUT ON EIGHTY USE SO I THINK THIS IS CLEAN UP BILL TO SOME OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING AND- WE THE TWO. SUPPORT OF THE NO WE HAVE- LOUIS MOREAU TABLE KELLER. YOU THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME'S LOUIS MONTANA LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BE ONE OF THE SPONSORS AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE. IF YOU DON'T KNOW CALIFORNIA IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO END CALIFORNIA'S IMMENSE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME SHORTAGE- WERE A PROUD TO PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS UP AND DOWN AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DOING THAT WORK OUT IN THE FIELD TODAY THIS BILL IS THE PRODUCT ONE OF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. SINCE THE PASSAGE EIGHTY WHAT HAS SPURRED THE CREATION OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THESE SPECIALISTS AND HOMEBUILDERS THESE HOMES HELP STABILIZE HOMEOWNERSHIP CREATE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCORDING TO THE UC BERKELEY- TURNER CENTER A RESEARCH INSTITUTE PRODUCE HOMES THAT RENT FOR UP WHAT WOULD BE TYPICALLY AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN- THE MSAS IN WHICH THEY'RE LOCATED THAT'S A WIN WIN SITUATION FOR EVERYONE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE ANALYSIS DOES A GREAT JOB LISTING THAT CHANGES THAT THIS BILL MAKES WANTED TO THINK THAT COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH US TO MAKE SURE THESE ARE ALL RIGHT. THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST RETURN A COMPLETE SET OF COMMENTS ON THE EIGHTY PROPOSAL WITHIN THE TIMELINES DELINEATED UNDER STATE LAW. THAT ALL RELEVANT PERMITS AGENCIES MUST RETURN THOSE COMMENTS. AND MORE CLEARLY ENUMERATE THE ITEMS THAT A LOCAL AGENCY CAN AND CANNOT REQUIRE OF A PROJECT APPROVED UNDER SUB DIVISION II OF EIGHTY LAKH WHICH ESTABLISHES. THAT THAT THAT THE SUBDIVISION THAT ESTABLISHES THE RIGHT OF A HOMEOWNER TO BUILD. HUNDREDS BUT DID YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE TO ACCELERATE THE SUCCESS OF EIGHTY LAKH I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE BEGIN I THINK YOU TURN MEMBERS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK-SILVA FOR HAVING ME TODAY TO PROVIDE EXPERT TESTIMONY ON THIS BILL- MY NAME IS ANY FRYMAN AND I'M IN. A COMPANY CALLED ABODE YOU. BILL SAYS RICK UNITS CALIFORNIA INDEED IN SERVING HOMEOWNERS IN MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS- WE- HANDLE ALL THE PERMITTING FOR HOMEOWNERS. AND ADDITIONALLY DO A LOT OF CITY EDUCATION AS WELL WHICH ACTUALLY GIVES MY TEAM A REALLY UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THESE RECURRING TECHNICAL AMBIGUITIES. THAT EXIST IN CURRENT EIGHTY YOU LAW AND ACTUALLY WASTE A LOT OF EXCESSIVE PUBLIC SECTOR AND PRIVATE SECTOR RESOURCES. TO INTERPRET- THE CHANGES IN THIS BILL AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE. ARE IMPORTANT CLEAN UP AND TIGHTENING TEARS YOU ARE ALREADY DID A LOT. THEY DO NOT SUBSTANTIVELY X. EIGHTY LAW. ROB YOU CAN CLEAR FOR CITIES IMPLEMENTED NORMAL HOMEOWNERS TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE PER THING EIGHT ZERO. THIS SPEEDS UP PERMITTED. IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT CITY RESOURCES THAT NEED TO SPENT ON CITY. I DINNER IS TO ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW. OUR TRIBE AND- THESE ABOARD PERMIT ISSUES. EACH PROVISION OF THIS BILL AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS ALIGNED WITH H. C. D.'S CURRENT ADOPTED GUIDANCE OF CURRENT LAW. IT ADDRESSES THE CONFUSION AND HOW THE LAW IS WRITTEN THAT CITIES IN APPLICANTS HAVE REPEATEDLY STRUGGLED TO INTERPRET ON REAL PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS- IT'S ALSO THE FINAL OUTCOME THAT I'VE SEEN IN CITIES AND APPLICANTS TO MUTUALLY AGREE UPON AT THE END OF THESE CONFLICTS. HIS IS THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF. AFTER DIGGING IN FURTHER WITH THEIR ATTORNEY H. C. D. AND SARAH AND IT'S ALSO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORIGINAL SPIRIT OF EIGHTY LAWS AT THIS EXACT LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED IN RECENT YEARS- I DON'T NEED TO GO OVER EACH. ONE IT'S OF THE BELL. ALLUDES IN HIS BIRTHDAY. BUT I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT MY TEAM HAS PERMITTED OVER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY USE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AND HAS COLLABORATED EXTENSIVELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WITH EACH CD. TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA STATE LINE GUIDELINES. HOPEFULLY WITH CLARITY. AND CALIFORNIA CITIES HAVE THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING TO PROCESS THE IS EIGHTY YEARS ACCORDINGLY- IN CONCLUSION I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. A GREAT REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS BILL- IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS MY TEAM IS HOW TO TROUBLESHOOT THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. REGARDING WHICH DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS CAN APPLY TO SMALL EXEMPTION EIGHTY USE UNDER TODAY'S CURRENT LAW. THE GUIDELINES IN EACH CD AND THE STATUTE PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DETAIL ABOUT WHAT IS X. CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS THEY'RE NOT CONFLICTING BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DETAIL. AND SO THIS CREATES A LOT OF CONFUSION AMONG PLANNERS WERE READING ONE DOCUMENT AMONG ATTORNEYS WERE READING FIRST ANOTHER DOCUMENT AND THEN APPLICANTS ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE GUIDANCE THAT EXIST OUT IN THE WORLD. IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE DOZEN SITUATIONS WHEN WE ESCALATED THE ISSUE TO H. CITY'S TECHNICAL. UNIT TO PROVIDE NEUTRAL PARTY PLEASE GIVE US THE RIGHT INTERPRETATION WE CAN ALL BE ON THE SAME PAGE. THREE SINGLE TIME THEY LANDED AT THE SAME CONCLUSION ON THESE ISSUES AND I THINK AND- THING TO BE. THE. BUT IT DOES LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF SCARCE LOCAL AND STATE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING SPENT GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT EXACTLY EIGHTY AWESOME TENDING SO IN CONCLUSION CHURN MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL TODAY AND FOR SUPPORTING ABUNDANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL INCREASE CERTAINTY ON TIMELINES FOR HOMEOWNERS WHICH WE KNOW IS IMPORTANT IMPROVE THE CLARITY OF EXISTING LAW AS IT APPLIES TO THESE COMMON IN BIG. IT TIONS. SURE THAT CITY TO. RESTRICT WORD AT SITTING GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE ON HOW TO PROCESS THESE PERMITS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH A NICE PRESENTATION THE STRUGGLE IN OTHER. I DON'T SAID THAT THERE WAS.

THIS IS A VERY CREATIVE WAY FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE HAVE THEIR ADULTS A- ADULTS OUT OF THEIR HOMES TO MAYBE WE ARE LOOKING AT POSSIBLY MOVING IN TODAY DO YOU EVENTUALLY AND REALLY DOING THAT AGING IN PLACE AND I THINK. AS PEOPLE START TO SEE THE- THESE OPPORTUNITIES IN THEIR OWN SINGLE FAMILY HOME THAT THEY OWN THERE MAY BE- MORE OPPORTUNE THESE FOR. DO THESE CREE SOLUTION. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU KNOW IF YOU EACH YEAR WE DO BILLS IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT AND WE THINK WE HAVE THE PERFECT BILL BUT THEN WE NEED TO DO THINGS LIKE CLARIFICATION AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR BILL IS TODAY AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THAT FOR TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THIS MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS.

BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY GOOD EARLY EVENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL AND THE DEDICATED WORK OF YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AS AMENDED AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY ESTABLISHES A PILOT PROGRAM FOR ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND THE CITIES WITH THOSE WITHIN THESE. I PROPERTIES INTO OPPORTUNITIES FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY DIRECTING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IDENTIFY THEIR BLIGHTED PROPERTIES AND DEVELOP A PLAN IN CONJUNCTION WITH NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS. LOCAL COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AND LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REVITALIZE THOSE PROPERTIES AND RETURN THEM TO COMMUNITY HANDS. ADDITIONALLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ASKED TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM AND WORK TO REMOVING TO REMOVE THM. THIS PROGRAM SPRINGS FROM A VERY SUCCESSFUL PILOT IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND WHICH I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH WHERE THE SPONSORS TRANSFORM TO BLIGHTED PROPERTIES INTO NEW HOMES FOR THE FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS AND IN THE PROCESS REDUCED CRIME AND THE COSTS TO THE CITY FOR AFFECTED NEIGHBORHOODS. MEMBERS HOMEOWNERSHIP REMAINS A VERY DISTANT DREAM FOR FAR TOO MANY AS THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP CONTINUES TO WIDEN WITH EACH GENERATION. AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF HOMES ARE BOUGHT UP BY INVESTORS WITH NO CONNECTION TO THE COMMUNITY WITH THIS BILL WE ARE RECLAIMING ABANDONED NEGLECTED HOMES AND RENTAL IN REDLINED NEIGHBORHOODS. FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE COMMUNITY TO KEEP OUR STREETS SAFE AND TO START BUILDING AND REBUILDING BLACK AND BROWN WELL FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU AND AS WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ADAM BRIONNA CEO OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS WILL BE READING THE TESTIMONY OF NIKKI BEASLEY. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. NEED HOUSING SO.

I'M HERE TODAY IS A BILL SPONSORED TO EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY AND TO READ A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF MY COSPONSORED FRIEND NIKKI BEASLEY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RICHMOND NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSING SERVICES. RICHMOND NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSING SERVICES ARE ARE CAST IS A HOT APPROVED COUNSELLING AGENCY AN INFILL COMMUNITY DEVELOPER. OUR NHS HAS LEARNED FIRSTHAND THE DIFFICULTY OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE FORCE HOUSING WITH PRIMARILY DUE TO LACK OF SUBSIDY IN FINANCING FOR THIS TYPE OF. FIVE THE REMEDY ISSUE AND OUR MEETING COST COSTA THROUGH. PROGRAM WHERE FIRST BLIGHTED VACANT PROPERTY WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THAT WAS TO PROPERTY SHARE. THE DEVELOPER'S. SECOND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE WITH REGIONAL CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO CREATE NEW FUNDING MODELS TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE OUTCOME OF THESE TWO MEASURES WILL BE FORMALLY APPLY BLIGHTED VACANT HOMES IT RE HAPPENED SOUL TO WORKING CLASS FAMILIES. ALONG WITH INCREASED REVENUES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY IS BASED ON A PROVEN MODEL FIRST DEMONSTRATED IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND AND TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH BENEFITTED WORKING CLASS FAMILIES AND FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS AS WELL SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE BLIGHT AND CODE ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS. I HOPE THIS COMMITTEE WILL VOTE TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT PILOT WHICH WILL INCREASE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WEALTH BUILDING BUT DECREASING BLIGHTED DORMANT PROPERTIES IN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. A MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S JIM BACKER OF THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE RICHMOND COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND RCF CONNECTS. WHICH IS THE REGIONAL FOUNDATION FOR A CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK AS A SPONSOR AND IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY. NOW IN RICHMOND WILL LAUNCH THE PILOT WE HAD OVER TWO HUNDRED BOARDED UP SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE CITY AND THESE WERE COSTING OUR CITY. ABOUT POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR JUST TO KEEP THE BOARDED UP. AND THAT MEANS THEY CONTINUE TO DECLINE. THERE WAS NO FINANCING TO RECLAIM THE SMALL LOT INFILL SITE SO WE IN THE CITY CREATED OUR OWN. WE LOOKED AT A MODEL WHERE THE CITY WAS A CONDUIT ISSUER OF THE INVESTMENT. WE IS THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION WHERE THE BAR WERE AND WE BROUGHT INVESTORS TO THE TABLE WHO. FOR THE RETURN OF THEIR PRINCIPAL AND A SMALL RATE OF RETURN WE'RE HAPPY TO INVEST IN THESE PROJECTS. SO MANY CITIES DEAL WITH WITH PLOY AND BLIGHTED PROPERTIES IN AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY WILL HELP OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT WE SERVE BRING THESE PROPERTIES BACK. AND OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY HAVE FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF CITY CODE ENFORCEMENT TEAMS AS CRITICAL PARTNERS PROVIDING THE INFORMATION ON AND ACCESS TO THE BLIGHTED ABANDONED HOMES SO THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONE DEVELOPED IN RICHMOND. CAN EVALUATE REQUIRE REHAB AND THEN SELL THEM TO GRADUATES OF THE LOCAL HAD CERTIFIED FIRST TIME HOME BUYER GRANTS. AND SAYS SURE THE IMPACT TO THE CITY OF RICHMOND ON THE PILOT. SO OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF THE PILOT. WE WERE THESE CODE FORSMAN COSTS BY OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. WE PAID IN THE RECLAMATION OF THESE PROPERTIES OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AND UNPAID PROPERTY TAXES AND COULD FORCE MILLIONS. WE PROVIDED SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL SPENDING. WE INCREASED ANNUAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE BY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND ACCORDING TO THE NBA THE HOMEOWNERS NATIONAL BUILDING ASSOCIATIONS IS MADE THE HOMEOWNERS THAT WE BROUGHT INTO THE COMMUNITY. PROVIDE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR AND IMPACT IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND WE HAD A FIFTY PERCENT. AND SOMETIMES GREATER REDUCTION IN CRIME IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY WILL ALLOW OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THIS PILOT TO RECLAIM THIS DILAPIDATED HOUSING STOCK AND RECAP SIMILAR BENEFITS. WE HAVE INTEREST FROM K INVESTORS WITH ABOUT TEN MILLION CAPITAL SITTING IN THE WINGS FOR THIS PILOT HAS DESCRIBED IN THE BILL THAT INCLUDES CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND OTHER CITIES IN THE COUNTY. THE CITY OF ALEJO'S WHICH I REALIZE IS NOT PART OF THIS BILL BUT IS INTERESTED CITY OF HAYWARD THE CITY OF OAKLAND AND ALAMEDA COUNTY. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY WILL PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR THIS IMPORTANT THING STRATEGY AND OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP AND ONE OF OUR NATION'S MOST CHALLENGING HOUSING ENVIRONMENTS AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU.
