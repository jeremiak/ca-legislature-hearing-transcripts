SEVENTEEN YOU WERE CALL THE LAST YEAR'S -- DEMONSTRATION AND LEGISLATOR PROVED -- ALL RESIDENTS ARE EXPANSION PROGRAM -- AND THESE ARE FOR OF THESE FOR PROJECTS ARE THE SECOND PHASE AND CONTINUATION DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE PRESIDENTIAL SITES THEY ARE. EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR THE WORKING DRIVES FOR THE FOR TURNOUT RESIDENTIAL CENTER -- THE CCC HAS TWENTY FOUR SITES IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA NINE OF THEM A RESIDENTIAL SINCE OF OUR FOR TO DECIDE IS ONE OF THOSE. PRESIDENTIAL CENTERS. POINT SEVEN FOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKING DRIES. FOR OUR GREENWOOD RESIDENTIAL CENTER LOCATED -- GREENWOOD GEORGETOWN AREA.

FIVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKING DRIVES -- AND ARE YOU KAI ASIDE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY THAT SITE CURRENTLY EXISTS A RESIDENT ASIDE CURRENT EXIST IN YOUR CLASS. AND WE'VE -- RECENTLY PURCHASED PROPERTY IN WILLITS WE WERE STARTING -- THAT'S AGAIN SECOND PHASE OF THAT DEVELOPMENT ABOUT RESIDENTIAL SIDE. SO WHEN WE WHEN WE REPLACE THE EXISTING BUILDINGS -- YOU MAKE AN ASSESSMENT ON ANY VALUE OF OF THE EXISTING BUILDING WHEN IT MOVES FROM. AND I'M THINKING IT MOVES TO BE SOME SORT OF STORAGE FACILITY VERSUS VERSUS A RESIDENTIAL CENTER I MEAN DOES IT THE OR DO YOU JUST. DESTROYED AND BUILD ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL ON THE SITE THAT'S FOR THE ASSESSMENT IT IS -- FOR FOR INSTANCE THE U. CLASS SIZE AT A TO LISA RIFAT FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WITH. MINUTES INYO COUNTY OFICE OF EDUCATION SO WE TRIED TO EXPAND ON THAT SIDE AND EITHER BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP AND OR RENOVATE EXISTING SITES BUT IN THIS CASE -- MEDICINE -- KIND OF COUNTY OF AWESOME OFFICE OF EDUCATION DID NOT WANT -- TO PROVIDES MORE SPACE. AND SO WITH THE SECOND OPTION WAS AND TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER SITE THAT CLOSE CITY AREAS SO WE COULD CONTINUE TO SERVE THAT MENDOCINO COUNTY AREA. AND THAT'S WHERE WE FOUND THIS YOU GUYS SITE AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS THAT. WE'RE INVOLVED IN WITH DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES FROM THE GECKO RESEARCH FOR SIDE WE WAITED DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES OR DIFFERENT OPTIONS WITH WHEN THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES ARE OPTIONS. OF THAT AND FIGURE OUT WHICH WHICH IS THE BEST OPTION TO BUILD FROM THE GROUND UP OR AGAIN RENOVATE. NOW ON THE TWENTY FOUR FACILITIES TO WE OWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OWN THOSE FACILITIES IN LANDER WE'RE RELEASING SOME OF THOSE. FACILITIES AND LONG TERM LEASES LAS VEGAS I IT'S FOR SERVICE MOST ON RESIDENTIAL SITES THE OTHERS IS THAT -- SIXTEEN YES SIXTEEN OTHER NONRESIDENTIAL SITES ARE. EITHER PRIVATELY LEISTER PUBLICLY LEAST -- SO FOR A AS AS A GROUND EXAMPLE ARE SAN DIEGO AND AND AND EMPIRE SITES ARE LEASE FROM. RIDLEY BUT OUR LOS ANGELES -- NON RESIDENTIAL SIDE IS LEASED FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES BECAUSE THE U. K. ASIDE. FROM LAST YEAR THE U. K. SITE AND THE POMONA SIDE OR I GUESS THE THE NAPA. IN POMONA SITE WE'RE ALL BEFORE US YOU. GOT THE WORKING DRAWINGS NOW ON THAT -- YOU KAI SITES YOU GOING FORWARD BUT WE EVEN THE KID AT THAT -- THEY'RE NO LONGER BEING PURSUED AS RESIDENTIAL CENTERS IS THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO RESIDENTIAL CENTERS OR THEY WERE ON LEASE PROPERTY AND THEY DON'T WANT -- TO DANCE WITH THE CCC'S ARM IT SAYS WE'RE NOT PRESUME BUT I REALLY IN MY MIND WE JUST PUT THEM ON HOLD -- MOSTLY -- FOR IN MY MY WAS TRANCE WERE NOT DESPERATE RECENTLY WAS TRANSFERRED OVER TO CAL POLY POMONA -- THE THE NAPA SITE WHERE WE CURRENTLY HAVE A NON RESIDENTIAL SITE AT NAPA STATE HOSPITAL -- THEY HAD NO INTERESTS OF US -- DEVELOPING OR EXPANDING OF THEIR PROPERTY BUT BEYOND FIELD VETS HOMES IT DOES HAVE. AN INTEREST SAYS AND US BUILDING A RESIDENTIAL SITE AT THIS AT VETS BY VETS HOME. THAT'S GOING TO BE A LONG PROCESS AS WELL LIKE TO CAL POLY PROMOTED SIDE SO -- MY MY WE JUST PUT THOSE OFFER NOW BECAUSE OF IN THE CASE OF VETS HOMES IT IT'S A LONG PROCESS FOR THE BILL IN THIS NURSING HOME -- AND A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON THERE SO -- I'D LIKE TO COME BACK TO THOSE BUT NOT AT THIS TIME NOW DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT. I HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CAL FIRE WE'RE GONNA HAVE DIRECTOR PORTER UP HERE -- SOON AND ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT THEY HAVE ARE SOME THERE THEY WANT TO BUILD A TO THEIR FACE OF WORKING DRAWINGS IMPLEMENTER ACQUISITIONS IN HAVE FOR PHONE THEN DAYS THOSE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN COME -- UNWORKABLE OR UNDESIRABLE OR JUST OLD FOR THE CALIFORNIE YIDDISH YOUR SHOP HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM ABOUT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THAT BEING A CCC. YOU KNOW RESIDENTIAL AREA OR ANOTHER FACILITY THAT WOULDN'T NEED THE THE SIZE OF THE APPARATUS BUT YOU COULD. TO WORK FROM THERE DO YOU HAVE THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS WHEN THE CAL FIRE BECAUSE THERE'S A LINK IN THE BUDGET. WITH THE THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS SHOULD BE DOING ABSOLUTELY -- IN PART OF THAT D. G. S. PROCESS FOR LOOKING AT SITES RE OBVIOUSLY WE LOOK AT STATE SURPLUS WE'VE TALKED TO YOU KNOW. AS YOU'RE AWARE MANY THE CONSERVATION CAMPS UNDER CAL FIRE ARE -- DOWNSIZING OR ARE BEING FORCED TO I'M DON'T HAVE THE CREWS THAT THE STAFF SO WE'LL ABSOLUTE LOOKED OUTSIDE CONTRACT ARE ARE GREEN WHICH SIDE ONE OF THE PROJECT SOLICITOR IS A FORMER CAL FIRE PROPERTY THAT WAS THIRTY MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO ARE PLASTER CENTER. WHICH IS CURRENTLY -- ABOUT START CONSTRUCTION AFTER THAT THREE OR FOUR YOU'RE. A DESIGN PHASES. WAS IT IS OR WAS A FORMER ROCK HOW FAR SIDE AS WELL SORRY WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS YOU TRY TO MAXIMIZE. YOUR EFFICIENCY AND AND USES SITES -- AND WHERE WE CAN WE WE MOVE INTO THE SURPLUS PROPERTIES OR OR WORKERS CAL FIRE. TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF SUCH CHANGES OR COMEDY QUESTIONS OF APARTMENT. SENATE MCGUIRE YOUR QUESTION SIR JUST A A QUICK COMMENT ON DIRECTOR AT HAS HAD -- PUZZLE BOARD IN FRONT OF THEM OF TRYING TO BE A TO MAKE IT WORK WITH SOME PARTNERS WHO WANT TO DANCE AND SOME THAT. NOT NECESSARILY -- AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH COAST OF TRYING TO PUT THE PUZZLE PIECES TOGETHER TO KEEP. THE PROJECTS MOVING FOR BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGES. JUST SIMPLY SO APPRECIATE THAT THANK CENTER. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ITEM NUMBER. SEVENTEEN IS CAPITAL OUTLAYS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. SEEN NO PUBLIC INPUT CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS OVER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME [inaudible] KENLEY. CALL SENATOR JONES. I'M LET'S MOVE TO DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN THIS IS THE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN EXEMPTION REVIEW. WAR -- SB NINE A ONE GOOD MORNING -- DIRECTOR BOTTOM. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHUCK BOTTOM I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. I WOULD LIKE TO QUICKLY COVER OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. OF ISSUE SIXTEEN WHICH IS FOUND ON AGENDA PAGE. TWENTY SO THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL IS BOTH SPECIFIC. N. FOR A DEFINED PURPOSE. THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS A REQUEST OF FIFTEEN POSITIONS. AND A TOTAL OF THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND OF WHICH ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND IS GENERAL FUND. AND TWO MILLION IS -- REVENUE FROM THE TIMBER REGULATION AND FOREST RESTORATION FUND WHICH IS MANAGED BY THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. OUR GOAL IN THIS PROPOSAL IS STRAIGHTFORWARD. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO MEET OUR ROLE. IN A NEW MUCH BIGGER TIMBER -- FOR CREATED BY SENATE BILL NINE A ONE I WOULD ALSO JUST INFORM YOU THAT FOR US AT THE DEPARTMENT CATASTROPHIC FIRE HAS AFFECTED US AS WELL. IF YOU THINK IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ALL THE MAJOR FIRES. COLLECTIVELY THEY'VE THREATEN DEPARTMENT ASSETS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE BUILDINGS AND VENTURA WE HAVE BUILDINGS IN SANTA ROSA WE HAVE BUILDINGS IN REDDING. THEY'VE THREATENED OUR WILDLIFE AREAS AN ECOLOGICAL RESERVES. DAVE IMPACTED FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND THEY'VE IMPACTED OUR STAFF -- SOME OF THE MORE DIFFICULT PHONE CALLS I'VE MADE WERE OVER LAST HOLIDAY. TO STAFF. WHO LOST HOMES OR PROPERTY IN THE PARADISE SITUATION? THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IS ALSO FOR A VERY DEFINED PURPOSE. OUR DEPARTMENT WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN OUR WORK LOAD BECAUSE OF SENATE BILL NINE A ONE THAT SENATE BILL REQUIRES OUR DEPARTMENT TO ASSIST CAL FIRE. IN WAYS WE'RE NOT. STAFFED TO ASSIST THEM. WE WILL NEED TO DEAL WITH FAST REVIEW OF THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL NOTICES OF EXEMPTION. INCLUDING TWO TYPES OF NEW NOTICES FOR EXEMPTION AROUND% TEMPORARY ROADS AND STREAM CROSSINGS. TO ADVISE CAL FIRE ON HOW TO MANAGE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. TO REDUCE THIS RISK. WITH ALSO AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT MEASURES THAT MIGHT HELP. REDUCE IMPACTS TO NATURAL RESOURCES. WE ARE ASKED TO HELP CALL FAR IN COMPLIANCE MONITORING AND REPORTING AROUND POST INSPECTIONS. AND TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT. THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION HAS ADOPTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT SENATE BILL NINE A ONE AND IN THOSE REGULATIONS THEY RELY HEAVILY ON OUR DEPARTMENT. TO GO OUT AND DO POST PROJECT MONITORING. AND PRE PROJECT CONSULTATION AROUND THE USE OF THESE EXEMPTIONS. IS THE LAST THING I'LL SAY. YESTERDAY I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. SPEAKING BROADLY ABOUT TIMBER PRACTICES OUR DEPARTMENT IS ENGAGE. BUT IT'S I THINK. IMPORTANT FOR ME TO TRY TO CLEAR UP ANY CONFUSION. UNDER ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO OUR DEPARTMENT IS GAUGED IN TIMBER HARVEST REVIEWS. IT'S TRADITIONAL WORK WE DO IT WELL WE ARE CONSOLIDATING OUR WORK WITH STATE AGENCIES. AND THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THE TREND LINES ON WORK PRODUCT INEFFICIENCIES ARE GOING UP OR DOWN. THE TIMELINESS IS FASTER OR SLOWER. AND I WENT BACK AND READ THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN REPORT SUBMITTED BY OUR AGENCY TO THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IN DECEMBER. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THOSE TREND LINES ON THE ALREADY EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES. THEY'RE NOT ALL COMPREHENSIVELY TRENDING DOWNWARD. EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT PRE HARVEST INSPECTIONS CONDUCTED THAT METRIC FOR OUR DEPARTMENT WAS ACTUALLY MUCH HIGHER. AYE IN SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN THAN THE PRECEDING TWO YEARS. SO ANOTHER METRICS YOU WOULD FIND IN THAT RPORT IS. WE STILL DO OUR OTHER PERMITTING UNDER STREAMBED ALTERATION AGREEMENTS. AND IT'S ALL TAKE PERMITS IF YOU LOOK AT WORKLOAD FOR SIXTEEN HUNDRED AGREEMENTS AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED X. INSPECTIONS. THEY'VE ACTUALLY INCREASED. OVER THE MOST RECENT REPORTING PERIOD NOT DECREASE. OF COURSE IN THIS REPORT YOU CAN FIND SOME OTHER METRICS WHICH SELECT THEY MAY BE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION BUT FOR ME. IT'S NOT A TOPIC ABOUT SENATE BILL NINE A ONE SENATE BILL NINE OH ONE COMES AFTER. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO SENATE BILL NINE A ONE IS ABOUT DEALING WITH CATASTROPHIC FIRE RISK IT CREATES A NEW WORKLOAD. BECAUSE OF THE USE OF IMPORTANT EXEMPTIONS. THE GET CAL FAR WITH SMALL TIMBER OWNERS AND OTHERS OUT REMOVING. THINGS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THAT RISK THAT'S A NEW WORKLOAD. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION AND OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS ABOUT THAT NEW WORKLOAD. ANOTHER DOCTOR OKAY SO WE JUST. PART OF THE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT WE HAVE FOR THE WORK IS THE GREENHOUSE -- DATE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS WE JUST FINISH THE THIRD OPTION AND WE'RE AT MAGICALLY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. WHICH IS WHAT THIS BUDGET HAS IN FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. THERE APPEARS TO BE AN AUGMENTATION COMING FOR FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO DO. MITIGATION WORK IN THE AND THE AND THE I CLIMATE EMISSIONS ARENA. I THINK SOME PEOPLE WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE A ROBUST. TIMBER REGULATION IN REDUCTION -- UP UP PROGRAM WILL BE ONE OF THOSE VARIABLES THAT MAY HELP US REDUCE GREENHOUSE. GASES SO LET ME JUST PUT DOWN A SAYS THAT THE SENATE. SUB BUDGET SUB TO BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE ON DISCRETIONARY FUNDING. SO WE COULD BE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND AND THAT THE LIST IS IS. ABUNDANT THE LEASE IN RESILIENCY. THIS SEEMS TO BE A BIG. BIG -- POTENTIAL SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS IS THAT WHAT IS FISH AND WILDLIFE'S. ATTENTION FOR EXPANSION. ON THIS PROGRAM. I'M BEYOND THE FIFTEEN POSITIONS IN THE THREE POINT FOR THAT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. I MEAN IF WE WERE. TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE TIMBER HARVESTS. IN TREE REMOVAL WITH THE AUGMENTATION. IS THAT DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WITH YOU GUYS WERE ONCE YOU'RE OUT IN THE FOREST. WE DO IN A PRE POSITIONING RESOLUTION THEN YOU'RE GOING OVER HERE AND DOING A POST. OUR WORK IS IT IS THERE SOME COORDINATION THAT GOES ON GET CHAIR YES. THERE IS IN MY EXPERIENCE AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF COORDINATION BETWEEN CAL FIRE [inaudible] OUR DEPARTMENT. REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS AND THE STATE WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD. THAT INTEGRATION AND COLLABORATION MUST CONTINUE TO EXIST TO BE SUCCESSFUL ANDERSON A BILL NINE A ONE I THINK AN IMPORTANT PART OF SENATE BILL NINE A ONE AS AN EXAMPLE. IS A PATHWAY FOR THE SMALLER NON INDUSTRIAL TIMBER OWNER. TO HAVE A MORE DIRECT ACCESS TO OUR DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS TO ADVISE THEM. SO THEY CAN TURN AROUND AND USE THESE NEW EXEMPTIONS. BUT FOR CLARITY'S SAKE OUR DEPARTMENT. WE THINK FIFTEEN POSITIONS IS A REASONABLE REQUEST FOR THIS TIME FRAME. IT IS ONE OF THE SMALLER REQUEST YOU'LL SEE FOR NINE OH ONE IMPLEMENTATION. I THINK SMALLER THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S EXCEPT PERHAPS THE OFFICE OF REPAIR ADVOCATES WITHIN THE PC. AND WE ONLY HAVE TO FUND SOURCE. THE FIRST FUND SOURCES GENERAL FUND. THE SECOND SO FUND SOURCES THE TIMBER REGULATION AND FAR AS RESTORATION FUND WHICH I THINK. THERE'S PROBABLY A POLICY DISCUSSION ABOUT [inaudible] THAT FUND. PAYS FOR OUR ALREADY EXISTING ACTIVITIES. HE EXEMPTION ACTIVITY UNDER NINE OH ONE RELATES TO TIMBER OPERATIONS. AND WE PROPOSE TO USE THAT PHONE FOR THAT REASON I WILL SAY. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO PROHIBITS OUR DEPARTMENT. FROM CHARGING TIMBER. FOR OTHER FEES. AND REQUIRES US TO PAY FOR OUR LOAD OF OPERATIONS FROM THIS TIMBER FUND NO I'M IN A CONUNDRUM. IF I CAN'T GO CHARGE TIMBER FEES TO DO NINE OH ONE WORK. I HAVE A PORTION OF GENERAL FUND. WE'RE SUGGESTING TO MILLION FROM THIS TIMBER FUN. VERY GOOD SENATE MCGUIRE GOV QUESTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. I NAY NIELSEN SEVER THEIR LET'S TALK ABOUT FOURTEEN NINETY TWO THEN AND LIKE TO BE TO TALK ABOUT NINE A ONE I THINK WHERE. FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK WE NEED TO BE A TO GET UPDATED DATA. ON WHERE WE'RE AT WITH ON FOURTEEN NINETY TWO SPECIFIC. TO TWO YEARS AGO I THINK WITH THE LATEST DATA THAT WE HAD. WHERE IT LOOKED AT STAFF INCREASE AND [inaudible] PERMITS [inaudible] TIME DECREASE. SO FOR EXAMPLE I THINK YOU I'M PARAPHRASING HERE. 50% MORE STAFF WITHIN THAT. UMBRELLA. PORTION OF CITY OF W. I THINK IT WAS ABOUT A 15% INCREASE SO. THROUGH THE CHAIR AND WOULD LIKE TO BE A REQUEST DEPARTMENT -- PROVIDE THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE. UPDATED NUMBERS JUST VERY SEE WHERE ADAM NEXT I THINK TO BE TO MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION. THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT YES I AND THEN NINE NINE A ONE I THINK WHERE THE CONCERN. IS [inaudible] IF. THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION IF. FOUR THREE TIMBER FOLKS WE'RE GONNA BE TAXING THEMSELVES THERE WOULD BE -- A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TURN AROUND TIME. FOR TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS. AND IF WE'RE NOT SEEN THAT PLAY OUT. TAKING DOLLARS FROM. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO TO BE ABLE TO COVER OBLIGATIONS FOR NINE A ONE THAT'S A PROBLEM. BUT MEDIA TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS TO BETTER DETERMINE THAT IN THE FOR ONLY TALKING TWO MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] THEN. I AND I DON'T MEAN THAT USED TO MILLION LIGHTLY. ARMED BUT BIG PICTURE. LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE ABLE TO FUND THAT NOT ADDED THAT CHESBRO TIMBER TAX. BUT THAT WOULD JUST BE MY BELIEF AND WOULD LIKE TO BE TO FIGURE THAT OUT WORKING WITH. CHAIR IN IN WITH ACTIVITY HERE ON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL. THIS AGAIN IT IS FAIR TO SAY. THE TIMBER TAX WAS MEANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE PERMITTING. IN A FOR NOT SEEN THAT WITH THE NUMBER STAFF NO INJURIES AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THOSE DOLLARS AWAY IF WE STILL HAVE CHALLENGES INTERNALLY. AS FAR AS EXPERT ON IN THAT SAME WE DO BUT WE NEED TO SEE THE NUMBERS. THEN WE'RE ONLY DIGGING A DEEPER HOLE. THE OTHER PIECE MISTER DIRECTOR -- IN THESE ARE A LOT OF COMMENTS ON THE SURVEY QUESTIONS BUT IF YOU CAN. RESPOND TO THIS IF UNDER NINE OH ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT ENHANCE EXEMPTIONS MORE EXEMPTIONS WE SEEN IN A GENERATION. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME THAT SAY THE WHY DO WE NEED ENHANCE STAFFING. FOR LOOKING AT BROADER EXEMPTIONS. WHAT IS IT THAT THAT SEVEN WILL DO AND YOU CAN JUST ANSWER THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S AN ITEM THAT? WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT ON THE NORTH COAST IF YOU DON'T MIND RESPONDS THAT AGAIN. I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THE SIR. SO I YES ON CURRENT DATA. IN YOUR ALSO CORRECT SENATOR MCGUIRE THE RESOURCES AGENCY. RAPPORT I BELIEVE DATED. MARCH. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IS LOOKING AT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DATA. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS. SOON WE'LL SEE THE NEXT REPORT AND IT'LL BE LOOKING AT WITH A. B. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DATA. THAT WOULD BE USEFUL. I DO BELIEVE WHEN YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE CURRENT PUBLISHED REPORT. THE OVERALL AVERAGE T. H. PER. THREE REVIEW TIME. MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED NAY DAYS IN FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND WENT UP TO HUNDRED FORTY DAYS IN FISCAL YEAR. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SO IT'S A THIRTY DAY DIFFERENCE BUT I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU THE REPORT WILL SHOW METRICS THAT OUR DEPARTMENT ARE SPECIFIC DEPARTMENT. SHRUNK OTHER PERMITTING. TIMELINE STRAIGHT AND WAS MORE EFFICIENT SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE DATA. I WILL TELL YOU ALSO. THAT UNDER SENATE BILL NINE A ONE IN MY IMPRESSION THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE THAT RELATES TO THE DATA YOU ARE LOOKING AT AROUND OUR TRADITIONAL WORK -- I THINK A THING THAT'S HAPPENED IS EXEMPTION NOTIFICATIONS HAD BEEN TRENDING HIGHER OVER THE LAST REPORTED FOUR YEAR PERIOD ANYWAY. EVEN BEFORE YOU GET S. B. NINE A ONE NEW EXEMPTIONS AND PLAY. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN AS I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY NOTIFICATIONS. FOR EXEMPTIONS AND BY THE TIME YOU GET. TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE WERE. THREE THOUSAND TEN NOTICES OF EXEMPTIONS YOU'RE ALMOST GETTING A DOUBLING OF EXEMPTIONS UNDER THE OLDER. AVAILABILITY NOW WE'RE ADDING POTENTIALLY NEW EXEMPTIONS WE NEED TO EXPLOIT TO REDUCE CATCHES FIRE RISK. SO I PROJECT THE NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS JUST KEEPS ACCELERATING. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROMPTLY UTILIZE THOSE EXEMPTIONS TO GET PEOPLE OUT REMOVING TIMBER. AND THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHETHER ONE OF THE METRICS IS A COURAGEOUS. ARE YOU APPROVING MORE ACRES UNDER T. H. PEAS WELL I'LL JUST SAY IS WE'VE SEEN THIS SHIFT. ANY WAY. TOWARDS EXEMPTIONS. THAT NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS I JUST MENTIONED IS INVOLVING MORE ACRES. IT'S ALMOST THREE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES IN THE LAST REPORTED PERIOD THAT WILL COMING IN AROUND EXEMPTIONS. AND I THINK THOSE TRENDS WILL CONTINUE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUGGESTING FIFTEEN PEOPLE. JUST FOR OUR DEPARTMENT WITH THE NINE A ONE TO DEAL WITH THAT EXEMPTION WORKLOAD. BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR IT'S MY LAST IS. TO BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT TAKING [inaudible] DOLLARS. FOR BUT THE TO PORTION OF IT THE TWO MILLION FROM. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO THAT PART CORRECT. AND I UNDERSTAND HOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN REGARDS. TO RELATION TO IT. MY CONCERN WOULD BE IS S. IF I'M. IF WE ARE NOT HITTING ME THE METRICS THAT WE NEED TO HIT UNDER FOURTEEN NINETY TWO UNDER. WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE MAIN MISSION? I ARE WE CERTAIN THAT MAIN MISSION AND SHOULD WE BE LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR THAT TWO MILLION SO THAT. SO I THINK THE DATA AND THEN YOU KNOW WHERE THAT FUNDS GOING TO COME WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BEFORE WE MAKE A DECISION AND THINK INSTRUCTION THE STREET WE ARE HOLDING THIS OPEN SENATOR MONEY YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THANK YU MISTER CHAIR IN THANK YOU DIRECTOR -- I JUST WANNA. JOIN WITH THE COMMENTS OF BOTH THE CHAIR AND SENATOR MCGUIRE -- IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME IN THE NEXT AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO REPORT. IS DO ARE LIKELY TO BE MADE AVAILABLE. I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS DAYS TO WEEKS I DON'T THINK MONTHS SO PENDING. I WOULD PROTECT CERTAINLY WELL WITHIN THIS BUDGET CYCLE. THANK YOU IN IN AGAIN IN JOINING -- CENTERS MCGUIRE AND WHAT CASKEY. I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE COULD. POTENTIALLY MORE CAP AND TRADE SOME. RESOURCES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT ANA INTENT. FOR THE TIMBER FEES VERSUS THE NINE OH ONE WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR L. A. L. YOU HAVE A COMMENT. COMPUTERS AT THE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THAT OVERALL STAFFING REQUEST I FOR DFW IT SEEMED A REASONABLE GIVEN THE POTENTIAL WORKLOAD INCREASED -- BUT CLEARLY UNDERSTANDING THAT I'M LOOKING AT AND AN AUGMENTATION IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY LOOK AT THE BASELINE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PROGRAM AND WE ARE HAPPY TO HELP ON THE IF THAT IS THE MORE RECENT DATA IS PROVIDED WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP WITH TAKING A LOOK AT THAT. AND AND GET YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND FINE TIMBER REGULATION FORCE RESTORATION FUND THAT. SEEMS TO BE A COULD BE A BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THEY COULD FIX THAT. THE TWO ON THE NINE A ONE WORK BEING NINE A ONE WORK VERSUS. TAKING FROM THE FORTY NINE NINETY TWO THE WITH THE WOULD YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT. THIRD DRIVE OVER THE PART OF FINANCE SO WE BELIEVE UNDER THE CURRENT LAW FOR THE USE OF THE FUND IT IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THE MIND SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILL TO CHANGE. THE USED BECAUSE IT DOES FALL IN LINE WITH THE USE OF THE FUND DE. OKAY. THAT'S THAT'S AN OPINION LOOK AT THAT SOME REQUIRE ONE LAST QUESTION. ONE LAST QUESTION FEDERAL IN FINANCE I I THINK THAT -- JUST BECAUSE IT DOES DOESN'T MEAN IT'S WORKING SO IF WE HAVE A A CHALLENGING LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS SO THIS IS VERY COLLABORATIVE. ON IS -- IF WE HAVE CURRENT CHALLENGES IN A MISSION THAT IS NOT BEING. WE'VE CURRENT CHARGES MEETING A MISSION. TAKING TWO MILLION AWAY FROM IT. IS GONNA MAKE IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN GO BACK. BY TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OTHER BEGIN. SMALL AMOUNT BIG PICTURE. AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO BE ABLE. TO THE MORE INNOVATIVE ON THE APPROACH ON THIS. COULD WE DO A LOT OF THAT IN SEPT TWO LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS ITEM NUMBER. SIXTEEN WHILE I PREVENTION RECOVERY LEGISLATION TIMBER HARVEST PLAN EXEMPTION REVIEWS SENATE BILL NINE A ONE PLEASE. GOOD MORNING SENATOR Y. CASKEY MEMBERS -- PAUL MASON PACIFIC FOREST TRUST. AND I WANT TO START ON THIS WHOLE FOURTEEN NINETY TWO CONVERSATION WHICH I WASN'T REALLY EXPECTING TO GO DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE. BUT I FEEL LIKE. THE GOALS OF FOURTEEN NINETY TO HAVE -- GOTTEN CONFUSED IN THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION AND IT WAS A COMPLEX PIECE OF LEGISLATION THE BROUGHT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS TO THE TABLE TO RESOLVE THE WILDFIRE LIABILITY ISSUES. TO SOME STREAMLINING OUR EXTENDED TIMBER HARVEST PLANS TRIED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GOING TO HAVE THE WHOLE PROCESS BE MORE EFFICIENT APPOINTED TIMBERS ARE. CREATED THIS LUMBER ASSESSMENT. THAT'S THE LUMBER ASSESSMENT IN THE FACT THAT IT WAS DEDICATED. TO MAKING SURE WE HAD A ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR TIMBER HARVESTING ACTIVITIES. IS THAT HOW YOU GOT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE TO THE TABLE ON THIS ENTIRE BILL WHICH WAS OTHERWISE REALY VERY FOCUSED ON YOU KNOW BENEFITS FOR OF LANDOWNERS AND PROCESS. THIS IS ALL HAPPENING AT A POINT WE'RE COMING OUT OF THE RECESSION DURING WHICH TIME. THE DEPARTMENT'S GENERALLY AND FISH AND WILDLIFE IN PARTICULAR WERE ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED. I MEAN THE CUTS THAT HAPPENED TO THE TIMBER HARVEST REVIEW TEAMS THERE AND THAT ERA WERE JUST. WIDELY OUT OF PROPORTION WITH THE REST OF WHAT HAPPENED AND THE IN STATE BUDGET. SO THAT WAS WHY WE WERE SUPPORT OF OF AB FORTY NINETY TWO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT STREAMLINING PERMITS THERE WAS LANGUAGE THERE. ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE -- PROCESSING TOMORROW'S PLANS MORE EFFICIENTLY AND TRACKING THAT GETTING THE RECORDS IN THE NUMBERS ARE THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY PART OF IT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHY WE HAVE AN ASSESSMENT THESE AS ONE ON LUMBER CONSUMERS IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. BUT AS ONE OF THEIR CORRECT THAT CONTEXT A LITTLE BIT NOT HAPPY. TO FOLLOW UP WITH A NEW SEPARATELY IF YOU'D LIKE. I MEAN THAT YEAH. HAPPY TO HELP. ALL OF THEM BUT THEY WANNA COME BACK AROUND TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL -- SB NINE A ONE CONVERSATIONS SO FOR STRESS AND OTHER THAN THE NORMAL COMMUNITY WERE VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE. THAT THE REVIEW TEAM AGENCIES WE'RE GOING TO BE AT THE TABLE -- WERE INVOLVED IN SOME. MANNER AS BEST YOU CAN WITH A MINISTERIAL PERMIT AROUND THESE EXEMPTIONS AND SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION IN A PROPOSED THE AUGMENTATION FOR BOTH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND THE F. W.. MORE SPEAKING MORE BROADLY THAN JUST ABOUT THESE EXEMPTIONS AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING ALL THIS FUEL REDUCTION WORK. LET'S NOT LOSE TRACK THAT FUELS REDUCTION IS HABITAT MODIFICATION. AND THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THAT CAN BE GOOD THERE'S MANY MANY PLACES IN THE FORESTS WERE GETTING INTO TAKING A BUNCH OF TREES OUT. AND TRYING TO RESTORE SOME STRUCTURE IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING YOU CAN ALSO BE BAD THAT'S WHY WE HAVE -- AGENCIES TO HELP WITH THE SORT OF A OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THIS MORE BROADLY THAN JUST WE ONE MIXER WERE TRACKING ALL THE EXEMPTIONS. AND AS WE'RE TRYING TO SCALE UP TO HALF A MILLION ACRES A YEAR OF YOUR FUEL REDUCTION FORCE RESTORATION ACTIVITIES ANNUALLY. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE DIFFERENT. RUSTY AGENCIES FULLY ENGAGED IN SORT OF PLANNING THATRIGHT NOW THERE ARE YOU KNOW OUT LOOKING INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AS THEY SHOULD AND WORKING WITH THE OTHER REVIEW TEAMS -- YOU KNOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT BUT I THINK WE REALLY WANT TO BE MORE PROACTIVE ABOUT LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE DOING WHERE WE'RE DOING AND THEY WERE GETTING THE BEST BENEFITS BOTH FOR FIRE REDUCTION AND HABITAT RESTORATION. ACROSS WATERSHED THANK. NEXT AT THIS OF WILL THERE BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT OTHER SB NINE A ONE BCP'S AT SOME OTHER TIME FOR EXAMPLE. ABSOLUTELY [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY. YOUR SINGLE PICKY WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION -- WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO THIS VCP LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT A. B. -- FOURTEEN NINETY TWO PAUL MASONS CORRECT THAT PART OF THE PURPOSE OF FOURTEEN NINETY TWO WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO. A PROFICIENT REVIEW OF TIMBER HARVESTING ACTIVITIES -- IN ADDITION TO THAT THOUGH TWICE IN THE BILL IT STATES ABOUT CREATING THE EFFICIENCES AROUND THAT WORK SO EFFICIENCIES WAS ABSOLUTELY A PART OF AB. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND THAT SORT OF WHERE IT TIES INTO -- THE ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT WAS MENTIONED BY SEVERAL OF YOU UP HERE -- THE LAST REPORT WE SEEN WAS IN TWENTY AS MISTER BONNER. POINTED OUT -- WE HAVE WE'VE NEVER SEEN A TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN A TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT AND THAT WAS DOING JANUARY TENTH OF THIS YEAR -- AND THE TREND IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT WAS THAT P. WHY WENT UP BY -- TWENTY SUBMITTED TEACH PEACE WAS DOWN THE INCARCERATED WAS DOWN AND REVIEW TIME WENT UP BY TWENTY DAYS. SO FOR US THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN REPORT BECAUSE WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS THAT TREND CONTINUING HOW WE REVERSE THAT TREND AND THAT'S PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THOSE AND OF THAT ANNUAL REPORT -- AND IT'S ALSO THE TIED TO SB NINE A ONE THE REQUESTING THE MONEY FROM FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED. TO SEE SOME OF THESE EFFICIENCIES. I THINK WE ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE TWELVE POSITIONS FUNDED UNDER -- FOURTEEN NINETY TWO BECAUSE OF THE BC PIECE STATES THAT. SB NINE A ONE REQUIRES FISH AND WILDLIFE TO REVIEW NOTICES OF EXEMPTIONS I'M ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO REVIEW A NOTICE OF EXEMPTION. IT'S AN EXEMPTION FROM HAVING TO DO A TIMBER HARVESTING PLAN. IT'S A MINISTERIAL DOCUMENT THAT NEITHER REQUIRES THE REVIEW NORTHERN APPROVAL -- IT IS NOT A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN WHICH THEY ARE PARTNERS WITH VISION WHILE I AM SORRY WITH CAL FIRE AT THE TABLE OF THE REVIEW AGENCY -- CAL FIRE IS THE ONE THAT WE SUBMIT THE TO CAL FIRE SOMEONE TO DETERMINE IF THE NOTICE IS COMPLETE AND ACCURATE. AND THEN WE CAN SUBMIT WE CAN START COMMENCING OUR WORK EFFICIENT WILDLIFE IS INTERESTED AND ADDING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO DO MONITORING. OF THE POST WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL THE FORCE PRACTICE RULES ARE -- APPLIED WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT WE THINKTHAT THOSE POSITIONS SHOULD BE FOCUSED WHERE THE MOST. TIMBER HARVEST ACTIVITIES ARE BEING ARE TAKING PLACE FISH AND WILDLIFE DIVIDES THE STATE UP INTO SIX DIFFERENT REGIONS. TWO OF WHICH ARE THE INLAND DESERT AND THE SOUTH COAST REGION FISH AND WILDLIFE IS SEEKING TO POSITIONS IN THOSE AREAS WE LOOKED AT THE ACTIVITIES THAT WERE DONE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THOSE TWO REGIONS. BETWEEN THOSE TWO REGIONS TOGETHER WE HAD A TOTAL OF ONE EXEMPTION. ONE LESSON THREE ACRE CONVERSION AND ZERO TIMBER HARVEST PLANS SO WE FAIL TO SEE THE NEED TO HIRE TWO ADDITIONAL STAFFERS FOR THAT ROBUST WORK THAT'S GOING ON IN THERE -- THE A DOT THE IDEA BEHIND THE TIMBER HARVEST PLANS AND THE IDEA BEHIND THE EXEMPTIONS IS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- COMMERCIALIZING OF THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. THERE ARE NO SAWMILLS PER SE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THOSE ANY OPERATIONS THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE THERE WOULD HAPPEN WHICH IS WHY THERE ARE NO EXEMPTIONS NO EMERGENCY NOTICES. AND NO TIMBER OPERATIONS IN THOSE AREAS SO AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS IS BEING HELD OPEN AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THE NEXT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL NO I'M BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY NOT ON CALIFORNIA. AGAIN THANK OU FOR THE THE CONVERSATION I HAD ACTUALLY WRITTEN NOTES SOME ADDING ON THE FLY HERE -- SUPPORT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME. HE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE B. C. P.

CURRENTLY NOW THERE THERE IN IN -- THERE IN IN THE PHASE OF BEING FINALLY DEVELOPED AND AND IMPLEMENTED -- THE DRAFT WHITE PAPER THAT THE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT. OR THAT -- MORE FOR ITS REPORT OUT -- ALONG WITH INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OTHERS ON THERE'S A GLUT OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES DOES RAISE THIS QUESTION OF OF DATA DO WE HAVE THE INTHE RIGHT DATA TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S OUT THERE AND WHAT AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ALL KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS. OBVIOUSLY THE SPECIFIC THE TIMBERLANDS -- BUT BROWN IN THE CONVERSATION -- REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOU'RE TOUCHING ON THE THE AVAILABILITY POTENTIALLY OF SEE AN OPPORTUNITY SEEM PS IN PARTICULAR IS AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO FINALLY GET THAT DATA -- USING LIGHT ARE USING THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT WE KNOW CAN PROVIDE US VALUABLE DATA THAT IS ACTUALLY CROSS SECTORAL LIKE -- VERY BENEFICIAL DFW AND AND THEIR EMPHASIS ON ON HABITAT AND WILDLIFE -- OF FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROTECTING THOSE PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES BUT ALSO USEFUL TO THE WATER BOARD FOR FOR WATERSHED IMPACTS AND AND WATER ANALYSES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT. THEY CAN CONTINUE TO BENEFIT THEIR AS WELL AS LOOKING AT YOU KNOW A OR B. AND NATURAL RESOURCES OF A LOOK AT OUR LANDSCAPES FROM A FROM A CARD AN ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVE -- IN RELATION TO EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR A SIMILAR CLIMATE GOALS -- AND AND BETTER ACCOUNT FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING AS AS THESE FIRES CONTINUE TO HAPPEN -- THERE WAS ONE REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE I WANT TO POINT OUT I'M GIVEN THE SENATOR -- FROM CINEMA COUNTY IS THAT SOME OF THE COUNTY ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH A A REALLY GOOD PROCESS OF OF DEVELOPING ALL THIS DATA USING LIGHT ARE -- I KNOW THAT ANOTHER ARE GONNA I'M DOING ANALYSIS IN THE SPOT CHECKS THE NEEDED TO GO ALONG WITH WITH THE BROADER -- DATA COLLECTION I'M SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO TAKE TO CONTINUING GAUGE ON ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WERE THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES COULD BE BEST SPENT -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE CITY BEFORE US TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. SEARCH YOUR MEMBERS CRISPY KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF HUMBLED REDWOOD COMMITTEE AND MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANY -- THREE QUICK ITEMS IF I COULD AND SPEAKING. BROADLY TED NINE A ONE IN -- FOURTEEN NINETY TWO I CERTAINLY DON'T HOLD THE DIRECTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT LAPSED REPORT -- PER THE STATUTE IN P. R. C. SECTION FOR SIX TO NINE POINT. NINE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT ANNUAL REPORT THAT WAS DUE JANUARY TENTH SO TWENTY NINETEEN THIRTY TWO MONTHS PAST DUE. OF FALLS ON THE AGENCY NOT ANY OF THE DEPARTMENTS UNDER THAT AGENCY -- BUT NONE THE LESS I URGE YOU TO KEEP THIS OPEN IN THE BROADER FOURTEEN NINETY TWO FUNDING REQUEST UNTIL YOU HAVE THAT DOCUMENTATION BOTH THE REGULATED COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS USE THE ELECTED OFFICIALS BEFORE YOU CAN PROPERLY -- PINE ON ANY OF THESE BUDGET REQUEST MY CLIENTS WERE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THIS LEGISLATION I THINK WE ACTIVELY -- NOT ONLY ADVOCATED FOR IT BUT HELP NEGOTIATE THE LANGUAGE WITH GOVERNOR BROWN THE FORMER PRO TEM AND SPEAKER AND MANY OTHERS. THE ISSUE THAT I WANT TO RAISE IN PARTICULAR WITH THE SUB COMMITTEE IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC STATUTORY PROVISIONS. THAT CALL OUT THE NEED FOR ACHIEVING EFFICIENCIES AND IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME ON TWO QUICK SENTENCES MISTER CHAIR. IN PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION FOR SIX TO NINE POINT TWO SUBDIVISION F.. SAYS TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AND REGULATORY COSTS AND PROGRAMS TO THE CREATION OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE STATE'S FOREST PRACTICE REGULATORY PROGRAM. AND TO SIMPLIFY THE COLLECTION AND USE OF CRITICAL DATA TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER PREVENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND THEN SUBDIVISION DE. CALLS UPON THE IDENTIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFICIENCIES IN THE REGULATION OF TIMBER HARVESTING PLANS BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES. WHEN THE BUDGETS FOR ALL THE? DEPARTMENTS UNDER THE RESOURCES AGENCY THAT ARE REQUIRED TO OVERSEE THE TIMBER HARVESTING PLAN SUBMITTED. THEY WERE DECIMATED IS MISTER MASON INDICATED AND THAT'S WHY THE INDUSTRY ADVOCATED FOR A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE. WE ASK THOSE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS AND THEY PUT FORTH. STAFFING LEVELS THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE AT AN IDEAL BUDGET LEVEL. AND I DON'T HAVE THE IMMEDIATE BREAKDOWN OF THEM I CAN GET IT FOR YOU BUT THE TOTAL EMPLOYMENT. WAS TWO HUNDRED AND TWO P. WEISS BASICALLY A DOUBLING WHICH REPRESENTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY DECIMATED IN HALF. WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THE GROUP OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND THE FUNDING ATTRIBUTABLE TO AB. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO IS IT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO P. WEISS. AND FOR SIX YEARS. THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN WAITING FOR THE EFFICIENCIES TO BE OUTLINED AND UTILIZED BY THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. STILL WAITING AND HAVEN'T SEEN THEM. AND NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED. BUT WE ALSO LIKE THE SUB COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO THAT AND THOSE STATUTORY PROVISIONS AND ACHIEVE THOSE EFFICIENCIES THAT WERE CALLED FOR THANK YOU. WITH THAT WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC. PUBLIC HEARING CENTER JONES. SEVEN QUESTION ON THE SORRY MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR MY TARDINESS AND MISTER DIRECTOR I'M. MISTER OPENING -- AND YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED MY QUESTION SO JUST A QUICK QUESTION IF I MAY PLEASE ON THE BUDGET PROPOSAL -- AND I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GONNA LASTLY HOLD THIS OPEN OKAY GOOD YOUR PROPOSALS ASKING FOR A TWO OR THREE NEW POSITIONS -- FOR THE TIMBER HIRES HARVESTING PLANS -- DOWN IN MY AREA IN THE SOUTH COAST IN THE INLAND DESERT. AND YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE THAT TO TEACH THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND WE NEED -- PROCESSES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I CAN YOU KIND OF ADDRESS. THE LOGGING IN IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ERIC IS IS. I'M NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH A BUNCH A COMMERCIAL LOGGING IN MY DISTRICT. I'LL BE GLAD TO CENTER AND WELCOME. THANK YOU THE SENATE AND BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THE FIRST THING I'D SAY IS. I THINK I PERSONALLY I HOPE. IN OUR DEPARTMENT HAS AN IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION. I AM VERY PLEASED THAT THEY HAVE NEW LEADERSHIP IN THE HONORABLE MISTER GORDON. IN ALL PRIOR BUDGET YEARS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED. OUR DEPARTMENT IN THE ASSOCIATION OF FOUND COMMON GROUND AS WE GO THROUGH. AND I THINK THAT WILL BE POSSIBLE HERE. BUT WHAT I CAN CHALLENGE WITH THIS CATEGORICAL CONCLUSIONS. YOU HEARD TESTIMONY JUST NOW. I WILL REMIND PEOPLE. THAT IF YOU COMPARE THE LATEST FISCAL YEAR. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO THE FISCAL YEAR. ELEVEN TWELVE WHICH IS THE YEAR PRIOR TO FOURTEEN NINETY TWO IMPLEMENTATION. AND IF YOU LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT TIMBER HARVEST PLANS THE AVERAGE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN REVIEW TIME HAS DECREASED [inaudible] DE CREASED. BY SEVEN POINT 3%. SO I ENCOURAGE US TO GET THE MOST RECENT DATA. AND THOUGHT FULLY COLLECTIVELY GO THROUGH IT. BECAUSE ANYONE CAN FIND TRIM LINES OFTEN. AS THEIR PERSPECTIVE IS SHIPPED TO YOUR QUESTION. I THINK IT'S ACCURATE. AND IT SAYS IT ON PAGE FOUR OF OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. WE'RE ASKING FOR FIFTEEN POSITIONS. WHICH IS THE SMALLEST ASK. OF THE TOTALITY OF THE NINE A ONE PROPOSALS EXCEPT FOR THE PC OFFICE OF REPAIR ADVOCATES. ONE POSITION IS FOR THE SOUTH COAST REGION WHICH FOR US IS KIND OF YEAH VENTURA L. IT WILL ALONG THE COAST FROM KIND OF VENTURE DOWN AND ANOTHER IS. ONE FOR THE IN THE DESERT REGION WHICH IS KIND OF RIVERSIDE YOU KNOW UP AGAINST THE MOUNTAINS. AND I'LL QUOTE. THESE WE SEEK THOSE [inaudible] TO PEOPLE. TO ASSIST WITH PROVIDING FREE CONSULTATION FOR LANDOWNERS USING AN EXEMPTION. UNDER THE FARCE PRACTICE ACT. X. BUT IN PERMITS AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THAT MAY BE NECESSARY. TO IMPLEMENT FIRE REDUCTION PROJECTS AND PARTICIPATE IN THE MONITORING OF THOSE EXEMPTIONS. WE'RE TRYING TO OFFER OURSELVES. TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE WHO MAY WANT TO DO THAT WORK. THANK YOU MISTER ED DRUG DIRECTOR NIGHT I DO WANT TO AGREE WITH YOU ON ON TWO POINTS YOU MADE. NUMBER ONE THE NEW LEADERSHIP IT CALIFORNIA'S. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GORDON I GOT ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND AS A RESULT OF SERVING TOGETHER IN THE ASSEMBLY GENERATED A GREAT -- RELATIONSHIP WORKING RELATIONSHIP SO I I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT AND THE AND THE SECOND THING. I DO ALSO AGREE AND THANK YOU -- FOR THE INCREASED -- THE DECREASE REVIEW THOSE YOU ARE DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB AND I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. IT'S A QUESTION THREE JUST A QUICK QUESTION TED JUST DRILL DOWN ON THAT THE VENTURA COUNTY STRETCH WHAT WHAT WHAT WE THINKS. OCCURRING THERE BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY I'M NOT. AS SEEING INCREDULOUS MYSELF AMANDO -- THE NATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE THERE THERE ARE NEEDS IN. WANT TO HAVE SOME CAPACITY IN THE REGION THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING TO BE GOING ON AROUND. EDUCATION MANAGEMENT HABITAT RESTORATION AROUND RESILIENCY SO BUT I JUST CAN USE KIDS A LITTLE MORE COLOR. THAT. I HAVE FOUND READING SENATE BILL NINE OH ONE THAT IT TAKES A WHILE ELISE FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE PATHWAYS IN KIND OF NEW APPROACHES ARE INTENT IS ALWAYS JUST CRYSTAL CLEAR SO THAT'S A DEAL WITH THE CATASTROPHIC RISK FACTOR -- I WOULD AGREE WITH COMMENTARY AND PUBLIC TESTIMONY WHICH I THINK IS TRYING TO SUGGEST THERE'S NOT INDUSTRIAL TIMBER. IN. THAT PART OF THE STATUS RIGHT. RIGHT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LARGER TIMBER COMPANIES. IS NO CENTRAL SIERRA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT I SEE A LOT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE ACTIVITY AROUND SMALL LANDOWNERS -- I THINK THAT WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS CONTROL OVER THE FEDERAL DOMAIN. YOU OBVIOUSLY STRUGGLE WITH PRIVATE LAND ABIDING FEDERAL LAND AND HOW THAT DYNAMIC WILL PLAY OUT OVER TIME. YOU MAY EVEN HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S THINKING THROUGH WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO MANAGE THIS RISK GOING FORWARD. AND FOR US IN OUR DEFENSE ALL I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO OFFER IS FOR EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE. SOME PER. NOT. OVERLY. LARGE COMMITMENT BY OUR DEPARTMENT HAVE STAFF AVAILABLE. TO MANAGE WHAT MAY BE COMING AND ASSIST CAL FAR. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT MAY PLAY OUT THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION HAS ADOPTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. TO IMPLEMENT NINE A ONE HE READ TO THOSE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THEY RELY HEAVILY ON OUR DEPARTMENT. TO DO POST PROJECT MONITORING AND PRE PROJECT CONSULTATION. WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT ASSET. WHERE I DON'T WANT TO BE? IS IN TWO OR THREE YEARS FROM NOW FOUR YEARS FROM NOW. EVEN IF IT'S IN A PLACE WHERE THERE'S LESS INDUSTRIAL TIMBER. OPTIONS HAVE ARISEN. AND WE HAVEN'T HAD CAPACITY AND WERE BLAMED FOR BEING THE BOTTOM. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE PLAYING CATCH UP BY THERE AND I THE LARGE TIMBER ISSUE AND THE WILD LAND AND WHILE THEN URBAN INTERFACE ISSUE IN THE PRIMARILY THAT NORTHERN REGION IS A HUGE PROBLEM. BUT VEGETATION AND FUEL MANAGEMENT AND THE RISKS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE ALSO. ENORMOUS ISSUE AND I I MORE NEW ONES CHALLENGE DIFFERENT TYPE OF LAND OWNERSHIP. TRICKIER MARKETS MAYBE TO PENETRATE AND TOUGHER TO GET A COMMERCIAL OPERATION GOING BUT I I DON'T THINK. WE SHOULD BE FOR CLOSING THE POSSIBILITY OF NEW INDUSTRIES EMERGING AND AND CREATIVE NEW ENTERPRISE IN WRITING EVEN IN CHAPARRAL MANAGEMENT WHICH IS. YOU KNOW IT'S TRICKY TO TO GRIND AND GET TO A PLACE WHERE -- YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE AS VALUABLE OF PRODUCT TO SAY YOU KNOW REDWOOD BUT I STILL THINK. WE CAN'T JUST. HEY. WE GOT A LEAVE THAT ALONE AND JUST JUST STAY NORTH WE'VE GOT A INNOVATE HERE SO ANY OUT I KNOW WE'RE HOLDING OPEN I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT IN THE RECORD TO SAY. YOU KNOW GIVING US BASE IN% SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO GET TO TO HAVE ROOM FOR INDUSTRY TO COME FORWARD AND TRY TO INNOVATE AND WE WANT TO SEE FROM ALL PARTNERS. I THINK IS CRITICAL AND SO.

GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN A WHITE HOUSE SKI AND THE SENATORS -- NO PROBLEM WE'RE HERE AT YOUR DISPOSAL. AND THIS IS THE ISSUE EIGHTY ENHANCE FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND WHAT I'M GONNA SAY -- UP FRONT FOR ALL OF THESE ISSUES. THE STAFF'S OUTLINE AND ANALYSIS THAT'S THAT'S IN THE AGENDA IS IS HIGH QUALITY VERY GOOD AND AND SO I I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT UP FRONT I WON'T SAY IT EVERY TIME BUT BUT FOR EVERY ISSUE THAT IS THE CASE. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT SO. ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT HOW AND AND I AND I AM SORRY BUT I DID BRING -- MIKE RICH WINE ACTING -- THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WITH ME -- FOR ONE OF THE ITEMS BUT HE'S ALSO -- HERE. WITH FOR ANY QUESTIONS AS AS THEY MAY COME UP. SO ISSUE IT AND NUMBER -- EIGHT IT WHICH IS ENHANCED FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES CAL FIRE AND THE CCC. TOGETHER REQUESTING IT NINETY FIVE HAVE GENERAL FUND. AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS -- IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR. OF FOR A COME IT'S A REAL COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF RESOURCES. ALL OF THESE RESOURCES ARE IMPORTANT FOR SITE FIRE SUPPRESSION AND THEY THEY ARE -- HELPFUL TOWARD MEETING OUR OUR GOAL OF OF INCREASING OUR CAPABILITIES -- IN THE NEAR TERM AS WERE -- DOING ANALYSIS TO LOOK AT THE MID AND LONG TERM AND WHAT WILL COME BACK WITH THOSE -- ITEMS AT A LATER DATE SO IN THIS. ITEM. OR ADDITIONAL FIRE ENGINES -- THAT OUR STAFF TEN YEAR ROUND. INCREASED AT A HEAVY FIRE EQUIPMENT OPERATORS. DEDICATED CCC CREWS AND DEDICATED MEANS THEY ARE TRULY FIRE CREWS -- THE WILL BE DEDICATED TO THAT. AIR TANKERS THAT IS -- SEE. ONE THIRTY FIVE AIR TANKERS THAT WILL EXTEND THE LIFE OF OUR EXISTING S. -- TO FLEET OF AIRCRAFT AT THAT ARE -- FIXED WING AIR TANKERS FOR UP TO THIRTY YEARS MAYBE EVEN LONGER. THE EMPLOYEE WELLNESS HI THAT IS BOTH ON THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELLNESS OF OUR EMPLOYEES THE MOST IMPORTANT A PART OF CAL FIRES RESOURCES. A FIRE DETECTION CAMERAS. AND MAKING A A PERMANENT -- ALLOCATION FOR OUR FLEET -- REPLACEMENT. SO. I AS I SAID RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALLY IN GREAT DEPTH AYE AYE I WANT TO TURN BACK TO THE THE THE ANALYSIS IN THE AGENDA AS AS THE AUTHORITY FOR THAT -- BUT I DO WANT -- TO COVER JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE THE COMPREHENSIVENESS AND THE MULTIPLE TOOLS THAT THIS GIVES US. ALL OF THESE TOGETHER -- INCOME WE ARE ARE -- ABILITY TO RESPOND -- TO WILDFIRES AND OTHER EMERGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND BY HAVING ALL OF THEM TOGETHER -- WE BELIEVE THIS IS THIS IS A GOOD -- EFFORT TOWARD. MEETING THE NEAR TERM GOALS WHILE WE'RE WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MORE LONG TERM AND MID TERM -- ASKS THAT WILL COME FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. SO I WANTED TO SWITCH TO CIRCLE BACK THOUGH TO TWO THINGS -- THE ONE BEING WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF OF ALL OF THIS AND THAT IS THE THE FIREFIGHTERS FOUND THE RESPOND -- PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO LOOK FOR LOOK AT THAT AS AS THE OUR TOP PRIORITY. WITHOUT THOSE RESPOND OR IS NONE OF THE REST OF HIS EQUIPMENT. MAKES IT TO THE FIRE AND AND NO DECISIONS ARE MADE. OR THE OTHER OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF AMER THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME -- AND IN THIS PROPOSAL TO ME -- I KNOW IT'S NOT THE THE MOST SEXY PART OF IT BUT IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT -- THAT OUR PEOPLE NEED TO TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR FEET MAYBE BE HELPFUL IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN. TO TO US WHAT'S NOT COVERED ON UNDER THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAM WHEN WE KNOW WE HAVE SEEN EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE AN EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SO YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO SCREEN FOR HEART DISEASE AND CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER. WHY WOULD THAT NOT BE UNDER THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE THAT IT CURRENTLY IS AFFORDED THEM AND? AND AND THOSE TYPE OF NO P. T. S. D. WHY WOULD THAT NOT BE. COVERED UNDER THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM THAT THE EMPLOYEES HAVE HONOR OR A INDIVIDUALIZE EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT. IS. AFFORDED I LEASES I UNDERSTAND MY EMPLOYEES. ED AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND AND AND WITH WHAT I'M GOING TO REFER TO IS SOME OF THAT STUFF CAN BE AND AND EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY USE UTILIZE. ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT WE NEED TO ALSO I DID I I DO ESCOBAR STAFF THAT ARE WORKING IN THE THE MORE -- OFFICE OR SINGLE LOCATION TYPE OF OF SETTING. THEY ARE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE THE STATE -- ANY TIME OF YEAR IT MAY BE -- IN THE WINTER WHEN WE'RE HAVING ORVILLE OVERFLOWING AND AND AND AND EMERGENCY OCCURRING THERE -- COULD BE A HEALTH RELATED EMERGENCY OR OR EARTHQUAKE -- AND THEY'RE GONE FROM FROM THERE -- THEIR HOMES AND THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE SERVICES FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS AT A TIME -- AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO THE TWO HELP THOSE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE DEPLOYED -- THIS IS THIS IS PART OF OF THE COMPREHENSIVE SUITE THAT'S UNDER THIS PART -- THAT ALLOWS FOR ACCESS TO SOME OF THAT PRE SCREENING. CAPABILITIES THAT IS MORE -- DIRECTED TO THEIR NEEDS. AS AS BEING EXPOSED -- TO CARCINOGENIC A CARCINOGENIC SMOKE AND DIFFERENT THINGS AND SO THE SO THERE'S PRE SCREENING THAT'S INVOLVED. THERE'S THE HEART -- SCREENING THAT YOU MENTIONED -- BUT THERE'S ALSO ACCESS -- TO PROFESSIONALS AND PEERS THAT ARE AT THE INCIDENTS AND ALLOW. FOR US TO WORK WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE MAYBE THEY HAVE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON AT HOME AND THEY CANNOT GET RELEASED -- THERE THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO DO TO DO THAT KIND OF COUNSELING AT THE INCIDENT. AND AND WORK THROUGH ISSUES FIRE ENGINE AND OR STRIKE TEAM OF FIRE ENGINES BACK ON THE LINE -- WITHOUT HAVING. A NEGATIVE EFFECT DOWN THE LINE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES. PILOT PROGRAM. WORK OUR THEIR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY'RE UP IN THE FIELD THAT ARE ASSISTING THE OTHER FIREFIGHTERS -- TO TO TREAT THIS THIS INDIVIDUAL OR IS THIS JUST PURE. ASSISTANCE THAT'S GOING ON THAT'S PART OF THE THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S A PILOT THAT YOU WANT EXPAND STATEWIDE -- AND THEN SO THAT'S THE FIRST PART OF QUESTION THE SECOND PART IS OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS I ASSUME THAT THESE STRESSORS ARE GOING ON SIMULTANEOUSLY IS THE ARE THE FAMILY MEMBERS. NOT TO GO TO KAISER AND TO USE THIS. PROGRAM OR IS THIS AN AUGMENTATION OR REPLACEMENT I GUESS IS THE QUESTION. THIS IS THIS IS MEANT FOR THE EMPLOYEE BUT THERE ARE ASPECTS THAT THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT BE ABLE. TO BE DRAWN INTO IF THERE'S IF THERE'S AND THAT IS THAT'S FOR MORE OF THE PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS -- THAT ARE IN THAT IT WOULD BE UNDER CONTRACT WE AREN'T WE AREN'T HIRING -- THE CLINICIANS THOSE WOULD BE THE THE PIER AND AND A SUPPORT FROM A DEPARTMENT LEVEL EMPLOYEE -- THAT IS HIS MORE PEER TO PEER SUPPORT WITH SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SPECIALTY IN IN IDENTIFYING AND WHAT KIND OF SERVICES AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT NEED. AND IT REALLY READ DOES REQUIRE US TO HAVE A A A GOOD NUMBER OF OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AS THAT HAVE THE BACKGROUND OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY RESPONDING SO THEY CAN REALLY RELATE TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE THOSE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS THAT OCCUR. CENTER MONNING QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IN YOUR SERVICE -- RELATED TO THIS THE EMPLOYEE WELLNESS. YOU DIDN'T MENTION IT BUT PERHAPS IT'S SOME. UNDERSTOOD BUT IS PART OF THIS NEED THE INCREASING DEMANDS PUT ON FIREFIGHTERS WITH OUR NEW ABNORMAL IS FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN CALLED IT -- MORE YEAR ROUND. FIRE FIGHTING DUTIES IN MORE TIME AWAY FROM HOME. SENATOR MINING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS -- AT THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AO WE NEEDED YOUR SUPPORT AND NOW WE NEED A DEDICATED GROUP THAT'S INCLUDED INCLUDING YOUR SUPPORT TO TO DEAL WITH THE DEMAND -- IN YOUR DISTRICT WE HAD THE SOPRANOS FIRE AND THERE WERE. THERE WERE PEOPLE ON THAT FIRE PLUS DAYS. AND THEY WERE THERE AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES. AND WE DID HAVE OUR EMPLOYEES SUPPORT SERVICES THE THE THE FLEDGLING GROUP THAT WE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD -- FROM BAD TO WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GO HERE AND AND THEY WERE VERY EFFECTIVE IN HELPING PEOPLE THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. JUST CONCEPTUALIZING THE BASE CAMPS THAT YOU BUILD FIRE SITES. WITH THE SERVICES BE AVAILABLE ON AT THOSE. BASE CAMP SITES THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WOULD DO WE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN -- BRINGING IN A TRAILER -- AND HAVING THOSE SERVICES AVAILABLE AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THE DEMAND. FOR THAT SERVICE IS OUTSTRIPPING OUR ABILITY TO SERVE THAT AND AND INTERESTINGLY IT'S NOT JUST CAL FIRE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE COMING IN IT'S FEDERAL EMPLOYEES IT'S IT'S LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES -- WHO ARE COMING IN AND GETTING THOSE SERVICES THAT LEADS TO MY NEXT QUESTION ARE THE? CCC DEDICATED CREWS ALSO WOULD THEY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE SERVICES. THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS FIRE CREWS. GREAT QUESTION AND WHILE WE'RE BUILDING THIS IS A CAL FIRE -- RESOURCE -- WHEN OUT ON WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO HELP EVERYBODY -- AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT WAYS TO EXPAND THESE TYPES OF SERVICES TO TO ALL RESPOND HERS AND I KNOW THAT -- CPF AND OTHERS ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING TOWARD SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ON MORE OF THE BROAD SPECTRUM -- AND I CAN WORK WITH -- DIRECTOR SITE -- ON ON HOW THAT LOOKS FOR CCC. THANK YOU ON I THINK YOU LIEU TO THIS BUT THE PARALLELS WITH PTSD OF VETERANS RETURNING FROM COMBAT ZONES THERE'S A LOT OF SIMILARITIES. BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THE STIGMATIZING. WHAT IT MEANS TO ACCESS THESE SERVICES? WOULD PART OF YOUR PROGRAM. HAD YOU POPULARIZE THIS IN. ASSURE PEOPLE THAT IT'S NOT GONNA COUNT AGAINST THEM. WITH RESPECT TO PROMOTION INNER FUTURE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. THAT IS A WONDERFUL QUESTION AND AND THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT BECAUSE IT IS AND IT HAS BEEN AND TEN YEARS AGO -- PEOPLE WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT ANY OF THIS IT WAS KIND OF THE SHADOWS WITH HAVE TRAINING WE WE DO HAVE -- YOU KNOW HOW TO RECOGNIZE THINGS BUT THEN IT WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR -- AND PEOPLE WERE GETTING -- BUT IT WOULD BE IN A QUIET. WAY PLACE. THAT IS CHANGING IT'S CHANGING DRAMATICALLY -- I AM SEEING. A AND THERE'S TWO TWO THINGS I WANT TO MENTION. I'M SEEING A PARTICULARLY AFTER THE WHAT'S HAPPENED LAST YEAR WITH THE CAMP THE THE WALLS THE THE THE CAR AND THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT ALL SUMMER LONG AND SOME OF THOSE SAME PEOPLE -- WATCHED THEIR COMMUNITY. BURN TO THE GROUND AROUND THEM. AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO TO TALK WITH SOME SOME OF THOSE FOLKS WHO WHO. FLAT OUT SAID TO ME THAT AS THE DIRECTOR. WE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SS AND WE WOULD NOT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WORK TODAY IF THAT WAS NOT. THERE FOR US AND SO WE PUT A LOT OF OUR EFFORTS THERE -- AFTER THE CAMPFIRE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF OF THE THE IMPACT IT HAD TO OUR POLICE I THINK IT IGHT BE USEFUL I DON'T KNOW HOW THE PILOT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED THAT. IF THERE CAN BE SOME EXPLICIT -- MESSAGING. THE TEAM MEMBERS. THE TECH CAN'T BE A GROUNDS FOR RETALIATION OR LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROMOTION -- IN WE HAVE A LOT OF NEW. LAWS AND RULES HERE IN THE CAPITAL ABOUT -- PROTECTING EMPLOYEES WHO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS NOT BEING SUBJECT TO RETALIATION OR DISCRIMINATION IN FUTURE EMPLOYMENT IN. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. TO MAYBE FURTHER REDUCE THE STIGMA OR THE FEAR -- IN MY FINAL QUESTION OF GOES TO THE CCC CREWS. WHAT IS THE? WHAT'S THE TRANSITION RATE OF CCC CREWS WHO END UP FINDING A CAREER WITH CAL FIRE AND OR ANY. INTENTIONAL EFFORT. NOT JUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE CREWS ON THE WORK THEY DO. BUT TO OFFER THEM. CAREER ADVANCEMENT WITH CAL FIRE. THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION I'M NOT PREPARED TO GIVE YOU A A NUMBER OF STATISTIC ON THAT -- I WILL WORK WITH A DIRECTOR SIDE -- TO TO FIND A TO FIGURE THAT OUT -- ANECDOTALLY I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY -- CCC -- CORPS MEMBERS WHO HAVE BECOME PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WITH US THE FOREST SERVICE AND OTHER. DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AND I KNOW THAT THAT -- WE HAVE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OF SEE SEE SEE THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL IN -- IN GETTING JOB RULES CREWS THAT ARE ALSO A PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE SIX THAT ARE THAT WE'VE HIRED. AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IN THE FUTURE ANY DATA IN ANY. ANY INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE CC CRUZ CCC CREWS ABOUT FUTURE. OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT. WHEN THEY'RE WORKING WITHIN CCC? THERE COULD BE SOME TARGETS THAT -- INSPIRE ACHIEVEMENT IN GOOD EMPLOYMENT RECORDS KNOWING THAT THAT CAN BE REWARDED WITH FUTURE EMPLOYMENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. REPORTER WE DID START THIS BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COMPLETED YOUR REMARKS ON THE ON THE ENTIRE -- I REQUEST AND ISSUE A SO IF YOU WANTED TO BEFORE WE GET TO THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS IF YOU WANT [inaudible] TO OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU I DID I DID HAVE ONE LAST THE IT WAS IT WAS ONE LAST PIECE -- AND THAT IS -- UNDER THE SEA -- ONE THIRTY THE STAFFING COMPONENT AND WHAT I'M CALLING THE START UP COSTS -- FOR THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM -- WE ARE IN WHEN WE'RE OUT WE WE ARE AWARE THAT -- LA -- HAS SOME CONTINUED QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT STARTUP COSTS THAT I I REFERENCED AND WE ARE WORKING WE HAVE ONE OUTSIDE OUTSTANDING ITEM THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING -- TO SUPPLY THAT INFORMATION TO LA -- ON AND WILL THE REPORT BACK ONCE WE HAVE -- FINALIZE THAT AND SO LISTER FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT'S THE LA -- HERE. IF YOU DON'T FACT A ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND SO LOOKING AT THE AND ALL OF THE PROPOSALS TOGETHER AS A PACKAGE AND WE WE DO THINK THAT IT IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE STATE TO CONSIDER INCREASING ITS FIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY RESOURCES. AND GIVEN THAT THE SEVERITY OF RECENT FIRE CONDITIONS IN THE LIKELY HAD THAT THAT CONTINUES WITH -- THE ONGOING EFFECTS OF THE DROUGHT BURKE BEETLE INFESTATION IN AND OTHER CONDITIONS CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL. I AM AND SO WE THINK INCREASING RESOURCES OVERALL IS REASONABLE -- WE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU REQUIRE CAL FIRE TO WORK WITH IT WE ASKED TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THEIR EXISTING FIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY. IS AND WHAT THE GAPS ARE AND TO PRIORITIZE WEIGHTS AND WE'RE RESOURCES COULD BE ADDED. ON AND WAIT AND IMPROVEMENT IN GOALS AND OUTCOMES THAT WOULD ACHIEVE AND WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD HELP YOU TO AND EVALUATE. FUTURE REQUEST THAT -- CAM GONNA COME IN THIS IT'S IT'S LIKELY THAT THIS IS NOT THE FINAL REQUEST FOR INCREASING AND FIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY YOU'VE PROVIDED A LOT OF MONEY IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN THIS BUDGET ON AND COMING YEARS AND SO WE THINK THIS ASSESSMENT WOULD REALLY HELP INFORM. ON THE FUTURE DECISIONS THAT YOU ARE LIKELY GOING TO NEED TO MAKE TO ENSURE THAT INCREASE RESOURCES ARE PAID AND THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AREAS AND THE INCREASES ARE DONE IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY. THAT'S THE SORT OF OVERALL AND WITH REGARD TO THE THE C. -- ONE THIRTY TANKERS THAT THE PROPOSAL OVERALL WAS WAS SOMEWHAT LACKING IN DETAIL AND THAT WE WE TYPICALLY EXPECT TO SEE WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS REALLY ESSENTIALLY INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS PACKED. PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THIS HE WENT -- THIRTY TANKERS ON THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND RESPONSIVE TO ASK IN THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ACROSS THE VARIOUS I AM A DIFFERENT. COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO A YOU KNOW SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH STAFF WE WOULD KNOW THAT THOSE THAT BACK AND FORTH ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S PUBLIC AND SO. FOR THE PUBLIC TRYING TO FOLLOW LONGER FOLKS TRYING TO TO LOOK BACK -- AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS YEAR ONCE ONCE THIS IS DONE. AND IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO HAVE SOME OF THAT DETAIL IN INFORMATION AND THAT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK TO GET THE QUESTIONS ANSWERED ON THE C. -- ONE THIRTY TANKERS -- WHAT WERE TALKING ADAM INCREASING TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUT YOUR COSTS WHILE THESE PLANES WOULD BE PROVIDED -- FOR FREE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ON MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONAL COSTS -- WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THOSE COSTS ALL IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECEIVED AND THAT THERE COULD BE A POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS BEYOND THAT AND SO WILL CONTINUE WORKING HOPEFULLY THE NEXT TIME THIS COMES UP ON THIS WILL HAVE MORE TO REPORT BACK -- BUT WANT TO ENSURE THAT YOU ALL HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS INCLUDED IN THAT PROPOSAL. FINANCE HOUSING HERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND JUST WANT TO REITERATE OUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ELIO STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED AND THE PUBLIC HAS THE INFORMATION AND HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION AND SO WE ARE. COMMITTED TO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT FUTURE PROPOSALS HAVE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF DETAIL I'M WE DIDN'T KNOW I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT AND THEN PASS IT BACK AND TO THE DIRECTOR WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THIS BETTER BUT NOTED FROM THE AGENDA -- THAT THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO REQUIRE CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE AN ASSESSMENT BY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY AND OUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT IS V&lt;c.cyan&gt; IS THIS&lt;/c&gt; ASSESSMENT IS VITAL. IN TERMS OF MAKING DECISIONS -- RELATED TO CAL FIRE IS OPERATIONAL NEEDS THAT IS A FAIRLY SHORT TIME LINE SPECIFICALLY AS WE KNOW FIRE THEIR FIRE ACTIVITY IS GOING TO BE RAMPING UP AND WILL CARRY THROUGH DECEMBER INTO THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM. LIKE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE TYPE OF A DEEPER DIVE DATA ANALYSIS AND THAT REALLY WOULD INFORM I'M SORT OF THE STATE'S LONGER TERM PROJECTIONS IN TERMS OF CAL FIRES NEEDS. REALLY DOES THE CHAIR PASSED ON AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE S. R. A SO IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A IS A A NICE. TIME -- TO SINCE WERE ASKING FOR FORTY MILLION IN AND FIRE TRUCKS AND WE'RE ASKING FOR FIFTEEN MILLION AN INCREASE STAFFING THAT IN THE EIGHTY FOUR MILLION THAT WE'RE BACK FILLING. ON THE THE LEGISLATION THAT WE PASSED ON EXTENDING THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WOULD SEEM LIKE MONEY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IF WE JUST DID BUSINESS AS USUAL AND WENT BACK TO THE THE WAITED WE HAD TRADITIONALLY. ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED WOULD PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR THE THE AT LEAST THIS ITEM OF NINE POINT. NINETY SIX POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. IT IS JUST TO CLARIFY IT IN TERMS OF THIS YOU RESPONSIBILITY AREA FIRE PREVENTION FIND IN TERMS OF THE FEES THAT WERE DEPOSITED INTO THAT FIND. THAT AMOUNT IS IS BEEN FULLY BAK FILLED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO CAL FIRE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE SEAT RESPONSIBILITY AREA FIRE PREVENTION FUND WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED. I'M CONSISTENT WITH WITH PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE AND EIGHTY THREE NINETY EIGHT WHICH EXTENDED THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM RIGHT IN IF THAT PROVISION OF BACK FILLING THE S. R. A FEE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT LEGISLATION THAT WE IMPROVE. THEM WE WOULD HAVE AN ADDITIONAL WE WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CAP AND TRADE FUND WHICH IS. WHICH WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR MANY THE RESOURCES THAT WERE WERE LOOKING AT AND IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL I JUST YOU KNOW REYES RESET WITH FINANCE WHICH HAVE REYES BEFORE BECAUSE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AS WE GO THROUGH OTHER. THIS BUDGET SEASON TO TO AUGMENT OUR RESOURCES WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT THE CATASTROPHIC. CONSEQUENCES SO WE WE WE DID SOMETHING WAS SUPERB. A DEAL AND I AND I GET THAT BUT WE NEVER I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE DID THAT EXTENSION AND THE AND THE FIRE SEASON SO I JUST. RAISE IT WON'T BE THE LAST TIME I REYES SAID -- WE HAVE OF CENTER STERN HAS QUESTION [inaudible] RIGHT. SO I JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT SAY THINK IT AT CHIEF FOR ADVANCEMENTS ENGINE PART IN A FINANCE -- WHO HAVE BEEN SO GOOD ON ALL ISSUES THE FIRES OF THE PAST WITH YEAH AND -- BOTH ON RECOVERY IN RESPONSE TO JUST ONE TAKE MOMENT -- IN OFTEN DISPOSITIVE IN MAYES AND WORK WITH AND JUST WANT TO COME TO THE THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES AND OF COURSE THE CAL FIRE FOR EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN DOING. ON THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN FACING -- IN IS AN INCREDIBLY RESPONSIVE. LIKE TO BE A CENTER STERN I BEEN WORKING. ON THE ISSUE OF ADDITIONAL. FIRE ENGINES WITH CAL FIRE -- IN ONE OF THE FIRST OF ALL SAY THANK YOU I TO THE GOVERNOR FOR ADVANCING THE THIRTEEN ON AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. I WANNA BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE LARGER BUDGET HEARING. ON IN GOING TO THAT JUST A BIT SO. UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE SOME NUANCES WITH CONTRACT COUNTIES OF WHERE. ORIGINALLY ENGINES WERE LEFT FOR EXAMPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY -- WHEN NAY TRANSITION? AND REMAIN IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT THERE'S SOME NUANCES IN REGARDS TO WHERE WE'VE BEEN WITH. NUMBER OF ENGINES PERSONNEL ON THE ROAD AND WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. IF WE LOOK BACK HISTORICALLY TO SAY I'M. WE HAVE. TWENTY THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE P. FIRE ENGINES RIGHT NOW. I SEASONAL AS WELL AS FULL TIME. ON THE ROAD. EACH FIRE SEASON. IF WE LOOK AT PLUS THIRTEEN AS OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT TAKES IS THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX ANDERSON THOSE. THIRTEEN OR ALL PROPOSED TO BE FULL TIME. AND THAT STILL KEEPS US BELOW WHERE WE'RE AT IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IF WE FAST FORWARD AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE TYPE OF FIRES THAT THIS IS BEEN SEEN OF THE LAST DECADE. I WILL GO THROUGH ALL THE STATISTICS BUT IT'S NOT ONLY. THE LARGEST BUT THE MOST STRUCTURE. WE DISCUSSED LE LET ME HEARING A THAT I CENTER STERN HOSTED. WITH US YESTERDAY -- INTO WAS A THINKING FIRE MARSHALL FOR BEING SO ELOQUENT. IN HIS PRESENTATION. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME -- BAN WITH ISSUES OF BEING ABLE TO GET FOLKS TRAINED. TO BE A STAFF THE ENGINES ANYWHERE TO GET THE ENGINES FULLY OUTFITTING DEVELOP. GOING THROUGH THE VENDOR YES IT. THIRTEEN AND THE SAME TIME THOUGH. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THE STATE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO GO THE NUMBER OF ACRES THAT ARE BURNING? LOSING JUST IN PARADISE ALONE LAST YEAR NINETEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES LARGEST WHILE LINE FIRING HER I NATION'S HISTORY THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE -- IN THIS TREND CONTINUES TO GET WORSE WE ARE STILL AT NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE A IS. UP BEYOND. AND IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT AN EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME ADVANCEMENT. OF FROM THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO GET US THOSE -- ENGINES PURCHASED IT WOULD BE ABOUT A SIXTY TO SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING COST. THERE'S SOME FLUCTUATE FLUCTUATING THERE BECAUSE DEPENDING ON IF IT'S THREE OR THREE POINT TWO FIVE RANGING THAT'S ALL NEED TO GET WORKED OUT. I'M. BUT THAT'S WHERE I THINK. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO IN -- STERN I KNOW WILL SPEAK TO THIS AS WELL BUT CHIEF. I I THINK OUR I'VE HEARD FOLKS IN CAL FIRE SAY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET. TO FOUR HUNDRED CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT -- AND HOW WE CAN ADVANCE. I ADDITIONAL ENGINES THIS YEAR. ON THE THIRTEENTH BE ON THE THIRTEENTH. GREAT GREAT THE QUESTION AMEND TAKE THAT -- IN IN TWO WAYS UHHUH START TO START WITH WHY WERE AT THIRTEEN AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIRTEEN IS THE IS THE MAGIC NUMBER. WE WE DON'T -- WE KNOW THAT WITH THIRTEEN WITH THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT A HEAVY FIRE EQUIPMENT OPERATORS -- THE AIR TANKER -- START UP COSTS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OUR ADDITIONAL HELICOPTERS ARE COMING OUT WHICH ARE NOT PART OF THIS THERE ALREADY THOSE ARE COMING FROM LAST YEAR THOSE IN A INCREASED CAPABILITIES BUT THESE. THE CCC CREWS ARE BACK FILLING SOME OF OUR OUR CREWS THAT ARE STARTING TO DUE TO LACK OF INMATES -- AND THEN -- THE THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN HERE -- THOSE ARE AS A SWEET -- THEY'RE GETTING US TO WEAR OR WE CAN REALLY MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR WITH A WITH A BETTER RESOURCE TO DO SO -- AS FAR AS IF WE COULD DO MORE A MINUTE TAKE YOUR YOUR SECOND WILL. COULD WE GET TO MORE THIS THIS -- THIS YEAR -- IF WE COULD DO MORE I WOULD SAY -- THERE IS PROBABLY. MORE THAT WE COULD DO -- IT WOULD BE A TALL ORDER TO DO MORE THAN THE THIRTEEN I BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RATE RAISED RELATED -- TO PURCHASING THE EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS AS A TRAINING THE LOUISE. TO OPERATE THAT EQUIPMENT. AND PERMANENT AND HAVE THEM AS PERMANENT EMPLOYEES -- BUT THE THE SUITE THAT WE HAVE -- IN FRONT OF US AND AND WE'RE PRESENTING -- THROUGH THIS BUDGET IS IS -- KIND OF WHERE WE FEEL IS IS IS A NO REGRETS ASK AND THIS IS WHERE WE WE ARE CURRENTLY -- RELATED -- TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVENTY FIVE I I II -- I UNDERSTAND THAT AND THE AND I CAN'T DISAGREE THAT IN IN OUR MATH WE HAVE -- TWENTY THREE LESS ENGINES THAN WE DID AT THAT POINT TIME -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE LESS -- EMPLOYEES ON ENGINES BUT THAT WAS A VERY SEASONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT -- WE HAVE MOVED TO A VERY YEAR ROUND FIRE DEPARTMENT NEED AND SO SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT THE BALANCE IS BETWEEN PERMANENT YEAR ROUND FIRE ENGINES AND STAFFING. AS OPPOSED TO OUR SEASONAL PEAK NEEDS THESE THIRTEEN WILL ADD TO OUR PEAK NEEDS -- WHERE BACK IN IN THE IN THE SEVENTIES WE WERE WHOLLY A -- A SEASONAL FIRED ANYBODY ON WINTERS LIKE THIS -- MY I THINK HERE'S YOU ARE THE THE EXPERT I'M A LAY PERSON IN -- TEEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. IN OUR OUR NEXT THE WOODS. THERE IS NO GREATER CHAMPION FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOR FIREFIGHTERS IN YOU CHIEF. BUT THERE IS NO BETTER TOOL TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE WHAT I WILL CALL CRISIS WITHIN THE RANKS OF CAO FIGHTER AND OR MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN GETTING ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL ON BOARD. OUT WE ARE. TAX SEEN OUR FIREFIGHTERS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. YOU HAVE MORE STRESS LEAVING YOU'VE HAD EVER BEFORE. I'M THERE ARE MORE CHALLENGES WITHIN THE RANKS OF PHYSICAL INJURY INJURY OR HEAR FROM. THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND BOTTOM LINE IS WE CAN. ADVANCE WHICH WE SHOULD IN IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. MENTAL HEALTH FOR FIREFIGHTERS WE NEED MORE FIREFIGHTERS. I'M GONNA GO BACK TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE STARTED THE ANALYSIS ALREADY WITH THE YES. THREE HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED PARTS OF THREE AN ENGINE FOR REQUESTED IN THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS NORTH A FIRESTORM HUNDRED THIRTY RIGHT TURN. THIRTY OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS NOT KEEPING UP WITH A SEVERITY FIRES THAT WE HAVE CAL FIRES UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE SEVERITY FIRES THAT WE HAVE. IN THE BEST TOOL THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT THE CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO MIDDLE HEALTH. WITH FIREFIGHTERS BEING GONE TWO THREE FOUR MONTHS AT A TIME IT'S GETTING MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. AND WE CAN'T COMPARE THE CONDITIONS HE'S THE CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE HERE. I KNOW I'M PREACHING THE CHOIR ALL I'M SAYING IS. IT IS TIME TO BE ABLE TO BITE THE BULLET AND MAKE THE INVESTMENT -- AND LONG TERM IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE INSURED LOSSES THAT WE'VE HAD OVER TWELVE BILLION. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE A I GREW TO CHAIR WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT FIRE. PREVENTION. AND WE HAVE TO BE A LOOK AT FIRE RESPONSE AND I THINK THAT WERE NOT THERE WITH IN THIS BUDGET WHICH IS WHY. WANT TO BE A CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE ON THEN I'LL JUST JUMP TO ONE OTHER ITEM. IS -- IN ADDITION TO THE SIX POINT SIX MILLION -- WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF WILDLAND FIRE SMOKE. I WITHIN THE WILL. AND AGAIN. WHEN YOU BRING UP SOME OF THE MOST TOXIC AIR I'M PARAPHRASING HERE -- IT'S IMPACTING BOTH CAL FIRE AS WELL AS A MUNICIPAL FIREFIGHTERS ACROSS THE STATE -- AND THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS IN ON IN ADDITION TO THE SIX POINT SIX MILLION. FIVE MILLION TO BE ABLE TO LOOK. AT UP FOR THE IN FOR THE IMPACT OF OF SMOKE COMING FROM THE WILL BE AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE A TO DO PRETTY AT BE ABLE TO PROTECT THOSE MEN WOMEN OR THE FRONT LINES EACH AND EVERY DAY. HAVING TO BE ABLE TO BREATHE THAT -- IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE I'M I HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION AS HE WENT THIRTIES AND JUST ANY TO TIONAL REACTION CHIEF AND AGAIN. PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS IS ME THROWING STONES BECAUSE I AM SO GRATEFUL ON EMOTIONAL THINKING ABOUT RIGHT -- EVERYTHING A COW FIRES DONE BY. I ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON GETTING ADDITIONAL FOLKS ON THE GROUND. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE -- ANNA AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE RECOGNITION OF OF OF THE THE EMPLOYEE BECAUSE THAT REALLY IS IT IS THE ANSWER TO ALL OF THIS. EVEN TO THE POINT OF WE NEED MORE EMPLOYEES FOR THE ENGINES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE BECAUSE WERE STAFFED AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAT WE WERE -- AND WE ARE DOING AN ANALYSIS I A I KNOW. YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN -- THE FIRST GOAL IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN IS DOING THE ANALYSIS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE ARE SHORT -- RESOURCES AND WHERE THEY NEED TO BE THROUGH THAT INCLUDES AIR TANKERS THAT INCLUDES A NEW AIR TANKERS THE NEW HELICOPTERS. FIRE ENGINES CREWS -- AND ALL OF THE LIKE -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS AS A STANDALONE IT WAS IT WAS PUT INTO THE STRATEGIC PLAN THIS YEAR -- FOR CAL FIRE TO DO OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I I APPRECIATE -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES -- CONCERNS THAT THAT -- THAT IF WE DID SOMETHING UNDER THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION OF OF APRIL -- TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO DO WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO FOR ALL OF THIS WE CAN DO FIRE ENGINES UP FRONT BUT IT'S A WHOLE SYSTEM AS AS STATED BEFORE. AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE MISSION OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. AND WHILE I A I I EXPECT THAT -- YES SHOULD BE IN THIS IS COOL GOVERNMENT ALI DIFFERENT MISH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE COMING ARE VERY MUCH A PART OF THE SYSTEM BUT THEY ARE NOT THE CAL FIRE S. ARE A SYSTEM THAT THAT -- WE NEED TO ASSESS UNDER MY STRATEGIC PLAN ELEMENT. SEE ONE THIRTIES. WHEN YOU DO THE ANALYSIS CAN YOU? HELP ME OUT MAYBE EVERYBODY ON THE THE WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU GET IF THAT MONEY WERE SIMPLY PUT INTO PREVENTION I DON'T WANNA I I SEE THEN THE ITEM IS BEFORE US BUT IF WE TOOK FORTY MILLION WHICH IS. BEFORE US AND WE HAD THAT HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THIS NEW STAFF AND WE DIDN'T BY THE THE EQUIPMENT. AND WE KEPT AT THESE LOW LEVELS BUT WE PUT IN MORE STAFF TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND THEY WERE TASKED WITH THE PREVENTION. IS PREVENTION ON THE FORESTRY SIDE OF THE FORESTRY AND FIRE. PROTECTION WHAT TYPE OF OUTCOMES WITH THAT HAVE -- FOR THE REDUCTION OF THE FUEL AND THE PRESCRIBED DOSE PRESCRIBED BURNS IN THE INTO. YOU KNOW WE'RE WITH THIS IS THAT THIS IS AT THE SEVERAL DECADES OUR MONSTER THAT WE'VE CREATED HERE WITH THAT WITH DOING OUR SUPPRESSION WORK SO SO I'M NOT EXPECTING AN ANSWER NOW BUT WHEN YOU DO THE ANALYSIS. BECAUSE WE NEED YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES HERE AND WE HAVE YOUR PROPOSAL WE HAVE. OTHERS PROPOSAL WE HAVE ALTERNATIVES ON AB PRESCRIBER IN SOME PREVENTION PURPLE WHEN YOU DO THE ANALYSIS OF WE KNOW WHAT WEEK. WE GET IT'S IT'S HELPFUL. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE LAKE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND AND THAT WILL BE A PART OF IT AND I WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU IS. THE BEAUTY OF OF INVESTING IN CAL FIRE IS WHEN YOU PUT A FIRE SUPPRESSION RESOURCE INTO CAL FIRES -- TOOL BOX IT'S ALSO A FIRE PREVENTION TOOL -- IT DOES INSPECTIONS IT DOES -- PRESCRIBED BURNING AND FUELS REDUCTION PROJECT WORK IT DOES EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT IS OUR MISSION AND THAT'S WHY. THESE FIRE SUPPRESSION RESOURCES ARE HARD -- THEY HAVE DUAL PURPOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HOW. BOB DOLE THE PIGGY BACK I GUESS THOUGH ON ON YOUR TO YOUR QUESTION -- I GUESS MY MY MY CONCERN IS THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE EITHER OR RIGHT NOW. AND THAT WERE UNDER SIZING THIS ENTIRE -- PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET AND I KNOW THERE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONSEQUENCES OF OF OF DOING LESS. THEY HAVE REAL HUMAN IMPACT -- COMES TO THE THE WELL BEING OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WITHIN YOUR RANKS WHICH I THINK WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH. THIS JARRING STATISTICS ABOUT. IN A SUICIDE RATES OUTPACING MINA DUTY DEATH RIGHT NOW ON THE FRONT LINES -- SOBERING -- SO MY I ACTUALLY APPRECIATED. THE LA OWES. COMMENDATION WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT A BROADER BUDGET HEARING ABOUT. CONDUCTING AN ASSESSMENT TO IT -- INFORM FUTURE BUDGET DECISION. I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S A CRITICISM I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A CALL FOR MORE CREATIVITY IN A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THINKING HERE ABOUT. WHERE DO WE END UP? YOU KNOW WE GO YEAR TO YEAR ON WITHIN G. G. R. F. AND HAVE TO SORT OF FIGHT WITHIN THIS POT THAT. I DON'T THINK SHOULD BE THIS THIS SMALL AND I THINK IT'S A LITTLE ARBITRARY I THINK WE SHOULD ASSESS. THE ACTUAL SCOPE OF THE NEED IT MAY INCLUDE A C. ONE THIRTY AND IT MAY INCLUDE BEEFED UP MENTAL HEALTH AND IT MAY INCLUDE MORE ENGINES IT IS. I ACTUALLY THINK MORE IS JUST GOING TO BE THE ANSWER SO -- BUT WE HAVE TO KNOW NEED SO I I WOULD I I APPRECIATE THAT POINT I HOPE I HOPE WE DO GET THERE WERE. WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND. REALLY TRY TO EXPEDITE FUEL MANAGEMENT DOING YOUR JOB THINKING AHEAD AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THIS TRUCK OF THE BUDGET I SEE NO REASON WHY IT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME STANDING AS ARE OTHER CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED ITEMS WITHIN THE G. G. R. F.. OR WE'RE LOOKING AT TRANSIT INVESTMENTS -- THIS IS ALSO A LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND PEOPLE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE TO AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO KEEP A SAY SO THAT'S THE FIRST POINT I MAKE -- AT A HIGH LEVEL. CERTAINLY SECOND THE COMMENTS IN MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH COAST IN. AND I THINK YOU'RE HEARING AT THE HUNGER. FOR YET JUST NOT NOT UNDER SIZING WHAT THIS IS -- I I DID WANT TO DRILL DOWN TO SPECIFIC ITEMS THOUGH -- IN ADDITION SHE WHICH I HOPE OKAY I DON'T YOU HAVE A SHOT AT GETTING BACK TO US WITH SOMETHING THIS CYCLE I MEAN. THOUGHTS ON THAT SORT OF LONG TERM FOR MOVE ON I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'VE GOT YOUR YOU KNOW YOU YOU DON'T FORTY FIVE AIRPORTS STRIKE TEAMS CETERA BUT DO YOU HAVE TIME TO GO THINK AHEAD A LITTLE BIT BEFORE WE GET THROUGH THIS BUDGET CYCLE. THANK YOU FOR THE FOR THE A RECOGNITION OF OF MANY THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN ASKED TO DO -- DURING A CYCLE THAT THAT HAVE HAVE -- KIND OF TAKEN A LOT OF OUR ATTENTION -- WE WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS BUT BUT WHAT I WANT TO COME BACK TO IS -- MY STRATEGIC PLAN WAS DEVELOPED OVER A YEAR OF WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE ARE -- OUR CONTRACT COUNTIES AND AND AND THEN MY FIRE CHIEFS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED A COURSE THAT WE WANT TO TAKE AND WE WERE VERY METHODICAL COURSE -- TOWARD DOING AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT IT TAKES FOR CAL FIRE IN THE CONTRACT COUNTIES. TO TO RESPOND AS OUR MISSION REQUIRES US. TO IN THE S. R. A AND I REALLY REALLY DON'T WANT TO CUT THAT SHORT AND I DON'T WANT TO COME BACK TO YOU AND SAY YEAH I COULD USE THIRTY MORE ENGINES WHEN. IT MIGHT BE A NUMBER MUCH MUCH YOUR STAND THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF LOOK AT THIS INCREMENTALLY AND WHAT WE CAN BITE OFF AND AND AND ALL THOSE THINGS. I THINK THE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHY I'VE KIND OF BROUGHT TO YOU MY PRIORITIES OF THE HUMAN FACTOR FIRST AND I THINK BY ADDING THESE INDIVIDUALS -- WE'RE WE'RE WORKING IN THAT DIRECTION AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THAT DIRECTION -- BUT ALL OF THE EVERY PIECE THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A COMPREHENSIVE -- PIECE OF THE ANSWER AND I KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER PRESENTED IN FRONT OF YOU HERE TODAY. TIMING ON THAT STRATEGIC PLAN I KNOW YOU DID YOUR INITIAL DRAFT IN JANUARY YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER ROUND TO THAT. SO THE THE THE THE STRATEGIC PLANS OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR CAL FIRE -- IS NEW THIS JANUARY -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IT'S IT HOUSE US ON TRACK THROUGH THE FOR GOALS OF THAT ONE IS THE COR COTTON CORE CAPABILITIES ANALYSIS THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT'S THAT'S OUR OPERATIONAL KATE CAPABILITIES. WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE KIND OF BACK YOU KNOW BACKROOM KIND OF ASSESSMENT -- NUMBER THREE WHICH I'VE TOLD YOU IS MY MOST IN WELLNESS PEACE A FORCED DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTAINING A A A WORK FORCE -- INTO THE FUTURE THOSE THOSE ARE THE FOUR THAT THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL I'M I'M FOCUSED ON AS FAR AS THAT STRATEGIC PLAN. AND THE NUMBER ONE IS THIS ANALYSIS AND I I DON'T WANT TO CUT IT SHORT. I REALLY WANT TO DO IT RIGHT I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE RIGHT ANSWERS I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE THE OFF THE CUFF ANSWERS AND I KNOW THAT THAT -- WE ARE GOING TO A PLACE THAT IS IS MUCH MORE DEVASTATING AT POTENTIALLY AND AND SCARY THAN NINETEEN SEVENTY EVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED. AND SO I I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE RIGHT ANSWER. SO TIMING WISE THOUGH -- IS THERE -- FROM THE MAIN OUTLINE OF THE BUDGET CYCLE BUT IT JUST PROCEDURALLY YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR SECOND DRAFT I JUST WANNA GET CLEAR YOU'RE GONNA GO. YOU'RE GOING. TO THERE'S THE STRATEGIC PLAN PUBLISHED YOU GONNA DO AN UP THIS IS A BRAND NEW CITIES YOU PLAN IT IS IT ON THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE DEVELOP INTO THE LAST YEAR AND RIGHT GOES TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE THAT IS OUR PLAN GONNA TRY TO STICK WITHIN THAT. FRAMEWORK ANSWER TO BUILD OFF THAT OKAY UNDERSTOOD STARTED BE LABOR THAT POINT JUST TRYING TO GET PROCEDURALLY TIGHT HERE SO -- OTHER OTHER -- NOT SMALL ITEMS THERE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY BIG BUT I WOULD LOVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT. HOW YOUR THE WELLNESS PILOT? AND THE WORKERS COMP -- INTERRELATE -- THEY REQUIRE SAYS. BEST THING WE DO IS ACTUALLY I CAPACITY COULDN'T AGREE MORE RIGHT LESS STRESS OVERSTRETCHED. OF FIREFIGHTERS ONLINE IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO HEALTHIER HAPPIER FOLKS BUT IF I SEND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SORT OF A THE PUSH AND PULL OF SORT OF THAT OVERALL WELLNESS PROGRAM AND THEN WHEN THINGS REALLY DO GET BAD HAD ACTUALLY UTILIZE IF YOU HAVE AN INJURY. AND INJURIES ARE JUST TO THE BODY RIGHT THERE. THAT. YOU KNOW PSI'S IS ISRAEL -- IN A CROSS THAT THRESHOLD SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SORT OF SIZE THAT UP I SAW AN INCREASE DEALING WITH A FEW WORKERS COMP RELATED -- DISABILITY INDUSTRIAL DISABILITY LEAVE -- HOW DO YOU DO YOU DO YOU SEE UP TICK COMING IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF? CLAIMS BEING FILED ON THAT FRONT I KNOW YOU TRY TO MITIGATE THAT WITH THAT SORT OF BROADER WELLNESS BUT CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. HI. I DO SEE AN UPTICK IN WHAT I DON'T HAVE STATISTICS SHOW THAT -- BUT ANECDOTALLY I'M SEEING THAT AND IS AS WELL AS I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO REDUCE THAT. IN THE FUTURE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY -- BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE -- TO SAVE PEOPLE. KEEP THEM OUT OF THAT WORKERS COMP. A SITUATION KEEP THEM -- AS PRODUCTIVE -- EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHICH WE ALL NEED -- AND SO OF BAD THAT'S KIND OF THAT THAT'S WHERE I AM AYE AYE AYE IT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY RELATED TO A IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE OTHER ITEM IN HERE ABOUT THE INDUSTRY INDUSTRIAL -- YEAH FORGET THAT THE NAME OF THE FUN BUT THAT THERE THERE'S A COMEDY ODD. THE THE IDEA OF THE ENHANCE INDUSTRIAL DISABILITY LEAVE US AND IT'S OKAY SO WE'LL GET THEIR FINAL QUESTION ON THIS AND AND WE WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU THERE BECAUSE WE AGREE WITH GETTING RID OF THAT STIGMA. WE THINK THE WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE ADVANCE ON A POLICY LEVEL THIS YEAR A LOOK AT SORT OF THE PRESUMPTIONS UNDERLYING PTS I RELATED INJURIES AND WHETHER YOU SHOULD JUST. IF SOMEONE'S GONNA. THAT TO TO SORT OF AT THE PERSON REPORTING IS SUPPOSED TO SECOND GUESSING -- THE FRONTLINE PERSON WHO SAYS I GOT A PROBLEM IF THEY'RE GONNA COME REPORT WE WANT TO SAY WE BELIEVE YOU -- AS A MATTER OF COURSE OUT. BUT LAST PIECE HERE ARE FIRE DETECTION CAMPERS -- HERE THERE'S A SHORTAGE. THIS IS I I DON'T KNOW ROOM OR OR OR NOT BUT THERE'S THE THE NIGHT AT THROUGH THE MEANWHILE THAT WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THE UTILITIES FILE WITH YOU SEE. BY BEING REQUESTED IN THIS CYCLE. JUST ANECDOTALLY I'VE HEARD THEY'RE SORT OF A SUPPLY -- IMPEDIMENT RIGHT NOW. IT IS IN WANTS TO GET UP 290% COVERAGE BUT I CAN'T. THIS YEAR THEY'RE ONLY PUT IN SIXTY THREE CAMERAS IN PLACE HOW MUCH COVERAGE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IN YOUR AREA AND HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO THE RATE PAYER -- FUNDED WILDFIRE AT FIRE CAMERAS THAT ARE GOING ON WITHIN UTILITY JURISDICTION ARE YOU TRYING TO COVER GROUND THAT THEY'RENOT ON ARE YOU ON THE SAME POLES AND WIRES AT THEIR OWN JUST CAN YOU. GOOD POINT GOOD POINT -- AND WE ARE WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT HIM TO CLOSE TOGETHER -- WILL IDENTIFY THE AREAS WHERE WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE CAMERAS THAT WE NEED CAMERAS -- THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY CAMERAS LE PLUS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY -- UTILIZING THROUGHOUT THE STATE MOST OF THOSE ARE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE AND THEN IN THE TAHOE BASIN. SO THIS WOULD EXPAND THE CAPABILITY WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR THOSE HOLES -- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO PUT THEM ON OUR OUR CURRENT LOOKOUT LOCATIONS WHERE -- WE HAVE SOMETIMES VOLUNTEER STAFF SOMETIMES NO STAFF BUT IF WE HAVE A A CAMERA ON A LOOK OUT THAT'S BEEN THERE. FOR YOU KNOW EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS -- WE FEEL THAT THAT'S STILL A GOOD PLACE A GOOD HIGH POINT TO BE ABLE TO TO LOOK OUT ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE AND AND MAKE -- SOME ASSESSMENT OF THE SMOKE REALLY THESE CAMERAS WHILE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT DETECTION TOOLS A AS AS OF KIND OF WE'VE. LEARNED THROUGH READ THROUGH USE OF THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD SO AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE USING THE MOUSE. AND TO NOTHING YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT SHORTAGE I IKEEP HEARING THAT THERE'S NON ON IF ACTION ON THE FIREFLY YES BY SIDE. I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT BUT I'LL LOOK INTO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE FOR THANK YOU. ANOTHER QUESTION BY SEN REQUIRE CAN I ASK YOU BEFORE WE GET TO THE TANK AIR TANKER ON THE CAMERA -- DETECTION WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A LOTS OF SENSORS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE HAVE SENSORS FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE WE HAVE SENSORS FOR AIR QUALITY WE HAVE WE HAVE WEATHER STATIONS WE HAVE ALL THESE. SENSE IS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND CAMERAS THAT -- PRE EXISTING AND IT MAY BE A SOFTWARE. A CHALLENGE OR OPPORTUNITY THERE AT THAT ALL THESE DIFFERENT DEVICES THAT ARE OUT THERE THINKING COMMUNICATE BECAUSE GET TO SPLIT SENATOR STERN WAS ALLUDING TO IS THAT IF WE MAXIMIZE WHAT'S ALREADY THERE IT MAY NOT BE THE BEST. LOCATION FOR THE VIEW THE FIRE. CAN ALLEN WHATEVER WHATEVER BUT IT'S A GOOD ONE THAT MADE NEED TO BE AUGMENTED AS WE GO WHEN THEY'RE IN AS WE LOOK AT OUR PRECIOUS RESOURCES AS WE'RE GONNA HOLD THE MATTER SOWHEN WE COME BACK. IT WOULD BE I KNOW THAT WE'VE TALK WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HAZARDOUS WASTE IN THE AIR QUALITY AND THE WEATHER PEOPLE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY CAN USE THE SAME. AREAS JUST A SOFTWARE AUGMENTATION THAT COULD GIVE YOU A SMOKE DETECTION FOR INSTANCE SENATOR -- MCGUIRE YOU HAVE AN AIR TANKER QUESTION. SENATOR MAKE SURE I'M ON THE SAME PAGE. WITH. YOU CHIEF AND OBVIOUSLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR FIRST FOR NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THIRTEEN MILLION [inaudible] THIS. THANKS. FOR IT FOR NINETEEN TWENTY ODD TO BE ABLE TO THE MOVE ON THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM IT'S IT'S THIRTEEN MILLION. IS WHAT'S BEING OUT YES AND THAT'S A COMBINATION OF SORT OF RAMPING UP STAFF AND THEN SOME I'M SORT OF BEGINNING SOME CAPITAL YET CAPACITY BUILDING EXACTLY GETTING FACILITIES ONLINE TO BE ABLE. TO I MOVED TO SEE WHEN THIRTIES AS SOON AS THEY BECOME UP AS SOON AS THEY'RE DELIVERED -- TO INSTALLATIONS ARE DIFFERENCE ARE INSTALLED AND AND SO WE WANT TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING THEN JUST. LOOKING AT ON GOING TO ONGOING WILL BE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY MILLION. THAT'S CORRECT IN IS THAT. OPERATION MAINTENANCE IS THAT TAKING ACCOUNT ADDITIONAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND NEEDING TO BE A BILL THAT NEEDS TO CAN YOU JUST WALK US THROUGH THAT -- SO BROADLY SPEAKING THERE'S A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS WITH IT NOT FIFTY MILLION SO THERE'S AND THAT SORT OF THE COSTS OF OF OPERATING THE ACTUAL PLANES THEMSELVES AND THAT COMES DOWN TO COSTS FOR PILOTS. I'M AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT IT AS THREE PILOTS -- AND AND THERE'S ALSO SORT OF MAINTENANCE NEEDS AND NOT COMES DOWN TO BOTH PARTS FOR THE AIRCRAFT WHICH WILL BE GREATLY INCREASED BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ULTIMATELY A LARGER AND LARGER PLATFORM I'M DOWN IN THE CURRENT S. TWO T. AIR TANKERS THAT WE HAVE THAT THEY HAVE AND THAT THEY'RE SORT OF OPERATING -- AND THEN THEY'RE SORT OF THE GROUND CREW STAFFING THAT'S RELATED TO THAT WHICH I'M SORT OF IS THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND LOADING THE RETIRED AND AND SO THAT THAT SORT OF I THINK BROADLY COVERS AND AND AND THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM SO WE NEED TO BUILD. CAPACITY WITHIN THE PROGRAM IN NONE OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IT -- DOLLARS IN THE CREWS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED AND THIS IS IN THE WORLD DEAL WITH IN A BIT BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO. WITH ANY -- PREPARING HIS HE WENT THIRTIES THAT THIRTEEN MILLION IS STRICTLY FOR THOSE NEW AIRPLANES. YES IT IS YEAH I'VE I'M JUST CAN I JUST WANNA CLEAR FISERV WHAT WHAT THE WAY I FORGET WHICH WHICH I DO MAYES -- PROPOSING THIS FACILITIES ARE PARA MAINTENANCE -- I WOULD SAY THAT THE PROBABLY THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AT AT TELL FARES -- TECH PIECES MORE BROADLY ARE SORT OF IN TERMS OF THEIR FACILITIES EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF WHERE THOSE DOLLARS TO BE DEDICATED. RELATED TO THAT THIS THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THE C. ONE THIRTIES THIS REQUEST -- WE WERE NOT RAPPING AND OTHER -- SPECIAL REPAIRS THAT WE MIGHT NEED -- AND BUT THERE ARE -- MODIFICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE. RELATED -- TO PILOTS QUARTERS NEEDED FOR HAVING THREE INDIVIDUALS A CREW OF THREE IT'S ONE PILOT AND AND THEN AND THEN ALSO -- SOME OF THE RAMP SPACE AND THINGS NEED TO BE EXPANDED BECAUSE IT'S A MUCH BIGGER AIRCRAFT AND AND JUST MANEUVERING IT AROUND -- REQUIRES MORE SPACE AND SO THERE'S THOSE KIND OF COSTS FOR UTILIZING THIS TYPE OF AIR TANKER. IN THE FUTURE OF THIS INDEED HERE IN THIRTY SECONDS AND QUICK CLOSING COMMENT ON NAY IN GENERAL IS THAT LOOK. I THINK MY BOTTOM LINE IS UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S UP TO LEGISLATURE NOW TO BE A C. FOR GOING TO BE ABLE. TO ADD TO WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED BY -- DEPARTMENT FINANCING THE GOVERNOR. AND I DO NOT THINK WE NEED A STEP. YOU BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT WE ARE SHORTER PERSONNEL IN SHORT ON ENGINES. I THINK WITH THAT SAID YOU SHOW US IS. HOW SHORT WE ARE? SO -- AND I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT A STUDIES GONNA COME BACK SAYING THAT WE ARE -- JUST TWENTY THREE SHORT. I'M AS WE HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY STATUS QUO STAFFING FOR THE GREATER PART OF FORTY YEARS AND NOW WE'VE JUST STARTED RAMPING UP.

HE YES EIGHT SO THE BILLS HAVE ONLY BEEN INACTIVE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO WE WE YOUR BUT USING HEALTH FIRES ESTIMATE THAT THEY PROVIDED -- AND NOT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT HOWEVER YOU KNOW OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE TO COME NEXT YEAR AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE THREE YEARS OF DATA -- COME FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL POTENTIALLY FOR ON GOING RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE DEMAND FOR THE INCREASE AND SO THE CONTINGENCY. THE CHIEF IS TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S BILL BUT THAT WOULD BE BUILT INTO THE THIS CURRENT BUDGET CYCLE. THERE'S THE FOUR POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND WHICH WERE BUILDING INTO THE BUDGET AND THEN THERE WOULD BE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WITHIN THE THE ITEMS THAT ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS.

UP PORTION ON ISSUE NUMBER TEN ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT. SEEN AND WE HAVE A MOTION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LIKE HOW SCHEME BY. CHANCE MCGUIRE [inaudible] MORNING [inaudible] STERN. THAT MATTERS APPROVED FOUR ZERO LET'S MOVE TO OUR FACILITIES REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE AS SET FORTH IN ISSUE NUMBER. ELEVEN OKAY THANK YOU. A CAL FIRE IS REQUESTING A NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND A TWENTY TWO POINT THREE POSITIONS IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- FOR TO BUILD THE CAPACITY NEEDED TO UNDERTAKE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. AND EFFECTIVELY. AND EFFICIENTLY. MAINTAIN OVER TWO THOUSAND STRUCTURES ON A FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- WE ARE. THIS IS IT THIS IS KEY TO REDUCING OUR BACKLOG OF OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENSURING THAT WE DON'T HAVE -- FACILITIES THAT THAT FALL IN SUCH DISREPAIR THAT THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO BE -- MAINTAINED AT SOME POINT. THE THE STAFFING AND FUNDING. REALLY WILL -- HELP US TO AVOID GREATER ACCUMULATION OF THE DEFERRED MAISCH MAINTENANCE AS I MENTIONED -- AND HELP US -- TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'LL GET TO ON THE ON FUTURE [inaudible] ISSUE [inaudible] THAT'S IT. HAVE A QUESTION OF WHEN IT APPEAR INSENSITIVE HERE BUT BUT ON SOME OF THE STRUCTURES THAT YOU HAVE THIS IS FIRE FIGHTING. APPARATUS EQUIPMENT. WIRE THE STRUCTURES REQUIRED TO BE EIGHTY A COMPLIANT OR ARE THEY IN A WERE UP IN. AN AREA WE HAVE A HELIPAD THAT. WHAT WOULD BE THE ACCESS THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE TO THAT FACILITY? THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION AND THESE ARE PUBLIC FACILITIES AND A A I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY BUT IN MY UPBRINGING I I REMEMBER. A TIME WHEN -- MY DAD WOULD TAKE ME TO THE FIRE STATION AND ALLOW ME TO SEE AND TALK TO THE FIREFIGHTERS AND GET AROUND. AND IT WAS A PUBLIC OPENS OPEN SPACE. AND SO SO WE DO HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS -- FREELY THOSE SPACES AND WE DO HAVE. A SPECIAL NEEDS OF SOME OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHO WHO -- ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE AT THOSE LOCATIONS FOR THEIR WORK -- FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PERSPECTIVE AND OTHER THINGS AND AND WE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- THEM ACCESS TO THOSE PLACES TO FOR ALL TWO THOUSAND STRUCTURES. I MEAN I I GET THE HOMETOWN FIRE STATION AND I GET THAT CALIFORNIA'S XIN RIGHT OFF THE FREEWAY AND ON URBAN INTERFACE AREA BUT THERE ARE. TWO THOUSAND STRUCTURES THAT OUR WAREHOUSES SOMEPLACE IN STORAGE FACILITIES IN AND BUNKHOUSES THAT ARE THERE FOR THE PEOPLE IS THAT I MEAN. I COULD JUST ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN I DON'T WANT. TO APPEAR INSENSITIVE BUT I JUST. IT SEEMS LIKE OF THE TWO THOUSAND STRUCTURES SOME OF THEM. ARE NOT. PUBLIC AS WE WOULD SAY THERE'S NO PEOPLE HAVE NO BUSINESS GOING INTO THOSE LIKE THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS GOING INTO CHP FACILITY. I MEAN JUST JUST SAYING. THANK YOU SIR CAN ORDER POP UP IN HERE MY NAME'S MIKE DUGGAN MISSILE ENGINEER WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND AS FAR AS OUR ACCESSIBILITY -- REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY SPEAKING EVEN WAREHOUSES DO NEED ACCESSIBILITY TO THEM -- THE SOME AREAS THAT ARE QUITE OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T NEED TO PROVIDE THAT WOULD BE LOOK OUTS YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ELEVATORS IN THEM -- BUT AIR FIRE STATIONS THE GENERAL MAJORITY OF OUR LOCATIONS ARE PUBLIC FACILITIES OR COULD BE USED IN A MERCY AS A PUBLIC FACILITY. SO -- YEAH WE HAVE TO PROVIDE EIGHTY BATHROOMS SENSIBILITY INTO THE FACILITY -- A IF WE HAVE SOME MAJOR ELEVATION DIFFERENCES UP -- TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE FACILITY SO THE PUBLIC CAN MAKE ACCESS AND APPLY FOR PERMITS OR EVEN SCHOOL CHILDREN INTO THE APPARATUS BAY. OF THOSE HAVE TO COMPLY AS WELL THE MIND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARM. SO THIS SIX NINE POINT FIVE MILLION. IN THE BUDGET YEAR WERE LOOKING AT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUT SUGGESTS THAT THE PROJECTED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS OVER A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO WHY ARE YOU ONLY SEEKING. THAT PORTION OF IT IN MAY BE RELATED TO THAT QUESTION. IS THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON INCLUDING INTERESTING HOW YOU DEAL WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OVER TIME. DURING THE SCOPE OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN. THANK YOU SENATOR EN EL AND I'LL I'LL TOUCH THE THE PREFERS PART OF THAT ARE THE SECOND PART OF THAT FIRST -- THE STRATEGIC PLAN WILL BE LOOKING AT ALL ASPECTS OF OF THE NEEDS FOR OPERATIONALLY -- MEETING OUR MISSION SO YOU THE ANSWER TO THAT PART OF THE QUESTION IS YOU YES -- TO THE STRATEGIC PLAN IN A MINUTE. YOU'RE BACK -- TO MIKE DUGGAN. SO -- THE IDENTIFIED HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND BACKLOGS DEFERRED SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT -- WE'RE KICKING DOWN THE ROAD. BASICALLY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS ON AND WE'RE STILL ABLE -- TO BUT WE'RE BUDGETING IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SELF --% BY WORKING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'VE IDENTIFIED I THINK OUR CAPABILITIES -- WITH STAFF -- THAT ARE PERMANENT AND CURRENTLY -- WERE ALSO OPERATING WITH ARTISTS AND AND WHEN THE TERM STAFF AND THAT'S THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN FOR OVER A DECADE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO TACKLE -- MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS -- ANYWAY POSSIBLE WITH MANY DIFFERENT TOOLS -- WHAT WE SEE AS FAR AS ON THE NON PERMANENT STAFF -- DUE -- TO AND FIRE SOMEPLACE -- WE WERE NOT ABLE -- TO ACTUALLY GET THESE PEOPLE AND WE STILL HAVE THE NEED THE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FACILITIES STATEWIDE -- COVER FIRE STATIONS AIR ATTACK BASES AND WE'RE JUST COMMAND CENTERS LOOK OUT AS FAR AS COM -- AND OUR PLACE FULL JUST ON THE REPAIRS WERE ALSO GIVEN AT JUST LIKE YOU'D MENTIONED -- AS FAR AS THE FAR WATCH CAMERAS THOSE ARE INSTALLED IN OUR FACILITIES. EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT REALLY REQUIRED THAT WE HAVE TO DO THEM WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T INTERFERE WITH COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES. AS FAR AS RADIO FREQUENCY -- THAT THEY'RE MOUNTED PROPERLY THAT THE DAIRY TIE INTO OUR MERCY COMMAND CENTERS AND BECAUSE ANOTHER PROBLEM -- EVEN DURING EMERGENCIES -- AND FIRES AND INCIDENTS IN EARTHQUAKES -- WERE CALLED UPON TO GO GET OUR STANDARD AGAIN AND THE CAMP FIRE -- WE WERE WITHOUT POWER AND WATER -- SO WE HAD TO PROVIDE THAT -- WE ALSO HOPE OUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHILE WE'RE THERE SO IF WE'RE ABLE -- TO A COMPLETE OUR MISSION GETTING OUR STATIONS BACK ONLINE -- WILL WILL GO HELP WITH THE COUNTY AND CITY AS FAR AS INSPECTIONS ANYWAY THAT WE CAN'T. AS LONG. A PART OF IT IS CAPACITY HOW MUCH YOU CAN. THE VOTE A MORNING FLA OUR FINANCE HAS A COMMENT ON THIS. SURE IS SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THERE'S REALLY TWO PIECES THERE'S I'M DEPARTMENTS. PUTTING IN ENOUGH ONGOING MAINTENANCE FUNDING AND SO THEN IT GETS DEFERRED AND THEN YOU END UP WITH A BIG BACKLOG IN SO THAT I THINK HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION THAT NUMBER YOU REFERENCE. WOULD BE -- CAL FIRES BACKLOG IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAVE LARGE BACKLOGS AS WELL THERE'S TWO WAYS OF ADDRESSING THAT ONE IS WHAT'S IN THIS PROPOSAL HERE WHICH IS. INCREASE YOUR ON GOING MAINTENANCE -- AT FINDING IT SO THAT AND GROWING YOUR BACKLOG ON THE OTHER WAY TO ADDRESS IT WOULD BE BY PUTTING IN A ONE TIME FINDS TO TO TAKE IT DOWN THAT BACKLOG. THERE'S A SEPARATE PROPOSAL AND I WANT TO SAY IT WAS HER LAST WEEK BUT I'M NOT ENTIRELY POSITIVE OR MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR IT LATER ANYWAYS IT'S NOT ON TODAY. AND FOR AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING FOR ALL THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND CAL FIRE WOULD GET SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM THAT SO THAT'S GOING TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT BACKLOG THAT'S ACCUMULATED. THIS PROPOSAL -- OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO REALLY PREVENT THE BACKLOG FROM. I AM IN NO CONTINUING TO GROW IN THE FUTURE I WOULD HIGHLIGHT I'M ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL THAT ISN'T ON THE AGENDA FOR TODAY BUT WE DO HAVE A RECOMMENDATION THERE -- TO ENSURE THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE REPORTING BACK ON WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE SIZE OF THEIR BACKLOG AS WELL AS HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THESE OF THE OTHER ONE TIME FUNDS WHICH IS A SEPARATE PROPOSAL. AND AND IT JUST THAT KIND OF INFORMATION WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO EVALUATE NOT ONLY THAT PROPOSAL BUT THESE SORTS OF PROPOSALS WHERE. ARE THEY REALLY MEETING THE GOALS AT OF STOPPING THE INCREASE IN THE GROWTH OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND WHICH WOULD BE SORT OF THE GOAL OF THIS TYPE OF A PROPOSAL. THIS SORT OF THING IS SOMETHING THAT OUR OFFICE HAS RECOMMENDED THAT DEPARTMENTS DUE TO INCREASE THEIR ON GOING FUNDING FOR IT FOR FACILITIES MAINTENANCE SO THAT. YOU DON'T END UP WITH A BACKLOG WHICH ENDS UP BEING MUCH MORE COSTLY AND CAN LEAD. TO TURN THE SCENE -- NO IT'S NO LONGER MAINTENANCE NOW YOU HAVE TO DO MARX AND X. UNDERSTANDING AS A LOT OF THIS WORK IS AND YET NOT NOT THAT IT WOULD NECESSARILY EXCLUDE EIGHTY EIGHT WORK BUT A LOT OF IT WOULD BE AND YOU KNOW EACH BACK REPAIRS AND ROOF REPAIRS AND AND JUST. GENERAL CONDITION OF THE FACILITIES. AND AND THAT THAT WOULD GO BEYOND THAT AND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT ACCUMULATED WORK. SURE I I ONLY WENT OUT IS IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY AT EVEN TO ADDRESS THE IN ANY GROWTH IN THE IN THE BACKLOG IN THE FUTURE SO IT'S PUTTING IN THAT ONGOING MAINTENANCE FUNDING SO THAT TELL FIRES IN A POSITION TO DEAL WITH SORT OF THIS. BEFORE THEY BECOME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE [inaudible] THUNDERSTORMS. THANK YOU. FOLLOWING UP ON IN ORDER FOR FIND LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT THE PROJECTS WOULD BE HERE I I SAW H. BACK BUT ALSO. MAKE SOME ELECTRICAL WORK IN -- ON THE ENERGY SIDE OF YOUR SYSTEMS I KNOW. YOUR NOT A IMMUNE FROM AG THE GREAT ISSUES WE'VE BEEN HAVING IN WE LOSE POWER PEOPLE GET HURT -- I I'M WONDERING HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING. THAT ISSUE THE RESILIENCY OF YOUR FACILITIES -- IT IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS WE COULD SEE GOING FORWARD. IF I MIGHT ADD -- NEAR THE ABILITY. FOR CAL FIRE AND FRANKLY ALL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THE STATE THAT HAVE CRUCIAL PUBLIC SERVICE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE OFF CREATED. FOR DAYS ON END POTENTIALLY DURING THE CYCLES. THIS IS A MAJOR PRAYER. WHAT'S THAT IS THAT MISSION A PART OF HOW YOU ALL ARE GOING TO BE UNDERTAKING THIS MAINTENANCE SERVER UPGRADE EFFORT. COMMENTS. BOB I WOULD SAY WE TAKE. TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION -- WHENEVER WE CAN AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE -- CHP WAS SURPLUS SING GENERATORS THEY BOUGHT TWO FOR EACH OF THEIR FACILITIES -- ONE WAS A SPARE -- THEY FOUND THAT THEY DIDN'T USE THEM FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS SO THEY SURPLUS THEM SO WE WENT AND AND GATHERS MANY AS WE COULD SO WE CAN PUT HIM AT FIRE STATIONS THE MAJORITY OF OUR FIRE STATIONS ARE NOT. GENERATOR SUPPORTED SO ALL THE NEW CAPITAL PROJECTS ARE -- MOST OF OUR FACILITIES WERE BILL PRIOR TO NINETEEN SIXTY SO -- WHAT HOW WE REMAIN OP NO POWER TO THE SITE BUT THERE'S POWER TO THE RADIOS AS FAR AS IN THE ENGINES -- SO WE CAN STILL. MAIN CONTACT ON THAT AND IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE THEN WE'LL GO TO TEMPORARILY SET UP A GENERATOR. I AND WE DO THAT AT THE CAMPFIRE -- AS WELL AND WE ALSO IDENTIFIED SUPPORT FUNDS -- FOR I BELIEVE TWO STATIONS TO NOW HAVE GENERATORS UP IN PARADISE -- I THE PARADISE AREA -- SO YES THAT WERE TRYING TO NIBBLE AWAY AS BEST WE CAN BECAUSE WE REALIZE WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. I WOULD JUST ADD THOUGH MY CONCERNS WE WENT THROUGH THIS THIS GENERATOR GAME. DOWN AND WE'LL SEE. FEEL THE PAIN IT TOO YOU'VE GOT TO STOCKPILE FUEL. I'M WINNER WHEN WE GET PAST THIS DIESEL GENERATOR CHASING THE FUEL AND TRY TO GET THAN FUEL PASSED FIRE LINES AND BLOCKAGES WE WE WE LITERALLY HAD T HAVE. ENTIRE FUEL CONVOYS TRY TO FEED THEM THE GENERATOR BUT THE FIRES GOING AND THEN THERE'S BLOCKADES IN. AND I WENT WHY AREN'T WE REALIZING THE CLEAN ENERGY POTENTIAL AT ALL THESE FACILITIES IN TRYING TO GET OURSELVES GRADE RESILIENT. GOING TO BATTERY BACK UP LOOKING AT MY GROUP GRADES YOU KNOW ON SITE GENERATION THAT'S NOT GOING. TO LIKE REQUIRE BUDGET DIESEL OR PROPANE TO GET SHIPPED IN IS THAT IS THAT SOME YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT -- DEFINITELY -- ACTUALLY DEPARTMENT WELL -- TRAINED AND THE WASTER -- THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT OUR REMOTE LOCATIONS AS FAR AS CAMPS AND AND I'D SAY TO A LESSER EXTENT STATE FORCE. FOR A DEVELOPING -- POWER OUT REMOTE AREAS TO TO ASSIST US -- MOSTLY -- WE HAVE ONE FIRE STATION TECHNICAL SERVICES -- MY UNIT OUT OF READING -- PUT UP -- SOLAR AT AT THE FIRE STATION JUST OUTSIDE READING. WE'RE TRYING TO COMBAT THAT BECAUSE WE DO REALIZE IT SOMETIMES WERE WITHOUT POWER RESOURCES WATER EVEN -- FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME SO WE DO HAVE -- LARGE -- STORY FUEL -- THAT'S PRIMARILY FOR THE APPARATUS BUT WE CAN ALSO USE THAT FOR GENERATORS AND AIR RESOURCES BOARD SOMETIMES WILL NOT PERMIT THAT SO. WE'VE LOOK AT PROPANE -- WE HAVE. TO I'LL ACTUALLY HAVE TO FIRE STATIONS -- OR ACTUALLY IT'S A COMBINATION OF THREE AND THE THE CURRENT BUDGET THAT ARE OFF GRID -- WILBUR SPRINGS HAMID ARE PERMITS SPRINGS AND SKULL CREEK THAT ARE COMBINATIONS. WHICH THEY DO HAVE A SMALL GENERATOR BUT ITS BATTERY BACKUP INSULAR. SO THE ONE THEY'RE JUST ASK IS TO LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ALL AND PARTNERING TO GET CREATIVE ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THIS MONEY GO AS FAR AS WE CAN. BUT THERE IS IN A CREATIVE PPA WHERE YOU GUYS ARE ABLE. TO PULL PURCHASE CLEAN BACKUP POWER EVEN MICRO GREENS FOR YOUR SYSTEMS BUT ALSO YOU KNOW. LOOKING FORWARD. HOW HOW HOW VULNERABLE ARE IS YOUR YSTEM GOING TO BE SO GETTING A LITTLE BIT DATA BACK ABOUT? YOU KNOW WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE BACK UP POWER IN PLACE AND WHERE YOU DO AND HOW MUCH COVERAGE WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF IT. I KNOW THEY'RE LIKE ENERGY SERVICE CAUGHT -- BUT A CALM S. GOES ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF AGREEMENTS WE CAN SORT OF FOR THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE BALL PURCHASED THIS STUFF TO ESCO -- CONTRACTS TO THE DEPARTMENT JOURNAL SERVICES IN THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE HAD IS -- EVEN ON OUR LARGEST FACILITIES -- THERE'S NOT -- I I SEE THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A OF PRISON PERHAPS YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE ALMOST A COMMUNITY YEARS SUPPLYING -- AID THE CONVERSION OF THAT IS IS -- BIG DOLLAR SAVINGS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A FIRE STATION -- IT DOESN'T APPEAR. TO GET THE INTEREST OF THE DEPARTMENT SIR -- GENERAL SERVICES TO ALLOW US TO EVEN BUNDLE OF FIRE STATIONS TO DO THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE USUALLY SO REMOTE -- BASICALLY THE MAJORITY OF OUR FIRE STATIONS ARE BASICALLY RANCH STYLE HOUSES OUT IN THE FAR REACHES OF THE STATE. BURGER FRIES COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE SPECIFIC FACILITIES FRIEND AND HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT POWER ANYTHING. WE CAN DO HERE. I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE AN H. ISSUE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY. IT'S IT'S BIG PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE AROUND THE STATE'S ARE JUST CURIOUS YEAH I ENTER SHARPER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE DEFINITELY SHARE YOUR SAME INTEREST MORE LOOKING AT THE OUR ENTIRE CAPITAL PORTFOLIO. AND I THINK THE REAL ISSUE IS IS BEING FOR THE BACK IS THIS THE BEST PLACE TO EVEN PUT AN ESCROW TYPE DOLLARS AND ALSO SOME OF OUR OTHER AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH UTILITY COMPANIES AND OTHER PARTIES THAT WILL COME IN AND THEN. THEY'LL PUT A BIG SOLAR FIELDS AND THEN THEY GET TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE BACK WHATEVER WE DON'T USE. SO THESE PROJECTS ARE SMALL ENOUGH THAT THE BANG FOR THE BUCK REALLY ISN'T THERE SO IT'S IN THE BETTER INTEREST OF THE STATE JUST TO CASH FIND OUT OUR OWN SOLAR PANELS AND NOT DO THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS. WHICH WE ARE DEFINITELY DOING AND LOOKING AT THE WE LOOK IT'S STRATEGIES IS THAT'S GO THE BEST ROUTE IT MEANS THAT MAY BE AN INAPPROPRIATE CONTRACTING MECHANISM I'M SURE TO GET AT THE UNDERLYING RESILIENCY AND SAY AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO SUCK ABOUT MUCH -- THESE ARE THE GENERATORS AND TRY TO STOCKPILE FUEL SITUACIóN SAID THE THE THE PRODUCT ITSELF SEEMS LIKE. I DON'T REAL ISSUE YEAH YEAH AND ME AGREE AND SOME OF THEIR MINOR PROJECTS THAT THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING I HAVE BEEN PUTTING SOLAR PANELS ON FACILITIES IN THE MORE WE CAN DO THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT THE CURRENT WE SHARE THE SAME INTEREST ALL LEAVE. A JUST LEAVE YOU WITH. BATTERIES IS LEAVE YOU WITH THAT AND AND IN THE GENERATIONS ONE PIECE BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT SENIOR CARE FACILITIES WERE LOOKING AT A CRITICAL WATER PUMPING STATIONS THIS IS AN ISSUE AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE WANT TO BE SAFE. SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP FACILITATE THAT EVEN IF IT'S ABOUT WORKING WITH UTILITIES TIME IS THERE A LITTLE RESIDENT RETICENT ON BEHIND THE METER -- GENERATION AND I CAN GET COMPLICATED SIZING INPUT SOME OF THE LEAD TO HELP YOUR WORK THANK YOU FOR THE AND WHAT THAT WILL MOVE TO FIREWORKS. AND LOCAL THAT MATTER OPEN -- WE'RE GOING TO THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL. AFTER PRESENTATION HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. FIREWORKS MANAGEMENT DISPOSAL -- I'M I'M ACTUALLY ARE YOU GOOD WITH THIS. TAKING OVER ON THE SIDE. THANK YOU -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CALLS FOR THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. THIS PROBLEM -- I'M SURE IN IN YOUR DISTRICTS YOU YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS ON THE FOURTH OF JULY IT SEEMS TO BE INCREASING EVERY YEAR. NOW WE HAVE THIS INFLUX OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS THAT COMES AND FROM OUT OF STATE IT COMES IN U. P. S.. BUT WE HAVE MANUFACTURING OF FIREWORKS THAT IT'S OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IT'S OVERWHELMING THE RESOURCES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE IN FACT IN SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT EVEN IN FORCING ANYMORE. IN PRIMARILY BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A PLACE OR THERE HASN'T BEEN CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR THE DISPOSAL OF SEIZE FIREWORKS. SO THEY GO IN AND LOCAL SCHOOL AND SEES THE FIREWORKS AND THEN -- TO COME AND PICK THEM UP AND TAKE THEM TO A AN OUT OF STATE LOCATION -- THROUGH A CONTRACT AND IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING SO -- WE'VE TRIED MANY MANY ATTEMPTS A MINI CREATED THE TEMPS -- AND HERE WE ARE. REQUESTING GENERAL FUND. LET ME THROW ANOTHER CREATIVE -- ATTEMPT WOULD BE AS A EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY WE WE HAVE THIS MODELS THAT SAYS IF YOU PRODUCE THE ITEMS YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROPOSAL. SO WE HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME YOU KNOW WE'RE CALIFORNIA IF THERE ARE SOME. LEGAL FIREWORKS ELSEWHERE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE ILLEGAL HERE AND WE AND I USED TO CHAIR. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY SO I'M. FULLY AWARE OF MASTERS HAS HIS WAYS BUT IF WE WERE ABLE TO REQUIRE THE PRODUCERS IF WE HAD A POLICY THAT WE HAD OF THE PRODUCERS. THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DISPOSE OF THIS LIKE WE WOULD WE WOULD DO IN PLASTIC SIR CARPET OR WHERE WHATEVER. THAT IS A MODEL THAT WE HAVEN'T TRIED THEM JUST. THROWING IT OUT THERE BECAUSE WE GO THROUGH THESE THINGS SAVE CERTAINLY SPARK IDEAS SO RATHER THAN. PAYING THREE POINT SIX MILLION TO DISPOSE OF THEM WE HAVE THE PRODUCERS COMING GET THEIR STUFF AND TAKE IT OUT OF THEY PAY TAKE IT OUT THEY'VE GOT AN INCENTIVE. BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE THEY CAN RESELL THESE THINGS RIGHT. I MEAN THESE ARE DID OR NOT THEY'RE NOT DISPOSING OF PICKING UP THE OTHER STUFF HAVE WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE STAFF REPORT DIDN'T SEE THAT IDEA. HAS THAT EVER BEEN DOES YES YEAH YEAH WE YES WE'VE TRIED THAT SIR. IN FACT THE LAST TWO BUDGET CYCLES WE TRIED TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY AND LOCAL FIRE AND LOW AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ON A EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM. AND WE COULD NEVER -- WE COULD NEVER GET IT OFF THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK -- WHETHER IT WAS INDUSTRY THAT WAS BALKING AT IT BECAUSE THEY SELL SAFE AND SANE FIREWORKS IN THE STATE AND THEY WERE GOING TO BE ASKED TO SUBSIDIZE ALL OF THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY THAT WAS OCCURRING -- AND THEIR CONCERNS WERE THE PRODUCTS THAT WERE BEING SEASON WHETHER OR NOT THEY'D BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO RESELL THEM. IN ANOTHER LOCATION AND RECOUP THEIR COST OR OR ABSORB SOME LIABILITY BECAUSE OF THAT. SO WE WORKED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR TWO YEARS TO BUDGET CYCLES TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A MODEL AND WE JUST COULD NEVER GET IT THROUGH. THE LEGISLATURE AS I RECALL IT ALSO EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT RE PURPOSING OF OF THE FIREWORKS AND IN SOME OF OUR MEETING SO -- WE WE HAVE WE HAVE MADE AN ATTEMPT. ALEJO BEFORE GET TO MY COLLEAGUES. WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS -- PROPOSAL I IT SEEMS REASONABLE AND WE JUST KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T. FOR CLOSE THE OPTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE AT A FUTURE TIME IF YOU DO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT FUNDING MECHANISM MORE OR WAY OF HANDLING THIS SO YOU COULD ALWAYS MAKE THAT CHANGE BUT THIS WOULD AT LEAST ADDRESS THE I'M EXISTING [inaudible] CENTER STERN. THANKS I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. THE CHIEF I A I WAS READY TO MOVE THAT LEGISLATION LAST YEAR ACTUALLY I WOULD JUST. URGE YOU TO NOT BE DETERRED BY WHATEVER -- CONSIDER SMALL CONCERNS YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THROUGH THE PROCESS LAST YEAR. I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THE WASTE DISPOSAL ISSUE IN ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE THREAT OF THE HAZARDOUS NATURE TOXICS ISSUES I THINK THAT SOLVABLE. I'D. THE SENSE I GOT FROM INDUSTRIES THAT THEY REALIZE IT'S A BIG PROBLEM AND IN FACT IT'S A YOU KNOW THERE'S A BLACK MARKET. THE TRAIN IS STATE RIGHT NOW THAT'S HURTING PEOPLE AND THEIR CRIME RINGS GOING ON AT A STATE BACON MILLION DOLLARS SHIPPING THAT AT A STATE. AND THEN BLOWN UP IN OUR BACKYARDS DURING FIRE SEASON I MEAN -- DURING FIREWORKS AND FOURTH OF JULY I MEAN PEOPLE GET HURT PEOPLE GET KILLED SO -- I I I I PROBLEM. BUT I STILL THINK THERE'S HOPE FOR SOLVING THAT SO -- TO EXTEND YOU ARE STILL INTERESTED AYE AYE I THINK IT'S WORTH TAKING ANOTHER BITE AT IT AND YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE CHAIR YOU YOU BRING THAT UP JUST BECAUSE IT'S A REDDING GOING OUTSIDE OF THIS SORT OF UNIVERSE IN POLAND ON GENERAL FUND. THERE IS A WAY TO HAVE A SORT OF SELF CONTAINED ECOSYSTEM I THINK HERE THAT THAT GETS EVERYONE WHAT THEY NEED SO. ANYHOW I WOULD JUST ASK DON'T GIVE UP HOPE IN IF WE CAN TAKE A SHOT AT THIS THING AGAIN. THANK YOU -- ON THE WORKING ON THIS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC OKAY GOOD GOOD I WILL HOLD THAT MATTER OPEN AND WILL ADDRESS IT WILL. LATER LET'S GO TO PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS PROGRAM CONTINUATION ISSUE NUMBER. THIRTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- CAL FIRE IS REQUESTING A TO MAKE PERMANENT ITS PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS PROGRAM -- THAT'S BEEN -- WITH US -- FOR IT WAS ENACTED AFTER THE THE BUDGET ACTIVE OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE REQUEST IS FOR FOURMILLION DOLLARS AND FOURTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS THAT WE CURRENTLY. HAVE FILLED -- TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM INTO THE FUTURE -- THE THE PROGRAM IS -- CONTINUING. TO MOVE THROUGH THE ELEMENTS THAT IT WAS CHARGED WITH. AND IS -- TRULY MOVING INTO THE TRAINING. OF EMPLOYEES ON PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT -- AND PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE OF OF SUPERVISORY AND MANAGEMENT TRAINING. GUIDELINES TO PROMOTE -- THE APPLICATION OF CONSISTENT PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT -- IS SO THAT WE ARE TREATING -- LIKE -- INFRACTIONS OF OUR POLICIES AND RULES -- THE SAME -- FROM ONE END OF THE STATE TO THE OTHER -- AND TO MAINTAIN THAT CONSISTENCY AS WE MOVE THROUGH ANY DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS THAT MIGHT FOLLOW COMMENT. I'LL JUST NOTE THAT IN A WE'RE WE HAVE TO BE VERY STINGY HEARING GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS BECAUSE WE'RE STILL IN THE A. B.. THIRTY TWO OUR ARENA I KNOW THAT WE PASSED SOME EXTENSIONS BUT THAT BEGINS WITH THE OPTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THERE'S A VERY CLOSE NEXUS THAT HAS TO BE SHOWN. ON THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES FOR FUNDS TO TREAT MONEY CENTER USE FROM THE FUND AND THAT'S WELL THE TRAININGS FINE AND THERE'S OTHER. THERE'S OTHER JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET THAT ARE IN THERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OUR OUR DUTY HERE IS TO AS WE SEE FROM THE AUCTION PROCEEDS SO. THIS SHE'S IT'S IT'S IN THERE FOR AT A HUNDRED NOT VERY MUCH. AND FINANCE MAY HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT. SURE SIT IN THE AMOUNT THAT'S INCLUDED IS REFLECTIVE OF SORT OF TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS PROGRAM SUPPORTS THE FIRE PREVENTION PERSONNEL THAT I CAL FIRE. WITHIN SORT OF CAL FIRES RANKS AND SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT AS A PART OF SUPPORTING THAT STAFF THERE WOULD BE A PORTION OF THAT PROGRAM THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL FUNDING MODEL AND THEN. JUST TO THE NEXUS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE MAY TRAIN PEOPLE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES THE CLEANING DOESN'T REDUCE THEM AT I MEAN I KNOW PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET THERE. BUT WE'RE STINGY HERE AS FAR AS SAYING ONCE THEIR TRAIN I GET THAT THEIR THEIR PARTNER THERE. HEY YOU KNOW STAFFING WILL REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. ALL I CAN SAY TO THAT IS IS THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM WITHIN CAL FIRE THAT SUPPORTS ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAMS AND SO FROM THAT SENSE. AND THEN THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT WE WE DO HAVE AND SORT OF THE THE NATURE OF THE BACK STILL OF THE SEA RESPONSIBILITY AREA FIRE PREVENTION FUND SAID THIS. G. G. R. AFFECT NOW ARE YOU GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION BY NOW FORMS A PART OF CAL FIRES BE SLAIN BUDGET AND SAY THIS AMOUNTS OR OR SORT OF STAY RESOURCES THAT ARE PROPOSED HERE CONSISTENT WITH CAL FIRE SPACEPLANE FUNDING MODEL. AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE BACK FILLING IT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED THROUGH THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA FIRE PREVENTION FUNDS WITH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. YOU MAKE MY ARGUMENT FOR THE S. R. A QUESTIONS ON THIS. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS PROGRAM WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT OPEN. I'LL LET'S MOVE TO ITEM FOURTEEN WHICH IS VERY VERY IS CAPITAL OUTLAYS PROGRAMS CENTER MINING DC THE ITEMS WERE WERE WE'RE NOT DOING THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WERE ACTUALLY. PROPOSING TO REMOVE THESE OUTDATED OUR MOVE BEYOND THESE UPDATED -- SELL THESE. THANK YOU FOR THAT LEAD IN CHAIR -- SO THE REQUEST IS -- FOR FORTY JUST OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR FIFTEEN CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS INCLUDING ACQUISITION. PRELIMINARY PLANS A WORKING DRAWINGS -- CONSTRUCTION AND MINOR PRICE. THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IN CAL FIRES FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE -- PLAN -- FOR MULTIPLE YEARS IN SOME CASES -- SOME OF THEM -- OVER THE YEARS HAVE FALLEN OFF OF THE PLAN -- EVEN AFTER HAVING BEEN TO GO THROUGH THEIR PRELIMINARY FINDING A FOUR I MEAN FOR FUNDING FOR PRELIMINARY PLANS. AND SOME OF THE STUDY. FOR THE THOSE -- FACILITIES -- DUE TO THE GENERAL FUND -- REDUCTIONS DURING THE RECESSION -- THAT THAT WAS MOST RECENTLY -- MEAL AT TEN TWELVE YEARS AGO BEHIND US NOW. BUT WHAT I I WANT TO REFLECT IS WHILE THEY ARE SHOWN AS NEW FUNDING. THEY ARE OLD TO THE PLAN. MOST OF THESE PAST AND NOW THEY'RE SHOWING UP AGAIN -- BEFORE YOU. APPROXIMATELY 80% OF CALIFORNIA'S FACILITIES WERE CONSTRUCTED PRE. NINETEEN SEVENTY HAND THE OPERATIONAL LIFE CYCLE OF OF OUR FACILITIES IS IS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS. SO -- WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE REALLY WORKING TO REPLACE -- WHAT WE CAN WHEN WE CAN -- THE OLDER FACILITIES. ARE -- AN ISSUE FOR US -- IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T FIT THE APPARATUS THE FIRE ENGINES AND EQUIPMENT THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY USING -- AND THEN THEY ALSO WERE NOT BUILT. TO A BUILDING CODES THAT WOULD BE EXCEPT OF FURTHER -- THEY ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF TODAY'S MODERN WORKFORCE -- THEY ARE -- VERY MUCH AND IN MANY CASES JUST OPENED BERWICK STYLE -- SLEEPING QUARTERS -- WITH SINGLE SEX BATHROOMS AND AND THE SAME FOR THOSE SLEEPING QUARTERS SO THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE THESE PARTICULAR PROJECTS -- IT FORWARD AND CORRECT SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. AND TO MOVE SOME OF THESE OBSOLETE FACILITIES TO BECOME STORAGE AYE WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE THESE. PODS OF THIS OVER SIMPLIFICATION OF FIVE BUILDINGS AND SOME FROM OR STORED SOME FROM OUR BARRACKS OVER OUR PARKING FACILITIES. FOR THE VEHICLES -- CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME FLAVOR OF WHAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE JUST HOST AND THEY JUST THEY'RE DONE AND IN SOME OF THEM THAT THEY'RE BEING. ARRESTED PER ORDERS REPURPOSED FOR MOVING FROM A FACILITY -- OF SLEEPING FACILITY OR AGAIN I HAVE BROUGHT UP -- MIKE DUGGAN TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I'D SAY WE DEFINITELY LOOK TO REPURPOSE ANYTHING THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY CYCLE -- IS AT A MINIMUM -- FIVE YEARS. TYPICALLY -- SO IF WE CAN REALIZE A STRUCTURE FOR STORAGE -- WE DEFINITELY WILL HAVE YOU CHANGED THE OCCUPANCY OF THE BUILDING THEN YOU HAVE TO BRING IT UP TO CURRENT CODE. AND IN SOME CASES THAT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO QUICKLY SWAP SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE IT WOULD POSSIBLY REQUIRE RE DOING ALL THE ELECTRICAL OR BRINGING IN. FIRE SPRINKLERS -- WHERE WE DON'T HAVE -- ANY WATER TANKS ARE FIRE WATER FLOW. HOW ABOUT THE CCC BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BERRICS THAT MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATED FOR PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS BUT FIRST? HIGH SCHOOL -- YOUNG ADULTS THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATE ON AN INTERIM BASIS AND I'M THINKING ABOUT SOME. FACILITY THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO INCREASE. TWELVE INVENTOR -- THE WEEK CONFERRED THE CONSERVATION CAMP TO A FREE PERSON FACILITY WHICH CAUSED MANY PROBLEMS IN THE SENSE OF THE THE I GUESS THE THEORY. BEHIND THE TWO IS DIFFERENT IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CONFINE PEOPLE AND IN THE FREE PERSON SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT THROUGH WINDOWS. THROUGH DOORS -- CORRIDORS WE HAD THAT WE WE'VE LOOKED -- MANY WAYS TO UTILIZE WHATEVER WE CAN AND IN IN SOME CASES LOOKED OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO UTILIZE THEIR FACILITIES AND AND REPURPOSE THOSE -- THE SEAS I WOULD SAY ARE JUST AS CAN POSSIBLY UTILIZE THINGS I KNOW WHEN -- THE CAMERI -- FACILITY WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE VENTURA CAMP -- WERE WORKING WITH THEM IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE US AND REQUIRE MEMBERS. MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT COMES WITH THE HAVE FREE HEFTY PRICE TAG THERE. CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN US ON I WAS SURPRISED TO TO LEARN HOW MANY OF THE FACILITIES ARE RENTED. AND THAT THERE'S THAT THE RELEASE THAT THE LEASES ARE COMING UP AND THEY'RE OBSOLETE AND NOW THE LANDLORD WHEN SICK. CHECK OUT THE BILL THE CHUCKY CHEESE WHATEVER'S WHATEVER'S GOING ON WHAT. WHAT IS THE WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN GOING FORWARD -- WE ACQUIRING SITES ARE WE LEASING OTHER SITES AND BUILDING UP PEOPLE PEOPLES -- OF REMOTE PROPERTIES. I WOULD SAY ON A THE LARGEST. SCALE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE REALIZE THE TIME AND FISCAL IMPACT ON THE STATE TO PRODUCE THESE FACILITIES. AND PROVIDING THEM ON A SHORT TERM LEASE OF MAYBE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS -- WHERE ONCE WE COME TO THE TABLE AGAIN -- THEY HAVE US OVER A BARREL -- SO WE ARE LOOKING TO ACQUIRE WHAT WE CAN IN PLACES AND THERE'S SOME FACILITIES AND SOME OF THIS CAPITAL PLAN THAT WE HAVE TO LEASE THE FACILITY. ARE WE LEAST LEAST THE GROUND LIKE AT THE AIRPORTS WE CAN'T ON THE PHYSICAL GROUND -- BUT THOSE ARE LONG TERM LEASES PREFERABLY -- THE OTHER LEASES THAT WE DO HAVE OR WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND WE TRY TO GET THE LONGEST TERM POSSIBLE. FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE US FOREST SERVICE AND CONSERVATION CAMPS AND OTHER FIRE STATIONS. AN MY FINAL QUESTION WHAT IS A FIVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR KITCHEN AND TO HIM A COUNTY LOOK LIKE. I WAS LOOKING AT THE EACH EACH E. IN CAMP REPLACEMENT KITCHEN I SAID. TO HIM A COUNTY FIVE AND A HALF MILLION BUCKS FOR KITCHEN. WELL -- ACTUALLY HE WE TRIED -- VERY CREATIVE METHOD IN [inaudible] AND IN IN THAT PROJECT WE HAD A FIRE THAT TOTALED THE KITCHEN AT THE CAMP. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT WE KNEW AT THE FACILITY IN SUSANVILLE CDC ARE HAD JUST PRODUCED THE PLANS. FOR A A KITCHEN THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT ARE NEED WOULD BE -- WE HAD TO MODIFY IT A LITTLE BIT -- JUST AS FAR AS THE COMPONENTS INSIDE BUT PRIMARILY WE WERE TAKING IT AS IS SO WE HAD A RATHER AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO UTILIZE THAT PLAN AND SITE LOCATED. AT TAMA COUNTY -- A A CAMP KITCHEN IT'S DEFINITELY HAVE A LOT OF CODE -- SITUATIONS WITH THAT -- BEING THAT IT'S AN INSTITUTION SO IT HAS TO MEET -- CORRECTIONAL STANDARDS NOT REGULAR COMMERCIAL STANDARDS -- IN. EDUCATE ME MORE ON YOUR MIND. I HAVE I'VE WE'RE LOOKING AT FACILITIES STATIONS -- AND A LOT OF MONEY THAT GOES INTO THE PRELIMINARY PLANS IN THE WORKING DRAWINGS AND IT IT IT. IT SEEMS I DON'T WANNA TO DUMB DOWN THE FACILITIES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE ONE MODEL. THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE WHAT THE CAL FIRE STATION WHO. LOOKS LIKE AND FEELS LIKE IT'S SORT OF THAT SOME ARCHITECTS WOULD SAY HISTORICALLY WHEN YOU WALKED INTO A POST OFFICE YOU HAD THAT FEELING LIKE THIS WAS THE POST OFFICE BUT DIDN'T REDESIGN EVERY POST OFFICE THAT YOU HAD. SO I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL GO TO ONE OF THESE. FIRE STATIONS IN A REMOTE AREA BUT IT SHOULD BE THE DORMITORY SHOULD BE. PRETTY. SIMILAR AT LEAST NINETEEN VERSION OF IT AND I JUST AS I GO THROUGH AND I LOOK AT THIS IS ANOTHER'S DRAWING FOR THIS IS ANOTHER DRIVER THIS IS WORKING DRAWING. I'M READING A BOOK RIGHT NOW BUT AS A MURDER MYSTERY ABOUT DRAWINGS ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS SOME VERY. A TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION THAT. WANT. HELP ME OUT AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE. I THINK YOU'RE GENERALLY SAYING HOW COME WE CAN'T COOKIE CUTTER THESE AND GET THEM OUT FASTER. THAT WOULD BE YET THAT WOULD BE -- YEAH WE DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THAT -- AS FAR AS LIKE TO MACULA WHICH IS A PREVIOUS -- PREVIOUS BUDGET AND ELSINORE -- THOSE SHOULD BE -- VERY SIMILAR IF NOT EXACT AS FAR AS THE STAFFING LEVEL THE CLIMATE LOCATION SO AND STRUCTURALLY AS FAR AS SEISMIC ZONE SO WE WERE LOOKING TO TRY AND UTILIZE THAT AND GET THAT. PROJECT OUT ONE OF THE I WOULD SAY GOALS OR PRODDING SAID WE'VE -- RECEIVED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES EXECUTION WE NEED TO EXECUTE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOT -- SPECIAL DESIGN. EACH INDIVIDUAL PROJECT SO -- I BELIEVE IN THE C. -- ONE THIRTY PROPOSAL OUR ISSUE -- WE'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING THE SAME BARRACKS IN ALL LOCATIONS. SO WE PULLED OUR MOST CURRENT PLAN WHICH IS THE CAR YOU BECAUSE FIRE STATION THAT AS JUST GOING THROUGH PLAN CHECK. IT'S IN A BED BARRACKS WE'RE LOOKING TO UTILIZE THAT INSIGHT ADAPTED TO EACH OF THESE LOCATIONS WHICH IS SHOULD BE. OF QUITE SIMPLE BECAUSE AIRPORTS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY FLAT SO WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SITE WORK THAT WE ASSUME. THE OTHER -- THE ONLY CHANGE THAT WE COULD FOR SEE IS -- HVAC BECAUSE THE CLIMATE BEING -- FAIRLY MINOR SORRY FROM BEING. THAT'S I GET THE CONSTRUCTION BUDGET AND AND AND THOSE THAT PARK BUT THE CULINARY PLANS AND IF IF IT'S AN ACQUISITION I GET THAT THIS DIFFERENT LAN AND DIFFERENT SITES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO I HAVE TO PAY WHAT. BUT THE MARKET RATE AS ELLIE -- DO YOU HAVE A ANYTHING TO ADD. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH AS PACIFIC I'M CAPITAL A PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET BUT JUST WANT TO NOTE FOR YOU. I'M SO OUT OF THE FORTY MILLION FOR CAPITAL A PROJECTS FOR CALIFORNIA. A LITTLE OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF THAT IS TO INITIATE NINE NEW PROJECTS -- AND THAT INCLUDES THREE OF THE BARRACKS PROJECTS RELATED TO THE ISSUE WHEN THIRTY AIR TANKER PROGRAM. SO THOSE IN NINE NEW PROJECTS I'M JUST FOR YOUR OUT YOUR BUDGET PLANNING PURPOSES ARE GONNA HAVE -- TOTAL COSTS OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION TO THAT NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET WOULD BE AND AN% ADDITIONAL CLOSE TO ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR ONE ADDITIONAL BERWICK'S PROJECTS RELATED TO THE C. -- ONE THIRTY PROGRAM AM AND THE ADDITION AROUND. YOU KNOW SO THE THREE THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET ARE RAMONA PASS A RUTHLESS AND FRESNO AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL. ONE CHICO. AND THAT'S NOT IN THIS BUDGET BUT WE CAN IN THE FUTURE YEARS ARE JUST IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT YOUR OUT YOUR COSTS FOR WHAT YOU'RE EXCEPT. ANYTHING TO ADD. NOTHING THAT CENTER STERN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHARGES I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE BRIEFING DOCUMENT I'D. I'M NOT SEEN. THE CONTRACT COUNTIES PIECE OF IT IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S IN A SEPARATE. THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE. I'M SORRY HOURS ARE MY COMMENTS. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN AND MOVED -- TO ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN AND OUR LAST ISSUE THE CONTRACT COUNTY CAPITAL OUTLAY OF THREE POINT THREE MILLION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO THIS IS THE COUNTER CONTRACT BUT COUNTY PIECE -- AND SO CAL FIRES AT IS REQUESTING THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO GENERAL FUND. TO RESTORE THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT -- PROPORTIONAL FUNDING FOR THE SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES OF LA ORANGE -- SANTA BARBARA VENTURE -- KERN AND MARIN COUNTY'S. THE REQUESTED ASKED. FOR THESE FUNDS -- AND OF THE WE'VE USED -- TRADITIONALLY TO BE REINSTATED THIS IS A A NEGOTIATED RATE THAT -- WE'VE COME TO WITH THE A CONTRACT COUNTIES -- IN AGREEMENT WITH AND THAT IS -- APPROXIMATELY IN 19%. OF CALIFORNIA -- IS -- PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR LIKE FOR LIKE DOLLARS SO IT'S 19% OF WHAT WE SPENT LAST YEAR ON ON ON OUR OUR OUR FISCAL I MEAN ON OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY. AND THAT IT WOULD BE EXTENDED. TO THE CONTRACT COUNTIES -- TO A TO DO THE SAME TYPE OF WORK THAT WE'VE DONE. IN THE ENSUING YEAR -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPORTIONAL FUNDING METHOD AND FUNDING MECHANISM THAT WE PUT IN PLACE IS IS. THE WAY TO GO AND IT ALLOWS -- FOR THE FLUCTUATION IN OUR OUR BUDGET AND OUR OUR CYCLE -- TO ME OR WHAT THE CONTRACT CONTRACT COUNTIES -- WOULD GET OUT OF THAT SAME -- FUNDING MECHANISM -- AND NOT END UP WITH IN SOME YEARS AND MUCH LESS IN OTHER YEARS. I GUESS THE STAFF REPORT THIS IS THE SORT OF A GUESSTIMATE ON RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL REIMBURSEMENT THAT THEY'RE GETTING GETTING LA -- DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT YEAH SO AND JUST. TO PROVIDE A LITTLE HISTORY AND THAT THAT THE STATE USED TO PROVIDE FUNDING A CONTRACT COUNTIES FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY AND HAS NOT PROVIDED THAT FUNDING. SENSE -- TWELVE THIRTEEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY PROVIDING. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN I'M AND SO IT YOU KNOW AS YOU'RE WINNING YOUR OVERALL GENERAL FROM PRIORITIES AND MEET YOU KNOW. REINSTATING THIS FUNDING IS REASONABLE CONTRACT COUNTIES ARE PROVIDING A SERVICE TO THE STATE AND CAL FIRE AND THEY OBVIOUSLY NEED. FACILITIES AND FIRE STATIONS TO DO THAT AS TO THE OVERALL CONCEPT IS REASONABLE THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH JUST REINSTATE THE I AM PRIOR FORMULA ON THE FORMULA THEY USE TO FIND THE SUPPORT. AND THAT THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT -- WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT IT THE THE FORMULA THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY SIDE AND NOT COMMENTING ON HOW THE SAME FORMULA IS USED ON THEY JUST GENERAL SUPPORT FOR THE CONTRACT COUNTIES BUT ON THE CAPITAL OUTLAY SIDE? IT'S NOT BASED ON WHAT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY NEEDS ARE. AND AND SO EASY BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY TIED TO THE NEEDS YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THAT FORMULA IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO RINSTATE THE FUNDING TEAM YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO DO THAT -- FOR CONSISTENCY'S SAKE WITH THE WAY WE HOW MUCH MONEY WANT TO GIVING GIVING THEM THAT AMOUNT EVERY YEAR -- WE AND TOOK A LOOK BACK IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROVIDED US THIS INFORMATION IF THAT FORMULA HAD BEEN IN PLACE OVER THE LAST ROUGHLY A DECADE OR SO. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LOWEST YEAR AND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TOTAL TO BE SPLIT AMONGST THE SIX CONTRACT COUNTY SO. KIND OF BASICALLY NOTHING WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THAT BUYS YOU IN TERMS OF CAPITAL OUTLAY. TO NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HIGHEST YEAR. I'M SO IN -- IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE HAVING THAT TYPE OF FLUCTUATION BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO WE NEED TO TO ACTUALLY USE THIS FORMULA BECAUSE IT'S NOT BASED ON WHAT THEIR ACTUAL NEEDS ARE. WE WE KIND OF RECOGNIZE THE BE PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE YOU SAY WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE IT COULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE -- AND IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED QUESTION TO ANSWER AND TO CONTINUALLY UPDATE THE DATA AND SO WE THINK MAYBE JUST PICKING THEM OUT IS IS A SIMPLER APPROACH FOR YOU YOU COULD PICK THE AMOUNT. THE GOVERNOR HAS THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AT THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION THE AVERAGE OF WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS TO BE ABOUT TWO POINT TWO MILLION. THAT WE COULD PICK SOME OTHER AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THEN YOU CAN EVEN SET UP A PROCESS TO REVISIT THE AMOUNT OVER TIME. SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT WERE INCLUDING IN THE CAPITAL OUTLAY OR BUT WE'RE NOT INCLUDING AND WE'RE NOT INCLUDING HELICOPTERS RIGHT WE'RE NOT INCLUDING. THE C. ONE THIRTIES RIGHT WERE OVER WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PHYSICAL WE'RE NOT INCLUDING THE FIRE TRUCKS. TWO I AM TAKING THIS A FUNDING SPECIFICALLY AS RELATED TO THE SORT OF THAT CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURES AND REALLY WHAT THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT IS IS THAT WE FIND THE STATE FIND IN -- SORT OF A PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT -- TO BASED ON SORT OF WHAT THE CONTRACT COUNTIES NEEDS ARE TO PROVIDE EQUIVALENT FIRE PROTECTION. AND SAID THAT -- THAT COMES DOWN TO THE NAY UPSET OF CAL FIRES TOTAL CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURES IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. AND AND IS REALLY TAKING THE CALCULATION ON LIKE FOR LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE TYPE OF FACILITIES THAT THE CONTRACT COUNTIES -- ARE OPERATING -- WHERE IS THERE MAY BE SOME TYPES OF FACILITIES -- THAT ARE IT SORT OF LIKE FOR LIKE WHERE THEY'RE CAL FIRE OPERATED FACILITIES THEY THAT DIRECTOR CAN PROBABLY EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN MYSELF. BUT IF I UNDERSTAND THIS MARIN COUNTY LET'S PICK ON MARIN BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY HERE FROM. FIRE CHIEF IS HERE LET'S PICK LET'S PICK ON MY LIST BECOME RAN LET'S SAY THEY COME THERE'S SPORTY SUPERVISORS DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO UPDATE BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THEIR FACILITIES ARE. AND THEY WANT TO UPDATE ALL THEIR FIRE FACILITIES. WE WOULD. DO WE WOULD. THE CALIFORNIA TO HAVE TO ACTIVATE THE CITY TAKE THE ACTION WE WOULD PAY FOR THE PORTION OF THE FACILITY COSTS THAT WOULD -- THAT THEY WE USE FOR KALIFORNIA ASSISTANCE IN THE AREA. NO NOT NOT STRUCTURED NOT BASED ON HOW THE METHODOLOGY METHODOLOGY IS STRUCTURED SO IN YOUR IN THE CASE OF YOUR EXAMPLE MARIN COUNTY WOULD TAKE THE ACTIONS TO UPDATE THEIR FACILITIES AND THEN A FEW YEARS OUT FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO THE METHODOLOGY BASED ON WHAT TELL FIRE. SPENDS ON ITS CAPITAL PROGRAM. HI. I THINK AS THE ELLIE -- IS HAS RECOGNIZED SORT OF THE NEEDS AT THE LCAL LEVEL ARE ARE FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL BEYOND JUST THE FACILITIES THAT SORT OF SIR PROVIDE THAT CONTRACT COUNTY SERVICE. TO WEAR BUT BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO MEET THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT WHICH IS AND AND SO THIS IS THE WAY THAT'S BEEN. UTILIZED OVER TIME THE METHODOLOGY THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD AND WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONCERNS -- BY THE CONTRACT COUNTIES WITH THIS METHODOLOGY I WOULD ALSO NOTE YOU KNOW THERE'S VERY ABILITY IN OUR STATE CAPITOL PROGRAM IN TERMS OF WHAT WE FIND FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS AND THIS METHODOLOGY IS CAN IS CONSISTENT -- YOU KNOW WITH THAT METHODOLOGY OUR TRACKS WITH THAT METHODOLOGY. WITH OR THAT VERY ABILITY RATHER I'M GONNA OPEN THE PUBLIC FINAL THOUGHTS YEAH I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT I AM. WHAT WHILE WHAT'S PROPOSED HERE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY METHODOLOGY THAT'S BEEN USED AND THERE IS A STATUTE AND THERE IS A? GENERAL OPINION ABOUT. I'M BASING IT ON HOW MUCH THE STATE SPENDS I'M THE STATE OBVIOUSLY IS NOT NECESSARILY BOUND TO TO THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PROVIDING THIS FUNDING. SO IF YOU WERE BOUND TO THAT THEN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THE SPENDING AT THAT THE SAME FORMULA OUT OVER ALL THESE YEARS AND THIS WOULD NOT BE A QUESTION FOR YOU TODAY -- AND SO YOU KNOW WE DO THINK THAT YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IS CERTAINLY REINSTATING THE OLD FORMULA IS ONE WAY TO DO IT BUT IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS SINCE YOU PROVIDED THIS FUNDING AND IT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK -- AND IN YOUR EXAMPLE WHERE THAT FIRE STATION IN MARIN AND THAT WOULD BE BASED ON THE ACTUAL NEEDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS IS BASED ON WHAT CAL FIRE SPENDING ON ITS FACILITIES AND SAYING WILL BECAUSE WE BILL YOU KNOW WE HAVE THOSE NINE NEWS STATIONS OR WHATEVER. THAT THAT'S GOING TO TRANSLATE INTO THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SO IT'S REALLY NOT TIED TO THE MEANS AND SELL EITHER WE THINK YOU JUST HAVE OPTIONS IT'S SORT OF A GOOD NEIGHBOR. APPROACH TO THESE FOLKS THAT ARE PROVIDING THESE THAT THE SERVICES AND IN THIS AREA. OKAY -- IF MY COLLEAGUES OR HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NO GO AHEAD ASK AS YOUR QUESTION -- CENTER STERN. THINK. OF SO. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN FOR THE QUESTION -- SO WITH THE CONTRACT COUNTIES ACTUALLY HAVE STE THE FACILITIES THAT -- IN MANY CASES WAR STATE FACILITIES BEFORE THEY BECAME A CONTRACT COUNTY. AND SO THOSE ARE THE SAME FACILITIES WERE TALKING ABOUT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED THE GREAT BOOK WE TRACK ALL OF THE FACILITIES THAT ARE -- THAT RE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS TYPE OF FUNDING AND ALL OF THE ENGINES AND AND OTHER EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL. UNDER A GREAT BOOK SO THE GREYBULL THESE ARE THE ONES THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. FOR FOR USE OF THIS MONEY -- HOWEVER. THAT IS NOT HOW WE'RE WE'RE ASSESSING THEIR NEEDS THE THAN THAT NEEDS ARE NOT PART OF THIS DISCUSSION AS MUCH AS IT'S A PROPORTIONAL -- AMOUNT OF WHAT CAL FIRE IS GETTING TO TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURES AND THE FACILITIES THAT ARE LIKE FOR LIKE IN THOSE GRAY BOOK OR THOSE CONTRACT COUNTY LOCATIONS SO. IF I HAVE A FIRE STATION A CALIFORNIA FIRE STATION AND I'M GONNA. I'M GONNA REBUILD IT THAT A PORTION OF THAT FUNDING WE'RE ANTICIPATING THE CURRENT CONTRACT COUNTIES ALSO NEED TO DO. TO MAINTAIN THE BUILDINGS THAT WE LEFT THEM WITH. WHAT IS THIS GUY? IS THERE A AT THE BAR THEY ASK DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF NEED OUT THERE HAVE YOU HEARD FROM. ANY OF THESE COUNTIES ABOUT SORT OF WHAT THE OVERALL SENSES -- THE OVERALL SCOPE I MEAN I'M A YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT IT WHAT WHAT WE LOOKING AND FOURTEEN IT'S THREE POINT THREE MILLION HERE BUT FOR THE THE VARIOUS CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. FOR WORD FORTY MILLION OBVIOUS IT NEEDS IN A BE FAR GREATER AND THERE'S A LOT OF CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- THERE TOO BUT JUST GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT SIMILARLY THESE THESE FACILITIES ARE IN SIMILAR -- AGE CATEGORIES -- AS THEY ARE ACROSS THE STATE IN IN GREAT BOOK VERSUS OUR BLUE BOOK -- AND THE THOSE ARE THE LIKE FOR LIKE -- STATIONS. AND FACILITIES -- SO THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN THE SAME STATE -- IT DAILY IN SOME CASES COUNTIES HAVE SUBSIDIZED THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON STATIONS AND BROUGHT STATIONS -- UP TO A CODE OR THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THAT HAS GROWN UP AROUND THEM. AND SO -- IN SOME CASES THIS THIS MONEY -- WOULD LIKELY BE BACK FILL FOR SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY DONE TO SOME OF THE THE GREAT BOOKS STATIONS. I WOULD JUST REITERATE THE POINT I MADE EARLIER AND TO THE EXTENT. WHEN WE HAVE? THESE FACILITIES GO DOWN DURING AN INCIDENT BECAUSE OF LACK OF ABILITY MAINTAIN HAVE AN ADEQUATE ELECTRICAL BACKUP POWER RESILIENT SYSTEMS OR WHATEVER ELSE GOING TO SPENDING IS CAPITAL -- ON YET WE WANT TO HELP YOU BECAUSE IT'S WHEN WHEN RESIDENCY. THEIR ACTUAL FIRE STATION SHUT. YEAH THIS HAPPENED A NUMBER TIMES DURING THESE PAST FEW INCIDENTS AND IT'S IT'S DISTURBING AND IT'S SOMETHING I THINK IT'S SOLVABLE BUT I YEAH WE'LL WE'LL WAIT TILL HE IF WE HEAR FROM ANY COUNTIES BUT I'M HAPPY. TO HELP YOU GUYS WORK THROUGH SOME OF THAT BECAUSE YET WHEN YOU JOIN YOUR FEET WHEN. THINGS HIT THE FAN. OKAY THANK YOU. THERE YOU ARE NOW I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING PORTION OF THIS MATTER ARE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION THIS WILL BE. ISSUES. WE GET IT RIGHT.

WHEN IT DEPARTMENT DOES A PLAN LIKE THAT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THEIR AGENCY IT HAS TO GO THROUGH FINANCE IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE GOVERNOR? SO THAT PLAN MIGHT NOT LOOK.
