TO OPINE ON THIS. I'D THAT THAT

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.400
WAS A SUGGESTION THAT WAS MADE

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:12.202
THE STAFF REPORT I JUST FELT

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:14.104
LIKE THAT MADE SENSE AND I THINK

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:15.472
THERE WAS. THERE WAS CERTAINLY

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:17.508
NO OPPOSITION TO DOING THAT

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:19.610
WOULD ULTIMATELY AT THE END. OF

00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:21.311
HOPEFULLY RESULT IN A BETTER

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:22.946
PRODUCT BUT IF THEY'VE GOT

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.314

I'D BE HAPPY HERE ABSOLUTELY I

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:27.651
BELIEVE THE- CALIFORNIA

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:29.286
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WILL

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:31.421
ALSO BE A WEIGHING IN ON THIS AS

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:33.390

LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE. YEAH

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:39.329
SO THE WAY THAT THE BILL

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:39.997
STRUCTURE THE PRIORITIZATION AT

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:41.632
THIS POINT IS THAT- REQUIRES

00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:44.001
THAT THE CTC AT. DIRECT

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:46.270
RESOURCES TO PROJECT RESOURCES

00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:47.337
TO THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:48.472
MOST HIGH PRIORITY VULNERABLE

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.140
ASSETS. AND IN MAKING THAT

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:51.241
DETERMINATION IT DIRECTS THE

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.177
COMMISSION TO CONSIDER. THE

00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:54.645
DEGREE OF RISK FOR RECURRING

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.180
DAMAGE- ASSET FAILURE DUE TO

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.081
CLIMATE THREATS. ON IT

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.650
SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES THAT FOR

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:00.484
PROJECTS ON THE STATE HIGHWAY

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:01.818
SYSTEM THE COMMISSION SHALL

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:03.387
CONSULT THE DEPARTMENT REALLY

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:05.289
ROBUST ADAPTATION PRIORITIZATION

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.790
WORK. AND THERE'S ALREADY BEEN

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:09.493
UNDERTAKEN. AND THEN- SO THE

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.128
SECOND PRIORITIZATION COMPONENT

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:12.763
IS THAT. THEY CONSIDER THE

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:14.198
BENEFITS OF THE PROJECTS TO

00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:15.866

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:20.437
BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.039
PROTECTING THE ASSETS. AND THEN

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:23.740
THIRDLY IT DIRECTS AT

00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:25.809
PRIVATIZATION FOR PROJECTS THAT.

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:28.212
BENEFIT PURPOSE SORRY BENEFITS

PRESERVING OR PROTECTING

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:31.748
ADJACENT COMMUNITIES AND THE

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.250
ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER CRITICAL

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.352
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT'S THAT

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:36.620
YOU DON'T HAVE TIER ONE

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:38.722
PRIORITIZATION. AND THEN YOU

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:41.191
KNOW IN ADDITION IT. REQUIRES

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:43.193
THE CDC TO GIVE EXTRA CREDIT IF

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:46.997
ALSO HELP ADVANCE OTHER STATE.

VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:04.314
IN THE VICINITY OF THE PROJECT.

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:06.149
MAN CHARGED I WAS JUST THAT I

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.417
COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR YOU

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:08.318
KNOW THE- THE LEGISLATURE HAS A

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:10.287
RICH HISTORY OF HUNTING

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:12.456
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE AIRPORT-

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:14.424
PUNTING RESPONSIBILITY THAT PVC

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:16.226
OR PUNTING RESPONSIBILITY THAT.

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:17.594
THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO SORT OF

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:19.563
COME UP WITH THAT AND WE'VE BEEN

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.132
CRITICIZED OF NOT GIVING ANOTHER

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:25.636
DIRECTION AND- WE HAVE. WE HAVE

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:27.604
CLIMATE. GOALS THAT WE WANT TO

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.406
MAKE THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:31.508
AND THEN IF A PIECE OF THAT IS

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.644
THE HIGHWAY THAT THE ROADS AND

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.479
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:38.081
RIGHT HAND LEFT HAND TALKING

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.283
BECAUSE- SOME OF THOSE. I'M

00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:40.751
SUGGESTING THAT SOMETIMES WE

00:48:40.817 --> 00:48:42.419
MIGHT HAVE TO ABANDON THE ROADS

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:44.388

ADAPTATION PROJECT FOR SEA LEVEL

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:51.094
RISE- FOR FLOODING THAT THE

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:53.230
CALTRANS NCTC HAS SORT OF BEEN

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:55.799

THE ROADS OPEN SO JUST THIS IS

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:00.370
THIS IS AN INVITATION WITH THE

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:02.539
BILL TO DO. A DEEPER DIVE ON

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:04.775
THOSE THINGS AND THEN THEY MAKE

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.743
SURE THAT AT LEAST WE CREATE A

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.145
RECORD HERE THAT CTC AFTER

00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:11.715

AND EVERY ROSE TO THE FLAME

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:16.720
DOESN'T MAKE IT SOMETIMES IT MAY

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.021

PENALTY. BASICALLY COULD BE. A

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.955

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.556
CLARIFIES THAT THE FOR NOTICE OF

VIOLATION WILL CARRY NO PENALTY

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:43.625
AND WHEN WILL INSTEAD BE

SUBSEQUENT WILL BE A- AN

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.500
ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATION IF THAT

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.975
MOSTLY TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:01.543
WITHIN THAT CITY THAT-

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:02.978
ADMINISTER TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:04.846
WHICH COULD BE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.281
AND AT THAT POINT IT COULD BE

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:09.785
AT- A CITATION WITH THAT WITHIN

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:10.886
THAT DEPARTMENT SO THAT SHOULD

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:14.523
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARER- ON

INDUSTRY ITSELF- IS THERE'S NO

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.921
YOU KNOW WHATEVER WASTE HAULING

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:03.691
COMPANY- IS LEASING THE TRASH

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:06.260
RECEPTACLES AND THEY DON'T HAVE

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:07.829
THOSE REFLECTIVE MARKINGS. THEN

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.297
WHO COLLECTS THE O. LINE FROM

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:11.065
THEM IT WOULD BE THE CITY IN

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.000
QUESTION AND THIS IS ALL YOU

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:17.171
WOULD. KEEP THAT MONEY THE CITY.

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.407
THE CITY WOULD BE IN CHARGE AIR

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:20.308
FORCE A AND THE FOLLOWING ARE

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:22.210
VERY MINIMAL THE MONEY WITH ITS

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:23.244
MORE OF A PUBLIC SAFETY

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.111
KNOWLEDGE AND- BECAUSE THE

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:25.847
FINDER. THE VERY FIRST OFFENSE

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:28.950
IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS- SECOND IS

01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:29.717
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:32.153
THIRD IS A THOUSAND RIGHT I JUST

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.387
I DIDN'T SEE IN THE BILL I

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:35.857
NOTICED WHERE YOU PULLED OUT THE

01:31:35.923 --> 01:31:37.859
PART. THAT REFERENCE ON THE

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:39.493
STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.761
AND SO I DIDN'T SEE IN THERE

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:42.563
THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE CITY.

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.665
IS THE ENTITY THAT WOULD COLLECT

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:46.701
THAT REVENUE IN KEEP IT AND WE

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:48.336
WILL WORK WITH THAT TO CLARIFY

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:51.205
THAT. BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST TO GET

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:53.274
THE PROGRAM MOVING AND I THINK

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:56.010
THAT- WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:56.911
PUNITIVE TO THE INDUSTRY WE'RE

01:31:56.978 --> 01:31:59.380
JUST TRYING TO BRING THEM AROUND

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:01.148
. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:03.084
SO MANY CITIES OF AVAST FOR

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:07.088
INDIA BY TO LISTEN. AND DRIVERS

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:08.923
AT NIGHT IN RURAL AREAS

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.691
ESPECIALLY. BE VERY DANGEROUS.

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:11.659
AND I BELIEVE SENATOR ARCHER

01:32:11.726 --> 01:32:13.594
LETTER THAT WAS TAKEN OUT FROM

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:14.829
THE BILL SO IT'S NOT- THERE'S

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:20.134
NO- CLEARER- DEFINITION ON WHO

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:21.869
WOULD ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE-

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:24.272
VIOLATION OR- WAS RECEIVED THAT.

01:32:24.338 --> 01:32:25.873
ARE WHO WOULD ENFORCE AND

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.742
RECEIVE THE REVENUE ON ON THE-

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:29.777
VIOLATION. SO THAT COULD BE-

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:31.512
DISCUSSED MOVING FORWARD IN THIS

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:34.081
BILL AND I THINK THIS IS. NEXT

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:35.182
GOING TO JUDICIARY SENATE

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:36.417
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S VOTE COULD

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.986
BE TAKEN UP AT THAT POINT- THANK

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.354
YOU SENATOR MELENDEZ AND SENATOR

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:41.923

OR COMMENTS. SENATOR BATES ARE

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:46.260
YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR SENATOR

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:48.362
ARCHULETA MY UNDERSTANDING IS-

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:50.197
LET MANY CITIES HAVE FRANCHISE

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:52.233
AGREEMENTS WITH WASTE HAULERS.

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.401
WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING THAT

01:32:53.467 --> 01:32:56.737
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO- REQUIRE-

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:59.607
WIND THEY NEGOTIATE THEIR THEIR-

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:00.808
THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH CITIES

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.510
THAT THESE PARTICULAR.

01:33:02.576 --> 01:33:05.012
REFLECTIVE TAPES WHATEVER THE

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.814
USE FOR THE REFLECTIVE DEVICE BE

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:09.984
INCLUDED. ON THEIR LARGE.

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:10.985
DUMPSTERS OF THE LARGE

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:13.521
CONTAINERS- THAT WAY THERE WOULD

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:16.657
BE A WAY TO- ACTUALLY FOLLOW UP

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:18.926
ON WHO DID IT. IT IT IT DID NOT

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:21.028
DO IT. AND WHERE THE- PENALTIES

01:33:21.095 --> 01:33:22.596
LION AND THAT COULD REALLY BE

01:33:22.663 --> 01:33:24.432
VERY FOCUSED AT A LOCAL

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:25.633
GOVERNMENT LEVEL AND I THINK

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.468
EASILY TRACKED DOWN THAT IF THE

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:32.039
QUESTION. WAS PERHAPS THE

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:33.307
SUGGESTION. YES I THAT EVERY

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:35.176
THAT WE'RE A TO DO- WILL COME

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:37.078
FORWARD WORKING WITH THE TRASH

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:40.715
INDUSTRY MAKING SURE THAT- THAT

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:42.783
WHATEVER. OWNERSHIP OBVIOUSLY

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.051
YOU KNOW EVERY CITY HAS A

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:46.887
DIFFERENT COMPANY. AND FROM THE

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:48.656
INVESTIGATIVE WORK WE'VE DONE

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:50.124
THEY'RE ALL READY TO DO IT THEY

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:52.793
JUST WANT TO. HEAR FROM US THAT-

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:54.328
THE COMPULSION ARE PARTICIPATING

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:55.997
IN A MENTORED EARLIER A FEW OF

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.665
THEM ARE DOING IT. WE JUST GOT

01:33:57.732 --> 01:33:59.400
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK HAND

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.168
IN HAND WITH THE CITY AND IT

01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:03.571
COULD BE A CITY SEAL COULD BE

01:34:03.637 --> 01:34:05.306
THE WRAPPING. BUT REFLECTIVE

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.141
THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY WILL

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:08.876
BE SEEN AS THE AUTOMOBILE THE

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:11.779
BICYCLIST APPROACHES. THAT'S

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:17.685
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. I'M NOT

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:19.854
I'M GOING TO JUST A NOTE BOOK

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.422
THIS MORNING THAT WORK WITH YOU

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:23.324
ON A FEW IDEAS I FEEL IT'S A

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:25.126
LITTLE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE. I

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:26.660
THINK THAT WILL HELP THEN IT

01:34:26.727 --> 01:34:28.662
WILL ALSO HELP R. I THINK IN FOR
