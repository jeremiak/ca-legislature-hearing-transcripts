WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE I AM WAITING FOR ONE MORE COMMITTEE MEMBER IN ORDER TO. START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE SO I BEG YOUR INDULGENCE IT'S THEM ONE OF THOSE REALLY BUSY DAYS AND. I'M NOT TRYING TO GET ONE MORE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO. I WILL START SOON SO IT LOOKS LIKE. THEY LOOKS LIKE WE'RE READY TO START IS A SUBCOMMITTEE. WELCOME TO. VICE CHAIRMAN MADE. MATHIS. HE. SO I'M WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TODAY IS WE HAVE NINE BILLS ON THE AGENDA. AND THE BELLS ARE HEARD IN FILE ORDER I WOULD LIKE TO ASK EACH OF THE AUTHOR TO HAVE BEEN NO MORE THAN THREE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE TABLE. AND THE OP OF THE OPPOSITION IS WELL IN EACH WITNESS WILL BE GIVEN TWO MINUTES. AND THENAFTER THAT IF YOU COULD IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND. IN YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL SO WILL START. WITH MISTER BIGELOW NUMBER THREE ON THE AGENDA AB TWENTY ONE FOURTEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT ACTUALLY MANAGER WITH A LITTLE LEVITY FOR THE DAY BECAUSE IT'S AN AFTERNOON. A FRIEND OF MINE ASKED ME TO START OFF LIKE THIS. MY FELLOW MEMBERS. I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BAIL TO WANT ONE FOR. AND THAT'S ALL I AGREED TO DO. IT CAN BE FUNNY AT TIMES SO LITTLE LEVITY IS GOOD. ANYWAY THIS MEASURE IS A SPONSORED A MEASURE BY THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION. AND I PROVIDE SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE FOOD AND AG CODE. AB TWENTY ONE FOURTEEN WILL EXPAND THE LIMITED EXEMPTION TO ALLOW A MOBILE PROCESS OPERATOR TO HARVEST IT. A PURCHASED ANIMAL FOR THE CONSUMER ON THE LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS PROPERTY. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL INCLUDES AN INDUSTRY SUPPORTED FEE INCREASE FOR BRAIN INSPECTORS TO RECOVER COSTS. AND FINALLY AB TWENTY ONE FOURTEEN WILL ALLOW THE CDF A. TO ACCEPT ANNUAL PERMIT TO REENTER THE STATE. CURRENTLY THE PRODUCERS HAVE TO FIND A BRAND INSPECTOR FROM ANOTHER STATE TO CONDUCT AN INSPECTION PRIOR TO RE ENTRY. THIS CAN BE BURDENSOME AND SOMETIMES EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS JUST AN ALL FILLED WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. IT WITH YOUR INDULGENCE WOULD WE ALLOW HIM TO SPEAK. THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST NOT FEEL OF CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION I WILL MAKE THIS BRIEF. KNOWING YOU HAVE OTHER ITEMS ON THE AGENDA JUST A COUPLE POINTS I WANT TO MAKE. IN ADDITION TO. SOME OF EMBRYOS COMMENTS ON THE. INSPECTION FOR MOBILE SLOUGHED SLAUGHTER OPERATOR I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. THE ANIMAL THAT'S HARVESTED ON THE PROPERTY ULTIMATELY HAS TO STILL GO TO A STATE LICENSE FOR USDA INSPECTED FACILITY TO BE PROCESSED. AND ALSO. THE MEAT CAN ONLY BE CONSUMED BY THE BUYER. COULD NOT BE SOLD AT RETAIL. OR BE SOLD YOU KNOW ANY OTHER WAY. AND THEN ON THE FEE IT IS AN INDUSTRY SUPPORT FEE I IT IT DOES SEEK TO. HELP. THE PUREFLEX LIKE ID RECOVER SOME COSTS. WHEN INSPECTING SMALLER LOTS OF CATTLE SO ESSENTIALLY. THEY'LL BE HIGHER FEE ON YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO HAD THAT MIGHT BE INSPECTED AND AND A SMALLER FEE. ON ON A HUNDRED CATTLE THAT ARE INSPECTED IT STILL COST THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE BUREAU INSPECTOR TO GO OUT TO THAT FACILITY. AND SO BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NOW WE DO SUPPORT WE HAVE A RESOLUTION ON THE BOOKS TO. TO SUPPORT THAT SO ANYWAYS I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THINK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEING NO MOVEMENT IS THERE ANYONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. NO OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS. MR MATHIS. MISTER BIGELOW ODD CAN ALSO SPEAK WITH GOOD ACTION LOT THAT. LATE WITH THAT AT ALL SO IF WE HAD A. QUORUM HERE I'D* MOVE THE BILL. BUT I WILL ASK TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR GOODS. AND DO THAT. VERY GOOD. HOPEFULLY THAT ENDS OUR OUR ATTEMPTS TO BE. VERY RURAL TODAY AB YOU MAY KEEP YOU MAKE THAT YOU MAY CONCLUDE AT YEAH THIS BILL DOES. ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WE GET AT A QUORUM OBVIOUSLY WILL. I MADE MY COMMITMENTS AND AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND ASKED THE MEMBERS FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MR ARAMBULA. YOU ARE AT. I AM NUMBER FIVE ON THE AGENDA WITCHES AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY EIGHT. WHICH IS A BILL THAT WOULD MAKE IT UNLAWFUL. TO MAINTAIN AN APIARY THAT IS NOT REGISTERED AND WOULD CHANGE THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS TO THE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER. CURRENTLY ANY PERSON RELOCATING A COLONY OF BEES FOR ARE REGISTERED APIARY AND ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER COUNTY SHALL NOTIFY THE DESTINATION COUNTY AG COMMISSIONER WITHIN FIVE DAYS. THIS NOTIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE THE COMMISSIONER WITH AN ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE BEES TO USE AS A DETERMINING FACTOR. WHEN ISSUING USE PERMITS FOR PESTICIDE APPLICATION. THAT PERMIT CONDITIONS WILL TYPICALLY INCLUDE DATE TIME AND SPECIAL CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE COMMISSIONER THAT MUST BE ADHERED TO. BY A CERTIFIED APPLICATOR. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY EIGHT WILL IMPROVE INFORMATION BY ENSURING THE COMMISSIONER HAS THE MOST UPDATED INFORMATION. APPROVED IT IN A PESTICIDE USE PERMIT OF A PESTICIDE HARMFUL DEBBIE'S NEAR AN APIARY CAN BE AVOIDED. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE COMMISSIONERS WITH CIVIL PENALTY AUTHORITY TO ASSIST WITH INCREASING COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS TO REGISTER WITH THE COUNTY AG COMMISSIONER. WHEN THE TRANSPORTING APIARY COLONY INTO THE COUNTY. CIVIL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES ARE A COMMON TOOL ALREADY USED BY COUNTY AG COMMISSIONERS. THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK ALLOWS FOR THE APPEALS PROCESS BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE PRIOR TO THE PENALTY BEING IMPOSED. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REDUCE THE TIME TO REGISTER FROM FIVE DAYS TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS. IN AN ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND ACCURACY OF LOCATION INFORMATION. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MATT SO SILVERLINK FROM THE CALIFORNIA AG COMMISSIONERS. BECAUSE WELL AS RICK THE RULE OUT THE TEHAMA COUNTY AG COMMISSIONER. RIVER. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONS ASSOCIATION MY NAME IS RICK COROLLA TEHAMA COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER. SO WHAT I'M HERE TODAY IS TO ASK SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THAT WILL ALLOW CALTRAIN AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO BETTER TO BE ABLE TO BETTER DO OUR OUR JOB TO PROTECT BEEKEEPERS. LAST FISCAL YEAR. STATEWIDE. WE EXPANDED FROM OUR COUNTY NET NET GENERAL FUND SO ONE MILLION FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWELVE DOLLARS. ENFORCING BE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS WELL AS. LOCAL ORDINANCES. AND. WILLIE BROWN AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN DOLLARS. WITH WITH THE ONSET OF INCREASED TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES ALLOWING US TO ELECTRONICALLY MAP BEES WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER PROTECT THE BEES AND AND UP PREVENT BE LOSSES IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITHIN ANDERSON WITH CAPTAIN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A PEST CONTROL ADVISERS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PICASSO OVER THE LAST YEAR. ON A PROJECT CALLED BE WHERE. AS RICK WAS MENTIONING THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE AND. AND COMMUNICATE BETTER IN THE FIELD BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS THAT PCA'S WHICH WE REPRESENT THE APPLICATORS THE COMMISSIONERS AND BEEKEEPERS I'M SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A. MORE ROBUST SYSTEM TO PROTECT. OUR POLLINATORS ESPECIALLY AROUND ALMOND BLOOM THANK YOU. THINK YOU'RE MUCH. HOLLY FOR MANY WITH LIGHT HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIPHATE CALIFORNIA STATE BEEKEEPERS ASSOCIATION WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BALLOT OR WORKING WITH. LEG AB COMMISSIONERS ON AND FORCE THE MECHANISMS IN LANGUAGE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. IF YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW CYBERLINK BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER SINCE YOUR DISSOCIATION AND OUGHT TO BE REPETITIVE ESTO. WHAT MR GROW RD TESTIFIED TO YOU BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE TO PUT IN A REGULATORY SCHEME TO ENFORCE A SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY UNDER CURRENT LAW TO REGISTER THE AYE COMMISSIONER ME COMING IN THE COUNTY YOU BUSINESS IS A COMMERCIAL? PAPER I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS. PRESENCE OF A CIVIL PENALTY WOULD INCREASE THAT COMPLIANCE RATE HELP US UNDERSTAND WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE. AND WHETHER DOING THEIR WORK SO WE CAN KEEP THEM SAFE AND. PROTECT BEAST WHICH WILL WANT TO. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GEORGE SOURIS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL AIRCRAFT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD THING NO OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. GALLAGHER. HE HAD JUST VERY BRIEFLY MADAM CHAIR OWES DISCUSS IS ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE. COMMISSIONER GROW UP FOR MY DISTRICT. AND. YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A. A GOOD BILL AND NECESSARY MOVE FORWARD ALSO YOU KNOW. ARE I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IN OUR OUR. BEEKEEPING INDUSTRY A VERY IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. AS AS MANY WILL TELL YOU AND SO I THINK THIS IS ALL PART AND PARCEL OF THAT AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD ANYONE ELSE. I JUST HAVE A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE M. MISUMI THAT AT SOME POINT IT BECOMES. A LITTLE BIT EASIER IF THERE'S AN APP THAT'S CREATED WHERE YOU CAN JUST TARGET WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED IS THAT. IT YEAH I ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS IN RIGA CARDS TO BROADBAND. A IT IS THEIR WORK HAPPENING TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER. I GUESS IN MY MY PITCHES I ALWAYS HATE TO. TO BE PUTTING A BURDEN ON AN INDUSTRY THAT. THAT IS A SMALL BUSINESS BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS REALLY TO PROTECT THAT INDUSTRY. AND SO THAT IS KIND OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN. TELLING THEM YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND THEN ALSO MAKING IT EASY FOR THEM TO DO IT. SO I THINK REGISTRATION OBVIOUSLY IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE RIGHT THERE IN THE AG COMMISSIONERS DEPARTMENT BUT. CAP IS BEEN WORKING WITH INDUSTRY. TO INTEGRATE INTO SOME OF THE FIELD TOWARDS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING UTILIZED FOR PCA'S APPLICATORS AND WE BE AND ABLE TO INTEGRATE THE BEE KEEPER INTERFACE INTO THAT AS WELL. AND IT FLOWS INTO GALLON PERMITS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATIONS. VERY GOOD. AND AND I COULD OUT ON THAT WE HAVE A VERY ANTIQUATED SYSTEM WHEREBY AG COMMISSIONER'S STAFFERS AT LITTLE USING A PEN ON A CORK BOARD NOT TO MAP THESE BEES. WITH A WITH A RECENT. ENACTMENT OF THE REGULATION OF FOR PRESS AYE NOTIFICATION AROUND SCHOOLS WE HAVE A. NEW ELECTRONIC MAPPING SYSTEM TO ALLOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO PIGGYBACK ON THAT SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO ACT REALLY MAPPER BEE HIVES AND WE DEDICATED. CALIFORNIA COMMISSIONS ASSOCIATION HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO WORK WITH OUR SOFTWARE VENDOR TO TO FURTHER THAT ENDEAVOR THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GOOD I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT AND I'M ENTITIES ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION THAT WAS ACTUALLY AT THE ASSOCIATION'S CONCERN AS WELL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOFTWARE AND MAKING IT JUST EASIER. SPECIAL ARE MOVING FROM ONE COUNTY TO THE OTHER IF WE COULD JUST DO IT SIMPLY ON AN OUTFIT ON AN IPHONE RATHER THAN HAVING TO. FAX THINGS AND THE OLD METHOD THAT WAS WHY THEY WERE I'M VERY OPEN TO SUPPORTING THIS BELT BECAUSE THIS OFFER SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE REALLY RIGHT ON THE HORIZON. GREAT. YOU CAN SAY SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS OF FEAR NOT A GREAT WAY TO GIVE THE COMMISSIONERS ARE VERY SOME MORE TOOLS TO LOBBY SAFE. YOU MAKE INCLUDE. WELL IF I CAN BE SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT ONE UC I THANK YOU FOR BE LEAVING AND. SPELL AND HUMBLY REQUEST YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE IT WHEN WE GET A QUORUM WILL. TAKE THIS SEPARATED DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. SO. I'M LOOKING AROUND I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER AUTHORS AM I CAN PROCESS AND ON BEHALF OF. MISTER RODRIGUEZ TO KEEP US MOVING HERE. SALT ALTERNATES OVER. YOU. HE LIKES TO THE AFTERNOON MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY WILL HELP FACILITATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FOOD BANKS. BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES FOR SUCH PARTNERSHIPS. THESE GUIDELINES WOULD CONSIST OF INFORMATION ON FOOD HANDLING REGULATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS ON FOOD AND COST CONTROL AND AN EXAMPLE OF WRITTEN PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. FOOD BANKS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIGHT CHILD FOOD INSECURITY. BY PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND INFORMATION AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY WILL TAKE US ONE STEP CLOSER TO ENDING HAD A HUNGER IN CALIFORNIA. THANKFULLY AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR. GOOD AFTERNOON TAYLOR RUSSIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT WE ARE SUPPORTED IN CONCEPT. OUR GROWERS RECOGNIZE THAT LIABILITY CAN BE A HUGE DETERRENT FOR MAKING DONATIONS TO FOOD BANKS AND SCHOOLS. AND AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT BETTER EDUCATION OF BOTH PARTIES WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER CONSUMPTION OF CALIFORNIA BASED PRODUCTS AND CREATE LIFELONG LEADERS THINKS. THANKS LADY BIRD REPRESENTING AMERICAN KENNY PEDIATRICS'S WELL SCHOOL NURSES WERE IN SUPPORT. MILLION. ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. PLEASE LET THE OTHER KNOW I I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC BILL. WE DO A LOT OF THIS IN MY LOCAL AREA. INTO PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE FOOD BANKS IN THE SCHOOL SO I'M I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS FORWARD IN. ONE SIDE WE HAVE A QUORUM MADAM CHAIR WE WILL MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU FUNDS GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I SEE WE HAVE ANOTHER AUTHOR HERE MISTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL AB TWENTY NINE OH NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. IT'S AN HONOR TO PRE HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE ON I KNOW NINE A FIRST ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR BEING SO HELPFUL. ARE MUCH APPRECIATED. IN THE WAKE OF CALIFORNIA'S FARM TO FORK MOVEMENT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR LOCAL AND SMALL FARM PRODUCTS HAS SKYROCKETED. IN RESPONSE FARMERS CHEFS FOOD PURCHASERS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE LOOK FOR PATHWAYS TO SHORTEN THE SUPPLY LINE BETWEEN THE PRODUCER. AND THE CONSUMER SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF FRESH AND LOCALLY GROWN FOOD. THIS BILL SUPPORT SMALL SCALE POULTRY PRODUCERS AND DECREASES A NUMBER OF MILES BETWEEN FARM AND FORK. AB TWENTY NINE OH NINE GIVE SMALL SCALE POULTRY PRODUCERS LEEWAY IN EXPANDING THEIR BUSINESSES BY MAKING SURE THE FOOD SAFETY REQUIREMENTS ARE FOLLOWED. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. FOR FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH OFFICERS JUST IN MILAN A SHIFT DUSKY ES IST ESTES DUST. AND POULTRY POULTRY PRODUCER RICHARD COME TUESDAY. SPEC WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. JUST MULLIN FOR THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DIRECTIVES WE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I THINK THE RATIONALE BEHIND THIS IS TO ACTUALLY HELP BOTH. THE PRODUCES AND THE REGULATORS UNDERSTAND WOULDN'T APPROVE SOURCES RIGHT NOW PART OF THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE FEDERAL INSPECTION PROCESS. SOME OF THE. HEALTH INSPECTORS STOP THIS PRODUCT FROM BEING SOLD AT THE RETAIL STORE RETAIL LEVEL WHETHER IT'S THE FARMER'S MARKET TO ANY OF THE PLACE LIKE THAT. BY HAVING A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT CLEARLY THE INDUSTRY SUPPORTS LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BE ABLE TO. ACCEPT THIS AS AN APPROVED SOURCE ANYONE HAVE ANY HASSLES IN SELLING IT AT. THOSE RETAIL OUTLETS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORTED IT IT ECHOES THAT. PROCESS WE SET UP A FEW YEARS AGO WHO COMMUNITY SUPPORTED AGRICULTURE CSA'S SOBRE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT AND THANK THE. THE OATH OF FOR BRINGING FORWARD. HI AM DUSKY ESTES I'M CO CHEF PROPRIETOR OF ZAZU KITCHEN IMPRIME AND BLACK PIGMEAT CHO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN WOOD FRAME BITING US HERE TODAY AND FOR TRULY LISTENING TO THE SMALL FARMERS AND OUR STATE. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS WE FARM IN THREE PLACES IN CINEMA COUNTY. AND WE BUY DIRECT FROM OVER TWO HUNDRED FARMERS WE HAVE TO LAMB GUYS ONE GOAT GUY. A ONE DUCK GUY WHO'S IN THE ROOM ONE EGG LADY SIX PICK GUYS TO PEACH LADIES ONCE ROBBERY AYE THREE APPLE PEOPLE AND THE LIST GOES ON. THERE ARE MORE AND MORE CONSUMERS DEMANDING TO KNOW THE FACE THAT FEEDS YOU PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS I CONSISTENTLY HAVE SEEN THE LOSS OF SMALL FARMERS. IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET. SOME OF OUR CURRENT POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY MAKE IT HARDER. WE'RE THE ONLY STATE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT DOES NOT ALLOW SMALL POULTRY PRODUCERS TO HIRE EMPLOYEES FOR THE HARVEST. HOW DOES A YOUNG FARMER LEARN HOW TO DO THIS WITHOUT LEARNING FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S ALREADY DOING IT? AND WHY DO WE HAVE THIS RULE ANYWAY. ACCESS TO USDA SLAUGHTER IS ALSO ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN OUR STATE THERE ONLY THREE USDA POULTRY SLAUGHTER FACILITIES BUT WILL PROCESS FOR SMALL FIRMS IN OUR STATE. AND THIS IS A VERY BIG STATES. TRAVEL DISTANCES ARE GREAT AND THE YEAR LONG WEIGHTLESS FOR SLAUGHTER ARE TOO LONG. THERE IS A USDA EXEMPTION FOR SMALL POULTRY FARMERS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SLAUGHTER ON FARM AND SETTLE TO HOTELS RESTAURANTS AND INSTITUTIONS BUT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS EXEMPTION. WHAT WHY WHEN WHERE THE GREATEST AGRICULTURAL STATE AND THE CREATOR OF THE FARM TO TABLE MOVEMENT? CURRENTLY SMALL POULTRY FARMERS CAN POSSIBLY SELL AT A FARMER'S MARKET. IF THEY'RE INSPECTOR INTERPRETS THE REGULATIONS THAT WAY. AND IT'S DIFFERENT IN EVERY COUNTY. AB TWO NINE AND NINE ALLOWS FOR EMPLOYEES. AND THAT THE USE OF THE USDA EXEMPTION FOR SMALL FARMERS TO SELL DIRECT TO HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS. THIS IS NOT LESS SAFE. WHEN YOU BUY DIRECT. YOU KNOW THE SOURCE AND THERE'S GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. REGARDING FOOD SAFETY AB TWO NINE NINE NINE ALSO CREATES A SYSTEM WHERE POULTRY RANCHERS WHO WANT TO SLAUGHTER ON FARM. GET TRAINED TO BE THEIR OWN MEAT INSPECTORS LIKE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IN PLACE PER CDFA BUTCHER SHOPS. MY HUSBAND TAKES A CLASS EACH YEAR TO BE ARMY INSPECTOR. IT ALSO CLARIFIES WHAT IS ALLOWED IN TERMS OF THE HR EXEMPTION SO THERE'S NO CONFUSION WITH THE INTERPRETATION BY DIFFERENT INSPECTORS AS SOMETIMES HAPPENS NOW. AS THE MANY LETTERS OF SUPPORT MAKE CLEAR. THERE ARE MANY SHOPS FROM ACROSS THIS GREAT STATE WHO ARE FOR THIS BILL. I SPEAK FOR THEM ALL WHEN I SAY PLEASE SUPPORT AB TWO NINE NINE NINE. SO WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD. START THEIR LONG JOURNEY TO A USDA PLANT BECAUSE THEY'RE FARMER WASN'T ALLOWED TO HARVEST ON THEIR RANCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RICHARD G.*. AND MY WIFE AND I OWN AND OPERATE THE WOOKIE RANCH IN CHICO CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE BEEN FARMING SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE AS YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED WE REYES PASTURED POULTRY AS WELL SHEEP AND HOGS. SINCE THIS HEARING IS ABOUT POULTRY. I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE HARPAL DROP REGIME WORKS SO YOU CAN ALL BE POULTRY FARMERS. THERE ARE FOUR BASIC STEPS BROODING GROWING HARVESTING IN MARKETING. ON DAY ONE WE PICK UP DAY OLD CHICKS FROM THE POST OFFICE AND PLACE THEM IN A WARM DRIVE BRUDER FOR UP TO TWO WEEKS. AFTER THAT THE CHICKENS GO OUT ON THE PASTOR TO GROW FOR THE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE WEEKS. THAT AN APPROXIMATE FORTY TWO TO FORTY NINE DAYS THE CHICKENS ARE HARVESTED ON OUR FARM. IN ACCORDANCE WITH CURRENT STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. FINING THE CHICKENS ARE TAKEN TO OUR LOCAL FARMERS MARKETS AND SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. TODAY TO BE EXEMPT FROM BOTH FEDERAL INSPECTION AND STATE REGISTRATION. HOW FAR CAN ONLY GROW ON CROSSES ONE THOUSAND BIRDS OR LESS ANNUALLY ADDITIONALLY IN CALIFORNIA TO BE SOLD AT THE LOCAL FARMERS MARKET? THOSE BIRDS NEED TO BE PROCESSED BY QUOTE IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND QUOTE ONLY. AND CAN ONLY BE SOLD DIRECTLY TO THE END CONSUMER. FINALLY IN MODE AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY. THESE ONE THOUSAND BIRDS PROCESSED ON FARM CURRENTLY HAVE NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL MEET WITH APPROVED SOURCE. STATUS FROM LOCAL COUNTY HEALTH OFFICIALS ALLOWING THEM TO BE SOLD AT ALL. THE CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE CONFUSING TO MANY WOULD BE POULTRY PRODUCERS AS WELL AS TO REGULATORS. AB TWENTY NINE OH NINE ADDRESSES THE SHORTCOMINGS. AB TWENTY NINE OH NINE WILL LIE A LINE STATE LAW WITH FEDERAL LAW AND PROVIDE SOME GAIN. CHANGING BENEFITS OF SMALL SCALE POULTRY PRODUCERS THE BILL WILL. ALLOW SMALL SCALE POULTRY. PRODUCERS CLARITY ON THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE GROWING HARVESTING IN MARKETING OF POULTRY. ALLOW SMALL SCALE PRODUCERS TO HIRE EMPLOYEES TO HELP WITH HARVESTING. ALLOW SMALL SCALE PRODUCERS TO SELL TO OTHER BUSINESSES WERE RESULT. AS MEAT OR MEALS INCLUDING A DISTRIBUTOR HOTEL RESTAURANT RETAIL STORE INSTITUTION OR SMALL AND A PRESENT FROM THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS QUOTED. PER THE FEDERAL EXEMPTION. AMEND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO DEEM THAT POULTRY MEAT PRODUCED PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB TWENTY NINE OH NINE IS FROM THE PROOF SOURCE. PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THOSE WILL BUY FROM SMALL SCALE PRODUCERS. THESE WILL BE TRAINED AS DOES HE SAID. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY NINE OH NINE I UNDERSTAND THAT MY FARM WILL HAVE TO REGISTER WITH THE CD FAA AND PAN ANNUAL FEE. TAKE CDFA TRAINING. AND MEET CDFA SANITATION AND TRACEABILITY GUIDELINES I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS APPROACH BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY NINE OH NINE. WILL PROVIDE HUGE BENEFITS TO SMALL SCALE POULTRY PRODUCERS CONSUMERS AND REGULATORS ALIKE. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTION ABOUT CHICKENS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. BENJAMIN PALMER ON BEHALF OF MARIN COUNTY IN SUPPORT. MICHALEK TO CHANGE WE'RE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. CATHERINE QUAN BACK THE NICHE MEAT PROCESSOR SYSTEMS NETWORK AT TRADE ORGANIZATION FOR SMALL PROCESSORS IN SUPPORT. KELLY AS MEN US FAMILY FARM.

THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE IN OPPOSITION QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. YOU MAY CONCLUDE. JUST EVERITT RESPECT WEST EUROPE AYE VOTE IF YOU WANT TO SEE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO WITH WITH SOME OF FOOD FROM SMALL FARMERS WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S LIVESTOCK ORDER.

PART OF THE BIG PART OF OUR FOOD MOVEMENT IN CINEMA COUNTY AND I THANK THEM FOR EVERYTHING THEY DO. IT'S GREAT WELL THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY APPRECIATED VERY MUCH THIS BILL DOES. ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET A QUORUM BUT WE'RE STILL ONE SHORT SO ONCE WE GET A QUORUM WILL START WORKING ON THESE BILLS. VERY MUCH TYPICALLY SO MUCH. AND. WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING REALLY WELL AYE WE IF WE CAN GET. THE LAST COUPLE OF AUTHORS HERE. AND MR MATHIS BACK THEN WE CAN JUST A SLAM THROUGH THESE. SO WE'RE DOWN TO THE LAST. TO.

THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE I HAVE NO WHERE TO BE BUT WHERE YOU WANT ME MADAM CHAIR I'M HERE FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT. YOU MAY PROCEED PERCENT PRESENT NOW THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE. A BILL THAT WILL POSITION CALIFORNIA AS A LEADER AS IT RELATES TO YOU HUMANE POULTRY SLAUGHTER PRACTICE. I DON'T THINK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS BILL ON ALL SIDES. AND. WE ARE COMMITTED THE DEFINING WORKABLE WAYS TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. AND WE THINK THAT WE'VE LANDED ON SOLUTIONS THAT CAN CAN WORK. OUT WE HAVE HEARD THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND WE ARE PROPOSING A SOLUTION. A AND HAVE SHARED THE SOLUTION THAT WE THINK WILL WORK. AND I'M COMMITTED TO A CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AYE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. SPECIFICALLY CALLING FOR A STATE FUND TO AID SMALL FALLERS SMALL I'M SORRY SMALL FARMERS TO. COMPLY WITH WHAT THIS BILL PURPORTS TO DO. I PROPOSED AMENDING THE BILL ALONG AND WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF. CREATE A FUND THAT ALLOW STATE AND PRIVATE DOLLARS TO MAKE EQUIPMENT UPGRADES ZERO COSTS SMALL BUSINESSES. NO WE WILL CONDITION THE NEW REGULATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF STATE FUNDS. EVEN AT THE MOST EXPENSIVE WE ESTIMATE. OF THAT TWO THOUSAND AND NEW EQUIPMENT FOR SIXTY FARMS. WOULD BE CIRCA HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FIGURE THAT WE THINK. IS WITHIN MEANS. FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF OF THIS HOUSE IN A THAT WE CAN. WORK WITH. I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ON ONE THING THAT. YOU KNOW. SEE FOR MYSELF I I'M NOT A VEGETARIAN I'M NOT A VEGAN. I ENJOY EATING MEAT AND. I HAVE NO DESIRE TO SEE. ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT TO THE POULTRY INDUSTRY. IT DOES NOT SERVE MY PURPOSES I DON'T THINK IT SERVES ANYONE'S PURPOSES OR CALIFORNIA'S PURPOSES. AND AND IT IS WITH THAT. APPROACH THAT I HOPE YOU WILL EXPECT SET. WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE? I'VE HAD WITH ME TODAY A WITNESS FROM THE HUMANE SOCIETY WISHES TO. OFFER A LITTLE BIT MORE EMPHASIS HERE. ADDUCTOR SARA SHIELDS IN IF YOU WOULD. WELCOME HER. HOW ARE WITNESSES? IT'S STUCK IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE THAT RESPECT WE ASK YOU AYE VOTE. THANKS VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IS THERE ANYONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WE DON'T HAVE ANY. BUT THEN IT. IF I IF I COULD JUST A MINUTE IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE THE WITNESS IT WAS GOING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT JUST WALKED IN. A RELEASE IS HERE BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO. WHEN IT WENT AWAY TO LET HER TAKE THAT SEAT RIGHT THERE AND THEN REALLY GO AHEAD AND. KEEP YOURS AND THEN WILL PROCEED AFTERWARDS. WELCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. IF YOU MADAM CHAIR A DOCTOR SHARE SHIELDS ARE WITNESS FROM THE HUMANE SOCIETY. I'M I'M SERIOUS SHIELDS HAVE. BEHAVIOR AND WELFARE SPECIALIST FOR HUMANE SOCIETY INTERNATIONAL AND I DID MY DOCTORAL WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ON POULTRY BEHAVIOR AND WELFARE. I AM THERE SIMPLY NO BIOLOGICAL REASON TO EXEMPT POULTRY FROM THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS PURCHASE SHACKLING. HANGING A BIRD IN AN INVERTED POSITION IS AND PHYSIOLOGICALLY ABNORMAL POSTURE FOR. A BIRD AND YOU CAN TAKE A BLOOD SAMPLE AND MEASURE A RISE IN STRESS HORMONES SO WE KNOW IT'S A STRESSFUL PROCESS FOR THEM. SHACKLES HAVE TO BE TIGHT FITTING BUT THE LEGS CHICKENS VERY AND SO HANGING OPERATORS CAN USE CONSIDERABLE FORCE TO PERFECT LEGS INTO NARROW SHACKLES. BIRD STRUGGLE ON THE LINE THEY HAVE NOCICEPTIVE PAIN RECEPTORS IN THEIR LEGS AND FEET SO WE KNOW IT'S PAINFUL BRUISING IS DOCUMENTED. BROILER CHICKENS ARE PRONE TO DEBILITATING LAMENESS AND LEG DISORDERS AND SO WHEN YOU HANG THEM UPSIDE DOWN YOU ARE EXACERBATING LIKE PROBLEMS THAT THEY ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING. SO GIVEN OTHER RESEARCH THERE'S NO GOOD REASON TO EXEMPT POULTRY AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE SIMPLY MAKES THE ROLE MORE CONSISTENT. BY EXTENDING THE SAME REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE FOR OTHER ANIMALS. THERE ARE SEVERAL GOOD ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN BE USED. AND THERE'S HAD ONLY ELECTRICAL STANDING THERE'S CAPTIVE BOGAN STUNNING WITH POULTRY SIZE A CAPTIVE BOTH GUNS. AND GAS STUNNING IS ALSO A POTENTIAL POSSIBILITY. I AM IDEALLY YOU WOULD WANT THE BIRDS TO BE RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS BEFORE TURNING THEM UPSIDE DOWN. BUT THERE IS A METHOD WHERE YOU CAN USE A CONE TO PUT THE BIRDS AND YOU CAN STUN THEM QUICKLY AND EASILY WITH A CAPTIVE BOTH STEINER. AND THEY'RE COMPLETELY UNCONSCIOUS BEFORE YOU EVER POUNDS BUT THEIR THROAT. AND THE BENEFIT OF. DOING THIS IF THERE'S NOT ONLY AN ANIMAL WELFARE BENEFIT BUT THERE'S ALSO A POTENTIAL BENEFIT THIS JOB. BECAUSE IF THE BIRDS ARE ALREADY RENDERED ANNOUNCED IN AND SENSIBLE BEFORE THEY'RE HUNG ON THE LINE THERE'S LESS FLATTER. LESS WING FLAPPING LESS DIRT LESS NOISE LESS EXCREMENT WEST FEATHER DANDER. CALIFORNIANS CARE ABOUT ANIMALS THEY CARE ABOUT ANIMALS ON THE FARM THE CARROT SLAUGHTER ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE PURCHASING FROM A LOCAL. SMALL SCALE PROCESSOR THEY EXPECT THAT TREATMENT OF THE ANIMALS TO BE MORE HUMANE. SO WE FEEL THAT A. B. THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE HELPS. PROCESSORS MEET CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS FOR HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO LOOKS LIKE WE THINK YOU WRITE REALLY DO APPRECIATE LOOKS LIKE WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND TAKE ROLE BECAUSE. COMEY ARROW THERE. MATHIS HERE. ADHERE CURRY FLORA GALLAGHER. GRAY. IRWIN. JONES SAWYER. LEVINE SALAS. OKAY NOW THAT WE HAVE A QUORUM THERE ARE THREE ITEMS THAT ARE ON OUR AGENDA AS CONSENT AGENDA ITEMS NUMBER ONE E. BE.

MEMBERS TO ADD ON WILL RESUME WITH THE HEARING AND. OPPOSITION. OH I'M SORRY. THE IN SUPPORT NICHOLAS SACKETT REPRESENTS SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION IN SUPPORT ALSO COURTESY OF SUPPORT FROM HUMANE SOCIETY UNITED STATES. AND MERCY FOR ANIMALS. THANK YOU. YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ROBERT SIEGEL WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AND WE ARE OPPOSED AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE. FARM BUREAU REPRESENTS NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS ACROSS ALL SECTIONS CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND BE VERY CLEAR. FARM BUREAU STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS AND WOULD NEVER CONDONE THEIR MISSION DID THEIR MISTREATMENT. WE SUPPORT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BUT HUMANE CARE OF LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY IS DEVELOPED THROUGH SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. INDUSTRY TESTED PRACTICES OR SET FORTH IN THE ANIMAL CARE SERIES PUBLISHED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE COOP COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT EXISTING LAW AND EXISTING REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY CDFA. CLEARLY ESTABLISHED ACCEPTABLE AND PRACTICAL HUMANE METHODS FOR THE USE OF STUNNING OF POULTRY. FURTHER ABSENT ANY DATA FROM CDFA INDICATING A HIGHER CURRENTS OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE ARE IN HUMANE SLAUGHTER OF POULTRY IN CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COMPRESSIBILITY COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE WILL HAVE NO IMPACT. ON THE LARGER SCALE COMMERCIAL POULTRY OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THOSE INSPECTED BY USDA. IN FACT THE FIFTY FIVE CDFA INSPECTED FACILITIES MANY OF WHICH ARE SMALL MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SOME CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION MEMBERS. WILL BEAR THE UNNECESSARY BURDENS A MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS CDFA HAS IN FACT INDICATED TO COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL IMPACT ROUGHLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE BUSINESSES. THAT ARE ON THE LIST THAT WAS HANDED OUT RIGHT BEFORE OUR TESTIMONY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS FAIR THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES OR OUR MEMBERS. MEET NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT OUR DEVELOPED IN A VACUUM WITHOUT THE EXPERTISE OF CDFA. WITHOUT BROADER PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH INDUSTRY. AND WITHOUT DEMONSTRATE THAT DEMONSTRATING A CLEAR NECESSITY. THIS BILL ONLY MAKES IT MORE FINANCIALLY DIFFICULT FOR CALIFORNIA'S MINORITY BUSINESS OWNERS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE OCCURRENCE OF WORKPLACE INJURIES AND IN HUMANE SLAUGHTER AND IGNORES THE IMPACT THAT THESE BUSINESSES HAVE. IN RELATION TO SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA FARM TO FORK MOVEMENT. AND INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY FOOD PRODUCTS FOR OTHER CALIFORNIANS. FOR THESE REASONS CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU RESPECT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE. I THINK VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BROUGHT RECENTLY HAVE CALIFORNIA POULTRY FEDERATION. WILL ECH THE COMMENTS THAT THE ROBERT JUST. OUTLINED FOR THE COMMITTEE. AGAIN OUR FUNDAMENTAL PROMISES HE'S OR OUR BELIEF IS THAT THE PROMISE IS INCORRECT. THAT DECISION HUMANE TREATMENT OF BIRDS OF THIS ACCEPTED PRACTICE IT HAS BEEN LOOKED AT SCIENTIFICALLY. AND IN OUR VIEW. IS THIS BILL PRESUPPOSES THAT ONE. OR MAKE ANY NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES. OF STUNNING ARE MORE HUMANE. THAT IS NOT BEEN. WHAT HAS BEEN FOUND SCIENTIFICALLY? AND. WE'RE JUST UNCOMFORTABLE WITH PROMISE AND HAVE TO STRONGLY POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. BUT AIMS JIM REICHARDT AYE ON CINEMA COUNTY POULTRY AND. I'M SPEAKING ANECDOTALLY. BECAUSE I I HAVE NO NO SCIENTIFIC. BEHIND ME BUT MY FAMILY'S BEEN SLAUGHTERING BIRD SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO. ANY OTHER STATE INSPECTED REALIZED HE A PLAN. AND BEEN CHUCKLE THE ENTIRE TIME AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT YOU'RE THE PERSON HANGING TO BIRDS NEEDS TO BE TRAINED WELL AND NEEDS TO BE TREATING THE VIRTUE MAINLY. BUT PAST THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF. OF DISCOMFORT. SO. THEY HAVE TO BE STANDING NOW ANYHOW. AND THE SHACKLING IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND AND IT'S ACCEPTED. PRACTICE IT'S NOT. THE BIRDS DON'T APPEAR TO BE. GOING THROUGH ANY LARGE AMOUNTS OF STRESS IN ORDER TO DO THAT. THANK YOU THINK. FOR ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. QUESTION FROM THE COMMITTEE. I JUST WANTED BLOOD. BUT DID THE AUTHOR. TALK ABOUT PROP PROVIDING SOME. FINANCIAL REMEDY TO THIS AND AND I KNOW. I WOULD THINK THE INDUSTRY WOULD MIND GOING TO A MORE HUMANE. WAY OF DOING THIS. AND SINCE A LOT OF THESE. INDUSTRIES HAPPEN TO BE MY DISTRICT. IT'S OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME THAT. WE AS A LEGISLATURE DON'T. CREATE UNDUE ECONOMIC HARM TO ANYONE WE WE LEGISLATE ALL THE TIME. AND. THE SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF IT. ON ENCOURAGE. THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO CREATE SOME. SOME WAIT FINANCIALLY ENSURE THAT THIS INDUSTRY DOESN'T GO OUT OF BUSINESS THAT THIS INDUSTRY DOESN'T BECOME FINANCIALLY. STRAPPED WITH REGULATIONS THAT WE. CLING ON I'M IN OWNERS WAY. AND SO I I I TAKE THE WORD OF THE AUTHOR THAT HE WILL. WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME ARM. BOTTOM. SOME WAYS TO GET THROUGH THIS ITEM. FINANCIAL QUAGMIRE AND DUBBED. AND I I I WILL VOTE FOR TODAY BUT I WILL. IF IT GETS OUT OF HERE O. DEFTLY RESERVE. ANY VOTE ON THE FLOOR. IF THERE IS NO FINANCIAL. WAY OF GETTING AROUND THIS. MY VOTE MAY CHANGE DRAMATICALLY. ANYONE ELSE. MR MATHIS. MR THURMAN I. THEY IS VICE CHAIR OF BAG OF TRAVEL ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND I'VE VISITED. MANY FARMS WHERE CHICKENS ARE GROWN I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OBSCENE. AND IN THEIR SEVEN DIFFERENT METHODS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED AND I'VE PRETTY MUCH SEEN THEM ALL NOT TO MENTION I'M A COUNTRY BOY AND I'VE DONE IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. TO. IN IN MY MIND TO STEP AWAY FROM THE ELECTRICAL PATH MATH THE. IT IS KIND OF A STEP BACKWARDS I MEAN AND IT'S A PROCESS THAT WORKS IT CLEANS THE BIRD IT ACTUALLY TAKES DOWN THE DOWNTURN EVERYTHING ELSE IT IT. IT THE WE WENT THAT DIRECTION FOR A REASON. BEAT BECAUSE IT IS A CLEANER PROCESS. A I JUST. TO ME THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT DOESN'T ADD UP THERE'S ALREADY THINGS BEING DONE. INSTEAD SHE TO OF HAVE AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD A A. THEN IN MISTER THEM IN THIS IS NOTHING ON THE AYE I THINK THIS IS MORE THE. PROPONENTS OF THIS LEGISLATION I THINK THEY'VE GOT TO SING ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE MY FRIEND. PUN INTENDED. ALL YOU. POULTRY ALL HERE. IT'S. THERE'S THERE'S A LOT MORE HERE. THEY A REALLY DID TO BRING IN THE FINANCIAL BACKING PIECE IT'S IT'S NOT IN THERE CURRENTLY. THERE'S NOT AMENDMENTS BEFORE US. DAYS. ALREADY BEEN STATED OF HER ON THE DIET SAY I THINK. ASKING ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING WITHOUT FUNDING TO BACK UP THIS COMPLETELY PREPOSTEROUS. THEY I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE HERE. ON THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE THE SNOW SPORTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING TODAY BUT IT'S NOT AND. I WORK WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED ONE OTHER THINGS MAN AND WE DO A LOT OF GOOD WORK. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT SENT YOU THIS GOT IT RIGHT. THANK YOU. DEGREE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE I THINK THE INTENT OR THE AUTHOR'S COMING FROM. ON THIS. THEY ALWAYS ASK MYSELF WHAT A BILLS BEFORE US. HAS THREE BASIC QUESTIONS THE FIRST MAN IS THEIR PROBLEM. IF I DECIDE THERE IS THEM. IT'S JUST A PROBLEM THE STATE SHOULD SOLVE. AND. AND IF I GET PAST QUESTION DO I GET TO DOES THIS BILL ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH SOLVING THAT PROBLEM. I'M NOT SURE. I MIGHT YOU STRIKE NOW ALL THREE OF THOSE QUESTIONS ON THE BILL BEFORE ME. BUT AS I HEAR THE DISCUSSION. AROUND PUT SOME FINANCES YOU HYPER ALTERNATIVE METHODS IN THIS AND THAT. WHAT IS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR THE AUTHORS? WHY WOULDN'T YOU HAVE APPROACH THIS ISSUE? BY CREATING AND AND. A CARROT UP A FUND TO. VOLUNTARILY OFFER FOR THE STATE TO OFFER TO. FOLKS WANT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CHANGING A METHOD SERVE OR IMPLEMENTING NEW. TECHNOLOGY THAT SEEMS LIKE A WAY TO GET AFTER THE PROBLEM ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. BUT THE BILL BEFORE ME JUST SEEMS. MISPLACED IN THE IN THE WAY IT GOES ABOUT SOME PROPS ARE ALL THAT YOU ARE RESPOND. ARE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE PASSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE INCENTIVES AND WE'RE OPEN TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH INDUSTRY AND. WITH YOU KNOW FARMERS AND WITH THOSE WHO HAVE ALL KINDS OF EXPERIENCE AND I THINK. THAT THERE IS STILL THE OPPORTUNITY FOR. AN INCENTIVE CONVERSATION. I I WOULD SAY THIS AND IT YOU KNOW I DO NOT QUESTION THE EXPERIENCE OF ANYONE AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT I HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE I DON'T. I DO KNOW THIS. THAT A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS. HAVE ASKED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE HUMANE A USES AS RELATES TO SLAUGHTER PALTRY. AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTION OF THE INDUSTRY HAS HAS MOVED IN. AND. I ALSO ACCEPT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE OF. PROVISIONS HELP THE SMALLER. COMPANIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ABSORB WHAT LARGE COMPANIES CAN AND AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND SO. WE'RE BEING CREATIVE IN OUR APPROACH IN SAYING THAT WE WILL PROVIDE DOLLARS TO DO THAT TO OFFSET THAT COST TO MAKE IT IS ZERO. OFFSET. AND IF WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT AS YOU SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAP THIS WE WORK TOGETHER. A HUNDRED AND ONE TIMES ON THINGS THAT YOU ALL KNOW ME IF I SAY I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING I DO IT. AND IF I CAN'T DO IT YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER BECAUSE I WOULD WITHDRAW THE BILL BEFORE DOING THAT. BECAUSE WHEN I SAY I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING THAT'S HOW I CARRY MYSELF. AS I SAID AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE DATA CALIFORNIANS OVERWHELMINGLY HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL LIKE TO SEE. MORE HUMANE PRACTICES AS IT RELATES TO THE SLAUGHTER OF POULTRY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. AT IN MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION WE'VE UNCOVERED THAT FOR SOME BUSINESSES MANY OF THEM SMALL MINORITY WHO I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. THAT THEY WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND SO NOW WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP OFFSET THEIR COSTS. WHY WOULDN'T WE TAKE THAT ACTION IS WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU WHY WOULD IT WHEN? WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A WIN A WIN AND A WIN WHERE EVERYONE WINS AND AS I'VE SAID. IF I CAN'T DELIVER ON WHAT I PROPOSE. YOU WON'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE BECAUSE I WON'T PUT IT BEFORE YOU IN ANOTHER FORMAT SO I AM ASKING YOU TODAY. FOR YOUR VOTE I'M ASKING YOU TODAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY TO SEE THAT THERE IS A YES BEHIND THOSE THREE QUESTIONS THAT THERE IS A CHALLENGE IT CALIFORNIA'S A BASS US. TO ADDRESS THAT THE STATE HAS A ROLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIFT UP SOME ADDITIONAL BEST PRACTICES AND IF THE STATE'S GOING TO CREATE A REGULATION AND AS A WAY TO PROVIDE DOLLARS TO DO THAT. THE STATE SHOULD DO THAT THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THERE ARE MANY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO HAVE OFFERED TO STEP UP TO HELP TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO IT'S NOT ALL JUST ON THE STATE'S DONE. SO THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR INCENTIVE THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR GOVERNMENT DOLLARS AND THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR PRIVATE DOLLARS THE ONE TO MAKE THIS A REALITY. AND. I THINK WE CAN CREATE A DEEP PARTNERSHIP IN HOW WE TALK ABOUT THIS I WANT. THE FOLKS FROM INDUSTRY TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS CONVERSATION. THIS IS NOT TO BE A BLAME GAME THIS CAN BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE TOGETHER CAN MAKE SOMETHING EFFECTIVELY HAPPEN. THINK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOSING. YES I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE THEM I CLOSE. UNLESS SOMEONE HAS ANOTHER QUESTION FROM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THINK YOU THINK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE SAYS ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SO MR THURMAN WE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND. AYE AYE THAT IN IN REALITY WHAT I HEAR THE INDUSTRY SAYING IS THAT. IS THAT THIS MAY NOT BE THE MOST HUMANE. AND THEY'RE NOT SURE THAT THE SCIENCE. THE SCIENCE IS BEHIND THAT. BUT. BUT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS. OBVIOUSLY I I DO WANT TO BE THE MOST HUMANE AND I'M HOPING THAT IT IS. BUT. BUT MY ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES. AND I THINK MR GRAY RAISES A GOOD ISSUE WHICH IS. MAKING IT A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WITH MONEY BEHIND IT IS IS PROBABLY WAY TO BE ABLE TO. TO REACH A COMPROMISE BUT IN ANY CASE WHAT I TOLD YOU IS THAT IF YOU CAN COME UP WITH A FUNDING. I. I THAT ADDRESSES ONE OF MY BIGGEST ISSUES ON MOST OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE SMALL MINORITY BUSINESSES. AND. MOST OF THEM QUITE FRANKLY ARE IN THE BIG CITIES AYE WHICH SURPRISED ME. ON AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE IN IN IN RURAL CALIFORNIA PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF IT THEMSELVES THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK BUT IN THE CITIES THEY TAKE THEY GO TO THESE BIGGER. FACILITIES. OR THESE ARE URBAN FACILITIES. SO I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT OF TODAY. IT IT'S NOT IN THE BILL BUT YEAH WE HAD A CONVERSATION AND I'M. TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. IF IF YOU. WELL AMEND YOUR BELT AND INCLUDE THAT IN IN APPROPRIATIONS WHICH I THINK IS WHERE IT GOES NEXT. I I THINK THAT WOULD IT LEAST RELIEVE THE CONCERN THE BIGGEST CONCERN I HAVE. AND I I AM CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING. JUSTIN IN TERMS OF. FOR FOR FURTHER REFERENCES THAT MOM THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF THINGS PUT ON BUSINESS AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S SOMEONE OPINION ON WHAT BUSINESS I TO DO. AND I I REALLY LIKE TO LOOK AT THAT GOOD SCIENCE AND WE'RE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK AND SO ON I'M I'M HOPING THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THIS IS A MORE HUMANE WAY OF. TREATING ANIMALS ON AND. I THE REASON I SAY I THINK I LIKE THE IDEA OF IT BEING VOLUNTARY IS BECAUSE IF IF IN FACT THE PRODUCERS. FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE. IT'S MORE HUMANE AND THAT THEY CAN BE FUNDED. AS PART OF THE DISH THAT CHANGE THEN THEY'LL DO IT AND DUMB AND THAT WOULD BE A REAL GOOD TEST OF WHETHER I THINK WHETHER. THAT KIND OF MOVE IS IS A GOOD THING FOR THE INDUSTRY SO MANY CASE THAT I I HAVE NOT ISSUED A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE COMMITTEE IT'S UP TO EVERYONE TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES. AND WE DO HAVE A A QUORUM SO I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION IF SOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE IT. THEIR SECOND. I'LL MAKE THE SECOND BECAUSE I TOLD YOU I WOULD I WOULD SUPPORT IT AT THIS POINT. AND SO THEN WILL CALL THE ROLL. AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALMLY RO. COME BEALL AYE MATHIS. MATHIS SNOW AGUIAR-CURRY FLORA GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO GRAY.

WE IT GOOD MISTER MISTER DARCY IS HERE THANK YOU. I WAS JUST GOING TO JOIN YOU MOVE THE BILL SIX SO THIS IS. ITEM NUMBER TWO ON THE AGENDA AB TWENTY ONE OH SIX. MEDICARE AND. OLLEAGUES THIS IS A BILL THAT I THINK YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH. AND THAT SAID TAKING THE EXISTING BIT PREFERENCE FROM FIVE PERCENT TO TEN PERCENT PER STATE PURCHASES RELATED TO CALIFORNIA GROWN. OR CALIFORNIA PACKED AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS OVER THOSE PRODUCED AT A STATE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THAT AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS HERE THE RUSSIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU AND WE ARE. CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF AB TWENTY ONE OF SIX WE THINK MR GARCIA FOR HIS WORK ON THIS EFFORT. AND WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE CHAIRS THE LAST YEAR EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY TWO AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL BUILDS UPON THAT SUCCESS TO ALLOW FOR GROWERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE C. PROCUREMENT PROCESS. AND CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL PROWESS ISN'T SOMETHING I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO SHARE THIS COMMITTEE YOUR WELL ACQUAINTED NOW THAT. I'M BUT IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT CALIFORNIA GROWERS DO MORE WITH LESS THAT'S BECOME A STANDARD IN IN THE STATE. AND OUR GROWERS HAVE THE HIGHEST AND ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR WAGE AND FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS ACROSS THE BOARD AND AND SO. WE DO ASK THAT JUST AS THE STATE HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THEY. ARE INVESTING IN CLIMATE SMART BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CALIFORNIA STATE AND ZERO EMISSION LOW EMISSION VEHICLES FOR STATE FLEET. OTHER SHOULD ALSO ALSO MAKE THAT PRIORITY FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. ANY COMMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE. ACTUALLY I THE QUESTION GENERALLY I LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING. IMPLEMENTED BEFORE WE INCREASE. THE PRICE AND AND FIVE PERCENT SEEMED LIKE A PRETTY. OF REASONABLE. MARGIN BETWEEN YOU KNOW TO ENCOURAGE A CALIFORNIA PRODUCE BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN. BESIDES A FEW FARMERS HAVE REACHED OUT AND SAID IT'S DIFFICULT IS THERE ARE THERE ANY STATS THAT IT MUST BE TEN PERCENT MAKE THIS. VIABLE. I CAN SPEAK TO THE FARMERS IN OUR DISTRICT. THE IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES BOTH ADJACENT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. AND OTHER STATE AND THE FACT THAT THE THE COMPETITIVENESS. THAT OCCURS BETWEEN THE AG INDUSTRIES IN THESE TWO PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE FIVE PERCENT. THEY FELT. COULD NOT. POSSIBLY MEET SOME OF THE. WHAT THEY REFER TO AS? SPILL OVER. AFFECTS OF HAVING AG. PRODUCED DIDN'T STATE OF ARIZONA AND IN MEXICO AND AS YOU KNOW OUR DISTRICT IS ADJACENT TO THE MEXICAN BORDER OF ALEX EQUAL MICKEY KILEY WHICH IS. A CITY OF ABOUT A MILLION PLUS PEOPLE AND AG IS ONE OF THE BIG INDUSTRIES IN THAT AREA AS WELL ALSO. TRYING TO MAKE THEM. MORE COMPETITIVE IN OUR REGION THAT WAS ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES HERE. OKAY.
