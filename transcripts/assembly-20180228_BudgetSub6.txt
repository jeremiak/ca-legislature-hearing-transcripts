CALL THE MEETING OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SIX. TO. WE'RE GONNA WAIT TO COLOR TO ORDER BY THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET STARTED WITH OUR. AGENDA. AND THE WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN BY. REVIEWING THE SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA REPORT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN OPTED TO CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE. ADAPTATION WE HAVE MISTER BRIGHT FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES. MR BRIGHT WELCOME. WE COPY. MR. BUT THEY APPEAR. OKAY HAVE ALREADY OKAY. THEY ARE PERFECT. SO. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY. I. WORKED FOR LONGTIME THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I'M. IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE BACK HERE. I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS PLAN THAT I THINK DOES A LOT OF SIMILARITIES TO THE WORK THAT YOU DO IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS BUT ALSO. IN THE BUDGET. AS A WHOLE. I'M HERE TO TALK TODAY ABOUT. GENERALLY WHAT WE ARE DOING AT THE STATE TO PROTECT STATE SERVICES TO. BUT I. WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE PROTECT STATE SERVICES FROM THE IMPACT CLIMATE CHANGE BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY I AM HERE TO PRESENT ON THE SAFE CUTTING CALIFORNIA PLAN WHICH REALLY IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR? HOW OUR DEPARTMENTS AND OUR AGENCIES PLAN TO ENSURE THAT SERVICES ARE DELIVERED TO THE PEOPLE THAT DEPEND ON THEM IN THE? OVER TIME AS WE SEE THESE CHANGES OCCUR. SO. WHETHER WE. YOU KNOW. WHETHER WE TALK ABOUT FIRES FLOODS DROUGHTS. OR AND INCREASING HEAT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ARE ACCELERATING THEM ALL AROUND US RIGHT NOW. AND. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SEE THOSE IMPACTS FRONT AND CENTER IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO. CAN OF LOOK JUST BEYOND THOSE IMPACTS BECAUSE WHILE THOSE. ARE OFTENTIMES CATASTROPHES AND HAVE INCREDIBLE SHOCKS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR OUR COMMUNITIES. BEHIND THOSE THOSE IMPACTS YOU REALLY HAVE. YOU REALLY HAVE A. THE MULTIPLICATION OF THOSE SHOCKS THROUGHOUT. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT. COMMUNITIES AND SERVICES THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON ACROSS THE STATE. IN MANY WAYS THE WAY THOSE THOSE THOSE EVENTS MULTIPLY ACROSS LANDSCAPE ALSO CONSTRAINS HOW THEM STATE GOVERNMENTS ABLE TO PROVIDE. SERVICES TO TO PEOPLE AND TO. CENTER TIPTON NATURAL SYSTEMS AND. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS IS PUT TOGETHER A BLUEPRINT SO THAT OUR STATE AGENCIES CAN. CAN CAN BREAK THIS DOWN INTO SMALLER BITES AND AND KIND OF GET AWAY FROM WHAT IS OFTEN REALLY PARALYZING AND DAUNTING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE FACE. SO IS THAT IS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS AND GET TO THE REPORT A MINUTE BUT IN IT WHEN WE HAD OUR WHEN WE HAD A RECENT. CAN A SOMEWHAT RECENT DROUGHT. YOU KNOW WE HAD UP IN THE FRONT WE HAD WE HAD AGRICULTURAL AND. AND MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY. ISSUES STARING AT US DALY BUT THEN. BEHIND THOSE ISSUES WE REALLY SAW THESE THESE WE SAW THOSE IMPACTS KIND OF SPREAD ACROSS SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND POLICY AREAS THAT YOU GUYS FOCUS ON IT SUBCOMMITTEES. AND WE HAD INCREASED NEEDS FOR FOOD ASSISTANCE THEM ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE THERE WAS SPIKING AND EMPLOYMENT FROM LACK OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. WE HAD. WE HAD YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SNOWPACK AND AND AND A LOT AND AND INCREASED HEAT WHICH WHICH MULTIPLY THE DROUGHTS IMPACTS. WE HAD. UNPRECEDENTED STRESS ON OUR STATES FOREST IN IN IN A WE SEE THE FIRES THAT THAT THAT THAT. THE THAT THAT SITUATION LENDS TO BUT WHAT WE DON'T SEE IS THAT. THE REGION'S THE RURAL REGIONS. ARE ALSO START FROM TOURISM AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY EXPERIENCE IMPACTS THAT. ARE INITIALLY CAUSED BY THESE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. SO THE SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA PLAN. IS REALLY INTENDED TO. TO. LOOK ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT ANTICIPATE THE IMPACTS THAT WERE. EXPERIENCING BASING ON. YOU KNOW THAT THE MOST UP TO DATE SCIENCE AND INFORMATION THAT'S COMING OUR WAY. BUT THEN. DIGGIN AND ACTUALLY SERVE A OUR PROGRAMS ARE PROGRAM MANAGERS ARE STATE AGENCIES FOR WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO TO TO TO. WHAT THEY'RE DOING CURRENTLY? TO RESPOND OF THESE IMPACTS. BUT ALSO WHETHER THAN ONE OF THE THE THE REALISTIC BUT AMBITIOUS NEXT STEPS THEY SHOULD BE ENGAGING IN. WHAT WE WANNA DO IS PRESENT AN ARC OF WORK THAT THAT IS ACHIEVABLE FOR THESE AGENCIES SO WERE WERE WERE SETTING A BAR? THAT CAN JUST CONSISTENTLY PUSH OUR PROGRAMS TO PLACES WHERE THEY ARE. THEY ARE THEY ARE BEING MORE RESPONSIVE IN BEING MORE AMBITIOUS BUT THEY'RE ALSO. BEING REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT IS WHAT IS POSSIBLE AS THEY FACE THESE ISSUES. THE SCOPE OF THE PLAN IS IS IS VERY. DELIBERATELY CONSTRAINED AROUND STATE GOVERNMENT. WE WANTED THE PLAN TO SERVE AS A. CLEAN TOOL FOR STATE POLICY MAKERS LIKE YOURSELVES. TO LOOK AT TO LOOK AT OUR STATE PROGRAMS AND LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND REALLY BE ABLE TO ASSESS. IF OUR RESPONSES ADEQUATE IF WE NEED TO PUSH HARDER OR IF WE NEED TO YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE IF THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS THAT WERE WERE MISSING IN OUR IN OUR RESPONSE. IT ALSO. PUSHES OUR STATE AGENCIES TO TO INCORPORATE CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE THAT THE STATE. PRIMARILY THE STATE BUT OTHER PARTNERS ARE INVESTING IN RIGHT NOW THAT WILL BE COMING OUT LATER THIS YEAR THAT WILL THERE BUT THAT THAT THE PROVIDES DOWN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD TYPE DATA. ON WHAT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE ARE SO THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES THAT WERE SHOULD WE WE EXPECTED IN ON A COASTAL COMMUNITY VERSES THE TEMPERATURE INCHED INCREASES THAT WILL EXPERIENCE. UP IN THE M. UP IN THE UP IN THE FOOTHILLS UP TO THE MOUNTAINS. AND AND THAT THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALLOWS THOSE WHERE WE HAVE STATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. IT ALLOWS THEM TO MODIFY THEIR PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT THAT REALLY IS RESPONSIVE TO THE CONDITIONS AT HAND AND THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY EXPECT TO TO SEE IN THE FUTURE. WE ARE ALSO BUILDING BEHIND THAT SCIENCE WE'RE BUILDING. TOOLS ANALYTICAL TOOLS TO ALLOW THESE POP POLICYMAKERS TO SEE VISUALLY AND SPATIALLY HOW THOSE IMPACTS WILL BE IMPACTING THEM AND THOSE TOOLS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL. SO. I THINK THE STORY OF HOW HOW THE SAFEGUARDING PLAN WAS DEVELOPED IS ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS THE CONTENT OF THE PLAN. THE PLAN ITSELF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCIES IS DIRECTED BY STATUTE TO ORGANIZE PRODUCTION OF THIS PLAN BUT IT REALLY IS. IT REALLY IS A A STATEWIDE DOCUMENT THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE CONTROL OVER OUR CHANNEL BUT WE DON'T. QUITE HAVE AUTHORITY TO TO TO DICTATE HOW OTHER AGENCIES DO THEIR BUSINESS SO WE ENGAGED IN AN IN AN UNPRECEDENTED. COLLABORATE COLLABORATED COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT ALMOST OVER THIRTY DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. GUM CONTRIBUTING TO THIS BOOK. AND WORK AND I AM. I THINK THE SOCIALIZING ASPECT IS FOR ME IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST TAKEAWAYS IS THAT YOU KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE I'VE REALLY SEEN A SHIFT WHERE. IN THE PAST THAT THE CLIMATE THE CLIMATE PLANNING ELEMENTS OF OUR STATE AGENCIES AND STATE DEPARTMENTS. AND A LOT OF WAYS IS REALLY SILENT OFF FROM THAT FROM THE DAY TO DAY BUSINESS THAT ARE THAT ARE DEPARTMENTS GO THEN ENGAGE IN. AND AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW ARE THESE THIS KIND OF THIS TIGHTER INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND IN IN THE THE EVERYDAY PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL OVER AGENCIES. WE STRUCTURE THIS PLAN MUCH LIKE A BUDGET IS STRUCTURED WE WE ORGANIZED AROUND. STE ELEVEN KEY POLICY AREAS SO THING OF A FEW MORE THAN THE SUB COMMITTEES BUT WE WE BATCH THEM IN MANY WAYS LIKE THEIR PASSED IN SUBCOMMITTEE. WE ORGANIZED AROUND PROGRAM ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN POLICIES SO SO IT YOU KNOW YOU WHEN YOU READ TO THE PLAN YOU'LL SEE THINGS LOOK A LOT LIKE. BCP'S AND AND AND NEXT YOU KNOW AND AN EXPENDITURE REPORTS. WE. IN EACH POLICY AREA WE WE WE WE STARTED WITH COME HIGH LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEMES IN THAT WE BUILT. WE BUILT OUT RECOMMENDATIONS UNDERNEATH THAT FOR THE PROGRAMS. AND. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT REALLY IS INTENDED TO DOIS TO GIVE GIVE THOSE INTERESTED IN DIFFERENT POLICY AREAS. JUST A WAY TO TO WHEN THEY ASK WHEN THE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE THE TIME TO ASK THE QUESTION ARE WE PREPARED TO RESPOND CLIMATE CHANGE. IN THIS SPECIFIC POLICY AREA IT REALLY GIVES THAT PERSON BLUEPRINT START ASKING QUESTIONS OF DRILLING DOWN AND PUSHING ON THE AGENCIES AND AND AND HOLDING HOLDING FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE. I HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES I WANTED TO TALK YOU THROUGH IN THE PLANT SO IT'S NOT JUST ME TALKING BUT. I THINK THE FIRST ONE I WANTED TO TURN TO IS ON PAGE. I'M JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW THE THAT THE PLAN IS STRUCTURED. AND GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW THEY CONNECT ACROSS POTS HERE IS THE FIRST ONE WAS IN THE M. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SECTION OF PAGE SIX TWO. AND IT WOULD BE TITLED IN THIS IS VERY WANT KIDS FEDERAL E. M. DASH THREE POINT ONE D.. AND AND AND THERE'S THERE'S A METHOD TO THAT LABELING BUT I'M IN THE. THE FIRST THING IT SAYS INCORPORATE CLIMATE CONSIDERATION DROUGHT AND EMERGENCY PLANNING IT'S A VERY GENERAL RECOMMENDATION THE NET THEN YOU'LL SEE THE WATER MARK NEXT TO IT. IN THE WATER SECTION OF THE PLANE YOU'LL SEE FOLLOW RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MATCH THAT. IN AN THOSE TOGETHER YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT'S BEING ON THE GROUND HAS EMERGED. THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WORK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND REALLY BUILDING UP LOCAL PLANS TO RESPOND TO THE. TO THE FLOOD RISKS THAT WE SEE NOT ONLY IN OUR MAJOR RIVER WAYS BUT ALSO IN THE URBAN WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE ARE MANY TIMES MUCH MORE UNPREDICTABLE. THE NEXT THE NEXT ONE HOPEFULLY AND. I HAVE SOME TIME PUBLIC HEALTH ON PAGE ONE OF FIVE. THE HIGH LEVEL THE HIGH LEVEL GOAL HERE IS TO ESTABLISH AN IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN ROBUST SURVEILLANCE MECHANISMS. SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IS REALLY. IS MAKING SURE YOU HAVE EYES ON THE POPULATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE CHANGES ARE IMPACTING OUR ARE THE PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT. YOU KNOW. THEY'RE ALL AROUND US AND. YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE SIGNALS ARE NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS SO. IN HERE WE IDENTIFY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO TO TO TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT A PUBLIC HEALTH THE ABILITY TO TRACK THESE IMPACT IS THAT GOING TO THE CONCERT MONITORING THEM. AND THEN THE LAST. I HAVE ONE MORE TRANSPORTATION BUT I THINK MIGHT HAVING SYSTEMS. LOG OF THE LAST ONE BECAUSE I. IN OCEANS IN CO STEM PAGE ONE SEVENTY TWO. THERE'S A WHOLE SUITE OF RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND. PLANNING AN ADAPTATION TO REDUCE HAZARDS TO INCREASE RESILIENCE OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER RESOURCES. WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME ARM. NOT ONLY IS THIS. NEAR THE ISSUES OF SEA LEVEL RISING COASTAL. COSTA RESILIENCY COULD I SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE ICONS NEXT TO THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU REALLY SEE HOW THOSE LINK TO POLICY AREAS THAT. YOU KNOW SEA LEVEL RISE IS OFTEN TALKED ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SUBCOMMITTEE THREE BUT SEA LEVEL RISE REALLY SHOULD BE TALKED ABOUT IN EVERY SUBCOMMITTEE AS IT AS IT IMPACTS THOSE. POLICY AREAS AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO AND IT'S BETTER ONLINE WE YOU KNOW WE WE TRIED IT WE LINK THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS SO THE PUBLIC CAN. CONTRACT THAT AS A BECAUSE AROUND. SO THE LAST THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT WAS WE. WE DID ALL WE PUT A LOT OF THEM WORK AND REALLY REALLY IN IT WITH SUPPORT FROM OUR OUR. OUR PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS ON THIS REPORT. INTO. ENSURING THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS EVERY POLICY AREA. YOU KNOW REALLY GET AT THE QUESTIONS OF EQUITY. A CLIMATE JUSTICE. AND. YOU KNOW THOSE THAT THOSE THAT ARE. CLEMENT JUSTICE TO ME YOU KNOW THE RELIGIOUS MEANS OF THAT THAT HIGH IN OF THOSE THAT HAVE THE HARDEST GO IN LIFE. REALLY ARE GONNA THE HARD AGO WHEN WHEN CLIMATE IMPACTS COME INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU BUILD UP TO SUPPORT SYSTEMS TO? TO MAKE SURE THAT THUMBED THEIR NEEDS ARE ADDRESSED BUT ALSO THAT THERE THEIR VOICES ARE CAPTURED IN THE PLANNING PROCESS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT POLICY AREAS OVER TIME. WE HAD. SO ONE PAGE THIRTY ONE. THE CLIMATE THIRTY PITCH THIRTY THIRTY ONE THE CLIMATE JUSTICE CHAPTER I'M IS THE PRODUCT OF EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION WITH THE. WITH THE CLIMATE JUSTICE WORKING GROUP HAS HAVE A LOT OF WORKING GROUP'S MAP BUT THE THE CLIMATE JUSTICE WORKING GROUP WHICH HAD. WHICH HAD PARTICIPANTS FROM FROM NGOS CROSS THE STATE IN THOSE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN SCHOLARSHIPS BY THE BY THE FOUNDATION COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. THEY PROVIDED. INCREDIBLE. INPUT TO OUR INITIAL DRAFT AND WE REALLY WORKED WITH THEM TO T MAKE SURE THAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SPREAD ACROSS. SO KIND OF WHAT COMES NEXT WITH THIS WE HAVE WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE WE HAVE WE WHERE WE'VE WE'VE. HUNDREDS OF AND ALMOST A THOUSAND OF ONGOING ACTIONS YOU KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT SO THERE. THERE'S GOING TO BE AN EFFORT THIS YEAR AND THIS ISN'T STATURE TO. TRACK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND I THINK THE CLOSEST THAT I CAN A LINE THAT TO RIGHT NOW IS IS THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT ON THE THAT THAT THE ABILITY OF DEPARTMENTS TO MEET. AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS SO WORRYING WORK WE'RE GOING DEEP INTO THAT THAT EXTREME DATA DIVE RIGHT NOW IF A FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRACK. EACH OF THESE AGENCIES AND HAVE THEM TRUCK THEMSELVES AS PART OF THAT SOCIALIZING THAT BUT TOOL TO GET THEM FOCUSED ON THESE ISSUES. I THINK WE'RE REALLY IN THE LEARNING PHASE RIGHT NOW OF HOW TO HOW TO TRACK PROGRESS SO. YOU KNOW THAT'LL BE THIS YEAR IN THE FUTURE WE MAY ONE AROUND THAT UP INTO SOMETHING MORE. MORE. GENERAL AND PROGRAMMATIC INFEASIBLE BUT. WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET. AND THEN LAST YOU KNOW. ULTIMATELY. I THINK WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS PLAN IS THE QUESTION OF HOW SHOULD IT BE USED. ALL WE DESIGNED THIS DOCUMENT SO THAT IT IT. IT REALLY IS MEANT TO BE TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABILITY TOOL ACROSS GOVERNMENT. AND IT SHOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR EVERYONE AND WHATEVER DAY TO DAY BUSINESS THAT THEY WORK ON IN THIS BUILDING AND AN ACROSS THE STATE ARE WE READY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE THAT THAT ISN'T JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE IT'S SOMETHING THAT MULTIPLIES CROSS TRANSPORTATION HEALTH. PARKS AND RECREATION CULTURE YOU KNOW EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK. AND THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW MY HOPE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY USE THIS AS A AS A CLIMATE LOANS AND WITH WITH WITH YOU ALL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BUDGETS. AS A POLICY LENDS WHEN WE WHEN WE WHEN WE DRAFT BILLS WE LOOK AT PROPOSED PROGRAMS. BUT ALSO IN OF THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THIS AS A AS A TOOL TO REALLY PUSH ON STATE GOVERNMENT. WHEN THEY SEE AREAS THAT WERE WERE QUITE FRANKLY LACKING HONOR THEY YOU KNOW. WHERE THEY SEE IMPROVEMENT IS NEEDED? AND THEN LAST IN IN THIS IS REALLY THIS IS REALLY. TAKING OFF IN A WE'RE IN THIS WERE IN THE STATE WIDE COLLECTIVE EFFORT RIGHT NOW TO FIGURE THIS OUT. THIS IS NOT THIS IS A DYNAMIC CHANGING NEW. AREA PLANNING WERE WERE CHASING IN A TREND LINES THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT COMPLETELY STABLE HONOR THEIR GOING UP AND DOWN. WE HOPE THAT THIS PLAN REALLY SERVES AS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER STATES WE HOPE THAT. THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS AMUSES AS A MODEL FOR THEIR OWN PLANNING EFFORTS. BUT THEN YOU KNOW. THE ONLY WAY THAT'S REALLY WORKS AS A PHASES OF THE MODEL LEARN FROM US AND THEN DO A BETTER THEMSELVES. AND WE CAN COME BACK IN THREE YEARS WE'RE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO IMPROVE THIS AND LEARN OFF AT THEIR WORK SO WE HAVE VERY STRONG COLLABORATIVE'S WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AROUND. ON THIS PLAN AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN AND THE WAY THAT. WE'RE WE'RE SETTING UP OUR SYSTEMS AS WELL HAVE THAT WILL HAVE THAT THAT FEEDBACK LOOP SO THAT THE NEXT TIME WE COME. TO DRAFT THIS DOCUMENT WE WILL HAVE LEARNED QUITE A BIT. SO. THE LAST THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THAT THIS PLAN. YOU KNOW FOCUSES JUST ON WHAT STATE GOVERNMENT IS DOING. THEM. IT IS IN A STATEMENT OF WHERE WE ARE IN CLIMATE CHANGE WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. THIS SUMMER AND FALL THE STATE WILL BE RELEASING OVER FIFTY STUDIES THAT ARE GONNA BE DONE BY INSTINCT EIGHT RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS FROM THE UC SYSTEM THE STATE SYSTEM TO STANFORD PRIVATE. WE ARE GOING TO CONSOLIDATE THAT INFORMATION AND REALLY PROVIDE A FINDS GRAIN SCALE. ASSESSMENT OF WHAT. STATES. CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IN THE IN THE IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO. THAT PARTNER WITH THESE PLANNING TOOLS REALLY SAID. SENATE SENATE IN IT AND HOPEFULLY IN A GOOD DIRECTION. FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN THAT WE WILL JUST NEED TO REVISIT THEM SO. WITH THAT ALL AND COME OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU BEFORE WE BEGIN LET THE TAPE ROLL TANG HERE ALLEN ARAMBULA HERE BLOOM. COOPER THEIR MCCARTY OBERNOLTE HERE PATTERSON WEBER. THANK YOU THOUGHT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISTER BRECHT. MR WOULD NOT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I. WAS READING IN THE WATER SECTION OF THE REPORT. AND. ONE OF THE THINGS CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IS. THAT. PROPOSITION ONE ALLOCATED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENT LARGE WATER STORAGE PROJECTS AND OTHER SECTION. WAS READING IN THE NEXT STEPS ABOUT. DEVELOPING SUBSTANTIVE WATER STORAGE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND I WONDERED WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO THAT WAS GOING TO BE AND WHETHER NOT INCLUDED. ABOVE GROUND WATER STORAGE PROJECTS. SO SO THE WATER STORAGE. RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY ARE OUR FOCUS IT STATEWIDE IN THEY THEY ABSOLUTELY NAM. INCLUDE. ABOVE GROUND STORAGE AND THEN YOU KNOW CONDUCTIVE BELOW GROUND STORAGE WHERE THOSE SYSTEMS MAKES SENSE. THIS DOCUMENT DOESN'T GET INTO THE POLICIES OF HOW THOSE TO HAVE YOU KNOW. THAT LEADS TO THE WATER OF THAT THE PROCESS IS IN PLACE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON STORAGE BUT IT'S A IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO FLAG. THE IMPORTANCE OF OF HAVING THOSE INSURANCE MECHANISMS IN THE WATER SUPPLIES YOU GIVE MAXIMIZE OUR WATER MANAGEMENT OPTIONS. SO YES IT DOES AND. AND THEN THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THOSE AGENCIES ON DEVELOPING A. ALRIGHT PANDA ANOTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD WAS ARE A REPRESENT A VERY RURAL AREA OF THE STATE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FOR INSTANCE MARTIN LUTHER SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT. FOR STANDING AND. THE REDUCTION OF THE POTENTIAL FOR CATASTROPHIC FIRE. A BECAUSE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE BAD FOR THE CLIMATE AND BAD FOR CALIFORNIA. BUT I'M CONCERNED WHEN I READ THE FOREST THINNING SECTION IT SAID THAT WE HAVE TO PURSUE SOME THINNING BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY ADDRESS THE STATE'S. LACK OF CAPACITY FOR PROCESSING THOSE THINNING PRODUCTS IN A WAY THAT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAD A PLAN FOR HOW TO INCREASE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO DO THOSE. FACT WE DO HAVE A PLAN I'M IN ITS IN ITS SHOULD BE RELEASED SHORTLY BUT WHERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING. WITH. ACROSS MANY AGENCIES STATE AND FEDERAL AND DO SOME PUBLIC ON THE FORCE CARBON PLAN. SPACE DEDICATED TO TO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE MATERIAL. YOU KNOW FOR BOTH OF THE BIOMASS SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE WOOD PRODUCTS SIDE WE ALSO WERE DIRECTED BY S. B. EIGHT FIFTY NINE IN THE TRAILER BILL TO. PUT TOGETHER THE WOOD PRODUCTS WORKING GROUP WHICH WHICH DELIVERED RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE BEGINNING THE AIR AND THAT. THAT WORKING GROUP WAS REALLY TARGETED THAT. THE NON ENERGY SIDE OF THE OF THE MATERIAL QUESTIONS HOW DO YOU HAVE DO YOU STIMULATE MARKETS FOR THE USE OF THIS MATERIAL WHEN YOU ENGAGE IN THAT THAT RAMP UP OF THINNING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. THAT THE MATERIALS THAT ARE THAT ARE CLEARED IN THE THINNING PROJECT ARE URNT IN OPEN PILES. ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART IN THE FIELD SO HOW DO WE HAD WE HAD TO USE THE THROUGH MASS TIMBER YOU KNOW STE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WOOD PRODUCTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN. THERE MANY BENEFITS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MARKET WALK LOOK PAULA FORD READING ABOUT THAT AND I CAN GET HER TO THE TOP YOU HAVE BOTH SO FAR. IT IS IN PARTICULAR I'M CONCERNED ABOUT LEAKAGE BECAUSE WHEN WE TAKE THAT THOSE WOOD PRODUCTS AND WE TO SHIP THEM OFF TO CHINA OR WHEREVER THEY GO. AYE IF IF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE USED AND MARVELING UNFRIENDLY WAY IN OTHER PLACES IT REALLY DOESN'T DO LOSS IS A GLOBAL CLIMATE ANY GOOD AT ALL NEW. ART THANK YOU VERY. JUST SORT ECHO MY. VICE CHAIR SEGMENTS OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS BEEN OUR. MAJOR ISSUE ESPECIALLY THIS FALL AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE FOUND. INVESTED SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS INTO A FOUR STRING THE CAP AND TRADE BUDGET BUT ALSO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. I THINK WHAT SORT OF HAMPERED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT WAS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TREES EVEN AFTER. WE CAN DO ANYTHING OR ANY CUTTINGS OUT OF MISTER BLOOM WHEN YOU ARE JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING SIGNIFICANT TIME ON THE ISLAND. SUBCOMMITTEE THREE THIS YEAR. MR CLINTON AREA YOUR YOUR ME MISTER BLISS VERY GOOD FRIENDS. THAT'S ALL I HEARD. ARMED. BUT KNOW THAT BUT THANK YOU I I KNOW I AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WE TOUGH WE WANT TO. HARM. FIND A PATH TOGETHER OUGHT TO WORK TO WORK TOGETHER ON. OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MISTER CHAIRPERSON HOW DOES IT ECHO MISTER OBERNOLTE COMMENTS ON THE WATER STORAGE OBVIOUS THAT REPRESENT PART OF DELTA. AND. THE PUB ONE BEING FUNDS ARE ARE BOTH PUT PATH BEFORE I CAME HERE. SO IN THE STILL NOT BEING BUILT IN TALKING TO MEMBERS I TALKED AGENCY. IT'S STILL A PRIORITY SO HERE WE ARE AND WILL BE GONE BUT TIME EVEN GET STARTED. SO THAT THAT'S THE BIG CONCERN AND IT'S NEWER AND GENDER DROUGHT THIS YEAR THE WAY IT LOOKS IF WAY THINGS ARE GOING RIGHT NOW. SO. AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO. IS GONNA HAPPEN AS A PRIORITY OR IS NOT LETTING THE VOTERS SPOKE WHEN THEY PASSED THE BOND. AND IT'S TIME TO GET GOING SO THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S A CONCERN I HAVE IS DO A LOT OF MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT. THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I THINK. THANK YOU MUST COOPER. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OVERVIEW AND FOR THE REPORT I'M SURE WILL BE COMING BACK TO YOU AS WE HAVE A. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND IN THE BACK AND OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO A WEBSITE AS WELL BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. OUR NEXT ITEM IS A UPDATE ON THIS MISSION BASED BUDGETING WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS BILL DOES YES HELLO FREE TO BEGIN. RG BASIS WITHOUT THE RESEARCH ANALYSIS UNIT. AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. MYSELF ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE JC THOMPSON WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. ARE LEADING THE MISSION BASED REVIEWS. OF A NUMBER OF. DEPARTMENTS. YOU HAVE TWO HANDOUTS. THEY'RE GOING AROUND ONE IS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE IT JUST SHOWS A LIST OF THE. CURRENT PROJECTS AND THEN THE ONES WE HAVE SLATED. TO START. IN THAT IT'S RIP UP COMING UP BUDGET CYCLES. AND THEN THE SECOND DOCUMENT IS SOMETHING NEW IS. LIST OF OUR CURRENT PROJECTS AND SORT OF GIVING YOU A STATUS UPDATE. ON WHERE WERE OUT WITH THOSE INSERTED SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN AND NOW I'M OUT ANNA. COMPLETION DATE THAT WERE HOPING TO HIT. SO SINCE WE MET LAST AND WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THOSE FIRST FOR. THAT WE HAVE. AND UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW REAL ESTATE SERVICES DIVISION STATE HOSPITALS STATE FIRE MARSHAL. AND DEPARTMENT REHABILITATION. WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT ON TWO BIG RESEARCH SORT OF ON STAGES THE FIRST ONE IS JUST REALLY GETTING IN THERE AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING. VERY SORT OF. THOROUGHLY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO. ON THAT SORT OF HOW THEY GO ABOUT DOING IT. SOME HAVE SORT OF MADE STRIDES IN MODERNIZING THE WAY THEY FEEL THEIR REQUIREMENTS OTHERS HAVEN'T. AND THEN JUST SORT OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING SORT OF FROM THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND PEOPLE RUNNING THESE DEPARTMENTS WHAT. WHAT THEY'RE CHALLENGES ARE WITH THEIR STRUGGLES ARE AND SORT OF A THAT TAKES A REALLY LONG TIME ESPECIALLY WITH THE REALLY BIG AND I'M COMPLEX APARTMENT COME SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS? ON THE NEXT. SERVE AS AFTER WE'VE SORT OF COMPLETE ABOUT FACE BECOME UP A LIST OF ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO TACKLING WANNA FIND ANSWERS TO AND WE WANNA RESULT BASICALLY PROBLEMS THAT WE WANT TO SOLVE. ON THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW WITH THOSE FIRST FLOORS WERE BASICALLYHAVE THIS LIST OF OF ISSUES AND PROBLEMS WE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IN. AND. OR DEVELOPING CERTIFIABLY SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE ANNOUNCED. LOOKING WHAT WHETHER STATES ARE DOING LUTE TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS SOUND TAKING A DEEP DIVE INTO THE DATA. SET TO CONFIGURE WHAT THAT RIGHT ON FIXES FOR THESE. I'M WE ALSO PICKED UP TO ADDITIONAL ON REVIEW SINCE WE MET LAST ON TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL OUR SOULS FRIEDMAN NESTLE INITIAL RESEARCH ON PHASES ON THOSE TWO. SO WITH THAT I'M SEVENTIES AND IN TERMS OF SORT OF TARGET COMPLETION. ON SOME OF THESE BIGGER ONES LIKE STATE HOSPITALS YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO SORT OF SEE TANGIBLE PRODUCTS IN KIND OF A FLOW BASIS RIGHT THIS THIS SPELL WE WORKED REALLY CLOSELY. WITH OUR BUDGET COUNTERPARTS TO REALLY IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF ON THE BUDGET STRUCTURE FOR STATE HOSPITALS THE BUDGET ESTIMATE BINDER. AND THEN ALSO ON THE SALARIES AND WAGES GALLEON WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY INTO THAT DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR. FOR ELLIE O. COUNTERPARTS. BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TACKLE SOME SOME BIG THINGS THEY WORK ON SOME STOPPING STUDIES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS ARE GOING TO BE TACKLING THOSE IN THE NEXT. FEW MONTHS SO SO THAT'S REALLY GONNA ONE IT'S GOING TO GO ON FOR AWHILE AND WE'RE GONNA SORT OF HAVE TANGIBLE TO LIBERAL DELIVERABLES THAT'S WE GO. OVER ALL I CAN SAY THAT WE'VE HAD REALLY GREAT CLARA COLLABORATIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR IT DEPARTMENT COUNTERPARTS. AND I THINK THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND SORT OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FOR THE DEPARTMENTS ARE GONNA CONTINUE TO SORT OF SERVE FINANCE AND SERVE THE STATE. FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. AND I THINK THAT'S SO THAT'S IT AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON. THE ANSWER THEM. MR OVERLOADED. SO FAR NO SURPRISE I'M A BIG. BELIEVER IN THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. AND. OF IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING TO SEE THE WORK PROGRESS. SO WHO I JUST WANTED ASSN THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW SLASH HAND SO I MEAN FIRST OF ALL IN THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. IN THE YEAR SINCE WE LAST HAD AN UPDATE. OF WHAT PART OF YOUR WORK PRODUCTS DO YOU THINK WE CAN INCORPORATE INTO THE CURRENT BUDGET THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING. AND SO WE HAVE DONE. WORK WITH DEPARTMENTS IN HOSTELS AND WAS ACTUALLY CLUED IN THE IN THE IN THE BUDGET FOR THE NRA GUNNERY BUDGET RIGHT SO. SO THERE IS NOT SERVE A LONG STANDING ISSUE IN THE SALARIES AND WE JUST GOT IT RESOLVED WE ACTUALLY WANT CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT DOCUMENT AND SORT OF IMPROVE THE TRANSFERRING THAT ARGUMENT WE. CHANGE THE BUDGET STRUCTURE OF DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS TO IS FOR TO PROVIDE. A BETTER DISPLAY TO SEE CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT EACH HOSPITALS KIND OF EXPENSES WERE. AND THEN WE'VE ALSO. THE ESTIMATE BINDER IS NOW A LOT BETTER PROJECT THAN IT WAS. IN TERMS OF JUST LATE A LAY PERSON BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT STATE HOSPITALS DOZEN SORT OF WHAT SOME OF THAT JARGON THAT THEY'VE COMMONLY USED ACTUALLY MEANS I THINK IT'S THAT MORE ACCESSIBLE DOCUMENT. SO. YOU KNOW THE FUTURE OF LITERATURE LOW HANGING FRUIT THINGS FOR US BUT THEY'RE REALLY I THINK HELPED A LOT IN TERMS OF. HAVING A YOU KNOW THE LA O. IN AND YOU AND AND YOUR CONSULTANTS HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SORT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE TERM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITAL. SO. I'M HOPING THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL THINGS IN THE SPRING BUT I CAN'T SAY. YOU KNOW I CAN'T I'D YOU KNOW WORST THEIR SOLO WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE HAVEN'T LANDED ON ANY OF THEM YET SO. IN TERMS OF THIS BUDGET CYCLE I'M HOPEFUL. BUT. AND WE HAVE A PLAN THAT GETS. SO MOVING FORWARD IS HOW CAN HOW HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR WORK PRODUCT FITTING INTO. OUR RESPONSIBILITY OF BUDGET OVERSIGHT DO YOU SEE THEM THE BEING YEAR YOUR WORK PRODUCT GETTING INCORPORATED INTO THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISE. OR DO YOU SEE YOURSELF CONTINUING TO GIVE THESE KIND OF UPDATES TO OUR BUDGET OVERSIGHT OR IS THERE COME A TIME AT WHICH. ARE WE SHIFT TO THE OTHER BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AND YOUR WORK PRODUCT GETS INCORPORATED AS THEY CONSIDER DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BUDGET WHAT WHAT HE CENTER PROBABLY BOTH RELEASED A PARTLY BOTH AYE I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY BE GOING TO BE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT THAT COME OUT OF THESE IT. IS SHIFTING RESOURCES CHANGE IN FUNDING STRUCTURE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND NOT WILL YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT HERE BUT I WILL DEFINITELY MOVE THROUGH THE REGULAR. SUBCOMMITTEE BUDGET PROCESS AND THERE CAN BE OTHER THINGS THAT WE SORT OF FINE AND WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT MAYBE DON'T HAVE A BUDGET ACCESS THAN THAT WE'RE GONNA WANT TO TALK TO YOU AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE FOUND THIS IS INTERESTING AND. AND IT IS WHAT WE THINK. SO IT'S IT'S KIND OF BOTH. RIGHT THAT'S ENCOURAGING THANK YOU YEAH. THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS. A I WAS AN* BUT THE STATE HOSPITAL YEAH I KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN. THERE'S THERE'S BEEN AUDITS DEBATE ONGOING ISSUES. DOCTOR WEBER STRUGGLING ARM AYE HOW HOW WAS YOUR WORK HELPFUL AND SORT OF. LOOKING AT THOSE ISSUES SALE AND WAS IT OR WAS IT HELPFUL TO KNOW THIS IS YEAH YOUR KIND OF BUILDING A BUDGET FROM SCRATCH AND MONITOR LOOKING AT PURELY. YOUR PERFORMANCE ISSUES BUT THAT'S BEEN SORT OF AN ON GOING YEAH I MEAN ONE OF THINGS I WANNA SAY ABOUT SAVE HOSPITALS AND I'M IN SORT OF SHARING WITH OUR FOLKS AT FINANCED HIS THAT THEY. REALLY ACTUALLY COME A LONG WAY AND THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK SINCE THEY WERE KIND OF CARVED OUT A DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY HAVE. ON DON ARE READY TO SORT OF IMPROVE OPERATIONS AND. IT'S SORT OF IMPROVE THE. CONSISTENCY OF OPERATIONS PROSTATE HUSTLERS DEAFENING A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THOSE SAME HOSPITALS KIND OF HAVE BEEN DOING THIS KIND OF THINGS ON THEIR OWN FOR AWHILE YOU KNOW AND THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF WORK YET TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF SORT OF. HAVING IT BE MORE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE POSSIBLE THAT'S ONE OF THINGS ARE REALLY WORKING ON THEM WITH. ON AND A LOT OF IT IS THEY'VE REALLY DONE A LOT OF WORK SO A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS GETTING UP TO SPEED ON STUFF THEY'VE ALREADY DONE AND STUFF THAT THEY'RE ALREADY SORT OF HOPING TO ACHIEVE. AND THAT'S BEEN REALLY ENCOURAGING AND IT'S AND IT'S PROVIDED FOR VARIOUS WITH COLLABORATIVE ON AND GREAT RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF. MAKING PROGRESS NOT REVEAL WHAT AND IN THE MID TO ASK AS WE WE KNOW THE MENTAL HEALTH IS. I HUGE ISSUE WHETHER HOLES AROUND THE CORRECTIONS ISSUE AROUND THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE IT'S. AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT. ARM THERE AREN'T WAS OBVIOUS THE ANSWERS RIGHT AND THEY'RE BEEN CHALLENGES IN THE PAST IN THIS THIS IS AN AGENCY THAT HAS PRESENTED SOME OF THOSE SO. ARM. GOOD IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT THERE COULD BE IMPROVEMENT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO LOOK AT PLAN B. BUT COULD JUST SUPPORT. PLAN A PROM AND SO AS THAT INFORMATION COME TO THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL TO. BEGIN WITH GIVING IT TO THE COMMITTEE GIVING IT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEES ARMS THAT WE CAN SORT OF DRILLING BECAUSE. I'M WE WITH HER THE LAUNDRY LIST OF COMPLAINTS RIGHT BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN AN OBVIOUS PLACE TO GO WITH RIGHT DON'T WE BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE TO NECESSARILY GO. RIGHT AHEAD MONEY TO OPEN UP NEW HOSPITALS ARE NEW SYSTEM SO ON BUT IT BUT IT'S A HUGE A HUGE ISSUE AND AND MAJOR AREAS THAT ARE OFF. PUBLIC CONCERN RIGHT AND SO ON I MEAN I'VE IT'S GOOD IT'S ACTUALLY VERY REASSURING. TO HEAR ABOUT THE PROGRESS AND I'M GLAD THAT THEY'VE BEEN COOPERATING SO THAT IT MAKES. ON ME WANT TO CONTINUE TO WALK DOWN THIS PATH THEY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK BECAUSE. THAT THE HOPE IS OBVIOUSLY IF WE CAN. YOU TO THAT THE PROF AT THE PROCESS FOR LEARNING. RIGHT NOT OTHER AGENCIES YOU KNOW IT MAY BE CHORUS SIMILAR STRAITS COULD BUT ALSO LOOK AT IT IN IRAQ LA DOT ORG BUT OUR HOPE IS NOT. A AGAIN WHEN WE ALL MET PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF AGO. THAT THE PROCESS WAS NEVER DESIGNED AS PUNITIVE IS REALLY TRYING TO ON FIGURE HOW TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE RIGHT WITHOUT HOW HARD WE GET OPTIMAL. PERFORMANCE AROUND IT AND AND REALLY HOW DO WE HAVE ON IN A PUSHED AND NOT JUST IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS THAT REALLY GRAYSON AND AND FIND SOLUTIONS SIERRA WHO I KNOW THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE GOING TO TAKE TIME. RIGHT ON THE FTA FIXES CRITIC TOM IS NOT SOMETHING THE WAVE A MAGIC WAND AND A STOP. I'M. SO THEY JUST JOHN JUMPING TO THAT TO THE NEW PROJECT DEPICT PURCHASE TOXIC ADMINISTRATION OBVIOUSLY YEAH I APPRECIATE THE HELP ARM. WITH THAT THE SOURCE OLD SLASH NEW AGENCY ON WHICH JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF OBSERVATIONS ARE HIGHLIGHTS OF HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING FOR THE FIRST TAKE A SIX MONTH YEAH SO I CAN HAPPILY CAN GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL I WAS IN THE LEAD ON THAT. ONE SO BUT I CAN KIND OF GIVE YOU SOME OF THE INSIGHTS WE'VE HAD ON THAT ONE. I'M SORT OF THAT THE STRUCTURE THAT WAS INHERITED FROM VIA WE MAY NOT BE OPTIMAL. AND SORT OF SORT OF HOW TO THEIR DIVIDING THEIR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ON SO IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE MEAN MAY NEED TO BE SOME REDISTRIBUTION THEIR OF SORT OF SOME OTHER TASKS AND DUTIES AND WORKLOAD. AND THEN. ALSO THERE'S I THINK. HOW THEY SORT OF IN FORCE ON COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OFFICES NEEDS TO BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD WERE SO IT SEEMS SORT OF SOME SOME CONCERN THERE MAY BE SOME DISPARITIES AMONG FIELD OFFICES IS ANOTHER? SORT OF PLACE WERE SORT OF. HOPING TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE. IN THAT PARTICULAR SHE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR GUIDANCE BECAUSE STARTING. THERE WERE QUESTIONS I THINK WAS OF THREE YEARS AGO MAYBE TWO YEARS AGO WHICH ARE LOOKING AT THE. FROM PROLIFERATION OF FIELD OFFICES. DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND FUNNY ROLE THEY SERVE RIGHT HOME MUCH OF THE MATERIAL WAS UNLIKE PEOPLE WOULD WALK IN WITH MATERIAL OR QUESTIONS WRITTEN. SO WE WE WOULD WE COULDN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHY. THE AGENCY WAS OPENING UP MORE AND MORE RIGHT. OUT FIELD OFFICES AND AND REALLY WHAT THE EMPLOYEES IN THOSE OFFICES WYLER WERE DOING. RIGHT SO THAT THAT WAS DEATHLY A POINT OF. HOME. NOT AS A POINT OF CONCERN SO WITH INITIATE YOU OWN TAKING A. TAPPER LOOK AT THAT PURPOSELY. GREAT. OTHER QUESTIONS. NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE UPDATE THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE ARMED. BUDGET FUNDING ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS REALLY THINKER. DIRECTOR MET CAO FOR COMING TODAY. AS WELL AS LA OVER AND POUND FINANCE. IT AND DONE. REALLY THIS ARE DID DID THIS HEARING CAME ABOUT. BECAUSE WE HAD ARE A QUESTION OF FACT VERY INNOCENT QUESTION BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. ASKING. HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE SPENDING ON HOMELESSNESS AND? IT TOOK US FOUR WEEKS TO SORT OF FIGURE IT OUT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE COMPLETELY FIGURED OUT. THAT YOU HAVE MADE ME MORE NERVOUS. BUT WE REALLY WANTED TO SORT OF HEAR FROM FROM THE AGENCY AND ALSO HEAR FROM PART OF FINANCE. SERVED YOUR VIEWPOINTS ON ON WHERE STATE EXPENDITURES ARE GOING IN TERMS OF. A HOMELESSNESS OBVIOUSLY DID WANT TO GET AN UPDATE ON THE. WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME ISSUE I KNOW THAT THERE IS I'M A LAWSUIT GOING ON A JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN WHEN OR IF THERE MAY BE ANY KIND OF RESOLUTION COMING DOWN THE PIKE? ON THAT AND OBVIOUSLY THERE THERE'S BEEN ARM MAJOR CALLS BY A NUMBER OF MEMBERS NUMBER CITIES I'M I'M WORKING WITH. A NUMBER OF MAYORS ASKING FOR A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION AROUND HOMELESSNESS. SO. IT IT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO DO ANY KIND OF PUBLICATION ONE UNDERSTAND WHERE WHERE OUR MONEY IS TODAY. HOW IT'S BEING SPENT AND ARM WHERE SHOULD PIECE? WHERE ANY NEW MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT ARE MOVING DOWN THE ROAD SO? A WITH ACTOR VERY MUCH APPRECIATE OF BERTRAM ACCOUNT FOR FOR YOU BEING HERE AND. FLOOR SOURCE. THANK YOU SUCH ENTERTAINING AND AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I PACKER DEEPLY ABOUT AND IT'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME WITH MY STAFF AT EACH CD. WORKING ON BUT LET ME JUST. START BY OFFERING WILL THE CONTEXT ON ON WHERE THINGS ARE ON HOMELESSNESS FRONT. IN THEM AND GET SOME OF THE BUDGET DETAILS. BUT. YEAH OBVIOUSLY MANY OF YOU PASSED BY FOLKS. ON THE STREET. YOU SEE. TEMPORARY SHELTERS ARE. HOMELESSNESS AS A TERM AT ACTION COMPASS IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST FOLKS WHO LIVE ON THE STREET INCLUDES FOLKS WHO MAY BE LIVING IN SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS. INTO TEMPORARILY HOUSE IN SHELTERS AND OTHER OTHERWISE. EVERY YEAR. A THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT RELEASES ITS ANNUAL ASSESSMENT REPORT TO CONGRESS. AND THIS REPORT INCLUDES A POINT TIME ASSESSMENT THAT TRIES. TO ARTICULATE THE FULL SCOPE AND BREADTH OF THE HOME OF THIS CRISIS DOUBTS THE METROPOLITAN LEVEL. BUT WITHIN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. CALIFORNIA'S COUNT WHICH I ACCEPT THIS BETTER THAN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I WAS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEM. OF. PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERS AND PARTLY BECAUSE WHAT TOPPING CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY DIFFERENT THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING BY AND LARGE IN THE REST THE COUNTRY. WHERE AS MUCH THE COUNTRY IS ACTUALLY MAKING MEANINGFUL PROGRESS ON LAURIE HOLMES COUNTS? I CALIFORNIA'S POINT TIME COUNTS ARE GOING UP AND OTHER GOING UP SIGNIFICANTLY SIXTEEN PERCENT STATEWIDE TERMS THE TOTAL NUMBER. OF HOMELESSNESS. WHERE THE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HOMELESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IN THE STATE? AND. WHILE THIS IS A STATE WIDE PHENOMENON JUST ABOUT EVERY AREA CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE THIS UPTICK. WE DO SEE SOME AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPACTED OUR ALAMEDA COUNTY WENT UP BY. A THIRTY NINE PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR LA COUNTY WENT UP BY TWENTY THREE PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR. AND SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON HOW DO WE GET HERE. AND I I I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO SORT OF START BY SAYING YOU KNOW THERE IS A COURT CHALLENGE HERE WHICH WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT I'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND IN THE PAST WHICH IS. A CALIFORNIA IS SYSTEMATICALLY CHRONICALLY UNDER BUILDING HOMES AND HAS BEENFOR A PERIOD OF MULTIPLE DECADES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE AND THE MULTI FAMILY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AREA. ARE WE'VE AVERAGED STATEWIDE ONLY ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW HOMES PER YEAR OVER THE LAST COUPLE DECADES. BUT LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT BY THE STATE HAD PROJECTED WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO BE BE BUILDING TO KEEP PACE. AND. IN THE LOWER INCOME PORTION. OUR DATA THAT WE RECEIVED FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES EVERY YEAR THROUGH OUR ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS THIS PARTICULAR TROUBLING. IN THIS CURRENT REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION CYCLE BUT WE HAVE ONLY PRODUCED SEVEN PERCENT. OF WHAT WE KNEW WE NEEDED IN THE LOWER INCOME AREA. AND TODAY A NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF TRIPS DICKENS ALL BUT A HANDFUL. ARE BEHIND PIECE IN TERMS OF DELIVERING ON THAT LOWER INCOME SEGMENT. MORE TROUBLING AS WELL AS THAT THE A WHERE WE ARE SEEING THAT HOUSING GETTING PRODUCED. IS NOT. CONSISTENTLY IT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY OF FARTHER AWAY FROM JOBS IT IS FARTHER AWAY FROM AMENITIES IT IS FARTHER AWAY FROM TRANSIT. AND SO WE ARE PUTTING A FURTHER BURDEN. WHEN WE ARE BUILDING HOMES AND FOLKS TALKED BY THOSE HOUSES BECAUSE OF A CONTINUED DEPENDENCE ON CARS AND LONG COMMUTES. A DIFFICULT ACCESS THE RESOURCES AMENITIES IN JOBS THEY NEED TO BE STABLE AND THE STATE HOUSE. BOB THAT FACTOR HAS. IS MUCH THE REASON WHY THE UNITED CENSUS BUREAU LAST YEAR PLACE CALIFORNIA NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION. ARE FOR ITS POVERTY RATES ONCE COST OF LIVING IS FACTORED IN. AND THAT IS MUCH OF THE REASON WHY. TODAY CALIFORNIA ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ON INDIVIDUALS HOUSEHOLDS. ARE CAN BE ARE I HAVE WORST CASE HOUSING NEEDS WHICH IS A HUD TERM THAT CAPTURES LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING ANY KIND OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE OR SUPPORT. BETTER PAYING EVERY MONTH MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME. IN HOUSING COSTS THIS A DEMOGRAPHIC IS ONE THAT WE NEED TO BE WHAT WORRYING AND WATCHING VERY CAREFULLY. THERE'S GOOD RESEARCH OUT THERE THAT SHOWS THAT THIS IS THE. BOB THIS THIS OF A BODY OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE ONES WHO ARE FALLING BEHIND ON TURN IT ON HEALTH CARE NOT SAVING FOR THE KIDS' EDUCATION. UP AND HEART USES THIS NUMBER AS A PROXY FOR. FOR HOMELESSNESS. I'M HERE CALIFORNIA THAT NUMBER IS UP BY ALMOST A THIRD FROM WHERE WE WERE A DECADE AGO. NOW PART OF THE STORY IS ALSO CLEARLY. ABOUT THE LACK OF SUBSIDY THAT HAS BEEN GOING OUT TO SUPPORT THIS POPULATION DIXIE BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. END UP IN A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT STORY. DOES ALSO THAT TIE INTO THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOT OVER THE LAST DECADE WE HAVE SEEN FEDERAL CUTS TO OUR QUIRK. A AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS COMING INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. THOSE CUTS HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED IMPACTED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. AS MANY MAY BE AWARE OF THE FEDERAL THAT REFORM FEATURE ONE THAT A CHANGE THE TAX CODE LAST DECEMBER. HAS HAD THE CONSEQUENCE OF SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE VALUE OF THE FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. COR PART OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT SUCH THAT FROM TAX REFORM WE ARE NOW GONNA BE SEEING AN ESTIMATED. OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF LAST PER YEAR IN INVESTMENT. ARE GOING INTO AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ANNUAL. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S ALL WE DO KNOW WHAT WORKS I THINK THERE IS A VERY STRONG BODY OF LITERATURE PRACTICE AROUND HOMELESSNESS. THAT GIVES US SOME SHOULD GIVE US SOME COURAGE AND HOPE. WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A NUMBER OF STATES SMALLER STATES ADMITTEDLY I'M AND CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THE MAYORS GOVERNORS GET OUT THERE DECLARE THAT THEY HAVE ATTAINED. WHAT'S CALLED FUNCTIONAL ZERO EITHER WITH A VETERAN HOMELESSNESS OR CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. IN FACT RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS ABLE TO HIT THAT MARKER. NOT THAT LONG AGO FOR FOR. A CHRONIC VETERANS HOMELESS SO WE WE REDUCE THE PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER. AND THAT THE USE OF CIGARETTES THE BUTTE INGREDIENTS TEND TO BE. NO CLEARLY NUMBER ONE TACKLING THIS WORST CASE HOUSING YOU POPULATION WE CANNOT SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IF WE CAN'T SOLVE THE LARGER ISSUE. AROUND. A RENT BURDEN FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. BUT SECONDLY A INVESTING IN WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS ACTUALLY WORKS FOR THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE A PRICKLY EPISODIC AND CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS A CONTINUUM OF CARE. WITH COORDINATED ENGAGEMENT BY THE FULL SPECTRUM OF PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT TOUCH ON HOMELESSNESS ISSUES. ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. UTILIZING BY NAME A DIRECTORIES THAT USE THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS TECH TO TRACK. INDIVIDUAL BY INDIVIDUAL. BUILDING OUT COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEMS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL THAT LINE UP. THE INDIVIDUALS MOST IN NEED A MOST VULNERABLE. WITH HOME SAYS WITH THE WITH THE HOUSING OF THE RESOURCES THAT BECOME AVAILABLE SO WE HAVE GOOD MATCHING. NOT RAPID RE HOUSING AND OTHER INVESTMENTS TO QUICKLY MOVE FOLKS WHO ARE ABOUT TO HIT HOMELESSNESS OR OF JUST TO HELP US IS QUICKLY BACK OFF THE STREETS. AND OF COURSE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH IS REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD HERE IN TERMS OF THE LONG TERM SALUTE BUILDING HOUSING. THAT PROVIDES AFFORDABILITY AND INTEGRATED SERVICES TO HELP FOLKS WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE COMBINATION OF MENTAL ILLNESS. A PHYSICAL IT INJURY A SUBSTANCE ADDICTION TO TACKLE. I'M NOT LEAVE TALK BECAUSE OF OUR PAST YOU'LL GO THROUGH THAT THE FULL LIST THAT THAT UP FINANCE FISK SO CABLE WE PUT FORWARD IN TERMS THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS ARE OUT THERE BLOODY FLAG A FEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT I THINK ARE WORTH. MATCHING THEM FIRST ON THE COORDINATION PIECE HAVE TO BE A BIG PIECE OF OUR SOLUTIONS. I AM VERY PLEASED REPORT. THAT THE STATE'S HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. WHICH WAS CREATED. OF S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY. IN THE PREVIOUS SESSION. HAS NOW BEEN FULLY CONSTITUTED WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD OUR SECOND MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE KEY STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS THAT TOUCH INTO HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADVOCATES. AND THAT BODY HAS BEGUN THIS FOR IMPORTANT WORK BOTH OF MAKING SURE THAT WERE PROMULGATING HOUSING FOR STANDARDS ACROSS ALL OF THE HOMELESSNESS RELATED PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE MINISTERS. ABOUT CATALOGING AND INVENTORYING OTHER PROGRAMS ARE WORKING. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO PRIORITIZE AREAS THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTER AGENCY STATEWIDE. ENGAGEMENT ON HOUSING. ON HOUSING ACTIVITIES. BUT THE DRUM HOUSING NEEDED ELEMENT. ALSO HAS BEEN. PUTTING OUT A NUMBER OF FUNDING FOR NUMBER TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT ARE WE THINK ARE KEY TOOK LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. WELL AS MUCH A COUPLE ONE IS ARE THE MERSEY SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS A ACTUALLY NEW PROGRAM THAT WAS LAUNCHED WITH INFUSION OF STATE. FUNDING OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THAT LEVERAGES FEDERAL FUNDS THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM. BACK SHE DELIVERS FUNDING TO EVERY CONTINUUM OF CARE EVERY LOCAL REGION IN THE STATE. ARE TO HELP THEM ACTUALLY WITH PRIORITIZING APPROACHES FROM. DOT AND COORDINATED ENTRY OF RAPID RE HOUSING EFFORTS. A BUILDING OUT THEIR OWN CAPACITY. WHEN OUR SECOND ROUND OF OF THAT PROGRAM RIGHT NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY PUTTING OUT THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF STATE. E. SG RESOURCES GAP PROGRAM FUNDING IN APRIL. BOB WE'RE ALSO IN OUR FOURTH ROUND NOW A FUNDING THROUGH OUR VETERANS HOUSING AND HOMELESS PREVENTION WHICH IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. PUTTING OUT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR BUILDING PERMITS PART OF HOUSING TO SERVE OUR OUR VETERANS. CHAIRMAN YOU MENTION THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THAT IS UNDERGOING A COURT VALIDATION PROCESS OF BEFORE WE CAN PROCEED WITH THAT. UP I CAN REPORT OUT THAT A HEARING DATE. FROM OF THE FROM THE ROLE THE LOWER COURT HAS NOW BEEN SET. UP FOR A JULY THE TWENTY THIRD. TO HAVE A TALK. MORE ABOUT THAT. A WE ALSO OR ARE PLEASED TO NOTE THAT WE WILL BE RELEASING A AND ANTICIPATED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OPPONENTS PART OF HOUSING THROUGH A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM. A LATER THIS YEAR THESE ARE ACTUALLY FUNDS OF COME BACK TO US A THROUGH A NUMBER OF LEGACY PROGRAMS WERE PLEASE TO PUT OUT. TOUGH FIFTH FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. PERMITS PORT PERMITS WERE HOUSING ABOUT. M. AND AGAIN I HAVE TO EMPHASIZE THE HOUSING PIECE OF IT IS JUST ONE COMPONENT. WE ARE ALSO CLEARLY SUPPORTED AND ALL THIS WORK BY THE GREAT WORK GOING ON BY OUR COLLEAGUES AT PLACES LIKE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES THEIR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT USING. FEDERAL MEDICAID WAIVERS TO DELIVER. A USED FEDERAL FUNDS ARE CREATIVE WAYS THAT LEVERAGE HOUSING RENTAL ASSISTANCE. HAS BEEN IN PLEDGING NOW TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. RUN THE STATE. OTHERS GREAT WORK OBVIOUSLY HAPPEN IN TERMS OF SERVICES REPRESENTED HERE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO COULD. LIKELY SPEAK TO THE TOWERS HOUSING PROGRAM THAT HELPS. ARE VERY VULNERABLE HOMELESS FAMILIES. THAT ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF HOMELESSNESS TO PREVENT A FICTION OR TO GET RE HOUSE PROMPTLY. I LOOK FORWARD OBVIOUSLY UP WITH HOUSING PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED A LATE LAST YEAR. WE HAVE SENATE BILL TWO WHICH PROVIDES A PERMANENT. A FUNDING SOURCE FOR HOUSING AND PRIORITIZES HALF OF THE FEES COLLECTED IN THE FIRST YEAR. OR AN ESTIMATED HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PURPOSES OF HOMELESSNESS. NOT MY STAFF HAS BEEN. ENGAGING ALREADY WITH A STAKEHOLDERS BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN USE THESE FUNDS. YOU PROBABLY OFFICIALS OFFICIALLY FILL SOME OF THE GAPS THAT ARE OUT THERE DEPLOY THROUGH SOME OF THESE SUCCESSFUL CHANNELS THAT HAVE ALREADY NOTED. HOW WE DO ANTICIPATE A ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS ALSO TO DO THE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS OF IDENTIFYING HOW TO PRIORITIZE THESE FUNDING? THOSE COLLECTIONS ARE OBVIOUS SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION. AND THE REVENUES WE WILL. BE AVAILABLE TO US WE GET A SPATE OF THE SOONEST US THIS FALL TO DO IT DURING THIS ROUND OF FUNDING THERE. WOULD LIKELY A FUTURE ROUND OF FUNDING. WITH FUNDS COLLECTED LATER HALF OF THE YEAR. COMING IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND THAT SENATE BILL THREE OF COURSE. PROVIDE FUNDING FOR NUMBER DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. AND IF ENACTED BY THE VOTERS A ONE OF THE PRIMARY PROGRAMS THERE'S ARE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM WHICH. WE WOULD EXPECT WOULD INCLUDE EIGHT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING COMPONENT THAT WOULD HELP US BUILD MORE OF THE PROMISE FOR PASSING THAT SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. SO. WITHOUT I'LL JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT I HAD THE HONOR NOT LONG AGO ABOUT GOING OUT AND SPEAKING AT A. GRAND OPENING FOR UP A PROPERTY IN A ORANGE COUNTY CALL POWDERS LANE. THAT WAS SERVING CHRONICALLY HOMELESS VETS. AND A REALLY BEAUTIFUL COMPLEX ACTUALLY USED. RECYCLED A STEEL SHIPPING CONTAINERS TO A VERY ELEGANT ARCHITECTURE ACTUALLY HOUSE FOLKS AND ACTUALLY BUILD THIS OUT BURGER RICK QUICKLY. AND I WAS INSPIRED BY THE SORT INNOVATION BUILDING MATERIALS ON THE CREATIVITY THAT WE'RE SEEING AMONG FOLKS RECEIVING OUR FUNDING. ENCOURAGED BY HOW QUICKLY THIS PROJECT WAS ABLE TO ACTUALLY GO FROM FUNDING ACTUALLY GETTING A PROPERLY STUFF I HAD A LONG CHAT WITH. ONE OF THE RESIDENTS. OMIT MANY JAMES WOOD SPENT LAST FEW YEARS LITTLE WHICH LIVING IN HIS CAR I'M UP A BY THE RIVER. DOG FIFTY. AND AND YOU KNOW HE CONVEYED TO ME HAS EXCITEMENT FINALLY FINDING A HOME IN A PLACE TO BE STABLE WAS EVER INFECTIOUS AMBER MOTIVATING BEFORE FOR ME SO. I'LL CLOSE BY JUST SAYING LOOK THESE ARE THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGES THAT I THINK ANY OF US TAKE ON IS TRY TO MAKE PROGRESS IN HOMES AREA. UP BUT I DO THINK. WITH CONTINUED NO POLITICAL WILL WITH A STRONG AND REGION'S COORDINATION OF ALLUDED TO. AND WITH SOME PATIENTS I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY THAT WERE. DO OR FROM THE LYMPHOMA COME. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO KIND OF BUILD OFF OF DOCUMENT CASTS. COMMENTS TO JUST GIVE YOU SOME CONSIDERATIONS IN THINKING ABOUT. BOTH ALMOST FUNDING IN THE CURRENT BUDGET AND POTENTIAL AUGMENTATIONS FOR DIS ON THE SERVICES GOING FORWARD. HI I WANTED START BY HIGHLIGHTING ONE PIECE OF THE WAS MENTIONED BY DIRECTOR MET CAPTAIN THAT IS THE. THE HALF OF THE FIRST YEAR FUNDING FROM S. B. TWO BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE. MILLION DOLLARS IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. SP TWO DIRECTED OF THAT PART OF FUNDING TO GO TO. PROVIDE SERVICES TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS GENERALLY OTHER WAS IN A LOT OF SPECIFIC DIRECTION IN S. B. TWO AND WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION IS IS. A PLANS AND IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE BEST USE OF THOSE FUNDS ABOUT OF COURSE WOULD SUGGEST. THAT YOU ALL A CONSIDER WHAT PRIORITIES YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR THOSE FUNDS. AND CONSIDER GIVING MORE SPECIFIC DIRECTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SEE THOSE FUNDS SPENT WHETHER IT BE FOR A ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION SUBSIDIES OR SERVICES. TO ATTACH TO PERMIT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ALMOST INDIVIDUALS OTHER A LOT OF A CHOICE IS THERE A FOR THIS PART OF MONEY. THAT YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER GIVING ADDITIONAL DIRECTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION. AGAIN ANOTHER SET OF CONSIDERATIONS. THAT THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER WITH. WITH ANY ADDITIONAL OF HOMES FUNDING ARE. A WHAT CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS MAY BE IN PLACE TO A GETTING THIS FUNDING OUT THE DOOR A TO LOCAL ENTITIES AND THEN. ULTIMATELY A CONSTRUCTING THE HOUSING IN AND BRING IT ON LINE. ONE UNDERLYING CONSIDERATION IS THE FACT THAT THAT ONLY A SUBSET OF BUILDERS AND NON PROFITS I DO A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN BILLS PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND STATE FUNDING IN PAST YEARS. HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT SPORADIC ó IT'S RELIED ON A ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS IN BOND FUNDS IN BECAUSE OF THIS. THE YOU KNOW THERE HASN'T BEEN QUITE INCENTIVE FOR A ROBUST. INSTITUTION OF NONPROFITS AND BUILDERS A SPECIALIZING IN THIS TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT. TO KIND OF TAKE HOLD IN THE STATE. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MANY OF THESE NONPROFITS ARE STARTING TO STAFF UP NOW AND AND RAMP UP IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE RECENT ALLEGATIONS IN THIS AREA. BUT SOME OF THAT WILL WILL TAKE TIME. AND SO THAT IS THAT IS ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS YOUR THINKING ABOUT. HOW QUICKLY THE CURRENT FUNDING IS MOVING OUT AND HOW QUICKLY ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAKE IT UP? A ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DOES REQUIRE A MORE SIGNIFICANT US SUBSIDIES ON A PER UNIT BASIS THAN A TYPICAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOES. ON THIS IS THIS IS A GENERALLY DO THE THE SIMPLE FACT THAT A HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TYPICALLY CAN PAY A LITTLE LITTLE OR NOTHING IN RENTS EVEN COMPARED TO. THE GENERAL LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THAT IS IN A GENERAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND LOOKING AT A LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CUT TRADED PROJECT DATA FROM THE LAST FEW YEARS. SHOWS OF THAT THAT THE TYPICAL STATE SUBSIDY NEEDED FOR A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNIT. WAS ABOUT TWICE THAT OF. JUST GENERAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND. THIS NEED FOR GREATER SUBSIDY CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS TO PENCIL OUT IN THAT CAN CONSTRAIN THE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE FOR. A DEVELOPERS TO BRING THESE KIND OF PROJECTS FORWARD AS COMPARED TO A JUST A TYPICAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. CITING A. THE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL A CONTINUES A TO BE SOMEWHAT OF A CHALLENGE AND IT AND IT DOES TAKE TIME. WE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE THIS AREA WITH A LEGISLATION LAST FOR YEARS TO ATTEMPT A TO STREAMLINE THESE LOCAL PROPHECIES AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO THESE PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT THE BUT THERE'D STILL REMAIN SOME REALITIES THAT THAT CREATE BARRIERS. AND CREATE TIME AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ONE KEY FACTOR IS A LANE LAND AVAILABILITY. OF MUCH OF THE HOMELESS PROBLEM IS CONCENTRATED OUR IN OUR DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS WHERE OF VACANT AND UNDER UTILIZED LAND IS VERY SCARCE. AND DEVELOPERS OF SPERM PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ARE COMPETING WITH OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING DEVELOPERS WITH COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS WITH ALL ALL A HOST OF OTHER KINDS OF A POTENTIAL USES FOR THAT SCARE SLOWING AND. AND THAT CAN CONSTRAIN THE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE FOR PROJECTS TO COME FORWARD IN A GIVEN YEAR. I'M POUNDED A BY A LOCAL ZONING RULES. THAT. CAN. ARE NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY ALIGNED WITH. WITH THE ECONOMIC REALITIES OF DEVELOPERS. WE FOUND FOR EXAMPLE THAT TWO THIRDS OF MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS AND LARGE CITIES AND LA IN THE BAY AREA. NEEDED ZONING CHANGES TO MOVE FORWARD IN RECENT YEARS. AND AGAIN WE THE LEGISLATURE HAS. BEFORE HIS A PASS SOME LEGISLATION TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. AND I THINK IT'S MADE SOME SOME BIG STEPS THERE OF BUT THIS IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN A SOMETHING OF AN ISSUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION. THAT HASN'T BEEN AN ISSUE TODAY BUT THAT COULD BECOME AN ISSUE IN FUTURE YEARS. IS THE AVAILABILITY OF. TAX CREDITS THROUGH THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AS DIRECTOR MET CALF MENTION. THE LONG COMMITTING TAX CREDIT IS KIND OF THE FOUNDATION OF ALMOST ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. A AND THIS THIS PROGRAM. HAS. TWO PARTS THERE'S THE THE NINE PERCENT CREDIT WHICH PROVIDES DAY. MORE SUBSTANTIAL SUBSIDY FOR AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT THERE'S THE FOUR PERCENT CREDIT. WHICH PROVIDE THE LESSER SUBSIDY BUT IS A PAIRED WITH TAX EXEMPT FINANCING THAT'S PROVIDED THROUGH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. AND BOTH SIDES OF OF THIS PROGRAM BOTH THE NINE PERCENT CREDIT. AND DETECTIVE GOT FINANCING OUR OUR. CAPT ANNUALLY BASED ON LIMITS A SET BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A RIGHT NOW THE NINEPERCENT CREDIT IS A IT IS COMPETITIVE IT'S OVER SUBSCRIBED. BUT ON THE FOUR PERCENT SIDE. THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH OF FUNDING TO GO AROUND FOR ALL THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD IN RECENT. BUT OTHER THERE IS THE POTENTIAL. IN THE COMING YEARS. THAT. IF NO PLACE LIKE HOME IN S. B. THREE DO COME ONLINE ASSUME. AND YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE S. B. TO FUNDING IN SOME OF THE LOCAL BOND MEASURES THAT HAVE PASSED. THAT ALL OF THAT FUNDING COMING ONLINE AT ONCE. IT'S LIKELY OR POSSIBLE OR LIKELY THAT EVEN THE FOUR PERCENT SIDE OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM COULD BECOME OVER SUBSCRIBED. THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE ALL THE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. OF BUT IT COULD MEAN YOU HAVE TO SPREAD OUT THOSE TAX CREDITS. MORE THINLY ACROSS A LARGER NUMBER OF PROJECTS WHICH WOULD THEN REQUIRE AS ESSENTIALLY A STATE TO FILL IN THE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY NEEDED FOR THOSE PROJECTS MAKING. THE KIND OF THE STATE'S COST FOR EACH UNIT. A MORE EXPENSIVE. THINK ABOUT WITH THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO TAKEN. TO ACCOUNT AND THINKING ABOUT HOMELESS FUNDING MOVING FORWARD AND HAVE IT ANSWERED QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU. GOING BACK TO YOUR EARLIER POINT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING FUNDS OUT THE DOOR. DID YOU ARM FIND ANY PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR THAT WERE MORE EFFECTIVE AT MOVING. MONEY FASTER NOW A DIRECT QUESTION ABOUT ALEJO AND DIRECTOR MATT CASH A OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO BE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH BUT. I WE DO HAVE A CRISIS AND WE DO NEED TO GET SHELTER UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF MOVING MONEY OUT MORE QUICKLY ONE OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS. IS. TRYING TO LEVERAGE. EXISTING PROGRAMS IN EXISTING REGULATIONS. THAT. WHETHER IT BE THROUGH EACH CITY OR THROUGH. THE THE STATE LONG COME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. THAT. ARE ALREADY IN PLACE TO NOT REQUIRE. EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS EASIER OR A REGULATORY PROCESSES FOR EACH CD TO START MOVING A THE FUNDING OUT THE DOOR. TRADITIONALLY. ANY CD OF THAT KIND OF WORK COURSE PROGRAM HAS BEEN THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM. AND THERE ARE. YOU KNOW POTENTIALS TO KIND OF HAVE SET ASIDE FOR THE TIME PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON PARTICULAR POPULATIONS LIKE A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND AND MAYBE THE DIRECTOR MIGHT HAVE. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. BUT NO I THINK I THINK IF YOU YOU KNOW THAT I THINK FOR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE A BUILDING ON WHAT WORKS INTERVIEW THE PROGRAM SO BACK IN THE PAST IS CONSISTENTLY THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN MOVE. DEFINING OUT THAT SAID WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING AND VACATION WHENEVER WE DO ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING WE DO A. DO SOME FINE TUNING SOME UPDATING AND WE WANTED TO DO THAT WITH THE S. B. THREE OF PROGRAMS AS WELL. HIT THE OTHER THING I JUST MENTION. IT IS ANOTHER SOMETIMES A TEMPTATION TO SAY. YOU KNOW WELL WE SHOULD PUT ALL THIS MONEY OUT. INTO. YOU KNOW BUT SHOT SHELTERING HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE WE CAN WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN MUCH MORE QUICKLY. UP AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW OF SHELTER NAVIGATION CENTERS HAVE AN IMPORTANT. PLACE IN THE SORT OF CONTINUUM OF OF CARE. ABOUT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THAT WE DON'T SEE. LONG TERM POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR SHELTER INTERVENTIONS IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY MOVING FOLKS. IN ISOLATION OUT OF HOMELESSNESS AND INTO STABILITY BUT RAPID RE HOUSING IS OF A VERY PROMINENT PART OF OUR TOOL KIT ITS IMAGE WE WE WE SUPPORT A THERMOS WASN'T SCRAP PROGRAM. THAT WE BELIEVE IT'S A MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND TO HUMANE OPTION BUT COMPARED TO THE SHELTER SYSTEM. I'M AND YET SORT OF THE THE DEFINITIVE HUD STUDY ALL ON THIS MATTER DID NOT FIND THE RAPIDLY HOUSING ACTUALLY HAD BETTER OUTCOMES THAT THE CHILD SHOULD SIMPLY MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DISSOLVE PROBLEM. THE YET LOOK LIKE OF THE US SOLUTION THAT REALLY IS WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FOR THE CHRONICLE MOST HAS TO BE PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ON THE SOLUTION THAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON FOR THIS LARGER WORST CASE HOUSING IS POPULATION. HAS TO BE GETTING MORE SUPPLY HIGH BOTH MARQUERITE AFFORDABLE THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT THAT THAT'S GONNA TAKE TIME. THIS BLOOM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND YOU'RE AT AND FOR YOUR FOCUS ON THIS. VERY IMPORTANT TROUBLING LONG TERM TROUBLING TROUBLING ISSUE. I I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU MISTER METCALF THAT TO A OF. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING VERSES SHELTER CARE THAT IS THE GOLD STANDARD IT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE MOVING AT TOWARDS BUT THE REALITY ON THE STREETS. AND NOT EUPHEMISTICALLY ON STREETS ACTUALLY ON THE STREETS. IS THAT WE'RE SEEING INCREASING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS. A CAMPING OUT ON THE STREETS. INTO IN. AND IN MOBILE HOMES A AND AND AND THE LIKE AND THAT'S ALL OVER THE STATE AND IT'S AND MORE CITIES THAN IT'S EVER BEEN AND AND IT'S SET IN PLAIN VIEW IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN REVENGE AND. AND SO. AS ONE WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR TWENTY YEARS. AND WHO VERY STRONGLY BELIEVES IN THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. A MODEL. I HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT. NOT PLACING SOME FUNDS INTO SHELTER CARE. ITEM AND EXPECTING WITH THE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE INCREASING NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE STREETS AS. PROBABLY NOT REALISTICALLY AND I WISH THAT I WAS WRONG IN THAT. A AND ANNA AND OBSERVATION. BUT. AT I DO THINK THAT RAPIDLY HOUSING AS IS IMPORTANT TO A RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND EVICTION PER. PREVENTION ARE ALL AREAS THAT ARE RECEIVING. A TWO LITTLE FUNDING AT THIS POINT IN TIME GIVEN THE. A ABYSMAL STATE OF OUR HOUSING EFFORTS. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO REFORM A HOUSING LAWS. I I I I. IT THINK THAT KEEPING INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR CURRENT HOUSING IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND NOT GETTING ENOUGH ATTENTION CURRENTLY SEWER I WONDERING IF YOU COULD PROVIDE SET THE BOTTOM DOLLARS. ON THOSE THREE AREAS SO THAT I KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING NOW AND AND THEN YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION WITH YOU NOW BUT. A IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW. OWE A WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE WHAT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING IN TERMS OF. OF. FOR WHATEVER DOLLARS WERE SPENDING FOR EXAMPLE ON RENTAL ASSISTANCE HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO KEEP. IN THEIR HOMES AS OPPOSED TO THEM LOSING A HOUSE WHERE THEY'VE HAD A RENT INCREASE OR ARE. A A A A PAYCHECK OR RENTAL PAYMENT AWAY FROM. OF BEING ON THE STREETS IS THAT POSSIBLE. WELL I I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW I MISS NEVER SEE SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM WHERE WERE WE PUT UP ABOUT FORTY. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS YEAR THERE I MISSION CAO WORKS A HOUSING STABILIZATION PROGRAM MISS BUT FROM SOCIAL SERVICES AND SLICK AT THE CHART HERE. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW EIGHTY UP THIS SUMMER FIVE MILLION. DUMPED THAT ALL OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO RENTAL ASSISTANCE. THE BULK OF THEM ARE GOING TO SOME SORT OF AN INTERVENTION THAT YOU'RE HOPING TO BECOME. STAND THEIR EXISTING HOME OR IF THEY FALLING OUT CAN QUICKLY MOVING THEM BACK AND IN IN THE HOUSE SIX OF THOSE ARE SHORT TERM STOPGAP. KINDS OF SOLUTIONS I'M. I GUESS I SHOULD TAKE THE THAT THE BULK OF THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS GETTING THE PLOY IN CALIFORNIA IS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL SIDE THESE ARE. THE ON HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS. WE WE WE HAVE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THINK AGAIN FEDERAL CUTS UP GETTING INTO THAT WE'VE WRITTEN HERNIA CARRYING A LOT PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES FOR HOLDING BACK ON LETTING YOU VOUCHERS BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR. THE RESERVE RESERVE BALANCES WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE ARE NOT GONNA GET SIGNALS FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION THEY'RE PROPOSING TO. TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CUTS THEIR. PUMP ANY OTHER PLACE I WOULD MENTION I SHOULD MENTION THIS IS INSTANTLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE HAD SOME VERY INNOVATIVE EXCITING PRICES LA COUNTY. OF SM CISCO ABOUT TO TRY TO USE. TOUGH FLEXIBLE LOAN POOL FUNDS THAT ACTUALLY ARE DEPLOYED WITH A HEALTH CARE VESTMENTS TO PLACE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS INTO EXISTING HOUSING BY PROVIDING THEM WITH LOCAL RENTAL SPORTS PAIRED WITH SERVICES. UP THE WHOLE PERSON CHARACTER POLITICS ALSO BEEN VERY FACILITY ABOUT THAT ABOUT CLEANER THAT WE CAN WE CAN DO MORE TO SUPPORT BUNDY'S CUT BEST PRACTICE LOCAL LEVEL. WHAT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE AN ASSESSMENT? OF OF FOLLOW ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS. VERSES THE NEED THAT'S OUT THERE IN THE INCREASING NEED. HI I I CERTAINLY THINK WE ARE NOT A POSITION WHERE WE CAN EXPECT. ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND. SO EVEN AT THE LEVELS I UNDERSTAND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A PULL BACK THAT WOULD BE TRAGIC OF BUT. A EVEN IF THERE'S NO PULL BACK WE NEED MORE DOLLARS NOT FEWER. THERE'RE IS SET MY UNDERSTANDING AND. ONE OF THE DYNAMICS HERE NOT MY UNDERSTANDING ONE OF THE DYNAMICS HERE IS. THAT. I'LL BE BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF THE RENTAL MARKET SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS ARE. TIED OF DIFFICULTY UTILIZED AND MANY OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE AREAS OF THE STATE AND CLUED IN AREAS SET IN AND AROUND MY DISTRICT WHERE. THERE HAS BEEN A TRADITION OF A GOOD DEAL OF SECTION EIGHT HOUSING THERE ARE SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOUCHERS I IF I UNDERSTAND THE NUMBER. CORRECTLY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THREATENING TO REMOVE BECAUSE THEY WERE IN HIS LAST YEAR BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T FIND. A AND A A LAMB WHO WAS WILLING TO TAKE THE VOUCHER BECAUSE THE VOUCHER AMOUNT IS LOWER THAN THE MARKET WILL PAY TO THAT LANDLORDS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE MARKET WILL PAY. SO THERE'S A DISCONNECT THERE AND THE. OUTRAGEOUS CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS THAT WE ARE SEEING VOUCHERS GO UNUSED. AND A GOVERNMENT THAT IS SAYING WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE NOT USING THEM WHICH SKINNER PULLED BACK THE THE VOUCHERS AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN. I AM NOT A NOT A POSITIVE OUTCOME AYE I THINK BECAUSE. I'VE AND I'M REPEATING MYSELF BUT IN TERMS OF THINGS I'VE BEEN SAYING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT THE. COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS. OF SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO FIX. I HAD TO FOLKS IN MY OFFICE TODAY WHO A WERE REFERENCING CA OUR CHAIRS DISTRICT. WHERE A A PREVIEW IT COST FOR HOUSING IS UPWARDS OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS CURRENTLY AND WHILE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS MIGHT BE? SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THAT WE NEED IT IT'S STILL IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD MANY PLACES OF FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS UNIT AND YOU REVEREND STUFF SHIPPING CONTAINERS WHICH IS NOT MY FAVORITE TO. A DIRECTION TO COPE BUT WE NEED TO FIND WAYS A INNOVATIVE WAYS OF LOWERING THE PER UNIT COST. NO MATTER HOW MANY DOLLARS WE HAVE AND THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE NEW RESOURCES UP THROUGH A A SPS TO AND. VARIOUS OTHER OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING INJECTED INTO THE SYSTEM. I. THE LOWER THE PER UNIT COST IS THE MORE YOU. SIMPLE FACT IS THE MORE UNITS WE CAN BUILD WITH THAT MONEY. I'M AND THE NEED IS SO GREAT THAT OF THE ALL OF THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT. WE HAVE THAT ARE COMMITTED IN WILL BE COMMITTED TO BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WILL BE INSUFFICIENT IN ANY EVENT SO WE GET MORE. BANG FOR OUR BUCK BY A A BY LOWERING THE PER UNIT COST AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A IS URGENT THAT WE NEED TO. AT AT ATTEND TO. I A AS WELL. AND THIS TIES INTO THE ISSUE ABOUT A A ABOUT SHELTER CARE THE TIMELINES FOR BUILDING HOUSING IN GENERAL IN THE MARKET PLACE. AND IN THE OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REALM ARE SO LENGTHY. THAT THE A AND THE COSTS ARE SO HIGH THAT THE IDEA THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. AGENDA UP THE HOUSING MACHINE IN OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION MACHINE. UP IN TIME TO A ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS OF THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON THE STREET OR IN DANGER OF FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS IN THE NEAR TERM. OF IS SIMPLY UNREALISTIC AND SO AGAIN A IT IS SIR OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE THAT WE PAY MORE ATTENTION TO PROVIDING. A OF OF SOME SHELTER SOME CARE FOR THOSE WHO WERE ON THE STREET SOME ADDITIONAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND OF ACTION PREVENTION FOR THOSE WHO ARE. I'D A NEAR TO HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU I'M. I I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA OBVIOUSLY. WOULD BOTH HUGE SUPPORTERS OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I I AGREE WITH YOU DIRECTOR THAT THAT WOULD BE. THE IDEAL SITUATION TO GO HA BEEN KNOWING WE HAVE I THINK YOU SAID HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND. PEOPLE ON THE STREETS TODAY. ON. WHAT I MEAN WHAT'S? WHAT WOULD BE ARM AN OPTIMISTIC TIMELINE RIGHT NOT NOT? NOT EVEN A REALISTIC ONE BUT NOT OPTIMISTIC ONE. ARE OF HOW MANY YEARS WOULD IT TAKE TO. YOU KNOW AS AS WERE WERE DEATHLY. INCREASING HOUSING SUPPLY TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THERE WHEN WE NEED TO INCREASE JUST MARQUERITE HOUSES SUPPLY. ARM. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SUPPLY IN THEN. POTENTIALLY EVEN SHELTERS I GUESS I GUESS HOW MANY HOW MANY YEARS WILL IT TAKE. IF IF WE LOOKED AT IT TODAY AND SAID HEY. UM TO MAKE IT TO MAKE A DENT IN THIS THING DON'T TAKE. FIFTY PERCENT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE US. POPULATION. HOW MANY YEARS I THINK IT? I. I I HESITATE TO TO TRY TO GIVE YOU A NUMBER THERE ARE JUST SO MANY UNKNOWNS THERE. YOU KNOW I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY REMARKS THAT YOU KNOW WE WE SHOULD TAKE SOME COMFORT THAT THERE ARE OTHER STATES AND CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. THAT TOOK ON A YOU KNOW WITH EX MADE EXPRESS GOALS TRYING GET THE FUNCTIONAL ZERO. A LOT ABOUT HAPPEN TO TWENTY TEN TWENTY TWELVE LOT OF THE MOVIE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO ZERO. NEARBY TWENTY SIX INCH WAS OF T. COMMUTE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BUT THE REALITY IS THOSE PLACES ARE NOT CALIFORNIA NO THEY ARE NOT FACING THIS INCREDIBLE SORT OF ECONOMIC CHALLENGE OF OF OF STAGNANT INCOMES COMPOUNDING WITH. BALLOONING HOUSING COSTS AND SO. NOTE ARE ACRE CHALLENGES WE ARE GOING TOWARD UPSTREAM HERE RIGHT WE TRY TO MAKE PROGRESS BUT THE TIDE IS GONE GOING AGAINST US IN MANY WAYS IN TERMS OF JUST THE GROWTH OF THIS. WHAT I CALLED WORST CASE HOUSING IS POPULATION? WHAT THE GUY AT THE CHALLENGES IN WEALTHIEST TO WHAT TURNED THE ECONOMY OFF THAT WOULD THAT WOULD NOT A NUMBER HOW THAT WOULD BE THE WAY TO LOWER THE HOUSING COSTS? ON OF THE WHICH IS PRETTY YOUR UPS RIGHT MEMBERS WERE STRUGGLING WITH. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. HOW TO DO THIS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S? YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU TAUGHT DO UP WE CAN WRITE THAT THAT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE EXAMPLES OF YOUR PRODUCT. A THINKING OF ON. YEAH I DID I DID ONE ASKED PARTNER FINDS YOU IN GOOD MENTION DIRECTOR COUPLE NUMBERS. AROUND. IMAGE P. IN THE FIFTY MILLION IN THE U. S. G. THIRTY SIX MILLION. NOT AND NEITHER OF THOSE SHOW UP ON MY. CHARGE WHICH I BELIEVE ARE THE CHARTS THAT MY STAFF AND. FINANCE WORKED ON IS THERE A REASON WHY. MAY AND ECONOMIC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE CHART THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU REPRESENTS THE FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND SO FROM IN THE CASE OF IOUS SHE FOR EXAMPLE FUNDING THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED WAS NOT INCLUDED AGAIN TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING. I'VE A SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CHART. WHICH WHICH WAS ACTUALLY APPROPRIATED IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT. AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BCP PROVIDED THE RESOURCES TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS. OKAY. SO THE MONEY WE APPROPRIATED. I IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WOULD BE IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. I'M THE THE FUNDING WOULD HAVE RATED YOU AND THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT. FOR THAT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET CONGRESSIONALLY SO'S WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET AS WELL. THAT WERE SET ON THE FUNDING WAS PROVIDED FOR THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION YESTERDAY THAT'S THAT WOULD BE REFLECTED THERE. SO IT'S LIKE AS PART PART OF OUR OUR OUR CHALLENGES AND LIKE I CAN'T DIRECTED EVERYBODY WHICH IS. ON. IS ARE YOU KNOW WE WERE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM MONITOR? WE KNOW THAT MONEY ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. THAT. WE CAN'T EVEN SEEM TO QUITE FIT ROUTE. WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING WHAT ITS BEING SPENT ON? AND HOW MUCH MONEY. THERE IS. SO IS THERE A WAY AT LEAST THAT CAN BE. ADDRESSED VERY. QUICKLY. ANYBODY CAN ANSWER. I GUESS I WOULD JUST ECHO THE SENTIMENTS THAT YOU EXPRESSED THAT IT IS. ANY CHALLENGE TO QUANTIFY BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN ALL OF THE ABOVE STRATEGY AND WE COME AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND SO. ON. THE STATE FIRST ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY ALL THE FUNDING ACROSS VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. WITHIN THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT IS A CHALLENGE IN CONTINUING TO WORK AT THIS. BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE NOTABLY WE WE WE HAVE BEEN ADDRESS WE CAN GOING THROUGH THE SOFA CUSHIONS LOOKING FOR THE NICHOLS THAT THAT WE CAN HEAR HIM BUT BECAUSE OF THE. YOU KNOW THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION SO SO MANY CASES WHAT THE NUMBERS THAT WERE TALKING TO HERE REFLECT FUNDS WERE WE'VE GONE BACK TO PASS YOUR ALLOCATIONS AND ACTUALLY CLAWED BACK DOLLARS BECAUSE OF NON PERFORMANCE. OF EXTRA LIKE THOSE MONIES ARE MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THERE. SOME CASES WE HAD DOLLARS OUT WITH THE LEGACY PROGRAMS THAT ARE NO LONGER RELEVANT AND TRY TO REPURPOSE THEM THROUGH THE SPORT OF HOUSING. MUCH DIRECTORY AS WELL SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE ABSENCE OF YOU AT THIS POINT TIME NOT HAVING. YOU KNOW THE DEDICATED PERMITS SOURCE TO DRAW ON OR GET NOT HAVING BEEN ABOUT A NEW A NEW INFUSION BOND FUNDS. OKAY ARE I HEAR THAT. NOT REALLY THE MOST ACCEPTABLE ANSWER IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ARMS. WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN? ON. BUT POSSESS WHICH IS THIS THIS HAS BEEN CLEARLY. COMMUNICATED TO BE. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE NOT JUST IN MY CITY BUT I THINK IN MOST. MOST CITIES ACROSS THE LEAST THE LARGE CITIES ACROSS THE STATE. HARM. WE ARE ALL GETTING GAS WHAT THE STATE IS DOING. HOME THE STATE IS IS TRYING TO DO MORE IN THIS AREA BUT ITS HARD TO DO MORE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE. SO HARM. HOW SOON CAN WE? GET A CLEARER PICTURE OR A MORE ACCURATE. PICTURE I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORT OF. GOING BACK LOOKING AT OTHER PROGRAMS GETTING MONEY RE PURPOSING I THINK THAT'S FABULOUS I THINK IT'S. CHAU INGENUITY BUT. HOME IT DOESN'T HELP US THROUGH OUR PROCESS. AND I DON'T WANNA BE BUREAUCRATIC ABOUT A PLAY DO I LEAST WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE SPENDING AND WHERE IT'S GOING. SOUTH CENTRAL HAVE THAT. IN A MOCHA FIGHTER. AFTERNOON SIR DANIEL PRINTED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE CAN WORK WITH STAFF TO COME UP WITH THAT INFORMATION DEVELOP A TIMELINE KILLED IT MORE SPECIFIC PSALM ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. HAD MENTIONED. AT THIS IS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE. BUT DAMN I'M. I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN DO IT I WOULD SAY. HOPEFULLY WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO DELEGATE RICH YET BECAUSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS. THESE TOOK FOUR WEEKS IN THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT. YOU KNOW IT AN ENTIRE. COMPLETELY YOU KNOW. STOCK PLEASE STOP SHOT I THINK IS CONCERNING. RIGHT AND I THINK THAT ON. I OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT TO ADVOCATE FOR PROP MORE PREPARATIONS IF THERE IS ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR. IF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING HASN'T REALLY PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE EITHER. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT JUST MORE MUCH JUST MORE MONEY IS ALWAYS DANCERS WAS WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AS WERE DEPLOYING FUNDS THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PROTECTIVENESS TO IT MISTER BLUE. I. THERE ARE NUMBER OF FIFA OF FOLKS AROUND THE STATE WHO HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE. OF A ASK THE GOVERNOR TO CREATE A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS. AN APPROPRIATE ARE A GOOD IDEA PUTTING PUTTING THAT ASIDE I THINK WE SHOULD BE TREATING THIS ISSUE AS IF IT WERE AN EMERGENCY SO. I I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY I AM NOT SAYING THAT THAT YOU DON'T SEE IT IS IMPORTANT AND THEY HAVEN'T. BEEN PUTTING EFFORT INTO IT BUT I I THINK THAT IF WE START TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. BEYOND. THAT WILL BE HELPFUL I I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FFSA ARE ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE AS AS THEY ARE AND AND. MANY PLACES AROUND THE STATE AND OF VOTER DAY OF. A. TO GET THE AMOUNT OF DATA. THE SALES TAX MEASURE THAT IS INTENDED TO. AT AND THAT WILL GENERATE FUNDING. TO A BILL TEN THOUSAND UNITS OVER TEN YEARS. THAT'S THE GOAL OF. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I'VE GOT THIS JUST AS WE SEE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE ARE BOTTLENECKS IN OUR LOCAL EFFORTS AND THERE'S CURRENTLY. NO PLAN FOR ACTUALLY STE A. OF FIGURING OUT HOW WE INCREASE THE HOUSING PRODUCTION AFFORDABLE HOUSING A OF FOR HOMELESS PRODUCTION FROM WHERE IT IS NOW TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE TO GET TO A THOUSAND. UNITS A YEAR IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES UP TO THE WE GET TO THAT TEN THOUSAND AND TEN YEARS. SO WE ALL AND THAT THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS THAT WE ALL FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL TO THE STATE TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL NEED TO BE. WORKING TOGETHER TO A FOCUS ON EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE'S A BOTTLE NECK AND AYE AYE EVERY ISSUE THAT A OF WHICH THERE ARE A MYRIAD HAD THAT AFFECT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND ARE AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE EFFECTIVELY. ESTO ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION SO I GUESS WE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE THIRTY SIX MILLION. THAT. WHEN TO ESG FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET BUT MY STAFF JUST. ON. A BRIEF IN ME I I GUESS WE WE BELIEVE THERE'S A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN AND. I GUESS WHEN DID EITHER THE FIFTY OR THE THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS GO. AND WHAT DID IT GO TO. WEAVER REFERRING TO A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FOR ON. THAT EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM BUT ACTUALLY TEN MILLION OF THAT WAS SPECIFIED TO BE USED BY THE. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AS OF THAT MONEY WENT TO. YES AND SO THERE'S THIRTY FIVE MILLION APPROPRIATED IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. BUT RESEARCHERS WERE NOT PROVIDED FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER THOSE FUNDS UNTIL AT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BCP WAS APPROVED AND SO NOW IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE PROCESS AND. IS UNDER WAY TO DISTRIBUTE THE SPENT GOT IT. AND INDEED A WITH. OAS DID THE TEN MILLION THAT WAS THE. YES I AM. UTV AND EMERGENCY SERVICES PERMANENTLY CUT. ERICA OKAY. ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL. FOLLOWING. YEAH AND WE WE APPRECIATE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ARM. SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE. ME OVER AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ONLY BEEN RAMPING UP TO SO IT'S IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE IMPATIENT WE DO WANT TO. MAKE SURE WERE. GETTING SOME PROPER ACCOUNTS WE CAN REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO. AUGMENT RESOURCES AND WHERE TO PUT THEM THIS IS DEFINITELY AN AREA THAT WE WILL BE NO YOU FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY I THINK WE FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY BUT WE ALL WANT TO BE. GROWN IN THE SAME DIRECTION. SO I'M. WELL YES SIR I WAS. FORGET THE PART OF PUBLIC COMMENT. I ANY PUBLIC COMMENT SORRY SORRY ABOUT THAT. MY APOLOGIES. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN LUIS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YEAR THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE TODAY'S DISCUSSION AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND WOULD JUST ASK THAT WE CAN REALLY. PUT THEM ATTENTION ON YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES IN THE CONVERSATION THEY DO GET MESSED WE TALK A LOT ABOUT VETERANS ARE TALK ABOUT CHRONIC. BUT THE NUMBER FOR YOU IS GROWING AND IT'S OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND LAST POINT TIME CANNOT AND IT'S GROWN. THIRTY TWO PERCENT LOSS TWO YEARS I THINK IS THE TO STICK AROUND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE CHRONICALLY HOMES ADULTS EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS THAN WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. I KNOW SOME A WOMAN RUBIO IS I'M WORKING ON HAVING ADAM. SINCE WINNING SET ASIDE FOR HOMELESS YOU SPECIFICALLY AND REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SOMETHING AND WHATEVER LARGER CONTEXT SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU. SO THANK YOU. DEAR MISTER CHAIR I MEN'S OSCAR VIEQUES I'M HERE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO KNOWN AS SHE SEC. ON JUDGEMENT OBJECT TO MINUTES I COULDN'T JUST A. CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AS AS THE IMPORTANT START EVEN UNDERSCORE HERE SO I'VE BEEN SERVING ON THE ALL KIND WERE SUPERVISORS ARE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND PRIOR TO THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. AYE FROM FOURTEEN YEARS IN THE CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO'S HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF LOOK THAT CITY AND COUNTY LANDS AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING TOGETHER AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT'S GOING TO BE. ENTER THE TUNNEL ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I ALSO SERVED ON AND MANY MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SERVED ON AT HEART COMMITTEES TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF. OF HOMELESSNESS AS YOU KNOW. DESPITE THE DECLINING NUMBERS OF HOMELESS BETWEEN AT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. I AM IN RESPONSE TO THAT. ARE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND THE LEAGUE OF CITIES ACTUALLY GOT TOGETHER TO DISCUSS HOW IT IS THAT WE MIGHT WORK TOGETHER MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A WE DEVELOPED A JOINT TASK FORCE. I OF THAT TASK FORCE WAS CO CHAIRED BY MYSELF AS WELL AS WELL AS HOW WITH THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I JAN ARTICLE FROM. GRASS VALLEY. AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT ACTUALLY DESPITE HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET THESE KIND REPORTS TOGETHER WE HAVE A WONDERFUL PORTABLE GONNA RELEASE TOMORROW. A THAT WILL PROVIDE A WHOLE RANGE OF INFORMATION THAT MUCH OF WHICH IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY. IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES EMERGENCY PRACTICES EXAMPLES OF GOOD PARTNERSHIPS WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE DOING. A BECAUSE OFTENTIMES AND GOVERNMENT WERE RISK AVERSE WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO TAKE THAT RISK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THESE THIS REPORT WILL SERVE AS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF OF A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE DONE WORKING TOGETHER TO BE. A SUCCESSFUL. AND SO WHILE THIS REPORT ISN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE A SILVER BULLET. ARM IT CONSERVATORY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY PROGRAMS INITIATIVES PARTNERSHIPS. FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AS EACH COMMUNITY IS REALLY UNIQUE AND HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES. AS I WANT THINK LEGISLATURE FOR ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB TWO S. B. THREE AT NO PLACE LIKE HOME. ABOUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT IN CALIFORNIA. WERE HOME TO TWENTY ONE OF THE THIRTIETH MOST EXPENSIVE RENTAL MARKETS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND OF THE STATE'S TWO POINT TWO MILLION EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND VERY LOW INCOME. A RENTER HOUSEHOLDS OTHER COMPETING FOR ONLY SIX AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS WHIMS CONTINUE TO PARTNER WORK TOGETHER WITH THE STATE. LOTS LITTLE LOT OF MOVING PIECES RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THE GUIDELINES ARE BEING DRAFTED FOR S. B. TWO LAWYERS ARE WORKING ON A NO PLACE LIKE HOME VOTERS WILL CONSIDER WHETHER NOT THE STATE SHOULD. ISSUE S. B. THREE A BONDS IN NOVEMBER. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT MONEY FROM THE STATE COMING IN THE COMING YEAR COULD BE PUT TO USE. IMMEDIATELY BY BY CITIES AND COUNTIES ON CONCLUSION IT'S CLEAR THAT HOMELESS HAS REACHED A CRISIS POINT FOR ALL OF US ARE HOPING THAT THEY COULDN'T HIRE. A COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE WILL TRULY PARTNER WITH COUNTIES AS WE GO FORWARD TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER. THANK YOU. ANY THE PUBLIC COMMENT.
