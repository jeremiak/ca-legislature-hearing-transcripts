AND THAT'S ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR FOUR SEVEN. THIS IS A SPECIAL HEARING JUST HERE AB THIRTY FIVE WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE CAN START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE SO WE WILL DO. JUST THAT MS REYES AND MR UMBERG. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIR MEMBERS. AB THIRTY FIVE IS SOMETHING THERE'S BEEN WORKED ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS DECADES IN FACT BY MANY WHO CAME BEFORE US WHO BEEN WORKING ON SUCH IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. IT REPRESENTS OVERDUE REFORM TO THE MEDICAL INJURY COMPENSATION REFORM ACT KNOWN AS MICRO. CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL MALPRACTICE STATUTE HAS BEEN UNCHANGED FOR NEARLY FIVE DECADES AND OVER THATTIME HAS MAGNIFIED AND EXACERBATED POLITICAL DIFFERENCES. AB THIRTY FIVE REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE THAT WILL PROVIDE FAIR AND SENSIBLE COMPENSATION TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED A HEALTH CARE INJURY. OR FOR THE FAMILY IF HE PATIENT SUFFERED DEATH WELL AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING CONTINUED CERTAINTY AND STABILITY FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS PLAINTIFFS NON ECONOMIC RECOVERY KNOWN AS PAIN AND SUFFERING TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS REGARDLESS OF THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THE INJURED PATIENT OR THE FAMILY WHOSE LOVED ONES DIED. FROM THE MALPRACTICE. THIS HAS BEEN UNCHANGED FOR ALMOST FIVE DECADES. IN SUMMARY THIS HISTORIC AGREEMENT INCREASES THE AMOUNT FOR NON ECONOMIC RECOVERY CASES OF WORDS PERSONAL INJURY. INSTEAD OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WILL BE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT WILL INCREASE INCREMENTALLY. UNTIL IT REACHES SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AFTER TEN YEARS. IF THE MALPRACTICE. CAUSED A WRONGFUL DEATH THAT CAP RATHER THAN BEING TWO FIFTY WILL BE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE FIRST YEAR. AND CONTINUE TO INCREASE INCREMENTALLY UNTIL IT REACHES ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AFTER TEN YEARS. THEREAFTER THAT CAP BEGINNING IN TWENTY THIRTY FOUR WILL BE INCREASED BY 2% FOR COLA INCREASE. WHICH WILL BEGIN JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY THIRTY FOUR AND THE JUST THE CAPS ANNUALLY. AB THIRTY FIVE ALSO CREATES THREE SEPARATE CATEGORIES OF DEFENDANTS. ONE MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE PHYSICIANS. THE SECOND HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS OR HOSPITALS. AND TO THE OTHER GROUP THE OTHER CATEGORY IS UNAFFILIATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING AMBULANCES AND POLITE. AB THIRTY FIVE REFLECTS. SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH WHAT WERE ONCE VIEWED AS INSURMOUNTABLE DISAGREEMENTS AND POLITICAL DIVIDES. IT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT FIGHTS THAT APPEAR. TO BIND US FOR DECADES AS THIS HAS ARE ONLY AS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERCOME AS WE ALLOW THEM TO BE. WE'RE HOPING THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT AB THIRTY FIVE WILL SERVE AS A MODEL FOR FUTURE EFFORTS TO PROVE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. CAN ACTUALLY WORK AND IT WILL WORK WITH FAIRNESS AND EQUITY WHEN THE PARTIES TO GET TOGETHER AND AGREE TO COME TO AN A SOLUTION. I'D LIKE NOT TO I'D LIKE TO NOW HANDED OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHOR SENSOR- BURKE WHO WILL PROVIDE A FEW.

HAS BEEN DECADES IN THE MAKING- AND- FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY A CO AUTHOR ON IT- THE BUT- JUST WANT TO SHOW GRATITUDE TO EVERYONE THAT CAME TOGETHER- IN RECOGNITION THAT- WE USUALLY HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME. WHEN WE FIND THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE PLACE TO COME TOGETHER DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN. HAS BEEN INDICATED OVER MANY MANY YEARS. OF. THIS ISSUE IN A- RAISING ITS HADN'T OF EVERY EVERY SEVERAL YEARS. THAT BEING SAID IN- I WON A- REALLY- GET MY GRATITUDE ALL THE VICTIMS OF THAT HAVE SUFFERED. OVER THE YEARS I THINK THAT THERE'S A CLEAR RECOGNITION- WITH THIS RESOLUTION. THAT MORE NEEDED TO BE DONE- TO SHOW RESPECT AND DIGNITY- OF FOR THOSE THAT HAVE SUFFERED AND- I'M GRATEFUL- THAT- INTO THE MICRO COALITION ALSO. SAW FIT- MET TO. YOU KNOW COME TO THE TABLE AND PUT AN END TO I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN OF SEVERAL PAINFUL CHAPTERS I THINK IN THE END THIS BATTLE THAT- ULTIMATELY DOESN'T SERVE ANY OF US. AND SO VERY GRATEFUL- TO THE AUTHORS IN THE COALITION THAT HAS COME TOGETHER FROM BOTH SIDES TO- BRING THIS TO US AND GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF WHAT I THINK IS A- REALLY IMPORTANT. DAY AND APART MOMENT- AND IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND- ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO OUR CHAIR AND HIS STAFF- WHO I KNOW HAS HAD TO DEALT WITH IT GRAPPLE WITH THESE ISSUES. THAT THAT THAT COULD LEAD ARISE FROM THE NON RESOLUTION. OF THIS ISSUE OVER SO MANY YEARS AND SO- AB WOODEN WE HAVE QUORUM I'LL BE HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTHER LIKE STARK OUT OF MY HEAD WE HAVE HORRIBLE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A MOTION BUT I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR IT TO EVERYONE. FOR COMING TOGETHER ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PIECE LEGISLATION THAT I HOPE- INCLUDING- THE COMMENTS THAT THE ASPECT OF THE BENEVOLENT GESTURES LOOK ALTERNATELY THIS IS ABOUT HEALING- IN ABOUT US MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT I THINK WILL HOPEFULLY CREATE BUILD A BETTER RELATIONSHIP- WHEN IT COMES TO DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIPS. CREATE MORE TRUST- WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND ULTIMATELY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CREATE AS MUCH CLOSURES WE CAN YOU CAN ALWAYS CREATE SEVEN CLOSURE WHEN THEY'RE SUCH GREAT LOSS YOU CAN TRY TO LEASE. SO THOSE ARE. HELLO I THINK HOPE IS WILL GO. TO US WAY FOR US TO LEAST SHOW THAT WE READ- THE PAIN SUFFERING AND THAT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE BENEFIT AND THE ABILITY. FOR OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO EXPRESS THEIR GRIEF AND THEIR SYMPATHY AS WELL WHICH I THINK IS- IT'S HARD TO PUT A TO ATTACH A VALUE TO THAT. BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TO HAVE THAT IN YEARS WELL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M GONNA PAUSE IN SYSTEMS FOR OF WORLD PLEASE STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM BLOOM. HERE DAVIES. HANEY KALRA.

I HAS BROUGHT A LOT OF PAIN IT'S BROUGHT A LOT OF TRAUMA I IT'S BROUGHT A LOT OF CONCERN I THINK FOR PEOPLE FOR MANY YEARS AND- THE WORK THAT IT'S TAKING WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN ISSUE LIKE THAT- IS SO MUCH HARDER AND IT'S SO MUCH MORE PRESSING TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE POOR. AND TO WORK OUT A COMPROMISE. THAT IMPROVES THE OUTCOMES FOR VICTIMS THAT ENSURES THAT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED THAT UNDERSTANDS- THE PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM- AND THEN MOVES US FORWARD AND SO I JUST AM SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU ALL- SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE THAT YOU LISTEN TO THAT YOU. CAME TO THIS COMPROMISE I THINK FROM FOR MANY PEOPLE FOR MANY YEARS THERE WAS A SENSE THAT- IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE CHANGE ON THIS IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS BUILDING- BUT IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF YOU ARE COMING TOGETHER AND YOU ARE CONVENING THEM SO I'M I'M I'M GRATEFUL THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING FORWARD HERE IN IN MAKING THESE IMPORTANT CHANGES- THAT WILL IMPROVE THIS LAW AND- AND THAT IT WAS DONE. BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY IT SO I'M PROUD TO BE HERE ON MY FIRST THE FIRST DAY IN COMMITTEE ABLE TO VOTE IN MY FIRST VOTING COMMITTEE ON SOMETHING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO IMPACTFUL- AND HISTORIC IN MANY WAYS AND IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT PROCESS AND THE RIGHT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE WHO. LEAVE THE OUT. THANK YOU SO MISTER CHAIR. AND TO HIM FOR HAPPY TO BE ON ON THE CAN AND THE TO A ARE A NEW COLLEAGUE AS A MEMBER- HANEY I JUST REFERENCE THIS IS A- UP FAIRLY HISTORIC DAY AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR HELPING TO BRING US THERE- I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT. THAT YOU COULDN'T OF DONE IT ALONE YOU DID IT WITH THE- HELP AND CONSENT OF THE- OF VARIOUS PARTIES WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THIS ISSUE IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING. IT HAS BEEN A DIVISIVE ISSUE. THERE ARE. EQUITIES ON BOTH SIDES OF IT- AND HI- EXTREMELY PLEASED THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO HELP BRING THE PARTIES TO A- A SUCCESSFUL AGREEMENT AND CONCLUSION THAT WERE HERE TO ESSENTIALLY RATIFIED TODAY AND TO- SO I THANK YOU TO EVERYONE. WHO'S AND IN. I BRING THIS A SUCCESSFUL. IT TO IT DOES- SHOW THAT- IN OF THIS ISSUE'S BEEN PERCOLATING FOR. MANY MANY YEARS NOW OF THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE FOR COMPROMISE AND TO- THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS SEEK AND ALWAYS LOOK FOR SOME GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO BRING IT HOME. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMING TO THE COMMITTEE. RIGHT TO THE AUTHORS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. REPRESENTING THIS AND IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND TO THE COALITION WHO BROUGHT THIS TOGETHER. THIS IS REALLY BEEN WHAT I TERMINATE AT AN ENTRENCHED ISSUE EVERYBODY IN THEIR TRENCHES AND UNWILLING TO BUDGE AND YET. ANY LIMITATION ON THE ECONOMICS OF HOW THE LEGAL SYSTEM WORKS. AT SOME POINTS BY ITS NATURE BECOMES AN IMPEDIMENT TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT IS REALLY WHAT THIS HAS BECOME OVER THE YEARS. SO IT THIS IS A HISTORIC MOMENT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN RECOGNIZING LEGISLATION AND WITH THE LONGEVITY OR SOMETIMES A LACK OF LONGEVITY OF LEGISLATION IN HOW IT GETS IMPLEMENTED OVER TIME AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION NOT JUST BECAUSE IT IS FINALLY BRINGING TOGETHER WHAT HAD BEEN ENTRENCHED INTERESTS AND HAVING A CONVERSATION AND NOW OPENING UP ACCESS TO JUSTICE BUT IT'S A SOLUTION THAT THAT HAS A MUCH MUCH LONGER HORIZON TO BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE IN TO BE UTILIZED AND I THINK THAT'S THE AT THE HEART. OF WHY THIS IS. REALLY SO IMPORTANT IT'S HISTORIC BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KIND OF BREAK THE LOGJAM BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS A VERY WELL CRAFTED THOUGHTFUL. SOLUTION THAT LOOKS TO THE FUTURE AND- VERY FRANKLY VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE AND BE A PART OF THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO OFFER THIS ALONG AND FOR THOSE WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION AS WITH ANYTHING THERE MAY VERY WELL BE CLEAN UP LANGUAGE THIS IS NOT A CONSENT ITEM BUT IT IS A CONCURRENCE ITEM WHICH MEANS WE ARE NOT ABLETO AMEND IT WITHOUT SENDING IT BACK TO THE SENATE BOTH HOUSES HAVE TO AGREE AT EXACTLY THE SAME FORM THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY AND FROM MY STANDPOINT THIS. BILL IT'S CONSTRUCTION IT'S HISTORY HOW IT CAME TOGETHER ABSOLUTELY PASSES MUSTER FOR THIS COMMITTEE AN OPENING VERY MUCH THAT WE WILL PASS IT HERE TODAY THAT WE WILL GET IT OFF THE FLOOR AND TO THE GOVERNOR FOR SIGNATURE. ALL RIGHT. CENTER OVER DID YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS- WELL THANK VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ELOQUENT COMMENTS. UP THE SPECIAL THANKS TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE IMPACTED FOR THEIR PASSION. THERE THEIR PAIN USING THAT FOR POSITIVE CHANGE SO THANK YOU ALL- I WOULD SIMPLY URGE AN AYE VOTE AND- LET'S GET THIS THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU MADAM. MAJORITY LEADER. YOU GET THE LAST WORD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK OF THE WORD HISTORIC IS USED. TODAY AND IT IS APPROPRIATE TO ITS THIS IS MONUMENTAL. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PARTIES INVOLVED THE STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN A- IT'S MOVING WHENEVER WE'D BE ABLE TO EVER SO GRATEFUL FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS EVERY SINGLE ONE. I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE A SOLO OF PHYSICIANS ND FOR THEIR POSITION CERTAINLY- IMPORTANT POINTS THAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT UP AND THEIR IMPORTANCE. IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE- STATEMENTS OF BENEVOLENCE THIS IS IMPORTANT- ARE PHYSICIANS DO CARE ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS THEY DO CARE THEY RECOGNIZE SOMETIMES WHEN THERE HAS BEEN AN ERROR BUT CANNOT EXPRESS ANY REMORSE CANNOT EXPRESS ANY COMMENTS AND THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THAT HUMANE ASPECT TO THEIR PRACTICE WHICH IS PART OF WHO THEY ARE ALSO. TO OUR PATIENTS WHO ARE HERE WITH US. AND THE FAMILIES OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO WHO SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF THE NEGLIGENCE I'M GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR SHARING THEIR HURT SHARING WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED SO THE WE ALL RECOGNIZE JUST HOW IMPACTFUL THIS LEGISLATION IS. I AM GRATEFUL TO TAMMY SMACK. WHO SPOKE ABOUT HER SON WHO TOLD US ABOUT WHAT SHE SUFFERED WITH HER FAMILY SUFFERED BECAUSE OF WHAT HER SON WENT THROUGH. I'M GRATEFUL TO DR WALES REPRESENTING ALL OF THE PHYSICIANS WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND WHAT THIS MEANS TO THEM NO NO RESOLUTION IS EVER GOING TO BE PERFECT WE KNOW THAT ESPECIALLY AS ATTORNEYS. BUT WHEN WE GET TO A POINT WHERE EACH ONE OF US FEELS WE CAN LIVE WITH THAT RESOLUTION WHEN I GOOD. TO PETERS REPRESENT THE- THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA I'M GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT HE'S DONE AND FOR ALL OF THOSE ATTORNEYS WHO HE REPRESENTS AND TO LISA MAAS WHO'S WORKED TIRELESSLY ON THIS ISSUE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA LIFE FOR PATIENT PROTECTIONS. THIS IS A PROTECTION FOR BOTH THE PATIENTS AND THE PHYSICIANS AND I AM. RIGHTFUL THAT THESE THESE NOT JUST STAKEHOLDERS BUT THE FAMILIES AND THE PATIENTS ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. I THINK IT REPRESENTS THREE THINGS AND THESE ARE WORDS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN COMMENTS TODAY. ACCESSIBILITY WE NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS AFFORDABILITY AND THIS GOES TO WHAT OUR PHYSICIANS HAVE TO PAY. BUT IT'S ALSO ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PATIENTS FOR PHYSICIANS AND WITH THAT I WAS RESPECT RESPECTFULLY. FOR YOUR I. THEY YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS. IT I'M SORRY CONCUR IN SENATE AMENDMENTS KALRA PLEASE STONE HI STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM BLOOM BLOOM I DAVIES DAVIES HI HANEY HANEY I KALRA.
