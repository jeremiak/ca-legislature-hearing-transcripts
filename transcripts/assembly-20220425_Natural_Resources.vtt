APPROPRIATE URGENCY. FOR THOSE

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:41.445

AS YOU HEARD FROM THOSE WHO ARE

00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:45.449
CALLING AND SUPPORT TODAY OUR

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:47.351
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE FELT

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:49.920
THE IMPACT OF THIS. BAD AIR

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:52.155
POLLUTION FOR FAR TOO LONG AND

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:54.291
BELIEVE THAT ULTIMATELY THE

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:56.093
STATE BEARS RESPONSIBILITY AND

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.361
WHAT WAS LEFT OUT OF THE

00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.830
OPPOSITION'S COMMENTARY IS. A

00:49:59.896 --> 00:50:01.631
LOCAL LAWSUIT WHICH IS BEING

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:04.634
PLACED AGAINST THE EPA FOR NOT

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:07.371
MEETING AND ALLOWING US TO REACH

00:50:07.437 --> 00:50:11.241
OUR STANDARDS. ULTIMATELY

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.744
THERE'S SOME- RESPONSIBILITY

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.612
THAT WE MAY HAVE TO FACE VIA

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.781
SANCTIONS AS A STATE IF WE DO

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.983
NOT MEET THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.018
BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE MORE

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:24.421
PROACTIVE FROM OUR- AIR

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:26.923
RESOURCES BOARD SO THAT WE CAN-

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.259
AFFECT THE CHANGE WE KNOW NEEDS

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:32.429
TO HAPPEN. BY THE WAY THEY

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.663
COMMITTEE AND ELSE THIS

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.898
INDICATES A- AN AMENDMENT DID

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:48.979
MEMBER RANDY LEE MENTIONED A

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:51.314
RECENT LAWSUIT ON OUR OUR PM TWO

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.582
POINT FIVE PLAN THAT WAS

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:54.618
SUBMITTED TO EPA AND THERE WERE

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:55.519
A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS TO THAT

00:50:55.585 --> 00:51:00.357
LAWSUIT- EPA FOUND IN FAVOR OF.

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:02.225
CARP AND THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:03.660
PORTIONS OF THE PLAN AND ALL

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:05.495
AREAS BUT ONE. THEY FOUND THAT

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:07.464
ON THE STATIONARY SOURCE SIDE WE

00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:08.932
MET THE REQUIREMENT OF HAVING

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:10.167
MOST TRENCHANT MEASURES WHICH

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:11.368
MEANS BASICALLY OUR RULES ARE

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:13.203
MORE STRINGENT THAN ANY ROLE.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.204
ANYWHERE ELSE THROUGHOUT THE

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.373
COUNTRY. THE ONE AREA THAT THEY

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.642
FOUND OUR PLAN FELL SHORT. WAS A

00:51:18.708 --> 00:51:19.876
SHORTFALL IN INCENTIVE FUNDS

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:21.812
THAT WERE COMMITTED TO IN THE

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:22.412
PLAN TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:24.614
MOBILE SOURCES- THAT WAS THE

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.616
ONLY PROVISION OF THE LAWSUIT

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:27.350
THAT WE WEREN'T MARC SUCCESSFUL

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:30.153
IN DEFENDING. AND AND WE ARE IN

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.389
NO WAY SAYING OUR WORK HERE IS

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:34.324
DONE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AT

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:35.826
AT THOSE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:37.794
OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE MATURE

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:39.296
REDUCTIONS- BUT WE DO FEEL THAT

00:51:39.362 --> 00:51:42.399
WERE THE MOST QUALIFIED TO DO

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:44.167
THAT. IN OUR REGION. ADAM OR MR

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:46.036
VICE CHAIR IF I CAN PULL AND DR

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.204
CATHERINE GROUP OF WHITE THE

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.472

CENTRAL VALLEY. AIR COALITION AS

WELL TO RESPOND ACCOMPLICE. DR

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:54.277
THANK YOU- SO FIRST I WOULD SAY

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:55.979
THAT THE RECENT DECISION ON THE

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.314
LAWSUIT SHOWS THAT WE HAVE A

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.682
HISTORY OF OVER RELYING ON

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:00.183
INCENTIVE DOLLARS AND WE CAN'T

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.318
JUST KEEP THROWING MONEY IN A

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:03.186
BLACK HOLE AND ASSUME THAT IT'S

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.621
GOING TO GET US THERE. BY OUR

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:06.223
OWN ANALYSIS EVEN IF WE WERE

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:08.191
ABLE TO OBTAIN THAT ITS

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:08.825
INCENTIVE FUNDING WE PROBABLY

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:10.293
COULDN'T SPEND IT FAST ENOUGH OR

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.095
FIND ENOUGH SOURCES TO CLEAN UP.

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:13.430
IN ORDER TO MEET THE STANDARDS

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.365
AND TIME. TO OTHER ELEMENTS OF

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:17.567
THIS BILL THAT I THINK ARE

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:18.401
REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE IN THE

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:20.203
CONVERSATION IS- IT'S ONE THING

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:21.638
TO HAVE THE STRONGEST RULES IT'S

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:23.573
ANOTHER THING TO ACTUALLY GO OUT

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.508
AND ENFORCE THEM. WHICH THEIR

00:52:24.574 --> 00:52:26.643
DISTRICT HAS BEEN LACSON- AND

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:27.811
THERE'S DISAGREEMENT WHETHER

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.045
THERE'S BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.614
TECHNOLOGY OR BEST AVAILABLE

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.516
RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGY AT

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:33.750
SOME OF OUR LARGEST AND OLDEST

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:35.886
STATIONARY SOURCES. AND THE LAST

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:37.454
POINT THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:38.588
THAT'S WHAT UNIQUE ABOUT THIS

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:40.290
BILL. IS IN TRAINING THE

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:42.092
INCLUSION OF COMMUNITY BASED

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:43.393
ORGANIZATIONS AND DISADVANTAGED

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.596
COMMUNITIES THAT PREVIOUSLY HAVE

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:48.331
BEEN MARGINALIZED IN THE PROCESS

00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:50.033
. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR ANY

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.137
OTHER QUESTIONS YES. THIS RACE.

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:55.338
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS I

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:56.640
THINK SOMETIMES WHEN WE THINK

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:59.042
THAT- BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS THE

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:00.277
AUTHORITY TO TAKE CARE OF AN

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:02.546
ISSUE IF WE FIND THAT IT'S NOT

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.180
BEING TAKEN CARE OF. THEN TO

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:05.982
FIND SOME OTHER CREATIVE WAYS SO

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.951
THAT IS TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE IN

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:09.853
THE END JUST AS WAS NOTED IN TH

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.188
ANALYSIS OF TO MANY PEOPLE THAT

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:13.957
ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS THEIR

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.026
POLLUTION. AND WHATEVER WE HAVE

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:18.161
BEEN DOING AND I DON'T THINK IT

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:20.564
IS NECESSARILY SAYING SOMETHING

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.766
BAD ABOUT THE BOARD IS JUST

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:23.767
SAYING WE'VE GOT TO FIND

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.502
SOMETHING ELSE THEY'RE SAYING.

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:28.338
IT AS I UNDERSTAND IT A NEW

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.173
PROGRAM CAN BE PUT TOGETHER AND

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.875
THAT WILL BE ENFORCED AND IF

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:35.345
IT'S IF IT. ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:36.379
THEN. SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING TO

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:38.882
BE PUT IN BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:39.416
THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT.

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:41.217
PEOPLE'S LAWNS. ESPECIALLY OUR

00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:43.954
CHILDREN AND OUR SENIORS- SO

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.222
WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL

00:53:46.289 --> 00:53:47.591
IF WE HAVE QUORUM. WE WILL JUST

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:49.559

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:37.051
. YELLED CUT MY INCOME IS SHORT

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:38.919
I'M VERY FOND OF REDONDO BEACH I

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.321
MOVED THERE FROM CHICAGO AND I

01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:42.423
WAS TEN AND- HAVE THE MOVE BACK

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:44.925
TO CHICAGO SINCE I DID A COUPLE

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:46.794
OF THE POINTS THAT WERE HIT-

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.229
FIRST OF ALL THE ONES DOLENJE

01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:49.830
DISHES THAT ARGUMENT ABOUT ONCE

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:51.832
YOU COOLEY THAT THAT SHIPS THAT

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:53.100
SAILED I GUESS WAS WRONG

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:55.603
METAPHOR LONG TIME AGO. MOST OF

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:58.405
THE FACILITIES WERE REPOWER- IN

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:00.541
IN THE STATE- THERE HAVE THERE

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:02.309
ARE STILL SEVERAL THAT HAVE NOT

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:03.177
BEEN REPOWERED AND WE'RE

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:04.945
SCHEDULED TO BE RETIRED THAT ALL

01:38:05.012 --> 01:38:07.781
OF THAT IS TRUE THE REASON THEY

01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:10.117
REMAIN ON OUR LINE IS FOR

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.619
RELIABILITY REASONS I THINK

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:12.853
THERE'S GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.456
THIS AND SO IF IN FACT THE MARCH

01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:19.793
TWENTIETH- SECOND- DEPARTURE

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:21.395

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:23.964
MERCER G. COMMENTED ON EARLIER

01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:26.133
IS TRUE. THEN THIS BILL IS NOT

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.167
NECESSARY BECAUSE THESE PLANS

01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:29.870
WILL GO OUT- IN THREE YEARS THE

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:32.640
PROBLEM IS- THE TWO THINGS ONE

01:38:32.706 --> 01:38:34.575

MATURITY RELIABILITY- IT IS VERY

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:43.417
POTENTIAL- ITS POTENTIAL AND

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:45.119
PROBABLY MORE LIKELY THAT WILL

01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:46.920
BE NEEDED FOR LOCAL RELIABILITY

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:48.822
THAT MAY NOT BE THE DOES DECIDE

01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:50.858
TO RUN TO STATEWIDE ISSUE- AND

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:52.693
SO. AT ANY RATE WE ALSO HAVE

PRODUCT OR PRODUCT CATEGORY- AB

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:31.271
TWENTY FOUR FORTY IS SIMPLY A

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.006
RECOGNITION THAT SOME PRODUCTS

01:48:33.073 --> 01:48:34.674

EMBEDDED PRODUCTS IN THE SAME

01:48:57.697 --> 01:48:59.432
PROGRAM THIS BILL SEPARATES THEM

01:48:59.499 --> 01:49:01.935
INTO TWO DISTINCT PROGRAMS- THAT

01:49:02.002 --> 01:49:05.038
ALLOWS US TO YOU- ESSENTIALLY-

01:49:05.105 --> 01:49:06.206
CONSTRUCT DIFFERENT PROGRAMMATIC

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:07.974

THAT PRODUCT IN THE IN THE

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:14.080
PRODUCERS- BUT THE STRUCTURE OF

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.382

COMMITTEES. SO THE BILL'S

01:49:19.819 --> 01:49:20.720
ESSENTIALLY GONNA REQUIRE

01:49:20.787 --> 01:49:23.123
PRODUCERS TO DESIGN FUND AND

01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:25.025

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:25.638
. CONSUMERS AND THEY HAVE SOME

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:27.173
WE HAVE PLAYED PLENTY OF PLACES

BATTERIES BUT WE CAN'T GET

01:52:32.278 --> 01:52:34.614

ONES WE ALREADY HAVE. A CARD

01:52:41.721 --> 01:52:43.756
THAT WITHOUT TURNING INTO A

01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:46.893
BECAUSE THE FINES ON HERE HUGE.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.229
FOR THE OTHERS AND I AM NOT

01:52:49.295 --> 01:52:51.197
QUITE SURE HOW THEY GET- WITH

01:52:51.264 --> 01:52:52.632
THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING

01:52:52.699 --> 01:52:54.501
WILL BE FOLDED INTO THIS PROGRAM

01:52:54.567 --> 01:52:56.636
BUT THE CORNERSTONE OF THAT ANY

01:52:56.703 --> 01:52:59.005
RECYCLING PROGRAMS EDUCATION AND

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:02.342
B. THE PRODUCERS. OF WILL BE

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:03.977
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT EDUCATION

01:53:04.043 --> 01:53:06.346
AND WHETHER IT'S- TV OR ON THE

01:53:06.412 --> 01:53:09.115
INTERNET OR- NOTES WITH YOUR

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:11.784
WITH YOUR TRASH. OF IT IS

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:13.786
OBVIOUSLY NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:15.388
WHAT WHAT WHAT THE PLACES THAT

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.557
WE CURRENTLY HAVE ARE NOT

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:19.159
SUFFICIENT DIET WITH. WE KNOW

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:23.196
ALMOST- AT LEAST I HAVE A ZIPLOC

01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:24.864
BAG FILLED WITH BATTERIES AND

01:53:24.931 --> 01:53:27.867
ALMOST EVERYBODY I KNOW HAS AZIPLOC BAG FILLED WITH BATTERIES

01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:29.135
IN THEIR DRAWERS AND THEY DON'T

01:53:29.202 --> 01:53:30.470
REALLY KNOW WHERE TO GET RID OF

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:32.438
THOSE BATTERIES SO WHAT WE NEED

01:53:32.505 --> 01:53:34.107
TO MAKE THESE. PLACES WERE

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:36.809
BATTERIES CAN BE RETURNED WERE

01:53:36.876 --> 01:53:39.112
UBIQUITOUS AND WE NEED TO DO A

01:53:39.179 --> 01:53:41.381
VERY ROBUST EDUCATION PROGRAM.

I'M SURE YOU. KNOW THAT THAT IS

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:44.450
EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD SAY AS WELL

01:53:44.517 --> 01:53:46.486
I THINK EDUCATION IS GOING TO BE

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:47.353
CORNERSTONE BUT I THINK

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:48.922
CONVENIENCE IS EXTREMELY

01:53:48.988 --> 01:53:51.524
IMPORTANT THIS PROGRAM AND

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:52.659
SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE STATE

01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:55.762
CURRENTLY LACKS. YEAH THE

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:57.397
CONVENIENCE PART OF IT BECAUSE

01:53:57.463 --> 01:53:59.332
THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT THAT

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:00.867
THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT

01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:02.402
EVERYBODY HAS WITH ALL OF THIS

01:54:02.468 --> 01:54:04.237
IS YOU KNOW EVEN RECYCLING IN

01:54:04.304 --> 01:54:07.674
GENERAL IS IF IT'S TOO DIFFICULT

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:10.043
MATT AND THEN WE CAN GET PEOPLE

01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.543
TO DO AND PUNISHING THE

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:12.278
COMPANIES DOESN'T NECESSARILY

01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:13.546
MAKE THOSE PEOPLE DO IT ANY

01:54:13.613 --> 01:54:15.848

COST OF INACTION DOWN THE ROAD.

01:59:28.461 --> 01:59:30.429
THE LAST THING I WILL ADD IS

01:59:30.496 --> 01:59:31.264

FEELING IS A NEW INDUSTRY THAT

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:55.419
WAS BASED ON A SIMPLE IDEA. WHAT

02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:56.687
IF YOU'LL COULD BE DELIVERED

02:29:56.754 --> 02:29:58.389
STRAIGHT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED

02:29:58.456 --> 02:29:59.323
IT MOST LIKELY EIGHT MILLION

02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:00.825
CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES

02:30:00.891 --> 02:30:02.793
FOR WHOM ACCESS TO GAS STATIONS

02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:04.962
IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. WELL THE

02:30:05.029 --> 02:30:06.163
FEELING IS THE GREENEST WAY TO

02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:08.432
DELIVER FUEL BECAUSE IT REDUCES

02:30:08.499 --> 02:30:10.868
SPILLAGE SIGNIFICANTLY. REDUCES

02:30:10.935 --> 02:30:12.136
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND

02:30:12.203 --> 02:30:13.971
EMISSIONS BY BEING ABLE TO FUEL

02:30:14.038 --> 02:30:16.173
MORE THAN A HUNDRED VEHICLES

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:17.975
WITH JUST ONE TANKER- AND IT

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:19.410
REDUCES RELIANCE ON UNDERGROUND

02:30:19.477 --> 02:30:20.878
STORAGE TANKS AT GAS STATIONS

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:22.713
WHICH LEAK INTO THE GROUND.

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:24.315
MOBILE ENERGY DELIVERY IS ALSO

02:30:24.382 --> 02:30:26.150
KEY TO ACCELERATING THE ADOPTION

02:30:26.217 --> 02:30:27.918
OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS BECAUSE IT

02:30:27.985 --> 02:30:29.620
DOES NOT RELY ON INFRASTRUCTURAL

02:30:29.687 --> 02:30:31.489
DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE

02:30:31.555 --> 02:30:33.157
RENEWABLE DIESEL PRODUCES TWO

02:30:33.224 --> 02:30:34.725
THIRDS FEWER CARBON EMISSIONS

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:36.861
THAN REGULAR DIESEL BUT LESS

02:30:36.927 --> 02:30:38.896

02:30:50.307 --> 02:30:52.076

RENEWABLE DIESEL. THE SAME

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:54.845
PROMISE EXISTS WITH OTHER

02:30:54.912 --> 02:30:56.614
ALTERNATIVE FUELS SUCH AS TV

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:58.749
CHARGING AND HYDROGEN WHICH IS

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:00.918
WHY THIS BILL HAS THE SUPPORT OF

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.653
THE CALIFORNIA HUNDRED COALITION

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:06.157
IN BRIEF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL

02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:07.291
IS ABOUT REGULATING AN ENTIRE

02:31:07.358 --> 02:31:09.059
INDUSTRY ALMOST ALL AIR

02:31:09.126 --> 02:31:10.294
DISTRICTS HAVE AN EXEMPTION

02:31:10.361 --> 02:31:11.729
INTENDED FOR AGRICULTURAL

02:31:11.796 --> 02:31:14.098
PURPOSES. BUT IS BEING EXPLOITED

02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:16.367
BY MOBILE FEELERS WHO USE PICKUP

02:31:16.434 --> 02:31:18.436
TRUCKS TO DELIVER FUEL. THE

02:31:18.502 --> 02:31:19.437
SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY

02:31:19.503 --> 02:31:20.871
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT RECENTLY

02:31:20.938 --> 02:31:22.206
FOUND THAT THESE OPERATORS ARE

02:31:22.273 --> 02:31:24.909
AT LEAST FIFTY TIMES WORSE FOR

02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:26.510
THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THEY ARE

02:31:26.577 --> 02:31:28.913
ABLE TO OPERATE FREELY. IN SHORT

02:31:28.979 --> 02:31:30.781
THE CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

02:31:30.848 --> 02:31:32.082
HAS CREATED A COUNTERINTUITIVE

02:31:32.149 --> 02:31:33.651
SCENARIO WHERE COMPANIES ARE

02:31:33.717 --> 02:31:35.352
INCENTIVIZED TO OPERATE IN A

02:31:35.419 --> 02:31:36.720
LESS SAFE AND FAR MORE

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:38.456
ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL MANNER.

02:31:38.522 --> 02:31:39.890
BECAUSE THEY CAN ESCAPE

02:31:39.957 --> 02:31:41.792
REGULATION WHEREAS COMPANIES.

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:43.093
THAT WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:44.428
MOBILE FEELING IS THAT SAFE AND

02:31:44.495 --> 02:31:46.197
IS RESPONSIBLE AS POSSIBLE ARE

02:31:46.263 --> 02:31:47.965
BLOCKED FROM OPERATING. THIS

02:31:48.032 --> 02:31:48.833
BILL WOULD RAISE THE

02:31:48.899 --> 02:31:49.900
ENVIRONMENTAL BAR FOR ALL

02:31:49.967 --> 02:31:51.635
COMPANIES BUT IMPORTANTLY THAT

02:31:51.702 --> 02:31:53.070
ALSO PRESERVES THE AUTHORITY OF

02:31:53.137 --> 02:31:54.338
EACH THEIR DISTRICT TO IMPOSE

02:31:54.405 --> 02:31:56.073

THEIR DISTRICTS SPECIFIC NEEDS

02:32:00.845 --> 02:32:02.446

JUST TELL HARPER ONE COMMENT I

03:28:58.726 --> 03:29:00.461
THINK WE ACTUALLY- CLOSER THAN

03:29:00.527 --> 03:29:01.896
IT APPEARED FROM OUR COMMENTS I

03:29:01.962 --> 03:29:03.097
THINK BECAUSE WE WANT TO

03:29:03.163 --> 03:29:04.431
EXHAUST. THE LOCAL REMEDIES TO

03:29:04.498 --> 03:29:05.766
AND GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE

03:29:05.833 --> 03:29:07.534
PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL UNDER

03:29:07.601 --> 03:29:08.402
SEQUEL- BEFORE THAT THIS WOULD

03:29:08.469 --> 03:29:10.638
EVEN- TAKE PLACE THAT THE ACTION

03:29:10.704 --> 03:29:12.539
THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE HA. AND

03:29:12.606 --> 03:29:14.341
FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ON A CORTES

03:29:14.408 --> 03:29:16.176
OF THIS THAT'S WHAT WE ALREADY

03:29:16.243 --> 03:29:17.811
KNOW THAT. YOU CAN'T HAVE AN

03:29:17.878 --> 03:29:18.412
EXEMPTION WAS GONNA LITIGATE

03:29:18.479 --> 03:29:20.180
THAT FOR EXAMPLE SO I THINK

03:29:20.247 --> 03:29:21.849
THERE IS. THE POTENTIAL FOR MANY

03:29:21.916 --> 03:29:23.183
OF THE MINES HERE. MISTER SEG.

03:29:23.250 --> 03:29:27.922
I'M SORRY. THAT COMMENT- THE

03:29:27.988 --> 03:29:30.858
FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE A COURT

03:29:30.925 --> 03:29:32.526
DECISION IN THE MIDDLE OF SICK

03:29:32.593 --> 03:29:35.229
BOY IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME-

03:29:35.296 --> 03:29:38.132

THAT WE HAVE THAT THE OPPOSITION

03:29:40.567 --> 03:29:43.103
IT WAS STATED SO. GOING BACK TO

PROVIDED A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT

03:29:48.275 --> 03:29:49.576
THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED I THINK

03:29:49.643 --> 03:29:52.413
THAT AGAIN I AM CERTAIN THAT

03:29:52.479 --> 03:29:56.417

03:34:12.873 --> 03:34:15.375
PLAY- CREATING THE NEED FOR THIS

03:34:15.442 --> 03:34:17.077
BILL FIRST IS THE LOWEST INCOME

03:34:17.144 --> 03:34:18.579
DRIVERS WHO ARE BURNING THE MOST

03:34:18.645 --> 03:34:21.315
GASOLINE ARE SPENDING UPWARDS OF

03:34:21.381 --> 03:34:23.684
25% OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON

03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:25.686
THEIR VEHICLE FUEL- AND THEN

03:34:25.752 --> 03:34:28.989
SECOND- WE'VE GOT A CLIMATE

03:34:29.056 --> 03:34:30.123
CRISIS. BURNING GASOLINE AND

03:34:30.190 --> 03:34:31.391
LIGHT DUTY CARS AND TRUCKS AS

03:34:31.458 --> 03:34:33.227
THE SINGLE BIGGEST SOURCE OF

03:34:33.293 --> 03:34:34.294
CARBON EMISSIONS AND CURRENT ZAB

03:34:34.361 --> 03:34:36.096
INCENTIVES HAVE NOT BROUGHT OUR

03:34:36.163 --> 03:34:37.831
GASOLINE CONSUMPTION DOWN WE'VE

03:34:37.898 --> 03:34:39.533
STAYED AT FIFTEEN BILLION

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:41.535
GALLONS A YEAR. IN CALIFORNIA

03:34:41.602 --> 03:34:43.670
FOR THE LAST DECADE- AND THEN

03:34:43.737 --> 03:34:45.939
FINALLY WE REACHED A POINT WHERE

03:34:46.006 --> 03:34:47.541
OTHERS HAVE MARKET IS NO LONGER

03:34:47.608 --> 03:34:49.710
NEW IT'S MATURE IN FACT THE

03:34:49.776 --> 03:34:51.812
DEMAND FOR JOBS IS EXCEEDING

03:34:51.878 --> 03:34:53.347
SUPPLY AND WE'RE ACTUALLY IN AS

03:34:53.413 --> 03:34:55.649
THEY HAVE SHORTAGE- SO THESE

03:34:55.716 --> 03:34:57.150
THREE FACTORS GASOLINE BURDEN

03:34:57.217 --> 03:35:00.020
FAMILIES. THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND

03:35:00.087 --> 03:35:02.155
THE ZIP SHORTAGE REQUIRED THAT

03:35:02.222 --> 03:35:06.226
WE REFORM EVEY INCENTIVES- AND-

03:35:06.293 --> 03:35:08.462
SO WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO

03:35:08.528 --> 03:35:10.197
KEEP INCENTIVIZING THE WEALTHIER

03:35:10.264 --> 03:35:12.099
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T USING MUCH

03:35:12.165 --> 03:35:14.268
GASOLINE TO SWITCH TO THE US-

03:35:14.334 --> 03:35:16.570
BUT WE DO NEED TO MAXIMIZE

03:35:16.637 --> 03:35:18.939
EMISSIONS CUTS BY FOCUSING ON-

03:35:19.006 --> 03:35:20.507
FOLKS WHO ARE USING IT BUT

03:35:20.574 --> 03:35:22.042
DRIVING THE MOST USING THE MOST

03:35:22.109 --> 03:35:24.378
GASOLINE. AND WE DO NEED TO

03:35:24.444 --> 03:35:25.612
MAXIMIZE EQUITY BY FOCUSING ON

03:35:25.679 --> 03:35:27.414
THE LOW INCOME DRIVERS WHO ARE

03:35:27.481 --> 03:35:29.316
BURNING THE MOST GASOLINE AND WE

03:35:29.383 --> 03:35:32.019
ALSO MAKE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:35:32.085 --> 03:35:33.220
THESE SCARCE ZAB THE SCARE

03:35:33.287 --> 03:35:34.254
SUPPLIED ZEDD'S GETS INTO THE

03:35:34.321 --> 03:35:36.823
HANDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE

03:35:36.890 --> 03:35:37.858
USING IT TO DISPLACE THE MOST

03:35:37.924 --> 03:35:40.327
GASOLINE- SO THINK ABOUT IT THIS

03:35:40.394 --> 03:35:42.195
WAY IF WE COULD GET THE BIGGEST

03:35:42.262 --> 03:35:44.131
GASOLINE USERS INTO STEPS. FIRST

03:35:44.197 --> 03:35:45.966
IT WOULD TAKE NINE MILLION STEPS

03:35:46.033 --> 03:35:48.135
ON THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA TO CUT

03:35:48.201 --> 03:35:50.170
VEHICLE EMISSIONS IN HALF. AND

03:35:50.237 --> 03:35:51.972
IF AS CURRENT TRENDS ARE BEARING

03:35:52.039 --> 03:35:54.074
OUT THESE BIGGEST USERS ARE THE

03:35:54.141 --> 03:35:55.575
LAST PEOPLE TO SWITCH DESERVES

03:35:55.642 --> 03:35:57.544
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US TWENTY

03:35:57.611 --> 03:35:59.646
FOUR MILLION ZAB ON THE ROAD SO

03:35:59.713 --> 03:36:04.484
NEARLY THREE TIMES AS MANY- AND

03:36:04.551 --> 03:36:05.319
THERE'S ANOTHER BENEFIT OUT FOR

03:36:05.385 --> 03:36:07.120
THESE BIGGEST GASOLINE USERS. IF

03:36:07.187 --> 03:36:08.722
THEY HAVE ENOUGH OF AN INCENTIVE

03:36:08.789 --> 03:36:10.457
TO SWITCH TO A STEP THEY WILL BE

03:36:10.524 --> 03:36:11.258
ADDITIONALLY SAVING A LOT OF

03:36:11.325 --> 03:36:13.126
MONEY SO THE BIGGEST USERS ARE

03:36:13.193 --> 03:36:14.628
SPENDING. AROUND SIX THOUSAND

03:36:14.695 --> 03:36:18.999
DOLLARS A YEAR ON- ON THEIR-VEHICLE THAT FUEL SO IF THEY

03:36:19.066 --> 03:36:20.701
SWITCHED IS ABSENT THEY COULD

03:36:20.767 --> 03:36:22.436
SAVE. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A

03:36:22.502 --> 03:36:23.403
MONTH AND THEY COULD USE THAT

03:36:23.470 --> 03:36:25.205
MONEY TO MAKE THEIR MONTHLY

03:36:25.272 --> 03:36:27.007
PAYMENTS ON THEIR EVEY- SO WE

03:36:27.074 --> 03:36:28.508
GOT A LOT OF BENEFITS HERE THAT

03:36:28.575 --> 03:36:30.077
ONE'S NOT COMING FROM TAXPAYER

03:36:30.143 --> 03:36:32.579
DOLLARS- SO IN SHORT. THIS

03:36:32.646 --> 03:36:35.015
PROGRAM MAXIMIZES EMISSIONS CUTS

03:36:35.082 --> 03:36:36.516
AND HELPS THE DRIVERS WHO NEED

03:36:36.583 --> 03:36:38.318
IT THE MOST SO I URGE YOU TO

I DO APPRECIATE THEIR APPROACH I

03:39:37.631 --> 03:39:38.899
JUST HAVE A QUESTION THERE'S NO

03:39:38.965 --> 03:39:40.200
- THERE'S LANGUAGE ABOUT

03:39:40.267 --> 03:39:42.536
PRIORITIZING- LOW TO MODERATE

03:39:42.602 --> 03:39:44.170
INCOME INDIVIDUALS BUT THERE'S

03:39:44.237 --> 03:39:46.740
NO REQUIREMENTS. ON ON INCOME

03:39:46.806 --> 03:39:50.110
WITHIN IN THE PAST THAT THAT'S

03:39:50.176 --> 03:39:51.177
BEEN A PROBLEM. CAN YOU TALK A

03:39:51.244 --> 03:39:52.812
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND ARE

03:39:52.879 --> 03:39:54.748
YOU LOOKING TO ADDRESS THAT ARE

03:39:54.814 --> 03:40:00.754
. HOW DO WE- YEAH. SO WHAT WE

03:40:00.820 --> 03:40:02.689
DEFINITELY WANT TO DO IS MOVED

03:40:02.756 --> 03:40:04.624
THE INCENTIVES TO LOW TO

03:40:04.691 --> 03:40:06.526
MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES THAT'S

03:40:06.593 --> 03:40:07.861
UP INCLUDE LANGUAGE WE DID NOT

03:40:07.928 --> 03:40:10.864
PUT A SPECIFIC INCOME CAP I

03:40:10.931 --> 03:40:11.431
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

03:40:11.498 --> 03:40:13.199
WE'RE CONTEMPLATING AS WE AS WE

03:40:13.266 --> 03:40:15.902
MOVE FORWARD JUST TO MAKE IT A

03:40:15.969 --> 03:40:16.503
LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR BUT THE

03:40:16.570 --> 03:40:18.705
IDEA IS DEFINITELY TO HAVE THE

03:40:18.772 --> 03:40:21.541
INCENTIVES- BE MUCH MORE FOCUSED

03:40:21.608 --> 03:40:23.343
FOR TO BE FOCUS PERIOD ON LOW TO

03:40:23.410 --> 03:40:25.812
MODERATE CAN FAMILIES AND

BILL TODAY. BUT AS THIS BILL

03:40:31.952 --> 03:40:34.354
MOVES FORWARD. I DO THINK WE

03:40:34.421 --> 03:40:35.655
NEED TO BE INTENTIONAL AND HAVE

03:40:35.722 --> 03:40:37.991
CLEAR PROTECTIONS ON. ON INCOME

03:40:38.058 --> 03:40:39.426
