I MENTIONED WHEN WE DEBATED THE BUDGET THIS YEAR THAT WE HAD MORE PORK IN THE STATE BUDGET THIS YEAR THAN IN ANY OTHER YEAR I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE BUDGET IN MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS TRAILER BILL CONTINUES THAT TRADITION THERE'S BEEN RESEARCH AROUND THE WORLD THAT'S PROVEN CONCLUSIVELY THAT LEGISLATIVE YOUR MARKS ARE NOT IN THE PUBLIC'S BEST INTEREST IN FACT WHAT'S BEST TO DO IS TO ALLOCATE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF MONEY.

THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MS MELENDEZ YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MY QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR.

THIS MELENDEZ THANK YOU SO WHEN WE HAVE THE BUDGET HEARING YESTERDAY AND I ASKED THIS QUESTION THERE SEEM TO BE WELL THERE WEREN'T A WHOLE LOT OF ANSWERS I UNDERSTAND THIS WAS A PRIORITY THAT CAME FROM THE SENATE. BUT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. I SAYS TO HELP HEALTH CENTERS TO PROVIDE ABORTION SERVICES IN MAY BE THE TARGETS OF VIOLENCE AND VANDALISM IT DOESN'T SAY THOUGH HOW THEY'RE REQUIRED TO SPEND THE MONEY UP ADMINISTRATIVE COST. IT'S VERY BROAD AND VAGUE AND I'M ON I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE SENDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FIND. PLANNED PARENTHOOD IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO GO FOR SECURITY.

IT ENABLES TRANSFERS OF VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE MADE IN PREVIOUS YEARS OUT OF THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THE B. S. A. N. INTO THE NEWLY CREATED BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT THE B. D. S. A- AND ALTHOUGH THESE TWO FUNDS HAVE VERY SIMILAR NAMES. THEY WERE CREATED IN VERY DISSIMILAR WAYS AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT RESTRICTIONS THE B. D. S. A IT WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND HAS NO RESTRICTIONS ON HOW IT CAN BE USED THE B. S. A. WAS KEY CREATED BY THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT HAS SOME PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON HOW CAN BE USED AMONG THEM THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR MUST HAVE A FINDING A FISCAL EMERGENCY BEFORE FUNDS MAY BE TRANSFERRED. I BELIEVE THAT UNABLE IN THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS OUT OF A RESTRICTED ACCOUNT INTO AN. UNRESTRICTED ACCOUNT IS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT ARGENEAU VOTE.

THE LARGEST ITEM IN THERE'S A PROVIDES THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SPECIAL DEPOSIT FUND YOUR CALL THAT THIS WAS SETTLEMENT MONEY FROM THE PREVIOUS ATTORNEY GENERAL SUIT WITH ALL THE LENDERS DURING THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS THIS HOUSING TRUST FUND WILL BE USED TO SERVICE TENANTS AS WELL AS HOMEOWNERS AND WE DO GROUP TO BELIEVE. THAT THIS WILL HOPEFULLY RESOLVE THE LEGAL ISSUE THAT WAS LITIGATED THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN ADDITION PROVIDES A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO STUDY HOW TO ESTABLISH AND MANAGE A TRUST. FOR THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT IT ALSO AUTHORIZES THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS OR FISCAL AGENT OF A MULTI AGENCY WORKING GROUP TO REQUEST FUNDING TO DEVELOP AND ACCELERATE IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION DOCUMENT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS READ. AND WITHOUT A RESPECT FOR US FOR I BUILT ON SB ONE THIRTY. THANKS FOR STAYING. THE TROUBLED MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THIRTEEN IS THE CHAIR MENTION THIS BILL CREATES A TRUST TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT. THE STATE HAS WAGED A MULTI YEAR EFFORT TO PREVENT PAYING THIS MONEY OUT TO THE BENEFICIARIES FOR WHOM IT WAS INTENDED THOSE BEING. OF MORTGAGE HOLDERS AND FISCAL DISTRESS THAT ARE FACING TO FORECLOSURE I AM BEYOND HAPPY THAT WE ARE FINALLY GETTING AROUND TO PUTTING THAT MONEY TO THE USE IT WAS INTENDED. HOWEVER I DO HAVE A CONCERN AND ALTHOUGH I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL I WANTED TO RAISE IT HERE AND THAT IS THAT THIS BILL ALSO CONTAINS INTENT LANGUAGE. AS TO HOW THOSE TRUST FUNDS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AND AMONG THE TEN LANGUAGES SAYS THAT IT'S GOING TO GO TO AID. HOMEOWNERS AND WHO ARE FACING FORECLOSURE WHICH IS APPROPRIATE BUT ALSO SAYS THAT IT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED FOR LEGAL AID TO RENTERS AND ALTHOUGH THAT MIGHT BE A WORTHY CAUSE. THAT IS NOT AMONGST THE USES TO WHICH THE ORIGINAL SUBTLE AGREEMENT SAID THAT IT COULD BE PUT SO WE HAVE JUST FINISHED SPENDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY. ON THIS FRUITLESS LAWSUIT TO PREVENT PAYING THIS MONEY I WOULD HATE FOR US TO WIND UP IN COURT AGAIN WHICH IS WHAT I FEAR WILL HAPPEN. IF WE TRY TO USE THIS MONEY FOR A PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS NOT INTENDED ON THE RIDDLE SETTLEMENT BUT HAVING SAID THAT I. ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB ONE FIFTEEN. THERE WAS OBERNOLTE SAYING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE STIR TING YOU MAY CLOSE WE WISH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

MR TANK THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AB ONE FIFTEEN IS A BILL THAT RE AUTHORIZES ATTACKS ON MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS BUT UNLIKE MANY OTHER TAX IS A TAX THAT'S FULLY SUPPORTED BY OUR HEALTH PLANS HOPEFULLY YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE LETTERS SO ISSUING THEIR SUPPORT AND THE REASON THAT IS IT ALLOWS US TO DOUBLE THE REVENUE THAT WE GET FROM THIS TAX. FROM FEDERAL MEDICAID DOLLARS AND USE IT TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL MEDICAID PROGRAM SO THEREFORE THE NEW TAXES ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN A GENERAL FUND SAVINGS IS SCHEDULED FOR THE SAVINGS OF OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS RESOURCES THAT WILL BE SORELY NEEDED TO REALLY SUPPORT. OUR HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. AGAIN. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS WHO WERE HERE. IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS WERE WE ACTUALLY. DID DO THE MCO TAX THIS IS JUST A RENEWAL OF THAT PREVIOUS PROPOSAL THIS ALLOW US UP TO ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR THAT AUTHORITY AGAIN WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON AB ONE FIFTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER OVER MULTI MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB ONE FIFTEEN I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THE CHAMBERS AWARE OF HOW THESE TAXES ON MANAGEDCARE ORGANIZATIONS WORK. WE IMPOSE A TAX ON POLICIES THAT IS MOST HEAVILY TARGETED AT MEDI CAL INSURANCE PLANS AND BECAUSE OF THE STATE ONLY PAYS HALF OF THOSE PREMIUMS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS THE OTHER HALF. THAT RESULTS IN NET REVENUE TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND AND IS THE CHAIR SAID THAT'S GOING TO BE A JUST UNDER TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE A YEAR. HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FREE TAX AND ALTHOUGH THIS WILL RESULT. IN A STATE BUDGET SURPLUS THAT IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER IT WILL ALSO REDUCE IN A FIT RICH RESULT IN A FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT THAT IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER. I ALSO AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FEDERAL LAW PREVENTS US FROM SPECIFICALLY TARGETING MEDI CAL INSURANCE PLANS SO THE TAX HAS TO BE APPLIED MORE BROADLY AND THAT'S GOING TO RESULT. IN AN UNREIMBURSED TAX LIABILITY BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WILL BE BORNE. BY THE POLICY HOLDERS OF COMMERCIAL POLICIES IN THE FORM OF HIGHER HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS ON THOSE POLICIES NOW WHEN WE ENACTED THIS TAX SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WE ENACTED ALSO CONTEMPORARY DAIS CHANGES TO THE STATE CORPORATE TAX CODE THAT WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS ON THOSE SAME POLICIES IN A WAY. IN A IN A ATTEMPT TO HOLD THOSE POLICY HOLDERS HARMLESS I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT WAS NOT DONE THIS YEAR SO THOSE POLICY HOLDERS ARE GOING TO BEAR THE BRUNT. OF THAT ADDITIONAL UNREIMBURSED. TAX LIABILITY FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE SAYING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM MISTER TING YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MY FOR MUCH JUST TO CLARIFY MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS YES. THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN MONTHLY PREMIUMS THE ESTIMATE. IS ABOUT FIVE TO TEN CENTS.

MR OF ANTI THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE EIGHTEEN AS A CHAIR MENTIONED THIS TRAILER BILL RATIFIES NEW MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THIRTEEN DIFFERENT STATE EMPLOYEE BARGAINING UNITS. THAT GRANTS THEM GENERAL SORRY FUND INCREASES OF BETWEEN TWO AND A QUARTER IN THREE POINT 75% PER YEAR THESE ARE IN LINE WITH INFLATION AND THEREFORE THESE MO USE ARE SUPPORTABLE. HOWEVER I HAVE TO RAISE A CONCERN OF THAT I HAVE WITH THE BARGAINING PROCESS THIS YEAR. STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT COMPENSATION STUDIES BE DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BEFORE SITTING DOWN WITH THE BARGAINING UNITS TO NEGOTIATE THE AMMO USE AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS DONE THIS YEAR THE AMMO USED DO NOT APPEAR TO REFLECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPENSATION STUDIES. IN SOME CATION THOSE COMPENSATION STUDIES INDICATED THAT JOB CLASSIFICATIONS WERE UNDER COMPENSATED IN SOME THEY INDICATED THAT THEY WERE OVER COMPENSATED HOWEVER THESE CLASSIFICATIONS WERE ALL ASSIGNED TO THE SAME MODEST GENERAL CELL INCREASES AS ALL THE REST. OF THE CLASSIFICATIONS IN THEIR BARGAINING UNITS SO OBVIOUSLY IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT TAKE THE TIME AND GO TO THE TROUBLE OF DOING THAT THESE CLASSIFICATION SURVEYS WE SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE NEGOTIATE THE MO USE. SO I AM IN HOPES THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN THE NEXT TIME TO DO OF SITS. DOWN BUT ARE THESE ARE MORE USER SUPPORTABLE IRISH AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL SEE.

AND SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION SENTIMENTS WERE CRAFTED WITH SIGNIFICANT INPUT BY BAY AREA LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING WITHOUT CREATING A NEW BUREAUCRACY AND SURE THAT MOST FUNDS GO DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES AND CITIES ARE CAPABLE SPENDING THAT. AND PROVIDE THE RIGHT ARRAY OF FUNDRAISING TOOLS FOR THE REGION WANT TO THANK BOTH BAY AREA REGIONAL BODIES OF VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS AMENDED AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR CHIU MS BAUER K. HANNYA RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I RISE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. I DIDN'T OPPOSE THE BILL WHEN IT WAS IN OUR HOUSE THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE I WAS IN. GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THIS TAX MEASURE GOES ON TARA BALLOT THAT ALL THE CITIES IN THE REGION. BENEFITS THERE'S A RETURN OF THOSE TAX DOLLARS TO OUR TAX PAYERS. AND DESPITE ALL THE WORK AND AFTER WENT THROUGH THE TWO BODIES WHICH LIKE THE AUTHOR SAID SUPPORTED IT. I'M AT THIS POINT THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL ARE. FORTHCOMING THAT THE FUNDS WILL OF MY CONSTITUENTS WILL PAY THESE TAXES. AND THEY WILL SEE NO RETURN OF THAT INVESTMENT IN THEIR CITIES. IN EACH OF OUR CITIES WILL CONTINUE TO GET RAIN ALLOCATIONS. BUT THE LARGER CITIES WILL GET A RETURN ON THOSE FUNDS AND THE SMALLER CITIES WILL NOT. AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO TAX OUR CONSTITUENTS. UNLESS WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS OVERSIGHT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND OUR CONSTITUENCY RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHICH THIS BIT THIS MEASURE WILL NOT DO IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE SMALL CITIES I REPRESENTS THE NO RETURN ON THOSE DOLLARS.

AND IT'S GOING TO ALLOW WHAT FROM WHAT I CAN SEE TAXES RAISED IN DUBLIN DANVILLE LAFAYETTE TO BE SPENT IN URBAN SAN FRANCISCO SO SHE MAKES A VERY VALID POINT THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS TAX AND IF YOU THINK THAT. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A TEMPLATE FOR YOUR DISTRICT THEN YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE IT EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SO I WOULD CAUTION YOU. TO LOOK AT THIS YOU MAY SEE THIS AS JUST SORT OF A DISTRICT BELL BUT IT'S GOING TO BE COMING TO A DISTRICT NEAR YOU. IF YOU IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND ALLOW IT TO FLOURISH I WOULD URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT. MR GRAYSON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR PLEASE. IF I MAKE WITHOUT OBJECTION LIST AUTHOR OF. JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BASED ON SOME THINGS CONCERNS THAT I ALSO SHARED WHEN THIS BILL FIRST CAME OUT AND THEN ALSO WORKED WITH WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON I DO WANT TO CLARIFICATION AS FAR AS A RETURN TO SOURCE THAT WAS A VERY SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME BEING FROM THE EAST BAY AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT YOU DID WORK INTO YOUR BILL A RETURN TO SOURCE. PRINCIPLE OR OR PARTY YOUR BILL ABSOLUTELY AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A MISUNDERSTANDING SO WE AMENDED THE BILL SO THAT 80% OF THE FUNDS RAISED BY ANY COUNTY WILL GO BACK TO THAT COUNTY BECAUSE OF THE VERY CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE HEARD. FROM A NUMBER OF FOLKS SO WANT TO JUST MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR ON THIS BILL ALSO ALLOWS ANY COUNTY TO OPT OUT OF BEING PART OF A NINE COUNTY BAY AREA FUNDING MECHANISM SO IF IT'S PROPOSED ANY COUNTY INCLUDING YOURS CAN DECIDE THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN EITHER THE RAISING OF NEW REVENUES. OR THE DISPERSED. OF THOSE NEW REVENUES. MR RACING YEAH ONE MORE QUESTION IF POSSIBLE IN THAT. CASE AND THIS IS ONLY A RESTORATION. IS GENERALLY DO NOT OKAY THANK YOU COLLOQUY. MR CHIU MAY EMPLOY FIVE HIS REMARKS. TO ADDRESS ANY ANIMAL I'M HAPPY OF MR GRISSOM LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION THROUGH THE SPEAKER. IF YOU LIKE TO DO THAT. MISS RACING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD THE. HE CAN. ADDRESSES IN CLOSING REMARKS THIS BILL IS SIMPLY OF. A WAY TO PUT THE- THE VOTE TO THE VOTERS OR PUT THE MEASURE TO THE VOTERS IS AS FAR AS A TAX AND THAT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY VOTING ON THE TAX TODAY. THE RESTORATION MISTER CHIU MAY ADDRESS THAT IN HIS CLOTHES WE HAVE ONGOING DEBATE MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS A REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE FOR IT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB PORCINI SEVEN. TO SAY THE BAY AREA'S EXPERIENCE BECAUSE SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS. IS A SEVERE UNDERSTATEMENT THE REALITY IS THAT THE SHORTFALL AND OF THE- AFFECTS OF THAT ARE FELT IN EVERY CORNER. OF THE BAY AREA SAN JOSE MEASURE AREA DOES NOT THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKET IN THE NATION WITH MEDIAN HOME PRICES AT OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLION. DOLLARS A HOME. NOW WE KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSING CRISIS EVEN WE TALK REGIONALLY IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST WHAT ONE CITY DOES IT HAS TO BE TREATED AS A REGIONAL ISSUE. I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE ALLOWS A LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DECIDE LOCALVOTERS TO DECIDE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS TO WORK TOGETHER ON REGIONAL BOARDS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD HOUSING BECAUSE- AS WE HEARD YESTERDAY. DURING THE DEBATE EVERYONE SEEMS TO AGREE THAT WE NEED TO START BUILDING MORE HOUSING THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL FOR US TO IS TO DO THAT EVEN MORE SO THAN WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING. AND FRANKLY WHEN SAN JOSE BILLS AND SAM CISCO BILLS THAT DOESN'T JUST HELP SAN JOSE AND SAN FRANCISCO IT HELPS ALL JURISDICTIONS ESPECIALLY THOSE JURISDICTIONS BUT REFUSED TO BUILD THEY ALSO BENEFIT WHAT OTHER CITIES BUILD AND SO I URGE. COLLEAGUES TO ALLOW OUR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO DEAL. WITH THE MOST SEVERE HOPPING CRISIS IN THE NATION. THANK YOU MUCH KALRA SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ADAM MISTER CHU YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SEVEN REYES AND SALAMI ANSWER THE QUESTION FROM A COLLEAGUE FROM CONCORD. SO THE WAY THIS% PROCESS WORKS IS AS WE HAVE DONE IS A REGION. IN THE BAY AREA WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPORTATION FUNDING AS WE'VE DONE FOR BAY AREA RESTORATION. WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY'S TO AUTHORIZE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BAY AREA REGION COULD CONSIDER REVENUE MEASURES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET APPROVAL FOR JUST PUT ON THE BALLOT. THEY HAVE TO GET APPROVAL FOR IT NOT JUST BY ONE BUT ACTUALLY TO REGIONAL BODIES IN THE BAY AREA.

SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY SIX BY CENTER WIENER ANOTHER'S AN ACCOLADE SYNCING. SIR KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. TODAY I RISE AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY SIX. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW BY NOW SB ONE THIRTY SIX REPEALS THE ONE YEAR PRIOR FELONY SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT FOR MANY BUT LOW LEVEL FELONY OFFENSES IT EXCLUDES WHEN YOU'RE HAS IS BEING SERVED AT COUNTY JAILS. ARE THE BILL ONLY REPEALS WHEN YOUR ENHANCEMENT. FOR LOW LEVEL OFFENSES IS NOT APPLIED AS TIME SERVED IN COUNTY JAILS. AS A FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER W. DEFENDER LEVIN YEARS. I HAVE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE REGARDING THIS ENHANCEMENT. WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCE IS NOT DISSIMILAR TO WHAT RESEARCH AND STATISTICS HAVE SHOWN. THAT THIS ENHANCEMENT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY USED AGAINST PERSONS OF COLOR AND THOSE WERE LOW INCOME. IN FACT THIS ENHANCEMENT IS BETTER DESCRIBED AS TOP ON TIME SERVED RATHER THAN TOUGH ON CRIME WHICH EXACERBATES EXISTING RACIAL AND SOCIO ECONOMIC DISPARITIES THAT PERSIST WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT IS A RELIC OF OUR STATE STARK HISTORY OF PURSUING MASS INCARCERATION AS A MEANS OF COMBATING CRIME. IS UNNECESSARY AND INEFFECTIVE A ABILITY OF CHEAP OF GB REHABILITATION BUT IT DOES TO GIVE US COMFORT. IN COMBATING CRIME AND CONTRARY TO WHAT IS BEING ARE YOU BY THE OPPOSITION THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE TOOLS PROSECUTORS MAY USE SB ONE THIRTY SIX WILL NOT PRECLUDE ENHANCEMENTS FOR PEOPLE CONVICTED OF FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARMED ROBBERY. OF A RAPE OF A CHILD AS OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WOULD LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE THESE REMAIN APPLICABLE OTHER AS MISALIGNED OF THOSE EXTREMELY SERIOUS CRIMES. AND THIS PARTICULAR BILL ALSO EXCLUDES. TONY SEXUAL CRIMES AS WELL. SO FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA HAS SENDS ENHANCES SPECIFIC TO REPEAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE RAPE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND MANY MANY OTHER SERIOUS OFFENSES MOREOVER. IN ADDITION TO THOSE DISPERSE CLIENTS SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENTS CALIFORNIA HAS A CATCH ALL THREE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT FOR REPEAT VIOLENT FELONY OFFENDERS ON A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT REPEAT SERIAL TONY EVENT A SERIOUS FELONY OFFENDERS. AND I THE THREE YEAR AND HAS BEEN OR THE FIVE YEAR AND HAS A CAN BE COMBINED WITH THE ONE YEAR AND HAS WITH THAT AS TWO ONE THREE SIX. SIX TO REPEAL. ON TOP OF THAT PROSECUTORS STILL HAVE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS TO CHOOSE FROM AND SENTENCED A REPEAT OFFENDER. REPEALING THIS INEFFECTIVE AND COMMONLY USED ONE YEAR SENTENCE AND HANDSOME WITH SAVE OUR STATE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR IMPOSE. WHILE ENSURING THAT EACH PERSON IS TREATED ACT REALLY UNDER THE LAW WITHOUT SACRIFICING JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OR PUBLIC SAFETY. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED SERVING THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT TAXPAYERS. ARE PUTTING A BILL ACCESS ONE BILLION. SB ONE THIRTY SIX ENDS THIS MASS INCARCERATION APPROACH FOR LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND DISPROPORTIONATE HURTS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME. COMMUNITIES IT IS A SLEDGEHAMMER APPROACH A SENTENCING THAT. AS OPPOSED TO A SCALPEL APPROACH AND ACTUALLY HAS A PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME AND IT IS AN ENHANCEMENT THAT IS USED. BROADLY AND CLEARLY USED AGAINST THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY ARE. VICTIMIZED BY A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS SHOWN IMPLICIT BIAS BUT OVER THE DECADES SO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT REMOVING. THIS PARTICULAR ENHANCEMENT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY TAKE AWAY TOOLS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PUNISHMENT FITS THE CRIME FOR ANY GIVEN CONVICTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MISTER. I THANK. YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB ONE THIRTY SIX THIS BILL CONTINUES A TREND OF REMOVING PROTECTIONS FOR LAW ABIDING CALIFORNIANS WHILE ALLOWING THOSE ALREADY CONVICTED OF A FELONY TO ESCAPE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS SB ONE THIRTY SIX WILL ALLOW THOSE CONVICTED WITH A HISTORY OF REPEATED FELONIES TO BE TREATED LIKE FIRST TIME OFFENDERS THIS BILL ENDS ONE YEAR SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS FOR CONVICTED CRIMINALS WHO CO. COMMITTED MULTIPLE FELONIES. YES A FENCE WAS CONSIDERED NON VIOLENT THIS IS. AND HAS BEEN IS AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SEVERITY OF MULTIPLE FELONIES EXAMPLES OF VIOLENT CRIMES WHERE THE ONE YEAR HAS NO WE REMOVED BY SB ONE THREE SIX INCLUDE LEWD ACTS ON A CHILD UNDER FOURTEEN WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION FOR CHILD ENDANGERMENT IN FORCIBLE RAPE WITH PYRE. FICTION FOR ELDER ABUSE. THE LOSERS OF THIS BILL ARE THE- THOSE AFFECTED BY VIOLENT CRIME WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO REMOVE PROTECTIONS FOR THE PUBLIC AN EXPECTED JUSTICE TO BE SERVED I URGE IN OF A- THANK YOU MISTER FONG MR CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MISTER CAMPAIGN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FROM A DENSE FRICKER I WANT TO THANK THE SCENT OF HER PHONE SAN FRANCISCO FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE. FULL JOCKEY THIS ON OUR FLOOR WHILE IT IS A GREAT IT IS REALLY GREAT THAT WE WORK TO REFORM OR- A JEW JUSTICE SYSTEM I THINK MORE COMPETITION NEED TO HAPPEN AROUND WHAT. WE SHOULD DO WITH THE MONEY WE SAVED FROM THESE REFORMS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INVEST IN SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS ALL OF PRISON TO HELP THEM TO GET BACK TO THEIR FEET AND NOT. RE OFFEND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH ANYONE MY COLLEAGUES. WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING OR THE SAVING FROM THE JUST A RIFF ON BE SPENT ON THOSE. LOOKING TO RESTART THEIR LIVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR GRAY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I ROCK MUSICIAN. AND I WANT TO LOOK AT THIS FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN WHAT I'VE JUST HEARD ON THIS FOR WHICH IN FACT. DOES THIS PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY. WITHIN THE SENTENCING. WORLD I THINK IT DOES. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE- TRIAL OF DEFENSIVE GOT THREE SIX NINE YEAR. SENTENCE POSSIBILITIES YOU CAN ADD ENHANCEMENT. ON THE LOW TERM VERSUS THE MID TERM YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PROSECUTORS. SIMPLY MORE RETICENT. TO FIND THOSE DEALS AND SO. I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO DISCRETION FLEXIBILITY THAT'S BEEN THE DIRECTION OF THIS FOR THIS BODY. I THINK THE INTENT THIS AUTHOR MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BUT I THINK IN PRACTICE. WE'RE MOVING IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THAT WE'VE ALL WORK SO HARD INCOME JUST FOR SO. RESPECTFULLY AGAIN ALL CONTENT IS I THINK YOU'RE GOOD. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS AND THE PRACTICAL FACT. AND VOTE NO TODAY ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER GRAHAM MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I'M READING A LETTER FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THAT CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS PRESENTED ON THIS BILL THIS IS NOT IS NOT LIMITED TO. NON SERIOUS NON VIOLENT CRIMES ACCORDING TO THE LA DISTRICT ATTORNEY SB ONE THREE SIX WILL ELIMINATE THE ONE HERE IN HAND SPENT FOR REPEAT FELONS FOR PRIOR SUCH AS FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR FELONY CHILD ABUSE. COLLEAGUES THESE ARE NOT NON SERIOUS NON VIOLENT CRIMES. AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW OUR. EFFORTS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM BUT WE CAN'T TAKE AWAY THE TOOLS FROM PROSECUTORS TO EXERCISE OF DISCRETION TO FILE THESE ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENTS YOU KNOW FOR CAREER CRIMINALS THESE ARE THE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOCKING UP AND KEEP AN EYE OUT OF THAT THE PUBLIC FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. YOU KNOW LET'S NOT LOSE OUR CREDIBILITY DEMOCRATS YOU KNOW BY PUSHING FOR ALL THESE PROMOTE JUSTICE REFORM BILLS WHERE YOU KNOW IT THESE ARE BILLS AGAIN THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE GOING AFTER. THE ABOVE FOR PRIOR IS LIKE FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FELONY CHILD ABUSE. I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISS COME LONGER W. ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THREE SIX AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE DEBATE AND JUST LET ME PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO MAY NOT BE FULLY AWARE OF THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS WITH THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA WENT ON AN INCARCERATED INCARCERATION BANDS IN THE EIGHTIES AND THE NINETIES AND WE TRULY HAVE YET TO RECOVER. FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY TO TWO THOUSAND BOTH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR'S WIN ON A SPREE OF SENTENCING INFLATION. THAT RESULTED IN A PRISON POPULATION GREATER THAN SENTENCES INSTEAD OF EDUCATION MENTAL ILLNESS JOB TRAINING OR HOUSING. AND AS A RESULT. WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A CIRCUIT OVERLOAD AND SO IN TWENTY ELEVEN. THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT WE WERE INCOMPETENT TO RUN OUR OWN PRISONS AND WERE PUT IN STATE FEDERAL RECEIVERSHIP. IF WE WERE A NATION. ON TO OUR SOUTH OUR INCARCERATION RATES WOULD BE COMPARABLE TO RUSSIA THAT IS TWO TIMES THE RATE IN MEXICO VENEZUELA OR IRAQ AND THREE TIMES THE RATE OF CHINA EGYPT OR CANADA. AND FIVE TIMES THE RATE OF ANY NORTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRY. BUT TALK TO ME. ABOUT OUR RECIDIVISM RATE WE ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST AT OVER 65% NOW I COULD TALK ABOUT THE RACIAL UNDERCURRENT OR OVER CURRENT OF OUR INCARCERATIONS SENTENCE SYSTEM BUT I'M NOT GOING TO INSTEAD I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT MONEY. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT TAX MONEY I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT OUR MONEY. YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY SEE THIS BILL. AS A TAX CUTS NOT FOR THE RICH NOT FOR CERTAIN COMPANIES OR CORPORATIONS BUT FOR EVERYONE. MONEY CONTROLS THIS DEBATE MONEY IN FEAR WHICH I WILL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE LATER SO EVERY TIME EVERY TIME A JUDGE TAX ON A SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS THAT IS BROADER THAT IS EXTRA MONEY EXTRA TIME. FOR THIS SYSTEM. IT'S TAX MONEY THAT COULD BE GOING BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES DOLLARS THAT WE ARE FIGHTING SO DESPERATELY FOR ON THIS FLOOR WE COULD BE SPENDING THAT MONEY FOR BRIDGES FOR HOUSING FOR SCHOOLS FOR ROADS. FOR WILD FIRE MANAGEMENT. TODAY IT COSTS EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO HOUSE AN INMATE IN OVER THREE QUARTERS OF THAT MONEY GOES TO HEALTH CARE AND SECURITY. SINCE TWENTY TEN. THAT COST HAS GONE UP BY 58% BY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THE OPPOSITIONLETTERS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN GETTING SCARING US TO DEATH WHAT THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IS THE MONEY THE MONEY THAT THESE GROUPS DON'T WANT TO LOSE. THAT WE KNOW. BY NOT PASSING THIS BILL GOES BACK INTO A FAILING SYSTEM WITH A HIGH RECIDIVISM RATE OR A LOW RETURN ON INVESTMENT. OF OUR MONEY. CONSTITUENTS YOU'RE SCARED THAT CONSTITUENTS WILL SAY WELL WHY DID YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL WHY DID YOU VOTE YES ON THIS BILL WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM I'M VOTING FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK YOUR TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING INTO A RIGGED SYSTEM NOT DESIGNED TO HELP FOLKS NOT RECIDIVISTS. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU BACK THAT MONEY TO WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS. THAT IS AN ALLOWS ALSO FOR REHABILITATION IN A LOWER RECIDIVISM RATE BECAUSE THIS RIGHT HERE IS NOT WORKING. FIFTEEN YEARS ON A SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT COST. US ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS DON'T YOU THINK THAT MONEY COULD BE SPENT. BETTER. AN SP ONE THREE SIX. I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO CONTRADICT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SET IT KEEPS JUDICIAL DISCRETION. DEFENDERS GO BACK TO PRISON THEREARE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS OTHER SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT FOR YOUR PLEASURE STILL ON THE BOOKS. AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABUSERS CHILD ABUSERS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE LONGER SENTENCES. WHAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT BUT I WILL SAY. IS THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T PUNISH EQUALLY. BECAUSE WE DON'T MONITOR SECONDS MISS COME OVER AND WE DON'T PROSECUTE EQUALLY. AND UNTIL WE FIX THAT. WE NEED TO DO RIGHT. BY REPEALING THE SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT VOTE ON THIS BILL. THEN YOU ARE NOT WORKING TO FIX A SYSTEM THAT IS BROKEN AND THAT IS RATE AND THAT IS COSTING YOU AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS MONEY THAT THEY DESERVE TO SEE SPENT BETTER I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB ONE THREE SIX THANK YOU IS COMMENTED OUT OF MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK MISSION MADAM SPEAKER UP. MEMBERS I THINK I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FOOT TO REALLY CLARIFY WHAT THIS BILL REALLY DOES IN THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE INHERENT IN AND OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS HERE WITH RESPECT TO WHO SAID WHAT AND WHAT DOES IT REALLY DO. THESE ARE THE FAX. THEY ARE THE FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY AND ALICE'S. A BY PEOPLE IN IN POSITIONS TO NOW. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA. IS NO LONGER EITHER A VIOLENT FELONY. OR A SERIOUS FELONY. THE AXE UP AND THIS IS FACTUAL IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT THAT'S FINE AND DANDY. BUT THESE ARE THE FACTS. THE ACTS OF SERIAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM SB ONE THREE SIX. SB ONE THREE SIX WILL MAKE THE CURRENT ONE YOUR SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NON EXISTENT. IT WILL REPEAL ALL ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENTS FOR CONVICTIONS ON MANY CRIMES AGAINST THE FAMILY ESPECIALLY AGAINST WOMEN. MAY GIVE YOU EXAMPLE IF A MAN IS CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HAS PRIOR REPEAT CONVICTIONS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE OR STOCKING SB ONE THREE SIX WOULD TAKE THE DISCRETION AWAY FROM THE JUDGES TO ADD THAT ONE YEAR. ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS. SB ONE THREE SIX WILL PROTECT REPEAT OFFENDERS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHILE PUSHING THE VICTIM ASIDE. MEMBERS THIS BODY IS INCREASINGLY SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT CARES MORE FOR REPEAT CRIMINALS THEN THEY DO FOR REPEAT VICTIM THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE I STRONGLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. ONE A YEAR ENHANCEMENTS JUST DON'T WORK AND WE KNOW THAT BY THE BLOATED CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE ESPECIALLY. IN OUR PRISONS. WHAT YOU'RE HEARING NOW IS WHAT STARTED THIS WHOLE CYCLE A ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENTS MANDATORY MINIMUMS JUST THINK OF FEAR. THIS FEAR. THAT THEY HAVE UP SPEAKING ABOUT ALL THE CRIMES IN CRIMINALS THEY'RE OUT THERE TO SCARE YOU INTO KEEPING MORE A MORE PEOPLE INCARCERATED WHILE NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT. JUDGES DISCRETION THAT THEY CAN LOOK INTO A PERSONS I KNOW THEIR RECORD AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE RELEASED. THE FEAR THAT IF YOU DON'T GIVE DE ACE THE DISCRETION. TO ADMIT TO DO HARSH COURT SENTENCES ON THESE INDIVIDUALS THEN YOU'RE TAKING AWAY. THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO PUNISH PEOPLE TO THE MAX. AND AS WE VOTED ON TODAY WE LEARNED TODAY IF YOU VOTED FOR ONE OF THE BILLS WERE DA'S HAD THE DISCRETION TO TRY TO TAKE AWAY YOUR ABILITY ON THIS FLOOR. TO CHANGE LAW WHICH IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. AND YOU VOTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF LATER ON YOU CHANGE THE RULES THE SOMEONE COULDN'T GIVE AWAY THEIR PLEA BARGAIN. ABILITY THAT THEY WOULD PLEA BARGAINED OR THE RIGHTS OF WEIGHT LATER ON. AND SO FOR ME ONE YEAR IT ENHANCEMENTS WHAT TOOLS TO USE TO KEEP PEOPLE IN JAIL LONGER WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT GETTING RID OF. THE PRIVATE PRISONS WHY ARE WE DOING THAT BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT COST THE COST OF THIS. FEAR BASED SYSTEM IT JUST GOTTEN TOO MUCH. COME ON DJJ THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOUTH. TO REHABILITATE THEM EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. TO KEEP SOMEONE IN JAIL. AND WE STILL ARE INCREASING THE NUMBERS WE'VE INCREASING NUMBERS EVERY YEAR EVERY DECADE SO IT'S NOT WORKING WE GOTTA STOP TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS. WE CANNOT LET FEAR DRIVE US WE CANNOT LET FEAR DRIVERS TO A POINT WHERE WE GO BACK. TO THE OLD TESTAMENT WAY OF AN EYE FOR AN EYE. WE'RE GONNA START CUTTING PEOPLE'S HARMS OFF. WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO SHOW RIGHT NOW WE GOT A SHOW NOT ONLY COMPASSION WE GOT TO START USING OUR HEADS TO DO THIS IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO NOT ONLY DO WE REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PEOPLE THERE INCARCERATED. BUT IF WE DO HAVE TO KEEP SOMEONE INCARCERATED WE HAVE JUDGES. WE HAVE PAROLE BOARDS WE HAVE OTHERS THAT WILL MAKE THAT DECISION TO KEEP THAT PERSON SAFE. LEE IN CAR SURVEYED AND SAFE FROM THE FROM THE RESIDENTS THAT YOU ALL TALK ABOUT YOU WANT TO PROTECT. LET'S WORK TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM SO WORKS FOR EVERYONE. NOT ONLY THE VICTIMS NOT ONLY TO PRIVATE CITIZENS BUT MOST IMPORTANT. WE CHANGE THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT IS FAIR. IS FAIR FOR EVERYONE AND IT WAS JUST STOP THIS INCESSANT NEED. TO SEEK REVENGE ON INDIVIDUALS AND THAT WE START SHOWING LIKE A NEW TESTAMENT WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE CAN CHANGE. PEOPLE CAN GROW AND PEOPLE CAN IMPROVE SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER MISTER GIVE SEND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THIRTY SIX I WANT TO COMMAND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL OF FOUR TO FLOOR JOCKEY FOR SENATOR ARE WIENER AND ALSO WANT TO APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES WHO OF. LOS ANGELES I THINK WELFARE IS CERTAINLY I WAS SPEAKING A LARGE VOICE I'M HAVE SOME NOTES HERE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO USE THESE NOTES BUT THE SIMPLE FACT BECAUSE THIS BILL SPEAKS TO THE HEART AND THE VERY ESSENCE. OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH I REPRESENT SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS AND AGAIN I'M SPEAKING OF THE FOUR POLICE OFFICER THOSE IT DOES WHEN THE EIGHTIES AND EVERYBODY WAS RUSHING TO PUTTING PEOPLE IN IN JAIL INCARCERATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND NOW REPRESENTING OF A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN REACHED OUR SERRATED ARE REPRESENTING THE SIX PORTERS AGAIN IS THAT A CALIFORNIA REALIZING THAT OUT ON THE BLACK BROWN INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE THESE KINDS OF SIT INS ENHANCEMENT. IN ADDITION TO THAT. THIS BILL AGAIN THIS WILL BRING PEOPLE'S ATTENTION SB ONE THIRTY SIX SEEKS TO SAVE MONEY OUR FUTURE COSTS CERTAINLY THE OF. THE DEPARTMENT OF ANSWERED ALREADY ESTIMATED THAT WHAT KIND OF A STATE WE WILL SAVE IF WE CHANGE IN THIS BILL PASSED ON THE FIRST YEAR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE SECOND YEAR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OVER SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SO WE SAVE MONEY. BY ONE PASSING THIS BILL SB ONE THIRTY SAFE AND TAKING DOT TAKING THOSE RESOURCES AND PLACING THEM INTO DIVERSION PROGRAMS PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ENHANCING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO I'M CREATING. OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS GOING TO CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO WE HAVE TO START DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AS MY. COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES ALREADY ARTICULATED A NEW. COLLEAGUES I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE VOTING FOR. UNDER EXISTING LAW IF A PERSON COMMITS A PRIOR FELONY FOR WHICH THEY ARE INCARCERATED. AND THEY SERVICE SENTENCE AND THEN THEY COMMIT ANOTHER FELONY. AND THAT PERSON IS THEN CONVICTED. AND A JUDGE THEN FINDS IN IT THE JUDGE'S SENTENCING DISCRETION THAT IS APPROPRIATE THE JUDGE CAN IMPOSE A ONE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT AND I SHOULD NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT IN MANY CASES THAT LEADS TO ONLY 5280% SERVED WHEN YOU ACCOUNT FOR CREDITS. IF THEY BEHAVE THEMSELVES WHILE INCARCERATED THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THAT ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENT. IT WOULD ELIMINATE THAT JUDICIAL DISCRETION. AND LOOK I SURE CONCERNED ABOUT PRISON OVERCROWDING I GET IT. FOR A LONG TIME WE HAD A LOCK THEM ALL UP APPROACH. THAT LED TO IN JUSTICE IN IT WHAT DO WAY TO CSUS OUR RESOURCES THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT PARTICULARLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WITH DRUG ADDICTION THEY'RE BEING LOCKED UP FOR SENSUALLY HAVING. HEALTH ISSUE AN ADDICTION. BUT WE'RE PAST THAT NOW. THAT IS BEEN SHOWN TO BE UNWORKABLE. AND IT'S ON JUST BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SOME PEOPLE CERTAINLY DESERVE DIVERSION. THEY DESERVE TREATMENT THEY NEED MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THEY DESERVE PROBATION THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE ALSO DANGEROUS. AND THEY DO HORRIBLE THINGS OTHERS. A RATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY POLICY THAT I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS TO SEPARATE OUT. THOSE THAT ARE FUELED. BY DICTION ARE FUELED BY MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND GIVE THEM HELP. FROM THOSE THAT ARE PREDATORY AND DANGEROUS AND THE PREDATORY AND DANGEROUS FOLKS SOMETIMES NEED TO BE LOCKED UP. TO KEEP THE REST OF A SAFE AND TO KEEP THEIR VICTIMS SAFE. THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL TODAY I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR I WORK WITH THEM A LOT ON DIFFERENT PIECES EVEN ON PUBLIC SAFETY LEGISLATION WE JUST DON'T SEE. EYE TO EYE ON THIS ONE. OUR THIS IS ENHANCEMENTS TYPICALLY APPLIED IS BY DEFINITION IT'S APPLIED TO REPEAT OFFENDERS ONLY. IT'S OFTEN APPLIED TO. REPEAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT AS AN EXAMPLE SO WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE VOTING FOR TODAY. I MAY BE REPEAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE. I PUT SOME OF THEM AWAY I'VE DEFENDED SOME OF THEM. IF YOU ARE INCARCERATED FOR FELONY LEVEL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND YOU SERVE TIME AND YOU GET OUT AND COMMIT ANOTHER OFFENSE A FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I BELIEVE THE JUDGE SHOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION TO ENHANCE YOUR SENTENCE BY YEAR WHY. BECAUSE OF YOUR REPEAT VIOLENT AND ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOR THERE IS A BIGGER RISK FOR YOU TO RE OFFEND. THERE IS A BIGGER DANGER TO YOUR VICTIM AND TO OTHERS. THAT. PROTECTS THE PUBLIC AND THAT PROTECTS YOUR VICTIM IF YOU'VE EVER LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THE DVD VICTIM AND SEEN THE TEARS AND SEEN THE FEAR. OKAY AND SEE THAT THE CYCLE OF ABUSE IN ITS TRAGIC HUMAN FORM. IF YOU LOOK IN THEIR EYES THEN YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AND IF YOU HAVEN'T MAYBE YOU DON'T. BUT THAT IS A REAL. SO I ASK YOU PLEASE LEAVE THE DISCRETION WITH THE JUDGE. WE'VE IT'S ON THE BOOKS SO CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO PROTECT PEOPLE BECAUSE FOR THAT VICTIM. THAT YEAR. THAT YEAR IS A YEAR THAT THEY FEEL SAFE AND SECURE AND THEY'RE PROTECTED. PLEASE CONSIDER THAT YOUR VOTE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOVA. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM MISTER COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I DON'T THINK MY COLLEAGUES JUST SPOKE IT'S INTERESTING HAVE YOU SEEN HIM HAVE YOU LOOKED IN THEIR EYES HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO. ALL THE COPPER THIRTY YEARS I WENT TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALLS MY FIRST CALL THE HOSPITAL BIRTH YOU RICK BURGESS THE ROOM A WOMAN HAD BEEN BEAT WITH A PAIR JUMPER CABLES BY HER HUSBAND. I THINK BLACK AND BLUE BEFORE BUT NO YOU CAN BE YELLOW. ON HER ENTIRE BODY FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IS THIS YEAR A LOT ABOUT MONEY AND STUFF BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. TO GO AROUND BEING ON YOUR SPOUSE. WITH TALKING GREAT BODILY INJURY. YOUR BEING YOUR KID. YOU'RE BEING OLD PEOPLE. YOU DON'T GET A PASS ON THAT. THAT'S THE THINK ABOUT WE'VE DONE AB ONE ONLINE PROP YOU HAVE THAT PEOPLE TO DO THINGS THIS WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT DRUG CRIMES ARE SMALL CRIMES IS A VERY SERIOUS CRIMES. UNDER THE CURRENT SYNCING JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION THE DJS MAY REFLECT MAY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AS DO DEFENSE ATTORNEYS BUT ULTIMATELY THE JUDGE DECIDES. WHETHER REASON DOESN'T HAVE TO NOT THE JUDGE HAS A WHOLE FILE THERE KNOWS THE PERSON'S BACKGROUND HISTORY THERE PRIOR CRIMES. OKAY SO DON'T SAY THAT IN HALF FOR YOU FROM LA YOUR OWN DA SAYING THIS IS NOT GOOD. THE FEELING NUMBER THAT YOU'RE DA SAYING THIS.I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MINUTE FOR THE MEMBER THAT'S BRINGS FOR FRANCE F. THIS BILL. BY THE HARDEST WORKING MEMBER IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT REALLY WORKS AS A BILL. ON THIS ONE JUST DOESN'T GET IT. WE GOT TO FIX IT. THINK ABOUT THIS THESE CRIMES ALSO PHONY STALKING A CRIME YOU THE CONNECTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THESE CRIMES INVOLVED TYPICALLY WOMEN CHILDREN. AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ONE CAUCUS IN HERE. THOSE CRIMES AGAINST THEM. IT GOES ON ALL THE TIME. I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE PERSON SAY LAWSPEAKER TALK ABOUT IT BUT VERY FEW. TALK ABOUT VICTIMS. WHAT THE OKAY. IS THAT OKAY TO PUT CAN HOT SCALDING HOT WATER. IT GOES ON EVERY DAY. THINK ABOUT THAT THINK ABOUT TALKING TO A VICTIM AND I'VE DONE THAT HUNDREDS OF TIMES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM. THAT HAD THEIR **** WHIPPED. THAT IS NOT OKAY. SOME FOLKS NOT EVERYONE HAVE A REPEAT HISTORY OF DOING THAT. A PASS DON'T GET A PASS ON THAT DEFENDING. SO WHEN YOU'RE ENHANCEMENT YEAH YOU MAY DO HALF OF THAT THAT'S HOW IT IS. TALK ABOUT MONEY ANYTHING DONE TO A KID I DON'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS YOU DON'T GET A BREAK YOU DON'T GET A PASS WHY DID YOU CAN PASS THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT THAT IS THAT IS INSANE MITCHELL HIT YOUR HEAD AGAINST. THE DAM WALL. IT IS NOT OKAY. WHO IS A STAND UP FOR KIDS. WOMEN AN ELDER WHO ABUSE THOSE PEOPLE. IT'S NOT EASY I WANT TO BE LOCKED UP. BUT FOR CERTAIN CRIMES THERE'S GONNA BE ACCOUNTABILITY AT SOME POINT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S A FREE PASS DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THERE IS THERE ACCOUNTABILITY THE BOTTOM LINE IS MOST FOLKS DON'T DO THESE CRIMES IT NEVER HAPPENS THE MOST FOLKS. BUT PERHAPS A DEAL WITH THE GUILT HELP. FIX RECIDIVISM RATE HELLO RUN THE BUSES IN RATE. IS HIGH WE DON'T WE'RE NOT FIXING THAT ADDRESS THAT. ON BILL HAS NO WHILE WE WITH WHAT THE JUDGES TO HAVE DISCRETION ON BILL BUT ALL THE CABS CHRISTIAN ON THIS WE'RE TALKING TO BOTH SIDES OF OUR MOUTHS. WHICH ONE WE PICK ON. SERIOUSLY GIVE A DOES THIS QUESTION HAS A RIGHT NOW THIS BILL TAKES IT AWAY. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO THESE CRIMES THESE CALLS YOU WANT TO CRY. HE GOES ON EVERY DAY LOOK AT YOUR FILES GONNA CALL SOMETIME GOING AWRY LONG. IF YOU A VICTIM SAY HOW THEY FEEL. SOME WOMAN CRYING SOME KID CRY. IT IS NOT FUN THIS IF YOU HAVE KIDS. THIS ONE THAT YOUR KID WILL BE OKAY. YOU GIVE A PASS. NO SO ARE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS. THANK YOU MISTER COBER DR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I'D TO RISE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR SB ONE THIRTY SIX. DON'T BE DECEIVED SB ONE THIRTY SIX IS A NARROW INCREMENTAL BILL AND IT IS NOT A RADICAL BE BUT AS POINTED OUT BY THE LA TIMES AND OTHER NEWSPAPERS IT IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BILL. YOU KNOW I UP. ONE OF THE TRAGEDIES OF SERVING ON THE ON MANY OF THE COMMITTEES PARTICULAR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE IS IT TO HAVE A TENDENCY YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT WHERE WE- PUT OUR RESOURCES AND OUR TIME AND OUR ENERGY. AND SURELY INCREASING PEOPLE'S TIME IN PRISON HAS COST US I'M A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED TO THAT IF IT ALSO IF IT PROVIDED US WITH SAFETY AND SECURITY. AND IT CREATED A SYSTEM THAT WAS AFFECTED. THAT'S PART NOT A PERSON ON THIS FLOOR WHO BELIEVES OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS AFFECTED. THAT WE ACCOMPLISHING THE GOAL OF RESTORING PEOPLE BACK TO BEING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AND THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO FUNCTION WHEN THEY LEAVE. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS MADE OURSELVES LOOK GOOD BECAUSE WERE HARD ON CRIME. AND HIT THE OTHER FACTS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND SO WHEN YOU SERVE ON A BUDGET COMMITTEE AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN ADDITIONAL BILLION DOLLARS. TO THE PRISON SYSTEM THAT IS INEFFECTIVE. THAT IS REALLY WHERE HOUSING SOULS AND NOT REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE IT IS DIFFICULT. THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW COMPARED TO THE OTHER BILLS WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. WE CAN TALK ABOUT VARIOUS ISSUES AND MOST PEOPLE LIKE TO HARP ON THE ISSUE OF WHAT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND I SEE THE MESSAGE VIOLENCE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WHEN I SERVED ON A COUPLE BOARDS ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CENTER SO I'M NOT A PERSON WHO GIVES A LOT OF SLACK TO THOSE WHO ARE COMMITTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BUT REST ASSURED THAT THE JUDGE STILL MEANS UNDER THE LAW THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO A VARIETY OF SENTENCE THINGS THAT'S THE- THIS HAS NOT CHANGED THEY CAN GIVE TO THREE OR FOUR YEARS SO THEY HAVE A CHOICE OF THE LAW THE MIDDLE AND HIGH. FOR FIRST OFFENDERS BUT SECOND OFFENDERS THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOUR TO FOUR AND FIVE YEARS SO PEOPLE STILL GET GREATER SENTENCING IF THEY OF COMMITTEE SEC DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE SECOND TIME. AND THAT IS NOT TAKEN AWAY IN THIS BILL SO REST ASSURED THAT IS NOT TAKEN WHEN WE HEAR ALL THE HORROR STORIES AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THEY ALSO HAVE IF THEY'RE CONVICTED OF A FELONY ABUSE OF CHILDREN THIS TO ALSO HAS HIGHER SENTENCING DEPENDING UPON WHETHER THE FIRST SECOND CHANCE. AT IS YOUR TANK. THIS BILL. SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT OFTENTIMES IS A PER TWO PEOPLE COMMITTED COMMITTING A FELONY. AND ONE GETS PROBATION AND ANOTHER GET SENTENCE. AND WE KNOW WHAT THE ETHNICITY OF THOSE TWO PEOPLE ARE. MORE THAN LIKELY ONE IS WHITE AND ONE IS BLACK. AND WHEN THEY COME BACK THE SECOND TIME IF THEY COMMIT THIS FELONY OFFENSE NOW THIS PERSON WHO IS INCARCERATED YES ADDITIONAL YEARS WITH THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE SAME OFFENSE AND GOT PROBATION BECAUSE THEY THEY HAD MONEY OR CONNECTIONS THEY'VE BEEN START OFF WITH THE LESSER OFFENSE. WE KNOW THE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT IT WAS DESIGNED TO TRY TO HARNESS ALL THE PROBLEMS WE HAD IN THE WOMAN O OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE HUMAN COST. AND WE STE THIS IS A NARROW BILL MUCH NEARER WITH MANY PEOPLE WHAT WHAT IS IT TO BE AND THERE ARE THAN PRIOR BILLS A DEALS WITH SENSE AND HANSON THIS THE BASICALLY TALKS ABOUT BASICALLY. ONE YEAR IN EXCELLENT. THE CHILD ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE TAKEN OUT AND THEIR HANDLE SEPARATELY IN A DIFFERENT SECTION OF PENAL CODE AND IS NOT AFFECTED BY THIS BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE. THE BUILT ON ENHANCEMENTS BASED ON WHO'S COMMITTED THE CRIME IN AND WHETHER IT'S MORE THAN ONE TIME. I ASK YOU TO SOMETIMES YOU KNOW DO SOME DIFFICULT THINGS. LIKE THINK ABOUT FOLKS RELATED TO YOU WHO MIGHT BE IN THE SAME SITUATION. ONE FAMILIES OF YOUR COULD MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMUNITY. AND THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE SOMETIMES ARE ADDING ON YEARS AND YEARS OF TWO PEOPLE'S LIVES. THAT WHERE THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED THE WORST CRIME IN THE WORLD. BUT WITH BASED ON THIS THERE GIVEN THE ISSUE OF ENHANCEMENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR SYSTEM TREATS PEOPLE OF COLOR DIFFERENTLY AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE MADE UP THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS RECOGNIZED IN THE- IN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY. AND YET THEY HAVE NO ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM. WE GET THE HARDEST IN SAYING IF CHOICE BETWEEN THEM I'M A MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY NORMALLY IT'S A FELONY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. IF THEY HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO THREE AND FIVE YEARS IS NORMALLY FIVE YEARS. WE'VE SEENTHIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND IT IS NOT IN ANY WAY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DESIGNED MAYES LOVER ANY SAFER. SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CAREFULLY THINK ABOUT THIS THIS IS A ONE YEAR AND IT DOES NOT APPLY TO CHILD WHO'S IN IT. THE POP TO THE- VIOLENCE SO ALL THIS DRAMA THAT WE CURRENTLY TO FEAR FOLKS INTO DOING WHAT WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. WE NEED TO THROW THAT OUT AND RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A NARAL SENSIBLE. RECOGNIZED. BY MANY OF YOUR LOCAL NEWSPAPERS AS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BEGIN TO DO. IN ORDER TO MOVE US FORWARD IN THIS STATE SO WE'RE NOT KNOWN AS A PERSON AT THE STATE WITH THE LONGEST. RECORDS OF PEOPLE BEING INCARCERATED. AND YET THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF RECIDIVISM BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN IT DOES NOT WORK. AND AS THEY SAY THE PEOPLE. SAYING PLAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN OBVIOUSLY MUST BE INSANE EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS. THANK YOU DOCTOR ROBERT. MR GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THIRTY SIX TODAY. AND DO SO VERY CAREFULLY AS CO FOUNDER OF THE CENTRAL COUNTY FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER. THAT IS LOCATED IN CONCORD THAT SPECIALIZES AND ASSIST VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I AM VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT VICTIMS. VOICES ARE HEARD THE VICTIMS ARE REPRESENTED. THAT VICTIMS CAN NO WITH THE SURETY AND CERTAINTY. THAT THEY ARE SAFE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND JUST I WENT TO CLARIFY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT. IS PUTTING VIC IS A DETRIMENT ACTUALLY THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE ANNUAL LOOK AT THE LAW AS IT IS WRITTEN. IT APPEARS AS THOUGH AND JUST FOR CLARITY OF SOMEONE COULD IN THEIR SPEECH AFTER ME MAKE SURE OF IT JUST FOR CLARITY IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A THREE YEAR ENHANCEMENT FOR A LE SECOND FELONY OR FOR ANOTHER FELONY BEHIND THE FIRST ONE. AND SO THERE ARE ALREADY STRONGER ENHANCE ITS THAT ARE UNAFFECTED BY BILL WHEN IT COMES TO CHILD ABUSE EXACTLY THE SAME THING THERE ARE RIGHT ALREADY ENHANCEMENTS IN EXISTENCE THAT WHAT IMPACT THESE FELONS OR THE CRIMINALS THAT ARE FAR. MORE SEVERE THAN THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT THAT I BELIEVE UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY IS RARELY USED SO JUST FOR CLARITY I LIKE THAT THAT IN A CLOSING STATEMENT. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON MISSED CONSOLIDATES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO BE HONEST I HAD CONCERNS AS I'VE HEARD MANY. EXPRESSED ON THIS OR- BECAUSE I DO WORRY AND THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE SIR WITH ME LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT I PARTICULARLY WORRY ABOUT. FOLKS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES THAT ARE LIKELY TO RE OFFEND AND THOSE ARE. USUALLY SEX CRIMES SEX CRIMES IN PARTICULAR AGAINST CHILDREN. AND SO DESPITE ENHANCEMENTS IN OTHER PARTS OF LAW I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN APPROPRIATIONS WE ADDED. WE ADDED AMENDMENTS TO EXCLUDE ANY PERSON WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION FOR RAPE AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD SODOMY ORAL COPULATION. CHILD MOLESTATION CONTINUOUS SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD SEXUAL PENETRATION AND ASSAULT AND KIDNAPPING WITH INTENT TO COMMIT A SEX CRIME. THERE ARE SOME CRIMES. THAT PEOPLE COMMIT. THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHY THEY COMMIT AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO REFORM THEM OR TO FIX THEM AND SO WHEN THEY'RE CAUGHT AGAIN WE WANT TO ENSURE. THAT THERE ARE ENHANCEMENTS I THINK AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM CONCORD SAID WE HAVE OTHER PARTS OF THE CODE THAT ALSO DO THAT BUT WE STILL EVEN CALLED OUT EXCEPTIONS ON SEX CRIMES ESPECIALLY SEX CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN. SO WITH THAT I FOUND MYSELF COMFORTABLE ENOUGH. OF COURSE TO ENSURE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN USED IN A PERMIT FOR YOU FASHION. LEE IN A WAY TO ENSURE THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ARE LOCKED UP. THAT I WAS COMFORTABLE WITH DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN WHAT SOME PEOPLE COMMIT THIS CRIME SOMETIMES A NECESSITY VERSUS. AND BEAT YOU KNOW REHABILITATED FROM AND CAN BE. IN ANY AND CAN BE CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY IN THOSE WHICH I FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. YOU MISS GONZALEZ MISTER BONTA. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I DO WANT TO JUST CLARIFY A COUPLE OF ITEMS I AM SPEAKING IN SUPPORT PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I THINK THERE WAS SOME STATEMENTS MADE THROUGHOUT THE TO THAT I AM QUITE A LITTLE CONFUSED HOUSE OF THE HAND HAND SMIT THAT ALREADY EXIST. IN OUR CRIMINAL LAW AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST REGARDLESS OF SB THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX YOU PASS. AND I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY POINT OUT THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST REGARDLESS OF SB ONE THIRTY SIX RELATED TO REPEAT FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND REPEAT. OUR FELONY CHILD ABUSE TODAY A PERSON CONVICTED OF FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION FOR THE SAME CRIME. WITHIN SEVEN YEARS CAN BE GIVEN A LONGER SENTENCE THAN SOMEONE CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND THAT WON'T CHANGE UNDER SB ONE THIRTY SIX THAT A PERSON ALSO CONVICTED OF A FELONY CHILD ABUSE WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION. FOR THE SAME CRIME CAN BE PUNISHED WITH FOUR YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT. ON TOP WITH UNDERLINED SENTENCE. AT THE PRIOR OFFENSE OCCURRED IN TEN YEARS BEFORE THE CURRENT EVENTS AND AGAIN. THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE ADDRESS BE ONE THIRTY SIX SO THERE WERE SOME STATEMENT IT'S WITH THE COP OUT TO MY MIND. IF WE COME OUT TAPIA SOMEONE DESPAIR FIGHT WITH THE EXISTING LAW IS WHAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE. REGARDLESS OF SB THIRTY SIX PASS THERE'S ALSO GONNA GET. BOOKS I CAN CALL. IN HAND FOR REPEAT VIOLENT CRIME OF UP TO THREE YEARS. SO ARE COMING LOTS FULL OF ANY SENSE TO THEM CAN YOU BE THERE FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY INCLUDING DOMESTIC MY- POLLUTING. THE BUTTE. INCLUDE ALL. THE SAME SET OF FACTS. SHE HAD THOSE THAT SPOKE IN SUPPORT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY WHEN OPPOSITION. USES WHAT IS OFTEN TIMES USED. IN IN THESE TYPES OF WITH THESE TYPES OF BILLS IS FEAR. AND I GET THAT BECAUSE USING FEAR. MAKES A LOT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THAT'S pNECESSARY TO CREATE A JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT DOES WORK FOR EVERYONE AND THAT'S FAIR. I'M ASKING ALL YOU COLLEAGUES TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOES NOT THE ANECDOTAL. COMMENTS FROM THOSE IN OPPOSITION. THAT SUGGEST SOMEHOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THINGS. THAT THAT THEY ARE FOUND GUILTY OF WHICH IS SIMPLY. NOT TRUE. WE KNOW. FOR EXAMPLE THAT IN THE- A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES REYES SPECIFIC TO. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE WELL. THERE'S ALREADY. OF THE MECHANISMS. THERE'S ALTERS ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING FOR EXAMPLE. ON THOSE THAT. ARE REPEAT ONLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. PERPETRATORS OF THREE YEAR LONGER THAN A PERSON AT UNDER NOT TO MENTION THAT IS GREAT. THE INJURY. IN ADDITION A FIVE TOP OF THE THANKS. SIMILAR. ENHANCE IS BOTH SING ALONG TO SOLVE AS WELL AS HANDS ON TOP APPLY TO CHECK USE EASY TO SAY WELL WE'RE GETTING RID OF THIS FOR THOSE THAT PERPETRATE CHILD ABUSE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE THAT NATURALLY PULLS OUT ALL OF OUR HEARTSTRINGS WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN WE WANT TO PROTECT THOSE THAT ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND- REMOVING SB ONE THIRTY SIX DOES NOT PREVENT US FROM DOING THAT IN FACT THE EXACT SAME MECHANISM THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO REPEAT OFFENDERS AND THE BIBLE THE CHILD ABUSE AND NUMEROUS. OTHER KINDS OF CON CONTINUE TO BE ON THE BOOKS I CONTINUE TO BE USED TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE. SURE THAT NO ONE. GETS A PASS. AND WE KNOW. WELL AS MEN ABOUT OF OUR COLLEAGUES DO HORRIBLE THINGS AND- GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE. THINGS THEY DO NOW WHAT THIS COMES DOWN TO QUITE SIMPLY AN IBM I APPRECIATE OUR CLICK MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND FOR SPEAKING TO SOME OF THE EXISTING ENHANCEMENTS THAT AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY UP. AND I KNOW THAT. TIMES WHAT'S THAT SAY. WELL ARE WE DOING A LOT ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. ARC CALLED FROM TORRANCE INDICATES THAT HE UNDERSTANDS OUR EFFORTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM HOWEVER. IGNORES THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO PUNISH THOSE THAT PERPETRATE. HEINOUS CRIMES AND VIOLENT CRIMES. OVER DECADES CALIFORNIA BECAME THE INCARCERATION CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE WERE SUDDENLY CREEK COMMITTING MORE CRIMES THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF DECISIONS IN THIS BODY. IT WAS IS THIS BODY THAT CREATED THE INCARCERATION CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. NOW BRICK BY BRICK WE'RE TRYING TO REMOVE. THE FOUNDATIONS OF. MASS INCARCERATION WHILE MAINTAINING THE FOUNDATION OF AN EQUITABLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM YOU CAN DO BOTH WE'VE BEEN MAKING OUR BEST EFFORTS TO DO BOTH AND WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE ENHANCE WAS THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON AGAIN OF THE HUNDRED FIFTY PLUS WE'RE NOT GOING OUT FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY ENHANCEMENTS WE'RE GOING OUT FOR TARGETED. THE ONE YEAR PRISON PRIOR ENHANCEMENT BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BROADLY APPLICABLE ENHANCEMENT. LET'S KEEP ALL THE SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENTS THAT DEAL WITH SPECIFIC CONDUCT SPECIFIC REPEATED CONDUCT THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING A BROUGHT IT HAS BEEN LIKE THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT IS THAT IT GETS BROADLY USE AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THOSE THAT DO HORRIBLE. THINGS WHATEVER THAT MEANS AND FOR OTHER PEOPLE. GET USED ACROSS THE BOARD AGAINST EVERYONE AND IT'S MOSTLY POOR PEOPLE PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE FAR MORE LIKELY THAT I SERVE JAIL. OR PRISON TIME. IF YOU'RE A PERSONAL COLOR IF YOU'RE POOR WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS JUDGES YOU HAVE ALL THE SPECIAL YOU HAVE BIG GIVING YOU A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ENHANCEMENTS NOT ONLY THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN USE THE HIGHER TERM UNDER SENTENCE UNDER SENTENCING GUIDELINES YOU DON'T USE THE LOW AND I HAD A ONE YEAR HAS BEEN USED TO MAKE SURE USE THE HIGHER TRIMTHAT'S A PROVISIONAL PORTS TO THE TALK ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL HISTORY THAT'S WHAT IS PUSH FOR.
