SENATOR MEN. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY FOUR BY SENATOR MEN AND AFTER LEADING TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS SENATOR MAN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB THREE SEVENTY FOUR WHICH EXPANDS PROTECTIONS FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BY INCLUDING REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT. REPRODUCTIVE COERCION CONSISTS OF CONTROL OVER THE REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY OF ANOTHER THROUGH THREAT OF FORCE OR INTIMIDATION THIS CAN INCLUDE DESTROYING CONTRACEPTION WITHHOLDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INFORMATION OR FORCING PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. ALTHOUGH THE TERM REPRODUCTIVE COERCION MAY BE UNFAMILIAR THIS ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR IS UNFORTUNATELY ALL TOO COMMON FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I TWO THOUSAND TEN STUDY FOUND THAT THE PROPER LOOKING AT FIVE FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY 20% OF DV SURVIVORS AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINE SEEKING CARE THERE HAD EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF PREGNANCY COERCION. ANOTHER STUDY OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SEXUALLY ACTIVE HIGH SCHOOL FEMALES FOUND THAT NEARLY ONE IN EIGHT HAD EXPERIENCED REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS AND LASTLY THE NATIONAL HOTLINE AND MYSTIC VIOLENCE HAS FOUND THAT 25% OF WOMEN REPORTED THAT THEIR PARTNER OR EX PARTNER HAD TRIED TO FORCE OR PRESSURE TEM TO BECOME PREGNANT. THIS METHOD OF ABUSE IS FAR TOO COMMON IT IS A KEY PART OF THE EXPERIENCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND YET IT IS STILL ON RECOGNIZED IN OUR LAWS- RECOGNIZING US AS THIS BILL DO DOES WOULD MAKE US THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO DO THAT- AND IT WOULD PROVIDE SURVIVORS WITH THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE FORMS OF RELIEF THEY NEED TO ESCAPE THESE VIOLENT RELATIONSHIPS IDENTIFY THE ABUSE THAT EXPERIENCE TO PROD JUDGES. GIVE THEM THINGS LIKE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS AGAINST THEIR ABUSERS HI THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT NECESSARY CLARITY TO CALIFORNIA'S DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUILDING ON THE WORK OF MY COLLEAGUE- FROM BALDWIN PARK- I THINK FOR JOINING ME AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL AND GOING OUT THERE ON THIS BILL- THIS BILL WILL SAVE LIVES I RESPECTFULLY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM PRESIDENT I'M PRESENTING SP FOUR FOUR SEVEN- WE'VE ALL PLAYED CRITICAL ROLES IN JUST SHAPING STATE POLICY THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA A NATIONAL AND WORLD LEADER. POLICIES RANGE FROM OUR EFFORTS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE TO SUPPORTING WORKERS WITH LIVING WAGES AND WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS AND MUCH MORE. DESPITE OUR STATE'S LEADERSHIP ROLE ON AN ARRAY OF ISSUES THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE ARE BEHIND ON. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY FIVE STATES IN THE ENTIRE NATION THAT REWARDS DEFENDANTS FOR PROLONGING COURT TO SEEK PROCEDURES. LEAVING VICTIMS UNABLE TO OBTAIN JUSTICE S. B. FOUR FOUR SEVEN EXTENDS VICTIMS RIGHTS AND THE RIGHT OF THEIR LOVED ONES TO PURSUE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HUMAN SUFFERING EVEN IF THEY DIE PRIOR TO THE CASE RESOLUTION. ALL TOO OFTEN DEFENDANTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING LAW. PURPOSEFULLY PROLONGING COURT PROCEEDINGS IN HOPES THAT THESE DELAYS WILL OUTLIVE THE VICTIMS OF THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE THAT'S BEEN ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE CURRENT ISSUE WITH COVERED. OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY THE CHAIR OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND I WORK TOGETHER ON THIS POLICY AND AGREED TO INCLUDE A FOUR YEAR SUNSET. TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS TO NARROW THE BILL- THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO BILL NARROWED TO ONLY APPLY TO COVERT NINETEEN CASES BUT THIS ISSUE OF DELAYING COURT HEARINGS EXISTED LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. A CLOSED THE COURTS IN FACT THOSE WHO WERE GRANTED A TRIAL PREFERENCE ARE UNABLE TO GET THEIR CASES HEARD AND RESOLVED AND MAY DIE WITHOUT EVER SEEING JUSTICE THIS ISN'T RIGHT. SB FOUR FOUR SEVEN REFLECTS THE FACT THAT VICTIM SHOULD NOT SUFFER DUE TO DEFENDANTS GAMING THE SYSTEM THE FOR YOUR SUNSET WILL ALLOW AMPLE TIME TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THIS POLICY CHANGE. IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THE INTENDED OUTCOME AN OUTCOME THAT I EXPECT. THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS A BODY TO DEBATE THE MERITS OF THIS POLICY AND IF WE DO NOTHING THE BILL WILL SUNSET.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SEVEN TWENTY ONE BY CENTER HUESO AN ACT RELATING TO CALIFORNIA FARMWORKER DAY. SENATOR HUESO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THE SENATORS I RISE TO PRESENT SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE A BILL THAT WOULD DESIGNATE AUGUST TWENTY SIX AS CALIFORNIA FARMWORKER DAY IN HONOR OF THE CONTRIBUTION FARMWORKERS PROVIDE TO THE STATE. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FARMERS WERE FARMWORKERS BAND- THROUGHOUT THE YEARS MANY M. MANY OF. THOSE LAWS WERE MADE AND THERE BEEN LOTS OF- ACCOLADES GIVEN TO FARMERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION VERY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY MAKE PROVIDING FOOD FOR ALL OF US. AND THE FARMING INDUSTRY IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT WAS UP UNTIL THREE YEARS AGO THAT I WITH THE LATINO CAUCUS. WE CREATED THE FIRST EXHIBIT THE SACK SACRAMENTO EXPERT HONORING FARMWORKERS WAS THE FIRST TIME IT'S EVER BEEN DONE. IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA IN IN ANY OF FAIR. FARMWORKERS NOW OR A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ECONOMY THE UNITED STATES HAS THREE MILLION FARM WORKERS THAT TOIL AND WORK HARD EVERY DAY TO PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLE. DESPITE CONTINUOUSLY SERVING CALIFORNIA THROUGH THEIR LABOR FOR FONG OF FARMWORKERS MANY BENEFITS TO THE STATE. AND THE NATION OFTEN GO UNRECOGNIZED. AS WE CONTINUE TO OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE. THAT THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES ARE REACHING OUR FARM WORKER COMMUNITIES. WE REALLY HAVE TO WORK HARD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SACRIFICES AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY MAKE. TO MAKE CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE MOST PROSPEROUS STATES IN THE NATION. OFTEN WHEN I ASK PEOPLE WHAT IS THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURE IS ONE OF THE TOP INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF THAT RECIPE OF MAKING CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY AND NORMAIS CALIFORNIA PROVIDES UP AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. CALIFORNIA IS A ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE IN AN AGRICULTURE IS ONE OF THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA PROSPERS TO CONTRIBUTE SO GREATLY THORACOTOMY SO TODAY MEMBERS LET'S UNITE. WHEN RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY FARMWORKERS SOMETIMES IN IT ON MY DISTRICT- THEY HAVE A FARM WORKER BREAKFAST EVENT EVERY YEAR AND IT HAPPENS AT TWO AM. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT TIME THESE FAMILIES GET UP TO GO WORK IN THOSE FIELDS IN MANY CASES BECAUSE THERE ARE TEMPERATURES IN MY DISTRICT THAT REACH A HUNDRED DEGREES AT NIGHT TIME. SO EVEN AT TWO AM IN THE MORNING THESE FARMWORKERS ARE WORKING IN 100 DEGREES TEMPERATURE OUT THERE IN THOSE FIELDS. SUCH LET'S RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THEY BRING TO OUR ECONOMY TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND FOR MANY YEARS SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR STATE. FARM WORK HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL TO THE PROSPERITY OF OUR STATE AND FOR THOSE. INDIVIDUALS THOSE MEN AND WOMEN AND OFTEN CHILDREN OF SUPPORT THEIR PARENTS WORK. WE NEED TO SET SOME TIME TO RECOGNIZE. THE CONTRIBUTION THEY MAKE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WOULD ESTABLISH AUGUST TWENTY SIX IS CALIFORNIA WORKING FARM WORKER DAY. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ENDING IN AN EQUITIES IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WE ALL KNOW THAT FARMERS ARE AMONG THE POOREST OF OUR WORKERS IN OUR STATE OFTEN SUFFERING. POOR WORKING CONDITIONS OF A LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING- SOMETIMES A LIVING COMMUNITY SAID DOES NOT HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR THE BEST SCHOOLS OR ACCESS TO INTERNET AND WE CAN COME UP WITH A LONG LIST. OF INEQUITIES THAT THESE OUR COMMUNITY SUFFER. AND WE ALL THE WHILE WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THEY MAKE TO OUR STATE THANK THEM. AND PLEDGED TO WORK. HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY OUR FARMWORKERS ARE PROVIDED WITH EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE SO THEY CAN RAISE OUR FAMILIES AND ALLOW THE KIDS TO GET. I EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION AND MONDAY- WE CAN CELEBRATE FARMWORKERS AS PLACE WHERE PEOPLE DO WE WANT TO MAKE A CAREER I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO WORK IN FIELDS MYSELF AND IT'S VERY HARD WORK AND I'VE WORKED A LONG FARMWORKERS WHO ARE CONSIDERED BY OUR FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AS UNSKILLED LABOR I CHALLENGE ANYONE TO TRY TO KEEP UP. WITH WITH A CAREER FARMWORKERS THESE THE THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST AMAZING. AMAZINGLY SKILLED LABORS AT TWO I JUST AMAZING WORK AND NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE THESE COMMENTS AND MOVE FORWARD THIS BILL. FOR THAT WILL RECOGNIZE OUR FARM WORKING COMMUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER HUESO WILL MOVE TO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE STARTING WITH SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. BRINGING A BILL FOR IT I WANTED TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT. OF MY EXPERIENCE AS A FARMER. BUT BEFORE I ACTUALLY. OWNED A FARM I WAS A FARM WORKER FOR MY FAMILY FARM. AND WORKED ALONGSIDE- AS AS A GREAT SENATOR MANCHIN PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SKILLED AND VERY AMAZING ARE YOU YOU YOU CAN NOT KEEP UP WITH THEM THEY ARE AMAZING. INDIVIDUALS AND I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT WE HIGHLIGHT WHAT THEY DO WHEN WE GO EVERY DAY TO WEEK THREE TIMES A DAY MOST PEOPLE EAT- AND SOME OF US MORE TIMES A DAY OBVIOUSLY- BUT THOSE THERE'S A SUPPLY CHAIN BEHIND THAT AND IT'S- HUMAN BEINGS. IT'S HUMAN BEINGS THAT DO THESE VERY. DIFFICULT JOBS HARVESTING PLANTING WORK IN THE SOILS AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY I THINK IT'S A THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE CALIFORNIA. IS A LEADER IN THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO AGRICULTURE AND ALSO THE ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE HERE IS AMAZING NO WHERE IN THE WORLD THAT WE HAVE. THIS YEAR IS AND THE DELTA THE DESERT'S PLACES WE CAN PRODUCE THE COAST WE CAN PRODUCED. ALL KINDS OF FOOD THAT DOESN'T GET PRODUCED. ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD LIKE IT DOESN'T CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE. MILLIONS OF FARM WORKERS OUT THERE THAT ARE EVERY DAY AS A SENATOR SAID GETTING UP EARLY MORNING THIS MORNING. ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES CALLED ME AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHO'D ALREADY BEEN AT WORK. FOR A COUPLE HOURS. BECAUSE IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR WHERE WE'RE PLANTING. AND WE'RE GETTING READY TO GET ACROSS AND- TONIGHT I WILL BE ON A TRACTOR. IN A FIELD PREPARING THE LAND SO WE CAN PLAN. SO EVERY TIME THAT YOU TAKE A BITE OF FOOD THINK ABOUT WHERE IT CAME FROM BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEBODY. THAT IS WORKING HARD TO PROVIDE THAT AND IT'S THE LABORS AND THE PEOPLE WHO OPERATE THESE PIECES EQUIPMENT. AND IT'S AMAZING TO SEE WHAT WE'VE REALLY DONE IN AGRICULTURE AND CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE WAY AND I THINK WE SHOULD LEAD. BY RECOGNIZING THE PEOPLE WHO DO IT THE HARD WORKING PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE FARMWORKERS SO I SUSTAINED IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY CENTER TORONTO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR SB SEVEN TWO ONE I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO SHOW THEIR RESPECT AND APPRECIATION FOR THE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FARMWORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. FARMWORKERS AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS CONTINUE TO PERFORM DURING THE PANDEMIC HARD LABOR AND WITHOUT IT WE WOULD NOT HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE AND BECAUSE OF THEM WE NEVER HAD A FOOD SHORTAGEIN THE CITIES IN THE STORES IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE LIVE. TO THIS DAY. WELL SOME FARMWORKERS DO WELL AND ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES IN A GOOD WAY. THE MAJORITY OF THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT PERFORM AGRICULTURAL LABOR IN THE STATE. BASED POVERTY PAY EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS AND WEAK PROTECTIONS FROM THE HEALTH RISKS THAT THEY FACE EVERY DAY. THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME. I WORKED IN THE FIELD UNTIL I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL ALONGSIDE ALL MY SISTERS AND BROTHERS AND MY PARENTS. MY FATHER WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS WORK VERY ROUD AND HE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUS. AND EITHER LET US TAKE ANY SHORT CUTS HE MADE SURE WE DID OUR WORK RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT WE GOT PAID OR DIDN'T GET PAID FOR. THE EXPECTED ME TO WORK HARD. AND I'M PROUD AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR INSTILLING THAT A HARD WORK ETHIC IN ME. THEY PERFORM BACK BREAKING LABOR WITH THE HOPE THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE ABLE TO CLIMB THE LADDER OF OPPORTUNITY JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER AMERICAN. BUT IN ORDER FOR THEIR DREAMS TO COME TRUE WE MUST SUPPORT THEM BEYOND WORDS WHEN THEY CALL ON US WE MUST SUPPORT THEM NO ONE WHO WORKS A FULL TIME JOB IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE TO FACE POVERTY. THE FIGHT FOR HIGHER WAGES HEALTH CARE THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN FOR ALL WORKERS GOES ON. AND IT'S UP TO THIS BODY TO PROTECT AND UPHOLD THOSE RIGHTS. EVERY JOB HAS DIGNITY AND EVERY WORKER HAS VALUE I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD- AN ASSET YOU SUPPORTED TODAY- I WANT A SECOND OKAY A NUMBER OF COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION THAT THIS PAST YEAR- WITH THE PANDEMIC RAGING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE WE'VE SEEN THE- IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE PHARMACOLOGY DESPITE THE FACT. THAT FARMWORKERS WERE- IT THIS DISEASE- A REALLY TOOK HOLD IN THE FARMWORKERS COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE WORKING CONDITIONS SOME OF THE LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE TRAVELING CONDITIONS HE DIDN'T SEE COURAGE'S OF FOOD YOU SUCH SHORTAGES OF PAPER IN ALL PAPER PRODUCTS YOU WENT TO THE STORE AND THEY WERE SHELLS THAT WERE EMPTY WHEN IT CAME TO HAND SANITIZER AND- OTHER PROTECTED PROTECTED PROTECTED DEVICES BUT IT'S BUT FARMWORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS DESPITE THE FACT. THAT THEY WERE TERRIFIED OF CONTINUING TO WORK THEY DID AND THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON IT ON THE TABLE AND WE DID NOT SEE THE SHORTAGES AND LINES OF PEOPLE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE FOOD DURING A PANDEMIC AND I WANT TO SALUTE THEM FOR THAT BECAUSE THEY TOOK CARE THIS COUNTRY DESPITE THE FACT THAT IN MANY WAYS WE HAVE NOT TAKEN CARE OF THEM SO I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ALSO GET UP AND SAY THAT IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE ENACT IMMIGRATION REFORM TO ALLOW THEM TO EARN A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. SO THAT THEY CAN FEEL SO THEY CAN COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND FEEL LIKE THEY'RE APPRECIATED AND THAT THEIR SERVICES IS- IS RECOGNIZED IN IN THE UNITED STATES AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND- SENATORS SAID TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE. I'M ALSO PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE. AND I WANT TO VALIDATE ALL THE COMMENTS ALREADY EXPRESSED HERE ON THIS FLOOR. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT FARMWORKERS ARE THE LIFELINE TO. TO ALL OF US AS ALREADY STATED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. WE SAW HOW THEY CONSISTENTLY WORKED HARD. TO THEM IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE WEATHER LOOKS LIKE SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO WORK IN EXTREME HEAT. SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING ON. THEY'RE ALWAYS WORKING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FOOD ON OUR TABLE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE ALL THE FARMWORKERS WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. THROUGH THE BEST FEDERAL PROGRAM. BECAUSE WHEN THIS COUNTRY NEEDED THEM. WHEN THIS COUNTRY CALLS FOR HELP. THEY WERE MORE THAN WILLING TO COME STEP UP AND DO THE WORK THAT OTHERS WOULD NOT DO. I KNOW MY FATHER ALONG WITH SO MANY OTHERS WHO CAME AS TEENAGERS MY FATHER SPEAKS OF BLISTERS ON HIS HANDS THE LONG HOURS OF WORK SLEEP. HUNGRY BUT EVEN WITH ALL OF THAT. HE CONTINUED TO WORK AND SO I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO FROM BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE IT IS TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF FARMWORKERS I WILL ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES. THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE DECENT WAGES HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW THEY WERE THE MOST IMPACTED DURING THIS PANDEMIC AS IT PERTAINS TO BEING OUT THERE WITHOUT PROTECTION SO I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO START THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE MEANS TO US IN THIS COUNTRY. GIVING THEM A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP BECAUSE WE SAID WE NEED- BUT YET WE'RE NOT WILLING TO STEP UP AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THEM HERE SO THEY CAN LIVE WITH DIGNITY. SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I TO WANT TO- FIRST OFF THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRING FORWARD SB SEVEN TWENTY ONE AND URGE- STRONG VOTE IN SUPPORT. AS CHAIR OF THEAPI LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- MANY API- IMMIGRANTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND TO THE STATE ACTUALLY TO WORK ON FARMS AND THREE FARMWORKERS. AND FACT- NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE FILIPINO FARMWORKERS- AND LARRY AT LEON- WORKED CLOSELY- PARTNERED WITH- CESAR CHAVEZ TO. FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS FOR FARMWORKERS AS WELL- MANY API CONTINUE TO WORK AS FARMWORKERS- HERE IN THE STATE AND- IT'S CERTAINLY IN A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE API COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- THIS RESOLUTION- THAT ALLING FOR RECOGNITION OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FARMWORKERS TO OUR STATE INTO OUR COUNTRY AND I THINK IT'S VERY NOTED BY ME I COLLEAGUES HERE- L. WHEN WE GO TO THE GROCERY STORE OR RESTAURANT. AND FOOD IS THERE AND- WE SHOULD TAKE THAT FOR GRANTED SOMEONE WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET IT THERE. AND TO THOSE OF THE FARMWORKERS THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AYE ARJUN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. CENTER HER TADO. THANK YOU MADAM. I RISE AND SUPPORT OF S. B. TWO ONE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I REPRESENT- THE REGION- WITH MANY MANY FARMWORKERS THAT ARE PROVIDING FOOD FOR US. ON A DAILY AND- WE NEED TO HONOR THEIR WORK AND THEIR SACRIFICE AND THE AND THE WORKERS THEMSELVES- THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE EVERY DAY OUR. UNBELIEVABLE AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE MINUTE AND EVERY WAY POSSIBLE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO SAID ARE WE HAVE FARMWORKERS SAID THAT ARE. NOT JUST LATINO WE HAVE FILIPINO FARMWORKERS WE HAVE LONG FROM FARMWORKERS WE HAVE INDIAN FARMWORKERS. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FARMWORKERS WE THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THEM- S.

LET'S GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HER TADO CENTER CALM WATER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN TWO ONE AND WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. YOU KNOW I'M STANDING TO ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE. THE SMALL. FARMS AND THE MANY FARMERS THAT ARE SCATTERED ACROSS. OUR URBAN AREAS WHO ARE ALSO DOING THEIR PART. TO COMBAT FOOD INSECURITY. AND WHEN THEY'RE FARMING ON LAND CAN WE HAVE A HUNDREDS OF SMALL FARMS ACROSS LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND MANY IN MY DISTRICT. THE ISSUES. THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ON THE FLOOR ALSO RESONATE WITH FOLKS IN OUR URBAN AREAS ISSUES AROUND WATER AND WATER RIGHTS LAND STATUS AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF THESE SMALL FARMS. ARE RUN AND MANAGED BY FARMERS WHO ARE BLACK WHO ARE BROWN WHO ARE ASIAN WHO ARE DOING THIS WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO CONNECT TO THE LAND KNOWING THAT THEY LIVE IN AN URBAN AREA. THEY ARE DOING THIS WORK. TO PRESERVE THE PROFESSION. EVEN AMONGST THE HIGHRISES. THEY'RE DOING THIS WORK TO CELEBRATE THEIR OWN CULTURAL LEGACY AND TO SHARE IT WITH OTHERS. AND BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO FEEDING THEIR FAMILIES FROM BACKYARD PLOTS ALL THE WAY UP TO FULL TIME OPERATIONS THAT SUPPLY STORES AND RESTAURANTS ACROSS THE COUNTY. URBAN FARMING SERVES A VITAL ROLE. IN FOOD SECURITY AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND SO I JUST WANT MY COLLEAGUES KNOW FROM SANFORD FROM SAN DIEGO THAT YOUR COLLEAGUES IN YOUR URBAN AREAS AND IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY STAND WITH YOU. AND I SUPPORT SB. SEVEN TWO ONE. THANK YOU CENTER CALM WATER SINGLE FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATE HUESO YOU MAY CLOSE.

BY A PROFESSOR NAMED TIM HERNANDEZ THAT WROTE A BOOK CALLED ALL THEY WILL KILL CALL YOU. THE DETAILED AN INCIDENT IN COALINGA CALIFORNIA MANY YEARS AGO THAT INVOLVED A BUT I SAID WAS THAT WERE BEING TRANSPORTED ON AIRPLANE THAT AIRPLANE CRASHED. AND ABOUT SIXTEEN OF US ADULTS WERE KILLED IN THAT CRASH. AND WHEN THEY WERE BURIED THEY DIDN'T EVEN PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE TOMBSTONE THEY JUST PUT A NUMBER. AND PEOPLE FELT THAT THAT WAS. REALLY A RESULT OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE FARMWORKERS AND- AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN SEEM TO DESERVE. A GETTING THEIR NAMES ON THE VERY TOP WHERE THEY WERE BURIED AND- THANKS TO HIS WORK AND- YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY THEY WERE GIVEN. A PROPER BURIAL WITH WITH- A DEMARCATION THAT WAS FITTING TO THEM AS HUMAN BEINGS. ALSO IN MY DISTRICT I REMEMBER. YOU KNOW GOING NOT ONLY MY DISTRICT BUT I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE TO VISIT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND- SENATORS WERE WE WERE WE- ALL EVERY PART OF THE STATE IS BEAUTIFUL AND ALL OF US REPRESENT A LITTLE PIECE OF IT AND- EVERY SINGLE CORNER OF CALIFORNIA'S GOD'S COUNTRY. AND I HAVE COME INTO CONTACT WITH SO MANY FARMWORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND A NEW WELL IN ONE OF MY TRAVELS I REMEMBER SEEING A LARGE GROUP OF FARMWORKERS IN LINE TO GET FOOD FROM CATHOLIC CHARITIES AND IT'S A REQUIREMENT. THAT THE VERY PEOPLE THAT PICK ARE FOODS THAT PREPARE FOODS GROW OUR FOODS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HEALTHY FOODS ARE ALWAYS LAST IN LINE. TO RECEIVE. SOMETIMES THE MOST BASIC BASIC SUSTENANCE. IT'S VERY SAD THAT THEY'RE LAST IN LINE TO RECEIVE FOOD. AND THEY HAVE TO WAIT IN THE HEAT IN THE SUN AND BANK THANKS TO THE CATHOLIC CHARITIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE. FOOD FOR FARMWORKERS THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT AND THAT THAT REALLY IS A SHAME THAT THEY CAN NOT. A HAVE. THEY DESERVE THE FOOD IN OUR STATE AND WHATEVER PICK THEY DESERVE TO PICK BEST A FIRST ENOUGH UP UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T. HAPPEN THAT WAY. SO THANK YOU.

COLLEAGUES I RISE TO A JURY MEMORY OF ONE OF SAN DIEGO'S MOST HONORABLE GENTLEMAN NAVY VETERAN CLAYTON SHINGLE BURKE WHO PASSED AWAY ON APRIL FOURTEENTH AT THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND THREE. BORN IN CARROLL IOWA CLAYTON LED A LONG REMARKABLE LIFE THAT TOOK HIM FROM THE MIDWEST TO HONOLULU TO THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT IN SAN DIEGO. HE LIVED THROUGH THE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN SPANISH FLU EPIDEMIC AND THE COBIT PANDEMIC THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND TWO WORLD WARS. ONE OF THE MOST DEFINING MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE OCCURRED ON DECEMBER SEVENTH NINETEEN FORTY ONE. WHEN ENEMY PLANES BOMBED PEARL HARBOR. CLAYTON BRAVELY DROVE A TRAIN LOADED WITH MISSILES OUT OF THE LINE OF FIRE PREVENTING AN EXPLOSION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE AN ALREADY DEVASTATING SITUATION EVEN MORE CATASTROPHIC. HE THEN RETURNED TO THE BASE TO HELP HIS FELLOW SERVICE MEMBERS. A MEMBER OF THE GREATEST GENERATION AND BELIEVED TO BE THE OLDEST PEARL HARBOR SURVIVOR CLAYTON PROUDLY SERVED IN THE NAVY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. AFTER RETIRING HIS UNIFORM CLAYTON SERVE SAN DIEGO AS A CUSTODIAN AT PATRICK HENRY HIGH SCHOOL AND OTHER LOCAL SCHOOLS IN HIS FREE TIME HE KEPT SCORE FOR THE LOCAL FOOTBALL GAMES AND VOLUNTEERED AT OUR LADY OF GRACE PARISH FOOD PANTRY. IN ADDITION TO HIS LIFE OF SERVICE CLAYTON'S LEGACY INCLUDES BUILDING A FAMILY WITH HIS WIFE OF SEVENTY FOUR YEARS A LISA. TOGETHER THEY HAD SEVEN CHILDREN MORE THAN FORTY GRAND CHILDREN AND GREAT GRAND CHILDREN AND GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. PROPELLED BY HIS PERSONAL MOTTO ONE DAY AT A TIME. CLAYTON WAS A HUMBLE MAN WHO REDITED HIS COURAGEOUS NAVAL CAREER AND COMMUNITY SERVICE TO SIMPLY DOING THE JOB HE HAD TO DO. I WAS SO PROUD TO PRESENT THIS MODEST MAN WITH THE RESOLUTION ON HIS HUNDRED AND THIRD BIRTHDAY IN OCTOBER.
