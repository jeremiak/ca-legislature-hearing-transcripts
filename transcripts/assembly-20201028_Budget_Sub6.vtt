01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:14.764
OUT AND I HEARD EXACT PERFECT

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:15.932
EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAS BEEN

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:17.100
GOING ON IN SKILLED NURSING

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:19.268
FACILITIES SINCE OMBUDSMAN HAVE

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:20.670
NOT BEEN PART OF THE DAY TO DAY

01:02:20.736 --> 01:02:23.106
OPERATIONS WE HAD A RESIDENT

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.040
WHO'D BEEN SKILLED NURSING

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.075
FACILITY FOR MANY YEARS WHO

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:27.577
THE GREAT FAMILY THEY HAD A

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:29.345
CARE GIVER THAT HELP TO PROVIDE

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.380
CARE TWENTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.282
BUT DURING COLLEGE SHE'D LOST

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.284
NEARLY TWENTY POUNDS SHE BEGAN

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.220
TO DEVELOP PRESSURE SORES SO

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.988
THE FAMILY IN GOOD FAITH GOT

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:41.124
MEDICARE HOSPICE INVOLVED THAT

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.259
IS PAID FOR BY MEDICARE SHE

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.927
WAS ARTIFICIALLY RT BEING PAID

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:47.096
BE A MEDIC CAL THE CARE GIVER

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.664
THAT WAS COMING IN THE FACILITY

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:50.533
WAS OUT FEEDING HER SOME OF HER

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.468
MEALS EACH DAY AND WAS TAKING

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:53.503
THE TIME THAT SHE I NEEDED

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:54.303
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT HER

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.339
SHE RETAIN WEIGHT I WE TALKED

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:57.473
WITH THE SILLY BAD ENSURING

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.675
THAT SHE HAD ADEQUATE -- WOUND

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:01.377
CARE AS WELL AS SOMEONE TO

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.146
SIT WITH HER JUST TWICE A DAY

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:04.480
AND SPEND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.382
BEATING HER THE RESPONSE WAS

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.251
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT AND

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:09.585
I THINK THAT IS THE TRUE STORY

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:10.920
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WHICH IS

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.655
FACILITIES MAY BE WELL MEANING

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.557
WHO ARE VERY BUSY WITHOUT

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.058
PROPER OVERSIGHT WE'RE SEEING

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.194
A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CARE

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:19.228
AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.164
RESIDENTS AND I THINK THIS IS

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.798
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUES

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.200
THE COPA NINETY SIX WEIGHTED

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.501
THEY'RE NOT HIGHLY TECHNICAL OR

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.803
COMPLEX THEIR BASIC ISSUES OF

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:30.339
STAFFING MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.375
AND INFECTION CONTROL NOW IN

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:35.077
CALIFORNIA FACILITIES -- THIS

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.712
SUMMER WHEN THEY WERE PATIENTS

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.781
WITH ONE COPA NINETEEN FACTION

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:40.383
AT THOSE FACILITIES HAD ON

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:41.951
AVERAGE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.452
FEWER REGISTERED NURSES IN

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:44.921
THE BUILDING AT THE END OF TWO

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.656
THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT SHOULD

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:47.790
TELL YOU A LOT OF THINGS BUT

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.358
ONE OF THOSE THAT ARE AND TAKE

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:50.493
NO GUFF AND IF THEY ARE IN

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.295
BUILDINGS AND PRESENT BUILDINGS

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:54.363
THEY DRASTICALLY IMPROVE CARE

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:56.098
THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT AS

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.100
OF THIS SUMMER ABOUT NINETY ONE

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.302
PERCENT OF THE FACILITIES THAT

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.003
HAD ACTED COLLUDED NINETEEN

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:02.738
OUTBREAKS NINETY ONE PERCENT

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.574
OF THOSE HAD A PRIOR VIOLATION

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.375
RELATED TO INFECTION CONTROL

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.910
THAT MEANS THEY WERE CITED

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.545
FOR ISSUE WHEN THEY KNEW THAT

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:10.813
THE LICENSING ENTITY WAS THE

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.582
BUILDING AND I DON'T THINK THIS

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:13.916
TO INDICT THE FACILITIES BUT I

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.251
DO THIS TO SAY THAT WE'VE HAD A

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:17.320
DEMONSTRATED HISTORY OF A LACK

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:19.121
OF ENFORCEMENT IN FACILITIES

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.423
AND WE COULD IDENTIFY WHERE

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:21.591
THE PROBLEM ISSUES WERE GOING

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:24.360
TO HAPPEN NOW POOR STAFFING

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:25.661
IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.930
WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:29.131
THE GASOLINE TO COPE WITH

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.167
NINETEENTH MATCH WITHIN THE

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:32.969
LONG TERM CARE INDUSTRY DIRECT

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:35.037
CARE WORKERS ON AVERAGE EARN

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.572
ONLY ONE TO TWO DOLLARS MORE

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:38.074
PER HOUR THAN MINIMUM WAGE TO

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.142
DO THE MOST CRITICAL WORK THAT

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.577
WE HAVE TO CARE FOR OLDER AND

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.879
DISABLED ADULTS THESE DEDICATED

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.414
PEOPLE WORK SIXTY TO EIGHTY

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:47.183
HOURS PER WEEK OUT OFTEN AT

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.651
MULTIPLE LOCATIONS TO PAY THE

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.653
MOST MODICUM OF AND MODEST OF

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.623
RENT AND EXPENSES MEANWHILE YOU

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:54.957
MAY HAVE A CARE GIVER BECAUSE

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:56.425
OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS WORKING

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:57.793
AT MULTIPLE LONG TERM CARE

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.795
FACILITIES MEANING THEY COULD

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:00.796
BE WORKING AT THE FACILITY

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:02.098
EIGHT WHERE THERE IS A CURRENT

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.799
ACTIVE OUTBREAK AND THEY COULD

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:04.834
THEN BE GOING TO CARE FOR A

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.335
FEE AT FACILITY B.

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:07.770
AND THIS PRACTICE IS NOT

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.038
EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED BY OUR

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:11.674
LICENSING BODIES NO IN ORDER

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:12.675
TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:13.943
ISSUES I'VE RAISED YOUR DEBT

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.177
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:17.346
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE FIRST

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:18.681
AND I THINK THIS ECHOES DR

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.683
WATERMAN SENTIMENTS IS WE

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.285
NEED TO REQUIRE LONG TERM

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.353
CARE FACILITIES TO IMMEDIATELY

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.855
RAISE COMPENSATION FOR

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:27.290
CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.392
AND CAREGIVERS THIRTY PERCENT

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:30.993
AND I KNOW THAT'S MIGHT SEEM

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.128
LIKE A LOT TO YOU BUT I WANT

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:33.029
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.597
THAT REALLY IS TALKING ABOUT

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.632
THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR THESE

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.000
PEOPLE ARE DOING CRITICAL WORK

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:39.635
AND WE NEED TO HELP MAINTAIN

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:42.204
AND RETAIN THE INDUSTRY AND

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:43.439
AGAIN YOUR PUBLIC BUT NICOLE

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:44.740
WE ALREADY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:46.142
CARE GIVERS AND THAT'S WHAT

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.343
I'M GONNA TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.711
A LITTLE WORN WHICH IS THAT I

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.546
HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT IN CONTRA

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:51.814
COSTA COUNTY WE'VE CREATED

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:53.449
TO HEALTH CARE CAREER PATHWAY

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:54.617
WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.052
TRAINING PROGRAM FOR CERTIFIED

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.953
NURSING ASSISTANTS THAT IS BOTH

01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.889
PERSON CENTERED IS BASED IN

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.657
REALITY AND HAS COMPREHENSIVE

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:02.825
SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS AND WE

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:03.926
HAVE NEARLY A HUNDRED PERCENT

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:05.761
GRADUATION RATE AND WE HEAR

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:07.063
FROM THE FACILITIES THAT THE C.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:07.730
N.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:08.964
A.'S THAT COMPLETE THAT PROGRAM

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.366
OR MORE AKIN TO PEOPLE WHO'VE

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:11.534
BEEN WORKING FOR A YEAR IN THE

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.736
INDUSTRY AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.538
ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT'S VERY

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:16.906
CHALLENGING TO CREATE CERTIFIED

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:18.307
NURSING ASSISTANT PROGRAMS

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:20.509
THE REQUIRED -- THE CURRICULUM

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.178
BY CDPH IS PARTICULARLY

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:24.246
PRESCRIPTIVE AND RESTRICTIVE

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.482
AND ALLOWS VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.084
FRANKLY NONE FOR WHAT THE

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.786
REALITIES OF CARE GIVING OUR SO

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.655
I ASK YOU TODAY TO DEDICATE A

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:34.557
STATEWIDE TASK FORCE TO REVIEW

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:35.891
THE CURRENT TRAINING PROTOCOLS

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.626
FOR CNA'S AND ALLOW THIS

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.395
TASK FOR TO BE BOLD AND TO BE

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:41.364
INNOVATIVE AND PROPOSED UPDATES

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:43.299
THE TRAINING CURRICULUM AND

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.000
THE TESTING PROCESS THERE ARE

01:06:45.067 --> 01:06:46.802
CURRENTLY CNA'S WHO COMPLETED

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.404
TRAINING DURING QUARANTINE

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:49.739
DURING KOBE THEY COMPLETED

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:51.073
THEIR TRAINING BUT THEY'VE BEEN

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.508
UNABLE TO TEST BECAUSE THERE

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:53.976
IS SUCH A BACKLOG AT TESTING

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.711
CENTERS MEANWHILE WE HAVE

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:57.279
ISSUE STOPPING WAIVERS TO ALLOW

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.848
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:00.149
OPERATE AT LESS THAN OPTIMUM

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:02.952
STAFFING NEXT I LIKE THIS

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:04.019
TO TALK ABOUT THE CREATE

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:05.588
COMPREHENSIVE STRAIGHT TEAM

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:07.356
I HAVE SEEN WHEN THERE IS AN

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.958
OUTBREAK THERE IS STILL A GAP

01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:10.726
BETWEEN THE LICENSING ENTITY BE

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.528
THAT CDSS WERE C.

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:14.930
PH AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:16.699
THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THOSE

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:17.900
ENTITIES ARE NOT NORMALLY IN

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:19.435
FACILITIES EVERY DAY THERE

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:20.803
IS A LACK OF DISCERNMENT FOR

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.271
THOSE BAD ACTORS WHO WOULD

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:23.606
CHOOSE TO USE THIS SITUATION

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.941
TO NOT BE ENTIRELY TRANSPARENT

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:27.343
ADDITIONALLY WHEN THERE IS A

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:28.878
PROBLEM WITH STAFFING ALL TOO

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.079
OFTEN FACILITIES ARE GIVEN A

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:31.680
LIST AND TOLD TO CALL STAFFING

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:33.482
AGENCIES WHEN WHAT WE NEED

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.384
TO AS ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:36.919
WE NEED TO CALM WITH TRAINS

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.687
YOU NAY TO HER TO WORK ON THE

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:40.489
GROUND IMMEDIATELY WE CANNOT

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.724
SIMPLY SEND IN WELL MEANING

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.193
AND WELL TRAINED EMTS WHO

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.327
ARE NOT ABLE TO ACTUALLY DO

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:46.729
THE WORK AND THIS ACTUALLY

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.164
PROLONGS THE OUTBREAK AND I

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.466
BELIEVE DIMINISHES CARE WE

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:52.234
NEED TO DIRECT CITY PH ANSI

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:54.303
PSS TO ADOPT A MORE PROACTIVE

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.371
APPROACH AS IT RELATES TO

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:57.239
EMERGENCY PLANNING WE CAN NO

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:58.974
LONGER SIMPLY SAY TO REVIEW AN

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.743
EMERGENCY PLAN A FACILITY THERE

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.144
NEEDS TO BE AN APPROVAL AND

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.546
A CLEAR DISTINCTION TO ENSURE

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:05.581
THAT THEIR PLANS ARE ARE READY

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:06.982
FOR EXAMPLE IN CINEMA COUNTY

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:08.451
THERE WAS EVACUATIONS AND

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:10.119
FACILITIES EVACUATED TO A LOCAL

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:12.388

CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES HAVE

FACED A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.777

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.547
HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF THE

NEWS IS THAT LEGISLATIVE

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:57.226
CHANGES CAN BE ADOPTED THAT

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.995
WILL SAVE LIVES BY ADDRESSING

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:03.666
THREE AREAS ONE IMPROVEMENTS

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:06.702
IN STAFFING AND WAGES TO

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:09.371
INCREASE FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:12.141
AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THREE

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:14.109
INCREASED OVERSIGHT AND

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:17.379
ENFORCEMENT FIRST MY COLLEAGUES

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.081
AND I HAVE CONDUCTED TWO

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:21.050
RECENT STUDIES AND CALIFORNIA

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:23.619
NURSING HOMES SHOWING THAT

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:25.588
NURSE STAFFING LEVELS ARE THE

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:27.990
MAJOR FACTORS THAT PREVENT

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.125
COBIT INFECTIONS AND DEATHS

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:33.162
HIGHER TOTAL STAFFING HOURS

01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:35.831
AND ARE IN HOURS REDUCE

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.633
COVET INFECTION AND DEATH

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.170
RATES BY HALF WE FOUND THAT

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:43.439
CALIFORNIA'S MINIMUM STAFFING

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:46.075
STANDARD OF THREE POINT FIVE

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:48.611
HOURS PER RESIDENT PER DAY

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:51.513
IS SIMPLY TOO LOW TO PROTECT

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.583
RESIDENTS WE URGE INCREASING

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:56.251
THE STATE'S MINIMUM STAFFING

01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:59.521
LAW TO FOUR POINT ONE HOURS PER

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:02.091
RESIDENT DAY FOR TOTAL NURSING

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.727
INCLUDING FORTY FIVE MINUTES

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:07.296
OF OUR IN TIME AND TWENTY

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:09.999
FOUR HOUR ARE IN COVERAGE

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:13.369
WE ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.471
ELIMINATING ALL STAFFING

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:18.007
WAIVERS WHICH ONLY SERVED

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:21.377
TO REDUCE AND KEEP WAGES LOW

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.414
IN ADDITION A WE FOUND THAT

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.349
NURSING HOMES WITH OVER FIFTY

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:30.285
PERCENT TURNOVER RATES HAD

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:32.621
THIRTY PERCENT MORE WORDS

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:34.390
THIRTY PORT PERCENT MORE

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:36.725
LIKELY TO HAVE HIGHER INFECTION

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:41.130
RATES WE URGE REQUIRING A

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.699
FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:46.135
NURSING ASSISTANT WAGES IN

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:48.470
THE COMING YEAR TO REDUCE

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:51.540
TURNOVER TO REDUCE THE STAFFING

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:54.143
SHORTAGES AND PREVENT WORKERS

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.345
FROM WORKING IN MULTIPLE

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:58.747
DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND TO

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:00.749
INCREASE WORK PRODUCTIVITY

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:04.920
SECOND EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.322
CALIFORNIA FOR PROFIT NURSING

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:09.958

01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:12.127
HIGHER COALBED INFECTION

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:14.897
RATES COMPARED TO NON PROFIT

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:17.299
AND GOVERNMENT FACILITIES

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:20.102
PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.237
NOT SPENDING ADEQUATE AMOUNTS

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:24.807
OF DIRECT CARE SERVICES SO WE

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:27.576
HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ONE

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:30.212
REQUIRING THAT NURSING HOMES

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:33.148

AND PROFITS ON THE ENTIRE

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:58.140
NURSING HOME COMPANY SO THAT

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.442
THE REMAINING FUNDS CAN BE USED

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:03.178
FOR DIRECT CARE SERVICES NEW

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:35.210
TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN HEALTH

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.978
CARE WORKERS IN ADDITION

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:38.480
THE STATE NEEDS TO ASSIST

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.348
FACILITIES IN RECRUITING AND

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:41.750
RETAINING OF THE NEEDS OF WORK

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:43.451
FORCE -- THROUGH WORKFORCE

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:45.720
DEVELOPMENT FINALLY BEYOND

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:46.955
LOOKING AT MORE ADEQUATE

01:23:47.021 --> 01:23:48.289
MEDICAL HEALTH FINANCING FOR

01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:50.258
LABOR COST WE WANT TO SUGGEST

01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:52.494
A COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS --

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.661
GOING FORWARD THAT WOULD HAVE

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:55.597
AN IMMEDIATE POSITIVE IMPACT

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:56.998
CONTINUING TO PRIORITIZE

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:58.933
NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS AND

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.535
STAFF IN EVERYTHING THAT THE

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.570
STATE DOES OF THIS WILL INCLUDE

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:03.905
THE VACCINE THE DISTRIBUTION

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:04.939
OF THE VACCINE AND I CAN

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:06.040
TALK MORE ABOUT THAT AND THE

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:07.108
QUESTIONS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:08.877
POSITIVE THINGS HAPPENING AT

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.879
TO PREPARE FOR THE VACCINE

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:12.147
INCREASING THE ACCESS OF

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:13.648
NURSING FACILITIES TO TESTING

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:14.983
KITS THAT PROVIDE TIMELY

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:16.584
RESULTS ALTHOUGH TESTING IS

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:17.719
GETTING BETTER THERE ARE STILL

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:19.788
HURDLES AND COST CONSTRAINTS

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:21.923
ALSO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:24.125
A FEW OTHER THINGS FOR THE

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:25.560
PURPOSES OF ITS EXISTING AND

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:27.829
PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY ALSO RIGHT

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.497
NOW THERE IS NO CLEAR WEBSITE

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.132
WHERE ANYONE CAN ACCESS ALL

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:32.801
FEDERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:34.369
AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS IN ONE

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:36.171
PLACE WE HAVE URGED THE STATE

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.072
TO DIVERT TO DEVELOP SUCH

01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:40.008
SUCH A UP A PORTAL SO EVERYONE

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:41.776
CAN UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING AT

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:44.245
ONCE IN ONE PLACE A DEDICATED

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:47.482
PP FOR SKILLED NURSING HOME

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:48.917
CARE WORKERS IT'S GOING TO

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:50.618
BE IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.454
AS WE WILL SEE GAPS PROBABLY

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.222
CONTINUE IN THE AVAILABILITY

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.391
OF EQUIPMENT AND LASTLY BUT NO

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:57.759
LESS IMPORTANT THE STATE MUST

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:58.993
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR NURSING

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.628
FACILITIES TO COVER THE COST

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:02.597
ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:04.632
LIABILITY AND WORKERS COMP

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.534
RATES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.136
NURSING FACILITIES RATES ARE

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.804
SKYROCKETING FOR PANDEMIC

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:12.407
COVERAGE AND WHAT IT AND THAT

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:13.575
WHEN THEY ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:15.176
EVEN BE ABLE TO FIND INSURANCE

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:17.545
COVERAGE IN MOST CASES --

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:18.713
FACILITIES ARE NOT FINDING

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.114
CHARACTER CARRIERS THAT WILL

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:21.649
COVER THEIR LIABILITY OR THEIR

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.551
WORKERS COMP RISK RELATED TO

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.153
COPE WITH THE LAST POINT I

ENTIRE HEALTHCARE PROVISION OF

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.229
PROFESSION IS STILL LEARNING

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.030
A LOT ABOUT THE DISEASE HOW IT

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:37.966
SPREADS AND HOW TO CONTAIN IT

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:39.467
UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER SNIFFS

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:41.135

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:43.131
CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:45.633
LACK OF VISITATION HAS HAD ON

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:46.868
THE EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:49.304
PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:50.572
RESIDENTS OF THESE FACILITIES

CDPH HAS SOME DATA ON THOSE

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:56.978
STATISTICS -- AND EFFECTIVE

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.179
IS THE LACK OF THE STATIONS

01:26:58.246 --> 01:26:59.881
HAD ON THEM I BECAUSE I HAVE

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.616

AND THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM --

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:11.993
TO LOOK AT DATA -- ONE OF THE

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.494
PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'VE HAD

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:14.862

THAT EITHER HAPPENED BACK IN

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:24.572
ITS FACILITIES OR WE ARE ALSO

01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:26.174
PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.809
TO THE OMBUDSMAN SO THAT THEY

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.677
CAN GET INTO THE FACILITIES --

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:32.080
AND SEE IF WE CAN GO ON OUT ANY

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:34.148
TYPES OF QUALITY OF CARE DATA

01:27:34.215 --> 01:27:36.217
EXCEPT TRUCK -- WE ALSO WHEN WE

GO INTO FACILITIES AS LICENSE

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:40.622
-- AND CERTIFICATION SURVEYORS

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:41.689
WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AND

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:42.857
FACTION PREVENTION WHEN WE'RE

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:44.425
THERE WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:45.960
ARE THERE ISSUES WITH QUALITY

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:46.928
OF CARE OTHER ISSUES WITH

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:49.030
LEADERSHIP OTHER ISSUES WITH --

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.632
WITH NUTRITION AND THERE HAVE

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:51.899
BEEN MANY CITATIONS THAT WE'VE

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:53.968
GIVEN THROUGHOUT -- THE COURSE

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:55.770
THE PANDEMIC OR HAD TO TAKE

01:27:55.837 --> 01:27:57.772
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE OPTIONS

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.140
-- LIKE PUTTING IN TEMPORARY

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:01.709
MANAGERS -- OR DOING -- ARE

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:03.611
REVOCATION EXCEPT TRACK ON TO

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:05.279
THOSE SITUATIONS BUT ONE OF

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.581
THE THINGS THAT DOES GIVE ME

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.750
A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE -- AFTER

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.685
-- YOU KNOW FOR YOUR QUESTION

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:11.986
ABOUT WHAT ARE THE LONG

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:13.488
TERM EFFECTS OF SOME OF THIS

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:15.289
ISOLATION AS WE WERE LOOKING AT

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:17.058
OVERALL MORTALITY RATE TO SEE

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.193
IF THE OVERALL MORTALITY RATE

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:21.562
IS HIGHER THIS YEAR -- AND THEN

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:23.164
LAST YEAR OR IN PREVIOUS YEARS

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:24.766
AND LOOKING AT WHAT THE EFFECTS

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:25.967
OF YOU KNOW COPD MORTALITY

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:28.236
VERSUS OVERALL MORTALITY -- WE

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:30.571
ARE SEEN LOW RATES AND LOWER

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:33.408
RATES OF MORTALITY IN OUR AND

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:34.976
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:37.145
-- BUT WE THINK THAT THAT

01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:38.713
COULD BE BECAUSE THE INFECTION

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.548
CONTROL PRACTICES ARE SO MUCH

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.884
GREATER NOW THAT PERHAPS --

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.352
PEOPLE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:46.220
OTHER POTENTIAL YOU KNOW AS

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:47.255
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES WITH

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:48.690
THEN AND AND OTHER THINGS

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:51.659
THAT CAN CAN HAPPEN -- BUT

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.194
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:55.196
AREN'T ISSUES WE ARE TRACKING

01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:56.831
WHAT TYPES OF COMPLAINTS WERE

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:58.199
RECEIVING AS WELL AS FACILITY

01:28:58.266 --> 01:29:01.035
REPORTED INCIDENCES ON AND

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:02.603
MOST OF OUR COMPLAINTS AROUND

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.239
THIS TATIAN -- AND AS I SAID

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:07.175
IN MY TESTIMONY ONE OF THE

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:09.010
THINGS THAT WAS A FACTOR IS

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:10.511
THAT WHEN WE ISSUED AND RE

01:29:10.578 --> 01:29:12.380
OPENED FACILITIES ON JUNE

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:15.216
TWENTY SIX -- THE STATE MIGHT

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.417
HAVE YOU KNOW SAID HEY WE'RE

01:29:16.484 --> 01:29:18.319
REOPENING REQUIRING VISITATION

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.988
BUT MANY LOCAL CUT CUT PUBLIC

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:22.757
AND HEALTH OFFICERS HAD

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:25.193
MORE STE -- STRICTER LOCAL

01:29:25.259 --> 01:29:26.461
PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS THAT

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:27.829
RESTRICTED ON BUSSMANN --

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:30.098
WOULD RESTRICT VISITATION ON

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:32.633
AND SO WHEN THOSE CAME OUT --

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.502
WE THEN STARTED TO MEET WITH

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:35.770
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ONE

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.872
ON ONE TALK THROUGH WHAT THE

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:39.574
CONCERNS WERE BECAUSE WE DO

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.008
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ISOLATION

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:42.477
AND OF COURSE THEY DO AS WELL

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:43.411
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO PARTNER

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:44.812
TOGETHER ON THE SCIENCE AND

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:47.381
USING SCIENCE BASED PRACTICES

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:49.283
TO SAY HEY VISITATION SHOULD

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:51.519
BE A REQUIREMENT IS IS PATIENT

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:53.187
RIGHT -- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:54.122
SURE THAT WE HAVE C.

01:29:54.188 --> 01:29:55.890
PROTOCOL TO DO SO SO THAT'S

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:58.092
WHY BEFORE WE ISSUE THE SECOND

01:29:58.159 --> 01:30:00.094
VISITATION AFL TO RE OPENED

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:02.029
FURTHER WE DID A DIFFERENT

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:03.531
PRACTICE WE FIRST MET WITH

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:05.199
ALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:06.801
ASKED FOR THEIR FEEDBACK

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:08.436
AND SO WHEN WE ISSUE THAT ON

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:10.271
FRIDAY OUR HOPE IS THAT OVER

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:12.373
THE NEXT WEEK OR SO WE HOPE

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.808
THAT THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:15.643
-- OFFICERS THAT HAVE --

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.445
STRICTER GUIDELINES WELL NOW

01:30:17.512 --> 01:30:18.980
-- MORE ALIGNED THEMSELVES

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:20.381
WITH THE STATE RE OPENING

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:22.250
BUT AGAIN WITH SAFE PRACTICES

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:23.317
AND PROTOCOLS THAT WE HAVE

01:30:23.384 --> 01:30:25.753
LISTED OUT IN OUR POLICY THANK

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.989
YOU ARE THE REASON I RAISE

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:30.391
THE ISSUE IS THAT I HAVE HAD

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:31.759
PERSONAL CONTACT FROM QUITE

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:33.227
A FEW CONSTITUENTS BUT I'M

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:34.428
SURE PROBABLY EVERYONE ON THIS

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:36.631
DíAS HAS WELL VERY CONCERNED

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:37.665
ABOUT LOVED ONES THAT ARE IN

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.367
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:41.435
THEY ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:44.705
VISITATION WITH AND -- I DO

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:45.907
NOT SHARE YOUR CONFIDENCE

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:47.742
THAT THE ABRIDGEMENT ARE GOING

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:49.911
TO BE ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT THE

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:51.279
EXTENT OF THIS EMOTIONAL AND

01:30:51.345 --> 01:30:52.513
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.448
THE DATA THAT I HAVE SAYS THAT

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:56.350
WE HAD ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:57.785
A BUNCH BEEN VISITS TO SKILLED

01:30:57.852 --> 01:30:59.854
NURSING FACILITIES A YEAR AGO

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:01.389
IN OCTOBER AND THAT THIS MONTH

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:03.724
IT'S BEEN AROUND A THOUSAND SO

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:04.892
I'M CONCERNED THAT WE MIGHT NOT

01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:07.795
BE GETTING THE FULL PICTURE OF

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:09.630
HOW PERVASIVE THIS PROBLEM IS

01:31:09.697 --> 01:31:10.731
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S SOMETHING

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:11.699
THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE VERY

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:13.501
CONCERNED ABOUT SO I DON'T HAVE

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:14.769
TO ASK IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:16.237
ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:18.105
THERE IS PROBABLY A PROTOCOL

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.740
THE CAN BE ESTABLISHED THAT

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:21.375
THAT -- ENHANCES VISITATION

01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:22.410
WHILE STILL PROTECTING THE

01:31:22.476 --> 01:31:23.845
HEALTH OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE

01:31:23.911 --> 01:31:26.547
FACILITY A GREAT GREAT ALSO

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:28.082
MY SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:30.051
THE STATE'S VA FACILITIES

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:32.453
-- I KNOW THAT THEY SERVE --

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.622
VERY LARGE POPULATION IN THEIR

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:35.756
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.024
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:38.359
WE'VE HAD ANY MAJOR COVERT

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:39.560
OUTBREAKS IN THOSE FACILITIES

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:41.262
AND I WONDER IF YOU CAN TALK

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.564
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THAT IS

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:44.999
AND WHAT IT WHAT DISPARITIES

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:46.234
MIGHT EXIST BETWEEN THE VA

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.168
AND THE OTHER SKILLED NURSING

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:48.069
FACILITIES IN THE STATES

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:51.138
BECAUSE I FOUND THAT VERY ODD

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.641
THAT'S AN INTERESTING

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:55.910
OBSERVATION -- ABOUT THE THAT

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:57.211
THE ACE I CAN TAKE THAT BACK

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.613
AND LOOK MORE INTO THAT DETAIL

01:31:58.679 --> 01:31:59.580
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:01.215
PULL THAT TO PULL THE DATA ON

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:02.450
THAT TO SEE BECAUSE I DON'T

01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:03.618
HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION AT

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:04.685
THIS TIME TO BE ABLE TO KIND

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:06.721
OF SPEAK TO WHY THAT MAY BE A

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:08.890
WAY THAT NOT BE IT MAY BE --

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:10.358
BUT I WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:11.993
BACK IS IT IS IT SOMETHING TO

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:14.562
LOOK INTO FOR OUR ANALYTICS

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:16.564
OKAY WELL THANK YOU AND IF YOU

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:18.032
CAN CALL MY OFFICE ON THAT I

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:20.034
I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THAT

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.702
YEAH NOW THAT IS INTERESTING

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:22.770
THAT AND IF THERE MIGHT BE

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:23.738
SOME GOOD LESSONS LEARNED

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:24.639
THERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THOSE

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:25.740
FACILITIES ARE DOING SOMETHING

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:26.807
RIGHT IF WE'RE NOT SEEING THE

01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:28.376
SAME DEGREE OF OPERATE THERE

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:31.445

WORKING IN A SNAP I THINK IT'S

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:48.095
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THOSE

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:49.397
WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES

01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:51.499
HAVING BEEN A PROVIDER MYSELF I

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:53.968
UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE WHAT

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:55.670
PANDEMIC FATIGUE LOOKS LIKE

01:32:55.736 --> 01:32:57.538
AND OFTEN TIMES THAT'S WHEN

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.907
WE DON'T START APPRECIATING

01:32:59.974 --> 01:33:01.375
THOSE WERE WORKING SO HARD

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:03.644
RIGHT NOW SO MARIA CARMEN I

STARTED THIS PANDEMIC AND I

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:22.930
THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:24.699
TOWARDS WAYS WE CAN SUPPORT

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:26.634

TO THE SECTOR BUT IT'S NOT

01:33:58.466 --> 01:33:59.800
JUST US IT'S ALL PRETTY

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:02.169
MUCH EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:03.371
HEALTHCARE SECTOR RIGHT NOW

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:05.573
WORKFORCE IS A MAJOR ISSUE -- I

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.141
WAS A MEMBER OF THE MASTER PLAN

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:08.909
FOR AGING STAKEHOLDER GROUP

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.378
THAT IS JUST FINISH AT WORK AND

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:11.645
THERE'S A MAJOR SECTION THERE

01:34:11.712 --> 01:34:13.214
ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:34:13.447 --> 01:34:14.915
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE ALMOST A

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:17.718
NATIONAL OR OUR STATE STATEWIDE

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:19.720
EFFORT IN TERMS OF TRAINING

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:21.222
BRINGING IN MORE HEALTHCARE

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.024
WORKERS ESPECIALLY C.

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.657
N.

01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:24.592
A.'S BUT REALLY IN THE NURSING

01:34:24.658 --> 01:34:26.761
AND AND THE LPN AND RN --

01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:28.396
AREAS AS WELL -- AND YOU'VE

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:30.431
ALSO HEARD TODAY THAT THE SOME

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.533
OF THE IDEAS OF PUTTING MORE

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.301
MONEY IN FOR PAY FACILITIES

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:35.469
WOULD LOVE VERY MUCH TO BE

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:36.737
ABLE TO PAY MORE BUT AT THIS

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:37.938
POINT THERE THEY WILL NEED TO

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:40.141
HAVE INCREASES IN RATES TO DO

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:42.143
THAT -- THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE

01:34:42.209 --> 01:34:43.144
JUST NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.945
SYSTEM TO DO THAT -- I KNOW

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.213
THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE AT THE

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.382
FEDERAL LEVEL -- RIGHT NOW AND

01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:49.917
RIGHT NOW AS WELL I WOULD JUST

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:51.619
POINT OUT CALF FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:34:51.685 --> 01:34:54.021
HAD A -- A GRANT RECENTLY TO

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.990
ESTABLISH MORSE FACILITY BASED

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:57.792
WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS

01:34:57.858 --> 01:34:59.393
THAT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.561
BUT WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND THE

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:02.163
CURVE ON THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:03.397
TAKE IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:04.432
THE NOTION OF BEING ABLE TO

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:06.100
INCREASE THE WORKFORCE IN A

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:08.402
REALLY FAST WAY IS I THINK

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:10.071
IT'S VERY DAY DIFFICULT TO

01:35:10.137 --> 01:35:12.440
MATCH BECAUSE THE STATE AND IN

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:13.841
THIS QUESTION WILL BE DIRECTED

01:35:13.908 --> 01:35:16.043
TOWARDS -- THE STATE BUT WHAT

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:17.044
HAVE WE EVER LOOKED AT ANY

01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:19.113
OUTRAGE OR PR CAMPAIGNS THAT

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.749
MAY HELP US TO RECRUIT MORE

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:23.851
PEOPLE INTO CNA'S -- I THINK

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:25.820
IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:27.588
NOW AS WE LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:29.690
CONDITIONS OF OUR STATE TO BE

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:31.892
PROVIDING PATHWAYS FOR MANY

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:33.294
PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE CULTURAL

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.029
OR LINGUISTIC COMPETENCIES

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.233
HI THIS IS A SENATOR FROM

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.301
CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:43.037
HEALTH AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:45.372
PUT INTO PLACE I'M TAKING A

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:46.640
LOOK AT ALL THE DATA BASE FROM

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:48.642
PREVIOUS CNA'S THAT WE HAVE

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:50.511
AND TRYING TO MATCH THEM TO

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.179
FACILITIES WHERE WE SAY THAT

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:53.114
THERE ARE OPENINGS WE KNOW

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.215
THAT THERE'S REGION'S THAT NEED

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:55.950
MORE STAFFING -- WE'VE DONE

01:35:56.016 --> 01:35:57.051
SOME CREATIVE THINGS AROUND

01:35:57.118 --> 01:35:58.219
THAT AROUND THE PANDEMIC BUT

01:35:58.285 --> 01:35:59.720
WHEN IT COMES TO -- KIND OF

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:01.889
PR CAMPAIGNS I'M ONE OF THE

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:03.090
THINGS I WOULD LOVE TO WORK

TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT THEIR

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:13.667
PROGRAM DOES BECAUSE ONE OF

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:14.802
THE THINGS I'VE NOTICED THAT

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:17.071
WE NEED TO DO AS A STATE IS

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:18.606
EVEN PARTNER BEYOND PUBLIC

01:36:18.672 --> 01:36:19.773

THE AGENDA IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT

01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:07.581
APPROXIMATELY SIXTY PERCENT

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:09.182
NATIONALLY IS WHAT THE AVERAGES

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:11.084
FOR WORK FORCE OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.019
IS LEADING THE WAY ON THAT

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:14.021
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I'M

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:15.322
FINAL QUESTION IF I CAN FROM

01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:17.057
THE STEIN OCCUR AND -- I'M I

01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:19.526
AM TRYING TO THINK A STEP AHEAD

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:23.730
AND -- IF NOT IF WHEN WE HAVE

01:43:23.797 --> 01:43:26.600
A COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE I

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:27.701
THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:30.137
DISCUSSION ABOUT PRIORITIZATION

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:33.040
AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:34.908
CONVERSATION FOR US TO THINK

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:38.712
ABOUT SHOULD WE BE PUSHING OUR

01:43:38.779 --> 01:43:40.414
FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE FRONT

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.616
OF THE LINE BUT I BELIEVE WE

01:43:42.683 --> 01:43:43.650
ALSO NEED TO LOOK TOWARDS OUR

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.218
CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS ARE

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:48.021
SNAPS AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:53.260
-- -- -- HI STEIN OCCUR WHAT

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:55.295
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER OR NOT

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:57.864
-- SNAPS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED

01:43:57.931 --> 01:44:01.068
AND KOPEN VACCINATIONS WELL

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:03.470
ABSOLUTELY AND -- WE DO HAVE A

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:05.405
A VACCINE WORK FORCE TASK FORCE

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:07.441
RIGHT NOW -- THAT IS LOOKING

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:08.542
AT ALL THE PRIORITIZATION

01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:09.476
IS ACROSS ALL OF OUR HEALTH

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:10.777
CARE FACILITIES AS WELL AS

01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:11.878
LOOKING AT WHO ARE THE MOST

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:14.181
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS -- THE

01:44:14.247 --> 01:44:15.782
VACCINE OBVIOUSLY MANY OF THE

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:17.150
DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF VACCINES

01:44:17.217 --> 01:44:19.686
RIGHT NOW -- DO PRESENT SOME

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:21.488
-- OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION

01:44:21.555 --> 01:44:23.590
CHALLENGES -- FOR EXAMPLE EVEN

01:44:23.657 --> 01:44:25.025
THE FIZER VACCINE THAT HAS TO

01:44:25.092 --> 01:44:26.893
BE -- STORED AT SUB SEVENTY

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:29.296
DEGREES -- AND THEN CAN ONLY

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:30.797
HAVE LIKE A TWELVE HOUR THOUGHT

01:44:30.864 --> 01:44:32.799
TIME BEFORE THEN YOU CAN --

01:44:32.866 --> 01:44:34.468
YOU KNOW VACCINATE OTHERWISE

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:36.336
IT'S A LONGER EFFICACIOUS --

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:37.971
SOME HAVE THERE IS LEVELS OF

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:39.740
EFFICACY FOR DIFFERENT TYPES

01:44:39.806 --> 01:44:41.775
OF POPULATIONS INCLUDING --

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.243
MANY WHO WOULD RESIDE IN A

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:45.178
SKILLED NURSING FACILITY --

01:44:45.245 --> 01:44:46.747
AND SO I THINK THE IMPORTANT

01:44:46.813 --> 01:44:47.681
MESSAGE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:49.883
HAVE TO COME OUT VERY STRONGLY

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:51.985

HAVE HAD -- COME CAMPAIGNS AND

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:55.822
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:57.758
IT IS THAT YOU MASK EVEN IF

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:59.893
YOU'RE YOUNG TWENTY THIRTY

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.428
HEALTHY YEAR OLD YOU KNOW

01:45:01.495 --> 01:45:03.030
OUT THERE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:05.198
YOU ABIDE AND YOUR DECISIONS

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.466
AND WEARING A MASK IN WHAT

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:08.435
YOU CHOOSE TO DO TO REMAIN

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:10.003
PHYSICALLY DISTANCE AND NOT DO

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:11.438
THESE HUGE GATHERINGS AND AND

01:45:11.505 --> 01:45:14.374
SUCH THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS --

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:15.809

THOSE WHO ON THE VACCINE MIGHT

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:29.456
NOT BE AS EFFICACIOUS FOR SO

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:30.390
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KIND

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:31.491
OF LOOK AT IT NOT JUST FROM

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:33.493
A PRIORITY TO GET THE VACCINE

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.662

IN REAL TIME IT GETS CORRELATED

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:35.842
WITH OTHER HIGH RISK INDICATOR

01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:37.243
DATA THAT WE HAVE COMPILED

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:39.479
WE -- COMPARE IT WITH -- THE

PAST THREE YEARS OF COMPLIANCE

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:41.915

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:44.884
THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:46.719
GETS PUT IN THE ALGORITHM ANY

01:53:46.786 --> 01:53:48.087
OUTBREAKS WITHIN A FIVE MILE

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.656
RADIUS ANY WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:51.191

01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:56.863
CONSIDERED HIGH RISK ANYONE

WHO'S HAVING THEIR VERY FIRST

01:53:58.364 --> 01:53:59.899
CASE EVEN IF IT'S JUST ONE

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:01.367
CASE AND IT'S EITHER RESIDENT

01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:03.169
OR STAFF THAT TRIGGERS US

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:04.871
TO IMMEDIATELY GO IN AS WELL

01:54:04.938 --> 01:54:06.539
BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND THAT EVEN

01:54:06.606 --> 01:54:08.074
THOUGH SOMEONE HAS THE BEST

01:54:08.141 --> 01:54:10.376
LAID PLANS AND WE'VE APPROVED

01:54:10.443 --> 01:54:12.111

THEIR THEIR MITIGATION PLANS

01:54:13.813 --> 01:54:15.648

THEIR PLANS INTO THEIR PLANS

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:24.290
AND EXECUTE THEM PERFECTLY

01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:26.159
OR THERE COULD BE A FIGHT OR

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:27.794
FLIGHT SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:29.896
FEAR OR PEOPLE START TO CALL IN

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:30.897
OR THERE COULD BE OTHER ISSUES

01:54:30.964 --> 01:54:32.899
THAT HAPPENED SO -- THAT'S WHY

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:34.601
EVEN JUST HAVING ONE BRAND NEW

01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:36.603
CASE THAT WORD SET AN IMMEDIATE

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.538
VISIT AND ENTER INTERVENTION

01:54:38.605 --> 01:54:41.674

01:54:41.741 --> 01:54:42.609
IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE

01:54:42.675 --> 01:54:43.543
LOTS OF DIFFERENT HIGH RISK

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:45.612
INDICATORS THAT WE'VE ADDED AND

01:54:45.678 --> 01:54:47.413
WILL CONTINUE TO ADD IN ONE OF

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:49.215
THE THINGS THAT JUST RECENTLY

01:54:49.282 --> 01:54:50.650
HAPPENED AS WE RECENTLY FOUND

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:52.151
THAT THERE WERE SOME CITATIONS

01:54:52.218 --> 01:54:54.153
ARE ROOT CAUSES OF FOR EXAMPLE

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.322
-- A FACILITY NOT FIT TESTING

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.391
THEIR STAFF AND THAT'S A CAL

01:54:58.458 --> 01:54:59.892
OSHA REAGAN SO WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:54:59.959 --> 01:55:01.761
NOW IS SEEN OKAY WE HAVE ACCESS

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:03.563
TO OUR COMPLIANCE DATA BUT IF

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:05.265
WE CAN PARTNER ACROSS DIFFERENT

DEPARTMENTS TO SEE WHAT OTHER

01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:08.001
REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT ARE

ALSO IN THESE FACILITIES IF WE

01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:12.405
CAN PARTNER AND SHARE ALL OTHER

01:55:12.472 --> 01:55:13.873
COMPLIANCE DATA THAT WOULD ALSO

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.275
BE A HIGH RISK INDICATOR TO

01:55:15.341 --> 01:55:17.910
BE ABLE TO INTERVENE PERFECT

01:55:17.977 --> 01:55:19.078

01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:49.208
STATUS OF TESTING KITS FOR --

01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:51.444
RESIDENTS AND STAFF I KNOW THAT

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:52.845
WE WERE KIND OF SHORT I MEAN

01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:54.314
WE WE KIND OF WERE SHORTAGE

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:55.548
OF TESTING KITS IN THE MIDDLE

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.250
THE PANDEMIC AND THEN AND NOW

01:55:57.317 --> 01:55:58.851
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ENOUGH IS

01:55:58.918 --> 01:56:00.153
THAT TRUE DO WE HAVE ENOUGH TO

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:02.255
DO TESTING ON A REGULAR BASIS

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:03.690
TO MEET THE ONE WEEK TWO WEEK

01:56:03.756 --> 01:56:06.993
TURNAROUND YEAH WE DO WE RIGHT

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.594
NOW WE HAVE WEEKLY TESTING

01:56:08.661 --> 01:56:11.631
IN CALIFORNIA -- SO WE ARE I

01:56:11.698 --> 01:56:12.832
WOULD SAY VERY AGGRESSIVE IN

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:14.133
CALIFORNIA WITH THEIR TESTING

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:17.003
CMS -- -- DID NOT STATE THAT

01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:18.905
TESTING WEEKLY WAS NECESSARY

01:56:18.971 --> 01:56:20.373
IN ALL COUNTIES BUT WE FELT

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:21.841
TO BE MORE PREVENTIVE GOING

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:24.143
INTO THE WINTER SEASON WE

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:25.445
REQUIRE THAT EVERYONE TOSSED

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.847
OUT WEEKLY BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE

01:56:27.914 --> 01:56:29.415
THE CAPACITY FOR THAT SAID THIS

01:56:29.482 --> 01:56:31.117
WEEK ALSO ACTUALLY NOVEMBER

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:32.952
FIRST WE RE OPEN OR WE WILL

01:56:33.019 --> 01:56:34.387
BE OPENING OUR FIRST STATE

01:56:34.454 --> 01:56:37.023
RUN -- LAB WHICH IS PERKIN

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.891
ELMER -- AND THEY WILL START

01:56:38.958 --> 01:56:40.059
WITH THE CAPACITY OF FORTY

01:56:40.126 --> 01:56:41.994
THOUSAND TESTS A DAY AND BUILD

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:43.529
UP OVER THE NEXT MONTHS UP TO

01:56:43.596 --> 01:56:44.731
YOU KNOW UPWARDS TWO HUNDRED

01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:46.566
FIFTY THOUSAND TESTS A DAY

01:56:46.632 --> 01:56:48.701
-- AND THAT ON TOP OF ALREADY

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.770
OUR EXISTING CAPACITY -- SO

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:52.705
THAT WE CAN EXPAND TESTING --

01:56:52.772 --> 01:56:54.440
THROUGHOUT THE WINTER MONTHS

01:56:54.507 --> 01:56:55.575
AND GREG DO YOU DID DO YOUR

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:57.076
FACILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO

01:56:57.143 --> 01:56:58.077
ALL THESE TESTS ARE THEY ARE

01:56:58.144 --> 01:56:59.846
THEY COMFORTABLE IN TERMS OF

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:01.347
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:02.849
THEY THEY ARE DEFINITELY BETTER

01:57:02.915 --> 01:57:04.250
OFF THAN THEY WERE AT THE THE

01:57:04.317 --> 01:57:06.185
PC ARE AT AND YOU KNOW AS YOU

01:57:06.252 --> 01:57:07.120
AS YOU THINK YOU KNOW MISSED

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:08.755
FONG THERE'S THERE'S THE PCR

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.223
TEST WHICH IS THE GOLD STANDARD

01:57:10.289 --> 01:57:11.758
WHICH IS WHAT CDPH REALLY

01:57:11.824 --> 01:57:13.526
WANTS THE THE TURN AROUND

01:57:13.593 --> 01:57:14.894
TIME ON THOSE CAST IS IMPROVED

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:15.995
DRAMATICALLY AND AND THEY

01:57:16.062 --> 01:57:17.463
ARE ABLE TO GET THOSE IN MUCH

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:18.965
BETTER WAY THERE ARE CHALLENGES

01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:20.566
STILL HERE THOUGH I WOULD SAY

01:57:20.633 --> 01:57:21.868
FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE HELP

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:23.436
SOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:26.038
REQUIRED THE THE STAFF TO GO TO

01:57:26.105 --> 01:57:28.341
THEIR SITE TO BE TESTED VERSUS

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:29.709
HAVING THE FACILITY TAKE DO

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:31.144
THE TEST AND HOUSE AND SENDING

01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:33.146
IT TO THE LAB SO THAT THAT

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:34.380
TAKES TIME OFF OF THE STAFF

01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:36.282
TIME TO GET THEMSELVES TESTED

01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:37.650
SOME WAYS THE OTHER THING I

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:39.051
WOULD JUST MENTION TO YOU IS

01:57:39.118 --> 01:57:40.420
IN A NUMBER OF STATES THEY

01:57:40.486 --> 01:57:41.988
ARE ALLOWING THE USE OF THE

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:43.689
ANTIGEN TEST AND YOU KNOW THE

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:45.858
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SENT ANTIGEN

01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:47.627
TEST MACHINES EVERY FACILITY

01:57:47.693 --> 01:57:49.662
IN THE COUNTRY AND THOSE ARE

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:51.497
-- THOSE THOSE HAVE VERY RAPID

01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:53.366
TURNAROUND BUT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:54.667
THAT THE ACCURACY LEVEL IS

01:57:54.734 --> 01:57:56.002
NOT IS NOT AS GOOD AS A GOOD

01:57:56.068 --> 01:57:57.336
TURNAROUND IS LIKE FIFTEEN

01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:59.138
MINUTES OR LESS ALSO MOST

01:57:59.205 --> 01:58:00.773
FACILITIES ARE NOT UTILIZING

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:01.674
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:03.576
HAS HAS PROVIDED THEM IN THAT

01:58:03.643 --> 01:58:05.511
AREA ARENA BECAUSE THE YET THE

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:08.381
STANDARD CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER I

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:10.817
WOULD SAY IT'S ARTICLE IT'S ART

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:14.387
I I JUST I THINK THAT THE PCR

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:16.055
TEST IS THE GOLD STANDARD AND

01:58:16.122 --> 01:58:18.357
SO IF SOMEONE TEST UNDER THAT

01:58:18.424 --> 01:58:20.660
CDPH GUIDANCE IF SOMEONE TESTS

01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:21.761
NEGATIVE THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW

01:58:21.828 --> 01:58:23.963
UP WITH PCR TEST ANYWAY SO THEY

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:25.465
TEST NEGATIVE WITH THE WITH THE

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:26.499
ANTIGEN TEST THEY STILL HAVE

01:58:26.566 --> 01:58:28.968
TO GO GET A PCR TEST SO -- YEAH

01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:30.503
THE PCR WOULD BE IS PREFERABLE

01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:32.438
BUT IT IS MUCH MORE COSTLY AND

01:58:32.505 --> 01:58:33.973
IT IS IT DOES TAKE MORE TIME

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.775
AND AND SO I THINK THAT IT IS

01:58:35.842 --> 01:58:37.210
IMPROVED BUT IT COULD GO IT

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:38.611
COULD GET BETTER AND IT'S HEIDI

01:58:38.678 --> 01:58:40.613
SAID THAT THE PERKIN ELMER LAB

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.315
WE WOULD WE WERE HOPING THAT

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:43.516
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

01:58:43.583 --> 01:58:45.017
WILL BE A PRIORITY FOR THE USE

01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:46.586
OF THIS PERKINELMER LAB THAT

01:58:46.652 --> 01:58:48.521
THE STATE HAS CONTRACTED WITH

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:49.455
IT'S GOING TO TURN AROUND A

01:58:49.522 --> 01:58:50.990
HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TEST

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:53.125
DAY I BELIEVE -- AND SO WE'RE

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:54.227
HOPING THAT SKILLED NURSING

01:58:54.293 --> 01:58:55.595
FACILITIES AND OTHER CONGREGATE

01:58:55.661 --> 01:58:56.696
CARE FACILITIES COULD BE PART

01:58:56.762 --> 01:58:59.265
OF THAT IS THE PREFERENCE --

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:01.167
TWO TESTS AT THE FACILITY I

01:59:01.234 --> 01:59:02.602
MEAN WHAT A MOBILE UNIT IS

01:59:02.668 --> 01:59:04.437
THAT THE YOUR IS THAT THE

01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:06.572
YES FROM ME MEMBERS OKAY YES

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.007
DEFINITELY BECAUSE IT IS THE I

01:59:08.074 --> 01:59:09.175
THINK THAT IT THAT IS SIMPLER

01:59:09.242 --> 01:59:10.510
IN SO MANY WAYS TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:10.576 --> 01:59:13.045
TEST AT THE FACILITY AB VERSES

01:59:13.112 --> 01:59:14.580
THAT STAFF HAVING TO LEAVE THE

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:17.383
FACILITY OR TO GO TO ENOUGH

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:19.552
KAISER FOR EXAMPLE -- TO TAP

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:20.987
THEIR TEST -- IT WOULD BE MUCH

01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:21.888
EASIER IF THEY COULD DO THAT

01:59:21.954 --> 01:59:23.589
IN HOUSE AT SOME FACILITIES

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:24.824
CAN DO THAT SOME COULD NOT BUT

01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:26.659
AS YOU KNOW -- THE STATE IS

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:28.094
REQUIRED TO HEALTH PLANS TO

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.428
PAY FOR THE TESTING FOR THEIR

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:32.698
FOR A FOREIGN WORKERS AND AND

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:34.233
SOME OF THE HEALTH PLANS JUST

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:35.935
REQUIRED FOR THAT STAFF TO

01:59:36.002 --> 01:59:37.336
REQUIRE THEIR PEOPLE COME TO

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:39.539
THE THEIR FACILITY FOR TESTING

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:40.840
AND JUST LAST I GUESS THE LAST

01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:43.743
QUESTION TO THE SENATOR IS IN

01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:45.244
TERMS OF THIS HEARING THAT IT

01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:48.114
IS IS IS THE PERKINS ELMER LAB

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:49.649
ARE THEY GOING TO PRIORITIZE

01:59:49.715 --> 01:59:51.551
SCOOTERS IN THE CITY STAFF OR

01:59:51.617 --> 01:59:54.120
RESIDENTS OR BOTH YES WE'RE

01:59:54.186 --> 01:59:55.221
GONNA BE PRIORITIZING ALL

01:59:55.288 --> 01:59:57.356
CONGREGATE SETTINGS OF BOTH

01:59:57.423 --> 01:59:58.925
ONES UNDER AB DEPARTMENT SOCIAL

01:59:58.991 --> 01:59:59.959
SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:01.627
PUBLIC HEALTH PERFECT THANK

02:00:01.694 --> 02:00:03.429
YOU AND MAYBE THIS IS MAYBE

02:00:03.496 --> 02:00:04.730
FOR CRACK BUT MISSED A MISSED

02:00:04.797 --> 02:00:05.898
AND -- YOU CAN JUMP INTO AYE

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:06.832
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:08.301
IS LIKE A FIVE STAR QUALITY

02:00:08.367 --> 02:00:11.337
RATING SYSTEM -- FOR NURSING

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:14.407
FACILITIES -- YES IS THERE A

02:00:14.473 --> 02:00:17.410
WAY -- UPDATED -- OR MODERNIZE

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:18.911
IT TO MAKE INFORMATION MORE

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:20.446
READILY AVAILABLE CRAIG YOU'D

02:00:20.513 --> 02:00:21.847
MENTIONED THAT YOU WOULD LIKE

02:00:21.914 --> 02:00:23.716
KIND OF A ONE PORTAL SYSTEM FOR

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:25.351
EVERYONE TO HAVE INFORMATION IS

02:00:25.418 --> 02:00:27.787
THAT PART OF THAT DISCUSSION OR

02:00:27.853 --> 02:00:29.722
-- HOW WOULD YOU KIND OF BLEND

02:00:29.789 --> 02:00:32.358
THAT YOU ARE MAYBE ADDRESS THAT

02:00:32.425 --> 02:00:34.860
THAT TRANSPARENCY YEAH THE FIVE

02:00:34.927 --> 02:00:36.329
STAR THE FIVE STAR REALLY LOOKS

02:00:36.395 --> 02:00:37.730
A QUALITY THAT'S REALLY WHAT

02:00:37.797 --> 02:00:39.131
IT'S IT'S FOCUSED ON AND ALL

02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:40.733
THE METRICS RELATED QUALITY I

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.001
THINK WHAT I WAS REALLY TALKING

02:00:42.068 --> 02:00:44.403
ABOUT WAS ONE PLACE FOR -- THAT

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:45.538
EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND ALL

02:00:45.605 --> 02:00:47.206
THE DIFFERENT GUIDES BECAUSE

02:00:47.273 --> 02:00:48.307
WE GET WE HAVE SOMETIMES WE

02:00:48.374 --> 02:00:49.809
HAVE FEDERAL GUIDANCE FOR

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:51.410
EXAMPLE IN VISITATION WE HAVE

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:53.179
FEDERAL GUIDANCE ON VISITATION

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:54.614
STATE GUIDELINE VISITATION

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:56.449
STATUS TRIED TO MARRY THAT UP

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:57.683
BUT AS YOU HEARD THE COLON'S

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:59.218
MOTHER SAY THE COUNTIES THAT

02:00:59.285 --> 02:00:59.952
WOULD THEN HAVE THEIR OWN

02:01:00.019 --> 02:01:01.554
SET OF GUIDANCE SO THERE

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:02.888
THERE'S NO IT'S THERE'S NOT

02:01:02.955 --> 02:01:04.056
IT'S NOT THERE'S NO WILL ONE

02:01:04.123 --> 02:01:05.257
STOP SHOPPING AND THAT'S JUST

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:07.093
ONE EXAMPLE OF THEIR OTHER

02:01:07.159 --> 02:01:08.761
REQUIREMENTS TO WEAR THAT SOME

02:01:08.828 --> 02:01:10.896
COUNTIES -- WILL PLACE -- AND

02:01:10.963 --> 02:01:13.199
IT MISSION TO BAN ON FACILITIES

02:01:13.265 --> 02:01:14.667
-- FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:15.968
AND THEN THE STATE OF THE STATE

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:17.203
GUIDES MIGHT BE DIFFERENT ON

02:01:17.269 --> 02:01:18.504
THAT SO I THINK LIKE I SAID

02:01:18.571 --> 02:01:19.605
FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:21.540
IN ONE PLACE ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:01:21.607 --> 02:01:23.109
GUIDANCE AND REQUIREMENTS

02:01:23.309 --> 02:01:24.110
WHETHER THEY'RE FEDERAL

02:01:24.176 --> 02:01:25.978
STATE OR LOCAL AT THE FIVE

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:27.546
STAR IS REALLY MORE OF MORE

02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:29.415
FOR THE CONSUMER -- TO FIND

02:01:29.482 --> 02:01:31.017
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ABOUT

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:32.918
THE AT THE QUALITY OF THE OF

02:01:32.985 --> 02:01:35.721
THE FACILITIES MS AKERS AT WILL

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:36.689
AS A WAY TO KIND OF BLEND IT

02:01:36.756 --> 02:01:38.124
ALL WHEN YOU GOT THE ONE CITY

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:39.358
GET THE PORTAL RIGHT NOW THE

02:01:39.425 --> 02:01:40.860
DASHBOARD THAT HAS THAT WOULD

02:01:40.926 --> 02:01:42.094
IT BE ABLE TO WOULD YOU BE ABLE

02:01:42.161 --> 02:01:44.597
TO ADD EVERYTHING THAT WAS I

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:45.531
MEAN ALL THIS INFORMATION TO

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:47.199
ONE OR IS THAT IT IS A BETTER

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:49.035
TO KEEP IT SEPARATE I GUESS

02:01:49.101 --> 02:01:51.504
I'M NO SO WE HAVE -- AS FAR AS

02:01:51.570 --> 02:01:52.938
ALL OF OUR DATA AND INFORMATION

02:01:53.005 --> 02:01:54.507
THAT'S ON A ONE STOP PORTAL BUT

02:01:54.573 --> 02:01:56.842
AND WHAT CRAIG'S ALLUDING TO IS

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:59.045
WE HAVE OUR ALL OF OUR STATES

02:01:59.111 --> 02:02:00.279
GUIDANCE ARE ALL FACILITY

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:02.748
LETTERS FROM DPH THOSE ARE ALL

02:02:02.815 --> 02:02:04.383
ON OUR WEBSITE WE CAN ALSO PUT

02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:07.053
ALL OF OUR FEDERAL FROM CMS --

02:02:07.119 --> 02:02:09.522
ON THERE AS WELL THE TRICK IS

02:02:09.588 --> 02:02:12.792
ON HAVING EVERY -- COUNTY AND

02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:14.894
EVERY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:16.495

HEALTH ORDERS TO OUR WEBSITE

02:02:18.898 --> 02:02:19.799
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:21.367
OBVIOUSLY EVERY COUNTY CAN

02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:23.169
HAVE YOU KNOW THEIR OWN HEALTH

02:02:23.235 --> 02:02:26.372
ORDER -- AROUND COVE IT IN SO

02:02:26.439 --> 02:02:27.840
IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF TRYING

02:02:27.907 --> 02:02:29.809
TO -- ASK THAT ALL OF OUR

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.477
INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES WOULD THEN

02:02:31.544 --> 02:02:33.879
HAVE TO AGREE TO -- POSTING IT

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:35.381
ON A STATE WEBSITE WERE LINKING

02:02:35.448 --> 02:02:37.316
IT OR WE CAN MAYBE EVEN LINK

02:02:37.383 --> 02:02:38.651
TO ALL OF THE COUNTIES BUT

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:39.618
THAT SOMEONE WOULD STILL HAVE

02:02:39.685 --> 02:02:41.387
TO GO THROUGH OUR WEBSITE TO

02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:42.488
THEN LOOK AT ALL THE COUNTIES

02:02:42.555 --> 02:02:44.557
OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND AND

02:02:44.623 --> 02:02:46.859
IN TERMS OF THAT SCENARIO --

02:02:46.926 --> 02:02:47.927
HOW DOES THAT HOW DO YOU TELL

02:02:47.993 --> 02:02:49.662
A CDPH WORK WITH THE COUNTIES

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:51.630
OF THE COUNTIES GO STRICT ARE

02:02:51.697 --> 02:02:53.365
HAVE A DIFFERENCE I WANT TO

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:54.867
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT HOW DO

02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:56.502
THEY IS THERE A COLLABORATIVE

02:02:56.569 --> 02:02:59.572
PROCESS THERE ARE ARE HOW DO

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:02.108
I KNOW YEAH I KNOW ABSOLUTELY

02:03:02.174 --> 02:03:03.509
IT'S A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS

02:03:03.576 --> 02:03:04.643
THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:05.911
YOU HAVE CALLED A PUBLIC

02:03:05.978 --> 02:03:07.780
HEALTH OFFICERS AND SHE WALKS

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:09.215
THROUGH YOU KNOW OUR WHAT OUR

02:03:09.281 --> 02:03:10.649
VISITATION GUIDANCE IS WHAT

02:03:10.716 --> 02:03:11.884
THEIR VISITATION GUIDES AS

02:03:11.951 --> 02:03:13.652
WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS YOU KNOW

02:03:13.719 --> 02:03:14.987
-- ARE THERE WAYS FOR US TO

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.689
FIND -- SOME MIDDLE GROUND OR

02:03:16.756 --> 02:03:19.291
ONLINE -- AND I NORMALLY YOU

02:03:19.358 --> 02:03:20.259
KNOW WORKED AGAIN TRYING TO

02:03:20.326 --> 02:03:21.560
TAKE IT FROM A SCIENCE APPROACH

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:23.229
OF CAKE YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:24.797
IS SIX FEET APART AND THAT

02:03:24.864 --> 02:03:26.232
WEARING A MASK AND THEY'RE IN

02:03:26.298 --> 02:03:28.100
THIS LARGE VENTILATED SPACE YOU

02:03:28.167 --> 02:03:29.835
KNOW WHAT IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS

02:03:29.902 --> 02:03:30.970
THE CONCERN BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:32.338
THAT THAT IS SAFE AS PRACTICE

02:03:32.404 --> 02:03:33.773
FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:03:33.839 --> 02:03:35.708
A VISITATION AND SO WE TRY TO

02:03:35.775 --> 02:03:38.377
WALK THROUGH WHAT THE ISSUES

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:40.479
ARE BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY

02:03:40.546 --> 02:03:41.814
YOU KNOW MULTI FACTORIAL

02:03:41.881 --> 02:03:43.382
DEPENDING ON WHAT IS GOING

02:03:43.449 --> 02:03:45.451
ON IN THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY

02:03:45.518 --> 02:03:47.086
OKAY CO DISCOURAGE COUNTIES

02:03:47.153 --> 02:03:49.922
FROM ACTING SEPARATELY OR DID

02:03:49.989 --> 02:03:52.191
YOU HAVE WELL THEY HAVE THE

02:03:52.258 --> 02:03:53.659
AUTHORITY ULTIMATE AUTHORITY

02:03:53.726 --> 02:03:54.760
TO DO THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT

02:03:54.827 --> 02:03:57.163
OUR OUR LOCAL -- PUBLIC HEALTH

02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:59.565
AND GOVERNMENT IS SET UP A WE

02:03:59.632 --> 02:04:02.034
DO HAVE DR ERICA PAN -- WHO

02:04:02.101 --> 02:04:03.702
IS ARE ACTING STATE HEALTH

02:04:03.769 --> 02:04:05.838
OFFICER OF COURSE AND THAT IS

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:07.706
HER ROLE AS WELL TO WORK WITH

02:04:07.773 --> 02:04:09.975
THE COUNTIES IN IN GIVING ON

02:04:10.042 --> 02:04:11.210
A WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:12.444
AS FAR AS DIRECTION BUT NOW

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:14.079
WE WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY AS

02:04:14.146 --> 02:04:15.748
BEST AS WE CAN TO TO GET AS

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:18.517
MUCH ALIGNMENT IS POSSIBLE CAN

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:20.519
YOU RECOMMEND THIS ITEM YEAH

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:21.720
I THINK IT JUST AND JUST ONE

02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:23.289
QUICK THING I THINK TO TO SHOW

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:24.456
YOU HOW DIFFICULT SOME OF THIS

02:04:24.523 --> 02:04:26.258
CAN BE WHAT IT COUNTY DOES

02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:27.893
ON FOR EXAMPLE I'M AWARE ONE

02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.061
COUNTY IN THE BAY AREA THIS

02:04:29.128 --> 02:04:30.362
THAT PARTICULAR ONE PARTICULAR

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:32.031
STANDARD FOR EMISSIONS FROM

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:34.133
HOSPITALS THAT HAS AN EFFECT

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.467
OBVIOUSLY AND SNIFFS IN THAT

02:04:35.534 --> 02:04:37.002
COUNTY BUT IT HAS AN EFFECT ON

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:38.304
ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTIES

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:39.371
GIVEN THAT THE BAY AREA FOR

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:40.840
EXAMPLE IS A DYNAMIC REGION

02:04:40.906 --> 02:04:42.274
WHERE PEOPLE MOVED COUNTY THE

02:04:42.341 --> 02:04:44.310
COUNTY PRETTY PRETTY -- PRETTY

02:04:44.376 --> 02:04:45.578
OFTEN SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:46.745
REASONS I THINK IT'S IT'S A

02:04:46.812 --> 02:04:48.681
CHALLENGE JUST FOR FACILITIES

02:04:48.747 --> 02:04:49.715
TO OPERATE IN THAT KIND OF

02:04:49.782 --> 02:04:51.450
ENVIRONMENT -- WHERE WHERE AND

02:04:51.517 --> 02:04:53.252
WE UNDERSTAND CLEARLY A LOCAL

02:04:53.319 --> 02:04:55.221
PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS HAVE

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:56.722
THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY HERE

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:58.557
BUT JUST JUST GETTING A HANDLE

02:04:58.624 --> 02:05:01.026
ON THE WIDE VARIETY HAS BEEN

02:05:01.093 --> 02:05:02.361
A CHALLENGE FOR OXFORD FOR

02:05:02.428 --> 02:05:04.730
FACILITIES TO OPERATE SO IT'S

02:05:04.797 --> 02:05:05.931
GREAT RECOMMENDED THE PUBLIC

OTHER OFFICERS PARKOUR NAY WITH

AND IN SOME WAYS IT MAY AND

02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:13.472
THAT MAY BE PART OF THIS WEEKLY

02:05:13.539 --> 02:05:14.640
A BEST PRACTICE OF HAVING A

02:05:14.707 --> 02:05:16.609
WEEKLY KIND OF COORDINATING

02:05:16.675 --> 02:05:18.477
-- SESSION WHERE EVERYONE CAN

02:05:18.544 --> 02:05:20.412
KIND OF SHARE INFORMATION I

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:21.513
GUESS THAT'S THE BEST PRACTICE

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:23.449
THAT'S COME OUT OF IT -- --

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:24.583
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO HAVE A

A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE

02:05:53.946 --> 02:05:57.683
FROM THE BEING VIRTUAL SO NOT

02:05:58.150 --> 02:05:59.551
I WONDER I WONDER I ACTUALLY

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:00.552
HAD A FEW THINGS I COULD

02:06:00.619 --> 02:06:03.389
COMMENT ON -- BUT I WANTED TO

02:06:03.455 --> 02:06:05.824
PREFACE IT WITH A WORD I'VE

02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:08.260
COME TO UNDERSTAND OVER THE

02:06:08.327 --> 02:06:10.029
LAST EIGHT MONTHS WHICH IS THE

02:06:10.095 --> 02:06:13.432
WORD STAKEHOLDER AND I I WANT

02:06:13.499 --> 02:06:15.901
TO COMMEND CDPH FOR ENGAGING

02:06:15.968 --> 02:06:17.636
THE GERIATRICS COUNCIL AND CAL

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:20.639
TCM WE ARE NOT STAKEHOLDERS

02:06:21.206 --> 02:06:23.676
WE ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS

02:06:23.742 --> 02:06:26.478
AND I REALLY CONTINUE TO BE

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:29.048
CHALLENGED BY A DISPUTE BYE

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:30.983
BYE HOW THE PROCESS WORKS

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:34.186
WHERE STAKEHOLDERS DO YOU

02:06:34.253 --> 02:06:35.921
HAVE THEIR INPUT AND THE

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:37.089
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ARE

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:39.692
NOT INCLUDED IN DISCUSSIONS

02:06:39.758 --> 02:06:41.126
THAT DRIVE POLICY THAT MAKE

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:41.994
DECISIONS AND I'LL GIVE YOU

02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:45.264
A FEW EXAMPLES WE DIDN'T HAVE

02:06:45.497 --> 02:06:46.932
GERIATRICIANS ARE EXPERTS IN

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:48.167
LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE ON THE

02:06:48.233 --> 02:06:50.502
TESTING TASK FORCE AND THAT

02:06:50.569 --> 02:06:52.871
LED TO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN

02:06:52.938 --> 02:06:54.840
KNOWLEDGE REGARDING RESPONSE

02:06:54.907 --> 02:06:58.811
TO TESTING I'M ALSO I DO WANT

02:06:58.877 --> 02:06:59.778
TO COMMENT ON THE OVERALL

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.246
MORTALITY AND I DO AGREE

02:07:01.313 --> 02:07:03.048
THAT THE STATE HAS DONE AN

02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:05.818
INCREDIBLE JOB OF PUTTING INTO

02:07:05.884 --> 02:07:08.754
ACTION A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:10.889
AND MITIGATION EFFORTS THAT

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:12.491
HAVE REDUCED MORTALITY BUT

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:13.359
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A COUPLE

02:07:13.425 --> 02:07:16.895
CABBIE ODDS ALMOST MANY OF

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:18.630
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:21.333
MADE BY THE EXPERTS IN MARCH

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:24.103
AND TOOK TILL JUNE JULY AUGUST

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:25.704
SEPTEMBER OCTOBER BEFORE THEY

02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:27.840
WERE IMPLEMENTED LIVES COULD

02:07:27.906 --> 02:07:31.176
HAVE BEEN SAVED AND -- I I AND

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:32.111
THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK

02:07:32.177 --> 02:07:33.545
A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T REALIZE

02:07:33.612 --> 02:07:35.481
AS A GERIATRICIAN LOOKING AT

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:36.615
THE NUMBERS FOR EIGHT MONTHS

02:07:36.682 --> 02:07:38.817
IN THE DATA ONE OF THE REASONS

02:07:38.884 --> 02:07:40.819
OVERALL MORTALITY HAS GONE DOWN

02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:42.955
IS IS BECAUSE WE'RE IMPROVING

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:45.024
IN OUR EFFORTS BUT IT'S ALSO

02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:47.960
BECAUSE THE MOST FRAIL MEMBERS

02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:49.895
OF OUR NURSING HOMES HAVE

02:07:49.962 --> 02:07:52.631
ALREADY DIED SO AND THEY'RE

02:07:52.698 --> 02:07:54.933
NOT BEING REPLACED AND SO THE

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.569
THE DATA I'M NOT SURPRISED

02:07:57.636 --> 02:07:59.304
THAT MORTALITY RATES ARE LOWER

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:00.539
NOW IN THE THE THING THAT

02:08:00.606 --> 02:08:02.708
CONCERNS ME AS WELL WE'VE MADE

02:08:02.775 --> 02:08:05.310
IMPROVEMENTS VULNERABLE OLDER

02:08:05.377 --> 02:08:08.414
ADULTS CONTINUE TO DIE EVERY

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:10.883
WEEK AND AND AND AND I JUST

02:08:10.949 --> 02:08:12.518
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:13.886
LOOK AT THEIR SAYS HEY WE'RE

02:08:13.952 --> 02:08:17.022
DOING GREAT WE ARE STILL LOSING

02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:18.190
VULNERABLE RESIDENTS WE ARE

02:08:18.257 --> 02:08:21.026
STILL LOSING FRONTLINE STAFF

02:08:21.994 --> 02:08:23.495
I I ALSO WANTED TO COMMENT

02:08:23.562 --> 02:08:26.398
ON THE VA -- I I'VE BEEN IN

02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:27.800
TOUCH WITH MY VA COLLEAGUES

02:08:27.866 --> 02:08:29.468
FROM THE BEGINNING AND THE VA

02:08:29.535 --> 02:08:31.737
IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HAVING

02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:33.705
GERIATRICIANS INVOLVED HAVING

02:08:33.772 --> 02:08:35.040
ENGAGE MEDICAL DIRECTORS

02:08:35.107 --> 02:08:37.543
INVOLVED HAVING ENOUGH STAFFING

02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:40.112
INVOLVED I DOCTOR TOM YOSHIKAWA

02:08:40.446 --> 02:08:42.081
I WAS ACTUALLY ON ONE OF OUR

02:08:42.147 --> 02:08:44.383
EXPERT GROUPS HE'S AT THE VA IN

02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:47.453
WEST LOS ANGELES -- THAT MADE

02:08:47.519 --> 02:08:49.021
RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND TESTING

02:08:49.088 --> 02:08:50.255
THAT WE PUBLISHED AT THE END

02:08:50.322 --> 02:08:51.957
OF MAY SO I THINK THE VA IS A

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:54.259
GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT WORKS AND

02:08:54.326 --> 02:08:55.961
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WE LOOK

02:08:56.028 --> 02:08:58.831
AT THAT AS AS AS A POSITIVE

02:08:58.897 --> 02:09:00.833
-- THE OTHER THING THAT WAS

02:09:00.899 --> 02:09:02.134
THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT

02:09:02.201 --> 02:09:03.769
THE VACCINE PRIORITIZATION

02:09:03.836 --> 02:09:05.237
I ACTUALLY HAD THE HONOR OF

02:09:05.304 --> 02:09:07.172
SERVING ON THE NATIONAL ACADEMY

02:09:07.239 --> 02:09:09.141
OF SCIENCE A COMMITTEE THAT

02:09:09.208 --> 02:09:10.509
MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:14.113
ALLOCATION OF VACCINE AND THERE

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:16.315
IS NO QUESTION THAT FRONTLINE

02:09:16.381 --> 02:09:18.016
NURSING HOME STAFF ARE THIS

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:19.451
ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:22.087
GROUPS TO GET VACCINATED BUT

02:09:22.154 --> 02:09:23.889
WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY CONVENE

02:09:23.956 --> 02:09:26.158
ANOTHER GROUP OF EXPERTS TO

02:09:26.225 --> 02:09:27.759
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND GIVE

02:09:27.826 --> 02:09:29.161
GUIDANCE AT THE STATE AND

02:09:29.228 --> 02:09:31.730
FEDERAL LEVEL BECAUSE WHAT

02:09:31.797 --> 02:09:33.432
YOU'VE HEARD TODAY IS THE

02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:34.766
TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF THE

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:36.401
CHALLENGES THAT ARE GOING TO

02:09:36.468 --> 02:09:38.203
OCCUR WHEN WE START TRYING

02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:40.672
TO IMPLEMENT THE VACCINE WITH

02:09:40.739 --> 02:09:43.208
THE FRONTLINE STAFF AND AGAIN

02:09:43.275 --> 02:09:44.510
THIS IS I KNOW THIS IS NOT

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:46.278
NECESSARILY A FORM FOR HEARING

02:09:46.345 --> 02:09:47.913
ALL THOSE DETAILS I AM HAPPY

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.882
TO SHARE THAT WITH YOUR STAFF

02:09:49.948 --> 02:09:52.217
-- BUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO

02:09:52.284 --> 02:09:54.486
BE EASY IN FACT THE WAY THE

02:09:54.553 --> 02:09:56.054
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SET UP

02:09:56.121 --> 02:09:58.157
THE PROCESS THEY HAVE BASICALLY

02:09:58.223 --> 02:10:00.159
GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY TO CVS AND

02:10:00.225 --> 02:10:02.127
WALGREENS TO VACCINATE NURSING

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:03.629
HOME RESIDENTS THEY'VE GIVEN

02:10:03.695 --> 02:10:05.464
EACH STATE THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:06.965
TO DECIDE HOW THE NURSING

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:09.668
HOME STAFFER VACCINATED AND

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:11.537
THAT CREATES AND I'VE ACTUALLY

02:10:11.603 --> 02:10:12.437
BEEN IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE

02:10:12.504 --> 02:10:14.406
MAJOR VACCINE MANUFACTURERS

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:15.908
THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN A LOT

02:10:15.974 --> 02:10:17.075
OF GREAT DIRECTION BY THE

02:10:17.142 --> 02:10:19.645
FEDS SO THERE'S A LOT MORE

02:10:19.711 --> 02:10:21.613
CONFUSION AROUND THIS THING

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.081
ANYONE IS TELLING YOU RIGHT

02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:24.783
NOW AND I AND I THINK THAT'S

02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:27.085
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT --

02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:29.454
SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS UP

02:10:29.521 --> 02:10:31.023
TO THIS POINT THAT I I REALLY

02:10:31.089 --> 02:10:33.425
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I I

02:10:33.492 --> 02:10:35.093
I I MADE SOME COMMENTS ON AND

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.528
I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:38.230
TO SHARE THEM I KNOW IT'S

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:39.364
A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT IN

02:10:39.431 --> 02:10:41.934
THIS SORT OF SETTING HERE

02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:45.370
THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR

02:10:45.437 --> 02:10:46.772
BACK TO MR FONG I THINK I

02:10:46.838 --> 02:10:48.540
THINK YOU'RE NOT A QUESTION

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:50.209
THANK YOU YES I I I DO DIS

02:10:50.275 --> 02:10:51.577
SHARED HIS ADDUCTOR WATCHMAN'S

02:10:51.643 --> 02:10:52.945
CONCERNED ABOUT A SENSE OF

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:55.013
URGENCY AND TRYING TO MOVE AS

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.181
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND AND

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:57.349
LEARNING A LOT IS THAT SINCE

02:10:57.416 --> 02:10:59.017
MY LAST TWO QUESTIONS THAT TO

02:10:59.084 --> 02:11:02.821
-- I MISS HOW IS -- I GUESS

02:11:02.888 --> 02:11:05.891
THE HAVE WE QUANTIFIED IT --

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:08.660
WHAT THE SHORTAGE IS -- OF OF

02:11:08.727 --> 02:11:10.128
LABOR STAFF -- C.

02:11:10.195 --> 02:11:10.729
N.

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:11.997
A.'S -- INTO AT THE STATE I

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:13.498
LIVE BEING FROM THE CENTRAL

02:11:13.565 --> 02:11:15.801
VALLEY IN A RURAL AREA -- YOU

02:11:15.867 --> 02:11:16.868
KNOW WE CERTAINLY HAVE EVEN

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:18.470
MORE -- CHALLENGES WHEN IT

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:19.671
COMES TO SHORTAGES OF NURSES

02:11:19.738 --> 02:11:21.773
SO I I'M -- IS THERE IS THAT

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:23.175
WE QUANTIFY THAT IN AND I THINK

02:11:23.242 --> 02:11:25.877
YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY

02:11:26.078 --> 02:11:27.980
-- THAT THAT THERE WAS A A

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:29.381
BACKLOG OR SOMETHING ISSUE IT

02:11:29.448 --> 02:11:31.250
TESTING -- -- ARE ARE GETTING

02:11:31.316 --> 02:11:32.551
CERTIFIED THE CERTIFIED TESTING

02:11:32.618 --> 02:11:33.418
OUT THAT NOT THE TESTING

02:11:33.485 --> 02:11:34.753
KOBE BUT THAT THE TESTING OF

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.622
ACTUALLY GETTING THESE -- CNA'S

02:11:36.688 --> 02:11:38.790
IN SAID THAT ANSIBLE WORKFORCE

02:11:38.857 --> 02:11:39.858
CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT

02:11:39.925 --> 02:11:42.160
AND WITH THAT I I APPRECIATE

02:11:42.227 --> 02:11:43.128
THE CHAIRMAN'S INDULGENCE IN

02:11:43.195 --> 02:11:45.564
PATIENTS SO I'M GONNA START

02:11:45.631 --> 02:11:46.632
WITH YOUR SECOND QUESTION

02:11:46.698 --> 02:11:47.666
FOR THE FIRST TIME ACTUALLY

02:11:47.733 --> 02:11:49.735
DEFERRED A CRAG AND HEIDI AT

02:11:49.801 --> 02:11:50.769
THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT YES

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:52.471
THEY HAVE BUT I THINK THE REAL

02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:53.839
ANSWER IS MUCH MORE NUANCED SO

02:11:53.905 --> 02:11:55.907
IN TERMS OF BACKLOG TESTING AT

02:11:55.974 --> 02:11:57.209
THE HEALTHCARE GROUP PATHWAY WE

02:11:57.276 --> 02:11:58.310
HAD STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED IN

02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:00.912
MAY TESTING CENTERS WERE CLOSED

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:02.281
WHEN THEY RE OPEN TESTING

02:12:02.347 --> 02:12:03.915
CENTERS WHICH ARE NOT SUPER

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:05.817
PLENTIFUL IN GENERAL THEY WENT

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:07.286
BACK TO THE EARLIER APPOINTMENT

02:12:07.352 --> 02:12:08.954
SO IF YOU GRADUATE IN MAY THE

02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:10.555
STUDENTS THAT WE WORK WITH JUST

02:12:10.622 --> 02:12:12.190
BEGAN TESTING LAST WEEK AND

02:12:12.257 --> 02:12:13.058
THE REMAINDER WILL TAKE THEIR

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:14.926
TEST NEXT WEEK NOW WHY THAT'S

02:12:14.993 --> 02:12:16.261
PROBLEMATIC AND WE WERE ALL

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:17.663
LEARNING A NEW NORMAL BUT IT'S

02:12:17.729 --> 02:12:19.197
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE AT THE SAME

02:12:19.264 --> 02:12:20.599
TIME WE WERE ISSUING STOPPING

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:21.800
WAIVERS TO FACILITIES AND WE

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:23.368
WERE SAYING YOU COULD HAVE

02:12:23.435 --> 02:12:24.736
A A NURSING ASSISTANT WHICH

02:12:24.803 --> 02:12:26.238
ESSENTIALLY IS THAT AS YOU

02:12:26.305 --> 02:12:27.606
NAMES HALFWAY THROUGH TRAINING

02:12:27.673 --> 02:12:29.074
COME WORK WITH YOU THEY GET

02:12:29.141 --> 02:12:31.009
PAID LESS THEY CAN'T DO THE

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:32.411
FULL SCOPE OF WORKERS THAT WERE

02:12:32.477 --> 02:12:34.212
ISSUED WAIVERS FOR THAT BUT

02:12:34.279 --> 02:12:35.781
WE DIDN'T PRIORITIZE HOW WE

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:37.382
FIND OUR WAY THROUGH THIS AND

02:12:37.449 --> 02:12:38.950
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES IT'S A

02:12:39.017 --> 02:12:40.118
WAY OF THINKING IT'S A WAY OF

02:12:40.185 --> 02:12:42.120
PROCESSING IT THAT I THINK THAT

02:12:42.187 --> 02:12:42.921
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:46.058
SYSTEM WE WE RELAX REGULATIONS

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:48.193
REALLY ARE AT A RAPID CLIP BUT

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:49.227
I THINK WE DIDN'T ALWAYS LOOK

02:12:49.294 --> 02:12:50.362
WHAT'S THE FULL AFFECTED HOW

02:12:50.429 --> 02:12:52.064
THAT PLAYS OUT I ALSO THINK

02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:53.131
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

02:12:53.198 --> 02:12:55.233
THE STATE AS AS HARDY SAID THAT

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:56.668
THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW THEY'VE

02:12:56.735 --> 02:12:57.703
IDENTIFIED FORMER C.

02:12:57.769 --> 02:12:58.303
N.

02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:59.004
AC WERE CERTIFIED WHO AREN'T

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:01.206
WORKING NOW THE REASON THAT

02:13:01.273 --> 02:13:02.808
WORKING AS A LOT IT WAS ONE

02:13:02.874 --> 02:13:03.942
OF VERY CHALLENGING WORK IN

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:05.610
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT

02:13:05.677 --> 02:13:06.978
I WOULD ALSO SAY SOMETIMES THE

02:13:07.045 --> 02:13:08.680
CULTURE AND VALUE FOR THOSE

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:10.482
FOLKS RUN THE FRONT LINE IS

02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:12.451
NOT ALWAYS WHAT IT SHOULD SO

02:13:12.517 --> 02:13:13.452
WHEN I HEAR FROM C.

02:13:13.518 --> 02:13:14.052
N.

02:13:14.119 --> 02:13:14.920
A.'S WHO WENT INTO THE FIELD

02:13:14.986 --> 02:13:16.888
AND LEFT PARTLY IT'S THAT THEY

02:13:16.955 --> 02:13:18.156
WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL IN CHANGING

02:13:18.223 --> 02:13:20.058
THE CULTURE THEY WOMEN DESIRING

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:21.093
TO BE CARE GIVERS BUT THE

02:13:21.159 --> 02:13:22.227
SYSTEM WAS SET UP WHERE THEY

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:24.529
HAD TEN ELEVEN TWELVE WE'LL

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:25.731
TO CARE FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD

02:13:25.797 --> 02:13:27.366
OF TIME AND THEY WERE ABLE TO

02:13:27.432 --> 02:13:29.067
DO FOR AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEY

02:13:29.134 --> 02:13:30.535
WOULD WANT PART OF WHAT OUR

02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:31.803
STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO MANAGE

02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:32.971
UP WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.506
WE ALL LEARN WHICH IS IT

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:35.474
WHEN THEY'RE IN A COMFORTABLE

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:36.742
SITUATION THE SUPERVISOR WHEN

02:13:36.808 --> 02:13:37.676
THEY THINK THERE'S A BETTER

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:39.211
WAY TO CARE FOR RESIDENT HOW

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:40.479
THEY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:42.247
RESPECTFULLY HOW THEY RETAIN

02:13:42.314 --> 02:13:43.849
THAT AUTHORITY AND ENGAGE IN

02:13:43.915 --> 02:13:45.951
THAT RELATIONSHIP IT'S ALSO

02:13:46.017 --> 02:13:47.085
IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND THIS IS

02:13:47.152 --> 02:13:47.919
WHAT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD

02:13:47.986 --> 02:13:49.688
REALLY BE AWARE OF IS -- AND

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:50.589
I SAY THIS A LOT YOU KNOW

02:13:50.655 --> 02:13:51.790
MY GRAMMAR WITH GRAMMARLY TO

02:13:51.857 --> 02:13:53.525
HOTEL MADE SHE DIDN'T FINISH

02:13:53.592 --> 02:13:55.193
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YOU KNOW

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:56.528
THAT THE MAIDS OF YESTER

02:13:56.595 --> 02:13:58.196
YEAR OFTEN THE CARE GIVERS UP

02:13:58.263 --> 02:13:59.664
TODAY AND WE ARE SO LUCKY TO

02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:01.867
HAVE THEM MANY OF THEM ARE AT

02:14:01.933 --> 02:14:03.301
THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO

02:14:03.368 --> 02:14:04.770
TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY TO BE

02:14:04.836 --> 02:14:06.438
ENGAGING IN THIS KIND OF WORK

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:07.739
AND THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS FEEL

02:14:07.806 --> 02:14:09.207
CARE COMFORTABLE CHALLENGING

02:14:09.274 --> 02:14:10.208
AN ASSUMPTION RIGHT BECAUSE

02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:11.109
THERE'S A POWER DIFFERENCE

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:12.644
THERE WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.079
THAT THE REASON PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:14:14.146 --> 02:14:16.148
WORKING AS CNA'S ISN'T ONLY

02:14:16.214 --> 02:14:17.482
ABOUT THE CONVERSATION BUT IT

02:14:17.549 --> 02:14:19.117
IS ABOUT THE COMPENSATION IT'S

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:20.419
ALSO ABOUT THE CULTURE THAT

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:22.320
WE VALUE FOR CARE GIVERS AND

02:14:22.387 --> 02:14:23.355

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:47.512
THIRTY THOUSAND MORE C.

WASN'T A FOR DINNER CAL THAT'S

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:42.767
ALWAYS BEEN A BIG ISSUE WITH

02:15:42.834 --> 02:15:44.870
IT BEING CUT IN ANYWHERE I

02:15:44.936 --> 02:15:46.671
MEAN IT IF YOU PAY PAYS DECENT

02:15:46.738 --> 02:15:48.573
PEOPLE COME AND THE PROBLEM

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:49.774
WITH THE RECRUITING RETENTION

THERE AND YOU KNOW I GUESS MY

02:15:55.714 --> 02:15:58.216
QUESTION TO DH CS IS -- WITH

02:15:58.283 --> 02:16:01.286
LABOR COST BEING CAPPED -- WHY

02:16:01.353 --> 02:16:02.454
DON'T WE FULLY FUND THE COST

02:16:02.521 --> 02:16:05.524
OF LABOR FOR SKILLED FOR SNIFFS

02:16:09.094 --> 02:16:11.796
BANGKOK CAPS ARE INCLUDED IT

02:16:11.863 --> 02:16:14.032
YOU FIND I'VE TO THAT NINETY

02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:15.133
THREE PERCENT UP WE NEED A

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.769
CHANGE IN THE MOST RECENT TO

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:20.739
BRING ABOUT COST CAP -- -- AND

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:22.707
THEN ADDITIONALLY WE ARE THREE

02:16:22.774 --> 02:16:24.809
THAT THROUGH THE STATUTE WE

02:16:24.876 --> 02:16:26.978
ARE LIMITED TO A PERCENTAGE

02:16:27.045 --> 02:16:29.047
-- RATE INCREASE ANNUALLY

02:16:33.618 --> 02:16:34.753
OKAY BUT IT WAS IT WAS

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:35.787
STILL ISSUE THAT THAT JUST

02:16:35.854 --> 02:16:37.355
HAPPENED RECENTLY CORRECT

02:16:38.924 --> 02:16:40.458
RECTO THAT WOULD THAT BACK

02:16:40.525 --> 02:16:41.493
BUT MY TAX MONEY THAT WAS

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:43.261
PART OF THE CHANGES THAT

02:16:43.328 --> 02:16:45.497
THAT HAPPENED DURING THAT THE

02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:47.232
LACK BUDGET CYCLE TO CHANGE

02:16:47.299 --> 02:16:49.301
HOW WE CALCULATE THOSE --

02:16:49.367 --> 02:16:50.702
THAT METHODOLOGY TO INCREASE

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:52.103
THAT TO NINETY FIVE THE

02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:54.339
NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE OKAY

02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:56.908
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER

02:16:58.877 --> 02:17:00.478

HE GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:17:01.846 --> 02:17:03.348
ASK QUESTIONS AND SINCE I WAS

02:17:06.618 --> 02:17:07.986
THE FIRST COUPLE QUESTIONS ARE

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:10.388
GOING TO BE FOR MISDIAGNOSIS

02:17:10.455 --> 02:17:13.425

BACK ON HERE I GUESS MY FIRST

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:16.661
QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:17.796
THE OFFICE OF THESE LETTERS

02:17:17.862 --> 02:17:20.432
REQUIRING THAT DEEP FULL TIME

02:17:20.498 --> 02:17:22.534
INFECTION PREVENTION IS --

02:17:23.134 --> 02:17:25.870
IS THAT HAPPENING IN EVERY --

02:17:25.937 --> 02:17:27.939
SKILLED NURSING FACILITY NOW

02:17:37.616 --> 02:17:38.116
SINCE

02:17:43.254 --> 02:17:47.225
ANYBODY OUT THERE I CAN'T SIX

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:49.060

QUESTION MARK WHAT -- SO YES WE

02:17:57.769 --> 02:17:59.838
DID RECEIVE IN JUNE ALL TWELVE

02:17:59.904 --> 02:18:00.839
HUNDRED FACILITIES TURNED IT

02:18:00.905 --> 02:18:03.241
THEIR COVERT MITIGATION PLAN --

02:18:03.308 --> 02:18:04.876
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE A FEW

02:18:04.943 --> 02:18:06.645
THAT NEEDED SOME REITERATIONS

02:18:06.711 --> 02:18:07.646
-- BEFORE THEY COULD BE

02:18:07.712 --> 02:18:09.781
OFFICIALLY APPROVED ARE THEY

02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:11.282
ALL WERE EVENTUALLY APPROVED

02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:12.517
AND THEN WE GO OUT EVERY FOUR

02:18:12.584 --> 02:18:14.919
TO SIX WEEKS TO THE END VERIFY

02:18:14.986 --> 02:18:16.254
THAT THEY ARE IN FACT TO

02:18:16.321 --> 02:18:18.156
DOING -- SO AND ONE OF THOSE

02:18:18.223 --> 02:18:19.591
PIECES OF THAT MEDICATION PLAN

02:18:19.658 --> 02:18:21.092
IS THAT FULL TIME INFECTION

02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:23.828
PREVENTION ROLE -- WE HAVE --

02:18:23.895 --> 02:18:26.631
FOUND INSTANCES AND -- ENFORCED

02:18:26.698 --> 02:18:29.067
WHERE WE DID NOT FIND -- A FULL

02:18:29.134 --> 02:18:31.169
TIME INFECTION ROLE AFFECTION

02:18:31.236 --> 02:18:33.638
PREVENTION IS ROLL ON THE EONS

02:18:33.705 --> 02:18:34.606
BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:36.641
THAT IS A KEY KEY FACTOR HERE

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:38.276
TO HAVE THAT KIND OF DEDICATED

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:40.378
ROLE NOT SOMEONE WHO IS -- I'M

02:18:40.445 --> 02:18:41.279
GOING TO BE THE DIRECTOR OF

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:42.447
NURSING AND TO THE I.

02:18:42.514 --> 02:18:43.081
T.

02:18:43.148 --> 02:18:44.916
ON THE SIDE -- OR I'M GONNA BE

02:18:44.983 --> 02:18:47.018
A FRONTLINE YOU'RE A NURSE AND

02:18:47.085 --> 02:18:48.219
THE AND I KEY ON THE SIDE BUT

02:18:48.286 --> 02:18:49.721
SOMEONE WHO IS THAT DEDICATED

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:52.590
ROLE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU

02:18:52.657 --> 02:18:55.727
I'M THE NEW SURVEY MODEL WITH

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:58.630
RESPECT TO THE STATEMENT OF

02:18:58.697 --> 02:19:00.231
DEFICIENCIES CAN YOU TELL ME

02:19:00.298 --> 02:19:02.267
WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE AND

02:19:02.333 --> 02:19:04.703
WILL THE SURVEYORS BE ISSUING

02:19:04.769 --> 02:19:07.272
CITATIONS AND FINES AS WELL

02:19:09.107 --> 02:19:10.809
SO I'M ASSUMING YOU WERE

02:19:10.875 --> 02:19:11.810
TALKING ABOUT THE QUALITY

02:19:11.876 --> 02:19:14.245
AND SAFETY SURVEY MODEL THAT

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:15.847
WILL BE IMPLEMENTING A POST

02:19:15.914 --> 02:19:18.483
PANDEMIC SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE

02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:21.052
OUR COBIT MITIGATION PLANS ON

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:22.353
THAT WE ARE GOING AND LIKE I

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.822
SAID EVERY FOUR TO SIX WEEKS

02:19:23.888 --> 02:19:25.090
AND WHAT WE STARTED TO THINK

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:26.658
UP WELL HOW COULD WE PREVENT

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:27.992
THIS FROM HAPPENING YOU KNOW

02:19:28.059 --> 02:19:29.527
AGAIN EVEN IN A POST PANDEMIC

02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:31.362
WORLD BECAUSE PRE PANDEMIC

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:33.064
WE ONLY ENTERED FACILITIES

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:35.400
-- ON THE ANNUAL BASIS AND

02:19:35.467 --> 02:19:36.835
SO WE KNOW THAT ANNUAL IS NOT

02:19:36.901 --> 02:19:38.536
ENOUGH IF WE LEARNED ANYTHING

02:19:38.603 --> 02:19:40.171
ITS FREQUENCY IN THE POWER OF

02:19:40.238 --> 02:19:41.773
PRESENCE AND BEING PHYSICALLY

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.074
PRESENT IN THESE FACILITIES

02:19:43.141 --> 02:19:44.809
MORE OFTEN WHICH GARNERS

02:19:44.876 --> 02:19:48.279
BETTER -- COMPLIANCE IN SO --

02:19:48.346 --> 02:19:49.481
THE QUALITY AND SAFETY MODEL

02:19:49.547 --> 02:19:51.049
YES THEY WOULD BE ISSUING --

02:19:51.116 --> 02:19:53.384
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ON PENALTY

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:55.920
CITATIONS ALL -- SERVING THE

02:19:55.987 --> 02:19:59.157
SAME REGULATOR -- MODEL THAT

02:19:59.224 --> 02:20:01.593
THEY -- CURRENTLY PLAY THE

02:20:01.659 --> 02:20:02.794
DIFFERENCE IS THE FREQUENCY

02:20:02.861 --> 02:20:04.763
AND KEEPING THIS LEVEL OF

02:20:04.829 --> 02:20:07.198
-- HEIGHTENS -- FREQUENCY UP

02:20:07.265 --> 02:20:09.901
POST PANDEMIC SO AS WE MOVE

02:20:09.968 --> 02:20:11.236
INTO THE NEW MODELS HERE

02:20:11.302 --> 02:20:12.937
THE THE FAMILY THE RESIDENT

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:15.140
COMPLAINTS -- ARE THEY GOING

02:20:15.206 --> 02:20:17.308
TO BE INVESTIGATED THROUGH US A

02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:19.043
NEW PROCESS AND AND WHAT'S THE

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:21.212
CURRENT BACKLOG OF CREE COVE

02:20:21.279 --> 02:20:23.748
IT INVESTIGATIONS HOW MANY HOW

02:20:23.815 --> 02:20:25.183
AND HOW LONG IS IT TAKING TO

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:27.318
-- FOR THOSE INVESTIGATIONS TO

02:20:27.385 --> 02:20:30.722
OCCUR GREAT QUESTION SO WHEN

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:31.856
I WAS APPOINTED IN DECEMBER

02:20:31.923 --> 02:20:34.225
TWENTY EIGHTEEN -- WE IN

02:20:34.292 --> 02:20:35.894
HYATT HERITAGE EIGHTY I THINK

02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:36.995
IT WAS AROUND TWENTY FIVE

02:20:37.061 --> 02:20:39.497
THOUSAND BACKLOG OF ALL NON

02:20:39.564 --> 02:20:41.499
LONG TERM CARE AND LONG TERM

02:20:41.566 --> 02:20:43.268
CARE COMBINED TO COMPLAINTS

02:20:43.334 --> 02:20:45.370
AND FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENTS

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:47.572
MOST OF THOSE OF WHICH WERE

02:20:47.639 --> 02:20:49.707
FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENTS I'M

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:51.709
NOT COMPLAINTS AND I WOULD SAY

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:53.244
IT WAS ABOUT SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY

02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:54.779
BETWEEN NON LONG TERM CARE AND

02:20:54.846 --> 02:20:57.182
LONG TERM CARE SETTINGS WE PUT

02:20:57.248 --> 02:20:58.850
TOGETHER A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

02:20:58.917 --> 02:21:00.285
OF HOW THIS BACKLOG EVEN

02:21:00.351 --> 02:21:02.520
HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA -- AND

02:21:02.587 --> 02:21:04.789
WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SEVERAL

02:21:04.856 --> 02:21:06.324
ROOT CAUSES THAT WERE THE MAIN

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:07.892
IMPETUS FOR THIS AND THEN PUT

02:21:07.959 --> 02:21:09.961
TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

02:21:10.028 --> 02:21:13.264
TO REDUCE THAT -- EONS WHEN WE

02:21:13.331 --> 02:21:16.401
WE INITIATED THAT AND THAT WHAT

02:21:16.467 --> 02:21:17.535
WE CALL THE DEBT FREE TWENTY

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:19.437
TWENTY ONE PLAN IN OCTOBER OF

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:21.372
TWENTY NINETEEN AND IN JUST A

02:21:21.439 --> 02:21:23.141
FEW SHORT MONTHS PRIOR TO THE

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:25.176
PANDEMIC KIDDING -- WE WERE UP

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:26.945
TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OVERALL

02:21:27.011 --> 02:21:28.980
TOTAL REDUCTION AND THAT'S NOT

02:21:29.047 --> 02:21:31.115
JUST OF -- ALL THE BACK LOT

02:21:31.182 --> 02:21:32.550
COMPLAINTS BUT THAT WAS ALSO

02:21:32.617 --> 02:21:34.285
INCLUDING THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE

02:21:34.352 --> 02:21:36.120
MEANING EVERYTHING COMING IN

02:21:36.187 --> 02:21:37.322
AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS BACK

02:21:37.388 --> 02:21:38.423
LOCKED BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO

02:21:38.489 --> 02:21:39.991
US ANY GOOD TO JUST WORK OFF

02:21:40.058 --> 02:21:41.259
THE BACKLOG AND THEN CONTINUE

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:42.927
TO ACCRUE WHATEVER IS COMING IN

02:21:42.994 --> 02:21:44.896
SO THAT WAS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:47.131
-- OVERALL TODAY YOU KNOW IF WE

02:21:47.198 --> 02:21:48.600
LOOK AT JUST THE BACKLOG THAT

02:21:48.666 --> 02:21:49.868
WAS IT YOU KNOW MAYBE FIFTY

02:21:49.934 --> 02:21:51.336
PERCENT ALREADY TAKING CARE

02:21:51.402 --> 02:21:53.304
OF -- BUT WHAT MATTERS TO ME

02:21:53.371 --> 02:21:54.372
IS THAT THEN WHEN WE HIT THE

02:21:54.439 --> 02:21:56.507
PANDEMIC IN MARCH AND APRIL

02:21:56.574 --> 02:21:57.709
WELL WE WERE TRYING TO GARNER

02:21:57.775 --> 02:21:59.577
ENOUGH PP FOR STAFF WHAT WE

02:21:59.644 --> 02:22:00.578
WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH

02:22:00.645 --> 02:22:02.747
NEW INFECTION CONTROL PROCESSES

02:22:02.814 --> 02:22:04.015
AS WELL AS DOING INFECTION

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:06.351
CONTROL FEDERAL SURVEYS --

02:22:06.417 --> 02:22:07.952
THEN THERE WAS A FEW WEEKS

02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:09.220
AFTER WE STOPPED AND THEN

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:10.455
WE FOCUSED OTHER ACTIVITIES

02:22:10.521 --> 02:22:11.723
SO UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR

02:22:11.789 --> 02:22:15.059
BACKLOG WORK -- HAD TO TAKE

02:22:15.126 --> 02:22:18.596
-- AND HAD TO BE PAUSED OR --

02:22:18.663 --> 02:22:20.365
AND DEDICATED DURING THE FIRST

02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:22.166
OF THOSE INITIAL MONTHS I'M

02:22:22.233 --> 02:22:24.569
AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO --

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:27.138
WE BEGAN THOSE COMPLAIN AFTER

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:31.876
RIGHT -- -- -- INVESTIGATIONS

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:33.478
WE DO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS

02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:36.447
IN TANDEM WITH OR IN PARALLEL

02:22:36.514 --> 02:22:38.783
WITH OUR -- WITH MEDICATIONS

02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:40.051
OR WE GO OUT ONTO A COVERT

02:22:40.118 --> 02:22:42.420
MITIGATION SURVEY WE ALSO TAKE

02:22:42.487 --> 02:22:43.454
ANY COMPLAINTS OR F.

02:22:43.521 --> 02:22:44.489
RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT

02:22:44.555 --> 02:22:46.524
FACILITY -- AND THEN THE PLAN

02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:50.361
IS ALSO POST PANDEMIC AS WE

02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:51.462
ARE CONTINUING THIS LEVEL

02:22:51.529 --> 02:22:53.264
OF FREQUENCY TO WORK OFF THE

02:22:53.331 --> 02:22:55.199
BACKLOG EVEN MORE QUICKLY

02:22:55.266 --> 02:22:56.634
BY BRINGING THESE COMPLAINTS

02:22:56.701 --> 02:22:58.269
EVER ARISE WITH US TO THOSE

02:22:58.336 --> 02:23:00.071
FACILITIES BECAUSE IN ORDER

02:23:00.138 --> 02:23:02.140
TO DO A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

02:23:02.206 --> 02:23:03.174
IT IS REQUIRED THAT YOU GO

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:04.475
ON SITE AND SO WE'RE TRYING

02:23:04.542 --> 02:23:06.244
TO REDUCE TRAVEL TIME WHICH

02:23:06.311 --> 02:23:07.745
WAS A BIG FACTOR IN OUR

02:23:07.812 --> 02:23:09.280
GREAT STATE THAT HAS A LOT OF

02:23:09.347 --> 02:23:11.616
GEOGRAPHICAL AND CHALLENGES

02:23:11.683 --> 02:23:12.650
WITH YOU KNOW SOME MOUNTAINS

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:13.584
THAT WE CAN'T PASS THROUGH

02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:15.153
THE WINTERTIME EXPECTORANT

02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:17.488
AND -- A LOT OF RURAL AREAS

02:23:17.555 --> 02:23:19.390
THAT ARE HARDER TO GET TO THE

02:23:19.457 --> 02:23:20.858
OTHER PIECE WITH THIS IS THAT

02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:22.860
WE ARE LOOKING TO RECRUIT

02:23:22.927 --> 02:23:24.362
NOW THAT WE HAVE SYSTEMS IN

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:26.431
PLACE TO DO OUR WORK -- AND

02:23:26.497 --> 02:23:28.399
AT THAT TELEWORKING WORLD IN

02:23:28.466 --> 02:23:29.867
MOVING THINGS FROM PAPER TO

02:23:29.934 --> 02:23:31.936
ELECTRONIC WERE ABLE TO ALSO

02:23:32.003 --> 02:23:34.172
THEN HAS A FASTER TIME TO TASK

02:23:34.238 --> 02:23:35.673
AS FAR AS GETTING INFORMATION

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:37.442
BACK TO THE FACILITY HAVING A

02:23:37.508 --> 02:23:38.943
FACILITY ENTER INTO A PORTAL

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:40.378
SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN ACCESS

02:23:40.445 --> 02:23:42.313
THEIR FINDINGS AND BE ABLE TO

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:43.781
ISSUE THEIR PLANS OF CORRECTION

02:23:43.848 --> 02:23:45.750
ELECTRONICALLY PRIOR TO THE

02:23:45.817 --> 02:23:47.352
PANDEMIC ALL OF THIS WAS DONE

02:23:47.418 --> 02:23:50.388
BY SNAIL MAIL AND FAX EVEN IN

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:51.622
TWENTY TWENTY AND SO THIS IS

02:23:51.689 --> 02:23:53.891
A BIG HUGE SHIFT AND LEFT THAT

02:23:53.958 --> 02:23:55.760
WE ARE MAKING A MOVIE IN OUR

02:23:55.827 --> 02:23:57.795
SURVEY PROCESSES ONE SURVEY

02:23:57.862 --> 02:23:59.497
IT ONE TYPE OF SURVEY IT AT

02:23:59.564 --> 02:24:01.733
A TIME -- ONTO AN ELECTRONIC

02:24:01.799 --> 02:24:03.101
PROCESS SO THAT IS THE OTHER

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:04.736
PIECE OF THIS IS THAT THIS

02:24:04.802 --> 02:24:06.237
FALL WE ARE NOW WORKING TO

02:24:06.304 --> 02:24:07.405
MOVE OUR COMPLAINT AND AFTER

02:24:07.472 --> 02:24:09.140
I INVESTIGATION PROCESS INTO

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:11.075
AN ELECTRONIC FORMAT SO THAT

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:12.110
WE CAN BOTH WORK OFF THE

02:24:12.176 --> 02:24:13.878
BACKLOG BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:15.413
-- BE ABLE TO DO OUR WORK MORE

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:16.981
EFFICIENTLY AND BE ABLE TO

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:18.316
-- DELIVER THOSE FINDINGS IN

02:24:18.383 --> 02:24:19.751
A MORE TIMELY MANNER TO THE

02:24:19.817 --> 02:24:23.388
FACILITIES THANK YOU -- NEXT

02:24:23.454 --> 02:24:24.389
I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:27.325
FOR MISTER CORNET FEASA PUT

02:24:27.392 --> 02:24:30.261
AROUND IN THERE THANK YOU

YES SIR YEAH -- COUPLE COUPLE

02:24:35.967 --> 02:24:38.069
OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU SO WE

02:24:38.136 --> 02:24:40.471
TALKED ABOUT -- THE NEED FOR

02:24:40.538 --> 02:24:42.373
MORE MONEY FOR WORK FORCE

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:45.977
-- AND -- THE AND WE'VE GOT

02:24:46.044 --> 02:24:47.478
OBVIOUSLY CHALLENGES WITH OUR

02:24:47.545 --> 02:24:49.380
MEDICARE RATES AND AND AND SO

02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:53.651
ON SO -- NOTE NONPROFIT RUN

02:24:53.718 --> 02:24:55.653
FACILITIES VERSUS FOR PROFIT

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:58.222
RUN FACILITIES THEY'RE ALL IN

02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:00.958
REIMBURSE THE SAME RATES OR ARE

02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:03.628
THEY NOT OR ARE THEY NOT THEY

02:25:03.694 --> 02:25:05.396
THERE NOPE NO ONE'S THE INVERSE

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:06.898
THE SAME RATES EVER GET TO FILL

02:25:06.964 --> 02:25:09.667
FACILITY SPECIFIC RATE BUT IS

02:25:09.734 --> 02:25:11.803
ALSO CONSTRAINED I WOULD ALSO

02:25:11.869 --> 02:25:13.938
SAY TO THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT

02:25:14.005 --> 02:25:16.741
PATIENT MIXES IN IN -- FOR

02:25:16.808 --> 02:25:19.310
EXAMPLE -- NONPROFIT FACILITIES

02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:21.979
OVERALL I HAVE ABOUT HALF

02:25:22.046 --> 02:25:24.382
THE LEVEL OF OF OF MEDICARE

02:25:24.449 --> 02:25:25.650
PATIENTS THAT FOR PROFIT

02:25:25.716 --> 02:25:27.752
FACILITIES DO SO MEDICARE

02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:29.720
OFFICER -- FOR PROFITS AT LEAST

02:25:29.787 --> 02:25:31.222
TEN DEAD HAVE MUCH MUCH HIGHER

02:25:31.289 --> 02:25:33.191
MEDICARE HELP A PATIENT -- --

02:25:33.257 --> 02:25:36.861
POPULATIONS OKAY -- IS THAT

02:25:36.928 --> 02:25:38.463
PART OF IT IT'S HARD TO IT'S A

02:25:38.529 --> 02:25:39.897
LITTLE HARD TO TO DO A DIRECT

02:25:39.964 --> 02:25:41.532
COMPARISON THAT BUT EACH WEEK

02:25:41.599 --> 02:25:43.067
WE HAVE FACILITY SPECIFIC RATES

02:25:43.134 --> 02:25:44.168
BUT I WOULD SAY TO YOU THOUGH

02:25:44.235 --> 02:25:46.304
IS IS AND YOU HEARD LINDY'S --

02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:48.072
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER THE WAY

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:49.407
THE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:52.043
WORKS IS DE KOSTER CONSTRAINED

02:25:52.110 --> 02:25:54.178
SO EVEN THOUGH -- THOUGH THAT

02:25:54.245 --> 02:25:55.646
THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN IN THE

02:25:55.713 --> 02:25:57.515
-- THE RATES THIS LAST YEAR IF

02:25:57.582 --> 02:25:58.583
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE INCREASE

02:25:58.649 --> 02:26:00.885
WAS IT IS STILL FACILITIES

02:26:00.952 --> 02:26:03.020
ACROSS THE BOARD ARE STILL PAID

02:26:03.087 --> 02:26:04.889
SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN WHAT

02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:06.324
THE FULL COST ARE THAT THEY

02:26:06.390 --> 02:26:08.626
REPORT -- BY BEING ABLE TO DO

02:26:08.693 --> 02:26:10.027
A DIRECT PASSED THROUGH FOR

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:12.029
LABOR COST FOR EXAMPLE IF THE

02:26:12.096 --> 02:26:13.331
STATE COULD COMPENSATE FOR THE

02:26:13.397 --> 02:26:15.466
FULL FULL COST OF LABOR THAT

02:26:15.533 --> 02:26:16.501
WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN

02:26:16.567 --> 02:26:18.536
ANY KIND OF FACILITY SO THE TEN

02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:20.571
PERCENT BUMP DIDN'T GO TO LABOR

02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:23.141
THAN TWO THOUSAND TEN PERCENT

02:26:23.207 --> 02:26:24.976
TO TEN PERCENT KOBE BOB IT WENT

02:26:25.042 --> 02:26:26.611
TO IT IT HAS TO BE USED FOR

02:26:26.677 --> 02:26:28.646
ANYTHING RELATED TO CO THAT IT

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:30.882
IS GOING FOR STAFF BONUSES AND

02:26:30.948 --> 02:26:33.117
STAFF -- STAFF INCENTIVE PAY

02:26:33.184 --> 02:26:35.153
IS BEING USED FOR OVERTIME IT'S

02:26:35.219 --> 02:26:36.888
BEING USED FOR THE ADDITIONAL

02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:40.224
COST OF PP FOR TECHNOLOGY ALL

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:42.827
THE THE THE STATUTE REQUIRES --

02:26:42.894 --> 02:26:44.128
EIGHTY EIGHTY ONE REQUIRES THAT

02:26:44.195 --> 02:26:45.429
THAT TEN PERCENT BUT HAS TO BE

02:26:45.496 --> 02:26:47.165
USED FOR COPD RELATED EXPENSES

02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:49.367
MANY AND MOST OF THOSE EXPENSES

02:26:49.433 --> 02:26:50.601
I SUSPECT ARE ALL GOING TO

02:26:50.668 --> 02:26:52.403
MOSTLY BE IN THAT IN THE AREA

02:26:52.470 --> 02:26:54.071
OF STAFFING BECAUSE THE STAFF

02:26:54.138 --> 02:26:55.840
ACOSTA BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

02:26:55.907 --> 02:26:57.909
-- HIGHER WITH PEOPLE OUT ON

02:26:57.975 --> 02:26:59.243
SICK LEAVE FOR EXAMPLE ARE

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:01.879
QUARANTINING -- -- FACILITIES

02:27:01.946 --> 02:27:02.980
ARE MAKING USE OF THE NURSE

02:27:03.047 --> 02:27:04.415
REGISTRIES THOSE RATES ARE

02:27:04.482 --> 02:27:06.250
ABOUT TWICE -- ARE SOMETIMES

02:27:06.317 --> 02:27:07.852
THREE TIMES MORE THEY'RE HAVING

02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:09.353
TO PAY A LOT MORE OVER TIME AND

02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:10.721
THEY'RE PAYING BONUSES AT --

02:27:10.788 --> 02:27:13.457
STAFF INCENTIVE -- -- PAY TO

02:27:13.524 --> 02:27:17.595
-- KEEP -- STAFF ON THE JOB SO

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:19.130
BUT HE WITHOUT THEIR THEIR LOW

02:27:19.197 --> 02:27:21.632
WAGES SO I MEAN COMPARED TO THE

02:27:21.699 --> 02:27:24.468
WORK YOU KNOW THE IT'S I THINK

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:26.337
CERTAINLY PEOPLE ON THIS PANEL

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:27.438
BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THEY

02:27:27.505 --> 02:27:28.606
SHOULD BE HARPER THERE SHOULD

02:27:28.673 --> 02:27:30.441
BE HIGHER COMPENSATION SO

02:27:30.508 --> 02:27:32.009
YOU'RE PROBABLY BE A FOR PROFIT

02:27:32.076 --> 02:27:33.678
ENTITIES ARE STILL MAKING A

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:36.347
PROFIT WELL THE IF YOU LOOK

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:37.915
AT THE DATA THOUGH -- MISTER

02:27:37.982 --> 02:27:38.883
WOULD WE CAN PROVIDE SOME

02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:40.651
OF THE STATE THE PRODUCT THE

02:27:40.718 --> 02:27:42.153
PROFIT MARGINS ARE EXTREMELY

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:44.121
LOW IN THE ROUND THE ONE THAT

02:27:44.188 --> 02:27:45.022
NOT EVEN THE I WOULDN'T CALL

02:27:45.089 --> 02:27:46.190
THE PROFIT MARGINS BUT IF YOU

02:27:46.257 --> 02:27:48.259
LOOK AT THE US BY DATA ON THIS

02:27:48.326 --> 02:27:49.594
THERE IN SOMEWHERE AROUND THE

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:50.928
ONE PERCENT RANGE AND I WOULD

02:27:50.995 --> 02:27:52.530
TELL YOU THE BEST INDICATOR

02:27:52.597 --> 02:27:55.233
OF THIS IS HOW FEW NEW ENTRIES

02:27:55.299 --> 02:27:57.001
THERE ARE TO THE MARKET I

02:27:57.068 --> 02:27:58.869
MEAN THERE ARE ALMOST NO NEW

02:27:58.936 --> 02:28:00.238
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN

02:28:00.304 --> 02:28:01.739
CALIFORNIA EACH YOU CAN COUNT

02:28:01.806 --> 02:28:03.674
THEM ON ONE HAND -- AND I THINK

02:28:03.741 --> 02:28:04.976
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR

02:28:05.042 --> 02:28:06.477
THAT THAT YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:07.812
THAT A BUSINESS WHERE THERE

02:28:07.878 --> 02:28:09.480
WAS A LOT OF -- A MONEY TO BE

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:10.715
MADE YOU SEE A LOT MORE PEOPLE

02:28:10.781 --> 02:28:11.549
TO MANAGE TO GET INTO THE

02:28:11.616 --> 02:28:12.750
BUSINESSES AND THAT'S JUST NOT

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:14.719
THE CASE WELL BUT WE ALSO KNOW

02:28:14.785 --> 02:28:16.354
THERE RELATED PARTIES INVOLVED

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:18.089
THAT THAT ARE PART OF THE

02:28:18.155 --> 02:28:20.992
TANGLED WEB OF THE WAY NURSING

02:28:21.058 --> 02:28:23.894
HOME OPERATORS OPERATE SO IT'S

02:28:23.961 --> 02:28:26.230
NOT UNUSUAL FOR MY RECOLLECTION

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:28.065
THAT THAT AN OPERATOR MIGHT

02:28:28.132 --> 02:28:29.200
HAVE ITS OWN LAUNDRY SERVICE

02:28:29.267 --> 02:28:30.601
AT THE CONTRACT THEY MIGHT

02:28:30.668 --> 02:28:31.669
HAVE ANOTHER CORRECTLY THAT

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:33.337
THE BRAND FROM THE SO THERE'S

02:28:33.404 --> 02:28:35.072
SO THAT ONE PERCENT DOES IT

02:28:35.139 --> 02:28:36.807
REFLECT THE PROFIT OF THE

02:28:36.874 --> 02:28:38.643
ENTIRE INDUSTRY BUT THEY'RE NOT

02:28:38.709 --> 02:28:40.044
ALLOWED TO MAKE A PROFIT OFF

02:28:40.111 --> 02:28:41.679
OF THE RELATED PARTIES THAT'S

02:28:41.746 --> 02:28:43.080
THAT'S THAT'S NOT THERE THEY'RE

02:28:43.147 --> 02:28:44.248
NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT AND IF

02:28:44.315 --> 02:28:46.050
YOU RECALL THE AUDIT THAT THE

02:28:46.117 --> 02:28:47.918
STATE AUDITOR DID LOOK AT THAT

02:28:47.985 --> 02:28:50.087
ISSUE TOO AND FOUND NO ISSUES

02:28:50.154 --> 02:28:52.556
RELATED TO TO RELATED PARTIES

02:28:52.623 --> 02:28:55.026
I TWO YEARS AGO SO OKAY YOU'RE

02:28:55.092 --> 02:28:56.027
CORRECT THAT THERE ARE RELATED

02:28:56.093 --> 02:28:57.128
PARTIES BUT AGAIN I JUST TO

02:28:57.194 --> 02:28:58.596
SAY THAT THEIR DAY THEY'RE NOT

02:28:58.663 --> 02:28:59.630
ALLOWED TO MAKE A PROFIT OFF

02:28:59.697 --> 02:29:00.898
THAT AND WE WE'RE NOT AWARE

02:29:00.965 --> 02:29:02.600
OF ANY AGAIN WITH GIVEN THE

02:29:02.667 --> 02:29:03.668
AUDITOR'S REPORT WHEN I WEAR

02:29:03.734 --> 02:29:06.137
THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE SO -- JUST

02:29:06.203 --> 02:29:07.104
AND THIS WOULD BE A RADICAL

02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:08.272
QUESTIONS YOU PROBABLY CAN'T

02:29:08.339 --> 02:29:09.907
ANSWER BUT -- I'M GONNA PUT IT

02:29:09.974 --> 02:29:11.876
OUT THERE ANYWAY -- IF THERE

02:29:11.942 --> 02:29:13.577
WERE INCREASED AN INCREASE IN

02:29:13.644 --> 02:29:15.680
THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE

02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:17.281
-- DO YOU THINK THE INDUSTRY

02:29:17.348 --> 02:29:19.150
WOULD ALLOW FOR THE INCREASE

02:29:19.216 --> 02:29:21.452
TO GUARANTEE THAT THAT THAT GO

02:29:21.519 --> 02:29:24.021
TO INCREASE WAGES FOR WORKERS

02:29:24.322 --> 02:29:25.823
I THINK THAT THE INDUSTRY WITH

02:29:25.890 --> 02:29:27.091
VERY LAST PROFESSION WOULD

02:29:27.158 --> 02:29:28.859
VERY MUCH LIKE TO PAY WORKERS

02:29:28.926 --> 02:29:29.660
MORE I DON'T THINK THERE'S

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:31.195
ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT WHAT

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:33.397
I SUGGESTED TO YOU IS A DIRECT

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:36.200
PASS THROUGH SO IF THE THAT THE

02:29:36.267 --> 02:29:37.668
STATE WOULD FULLY COMPENSATE

02:29:37.735 --> 02:29:39.670
WHATEVER THE THE COST ARE

02:29:39.737 --> 02:29:42.039
OF OF OF STAFF RIGHT NOW THE

02:29:42.106 --> 02:29:43.774
FACILITIES ARE INCENTIVIZED TO

02:29:43.841 --> 02:29:45.810
PUT MONEY INTO STAFF THAT THAT

02:29:45.876 --> 02:29:46.911
THAT THAT'S THEIR INCENTIVE

02:29:46.977 --> 02:29:49.480
NOW BECAUSE THEY THE THE IF

02:29:49.547 --> 02:29:50.815
IT THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

02:29:50.881 --> 02:29:52.483
THEY'RE ONLY REIMBURSED -- AT

02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:54.185
THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE FOR

02:29:54.251 --> 02:29:56.020
THE LABOR COSTS REIMBURSED AT

02:29:56.087 --> 02:29:57.421
THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE BUT

02:29:57.488 --> 02:29:59.056
JUST BECAUSE THEY EVEN IF YOU

02:29:59.123 --> 02:30:00.791
GET TO THE HUNDRED A HUNDRED

02:30:00.858 --> 02:30:02.026
PERCENT HUNDRED PERCENT I

02:30:02.093 --> 02:30:03.561
DIDN'T GET TO A HUNDRED PERCENT

02:30:03.627 --> 02:30:06.130
WITHOUT A HIGHER OVERALL RATE

02:30:06.664 --> 02:30:07.765
THAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM ANY MORE

02:30:07.832 --> 02:30:10.768
MONEY -- SO BECAUSE THE RATES

02:30:10.835 --> 02:30:12.636
RIGHT NOW ARE STILL VERY VERY

02:30:12.703 --> 02:30:14.372
LOW THEY CAN THEY CAN USE MORE

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:16.307
OF THE RATE INCREASE THEY HAVE

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:18.609
FOR STAFFING THEY COULD DO THAT

02:30:18.676 --> 02:30:20.311
-- CURRENTLY BUT THEY DON'T

02:30:20.378 --> 02:30:22.012
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY OVERALL IF

02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:23.681
THE STATE SIMPLY COMPENSATED

02:30:23.748 --> 02:30:24.715
WITH A DIRECT PASSED THROUGH

02:30:24.782 --> 02:30:26.217
FOR LABOR THAT WOULD MAKE ALL

02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:28.786
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD

02:30:28.853 --> 02:30:31.422
THANK YOU BRIGITTE -- DR

02:30:31.489 --> 02:30:32.623

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:34.692
LAST SERIES OF QUESTIONS SO

02:30:34.759 --> 02:30:37.328
ARE COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU

02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:41.532
-- DR WASSERMAN -- THERE --

02:30:41.599 --> 02:30:43.434
FIRST OF ALL -- CAN YOU TALK

ABOUT SNIFFS AND AND THIRD THE

02:30:45.136 --> 02:30:46.470
THIRD IN OF THE THIRD PARTY

02:30:46.537 --> 02:30:49.039
ISSUE -- KIND OF THE NEED FOR

02:30:49.106 --> 02:30:50.374
TRANSPARENCY I KNOW ABOUT THE

02:30:50.441 --> 02:30:51.675
AUDIT I'M THE ONE WHO INITIATED

02:30:51.742 --> 02:30:54.245
THE AUDIT SO -- BUT BUT I'M

02:30:54.311 --> 02:30:55.980
CURIOUS AS HOW THIS RELATES TO

02:30:56.046 --> 02:30:57.882
THE CARES ACT AND HOW THE MONEY

02:30:57.948 --> 02:30:59.250
FROM CARE SECTOR'S BEEN DISTANT

02:30:59.316 --> 02:31:00.951
DISSEMINATED IN UTILIZED BY

02:31:01.018 --> 02:31:02.520
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:07.525
YEAH THANK YOU -- CINNAMON --

PRESHEAF THE QUESTION I'M SO I

02:31:12.062 --> 02:31:14.031
THINK THE CONCERN THAT SOME OF

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:17.168
US HAVE HAD IS HOW THE MONEY

02:31:17.234 --> 02:31:19.570
FROM THE CARES ACT IS ACTUALLY

02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:23.174
FOR -- FLOWED TO FACILITIES

02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:25.810
AND WHETHER THAT MONEY IS

02:31:26.477 --> 02:31:28.245
BEING SPENT A HUNDRED PERCENT

02:31:28.312 --> 02:31:29.914
TOWARDS DIRECT PATIENT CARE

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:31.415
WITH WHETHER IT BE HAZARD PAY

02:31:31.482 --> 02:31:33.150
WHETHER IT BE PP WHETHER IT BE

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:36.086
TESTING AND I THINK ONE OF THE

02:31:36.153 --> 02:31:37.822
CHALLENGES IS THERE'S MULTIPLE

02:31:37.888 --> 02:31:41.959
WAYS THAT MONEY CAN FOR LACK

02:31:42.026 --> 02:31:44.462

02:31:51.402 --> 02:31:52.970
THE COST REPORT DOESN'T CAPTURE

ALL RELATED PARTIES NUMBER

02:31:55.105 --> 02:31:57.675

02:31:57.741 --> 02:31:59.477

02:31:59.543 --> 02:32:02.947
WE NEED FULL TRANSPARENCY ON

02:32:03.147 --> 02:32:04.748
ALL OF THE RELATED PARTIES

02:32:04.815 --> 02:32:06.417
SIMILARLY WE NEED TO GET

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:08.352
INTO A LEVEL OF DETAIL FOR

02:32:08.419 --> 02:32:10.421
EXAMPLE WATER FACILITIES

02:32:10.488 --> 02:32:13.290

02:32:15.626 --> 02:32:16.160
P.

02:32:16.727 --> 02:32:17.828
ARE THEY PAYING MARKET RATES

02:32:17.895 --> 02:32:19.463
ARE THEY PAYING OVER MARKET

02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:21.499
RATES THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS

02:32:21.565 --> 02:32:24.201
THAT THE THE THE THE SYSTEM THE

02:32:24.268 --> 02:32:26.837
MONEY CAN BE MANIPULATED AND

02:32:26.904 --> 02:32:28.572
ALL THE SAME TIME IF IF SOME OF

02:32:28.639 --> 02:32:30.508
THAT MONEY IS GOING AWAY FROM

02:32:30.574 --> 02:32:32.409
THE FACILITY IT'S NOT BEING

02:32:32.476 --> 02:32:35.312
USED TO PAY OUR FRONTLINE STAFF

02:32:35.379 --> 02:32:36.881
FOR PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK

02:32:36.947 --> 02:32:38.549
AND AND I THINK THAT'S OF GREAT

02:32:38.616 --> 02:32:40.885
CONCERN I THINK THERE THE REAL

02:32:40.951 --> 02:32:43.988
QUESTION HERE IS WE NEED A FULL

02:32:44.054 --> 02:32:46.223

THINGS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

02:32:51.962 --> 02:32:54.098
COMMENTS -- AND RECOMMENDATION

02:32:54.164 --> 02:32:55.799
PARTICULAR ONE WAS TWENTY

02:32:55.866 --> 02:32:58.068

ARE IN ON DUTY -- I WAS KIND

02:33:01.305 --> 02:33:03.340
OF APPALLED TO REALISE AND

02:33:03.407 --> 02:33:05.776
KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:08.812
FACILITY DOES NOT REQUIRE A

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:11.649
TWENTY FOUR HOUR NURSE AND

02:33:11.715 --> 02:33:13.250
ARE IN A STE AND OUR AND WE'RE

02:33:13.317 --> 02:33:14.752
TALKING ABOUT A MEDICAL DOCTOR

02:33:14.818 --> 02:33:15.719
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT NURSE

02:33:15.786 --> 02:33:16.954
PRACTITIONERS WE'RE TALKING

02:33:17.021 --> 02:33:18.756
ABOUT AND ARE IN SO I'M GOING

02:33:18.822 --> 02:33:21.091
TO GUESS THAT SOME POINT

02:33:21.158 --> 02:33:22.226
AS THINGS WIND DOWN IN THE

02:33:22.293 --> 02:33:24.061
EVENING IT'S IT'S L.

02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:24.228
B.

02:33:24.295 --> 02:33:24.528
N.

02:33:24.595 --> 02:33:24.728
C.

02:33:24.795 --> 02:33:25.362
N.

02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:27.865
A.'S AND AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M

02:33:27.932 --> 02:33:29.700
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I I

02:33:29.767 --> 02:33:33.203
I I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MOST

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:34.905
CONSUMERS ARE AWARE OF IT WE

02:33:34.972 --> 02:33:36.373
CERTAINLY WEREN'T AWARE OF IT

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.542
AND YOU KNOW I I JUST CAN'T

02:33:38.609 --> 02:33:40.811
HELP BUT THINK THAT A CHANGE

02:33:40.878 --> 02:33:42.313
IN THAT DIRECTION WOULD BE A

02:33:42.379 --> 02:33:43.914
DRAMATIC POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:45.783
IN THE QUALITY OF CARE AND THE

02:33:45.849 --> 02:33:46.917
QUALITY OF THE HEALTH OF THE

02:33:46.984 --> 02:33:48.686
RESIDENTS SO THAT SOMETHING

02:33:48.752 --> 02:33:52.256
EARLY CAN BE CAUGHT -- AND AND

02:33:52.323 --> 02:33:53.290
YOU KNOW THINGS HAPPEN IN THE

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:54.091
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT YOU KNOW

02:33:54.158 --> 02:33:55.159
I MEAN THAT THAT THEY THEY

02:33:55.225 --> 02:33:57.027
CLEARLY DO AND AND HOSPITALS

02:33:57.094 --> 02:33:59.496
AND WHEREVER I'M JUST SHOCKED

02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:01.765
QUITE FRANKLY THAT THERE ISN'T

02:34:01.832 --> 02:34:04.335
A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A NURSE

02:34:04.401 --> 02:34:06.604
AT OUR END IN THE BUILDING

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.105
TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AT A

02:34:08.172 --> 02:34:13.777
MINIMUM -- SO I'D SO YEAH GO

02:34:13.844 --> 02:34:16.146
AHEAD YOU AND MY WIFE I WAS

02:34:16.213 --> 02:34:18.015
PREPARING FOR THIS AND SHE

02:34:18.082 --> 02:34:19.683
HAD THE EXACT SAME REACTION

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:22.219
SHE WAS LIKE WAIT A MINUTE I I

02:34:22.286 --> 02:34:23.887
WOULD ASSUME THIS AND KEEP IN

02:34:23.954 --> 02:34:26.090
MIND ASIDE FROM THE LEVEL OF

02:34:26.156 --> 02:34:28.859
ACUITY OF PATIENTS COMING FROM

02:34:28.926 --> 02:34:31.261
THE HOSPITAL THE RESIDENTS IN

02:34:31.328 --> 02:34:33.330
OUR FACILITIES HAVE MULTIPLE

02:34:33.397 --> 02:34:36.967
MEDICAL ISSUES AND AND AND SO

02:34:37.935 --> 02:34:39.069
THERE'S ACTUALLY A COUPLE KEY

02:34:39.136 --> 02:34:41.271
POINTS HERE FACILITIES WITH

02:34:41.338 --> 02:34:42.806
UNDER NINETY NINE BEDS ARE

02:34:42.873 --> 02:34:44.875
NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A TWENTY

02:34:44.942 --> 02:34:48.278
FOUR SEVEN RM AND WE NEED TO

02:34:48.345 --> 02:34:50.648
CHANGE THAT BECAUSE AS YOU

02:34:50.714 --> 02:34:52.349
SAID IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

02:34:52.416 --> 02:34:55.219
SOMEONE'S NOT FEELING GOOD WHO

02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:57.621
CAN EVALUATE THEM THAT HAS ANY

02:34:57.688 --> 02:34:59.923
LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL

02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:02.159
EXPERTISE AND IT MUST BE A

02:35:02.226 --> 02:35:03.994
REGISTERED NURSE NOW WE HAVE

02:35:04.061 --> 02:35:05.429
TO GO BEYOND THAT BECAUSE IN

02:35:05.496 --> 02:35:06.964
LARGER SIZE BUILDINGS THERE

02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:11.535
MAY BE AN RN LOW SURPRISINGLY

02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:13.570
EVEN THOUGH IT'S REQUIRED FOR

02:35:13.637 --> 02:35:14.805
THERE TO BE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN

02:35:14.872 --> 02:35:16.940
ARE IN FOR FACILITIES GREATER

02:35:17.007 --> 02:35:19.576
THAN A HUNDRED BADS THAT

02:35:19.643 --> 02:35:21.812
DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN AND AND

02:35:21.879 --> 02:35:23.013
I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:25.382
REALLY NEEDS TO BE MONITORED

02:35:25.449 --> 02:35:27.317
BY THE STATE AS WELL BUT EVEN

02:35:27.384 --> 02:35:30.387
EVEN WITH AN TWENTY FOUR HOUR

02:35:30.688 --> 02:35:34.458
NURSE AVAILABLE IF THINGS GO

02:35:34.525 --> 02:35:36.093
WRONG WITH A FEW PATIENTS AT

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:37.561
THE SAME TIME IF YOU RESIDENTS

02:35:37.628 --> 02:35:40.631
AT THE SAME TIME ONE PERSON

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:42.232
IS NOT ENOUGH AND AND THAT'S

02:35:42.299 --> 02:35:44.168
WHERE THE POINT SEVEN FIVE

02:35:44.234 --> 02:35:47.037
ALL RAN PER TWENTY FOUR HOURS

02:35:47.104 --> 02:35:48.939
PER RESIDENT PER DAY COMES IN

02:35:49.006 --> 02:35:51.375
THAT DR HARRINGTON SPOKE OF

02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:52.876
AND YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVE TO

02:35:52.943 --> 02:35:55.612
REALIZE THAT WE'RE NOT WE'RE

02:35:55.679 --> 02:35:57.681
NOT RENTING APARTMENTS HERE

02:35:57.748 --> 02:35:59.983
WE'RE RUNNING MANY HOSPITALS

02:36:00.384 --> 02:36:03.053
AND AT THE VERY LEAST WE

02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:05.322
NEED A REGISTERED NURSE WHO'S

02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:07.091
AVAILABLE WHO'S NOT PULLED

02:36:07.157 --> 02:36:09.827
IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS AND I

02:36:09.893 --> 02:36:12.296
HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MY HEART

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:14.732
BREAKS FOR THE STORIES I HEARD

02:36:14.798 --> 02:36:17.067
NICOLE HOW TALL AND AND OTHERS

02:36:17.134 --> 02:36:19.670
IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN

02:36:19.737 --> 02:36:21.305
UNDERSTAFFED THE SAUDIS RIGHT

02:36:21.371 --> 02:36:24.174
NOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT

02:36:24.241 --> 02:36:27.511
AND DURING CODED THERE'S A

02:36:27.578 --> 02:36:29.179
LOT MORE COMPLEXITY THAN WE'VE

02:36:29.246 --> 02:36:31.448
EVER HAD IN SO THE NEED FOR

02:36:31.515 --> 02:36:33.951
THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN POINT

02:36:34.017 --> 02:36:38.455
SEVEN FIVE FULL STAFFING IS

02:36:38.522 --> 02:36:40.891
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IF WE'RE

02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:43.360
GOING TO PROVIDE EVEN A MODICUM

02:36:43.427 --> 02:36:46.029
OF CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES

02:36:46.096 --> 02:36:48.132

DIRECTOR SAID AND YOU ALSO

02:36:51.769 --> 02:36:52.803
MENTIONED THAT THE COURSE IS

02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:54.638
NOT TERRIBLY ONEROUS AND MEET

02:36:54.705 --> 02:36:55.873
WITH IS PROBABLY TECHNICALLY

02:36:55.939 --> 02:36:56.974
ONEROUS BUT AS FAR AS THE

02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:58.408
TIME INVOLVED IT'S A THREE

02:36:58.475 --> 02:37:01.044
THREE DAY COURSE HI AND --

02:37:01.111 --> 02:37:02.079
YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT RURAL

02:37:02.146 --> 02:37:04.148
COMMUNITIES WHERE WE'RE OFTEN

02:37:04.681 --> 02:37:06.717
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO EVEN

02:37:06.784 --> 02:37:08.318
FIND A DOCTOR WHO COULD YOU

02:37:08.385 --> 02:37:10.354
KNOW WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO BE

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:12.890
ON PAPER THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR

02:37:12.956 --> 02:37:16.093
-- HAVE YOU THOUGHT IN JAIL

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.961
YOU KNOW ABOUT OTHER POTENTIAL

02:37:18.028 --> 02:37:19.329
PROVIDERS WHO C° MIGHT BILL

02:37:19.396 --> 02:37:21.064
TO FILL ROLE LIKE THAT I JUST

02:37:21.131 --> 02:37:22.933
IN SOME COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.568
THERE YOU MAY NOT FIND A DOCTOR

02:37:24.635 --> 02:37:25.936
BUT THERE YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S

02:37:26.003 --> 02:37:27.137
A NURSE PRACTITIONER YOU KNOW

02:37:27.204 --> 02:37:29.339
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT BUT

02:37:29.406 --> 02:37:31.909
SOMEBODY WHO COULD BE ON SITE

02:37:31.975 --> 02:37:33.777
MORE BECAUSE I MY SENSE IS

02:37:33.844 --> 02:37:35.312
THAT A LOT OF THIS IS THERE

02:37:35.379 --> 02:37:37.114
ON PAPER MORE THAN THEIR ON

02:37:37.181 --> 02:37:40.050
SITE AND AND THAT THAT'S IN

02:37:40.117 --> 02:37:41.318
THERE IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

02:37:41.385 --> 02:37:42.886
FROM YOUR CONVERSATION THAT

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:45.522
THERE REALLY IN INVOLVED IN IN

02:37:45.589 --> 02:37:47.524
DECISIONS AROUND THE MEDICAL

02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:50.227
TREATMENT OF OF AS FAR AS THE

02:37:50.294 --> 02:37:51.762
TREATMENT OF THE OF THE REAR

02:37:51.829 --> 02:37:52.963
OF THE RESIDENCE IT SOUNDS

02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:54.798
MORE LIKE A AN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:37:54.865 --> 02:37:56.900
POSITION -- WHERE THEY KIND

02:37:56.967 --> 02:37:58.569
OF COME IN AND YOU KNOW SIGNED

02:37:58.635 --> 02:37:59.903
A FEW PAPERS OCCASIONALLY AND

02:37:59.970 --> 02:38:00.971
THEN AND THEN THEN THEY'RE

02:38:01.038 --> 02:38:03.874
GONNA GET SO -- YEAH IF THE

02:38:03.941 --> 02:38:07.044
GOAL IS TO HAVE BETTER CARE

02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:08.145
THE CERTIFICATION MAKES A

02:38:08.212 --> 02:38:09.580
DIFFERENCE BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY

02:38:09.646 --> 02:38:10.681
SETTINGS WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE

02:38:10.747 --> 02:38:12.583
REALLY DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT

02:38:12.649 --> 02:38:15.118
NOW BUT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO

02:38:15.185 --> 02:38:18.589
GET GET STAFF -- TO TO DO THIS

02:38:18.655 --> 02:38:21.959
JOB KNOW THAT THAT IS A GREAT

02:38:22.025 --> 02:38:25.028
QUESTION -- SOME WOMEN AND AND

02:38:25.095 --> 02:38:26.630
-- FIRST OFF THAT THE COURSE

02:38:26.697 --> 02:38:29.700
HAS ONLINE COURSEWORK AND THEN

02:38:29.766 --> 02:38:31.802
IT ENDS WITH A THREE DAY SORT

02:38:31.869 --> 02:38:34.238
OF WRAP UP -- THEY USED TO BE

02:38:34.304 --> 02:38:37.541
IN PERSON BUT IS NOW VIRTUAL --

02:38:37.608 --> 02:38:39.910
BUT YOU KNOW RURAL AREAS HAVE

02:38:39.977 --> 02:38:42.145
STRUGGLED REGARDING NURSING

02:38:42.212 --> 02:38:44.581
HOMES FOR FOR AS LONG AS I'VE

02:38:44.648 --> 02:38:45.949
BEEN A GERIATRICIAN WHICH IS

02:38:46.016 --> 02:38:48.518
OVER THIRTY YEARS AND ACTUALLY

02:38:48.585 --> 02:38:50.354
BACK WHEN I WAS IN COLORADO WE

02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:51.822
WE ACTUALLY HAD A GRANT TO GO

02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:53.323
OUT TO RURAL AREAS TO TRY TO

02:38:53.390 --> 02:38:55.626
HELP PHYSICIANS DEAL WITH THEIR

02:38:55.692 --> 02:38:58.829
OLDER POPULATION AND SO THIS IS

02:38:58.896 --> 02:39:00.697
AN ONGOING PROBLEM WHETHER IT'S

02:39:00.764 --> 02:39:02.666
ACTUALLY HELPING CLINICIANS

02:39:02.933 --> 02:39:05.469
WHO GO TO THE FACILITIES OR

02:39:05.535 --> 02:39:07.337
HAVING A MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHO

02:39:07.404 --> 02:39:09.606
IS ON SITE AT THE FACILITY --

02:39:09.673 --> 02:39:11.808
AND IN RURAL AREAS OFTEN THE

02:39:11.875 --> 02:39:13.410
PERSON WHO SEES PATIENTS IS

02:39:13.477 --> 02:39:14.845
ALSO GOING TO BE THE MEDICAL

02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:16.747
DIRECTOR WHICH HAS SOME OF ITS

02:39:16.813 --> 02:39:19.383
OWN CHALLENGES BUT I THINK ONE

02:39:19.449 --> 02:39:20.851
OF THE THINGS WE'VE WARM DURING

02:39:20.918 --> 02:39:23.887
COLD IT IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:39:23.954 --> 02:39:26.223
PROVIDE TELEHEALTH TELEMEDICINE

02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:29.459
VIRTUAL AVAILABILITY IN FACT --

02:39:29.526 --> 02:39:31.428
THE FACILITY I MEDICAL DIRECTOR

02:39:31.495 --> 02:39:34.464
OF -- BECAUSE MY AGENT AND I

02:39:34.531 --> 02:39:36.233
HAD ASTHMA AS A KID MY WIFE

02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:37.968
HAS SOME IMMUNO COMPROMISED I

02:39:38.035 --> 02:39:40.337
HAVEN'T BEEN IN THAT FACILITY

02:39:40.404 --> 02:39:42.439
SINCE SINCE THE ONSET OF KOBE

02:39:42.506 --> 02:39:45.342
BUT I HAVE CONTINUE TO INTERACT

02:39:45.409 --> 02:39:47.210
WITH THE STAFF IN IN AND IN

02:39:47.277 --> 02:39:48.378
WITH WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF

02:39:48.445 --> 02:39:51.748
THE FACILITY SO THERE ARE MANY

02:39:51.815 --> 02:39:54.051
WAYS FOR ANY IN FACT I THINK

02:39:54.117 --> 02:39:56.153
ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS HERE FOR

02:39:56.219 --> 02:39:58.188
RURAL AREAS IS GOING TO BE

02:39:58.255 --> 02:40:00.557
PROVIDING TELEHEALTH TO THE

02:40:00.624 --> 02:40:02.259
NURSING HOMES FOR BOTH CLINICAL

02:40:02.326 --> 02:40:04.227
CARE AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR

02:40:04.294 --> 02:40:06.363
LEADERSHIP AND YOU KNOW TO

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:08.799
YOUR TO YOUR POINT MOST MEDICAL

02:40:08.865 --> 02:40:11.201
DIRECTORS UNFORTUNATELY GET

02:40:11.268 --> 02:40:13.603
A NICE STIPEND AND FOR THAT

02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:15.305
STIPEND THEY GO IN AND THEY

02:40:15.372 --> 02:40:16.606
SPEND AN HOUR OR TWO A MONTH

02:40:16.673 --> 02:40:18.742
SIGNING PAPERS THAT IS NOT

02:40:18.809 --> 02:40:20.444
WHAT THE RAGS MEANT THEM TO

02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:22.212
DO THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE

02:40:22.279 --> 02:40:23.914
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:40:23.981 --> 02:40:26.249
WE NEED THEM TO DO AND ONE OF

02:40:26.316 --> 02:40:28.352
THE THINGS THAT REALLY I FEEL

02:40:28.418 --> 02:40:30.053
STRONGLY ABOUT YOU KNOW I'M A

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:31.621
PROFESSIONAL YOUR PROFESSIONAL

02:40:32.255 --> 02:40:34.124
IF A PHYSICIAN DOESN'T HAVE

02:40:34.191 --> 02:40:36.426
THE TOOLS AND THE TRAINING THEN

02:40:36.493 --> 02:40:37.194
THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE

02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:38.595
THEIR OWN EXPECTATION OF WHAT

02:40:38.662 --> 02:40:40.797
THEY CAN DO BUT ONCE YOU PUT

02:40:40.864 --> 02:40:43.100
IN THEIR HANDS THE TRAINING

02:40:43.166 --> 02:40:46.403
THE TOOLS FOR SKILLS NINETY

02:40:46.470 --> 02:40:47.904
FIVE PERCENT OF POSITIONS

02:40:47.971 --> 02:40:49.906
THAT I KNOW WILL TAKE THAT

02:40:49.973 --> 02:40:52.342
RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY AND

GOING TO GET MORE INVOLVED IN

02:40:59.149 --> 02:41:01.918
WHETHER A FACILITY IS UP TO

02:41:01.985 --> 02:41:04.588
SPEED STAFFING WISE IN ORDER

WHEN THE STATE ACTUALLY TRIED

02:41:12.462 --> 02:41:13.930

02:48:00.370 --> 02:48:03.873
OF ATTACHED TO IT -- I THINK

02:48:04.107 --> 02:48:06.576

02:53:24.861 --> 02:53:26.395
THEN THERE'S A LIMITATION ON

02:53:26.462 --> 02:53:27.764
HOW MUCH THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET

02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:29.832
BASED ON THE OVERALL IN THE

02:53:29.899 --> 02:53:31.768
LIMIT THE OVERALL INCREASE IN

02:53:31.834 --> 02:53:33.736
THE MEDIC CAL RATE SO THEY ARE

02:53:33.803 --> 02:53:36.005
CONSTRAINED AT MULTIPLE LAYERS

02:53:38.074 --> 02:53:40.009
I GET THE CONSTRAINTS THAT YOU

02:53:40.076 --> 02:53:41.978
KNOW CONSTRAINTS ARE PUT INTO

02:53:42.044 --> 02:53:44.781
PLACE SO THAT WE WE WE TRY TO

02:53:44.847 --> 02:53:46.382
YEAH WE TRY TO PROVIDE THE BEST

02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:48.217
SERVICE WE CAN BASED ON THE

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:50.253
DOLLARS PROVIDED AND SOMETIMES

02:53:50.319 --> 02:53:52.054
THOSE AREN'T ENOUGH BUT THEN

02:53:52.121 --> 02:53:55.258
THERE'S ALWAYS -- -- WAYS TO

02:53:55.324 --> 02:53:56.893
TO TO TO MOON MANEUVER AROUND

02:53:56.959 --> 02:54:00.029
THAT -- NEATLY WE RECENTLY IN

02:54:00.096 --> 02:54:01.130
THE LIGHT AND THIS LAST TERM

02:54:01.197 --> 02:54:04.033
TOOK STEPS FOR EXAMPLE -- IN

02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:06.169
IN THE -- A PUBLIC EDUCATION

02:54:06.235 --> 02:54:08.304
CHARTER REALM WHERE WE SAID

02:54:08.371 --> 02:54:10.640
IF YOU ARE A OPERATOR OF THE

02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:13.409
CHARTER SCHOOL YOU CAN NOT OWN

02:54:13.476 --> 02:54:15.244
THE LAND THAT YOU'RE PAYING

02:54:15.311 --> 02:54:18.447
LEAST TO SO THAT THAT WAY IT

02:54:18.514 --> 02:54:23.019
CUTS POTENTIALLY ANY -- ANY

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:27.223
-- BUT IT BASICALLY TAKES AWAY

02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:30.159
ANY POTENTIAL MOTIVES OF MAY

02:54:30.226 --> 02:54:31.727
BE PAYING A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:54:31.794 --> 02:54:33.362
THAN THE MARKET RATE OR AT THE

02:54:33.429 --> 02:54:34.931
HIGHEST LEVEL OF MARKET RATES

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:36.699
FOR LEASE -- ESPECIALLY AT

02:54:36.766 --> 02:54:38.234
A TIME LIKE THIS WHEN MARKET

02:54:38.301 --> 02:54:39.902
RATES ARE AT ALL TIME HIGH

02:54:39.969 --> 02:54:41.704
WE KNOW THERE'S A THAT THE I

02:54:41.771 --> 02:54:43.072
COULD NOT WOULD NOT KNOW WE ARE

02:54:43.139 --> 02:54:44.473
IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IT'S

02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:45.775
JUST WE HAVEN'T FELT THE FULL

02:54:45.842 --> 02:54:49.345
EFFECTS OF IT YET AND SO WE

02:54:49.412 --> 02:54:52.181
CAN BE SETTING PRICES RIGHT NOW

02:54:52.248 --> 02:54:54.317
YET IN THE IN THE COMING YEARS

02:54:54.383 --> 02:54:57.720
THAT RATES MAY NOT BE REALLY

02:54:57.787 --> 02:54:59.021
THE RATES THAT SHOULD BE PAID

02:54:59.088 --> 02:55:00.656
BECAUSE THE MARKET ISN'T THERE

02:55:00.723 --> 02:55:02.258
SO THERE'S A LOT OF THESE GAMES

02:55:02.325 --> 02:55:04.227
MANSHIP THAT UNFORTUNATELY CAN

02:55:04.293 --> 02:55:07.730
CAN TAKE PLACE -- SO I DON'T

02:55:07.797 --> 02:55:09.165
KNOW IF -- MY COLLEAGUE DR

02:55:09.232 --> 02:55:10.266
WOULD WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS

02:55:10.333 --> 02:55:11.734
BUT BUT I THINK SOMETHING ALONG

02:55:11.801 --> 02:55:14.303
THE LINES OF ENSURING THAT --

02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:16.439
HOUSING THAT THAT THAT THAT

02:55:16.505 --> 02:55:20.042
THAT -- -- OWNER OPERATORS

02:55:20.109 --> 02:55:22.979
ARE ALSO THIS INVESTED FROM

02:55:23.246 --> 02:55:25.681
OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY --

02:55:25.748 --> 02:55:27.950
UP POTENTIALLY HELPS ADDRESS

02:55:28.384 --> 02:55:29.752
AT LEAST ONE OF THESE ISSUES

02:55:29.819 --> 02:55:31.120
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD

02:55:31.187 --> 02:55:32.788
CARE TO COMMENT MISTER CORNET

02:55:32.855 --> 02:55:34.957
ON THAT -- BUT I'D ALSO LIKE

02:55:35.024 --> 02:55:36.158
TO I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU

02:55:36.225 --> 02:55:38.227
AS WELL AS FROM DR WASSERMAN

02:55:38.294 --> 02:55:39.595
YEAH I I WOULD PROBABLY NEED

02:55:39.662 --> 02:55:40.997
TO UNDERSTAND A BIT MORE WHAT

02:55:41.063 --> 02:55:41.831
YOU TALK ABOUT I WILL JUST

02:55:41.898 --> 02:55:44.600
TELL YOU THIS THOUGH DID MANY

02:55:44.667 --> 02:55:46.736
FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY

02:55:46.802 --> 02:55:48.304
LESS SO IN CALIFORNIA THAT MANY

02:55:48.371 --> 02:55:49.772
FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY

02:55:49.839 --> 02:55:51.474
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

02:55:51.540 --> 02:55:53.042
MAKE IT AND HAVE GONE BANKRUPT

02:55:53.109 --> 02:55:54.310
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS

02:55:54.377 --> 02:55:55.745
THE CAUSE OF THAT HAS BEEN THE

02:55:55.811 --> 02:55:57.747
READS THE REEDS M.

02:55:57.813 --> 02:55:59.215
AND THE OWNERSHIP OF THE AT

02:55:59.282 --> 02:56:00.683
THE OF THE LAND THAT HAS BEEN

02:56:00.750 --> 02:56:02.385
A MAJOR PROBLEM IN MANY PARTS

02:56:02.451 --> 02:56:03.853
OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:05.221
AS THE REEDS HAVE INCREASED

02:56:05.288 --> 02:56:07.156
THE THE THE LEAST COST --

02:56:07.223 --> 02:56:08.658
THAT IS -- SOMETHING THAT THE

02:56:08.724 --> 02:56:10.526
POLICE ARE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

02:56:10.593 --> 02:56:12.828
MANAGE -- GIVEN THAT SO I SAID

02:56:12.895 --> 02:56:14.330
BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT ANYTHING

02:56:14.397 --> 02:56:15.865
THAT WE LOOK AT HERE GIVEN THE

02:56:15.932 --> 02:56:17.066
EXPERIENCE WE'VE SEEN OTHER

02:56:17.133 --> 02:56:20.403
STATES SO YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE

02:56:20.469 --> 02:56:21.404
SEEN THAT IN OTHER STATES

02:56:21.470 --> 02:56:22.538
BUT IS THAT BEEN THE ISSUE IN

02:56:22.605 --> 02:56:23.906
CALIFORNIA THAT HAS BEEN AN

02:56:23.973 --> 02:56:25.441
ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL

02:56:25.508 --> 02:56:26.409
UNDERSTAND I DON'T THINK IT

02:56:26.475 --> 02:56:28.344
HAS BEEN AS DRAMATIC IT TURNS

02:56:28.411 --> 02:56:30.680
UP AT FORCING FACILITIES INTO

02:56:30.746 --> 02:56:32.848
FORECLOSURE AND INTO BANKRUPTCY

02:56:32.915 --> 02:56:34.350
AS MUCH BUT IT IS DEFINITELY

02:56:34.417 --> 02:56:36.118
AN ISSUE HERE -- BECAUSE WE'VE

02:56:36.185 --> 02:56:38.087
SEEN THAT THE THE THE BREEDS

02:56:38.154 --> 02:56:40.256
HAVE RUN UP THE COST YOU KNOW

02:56:40.323 --> 02:56:41.590
TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DON'T

02:56:41.657 --> 02:56:42.525
THAT IT THERE'S DIFFERENT

02:56:42.591 --> 02:56:43.859
MODELS THERE'S DIFFERENT MODELS

02:56:43.926 --> 02:56:46.429
OUT THERE SOME FACILITIES --

02:56:46.495 --> 02:56:48.030
YOU KNOW ONE OF THEIR IT I JUST

02:56:48.097 --> 02:56:49.231
THINK OF ONE LOCAL FACILITY

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:50.666
HERE THAT'S BEEN A FAMILY

02:56:50.733 --> 02:56:51.901
OPERATED FACILITY FOR THREE

02:56:51.968 --> 02:56:53.836
GENERATIONS THAT THAT FACILITY

02:56:53.903 --> 02:56:55.471
OWNER OWNS THE FACILITY AND

02:56:55.538 --> 02:56:56.906
ALSO OPERATES THE BUILDING

02:56:56.973 --> 02:56:58.841
TO IN MANY CASES SOMEONE ELSE

02:56:58.908 --> 02:57:00.209
OWNS THE FACILITY IT OWNS THE

02:57:00.276 --> 02:57:01.811
LAND UNDER THE DIRT IF YOU

02:57:01.877 --> 02:57:03.679
WILL AND THE FACILITY AND AND

02:57:03.746 --> 02:57:05.247
AND THE OPERATOR THAT HAS THAT

02:57:05.314 --> 02:57:07.116
OPERATES THE FACILITY AND THEN

02:57:07.183 --> 02:57:08.351
A MAJOR PART OF WHAT THEY HAVE

02:57:08.417 --> 02:57:09.385
TO PAY THEM THAT'S HAVE TO PAY

02:57:09.452 --> 02:57:11.153
THAT THE COST OF THE THE THE

02:57:11.220 --> 02:57:13.322
LEASE AND -- AND USUALLY TO

02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:16.959
A REPEAT OKAY WELL I I RAISE

02:57:17.026 --> 02:57:17.760
THIS BECAUSE I THINK THERE

02:57:17.827 --> 02:57:19.128
NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR DISTINCTION

02:57:19.195 --> 02:57:20.930
BETWEEN THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE

02:57:20.997 --> 02:57:22.431
PROPERTY AND THE PERSON WHO'S

02:57:22.498 --> 02:57:24.200
GETTING INTO THE BUSINESS AND

02:57:24.266 --> 02:57:26.068
IS GONNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

02:57:26.135 --> 02:57:28.671
DOLLAR IS INVESTED FOR THE BEST

02:57:28.738 --> 02:57:31.040
INTEREST OF THE BEST INTEREST

02:57:31.107 --> 02:57:33.576
OF THE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES --

02:57:33.642 --> 02:57:35.745
AND AND THE BEST A PROVIDING

02:57:35.811 --> 02:57:37.346
THE BEST SERVICE THROUGH A

02:57:37.413 --> 02:57:40.016
MODEL THAT DAY NO WORKS RATHER

02:57:40.082 --> 02:57:43.686
THAN MAKING SURE THAT -- -- --

02:57:43.886 --> 02:57:47.723
VARIOUS COSTS ARE ARE ADDRESSED

02:57:47.957 --> 02:57:50.092
AND THEN THERE ISN'T MUCH LEFT

02:57:50.159 --> 02:57:52.228
FOR FOR THE SERVICES THAT NEED

02:57:52.294 --> 02:57:54.230
TO BE RENDERED OR PROVIDED IT'S

02:57:54.296 --> 02:57:56.399
A VERY CLEAR DISTINCTION FOR ME

02:57:56.465 --> 02:57:59.335
AND I I I I I AGAIN THAT'S WHY

02:57:59.402 --> 02:58:02.638
WE TOOK STEPS IN THE CHARTER

02:58:02.705 --> 02:58:04.840
ARENA -- CHAR AT EDUCATION

02:58:04.907 --> 02:58:06.442
ARENA TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:58:06.509 --> 02:58:09.111
MOTIVATION WAS NOT NOT THERE

02:58:09.612 --> 02:58:11.347
-- AND AND MAYBE THAT'S

02:58:11.414 --> 02:58:12.348
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:14.450
ALSO I'M CERTAINLY GONNA WANT

02:58:14.517 --> 02:58:16.419
TO LOOK AT -- IN THE COMING

02:58:16.485 --> 02:58:19.422
YEAR BECAUSE -- BESIDES THAT

02:58:19.488 --> 02:58:20.890
WE WE'VE SEEN THIS IN OTHER

02:58:20.956 --> 02:58:22.858
SETTINGS IN GROUP HOMES IN

02:58:22.925 --> 02:58:24.026
MANY OTHER SETTINGS WHERE THE

02:58:24.093 --> 02:58:25.361
STATE WILL PROVIDE A CERTAIN

02:58:25.428 --> 02:58:26.796
DOLLARS CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

02:58:26.862 --> 02:58:31.000
DOLLARS -- AND AND I WONDER TO

02:58:31.067 --> 02:58:32.435
WHAT EXTENT SOME OF THESE FOLKS

02:58:32.501 --> 02:58:34.937
WHO CONDUCT THIS BUSINESS ONCE

02:58:35.004 --> 02:58:36.472
THEIR PROPERTY HAS PAID OFF

02:58:36.539 --> 02:58:39.708
WILL THEN -- BUT QUITE SIMPLY

02:58:39.775 --> 02:58:41.043
EVEN EITHER SELL THE BUSINESS

02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:42.778
OR ABANDON THE BUSINESS SECTOR

02:58:42.845 --> 02:58:43.979
INTERESTED NOW TO KNOW IF

02:58:44.046 --> 02:58:45.815
THERE ARE SUCH IF THERE ARE

02:58:45.881 --> 02:58:49.285
ANY NUMBERS IN IN THAT -- BUT

02:58:49.351 --> 02:58:50.920
-- BUT THIS IS I'M GOING INTO

02:58:50.986 --> 02:58:52.354
AREAS THAT I WAS EVEN THINKING

02:58:52.421 --> 02:58:54.156
UP BEFORE THIS HEARING SO I

02:58:54.223 --> 02:58:56.525
I'D BE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE

02:58:56.592 --> 02:58:58.461
-- CURIOUS TO EXPLORE THAT

02:58:58.527 --> 02:59:00.729
AS WELL MISTER WASSERMAN DO

02:59:00.796 --> 02:59:02.665
YOU DO YOU -- WOULD YOU LIKE

02:59:02.731 --> 02:59:04.300
TO COMMENT ON SOME OF THE

02:59:04.366 --> 02:59:05.668
QUESTIONS I'M ASKING ABOUT THE

02:59:05.734 --> 02:59:08.104
RELATED PARTY -- COMPANIES AND

02:59:08.170 --> 02:59:11.006
AND CERTAIN PRACTICES AND AND

02:59:11.073 --> 02:59:13.576
AND THE LEVEL OF ENFORCEMENT

02:59:35.965 --> 02:59:37.199
SO THERE'S A BIT OF A TIME

02:59:37.266 --> 02:59:38.634
DELAY SO I WAS JUST LISTENING

02:59:38.701 --> 02:59:40.903
TO THE END OF THE QUESTION

02:59:40.970 --> 02:59:43.339
-- I'M ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY

02:59:43.405 --> 02:59:44.907
PLEASED THAT MISTER CORNET

02:59:44.974 --> 02:59:46.809
BROUGHT UP THE REIT'S I I

02:59:46.876 --> 02:59:49.311
COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT THE

02:59:49.378 --> 02:59:52.014
REAL ESTATE PRESSURE ON NURSING

02:59:52.081 --> 02:59:53.949
HOMES HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING

02:59:54.016 --> 02:59:56.352
ISSUE AND IF YOU ACTUALLY

02:59:56.418 --> 02:59:58.187
LOOK AT SOME OF THE LARGE EVEN

02:59:58.254 --> 03:00:00.156
PUBLICLY TRADED NURSING HOME

03:00:00.222 --> 03:00:03.125
COMPANIES THE READS SIT ON

03:00:03.192 --> 03:00:05.728
THE BOARDS OF THOSE COMPANIES

03:00:06.095 --> 03:00:08.831
IF YOU THEN LOOK AT OWNERS

03:00:08.898 --> 03:00:10.299
OF NURSING HOMES AS WELL

03:00:10.366 --> 03:00:12.067
AS OWNING NURSING HOMES AND

03:00:12.134 --> 03:00:14.270
OPERATIONS WHEN YOU HAVE THE

03:00:14.336 --> 03:00:17.606
SAME PEOPLE OWNING THE LAND

03:00:17.673 --> 03:00:19.041
OWNING THE REAL ESTATE AND

03:00:19.108 --> 03:00:21.710
OWNING THE PROPERTY AS MISTER

03:00:21.777 --> 03:00:23.979
CORNET IS VERY SKILLFUL YOU

03:00:24.046 --> 03:00:25.181
KNOW VERY CORRECTLY POINTED

03:00:25.247 --> 03:00:27.816
OUT THEY CAN APPLY PRESSURE

03:00:27.883 --> 03:00:29.919
TO THE OPERATIONS THAT CAN

03:00:29.985 --> 03:00:32.221
IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED

03:00:32.288 --> 03:00:34.523
AND OFTEN END UP LEADING THEM

03:00:34.590 --> 03:00:36.158
INTO BANKRUPTCY IF THE THAT

03:00:36.225 --> 03:00:37.493
PRESSURE IS TOO GREAT I MEAN

03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:39.195
THERE THERE ARE MERELY A NUMBER

03:00:39.261 --> 03:00:40.462
OF EXAMPLES OF THIS OVER THE

03:00:40.529 --> 03:00:42.965
LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS SO I

03:00:43.032 --> 03:00:45.301
ACTUALLY THINK A MISCONDUCT HAS

03:00:45.367 --> 03:00:48.837
HAS REALLY -- HELPED EXPLAIN

03:00:49.405 --> 03:00:51.340
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NONE

03:00:51.407 --> 03:00:53.175
TOWARD PRESSURES FROM REAL

03:00:53.242 --> 03:00:56.445
ESTATE ON THE OPERATIONS OF

03:00:56.512 --> 03:00:58.080
NURSING HOMES THAT ARE MEANT

03:00:58.147 --> 03:01:01.150
TO BE PLACES WHERE WE PROVIDE

03:01:01.217 --> 03:01:03.252
CARE FOR VERY VULNERABLE

03:01:03.319 --> 03:01:05.087
PEOPLE AND WE REALLY NEED

03:01:05.154 --> 03:01:07.323
TO LOOK FOR A WAY OF EITHER

03:01:07.389 --> 03:01:09.391
SEPARATING OUT THIS PRESSURE

03:01:09.592 --> 03:01:11.727
MAKING CHANGES TO IT -- AND I

03:01:11.794 --> 03:01:13.462
THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF --

03:01:13.529 --> 03:01:16.532
IDEAS THAT COULD BE OUT THERE

03:01:19.001 --> 03:01:21.570
VERY INTERESTED TO TO DISCUSS

03:01:21.637 --> 03:01:22.771
ALL THESE DIFFERENT PRESSURE

03:01:22.838 --> 03:01:25.441
POINTS AND SEEING -- HOW WE

03:01:25.507 --> 03:01:28.744
CAN START IMPLEMENTING -- ALL

03:01:28.811 --> 03:01:29.745
OF THESE DIFFERENT PRESSURE

03:01:29.812 --> 03:01:32.147
POINTS INTO SOME KIND OF AN

03:01:32.214 --> 03:01:34.416
EXECUTE HERBAL EITHER POLICY

03:01:34.483 --> 03:01:37.353
OR LEGISLATION THAT THAT STARTS

03:01:37.419 --> 03:01:41.557
STARTS -- UNTANGLING CERTAIN

03:01:42.391 --> 03:01:44.393
INFLUENCES FROM BEING ABLE TO

03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:46.629
DELIVER THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE

03:01:46.695 --> 03:01:48.998
AS WELL I I I THINK I THINK

03:01:49.064 --> 03:01:51.300
IT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP ALSO

03:01:51.367 --> 03:01:55.938
CALF -- -- -- WITHIN ITS OWN

03:01:56.138 --> 03:01:59.041
INSTITUTION TO TO BE ABLE TO --

03:01:59.108 --> 03:02:01.677
BABIES MAKE THOSE SEPARATIONS

03:02:02.077 --> 03:02:03.612
-- BY THE WAY SINCE SINCE

03:02:03.679 --> 03:02:05.214
DOCTORS -- WASSERMAN YOUR SINCE

03:02:05.281 --> 03:02:06.315
YOU'RE OUT YOU'RE THERE RIGHT

03:02:06.382 --> 03:02:09.118
NOW IS -- YOU STARTED TOUCHING

03:02:09.184 --> 03:02:10.853
ON THE -- THE VACCINE TASK

03:02:10.919 --> 03:02:13.989
FORCE AND THE IT GERIATRIC

03:02:14.056 --> 03:02:16.525
-- MEDICINE BACKGROUND DO

03:02:16.592 --> 03:02:19.628
YOU KNOW HOW MANY MEMBERS

03:02:19.695 --> 03:02:22.698
THERE ARE ON THE TASK FORCE

03:02:58.901 --> 03:03:01.904
SO THE THE GOVERNOR HAS SOME

03:03:02.471 --> 03:03:04.373
PUT TOGETHER A WORK GROUP

03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:07.476
TO DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND

03:03:07.543 --> 03:03:10.813
EFFICACY OF THE VACCINE AND

03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:14.616
KEEP IN MIND MOST THE VACCINES

03:03:14.683 --> 03:03:15.551
THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT THAT

03:03:15.617 --> 03:03:18.687
ARE BEING TESTED RIGHT NOW --

03:03:18.754 --> 03:03:19.988
ONLY ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS

03:03:20.055 --> 03:03:21.523
EVEN VENTURED INTO NURSING

03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:23.792
HOMES TO TO HAVE THEM NURSING

03:03:23.859 --> 03:03:25.527
HOME RESIDENTS ENTERED INTO

03:03:25.594 --> 03:03:27.796
THOSE CLINICAL TRIALS I EVEN

03:03:27.863 --> 03:03:30.899
AMONGST THE OTHER ONES THE

03:03:30.966 --> 03:03:33.402
UPPER AGE IS OFTEN SIXTY FIVE

03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:35.604
OR SEVENTY FIVE WE DO HAVE

03:03:35.671 --> 03:03:37.172
SOME THAT DID GO UP TO EIGHTY

03:03:37.239 --> 03:03:38.941
FIVE AND THAT'S ENCOURAGING

03:03:39.007 --> 03:03:40.909
SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE FROM A

03:03:40.976 --> 03:03:42.211
STARTING POINT SO WHEN WHEN

03:03:42.277 --> 03:03:43.879
THIS VACCINE GETS APPROVED WE

03:03:43.946 --> 03:03:45.647
REALLY NEED TO EVALUATE IT AND

03:03:45.714 --> 03:03:47.883
IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY

03:03:47.950 --> 03:03:49.351
AND EFFICACY OF THIS VACCINE

03:03:49.418 --> 03:03:51.453
AS IT RELATES TO OLDER ADULTS

03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:54.790
WE WILL NEED COLLEAGUES OF MINE

03:03:54.857 --> 03:03:57.359
MY SEE FOLKS LIKE MYSELF WHO

03:03:57.426 --> 03:03:58.861
I HAVE EXPERTISE IN GERIATRICS

03:03:58.927 --> 03:04:00.629
AND LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE AND

03:04:00.696 --> 03:04:03.665

ALSO GOING INTO FACILITIES --

03:05:32.855 --> 03:05:34.356
IF THERE ARE A HIGH RISK FOR

03:05:34.423 --> 03:05:36.091
URGENT NEEDS ARE OUTBREAKS

03:05:36.158 --> 03:05:37.759

INTO AN OUTBREAK SITUATION

03:05:46.201 --> 03:05:47.469
OKAY SO WHAT AND WHAT IS THE

03:05:47.536 --> 03:05:49.338
END RESULT WHEN SOMEONE IS

03:05:56.211 --> 03:05:57.479
CERTAIN PARAMETERS FOR THEM TO

03:05:57.546 --> 03:05:59.481
MEET WHAT DO YOU WHAT STEPS TO

03:05:59.548 --> 03:06:03.952
TAKE NEXT SO IF IT IS A A STATE

03:06:04.019 --> 03:06:05.988
REGULATION THEN WE WILL DECIDE

03:06:06.054 --> 03:06:08.023
FOR A STATE REGULATION IF THERE

03:06:08.090 --> 03:06:09.525
IS A SITUATION THAT WARRANTS

03:06:09.591 --> 03:06:11.593
A FULL ON INVESTIGATION

03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:13.128
THOUGH FOR LIKE A COMPLAINER

03:06:13.195 --> 03:06:14.696
FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENT

03:06:14.997 --> 03:06:16.164
THEN WE USE OUR FEDERAL

03:06:16.231 --> 03:06:17.566
REGULATIONS AND THE FEDERAL

03:06:17.633 --> 03:06:20.335
REGULATIONS ARE STRICTER --

03:06:20.402 --> 03:06:22.638
AND -- ACCOUNTS I'M A LITTLE

03:06:22.704 --> 03:06:24.139
BIT MORE WEIGHT TO THEM THEN

03:06:24.206 --> 03:06:25.541
HONESTLY THAT OUR CURRENT STATE

03:06:25.607 --> 03:06:26.708
REGULATIONS BECAUSE OF MANY

03:06:26.775 --> 03:06:28.710
OF OUR TITLE TWENTY TWO --

03:06:28.777 --> 03:06:31.280
REGULATIONS NEED TO BE UPDATED

03:06:33.282 --> 03:06:35.017
SO IN THE LAST SIX SEVEN

03:06:35.083 --> 03:06:36.685
MONTHS HAVE WE SHUT DOWN

03:06:36.752 --> 03:06:38.420
ANY FACILITY YOU DO HAVE THE

03:06:38.487 --> 03:06:40.822
AUTHORITY TO DO THAT YEAH WE

03:06:40.889 --> 03:06:43.892
SHUT DOWN THE FACILITY HOW MANY

03:06:43.959 --> 03:06:46.428
WE HAVE DONE -- WELL I WILL

03:06:46.495 --> 03:06:47.563
TELL YOU THERE'S A COUPLE OF

03:06:47.629 --> 03:06:49.097
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS SO THERE

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:51.066
IS A REPLICATION PROCESS WHICH

03:06:51.133 --> 03:06:53.001
IS ONE WAY THAT WE DO IT AND

03:06:53.068 --> 03:06:54.603
WE DID DO A REVOCATION OF A

03:06:54.670 --> 03:06:57.406
LICENSE COMPLETELY AND PASADENA

03:06:58.106 --> 03:07:00.542
-- BUT WE ALSO -- HAVE DONE

03:07:00.609 --> 03:07:02.844
WHAT WE CALL JOINT ON TEMPORARY

03:07:02.911 --> 03:07:04.346
EVACUATIONS MEANING THAT WHERE

03:07:04.413 --> 03:07:06.048
WE HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE WITH

03:07:06.114 --> 03:07:07.649
THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER

03:07:07.716 --> 03:07:08.984
WERE OFTEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

03:07:09.051 --> 03:07:10.719
OFFICER IS DOING THE HEALTH

03:07:10.786 --> 03:07:11.820
ORDER AND WE ARE THEY ARE

03:07:11.887 --> 03:07:13.655
ON SITE WORKING WITH THEM TO

03:07:13.722 --> 03:07:15.457
EITHER DECOMPRESSOR FACILITY

03:07:15.524 --> 03:07:18.126
EVACUATED FACILITY -- AND THEN

03:07:18.193 --> 03:07:20.128
DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT

03:07:20.195 --> 03:07:21.863
-- THEY'RE ABLE TO STABILIZE

03:07:21.930 --> 03:07:23.298
THE SITUATION AND THEY MAY

03:07:23.365 --> 03:07:25.434
BE ABLE TO RESUME SERVICES

03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:27.002
AND THEN ANOTHER ENFORCEMENT

03:07:27.069 --> 03:07:28.170
ACTION THAT WE'RE TAKING IS

03:07:28.236 --> 03:07:30.005
PUTTING IN TEMPORARY MANAGERS

03:07:30.072 --> 03:07:31.840
SO THAT IS A AN INSTANCE WHERE

03:07:31.907 --> 03:07:34.042
WE HAVE -- A SITUATION THAT

03:07:34.109 --> 03:07:35.811
WE BELIEVE IS UNSAFE TO THE

03:07:35.877 --> 03:07:37.746
POINT WHERE WE NEED TO INSTILL

03:07:37.813 --> 03:07:39.948
A STATE TEMPORARY MANAGER

03:07:40.315 --> 03:07:41.316
AND THAT TEMPORARY MANAGER

03:07:41.383 --> 03:07:43.585
THEN TAKES OVER OPERATIONS ON

03:07:43.652 --> 03:07:46.655
BEHALF OF THE STATE -- INTEL IN

03:07:46.722 --> 03:07:48.857
SOME CASES IT LED TO A ACTUAL

03:07:48.924 --> 03:07:50.325
REPLICATION IN OTHER CASES

03:07:50.392 --> 03:07:52.060
THEY WERE ABLE TO STABILIZE

03:07:52.127 --> 03:07:53.128
THEY HAD THEIR CITATIONS

03:07:53.195 --> 03:07:54.529
THEY WENT MOVE THROUGH A DATE

03:07:54.596 --> 03:07:55.931
-- CORRECTED THEIR ACTIONS

03:07:55.998 --> 03:07:56.865
AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE TO

03:07:56.932 --> 03:07:59.267
RESUME -- OPERATING THEIR OWN

03:07:59.334 --> 03:08:00.836
FACILITY AND THEN WE REMOVE

03:08:00.902 --> 03:08:02.371
OUR TEMPORARY MANAGER SERVICE

03:08:02.437 --> 03:08:03.805
BEEN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES

03:08:03.872 --> 03:08:05.474
OF I WOULD SAY ON THE CONTINUUM

03:08:05.540 --> 03:08:08.377
OF ENFORCEMENT DO YOU HAVE

03:08:08.577 --> 03:08:10.278
NUMBERS GOING BACK TO MY PRE

03:08:10.345 --> 03:08:11.913
QUESTION AGAIN BUT HOW MANY

03:08:11.980 --> 03:08:14.416
DO YOU HAVE QUAN NUMBERS ON

03:08:14.483 --> 03:08:17.386
WHERE YOU ARE WITH THAT THE

03:08:17.452 --> 03:08:19.388
THREE OR FOUR LEVELS THAT YOU

03:08:19.454 --> 03:08:22.290
JUST DESCRIBED WILL UP HOW MANY

03:08:22.357 --> 03:08:24.326
IN EACH CATEGORY YOU HAVE AT

03:08:24.393 --> 03:08:27.262
THIS CURRENT STATE SO YOU MEAN

03:08:27.329 --> 03:08:28.764
JUST FOR THE PANDEMIC PERIOD

03:08:28.830 --> 03:08:30.065
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SINCE

03:08:30.132 --> 03:08:32.768
MARCH OKAY YES YES SO WE HAVE

03:08:32.834 --> 03:08:34.436
ONE FACILITY THAT WE HAVE DONE

03:08:34.503 --> 03:08:36.271
A FULL REVOCATION AND WE ARE

03:08:36.338 --> 03:08:38.306
GOING THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS

03:08:38.373 --> 03:08:40.609
-- OF THAT PIECE OF IT AND THEY

03:08:40.676 --> 03:08:42.110
DO NOT HAVE OPERATIONS AT THAT

03:08:42.177 --> 03:08:45.747
FACILITY WE HAVE ABOUT THREE OR

03:08:45.814 --> 03:08:47.149
FOUR DIFFERENT FACILITIES THAT

03:08:47.215 --> 03:08:49.084
WE HAVE ENTERED INTO EITHER

03:08:49.151 --> 03:08:51.153
A TEMPORARY MANAGER POSITION

03:08:51.386 --> 03:08:53.488
WHERE WE HAVE ON HOW TO TAKE

03:08:53.555 --> 03:08:55.457
FOR THE -- THE OPERATIONS

03:08:55.524 --> 03:08:56.792
TEMPORARILY IT BUT I CAN GET

03:08:56.858 --> 03:08:58.427
THAT EXACT NUMBER FOR YOU

03:08:58.493 --> 03:09:01.096
-- AND THEN WE HAVE HAD ON A

03:09:01.163 --> 03:09:03.198
COUPLE OF I WOULD SAY ONLY A

03:09:03.265 --> 03:09:05.367
HANDFUL OF SITUATIONS WHERE WE

03:09:05.434 --> 03:09:07.035
HAVE HAD TO I WOULD SAY AGAIN I

03:09:07.102 --> 03:09:08.203
THINK IT WAS ONLY TWO OR THREE

03:09:08.270 --> 03:09:10.172
TIMES THAT WE ACTUALLY ENTERED

03:09:10.238 --> 03:09:12.808
INTO A PARTNERSHIP LET'S SAY

03:09:12.874 --> 03:09:14.676
WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER

03:09:14.743 --> 03:09:16.445
TO DO AND EVACUATION OR D.

03:09:16.511 --> 03:09:17.512
COMPRESSION IN THOSE

03:09:17.579 --> 03:09:19.681
SITUATIONS I WAS SKILLED

03:09:19.748 --> 03:09:22.084
NURSING FACILITY S.

03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:25.187
OR THE NUMBERS SINCE MARCH HAVE

03:09:25.253 --> 03:09:28.523
THE NUMBERS OF OF LOCATIONS

03:09:28.590 --> 03:09:31.159
THAT YOU'D NEED TO TAKE ANY

03:09:31.226 --> 03:09:34.329
STEPS WITH I COMPETING LEADING

03:09:34.396 --> 03:09:35.797
LEADING UP TO POTENTIAL

03:09:35.864 --> 03:09:39.534
REPLICATION -- HAS THIS HAS

03:09:39.601 --> 03:09:41.169
HAS IT BEEN THE SAME THIS YEAR

03:09:41.236 --> 03:09:43.105
AS IN ANY OTHER YEAR OR HAS

03:09:43.171 --> 03:09:44.773
THERE BEEN A INCREASE IN THE

03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:49.578
NUMBER OF SO THAT IS THAT'S AN

03:09:49.644 --> 03:09:51.680
INCREASE IT'S IT'S UNUSUAL THAT

03:09:51.747 --> 03:09:53.181
YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET

03:09:53.248 --> 03:09:55.550
TO THE POINT OF REPLICATING IT

03:09:55.617 --> 03:09:57.552
LICENSE IN FACT I DON'T THINK

03:09:57.619 --> 03:09:59.054
IT HAS BEEN DONE WHEN I ASKED

03:09:59.121 --> 03:10:00.355
MY TEAM WHEN IS THE LAST TIME

03:10:00.422 --> 03:10:01.990
THAT THIS KIND OF STANCE HAD

03:10:02.057 --> 03:10:04.292
BEEN DONE IT HADN'T BEEN DONE

03:10:04.359 --> 03:10:06.027
IN YEARS NOT EVEN FROM I THINK

03:10:06.094 --> 03:10:07.295
MY PREDECESSOR BUT MAYBE THE

03:10:07.362 --> 03:10:09.097
PERSON BEFORE THAT -- SO IT

03:10:09.164 --> 03:10:11.533
WAS A VERY UNUSUALLY -- I GUESS

03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:13.135
STRICT COURSE OF ACTION THAT

03:10:13.201 --> 03:10:15.003
WE TOOK BUT I STAND BY THAT IT

03:10:15.070 --> 03:10:16.838
WAS THE SAFEST COURSE OF ACTION

03:10:16.905 --> 03:10:18.173
AND IT WAS ONE THAT WE ALSO

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:19.374
WERE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:10:19.441 --> 03:10:20.575
WE'RE ABLE TO TRANSFER THOSE

03:10:20.642 --> 03:10:22.210
RESIDENTS SAFELY OVER A PERIOD

03:10:22.277 --> 03:10:25.213
OF TIME -- AND -- SO WE WILL GO

03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:26.782
THROUGH THAT THAT ENFORCEMENT

03:10:26.848 --> 03:10:28.550
PROCESS AND AND SEE THIRD SEE

03:10:28.617 --> 03:10:30.952
THAT THROUGH THE ENTIRE -- A

03:10:31.019 --> 03:10:33.221
COURT PROCESS THAT THAT TAKES

03:10:33.288 --> 03:10:36.258
WAIT WAIT DO THE CLIENTS OF

03:10:36.324 --> 03:10:38.093
A REVOKED PLACE OR SHUT DOWN

03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:41.730
PLACE END UP GOING THEY ARE

03:10:41.797 --> 03:10:44.432
TRANSFERRED IT TO LOCAL --

03:10:44.499 --> 03:10:46.535
FACILITIES -- AND WE WORK WITH

03:10:46.601 --> 03:10:48.203
THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER

03:10:48.270 --> 03:10:49.471
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

03:10:49.538 --> 03:10:50.939
SAFE SPACES PARTICULARLY WITH

03:10:51.006 --> 03:10:52.307
COPE IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT

03:10:52.374 --> 03:10:53.241
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE

03:10:53.308 --> 03:10:54.609
SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE CALL

03:10:54.676 --> 03:10:56.111
THE POSITIVES THAT YOU WERE

03:10:56.178 --> 03:10:57.479
TRANSFERRED TO A LOCATION THAT

03:10:57.546 --> 03:10:59.047
ALREADY HAS A COVERT POSITIVE

03:10:59.114 --> 03:11:00.582
WING OR WHAT COLOR RED ZONE

03:11:00.649 --> 03:11:02.083
ALREADY ENACTED IN CO CORK IT

03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:04.052
APPROPRIATELY -- AND THEN IT

03:11:04.119 --> 03:11:05.220
YOU'RE MAKING SURE THAT YOU

03:11:05.287 --> 03:11:07.222
CAST INTO MEDICAL EVALUATIONS

03:11:07.289 --> 03:11:08.256
TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE THAT

03:11:08.323 --> 03:11:09.457
NEEDS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO

03:11:09.524 --> 03:11:10.659
A LOCAL GENERAL ACUTE CARE

03:11:10.725 --> 03:11:12.260
HOSPITAL AND THEN YOU'RE ALSO

03:11:12.327 --> 03:11:13.728
DOING EVALUATIONS IN TESTING

03:11:13.795 --> 03:11:14.696
TO SEE IF FOR THOSE WHO ARE

03:11:14.763 --> 03:11:17.399
COPING -- NEGATIVES I HAVE

03:11:17.465 --> 03:11:19.534
NO EXPOSURES CAN THAT BE --

03:11:19.601 --> 03:11:21.503
APPROPRIATELY TRANSFERRED --

03:11:21.570 --> 03:11:22.838
AND IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO I

03:11:22.904 --> 03:11:24.472
MEAN OF COURSE OUR OUR FIRST

03:11:24.539 --> 03:11:25.774
COURSE OF ACTION IS ALWAYS TO

03:11:25.841 --> 03:11:28.109
TRY TO -- WHAT WE CALLED YOU

03:11:28.176 --> 03:11:30.245
KNOW ENFORCE AND ENSURE THAT

03:11:30.312 --> 03:11:31.746
THERE IS IT THERE IS SAFETY AT

03:11:31.813 --> 03:11:34.382
THE LOCATION -- BUT IF IT IS

03:11:34.449 --> 03:11:36.384
SO UNSAFE WE MUST BE ABLE TO

03:11:36.451 --> 03:11:37.552
HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TRANSFER

03:11:37.619 --> 03:11:40.622
PLAN -- WITH A LOCAL OFFICER

03:11:41.156 --> 03:11:42.457
BUT HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH

03:11:42.524 --> 03:11:44.693
THAT CAPACITY ISSUES IF THE

03:11:44.759 --> 03:11:46.494
OTHER FACILITIES IN THE AREA

03:11:46.561 --> 03:11:48.330
ARE ALREADY AT CAPACITY HOW

03:11:48.396 --> 03:11:51.233
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE

03:11:51.299 --> 03:11:55.570
NEW INDIVIDUALS -- IN IN IN

03:11:55.637 --> 03:11:58.073
INTO INTO INTO THE CARE OF

03:11:58.139 --> 03:12:00.709
THE ADJOINING FACILITIES SO

03:12:00.775 --> 03:12:02.210
LUCKILY WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT

03:12:02.277 --> 03:12:03.879
ISSUE THERE IS CAPACITY AND

03:12:03.945 --> 03:12:05.881
THERE HAS BEEN CAPACITY IN ALL

03:12:05.947 --> 03:12:07.849
OF THESE SITUATIONS -- AND IN

03:12:07.916 --> 03:12:10.619
FACT WITH THE CASE OF PASADENA

03:12:10.685 --> 03:12:12.821
-- THEY HAVE I'VE ALSO WORKED

03:12:12.888 --> 03:12:14.089
WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

03:12:14.155 --> 03:12:15.323
THERE ARE PASADENA MULTIPLE

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:19.027
TIMES -- AND DOCTOR AND GO

03:12:19.094 --> 03:12:20.462
HAS EXPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE

03:12:20.528 --> 03:12:21.830
THEY HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY TO

03:12:21.897 --> 03:12:23.498
WHERE THEY DO NOT NEED THIS

03:12:23.565 --> 03:12:24.833
PARTICULAR FACILITY TO COME

03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:26.968
ONLINE AGAIN AND IT WAS IN A

03:12:27.035 --> 03:12:28.336
STATE I THINK EVEN JUST THE

03:12:28.403 --> 03:12:30.805
PHYSICAL -- AGE OF THE FACILITY

03:12:30.872 --> 03:12:33.875
AND THE -- -- HOW IT WAS SET

03:12:33.942 --> 03:12:35.877
UP IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

03:12:35.944 --> 03:12:37.979
WOULD ENTERTAIN HAVING -- A NEW

03:12:38.046 --> 03:12:39.915
OPERATIONS AND AT THIS TIME IN

03:12:39.981 --> 03:12:41.249
THE EXACT THE WAY THAT THEY GOT

03:12:41.316 --> 03:12:43.852
ACTUAL FACILITY SET UP TODAY

03:12:43.919 --> 03:12:45.754
ISRAEL IS THE TO THE PASADENA

03:12:45.820 --> 03:12:48.223
LOCATION NOW SHUT DOWN OR OF

03:12:48.290 --> 03:12:49.057
WHILE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE

03:12:49.124 --> 03:12:50.692
COURT PROCESS CAN THEY STILL

03:12:50.759 --> 03:12:52.661
OPERATE YEAH IT'S COMPLETELY

03:12:52.727 --> 03:12:54.796
SHUT DOWN AND ALL OF THAT

03:12:54.863 --> 03:12:56.865
RESIDENTS ARE AT OTHER NEARBY

03:12:56.932 --> 03:13:00.669
FACILITIES WITHIN PASADENA OKAY

03:13:01.136 --> 03:13:02.804
I I I AT LEAST SINCE THAT'S

03:13:02.871 --> 03:13:05.106
THE PASADENA IS IN AND URBAN

03:13:05.173 --> 03:13:08.176
DENSE AREA I I SUSPECT THAT THE

03:13:08.243 --> 03:13:10.111
FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES WERE

03:13:10.178 --> 03:13:11.980
WORKING WITH WITH MAYBE THE

03:13:12.047 --> 03:13:14.349
STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR

03:13:14.416 --> 03:13:16.584
LOVED ONES ARE GETTING TO A

03:13:16.651 --> 03:13:18.820
NEARBY LOCATION SO THEY ALWAYS

03:13:18.887 --> 03:13:20.255
DID IT JUST RAISES A LOT OF

03:13:20.322 --> 03:13:24.092
OTHER ISSUES -- WHAT ARE THE

03:13:24.159 --> 03:13:27.128
CURRENT TESTING PROTOCOLS FOR

03:13:27.195 --> 03:13:29.197
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LEAVING

03:13:29.731 --> 03:13:33.802
SKILLED NURSING SO LEAVING TO

03:13:34.235 --> 03:13:40.175
GO HOME OR YES SO IF A PATIENT

03:13:40.241 --> 03:13:41.743
HAS THE RIGHT OR RESIDENT HAS

03:13:41.810 --> 03:13:43.478
THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO JUST

03:13:43.545 --> 03:13:46.648
CHARGE -- AND SO WE DO NOT HAVE

03:13:46.715 --> 03:13:48.683
YOU KNOW SPECIFIC RULES ABOUT

03:13:48.750 --> 03:13:49.851
I AM TESTING IF THEY WANT TO

03:13:49.918 --> 03:13:51.753
DISCHARGED TO GO HOME YOU MEAN

03:13:51.820 --> 03:13:52.554
MEANING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:55.090
ACTUALLY STAY HOME NOT TAKE A

03:13:55.156 --> 03:13:57.492
PASCO HOME FOR A TIME PERIOD

03:13:57.559 --> 03:14:00.829
AND THEN COME BACK BUT WELL

03:14:01.062 --> 03:14:03.031
IN I WAS THINKING IN JUST AND

03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:05.900
GOING HOME PERMANENTLY BUT BUT

03:14:05.967 --> 03:14:08.169
BEING DISCHARGED BUT IN EITHER

03:14:08.236 --> 03:14:10.338
CIRCUMSTANCE I JUST I'M I'M

03:14:10.405 --> 03:14:11.573
WONDERING IS THERE SOME KIND

03:14:11.639 --> 03:14:16.211
OF A -- WHETHER AN INTRODUCTION

03:14:16.277 --> 03:14:18.046
OR EXIT OUT OF THE BILL OUT OF

03:14:18.113 --> 03:14:20.782
THE CONTAINMENT OF THE BUILDING

03:14:20.982 --> 03:14:22.650
IS THERE IS THERE TESTING THAT

03:14:22.717 --> 03:14:24.986
GETS DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:14:25.053 --> 03:14:28.256
KNOW WHAT STATE THE INDIVIDUAL

03:14:28.323 --> 03:14:30.558
IS LEAVING IN SOME MOST COMMON

03:14:30.625 --> 03:14:31.993
EXAMPLE THAT WE HAVE WHERE IT

03:14:32.060 --> 03:14:33.728
RESIDENT IS LEAVING TEMPORARILY

03:14:33.795 --> 03:14:35.096
IN COMING BACK IS USUALLY WHEN

03:14:35.163 --> 03:14:36.131
THEY'RE GOING TO A GENERAL

03:14:36.197 --> 03:14:38.533
ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL FOR -- AN

03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:40.568
ACUTE EPISODE OF SOME SORT OF

03:14:40.635 --> 03:14:42.237
ISSUE AND THEN THE RE ADMITTED

03:14:42.303 --> 03:14:44.205
BACK INTO THEIR SKILLED NURSING

03:14:44.272 --> 03:14:45.240
FACILITY WHICH IS OFTEN THEIR

03:14:45.306 --> 03:14:47.709
HOME SO TO SPEAK -- AND SO

03:14:47.776 --> 03:14:49.577
FOR THAT WE DO NOT REQUIRE TWO

03:14:49.644 --> 03:14:50.812
SETS OF TESTS WE WOULD JUST

03:14:50.879 --> 03:14:53.948
REQUIRE ONE TEST SO THAT THEY

03:14:54.015 --> 03:14:55.383
WILL HAVE THE RESULTS SO THAT

03:14:55.450 --> 03:14:57.719
THEY KNOW WHERE TO CALL COURTS

03:14:57.786 --> 03:14:59.220
THAT INDIVIDUAL SO IF THEIR

03:14:59.287 --> 03:15:00.889
TEST POSITIVE THEN THEY CAN

03:15:00.955 --> 03:15:02.357
GO INTO THE COVERT POSITIVE

03:15:02.424 --> 03:15:04.459
COMPORTED WING OF THE FACILITY

03:15:04.526 --> 03:15:07.295
IF THEY ARE -- CONSIDERED A

03:15:07.362 --> 03:15:09.764
EXPOSURE FOR SOME REASON FOR

03:15:09.831 --> 03:15:10.899
IT THAT THEY CAN GO INTO THE

03:15:10.965 --> 03:15:11.900
YELLOW AND TALKING ABOUT A

03:15:11.966 --> 03:15:13.334
QUARANTINE TYPE WHEN THEY'RE

03:15:13.401 --> 03:15:15.403
INTO THE FACILITY -- AND THEN

03:15:15.470 --> 03:15:17.939
IF IT WAS -- TESTED NEGATIVE

03:15:18.006 --> 03:15:19.207
-- THEN THERE'S POTENTIAL THAT

03:15:19.274 --> 03:15:20.141
THEY COULD GO INTO THE COOK

03:15:20.208 --> 03:15:22.977
THE GREENS OUT OF THE FACILITY

03:15:23.044 --> 03:15:23.912
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY

03:15:23.978 --> 03:15:25.747
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE SOMEONE A

03:15:25.814 --> 03:15:27.248
RESIDENT WAS LEAVING AND GOING

03:15:27.315 --> 03:15:31.319
HOME -- AND AND POTENTIALLY

03:15:31.386 --> 03:15:35.390
BENT AND MAY HAVE BEEN INFECTED

03:15:35.457 --> 03:15:38.893
AND IT WAS FOUND OUT LATER NOT

03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:40.295
IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY

03:15:40.361 --> 03:15:42.130
NOW I KNOW THAT WE SEE A LOT

03:15:42.197 --> 03:15:43.131
OF THAT AND I'VE HEARD SOME

03:15:43.198 --> 03:15:45.366
OF THOSE ISSUES MORE SO IN ON

03:15:45.433 --> 03:15:47.335
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

03:15:47.402 --> 03:15:48.736
-- BUILDINGS WHICH ARE RESIDENT

03:15:48.803 --> 03:15:51.072
CARE FOR THE ELDERLY ARSIA FEES

03:15:51.139 --> 03:15:52.740
AS WELL AS ASSISTED LIVING IN

03:15:52.807 --> 03:15:54.175
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES YOU

03:15:54.242 --> 03:15:56.111
OFTEN SEE MORE PEOPLE -- OF

03:15:56.177 --> 03:15:57.612
COURSE AND HAVING THE FREEDOM

03:15:57.679 --> 03:16:00.148
TO KIND OF GO IN AND OUT ON

03:16:00.215 --> 03:16:01.649
ITS LAST SO THAT YOU WOULD

03:16:01.716 --> 03:16:03.151
SEE THAT IN A SKILLED NURSING

03:16:03.218 --> 03:16:04.385
FACILITY BUT THE RESIDENTS

03:16:04.452 --> 03:16:05.854
ARE ARE MORE IN THE ACUTE

03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:08.123
RANGE OF -- OF ILLNESS AND

03:16:08.189 --> 03:16:10.091
AND USUALLY NOT -- YOU KNOW

03:16:10.158 --> 03:16:12.961
LEAVING OR GOING HOME BUT TO

03:16:13.027 --> 03:16:14.929
THAT POINT AS WE ARE GEARING UP

03:16:14.996 --> 03:16:17.232
AND PREPARING FOR AND HOLIDAY

03:16:17.298 --> 03:16:18.900
SEASON AND A SEASON WHERE WE

03:16:18.967 --> 03:16:21.636
DO TEND TO SEE -- POTENTIAL

03:16:21.703 --> 03:16:24.239
-- PASSES OR FOR AND SKILLED

03:16:24.305 --> 03:16:26.207
NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS TO

03:16:26.274 --> 03:16:27.709
GO HOME FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT

03:16:27.775 --> 03:16:30.311
OF TIME A WE WILL BE AN ISSUE

03:16:30.378 --> 03:16:31.713
IN ALL FACILITIES LETTER IN

03:16:31.779 --> 03:16:32.780
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THAT WE'VE

03:16:32.847 --> 03:16:34.149
BEEN DRAFTING PRESENTLY WITH

03:16:34.215 --> 03:16:35.850
OUR INFECTIOUS DISEASE TALKS

03:16:35.917 --> 03:16:37.051
ABOUT WHAT ARE SOME BEST

03:16:37.118 --> 03:16:39.287
PRACTICES ABOUT WHAT COULD BE

03:16:39.354 --> 03:16:40.955
A POTENTIAL WHEN THEY COME HOME

03:16:41.022 --> 03:16:42.290
OR IF THEY COME BACK TO THE

03:16:42.357 --> 03:16:43.691
SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IF

03:16:43.758 --> 03:16:45.460
THEY HAVE A SOME SORT OF PASS

03:16:45.527 --> 03:16:47.462
THAT GO IT THEY GO OFF ON HOW

03:16:47.529 --> 03:16:49.564
TO BEST AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY

03:16:49.631 --> 03:16:51.599
ARE LIMITING THAT EXPOSURE TO

03:16:51.666 --> 03:16:54.802
OTHERS IN THE RESIDENTS K.

03:16:54.869 --> 03:16:56.571
CHANGING CHANGING DIRECTION

03:16:56.638 --> 03:16:57.939
LITTLE BIT BACK TO THE

THE ABILITY TO REASSESS OR

REVOKE -- IF WE STILL LIKE THE

03:17:20.428 --> 03:17:22.230
SITUATION WAS ABUSED OR NOT

ARE YOU ASK IS THAT ONE OF THE

03:19:57.285 --> 03:19:58.753
FACTORS IN THE QUESTIONS THAT

03:20:05.727 --> 03:20:09.564
CERTAIN LEVEL OF OF -- OF OF

03:20:09.630 --> 03:20:11.833
CARE THAT WE'RE ESTABLISHING

03:20:11.899 --> 03:20:14.769
STANDARDS FOR WE DO ASK FOR

THEM TO ROVIRA NARRATIVE AND

03:20:16.471 --> 03:20:18.740
EXPLAIN EXPLANATION OF WHAT

03:20:18.806 --> 03:20:20.341
METHODS -- THEY HAVE ALREADY

03:20:20.408 --> 03:20:22.810
TRIED ON WHETHER THAT IS WHAT

03:20:22.877 --> 03:20:24.879
KIND OF MARKETING A RECRUITMENT

03:20:24.946 --> 03:20:27.815
HAVE THEY DONE -- WHAT IS THERE

03:20:27.882 --> 03:20:29.317
YOU KNOW CURRENT GAP THEIR PAY

03:20:29.384 --> 03:20:30.451
STRUCTURE YOU KNOW SO THAT WE

03:20:30.518 --> 03:20:31.786
CAN KIND OF GET A SENSE IS THAT

03:20:31.853 --> 03:20:33.521
BELOW MARKET IS THAT OUT MARKET

03:20:33.588 --> 03:20:36.691
IS ABOVE MARKET -- AND WE ASK

03:20:36.758 --> 03:20:39.160
FOR YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER TYPES

03:20:39.227 --> 03:20:40.828
OF AGENCIES HAVE THEY TRIED

03:20:40.895 --> 03:20:42.029
IT THEY TRIED OUTSIDE OF THEIR

03:20:42.096 --> 03:20:44.766
REGION -- IF THEY'RE RURAL AREA

03:20:44.832 --> 03:20:46.567
-- AND WE ASK FOR THAT IN THAT

03:20:46.634 --> 03:20:48.269
PROCESS WE ALSO ASK IF THERE

03:20:48.336 --> 03:20:50.638
HAD BEEN ANY RECENT LAYOFFS

03:20:50.705 --> 03:20:53.574
-- AND ANYTHING -- THAT MIGHT

03:20:53.641 --> 03:20:55.610
WARRANTS THAT THERE WAS SOME

03:20:55.676 --> 03:20:56.778
INDICATIVE REASON THAT THEY

03:20:56.844 --> 03:20:59.847
THEY COULD HAVE HAD MORE STAFF

03:21:00.748 --> 03:21:03.084
HAVE YOU NOTICED IF -- IF A

03:21:03.151 --> 03:21:05.286
FACILITY IS PAYING HAZARD PAY

03:21:05.353 --> 03:21:08.689
OR INCREASED PAY -- DO THEY

03:21:08.756 --> 03:21:10.124
FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF

03:21:10.191 --> 03:21:13.027
COMING TO YOU FOR WAIVERS YEAH

03:21:13.094 --> 03:21:14.295
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN

03:21:14.362 --> 03:21:15.229
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE

03:21:15.296 --> 03:21:16.431
WE COULD SEE IF WE COULD GET

03:21:16.497 --> 03:21:19.700
DATA ON THE DATA FRONT IT --

03:21:19.767 --> 03:21:21.869
INDUSTRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS

03:21:21.936 --> 03:21:25.473
DOING THE -- THE HAZARD PAY

03:21:25.540 --> 03:21:26.574
BECAUSE THAT I DON'T HAVE A

03:21:26.641 --> 03:21:27.942
WHOLE SONG TO BE ABLE TO IT

03:21:28.009 --> 03:21:29.510
OR EVEN A WAY TO GATHER THAT

03:21:29.577 --> 03:21:31.179
DATA BUT WE CAN SEE IF WE CAN

03:21:31.245 --> 03:21:32.380
TAKE THAT BACK BECAUSE I THINK

03:21:32.447 --> 03:21:33.281
THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING

03:21:33.347 --> 03:21:35.082
CORRELATION TO SEE IF IT'S IF

03:21:35.149 --> 03:21:37.118

03:21:37.185 --> 03:21:39.520

INTERESTED TO SEE IF THERE'S A

03:23:07.575 --> 03:23:11.112
CORRELATION BETWEEN COMPANIES

SUSPECT -- A LOT OF FOLKS WHO

03:23:29.897 --> 03:23:32.600
ARE GOING TO BE GETTING PAID

03:23:32.667 --> 03:23:33.100

INDICATED THAT THEY PAYING

03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:57.658
SUBSTANTIALLY THEY'RE PAYING

03:23:57.725 --> 03:23:59.060
MUCH HIGHER WAGES THE PAYING

03:23:59.126 --> 03:24:00.795
THEIR ALSO PAYING HAZARD PAY

03:24:00.861 --> 03:24:02.530
AND THEY WILL GET US SOME DAYS

THEY WILL JUST GET A NUMBER OF

03:24:03.998 --> 03:24:05.933
UP UP STAFF WILL JUST CALL IN

03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:08.069

COME IN FOR IT FOR DIFFERENT

03:24:09.136 --> 03:24:10.638
REASONS THAT PART OF THAT IS

03:24:10.705 --> 03:24:11.672
THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT FOR

03:24:11.739 --> 03:24:13.641
THE STAFF TO DEAL WITH TO --

03:24:13.708 --> 03:24:15.009
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S KIDS ARE

03:24:15.076 --> 03:24:16.877
DOING REMOTE SCHOOLING I MEAN

03:24:16.944 --> 03:24:18.112
IF THEY HAVE FAMILY KNOWS ALL

03:24:18.179 --> 03:24:19.614
THOSE THINGS ARE ARE DIFFICULT

03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:21.515
ISSUES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE

03:24:21.582 --> 03:24:22.683
AND WITH THE SHORTAGE WE HAVE

03:24:22.750 --> 03:24:23.985
IN WORKFORCE GENERALLY THIS IS

03:24:24.051 --> 03:24:27.054
JUST DOUBLE DOWN ON THE PROBLEM

03:24:27.488 --> 03:24:28.422
I HAVE TO ASK FOR A HALL

03:24:28.489 --> 03:24:29.590
PASS FOR MY WIFE ON MANY

03:24:29.657 --> 03:24:31.926
OCCASIONS I I THAT I UNDERSTAND

03:24:31.993 --> 03:24:35.196
I I -- WOULD THAT WOULD

03:24:35.262 --> 03:24:37.398
THE DOCTORS HERRINGTON AND

03:24:37.465 --> 03:24:39.300
WASSERMAN WANT TO OFFER

03:24:39.367 --> 03:24:41.869
SOME THOUGHTS ON ON THIS

03:25:23.077 --> 03:25:27.248
GOOD YEAH I I DEFINITELY AM YOU

03:25:27.314 --> 03:25:30.818
KNOW THIS GOES TO THE ISSUE OF

03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:36.457
HOW HOW WE KEEP AND MAINTAIN C.

03:25:36.524 --> 03:25:37.024
N.

03:25:37.091 --> 03:25:39.193
A.'S IN OUR NURSING HOMES

03:25:39.260 --> 03:25:40.361
AND THERE'S A BIT OF A FALSE

03:25:40.428 --> 03:25:42.096
NARRATIVE OUT THERE THAT IT'S

03:25:42.163 --> 03:25:43.998
HARD TO GET GOOD PEOPLE IT'S

03:25:44.065 --> 03:25:46.233
HARD TO KEEP THEM OKAY BEEN

03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:48.436
DOING THIS FOR THIRTY YEARS

03:25:48.502 --> 03:25:50.671
IF YOU FIND REALLY TOP NOTCH

03:25:50.738 --> 03:25:53.274
FACILITIES FIVE STAR FACILITIES

03:25:53.808 --> 03:25:56.177
-- VERY SUCCESSFUL FACILITIES

03:25:56.410 --> 03:25:57.578
YOU OFTEN FIND C.

03:25:57.645 --> 03:25:58.145
N.

03:25:58.212 --> 03:25:58.746
A.'S WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING

03:25:58.813 --> 03:26:01.315
THERE TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS

03:26:01.916 --> 03:26:05.086
SO HERE'S THE DEAL IT'S IT'S

03:26:05.152 --> 03:26:07.188
ABOUT IT'S ABOUT LEADERSHIP

03:26:07.254 --> 03:26:09.090
IT'S ABOUT RESPECT SO IF YOU

03:26:09.156 --> 03:26:10.491
HAVE THE RIGHT CULTURE IN YOUR

03:26:10.558 --> 03:26:12.393
FACILITY AND YOUR C.

03:26:12.460 --> 03:26:12.927
N.

03:26:12.993 --> 03:26:14.795
A.'S FEEL RESPECTED AND

03:26:14.862 --> 03:26:17.231
ACKNOWLEDGED AND CARED FOR AND

03:26:17.298 --> 03:26:18.232
THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT

03:26:18.299 --> 03:26:21.936
IS YOU'VE GOT TO PAY THEM A

03:26:22.002 --> 03:26:23.471
LIVING WAGE IF IF THEY HAVE TO

03:26:23.537 --> 03:26:24.739
WORK TWO JOBS IT'S GOING TO BE

03:26:24.805 --> 03:26:27.408
REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO BE THAT

03:26:27.475 --> 03:26:29.577
COMMITTED TO YOUR FACILITY SO

03:26:29.643 --> 03:26:31.946
I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF

03:26:32.012 --> 03:26:35.249
ADEQUATE WAGES AS WELL AS --

03:26:36.083 --> 03:26:38.319
RESPECT AND STRONG LEADERSHIP

03:26:38.519 --> 03:26:40.087
FROM THE FACILITY IN TERMS

03:26:40.154 --> 03:26:43.491
OF ABSOLUTELY RESPECTING AND

03:26:43.924 --> 03:26:46.327
APPRECIATING THE CNA'S SO I

03:26:46.393 --> 03:26:48.062
I THINK YOU KNOW PART OF THE

03:26:48.129 --> 03:26:49.764
FEMALE HERE WHEN IT COMES TO C.

03:26:49.830 --> 03:26:50.397
N.

03:26:50.464 --> 03:26:52.399
A.'S IS WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK

03:26:52.466 --> 03:26:54.235
TO DO THIS IS NOT SOMEWHERE

03:26:54.301 --> 03:26:55.503
WHERE WE JUST SAY OKAY LET'S

03:26:55.569 --> 03:26:57.304
GIVEN HAZARD PAY AND NOW

03:26:57.371 --> 03:26:58.973
THEY'RE GONNA COME AND IF

03:26:59.039 --> 03:27:00.574
THEY'RE NOT TREATED WELL THEN

03:27:00.641 --> 03:27:01.776
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME AND

03:27:01.842 --> 03:27:03.811
AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT

03:27:03.878 --> 03:27:06.280
THAT THERE IS ANY NECESSARY --

03:27:06.347 --> 03:27:07.748
ACROSS THE BOARD GENERALIZATION

03:27:07.815 --> 03:27:08.949
OF SHE AND IS NOT BEING TREATED

03:27:09.016 --> 03:27:11.385
WELL WHAT I AM SAYING IS THIS

03:27:11.452 --> 03:27:12.453
IS SOMETHING THE INDUSTRY

03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:14.989
REALLY NEEDS TO LOOK AT AND I

03:27:15.055 --> 03:27:16.257
WOULD INDUSTRY TO DOUBLE DOWN

03:27:16.323 --> 03:27:17.758
ON EVERYTHING NICOLE HOW SAID

03:27:17.825 --> 03:27:20.261
ABOUT HOW WE TRAIN THESE FOLKS

03:27:20.327 --> 03:27:23.264
AND THEN HOW AS FACILITIES WE

03:27:23.330 --> 03:27:26.367
TREAT THESE FRONTLINE HEROES --

03:27:26.433 --> 03:27:28.602
THAT WE NEED SO SO DESPERATELY

03:27:28.669 --> 03:27:30.204
AND AND I THINK IF WE IF WE

03:27:30.271 --> 03:27:31.472
TREAT THEM WELL AND PAY THEM

03:27:31.539 --> 03:27:34.441
WELL I THINK WE WILL NOT HAVE

03:27:34.508 --> 03:27:36.977
THE STAFFING ISSUES THAT WE'RE

03:27:37.044 --> 03:27:39.814
TALKING ABOUT HERE AND ONE

03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:42.049
LAST COMMENT ON THE WAIVERS

03:27:42.116 --> 03:27:45.319
I'M TO ME I I GET THE WAIVERS

03:27:45.386 --> 03:27:47.354
FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE

03:27:47.421 --> 03:27:48.923
I DON'T GET THE WAIVERS AS A

03:27:48.989 --> 03:27:51.358
CLINICIAN WHEN YOU'RE BASICALLY

03:27:51.425 --> 03:27:53.961
SAYING WE CANNOT PROVIDE AN

03:27:54.028 --> 03:27:57.064
ADEQUATE LEVEL OF CARE FOR OUR

03:27:57.131 --> 03:27:58.799
RESIDENTS BUT WE'RE GIVING A

03:27:58.866 --> 03:28:00.968
WAIVER BECAUSE THE FACILITY

03:28:01.435 --> 03:28:04.471
HAS TROUBLE GETTING THEM I

03:28:04.538 --> 03:28:06.440
I I AS A CLINICIAN I ATE I

03:28:06.507 --> 03:28:08.509
JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

03:28:12.179 --> 03:28:14.181
RIGHT GET YOUR ANSWER

03:28:16.350 --> 03:28:18.085
THANK YOU AND AND MISSED THANK

APPRECIATE -- YOU GIVING ME THE

03:28:21.956 --> 03:28:23.324
OPPORTUNITY I'LL ONLY HAVE ONE

03:28:23.390 --> 03:28:25.059
MORE QUESTION BUT WE SEEMS LIKE

03:28:25.125 --> 03:28:29.129
A I MEANT TO TALK TO HER YEAH

03:28:36.971 --> 03:28:41.609
YES HE YES OF COULD YOU REPEAT

03:28:41.675 --> 03:28:43.210
THE QUESTION IT'S VERY HARD

03:28:43.277 --> 03:28:46.280
TO HEAR ON THIS REMOTE SYSTEM

03:28:51.485 --> 03:28:54.388
THE QUESTION THE QUESTION

03:28:54.455 --> 03:28:55.689
GENERALLY WAS AROUND THE

03:28:55.756 --> 03:28:59.860
ISSUE OF -- OF THE --

03:29:02.029 --> 03:29:04.865
-- YOU TO SHORTAGES IN STAFFING

03:29:04.932 --> 03:29:07.434
AND AND AND OFFERING WAIVERS

03:29:07.868 --> 03:29:10.938
-- AND WHETHER OR NOT WHEN

03:29:11.005 --> 03:29:15.843
YOU HEY MAKE HAZARD PAYS --

03:29:16.243 --> 03:29:17.878
AND OR INCENTIVIZE GREATER

03:29:17.945 --> 03:29:21.949
PAYS ALL RIGHT IN FACILITIES

03:29:22.016 --> 03:29:23.017
WHERE THERE ARE HAS OUR PAYS

03:29:23.083 --> 03:29:25.419
OR INCREASED PAYS TO STAFF ARE

03:29:25.486 --> 03:29:26.820
THOSE ALSO THE FACILITIES THAT

03:29:26.887 --> 03:29:30.791
THEN DO NOT REQUEST WAIVERS

03:29:31.425 --> 03:29:32.493
MY WANTED TO SEE IF THERE

03:29:32.559 --> 03:29:33.694
WAS SOME KIND OF THE INTER

03:29:33.761 --> 03:29:36.196
RELATION -- THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:29:36.263 --> 03:29:39.199
ABLE TO NOTICE OR OR TRENDS

03:29:39.266 --> 03:29:42.236
FROM THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE

03:29:42.303 --> 03:29:44.505
CAN NOTICE AND AND START SEEING

03:29:44.571 --> 03:29:47.074
WHO'S ASKING FOR WAIVERS AND

03:29:47.908 --> 03:29:49.310
IF THEY'RE ASKING FOR WAIVERS

03:29:49.376 --> 03:29:51.545
HAVE THE EXHAUSTED EVERY AVENUE

03:29:51.612 --> 03:29:54.114
WHICH IS ALSO INCENTIVIZING

03:29:54.348 --> 03:29:56.150
EMPLOYEES TO GET PAID MORE

03:29:56.216 --> 03:29:58.752
SO THAT THEY DO COME TO WORK

03:29:58.819 --> 03:30:00.955
AND -- SO THAT THAT WAS THE

03:30:01.021 --> 03:30:04.525
GIST OF IT THAT WAS THE IDEA

03:30:09.997 --> 03:30:14.501
SELECT SHOWTIME AND ASSIST ON

03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:19.006
-- YES I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY

03:30:19.073 --> 03:30:20.441
UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION

03:30:20.507 --> 03:30:23.677
BECAUSE OF THE REMOTE -- BUT

03:30:23.744 --> 03:30:26.747
GENERALLY I WANTED TO SAY THAT

03:30:27.147 --> 03:30:29.516
OF THE SHORTAGE OF WORKERS IS

03:30:29.583 --> 03:30:31.986
A FUNCTION OF TWO THINGS IN

03:30:32.052 --> 03:30:34.054
ADDITION TO SOME OF THE THINGS

03:30:34.121 --> 03:30:36.490
THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IT'S

03:30:36.557 --> 03:30:39.026
IT'S A FUNCTION OF PAY OUT

03:30:39.093 --> 03:30:40.294
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN MAKE MORE

03:30:40.361 --> 03:30:42.696
MONEY AS A JANITOR OR IN IN

03:30:42.763 --> 03:30:44.932
A FAST FOOD COMPANY WITH LESS

03:30:44.999 --> 03:30:49.203
STRESS AND LESS -- DANGER OF

03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:51.271
THEN THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO

03:30:51.338 --> 03:30:53.440
GO TO WORK FOR NURSING HOME AND

03:30:53.507 --> 03:30:56.443
SECONDLY IS THE WORKLOADS OF

03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:59.413
WE KNOW FROM OUR RESEARCH THAT

03:30:59.480 --> 03:31:01.281
NURSING ASSISTANT SHOULD ONLY

03:31:01.348 --> 03:31:04.218
HAVE A SEVEN RESIDENTS AT A

03:31:04.284 --> 03:31:06.653
MAXIMUM ON THE DAY AND EVENING

03:31:06.720 --> 03:31:08.822
SHIFT AND MAYBE TWELVE OR

03:31:08.889 --> 03:31:11.692
FIFTEEN AT NIGHT AND YET MOST

03:31:11.759 --> 03:31:13.927
NURSING HOMES AND MANY OF THEM

03:31:13.994 --> 03:31:16.964
ARE ASKING A NURSING ASSISTANTS

03:31:17.031 --> 03:31:20.334
TO HAVE TWELVE OR EVEN FIFTEEN

03:31:20.401 --> 03:31:22.469
RESIDENTS TO TAKE CARE OF SO

03:31:22.536 --> 03:31:23.971
THEY SIMPLY CAN'T GET THE WORK

03:31:24.038 --> 03:31:26.440
DONE SO IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY

03:31:26.507 --> 03:31:28.308
FRUSTRATING AND WITH THE LOW

03:31:28.375 --> 03:31:32.880
PAY OF IT IT MEANS SAID THAT'S

03:31:32.946 --> 03:31:34.648
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT CAUSES

03:31:34.715 --> 03:31:36.550
THE SHORTAGE AND THEN WHEN

03:31:36.617 --> 03:31:39.119
YOU GIVE A WAIVER IT CREATES

03:31:39.186 --> 03:31:42.589
A SPIRAL DOWN SO THESE WAIVERS

03:31:42.656 --> 03:31:44.458
HAVE BEEN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

03:31:44.992 --> 03:31:47.428
AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS

03:31:47.494 --> 03:31:50.664
OF AND ON OCTOBER NINTH AT THE

03:31:50.731 --> 03:31:53.333
WATSONVILLE POST-ACUTE CENTER

03:31:53.901 --> 03:31:55.602
-- THAT WAS OF A VERY HIGH

03:31:55.669 --> 03:31:59.440
RISK OF FACILITY AND THEY ENDED

03:31:59.506 --> 03:32:01.608
UP HAVING SIXTY ONE RESIDENTS

03:32:01.675 --> 03:32:04.912
THAT GOT INFECTED AND NINE

03:32:04.978 --> 03:32:08.115
DEATHS AND -- THAT FACILITY

03:32:08.182 --> 03:32:10.751
ONLY HAD THREE POINT FOUR HOURS

03:32:10.818 --> 03:32:12.586
PER RESIDENT DAY SO IT WAS

03:32:12.653 --> 03:32:15.355
BELOW THE STATE MINIMUM AND

03:32:15.656 --> 03:32:17.891
OF FIFTEEN MINUTES OF OUR IN

03:32:17.958 --> 03:32:20.594
TIME PER RESIDENT PER DAY AND

03:32:20.661 --> 03:32:23.063
THEY WERE GIVEN A WAIVER AND SO

03:32:23.130 --> 03:32:26.033
THEY USE SPIRAL DOWN ON THEIR

03:32:26.100 --> 03:32:28.802
STAFFING AND ENDED UP HAVING TO

03:32:28.869 --> 03:32:30.971
HAVE THE NATIONAL GUARD COME IN

03:32:31.038 --> 03:32:34.208
SO WE THANK YOU KNOW THERE HAS

03:32:34.274 --> 03:32:36.043
TO BE A WAY TO GET THE WAGES

03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:38.278
INCREASED WITH PASS THROUGH

03:32:38.779 --> 03:32:40.881
ARRANGEMENTS AND TO GET THE

03:32:40.948 --> 03:32:43.617
WORKLOAD DOWN I EVEN IF THAT

03:32:43.684 --> 03:32:46.553
HAS TO BE PHASED IN OVER TIME

03:32:46.620 --> 03:32:49.389
OF HAZARD PAY WOULD MAKE A HUGE

03:32:49.456 --> 03:32:52.059
DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW

03:32:52.126 --> 03:32:54.194
IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

03:32:54.261 --> 03:32:55.562
AND WE KNOW THAT MANY NURSING

03:32:55.629 --> 03:32:58.198
HOMES HAVE A GIVEN OUT HAZARD

03:32:58.265 --> 03:33:01.702
PAY AND THAT HAS RENAMED IT HAS

03:33:01.768 --> 03:33:03.337
MADE A DIFFERENCE ALTHOUGH WE

03:33:03.403 --> 03:33:05.038
DON'T HAVE ANY RESEARCH DATA

03:33:05.105 --> 03:33:07.808
ON IT BUT JUST ANECDOTALLY

03:33:08.375 --> 03:33:12.279
SO -- -- THIS IS IS IT'S

03:33:12.346 --> 03:33:15.549
A FUNDAMENTAL OF A PROBLEM

03:33:15.616 --> 03:33:17.651
HERE AND I THINK OF I WANT TO

03:33:17.718 --> 03:33:19.820
JUST SAY THAT I THINK A LOT

03:33:19.887 --> 03:33:22.523
OF THE DALLAS THAT WE'VE HAD

03:33:22.589 --> 03:33:25.092
THE OVER FOUR THOUSAND DEATHS

03:33:25.159 --> 03:33:27.094
COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF

03:33:27.161 --> 03:33:29.429
WE HAD ASKED NURSING HOMES TO

03:33:29.496 --> 03:33:31.498
INCREASE THERE ARE IN STAFFING

03:33:31.565 --> 03:33:34.001
AND THERE'S TOTAL STAFFING

03:33:34.067 --> 03:33:36.970
DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ASKED

03:33:37.037 --> 03:33:38.839
THEM TO REALLY INCREASE THE

03:33:38.906 --> 03:33:40.941
HAZARD PAY AND THEY OVER AT

03:33:41.008 --> 03:33:43.510
LEAST THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR

03:33:43.577 --> 03:33:45.412
MORE ON OVERALL PAY IT WOULD

03:33:45.479 --> 03:33:47.981
HAVE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE

03:33:49.816 --> 03:33:53.987
IN THE INSTANCE THAT ARE

03:33:54.054 --> 03:33:55.689
YOU SAID THE NATIONAL

03:33:55.756 --> 03:33:58.325
GUARD CAME IN TO A FACILITY

03:33:58.392 --> 03:34:00.394
WHO COVER THEIR COST

03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:10.170
I I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

03:34:10.237 --> 03:34:11.939
WHO COVER THEIR COSTS BUT I

03:34:12.005 --> 03:34:13.974
MEAN IT'S JUST A SYMPTOM OF

03:34:14.041 --> 03:34:15.475
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE

03:34:15.542 --> 03:34:18.412
LOW STAFFING AND PUT THIS

03:34:18.679 --> 03:34:20.681
OTHER NURSES IN AN UNTENABLE

03:34:20.747 --> 03:34:23.717
POSITION AND THEN -- WHEN THEY

03:34:23.784 --> 03:34:25.719
GET SICK OR THEY'RE EXPOSED

03:34:25.786 --> 03:34:27.888
TO THE COLD BED THEY'RE NOT

03:34:27.955 --> 03:34:30.824
GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK OR

03:34:30.891 --> 03:34:33.393
THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE WORK

03:34:33.660 --> 03:34:35.495
AND LEAVING THE FACILITY

03:34:35.562 --> 03:34:38.465
WITH NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE

03:34:38.865 --> 03:34:40.601
BUT BRINGING IN THE NATIONAL

03:34:40.667 --> 03:34:42.903
GUARD AND I AM NOT SURE WHO

03:34:42.970 --> 03:34:44.438
PAID FOR THEM BUT I STE I

03:34:44.504 --> 03:34:47.507
DOUBT IF THAT WAS THE FACILITY

03:34:51.144 --> 03:34:53.046
WELL IT WAS SILLY YEAH THE

03:34:53.113 --> 03:34:55.148
FACILITY IS BUILT ANY TIME THAT

03:34:55.215 --> 03:34:57.050
WE DEPLOY EMERGENCY STAFFING

03:34:57.117 --> 03:34:58.652
WHETHER THAT'S HEALTH CORE

03:34:58.719 --> 03:35:00.354
A MERCHANT SEE -- STAFFING

03:35:00.420 --> 03:35:01.588
THROUGH OUR NATIONAL GUARD

03:35:01.655 --> 03:35:02.556
OR THROUGH ACCOUNT THAT

03:35:02.623 --> 03:35:04.658
TEAMS ALL OF OUR DEPLOYMENTS

03:35:04.725 --> 03:35:05.993
FOR EMERGENCY STAFFING THE

03:35:06.059 --> 03:35:08.295
FACILITIES ARE BILLED --

03:35:08.362 --> 03:35:10.897
THAT STAFFING AND IS THAT

03:35:10.964 --> 03:35:13.467
BUILDING AT THE SAME RATE

03:35:13.834 --> 03:35:15.769
AS THE STAFF WOULD HAVE BEEN

03:35:15.836 --> 03:35:17.070
GETTING PAID OR IS THERE A

03:35:17.137 --> 03:35:19.740
DIFFERENCE GREAT QUESTION SO

03:35:19.806 --> 03:35:22.142
WE BILL AT THE STATE RATE THAT

03:35:22.209 --> 03:35:24.144
WE GET THOSE STATE CONTRACTS

03:35:24.211 --> 03:35:25.579
FOR AND WE PASSED THROUGH

03:35:25.646 --> 03:35:28.515
THAT COSTS DIRECTLY -- ENSUE

03:35:28.582 --> 03:35:29.950
I'M OFTENTIMES THE STATE

03:35:30.017 --> 03:35:31.785
CONTRACTS ARE VERY PRICEY

03:35:31.852 --> 03:35:33.887
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE -- AND SO

03:35:33.954 --> 03:35:35.889
IT IS DEFINITELY NOT -- IN A

03:35:35.956 --> 03:35:38.492
FACILITIES INTEREST TO -- HAVE

03:35:38.558 --> 03:35:40.093
EMERGENCY STAFFING AND AND THAT

03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:42.963
KIND OF BILL MISTER IS THERE

03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:44.798
CAN I JUST CONNECT MUCH SAY ONE

03:35:44.865 --> 03:35:46.066
OTHER THING JUST FOR CONTEXT

03:35:46.133 --> 03:35:46.800
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S BEEN

03:35:46.867 --> 03:35:48.835
A LOT OF GOOD TESTIMONY A LOT

03:35:48.902 --> 03:35:50.337
OF GOOD POINTS HERE I WANT TO

03:35:50.404 --> 03:35:52.272
MENTION TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE

03:35:52.339 --> 03:35:54.941
MORE STAFF IN FACILITIES COULD

03:35:55.008 --> 03:35:56.209
IT COULD WELL BE A GOOD THING

03:35:56.276 --> 03:35:57.311
THAT I DON'T WANT TO QUESTION

03:35:57.377 --> 03:35:58.378
THAT AT ALL BUT I DO WANT

03:35:58.445 --> 03:36:00.347
TO POINT OUT IF YOU LOOK AT

03:36:00.414 --> 03:36:02.015
THE HISTORY OF THIS PANDEMIC

03:36:02.082 --> 03:36:03.750
IF YOU HAVE MORE STAFF AND

03:36:03.817 --> 03:36:04.418
THEY DON'T HAVE P.

03:36:04.484 --> 03:36:04.618
P.

03:36:04.685 --> 03:36:05.218
E.

03:36:05.619 --> 03:36:08.021
AND THEY DON'T HAVE TESTING

03:36:08.088 --> 03:36:09.556
THAT YOU PROBABLY STILL GOING

03:36:09.623 --> 03:36:10.757
TO HAVE PROBLEMS AND THAT

03:36:10.824 --> 03:36:12.326
BECAUSE AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW

03:36:12.392 --> 03:36:13.760
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PANDEMIC

03:36:13.827 --> 03:36:15.095
WE'VE HAD FACILITIES THAT

03:36:15.162 --> 03:36:17.097
HAD VERY HIGH STAFFING LEVELS

03:36:17.164 --> 03:36:18.131
WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIGH

03:36:18.198 --> 03:36:19.633
STAFFING LEVELS AND STILL HAD

03:36:19.700 --> 03:36:21.168
SPREAD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE

03:36:21.234 --> 03:36:22.903
PP THEY DIDN'T HAVE TESTING

03:36:22.969 --> 03:36:24.771
AND THEY DID NOT KNOW BASED

03:36:24.838 --> 03:36:26.206
ON THE EARLY GUIDANCE EARLY

03:36:26.273 --> 03:36:27.407
GUIDANCE SAID THAT YOU HAD TO

03:36:27.474 --> 03:36:29.409
BE SYMPTOMATIC WHERE YOU PER

03:36:29.476 --> 03:36:32.045
SPREADING THAT WAS WRONG AND

03:36:32.112 --> 03:36:33.313
WE FOUND THAT OUT THAT THAT

03:36:33.380 --> 03:36:35.315
HAPPENED LATER ON IN ADDITION

03:36:35.382 --> 03:36:37.117
WHEN WE HAD -- EMISSIONS FROM

03:36:37.184 --> 03:36:39.186
HOSPITALS OF OF -- FOLKS WHO

03:36:39.252 --> 03:36:41.088
WERE ALREADY POSITIVE RESIDENTS

03:36:41.154 --> 03:36:43.190
ALREADY POSITIVE -- THAT WERE

03:36:43.256 --> 03:36:44.958
THERE WE WERE A SYMPTOMATIC

03:36:45.025 --> 03:36:46.560
THEY WERE SPREADING SO TO THE

03:36:46.626 --> 03:36:47.928
EXTENT WE HAVE MORE STAFF YEAH

03:36:47.994 --> 03:36:49.262
THAT THAT'S THAT THAT THAT

03:36:49.329 --> 03:36:50.330
COULD BE AN ADVANTAGE ON THE

03:36:50.397 --> 03:36:51.965
ONE HAND ON THE OTHER HAND WITH

03:36:52.032 --> 03:36:53.166
THE FUNDAMENTALS WE'VE SEEN

03:36:53.233 --> 03:36:54.968
IN THIS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY

03:36:55.035 --> 03:36:56.803
THE FIRST NUMBER OF MONTHS

03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:58.171
THAT WOULD PROBABLY NOT MADE

03:36:58.238 --> 03:36:59.740
ANY DIFFERENCE UNFORTUNATELY

03:37:01.408 --> 03:37:02.309
THANKFULLY WE'RE IN A BETTER

03:37:02.376 --> 03:37:03.543
SPOT THANK WROTE IN A MUCH

03:37:03.610 --> 03:37:05.379
BETTER SPOT ON PP WE KNOW

03:37:05.445 --> 03:37:06.580
MORE ABOUT THAT EVERYBODY

03:37:06.646 --> 03:37:07.948
KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE VIRUS

03:37:08.014 --> 03:37:09.316
BUT THIS IS BEEN A STATEWIDE

03:37:09.383 --> 03:37:10.517
PROBLEM FOR THE ENTIRE HEALTH

03:37:10.584 --> 03:37:12.986
CARE ANYWAY CRAIG CRAIG ALL

03:37:13.053 --> 03:37:15.555
DUE RESPECT YOUR YOUR YOUR

03:37:16.556 --> 03:37:18.024
SEEING THINGS THAT RAISES A LOT

03:37:18.091 --> 03:37:21.094
OF OTHER QUESTIONS AND AND SO

03:37:21.495 --> 03:37:22.763

KNOW EITHER BECAUSE I I HAVE

03:37:29.369 --> 03:37:30.971
JUST ONE MORE QUESTION BUT THIS

03:37:31.037 --> 03:37:32.839
IS LEADING TO A CERTAIN OTHER

03:37:32.906 --> 03:37:34.808
AREAS AS WELL I MEAN IT YOU

03:37:34.875 --> 03:37:36.376
WHAT YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING

03:37:36.443 --> 03:37:38.178
IS THAT IF YOU KNOW WE DON'T

03:37:38.245 --> 03:37:40.046
DO ONE SET OF THINGS THEN WE

03:37:40.113 --> 03:37:41.415
WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOME

03:37:41.481 --> 03:37:42.816
OTHER THINGS THAT'S WHAT I

03:37:42.883 --> 03:37:44.384
HEARD AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I

03:37:44.451 --> 03:37:46.186
HEARD I DON'T KNOW COMMITTEE

BUT YOU KNOW WE WERE HAVING

03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:52.893
STRUGGLES AS WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE

03:37:52.959 --> 03:37:54.795
OF THESE HEARINGS IN ORDER TO

03:37:54.861 --> 03:37:56.963
ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS OF

03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:58.098
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

03:37:58.165 --> 03:37:59.800
HEALTH AND WHY WE'RE NOT

03:37:59.866 --> 03:38:01.201
GETTING CERTAIN STANDARDS INTO

03:38:01.268 --> 03:38:05.238
PLACE YOU KNOW IT OUT ONCE IF

03:38:05.305 --> 03:38:07.541
WE CAN MEET THOSE WHICH WHICH

03:38:07.607 --> 03:38:08.909
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MET YET BUT

03:38:08.975 --> 03:38:10.811
AS WE'RE MAKING HEADWAY INTO

03:38:10.877 --> 03:38:12.446
MEETING SOME OF THOSE YOU

03:38:12.512 --> 03:38:15.615
KNOW -- I THERE'S A PART THAT

03:38:15.682 --> 03:38:17.017
THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO PLAY

03:38:17.083 --> 03:38:19.152
AS WELL AND MAKE SURE THAT

03:38:19.219 --> 03:38:21.521
IT'S MEETING THESE CHALLENGES

03:38:21.588 --> 03:38:24.925
AS WELL SO HELP ME OUT HERE

03:38:24.991 --> 03:38:27.027
BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT ANSWER IT

03:38:27.093 --> 03:38:28.795
RAISED MORE QUESTIONS THAN THAN

03:38:28.862 --> 03:38:30.530
WHAT I CANCER WELL I THINK YOU

03:38:30.597 --> 03:38:31.765
HEARD THE STATISTICS AT THE

03:38:31.832 --> 03:38:33.400
BEGINNING AS TO HOW MUCH BETTER

03:38:33.467 --> 03:38:35.569
WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW HOW MUCH

03:38:35.635 --> 03:38:36.703
BETTER WE'RE DOING RELATIVE

03:38:36.770 --> 03:38:37.804
IN TIME BUT HOW MUCH BETTER

03:38:37.871 --> 03:38:39.272
WE'RE DOING THAN OTHER STATES

03:38:39.339 --> 03:38:41.274
AND HAVE A THAT DOESN'T THAT

03:38:41.341 --> 03:38:42.375
DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS

03:38:42.442 --> 03:38:44.110
THE QUESTION WELL IT IT DOES

03:38:44.177 --> 03:38:45.445
I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I THINK

03:38:45.512 --> 03:38:46.646
WE DON'T HAVE THOSE VULNERABLE

03:38:46.713 --> 03:38:49.883
PEOPLE PASSED AWAY ALREADY WELL

03:38:49.950 --> 03:38:51.952
WE'VE ALREADY WE'VE ALREADY

03:38:52.619 --> 03:38:53.687
WITH THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A

03:38:53.753 --> 03:38:56.857
DISSERVICE AND AND I DID AGAIN

03:38:56.923 --> 03:38:58.692
WE WE MOURN ALL THE EVERYONE

03:38:58.758 --> 03:39:00.093
HAS PASSED AWAY IN ANY FACILITY

03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:01.228
AND AGAIN AS I TRIED TO SAY

03:39:01.294 --> 03:39:02.762
AT THE BEGINNING WE CELEBRATE

03:39:02.829 --> 03:39:03.997
THE CARE GIVERS WE HAVE HERE

03:39:04.064 --> 03:39:05.131
AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAS NOT

03:39:05.198 --> 03:39:06.633
HAPPENED ENOUGH EITHER THAT

03:39:06.700 --> 03:39:07.667
IS THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT

03:39:07.734 --> 03:39:09.002
OF FOCUS ON THE HOSPITAL CARE

03:39:09.069 --> 03:39:10.303
GIVERS AND NOT NEARLY ENOUGH

03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:11.872
FOCUS ON THAT THE CARE GIVERS

03:39:11.938 --> 03:39:13.039
AND OUR LONG TERM CARE SETTINGS

03:39:13.106 --> 03:39:14.574
AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED BUT

03:39:14.641 --> 03:39:15.876
I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN

03:39:15.942 --> 03:39:18.512
THOUGH IN THIS PANDEMIC SOME

03:39:18.578 --> 03:39:19.746
OF THE THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING

03:39:19.813 --> 03:39:22.015
ABOUT GIVEN WHAT WE WHAT WE'VE

03:39:22.082 --> 03:39:23.884
LEARNED SINCE THEN WE WE WERE

03:39:23.950 --> 03:39:25.986
PET THIS WAS A A PERFECT STORM

03:39:26.052 --> 03:39:28.021
FORCE FRANKLY WE HAD A PANDEMIC

03:39:28.088 --> 03:39:29.155
WE DIDN'T KNOW IT BUT NO ONE

03:39:29.222 --> 03:39:30.223
KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAS

03:39:30.290 --> 03:39:31.191
AFFECTING THE HEALTH CARE

03:39:31.258 --> 03:39:33.026
STRUCTURE ACROSS THE BOARD WE

03:39:33.093 --> 03:39:34.494
HAD NO PETE NOBODY HAD ANY P.

03:39:34.561 --> 03:39:35.061
P.

03:39:35.128 --> 03:39:36.196
ET AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY

03:39:36.263 --> 03:39:37.898
TESTING THOSE THINGS WERE ALL

03:39:37.964 --> 03:39:39.466
A REAL PROBLEM AND PUT EVERYONE

03:39:39.533 --> 03:39:41.101
BACK ON THEIR HEELS VERY VERY

03:39:41.167 --> 03:39:42.802
BADLY FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF

03:39:42.869 --> 03:39:44.170
MONTHS OUT THANKFULLY THINGS

03:39:44.237 --> 03:39:45.605
ARE MUCH BETTER ON THOSE FRONTS

03:39:45.672 --> 03:39:46.640
THAN THEY WERE A PARTICULAR

03:39:46.706 --> 03:39:47.908
IN THE TESTING OF THE PD IS

03:39:47.974 --> 03:39:50.544
YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY SO WHAT

03:39:50.610 --> 03:39:51.611
YOU'RE SAYING AND IT'S BETTER

03:39:51.678 --> 03:39:54.614
TO AN INCORRECT I I THINK I

03:39:54.681 --> 03:39:57.551
MUST TAKE EXCEPTION TO WHAT

03:39:57.617 --> 03:39:58.752
YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE PART

03:39:58.818 --> 03:39:59.953
OF IT IS WE'RE ALSO COMING

03:40:00.020 --> 03:40:03.690
OFF OF A WHAT ONE OF THE BEST

03:40:03.757 --> 03:40:05.258
ECONOMIC PERFORMING PERIODS

03:40:05.325 --> 03:40:07.994
OF TIME WE'VE HAD CONTINUOUS

03:40:08.328 --> 03:40:10.931
GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY SO WHEN

03:40:10.997 --> 03:40:11.831
WE'RE SEEING UP THERE WAS A

03:40:11.898 --> 03:40:13.867
PERFECT STORM YES THERE WAS A

03:40:13.934 --> 03:40:15.468
PERFECT STORM BUT THE REALITY

03:40:15.535 --> 03:40:17.337
IS THAT THE PERFECT STORM WAS

03:40:17.404 --> 03:40:20.941
PRECEDED BY NINE YEARS IF NOT

03:40:21.007 --> 03:40:23.376
MORE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND

03:40:23.443 --> 03:40:25.445
BENEFIT AND SO THAT'S THE TIME

03:40:25.512 --> 03:40:26.880
WHEN WE MAKE THE APPROPRIATE

03:40:26.947 --> 03:40:29.249
PRECAUTIONS AND INVESTMENTS

03:40:29.316 --> 03:40:31.418
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE READY

03:40:31.484 --> 03:40:33.587
FOR INSTANCES LIKE WHAT WE'VE

03:40:33.653 --> 03:40:34.921
BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE LAST

03:40:34.988 --> 03:40:36.856
SEVEN MONTHS SO THAT THAT'S

03:40:36.923 --> 03:40:38.191
THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING A BIT

03:40:38.258 --> 03:40:40.427
OF A CHALLENGE ACCEPTING THAT

03:40:40.493 --> 03:40:42.629
RESPONSE HI I COULDN'T AGREE

03:40:42.696 --> 03:40:44.230
MORE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE

03:40:44.297 --> 03:40:46.199
AND WE WERE VERY WE WERE VERY

03:40:46.266 --> 03:40:47.334
PLEASED WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN

03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:48.501
EIGHTY EIGHTY ONE THIS YEAR

03:40:48.568 --> 03:40:49.803
TO GIVE US A RATE GIVE OUR

03:40:49.869 --> 03:40:51.605
FACILITIES RATE INCREASES THEY

03:40:51.671 --> 03:40:53.907
DIDN'T COME NEARLY THEY WERE

03:40:53.974 --> 03:40:55.008
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO COVER

03:40:55.075 --> 03:40:57.544
THE COST SO EVEN WITH THE GOOD

03:40:57.611 --> 03:40:59.546
TIMES THE STATE HAD WE ARE

03:40:59.613 --> 03:41:01.281
PERSONALLY DID NOT SEE THAT AND

03:41:01.348 --> 03:41:02.515
AS AGAIN AS I SAY WE'RE BEING

03:41:02.582 --> 03:41:03.950
REIMBURSED RIGHT OUR FACILITIES

03:41:04.017 --> 03:41:05.785
BEING REIMBURSED BASED ON WHAT

03:41:05.852 --> 03:41:07.721
THEY HAD TO PAY TWO YEARS PRIOR

03:41:07.787 --> 03:41:10.323
TO TO TODAY -- AND GIVEN WHAT'S

03:41:10.390 --> 03:41:12.125
HAPPENED ON ALL COST AND THE

03:41:12.192 --> 03:41:13.860
LAST TWO YEARS THEY'RE STILL

03:41:13.927 --> 03:41:16.296
VERY FAR BEHIND SO I BUT I

03:41:16.363 --> 03:41:18.999
COULD HURT SIXTEEN KERR WITH SO

03:41:19.065 --> 03:41:20.634
I'LL JUST ASK MY LAST QUESTION

03:41:20.700 --> 03:41:21.701

ENSURING THAT OVERSIGHT ISN'T

03:41:28.508 --> 03:41:30.443
SIMPLY LOOKING AT INFECTION

03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:34.681
PROTOCOLS -- BUT IT'S ALSO

03:41:34.748 --> 03:41:36.783
ADDRESSING THE QUALITY OF LIFE

03:41:36.850 --> 03:41:38.985
INSIDE THE SKILLED NURSING

03:41:39.052 --> 03:41:41.621
FACILITY SO AND AND AND I

03:41:41.688 --> 03:41:44.290
WELCOME RESPONSES FROM MISS

03:41:44.357 --> 03:41:46.459

WELL AS -- DR WASSERMAN AS WELL

03:41:51.431 --> 03:41:52.766
WELL OFTEN WHEN WE ARE IN A

03:41:52.832 --> 03:41:54.634
FACILITIES TO WORK REQUIRED

03:41:54.701 --> 03:41:56.670
-- ASK CONTRACTORS OF CMS

03:41:56.736 --> 03:41:59.139
AND BY OUR DUTIES -- OR STATE

03:41:59.205 --> 03:42:01.141
SURVEYORS IS THAT EVEN IF WE'RE

03:42:01.207 --> 03:42:03.009
IN A FACILITY INVESTIGATING

03:42:03.076 --> 03:42:04.511
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A

03:42:04.577 --> 03:42:06.579
FLY IN THE SOUP IF WE SEE

03:42:06.646 --> 03:42:08.114
SOMETHING WHILE WE'RE IN THAT

03:42:08.181 --> 03:42:10.717
FACILITY THAT WARRANTS CONCERN

03:42:10.784 --> 03:42:12.118
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

03:42:12.185 --> 03:42:13.453
WHY WE ENTERED THE FACILITY

03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:14.854
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE HAVE

03:42:14.921 --> 03:42:16.623
THE RIGHT AND THE DUTY TO

03:42:16.690 --> 03:42:19.192
EXPLORE THAT AND TO DO A AN

03:42:19.259 --> 03:42:20.827
INVESTIGATION ON THAT SO EVEN

03:42:20.894 --> 03:42:22.262
IF WE'RE IN A FACILITY THAT

03:42:22.328 --> 03:42:23.830
IS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO AN

03:42:23.897 --> 03:42:25.131
INFECTION PREVENTION IT COULD

03:42:25.198 --> 03:42:26.266
BE A COMPLAIN TO COULD BE

03:42:26.332 --> 03:42:28.868
ANYTHING WHEN WE'RE IN THERE IF

03:42:28.935 --> 03:42:30.737
WE SEE SOMETHING THEN WE MUST

03:42:30.804 --> 03:42:31.905
FIGHT AND GO FOR IT AND I'VE

03:42:31.971 --> 03:42:33.773
HAVE IT MANY EXAMPLES OF TIMES

03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:36.142
UNFORTUNATELY WHERE WE HAVE

03:42:36.209 --> 03:42:37.644
BEEN INFORMED INFECTION CONTROL

03:42:37.711 --> 03:42:40.313
SURVEY AND WE WITNESS AND SEE

03:42:40.380 --> 03:42:41.681
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SURVEYORS

03:42:41.748 --> 03:42:42.782
THEY KNOW THESE FACILITIES

03:42:42.849 --> 03:42:43.850
THEY'VE BEEN IN THERE MULTIPLE

03:42:43.917 --> 03:42:45.385
TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND

03:42:45.452 --> 03:42:47.087
THEY SEE A RESIDENT WHO LOOKS

03:42:47.153 --> 03:42:48.988
LIKE THEY'VE LOST WEIGHT AND

03:42:49.055 --> 03:42:50.123
THEN THAT'S THE FIRST THING

03:42:50.190 --> 03:42:51.458
AN INDICATION IF THEY START TO

03:42:51.524 --> 03:42:53.026
DO A FULLER INVESTIGATION OF

03:42:53.093 --> 03:42:54.260
NUTRITION AND TO SEE IF THERE'S

03:42:54.327 --> 03:42:55.762
A QUALITY OF CARE ISSUE TO SEE

03:42:55.829 --> 03:43:00.500
IF THERE ARE MORE -- -- DEEPER

03:43:00.567 --> 03:43:01.101
ISSUES GOING ON THE FACILITY

03:43:03.536 --> 03:43:06.339

SITUATION THAT HAS NOTHING

03:43:18.551 --> 03:43:20.120
TO DO WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT

03:43:20.186 --> 03:43:21.621
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH POOR

03:43:21.688 --> 03:43:23.590

TO SEE IT BUT THE OTHER WAY

03:43:28.862 --> 03:43:30.764
IS ACTUALLY PARTNERING WITH

A DIFFERENT WAY AS WELL AND

WHAT IT HAS BEEN LIKE TO

03:45:40.827 --> 03:45:42.629
WORK DURING THE WHOLE OF IT

03:45:42.695 --> 03:45:43.830
I HAVE BEEN WELL AWARE OF

03:45:43.897 --> 03:45:45.832
THE POOR INFECTION CONTROL

03:45:45.899 --> 03:45:47.600
PRACTICES AND QUALITY OF CARE

03:45:47.667 --> 03:45:49.702
IN MANY OF OUR NURSING HOMES

03:45:49.769 --> 03:45:52.338
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THE

03:45:52.405 --> 03:45:53.773
HIGH RATES OF DEATH IN THESE

03:45:53.840 --> 03:45:55.942
FACILITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC

03:45:56.009 --> 03:45:57.510
UNFORTUNATELY COMES AS NO

03:45:57.577 --> 03:45:59.679
SURPRISE WHEN I SAW WHAT WAS

03:45:59.746 --> 03:46:01.381
HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON STATE

03:46:01.447 --> 03:46:03.483
IN FEBRUARY I KNEW WHAT WAS

03:46:03.549 --> 03:46:06.119
HEADED OUR WAY SOME CO WORKERS

03:46:06.185 --> 03:46:08.454
AND I REQUESTED AT THAT TIME

03:46:08.521 --> 03:46:10.189
THAT WE BE FIT TESTED WITH N.

03:46:10.256 --> 03:46:11.758
NINETY FIVE MASKS SO THAT WE

03:46:11.824 --> 03:46:13.726
COULD BE PREPARED TO ENTER

03:46:13.793 --> 03:46:16.062
NURSING HOMES TO ENSURE SAFETY

03:46:16.129 --> 03:46:17.830
HOWEVER IN MARCH WE WERE TOLD

03:46:17.897 --> 03:46:19.899
TO STAY OUT OF THE FACILITIES

03:46:19.966 --> 03:46:22.035
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SAFE

03:46:22.101 --> 03:46:24.070
FIT TESTING BEGAN FOR US IN

03:46:24.137 --> 03:46:27.674

THE STATE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY

03:46:31.844 --> 03:46:34.047
OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS BUT

03:46:34.113 --> 03:46:35.715
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PLANNING

03:46:35.782 --> 03:46:37.550
AND PROPER EQUIPMENT WE WERE

03:46:37.617 --> 03:46:39.419
NOT ABLE TO GO IN EARLY IN

03:46:39.485 --> 03:46:41.521
THIS PANDEMIC TO PROTECT OUR

03:46:41.587 --> 03:46:44.324
MOST VULNERABLE I BELIEVE MANY

03:46:44.390 --> 03:46:46.859
LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED

03:46:46.926 --> 03:46:48.928
IF WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO SO

03:46:48.995 --> 03:46:50.596
WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT

03:46:50.663 --> 03:46:52.365

03:48:14.080 --> 03:48:16.582

03:48:20.420 --> 03:48:21.187
I'M TRYING TO GET MY

03:48:21.254 --> 03:48:22.889

IN THE BUILDINGS AT LEAST EVERY

03:48:40.740 --> 03:48:42.542
SIX WEEKS NOW AND SOME CASES

03:48:42.608 --> 03:48:44.210
MORE CHECK ON THE MITIGATION

03:48:44.277 --> 03:48:46.579
PLANS -- AND AND SEE HOW SILLY

03:48:46.646 --> 03:48:48.514
TO DO IT AND SO IT JUST IN

03:48:48.581 --> 03:48:50.616
TERMS OF OVERSIGHT I'M NOT SURE

03:48:50.683 --> 03:48:53.186
THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT

03:49:05.331 --> 03:49:06.899
OKAY YEAH I KNOW I'M I'M GOOD

03:49:06.966 --> 03:49:09.302
I I I I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT

03:49:09.368 --> 03:49:11.871
THAT OUR BRAVE SOUL WAS WAS

03:49:11.938 --> 03:49:13.940
SHARING WITH US I'M YOU KNOW

03:49:14.006 --> 03:49:16.576
I I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT --

03:49:16.642 --> 03:49:18.678
AS OF LATE MY ORGANIZATION HAS

03:49:18.744 --> 03:49:21.914
BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH CDPH

03:49:22.181 --> 03:49:24.717
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEGUN TO DEVELOP

03:49:24.784 --> 03:49:27.286
SOME EDUCATION TRAINING FOR

03:49:27.820 --> 03:49:30.756
SURVEYORS AROUND WORKING WITH

03:49:30.823 --> 03:49:32.725
-- OR ASKING QUESTIONS OF AND

03:49:32.792 --> 03:49:35.194
-- -- INTERVIEWING THE MEDICAL

03:49:35.261 --> 03:49:37.029
DIRECTORS THE CONSULTANT

03:49:37.096 --> 03:49:39.565
PHARMACISTS -- AND SO WE

03:49:39.632 --> 03:49:41.000
ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATE

03:49:41.067 --> 03:49:43.870
THOSE EFFORTS AND WE THINK --

03:49:43.936 --> 03:49:46.139
TWO MR CHRIS POINT THAT ONE OF

03:49:46.205 --> 03:49:48.207
THE CHALLENGES OF THE SURVEY

03:49:48.274 --> 03:49:52.712
PROCESS IS HOW YOU IMPACT FOR

03:49:52.778 --> 03:49:55.982
LEADERSHIP IN A FACILITY AND

03:49:56.048 --> 03:49:58.050
AND I THINK YOU BEGIN TO IMPACT

03:49:58.117 --> 03:50:00.720
OUT BY ASKING MORE QUESTIONS OF

03:50:00.786 --> 03:50:02.388
ALL THE LEADERS IN THE FACILITY

03:50:02.455 --> 03:50:03.489
ADMINISTRATOR THE DIRECTOR

03:50:03.556 --> 03:50:05.091
OF NURSING THE THE MEDICAL

03:50:05.158 --> 03:50:06.225
DIRECTOR OF THE CONSULTANT

03:50:06.292 --> 03:50:09.428
PHARMACIST AND SUCH SO OKAY

03:50:09.495 --> 03:50:12.498
I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT WE

03:50:12.565 --> 03:50:14.700
CAN LEARN FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED

03:50:14.767 --> 03:50:17.036
OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS I

03:50:17.103 --> 03:50:18.738
I THINK THERE'S BEEN POSITIVE

03:50:18.804 --> 03:50:22.108
MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF LOOKING

03:50:22.175 --> 03:50:23.609
AT HOW WE APPROACH THESE

03:50:23.676 --> 03:50:25.678
PROCESSES I ABSOLUTELY AGREE

03:50:25.745 --> 03:50:29.048
THAT -- WE NEED TO CONTINUE

03:50:29.415 --> 03:50:31.851
DOWN THAT PATH AND YOU KNOW WE

03:50:31.918 --> 03:50:33.352
CAN WE CAN FIND FAULT IN WHAT

03:50:33.419 --> 03:50:34.587
WE'VE DONE WRONG BUT I THINK

03:50:34.654 --> 03:50:36.956
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS START

03:50:37.023 --> 03:50:38.324
FIGURING OUT WHAT WE WHAT'S

03:50:38.391 --> 03:50:41.327
NEXT IN AND I I I WILL SURE --

03:50:41.394 --> 03:50:43.196
CAL TCM IS ACTUALLY SUBMITTED

03:50:43.262 --> 03:50:44.931
A GRANT PROPOSAL THROUGH THE

03:50:44.997 --> 03:50:47.500
CMP FUNDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP

03:50:47.567 --> 03:50:49.735
AND MANAGEMENT TRAINING TO A

03:50:49.802 --> 03:50:51.304
FACILITY LEADERSHIP TEAM SO

03:50:51.370 --> 03:50:53.139
AND I I FEEL VERY STRONGLY

03:50:53.206 --> 03:50:55.575
THAT DURING A CRISIS LEADERSHIP

03:50:55.641 --> 03:50:58.511
IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND

03:50:58.578 --> 03:51:00.646
I I I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

03:51:00.713 --> 03:51:03.316
SPACE AMONGST ALL OF US TO

03:51:03.382 --> 03:51:05.618
RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU DON'T

03:51:05.685 --> 03:51:07.520
HAVE STRONG SOLID LEADERSHIP

03:51:07.587 --> 03:51:09.222
IN A NURSING FACILITY

03:51:09.288 --> 03:51:11.290
ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC

03:51:11.757 --> 03:51:13.059
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PROBLEMS

03:51:13.125 --> 03:51:13.859
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE POOR

03:51:13.926 --> 03:51:15.428
OUTCOMES SO I I THINK THAT'S

03:51:15.494 --> 03:51:17.396
REALLY ONE OF THE KEY AREAS

03:51:17.463 --> 03:51:21.467
FOR ALL OF US TO BE LOOKING AT

03:51:28.941 --> 03:51:30.409
THIS IS VERY ARE YOU WANNA DO

03:51:30.476 --> 03:51:33.579

03:51:52.098 --> 03:51:54.600
FRANCISCO BUT YOU ALL ADVOCATED

03:51:54.667 --> 03:51:59.538
FOR -- YOU KNOW MORE NURSING

03:51:59.839 --> 03:52:00.973
COVERAGE NURSING ASSISTANT

03:52:01.040 --> 03:52:03.809
COVERAGE INCREASE IN WAGES I

03:52:03.876 --> 03:52:06.279
THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE RESPONSE

03:52:06.345 --> 03:52:08.247
FROM MR JOYCE CORNET IN TERMS

03:52:08.314 --> 03:52:10.016
OF THE CHALLENGES AND THE

03:52:10.082 --> 03:52:12.251
DIFFICULTY AND THE SHORTAGE

03:52:12.318 --> 03:52:15.254
OF -- PEOPLE TO GO HIGHER I

03:52:15.321 --> 03:52:18.391
GUESS HOW -- YOU SEE HOW THIS

03:52:18.457 --> 03:52:19.525
RECOMMENDATION HOW WOULD YOU

03:52:19.592 --> 03:52:22.295
ADVISE US TO -- IMPLEMENT

03:52:22.361 --> 03:52:24.830
THIS AND WHAT IS STOPPING

03:52:24.897 --> 03:52:26.899
THIS FROM BEING REALITY

03:52:29.735 --> 03:52:30.970
-- I WOULD START BY SAYING

03:52:31.037 --> 03:52:32.638
TODD BENEFITS SO YOU I KNOW OF

03:52:32.705 --> 03:52:34.874
THAT DID TO PAY HAZARD PAY WHEN

03:52:34.940 --> 03:52:36.175
THEY HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT

03:52:36.242 --> 03:52:37.276
PANDEMIC THAT RESULTED IN

03:52:37.343 --> 03:52:38.778
DOZENS OF DEATHS AND THEY

03:52:38.844 --> 03:52:40.646
THEY PAID THEIR CNA'S MORE

03:52:40.713 --> 03:52:42.214
WHILE THEY WERE AN OUTBREAK

03:52:42.281 --> 03:52:43.049
AND AS SOON AS THE OUTBREAK

03:52:43.115 --> 03:52:44.383
WAS OVER THEY LOWERED THEIR

03:52:44.450 --> 03:52:46.419
PAY AND I THINK THAT SPEAKS

03:52:46.485 --> 03:52:47.953
THE WAY THAT SO MANY CNA'S

03:52:48.020 --> 03:52:49.555
ARE TREATED SO I THINK IT'S

03:52:49.622 --> 03:52:50.790
A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH ONE

03:52:50.856 --> 03:52:52.091
WE NEED TO IMMEDIATELY CHANGE

03:52:52.158 --> 03:52:53.359
THE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE AND

03:52:53.426 --> 03:52:54.727
WHILE SOME OF IT CERTAINLY CAN

03:52:54.794 --> 03:52:55.861
BE PASSED THROUGH AS I ALSO

03:52:55.928 --> 03:52:57.630
SUPPORT WHAT HAS BEEN -- TALKED

03:52:57.697 --> 03:52:58.864
ABOUT AROUND REALLY UNDERSTAND

03:52:58.931 --> 03:53:00.566
THE THE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

03:53:00.633 --> 03:53:01.667
AT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY

03:53:01.734 --> 03:53:02.568
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE REALLY

03:53:02.635 --> 03:53:04.403
GOING BECAUSE LET'S REMEMBER

03:53:04.470 --> 03:53:05.671
HOW THEY'RE BEING PAID IT'S THE

03:53:05.738 --> 03:53:07.940
PEOPLE'S MONEY IT'S OUR MONEY

03:53:08.007 --> 03:53:09.041
SO I THINK IT'S ABOUT TALK

03:53:09.108 --> 03:53:10.476
ABOUT RIGHT BUT REVITALIZING

03:53:10.543 --> 03:53:12.278
AND REVOLUTIONIZING HOW CNA'S

03:53:12.345 --> 03:53:13.813
ARE TRAINED FOR THEIR EXISTING

03:53:13.879 --> 03:53:15.514
JOBS I THINK IT'S ALSO ABOUT

03:53:15.581 --> 03:53:17.216
BUILDING STACKABLE PATHWAYS

03:53:17.416 --> 03:53:19.285
FOR CNA'S TOO BUT ENTER OTHER

03:53:19.352 --> 03:53:21.520
FIELDS LIKE LEN R.

03:53:21.587 --> 03:53:22.088
N.

03:53:22.288 --> 03:53:24.657
-- SURGICAL TECHNOLOGIST OTHER

03:53:24.724 --> 03:53:25.891
FIELDING TO REALLY LOOK AT

03:53:25.958 --> 03:53:27.460
WHAT THAT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

03:53:27.526 --> 03:53:28.527
AND MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT HAVING

03:53:28.594 --> 03:53:29.929
THESE REDUNDANT PATHWAYS MAKING

03:53:29.995 --> 03:53:32.531
IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE I ALSO

03:53:32.598 --> 03:53:33.366
THINK WE THINK WE NEED TO

03:53:33.432 --> 03:53:34.300
LOOK AT WHAT SKILLED NURSING

03:53:34.367 --> 03:53:35.368
FACILITIES LOOK LIKE AS A

03:53:35.434 --> 03:53:37.269
WORKPLACE WHICH IS WHAT EXACTLY

03:53:37.336 --> 03:53:38.571
WHAT DR HARRINGTON WAS TALKING

03:53:38.637 --> 03:53:40.306
ABOUT WHICH IS THAT TWELVE TO

03:53:40.373 --> 03:53:42.408
FIFTEEN CNA'S ON NIGHT SHIFT IS

03:53:42.475 --> 03:53:43.576
MUCH MORE AKIN TO WHAT C.

03:53:43.642 --> 03:53:44.143
N.

03:53:44.210 --> 03:53:45.244
A.'S ARE CARING FOR ON DAY

03:53:45.311 --> 03:53:46.145
SHIFT WHEN THERE IS THE

03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:47.546
HIGHEST LEVEL OF NEEDS WE

03:53:47.613 --> 03:53:49.448
NEED TO LOOK AT HOW FOLKS ARE

03:53:49.515 --> 03:53:50.950
ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK

03:53:51.016 --> 03:53:52.785
IT'S BACKBREAKING INTIMATE

03:53:52.852 --> 03:53:54.253
AND IMPORTANT WORK AND FOR

03:53:54.320 --> 03:53:55.921
MAKING IT POSSIBLE THEM OF

03:53:55.988 --> 03:53:58.023
COURSE PEOPLE DON'T STAY I

03:53:58.090 --> 03:53:59.492
ALSO SUGGEST SURVEYING THE --

03:53:59.558 --> 03:54:01.460
CNA'S WHOSE THEY WERE LICENSE

03:54:01.527 --> 03:54:02.595
WHO ARE NO LONGER WILLING TO

03:54:02.661 --> 03:54:04.096
WORK IN THE FIELD LET'S NOT

03:54:04.163 --> 03:54:05.131
SIMPLY SAY OH IT'S BECAUSE

03:54:05.197 --> 03:54:06.298
OF KIDS ARE ALWAYS BECAUSE OF

03:54:06.365 --> 03:54:07.700
THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCESS

03:54:07.767 --> 03:54:09.435
THEM WHAT WAS HARD ABOUT THIS

03:54:09.502 --> 03:54:11.103
WORK AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO

03:54:11.170 --> 03:54:14.173
GET THEM BACK INTO THE FIELD

03:54:16.275 --> 03:54:17.743
SO COULD YOU COMMENT ON JUST

03:54:17.810 --> 03:54:18.911
BEFORE THE THE SUBJECT ON

03:54:18.978 --> 03:54:21.113
THE THE SHORTAGE OF YOU HEARD

03:54:21.180 --> 03:54:22.214
MISTER CORNET TALK ABOUT A

03:54:22.281 --> 03:54:25.217
THIRTY THOUSAND PERSON --

03:54:25.618 --> 03:54:27.219
SHORTAGE IN THE WORKPLACE

03:54:27.286 --> 03:54:29.588
AND -- I ME I UNDERSTAND I

03:54:29.655 --> 03:54:35.461
UNDERSTAND -- YOUR -- YOUR

03:54:35.528 --> 03:54:37.163
FEELING CUENTA STORAGE DEVICE

03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:38.164
ABOUT HOW TO RESHAPE THE

03:54:38.230 --> 03:54:41.133
WORKPLACE BUT -- LET'S SAY

03:54:41.200 --> 03:54:42.468
WE COULD DO THAT HOW WOULD

03:54:42.535 --> 03:54:45.471
WE GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THAT

03:54:45.538 --> 03:54:48.507
WORK IN INTO THIS FIELD YEAH

03:54:48.574 --> 03:54:50.042
I THINK IT'S ALSO PARTLY ABOUT

03:54:50.109 --> 03:54:51.744
WE COULD LOOK TO SOME OF OUR

03:54:51.811 --> 03:54:53.412
OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE A MEDICAL

03:54:53.479 --> 03:54:55.414
TECHNOLOGY HIGH SCHOOLS AND WE

03:54:55.481 --> 03:54:56.949
FUNNEL YOUNG PEOPLE INTO THAT

03:54:57.016 --> 03:54:58.818
FIELD WELL YOU CAN START WITH

03:54:58.884 --> 03:55:00.820
ANATOMY IN YOUR FIRST YEAR

03:55:00.886 --> 03:55:02.455
AND BY YOUR SENIOR YEAR YOU

03:55:02.521 --> 03:55:04.490
COULD BE WORKING ON YOUR CNA

03:55:04.557 --> 03:55:05.591
PROGRAM CREDENTIALS SO THAT YOU

03:55:05.658 --> 03:55:07.426
LEAVE OUT WITH ENTRANCE INTO

03:55:07.493 --> 03:55:08.360
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND YOU'RE

03:55:08.427 --> 03:55:09.628
ALREADY SEEING A AND YOU HAVE

03:55:09.695 --> 03:55:11.697
A JOB AN EXISTING JOB IT ALSO

03:55:11.764 --> 03:55:13.699
WOULD BE THAT THE CD TRAINING

03:55:13.766 --> 03:55:14.834
CAN TAKE TIME IF YOU'RE DOING

03:55:14.900 --> 03:55:16.235
IT WELL IT'S AN EXTENDED PERIOD

03:55:16.302 --> 03:55:17.937
OF TIME THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS

03:55:18.003 --> 03:55:19.338
ARE ONLY A FEW WEEKS AND I HOLD

03:55:19.405 --> 03:55:20.372
THAT THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATE

03:55:20.439 --> 03:55:22.441
OR NOT TRAINING -- I THINK IT'S

03:55:22.508 --> 03:55:23.809
ABOUT LOOKING AT THAT LIKE GOSH

03:55:23.876 --> 03:55:25.344
CAN WE DO PAID INTERNSHIPS FOR

03:55:25.411 --> 03:55:26.278
PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE TRAINING

03:55:26.345 --> 03:55:27.746
TO BE A SENIOR I THINK IT'S

03:55:27.813 --> 03:55:28.781
ALSO EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF

03:55:28.848 --> 03:55:30.816
PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS

03:55:30.883 --> 03:55:31.951
YOU POINTED OUT IN SOME RURAL

03:55:32.017 --> 03:55:33.953
AREAS IT'S VERY HARD TO BECOME

03:55:34.019 --> 03:55:35.154
A CNA BECAUSE THERE'S NOT

03:55:35.221 --> 03:55:37.056
AND ACCESSIBLE SCHOOL I THINK

03:55:37.122 --> 03:55:38.324
IT'S A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH

03:55:38.390 --> 03:55:39.325
I DON'T JUST THINK IT'S ONE

03:55:39.391 --> 03:55:41.060
THING BUT I THINK PART OF THE

03:55:41.126 --> 03:55:42.595
PROBLEM IS THAT YOU KNOW WE

03:55:42.661 --> 03:55:44.029
HEAR YOU KNOW THE C.

03:55:44.096 --> 03:55:44.630
N.

03:55:44.697 --> 03:55:45.364
A.'S ARE MANY REPORTERS AND

03:55:45.431 --> 03:55:47.166
SO OFTEN THEY REPORT TO US

03:55:47.233 --> 03:55:48.100
ANONYMOUSLY BECAUSE THEY'VE

03:55:48.167 --> 03:55:49.301
MADE OTHER COMPLAINTS THEY'VE

03:55:49.368 --> 03:55:50.870
ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS ISSUES

03:55:50.936 --> 03:55:51.871
OF CARE THAT THEY KNOW ARE

03:55:51.937 --> 03:55:53.472
WRONG THAT AREN'T REALLY TAKEN

03:55:53.539 --> 03:55:55.641
SERIOUSLY THE LICENSING LEVEL

03:55:55.708 --> 03:55:56.509
AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

03:55:56.575 --> 03:55:58.244
ABOUT SAYING THAT THE CNA YOU

03:55:58.310 --> 03:55:59.178
KNOW YOU HAVE THE RESIDENT

03:55:59.245 --> 03:56:00.112
AND THEN RIGHT OUTSIDE THAT

03:56:00.179 --> 03:56:01.313
YOU HAVE THE CNA IN TERMS

03:56:01.380 --> 03:56:03.015
OF LOCUSTS OF CARE AND WE

03:56:03.082 --> 03:56:04.316
NEED TO VALUE THOSE THINGS

03:56:04.383 --> 03:56:06.519
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND HELP THEM

03:56:06.585 --> 03:56:08.921
HELP US TO RESHAPE THE INDUSTRY

03:56:08.988 --> 03:56:09.722
I KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIT OF

03:56:09.788 --> 03:56:10.823
A SORT OF A SOFT ANSWER FOR

03:56:10.890 --> 03:56:11.757
YOU BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT

03:56:11.824 --> 03:56:13.959
WE HAVE TO START IS THAT --

03:56:14.026 --> 03:56:14.960
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY ALL

03:56:15.027 --> 03:56:17.196
THE THE NUMBERS THE DATA WE

03:56:17.263 --> 03:56:18.297
DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF AN

03:56:18.364 --> 03:56:19.198
INSIGHT INTO WHAT C.

03:56:19.265 --> 03:56:19.798
N.

03:56:19.865 --> 03:56:21.200
A.'S LIVES LOOK LIKE I ALSO

03:56:21.267 --> 03:56:22.101
WOULD SAY IF WE'RE SERIOUS

03:56:22.167 --> 03:56:23.168
ABOUT CONTROLLING THE DISEASE

03:56:23.235 --> 03:56:24.870
OF CODE IN LONG TERM CARE WE

03:56:24.937 --> 03:56:25.771
HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT THE

03:56:25.838 --> 03:56:26.939
LIVES OF WHAT OUR SENIORS ARE

03:56:27.006 --> 03:56:28.207
DOING OUTSIDE OF WORK WHICH IS

03:56:28.274 --> 03:56:29.708
THAT MANY OF THEM THEMSELVES

03:56:29.775 --> 03:56:31.710
ARE LIVING IN SORT OF A HIGHLY

03:56:31.777 --> 03:56:32.845
PACKED HOUSING WITH OTHER

03:56:32.912 --> 03:56:34.146
FAMILY MEMBERS WERE ALSO CARE

03:56:34.213 --> 03:56:35.648
GIVERS THEY'RE ALSO STILL

03:56:35.714 --> 03:56:36.849
DOING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT

03:56:36.916 --> 03:56:37.983
WE HAVE TO DO LIKE GROCERY

03:56:38.050 --> 03:56:39.518
SHOPPING LIKES KIDS LIKE IF

03:56:39.585 --> 03:56:40.452
WE WANNA GET SERIOUS ABOUT

03:56:40.519 --> 03:56:41.654
CONTROLLING DISEASE IT'S NOT

03:56:41.720 --> 03:56:42.755
JUST ABOUT THE WORKPLACE IT'S

03:56:42.821 --> 03:56:43.622
WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING THAT

03:56:43.689 --> 03:56:46.692
PERSON TO DO OUTSIDE OF WORK

03:56:46.992 --> 03:56:48.460
I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT BUT

03:56:48.527 --> 03:56:52.765
I THINK WE WE AS LEGISLATORS

03:56:52.831 --> 03:56:55.734
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT -- WHAT

03:56:55.801 --> 03:56:57.570
PROCEDURES OR POLICIES WE CAN

03:56:57.636 --> 03:57:00.673
IMPLEMENT TO REALLY SCALE --

03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:03.309
-- YOUR TO BE ABLE TO SCALE

03:57:03.375 --> 03:57:04.510
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THIS

03:57:04.577 --> 03:57:07.079
IS NOT JUST AT IT THIS IS NOT

03:57:07.146 --> 03:57:09.515
JUST AN ISSUE WITH A FACILITY

03:57:09.582 --> 03:57:11.717
OR TEN PERCENT THE FACILITIES

03:57:11.784 --> 03:57:14.353
THIS IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE ISSUE

03:57:14.420 --> 03:57:17.456
WITH IN THE INDUSTRY -- AND IN

03:57:17.523 --> 03:57:18.924

THE YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS THE

03:57:21.727 --> 03:57:23.228
CONSTANT DRUMBEAT OF MEDICARE

03:57:23.295 --> 03:57:24.496
REIMBURSEMENTS AND IF I HAVE

03:57:24.563 --> 03:57:26.365

03:57:43.349 --> 03:57:45.451
GO DO RIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S

03:57:45.517 --> 03:57:46.719
THAT'S THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE

03:57:46.785 --> 03:57:47.653
BECAUSE I I MEAN I I TOTALLY

03:57:47.720 --> 03:57:48.320
AGREE WITH YOU I THINK WHAT

03:57:48.387 --> 03:57:50.422
YOU SAY MAKES SENSE BUT HOW

03:57:50.489 --> 03:57:52.191
DO WE HOW WE SCALE THAT HOW DO

03:57:52.257 --> 03:57:53.759
WE GROW THAT DISTANCE VERSES

03:57:53.826 --> 03:57:55.628
JUST YOU KNOW HAVING HAVING

03:57:55.694 --> 03:57:56.829
A GREAT STORY AND HAVING YOU

03:57:56.895 --> 03:57:59.331
KNOW THIRTY -- YOU KNOW THIRTY

03:57:59.398 --> 03:58:00.766
PEOPLE BEING IMPACTED WHICH

03:58:00.833 --> 03:58:02.167
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT A PORT

03:58:02.234 --> 03:58:03.235
IT IS VERY PARK THAT'S HOW YOU

03:58:03.302 --> 03:58:04.770
DO THINGS BUT YOU KNOW WHEN

03:58:04.837 --> 03:58:06.639
YOU HAVE HIM TWELVE HUNDRED

03:58:06.705 --> 03:58:08.207
FACILITIES AND HAVE A SHORTFALL

03:58:08.273 --> 03:58:09.975
THAT EACH OF THOSE AND THIS

03:58:10.042 --> 03:58:11.243
FUNDING ALL ACROSS THE STATE

03:58:11.310 --> 03:58:14.380
HOW DO HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT

03:58:14.446 --> 03:58:16.048
SO SIR I WOULD SAY I HAVE A

03:58:16.115 --> 03:58:17.449
PLAN FOR THAT LIKE I WE HAVE

03:58:17.516 --> 03:58:18.751
A PROGRAM THAT IS REPLICABLE

03:58:18.817 --> 03:58:21.220
ACROSS THE STATE TO ALLOW MORE

03:58:21.286 --> 03:58:22.821
QUALIFIED CNA'S TO ENTER THE

03:58:22.888 --> 03:58:25.057
FIELD IT REQUIRES A FINANCIAL

03:58:25.124 --> 03:58:26.859
INVESTMENT OF TRAINING IT

03:58:26.925 --> 03:58:28.193
REQUIRES WRAPAROUND SUPPORT

03:58:28.260 --> 03:58:29.828
SERVICES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS

03:58:29.895 --> 03:58:31.163
AND THEIR CHOIRS US LOOKING

03:58:31.230 --> 03:58:33.298
OUR REGULATORY EDUCATION SYSTEM

03:58:33.365 --> 03:58:35.567
TO KNOCK DOWN SOME ARTIFICIAL

03:58:35.634 --> 03:58:37.369
BARRIERS IN ITS PLACE SO WHAT

03:58:37.436 --> 03:58:38.337
I WOULD SAY IS THE WAY I'D

03:58:38.404 --> 03:58:39.605
FOLLOW UP IS I'D LIKE TO SHARE

03:58:39.672 --> 03:58:40.639
THE CURRICULUM THAT I HAVE

03:58:40.706 --> 03:58:43.042
WITH YOU AND SHARE OUR OUTCOMES

03:58:43.108 --> 03:58:44.843
ACTUALLY EVALUATED BY A FIRM

03:58:44.910 --> 03:58:45.978
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS

03:58:46.045 --> 03:58:47.312
LIKE SO I THINK IT'S MULTI

03:58:47.379 --> 03:58:48.681
PRONGED BUT I THINK IT'S A

03:58:48.747 --> 03:58:50.115
CONTINUING CONVERSATION OF IF

03:58:50.182 --> 03:58:51.684
I HAVE PERMISSION TO REACH OUT

03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:52.851
TO YOUR STAFF TO SHARE THIS

03:58:52.918 --> 03:58:54.520
WITH THEM AND TO CONTINUE THIS

03:58:54.586 --> 03:58:55.788
CONVERSATION OF HOW IT CAN BE

03:58:55.854 --> 03:58:57.022
REPLICATED ACROSS THE STATE

03:58:57.089 --> 03:58:58.090
YOU YOU'RE MORE THE COMMISSION

03:58:58.157 --> 03:58:59.725
WOULD WELCOME IT AND HOW MUCH

03:58:59.792 --> 03:59:02.961
WOULD IT COST SO I CAN TELL

03:59:03.028 --> 03:59:04.163
YOU WHAT IT COSTS ON A LOCAL

03:59:04.229 --> 03:59:05.597
LEVEL AND THAT'S ENTIRELY NEW

03:59:05.664 --> 03:59:07.132
ONES BASED ON WHAT THE ADULT

03:59:07.199 --> 03:59:09.268
EDUCATION STAFF ARE PAID --

03:59:09.334 --> 03:59:11.203
AND ALSO THIS TO WHAT WE ALSO

03:59:11.270 --> 03:59:12.571
ARE SUPPORTED BY A JOHN MUIR

03:59:12.638 --> 03:59:14.606
COMMITTEE HEALTH FUND FOR THE

03:59:14.673 --> 03:59:16.475
SHORT TERM AT THE STATE LEVEL

03:59:16.542 --> 03:59:18.043
I HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT I WOULD

03:59:18.110 --> 03:59:19.211
SAY I DON'T THINK IT'S ACTUALLY

03:59:19.278 --> 03:59:20.112
MORE EXPENSIVE THAT WERE

03:59:20.179 --> 03:59:21.380
ALREADY PROVIDING FOR PEOPLE

03:59:21.447 --> 03:59:22.915
IN TWO WAYS FIRST OF ALL IN

03:59:22.981 --> 03:59:24.650
TERMS OF THERE'S ALREADY WE OWE

03:59:24.717 --> 03:59:26.485
IT DOLLARS BEING ALLOCATED TO

03:59:26.552 --> 03:59:29.154
ADULT EDUCATION AND -- SUPPORT

03:59:29.221 --> 03:59:30.756
OF EDUCATION SERVICES I THINK

03:59:30.823 --> 03:59:31.924
IT'S ABOUT SPECIFICALLY YOU'RE

03:59:31.990 --> 03:59:34.059
MARKING THOSE FOR ENTRY INTO

03:59:34.126 --> 03:59:35.160
A LIGHT HOMEOWNERS WITH THIS

03:59:35.227 --> 03:59:36.528
IS THIS IS BUDGET COMMITTEE

03:59:36.595 --> 03:59:37.730
WHATEVER PEOPLE GIVE ME WORDS

03:59:37.796 --> 03:59:38.931
LAST FOR A NUMBER I JUST NEED

03:59:38.997 --> 03:59:40.799
A NUMBER WITH THE NUMBER NOT

03:59:40.866 --> 03:59:41.967
BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU

03:59:42.034 --> 03:59:44.770
PUT WORDS INTO A BUDGET THAT

03:59:44.837 --> 03:59:46.338
MEANS YOU GOT ZERO MONEY SO

03:59:46.405 --> 03:59:47.473
YOU COULD GET THAT IF YOU WANT

03:59:47.539 --> 03:59:48.507
TO WITH HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE

03:59:48.574 --> 03:59:51.610
TALKING I DON'T KNOW I HAVE

03:59:51.677 --> 03:59:53.045
TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT

03:59:53.112 --> 03:59:54.246
I CAN MAKE UP A NUMBER BUT

03:59:54.313 --> 03:59:55.280
IT'S A HUNDRED PERCENT MADE

03:59:55.347 --> 03:59:56.749
UP AT THIS POINT WELL THAT'S

03:59:56.815 --> 03:59:59.318
NOT BOCANEGRA NUMBER TWO SO

04:00:01.520 --> 04:00:02.988
OKAY I WILL GIVE A SENSE OF

04:00:03.055 --> 04:00:05.457
HOW MUCH IT IS PER PERSON IT

04:00:05.524 --> 04:00:06.558
ALSO JUST JUST SO YOU KNOW

04:00:06.625 --> 04:00:07.993
YOU MENTIONED SORT OF ADULT ED

04:00:08.060 --> 04:00:10.262
JUST REALIZE THAT WE'VE WE'VE

04:00:10.329 --> 04:00:11.997
WE'VE IN MANY WAYS STARTED

04:00:12.064 --> 04:00:13.532
TRANSITIONING ADULT AT INTO

04:00:13.599 --> 04:00:14.666
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE

04:00:14.733 --> 04:00:18.237
WE HAD THAT DEBATE VERSES --

04:00:18.504 --> 04:00:20.606
ADULT ED IN EITHER K.

04:00:20.672 --> 04:00:21.840
THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS ARE

04:00:21.907 --> 04:00:23.475
HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR L.

04:00:23.542 --> 04:00:24.209
AND THAT YOU KNOW KIDS ARE

04:00:24.276 --> 04:00:26.111
TAUGHT DISTRICTS AND ADULT

04:00:26.178 --> 04:00:27.946
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

04:00:28.013 --> 04:00:29.314
THE REASON WE TRANSITIONED

04:00:29.381 --> 04:00:30.349
AND AND I THINK YOUR POINT'S

04:00:30.415 --> 04:00:31.283
WELL TAKEN BUT THE REASON WE

04:00:31.350 --> 04:00:32.518
TRANSITION IS DURING THE LAST

04:00:32.584 --> 04:00:34.119
RECESSION WHEN K.

04:00:34.186 --> 04:00:34.820
THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS

04:00:34.887 --> 04:00:35.654
HOW TO MAKE A CHOICE

04:00:35.721 --> 04:00:37.222
BETWEEN CUTTING K.

04:00:37.289 --> 04:00:38.891
THROUGH TWELVE PER ADULT THAT

04:00:38.957 --> 04:00:40.659
THEY UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE BOARD

04:00:40.726 --> 04:00:42.427
CUT ADULT THAT SO THAT'S WHY

04:00:42.494 --> 04:00:43.962
WE DECIDED TO KIND OF KEEP IT

04:00:44.029 --> 04:00:45.330
WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES SINCE

04:00:45.397 --> 04:00:48.433
THEY SERVE ADULTS ARE MORE SO

04:00:48.500 --> 04:00:49.401
I KNOW I WOULD CHANGE IS YOUR

04:00:49.468 --> 04:00:52.104
OPINION OF TIME WELL I WOULD

04:00:52.171 --> 04:00:53.138
SAY DURING THE THE SCHOOL

04:00:53.205 --> 04:00:54.239
WE WORK WITH DURING THE LAST

04:00:54.306 --> 04:00:55.741
RECESSION WHAT THEY ACTUALLY

04:00:55.808 --> 04:00:57.309
SAW PEOPLE FLOCKING TO SEE

04:00:57.376 --> 04:00:58.443
IN A PER TRAINING PROGRAMS

04:00:58.510 --> 04:01:00.012
BECAUSE THOSE WERE JOBS THAT

04:01:00.078 --> 04:01:01.480
IT WERE HAD OPENINGS AND THAT

04:01:01.547 --> 04:01:02.881
COULD BE FILLED AND PEOPLE

04:01:02.948 --> 04:01:04.249
WHO DONE OTHER JOBS INCLUDING

04:01:04.316 --> 04:01:05.884
PROFESSIONAL YOU KNOW A

04:01:05.951 --> 04:01:07.352
MANAGEMENT LEVEL REALLY NEEDED

04:01:07.419 --> 04:01:09.121
TO WORK SO IN TERMS OF STUDENT

04:01:09.188 --> 04:01:10.255
COSTS IT'S BETWEEN EIGHTEEN

04:01:10.322 --> 04:01:11.290
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

04:01:11.356 --> 04:01:12.691
PER STUDENT DEPENDING ON A

04:01:12.758 --> 04:01:14.259
COUPLE VARIABLES BUT THAT

04:01:14.326 --> 04:01:15.761
COVERS FOOD COMPREHENSIVE

04:01:15.828 --> 04:01:18.931
SUPPORT SERVICES AT TRAINING --

04:01:18.997 --> 04:01:20.465
SO I HEAR YOUR POINT AROUND THE

04:01:20.532 --> 04:01:21.667
ALIGNMENT BUT I ALSO THINK WE

04:01:21.733 --> 04:01:22.668
NEED TO LOOK AT BOTH COMMITTEE

04:01:22.734 --> 04:01:24.670
COLLEGE AND ADULT EDUCATION

04:01:24.736 --> 04:01:26.104
THOSE FUND -- BUT IN THE BUDGET

04:01:26.171 --> 04:01:27.439
BUT I INVITE YOU TO TALK TALK

04:01:27.506 --> 04:01:28.607
TO MISTER CORNET WHO'S RIGHT

04:01:28.674 --> 04:01:31.710
NEXT TO YOU BESIDES BEING THE

04:01:31.777 --> 04:01:33.345
YOU KNOW CO THE THEIR HEALTH

04:01:33.412 --> 04:01:34.780
FACILITIES HE'S ALSO A BUDGET

04:01:34.847 --> 04:01:36.882
GROW SO HE CAN HE CAN HELP YOU

04:01:36.949 --> 04:01:38.784
WITH THAT PARTICULAR YOU JUST

04:01:38.851 --> 04:01:40.485
YOU JUST HEARD IS A THIRTY

04:01:40.552 --> 04:01:43.055
THOUSAND PERSON SHORTAGE AND

04:01:43.121 --> 04:01:44.590
YOU HAVE A PLAN TO SCALE THAT

04:01:44.656 --> 04:01:47.526
I THINK IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY --

04:01:47.593 --> 04:01:49.461
THERE ARE OTHER FIELDS WE HAVE

04:01:49.528 --> 04:01:50.762
PLENTY OF INDUSTRIES WHERE WE

04:01:50.829 --> 04:01:53.098
DON'T HAVE A SHORTAGE ROUGHLY

04:01:53.165 --> 04:01:54.499
DOING WHAT WE CALL IT THIS

04:01:54.566 --> 04:01:56.268
YEAR THIS MAGICAL TRANSITION SO

04:01:56.335 --> 04:01:57.469
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE'RE HEARING

04:01:57.536 --> 04:01:59.204
IN THIS HEARING AND I REALLY

04:01:59.271 --> 04:02:00.305
WOULD URGE YOU KNOW THE TWO

04:02:00.372 --> 04:02:01.874
OF YOU TO TALK ALSO FOR OUR

04:02:01.940 --> 04:02:02.875
MARKET FOR YOU TO TALK WITH

04:02:02.941 --> 04:02:03.842
OUR COMMITTEE WOULD BE MORE

04:02:03.909 --> 04:02:05.878
THAN HAPPY TO UNDERSTAND HOW

04:02:05.944 --> 04:02:07.346
TO YOU KNOW HOW TO THINK ABOUT

04:02:07.412 --> 04:02:10.048
THIS I'M NOT A DOCTOR ONCE

04:02:10.115 --> 04:02:11.516
AGAIN JUST GOING BACK TO YOU

04:02:11.583 --> 04:02:12.718
YOU JUST THE SAME SAME KIND

04:02:12.784 --> 04:02:14.620
OF QUESTION YOU MENTIONED YOU

04:02:14.686 --> 04:02:16.421
KNOW MORE MORE ARE IN COVERAGE

04:02:16.488 --> 04:02:18.690
MORE COVERAGE MORE RESOURCES

04:02:18.757 --> 04:02:21.460
HOW DO WE HOW HOW DO WE DO IT

04:02:21.526 --> 04:02:23.462
I ASSUME IF THE THE FACILITIES

04:02:23.528 --> 04:02:24.563
HAD THE MONEY TO DO THE STATE

04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:26.698
ALREADY BE DOING IT SO HOW

04:02:26.765 --> 04:02:29.768
DOES THIS BECOME A REALITY OKAY

04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:34.172
OKAY -- CAN YOU HEAR ME OK

04:02:34.239 --> 04:02:35.007
WE CAN HEAR YOU GREAT HAVING

04:02:35.073 --> 04:02:36.541
A LITTLE FEEDBACK HERE WE

04:02:36.608 --> 04:02:40.679
GET OKAY SO ACTUALLY I WANNA

04:02:40.746 --> 04:02:43.348
FRAME THIS TWO WAYS FIRST THE

04:02:43.415 --> 04:02:45.417
NURSING HOME INDUSTRY IS AT AN

04:02:45.484 --> 04:02:48.253
INFLECTION POINT RIGHT NOW AND

04:02:48.921 --> 04:02:51.490
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND AND

04:02:51.556 --> 04:02:52.691
ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES I'LL

04:02:52.758 --> 04:02:55.394
GIVE YOU -- IS WHAT ASSEMBLY

04:02:55.460 --> 04:02:57.729
MAN WHAT DID WITH HIS BILL WE

04:02:57.796 --> 04:03:00.332
RECOMMENDED THE SECOND WEEK

04:03:00.399 --> 04:03:02.501
OF MARCH THAT EVERY NURSING

04:03:02.567 --> 04:03:05.704
HOME IN THE STATE HAVE A FULL

04:03:05.771 --> 04:03:08.206
TIME INFECTION PREVENTION NEST

04:03:08.573 --> 04:03:09.474
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE

04:03:09.541 --> 04:03:12.044
HEARD FROM VARIOUS FOLKS WAS

04:03:12.311 --> 04:03:14.079
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT AND MY

04:03:14.146 --> 04:03:16.381
RESPONSE WAS YOU CAN'T AFFORD

04:03:16.448 --> 04:03:18.817
NOT TO THERE IS SOMETHING

04:03:18.884 --> 04:03:22.020
CALLED INVESTING IN QUALITY

04:03:22.220 --> 04:03:23.088
SHOW THAT YOU HAVE BETTER

04:03:23.155 --> 04:03:25.691
OUTCOMES IN YOU SAVE MONEY AND

04:03:25.757 --> 04:03:29.261
SO ON I I QUESTION THE PREMISE

04:03:29.461 --> 04:03:31.363
THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN

04:03:31.430 --> 04:03:34.366
STAFFING NECESSARILY ARE GOING

04:03:34.433 --> 04:03:38.437
TO LEAD TO A NET LOSS OF MONEY

04:03:38.503 --> 04:03:41.940
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE NOT FOR

04:03:42.007 --> 04:03:46.745
PROFITS THAT DO DO FINE AND SO

04:03:47.112 --> 04:03:49.147
I HONESTLY THINK THE INDUSTRY

04:03:49.214 --> 04:03:51.049
NEEDS TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR

04:03:51.116 --> 04:03:53.785
AND DECIDE AS AS BOTH MISTER

04:03:53.852 --> 04:03:56.154
NAZARIAN WOULD MENTIONED WHERE

04:03:56.221 --> 04:03:58.190
DOES THE REAL ESTATE FLOW

04:03:58.256 --> 04:04:01.159
WHERE THE FUNDS FLOW I SAID I

04:04:01.226 --> 04:04:02.694
SAID IN THE ASSEMBLY HEARING

04:04:02.761 --> 04:04:04.062
TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEES BACK

04:04:04.129 --> 04:04:07.399
IN JUNE THE LARGE NURSING ON

04:04:07.466 --> 04:04:09.001
CHANGE IN THIS STATEMENT CROSS

04:04:09.067 --> 04:04:11.269
THE COUNTRY COULD EASILY HAVE

04:04:11.336 --> 04:04:14.339
LEVERAGED THEIR ASSETS TO

04:04:14.406 --> 04:04:15.841
ACQUIRE ABUNDANT P.

04:04:15.907 --> 04:04:16.108
P.

04:04:16.174 --> 04:04:16.408
E.

04:04:16.475 --> 04:04:17.075
N.

04:04:17.142 --> 04:04:19.611
TESTING IN MARCH AND APRIL WHEN

04:04:19.678 --> 04:04:21.246
THE EXPERTS WERE SAYING THAT'S

04:04:21.313 --> 04:04:23.615
WHAT WE NEEDED THEY HAD NO

04:04:23.682 --> 04:04:25.751
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO DO

04:04:25.817 --> 04:04:28.153
THAT AND THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY

04:04:28.220 --> 04:04:30.522
I ONLY TAKE A STEP ON THE FLOOR

04:04:30.589 --> 04:04:32.791
THERE ARE SOME DARK OPERATORS

04:04:32.858 --> 04:04:35.360
DR ONE DID SORRY ARE YOU JUST

04:04:35.427 --> 04:04:36.895
SAYING THEY THEY COULD THEY

04:04:36.962 --> 04:04:38.130
COULD BRING IN MORE PEOPLE NOW

04:04:38.196 --> 04:04:39.231
THEY'RE JUST CHOOSING NOT TO

04:04:39.297 --> 04:04:41.199
BECAUSE OF PROFIT BECAUSE WE

04:04:41.266 --> 04:04:43.535
HAVEN'T SEEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF

04:04:43.602 --> 04:04:45.037
CONSTRUCTION RATES ARE PROBLEMS

04:04:45.103 --> 04:04:47.439
IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR THAT

04:04:47.506 --> 04:04:48.573
IN ESSENCE MAY BE DEALING

04:04:48.640 --> 04:04:50.575
WITH EVEN UP FOR CLIENTELE

04:04:50.642 --> 04:04:52.344
SO THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE

04:04:52.411 --> 04:04:53.945
SAYING WE COULD DO IT RIGHT

04:04:54.012 --> 04:04:55.781
NOW IS JUST THE PROFIT MOTIVES

04:04:55.847 --> 04:04:57.449
GETTING IN THE WAY DISTRICT

04:04:57.516 --> 04:04:59.518
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

04:05:02.654 --> 04:05:03.722
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND

04:05:03.789 --> 04:05:05.624
ACTUALLY THE DATA THERE IS

04:05:05.690 --> 04:05:08.927
DATA SHOWING -- FEWER OUTBREAKS

04:05:08.994 --> 04:05:10.328
FEWER DEATHS IN NOT FOR

04:05:10.395 --> 04:05:12.864
PROFITS VERSUS FOR PROFIT AND

04:05:12.931 --> 04:05:14.699
LOOK I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR I I

04:05:14.766 --> 04:05:16.301
BELIEVE IN THE PROFIT MOTIVE

04:05:16.368 --> 04:05:19.604
-- AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN'T

04:05:19.671 --> 04:05:21.706
ABUSE THAT PRIVILEGE AND I

04:05:21.773 --> 04:05:23.141
I THINK THE INDUSTRY REALLY

04:05:23.208 --> 04:05:25.010
HAS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT

04:05:25.077 --> 04:05:26.378
HOW MUCH MONEY IT WANTS TO

04:05:26.445 --> 04:05:27.879
MAKE AND WHERE IT WANTS TO

04:05:27.946 --> 04:05:29.948
MAKE IT AND THAT'S WHERE ALL

04:05:30.015 --> 04:05:31.416
THE OTHER TRANSPARENCY ISSUES

04:05:31.483 --> 04:05:32.818
COME IN AYE I DON'T THINK THE

04:05:32.884 --> 04:05:34.553
STATE SHOULD HAVE TO SPEND

04:05:34.619 --> 04:05:36.121
EXTRA MONEY IN IN IN FACT THE

04:05:36.188 --> 04:05:38.356
REASON WE RECOMMENDED THAT

04:05:38.423 --> 04:05:39.958
FULL TIME INFECTION PREVENTION

04:05:40.025 --> 04:05:42.661
IS BACK IN MARCH WAS IT THAT

04:05:42.727 --> 04:05:44.129
WOULDN'T COST THE STATE A

04:05:44.196 --> 04:05:47.199
CENT AND IN FACT IT WOULD TAKE

04:05:47.265 --> 04:05:48.600
PEOPLE THAT THE NURSING HOMES

04:05:48.667 --> 04:05:50.769
ALREADY HACKED BECAUSE EVERY

04:05:50.836 --> 04:05:52.871
NURSING HOME ALREADY HAS AN

04:05:52.938 --> 04:05:54.539
INFECTION PREVENTION NEST IT'S

04:05:54.606 --> 04:05:55.540
JUST THAT THEY'RE TYPICALLY

04:05:55.607 --> 04:05:56.675
PULLED IN TWELVE DIFFERENT

04:05:56.741 --> 04:05:58.677
ELECTION DIRECTIONS AND NOT

04:05:58.743 --> 04:06:01.313
ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB AND

04:06:01.379 --> 04:06:02.581
TO BE TO BE VERY HONEST IN

04:06:02.647 --> 04:06:05.917
A LOT OF WAYS THERE WAS JUST

04:06:05.984 --> 04:06:07.853
RESISTANCE BECAUSE FOLKS DON'T

04:06:07.919 --> 04:06:09.788
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO

04:06:09.855 --> 04:06:11.490
INVEST IN DOING THE RIGHT

04:06:11.556 --> 04:06:13.625
THING AND PROVIDING QUALITY

04:06:13.692 --> 04:06:16.228
CARE IN ORDER TO BE PROFITABLE

04:06:16.294 --> 04:06:17.629
THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE AND I

04:06:17.696 --> 04:06:18.964
I THINK THAT IS THAT IS SORT

04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:20.565
OF A MANTRA I BELIEVE IN AND

04:06:20.632 --> 04:06:21.833
I TOO WOULD BE HAPPY TO SPEND

04:06:21.900 --> 04:06:23.168
TIME WITH YOUR STAFF TO IN

04:06:23.235 --> 04:06:25.704
TERMS OF I LOVE NUMBERS --

04:06:25.770 --> 04:06:28.140
SO I AND I I DO BELIEVE THAT

04:06:28.206 --> 04:06:31.143
THIS INDUSTRY CAN SURVIVE BUT

04:06:31.343 --> 04:06:32.210
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A

04:06:32.277 --> 04:06:34.312
HUGE DECISION IN TERMS OF HOW

04:06:34.379 --> 04:06:35.780
MUCH PROFIT AND WE'RE THAT

04:06:35.847 --> 04:06:37.549
PROFITS GOING TO BE IF THEY

04:06:37.616 --> 04:06:39.885
DO WANT TO SURVIVE THANK YOU

04:06:39.951 --> 04:06:41.353
DR OSMAN JUST FOR ONE SECOND I

04:06:41.419 --> 04:06:42.554
DON'T HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT

04:06:42.621 --> 04:06:44.689
WE'VE HAD SOME VERY PATIENT

04:06:44.756 --> 04:06:46.158
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE

04:06:46.224 --> 04:06:48.760
TO LEAVE -- SO I AM GOING TO GO

04:06:48.827 --> 04:06:51.696
OUT OF ORDER AND ALLOW PEOPLE

04:06:51.763 --> 04:06:53.698

AWAY BEFORE I EXPERIENCED SOME

04:07:45.383 --> 04:07:49.354
HARDSHIPS ON IT'S EMBARRASSING

04:07:49.421 --> 04:07:50.989
TO SAVOR BASICALLY I WAS

TOP OF A DRUG ON MY DOORKNOB

04:08:01.566 --> 04:08:03.501
WHICH BASICALLY TORTURED ME

04:08:03.568 --> 04:08:06.771
WITH SOME KIND OF THE BRAIN

04:08:06.838 --> 04:08:09.174
VIRUS I DON'T KNOWS DIFFICULT

04:08:09.241 --> 04:08:10.442
IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN I CAN

04:08:10.508 --> 04:08:13.878

04:08:30.228 --> 04:08:31.529
KIND OF BIO TECHNOLOGIST MAYBE

04:08:31.596 --> 04:08:33.198

THIS ROOM WELCOME TO DAY TWO

04:09:56.147 --> 04:09:57.282
HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT OF

04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:59.017
FLATTENING THE CURVE IT IS

04:09:59.084 --> 04:10:00.652
EVIDENT YOU HAVE CONTINUED ON

04:10:00.719 --> 04:10:02.420
THIS PATH TO ENSURE RECEIPT OF

04:10:02.487 --> 04:10:04.656
CARES AND OTHER GRANT FUNDING

04:10:04.723 --> 04:10:05.924
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT WE

04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:07.292
ARE NOT INTERESTED IN KERR'S

04:10:07.359 --> 04:10:08.893
MONEY BECAUSE CARE IS MONEY

04:10:08.960 --> 04:10:10.795
IS BLOOD MONEY IT IS THE BLOOD

04:10:10.862 --> 04:10:12.130
MONEY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS IS

04:10:12.197 --> 04:10:14.265
DYING AND THE FORCED ISOLATION

04:10:14.332 --> 04:10:16.000
OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE THE

04:10:16.067 --> 04:10:17.969
ELDERLY AND OTHER POPULATIONS

04:10:18.036 --> 04:10:20.138
IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

04:10:20.205 --> 04:10:22.374
NO AMOUNT OF MONEY IS WORTH

04:10:22.440 --> 04:10:24.576
THE SACRIFICE THE NATIONAL

04:10:24.642 --> 04:10:26.111
CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS

04:10:26.177 --> 04:10:28.413
EMPHASIZED THAT MOST DEATHS

04:10:28.480 --> 04:10:30.281
ARE NOT BICYCLE THAT BUT WITH

04:10:30.348 --> 04:10:32.117
COLD IT THE STATE HAS COMBINED

04:10:32.183 --> 04:10:33.351
THE DATA SETTING THE RATES

04:10:33.418 --> 04:10:35.720
BY COLD IT ARTIFICIALLY HIGH

04:10:35.787 --> 04:10:37.122
ONLY SIX PERCENT OF THOSE

04:10:37.188 --> 04:10:39.324
DEATHS HAD NO COAL MORBIDITY

04:10:39.391 --> 04:10:41.159
ON THEIR DEATH CERTIFICATES IN

04:10:41.226 --> 04:10:43.027
ADDITION THE PCR TEST FURTHER

04:10:43.094 --> 04:10:44.963
INFLATES THE POSITIVITY RATES

04:10:45.029 --> 04:10:47.399
DUE TO FALSE POSITIVES WE ARE

04:10:47.465 --> 04:10:49.000
ISOLATING PEOPLE TO THE POINT

04:10:49.067 --> 04:10:51.503
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DIE

04:10:51.569 --> 04:10:52.871
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY WILL BE

04:10:52.937 --> 04:10:54.973
OKAY WITH THIS CASES ARE NOT

04:10:55.039 --> 04:10:56.808
ILLNESSES THIS IS THE FIRST

04:10:56.875 --> 04:10:58.777
TIME IN HISTORY WE HAVE TESTED

04:10:58.843 --> 04:11:00.845
HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS FOR TRACES

04:11:00.912 --> 04:11:02.380
OF THE VIRUS AND USE THESE

04:11:02.447 --> 04:11:04.783
TESTS AS RATIONALE TO DECIMATE

04:11:04.849 --> 04:11:06.751
OUR ECONOMY AND PREVENT PEOPLE

04:11:06.818 --> 04:11:08.553
FROM EXPERIENCING LOVE JOY

04:11:08.620 --> 04:11:10.588
AND CONNECTION FRANKLY I'M

04:11:10.655 --> 04:11:12.023
HORRIFIED BY THE LANGUAGE I'M

04:11:12.090 --> 04:11:13.758
HEARING ABOUT PEOPLE NEEDING

04:11:13.825 --> 04:11:15.226
TO SUBMIT TO THE FLU SHOT

04:11:15.293 --> 04:11:17.128
AND THE COVERT SHOT MANDATED

04:11:17.195 --> 04:11:18.930
MEDICINE IS A DISGRACE NOW

PROGRAM I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOU

04:18:58.856 --> 04:19:01.492
THAT DID TO CHEAT TO GET THE

04:19:01.559 --> 04:19:03.027
WORK FORCE WE NEED IT'S GOING

04:19:03.094 --> 04:19:05.429
TO REQUIRE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

04:19:05.496 --> 04:19:07.298
ARROWS IN THE QUIVER I THERE'S

04:19:07.365 --> 04:19:08.633
NOT GONNA BE ONE WAY TO DO

04:19:08.699 --> 04:19:09.667
THIS BUT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE

04:19:09.734 --> 04:19:10.701
A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

04:19:10.768 --> 04:19:12.570
SALARY AT AND PROGRAMS LIKE

04:19:12.637 --> 04:19:14.472
MISS HOW MENTIONED AND OTHER

04:19:14.538 --> 04:19:16.040
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE

04:19:16.107 --> 04:19:17.275
COULD PROMOTE TO THE COMMUNITY

04:19:17.341 --> 04:19:18.509
COLLEGES WERE WORKING WITH

04:19:18.576 --> 04:19:20.244
COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONSTANTLY

04:19:20.578 --> 04:19:22.580
TO TRY TO GET MORE OF THAT

04:19:22.647 --> 04:19:24.448
WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR

04:19:24.515 --> 04:19:25.149
PARTICULAR FOR C.

04:19:25.216 --> 04:19:25.716
N.

04:19:25.783 --> 04:19:27.351
A.'S BUT ALSO FOR LPNS AND

04:19:27.418 --> 04:19:30.021
OUR ENDS AS WELL OF THE BOOT

04:19:30.087 --> 04:19:31.055
THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS IS

04:19:31.122 --> 04:19:32.290
GOING TO TAKE OUT A MULTI

04:19:32.356 --> 04:19:34.358
PRONGED APPROACH GOING FORWARD

04:19:34.625 --> 04:19:36.027
CERTAINLY AND I WOULD SAY SIX

04:19:36.093 --> 04:19:37.528
CERTAINLY A NON SALARIES ARE

04:19:37.595 --> 04:19:38.863
AN ISSUE I JUST WANT TO BUT

04:19:38.930 --> 04:19:40.031
LET ME LET ME JUST EMPHASIZE

04:19:40.097 --> 04:19:41.299
AGAIN ON THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE

04:19:41.365 --> 04:19:43.034
PROFITS AND AND AND AND SO

04:19:43.100 --> 04:19:45.703
FORTH -- I MEAN RIGHT NOW AND

04:19:45.770 --> 04:19:47.104
THAT THIS CAME UP EARLIER FOR

04:19:47.171 --> 04:19:48.739
MR THE SYRIAN ABOUT THE READ

04:19:48.806 --> 04:19:50.074
THE PROFITS I WANT TO MAKE

04:19:50.141 --> 04:19:52.109
SURE THAT YOU AWARE OF THIS

04:19:52.176 --> 04:19:53.644
THE MEDIC CAL REIMBURSEMENT

04:19:53.711 --> 04:19:55.813
SYSTEM FOR CAPITAL COST THEY'RE

04:19:55.880 --> 04:19:57.148
THEY'RE BASED ON WHAT'S CALLED

04:19:57.214 --> 04:19:59.450
A FAIR RENTAL SYSTEM THAT'S

04:19:59.517 --> 04:20:01.485
CALCULATED BY THE STATE AND

04:20:01.552 --> 04:20:02.987
IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

04:20:03.054 --> 04:20:05.256
ACTUAL LEASES MORTGAGES AND

04:20:05.323 --> 04:20:06.457
THAT KIND OF THING SO THAT'S

04:20:06.524 --> 04:20:08.960
ALL EXCLUDED ALREADY TO THE

04:20:09.026 --> 04:20:10.628
MEDIC HOUSE I SAID DOESN'T

04:20:10.695 --> 04:20:12.263
PAY FOR THAT RELATED ANY

04:20:12.330 --> 04:20:14.699
RELATED PARTY PROFIT EITHER --

04:20:14.765 --> 04:20:16.634
THAT'S ALL REMOVED THROUGH THE

04:20:16.701 --> 04:20:18.536
THROUGH THE AUDIT PROCESS AND

04:20:18.602 --> 04:20:21.739
ULTIMATELY THOUGH -- AT AFTER

04:20:21.806 --> 04:20:24.175
YOU MAKE ALL THOSE ADJUSTMENTS

04:20:24.241 --> 04:20:25.409
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THAT

04:20:25.476 --> 04:20:27.144
IS LEFT IS EVEN CONSTRAINT

04:20:27.211 --> 04:20:28.879
EVEN MORE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

04:20:28.946 --> 04:20:30.214
REFER TO SELL THESE ALL REPORT

04:20:30.281 --> 04:20:32.450
THEIR ACTUAL COST AND THE RATE

04:20:32.516 --> 04:20:34.685
IS BASED ON THEIR ACTUAL COST

04:20:34.752 --> 04:20:36.587
AGAIN AUDITED A LOT OF COST

04:20:36.654 --> 04:20:38.689
EXCLUDED PROFIT EXCLUDED SO

04:20:38.756 --> 04:20:41.092
FORTH FROM IT FROM THE -- FROM

04:20:41.158 --> 04:20:43.060
THE THIRD PARTY -- PARTIES AND

04:20:43.127 --> 04:20:44.495
SO FORTH AND THEN AFTER THAT

04:20:44.562 --> 04:20:45.863
HAPPENS THEN THEIR RATES ARE

04:20:45.930 --> 04:20:47.832
REDUCED EVEN MORE BY AT LEAST

04:20:47.898 --> 04:20:49.333
SIX PERCENT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

04:20:49.400 --> 04:20:51.135
OF THE MEDIC CAL RATES IF

04:20:51.202 --> 04:20:52.570
MEDIC CAL WASN'T CUTTING THAT

04:20:52.636 --> 04:20:54.538
BACK YOU BE BE ABLE TO FULLY

04:20:54.605 --> 04:20:55.940
REIMBURSE FACILITIES FOR THEIR

04:20:56.007 --> 04:20:57.575
COSTS THEIR THEIR COST WOULD

04:20:57.641 --> 04:20:58.909
STILL BE YOU KNOW CONSTRAINED

04:20:58.976 --> 04:21:00.711
TO SOME DEGREE BUT THEY WOULD

04:21:00.778 --> 04:21:01.879
HAVE MORE MONEY THAT I WOULD

04:21:01.946 --> 04:21:03.647
SAY TO BE ABLE TO PASS ALONG

04:21:03.714 --> 04:21:05.149
IN IN SALARIES THAT THE BEST

04:21:05.216 --> 04:21:06.884
WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IN OUR

04:21:06.951 --> 04:21:08.919
VIEW IS FOR THE STATE TO TO

04:21:08.986 --> 04:21:10.821
PAY DIRECTLY THE LABOR COSTS

04:21:10.888 --> 04:21:12.790
THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT LABOR

04:21:12.857 --> 04:21:15.126
OUTSIDE THE BUDGETARY CAP THAT

04:21:15.192 --> 04:21:16.560
WOULD MEAN THE DH CS COULD

04:21:16.627 --> 04:21:18.262
FULLY REIMBURSED FACILITIES

04:21:18.462 --> 04:21:20.264
FOR THEIR ACTUAL LABOR COST

04:21:20.331 --> 04:21:21.399
WHICH WOULD ALLOW FACILITIES

04:21:21.465 --> 04:21:23.134
TO INCREASE THEIR WAGES AND YOU

04:21:23.200 --> 04:21:25.469
KNOW RETAIN WORKERS -- PROVIDE

04:21:25.536 --> 04:21:26.570
HIGHER AND HIGHER QUALITY

04:21:26.637 --> 04:21:28.039
CARE IN GENERAL SO I THINK WE

04:21:28.105 --> 04:21:29.240
THINK THAT'S THE THAT'S THE

04:21:29.306 --> 04:21:30.775
NUMBER ONE THING I WOULD SAY

04:21:30.841 --> 04:21:31.842
THAT WE COULD HAVE THE BIGGEST

04:21:31.909 --> 04:21:33.878
IMPACT THANK YOU INDEED YOU HAD

04:21:33.944 --> 04:21:34.779
MENTIONED EARLIER P.

04:21:34.845 --> 04:21:35.446
P.

04:21:35.513 --> 04:21:36.580
AND TESTING HAS THAT ISSUE BEEN

04:21:36.647 --> 04:21:37.948
RESOLVED IN TERMS OF ADEQUATE

04:21:38.015 --> 04:21:40.885
PPE ADEQUATE TESTING I WOULD

04:21:40.951 --> 04:21:42.219
SAY IT IS MUCH BETTER I DON'T

04:21:42.286 --> 04:21:43.320
WANT TO SAY IT'S RESOLVED

04:21:43.387 --> 04:21:45.389
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WE WE STILL

04:21:45.456 --> 04:21:46.857
SEE SHORTAGES EVERY ONCE IN

04:21:46.924 --> 04:21:49.627
AWHILE IT SOMETIMES -- -- FOR

04:21:49.693 --> 04:21:51.062
-- FOR A WHILE IT WAS DOWN TO

04:21:51.128 --> 04:21:52.329
THAN IT WAS A MASK THEN IT WAS

04:21:52.396 --> 04:21:53.898
GLOVES AND IT'S GONE BACK AND

04:21:53.964 --> 04:21:55.800
FORTH AND I THINK THE OTHER

04:21:55.866 --> 04:21:57.768
SUPPLY CHAINS INTO THE UNITED

04:21:57.835 --> 04:21:59.470
TO THE SUMMIT TO THIS PP IS

04:21:59.537 --> 04:22:00.871
MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE THE UNITED

04:22:00.938 --> 04:22:02.306
STATES WE'VE HAD THEY'VE BEEN

04:22:02.373 --> 04:22:04.341
USED BY CHAIN ISSUES SO I WOULD

04:22:04.408 --> 04:22:05.609
SAY THE SITUATION IS BETTER

04:22:05.676 --> 04:22:07.578
BUT IT'S STILL NOT NOT TOTALLY

04:22:07.645 --> 04:22:09.213
PERFECT AS YOU KNOW THOUGH SB

04:22:09.280 --> 04:22:10.981
TWO SEVENTY FIVE IS GOING TO

04:22:11.048 --> 04:22:12.750
REQUIRE THE STATE TO TO BUILD

04:22:12.817 --> 04:22:15.019
A MUCH BIGGER STOCKPILE OF UP

04:22:15.086 --> 04:22:17.221
TP -- YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD

04:22:17.288 --> 04:22:18.222
AND I THINK THAT'LL HELP IN THE

04:22:18.289 --> 04:22:21.258
FUTURE OF THE TESTING TESTING

04:22:21.325 --> 04:22:23.627
IS CERTAINLY IMPROVED BUT AGAIN

04:22:23.694 --> 04:22:25.763
YOU KNOW TEST RESULTS ARE MOST

04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:27.331
VALUABLE IF THEY IF THE RESULTS

04:22:27.398 --> 04:22:28.499
CAN COME BACK IN TWENTY FOUR

04:22:28.566 --> 04:22:30.334
HOURS OR LESS I'M SO THERE

04:22:30.401 --> 04:22:31.669
ARE STILL SOME CHALLENGES IN

04:22:31.735 --> 04:22:33.337
THAT ARENA IT THERE CERTAINLY

04:22:33.404 --> 04:22:34.805
BETTER THAT THE TURN AROUND

04:22:34.872 --> 04:22:36.607
TIME IS CERTAINLY BETTER AS I

04:22:36.674 --> 04:22:38.109
MENTIONED EARLIER THOUGH THERE

04:22:38.175 --> 04:22:39.543
ARE LOGISTICAL ISSUES WITH THE

04:22:39.610 --> 04:22:41.445
TESTING THOUGH IN SOME CASES

04:22:41.512 --> 04:22:42.880
FOR THE STAFF TESTING THEY HAVE

04:22:42.947 --> 04:22:44.648
TO LEAVE THE BUILDING -- GO

04:22:44.715 --> 04:22:46.417
TO THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER

04:22:46.484 --> 04:22:48.018
SOME FACILITIES ARE ABLE TO

04:22:48.085 --> 04:22:49.954
DO THE TESTING AND HOW IT

04:22:50.020 --> 04:22:51.255
TAKE THE TEST IN HOUSE SEND

04:22:51.322 --> 04:22:53.524
IT OFF TO THE LAB -- HOPEFULLY

04:22:53.591 --> 04:22:54.558
IT COMES BACK IN LESS THAN

04:22:54.625 --> 04:22:56.527
TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO I I I

04:22:56.594 --> 04:22:57.595
WOULD JUST EIGHTY IT'S IT'S

04:22:57.661 --> 04:22:59.230
IMPROVED I DON'T THINK IT'S

04:22:59.296 --> 04:23:01.298
TOTALLY THERE AT ALL -- BUT I

04:23:01.365 --> 04:23:02.600
DID MENTION THE PERKIN ELMER

04:23:02.666 --> 04:23:03.968
LAB AND HEIDI MENTIONED THAT

04:23:04.034 --> 04:23:06.070
TO THAT MAY HELP GOING FORWARD

04:23:06.137 --> 04:23:07.638
YEAH THAT'S WE HOPE TO SUPPORT

04:23:07.705 --> 04:23:09.607
THE TESTING LEVEL HELP AND

04:23:09.673 --> 04:23:11.242
HOPEFULLY YOU SEEN IMPROVEMENTS

04:23:11.308 --> 04:23:13.611
WITH PP SINCE WE IT WENT INTO

04:23:13.677 --> 04:23:15.279
A VARIETY OF CONTRACTS WITH

04:23:15.346 --> 04:23:17.348
DIFFERENT SUPPLIERS FOR THAT

04:23:17.882 --> 04:23:20.885
THAT'S RIGHT SO THEN JUST ARM

04:23:20.951 --> 04:23:23.320
GOING TO MISS A STARTER OR

04:23:23.387 --> 04:23:25.723
MISS HARRINGTON YOU YOU HEARD

04:23:25.789 --> 04:23:27.458
MR QUARTETS COMMENTS ABOUT THE

04:23:27.525 --> 04:23:30.294
MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENTS RESTORED

04:23:30.361 --> 04:23:33.030
THE SHORTAGE OF THAT -- THAT

04:23:33.097 --> 04:23:34.398
BEING A MAJOR ISSUE HOW HOW

04:23:34.465 --> 04:23:36.967
WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE

04:23:39.069 --> 04:23:40.104
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WENDY

04:23:40.171 --> 04:23:41.038
HARRINGTON WITH A PARTNER

04:23:41.105 --> 04:23:42.339
HEALTHCARE SERVICE THAT I

04:23:42.406 --> 04:23:45.409
MEAN I THINK AGAIN I THINK YOU

04:23:45.476 --> 04:23:46.944
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER IT IN A

04:23:47.011 --> 04:23:48.946
BROADER SCOPE AND WE HAVE TO BE

04:23:49.013 --> 04:23:51.248
VERY RESPONSIBLE SO YOU DO NEED

04:23:51.315 --> 04:23:54.084
TO LOOK AT AND AGAIN WE WE HAVE

04:23:54.151 --> 04:23:55.686
IN THE CALCULATION AT THE NIGHT

04:23:55.753 --> 04:23:57.521
THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE

04:23:57.588 --> 04:24:00.090
EVERYTHING THAT DOES DO --

04:24:00.157 --> 04:24:02.059
YOU KNOW REALLY INCENTIVIZES

04:24:02.126 --> 04:24:04.261
DAY UTILIZATION AND AND AND

04:24:04.328 --> 04:24:06.664
THAT INVESTMENT IN Q.

04:24:06.730 --> 04:24:08.766
AND LABOR ADDITIONALLY IF WE

04:24:08.832 --> 04:24:12.002
LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE WE DO

04:24:12.069 --> 04:24:14.104
CALCULATIONS AND RIGHT NOW

04:24:14.171 --> 04:24:16.040
WE REIMBURSED APPROXIMATELY

04:24:16.106 --> 04:24:18.642
NINETY SIX PERCENT -- THAT

04:24:18.709 --> 04:24:20.844
CLOCKED FOR MEDIC HOW AND WE

04:24:20.911 --> 04:24:21.779
DO SOMETHING CALLED THE UPPER

04:24:21.845 --> 04:24:23.180
PAYMENT LIMIT CALCULATION THAT

04:24:23.247 --> 04:24:24.215
WE HAVE TO PROVIDE COULD BE A

04:24:24.281 --> 04:24:25.449
MASCULINE SURE THAT OUR RATES

04:24:25.516 --> 04:24:27.451
ARE NOT ABOUT -- THE UPPER

04:24:27.518 --> 04:24:28.953
PAYMENT LIMIT AND A PART OF

04:24:29.019 --> 04:24:30.955
THAT CALCULATION WE LOOK AT

04:24:31.021 --> 04:24:33.691
-- I HAVE A WHOLE GROUP AND

04:24:33.757 --> 04:24:35.159
BASED ON THAT VEHICLE YOU'RE

04:24:35.226 --> 04:24:37.928
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN CALCULATION I

04:24:37.995 --> 04:24:39.763
WE WERE REIMBURSING FOR MATTER

04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:41.966
HOW ONLY APPROXIMATELY NINETY

04:24:42.032 --> 04:24:45.035
SIX PERCENT OF THE TOTAL COST

04:24:48.305 --> 04:24:49.940
OKAY AND THEN THE BIGGEST

04:24:50.007 --> 04:24:51.809
THE DO YOU HAVE THE FACILITY

04:24:51.875 --> 04:24:53.744
SAYING THAT STILL STILL NOT

04:24:53.811 --> 04:24:57.014
ENOUGH WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN

04:24:57.081 --> 04:24:58.682
JUST MISSED MISTAKES -- SERVES

04:24:58.749 --> 04:25:01.385
KOURNIKOVA PLEASE MHM FIRST

04:25:01.452 --> 04:25:02.186
OF ALL IT DOES BACK TO TWO

04:25:02.253 --> 04:25:03.387
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

04:25:03.454 --> 04:25:05.689
THAT THAT GET AWAY DOZENS AT

04:25:05.756 --> 04:25:06.690
TO WHERE THEY'VE CHANGED A LOT

04:25:06.757 --> 04:25:08.726
BUT THAT'S ALSO BASED ON THAT

04:25:08.792 --> 04:25:09.994
THE REPORTED COSTS BUT WHAT

04:25:10.060 --> 04:25:11.562
I'M SUGGESTING IS IF WE WANT

04:25:11.629 --> 04:25:13.397
TO GET MORE MONEY INTO SALARIES

04:25:13.464 --> 04:25:15.266
AND WAGES THIS IS THE WAY TO

04:25:15.332 --> 04:25:16.967
DO IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW -- AND

04:25:17.034 --> 04:25:18.335
IS MISS AMERICA THINK DESCRIBED

04:25:18.402 --> 04:25:21.005
ACCURATELY THEY THE THERE IS

04:25:21.071 --> 04:25:22.806
A CONSTRAINT ON ON ALL OF THIS

04:25:22.873 --> 04:25:24.308
THAT THEY CAN PAY UP TO NINETY

04:25:24.375 --> 04:25:25.609
FIVE PERCENT BUT THAT DOESN'T

04:25:25.676 --> 04:25:26.810
MEAN THEY HAVE MORE MONEY IN

04:25:26.877 --> 04:25:28.912
THEIR BASED HEY IT JUST MEANS

04:25:28.979 --> 04:25:30.347
THAT THEY THAT THAT THAT'S AN

04:25:30.414 --> 04:25:32.283
ELIGIBLE AREA WHERE THEY CAN

04:25:32.349 --> 04:25:34.318
REIMBURSE THAT AREA VERSUS

04:25:34.385 --> 04:25:35.919
ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATION

04:25:35.986 --> 04:25:37.354
THEY CAN ONLY PAY UP TO THE

04:25:37.421 --> 04:25:39.590
FIFTIETH PERCENTILE SO EVEN

04:25:39.657 --> 04:25:41.058
EVEN BEING DOING EVEN DOING

04:25:41.125 --> 04:25:42.059
THAT DOESN'T GET THE MANY

04:25:42.126 --> 04:25:45.129
MORE MONEY TO PAY ITS THE REAL

04:25:45.195 --> 04:25:46.530
BUDGETARY CONSTRAINT IS WHAT

04:25:46.597 --> 04:25:48.732
THE ANNUAL INCREASE IS ANNUAL

04:25:48.799 --> 04:25:50.601
PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN IN THE

04:25:50.668 --> 04:25:54.705
RATES OF THE RATES ARE GOT IT

04:25:55.506 --> 04:25:56.774
AND THEN JUST COME BACK TO MISS

04:25:56.840 --> 04:25:58.342
MISTER GRIMACES MS HARRINGTON

04:25:58.409 --> 04:26:01.145
YOU -- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING

04:26:01.211 --> 04:26:02.479
IS NONPROFIT TO ABOUT TEN

04:26:02.546 --> 04:26:04.348
PERCENT OF THE TWELVE HUNDRED

04:26:04.415 --> 04:26:06.383
-- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

04:26:06.450 --> 04:26:08.652
A DAY OVER ALL HAVE PERFORMED

04:26:08.719 --> 04:26:10.354
BETTER THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

04:26:10.421 --> 04:26:12.489
PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

04:26:12.556 --> 04:26:14.625
DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK AS TO

04:26:14.692 --> 04:26:16.894
WHY THAT MAY BE THE CASE IS THE

04:26:16.960 --> 04:26:20.130
POPULATION IS AT THE RESOURCES

04:26:20.197 --> 04:26:22.533
WORK WORKED -- IF ANYTHING DO

04:26:22.599 --> 04:26:25.502
YOU THINK IS IS THE DIFFERENCE

04:26:25.569 --> 04:26:27.171
SO SOME OF THE LEAST FROM THE

04:26:27.237 --> 04:26:28.238
RESEARCH I'VE SEEN SOME OF

04:26:28.305 --> 04:26:30.741
THE POOREST PERFORMING -- OF

04:26:30.808 --> 04:26:33.010
FACILITIES IN THE FOR PROFIT

04:26:33.077 --> 04:26:34.712
-- WORLD ARE ACTUALLY ARE

04:26:34.778 --> 04:26:37.214
SMALLER -- FACILITIES NOT ARE

04:26:37.281 --> 04:26:39.850
LARGE CORPORATIONS AND -- WE

04:26:39.917 --> 04:26:41.518
BELIEVE FIVE BEST GUESS FROM

04:26:41.585 --> 04:26:42.619
WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

04:26:42.686 --> 04:26:45.289
EARLY RESEARCH IS THAT THERE

04:26:45.356 --> 04:26:47.991
THEY'D LACKS THE ABILITY TO --

04:26:48.058 --> 04:26:49.660
IF YOU'RE A SMALL MOM AND POP

04:26:49.727 --> 04:26:52.329
SMALL BUSINESS -- BUT WHO WAS

04:26:52.396 --> 04:26:53.897
IMPACTED BY COPA PARTICULARLY

04:26:53.964 --> 04:26:56.066
IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL AREA I'M

04:26:56.133 --> 04:26:58.369
YOU MAY LACK -- EVEN RESOURCES

04:26:58.435 --> 04:26:59.636
WITHIN YOUR COUNTY OR YOUR

04:26:59.703 --> 04:27:02.439
REGION OR YOU MAY LACKS THE

04:27:02.506 --> 04:27:04.174
STAFFING THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE

04:27:04.241 --> 04:27:05.576
ABLE TO GO OUT AND LEVERAGE

04:27:05.642 --> 04:27:08.145
AND TRY TO FIND AN ADDITIONAL

04:27:08.212 --> 04:27:09.847
-- STAFFING CONTRACTS THAT ARE

04:27:09.913 --> 04:27:11.915
OUTSIDE OF YOUR AREAS BUT AT

04:27:11.982 --> 04:27:13.217
LEAST THAT'S FROM WHAT I'VE

04:27:13.283 --> 04:27:14.651
SEEN FROM FROM THE RESEARCH

04:27:14.718 --> 04:27:15.953
FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

04:27:16.019 --> 04:27:18.021
SO FAR I'M I DO WANT TO MAKE

04:27:18.088 --> 04:27:19.356
A COMMENT ABOUT STAFFING IN

04:27:19.423 --> 04:27:20.691
GENERAL SINCE IT'S BEEN SUCH

04:27:20.758 --> 04:27:22.426
A HUGE TOPIC IT IS SUCH A ROOT

04:27:22.493 --> 04:27:25.229
CAUSE -- OF QUALITY AND SAFETY

04:27:25.295 --> 04:27:27.064
IN A FACILITY AND THAT'S THAT

04:27:27.131 --> 04:27:29.166
I AGREE WITH THE COLE HOW ON

04:27:29.233 --> 04:27:30.501
AND SOME OTHER PANELISTS HERE

04:27:30.567 --> 04:27:32.035
THAT THIS IS REALLY A MULTI

04:27:32.102 --> 04:27:34.738
PRONG -- MULTI SECTORAL ISSUE

04:27:34.805 --> 04:27:36.807
IT'S BOTH CULTURAL IT'S NOT

04:27:36.874 --> 04:27:39.009
JUST I MEAN YES WAGES RF AND

04:27:39.076 --> 04:27:40.911
MAJOR MAJOR FACTOR BUT I THINK

04:27:40.978 --> 04:27:42.846
THE ISSUES RUN DEEPER THAN THAT

04:27:42.913 --> 04:27:45.482
AND SEE THEIR FOR THE SOLUTIONS

04:27:45.549 --> 04:27:46.917
NEED TO BE BROADER THAN THAT

04:27:46.984 --> 04:27:48.285
AND AS I SAID BEFORE BREAKING

04:27:48.352 --> 04:27:49.586
IT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

04:27:49.653 --> 04:27:50.854
AND I REALLY LIKE THE WHOLE

04:27:50.921 --> 04:27:52.423
HOUSE YOU KNOW -- COMMENTS

04:27:52.489 --> 04:27:54.358
ABOUT YOU KNOW EVEN STARTING AS

04:27:55.726 --> 04:27:56.326
K.

04:27:56.393 --> 04:27:57.428
THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION HAVING

04:27:57.494 --> 04:27:59.229
FOLK AND PROGRAMS AND AND

04:27:59.296 --> 04:28:01.031
THINGS OF THAT NATURE PRIOR TO

04:28:01.098 --> 04:28:02.966
MY POSITION HERE IN CALIFORNIA

04:28:03.033 --> 04:28:04.968
I WAS WORKING ABROAD IN EUROPE

04:28:05.035 --> 04:28:06.437
WHERE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:28:06.503 --> 04:28:08.172
SEE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS

04:28:08.238 --> 04:28:10.741
THAT THE ADDRESS -- A CULTURAL

04:28:10.808 --> 04:28:12.543
AND GENERATIONS AND MIXING THEM

04:28:12.609 --> 04:28:14.411
TOGETHER HAVING KINDERGARTEN

04:28:14.478 --> 04:28:15.446
NEXT TO SKILLED NURSING

04:28:15.512 --> 04:28:17.581
FACILITIES HAVING -- COLLEGE

04:28:17.648 --> 04:28:18.816
STUDENTS HAVE FREE ROOM AND

04:28:18.882 --> 04:28:20.150
BOARD IF THEY WORK IN A SKILLED

04:28:20.217 --> 04:28:22.019
NURSING FACILITY JUST A VARIETY

04:28:22.085 --> 04:28:23.120
OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT

04:28:23.187 --> 04:28:26.123
WE CAN LEARN FROM -- BOTH -- IN
