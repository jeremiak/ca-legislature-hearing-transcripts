ATHLETE ALLY THE HOME STRETCH FOUNDATION SURF CLUB OF THE CLAREMONT COLLEGES BECAUSE I PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS. ON THE WATERFRONT. I A P. FILMS GOOD FILM WORKS AND DOCTOR MERRY LORRAINE S. A. B. FOUR SIX SEVEN DOES NOT PROTECT ATHLETES FROM GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION -- PLEASE SEE OUR RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT AND PLEASE AMEND AB FOUR SIX SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO OPPOSE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NO FILE FILE. ON THIS COURT. YES I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SURFING -- IN PARTICULAR -- PERHAPS THE OPPOSITION CAN'T TELL ME WHAT THEIR CONCERN IS BRIEFLY. THANK YOU -- SO WE HAVE TWO CONCERNS ONE CONCERN IS THAT THE BILL DOES NOT -- PROTECT. ATHLETES FROM GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS ON STATE LANDS TO CONTINUE. THAT DO NOT INCLUDE. CATEGORIES FOR MEN IN CATEGORIES FOR WOMEN MEANING THAT YOU CAN HAVE A SURF COMPETITION OR SAY -- A BICYCLE RACE OR SOME OTHER KIND OF ATHLETIC COMPETITION THAT ONLY HAS -- ATHLETES OF ONE GENDER COMPETING THEREFORE BECAUSE THE BILL HASN'T CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE THIS BILL DOES NOT. PROVIDE -- A SOLUTION FOR GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ONE GENDERED ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS TO CONTINUE ON STATE LANDS. THAT'S WHY WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THE OTHER THING THAT THE BILL DOESN'T DO YOU. IS IT DOESN'T REQUIRE PARITY AND THE LENGTH OF A COMPETITIVE COMPETITIVE EVENTS IN MAY THE AMGEN TOUR WHICH IS A A A CYCLING RACE THAT GOES THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF CALIFORNIA. IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE THE WOMEN CYCLE LISTS HAVE A WOMEN'S RACE AND THURMOND CYCLISTS HAVE A MEN'S RACE THEIR TWO CORRESPONDING RACES. THE WOMEN GET THREE DAYS TO COMPETE THE MEN GET SEVEN DAYS TO COMPETE. THIS SORT OF IN EQUITY IS GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION AND THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE AMENDED TO CORRECT THAT SITUATION THE AMGEN TOUR TAKES PLACE ON STATE ROAD WAYS. SO WE'RE SEEKING TO GET THOSE THINGS CORRECTED OKAY THANK YOU. YEAH I JUST WANT TO KIND OF REMIND EVERYONE THIS IS A FISCAL COMMITTEE THAT WAS POLICY. WE SHOULD DISCUSS THAT COMPONENT IN THE POLICIES SECTION. WITHIN ENTERTAINMENT SO JUST BRING IT BACK MY FAULT. NO NO NO PROMISED QUIRK THAT WAS OF THE GENERAL QUESTION BUT AYE AYES. WE WERE GETTING A LITTLE BIT STRETCHED OUTSIDE. SO BRAIN BACK OR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW I JUST WANTED TO GIVE BECAUSE WE DID DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT OF POLICY I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS SPECIALLY FOLKS THAT ARE WATCHING. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL ON IT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ON AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY -- THIS DID PASSED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF POLICY COMMITTEE THIS BILL FOCUSES ONLY ON EQUAL COMPENSATION PRIZES FOR MALE FEMALE ATHLTES. IT DOES NOT TALK ABOUT INCLUSION AND IS SILENT ON THAT ISSUE AND THE REASON IS THERE'S A GREAT DISPARITY ON THE INCLUSION. ISSUE AND SO WHAT I'VE TALKED WITH WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE CHAIR FOR WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE IS. WILL PERHAPS HAVE A HEARING IN THE FALL TO ACTUALLY DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF INCLUSION WHICH IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THE COMPENSATION PRIZE -- COMPONENT THIS BILL IT WAS BASED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATE LANDS DECISION THAT REQUIRED -- EQUAL COMPENSATION PRICES FOR MEN AND WOMEN AND SO WITH THIS IS A THAT ONE FOCUS OF THIS BILL I HEAR THE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION -- BUT THIS BILL HAS BEEN -- ESSENTIALLY THE SAME FORMS OF THIS WAS INTRODUCED SO -- BECAUSE IT PASSED TO POLICY COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY -- AND IS THE FISCAL COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

IN OPPOSITION -- THIS BILL SEEKS TO DOUBLE THE DEROSE V. FOR FARM TRANSFERS -- THAT'S ONLY A PORTION OF FEE THAT FARM OWNERS PAY UPON THE TRANSFER OF FIREARM IT'S CURRENTLY -- AND NINETEEN DOLLARS THIS LOOKS TO DOUBLE THAT THE WE SEEM TO DRAW SEE A MASS. SURPLUS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S BEEN BORROWED FOR OTHER OTHER PROGRAMS. AND AS MORE -- SO -- MORE STRANGE BEEN PUT ON THIS PROGRAM TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS IT'S GONE -- TO A PLACE WHERE IT'S SAFE GOING TO BE INSOLVENT AND THIS IS PUTTING THE FEEDBACK ON GUN OWNERS AS WELL AS AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS FOR MANY MANY MORE ACTIVITIES -- I THINK BEFORE WE START WRITING A BLANK CHECK OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO RAISE THE FEE ON GUN OWNERS. WE SHOULD -- EXAMINE THAT AROSE ACCOUNT AND SEE WHERE THOSE MONIES ARE GOING -- WE KNOW THAT AT ONE TIME -- TWENTY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS BORROWED FROM THAT ACCOUNT. I MEAN THAT WAS AT A TIME WHEN I WAS A MASSIVE HIT SURPLUS WERE GUN SALES ARE HALF OF WHAT THEY ARE TODAY FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN. GOOD SALES -- SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS PER YEAR INCLUDING -- THERE'S ONE POINT THREE MILLION% FARM SOLD IN A TWENTY SIXTEEN SO -- WORDS THAT MONEY GOING I THINK WE NEED -- TO TAKE. A REALLY CLOSE LOOK AT THAT BEFORE WE AUTHORIZE -- MORE MONEY THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KATHY LYNCH REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION OUTDOOR SPORTS WAS COALITION SPARKLE OF INTERNATIONAL CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY. WE'RE ALL IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- MYSTERIES I THINK COVERED IT REAL WELL -- I DID I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THERE IS -- BUDGET AUGMENTATION THIS YEAR FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S UNDERGOING BUDGET DISCUSSIONS WE THINK THAT'S THE PROPER VENUE THIS DOES CREATE A BLANK CHECK.

A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PLUS HAVE GONE INTO THE DRAWS FUND. WHERE HAVE THOSE RESOURCES GONE WE DO KNOW THAT EVERY TIME A BILL COMES FORWARD -- HAVING TO DO WITH -- SOME SORT OF GUN ISSUE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE-- IT'S ALWAYS MINOR IN OBSERVABLE. AS WAS POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUES THE DROSE FUND HAS GONE FROM. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SURPLUS TO DOWNLOAD TO TO MORE AND MORE WITH NO IDENTIFICATION AS TO WHERE THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT. THERE HAVE BEEN REQUESTS. FOR AN AUDIT TO FIND OUT HOW WILL THOSE RESOURCES ARE BEING SPENT. WHICH AGENCIES OR THE GOVERNOR OR THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BORROWED FROM THAT FUN AND AND WHEN YOU BORROW. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PAY IT BACK. AND IN THE LEE FULL INTENTION OF THIS LAW WAS ALWAYS TO COVER CERTAIN COST AND WHEN IT. WENT INTO SURPLUS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO LOWER THOSE FEES IN ORDER TO COVER THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE. COSTS SO IT'S IT'S NO LONGER A FEE BUT IT IS A TAX TO COVER. ALL MANNER OF THINGS UNRELATED TO THE TO THE PURCHASE AND REGISTRATION AND BACKGROUND CHECKS -- FOR FOR FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BOY.
