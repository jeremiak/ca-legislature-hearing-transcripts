UNDER SKINNER. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM. PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. SB EIGHTY SIX IS A SOME TECHNICAL CLEAN UP TO OUR GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS BILL AND OUR PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES TRAILER BILL WHICH WAS ONE THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS THAT AS WE HAD TO PASSED IN THAT ORIGINAL BILL WE WERE INTO OUR INTENTION WAS TO PROVIDE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS STIMULUS PAYMENTS TO R. S. S. I. N. S. S. P. RECIPIENTS. AND WHAT THIS BILL pFIX TO ENABLE US THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT- WE ALSO IN THIS BILL EXEMPTS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FROM REQUIREMENTS TO CONTRACT. WITH THE U. S. SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO ISSUE THAT ONE TIME INCREASE TO OUR SS SINUSES P. RECIPIENTS. THESE CHANGES RESOLVE ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS AND ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT AS I MENTIONED TO BE ABLE TO PROMPTLY ISSUE THOSE PAYMENTS. THE BILL ALSO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO HELP IMPLEMENTED BARCODE NINETEEN SUPPORTS IN OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. AND IT APPROPRIATES ONE POINT TWO MILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO FOSTER CARE PLACEMENTS WHILE WE ARE INTO THIS CODE NINETEEN EMERGENCY AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER MEMBERS IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING CENTER NIELSEN BUT PRESENT LAYS ON THE SENATE THIS PARTICULAR BILL I THINK IS OKAY BUT TAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REST OF THE BUDGET I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH OTHER BILLS AS A CRUISE SHIP THEY HAD.

SENATE BILL NINETY THREE BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW. AFTER LEADING TO EMPLOYMENT AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I'M- PLEASED TO BRING YOU AB. SB NINETY THREE WHICH WAS HEARD IN BUDGET COMMITTEE ON- THIS PAST MONDAY AND- WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ANNOUNCED THAT- THE VIRUS THE CODE NINETEEN BEHAVING. THAT WE WILL HAVE A KANEMI WIDE OPENING BY JUNE FIFTEENTH WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE SECTORS THAT WERE COMPLETELY CLOSED DUE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC WILL BE RE OPENING. THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR SO JOBS IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY. CONVENTION CENTERS AIRPORTS AND SUCH WAS THE SECTOR THAT LOST THE MOST JOBS. DUE TO THE NEED TO CLOSE FACILITIES DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THOSE JOBS ARE NOW BEGINNING TO BE RESTORED. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOW FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO HAD WORKED FOR THE FACILITY FOR A MINIMUM OF SIX MONTHS. TO BE INFORMED BY THEIR EMPLOYER THAT THEY ARE RE HIRING THE EMPLOYEE THEN HAS FIVE DAYS TO RESPOND SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE BACK THE JOB THAT THEY HAD SO IT IS NOT THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO ANY JOB AT THE FACILITY. AND IT IS NOT FOR ANY PAST EMPLOYEE IS ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO WERE LAID OFF DUE TO THIS COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ADDITIONALLY THE PROVISIONS ONLY APPLY TO HOTELS WITH MORE THAN FIFTY GUEST ROOMS LARGE CONVENTION CENTERS WITH MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND SEATS AIRPORTS AND BUILDING SERVICES FOR COMMERCIAL. BUILDINGS THE ENFORCEMENT IS EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. AND THERE IS NO PRIVATE ACTION RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS BILL ADITIONALLY THESE PROVISIONS SUNSET ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. NOW IF AND- THOSE OF US WHO PAID ATTENTION TO THE- LOSS OF JOBS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE SUBSEQUENT WHAT THE SUBSEQUENT A CIRCUMSTANCE WAS FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO LOST JOBS THE OLDER YOU WERE WHEN YOU LOST THAT JOB AND THE LONGER YOU WERE OUT OF A JOB SO IF YOU WERE OUT OF A JOB FOR A YEAR OR MORE. AND OVER AGE FORTY FIVE YOUR LIKELIHOOD TO RETURN TO FULL EMPLOYMENT BECAME LOWER WITH EACH YEAR OF YOUR AGE AND YOUR LIFE AND YOUR ABILITY TO GET RE HIRED WENT FROM IF YOU LOOK AT EVERYONE FROM EIGHT UNDER AGE FORTY FIVE THEIR AVERAGE ABILITY GET REHIRED WAS WITHIN TWENTY WEEKS. FOR THOSE WHO ARE OLDER WORKERS IT WAS A YEAR AND LONGER ON AVERAGE. WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE AS THE ECONOMY REOPENS WE HAVE. OLDER WORKERS WHO ARE CLOSER TO RETIREMENT AND WHO THEN WOULD BE MORE DEPENDENT ON OUR SAFETY NET IF THEY ARE NOT RE EMPLOYED. TO BE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THEY STAY PERMANENTLY UNEMPLOYED. THE AB OR SB NINETY THREE ALSO APPROPRIATE SIX MILLION FROM THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR STAFFING RESOURCES. AND- LASTLY I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT ADDITIONALLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE DATA ON WHO LOST JOBS IN THIS SECTOR IT WAS LARGELY WOMEN AND IF WE LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT UNEMPLOYMENT A LAYOFF NUMBERS WOMEN WERE. LOST MORE JOBS AND LEFT THE WORK FORCE IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN MEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC RECESSION SO YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT THIS BILL IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO GET WOMEN BACK INTO THE WORK FORCE. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT IF I MAY NOT POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR SANDERS CAN WE TAKE A QUESTION. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER FOLKS THAT HAVE A NUMBER OF PROCEDURAL CONCERNS THAT THIS IS A POLICY BILL- IN THE MIDST OF A- CALL BUDGET BILL BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. WHEN YOU HAVE BUSINESSES THAT ARE SEEKING TO RE OPEN. I KNOW THERE'S A NATURAL INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO WANT TO RE HIRE- FROM THEIR PREVIOUS TALENT POOL. I THINK THE INCLINATION IS WHAT IS ALREADY THERE. BUT ONE OF THE CONCERN I HAVE. IS THAT. IF THIS IS BASED ON SENIORITY THE REHIRING IS BASED ON SENIORITY. WHAT IF THE WHAT IS THE BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE WANTED TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN VACCINATED. FIVE SO HOW WOULD THAT FIT INTO A PRIORITY LIST- WITH A BILL LIKE THIS. CENTER SKINNER THANK YOU THREE HIRING THE TERM SENIORITY YES THIS IS IN THE PROVISIONS HOWEVER. THE EMPLOYEE THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR RE HIRE MUST BE AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD THAT JOB WE'RE VERY COMPARABLE JOB AND WORKED FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS SO THEY A EMPLOYEE WITH QUOTE UNQUOTE SENIORITY. FIFTY FIFTY SECTOR THAT THIS AFFECTS. MUCH THREE HIGHER IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF JOB. SOMEONE WITH SENIORITY IN A NOTHER JOB DOES NOT GET THE JOB SO I WANTED TO JUST BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A BLANKET REQUIRED ANYONE WHO WAS LAID OFF BUT RATHER IT MUST BE WITHIN THE JOB CATEGORY. THAT THE PERSON HAD. BUT THAT IS MADAM PRESIDENT I MAY REAFFIRM I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHAT IF THE EMPLOYER WISH TO IMPLEMENT A POLICY ON PUBLIC HEALTH GROUNDS THAT THE PREFERENCE IS THAT EMPLOYEES AT A REHIRE OR THOSE WHO ARE VACCINATED. HOW DOES THAT JIVE WITH. THE SENIORITY POLICY LIKE THIS. CENTERS AND- PROVISION REGARDING THE EITHER REQUIREMENT OR PREFERENCE REGARDING VACCINATIONS AND- IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT EVEN IF THIS WERE ADDRESS THAT THAT WOULD BE LEGALLY IF WE WOULD BE LEGALLY ABLE TO DO SO- AND I WILL DEFINITELY. GET STAFF TO LOOK INTO THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THAT WHICH I CANNOT SPEAK TO AS I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU BUY I THINK THERE ARE ISSUES REDUCE RELATED TO THE LEGALITY OF SUCH A REQUIREMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER BOARD JUSTICE CENTER NIELSEN. BERMAN PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE SENATE I URGE A NO VOTE. THIS IS. USING THE ACCESS TO THE POLICIES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ADMINISTRATION IN FACT IN DEALING WITH THE CULVERT SITUATION AND THE DEVASTATION TO SMALL BUSINESSES. A CAREER IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. THAT WAS CONCERTED EFFORT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER BY THIS ADMINISTRATION IT WAS. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SAY PAY THE PRICE AND LIKE MAKING A HOLE ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS THAT WERE DISPLACED BY ACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND VERY MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN YOUR DISTRICTS WHO WILL SAY OH BOY THIS IS A GREAT DEAL I WANT TO BRING ALL MY EMPLOYEES BACK THAT'S THE GUY'S IN THERE FOR FOOLISH. THE TEMPTATION OF THIS LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT IT IT'S GOING TO SUNSET. BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN COME SUNSET TAX. I THINK THIS IS A RUSE AND I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I JUST PRO THE QUESTION THAT THE SENATOR FROM FRESNO ASKED I CAN ANSWER I ACTUALLY EMPLOY PEOPLE YOU CANNOT ASK. AN EMPLOYEE WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN VACCINATED OR NOT THERE'S HIPAA LAWS THERE'S SO MANY LAWS THAT ARE PROTECT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF A PERSON TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR MEDICAL INFORMATION PRIVATE AND SO THIS BILL DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO THAT SO FOR I JUST WANTED TO HELP ANSWER THAT QUESTION I'M AN EMPLOYER I KNOW THE LAW. AND THE LAW SAYS THAT YOU CAN ASK WHEN YOU POISON YOU CAN'T USE THAT AS A HIRING A COOK- DETERMINATION EITHER IT'S DISCRIMINATION SO I JUST WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY. CENTER ROTH. THANK YOU- YOUR MANTRA JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM. FRESNO I THINK WAS ANSWERED YOU KNOW- THIS RECALL PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING ON VARIETY OF SETTINGS WITH THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD WHEN WE BROUGHT EMPLOYEES BACK FROM STRIKES. PRIVATE EMPLOYERS WHEN THEIR STRIKE ISSUES WHEN THEIR LAYOFF ISSUES THIS THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY FOLLOWS THAT SAME PROCEDURE. THERE'S SOME. PROCESS ISSUES THAT WILL NEED TO BE SORTED THROUGH BETWEEN NOW AND THE TIME THAT WE- BUT ON OUR LAST CLEAN OF BILLS THAT ARE RELATIVELY MINOR BUT ARE OF CONCERN TO BUSINESS. AS TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTION IS THE VACCINES. THE EMPLOYERS RUN THE RECALL LIST BUT THE VACCINE ISSUE IS A SEPARATE ISSUE AND IF AN EMPLOYEE OF A PRIVATE EMPLOYER. UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES WANTS TO IMPOSE A MANDATORY VACCINE RULE FOR ITS WORKFORCE. SHAMING THE LAW CONTINUES TO PERMIT THAT THE EMPLOYER IMPOSES A MATTER MANDATORY VACCINE REQUIREMENTS EMPLOYEES WHO ACCEPTED RECALL. MAY OR MAY NOT MEET THAT TEST. AND THEN THEY DROP OUT IN THE EMPLOYER FILLS A POSITION SO THAT'S HOW. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE THE VACCINE ISSUE AND THE MANDATORY IMPOSITION OF A VACCINE RULE. INTERSECTS WITH THIS RECALL FROM LAYOFF POLICY HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU CENTER ROBSON CENTER PAM NO VERY GOOD ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK. SEEING AND HEARING THAT SENATOR SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF. THAT IS RAPE AND RAISED A NUMBER OF TIMES ABOUT. WHETHER THIS IS APPROPRIATE BUDGET ACTION AND IF WE LOOK AT THE ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAKING SINCE JANUARY. THAT ARE IMMEDIATE RESPONSES TO OUR COVERED NINETEEN. PANDEMIC IN CRISIS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS NEVER PROVIDED DIRECTIONLESS GRANTS BEFORE TO- CERTAIN OF ITS- CATEGORY OF RESIDENTS NOR IS IT A- PROVIDED THEM FOR EXAMPLE TESSA SINUSES P. RECIPIENTS- THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN THAT WORD BUDGETARY TO RESPOND TO THE CRISIS THAT WERE TIME SENSITIVE AND URGENT AND THIS IS ADDITIONALLY ONE OF THOSE BECAUSE- THE PANDEMIC CLOSURES WERE. IMPOSED TO DO A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SO FOLKS WERE LAID OFF DUE TO THAT AND WE ARE THE BUDGETARY ASPECT IS BOTH TO RESPOND TO THE FACT THAT OUR GOVERNOR HAS. LEGITIMATELY ANNOUNCED THE RE PENING OF THE ECONOMY AND THAT ADDITIONALLY THIS IS A SECTOR THAT. LOST SOME OF THE GREATEST NUMBER OF WORKERS AND THE DIVISION. WE HAVE MADE SOME CHANGES TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS RE HIRING THAT THERE IS ENFORCEMENT SOLELY AND ONLY UNDER THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- DIVISION IN WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.
