CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY I

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:53.318
EXPERIENCE THIS WHEN I WENT TO

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:53.852
COLLEGE --

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:54.720
MY BEST FRIEND WHO WAS A

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:56.922
ROOMMATE ROOMMATE WITH HE HAD A

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:57.956
SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT HIS PARENTS

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:59.358
A SET UP FOR HIM.

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:01.793
I WASN'T ABLE TO DO THAT I WORK

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.095
THREE DIFFERENT JOBS WHILE ALSO

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:04.963
GOING TO SCHOOL FULL TIME THERE

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.431
WAS JUST A MAJOR DIFFERENCE AND

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:07.799
NOT NECESSARILY ACADEMIC

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:08.533
ACTIVITY BUT IN ACTUAL

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.735
CURRICULAR STUFF AND BEING ABLE

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.478
BETTER OFFER HAVE THEY ARE LEVEL

COLLEGE BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.729
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:38.730

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:39.665

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:38.403
IN SAYING --

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:41.272
ON THIS MEASURE WE HISTORICALLY

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:41.539
OPPOSED --

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:42.874
TAX --

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:45.109
INCENTIVES OF THIS NATURE AB YOU

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:47.178
KNOW IF YOU IF YOU REFLECT ON

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:49.414
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND THE

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.583
SKYROCKETING COSTS OF CS USING

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:53.017
UC'S IN THE STATE.

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:54.586
I THINK IT WAS A PP I SEE REPORT

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.020
SAID THAT THEY'VE TRIPLED OVER

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:57.589
JUST THE LAST TEN YEARS ALONE

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:58.823
AND SO THERE IS A LARGER.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.525
QUESTION TO BE ASKING ABOUT THE

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:02.493
IMPACT OF REDUCING REVENUE TO

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.095
THE STATE ON KID FOR FOURTEEN AS

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:04.896
WELL AS FUNDS THAT WOULD

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:06.698
OTHERWISE GO INTO THE CSU WHEN

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:09.367
YOU SEE SYSTEM THAT'S MAKING IT

00:31:09.434 --> 00:31:10.568
MORE AFFORDABLE --

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:12.070
WE DO AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT

00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:13.171
WAS SAID IN THE ANALYSIS IN

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.106
PARTICULAR THAT THIS TYPE OF

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:16.407
INCENTIVE REALLY DOES FAVOR

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:18.009
PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO SAVE I

00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:20.211
BELIEVE THE MEDIUM MEDIAN INCOME.

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:21.279
OF THOSE WHO ACTUALLY TAKE

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:22.380
ADVANTAGE OF THESE TYPES OF

00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:24.349
ACCOUNTS IS AROUND A HUNDRED AND

00:31:24.415 --> 00:31:24.916
FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:27.418
YEAR WITH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:28.686
FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.021
ASSETS AGAIN THAT'S ON MEDIAN

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.589
AND AS SOMEONE WHO IS A JUNIOR

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:32.690
IN HIGH SCHOOL --

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:34.425
AND FALLS PRETTY SQUARELY WITHIN

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.027
THAT CATEGORY I CAN TELL YOU I

00:31:36.094 --> 00:31:37.095
WOULD NOT BE MORE OR LESS

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:39.130
MOTIVATED TO SAVE UNFORTUNATELY.

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:40.632
BASED ON THIS AND AND THE REASON

00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:42.834
IS IS THAT AN OVERWHELMING 68%

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:43.935
OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN SURVEYED

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:46.004
ABOUT THEIR LACK OF USE A FIVE

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.471
TWENTY NINE ACCOUNTS.

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:47.605
HAVE ACTUALLY SAID THAT THEY

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:49.140
JUST SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:49.907
TO SAVE.

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.242
AND AND SO THAT BECOMES A HUGE

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:55.380
YOU ABILITY AT C. T. R. A. AN

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:56.481

00:31:57.515 --> 00:31:59.050
COMMUNITY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PART

00:31:59.117 --> 00:32:00.952
OF A LARGER COALITION. TO LOOK

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.120
AT SOME OF THE DECISIONS HAVE

00:32:02.186 --> 00:32:03.821

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:06.090
CONVERSATIONS.

00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:07.558
BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS A LARGER

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:08.860
CONVERSATION WE HAD ABOUT STATES

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.495

ON THE DOLLAR INCOME TOOK I WANT

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:18.436

FOLKS THAT COULD GIVE FIFTY OR A

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:35.639
THAT WE ARE WANTING ONLY SEVEN

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:36.974

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:29.119
SO THE WHITE BUT OF HOME.

00:46:29.186 --> 00:46:29.720
OKAY AGAIN.

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:30.554
SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT ON BEHALF

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.155
OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:32.122
ASSOCIATION I DON'T WANNA

BELIEVER THE COMMITTEE WITH

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:33.290
SIMILAR POINTS BECAUSE I THINK

00:46:33.357 --> 00:46:33.924
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AS SORT

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:34.558
OF SIMILAR HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:35.125
IN TERMS OF WHAT'S THE BEST

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:35.626
BENEFIT FOR THE STATE.

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:36.059
I WILL SAY THAT --

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:36.860
IN REGARDS TO THIS SIMILAR TO

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.095
THE LAST MEASURE THERE IS AT WE

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:39.029
DO DEEPLY HAVE CONCERNS BOTH IN

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.130
REGARDS TO THE REDUCTION OF A

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:41.031
FUNDING TO THE STATE AND OTHER

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:42.266
VITAL PROGRAMS INCLUDING OF

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:42.900
COURSE K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION.

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.536
BUT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS OF

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:48.372
PAYING DOWN STUDENT DEBT --

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:51.341
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILIES TO

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:52.476
PURCHASE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:53.844
ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO CONSIDER

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:55.078
CAPPING IN ALLOCATING THOSE

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.613
AMOUNTS SPECIFICALLY SO NOT JUST

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.081
TARGETING THEM TO THE

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.283
POPULATIONS WHO NEED THEM THE

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:01.251
MOST BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT.

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.486
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST AN

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:04.388
UNKNOWN AMOUNT OF FUNDING GOING

00:47:04.454 --> 00:47:06.156

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:20.704
ON THE RECORD WE HAVE

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.846
THANK YOU PLEASE.

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:30.347
THE NEXT.

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:36.420
MOVING TO FILE AND THREE AB. ONE

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:37.020
FIFTY THREE ONE FIFTY THREE IT

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:37.254
WOULD.

00:47:37.321 --> 00:47:39.156
INCREASE A TAX DEDUCTION FOR

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:40.824
FAMILIES WHO HOST FOREIGN

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.695
TWELVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:46.330
SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:48.098
THESE FAMILIES OPENER HOMES TO

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:49.666
HOUSE THESE STUDENTS AND RECEIVE

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:52.002
COMPENSATION FOR THEIR EFFORTS

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:53.737

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:57.174
BLINDSIDED BY TAXES ON EXTRA

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.141

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.225
FAMILY HOLES.

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:16.493
THE WORST PART OF THE ADDITIONAL

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.695
TAX IS THAT SOME FAMILIES THAT

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:20.063
PARTICIPATE DON'T EVEN KNOW

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.298
ABOUT IT.

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:22.532
AND IN THE END OF FAMILY MIGHT

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.635
END UP OWING OUT OF POCKET MONEY

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:26.670
UNDER TAX RETURNS WHICH COULD

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:29.139
ULTIMATELY HURT PARTICIPATION OF

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:31.041
THESE FAMILIES --

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:33.143
JUST ANOTHER.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.346
LITTLE THING TO HELP OUT.

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:37.547
FAMILIES THAT WANT TO HOST

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:41.885

COMMITTEE TODAY WE JUST FLATLY

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:05.709

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:06.910
POLICY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:08.445
INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE STUDENTS

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:10.614
HERE SO IRONICALLY THE PROGRAM

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:12.616
ITSELF WOULD REDUCE FUNDS FOR

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:13.250
KIDS --

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:14.017
FOURTEEN FUNDING FOR THE

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.752

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:16.520
ACTUALLY COME HERE TO BENEFIT

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:17.721
FROM -- AT A

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:18.689
TIME WHERE THE STATE IS ACTUALLY

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:20.590
LOOKING AT ADAPTING TO FEDERAL

TAX CONFORMITY EFFORTS --

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.227
MULTIPLYING BY TEN THE DEDUCTION

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:25.729
AND MOVING IN OUT OF ALIGNMENT

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.031
WITH FEDERAL THAT DEDUCTIONS WE

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:29.333
CONSIDER NOT ONLY TO BE

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:31.168
UNNECESSARY BUT AS A JUST BAD IT

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:32.536
ON ITS FACE AS A MATTER OF

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:34.071
PUBLIC POLICY AND FOR THAT LIKE

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:37.307

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:42.746
SEEING.

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:44.414
NINE THE WE ALSO HAVE

AMENDMENTS FOR THIS BILL AS WELL.

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:50.487

00:49:50.554 --> 00:49:59.262
ON TO A FILE ITEM FOR AB. ONE

00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.863
FIFTY FIVE ONE FIFTY FIVE THIS

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:00.964
MAJOR WOULD ALLOW A TAX CREDIT

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:03.633
FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO BUILD A HOME.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.168
FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING IT

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:07.804
THEIR PRINCIPAL HOME.

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.005
IT'S A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

00:50:09.072 --> 00:50:10.540
HOPES TO ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA

00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:12.042
HOUSING CRISIS AS WELL AS TO

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:13.477
ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS TO BUILD

00:50:13.543 --> 00:50:14.611
THEIR OWN HOME.

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:15.746
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:50:15.812 --> 00:50:16.980
CURRENTLY RANKED AMONG THE MOST

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:19.249
EXPENSIVE STATES IN THE NATION I

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:20.784
WILL GO AND ALL THE NUMBERS AND

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.819
EVERYTHING BUT WE ALL KNOW IT'S

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:25.555
HARD. TO DO ANY HOUSING IN THIS

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:28.925
STATE NO MATTER HOW RICH OR POOR

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:30.527
YOUR TO GET NEAR --

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:31.795
DUE TO RISING PRICE OF HOMES

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.430
THAT CALIFORNIA BECOMES EVEN

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:35.499
MORE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THIS

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:36.833
LEGISLATIVELY.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.102
NOW. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:41.138
QUALIFY FOR THIS TAX CREDIT

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.506
THEY'RE BUILDING COST OF THE

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.040
HOME SHOULD NOT EXCEED THREE

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:46.143
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:47.444
FURTHER INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:48.678
WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE HOME

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:50.614
THEIR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.249
THIS TAX CREDIT WILL BE APPLE

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:53.984
COLD TO A HOME BUILT BETWEEN

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.319
JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:57.687
JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO

00:50:57.754 --> 00:51:00.056
WE'RE NOT.

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:01.658
MAKING THIS PERMANENT --

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:02.893
IF IT WORKS IT WORKS IF IT

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.394
DOESN'T IT DOESN'T.

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:05.028
NOW THE REASON FOR PUTTING THAT

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:09.032
CRY TO PLACES TO MAKE IT CLEAR

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.033
TO EVERYONE.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.536
THAT THIS ISN'T TO SUPPORT LARGE

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:14.938
DEVELOPERS ARE LARGE --

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:17.340
HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS BUT RATHER

00:51:17.407 --> 00:51:19.443
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE A SMALL

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:20.710
PLOT OF LAND.

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:23.046
IN WHO BUILT A HOME ON THAT LAND

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.548
FOR THE PURPOSE OF LIVING ON IT

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:26.716
SO IT'S NOT EVEN GRANNY FLATS OR

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:28.151
ANYTHING IT SAYS.

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:31.655
BUILDING YOUR INITIAL HOME--

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:32.923
IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.524
HOUSING PROBLEMS IN OUR STATE

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:36.026
BUT I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE

00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:37.961
ANOTHER LITTLE STEP IN THE RIGHT

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.696
DIRECTION.

00:51:39.763 --> 00:51:41.965

ASSOCIATION WE HAVE MULTIPLE

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:57.347
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS MEASURE AND

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:57.848
FOR THAT REASON ARE IN

00:51:57.914 --> 00:51:58.849
OPPOSITION I THINK.

00:51:58.915 --> 00:52:00.417
COMMON TO A LOT OF OTHER BILLS

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:03.220

IF THIS WAS TARGETED FOR EXAMPLE

00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:19.236
TO I THINK IS THE ANALYSIS

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.770
POINTED OUT WILD FIRE VICTIMS OR

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.305

I KNOW YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT

00:52:28.178 --> 00:52:29.312
YOUR INTENT IS NOT TO COVER

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:30.847
LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OR

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:32.182
OTHERWISE BUT WE DO HAVE

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:33.517
CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEFINITION

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.318
SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO WHAT

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:36.586
