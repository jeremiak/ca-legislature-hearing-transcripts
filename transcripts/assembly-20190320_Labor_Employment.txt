IT'S PRETTY SYSTEMATIC AND CHANGES IN THE THIS BILL PRESENTLY ONLY ADDRESSES ACCELERATING THAT P. E. L. CHANGES. I BELIEVE THE INTENT IS TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE AREAS AND BECAUSE OF THE DRASTIC NATURE OF THOSE CHANGES THAT ARE ON THE TABLE AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DRESSED IN ALL OF THEM. I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE THE TIME TO ALLOW THE NECESSARY COMMON. BUT AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- A LEAVE THAT THERE AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. OKAY WILL BRING IT BACK.

CARILLO I DEEP. GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. THREE OF US THREE OF US I ALL RIGHT -- THANK YOU A SUMMER GONZALEZ AB. FIVE NINE OF A BILL TO GET RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN A SAN DIEGO BASED COUPLE WAS ARRESTED FOR ENSLAVING AN INDONESIAN DOMESTIC WORKER IN THEIR HOME. FORCING HER TO WORK BETWEEN SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY WITH NO PAY AND NO DAYS OFF. THE VIEWS THE VICTIM MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY BY RETAINING HER PASSPORT MAKING HER BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE PHYSICALLY HARMED IF SHE DID NOT PERFORM HER DUTIES. A TWENTY FOURTEEN URBAN INSTITUTE STATE FOUND THAT MANY VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TACTICS MEANT TO CONTROL AND ENSLAVE THE VICTIMS. INCLUDING THE USE OF DOCUMENT SERVITUDE. DOCUMENT SERVITUDE AS A PRACTICE OF AN EMPLOYER OCCUPANTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANIPULATING THE EMPLOYEE. WITH THE VAST MAJORITY LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS BEING IMMIGRANTS IT IS VITAL THAT THE CALIFORNIA PROTECT THESE WORKERS BY PREVENT TEEN UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS BIG AND SMALL FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE WORKERS IMMIGRATION STATUS. AB FIVE EIGHTY NINE TO HELP PROTECT WORKERS AGAINST THE MORE PRACTICE OF DOCUMENT SERVITUDE BY PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK TO HOLD EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE WHO ENGAGE IN DOMESTIC SERVITUDE. INDETERMINATE VIOLATION IS A MISDEMEANOR POTENTIAL TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CIVIL PENALTY. WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH WORKERS BILL RIGHT SO MUCH THE EMPLOYER MUST PROVIDE A COPY TO EVERY WORKER IN THEIR LANGUAGE OF CHOICE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. BUT WITNESSES PART SORRY. HI HI MARTIN OIL I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY -- AND THE SEX CRIMES AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING DIVISION OF THE SENATE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN. UP FEDERAL ALREADY HAS A SIMILAR PROVISION AS THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS THE NOTES WHICH PROHIBITS WITHHOLDING GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS AND PASSPORTS TO FURTHER VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW WITH RESPECT TO LABOR TRAFFICKING. EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE WOULD BE ANOTHER TOOL FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND CITY ATTORNEYS. TO COMBAT UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS WOULD SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM A HOLDING THEIR EMPLOYEES IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS AB FIVE A FIVE EIGHTY NINE WOULD PROHIBIT WITH HOLY OF IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS TO FURTHER A VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. WELL WE ALREADY HAVE A LABOR TRAFFICKING FELONY -- PENAL CODE SECTION TWO SIXTY ONE SUBDIVISION A FOR SOMEONE WHO DEPRIVE SOMEONE OF THEIR PERSONAL LIBERTY TO OBTAIN FORCED LABOR. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A MISDEMEANOR FOR WITHHOLDING DOCUMENTS DISCOURAGE SOMEONE FOR EXERCISING ANY ANY OF THEIR LABOR EMPLOYEE RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. IT WOULD ALSO INFORM EMPLOYEES MANY OF WHOM COME FROM PLACES WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE SUCH RIGHTS OF THEIR RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA. AS A PROSECUTOR I OFTEN FIND THAT VICTIMS ARE RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD. BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE LEGISLATURE BRING THESE PEOPLE OUT OF THE DARKNESS -- AND GIVING THEM ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEM BY ACTING A PRIVILEGE IN THE EVIDENCE CODE AGAINST USING SOMEBODY'S -- IMMIGRATION STATUS MERELY. FOR IMPEACHMENT PURPOSES AND ALSO THEY'VE AMENDED THE EXTORTION STATIC STATUTE TO MAKE IT SO PEOPLE CAN'T BE EXTORTED. BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS. THIS IS ANOTHER STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OF ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF A PUBLIC COMMENT ACOSTA THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU YEAH AND WE ALSO SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MITCH DYER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS RENE BAYARDO IS HERE YOU CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANDRE RIVER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. FOR ANYONE OPPOSITION. YES. HELLO AGAIN ROBERT MUTRIE -- FOR THE CAL CHAMBER WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB -- FIVE EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE WOULD BURDEN MILLIONS OF EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE ADMITTEDLY TERRIBLE ACTIONS OF A FEW -- GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO MESSAGE LAST YEAR TO A SIMILAR PASSAGE CONTAINED IN AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY TO PLAY THIS OUT. A QUOTE THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIAN PLAYERS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LABOR TRAFFICKING SO THIS MANDATE AS APPLY TO THEM IS BURDENSOME I ON WARRANTED -- AND YOU KNOW AS AN EASY EXAMPLE OF SAN DIEGO AND OTHER HIGH RISK AREAS CLEARLY ARE YOU KNOW. VERY DISTINCT FROM LET'S SAY THE TECH SECTOR IN IN SAN FRANCISCO OR A FAMILY GROCERY STORE IN REDDING OR OR EUREKA -- SO BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN TO ALL EMPLOYERS WE BELIEVE THIS IS UNWARRANTED AT THIS TIME -- ONE ADDITIONAL CONCERN WHICH WE RACE WITH STAFF -- THOUGH IT -- ABOUT THIS BILL IS THE MOST OF THE RIGHTS DELINEATED IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- THE FIRST SECOND FOURTH AND FIFTH AREN'T PROBLEMATIC THE THIRD ACTUALLY CREATES -- A RIGHT WHICH AND ALL ALL READ THE LANGUAGE TO BE PRECISE THE RIGHT TO LIVE -- IS LOOSELY THE RIGHT TO LIVE WHEREVER THE EMPLOYEE CHOOSES NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXAMPLE PROVIDED WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC -- THE EMPLOYERS CONCERN IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EMPLOYMENT SITUATIONS WHERE LIVING IN A LOCATION IS IS KEY AND CALIFORNIA WAGE ORDERS AND FEDERAL LAW RECOGNIZES SITUATIONS LIKE -- AN ONSITE APARTMENT MANAGER RIGHT WHO NEEDS TO BE AROUND BECAUSE PART OF THEIR JOB IS BEING PRESENT FOR THOSE SITUATIONS -- ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT -- AND I I'VE AGAIN WILL NOT TAKE SIX MINUTES WITH THIS BUT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WENT THROUGH WAS WORKING AS A GARDEN INDUSTRIAL PLANT IN STOCKTON WHERE HE NEEDED TO BE ON SITE THAT NIGHT OTHERWISE SOMEONE WOULD STEAL THE EQUIPMENT AND SO HE SLEPT AND STAYED. AT THAT SITE WHILE HE WAS DOING THAT JOB I DON'T BELIEVE THOSE OF THE YOU KNOW THE INTENDED CONSEQUENCE HERE BUT THE CHAMBER IS A CONCERN THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO UNINTENDED LITIGATION FOR EMPLOYERS WHO. ARE NOT REALLY THAT AIM HERE -- SO BECAUSE OF THAT BURDEN AND BECAUSE OF THAT CONCERN OVER ON INTENT LITIGATION OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS YOUR POST THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BILL GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL WELL WE APPRECIATE THE AND TEND TO THE LEGISLATION -- WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY INSTANCES OF VIOLATIONS OF OF WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN AS AN EXAMPLE -- HAPPENING WITH PUBLIC AID SUGGESTED MOMENT IS TO SIMPLY REMOVE PUBLIC AGENCIES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST OF COMPLIANCE AND RECORD KEEPING THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY. OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS OF APPLYING THIS TO PUBLIC AGENCIES AND AND SO WE'RE REQUESTING BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL THANK YOU. RIGHT LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION FOR THE REASON STATE ABOUT MY COLLEAGUE AND CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY LET ME BACK TO THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE A MOTION FROM SUMMER CARILLO SECOND BEST MOVIE BEST ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AND AND I WANT TO THANK THE SUMMER FOR BRING THIS BILL BACK AGAIN I SUPPORT IT LAST TIME I DO HAVE AN AYE RECOMMENDATION. AND JUST TO THE CONTENTION OF THIS IS ONLY A BORDER ISSUE OR AN ISSUE THAT APPLIES TO A SPECIFIC INDUSTRY I I WOULD I REALLY -- ABSOLUTE DISAGREE WITH THAT -- WE HAD OF A REALLY EGREGIOUS HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE WHERE THE HEART OF MY DISTRICT -- TOWER THAT WAS WILL CALL SILVERY TOWERS THAT WAS NICKNAMED SLAVERY TOWERS BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY ENSLAVED PEOPLE WOULD NOT LET THEM LEAVE -- BUT IT AND WE'RE NOT PAYING THEM AND IT WAS JUST A PERFECT CASE SO THAT'S ONE OF MANY MANY MANY BE SEEN IN SILICON VALLEY ACROSS A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES SO. ALTHOUGH I RESPECT THE CONCERN IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S A NET CAST TOO BROADLY THE REALITY IS THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU -- CAN REALLY LITTLE BIT OURSELVES OF THE SCOURGE THE TYPES OF MEASURES THAT YES MAYBE A FEW. EMPLOY UP TO REALLY TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES HORRIBLY BUT THIS IS NOT JUST A ONE OFF OR WHERE IT'S ONLY AFFECTING ONE SPECIFIC INDUSTRY OR ONE REGION OF OUR STATE. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S THIS KIND OF SITUATION WHERE -- YOU WANTED A PRICE A PLAY BROTHER YOU WANT PROSECUTORS TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO KEEP THEIR COMMUNITIES SAFE IN A WAY THAT THAT -- THAT THEY BELIEVE IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN SO I APPRECIATE -- HAVING -- REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DISK TRAINS ABSENTIA YEARS WELL AND WITH THAT -- ALASKA MEMBER TO CLOSE AND AGAIN I RECOMMENDATION. I JUST WANNA ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION -- AS FAR AS THE SPECIAL DECKS DISTRICTS AND NO RECORD OF A PUBLIC EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER. I'M COMMITTEE IN -- LABOR TRACK CORRECT BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK AND CHECK I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS. BELIEVE WAS WITH -- IT WAS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTRACTING WITH SOMEBODY THAT WAS DOING THAT SO WE WERE WERE WILLING TO TAILOR THE BILL TO NOT HAVE AN ONEROUS A FACT BUT THERE MIGHT BE A NEED -- FOR THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE THEIR CONTRACTING WITH ACTUALLY TO FILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LAW -- BUT I DO JUST WANT TO GO DOUBLE CHECK THAT THERE'S NO -- EXPERIENCE OF THIS HAPPENING IN SOME SMALL CITY -- AREA THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT -- IT WITH REACHED WITH REGARDS TO THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHERE YOU LIVE I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE. A SPECIFIC SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FROM THE CHAMBER THAT GETS TO THEIR VERY VERY VERY NARROW -- SITUATIONS LIKE A PROPERTY MANAGER WHOSE JOB IT IS TO LIVE ON SITE BUT THAT PROVISION IS VERY IMPORTANT -- IN IN EXPLAINING TO WORKERS -- ESPECIALLY IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO HAVE HAD THINGS TAKEN FROM AND THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE -- TWENTY PEOPLE TO AN APARTMENT -- WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE SO WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE OUT THAT PROVISION BUT IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF ACCEPTING LANGUAGE THAT THEY'D LIKE I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM ON THAT. OTHERWISE -- I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO PASSAGE ASSURED OF KALRA PLEASE. DO PASSED TO JUDICIARY KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. CARILLO. I DEEP. GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE THREE OF US THREE OF US HI. HI THE BILLS OUT SHE THE CIVIC CENTER BOB. JUST. ONE MOMENT YOUR YEAH YEAH SUBCOMMITTEE PRISTINE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER KALRA WHICH BILL WOULD YOU LIKE 2% FIRST YOU HAVE AB THIRTY FIVE IN AB FIVE TWENTY BY TWENTY PLEASE OKAY GREAT. ALL RIGHT OF YOU READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB FIVE TWENTY WHICH DEFINES WHEN A PUBLIC SUBSIDY IS DE MINIMUS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING. IF THE PREVAILING WAGE APPLIES A PRIVATE PROJECTS USING PUBLIC FUNDS. THERE'S A MOTION BY SOMEONE MEMBER GONZALEZ SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER REQUESTS. THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT A PUBLIC SUB SUBSIDY ON A PRIVATE PROJECT IS DE MINIMUS SO LONG AS IT IT IS LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND LESS THAN 2% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. UNDER CURRENT LAW PROJECT IS NOT SUBJECT PREVAILING WAGE LAW EVEN IF IT RECEIVES A PUBLIC SUBSIDY. IT THAT SUBSIDIES DE MINIMUS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT. SINCE THE TURN TO TO MINIMIZE HAS NOT DEFINED AS STATUTE THERE IS NO GUIDANCE AS TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL PUBLIC SUBSIDY THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DE MINIMUS. THIS HAS LED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL THEY RULINGS AS TO WHAT IS DE MINIMUS LEADING TO CONFUSION AND LITIGATION ABOUT THE TERM ACTUALLY MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED AS DE MINIMUS A ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PUBLIC SUBSIDY TO A NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. NOT PROCESSING FACILITY PROJECTS THIS WAS ONLY ONE POINT 75% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. A PUBLIC SUBSIDY FOR PRIVATE PROJECT THAT IS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR 2% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST IS A NOTABLE TAXPAYER INVESTMENT AND IT IS REASONABLE TO REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGES. IF THE DEVELOPER WANTS A PUBLIC SUBSIDY OVER THAT AMOUNT. UNDER THIS BILL NO DEVELOPERS REQUIRED TO TAKE A PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SUBSIDY OVER THE DIMINISHMENT DE MINIMUS AMOUNT THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE. UP HOLDING A PREVAILING WAGE LAWS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ENSURE THAT CONTRACTORS ARE NOT AWARDED PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTS BY VIRTUE OF PAYING LOW WAGES AND UNDERCUTTING COMPETITORS. UP WITH DATA RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME JEREMY SMITH WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES. A SMALL THANK YOU THANK YOU -- MISTER KALRA FOR THAT EXCELLENT SUMMATION OF THE BILL JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL THE SPONSOR. OF THIS LEGISLATION. I'M NOT TOTALLY A FREEWARE WASN'T HERE THEN BUT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH LEGISLATIVE HISTORY IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE THE TERM TO MINIMIZE WAS PUT INTO THE LABOR CODE INTO THE PREVENT WAY JACKED IN THE EXCEPTIONS SECTION OF THE RULING WAGE. AND IT WASN'T A FINE BECAUSE NOBODY BACK AND THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO DEFINE IT THERE IS A LEGAL DEFINITION OF WORK THOUGH. IT IS QUOTE TRIFLING I OVERLOOK IT. pUNFORTUNATELY THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOT A DEFINITION AND THE PREVAILING WAGE ACT FOR THIS TERM HAS LED TO AS OPEN A LOOPHOLE -- THAT HAS BEEN EXPLOITED UNFORTUNATELY -- BY. OF FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DEVELOPERS -- MISTER KALRA GIVE A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE -- OF D. I. R. DETERMINATION -- OF A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC MONEY THAT WENT TO A PROJECT THAT DID NOT THEN TRIGGERED THE BRICK BRICK PREVAILING WAGE -- THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANOTHER ONE IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT WAS OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THERE'S A REAL ISSUE HERE -- WE NEED A DEFINITION -- FOR THIS TERM -- WAGES MEANT -- TO IT IS TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT GO TO A PROJECT AND WE BELIEVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS SHOULD GO TO PAYING NOT ONLY THE PREVAILING WAGE. BUT IT'S REALLY A LIVING WAGE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW -- WAGES BENEFITS THAT ARE IN LINE WITH THE MIDDLE CLASS LIVELIHOOD. AND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS DESERVE THAT AND TAXPAYERS DESERVE TO KNOW THEIR TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING TO PAY CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. A REAL LIVING WAGE OF FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. A GOOD AFTERNOON MIKE MONNA GOING TO BE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS A CALIFORNIA STATE I TRADES COUNCIL. MR SIX COUNTS OF SHEET METAL WORKERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL UNION ELEVATOR CONSTRUCTORS -- THIS BILL HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HAVE A GOOD RESOLUTION ALL. WHICH DUGGAR CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HEY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS SILVIO FOR ARI -- HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION JUST TO MAKE SURE WE SEPARATED WHERE THE RESIDENTIAL HOME BUILDERS SO WHEN YOU GUYS A REFERENCE SEEN. NOT MANUFACTURING PLANTS AND HOSPITALS LIKE IN THE FACT SHEET THAT'S NOT US WHERE THE RESIDENTIAL HOME BUILDERS -- AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE HERE -- IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL TODAY. TO BE CLEAR WE ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE 2% THRESHOLD THAT IS IN THE BILL. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE TWO HUNDRED SAN TRIGGER WILL MAKE A NUMBER OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO TRY TO PUSH PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVES -- MAKE THAT VERY VERY DIFFICULT -- A COUPLE EXAMPLES AND WANT TO PUT OUT THERE FOR YOU GUYS FIRST AGAIN AS NEW RESIDENTIAL BUILDERS. NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION IN A NUMBER OF AVENUES IS LOOKING TO PUSH THE ENVELOPES ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY WATER CONSERVATION. RENEWABLE GENERATION BATTERY STORAGE AND GET THOSE TECHNOLOGIES INTO THE MARKET PLACE -- TO INCORPORATE THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THEY HAVE TO BE COST EFFECTIVE MANY OF THOSE TECHNOLOGIES AT THIS POINT TIME ARE NOT. SO THE VERY OFTEN COME WITH A REBATE AND INCENTIVE SOMETHING THAT BRINGS THAT TECHNOLOGY TO A LEVEL THAT IT CAN BE INCORPORATED AS A STANDARD FEATURE ACROSS THE ENTIRE PROJECT -- IF THIS TOTAL SOME OF THOSE REBATES OR INCENTIVES. TRIGGER THE PREVAILING WAGE WILL INSTANTLY ALL THE SAID THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS NOW PREVAILING WAGE AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT COST THAT FAR EXCEED. THE SOME OF THOSE INCENTIVES AND REBATES SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WILL JUST FOR GO INSTALLING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES AND NOT GET THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS INTO THE MARKET PLACE. SECOND -- MORE AND MORE BUILDERS ARE BEING LOOKED TO TO HELP TRY TO AS PART OF A CURRENT -- DEVELOPMENT PROJECT GET RICHARD DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THIS IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE AS THE STATE IS LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOOKS TO GET PROJECTS GOING IN URBAN CORES CITY CENTERS. SO YOU'LL HAVE A PROJECT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL APPROACH YOU AND SAY HEY. WE HAVE AN ANTICIPATION THAT THESE FUTURE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO TAKE PLACE WE WOULD LIKE YOU AS PART OF THIS PROJECT TO GET INFRASTRUCTURE WATER SEWER. UTILITIES STREET LIGHTS CURB GUTTER AND SIDEWALK WE WOULD LIKE THAT STUFF TO BE OVERSIZED TOO SO WE CAN APPROPRIATELY HANDLE THOSE FUTURE PROJECTS. AND WE WILL SAY OKAY WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP YOU WITH THAT AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE THE DEVELOPER THE BUILDER FOR THE PORTION OF THE PROJECT THAT IS TO THE BENEFIT OF TOSE FUTURE PROJECTS SO IT'S NOT TO THE BENEFIT. OF THE FIRST IN PROJECT -- DOING THAT HAS HUGE BENEFITS FOR EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY SO -- YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT GETTING -- ALL THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH TEARING UP STREETS AND SIDEWALKS AND NOISE AND TRAFFIC GETTING ALL THAT STUFF DONE FIRST RELIEVES IT FOR THOSE FUTURE PROJECTS SO WHETHER IT'S THE HOMEOWNERS LIVING IN THE AREA -- BUSINESSES THAT HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THEIR STREETS AND SIDEWALKS BEING TORN UP WE CAN GET THOSE THINGS ACCOMPLISHED FIRST -- AND EARLY IN THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT. SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT -- HERE OPPOSING ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE BILL WE BELIEVE THAT THE 2% -- IN OUR VIEW HAS BEEN WELL INTO DISCUSSED IN THE IT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT EVEN OVER TIME IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS. THAT CONSTRUCTION COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE AND I THINK WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE OF THAT. SO EVEN WITH THAT WE EXPECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARISE IN THE FUTURE AND SO WE STRUGGLE WITH THE THOUGHT OF HAVING A HARD AND FAST NUMBER IN STATUTE IN PLACE AND IT NOT BE A PERCENTAGE OF OF CONSTRUCTION SO. FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL. OPPOSITION. AT THE TIME MISTER DICKEY. YES -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE FOR THE AUTHOR IS THAT -- WOULD -- WOULD HE BE OPEN -- TO JUST STICKING WITH THE 2% AND AND MAYBE NOT A NOT NOT PUT A FIXED NUMBER -- NOT PUT A FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT ON THE BILL. BECAUSE THINGS DO CHANGE AND WITHIN -- FOUR THAT THAT TWO EIGHTY THOUSAND ALL SEEM AWFULLY LOW. WELL UP THANKS FOR THE QUESTION THE SEVERITY OF THE THE PROBLEM AS EXEMPLIFIED BY WHAT BUT ONE OF THE EXAMPLES IS THE THE PROCESSING FACILITY I HAD THAT -- COST NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SINCE THE SUBSIDY WAS ONE POINT SIX MILLION IT ONLY AMOUNTED TO ONE POINT 75%. AND SO I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE PERCENTAGES THAT. YOU'LL PROJECTS OF THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT IS NOT NESTLE ACCOUNTED FOR AND THE REALITY IS THAT I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT IF THERE'S AT ANY AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SUBSIDY. THAT IS OF A SIGNIFICANT VALUE AND I I BELIEVE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER MONEY -- A PUBLIC SUBSIDY AND SO I'M I'M GOING TO STICK TO THAT I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS -- GOING FORWARD THOUGH -- BUT BUT I I DO BELIEVE THAT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE BILL IT IS NOT JUST A PERCENTAGE BUT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT AND I THINK THAT I BELIEVE TUNERS ANY BY THOUSANDS OF PARAMOUNT. TO BE A FOUNDATIONAL AMOUNT IN TERMS OF WHAT PUT THE PUBLIC SHOULD EXPECT IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY -- IN KIND OF A WAIT. IF IF THAT IS THE CASE WITH AND AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT RIGHT NOW BUT WOULD YOU BE OPEN -- TO PUTTING IN SOME SORT OF LAW THAT WILL ALLOW THAT THAT FIX DOLLAR TO RISE WITH INFLATION EVERY YEAR. I'M OPEN. TO ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE I'M I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO LISTEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU KNOW OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE CHERRY MY CLOSE. THANK YOU UP IN AN ODD TO SAY THAT A LOOK YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AT THE CITY LEVELS TO TRY TO INCENTIVIZE -- NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHAT HAVE YOU AND AND AND INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IF INCENTIVIZING NEW TECHNOLOGIES INTO NEW POP UP INTO NEW PROJECT CHOIRS PAYMENT ALL AGES THAT WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER WAY. TO INCENTIVIZE HE'S PROJECTS AND NOT ON THE BACKS THE WORKERS AND SO -- I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION -- AND REALLY OF US -- WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IF I TWENTY ENJOYS AN AYE RECOMMENDATION WITH A DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA. I'VE KALRA HI FLORA CARILLO HI CARILLO I DEEP HI. I HI THANK YOU ALYSSA. THANK YOU. NOW YOU HAVE A BE. THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR THE HEY. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A THIRTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND SALAS SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB THIRTY FIVE TODAY AND I DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE A MAN'S. I A HOME AND A LOT AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE JOINED BY A COLLEAGUES AS SOME MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA DOES PUT. A WORKPLACE SAFETY -- MY HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN A PRIORITY OF HERS FOR I EVEN BEFORE I ARRIVED HERE IN THIS BUILDING SO I'M GRATEFUL TO BE PARTNERING WITH ON THIS -- AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD IMPROVE HOW PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE MADE AWARE OF AND HANDLE CASES OF LEAD POISONING AMONG WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WOULD HELP PREVENT REPEATED OR PROLONGED INCIDENTS OF THAT PLACING A WORKPLACES. LED POSING CAN CAUSE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE COGNITIVE DIFFICULTIES RESULT IN MISCARRIAGES A PRIMER PREMATURE BIRTHS. IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND ALSO BECAUSE THE REVERSIBLE DAMAGE TO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND KIDNEYS. AS WE ALL KNOW LED CAN HAVE PROFOUND AND PERMANENT ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN BOTH CHILDREN LEAD POISONING CAN BE FATAL. WHILE THERE IS NO SAFE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL THE CDC SAYS THAT -- THAT LEVELS OF TWENTY FIVE MICROGRAMS CHRIS SAFETY SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR ALL BUSINESSES IN THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES CAL OSHA TO LOOK INTO WORK SITES THAT WORKERS WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. THIS IS A MODEST COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO HELP ENSURE THAT PROPER NOTIFICATIONS OF FOLLOW UP BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND CAL OSHA ARE MADE IN ORDER PROTECT PRESERVE PRESENT AND FUTURE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES -- AND AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WOULD BE A WILL BE TURNING IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE IN SOME REGARDS YET WAS ALSO GONNA -- SHARE A STORY THAT WE SHARED LAST YEAR ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT DOING ENOUGH IS A STATE. THANK YOU I'M A CO AUTHOR TO THIS IMPORTANT BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE TWENTY YEARS AGO EXCEPT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHIPPED ON A REALLY LONG TIME AGO AND AS WE STARTED DOING THE WORK AND WE WERE CARRYING ABOUT CONSTITUENTS ARE SAFE WE SAY. SOUTH THE QUESTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND DID WE DID WE PROTECT THEM -- AND SO I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT I WANT TO THANK. MISTER KALRA FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS BUT I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO READ A LETTER FROM A FORMER EXCITE WORKER. AND I'LL LEAVE MY AYE TESTIMONY AT THAT. OUR NAMES ARE LESHAN AN ELVEN RICHARDSON WE WANT TO THANK MISTER KALRA FOR INTRODUCING AB. TWENTY NINE SIXTY THREE WE KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW IMPORTANT IS LEGISLATION IS TO PROTECT FUTURE AND CURRENT WORKERS FROM LEAD POISONING HURTING THEIR LIVES. ALVIN STARTED WORKING AT THE RENDON PLANTS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. AFTER A FEW YEARS WORKING IN THIS MULTI ROOM ALVIN STARTED EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS WE NOW KNOW RELATED TO LEAD. EARLY ON IT WAS SMALL THINGS. PROBLEMS WITHOUT. LATER THE ISSUE GOT MORE SERIOUS ALVIN SPEECH BECAME SLURRED. THERE WAS THIS LOAN IS ABOUT HIM HE SEEMED TRAINED AND SLUGGISH. YOU MAY ASK WHY WOULD ANYONE STATE A JOB LIKE THAT. THE TRUTH IS I ALVIN SIMPLY NEEDED A PAYCHECK IN MAYBE A TRUSTED TOO MUCH WE WERE FREQUENTLY LET TESTED. WHEN MY NUMBERS GOT TOO HIGH I WOULD BE SENT HOME OR PUT ON WHAT WAS CALLED LIKE DUTY? THAT WAS MOSTLY OUTSIDE PAINTED WORK. WHEN THE LEVELS CAME DOWN A LIST BACK THIS MULTI ROOM IT WENT ON LIKE THIS UNTIL I FINALLY LEFT THE COMPANY IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN THE SYMPTOMS GOT TOO BAD? WE BETTER REASON INVESTIGATIVE STORY AND IT WAS VERY HURTFUL TO LEARN THAT CAL OSHA EXCUSE TO HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD THAT ALVIN ANOTHER EX HAD WORKERS ARE CONSTANTLY EXPOSED. TO SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THEIR DISPOSABLE THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICA OR CALIFORNIA IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND FOR MAKING CALIFORNIA A BETTER PLACE. TO OTHER FAMILIES DON'T HAVE TO ENDURE THE PAIN WE HAVE SINCERELY ALVIN ELLIS ON RICHARDSON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS A MEMBER WE HAVE BILL ALL YOU THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. I THANK YOU OF THIS THIS IS A REPEAT OF THE BILL -- WHITES NEEDED IS BECAUSE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. AND THAT'S CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS RARELY REFERRED THEM TO CAL OSHA. THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE CALLOUSLY TO FIND ANYONE OR SITE THEM IT JUST GET SOME TO GO AND INVESTIGATE THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING. WAS VETOED LAST YEAR FOR TWO REASONS BOTH OF WHICH WERE ERRONEOUS ONENESS IT CITED THE PENDING REGULATIONS BY CAL OSHA. AND THAT WAS INDEED THE SUBJECT OF A BILL HEARD A FEW MINUTES AGO AB FOR FIFTY SEVEN BY MISTER QUIRK. THAT IS ABOUT LEAD LEVELS IN THE AIR DOES NOTHING TO DO WITH BLOOD LEVELS AS NOTHING DO REFERRALS SEPARATE BILLS SEPARATE ISSUES SO IMPROPER REASON FREDO THERE AND THE OTHER IT'S SAD. THIS BILL WOULD HURT CD PH IS TRADITION OF WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH EMPLOYERS WHAT TURNS OUT THEY SAY THEY DO BUT THEY JUST DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE. THIS QUE THIS BILL ROSE OUT OF A LOCAL CASE A GUN RANGER IN CITY SACRAMENTO A FRIEND IS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER DID. AND FOUND OUT THAT WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEAD POISON THERE. THE CAL -- CD PH HAD WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE EMPLOYER THE CITY SACRAMENTO FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR AND MEANWHILE PEOPLE GETTING LEAD POISON WE CAN GIVE YOU DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BUSINESSES THAT STILL HAPPENING TODAY. WHERE THEY'RE STILL GETTING SPIKED LED POISONINGS AND CAL CD PH SITS ON THOSE AND SAYS WERE WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH THE EMPLOYER THIS BILL DOES SAYS TURN OVER TO CAL OSHA IF THEY'RE REALLY HIGH BLOOD LEVELS? THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THAT IF THIS BILL WAS IN PLACE WE MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED AN EXCITED BUT THERE'S ANOTHER LARGE BATTER RECYCLER IN -- LA NOW QUIT MEXICO WHICH HAS DOZENS OF LEAD POISONED WORKERS WE ALSO SHOOTING RANGES PAINT PAINTING COMPANY SAM BLASTING THEY'RE WORKING WITH LEAD THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE BILL. AND CV PH WE HOPE WIL SAY WE'RE OKAY WITH IT THIS YEAR IT'S SIMPLE FOR THEM TO TURN THESE NUMBERS THESE HUMAN FIGURES OVER TO CAL OSHA FOR ACTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I'M IN LIGHT OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED JUST A MOMENT AGO AS NOTED UNDER EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY SEVEN THERE IS A ONGOING RULE MAKING PROCESS THAT WE THINK% THIS. THIS GETS IN THE WAY OF TWO I'M REALLY REFERENCE BACK TO THE GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO MESSAGE OF A BETWEEN NINE SIXTY THREE LAST YEAR. INSIDE THE SAME CONCERNS AND IF I COULD BRIEFLY I'M I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE POINTS MADE -- IN SUPPORT ABOUT -- THE PRIOR BILL FORTY SEVEN THAT WE JUST HEARD IS IS IN CORRECTED. I MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD BUT I BELIEVE THE COMMENT WAS THAT THAT APPLY TO USE ONE TOPIC WHICH WAS JUST THE AIR -- HAVING SPOKEN TO THE AUTHOR ON FORTY SEVEN I BELIEVE THE INTENT IS TO AMEND THAT TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE TOPICS THE NEW REGULATIONS WILL COVER. SO I BELIEVE THAT ACTUALLY ITIS BROADER THAN -- THEN WHAT WAS STATED HEARING WILL ADDRESS MORE ISSUES -- TRYING TO OURS AND I HOPE I DID MISUNDERSTAND A COMMON BUT TURNING TO OUR TO SPECIFIC CONCERNS. FIRST -- IN HOW THIS WILL CREATE A CONTRADICTORY RELATION TO THE PRESENT STANDARDS -- THE PRESENT STANDARDS IN AGAIN THEY MAY CHANGE BUT THE CONCERN WILL STILL APPLY -- THE PRESENT STANDARDS UNDER OSHO REQUIRE -- BLOOD TESTING AND I'LL I'LL TRY TO BE CLEAR AT THIS A BLOOD TESTING -- CAN BE ENDED IF IT IS FOR TWO TESTS IN A ROW WORKERS BLOOD LEVELS BELOW THIRTY MICROGRAMS. I'M HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TESTING DPH BEING REQUIRED TO FORWARD TO OSHA AND SHOULD CONSIDER A SERIOUS VIOLATION. AT A LEVEL OF TWENTY FIVE I BELIEVE THE MOMENTS WERE -- TWENTY TWENTY MICROGRAMS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPELLING OSHA TO DO AN URGENT INVESTIGATION AT A LEVEL BELOW WHAT IS PRESENTLY EVEN -- THE LEVEL THAT THE EMPLOYER MUST KEEP TESTING. SO AND NOT TO GET INTO THE MERITS OF THOSE BUT JUST TO SHOW THAT THAT IS A CONTRADICTORY STANDARD THE BUSINESS WE HAVE TO LOOK TO WHEN. TESTING IS NOT AN ONGOING REQUIRED AT THIS LEVEL BUT OSHA'S INVESTIGATION MUST HAPPEN URGENTLY. I'M AND THAT CONTRADICTORY POSSIBILITY MIGHT EXIST GOING FORWARD AND FUTURE REGULATIONS AS WELL AGAIN THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN FINALIZED BUT THAT IS OUR CONCERN THAT THIS WILL PUT CONTRADICTORY REQUIREMENTS IN FRONT OF EMPLOYERS -- SECOND I BELIEVE THE PRESENT TENSE OF OF THE BILL DOES NOT LEAVE SPACE -- FOR DPH TO DETERMINE THAT THE LEVEL OF LEAD WHICH IS AN ISSUE -- IS BECAUSE FROM THE WORKPLACE -- WE MENTION THIS BRIEFLY PREVIOUSLY BUT AGAIN. IS IT THE NATURE OF LEAD PAINT IN CALIFORNIA HOMES IS SOMETHING THIS COMMITTEE IS IS WELL AWARE OF AND RIGHTLY CONCERNED WITH. AND COMPELLING OSHA TO INVESTIGATE COMPELLING IN PLAYERS TO WORK WITH THAT BUT WHEN THE SOURCE OF THE LEAD MAY NOT EVEN BE THE WORKPLACE IS A CONCERN FOR US IN TERMS OF BIRD -- SO. EARLY MAKE SURE OF YEAH FOR THAT REASON -- WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HEARING NONE ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MISS GONZALEZ. I'M. WHAT IS AN OKAY LEVEL OF LETTING YOUR BLOOD? NO NO LEVEL IS OKAY ACTUALLY LET ME BE CLEAR IT ALL MAKES YOU SICK AND IF YOU'RE A MINOR AND IT'S IT'S ALSO IMPRESS YOUR COGNITIVE ABILITIES -- BUT THE A CH PD IS LOOKING AT TWENTY MICROGRAMS WHICH IS IN LINE WITH WHAT THIS BILL HOUSE. OKAY SO PERHAPS THE OSHA STANDARD -- FOR RETESTING OR CONTINUE TESTING -- NEED IS OUTDATED WE NEED TO REDUCE THAT AS WELL MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE BILLS AND AND OF THE SUMMER GONZALEZ THE CLEARLY THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. ONE WHICH REDUCES IT WOULD TWENTY FIVE MILLIGRAMS TWENTY MILLIGRAMS IS PER DISCUSSIONS WITH CAL OSHA AND THERE'S ANOTHER AMENDMENT WHICH HAS PEREMPTORY LAYOUT LANGUAGE SHOULD CAL OSHA ADOPT STRICTER RAGS IN THE FUTURE WE DON'T HAVE COME BACK ANOTHER BILL. THEY SAY IT'S FIFTEEN THEN THIS WILL MOVE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF CALLOW SHOW SO THIS IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO NOT JUST GET IT RIGHT TODAY. BUT MAKE SURE THAT AND THE GOING INTO THE FUTURE THAT CAL OSHA IS THE ONE THAT'S MAKING THE DETERMINATION SPACE ON THE SCIENCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE. MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD ADD WITH CHILDREN INFANTS PREGNANT WOMEN REALLY LOW LEVELS ARE PERMANENTLY HARMFUL THEY LOWER I. Q. AS YOU KNOW YOU DID IT THE BILL ON TESTING SCHOOLS. WITH ADULTS OR THE CHANCE TO IMPROVE AND THEY THEY OFTEN REMOVE THE WORKER FROM THE SOURCE WHICH IS ALMOST ALWAYS. THE WITH OF SOURCE A PLACE TO WORK NOT THE HOME BUT SOMETIMES IT IS THE HOME AND THEY CAN IMPROVE IF THEY GET BACK UP AGAIN THEY'RE TAKEN OUT OF THE WORKPLACE. BUT THAT'S WHAT CALLUSES GOOD I'VE READ THE PROPOSED RAGS THE SUBJECT MISTER COURSE BILL THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE STRONG BUT AGAIN IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN AB. NINE THIRTY FIVE PURSES FOR FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A QUESTION THAT I AS CLOSE TO AN ANSWER TO BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT WHEN I THINK THE CHAMBER -- FOR BRINGING OUT THE DEFICIENCY IN THE CALLUSES STANDARD AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE SUPPORTIVE WHEN THEY'RE LINED. UP. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD OBVIOUSLY AS WE CONTINUE -- THE VERY VITAL TASK OF IDENTIFYING WHEN PEOPLE DO HAVE LEAD IN THEIR BLOOD I MEAN FROM A COMMUNITY WHERE IT COULD BE FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES THAT COULD BE FROM MARKET COULD BE FROM. HOME IT COULD BE FROM A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT THAT THE THE WHATEVER IT COMES FROM -- REMEDIATING NOT STOPPING IS A HUGE THING SO THANK YOU THIS IMPORTANT BILL -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE MISTER CHAIR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU. OF A INTO JUSTIN'S BUT TO ADD ON TO THE FINAL POINT HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS REALLY THE REFERRAL WHICH IS CRITICAL REFERRAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO CAL OSHA DOESN'T COMPEL A PARTICULAR RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT CAL OSHA DO THEIR JOB AND THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB. THEY CAN'T DO THEIR JOB IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION THING THAT INFORMATION TO THEM IN A TIMELY FASHION. LET THEM. DO THEIR INVESTIGATION AND IF IT'S NOT DUE TO THE WORKPLACE WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IS DUE TO THIS TO THE WORKPLACE I THINK IT EVEN BENEFITS EMPLOYERS AND SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WHEN THE PROBLEM BECOMES MUCH MORE WORSE A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO MITIGATE. AS WITH THAT I RESPECT THE ASPIRIN ABOVE. THANK YOU AND JUST TO BE CLEAR MISTER CHAIR YOU ARE TAKING YOUR OWN COMMITTEES. I YES I AM TAKING MY OWN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- AND AND I I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY JOINT AUTHORS AMBER GARCIA -- FOR JOINING ME IN THIS EFFORT THANK YOU PHIL ENJOYS AYE RECOMMENDATION TO DO PATH MEANT THAT TO APPROPRIATIONS BENEFACTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
