ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIVIGNO RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND HAPPY PURIM EVERYONE I KNOW THAT WASN'T A HOLIDAY THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING SOMEONE TO WISH EVERYONE- I THINK- THE CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS HELP MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE HAMANN TASCHEN SIGN EVERYONE'S DESK. AND AND IT'S INTERESTING I'M THE BILL I'M TALKING ABOUT HAS TO DO WITH THE HAMANN TASCHEN IS NAMED AFTER IT WAS A VERY BAD MAN WHO. YEAH YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BOO HIM WHEN HIS NAME IS MENTIONED DURING THE POOR ON THE HOLIDAY. EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU SEE HIM IN AND- SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT FLASHING CURSOR ATION WHICH WOULD NEVER BE APPLIED TO A VERY BAD PERSON I CAME IN- AB SEVENTEEN FOR THANK YOU I HEARD THAT BACK THERE. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR WOULD EXTEND THE SUNSET ON THE AUTHORITY TO USE FLASH INCARCERATION UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. SLASH INCARCERATION IS A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS VIOLATIONS OF AN OFFENDER AS CONDITIONS OF PROBATION OR MANDATORY SUPERVISION BY IMPOSING A SHORT DETENTION. OF UP TO TEN DAYS BUT NOT NECESSARILY THAT MANY DAYS AND CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN THE DITCH IN DETERRING. FUTURE VIOLATIONS. INTERMEDIATE SANCTIONS LIKE FLASHING CAR SERRATION BALANCE THE NEED TO HOLD OFFENDERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR VIOLATIONS OF THEIR SUPERVISION WHILE FOCUSING ON SHORTER DISRUPTIONS FROM WORK HOME OR PROGRAMMING. SO WITHOUT FLASHING PERSPIRATION NORMAL REVOCATION HEARINGS WOULD TAKE PLACE RESULTING IN LONG COURT PROCEEDINGS OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IN CUSTODY FLASHING CAR STREET AND STOPS THAT FROM OCCURRING. MAKES IT VERY SHORT IN DURATION POSSIBLY SAVING SOMEONE'S JOB OR HOME ACCESS TO THEIR CHILDREN WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING THIS BILL PASSED OUT OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WITH STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

PROCLAIMING MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. DURING THIS MONTH WE PAY TRIBUTE TO THE AMAZING WOMEN THAT HAVE COME BEFORE US AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. AND EVEN HERE IN OUR STATE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE WE HAVE PARITY IN ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY. TODAY WE CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT TO A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WOMEN FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND OUR RIGHT TO SERVE IN OFFICE BUT TODAY WE MUST ALSO DOUBLE DOWN ON OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE OUR STATE LEGISLATURE LOOKS MORE LIKE THE GREAT STATE. WE COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT. A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE FIRST FOR WOMEN ELIZABETH HUGHES. ANNA SAILOR. ESTO BROTEN AND GRACE STORES WERE ELECTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. SINCE EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE THERE HAVE BEEN. THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MEMBERS ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. AND OF THOSE ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE. ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE HAVE BEEN WOMEN. THE TOTAL NUMBER FOR THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING THE SENATE IS FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN ELECTED SINCE EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE HAVE BEEN WOMEN. ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE FIRST WOMEN WERE ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE OUR CURRENT WOMEN'S CAUCUS MEMBERS CONTINUE TO MAKE HISTORY AND BREAK GLASS CEILINGS. HERE IN OUR HOUSE WE HAVE THE FIRST BLACK LATINO TO PRESIDE OVER AN ASSEMBLY FLOOR SESSION. THE FIRST AND ONLY LET THE END OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE FROM ORANGE COUNTY. THE FIRST REPUBLICAN LATINO IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND THESE ARE CHRISTINA'S NOTES IN THE FIRST LATINO MAJORITY LEADER EVER. OUR WOMEN'S CAUCUS MEMBERS HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN BREAKING GLASS CEILINGS BUT ARE UNITED IN OUR FIGHT TO ENSURE ALL WOMEN ARE TREATED RESPECTED AND PAID AS WE RIGHTFULLY DESERVE. THE PANDEMIC IS ONLY EXACERBATED AND HIGHLIGHTED THE WORK WE NEED TO DO TO LIFT UP ALL WOMEN AND GIVEN US. AND TO GIVE US A GREATER SENSE AND THIS IS GIVING US A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY. WE CELEBRATE WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH EVERY YEAR TO RECOGNIZE THE HISTORICAL ROLES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE TRAILBLAZING WOMEN THAT CAME BEFORE US. TODAY WE CELEBRATE AMAZING WOMEN FROM EACH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WERE WORKING DAY IN AND DAY OUT TO MAKE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND OUR GOLDEN STATE BETTER. IN WAYS BIG AND SMALL NOTICED AND UNNOTICED LEADERS LIKE OUR HONOREES HAVE INSPIRED AND CHANGED OUR COMMUNITIES FOR THE BETTER. AND KEPT US GOING DURING AN EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING TIME. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT WE DECIDED WE MUST CONTINUE THIS RECOGNITION THIS YEAR. YOU ALL HAVE RECEIVED A WOMAN OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO BOOK. IT WAS DELIVERED TO YOUR OFFICES AND THERE'S ALSO ONE FOR EACH OF YOUR- HONOREES ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. THE CERTIFICATE OUR HONOREES WILL RECEIVE DEPICTS THE ARTWORK OF A BOOK BY SOLENO SOLOMON'S CALLED HOW WE WON THE VOTE IN NINETEEN ELEVEN. THE IMAGE PORTRAYS A WOMAN PRESENTED PRESENTING THE SIX STAR TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS CALIFORNIA WAS A SIX STATE TO GIVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. LET US COME TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE ALL OF OUR HONOREES THE TRAILBLAZING WOMEN OF THE PAST. AND THE HISTORY MAKING WOMEN OF TODAY AND BEYOND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE OUR STATE FORWARD. THANK YOU REGARDING LEADER REYES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER CAN YOU RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I'M HONORED TO RISE ON BEHALF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF HR EIGHTY NINE I WANT TO FIRST THANK THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HONORING RUTH BETTER GINSBURG TODAY SHE AS WE ALL KNOW IS CREDITED AND WELL DESERVING OF OUR CREDIT FOR GIVING US WOMEN MANY. OF THE RIGHTS WE ENJOY TODAY THAT HAVE ALLOWED US TO GET TO THIS ASSEMBLY FLOOR TO REPRESENT OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IS INCREDIBLY PROUD OF WHO CARRIED OUR VALUES OF TWO COULD ALLOW HIM TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND AND DID INCREDIBLE WORK DURING HER LIFETIME. BUT I WANT TO TOUCH ON. AT THE HOLIDAY THAT WE AS JEWS CELEBRATE TODAY. TODAY IS POOR- THE DOWN WHICH WE'RE ALSO CELEBRATING THIS RESOLUTION FOR WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. JEWS IN HIS LAND WITHOUT REALIZING THAT HIS OWN WIFE ESTHER WAS JEWISH. IN HER SAFETY BEHIND THE CASTLE WALLS. ESTHER FIRST FALTERED IN SPEAKING OUT. UNTIL SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM HER FAMILY I. DO NOT THINK THAT YOU WILL ESCAPE THE FATE OF ALL THE JEWS BY BEING IN THE KING'S PALACE IT SAID. THIS MOMENT IS WHY YOU WERE CHOSEN FOR THE ROLE. IN THE STORY OF POOR M. ASTER IS. THE HERO. SHE IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAVES THE JEWISH PEOPLE. AND I THINK IT'S APT TODAY THAT WE REMEMBER THAT THAT THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY WHETHER CREDIT OR NOT WOMEN WHO'VE BEEN. THE HEROES OF MANY OF OUR STORIES AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ON DAYS LIKE TODAY BUT ALSO. EVERY DAY WE GIVE CREDIT TO THE WOMEN WHO WORK SO HARD TO REPRESENT. THOSE WHO NEED THEIR VOICES AND FIGHT FOR RIGHTS FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL TO REMEMBER. THAT IN THIS TIME OF ANY QUALITY OF ESCALATING GLOBAL GLOBAL CRISIS. IT'S EASY FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT AFFECTED TO SHOT THE CASTLE DOORS ANDIGNORE THE UFFERING OF THE WORLD'S. IF YOU ARE A MAN. WHO ISN'T AFFECTED BY GENDER INEQUITIES. OR IF YOU HOLD POWER. IT IS OUR JOB TO USE THAT PRIVILEGE FOR OTHERS. BECAUSE AS LONG AS OPPRESSION STANDS DO NOT THINK HE WILL. ESCAPE THE FATE OF THE OPPRESSED. SO FROM THE PANDEMIC TO THE VIOLENT CONFLICT WE KNOW WOMEN DISPROPORTIONATELY SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF MANY OF THESE DISASTERS. SO AS WE CELEBRATE WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH WE WHO STAND IN THIS IMPORTANT BUILDING. MUST REMEMBER AND STAND UP FOR THE WOMEN. WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CAREERS IN THE PANDEMIC. THE SINGLE MOTHERS WHO FACE FINANCIAL DEVASTATION. WE SHOULD STAND FOR THE WOMEN OF UKRAINE THE WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD WHO NEED OUR VOICES. THE HISTORY OF WOMEN. IS A HISTORY OF STRUGGLE OF SOLIDARITY BUT ALSO A TRIUMPH AND TODAY IT IS OUR JOB TO CARRY THAT FORWARD. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND H. R. EIGHTY NINE.

SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OUR LATINO CAUCUS I WANT TO SAY WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF LATINOS THE WORD FIERCE PASSIONATE. AND STRONG OFTEN COME TO MIND ALL MET SOMETIMES WE CAN BE EVEN A LITTLE SCARY. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE WILLING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT. FROM ASTRONAUTS TO ARTISTS LATINA TRAILBLAZERS PAST AND PRESENT HAVE HELPED SHAPE THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR NATION AND OUR STATE. SOME OF THESE EXAMPLES INCLUDE A MARIE THEODORE AND HER DAUGHTER VANESSA GILLIAN FROM MY DISTRICT FULLERTON WHO OPENED UP ZOMBIE DONUTS WHICH HAS NOW RECEIVED NOT ONLY MANY AWARDS BUT PEOPLE LINE UP FOR THOSE INCREDIBLE DONUTS A MOM AND DAUGHTER BUSINESS IN FULLERTON. JUSTIN JUSTICE PARTRIDGE A GUERRERO WHO MADE HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA BY BECOMING THE FIRST LATINA TO BE NOMINATED TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT. PRISCILLA CORONADO WHO MADE HISTORY AS THE FIRST LATINO PRESIDENT OF HARVARD LAW REVIEW IMMIGRANT LATINA TO JOIN THE NASA ACADEMY AND BECOME FLIGHT DIRECTOR FOR THE HISTORIC MARS PERSEVERANCE ROVER. MARIA ELENA BUT BECAUSE THE A NOBLE PRIZE NOMINATED MICROBIOLOGISTS WHO CO INVENTED A CO VIDHAN NINETEEN VACCINE THAT'S JUST A FEW.

FOR CONCURRENCE AND SENATE AMENDMENTS THE CLERK WILL READ. SENATE BILL TWO FORTY FIVE BY SOONER GONZALEZ AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO FORTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR LENA GONZALEZ STATE LICENSED HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS ISSUED AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND TWO TWENTY TWO TO COVER ABORTION AND ABORTION RELATED SERVICES WITHOUT A COPAYMENT DEDUCTIBLE OR ANY TYPE OF COST SHARING. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A LEADER IN PROTECTING AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO ACCESS ABORTION AND WHILE THESE EFFORTS HAVE HELPED MAINTAIN THIS RIGHT FOR DECADES THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS REMAINING BARRIERS TO ACCESSING CARE INCLUDING AFFORDABILITY. HEALTH PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER ABORTION SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY CAN STILL CHARGE HIGH DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS THAT CAN RANGE FROM FORTY DOLLARS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. A RECENT FIVE YEAR STUDY CONDUCTED BY U. C. S. F. OF A THOUSAND WOMEN SEEKING ABORTION CARE AT THIRTY FACILITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FOUND THAT OVER HALF OF THE WOMEN HAD OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES OF MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME. THESE HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO CARE THAT CAN BE COST PROHIBITIVE TO WORKING FAMILIES. SB TWO FORTY FIVE WILL REMOVE THIS BARRIER AND ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS THEIR LEGAL RIGHT TO ABORTION. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS LIVED IN STATES LIKE LOUISIANA AND PRACTICE AS AN OBGYN IN TEXAS. I HAVE SEEN THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF PLACING BARRIERS TO ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. AND I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST THAT PROTECTING ACCESS TO ABORTION IS IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER. AS OUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE CARE IS UNDER ATTACK IN STATE HOUSES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE CHAMBERS OF OUR U. S. SUPREME COURT. CALIFORNIA MUST REMAIN A LEADER IN THIS FIGHT AND MUST CONTINUE TO DEFEND AND EXPAND ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB TWO FORTY FIVE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OUR CAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I WANT TO RISE AND THANK. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL AND BEING A CO AUTHOR AND AS WELL AS SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE WE TALK A LOT ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THEY'RE NEVER BE BARRIERS TO NEEDED MUCH NEEDED HEALTH CARE AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT ABORTION CARE IS HEALTH CARE AND THIS IS REMOVING A CRITICAL BARRIER WHEN YOU HEARD OUR COLLEAGUES SAY THAT A THIRD OF SOMEONE'S MONTHLY WAGES GO TO GETTING THIS HEALTHCARE. HERE'S A REAL AND MEANINGFUL AND THEY'RE STOPPING PEOPLE FROM GETTING ACCESS TO THIS HEALTHCARE. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER YOU MAY CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE ON SB TWO FORTY FIVE THANK YOU. THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. WHERE TO VOTE. ALL THOSE VOTE YOU DESIRE TO VOTE. THANK.
