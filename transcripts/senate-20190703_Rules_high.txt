WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASURE TO BE HERE I AM HONORED. TO BE ASKED TO SERVE ON CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION -- IT'S A PROPITIOUS MOMENT FOR EDUCATION IN THE STATE. MANY OF YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA WAS ONCE ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE EDUCATION SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY AND PERHAPS IN THE WORLD -- BUT WE HAD A STEADY DECLINE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- WHICH CAUSED ONE FILMMAKER TO CREATE A FILM CALLED FROM FIRST TO WORST TO CHARACTERIZE -- CALIFORNIA'S SLIDE -- BY TWO SUB THOUSAND SEVEN WE WERE IN THE BOTTOM FIVE STATES ON DOLLARS AND STAFFING AND ACHIEVEMENT. BUT WE'VE HAD A TURNAROUND IN RECENT YEARS AND A NEW FUNDING SYSTEM NEW ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS. INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORTS GAINS IN ACHIEVEMENT GAINS IN GRADUATION RATES AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO CONTINUE THIS PATH AND I'VE LOOKED AT A LOT OF STATES AND A LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT HAVE REALLY ACHIEVED ACADEMICALLY AND THEY HAVE. A FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEAR PERIOD OF BUILDING ON SUCCESS AND REFINING AND IMPROVING WHAT THEY'VE DONE. A AND I THINK THAT'S THE PATH WE'RE ON AT THE STATE BOARD SO I HOPE TO CONTRIBUTE. TO THAT PATH AND TO HELP US A MOVE FROM WORST TO FIRST. LET ME START WITH YOU SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE -- ACTUALLY A DOCTOR HAMON AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VERY DETAILED THE I THINK IT WAS YESTERDAY I'M LOSING TRACK OF TIME MAYBE WAS THE DAY BEFORE. ON OUR STATE -- CRITIC EDUCATION EFFORTS THE LC FF AN ALLE CAP PROCESS AMONG MANY OTHER ISSUES -- AM EXTRAORDINARILY PROUD THAT SHE IS CONTINUING TO SERVE US -- AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE BOARD OF LOOK FORWARD. TO MOVING HER CONFIRMATION -- AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME CONGRATULATIONS DR. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR POINT AND I'M LOOKING FOR TO VOTING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION -- WE TOO HAD A LOVELY CONVERSATION YESTERDAY WHICH I VERY MUCH APPRECIATED SOME THIS CALL THINGS I WANTED TO GET OUT THERE BECAUSE JUST SO YOU CAN ARTICULATED SO I'VE HAD A LOT OF CONSTITUENT LETTERS. ON THE RECENT AT HEALTH EDUCATION STANDARDS I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT IT IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE THE PROCESS AND IN THE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S IN THERE SO. THAT'S OUT IN THE PUBLIC AROUND MIGHT APPRECIATE OR YES I THINK IT WAS MY SECOND BOARD MEETING AT WHICH WE WERE -- PRESENTED WITH THE HEALTH EDUCATION FRAMEWORKS -- AND I THINK PROBABLY MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT PART OF THE FRAMEWORKS BUT 90% OF IT IS NUTRITION AND SAFETY AND WHERE YOUR BICYCLE HELMET AND SO ON BUT THERE'S ABOUT 10% WHICH IS ON SEX EDUCATION WHICH IS INTENDED TO HELP DISTRICTS. IMPLEMENT THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED SOME YEARS AGO REQUIRING SEX EDUCATION AT FIFTH GRADE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL -- THE GUIDANCE IN THE FRAMEWORK IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL IT IS COMPLETELY -- UP TO THE DISTRICTS -- WHAT THEY USE AND FOR PARENTS -- THEY GET A NOTICE A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THERE'S A SEX EDUCATION -- LESSON OR OR UNIT OF INSTRUCTION AND THEY CAN SEE ALL THE MATERIALS AND CAN OPT OUT -- IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO -- BUT THESE MATERIALS ARE MADE AVAILABLE AS OPTIONS -- FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MANDATE. THROUGH THE LAW. WE GOT A LOT OF PARA COMMENT ON THIS SET OF MATERIALS AND AND WAS VERY HELPFUL ACTUALLY TO MEMBERS OF THE BOARD -- THERE WERE SOME RESOURCES THAT WERE FLAG THAT WERE REALLY -- CHALLENGING -- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MANY PARENTS AND BOARD MEMBERS AGREED THAT SOME OF THOSE WERE NOT -- IDEAL FOR RECOMMENDING TO SCHOOL SO WE TOOK SOME OF THEM OUT AS WE PASSED THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK FORWARD WE NOW THINK IT'S A USEFUL TOOL BUT IT IS A COMPLETELY OPTIONAL TOOL. FOR DISTRICTS USE. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT -- WE JUST RECENTLY HAD THE TASK FORCE THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOL POLICY TASK FORCE RECENTLY CAME OUT THEIR REPORT. WARNING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS. WELL THE CHURCH SCHOOL TASK FORCE -- GAVE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS A NUMBER OF THEM WERE UNANIMOUS AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY HAD KIND OF EVERYONE AT THE TABLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HAVE A GOOD. STRONG HEALTHY CHARTER SECTOR THAT YOU KNOW ALSO AVOIDS CHALLENGES OR ABUSES OF ANY KIND SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS USEFUL THERE WERE. AGREEMENTS OF I DON'T KNOW IF I THERE WAS A LOT OF RECOGNITION WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT THERE WAS -- SOME AGREEMENT ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE CRITERIA AND CLARIFY THE CRITERIA FOR AUTHORIZATION. RE AUTHORIZATION WAYS THAT WE CAN CREATE A STRONGER PROCEDURE OF THROUGH THE PROCESSES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN HE STATE LEVEL. SOME AGREEMENTS THAT I ACTUALLY WAS UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT WHILE THE STATE CURRENTLY DOES ACTUALLY OPERATE A SET OF CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OVERSEAS US OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT THAT WAS PROBABLY NOT THE IDEAL ROLE FOR THE STATE ALTHOUGH THERE MIGHT BE. A STATE APPEAL OF SOME SORT -- ONE WE HAVE A SCHOOL APPROVED THEY SHOULD BE RUN BY. A COUNTY OR DISTRICT THAT HAS THE APPARATUS TO SUPPORT THEM WHILE. ALSO I THINK THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POSITIVE STEPS MADE I KNOW THERE'S MORE WORK GOING ON I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY. IN THE MIDDLE OF THINKING ABOUT THAT WORK AND WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU DECIDE. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ANSWERS AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON THE APPOINTMENT AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU WILL MY OUR COLLEAGUE I TO MY RIGHT. CERTAINLY COVERED THE ISSUES THAT WE COVER DIE IN OUR A FACE TO FACE -- DOCTOR HAMON AND CERTAINLY -- YOU ARE SO VERY QUALIFIED AND THINK I SHARE THAT WITH YOU. A BECAUSE OF THE HIGH THE INTENSE -- ISSUES GOING ON IN MY DISTRICT OVER THE HEALTHCARE AND THOSE HAVE NOT SUBSIDED ARE I WILL -- ABSTAINED TODAY AND I SHARE THAT WITH YOU I NEED TO GO OUT AND SHARE WITH THEM THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED ME WHAT IS CONFUSING IN MY DISTRICT THE TO DISTRICT. I IS THE OPT IN OPT OUT ISSUE AND THEY I DON'T THINK THEY'VE GOT IT RIGHT YEAH. SO BASED ON OUR CONVERSATION I'LL BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THAT AND IN INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IT GOES ON FOR YOU KNOW. EVERYDAY SO I WILL BE DOING THAT IN PER HOUSE SO WE GET TO THE FLOOR I I WILL BE IN A GOOD POSITION TO SUPPORT YOU THEN IT WILL. ONLY TIME WILL TELL IT BECAUSE WE HAVE A LITTLE TIME HERE. FOR A VACATION COMING OUT BUT IN ANY EVENT -- WE HAD A VERY VERY -- INFORMATIVE CONVERSATION ARE VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR RESUME AND ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE END DEDICATED SO MUCH OF YOUR LIFE TO THIS SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND HOPEFULLY ON I MANY BE ON YOUR TEAM WHEN WE GET BACK TOGETHER THANK YOU GOOD LUCK. IN YOUR EXPLANATION YES. BIG JOB AHEAD OF ME. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR SERVICE WE ALSO HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION SOMEONE ABBREVIATED BUT WE DID TALK SOME ABOUT. ENGLISH LEARNERS AND UNDER THE LC FFE. INCENTIVE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAYBE NOT TO MOVE STUDENTS FORWARD SINCE THEY GET A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE AS LONG AS THEY'RE AND ENGLISH LEARNER YOU SHARED SOME IDEAS WITH ME ON THAT THAT I THINK WOULD BE VALUABLE TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE HOW WE MIGHT. LOOK AT THAT IN THE FUTURE SURE OF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU REYES WAS -- WHETHER THEIR DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS APPLIED ACROSS DISTRICTS FOR RECLASSIFYING STUDENTS AND HOW COULD WE MAKE THOSE MORE CONSISTENT AND THEN HOW TO ME INCENTIVIZE -- RE CLASSIFICATION WHEN IT'S WARRANTED -- SO ON THE FIRST OF THOSE ISSUES WE HAVE JUST THE BOARD HAS JUST APPROVED A NEW ENGLISH LEARNER ASSESSMENT -- AND THAT WE THINK OF WILL -- CREATE A BETTER OF MORE CONSISTENT SORT OF EVIDENCE BASE ABOUT WHEN. A LEARNER'S ARE READY TO BE RECLASSIFIED -- AND THEN YOU TO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT WHEN YOU GET A MONEY FOR THE NUMBER OF ENGLISH LEARNERS YOU HAVE. WHEN THEY BECOME A CLASSIFIED AND ARE NO LNGER IN THAT CATEGORY YOU MIGHT HAVE AN INCENTIVE NOT? TO LOSE THAT MONEY AND WE KNOW THAT QUITE OFTEN EVEN AFTER STUDENTS REQUEST BY THEY DO NEED SOME ONGOING SUPPORT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SO IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR THERE TO BE A YEAR OR TWO OF ONGOING MODEST SUPPORT FOR THAT PROCESS -- SO THAT STUDENTS AREN'T DROPPED FROM ANY SERVICES OR SUPPORTS AND SO THAT THERE IS. AN INCENTIVE TO RECLASSIFY WHEN-IT'S TIME THANK YOU IN THIS I THINK YOU ALSO MENTIONED. THE ABILITY TO MAYBE. MAKE SURE THAT STUDENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN THE TRANSITION EXACTLY NOT JUST DROPPED OFF. IN THEN I ALSO ASKED IF OU HAD A MAGIC WAND WHAT WOULD YOU DO AND YOU SHARED SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT TEACHER TRAINING THAT I FOUND. I YEAH YEAH I I WAS HAPPY TO HAVE THAT MAGIC WAND I WOULD LIKE TO HOLD ON TO IT IF I COULD BUT I THINK IT VANISHES ONCE I LEAVE THIS HERE -- BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO BUILD NOW THAT WE'VE GOT A NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM STANDARDS CURRICULUM FRAMEWORKS AND SO ON A SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THAT IS A REALLY STRONG SYSTEM. OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING FOR TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS -- SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE. SERVICES FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS OR MATH INSTRUCTION THERE IS HIGH QUALITY READILY AVAILABLE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT -- THAT MEETS THE STANDARDS WE KNOW -- SUCCEEDS IN THAT REGARD SUSTAINED WORK WITH COACHING FOLLOW UP NOT ALL OF IT PROVIDED BY THE STATE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PROVIDERS OF SUCH SERVICES. BUT ORCHESTRATED IN A WAY THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT WE HAVE THAT WE CAN FILL THE GAPS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. EDUCATORS WHO WANT TO DO THEIR BEST WORK ARE NOT. LOOKING UNDER ROCKS FOR KNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW LIKE MAYBE I'LL FIND THE ANSWER HERE BUT REALLY BUILDING THAT SYSTEM SO THAT IT'S READILY AVAILABLE. AND WE CAN REALLY IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING. AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OFACCESS BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC ECONOMIC DIVERSITY AROUND THE STATE SOME TEACHERS MIGHT HAVE. MORE READY ACCESS TO THAT TYPE OF SUPPORT AND TRAINING THAN OTHERS THAT IS DEFINITELY A CASE. THAT WE DO HAVE A WORK GOING ON TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF COUNTIES TO MEET MANY OF THOSE NEEDS AND SO ON BUT THERE ARE HOLES IN THEIR GAPS IS A LITTLE SWISS CHEESY RIGHT NOW AND I THINK FOR ALL KIDS. TO GET THE BENEFIT OF GOOD TEACHING AND LEARNING WE WANTED TO BE. MORE LIKE CHEDDAR CHEESE OR SOMETHING HOLES. THANK YOU AND THEN FINALLY WE TALK SOME ABOUT THE DASHBOARD IN KIND OF A DIVERSITY RIGHT NOW ON WHAT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ONLINE. BETWEEN DISTRICTS BETWEEN SCHOOLS EVEN AND YOU SHARED SOME OF YOUR OBJECTIVES TO TRY TO YEAH WE IN MORE UNIFORMITY THERE WE'VE WE'VE JUST BEGUN A CONVERSATION. IN THE STATE BOARD STAFF AND THE CD STAFF ABOUT HOW TO BRING TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE THE VARIOUS KINDS OF DATA THAT ARE IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE SOMETIMES. TO EVEN DRAW DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY'RE FROM DIFFERENT YEARS AND DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES AND SO ON AND RATIONALIZE THAT MAKE IT. A PERHAPS THE SYSTEM WHEN YOU GO INTO THE DASHBOARD THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE. ABOUT THE TRENDS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS ACHIEVEMENT OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU CAN SEE THE TRENDS EASILY AND READILY YOU KNOW MAKE A COMPARISON -- TO THE STATE AVERAGE AND YOU KNOW OTHER RELEVANT -- BENCHMARKS -- SO WE ARE BEGINNING THEIR PROCESS TO REALLY SEE FREAKING. BUILD ON WHAT'S BEEN DONE WITH A DASHBOARD BUT REALLY BRING THE DATA INTO A FORM THAT IT'S USABLE BY MANY PEOPLE. TO ADDRESS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT THE TRENDS ARE AND TO MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED INCIDENTS A CURRENT OBJECTIVE THAT'S THERE'S RIGHT OBJECTIVE IT WILL BE AND WE'RE BEGINNING IT NOW WILL WILL BE. CARRYING IT FORWARD SO WE GET WHERE WE NEED TO GO. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

AND DURING MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE -- I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON THE CONDITION STATE OF OUR STATE HOSPITALS ACTUALLY VISIT THEM. AND ALSO TO WORK -- RUBBER OTHERS REPRESENTING -- THE FOLKS AT THE ON FILL A VETERANS HOME. IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VETS GOT THE VERY BEST TREATMENT -- I CAME ONTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT APPEALS BOARD -- AT THE TAIL END OF THE RECESSION AT AT I THINK A LOT OF YOU KNOW THAT -- AT THE HEIGHT OF THE RECESSION. ARE THE OUR AGENCY WAS -- IT WAS A IN THE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES BEING EDUCATED AT THE HEIGHT OF THE RECESSION. AND I HAVE SERVE NOW FOR SIX YEARS ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT APPEALS BOARD. AND OUT ONE THING THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF IS THAT -- WE WERE ABLE -- TO AS THE RECESSION -- IT DATED AND OF PEOPLE AND WENT BACK TO WORK THAT WE ARE ABLE. TO MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN TERMS OF THE EDUCATION OF OUR CASES IN A MORE RAPID FASHION. THE APPEALS A PORTION OF THAT WE DO AT AT THE AT THE APPEALS LEVEL -- WE WENT PAPERLESS WHICH MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN OUR ABILITY TO ADJUDICATE CASES EFFICIENTLY. AND OVER THE YEARS SO WE'VE IN A LOT FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS NOW WE'VE MET AT DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS WHICH WAS A HUGE ISSUE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GOOD WORK IN TERMS OF MODERNIZING THE AGENCY -- AND WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK INTO THE TRAINING OF OUR STAFF.

AND SO WE NEED TO DO GOOD SUCCESSION PLANNING. AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG PROPONENT OF TRAINING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TRAIN ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WITH THE FACT THAT. OTHERS CONSTANTLY I CHANGES IN LABOR LAW EMPLOYMENT LAW. AND THE NEED TO GIVE THE VERY BEST SERVICE -- IN TERMS OF FAIRNESS AND IMPARTIALITY FOR THE PARTIES THAT COME BEFORE US SO THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. FEBRUARY THIRD IS A SENATOR BLOCK. WILL ALWAYS A CENTER WELCOME WELL THANK YOU AND AND IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK HERE IF I MAY TAKE A MOMENT JUST INTERESTS ARE STAFF FOR HERE BECAUSE SEVERAL CAME TO SUPPORT US. IF YOU GUYS DON'T MIND IT'S LIKE RAISE YOUR HAND WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE YOU -- ELENA GONZALEZ IS OUR CEO. MARK -- SAM IS OUR NEWLY HIRED CHIEF ATTORNEY CHIEF COUNSEL. JODY REMEDY IS OUR NEWLY HIRED CHIEF JUDGE OF APPELLANT OPERATIONS. ROB STILL LOSE THEIR CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER. LAURIE CURA SAKA IS OUR ASSISTANT DIRECTOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. JEFF WILL BE IS OUR CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER ALSO RECENTLY HIRED. BROWNFIELD IN IS NOT RECENTLY HIRED HE IS. AT THIS POINT OR NOT RETIRED A NEW CONTINUES TO BE CHIEF COUNSEL AND CAN HIT COX'S ARE ASSISTING COUNSEL SO THOSE ARE STAFF AND I WANT TO THANK THEM ALL FOR SUPPORTING US AND TING OM DEM OFFER WHAT THEY DO. TO MAKE MICHAEL AND MYSELF SUCCESSFUL IS THE BOARD MEMBERS -- VERY BRIEFLY JUST FOR SOME CONTACTS WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT ADMINISTRATIVE COURT SYSTEM AND WE'RE SET UP SOLELY TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS WHEN IT COMES TO DECISIONS MADE ON UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DISABILITY BENEFITS. AND PAYROLL TAX DECISIONS WHEN THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE AND THEY'RE MADE BY E. D. D.. BUT ANY OF THE PARTIES DISAGREE WITH THE DECISION SAY THAT APPEAL TO SEE WHY AB WHICH IS OUR ORGANIZATION. TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT LAST WEEK I ATTENDED THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR FOLKS TO DO WHAT MICHAEL AND I DO. AND WE ARE HUGE WE WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA STANDS OUT FROM OTHER STATES BUT ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE YOU AYE CLAIMS. IN THE COUNTRY COM OUT OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF EVERY. FIVE IN THE CASE LOAD FOR OUR ORGANIZATION IS GREATER THAN THE COMBINED CASELOAD OF THE THIRTY SMALLEST STATES IN THE UNION PUT TOGETHER. SO -- WE DO A LACK WERE BIG -- I'LL GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS THAT ARE KIND OF ANNUALLY AVERAGES ARE NOT EXACT FOR LAST YEAR BUT OVER THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS. WE HAVE ABOUT TWO MILLION UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS FILED ANNUALLY THOSE ARE FILED WITH THE EDT. EIGHTY D. MAKES A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER SOMEONE IS QUALIFIED FOR EMPLOYMENT OR NOT. AND 90% OF THOSE SCHOOL ALONG WITH EDIE'S DETERMINATION. THAT 10% WHO DISAGREE I THOUGHT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EITHER PARTY CAN FILE WITH OUR OFFICE A AN APPEAL. AND IT GOES TO ONE OF THIRTEEN DISTRICT OFFICES AROUND THE STATE. AND WE HAVE A JAY'S ADMINISTERED Là JUDGES IN THOSE THIRTEEN OFFICES AND THEY WILL DECIDE HOW AND THOSE APPEALS -- OF THOSE. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THIS APPELLATE DECISIONS MADE BY OUR OUR FIELD JUDGES ABOUT 10% ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND AND UP NOT AGREEING WITH THAT OUTCOME. AND THOSE TWENTY THOUSAND FILE A SECOND LEVEL OF PEEL WHICH COMES TO OUR BOARD MICHAEL AN IDEA AND REDUCES SOME OF YOU KNOW. AND TWO OTHER BOARD MEMBERS -- THE FIVE OF US STAND DETERMINE ON THOSE TWENTY THOUSAND CASES WHAT THE FINAL DECISION SHOULD BE. AND I THINK FINAL DECISION IS FINAL DECISION WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION. BECAUSE ALL OF THE PARTIES TO HAVE A RIGHT TO GO FROM US TO SUPERIOR COURT IF THEY DISAGREE WITH OUR DECISION. AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY LAST YEAR OUT OF TWENTY THOUSAND APPEALS THE CAME TO US. FEWER THAN TWENTY DISAGREE WITH OUR DECISION WENT TO THE APPELLATE COURT AND OF THOSE TWENTY ONLY TWO TO TWO TO THREE ONE ONE CASE IS STILL IN FLUX -- WERE OVERTURNED. SO WHEN YOU STARTED WITH TWO MILLION CASES FILED IN CALIFORNIA -- TWO MILLION CLAIMS AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND COME TO OUR ORGANIZATION TO SEE THAT ONLY TWO ENDED UP NAPPING RESOLVED TO THE SATISFACTION THE PARTIES -- WITHIN OUR SYSTEM SAYS GREAT THINGSI THINK CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE WORK THE FOLKS BEHIND ME DO BECAUSE AGAIN. WE HEAR CASES BUT THEY DO THE BULK OF THE WORK IN THE FOX THEY SUPERVISE. JUST BRIEFLY -- WHEN I GO AROUND THE STATE AND TALK TO OUR JUDGES I TALK ABOUT THREE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE FAST WE NEED BE FAIR AND WE NEED TO BE FRIENDLY? AND I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE SPEED BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS OR EMPLOYERS WHO ARE PUTTING OUT MONEY HAND TODAY SOMETIMES ND SMALL BUSINESSES CAN'T REALLY AFFORD. THEY NEED A FAST DECISION AS TO WHETHER IT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- AWARD OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND WE ARE FAST IN FACT FOR THE LAST -- SIX YEARS WE MET EVERY SINGLE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR TIMELINESS STANDARD. WHEN IT COMES TO BEING FAIR WE'VE MET FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS EVERY DEPARTMENT OF LABOR QUALITY STANDARDS? I THINK WHAT SPEAKS TUB FRIENDLINESS BECAUSE OUR JUDGES WE STRESSED OUR JUDGES TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT EVERYBODY CAN AGREE IF THEY LOSE A CAR NOT GONNA LIKE THE DECISION. IF THEY FEEL THEY HAVE THEIR FAIR DAY IN COURT IF THEY FEEL THEY'VE BEEN INSPECTED THEY PROBABLY WON'T APPEAL AND THAT'S WHY ARE PUBLIC NUMBERS ARE SO LOW -- SO THAT'S WE STRIVE TO DO AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS. THAT WAS ABOUT THE BEST OVERVIEW. I THINK I'VE EVER HEARD -- A VERY CONDENSED THANK YOU. MISTER BLOCK -- I HAVE TO STEP DOWN STAIRS TO SEE TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I'M GONNA ASK THE VICE CHAIRMAN TO TAKE OVER. AND SHOULD YOU BE SO CONCISE AND GONE BEFORE I COME BACK HI MY VOTE WILL BE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF BOTH OF YOU. OF COURSE -- I KNOW WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISUNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE TO STEP AWAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO GO TO QUESTIONS FROM THE CAN -- COMMITTEES THAT ARE MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND JUST WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. MR ALLEN YOU'VE BEEN ON THE BOARDS SO HAVE YOU MISTER BACCHUS CHAIR A LITTLE LESS TIME THAN MISTER ALLEN. LET ME START. WITH YOU MISTER ALLEN WITH THE QUESTION WE DISCUSSED WHEN WE WHEN WE MET THE OTHER DAY -- YOU BRING A UNIQUE. SKILL SET AS AN RN AS AN ATTORNEY. AS SOMEBODY WHO'S REPRESENTED LABOR BUT ALSO REPRESENTED -- ORGANIZATIONS AND THEN THE WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE WITH DIVERSE CONSTITUENT GROUPS. HOW DO YOU FIND THE BALANCE BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER RATES? WELL ESSENTIALLY I I THINK THAT ANYBODY WHO'S ACTUALLY JUDICATA CASE IS NOT THE FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO GET THE FACTS CORRECT. EXAMINE THE FACTS MAKE SURE YOU'RE YOU'RE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE THE FACTS UNDERSTOOD AND THAT THERE ARE CORRECT AND THEN. THE SECOND PART IS ESSENTIALLY TO MAKE SURE YOUR APPLYING THE APPLICABLE LAW THROUGH THOSE FACTS. IF YOU DO THAT -- IN A SENSE BEING BLIND TO WHETHER IT WILL -- WHO WERE THE PARTIES BUT BUT LOOKINGAT THE AT THE FAX IN THE IN THE APPLICABLE LAW USUALLY COME UP? A WITH THE RIGHT DECISION WE ARE FORTUNATE IN THE IN THE SENSE THAT WE WE DO HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSCRIPT AND ACTUAL RECORDINGS OF THE HEARINGS. AND MANY TIMES THAT IS HELPFUL WHEN THERE SEEMS TO BE A VERY CLOSE CALL TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON THOSE ESPECIALLY THE HEARINGS AT TIMES. WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE TO GET A GRANT WILL WE JUST RECENTLY UPGRADED OUR OUR ARE -- RECORDING DEVICES WHICH REALLY HAS IMPROVED OUR ABILITY TO HEAR THE TRANSCRIPTS BUT IN THE END IN A NUTSHELL THE THAT'S THE WAY I APPROACH THE CASES BECAUSE I FOUND -- AND THAT'S WAY WITH MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS WHEN THEY COME ON THE NEW ONE TAKE A TEACH THEM BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO GO WRONG WHEN YOU REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACTS AND APPLICABLE LAW. THANK YOU. IN A FOR MR BLOCK ALSO AS AN ATTORNEY AND AS AN ADMINISTRATOR IN HIGHER EDUCATION. NOW YOU'RE PLAYING NOT ONLY A CANNELLA JUDICIAL REQUIRES A JUDICIAL ROLE THAT YOU'RE ALSO. KIND OF THE CHIEF -- OFFICER OF OF THE APPEALS BOARD IN IN IN THE AGENCY. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE THE TRACK RECORD YOU SHARED OF THE AGENCY OR THE BOARDS HISTORY IS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE? MOVING FORWARD -- AND MISTER ALLEN MENTIONED 30% OF STAFF EMPLOYEES INCLUDING ALE JAY'S GETTING READY FOR RETIREMENT. HOW ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT LOSS AND MAYBE COMBINED WITH THAT ADDRESS A LITTLE BIT WHAT HAPPENS? IF WE DO FACE ANOTHER RECESSION IN A SPIKE IN DEMAND ON ET DE SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER. WE ARE A COUNTER CYCLICAL AT IS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GOOD WE HAVE MANY FEWER COME PEOPLE PLAN FOR EMPLOYMENT. WHEN THE ECONOMY IS BAD HER CASE -- GOES WAY UP AND THERE'S NOT THE TAX DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE CASES WE GET SO IT IS A CONCERN BOTH SUCCESSION PLANNING AND PLANNING FOR AN ECONOMIC TURNAROUND RECESSION. WHAT ARE WE DOING A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL OUR TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN -- PRETTY MUCH IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WE NEED TO MOVE T TO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND WE'RE WORKING NOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. I KNEW SYSTEMS TO UTILIZE TO WILL BRING US INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM IN A LOT OF A LOT OF HORROR STORIES ABOUT STATE ENTITIES THE TRY TO UPGRADE THEIR TECHNOLOGY AND FAIL -- THAT'S WHY WE DECIDED NOT TO TRY TO GO ON OUR OWN WITH OUR NEW TECHNOLOGY ALSO JEFF WILL BE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE PARTNERS TECHNOLOGY MAKE SURE WE GET THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST FOLKS IN THE STATE WORKING AT WE'RE ALSO SMALL ORGANIZATION SO. THE LIKELIHOOD OF ARE HAVING MAJOR PROBLEMS IS SMALLER -- IN ADDITION TO UPGRADING OUR TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL HELP US MORE EFFICIENTLY HANDLE CASES WE'VE ALSO SENT ALL OF OUR MANAGERS TO SIX SIGMA TRAINING THE LEAN SIX SIGMA TRAINING. WHICH THE WHOLE PURPOSE THERE REALLY IS CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT HOW TO CUT DOWN ON WASTE IN THE ORGANIZATION TERMS OF INEFFICIENCIES IN STEPS YOU TAKE THAT DON'T. HELP YOU GET TO YOUR GOAL -- SO THOSE MANAGERS ARE ALL NOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE TRAINED IN HOW TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO -- ADDITIONALLY WE'RE ALREADY PREPARING A TEST FOR NEW EMPLOYEES EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T NEED TO NEW EMPLOYEES RIGHT NOW WE ONE HAVE THE TEST READY TO GO SO THAT. YOU NEED TO TAKE A TEST TO BECOME A AN ALJ AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WE WANT TO HAVE THAT READY TO GO WHEN WE SEE THE ECONOMY STARTING TO DOWNTURN WE'RE ALSO VERY CLOSELY LIKE ALL OF YOU FOLLOWING ECONOMIC FIGURES SO THAT WE WILL. HAVE HOPEFULLY A JUMP RIGHT IN THE SOON AS THE ECONOMY STARTS TO TURN WE'LL GET ON IT. LESLIE WE'RE TRYING TO BECME MORE CONSUMER FRIENDLY AGAIN WITH TECHNOLOGY IN THAT. RATHER THAN HAVING A LOT OF BY EMAIL COMMUNICATION WITH OUR WITH THE PARTIES WITH THEIR CONSTITUENT GROUPS WE'RE TRYING TO BE ALMOST TOTALLY ONLINE WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DEVELOP A WEB PORTAL. THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO JUST GO ON TO OUR WEBSITE AND BE ABLE TO SEE THEIR DOCUMENTS SEE WHAT THEY NEED TO TURN AND RIGHT AWAY THEY'LL GET THEIR DECISIONS RIGHT AWAY. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE IN OUR OFFICES AROUND THE STATE KEY ASKS THE FOLKS CAN COME IN AND USED TO ACCESS THE TECHNOLOGY. ALONG WITH TRAIN STAFF DOWN THE ROAD TO HELP THEM ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE'RE DOING HAVING SAID THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN THE ECONOMY TURNS AROUND OUR MOST OF OUR DOLLARS COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TENDS TO RUN A YEAR OR TWO BEHIND. IN TERMS OF FUNDING. OF COURSE IS THE NEED TO FIND. OUT LIKE MANY OF US EXPERIENCE WE FIRST CAME IN THE LEGISLATURE IT'S COULD BE HIRED THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND WE'RE WE KNOW WHAT'S GONNA BE HARDWARE READY FOR THE CHALLENGE AND WE'LL. WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN TO BE READY. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AGAIN. I SHARE THE PRO TEM'S THINKING OF THE THOROUGHNESS OF BOTH OF YOUR ANSWERS IN. KIND OF MY TAKE AWAY YOUR ENTHUSIASM FOR THE WORK IN FOR THE ENTITY AND I THINK IT'S IT'S CONTAGIOUS AND THAT NEEDS TO COME FROM THE TOP IN. SOME OF THE WHAT'S THE CORRECT WORD DEANNA TRANSITIONS THAT YOU'VE HELPED OVERSEE WAS SOME OF YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM. I THINKER ALSO INVIGORATING -- FOR THE WHOLE. DEPARTMENT SO -- I THINK WE'RE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE YOU BOTH IN THE POSITIONS THAT YOU ARE I'LL BE SUPPORTING. YOUR CONFIRMATIONS TODAY IN AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SERVICE THE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU CENTER MINING SENATOR BATES. WELL MISTER ALLEN MISTER BLOCK I DON'T THINK I HAVE A QUESTION LEFT ASK YOU AND I'M. I THINK OUR BOARD IS AN INCREDIBLY GOOD HANDS BUT SOMETHING DID COME TO MIND WHEN YOU MENTIONED. THE APPEAL PROCESS -- IN THE ON GOING INTO THE APPEALS COURT. DOES THAT SUGGEST IN THERE ONLY TO IF I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO MR BLOCK. DOES THAT SUGGEST ANY CHANGE IN THE LAW IS YOU'RE LOOKING MATTER TRANS IN TERMS OF THE APPEALS. BY CHANGING THE ELIGIBILITY LOS I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT DO YOU REVIEW THAT IN TERMS OF ANY. TRANSSEXUAL YEAH THING DURING THE RECESSIONAL PERIOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING PRETTY DESPERATE AND MAYBE THE CLAIMS GO UP. MAYBE LAWS COULD BE A LITTLE MORE DISCRETIONARY I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST THINKING OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MINIMAL BY THE WAY THAT HAVE COME TO MY OFFICE FOR PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED I'M. YOU KNOW THAT THE TREND WE'RE SEEING I THINK IF IF THERE ARE ANY IS PROBABLY AN INCREASE IN CASES RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS WITH THE THE ME TOO MOVEMENT AND NOTORIETY THAT'S GOTTEN. MORE PEOPLE WE HAD A CASE RECENTLY WHERE A PARTY LAUGHTER EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE SHE WAS BEING HARASSED THE LOWER LEVEL JUDGE.

THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. SIR CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU. HOW IS THE -- UTILIZATION REVIEW PROCESS WORKING NOW. HOW'S IT WORKING -- IT BE A VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DETERMINE -- THE EFFICACY GIVEN WHERE I SIT NOW -- AS A PRACTITIONER -- THE SYSTEM SEEM. TO IT SEEMED TO DO WHAT IT WAS SET OUT TO DO WHICH WAS TO TRY TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. FOR A MEDICAL DISPUTES -- GIVEN THIS GIVEN THE TIMING OF WHEN THE LAW CAME OUT AND WHERE IT IS NOW YOU COULD. ARGUE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER DEPENDING ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY OR AN APPLICANT'S ATTORNEY BUT FROM WHERE I SIT -- I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY OF VALUE WAIT. HOW WELL IT'S WORKING IF I WOULD HAVE TO KIND OF LEAVE THAT TO THE DETERMINATION OF SAY PRACTITIONERS OR? OF THE ACTUAL SHOW STAKEHOLDERS IN THE U. R. ISSUES THEMSELVES DON'T REALLY GET TO YOUR LEVEL FOR DECISION OF THE BOARD NO BECAUSE AT MY LEVEL. I'M ONLY CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF PROCEDURAL HITCHES SO FOR JUDGES DETERMINED THAT THEY COULD RLE ON AN ISSUE FROM A YOU ARE DETERMINATION BECAUSE THE PROCESS WAS ON TIME WE FOR EXAMPLE OR DEFECTIVE IN SOME WAY. ONLY THEN WITH THE W. C. A. B. EVEN HAVE JURISDICTION TO LOOK AT THAT ISSUE SO I'M ONLY LOOKING AT IT FROM A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THINGS WERE DONE WITH DUE PROCESS THE TIMING AND SO FORTH BUT NOT IN TERMS OF THE SUBSTANCE OF DECIDING WHAT WAS. MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. FROM YOUR VANTAGE. AS YOU'RE SITTING AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID HERE. BUT FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT DOES IT APPEAR THAT THE BOARD IS APPROPRIATELY STAY THE BOARD ORGANIZATION THE ORGANIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AND THE LIKE. IS APPROPRIATELY STAFFED FOR THE CASELOAD THAT HAS THAT ALSO WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ANSWER I PROBABLY HAVE TO DEFER THAT TO YOU EITHER THE CHIEF JUDGE. OR POTENTIALLY THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD BUT IN MY POSITION ESPECIALLY HAVING BEEN ON THE BOARD ONLY ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MONTHS WOULD BE. VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO MAKE THAT KIND OF DETERMINATION REALIZE OUR DIFFICULT QUESTION.

SO A QUESTION ASKED EARLIER PANEL YOU COME FROM A DEFENSE BACKGROUND IN THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM. NOW YOU'RE IN IN DIFFERENT ROLE HOW DO YOU -- BRING NEUTRALITY AND OBJECTIVITY TO YOUR CURRENT POSITION WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE ON THE DEFENSE SIDE OF THE LEDGER. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION -- THE MAIN THING FOR ME TO DO IS TO JUST REMEMBER MY ROLE. OF MY ROLE IS TO LOOK AT HE CASES BROUGHT BEFORE ME. TO DETERMINE IF THE JUDGES WHO'VE MADE A DECISION HAVE DONE SO APPROPRIATELY INTERPRETING THE LAWS AS THEY SHOULD BE INTERPRETED -- THAT ALL THE PARTIES HAVE MADE THEIR ARGUMENTS IN THAT WE'VE FAIRLY CONSIDERED -- THE WEIGHT OF THOSE ARGUMENTS RELATIVE TO THE DECISION BEING MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE -- IN THAT REGARD IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT I BELIEVE. TO BE IMPARTIAL BECAUSE I'M NOT CONCERNED SO MUCH WITH THE OUTCOME IS I AM WITH THE PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT DECISION. THAT'S COME BEFORE US WAS MADE PROPERLY. THANK YOU AND THEN. JUST FOR MY FURTHER EDIFICATION HOW MANY TOTAL MEMBERS ARE ON THE APPEALS BOARD CURRENTLY THERE ARE SEVEN OF US. SEVEN IN IS -- VACANCY OR THAT'S THE TOTAL COMPLEMENT THAT IS THE TOTAL YEAH. AND THEN OF THOSE HOW MANY RETURNEES SIX SIX SO. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY ARE ATTORNEYS AND THERE'S A PUBLIC MEMBER HOW DO THEY ASSIGN CASES YOU GET. CASES ASSIGNED TO YOUR SAID AS A TEAM A MEMBER OF TWO WERE IN A THREE APPELLATE MEMBERS SHIRTS OF THE ASSIGNMENTS ARE MADE BY THE CHAIR. AND WE ARE REVIEWING CASES IN PANELS OF THREE SO AT ANY GIVEN TIME -- IF I WOULD JUST A NUMBER THE COMMISSIONERS ONE THROUGH SEVEN ON ANY GIVEN PANEL COMMISSIONERS ONE THREE AND FIVE WOULD LOOK AT A CASE OF THE NEXT CASE I'M LOOKING AT I MAY BE COMMISSIONER ONE BUT OLD. BE LOOKING AT IT WITH COMMISSIONERS FOUR AND THREE SO IT'S JUST AND WE TRY TO KEEP IT SORT OF A RANDOM PROCESS SO THAT THROUGH IS THAT DIVERSITY PERSPECTIVE ON ANY GIVEN CASE. IN ANY GIVEN CASE YEAR WORK IN WITH TWO OTHERS BUT IT IT'LL CHANGE FROM CASE TO CASE CORRECT RATE.
