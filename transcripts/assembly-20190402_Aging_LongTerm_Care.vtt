ARE PROVIDED TO OLDER ADULTS.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.003
THIS IS WHY ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:13.204
EIGHTY IS AN ESSENTIAL BILL

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:14.839
MOVING FORWARD.

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:16.107
THERE WAS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:17.642

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:27.652
OF AGING.

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:29.453
MUCH WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND THE

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.022
AGING SERVICES NETWORK WAS

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:33.591
MOBILIZED IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:34.191
STATE.

00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:36.661
OFFERING EVIDENCE BASED.

00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:38.329
DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.364
EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS.

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:42.099
IT IS SAID THAT DUE TO BUDGET

00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:43.834
SHORTFALLS IMPACTING MANY

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:45.269
PROGRAMS.

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:46.637
THE GOVERNOR RE DIRECTED THIS

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.573
FUNDING TO COUNTIES FOR MENTAL

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:50.207
HEALTH PREVENTION SERVICES AND

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:51.642
THIS IS WHERE WE RAN INTO SOME

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:53.277
ISSUES.

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.379
OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BID

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:56.847
TO HOST THE HEALTH SERVICES

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:58.649
FUNDS AND PROGRAMS IS AN

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.818
IMPERATIVE FOR BOTH THE

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:01.385
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:02.653
SERVICES.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.055
AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:06.490
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:07.825
COMMISSION.

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.460
THE STATE LEVEL POSITION WOULD

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:11.028
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:12.830
MENTAL HEALTH PLANS SUBMITTED

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.266
ARE REVIEWED TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:17.568
FUNDING REQUESTED WAS ACTUALLY

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:20.404
USED TO FUND THE PLAN SUBMITTED.

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.873
THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.842
IF A PLAN IMPLEMENTED CREATES AN

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.611
INNOVATIVE PROGRAM SOLVED IT

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:28.245
SHOULD BE SOMETHING TO BE SHARED

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:30.748
WITH OTHER COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.483
FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.851
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.187
RECOGNIZE THAT HALF THE COUNTIES

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:38.189
IN CALIFORNIA REPORT THAT THEY

00:37:38.255 --> 00:37:39.991
HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT FOR

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:42.393
THE SERVICES.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.961
THAT TO DO THAT.

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.497
THOSE THAT DO HAVE A ROBUST

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:48.099
PROGRAM.

00:37:48.165 --> 00:37:50.067
OTHERS HOWEVER TEND TO BELIEVE

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:52.503
THAT OLDER ADULTS ARE.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.172
ADULTS WHO WERE JUST OLD.

00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:56.507
AND THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:59.377
COMPLEX MEDICAL ISSUES THAT ALSO

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:00.344
NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:02.313
CONSIDERATION IN MENTAL HEALTH

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.148
PLANNING PROGRAMS AND SERVICE

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.716
DELIVERY.

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.218
MANY CAN'T COUNTIES DO NOT

00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:08.653
PURPOSELY REACH OUT TO OLDER

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:11.822
ADULTS TO OFFER NECESSARY

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:13.658
SPECIAL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS.

00:38:13.724 --> 00:38:15.593
I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT FROM MY

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.595
OWN PERSONAL RESEARCH THERE ARE

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:18.729
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE OF

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:20.197
CALIFORNIA THAT WILL SUBMIT A

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:22.099
PLAN. FOR THEIRMENTAL HEALTH

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.601

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:24.635
COUNTY.

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:25.936
AND THEY END UP USING THAT MONEY

00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:27.238
FOR SOMETHING ELSE THERE'S NO

00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:28.839
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HOW THAT

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:31.175
MONEY IS BEING SPENT WHICH IS

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:32.843
THIS WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.045
IN THE PAST THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:35.813
MENTAL HEALTH HAD PULLED TEAMS

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.049

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:44.622
TO BE IMPORTANT.

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.624
OLDER ADULTS NEED TO BE TREATED

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.759
EQUALLY WE ALL KNOW THE AGING

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:51.962

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:54.231

SOME OF THE FINDINGS FROM A

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:22.927
STUDY WE COMPLETED IN LATE

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:23.761

00:39:26.363 --> 00:39:27.765
AB.

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:28.899
FOR EIGHTY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.134
WERE CONTRACTED BY THE MENTAL

ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.872
EVALUATE HOW OLDER ADULTS WERE

00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:36.140
BEING SERVED BY THE PUBLIC

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:37.908
MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM.

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.410
AND WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:41.145
SINCE PASSAGE OF THE MENTAL

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.580
HEALTH SERVICES ACT OF TWO

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:43.814
THOUSAND AND FOUR TO MY

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.316
KNOWLEDGE THAT'S THE ONLY TIME

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:46.484
THAT OLDER ADULTS.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.618
AND THEIR EXPERIENCE UNDER THE

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:50.454
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:51.555
HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED.

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:52.957
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE FOUND

00:39:53.023 --> 00:39:54.425
THROUGH THE COURSE OF OUR STUDY.

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.093
WE FOUND THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.995
UNMET SERVICE NEEDS AND A VERY

00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:00.264
ON EVEN RESPONSE TO OLDER ADULTS

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.632
WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.667
WE FOUND VERY FEW EXAMPLES OF

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.136
PROGRAMS OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:06.670
THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY TAILORED

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.239
TO MEET THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:09.673
OLDER ADULTS AS SURELY AS

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.674
POINTED OUT.

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.209
OFTEN WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:13.811
CONDITIONS THAT REALLY CAN

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:15.346
COMPLICATE THE TREATMENT OF

00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:16.580
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES.

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.582
WE ALSO FOUND SERIOUS DEFICITS

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:20.351
IN THE GERIATRICS WORK FORCE

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:22.153
