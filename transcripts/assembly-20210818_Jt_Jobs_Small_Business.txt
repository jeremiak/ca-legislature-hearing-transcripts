I'D SURE CERVANTES PLEASE COULD YOU PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE HEARING AND FRAME THE KEY ISSUES. THAT WE'RE GOING TO DIVE INTO TODAY. THANK YOU MADAM TODAY'S HERE IS THIS. IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS. BY THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE THIRD HEARING FOR THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON JOBS. IN WHICH WE ARE EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF KOBE NINETEEN ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. IN TODAY'S HEARING WE WILL BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT A COMPONENT OF OUR INVESTIGATION WHILE. THE PANDEMIC IT'S CERTAINLY A SIGNIFICANT EVENT TO ALL BUSINESSES WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES FACED GREAT CHALLENGES PRIOR TO COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE ROUTINELY HAD AN EQUAL ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AS WELL AS TO PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WHICH SHOULD HAVE HELPED ADDRESS THE HISTORIC UNDER INVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME AREAS PUBLIC EDUCATION AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN GENERAL. SO AS WE CONSIDER HOW TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC ROADBLOCKS AS WELL AS THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES. DURING THE PANDEMIC. NATIONAL DATA IS NOW% AVAILABLE THAT SHOWS THE EXTREME DEGREE TO WHICH THE PANDEMIC HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR. BETWEEN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES DECLINED FORTY BUSINESSES DECLINED 32% AND ASIAN OWNED BUSINESSES DROPPED OVERALL. IN CALIFORNIA IT IS ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES. HAVE HAVE REALLY I'D SHUT THEIR DOORS PERMANENTLY EXCUSE ME. AMONG THOSE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THERE ARE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESSES OWNED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS THAT I WILL HIGHLIGHT. FIRST BUSINESSES OWNED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR TEND TO BE SMALLER AND OF A YOUNGER TENURE THAN BUSINESSES OVERALL. NOT SURPRISINGLY EARLY STAGE BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES TEND TO BE LESS RESILIENT IN TIMES OF ECONOMIC STRESS. SECOND ONE MINUTE MY NORTE ON BUSINESSES PREDOMINANTLY LIVE WITHIN THE BUSINESS SECTORS THAT HAVE LOWER BARRIERS TO ENTRY. WHICH ALSO HAPPENED TO BE THE SAME BUSINESS SECTORS THAT WERE HARDEST HIT DURING THE INITIAL MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING OUR FOOD OF SERVICES AND PERSONAL SERVICES SUCH AS HAIR SALONS. THIRD DATA SHOWS THAT WOMEN HAVE IN GENERAL FOR AND I'M EVEN BURDEN RELATIVE TO THE CARE OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND OLDER ADULTS WHO HAVE NEEDED ADDITIONAL CARE AND ATTENTION DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN OUR EARLIER HEARINGS COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE BRIEFED ON KEY ELEMENTS OF IT COULD BE NINETEEN ECONOMY INCLUDING IMPACTS ON SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY SECTORS AND STAKEHOLDER INITIATIVES INTENDED TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES RECOVERY. TODAY'S HEARING BUILDS ON MANY OF THESE SAME THEMES AND DELVES MORE DEEPLY DEEPLY INTO THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AND STRATEGIES TO REDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT WORK WE HAVE DIVIDED THE HEARING INTO THREE PARTS FOLLOWED BY PUBLIC COMMENT. IN THE FIRST PANEL WE WILL FOCUS ON THE GENERAL HEALTH AND CAPACITY OF WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES TO ADOPT TO THE KOBE NINETEEN ECONOMY. THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY CASE STUDIES ON HOW ONE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION IS USING SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED ETHNIC COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE CREATION OF A RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL FOOD INCUBATOR. IN THE FINAL PANEL THERE WILL BE NO FORMAL PRESENTATION WILL BE JUMPING RIGHT INTO A DIRECT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE PANELIST. THIS PANEL FEATURES TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND A REGIONAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION WHOSE MISSION IS TO EMPOWER WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. ALL TOLD I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY INFORMATIVE A COUPLE OF HOURS AND I WOULD LIKE TO TRANSITION IT BACK TO OUR CHAIR. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AS WE ALL KNOW AND- AS WE HEARD IN THE FIRST HEARING OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. WE KNOW THAT ATTICA NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN THIS STATE I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT NO ONE HAS FELT THE EFFECTS OF THIS PANDEMIC. TO THE DEGREE THAT ARE MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES HAPPEN AND CHAIRS. LAID OUT AS SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THAT AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES FACE AS WE REBUILD ANDBEGIN TO RECOVER. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OUR ABILITY TO STABILIZE THESE SMALLEST OF BUSINESSES ARE THESE WITH THIS LEASE MOST VULNERABLE SECTORS. AND POSITION TO THRIVE AS WE EMERGE FROM THIS PANDEMIC IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL NOT JUST TO THE WELFARE OF THESE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES BUT- FOR THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY- SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO DIVING INTO. TODAY'S CONVERSATION AND TO EXPLORING POLICY PROPOSALS AND SOLUTIONS THAT TIME THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS CAN AN AXE AND PUSH FORWARD IN THE CAPITAL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING A SWIFT I JUST AND EQUITABLE. RECOVERY AND DATA BEFORE WE GET STARTED I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE SPEAKERS YOU'RE GOING TO BE JOINING US HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO. SHARE YOUR EXPERTISE AND YOUR EXPERIENCE ON THIS TOPIC I YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS REALLY IMPORTANT AREA OF WORK REALLY. IS VALUED I FOUR WEEKS JUMP IN OUR FOR PANEL.

EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN THE ACCESS CODE IS. TWO FOUR TWO SIX TWO THREE SEVEN AND THIS PUBLIC ACCESS NUMBER IS ALSO POSTED ON THE JEDI WEBSITE I WE DO ANTICIPATE TAKING UP AGENDA ITEM FIVE PUBLIC TESTIMONY. AROUND THE FOUR O'CLOCK HOUR WE'VE SCHEDULED UP TO THIRTY MINUTES OF A HEARING FOR PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDER COMMENTS- AND WITH THAT I BELIEVE WE ARE READY TO DIVE INTO OUR FIRST PANEL AND- SURE CERVANTES ALTERNATE. BACK TO YOU TO WELCOME OUR SPEAKERS. IF OUR PANEL WAS CAN COME TO THE PRO. TAPE SO THAT CAN BE AGENDA ITEM. TO EXCELLENCE WE HAVE MASTER FIRST PANEL TO DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE IN STARTING AND GROWING THEIR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. JOINING US THIS AFTERNOON ARE THREE EXPERIENCED LEADERS WITHIN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY INCLUDING EUGENE CORNELIUS JUNIOR SENIOR DIRECTOR CENTER FOR THE REGIONAL ECONOMICS AND CALIFORNIA CENTER MILKEN INSTITUTE. WE HAVE NANCY SWIFT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JEFFERSON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE AND CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTER NETWORK AND POP FONG SHE DIED PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. IN ADDITION TO LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR SUBSEQUENT AGENDA ITEMS WE HAVE ALSO ASKED OUR PANELISTS TO IDENTIFY KEY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. BY THE END OF THE HEARING OUR GOALS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT MIX OF PROGRAMS ARE THEY SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED AND ARE THESE CHANGES ARE THERE ANY CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH I WILL BE PROVIDING A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF EACH PANELIST LET ME REMIND MEMBERS THAT THEY HAVE COPIES OF OUR PANELISTS BIOGRAPHIES AFTER GAS AS WELL AS POSTED ON THE HEARINGS WEBSITE. OUR FIRST PANELIST IS MISTER EUGENE CORNELIUS JUNIOR WHO SERVES AS THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR REGIONAL ECONOMICS AT THE MILKEN INSTITUTE WHERE HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS POLICY COORDINATION. PRIOR TO THIS ROLE HE HAS A DISTINGUISHED CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE MOST RECENTLY A SENIOR ADVISER TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AT THE U. S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION MISTER CORNELIUS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE GOTTEN. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THINK YOU'RE SIMPLY FOR INVITING US TO THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. THE CALL THE NINETEENTH TAMPA AND EMIC AND SUBSEQUENT LOCK DOWN AND DEMAND SHOCK RESULTED IN SHELTERING BUSINESSES BOTH TEMPORARILY AND PERMANENTLY. AMONG THE HARDEST HIT WERE SMALL BUSINESSES. ILL EQUIPPED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE SUDDEN DISRUPTION. AND EVEN FURTHER WAS WOMEN AND MINORITIES WHO DID NOT HAVE DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE RESOURCES NECESSARY AND AVAILABLE TO THEM AT THE TIME. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ROUGHLY LAOS BEGAN IN ABSOLUTELY FOREVER MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND COLLECTIVELY EMPLOY DECAL COMPLEX I'M SORRY LET ME START OVER THAT COLLECTIVELY EMPLOY. OVER SIX MILLION WORKERS NATIONALLY. WHAT INSURED WAS AN UNUSUALLY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. AND THAT PEAKED IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY X. FOURTEEN POINT 8% THE HIGHEST RATE OBSERVED SINCE DATA WAS COLLECTED BEGINNING IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT. NO THAT ISN'T SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TWO THIRDS OF ALL NEW JOBS CREATED AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND NINE WERE CREATED. BY SMALL BUSINESSES AND 40% OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WERE WOMEN AND OF THAT 40% WOMEN 70% WERE WOMEN OF COLOR. EDIT EMPLOYMENT IS LINKED TO THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE TEND TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE CULTURALLY OR SENSIBILITY OR CUTE OR LOCATED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SELF IN RESPONSE TO THIS ECONOMIC FALLOUT. OF THE CLOVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC POLICYMAKERS PASSED THE CULVERT A RELIEF AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT. A TWO POINT TWO TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIC STIMULUS. FROM THE VERY START THIS POLICY INTERVENTION WAS LIMITED IN THAT IT WAS REACTIVE. RATHER THAN PROACTIVE PRESCRIPTIVE VERSUS N. F. AND THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MACRO ECONOMIC TOOLS STIMULATING AGGRESSIVE DEMAND OR PROVIDING LIQUIDITY LIMITED THE ABILITY TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU HAVE THE FOR YOU A PRESENTATION THAT I HAVE MAPPED OUT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU TAKE THE TIME TO REALLY GO OVER THE DETAILS OF IT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS SAYS AND IT. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK A. WE HAVE. OVER FOUR POINT ONE MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES. OKAY. RIGHT THERE THANK YOU. A. N. SMALL BUSINESSES NATIONWIDE REPRESENTS 44% OF THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT SO THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER AN ESSENTIAL FOR OUR ECONOMY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD REPRESENT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES REPRESENT EMPLOYERS ROUGHLY FOUR POINT ONE MILLION BUSINESSES. AND THEY HAVE BEEN HIT HARD AND THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED A REVENUE DROP. IN THE MANAGER MAGNITUDE OF 45% DURING THE PERIOD OF JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND MAY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. WITH A THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE CLOSURE RATE DURING THE SAME TIME. THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA RANKS ELEVENTH AMONG FIFTIES EIGHT STATE AT FORTY EIGHT STATES. IN THE NATION NO OVERALL CLOSER. MEANWHILE. THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PARTICULARLY THE P. P. P. LONG PROGRAM AVERAGED ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF VOLUME OF THE PREVIOUS SB A LOANS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. THIS EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR THE STATE LEVEL ACTION TO HELP WITH THIS RECOVERY AND TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. AS WE DIVE DOWN INTO THOSE NUMBERS. I DON'T KNOW FOR A YEAR. WE WILL SEE THAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AVERAGED ABOUT 528% OF SB A LOANS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND THAT WAS THE SAME FOR THE PPP PROGRAM. IF YOU LOOK AT SPAGO FOR LOANS IF YOU LOOK AT SEVEN A. LOANS. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE P. P. P. LOANS THERE WAS A LITTLE UP TICK IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY. AS FAR AS P. P. LOANS BUT THE AMOUNT OF LOANS GIVEN TO THE- WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. BASED ON THIS DATA WE KNOW THAT. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE- REVENUES THAT WERE ACROSS THE STATE. IF WE COULD GO TO THE CHART WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE. CLINTON. BASED ON THESE INFORMATION BASED ON THE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT LACK OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS WHICH THE PPP PROGRAM PREDICATED ITSELF ON BUSINESSES HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND WOMEN NOT HAVING THOSE SIGNIFICATIVA LICENSES AS OTHERS THEY DISPROPORTIONATELY GOT NOT ONLY A LOWER AMOUNT. PERCENTAGE WISE BUT THEY GOT A LOWER DOLLAR AMOUNT IN IN LOANS TO HELP. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT CAN THE STATE LEGISLATOR WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES AND WHAT THESE COMMUNITY NEEDS IN GOING FORWARD AND THERE'S THESE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BREAK DOWN THE INDUSTRIES THAT THIS INVOLVED. BECAUSE THEY WERE 90% OF THIS EMPLOYMENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES OKAY FROM LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY. 67% OF THE WORKERS EMPLOYED IN THIS INDUSTRY ARE MINORITIES. INDUSTRIES IT THE INDUSTRY EMPLOYS DECLINED 19% BETWEEN JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND TEN TWENTY AND ENGINE TWENTY ONE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT PROFESSIONAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES INDUSTRY 81% OF EMPLOYMENT COMES FROM SMALL BUSINESSES AND 49% OF THE WORKERS IN THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE MINORITIES. THE INDUSTRY EMPLOYMENT DECLINE ALL LESS THAN 1% IN BETWEEN THE SAME PERIOD OF JANUARY TWENTIETH AND JANUARY AND JUNE. TWENTY ONE. SO THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE ARE LOW HANGING FRUIT WITHIN THE REACH OF THIS ASSEMBLY. THAT CAN BE DONE BECAUSE WE IN CALIFORNIA. REALLY HAVE DONE A LOT TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DISCREDIT THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND WHAT WE CAN IMPROVE ON. N. THE NUMBER ONE THING I THINK WE CAN DO IS USE TECHNOLOGY. WE CAN MAP ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO SMALL BUSINESSES COLLECTED DATA ORGANIZE A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATABASE AND MAINTAIN A WEBSITE WHICH COULD BE EITHER DONE BY A GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR THIRD PARTY- INDEPENDENT- GROUP OF CONTRACTORS THIS WILL BE TO PROVIDE READY AND CURRENT INFORMATION ON WHERE AVAILABLE CAPITAL IS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND RELATED CONTACT INFORMATION TO CONNECT THEM TO THE BANKERS AND LENDERS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IT. WITHIN THEIR EXIT OUT. THE SECOND THING WE COULD DO IS WE CAN PROVIDE REFUNDABLE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND START UP. SOME SMALL BUSINESSES CAN'T UTILIZED EXISTING R&amp;D TAX CREDIT BECAUSE THEY FACE LITTLE TO NO TAX BURDEN. PARTICULARLY START UPS AND THE PRE REVENUE STAGE. TARGETING POLICIES TO. REFINE A PERCENTAGE OF THAT I'M USED RESEARCH CREDIT. COULD FACILITATE GREATER INVESTMENT WITH THE POTENTIAL OF GENERATING FUTURE REVENUES. THE THIRD. RECOMMENDATION IS TO ENHANCE THE SMALL BUSINESS UTILIZATION PROGRAM. ELEVATE THE SMALL BUSINESS LIAISON ROLE ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN EVERY STATE AGENCY. TO A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITION WHICH IS CURRENTLY. I PART TIME DUTY OR OTHER ASSIGNED DUTY RIGHT- THEY DISPOSITION TO A SENIOR LEVEL MANAGEMENT POSITION WITH DIRECT REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CABINET LEVEL ADMINISTRATOR THUS PROVIDING A STRONG AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ACCOUNTABLE ADVOCATE TO SMALL BUSINESSES. AND A ONE DOLLAR DIRECTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO INTERSTATE OPERATIONS. THE MILKEN INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS A THINK TANK BASED HERE WITH THIRTY THREE YEAR THREE DECADES SORRY OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA RESEARCH A POLICY AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WE STAND BY YOU READY TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY WE CAN. BUT WE BELIEVE THESE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH IS LOW HANGING FRUIT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY AND CAN BE ABLE IMPLEMENTED AT THE AGENCY LEVEL LEVEL EVEN WITHOUT LEGISLATION. THANK YOU MISTER CORNELIUS I WILL- JUST HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL WE CONCLUDE WITH EACH OF OUR SPEAKERS. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS NANCY SWIFT WHO IS THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF JEFFERSON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE A PARTNER PROGRAM WHICH IS CELEBRATING ITS TWENTY FOURTH YEAR AND SERVING RURAL ENTREPRENEURS IN THE FAR NORTH OF CALIFORNIA MISS WEST ALSO SERVES AS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTER NETWORK. OVER HER THIRTY YEAR CAREER MISS SWIFT HAS DEVELOPED A KEEN INTEREST IN WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS AND HAS COMMITTED MUCH OF HER PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO ADVANCING WOMEN'S ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES MISSED WIFE PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU. I GUESS THE SOUND WAS LOST ON THIS PART OF THE VIDEO THIS IS AN EVENT WE HELD LAST OCTOBER AND IT ALWAYS BRINGS ME JOY TO SEE THE FACES OF THE BRAVE WOMEN WHO ARE NEVER DAUNTED BY ANY CHALLENGE. IT'S NOT IT'S ONLY ONE MINUTE DON'T WORRY. BRINGS THE FACES INTO OUR HEARING. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU TO BOTH CHAIRWOMAN PETRIE NORRIS AND CERVANTES FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN SHOWCASING THE IMPORTANCE OF TALKING ABOUT WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY THE VERY BUSINESSES THAT USE SO- ARTICULATELY DISCUSS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC ECONOMY. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY AND DISCUSSING WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM- AS MENTIONED BEFORE- MY HOME AND MY ROOTS ARE UP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS VERY SMOKY. RIGHT NOW. AND I'M ALSO CHAIR I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AND- AS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTER NETWORK AND SO I'M HERE TODAY. REPRESENTING THOSE MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AFFECTED BY THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. I'M PLEASED TO SHARE. THE WORK OF OUR NETWORK WHY WE BELIEVE WOMEN ARE KEY DRIVERS IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO SUPPORT WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU THE NETWORK IS DEDICATED TO SECURING ECONOMIC EQUITY AN ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN BY FOSTERING COLLABORATION AND GENERATING RESOURCES TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF ITS MEMBERS. WE ARE SIXTEEN CENTER STRONG BASE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND DESIGNATED BY THE US SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION WE PROVIDE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL AN ACCESS TO MARKETS SERVICES IN FOURTEEN LANGUAGES SPECIFICALLY TO UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS INCLUDING WOMEN MINORITIES. RURAL PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS LOW INCOME FOLKS VETERANS AND THOSE IMPACTED BY DISASTERS. YOU SAW THAT SHORT VIDEO OF OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SUCCESSES IN RAMPING UP TO SERVE SO MANY WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. WE CONSIDERED OURSELVES QUOTE ON QUOTE FIRST RESPONDERS AFTER MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY FOR WOMEN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES WE ARE PARTNERS WITH L'INDUSTRIE AND MANAGING A PORTAL OF OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND APPLICATIONS TO THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE SERVED OVER TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WAS UP 56% AND WE STARTED AND SUSTAINED OVER NINE THOUSAND JOBS  BUSINESSES THAT WAS UP A HUNDRED AND 50% LEVERAGED OVER FIFTY MILLION IN GRANTS AND LOANS. UP A HUNDRED AND 20% FROM THE YEAR BEFORE AND THAT IS TO UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR PROFILE STATEWIDE. SEVENTY SEVEN. FROM LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND 57% ARE BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR. YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR NETWORK MEMBERS ARE MOST ARE SERVING THE MOST VULNERABLE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THE STATE IS INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING BETTER. WOMEN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE KEY DRIVERS IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY OF CALIFORNIA THEY MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS AND IN PARTICULAR WOMEN OF COLOR ARE GENERATING NEW START UPS AT FASTER RATES THAN THEIR WHITE-MALE COUNTERPARTS. THROUGH THIS DOWNTURN WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY AS WAS STATED EARLIER. TO BE AN INDUSTRY'S MOST AFFECTED MOST LIKELY TO HAVE HAD WAITED YOU IMPLEMENT SUPPLEMENTING THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME. MOST LIKELY TO BE MANAGING A HOUSEHOLD AND THEIR FAMILY NEEDS. MOST LIKELY TO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILD CARE OPTIONS. MOST LIKELY WITH A NO SAVINGS OR ACCESS TO THE FINANCING THEY NEEDED TO RAMP UP THEIR SELF EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITY DURING THIS TIME. THE COMPOUND EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC CIRCUMSTANCES HAS CLEARLY HIT WOMEN OF COLOR THE HARDEST. SO WHY ARE THE DRIVERS IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WHEN ONE IN FOUR WOMEN RELY SOLELY ON THEIR BUSINESS HOUSEHOLD INCOME. AND THREE AND FOUR RELY AT ON AT LEAST HALF THEIR INCOME TO COME FROM THE BUSINESS WE MUST UNDERSTAND THESE BUSINESSES AND HOW TO SUPPORT THEM BETTER AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF BUSINESS REVENUE HAS ON THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME. THIS WILL HELP US BETTER INVEST IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUPPORTING FAMILIES AND HELPING CALIFORNIA RECOVER. AS A NETWORK WHAT WE IDENTIFY AS CHALLENGES. WE KNOW THAT CAPITALALONE GENERATES SOME IMPACT. WHEN COUPLED WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR TA FOR SHORT THE IMPACT IS FAR GREATER AND LONGER SUSTAINED WHEN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FACE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS THAT KEEP THEM FROM ACCESSING THE CAPITAL AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED THEY HAVE FEW MENTORS AND ARE OFTEN FEELING ISOLATED. IN ADDITION. AND VERY RELEVANT TODAY THE LOSS OF THE COLLECTIVE TWENTY NINE MILLION IN KERR'S ACT FUNDING THAT MY COLLEAGUE REFERRED TO EARLIER. THAT HAS ALLOWED THE STATE'S NETWORK OF SMALL BUSINESS SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT WERE FUNDED THROUGH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM. TO REACH INCREASED NUMBERS OF VULNERABLE BUSINESSES THIS LOSS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN. ALREADY SEEKING SERVICES TODAY. THIS IS A MOMENT TO BE REACHING OUT NOT PULLING BACK. AS POLICY MAKERS WHAT CAN YOU DO TODAY TO SUPPORT THESE WOMEN SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THE STATE HAS TO STRONG ASSETS ROOTED IN COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO BE. ENHANCED AND EXPANDED. THE CERTIFIED DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE SMALL BUSINESS CENTERS SUCH AS THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER AT THE PROCUREMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS THE MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS ARE EACH CREATIVELY SERVING THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS WELL. AND AT CAPACITY. THE TV PROVIDERS ARE SO DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES HARD TO UNDERSTAND COLLECTIVELY YET IT IS THE DIVERSITY OF APPROACH AND COMMUNITY AND IN LANGUAGE SERVICES THAT WILL UNLEASH THE SUCCESS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE BUSINESS OWNERS WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. STRUCTURE IS IN PLACE YET IS IN SOME DANGER OF SHRINKING INSTEAD OF EXPANDING AT THIS MOMENT. SO LEGISLATORS CAN CONSIDER A FEW THINGS- FROM THE NETWORK'S PERSPECTIVE IN SUPPORT OF THESE ASSETS- WE ASKED NUMBER ONE THAT THEY THAT YOU STILL LOOK FOR FUNDS TO DOUBLE THE S. B. TAPE CURRENT AMOUNT IN THE BUDGET. ALSO TO ESTABLISH A RESEARCH ARM THAT LOOKS AT THE IMPACT OF A SMALL BUSINESS RUN BY A WOMAN. ON THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE FAMILY WEALTH CREATION THAT KIND OF RESEARCH WILL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RULES THE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE PLAYING IN HELPING PEOPLE. GROW AND THRIVE. WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESS OWNERS ARE THE KEY DRIVERS IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY OF THE STATE. THESE VULNERABLE BUSINESSES MAY BE SMALL IN SIZE BUT THEY ARE MIGHTY IN THEIR ECONOMIC ROLE AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO HELP US RECOVER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU MISS WHERE AGAIN WE WILL HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF OUR THIRD PANELIST ARTHUR PENALISES PATPONG PUSHY GUY WHO HAS SERVED AS A PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE SACRAMENTO ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND AS A PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I WHICH SHE HELPED FORM INTO TWENTY TEN. MISSED FONG KUSHIDA IS RECOGNIZED AS AN ENTREPRENEURIAL LEADER DUE TO HER SKILLS AND FORMING COLLABORATIONS AMONG COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND IN HELPING TO BUILD BUILD PROGRAMS LIKE THE SACRAMENTO EXPORTS. THAT SERVES OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ASIAN PACIFIC ON BUSINESSES IN THE STATE AS WELL AS THE BROADER MINORITY OWNED BUSINESS COMMUNITY MISS FONG KUSHIDA PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN MADAM CHAIR CERVANTES AND PETRIE-NORRIS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE SURE TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. AS CHAIR SERVE OUR SAID WE DO. THE INTERESTS OF OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND. API OWN BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO OPERATE A SERIES OF FEDERAL AND STATE SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. CENTERS AND LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT DELIVER DIRECT SERVICES TO WOMEN. AND MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY THE UNDERSERVED. AND WE ARE HONORED TO BE HAVE BEEN INVITED TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY FOR YOU HERE TODAY. IS YOU KNOW. WE ARE NOW A MAJORITY MINORITY STATE. 63% A MINORITY IS WELL KNOWN THE CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE LARGEST SHARE OF MINORITY BUSINESS ENTERPRISES IN AMERICA SURPASSING ALL OTHER STATES HOWEVER WHAT IS LESS UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF KOBE NINETEEN IS THAT THE IMPACT OF ITS EFFECTS FELT AND CONTINUE TO FALL HARDEST ON WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS DIFFICULT IN ACCESSING CAPITAL AND GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS THAT BLOCK THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE ON EQUAL FOOTING ADDITIONALLY A SIGNIFICANT RISE OF HATE CRIMES HAS ONLY MADE CONDITIONS WORSE FOR MINORITY EMPLOYERS SIMPLY TRYING TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. AS CHAIR CERVANTES HIGHLIGHTED IN OPENING REMARKS AND DESPAIR IS WORTH REPEATING. WE NEED TO THE NATIONALBUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH BETWEEN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES DECLINED DECLINED 32% AN ASIAN OWNED BUSINESSES DROPPED 25% VERSUS THE 21% FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION OVERALL. SATTAR'S WHERE MINORITY BUSINESSES ARE CONCENTRATED LIKE RETAIL HOSPITALITY AND ENTERTAINMENT WOULD ESPECIALLY HIT HARD. WHAT WE MUST KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING PRE CLOVIS THE PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE IT BECAUSE SIMPLY MAKE THINGS DRAMATICALLY WORSE AND EXPOSE STARK INEQUITIES FOR MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. ACCESS TO CAPITAL HAS LONG BEEN A HUGE BARRIER TO MINORITY BUSINESS SUCCESS A RECENT BROOKINGS INSTITUTE STUDY FOUND THAT LARGE BANKS APPROVE ABOUT OWNERS. 50% OF THOSE NON STOP BY HISPANIC AND LATIN THAT'S BUSINESS OWNERS BUT JUST 29% SOUGHT BY BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS. FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS HAVE REPORTED FOR OVER A DECADE THAT MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO SHOW SIGNS OF LIMITED FINANCIAL HEALTH. BY FACTORS SUCH AS PROFITABILITY CREDIT SCORES. AND THE PROPENSITY TO USE RETAINED EARNINGS DOES THEIR PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE. THESE BUSINESSES WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE CLASSIFIED AS- AS AT RISK WERE DISTRESSED THEN NON MINORITY BUSINESS. OWNERS IF YOU CONSIDER LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS FIRST AND FOREMOST WE CANNOT STRESS HOW IMPORTANT WRAPAROUND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES ARE TO SERVICE SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS ASSIST BUSINESS OWNERS REGARDLESS OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION STATUS IN ACCESSING CAPITAL REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PROCUREMENT BUSINESS TO BUSINESS MATCH MAKING AND SO MUCH MORE. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AND IS MY COLLEAGUES WHO STATED THE SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM SB TAPE HAS PROVEN. I'M GONNA SAY THIS AGAIN HAS PROVEN TO BE A LIFELINE OF CRITICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. AND IT IS NOW UNDER FUNDED. AND THE STATE. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RUSSIA THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANTED-THE DREAM FUND WITHOUT THE STATE WIDE NETWORK OF SB EIGHT TAKE FROM FIGHTERS SB TABLE SUNSET. IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ACTION THE EXPANDED SUPPORT SERVICES TO ALL SMALL BUSINESSES WILL ALSO SEND SET AT THIS TIME. NOT ONLY SHOULD SB TAPE BE RENEWED BUT THE FUNDING SHOULD BE INCREASED TO REFLECT NOT ONLY THE CONTINUED GRWING NEEDS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES. BUT THE EXPANDED POOL OF NETWORK PROVIDERS SINCE TAPES INCEPTION. PROCUREMENT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES YOU ARE THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE LARGEST BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA PERIOD. AND THAT IS WHY CAL ASIAN ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA HISPANIC IN CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE COSPONSORED AB NINE FIFTEEN. WHICH SOME OF YOU HAVE GRACIOUSLY CO AUTHORED AND WE WANT TO THANK YOU ESPECIALLY CHAIR PETRIE-NORRIS A MEMBER GARCIA. EIGHTY NINE FIFTEEN WILL CODIFY THE STATE'S 25% SMALL BUSINESS PROCUREMENT GOAL WHICH BEGAN AS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE SCHWARZENEGGER ADMINISTRATION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. NOW WHILE WE KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN ACCESSING STATE CONTRACTS ESPECIALLY FOR MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AB NINE FIFTEEN IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION AT THE RIGHT TIME AND WITH HIS PASSAGE WE HOPE IT WILL BE THE FIRST. IN MANY STEPS TO PROVIDE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH. FINALLY YOUR COMMITTEE SHOULD CONSIDER SOLUTIONS FOR THOUGHTFUL REGULATORY MODERN TRANSLATION. AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY REDUNDANCIES THROUGHOUT THE BUREAUCRACY OUR SYSTEMATIC STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUCCESS REGARDLESS OF GENDER AND ETHNICITY. ACCESS IS A FORM OF EQUITY AND THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE VERY SERIOUS AND INTENTIONAL AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HONESTLY EVALUATE WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WITHIN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. CONSIDER WORKING WITH PARTNERS SUCH AS S. HERE TODAY THE TAKE NETWORK AND OTHERS TO CREATE LEGISLATION THAT MODERNIZES ARE COMPLICATED REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. IN A MEANINGFUL AND EQUITABLE WAY. THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AND THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY. THANK YOU MISS PARKER SHE THAT WE DO HAVE A FEW MOMENTS AFTER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP. WITH THE QUESTION OF MY OWN WE ARE HEARD FROM EACH OF OUR-PANELISTS ACCESS TO CAPITAL- AND AS WAS JUST MENTIONED WHICH IS A FORM OF EQUITY WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. DO ANY OF YOU HAVE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO WHAT ACTIONS EITHER THE LEGISLATURE OR THE ADMINISTRATION CAN TAKE TO REALLY MITIGATE THE DISPARITIES IN ACCESS AMONG THE DIFFERENT BUSINESS GROUPS. YES YES I THINK THAT WOULD. IN MY FIRST RECOMMENDATION WE TALKED ABOUT COLLECTING DATA. THE MAPPING OF CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IS KEY BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE A DATABASE OF AVAILABLE FUNDS WHOSE FUNDING WHAT KINDS OF BUSINESSES WHAT KINDS OF FIRMS. WHAT SIZE OF FIRMS. WHO WHERE ARE THEY ARE THEY THE ONES IF CALLS ARE THEY IN WHICH DAY IS THE BEST THING TO GO TO THIS DATABASE IS MAINTAINED BY THE BY THE- THE GOVERNMENT OR BY A THIRD PARTY IF THE GOVERNMENT. CHOOSES TO CONTRACTED OUT WOULD. BE AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR HOURS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO GO FROM BANK TO BANK TO BANK TO BANK TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT IS NEEDED OR WHO WILL BE THING IS THAT IT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD TIE IN TO WHAT YOU HEARD BY MY TWO OTHER COLLEAGUES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. IF WE DON'T GIVE THE SMALL BUSINESSES. A CENTRAL POINT. TO GO IF WE DON'T FIND AND EXPAND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BEEN AVAILABLE COMMUNITIES WITH CULTURALLY. SENSITIVE OF. B. HEY. PATTERNS IN IT THEN WE ARE TO LOSE THEM AT THE GATE. AND WE HAVE THAT BEAUTIFUL NETWORK WITHIN CALIFORNIA AS YOU HEAR FROM MY TWO COLLEAGUES STILL SUPPORTING THAT AND GVING THEM THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH AN WITH A WEB BASED. HERE'S WHERE THE LENDERS ARE HERE IS WHAT THE LENDERS ARE FINDING. THIS IS WHERE THEY ARE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. THAT WILL GET OVER THE LACK OF CONTACT AND IN RELATIONSHIPS THAT. MINORITIES AND WOMEN DIDN'T HAVE WHICH LED TO THEM NOT BE APPROVED M. S. N. ACCEPTED IN THE PAST. IF I COULD COMMENT. THE NETWORK OF CDFI HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS ACTUALLY DOING GOD'S WORK THESE ARE THE RETURN OF LENDERS THAT MANY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES- HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY ACCESS BECAUSE MANY OF OUR FOLKS DON'T QUALIFY FOR TRADITIONAL LENDING. I THINK THE CITY OF FIVE OR SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART. OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL THEY NEED TO BE FULLY FUNDED THEY NEED TO HAVE THE KIND OF SUPPORT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE FOLKS TO GO THERE NEED TO TYPE IT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE STATE GUARANTEE PROGRAM WHERE THE STATE GUARANTEES A PORTION. OF THE LOAN SHE GUYS HAVE GOT TO STREAMLINED APPLICATION PROCESS YOU JUST HAVE TO AND I DON'T KNOW- WE USED TO RUN A PEER TO PEER LENDING PROGRAM AND IT WAS A STATE GUARANTEE PROGRAM WE WORK THROUGH THE CDFI. THE PAPERWORK IN THE AMOUNT OF- OVERSIGHT REQUIRED ON THESE LOANS. VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR MINORITY SMALL BUSINESS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH SO I WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. PROGRAM STRAIGHTEN IT AND STREAMLINING. IF I MAY- I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT SOMETHING ELSE I THINK WE COULD DO HERE THERE WE HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED SOMEWHAT IN IN. CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S RISK MITIGATION CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS SUCH AS A GUARANTEED PROGRAM FROM THE STATE TREASURY OFFICE- CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM- AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC. THANK OR I THINK. THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE TA PROVIDERS THAT COULD NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT WE CAN USE. AND WE CAN ENHANCE AND WE CAN BUILD ON MAKING ACCESS TO CAPITAL MORE FAVORABLE TO WOMEN AND MINORITIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH SAY EACH OF OUR PANELISTS I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO ANY QUESTIONS MAYBE MEMBERS. SURE PETRIE-NORRIS AS WELL THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH FOR- FOR BEING HERE AND PROJECT PARTICULARLY FOR THE CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU HAVE THAT HAVE SHARED WITH US I JUST WANNA. DIVE INTO A COUPLE OF OTHERS SO- MS WEST AND MISS FONG CAN SHE GET YOU BOTH TALKED ABOUT AT. THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND- THE NEED TO EXPAND THE S. B. TAKE PROGRAM- I THINK IS MISTER TO YOUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. WE SHOULD DOUBLE THE PROGRAM'S COMING YEAR TO THIRTY FOUR MILLION- SIX TWO QUESTIONS ONE FOR. JUST YOU FIVE RESPOND BECAUSE SHE THAT WOULD THAT BE SIMILAR TO THE TARGET NUMBER YOU'D HAVE IN MIND- AND THEN SECOND FOR BOTH OF YOU CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND. WHAT WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES MEAN IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES IN THE STATE AND AT THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. THAT ARE ABLE TO BE SUPPORTIVE. YOU RECEIVED A LETTER THAT WAS DATED JULY FOURTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ONE. AND IT WAS ADDRESSED TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- AND I THINK IN THAT LETTER THERE WERE VERY SPECIFIC- METRICS IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING. NOW THAT PARTICULAR LETTER WAS FOCUSED ON. INCREASED TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE DREAM ACT ABOUT SEVEN MILLION. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ATTACHED TO THE DREAM ACT- PROGRAM MY DAY WAS ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD BUT NO DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NOW THINK ABOUT THIS FOR JUST A SECOND IF YOU'VE GOT CURRENT TATE PROVIDERS IN IN IN THE CURRENT ITERATION- TAPE WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO BE. ACCESSED BY- FOLKS THAT ALREADY RAN FEDERAL CENTERS IT WAS A MATCHING PROGRAM. THIS YEAR- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS OPENED UP TAPE TO OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS NON FEDERAL CENTERS WHICH- WHICH IS I THINK GOING TO ENHANCE THE PROGRAM BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW IS VERY BIG AND DIVERSE AND THERE ARE THAT PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. BESIDES THE FEDERALLY FUNDED CENTERS BUT THEN THINK ABOUT THAT FOR SECOND GOT SEVENTEEN MILLION THAT WILL GOING JUST TO THE FEDERALLY FUNDED CENTERS AND NOW YOU'VE EXPANDED THE PROGRAM BEYOND JUST. THE FOR THE FEDERALLY FUNDED CENTERS. BUT WITH NO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO COMBAT SO I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUES I MEAN I DO THINK THAT IT NEEDS TO BE FUNDED AND MADE A WHOLE. IS SEVENTEEN MILLION THE RIGHT NUMBER I WOULD DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE BUT I'M IN SUPPORT. OF THAT NUMBER. THANK YOU OF. IF WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN- ACTUALLY MY COMMENT WAS TO LOOK FOR THAT MONEY THIS TERM IF THERE'S ANY LAST DITCH EFFORT. IF THERE IS ONE OF THE LETTERS THAT UP. THAT WAS REFERRING TO DOCUMENTS THAT THE COST PER BUSINESS SERVICE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS SO YOU CAN DO THE MATH TO SEE HOW MANY BUSINESSES. WOULD BE SERVED AND IT IS ADMIRABLE IT'S IMPORTANT TO EXPAND THE POT OF. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS THAT'S A VERY BOLD AND IMPORTANT MOVE WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE DOUBLE THE FUNDING THAT WAS THAT WOULD BE LEVERAGING. ALL THE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED CENTERS. THEY'RE BASICALLY MATCHING THAT MONEY THEY'RE GETTING FROM THE STATE AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL CENTERS ARE ALSO PROVIDING MATCH SO WE'RE LEVERAGING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WE ARE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS OUT THERE SUPPORTING THIS VERY CREATIVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AT A VERY LOW COST. IN VERY HIGH TOUCH SERVICES SO- I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT ALL HANDS ON DECK RIGHT NOW ALL OF US ARE RECEIVING CALLS AND WE'RE NOT SURE HOW TO KEEP UP WITH THEM- WE HAVE PLEDGES TO RETURN A CALL TO SOMEBODY IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND TO SERVE THEM WITHIN SEVEN DAYS AND JUST IMAGINE THAT AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE LEARNING ABOUT US WHICH HAS BEEN TRUE- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT. PEOPLE SAID I HAD NO IDEA THERE WAS A NETWORK OUT HERE THAT CARE ABOUT ME WELL LET'S EXPAND THAT NOW. THANK YOU. IT CERTAINLY IT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE- AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT WITH HUGE RETURNS ON OFFER FOR THE STATE FARM CENTER. WILL BE WORKING WITH I THINK A NUMBER OF THE FOLKS HERE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO PUSH THAT FORWARD. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ARE WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHILD THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO ASK QUESTION OF- MISTER CORNELIUS BELIEVED EARLIER YOU MENTIONED THAT ONE OF THE LOW HANGING FRUIT SOLUTIONS- IS TO REFINE PART OF THE UNUSED RESEARCH CREDITS- SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT SO HOW WOULD THAT WORK IN REALITY I MEAN. SINCE SINCE THE- THE CREDITS ARE ACTUALLY UNUSED LET'S SEE BY START UPS OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE OFF HOW WOULD. YOU KNOW THAT CREDIT BE ALLOCATED TO THAT THE OTHER START OBSERVE. OR YOU KNOW OTHER PEOPLE. SO YOU YOU COULD TAKE THE HONEST. OF THE ARE AN INTAKE YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THERE'S A EXCELLENT QUESTION TO ASK. YOU COULD TAKE A PORTION OF THE ARGUES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT AND PROVIDE GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES IN THEIR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PRODUCT WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE. AND THAT COULD GENERATE NEW REVENUES FROM THE FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION- THAT FIRMS THAT ARE THERE. SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE TAKING. MONEY THAT IS ALREADY SET ASIDE A GREAT IS THAT ARE NOT BEING USED AND YOUR REAPPLYING THEM THROUGH A GRANT PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO TECHNICALLY WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THIS GROUP BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO REVENUE. OR THEIR START OUT BUT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF MAKING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IT REVENUES IF THEIR PRODUCT IS BROUGHT TO COMMERCIALIZATION. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO YOU WOULD TAKE THAT UNFORTUNATE PART MAKE IT INTO A GRANT TO OUR SMALL BUSINESS GIVE IT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS OR EVEN EVEN A LOW INTEREST LOANS. TO SMALL BUSINESS FOUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY NORMALLY WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO. SO THEN THERE'S ALREADY A POT OF MONEY OUT THERE THAT WE COULD TAP INTO AND IF SO HOW MUCH WITHOUT DOUBT IS NOT PART OF MONEY. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE AMOUNT OF THE POT OF MONEY BUT THERE IS A GREAT NUMBER A GOOD PERCENTAGE DOLLAR OF THE R. D. TAX CREDIT THAT IS THAT GOES UNUSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIENET NO QUESTIONS FROM ME MEMBERS I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK EACH OF OUR SPEAKERS TODAY FOR THEIR TIME IN THE- EXPRESS.

ACCESS TO CRITICAL FUNDING SOURCES. LOCAL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS HAVE SERVED A VITAL SUPPORT THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AS WE SEEK EVERITT BASKIN EQUITABLE RECOVERY.

IT IN. I THINK THAT SUMS IT UP. YOU KNOW ALARA BUSINESSES- THAT HAD BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES. WOULD HAVE DISAPPEAR IF IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT OF ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS- WHEN I WENT THERE THE FIRST TIME. THE VIOLENCE- A THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE OUT THERE I ASKED HOWARD THAT THEY WERE DOING AND THEY SAID THEY- LOST IN HOUR MONEY BECAUSE- WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED. THEY HAD ALREADY BOUGHT ALL THEIR SEAFOOD FOR THE LENT SEASON WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT HANNAH COMMUNITY LIKE OURS- IN. AND IT'S ALSO FOR THEM THE START OF THEIR- OTHER HIGH SEASON A BUSINESS IN. I ASKED YOU KNOW THERE'S HELP INTO THAT NEW I DON'T KNOW I AM. D. WAS LIKE SUPER OVERWHELM AND YOU KNOW I SAID OKAY- WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU- LONG STORY SHORT AFTER OUR STAFF WORKING WITH THEM VERY HARD. FIRST WE HELP THEM I'M. AND GET THE FIRST B. B. B.

BATTLE OF DAYS WAS ONLY POSSIBLE- BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO YOU KNOW. HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT WERE HELPING THEM AND- AND EACH STEP OF THE WAY BECAUSE THE PROCESS FOR. ANYBODY THAT IS GOING THROUGH. WHAT THEY WERE GOING IT WAS JUST OVERWHELMING AND WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT LACK THE BIRD LOVER LEATHER WE HELP NOT PARALYZE THE NAME IS THIS- AND SO FAR WE'VE DONE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS OF. THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT TO OUR COMMUNITY WHICH IS LARGELY A COMMUNITY OF FARMWORKERS AND YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CONTINUE TO SERVE HIGH VOLUME OF. BUSINESS SAYS AND WE KNOW THAT WITH THE NEW FUNDING COMING OUR WAY THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE REQUESTS FOR SERVICES- WE KNOW THAT ON. OUR ARE THERE WOULD BE A NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR SERVICES TRIPLE. AND YOU KNOW IN AND WE KNOW THAT ONCE. WE THE PEOPLE START LISTENING MORE ABOUT THE FUNDING THEY'RE GONNA CALL US. AND IT TAKES US ABOUT. ON AVERAGE OF TEN HOURS- TO SERVE. ONE BUSINESS FOR ONE OF THE PROGRAMS. SO AND WE HAD TO INCREASE OUR STAFFING AND WE'RE ANTICIPATING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INCREASE THE STAFFING. AGAIN. IN YOU KNOW CAN WE MOVE THE SLIDE. THANK YOU I SO. AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH NUMBER LIES NOT SOMETHING THAT DOES HAPPEN TO THEM THIS IS HAPPENED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN. ONE OF THE REASONS WE ABLE TO HELP THEM IS BECAUSE- FOR OVER FORTY YEARS OUR ORGANIZATION HAS WORKED VERY HARD. TO- BUILD- IN YOU KNOW OVER TIME A WHAT WE CONSIDER A THINK A- AN ACRE- LIKE THAT ENDED THE SYSTEM OF SERVICES AND RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE ABOUT TO BE. ABLE TO YOU KNOW SUCCEED IN BUSINESS A VERY VERY LARGE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE OUR ON FARM WORKERS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES THAT OUR ORGANIZATION'S MISSION IS TO PROMOTE EQUAL ACCESS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND IT WAS FUN THEN HAVING IN MIND. THE IDEA OF FARM WORKING FAMILIES BEING ABLE TO START A BUSINESS THAT WILL HELP THEM YOU KNOW TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC MOBILITY. I'M SO. A. N. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE DEVELOPED THE STRATEGY IN AN OUTWARD THAT IS THE KEY THERE IS ACCESS. AXIS TO. INFORMATION THE FACT THAT I WENT THERE AND TALKED TO THE OWNER THAT SHE KNEW ME EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT THERE WAS A TON OF INFORMATION OUT THERE IN THE NEWS EVERYWHERE BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE TRUST THE ESSENGER. CAME AND TALKED TO HER ABOUT THE PROGRAM IS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO MOVE THAT WE ALL OF OUR WORK AS MUCH. MARKETING WITH THE WITH THE ALWAYS HAPPENS BECAUSE SOMEONE COMES TO LAST BECAUSE OF WORD OF MOUTH. WE WORK WITH CERTAIN NETWORKS WE HAVE A NETWORK OF TOP HOW MANY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS ONCE WE SERVE TWO OF THEM TWENTY WILL COME THE NEXT DAY TO REQUEST SERVICES- ACCESS TO SUPPORTING SERVICES ACCESS TO SPACE- IN FOR THESE TWO- FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. OUR TEAM HAS TO BECOME AN ALLY.

THE COACHING- WE ARE ABLE TO DO PROVIDE SPACE FOR OUR INCUBATORS AND WE ARE ABLE TO- RESPOND THE WAY THAT WE WERE THEY HAVE RESPONDED TO THE STATE. AND- SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS. BECAUSE WE WANT THEM. BE ABLE TO SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY WHILE WE'VE DONE AND BE ABLE TO- TELL YOU. THAT IT IS WORK WHILE SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OURS AND- THANKS TO COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND TARNISHES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THIS ORGANIZATION NOT CAN WE MOVE THAT. AND AND OVER THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN CREATING THOSE SPACE THIS IS SUPPORTING AND HER PARTNERS- ONE EXAMPLE ONE EXAMPLE IS OUR BLESSING HE RETELLING CURATOR THAT IS LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN MONTEBELLO- WE HAVE THEIR SIXTEEN BUSINESSES SIXTEEN OF THEM ARE OWNED BY WOMEN. 90% OF THEM WENT THROUGH OUR IMPRESARIO PROGRAM WHICH IS A CORE EDUCATION BUSINESS TO THE PATIENT PROGRAM THAT WE OFFER AND THAT NOW WE HAVE TRANSITION ONLINE AND- WE ARE- ALSO GLAD THAT HE HAS IS THAT AN ASSET FOR THE COMMUNITY. WE ARE YOU THE RESULT IN PEOPLE COME TO US IS BECAUSE OF THE ALSO OUR ORGANIZATION IS VERY ENGAGE IN THE COMMUNITY WE JUST THE FINE EXAMPLE TWO WEEKS AGO WE HOSTED A- BAXEEN LANEY- DOING BY THE CLIENTS OF OUR- ENTERPRENEURS. AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE PEOPLE TRUST ALSO YOU KNOW OUR BUSINESSES- THE OTHER A BLAZE THEN IS THRIVING NOW AND IF WE WANT TO MOVE TO THE NEXT ONE IS THERE A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN INCUBATOR ASKED IF. YOU MAY NOW WHERE WE SERVE THE SENATE IS MODERATE IN SOME ANY TO COLONIES WHICH IS- I HAVE AN AREA THAT PRODUCES A LOT OF FOOD THAT HAS A BIG FOOD LOCATION. AND THAT HAS A LOT OF PRODUCTION OF ORGANIC. YOU KNOW. PRODUCTS AND- SO I IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WE ARE BUT THIRTEEN SORRY WE OPENED THIS COMMUNITY KITCHEN- WE CURRENTLY SERVE ABOUT THIRTY THIRTY FIVE BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE THERE BUT THE PLACE HAS BECOME MORE OF A- THE- FOOD CLUSTER- ASIDE FROM HOST POSTING ON FOOD ENTREPRENEURS- WE ALSO HAVE A- THE SMALL FARMER THAT- PRODUCES- THAT IT WAS ABLE TO CREATE A HIGH I WOULD HAVE. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY A BUILDING IN A CALL BACK IN LINE TO DO PROCESS OF VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS FROM THE LOCAL SMALL FARMS IF WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT ONE.

AT WE REFORM FOUNDED FORTY SIX YEARS AGO THAT WERE A NOT FOR PROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER- AND ACDC CAN WE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION THAT WORKS WITH A DIVERSE POPULATIONS OF THE STATE TO BUILD HEALTHY VIBRANT. AND SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS. AS MATCHING THE ANCHORS CDC'S PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN CREATING AND SAFEGUARDING SPACES INTEGRAL TO HEALTHY VIBRANT AND EQUITABLE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE ALSO OVERSEE A COMMERCIAL PERFIL YOU- THAT'S LARGELY LOCATED IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH A HISTORY OF DISINVESTMENT. BY PROVIDING BELOW MARKET RATE COMMERCIAL SPACE THE CDC SERVE AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING INTERFACES OPERATED BY FIRST TIME BUSINESS OWNERS AND A NURSE AND A REPRESENTANTES BURNERS. THE MAJORITY. OF WHICH ARE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE BEEN FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS SERVING AS A GATEWAY FOR NEWCOMERS IMMIGRANTS. IN THE CENTERS OF ART CULTURE AND FOOD. AND DAILY LIFE FOR COMMUNITIES THAT FRANKLY WEREN'T WELCOME TO ANYWHERE ELSE. CITY POLICY RECENTLY CAME TOGETHER WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER BASED IN THE FRUITVALE. NEIGHBORHOOD IN OAKLAND. CHINATOWN COMMUNITY AMONG CORPORATIONS HAVE DISCO. AND THE TENDERLOIN NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. TO HIGHLIGHT THE DEVASTATING IMPACT THAT THE PROLONGED PANDEMIS HAVING. ON OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE SERVE. AND THE CDC'S THEMSELVES. AMONG OUR FOR CV CDCS WE HAVE UP 240% SUSTAINED DECLINE IN RENT COLLECTIONS ARE PROJECTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL RENT LOSSES COMMERCIAL WENT LOSSES. THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE REALLY ANTICIPATED LOSSES TO CONTINUE. THE STEEP LOSSES ALONG WITH ENOUGH TAKEN COULD RELATED HEALTH AND SAFETY EXPENSES WOULD GENERATE A CASCADE OF FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. THE CITY SEES SEVEN FORCED TO FOR OWN LOAN PAYMENTS DRIVE DOWN EXISTING RESERVES LIMIT FUTURE RESERVE DEPOSITS FOR NEEDED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS AND MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CASH ADVANCES FROM A CORPORATE SERVERS. THIS PUTS THE CDC'S AND OUR COMMUNITY PROGRAMMING OR FOR A HOUSING WELL CULTURAL PLEASE KEEPING THAT WE SUPPORT. IN JEOPARDY. A CITY SEES THE FIGHT TO KEEP OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY SERVING BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS. IN ORDER TO DEFEND CITY C. PLACE KEEPERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND PRESERVE CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC SPACES. WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU MORE ABOUT- AT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR- IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR CDC'S. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU WELL LET ME START WITH THE QUESTION OF FOR THE WHOLE PANEL ABOUT DISPARITIES IN ACCESS SEEN RESOURCES FOR- NOT JUST YOURSELF BUT PRIORITIES FOR YOUR MEMBERS CAN YOU SHARE. MAYBE TO TAKE AWAYS ARE KEY MESSAGES YOU WANT TODAY ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO TAKE AWAY. AGAIN CAN YOU SHARE MAYBE TWO MESSAGES THAT YOU WANT OUR COMMITTEE TO TAKE AWAY TODAY. AND WE COULD START WITH WEATHER LIKE TO BEGIN. OKAY BEEN POINTED AT. I GUESS A COUPLE OF MESSAGES- IT WAS SAID BEFORE BUT AT THAT IN THERE ARE SOME RESOURCES OUT THERE AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES PRINTABLE SO WE'LL KNOW THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES ROLES MONTH- FORTIN BUT- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT- THOSE RESOURCES HAPPY PROVIDED IN A WAY THAT'S CULTURALLY COMPETENT. AND YOU'VE HEARD THAT ALREADY TODAY NOW PLAYING THIS TYPE OF- DIRECT ACCESS NEED IS BETWEEN TRUSTED PARTNERS SO WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED COMMERCIAL- TENANTS AGAINST MANY OF WHOM ARE REALLY STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THEM WITH I REALLY WANT TO ONE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. HELPING THEM- TO CHANGE THE WAY THEIR BUSINESSES ARE RUNNING SO GETTING THEM ONLINE- CONNECTING THEM WITH- THAT'LL BLOW OUT LOW COST CAPITAL SOURCES. OF MAKING SMALL GRANTS TO THEM. DOING IT IN- WILL DOUBLE- DOING IT IN A WAY THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO THEM MEETING THEM AT NIGHT- IT'S REALLY. TIME CONSUMING ONE ON ONE TYPE OF AID- THAT. THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THE CENTRAL. THE RESOURCES ARE THERE- BUT IT FEELS KINDA LIKE FROM MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUT IN A BOX. YOU GONNA MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO IT'S VERY HARD TO. FIFTEEN WHERE YOU NEED. I THINK- SOME BUSINESSES CAN HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUENESS. AND IF. WE COULD HAVE LIKE A WAY TO COLLECT HOW WHAT WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO RUTH GARCIA FROM THE- BUSINESS AS CENTER AND LOS ANGELES. AND HOW EXPLAINED TO HER MY SITUATION. THEN SHE WAS ABLE TO HE DON'T HAPPEN ON SOME THINGS TO HELP ME GET TO WHERE I NEEDED TO GET- BUT IF I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO PUT IT IN JUST TO SPEAK TO HER DIRECTLY AND EXPRESSED TO HER. WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND WHAT I NEEDED- I WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE SITTING HERE GOOD MY BUSINESS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET STARTED. CAN WE MAYBE EXPAND ON US HOPEFUL I WAS WONDERING MAYBE PERHAPS WEB PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS THAT- MAYBE UNINTENTIONALLY- WHICH INCLUDED YOU FROM PARTICIPATING AND GAINING ACCESS ARE YOU ABLE TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING PLACED IN A BOX WHAT. WHAT DO WE DO TO SOMEONE WITH MORE PROGRAMS IF LIKE I REACH OUT TO SOME BUT THE TRADITIONAL BANKING INSTITUTIONS AND THEY REQUIRE AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF TAX RETURNS. I'M A NEW BUSINESS ON OUR SITE AND I HAVE THAT. AND THEN SOME OF THE MOST OF THE STATE POGRAMS THE REQUIRED pRETURNS. SO AS SOON AS YOU'RE READING ON THE WEBSITE AND THAT'S LIKE A REQUIREMENT IS JUST LIKE DISCOURAGE YOU FROM ONE OF CONTINUE. PUSHING FORWARD. TO OBTAIN A LOAN OR TO GET THE HELP. YEAH AND I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I THINK A LOT OF OUR- A LOT OF MY TENANTS THAT HAD TROUBLE ACCESSING RESOURCES- I THINK- STATUS CAMINO ISSUE- I THINK- AGAIN PP P. WAS INITIALLY FOR MANY- COMMERCIAL TENANTS WHO DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH OR DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE RECORD KEEPING TO SHOW THE FOLLOWING REVENUE- AND- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT. IT IS SORT OF A GAP SO WE OURSELVES WENT OUT AND DID A LOT OF FUND RAISING. AND RAISE MONEY TO PROVIDE SMALL GRANTS TO SOME OF OUR TENANTS IN THE- THEN THE LIKE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE. THAT CAN HELP A LITTLE BIT BUT REALLY THEY NEED THEY NEED MORE THAN THAT- TO GET MORE THAN THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER RIGMAROLE ORDER TRY TO FIND THE SOURCE THAT'S NOT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MILLION DOLLARS. BY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS CAN BE VERY MEANINGFUL- PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- SOME BUSINESSES THAT ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE LIKE- RESTAURANTS WHERE- THEY DO HAVE TO- INVENTORY ISSUES- WITH A REALLY THERE THEY HAVE A CASH NEED THAT. DATA CAN BE LARGER THAN SOME OTHER ONES. IF I COULD TURN I MISS MADONNA I KNOW WHO'S JOINING US REMOTELY ARE THERE ARE TWO KEY MESSAGES YOU WOULD LIKE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO TAKE AWAY. YES WHERE I THINK FOR MANY- SMALL BUSINESSES WE TYPICALLY STRUGGLE WHERE AT LEAST YOU KNOW THE ONES OF I WAS THAT INCLUDES CONTACT WITH- CAPITAL. AND- AND INGROSSO CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO GROW AT THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS MY CLIENT BASE WIN GOLD- AND SO I HAD TO HAVE IT AND IN ORDER FOR ME TO HAVE ANY EFFECTIVELY- THERE WAS- THAT I NEEDED TO PURCHASE THAT I NEVER HAVE TO PURCHASE BEFORE WE HAVE TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD ENOUGH COMPUTERS WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE- INTERNET- AND WIFI CAPABILITIES- EXPECTATION. TO ENSURE THAT OUR CLIENTS THAT WERE MUCH NEEDED OF OUR SERVICES. HAD TRANSPORTATION TO COME TO OUR CENTRES AND THOSE ARE STUDENTS THAT WERE STRUGGLING PARTICULARLY IN MATH. AND DOING REMOTE TO DURING A REMOTE ACADEMIC SUPPORT WAS JUST- IT DIDN'T THAT WAS THE LEAST EFFECTIVE MEANS SO. WE REALLY DID HAVE- YOU KNOW JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE- YEP AND THEN MAKE IMPACT THAT. I WHEN APPLYING FOR PPP I CAN YOU BOTH THE PPP GRANTS AND FOR SBA LOANS- GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE DEMOCRATS NEED TO EDIT BUT THE REALITY WAS THAT- IT REALLY COVERED ONE MONTH RIGHT FOR US. AND SO ARE A LOT OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS- ARE THAT WAS JERRY- THERE WAS A LACK OF RESOURCES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE COULD HAVE REALLY TAPPED INTO NOT JEFF BARNES. BUT PROGRAMS IN WHICH- AT WORK CALL FIGHT TO OBTAIN. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE FEDERAL- WORK PROGRAMS THAT WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE ABLE TO TAP INTO- AND BE ABLE TO HIRE STUDENTS AT THE LOCAL UNIVERSITIES- TO HELP US. AND THAT THAT YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO US TO- THOSE FUNDS FOR DESIGNATED FOR. ON CAMPUS. JOBS I. SO WE- BUT A GREAT DEAL WE OPENED UP OUR DOORS A BIT MORE TO HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES- BUT THE REALITY BE BEHIND THAT IS THAT THERE WAS SOME RESTRICTIONS THERE TO- BUT I THINK FOR BRASS HURRIEDLY CAPITAL CONTINUES TO BE A STRUGGLE- STAFFING IS A HUGE- CHALLENGE FOR US RIGHT NOW. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HIRE THE- PEOPLE THAT WE TYPICALLY HIGHER- RIGHT NOW THE LABOR COST IS GONNA. SO EVERYTHING IN RELATIONS TO LABOR HAS GONE OUT FOR US WORKERS COMP INSURANCE IS GONNA- WE ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW WHERE NOW MOST FAMILIES ARE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL- WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TAP INTO THAT MARKET BUT IT CAN ARM WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF ITSELF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STREET FROM US WE SEE A BIG SIGN TO MAKE DONALD AND LARGER CORPORATIONS EITHER CAME IN- STUDENT LOANS OR INCREASE IN THEIR WAGES I WOULD. WE'RE WE'RE NOT COMPETITIVE ENOUGH SO- HIRING HAS BECOME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES. RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU MISTER DONALD ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FOR MY CHAIR. THAT'S WHY I ACTUALLY TO PICK UP ON ONE OF THE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HEARD IN OUR FIRST HOUSE ALSO ON MS FONG KUSHIDA ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT SHE POINTED TO WAS- AS THE NEED FOR REGULATORY MODERNIZATION AND REMOVING SYSTEMIC BARRIERS IN ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND COMPLIANCE- AND SHE SPECIFICALLY SPOKE OF THE NEED TO STREAMLINE. OUR LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. I'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON NAVIGATING THE STATE'S BUREAUCRACY AS PART OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN BEEN DOING ON NUMBER ONE AND THE NUMBER TWO ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC OTHER SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF STATE PROGRAMS THAT YOU THINK NEED TO BE STREAMLINED AND SIMPLIFIED TO MAKE ACCESS. EASIER. WELL YES I DIDN'T COME TO LIKE I SAID EARLIER THIS IS LIKE THE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO PUT IN A BOX AND IF WE CAN MAYBE HAVE LIKE FOUR BRAND NEW BUSINESSES AND THEN HERE'S YOUR PACKAGE THIS IS WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE- AND THEY BEGIN THAT TO. PEOPLE THAT WOULD IN THE INDUSTRY WITH A LITTLE LONGER MAYBE TWO THREE YEARS- BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES VERY DEPENDING ON HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN IN THE YOUR BUSINESS. YOU KNOW THE DAYS WHEN YOU USED TO WILL YOU BE IN TEN YEARS IN THE BUSINESS- SO I GUESS YOU KNOW LIKE IF THE REQUIREMENTS CAN BE. DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOUR START UP OR TWO YEARS THREE YEARS TEN YEARS I THINK IT'LL MAKE IT A LOT EASIER- THAN JUST GOING IN AND READ. IT MOST OF THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY DESCRIBED THE WHOLE PACKAGE AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS. FOR MANY YEARS. AND THEN SAUCE THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE REQUIREMENTS. THE YESTERDAY WE DIDN'T LIKE HOW FOR THOSE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO QUALIFY FOR. THEN THE COULD BE SOME OTHER OPTIONS. LIKE IF THEY PUT IT YOU KNOW FROM THE BEGINNING ON THE WEB SO LET'S JUST BREAK IT DOWN. SURVEYCOMPARE REYES SAID I THINK WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING IS THERE NEEDS TO BE- BETTER TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY. UP FRONT- RATHER THAN HAVE MAKING YOU GO DOWN THIS WINDING ROAD. HITTING A DEAD END. TAKING A TURN EXACTLY YES. THANK YOU. OTHER THOUGHTS CHECK I GUESS I WOULD ASK THAT- IN I THINK THAT- IS- REMAINS THERE. SO EXEMPLIFIED A LOT OF THESE POINTS BUT BASICALLY. A LOT OF OUR COMMERCIAL TENANTS THEY REALLY THEY REALLY NEED VERY CLOSE ONE ON ONE. HELP IN TRYING TO ACCESS PROGRAMS HOW TO EVEN MAKE APPLICATION- HOW DO YOU EVEN- THERE'S A LOT OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS THERE'S A LOT OF- GOT CULTURAL COMPETENCY ISSUES. AND THE WAY IN WHICH WE ENSURE THAT REALLY SOME OF OUR- OUR OUR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES CAN ACCESS THESE PROGRAMS IS WHEN THEY HAVE TRUSTED PARTNERS. SO THE CDC'S THE CDFI IS. THE NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATIONS THAT A LOT OF OUR- A LOT OF A BUSINESS IS ALREADY HAVE CONTACT WITH. I REALLY A GREAT ACCESS POINT TO HELP THEM- EIGHT YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT AS- SIMILAR TO YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AMBASSADORS NOW. SO IN OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO INCREASE THE VACCINATION RATES AMONG OUR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WE REALLY GETTING PEOPLE LITERALLY OUT ON THE STREETS- FRED WITH THEIR PEERS WHO ARE HELPING THEM- TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT VACCINATION. VERY SIMILAR WAY ON THE- ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN TO DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. AND ARE SUPER BUSY- SO WE'RE MEETING PEOPLE AT NIGHT. IN THEIR RESTAURANTS WE HAVE- WE HAVE A ONE OF OUR PARTNERS- IT'S CALLED GOOD GOOD EATS. AND IT'S REALLY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING- HELPING BUSINESSES. TRANSIT FOR THEIR WORK ON TO SOCIAL MEDIA THEY'RE LITERALLY GOING INTO THE RESTAURANTS TAKING PICTURES FOR THEM SHOWING THEM HOW TO USE YOU KNOW THE PHONE IN ORDER TO YOU KNOW REACH OUT AND TAKE ORDERS AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE HELPING THEM SET UP PORTLETS. BUT IT IT TAKES ONE ON ONE TIME INTENSIVE- CONNECTION WITH COMMUNITIES. AND IN YOUR VIEW IS THAT- IS IT A CHALLENGE OF OUR NETWORK OF TRUSTED PARTNERS NEEDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT YES ARE YOU ALSO NEED TO GROW OUR NETWORK. OF A FAD TRUSTED STATE PARTNERS EXACTLY- IS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE WE WENT OUT AND BASICALLY REYES GRANT MONEY FROM SOME BANKS TO DO IT- EIGHT EIGHT AND WE DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY AN EMERGENCY- WE NEEDED TO HELP OUR- COMMERCIAL TENANTS BECAUSE- WHERE THEIR LANDLORD AND- HAVE YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL SO THAT WE STATE SUCCESSFUL- BUT- IT IS ON SUCH A- LIMITED SCALE. YOU KNOW IT'S US A HUNDRED A HUNDRED TO BUSINESSES. HOW MANY OTHER BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME POSITION- WE ALSO I THINK. IN A SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THAT- YOU KNOW CAN WE BEAT THE THIRD DISPARITY IMPACT IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT I THINK IT'S BASICALLY A LOT OF OUR FIRST PANELIST TALKED ABOUT THAT. ARE ARE AGAIN OBSERVE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY BEEN HIT HARDEST BY COULD. HAVE REALLY BEEN HIT HARDEST BY A LOT OF THE- SHUT DOWN- AND IN CALIFORNIA OR CHINA TUNES- BRIDGEPORT WAS HIT EARLY- AND HAVE CONTINUED TO SUSTAIN- A LOT OF- REDUCTION IN THIS IS THAT IT. STEPS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND ENDANGERS THEIR CONTINUED SUSTAINABILITY. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR SORT OF CULTURAL CENTERS GO AWAY. SO WE REALLY NEED TO SUPPORT THEM. AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE QUICKLY BEYOND I'M WORRIED THAT WE WE'VE ENDED THE BUDGETARY SECESSION- AND- BUT YEAH WE REALLY NEED HELP FOR BUSINESSES. REALLY NOW. CARE AND MS MCCONNELL TO THEM I LIKE TO PICK IT BACK ON THAT- IN WHICH IMPLICIT IN PARTICULAR WITH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN. BUSINESS COMMUNITIES- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I NOTICED FOR MYSELF AS WELL AS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER- BUSINESSES. WAS EXACTLY THAT THE PARTNERSHIP- YOU OBTAIN FIND IN- AND EXCESSIVE AND ACCESS TO SOME OF THE FUNDING AND PROGRAMS- MOST OF THEM WENT THROUGH AB. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHETHER THEY WERE COMMUNITY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR OR BIG BANKS- I THINK THAT WAS THE LEAST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO GET THESE PROGRAMS WHO TO THE COMMUNITY- I TRULY THOUGHT THAT. IT WAS ALMOST- YEAH- YOU KNOW IT WITHOUT YOU KNOW. IT SOUNDED. THAT WAY INTENTIONAL AND SO I KNOW FOR MYSELF- GETTING ON FACEBOOK IN POSTING IN IN TRYING TO GET OUT TO THE COMMUNITY- TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN BLACK COMMUNITY THAT THERE IS FINDING OUT THERE IS EASE OF THE PROCESSES THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO TAKE- AND THEN THAT WAS YOU KNOW MY PARTICULAR EFFORT SO. I WANT TO FEEDBACK ON THAT COMMENT IS YOU KNOW CAN WE PARTNER. WITH UNITY ARE EXIST BUSINESS. WE IN THE CAN. NOT NECESSARILY BUSINESS NOT NECESSARILY- INSTITUTIONS THAT- AND THAT MAY BE- YOU KNOW DESIGNED FOR THIS BUT YOU KNOW I THE BARBER SHOP IN THE- YOU KNOW THE RESTAURANTSAND HOSTED HAVING A FORMAL- ACCESSIBILITY OR FORMAL PROCESS WHICH PEOPLE CAN UTILIZE ACCESS. PROGRAMS SIX FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND PARTICULARLY FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS- AS YOU KNOWLEDGE WITH THE DATA THAT'S BEEN SHOWN THROUGHOUT THE LAST FEW HOURS. WE ARE AT AN ORGANIC OR WE ARE A COMMUNITY IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY HARD EXTREMELY HARD AND WE STARTED STARTED. BEFORE CLOTHING AND DOWN IT JUST BASICALLY I GOT A LOT WORSE SO I THINK IN PARTICULAR BEING AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN. AND AT LEAST YOU KNOW NAVIGATING THROUGH THESE LAST SIXTY NINE. THAT WOULD BE ONE OF MY RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO- WORK WITH COMMUNITIES. AND COMMUNITY BUSINESSES SMALL COMMUNITY BUSINESSES TO HELP- ACCESSIBILITY TO SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU YEAH I WOULD AGREE SEEN AS WELL WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE SHAPE THESE PROGRAMS ARE RUN AMOUNT- TO ENSURE THAT. WE HAVE THE OUTCOMES AT THE TIME THAT WE WANT TO SEE FOR THE STATE. WELL WHY I DO WANT TO JUST KNOW WELL SAID- POINT TAKEN MISS MCDONALD I IN FACT. JURIED THESE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT MY STATE OFFICE HAS BEEN DOING IS DIRECTLY COLLEEN OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY- MEMBERS ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NONPROFITS AND- LETTING THEM KNOW. WHERE AND HOW THEY CAN APPLY I TO THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS- THAT THE STATE IS FINDING. DURING THESE CHALLENGES AND SO I JUST THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS I DO WANT TO TURN TO ANOTHER QUESTION FOR OUR PANELIST DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ANY OTHER WORDS OF ADVICE TO OTHER BUSINESS OWNERS OR ORGANIZATIONS NAVIGATING THE COVE IN NINETEEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. YES I WOULD DAM I WOULD SAY AB. HAS BECOME MY NEW WORDS FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS- WHERE YOU STARTED MAY NOT WHO ARE YOU AND- MY BIGGEST ADVICE TO YOU ALL SMALL BUSINESSES IS THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO MOVE OUTSIDE OF OUR COMFORT ZONE AND DO THINGS THAT WERE OR WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH AND DO THINGS THAT- ARE BIT MORE RISKIER. SO YOU KNOW TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ANY ADVICE- TO HELP. MINORITY AND WOMEN- SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE MY BY. YEAH THAT WOULD BE MY ADVICE. THANK A MISPRINT DONALD. ANY THOUGHTS FROM OUR TOUR THE PANELIST. YEAH I WOULD SAY TO REACH OUT. DON'T STAY QUIET. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE HELP HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO BE ABLE TO CROSS. THE WALLS. SO DON'T GIVE UP. JUST REACHING OUT- SOMEONE WILL LISTEN. SOMEONE WILL LISTEN PEOPLE DO LISTEN PEOPLE DON'T CARE AND- AND THEN IT WAS HARD FOR EVERYONE. AND I THINK IN SOME WAYS HE MADE US MORE AWARE OF THE NEEDS OF OTHERS. SO THIS IS THE TIME TO REALLY SPEAK OUT OF REACH OUT AND- LAKE NICOLE WAS SAYING YOU KNOW WITHIN US THE SMALL BUSINESSES WE SHOULD SUPPORT EACH OTHER'S BUSINESS. NOT JUST WILL NOT FINANCE- FINANCES ADDITIONS TO GIVE US A LOAN SO THE GRASS. BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO LIKE. GIVE YOUR BUSINESS HOW CAN. FOR A YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR KIDS AROUND THE- NICHOLS AREA AND YOU CAN TAKE ON THEIR BAG THE- YOU HAVE FRIENDS IN THAT AREA. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SUPPORT EACH OTHERS WITH THE WITH YOUR BUSINESS AND EVERY CHILD TO SPEAK UP. SO I WOULD REALLY AGREE WITH BOTH OF THOSE SENTIMENTS ANY TICKET THAT THE COMMUNICATION PORTION- IF THAT IS ESSENTIAL. AND DO IT AGAIN WELL OUR OUR OUR SMALL BUSINESS- ARE TENANTS AT THE THOSE THAT ARE THAT HAVE REACHED OUT TO US FOR THE ONES THAT WE ARE MOST ABLE TO HELP- AND CONNECT WITH- THEY'RE ALSO- ARE ABLE TO SORT OF LEARN FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND- AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK- I WOULD. I WOULD SAY THAT- AS- WE ALSO NEED TO WE ARE THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE PANDEMIC RIGHT I MEAN IT IT IS ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES SINCE BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND TO REALLY YOU KNOW WE- CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE OUR COMMUNITY TO- TO MASK UP WE- CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE OUR COMMUNITY TO- TO GET VACCINATED- AND WE WILL HELP THEM. THEM WITH THAT AND CONNECT THEM WITH RESOURCES- I THINK B. THE LAST PIECE THAT AGAIN IS THAT M. WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP ASKING FOR HELP- I MEAN YOU KNOW THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW PART OF WHAT MOTIVATES ME TO BE HERE IS TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST OUR COMMUNITY. BUT FRANKLY ALSO- TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND- AT THE- THE NONPROFIT CDCS WERE ALSO IN THIS BILL TO- AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR- FOR HELP FROM THE STATE- I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE IS SOME LEGISLATION THAT YOU GUYS ARE- LOOKING AT- AND I. GET THE NUMBER WRONG HERE BUT I THINK IT'S- LOOK FOR TONY FOR HELP HERE BUT IT'S LIKE AB ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN SO IT IS. RUNNING AROUND. ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN OKAY- BASICALLY- YOU KNOW AT. THAT YOU COULD SET A CREDIT- IN THE STATE- RELIEF- I WILL SAY TAXES WOULD BE GREAT- THERE ARE SOME INDIRECT MEANS BY WHICH MAYBE- THAT THE STATE CAN HELP US FINANCIALLY. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE HELPS THE NONPROFIT COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS AND WE CAN TURN AROUND AND CONTINUE TO HELP OUR- OUR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS AS WELL.

OF RANDY PETERS CATERING EVENT CENTER AND ONE OH FIVE NINE THREE- CATERING AND RESTAURANT BUSINESS IN ROSEVILLE. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE ROSEVILLE AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING YOU CAN THE UNITED CHAMBER ADVOCACY NETWORK A COALITION OF SEVEN LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND THE GREATER SACRAMENTO REGION- I JUST WANNA SAY FIRST THANK YOU LEGISLATIVE FOR BRINGING THIS ALL. TO EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS I'VE ENJOYED HEARING YOU ALL SPEAK. AND THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESSES- THE EXTENDED ENHANCE STATE AND FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE SLOWING OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND HINDERING BUSINESSES ABILITY TO BUILD BACK. EMPLOYER SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THE GOVERNMENT BENEFITS ARE COMPETING WITH PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS DISCOURAGING PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES FROM ACCEPTING OPEN POSITIONS. A RECENT YOU CAN EMPLOYER SURVEY FOUND THAT 78% OF EMPLOYERS HAVE CURRENT JOB OPENINGS AND AMONG THOSE 78% SAID THEY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY HIRING EMPLOYEES. AND THAT THAT GROUP FIFTY SIX SAID PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES WOULD PREFER TO ACCEPT CURRENT PUBLIC BENEFITS THAN ACCEPT THE JOB. ME PERSONALLY- WE'VE NOW HAD TO RUN NUMEROUS ADS THAT ARE VERY COSTLY AND WILL GAIN VERY LITTLE RESPONSE. AND WHEN WE DO GET A RESPONSE THEY DON'T EVEN SHOW UP FOR THE INTERVIEWS. IT'S BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT- WE'VE EVEN HAD TO THIS LAST WEEK CLOSE DOWN THE RESTAURANT FOR ONE FULL DAY BECAUSE THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE COMING TO WORK ARE EXHAUSTED. THEY'RE WORKING SIX DAYS DOUBLE SHIFTS. AND WE JUST FELT IT WAS RIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE COMPANY. IT'S HARDER TO PAY THE BILLS BUT IT'S BETTER FOR THEM PLEASE. AND WHAT WE FOUND SO FAR IS THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE THANKING US FOR IT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THESE EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING VERY LONG HOURS. LONG TIME ON THEIR FEET. SO IF THE LEGISLATURE WON'T ROLL THESE BENEFITS BACK AND STOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM COMPETING WITH THE SMALL BUSINESSES. FOR EMPLOYEES AT THE VERY LEAST WE SUGGEST LEGISLATOR PROVE IT- NO EXPANSION AND NO EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT SET OF BENEFITS. YOU ALL SAY THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE RESILIENT AND WE ARE. BUT WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT EMPLOYEES THANK YOU THANK YOU.
