SMITH HI. HELLO MOVES FOR WILL BE THE ROLL UPS AND PERHAPS A MEMBERS- GONNA MOVE ONTO OUR FIRST BILL. IN THE COMMITTEE AB SIX THIRTY ONE AUTHORS- MISTER BLOOM PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AB SIX THIRTY ONE TAKES AN EXISTING EXEMPTION THAT ALLOWS NONPROFIT LIVE STAGE THEATERS TO SERVE LIQUOR WITHOUT SERVING FOOD AND EXTENDS IT TO NONPROFIT CULTURAL FILM EXHIBITION COMPANIES. CURRENTLY NONPROFIT LIFE STAGE THEATERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE GIVEN AN EXEMPTION ALLOWING THEM TO APPLY FOR A LIQUOR LICENSE WITHOUT A REQUIREMENT FOR FOOD SERVICE HOWEVER THIS EXEMPTION DOES NOT COVER NONPROFIT CINEMAS WHICH DEPRIVES THEM OF THIS ECONOMIC BOOST. THAT FOR PROFIT THEATERS OTHERWISE ENJOY NONPROFIT CULTURAL FILM EXHIBITION COMPANIES ARE UNIQUE IN THAT THEY PROVIDE SCREENINGS OF CLASSIC FOREIGN INDEPENDENT AND RARE FILMS. THAT OFTEN DON'T APPEAR IN MAINSTREAM CINEMAS OR ON STREAMING SERVICES. YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW AT MIDNIGHT. A LOT OF DON'T KNOW WHY I KNOW THAT. SOMETIMES THEY EVEN HOST IN PERSON Q. AND A.'S WITH FILMMAKERS AND ACTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE OBJECTION THEATER IN MY DISTRICT ONCE HOSTED GEORGE LUCAS AT THE OPENING OF THE I. L. M. SKYWALKER SOUND TRIBUTE FEATURING RARE ACADEMY VISUAL EFFECTS. FROM THE STAR WARS FILMS AS WELL AS APPEARANCES BY BILL MURRAY INCIPIO COUPLE AFTER A SNEAK PREVIEW. OF LOST IN TRANSLATION. LAST YEAR I ENTERED TO SOME BILL AB THIRTY TO FIFTY NINE. BUT THE BILL WAS NOT HEARD IN COMMITTEE DUE TO COPE AT NINETEEN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RE INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION GIVEN THE FINANCIAL TOLL THAT NONPROFIT CULTURAL FILM EXHIBITION COMPANIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. PRIOR TO COPE WITH THERE WERE ONLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE. SUCH THEATERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE GIVING THESE THEATERS THIS EXEMPTION WOULD GIVE OF THEM A LITTLE BIT OF HELP TO MAKE UP FOR REVENUE LOST BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC CALLING IN TODAY'S TESTIFYING SUPPORT OUR DENNIS BARTOK OF AMERICAN CINEMA TEAK AND MIKE BREWER OF THE OUTCOME OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONSULTING. ARE YOU WITNESSES PROCEED. AS WITNESSES SIERRA MODERATOR DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN THE QUEUE. IT. WHAT'S ONE MORE TIME MODERATOR DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN THE QUEUE. SOUNDS LIKE WE MIGHT BE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES MISTER BLOOM- WE COULD MOVE ON TO. SUPPORTER OPPOSITION IF THEY DO COME ON WE CAN INCLUDE THEM- AS WE GO FORWARD IN THE PROCESS I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE MISTER CHAIR OKAY. SO WE'LL GO AND ASK FOR ANY OF SUPPORT OF. IN THE CHAMBER AS I SEE NONE. IN OPPOSITION THE CHAMBER IS SEEN NONE. OR ANYBODY IS IT ANY OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT IN THE TESTIMONY STATION OR OR THE VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM. HARIAN SEEING NONE. WE WILL TRY ONE MORE TIME FOR THE WITNESSES FOR MISTER BLOOM. MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE QUEUE FOR THIS BILL. I DON'T THINK OPERATORS AND- NOT HEARING THE OPERATOR. MISTER BLOOM IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES% FROM THE LAST- COMMITTEE HEARING IN THIS IN THIS ROOM- AND CONNECTING TO THE NEW ONE SO ARE WE OKAY WITH MOVING FORWARD. WITH THE PROCESS WOULD YOU LIKE TO RECESS AND WAIT FOR YOUR- CALL I DON'T THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WANT ME TO DO THAT TO THEM. YES I DO WANT TO GIVE YOU EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR BUILDING H<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; YOU&lt;/c&gt;</u> FEEL FIT AT PRESENT PRECIADO THAT- MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD MAKE A BRIEF CLOSING STATEMENT- I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES OKAY WE'LL MOVE FOR TO COMMIT QUESTIONS OF ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE AUTHOR.

ONLY RECENTLY THERE WAS A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A STEVEN SPIELBERG. A YOUNG STEVEN SPIELBERG WAS INSPIRED TO BECOME A DIRECTOR AFTER WATCHING LAWRENCE OF ARABIA- ON THE BIG SCREEN AT A MOVIE THEATER. TODAY THE ONLY PLACE YOU COULD GO TO SEE THOSE FILMS ON THE BIG SCREEN IS THAT THE THEATERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEIR IMPORTANT- FOR US TO PRESERVE- THIS IS A SMALL MEASURE THAT WILL HELP THEM AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM WE DO HAVE A FIRST I BELIEVE FROM MR MATHESON'S.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE A BILL THAT IMPROVES ACCOUNTABILITY OF BUSINESS LICENSES WHO SELL MINORS WITH ALCOHOL BY BRINGING PARITY TO THIS TESTIMONY STANDS FOR CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CRIMINAL TRIAL IN WHICH IT IS ALLEGED THAT ALCOHOL WAS SOLD OR PROVIDED TO A PERSON UNDER AGE CAN PROCEED WITHOUT THE TESTIMONY OF THE BINA HOWEVER DURING THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS THE MINOR IS REQUIRED TO BE PRESENT EVEN IF. THEIR TESTIMONY IS NOT NECESSARY TO PROVE THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE NOT ONLY IS THIS PRACTICE IN CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS FOR THE SAME VIOLATION BUT INSTANCES UP TOBACCO AND CANNABIS SALES ALSO DO NOT REQUIRE MINERS TO TESTIFY ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS FURTHERMORE. BECAUSE MINE IS OFTEN FEAR CRIMINAL CITATION OR EVEN PROSECUTION FOR PURCHASING OR RECEIVING ALCOHOL WHILE UNDERAGE THEY FREQUENTLY DO NOT ATTEND MINISTRY TO HEARINGS THIS RESULT IN THE DISMISSAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNLESS THE SUSPECTED LICENSEE.
