CHEMISTRY IS FOR THE BETTER IS

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:15.274 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW?

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.075 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN THOUGH ON THE FEDERAL

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:18.411 region:rollup2
LEVEL THEY DON'T SEEM TO

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:19.846 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:21.214 region:rollup2
PROGRESS WE'VE BEEN MAKING WE'RE

00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:24.150 region:rollup2
GONNA SEE CONTINUING CALIFORNIA

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:25.551 region:rollup2
TO MAKE PROGRESS MITIGATING AND

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.053 region:rollup2
ADAPTING TO THE EFFECTS OF OUR

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:29.856 region:rollup2
CHANGING CLIMATE.

00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:31.290 region:rollup2
AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION HYPOXIA

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:32.692 region:rollup2
THE CHANGING CHEMISTRY IN THE

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.460 region:rollup2
OCEAN IS CLEARLY.

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:35.495 region:rollup2
AT ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA THAT

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.164 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING ON.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:39.332 region:rollup2
AND.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:41.167 region:rollup2
SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION FOR

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:43.002 region:rollup2
ME IS ALSO VERY INTERESTING

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.003 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. BACK IN MY DAYS ARE

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:45.204 region:rollup2
COASTAL COMMISSION WE ARE CHINA

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:47.006 region:rollup2
PROTECTS

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:50.176 region:rollup2
AND MANAGE A LOT OF THE EELGRASS

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:52.078 region:rollup2
BECAME AN IMPORTANT PART. OF.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.712 region:rollup2
PERMIT DISCUSSIONS AROUND

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:54.380 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:55.314 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.184 region:rollup2
AND ONE THINKS IT'S VERY TRUE AS

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:59.018 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.152 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT HELP OUR ENVIRONMENT

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.120 region:rollup2
WE GO PLANT A TREE.

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:02.288 region:rollup2
DOES NOT WORK THE SAME FOR

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.123 region:rollup2
SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:05.725 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WE'RE

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:07.460 region:rollup2
GONNA MITIGATE THE LOSS OF YOUR

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:09.762 region:rollup2
GRASS IN ONE PLACE. PLANTED IN

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.564 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND EXPECTED SUCCESS IN

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:12.999 region:rollup2
FACT A LOT OF THE MEDICATIONS

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:14.066 region:rollup2
THAT THE COAST COMMISSION LOOKED

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:16.135 region:rollup2
AT OVER THE YEARS WERE

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:17.169 region:rollup2
MARGINALLY SUCCESSFUL.

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:18.571 region:rollup2
SO EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:20.640 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS PERMITTED

00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:21.874 region:rollup2
BASED ON A CERTAIN.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.742 region:rollup2
MITIGATION STRATEGYTHIS

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.709 region:rollup2
MITIGATION STRATEGIES DO NOT

00:17:22.742 --> 00:17:25.511 region:rollup2
ALWAYS HAVE.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:27.747 region:rollup2
THE FACTS

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:29.549 region:rollup2
AND SO THE MORE WE COULD WORK TO

00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:31.150 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COURT OF

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:33.185 region:rollup2
VEGETATION WORKS.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.721 region:rollup2
WHERE IT WORKS AND THOUGH THE

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:37.523 region:rollup2
BROADER IMPACTS IT CAN HAVE ON

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:39.492 region:rollup2
PROTECTING OUR OCEANS AND OUR

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:40.893 region:rollup2
COASTAL RESOURCES I THINK THE

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:43.362 region:rollup2
MORE SIGNIFICANT IT ADDS?

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.597 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER.

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:46.465 region:rollup2
LOGISTICAL REASON OF ARE HAPPY

00:17:44.597 --> 00:17:48.401 region:rollup2
TO BE DOING THIS HERE TODAY IS I

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:50.169 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:52.338 region:rollup2
WE SINCE I COME FROM COUNTY AWAY

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:53.406 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION THE

00:17:52.338 --> 00:17:54.040 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE IN THE JUDICIAL ARE

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.641 region:rollup2
ALSO OF TIED TOGETHER.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.243 region:rollup2
THAT

00:17:55.641 --> 00:18:00.279 region:rollup2
THREE SEPARATE BRANCHES OF

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:02.815 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT DON'T ALWAYS WORK

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:03.749 region:rollup2
THAT WELL TOGETHER AND OSHA

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:04.817 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION TAP COUNSEL DOES A

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.085 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD JOB A LOT OF THE STATE

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:07.053 region:rollup2

THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHAT

00:18:07.687 --> 00:18:11.257 region:rollup2
SOME THE CHALLENGES ARE.

00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:12.258 region:rollup2
BUT I WANTED TO BRING THESE

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:14.694 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS INTO THE

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:16.128 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN BE A

00:18:14.694 --> 00:18:17.563 region:rollup2
PART OF SOME OF THE IDEAS THE

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:18.965 region:rollup2
POLICY CHANGES THAT THE

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:19.799 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING ON.

00:18:18.965 --> 00:18:21.701 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTAND REALLY HOW TO BE

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:23.736 region:rollup2
YOUR PARTNERS.

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:26.305 region:rollup2
IN WORKING IN ASSURING WERE

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:27.707 region:rollup2
WORKING STRATEGIES TO BETTER

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:29.942 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT TO

00:18:27.707 --> 00:18:33.679 region:rollup2
ADAPTS TO MITIGATE TO MANAGE AS

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:34.814 region:rollup2
WE MOVE FORWARD. AND IF

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.415 region:rollup2
ANYBODY'S BEEN INVOLVED IN

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:37.950 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS YOU KNOW

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:39.418 region:rollup2
THAT MEMBERS TO COME AND GO.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.119 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEING WEB CAST IT'S

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:41.921 region:rollup2
BEING TELEVISED IT'S IT'S

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:43.589 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE SO WE ARE CREATING A

00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:45.224 region:rollup2
VERY A PORTENT LEGISLATIVE

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:47.326 region:rollup2
RECORD HERE TODAY.

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:48.394 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE A LOT

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:49.495 region:rollup2
OF FOLKS SHOWING UP WHERE THE

00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:51.097 region:rollup2
SHOPS RADICALLY BASED ON

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:51.864 region:rollup2
SCHEDULES THIS IS STILL AN

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:53.632 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF HOW WE CONDUCT

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:54.834 region:rollup2
OUR BUSINESS.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.935 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES

MEASURES.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.373 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR PRODUCTIVE WAYS THAT

00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:01.607 region:rollup2
WE CAN IN OUR LEGISLATIVE

00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:04.543 region:rollup2
CONTACTS

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:06.078 region:rollup2
BE OF ASSISTANCE IN.

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:09.382 region:rollup2
THAT MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:10.883 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND THAT'S WHY DOING

00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:11.417 region:rollup2
THIS AND SAID CONTEXT I THINK IS

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.351 region:rollup2
SO IMPORTANT.

00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:14.420 region:rollup2
SO LET'S START WITH THE HEARING.

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:15.388 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.722 region:rollup2

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:23.182 region:rollup2
I CONVENED.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:24.850 region:rollup2
A PANEL A SCIENTIFIC PANEL BUT

00:21:23.182 --> 00:21:28.154 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:31.791 region:rollup2
AND HAS A WASHINGTON AND OREGON.

00:21:28.154 --> 00:21:33.492 region:rollup2
WERE HAVING VERY SIMILAR ISSUES.

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:35.161 region:rollup2
AND PARTICULARLY WASHINGTON WITH

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:36.795 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THEIR

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:39.331 region:rollup2
SHELLFISH INDUSTRY IN PUGET

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:41.600 region:rollup2
SOUND. IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:44.570 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE EFFORT MERGED.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.106 region:rollup2
INTO A THREE STATE EFFORT

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:50.176 region:rollup2
AND IT LED TO A STUDY.

00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:51.911 region:rollup2
THAT JUNE WAS DONE AND RELEASED

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:53.312 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND IT WAS A

00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:55.014 region:rollup2
VERY UNIQUE STUDY BECAUSE MANY

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:57.116 region:rollup2
TIMES.

00:21:55.014 --> 00:21:59.151 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT THE SCIENCE AND USE.

00:21:57.116 --> 00:22:00.553 region:rollup2
HERE'S THE SCIENCE OF WHAT'S

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:02.688 region:rollup2
GOING ON WITH OCEAN

00:22:00.553 --> 00:22:05.191 region:rollup2
ACIDIFICATION BUT YOU DON'T

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:07.092 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY GET ATTACHED TO IT

00:22:05.191 --> 00:22:08.394 region:rollup2
WHAT EARLY ACTIONS ARE THAT YOU

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:11.397 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE.

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:12.832 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS STUDY DID

00:22:11.397 --> 00:22:15.234 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:17.937 region:rollup2
THAT WORKED ON THAT THAT ARE

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:19.572 region:rollup2
GOING TO CONFORM YOU AND. AS A

00:22:17.937 --> 00:22:21.473 region:rollup2
LAY PERSON THAT WERE ALL INDS

00:22:19.572 --> 00:22:23.175 region:rollup2
OF THINGS IN THERE WHERE I HAD

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:24.910 region:rollup2
REALLY YOU.

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:26.278 region:rollup2
TRY TO HARDEN THE SHELLS OF SOME

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.547 region:rollup2
OF THE SHELLFISH THAT'S ONE OF

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:29.081 region:rollup2
THE THINGS YOU DO. BUT THERE

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:31.884 region:rollup2
WERE.

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:33.252 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT ACTIONS AND THEN

00:22:31.884 --> 00:22:34.954 region:rollup2
WE WENT TO THE OCEAN PROTECTION

00:22:33.252 --> 00:22:37.389 region:rollup2
COUNCIL.

00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:38.791 region:rollup2
ANNA APPROPRIATED SOME REMAINING

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:41.927 region:rollup2
BOND TO HOLLERS FOR ABOUT THREE

00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:42.861 region:rollup2
POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:45.831 region:rollup2
PART OF.

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:47.800 region:rollup2
SORT OF WORK TO DO SOME OF ARE

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:49.535 region:rollup2
PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.770 region:rollup2
THE STUDY AND THE ACTIONS.

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:54.173 region:rollup2
AND.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.774 region:rollup2
THAT LEGISLATURE ALSO PASSED

00:22:54.173 --> 00:22:57.810 region:rollup2
TWO BILLS

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:59.545 region:rollup2
OUR THANKS TO A TO A STRONG

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.746 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SUPPORT.

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:02.815 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:04.783 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:06.719 region:rollup2
TO DO THE ADVISORY TEAM AND

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:08.354 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:10.289 region:rollup2
MANDATED BY THOSE BILLS.

00:23:08.354 --> 00:23:13.125 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE OVERVIEW I THINK THE

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:15.327 region:rollup2
THING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:17.296 region:rollup2
IS THAT AS THE ADMINISTRATION IN

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:20.032 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:22.134 region:rollup2
HAS MOVED THROUGH CAP AND TRADE.

00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:23.836 region:rollup2
ROOM CAP AND TRADE IN MANY WAYS.

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:25.738 region:rollup2
AND HAS NOT INTERSECTED WITH THE

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:28.908 region:rollup2
OCEAN.

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:30.909 region:rollup2
OF BECAUSE THERE REALLY INTO IT

00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:32.845 region:rollup2
TO TWO REALLY JUSTIFY IT IN THE

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:35.514 region:rollup2
FIRST ITERATION OF CAP AND TRADE

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:36.148 region:rollup2
MEET THE TIGHTEST OF LEGAL TESS.

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:38.050 region:rollup2
YOU HAD TO HAVE DEMONSTRATED

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:39.752 region:rollup2
SCIENCE.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.553 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWED THAT YOU WERE

00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:43.756 region:rollup2
CAPTURING CARBON YOU COULD

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:45.891 region:rollup2
QUANTIFY AVOID PROVE IT.

00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:48.894 region:rollup2
AND IN MANY WHY SOME OF THE

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:50.796 region:rollup2
STUDIES THAT WE HAVE AHA

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:52.698 region:rollup2
EMBARKED ON. WITH THE OCEAN

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:54.600 region:rollup2
PROTECTION COUNCIL MONEY.

00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:56.502 region:rollup2
IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AND HAVE

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.637 region:rollup2
THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS THAT IF IN

00:23:56.502 --> 00:24:00.372 region:rollup2
FUTURE ROUNDS WE THINK THAT

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:02.608 region:rollup2
THERE IS CARBON CAPTURE TO BE

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:04.677 region:rollup2
MADE BY THE VERY SUBJECT OF THIS

00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:05.544 region:rollup2
HEARING. THAN WE HAVE LAID THE

00:24:04.677 --> 00:24:07.446 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC BASIS

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:10.316 region:rollup2
TO DO IT.

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:12.484 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE CHALLENGES AND.

00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:14.186 region:rollup2
THE CHAIRMAN AS A MEMBER OF THE

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:16.422 region:rollup2
OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND HE

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:18.290 region:rollup2
HEARD ME GIFT THIS LITTLE RIFF

00:24:16.422 --> 00:24:21.060 region:rollup2
AT THE MEETING LAST WEEK.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.962 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES IS THE PERFECT

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.664 region:rollup2
WORLD OF SCIENCE

00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:27.132 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS INTERSECT

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:29.468 region:rollup2
WITH GOVERNMENT JOB LINES OF

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:32.271 region:rollup2
POLITICAL REALITIES.

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:35.507 region:rollup2
AND SO YES WE WANT IT PEER

00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:37.142 region:rollup2
REVIEW AND YES WE WANT BELLS AND

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:38.844 region:rollup2
WHISTLES TO PROVE IT EXACTLY.

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:41.146 region:rollup2
BUT THE OCEANS DETERIORATING

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:43.148 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIONS ARE CHANGING.

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:44.717 region:rollup2
HOW WE HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.352 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY TO DO IT AND WE

00:24:44.717 --> 00:24:48.020 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE

00:24:46.352 --> 00:24:49.355 region:rollup2
TO INTERSECT THE TO IN ITS AYE

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.856 region:rollup2
PLENTIFULLY SAID AT THE MEETING

00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:53.559 region:rollup2
THE OTHER DAY WE WOULD LIKE IT

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:55.227 region:rollup2
TO THE SCIENCE DONE SOMETIME IN

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:57.162 region:rollup2
THE COURSE OF OUR NATURAL LIFE?

00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:59.098 region:rollup2
AND AND SO BAD IT'S OUR

00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:01.100 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE INNER IT IS DOING THAT

00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:03.535 region:rollup2
AND. WE ALSO HAVE THE CHALLENGE

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.838 region:rollup2
YOU ALLUDED TO WHICH IS OUR

00:25:03.535 --> 00:25:07.639 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON ARE NOT GOING ON

00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:08.640 region:rollup2
AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:10.509 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.112 region:rollup2
AND SO. WITH THE RELATIONSHIPS

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:15.881 region:rollup2
WE BUILT.

00:25:13.112 --> 00:25:17.883 region:rollup2
WITH WASHINGTON AND OREGON.

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:19.051 region:rollup2
WE LAUNCHED THE INTERNATIONAL

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:20.652 region:rollup2
ALLIANCE TO FIGHT OCEAN

00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:22.855 region:rollup2
ACIDIFICATION.

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:24.623 region:rollup2
ALONG THE LINES.

00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:27.459 region:rollup2
OF THE PARIS CLIMATE COURTS

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:27.626 region:rollup2
WHERE WE GET INDIVIDUAL NATIONS.

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:29.895 region:rollup2
OR.

00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:31.663 region:rollup2
.

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:34.166 region:rollup2
SUB STATES TO COME IN AND MAKE

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:36.368 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL COMMITMENTS

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:38.070 region:rollup2
ON WHAT THEYWILL DO AND AGREED

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:40.539 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS ON THE

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.907 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION AND. THE EARLY

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:43.542 region:rollup2
INITIATORS ON IT WAS LAUNCHED BY

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:45.844 region:rollup2
OUR GOVERNOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:49.515 region:rollup2
OF WASHINGTON AND OREGON. ó WE

00:25:45.844 --> 00:25:51.283 region:rollup2
HAD FRANCE AND CHILE JOIN US. IT

00:25:49.515 --> 00:25:52.351 region:rollup2
CENTS BENT ICELAND THE AMORITES

00:25:51.283 --> 00:25:54.420 region:rollup2
FIJI'S AND I KEEP SAYING

00:25:52.351 --> 00:25:57.356 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES IN THE PACIFIC THAT

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.323 region:rollup2
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE. BUT

00:25:57.356 --> 00:25:59.725 region:rollup2
IT IS BROADENING.

00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:02.461 region:rollup2
AND IT IS TRYING TO TAKE THAT

00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:06.165 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:07.733 region:rollup2
WE DO IT. AND SO THERE ARE GREAT

00:26:06.165 --> 00:26:09.935 region:rollup2
THING ABOUT THIS HEARING.

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:11.036 region:rollup2
IS IT EDUCATES THE LEGISLATORS

00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:13.539 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THIS IS ONE

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:15.174 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY OVER TIME TO DO IT.

00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:16.809 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN HELP US WITH THAT

00:26:15.174 --> 00:26:18.710 region:rollup2
KIND OF PRESSURE.

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:21.046 region:rollup2
KEEP MOVING.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.481 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW I'M LOOKING AT

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:24.416 region:rollup2
THREE LEGISLATOR STEP WILL BE

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:27.553 region:rollup2
HERE. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:30.456 region:rollup2
AFTER I'M SECRETARY AND. THAT IS

00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:32.624 region:rollup2
DONE AND SO I AM HOPING FAT.

00:26:30.456 --> 00:26:35.627 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL PUSH

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:36.728 region:rollup2
WILL RESIDE ITSELF WITH YOU. AND

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:38.263 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE HAVE STARTED IT

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:40.132 region:rollup2
MIGHT THE GROUNDWORK FOR TO DEAL

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:42.000 region:rollup2
WITH CAP AND TRADE INTERNATIONAL

00:26:40.132 --> 00:26:43.469 region:rollup2
CONNECTIONS TO EDUCATION ON THE

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.471 region:rollup2
SCIENCE.

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:47.106 region:rollup2
AND MOVING EVERYBODY ALONG WILL

00:26:45.471 --> 00:26:48.607 region:rollup2
BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:50.342 region:rollup2
TAKE FORWARD AS WELL SO. THOSE

00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:52.311 region:rollup2
ARE THE OPENING COMMENTS I WANT

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:53.479 region:rollup2
TO MAKE A MINUTE TURN IT OVER TO

00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:54.880 region:rollup2
DEBRA HOW MUCH THAT IS THE

00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:56.548 region:rollup2

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:56.014 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THE MITIGATION

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:59.351 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

00:31:56.014 --> 00:32:01.953 region:rollup2
AND.

00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:04.790 region:rollup2
SO AS SCIENCE ON CARBON STORAGE

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:07.125 region:rollup2
BY EELGRASS ADVANCES STATE LED

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.927 region:rollup2
RESTORATION OF YOUR GRASS WILL

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:10.095 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO REALLY THINK THERE

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.963 region:rollup2
AND CONSIDER THE BENEFITTED

00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:14.466 region:rollup2
CARBON STORAGE AS ONE OF THE

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:16.735 region:rollup2
MANY CO BENEFITS HAVE. AND

00:32:14.466 --> 00:32:18.403 region:rollup2
RESTORATION AND MARY SMALL FROM

00:32:16.735 --> 00:32:19.805 region:rollup2
THE C. COASTAL CONSERVANCY WILL

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:22.340 region:rollup2
BE REPORTING ON SOME OF.

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:24.443 region:rollup2
AT THE ADVANCES ON THIS FRONT.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.011 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY NUMBER FOUR OF OUR

00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:27.913 region:rollup2
TASKS IS TO SUPPORT SCIENCE

00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:28.914 region:rollup2

00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:35.020 region:rollup2
REFLECT THE BEST

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:37.055 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE SCIENCE ON STRATEGIES

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.825 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:41.359 region:rollup2
HYPOXIA SO THIS IS WHERE OPC

00:32:39.825 --> 00:32:43.161 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS LIKE THE

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:45.197 region:rollup2
COASTAL CONSERVANCY AND LIKE THE

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:48.133 region:rollup2
OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST. LAKE OUR

00:32:45.197 --> 00:32:50.969 region:rollup2
OPC SAT AND WORK TOGETHER TO

00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:52.537 region:rollup2
STRENGTHEN OUR COLLABORATION AND

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:54.306 region:rollup2
AND REALLY DEVELOP AND SOME KEY

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:55.540 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROGRESS

00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:56.107 region:rollup2
THAT CAN COME OUT OF THE

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.911 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT'S HAPPENING.

00:32:56.107 --> 00:33:01.780 region:rollup2
AND.

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:03.348 region:rollup2
SO THESE PROJECTS AND SCIENTIFIC

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.984 region:rollup2
ADVANCES ARE REALLY CRUCIAL TO

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:08.019 region:rollup2
BETTER UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THE

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:09.754 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS OF THE LEGISLATION. BUT

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:12.090 region:rollup2
WITH AND WITHOUT.

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:13.458 region:rollup2
FUNDING FROM THE LEGISLATION WE

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.294 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE STEVE

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:18.563 region:rollup2

AS SECRETARY LAIRD MENTIONED

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:24.002 region:rollup2
JUST A MOMENT AGO. FUTURE

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:25.670 region:rollup2
FUNDING WILL REALLY BE CRITICAL

00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:26.404 region:rollup2
IN ADVANCING OUR WORK ON THIS

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.107 region:rollup2
TOPIC.

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:30.709 region:rollup2
AND.

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:32.043 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH ALL OF THE WORK THAT

00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:33.845 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING IN WITH OUR EMERGING

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:34.279 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THERE'S STILL A

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.947 region:rollup2
LOT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:38.149 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY.

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:39.684 region:rollup2
TIME ASSOCIATED WITH USING THESE

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:42.020 region:rollup2
HABITATS TO MITIGATE OCEAN

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:43.688 region:rollup2
ACIDIFICATION AND YOU'LL HEAR

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.857 region:rollup2
MORE ABOUT THAT FROM HER OUR

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:47.292 region:rollup2
SECOND PANEL. AND WE ARE REALLY

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:48.927 region:rollup2
WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:51.496 region:rollup2
BEST SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IS

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:53.131 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:55.600 region:rollup2
MAKE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.

00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:58.169 region:rollup2
WHILE BEING BOLD AND WHILE BEING

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.338 region:rollup2
VISIONARY AND SO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:02.774 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DO LEARN ABOUT HOW

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:04.943 region:rollup2
HABITATS CAN HELP AMELIORATE

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:06.478 region:rollup2
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION THAT WE WANT

00:34:04.943 --> 00:34:07.512 region:rollup2
TO FOLLOW THAT SCIENTIFIC

00:34:06.478 --> 00:34:09.314 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE WITH PILOT. I

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:10.615 region:rollup2
RESTORATION PROJECTS

00:34:09.314 --> 00:34:12.684 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN PARTNER WITH THE

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:14.386 region:rollup2
COASTAL CONSERVANCY ON AND BUILD

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:15.053 region:rollup2
ON OUR KNOWLEDGE WHILE REALLY

00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:15.921 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING ON THE GROUND

00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:17.956 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:18.790 region:rollup2
AND.

00:34:17.956 --> 00:34:19.925 region:rollup2
WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:22.627 region:rollup2
PROTECTING RESTORING THESE

00:34:19.925 --> 00:34:24.896 region:rollup2
HABITATS BOTH FOR THE ECOSYSTEM.

00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:27.699 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THEY PROVIDE AS WELL AS

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:30.168 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL FOR AND.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:32.404 region:rollup2
A CLIMATE CHANGE READINESS THAT

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:34.506 region:rollup2
THEY THAT THEY MAY PROVIDE AND

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:35.073 region:rollup2
AND WE WE ARE COMMITTED TO

00:34:34.506 --> 00:34:36.408 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO WORK ON THESE

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:38.843 region:rollup2
PROJECTS

00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:40.612 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANNEX I'D

00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:42.147 region:rollup2
LIKE TO ASK INTRODUCED MARRY

00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:43.114 region:rollup2
SMALL FROM THE STATE COASTAL

00:34:42.147 --> 00:34:45.317 region:rollup2
CONSERVANCY AND SHE CAN SPEAK

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:47.385 region:rollup2
MORE. ON THEIR EFFORTS AT THE

00:34:45.317 --> 00:34:48.153 region:rollup2
CONSERVANCY.

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:48.920 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU DEBORAH THANK YOU

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:51.790 region:rollup2
FOR HAVING ME.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.525 region:rollup2
AND.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.626 region:rollup2
AND AS AS EVER SAID I'M GONNA

00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:55.727 region:rollup2
SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

00:34:54.626 --> 00:34:57.629 region:rollup2
COASTAL CONSERVANCY'S ROLE IN

00:34:55.727 --> 00:34:59.764 region:rollup2
THIS WORLD AND PRIMARILY

00:34:57.629 --> 00:35:01.066 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING PILOT PROJECTS.

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:02.634 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT TIED TOGETHER.

00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:04.269 region:rollup2
.

00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:05.770 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTAL RESTORATION WITH

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:07.806 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND MONITORING. AND

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:09.874 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ADVANCE MULTI BENEFIT

00:35:07.806 --> 00:35:14.446 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IN THIS CONTEXT.

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:16.581 region:rollup2
DOES THIS WORK.

00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:18.316 region:rollup2
NOW. I GET. SO AND THIS IS A

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:19.718 region:rollup2
SCHEMATIC OF JUST SORT OF TRYING

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:21.319 region:rollup2
TO. BUILD IN A LITTLE BIT OF

00:35:19.718 --> 00:35:22.387 region:rollup2
CONTEXT

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:23.755 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF AN SEVENTY WERE

00:35:22.387 --> 00:35:25.924 region:rollup2
REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT

00:35:23.755 --> 00:35:27.692 region:rollup2
RESTORING MORE COMPLETE HABITAT

00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:29.194 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS SO I LIKE TO SAY WETLAND

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:31.096 region:rollup2
RESTORATION ISN'T JUST WETLANDS

00:35:29.194 --> 00:35:32.731 region:rollup2
ANYMORE. BUT IT'S LOOKING AT THE

00:35:31.096 --> 00:35:34.099 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONAL UPLAND IT'S LOOKING

00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:36.101 region:rollup2
AT THE TRANSITIONAL SUBTITLE

00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:37.702 region:rollup2
HABITAT AND RESTORING THESE MORE

00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:39.471 region:rollup2
COMPLETE SYSTEMS BECAUSE WE

00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:41.039 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:42.574 region:rollup2
ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS. THAT

00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:43.908 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IS

00:35:42.574 --> 00:35:45.477 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:48.079 region:rollup2
HAPPENS THERE'S GOING TO BE A.

00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:50.382 region:rollup2
NEED FOR THAT INTEGRITY ACROSS

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:51.383 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

00:35:50.382 --> 00:35:53.084 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT SUBTITLE

00:35:51.383 --> 00:35:55.120 region:rollup2
HABITATS

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:57.455 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A WHOLE HOST OF BENEFITS

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.157 region:rollup2
THE SORT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES

00:35:57.455 --> 00:36:01.092 region:rollup2
TO HUMANS THEY. PROVIDE.

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:02.727 region:rollup2
HOW IMPORTANT HABITAT FOR

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:05.330 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:07.532 region:rollup2
FISHERIES? THEY CAN HELP ACCRETE

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.768 region:rollup2
SEDIMENT AND REDUCE WAVE ENERGY

00:36:07.532 --> 00:36:12.070 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT OUR SHORELINES REDUCE

00:36:09.768 --> 00:36:13.938 region:rollup2
EROSION BY THE SYSTEMS CAN

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.607 region:rollup2
SEQUESTER CARBON. AND AS YOU'LL

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:19.010 region:rollup2
HEAR LATER THEY THEY CAN HELP

00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:22.147 region:rollup2
BUFFER FROM OCEAN ACIDIFICATION.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:24.215 region:rollup2
AND LET'S HARD TO READ BUT AND.

00:36:22.147 --> 00:36:26.418 region:rollup2
AS I SAID THE SYSTEMS DO

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:27.218 region:rollup2
SEQUESTER CARBON AND.

00:36:26.418 --> 00:36:29.421 region:rollup2
THE CAUSE OF CONSERVANCY WORKED

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:30.355 region:rollup2
WITH THE DELTA CONSERVANCY NDW

00:36:29.421 --> 00:36:32.757 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:36:30.355 --> 00:36:34.626 region:rollup2
ENDS WHEN ROCK AMERICAN CARBON

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:36.461 region:rollup2
REGISTRY TO DEVELOP A PROTOCOL

00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:38.396 region:rollup2
FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF

00:36:36.461 --> 00:36:40.065 region:rollup2
COASTAL AND FRESHWATER WETLANDS

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:41.866 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S IN THE

00:36:40.065 --> 00:36:43.001 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY CARBON.

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:45.603 region:rollup2
.

00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:48.273 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND THE RATES ARE REALLY

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:50.208 region:rollup2
REALLY HIGH. UP FOR EELGRASS AND

00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:52.143 region:rollup2
SEAGRASSES WE KNOW GLOBALLY THAT

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:53.678 region:rollup2
THOSE SYSTEMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:55.880 region:rollup2
IN THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO CARBON

00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:57.082 region:rollup2
SEQUESTRATION. BUT WE DON'T

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.617 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE ENOUGH DATA IN

00:36:57.082 --> 00:37:01.820 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO ASSESS HOW OUR

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:02.587 region:rollup2
SPECIES PERFORM YOU GUYS CAN

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.556 region:rollup2
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:05.557 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS TRUE THAT WE DON'T

00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:06.958 region:rollup2
REALLY KNOW IT UP. AND ONE OF

00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:08.626 region:rollup2
THE BIG GAPS AS WE ACTUALLY

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:10.795 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE GREAT MAPPING

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:12.497 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE OF EELGRASS ANNUAL

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:13.865 region:rollup2
GRASS POTENTIAL.

00:37:12.497 --> 00:37:16.367 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S A DATA

00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:17.535 region:rollup2
NEED.

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:19.204 region:rollup2
WE'LL TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THE

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:20.772 region:rollup2
PILOT PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:37:19.204 --> 00:37:22.607 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN YEAH. AND THIS IS A

00:37:20.772 --> 00:37:23.942 region:rollup2
PICTURE OF SOME HELP RESTORATION

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:25.744 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN SANTA

00:37:23.942 --> 00:37:28.346 region:rollup2
MONICA BAY THE BAY FOUNDATION

00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:29.514 region:rollup2
BEGAN. HELP RESTORATION TWENTY

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:31.583 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THE COASTAL

00:37:29.514 --> 00:37:32.650 region:rollup2
CONSERVANCY PROVIDED FUNDING IN

00:37:31.583 --> 00:37:34.519 region:rollup2
THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.653 region:rollup2
AND REALLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:38.223 region:rollup2
GOING INTO.

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:39.958 region:rollup2
URCHIN BARONS AND REDUCING THE

00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:41.526 region:rollup2
DENSITY OF THE URCHINS. I'M

00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:44.395 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY HAD WHERE THEY BECOME

00:37:41.526 --> 00:37:45.396 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY DANCE THAT HELP IT

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:46.664 region:rollup2
IT DECIMATES THE KELP FOREST AND

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:48.633 region:rollup2
THEY FIND THAT IF THEY REDUCE

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:51.002 region:rollup2
THE DENSITY IS. THAT THE KELP

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:52.303 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COMES BACK UP AND SOME

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:53.571 region:rollup2
OF THE SITES HAVE PERSISTED FOR

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.672 region:rollup2
A LONG TIME.

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:57.776 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A CURRENT GRANT WITH THE

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:59.677 region:rollup2
BAY FOUNDATION TO STUDY THAT.

00:37:57.776 --> 00:38:01.412 region:rollup2
A FACT OF THE KELP ON WAVE

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:02.347 region:rollup2
ATTENUATION AND TO THIS MEASURE

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:03.047 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANY

00:38:02.347 --> 00:38:04.549 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL BENEFIT TO THE

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:05.617 region:rollup2
SHORELINE.

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:07.719 region:rollup2
THAT DATA COLLECTION IS

00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:09.220 region:rollup2
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW SO WE ARE

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:11.956 region:rollup2
HOPING TO HAVE A REPORT OUT.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:13.758 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR.

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:15.126 region:rollup2
IN YEAH SAN FRANCISCO BAY WE'VE

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:16.161 region:rollup2
IN THE. BEEN INVOLVED IN A

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.962 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF SUBTITLE HABITAT

00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:19.230 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:20.465 region:rollup2
I WAS SUPPORT FROM THE OCEAN

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:22.167 region:rollup2
PROTECTION COUNCIL THE

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:24.035 region:rollup2
CONSERVANCY HELPED DEVELOP THE

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:26.304 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO SUBTITLE HABITAT

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:29.574 region:rollup2
GOALS REPORT. WHICH IS REALLY A

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:31.976 region:rollup2
LONG TERM FIFTY YEAR PLAN FOR

00:38:29.574 --> 00:38:33.611 region:rollup2
SUBTITLE HABITAT RESTORATION IN

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:35.647 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO BAY IT WAS REALLY

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:38.316 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME. LOOK AT THE

00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:40.385 region:rollup2
SUBTITLE OPPORTUNITIES AND WE

00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:41.486 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE A PC SUPPORT OF THAT.

00:38:40.385 --> 00:38:43.521 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:46.124 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED WAS THAT WE START TO

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:48.760 region:rollup2
DO PILOT RESTORATIONPROJECTS

00:38:46.124 --> 00:38:51.563 region:rollup2
WITH A REAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.231 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE BEEN DOING PATS

00:38:51.563 --> 00:38:56.000 region:rollup2
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH SEVEN

00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:56.534 region:rollup2
CISCO STATE AND KATHY PLAYERS

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.235 region:rollup2
LACK OF BEEN LEADING THAT

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:59.170 region:rollup2
SCIENCE.

00:38:57.235 --> 00:39:01.506 region:rollup2
DOING PILOT RESTORATION PROJECTS

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:03.408 region:rollup2
WHERE WE PLANT YOUR GRASS WE

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:05.310 region:rollup2
INSTALL THEM.

00:39:03.408 --> 00:39:07.412 region:rollup2
OYSTER SUBSTRATE AND NOW AND SEE

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.813 region:rollup2
IF THE OYSTERS WILL COME BACK.

00:39:07.412 --> 00:39:10.915 region:rollup2
I AND NUMBER MONITORING BOTH THE

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:12.317 region:rollup2
BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE AND THE

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:14.385 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF THOSE

00:39:12.317 --> 00:39:16.454 region:rollup2
PROJECTS CAN THEY ACTUALLY

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:18.923 region:rollup2
REDUCE WAVE ENERGY AT THE SHORE.

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:19.991 region:rollup2
DO WE SEE SETTLEMENT ACCRETION.

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:20.158 region:rollup2
DEAN OF THE NEXT SLIDE.

00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:21.492 region:rollup2
AND.

00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:23.962 region:rollup2
.

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:25.296 region:rollup2
THEY'RE INCREDIBLY PRODUCTIVE.

00:39:23.962 --> 00:39:27.432 region:rollup2
AMAZING RESPONSE FROM THE

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:30.201 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WE HAD TWO MILLION

00:39:27.432 --> 00:39:31.736 region:rollup2
OYSTERS WHAT IT WITH AN ESTIMATE

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:33.504 region:rollup2
BUT. THAT'S THE WAY THAT I IN

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:34.872 region:rollup2
THE FIRST YEAR AND WE'RE SEEING

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:36.307 region:rollup2
REALLY DRAMATIC.

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:38.977 region:rollup2
SURVIVAL OF THE L. GRASS.

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:40.879 region:rollup2
AND SOME.

00:39:38.977 --> 00:39:42.247 region:rollup2
SOME ENERGY DISSIPATION AND

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:44.415 region:rollup2
PRETTY AYE EXCITING LEVELS OF

00:39:42.247 --> 00:39:45.450 region:rollup2
SEDIMENTATION SO WE THINK IT CAN

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:48.586 region:rollup2
BE PART OF AN INTEGRATED

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:49.721 region:rollup2
STRATEGY. FOR HELPING AND.

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.655 region:rollup2
ADOPTED CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:52.724 region:rollup2
HELPING TO BRING BACK THE

00:39:50.655 --> 00:39:54.325 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:56.394 region:rollup2
I'M HERE TO THE NEXT SLIDE I

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:58.129 region:rollup2
WANNA PUT A LITTLE BIT OF A WORD

00:39:56.394 --> 00:40:00.698 region:rollup2
OF CAUTION IT'S HARD TO EVEN

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:02.967 region:rollup2
REMEMBER. THE LAST WINTER WAS

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:03.968 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE SWEATER.

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:05.970 region:rollup2
AND SAN FRANSISCO BAY THAT BIG

CHART SHOWS THE SALINITY IN SAN

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.674 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO BAY WHICH ACTUALLY

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:11.943 region:rollup2
TURNED INTO A FRESH WATER SYSTEM

00:40:09.674 --> 00:40:14.145 region:rollup2
FOR. A PRETTY PROLONGED PERIOD

00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:15.947 region:rollup2
OF TIME THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:18.850 region:rollup2
FRESH WATER COMING OUT.

00:40:15.947 --> 00:40:20.685 region:rollup2
AND THAT PRETTY MUCH DECIMATED

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:23.187 region:rollup2
OUR YELL GRASS AND OUR OYSTERS.

00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:25.323 region:rollup2
NOT ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED WE KNOW

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:28.459 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEMS FLUCTUATE WE KNOW

00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:30.528 region:rollup2
THE BAY FLUCTUATES. BUT I THINK

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:33.031 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:34.999 region:rollup2
HOW TO USE. THE SYSTEMS TO HELP.

00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:36.534 region:rollup2
.

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:37.802 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:39.637 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.705 region:rollup2
CHANGE TO REALIZE THAT THEY'RE

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:43.508 region:rollup2
ALSO GOING TO BE AT THE FRONT

00:40:40.705 --> 00:40:44.676 region:rollup2
LINES OF TAKING THE HITS.

00:40:43.508 --> 00:40:46.244 region:rollup2
OF CRIME VARIABILITY AND KIND

00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:48.413 region:rollup2
IMPACTS.

00:40:46.244 --> 00:40:49.948 region:rollup2
AND IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT TO

00:40:48.413 --> 00:40:51.916 region:rollup2
HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE DID

00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:52.483 region:rollup2
WAS TERENCE'S CHO STATE WHERE

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:53.618 region:rollup2
THEY WERE MONITORING IN REAL

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:55.620 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:56.888 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM SO WE KNEW THAT WE

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.323 region:rollup2
HAD THE BOSS OF THE OYSTERS AND

00:40:56.888 --> 00:40:59.857 region:rollup2
YELL GRASS.

00:40:58.323 --> 00:41:01.893 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE'RE MONITORING THE

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:03.294 region:rollup2
RECOVERY OF THE SYSTEMS

00:41:01.893 --> 00:41:04.529 region:rollup2
I'M AND I SHOULD SAY IT WASN'T

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:06.698 region:rollup2
JUST A RESTORED SITES BUT ILL

00:41:04.529 --> 00:41:07.999 region:rollup2
GRASS AND MANY PARTS OF THE BAY

00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:10.568 region:rollup2
THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR DECADES.

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:13.037 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY THIS EVENT.

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:14.339 region:rollup2
AND AND WE'RE WORKING WITH SANTA

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:16.607 region:rollup2
TO ALSO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:18.042 region:rollup2
GONNA GO BACK CAN BE PLANT SO.

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:19.711 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY OTHER POINT IS THAT I

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:20.878 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:41:19.711 --> 00:41:22.447 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:24.282 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THAT

00:41:22.447 --> 00:41:25.049 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T RESTORATION

00:41:24.282 --> 00:41:26.451 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY LIKE YOU BUILD AT

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:27.385 region:rollup2
ONCE AND.

00:41:26.451 --> 00:41:29.454 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

00:41:27.385 --> 00:41:31.289 region:rollup2
BUT WE MAY NEED TO ACTUALLY

00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:32.890 region:rollup2
COME BACK AND REPLANT SOME OF

00:41:31.289 --> 00:41:33.591 region:rollup2
THE SITES WE MAY NEED TO MAKE

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.626 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE BALANCE.

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:36.894 region:rollup2
AND.

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:38.563 region:rollup2
THAT WE HELP PRESERVE THE

00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:40.498 region:rollup2
BALANCE AND AND PRESERVE THESE

00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:41.866 region:rollup2
ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS. INTO THE

00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:43.501 region:rollup2
NOT SLIDE THIS IS JUST ANOTHER

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:45.436 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WHICH YOU VERY WELL MAY

00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:48.239 region:rollup2
HAVE HEARD ABOUT BUT. IN THE

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:51.042 region:rollup2
NORTH COAST AND THAT ABOVE HOT

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:53.778 region:rollup2
WATER BLOB IN THE OCEAN THE SEAS

00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:55.980 region:rollup2
ARE WASTING DISEASE HAS LED TO.

00:41:53.778 --> 00:41:58.383 region:rollup2
I'M CREATION OF VIRGIN BARREN

00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:00.218 region:rollup2
SPENT A REALLY DRAMATIC LOSS OF

00:41:58.383 --> 00:42:01.753 region:rollup2
THE CAL.

00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:03.187 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN.

00:42:01.753 --> 00:42:04.322 region:rollup2
THAT'S SORT OF THE IMPACTS OF

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:06.357 region:rollup2
THESE CLIMATIC VARIABILITY

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:09.026 region:rollup2
PLAYING OUT ON THE SYSTEMS.

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:10.495 region:rollup2
BY I THINK THE HOPEFUL PART OF

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.929 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN GET THE LAST SLIDE.

00:42:10.495 --> 00:42:13.564 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE'RE SEEING THESE

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:15.967 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS OF

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:18.569 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES RESEARCHERS

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:21.839 region:rollup2
FISHERMEN.

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:23.241 region:rollup2
HAPPY HAPPY RESEARCHERS. PLAYING

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:25.109 region:rollup2
IN THE MUD AND BY COMING

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:27.612 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND AND TRYING TO

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:29.380 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW HOW WE CAN HELP

00:42:27.612 --> 00:42:34.152 region:rollup2
RESTORE THE SYSTEMS AND. AND

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:34.719 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD.

00:42:34.152 --> 00:42:37.488 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW I'M SORRY AS MOST

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:40.224 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED.

THE GREEN AND YELLOW. THANK YOU.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.497 region:rollup2
MY NAME AND FOR CONTEXT TO THIS

00:42:44.529 --> 00:42:47.298 region:rollup2
IS BAD SORT OF TOP DOWN IF YOU

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.399 region:rollup2
WILL.

ACIDIFICATION ARE AWAY IS

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:07.111 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE ACIDITY OF THESE

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:08.646 region:rollup2
WATERS AND THE US WEST COAST IS

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:10.381 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES WHERE WE

00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:12.650 region:rollup2
EXPECT TO SEE. BIOLOGICAL

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.086 region:rollup2
SO.

00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:16.254 region:rollup2
ECHOING THE REMARK THAT WE ARE

00:44:15.086 --> 00:44:18.689 region:rollup2
ON THE FRONT LINES HERE.

00:44:16.254 --> 00:44:20.258 region:rollup2
NICK SITE PLEASE.

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:22.894 region:rollup2
OUR GROUP WAS CHARGED WITH.

00:44:20.258 --> 00:44:24.795 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT HOW RESTORATION

00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:26.764 region:rollup2
PROTECTION AND CULTIVATION OF

COASTAL AN EXTREME SUBMERGED

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:28.966 region:rollup2
AQUATIC VEGETATION YOU'LL SEE

00:44:27.365 --> 00:44:31.169 region:rollup2
IT.

00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:33.037 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IN THE PRESENTATION

00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:34.171 region:rollup2
ABBREVIATED AS SAB AT THAT

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:35.873 region:rollup2
REFERS THAT HELP IN THE SEA

00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:37.275 region:rollup2
GRASSES ON HOW HOW THIS

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:39.210 region:rollup2
VEGETATION UNDERWATER MAY

00:44:37.275 --> 00:44:41.445 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE. TO CALIFORNIA'S

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:42.680 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:44.515 region:rollup2
MITIGATION STRATEGIES.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.351 region:rollup2
THAT WAS OUR QUESTION.

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:48.653 region:rollup2
OF COURSE I LIKE ALL PLANTS.

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:50.955 region:rollup2
THE SUBMERGED AQUATIC

00:44:48.653 --> 00:44:51.789 region:rollup2
VEGETATION PHOTOSYNTHESIZE IS.

00:44:50.955 --> 00:44:53.824 region:rollup2
TAKES.

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:54.926 region:rollup2
THE ENERGY FROM LIGHT TAKES

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:57.528 region:rollup2
CARBON DIOXIDE THAT'S IN THE

00:44:54.926 --> 00:44:59.597 region:rollup2
WATER CONVERTS IT INTO PLANT BY

00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:02.099 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS IT RELEASES OXYGEN IN

00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:03.768 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS REQUIRES LIGHT. AND

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:05.169 region:rollup2
AS YOU CAN SEE UNDER CERTAIN

00:45:03.768 --> 00:45:06.103 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS AND THOSE FRANZ RIGHT

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:08.005 region:rollup2
THERE THOSE THOSE BLADES OF

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:09.207 region:rollup2
GRASS THAT BUBBLES ON THEM FROM

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.274 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCTION OF OXYGEN SYSTEM

00:45:09.207 --> 00:45:12.209 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T OFTEN GET TO SEE AN

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:14.245 region:rollup2
AIR BUT IT'S. AN INTERESTING

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:16.080 region:rollup2
PHENOMENON TO VISUALIZE THERE SO

00:45:14.245 --> 00:45:17.415 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT SUBMERGED AQUATIC

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.649 region:rollup2
VEGETATION HOUSE TO DO WITH

00:45:17.415 --> 00:45:20.651 region:rollup2
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IT'S THE

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:22.486 region:rollup2
CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR PROCESS

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:24.388 region:rollup2
AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS ON THE WAY

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:25.189 region:rollup2
THAT THEY REMOVE IT AND

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:26.791 region:rollup2
TRANSFORM IT INTO BIOMASS.

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:28.092 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE TWO WAYS IN WHICH

00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:30.294 region:rollup2
SEAGRASS AND HELP MAY BE

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:30.761 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL TO CLIMATE CHINA

00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:32.063 region:rollup2
CHANGE ADAPTATION AND

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:34.098 region:rollup2
MITIGATION.

00:45:32.063 --> 00:45:36.133 region:rollup2
THROUGH AMELIORATION AND THEIR

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:37.168 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO INCREASE PH IN THE

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:38.603 region:rollup2
WATER THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:40.338 region:rollup2
PHOTOSYNTHESIS.

00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:43.240 region:rollup2
ON AND THEIR POTENTIAL TO

00:45:40.338 --> 00:45:44.575 region:rollup2
SEQUESTER OR STORE CARTMAN SO

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.377 region:rollup2
CALLED BLUE CARBON.

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:48.512 region:rollup2
THROUGH A VARIETY OF WAYS NEXT

00:45:46.377 --> 00:45:50.982 region:rollup2
SLIDE.

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:52.149 region:rollup2
THE AMELIORATION PIECE

00:45:50.982 --> 00:45:54.218 region:rollup2
IS THE PART THAT YOU WILL

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:56.587 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HEAR MOST ABOUT TODAY.

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:58.256 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE WAYS IN WHICH

00:45:56.587 --> 00:46:00.091 region:rollup2
ACTIVE PHOTOSYNTHESIS CAN

00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:02.059 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY INCREASE THE PH A

00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:05.062 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE EXPOSURE ARE TOO

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:06.497 region:rollup2
ACIDIC WATERS BY ORGANISMS ARE

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:08.265 region:rollup2
BETTER LIVING WITHIN THE

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:09.667 region:rollup2
SEAGRASS BETTER THE KELP FORESTS

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:10.735 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHICH SYSTEM WE'RE

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:13.137 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

00:46:10.735 --> 00:46:13.971 region:rollup2
AND POTENTIAL.

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:16.140 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:17.074 region:rollup2
ORGANISMS NEARBY POTENTIALLY TO

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.243 region:rollup2
BENEFIT AS WELL.

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:21.278 region:rollup2
SO I.

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.946 region:rollup2
THE SEQUESTRATION PIECE REFERS

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:24.915 region:rollup2
TO.

00:46:21.946 --> 00:46:25.283 region:rollup2
LONGER TERM PROCESS SEES WHERE

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.418 region:rollup2
AND.

00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:29.820 region:rollup2
THE C. GROUSE AND THE KELP MAY

00:46:27.418 --> 00:46:31.856 region:rollup2
SERVE AS A NATURAL CARBON SINK

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.457 region:rollup2
STORING CARBON POTENTIALLY FOR

00:46:31.856 --> 00:46:35.326 region:rollup2
DECADES TO MILLENNIA AND THESE

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:37.628 region:rollup2
ARE THROUGH PROPHECIES OF BURIAL

00:46:35.326 --> 00:46:38.462 region:rollup2
AND TRANSPORT. WITHIN THE KELP

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:40.631 region:rollup2
FOREST.

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:42.366 region:rollup2
THE MAIN MECHANISM BY WHICH

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:44.168 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:45.469 region:rollup2
TO SEQUESTRATION IS BY TRANSPORT

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:48.039 region:rollup2
OF THE CALPERS ACTUALLY INTO

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:48.606 region:rollup2
VERY DEEP SEA HABITATS AND GETS

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:49.774 region:rollup2
SORT OF STUCK THERE ARE FEW

00:46:48.606 --> 00:46:50.875 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:52.610 region:rollup2
FOR LONG TERM.

00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:54.645 region:rollup2
FOR THE.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:56.914 region:rollup2
SEAGRASS BEDS THERE ARE COUPLE

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:58.816 region:rollup2
OF MECHANISMS BUT PRIMARILY IT'S

00:46:56.914 --> 00:47:00.518 region:rollup2
BURIAL OF BIOMASS FROM THE SEA

00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:01.686 region:rollup2
GRASS THEMSELVES POSSIBLY FROM

00:47:00.518 --> 00:47:03.554 region:rollup2
PARTICULATE MATTER THE WAY THAT

00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:05.022 region:rollup2
IT FILTERS DOWN INTO THE BEDS

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:06.057 region:rollup2
AND BURIAL IN THE SETTLEMENTS

00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:06.490 region:rollup2
UNDERNEATH THE ROOTS AND AND

00:47:06.057 --> 00:47:08.292 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.492 region:rollup2
THE SUBSTRATE BY THE SEA GRASS

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.795 region:rollup2
ITSELF

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:12.229 region:rollup2
NEXT.

00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:13.931 region:rollup2
SO THE KEY STATES US ARE THE KEY

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:15.032 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE IS

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:17.068 region:rollup2
WORKING TO ADDRESS.

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:18.369 region:rollup2
ARE ARE THESE DO USE THE

00:47:17.068 --> 00:47:19.570 region:rollup2
SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION

00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:21.539 region:rollup2
HABITATS.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:24.408 region:rollup2
MEASURABLY LESSEN THE SEVERITY

00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:27.044 region:rollup2
OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION EXPOSURE.

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:29.046 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY DO WHEN AND WHERE

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:30.514 region:rollup2
AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:32.216 region:rollup2
I DID THESE HABITATS BEST

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:33.317 region:rollup2
PERFORM THIS FUNCTION OF

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:35.086 region:rollup2
AMELIORATING.

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:37.121 region:rollup2
THE ACIDITY OF THE WATER.

00:47:35.086 --> 00:47:38.923 region:rollup2
AND CAN THE SUBMERGED AQUATIC

00:47:37.121 --> 00:47:41.158 region:rollup2
VEGETATION HABITATS BE MANAGED

00:47:38.923 --> 00:47:42.660 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY REDUCES

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:44.061 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENTAL STRAUSS OF

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.196 region:rollup2
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ON THE

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:48.032 region:rollup2
SPECIES THAT WE HAVE ALONG THE

00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:50.634 region:rollup2
WEST COAST.

00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:51.936 region:rollup2
TOWARD THAT END THE OCEAN

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:53.704 region:rollup2
PROTECTION COUNCIL SCIENCE

00:47:51.936 --> 00:47:54.372 region:rollup2
ADVISORY TEAM CONVENED A WORKING

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:56.307 region:rollup2
GROUP.

00:47:54.372 --> 00:47:58.642 region:rollup2
AND WORKING WITH OCEAN SIGNED

00:47:56.307 --> 00:48:00.544 region:rollup2
TRUST ON BEHALF OF A PC AND

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:01.545 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MANAGERS.

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:02.947 region:rollup2
WE WERE CHARGED WITH

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:04.014 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATING.

00:48:02.947 --> 00:48:06.050 region:rollup2
THE EMERGING SCIENTIFIC

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:07.585 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING SUMMARIZING

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.552 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES

00:48:07.585 --> 00:48:09.954 region:rollup2
FOR FILLING THEM THROUGH

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:11.522 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND MONITORING AND TO

00:48:09.954 --> 00:48:13.457 region:rollup2
PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON NEXT STEPS

00:48:11.522 --> 00:48:15.092 region:rollup2
SO OF THIS WAS THAT WORKING

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:16.794 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT GOT CONVENIENT.

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:18.529 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

00:48:16.794 --> 00:48:20.097 region:rollup2
THE DIVERSITY OF EXPERTISE THAT

00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:21.232 region:rollup2
WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON IT.

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:23.401 region:rollup2
THERE WERE TEN RESEARCH

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:25.136 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS THREE OF THEM ARE

00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:27.104 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION

00:48:25.136 --> 00:48:28.672 region:rollup2
COUNCIL SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:30.641 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES THERE WERE SEVEN

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:32.276 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES. ARE REPRESENTED

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:34.311 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SEVEN FOLKS FROM

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:36.614 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES EXCUSE ME FROM THE

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:38.382 region:rollup2
CSU THE UC SYSTEM IN OREGON

00:48:36.614 --> 00:48:40.518 region:rollup2
STATE UNIVERSITY ONE OF THE

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:41.919 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS WAS FROM A RESEARCH

00:48:40.518 --> 00:48:43.854 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE THE. MONTEREY BAY

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.822 region:rollup2
AQUARIUM RESEARCH INSTITUTE ONE

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:47.491 region:rollup2
WAS A CALIFORNIA SEA GRANT

00:48:44.822 --> 00:48:48.726 region:rollup2
EXTENSIONS SPELL SPECIALIST.

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:50.728 region:rollup2
THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY THREE

00:48:48.726 --> 00:48:51.996 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC STOP FROM THE OCEAN

00:48:50.728 --> 00:48:53.731 region:rollup2
SCIENCE TRUST

00:48:51.996 --> 00:48:55.933 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN BE IN A WORKSHOP.

00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:58.736 region:rollup2
WHICH INCLUDED ADDITIONAL.

00:48:55.933 --> 00:49:01.806 region:rollup2
OF FOLKS TO MAKE THE SCIENCE

00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:03.707 region:rollup2
REAL A FEW WELL CONNECTED TO FOR

00:49:01.806 --> 00:49:04.675 region:rollup2
POLICYMAKERS MANAGERS FROM

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.676 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND AT THE FEDERAL

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:08.712 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:10.448 region:rollup2
OPC STAFF OF IS TO STAFF BUT TO

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:12.183 region:rollup2
FOLKS FROM NGOS AM I WON

00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:12.817 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC EXPERT WHO

00:49:12.183 --> 00:49:14.251 region:rollup2
WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE WORKING

00:49:12.817 --> 00:49:15.986 region:rollup2
GROUP.

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:17.555 region:rollup2
THE FINDINGS ARE NOW AVAILABLE

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:19.623 region:rollup2
THAT CAME OUT THEY WERE RELEASED

00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:21.091 region:rollup2
JANUARY THIRTIETH SO YOU CAN.

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.992 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO THE DETAILS THERE.

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:23.661 region:rollup2
NICE.

00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:26.463 region:rollup2
BOOKLET AND.

00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:27.832 region:rollup2
WITHOUT I'M GOING TO.

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:29.233 region:rollup2
I THINK THE NEXT SLIDE IS YOU

00:49:27.832 --> 00:49:30.935 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA PASS ON TO MY

00:49:29.233 --> 00:49:31.802 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE AND CO CHAIR OF THAT

00:49:30.935 --> 00:49:35.005 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP.

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:36.207 region:rollup2
J. STOCKTWITS FROM UC DAVIS.

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:38.175 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU KARINA AND

00:49:36.207 --> 00:49:38.676 region:rollup2
THANKS CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:39.510 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS

00:49:38.676 --> 00:49:41.011 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:42.580 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO START

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.714 region:rollup2
WITH IS JUST HERE ARE SOME OF

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.815 region:rollup2
THE.

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:45.883 region:rollup2
ORGANISMS THAT YOU'VE BEEN

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.651 region:rollup2
HEARING ABOUT HERE THE PLANTS

00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:49.486 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DOING THE WORK.

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.721 region:rollup2
MOSTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:52.256 region:rollup2
YOUR GRASS WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:53.991 region:rollup2
ZOSTER MARINA AT STATEWIDE

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:55.459 region:rollup2
OCCURS FROM FROM BORDER TO

00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:57.261 region:rollup2
BORDER. THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:59.263 region:rollup2
SPECIES CALLED ZOSTER PACIFICA

00:49:57.261 --> 00:50:00.297 region:rollup2
WHICH LOOKS VERY SIMILAR AND

00:49:59.263 --> 00:50:01.966 region:rollup2
IT'S A BIT BIGGER BUT YOU'LL

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:04.535 region:rollup2
FIND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:50:01.966 --> 00:50:05.536 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HELP THERE'S

00:50:04.535 --> 00:50:07.238 region:rollup2
MOSTLY TWO SPECIES THAT WE'RE

00:50:05.536 --> 00:50:08.906 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY WE'RE

00:50:07.238 --> 00:50:09.840 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE GIANT KELP.

00:50:08.906 --> 00:50:11.342 region:rollup2
WHICH IS PUBLIC THE ONE

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.077 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S MOST FAMILIAR WITH

00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:14.211 region:rollup2
THAT'S MOSTLY IN THEIR CENTRAL

00:50:13.077 --> 00:50:15.813 region:rollup2
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THEN

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:16.947 region:rollup2
THE BULL KELP.

00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:18.716 region:rollup2
WHICH IS MOSTLY CENTRAL TO

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:21.118 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THOSE ARE

00:50:18.716 --> 00:50:21.886 region:rollup2
MOST OR TALK ONLY SAKE HELP.

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:23.187 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE

00:50:21.886 --> 00:50:24.555 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT AND WHEN WE TALK

00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:25.489 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOUR GRASS ITS BIT USUALLY

00:50:24.555 --> 00:50:28.859 region:rollup2
ZOSTER MARINA BUT IT MAY BE

00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:30.461 region:rollup2
EITHER OF THOSE.

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:31.862 region:rollup2
OKAY SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE SORT

00:50:30.461 --> 00:50:32.396 region:rollup2
OF HERE FOR RIGHT.

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.597 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THESE AT THE KEY

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:36.534 region:rollup2
FINDINGS

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:38.302 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST ONE IS A YES OKAY

00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:40.037 region:rollup2
WE CAN SAY THAT YES.

00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:42.072 region:rollup2
SERVERS AQUATIC VEGETATION CAN

00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:43.140 region:rollup2
LOCALLY INCREASE THE WATER PH BY

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:44.675 region:rollup2
THE MECHANISMS THAT KARINA WAS

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.510 region:rollup2
ALLUDING TO.

00:50:44.675 --> 00:50:47.144 region:rollup2
THEY TAKE UP CARBON DIOXIDE AND

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.579 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE P. H. AS A RESULT OF

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:49.880 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:52.616 region:rollup2
COURSE THE BIG QUESTIONS IS

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:54.118 region:rollup2
WHERE HOW MUCH AND AND AND AND

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:55.819 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE

00:50:54.118 --> 00:50:57.621 region:rollup2
ULTIMATE EFFECT OF THAT WE KNOW

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:59.823 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THE LONGER THE WATER

00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:00.791 region:rollup2
STAYS IN THAT. SEAGRASS BETTER

00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:02.459 region:rollup2
KELP FOREST THE GREATER THE

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:03.761 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.962 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE GREATER THE

00:51:03.761 --> 00:51:06.397 region:rollup2
PHOTO SYNTHETIC RATE THE GREATER

00:51:04.962 --> 00:51:07.665 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT.

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:09.500 region:rollup2
BUT CUT PIECING ALL THOSE

00:51:07.665 --> 00:51:10.868 region:rollup2
TOGETHER INTO EXACTLY A PICTURE

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.936 region:rollup2
OF WHERE AND WHEN THE AFFECTS

00:51:10.868 --> 00:51:12.970 region:rollup2
OUR GREATEST IS WHERE WERE

00:51:11.936 --> 00:51:15.940 region:rollup2
WORKING ON RIGHT NOW.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:17.575 region:rollup2
GOOD NEXT SIDE.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.877 region:rollup2
SO HOW BIG IS THAT AFFECT THAT'S

00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:21.612 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'D ALL LIKE TO KNOW. AND.

00:51:19.877 --> 00:51:23.380 region:rollup2
THE THE FIRST MESSAGE TO SORT

00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:24.481 region:rollup2
OF GET ACROSS FROM THIS IS THAT

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.283 region:rollup2
OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:26.517 region:rollup2
ANY SCIENTIST TELLS YOU WELL IT

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:28.018 region:rollup2
DEPENDS.

00:51:26.517 --> 00:51:29.453 region:rollup2
IT VARIES.

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:30.387 region:rollup2
AND AND IT DOES BUT I'M GONNA

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:32.189 region:rollup2
TRY TO TELL YOU LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:51:30.387 --> 00:51:33.757 region:rollup2
WHAT IT DEPENDS ON AND OF COURSE

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:35.159 region:rollup2
IF YOU KNOW THAT. FROM WHAT

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:36.627 region:rollup2
KARINA TOLD YOU THAT FOR THE

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:37.461 region:rollup2
SYNTHESIS DEPENDS ON LIKE YOU

00:51:36.627 --> 00:51:38.929 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S GONNA VERY TO THE

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:39.997 region:rollup2
COURSE OF THE DAY RIGHT DURING

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:41.765 region:rollup2
THE DAY WHEN THE PLANTS ARE

00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:44.268 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY GROWING IN TAKING UP

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:47.104 region:rollup2
CARBON DIOXIDE. THE P. H. WILL

00:51:44.268 --> 00:51:49.239 region:rollup2
GO UP AS THE CO TWO IS USED AT

00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:51.742 region:rollup2
NIGHT WHEN THE PLANT STOP VOTER

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:52.876 region:rollup2
SYNTHESIZING AND THEY'RE

00:51:51.742 --> 00:51:53.978 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY RESPIRE IN MORE POOR OR

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:55.913 region:rollup2
PUTTING OUT CARBON DIOXIDE THE

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:57.514 region:rollup2
P. H. MAY GO DOWN SO YOU CAN SEE

00:51:55.913 --> 00:51:59.116 region:rollup2
THERE. ON THIS.

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:00.751 region:rollup2
ON ON THIS GRAPH I HOPE THIS

00:51:59.116 --> 00:52:01.585 region:rollup2
WILL REACH APPEAR NOT BUT YOU

00:52:00.751 --> 00:52:03.854 region:rollup2
CAN SEE THAT THE.

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:05.322 region:rollup2
THE THE VARIATION INSIDE A

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:07.157 region:rollup2
SEAGRASS BED MIGHT BE PART

00:52:05.322 --> 00:52:08.892 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO BE LARGER THEN THE

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:10.327 region:rollup2
VARIATION OUTSIDE SEACREST BUT

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:11.929 region:rollup2
NO THE WORDS. THE HIGHS ARE

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:13.497 region:rollup2
HIGHER IN THE LOW'S ARE LOWER

00:52:11.929 --> 00:52:14.531 region:rollup2
INSIDE THAT INSIDE THAT

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:16.166 region:rollup2
SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:17.468 region:rollup2
THAT GOT.

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:18.936 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THAT'S THOSE ARE

00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:20.304 region:rollup2
BASICALLY THAT YOU KNOW SHOWING

00:52:18.936 --> 00:52:21.639 region:rollup2
THAT GAP. AND.

00:52:20.304 --> 00:52:22.973 region:rollup2
DOCTORS HILL AND.

00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:24.174 region:rollup2
NICHOLS WILL BE TELLING YOU A

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:25.743 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THIS

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:26.810 region:rollup2
VARIATION LATER ON WHEN THEY

00:52:25.743 --> 00:52:30.948 region:rollup2
PRESENT THE RESULTS OF SOME OF

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:32.349 region:rollup2
THEIR OPC FUNDED FUNDED WORK.

00:52:30.948 --> 00:52:33.617 region:rollup2
NEXT THING THAT WE ARE OF COURSE

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:35.052 region:rollup2
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT AS WE DON'T

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:36.687 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO KNOW ABOUT. P. H.

00:52:35.052 --> 00:52:38.389 region:rollup2
FOR PIZZA SAKE BUT WHAT AFFECT

00:52:36.687 --> 00:52:39.890 region:rollup2
DOES IT ACTUALLY HAVE ON THE

00:52:38.389 --> 00:52:41.692 region:rollup2
PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT ARE

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.160 region:rollup2
LIVING IN SEAGRASSES WHAT'S THE

00:52:41.692 --> 00:52:44.595 region:rollup2
REAL BY OFFERING AFFECT NOT FROM

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.263 region:rollup2
A CHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE FROM A

00:52:44.595 --> 00:52:47.965 region:rollup2
BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE.

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:48.866 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE MOST OF WHAT WE

00:52:47.965 --> 00:52:51.135 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:52:48.866 --> 00:52:51.835 region:rollup2
IS.

00:52:51.135 --> 00:52:54.371 region:rollup2
HOW DOES SOMETHING LIKE AN

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:56.206 region:rollup2
OYSTER GROW MORE OR LESS WHEN WE

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:57.941 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE AVERAGE P. H.?

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:59.309 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO YOU CAN SEE THE AVERAGE

00:52:57.941 --> 00:53:00.778 region:rollup2
INSIDE THE BAD IS A LITTLE BIT

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:03.080 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE OUTSIDE

00:53:00.778 --> 00:53:04.648 region:rollup2
THE BED. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.517 region:rollup2
OKAY WE CAN TEST THAT'S MOSTLY

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:08.152 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR.

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:08.852 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IF WHAT REALLY MATTERS

00:53:08.152 --> 00:53:11.055 region:rollup2
IS THE HIGHS

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:12.222 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD.

00:53:11.055 --> 00:53:14.458 region:rollup2
RIGHT WHAT IF THAT GOT MORE MORE

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:15.426 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IF THE MAXIMUM IS WHAT

00:53:14.458 --> 00:53:18.295 region:rollup2
MATTERS RIGHT OR WHAT IF THE

00:53:15.426 --> 00:53:19.463 region:rollup2
MINIMUM IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS.

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.898 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THIS A

00:53:19.463 --> 00:53:22.366 region:rollup2
FEW YOU KNOW HAD ANY SORT OF

00:53:20.898 --> 00:53:24.535 region:rollup2
INCLINATION TO GROW PLANTS OR A

00:53:22.366 --> 00:53:26.336 region:rollup2
GARDEN WHAT USUALLY LIMITS

00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:27.905 region:rollup2
PLANTS GROWING PLANTS HERE

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:29.506 region:rollup2
LOCALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:53:27.905 --> 00:53:30.841 region:rollup2
IS OFTEN LOW TEMPERATURES IN THE

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:32.176 region:rollup2
WINTER RIGHT WE CAN'T GROW A LOT

00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:34.044 region:rollup2
OF TROPICAL THINGS HERE BECAUSE

00:53:32.176 --> 00:53:34.711 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T WITHSTAND FREEZING.

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:36.613 region:rollup2
AND YOU MIGHT THINK THAT'S SORT

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:38.482 region:rollup2
OF THE ANALOGOUS THING MIGHT GO

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:39.716 region:rollup2
ON IN OUR AND OUR GRASS BEDS IN

00:53:38.482 --> 00:53:41.485 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS IT MIGHT NOT BE THE

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:43.287 region:rollup2
AVERAGE CONDITION THAT MATTER SO

00:53:41.485 --> 00:53:44.588 region:rollup2
MUCH. BUT IT MIGHT BE DOES IT

00:53:43.287 --> 00:53:45.989 region:rollup2
REALLY YOU KNOW IF THESE OYSTERS

00:53:44.588 --> 00:53:47.124 region:rollup2
ARE ARE ARE LAYING DOWN SHALL

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:48.792 region:rollup2
DURING THE DAY THAN THAT HUGE

00:53:47.124 --> 00:53:50.127 region:rollup2
BENEFIT DURING THE DAY MIGHT BE

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:51.862 region:rollup2
A REALLY BIG DEAL.

00:53:50.127 --> 00:53:52.930 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO SO WE TO THINK NOT JUST

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:54.932 region:rollup2
ABOUT BUTTON THE MEAN CHANGES.

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:56.900 region:rollup2
BUT THE AVERAGE CHANGE.

00:53:54.932 --> 00:53:59.436 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THOSE DO BIOLOGICALLY.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.305 region:rollup2
BUT NEXT LIKE.

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:03.507 region:rollup2
SO I'M I KNOW ONE ECHO SOMETHING

00:54:01.305 --> 00:54:05.275 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MARY SAID EARLIER AND

00:54:03.507 --> 00:54:07.010 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT. THE THE GOOD NEWS

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:08.612 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT WE ALREADY NOW

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:09.680 region:rollup2
THAT SEAGRASSES IN CULTS DO A

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:11.548 region:rollup2
LOT OF GOOD THINGS FOR

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.417 region:rollup2
ECOSYSTEMS AND AND FOR HUMANS

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:15.619 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S PROVIDING HABITAT.

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:16.553 region:rollup2
FISHES FOR CRABS FOR LOBSTERS

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:18.021 region:rollup2
BOTH COMMERCIALLY AND

00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:19.756 region:rollup2
RECREATIONAL IMPORTANT FISHERIES

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:21.024 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR WHETHER

00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:22.359 region:rollup2
IT'S TRACKING DOWN THE SORT OF

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:23.894 region:rollup2
COASTAL EROSION PROTECTION

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:25.529 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT MARY TOLD THE SIR.

00:54:23.894 --> 00:54:27.064 region:rollup2
ARE GOING ON IT WE ALREADY KNOW

00:54:25.529 --> 00:54:28.265 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN SOME SEA GRASS BEDS

00:54:27.064 --> 00:54:30.267 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THERE ARE A BUNCH OF

00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:32.436 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THE SEA GRASSES AND

00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:34.171 region:rollup2
CELTS ALREADY DO. AND SO THEN

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:36.006 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS WHAT ELSE DID

00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:37.341 region:rollup2
THEY DO WHAT ADDITIONAL BENEFIT

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:38.909 region:rollup2
CAN WE GET IN TERMS OF AWAY

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:40.644 region:rollup2
WHILE DOING ALL THESE THINGS

00:54:38.909 --> 00:54:42.212 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALREADY KNOW OUR BIG

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:44.515 region:rollup2
POSITIVE I'M FROM THE SWORDS

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:45.415 region:rollup2
AQUATIC VEGETATION.

00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:47.551 region:rollup2
SO LET ME.

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:48.585 region:rollup2
TAKE A SECOND TO JUST INTRODUCE

00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:50.287 region:rollup2
OUR OUR NEXT GROUP JUST SO YOU

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:51.388 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW THEY'RE GONNA FIT INTO

00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:52.956 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TESSA

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:55.425 region:rollup2
HILL. ABDUCTOR TESSA HILL GONNA

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:56.426 region:rollup2
LEAD US OFF. AND AND SHE HAS

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:58.796 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING WORK.

00:54:56.426 --> 00:55:00.898 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE WITH THE O. P. C..

00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:03.433 region:rollup2
THAT ASKS THE QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:04.902 region:rollup2
WELL WHAT LOCATIONS FOR EELGRASS

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:05.869 region:rollup2
SHOWED THE MOST PROMISE.

00:55:04.902 --> 00:55:07.671 region:rollup2
ARE THERE SOME PLACES WHERE THE

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:09.540 region:rollup2
EFFECTS ARE GREATER OR LOWER.

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:11.341 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE WHAT WHAT

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.643 region:rollup2
DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT SO FAR.

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.877 region:rollup2
AND THEN SHE'LL BE FOLLOWED BY

00:55:12.643 --> 00:55:15.813 region:rollup2
SIR NEWKIRK FROM THE NATURE

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:16.580 region:rollup2
CONSERVANCY WHO WILL BE TALKING

00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:18.482 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:20.150 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT

00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:22.252 region:rollup2
HOW SEAGRASS MIGHT COMPETE WITH

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.754 region:rollup2
OTHER SORTS OF USES IN IN

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:25.956 region:rollup2
COASTAL SYSTEMS. LIKE

00:55:23.754 --> 00:55:27.524 region:rollup2
AQUACULTURE BUT IF SEAGRASSES

00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:30.027 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:31.395 region:rollup2
PH THERE MIGHT ALSO BE BENEFITS

00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:32.429 region:rollup2
TO AQUACULTURE OTHER SORTS OF

00:55:31.395 --> 00:55:33.764 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS AND SHE'S GONNA TALK

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:35.065 region:rollup2
ABOUT BALANCING THOSE THOSE

00:55:33.764 --> 00:55:36.600 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:37.701 region:rollup2
AND AND OUR OUR LAST SPEAKER

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.368 region:rollup2
WILL BE CARRY NICHOLS DOCTOR

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:39.836 region:rollup2
CHEMICALS AND CAL STATE

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:41.738 region:rollup2
NORTHRIDGE WHO WILL BE FOR

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:43.473 region:rollup2
SHIFTING THE FOCUS FROM EELGRASS

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:44.908 region:rollup2
TO THINKING ABOUT HELPS.

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:46.276 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW FROM FOR EXAMPLE

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:47.778 region:rollup2
WHAT MARY SHOWED US THAT HELPS

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:49.813 region:rollup2
ARE DECLINING THROUGHOUT. A

00:55:47.778 --> 00:55:52.082 region:rollup2
LARGE PART OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:52.883 region:rollup2
CARRIES WORK ON THE EFFECTS OF

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:55.219 region:rollup2
KELP ON.

00:55:52.883 --> 00:55:56.820 region:rollup2
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND AND P.

00:55:55.219 --> 00:55:58.055 region:rollup2
H. WILL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.157 region:rollup2
WHAT THE IMPACTS OF THAT MIGHT

00:55:58.055 --> 00:56:01.425 region:rollup2
BE IN TERMS OF OF AFTER SHELF

00:56:00.157 --> 00:56:02.626 region:rollup2
FORMING ORGANISMS.

00:56:01.425 --> 00:56:03.794 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL BE SEEING

00:56:02.626 --> 00:56:04.962 region:rollup2
IN THE SECOND PANEL AND I THINK

00:56:03.794 --> 00:56:06.563 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT THAT'S THAT'S IT

00:56:04.962 --> 00:56:07.764 region:rollup2
FROM OUR PANEL AND. WOULD BE

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:08.665 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:10.734 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE ANY

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:12.169 region:rollup2
OKAY GOOD THANK YOU YEAH I DO

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:15.072 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME AND I WANNA MAKE SURE

00:56:12.169 --> 00:56:18.175 region:rollup2
THAT. OTHER MEMBERS HERE.

00:56:15.072 --> 00:56:20.444 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:56:18.175 --> 00:56:21.211 region:rollup2
TO ASK AND I'M GLAD MAYOR WHEN

00:56:20.444 --> 00:56:23.680 region:rollup2
YOU TALK ABOUT THE INTERTIDAL

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:25.215 region:rollup2
AND THE. THE TITLE AREAS ONE OF

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.017 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN OUR

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:28.952 region:rollup2
PLANNING HOW WE DEAL WITH THINGS

00:56:27.017 --> 00:56:30.687 region:rollup2
IS WE TEND TO DO. LAND BASED

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:31.788 region:rollup2
PLANNING OCEAN PLANNING

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:34.591 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM EACH

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:36.193 region:rollup2
OTHER AND FROM THIS.

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:38.395 region:rollup2
SO FAR EVEN IN THIS DISCUSSION

00:56:36.193 --> 00:56:39.897 region:rollup2
IS VERY VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE

00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:40.797 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT WE HAVE TO BE A

00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:44.334 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT SMARTER ABOUT THOSE

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:45.736 region:rollup2
THINGS. AND THE.

00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:47.337 region:rollup2
THE FRESHWATER CHALLENGES THAT

00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:48.672 region:rollup2
YOU BROUGHT UP WITH THE THE

00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:50.607 region:rollup2
FLUSH OF FRESH WATER GOING INTO

00:56:48.672 --> 00:56:51.842 region:rollup2
THE SAME CISCO BANG. THOSE AS TO

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:53.076 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEMS ARE OUR NATURAL

00:56:51.842 --> 00:56:53.644 region:rollup2
BUFFERS

00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:55.912 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY OVER

00:56:53.644 --> 00:56:57.180 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:58.248 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY FOR THOSE BUFFERS TO

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.917 region:rollup2
REACT AND DO WHAT THEY NEED TO

00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:01.752 region:rollup2
DO THERE'D BEEN TIMES IN THE

00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:03.787 region:rollup2
PAST WHERE THERE PROBABLY WAS.

00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:05.889 region:rollup2
PLENTY VIA GRASSES AND CISCO BAY

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:06.823 region:rollup2
CLEARED OUT BECAUSE OF.

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:08.058 region:rollup2
LOTS OF RAIN EVENT IN THE

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:09.760 region:rollup2
WINTERTIME BUT THEN IT WAS ABLE

00:57:08.058 --> 00:57:10.794 region:rollup2
TO RECOVER.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.663 region:rollup2
SO FOR US THIS WHEN THE

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:14.231 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES RE ESTABLISHING SOME

00:57:12.663 --> 00:57:16.800 region:rollup2
OF THOSE NATURAL SYSTEMS

00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:19.236 region:rollup2
TO THE BEST WAY. THAT WE.

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.605 region:rollup2
THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN BUT MS HUBS

00:57:19.236 --> 00:57:23.607 region:rollup2
I TUCKED BUT YOU MENTIONED AND

00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:24.808 region:rollup2
SECTARIAN BLARED MENTION SO

00:57:23.607 --> 00:57:25.275 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY THIS INTERNATIONAL

00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:25.475 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP GROUP.

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.477 region:rollup2
WHICH

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:28.879 region:rollup2
HAS.

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:30.113 region:rollup2
QUITE AN INTERESTING GROUP OF

00:57:28.879 --> 00:57:31.815 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES WHO ARE PARTICIPATING

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:33.884 region:rollup2
IN ANY AND I JUST HAVE TO POINT

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:35.552 region:rollup2
OUT OF COURSE CALIFORNIA. IS

00:57:33.884 --> 00:57:36.787 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING. THAT THE UNITED

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:39.022 region:rollup2
STATES SEEMS TO BE REPRESENTING

00:57:36.787 --> 00:57:41.425 region:rollup2
BUT CALIFORNIA IS WE'RE STEPPING

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:43.327 region:rollup2
IN FOR THAT NATIONAL EVEN THOUGH

00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:45.529 region:rollup2
WE'RE SUB NATIONAL JURISDICTION.

00:57:43.327 --> 00:57:47.864 region:rollup2
WHAT'S WHAT EXPECTATIONS WHAT'S

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:49.199 region:rollup2
THE PLAN WITH A PROCESS FOR THAT

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:50.834 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP CEO

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:53.970 region:rollup2
AND THE INTERNATIONAL WORKING

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:56.073 region:rollup2
GROUP IS EN A COLLABORATION OF

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:59.943 region:rollup2
SUBNATIONAL GROUPS ACADEMIC

00:57:56.073 --> 00:58:01.244 region:rollup2
GROUPS NGOS. AND TRIBES.

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:04.348 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH AND WHAT WE'RE

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:05.549 region:rollup2
TRYING TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE

00:58:04.348 --> 00:58:07.417 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:09.753 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONALLY. AND THEN TAKE

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:12.522 region:rollup2
CONCRETE STEPS TO ADDRESS

00:58:09.753 --> 00:58:14.791 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM SO EACH JURISDICTION

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:15.826 region:rollup2
THAT JOINS THE ALLIANCE IS

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:18.028 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP AN ACTION

00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:19.896 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT LAYS OUT WHAT STEPS

00:58:18.028 --> 00:58:22.099 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE. AT THEIR

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:23.500 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DID TO DEAL

00:58:22.099 --> 00:58:25.769 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROBLEMS OF CALIFORNIA

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.570 region:rollup2
AND IS IN THE PROCESS NOW OF

00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:29.272 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING OUR ACTION PLAN WE

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:31.975 region:rollup2
JUST LAST WEEK FUNDED.

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:35.178 region:rollup2
O. S. T. TO HELP US DEVELOP THE

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:37.214 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION AND MATERIALS AND

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:38.482 region:rollup2
OUTREACH AND DEVELOP KIND OF THE

00:58:37.214 --> 00:58:39.516 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING

00:58:38.482 --> 00:58:42.085 region:rollup2
WERE WORKING WITH A GROUP OF

00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:43.754 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS. AND SOME OF THE SAME

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:45.122 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS WHO HELPED DEVELOP

00:58:43.754 --> 00:58:46.156 region:rollup2
THE AS.

00:58:45.122 --> 00:58:47.524 region:rollup2
THE SCIENCE PANEL AND THEN A

00:58:46.156 --> 00:58:48.058 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL SCIENTISTS

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:50.360 region:rollup2
WHO WERE ON BOARD TO HELP

00:58:48.058 --> 00:58:52.429 region:rollup2
ANSWER.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.097 region:rollup2
WHATEVER SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS

00:58:52.429 --> 00:58:56.400 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED WHATEVER KIND OF.

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:57.968 region:rollup2
APPROACH WE NEED TO DEVELOP IT

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:02.005 region:rollup2
TO HELP CALIFORNIA MOVE FORWARD

00:58:57.968 --> 00:59:03.206 region:rollup2
IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. AND.

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:04.708 region:rollup2
JEFF THANK YOU DAY AND AND THANK

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:06.143 region:rollup2
FOR THAT THAT THAT WAS.

00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:08.111 region:rollup2
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WAS

00:59:06.143 --> 00:59:09.713 region:rollup2
EXPLAINED BECAUSE NOT ONLY. ARE

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:12.416 region:rollup2
WE DOING THIS BECAUSE OF. SOME

00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:13.283 region:rollup2
OF THE LEGISLATION AND INTEREST

00:59:12.416 --> 00:59:15.185 region:rollup2
IN THE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:16.920 region:rollup2
HAS IN ADDRESSING THIS BUT ALSO

00:59:15.185 --> 00:59:18.388 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT OF. THESE

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.590 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL. AGREEMENTS

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:22.259 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:23.727 region:rollup2
COORDINATION THAT'S GOING ON SO

00:59:22.259 --> 00:59:24.261 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING AN ACTION PLAN OTHER

00:59:23.727 --> 00:59:24.728 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES ARE DOING ACTION

00:59:24.261 --> 00:59:26.997 region:rollup2
PLANS.

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:28.598 region:rollup2
AND.

00:59:26.997 --> 00:59:29.900 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WE'RE GONNA

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:32.569 region:rollup2
OF ASSAULT BY OURSELVES NOBODY'S

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:33.970 region:rollup2
GONNA HAFTA LOOK AT THAT. GLOBAL

00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:35.439 region:rollup2
IMPACT AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:37.107 region:rollup2
THE BENEFITS OF THE WEST COAST

00:59:35.439 --> 00:59:38.542 region:rollup2
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION PANEL IS

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:40.811 region:rollup2
THAT IT WAS THAT A COLLABORATION

00:59:38.542 --> 00:59:42.846 region:rollup2
AMONG CALIFORNIA WASHINGTON

00:59:40.811 --> 00:59:43.780 region:rollup2
OREGON AND BRITISH COLUMBIA. AND

00:59:42.846 --> 00:59:45.982 region:rollup2
THERE'S REAL STRENGTH THERE AND

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:47.784 region:rollup2
SHOWING AND THE IMPACTS TO THE

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:49.553 region:rollup2
ENTIRE WEST COAST AND THAT WHEN

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:51.488 region:rollup2
NONE OF US ARE NOT ALLOWED WE'RE

00:59:49.553 --> 00:59:53.523 region:rollup2
ALL GONNA NEED TO WORK TOGETHER

00:59:51.488 --> 00:59:54.858 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ON OUR SCIENCE PANEL. A

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:56.593 region:rollup2
SCIENTIST FROM OREGON STATE

00:59:54.858 --> 00:59:59.429 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY SO WE'RE REALLY

00:59:56.593 --> 01:00:00.764 region:rollup2
TRYING TO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE.

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.599 region:rollup2
THE BRASS OF THE PROBLEM IN THE

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:06.770 region:rollup2
SCALE OF THE PROBLEM BUT AT THE

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:08.538 region:rollup2
SAME TIME LOCALIZE OUR ACTIONS

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.340 region:rollup2
TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL.

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:11.508 region:rollup2
OKAY AND AND ONE ONE OF THE

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.909 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF BRINGING SCIENCE

01:00:11.508 --> 01:00:15.979 region:rollup2
INTO THE LEGISLATURE IS OF

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:16.913 region:rollup2
COURSE OUR DESIROUS TO OKAY

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:18.849 region:rollup2
WOULD WE DID WHAT WE HAD WAS ON

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:20.450 region:rollup2
PACIFIC LET'S GO. AND GET THE

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:21.918 region:rollup2
SCIENCE IS DEVELOPING WHICH I

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:24.921 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR FROM

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:26.156 region:rollup2
HERE AND I DON'T.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:27.991 region:rollup2
I HOPE YOU'RE THEIR APPROPRIATE

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:30.093 region:rollup2
FOLKS ASK OR THAT NECESSARILY

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:30.694 region:rollup2
THE NEXT PANEL BUT ONE OF THE

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.362 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I'VE LEARNED ALONG

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:34.297 region:rollup2
THE WAY.

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:35.298 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPING AN

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.300 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE ELKHORN SLOUGH

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:39.169 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.339 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SEA OTTERS.

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:44.741 region:rollup2
EEL GRASS AND HOW NECESSARY THEY

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:46.776 region:rollup2
THEY ARE FOR EACH OTHER.

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:47.577 region:rollup2
LEADS US TO.

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:49.479 region:rollup2
START TO LOOK AT BETTER THE

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:51.348 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.182 region:rollup2
AND ASSUMING THIS IS ALL A PART

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:53.683 region:rollup2
OF IT I THINK THERE WAS A BRIEF

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:56.786 region:rollup2
MENTION IN THERE ABOUT SOME OF

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:58.488 region:rollup2
THE SPECIES AND. AND OTHER.

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:59.990 region:rollup2
IMPACTS AND IN INFLUENCES ON

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:02.592 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:03.727 region:rollup2
PLAY REPLANT EELGRASS.

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:06.663 region:rollup2
IF WE DO THAT WITHOUT AN

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:07.597 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF ECOSYSTEMS IN

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.766 region:rollup2
THE DANCE IS EXCESSIVE INCLUDING

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:11.434 region:rollup2
OTHER SPECIES. THAT WE'RE JUST

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:13.537 region:rollup2
PLAN SAYING HAVE IT REMOVED

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:16.339 region:rollup2
PLANS A HAVING REMOVED OR NOT

01:01:13.537 --> 01:01:20.744 region:rollup2
GETTING ANYWHERE. ALIKE DUMPING

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:22.345 region:rollup2
SAND ON BEACHES.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:24.447 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:25.782 region:rollup2
AND AND SO THAT THAT I'M

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:28.184 region:rollup2
ASSUMING IS A CONTEXT FOR ALL OF

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:30.387 region:rollup2
HIS HOUSE HOW. ARE ALL OF THOSE

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:32.255 region:rollup2
STUDIES GOING INTERLACE IN ORDER

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:34.758 region:rollup2
FOR US TO UNDERSTAND. POLICIES

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:37.027 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD BE WORKING ON

01:01:34.758 --> 01:01:39.095 region:rollup2
HELPING TO PROVIDE AS WELL AS OF

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:40.030 region:rollup2
COURSE FUNDING I DID NOTE THAT

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:41.131 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DEFINITELY A BUDGET IN

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.198 region:rollup2
THERE AND. THAT'S SOMETHING

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:42.933 region:rollup2
WE'LL HAVE TO WORK OUT BETWEEN

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.734 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:45.835 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:47.837 region:rollup2
TAKE ALL THIS SERIOUSLY AND

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:48.305 region:rollup2
FUNDING AT AND SECRETARY LEAD

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:49.439 region:rollup2
WAS CORRECT.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:51.474 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:52.976 region:rollup2
THE.

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:54.044 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:56.346 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN VERY VERY NARROWLY

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:58.448 region:rollup2
CONSTRUED NOW I THINK WE CAN

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:59.616 region:rollup2
START TO SEE HOW THEY CAN

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:01.384 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THE ADAPTATION

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:03.386 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION. THESE KINDS OF

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:05.155 region:rollup2
PROJECTS AS OPPOSED JUST PURELY

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:06.890 region:rollup2
MITIGATION ALTHOUGH WHAT WE TALK

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:08.758 region:rollup2
ABOUT REALLY ENCOMPASSES.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.860 region:rollup2
BOTH SO THAT THAT BROADER

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:12.696 region:rollup2
CONTEXT SPECIES EVERYTHING THAT

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:14.931 region:rollup2
WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT HOW THESE

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:16.066 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS INTERACT YEAH BUT IT.

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:17.634 region:rollup2
I BE HAPPY TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.469 region:rollup2
.

01:02:17.634 --> 01:02:21.605 region:rollup2
WE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY COGNIZANT.

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:23.306 region:rollup2
IN IN SOME WAYS WHEN WE PRESENT

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:24.608 region:rollup2
THIS SNAPSHOT IF YOU WILL OF

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:25.942 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE FINDING AND WE'VE

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:28.211 region:rollup2
BEEN FOCUSING A BIT ON THE

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:29.879 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:31.948 region:rollup2
IT MORE THAN THE BIOLOGICAL. BUT

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:33.116 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:34.251 region:rollup2
ALL OF US GOING TO SOME VERY

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:35.251 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WHERE

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.087 region:rollup2
WHEN AND UNDER WHAT

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:38.622 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S ABOUT

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.756 region:rollup2
EMBEDDING ALL OUR OTHER

01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:41.224 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE SYSTEM

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.758 region:rollup2
WORKS AND YOU'RE RIGHT SOMETIMES

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:43.393 region:rollup2
A SPECIES THAT ARE IN THE

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.894 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:47.163 region:rollup2
CAN IMPACT THE EFFICACY.

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:48.898 region:rollup2
OF THESE RESPONSES

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:50.533 region:rollup2
SO YES I THINK WHAT YOU KNOW

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.267 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IS THAT THE

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.902 region:rollup2
SYNTHETIC.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:54.804 region:rollup2
SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS THAT WE

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:56.139 region:rollup2
HAVE RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAD ARE

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:57.774 region:rollup2
VERY COGNIZANT OF ALL THOSE

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:59.609 region:rollup2
OTHER PLAYERS.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.910 region:rollup2
IF THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT AND

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:03.046 region:rollup2
I AND I THINK WE'RE DOING

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:05.582 region:rollup2
SOMETHING RIGHT IF YOU'RE ASKING

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:06.816 region:rollup2
US THAT QUESTION.

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:07.651 region:rollup2
WELL ANYTHING AND I KNOW IN

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:08.885 region:rollup2
CONTEXT THAT THAT IS BEING

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:09.486 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED BUT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.787 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:12.622 region:rollup2
SURE THAT. WE'RE REMINDING

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:15.759 region:rollup2
OURSELVES OF THIS WOULD WHERE WE

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:17.427 region:rollup2
ARE. IN THE INVESTIGATION.

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:18.928 region:rollup2
HOW REALLY NICE AND A LOT OF

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:20.530 region:rollup2
THIS IS IN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:22.932 region:rollup2
AND?

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:25.368 region:rollup2
SO COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS NEED

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:27.837 region:rollup2
TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND WELL FRAME.

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:29.139 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE SCIENCE.

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:30.440 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR YOU KNOW

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:32.242 region:rollup2
THERE ARE POTENTIAL TIPPING

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.377 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT WE MAY BE COMING

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:35.779 region:rollup2
CLOSER TO SO. THIS JUST THAT IS

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:37.013 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS JUST PART OF

01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:38.148 region:rollup2
THE FRAMEWORK OF THINKING ABOUT

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:39.649 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW IT'S

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:42.252 region:rollup2
IMPACTING ECOSYSTEMS.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:43.987 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND A FAIR AMOUNT BUT

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:46.122 region:rollup2
THEN THERE IS STILL THIS GREAT

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:47.457 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY MAYBE JAY WITH I

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:48.792 region:rollup2
HAVE LIKE MAYBE JUST JUST HAVE

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:50.160 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO.

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.760 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW GO BACK TO TEAR YOUR

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.796 region:rollup2
QUESTION THEY'RE SORT OF LONG

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.297 region:rollup2
THEN I THINK.

01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:55.899 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT WITHOUT A BORING YOU

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:57.300 region:rollup2
WITH THE ARCANE NATURE OF IT TO

01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:59.235 region:rollup2
SORT OF GROUPS OF SCIENTISTS

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.070 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN YOUR GRASS.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.538 region:rollup2
THERE BEEN PLANT PEOPLE AND

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:03.640 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEEN ANIMAL PEOPLE

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:04.674 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO. AND ALL PEOPLE DON'T

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.109 region:rollup2
REALLY CARE ABOUT HOW THE PLANTS

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.943 region:rollup2
WORK AS LONG AS THEY'RE THERE

01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:08.778 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE PLACE FOR THE

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:09.412 region:rollup2
ANIMALS TO LIVE.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.914 region:rollup2
AND.

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:11.748 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW THE PLAN PEOPLE

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:13.316 region:rollup2
DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE

01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:15.418 region:rollup2
ANIMALS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE I JUST

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:17.120 region:rollup2
LIKE PLANTS RIGHT. SO BUT NOW

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:18.722 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AWAY IS

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.956 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOING IS IT'S BRINGING

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:21.691 region:rollup2
THOSE GROUPS TOGETHER.

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:23.226 region:rollup2
BECAUSE

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:25.095 region:rollup2
THERE THE CONNECTIONS ARE EVEN

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:27.697 region:rollup2
MORE OBVIOUS NOW THAN THEY'VE

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:28.998 region:rollup2
EVER BAD WHERE. NOT ONLY IS IT

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:30.500 region:rollup2
JUST THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:31.901 region:rollup2
THAT PLANT BUT IT'S HOW IT'S

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.502 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE CHEMISTRY OF THE

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:34.404 region:rollup2
WATER THAT AFFECTS THE ANIMALS

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:36.673 region:rollup2
THEIR. ABILITY TO LAY DOWN

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:38.708 region:rollup2
SHELVE THEIR BEHAVIOR AS.

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:40.610 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS AS IN SELECTING

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.211 region:rollup2
HABITATS IN THERE IT WHETHER

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:42.212 region:rollup2
THEY EVEN COME THERE TO BEGIN

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:43.847 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.482 region:rollup2
AND AND SO I GUESS I'M I'M SORT

01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:48.084 region:rollup2
OF HOPEFUL THAT SOME OF THE

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:49.886 region:rollup2
EFFORTS THAT BY THAT OP SEE IN

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:51.321 region:rollup2
BOTH THE OTHER AWAY HYPOXIA

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:53.123 region:rollup2
GROUP AND IN OUR ARE WORKING

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:54.491 region:rollup2
GROUP IT'S ARE DONE. IS TO BRING

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:55.325 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SOME SCIENTISTS WHO ARE

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:56.726 region:rollup2
REALLY INTERESTED IN SORT OF

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:59.229 region:rollup2
MESHING THOSE TWO PERSPECTIVES

01:04:56.726 --> 01:05:00.363 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. AND AND I GUESS WHAT

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.631 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.632 region:rollup2
MY PERSPECTIVE NOW IS THERE'S

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.967 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH NO WAY TO THINK

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.568 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER IN

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:07.437 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS THERE'S JUST.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:09.105 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT PLANT

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:10.507 region:rollup2
PHYSIOLOGY OF SEA GRASS THAT'S

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:11.274 region:rollup2
GREAT I MIGHT LOVE THAT BUT

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.308 region:rollup2
THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NO WAY TO

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:14.410 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THAT WITHOUT THE

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:16.713 region:rollup2
ANIMALS FOR LOTS OF REASONS.

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:18.481 region:rollup2
AND VICE VERSA SO SO I I REALLY

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:19.983 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT EVEN THE SCIENCE

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:21.217 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THINGS HAS THAT

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:22.919 region:rollup2
SEPARATION THAT YOU'RE SORT OF

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:24.654 region:rollup2
HINTING AT.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.922 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S COMING TOGETHER.

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:27.791 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF THIS AND I THINK

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:29.626 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:30.193 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE MORE OF THAT FROM.

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:31.361 region:rollup2
FROM THE SCIENCE WERE GOING

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:33.196 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:34.030 region:rollup2
IT AND A GOOD POINT IF WE'RE

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:35.832 region:rollup2
GONNA BE DOING POLICY WE WE'VE

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:37.333 region:rollup2
GOT.

01:05:35.832 --> 01:05:39.769 region:rollup2
TO BRING A LOT OF THAT TOGETHER

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:41.237 region:rollup2
JUST LOOKING AT YOUR GRAPHICS OF

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:43.339 region:rollup2
THE KELP FOREST COVER.

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:44.808 region:rollup2
MANY START.

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:47.377 region:rollup2
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BE RELYING

01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:49.279 region:rollup2
ON CAL EELGRASS IN ORDER TO HELP

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:51.514 region:rollup2
AMELIORATE THE FACTS OF.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:53.216 region:rollup2
THAT THE PH CHANGES IN THE OCEAN

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:55.652 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CUP

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:57.554 region:rollup2
FOREST AGGRESSIVE BETS THAN.

01:05:55.652 --> 01:05:59.289 region:rollup2
THIS IS NICE BUT NOT GOING TO

01:05:57.554 --> 01:06:01.324 region:rollup2
REALLY GET AS.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:02.425 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE AND AS WE STAND IN

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.793 region:rollup2
OTHER CONVERSATIONS AS WE TALK

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:05.762 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:07.630 region:rollup2
AQUACULTURE AND EVEN THEIR

01:06:05.762 --> 01:06:09.699 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.868 region:rollup2
YEARS TO TO LOOK AT ALGAE'S

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:13.470 region:rollup2
EDIBLE ALGAE'S IN THE OCEAN AS

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:15.071 region:rollup2
PARTY AQUACULTURE. LET ALONE

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.006 region:rollup2
SOME THE SHELLFISH WHICH ALSO

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:18.775 region:rollup2
FILTER THE WATER AND HAVE AND

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:21.477 region:rollup2
HAVE OTHER BENEFITS TO IT.

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:24.214 region:rollup2
BUT A A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:27.083 region:rollup2
COULD FACILITATE AND.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:29.319 region:rollup2
ENTIRE ECONOMIC INDUSTRY AROUND

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:32.355 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY DONE.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:34.624 region:rollup2
AQUACULTURE BUT ALSO RESTORING

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:35.992 region:rollup2
THAT THE BULK OF THE NATURAL.

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:37.994 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:39.662 region:rollup2
HELP THE ILL GRASS SAID AND THE

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.030 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THESE THESE ESTUARIES

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:43.867 region:rollup2
WORK BECAUSE THEY YES WHERE YOU

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:45.535 region:rollup2
ALSO ARE A PHYSICAL. BUFFER TO

01:06:43.867 --> 01:06:48.204 region:rollup2
THE CHANGES THE WATER FLOWS IN

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:48.771 region:rollup2
SEES RISING IN SOME OF THE OTHER

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:49.739 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE OUT

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.273 region:rollup2
THERE AND.

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.007 region:rollup2
WE'VE TAKEN THOSE SYSTEMS

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:54.878 region:rollup2
REGRET%

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:56.279 region:rollup2
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND.

01:06:54.878 --> 01:06:58.281 region:rollup2
AS WE HEAR. THAT ONE THING I

01:06:56.279 --> 01:07:00.683 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO ADD TO THIS

01:06:58.281 --> 01:07:02.919 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BECAUSE OPC ISRAELI

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:03.786 region:rollup2
AN ECOSYSTEM BASED ORGANIZATION

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:05.822 region:rollup2
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:07.123 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:08.892 region:rollup2
OCEAN ECOSYSTEM AND NOT JUST A

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:11.027 region:rollup2
SPECIES BY SPECIES KIND OF

01:07:08.892 --> 01:07:13.296 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND. I THINK

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:15.865 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT.

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:17.433 region:rollup2
FOR SB WILLING TO EXPERIMENT AND

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:19.202 region:rollup2
SEE BE BOLD AND TO THE

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:20.837 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE AND THAT MAY MEAN

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:23.206 region:rollup2
THAT WE FUND SOME PROJECTS THAT

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:24.874 region:rollup2
FAIL. AND AND THAT IS REALLY

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:27.143 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF SEA

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:29.078 region:rollup2
GRASS AND CAL BECAUSE WE JUST

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.413 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW. AND BUT.

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:31.247 region:rollup2
IF WE WANT TO DO IT SECRETARY

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.715 region:rollup2
LAIRD WAS SAYING AND MOVE THE

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:34.417 region:rollup2
SCIENCE FOR IT BEFORE THE END OF

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.952 region:rollup2
HIS NATURAL LIFE WE REMAIN NEEDS

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:37.887 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:07:35.952 --> 01:07:39.355 region:rollup2
TO TAKE SOME THINGS ON FASTER

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:41.224 region:rollup2
THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE FEEL

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:42.225 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE DOING AND SO I THINK

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.860 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.728 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF. SOME OF

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.196 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING REQUEST IS CAN WE DO

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.031 region:rollup2
A PILOT PROJECT HERE CAN LEAD TO

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:50.300 region:rollup2
A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.

01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:51.901 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO TEST

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:54.237 region:rollup2
THESE THEORIES TO THEN BE ABLE

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.738 region:rollup2
TO SCALE THEM UP.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:56.906 region:rollup2
AND I SAID THAT'S EXACTLY THE

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.207 region:rollup2
POINT I WAS GOING TO MAKE AND I

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.742 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:02.278 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:03.646 region:rollup2
WE BE MORE NIMBLE AND THAT WE

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:05.949 region:rollup2
TAKE MORE RISKS.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:07.450 region:rollup2
AND STE YOU KNOW AS

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:09.052 region:rollup2
JAY SAID WE WE KNOW THAT

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:11.821 region:rollup2
RESTORATION OF THESE HABITATS IS

01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:13.890 region:rollup2
IT IS A NO REGRET STRATEGY. BUT

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:15.758 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE ABLE TO DO IT IN A SORT

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:16.993 region:rollup2
OF EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT ARE ARE

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.593 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY

01:08:16.993 --> 01:08:19.529 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO'S STATE

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:21.564 region:rollup2
IS.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:23.299 region:rollup2
REALLY AT.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:25.234 region:rollup2
MORE THAN PARTNER IN IT ANOTHER

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:27.036 region:rollup2
CO DIRECTING THE SCIENCE PIECE

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:28.671 region:rollup2
OF THAT WERE ABLE TO BE

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.939 region:rollup2
COLLECTING A LOT OF INFORMATION

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.541 region:rollup2
AND LEARNING AND I THINK YOU

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.176 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT REYES RIGHT WE'RE

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:35.211 region:rollup2
GONNA HOUSE TO.

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:36.779 region:rollup2
BE WILLING TO FAIL BE WILLING TO

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:38.181 region:rollup2
DO MORE EXPERIMENTAL KINDS OF

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:40.049 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:42.085 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW.

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:43.553 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY CONFIDENT THAT THAT

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:45.321 region:rollup2
IF WE RESTORE THESE HABITATS

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:47.323 region:rollup2
EVEN FOR A LITTLE WHILE THERE'S

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:48.424 region:rollup2
SOME BENEFIT THERE. AND BUT IF

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:50.827 region:rollup2
IT ALSO ADVANCES OUR

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:52.495 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT'S THAT'S

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:54.230 region:rollup2
WORTHWHILE TO AND AS. AS WE SEE

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:56.899 region:rollup2
MORE CLIMATIC VARIABILITY WE

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:59.569 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE MORE NIMBLE AND IN

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:01.070 region:rollup2
HOW WE RESPOND.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:02.305 region:rollup2
IT AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:04.040 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD POINT OF COURSE WERE

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:06.776 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE AND NOTHING WE

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:09.078 region:rollup2
DO HERE EVER VANNATTER WE'RE NOT

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:11.114 region:rollup2
USED TO THAT. BUT.

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:12.815 region:rollup2
THE IT IN AND.

01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:14.484 region:rollup2
THIS IS KIND OF WHY I THINK I'M

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:17.920 region:rollup2
EXCITED BY THIS CONVERSATION AND

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:20.223 region:rollup2
SOME OF. THE ABILITY TO TO LOOK

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.090 region:rollup2
AHEAD BECAUSE IF THE SCIENCE IS

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:23.059 region:rollup2
THERE AND THE SCIENCES SAW.

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.926 region:rollup2
THEN

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:25.528 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE RESULT OF AN

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:27.563 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PROJECT.

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:29.065 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS IT FITS INTO A A

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:31.134 region:rollup2
LARGER.

01:09:29.065 --> 01:09:32.735 region:rollup2
PLAN AND PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:34.037 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO DO THEN BY

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:36.072 region:rollup2
DEFINITION IT'S REALLY NOT A

01:09:34.037 --> 01:09:37.607 region:rollup2
FAILURE. YET THE ALL THOSE

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:39.409 region:rollup2
PAINTINGS HAVE SCHOOL BAY CASE

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:40.877 region:rollup2
IN POINT YES THEY WERE PLANTING

01:09:39.409 --> 01:09:41.511 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE WHERE SOME OF THE U.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.945 region:rollup2
GRASS WAS WORKING.

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:44.781 region:rollup2
THEN

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:46.215 region:rollup2
A HUGE RAIN

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:48.317 region:rollup2
VERY VERY WET WINTER COMES

01:09:46.215 --> 01:09:50.153 region:rollup2
CHANGES THE SALINITY OF THE BAY

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:51.854 region:rollup2
CHANGES ALL OF THAT.

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:52.555 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING AND

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.890 region:rollup2
ONE OF THINGS WILL BE

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:55.224 region:rollup2
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THOSE

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:57.060 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ARE COVER WHETHER THEY

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:59.195 region:rollup2
NEED OUR ASSISTANCE OR WHETHER

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.530 region:rollup2
WE CAN PUT ENOUGH IN PLACE?

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.665 region:rollup2
BETTER WILL START TO WORK THE

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:04.500 region:rollup2
WAY IT WOULD HAVE WORKED.

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:06.135 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.969 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE HAD HARDENED THE BAY

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.871 region:rollup2
AND REALLY CHANGE THOUGH SYSTEMS

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.807 region:rollup2
IRREPARABLY.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:12.875 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE VALUE

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:13.476 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO SEE US.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:20.083 region:rollup2
DO LIKE MY COMMENT THE WORKING

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:22.085 region:rollup2
VERY WELL. MAY BE

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:23.319 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A GOOD THING TO

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:25.588 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BUT IF WE'RE RELYING

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:26.956 region:rollup2
ON A PROJECT TO BE THE FINAL

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:29.158 region:rollup2
SOLUTION FOR A MITIGATION.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:31.194 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LITTLE SCARY BUT IF WE

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:32.829 region:rollup2
HAVE A BROADER PLAN. THAT IS

01:10:31.194 --> 01:10:35.064 region:rollup2
SCIENCE BASED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:38.000 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE DOING THEN WE HAVE

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:39.869 region:rollup2
SOME ABILITY FOR SOME SUCCESS IN

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.571 region:rollup2
FOR SOME LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:45.742 region:rollup2
AS. AS WE MOVE THROUGH AND THAT

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:47.210 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A PART BE ABLE TO BE A

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:50.680 region:rollup2
PART OF THE OVERALL STRATEGY.

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:51.681 region:rollup2
I WOULD HOPE.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.181 region:rollup2
SO IT WOULD JUST ACCURATE REMARK

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:53.416 region:rollup2
ON THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:55.918 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:57.687 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONE OF MY A SCIENTISTS

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.954 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THAT PROJECT AND SHE

01:10:57.687 --> 01:11:00.623 region:rollup2
WAS VERY.

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:01.591 region:rollup2
.

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.158 region:rollup2
IT IS WAS CONCERNED AFTER THE

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:04.393 region:rollup2
RAINS AND THAT WE HAVE SEEN

01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:05.795 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:06.496 region:rollup2
FREE SPROUTING AND.

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:08.831 region:rollup2
NATURAL.

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:11.400 region:rollup2
GROWTH COMING OUT AND THAT'S

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:12.702 region:rollup2
VERY EXCITING THAT'S VERY IT

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.371 region:rollup2
DOES SEEM TO BE RECOVERING BUT

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:18.007 region:rollup2
WE'RE LEARNING WHERE IT RECOVERS

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:20.176 region:rollup2
BOUNCED WHICH PLACES MAY BE.

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:20.743 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL REFUGIO THAT WILL

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:23.913 region:rollup2
THEN SERVICE SOURCE MATERIAL

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:26.649 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:29.485 region:rollup2
RECOVERY IN OTHER PLACES SO I'D

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:30.686 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THAT SPATIAL MOSAIC AND

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:32.388 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE MONITORING THAT WE'RE

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:35.224 region:rollup2
DOING IS REALLY INFORMING US ON

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:36.692 region:rollup2
THE GROUND. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:39.929 region:rollup2
AFTER AN EVENT LIKE THAT WHICH

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:42.431 region:rollup2
PLACES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT?

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:44.901 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO HOW DO WE GO FROM

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:46.302 region:rollup2
THERE EVEN GIVEN THE INCREASED.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:48.004 region:rollup2
.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:50.907 region:rollup2
VARIABILITY AND BEING ON THE

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:51.541 region:rollup2
FRONT LINES.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.509 region:rollup2
AND THEN AT LEAST RIGHT BACK TO

01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:55.778 region:rollup2
THE.

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:57.980 region:rollup2
THE FANA DISCUSSION BECAUSE IN

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:59.148 region:rollup2
SOME THE ZEAL BAD EELGRASS BEDS

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.784 region:rollup2
THOUGH CRAP POPULATION CAN TAKE

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:02.585 region:rollup2
THE ALGAE OFF WHICH HARMS THEM

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:05.354 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THE ORDERS CAME IN

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:06.355 region:rollup2
OUR. EATING THE CRABS NOW ORDERS

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:09.292 region:rollup2
ARE FLOURISHING YOUR GRASS CAN

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:11.561 region:rollup2
FLOURISH THOSE CONNECTIONS HELP

01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:13.629 region:rollup2
WAS. LEAD TO THE RECOVERY AND

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:15.097 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ONE PIECE IN THERE IF WE

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:15.698 region:rollup2
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEN WE'LL

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:19.168 region:rollup2
BE SCRATCHING OUR HEADS ABOUT

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:19.802 region:rollup2
WHY IT'S NOT RECOVERING IN THE

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:23.506 region:rollup2
WAY WE THOUGHT HE WOULD EXPECT.

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:25.608 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:27.510 region:rollup2
THANK YOU BRING UP KANSEN THANK

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:28.945 region:rollup2
YOU DATA WILL WILL MOVE ON TO

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.946 region:rollup2
OUR NEXT PANEL.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:30.446 region:rollup2
SO FOR LOCAL PERSPECTIVES AND

01:12:29.946 --> 01:12:42.291 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS.

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:44.760 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:46.095 region:rollup2
AND THIS NEW CAR CLASS. I SAW

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.331 region:rollup2
YOU WE WERE PADDLING ON THE

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:50.833 region:rollup2
ELKHORN SLOUGH.

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:53.035 region:rollup2
THEN AROUND SOME OF THOSE ADDED

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:54.270 region:rollup2
VOTE HERE HE FIFTH.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.872 region:rollup2
YEAH WITH THE EEL GRASS BEDS IN

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:58.507 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:13:01.577 region:rollup2
AND THE ORDERS AND ALL.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:02.745 region:rollup2
OKAY LISA ACTUALLY BEGIN CAN NOT

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.980 region:rollup2
FIRST I JUST WANNA THANK YOU

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:05.181 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR YOUR

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:06.949 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND I

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:08.451 region:rollup2
REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:08.885 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE SWAT

01:13:08.451 --> 01:13:10.920 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:12.288 region:rollup2
.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.122 region:rollup2
I WAS THE OTHER THING THAT I

01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:15.024 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT TO SAY WHICH IS THAT

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:17.193 region:rollup2
CLEARLY A TAKE HOME MESSAGE FROM

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:19.762 region:rollup2
TODAY IS THAT. EFFORTS TOWARDS

01:13:17.193 --> 01:13:21.197 region:rollup2
RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION OF

01:13:19.762 --> 01:13:22.765 region:rollup2
SEAGRASSES ARE DEFINITELY ó A

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:23.833 region:rollup2
WIN WIN SITUATION AND THIS HAS

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:25.835 region:rollup2
BEEN RE ITERATED BY SEVERAL

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:26.235 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE ALREADY. SO I WILL

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:28.904 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:30.373 region:rollup2
ADD MY VOTE TO THAT STATEMENT

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:33.075 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:33.809 region:rollup2
REASONS TO RESTORE AND CONSERVE

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.311 region:rollup2
THESE HABITATS THAT WE'RE

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:37.713 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT. AND WHEN WE ADD

01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:39.448 region:rollup2
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION OR CARBON

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:42.551 region:rollup2
SEQUESTRATION ON TOP OF THEM

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:43.786 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST SORT OF AN EXTRA YOU

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:46.722 region:rollup2
KNOW BONUS REASON.

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:48.557 region:rollup2
WHAT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT?

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:49.859 region:rollup2
ARE SOME CURRENT PROJECTS THAT

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:51.794 region:rollup2
ARE SUPPORTED BY THE OCEAN

01:13:49.859 --> 01:13:53.029 region:rollup2
PROTECTION COUNCIL. THAT SPAN

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:55.331 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:57.033 region:rollup2
.

01:13:55.331 --> 01:13:59.101 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS IN LARGE PART

01:13:57.033 --> 01:14:00.636 region:rollup2
WERE INSPIRED BY INITIAL WORK

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:02.772 region:rollup2
THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.272 region:rollup2
SEAGRAM'S AND SO YOU'LL SORT OF

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:05.374 region:rollup2
HERO.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:07.476 region:rollup2
ME SAY THIS A COUPLE TIMES THAT

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:08.878 region:rollup2
THESE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATE

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:10.179 region:rollup2
AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:11.047 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY QUITE IMPORTANT IN

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:12.715 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING QUESTIONS LIKE

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:14.917 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:14:12.715 --> 01:14:16.585 region:rollup2
THE YELLOW DOTS ON THE MAP HERE

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:18.454 region:rollup2
TELL YOU PLACES THAT WORST

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:19.755 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:22.425 region:rollup2
THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:24.894 region:rollup2
SEAGRASS MEADOWS. CAN MODIFY

01:14:22.425 --> 01:14:26.228 region:rollup2
EXTREME CHEMISTRY AND ALSO STORE

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:29.165 region:rollup2
CARBON SO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:33.569 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BOTH ASPECTS OF WHAT

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:35.137 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS PANEL DISCO.

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:37.306 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO BASICALLY TAKE A

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:38.975 region:rollup2
DEEP DIVE INTO TWO OF THESE

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.409 region:rollup2
SITES AND SO THE FIRST ONE IS

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:42.445 region:rollup2
THE HUMBOLDT OCEAN CARBON

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:43.879 region:rollup2
OBSERVATORY. THIS IS LED BY JOE

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:45.948 region:rollup2
TUBERS  <u><c.green>OF CALIFORNIA SEA</c></u>

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:47.249 region:rollup2
GRANT ON IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:49.852 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS AT HUMBOLDT STATE

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:52.054 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY AND UC DAVIS I'M ONE

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:54.590 region:rollup2
OF THOSE COLLABORATORS.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:55.925 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT ENCOMPASSES THREE

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:58.561 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT GOALS ALL WITHIN

01:14:55.925 --> 01:15:00.196 region:rollup2
HUMBOLDT BAY AND SO THE FIRST RC

01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:01.897 region:rollup2
REST SURVEYS WERE SCIENTISTS ARE

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:03.466 region:rollup2
GOING OUT REPEATEDLY TRYING TO

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:05.601 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THE SEA GRASS. IS

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:07.837 region:rollup2
CHANGING SEASONALLY AND THROUGH

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:09.538 region:rollup2
TIME AND WERE GOING TO HEAR MORE

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:11.574 region:rollup2
FROM SARAH NEWKIRK NEXT ON SORT

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:12.775 region:rollup2
OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF HOW WE

01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:14.477 region:rollup2
MIGHT MONITOR SEAGRASSES LIKE

01:15:12.775 --> 01:15:16.278 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:18.914 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS PROJECT

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:20.583 region:rollup2
IS ON A SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE TO

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:21.717 region:rollup2
OUR MONITORING SYSTEM IN THIS IN

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.818 region:rollup2
THE CAT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:24.787 region:rollup2
REGION.

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:26.422 region:rollup2
UPGRADING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:28.491 region:rollup2
MONITORING BOTH THAT TRINIDAD

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:29.925 region:rollup2
PIER AND WOOD IN HUMBOLDT BAY IN

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:31.227 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH HOG ISLAND

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:33.129 region:rollup2
OYSTER COMPANY.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:35.664 region:rollup2
THIS IS BUILDING UPON A FIVE

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:37.199 region:rollup2
YEAR PARTNERSHIP THAT OUR GROUP

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:38.834 region:rollup2
AT UC DAVIS HAS HAD WITH HOG

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:41.003 region:rollup2
ISLAND OYSTER COMPANY. WE DO

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:42.671 region:rollup2
MONITORING JUST LIKE THIS MOLLIS

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:44.607 region:rollup2
BAY WHERE IT'S ESSENTIALLY SORT

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:46.642 region:rollup2
OF A WEATHER STATION IN THE

01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:48.577 region:rollup2
OCEAN WHERE WE ARE TRACKING THE

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:51.147 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:51.881 region:rollup2
INSIDE OF THAT DAY. THROUGH TIME

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:53.449 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE NOW.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:55.184 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SOCIAL PROTECTION

01:15:53.449 --> 01:15:57.420 region:rollup2
COUNCIL SUPPORT BEEN ABLE TO

01:15:55.184 --> 01:16:00.222 region:rollup2
EXPAND AND PLACE THOSE WEATHER

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.823 region:rollup2
STATIONS I'M ON THE HUMBOLDT

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.690 region:rollup2
COAST AND WITHIN THE HUMBOLDT

01:16:00.823 --> 01:16:03.926 region:rollup2
BAY.

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.860 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALSO THE STE SITES ARE

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:06.595 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED BY THE CENTRAL AND

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:08.130 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OCEAN

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:09.965 region:rollup2
OBSERVING SYSTEM SO AGAIN WE'RE

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:12.768 region:rollup2
SEEING SCIENCE THAT IS BEING

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:15.204 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED BY MULTIPLE DIFFERENT

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:17.573 region:rollup2
FEDERAL AND STATE PARTNERSHIPS.

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:20.176 region:rollup2
FINALLY THIS SITE INCLUDES

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:22.044 region:rollup2
MONITORING OF SEAGRASS CHEMISTRY

01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:23.446 region:rollup2
BOTH WIN IT WOULD IN A SEA GRASS

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:25.614 region:rollup2
MEADOW AS WELL AS OUTSIDE WITH

01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:27.783 region:rollup2
THE REST MEADOW. AND MONITORING

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:30.653 region:rollup2
OYSTER GROWTH SO GETTING AT THAT

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:33.189 region:rollup2
BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO CHANGE.

01:16:30.653 --> 01:16:35.491 region:rollup2
AND THAT PEACE IS BASICALLY

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:36.859 region:rollup2
NESTED WITHIN A MUCH BIGGER

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:38.260 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE EFFORT THAT WE HAVE

01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:40.296 region:rollup2
MADE.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.832 region:rollup2
SO WE TELL YOU ABOUT THAT.

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:43.499 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT HUMBOLDT PIECE IS

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:46.168 region:rollup2
PART OF.

01:16:43.499 --> 01:16:47.636 region:rollup2
I'VE A EFFORT THAT WE'VE MADE

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:49.371 region:rollup2
TO TRACK THESE PROCESSES WITHIN

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:51.040 region:rollup2
SIX DIFFERENT ACTUARIES ACROSS

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:52.608 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S ABOUT A DOT A DOZEN

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.043 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SEAGRASS MEADOWS ARE

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:56.445 region:rollup2
BEING STUDIED.

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:58.114 region:rollup2
IN EACH CASE WE PLAY SENSORS

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:59.949 region:rollup2
WITH IN THE SEAGRASS BAD AND

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:02.051 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE SEA GRASS BAD.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:03.853 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:05.754 region:rollup2
TIMES ALSO WITH OYSTERS.

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:06.856 region:rollup2
AND WERE BASICALLY TRACKING HOW

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:08.891 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS OF OCEAN

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:09.425 region:rollup2
ACIDIFICATION IS AMELIORATED OR

01:17:08.891 --> 01:17:12.228 region:rollup2
MODIFIED BY THE SEA GRASS

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:14.430 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:16.332 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING THIS BOTH IN.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:18.734 region:rollup2
NATURAL OR NATIVE SEAGRASS

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:20.102 region:rollup2
MEADOWS AS WELL AS SITES THAT

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:21.937 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TARGETS FOR

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:22.471 region:rollup2
RESTORATION SORE ALSO TRYING TO

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:25.007 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. WHICH OF THESE

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:27.776 region:rollup2
TYPES.

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:30.412 region:rollup2
RESTORED VERSES NATURAL MEADOWS

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:32.381 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE BETTER AT THIS PROCESS

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:33.315 region:rollup2
OR ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE COULD

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:35.718 region:rollup2
MAXIMIZE.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:37.486 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT FROM FROM THE

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:38.854 region:rollup2
SIMILARITY XIN.

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.688 region:rollup2
AGAIN I LIKE TO TAKE SORT OF A

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:41.991 region:rollup2
DEEP DIVE INTO ONE OF THESE

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:43.492 region:rollup2
SITES.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.528 region:rollup2
AND NOT IS CYPRESS GROVE INTO

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:46.529 region:rollup2
MOLLIS BANG.

01:17:45.528 --> 01:17:48.097 region:rollup2
THIS IS PROBABLY THE SITE WE

01:17:46.529 --> 01:17:49.498 region:rollup2
KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE BEST AT

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:51.033 region:rollup2
THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'VE

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.902 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY MONITORED IT OVER A

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:53.435 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS NOW.

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:55.137 region:rollup2
AND.

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:57.773 region:rollup2
A PHD STUDENT.

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:59.441 region:rollup2
MELISSA WARD HAS ALSO BUILT A

01:17:57.773 --> 01:18:01.744 region:rollup2
CO TWO FOX TOWER THAT ACTUALLY

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:03.479 region:rollup2
SITS ON SHORE. AND MEASURES THE

01:18:01.744 --> 01:18:05.981 region:rollup2
CARBON DIOXIDE THAT'S GOING FROM

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:07.316 region:rollup2
THE AIR IN TO THE SEA WATER

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.617 region:rollup2
RIGHT ABOVE THE SEA RESPITE.

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:10.419 region:rollup2
SO AT THIS PARTICULAR SITE WE'RE

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:12.588 region:rollup2
TRACKING THE FULL PROCESS WERE

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:14.890 region:rollup2
WATCHING THE CEO TO GO INTO THE

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:16.892 region:rollup2
SEA WATER. WERE WATCHING HOW

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:18.327 region:rollup2
THAT CO TWO THEN MOVES THROUGH

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:20.262 region:rollup2
AND IS MODIFIED WITHIN THE

01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:21.230 region:rollup2
SEAGRASS BED.

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:22.531 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE.

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:25.434 region:rollup2
SENSORS I TOLD YOU ABOUT AND

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:27.036 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO TAKING SEDIMENT CORES

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:30.339 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THE SETTLEMENTS.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:31.840 region:rollup2
BELOW THE SEA GRASS BEDS SO AS

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:33.175 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.110 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IN

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:36.579 region:rollup2
A FOREST WITH SOILS BELOW A

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:38.847 region:rollup2
FOREST THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:41.417 region:rollup2
CARBON. THAT ENDS UP STORED IN

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:42.885 region:rollup2
THOSE SOILS THE SAME THING

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:44.153 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IN A SEA GRASS BEDS AND

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:46.755 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT.

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:47.957 region:rollup2
OF CARBON ORGANIC MATTER THAT

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:49.692 region:rollup2
GETS TRAPPED THERE AND IS

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:50.859 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TRAPPED FOR DECADES TO

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:52.728 region:rollup2
CENTURIES AND WERE ACTUALLY

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:54.830 region:rollup2
TRYING TO QUANTIFY THAT PIECE AS

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.798 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.333 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE JUST GIVE YOU A SENSE

01:18:55.798 --> 01:19:00.002 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR FROM THIS

01:18:57.333 --> 01:19:01.470 region:rollup2
SITE IN PARTICULAR.

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:02.838 region:rollup2
DURING THE SUMMER SEAGRASS

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.940 region:rollup2
MEADOWS CAN CHANGE THE WATER

01:19:02.838 --> 01:19:06.809 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY UP TO ABOUT POINT ONE

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.143 region:rollup2
P. H. UNIT.

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:10.145 region:rollup2
WHAT I MEAN BY SUMMER IS

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:11.480 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THAT SEASON WHERE

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:14.216 region:rollup2
THE SEAGRASS MEADOWS ARE QUITE

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.085 region:rollup2
WASH FROM ABOUT MAY TO OCTOBER?

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:17.786 region:rollup2
TO MANY PEOPLE POINT ONE PITCH

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:19.121 region:rollup2
UNIT MIGHT SEEM SMALL.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:20.923 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SAME

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:22.591 region:rollup2
AMOUNT THAT OCEAN CHEMISTRY HAS

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:25.060 region:rollup2
CHANGED ALREADY DUE TO HUMAN

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:26.595 region:rollup2
IMPACTS TO THE ANTHROPOGENIC

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:29.365 region:rollup2
OCEANA CITIZENS URGED OSHA

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:30.499 region:rollup2
SUFFOCATION SIGNAL RIGHT NOW. IS

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:32.234 region:rollup2
ABOUT POINT ONE PH UNIT.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:33.135 region:rollup2
SO IT'S DEFINITELY A SIGNIFICANT

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.736 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAT THOSE SEA GRASSES

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:35.904 region:rollup2
ARE HAVING. DURING THE SUMMER

01:19:33.736 --> 01:19:37.172 region:rollup2
SO.

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:38.440 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE CASE DURING THE

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:40.743 region:rollup2
WINTER AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.778 region:rollup2
EXPLORE SORT OF WHAT THAT MEANS.

01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:44.580 region:rollup2
IN THE BIG PICTURE OVER AN

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:46.148 region:rollup2
ENTIRE YEAR WITH THAT MEANS.

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:48.017 region:rollup2
FOR THE NET IMPACT THE SEA

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:49.151 region:rollup2
GRASSES ARE HAVING.

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:50.486 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT WE SEE IS

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:52.187 region:rollup2
THAT SETTLEMENTS WITH IN THOSE

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:54.023 region:rollup2
SEA GRASS MEADOWS PARTICULARLY

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:56.659 region:rollup2
SMALLEST DAY HAVE UP TO ABOUT

01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:58.360 region:rollup2
TWO TIMES MORE ORGANIC CARBON.

01:19:56.659 --> 01:19:59.895 region:rollup2
THEN ON VEGETATED HABITATS

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.964 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE MORE BUT

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:03.399 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES THEY DO AND SO NOW

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:05.100 region:rollup2
THE NEXT STEP IS FOR US TO

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:06.835 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY. WHAT ARE THE

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.371 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE IT SO

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:11.573 region:rollup2
THAT SEE GRASS BEDS ACTUALLY CAN

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:13.208 region:rollup2
STORE THAT CARBON FOR DECADES TO

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:14.910 region:rollup2
CENTURIES ARE THERE PARTICULAR

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:16.545 region:rollup2
MEADOWS THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:18.280 region:rollup2
TARGET FOR RESTORATION OR

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:20.416 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION? THAT IF WE CAN

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:23.952 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THOSE CHARACTERISTICS

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:25.387 region:rollup2
THAT OPTIMIZE THIS PROCESS.

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:26.689 region:rollup2
AS I WRAP UP HERE I JUST WANT TO

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:28.524 region:rollup2
SORT OF REITERATE A COUPLE OF

01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:29.992 region:rollup2
THREE THING A COUPLE A COUPLE

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:31.627 region:rollup2
THINGS HERE A COUPLE OF THREE

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:33.395 region:rollup2
THINGS. AND.

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:35.264 region:rollup2
BUT ONE IS THAT WE'VE LEARNED A

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:38.133 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT THIS IN

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:39.168 region:rollup2
A VERY RAPID. UP.

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:41.003 region:rollup2
PACE A RAPID.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:42.104 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:44.473 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY WERE ON A PRETTY

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:46.809 region:rollup2
STEEP TRAJECTORY OF LEARNING

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:48.811 region:rollup2
ABOUT BOTH SEAGRASS AND HELP.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:50.479 region:rollup2
IS PLAYING A ROLE IN BOTH OCEAN

01:20:48.811 --> 01:20:52.448 region:rollup2
ACIDIFICATION AND TO CARBON

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:53.916 region:rollup2
SEQUESTRATION.

01:20:52.448 --> 01:20:55.517 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO CONTINUE ON THAT

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:57.186 region:rollup2
ABOUT STEEP TRAJECTORY WE NEED

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:58.354 region:rollup2
TO SORT OF CONTINUE TO ANSWER

01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:00.756 region:rollup2
THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS THAT WE'VE

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:01.190 region:rollup2
BEEN IDENTIFYING TODAY AND SO I

01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:03.525 region:rollup2
WILL JUST.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:05.227 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UNDERSCORE THAT IN THE

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:07.096 region:rollup2
STATE INVESTMENT

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:08.897 region:rollup2
IN THESE MONITORING AND RESEARCH

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:11.100 region:rollup2
EFFORTS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:12.301 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN THAT TRAJECTORY.

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.168 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:14.870 region:rollup2
SAY IS THAT.

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:16.605 region:rollup2
.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:18.307 region:rollup2
THIS EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:20.776 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS REALLY A STORY THAT HAS

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:22.010 region:rollup2
BEEN FACILITATED BY PARTNERSHIPS

01:21:20.776 --> 01:21:23.612 region:rollup2
AND I ACTUALLY WAS HAPPY THAT I

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:24.980 region:rollup2
HEARD AT LEAST TWO OF THE OTHER

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:26.548 region:rollup2
SPEAKERS. MENTIONED THE

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.349 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIPS

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:29.184 region:rollup2
INCLUDING YOU.

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:30.986 region:rollup2
.

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:31.587 region:rollup2
SO WHAT YOU HEARD WHAT I JUST

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:33.355 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED TO.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:34.823 region:rollup2
.

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:36.792 region:rollup2
REFLECTS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:39.294 region:rollup2
STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:40.396 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES CONSERVATION GROUPS

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:41.163 region:rollup2
AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THE

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:42.831 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE

01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:45.000 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:46.735 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD PROPOSE THAT

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.470 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THIS ARE A

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:50.906 region:rollup2
MODEL FOR HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.507 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE STATE.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:53.208 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY FEDERALLY IF WE

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:54.276 region:rollup2
CAN GET.

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:56.578 region:rollup2
THEIR THEIR EAR.

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:57.946 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:22:00.983 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:02.751 region:rollup2
SPEAKER.

01:22:00.983 --> 01:22:03.585 region:rollup2
THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STONE AND.

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.220 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:05.888 region:rollup2
WHO SHOULD BE WATCHING OR

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:08.590 region:rollup2
LISTENING.

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:10.626 region:rollup2
I'LL START MY REMARKS BY SAYING

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:12.161 region:rollup2
AYE TO SORT OF CABINETS ON THE

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:13.829 region:rollup2
ODD WOMAN OUT ON THIS PANEL FOR

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:16.064 region:rollup2
TWO REASONS ONE IS THAT I'M NOT

01:22:13.829 --> 01:22:16.932 region:rollup2
A SCIENTIST.

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:18.901 region:rollup2
I THE SECOND AND SO YOU'LL HAVE

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:21.170 region:rollup2
TO GIVE ALL YOUR HARD QUESTIONS

01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:21.637 region:rollup2
TO CARRY AND TESSA AYE AT THE

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:23.472 region:rollup2
END BUT.

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:25.007 region:rollup2
THE SECOND IS THAT MY PROJECT

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:27.543 region:rollup2
IS NOT AN OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

01:22:25.007 --> 01:22:28.577 region:rollup2
PROJECT AYE IT IS NEVER THE LESS

01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:30.679 region:rollup2
RELEVANT.

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:31.346 region:rollup2
WELL I'LL I'LL TELL YOU A

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:35.651 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:37.352 region:rollup2
I HAVE A VIDEO THAT WILL AYE.

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:39.788 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENT FOR OUT MY FAILURE TO

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:42.658 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:45.360 region:rollup2
THE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IS AS

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:47.663 region:rollup2
BAD NEWS FOR SHELLFISH AND.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.897 region:rollup2
THOUGH SHELLFISH INDUSTRY

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:50.432 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZES THAT AND IN

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:53.168 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE THE NATURE

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:55.637 region:rollup2
CONSERVANCY AND.

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:57.339 region:rollup2
OYSTER AQUACULTURE OPERATORS

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:59.241 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES ARE

01:22:57.339 --> 01:23:03.579 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING WHAT

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:04.713 region:rollup2
WE'RE CALLING THE. AYE.

01:23:03.579 --> 01:23:05.914 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY THE SHELLFISH CLIMATE

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:06.682 region:rollup2
COALITION WHICH WILL OPERATE AT

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.983 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND LOCAL STATE AND

01:23:06.682 --> 01:23:10.452 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEVEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:12.221 region:rollup2
POLICY. ON THE INDUSTRY IS IS IS

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:14.456 region:rollup2
WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF OUR

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:16.525 region:rollup2
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ON ITS

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:17.059 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE AND THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:18.527 region:rollup2
IS THAT MEANS THAT OCEAN

01:23:17.059 --> 01:23:19.661 region:rollup2
ACIDIFICATION IS ALSO BAD NEWS

01:23:18.527 --> 01:23:20.662 region:rollup2
FOR SHELLFISH CONSUMERS.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.730 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THAT OYSTERS ARE

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:22.464 region:rollup2
DELICIOUS AND WE WANT TO.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.031 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO PRODUCE THEM IN

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.199 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:25.601 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS IN FACT THE THIRD

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:27.336 region:rollup2
LARGEST SHELLFISH CONSUMING

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:28.370 region:rollup2
STATE IN THE UNITED STATES UP

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:30.873 region:rollup2
BUT IN STATE SHELLFISH

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:32.140 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION MEETS LESS THAN HALF

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:32.941 region:rollup2
OF THAT DEMAND.

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.810 region:rollup2
OUR STATE SHELLFISH INDUSTRY

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:36.778 region:rollup2
COULD BE SUPPLYING A SUBSTANTIAL

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:38.714 region:rollup2
UNSUSTAINABLE LOCAL. I. N.

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:40.182 region:rollup2
EXPORT MARKET AND CALIFORNIA

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:41.116 region:rollup2
COULD BE LEADING THE NATION AND

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:43.352 region:rollup2
MEETING AND EVER GROWING

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:45.387 region:rollup2
SHELLFISH DEMAND WHILE CREATING

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:46.588 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:48.023 region:rollup2
LOCAL BLUE JOBS IN COASTAL

01:23:46.588 --> 01:23:50.626 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:52.094 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE CONFLICTED ABOUT THE

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:53.896 region:rollup2
GROWTH OF THIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:55.264 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND AND UNDERSTOOD

01:23:53.896 --> 01:23:56.798 region:rollup2
EVEN BEFORE THE MOST RECENT

01:23:55.264 --> 01:23:58.767 region:rollup2
SCIENCE ON OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

01:23:56.798 --> 01:24:00.235 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ILL GRASS

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:01.803 region:rollup2
HABITAT. OUGHT TO OVERRIDE A

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:02.938 region:rollup2
WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIES AND AND

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:05.240 region:rollup2
MARRYING SOME OF THE OTHER

01:24:02.938 --> 01:24:08.110 region:rollup2
PANELISTS ON THE FIRST PANEL.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:10.479 region:rollup2
DETAIL THAT I THINK VERY WELL.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:12.147 region:rollup2
ILL GROUSE IS SUPPOSE COULD

01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:13.048 region:rollup2
CRITICAL ASTRON HABITAT FOR A

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:15.350 region:rollup2
WIDE VARIETY OF MARINE

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:17.352 region:rollup2
INVERTEBRATES FISH MAMMALS BIRDS

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:18.921 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS NURSERY GROUNDS.

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:20.422 region:rollup2
FOR FISH.

01:24:18.921 --> 01:24:21.723 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO THE ABILITY TO MODIFY

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:24.126 region:rollup2
THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IT'S

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:25.227 region:rollup2
AN AYE ECOLOGICAL ENGINEER A

01:24:24.126 --> 01:24:27.462 region:rollup2
KEEP SETTLEMENTS IN PLACE AND

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:28.964 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE WATER QUALITY. AND

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:30.799 region:rollup2
SO THE RECENTLY PUBLICIZED.

01:24:28.964 --> 01:24:32.334 region:rollup2
OCEAN ACIDIFICATION BENEFIT

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:32.834 region:rollup2
MITIGATION SCIENCE IS JUST SORT

01:24:32.334 --> 01:24:34.770 region:rollup2
OF THE ICING ON ALREADY

01:24:32.834 --> 01:24:36.371 region:rollup2
VALUABLE.

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:37.539 region:rollup2
CAKE.

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:39.441 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:41.009 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S.

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:42.911 region:rollup2
FINALLY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:44.513 region:rollup2
DO ABOUT OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:45.747 region:rollup2
UNIT WE CAN INCREASE THAT ARE

01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:47.149 region:rollup2
EXPANSIVE SEA GRASS AND OUR

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.916 region:rollup2
MEADOWS AND IT HAS BEEN

01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:49.418 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.552 region:rollup2
WORRIED ABOUT AND THE REASON

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.520 region:rollup2
THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:53.088 region:rollup2
WORRIED ABOUT IT IS THAT ILL

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.557 region:rollup2
GRASS HAS. BEEN UP UNTIL THIS

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:56.592 region:rollup2
POINT AND CONTINUES TO BE.

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:59.661 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:25:01.263 region:rollup2
GREATEST OBSTACLE IN INCREASING.

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:03.031 region:rollup2
SHELLFISH GROWING CAPACITY IN

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:05.167 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:06.835 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ILL GRASS MITIGATION

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:08.937 region:rollup2
POLICY OR THE CAMP AND THAT WAS

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:10.672 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.240 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE LEVEL OF PROTECTION. OF

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:12.975 region:rollup2
FOR THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.243 region:rollup2
HABITAT.

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:17.346 region:rollup2
THE POLICY IS ALSO THE MAJOR

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:19.448 region:rollup2
ARE LIMITING FACTOR IN THE

01:25:17.346 --> 01:25:20.916 region:rollup2
PERMITTING PROCESS AT WHICH AS

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:21.850 region:rollup2
YOU PROBABLY KNOW. A FROM THE

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:24.086 region:rollup2
TIME OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:24.987 region:rollup2
CAN TAKE UPWARDS OF EIGHTEEN

01:25:24.086 --> 01:25:26.922 region:rollup2
MONTHS TO GO FROM.

01:25:24.987 --> 01:25:28.523 region:rollup2
SERVE THE VISUALIZATION OF AN

01:25:26.922 --> 01:25:30.258 region:rollup2
OPERATION TO.

01:25:28.523 --> 01:25:32.394 region:rollup2
ACTUAL OPERATION.

01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:34.363 region:rollup2
THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE

01:25:32.394 --> 01:25:36.164 region:rollup2
CLIENT TO SUPPORT ADVERSE

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:38.633 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF AQUACULTURE ON ILL

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:40.302 region:rollup2
GRASS BUT A LOT OF THAT WAS FROM

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:41.370 region:rollup2
OUR TRADITIONAL AQUACULTURE

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:42.971 region:rollup2

SUBSTRATE AND THEN RAKING THEM

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:49.344 region:rollup2
UP AND NOT SURPRISINGLY ILL

01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:50.045 region:rollup2
GRASS DOESN'T LIKE THAT KIND OF

01:25:49.344 --> 01:25:52.447 region:rollup2
THING.

01:25:50.045 --> 01:25:54.249 region:rollup2
AND SO ON THE OTHER HAND WE

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:55.984 region:rollup2
ALSO HAVE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:57.719 region:rollup2
FROM OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:59.821 region:rollup2
ARE PROPERLY SPACED HANGING

01:25:57.719 --> 01:26:01.723 region:rollup2
BASKETS AND LONG LINES. AYE HAS

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:03.659 region:rollup2
LESS IMPACT AND MAY EVEN HAVE A

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:04.526 region:rollup2
POSITIVE IMPACT ON ILL GRASS

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:06.862 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:08.096 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE VOID

ACTUALLY USING DRONES WILL BE

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.430 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SEE SOME OF THE FOOTAGE

01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:45.967 region:rollup2
FROM THE VIDEO COMING UP.

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:48.036 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT BY DEVELOPING

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:51.606 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE MONITORING

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:53.975 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TO SURVEY ILL GRASS

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:54.810 region:rollup2
SORT OF IN SITU WE CAN ALLOW THE

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:56.878 region:rollup2
AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY AND

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:59.181 region:rollup2
REGULATORY AGENCIES TO PROVIDE

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:10.592 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SO

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:13.095 region:rollup2
ONCE THE MONITORING PROTOCOLS

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:15.197 region:rollup2
BEEN TESTED AND VALIDATED WE

01:27:13.095 --> 01:27:19.134 region:rollup2
INTEND TO HAND OFF TO THE

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:20.268 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY ITSELF. SO THEY CAN BE

01:27:19.134 --> 01:27:22.904 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE IN THEIR

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:26.041 region:rollup2
FIELDS THEY CAN BE MONITORING

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:29.311 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN IMPACTS ON. ON ILL

01:27:26.041 --> 01:27:32.414 region:rollup2
GRASS AND THIS WILL I THINK.

01:27:29.311 --> 01:27:37.786 region:rollup2
AYE EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:40.956 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF DATA ON NOT JUST

01:27:37.786 --> 01:27:44.059 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH OF YOUR GRASS AND IT.

01:27:40.956 --> 01:27:48.497 region:rollup2
TOOK PARTICULAR AND.

01:27:48.497 --> 01:27:51.199 region:rollup2
LOT OF THIS.

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:51.766 region:rollup2
CERTAIN OBSERVATIONAL

01:27:51.199 --> 01:27:57.405 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON PROTOCOL WILL

01:27:51.766 --> 01:28:00.175 region:rollup2
REALLY HELP TO

01:27:57.405 --> 01:28:02.244 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THESE INTERACTIONS

01:28:00.175 --> 01:28:03.111 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE AND I IT'S IT'S WORTH

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:04.012 region:rollup2
SAYING ESPECIALLY WITH REFERENCE

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:08.049 region:rollup2

LAST LAST WINTER'S RAINFALL.

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:18.760 region:rollup2
THOSE MONITORING WITH DRONES

01:28:15.991 --> 01:28:20.162 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS SO CHEAP AND

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.797 region:rollup2
ACCURATE WILL ALLOW US TO GET A

01:28:20.162 --> 01:28:23.365 region:rollup2
TEMPORAL RESOLUTION ON SORT OF

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:26.101 region:rollup2
THE INNER SEASONAL VARIATION

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:28.203 region:rollup2
AND.

01:28:26.101 --> 01:28:30.338 region:rollup2
EELGRASS EXTENT THAT WE'RE NOT

01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:34.409 region:rollup2
WE'RE JUST SIMPLY NOT ABLE TO

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:36.111 region:rollup2
GET BY SENDING DIVERS DOWN THERE

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:37.879 region:rollup2
THEY JUST AREN'T UNWILLING TO

01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:40.081 region:rollup2
ARE UNABLE TO.

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:41.917 region:rollup2
GO DOWN AS OFTEN AS WE NEED TO

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:44.286 region:rollup2
GET THAT KIND OF TEMPORAL

01:28:41.917 --> 01:28:45.921 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION. I'M SO WE'RE REALLY

01:28:44.286 --> 01:28:49.291 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT THIS.

01:28:45.921 --> 01:28:49.791 region:rollup2
HONORING PROTOCOL WILL REALLY

01:28:49.291 --> 01:28:51.126 region:rollup2
INCREASE OUR SCIENTIFIC

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:52.027 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE.

01:28:51.126 --> 01:28:53.595 region:rollup2
I'M SO IN SOME THE INDUSTRY

01:28:52.027 --> 01:28:55.330 region:rollup2
KNOWS BETTER THAN ANYBODY THAT

01:28:53.595 --> 01:28:57.132 region:rollup2
HEALTHY ILL GRASS MEANS MORE

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.900 region:rollup2
OYSTERS AND AN IMPROVED BOTTOM

01:28:57.132 --> 01:28:59.801 region:rollup2
LINE. AND WITH THAT I GUESS I

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.669 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK YOU TO PLAY THIS

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:02.270 region:rollup2
LITTLE INFORMATIONAL VIDEO THAT

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:09.177 region:rollup2
WE'VE PRODUCED.

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:11.846 region:rollup2
NNOVA.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:14.749 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:15.350 region:rollup2
CHOOSE BECOMING ANY

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:16.551 region:rollup2
SILLY IMPORTANT GLOBAL SHOULD

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:17.118 region:rollup2
SORT.

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.752 region:rollup2
AND WITH THIS GROWTH COMES

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:20.455 region:rollup2
URGENT UNANSWERED.

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:22.090 region:rollup2
THE INTERACTION.

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:25.260 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS BOTH POSITIVE AND

01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:26.861 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE WITH OUR EGOS.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.662 region:rollup2
AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE ARE

01:29:26.861 --> 01:29:29.531 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON ADDRESSING MANY OF

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:31.1000 region:rollup2
THESE IN PART

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:33.034 region:rollup2
BY BRINGING TOGETHER SO

01:29:31.1000 --> 01:29:33.835 region:rollup2
TESTS AND INDUSTRY AND TOMORROW

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:35.704 region:rollup2

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:39.341 region:rollup2
MONITOR ONE PARTICULAR EGOS.

GIL GRASS

01:29:39.341 --> 01:29:45.680 region:rollup2
THE.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.082 region:rollup2

IN ASTRI.

01:29:48.016 --> 01:29:52.821 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:29:51.253 --> 01:29:53.655 region:rollup2
SO IT'S HOMES FOR

01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:55.323 region:rollup2
A LOT OF INVERTEBRATES.

01:29:53.655 --> 01:29:56.891 region:rollup2

FOR JUVENILE STAGES OF FISH

01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.829 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SOME

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:05.200 region:rollup2
FULL IMPORTANT.

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:06.001 region:rollup2
HE'S.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.235 region:rollup2
STILL PARADIGM IS.

CULTURE ACT

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:15.043 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:17.979 region:rollup2
I'M STILL TO SEE GASES HOWEVER

01:30:15.043 --> 01:30:18.613 region:rollup2
UP PARTNERS AT HOMETOWN LISTA

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:20.982 region:rollup2
COMPANIES HAVE.

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:21.583 region:rollup2
OBSERVE THAT

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:23.918 region:rollup2
SOME INSTANCES THE HILL GRASS

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:25.787 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:28.189 region:rollup2
SO THERE AQUACULTURE TERRIBLE

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:28.623 region:rollup2
EXPAND INTO THEIR LEASES AND

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:31.026 region:rollup2
GROW IN AND AROUND.

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:31.893 region:rollup2

01:30:31.026 --> 01:30:33.028 region:rollup2
WE THE FUNNY SELFISH

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:36.631 region:rollup2
JUST ABOUT

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:39.734 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS.

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:41.469 region:rollup2
AND I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN THAT

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:43.872 region:rollup2
IS AMONG THE MOST SUSTAINABLE

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:46.608 region:rollup2
WAYS TO TO GROW ANIMAL PROTEIN.

01:30:43.872 --> 01:30:48.276 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY IS FOR DOING AT ALL

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:50.245 region:rollup2
IN THESE IN YOUR SHORT FIREMAN.

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:51.880 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHERE HE'S RESOURCES

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:52.514 region:rollup2
LIKE YOUR GLASS ARE.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.348 region:rollup2
BEING IN A BUSINESS WHERE YOU

TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HIM.

01:30:53.348 --> 01:30:56.251 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE ABOUT

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:56.851 region:rollup2
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT USING

01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:58.720 region:rollup2
SCIENCE IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:59.888 region:rollup2
PART?

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.455 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN CHANGES OUT HERE IN

01:30:59.888 --> 01:31:02.490 region:rollup2
THE SAY OVER THE PAST THIRTY

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:03.692 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:07.195 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THE GROWTH IN THE THE

01:31:03.692 --> 01:31:10.065 region:rollup2
EXPANSION OF THE REAL GRASS BEDS

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:12.701 region:rollup2
WE A BUFFER AREAS THAT ALL THE

SUDDEN THE ADDRESSES MOVED IN.

01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:15.070 region:rollup2
WE HAVE QUESTIONS WE HAVE THAT

01:31:14.436 --> 01:31:15.837 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE ANSWERED OVER TIME.

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:16.471 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE?

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:18.340 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE DEBT?

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:20.342 region:rollup2
THE NEGATIVE.

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:21.943 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A TOOL DEVELOPED THAT IS

01:31:20.342 --> 01:31:25.847 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE ENOUGH THE

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:27.949 region:rollup2
GROWERS GENERAL CAN USE.

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:29.150 region:rollup2
WOULD BE. USING BENEFICIAL BUT

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:30.085 region:rollup2
THERE'S. UNCERTAINTY.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.386 region:rollup2

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:34.155 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:35.890 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND OUR AFFECTS

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.691 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE POSITIVE.

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:37.692 region:rollup2
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT STUDY

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:39.828 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HELP US

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:42.831 region:rollup2
ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:45.767 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY NOT JUST LOST PAYMENT

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:47.469 region:rollup2
BAY IS ALL AROUND US.

01:31:45.767 --> 01:31:48.103 region:rollup2
ANSWER THESE.

01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:02.384 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

01:32:01.316 --> 01:32:03.852 region:rollup2
VALUABLE CAN.

01:32:02.384 --> 01:32:06.588 region:rollup2
FORMATION.

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:10.158 region:rollup2
ILL GRAB.

01:32:06.588 --> 01:32:10.725 region:rollup2
OPERATION.

01:32:10.158 --> 01:32:12.727 region:rollup2
THE RESEARCHERS AT UC SANTA

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:14.029 region:rollup2
CRUZ.

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:15.397 region:rollup2
TELL BROWN.

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:16.765 region:rollup2
TERMINATION.

01:32:15.397 --> 01:32:17.565 region:rollup2
WHERE THE YOU'LL GRAB?

01:32:16.765 --> 01:32:19.801 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN USE THAT

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:23.538 region:rollup2
TWO FIVE.

01:32:19.801 --> 01:32:24.439 region:rollup2
IN OTHER IN.

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:26.641 region:rollup2
BEING THAT WE'VE RECOVERING A

01:32:24.439 --> 01:32:29.244 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LARGER AREA.

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:32.514 region:rollup2
GO ON FROM MULTIPLE YEARS CAN.

01:32:29.244 --> 01:32:33.548 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK.

01:32:32.514 --> 01:32:34.048 region:rollup2
NOW THAT ONLY OVER THE YEARS

01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:36.317 region:rollup2
IN TALKING TO THE NATURE

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:38.753 region:rollup2
CONSERVANCY

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:40.422 region:rollup2
NEVER DID UNDERSTAND IT THAT WAS

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:41.256 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN THE BUILDING DID

01:32:40.422 --> 01:32:42.490 region:rollup2
HONEST

01:32:41.256 --> 01:32:43.057 region:rollup2
OPUS.

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:44.826 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A STUDY FINE I COULD

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:45.460 region:rollup2
PARTNERS

01:32:44.826 --> 01:32:47.762 region:rollup2
AND LOOK AT THIS ISSUE IN THAT

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:48.396 region:rollup2
REALM.

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:51.433 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:52.600 region:rollup2
WILL HELP ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.

01:32:51.433 --> 01:32:55.403 region:rollup2
THIS THING IS WE ARE THE BEST

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:56.571 region:rollup2
PARTNERS

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:57.038 region:rollup2
WE GET THIS DATA BECAUSE WE'RE

01:32:56.571 --> 01:32:58.273 region:rollup2
OUT OF ALL THE TIME.

01:32:57.038 --> 01:33:00.642 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD KNOW

01:32:58.273 --> 01:33:01.342 region:rollup2
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S GOING.

01:33:00.642 --> 01:33:03.244 region:rollup2
I FEEL AS IF YOU WILL.

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:03.812 region:rollup2
SO TO ME THIS IS.

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:04.546 region:rollup2
WHAT'S REALLY EXCITING ABOUT

01:33:03.812 --> 01:33:05.380 region:rollup2
THE.

01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:06.714 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:08.450 region:rollup2
RESEARCH TO FILL GAPS IN OUR

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:09.417 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOUR GRASS

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:11.052 region:rollup2
CULTURE INTERACTIONS HAS NEVER

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.953 region:rollup2
BEEN MORE URGENT.

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:12.587 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS THAT

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:14.088 region:rollup2
UNITE INDUSTRY.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:16.691 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:17.459 region:rollup2
AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:19.828 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL TO HELP PROMOTE

01:33:17.459 --> 01:33:20.728 region:rollup2
HEALTHY EGOS.

01:33:19.828 --> 01:33:37.111 region:rollup2
AND CHANGE THE WAY WE SURPRISE

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:37.111 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD FROM

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:52.127 region:rollup2
.

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:53.161 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:53.695 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:55.897 region:rollup2
STONE FOR THE INVITATION.

01:33:53.695 --> 01:33:56.731 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:33:55.897 --> 01:33:57.799 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY PLEASURE TO BE HERE

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.800 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:33:57.799 --> 01:33:59.701 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.068 region:rollup2
ON AND I JUST FIRST WANT TO

01:33:59.701 --> 01:34:01.569 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT THAT.

01:34:00.068 --> 01:34:02.370 region:rollup2
.

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:03.037 region:rollup2
ALL TALK ABOUT SOME WORK THAT

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:04.305 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN DOING IN COLLABORATION

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:06.508 region:rollup2
WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:08.076 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S MANY SCIENTISTS THAT

01:34:06.508 --> 01:34:09.077 region:rollup2
WORK ON THAT'S I'M I MAKE HOUSE

01:34:08.076 --> 01:34:10.678 region:rollup2
IN NORTHRIDGE THEIR SCIENTISTS

01:34:09.077 --> 01:34:11.613 region:rollup2
PRIME STANFORD UNIVERSITY

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:13.882 region:rollup2
HOPKINS MARINE STATION AT UC

01:34:11.613 --> 01:34:15.984 region:rollup2
DAVIS AND WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERS

01:34:13.882 --> 01:34:17.852 region:rollup2
WITH THE BAY FOUNDATION. WHICH

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:19.220 region:rollup2
TO ENTER INTO THE MICROPHONE

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.888 region:rollup2
BEGIN HERE AND FOR THE RECORD

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.122 region:rollup2
YET SO WE HAVE.

01:34:19.888 --> 01:34:22.090 region:rollup2
ALSO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:23.525 region:rollup2
THE BAY FOUNDATION WHICH IS.

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:24.993 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT'S

01:34:23.525 --> 01:34:26.794 region:rollup2
BEEN MENTIONED I MANY TIMES

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:27.996 region:rollup2
ALREADY SO ALL BEACH SORT OF

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:32.233 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE FOCUS FROM

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:33.468 region:rollup2
SEAGRASSES OVER TO HELP.

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:34.869 region:rollup2
SO I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT SOME

01:34:33.468 --> 01:34:36.070 region:rollup2
RESULTS WE HAVE SOME FROM

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:37.505 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROJECTS OF THE FIRST

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:39.641 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IS THAT IT WAS REALLY

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:41.209 region:rollup2
THIS BASELINE DATA OF SEA WATER

01:34:39.641 --> 01:34:42.310 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY NICK HELP FOREST AND.

01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:44.178 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY STARTED OFF AS A

01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:45.513 region:rollup2
SIDE PROJECT THAT HAD NO FUNDING

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:47.482 region:rollup2
BEHIND IT AND WE WERE ABLE TO

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:48.116 region:rollup2
JUST COBBLE TOGETHER PEOPLE THAT

01:34:47.482 --> 01:34:50.285 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WERE INTERESTED IN THE

01:34:48.116 --> 01:34:51.352 region:rollup2
STATE. AND NOT SOME SOME WORK

01:34:50.285 --> 01:34:52.620 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED THAT

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:53.922 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING ON AND THEN THESE

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.990 region:rollup2
TWO OTHER STUDIES.

01:34:53.922 --> 01:34:57.358 region:rollup2
KIND OF CAME OUT OF THAT DOT IS

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:58.593 region:rollup2
FIRST SORT OF EFFORT BECAUSE

01:34:57.358 --> 01:35:00.595 region:rollup2
PEOPLE REALLY INTEREST IN THESE

01:34:58.593 --> 01:35:02.363 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BUT THERE WAS REALLY

01:35:00.595 --> 01:35:04.699 region:rollup2
NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT.

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:06.100 region:rollup2
CUT FORESTS AND THEIR POTENTIAL

01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:08.536 region:rollup2
TO MILITARY WATER CHEMISTRY.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:09.470 region:rollup2
SO FOLLOWING UP ON THAT NOW I'M

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.505 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FUNDING FROM THE

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:12.574 region:rollup2
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION TO

01:35:10.505 --> 01:35:16.211 region:rollup2
DO A REALLY MECHANISTIC STUDY TO

01:35:12.574 --> 01:35:18.680 region:rollup2
QUANTIFY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN.

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:20.848 region:rollup2
HOW BIG THE CULT FOREST IS WHAT

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:23.551 region:rollup2
THE OCEANOGRAPHY LOOKS LIKE IN

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:25.653 region:rollup2
THE AREA AND THEN THE IMPACT ON

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:28.156 region:rollup2
THE SEA WATER CHEMISTRY AND? WE

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:30.091 region:rollup2
REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU

01:35:28.156 --> 01:35:32.193 region:rollup2
WHERE OR WHEN AND SO WE

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:35.263 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THOSE MECHANISMS AND

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:36.764 region:rollup2
THE SORT OF INTERPLAY BETWEEN

01:35:35.263 --> 01:35:38.066 region:rollup2
THOSE DIFFERENT I'M FACTORS.

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:39.300 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY I'M THIS UP IN

01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:39.867 region:rollup2
THIS NEW PROJECT THAT STARTING

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.736 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:43.438 region:rollup2
THAT'S FUNDED BY U. S. CITIES

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.706 region:rollup2
SEE GRANT PROGRAM WE'RE LOOKING

01:35:43.438 --> 01:35:46.941 region:rollup2
AT RESTORATION STATES THAT THE

01:35:44.706 --> 01:35:48.042 region:rollup2
BAY FOUNDATION ARE DOING SO SO

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:49.244 region:rollup2
THE CALPERS FRUSTRATION IN

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:51.179 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:35:49.244 --> 01:35:52.113 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO GOING INTO THOSE

01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:53.248 region:rollup2
URCHIN PARENTS AND MANUALLY

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:54.649 region:rollup2
REMOVING HER CHANCEL THOSE

01:35:53.248 --> 01:35:55.483 region:rollup2
URCHINS ARE THERE BECAUSE OF

01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:56.251 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT

01:35:55.483 --> 01:35:57.452 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF THINKING OF

01:35:56.251 --> 01:35:58.786 region:rollup2
THE LANCE THE INTERFACE BECAUSE.

01:35:57.452 --> 01:35:59.420 region:rollup2
THE REASON NOT THAT URCHINS WERE

01:35:58.786 --> 01:36:00.321 region:rollup2
ABLE TO REALLY GET A STRONGHOLD

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.222 region:rollup2
WAS BECAUSE OF POLLUTION AND

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:02.257 region:rollup2
OTHER SORT OF MULTIPLE STRESSORS

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:03.992 region:rollup2
THAT WERE OCCURRING.

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:05.326 region:rollup2
AND SO NOW IS THAT SOME OF THE

01:36:03.992 --> 01:36:06.127 region:rollup2
STRESSES ARE REMOVED I'M YOU

01:36:05.326 --> 01:36:06.894 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE

01:36:06.127 --> 01:36:07.762 region:rollup2
REMOVING OUR CHANCE AND WE'RE

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:10.798 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT AS THIS CULT IS

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:11.099 region:rollup2
COMING IN. WERE INVOLVED IN THAT

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:12.400 region:rollup2
THE EFFORT.

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:13.267 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.302 region:rollup2
I'M WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:14.969 region:rollup2
THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY LOOKING

01:36:14.302 --> 01:36:15.637 region:rollup2
AT THE POTENTIAL FOR WAVE

01:36:14.969 --> 01:36:16.471 region:rollup2
ATTENUATION OF CULT FOREST WHICH

01:36:15.637 --> 01:36:17.639 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THIS ADDITIONAL

01:36:16.471 --> 01:36:19.040 region:rollup2
ECOSYSTEM SERVICE ON TOP OF ALL

01:36:17.639 --> 01:36:20.408 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.943 region:rollup2
THEY RD PROVIDE. AND THE NOW

01:36:20.408 --> 01:36:23.544 region:rollup2
WE'RE FINALLY GONNA START SEEING

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:25.079 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:26.481 region:rollup2
HABITAT THAT WAS DEVOID OF KELP

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:27.548 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT CHEMISTRY LOOK LIKE

01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:28.916 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT IS THE CHEMISTRY

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:31.519 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE ONCE WE HAVE A HEALTHY

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:32.153 region:rollup2
CUP FORCE THAT'S GROWING SO. WE

01:36:31.519 --> 01:36:33.655 region:rollup2
NOW HAVE FUNDING TO LOOK AT THAT

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:35.390 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:36:33.655 --> 01:36:37.191 region:rollup2
SO FIRST I JUST WANTED TO YOU

01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:38.860 region:rollup2
KNOW SORT OF REMIND US ALL WHAT

01:36:37.191 --> 01:36:40.261 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE TO BE IN A CUP FOREST

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:42.397 region:rollup2
IF YOU'VE BEEN IN A CULT FOREST.

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:43.931 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU KNOW MOST OF THE

01:36:42.397 --> 01:36:45.700 region:rollup2
BIOMASS IS THAT THE SURFACE SO

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:46.801 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THESE MASSIVE CANOPY

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:48.202 region:rollup2
IS THAT YOU CAN SEE FROM

01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:50.138 region:rollup2
SATELLITE IMAGES WHICH ARE

01:36:48.202 --> 01:36:51.005 region:rollup2
REALLY HANDY IN TERMS OF MAPPING

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:53.374 region:rollup2
THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF COUPLE ON

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:55.076 region:rollup2
THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:56.644 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE CULT

01:36:55.076 --> 01:36:57.645 region:rollup2
IS ALTERING THE HABITAT AND IT'S

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:58.913 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE WAY IT'S

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:00.548 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE WAY

01:36:58.913 --> 01:37:02.316 region:rollup2
THE WATER MOVES IN THIS AREA

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:03.985 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A SOLID

01:37:02.316 --> 01:37:04.585 region:rollup2
OBJECT AND WATER MOVING RIGHT.

01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:06.254 region:rollup2
IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE SOLID

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:07.689 region:rollup2
OBJECTS IT'S EITHER GONNA HAVE

01:37:06.254 --> 01:37:09.223 region:rollup2
TO GO AROUND HER OR DO SOMETHING

01:37:07.689 --> 01:37:10.558 region:rollup2
OR SLOW DOWN TO GO THROUGH THOSE

01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:12.260 region:rollup2
AREAS AND SO THERE'S SOME REALLY

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:14.128 region:rollup2
INTERESTING FEEDBACKS BETWEEN

01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:15.396 region:rollup2
THAT HELP ITSELF. AND THE

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.764 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:19.133 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT AND HOW MUCH

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:21.302 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL YOU HAVE TO MODIFY THE

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:21.969 region:rollup2
WATER COLUMN.

01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:23.438 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE STILL YOU KNOW A LOT

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:24.639 region:rollup2
OF BIOMASS THAT'S UNDER WATER AS

01:37:23.438 --> 01:37:26.140 region:rollup2
WELL AND IT YOU KNOW JUST

01:37:24.639 --> 01:37:27.809 region:rollup2
FURTHER ADDS TO THIS IDEA THAT

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.010 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIS PHYSICAL STRUCTURE

01:37:27.809 --> 01:37:30.545 region:rollup2
THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE WATER

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:32.780 region:rollup2
COLUMN YOU KNOW FROM THIRTY TO

01:37:30.545 --> 01:37:34.615 region:rollup2
FIFTY FEET THAT. IS ALSO

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.250 region:rollup2
IMPACTING ON THESE HABITATS AND

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:38.086 region:rollup2
REALLY INTERESTING WAYS AND SO

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:39.587 region:rollup2
ARE SORT OF TAKE ON THIS IS TO

01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:40.822 region:rollup2
MEASURE ALL OF THOSE THINGS

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:43.157 region:rollup2
REALLY GET A HANDLE ON THE

01:37:40.822 --> 01:37:45.993 region:rollup2
OCEANOGRAPHY. ON WHAT THAT HELP

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:47.795 region:rollup2
IS DOING AND THE CHEMISTRY.

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:49.697 region:rollup2
SO HERE'S I'M SOME OF WHAT WE

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:51.966 region:rollup2
KNOW SO FAR TO ANSWER THIS

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:53.968 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT IF HOPE FOR ITS

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:55.269 region:rollup2
CAN USED AS A MANAGEMENT TOOL TO

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:55.837 region:rollup2
MITIGATE XIN ACIDIFICATION. SO

01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:57.872 region:rollup2
THERE DEFINITELY IS SOME

01:37:55.837 --> 01:37:59.273 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR HELP AND THERE'S

01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:00.308 region:rollup2
SOME INDICATION THAT CALPERS

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:01.609 region:rollup2
LOCALLY RAISE P. H..

01:38:00.308 --> 01:38:03.444 region:rollup2
.

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:04.746 region:rollup2
IN IN SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:06.013 region:rollup2
TIME SERIOUS FROM THIS WORK THAT

01:38:04.746 --> 01:38:07.415 region:rollup2
WE DID WHICH WAS I'M SAMPLING

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:09.150 region:rollup2
OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. AYE

01:38:07.415 --> 01:38:10.218 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INSIDE AND

01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:12.019 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THAT HELP FOREST OF UP

01:38:10.218 --> 01:38:13.688 region:rollup2
TO ZERO POINT FIVE PEACH UNITS

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:15.156 region:rollup2
AT TIMES AND ALSO THERE'S A

01:38:13.688 --> 01:38:17.058 region:rollup2
REALLY INTERESTING VERTICAL

01:38:15.156 --> 01:38:18.993 region:rollup2
GRADIENT SO. I'M.

01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:20.395 region:rollup2
AT THE SURFACE THE BEAT THE

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:21.262 region:rollup2
PEACH AS HIGH AS WHICH MAKES

01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:22.630 region:rollup2
SENSE BECAUSE THAT'S AGAIN OR

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:23.931 region:rollup2
MOST OF THIS CULT MATERIAL IS

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:26.234 region:rollup2
LOCATED.

01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:27.535 region:rollup2
AND THEN AT THE BOTTOM THAT

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:29.203 region:rollup2
PEACH WITH HIGHEST AT A SITE

01:38:27.535 --> 01:38:30.338 region:rollup2
WITH LOW WAVE ACTIVITIES SO WE

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:31.906 region:rollup2
LOOK TO SI.

01:38:30.338 --> 01:38:32.940 region:rollup2
THIS BIG HELP FOR US IN FRONT

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:34.375 region:rollup2
OF HOPKINS MARINE STATION NEXT

01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.476 region:rollup2
THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM. AND

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:37.278 region:rollup2
THE SITE THAT WAS MORE WE'VE

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:38.746 region:rollup2
PROTECTED HIDE A BIGGER

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:39.914 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:41.783 region:rollup2
BUT THE SITE THAT HAD MORE WE'VE

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:42.917 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE THERE SO MUCH WATER

01:38:41.783 --> 01:38:44.385 region:rollup2
MOTION THAT IT BASICALLY JUST

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:46.320 region:rollup2
GOT SPLASHED OUT THERE'S NOT

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:48.289 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TIME AT THE BOTTOM. FOR

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.357 region:rollup2
THAT HELP TO REALLY MAKE ANY

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:50.358 region:rollup2
KIND OF AN IMPACT

01:38:49.357 --> 01:38:51.993 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY

01:38:50.358 --> 01:38:53.694 region:rollup2
DATA THAT WAS I'M TAKEN IN

01:38:51.993 --> 01:38:55.663 region:rollup2
CONJUNCTION WITH THIS EFFORT

01:38:53.694 --> 01:38:56.764 region:rollup2
WITH ON THE BAY FOUNDATION AND A

01:38:55.663 --> 01:38:57.765 region:rollup2
PHD STUDENT CRESCENT ELSEWHERE

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.534 region:rollup2
FROM UC DAVIS.

01:38:57.765 --> 01:39:00.334 region:rollup2
AT THIS CUP FOREST RESTORATION

01:38:59.534 --> 01:39:03.971 region:rollup2
SITE WHERE.

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:05.573 region:rollup2
WE TOOK SOME.

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:06.908 region:rollup2
DODD SOME CHEMISTRY DATA AND YOU

01:39:05.573 --> 01:39:09.177 region:rollup2
CAN SEE FROM THIS POT THAT THESE

01:39:06.908 --> 01:39:11.412 region:rollup2
THESE BROWN MARKS ARE SHOWING.

01:39:09.177 --> 01:39:12.580 region:rollup2
THAT HELP ABUNDANCE THERE TIME

01:39:11.412 --> 01:39:13.481 region:rollup2
AND SO SHOWING THAT YOU NOTED

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.749 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:39:13.481 --> 01:39:16.617 region:rollup2
RESTORATION THEY REMOVED URCHINS

01:39:14.749 --> 01:39:17.585 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW THE COP WASN'T THERE

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:19.654 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE CULT STARTED COMING

01:39:17.585 --> 01:39:20.755 region:rollup2
IN. AND WE SAMPLED SOME OF THE

01:39:19.654 --> 01:39:21.823 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY AND I WAS THE COP

01:39:20.755 --> 01:39:23.658 region:rollup2
STARTED GROWING AND WE

01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:26.027 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY SAW IT THIS INCREASE

01:39:23.658 --> 01:39:26.861 region:rollup2
IN PH THE WILL BE. GOING BACK TO

01:39:26.027 --> 01:39:28.329 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SIGHTS AND AN

01:39:26.861 --> 01:39:32.800 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESTORATION SITES TO

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:34.068 region:rollup2
COLLECT. MORE DATA.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.404 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW SORT OF WHERE

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:38.806 region:rollup2
WE'RE AT NOW BUT WE STILL HAVE A

01:39:36.404 --> 01:39:39.740 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIME QUESTIONS AND WE'RE

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:41.442 region:rollup2
WORKING ON SOME STUFF THAT I

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:42.777 region:rollup2
THINK WILL REALLY ALLOW US TO

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:43.911 region:rollup2
ADVANCE THE ANSWERS TO THIS

01:39:42.777 --> 01:39:45.913 region:rollup2
QUESTION OVER THE NEXT TWO TO

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:47.114 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS.

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:48.749 region:rollup2
SO FIRST YOU KNOW UNDER WHAT

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:50.051 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS SHOULD WE EXPECT A

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:51.419 region:rollup2
CULT FOREST EFFECT ON CHEMISTRY

01:39:50.051 --> 01:39:53.054 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

01:39:51.419 --> 01:39:55.223 region:rollup2
QUANTIFY MECHANISTICALLY THE

01:39:53.054 --> 01:39:56.757 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN. CUT FOR A

01:39:55.223 --> 01:39:57.959 region:rollup2
SITE IS THE LOCAL LOCAL

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:59.894 region:rollup2
OCEANOGRAPHY AND THE SEA WATER

01:39:57.959 --> 01:40:02.697 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY AND NOT YOU KNOW IS

01:39:59.894 --> 01:40:04.432 region:rollup2
REALLY GONNA ALLOW US TO SEE. IN

01:40:02.697 --> 01:40:05.800 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR HABITAT THAT HAS

01:40:04.432 --> 01:40:07.335 region:rollup2
THIS SORT OF WAVE ENVIRONMENT

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.903 region:rollup2
YES LIKE WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:09.604 region:rollup2
IN A FACT OR MAYBE NO WE

01:40:08.903 --> 01:40:11.138 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T EXPECT ISSUE THAT

01:40:09.604 --> 01:40:12.440 region:rollup2
AFFECTS THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:13.908 region:rollup2
BIG GOAL. I MEAN WILL BE

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.976 region:rollup2
COLLECTING DATA.

01:40:13.908 --> 01:40:16.444 region:rollup2
THIS SUMMER AND MODERATE A

01:40:14.976 --> 01:40:18.012 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SITES AND THE

01:40:16.444 --> 01:40:19.247 region:rollup2
NEXT SUMMER I'M AS WELL AND

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:20.882 region:rollup2
WE'RE SORT OF TARGETING THE TIME

01:40:19.247 --> 01:40:21.983 region:rollup2
WHEN WE KNOW THE CULPRIT OF IS

01:40:20.882 --> 01:40:23.951 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST WILL BE WHAT

01:40:21.983 --> 01:40:24.852 region:rollup2
EXPECTANCY A DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:26.420 region:rollup2
DURING WINNER WHEN THE COPS

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:27.688 region:rollup2
ENOUGH SAYS THERE REALLY ISN'T

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:28.689 region:rollup2
ANY DIFFERENCE INSIDE AND

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.725 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE BECAUSE THAT HELP IS AT

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:31.893 region:rollup2
SUCH A LOW DENSITY BUT WILL BE

01:40:30.725 --> 01:40:35.096 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SORT OF PUT SOME.

01:40:31.893 --> 01:40:35.963 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BOUNDS ON THOSE TYPES

01:40:35.096 --> 01:40:37.632 region:rollup2
OF RELATIONSHIPS.

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:39.133 region:rollup2
AND HEN YOU KNOW THE NEXT

01:40:37.632 --> 01:40:40.534 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS CUT FOREST

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:41.569 region:rollup2
RESTORATION LEAD TO A CHANGE IN

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:42.703 region:rollup2
SEA WATER CHEMISTRY SERVICES

01:40:41.569 --> 01:40:44.238 region:rollup2
WORK WILL BE DOING OVER THE NEXT

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:45.539 region:rollup2
YEAR WE'RE GONNA MEASURE CHANGES

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:46.941 region:rollup2
IN SEA WATER CHEMISTRY WHEN HIS

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:48.175 region:rollup2
CUP FORESTS ARE RESTORED. SO

01:40:46.941 --> 01:40:49.577 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT IS STARTING RIGHT

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:51.078 region:rollup2
NOW BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS ARE

01:40:49.577 --> 01:40:52.413 region:rollup2
STARTING RIGHT NOW AND SO YOU

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:54.015 region:rollup2
KNOW REALLY WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:55.216 region:rollup2
SOME THINGS I'M I THINK PRETTY

01:40:54.015 --> 01:40:56.484 region:rollup2
SOON WITHIN THE NEXT. TWO TO

01:40:55.216 --> 01:40:58.252 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS I MEAN WE ARE ABLE

01:40:56.484 --> 01:40:59.754 region:rollup2
THAT TO DO SOME SOME GOOD WORK

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:01.422 region:rollup2
WITH WITHOUT FUNDING AND I'M

01:40:59.754 --> 01:41:02.623 region:rollup2
EXCITED THAT NOW WE HAVE FUNDING

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:03.791 region:rollup2
FROM THE FROM THE FEDERAL

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:05.726 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO YOU

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:07.762 region:rollup2
I'M REALLY ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE

01:41:05.726 --> 01:41:08.829 region:rollup2
ON THESE TOPICS.

01:41:07.762 --> 01:41:09.964 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU KNOW WHERE IN THE

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:11.132 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE

01:41:09.964 --> 01:41:12.500 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE PROTECTION AND

01:41:11.132 --> 01:41:14.001 region:rollup2
RESTORATION LOTS OF COURSE THIS

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.836 region:rollup2
BIG QUESTION THAT PEOPLE WANT TO

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:17.471 region:rollup2
KNOW AND AND FROM RESULTS OF

01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:18.673 region:rollup2
THESE TWO STUDIES. WE SHOULD BE

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.774 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PREDICT WHEN AND WHERE

01:41:18.673 --> 01:41:21.242 region:rollup2
HELP FOREST'S WILL HAVE AN

01:41:19.774 --> 01:41:23.044 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON CHEMISTRY AND SO AGAIN

01:41:21.242 --> 01:41:25.346 region:rollup2
I THINK ABOUT THAT THE SORT OF

01:41:23.044 --> 01:41:25.947 region:rollup2
END OF THE DATA COLLECTION BASIN

01:41:25.346 --> 01:41:27.582 region:rollup2
AS WERE TRYING TO PUT ALL THE

01:41:25.947 --> 01:41:29.617 region:rollup2
PIECES TOGETHER. HOPEFULLY

01:41:27.582 --> 01:41:31.686 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE NEXT TWO THREE YEARS

01:41:29.617 --> 01:41:33.654 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE SOME ANSWERS FOR YOU.

01:41:31.686 --> 01:41:40.027 region:rollup2
SO IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS.

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:42.697 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS.

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:44.432 region:rollup2
BUT MOST BUT NOT. ALL.

01:41:42.697 --> 01:41:45.700 region:rollup2
OKAY SO SO I GUESS THAT AFTER

01:41:44.432 --> 01:41:46.367 region:rollup2
MECHANISTIC STUDIES WE SHOULD BE

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.601 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THE IT'S AND.

01:41:46.367 --> 01:41:49.136 region:rollup2
AND THIS THE REALLY COOL THING

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:50.471 region:rollup2
ABOUT HELP IS THAT.

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:51.939 region:rollup2
IT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK DONE

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:53.975 region:rollup2
ON MAPPING ALREADY AND BECAUSE

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:54.709 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEEK HELP AND SATELLITES

01:41:53.975 --> 01:41:57.678 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIS WHOLE TEAM OF

01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:59.146 region:rollup2
PEOPLE I'M LED BY TOM BELL AYE

01:41:57.678 --> 01:42:01.415 region:rollup2
AYE UC SANTA BARBARA AND KYLE

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:03.284 region:rollup2
CAVANAUGH AT UCLA. WHERE THEY

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:04.952 region:rollup2
HAVE REALLY DONE THE WORK AND

01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:06.487 region:rollup2
THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE EIGHTIES

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:08.389 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT HISTORICAL SATELLITE

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:10.224 region:rollup2
IMAGES AND COME OUT ALL OF THE

01:42:08.389 --> 01:42:11.292 region:rollup2
CULT FORESTS THAT WERE ALONG

01:42:10.224 --> 01:42:13.728 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE NOW

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:15.062 region:rollup2
EXPANDING IT UP ALONG THE WHOLE

01:42:13.728 --> 01:42:16.697 region:rollup2
WEST COAST OF THE U. S.?

01:42:15.062 --> 01:42:18.799 region:rollup2
AND TOM AS A COLLABORATOR ON ON

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:20.668 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT IDEAL AND SO WE

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:22.236 region:rollup2
WILL BE ABLE TO AND THEY CAN

01:42:20.668 --> 01:42:23.604 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOK AT WHICH CUT FOR US

01:42:22.236 --> 01:42:24.472 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN THE MOST PERSISTENT

01:42:23.604 --> 01:42:25.840 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK IS ANOTHER BIG

01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:26.507 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE OF WHICH

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.975 region:rollup2
ONES YOU MIGHT WANT TO

01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:29.410 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE. FOR PROTECTION AND

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:31.746 region:rollup2
RESTORATION SO.

01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:32.913 region:rollup2
SO IN YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT

01:42:31.746 --> 01:42:34.615 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:36.484 region:rollup2
CONJUNCTION WITH THE MAPPING IT

01:42:34.615 --> 01:42:38.953 region:rollup2
THERE'S UP I THINK A REALLY BIG

01:42:36.484 --> 01:42:40.521 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL HAD. TIME TO DO SOME

01:42:38.953 --> 01:42:42.323 region:rollup2
GOOD WORK IN THE FUTURE.

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:44.792 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S.

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:46.060 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PROJECTS COMING ON

01:42:44.792 --> 01:42:47.862 region:rollup2
BOARD I'M SURE YOU KNOW ABOUT

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:49.530 region:rollup2
THERE'S ARTIFICIAL REEFS GOING

01:42:47.862 --> 01:42:51.399 region:rollup2
AND AND THE USER ACTUALLY REALLY

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:52.700 region:rollup2
GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLECT

01:42:51.399 --> 01:42:54.101 region:rollup2
SIMILAR DATA TO THAT THAT WERE

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.303 region:rollup2
ALREADY COLLECTING. SO THAT WE

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:57.304 region:rollup2
CAN YOU KNOW.

01:42:56.303 --> 01:42:58.205 region:rollup2
SAMPLE MORE AND MORE SITES AT

01:42:57.304 --> 01:43:00.207 region:rollup2
THAT THIS POINT IT'S IT'S A

01:42:58.205 --> 01:43:01.308 region:rollup2
LIMITATION OF YOU KNOW WE CAN'T

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:02.677 region:rollup2
BE IN ALL OF THESE PLACES AT

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:04.078 region:rollup2
ONCE AND SO TRYING TO SAMPLE AS

01:43:02.677 --> 01:43:05.579 region:rollup2
MANY SITES AS POSSIBLE. TO

01:43:04.078 --> 01:43:06.914 region:rollup2
REALLY FILL OUT THAT SPACE TO

01:43:05.579 --> 01:43:07.948 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHERE AND WHEN WE

01:43:06.914 --> 01:43:09.684 region:rollup2
SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:11.252 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE HELP ON THAT WATER CON

01:43:09.684 --> 01:43:12.453 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY.

01:43:11.252 --> 01:43:13.354 region:rollup2
SO I THINK MOVING FORWARD

01:43:12.453 --> 01:43:15.056 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:16.724 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE. AND

01:43:15.056 --> 01:43:17.925 region:rollup2
THEN LASTLY THERE'S REALLY I

01:43:16.724 --> 01:43:19.493 region:rollup2
AGREE EFFORTS GOING ON IN OTHER

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:21.328 region:rollup2
STE AND OTHER STATES AND EVEN

01:43:19.493 --> 01:43:23.698 region:rollup2
JUST PREPARING TO BE HERE TODAY

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:25.1000 region:rollup2
I SPOKE WITH. PEOPLE OUT I'M

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:27.468 region:rollup2
FROM WASHINGTON STATE WHO ARE

01:43:25.1000 --> 01:43:28.436 region:rollup2
THEY RIGHT NOW HAVE A TWO AND A

01:43:27.468 --> 01:43:29.770 region:rollup2
HALF ACRE.

01:43:28.436 --> 01:43:32.306 region:rollup2
CULT AQUACULTURE CITE SUGAR

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:33.874 region:rollup2
CULT AND THEY HAVE THEIR IT'S A

01:43:32.306 --> 01:43:35.609 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH.

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:36.911 region:rollup2
AQUACULTURE WITH.

01:43:35.609 --> 01:43:38.446 region:rollup2
.

01:43:36.911 --> 01:43:40.448 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES WITH FEDERAL

01:43:38.446 --> 01:43:41.148 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WITH NO I AS WELL AS

01:43:40.448 --> 01:43:42.249 region:rollup2
WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:43.651 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON AND SO THEY'RE

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:44.952 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS THEY'RE LOOKING

01:43:43.651 --> 01:43:47.288 region:rollup2
AT SUGAR CULT WHICH IS NOT.

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:48.589 region:rollup2
CANOPY FORMING SPECIES LIKE

01:43:47.288 --> 01:43:51.258 region:rollup2
MACRO CISTUS.

01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:51.892 region:rollup2
THAT THE GIANT HELP OR THE BOOK

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:53.727 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:55.629 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S BASICALLY JUST

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:56.897 region:rollup2
LIKE ONE LIKE LONG BLADE BUT

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:58.866 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GROWING IT ON LINES AND

01:43:56.897 --> 01:44:00.367 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENS

01:43:58.866 --> 01:44:02.002 region:rollup2
WITH THE OCEANOGRAPHY IN THE

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:04.071 region:rollup2
AREA WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE WATER

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:05.072 region:rollup2
CHEMISTRY AS WELL AS USES OF THE

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:07.241 region:rollup2
KELP AND TRYING TO SEE IF

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:08.509 region:rollup2
THERE'S. A WAY THAT THEY COULD

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:09.343 region:rollup2
BE GROWING MISC HELP THAT THAT

01:44:08.509 --> 01:44:11.545 region:rollup2
WE COULD BRING IT ON LAND AND

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:13.380 region:rollup2
USED FOR FERTILIZER OR AN ANIMAL

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:14.482 region:rollup2
FEED FOR FOR AGRICULTURE SO.

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:17.184 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO TAKE A

01:44:14.482 --> 01:44:19.153 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC VIEW OF WHAT DESK HELP

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:22.490 region:rollup2
AQUACULTURE I'M IMPACT COULD

01:44:19.153 --> 01:44:23.090 region:rollup2
HAVE SO WE HAVE NOW BEGUN SORT

01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:23.824 region:rollup2
OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SHARING

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.625 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:26.260 region:rollup2
TRYING TO COMPARE DATA SETS

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:27.661 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT SPECIES

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:27.862 region:rollup2
AND SORT OF THE BENEFITS THAT

01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:29.330 region:rollup2
THEY.

01:44:27.862 --> 01:44:31.165 region:rollup2
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT

01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:33.000 region:rollup2
SUBSPECIES AND THEN OF COURSE WE

01:44:31.165 --> 01:44:34.168 region:rollup2
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH I MEAN

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.636 region:rollup2
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING

01:44:34.168 --> 01:44:36.604 region:rollup2
ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS FOR BALK

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:37.671 region:rollup2
HELPS ALL THE WORK THAT I'VE

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:39.840 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING IS ON GIANT CULT IN

01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:40.174 region:rollup2
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.008 region:rollup2
AND.

01:44:40.174 --> 01:44:42.243 region:rollup2
BOOK HELP IS.

01:44:41.008 --> 01:44:43.010 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW KIND OF A DIFFERENT

01:44:42.243 --> 01:44:44.879 region:rollup2
BEAST THAN.

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:46.647 region:rollup2
THAN GIANT KELP BUT YOU KNOW

01:44:44.879 --> 01:44:48.883 region:rollup2
THAT'S I THINK ANOTHER BIG NEXT

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:50.551 region:rollup2
STEP IS TO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:44:48.883 --> 01:44:51.986 region:rollup2
AN ADDED SPECIALLY WITH THE LOSS

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:53.721 region:rollup2
OF OF BOOK HEALTH IS.

ANSWERING SIMILAR SORTS OF

01:44:53.721 --> 01:44:56.757 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS

01:44:54.622 --> 01:44:57.925 region:rollup2

QUESTIONS.

01:45:11.238 --> 01:45:16.877 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:45:14.842 --> 01:45:19.180 region:rollup2
DOZEN GO WITHOUT NOTICE THAT

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:21.081 region:rollup2
FUNDING NEEDED YEAH BUT THE

01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:24.018 region:rollup2
COUPLE POINTS THERE THAT'S.

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:26.053 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

01:45:24.018 --> 01:45:27.655 region:rollup2
UP WITH WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:28.489 region:rollup2
I JUST RAN INTO ONE OF THE

01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:29.790 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES THAT A COMPANY AND I

01:45:28.489 --> 01:45:30.925 region:rollup2
DON'T MEMBER THE COMPANY'S NAME

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:32.827 region:rollup2
BUT THE WEBSITE IS PLANET DOT

01:45:30.925 --> 01:45:35.663 region:rollup2
COM.

01:45:32.827 --> 01:45:37.398 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE PUT INTO ORBIT.

01:45:35.663 --> 01:45:39.133 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF LOWER EARTH ORBIT.

01:45:37.398 --> 01:45:40.501 region:rollup2
POLAR SATELLITES

01:45:39.133 --> 01:45:42.603 region:rollup2
SO AS THE EARTH SPINS UNDERNEATH

01:45:40.501 --> 01:45:45.172 region:rollup2
IT THEY LITERALLY GET.

01:45:42.603 --> 01:45:48.042 region:rollup2
AS AS LIFE BY LINE IMAGE OF THE

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:50.911 region:rollup2
ENTIRE PLANET EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:45:48.042 --> 01:45:52.813 region:rollup2
AND THE DATE IS AVAILABLE THERE.

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:54.315 region:rollup2
AS I UNDERSTAND IT LOOKING TO

01:45:52.813 --> 01:45:54.982 region:rollup2
TALK TO FOLKS WHO INTEREST IN

01:45:54.315 --> 01:45:57.151 region:rollup2
THIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CENTERS

01:45:54.982 --> 01:45:58.185 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL OPTICAL SENSORS NOW

01:45:57.151 --> 01:46:00.054 region:rollup2
WHAT OTHER SENSORS THEY CAN PUT

01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:01.622 region:rollup2
UP. SIDE OF THAT IS A RESOURCE

01:46:00.054 --> 01:46:02.923 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH I JUST

01:46:01.622 --> 01:46:04.158 region:rollup2
LEARNED ABOUT IT BUT WHAT AN

INCREDIBLE.

01:46:04.158 --> 01:46:07.228 region:rollup2
RESOURCE THAT THEY'RE MAKING

01:46:05.626 --> 01:46:09.296 region:rollup2
THAT DATA AVAILABLE.

01:46:07.228 --> 01:46:11.232 region:rollup2
TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO TO USE

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:11.865 region:rollup2
IT IN THIS COULD BE VERY VERY

01:46:11.232 --> 01:46:13.534 region:rollup2
VALLEY WITH IF THEY'RE VERY JUST

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:14.435 region:rollup2
SIT AND.

01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:15.769 region:rollup2
COLLECTING THAT DATA THROUGH THE

01:46:14.435 --> 01:46:17.638 region:rollup2
DATA FROM UNDERSTANDING CLIMATE

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:19.006 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

01:46:17.638 --> 01:46:20.541 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING HERE BUT THAT'S

01:46:19.006 --> 01:46:22.109 region:rollup2
THAT'S QUITE A RESOURCE LOOK AT

01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:24.278 region:rollup2
THE DRONE FOOTAGE AND AND. HOW

WE MONITOR AND MANAGE AND ALL

01:46:24.278 --> 01:46:28.515 region:rollup2
THE IMAGES OF OF KELP BEDS SORT

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.883 region:rollup2
OF FOOD THAT FLUCTUATING AROUND

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:32.186 region:rollup2
THE BECAUSE? THAT'S A REALLY

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:33.854 region:rollup2

THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE I

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:45.966 region:rollup2
THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM.

01:46:43.364 --> 01:46:46.567 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY WE'VE GOT TO RESTORE

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.635 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S THE RIGHT THING

01:46:46.567 --> 01:46:50.537 region:rollup2
TO DO.

01:46:47.635 --> 01:46:53.173 region:rollup2
BUT FOR A LOT OF OTHERS IN

01:46:50.537 --> 01:46:55.175 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT ECONOMIC BENEFIT

01:46:53.173 --> 01:46:57.311 region:rollup2
OF WHY ELSEWHERE RESTORING OF

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:58.879 region:rollup2
COURSE.

01:46:57.311 --> 01:47:00.381 region:rollup2
LOVE THE OYSTERS FROM HOG ISLAND

01:46:58.879 --> 01:47:02.816 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS.

01:47:00.381 --> 01:47:04.318 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S HIGH IN AQUACULTURE

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:04.718 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY SEATS YOU WILL BE

01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:06.921 region:rollup2
AT THE AIRPORT AT.

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:08.789 region:rollup2
.

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:09.957 region:rollup2
SO IT MUST MANY MARINE LAB

01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:11.358 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT UP THERE A

01:47:09.957 --> 01:47:12.559 region:rollup2
BURGEONING. AQUACULTURE PROGRAM

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:14.261 region:rollup2
THERE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:16.730 region:rollup2
FEED INTO THE AQUACULTURE

01:47:14.261 --> 01:47:18.365 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AND AND REALLY GROW THE

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:20.100 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:22.236 region:rollup2
TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:24.338 region:rollup2
IT SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP AND

01:47:22.236 --> 01:47:26.940 region:rollup2
AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY AND HAVING

01:47:24.338 --> 01:47:27.508 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC BASIS FOR THIS WORK

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.509 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:47:27.508 --> 01:47:30.511 region:rollup2
BASIS

THAT STRUCK ME.

01:47:41.956 --> 01:47:45.125 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WITH THE TAMALES BAY.

01:47:43.857 --> 01:47:46.360 region:rollup2
KNOWING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT OF

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:48.595 region:rollup2
COURSE THAT HUMBLE BAY WE'RE

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.229 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE THE FRESH

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:50.364 region:rollup2
WATER FLUSHING THROUGH SERVICES

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:51.765 region:rollup2
GO BACK.

01:47:50.364 --> 01:47:53.934 region:rollup2
EACH OF THOSE HAVE VERY VERY

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:56.170 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT

01:47:53.934 --> 01:47:57.037 region:rollup2
TITLE FLOW CURRENT INTO MOLLIS

01:47:56.170 --> 01:47:58.439 region:rollup2
PAGES SORT OF CATCHES ALL OF

01:47:57.037 --> 01:48:00.507 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:47:58.439 --> 01:48:03.277 region:rollup2
NORTH SOUTH CURRENT.

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:05.512 region:rollup2
ALONG THE COAST AND SO DOESN'T

01:48:03.277 --> 01:48:07.715 region:rollup2
FLUSH THE SAME WAY THAT SOME OF

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:10.451 region:rollup2
THE OTHER BAYS ARE HOW IMPORTANT

01:48:07.715 --> 01:48:12.219 region:rollup2
IS THAT IN.

01:48:10.451 --> 01:48:13.854 region:rollup2
THE INVESTIGATIONS AND AND ARE

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:16.357 region:rollup2
YOU LOOKING AT. THE DIFFERENT

01:48:13.854 --> 01:48:18.559 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE PLACES.

01:48:16.357 --> 01:48:22.029 region:rollup2
OR IS THIS STILL EARLY ENOUGH

01:48:18.559 --> 01:48:22.930 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S.

01:48:22.029 --> 01:48:24.164 region:rollup2
SO IT IS NOT BE LOOKED AT YEAH

01:48:22.930 --> 01:48:25.232 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY SIR THAT IS WAS A

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:26.934 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF THAT

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:29.136 region:rollup2
EXPANSION TO ALL SIX OF THOSE

01:48:26.934 --> 01:48:31.005 region:rollup2
SITES SO WE STARTED IN BODEGA

01:48:29.136 --> 01:48:32.973 region:rollup2
AND SMALLEST BANG A. ORIGINALLY

01:48:31.005 --> 01:48:34.875 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE'VE MOVED STATEWIDE

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:36.777 region:rollup2
IN PART OF IN PART DUE TO THE

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:37.344 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION THAT YOU JUST MADE

01:48:36.777 --> 01:48:39.246 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT EACH OF THESE

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:41.048 region:rollup2
ACTUARIES. REALLY FUNCTION

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:43.083 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY AN EVEN SITES WITH

01:48:41.048 --> 01:48:44.451 region:rollup2
IN ACTUARIES BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY

01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:45.753 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD SAY THE SITES THAT

01:48:44.451 --> 01:48:47.755 region:rollup2
WERE MONITORING WITHIN SMALLEST

01:48:45.753 --> 01:48:48.689 region:rollup2
BAY. IF YOU'RE OUT TOWARDS THE

01:48:47.755 --> 01:48:50.591 region:rollup2
MOUTH THREE YOU'RE GETTING A LOT

01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:52.793 region:rollup2
OF OCEANOGRAPHIC INFLUENCE WE

01:48:50.591 --> 01:48:54.528 region:rollup2
SEE SOME DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND

01:48:52.793 --> 01:48:56.196 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS THAN WE DO IN

01:48:54.528 --> 01:48:57.998 region:rollup2
SEA GRASS MEADOWS THAT ARE MORE

01:48:56.196 --> 01:48:59.933 region:rollup2
IN THE INTERIOR OF THE BAY. AND

01:48:57.998 --> 01:49:02.136 region:rollup2
SO ALONG WITH THOSE.

01:48:59.933 --> 01:49:03.337 region:rollup2
SENSORS FOR OCEAN ACIDIFICATION

01:49:02.136 --> 01:49:05.205 region:rollup2
WE ALSO PUT SENSORS THAT

01:49:03.337 --> 01:49:06.607 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MONITOR THE FLOW OF THE

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:08.275 region:rollup2
WATER THROUGH THE SEA GRASS

01:49:06.607 --> 01:49:09.676 region:rollup2
MEADOW. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:10.744 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:12.913 region:rollup2
DOCTOR NICHOLS WAS BROUGHT UP

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:14.815 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHEN WATER COMES UP

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:16.683 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE SEAGRASS MEADOW IS

01:49:14.815 --> 01:49:18.052 region:rollup2
IT SLOWING AND AS IT MOVES TO

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:19.820 region:rollup2
THE SEA GRASS MEADOW OR IS IT

01:49:18.052 --> 01:49:21.522 region:rollup2
MOVING AROUND THE EDGES. AND ARE

01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:22.790 region:rollup2
THOSE BEHAVIORS DIFFERENT AT

01:49:21.522 --> 01:49:24.558 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SITES WITHIN AN

01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:27.261 region:rollup2
ACTUARY ARE THEY DIFFERENT MORE

01:49:24.558 --> 01:49:29.563 region:rollup2
BROADLY ACROSS THE STATE IN

01:49:27.261 --> 01:49:32.065 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ACTUARIES. AND WE

01:49:29.563 --> 01:49:34.902 region:rollup2
WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER ALL OF THAT

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:36.437 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THOSE ARE SOME BIG

01:49:34.902 --> 01:49:37.704 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:49:36.437 --> 01:49:38.572 region:rollup2
WOULD PROBABLY CAN'T ANSWER IT

01:49:37.704 --> 01:49:39.706 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY BUT YES THAT'S OF

01:49:38.572 --> 01:49:40.641 region:rollup2
THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY WAS

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:42.376 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY TO GET AT SOME OF

01:49:40.641 --> 01:49:44.344 region:rollup2
THOSE DIFFERENCES OKAY OKAY WELL

01:49:42.376 --> 01:49:45.712 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S JUST.

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:47.081 region:rollup2
WHAT LITTLE I KNOW ABOUT SOME OF

01:49:45.712 --> 01:49:47.915 region:rollup2
SAID YES AND I KNOW THAT THEY?

01:49:47.081 --> 01:49:49.850 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DO FUNCTIONAL LITTLE

01:49:47.915 --> 01:49:50.684 region:rollup2
BIT DIFFERENTLY AND THEN.

01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:52.319 region:rollup2
AND DOCTOR YOU ALSO MENTIONED

01:49:50.684 --> 01:49:53.787 region:rollup2
YOU OFFER PUT SEAGRASS.

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:55.589 region:rollup2
WITH OYSTERS. AND IS THAT SAID

01:49:53.787 --> 01:49:56.990 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN.

01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:59.026 region:rollup2
SEE ABOUT THAT THE GROWTH OF THE

01:49:56.990 --> 01:50:00.394 region:rollup2
OYSTERS YET OR OTHER SO WE ARE

01:49:59.026 --> 01:50:02.629 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MONITOR.

01:50:00.394 --> 01:50:04.465 region:rollup2
GROWTH RATE CHANGES WITH THE

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:06.200 region:rollup2
OYSTERS IF THEY'RE INSIDE VERSUS

01:50:04.465 --> 01:50:07.868 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE SEAGRASS MEADOWS

01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:09.169 region:rollup2
AND THOUGHT THAT PROJECT IS

01:50:07.868 --> 01:50:10.471 region:rollup2
BEING LED BY CHRISTY CROKER WHO

01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:12.005 region:rollup2
IS THE COLLEAGUES THAT WE HAVE

01:50:10.471 --> 01:50:13.474 region:rollup2
IN COMMON HERE SO SHE'S ON

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:15.042 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE OF THESE PROJECTS SHE'S

01:50:13.474 --> 01:50:17.644 region:rollup2
AT UC SANTA CRUZ.

01:50:15.042 --> 01:50:20.347 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW PART OF THAT IS

01:50:17.644 --> 01:50:21.248 region:rollup2
AGAIN TO LOOK AT THE. BIOLOGICAL

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:23.617 region:rollup2
SIGNALS.

01:50:21.248 --> 01:50:24.284 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS A DOCTOR STOCK WHICH

01:50:23.617 --> 01:50:25.652 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP EARLIER WE ACTUALLY

01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:26.553 region:rollup2
CAN'T JUST MONITOR THE CHEMISTRY

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:28.422 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:30.023 region:rollup2
BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THOSE

01:50:28.422 --> 01:50:31.525 region:rollup2
THOSE CHEMICAL CHANGES.

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:31.992 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:50:31.525 --> 01:50:34.595 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL.

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:35.729 region:rollup2
.

01:50:34.595 --> 01:50:37.231 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT COULD BE MAN MADE

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:38.699 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF

01:50:37.231 --> 01:50:40.634 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE AND

01:50:38.699 --> 01:50:43.203 region:rollup2
SEAGRASSES TOGETHER WITH IN AN

01:50:40.634 --> 01:50:45.405 region:rollup2
ACTUARY. IF WE KNEW HOW THOSE

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:48.108 region:rollup2
SEAGRASSES WERE IMPACTING.

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:49.576 region:rollup2
ORGANISMS THAT FORMER SHELLS SO.

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:50.911 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE BIGGER

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:52.279 region:rollup2
PICTURE INTERESTS OF THE STATE

01:50:50.911 --> 01:50:53.313 region:rollup2
IF FOR THINKING ABOUT THE

01:50:52.279 --> 01:50:54.848 region:rollup2
INTERESTS OF SUBSTANTIVE

01:50:53.313 --> 01:50:56.750 region:rollup2
AQUACULTURE IT'S ACTUALLY

01:50:54.848 --> 01:50:58.352 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO KNOW. WHETHER OR

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:59.586 region:rollup2
NOT BEING INSIDE OF THE SEA

01:50:58.352 --> 01:51:01.021 region:rollup2
GRASS MEADOW OR ON THE EDGE OF

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:02.656 region:rollup2
THE SEA GRASS MEADOW OR RIGHT

01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:04.525 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THE SEA GRASS MEADOW. IS

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:05.859 region:rollup2
THE OPTIMAL PLACE FROM THE

01:51:04.525 --> 01:51:08.962 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF AN OYSTER.

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:09.963 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:51:08.962 --> 01:51:11.331 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT'S IN AND THAT'S WHY

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:12.266 region:rollup2
ALL THESE COLLABORATIONS I THINK

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:13.667 region:rollup2
A REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF WE CAN

01:51:12.266 --> 01:51:15.235 region:rollup2
TAKE.

01:51:13.667 --> 01:51:17.104 region:rollup2
IN.

01:51:15.235 --> 01:51:18.438 region:rollup2
BUT A PRODUCTIVE USE OF SOME OF

01:51:17.104 --> 01:51:20.674 region:rollup2
THESE SYSTEMS THROUGH

01:51:18.438 --> 01:51:22.476 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE AS WELL

01:51:20.674 --> 01:51:23.243 region:rollup2
AS HELP TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM SO

01:51:22.476 --> 01:51:26.280 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ACTUALLY FUNCTION

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:27.581 region:rollup2
BETTER. AS OUR CLIMATE CHANGES

01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.283 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY PARTY ANSWER ALL

01:51:27.581 --> 01:51:30.884 region:rollup2
THIS STUFF IS TO.

01:51:29.283 --> 01:51:31.518 region:rollup2
MITIGATE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

01:51:30.884 --> 01:51:32.686 region:rollup2
CARBON WITH PUTTING THE

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:34.688 region:rollup2
ATMOSPHERE THAT THAT GETS

01:51:32.686 --> 01:51:36.290 region:rollup2
ABSORBED. BUT WERE.

01:51:34.688 --> 01:51:37.391 region:rollup2
GETTING KIND OF PASS THAT AND WE

01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:38.258 region:rollup2
NOW NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:51:37.391 --> 01:51:40.060 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS AND BE ABLE TO

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:42.396 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT.

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:43.897 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO? AND AND WHAT'S NEXT

01:51:42.396 --> 01:51:44.998 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS ALL VERY

01:51:43.897 --> 01:51:46.833 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONAL AND.

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:49.436 region:rollup2
AND REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:50.571 region:rollup2
SO MOST OF IT.

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:52.339 region:rollup2
WELL ABOVE MY HEAD BUT THANK YOU

01:51:50.571 --> 01:51:55.976 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:51:52.339 --> 01:51:56.810 region:rollup2
BEING HERE PRESENTING AND

01:51:55.976 --> 01:52:00.180 region:rollup2
HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:51:56.810 --> 01:52:01.548 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:03.283 region:rollup2
SO NEXT UP I WOULD TAKE PUBLIC

01:52:01.548 --> 01:52:05.953 region:rollup2
COMMENT IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO

01:52:03.283 --> 01:52:09.923 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE.

01:52:05.953 --> 01:52:11.758 region:rollup2
ON ANY OF THIS.

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:14.127 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT.

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:16.363 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE I'M GOING TO WRAP UP

01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:16.930 region:rollup2
AND TO GO BACK TO WHERE I

01:52:16.363 --> 01:52:19.132 region:rollup2
STARTED WHAT WE DO WHAT'S MY

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:20.434 region:rollup2
NEXT BELT.

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:21.802 region:rollup2
OR ANYBODY HERE. ALTHOUGH

01:52:20.434 --> 01:52:24.004 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT'S WE DO OUR BEST

01:52:21.802 --> 01:52:25.939 region:rollup2
WORK BY TAKING A DEEP BREATH.

01:52:24.004 --> 01:52:27.507 region:rollup2
ALLOWING SCIENCE TO DO ITS WORK

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:29.243 region:rollup2
AND THEN FIGURING OUT WHAT OUR

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:30.477 region:rollup2
NEXT STEPS ARE IN COLLABORATION

01:52:29.243 --> 01:52:31.545 region:rollup2
WITH THE INDUSTRY WITH THE

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:33.914 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WITH THE

01:52:31.545 --> 01:52:35.382 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS WHO ARE OUT THERE.

01:52:33.914 --> 01:52:36.650 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M HOPING WE

01:52:35.382 --> 01:52:38.952 region:rollup2
GET OUT OF THIS IS IS A

01:52:36.650 --> 01:52:40.354 region:rollup2
BEGINNING.

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:41.722 region:rollup2
THERE'S A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

01:52:40.354 --> 01:52:43.624 region:rollup2
OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND THEN

01:52:41.722 --> 01:52:45.325 region:rollup2
AS WE SEEK SOLUTIONS WEATHERS

01:52:43.624 --> 01:52:47.928 region:rollup2
RESTORING KELP BEDS.

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:50.097 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING AQUACULTURE TARGETING

01:52:47.928 --> 01:52:51.965 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS WERE TARGETING

01:52:50.097 --> 01:52:53.600 region:rollup2
RESTORATIONS AND AND THINGS IT

01:52:51.965 --> 01:52:55.168 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS IS WHAT I THINK IS

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:57.437 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY.

01:52:55.168 --> 01:52:58.872 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL SO APPRECIATE YOU ALL

01:52:57.437 --> 01:53:01.508 region:rollup2
BEING HERE TODAY VERY MUCH

01:52:58.872 --> 01:53:03.844 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT THE CONVERSATION

01:53:01.508 --> 01:53:06.079 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE INPUT INTO OUR

01:53:03.844 --> 01:53:07.147 region:rollup2
PROCESSESHERE. THIS I HOPE WILL

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:08.582 region:rollup2
BE BY NOW IT'S GONNA BE AN

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:09.316 region:rollup2
ONGOING CONVERSATION BECAUSE I

01:53:08.582 --> 01:53:11.985 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU'RE ALL WORKING ON AN

01:53:09.316 --> 01:53:13.687 region:rollup2
ONGOING BASIS. BUT IF THERE ARE

01:53:11.985 --> 01:53:15.589 region:rollup2
AND FOR ANYONE WATCHING ANYONE

01:53:13.687 --> 01:53:17.491 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THIS IF THERE ARE

01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:18.759 region:rollup2
BETTER WAYS THAT WE.

01:53:17.491 --> 01:53:20.327 region:rollup2
AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:53:18.759 --> 01:53:22.162 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AS AS GOVERNMENTS

01:53:20.327 --> 01:53:24.264 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD BE

01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:25.766 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES STEPS WE

01:53:24.264 --> 01:53:27.768 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE TAKING HOW WE CAN BE

01:53:25.766 --> 01:53:28.769 region:rollup2
SMARTER. ABOUT BRINGING
