SUFFERING. THE IMPACTS OF THE

THAT'S BEEN RAISED TO ME. IS

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.198
THE APPROPRIATE RECEIVER OF THE

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:08.567
MONEY THE COCS IS IT THE

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:11.570

BEEN FORTHCOMING SO I HAVE

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:30.890
CONCERNS ABOUT CONTINUING TO

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:33.826
FIND. ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.462
NOT BE RESPONSIVE IN IN TERMS

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.897
OF TELLING US WHAT THEY'RE

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:44.437
CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE SEEN.

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:47.907

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:51.077
PRACTICES SO I REALLY

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:52.344
APPRECIATE THE FRAMEWORK I

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.979
THINK IT'S GOING TO GIVE US.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:57.516
SOME OF THE DATA AND- AND IN IN

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.585
UP UP IN ADDITION TO THAT ONE

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:01.720
OF THE THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:03.923
SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR. AREA IS

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:06.725
THAT. IF WE CONTINUE TO FIND

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:09.428
THE COCS THEY ARE A CREATION OF

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.197
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AS

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:14.700
SUCH THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:18.838
HAVE TO ABIDE BY. BUT THE RULES

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.506
THE GOVERNMENT DOES SUCH AS

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:22.708
OPEN MEETING LAWS POSTING THE

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:25.311
AGENDAS CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

00:12:25.377 --> 00:12:27.813
SOME OF THE COCS. ARE MADE UP

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.881
OF MEMBERS WHO RECEIVE THE

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:32.017
MONEY AND MOUNTAINS THAT'S THAT

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.752
WOULD BE PROHIBITED ANY OF OUR

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.387
ENVIRONMENT AND SO. I JUST

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:36.655
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS WE

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:38.290
CONTINU TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:41.093
AND TO SET UP. THE THIS THAT

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.428
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO IT

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.462
THAT WE MAKE SURE THERE'S

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:53.672
TRANSPARENCY. THAT THE

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:57.009
ACCOUNTABILITY AND- AND THE OP

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:57.977
FOR THE TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.178

THOSE ARE THOSE THAT THAT I

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:02.648
HAVE SOME OF WANNA. MAKE SURE

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:05.117
WE- I THINK THAT- AND THEN LAST-

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:08.420
ISSUE IN THIS THIS- THE KEEPER

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:10.656
THE KEY. OUR RESOURCES HAVE

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:13.159
BEEN TERM- THE ABILITY TO

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:16.028
PURCHASE EXISTING INFO ON

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.564
HOTELS AND MOTELS AND THEN USE

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.733
IT TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS IS

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:21.367
REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I WANT TO

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:24.170
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME-

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:29.241
THE ABILITY TO. KEEP THOSE

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.545
UNITS AFFORDABLE THAT THAT IF

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:35.080
THE MONEY DRIES UP SME SOME

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:37.049
SOMETIME ALONG THE LINE WHETHER

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.051
IT'S STATE REVENUES OR LOCAL

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:41.287
GOVERNMENT REVENUES THAT THE

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.155
HOUSING THAT HAS BEEN PURCHASE

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:46.258
STAYS AFFORDABLE AND IN THE

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.760
PUBLIC SPHERE SO THAT WE DON'T

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:49.128
LOSE THE AFFORDABILITY AND THE

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:52.164
ABILITY TO USE THOSE THOSE-

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:54.767
THOSE ARE- UNITS SO THERE HAVE

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:56.168
TO BE COVENANTS THAT PROTECT

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.303
THAT AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:58.804
THAT WE'RE BUILDING IT IN ANY

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:01.974
SYSTEM SO. THAT A LOT OF A LOT

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:02.541
OF ISSUES THERE BUT I THINK

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:04.476
FROM. THAT THE REALLY IMPORTANT

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:06.812
THING IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.981
THE RESOURCES SO WE CAN. WE CAN

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:09.548
GET THE UNITS WE DESPERATELY

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:12.084
NEED. THAT'S IT FOR ME SENATOR

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:15.821
NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:17.389
YOU'RE CERTAINLY DID PROVOKE A

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:19.725
LOT OF INTEREST IN ME WITH YOUR

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.927
REMARKS RIGHT NOW. I'VE DEALT

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.062
WITH THIS ISSUE FOR AN AWFUL

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:25.231
LOT OF YEARS AND I HAVE LIKE

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:27.633
AND HOW CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.034
MANY OTHER STATES AS WELL ABOUT

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:31.737
WITHTHE HOMELESS POPULATION

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:33.606
IT'S LIKE AN ABSTRACT ARTIST.

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:37.142
WE GET A BIG WHITE CREATED WALL.

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:38.844
BRING IN A BUCKET OF PAINT THE

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:41.113
WHAT BRUSHING GOES SPORTFISHING

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.116
IT AGAINST THE WALL. I THINK

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:46.685
THAT'S BEEN FOOLHARDY IN FACT

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:49.088
I'M GOING NOW EVEN FURTHER I

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:51.624
BELIEVE THAT IN TERMS OF OUR

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.692
HOMELESS POPULATION WE SHOULD

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.728
BEGIN ASSESSING THE

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.796
INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS AS WE DO IN

00:14:57.863 --> 00:14:59.898
THE SCHOOL THE I. E. P.

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.533
INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN WHAT

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.801
ARE THE NEEDS OF THAT HOMELESS

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:06.038
POPULATION PROVIDING A SHELTER.

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:07.706
A PLACE TO SLEEP IS NOT

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:10.676
SUFFICIENT. OTHER THAN TO KEEP

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:14.647
THEM IN THAT STATE. I WOULD

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.115
RATHER SEE THEM BE ABLE TO

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:19.752
TRANSITION. INTO A MORE

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:20.686
PERMANENT STATE OF

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:24.323
SURVIVABILITY. AND I DON'T KNOW

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.125
THAT WE'RE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:29.361
ALL THAT SUCCESSFUL IN DOING IT.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:30.663
AND I WOULD GO ALL THE WAY BACK

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.364
TO THE GAME PROGRAM WHICH NOW

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.932
HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS CALLED

PART OF THIS OFFICE IS THAT-

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:58.944
THE CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURY

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:01.647
INVESTS BORROWS AND INTERACTS

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.749
WITH THE PAYMENT SYSTEM. IN

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.384
WAYS THAT MOST OTHER STATE

OBSERVE THAT. I'M DOING THIS

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.926
KIND OF PROGRAM. MORE LIKELY

00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:19.398
THAN NOT WOOD- B. AFTER YOU

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.300

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:26.138
SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:28.273
AND WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.275
EXTEND WELL BEYOND THE NOTION

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:33.545
OF TAX CREDITS AND OR RETOOLING

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.681
OF EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:38.050
THOSE. MADAM CHAIR THAT EXISTED

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:40.719
CAL HFA WHERE- I HAD THE

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.421
PLEASURE OF SERVING WITH YOU ON

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:44.189
THE ON THE BOARD A NUMBER OF

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:46.825
YEARS AGO. THE CONCEPT AS I

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:51.096
UNDERSTAND IT FROM. THE SENATE.

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:56.335
IS TO CREATE A HYBRID OF- THE A

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:58.504
SERVICEMAN'S READJUSTMENT ACT

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.405
OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR COMMONLY

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:02.174
KNOWN AS THE GI BILL WHICH IN

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.109
ADDITION TO. EDUCATIONAL

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.612
BENEFITS ALSO CREATED WHAT WE

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:08.180
NOW KNOW TODAY IS VETERANS

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:11.683
LOANS. SO A VERY INTENSE THAT.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.186
MELDED WITH A PHENOMENON THAT

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:16.421
WE OBSERVE OCCURRED IN THE LATE

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.624
SEVENTIES AND NINETEEN EARLY

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.792
NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN INTEREST

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:22.861
RATES WERE VERY HIGH BACK

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:25.130
FUNDAMENTAL IS KNOWN AS A

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:26.899
SHARED APPRECIATION MORTGAGE.

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:30.202
AND WOULD COUPLE THAT WITH A

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:33.539
PROGRAM OPERATED- PRESENTLY BY-

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:38.010
CAL HSA AND MANY OTHER STATES

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:38.577
IN THE FORM OF DOWN PAYMENT

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:42.347
ASSISTANCE- WE EXPECT THAT- THE

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:43.515
IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH A

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:46.151
PROGRAM WOULD BE HIGHLY LIKELY

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.986
TO REQUIRE THE UNPRECEDENTED

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:51.223
COOPERATION. BETWEEN THE STATE

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.426
AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISES TO

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:56.962
AVOID. EXPOSING CALIFORNIA

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.230
TAXPAYERS TO SOME OF THE

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.566
FINANCIAL RISKS THAT MAY BE

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:01.366
INHERENT WHILE STILL

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:05.370
PRESERVING. THE BENEFITS. TO BE

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:08.907
CLEAR- I AM NOT A MEMBER OF THE

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:11.143
BAR SO I DON'T PRACTICE LAW BUT

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:13.245
I WOULD FULLY EXPECT. THAT

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:15.614
THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE LEGAL

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:17.516
ISSUES THAT WOULD COME BEFORE

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:20.052
THE STATE AND HELPING THIS

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:23.555
PROGRAM- THAT MAY BE BEYOND

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:24.690
STATUTORY MIGHT EVEN BE

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:26.725
CONSTITUTIONAL BUT NEVER THE

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:29.761
LAST. AS I'VE EXPRESSED TO THE

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:32.397
PRO TEM'S OFFICE- AND TO

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:33.932
SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL SENATE

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:37.102
OFFICES. LEAVE THAT THAT IS

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:41.673
NOT- THAT IS NOT A REASON TO-

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.975
SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS I'M

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:45.644
DOABLE BUT RATHER TO JUST BE IT

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:47.879
IT SPEAKS FOR A DEGREE OF

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:49.414
CAUTION AND A HIGH DEGREE OF

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.250
THOUGHT IN A PROCEEDING WITH

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:55.387
THAT. WHAT WE CAN OBSERVE AS

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:56.655
FINANCIAL PEOPLE IN THE

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:58.523
TREASURER'S OFFICE IS THAT THIS

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.160
IS. HIGHLY LIKELY TO PRODUCE

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:06.231
SOME A SIGNIFICANT- IMPROVEMENT

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.534
IN THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING IN OUR

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:12.004
STATE IS. THOUGHTFULLY AND

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.842
CAREFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND- THE

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:17.442
TREASURE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:19.378
WORKING- WORKING WITH OTHER

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:21.913
OFFICIALS IN THE STATE- TO

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.982
STANDING- THE PROGRAM UP AFTER

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:25.417
CAREFUL STUDY THEN I'LL BE

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:27.452
HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOUR

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:31.757
THE- MERCED THE COMMITTEE HAVE.

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:34.259
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SURGERIES-

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.695
AN ISSUE THAT- I HAD SOME

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.630
CONCERN ABOUT- IT'S ALWAYS

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:40.265
HARDER TO STAND UP A NEW

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:42.668
PROGRAM THAN IT IS TO USE ONE

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:47.806
THAT ALREADY EXISTS- ED BAND SO

00:21:47.873 --> 00:21:52.110
I'M I'M MINDFUL OF THE. NEED TO

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:54.246
BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE SETTING

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:57.215
UP BUT A NEW PROGRAM THAT IS

00:21:57.282 --> 00:22:00.252
THAT IS ROLE WILL ENTAIL AN

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:02.821
INVESTMENT A PRIVATE EQUITY OR

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:04.923
PRIVATE CAPITAL IN ORDER TO GET

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.892
IT GOING AND I'M I'M WONDERING-

00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.061
SINCE YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH-

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:11.496
WITH KELLY CHIPPED A AND WE DID

00:22:11.563 --> 00:22:11.997
WE DID SIT ON THE BOARD

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:15.267
TOGETHER AND- AND PART OF THE

00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:17.302
REASON THAT CAL HFA DOES DO A

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:18.537
FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS ROGRAM

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:20.939
WAS BECAUSE OF THE ROBUST

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.974
CONVERSATION OF THE BOARD. IN

00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:25.644
FAVOR OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WHAT

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:27.245
WE KNOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

00:22:27.312 --> 00:22:31.717
THE LOWEST. HOME OWNERSHIP RATE.

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:34.186
SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.520
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT ALL THE

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:37.155
BENEFITTED THE GI BILL WAS LOST

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:40.325
AFTER WORLD WAR TWO AND SO- WE

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:42.761
WE'VE WE'VE GONE BACKWARDS IN

00:22:42.828 --> 00:22:44.529
AND IN THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.598
BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO OWN A HOME

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:47.666
IN THE STATE AND SO ANYTHING WE

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.434
CAN DO. TO CREATE AN

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:51.103
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET

00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:54.473
INTO THEIR OWN- UNIT WHETHER

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:58.009
IT'S A CONDO OR A TOWNHOUSE OR

00:22:58.076 --> 00:23:02.547
AT AN ACTUAL- DETACHED UNIT IS

00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:03.348
REALLY IS REALLY REALLY

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:06.118
IMPORTANT THE COST IS THE

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:07.886
BIGGEST OBSTACLE AND THE INCOME

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:09.755
OF THE PURCHASERS IT IS THE

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.823
BIGGEST OBSTACLE SO THIS. THIS

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.391
CONCEPT IS REALLY A GREAT

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:16.495
CONCEPT BUT COULD YOU TELL ME-

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:18.130
WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:19.564
BETWEEN THE CALLOUS YOU'RE FAYE

00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:20.799
AND WHITE WHY WOULDN'T WE PUT

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.501
THIS ACCOUNT YOUR FAITH IF

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:25.437
THEY'VE GOT A PROGRAM THAT'S

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:28.039
ALREADY. WORKING SHE- WELL I

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:29.241
GUESS I WOULD RESPECT IT THANK

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:30.809
YOU FOR THE QUESTION MADAM

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:34.179
CHAIR I WOULD- I WOULD LIKE TO

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:37.282
ANSWER THOSE IN REVERSE ORDER-

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:41.520
BUT BUT TO FRAME MY RESPONSES

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:43.522
I'D LIKE TO SAY THIS IS NOT.

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.090
THIS IS NOT A PROGRAM THAT THE

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:47.325
STATE TREASURER. SANTA ANA

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:50.428
TERRITORIAL SENSE RATHER HER

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:52.697
DIRECTION TO ME IS PART OF OUR

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:55.400
STAFF IS TO ASSIST WHEREVER

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:56.968
POSSIBLE WITH THE FINANCIAL

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:59.337
ENGINEERING OF IT SO THAT TAKES

00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:01.873
ME TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION AND

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.375
THAT IS CAL HSA. I SEE NO

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:05.010
REASON WHY THIS COULDN'T

00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:07.445
EXISTED CAL H. AT FE I WOULD

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:10.315
OBSERVE. THAT ONE OF THE THINGS

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.484
THAT. SHOULD BE LOOKED AT

00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:14.820
PRETTY CAREFULLY. IS WHETHER OR

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:18.490
NOT THE ASSETS AND RESOURCES OF

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:19.825
CALAIS TO FADE WOULD BE

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:23.161
EXPOSED. TO ANY INCREMENTAL OR

00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:26.131
ADDITIONAL LOST. AS A RESULT OF

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:29.401
THE PROJECT AT THE ENGAGEMENT

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:32.537
OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR- IF THERE

00:24:32.604 --> 00:24:35.841
IS A MECHANISM IN PLACE. TO

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:38.977
FIRE WALL THE PUBLIC ASSETS CAL

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:41.880
HFA THEN I WOULD SEE NO REASON

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:45.116
WHY- YOU KNOW THAT THAT

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:46.818
ALTERNATIVE SHOULDN'T BE

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:49.888
IMAGINE. IF ON THE OTHER HAND

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:54.726
THAT BECOMES. TO RESTRICTIVE TO

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:57.028
CUMBERSOME- AND INSTEAD THE

00:24:57.095 --> 00:24:58.763
INTENT WOULD BE TO CREATE SOME

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.966
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE STATE

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:03.235
ITSELF AND THIS INVESTMENT

00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:07.005
ACTIVITY. IT MAY AGUE AGAINST

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:10.475
HAVING IT TO. UNDER THE AGES OF

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:12.644
HAVE KELLY TO SAY LET ME GIVE

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:14.279
AN EXAMPLE. THAT IS THE BEST

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:16.214
EXAMPLE IMPERFECT AS IT MAY BE

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.749
IT'S THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:20.318
GIVE YOU AND THE COMMITTEE. IN

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:22.520
THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION THERE

00:25:22.587 --> 00:25:24.956
WAS THE DECISION MADE TO-

MAJOR TOBACCO COMPANIES. THIS

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.639
REQUIRED THAT THE STATE

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:44.042
ACTUALLY ESTABLISH. A COMPANY

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:01.960
IMPERFECT IS THAT IT MAY BE

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:05.363
THAT IS- I THINK COULD BE A

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.433
CLUE TO WHAT MAY BE REQUIRED

I WOULD ARGUE THE LEGISLATURE

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:31.803

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.906

WHOLE IDEA OF HOUSING. AND I

THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THE

LACK OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. IS

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.714

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THAT

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:37.388

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:42.994
CAN DEAL WITH. SOME OF THE

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:44.829
ISSUES THAT ARE FACED THAT

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:45.363
