TO TESTIFY ANGST TO TESTIFY IN ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ IS HERE SAUL I'D LIKE TO WAIT JUST A COUPLE MINUTES UNTIL WE GET ONE OTHER PERSON WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. DID I SAY SIMPLY. OKAY THIS IS THE SENATE IS. THE FIVE THE FAMOUS IN HANDSOME IS HE JUST DESCRIBED HIMSELF SENATOR HERTZBERG IS HERE SO WE'LL GET STARTED AS A SUB COMMITTEE. WE ONLY HAVE ONE MATTER BEFORE US TODAY WE HAVE A CA FOURTEEN. THE ONE GOOD SAUCES IS WITH US SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBER HERTZBERG EASY FOURTEEN IS SIMPLY A RESOLUTION THAT ASKS THE VOTERS WHETHER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE THAT ALL WORKERS WHO PERFORM SUPPORT SERVICES AT THE UC ARE FOR THE SAME EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS AS YOU SEE EMPLOYEES BEYOND PROVIDING WORLD CLASS INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH AT ITS CAMPUSES MEDICAL CENTERS THE UC IS THE STATE'S THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN AS AN ANCHOR TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT OPERATES. IN RECENT YEARS UC'S OUTSOURCING ESTIMATED SEVEN THOUSAND TO NINE THOUSAND SUPPORT SERVICE JOBS WHAT THE SAME TIME INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HIGHLY PAID ADMINISTRATORS TO APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THIS RESULTED IN ANNUAL ADMINISTRATE PAYROLL COST INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THIS MATCH IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE UC HAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED IT% WOULD COST TO OFFER OUTSOURCED WORKERS. THE FULL PROTECTION CITY COMPLEMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS ENJOYED BY YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS RELATE TO THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY TO HANDLE I THEIR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES OR AN ANTICIPATED NEEDS ANYWHERE IN THE UC SYSTEM WE TOOK AMENDMENTS AND ASSEMBLY THAN CORPORATION UC'S CURRENT POLICIES FOR USE OF TEMPORARY PER DIEM UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THE ANALYSIS HERE WHICH RAISES AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. WHY THIS APPROACH VIA A CA AS OPPOSED TO THE STATUTORY PROPOSALS MADE INFORMACIÃ³N ARE LARA'S PREVIOUS BILLS. THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE IT'S MONEY. THE PREVIOUS PROPOSALS ADDED COST TO THE EXISTING CONTRACTS THOSE BILLS RAISED WAGES AND BENEFITS WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF UC'S EXISTING CONTRACTS. THE ANALYSIS AND HOPEFULLY WE HAVE. THE WE GIVE THAT TO HIM IN FRONT OF YOU BY MICHAEL GYMNAST OF DIRECTOR OF FINANCE FOR THE LAST REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR CONCLUDES THAT THE ADDITIONAL PAYROLL COSTS IN A CA FOURTEEN. ARE MORE THAN OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN OVERHEAD COSTS IN THE EXISTING CONTRACTS MR GYMNAST STATES WE CONCLUDE THAT YOU SEE CAN ABSORB THE COST OF A CA FOURTEEN WITHIN THE AMOUNTS CURRENTLY BUDGETED FOR EXISTING CONTRACTS. MR GENETIC CONCLUSION IS SUPPORTED BY STATE AUDITOR'S FINDING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT SERVICE CONTRACT WORKERS COULD COST MORE THAN UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES DEPENDING ON WHETHER ONE CONSIDERS ALL COSTS INCLUDING OVERHEAD. SENATORS AC FOURTEEN WILL PROTECT SERVICE WORKERS AT THE UC FROM POLICIES THAT PRODUCE ECONOMIC RACIAL AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION NEITHER THE LEGISLATURE NOR THE GOVERNOR CAN ADDRESS A SYSTEMATIC INEQUITIES THAT OCCUR DUE TO THE UC'S AUTONOMY UNDER ARTICLE NINE OF THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER ARTICLE TO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE THE POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY TO ALLOW VOTERS THE OPPORTUNE TO PROTECT VULNERABLE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE. I SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU ALLOW THE VOTERS TO DECIDE WHETHER LOW INCOME SERVICE WORKERS THAT YOU SEE THOSE WHO CLEAN THE TOILETS MOW THE LAWN SERVE OUR FOOD AND CLEAN THE BED PANS. SHOULD ENJOY THE SAME STANDARDS ENJOYED BY YOU SEEM IS DURING THAT SAME MARK MY WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY. LABOR ONE SECOND LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM BEFORE WE LOSE ONE SO. I'M SECRETARY IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL NUMBER YOUR NUMBER HERE NIELSEN. HERTZBERG HERTZBERG HERE LEYVA LEYVA HERE STERN. OKAY ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CATHERINE WEINBERGER PRESIDENT OF APPS ME THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON A FEW ISSUES RAISED IN MY MANY MEETINGS WITH LEGISLATORS. ON THE ISSUE OF EQUITY. THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT MOST OF THE SEVEN TO NINE THOUSAND OUTSOURCED SERVICE WORKERS WHO CLEAN THE TOILETS CUT THE GRASS COOK THE FOOD. AND TO THE BED PANS. EARN ON AVERAGE THREE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY SIX CENTS LESS PER HOUR THAN UC EMPLOYEES WHO DO THE SAME WORK. THESE WORKERS ARE MOSTLY WOMEN OF COLOR WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE. ON THE ISSUE OF WORTHINESS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. LAST YEAR MOST OF YOU PUT SCA NINE ON LAST YEAR'S BALLOT. THAT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT HELPS HOMEOWNERS INSTALL RAIN WATER CAPTURE SYSTEMS. AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOTHING IN NUCLEAR ABOUT EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS FOR TEN THOUSAND OUTSOURCED LOW WAGE CALIFORNIANS IN THAT SAME CONSTITUTION. ON THE ISSUE OF FLEXIBILITY. AN AMENDMENT WAS TAKEN PROTECTING UC'S CURRENT PER DIEM EMPLOYEE POLICY TO ALLOW FOR ADEQUATE STAFFING FLEXIBILITY AT EVERY MEDICAL CENTER AND ON EVERY CAMPUS. PER DIEM EMPLOYEES ARE SIMILAR TO SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ON THE ISSUE OF COST. AN ANALYSIS DONE ON THE ACA BY MIKE GENEST THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE FOR THE LAST REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. SHOWS THAT WAGE AND BENEFIT PARITY COSTS FOR THESE SERVICE WORKERS IS COMPLETELY COMPLETELY OFFSET BY SAVINGS IN OVERHEAD AND STILL LEAVES THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR ANY OVERHEAD COSTS UC MIGHT INCUR. MR GYMNASTS ANALYSIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE AUDITOR WHO REPORTED THAT OUTSOURCED WORKERS MAY COST MORE THAN YOU SEE EMPLOYEE WORKERS WHEN YOU ACCOUNT FOR VENDOR OVERHEAD. ON THE ISSUE OF THOSE EXISTING OUTSOURCED CONTRACT. THE ACA APPLIES AT THE EXPLORATION OR RENEWAL OF EXISTING CONTRACTS AND SO THIS MEANS THERE IS A PHASE IN PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS. AND THE ACA DOES NOT DICTATE WHO OR HOW MANY WORKERS SHOULD BE HIRED. ON THE ISSUE OF WORKING IT OUT WITH YOU SEE. THE ISSUE OF OUTSOURCED SERVICE WORKERS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FOR OVER A DECADE. BUT THE ONLY THING THAT HAS CHANGED IS THE NUMBER OF OUTSOURCED WORKERS. AND TODAY THE PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS EMPLOYED BY YOU SEE AS SERVICE WORKERS HAS DECLINED BY THIRTY PERCENT. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 30% OF OUTSOURCED WORKERS IN LA AND SAN FRANCISCO ARE NOW AFRICAN AMERICANS. IN CONCLUSION. UNDER ARTICLE NINE OF THE CONSTITUTION NEITHER THE GOVERNOR NOR THE LEGISLATURE HAVE THE POWER TO ENSURE SUPPORT SERVICES WORKERS ARE TREATED EQUALLY. SO I ASK YOU TO CAN TO EXERCISE YOUR ARTICLE TWO POWERS AND PLACE ACA FOURTEEN ON THE BALLOT FOR THE PEOPLE. WHO ELECTED YOU TO DECIDE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS LIVE ORDER STRAUSS AND. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES HERE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS STRONG SUPPORT OF OUR PHILLY WHO'S BRINGING THIS ISSUE FORWARD AFTER WORK ATTEMPTING TO WORK OUT AND FIGHT. FOR THE WORKERS NOT ONLY IN THEIR BARGAINING UNIT BUT OUTSIDE OF THEIR BARGAINING UNIT TO ENSURE THE DISPARITY OPTING TO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WATER RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO. WILL TAKE ONE MORE STEP FORWARD TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF A IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DECIDE ON THIS CRITICAL TOPIC. MISTER ALLISON SIR ARTHUR LIEU HERE JUST ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. LOW ALL RIGHT. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT LET'S LET'S DO THIS I SEE THAT THERE'S QUITE A NUMBER OF FOLKS HERE IN AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU OF TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES TO BE HERE SO IF I COULD JUST ASK ALL THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT TO STAND OR RAISE YOUR HAND SO YOU JUST SORT OF.

ALL RIGHT OF SAYING NO ONE ELSE AND WISHES TEST FIND SUPPORT OPPOSITION BOB GOOD AS THE OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD THINK WE NEED AT LEAST TWO SEATS HERE AT THE TABLE WE'LL HAVE THE ALLOW THREE IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT LIKE TO GO FIRST GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HERE TODAY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO A CA FOURTEEN I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE FROM OUR CAMPUSES IT ORGAN FOR THAT SOME TESTIMONY BUT BEFORE THEY DO SOURCE WILL TAKE A QUICK MOMENT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THECOMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE IN THE EARLIER PRESENTATIONS. I SAY IN GENERAL UNIVERSITY BELIEVES THAT COULD THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CONTRACTING OUT OPPORTUNITIES AS HAS BEEN ALLOWED IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS FOR THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS IS STILL APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY FOR THE VERSA CALIFORNIA TO MANAGE THE ONLY THE HEALTH AFFAIRS THAT OCCUR ON THE CLINICAL SIDE OF THE EQUATION BUT ALSO THE GENERAL CAMPUS. SITUATIONS WE MUST RESPOND TO AS WELL THESE ARE SIX SITUATIONS WHERE WE NEED SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE SHORT TERM DURATION SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT AND SO FORTH OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE. WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUE DISPLACEMENT LET ME JUST MENTION WE DO NOT AGREE WE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE FRANKLY. THAT THERE'S BEEN DISPLACEMENT OCCURRING OF UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES THE DATA HAS SHOWN OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. OVERALL REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE NUMBERS THOSE NUMBERS HAVE GROWN APPROXIMATELY. 10% IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OR THE PARTICULAR SERVICE UNITS AND PATIENT CARE TECHNICAL UNITS WITHIN THE ASKED ME. REPRESENTED GROUPS THOSE NUMBERS HAVE GROWN POSSIBLY 17% OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS SO THE NOTION THAT WERE DISPLACING PLEASE REPLACE IT WITH CONTACTED STAFF IS TO SIMPLY NOT TRUE. REGARDING THE POTENTIAL USE OF PER DIEM WORKERS TO SOLVE THE ISSUES THAT ARE. BROUGHT FORWARD AC FOURTEEN. I WOULD POINT OUT I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE MEDICAL CENTERS CAN EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL WE DO NOT BELIEVE WE AGAIN RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT PRETTY M. OPPORTUNITIES WILL SOLVE. EVEN A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR PROBLEMS AND WE DO NOT HAVE PRETTY EMPLOYEES ON THE NON HEALTH NON CLINICAL SITES SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH. CAMPUS ISSUES AT THE GENERAL CAMPUSES WITH PRETTY AND ISSUES. WITH REGARD TO THE- OPINION THAT WAS RENDERED BY MR GYMNASTS. I WOULD MENTION THAT WE DID NOT. KNOW OR HEAR ABOUT THAT OPINION UNTIL JUST YESTERDAY. I WOULD TELL YOU THAT MISTER JESTER NOT REACH OUT TO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO. ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR FISCAL ESTIMATES AND I'LL TELL YOU AGAIN THAT WE CONTINUE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. THAT THE SAVINGS OR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT MISTER JEFF BELIEVES IS IN. OUR SERVICE CONTRACTS OF VOLUMES ARE GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF AC FOURTEEN. WHAT MR NEST HAS AS UNDERSTAND EXCEPT AGAIN NOT SEEN THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT. FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS THAT OUR CONTRACTS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT SIMPLY WAGE BASED. THOSE INCLUDE. EQUIPMENT TRAINING. SUPPLIES MATERIALS UNIFORMS INSURANCE. WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS THAT GO INTO THE OVERALL COST OF THE CONTRACT. THAT ARE NOT JUST WAGE AND ARE NOT JUST OVERHEAD OR OR PROFIT FRANKLY TO THE VENDOR. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE UNIVERSITY WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE TO COVER AND PAY FOR IN ADDITION TO THE EXTRA. WAGE AND BENEFIT PREMIUMS THAT AC FOURTEEN WOULD BRING. AND THEN LASTLY FOR MY COMMENTARIES MENTION ON THIS QUESTION OF. THE CONSTITUTION CONSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF THIS AND WHETHER OR NOT. A PIECE OF STATUE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT THE UNIVERSITY WAS STRONGLY COUNCIL THAT. ACA IS NOT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH. THE GOAL THAT THE AUTHOR HAS PRESENTED HERE. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST. THREE YEARS OF THE- PREVIOUS LARA BILLS. THOSE BILL SOUGHT TO. AMENDED THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE. PRETTY CLEAR IN ARTICLE I SECTION NINE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THAT THE COW FOR STATE LEGISLATURE CAN PASS LAWS. THAT GOVERN OUR COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS THESE IN PARTICULAR THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS SEES. THE GOVERNMENT ARE CONTRACTING FOR BUSINESSES FOR SERVICES AND SO FORTH PRECISELY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO IF IT WERE TO BE THE CASE THAT PIECE OF STATUTE WERE TO COME FORWARD. THAT WOULD IMPACT THOSE SAME SERVICES BE DISCUSSING A CA WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE OPERATIVE IT AND GOVERN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SO. I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER A FEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THOSE POINTS LATER ON AT THIS POINT LIKE TO TURN OVER TO MY- WITNESSES FOR THEIR COMMENTS IN ASSAM INTO SOME CELLS. THANK YOU MISS MURPHY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M DOCTOR AMY MULLIN I'M AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AT UC DAVIS HEALTH AND I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF THE ACA. AND TO TALK ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THIS BILL WOULD HAVE ON OUR PATIENTS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. UC DAVIS IS A LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER FOR BOTH PEDIATRICS AND ADULTS AND WE ARE THE ONLY LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER ALL THE WAY UP TO THE OREGON BORDER. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS I TAKE CARE OF THE MOST CRITICALLY INJURED CHILDREN AND ADULTS FROM MUCH OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WOULD IMPACT MY ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT CARE. LAST SUNDAY I WORKED AN OVERNIGHT SHIFT IN MY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. I HAVE A NINE YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS HIT BY A CAR WITH A BICYCLE. WE WERE EXPERIENCING DELAYS IN RADIOLOGY. IT TOOK OVER THREE HOURS FOR US TO GET A C. T. SCAN ON THIS CRITICALLY INJURED CHILD. THAT WAS A DELAY IN HIS CARE. BUT ALSO DELAY IN MY ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS IN THE WAITING ROOM AND TO GET HIM UPSTAIRS TO THE TRAUMA SURGERY DEPARTMENT. THAT NIGHT THEY WERE FIVE CHILDREN IN MY WAITING ROOM THAT I COULD NOT GET TO YOU. SO THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF NOT HAVING ADEQUATE STAFFING IN OUR TRAUMA CENTERS HAVE LONG RANGING RIPPLE EFFECTS DELAYS IN LAB DELAYS IN CT SCAN IN RADIOLOGY. RIPPLE DOWN INTO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO PATIENTS ACROSS. CALIFORNIA BUT THEN CAUSE DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO TAKE AMBULANCE TRAFFIC WHICH AFFECTS NEIGHBORING HOSPITALS. CONTRACT WORKERS ARE NEEDED IN A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS TO FILL IN GAPS. WE NEED JANITORIAL STAFF TO TURN OVER BEDS IN ORDER TO GET PATIENTS OUT OF THE WAITING ROOM. HOSPITAL CAN THOSE DELAYS CAN LEAD TO. AMBULANCE DELAYS IT'S ALL CONNECTED AND IT IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITIES WE EXPERIENCE THESE SURGES EVERY YEAR SO EVERY YEAR I WATCH. THE FLU SEASON MARCH ACROSS THE COUNTRY I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO START. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW BAD IT'S GOING TO BE BUT WE KNOW EVERY YEAR DURING FLU SEASON WE WILL EXPERIENCE SEARCHES. DURING THESE TIMES IT'S NOT JUST MY HOSPITAL THAT EXPERIENCES SURGES EVERY HOSPITAL EXPERIENCES THE SEARCHES AND WE'RE ALL STRAPPED. DURING THOSE TIMES IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET PER DIEM STAFF BECAUSE THEY'RE NEEDED AT OTHER HOSPITALS AS WELL. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. HOSPITALS ARE THE BACKBONEOF THE SAFETY NET IN CALIFORNIA THESE ARE YOUR TRAUMA CENTERS THESE ARE YOUR STROKES CENTERS THESE ARE YOUR HEART ATTACKS CENTERS. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS HAVE LESS THAN 6% OF THE BEDS IN CALIFORNIA BUT PROVIDE THE SECOND LARGEST CARE FOR INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT CARE FOR OUR MEDI CAL POPULATION. ECA WOULD AC FOURTEEN WOULD DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE PATIENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR MULLIN SIR. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOE FARRELL AND THE CHIEF OF POLICE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE THIS MORNING IF THE PRIVILEGE AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THIS BILLS IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. THIS MORNING I REPRESENT NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT THE OTHER NINE CHEESE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WHO SERVE OUR CAMPUSES AND OUR OUR MED CENTER. IF YOU DEBATE THIS THIS PUBLIC POLICY WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO CONSIDER. WHAT WE BELIEVE MAY BE SOME ON THE TAG IMPACT OR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS WHERE THE UNIVERSITY SPECIFICALLY ON THE ACADEMIC CAMPUSES MUST OUTSOURCING CONTRACT SHORT TERM ASSIGNMENTS THAT ARE NOT NEEDED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR. I MEAN EVERY EVERY CAMPUSES DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO AUGMENT OUR EXISTING STAFF FOR SPECIAL EVENTS. WE HAVE NEVER DISPLACED ANY OF OUR EXISTING STAFF WE MERRILY MERGE THEM IN WITH OUR SEARCH STAFFING TO BE ABLE TO PROPERLY SECURE EVENTS THAT COME ON DOOR CAMPUSES. ALSO TO THAT WE WERE VERY VERY DEPENDENT UPON TECHNOLOGY WE EMPLOY A LOT OF CAMBER SYSTEMS KEY CARD ACCESS BIRDS YOU CALL BOXES. ALL THE EQUIPMENT. UPDATE AND MAINTAIN BOTH SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. OR COLLEGIATE SPORTS OR SPECIAL EVENTS ARE ESPECIALLY AT THE LARGER CAMPUSES THE UCLA'S IN THE IN THE BARCLAYS DAVIS IS SAME WAY. WE WERE EXTREMELY DEPENDENT ALL ON OUR ABILITY TO HIRE OUTSOURCING SECURITY TO BE ABLE TO DO OUR JOBS TO SECURE THOSE THOSE EVENTS. WE'VE TRIED IN THE PAST TO DO SOME OF THESE JOBS WITHOUT CONTRACTING OUT. IT'S A LARGE HUGE ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE DEMAND ON EXISTING STAFF WE HAVE TO MANDATE OVERTIME. WE HAVE TO CALL PEOPLE IN WE HAVE TO REDUCE VACATIONS AND DAYS OFF TO BE OF THE DO THESE EVENTS ONLY BE COMPLICATED WHEN THE EVENTS FOR OVER WE HAVE VERY MINIMAL STAFF BECAUSE WE'VE USED THEM FULL CAPACITY FOR THE FEW DAYS OF THESE THESE LARGER EVENTS. AT THE VERY END OKAY MY COMES VERY VERY SHORT. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERALL SECURITY OF THESE CAMPUSES. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT IF WERE PROHIBITED OR REDUCED ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTRACT OUT SPECIAL SECURITY STAFF FOR SPECIAL HIGH PROFILE EVENTS. I DON'T THINK THIS WHAT WAS INTENDED OF THIS LEGISLATION WE JUST ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT AS YOU MAKE A DECISION. THANK YOU. OTHERS. MORNING SUN HENSCHEL HERE ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. FRED MADE ON BEHALF OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALLIANCE VENTURE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY YOU SEE IS A SANTA BARBARA IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE- ECONOMY THE CENTRAL COAST REGION WERE OPPOSED. BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL IS SO ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOSPITALS IN OPPOSITION. KELLY BROOKS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS WE JUST KNOW THAT THESE CONTRACTING OUT PROVISIONS WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THE FIVE YOU SEE HOSPITALS ARE NOT TO THE OTHER FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS IN THE STATE. THANK YOU. HOWARD WOLINSKY THE OF CALIFORNIA. COALITION OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION IN OPPOSITION. THE QUESTION ONLY RIGHT. CIRCUMSTANCE WITH A NINE YEAR OLD BOY WORRY THERE WAS A THREE HOUR WAIT BEFORE YOU COULD GET A CT SCAN. HOW WOULD A CA FOURTEEN AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO. LOOKS. THAT NIGHT WE HAD A BACKUP IN RADIOLOGY WE HAD STAFF WHO WANT TO DID NOT COME IN THAT NIGHT TO WORK IN THE RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT IN A CA FOURTEEN WOULD DECREASE OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES ON SURGES LIKE THAT TO COVER THE RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S ALREADY AN ISSUE SO OKAY. I APPRECIATE THE ENTHUSIASM THAT WASN'T MEANT TO BE AN APPLAUSE LINE YEAH SO HERE SO HERE RIGHT HERE IS. WE OPERATE BARELY ABOVE WATER. EVERY DAY SO I WILL SAY YES IT IS HARD EVERY DAY TO PROVIDE CARE THAT IS NEEDED TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO ANYTHING THAT IS DONE THAT DECREASES OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS AND OUR COMMUNITIES IS GONNA BE A NET NEGATIVE. BECAUSE WE'RE BARELY KEEPING UP WITH THE DEMAND CURRENTLY THAT IS MY CONCERN RIGHT. IN OF THIS IS TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN CONSEILS WE PROPOSE I REALIZE WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ANY MEMBERS HERE YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ANY MEMBERS HERE BUT FOR APPROPRIATIONS WANT ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE RAISED IT IS JUST THAT FLEXIBILITY WITHIN. THE UC MED CENTERS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT YOU AGREE TO TAKE. AN AMENDMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR SORT OF AN EXPANDED DEFINITION OF WHEN EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR IS THAT RIGHT YES SO THE ABSOLUTELY SO WE'LL TAKE THAT APPROPRIATIONS. NOW SECTION NINE POINT FIVE CAPITAL A- WILL WILL READ A BONA FIDE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MAY INCLUDE BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO IS THAT CORRECT. ALL RIGHT. OTHER QUESTIONS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE SENATE IS THERE LOW. FAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD OR THIS ACA ARE HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I THINK WE KIND OF SEE A THEME WITH EVERYONE WHO TESTIFIED THIS IS OUR SUPPORT STAFF THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE SURE THAT THE UC CAMPUSES RUN WITHOUT ALL OF YOU WITHOUT ALL OF THE THOUSANDS MORE THAT ARE HERE. THESE CAMPUSES DON'T RUN AND THEY ARE OPEN TO OUR STUDENTS AND FUTURE LEADERS I THINK THE OTHER THING WE SEE IS WHAT ARE WE TELLING STUDENTS AT UC WHEN WE SEE THAT SUPPORT STAFF IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY ARE WE TEACHING THEM THAT THERE IS A SECOND CLASS OF CITIZENS AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS I FULLY SUPPORT ALL OF YOU. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ALL VALUABLE AND WITHOUT YOUTHE UC'S DON'T OPERATE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS THAT WERE EDUCATING KNOW THAT EVERY JOB IS VALUABLE BUT ALL WORK IS VALUED THAT IF EVERYONE THERE IS NOT VALUED WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG IN SOCIETY WE'RE MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE THEY ARE LESS THAN AND THAT'S ON ALL OF US SO SHAME ON US IF WE CAN'T FIX FIX THIS. ITEM. IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HERTZBERG THANK YOU INSTRUMENT THAN EVERYBODY FOR SHOWING UP FROM ALL DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE A SHOWING AND OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I SERVED ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS MANY YEARS AGO AND HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE HISTORY OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BETWEEN LABOR ON THE ONE HAND. AND THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IN THE OTHER MR PELOTA TERMS OF HIS LEADERSHIP. IN THE EARLIER DAYS IN THE LIKE AND SAW. A THAT THIS WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS NOT AS IT IS ISOLATION IT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE THAT. AT THE UNIVERSITY AND HOW WHICH NEGOTIATORS OF TREATED FOLKS HAS NOT BEEN GOOD THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRANSPARENT. AND I DON'T THINK WE'D BE HERE TODAY IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT HISTORY. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK TODAY TO THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT HISTORY. ARMED AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A REASONABLE BASIS OF FRUSTRATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN TERMS OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE LIKE IT'S A BIG DEAL. THAT BEING SAID. ARE YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS AND I ALSO REMEMBER WHEN DON PRADA DISPATCH JOHN BURTON THE FORMER PRO TEM OF THIS HOUSE. TO TRY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS YOU WALK BACK IN FRUSTRATION I'VE SEEN ALL THIS STUFF OVER THE YEARS. AND WATCHED WHAT HAPPENED THE QUESTION IS BEFORE US TODAY IS. DOES THIS RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT DO YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION SWITCH CENTER LABOR. APPROPRIATELY REFERRED TO THAT'S THE QUESTION BEFORE US CERTAINLY I AM SOMEWHAT PERSUADED I CERTAINLY AND I KNOW BUT IT'S NOT A REAL HONEST ANSWER BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN THERE BEFOREWAS CENTER LARA. WITH RESPECT ARTICLE NINE SECTION NINE RESPECT ALL THE VARIOUS PROVISIONS WHICH I PULLED OUT AND READ OF THE PUBLIC CONTRACTING CODE. THAT ARE NOW REQUIRED DO YOU NEED THIS IN THE CONSTITUTION WHAT IS THE BALLOT CAN LOOK LIKE IF THIS IS ON THERE WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THE BALLOT. HOW DOES THAT WORK OUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. MY MESSAGE TODAY I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS TODAY BUT I'M VOTING WITH A VERY STRONG AT THE NATION. GET TO THE TABLE YOU HAVE THE BEST. OF CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS THAT WE'VE EVER HAD WITH RESPECT TO LABOR NEGOTIATIONS BECAME A LABOR MOVE HE WAS SPEAKER. OF THE FOR STATE BLAKE AND I BELIEVE THEY A THAT HE WILL STEP DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH YOU AND NOT. AND NOT. ENGAGE IN THE KIND OF CHALLENGE THAT WE SAW BEFORE WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE NEGOTIATED IF YOU. HAD BUT WE SEEN FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES WHICH INFORMS THIS FRUSTRATION OF WHY YOU FEEL YOU NEED. HEY THAT YOU NEED A RIDE HELLO A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BECAUSE SITUATION IS SO BAD. BUT AS THE ABILITY OF HAD TO THAT MONEY. MORE PRESSURE AT SOME LEVEL BUT I ALSO THINK IT REQUIRES. ALL EVERYBODY TO BE SET AT THE TABLE I DON'T NOT WANT TO SIT AND SAY NOBODY'S TO THE TABLE TO LAUGHTER SESSIONS CLOSED. OUT IN SEPTEMBER THIRTEENTH I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. PERIOD AND I THINK IT'S BEEN FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE USED EVERY BEST EFFORT TO TRY TO GET TO THE TABLE THE CD COULD REACH A RESOLUTION ON THIS STUFF. I KNOW THE ARGUMENT HAS BEEN MADE THAT WELL OKAY. GREAT WE HAVE MISTER PRESIDENT CHAIR AND THAT'LL BE LIMITED CONTRACT DOESN'T PROTECT EVERYBODY GOING FORWARD. OUR ARGUMENT OKAY. BUT I THINK CREATIVE LAWYERS CAN WRITE ALL KINDS OF PROVISIONS IN YOUR- NEGOTIATING DOCUMENTS AND I THINK THAT. IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY SITS TO THE TABLE I WILL. VOTE FOR IT IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PROCESS MOVING HOPEFULLY GETS OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS WE CAN. TAKE IT TO THE FLOOR BUT MY AT MY VERY HOPE IS THAT I WILL NOT COMMIT TO VOTE FOR. FLOOR AND I HOPE THAT. ALL OF THIS THING IS RESOLVED BEFORE THAT TIME. SO THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE CARE ABOUT OUR TAKEN CARE OF. AND THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO GO ON THE BALLOT IN THE FORM OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. THAT IMPACTS SO MANY OTHER ELEMENTS OF OTHER CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE FACE ON THE TAX CODE ON. ALL SORTS OF ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH. AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO. I DO THINK IT BEARS SOME HOMEWORK BUT I ALL I CAN SAY IS. YOU KNOW I DOING IT WITH THE- COULD. BE THOUGHT BANDING AND HOPE THAT EVERYBODY WILL. COME TO THE TABLE. AND THAT THE IT'S CLEAR TO ME FOR COMMUNICATION UNIVERSITY. WITH MISTER PERES THE TABLE. IT WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE AND THE KINDS OF. VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE I HAVE SEEN. FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IT WON'T HAPPEN. THIS TIME ROUND. STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE- WORKING PEOPLE SHOWED UP TODAY AS WELL AS TO. THE AUTHOR FOR. STAND UP FOR PEOPLE TIME AFTER TIME WHO OFTEN DON'T HAVE A VOICE YEAH I WAS I WAS A CALLA. TWO THOUSAND NINE SORRY GOING TO LAW SCHOOL I KNOW. THE SOUTHERNERS THOUGH SHE STANFORD. AGAIN WELL AND I HAVE YOU KNOW THIS FIRST YEAR LAW SCHOOL YEARS SIR TO GET YOUR HEAD DOWN IN THE BOOKS. STRESSING OUT DOING YOUR THING. BUT I REMEMBER THESE PEOPLE IN GREEN SHOWED UP AT THE TOP OF THE HILL RIGHT AT THE TOP OF BANKRUPT THE UNIVERSITY HALL WE'RE ALL STANDING THERE AND I. DON'T HAVE THIS HAPPEN ACTUALLY HARVARD WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN THERE SAME THINGS THE TENT CITY IMMERSION FRONT OF MY DORM ROOM AND- HE'S IN THERE WITH ALL THIS PRIVILEGE. INCREDIBLE EDUCATION. AND THEN YOU YOU WONDER HOW YOUR DORM ROOM THAT CLEANED UP OR WHY THE CAMPUS IS SAFE OR WHY. YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO ABOUT YOUR LIFE WITH YOUR HEAD IN YOUR BOOKS AND YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NOT SEPARATE IS A STUDENT AND YOU'RE NOT ABOVE PEOPLE. AND SO I STOOD ON THE PICKET LINES. AND IT'S AN INTERESTING POSITION TO BE SITTING HERE TODAY NOW TRYING TO PUT THAT LEGAL EDUCATION TO WORK TO TRY TO. RESULT THE SAME PROBLEM WE'VE BEEN HAVING FOR. DECADES IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FRANKLY THEY HAVE TO BE AT THIS MOMENT. I SHARE SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION OF HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE FOR SAN FERNANDO TO IT'S LIKE. ALL THESE FAILED ATTEMPTS OVER THESE PAST FEW YEARS AND ALL THE. THREE IMPASSESREACH THAT WE NOW HAVE TO FORCE IT TO THIS LEVEL BUT. M. IF YOU IF YOU DIDN'T TOLD ME CAN WE- USING THAT SORT OF WONKY YOUR SIDE HELP US THROUGH. JUST MECHANICALLY WHY THIS ROUTE WHY WE'VE GOT TO GO WHAT. WHAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO THAT THAT LARA BILL DIDN'T DO OR WHETHER WEBER BILL SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT. WIDE START LET'S LET'S JUST START THERE WHAT WHY WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO THROUGH EITHER AT THE TABLE OR IN STATUTES THAT THAT NEED THAT MAKES THIS THE RIGHT MECHANICS TO GETTING THAT EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY I GUESS I'D I'D START WITH. YOU AUTHOR MS LIVE ORDER AND THEN. MAYBE A LITTLE I DO WANNA GET ABOUT A GYMNAST LETTER TO I WANT TO AGITATE ON THAT THOSE THE TWO ISSUES I WAS HOPING WE COULD SORT OF. LOOK AT. SO. THE PREFERENCE HERE I'M GONNA HAVE MISLED BIGELOW AT STANFORD LAW EDUCATION. WITH AN UNDERGRAD I ACTUALLY UCLA LOSS OKAY I DON'T WANT IT. YES I DO IS JUST THE DIRECT. I BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE AT CAL THAT MAKE ME FEEL BAD FOR YOU SO I'M SORRY THAT'S RIGHT. AND GO BEARS. THERE'S SO SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE RAISED AND- YOU KNOW. ONE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACA AND THE LAR BILL IS THAT THE ACA ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THE PUBLIC INSTITUTION DIRECTLY AND THE CONCERN THERE. THE LARA BILLS. BY LAW COULD ONLY REGULATE THE ENTITIES THAT DID BUSINESS WITH THE PUBLIC INSTITUTION. BUT I THINK MORE FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT NO ONE CONFLATES PUBLIC POLICY WITH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ON ISSUES AS FUNDAMENTAL AS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T RELEGATE ISSUES OF A QUALITY TO THE VAGARIES OF NEGOTIATIONS AMONG ANY TWO PARTIES. WHETHER IT'S VOTING RIGHTS GENDER PAY EQUITY OR MARRIAGE EQUALITY. ACA FOURTEEN IS PUBLIC POLICY FOR A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. BUT VOTERS SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO ENSHRINE IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THERE'S AN ANSWER QUESTIONS. I THE MECHANICS I GET YOUR YOU'RE GOING AFTER THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS SOME MATTERS OF PRINCIPLE ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE I GET THAT SORT OF POLICY PRINCIPLE. BUT. COULD COULD WE ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THAT I GUESS THE WAY THE IF I UNDERSTAND THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN WE STILL HAVE ROOM FOR SOME STATURE THEIR STATUTORY ROOM PRESERVED HERE AND IN FACT IT WOULD SORT OF COMPELLED THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS. THIS IS THE CONTRACT WORK STATUTORILY GOING FORWARD THAT SORT OF THE INVERSE I GUESS OF WHAT. THE LARA MODEL WOULD HAVE BEEN WHICH IS STATUTES FIRST AND THEN PUSH IT BACK BUT- IS YOUR SENSE THAT. SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND CONCERNS FROM THE UC COULD WE DEAL WITH THAT BY STATUTE FOR SAY THOSE EXTRA ASSISTANCE IN THE RADIOLOGY UNIT OR THE SPECIAL EVENTS CIRCUMSTANCE THAT AT PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL POINTED OUT. IN SORT OF SUBSEQUENT STATUTE I'M READING IN. C. ONE A UNDER THIS SORT OF NOT ARE NOT JUST A BUT SORT OF ALL THE PERMISSIVE. EMERGENT BONAFIDE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES MEANS THAT THESE OTHERS WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT STATUTORILY BUT COULD WE COULD BUT THERE IS PLENTY AYE AYE THINKING WE'VE JUST ADDED TO THOSE EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE WERE ALLOWING FOR EMERGENCIES NOW ESPECIALLY WITH THE MEDICAL CENTER. SO YES IF THERE IS OVER REGENE IDEAS THAT THAT COME UP YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE OVER TIME WE COULD. BED TO GO BACK YOU KNOW AND HAVING WORKED WITH. CENTER LARA ON THAT BILL AS. THERE ARE TWO THINGS I WOULD SAY. ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. RIGHT I CAN THINK OF NOTHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAT BELONGS IN. THE CONSTITUTION. THEN THEN THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED EQUALLY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT HERE AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH WHAT WE KNOW HAS HAPPENED SPECIFICALLY AFRICAN AMERICAN WORKERS AT THE UC. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE IT UP TO CREATE OF LAWYERS I'D RATHER TRUST THE VOTERS IN THE STATE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT. YOU KNOW ARE VERY. LARGE EMPLOYER PUBLIC INSTITUTION TO STAND BY CERTAIN IDEALS SO SOMETIMES WE IN TRYING THINGS IN THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE SO DEEPLY AND THOSE PRINCIPLES. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND I'VE SEEN THINGS GET PUT INTO THE CONSTITUTION I DO BELIEVE THAT DEEPLY ON RAIN WATER CAPTURE. I JACKIE THE BILL BUT YOU NOW WE GOT IT IN THE CONSTITUTION. THAT WAS A TAX EXILE IT WAS A PLEASURE BILL YOU KNOW IN AND THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO IT THAT WAY YOU KNOW I DON'T BELIEVE IT IT'S NOT MY CORE FUNCTION THE OF THE RIGHT TO FISH BUT THAT'S IN OUR CONSTITUTION. IT IS IN MY COURT IF. INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY BY OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY. AND I THINK THAT BELONGS IN THE CONSTITUTION NOT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH CREATIVE LAWYERING AND SO I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE NOW LET'S SET THAT ASIDE THAT'S- YOU KNOW. MY PERSONAL BELIEF I THINK ALL OF OUR BELIEFS TO BE HONEST IT'S WET REPLIES. DO YOU SEE WAS RIGHT ON THE LARA BELL. THE LUCY WAS RIGHT AND COST MORE MONEY. BECAUSE THE WAY WE HAD TO DO THE BUILD CONTRACTORS WOULD JUST RAISE THE PRICE OF THE CONTRACT. WHAT WE KNOW NOW AND WHAT WE KNOW INTUITIVELY BUT WE ACTUALLY NOW IS. THE ACA WON'T COST MORE MONEY I WOULD ASK THE UC FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY PAID FOR A CONTRACT WORKER SALARY HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY FOR OVERHEAD FOR THAT CONTRACTOR. I GUESS IT'S AROUND SIXTY SIX CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR I COULD BE WRONG THEY CAN CORRECT ME BUT I THINK IT'S WELL. I'M SURE WE CAN. FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT I'D SAY IT'S SIXTY SIXTY SIX CENTS I'M JUST GUESSING. WE IT'S NOT WE CAN SLOWLY ESPECIALLY OVER TIME THESE CONTRACTS BRING THAT IN IT HE FOR THE INCREASE IN ACTUAL PEOPLE'S SALARIES AND BENEFITS BEING TREATED EQUALLY. SO I CAN'T IMAGINE NOW HAVING ALREADY YOU KNOW I SUPPORTED LARS BILL AGAIN I JACQUI THAT WHEN AND BELIEVED IN IT BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A PREFERRED BULL. METHOD OF GOING BY CREATING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. ALL BECAUSE NUMBER ONE IT DOESN'T SHINE IT A PRINCIPLE I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE IN AND NUMBER TWO I THINK THE COSTS MAKE MORE SENSE. AT THE CHAIR APPROPRIATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SOMETHING I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. SO LET'S TRY FLIP IT BACK TO. YOU SEE A C. SHAKING YOUR HEAD THERE'S A LOT THE LINE SAYS IN IN THE GYMNAST LETTER THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REFERRED TO UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU SEE CAN PROVIDE ITEMIZE JUSTIFICATION OF ITS NEED FOR ADDITIONAL OVERHEAD FUNDING WE CONCLUDE THAT IT CAN ABSORB THE COST OF A C. FOURTEEN. WITHIN THE AMOUNTS CURRENTLY BUDGETED FOR THESE EXISTING CONTRACTS. WHAT WHAT IS THE MATH IF NOT THAT HOW DO YOU DO YOU REALLY SEE IT AS A YOU SEE IT AS MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AS OUTLINED. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER STERN WE DO BELIEVE IS BORN I SPOKE TO THIS A LITTLE BIT IN MY- DIRECTORY COMMENTS NOTING THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF A SERVICE CONTRACT WHETHER IT BE FOR CUSTODIAL OR- BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS ARE FOOD SERVICE OR WHAT HAVE YOU. THERE'S A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT GO INTO THAT WE'VE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGING THE FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS AS A FUNCTION OF OUR EFFORTS ON PREVIOUS LARA BILLS AND PREVIOUS WEBER BILLS AND BY THE WAY. I'D BE HAPPY TO GO BACK AND SORT THROUGH AND WORK THROUGH THOSE FISCAL EXPENSE OF ANYBODY WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO SHOW THAT WE'VE DONE THE SAME METHODOLOGY FOR FIVE YEARS IT'S BEEN CONTINUALLY SAME. WE'VE DONE THAT FOR THE PURPOSES OF BEING DEFENSIBLE AND BEING CLEAR AND BEING ABLE TO SHOW THE SIMILAR APPROACH FROM YEAR TO YEAR. SO WHAT WE WHAT WE TAKE ISSUE WITH THE CHEN S. METHODOLOGY TO GET WE JUST. BUT WHERE THIS FOR THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS THAT. IT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THERE ARE THINGS OTHER THAN. THE WAGE COMPONENTS AND OUT INTO THE EQUIPMENT TRAINING SUPPLIES SO WHAT TO WHAT YOU IN YOUR MIND LIKE GIVE US A GUESSTIMATE GIVES US RIGHT. WE WERE TO MEET THIS GAP BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT NINE YEAR OLD BOY A WRIST BUT WE ALSO. DON'T THINK THAT TAKING CARE THE NINE YOUR BOY. IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE TO TAKING CARE OF. THOUSANDS OF WORKERS LIKE IT'S RIGHT LIKE WE CAN DO BOTH RIGHT BECAUSE THAT. THAT'S THE GOAL RIGHT IS TAKE CARE OF. ALL THE WHOLE SYSTEM MAKE IT HEALTHY WHAT'S THE GAS WHAT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING. WELL THE GAP IS A HUNDRED SEVEN TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS THE FISCAL WE PUT FORWARD ON THIS BILL. GOING BACK TO THE SOME THE WOMAN STATEMENT ABOUT. THE PERCENTAGE OF THE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERHEAD OR OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL PROFITS SO TO SPEAK. I WOULD ATTEST THAT THAT FIGURES ON TYPICALLY 10% OR LESS. OF A CONTRACT VALUE SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT OF CONTRACTED MILLION DOLLARS. YOU'RE LOOKING AT 60% OF THAT. BUT WERE THERE ABOUTS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH LABOR COSTS THE AMOUNT OF THE VENDOR. PAYS THEIR- EMPLOYEES TO PERFORM THAT WORK ON THE ON BEHALF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. A 10% OR SO LOWER LESS. OVERHEAD CHARGE TO THE VENDOR THE BALANCE THE 30% IS THAT AMOUNT I WAS DESCRIBED EARLIER THIS THIS A- CRUDE BY VIRTUE OF. TRAINING ED SHEERAN'S. PERSON REQUIREMENTS. AND SO FORTH. VICE TRAINING EQUIPMENT AND THE AND THOSE PARDON MY LACK OF. LACK OF EXPERTISE IN HIS THAT'S NOT CONSIDERED OVERHEAD. RIGHT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S WOULD YOU WOULD YOU CATEGORIZE THOSE KINDS OF EXPENSES WHEN I'M SORRY WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT. OVERHEAD CENTER TALKING ABOUT THE COST THAT THE VENDOR HAS TO PERFORM THE CONTRACT MEANS TOWARDS THAT OF THE FORTY PERCENT. NON LABOR IN YOUR RIGHT. BUT THE BUT THE 10% OVERHEAD OR OR PROFIT IS THE CHARGE THE THEY RECEIVE. FOR ACTUALLY BRING IN EMPLOYEES AND PROVIDING THEM TO UNIVERSITY THAT'S THAT'S THE COST WE PAY FOR THAT. THE BALANCE ARE THINGS THAT WE THE 30% OR THE THINGS THAT WE FACTOR INTO THOSE CONTRACTS. TO ENSURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DOESN'T PAY FOR THE EQUIPMENT THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF CONTRACT OUT FOR SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT WE DON'T HAVE TO. PURCHASE AND MAINTAIN. EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT WHETHER IT'S FOR. TREE TRIMMING PURPOSES. WASHING WINDOWS OR WHATNOT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE DON'T USE ON A DAILY BASIS AND SO THEREFORE WE SHOULD PURCHASE THEM IN. AND MAINTAIN THEM. BUT EDITION SUPPLIES WOULD BE CLEANING SUPPLIES OR OTHERWISE. PRUNING SHEARS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. OR THE OTHER OF THE BALLOTS. HOSE THINGS WILL CONTINUE THE UNIVERSITY WILL CONTINUE THESE SPEND MONEY ON THOSE. IF THEY'RE NOT CONTAINED IN THE CONTRACT VALUE. SO MY POINT IS AGAIN REGARDING THE GYMNAST. OPINION IS THAT THOSE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BORNE BY THE UNIVERSITY. IN ADDITION TO. THE WAGE COMPONENT. AND THE BENEFIT COMPONENT THAT WILL NEED TO EMPLOY WE'VE NOT WOULD NOT. HIDDEN BEHIND THIS AT ALL WE'VE NOT BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT THIS. FOLKS WHO ARE ON UNIVERSITY PAYROLL UNIVERSITY PLEASE MAKE MORE THAN CONTACTED STAFF. IT IS THE CASE THAT PRESENT APARTADO ESTABLISHED A FAIR WAGE FOR WORK MINIMUM WAGE PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO. TO ENSURE THAT CONTACT STAFF ALL STAFF FOR THAT MATTER BUT CERTAINLY CONTACT STAFF. WOULD EARN MORE. THAN MINIMUM WAGE FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BUT THE AMOUNT THE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES EARN IS MORE THAN THAT SO THAT'S THE WAY EACH COMPONENT IT'S ABOUT A USING FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW. IN ADDITION ON THE BENEFITS AGAIN TO THE EXTENT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE VERY DEFENSIBLE AND VERY CONSERVATIVE. WE'VE BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER ABOUT IT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT OF 30% INFLATOR ON BENEFITS MAKE MY COLLEAGUES HERE FROM THE CAMPUS WILL TELL YOU THAT. BENEFITS USUALLY ABOUT AT LEAST 40% OR MORE OF THE OVERALL VALUE OF A OF A WAGE. WE EVEN AT 30% FOR THE SAKE OF NOT. APPEARING TO BE JACQUI NUMBERS OF INFLATING SO IT'S THOSE TWO COMPONENTS THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE ON TOP OF THAT'S WHAT IT THE QUAIDS TO THE ONCE EVERY TWO POINT SIX. AND THOSE BE ON TOP OF THOSE OTHER. ELEMENTS OF THE CONTRACT WE BE BEHOLDEN TO PAY. AND IF I COULD. GO AHEAD I JUST SO I'M SORRY SO IT'S ONCE A TWO POINT SIX IN YOUR MIND OR TO. IT'S EVEN MORE THAN THAT IT'S ONE THIRTY TWO POINT SIX PLUS. IT'S ONE THIRTY TWO POINT SIX PLUS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WERE TAPPED TO BRING THOSE. SERVICES IN HOUSE WE MAY HAVE TO. PROVIDE FOR THE EQUIPMENT CELLS MAY HAVE TO PURCHASE SO WHAT IS WHAT IS THAT IN IN YOUR- THAT NUMBER WE'VE NOT QUANTIFIED. AND THAT'S HOW WE'VE OF THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. I MEAN GIVE ANY SENSE HERE. PRUNING SHEARS IT SAID I THINK I THINK YOU'RE CERTAINLY SYSTEM WIDE INTO THE LOW MILLIONS BUT- IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO PUT ADDITIONAL NUMBER ON THAT SO WHEN YOU. GET BEFORE A FLOOR VOTE IS THAT CERTAINLY. BECAUSE I MEAN IN MY MIND YOU GOT THE APPROPRIATIONS CHAIR HERE AS THE AUTHOR. IF THERE'S A DELTA TO MEET TO MAKE THIS THE TO SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL THEN THAT SEEMS LIKE. AT LEAST WORTH DOING SOME MATH AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT WOULD ENTAIL END. AND I GUESS. YEAH I MEAN THE REAL QUESTION I HAVE IS ARE THESE. THESE X. X. THE STATUTORY EXCEPTIONS THOUGH. AS THESE ACTIONS LIKE DOES THAT COVER THE SCOPE OF WORK THAT THAT YOUR CONCERNED YOU WON'T LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY EVEN PERMIT US ROOM TO STILL GO TO THE SPECIAL EVENT WORK AND THE LANDSCAPING WORK. WITHIN THE CONTEXT THE BILL THAT WE HAVE SET TO SEEK IT IN LAW. BUT IT IS YOUR MATH DRIVEN BY AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE WOULDN'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE EXCEPTIONS. YOU SEE I'M SAYING YEAH OUR OUR VIEW IS THAT THOSE EXEMPTIONS IF ALL FIVE WERE TO BE APPROVED AS THEY'RE WRITTEN ON THE PAGE TODAY THAT THOSE WOULD ACCOUNT TO PROVIDE FOR PERHAPS MAYBE FIVE PERCENT. OF THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF CONTRACTING OUT ACTIVITIES OCCUR IN A GIVEN YEAR AND SO WHILE THE EXEMPTIONS ARE ARE SOME FLEXIBILITY THE PROBLEM IS THE OTHER 95% IS THE OTHER. SELECT PROHIBITION YEAH LIKE WHAT OTHER STUFF WELL THERE'S ALL THE VARIETY OF ISSUES TAKE PLACE IN THE HOSPITAL AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY DRIVEN BY AN EMERGENCY. I THINK THE DOCTOR WAS TESTIFYING THAT THERE'S CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WHERE PATIENT ACUITY PATIENTS SEVERITY FLUCTUATES AND MAYBE WANT TO JUMP IN HERE BUT IT SAYS WHICH MAY INCLUDE ENSURING THE CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE TO ADDRESS LIFE THREATENING SITUATIONS DURING AN EMERGENCY. COMMA FOR NO LONGER THE ACTUAL DURATION OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE EAT IT IT SEEMS TO. AT LEAST ONE ADDRESS CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT- WHAT'S THE- BUT THE ISSUE I THINK THE QUESTION IS AN EMERGENCY IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM SITUATION BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO WITH THE WITH THE CHAIR SUGGEST SORRY I THINK WE WOULD ARGUE THAT EMERGENCY ROOM SITUATION OR EVEN A GENERAL HOSTILE SITUATION UP. EMERGENCIES. IT'S EVERYDAY'S NOT EMERGENCY EVERY DAY IS JUST THE STANDARD. ROUTINE IT'S REQUIRED IN HOSPITAL TO CARE FOR PATIENTS YOU WOULDN'T BE IN OTHER WORDS NIMBLE ENOUGH TO SEARCH THEY COULD YOU WOULDN'T BE THEY ANTICIPATE THE EMERGENCY SO EVEN IF YOU ADDED A THORNY IN SOME SENSE TO DO IT YOU COULDN'T. THIS EXEMPTION AS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL AT THIS POINT DOESN'T PROVIDE THE LIMITS DOESN'T BY THE- APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY TO CONDUCT THE DAILY AFFAIRS THAT. REQUIRED IN A HOSPITAL OR ON THE CAMPUS. CAN I JUST BEFORE I WRAP UP AND THANK YOU FOR ALL FOR THE INDULGENCE HERE BUT JUST FROM. ADDRESS ME OR THE AUTHOR'S PERSPECTIVE. HOW DO YOU WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF SAY THAT EMERGENCY ROOM LOOK LIKE TO YOU. UNDER THIS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT. REGIME ACTIVELY WALK ME THROUGH THAT SAME KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCE OR HAVE LIKE HOW IT IS ORGANIZED SORT OF CONTEXT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT BETTER BECAUSE I GUESS IT'S NOT EVEN WORKING RIGHT NOW SO IT'S NOT IS IT YES WELL THAT I THINK THAT'S A THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE DOCTOR SAID THAT I DISAGREE WITH BUT THAT'S UNDER THE CURRENT REGIME WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHERE THEY HAVE CONTRACTED WORKERS WHERE THEY HAVE FLEXIBILITY WHERE THEY UTILIZE CONTRACT WORKERS SO STAFFING ISSUES WILL ALWAYS BE AN ISSUE WHETHER THOSE ARE CONTRACTED STAFF OR EMPLOYEES OF THE UNIVERSITY I THINK THAT'S CLEAR. WHEN YOU BRING UP A CASE THAT IS CURRENTLY PROBLEMATIC I MEAN UNLESS SHE'S ARE AND I DIDN'T HEAR THIS UNLESS SHE'S ARGUING THAT IN FACT WE CONTRACT OUT MORE WORK THAT WOULD DEFEAT I THINK THE UC'S KIND OF POSITION AND ANY ASSURANCES WE HAVE FOR THE FUTURE AND PERHAPS IT DOES HIGHLIGHT. HI THIS HAS TO BE. IN TRYING TO THE CONSTITUTION AND WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE THESE TYPES OF PRESSURES NOT JUST THAT YOU SEE BUT ANY HOSPITAL. IN DEALING WITH STAFF TEEN. AS APPROPRIATE STAFFING LEVELS IS SOMETHING WE DEAL WITH IT HOSPITALS I MEAN WE DO A LOT BILLS ON THAT SO OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN ISSUE. I DON'T THINK THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CONTRACTED OUT ISSUE I THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT THE CHAIR HAS. OFFERED UP AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE PROVIDES MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY FOR. FOR HOSPITALS YOU KNOW IN IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE MAY NEED. MORE AT CONTRACT BUT I'M NOT IT I FEEL LIKE WHERE WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS GOING ON ONE WHICH WE ALWAYS NEED TO ADDRESS DOES YOU SEE ME MORE MONEY YES I THINK WE DEAL WITH THIS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IS THAT DIFFERENT THAN HOW THEY'RE USING THAT MONEY. AND HOW WE'RE TREATING. WORKERS AND PEOPLE WHETHER THEY WORK FOR THE UNIVERSITY VERSUS A CONTRACTOR. THERE LEYVA ONSTAR CENTERS RIGHT MY FINAL POINT WOULD JUST BE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAN WE'VE BEEN STARVING THE YOU SEE FOR TOO LONG. AND THAT'S FOR STUDENTS PROFESSORS WORKERS IS THE GRACE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE WORLD AND I'M- I'M. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE THIS SYSTEM ADDED STARTING TO ATROPHY AND FALL APART ON THE CAPITAL SIDE PERSONNEL STUDENTS YOU KNOW THE FIFTY PRESSURES OUT THERE SO. I'M I'M I'M SUPPORTING THE MEASURE. AND I WANT TO SEE SOME MORE INFORMATION BEFORE THE FLOOR I REALLY I HOPE WE CAN GET SOME SOME BETTER MATH AND REALLY KEEP US INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THE FINANCIAL COMMITMENT UNDERLYING THIS VOTE IS I GUESS. RIGHT IF WE'RE GONNA GO ALL THE WAY WITH ISN'T GOING TO CONSTITUTION WHAT ARE WE OBLIGATING OURSELVES TO AND HOW DO WE GET REAL ABOUT THAT IS A LEGISLATURE SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA STEP UP AND DO OUR PART WE'RE PUSH YOU DO YOU DO YOUR PART AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TO ME I MEAN IF I CAN GO IN THIS EYES WIDE OPEN. ON THAT MATH IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT VOTE THEN. THEN JUST ON YOU KNOW A COMPLETE YOUR YOUR COMPETING YEAH YOUR COMPETING SUPPOSITION ABOUT WHAT'S UNDERLYING GYMNAST AND WE NEED SOMETHING MORE TO GO ON HERE WE KNOW THAT IT IS JUST CAME TO YOU SO YOU CAN TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO THE HOMEWORK BUT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL ANY OTHER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HOMEWORK ON THIS AND- YEAH THERE LEYVA. THE CHAIR OF THE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE ARE STARVING THE UC'S WE COULD PROBABLY GIVE THEM MORE MONEY BUT I THINK IT'S THE WAY THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY THAT IS SOMETIMES OF THE ISSUE I JUST WANT TO REINFORCE WHAT THE AUTHOR SAID IN TRYING THIS IN THE CONSTITUTION IS A STATEMENT OF OUR BELIEFS AND OUR VALUES I THINK THAT IS ONE ISSUE BUT I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE IS AS SOMEONE WHO NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T DO THE RIGHT THING TO FORCE THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING THE UC HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND FOR WHATEVER REASON HAS CHOSEN NOT TO AT THE BARGAINING TABLE WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT THE COSTS AND WHATNOT NOT ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT I BARGAINED WITH FOR ALL THOSE YEARS EVER WENT OUT OF BUSINESS THEY ONLY INCREASE THEIR PROFITS ARE ONLY MAKING MORE AND MORE MONEY BUT EVERY TIME WE NEGOTIATE IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY IT'S NEVER ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHEN ARE WE GOING TO MAKE IT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE ABOUT THE WORKERS WHO ARE TRYING TO FEED THEIR FAMILY. THE WORKERS WHO WOULD LOVE MAYBE SOMEBODY FOR THEIR CHILD TO GET TO GO TO THIS INSTITUTION IT'S HIGH TIME THAT WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND IN TRYING IN THE CONSTITUTION IT'S JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE HERE AND ON THE SENATE FLOOR BUT I WILL LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. READY ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA. IT JUST TOOK A COUPLE OTHER. COMMENTS AND CONCERNS. ALL OF US HERE ARE PROUD OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD IN MY FAMILY I HAVE ONE CHILD TO GRADUATE MUCIUS BE TO THE GRADUATED FROM BERKELEY LAW I GRADUATED FROM UCLA LÃ  MISS. IS MR WOLINSKY IS HEARD ME SAY BEFORE THAT UP MY HEART IS UCLA MY MONEY'S BEEN AT UC BERKELEY. SO. SO BUT ALTHOUGH WE'RE ALL PROUD AND THIS IS A AS SIMILAR STERN POINTS OUT SOMETHING THAT IS. AN EXAMPLE FOR LEASE THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE COMPETING INTERESTS WE HAVE COMPETING RESPONSIBILITIES WE RESPONSIBILITIES STUDENTS TO COME THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA MAKE SURE THEY GET A FIRST CLASS EDUCATION. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR EMPLOYEES WERE AN EMPLOYER AND THEN RESPONSIBLY NOT JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET SORTED TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR BUT TO BE AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHERS. AS A RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER. WE HAVE A WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PATIENTS AS YOU POINT OUT DOCTOR THAT WE RESPONSIBILITY THE PATIENTS THAT COME THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOR TREATMENT. WE RESPONSIBILITY TAXPAYERS AND BALANCING ALL THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES SOMETIMES IS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES CREATES TENSIONS. THIS IS AN EFFORT TO ADJUST THAT BALANCE OF I THINK IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS I APPRECIATE YOU ACCEPTING THE MOMENT WE PROPOSE. I THINK IS GOING TO BE OTHER WORK THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE ON THIS ACA BEFORE IT. ULTIMATELY COMES OF THE FLOOR THE SENATE I HAVE A HISTORY IN THIS AREA ALTHOUGH I'M ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. I ACTUALLY WORKED ON THIS ISSUE WITH YOU SEE I WHEN THE GROUNDS KEEPERS ARE ABOUT TO GO ON STRIKE BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES AND WITH CHANCELLOR PELT ISN'T SOME YOU MAY REMEMBER PRESENT HELPS AND IT WAS A CHANCE FOR THE TIME. WE WORKED OUT A COMPROMISE THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE AT LEAST FOR THE- OF FOR THE NEXT DECADE. SO I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS I THINK THAT THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT MEASURE BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS IT IS REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS. SO WITHOUT FURTHER DISCUSSION FOOD RATIONS CENTER LEYVA MOVES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IN A DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE MADAM SECRETARY. I'M SORRY OF. THE LOOMING IT'S ALSO IT'S LIKE CLOSE THAT'S OKAY I'LL BE BRIEF I ALSO A UCLA LAW GRADUATE I HAD MY DAUGHTER AT UCLA MEDICAL CENTER AND I THINK THE AFFINITY WE HAVE FOR YOU SEE. ALL OF US IN THIS BODY IT IS CLEAR. I ALSO HAVE AN AFFINITY FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK WE CAN'T. LOVE YOU SEE SO MUCH THAT WE SUGGEST THAT THEY'RE EXEMPT FROM OUR PRINCIPLES OF BASIC DIGNITY AND EQUALITY. SO WITH THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IN THIS I'M SURE WILL BE AN ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT OVERHEAD AND TRAINING AND- AS AS THE CONTRACTS DECREASE THEY RUN OUT BECAUSE WE IT'LL- TAKE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IN AND PEOPLE ARE IN SOURCED IF YOU WILL THOSE COSTS GO DOWN AND WE KNOW THAT IN SO. A LOT OF COST RIGHT NOW ARE DUPLICATIVE. TRAINING HAPPENS WHETHER YOU'RE. EMPLOYEE OR OR YOU'RE NOT THERE'S OFTEN SAVINGS AND SCALE. LONG TERM ACQUIRING THE TYPE OF. THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO YOUR JOB WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OUTSOURCE RADIOLOGY TAX THEY BRING IN THEIR OWN MRI. HEY WE STILL HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT SO A LOT OF THIS BECOMES A LESSER OF A COST IN OVERHEAD AND I THINK WHAT WE FOUND FROM THE AUDITOR FROM THE FORMER TO. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DIRECTOR IS THAT IN FACT MAYBE WE HAVEN'T BEEN SO HONEST ABOUT THE COST OF OUTSOURCING AND THAT THIS MEASURE COULD ACTUALLY HELP US HELP YOU SEE SAVE SOME MONEY. AND SO WITH THAT I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU ON THIS AS A MALE HOPEFULLY MOVES TO PREPARATIONS AND TO THE FLOOR. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MA'AM SECTOR.
