AND MISS QUICKSILVER YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYBODY. TIME HAPPY TO PRESENT TODAY AB EIGHT ZERO NINE AND AS I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT PRIORITY LEGISLATION BEFORE. THIS PARTICULAR. LEGISLATION WOULD FOCUS ON MEMBERS AND FORMER MEMBERS OF THE U. S.. ARMED FORCES AND STATE MILITARY RESERVE IN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION UP FOR PRIORITY REGISTRATION REGARDING NURSING PROGRAMS LIKE IN MY DISTRICT AONE CYPRESS COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH IS NOW RANKED AS THE. NUMBER ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT THEY HAVE A NURSERY NURSING PROGRAM. THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED. WHICH IN MANY WAYS. IS A TESTAMENT TO PEOPLE WANTING TO GET INTO THIS TYPE OF PROFESSION BUT BECAUSE OF IT BEING IMPACTED WE HAVE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS THEN GOING. TO OTHER PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHICH ARE ALSO VERY WELL ATTENDED BUT AS FAR IS OUR VETERANS WE KNOW THAT THEIR SERVICE IN THE MILITARY HAS NOT ONLY. ALLOWED THEM TO ALREADY EXPERIENCE AND TO PERFORM SOME OF THE NURSING DUTIES AYE THAT MANY OF OUR. YOUNG CANDIDATES ARE LEARNING ON THE U. S. B.. BUREAU OF LABOR STATS PROJECTS THAT THE EMPLOYMENT OF REGISTERED NURSES WILL GROW FROM NINETEEN PERCENT BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO COMPARED WITH ONLY ELEVEN PERCENT FOR OCCUPATIONS OVER ALL. AND AMERICA IN AMERICA THERE ARE MILLIONS OF VETERANS WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN THE. U. S. ARMED FORCES THAT POSSESS MILITARY OCCUPATION SERVICE TRAINING. MEDICS AND CORPSE MEN WHO'VE SERVED IN THE MILITARY ARE A CUSTOM AND WELL SUITED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE IN DIVERSE SETTINGS MANY HAVE RENDERED EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT ON THE BATTLEFIELD. SERVED AS SURGICAL TECHNICIANS IN THE OPERATING ROOM FILLED PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE PHARMACY OR INDEPENDENTLY PERFORM PATIENT CARE AT REMOTELY LOCATED. DUTY STATIONS WHERE NO OTHER HEALTH CARE. PROFESSIONALS EXIST BY ALLOWING PRIORITY REGISTRATION IN NURSING PROGRAMS FOR THIS POPULATION CALIFORNIA COULD CAPITALIZE ON THE PRIOR EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS POSSESSED BY SOME VETERAN MILITARY PERSON NOW. AND SIGNIFICANTLY AND SIGNIFICANT GONNA LAY REDUCE THAT CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUING NURSING SHORTAGE WHICH.

DR WEB THAT AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS AFTERNOON I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE THE BILL RELATING TO THE STRUCTURE OF SALARIES FOR C. ISSUE EMPLOYEES. EVIDENCE STRONGLY SUGGESTS THE C. ISSUE IS THE ONLY CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCY THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE SALLY STEPS TO ADD STAFF. THIS CREATES AN INVERSION IN SAUDI SQUARED NEW HIRES ARE EARNING MORE THAN MORE EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES. FOLLOWING THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX IMPASSE IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS MISSY ISSUE BOARD OF TRUSTEES UNILATERALLY ELIMINATED EXISTING EMPLOYEE SALARIES STEPS. INCREASES TIED TO JOB PERFORMANCE AND LONGEVITY. THIS IS RESULTED IN NEW HIRES EARNING HIGHER SALARIES THAN EXISTING EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE WORKED IN THE SAME CLASSIFICATION FOR MANY YEARS. THIS INEQUITY HAS CREATED A NINETEEN NINE A NINETY FIVE. NINETY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN VERSION GAP BETWEEN THE SAUDIS OF NEWLY HIRED AND LONG EMPLOYED AND LONG EMPLOYED SEE ISSUE STE. STAFF. FOR TWO DECADES THE C. ISSUE HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO REINSTATE SALARY STEPS DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE EXISTING SAU STRUCTURE AND THE INABILITY OF EMPLOYEES TO EARN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAIT. AB THIRTEEN TWELVE THIRTY ONE WILLIE REINSTATE THE FIVE PERCENT SAUDI STICKS FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SUPPORT STAFF. THE INCREASE WILL BE MADE ANNUALLY ONE EMPLOYEE MEETS THE STANDARDS WAS SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE AS DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYEES ADMINISTRATIVE. HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE IS TERRY WILSON WHO WORKS AT FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY AND PETE BLOUSE FROM TO SEE ISSUE SAN MARCOS. HI MY NAME IS PETE ROUND OF WORK ETHIC AT CAL STATE SAN MARCUS FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS. AND DESPITE PROMISES MADE FROM THE CSU THAT I WOULD MOVE THROUGH THE SALARY RANGE OF MY POSITION. AND EVEN THOUGH I'VE RECEIVED POSITIVE JOB EVALUATIONS MY SALARY IS STAGNANT. NEW EMPLOYEES ARE HIRED AT A GREATER SALARY THAN MINE. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE HIRED TO DO THE SAME WORK THIS INEQUITY IS BECAUSE BY A CSU SALARY STRUCTURE THAT IS CLEARLY BROKEN. WE NEED TO RETURN TO THE TIME WHEN CSU STAFF RECEIVED OUR STEPS LIKE EVERY OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES OUR STATE AGENCY RATHER. I AM I AM ASKING FOR PARITY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES I'M ASKING TO BE FAIRLY COMPENSATED AND I'M ASKING TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. AFTER THE CSU ELIMINATES OUR STEPS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE TRIED TO REINSTATE STEP. BUT CS YOU REFUSED. AS A RESULT OUR SALARIES BECAME UNEQUAL AND MANY EMPLOYEES ARE LEAVING THE CSU FOR JOBS WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. IRONICALLY CSU ADMINISTRATORS RECEIVE FIVE PERCENT ANNUAL SORRY INCREASES ON A REGULAR BASIS. BUT NOT SUPPORTS THE. WHILE EMPLOYEE SALARIES REMAINED STAGNANT AND THE CS YOU CLAIMS POVERTY. THE CSU PROFITED BY INCREASING THE ACCOUNTS IT HOLDS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE TREASURY BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WHICH GENERATES HUNDREDS OF MILLION DOLLARS EXCUSE ME HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INTEREST. THE CSU PROFITED BY NOT PUTTING AN EQUITABLE SALARIES AND NOW IT'S TIME TO FILL THE CSU ACCOUNTABLE BY COMPLYING WITH THE SAME PRACTICES ALL OTHER STATE AGENCIES. I'M NOT APPRECIATED IF YOU'D SUPPORT AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE. THANK YOU. CHAIR MEDINA MEMBERS. THANK YOU AND HAPPY NEW YEAR. MY NAME'S TERRY WILSON A NUMBER TEN YOUR EMPLOYEE AT FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY. AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE RE INSTATE SALARY STEPS THAT WERE UNILATERALLY TAKEN AWAY BY THE CSU ADMINISTRATION TWENTY YEARS AGO. FOR TWENTY YEARS THE CITY HAS YOUR HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO REINSTATE SALARY STEPS DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE EXISTING SALARY STRUCTURE. AND THE INABILITY OF EMPLOYEES TO EARN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAGE. ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS PARITY. WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES. I WAS FIRST HIRED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND AS ADMINISTRATIVE ANALYST SPECIALIST AT FRESNO STATE. I WORKED IN THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT I OVERSAW STAFF AND THE BUDGET. I WAS PROMOTED TO THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICE. WHICH REQUIRED INCREASE STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES. AND MORE OVERSIGHT. AND BUDGET RESPONSIBILITIES. I NOW RUN THE BULLDOG ID CARD AND IMAGING DEPARTMENT AT FRESNO STATE WE EMPLOY THIRTEEN EMPLOYEES WORKING DIRECTLY UNDER ME. I ALSO PRIDE ASSISTANCE TO THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE UNIVERSITY CONTROLLER. DESPITE THESE CHANGES IN MY JOB RESPONSIBILITIES AND WORKLOAD. AND DESPITE CONSISTENTLY RECEIVING OUTSTANDING. EVALUATIONS FOR MY PERFORMANCE. MY BASE SALARY HAS NOT INCREASED IN TEN YEARS. AS I WORK THE FRESNO STATE. ADDING FURTHER INSULT NEW EMPLOYEES ARE BEING HIRED. IN THE SAME JOB CLASSIFICATION THAT I WORK IN. AND EARNING A HIGHER SALARY THAN I. THIS IS YOUR ADMINISTRATION HAS ADMITTED THAT THE EXISTING STAFF SALARY STRUCTURE IS BROKEN. IN FACT IT WOULD TAKE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THE SAME HIGH SALARIES TO LONG TERM EMPLOYEES. THAT ALREADY BEEN GIVEN TO NEW HIRES. I HAVE REMAINED STAGNANT IN MY JOB. AND SEE IF YOU ADMINISTRATORS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE NNUAL SALARY INCREASES. EVEN WHEN THEY AREN'T EVALUATED FOR THEIR JOBS. AND THIS WAS A FACT PROVEN AND CONFIRMED IN LAST YEAR'S. AUDIT BY THE STATE REVIEWING CSU SALARY PRACTICES. THE AUDIT ALSO FOUND THAT CSU MANAGEMENT POSITIONS GREW AT OVER TWICE THE RATE OF SUPPORT STAFF. WITH HALF A BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TOTAL COMPENSATION. THAT FAR OUTPACE THE SALARY. INCREASES OF OUR SUPPORT STAFF. AGAIN WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR HERE IS PARITY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. AND THEIR EMPLOYEES. AYE SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZED FOR WORKING AT THE CSU. NOR SHOULD NEW EMPLOYEES BE HIRED FOR THE SAME JOB CLASSIFICATION BE GIVEN A HIGHER SALARY. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE THIRTY ONE THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. KIMBERLY ROSENBERGER WAS SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION WHERE PROUD TO JOIN AS A CO SPONSOR WE THINK THAT THIS IS A LONG AWAITED AND JUST FIX THINK YOU. BRIAN HOW WITH CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF OF THE TWENTY THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR SUPPORT. TIM CAMERA BEHALF OF SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT. PAT GAP PRESIDENT SEE ISSUE EMPLOYEES UNION THIRTY SEVEN YEARS CAL STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO AND FULL SUPPORT. MARK MCKINNEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION A STRONG SUPPORT. CAPTAIN HUTCHINSON BODY TECHNICIAN IT'S ISSUE TEN ISLANDS IN SUPPORT. THE CHEMICAL OUT PLOY AT CSU FULLERTON I BEEN WITH THIS ISSUE FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS STRONG SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON AGILE MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. BOBBY RAHAL WE ARE OPPOSED THE MEASURE. I WE'RE POSE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT PROCESS. AND WHILE I WAS NOT EMPLOYEES. OF THE CSU NINETEEN NINETY SIX ARE. I DO BELIEVE. HISTORICALLY THE WAY THIS PARTICULAR POT OF MONEY WAS FUNDED. WAS BY ALLOTMENT FROM THE STATE. THAT HAD TO GO AWAY DURING THE BUDGET CRISIS. DURING THE NINETIES. AT THAT POINT. I WAS CHOSEN UNITS. THAT MADE THE DECISION TO ASK WOULD ASK TRADING HOUSES TO RESCIND THAT ACTION. WE ARE COURSE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS TO BE REINVESTMENT IN OUR EMPLOYEES. I THINK THAT IS MERITED IN THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY TEN PERCENT SALARY CREASE FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND THEN AGAIN WE JUST SUPPORTED EIGHTY NINE PERCENT SELLER CREASE. LITTLE GOLF ACT OF SEVENTEEN THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY NOW BEYOND. ABOUT A FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IT COST% THE SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT AVERELL SUPPLY THAT TO SEE IF A AS WELL AFFECT ASSOCIATION. SO WE AGREE WITH THE DESIRE TO ENSURE THE STRINGS THESE APPOINTEES ARE COMPENSATED APPROPRIATELY. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF THIS BILL HAVE. GOING FORWARD ONGOING WITHOUT ANY SORT INVEST FOR THE STATE TO OFFSET THAT. STRUCTURE. NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE GUY ON THE PHONE THAT WAS REFERRED TO THAT COULD BE TAPPED INTO. PER STATE LAW. THOSE FUNDS IN THE REVENUE THAT ARE COLLECTED NO ARE REQUIRED TO BE USE FOR COUPLE FACILITY USES. ONE TIME. SO THERE THE AS THE LAW AS LET'S ADDRESS FOR AS. STARTED THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THOSE FUNDS AND HOW MAY BE USED FOR SOME W. MUST BE OPPOSED. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR WENT. THANK YOU. MR MEDINA AND I I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT PARITY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND. AND ALSO THE FACT THAT LONGTIME EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY EARNING LESS THAN. NEW EMPLOYEES AT THE SAME RANGE SO LIKE I SAID I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THAT I AM CONCERNED WITH PUTTING THIS INTO STATUE AND PUTTING THE AMOUNT INTO STATUTE TO. I THINK THESE. THE SORT OF DECISION SHOULD BE MADE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE AND. BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. A DECADE TO GET THAT DONE AND. AND THAT CERTAINLY MAKES THAT MAKES THINGS MUCH MORE. DIFFICULT AND AND I THINK THAT DOES. REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO TO MAKE THAT STEP SELF. A AGAIN WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THAT WE NEED TO BE WARY ABOUT THE. LOSS OF BUDGET FLEXIBILITY IN A DOWNTURN. THIS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M. JUST AT. TRY TO UNDERSTAND IF I RECALL IN THE FALL THERE'D BEEN AN AGREEMENT FOR AYE NINE PERCENT PAY INCREASE OVER THREE YEARS FIVE REMEMBER THAT QUICKLY. DOES THAT COVER DIFFERENT. EMPLOYEES ARE CLASSIFICATIONS THIS ON TOP OF THAT NINE PERCENT PAY INCREASE IF THIS PASSES WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT PAY INCREASE THAT I THINK WAS PART OF COLOR THE BARGAINING NEGOTIATIONS AND THE S.. STEPPING INCREASES ARE DIFFERENT THAN AND THEN MOVE THEN RAISES IS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASES STEPPING CREASES TALK ABOUT HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THE INSTITUTION EXIST. THE PEOPLE ENTER AT A CERTAIN LEVEL IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THEY MOVE UP THE LADDER WITH BEEN THEIR CLASSIFICATION WHEN YOU GET A PAY INCREASE IT GOES ACROSS THE BOARD. AND SO EVERYBODY GETS THAT SO THIS WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET BUT A STEP INCREASE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW YOU PROGRESS IN THE FIELD AND IN THE AREA WHERE YOU ARE. WITHOUT A STEP INCREASE EVERYTHING JUST THIS KIND OF FLOAT AROUND IN NEGOTIATING AMONG INDIVIDUALS VERSUS UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU MOVE UP THE LADDER. AND EVERY OTHER STATE AGENCY HAS THAT LATTER THAT'S DEVELOPED IN THE STRUCTURE SO THAT WHEN WE IF THEY IF THEY'RE AT STEP ONE THEY GO TO THE GO TO THREE. AND IF THE AGENCY OR THE STATE COMES AND GIVES A FIVE PERCENT RAISE ECHOES ACROSS THE BOARD BUT THE STEPS REMAIN. IN PLACE AND SO IT REALLY IS ABOUT HOW YOU DEVELOP A CAREER PATTERN OR LATTER TO A TOAST AS PEOPLE WORK IN A FIELD AVAIL JUST REMAIN IN THE SAME SALARY. AND THEN GET EVERYBODY GETS IT INCREASE ITS TALK ABOUT BASICALLY A STEP IN THE PROFESSION AND MOVING UP WITHIN THE CATEGORY WHICH RIGS YOU EXIST. WE HAVE THAT SYSTEM FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND THEN IT WOULD AWAY A WE HAVE PUT IN STACKS WHO NOW FOR THE FACULTY TO HAVE STEP INCREASES AGAIN A BECAUSE THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY WHEN I WAS THERE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. OF THE MORALE ISSUE IS VERY LOW WHEN IT COMES TO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE STRUCTURE OF THE INSTITUTION HOW YOU MOVE IN AND HOW YOU MOVE UP WITH AND CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE A RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU AND SO BASICALLY THEY'RE CHEERING STEPPING COLUMNS AND EXACTLY OKAY. AND SO THIS IS ESSENTIALLY ON TOP OF A NINE PERCENT PAY INCREASE THE BABY HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED. THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING EXACTLY. I HAVE THAT'S HELPFUL NOW I I SHARE THE CONCERNS ARE GOOD COLLEAGUE. FOR VENTURA HAS. BASICALLY MY NAME IN COMMITTEE. MEMBER IRWIN IT'S LED ME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION BECAUSE I JUST FIND IT IS SO RIGID AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT REGIONALLY MANDATING. SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH CS YOU I I HOPE THAT THERE CAN BE A PERSON I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ALTERNATIVE ALLOWS NINE MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT. THIS TO BE PART OF THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE LAST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS LEAST THE WHEN THE FALL. SHOWED THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCREASES. AND THAT WHEN. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE ARE. SUCCESSFULLY OBTAINED THROUGH THAT VERY PROCESS. BUT THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT FOR ME PRITCHETT. EMBASSY WHO. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS BILL I DID I THOUGHT OKAY I WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A RAISE LIKE THINGS ARE GOOD WE SHOULD BE GIVING RAISES. AND THEN I SAW THAT THE LAST TIME THIS BILL CAME UP I VOTED NO. AND I THOUGHT WELL WHY ON EARTH WOULD I HAVE VOTED NO AND I I LOOKED AT THE BILL LITTLE THAT MORE CLOSELY. AND. NO I SEE. FIRST SO THAT YOU DIDN'T GO SHE'D AN INCREASE. UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. AND SO THAT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS WORKED. YOU WILL GET MORE MONEY YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BE GETTING A SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR BONUS. WHICH AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON IT'S NEVER ENOUGH. I DON'T SEE THAT A NEGATIVE WAY WE GO TO WORK BECAUSE WE WANT TO FEEL PURPOSE IN THE WORK THAT WE DO. WE ALSO APPRECIATE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE AND WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE MONEY FOR NEXT YEAR SO WE CAN PROVIDE FOR MORE SO WE CAN BETTER OURSELVES AND OUR LIVES. AND SO. WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO INCREASE THE PAY THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING. AND AND AND OF COURSE TO PAY PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY FOR THE VALUE OF THEIR PROVIDING OF SIX PARTICULARLY IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN IN THE CITY. SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK AYE AYE FUNDAMENTALLY IN THE LAST TIME THAT I VOTED NO HAD A PROBLEM WITH. SIDESTEPPING THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS ONE THAT HAS WORKED EFFECTIVELY FOR YOU. AND ALSO. A LACK OF. UNDERSTANDING THE REPERCUSSIONS YOUR INTERESTS AND I COMPLETELY RESPECT. YOUR INTERESTS ARE TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP. AND AND TO PROFESSIONAL EYES THE WORK THAT YOUR MEMBERSHIP DOES. BUT. BUT WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGING WITH YOUR BARGAINING PARTNER. THE TRUSTEES HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL FISCAL HEALTH OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. AND OF A GREAT DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY. THAT THE CSU FACE. IF WE WERE TO GO AHEAD AND AY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH I WANT TO GIVE YOU MORE AND AND I DO LIKE ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. FOUNDED WE WOULD BE DOING THAT. AT A TIME WHEN THE LEGISLATURE AND YOU KNOW MOST YEARS DOES NOT INVEST ENOUGH IN OUR SYSTEMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE FOR YEARS NOT EVEN PROVIDED ENOUGH SEATS FOR STUDENTS THAT QUALIFY. TO GO TO A CSU OR ANY OF THE OTHER SYSTEMS. AND I IN AN AIR OF UNCERTAINTY WHERE WE HAVE AN ECONOMY. WHERE WE'VE GOT A STOCK MARKET ON STEROIDS AND FEDERAL FISCAL POLICY IS GOING TO POP? AND THE STATE'S BUDGET. NEVER SURVIVES THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. INELEGANT WAY IT'S WERE THICK AND THE CUTS ARE AWFUL IT'S SO NOT ONLY DO WE THEN. INCREASE FEES ON STUDENTS WE CUT. THE JOBS AVAILABLE TO YOUR MEMBERS WE CUT NUMBER OF INSTRUCTORS ON CAMPUSES. IN WE CUT A LOT OF OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT'S DIRE AND SO. WE ARE AT THIS. DANGEROUS PEAK. FOR OUR STATE BUDGET. THAT I CAN SEE OVER THE OTHER SIDE. AND IT GOES DOWN IT DOESN'T KEEP GOING UP. AND. AND AND THAT IS WHAT. WILL. STOP ME AS IT DID LAST TIME FROM VOTING YES ON THIS AGAIN AS AS MUCH AS I PERSONALLY. BELIEVE IN BETTERING THE SITUATION OF YOUR MEMBERS AND AND GIVING OUT MORE MONEY. WE WE ARE NOT IN A PLACE OUTSIDE AS MUCH AS WE THINK THAT WE ARE. TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS LONG TERM THAT THAT WE CAN SUSTAIN THE TYPE OF INCREASE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND AGAIN COMPLETELY RESPECT THE BILL THE AUTHOR AND WHAT YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO DO. AND I'M SORRY THAT I CANNOT SUPPORT TODAY. MR JOBS. A VERY MUCH I YOU HAD SPENT A LOT TIME LOOKING AT THIS. IN. MY PREVIOUS LIFE. OF. THERE STEP PROCESS IS FOLLOWED IN THE. AND THE DEPARTMENT IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALL THE TIME. PEOPLE COME AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. AND THE MILITARY GOOD. DOD THEIR. GS LEVELS THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE. AND YOU HAVE STEPS WITHIN THEM INSTEAD FOR DESIGN. AS A RECOGNITION. BUT THE THAT'S WHERE TO SET A PERSON HAS AT A CERTAIN JOBS OF A JOB IS RATED. AND IT YEAR SEVEN OR EIGHT. THIS STEP RECOGNIZES LONGEVITY THEIR. SO THE QUESTION THE AUTHOR IS. I BELIEVE IN DOD THE STEPS ARE. TWO OR THREE YEARS YOU HAVE TO BE IN A JOB BEFORE YOU REACH OTHER STEP WHAT YOU'RE ENVISIONING OF THIS. IS THAT EVERYYEAR TO YEAR EVERY THREE YEAR. THAT YOU'D GO FOR THE STEP. YOU'RE IN HERE JUST STEP INCREASES BASED ON MERIT ANY VALUATION RIGHT BUT WHEN WOULD THAT COME FORWARD. BUT PART. A A MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S THE ANNUAL IT USED TO BE ANNUAL. THAT WAS ANNUAL INCREASES AND THAT THAT WAS WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THEIR ANNUAL INCREASES BUT THEY'RE BASED STRICTLY UPON MERIT. THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE POSITIVE EVALUATION GOOD EVALUATION TO MOVE TO THE NEXT STEP PROVINCE WE GET TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW AND THEN AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO. DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY TO VOTE TOOK TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF ANOTHER NET ALLOW THEM POSSIBLE LETTER WHEN SHE REACHED THE TOP. BUT. BUT IT'S SIMILAR TO THE FITS GIVE OFFENSE RIVER TWO YEARS THE STATE DOES IT EVERY YEAR OKAY IT'S EVERY YEAR BASED ON MERIT IN A REQUIRES AN EVALUATION BY OTHER. BY THEIR SENIOR TO GIVE THEM A FAVOR VALUATION THAT PLACE UP MIA AND THAT'S A STEP IN NOW. AS FAR AS I HAVE A LETTER HERE THE SAME ONE THAT THE. DID YOU MENTIONED EARLIER AS FAR AS A NINE PERCENT OVER THREE YEARS WAS TWO PERCENT A YEAR WHOM THE. QUESTION DIRECTLY MORE TO YOU SIR. IS. PUTTING THE NINE PERCENT BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING NEGOTIATED WITH DEALS WITH. BUDGET AND ECONOMICS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WORKED ENTERED INTO THIS WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM THE STEP. IS THIS TO ME IS A. AND HR MANAGEMENT POSITION THAT YOU HIRE PEOPLE COMING NEXT FOR TEACHER. IMPROVEMENTS SO REWARD THEM FOR THEIR EXPERIENCE AFTER A TRIAL VALUATION. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT NOW. I THINK IT IS STRICTLY FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDIVIDUAL RECOGNIZING THEIR EXPERTISE IT'S BASED ON WHAT THE FUNDING IS RIGHT IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO YEAR. THAT TO YOU YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE SUPPORTING WHAT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER ABOUT THE ECONOMY. WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM RECOGNIZING HOW DO YOU DEVELOP A WORKFORCE TO WELL PROVIDE THE EXPERTISE THAT'S REQUIRED IN IN RUNNING THE. DNC TWO SHIFTS WALL AGAIN THIS IS THIS HAS AS MUCH OF ANALYSIS AND BY THOSE THE PROPONENTS IS BEEN IN THE PLACE FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS NOW THIS. IS THAT WHAT THE PROCEDURE IS. IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS. DESIRED AS PART OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS THE CLUTTERED MARKET PROCESS IF A STEP IS THE WAY TO GO THAT I THINK. FRANKLY THAT'S SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED OUT THE TABLE AND SHOULD BE. TAKEN AWAY. SHOULD BE PART THE GIVE AND TAKE IS PARTLY GESTATION PROCESS. AND WHEN WE DO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR A MERIT STEP INCREASE SPEED PRIDE IN THE BUDGET WE DO PROVIDE THAT YOU'RE HERE. BUT A FORMULA BE SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT PER SE WE DON'T HAVE ALLOTMENT. IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO YEAR. BUT YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE. PAY. THE DIM NEGOTIATE THREE PERCENT A YEAR IS FOR THREE YEARS NOW ABSENT. THAT'S RIGHT LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF THE INSTITUTION IN ITS ENTIRETY. STEP. IS DESIGNED TO LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERTISE AND THE JOB TO DO AND IT'S MORE OF AN H. R.. SYSTEM TO. SO THAT PEOPLE PRODUCE BETTER DATE THESE SEE AN UPWARD MOBILITY THEY LEARN NEW SKILLS TO DO BETTER THAT'S DIFFERENT AND PAIN PEOPLE DON THE ECONOMY IT'S LOOK AT. HOW DO YOU MANAGE YOUR WORKFORCE SO ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THE CEO S. SYSTEM? THE WAY YOU MANAGE A REWARD YOUR WORKFORCE HISTORICALLY. ON THE PERCENT INCREASE NOT ON THE OF VALUATION AND PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IS THAT WE ARE TELLING ME. I THINK THAT THE THE SALARY CHRIS THEY WOODS RECEIVED BY THE GROUP IS ALSO THERE AS AMERICA'S. THERE'S A VALUATION OF AS WELL SO THREE PERCENT. IS NOT I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE. I'M. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU CANNOT GET OUT TO GO THIS WAY TONIGHT. I'VE LET THE PUBLIC KNOW I WENT OUT OF MY WAY TODAY WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS TO CONTACT THE PRESIDENT. OF. THE STATE COLLEGE IN MY AREA. WOULDN'T. DON'T GET A RESPONSE BUT I GOT THIS LETTER AND I READ THE LETTER AND IT DEALS WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT I'M LOOKING AT MORE OF THE. HR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF A. OF A STATE EMPLOYEE WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM. THE INCREASE ON THE ECONOMY THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. HAVING WORKED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT FOR THIRTY YEARS. IF WHAT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT I'M GOING TO. LANE MORE SUPPORTIVE YOUR BILL TO GET OUT THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDING THOUGH THAT I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO RESEARCHERS AND RESERVE THE RIGHT. ON THE FLORIDA POP TO GO THE OTHER WAY BUT. I'M OF CONCERN THAT. WE HAVE LEADERS IN THIS STATE. THAT DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMODITY THEY HAVE IS A WORKFORCE. AND THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A FAIR AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THEIR UP PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND STEP HAS BEEN DOING THAT. ARE IN THE FEDERAL AND STATE INSTITUTIONS EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS THING SO I GUESS I WOULD STEP BACK AND SAY. THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PAY FOR MORE OF. THE OPERATIONS OUT OF OUR BASE BUDGET. WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO MORE WITH WHAT WE GET FROM THE STATE. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CSU AND REVENUE THAT SUPPORTS THE INSTITUTION. IT IS GOING TO BE FOR. STUDENTS AND FROM THE GENERAL FUND THERE IS NO OTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING AVAILABLE. AND SO WE HAVE FROZEN R. FEES FOR OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS WE JUST DID INCREASE LAST YEAR. WE HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT MEANS FROM THE FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN FROM THE GOVERNOR TO INCREASE THEY AUGMENTATION BUT THAT'S JUST. THAT'S JUST BARELY KEEPING UP WITH WHAT REFLATION THIS SO ANY INCREASE IN SALARY COMPENSATION. NEEDS TO REVIVE IT AS PART OF THAT BASE FOR THE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET. ARE HAS THE APPROPRIATE BASED ON A STUDENT ASSESSMENT ON HE'S. THERE IS NO OTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING AVAILABLE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ARGUMENT ALSO BUT. I WOULD GO BACK TO SAY HAVING RAN ORGANIZATION LIKE THIS MYSELF. WHEN YOU INVESTING YOUR PEOPLE AND RECOGNIZE OUR PERFORMANCE STEP YOU OFTEN FIND. THE SAME WORKERS ARE GONNA FIND SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCIES AND HOW TO RUN YOUR ORGANIZATION. NOW IT FOUR YEARS AGO WE REQUESTED. THAT THE C. ISSUES. CONDUCT AND ACTIVITY BASED COSTING TO LOOK AND SEE HOW THEY CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT AS AN INSTITUTION. AND THESE EXACT PEOPLE WHO WHO DO WE ARE TRAINED TO DO THIS WOULD BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU HOW TO FIND EFFICIENCY. TO ME THAT WOULD BE A BETTER ARGUMENT THAN FIGURING THAT WE'RE GOING TO JUST TAKE IT SO MUCH MONEY IT'S GOING TO PACK THE STUDENTS FOR. TO ME THAT'S A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT THIS IS MORE OF AN HR ISSUE. SO AS I SAID EARLIER IF. YOU KNOW WE GOT SOMETIME BEFORE IT'S GONNA BE ON THE FLOOR BUT AS A. SOMEBODY IS WHERE THE SYSTEM. AND HONORED STANDING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STEP IN HR RELATIONSHIPS AND UNDERSTANDING MAKING BUDGETS THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. OKAY THEY DO COME ALIVE BUT THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND THAT AND AND THAT'S WHY. KAREN HANGS A PRESIDENT CAL STATE SAN MARCOS IN THE HIVE IN THE HIVE WHITE ALL THESE GUYS GETPAID THE BIG BUCKS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK. SO AS I SAID I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. HE GOT REPUBLICANS BOY NAY ON THIS THING ABOUT THAT. BUT I'M GOING TO ALSO. WAIT UNTIL ICE YOU COME ACROSS THE FLOOR. IF I HAVE SO MANY CAN GET TO MUNICH SPYING TO ME. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FOR STATE AND HAVE SOMEBODY WORK IN THE SAME POSITION? FOR TEN YEARS. AND NEVER BE INCREASED AS PAY. TO ME IS. ROTH. AND I HAD HAD SOMETHING TO THAT. I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER QUICK SO IT. YOU YOU AND IT. O. I I GET DURING MY PROGRESSION AS I PROGRESSED THROUGH THE SERIES. I HAVE THREE. UNDERGRADS IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND BIOLOGY AND AS I PROGRESSED THROUGH THE CSU. I PICKED UP AN MBA I PICKED OF A MASTERS IN INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT EVERYTHING THEY ASKED ME TO DO. TO HELP OUT WITH THE RUNNING THE SYSTEM HELPING OUT MY ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT. PAID OUT OF MY OWN POCKET HOWEVER. HE STAYED THE SAME. THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO. THINK MISTER TURNOUT LOOK AT THIS BILL FROM FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AYE I ONCE WAS THE PRESENT A LARGE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. IN THE U. S. AND. WE WE ALSO RAN TO THE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. SORRY. A SOLID STEP SCALE AND A CONSISTENT NUMBER ACTUALLY HOPES INSTITUTION IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. NUMBER ONE ITS LONG TERM BUDGET PLAN. NUMBER TWO WHICH WE FOUND OUT AT THE TIME WERE DEFICIENT AND HAVING SUPERVISORS. ACTUALLY DO EVALUATIONS FOLLOW THROUGH. EXCITED BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IN THESE LARGE INSTITUTIONS. I'M NOT AN EXPERT OF YOUR INSTITUTION BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHERE WE WERE AT. THE A ONE OF THE PLANS WE HAD. WAS THAT WOULD THE MANAGEMENT WAS NOT DOING EVALUATIONS. AND THEREFORE BREEZES ONE HAPPENING AND THEREFORE PREDICTED HE WAS A LITTLE BIT LOWER TO. BUT IT ALSO FORCES AN INSTITUTION TO DO DO SALLY SURVEYS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHETHER WHAT INST OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE PAYING. AND IN THAT HELPS TO RETAIN EMPLOYEES NOW. I WILL SAY THIS BILL TO. THERE ARE TOOLS IN AN INSTITUTION HAS EVEN IF THIS WAS SET IN STONE. OF THAT COULD BE OFF RAMPS THE TOUGH BUDGET TIMES BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT THAT AS WELL RIGHT THERE'S. IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS YOU CAN GO TIME AND MOTION STUDY THAT WOULD MAKE AN ORGANIZATION MORE EFFICIENT. AND THE INSTITUTION JUST HAS TO BE CREATIVE ABOUT HOW ABOUT HOW IT APPROACHES IT ITS CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. OTHERS ALSO LAYOFFS AND FURLOUGHS I MEAN THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS IN AN INSTITUTION CAN DO THAT ARE THAT ARE. MAYBE NOT POPULAR TO THE FOLK FROM THE STABLE BUT THERE ARE OFFERING AMPS UP THE BUDGET. THE BUDGET DECLINES IN THE LEGISLATURE'S DONE AND INSTITUTIONS THAT I KNOW BECAUSE I WAS IN A PLACE WHERE WHO DO ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. A LAYOFF SOME FURLOUGHS AT A TIME WHEN WHEN WE WERE GOING INTO A REALLY TOUGH UP BUDGET SITUATIONS AT THE STATE. SO THAT IS SO I JUST WANT CERTAINLY PEOPLE TO OUR OFF RAMPS ON AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY A BAD A. AND THINK THE I MEAN IT WE WILL RUIN AN INSTITUTION. THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS ISSUE CAN DO AGAIN OP PRESS UPON THE INSTITUTION AND LOVE THE LAST pPOINT REALLY IS. FOLKS COME TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND SEEKTHE SORT OF SOLUTIONS WHEN ALL ELSE FAILED. I MEAN I I TRUST AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE IF A CONTRACT IF THE BARGAINING TABLE WASN'T WORKING. AND AND IF THIS HAD BEEN A LONG TERM FIGHT THAT THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO. HANDLE THOSE ARE MY TWO CENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MISTER PATTERSON. AS CHAIRMAN OF. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS. TERRY APPRECIATE YOU COMING. AND I'M COMING AT THIS FROM. LIFELONG RESIDENT FRESNO CALIFORNIA FRESNO STATE GRAD AND YOUR FRIEND. NOW AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU DO. AND I PAID ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS AT OUR UNIVERSITY. WE ARE DOING SOME VERY WONDERFUL THINGS AND I APPRECIATE IT ALL. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK I THINK. I THINK I THINK OF THE SUPPORT STAFFS ARE UNDERVALUED. AND I THINK IT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT YOU WANTED TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE. YOU WANTED TO NEGOTIATE. AND FRANKLY YOU ARE UNABLE TO DO SO. I'VE ALSO NOTICED. THAT HE EXECUTIVES. GET NICE RAISES. THE PROFESSORS GET DECENT RAISES. ARE I I ACTUALLY THANK YOU BEEN LEFT BEHIND ON THIS. AND SO I'M GONNA GLADLY SUPPORTED AND WE CAN JUST FIND WAYS TO. TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. MS BAKER. I THINK I JUST HAD BECAUSE SOME OF THE ISSUES OF COME UP LIKE I'VE HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS. AT WERE EITHER FIRST SEE AS YOU WERE. AT THE AUTHOR. HOW FREQUENT ARE THE EVALUATIONS? AND THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO GET A THUMBS UP. THAT SOMETIMES A CRITICISM OF STEPPING COLUMN IS THE RIGOR OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS. IT IS IT AND IT AND THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO GET IT IF IT BECOMES I'M NOT SAYING IT'S ON AUTO PILOT BUT IT'S HELPFUL FOR ME TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. HOW FREQUENT IF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER? AND THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO GET THE THUMBS UP OR. IF IT IS THUMBS UP OR DOWN AND AND I'VE I'VE WE APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION. IT'S A IT'S A YEARLY EVALUATION. GIVEN IN OCTOBER. AND ME BEING THE THE CHIEF STORED AT FRESNO STATE OCTOBER'S VERY BUSY FOR ME. BECAUSE MOST OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE CALLING ME ARE CALLING BECAUSE OF. UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE EVALUATION. SO THEY ARE. REGIMENTED THAT THEY ARE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS ARE CALLED PIPS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THOSE EMPLOYEES. SO YES THEY ARE. VERY STRICT WITH THOSE. ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE THAT'S MY BUSIEST MONTH AND THAT THE CALLS PICK UP. DRAMATICALLY IF THAT WAS THE AYE IMPOSE THE FIVE PERCENT THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE RECOMMENDED FOR THAT EMPLOYEE UNTIL TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE TO MOVE TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THANK YOU PAINT A PERCENTAGE THAT YOU I'M NOT SURE HOW WHAT WHAT'S UP WHAT DID THE UPPER DOWN WOULD BE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STEP INCREASES RIGHT NOW SO IT'S NOT LIKE EVALUATIONS A LEADING YOU ON A STEP INCREASE OF ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE I'M NOT SURE. OF THAT. I'D AS IT IS A CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT I DID STAFF EVALUATION FOR MY CLASSIFIED STAFF AND I HAD TO DO THAT EVERY YEAR. AND THEY WERE VERY RIGOROUS IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY LOOKING AT THE GOALS THAT HAD BEEN SET AND WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH DURING THAT TIME FRAME AND IN SETTING NEW GOALS. MUCH MORE RIGOROUS AND I SIGNED IN MOST EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES IT'S QUE TWELFTH FOR INSTANCE IN TERMS OF REALLY HAVING TO DO IT EVERY IT WAS NOT OPTIONAL FOR ME IS THAT YOU HAVE A DEPARTMENT. I HAD TO DO THE EVALUATIONS I HAD TO LOOK AT PAST EVALUATIONS HAD TO SIT WITH THAT MEMBER AS OF THAT STAFF MEMBER BUT CLERICAL PERSONS AT MY OFFICE. AND GO OVER THE VALUATIONS AND HAD TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FUTURE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. AND THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO WORK ON AND THOSE WHO DID MAKE IT EVENTUALLY WERE GIVEN A PLANNED FOR IMPROVEMENT AND INFLATED IMPROVE BASICALLY WERE TERMINATED FROM THE SYSTEM. SO IT IS IT WOULD IT WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY AND MY OFFICE BY BEING EVEN WITH REGARDS EVALUATION AND MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT WAS WITH EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING THE SAME THING BECAUSE THERE IS A TIME FRAME. AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF DOING IT OR NOT DOING IT. BUT WAS NOT TIED TO STEP INCREASE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM AT THAT TIME AFTER THEY GOT RID OF THEM THEY WERE NOT THERE UP BUT THEY'VE WE PRIOR TO A CERTAIN PERIOD TIME THEY WERE BUT. DIDN'T ALSO WANTS TO MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT FRESNO STATE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW FRESNO STATE WAS THE ONLY COLLEGE THIS YEAR TO WIN A MAJOR BOWL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL. THAT WE HAVE THE BULLDOGS AND ARE ALL PROUD OF WHAT THEY ARE SO. THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY. I THOUGHT. I TO AM A PRESIDENT STATE ROUTE AND APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR SUCCESSFUL FILM BUT THEY ALSO HAVE PRESIDENT CASTRO HAS. SERIOUS SERIOUS NEEDS ON THE CAMPUS INFRASTRUCTURE WISE. AND EVERY DOLLAR THAT GETS PUT TOWARD SALARIES A DOLLAR YOU CANNOT USE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT IS ON OUR BUDGET FOR NOW ON. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO I I WILL THINK THE. COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR I THINK VERY GOOD FRANK DISCUSSION. I THINK. THERE'S MUCH THAT I AGREE WITH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON. MANY OF THE MEMBERS ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAVEZ. YOU KNOW APPRECIATING THE THE WORK OF OF THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES OF THE SUPPORT STAFF. I I WAS A. LONGTIME TEACHERS SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE. YOU KNOW SCHOOLS DO NOT OPERATE WHETHER THEY BE. THE K. TWELVE OR CSU SYSTEM OR THE UC SYSTEM. UP WITHOUT THE SUPPORT STAFF OFTEN TIME THE SUPPORT STAFF IS THE FIRST PERSON THAT STUDENTS ME. WHETHER THAT BE THE. THE SECRETARY IN THE DEPARTMENT OFFICE. OR OR THE CUSTODIAN IN THE DORMITORY. AND SO THEY MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO THE WORK THAT YOU DO MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND I I SUPPORT THOSE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO YOU KNOW WHO SAY THAT WE NEED TO VALUE. THAT WORK AND WE NEED TO VALUE THAT WORK BY DEMONSTRATING THAT IN IN THE PACE SO I I THANK. SIMPLY MEMBER JOB IS FOR BRINGING UP THOSE THINGS. AS WELL AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON. AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND AS WE HAVE SAID OFTENTIMES. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T JUST SAY THAT WE SUPPORT. WHETHER IT BE THE CLASSIFIED STAFF OR THE. FACULTY AND THEN NOT GIVE GOOD THE FUNDS TO THE. TO THE SYSTEMS. SO I I I SEE THE DILEMMA THAT WE FACE. I AM SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE HOWEVER BUT I WILL AGAIN REMIND OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THAT WE NEED TO VERY STRONGLY VOICE OUR OPINION WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET. AS WELL. SO WITH THAT.

YOUR TESTIMONY IN THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. I TRY TO BE BRIEF. THANK YOU ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OVER TWO POINT ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS RISEN RELY ON A WORKFORCE OF OVER FORTY THOUSAND. PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS. DESPITE THE GOAL THAT IS LONG BEEN. IN EDUCATION CODE OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY THREE POINT SIX OF ALL. CREDIT CLASSES ARE BEING TAUGHT BY PART TIME FACULTY. WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE PART TIME FACULTY. THEY THEY THEY WOULD CLOSE DOWN. THERE IS A DISTINCT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AFTER CLASSES ACCESS TO FACULTY AND STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT INFORMATION ON PART TIME FACULTY OFFICE HOURS ARE NOT REPORTED. THIS BILL. WOULD INCLUDE A REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF PART TIME FACULTY OFFICE HOURS AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL. AND WOULD REQUIRE THAT INFORMATION BE PUBLICIZED ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WEBSITES. THE BILL ALSO SUPPORTS THE GOALS OF THE STUDENT SUCCESS ACT BY INCLUDING THE COLLECTIONS OF METRICS CRITICAL FOR STUDENT SUCCESS. AS A TEACHER IS. COMMUNICABLE EDGE TEACHER PART TIME. THERE ARE THINGS THAT FULL TIME. OF FACULTY CAN DO WITH OFFICE HOURS THAT PART TIME FACULTY CANNOT. THE PROJECTS OR THE. ASSIGNMENTS THAT YOU GIVE YOUR STUDENTS. THAT REQUIRE CONSULTATION WITH THE STUDENTS REALLY CANNOT BE DONE SUCCESSFULLY IF THERE ARE NO OFFICE HOURS GIVEN TO PART TIME FACULTY. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM WITH THEIR STUDENTS SO WITH THIS BILL IS ASKING IS JUST THAT WE COLLECT THE DATA. THAT WE COLLECT THE DATA AND REPORT. ON HOW THE DISTRICTS ARE DOING AND GIVING OFFICE HOURS BUT TO PART TIME FACULTY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YEAR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. AN ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITH WITH ME. WITH HARRY IS A COURTNEY COOPER PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT SENATE AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND JOHN GO LASKY PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER ECHO BRIO COLLEGE AND I HOPE I. PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY MORE LET'S THINK IT. THANK YOU. LL SO. AS ESTATE AYE MY NAME IS COURTNEY COOPER I AM A STUDENT AT FOOTHILL COLLEGE AND THE PRESIDENT THE STUDENTS IN A CULT FOR INCOMMUNICADO AS WHICH REPRESENTS THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION TWENTY COLLEGE STUDENTS. IN THE STATE AND THIS IS JUST A VITALLY IMPORTANT BILL. FOR ME I KNOW PERSONALLY AS A STUDENT I HAVE HAD TO GO TO DIFFERENT CITIES JUST TO GET OFFICE HOURS WITH THE TEACHER I HAVE HAD TO DRIVE OUT. AND I'M LOOKING OF WHERE I NOW DRIVE BIRD I KNOW FOR MY YOUNGER BROTHER HE DOESN'T DRIVE AND HIS DEMETER. AND THAT'S A THREE HOUR BUS RIDE JUST IN BETWEEN OUR HOME AND WHERE THE SCHOOL IS AND AT LEAST A MAJOR IF HE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HIS PROFESSORS FORGET THE CULTURES. THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL. AND AS WE BOTH FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THAT COMPLETION RAISE ONLY ABOUT THREE PERCENT FOR US FOR MATRICULATION RATE SO. THIS IS SOMETHING CRITICAL WHERE IF WE COULDN'T PERHAPS THE ABILITY TO GO ONLINE TO LOOK AT THE REPORT CARD FOR SCHOOL AND NO. TRULY WHAT ARE WE GET OURSELVES INTO DO WE HAVE SUPPORT FROM OUR PART TIME FACULTY WHEN WHERE WHEN WERE ON THESE CAMPUSES. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO MAKE THOSE INFORMED DECISIONS BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE HIDDEN COST OF GOING TO COMMUNICATE WHICH. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL INCIDENTS PART. PLEASE THANK YOU UP MY NAME IS JOHN GOV SKI AND I'M A PART TIME INSTRUCTOR CAMINO COLLEGE HAVE TAUGHT THERE FOR ABOUT TWENTY SOME YEARS. AS AN ADJUNCT AND. THIS ISSUE IS REALLY IMPORTANT ACCESS TO PROFESSORS IS PART OF ITS IT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE JOB OF STUDENT SUCCESS OF WHAT A STUDENT NEEDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME NOT TO AT THAT TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE DON'T HAVE A OFFICE HOURS FOR ALL INSTRUCTORS IN THE CLINICAL SYSTEM. I'M LUCKY BECAUSE IT CAMINO COLLEGE WE DO PAY OUR PARTS AND INSTRUCTORS TO HOLD APPROPRIATE OFFICE HOURS BUT AT. SOMETHING LIKE A TWENTY SOME PERCENT OF THE DISTRICTS THEY DO NOT PAY PART TIME FACULTY TO HOLD OFFICE HOURS THERE A COUPLE DISTRICTS THAT PAY SOMETHING RIDICULOUS LIKE. ONE HOUR PER SEMESTER PER CLASS THERE ARE OF SEVERAL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T PAY IF THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH MONEY FROM THE STATE SOMETIMES THEY DO TO. THOSE DID YOU SEE FUNDS AND IT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THE LUCK OF THE DRAW WHETHER STUDENT HAS ACCESS TO THE PROFESSOR NOT IT'S KIND OF LOW HANGING STUDENT SUCCESS FRUIT IN MY OPINION. OF THE STATE THROWS A LOT OF MONEY AT THESE INITIATIVES GUIDED PATHWAYS TO SUCCESS AND THAT'S REALLY GOOD AND THEY DO REALLY GOOD THINGS. BUT THE LOW HANGING FRUIT SCENE SUCCESS IS REALLY ACCESSED YOUR PROFESSOR SO I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MORE BASIC ASPECT OF STUDENT SUCCESS IS KIND OF IGNORED AT THE STATE LEVEL. ARE AND IT'S NOT A SEXY INITIATIVE YOU KNOW IF WE CALL IT. A PART TIME OFFICE HOURS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS AND GUIDE PATHWAYS MAYBE YOU GUYS WOULD. HELP A LITTLE MORE I DON'T KNOW BUT IT IT RELEASE FLABBERGASTING TO ME AS TO WHY STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO PROFESSORS ACROSS THE SYSTEM IT'S IT'S VITAL. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BRIAN HOW CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE AS PART THAT GIVES. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES. MISTER JARVI. I'M. SO REMEMBER MEDIAN I REALLY APPRECIATE BIGGEST FOR A MEMBER I WAS LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. AND ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL HASN'T CHANGED ALL. HOW YOU GONNA DRESS IS CONCERNED ABOUT TEN PERCENT? OF THE TOTAL COSTS GOING THERE WOULD GOING TO MANAGEMENT REQUESTED TO DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND WHICH AS HE SAYS IN THIS PASSAGE. WOOD TAKES WAY MONEY THAT WOULD BE GOING TO HELP OUT STUDENTS SINFUL AND PART TIME FACULTY SO. WHAT SURE? WAY RESPONDING TO HIS VETO MESSAGE. I NEVER GIVE UP HOPE. WELL HOPE TO WONDERFUL THING WHAT'S THE PLAN. IN THE END I AND I SAY THAT ACTUALLY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER AYE INSINCERITY. SO WE'VE WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THIS HOUSE. BY THE LEGISLATURE. THAT HAVE TAKEN MANY ATTEMPTS. YOU NO ONE THAT COMES MOST READILY QUICKLY TO MINE. IS A THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND I KNOW THAT OUR PREDECESSOR HERE. YOU KNOW I THINK OVER FIVE DIFFERENT TIMES INTRODUCED THAT BILL ONLY TO HAVE IT VETOED. THAT TIME AFTER TIME. AND SO PERSISTENCE R. IS WORTH SOMETHING. AND. WHEN SOMETHING IS NEEDED. WE DON'T GIVE UP. AND I THINK THIS IS MUCH NEEDED. SO TWO THINGS TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. I I THINK THAT THE. COST CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. ARE. HA EXAGGERATED. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE COST. IS WHAT HE SAYS IT IS. SO I I THINK THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE COST. ONE. AND TO. I WILL BE HAVING A FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO LOOK FOR. ALSO COSTS A. SAVING MEASURES THAT WE CAN DO AND IMPLEMENTING THIS BILL. SO. WITH THOSE TWO THINGS. JARVIS I HOPE TO HAVE BETTER LUCK. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES AS WEBER. AYE DISCIPLINE ONE I THINK GO FOR HER CHEER FOR FOR ONCE AGAIN BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW AT SOME. A IT'S A DIFFICULT. CHALLENGE ALWAYS A CONFLICT COME BACK WITH THINGS OVER. BUT YOU ALWAYS TWEAK THEM IN HOPES THAT SOMEONE OTHER THAT IT IT IT GETS ACROSS. YOU'LL HAVE OFFICE HOURS ARE AT ME OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WOULD NOT AN INSTANT IN THE INSTITUTION ITSELF. I DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHY OFFICE HOURS ARE IMPORTANT AND SOME OF MY FRIENDS WHO WORK OR AT THE UNIVERSITY WOULD ALWAYS WONDER WHAT'LL I DO THE REST OF THE DAY. AFTER I SPENT. SEVEN EIGHT HOURS TEACHING YOU KNOW AB FOR THE WEEK WHAT DO I DO WITH ALL THIS OF THE TIME. RESEARCH AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT IMPORTANT. BUT ALL BUT MOST IMPORTANT MEETING WITH STUDENTS I MEAN THAT IS CRITICAL OF IT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH SOMETIMES. MORE THAN THAT THE OTHER CAMPUSES BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND IS THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS WHO AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL ARE THE ONES WHO PROBABLY NEED THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF. GUIDANCE AND TOUCHING AND FOLKS BASICALLY HELPING THEM TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO REMAIN THERE WERE OTHERS MAY HAVE COME WITH THE SPECIFIC MISSION IN MIND THAT A BE AEROSPACE UP ANOTHER WHATEVER. AND AND SO THE ASSISTANCE THEY SEEK MAYBE NOT ONLY JUST TECHNICAL ABOUT WHAT THE STUFF IS WRITTEN A BOOK BUT I OFTENTIMES AT THE AT THE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL BECAUSE YOU HAVE STUDENTS ENTERING. WHO SOMETIMES ARE NOT REAL CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO? WHO? ARE NOT SURE HOW ALL OF THE STUFF THEY'VE LEARNED FITS TOGETHER IN A PATTERN OF SOME SORT. AND I REALLY MAY BE COMING OUT ENVIRONMENT WHERE HIGHER IT IS NOT A. AND SO YOU HAVE THE STUDENTS THERE WHO REALLY NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. WITH. WITH WITH INDIVIDUALS ABOUT WHY THEY'RE IN SCHOOL AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HOW THIS FITS TOGETHER. AND MANY STUDENTS AB THAT EVENTUALLY MADE IT TO THE UNIVERSITY TO SENEGAL STATE. WOULD OFTEN TELL ME THAT THE REASON WHY THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL AFTER TWO OR THREE YEARS OF TRYING TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT. WAS BECAUSE OF DOCTOR SO AND SO IS DOCTOR STARLAND LEWIS SO WHOEVER IT WAS AT THAT TIME AT THEIR COMMUNICABLE AS. THE STATE IN TOUCH WITH THEM THAT ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO SOMETHING THAT KEPT THEM FOCUSED. AND I KNOW WE'VE PUT A BIG PRICE OR BIG IDEA ON HAVING STUDENTS INTO THE INSTITUTION IN GRADUATE IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME. A AND AND THAT'S A BIG PRIORITY AT THIS CAPITA WE'VE SAID THAT. WE'VE ALSO SAID THE CENTRAL TO THAT IS MENTORING. AND COUNSELING. AND OFTEN TIMES COUNSELING IS NOT IN THE COUNSELING CENTER. BUT IN THE CLASSROOM. OR OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM WITH THAT PARTICULAR FACULTY MEMBER AND SO MANY STUDENTS HAVE NEVER SEEN IT A CAMPUS COUNSELOR. BUT THEY HAVE SEEN THEIR PROFESSOR. THEY'VE SEEN THE PERSON IN THE CLASSROOM SO I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING THIS BECAUSE IT IS IT'S IT'S WHAT THE INSTITUTIONS DO AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT IS MORE THAN THE HOUR A DAY IN CLASS WITH THE PROFESSOR IT'S OFTENTIMES OUTSIDE EXPERIENCE IN THE CONVERSATION THAT MOTIVATES AT STUDENTS TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO DO THE JOB TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL AND. AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING THESE ISSUES THAT IMPORTANT. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS AT LEAST IT OVER THE LAST TEN TWELVE YEARS WE HAVE JUST DRAMATICALLY ALTER R. C. ISSUES AND I UC'S IN TERMS OF. WHAT THEIR CULTURE IS ALL ABOUT AND HOW THEY OPERATE AND HOW THEY DEAL WITH STUDENTS IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS UNDER UNDER DIFFICULT TIME TO DO THAT? TIMES ARE BETTER. AND WE SHOULD BE DOING BETTER.
