A CELLULAR DEVICE WE ALSO KNOW

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.887
THAT OVER 50% OF ALL HOMES IN

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.589
THE U. S. USE ONLY A CELLULAR

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.730
THE REALITY IS THAT SENATOR

LIFELINES YET.

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:10.369
THERE ARE LIMITATIONS OVER THE

NATURAL AND HUMAN CAUSED

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:15.875
DISASTERS HAVE PUSHED THE SYSTEM.

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.510
BEYOND WHAT.

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:19.111
IT WAS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.880
WE NOW WE KNOW THAT -- WHEN

PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE SITE

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.717

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:28.020
THEY CAN ACCESS INFORMATION

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.655
RELATED TO ONGOING DISASTERS?

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.590
AND WE HAVE SEEN SUCCESS STORIES

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:32.625
DEMONSTRATING THAT WHEN THE

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:40.566
SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE IT CAN BE A

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:41.367
POWERFUL LIFESAVING TOOL.

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:42.368
THE PROBLEM IS THAT.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:44.070
WE'VE ALSO DEMONSTRATED ACCOUNTS

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:46.105
THAT POINT TO INCONSISTENCIES IN

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:46.405

MANY TIMES DURING THE DISASTROUS

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:48.741
OTHER SYSTEM SIMPLY DOES NOT

00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:03.589
I'VE TESTIFIED NUMEROUS TIMES

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:04.957

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.494
OFFLINE DURING RECENT DISASTERS.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.062
WE HAVE DOCUMENTED OUTAGES THAT

THAT OCCURRED ON MARCH TWENTY

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.003
THIRD OF THIS YEAR WHEN THE

OR NINE ONE ONE FOR OVER TWENTY

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.544
EIGHT HOURS DUE TO A FIBRE OPTIC.

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:30.182
BREAK AND THE LACK OF REDUNDANCY.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.317
THE FCC HAS PUBLISHED A TWO

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:33.285
STICKS ON SECULAR OUTAGES DURING

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.620
HURRICANES.

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:35.855
THE STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE

THE CAMPFIRE AND WILL SEE FIRES.

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:55.141
THIS MEANS THAT YOU WERE IN IF

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:56.408
THAT IF YOU WERE IN THESE IMPACT

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:59.778
AREAS YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO CALL

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:00.312
911- YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:01.247
RECEIVE AN ALERT.

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:03.282
AND IN MANY CASES YOU COULD NOT

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:04.917
USE YOUR CELL DEVICE TO ASSIST

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:08.053
YOU WITH THE TERM IN THE SAFEST

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.921
EVACUATION ROUTE.

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:10.656
WHEN WE REVIEW THE FCC OUTAGE

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:12.124

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:14.827
LANDFALL?

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:16.362
THEY WERE COUNTIES WHERE OVER

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:17.897
50% OF THE CELL SITES WERE OFF

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.064

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.566
DURING HURRICANE MICHAEL.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.368
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:24.803
WERE COUNTIES WHERE OVER 75% OF

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.072
THE CELL SITES WERE OFFLINE DAYS

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:27.840
AFTER THE HURRICANE MADE

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:28.841
LANDFALL.

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.643
PC SIX SIX STATISTICS CALL INTO

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.145
QUESTION THE WRITTEN RELIABILITY

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.780
OF OUR NATION'S PRIVATELY ONLY

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:36.749
MANAGE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM --

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:40.052
AN ERROR WE BELIEVE IT HOLDS

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:41.687
TRUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:43.055
WHERE WE CAN POINT TO SUCCESS

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.423
STORIES THAT THE CYSTIC

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.291
STATISTICS SHOW?

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:46.225
THAT THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:48.127
DONE OUT AND TO BE FAIR THERE'S

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:49.795
BEEN SOME HARDENING.

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:50.729
IN UPGRADES.

00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:52.431
OF THE SYSTEM IN IN CERTAIN

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.666
PLACES IN THE STATE AND THIS

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:55.401
OTHER PROVIDERS HAVE WORKED HARD

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:56.502
TO ENHANCE THEIR PORTABLE

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:57.836
GENERATOR SOLUTIONS AND

00:13:57.903 --> 00:14:00.339
DEPLORABLE SOLUTIONS LIKE CELLS

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.174
ON LIGHT TRUCKS ARE COLDS.

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.375
SELLS ON WHEELS WERE EVEN MORE

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:05.311
RECENTLY CELLS ON WINGS OR

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.379
FLYING CALLUSES THERE FOR

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.047
ACTUALLY CALLED.

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:09.682
WHILE THESE ARE PORTABLE AND

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:11.483
DEPLORABLE SOLUTIONS PROVIDE THE

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.219
CAPABILITY AND THE TRAP AND

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:14.887
TEMPORARY SOLUTION FOR WHEN CELL

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:17.289
SITES GO DOWN DURING A DISASTER.

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.258
THEY ARE SIMPLY NO SUBSTITUTE

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:20.859
FOR SOUTHERN NETWORK THAT IS

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.127
DESIGNED TO BE MORE RESILIENT

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:23.495

THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY THAT A

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:26.999
PORTABLE SOLUTION COULD SUPPORT

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:29.535
THE NEED WHEN OVER 50% OF SET

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.203
ASIDES IN A COUNTY GO DOWN I

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.471
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.173
COLLECTIVELY FOCUS.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.709

COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:42.648
AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.884
MEANS THAT -- AT THE PATH

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:46.485
FORWARD.

OTHER DISASTER.

THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE THAT

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.044
EXIST IN THE CELLULAR NETWORK

CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN.

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:17.349
CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.784
BY PARTNERING WITH OUR

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.653
TELECOMMUNICATION PARTNERS. TO

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:21.620
MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:23.255
ENSURE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY GREAT

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.356
CONSISTENCY IN

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:26.792
TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- AND

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:27.860
ULTIMATELY THIS WILL SAVE LIVES.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:32.431
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:33.832
AFTERNOON MICHAEL PICKER I WORK

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.000
AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.302
UTILITIES COMMISSION.

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:38.070
I'M GONNA ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.605
ON THE CLICK ON THESE ISSUES IS

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.807
THE UNDERLYING RELIABILITY AND

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:44.443
RESILIENCY OF THE CORE SYSTEM

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.578
THAT PROVIDES TO THE THIS IS

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:48.447
SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCY

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:50.983
COMMUNICATIONS -- I'M GONNA TALK

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.418
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY WHAT I'VE

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:53.485
LEARNED ABOUT THIS IS THIS

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:55.087
INDUSTRY WHEN I FIRST CAME TO

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:57.356
THE P. YOU SEE I I REALIZED THAT

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:59.792
WE HAD VERY LITTLE REGULATORY

00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:00.459
AUTHORITY OVER THE

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:02.695
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY.

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:04.063
THAT WHERE THERE WAS IT WAS A

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.131
PATCHWORK FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.834
TECHNOLOGY OR IFFERENT KINDS OF

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.669
SERVICES OVER TIME.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.538
SO I I WELL I WENT TO TO A

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:13.872
MEETING OF THE CALIFORNIA --

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:15.140
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:17.176
ASSOCIATION I ASKED HIM WHY ARE

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.711
YOU GUYS EVEN AT THE PUBLIC

00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:20.079
UTILITIES COMMISSION YOUR

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.680
COMPETITIVE WHY IF THERE'S A

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:23.182
MARKET FOR SERVICES AND THERE'S

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:24.850
OPPORTUNITY FOR CHOICE WHY WOULD

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.852
BE YOU CONTINUE TO BE REGULATED

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.187
BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:30.389
UTILITIES COMMISSION WHAT YOU

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:31.590
GET OUT OF IT.

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:32.725
CAN I GOT TWO ANSWERS THERE WERE

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:34.393
SOMEWHAT INSTRUCTIVE SO THE

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.795
FIRST IS THAT BECAUSE THEY HVE

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:38.764
A LICENSE TO OPERATE AS A

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.733
UTILITY EVEN WITHOUT MUCH

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.434
AUTHORITY AND REGULATION BEHIND

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:42.735
IT.

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.536
THERE THEN ENTITLED TO HAVE

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.338
ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:47.806
OF THE NETWORK OF WOODEN POLES

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:49.508
THAT ARE ACTED BY THE ELECTRIC

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.944
INDUSTRY. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.380
A WAY TO REACH CUSTOMERS ACROSS

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:56.248
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:57.483
AN FCC ROLE.

00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:59.017
THE SECOND REASON THAT PEOPLE

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:01.387
ARE FOR ME WAS THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:03.255
WERE UNDER THE THE UMBRELLA OF

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.923
THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.858
COMMISSION.

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:08.761
THERE'S ONE MARKET STATE WIDE

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:10.696
THAT AND ONE SET OF MARK A RULES

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.064
AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.766
A LOT OF LOCAL REGULATION WHICH

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:16.068
ALLOWS FOR FREEDOM OF INVESTMENT

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:16.835
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:18.203
AND TO SOME EXTENT ALL THESE

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.872
THINGS WERE DESIGNED TO HELP

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.440
BRING FORWARD BROADBAND

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:22.841
TECHNOLOGY INTO THE STATE OF

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.810
CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS NOT JUST THE

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.945
OLD COPPER WIRE TELEPHONE

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:27.746
SERVICE.

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:29.948
BUT PROVIDES ALL KINDS OF

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:31.517
DIFFERENT DATA SERVICE SYSTEMS

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:33.519
THAT ARE ENABLED BY FIBER ON THE

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:35.387
TECHNOLOGY AND BROADBAND

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.422
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:39.258
AND SO THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:41.226
SOME EXTENT AND I DON'T QUITE A

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:42.528
QUESTION AT ALL.

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:44.263
THE THE CHALLENGE THAT I'VE SEEN

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:47.466
EMERGING HOWEVER IS THAT -- AS

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.735
YOU START TO SEE THIS MOVEMENT

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:50.936
AWAY FROM A REGULATED ENTITY

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:52.371
PEOPLE ARE COMPETING FOR

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:54.540
CUSTOMERS AND THEY'RE COMPETING

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:56.375
FOR THE BEST CUSTOMERS THEY WANT

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:57.276
DENSITY OF CUSTOMER SO THAT YOUR

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:58.777
INVESTMENT REACHES THE MOST

00:17:58.844 --> 00:17:59.478
PEOPLE.

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.780
WHO WILL THEN BY SERVICES AND TO

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.282
BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THAT COST OF

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:06.585
THAT -- THOSE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:08.320
LIVE IN SPARSER AREAS OR P.

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:10.556
PORTIONS OF COMMUNITIES WHERE

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:12.191
THEY DON'T BUY THOSE HIGH AND

00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:14.326
SERVICES LOTS OF BAND WITH.

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:16.728
TEND NOT TO GET THE SAME KIND OF

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:19.031
SERVICES IN HIS AND GIVE SOME

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.299
EXPLANATION ON THAT.

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:21.600
THE FIRST THING I WILL SAY IS

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:22.868
THAT THE THE AMOUNT OF

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.736
COMPETITION ACROSS THE STATE IS

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:26.672
NOT EQUAL.

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:32.811
FROM PLACE TO PLACE -- OVER A

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:33.412
THIRD OF THE STATE THIRTY FIVE

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.247
PER SENT TO THE STATE ONLY HAS

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:36.148
ONE PROVIDER OR NO PROVIDER FOR

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:36.849
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.483
BROADBAND PROVIDERS.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:38.484
WE GIVE AWAY GRANTS FOR THE

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.985
CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.954
FUND TO BE ABLE TO HELP ALLOW

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.489
THOSE COMMUNITIES TO FIND

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:44.857
SOMEBODY WHO WILL PROVIDE THE

00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:47.192
BROADBAND AND THEN THEY CAN GET

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:49.094
DIFFERENT SERVICES OVER THAT BAR.

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.630
THAT BACKBONE PROVIDER.

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.398
THAT WAS PART OF OUR OUR

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.167
COMPETITION ANALYSIS TOOL WE DO

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:56.768
WE LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THERE IS

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:58.804
ACTUALLY COMPETITION AND THEN WE

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:00.906
LOOK TO SEE HOW THE SERVICE

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.674
QUALITY IS BEING PROVIDED.

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:05.043
SO WE DID A NETWORK EXAM THAT

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.645
THE RESULTS ARE FINALLY UP BUT I

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.847
CAN POINT TO SOME OF THE THE THE

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:10.215
INFORMATION THAT WE LEARNED

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:13.118
ABOUT THAT PERIOD FROM

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:14.753
200-010-22000.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.256
SEVENTEEN SO ONLY ABOUT 7% OF

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:19.825
CALIFORNIANS REALLY USE THE OLD

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:22.294
A PLAIN OLD OF PHONE SERVICE --

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:25.764
ITS DECLINE PRETTY STEADILY --

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.032
BUT BOTH [inaudible]

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.700
VERIZON.

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:31.403
FRONTIER IN EIGHTEEN T. HAVE HAD

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.704
A HIGHER RATE OF REPORTED

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:35.040
CUSTOMER OUTAGES AND LONGER TIME

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:37.809
PERIODS. TO RESTORE SERVICES TO

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.778
THOSE THOSE LIVE REMAINING

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:40.979
LANDLINE CUSTOMERS.

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.447
THESE TWO CARRIERS DID NOT

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.615
MAINTAIN THE NETWORK

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:47.085
INFRASTRUCTURE TO WITHSTAND.

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:48.720
JUST SIMPLE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:19:48.787 --> 00:19:51.823
CONDITIONS -- CUSTOMER ADAGES

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:52.891
INCREASE.

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.460
WHEN IT'S RAINING AND SNOWING?

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.596
MOST CENTRAL OFFICES DON'T HAVE

00:19:57.663 --> 00:20:00.599
REDUNDANCY OR BACKUP POWER

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:02.634
DURING EQUIPMENT FAILURES.

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:03.302
EIGHTEEN T. AND VERIZON FRONTIER

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.370
IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN OF FOCUSED

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:06.438
ON THOSE REALLY DENSELY

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.907
POPULATED URBAN SUBURBAN AREAS

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.309
WITH CUSTOMERS DO HAVE.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.010
DIFFERENT CHOICES WHEN THEY

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:15.414
DON'T GET THE QUALITY OF SERVICE.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.183
SO MANY THE THESE RURAL AREAS

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.418
AND SOME SUBURBAN AREAS ARE IN

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:21.320
THAT WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.655
THAT IS SEEN FIRES BUT IT'S ALSO

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.023
TRUE IN AREAS WHERE THAT ARE

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.592
PRONE TO FLOODING AND OTHER

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:28.694
KINDS OF CONTACT CATASTROPHIC

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.561
ISSUES.

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:31.129
I GOT TO SAY THAT IT DOESN'T

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:33.699
WORK FOR PUBLIC SAFETY EVEN ON A

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:35.300
DAY TO DAY BASIS.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:37.569
SO -- SPEAKING TO THE LOSS OF A

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.104
FIBER CABLE IN LAS

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:40.238
COMMUNICATIONS NINE ONE ONE A

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:42.274
PUBLIC SAFETY PROVIDERS IN LARGE

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:44.443
PARTS OF MENDOCINO HUMBLE

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:46.345
CINNAMON LAKE COUNTIES ARE

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.479
CENTER MIKE WEIR SAID.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.548
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OR RISK

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:51.617
WHEN A SIMPLE FIBER CUT CAN LEAD

00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:52.851
TO RURAL RESIDENTS NOT BEING

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.920
ABLE TO ACTION AN AMBULANCE THE

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:55.420
FIRE DEPARTMENT OF LAW

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:57.089
ENFORCEMENT IS A STANDS NOW HE

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:57.823
SAYS.

00:20:57.889 --> 00:20:59.658
TELECOM COMPANIES DON'T LET

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:00.959
EMERGENCIES OFFICIALS KNOW WHEN

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.494
THE LOCAL NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:05.097
NOT OPERATING WHICH PUTS THEM.

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:09.501
AND THEIR THEIR THEIR

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:11.069
CONSTITUENTS IN DANGER.

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.337
SO AGAIN SOME.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.839
RURAL AREAS DON'T HAVE THAT CELL

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.874
SERVICE THEY CAN COMPETE WITH A

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.876
PLAIN OLD TELEPHONE SERVICE THAT

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.645
I'VE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS BEING --

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:23.749
IN DECLINE -- I WON'T GO INTO

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.017
THE SPECIFICS IN THE INTEREST OF

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.752
TIME.

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:29.187
BUT WE DID DO A WORKSHOP THAT

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.590
REALLY REITERATED A LOT OF THE

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:35.694
THE THE DATE OF THAT -- THAT --

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:38.296
THIS -- DIRECTOR -- KILLER DUTY

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:39.698
HAS POINTED OUT THAT'S THE FIRST

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.700
TIME I'D HEARD ABOUT THE MASSIVE

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:43.735
LOSS OF THE SELF SITES.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:44.970
SO I STARTED LOOKING AROUND TO

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:47.205
SEE WHAT THE EXPERIENCE OF SOME

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:49.541
OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:52.344
WAR AND IT DURING EMERGENCY

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:54.780
EVENTS OR LEADING UP TO AND I

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:58.450
THE THE CINEMA COUNTY.

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:00.085
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY.

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:00.919
MANAGEMENT TO THIS AFTER STUDY

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.120
CALLED THE CINEMA COUNTY

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:02.788
OPERATIONAL AREA LURKING MORNING

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:04.623
FUNCTIONAL EXERCISE AFTER ACTION

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.491
REPORT.

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:09.628
WHICH IS HOW THEY TALK -- IT IN

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:10.729
PART OF THE EFFORT TO COUNTY

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.064
STAFF ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.331
PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:15.767
NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:16.635
PEOPLE THE DAY AGING KEEP SEEKS

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.170
ON EMERGENCY WARNING LIST.

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:19.638
THAT IS PURCHASED AND THEN IT'S

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:21.473
UP TO TWICE YEAR FROM EIGHTEEN

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.542
T. IN FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:25.944
BUT THEY CAN ONLY REACH 51% OF

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.612
THOSE PEOPLE SUCCESSFULLY TO

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:30.549
EITHER TALK TO SOMEBODY OR TO

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.451
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.485
IN IN A SUBSEQUENT PHASE OF

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:34.786
THEIR TEST THE COUNTY OFFICIALS

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.888
TARGETED FIVE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:38.023
FOR TEST OF THEIR EMERGENCY

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.658
NOTIFICATIONS TO WIRELESS

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:40.726
CUSTOMERS.

00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:42.327
AND THEY FOUND INCONSISTENT

00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:44.896
POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN HOW

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:47.299
PROVIDERS ALERT CUSTOMERS.

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:50.001
THAT MAKES THE TASK VERY HARD IF

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:52.337
SOMEBODY FOLLOWS BASICALLY A

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:55.574
LINE DRAWING OF A GEOGRAPHIC

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.308
AREA.

00:22:56.374 --> 00:22:58.310
AND PULLS OUT PARTICULAR

00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:00.912
CUSTOMERS WHO MAY HAVE A BILLING

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.714
ADDRESS FOR ANOTHER PROVIDER

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:05.383
ACTUALLY HAS A POLY GONE AROUND

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.952
A CELL TOWER THAT THE USED TO

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:09.121
CON A MAP OUT HOW YOU NOTIFY.

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:10.822
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT EASY THEN

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:13.024
FOR THE AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:14.626
A SIMPLE WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHO

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:16.695
TO NOTIFY IN A SPECIFIC

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:19.197
GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. FOR

00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:21.399
EVACUATION AND I THINK DIRECTOR

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:22.067
BILL OR DO YOU JUST TALKED A LOT

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:24.402
ABOUT THE NEED FOR BACKUP POWER

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:27.305
FOR THE SELL SIDE SO I WON'T GO

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:30.575
INTO THAT -- THE FOR US IT'S AS

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:31.376
GOOD AS CITY GREAT CHALLENGE TO

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:33.545
SEE HOW THE SYSTEM IS NOT GOING

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.614
TO OPERATE THE WAY THAT WE

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.948
EXPECTED.

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:38.884
AND THE WAY THE CONSUMERS RELY

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.119
ON IT BUT KNOWING AHEAD OF TIME

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:42.554
THAT THERE'S ALL THIS WEAKNESS

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:43.388
IS BOTH IN TERMS OF THE

00:23:43.455 --> 00:23:43.989
MAINTENANCE OF THE

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:45.924
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE DESIGN OF

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:47.926

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:09.067
COMING THAT EVENING.

00:31:09.133 --> 00:31:10.835
AND THEN FINALLY -- WE UTILIZE

BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:40.465

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:43.768
I THANK AHEAD.

00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:45.803
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR A QUOTE

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:46.671
THE A COUPLE QUESTIONS CAN IN

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.806
THIS BUT SPECIFICALLY MAYBE --

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:49.707
MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER WHAT

00:31:49.774 --> 00:31:52.010
SPECIFICALLY ARE THE OBSTACLES

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.712
IF YOU HAD THE LAN RIGHT AMOUNT

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:55.780
AND NUTS AND BOLTS.

00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:59.517
NOT AT A HIGH LEVEL.

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:00.652
A TO COMMUNICATING INTERNET

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:02.587
EMERGENCY.

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:04.856
I THINK ULTIMATELY.

00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:09.027
ITS ITS RELIABILITY -- OF THE

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:10.461
EXISTING SYSTEM.

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:15.433
YOU KNOW -- OF WHEN A WHEN A

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.535
SHELL SAY GOES DOWN -- WHEN A

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:22.273
FIBRE LINE GETS BURNED OR BROKEN --

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.574
BUT WE WE LOOK WE LOSE THAT THAT

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:24.742
SITE WE OR WE LOSE MULTIPLE

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:25.877
SITES.

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:30.081
AND AND THE REALITY IS IS THAT --

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:31.449
SAYS EVERYBODY'S DEPENDING UPON

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:33.851
THIS SYSTEM.

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.553
WE'VE PUT ALL OUR EGGS IN THAT

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.889
BASKET -- WE IN THE GOVERNMENT

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:39.791
HAVE VERY LITTLE.

00:32:39.857 --> 00:32:41.092
CONTROL OVER BUT WE'RE DEPENDING

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:41.993
UPON IT.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.562
MORE MORE. FOR ALL KINDS OF

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:45.930
VACATIONS THAT WE STILL HAVE OUR

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:47.231
LAND MOBILE RADIOS.

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:48.633
BUT THOSE -- COMMUNICATE TO THE

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.635
PUBLIC WHAT COMMUNICATES TO THE

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:51.736
PUBLIC.

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.271
IS THE SIDE OR NETWORK.

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:54.872
AND SO WHAT WHAT WE NEED IS

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:56.174
RELIABILITY.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.809
AND THAT MEANS WE NEED TO HAVE.

00:32:57.875 --> 00:33:01.713
THE FIBRIL LINES IN THE CABLE.

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.748
RAP AND MADE RESILIENT SO IT CAN

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:07.685
WITHSTAND -- DIFFERENT KINDS OF

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:10.321
IMPACTS WE NEED A CELL SITE

00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:11.289
THAT'S GOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:12.924
AROUND IT.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.959
AND IT'S HARD AND TO THE TO THE

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:16.627
DEGREE THAT IT'S PROTECTED.

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:19.931
FROM CERTAIN KINDS OF DISASTERS

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:21.199
WE DO HAVE BATTERY BACKUP OR

00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:22.633
GENERATOR BACKUP SO THAT WHEN

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.102
THE POWER GOES OFF.

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:25.670
IN A DISK IN A DISASTER OR IT'S

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:27.372
PREEMPTIVELY SHUT OFF BY THE

00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:29.040
UTILITY.

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:30.641
THAT THAT THE THOSE

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.410
COMMUNICATION SITES REMAIN IN

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:35.613
PLACE THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY --

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.416
TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE -- THE

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:40.518
COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE WE WE

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:41.986
NEED TO HAVE BECAUSE BECAUSE

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:43.388
EVEN AS WE MOVE TO WHAT'S CALLED

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:45.823
FIRST AT WHICH IS A BROADBAND IN.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.826
A PUBLIC SAFETY INTEROPERABLE.

00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:51.229
THE DATA SYSTEM.

00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:52.663
THAT'S USING THE SAME AND THAT

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:53.765
IN THE ADDRESS IS THE SAME EXACT

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:54.832
SYSTEM.

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:56.401
AS PUBLIC SAFETY MOVED TO THAT

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:59.170
MOVING DATA AND OTHER CRITICAL

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:01.472
INFORMATION -- IF THOSE SITES

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:02.974
ARE DOWN -- WE WE CAN'T

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.145
COMMUNICATE.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.946
SO WE TALK A LOT ABOUT

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:10.615
REDUNDANCY AND I ASKED AS IN OUR

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.150
PRIOR HEARING.

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:13.684
ARE WE AT THE POINT WHERE WE

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:15.319
NEED TO BE EQUIPPING EVERY

00:34:15.386 --> 00:34:17.221
MUNICIPALITY WITH SOME MEANS

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:19.424
RUDIMENTARY AS IT MAY BE A SIREN

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:21.025
SYSTEM AND OUT EN EL READ

00:34:21.092 --> 00:34:22.093
SPEAKER SYSTEM.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.195
SO THAT WE HAVE A FAIL SAFE

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:26.297
MECHANISM FOR COMMUNICATING

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:27.331
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY I

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:30.101
AM I AM LESS CONCERNED WITH HOW

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:32.103
WE WAIT YEARS UPON YEARS. TO

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.205
REFORM AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:35.540
PROBABLY ALREADY NEED SOME

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:37.508
REFORMING WE KNOW THESE FIRES

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.010
ARE IMMINENT.

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:41.012
WHAT DO WE DO TO SAVE LIVES?

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:44.081
NOW.

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.450
SO I'M JUST GOING TO POINT OUT

00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:47.618
THAT NOT EVERY COMMUNITY IS THE

00:34:47.685 --> 00:34:49.987
SAME IN VERY DANCE PORTIONS OF

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:51.889
THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:54.692
ELECTRIC GRID AND POOR AND MUCH

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:55.960
OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION GRID.

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:57.295
KIND OF LOOKS MORE LIKE AN A

00:34:57.361 --> 00:35:00.264
MASH WITH MANY DIFFERENT LINES

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:01.399
THEY CROSS AND WHERE THE WHERE

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:03.534
YOU CAN IF YOU CAN'T IF YOU

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:04.569
CAN'T ACTUALLY.

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:07.572
HAVE SERVICE MOVE FROM ONE PLOY

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:08.506
LINE TO ANOTHER IF THERE IS A

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:10.308
FAILURE AND SOME PORTION OF THE

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:14.178
LINE -- EQ YOU CAN YOU CAN GET

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.880
IT UP FAIRLY QUICKLY AND BUT

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.515
WHEN YOU GET INTO THE EDGES AND

00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:19.016
OUT INTO THOSE REMOTE OR

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.518
COMMUNITIES.

00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:21.652
THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE LINE

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.654
THAT STRINGS OUT OVER MANY MANY

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.756
MANY MILES YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

00:35:25.823 --> 00:35:28.192
KIND OF OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:30.561
TO USE A MASH. TO BE ABLE TO

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.964
PROVIDE SERVICE SO ALL KINDS OF

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.166
DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOLUTIONS ARE

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:36.501
GONNA PROBABLY APPLIED IN

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:37.902
DIFFERENT WAYS IN DIFFERENT

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:38.903

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.605

PARTNERSHIP WITH CELL PHONE

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:06.984
CARRIERS ON THIS ISSUE.

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:08.585
ADDITIONALLY DURING A PS PS WE

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:16.927
THOSE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.036
OF THAT.

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.771
THIS REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR

POPULATION.

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:42.753
LOCAL AGENCIES MAY NEED TO

RESORT TO DOOR TO DOOR CHECKS OF

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:47.524
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW ABOUT.

CONSTRAINED RESOURCES AND EFFORT.

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:55.265
AND THE EFFORT MAY NOT COVER THE

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:57.801
ENTIRE POPULATION AT RISK.

00:43:57.868 --> 00:43:59.536
MAKING SURE RESIDENTS UNDERSTAND

00:43:59.603 --> 00:44:02.439
WHAT A P. S. P. S. IS AND AND

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.475

BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE THE

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.438
FUNDAMENTAL BACKBONE UNDER WHICH

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:37.341

WE'VE TAKEN ESSENTIALLY A THREE

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:19.149
PRONGED APPROACH TO THAT AT THIS

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.718
POINT -- THE IRONIC PART OF

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:23.587
OCTOBER NINTH WAS WHEN THE SUN

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:26.990

VOICE OVER INTERNET.

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:42.406
CABLE BASED PHONES SO WE LOST

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:43.974
THAT COMMUNICATION.

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.710
ABILITY -- SO WE ARE ONE OF

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:48.512
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE.

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:49.913

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:07.164
MOST AGENCIES DON'T HAVE IT

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:07.731
AVAILABLE IN THEIR VEHICLES

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:10.100
ANYMORE -- BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:11.935
NATURE OF IT -- FOR FAMILIAR

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.904

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:00.103
EVEN A THIRD SOURCE OF

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.438
INFORMATION BEFORE THEY MOVE

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:02.672
INTO ACTION.

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.274
AND EXPECT THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:08.478
SUPPORT THAT -- IS PRESENT

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:09.846
PICKING INDICATE A PEASANT

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.948
PICKER OF CP SYNDICATE WE'D TO

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:13.183
CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT TEST IN

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:14.918
SUMMER COUNTY. TO REALLY TAKE A

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:17.220
HARD LOOK AT WHETHER THE SYSTEMS

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:19.089
PERFORM -- AND HE HIGHLIGHTED

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:21.257
SOME OF OUR FINDINGS I WOULD

00:54:21.324 --> 00:54:22.525
SUGGEST AN UNNATURAL THAT

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:24.928
ESSENTIALLY THE SYSTEMS NO

00:54:24.995 --> 00:54:25.929
MATTER WHICH TECHNOLOGY WE'RE

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:27.430
GOING TO DISCUSS TODAY.

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:28.798
SIMPLY DID NOT PERFORM AS

00:54:28.865 --> 00:54:31.001
ADVERTISED IN EACH ONE OF THESE

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:31.735
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:33.336
PERFORMANCE GAPS.

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:35.538
TECHNOLOGICAL HURDLES CHALLENGES

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:39.643
BECAUSE HE'S TECHNOLOGIES ARE

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:40.377
RELATIVELY.

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:41.277
JUNIOR TECHNOLOGIES COMPARED T

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:42.946
THEIR MORE OLDER AND WELL

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:44.547
RESOURCE TOLD -- COMMERCIAL

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:45.582
BRETHREN.

00:54:45.649 --> 00:54:46.149
THERE'S NOT MUCH MONEY ALERT

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:46.716
WARNING.

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:47.784
THESE PROGRAMS THESE

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:52.222
APPLICATIONS.

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:52.722
THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:55.425
EXERCISES ARE NOT NEARLY AS

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:58.561
ROBUST AND AS RESILIENT AS THE

00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:00.096
LARGER COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS ARE

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.531
ALL FAMILIAR WITH.

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:02.432
SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.100
BASICALLY TO BE HONEST WITH OUR

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:05.802
COMMUNITIES I TALK TO PEOPLE

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:07.370
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHILE WE

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:08.672
MIGHT TRY TO REACH THEM.

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:09.939
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GUARANTEE IT

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:11.941
THAT THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN SOME

00:55:12.008 --> 00:55:13.343
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.711

OUR LOCAL NEIGHBORS.

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.683
AND THEN FINALLY REALLY URGE OUR

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.451
INDUSTRY PARTNERS WHETHER IT'S

MOST OF US ARE ONLINE SOMETIMES

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:32.362
WE STILL CANNOT DELIVER WARNING

IF THEY'RE NOT A LOCAL CHANNEL

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.102
WE CAN'T REACH THEM.

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.837
OUR COMMUNITY HAS MOVED ON USED

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:42.038
TO COMMUNITY OUR COMMITTEES HAVE

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.740
MOVED ON USED TECHNOLOGIES IN

DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:47.143
OUR LORTON WARNING SYSTEMS HAVE

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.045
TO MAINTAIN THAT PACE AS WELL.

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:51.281
IN GENERALIZATIONS WAS NOTED IS

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:52.716
A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE I WILL.

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:54.484
POINT OUT FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:56.252
CHIEFS THAT THEY'RE ALL SITTING

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:57.587
WITH OTHER CHALLENGES TO

00:55:57.654 --> 00:55:59.489
AGGREGATION OF THEIR OWN

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.791

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:03.760
THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:05.562
ISSUES SUCH AS POTENTIALLY LOSS

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:08.331
OF WATER SUPPLIER PRESSURE.

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:09.833
THE REAL NIGHTMARE IS SPEAK TURN

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:11.701
OFF THE POWER THE CELL PHONE

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:14.137

BACKUP TAKE OFF LINE.

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:17.240
AND THEN A WILD FIRE BREAKS OUT.

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:18.842
NOW WE HAVE NO WAY TO REACH

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.310

WELL.

00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:28.785
SO IN MANY WAYS -- THE CHALLENGE

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:30.120
FOR CALIFORNIA IS THAT WHILE WE

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:32.322

DURING THESE GENERALIZATION

INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:56:58.715 --> 00:57:00.817
THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE BUILT AND

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:02.952
OPERATED AS SUCH.

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.320

BECAUSE MOST OF OUR ALERT

TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEMS TRULY

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:50.934
IN WELLIES SERVE THOSE WHO MOST

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:51.634
MAY NEED A WARNING SENATE

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.169
FINALLY I WILL.

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:56.206
SUGGEST THAT SIGNIFICANT

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.041
CHALLENGES LEADERSHIP AND MONEY.

00:57:58.107 --> 00:57:58.641
THE PROBABLY GET THIS ALL THE

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:01.311
TIME -- BUT I'M SURE WITH YOU

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:02.045
IT'S REALLY GONNA TAKE POLITICAL

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:04.948
MORE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS.

00:58:05.014 --> 00:58:06.349
AS A COUNTIES LOOK TO DEVELOP

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:07.884
THEIR CAPABILITIES IN THIS AREA.

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:08.852
OUR RECENT ACTIONS MIGHT GIVE

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:10.386
YOU SOME.

00:58:10.453 --> 00:58:11.487
IDEA OF THE SCALE OF EFFORT THAT

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:12.589

EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT STAFF.

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:31.074
I SPENT LITTLE TIME EACH MONTH

THAT'S FOR POPULATION OF FIVE

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:38.815
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE.

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:40.383

BECAUSE YOU CAN HEARTHE

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:48.925
COMPLEXITIES THE SYSTEMS CAN

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:23.493
AND THEN FINALLY WE DO NEED TO

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:25.328
BETTER INTEGRATE TECHNOLOGIES --

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:25.895
THAT ARE NOT TRADITIONAL TO

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:27.864
GOVERNMENT.

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:29.265
LIKE A WEBSITE IT'S NOT TOO HARD

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.133

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:32.201
EXCEPT IT DOESN'T WORK ON

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:34.237
DISASTER DOESN'T SCALE IT WILL

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:36.139
FAIL IN TOO MANY PEOPLE HAD IT'S

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:37.573
NOT DYNAMIC ENOUGH.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.242
IT'S RECRUITED A NEW WEBSITE

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:41.144
THAT AUTOMATICALLY POPULATES ONE

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.645

SEE IT IN WRITING.

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:02.765
SO CINEMA COUNTY LIKE MANY OF

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.100
HER PEERS IS WORKING HARD TO

SAID -- WITH REGARD -- TO WHAT

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.166
WE NEED TO DO.

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.134
IN TERMS OF MANAGING THE

RESPONSIBILITY.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.775
YOU RECEIVED A PRIMER I THINK ON

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:55.311
THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH REGARD

TO MERCY OF WARNING SYSTEMS I

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.315
THINK IT'S A GOOD OVERVIEW.

AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT WILL MY

REGARD TO THE NEED TO INCREASE

RELIABILITY AMAZON REDUNDANCY

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.290
WITHIN THE TECHNOLOGICAL

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:08.691
FRAMEWORK THAT WE USED TO NOTIFY

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:09.625
PEOPLE.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.294
THE FACT THE MATTER IS WE RELY

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.262
UPONTECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT IS

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:16.165
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:19.001
ALERT -- THE SIGNIFICANT ARE THE

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:19.535
MOST SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:20.470
PEOPLE.

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:21.771
BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS IT

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.372
RELIES UPON TECHNOLOGY AND IN

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:24.273
THE SEARCH OF THE SERVICE

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.908
CIRCUMSTANCES TECHNOLOGY

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:28.711
ULTIMATELY FAILS OR CAN FILTER

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:31.414
IT RATHER RATHER QUICKLY.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.049
CERTAINLY INCREASING RELIABILITY

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.050
OR DENNIS HE WOULD -- MITIGATE

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:36.319
THOSE RISKS BUT QUITE FRANKLY.

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:37.720
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD EVER

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:38.988
GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:39.956
ENSURE.

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:42.625
WITH 1100% CERTAINTY THAT

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:43.726
TECHNOLOGY WON'T FAIL.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:45.061
WHAT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:46.162
COURSE OF THIS IN TERMS OF

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:46.929
WARNING PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:48.030
MESSAGE ACROSS MULTIPLE

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:50.700
PLATFORMS?

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:52.468
YOU HAVE -- TO GET THAT

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:54.070
INFORMATION OUT BUT WHEN YOU

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:56.072
MESSAGE ACROSS PLATFORMS THAT

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:57.507
ARE AGAIN BASED ON TECHNOLOGY.

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.875
YOU'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE AT

01:02:58.941 --> 01:02:59.942
A DISADVANTAGE WHEN THAT

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.111
TECHNOLOGY FAILS.

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:03.279
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ORVILLE

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:04.714
SPILL INTO THE ARMY CORPS OF

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.615
ENGINEERS TO STUDY AND

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.049
ULTIMATELY CAME TO ME AND TOLD

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.551
ME THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:09.752
TO ALERT PEOPLE.

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:12.155
OF A THREAT. TO THEIR LIVES HAVE

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.289
A UNIFORMED LAW ENFORCEMENT OR

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:16.092
KNOCK ON THEIR DOOR UNTIL THEY

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:16.659
NEED TO LEAVE THE MEDIA ARE

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:18.895
GOING TO DIE.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:19.428
BUT THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:20.363
PRACTICAL BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:20.963
IS NOT ENOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:21.597
OFFICERS IN ANY COMMUNITY TO BE

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:22.598
ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.167
THAT'S A PRETTY LOW TECHNOLOGY

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:26.903
WAY TO NOTIFY PEOPLE THAT'S VERY

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:27.470
EFFECTIVE BUT IT'S JUST NOT

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:28.604
PRACTICAL.

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.805
SO WHAT ULTIMATELY LEARN FROM

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:31.674
ALL OF THIS IS HIS FIRST AND

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:34.110
FOREMOST.

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:34.977
DESPITE OUR ABSOLUTE BEST

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:37.013
EFFORTS AND OUR NEED TO PUT OUR

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.181
BEST FOOT FORWARD.

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.949
THERE IS NO WAY TO GUARANTEE

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.885
1100% SATURATION OF YOUR MESSAGE.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.620
AND THEN SECONDLY THERE'S NO

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:46.155
GUARANTEE THAT PEOPLE WILL DO

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:47.657
WHAT YOU ASK HIM TO DO OR WHAT

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:48.591
THEY NEED.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.159
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS PEOPLE

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.494
OFTEN AS YOU HEARD A NOR THE

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.629
WARNING.

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:54.764
BUT MORE TRAGICALLY THAN THAT IS

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.265
THERE NOT BE PREPARED TO DEAL

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:57.567
WITH THE WARNING.

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.968
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ALSO

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.870
NEED TO FOCUS -- CERTAINLY THESE

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.171
ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT.

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:03.639
BUT WE NEED TO WORK WITHIN THE

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.274
COMMUNITIES AGAIN TO MANAGE

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.677
THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND INSPIRE

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:10.046
SINCE RESPONSIBILITY IN THEM.

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:10.746
BUT THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:13.249
[inaudible] TO GATHER

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:14.283
INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.785
SOURCES EVEN WITH SOURCES THAT

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:17.820
THAT -- AREN'T TRADITIONAL IN

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.121
TERMS OF THE WAY THEY GATHER THE

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.923
INFORMATION -- THAT ARE BASED ON

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.591
TECHNOLOGY.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:22.358
AND THEN THEY HAVE TO BE

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.693
PREPARED TO REACT TO THAT

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:24.760
INFORMATION.

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.696
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE IN IN

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:28.197
GOVERNMENT OR WE IN PUBLIC

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.932
SAFETY CAN TAILOR A WARNING

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:31.867
SYSTEM OR EVACUATION PLAN THAT

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.636
MEETS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.037
EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL.

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:35.705
THERE HAS TO BE SOME

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:36.806
ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE PART

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.374
INDIVIDUAL TO KNOW WHAT.

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:39.542
THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS ARE WITH

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.010
THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:41.777
ARE HOW THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:42.745
DEAL WITH THAT.

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.347
AND THEN WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:46.048
DO IN IN A CRISIS AND YOU'VE

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.750
HEARD MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT.

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:53.356
US PUTTING OUT A WARNING --

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:54.390
PUTTING OUT WARNINGS TELLING

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.791
PEOPLE EVACUATED THEM CALLING

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:56.492
ASKING WHICH ROUTE.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.226
WAS NO WAY FOR US TO KNOW WHICH

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:57.727
ROUTE BECAUSE WE CAN'T

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:58.995
NECESSARILY DETERMINE WHICH WAY

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.496
THE FIRES COMING OR WHICH WITH A

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:01.063
FLOOD IS COMING OR WHAT THE

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.798
SITUATION IS. TO PEOPLE HAVE TO

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.433
BE PREPARED TO DO THAT ON THEIR

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.434
OWN.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:06.402
AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE HOST

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:07.536
HER WHOLE SEGMENT OF OUR OUR

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:12.008
POPULATION PEOPLE SPECIAL NEEDS.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.542
A WHO HAVE.

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:14.277
TO AFTER A PLAN IN PLACE AHEAD

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:15.411
OF TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:16.445
CAN GET OUT BUT THIS IS NOT

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:18.547
LIMITED TO PEOPLE SPECIAL NEEDS.

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:20.082
MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD --

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:21.617
EVACUATE FROM THE CAMPFIRE

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:23.419
WOULDN'T LEAVE BECAUSE THEY HAD

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:24.553
ANIMALS THAT THEY COULDN'T

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.255
EVACUATED THEY WOULD WANT TO

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:26.889
LEAVE THOSE ANIMALS.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.125
SO A WHATEVER THAT INDIVIDUAL'S

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:33.062
SPECIFIC NEEDS ARE -- WE HAVE.

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:35.331
TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND INFORM

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.033
THEM AND AGAIN INSPIRE IN THEM A

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:40.002
SENSE RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE A

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.836
PLAN AHEAD OF TIME.

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:43.372
BECAUSE FRANKLY WHEN IT'S TIME

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.007
TO PUT OUT THE WARNING YOU'RE

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:47.176
ALREADY IN DANGER THAT'S NOT THE

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.477
PLAN TO PREPARE THAT'S NOT THE

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:49.745
TIME TO PREPARE THAT'S NOT THE

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:50.513
TIME TO PLAN.

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:51.480
THAT'S THE TIME FOR YOU TO

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:52.815
EXECUTE THE PLAN THAT YOU'VE

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:53.749

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:04.226
YEAH AND IF I CAN -- MISTER SURE

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:06.729
LIKE TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS --

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:07.963
IS KIND OF INTRIGUING FOR ME IS

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.632
TO HEAR SOMEBODY SAY ABLE TO

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:10.700
ACKNOWLEDGE GONNA SELL PHILIP

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.134
SOME POINT IN TIME RIGHT.

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.402
SO THE QUESTION BUT FOR ME ONE

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.137
OF THE BEST PRACTICES -- THAT

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:17.640
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED BOTH FROM A

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:19.642
GOVERNMENT AGENCY STANDPOINT AND

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:22.211
FROM A PRESENT STANDPOINT.

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.046
AND IF YOU MIGHT ALSO JUST JUMP

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:24.980
IN ON SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:26.749
PIECES AND TELL ME WHAT ARE THE

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.884
MOST EFFECTIVE ONES -- THAT YOU

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:33.122
SEEN IN REACHING PEOPLE BASED ON

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:34.990
YOUR EXPERIENCE.

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.659
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:39.462
SO -- WHAT WERE THE BEST NEW

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:40.830
COMMUNITY IN RELATIONSHIP TO

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:41.764
TECHNOLOGY -- ONE OF THE BEST

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.431
PRACTICES IN GOVERNMENT AND BEST

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:43.666
PRACTICES FOR RESIDENT WHEN THIS

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.634
HAPPENS.

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.069
CLOSER THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:49.171
AND CERTAINLY IF I HAD THE THE

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:50.906
CORRECT ANSWER TO EVERY SINGLE

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.074
ONE OF THOSE WE PROBABLY WITH

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:52.641
THE NEED FOR THIS COMMITTEE

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:55.711
RIGHT -- THAT SAID -- WHAT I'M

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:59.315
HOPING TO CONVEY IS THAT THERE

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:01.117
IS NO ONE SINGLE?

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.885
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:05.855
CERTAINLY -- HAVING MULTIPLE

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.390
WAYS TO COMMUNICATE PEOPLE

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:08.591
INCLUDING THOSE ARE BASED IN

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:10.526
TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW THE WIRELESS

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.095
SOLAR SYSTEM I PAUSE SOCIAL

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:14.730
MEDIA TRADITIONAL MEDIA.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:16.799
I EVEN THE SIREN SYSTEMS IS A IS

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.401
A FORM OF TECHNOLOGY THAT --

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:20.102
DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES --

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:21.270
COULD WORK WELL IN OTHER

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:22.304
CIRCUMSTANCES NOT SO WELL AND

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:23.806
I'VE OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE TALK

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.141
ABOUT SIRENS IN.

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.009
AND I THINK SIRENS WORK IN

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.878
CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHEN

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.746
THEY WARN ABOUT ONE THREAT WITH

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:32.281
ONE RESPONSE WHEN YOU START

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:33.749
ADDING MULTIPLE THREATS MULTI

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.484
WERE SPONSORS IT BECOMES A LESS

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:36.886
EFFECTIVE SYSTEM LET'S LET'S

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:37.953
FIGURE SYSTEM.

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.489
BUT I SEE THAT A COME BACK TO

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.491
THIS WHOLE NOTION THAT -- I

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:43.993
THINK WE'RE MISSING PART OF THE

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:45.027
BOAT HERE IF WE FOCUS

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:49.331
EXCLUSIVELY ON GOVERNMENTS --

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:51.400
ROLL OR GOVERNMENTS --

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:53.402
CAPABILITIES OF WARNING PEOPLE

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.571
THROUGH -- THESEVARIOUS WARNING

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:57.139
SYSTEMS YOU HAVE TO HAVE.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:58.641
OTHER PLAYERS AT THE TABLE

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.176
WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE TO

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.010
PARTICIPATE AND CERTAINLY THAT

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:03.579
INCLUDES -- THOSE -- ENTITIES

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:05.414
THAT PROVIDE THE TECHNOLOGICAL

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:06.949
BASIS TO DO THE WARNING SYSTEM

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:07.950
THAT HAS IMPORTANT PART OF IT

01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:09.452
BUT IT COME BACK TO THE MEMBERS

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.220
OF THE COMMUNITY HAS TO BE PART

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:12.621
OF THIS AS WELL INDIVIDUALS HAVE

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.089
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:14.957
AND I THINK YOU'RE YOUR OWN

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.725
EXPERIENCE WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:17.560
INTRODUCTION.

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:19.428
WHEN YOU WENT OUT AND HELD

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:20.996
COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND I SUSPECT

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:21.831
THERE WAS A LOT OF OUR REACH

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.599
PARTY COMMITTEE MEETING ABOUT

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.301
SIGNING UP FOR THE VARIOUS MERCY

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:26.669
MASSIVELY KEY SYSTEMS?

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:28.370
BUT YOU YOU YOU READY TO PEOPLE

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:29.505
WHO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT WHO

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:30.473
DIDN'T WHO HAD SIGNED UP FOR IT.

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:31.907
THERE IS THIS SENSE OF APATHY

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.742
AND I THINK PROBLEMS SOMETIMES

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:34.410
WHEN.

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:36.479
WE BECOME SO DEPENDENT UPON

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.947
TECHNOLOGY IN KAY AND IN MANY

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:38.681
CASES DEPENDING ON THE

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:41.217
GOVERNMENT TO TELL US WHAT TO DO.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:49.525
AND TO WARN US ABOUT THINGS THAT --

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:51.360
WE ALMOST. FOR GO OUR OWN

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:52.294
RESPONSIBILITY OF MAKING SURE

THAT WE HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:53.562
KEEP OURSELVES SAFE AND I THINK

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:54.563
THAT'S GONNA BE PART OF IT

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.864
[inaudible]

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.365
MENTOR.

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:57.333
WE'LL SEE THE REASON I ASK THAT

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.468
QUESTION IS -- I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:00.903
THE HAS THE PERSON

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.505
RESPONSIBILITY ABSOLUTELY -- LET

IN YOUR BED IN YOUR EXPERIENCE

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.111
WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN DO.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.346
TO MAKE THIS IMPORTANT A

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.214
COMMUNITY OR NOT NECESSARILY YOU

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:12.982
BUT IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.149
BECAUSE WE FACE THE SAME

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.718
SITUATION KIND OF IN OUR AREA

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:17.286
WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.854
COMES IT BUT THERE'S CERTAIN.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:19.655
THERE'S CERTAIN LEG WORK TO GET

01:09:19.722 --> 01:09:21.223
DONE IN ADVANCE TO MAKE IT AN

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:22.825
IMPORTANT ISSUE WERE IT MAY NOT

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.159
BEEN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I'M

01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:25.327
NOT TAKING AWAY ASIDE FROM

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:26.529
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF AN

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.430
INDIVIDUAL BUT ARE THE THINGS

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.698
THAT WE CAN DO ARE THE THINGS

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:30.132
THAT.

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:31.400
WE HAVEN'T INVESTED IN OUR

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:32.568
THINGS IT WOULD BE A THAT ARE

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:33.936
WORKING THAT WE'RE DOING FOR

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:34.670
THAT YOU'RE DOING.

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:35.871
THAT HELPED TO MAKE THIS AN

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:37.506
IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR PEOPLE SO

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:38.707
THAT YOU'RE PREPARED TO HAVE

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.843
WATER I AM AN EX GAY PLAN YOU

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:41.977
YOU HAVE A FLASHLIGHT I'M ALL

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.045
THE BASIC THINGS RIGHT AWAY THE

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:44.547
THINGS THAT WE CAN PROMOTE.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.181
OR WERE THE BEST AVENUES OF BEST

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:51.520
PRACTICES IF YOU SEEN SO DOES

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.856
BECOME IMPORT.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:54.957
YES SIR I THINK OF A ROBUST

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.358
PUBLIC OUT REACHES BUSINESS PART

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.026
OF THAT WHOLE PLAN YOU GOTTA DO

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.894
YOU YOU'VE GOT TO BE PART OF

01:09:58.961 --> 01:09:59.995
THAT IS THAT IT HAS TO PARTY

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:00.195
PLAN.

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:05.935
I I THINK ALSO WE NEED TO START --

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.736
HAVING SOMETHING.

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:08.337
TO PERHAPS YOU KNOW WE TAKE IT

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:09.505
TO THE SCHOOLS AND WE START

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:10.039
TALKING ABOUT A MERCY FOR

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:10.873
PARENTS WITH A PREPAREDNESS WITH

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.541
OUR WITH OUR KIDS -- WE TAKE A

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:13.475
TOR SERVICE CLUBS WE TAKE A

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.143
DIVERSE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.312
WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE --

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.714
IN IN A STANDARDIZED PLAN AD

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.149
THEN THERE'S ALREADY AM I THINK

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:20.916
A MODEL FOR THAT THE RACE HAD

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:22.251
GROW FOR CO PROGRAM IS PART OF

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:22.618
THAT.

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:24.453
BUT WE HAVE A PLAN THAT WE CAN

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:24.987
REALLY START PUTTING TEIR

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.389
MISSION OUT AND CONVEYED IN

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:28.757
MULTIPLE WAYS YOU CAN.

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:29.325
YOU KNOW TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:31.360
RIGHT NOW IS A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:32.595
LOOK TO THAT A LOT OF LOOKS JUST

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:34.163
ME TO BUT MANY THAT MANY THE

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:35.898
MEMBERS ARE MANY THE MEMBERS A

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.099
COMMUNITY IN THE CAMP FIRE.

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:39.034
WERE ELDERLY PEOPLE AND FRANKLY

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:41.804
THEY DON'T TAP INTO SOCIAL MEDIA --

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.838
LIKE A LOT OF THE OTHER

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.006
GENERATIONS OF MEMBERS A

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.240
COMEDIAN SO WE MISSED THE BOAT

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:46.709
WITH REGARD TO THAT WE HAVE TO

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:47.977
FIND WAYS TO COMMUNICATE THAT

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:49.178
ACROSS MULTIPLE AND NOT TO

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:50.579
MENTION IT CAN IT CAN OFTEN BE

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.948
INFORMATION THAT IS NOT ACCURATE

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.150
OR INFORMATION THAT IS NOT --

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:58.587
NOT SOUND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:00.489
ABSOLUTELY THE OTHER THE OTHER

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:01.390
PIECE OF THE STUDENT AND WHY I

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:02.691
KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS NEED TO

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:03.859
INSPIRE.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:06.195
A MANAGE -- EXPECTATIONS OF A

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.963
COMMUNITIES AS INSPIRE THEM

ALL OF OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES WERE

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:24.013
JUST OVERWHELMED OUR DISPATCH

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:25.547
CENTER WAS OVERWHELMED HER FIRST

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:26.382
RESPONDERS OR WENT.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:27.549
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH POLICE

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.418
OFFICERS THAT WE SHARE SLOT FOR

THAT ENTITY IS FRONT HERE -- NOT

THE ISSUE OF SIRENS CAME UP COM

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:35.303

EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE AND I

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:45.480
THINK THAT THAT'S ONE ELEMENT

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:46.481
THAT WE NEED.

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:48.716

EARLIER PANELS HAVE DISCUSSES

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.870
THAT -- THE ONE OF THE VARIABLES

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.372
THAT IMPACTS -- THE ABILITY TO

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:14.642
PROPERLY ALERT RESIDENCES THE

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.010

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.945
WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.747
OTHER COMMUNICATIONS RIGHT --

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:21.783
THERE ARE FOR SURE MANY OTHERS

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:23.551
INCLUDING THE RELUCTANCE OF SOME

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.820

ALSO IN ONE OF THE PANELS.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.228

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:36.297
WANT TO SAY THAT VERIZON -- TO

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:38.232
AS EIGHTEEN T. MENTIONING GAUGES

01:30:38.299 --> 01:30:41.402
AND SIGNIFICANT EMERALD BUST --

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:42.904
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS BY

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:45.173
CREATING A RESILIENT NETWORK WE

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:46.440
DO HAVE WE DONE THE C. FEATURES

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:50.745
THAT INCLUDE RING CONFIGURATION --

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:51.746
WE ALSO -- PROVIDE BATTERY

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.614
BACKUP AND GENERATOR BACKUP

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:54.849
POWER TO VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:56.384
MACRO SITES.

01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:58.786
WHERE LOCAL BUILDING CODES IN

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.588
SPACE -- SPACING AVAILABILITY

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:02.456
ALLOWS IT VERIZON EQUIPS ITS

01:31:02.523 --> 01:31:04.192
MACRO SITES WITH GENERATORS THAT

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:07.295
HAVE -- TWENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:08.763
TWO HOURS OF BACKUP POWER.

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.731
THAT CAN BE REVIEW -- FOR MACRO

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:11.933
SITES THAT CANNOT HAVE

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:13.367
GENERATORS FOR A SLEW OF

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:15.670
DIFFERENT REGULATORY OR LEGAL

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:17.772
RESTRICTIONS -- WE DEPLOYED

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.974
BATTERY ARRAYS TO HAVE A MINIMUM

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:21.209
OF EIGHT HOURS OF BATTERY.

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:23.144
OF THAT BATTERY GETS DEPLETED

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:25.980
DURING A POWER SHUT OFF EITHER

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:28.983
BECAUSE OF A DISASTER OR BECAUSE

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:31.052
IT'S A PROACTIVE -- ONE WE HAVE

01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:32.153
THE ABILITY TO THEN DEPLOYED

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.821
GENERATORS WE HAVE SUFFICIENT

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:36.257
GENERATORS AND IN THOSE

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:38.726
SITUATIONS WHERE A GENERATOR IS

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.494
NOT WORKING PROPERLY WE ALSO CAN

01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:43.497
GO TO VENDORS AND AND GET

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:44.699
GENERATORS FROM VENDORS.

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:45.933
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS WE WERE

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:46.734
DISCUSSING THE BATTERY BACK UP

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:47.902
AND THERE WAS SOME

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.503
RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER ME

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:51.339
INCREASE BATTERY BACKUP -- AT

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:53.774
MACRO SITES THAT WE TAKE A STEP

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.343
BACK AND REMEMBER THAT THE

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:56.577
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:58.646
COMMISSION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

01:31:58.713 --> 01:31:59.981
SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FOR

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:01.616
TWO YEAR STUDY THE ISSUE OF

01:32:01.682 --> 01:32:02.984
BACKUP POWER.

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:05.586
THE ISSUE DATE THREE HUNDRED AND

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:06.087
THREE HUNDRED EIGHT PAGE

01:32:06.153 --> 01:32:08.956
RELIABILITY STANDARDS REPORT --

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:11.225
AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH A THIRD

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.327
PARTY CONSULTANT THAT THEY HAD

01:32:13.394 --> 01:32:14.762
CALLED TELCORDIA.

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:16.864
AND THAT OUR REPORT CONCLUDED

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:18.266
THAT THE REALITY IS THAT

01:32:18.332 --> 01:32:19.834
INCREASING BATTERY CAPACITY IN

01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.369
FUEL SUPPLIES AT NETWORK

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:22.403
FACILITIES.

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:24.772
WILL NOT PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:27.808
REDUCTION IN THE RISK DURING

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.577
MASS OF EVENTS THAT'S A COLD --

01:32:29.644 --> 01:32:31.913
SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTERS THEY

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:33.347
HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:37.218
COMMISSION FOR OVER A DECADE --

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:39.053
THE THAT STANDARD BUT THAT

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.788
RELIABILITY STANDARDS REPORT

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:44.625
FOUND THAT IN 2000888% OF

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:45.726
CALIFORNIA.

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:47.862
CELL SITES HAD BATTERY BACKUP

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:51.232
POWER OR BACKUP POWER IN ONE

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:52.266
MANNER OR ANOTHER.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.001
AND THAT'S A PERCENTAGE THAT

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:56.404
ALMOST -- IS SURELY HAS

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:58.439
INCREASED SINCE.

01:32:58.506 --> 01:32:58.906
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:00.274
RELIABILITY STANDARDS REPORT

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:03.477
RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS UNFORTUNATE

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:04.645
BUT INEVITABLE THAT

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:06.547
COMMUNICATIONS WILL BE SEVERELY

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:08.716
DISRUPTED DURING MASSIVE NATURAL.

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:10.351
DISASTERS.

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:13.020
AND THAT INCREASING BATTERY

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:15.623
CAPACITY OR FUEL SUPPLIES.

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:17.792
WILL NOT PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:21.162
REDUCTION IN RISK IN THESE

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:23.364
MASSIVELY BATHS.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:25.099
THE RELIABILITY STANDARDS REPORT

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.734
WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:29.670
DESTRUCTIVE NATURE NATURE OF THE

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:31.305
DISASTER EVENTS.

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:34.108
WILL DEFINITELY RESULT IN LOSS

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:36.177
OF COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES NOT

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:38.145
JUST WIRELESS FACILITIES.

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:39.613
AND GIVEN THAT FINDING IT

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.848
CONCLUDED THAT RATHER THAN

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:42.717
ENHANCE.

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:44.385
THE ALREADY EXISTING LEVEL OF

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:47.088
NETWORK FACILITIES REDUNDANCY.

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:49.957
THE FOCUS FOR RESILIENCY SHOULD

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.258
BE PLACED.

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:53.027
ON ROLL ROLL BUST NETWORK

01:33:53.094 --> 01:33:57.398
RECOVERY AND RESTORATION PLANS.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:58.866
SO UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:00.935
GOING TO HAVE OUTAGES -- EVEN

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:03.137
WITH A BACKUP POWER IN SOME

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:05.973
REDUNDANT -- FEATURES SUCH AS

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.943
RING CONFIGURATIONS -- AND WE

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.678
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AVERAGES

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.580
ARE FREQUENTLY NOT CAUSED BY

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:14.982
BACKUP POWER DEPLETION.

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:17.084
BUT RATHER THE DESTRUCTION OF

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:18.486
BACK CALL AND TRANSPORT

01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:22.089
FACILITIES ON BY OTHER PROVIDERS.

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:24.191
VERIZON'S RESPONSE UNNECESSARILY

01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:26.394
TURNS TO PLANNING FOR TEMPORARY

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.162
ASSETS AND THE USE OF TEMPORARY

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:30.131
ASSETS.

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:32.366
SO THIS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:33.167
AND I THINK WHEN YOU TAKE A

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:34.368
PAUSE ON IT IS.

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:36.203
THAT THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.272
NETWORK HAS BEEN DEPLOYED IN A

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:40.608
MANNER THAT IS COMPLEX -- AND

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:42.943
HAS MANY FEATURES AND IN TIRE

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:44.779
SORT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:46.781
NETWORK IS THAT WAY CELL TOWERS

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.849
ARE CELL TOWERS BUT THEY HAVE TO

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.451
HAVE BACK CALL THAT BACK HALL IS

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.953
NOT PROVIDED BY AT LEAST VERIZON

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:53.654
DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS OWN BACK

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:54.455
CALL.

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.223
IT LEASES THATFROM OTHER

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.626
COMPANIES SUCH AS EIGHTEEN T. OR

01:34:58.692 --> 01:34:59.693
THE CABLE COMPANIES ARE FRONT

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.461
TIER.

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.763
AND SUCH WHEN WE'VE WORKS

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:04.265
PERRANCE SAID OUT OF OUT AGES --

01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:06.500
IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE OF THE BACK

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:09.070
HALL PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:10.471
DESTRUCTION OF BACKHAUL SO

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:14.208
BATTERY BACKUP REALLY WAS NOT AN

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:16.010
ISSUE IN THOSE SITUATIONS.

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:16.610
WHEN THE NEED ARISES VERIZON

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:17.945
PROVIDES TEMPORARY ASSETS

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:19.346
SWELLING EXPEDITIONS IS IT'S

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:21.982
EXPEDITIOUSLY RESTORE SERVICE?

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:24.285
WE COLLABORATE CLOSELY WITH FEMA

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:25.653
WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL

01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:27.121
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICES

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:30.224
FIRST RESPONDERS. TO DEPLOY OUR

01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:32.193
TEMPORARY ASSETS WHERE THEY CAN

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:33.627
ACHIEVE.

01:35:33.694 --> 01:35:35.296
THE GREATEST IMPACT.

01:35:35.362 --> 01:35:37.465
DISASTER RESPONSE DECISIONS ARE

01:35:37.531 --> 01:35:39.567
ACTUALLY COMPLEX AND DO DEPEND

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:41.235
ON MANY FACTORS.

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:43.237
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A FAST

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:45.139
TAILORED AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:46.540
REALLY IS THE KEY.

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:48.109
SO WHEN WE ARE CALLED UPON TO

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:49.543
EMERGENCY WE REVIEW THE

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:51.145
SITUATION TO DETERMINE THE BEST

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:53.080
PATH FOR ENSURING.

01:35:53.147 --> 01:35:54.849
THAT APPROPRIATE SERVICE UNDER

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.851
THOSE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES IS

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.219
MADE AVAILABLE TO FIRST

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:00.154
RESPONDERS. TO PUBLIC SAFETY

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:02.957
ENTITIES AND COMMUNITY.

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.291
AMONG THE OTHER THINGS TO

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:06.961
VERIZON CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:08.596
CAREFULLY CONSIDERS TO SITE WERE

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:10.397
DEPLOYABLE UNITS WOULD ADDRESS

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:12.032
CAPACITY AND SOUND QUALITY

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:13.434
ISSUES.

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:16.070
AND OR WHETHER ANOTHER SOLUTION

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.538
IS MORE APPROPRIATE.

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:18.739
IN SOME CASES I THINK WE WANT

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:20.641
POTS ON THIS AND FOCUS ON THIS A

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:23.177
DEPLOYABLE MOBILE WIRELESS UNIT

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:24.945
COULD ACTUALLY DEGRADE.

01:36:25.012 --> 01:36:27.181
THE QUALITY OF SERVICE INSTEAD

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:28.115
OF ENHANCING IT.

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:30.017
BY INTERFERING WITH SERVICE FROM

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:32.319
PERMANENT FACILITIES THAT DO

01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:34.622
REMAIN OPERATIONAL.

01:36:34.688 --> 01:36:36.657
A TEMPORARY ACID AS ACTUALLY

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.626
UNNECESSARY MANY SITUATIONS

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:40.594
BECAUSE OF OUR EXISTING NETWORK

01:36:40.661 --> 01:36:41.529
FACILITIES.

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:42.897
THERE EITHER SUFFICIENT OR WE

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:44.265
CAN MODIFY THEM ON THE SPOT

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:47.568
FASTER THAN ACTUALLY DEPLOYING.

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:49.904
A TEMPORARY FACILITY.

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.739
SO WE WILL MODIFY AND CONFIGURE

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:53.174
EXISTING CELL SITES TO ADD

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.009
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO RESTORE

01:36:55.075 --> 01:36:56.477
IMPROVE SERVICE.

01:36:56.544 --> 01:36:58.112
INSTEAD OF MOVING TEMPORARY

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:03.083
UNITS TO A TO A PARTICULAR SITE.

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.151
WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE LABOR

01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:06.086
AGAIN REQUIRED TO CONFIGURE

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:08.122
EXISTING CELL SITES OFTEN ABOUT

01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:08.923
THE SAME AS THE TIME THAT WOULD

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:12.226
TAKE. FOR US TO GET A DEPLOYABLE

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.861
UNIT UP AND WORKING.

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:15.196
AND THIS HAS BEEN HELPFUL SO FOR

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:17.598
EXAMPLE DURING THE TWO THOUSAND

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:20.267
SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES WE DEPLOYED.

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:21.569
TWENTY NINE DEPLOYABLE ASSETS

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:23.704
ARE CONFIGURED AND MANY OTHER OF

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:25.506
OUR EXISTING CELL SITES.

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:28.943
SUCH THAT 97% OF OUR NETWORK WAS

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:31.078
OPERATING LIKE NORMAL IN THE

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:32.379
FIRST WEEK OF THE FIRES.

01:37:32.446 --> 01:37:35.282
AND 1100% OF THE NETWORK WAS

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:38.919
BACK TO NORMAL BY DAY.

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.721
SEVEN AND IN TWO THOUSAND

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:41.889
EIGHTEEN WE I HAVE MANY EXAMPLES

01:37:41.956 --> 01:37:43.757
I KNOW WE'RE SHORT ON TIME.

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.426

SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS?

01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:44.511
I THINK THERE HAS BEEN SOME

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:45.045
MISUNDERSTANDING THAT THAT

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:46.913

IS IS THAT A PERSON DOES IN FACT

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:12.572
GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.641
THE REVERSE NINE ONE ONE ALERT.

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:17.744
I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE

01:45:17.811 --> 01:45:20.714
SIMPLY THE DELIVERY PLATFORM.

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:22.382
WE DON'T DETERMINE WHEN THOSE

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:24.051
ALERTS ARE ISSUED WITHOUT

01:45:24.117 --> 01:45:26.219
DETERMINE WHAT THE MESSAGING AS

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:28.722
WE SIMPLY DELIVER.

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:30.957
THE CALL AS WE ARE ASKED TO DO

01:45:31.024 --> 01:45:32.359
EITHER DIRECTLY BY THE LOCAL

01:45:32.426 --> 01:45:33.460
GOVERNMENT OR THE THIRD PARTY

01:45:33.527 --> 01:45:37.631
ADMINISTRATOR THAT THEY MAY HAVE --

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:40.967
OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM FOR THEM.

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:42.936
CUSTOMERS ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY

01:45:43.003 --> 01:45:45.105
TO RECEIVE AN AIM ADD ADD ALERT

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:47.741
VIA EMAIL -- BUT THAT TOO WOULD

01:45:47.808 --> 01:45:49.042
REQUIRE THEM TO REGISTER WITH

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:50.711
LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEIR EMAIL

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:52.112
ADDRESS SO THAT THEY CAN IN FACT

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:53.847
RECEIVE THOSE NOTIFICATIONS BY

01:45:53.914 --> 01:45:55.749
EMAIL.

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:56.783
SO.

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:58.085
I WANT TO MOVE ON NOW AND TALK A

01:45:58.151 --> 01:46:00.087
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GUIDELINES

01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:02.122
THAT -- YES PUT TOGETHER FOR

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.790
LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- THERE'S A

01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:06.393
FEW AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.161
THE GUIDELINES ARE ACTUALLY IN

01:46:08.228 --> 01:46:09.963
NEED OF SOME CLARIFICATION --

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:11.531
THE GUIDELINES WERE ACTUALLY PUT

01:46:11.598 --> 01:46:13.033
OUT AND WE WERE ALLOWED TO VIEW

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.936
THAT ONCE THE DRAFT WAS OUT WE

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.104
DID PROVIDE TO ME M. PUT -- TO

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:18.338
YES WE DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS

01:46:18.405 --> 01:46:20.540
INCORPORATED HOWEVER WE DO NOT

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:21.875
BELIEVE THAT THE GUIDELINES ARE

01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:24.578
CLEAR AS TO WHAT THE ROLE OF THE

01:46:24.644 --> 01:46:26.046
VOID BIZ AND DELIVERING

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:27.414
EMERGENCY ALERTS.

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:28.915
WE DO BELIEVE THAT COULD BE

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:30.584
CLEARER IN THE GUIDELINES --

01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:31.852
THERE ARE ALSO PLACES IN THE

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:35.021
GUIDELINES WHERE THEY RECOMMEND

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:35.555
I AM.

01:46:35.622 --> 01:46:37.758
TRAINING ON THE CAPABILITIES A

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:38.959
CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY THEY

01:46:39.025 --> 01:46:40.360
SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THE

01:46:40.427 --> 01:46:42.562
INTERNET BUT WE WOULD SUGGEST

01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:44.097
THAT THAT TRAINING SHOULD APPLY

01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:45.232
ACROSS THE BOARD TO ALL

01:46:45.298 --> 01:46:47.300
PLATFORMS THAT MAY BE USED IN

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:48.702
THE DELIVERY OF AN EMERGENCY

01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:49.569
ALERT.

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:52.005
SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND -- THE

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:55.142
THE CAPABILITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:56.409
FOR EXAMPLE I WHAT I MENTIONED

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:57.744
EARLIER WITH REGARDS TO THE

01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:00.046
DELIVERY OF AN EMERGENCY ALERT

01:47:00.113 --> 01:47:01.281
OVER STREAMING VIDEO SERVICE

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:03.016
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:04.951
AND AND THE ISSUING AUTHORITY

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:07.220
SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT WHEN

01:47:07.287 --> 01:47:13.026
THEY ISSUE THAT ALERT.

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:13.794
THEY SHOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:14.327
THEY SHOULD BE TESTING THE

01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:15.562
SYSTEMS AT A TIME WE DON'T

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:17.230
BELIEVE THAT THAT EITHER IS

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:18.231
CLEAR.

01:47:18.298 --> 01:47:24.938
I'M IN THE ALERTS.

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:27.707
MOVING TO A GENERALIZATION.

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:29.409
SO BECAUSE THE CABLE SYSTEMS

01:47:29.476 --> 01:47:31.745
RELY ON ELECTRICITY TO OPERATE

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:33.146
OR VIDEO OR VOICE IN OUR

01:47:33.213 --> 01:47:35.882
INTERNET SYSTEMS WE ARE IMPACTED

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:37.117
WITH ELECTRICITY GOES OUT

01:47:37.184 --> 01:47:38.652
WHETHER IT'S DE ENERGIZED

01:47:38.718 --> 01:47:41.822
INTENTIONALLY OR OTHERWISE.

01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:43.557
THAT WOULD ALSO IMPACT THE

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:45.458
ABILITY OF OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE

01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:47.861
ALERTS. TO PREPARE FOR THE LOSS

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:49.696
OF POWER THAT CAN IMPACT THE

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:51.164
ABILITY TO TRANSMIT EMERGENCY

01:47:51.231 --> 01:47:53.500
NOTIFICATIONS CABLE OPERATORS.

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:55.836
DO IN FACT COMPLY WITH STATE AND

01:47:55.902 --> 01:47:57.571
FEDERAL LAWS TO OFFER OUR

01:47:57.637 --> 01:48:00.540
CUSTOMERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:48:00.607 --> 01:48:02.409
PURCHASE A BACKUP BATTERY --

01:48:02.475 --> 01:48:04.377
THOSE NOTIFICATIONS ARE PROVIDED

01:48:04.444 --> 01:48:06.746
TO THEM UPON THE INITIATION OF

01:48:06.813 --> 01:48:09.449
SERVICE AND THEY ARE THERE AFTER

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.852
PROVIDED TO THE KIDS CUSTOMER AT

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:15.989
ANNUALLY.

01:48:16.056 --> 01:48:17.557
THE BATTERY.

01:48:17.624 --> 01:48:19.292
IS EQUIPPED IN THE BATTERY

01:48:19.359 --> 01:48:21.528
PROVIDES ENOUGH ENERGY IN ORDER

01:48:21.595 --> 01:48:22.929
TO ALLOW THE VOICE SERVICE TO

01:48:22.996 --> 01:48:25.232
CONTINUE TO OPERATE. FOR EIGHT

01:48:25.298 --> 01:48:27.300
HOURS OR TWENTY FOUR HOURS

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:29.336
DEPENDING ON THE BATTERY CHARLES

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:32.806
AND BY BAY CUSTOMER.

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:34.975
SO WE ALSO HAVE BACKUP POWER

01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:36.543
THAT IS MAINTAINED AT KEY CABLE

01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:38.578
FACILITIES SUCH AS OUR HEAD INS

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:41.248
ARE HAVES ARE NOTES.

01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:43.550
AND WE DEPEND ON THAT BATTERY

01:48:43.617 --> 01:48:45.385
BACKUP IN ORDER TO KEEP THE

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:46.620
NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING THERE

01:48:46.686 --> 01:48:48.655
MAY BE TIMES WHERE WE ALSO HAVE

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:50.590
TO DEPEND ON GENERATORS TO KEEP

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:51.825
THE NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING.

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:53.293
BUT I WANT TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.795
GENERATORS IF YOU HAVE A PUBLIC

01:48:55.862 --> 01:48:58.999
SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF BECAUSE OF

01:48:59.065 --> 01:48:59.866
THE WIND.

01:48:59.933 --> 01:49:01.568
I THINK WE SHOULD THINK TWICE

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:04.471
ABOUT RENTING GENERATORS GAS

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:06.206
FIELD GENERATORS.

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:08.508
AND THOSE SAME CONDITIONS.

01:49:08.575 --> 01:49:10.844
I'M YOU DON'T WANT TO PERPETUATE

01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:13.113
THE PROBLEM OR SHIFT THE PROBLEM

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.080
I SHOULD SAY.

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:16.016
FROM A ONE INDUSTRY TO THE OTHER

01:49:16.082 --> 01:49:18.051
BY REQUIRING THE READING OF

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:19.653
GENERATORS AND WEATHER

01:49:19.719 --> 01:49:23.390
CONDITIONS THAT ARE NOT

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:24.991
CONDUCIVE TO SUCH.

01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:30.030
SO IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE.

01:49:30.096 --> 01:49:33.166
ADLER'S ADVERSELY IMPACT VARIOUS

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:35.735
SERVICES INCLUDING THE PLAIN OLD

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:37.470
TELEPHONE NETWORK THAT WE'VE ALL

01:49:37.537 --> 01:49:39.539
BECOME SO COMFORTABLE WITH

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:40.640
VENDOR.

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:41.741
WITH BELIEVING THAT IT'S ALWAYS

01:49:41.808 --> 01:49:44.344
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IF IN FACT

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:46.346
THE THE PHONE OPERATES WITH

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:48.682
ELECTRICITY AS MANY OF THEM DO

01:49:48.748 --> 01:49:49.783
THOSE OF US THAT STILL HAVE FONG

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:51.051
HOME PHONES PROBABLY HAVE THAT

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:52.319
PORTABLE PHONE.

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:53.353
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO WALK AWAY

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.055
FROM THE BASE THAT PORTABLE

01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:58.925
PHONE IS ALSO DEPENDED UPON

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:00.226
ELECTRICITY.

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:01.861
SO AND TO THE EXTENT THAT FEE

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:02.896
POWER GOES OUT ATTY CENTRAL

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:04.764
STATION OR REMOTE OFFICE THE

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:06.466
LAND LINE IS ALSO GOING TO BE

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:07.701
OUT.

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:09.903
SO WHAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT BACKUP

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.038
POWER HELPS ENSURE THAT THE

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:13.807
MESSAGES ARE DELIVERED.

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:15.608
THE EXTENT OF A DISASTER WILL

01:50:15.675 --> 01:50:16.943
DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT BACK AT

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:19.479
POWDER IS EFFICIENT OR WHATEVER

01:50:19.546 --> 01:50:21.548
THAT WORK HAS BEEN SEVERELY

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:24.084
DAMAGED IS MAKING AND MAKING AT

01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:26.586
NON SERVICEABLE AND TELL REPAIRS

01:50:26.653 --> 01:50:28.188
CAN BE COMPLETED.

01:50:28.254 --> 01:50:30.190
SO THE GUIDELINES THE YES

01:50:30.256 --> 01:50:31.191
GUIDELINE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:33.793
THERE MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:35.295
WHERE DISASTER DESTROYED ALL

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:36.997
COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRIC

01:50:37.063 --> 01:50:38.898
INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELIANCE ON

01:50:38.965 --> 01:50:41.434
OTHER TOOLS FOR EMERGENCY NOTICE?

01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:42.836
SUCH AS SIRENS AND MEGAPHONES AS

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:44.204
HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE EARLIER

01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:47.107
TODAY MAY BE NECESSARY.

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:49.376
SO THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:50.477

FOR US.

01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:36.209
ANOTHER PART OF OUR PROTOCOLS

TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT.

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:50.770
WELL ONE OF THE KEY ITEMS ON

LITTLE REACTION TIME.

01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:03.883
BETWEEN WHEN WE DE ENERGIZED AND

01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:05.785

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:07.220
DIE DOWN WE START TO GO INTO THE

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:08.755
INTO THE RE ENERGIZE ATION

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.823
PROCESS WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING IN

LOCATION LOGISTICALLY.

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:24.337
AND WE EXPEDITE ONCE THE WINTER

01:57:24.404 --> 01:57:26.606
DOWN WE'RE SURE AND ONCE WE ONCE

01:57:26.672 --> 01:57:29.375
WE PATROL IN SURE THAT IT'S SAFE

01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:30.843
WE RE ENERGIZE IN A TIMELY

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:32.578
MANNER AND WE CAN DO THAT PRETTY

01:57:32.645 --> 01:57:34.647
QUICKLY BECAUSE WE SO HIGHLY

01:57:34.714 --> 01:57:36.416
SEGMENTED OUR CIRCUITS.

01:57:36.482 --> 01:57:38.217
THAT WE CAN LIMIT TO SMALLER

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:40.253
AREAS AND RESTORE THE SMALL

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:42.221
AREAS FASTER THAN LARGER

01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:44.424
YOURSELF WE ONLY HAVE TO IMPACT

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.925
EIGHT PEOPLE ON A SEGMENTED

SERVICE QUICKER.

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:58.371
I THINK WHAT REALLY DOES IT FOR

01:57:58.438 --> 01:57:59.605
US THOUGH IS THE IS THE

01:57:59.672 --> 01:58:03.142

RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVERYBODY I

01:58:06.813 --> 01:58:08.080
CAN'T SAY ENOUGH FOR OUR

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:09.382
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THE CITY

OFFICERS THE DISPATCH CENTERS.

01:58:21.828 --> 01:58:22.929
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:24.063
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:58:24.130 --> 01:58:25.731

PRESENTS ITS OWN CHALLENGES AND

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.629
THE FACT THAT WHAT YOU DEAL WITH

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:18.864

AND THEN AT SOME POINT DOES IT

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:51.964
ACTUALLY MAKE MORE SENSE -- TO

02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:52.998
TO HAVE MORE OF THAT MOBILE

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:56.669
CAPABILITY THAN IT DOES -- YOU

WHICH OF THOSE TWO OR IS IT

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:01.173
SENATE KIND OF SOME COMBINATION

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.275
OF OF THOSE DEPENDING ON THE

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.649
REDUNDANCY.

THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- SO.

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:13.819
WHAT WE DIDN'T DISCUSS IS THE

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:15.888
FACT THAT -- THE MOBILE

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:17.556
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE ARE NOT

02:03:17.623 --> 02:03:18.824
JUST THE ONES WE HAVE IN

02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:19.992
CALIFORNIA WE CAN BRING OUR

02:03:20.059 --> 02:03:22.128
RESOURCES FROM OTHER PARTS OF

02:03:22.194 --> 02:03:23.929
THE NATION AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:26.665
DONE THAT -- IN THE IN RECENT

02:03:26.732 --> 02:03:29.535
FIRES WE BROUGHT -- MOBILE --

02:03:29.602 --> 02:03:31.036
DEPLOYABLE AS FROM OTHER --

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:33.105
STATES AND WHAT WHAT WE FOUND IS

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:36.075
THAT IT IT'S IT'S FINE YOU KNOW

02:03:36.142 --> 02:03:37.009
IT'S IT'S SOMETHING LONG AS WE

02:03:37.076 --> 02:03:38.144
GET THERE.

02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:39.645
AND WE HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:40.379
THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE A GREAT

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:42.114
RELATIONSHIP FOR CALLOW YES WE

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:43.249
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:46.485
THE MANY OF THE NOT ALL.

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:48.454
THE COUNTY ALL YES AND LOCAL YES

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.489
SO WHEN WE GO IN THERE AND TALK

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:51.924
TO THEM ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:53.259
WE CAN FIGURE OUT ALMOST

02:03:53.325 --> 02:03:54.693
IMMEDIATELY WHERE THERE IS A

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.028
SPECIFIC NEED.

02:03:56.095 --> 02:03:58.230
AND THEN DECIDE WHAT THE BEST

02:03:58.297 --> 02:03:59.665
WAY TO GO ABOUT THAT IS AND

02:03:59.732 --> 02:04:01.400
DEPLOYABLE IS NOT THE ONLY THING

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:02.601
THAT WE CAN DO.

02:04:02.668 --> 02:04:04.603
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ALREADY

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:06.405
HAVE CELL SITES UP THERE THAT

02:04:06.472 --> 02:04:07.807
MAY BE MODIFIED TO INCREASE

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:09.575
CAPACITY AND WE'VE DONE THAT

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:11.010
MANY TIMES OR WE'VE INCREASED

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:12.311
PASSIVE EXISTING.

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:14.680
CELL SITES TO DEAL WITH THE AND

02:04:14.747 --> 02:04:16.215
THE THE FACT THAT MAYBE ANOTHER

02:04:16.282 --> 02:04:19.385
CELL SITE HAS GONE DOWN BECAUSE

02:04:19.451 --> 02:04:21.086
FIBER HAS BEEN CUT OR FOR

02:04:21.153 --> 02:04:23.255
ANOTHER REASON.

02:04:23.322 --> 02:04:23.889
SO -- SO.

02:04:23.956 --> 02:04:25.524
WHAT WHAT WE LEARNED IS THAT WE

02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:27.193
NEED TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE UPON

02:04:27.259 --> 02:04:29.595
THOSE COMMUNICATIONS MAKE SURE

02:04:29.662 --> 02:04:30.396
THAT WE ARE?

02:04:30.462 --> 02:04:31.931
YOU KNOW -- NOT TALKING PAST

02:04:31.997 --> 02:04:33.465
EACH OTHER AND AND WE DON'T FIND

OVER THE OVER THE YEARS AND WHAT

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:38.330
WE LEARNED FROM THIS IS THAT WE

PERMIT GENERATOR AND WE WILL.

02:05:44.136 --> 02:05:44.870
NOT ALWAYS A SOLUTION WE'VE

02:05:44.937 --> 02:05:46.238
ADDED HUNDREDS OF PORTABLE

02:05:46.305 --> 02:05:48.007
GENERATORS TO OUR OUR FLEET AND

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:49.575
WE DEPLOY THOSE AND WE HAVE THE

02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:51.243
STAGE IN AREAS THAT ARE BEST SET

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:52.077
FOR THAT.

02:05:52.144 --> 02:05:53.178
WE PARTNER WITH OUR OTHER

02:05:53.245 --> 02:05:56.081
CARRIERS IN IN THE EVENT WE NEED.

02:05:56.148 --> 02:05:57.416

COORDINATOR FOR THE SOUTHERN

02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:00.486
CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY OPERATIONS.

WE HAVE DURING THE CAMPFIRE

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:03.455
SPECIFICALLY I MEAN I REMEMBER

02:06:03.522 --> 02:06:04.556
WORKING WITH RISE AND I WAS

02:06:04.623 --> 02:06:06.191

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:09.895
OUR OUR PRIMARY CONCERN.

02:06:09.962 --> 02:06:11.530
BUT THERE IS A ONE SOLUTION

02:06:11.597 --> 02:06:12.798
RIGHT BUILDING RESILIENT NETWORK

02:06:12.865 --> 02:06:15.334

ALL THE ALERTS ON TOP OF THAT I

02:06:22.041 --> 02:06:23.309
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MIXED

02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:27.146
BAG THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:27.346
BEST.

CHALLENGES THAT.

02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:32.151
PREVENT YOU.

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:34.119
OPTIMALLY DOING THIS SYSTEM

02:06:34.186 --> 02:06:36.055
RESILIENCY RIGHT NOW IS THERE

02:06:36.121 --> 02:06:37.389
ANYTHING THE STATE IS DOING THAT

02:06:37.456 --> 02:06:39.024
GETTING IN THE WAY OF WHERE WE

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.192
NEED TO BE TO KEEP.

02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:42.661
RESIDENTS SAFE [inaudible]

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:48.233
THE I WOULDN'T THINK SO I I I

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:50.336
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT --

02:06:50.402 --> 02:06:53.105
THE THE DATE AND I REALLY

02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:54.907
APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT MADAM CHAIR --

HEARING AGAIN WE KIND OF TALKED

02:06:57.943 --> 02:06:59.678
ABOUT COLLABORATION -- I THINK

COLLAB IT ANYTHING IN THIS AREA

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:02.848

WITH EACH OTHER.

02:07:12.992 --> 02:07:14.760
RATHER THAN THAT EACH OTHER

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:16.428
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY I THINK

02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:18.597

AND WHAT WE CAN WHAT WECAN DO

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:35.748
BETTER ONE OF THE THINGS

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:37.282
UNFORTUNATELY AND WHAT WE'RE

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:41.220
HEARING TODAY -- WAS -- IN THE

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:42.621
RURAL AREAS.

02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:43.689
IT'S NOT SO MUCH A STATE ISSUE

02:07:43.756 --> 02:07:45.524
IT'S SORT OF A LOCAL ISSUE.

02:07:45.591 --> 02:07:46.492
PROBABLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ORE

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:47.960
SITES IN CERTAIN PLACES THAT ARE

02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:50.262
VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO TO DO.

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:51.630
A IN SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:52.998
AREAS LIKE THAT.

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:55.167
PUBLIC LANDS AND AND SOME OF THE

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:56.935
RURAL AREAS OF REALLY HARD.

02:07:57.002 --> 02:07:58.704
TO THE SITE TO SITE

02:07:58.771 --> 02:07:59.204
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:02.941
NOT IF I CAN ADD -- AS AS HE WAS

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:06.512
TALKING IDEAS ACTUALLY FLOWED SO --

02:08:06.578 --> 02:08:08.147
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

02:08:08.213 --> 02:08:10.082
THAT WE HAVE IS THE DEPLOYMENT

02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:14.186
OF OUR FACILITIES -- IN IN

02:08:14.253 --> 02:08:17.056
PLACES WHERE THE A CONDITIONAL

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:19.625
USE PERMIT PROCESS SEEN IS

02:08:19.691 --> 02:08:20.859
COMPLICATED THAT THAT'S A LOCAL

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:22.361
ISSUE ISSUE IT'S NOT A STATE

02:08:22.428 --> 02:08:24.863
ISSUE BUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:27.232
GET THE PERMITS FOR A MACRO

02:08:27.299 --> 02:08:29.268
TOWER -- OR OTHER WIRELESS

02:08:29.334 --> 02:08:32.137
FACILITY SOMETIMES CAN BE TWO

02:08:32.204 --> 02:08:34.073
THREE YEARS MAYBE EVEN LONGER --

02:08:34.139 --> 02:08:35.574
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE COMMUNITY

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:38.477
OPPOSITION AND YOU HAVE AN M. P.

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:40.779
ISM NOT IN MY BACKYARD -- THEN

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:42.981
DID THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT

02:08:43.048 --> 02:08:44.383
FOR US TO ACTUALLY CREATE THE

02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:45.884
TYPE OF REDUNDANCIES THAT WE

02:08:45.951 --> 02:08:47.453
WANT TO OUR MORE ROBUST

02:08:47.519 --> 02:08:50.689
COMMUNICATIONS -- NETWORK --

02:08:50.756 --> 02:08:52.491
THIS IS SOMETHING ALL OF US

02:08:52.558 --> 02:08:56.462
EXPERIENCE AND Là ARE GIVE YOU.

02:08:56.528 --> 02:08:58.063
ONE EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE

02:08:58.130 --> 02:09:00.265
DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE IN IT AND

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:01.800
IT DOESN'T REALLY.

02:09:01.867 --> 02:09:03.936
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO

02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:04.536
STAY CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT

02:09:04.603 --> 02:09:06.872
BUT NO ONE WE WANT TO PUT UP A

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:09.274
MACRO -- WE NEED TO GO FIND A

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:11.043
LOCATION TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:12.077
ENSURE A LEASE WITH THE

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:13.545
LANDOWNER TO DO THAT AND THEN

02:09:13.612 --> 02:09:14.780
GET THE PERMITTING THEN

02:09:14.847 --> 02:09:18.150
CONSTRUCTED -- WE HAVE DELAYS

02:09:18.217 --> 02:09:19.818
BECAUSE SOME LANDOWNERS WILL

02:09:19.885 --> 02:09:21.620
ENTER CONTRACTS WITH US AND THEN

02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:22.788
BACK OUT -- YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:25.791
LATER SO THAT ADDS TO THE TIMING.

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:26.725
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:28.293
CONCERNS THAT THAT I CAN DISCUSS

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:31.864

02:10:00.559 --> 02:10:01.693
LIMITATIONS ON WHEN WE CAN DO

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:02.728

02:12:38.283 --> 02:12:40.485
WAS FAIRLY WELL COVERED.

02:12:40.552 --> 02:12:43.355
IN THE IT VANCE PAPERS THAT WERE

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:45.424
DONE HERE SO I WOULD LIKE TO

02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:47.125
JUST GET RIGHT TO THE CHASE FOR

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:48.327
TRUST A COUPLE MINUTES BECAUSE I

02:12:48.393 --> 02:12:49.628
REALIZE IT'S LATE AND WE HAVE

02:12:49.695 --> 02:12:50.562
PUBLIC.

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:53.365
COMMENT COMING AS WELL.

02:12:53.432 --> 02:12:55.434
INDEED THE CHAIR LEAVE THIS YEAR

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:58.704
APPOINTMENTS OKAY SO.

02:12:58.770 --> 02:13:01.039
THAT'S A THAT'S A YEAH A HINT

02:13:01.106 --> 02:13:06.244
THAT WE SHOULD BE WINDING DOWN --

02:13:06.311 --> 02:13:08.013
ON THE ON THE REDUNDANCY OF OUR

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:09.681
ALERT SYSTEMS -- IT WAS SO I

02:13:09.748 --> 02:13:10.982
THINK TWO YEARS AGO -- IN

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:13.251
DECEMBER WHERE -- WE HAD A

02:13:13.318 --> 02:13:14.486
HEARING IN THIS ROOM VERY

02:13:14.553 --> 02:13:16.121
SIMILAR TO THIS ONE TALKING

02:13:16.188 --> 02:13:18.824
ABOUT EMERGENCY ALERTS AND

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:20.726
EVACUATIONS AND WE HAD HAD THE

02:13:20.792 --> 02:13:22.194
FIRES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:24.129
THE KILLED I THINK THIS FORTY

02:13:24.196 --> 02:13:24.963
FOUR PEOPLE.

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:28.400
OF THE CAR FIRE IN IN IN THE

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:31.036
COFFEE PARK IN SANTA ROSA AND IT

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:34.406
WAS CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE.

02:13:34.473 --> 02:13:36.241
UNNECESSARY JOB IN WARNING

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:38.009
PEOPLE BECAUSE THE FIRST OUR

02:13:38.076 --> 02:13:41.279
FIRST PRIORITY NOT TRUSTED IN.

02:13:41.346 --> 02:13:43.915
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUT FOR YOU

02:13:43.982 --> 02:13:45.951
FOLKS WHO ARE THE ONES WHO

02:13:46.017 --> 02:13:47.986
PROVIDE THESE COMMUNICATIONS

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:49.721
SERVICES AND DO THE WORK TO

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:50.622
COORDINATE NIGHT.

02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:51.823
AND I DO AGREE THAT

02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:53.759
RELATIONSHIPS ARE CRITICAL IN

02:13:53.825 --> 02:13:55.193
COORDINATING EFFORTS ARE

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:56.828
IMPORTANT BUT YOU'RE THE FOLKS

02:13:56.895 --> 02:13:58.597
OUT THERE WHO HAVE THOUGH THE

02:13:58.663 --> 02:14:00.999
HARDWARE -- THE FOLKS THAT DO

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:03.969
THE ALERTS AND MOST PEOPLE I

02:14:04.035 --> 02:14:05.570
KNOW TODAY DO NOT HAVE LAND

02:14:05.637 --> 02:14:06.705
LINES.

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:08.407
AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW

02:14:08.473 --> 02:14:10.776
CAN WE MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW TO

02:14:10.842 --> 02:14:12.310
GET OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

02:14:12.377 --> 02:14:14.813
AND TO BRING IN MOBILE UNITS IS

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.214
GREAT BUT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:18.049
COME IN BEFORE THE FIRE STARTS

02:14:18.116 --> 02:14:19.785
RAVAGING THROUGH A COMMUNITY YOU

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:23.422
MIGHT GET A MINUTE DAY OR TWO

02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:24.289
LATER.

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:26.057
BUT WHEN THAT FIRE STARTS.

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:27.659
AND AN HOUR AND A HALF LEFT

02:14:27.726 --> 02:14:29.661
AFTER A BANG DOWN THAT GAVELED

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:31.396
TO DISCUSSES ISSUES DECEMBER

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:32.831
FOURTH AND I REMEMBER SAYING

02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:35.033
WELSH DECEMBER HOPEFULLY WILL

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:35.634
HAVE MORE TIME TO FIGURE THIS

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:36.468
OUT.

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:39.037
LITERALLY AN HOUR AND A HALF

02:14:39.104 --> 02:14:40.639
LATER THE THOMAS FIRE STARTED.

02:14:40.705 --> 02:14:41.773
AND IN MY DISTRICT EVERY OUNCE

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:44.242
OF THAT FIRE. FORTY DAYS SAID

02:14:44.309 --> 02:14:47.179
FIRE BURNED AND IT MOVED ACROSS.

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:48.713
THE COMMUNITY ACROSS VENTURA

02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:50.482
COUNTY AND IT ENDED UP BEING

02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:52.150
PUSHED INTO THE BACK COUNTRY ONE

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:53.785
MILE FROM MY HOUSE.

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:55.320
SO I HAD A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

02:14:55.387 --> 02:14:57.355
WITH THIS AS WELL AS TRYING TO

02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:58.423
DEAL WITH THIS FROM WORKING WITH --

02:14:58.490 --> 02:15:01.359
YES IT DID AN AMAZING JOB AND

02:15:01.426 --> 02:15:01.960
AND ALL THE OTHER GROUPS WHO

02:15:02.027 --> 02:15:02.828
CAME TOGETHER.

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:05.163
BUT OUR ALERT SYSTEM IS NOT

02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:06.331
ADEQUATE.

02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:08.834
AND WE KNOW WHEN THESE FIRE

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.101
START.

02:15:10.168 --> 02:15:11.002
UP IN THE HILLS AS MOST OF THEM

02:15:11.069 --> 02:15:11.903
DO.

02:15:11.970 --> 02:15:15.640
IT IS A IT IS A A A TELEPHONE

02:15:15.707 --> 02:15:16.675
POLE.

02:15:16.741 --> 02:15:18.977
THAT FALLS TO THE WINDOW OR

02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:20.679
CAPTURES ON FIRE AND THEN

02:15:20.745 --> 02:15:22.347
EVERYTHING RACES FROM THERE AND

02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:24.549
ON THOSE POLLS ARE FREQUENTLY

02:15:24.616 --> 02:15:26.351
WIRELESS EQUIPMENT SO THE

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:28.286
WIRELESS SYSTEM GOES DOWN SO THE

02:15:28.353 --> 02:15:29.387
QUESTION BECOMES.

02:15:29.454 --> 02:15:30.689
HOW OUR PEOPLE IF THE

02:15:30.755 --> 02:15:32.891
ELECTRICITY SO IF THE WIRELESS

02:15:32.958 --> 02:15:34.626
SYSTEM GOES OUT HOW ARE PEOPLE

02:15:34.693 --> 02:15:36.695
GOING TO KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO

02:15:36.761 --> 02:15:38.497

THE MOBILE UNITS TO COME IN A

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:47.339
DAY OR TWO LATER.

02:15:47.405 --> 02:15:49.074

HERE BUT A LOT OF TIMES -- WE

02:17:00.412 --> 02:17:01.813
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE OUIJA

02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:03.815
SYSTEM IS USED IN A TIMELY

02:17:03.882 --> 02:17:05.116
ENOUGH FASHION BEFORE THINGS GO

02:17:05.183 --> 02:17:06.551

THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND IT'S UP

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:14.659
TO LOCAL ORIGINATORS. TO DECIDE

02:17:14.726 --> 02:17:16.161
WHETHER OR NOT TO DO A OF

02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:19.097
WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT -- THEY

02:17:19.164 --> 02:17:21.299
DETERMINE THE MESSAGE.

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:22.267
THEY DETERMINE THE AREA.

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:24.102
AND THEN.

02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:25.804

THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE

02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:31.509
TO DO IS WORK COLLECTIVELY TO

02:17:31.576 --> 02:17:32.877
MAKE SURE AND MORE LOCAL

02:17:32.944 --> 02:17:34.346
ORIGINATORS WHICH ARE LOCAL

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.289
ENTIRE NETWORK GOES DOWN.

02:17:44.356 --> 02:17:45.457
YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I THINK THE

02:17:45.523 --> 02:17:46.725
CARRIERS ARE ALSO DOING A GOOD

02:17:46.791 --> 02:17:49.294
JOB OF IT JUST BECAUSE ONE SIDE

02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:49.995
GOES DOWN DOESN'T MEAN THEY

02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:52.931
CAN'T RE DIRECT TRAFFIC YOU KNOW

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:55.533
ELSEWHERE -- I DO THINK THE

02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:57.235
COMPANIES ARE DOING IT AT A VERY

02:17:57.302 --> 02:17:58.637

THE THINGS THAT ARE DONE IN

02:18:05.877 --> 02:18:07.912
ANTICIPATION OF I MEAN.

02:18:07.979 --> 02:18:09.080
YOU KIND OF KNOW WHAT'S COMING

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:10.382
RIGHT I MEAN THAT ALTHOUGH

02:18:10.448 --> 02:18:11.750
SOMETIMES THEY HAPPEN VERY VERY

02:18:11.816 --> 02:18:12.884
QUICKLY [inaudible]

02:18:12.951 --> 02:18:14.352
SO.

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:17.589
COLLABORATING WITH WITH -- YES --

02:18:17.656 --> 02:18:20.492
WITH LOCAL ORIGINATORS -- IN IN

02:18:20.558 --> 02:18:23.728
IT AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK BACK. TO

02:18:23.795 --> 02:18:25.664
TO SEE HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE BUT I

02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:27.432
THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS IS

02:18:27.499 --> 02:18:28.867
ALL LOOK FORWARD TO SEE WHAT WE

02:18:28.933 --> 02:18:30.335
CAN DO TO MAKE IT TO MAKE IT

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:31.336
BETTER WELL I'M INTERESTED IN

02:18:31.403 --> 02:18:33.672
THAT OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T GO

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:34.439
BACKWARDS BUT IF YOU WOULD.

02:18:34.506 --> 02:18:36.608
ADDRESS THE QUESTION.

02:18:36.675 --> 02:18:39.444
YOU HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE ON

02:18:39.511 --> 02:18:42.580
TELEPHONE POLES IN RURAL AREAS

02:18:42.647 --> 02:18:45.283
OR IN THE HILLS -- SUBJECT TO

02:18:45.350 --> 02:18:48.353
ENORMOUS WINS SUBJECT TO

02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:50.221
COLLAPSING AND IT WHEN THAT

02:18:50.288 --> 02:18:53.291
HAPPENS THE EVERYTHING GOES OUT.

02:18:53.358 --> 02:18:55.560
SO -- GRANTED YOU CAN YOU CAN --

02:18:55.627 --> 02:18:58.029
WE HAVE LOCAL ORIGINATORS TO

02:18:58.096 --> 02:18:59.798
DETERMINE THE MESSAGE AN AREA

02:18:59.864 --> 02:19:01.900
BUT IF THERE'S NO INFRASTRUCTURE

02:19:01.966 --> 02:19:03.968
TO DELIVER IT IT DOESN'T MATTER

02:19:04.035 --> 02:19:06.504
SO WE CAN WORK ON AND I THINK

02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:08.506
WE'RE SEEING THAT LOCALLY -- I'M

02:19:08.573 --> 02:19:10.241
VERY INTERESTED IN HOW TO MAKE

02:19:10.308 --> 02:19:11.609
SURE THAT THESE DIFFERENT

02:19:11.676 --> 02:19:12.944
WARNING SYSTEMS THAT ARE

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:14.546
DELIVERED THROUGH WIRELESS I GOT

02:19:14.612 --> 02:19:15.747
WANTED TO THIRTY IN THE WARM

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:17.015
MORNING FROM WE HAD DURING OUR

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:18.850
FIRE DID KNOW QUITE WHAT TO MAKE

02:19:18.917 --> 02:19:20.452
OF IT AND TURNED OUT THEY WERE

02:19:20.518 --> 02:19:22.287
CONCERNED ABOUT EVERY TEN MILES.

02:19:22.353 --> 02:19:25.056
AWAY SO DIDN'T HELP VERY MUCH

02:19:25.123 --> 02:19:26.391
THERE HAVE TO BE A NUMBER OF

02:19:26.458 --> 02:19:28.727
SYSTEMS AND BECAUSE WIRELESS NOW

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:31.996
IT IS TODAY THE PRIMERA WAY THAT

02:19:32.063 --> 02:19:33.765
PEOPLE COMMUNICATE.

02:19:33.832 --> 02:19:35.900
OR BY INTERNET TO WHICH MANY OF

02:19:35.967 --> 02:19:37.135
WHICH ARE YOU KNOW DONE THROUGH

02:19:37.202 --> 02:19:39.070
WIRES AND CABLES AND ALL.

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:40.271
WHAT IS IT?

02:19:40.338 --> 02:19:42.774
THAT THAT YOU MAY NEED OR THAT

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:45.443
YOU'RE WILLING TO DO -- WE WE

02:19:45.510 --> 02:19:47.312
CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE LOCALS

02:19:47.378 --> 02:19:49.214
AND SAY YOU GOT A MOVE FASTER

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.182
THEY CAN'T MOVE FASTER IF THE

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.083
INFRASTRUCTURE ISN'T THERE

02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:53.718
THAT'S YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:19:53.785 --> 02:19:57.122
WHAT CAN WE DO GOING FORWARD? TO

02:19:57.188 --> 02:19:59.858
ASSIST YOU IN ASSURING THAT THE

02:19:59.924 --> 02:20:02.727
INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE AND IT'S

02:20:02.794 --> 02:20:03.862
FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO

02:20:03.928 --> 02:20:05.130
BE FUNCTIONAL.

02:20:05.196 --> 02:20:06.698
AND IT'S RIGHT UP THERE USUALLY

02:20:06.765 --> 02:20:09.467
IN THE IN THE RISKIEST AREAS --

02:20:09.534 --> 02:20:15.306
BUT IT'S GOT TO WORK.

02:20:15.373 --> 02:20:16.174
WHEN PEOPLE DIE OR THEY ARE

02:20:16.241 --> 02:20:17.242
TRAUMATIZED BY THIS -- THIS

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:18.376
EXPERIENCE IT DOESN'T HELP TO

02:20:18.443 --> 02:20:20.745
SAY WELL YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM

02:20:20.812 --> 02:20:24.149
WENT OUT IT WAS UP IN THE HILLS.

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:25.517
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH STUFF IS.

02:20:25.583 --> 02:20:26.951
THE STUFF ON TELEPHONE POLES ARE

02:20:27.018 --> 02:20:28.353
GENERALLY THE MICRO THE TINY

02:20:28.419 --> 02:20:29.721
LITTLE THINGS BUT MOST OF THE

02:20:29.788 --> 02:20:31.656
WIRELESS NETWORK IS ON THE MACRO

02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:33.725
TOWERS CORRECT TODD FINE AND

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:35.727
WHERE THE MACRO TOWERS.

02:20:35.794 --> 02:20:36.961
I'M SORRY WHERE ARE THE MAC

02:20:37.028 --> 02:20:38.296
FORGET WHERE THEY LOCATED ORDER

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:39.631
THE LARGER STILL TOWERS THAT

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:40.932
YOU'D SEE GENERALLY THROUGHOUT

02:20:40.999 --> 02:20:41.833
THE AREA SO THEY'RE NOT

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:43.301
GENERALLY PLACED ON TELEPHONE

02:20:43.368 --> 02:20:44.969
POLES THE MACRO SIDE SORRY FINE

02:20:45.036 --> 02:20:46.137
BUT THEY ARE IN THE HILLS SO

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:47.105
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE USUALLY.

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:48.072
BUT THEY ARE A WE HAVE

02:20:48.139 --> 02:20:49.974
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND THOSE WE

02:20:50.041 --> 02:20:52.243
HAVE RESILIENCY IN REDUNDANCY IN

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:53.311
THE NETWORK AS WELL WITH BACKUP

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:56.815
OF POWER SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE

02:20:56.881 --> 02:20:58.283
MACROS FOR ALL MICROSITES.

02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:59.317
IN IN THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:00.218
YOU'VE HAD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

02:21:00.285 --> 02:21:02.187
THAT'S CORRECT OUR MACRO SITES

02:21:02.253 --> 02:21:04.622
ALL HAVE REDUNDANT POWER -- SOME

02:21:04.689 --> 02:21:05.456
REMARKS WHICH HAVE REDUNDANT

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:06.257
POWER.

02:21:06.324 --> 02:21:08.259
AND WHEN YOU SAY MACROS SITES

02:21:08.326 --> 02:21:09.260
FOR THOSE THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:10.962
THIS IS A LARGE POLLS YOU'D SEE

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:11.963
WITH IS WITH THE TOWERS ON TOP

02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:13.765
OF THE NOT -- SMALLER SO WE CALL

02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:15.433
MICROSITES WOULD BE ON A

02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:17.135
TELEPHONE POLE OF FOR THE NEXT

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:19.204
NEXT GEN TYPE OF CELL SERVICE

02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.838
BUT THE MACRO SIDES OF THE MAIN

02:21:19.904 --> 02:21:20.605
ONES YOU'D SEE THROUGH SO YOU

02:21:20.672 --> 02:21:21.906
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:24.142
THAT OU NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE

02:21:24.209 --> 02:21:25.910
YOUR SYSTEM -- BUT I'D SAY IS

02:21:25.977 --> 02:21:27.378
THAT WE WE'VE BUILT A NETWORK

02:21:27.445 --> 02:21:28.780
WITH MANY LEVELS OF DIVERSITY

02:21:28.847 --> 02:21:30.215
CONTINUE LOOKING OF THERE'S

02:21:30.281 --> 02:21:32.250
OPPORTUNITIES CLEARLY BASED ON

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:33.751
THE EVIDENCE WEEKS WE'VE HEARD

02:21:33.818 --> 02:21:35.720
TODAY RIGHT -- BUT WE CAN'T WE

02:21:35.787 --> 02:21:37.255
WE DECIDED TO STAND MULTIPLE

02:21:37.322 --> 02:21:39.791
POINTS OF FAILURE BUT WE CAN'T

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:41.259
DESIGN A NETWORK THAT'S

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:47.165
IMPOSSIBLE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THE

02:21:47.232 --> 02:21:48.633
ENGINEER NETWORK.

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:49.200
WITH INSURANCE THAT WILL NOT

02:21:49.267 --> 02:21:50.869
BURKE. FOR INSTANCE IN THE

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:52.070
CAMPFIRE WITH MARK FIRE MOVES SO

02:21:52.136 --> 02:21:53.471
FAST AND SO QUICKLY IT IMPACTED

02:21:53.538 --> 02:21:54.472
BOTH ARE DONE THE LINES IN THE

02:21:54.539 --> 02:21:54.873
AREA.

02:21:54.939 --> 02:21:55.540
SO WHAT WE COULD DO IS WE COULD

02:21:55.607 --> 02:21:57.275
GET A SATELLITE COLD IN THERE AS

02:21:57.342 --> 02:21:58.176
QUICKLY AS WE CAN ACCESS THE

02:21:58.243 --> 02:22:00.245
AREA WHICH RESTORED SERVICES

02:22:00.311 --> 02:22:01.646
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

02:22:01.713 --> 02:22:02.914
SO I AM AND WHAT I WOULD

02:22:02.981 --> 02:22:03.915
ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE

02:22:03.982 --> 02:22:05.350
IT'S IT'S NOT AN EASY ANSWER AND

02:22:05.416 --> 02:22:06.918
I I THINK I SENT IT TO THE CHAIR

02:22:06.985 --> 02:22:09.087
THERE -- THERE IS NO SINGLE

02:22:09.153 --> 02:22:10.421
LEARNING SOLUTION FOR ALL

02:22:10.488 --> 02:22:11.923
SCENARIOS.

02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.857
WOULD RATHER SEE A SUITE OF

02:22:12.924 --> 02:22:14.292
SOLUTIONS THAT I THINK WE NEED

02:22:14.359 --> 02:22:17.395
TO EMLOY RIGHT INCLUDING WE ARE --

02:22:17.462 --> 02:22:18.997
WHAT'S THE KHôNG RIVERSIDE ONE

02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:21.366
ONE TV AND RADIO AND EVEN OFTEN

02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:22.467
MOBILE ALERTS.

02:22:22.533 --> 02:22:23.501
AND WHILE WE DON'T MANAGE THE

02:22:23.568 --> 02:22:27.972
SOLUTIONS WE DO BUILD A STRONG

02:22:28.039 --> 02:22:28.606
AND RESILIENT NETWORKS THAT CAN

02:22:28.673 --> 02:22:28.940
DELIVER THEM.

02:22:29.007 --> 02:22:30.241
AND THAT'S THAT'S OUR GOAL.

02:22:30.308 --> 02:22:31.876
WELL I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS ON

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:33.511
THIS -- APPRECIATE YOUR BEING

02:22:33.578 --> 02:22:36.514
HERE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:38.082
THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE

02:22:38.149 --> 02:22:39.784
THIS WEEK WE JUST CAN'T BE

02:22:39.851 --> 02:22:42.086
SATISFIED WITH WHERE WE ARE WE

02:22:42.153 --> 02:22:43.488
KNOW THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW MORE

02:22:43.554 --> 02:22:45.156
DISASTERS THE COMMON I WILL TELL

02:22:45.223 --> 02:22:45.924
YOU.

02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:47.191
UP FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY

02:22:47.258 --> 02:22:48.726
COMMUNITY WHO SPENT FORTY DAYS

02:22:48.793 --> 02:22:50.261
WONDERING WHETHER THIS FIRE WAS

02:22:50.328 --> 02:22:51.329
GOING TO TAKE OUT THE ENTIRE

02:22:51.396 --> 02:22:52.830
CITY SANTA BARBARA WHICH WAS A

02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:54.065
POSSIBILITY.

02:22:54.132 --> 02:22:55.633
OF THE ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.135
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF

02:22:57.201 --> 02:22:58.770
PEOPLE I KNOW ARE STILL

02:22:58.836 --> 02:23:00.438
EXPERIENCING TO THIS VERY DAY.

02:23:00.505 --> 02:23:02.173
SO WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE WE'VE

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:03.007
GOT TO DO IT BETTER.

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:04.676
AND WE NEED TO TO BE

02:23:04.742 --> 02:23:06.311
PARTICIPATING WITH US SO I'M

02:23:06.377 --> 02:23:07.211
SURE WILL CONTINUE THOSE

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:09.247
CONVERSATIONS AND AND HOPE THAT

02:23:09.314 --> 02:23:10.648
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:23:10.715 --> 02:23:12.216
IMPORTANT TO YOU AS WELL.

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:14.385
SO WITH THAT I I THANK YOU ANY

02:23:14.452 --> 02:23:16.120
OTHER I GUESS IT'S JUST ME

MYSELF AND ME -- SO THANK YOU

02:23:18.156 --> 02:23:19.424
ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE IN

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:20.892
THE AND THIS WILL CONTINUE AND I

02:23:20.959 --> 02:23:26.564
THINK NOW WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT UP.

02:23:26.631 --> 02:23:28.499
FOR YES YES WE'RE GONNA PEN IT

02:23:28.566 --> 02:23:30.001
UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF WE

02:23:30.068 --> 02:23:32.036
COULD HAVE SOME PEOPLE IF YOU

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:32.570
HAD IF THERE IS ANY PUBLIC

02:23:32.637 --> 02:23:34.439
COMMENT.

02:23:34.505 --> 02:23:36.574
IF YOU COULD -- PERHAPS TWO TO

02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:37.976
THREE MINUTES SIR.

02:23:38.042 --> 02:23:43.748
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

02:23:43.815 --> 02:23:44.816
I AM DAVE SHELF Là VICE

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:45.817
PRESIDENT SHALL RIGHT

02:23:45.883 --> 02:23:47.685
CORPORATION DOWN IN SAN DIEGO WE

02:23:47.752 --> 02:23:49.620
MAKE -- STATE OF THE ART MASSIVE

02:23:49.687 --> 02:23:51.789
CATION SPEAKERS AND LOCATION

02:23:51.856 --> 02:23:55.360
BASED -- ALERTING SOFTWARE -- I

02:23:55.426 --> 02:23:57.362
WE WERE I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE

02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:59.364
HERE TODAY AND TO HEAR MULTIPLE

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.165
WITNESSES TALK ABOUT.

02:24:01.232 --> 02:24:03.001
THE NEED FOR REDUNDANCY THE READ

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:04.569
THEY NEED FOR A MULTI LAYERED

02:24:04.635 --> 02:24:07.672
APPROACH THAT THERE'S NOT ONE

02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:08.306
SOLUTION TO ANY OF THESE

02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:10.341
PROBLEMS -- I WOULD ALSO JUST

02:24:10.408 --> 02:24:13.111
ADD ONE THING AT THE END HERE

02:24:13.177 --> 02:24:13.778
AND THAT IS.

02:24:13.845 --> 02:24:14.979
WITHOUT A COUPLE OF CITIES IN

02:24:15.046 --> 02:24:16.447
CALIFORNIA STEP FORWARD AND

02:24:16.514 --> 02:24:19.017
ADOPT OUR MULTILAYER SOLUTION

02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:20.451
MILL VALLEY LAGUNA BEACH IN

02:24:20.518 --> 02:24:21.452
PARTICULAR.

02:24:21.519 --> 02:24:22.620
BOTH OF THOSE ARE COMMUNITIES

02:24:22.687 --> 02:24:25.890
EARLY ADOPTERS OF THIS APPROACH --

02:24:25.957 --> 02:24:26.991
THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO

02:24:27.058 --> 02:24:29.260
PROTECT THEIR SEVEN CERNER

02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:30.061
CITIZENRY.

02:24:30.128 --> 02:24:30.962
I ALSO HAVE RESOURCES A LOT OF

02:24:31.029 --> 02:24:32.630
COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE SO I

02:24:32.697 --> 02:24:34.365
WOULD SAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:24:34.432 --> 02:24:35.400
THINK ABOUT THE RESOURCE

02:24:35.466 --> 02:24:37.802
REQUIREMENTS OF SOME OF THESE

02:24:37.869 --> 02:24:38.603
THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:24:38.669 --> 02:24:39.704
AND WHETHER THAT'S DIRECT

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:41.005
FUNDING FROM LEGISLATURE OR

02:24:41.072 --> 02:24:42.940
WHETHER IT'S ESTABLISHMENT OF

02:24:43.007 --> 02:24:44.575
FUNDED GRANT PROGRAMS IT'S IT'S

02:24:44.642 --> 02:24:46.477
VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT THESE

02:24:46.544 --> 02:24:48.646
IDEAS IN THIS APPROACH BE --

02:24:48.713 --> 02:24:50.314
EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL

02:24:50.381 --> 02:24:51.282
COMMUNITIES.

02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:53.051
THANK YOU VERY MUCH COULDN'T

02:24:53.117 --> 02:24:54.585
AGREE WITH YOU MORE.

02:24:54.652 --> 02:24:56.020
TURNING ONE ELSE WHO'D LIKE TO

02:24:56.087 --> 02:24:58.790
STEP FORWARD.

02:24:58.856 --> 02:25:00.625
PART SEEING NONE.

02:25:00.691 --> 02:25:01.926
LOOKS LIKE WE ARE READY TO

02:25:01.993 --> 02:25:02.960
ADJOURN I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:04.729
GAVEL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH

02:25:04.796 --> 02:25:21.012
FOR BEING HERE

02:25:35.359 --> 02:25:35.526
