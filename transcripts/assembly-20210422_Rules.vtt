00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.446
BEEN- INTRODUCED AND PASSED IN

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:04.915
IN PREVIOUS SESSIONS AND IT'S

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:06.717
IMPORTANT TO MARK OF THE

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:09.787
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE- I THINK

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:12.223
THAT- IT IS UNFORTUNATE. THAT

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.858

TODAY I THINK IT SHOWS A

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:21.165
FAILURE OF- PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:23.267
IN THEIR CULTURE WHEN THEY

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:24.535
CANNOT LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:25.803
THE BAY CANNOT RECOGNIZE THE

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.872

ANCESTRAL PLACE LIKE TURKEY

00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:35.846
AND- AND I THINK THAT IF THERE

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:37.014
WAS A STRONGER GOVERNMENT IN

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:38.683
TURKEY- THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:40.117
TO WITHSTAND. HOLDING THAT

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:41.819
