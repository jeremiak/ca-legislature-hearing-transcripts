THANKYOU MISTER CHAIR IS MY WITNESSES COME FORWARD ME. START SO LAST YEAR WITH THE HELP OF YOUR COMMITTEE WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REDEFINING INDIGENT. INMATES SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE TO THE INCIDENTAL SAID THEY HAD AND THROUGH THAT DISCUSSION WE DISCOVERED. THAT. MANY COUNTY JAILS AND THEN THE STATE WERE REQUIRING COPAYS AND CO PAYS AS IT TURNS OUT FOR MEDICAL. DENTAL AND OTHER TREATMENTS ARE REAL IMPEDIMENT TO GETTING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT THE INMATES NEED. NOW I KNOW. MOST OF US ARE USED TO DEALING WITH COPAYS AND IN OUR WORLD CO PAYS PROVIDE. INCENTIVES TO SHOW UP AND AND AND HOW THEY HAVE A POTENTIAL DESIRED EFFECT SO THAT WE ARE A PART OF OUR MEDICAL TREATMENT IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY IN JAILS AND PRISONS AND IN FACT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT THAT THE CO. ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO TO GETTING SERVICES THERE WAS A MERCED OUTBREAK. IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS THAT WAS TIED BACK TO THE FACT THAT COPAYS WERE REQUIRED WERE A AND INMATES THAT AND HAD TO MAKE DECISION GETTING TREATMENT WHETHER THEY COULD AFFORD TO GET THE TREATMENT. THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL SHOWED THAT ARE TIED THAT THOSE MERCS OUTBREAKS IN CALIFORNIA GEORGIA AND TEXAS PRESENTS TO THE THE FACT OF COPAYS. AND THEN AGAIN THE THE OTHER RESEARCH HAS IS REALLY POINTED TO THE FACT THAT COMPANIES DON'T WORK THE SAME WAY THAT THEY HAVE. THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY DID NOT ADD THIS TO LAST YEAR'S BILL BECAUSE WE WANTED TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND I HAVE TO SAY IT'S BEEN. A REAL PLEASURE WORKING WITH THEM OVER THE LAST OVER THE FALL AND THE EARLY PART OF THIS YEAR. IN FACT THE CDC ARE HAS JUST ISSUED. GUIDANCE INTERNALLY SO THAT THEY ARE GOING TO STOP. IT -- REQUIRED COPAYS OF THEIR PRISONERS AS OF MARCH. ONE THIS BILL HOWEVER STILL IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION TO THEN REINSTATE THOSE COPAYS AND WE'RE GOING TO GO FURTHER AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO TALK TO AS MANY COUNTY JAILS AS WE CAN. WE DON'T HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT COUNTY JAILS BUT A NUMBER OF THE ONES THAT WE HAVE TALKED. TO EITHER DON'T CHARGE COPAYS BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR EXCEED WHAT THEY RECEIVE IN THE COPAYS. OR ARE MAKING DECISION NOW TO TO STOP CAUSING TO SIDE ASKING FOR THOSE COPAYS BECAUSE OF THE IMPEDIMENTS THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY PROVIDE. THAT'S THE BILL THIS BEFORE USED TO REMOVE STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION FOR COPAYS BOTH FOR STATE PRISONS AND FOR LOCAL JAILS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I DO HAVE WITNESSES. TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THEY WORK FOR BOTH YOU WITNESSES YET YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TOTAL. YOU CAN SPLIT IT UP ANY WAY YOU WAT TO MINISTER PEACE. BUT THE FIRST PERSON IF YOU GO FOUR MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS THAT MEANS. THE NEXT ONE SO ONLY HAS THIRTY SECONDS SO PLEASE BE COURTEOUS TO THE SECOND SPEAKER. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS TYLER LIGHTS ON I AM A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER WHAT CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN'S PRISONERS AND A NATIONALLY SELECT THE PEER TO PEER FELLOW. I AM ALSO FORMER FOSTER YOUTH INFORMALLY INCARCERATED WE BELIEVE HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT CHARGING FEES FOR ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT SO AND ALREADY STRUGGLING POPULATION. IS ON JUST ENOUGH SAFE SO MANY TIMES I WAS FACED WITH THE DECISION TO SEE A DOCTOR ARGUES MY LIMITED FUNDS -- HYGIENE WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE HUGE HEALTH WITH WE ARE SUBJECT AND PEOPLE TO BUY TEN I LOVE BY DETAINING LOVE ONES FROM NEED A MEDICAL SERVICES WHILE. ARE WHAT THEY ARE CROWD WHY THEY ARE CROWDED TOGETHER. IN SUCH A CONFINED SPACE SERIOUSLY OUR HAS AGREED TO ELIMINATE COPAYS BUT DOES THAT AND THIS DOES NOT BENEFIT PEOPLE INSIDE COUNTY JAILS AND PUT IN HIS BILL INTO LAW WOULD PREVENT CDC ARE FROM CHECK TO THAT POLICY BACK. TO CHARGE A CO PAYS ON A LATER DATE MANY A CUSTOMER TO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA NEVER RECEIVE PROPER MEDICAL IT'S IT'S ALONG THE STREETS. DUE TO LACK OF COVERAGE AND KERR ALLOWING MEDICAL FEES ASIDE JAILS AND PRISONS FURTHER RESTRICTS THEM FROM NEEDED MEDICAL AND DENTAL SERVICES I'VE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THE WITNESS HOW MUCH SICKER PEOPLE GET IN JAIL. WHEN THEY AVOID ASKING FOR MEDICAL HELP BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY OR DON'T WANT TO BE A MORE DAY THE SERVICE ASSOCIATION AS OPPOSED IN THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH WHAT THEY CALL FRIVOLOUS MEDICAL VISITS? BUT WE SENATE CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A CUSTOMER TO PEOPLE ARE DENIED MEDICAL HELP BECAUSE OF THIS BIG MAN PEOPLE DIE. PLEASE DO NOT ALLOW THIS FALSE IDEA ABOUT INCARCERATED ELIMINATED CO PAY ON CHARGES FOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AS GO FOR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR ALL OF US. I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE A. B.. FORTY FIVE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD TWO MINUTES. A PRACTICE -- THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE TWENTY MY NAME IS SAVANNAH O'NEILL AND I'M THE CAPACITY BUILDING A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT MANAGER AT HARM REDUCTION COALITION. I'M HERE TODAY TO SHOW MY ORGANIZATION STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI. FORTY FIVE HERMAN ACTION COALITION IS A NATIONAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT PROMOTES THE HEALTH AND DIGNITY OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY DRUG USE AND RACIALIZED DRUG POLICY. WITH EXTENSIVE WORK IN CALIFORNIA WE SEE THE OVER A PRESENTATION OF PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR INSIDE CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. PART OF MY ROLE HERMAN ACTION COALITION I WORKED AT CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP AT SCENERY TO JAIL AND ALAMEDA COUNTY. I WORKED AS THE OPIATE TREATMENT PROGRAM COORDINATOR WHERE I PROVIDED COUNSELING AND SUPPORT TO PATIENTS INSIDE THE CLINIC. BUT UNLIKE OTHER PROVIDERS PATIENTS DID NOT HAVE COPAYS TO SEE ME. I ANTICIPATE THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WILL SUGGEST THAT WITHOUT COPAYS TO DISCOURAGE FRIVOLOUS MEDICAL VISITS PATIENTS WILL OVERWHELM THE SYSTEM FOR UNNECESSARY REASONS. IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A PROVIDER THIS WAS NOT TRUE PEOPLE CAME TO SEE ME APPROPRIATELY AND WHEN NEEDED AND YET WERE OFTEN NOT SEEKING OTHER MEDICAL CARE DUE TO COST. DURING THE YEAR I WORKED IN GENERATED JAIL AND THAT WITH MANY PATIENTS WHO TOLD ME ABOUT THEIR MISSING EYE GLASSES CHEST PAINS SHOWED ME WOUNDS AND PROTRUDING BONES. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE STATED THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO REQUEST A HE COULDN'T WRITE LETTERS TO HIS DAUGHTER AND ANOTHER WOMAN SAID SHE NEEDED TO SAVE EXTRA MONEY FOR FOOD DURING HER PREGNANCY. THIS COST LEADS PEOPLE TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT CHOICE BETWEEN MEDICAL CARE OR BASIC NECESSITIES. EVEN IN THE SHORT TIME I WITNESS HEALTH CONDITIONS WORSENED BY PEOPLE'S INABILITY TO ACCESS CARE SOMETIMES LEADING THE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SURGERY. LAST WEEK CDC ARE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL ABOLISH COPAYS AFTER COMING TO A SIMILAR CONCLUSION THEIR PRESS RELEASE STATED IT WAS DETERMINED THAT COPAYS HAVE MINIMAL FISCAL BENEFITS AND ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH PATIENT CARE. YET THE SEVENTY THOUSAND HUMAN BEINGS INSIDE CALIFORNIA JAILS WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM THIS CHANGE. COPAYS AND JAILS LIKE SANTA RITA WILL MAIN THREE DOLLARS A VISIT AND WHILE THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A SMALL AMOUNT IT CAN BE A LOT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S INCARCERATED WHILE IN JAIL PEOPLE HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY INCOME OR WORK UNLIKE THE MINIMAL WORK AVAILABLE INSIDE PRISONS. AND PEOPLE IN JAIL FACE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL PRESSURES IN LEGAL AND BILL FEES. OVER MY TWELVE YEAR CAREER AS A SOCIAL WORKER AND ADDICTION TREATMENT COUNSELOR I'VE SEEN HOW BARRIERS TO CARE OUTSIDE AND INSIDE JAIL WALLS LEAD TO WORSE MORE COMPLEX AND MORE EXPENSIVE HEALTH ISSUES. BY ELIMINATING THIS COPAY AB FORTY FIVE WILL HELP IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND BRING CALIFORNIA ONE STEP CLOSER TO CREATING MORE JUST HEALTH CARE FOR PEOPLE BEHIND BARS. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES EXCELLENT -- EITHER. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION BECAUSE I SEE A CHEN FLOOR IN BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD NAME AN ORGANIZATION NECKS. GOOD MORNING MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. LIZZY BEACON WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA CO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT. Q..

SHARON STONE WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. JIM LIMBURG FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] OUR EDDIE HAD CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. COR CELLS A LOW HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY BUT TO BE CLEAR SURE SIR ACUTELY AWARE OF THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF INMATES IN THEIR CARE AND CUSTODY. STRIVE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH APPROPRIATE TREATMENT THAT SAID ELIMINATING THE ABILITY TO CHARGE THIS MODEST FEE -- WHICH IS STATUTORILY IN WITH LIMITED TO THREE DOLLARS WILL REMOVE A USEFUL TOOL THAT DISCOURAGES -- FRIVOLOUS REQUESTS FOR MEDICAL VISITS WILL LET ME BE CLEAR THAT STATUTE ALREADY PROVIDES. BETTER IF NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN A PERSON'S ACCOUNTS THERE IS NO CHARGE FOR AN INMATE INITIATED MEDICAL THIS. BUT NO IN MADE SHALL BE DENIED MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FUNDS IN THEIR PERSONAL ACCOUNT. THE STATUTE FURTHER PROVIDES AT THE MEDICAL PROVIDER IS PERMITTED TO WAIVE THE FEE IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. AND THAT THE MEDICAL PROVIDER SHALL WAIVE THE FEE IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE FOR RELATING TO AN EMERGENCY SITUATION OR ANOTHER MEDICAL SITUATION INVOLVING GREAT PAINTER IMMEDIACY. AND FINALLY THE STATUTE ALREADY PROVIDE AT THE DIRECTION OF MEDICAL STAFF SHALL BE WITHOUT CHARGE. SO AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRYING TO COLLECT THREE DOLLARS FROM AN INMATE JUST TO RAISE MONEY THE THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT. THERE ARE INMATES. FOR BETTER OR WORSE WHO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION WHO SEEK TO GET OUT OF THERE SO -- BECAUSE NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD A MEDICAL ISSUE NECESSARILY BUT BECAUSE THEY THEY WANT TO LEAVE THEIR CELL. AND SO BECAUSE WE THINK THIS IS A USEFUL TOOL IN PREVENTING OR AT LEAST TRYING TO DISCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE IMPACT OF STOPPING SOMEONE FROM GETTING MEDICAL CARE IF THEY TRULY NEEDED. EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FUNDS IN THERE AND MADE ACCOUNT -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THE BILL THANK YOU. ONE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RANCHERO WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION LIKE TO ECHO OF COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUE -- SIR CELL SOLO AND ALSO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT COUNTY JAIL THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE COMPLETELY. UNDERSTAFFED AN OVERCROWDED AND HAVING -- A MANDATE TO NOW WALK EVERY SINGLE INMATE WHO REQUESTS MEDICAL -- IN FROM MEDICAL IS GOING TO DEFINITELY IMPACT THE OPERATIONS OF THE COUNTY JAILS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IN. COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM YES MISTER. SO MR CELLS ELLA -- MY CONCERN IS SOMEONE COULD HAVE THREE DOLLARS IN AN ACCOUNT. BUT IT'S THEIR ONLY THREE DOLLARS AND THEY MIGHT NEEDED TO MAKE A PHONE CALL HOME THAT MIGHT NEEDED -- FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND SO EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE THE THREE DOLLARS GIVEN THAT THEY CAN'T EARN MONEY WHILE THEY'RE IN JAIL. AND MANY OF THEM ARE ISOLATED -- FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE THE MONEY -- AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S ALLOW THEIR THAT THAT'S MY MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS NOT THAT. I AM SURE THAT THE SHERIFF IS I KNOW HIM IN ALAMEDA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DIDN'T HAVE THREE DOLLARS HE LET HIM GO -- BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THEY HAVE SO LITTLE MONEY THAT THREE DOLLARS IS VERY PRECIOUS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SO. THAT'S MY CONCERN YOU HAVE A RESPONSE OH SURE I DON'T. KNOW IF THE QUESTION. IS WHETHER THE CHAIR OF THE I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND MISTER QUIRK AND I I THINK IN THE SITUATION WHICH YOU DESCRIBED IN WHICH AN INMATE DOESN'T HAVE. SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT THE STATUTE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SHERIFF DECISION THE STATUTE PROVIDES. THAT THE PERSON SHALL NOT BE CHARGED IF THEY DON'T HAVE REALLY RECOGNIZES. THAT CONCERN IN THAT WAY AND WE THINK DISTRICTS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN SAYING LOOK IF A PERSON IS MEDICAL CARE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS. THEN THAT'S THE SITUATION BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT IF THERE ARE FAMILY UNDERSTAND YOUR EXAMPLE TALK ABOUT SOMEONE WHO MAY BE ISOLATED. BUT IF THEY HAVE SOME FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT AND THAT'S DETERMINATION THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE AGAIN. THE PROVIDER IS PERMITTED TO WAIVE THE FEE AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT'S AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY THEY'RE REQUIRED TO WAIVE THE FEE. BUT THE POINT HERE IS -- YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE. A BAD COLD BIKE I HAVE HAD FOR THE LAST MONTH THAT COULD BE GOING INTO BRONCHITIS. IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY BUT YOU ONLY HAVE THREE DOLLARS IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE THAT CALL OUR AND YOU NEED THAT THREE DOLLARS TO MAKE THAT CALL -- SOMEONE. WOULD BE TEMPTED PERHAPS NOT TO GO AND THEN THEY HAVE PNEUMONIA -- BEFORE SO MY QUESTION AGAIN IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE THREE DOLLARS IT'S CLEAR BUT IF THEY ONLY HAVE THREE DOLLARS MY CONCERN IS. THAT THEY WOULD BE TEMPTED NOT TO GO WORSE IN MY YOU KNOW. DO YOU HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM. BY. THE THE CASE IN WHICH YOU DESCRIBE COULD BE FAIRLY SPECIFIC AND AS MUCH AS AN INMATE MAY ONLY HAVE EXACTLY THE PRICE OF THE MEDICAL COPAY. THIS ASSUMING THAT THE SHERIFF IS ACTUALLY CHARGING AT AND IF THEY'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE FEES CHARGED. AND THE PERSON ONLY HAS EXACTLY THREE DOLLARS AND THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE AND THAT'S A CHOICE THAT HAS TO BE MADE AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL CHOOSE THE MEDICAL CARE BUT WE UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERN BUT THAT'S AGAIN WE WE WE SEE THE THE THE THE BIGGER CONCERN FOR US IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE WHO IS NOT IN NEED OF MEDICAL CARE -- THAT AGAIN THIS CAN BE A DETERRENT TO SEEKING WHAT WE WOULD DESCRIBE AS A FRIVOLOUS REQUEST. MOVE THE BILL [inaudible] YES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE DID I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY THAT CDC OURS ALREADY REMOVED THIS PRACTICE YES THEY HAVE AND IN FACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE WE DON'T HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION WE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH OUT TO ALL THE COUNTIES. AND HEARD BACK FROM ONLY SOME BUT COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE AS LARGE AS SANTA CLARA. DON'T CHARGE THESE HE'S ALREADY BECAUSE THE COST OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS MORE THAN WHAT THEY RECEIVE. THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE NOT FOUND A CHALLENGE WITH FRIVOLOUS. SUITS AND THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE NATIONALLY -- BOTH STATE JAILS AND LOCAL JAILS AND STATE PRISONS. HAS SHOWN THAT THESE KINDS OF FEES THE COPAYS ARE MORE OF AN IMPEDIMENT TO GETTING. ACCESS SO THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS. MINIMAL AMOUNTS IN THEIR CAMP MAY NOT SEEK SERVICE BECAUSE THEY THEY WANT TO HOLD ON TO THAT MONEY AND YES THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE MAY HAVE THE RIGHT OR THE ABILITY TO WAY THAT. BUT IF THEY DON'T THEN THAT IN SAID THAT IN MAY TENDS NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES. THEREBY FORCING A AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHERE THERE HAD BEEN ONE IN THE PAST. THIS IS A POPULATION THAT HAS VERY LOW HEALTH EDUCATION THEY DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEMS WORK SO THEY'RE NOT INCLINED TO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS BEING SUPPORTED. BY A NUMBER THE MEDICAL HEALTH PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY SEE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS IN JAILS AND PRISONS. THAT DID AREA THAT THIS REPRESENTS. YES MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE MISTER STONE THANK YOU SO I HAVE ALSO READ THAT IF A PERSON IS UNABLE TO PAY THE THREE DOLLARS AT A HOLD IS PUT ON THEIR ACCOUNT FOR THIRTY DAYS. AND SO WITH THIS BILL REMOVE THAT WHOLE CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT IT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE STATUTORY. AUTHORITY TO CHARGE THE COPAY SO THERE COULD BE NO ACTION TAKEN AGAINST IT AND MADE WITH RESPECT TO HOW MUCH THEY HAVE OR DON'T HAVE IN THEIR ACCOUNT. BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO AUTHORIZATION TO CHARGE THAT COPAYS WOULD NOT BE OWED FROM THAT THAT INMATE AT ALL. YOU WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- ACT. HI SECOND DOCTOR QUICK MOTION MOVED ABOUT. ALL RIGHT BE MORE QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU [inaudible] VIEW -- SO -- IS IS IRONIC WE'RE HAVING. THE DISCUSSION ABOUT PAYING FOR MEDICAL CARE INSIDE OF JAILS WERE HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION WITH A FOUR WHEEL CARE ACT IN. HEALTH CARE FOR ALL WERE WERE TRYING TO GET TO A POINT. WE DON'T PAY. OR FIVE THE SYSTEM WHERE. IS AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE. AND I KNOW THREE DOLLARS. FOR THOSE OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW MAIN NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S A LOT OF MONEY WHEN YOU'RE. WHEN YOU'RE IN JAIL? ONE AND TWO I I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE TE CAPACITY TO HAVE THE THREE DOLLARS MAY STILL. DO TO FRIVOLOUS TYPE OF THINGS THAT THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENTS TALKING ABOUT I'M AND WE SHOULD BE -- ON DEFINITELY -- COGNIZANT OF THAT THAT COULD PRESENT SOME PROBLEMS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY AFTER WATCHING SOMEONE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER QUIRK WHO THOUGHT HE JUST HAD A MINOR COLD. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MISS THE TO BRONCHITIS. I CAN SEE HOW. SOMEONE NOT MEDICALLY TRAINED MAY DENY SOMEONE. AS THEY NOW HAVE THE POWER BECAUSE OF THREE DOLLARS WAS THE LIMIT. OR FIVE DOLLARS WHATEVER IS TO DETER SOMEONE THEY NOW CAN JUST SAY NO BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK YOUR BILL ENOUGH FOR WHATEVER. ASIDE EIGHT CHAIRS RECOMMENDED I VOTE AND MAY CALL THE ROLL. ON AB FORTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAND. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP [inaudible] THANK. DEEP ABSTAINED KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE AYE QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. WICKS I WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU AND THANK -- JESSE GABRIEL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL AB ONE SIX FIVE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN YEAH. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY. TO PRESENT AB ONE SIXTY FIVE THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL SAVE LIVES BY ENSURING THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED. ON THE USE OF GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I. G. V. R. O. IS A JUDICIAL ORDER THAT ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TEMPORARILY CONFISCATE FIREARMS FROM AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO POSES AN IMMINENT RISK OF HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS? WHEN PROPERLY USED G. V. R. OWES ARE A POWERFUL TOOL THAT CAN PREVENT MASS STUDENT NOW SHOOTINGS SUICIDES AND SAVE LIVES? UNFORTUNATELY GEV ARE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY UNDER UTILIZED SINCE THEY WERE FIRST INTRODUCED IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NOTABLY LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED ORDERS WERE ISSUED DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS THEY WERE AVAILABLE. THOSE NUMBERS INCREASED SOMEWHAT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THANKS LARGELY TO INNOVATIVE TRAINING PIONEERED BY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN SEVERAL COUNTIES. WHICH HAVE HELPED LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS BETTER UNDERSTAND WHEN AND HOW TO SEEK THESE ORDERS. FOR EXAMPLE A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE G. V. R. O. S. WERE ISSUED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY LAST YEAR 43% OF THE STATEWIDE TOTAL. THANKS TO THE GOOD WORK OF SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY MARK ELLIOTT WHO HAS BEEN A KEY ADVOCATE AND LEADER FOR INCREASED TWO G. B. R. O. TRAINING. THESE STATISTICS SHOW US THE TRAINING WORKS AND THAT WE NEED STATEWIDE TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THIS POWERFUL TOOL IS BEING USED TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES AND KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. WITH ME TODAY ARE TO TESTIFY ARE TWO LEADING ADVOCATES JULIA WEBER FROM THE DIFFERENCE LAWCENTER AND AMANDA WILCOX FROM THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JULIE A WEBER AND I'M APPEARING ON BEHALF OF GIFFORD'S LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. IN SUPPORT AND AS A SPONSOR OF AB. ONE SIXTY FIVE I WORKED IN THE FIELD OF DOMESTIC SPONSOR FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS INCLUDING SEVENTEEN YEARS WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DEVELOPING RULES AND FORMS IN THE AREA OF PROTECTIVE IN RESTRAINING ORDERS. AND PROVIDING EDUCATION FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND TEACHING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE A GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. I'M NOW A FELLOW WITH THE GIFFORDS LAWCENTER FOCUSED ON GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER IMPLEMENTATION STATEWIDE. UNFORTUNATELY WE BELIEVE THIS IMPORTANT TOOL HAS NOT BEEN FULLY UTILIZED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. IN PART BECAUSE OF LIMITED TRAINING AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS R. G. B. R. ROSE. THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER RESTRAINING ORDERS IN SEVERAL WAYS OF FIRST WALL THE GT R. O. IS A CIVIL MATTER CRIMINAL PROCEEDING LAW ENFORCEMENT PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. IN G. R. OWES ITS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER RESTRAINING ORDERS AND OTHER PROCESS SEES. THERE'S ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR CONFUSION BETWEEN THE NOW TWO DIFFERENT EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDERS WE NOW HAVE TWO DIFFERENT E. P. O.'S. ONE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE AND STOCKING AND ONE FOR GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. ARE AND ALSO AFTER THE EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDER WERE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A PARTY IN THE CASE WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER RESTRAINING ORDERS. ADDITIONALLY THE G. V. R. O. IS CIVIL BUT APPEARS IN THE PENAL CODE. WHICH HAS CAUSED SOME CONFUSION FOR FOR ITS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHERS. THE BASIS FOR AND REMEDIES UNDER THE GB RO ARE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER RESTRAINING ORDERS. OTHER RESTRAINING ORDERS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT AN INDIVIDUAL FROM DANGER BY RESTRAINING ANOTHER PERSON'S BEHAVIOR THE G. V. R. O. RESTRAINED SOMEONE'S BEHAVIOR BUT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. WE KNOW INFORMATION DISSEMINATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ANOTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN LIMITED. AND IN OTHER STATES GRASSROOTS EFFORTS DESIGNED TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR THE POLICY CHANGE MEANT MORE STAKEHOLDERS KNEW ABOUT THE LAW BEFORE IT WAS ENACTED. SO FINALLY I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SOME RECENT TRAGEDIES INVOLVING CALLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY HAVE BEEN PREVENTED HAD A G. V. R. O. BEEN EXECUTED. AND FIREARMS CONFISCATED UNDER THE G. V. R. O.. TRAINING IS CRITICAL TO FULLY REALIZE ALL OF THE G. V. R. O. IN OUR STATE WE URGE YOU TO VOTE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS AMANDA WILCOX I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. A FOR THE NEW MEMBERS HERE -- I'LL JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN OF ADVOCATE AS A VOLUNTEER. SINCE TWO FIVE TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN THIS BUILDING. AND I DO THIS WORK IN MEMORY OF MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE RAMPAGE SHOOTING IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND ONE IN NEVADA COUNTY. THE BRADY CAMPAIGN WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE PASSAGE OF THE ORIGINAL LAW AND TWENTY FOURTEEN AYE AND WE WORKED VERY HARD ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT LAW WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT TWENTY SIXTEEN IN FACT WE WORK BEFORE. TWENTY SIXTEEN I WITH YOU JUST JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS THEY WERE SETTING UP THE PROCESS SOME FORMS -- USE OF THE LAW AS YOU'VE HEARD HAS BEEN -- DISAPPOINTING AND SLOW I BELIEVE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS LAW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE MANY LIVES IN THE FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN SO UNDER USED IN CALIFORNIA. IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN FOURTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE NOW ENACTED SIMILAR LAWS IN APPEARS THAT MOST STATES ARE USING IT. AT A FAR GREATER RATE THAN CALIFORNIA WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME. THAT SOME AGENCIES DO NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE LAW. OTHERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT FILLS GAPS IN EXISTING LAW. IN OUR MANY AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE A PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LAW IN THEIR OWN JURISDICTION. AM IN AS IF YOU'RE HURT IT'S IN THE ANALYSIS IN THE MEMBER STATED THAT A MANY COUNTIES. HAVE NEVER HEARD AND ISSUED AN ORDER THERE'S TWENTY MY OWN COUNTY NEVADA COUNTY IS ISSUED. ONE AND THEY DID IT AFTER I HAPPEN TO TELL OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO'S A FRIEND WHO WERE IN A MEETING TOGETHER ABOUT THE LAW. THAT'S A HECK OF A WAY TO INFORM HARM LAW ENFORCEMENT OF A NEW LAW YOU KNOW THE CHANCES THAT A ADVOCATES FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE COUNTY -- SO WE REALLY NEED TO OUR STATE WIDE PROCESS FOR EDUCATING -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BUT PARTICULARLY LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE USING THE MOST THEY'VE USED IN 90% OF THE TIME THUS FAR -- ON HOW TO USE THIS LOSS THAT WE CAN REALIZE LIFESAVING BENEFITS. MY DAUGHTER'S KILLER. HAD THAT MENTAL ILLNESS BUT HE HAD NEVER BEEN. FIFTY ONE FIFTY I DID NOT HAVE A SEVENTY TWO HOUR OR EXCUSE ME DID NOT HAVE A FIVE YEAR MENTAL HEALTH HOLD HE NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME WE HEAR THAT STORY. SO OFTEN HIS FAMILY MEMBERS HIS GIRLFRIEND IS HANK'S WORKER ALL CONCERNED ABOUT ON THERE IS NO LEGAL TOOL AT THAT TIME FOR REMOVING THE GUN. I DO NOT WANT THAT SITUATION HAPPEN AGAIN TO OTHER FAMILIES PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE A TOOL WE JUST NEED TO USE THAT. SIRE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. MISTER MEMBERS AT OKAY BUT ON BEHALF OF EVERY TOWN FOR GUN SAFETY AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

AND THEY ONLY SCHOOL POLICE BUT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IN SYSTEMATIZING THE TRAINING. TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE A ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE A COMMENT COMMENT MR LACKEY. L. A RESUME OF GABRIEL YOU'RE TO BE COMMENDED FOR RECOGNIZING SOMETHING THAT'S A REALLY REALLY. A NICE TOOL THAT NEEDS TO BE. SPREAD AMONGST THE A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSION. HOWEVER HERE'S MY CONCERN MY CONCERN IS. I'M CLEARLY GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT I FEAR THAT THE COST MAY BECOME PROBLEMATIC AND HERE'S THE BIGGEST COST OF I THINK YOU NEED TO REALLY. THINK THROUGH OF MAYBE A MORE PRACTICAL WAY THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE FIELD WE HAVE A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEACE OFFICERS IN NINETEEN HUNDREDS OF DECENT LIKE THAT. IN CALIFORNIA AND TO TRAIN ALL OF THEM WITHIN TWO YEARS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE AND VERY AGGRESSIVE. GOAL I I'D SAY THE ENTRANCE LEVEL BUT THAT COULD BE HANDLED. WITH REASON WILL COST. BUT KNOWING THE SYSTEM AND KNOWING THE DEMANDS ON BUDGETS I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT IS. GOING TO BE A REAL IMPEDIMENT. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER VERY VERY -- SERIOUSLY SO -- NO THIS IS A GREAT TOOL AND I CAN TELL YOU AFTER TWENTY YEARS WILL ON FORCE A PROFESSION THAT TRAINING. GOOD TRAINING. IS INVALUABLE AND IT IS THE WAY TO SHAPE BEHAVIOR OF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THANK YOU FOR FOR THIS -- VERY IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY. SO -- MISTER VICE CHAIR YOU BRING UP A BIG CONCERN AND WE HAVE BILLS EVERY YEAR ASKING FOR THIS OR THAT INTO POST. ALL I WOULD SAY -- IN THIS CASE THIS IS ONE THAT I CAN SUPPORT I NOTE THAT THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION. ARE IN FAVOR IN THERE ARE WELL AWARE OF YOU ARE IN PARTICULAR SO WITH THAT I'LL MOVE TO BAIL. MS BAUER CON [inaudible] OR YES YOU HAVE A QUESTION. SO -- LOG THOUGH THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR COMMENTS I TO WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I HAD A QUESTION. MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE I STEPPED OUT DO WE KNOW WHAT THE COSTS ARE THAT ARE SO -- SO SEATED WITH THE BILL. I DON'T KNOW I I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND PERHAPS TO DO BUT ON THE TRAIN ON THE TRAINING WILL I WOULD JUST WANT. TO THROW IN A COMMENT HERE THAT WE ALREADY REQUIRE TRAINING ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDERS AND PROCEDURES FOR OF SERVING ORDERS AND ALSO ON DE ESCALATION IN MENTAL HEALTH SITUATIONS AND SO THE THE FACT THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY INTEGRATE THE G. V. R. O.. INFORMATION IS IS A PROBLEM FOR ALL THAT EXISTING TRADING SO I WOULD JUST. SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO INCLUDE G. B. R. O. INFORMATION IN ANY TRAINING ON OTHER RELATED ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH SUICIDE PREVENTION AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET OF COURSE THAT'S NOT A SIGN BUDGET YET THAT HE HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. ARE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO POST TO CREATE NEW UNITS -- HOPEFULLY ONE OF THESE NEW UNITS THE G. VERO TRAINING AND I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH POST REGARDING THE TRAINING VIDEO WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OF ACTUALLY ASKED -- FOR AND THE COST OF TRAINING VIDEO WHICH IS VERY TYPICAL FOR SHOWING. OFFICERS -- WHO ARE ALREADY SERVING IS ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS FOR CALIFORNIA THAT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY THANK YOU. I CAN I IT YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR CALLS CRASH ONE THAT RESPOND TO HIS COULD. DO QUESTION [inaudible] GO AHEAD. A SECOND MISTER CLARK'S MOTION OF THE BILL. OKAY. THE OTHER QUESTIONS JUST REAL QUICKLY. SECOND SHOT OF THE WELL THE BY SHEER GET SPECIAL COMPENSATION HERE'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT TWO YEAR REQUIREMENT RIGHT BE GIVEN MORE TIME WHAT WOULD BE. MORE MANAGEABLE AND AND LESS MONEY. BECAUSE YOU'RE OVER TIME CONSIDERATIONS ALL THESE OTHER -- VERY VERY COSTLY CONSIDERATION SO THAT'S WOULD YOU CONSIDER EVEN. EXTENDING THAT TO YOUR WENT ON TO THE FIRST QUESTION AN EXACT WONDERFUL THANK THANK OF OF DEEP EXPERIENCE HERE AND I'M. VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE SPELL -- ABSOLUTELY WE JUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM PORAC I JUST BECAME AWARE OF IT -- YESTERDAY WHEN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR TO TO US WE ARE VERY EAGER TO BE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THIS IN A WAY WHERE EVERYBODY CAN BE IN SUPPORT. AND IN -- IN A WAY THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THIS BILL WHICH I I FIRMLY BELIEVE WILL HELP SAVE LIVES BUT ALSO ARE SENSITIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT ARE GOING TO DO THIS WORK IN THE FIELD SO ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS AND YOU MAKE CLOTHES MISTER GABER I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU YES AND SO I I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY AND IT'S GOOD TO ASK HOW MUCH THINGS COST BUT THIS IS THE POLICY. COMMITTEE -- AND SINCE I SERVE ON BUDGET SO. FIVE EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE I BOTH CHAIRED AND BEEN ON BUDGETS OF FIVE ALL. ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE ASSEMBLY -- WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE COSTS SHOULD ALSO MENTION. EVERY YEAR THIS BODY MONEY INTO POST THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR. JUST SAY WAS TAKEN OUT. AND WE PUSHED AND PUSHED AND PUSHED HARPER FOR MONEY IN THE POST AND TRAINING TO HIGH PRIORITY FOR US -- I THINK A LOT OF BILLS EVEN GET THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS -- STATE THEY FEEL THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO I AM HOPING THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD AND I'M RECOMMENDED NIGHT IS MOVES FORWARD -- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT THEY'LL GET MONETIZED IN APPROPRIATIONS. THAT -- IT'LL STILL MOVE FORWARD AFTER THAT NICO MANAGER CALDERON. ON AB ONE SIXTY FIVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL THE MOTION IS TO PASSED YOU APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER CHEN SO YOU'RE AYE LACKEY. LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAND. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE I KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. WICKS HIGH SWIG SIGH. THAT PASSES GRADUATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER. THIS YOUR FIRST BILL. OKAY MISTER COOPER A. B. ONE THREE SEVEN UP. PEACE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST A BE ONE THREE SEVEN CREATES A MINIMUM STANDARD. THE TYPE OF INFORMATION AFFORD A PEACE OFFICER IN NON CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATIONS. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES A PEACE OFFICER MUST BE NOTIFIED OF THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION. PRIOR TO INTERROGATION. SOME EMPLOYERS HAVE NARROWLY INTERPRETED THE NATURE INVESTIGATION TO MEAN ONLY THE DATE TIME AND PLACE OF THE INTERROGATION. AND SOMETIMES A CHARGE OF THE INTERROGATION. THIS IS CREATE DELAYS IN THE NON CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS UNNECESSARILY STOLEN THAT'S OCCASIONS AS WILL FILL GIVE PEACE OFFICERS THE BASIC RIGHTS. OF FAIR IN REPRESENTATION. AB ONE THREE SEVEN SIX TO MAINTAIN THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP BY PROVIDING PEACE OFFICERS IN THEIR UNION REPRESENTATIVES WITH THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO RESPOND TO INVESTIGATIONS. IN A TIMELY MANNER. AB ONE THIRTY SO CATION BETWEEN UNION MEMBER AND YOU REPRESENTATIVE AND NOT CRIMINAL. MYSTERY INVESTIGATIONS. WITH ME DAY TESTIFY IS ONE VERMONT IS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ORANGE COUNTY GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ONE VERMONTERS AND I AM THE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT WHAT THE ASSOCIATIONS OF ORANGE COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFFS AND A MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. OUR ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS ABOUT THIRTY NINE HUNDRED ACTIVE AND RETIRED SWORN PEACE OFFICERS ALL TOGETHER. FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE PROBATION DEPARTMENT NO SEE PARKS. AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR TWO PRINCIPAL RATE REASONS. FIRST IT CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW. THE LAW ALREADY REQUIRES THAT OFFICER TO BE INFORMED OF THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION. THIS BILL IS NOT CREATING FURTHER PROTECTION AND SIMPLY CLARIFYING EXISTING ALONG IN A VERY LIMITED AND PRECISE WAY. WE HAVE SEEN DEPARTMENTS GIVE LITTLE MORE THAN THE CHARGE ITSELF AND NO OTHER INFORMATION SUCH AS THE DATE TIME. OR GENERAL CHARACTERIZATION. SECOND THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE PRIVILEGE TO THAT PLACE TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH THEIR LABOR REPRESENTATIVES. WE HAVE HAD DEPUTIES TALK TO THEIR LABOR REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT THINGS THEY HAVE SEEN SUCH AS WORKING CONDITION STAFFING XTERRA. AND BE COMPELLED TO DISCLOSE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH MANAGEMENT. THIS -- CREATES A CHILLING EFFECT. OFFICERS WILL NO LONGER WANT TO COME TO US THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. AND WE THINK THAT'S SIMPLY WRONG. WHAT THAT WE REQUEST YOUR YES VOTE ON AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU? THANK YOU NEXT. RESEARCHER MEMBERS JIM LEVIN ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OR COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFF'S ALSO LONG BEACH POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE -- AGAIN I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSING THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AT THIS BILL -- HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OR VIOLATIONS. THINK WE NEED TO FRAME THIS AS A EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE -- BILL REGARDING THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THE DUE PROCESS -- THAT'S ALREADY ENTITLED TO THESE OFFICE SO WE ARE SIMPLY CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW IN TWO PARTS OF THIS BILL -- THAT WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH -- MANY OF OUR JURISDICTIONS HAS BEEN CIRCUMVENTED THIS POINT-- SO THERE'S CASE LAW ALREADY ON THE BOOKS WERE SIMPLY CODIFYING IN CLARIFYING -- EXISTING LAW -- AGAIN ANY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY INVESTIGATION IS SEPARATE THAT'S A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION ANY HEIGHTENED ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE THAT OFFICER GOES OUT ON A MINISTRY TO BELIEVE WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE INFRACTIONS. THINGS LIKE WHAT WE SEE ROUTINELY. OF BRINGING -- BRINGING DISCIPLINE ON THE BRING LIABILITY ON THE DEPARTMENT -- ROOM DISCOURTEOUS TREATMENT IF SOMEBODY A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC HERE YOU SWEAR -- THINK ABOUT SIR YOU KNOW TRAFFIC STOPS OR TOWING SITUATION IN IN THE JAIL SETTING IT COULD BE THAT THE FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO YOU THAT WAS COLD AND IT SHOULD BEEN HOT. THAT'S A COMPLAINT THEY CAN BE REGISTERED AGAINST AN OFFICER EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT HAS TO BE INVESTIGATED -- SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE IS SIMPLY -- DAYTIME GENERAL CHARACTERIZATION AHEAD OF TIME AS THE LAW REQUIRES A AND THEN PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION AROUND THE COMMUNICATION THAT THAT OFFICER IN A LABOR SETTING HAS WITH THEIR LABOR REPRESENTATIVES THAT AT THIS POINT HAS -- THAT APPARENTLY THERE'S A LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW SIR IS PRIVILEGED. BUT THE COMMUNICATION FOR WHATEVER REASON FROM THE OFFICER TO THAT LABOR REPRESENTATIVE IS NOT US WE ARE CREATING A RECIPROCAL PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION -- AND WITHOUT ANSWER I BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF DEPUTY -- DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND THE LA COUNTY PROFESSIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. ALL IN SUPPORT OF A VERY GOOD SENSE BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME ORGANIZATION MYSTERY MEMBERS RAINY PERRY THERE AND READING ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PATROL AND POOR I CAN SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL CURRY ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONS SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. CHAIR RICE FROM OF THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU [inaudible] ARE THERE. ANY OTHER SUPPORT ANY ONE IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] STATE [inaudible] GOOD. COULD YOU PLEASE MAKE ROOMS LIKE THIS MORE THAN [inaudible] PUT THE THE OKAY [inaudible] SO. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- LIZZY GIVEN WHAT THEY SELL YOU CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO AB -- ONE THIRTY SEVEN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL IMPEDE EFFECTIVE MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HOLD OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY COMMIT MISCONDUCT. I'M CURRENT LAW. AS AS I SAID DOES IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE HAVING DISCLOSING ANY OF THIS INFORMATION DURING AN INVESTIGATION. IN FACT IT IS OFTEN PROVIDED I'M DURING INVESTIGATION -- WHEN THE AND WHEN THEY WOULD? HELP WITH A PRODUCTIVE AND FAIR INVESTIGATION. UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS ALWAYS READILY AVAILABLE DURING EVERY INVESTIGATION I'M SOMETHING IS SOMETIMES SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THE DATE AND TIME. OF THE INCIDENT ISSUE -- MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR OR ACCURATE -- AND THIS COULD BE TO SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO MADE THE COMPLAINT GOT THE DATE WRONG AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF THAT INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE OR IF IT IS NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE THAT THAT IS NOT A MEANS FOR OVERTURNING ANY DISCIPLINE THAT COULD RESULT FROM. FROM SUSTAIN FINDING MISCONDUCT I'M SIMILARLY THE TITLE OF ANY POLICIES ORDERS RULES PROCEDURES OR DIRECTIVES ON IT THIS COULD ALSO NOT BE FULLY KNOWN AT THE ONSET OF AN INVESTIGATION. THERE COULD BE INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT MIGHT. LEAD TO THE AGENCY TO TO WANT TO INVESTIGATE ANOTHER FORM OF MISCONDUCT THAT WASN'T IN THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT OR THAT WASN'T -- THOUGH THE AGENCY WASN'T AWARE OF AT THE ONSET OF THE INVESTIGATION. SO -- SO AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. IF AN OFFICER HAS COMMITTED ACTUAL MISCONDUCT THAT THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE DISCIPLINED AND THAT -- JUST BECAUSE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION ISN'T AVAILABLE THAT THAT DOESN'T WHILE THE OFFICER TO COMPLETELY AVAILABLE EVADE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MISCONDUCT. I I ALSO JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT POLICE MISCONDUCT IS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA -- WIN A COMMUNITY MEMBER. HAS CONCERNS ABOUT AN OFFICER'S INTEGRITY. THAT CONCERN NEEDS TO BE -- MEANING FULLY INVESTIGATED AND TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS IT IS ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF COMPLAINTS OR SUSTAINED IT IS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS -- AND IN MANY AGENCIES IT'S LESS THAN 5% AND SO THIS IS NOT A SYSTEM. ALREADY IN WHICH MEMBERS OF THE FEEL LIKE THERE ARE CONCERNS ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND THAT IS WHY MOST PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE MISCONDUCT DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO FILE A COMPLAINT. AND SO WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL WILL MAKE THAT PROBLEM EVEN WORSE IT'LL RACKED MORE OF A SHIELD TO PLEASE ACCOUNTABILITY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST. THANK YOU. MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- WE OPPOSE ON AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO TAKE CORRUPT OR ABUSE OF POLICE OFFICERS OFF THE STREETS. AND ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT STATES DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH -- THESE THIS BILL WOULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO INVESTIGATIONS INTO POLICE. MISCONDUCT. UP BY PREVENTING INVESTIGATORS FROM QUESTIONING THE OFFICERS SUSPECTED ABOUT MISCONDUCT. I THINK WE NEED TO JUST STEP BACK A MINUTE AND HISTORICALLY ON THIS IS PART OF THE POLICE OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS THESE WERE ON BILLS OF RIGHTS WERE ENACTED. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND IT WAS A PUSH BACK AGAINST THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND AGAINST THE CASES OF POLICE BRUTALITY THEY WERE ENACTED IN THE NUMBER OF STATES. AND SO WHAT WE SEE NOW IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT IN THE FIVE ON THE FACE OF THE CURRENT MOVEMENT. TO FOR POLICE TRANSPARENCY TO HOLD POLICE OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE IS TO EXPAND THAT POLICE OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS. AND THIS IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THESE RIGHTS THAT THEY COULD TRY TO CHARACTERIZE SAYS EMPLOYER -- EMPLOYEE RIGHTS ARE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEE HAS IN THE STATE. THEIR MORE EXPANSIVE THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD BE QUESTIONED ABOUT MISCONDUCT. OR ON ANYTHING THAT MIGHT MORPH INTO MISCONDUCT WE DON'T GIVE SPECIAL RIGHTS. TO MILITARY SO OF SPECIAL RIGHTS TO FIREMAN WE DON'T GIVE SPECIAL RIGHTS TO THE MENTALLY ILL. SO THERE IS NO REASON THAT THESE PUBLIC SERVANTS. WHO SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SPECIAL RIGHTS? AND WE KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THAT THERE ARE -- FREQUENTLY ARISES THE NEED TO QUESTION POLICE OFFICERS IN THE STATE AND THAT SOMETIMES THAT DOES -- BECOME ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. AND WE HAVE THE EXAMPLES -- JUST THIS MORNING THERE WAS RELEASED -- BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY -- A REPORT THAT WAS RECEIVED WRAP IT UP OKAY OF IN THE LAST TEN YEARS TWELVE THOUSAND APPLICANTS FROM POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES RANGING FROM PETTY THEFT TO MURDER. SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO ROLL BACK POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND WE ASK FOR YOU TO OPPOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. IN OPPOSITION. NAME IN ORGANIZATIONS. MEDI HIGHER CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND STRONG OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU. MEASURE MEMBERS CHORUS ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. EMILY HARRIS OF ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] BOB. I'M REALLY CONFUSED -- HEAD. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER QUIRK. ALL RIGHT -- FIRST HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR CELLS YELLOW IF YOU COULD COME FORWARD. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ACLU AS WELL. I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS. OKAY SO MISTER SELLS YELLOW -- WHAT IS THE EXACT NATURE OF THE OBJECTION FROM THE SHERIFF'S? THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL RESPECTFULLY IS THE CONCERN WE HAD WITH THE PRIOR BILL -- THAT THE THE FRANKLY LAW ENFORCEMENT MANAGEMENT SPECIFICALLY -- TAKES A LOT OF TRYING TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD -- BUT CONCERN OR WHATEVER -- THAT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH TO DISCIPLINE OFFICERS WHO ARE WORTHY OF DISCIPLINE AND SO IN IN THIS CONTEXT AND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER BILLS THIS IS NOT THE ONLY BILL. WITH THE BILLS THAT ATTEMPT TO EXPAND EMPLOYEE RIGHTS FURTHER UNDER. FULL BORE WERE SENSITIVE -- TO AND SO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL UP THE RIGHT TO HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AGAIN MAY CAUSE AN INVESTIGATION OF ON NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS MERITORIOUS TO THE DISCIPLINE ITSELF THAT WAS TO THE ACTION HAPPEN OR DID IT NOT AND WAS THE DISCIPLINE APPROPRIATE BUT IF YOU DIDN'T PROVIDE THE RIGHT INFORMATION AT THE RIGHT TIME IS THAT. THE TECHNICAL GROUNDS FOR THROWING OUT THE DISCIPLINE. OKAY BUT THERE'S ALREADY. A REQUIREMENT TO SAY. TO INFORM THE OFFICER OF THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE AND THE OF THE CHARGE AND TO GIVE THAT IN ADVANCE -- SO THIS IS JUST DEFINING WHAT THAT INFORMATION WISE YOU COULD PRESUMABLY. PUTTING AMENDMENT IN THE BILL WHICH WOULD SAY IF THAT INFORMATION ISN'T AVAILABLE. OR THERE'S AN HONEST MISTAKE IN GIVING THE DATE AT SAID OR YOU COULD WRITE THE BILL IN THAT WAY. THIS IS THEY ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT FOR SOME INFORMATION THIS IS JUST DEFINING AT OUR IF THERE WERE SOMETHING PUT IN THE BILL SUCH THAT -- DO YOU THINK THIS IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN OR DO YOU. YOU KNOW IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH COULD THIS BE THEN -- REMEDY BY AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL IF SAYING THAT -- IF THE DATE WASN'T KNOWN OR IF THE INFORMATION WASN'T KNOWN IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE GIVEN. IT'S NOT IT THROUGH THE CHURCH ON AMENDMENT WE'VE SUGGESTED IF IT WERE ON THE TABLE WE CERTAINLY CONSIDER BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IN STAFF -- BUT THE BILL BEFORE US IS WHAT BEFORE ISN'T EITHER IT DOES SOMETHING EITHER IT EXPANDS THE INFORMATION THAT HAS TO BE GIVEN. OR IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IF IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING BEN NOT SURE WHY WE NEED A BILL EIGHT BUT IN YOUR OPINION THIS DOES EXPAND THE INFORMATION. YEAH THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT GENERAL NATURE ME I THINK BY THE FACT THAT THERE'S A BILL HERE IT EXPANDS WHAT HAS TO BE GIVEN. I SEE ALL RIGHT WELL IT MAKES SENSE THANK YOU -- A FOR THE ACLU. SO -- YOUR NAME AGAIN IS. LIZZY. LIZZY YOU CAN YOU CAN OKAY -- SO DO YOU LOOK AT THIS IS AN EXPANSION OF THE INFORMATION OR I THINK IT -- I MEAN I I AGREE WITH MR SAYS BILLS ALSO -- THAT -- YOU KNOW IT IS. A BILL BEFORE FOR THIS COMMITTEE I THINK IT CERTAINLY CAN BE READ AS AN EXPANSION I THINK THAT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THE NATURE OF THE OFFENSE ISN'T TO FIND. I THINK AS I SAID OFTEN THE DATE TIME AND DATE THAT THE INFORMATION IS GIVEN LOCATION DEPENDS HOW HOW WE WOULD DEFINE A GENERAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CONDUCT -- AND AND AND SO I THINK THAT IT. IT'S CAN CERTAINLY BE INTERPRETED AS AS AN EXPANSION. YOU YOU WOULD INTERPRET IS AS AN EXPANSION YES. ALL RIGHT -- THANK YOU I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THEN. IS MISSPELLED ON MR LOVELL SO YOU MENTIONED AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS THE WAY IT'S DONE IN PRACTICE BUT FOR PURPOSES OF LAW. AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY PROCEEDINGS WHERE THERE'S ALSO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN NATURE. AS I READ THE BILL THERE'S TWO CLAUSES THAT NARROW IT THERE IS THE OPENING PARAGRAPH AND THEN SECTION J.. SECTION JAY SAYS THAT THE SECTION TURNS SOLELY WITH CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES SO AS I READ THAT IF THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BEING INVESTIGATED THIS WOULD APPLY IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING. SO ERTAINLY IN THIS WAS TOUCH UPON BY THE OPPOSITION THIS DOESN'T PRECLUDE IF IN IT IF. THE OFFICERS BROUGHT IN ON AN ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE. AND ONE SIDE INVESTIGATION AND SUSAN QUESTIONING BEGINS AND THEN IT TRANSITIONS INTO ANOTHER ISSUE THAT MAY HAVE CRIMINALITY THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT PRECLUDES THAT FROM HAPPENING. A TIME OUT IS GIVEN THE RIDDLER WERE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO TALK WITH HER LABOR REPRESENTATIVE OR THEIR WITH THEIR ATTORNEY AT SAID IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE OR STOP ANY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT MY CONCERN SO HERE'S MY CONCERN ON THE HYPOTHETICAL WE HAVE A POLICE OFFICER IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR SEVERAL THINGS SUMMER THE MINOR THINGS THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED. IN ADDITION THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS OF SAY SEXUAL ASSAULT. THE INVESTIGATOR KNOWS OF ONE ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT LET'S SAY THEY WERE FIVE SEXUAL ASSAULT INCIDENTS WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS OFFICER KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THE INVESTIGATOR KNOWS IT LIMITS THE INVESTIGATORS ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND. THE SCOPE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SO BY GIVING THIS MUCH INFORMATION I THINK WE'VE NOW. HAND CUFF TO THE INVESTIGATOR INTO REALLY GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT'S GOING ON NOT ALL ALL INTERJECT ON THAT -- IN AND WITH REASON IS I SAW WAS A CAPTAIN FOR THIRTY YEARS I WAS A MANAGER CITED HIS INVESTIGATION SUFFERS A SERIOUS CHARGES RATE. THAT BE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IT WOULD NOT BE IN THE MINISTRY OF INVESTIGATION. RACE SO WHERE ANALYZE THAT STATED THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS I READ THIS LAW YOU COULD HAVE BOTH HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY RIGHT NO AND I UNDERSTAND A PRACTICE THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN WHAT I'M SAYING THOUGH IF IT'S I UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF AN ALLEGATION SURFACES A FELONY OR SERIOUS CRIME? IT WILL BE TREATED AS A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION NOT THE MYSTERY INVESTIGATION THAT'S THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE. AND THAT WE REPRESENTS FROM C. H. P. AND OTHER AGENCIES IN HERE THAT CAN TALK ABOUT THAT BUT IF THAT ALLEGATION SURFACES. IT'S GOING TO BE TREATED AS SUCH NOT A LESSER NOT A LESSER YOU GOT MORE SERIOUS CRIME. RIGHT I I UNDERSTAND YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE VASTLY MORE EXPERIENCE HIGH TO MISTER COOPER AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T. I JUST I'M VOTING ON A BILL TO GIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS RIGHT AND THAT'S MY CONCERN SO WHATEVER'S HAPPENING PRACTICES ONE THING I RESPECT THAT. BUT THIS ESTABLISHES LAW AND AS I READ THE OPENING PARAGRAPH IT CAN APPLY TO ANY ACTION THAT LEADS TO DISMISSAL THIS MOTION SUSPENSION REDUCTION SALARY WRITTEN REPRIMANDED TRANSFER FOR THE PURPOSES OF PUNISHMENT EXCLUDE THINGS THAT ARE SOLELY CRIMINAL. BUT NOT THINGS THAT ARE MIXED IN NATURE. CAN YOU EXPLAIN IF I'M MISREADING IT PLEASE SO THIS DOES NOTHING TO IT TO IMPACT. ADVERSELY A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION I THINK AGAIN NOTHING YOUR CONCERNS ARE STILL GOING TO BE. THERE ALREADY BEING ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER STILL GONNA BE BROUGHT UP ON CRIMINAL CHARGES THERE'S GOING TO BE A SEPARATE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THIS BILL DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO IMPACT THAT INVESTIGATION ALL THIS IS DOING IN THIS IS NOT ADDING ANYTHING IT'S NOT AN EXPANSION. THE COURT THERE'S BEEN TWO COURT CASES ALREADY IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR RECORDING HINRICH VERSUS THE COUNTY OF ORANGE SAYS AT A MINIMUM A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ALLEGATIONS MUST BE GIVEN. LATER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ALAN'S VERSUS THE CITY IS CITY OF SIERRA MADRE A DISCLOSURE SAID INFORMATION MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED REASONABLY PRIOR ANY INTERROGATION. THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING LAW THE PROBLEM IS IN PRACTICE THERE'S NO EXPANSION. I I JUST I I THINK IT USED TO BE WERE WERE BASICALLY HIT. HERE IN SUPPORT OWN IN CLARIFYING. WHAT IS CURRENT LAW IN A SPACES NESSA'S A MEAN THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE WHAT IS ALREADY EXISTING LAW THAT IS NOT BEING? EXECUTED TO THEIR CURRENT LAW THAT REQUIRES AS MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE INCIDENT BE GIVEN TO AN OFFICER. IS TO SAY THAT AGAIN OF HIS THEIR CURRENT LAW THAT REQUIRES THAT THIS MUCH DETAIL BE GIVEN TO AN OFFICER. SHOW AS RELATED TO THE INFORMAL IS AGENCIES ARE TO OUR OUR DETERMINE ERROR OR THERE DISCERNING THIS DIFFERENTLY WE HAVE AGENCIES ALL OVER THE STATE THERE ARE DID THEIR DEFINING IT ONE WAY AND OTHER AGENCIES DEFINING IT ANOTHER LARGER AGENCIES ARE BETTER ABOUT DEFINING IN PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION SOME. OF THE SMALLER AGENCIES ARE NOT THE MESS I AND THAT'S THE ISSUE WITH A SMALLER AGENCIES MISTRESSES ELLO MISSPOKE MOST HERE LARGE SHARES DEPARTMENT PLEASE DEPARTMENTS. PROVIDE YOU WITH THE INFORMATION BECAUSE SOMEONE COMES IN THIS REAL ISSUE COMES OUT A TIMELINESS YOU WANT INVESTIGATION DONE A TIMELY MANNER IF YOU COME IN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN AND WHERE. THEN OKAY LET'S TAKE A TIME OUT. AND YOU GO BACK TO THEN IS DELAYED SOMETIMES WEEKS SOMETIMES MONTHS THAT'S WITH THE BEEN THE BIGGEST ISSUE COME IN FOR INSTANCE MOST IS COMPLETE THIS BE HONEST. IT IS FOR HIS COURTEOUS TREATMENT OVER HALF PROBABLY MUCH HIGHER I STOPPED YOU FOR TRAFFIC VIOLATION YOU MAY COMPLETE L. DISCOURTEOUS WHELP. PHARMACIES P. OFFICER I MAYBE TWELVE OR FIFTEEN STOP IN TODAY. SEE TELL ME ON THIS DATE IN MAY THE STOP SO WHAT INTERROGATION ALL ASKING FOR IS. THE TIME TO DO THE INCIDENT. THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT. AND THAT'S IT AND IF TO AFFAIRS NUMBER TO FIND OUT SO THAT WAY YOU TELL ME IN SO THEY CAN GO BACK AND WE HAVE A TICKET THAT DID THEY WROTE THEY WROTE NOTES IN THE BACK OF THE TICKET WHICH CHP DOES. MR LACKEY WILL TESTIFY THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH CASE VERSUS HAVING TWELVE SEPARATE CASES YOU DON'T KNOW. SO IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THAT AND IF IT'S A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION NUMBER ONE THERE TO START A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION NOT RELY A WITH DETECTIVES COLONEL INVESTORS THAT DO THAT. IN THAT CASE IS REFERRED THE DA'S OFFICE DOES NOT HANDLE INTERNALLY IF IT'S IF CRIMINAL CONDUCT A SUSPECTED SO YOU HAVE. INVESTIGATORS INVESTIGATE THAT NOT NOT AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS TOTALLY SEPARATE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS DO THAT DO THE INVESTIGATION EVERY FOR TODAY'S OFFICE FOR PROSECUTION. SO IT'S A REALLY IT'S A REALLY AS TWO SEPARATE ISSUES OKAY. CONNECT WITH PROMOTED OF SO -- THANK YOU ALL FOR IT THIS CONVERSATION. SO TO CLARIFY I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR IF THESE THINGS ARE NOT PROVIDED AS YOU ARE -- ASKING THAT THEY BE. SAY AGAIN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE COMPLAINT. IF WHAT MODESTO IF YOU'RE NOT GIVEN THE TIME THE DATE OF THE INCIDENT THE LOCATION SO IF THOSE THINGS ARE NOT. BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE REQUESTING IN THIS LAW IF THEY ARE NOT PROVIDED THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE COMPLAINT WOULD BE DISMISSED SO IT WOULD BE CONTINUED SO MAJORITIES CASES THAT INVOLVE DISCIPLINE. IT A LOWER LEVEL WE'RE TALKING LOWER LEVEL DISCIPLINE SO CORRECTIVE ACTION MAYBE DOCUMENT COUNSELING SO WE KNOW MOST OF THESE ARE. I'LL BE HONEST SICK LEAVE ABUSE COMPUTER ACCESS -- CONNECTING TO COMING ON THE COMING OF OF AN OFFICER AND DISCOURTEOUS TREATMENT THINGS LIKE THAT. SO YOU GIVE ME INFORMATION -- WISE IF YOU SAY WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. THE COMING WILL WE CAN ASK THIS QUESTION LET'S CONTINUE THE CASE SO YOU GOTTA YOU REPRESENTATIVE THEY HAVE TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT OKAY WILL COME BACK IN TWO WEEKS OR MONTHS. MY SCHEDULE AVAILABLE WEATHER SO YOU REPRESENTED OR ATTORNEY OR I FOR THAT MATTER SO IF YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION IS DONE THAT DAY. IF WE'RE WE'RE DOES NOT PUT OFFICE NOT CONTINUE. BUT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE CORRECT INFORMATION YOU CAN'T COME. AND TELL WHAT HAPPENED YOU MISS BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER THAT I DO FIFTEEN TRAFFIC STOP TODAY. HOW MY GONNA MEMBER WHO WAS RUDE TO STILL ALL DOES IS NARROW IT DOWN AND AND I THINK ABOUT THIS THE DAY IN TIME OF THE INCIDENT? THE LOCATION OF THE ACCIDENT. THAT'S OUR ASKING. FOR NOTHING ELSE AND WHAT BEEN WITH A SMALL APARTMENT THE WEATHER BE USING THIS TO THE SMALL DEPARTMENTS SO LARGER AGENCY YOU CAN GO TO COURT AND SUED. MUST LAWLER TO SEE IF YOUR RIGHTS ARE BEING VIOLATED YOU CAN'T GO TO COURT AND SUE. NEST WE'VE BEEN THE BIG ISSUE WORDS HAPPEN TO THE SMARTEST BIGGEST HE'S DO ALREADY. WELL AND SO -- IN MANY OF THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU ALL HAVE GIVEN THE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC. RATE CORRECT THE ALL TIME OR SOMETIMES PHILOSOPHY AND ALL OFFICER YES OKAY SO THAT WAS SORT OF MY SECOND QUESTION BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS WE HAVE A SAYING. SNITCHES GET STAGES AND SO. I WONDER IF YOU CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO KIND OF TRIANGULATED WHO MAYBE YOUR FELLOW OFFICER IS WHO'S LODGED A COMPLAINT. AND THAT COULD THEN ALSO IMPEDE YOU KNOW THE INTEGRITY OF THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE I WOULD ASSUME THAT IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE. TO LODGE A COMPLAINT AGAINST A FELLOW OFFICER IN WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT -- BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A CLOSE KNIT COMMUNITY AND YOU YOU LIVE LIVES ARE ON THE LINE ALL THE TIME IT PROBABLY DOES TAKE A ACT OF COURAGE TO SAY I'M GONNA STEP UP. AND SAY SOMETHING OR WATCH COMPLAINT AGAINST INSTANCE IF THEY THEN HAD THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU COULD TRIANGULATE WHO YOUR FELLOW OFFICER IS AND THEN LIKE YOU KNOW MEET ME IN THE CORNER ON YOU KNOW THREE O'CLOCK WE ARE. WHICH IN WHICH ALSO COMPROMISES THE ABILITY TO HAVE [inaudible] A HEALTHY. ACTIVE ROBUST WORK FORCE WHERE FOLKS ARE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE TUESDAY TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS IT'S NOT TELLING YOU WHO FILED THE COMPLAINT. JUST TELLING WHAT HAPPENED SO COULD BE OFF THREE COULD BE THE PERSON THAT WAS [inaudible] THE VICTIM. SO IT COULD BE A COME FROM RIGHT -- VARIETY OF SOURCES SO WE OFFER DOESN'T KNOW WHO TO COMPLAIN IS. AND THEN IS THIS THIS IS CODIFIES WHAT'S ALREADY IN LAW AND IT IT IT SAYS IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE CODIFIED BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE KNOW CHOOSE THE BUTTE THAT AND NOT FOLLOW IT. A MISTER LACKEY IN AND MISS WORK. GET THE LET ME FIRST OFF SAY THAT -- I FEEL VERY QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC I MEAN EIGHTEEN IN MY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS WAS. SERVING AS OF THE FRONTLINE SUPERVISOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AND THE MAJORITY OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS ALREADY PART OF THE AGENCY I WORK FORCE POLICY. SO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS NOT EXPANSION IT IS CLEARLY A CLARIFICATION OR INTERPRETATION. THAT OTHER AGENCIES. DO NOT AFFORD. CERTAIN OFFICERS WHICH CLEARLY. I THINK THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE DOES NOT ONLY APPLY TO PEOPLE UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION -- IT HAS TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT TENET. THAT. WHEN ALLEGATIONS ARE BROUGHT FORWARD THAT THEY REALLY DID OCCUR? AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE KINDS OF REQUESTS OR ARE PARTS OF THE INVESTIGATION I THINK ALL IT DOES IS STRENGTHENED. THE VERACITY OF THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION AND SO I I I THINK IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT UNFAIRLY CHARACTERIZED BY SOME MY COLLEAGUES A KID APPEAR. WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS AND SO I WILL TELL YOU THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IS? IS NOT ONLY REASONABLE BUT PROBABLY NO PORTENT THINK YOUR AND IT SHOULD IT. I JUST WANNA KNOW. BASICALLY WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ASKING ABOUT THE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS CASE NUMBER. I JUST THAT SOMETHING NEW TO ME AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ITS RELEVANCE AS A LIEN HAS A FOR THEIR RECORDS. SEE THE KEEP TRACK OF IT. WILL THIS IS THIS THE BEST TO GAZE AT THIS POINT DOES NOT COME IT'S NOT COMPLETE. SO WHY WOULD THE CASE NUMBER BE OF IMPORTANCE [inaudible] RIGHT. NOW IF WE WANNA MAKE SURE KEEP TRACK OF WHAT CASE IT IS. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU. BUT BUT A ALSO I JUST FALL WITH YOU MISTER LACKEY I MEAN THIS TO BE HONEST THIS THIS IS A LABOR BILL. THIS THE LABOR BILL THE REASON IS HERE THEM ALL PUBLIC SAFETY OTHER LESBIAN LABOR COMMITTEE. THAT'S WHAT A BILL HERE IS LIKE A TEACHER FOR TEACHERS ACCUSED OF SOMETHING THEY COME IN. THERE TOLD A LOT FARMER TOLD A LOT THROUGH LAW THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE TOLD IN THEIR CASES IN LABOR WHEREVER YOU ARE THIS IS A SEVENTY LAW ENFORCEMENT. LASTING FOR A LOT [inaudible] MS WORKS. YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO WE'VE HEARD I THINK DIFFERENT OPINIONS HERE SOME FOLKS BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN EXPANSION OF RIGHTS AND SOME FOLKS THINK THIS SORT OF NOT. IS IT YOUR OPINION MISTER COOPER THAT THIS IS CODIFYING IT IS NOT AN EXPANSION OF RATES RIGHT SO A BIG AGENCY FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR CHP OFFICER. HAVE A BIG ENOUGH SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS SO IF THE COMMISSIONER WAS DOING THAT. THE UNION CONSUME GO TO COURT IF YOU WORK FIRST COMMERCENTRE HUNDRED OFFICERS YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GO A FIGHT IN COURT TO DO THAT. SO IF YOU'RE FROM A SMALL ISSUE YOU'RE BASICALLY SCREWED AND AND ONE OTHER QUESTION. IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR THAT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO CRIMINAL DISCIPLINE CORRECT AND THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SITTING YEARS WHOSE NAME ESCAPES ME KILLINGS THE BACK OF HIS HEAD SO I APOLOGIZE -- HAD SAID EARLIER THAT OR HEIGHTENED ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINE RIGHT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN HEIGHT ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINE AND MORE LOWER LEVEL WHERE WHAT IS THAT YOU WOULD WEAR ADELINE OR SOMETHING SIR SHOULD BE AN ADMIN LEAVE IF IF WE CAN CONSIDER IS OF SERIOUS NATURE. AND WE PUT PEOPLE AND LEAVE ALL THE TIME. SO WHAT ONLINE NO ON THOSE FOR SORT OF MORE RUN OF THE MILL OR TO CITY. IN CASES LIKE THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN CORRECTIVE ACTION OR MAYBE A DOCKING ACCOUNTS AND WITH THE REP A LETTER WRITTEN REPRIMAND SO THE LOWEST LEVEL POSSIBLE THAT THAT BE LINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. IT IS A QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MOST COOPER SO FOR LOT TESTIMONY -- NO TWELVE THOUSAND OFFICERS THAT WERE COMMITTED PETTY THEFT AND MURDER THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL CASE NUMBER. ONE IS DOESN'T EXPAND IT CODIFIES IT. AND IS NOT EVADING ACCOUNTABILITY IT IS IT LIKE SAID THIS COMES DOWN TO IT THESE FOLKS ARE UNION MEMBERS. WE WANT TO MAKE IT WORK. AND THE VAST MAJORITY THESE CASES. INVOLVED. COURTEOUS TREATMENT A PUBLIC. CONDUCT UNBECOMING AN OFFICER SICK LEAVE COMPUTER ACCESS. ITEMS LIKE THAT IMPORTS OF MAINTAINING GOOD EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIPS IS PARAMOUNT IN A HARMONIOUS FAIR PRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE. AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN WILSHIRE THAT ONE A PEACE OFFICER IS NOTIFIED OF A NON CRIMINAL MINISTRY COMPLAINT. THERE FOR THE MIDDLE INFORMATION TO EFFECTIVELY PREPARE FOR DIRECT INACCURATE BOSSES. AB ONE THIRTY SEVERAL ALSO SURE THE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND HIS OR HER UNION REP -- CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ORGANIZATION SPREAD PRESENTATION. AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN SHARES AT PEACE OFFICERS ARE MEMBERS. UP I ACCEPT YOURS AMENDMENTS ANNA AND I JUST WANNA GO BACK ONE MORE TIME FOR FOR MY FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO RIGHT NOW THE LAW SAYS INFORMED OF THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION PART TO INTERROGATION ALL I'M ASKING. FOR IS THE TIME AND DATE OF THE ANY INCIDENT [inaudible] AT ISSUE. THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT WORD OCCURRED. AND THE CASE NUMBER. THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR AND I I DON'T THINK THAT'S TOO MUCH WITH YOUR TEACHER. DELEGATION UP IN THIS CLASSROOM ON THIS DATE THERE'S NOT A BIG DIFFERENCE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A A SET OF RULES. THAT WE JUST APPROVED HERE IN COMMITTEE AND THERE'S A SET OF RULES THAT ARE WRITTEN DOWN ONE MINDS IF THE DON'T TALK PASSED THE S.. THE COMPANION TO THAT IS DON'T CALL PASSED KNOW. AND SO DO A LOT OF QUESTIONS WOULD MEMBERS HERE WHO ARE CHORE. WHERE THEY WERE? AND I WAS HOPING THAT. WE COULD SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME DISCUSSING IT NOT NECESSARILY IN HERE BECAUSE WE ARE WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. AND THIS SEEMS TO BE STILL MEMBERS [inaudible] THAT HAVE. THAT HAVE SOME SOME SOME ISSUES AND PROBABLY SOME MORE QUESTIONS. OF EVEN MORE PERPLEXING TO CD ACLU IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ON SAME. IT'S EVEN MORE CONFUSING -- AND SO -- I I I HOPE WE COULD HAVE. GIVEN MAYBE A LITTLE MORE TIME WEEK FOR THIS TO TO DO THIS IN THE AUTHOR HAS THE DISCRETION TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT SO. I'M I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS NOW AND I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE AND GO OVERTHAT AND SO I'M I'M GOING TO ABSTAIN -- MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME UP EVEN. FOR MISTER LACKEY -- SAID IT THIS COULD BE A LITTLE MORE BAKER. MISTER CHAIR PERHAPS IF THE AUTHOR. WERE WILLING TO WAIT A WEEK AND TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT PARTICULARLY WITH THE SHERIFF'S -- AND AND WE BETTER WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE AND PERHAPS RESOLVE THEM -- RATHER THAN TAKE A VOTE NOW. IT'S UP TO YOU IN THE AUTHOR BUT I WHAT I OFFER THAT TO THE AUTHOR. BEFORE WE EVEN CAME IN SO THAT HE DECIDED HE WOULD COME AND HE DID SOUND LIKE YOU STILL HAVE A SECOND OFFER. OFFERED FEW WOULD LIKE. WHAT WE CAN DO THAT I MEAN THE ALBION'S MISTER QUIRK THE CHEESE OR NEUTRAL -- THE SHERIFF'S -- SHERIFF'S THAT DON'T REALLY DO ANYTHING THEY NEVER COME WHEN ON ANYTHING TO BE HONEST. SO -- WE CAN DO THAT THIS BILL PASSED OUT HERE TWO YEARS AGO AT THE PASSED THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY SUCCESSFULLY -- SO I DON'T I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT DOES -- HOW MUCH AWAY THEN I I'M WILLING TO DO THAT? BUT IT'S HARD. TO DO WHEN YOU COME UP HERE IN IN HEARING YOU DEAL WITH FACT AND DEAL WITH FICTION SO THAT'S THAT'S THE TOUGH PART SO I'M WELL I'M WELL I'M GOING TO HOLD OFF IF YOU. DON'T HAVE MUCH YOU NEED. TO SO IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO VOTE WOULD TAKE ABOUT. WHAT BALL IF YOU GUYS HAVE MORE QUESTIONS -- AT THE PLEASE ASK I WOULD ALWAYS I'LL BE HONEST AS FAR AS I THINK MY OFFICE.

TO CHAIRMAN MOVE THE BELL SECOND. MEMBER THE FIRST RULE. DON'T TALK PASSED BEYOND. WHAT -- I WILL PROCEED BECAUSE THIS IS PRETTY IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE THE MOTION. I'VE INTRODUCED AJ ARE FOR TO URGE CONGRESS TO SWIFTLY PASSED HOUSE RESOLUTION EIGHT THE BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED LAWS TO REQUIRE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WITHOUT ANY LOOPHOLES. THIS LAW HELPS REDUCE THE TRAGEDIES OF GUN VIOLENCE BY KEEPING FIREMAN FIRE ARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. HOWEVER. UNTIL WE BRING THIS EFFECTIVE FIREARM POLICY TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY A DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE IN FEDERAL GUN LAWS STILL EXEMPTS UNLICENSED SELLERS FROM HAVING TO PERFORM ANY BACKGROUND CHECKS WHATSOEVER. BEFORE SELLING A FIREARM. THIS GAP IN FEDERAL LAW LEAVES PEOPLE EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA SUBJECT TO THE DANGERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO NOT WHO CANNOT PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK. OBTAINING FAR ARMS FROM UNLICENSED SELLERS FROM OUT OF STATE. THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ENSURING THAT GUNS ARE NOT SOLD TO PROHIBITED PEOPLE IS THROUGH A NATIONAL UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. AT THIS POINT OF AT THE POINT OF TRANSFER OF ANY FIREARM. BY PASSING AJ OUR FOR OUR CALIFORNIA LEADERS IN CONGRESS AND OUR PRESIDENT WILL RECEIVE THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR THE CALIFORNIA FORMALLY AND PUBLICLY THEM DEMANDS. THE SPEEDY PASSAGE IS THEN SIGNING OF H. R. [inaudible] EIGHT THANK YOU. AMANDA WILCOX AGAIN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. I'M VERY PLEASED THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS BEFORE YOU TODAY. AS TOMORROW IS THE TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BRADY BILL. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BRADY BILL BACK IN THE EARLY NINETIES. ALSO TOMORROW WILL BE THE VOTE ON HR EIGHT IN THE HOUSE AND THE FULL HOUSE. OF ONE OF THE FIRST VOTES IN THE CHAMBER PIECE OF FIREARM LEGISLATION. FOR MANY MANY YEARS ACTUALLY SINCE THE NINETIES -- SO THIS IS GOOD TIMING -- TO MOVE THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD -- THE BRADY LAW HAS STOPPED MANY MANY GUN SALES ESTIMATED THREE MILLION PURCHASES HAVE PREVENTED. ON AVERAGE OF THE SIX HUNDRED AND NINETEEN INDIVIDUALS ARE -- PREVENTED FROM BUYING A GUN EVERYDAY -- THAT'S SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER THERE AS YOU KNOW THERE'S CLEARING LOOPHOLES IN THE LAW PRIVATE PARTY TRANSFERS -- IN IN INTERNET CELLS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT LAW UNDER FEDERAL LAW CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND I HAVE TO EMPHASIZE THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. IS THE FOUNDATION OF FOR ALMOST ALL THE OTHER BILLS THAT WE HAVE ENACTED IN THE STATE IT IS THE IMPORTANT POLICY -- CALIFORNIA -- WHICH DOES HAVE THE STRONGEST GUN LAWS AGAIN BUILT ON BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR EVERYBODY WE'VE HAD A 55% -- FIRE MORTALITY RATE KLEIN SINCE OUR HIGH IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THAT'S MORE THAN FOUR TIMES ALMOST FOUR TIMES OTHER DECRYPT DECREASE IN THE REST OF THE NATION -- SO I WOULD CONTEND THAT OUR GUN LAWS WORK BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK CALIFORNIA CANNOT DO IT ALONE WE NEED FEDERAL A LAW TO MAKE SEATS POLICIES NATIONWIDE -- AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES THE SUPPORT -- JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CALLER SHE SAYS HE ASIAN WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT WE'RE UNIQUELY SITUATED BECAUSE ON HAPPILY IN THESE ARE NATIONWIDE STATISTICS.

ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HELLO GERMAN. WELCOME BACK [inaudble] SURE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AGAIN AND TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT ARE. GONNA COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- WITH REGARDS TO THIS -- A JOINT RESOLUTION WE ARE IN OPPOSITION AND THE REASON WE ARE IS THAT -- WE THINK THAT IT IS ASKING IN AND FOCUSING ON SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED MOST RECENTLY MULTIPLE TIMES AS HAVING NO IMPACT ON GUN VIOLENCE AND THAT BEING. UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE REGISTRATION IN PARTICULAR -- STUDIES THAT WE DIDN'T COMMISSION -- STUDIES THAT WERE THE ARE. ARE UP HAD BEEN PEER REVIEWED IN A AND AND OUT THERE ARE ARE POINTING OUT TO THE FACT THAT. TO PUT. AN IMPORTANCE ON THESE THINGS IN ORDER TO REDUCE. GUN VIOLENCE ARE NOT GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND WE'RE INTERESTED IN REDUCING GO PUTTING OUT -- PROGRAMS AND IDEAS THAT THAT AREN'T GOING TO GET TO THE MATTER OF THE ISSUE -- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS. WHO AGREE WITH US AND AND WILL MAKE THEIR THEIR VOICES KNOWN? ON THE FLOOR WHEN THIS -- RESOLUTIONS TAKEN UP IN AND READ -- THERE'S THERE'S ALSO. THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING THEY'RE GONNA BE MANY ISSUES AND I THINK THAT. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US -- TO TO BEGIN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION BASED ON WHAT THE REALITY IS GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE. OTHER OR THERE IS ONE SUPREME COURT CASE THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE SUPREME COURT. TWO MORE THAT ARE THAT ARE PENDING THAT -- LOOK LIKE THE SUPREME COURT IS TAKING -- INTEREST IN. AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC OF ALL OF THE GUN LAWS. AND MAYBE IT'S TIME TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT CRIME CONTROL INSTEAD OF GUN CONTROL THAT AS THESE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED HAVE SHOWN THAT -- ARE AN EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING -- AGAIN A GUN VIOLENCE THANK YOU -- THAT'S SMART OPINION ON THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU GET. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DâN RE WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION ALSO YOUR FIRST YEAR PA TODAY. IN OPPOSITION AJ ARE. FOR STUDIES OF SHOWN THE BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE IN FACT WITH THE STUDY AT A CALIFORNIA THAT MR PERATIS' REFERENCE THAT REALLY COULDN'T SHOWING THAT BENEFIT OF IT. ON THERE'S A MAJOR ENFORCEABILITY ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO BACKGROUNDCHECKS ON PRIVATE TRANSFERS -- WHICH LENDS ITSELF TO US SELECT HAVE. COMMONPLACE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CRIMINAL THAT -- ARE PROHIBITED UNDER THESE TYPES OF LAWS SUCH AS LOADING A GUN YOUR BEST FRIEND THAT DOESN'T MEET A CERTAIN EXEMPTION -- AND SO. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE. HAVE THIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PEOPLE TO NOT BE FAIRLY PROSECUTED ACROSS WHERE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON UTILIZING FIREARMS LAWS THAT ACTUALLY GO AFTER BAD PEOPLE THAT ARE PROHIBITED AND WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS TO DO THAT ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- AND SO LET'S NOT EXPAND THE LAWS THAT ARE ONLY GOOD IMPACT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS CRIMINALS ARE NOT GETTING THEIR FIREARMS THROUGH THROUGH DEALERS THEY'RE GETTING THEM THROUGH ILLICIT MAINS. AND THIS BILL GENERALLY DOES NOT GO AFTER THAT ARE THESE TYPES OF BILL SO WITH THAT WE SAN OPPOSITION THANK YOU I THINK YOU I THINK I FILLED MENTION I'M SAMPRAS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SAM. AND IT IT OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE. I US FOR A VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. SO I DON'T WANT. TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- AS WE ALL KNOW. PROBABLY BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT. SPECIALLY SENSE -- PROBABLY MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE MASS SHOOTINGS. WERE BY LAW ABIDING [inaudible] NO RECORD [inaudible] CITIZENS. AND SOMEHOW WITH MENTAL PROBLEMS IN AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SOME WAY OF CAPTURING THOSE. WE HAVE A WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOK IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH CRIMINALS. WHO HAVE POSSESSION OF WEAPONS -- HOPEFULLY BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL HELP US -- CAPTURE THE DONE A FIVE THOSE WHO DANCE ON THE MOST HEINOUS. FIREARMS CRIMES IN THIS COUNTRY -- SOMEHOW WE NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND HOW TO CAPTURE THAT AND SO I AGREE WITH -- WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE -- TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE GUNS OUT OF HANDS OF CRIMINALS AM AND WE SHOULD AND AND HOPEFULLY ONE DAY. THEY TOO CAN COME WITH LEGISLATION IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN. GET THE GUNS OFF THE STREET AND OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL HARM SOCIETY -- I'M WAITING IN. ONE DAY I MAY SEE THAT SO -- UNTIL THEN -- WE WILL BE WORKING ON BACKGROUND CHECKS AND AND OTHER RESOLUTIONS THAT YEAR YOU'RE PROVIDING WITH THE CHEERS RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

AS CHAIR MEMBERS RANCHERA WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED. THAT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THESE WALL STREET PRIVATE PRISON CASH COWS IS TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISON COMPANIES ACCOMPLICES GOAL BY IMPLEMENTING. RELAX HIRING STANDARDS REDUCE STAFFING LEVELS INADEQUATE EMPLOYEE TRAINING AND BY PAYING THEIR WORKERS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS IN WAGES AND BENEFITS WHEN COMPARED TO PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. AS A RESULT OF THIS TOXIC PROFIT MAXIMIZING FORMULA PRIVATE PRISONS HAVE A SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER RATE OF BOTH IN MADE ON STAFF ASSAULTS. AN INMATE ON INMATE ASSAULTS. IS NOW SEEKING CAR SERRATION CORPORATIONS ARE TRADE ON AND MUST MEET FINANCIAL THE FINANCIAL GOALS. OF THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AS A CEO OF CORRECTIONS CORPORATION OF AMERICA NOW CALLED CORE CIVIC ONE STATED. INMATES ARE A COMMODITY IN OUR LINE OF WORK. TREATING INMATES LIKE COMMODITIES MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL TO THE BOTTOM LINE OF THESE CORPORATIONS BUT DOES LITTLE TO REHABILITATE INMATES OR PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY. UPON THE RELEASE OF THEIR COME THEIR COMMODITIES BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. ACADEMIC STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN THE RECIDIVISM RATE IS HIGHER FOR FOR PROFIT PRISONS -- INMATES WHEN COMPARED TO PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC FACILITIES. OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT REPORTS IN ADDITION TO THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS ARE JUST AS EXPENSIVE. AND SOMETIMES MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PUBLICLY OPERATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS. PRIVATE FOR PROFIT PRISONS HAVE ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO ENDANGER THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY RESIDE. A TEN YEAR STUDY OF PRISON ESCAPES. SHOWED THAT FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS HAD TWENTY TIMES THE NUMBER OF ESCAPES. FROM SECURE FACILITIES THAN THOSE FROM CDC ARE. PRIVATE PRISON COMPANIES. LOWER THE BAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE CORRECTIONS PROFESSION AND WHILE WE IN THE PRIVATE AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS THE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT CORPORATIONS SEEK ONLY TO IMPROVE PROFITS. AND THE FOR THOSE REASONS RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION STRONGLY. SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL IN A POST PRIVATE PRISONS THANK YOU THANK YOU -- JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. OF CALIFORNIA SISSY ATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

THANK YOU [inaudible] AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COULD YOU MAKE A CORY CELLS LOWER YOUR ALL OVER THE MAP TODAY ON MY DAY IN THE BOOK. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST COURCELLES ELLO HERE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION -- RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OUR CONCERN IS NOT ONE ABOUT THE THE PROPRIETY OF THE MERITS OF PRIVATE PRISONS OR PUBLIC PRISONS OR JAILS OR WHATEVER. OUR CONCERN IS THAT REMOVING A TOOL -- IN CDC OURS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS OVERCROWDING THAT THEY HAVE DONE -- WITH I WOULD SAY SOME SO THE LAST SEVEN EIGHT YEARS TO ADDRESS -- COURT ORDERED POPULATION REDUCTIONS -- WE'RE TAKING AWAY TOOL THAT HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN THAT EFFORT -- I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE CASE FOR OTHER. USES OR METHODS OR APPROACHES IN AND REALLY THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE WHAT WHAT WE WHAT WE SEE POTENTIALLY HAPPEN AND IS ONE OF TWO THINGS -- ONE IF WE TAKE AWAY TOOL TO DEAL WITH OVERCROWDING. WE DON'T ADDRESS THE OVERCROWDING AND WE END UP WITH PEOPLE BEING RELEASED UNDER THE EXISTING THREE JUDGE ORDER -- THAT HAS ALREADY PUT IN PLACE A COMPLIANCE OFFICER WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO RELEASE PEOPLE AND SO IF THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE -- THAT BECOMES A POSSIBILITY THE OTHERS SONORA THAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AND I WOULD SAY TOO MUCH HIGHER DEGREE. IS ONE THAT INCREASES PRESSURE TO HOUSE MORE FELONS AND COUNTY JAILS SO WE'VE PARTNERED WITH THE STATE -- TO TRY TO APPROPRIATELY HOUSE OFFENDERS WE'VE DONE THAT WE HAVE -- FELONS IN OUR JAILS THAT WE DID WE GET PAID WE'RE FLYING BUT UNDERTAKEN THAT AS BECAUSE CHALLENGES AND AND WE'RE DEALING WITH THOSE CHALLENGES AND YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED FUNDS TO REHABILITATE AND RENOVATE FACILITIES. TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING MISSION OF JAILS OVER THE YEARS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT CERTAINLY. BUT WE ARE FACING CHALLENGES FROM THE DIFFERENT INMATE FELON POPULATION THAT WE HAVE NOW AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT IF AGAIN IF WE TAKE A TOOL OUT OF THE TOOL BOX THAT CREATES MORE PRESSURE TO SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT COUNTY JAILS. AS AN OPTION NOW TO PUT THESE PEOPLE AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM IN PRIVATE PRISONS AREN'T SAYING THAT HAVING A STATE PUBLIC PRISON OR HAVING THEM IN SOME OTHER TYPE OF PROGRAM OR SOME OTHER ENVIRONMENT. AND AND FRANKLY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THIS INCREASED PRESSURE TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAILS -- WITHOUT THE PROPER STAFFING WITHOUT THE PROPER FUNDING WITHOUT THE PROPER FACILITIES AND PROGRAMMING SO BASED ON THOSE TWO CONCERNS WERE OPPOSED THE BILL THANK. THANK YOU OF AN EMAIL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AS THERE WAS ONE THING -- BROUGHT UP. AND THAT IS THAT IN SOME CASES. ARE CDC ARE WILL RUN A PRISON THAT IS OF RENTED FROM A PRIVATE BUSINESS. I DO THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY OKAY -- WHAT DO YOU WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION THERE? ONE ZERO OPERATED BY YEAH SO THEY'RE OPERATED BY THE OTC ARE BUT THERE. ARE ARE ARE FOCUSED WITH THIS BILL IS. FACILITIES PRISONS THAT ARE OPERATED BY FOR PROFIT PRIVATE OKAY SO COMPANIES IF THEY LEASE THE LAND IT'S BASICALLY -- IT'S IT'S A LAND ARRANGEMENT BUT IT'S RUN BY IS OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY COMMITMENT TO REHABILITATION REENTRY -- LAURIE RE RECIDIVISM RATES THAN THAT'S NOT OUR FOCUS IN THE BILL PERFECT THANK YOU. MR LACKEY YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY I ALSO TO WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN OUR OFFICES. AND YOUR OPENNESS TO AMEND THE BILL TO THE POINT WHERE I GET TO A SUPPORT RIGHT NOW I'LL BE -- NOT. FORTY YOU FOR THE PRODUCT OF CONVERSATION STRIKING. ARE THERE ANY OTHER. THANK YOU MAKE YOU MAY CLOSE. JUST A QUICK POINT ABOUT THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT WHICH I UNDERSTAND BUT I ALSO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH -- I UNDERSTAND THIS WAS SEEN AS A TOOL WHEN WE HAD A COURT ORDERED CAP I THINK IT WAS WRONG TO USE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS THAN. I EVEN MORE WRONG NOW BECAUSE WERE BENEATH THE CAP WE DON'T WE DON'T NEED. TO USE THEM AND WE HAVE CAPACITY IN OUR EXISTING FACILITIES THROUGHOUT. THE STATE WE WE WE GOT A LIST OF RATED CAPACITY AND THERE'S LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF BEDS THOUSANDS OF BEDS -- AT PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT HAVE PROGRAMMING AND TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT THAT WE COULD USE -- IF NECESSARY WITH THAT WITH THE APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENT CELL WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT I I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THAT -- AND EVEN AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT. THIS IS ABOUT STANDING WITH OUR VALUES IN CALIFORNIA DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR CALIFORNIA AND IT'S BEST TO HAVE. A STRONG SUPPORT SOME PROGRAMS THAT ARE COMMITTED TO REHABILITATION AND ARE RE ENTRY IN THE REAR -- RECIDIVISM RATES AND DIE FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. THIRTY TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU AND HAVE BEEN PART OF THE REASON WHY -- I DID THE AUDIT ON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL. AND I CAN HOPEFULLY. IN MY MY LAST SIX YEARS AGO DOESN'T COME BACK TO HAUNT ME HOPEFULLY IT. AT THE REHABILITATION. PROGRAMS WORK THEY'LL BE FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE BOTH HOPEFULLY IN JAILS AND IN STATE PRISONS SO THAT WE NEVER HAVE THAT PROBLEM WHICH IS JUST OVERCROWDING AT THE STATE LEVEL WHERE THEY HAVE TO START. FIGURING OUT SOMETHING OR HAVE ANOTHER COURT ORDER WHICH IS WHAT I THINK THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS ARE SAYING THAT WE'RE NOW FORCED TO COME UP WITH REMEDIES HOPEFULLY IF IT EVER HAPPENED THAT WE WE DON'T GO BACK TO WHAT. WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH WHICH IS -- GO TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND EVEN AN EMERGENCY -- STATE EMERGENCY AS WE KNOW NATIONAL WHERE DO YOU CAN JUST SAY ANYTHING BUT THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER DISCUSSION. AND THAT THAT WE COME UP WITH THE OUR OVERCROWDING THE WAY WE DID IT I AGREE WITH YOU MISTER BONTA WAS WAS -- WAS WRONG WITH WE WERE JUST. WE WERE JUST SHOOTING FROM THE HIP AND THAT'S WHY -- THAT FIRST NATIONAL PUSHING PEOPLE DOWN TO THE STATE -- BECAME PROBLEMATIC AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TO PROVIDE FUNDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE LOCAL JAIL LEVEL. AND SO -- IF WE DO. REALLY WELL WITH YOU KNOW SEE C. OUR OFFICE NO LONGER BIG ON C. WHICH IS HOUSING PEOPLE AND BASED ON OUR REHABILITATION -- WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO DEPEND ON GOING TO PRIVATE PRESENCE ON RECOMMENDED AND I THANK YOU. ON A. B.

FUN COURT OPERATIONS COURT CONSTRUCTION AND RESTITUTION FUND ONLY AFTER FINDING OF A DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO PAY MOVE THE BELL. SO I WOULD BE REMISS AND BEFORE I GET TOO FAR TODAY'S PRESENTATION -- OUR ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT OF BANKS. ARE TO THE LATE JEFF ADACHI. ARM ELECTED PUBLIC DEFENDER IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO HELPED US THINK THROUGH SOMEBODY THREE WEEKS AGO -- HE WAS A CHAMPION ANY WAS SOMEONE THAT WAS. THAT IS NOT ONLY RESPECTED BUT A HE WAS A TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR THE POOR AND PEOPLE OF COLOR COLOR. JEFF PASSED AWAY UNEXPECTEDLY OVER THE WEEKEND. HIS LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY WE SORELY MESSED. AS FOR THIS BILL TRIAL COURTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ASSESS A NUMBER OF FINES AND FEES WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS CONVICTED OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES INCLUDING TRAFFIC OFFENSES. WHEN A CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES SYSTEM WAS SET UP THE COURTS WERE ALLOWED TO LEVY PENALTY ASSESSMENTS ON BASS FINDS WHICH COULD BE AS MUCH AS? THIRTY FOR EVERY TEN DOLLARS OF THE FINE. BALLING THE GREAT RECESSION STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE INCREASED BINDS TO A LEVY A GENERAL FROM PRESSURE BUT HAVE DONE THIS ON THE BACKS OF POOR DEFENDANTS. IN. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAD AROUND. TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING UNCOLLECTED DEBT. ON JANUARY EIGHTH TWENTY NINETEEN THE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS HELD THAT THE MANDATORY IMPOSITION OF THREE SPECIFIC PINES WITHOUT REGARD FOR DEPENDENTS ABILITY TO PAY. IS A VIOLATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S DUE PROCESS. THAT RULING FOLLOWS A TWENTY SIXTEEN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LETTER THAT NOTES THAT ONE FINDS ARE NOT GEARED TOWARDS PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT RATHER TOWARDS RAISING REVENUE. THEY CAN CAST DOUBT ON THE A PARTIAL -- SYSTEM. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SET FOR TRAFFIC OFFICES WE DON'T GIVEN QUOTAS. IS NOT BASED ON HOW MUCH THEY MAKE ISN'T BASED ON THE ACTUAL INFRACTION. THIS BILL SIMPLY CALL IT CODIFIES THE APPELLATE COURT RULING REQUIRING A FINDING OF ABILITY TO PAY PRIORTO THE ASSESSMENT. OF SELECT FINE MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE AYE VOTE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS MARGO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU -- I JUST WANNA SAY I WAS REALLY TOUCHED BY THE CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS ABOUT JEFF ADACHI. ON HE WAS BOTH A FRIEND AND THE HERO -- FOR US OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR OUR CLIENTS HE WAS A TRUE WARRIOR. AND SO I AM VERY TOUCH THAT YOU DID THAT THANK YOU -- TURNING TO THE A. B. R. -- TWO TWO SEVEN LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS DUANE US WHO IS -- THE SUBJECT OF THE CASE MISS DWAYNE US WAS THE HOMELESS POOR WOMAN WITH YOUNG CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY. AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE FINES FOR DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE WHICH SHE COULD NOT PAY. SHE SPENT OVER FIFTY ONE DAYS ADDITIONAL IN COUNTY JAIL. THAT WAS THE HARDSHIP OF COURSE FOR HER. AND A LOS AND SHE WAS YOU KNOW BASICALLY BEING IMPRISONED FOR HER POVERTY. BUT IT IS ALSO NONSENSICAL BECAUSE IT WAS A LOSS FOR THE TAXPAYERS AS WELL. NOT ONLY DID THERE WAS NO REVENUE COLLECTED WE HAD TO PAY FOR HER TO BE INCARCERATED FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS FOR POVERTY I'M. THE CHAIRMAN SAID THAT BETWEEN US IS THE EXISTING LAW AND AB TWO TWO SEVEN CODIFIES THAT THAT IS CORRECT. UNFORTUNATELY THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS SENT A LETTER TO THE COURT OF APPEAL ASKING THAT THE OPINION BT PUBLISHED. BUT EVEN SO THIS IS EXISTING LAW. JUST LAST WEEK. IN A TIM VERSES -- INDIANA. THE US SUPREME COURT HELD THAT THE PROTECTION AGAINST EXCESSIVE FINES GUARDS AGAINST THE USES OF GOVERNMENTS PUNITIVE OR CRIMINAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. THIS SAFEGUARD WE HOLD IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR SCHEME OF ORDERED LIBERTY. AND AS THE WINNERS COURT SAID IN THEIR OPINION. BECAUSE THE ONLY REASON THE DEFENDANT CANNOT PAY THE FINE AND FEES AS HER POVERTY. USING THE CRIMINAL PROCESS TO COLLECT TO FIND SHE CANNOT PAY IS AN CONSTITUTIONAL. WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. K.. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MANY HAD CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION PRETTY BARE. YOU MAKE ANY -- QUESTIONS FROM [inaudible] APPEAR. WHAT A SHOW NUMBER? IS CHAIRMAN MY GUESS MY IN MY QUESTION. TO YOU IS [inaudible] IF. IF PART OF THE THE ARM OF THE FUN. THAT IS COLLECTED. OF WILL GO INTO. THE VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM -- EIGHT WE ELIMINATE THIS STREAM OF EVER OF REVENUE -- HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THAT THAT VICTIM COMPOSITION PROGRAM? OKAY SO I PUT IT. I BELIEVE THE THE A I DON'T ANSWER ROB THE I CAN FIND OUT DE THE IMPACT ON OUR AYE UP FROM HOPING AND I BELIEVE IT IS NOT GOING TO BE AS I SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS ON COLLECTED. A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T GET MOST MONEY THAT GOES INTO THAT. SPECIALLY CONSIDERS THESE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE THE CAMPAIGN ANYWAY. AND WE JUST DID HOPE PART OF THIS YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THE MONEY ANYWAY SO TO CRIMINALIZE AN AD PENALTIES ON TOP OF THAT. JUST FURTHER PUSHES THAT PERSON IN A PROPERTY THAT THE END OF THE DAY -- AND THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED ABOUT THE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE ON COLLECTED. A LOT OF THAT INVOLVES A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE -- BUT I WILL FOR I'LL GET YOU A I CAN GET YOU A BEFORE WE BEGIN SALAS COMMITTEE I CAN OF FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE IMPACT IS AND WE GO TO APPROPRIATIONS. WHICH IS. WHERE THEY'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO LOOK AT THAT -- I PAGANI DANCER IN ANYWAY. I THINK ONE THING ON A THREE WEEKS AGO WHEN JEFF ADACHI WAS HERE HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE TREASURER OF THE COUNTY AND CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. WHO BASICALLY SAID THAT ON NGOR COLLECTING THE FEES BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD MADE IT NOT WORTH THAT? IN OTHER WORDS IT COSTS MORE TO TRY TO COLLECT. MONEY FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE IT. BAND THEY THEN DOING IT SO IT JUST YOU KNOW IT'S A LOSS BASICALLY IS WHAT HE SAID OR WASH. I'M NOT SURE OF THE EXACT NUMBERS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT THE CONCERN OVER THE VICTIMS RESTITUTION FUND IS A SERIOUS. ONE AT ITS DEPLETING VERY VERY QUICKLY AS A YOU MAY BE AWARE WE'RE BOTH ON SUB. FIVE SO HOPE THIS WILL TRIGGER OUR CONVERSATION AND OUR DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT FUND IS NOT GO -- RIPLEY BECAUSE OF BILLS LIKE THIS -- ONE THIS IS CLEARLY WORTHY OF MY SUPPORT AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FORWARD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] OKAY.

THIS LEGISLATION EXPANDS WHO CAN ASK FOR A GUN BONTA STRAINING ORDER FROM THE COURT TO TEMPORARILY TAKE A GUN AWAY. CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION FALLS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL AS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS WOULD EXPAND IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CO WORKERS EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO YOU GO TO SCHOOL WITH SO ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS PROFESSORS. AND THE REASON IS AS WE'VE SEEN FAR TOO MANY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AS WELL AS WORKPLACE SHOOTINGS. WE SAW ALSO IN THIS SITUATION IN VENTURA COUNTY WE HAD ACTUALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD HAVE TAKEN THE GUN AWAY INTERACTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THEN. DID NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH IT UNFORTUNATELY -- WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN HAD A VETO MESSAGE THAT HE THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD WORK THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT WE DON'T WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT? BUT THIS ALLOWS PEOPLE THE OPTION IF AFTER DISCUSSING THE ISSUE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT INTERESTED IN MOVING FORWARD. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO PETITION THE COURT PETITION A JUDGE IN AGAIN IT'S PETITIONING A JUDGE IT'S NOT. IT'S IT'S A VERY STANDARD PROCESS THAT PEOPLE USE ALSO FOR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS SO AGAIN. VERY HAPPY TO SEE MORE OR MORE PEOPLE UTILIZE THIS TOOL THE BEEN A COUPLE HUNDRED A GUN BONTA STRAINING ORDERS ISSUED IN THE STATE. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND AGAIN I THINK WE ALL FEEL -- AT NIGHT THAT THESE HAVE FIREARMS ALL WITNESSES TO SPEAK. AND WOULD APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. CALVIN QUICK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- SO. AS A STUDENT I'M A STUDENT MYSELF -- IN HIGH SCHOOL AND BLOOM MANY PEOPLE. MANY STUDENTS FELLOW STUDENTS OR CO WORKERS. ON THE WALL NO. SOMEONE WHO IS AT RISK SOMETIMES BETTER THAN THEIR FAMILY -- I I KNOW THERE IS STUDENTS AT MY SCHOOL WHO. ARE NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH THEIR FAMILY THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED -- YOU KNOW THIS IS IN A THERE IS AN ISSUE OF COMMUNICATION THERE SOMETIMES SO THESE PEOPLE. CO WORKERS EMPLOYERS TEACHERS SOMETIMES NO BETTER THAN A FAMILY WHEN A PERSON IS AT RISK WHEN THE PERSON IS SUICIDAL PERHAPS AND THEY'RE NOT COMMUNICATING WITH. THEIR FAMILY. ON THE MAJORITY OF MASS SHOOTINGS IN IN SCHOOLS ON BURKE PLACES. ON THEIR COUPLE EXAMPLES THAT I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THE PARKLAND SHOOTING OF COURSE IN THAT INSTANCE THE SHOOTER WAS WELL KNOWN TO TEACHERS. OBSESSION WITH FIREARMS AND THEN IN THE AURORA ILLINOIS A SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO -- IT'S AND I FIND IT ON THAT. DISCONCERTING THAT I CAN TAKE AN EXAMPLE THAT SO WE SENT. V. BACKGROUND CHECKS FAILED AND WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING UP TO THE SHOOTING BUT THE SHOOTER HAD PREVIOUS CRIMINAL. RECORD. AND YET LAW ENFORCEMENT DID NOT ACT. HE WAS FIRED JUST BEFORE BEFORE THE SHOOTING. THE EMPLOYER THAT HE HAD. BEEN MADE THREATS EMPLOYERS CO WORKERS KNEW THAT THERE WAS. HE WAS IRAQ TECH INDIVIDUAL AND SO ULTIMATELY -- WE THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN OUR GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LAWS AND SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR PRIVATE. THANK YOU YES. AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AS I MENTIONED IN TESTIMONY EARLIER TODAY 97% OF COMBINES RESTRAINING ORDERS ISSUED FAST FAR HAVE BEEN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. I ACTUALLY DO NOT EXPECT THAT TO CHANGE MUCH BY THE TIME A CONCERNED PERSON. IS READY TO TAKE THIS STEP TO GO TO COURT AND FILE A PETITION IT'S PROBABLY RAISE TO THE LEVEL OF EMERGENCY. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT -- SHOULD BE CAUGHT AND IS USUALLY CAUGHT. HOWEVER -- THERE TIMES AS WE SAW IN PARKLAND PERHAPS IN BORDERLINE BAR AND GRILL AND I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS EASY TO SECOND GUESS THESE THINGS ON HIND SIGHT. BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE TIMES WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY BE UNRESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERN. OR WHEN UP CONCERN PARTY MAY BE RELUCTANT CO TO GO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR LEGAL STATUS. FOR EXAMPLE UNDOCUMENTED PERSON IN THE STATE -- IN THOSE CASES I THINK IT IS OPTION TO PETITION THE COURT. THEMSELVES. I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT I CARE ABOUT TO PROCESS THE FACT THAT GUNS CAN BE TAKEN AWAY BEFORE HEARING -- THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT -- RGV ARE ALL LAW HAS MORE PROTECTIONS THEM BOTH OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER LAWS. AND MENTAL HEALTH OF FIRE PROHIBITIONS DUE TO MENTAL ILLNESS STRICTLY THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY LAW -- SO THERE ARE MORE PROTECTIONS AND I WOULD SAY THE SAME COMMENT THAT I MAY WHEN THIS BILL WAS FIRST PASSED IN THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME -- THE WORST THAT HAPPENS IS SOMEONE LOSES THEIR COME FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS. THE WORST THAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS AN ACTION WHEN THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN IS THAT SOMEONE'S LOST THEIR LIFE. YOU CAN ALWAYS GIVE A COME BACK YOU CAN GET A LIFE BACK. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU. OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON DANNY CANDOR BECAUSE OUR ON BEHALF OF THE GIPPER'S LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. MR TURN MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY MIKE FUERAN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- WE HAVE MORE SUPPORT FOR OPPOSITION OKAY [inaudible] UP. WE WERE HERE FIRST. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. IT'S SO BAD HE HAD CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY -- I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY PREPARED A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL BUT I KNOW HOW ARE BOARD MEMBERS FEEL ABOUT IT -- ONE MEMBER USED TO WORK FOR A COMPUTER PROGRAM WHERE PEOPLE COME IN AND REQUEST HEROES ALL THE TIME. HE STATED THAT HE FELT. THEY WERE THEY WERE SO EASY TO GET THAT IT WAS JUST ALMOST GUARANTEED DEAL THAT PEOPLE. CAN GET IT HERE -- GRANTED ON AFFIDAVIT ALONE AND SO WITH THE COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW THIS DOES STAY ON A PERSON'S RECORD OF WEALTHY AFTER WELL BEYOND THE FACT. SO I KNOW THAT -- THOSE ARE SOME CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY OUR BOARD AND SO WE ARE REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. YES EVERY MORNING -- LIZZY BEACON WITH A SILLY OF CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE ALSO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION -- YEAH I DO WANT TO COMMAND THE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AND THE SPIRIT WITH WHICH HE HE BRINGS THIS BILL CERTAINLY -- THESE TRAGEDIES THAT WE'VE SEEN ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE VERY SERIOUS AND WE NEED TO TO TAKE ACTION -- WE DO FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO DO THAT WITHOUT UNNECESSARILY COMPROMISING CIVIL LIBERTIES AND UNFORTUNATELY WE WE DO THINK THAT THIS BILL WOULD IT UNDERMINE PEOPLE'S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS -- WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO GUN CONTROL MEASURES THAT THAT PROTECT PEOPLE TO PROCESS RIGHTS AND AND AND CIVIL RIGHTS WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO EVEN REMOVING GUNS FROM PEOPLE WHO POSE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. PROVIDED THAT THERE IS THERE ARE NOT NON DISCRIMINATORY CRITERIA INVOLVED AND THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT REDUCTION FOR DUE PROCESS WE DID NOT OPPOSE THE CREATION OF THE G. VIEIRA SYSTEM MEAN IN CALIFORNIA -- THIS BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY SIX AS A RESTRAINING ORDERS AS WE'VE HEARD FROM -- ONE OF PROPONENTS THAT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE CLOSER TO THEIR CO WORKERS THAN THEY ARE TO THE FAMILY -- THAT IS YOUR SOME PEOPLE IT IS NOT TRUE OF OF ALL PEOPLE THEIR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CO WORKERS. AND UNDER THIS BILL ANY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE COULD SEEK AS A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER -- YES THERE IS A JUDGE INVOLVED WITH THIS PROCESS INVOLVES ONE SIDE ONE SIDE PETITIONS THE JUDGE THE JUDGE ONLY HERE'S ONE SIDE THEY DO NOT HEAR FROM THE OTHER PERSON -- I'M REFERRING TO THE EX PARTY -- RESTRAINING ORDERS AND THE OTHER PERSON NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT THERE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THIS IS TAKING PLACE THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY FIND OUT. IS THAT AN OFFICER SHOWS UP AT THEIR DOOR -- TO TO CONFISCATE WEAPONS -- THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF A CRIME THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF MAKING CRIMINAL THREATS THEY'VE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF OF COMMITTING VIOLENCE. AND THEY THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY POSSESS ANY FARMS BUT WHEN AN OFFICER COME TO THEIR DOOR EXPECTING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO MAY BE DANGEROUS AND SOMEONE HIGH UP TO THIS IS FIREARMS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THAT ENCOUNTER -- MIGHT HAPPEN AND WHETHER THAT MIGHT. SO OUR CONCERN IS. NECESSARILY WITH A PERSON. LOSING. THEIR THEIR FARMS FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE SEARCH THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE -- THAT WE FEEL LIKE. THAT WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT SUFFICIENT TO PROCESS. ARE I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT REGARDING THE SCHOOLS THIS WOULD ALLOW I'M AN EMPLOYEE AT A SCHOOL. WHO HAD BEEN THERE IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS WOULD ENCOUNTER THE STUDENT IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS? TO SEE CONNECTS PARTY COME BOUNCES RUNNING ORDER THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF A GUN FOR VIOLENCE RESTRAINING OF AN EX PARTE ORDER IS THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION. AND SO THE FACT THAT A PERSON MIGHT NOT HAVE AND ENCOUNTERED A STUDENT FOR SIX MONTHS SEEMS. TO NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE URGENCY OF THESE TYPES OF RESTRAINING ORDERS. OZ SO. OF FOR THESE REASONS WE DO THINK THAT THIS BILL WOULD HAVE A DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT -- YOU KNOW IN PART BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IRRATIONAL FEARS OF PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR RELIGION BASED ON THEIR ON THEIR RACE -- CERTAINLY CO WORKERS CAN HARBOR THOSE FEARS OF OTHER COWORKERS AND SO WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS IS SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT PEOPLE SEE PROCESS RIGHT SO FOR FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. DâN READ WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE FOR C. R. PA -- IN OPPOSITION -- AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM THE ACLU IS POINTED OUT THAT THE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS IN THE UNDERLYING CONCEPT HERE OR JUST INADEQUATE. WHO WERE TALK ABOUT SOMEONE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THESE ARE PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME ADJUDICATED MENTALLY ILL? AND WERE GETTING THIRD PARTY ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT ONLY LOOK AT THIS BILL IN THE THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF WHO CAN BE A REPORTER -- COLLEAGUES -- COWORKERS -- SCHOOL EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE SAME TOPIC THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA ENCOUNTER INCLUDING. EXTENDING GBR ROSE OUT TO FIVE YEARS -- I BELIEVE THERE'S A BILL THAT ELIMINATES NOTICE THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER. WHEN WE'RE GONNA SAY SOMEONE SO DANGEROUS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE RIGHTS WITHOUT A HEARING FOR SEVERAL WEEKS -- AND NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE WE'RE NOT OFFERING MANY MIDDLE HEALTH TREATMENT WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE TO CONTROL ANY OTHER DANGERS BEHAVIOR THAT WE CAN HAVE. WE'RE JUST FOCUSING ON ON FIREARMS RIGHT SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN -- WORK ON CRIME CONTROL WORK ON GETTING MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES OUT THERE NOT JUST. TAKING SOMEONE'S GUNS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS -- AND THESE ORDERS CAN BE EXTENDED RIGHT AND SO FOR LOOKING AT EXTENDING -- YOU COULD. CO GO YEARS WITHOUT HAVING A RIGHTS WITH NOT EVER GETTING A JUDICATA MENTALLY ILL OR BEING CONVICTED OF A CRIME -- MY COLLEAGUE HERE MENTIONED -- ABOUT THE INTERACTION POLICE WHEN I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS NOT A SINGLE OFFICER GOING OUT KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR AND SAYING -- CLOSER AND YOUR PHARMACIST WALK CALL. AND THIS COULD THIS IS NOT DE ESCALATION THIS IS ESCALATION A LOT OF SENSE WAS THAT SOMEONE'S GONNA BE ROLLING UP A I HAD A CONVERSATION LAST WEEK WITH THE SHERIFF HE SAID IT'S A AND EVERY TIME HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GO OUT ON THE SO. I THINK THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER WE STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL MAINLY ON THE DUE PROCESS AND THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION REPORTERS BUT I'M HAPPY TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION THANK YOU. UNDERSTAND PERCENT BRITISH REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA ONE ECHO THE CONCERNS OF OF THAT HAVE BEEN STATED HERE -- IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY TREAT PEOPLE THAT ARE ARRESTED FOR A CRIME BETTER THAN WE DO PEOPLE WHO SOMEONE THINKS THAT MAYBE. THEY ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS WHEN YOU ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO JAIL YOU'VE GOT TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE YOU HAVE TO GO. AND GET AN ARRAIGNMENT SO YOU HAVE YOUR DAY IN COURT. QUICKLY IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE TWENTY ONE DAYS WHERE YOU JUSTICE IS DELAYED AND AS MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID IN LETTERS FROM PRISON. JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS SITUATION -- ONE OF THE PROPONENTS A MENTION THAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT SOMEBODY'S GUNS ARE TAKEN AWAY -- FOR UNIT TWENTY ONE DAYS KNOW THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT SOMEBODY'S GUNS ARE TAKEN AWAY FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THEY NEEDED THEM. IN THEIR OWN HOMES OR THEIR OWN BUSINESSES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEY LOSE THEIR LIVES BECAUSE SOMEBODY FILED THIS ORDER AND THERE IS NO JUSTICE. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE. VERY CONCERNED WITH THIS IS POINTED OUT. IT ALMOST SEEMS TO WAS TO BE DISINGENUOUS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND A BRIDGE SOMEBODY'S RIGHTS. AND THEN YOU JUST TAKE GO OFF AND BE FREE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAPPENS NOTHING THAT'S REQUIRED TO CHECK TO SEE IF THEY REALLY ARE A DANGER. EXCEPT TWENTY ONE DAYS LATER YOU GO TO COURT AND THERE'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. BUT IN THAT CASE IF THEY REALLY ARE IN DANGER THEY'RE JUST TOLD GO OUT. AND AS WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO -- YOU KNOW CAN GET GUNS THROUGH ILLEGAL MEANS TO IF THEY'RE THAT HECK BENT ON ON COMMITTING SOME SORT OF THE VIEW. THAT'S WHY WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] FIVE IN ANY OTHER BEEN. MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- I THINK WE WOULD OPPOSE THIS BILL UNLESS AS AMENDED I WOULD SECOND THE CONCERNS THAT -- THIS BUCHANAN EXPRESSED ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A SEARCH BY ARMED POLICE OFFICERS AT SOMEONE'S HOME BASED ON THE EX PARTE ORDER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK. I'M. SO I HAVE THIS AS AS I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE SEMI MEMBER ACTING I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE. NOT QUITE THE SAME AS THE GUN OWNERS BUT WE HAVE BEEN TO BE ON THE SAME RARELY ARE WE EVER HAVE SAME SIDE BUT TODAY WE ARE -- I COULD ACCEPT SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE NARROW FOR EXAMPLE A TEACHER -- WOULD GO TO THE PRINCIPAL AND TO GET -- DETERMINE THAT THE STUDENT WAS AT RISK BUT JUST TO HAVE A RANDOM CO WORKERS SAY SOMEONE IS AT RISK IS JUST. TOO HOW CAN I SAY IT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY CAN BE SETTLING THE SCORE. THEY CAN BE LYING THROUGH THEIR TEETH. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE TO ME I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE DONE I COULD SUPPORT THE BILL IN A MORE NARROW WAY BUT NOT AS IT'S CURRENTLY -- PRESENTED. ANY OTHER QUOTE MISTER LACKEY. YEAH JUST. TO ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GIVE A STATISTIC THAT I FIND TO BE FAIRLY COMPELLING. ON THIS DISCUSSION THE FREQUENCY TO WHICH GUN. VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS WERE ISSUED FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN REQUESTED BY FAMILY MEMBERS WAS. EIGHTEEN REQUESTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS. FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX SO WE COULD SEE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS VERY VERY ACTIVE. AND I THINK THAT -- IN ALL HONESTY THIS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM AND THE ARE DUE PROCESS CONCERNS ARE VERY VERY. POWERFUL MY OPINION SO I I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I DID JUST TO CLARIFY THE STATS -- MY AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- LANCASTER'S CORRECT THERE'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OVER THE THREE YEARS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF GUN OWNERS IN FROM A SMALL NUMBER. WHILE CERTAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE PRIME MANY OF THOSE LARGE MAJORITY OF THOSE HAVE COME FROM SAN DIEGO. BECAUSE OF THE CITY ATTORNEY'S LEADERSHIP. I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FOR THE TO COUNTY THAT I REPRESENT SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN MATTEO. THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE ISSUED IN THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD. SO AGAIN FOR WHATEVER REASON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN MY TO COUNTIES. HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THIS AS OUR PRIORITY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING GIVEN THE WE HAVE PERSONALLY MET WITH -- WHAT WITH WITH ONE OF THE AGENCIES IN OUR IN OUR JURISDICTION AGAIN IT JUST ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LIVING IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS TO HAVE ANOTHER RECOURSE? ON SIX HUNDRED IN THREE YEARS IS NOT A VERY LARGE NUMBER I THINK WHEN WHEN I FIRST PRESENTED THIS BILL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CONCERN IS -- THIS IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A LINE BY THE COURT ROOM AND THEY'LL BE HANDING THEM OUT BY THE THOUSANDS OF THE MILLIONS AND REALLY. THAT HAS NOT REALLY HAPPENED I THINK EVEN WITH THIS -- EXPANSION. THIS EXPANSION WILL ONLY. MY IN MY OPINION SLIGHTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS BUT WHAT IT DOES IT GIVES PEOPLE A REASONABLE OPTION WHO CAN WHO ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR SITUATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY WITH MANY OF THE ALWAYS HERE OR WHAT THE SITUATION WAS AFTER THE FACT WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS LAST YEAR WE HEARD ABOUT THE PARKING SITUATION WITH THE FBI WAS. WATCHING THIS INDIVIDUAL THE PRINCIPLES WATCHING THIS INDIVIDUAL THE TEACHERS WERE WATCHING THIS INDIVIDUAL UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. UNDER FLORIDA LAW. UNDER OUR LOG FIFTY AYE FISHEL COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT -- WE SIGNED INTO A AGAIN YOU HAD. DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACT WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL AND NOTHING WAS DONE. SO AGAIN AND ALLOWS PEOPLE. RECOURSE ALLOWS PEOPLE TO TAKE. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ACTION IN THEIR OWN HANDS WHICH I BELIEVE IS HIS THEIR RIGHT TO PROTEST LABOR ONE HAS A RIGHT TO GO TO WORK AND NOT GET KILLED. PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND NOT GET KILLED AFTER THE PARKING SHOOTING I'M A FOURTH GRADER I HAD A FIFTH GRADER. IF YOU CAN IMAGINE AS A PARENT OF A FIFTH GRADER [inaudible] HAVE A TEACHER HAVE TO TALK. TO GO TO FIFTH GRADERS ABOUT WHAT TO DO. IN THE CASE OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. OKAY THIS IS NOT A PRISON. THIS IS NOT A JUVENILE HALL. THIS IS NOT [inaudible] IF A FACILITY THAT SHOULD BE ANYWHERE [inaudible] AT RISK. BUT THE FACT. THAT IT SEEMS EVERY WEEK GOES BY WE SEEM TO HAVE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. AND THAT'S OUR SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY [inaudible] AREN'T SAFE. WHAT IS A SAY ABOUT US AS A SOCIETY WITH THE SAME BALANCE AS A OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT IF WE HAVEN'T DO IF WE'RE NOT DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE? TO MAKE OUR SCHOOL CHILDREN SAFE. I DON'T THINK WE'RE DOING OUR JOB SO AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A MODEST MEASURE. TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION -- APPRECIATE THAT COMMITTEES SUPPORT IN THE PAST AND AND AGAIN BACK HERE THIS YEAR. TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE COMMITTEE TO AGAIN -- SUPPORT AB SIXTY ONE THANK YOU I'LL MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BELL [inaudible] A SECOND. OKAY. THANK YOU AND AND I KNOW THIS IS THIS IS -- OUT OF ECHO DOES THE SAME AS MR QUIRK BAD -- YOU'VE PROBABLY DONE SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN'T DO A WASHING DC IS GET THE ACLU IN IT AND ARE A ON THE SAME PAGE IN A AN HAVE MEETS COLLEGE OTHER COLLEAGUES IS A PRETTY REMARKABLE. FEAT IN ITSELF -- I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL AND HOPEFULLY YOU TAKE SOME OF THE COMMENTS GOT MR QUIRK ON THE OTHER SIDE. IF THE ECONOMIC COME UP WITH SOME COMPROMISE YOU MAY EVEN BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE ACLU. TO TRY TO GET SOME TYPE OF COMPROMISE BY I DON'T WANT TO DIE HERE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.
