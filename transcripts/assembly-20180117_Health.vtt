00:35:39.004 --> 00:35:41.673 region:rollup2
A FRAGMENTATION.

00:35:40.205 --> 00:35:43.341 region:rollup2
IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND

00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:44.476 region:rollup2
WHAT IT MEANS FOR PATIENTS AFTER

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:47.545 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS.

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:49.214 region:rollup2
TO GUARANTEE POPULATION HEALTH.

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:50.915 region:rollup2
AND EQUITY IN THE HEALTHCARE

00:35:49.214 --> 00:35:52.250 region:rollup2
SYSTEM YEAH I THINK IT'S FAIR TO

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:54.419 region:rollup2
SAY THAT NO ONE WOULD DESIGN OUR

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:56.221 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. OF FROM

00:35:54.419 --> 00:35:58.156 region:rollup2
SCRATCH AND END UP WITH THIS

00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:59.090 region:rollup2
CRAZY QUILT IF WE HAD TO DO IT

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:00.859 region:rollup2
ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.327 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE

00:36:00.859 --> 00:36:04.729 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTANDING ITS

00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:06.531 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS BOTH GOOD AND BAD.

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:09.501 region:rollup2
MAY HELP TO INFORM WHAT BETTER

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:11.903 region:rollup2
SYSTEM MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND HOW

00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:13.738 region:rollup2
BEST TO TRANSITION TO THAT.

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:14.572 region:rollup2
I'M TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:15.974 region:rollup2
BIRDS EYE VIEW OF.

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:17.409 region:rollup2
OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND

00:36:15.974 --> 00:36:18.309 region:rollup2
AND FRAGMENTATION IN IT.

00:36:17.409 --> 00:36:19.244 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.578 region:rollup2

JUST WAIT TO THE GENTLEMAN IS A.

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:47.365 region:rollup2

THANK YOU.

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:50.368 region:rollup2
ONCE OVER THE PICTURE OF OF

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:51.469 region:rollup2
HEALTH COVERAGE IN OUR CURRENT

00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:53.838 region:rollup2
SYSTEM I THINK THIS PICTURE IS

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:54.639 region:rollup2
QUITE FAMILIAR. TO MEMBERS OF

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:56.074 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE.

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:57.342 region:rollup2
THEIR VARIETY OF ESTIMATES OF

00:37:56.074 --> 00:37:58.743 region:rollup2
OF HEALTH COVERAGE IN IN

00:37:57.342 --> 00:38:00.645 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK THIS

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:02.046 region:rollup2
GIVES A GOOD PICTURE. OF THE

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:03.982 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY OF OF COVERAGE.

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:04.682 region:rollup2
AS YOU CAN SEE EMPLOYER BASED

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:06.851 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:08.253 region:rollup2
EVEN AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:09.954 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS STILL

00:38:08.253 --> 00:38:11.789 region:rollup2
THE MAIN SOURCE OF COVERAGE OF

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.590 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE IN

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.324 region:rollup2
IN EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.893 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:16.261 region:rollup2
AND IMPORTANTLY.

00:38:14.893 --> 00:38:17.862 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO BEING A.

00:38:16.261 --> 00:38:19.397 region:rollup2
A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.998 region:rollup2
COVERAGE AYE EMPLOYER BASED

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:21.833 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IS ALSO LARGELY OUT

00:38:19.998 --> 00:38:24.235 region:rollup2
OF.

00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:26.905 region:rollup2
THE CONTROL OF STATE REGULATION.

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:29.507 region:rollup2
LARGELY CONTROLLED TICKLING

00:38:26.905 --> 00:38:31.276 region:rollup2
SELF INSURED EMPLOYER PLANS

00:38:29.507 --> 00:38:32.844 region:rollup2
UNDER THE FEDERAL TO WRESTLE AW

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:34.112 region:rollup2
SO LEAST IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:36.347 region:rollup2
AND THE LARGEST SOURCE OF

00:38:34.112 --> 00:38:37.982 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IS LARGELY OUT OF OUT

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:39.417 region:rollup2
OF STATE CONTROL.

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:41.119 region:rollup2
ARM AS YOU KNOW MEDICAID.

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.853 region:rollup2
IS ALSO A LARGE SOURCE OF

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:44.422 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

00:38:41.853 --> 00:38:45.924 region:rollup2
GREW BIGGER GREW QUITE RAPIDLY

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:47.325 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING YEAH IMPLEMENTATION

00:38:45.924 --> 00:38:48.693 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:50.728 region:rollup2
WHICH CALIFORNIA WAS CERTAINLY A

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:52.197 region:rollup2
PROACTIVE IN.

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:53.932 region:rollup2
IN THEIR CAL I MEAN

00:38:52.197 --> 00:38:55.667 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL PROGRAM IS

00:38:53.932 --> 00:38:56.801 region:rollup2
IS LIKELY THE OUT ONE OF IF NOT

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.503 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST

00:38:56.801 --> 00:39:00.705 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC INSURANCE PROGRAM.

00:38:58.503 --> 00:39:02.640 region:rollup2
IN IN THE COUNTRY.

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:03.975 region:rollup2
MAYBE ONE MORE IMPORTANT THAN

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.810 region:rollup2
HOW PEOPLE ARE COVERED AT ANY

00:39:03.975 --> 00:39:07.545 region:rollup2
ONE TIME WHICH IS WHAT THIS THIS

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:10.081 region:rollup2
CHART SHOWS. IS THE ENORMOUS

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:12.183 region:rollup2
CHURN ACROSS SOURCES OF COVERAGE

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:14.652 region:rollup2
AS PEOPLE CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:15.920 region:rollup2
HOW PEOPLE CHANGE JOBS LOSE JOBS

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:17.288 region:rollup2
GAME JOBS.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.156 region:rollup2
INCREASE OUR INCOME DECREASED

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:19.858 region:rollup2
THEIR INCOME.

00:39:18.156 --> 00:39:21.326 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CHANGE VERY VERY

00:39:19.858 --> 00:39:23.061 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY FROM ONE SOURCE OF

00:39:21.326 --> 00:39:23.428 region:rollup2
INSURANCE TO ANOTHER AND IT'S

00:39:23.061 --> 00:39:25.630 region:rollup2
THOSE.

00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:27.365 region:rollup2
IT'S THOSE TRANSITIONS FROM ONE

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.799 region:rollup2
SOURCE INSURANCE TO ANOTHER

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:29.834 region:rollup2
THAT'S OFTEN CREATES

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:31.569 region:rollup2
DISRUPTIONS.

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:33.338 region:rollup2
IN THE SYSTEM AND YOU'LL HEAR

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:34.606 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE ABOUT THAT THAT CHURN

00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:36.808 region:rollup2
IN INSURANCE.

00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:38.543 region:rollup2
FROM JOHN GRAVES LATER.

00:39:36.808 --> 00:39:38.710 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:39:38.543 --> 00:39:40.678 region:rollup2
THE.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.946 region:rollup2
.

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:43.481 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THAT THE MAIN REASON

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:44.215 region:rollup2
FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT THE

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:45.650 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT THESE

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:47.752 region:rollup2
DISRUPTIONS ARE.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.386 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS PEOPLE TRANSITION

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.153 region:rollup2
FROM ONE TYPE OF INSURANCE TO

00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:51.456 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:52.523 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE EACH SECTOR OF OF

00:39:51.456 --> 00:39:53.892 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM HAS

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:55.293 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT RULES AND VERY

00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:57.328 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROCEDURES.

00:39:55.293 --> 00:39:58.830 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ELIGIBILITY.

00:39:57.328 --> 00:40:00.498 region:rollup2
IS VERY DIFFERENT ANYTIME

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.367 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TRANSITIONS FROM ONE

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:03.134 region:rollup2
SOURCE INSURANCE TO ANOTHER.

00:40:02.367 --> 00:40:05.370 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:05.970 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY PROCESS THAT PROCESS

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.805 region:rollup2
CAN CERTAINLY BE QUITE

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.507 region:rollup2
BURDENSOME OPTICALLY IN THE CASE

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:10.375 region:rollup2
OF MEDI CAL OR COVERED

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:12.477 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:14.412 region:rollup2
CARSHARING VARIES NOT ONLY

00:40:12.477 --> 00:40:15.813 region:rollup2

ALSO AMONG ENSURE INSURANCE

COMPANIES AND NOT JUST THE LEVEL

DEDUCTIBLES OR CO PAYS APPLY TO

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:31.429 region:rollup2
AND THAT CREATES COMPLICATIONS

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.896 region:rollup2
AND CONFUSION AFTER PATIENTS AS

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:33.798 region:rollup2

PROVIDERS.

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:36.301 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOTE THAT THEY COVER

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:38.436 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:39.904 region:rollup2

BIGGEST SOURCE OF COMPLICATION

PROVIDERS AS WELL.

00:40:56.154 --> 00:40:59.557 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEM IS STILL NOT GOOD AT

IDENTIFY WHICH DOCTORS ARE IN A

ACCESS CARE.

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:14.138 region:rollup2
THIS CAN LEAD TO SURPRISE

MEDICAL BILLS.

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:16.975 region:rollup2

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:31.983 region:rollup2
I THINK AS MEMBERS OF THE

00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:34.786 region:rollup2

00:42:31.983 --> 00:42:36.320 region:rollup2
PRICES PAID BY MEDICARE ALL ARE

HIGHER THAN PRICES IN.

OUR SOURCE OF CONFUSION AFTER

PATIENTS AS WELL AS PROVIDERS.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:17.028 region:rollup2
AND IN FINALLY GOVERNANCE.

00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:18.362 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO ONE WHO IS IN

00:43:17.028 --> 00:43:19.430 region:rollup2
CHARGE OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:21.432 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHO IS

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.633 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR. GUARANTEEING

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:24.202 region:rollup2
POPULATION HEALTH FOR

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:25.503 region:rollup2
CONTROLLING COSTS FOR INSURING

00:43:24.202 --> 00:43:27.171 region:rollup2
QUALITY.

00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:29.073 region:rollup2
FOR ENSURING EQUITY.

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:31.075 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE.

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:32.944 region:rollup2
HERE WE HAVE. MULTIPLE PUBLIC

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:33.678 region:rollup2
AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:43:32.944 --> 00:43:34.445 region:rollup2
REGULATING INSURANCE IN

00:43:33.678 --> 00:43:36.514 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:37.748 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT AGENCY RESPONSIBLE

00:43:36.514 --> 00:43:39.717 region:rollup2
FOR RUNNING MEDI CAL.

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:40.218 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ALSO PLAYING A MAJOR

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:41.719 region:rollup2
ROLE.

00:43:40.218 --> 00:43:43.020 region:rollup2
IN ADMINISTERING.

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:45.223 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:47.258 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE INSURERS.

00:43:45.223 --> 00:43:48.359 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN RANGE FROM NONPROFIT

00:43:47.258 --> 00:43:50.595 region:rollup2
TO FOR PROFIT.

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:53.331 region:rollup2
TO COMMUNITY BASED PLANS.

00:43:50.595 --> 00:43:55.099 region:rollup2
AND ALSO EMPLOYERS AS WELL AND

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:56.501 region:rollup2
SO WE VERY BALKANIZED APPROACH

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:58.069 region:rollup2
EPICALLY COMPARED TO OTHER

00:43:56.501 --> 00:44:01.472 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES IN OUR OVERSIGHT OF

00:43:58.069 --> 00:44:02.507 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH CARE SO.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.941 region:rollup2
I'M SETS A THINKING ABOUT THE

00:44:02.507 --> 00:44:05.042 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS.

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:06.144 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY ALMOST EVERY

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:07.345 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:09.213 region:rollup2
FRAGMENTATION.

00:44:07.345 --> 00:44:10.281 region:rollup2
HAS A FLIP SIDE AND I WOULD

00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:13.184 region:rollup2
HESITATE TO.

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:14.719 region:rollup2
CALL THESE CONSEQUENCES GOOD OR

00:44:13.184 --> 00:44:17.188 region:rollup2
BAD OR POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE.

00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:17.889 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT VERY MUCH DEPENDS.

00:44:17.188 --> 00:44:19.123 region:rollup2
ON YOUR VALUES.

00:44:17.889 --> 00:44:21.125 region:rollup2
AND.

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:23.160 region:rollup2
AND AND HOW YOU VIEW THEM.

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:24.595 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.464 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES SO

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:28.499 region:rollup2
SORE POINT TO FIRST ARE

00:44:26.464 --> 00:44:30.568 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY COSTS AND YOU KNOW

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:32.103 region:rollup2
WITH NO CENTRAL OVERSIGHT. OF

00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:33.938 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE SYSTEM.

00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:35.273 region:rollup2
IT'S OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:44:33.938 --> 00:44:36.173 region:rollup2
CONTROL THOSE COSTS

00:44:35.273 --> 00:44:37.742 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WE AND.

00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:38.309 region:rollup2
WE IN HEALTH POLICY OFTEN REFER

00:44:37.742 --> 00:44:39.343 region:rollup2
TO THIS AS THE WATER BALLOON

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:41.279 region:rollup2
EFFECT

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:42.513 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU PUSH ON ONE. PART OF

00:44:41.279 --> 00:44:44.382 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN ONE PART OF

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:46.150 region:rollup2
A WATER BALLOON AT THE COST TEND

00:44:44.382 --> 00:44:46.817 region:rollup2
TO SHOW UP IN SOME OTHER PART OF

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.786 region:rollup2
THE WATER BILL AND.

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:50.121 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT ANY ABILITY FOR

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:51.589 region:rollup2
CENTRAL OVERSIGHT IT'S VERY

00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:54.592 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE OVERALL

00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:56.527 region:rollup2
SIZE OF THE THE WATER BUILDING.

00:44:54.592 --> 00:44:57.195 region:rollup2
NOW THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:59.230 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:44:57.195 --> 00:45:01.165 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF LACK OF CONTROL

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.900 region:rollup2
ALSO IN SOME SENSE PROVIDES A

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:05.636 region:rollup2
SAFETY VALVE IF THE CONSTRAINTS

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:07.438 region:rollup2
ON COSTS ARE ARE TOO TIGHT.

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:09.273 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THE THE THE.

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:11.776 region:rollup2
AT THE HEALTH SYSTEM IT YOU

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:12.810 region:rollup2
KNOW IF IF THERE'S A. AYE A FLU

00:45:11.776 --> 00:45:14.178 region:rollup2
EPIDEMIC HAS IN FACT WHERE WE

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:15.746 region:rollup2
SEEM TO BE HAVING RIGHT NOW.

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:17.682 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:19.250 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S THAT

00:45:17.682 --> 00:45:21.085 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO EXPLICIT DECISION

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.986 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE TO RELAX

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:24.021 region:rollup2
THAT THE COST CONSTRAINTS.

00:45:21.986 --> 00:45:25.489 region:rollup2
.

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:27.825 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CUT CONSEQUENCE WHICH I

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:29.727 region:rollup2
ALLUDED TO IS IS DISRUPTION OF

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:31.262 region:rollup2
CARE GIVEN THE CHURN. IN THE

00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:32.830 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM THE

00:45:31.262 --> 00:45:34.165 region:rollup2
RAPID TRANSITIONS FROM ONE TYPE

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.766 region:rollup2
OF INSURANCE.

00:45:34.165 --> 00:45:37.101 region:rollup2
TO ANOTHER SHE PLANS WITH

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:39.003 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT NETWORKS DIFFERENT

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:40.838 region:rollup2
DRUG FORMULARIES A ANY CHANGE IN

00:45:39.003 --> 00:45:42.940 region:rollup2
PLAN CAN REQUIRE CHANGING DOCTOR

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:44.642 region:rollup2
CHANGING HOSPITAL WHERE CHANGE

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.477 region:rollup2
IN IN MEDICATION AND LEAD TO

00:45:44.642 --> 00:45:47.545 region:rollup2
SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS.

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:49.547 region:rollup2
THIS AWESOME RAISES

00:45:47.545 --> 00:45:50.815 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN IN IN

00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:52.783 region:rollup2
MANAGING THE SYSTEM BOTH FOR

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:54.952 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:55.720 region:rollup2
AND FOR INSURERS.

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.220 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THE FLIP SIDE OF

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.422 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT IT CREATES

00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:01.492 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION.

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:03.160 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I DON'T TO MAKE TO.

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:04.962 region:rollup2
TOO STRONG A CASE FOR THIS.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.330 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FRANKLY MUCH OF THE

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:07.832 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AND PAYMENT REFORM.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.699 region:rollup2
HAS COME FROM MEDICARE.

00:46:07.832 --> 00:46:10.868 region:rollup2
AND.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:11.769 region:rollup2
AND SPREAD TO TO THE PRIVATE

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:13.037 region:rollup2
SECTOR.

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.471 region:rollup2
UNIT BUT CERTAINLY ANYTIME YOU

00:46:13.037 --> 00:46:15.539 region:rollup2
HAVE MULTIPLE PAYERS

00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:17.141 region:rollup2
MULTIPLESECTORS.

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:18.142 region:rollup2
THERE'S GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:20.578 region:rollup2
INNOVATE AND.

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:22.980 region:rollup2
IN BOTH QUALITY AND AND COSTS.

00:46:20.578 --> 00:46:24.915 region:rollup2
.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.150 region:rollup2
AND GET UP A SINGLE PUBLIC PLAN

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.885 region:rollup2
PUTTING ALL YOUR EGGS IN THAT

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.953 region:rollup2
SINGLE BASKET A POTENTIALLY

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:31.322 region:rollup2
LEADS TO.

00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:33.724 region:rollup2
STAGNATION IN IN THE SYSTEM.

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:35.326 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:36.861 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY ALSO IN A AND AGAIN

00:46:35.326 --> 00:46:38.029 region:rollup2
I LIEU TO TO THIS.

00:46:36.861 --> 00:46:40.097 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:41.632 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF OF ANY CLEAR

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:42.166 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE HEALTH

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:44.602 region:rollup2
CARE SYSTEM.

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:46.570 region:rollup2
IN ONE AGENCY OR ONE BODY WITH

00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:48.239 region:rollup2
THAT DISPERSED CONTROL NO ONE IS

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:50.675 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ENSURING QUALITY

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:51.809 region:rollup2
COST CONTROL OR AFFORDABILITY.

00:46:50.675 --> 00:46:54.312 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY NOT THE HEALTH OF

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:56.314 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION AS AS A WHOLE.

00:46:54.312 --> 00:46:56.881 region:rollup2
NATIONAL EFFORTS YOU'RE A YEARS

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:58.683 region:rollup2
AGO.

00:46:56.881 --> 00:46:59.950 region:rollup2
TRIED TO CREATE LOCAL HEALTH

00:46:58.683 --> 00:47:01.585 region:rollup2
PLANNING AGENCIES.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:04.455 region:rollup2
TO TO FOCUS SOME OF THAT

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:05.356 region:rollup2
CONTROL IN A IN A SINGLE.

00:47:04.455 --> 00:47:06.757 region:rollup2
IN A SINGLE.

00:47:05.356 --> 00:47:08.959 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:10.761 region:rollup2
IN THOSE FRANKLY LARGELY FAILED.

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:11.762 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ALSO DID NOT

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:12.930 region:rollup2
CONTROL THE MONEY.

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:14.865 region:rollup2
AND I THINK OUR EXPERIENCE IN

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.268 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE IS THAT ANY ABILITY

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:18.402 region:rollup2
ANY EFFORT TO TRY TO. TO HOLD

00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:19.704 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:20.971 region:rollup2
WITHOUT CONTROL OVER THE FLOW OF

00:47:19.704 --> 00:47:24.208 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:25.676 region:rollup2
IS LIKELY TO FAIL.

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:28.345 region:rollup2
I'M IN I WOULD SAY* FRANKLY.

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:28.879 region:rollup2
THIS FRAGMENTATION LEADS TO

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.880 region:rollup2
TEARING IN THE HEALTHCARE

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:32.149 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.784 region:rollup2
WHERE WHAT YOU?

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:35.386 region:rollup2
WHAT COVERAGE YOU GET WHAT

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:36.487 region:rollup2
ACCESS YOU HAVE HOW AFFORDABLE

00:47:35.386 --> 00:47:38.089 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IS?

00:47:36.487 --> 00:47:40.024 region:rollup2
DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON.

00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:41.425 region:rollup2
ON YOUR INCOME AND YOU AND YOUR

00:47:40.024 --> 00:47:44.095 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:45.296 region:rollup2
THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK IN THE

00:47:44.095 --> 00:47:47.231 region:rollup2
DIRECTION YOU MIGHT THINK FOR

00:47:45.296 --> 00:47:48.766 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE IN

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:50.234 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL ARE COVERED CALIFORNIA

00:47:48.766 --> 00:47:51.202 region:rollup2
WITH ACCESS TO COST SHARING

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:52.870 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES.

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:54.038 region:rollup2
GET COVERAGE WITH MORE

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.440 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS AND LOWER

00:47:54.038 --> 00:47:57.842 region:rollup2
COST SHARING THEN MOST PEOPLE IN

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.510 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER BASED PLANS.

00:47:57.842 --> 00:48:01.712 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THE NETWORKS

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:03.914 region:rollup2
OF PROVIDERS IN THOSE PLANTS IS

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:04.381 region:rollup2
OFTEN NARROWER AND ACCESS AT

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:06.450 region:rollup2
TIMES CAN BE MORE MORE

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:08.586 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.120 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE FLIPSIDE IN AGAIN

00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:10.154 region:rollup2
THIS THIS DEPENDS ON YOUR

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.923 region:rollup2
VALUES.

00:48:10.154 --> 00:48:14.992 region:rollup2
TEARING PERMITS.

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:16.460 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS TO PAY LESS.

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:18.462 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A SINGLE SYSTEM WOULD

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.164 region:rollup2
ALMOST CERTAINLY REQUIRE HIGHER

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:21.098 region:rollup2
PRICES HIGHER PAYMENTS ON THE

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:23.701 region:rollup2
PART OF MEDI CAL.

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:25.603 region:rollup2
TO PHYSICIANS AND AND HOSPITALS.

00:48:23.701 --> 00:48:27.138 region:rollup2
.

00:48:25.603 --> 00:48:29.240 region:rollup2
AND IT PROVIDES AUTONOMY.

00:48:27.138 --> 00:48:30.975 region:rollup2
FOR CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYERS.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.510 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ANY TIERED SYSTEM

00:48:30.975 --> 00:48:33.210 region:rollup2
ALLOWS AN ESCAPE FROM THAT

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.579 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:38.582 region:rollup2
AND ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO CAN

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:39.950 region:rollup2
AFFORD MORE TO TO BUY MORE.

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:40.351 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER THAT'S.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.119 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S.

00:48:40.351 --> 00:48:43.220 region:rollup2
AND APPEALING.

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:45.289 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTIC OR NOT AGAIN

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.324 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON YOUR VALUES.

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:48.826 region:rollup2
.

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:49.760 region:rollup2
LOOKING INTERNATIONALLY AND AND

00:48:48.826 --> 00:48:50.594 region:rollup2
I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.629 region:rollup2
THE LAST HEARING.

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.897 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT CLEARLY

00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:54.498 region:rollup2
DISTINGUISHES THE U. S. FROM

00:48:52.897 --> 00:48:56.033 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTRIES IS THAT ALL

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:57.168 region:rollup2
OTHER COMPARABLE HIGH INCOME

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:58.736 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES PROVIDE ESSENTIAL

00:48:57.168 --> 00:48:59.870 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:01.038 region:rollup2
AND I WITH IT WITH AT LEAST

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.673 region:rollup2
NINETY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:03.841 region:rollup2
OF THE POPULATION COVERED.

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:06.343 region:rollup2
WE IN THE UNITED STATES IN

00:49:03.841 --> 00:49:07.845 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CLEARLY DO NOT.

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:09.880 region:rollup2
WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:11.215 region:rollup2
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT A

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.483 region:rollup2
CUTTING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED.

00:49:11.215 --> 00:49:13.684 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY OF THE MORE

00:49:12.483 --> 00:49:16.120 region:rollup2
RECENTLY THE NUMBER VENTURED

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:16.754 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO BE RISING AGAIN.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.688 region:rollup2
WITH THE CHANGE IN

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:19.657 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:20.257 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE STILL FAR SHORT OF

00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:21.559 region:rollup2
COVERING.

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:23.627 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE POPULATION.

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:25.629 region:rollup2
.

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:26.931 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD.

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.865 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHILE ALL OF THESE

00:49:26.931 --> 00:49:29.767 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTRIES PROVIDE

00:49:27.865 --> 00:49:31.902 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE A SINGLE

00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:33.470 region:rollup2
PAYER IS NOT THE NORM IN IN MOST

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.871 region:rollup2
HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES AROUND THE

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:36.307 region:rollup2
WORLD.

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:37.675 region:rollup2
APPEAR SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WITH

00:49:36.307 --> 00:49:39.243 region:rollup2
MINIMAL PATIENT COST SHARING.

00:49:37.675 --> 00:49:40.711 region:rollup2
IS SIMPLY NOT THE WAY THAT MOST

00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:42.279 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ACHIEVED

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:44.381 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:45.349 region:rollup2
THEIR COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:47.351 region:rollup2
AND SWITZERLAND THAT RETAIN A

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:48.419 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL ROLE FOR PRIVATE

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:49.653 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE.

00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:51.455 region:rollup2
THAT'S I WOULD NOTE THAT THAT

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:53.557 region:rollup2
IN ALL THOSE CASES THOSE

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:54.658 region:rollup2
INSURERS ARE NONPROFIT AND NOT

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.960 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT.

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:57.294 region:rollup2
AS MOST INSURERS ARE IN THE

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.929 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES.

00:49:57.294 --> 00:50:00.197 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO SIGNIFICANT COST

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:01.665 region:rollup2
SHARING IN A NUMBER OF THESE

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:03.434 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES INCLUDING FRANCE

00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:05.169 region:rollup2
GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND.

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:06.370 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME CASES PEOPLE CAN

00:50:05.169 --> 00:50:07.638 region:rollup2
BUY SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE TO

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:09.006 region:rollup2
FEELING THAT COST SHARING MUCH

00:50:07.638 --> 00:50:09.907 region:rollup2
LIKE THEY DO IN MEDICARE.

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:12.209 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:50:09.907 --> 00:50:13.043 region:rollup2
AND WHILE ALL OF THESE OTHER

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:13.944 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES HAVE UNIVERSAL

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:15.246 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:17.214 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE

00:50:15.246 --> 00:50:18.249 region:rollup2
GETS EXACTLY THE SAME THING A

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:19.850 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF COUNTRIES CREATE

00:50:18.249 --> 00:50:22.119 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:23.654 region:rollup2
MEANS TO PAY MORE TO GET MORE.

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:24.688 region:rollup2
BUT THE BASIC LEVEL OF COVERAGE

00:50:23.654 --> 00:50:26.490 region:rollup2
IN THESE COUNTRIES IS CERTAINLY

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:28.626 region:rollup2
A MUCH HIGHER BAR THAN WE HAVE

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:30.160 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE U. S..

00:50:28.626 --> 00:50:32.062 region:rollup2
TOM AND I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.796 region:rollup2
WHILE SINGLE PAYER IS NOT THE

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:34.231 region:rollup2
NORM.

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:35.1000 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONALLY.

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:37.234 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTRY CERTAINLY CARVE

00:50:35.1000 --> 00:50:38.936 region:rollup2
OUT A MUCH GREATER ROLE FOR

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:39.670 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT OF THE

00:50:38.936 --> 00:50:44.141 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:45.943 region:rollup2
THAN WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:46.844 region:rollup2
SOME NOW CERTAINLY A SINGLE

00:50:45.943 --> 00:50:47.845 region:rollup2
PAYER.

00:50:46.844 --> 00:50:49.146 region:rollup2
WOULD.

00:50:47.845 --> 00:50:51.982 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY.

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:52.683 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE FRAGMENTATION IN THE

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:55.185 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

00:50:52.683 --> 00:50:57.755 region:rollup2
BY ITS NATURE A SINGLE PAYER A

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:59.390 region:rollup2
PLAN ELIMINATES.

00:50:57.755 --> 00:51:00.991 region:rollup2
THE DISRUPTION.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:01.492 region:rollup2
FROM SWITCHING FROM ONE TYPE OF

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:03.427 region:rollup2
INSURANCE OR ONE PLAN TO

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:05.229 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:06.530 region:rollup2
IT PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:08.432 region:rollup2
CONTROLLING COSTS.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.633 region:rollup2
AND FOCUSES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.000 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN ONE

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:12.303 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.370 region:rollup2
.

00:51:12.303 --> 00:51:14.638 region:rollup2
GETTING TO THAT POINT AT WHICH I

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.372 region:rollup2
THINK I TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:18.175 region:rollup2
A HEARING.

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:20.477 region:rollup2
WOULD CERTAINLY BE A DISRUPTIVE.

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:21.946 region:rollup2
AND I THINK A SINGLE PAYER PLAN.

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:23.113 region:rollup2
RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

00:51:21.946 --> 00:51:24.415 region:rollup2
ABOUT GOVERNANCE IF YOU'RE GONNA

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:26.016 region:rollup2
FOCUS THAT LEVEL OF

00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:27.284 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AND CONTROL. IN

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:28.519 region:rollup2
ONE PLACE.

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:29.486 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S

00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:32.022 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE OF THAT GOVERNMENT

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:34.291 region:rollup2
AGENCY QUASI GOVERNMENT AGENCY?

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:36.026 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHO WHO ADVISES WHO

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:36.827 region:rollup2
CONCLUDED THAT AGENCY CONSULT

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.895 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:39.630 region:rollup2
AND.

00:51:37.895 --> 00:51:41.765 region:rollup2
HOW IS IT ADMINISTERED?

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.800 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY BY INSTAPUNDIT

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:45.736 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WHETHER BUY INTO

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.570 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ALIBI INTO MEDICARE AT

00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:48.706 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY WOULD HELP.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.707 region:rollup2
REDUCE FRAGMENTATION OF THE

00:51:48.706 --> 00:51:51.408 region:rollup2
OTHER OF COURSE NOT TO THE

00:51:49.707 --> 00:51:53.811 region:rollup2
EXTENT OF A SINGLE A GOVERNMENT

00:51:51.408 --> 00:51:54.945 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:51:53.811 --> 00:51:57.214 region:rollup2
TOM. AND I WOULD SAY A LOT OF

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:58.349 region:rollup2
THE CONSEQUENCES CONSEQUENCES OF

00:51:57.214 --> 00:52:00.951 region:rollup2
FRAGMENTATION TEND TO REVOLVE

00:51:58.349 --> 00:52:02.419 region:rollup2
AROUND DIFFERENCES IN PRICES.

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:04.822 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDER NETWORKS.

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:05.289 region:rollup2
IN THAT TYPE OF FRAGMENTATION

00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:07.324 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:08.425 region:rollup2
DISRUPTION FOR PATIENTS AND

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:10.194 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS THAT COULD BE

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:11.895 region:rollup2
MITIGATED THROUGH.

00:52:10.194 --> 00:52:13.097 region:rollup2
AND ALL PAY RATE SETTING SYSTEM

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:14.398 region:rollup2
FOREXAMPLE.

00:52:13.097 --> 00:52:15.866 region:rollup2
WHERE ALL PLANS?

00:52:14.398 --> 00:52:17.601 region:rollup2
PAYS THE SAME.

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:19.837 region:rollup2
THE SAME RIGHTS THE SAME RATES.

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:21.538 region:rollup2
TO THE SAME PROVIDERS.

00:52:19.837 --> 00:52:23.807 region:rollup2
OR EVEN THROUGH A MORE UNIFORM

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:25.542 region:rollup2
PRICING SYSTEM WHERE ALL PLANS

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:26.176 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDERS WERE REQUIRED TO.

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:28.245 region:rollup2
OPERATE.

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:29.947 region:rollup2
A SIMILAR PRICING STRUCTURE

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:32.683 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THE PRICE LEVELS.

00:52:29.947 --> 00:52:33.817 region:rollup2
WERE NOT THE SAME SO SHORT OF A

00:52:32.683 --> 00:52:35.219 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER PLAN AT LEAST

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:35.886 region:rollup2
REGULATING THE PRICING.

00:52:35.219 --> 00:52:37.354 region:rollup2
COULD.

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:38.822 region:rollup2
COULD COULD REDUCE SOME OF THE

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:40.424 region:rollup2
DISRUPTION.

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:42.059 region:rollup2
FOR FOR PATIENTS.

00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:43.994 region:rollup2
WITH A SIMILARLY GREATER

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:44.461 region:rollup2
UNIFORMITY IN BENEFITS ANDCOST

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:46.864 region:rollup2
SHARING.

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:47.898 region:rollup2
AS COVER CALIFORNIA HAS DONE.

00:52:46.864 --> 00:52:50.567 region:rollup2
WOULD ALSO.

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:52.503 region:rollup2
BIG THE SYSTEM MUCH SIMPLER.

00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:53.837 region:rollup2
AND REDUCE AGAIN SOME OF THAT

00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:55.939 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD AND SOME

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:57.408 region:rollup2
OF THAT COMPLICATION.

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:59.410 region:rollup2
I AM. AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY

00:52:57.408 --> 00:53:00.844 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WHILE OUR OUR MEDICAL

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:02.680 region:rollup2
CARE SYSTEM IS IN MANY WAYS THAT

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:03.847 region:rollup2
A TECHNOLOGICAL MARVEL.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.282 region:rollup2
OUR ADMINISTRATION OF THE

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:07.584 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS IN MANY

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:09.053 region:rollup2
WAYS INCREDIBLY BACKWARDS.

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:11.755 region:rollup2
TECH TECHNOLOGICALLY.

00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:13.424 region:rollup2
AS THAT VOX NEWS REPORTED TO

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:15.259 region:rollup2
ADD JUST RECENTLY THE FAX

00:53:13.424 --> 00:53:16.760 region:rollup2
MACHINE IS STILL. A IS STILL

00:53:15.259 --> 00:53:18.162 region:rollup2
QUEEN IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.563 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD TO FIND IN

00:53:18.162 --> 00:53:20.364 region:rollup2
IN THE REST OF THE OF THE

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.732 region:rollup2
ECONOMY.

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:23.500 region:rollup2
IT WE COULD REDUCE SOME OF THAT

00:53:21.732 --> 00:53:24.668 region:rollup2
SOME OF THIS COMPLICATION.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.103 region:rollup2
IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:28.706 region:rollup2
PATIENTS BUT CERTAINLY BY NO

00:53:26.103 --> 00:53:30.274 region:rollup2
MEANS ARE OLDER MOST.

00:53:28.706 --> 00:53:31.308 region:rollup2
THROUGH GREATER TRANSPARENCY.

00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:33.510 region:rollup2
I'M GREATER.

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:35.913 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF DATA.

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.680 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME WAYS UNLEASHING THE.

00:53:35.913 --> 00:53:38.882 region:rollup2
THE.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.417 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:41.919 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.886 region:rollup2
SILICON VALLEY AND AND DOWN

00:53:41.919 --> 00:53:44.521 region:rollup2
SOUTH.

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:46.957 region:rollup2
AND DEVELOPING TOOLS.

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:47.491 region:rollup2
AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WOULD.

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:51.795 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HELP SIMPLIFY

00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:52.396 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:52.529 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT.

00:53:52.396 --> 00:53:54.832 region:rollup2
.

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:56.033 region:rollup2
PENALTIES.

00:53:54.832 --> 00:53:57.000 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PERSONAL

00:53:56.033 --> 00:53:58.335 region:rollup2

OVERVIEW REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:02.806 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FOR MISTER LEVITT.

THANK YOU FOR YOU'RE A

00:54:03.674 --> 00:54:07.478 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION I THINK A CERTAINLY

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:08.879 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF WHY WE

00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:10.013 region:rollup2
HAVE THE FRAGMENTATION IN THE

00:54:08.879 --> 00:54:11.749 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WE DO IS.

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:13.117 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SPOT ON FROM WHAT I

00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:14.818 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK YOU'VE

00:54:13.117 --> 00:54:17.788 region:rollup2
LAID OUT OF SOME OF THE CHOICES

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:19.156 region:rollup2
WE HAVE. ARM IF YOU WERE HEALTH

00:54:17.788 --> 00:54:20.157 region:rollup2
CARE'S R. CALIFORNIA.

00:54:19.156 --> 00:54:22.760 region:rollup2
AMONG THESE DIFFERENT.

00:54:20.157 --> 00:54:25.763 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE WHAT

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.997 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU WOULD YOU UP FOR.

00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:29.700 region:rollup2
CAN I TURN DOWN THAT HEALTHCARE

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:30.701 region:rollup2
IS OUR JOB.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:34.771 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TURN A DOWN BUT WE'D

00:54:30.701 --> 00:54:35.272 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU TO ADVISE HIM.

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.040 region:rollup2
I.

00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:38.142 region:rollup2
AS AN ORGANIZATION THE KAISER

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.177 region:rollup2
FAMILY FOUNDATION DOESN'T

00:54:38.142 --> 00:54:42.112 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ADVOCATE ANY PARTICULAR.

00:54:40.177 --> 00:54:43.647 region:rollup2
SO WE WILL STIPULATE YOU'RE NOT

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:46.083 region:rollup2
SPEAKING FOR OUR KAISER BUT ARE

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:48.418 region:rollup2
SPEAKING AS A. INDIVIDUAL WHO

00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:49.620 region:rollup2
HAS A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THIS.

00:54:48.418 --> 00:54:51.021 region:rollup2
I MEAN I WOULD TAKE AND IT YOU

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.822 region:rollup2
KNOW AND NO ONE WOULD DESIGN OUR

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:54.458 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM.

00:54:51.822 --> 00:54:57.661 region:rollup2
IF GIVEN THE ABILITY TO TO TO

00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:59.496 region:rollup2
DO SO FROM THAT FROM SCRATCH AND

00:54:57.661 --> 00:55:01.965 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY.

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:05.469 region:rollup2
AT GREATER TRANSPARENCY.

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:08.772 region:rollup2
GREATER UNIFORMITY AND PRICES.

00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:10.274 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS STEP IN.

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:13.377 region:rollup2
BOTH CONTROLLING COSTS.

00:55:10.274 --> 00:55:14.678 region:rollup2
IN SIMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM.

00:55:13.377 --> 00:55:17.147 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WELL THAT WOULD

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:17.581 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY BE A A HEAVY LEFT OF

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:19.483 region:rollup2
BOTH TECHNICALLY AND

00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:20.784 region:rollup2
POLITICALLY.

00:55:19.483 --> 00:55:22.519 region:rollup2
IT WOULD.

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:22.986 region:rollup2
IT WOULD IT WOULD MAKE AN

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:24.421 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE.

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:27.958 region:rollup2
AND.

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:30.327 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I THINK WOULD BE A.

00:55:27.958 --> 00:55:31.228 region:rollup2
TO IT TAKING THAT STEP YOU KNOW

00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:33.330 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU SUPPORT.

00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:34.498 region:rollup2
A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM ARE NOT

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:36.767 region:rollup2
TAKING THAT STEP.

00:55:34.498 --> 00:55:38.202 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

00:55:36.767 --> 00:55:39.203 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW WOULD BE AT A

00:55:38.202 --> 00:55:43.540 region:rollup2
MINIMUM THE TRANSITION.

00:55:39.203 --> 00:55:46.210 region:rollup2
TO A A A A LESS EXPENSIVE.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:48.512 region:rollup2
FAIRER SIMPLER AND SIMPLER

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:50.080 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE'S.

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:50.714 region:rollup2
SO INTERNET A CONTRIVED.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.082 region:rollup2
YEAH I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:53.050 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING YOU YOU'D BE OPEN

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:54.284 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY TO THE IDEA OF

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:56.954 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER.

00:55:54.284 --> 00:56:00.891 region:rollup2
.

00:55:56.954 --> 00:56:03.393 region:rollup2
I I I I I'M.

00:56:00.891 --> 00:56:04.494 region:rollup2
.

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:05.295 region:rollup2
I THINK AND I AND I THINK I SAID

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:06.730 region:rollup2
THIS AT THE LAST HEARING AND

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:08.966 region:rollup2
IT'S IT SINGLE PAYER AYE I THINK

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.133 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER IS THE ONLY WAY.

00:56:08.966 --> 00:56:11.468 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY TO GET

00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:12.636 region:rollup2
TEETH TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:14.304 region:rollup2
SO.

00:56:12.636 --> 00:56:15.606 region:rollup2
.

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:17.207 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IF THAT IS THE GOAL

00:56:15.606 --> 00:56:18.709 region:rollup2
THEN I THINK A A SINGLE PAYER

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:19.610 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR

00:56:18.709 --> 00:56:21.612 region:rollup2
TO IT.

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:23.814 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT AND

00:56:21.612 --> 00:56:25.249 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY REALLY.

00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:26.683 region:rollup2
THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL. THINK THE

00:56:25.249 --> 00:56:28.619 region:rollup2
KEY TO THAT IS.

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:30.621 region:rollup2
ITS TAX BASE FINANCING.

00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:31.688 region:rollup2
WHERE EVERYONE IS AUTOMATICALLY

00:56:30.621 --> 00:56:33.423 region:rollup2
COVERED?

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:34.024 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S NOT A VOLUNTARY

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.292 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO SIGN

00:56:34.024 --> 00:56:37.894 region:rollup2
UP?

00:56:35.292 --> 00:56:38.428 region:rollup2
OHIO OR OR PAY PREMIUMS YOU KNOW

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:40.264 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S AN

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:41.698 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:43.300 region:rollup2
OR NOT.

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:44.701 region:rollup2
AND.

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:47.104 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT AT A

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:47.871 region:rollup2
SINGLE. PAYER SYSTEM OF OF SOME

00:56:47.104 --> 00:56:50.173 region:rollup2
SORT.

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:52.042 region:rollup2
OR EVEN A SYSTEM OF.

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:53.744 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NONPROFIT INSURERS

00:56:52.042 --> 00:56:55.912 region:rollup2
TODAY NEGOTIATE.

00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:57.481 region:rollup2
PRICES.

00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:58.348 region:rollup2
WITH PROVIDERS SIMILAR TO

00:56:57.481 --> 00:56:59.182 region:rollup2
GERMANY.

00:56:58.348 --> 00:57:02.486 region:rollup2
IS.

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:03.120 region:rollup2
IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO I

00:57:02.486 --> 00:57:04.988 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.256 region:rollup2
COSTS AND

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:07.291 region:rollup2
TROUT COSTS OVERALL. I I

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:09.493 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER CERTAINLY

00:57:07.291 --> 00:57:11.261 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO ALSO SUPPORTS THE

00:57:09.493 --> 00:57:12.562 region:rollup2
VISION OF OF SINGLE PAYER. ON

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:14.097 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHAT I HURT MY NEXT

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:14.631 region:rollup2
QUESTION WAS GONNA BE IF THERE

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:15.666 region:rollup2
IS A VARIATION OF A SINGLE

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:17.401 region:rollup2
PAYER.

00:57:15.666 --> 00:57:19.469 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT

00:57:17.401 --> 00:57:21.171 region:rollup2
YOU WERE MORE OPEN TO IT SOUNDS

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.772 region:rollup2
LIKE GERMANY.

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:24.508 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK YOU HAVE IT AGAIN

00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:26.310 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:57:24.508 --> 00:57:27.477 region:rollup2
THAT THEY THEY HAVE ALL GOT

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:29.613 region:rollup2
OTHER HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:31.782 region:rollup2
ALL ACHIEVED UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:33.350 region:rollup2
BUT HAVE DONE SO IN IN VERY

00:57:31.782 --> 00:57:34.618 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS AND THROUGH A

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:36.653 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT RATES.

00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:38.488 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHICH RANGE FROM.

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:40.857 region:rollup2
AFT A FULLY.

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:42.559 region:rollup2
A NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:44.194 region:rollup2
LIKE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:45.395 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM LIKE IN

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:47.631 region:rollup2
CANADA TO.

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:49.366 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE NONPROFIT INSURERS

00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:50.968 region:rollup2
LIKE IN GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND.

00:57:49.366 --> 00:57:53.136 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON IS

00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:55.472 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IS GUARANTEED? COVERAGE

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:56.940 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS SOME OF MUCH LARGER

00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:59.276 region:rollup2
ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT AND.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.977 region:rollup2
IN NEGOTIATING R. SETTING

00:57:59.276 --> 00:58:00.911 region:rollup2
PRICES.

00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:03.914 region:rollup2
AND THEN IN THE FINAL QUESTION

00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:05.816 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE POLITICAL REALITIES OF

00:58:03.914 --> 00:58:07.551 region:rollup2
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHAT

00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:09.853 region:rollup2
ADVICE COUNSEL WOULD YOU HAVE

00:58:07.551 --> 00:58:11.588 region:rollup2
FOR US OR FOR A HYPOTHETICAL

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:13.390 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE IS OUR CALIFORNIA.

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:14.958 region:rollup2
TO DESIGN A SYSTEM WITH THE IDEA

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:16.460 region:rollup2
THAT AWFULLY SOMEDAY IN THE

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:18.061 region:rollup2
FUTURE IT'S CLOSER TO WHAT YOU

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.629 region:rollup2
JUST LAID OUT.

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:19.863 region:rollup2
I'M HYI I WOULD SAY AND I

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:21.264 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:22.532 region:rollup2
YOU YOU ALL UPSET THROUGH THESE

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:23.533 region:rollup2
HEARINGS HALF WORK ON THESE

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:24.601 region:rollup2
ISSUES EVERY DAY.

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:26.503 region:rollup2
I MEAN THIS IS ENORMOUSLY

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:28.505 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED.

00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:30.707 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DESIGNING A SYSTEM.

00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:31.842 region:rollup2
IS COMPLICATED THINKING ABOUT

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:33.643 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF WAIVERS.

00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:34.478 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD REQUIRE THAT WOULD

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:35.112 region:rollup2
REQUIRE FROM THE FEDERAL

00:58:34.478 --> 00:58:37.180 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:58:35.112 --> 00:58:38.915 region:rollup2
IS TECHNICALLY COMPLICATED AS

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.617 region:rollup2
WELL AS POLITICALLY DIFFICULT.

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:41.084 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.185 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT HAPPENS

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:44.087 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT.

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:45.789 region:rollup2
SO I THINK YOU KNOW GOING

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:47.024 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF THINKING

00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:48.592 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:58:47.024 --> 00:58:50.293 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU WANNA DOT?

00:58:48.592 --> 00:58:51.561 region:rollup2
EVEN IF YOU CAN'T GET THERE.

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:52.696 region:rollup2
POLITICALLY WITH THE CURRENT

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:54.064 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS IMPORTANT

00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:55.599 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT PROCESS GUY COULD

00:58:54.064 --> 00:58:56.700 region:rollup2
VERY WELL TAKE YEARS.

00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:58.101 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.936 region:rollup2
AND SIMILARLY THINKING ABOUT

00:58:58.101 --> 00:59:01.772 region:rollup2
THE TRANSITION STEPS.

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:03.073 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT SAM. YOU KNOW

00:59:01.772 --> 00:59:04.841 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES AND HEALTH CARE AS IN

00:59:03.073 --> 00:59:06.376 region:rollup2
IN ALL OF PUBLIC POLICY WE THINK

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:07.677 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE TODAY.

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.945 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S COMPLETELY

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:09.546 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:11.081 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT TO

00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:13.016 region:rollup2
GET TO AND WHETHER THOSE

00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:14.885 region:rollup2
INCREMENTAL STEPS ARE. KIND OF

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:15.519 region:rollup2
ON THE PATH TO.

00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:17.454 region:rollup2
TO WHERE YOU ULTIMATELY WANT TO

00:59:15.519 --> 00:59:18.889 region:rollup2
GO.

00:59:17.454 --> 00:59:20.323 region:rollup2
ANSWER ONE FROM ITS HER ONE

00:59:18.889 --> 00:59:21.425 region:rollup2
FINAL QUESTION SOUND THE ONE

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:22.859 region:rollup2
MAJOR HEALTH CARE CHANGE IN OUR

00:59:21.425 --> 00:59:24.161 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:25.262 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR IN THAT WE HAD.

00:59:24.161 --> 00:59:27.364 region:rollup2
WAS THAT.

00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:28.465 region:rollup2
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND

00:59:27.364 --> 00:59:30.133 region:rollup2
HIS REPUBLICAN ALLIES HAVE

00:59:28.465 --> 00:59:31.401 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED THE INDIVIDUAL MAN.

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:32.102 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.370 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING WE

00:59:32.102 --> 00:59:35.605 region:rollup2
SHOULD TRY TO RESTORING

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:37.107 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IN THE NEAR TERM.

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:38.708 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK.

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:40.243 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA HAS.

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:41.611 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW DEBATED AN

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:42.846 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN IN THE

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:44.281 region:rollup2
PAST NUMBER YEARS AGO UNDER

00:59:42.846 --> 00:59:45.816 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER.

00:59:44.281 --> 00:59:47.284 region:rollup2
AND IT'S CERTAINLY A

00:59:45.816 --> 00:59:48.452 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL BUT CERTAINLY NOT

00:59:47.284 --> 00:59:50.787 region:rollup2
THE MOST POPULAR.

00:59:48.452 --> 00:59:50.987 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:53.090 region:rollup2
ACT.

00:59:50.987 --> 00:59:54.724 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY OUR POLLING SHOWS

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:56.226 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE.

00:59:54.724 --> 00:59:57.027 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF THE INDIVIDUAL

00:59:56.226 --> 00:59:59.029 region:rollup2
MANDATE.

00:59:57.027 --> 01:00:01.598 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S FAIR TO HELP BROADEN

00:59:59.029 --> 01:00:02.766 region:rollup2
THE RISK POOL LOWER PREMIUMS.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.266 region:rollup2
IT SURE THAT EVERYONE IS

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.267 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:07.804 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:09.339 region:rollup2
HAD IT HAS MUCH LESS OPPOSITION.

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:10.373 region:rollup2
DAN DAN INITIALLY.

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:12.142 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK CALIFORNIA

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:14.177 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY WITH THE INCOME TAX

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:15.545 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE WE HAVE HERE IS WELL

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:16.847 region:rollup2
POSITIONED TO IMPLEMENT AN

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:19.449 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:21.585 region:rollup2
IT IF YOU IF YOU SO CHOOSE.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:23.086 region:rollup2
YOUR MARYLAND IS ACTUALLY

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:24.387 region:rollup2
PURSUING.

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:25.155 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:26.022 region:rollup2
IT HAS AN INTERESTING IDEA TO

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:28.492 region:rollup2
ALLOW PEOPLE.

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:30.227 region:rollup2
TO SORT PUT ASIDE THEIR PENALTY.

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:31.761 region:rollup2
IN A FUND THAT THEY COULD DO

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:33.697 region:rollup2
AND USED TO BUY INSURANCE.

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.498 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A PENALTY THAT THAT

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.232 region:rollup2
THAT IS OF USE TO THAT

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:36.900 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL.

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:39.636 region:rollup2
LATER ON RATHER THAN JUST GOING

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:40.604 region:rollup2
INTO THE. INTO THE GENERAL FUND.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.139 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:43.440 region:rollup2
APPROACHES CALIFORNIA COULD TAKE

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.008 region:rollup2
AT AND MITIGATE THE EFFECT OF

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.710 region:rollup2
REPEALING INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:47.110 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.245 region:rollup2
EXPANDING OUTREACH

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.346 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:50.480 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:51.982 region:rollup2
OUT THERE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.383 region:rollup2
MEDICARE I'LL ELIGIBLE FOR

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.784 region:rollup2
PREMIUM SUBSIDIES FOR COVER

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:56.853 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. ABOUT ARE NOT

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:58.855 region:rollup2
ENROLLED SO EXPANDING OUT REACH.

01:00:56.853 --> 01:01:00.157 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE. A BIG EFFECT TO

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:01.691 region:rollup2
BRINGING HEALTH YOUR PEOPLE.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:03.226 region:rollup2
INTO THE POOL.

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:04.494 region:rollup2
AND EVEN CONSIDER EXPANDING.

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:06.296 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES.

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.898 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN MANY WAYS THAT THE

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:09.833 region:rollup2
STICK OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:10.500 region:rollup2
IS THE FLIP SIDE OF THE CARROT.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.169 region:rollup2
OF THE SUBSIDIES.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.903 region:rollup2
SO WITHOUT THE STICK EXPANDED

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:15.472 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES.

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:17.140 region:rollup2
COULD ALSO HELP IMPROVE IMPROVE

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:17.774 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.409 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:21.178 region:rollup2
YOU MISTER.

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:23.413 region:rollup2
TREATMENT SHIP QUESTION.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:25.582 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:27.317 region:rollup2
THIS WATER.

01:01:25.582 --> 01:01:29.186 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:30.353 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR COMING. I KNOW

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.821 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION SO

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.623 region:rollup2
I JUST TRIED IT.

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:35.125 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY GO OVER ONE OF THE

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:37.794 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT CAME TO MY ATTENTION

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:38.795 region:rollup2
WAS ON OLDER AMERICANS AND THAT

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.362 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:40.997 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH. TRYING TO ACCESS

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:43.066 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:44.768 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:46.770 region:rollup2
THESE HEARINGS WE'VE GOTTEN A

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:48.538 region:rollup2
LOT OF INFORMATION. THAT WE DID

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.806 region:rollup2
HAVE THE COMMONWEALTH FUND

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:51.007 region:rollup2
REPORT IT DURING ONE OF OUR

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.409 region:rollup2
HEARINGS WHICH WAS IN A VERY IN

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:54.244 region:rollup2
DEPTH.

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:55.512 region:rollup2
I AM. WE KNOW THAT OLDER

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:57.314 region:rollup2
AMERICANS HAVE WORSE HEALTH

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:58.848 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:59.816 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE PAYING HIGHER COSTS

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:01.785 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:03.820 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE US

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:05.288 region:rollup2
POPULATION WHAT WE'RE SEEING THE

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.557 region:rollup2
SILVER SO NAMI.

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:09.426 region:rollup2
MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND ADULTS

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:11.661 region:rollup2
TURNED SIXTY FIVE EVERYDAY.

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:13.330 region:rollup2
AND I'M BY TWENTY SIXTEEN NINETY

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:14.197 region:rollup2
POINT TWO MILLION AMERICANS

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:15.665 region:rollup2
ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:17.300 region:rollup2
POPULATION WILL BE SIXTY FIVE OR

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:18.235 region:rollup2
OLDER.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.136 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT YOU

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:22.305 region:rollup2
KNOW FROM WHAT WE SAW FROM THIS

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:25.709 region:rollup2
COMMONWEALTH. FUND.

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:27.544 region:rollup2
STUDY THAT.

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:28.578 region:rollup2
UNDER CORNER OF OLDER AMERICANS

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:30.780 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST YEAR AND NOT EVEN

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.681 region:rollup2
SEEN A DOCTOR WHEN THEY'RE SICK.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.383 region:rollup2
AND NOT FEEL DISTANT.

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:35.318 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION ORDERED SKIP THE

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:36.753 region:rollup2
MEDICATION DOSE WHEREAS IN OTHER

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:38.722 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.789 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING A LOT BETTER IN

01:02:38.722 --> 01:02:43.493 region:rollup2
THAT REGARD IN.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:45.528 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I.

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:46.830 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE YOU KNOW REALLY WOKE

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:48.698 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM A DUAL

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:50.834 region:rollup2
ROLE? MAYBE THEY WEREN'T INSURED

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:52.502 region:rollup2
AT ALL THAN THEIR INTO MEDICAID

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:55.605 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:57.007 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING ALL OF

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.141 region:rollup2
THAT AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THE

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:59.876 region:rollup2
TRENDS.

01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:01.745 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW AS FAR AS

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:03.046 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO KEEP.

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:05.382 region:rollup2
ACCESS IS WILL'S COVERAGE FOR

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:07.851 region:rollup2
THESE FOLKS.

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:09.619 region:rollup2
HERE I THINK YOU KNOW DE.

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:10.787 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL IT WITH THAT WITH

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:12.422 region:rollup2
OLDER AMERICANS ACT YOU KNOW

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:14.057 region:rollup2
MANY OF WHOM WERE UNINSURED

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:14.924 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE AND

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:15.625 region:rollup2
AND GAINED ELIGIBILITY FOR

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:18.061 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:20.063 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING THE EFFECTS OF.

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:21.765 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS OF LACK OF COVERAGE

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:22.932 region:rollup2
AND AND AND LACK OF ACCESS.

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:24.100 region:rollup2
AND THAT KIND OF COMES HOME TO

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:25.101 region:rollup2
ROOST.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.370 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY.

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:28.371 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE AND

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:30.206 region:rollup2
END UP IN IN MEDICARE.

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:31.541 region:rollup2
.

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:33.243 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I ALSO I MEAN

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.511 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IS A A UNIVERSAL NEAR

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:36.479 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL.

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:38.281 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR FOR OLDER AMERICANS.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.149 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S FAR FROM PERFECT

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:40.650 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:41.985 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF YOU STACKED

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.453 region:rollup2
MEDICARE UP TO A TYPICAL

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:45.188 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER PLAN IT DOESN'T ALWAYS

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:47.057 region:rollup2
COMPARE VERY WELL AND IT HAS

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:48.658 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL COST SHARING.

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:49.526 region:rollup2
NO CAP ON ON OUT OF POCKET

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.061 region:rollup2
COSTS.

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:51.695 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE COMPENSATE

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:53.296 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:54.531 region:rollup2
BY BUYING SUPPLEMENTAL

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.965 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IN ROLLING IN A

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:58.635 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.

01:03:55.965 --> 01:04:00.003 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURANCE PLAN.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:01.638 region:rollup2
OR OR THROUGH MEDI CAL.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:03.440 region:rollup2
OR MEDICAID AS A AS A TOOL

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:04.708 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE LIST IF THEIR INCOMES

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.110 region:rollup2
ARE ARE LOW.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:09.245 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW I EIGHT THINK WHAT

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:10.647 region:rollup2
WHILE WHILE MEDICARE IS IS DOES

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.748 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:13.717 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:16.019 region:rollup2

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:17.620 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS AND MEN AND SOME OF THE

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:19.923 region:rollup2
SAME PROBLEMS THAT THAT PLAGUE.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.990 region:rollup2
YEAH PLAGUE PLAGUE THE SYSTEM

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:22.792 region:rollup2

.

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:42.572 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT'S ANOTHER THING

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:44.007 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:45.708 region:rollup2
IN MY FEET FOR ANOTHER HEARING

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:47.443 region:rollup2
BUT HOW ARE OUR CURRENT RATES

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:49.979 region:rollup2
AND TRENDS OF THESE.

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:52.582 region:rollup2
TOPICS WILD CHILD CARE VISITS.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:54.918 region:rollup2
POST CARE HOW ARE THOSE.

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:57.754 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE EIGHT VERSUS.

01:05:54.918 --> 01:05:59.756 region:rollup2
OTHER NATIONS AS WELL AS.

01:05:57.754 --> 01:06:03.259 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMMERCIAL

01:05:59.756 --> 01:06:06.796 region:rollup2
INSURANCE MEDICO. MARKETPLACE.

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:08.198 region:rollup2
TO HAVE DATA ON THOSE THAT WE

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.166 region:rollup2
WAIT WE DO HAVE SOME THAT WOULD

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:10.767 region:rollup2
BE HAPPY TO TO TO PROVIDE THAT.

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.368 region:rollup2
AND.

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:14.604 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE WE TEND

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:15.371 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS ON ON COVERAGE IN AND

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:18.007 region:rollup2
COSTS.

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:20.910 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY THAT THE QUALITY

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:22.245 region:rollup2
OF HEALTHCARE THE OUTCOMES ARE.

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.913 region:rollup2
ARE JUST AS A POINT AND A

01:06:22.245 --> 01:06:25.315 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THOSE KIND OF LAUGHED

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:26.916 region:rollup2
AT A CENTRAL POINT OF

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.418 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY NOW AS WELL.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:30.119 region:rollup2
IN WHICH A COMPARED TO OTHER

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.820 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES I MEAN WE SPEND FAR

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:32.689 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.423 region:rollup2
THAN OTHER COUNTRIES ON ON

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:35.792 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:37.927 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN PERCENTOF GDP AND IN

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:38.928 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES COMPARED TO

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:39.996 region:rollup2
ELEVEN PERCENT IN.

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:41.097 region:rollup2
SIMILAR HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.899 region:rollup2
BUT INTERESTINGLY THOSE OTHER

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:44.367 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES TEND TO MAKE UP SOME

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:46.135 region:rollup2
OF THAT GAP THROUGH.

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:47.937 region:rollup2
SOCIAL SERVICES GOT A SPEND

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:49.639 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE ON THINGS LIKE HOUSING

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:50.073 region:rollup2
AND

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:51.774 region:rollup2
FOOD ASSISTANCE AND.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:53.209 region:rollup2
.

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:55.211 region:rollup2
AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES THAT.

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:57.113 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ARE NOT UNCONNECTED TO

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.914 region:rollup2
TO HEALTH CARE AND AND ACCESS TO

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:59.382 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU

01:06:57.914 --> 01:07:01.317 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT. PLAN THAT WILL TIE

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:02.418 region:rollup2
IN WITH THE SENIOR CITIZEN CARE

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:03.887 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM JUST NEED

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:07.056 region:rollup2
BASIC.

01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:07.957 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LIVING TO HELP THEM BUT

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:10.226 region:rollup2
JUST AS A RAPPER.

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:11.394 region:rollup2
.

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.662 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HIDEOUS

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:14.430 region:rollup2
CHARTS.

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:16.399 region:rollup2
A AND THEY COMPARED TO MARSHALL

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:18.001 region:rollup2
MEDICAID AND MEDICARE WELL

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:20.436 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE VISITS.

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:22.605 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:24.274 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL HMO AND PPO DOING

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:26.175 region:rollup2
FINE BUT THE MEDICAID HMO HAS

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:29.112 region:rollup2
THE LOWEST RATES OF.

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:30.079 region:rollup2
CHILD. WELL VISITS.

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:32.448 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE IT DOES EVERY THOSE

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:33.516 region:rollup2
COMPARISONS ARE ARE VERY TOUGH.

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:35.184 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:36.819 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMERCIAL INSURERS

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:38.588 region:rollup2
PRICKLY EMPLOYER BASED INSURERS

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:40.123 region:rollup2
ARE COVERING A VERY DIFFERENT.

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:41.224 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:43.126 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:44.727 region:rollup2
THAT THEN THERE MEDI CAL WHICH

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:45.929 region:rollup2
IS NOT SAY THERE AREN'T ISSUES

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.330 region:rollup2
OF ACCESS IN MEDI CAL I THINK

01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:50.099 region:rollup2
THEE THERE ARE.

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:51.935 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:53.303 region:rollup2
TO ZURICH CONTROLLER GUY IN A

01:07:51.935 --> 01:07:55.338 region:rollup2
STATISTICAL WAY.

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:57.473 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE THOSE VERY DIFFERENT

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:58.041 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS I MEAN I YOU KNOW

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:58.474 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEONE HAS LOW INCOME

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.342 region:rollup2
WHOSE.

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.810 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.611 region:rollup2
IF YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:03.313 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLD BUDGET.

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:04.080 region:rollup2
ON EVERYTHING INCLUDING

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:05.949 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.550 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TRIBE STRUCK WITH PAIN

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:09.152 region:rollup2
FOR FOOD STRUGGLE WITH HOUSING.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:10.620 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THEIR

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:14.991 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO TAXES HEALTH CARE AS

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:18.428 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:20.263 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:23.032 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FIRST I. WANTED TO

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:24.500 region:rollup2
REPEAT YOUR STATEMENT TO MAKE

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.735 region:rollup2
SURE I GOT IT CORRECT BUT. MY

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.669 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT YOU SAID

01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:27.570 region:rollup2
THAT NO ONE IS TRYING TO

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:30.506 region:rollup2
RECREATE OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:32.642 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:35.511 region:rollup2
I THINK I KNOW NO ONE WOULD.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:37.347 region:rollup2
YEAH. YEAH THAT FRAGMENTATION

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:38.281 region:rollup2
THEN SHOULD LEAD US TO REALLY

01:08:37.347 --> 01:08:39.749 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE CONSEQUENCES THAT

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:41.417 region:rollup2
YOU HAD ON YOUR PAGE

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:42.285 region:rollup2
SO I WANTED TO READ THEM BACK TO

YOU TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:46.856 region:rollup2
VALUES.

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:49.692 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT OR

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:51.427 region:rollup2
ARE WE A DIFFERENT ENTITY MOVING

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:53.129 region:rollup2
TOWARDS A DIFFERENT.

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:54.864 region:rollup2
SO YOU SAY BY HAVING A

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.632 region:rollup2
FRAGMENTED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WE

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:57.300 region:rollup2
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:08:55.632 --> 01:08:59.402 region:rollup2
CONTROL COSTS.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.237 region:rollup2
WE RISK DISRUPTIONS IN CARE AND

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:03.806 region:rollup2
WE AVOID CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:04.674 region:rollup2
FOR COST TO POPULATION HEALTH.

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:07.377 region:rollup2
WELL CREATING A TIERED

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:09.145 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:10.980 region:rollup2
THOSE STATEMENTS

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.982 region:rollup2
MAKE ME REALIZE THAT THIS

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.418 region:rollup2
FRAGMENTED HEALTHCARE DELIVERY

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.952 region:rollup2
MODEL. IS CAUSING SOME OF THE

01:09:15.418 --> 01:09:17.453 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH THEM

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:19.622 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:21.624 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:23.393 region:rollup2
A SAYING THAT IT'S A EUPHEMISM

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:25.395 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:27.163 region:rollup2
THE DOCTOR AWAY. THAT AN OUNCE

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:29.032 region:rollup2
OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:31.000 region:rollup2
OF CURE.

01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:32.301 region:rollup2
THAT FRAGMENTATION REALLY LEADS

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.970 region:rollup2
TO AN UNDER INVESTMENT IN

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:35.805 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:37.740 region:rollup2
OTHER AGENCIES THERE REALLY DO

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:38.374 region:rollup2
HELP TO KEEP OVERALL HEALTHCARE

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.410 region:rollup2
COSTS DOWN.

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:43.746 region:rollup2
MIGHT.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:45.748 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS GOING TO BE.

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:47.784 region:rollup2
IN YOUR CLOTHES YOU SAID THAT AN

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:49.652 region:rollup2
OPTION TO BUY EN.

01:09:47.784 --> 01:09:50.686 region:rollup2
OR AND ALL PAYER MODEL WERE TWO

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:52.455 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES THAT WE SHOULD

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:53.790 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:56.659 region:rollup2
AND I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND FROM

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:58.094 region:rollup2
YOU HOW THAT WOULD HELP US.

01:09:56.659 --> 01:10:00.196 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE CONSEQUENCES THAT

01:09:58.094 --> 01:10:02.832 region:rollup2
YOU LISTED HERE.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:03.032 region:rollup2
YES I I THINK IN IN IN A COUPLE

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.434 region:rollup2
WAYS.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.568 region:rollup2
.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:07.203 region:rollup2
A GREAT GREATER REGULATION OF

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:09.038 region:rollup2
PRICING AND AND ALL PAYER RATE

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.740 region:rollup2
SETTING SYSTEM.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:12.542 region:rollup2
.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.676 region:rollup2
WOULD IT WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.178 region:rollup2
THE COST SIDE.

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:16.546 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THING THAT.

01:10:15.178 --> 01:10:17.980 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE THING THAT

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.448 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE THIRD THE REASON WE

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.582 region:rollup2
SPEND SO MUCH MORE ON

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.616 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE.

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:22.452 region:rollup2
IN OTHER COUNTRIES IS NOT

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:23.886 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE USE MORE HEALTH CARE

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:24.821 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE WE PAY HIGHER

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:27.457 region:rollup2
PRICES.

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:28.524 region:rollup2
THEN THEN THAN OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:30.359 region:rollup2
SO IT ALL PAYER RATE SETTING

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:31.294 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF SOME SORT WOULD HELP

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:34.297 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS.

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:36.499 region:rollup2
THAT DEBT PRICE ISSUE.

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:37.867 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY STILL

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:38.835 region:rollup2
LEAVE A LOT OF THE OTHER

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:40.703 region:rollup2
FRAGMENTATION.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:41.137 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE WOULD

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:43.739 region:rollup2
STILL BE NETWORKS.

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:45.108 region:rollup2
OF OF PROVIDERS ALTHOUGH I

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:47.110 region:rollup2
THINK A MORE REGULATED PRICING

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:49.545 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE I WOULD EVEN.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:50.379 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT OUT AND INCREASED

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.647 region:rollup2
MORE UNIFORM NETWORKS.

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.982 region:rollup2
THERE STILL BE DIFFERENCES AND

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:54.517 region:rollup2
BENEFITS DIFFERENCES AND COST

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:56.452 region:rollup2
SHARING.

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:57.019 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BUT IT BUT A LOT OF

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:59.622 region:rollup2
THE.

01:10:57.019 --> 01:11:01.791 region:rollup2
KIND OF BACK AND COMPLICATION.

01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:03.292 region:rollup2
AND AND HIGH COST OF THE

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.093 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM COULD BE

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:05.495 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED.

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.163 region:rollup2
THROUGH THRALL PAIR RATE

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:08.631 region:rollup2
SETTING.

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:09.966 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS A BY AND AYE I

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:11.434 region:rollup2
WOULD SEE IS.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.802 region:rollup2
BUY INTO MEDICARE ALIBI INTO

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:15.671 region:rollup2
MEDICARE FEDERALLY.

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:17.106 region:rollup2
IS IS SORT OF A STEP IN THE

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:18.741 region:rollup2
DIRECTION. ARMED.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:21.611 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF.

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:23.779 region:rollup2
II IF A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IS.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:25.581 region:rollup2
IT IS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO GO

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:26.582 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT IT'S TOO DIFFICULT

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:28.251 region:rollup2
TO GET THEIR.

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:30.386 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY THEN.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:31.053 region:rollup2
A BY AND PARTICULARLY BY AND

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:33.256 region:rollup2
WHERE.

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:34.857 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE POPULATION EVEN

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:36.459 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS HAVE THE CHOICE OF

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:38.828 region:rollup2
BUYING INTO THAT SYSTEM.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:40.496 region:rollup2
IS A WAY OF KIND EASING INTO IT.

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:41.831 region:rollup2
SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:43.199 region:rollup2
GET THERE OVERNIGHT. DOESN'T GET

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:44.700 region:rollup2
THERE IMMEDIATELY IT DOESN'T

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:45.768 region:rollup2
ADDRESS ALL OF THE FRAGMENTATION

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.136 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY.

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:48.504 region:rollup2
BUT IT STARTS TO MOVE IN THAT

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.573 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:52.809 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I REALLY

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:54.177 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH FRAGMENTATION IS.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.244 region:rollup2
TURNING I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:57.213 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:58.581 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION BUT.

01:11:57.213 --> 01:12:01.150 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE TEND TO FOCUS OUR

01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:03.452 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS ON THE ON INSURED

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.720 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN THE UNDERINSURED OR

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:05.288 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.123 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:09.358 region:rollup2
AND.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:10.860 region:rollup2
WE MUST HAVE THAT SUBSTANTIVE

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:12.195 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE REMOVE

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.763 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT FRAGMENTATION SO

01:12:12.195 --> 01:12:14.664 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:16.566 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP WITH

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.899 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:18.067 region:rollup2
AND.

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:19.669 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST A COMMENT I WANNA

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:23.272 region:rollup2
LEAVE IT THERE UNTIL WE HEAR THE

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:24.407 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION LATER.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:26.275 region:rollup2
I WANNA THANK YOU OF MISTER

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:27.310 region:rollup2
LEVITT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:28.044 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW WILL HAVE YOU BACK

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.613 region:rollup2
AT THE END FOR.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:32.381 region:rollup2
DISH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT I

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:33.449 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST WANNA AND APPRECIATE

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.851 region:rollup2
THE OVERVIEW I THINK IT'S

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:37.587 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO SAT.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:38.187 region:rollup2
TO SET FOR SPECIAL FOR FOLKS

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:39.055 region:rollup2
WHO HAVEN'T BEEN TO ANY OF OUR

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.524 region:rollup2
HEARINGS BEFORE.

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:42.725 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.392 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH WHAT MAY BE THE

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:45.428 region:rollup2
ONLY THING I AGREE WITH WITH OUR

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:46.696 region:rollup2
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IS THAT

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:48.064 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE IS COMPLICATED.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.799 region:rollup2
AND.

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:50.399 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT I HAVE A REAL

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:52.668 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH SOME THE THINGS

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:54.637 region:rollup2
GOING ON OUT OF THE STATE.

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:55.104 region:rollup2
BUT YEAH I THINK IMPORTANT TO

01:12:54.637 --> 01:12:57.073 region:rollup2
ME.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:59.108 region:rollup2
THE TAKE AWAY FROM HERE IS.

01:12:57.073 --> 01:13:00.910 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONS AND I THINK THAT'S

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.711 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THE I

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.613 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH YOU.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:04.580 region:rollup2
KNOWING WHAT EVER INVENT THE

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.882 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WE HAVE IN THE UNITED

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.816 region:rollup2
STATES AGAIN.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.551 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN.

01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:10.353 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.821 region:rollup2
PROBLEM FOR ALL OF US FOR FOR A

01:13:10.353 --> 01:13:13.656 region:rollup2
VERY LONG TIME.

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:15.591 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:17.226 region:rollup2
ABOUT MEDICARE I'M I'M IN AND I

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.828 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THAT I HEAR FROM PEOPLE

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:20.696 region:rollup2
ALL THE TIME I WON A SINGLE

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:22.131 region:rollup2
PAYER MEDICARE FOR ALL UNIVERSAL

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:23.699 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:25.534 region:rollup2
AND I GO WOW WHAT DO YOU REALLY

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:26.269 region:rollup2
WANT. BECAUSE.

THEY'RE ALL DISTINCTLY

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:28.537 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT. AND I THINK WHAT

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:30.873 region:rollup2
PEOPLE REALLY WANT IS HIGH

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:31.440 region:rollup2
QUALITY CARE ON AT A REASONABLE

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:32.708 region:rollup2
COST.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.443 region:rollup2
DEAL GET TO DOCTORS.

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:35.945 region:rollup2
AND GET GET THE CARE THEY NEED

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:37.546 region:rollup2
WITHOUT BANKRUPTING THEM THAT'S

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.981 region:rollup2

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.720 region:rollup2
PERFECT SYSTEM.

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:46.555 region:rollup2
AND YOU THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.823 region:rollup2
COSTS RELATED TO THAT ON THAT

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:49.258 region:rollup2
THE OUR TRANSITIONS THAT ARE

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:51.527 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE INVOLVED ON TO TO

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:53.062 region:rollup2
GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO. AND.

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:54.463 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:55.031 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION TO

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:56.766 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THOSE THOSE ISSUES

01:13:55.031 --> 01:13:58.200 region:rollup2

BUT CHEER R. CENTER FOCUSES

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:58.421 region:rollup2

01:15:58.421 --> 01:16:02.491 region:rollup2

PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

AND.

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:13.335 region:rollup2
AND MORE RECENT EFFORTS TOO.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.670 region:rollup2
ROLLED OUT LAW BACK.

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:16.338 region:rollup2
I AM SO I'M GONNA TALK.

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:17.940 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY TODAY ABOUT THE

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:19.308 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE HEALTH

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.843 region:rollup2
INSURANCE MARKET.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:22.812 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE.

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:23.979 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN EMERGING

01:16:22.812 --> 01:16:25.548 region:rollup2
AROUND PLAN CHOICE AND THE

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:26.982 region:rollup2
PRICES THAT CONSUMERS PAY IN

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:28.951 region:rollup2
THAT MARKET.

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:31.053 region:rollup2
YOU SAW A LITTLE BIT FROM.

01:16:28.951 --> 01:16:32.221 region:rollup2
LARRY LEVITT SLIDES BUT I THINK

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:34.256 region:rollup2
SOME KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:36.092 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MARKET IN CALIFORNIA

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:38.260 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS IN OTHER STATES.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:39.862 region:rollup2
IS A RELATIVELY SMALL MARKET

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.530 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY COMPARED TO.

01:16:39.862 --> 01:16:42.998 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:45.234 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS EMPLOYER BASED OR.

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:47.603 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE.

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:48.771 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY TWO POINT THREE MILLION

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:50.072 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ENROLLED.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:51.640 region:rollup2
WITH OVER HALF OF THEM IN

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:53.142 region:rollup2
COVERED CALIFORNIA.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.911 region:rollup2
AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE.

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:57.346 region:rollup2
RECEIVING PREMIUM SUBSIDIES.

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:58.814 region:rollup2
YOU COMPARE THAT TO MEDI CAL

01:16:57.346 --> 01:17:00.015 region:rollup2
WITH TEN POINT FIVE MILLION OUR

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:01.450 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE WITH

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:03.152 region:rollup2
ELEVEN POINT EIGHT IT'S A IT'S A

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.086 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY SMALL MARKET. IT ALSO

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:05.321 region:rollup2
TENDS TO BE A FAIRLY

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:07.523 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONAL MARKET.

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:08.724 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CYCLE AND AND CYCLE OUT

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:10.192 region:rollup2
WHICH IS VERY ARM BUT THEY'RE

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:11.193 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:12.628 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:14.130 region:rollup2
ANY COULD BE DUE TO LIFE

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:15.397 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES IT COULD BE YOUR

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:16.832 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW RECENT COLLEGE GRAD WHO

01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:18.467 region:rollup2
JUST HASN'T QUITE FIGURED OUT

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:20.269 region:rollup2
THEIR CAREER PATH YOU HAD OR.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.670 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE AGED MOM WHO DECIDES

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:23.339 region:rollup2
TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF WORK TO

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:24.907 region:rollup2
CARE FOR AN AGING PARENT IT

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:26.141 region:rollup2
COULD BE THAT PERSON YOU DECIDES

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:28.344 region:rollup2
TO TAKE OFF WORK ON IT A YEAR

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:29.745 region:rollup2
TOO EARLY BEFORE THEY TURN SIXTY

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:31.680 region:rollup2
FIVE AND BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:33.048 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ALSO COULD BE INCOME

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.283 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT MIGHT CAUSE YOU TO

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:35.551 region:rollup2
COME INTO THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:37.219 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GET MORE

01:17:35.551 --> 01:17:37.653 region:rollup2
HOURS AT WORK OUR SMALL PAY

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:38.821 region:rollup2
RAISE YOU COULD LOSE

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.189 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:41.991 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICAID.

01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:43.559 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO I THINK IMPORTANT

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:44.860 region:rollup2
NO DOUBT WHILE THIS IS A SMALL

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:46.862 region:rollup2
MARKET IT'S A TRANSITIONAL

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:49.131 region:rollup2
MARKET FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:51.467 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY MARKET AND THEY ARE

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:53.869 region:rollup2
THERE FOR A LONG TIME FEES MIGHT

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:56.438 region:rollup2
BE ENTREPRENEURS. ARTISTS.

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:58.007 region:rollup2
MUSICIANS FREELANCERS OUT

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:59.608 region:rollup2
FARMERS AND RANCHERS IT'S REALLY

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:01.343 region:rollup2
CRITICAL FOR THOSE FOLKS THIS IS

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:02.578 region:rollup2
REALLY THE MARKET THAT THEY HAVE

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.212 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GOT TO BE STABLE AND

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:05.948 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE FOR

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:07.716 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:09.485 region:rollup2
I DON'T TALK A WHOLE LOT ABOUT

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:10.619 region:rollup2
THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE ACA

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:11.587 region:rollup2
BROUGHT TO THE INTERNAL MARKET

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:13.255 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK AFTER THESE

01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:15.190 region:rollup2
HEARINGS YOU PROBABLY ARE PRETTY

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:16.191 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH THOSE. ON BUT AS

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.593 region:rollup2
WE THINK ABOUT THE WAY THE

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.994 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MARKET HAS EVOLVED

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:20.596 region:rollup2
AND WHERE IT'S GOING OVER IN THE

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:21.530 region:rollup2
YEARS TO COME I THINK IT'S

01:18:20.596 --> 01:18:22.131 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TO THINK A LITTLE BIT

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:25.167 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ACA. IN SOME WAYS IS

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:26.402 region:rollup2
A.

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:28.938 region:rollup2
DALLEK KID IN GRAND BARGAIN

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:30.839 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT INSURERS

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:31.941 region:rollup2
AND CONSUMERS RIGHT SO ON THE

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:33.409 region:rollup2
ONE HAND THE GOVERNMENT SAID TO

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:35.110 region:rollup2

GUARANTEED ISSUE YOU CAN'T

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.350 region:rollup2
CHARGE THEM A HIGHER RATE. ON

01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:43.419 region:rollup2
YOU GOTTA COVER A PRETTY BASIC

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:45.788 region:rollup2
SET OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS

MANDATE.

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:29.331 region:rollup2
THE LOSS OF THE COST SHARING

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:30.666 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES ON WHICH THE TRUMP

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:32.668 region:rollup2

01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:34.403 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS RECENT EFFORTS.

01:19:32.668 --> 01:19:36.572 region:rollup2
BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO

ENCOURAGE THE EXPANSION AND SALE

01:19:36.572 --> 01:19:40.142 region:rollup2

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:48.817 region:rollup2
POLICIES TO STICK

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:49.852 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ALL OF THOSE ISSUES ARE

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:52.221 region:rollup2
STARTING TO FRAY DIED.

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:54.323 region:rollup2
BARGAIN AND AND CAUSING.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:55.491 region:rollup2
MANY INSURERS THAT ARE

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:56.625 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN THE MARKETPLACE

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.459 region:rollup2
IS TO WONDER WHETHER THAT THE

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:59.695 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REMAIN

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:01.030 region:rollup2
A TRUSTED PARTNER.

01:19:59.695 --> 01:20:02.364 region:rollup2
THAT'S AND I THINK IT'S

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:05.134 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT STATE

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:07.169 region:rollup2
LEVEL DECISIONS REALLY DO MATTER

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.070 region:rollup2
I'M CALIFORNIA'S A GREAT EXAMPLE

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:11.040 region:rollup2
OF THAT.

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:12.908 region:rollup2
WITH ROBUST PUBLIC OUTREACH AND.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.643 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT CAMPAIGNS EARLY

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.644 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT REALLY LIMITED

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.446 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.914 region:rollup2
.

01:20:17.446 --> 01:20:20.716 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT SOME EXCHANGES

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:23.285 region:rollup2
ARE FACED WITH.

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:25.320 region:rollup2
SICK OR OVERLY SICK POPULATIONS.

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:26.955 region:rollup2
AND COVERED CALIFORNIA'S ACT OF

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.257 region:rollup2
PURCHASING MODEL OVERALL

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:30.059 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS IN MUCH BETTER

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:31.560 region:rollup2
SHAPE THAN STATES WITH THE

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:33.429 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY RUN MARKETPLACES AND

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:35.898 region:rollup2
ALSO JUST A FEW INDICATORS OF

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:37.433 region:rollup2
THOUGHT SO. THIS SLIDE SHOWS ON

01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:38.600 region:rollup2
PLAN PARTICIPATION IN THE

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:40.069 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY FACILITATED

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.737 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE IS OUR FF I'M

01:20:40.069 --> 01:20:43.505 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO COVERED CALIFORNIA.

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:45.040 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:46.408 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU'LL SEE

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.444 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:49.211 region:rollup2
HAVE ELEVEN CARRIERS AND AND

01:20:48.444 --> 01:20:50.913 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAVE ELEVEN

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:52.181 region:rollup2
CARRIERS. FOR THE ALPHA FOUND

01:20:50.913 --> 01:20:52.715 region:rollup2
THAT AVERAGE JUST SLIPPED FROM

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.717 region:rollup2
FIVE CARRIERS PER STATE TO

01:20:52.715 --> 01:20:55.984 region:rollup2
THREE.

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:57.720 region:rollup2
AND FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF

01:20:55.984 --> 01:21:01.123 region:rollup2
COUNTIES NATIONWIDE HAVE JUST

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:02.825 region:rollup2
ONE INSURER PARTICIPATING.

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:04.560 region:rollup2
NOW I WOULD SAY THIS REMARKABLE

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:07.830 region:rollup2
STABILITY THAT WE SEE IN COVERED

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.364 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DOES MASK SOME EXITS

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:10.899 region:rollup2
AND ENTRANCES WAS AYE UNITED

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:12.901 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE LEAVE EARLY ON AN

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:15.404 region:rollup2
OSCAR COMMAND. IT ALSO MASKS

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:17.106 region:rollup2
SOME BIG REGIONAL CHANGES ON FOR

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:20.042 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE RECENT RETRENCHMENT

01:21:17.106 --> 01:21:21.176 region:rollup2
OF BOTH ANTHEM AND HEALTH.

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:22.244 region:rollup2
NOT TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE AND

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:23.278 region:rollup2
DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT IN THE

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:25.347 region:rollup2
PLAN CHOICE THAT COVER

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:26.949 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES HERE ARE

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:28.617 region:rollup2
FACING AND I'D LIKE TO. THANK

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:29.618 region:rollup2
AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CALIFORNIA

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:30.452 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND THE

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:31.587 region:rollup2
WORK OF.

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:33.989 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEIR ANALYSTS KATY

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:36.058 region:rollup2
WILSON WHO REALLY HELPED ME PULL

01:21:33.989 --> 01:21:37.960 region:rollup2
AND ANALYZE SOME OF THIS DATA.

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:40.195 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:42.398 region:rollup2
HERE WITH THIS THIS SLIDE IS.

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:43.732 region:rollup2
THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:45.234 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN ABOUT FIVE

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.701 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF COVERED CALIFORNIA

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:47.736 region:rollup2
AND COVERED CALIFORNIA

01:21:45.701 --> 01:21:49.671 region:rollup2
ENROLLEES.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.305 region:rollup2
ONLY HAVE ONE INSURER TO CHOOSE

01:21:49.671 --> 01:21:52.508 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:54.276 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S BEEN A DECLINE FROM

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:55.410 region:rollup2
ALMOST HALF OF COVERED

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:57.379 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES HUMMING

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:59.148 region:rollup2
SIR MORE INSURER OPTIONS TO JUST

01:21:57.379 --> 01:22:01.450 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT HAVING SIX

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:03.085 region:rollup2
OR MORE OPTIONS.

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:04.853 region:rollup2
AND THIS SLICES SHOWS A.

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:07.022 region:rollup2
AT A LITTLE BIT HOW THE

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:08.857 region:rollup2
POPULATION IS AFFECTED BY THIS.

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:09.925 region:rollup2
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE VERY

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:12.861 region:rollup2
SMALL FONT.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:16.265 region:rollup2
BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT.

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:17.633 region:rollup2
IT'S RELATIVELY FEW ENROLLEES

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:19.835 region:rollup2
IN THESE AREAS WITH FEWER

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:22.538 region:rollup2
CHOICES SIXTY SIX THOUSAND.

01:22:19.835 --> 01:22:24.206 region:rollup2
COVER CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES HAVE

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:26.008 region:rollup2
ONE CARRIER.

01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:27.943 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE THAT EFFECT

01:22:26.008 --> 01:22:30.212 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATED IN IN MONTEREY

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:31.513 region:rollup2
SANTA BARBARA SAN LUIS OBISPO

01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:33.482 region:rollup2
YOU COMPARE THAT WITH.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:35.918 region:rollup2
MORE POPULATED AREAS SUCH AS

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:37.753 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES COUNTY ON RETAINING

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:40.022 region:rollup2
A PRETTY ROBUST CHOICE OF

01:22:37.753 --> 01:22:41.123 region:rollup2
INSURERS.

01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:43.859 region:rollup2
OF COURSE ANOTHER IMPORTANT

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:45.561 region:rollup2
INDICATOR OF A MARKETS HEALTH

01:22:43.859 --> 01:22:47.629 region:rollup2
OUR PREMIUM TRENDS.

01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:49.331 region:rollup2
AND HERE AGAIN COVER CALIFORNIA

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.866 region:rollup2
IS DOING PRETTY DARN WELL.

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:52.801 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE HERE THAT THE

01:22:50.866 --> 01:22:53.602 region:rollup2
AVERAGE PREMIUM GROWTH IN THE

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.970 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY FACILITATED

01:22:53.602 --> 01:22:56.071 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE VERSUS COVERED

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:58.307 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:59.575 region:rollup2
IN BOTH PLACES BETWEEN TWENTY

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.776 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:02.244 region:rollup2
STARTED BETWEEN SORT OF THREE

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:03.879 region:rollup2
AND FOUR PERCENT.

01:23:02.244 --> 01:23:04.480 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT I'M SORRY PREMIUM

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:07.149 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:08.617 region:rollup2
BUT BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:11.053 region:rollup2
THE PREMIUM GROWTH IN THE ITEM

01:23:08.617 --> 01:23:12.688 region:rollup2
WAS THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT WARS

01:23:11.053 --> 01:23:14.356 region:rollup2
AND COVERED CALIFORNIA WAS JUST

01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:16.558 region:rollup2
TWELVE POINT FIVE PERCENT. AND I

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:18.093 region:rollup2
THINK THAT REALLY DOES BEGAN

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:20.229 region:rollup2
POINT TO SOME OF THE STRONG

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:21.930 region:rollup2
POLICY DECISIONS ON THAT THE

01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:23.799 region:rollup2
STATE MADE EARLY ON.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:25.767 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS ALONG THE WAY. OF

01:23:23.799 --> 01:23:27.202 region:rollup2
COURSE AND A AS WITH EVERYTHING

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:28.637 region:rollup2
IN HEALTHCARE YOU'VE TO DRILL

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:30.906 region:rollup2
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

01:23:28.637 --> 01:23:32.808 region:rollup2
THESE AVERAGES THE STATE WIDE

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:34.977 region:rollup2
AVERAGES DO YOU MASK IMPORTANT

01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:37.012 region:rollup2
REGIONAL VARIATIONS.

01:23:34.977 --> 01:23:38.714 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE MUCH BIGGER

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:40.048 region:rollup2
PREMIUM INCREASES IN THE

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:42.451 region:rollup2
NORTHERN COUNTIES.

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:44.219 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PERCENT BETWEEN

01:23:42.451 --> 01:23:46.355 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTEEN AND

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:49.458 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN COMPARED MUCH LOWER.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:50.692 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN MORE URBAN AREAS

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:51.360 region:rollup2
LIKE SACRAMENTO AND SAN FRAN.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:51.927 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S DRIVING INSURER

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:58.367 region:rollup2
DECISIONS HERE AND WE HAD AN

01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:59.768 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO GO

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.302 region:rollup2
OUT IN THE FIELD LAST YEAR AN

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:02.905 region:rollup2
INTERVIEW A WIDE RANGE OF

01:24:00.302 --> 01:24:04.373 region:rollup2
ENSURE.

01:24:02.905 --> 01:24:05.774 region:rollup2
BENEATH ABOUT WHAT.

01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:06.775 region:rollup2
WAS CAUSING THEM TO NO LONGER

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:08.010 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE OR TO CONTINUE

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:09.678 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN THE MARKET

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:12.314 region:rollup2
PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

01:24:09.678 --> 01:24:14.149 region:rollup2
AND AT THE FIRST THING  WOULD

01:24:12.314 --> 01:24:15.817 region:rollup2
JUST SAY IS THAT INSURERS HERE

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:17.819 region:rollup2
ARE NOT MONOLITHIC IN THEIR

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:19.588 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO A LARGE NATIONAL FOR

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:20.756 region:rollup2
PROFIT CARRIER LIKE UNITED. IS

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:21.957 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT

01:24:20.756 --> 01:24:23.892 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAN A REGIONAL

01:24:21.957 --> 01:24:25.494 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT WHICH AGAIN MIGHT HAVE

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:27.629 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN OF

01:24:25.494 --> 01:24:29.031 region:rollup2
FORMER MEDICAID ONLY PLAN OR AT

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:30.666 region:rollup2
THE BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD

01:24:29.031 --> 01:24:32.401 region:rollup2
CARRIERS. AND THEY'RE OF COURSE

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:33.468 region:rollup2
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES ON IN MANY

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:36.271 region:rollup2
STATES THE BLUE CROSS BLUE

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:37.806 region:rollup2
SHIELD PLAN IS THE BACKBONE OR

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:39.541 region:rollup2
IN MANY CASES THE ONLY CARRIER

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:40.976 region:rollup2
ON THE EXCHANGE.

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:42.678 region:rollup2
BUT IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:44.146 region:rollup2
IOWA THE BLUE CROSS PLAN NEVER

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:46.615 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED

01:24:44.146 --> 01:24:47.149 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING BUT WE DID PICK UP

01:24:46.615 --> 01:24:49.384 region:rollup2
ON SOME I THINK IMPORTANT

01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:51.420 region:rollup2
THEMES.

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:52.921 region:rollup2
AREN'T NUMBER ONE.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:55.958 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:57.359 region:rollup2
CARRIERS NETWORK NETWORK NIGHT

01:24:55.958 --> 01:24:58.961 region:rollup2
MY NETWORK BUILDING AND

01:24:57.359 --> 01:25:01.463 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING THAT PROVIDER

01:24:58.961 --> 01:25:03.432 region:rollup2
NETWORK AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:04.933 region:rollup2
CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING AND

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:08.203 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:10.706 region:rollup2
OFTEN THERE'S ONLY ONE HOSPITAL

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:12.174 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OR PROVIDER THERE'S

01:25:10.706 --> 01:25:15.077 region:rollup2
PROVIDER GROUP.

01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:19.214 region:rollup2
THAT HAS AN EFFECTIVE MONOPOLY

01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:20.782 region:rollup2
ON THAT CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:21.683 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE CARRIERS.

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.851 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO REALLY HER

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:24.519 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF OVERALL

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:25.087 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO WE FOUND GENERALLY

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:27.089 region:rollup2
THAT CARRIERS THAT PRE A CA

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:27.623 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:25:27.089 --> 01:25:29.491 region:rollup2
STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THE

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:30.826 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MARKET OR HAD STRONG.

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:31.927 region:rollup2
SHARE IN AND LOW INCOME

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:33.161 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS PERHAPS BECAUSE OF

01:25:31.927 --> 01:25:34.496 region:rollup2
MEDICAID BUSINESS HAVE TENDED TO

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:36.298 region:rollup2
STAY COMMITTED TO THE MARKET

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:37.232 region:rollup2
PLACES. ON CONVERSELY INSURERS

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.467 region:rollup2
THAT HAD A SMALL INDIVIDUAL

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:39.735 region:rollup2
MARKET PRESENCE BEFORE THE ACA

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:41.236 region:rollup2
OR WHOSE BUSINESS MODELS WERE

01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:42.137 region:rollup2
VERY DEPENDENT ON RISK SELECTION

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:43.438 region:rollup2
OUR UNDERWRITING.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:45.173 region:rollup2
HASN'T BEEN MOST LIKELY TO EXIT

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:46.108 region:rollup2
THE MARKET.

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:47.509 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE ABILITY TO SET

01:25:46.108 --> 01:25:49.277 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS ARE PRICE FOR RISK

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:50.579 region:rollup2
IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL AND.

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:51.613 region:rollup2
ONE THING ABOUT INSURANCE

01:25:50.579 --> 01:25:52.280 region:rollup2
COMPANIES IS THERE THAT KIND OF

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:53.882 region:rollup2
RISK AVERSE.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.984 region:rollup2
IF IF.

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:56.752 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S TIME MIGHT SURPRISE

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:58.654 region:rollup2
YOU BUT IT'S TRUE.

01:25:56.752 --> 01:25:59.821 region:rollup2
BUT PRICING FOR RISK IS.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:00.889 region:rollup2
.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.424 region:rollup2
CAN BE CHALLENGING IN RURAL

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:04.593 region:rollup2
AREAS AND SOME OF THAT IS JUST

01:26:02.424 --> 01:26:05.961 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF POPULATION DENSITY

01:26:04.593 --> 01:26:08.230 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A COUNTY

01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:08.797 region:rollup2
IN OHIO THAT. FOR THE LONGEST

01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:09.765 region:rollup2
TIME THEY COULDN'T GET AN

01:26:08.797 --> 01:26:10.966 region:rollup2
INSURER TO GO IN THERE THERE

01:26:09.765 --> 01:26:12.300 region:rollup2
WERE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND

01:26:10.966 --> 01:26:13.468 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:16.538 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE ENROLLEES IN THAT

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:19.207 region:rollup2
COUNTY WELL JUST ONE PERSON WITH

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:21.276 region:rollup2
HEMOPHILIA OUR A NEO NAY BABY OR

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:22.077 region:rollup2
AN ORGAN TRANSPLANT CAN TOTALLY

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:23.311 region:rollup2
THROW OFF YOUR ACTUAR THE

01:26:22.077 --> 01:26:24.713 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS IN YOUR PRICING

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:27.049 region:rollup2
STRATEGY.

01:26:24.713 --> 01:26:28.784 region:rollup2
AND THE RISKS FOR CARRIERS

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:30.152 region:rollup2
THERE ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:32.554 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT THEIR

01:26:30.152 --> 01:26:34.022 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS FOR REGULATORY REVIEW

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:35.724 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO A YEAR BEFORE THEY'RE

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:38.593 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT.

01:26:35.724 --> 01:26:40.028 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A LONG LAG TIME

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:42.030 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY THOSE RATES ARE INTO

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:43.198 region:rollup2
FACT IN A LOT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.533 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU PUT THEM FORWARD FOR

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:46.301 region:rollup2
REGULATORY REVIEW AND WHEN YOU

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:47.803 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY USE THEM. AND OF COURSE

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:49.371 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONLY MADE MORE DIFFICULT

01:26:47.803 --> 01:26:50.972 region:rollup2
AND AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:52.808 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY UNCERTAIN AND THAT

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:54.242 region:rollup2
CAN CHANGE ON YOU AT ANY MOMENT

01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:55.243 region:rollup2
AND THE DECISION OF THE TRUMP

01:26:54.242 --> 01:26:56.912 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ON THE COST

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:59.047 region:rollup2
SHARING SUBSIDIES IS JUST ONE

01:26:56.912 --> 01:27:01.249 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:03.118 region:rollup2
I'M BUT SHOULD WE CARE RIGHT.

01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:04.786 region:rollup2
WE ULTIMATELY SAW ALL COUNTIES

01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:06.655 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTRY COVERED THIS YOUR

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:08.657 region:rollup2
I'M AND MAYBE IT'S OKAY IF AN

01:27:06.655 --> 01:27:10.659 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANY HAS A MONOPOLY

01:27:08.657 --> 01:27:12.260 region:rollup2
IN A GIVEN AREA ON MAYBE THAT

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:14.029 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM RIGHT THEY.

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.696 region:rollup2
CAN SET THEIR PRICES AS HIGH AS

01:27:14.029 --> 01:27:17.466 region:rollup2
THEY WANT.

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:18.934 region:rollup2
BUT IN GENERAL I'M WE SEE THAT

01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:21.269 region:rollup2
THERE ARE REAL BENEFITS FOR

01:27:18.934 --> 01:27:23.605 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WHEN OUR PLAN CHOICES.

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:25.140 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY FIRST AND FOREMOST

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:26.274 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY AND WE'LL SEE AND

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:28.677 region:rollup2
I'LL SHOW YOU IN A COUPLE MORE

01:27:26.274 --> 01:27:30.645 region:rollup2
SLIDES MORE INSURERS MEANS.

01:27:28.677 --> 01:27:32.714 region:rollup2
LOWER PRICES

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:34.182 region:rollup2
ALSO AT LEAST IN THEORY.

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:35.217 region:rollup2
IT KNOWING THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:37.319 region:rollup2
CAN VOTE WITH THEIR FEET EVERY

01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:38.620 region:rollup2
YEAR PROMISE INSURERS TO PAY

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:40.589 region:rollup2
MORE ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:42.591 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND IMPROVE QUALITY.

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:44.392 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE ALSO RISKS.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:45.093 region:rollup2
THE WAY THE MARKET PLACES ARE

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:47.262 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:48.797 region:rollup2
YOU TO MAINTAIN THE VALUE OF

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:50.332 region:rollup2
YOUR PREMIUM TAX CREDIT

01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:52.567 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS HAVE TO SHOP AND THEY

01:27:50.332 --> 01:27:53.835 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SHOP EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:55.370 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES IT MORE LIKELY

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:57.272 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO SWITCH PLANS

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:58.907 region:rollup2
SWITCH NETWORKS BECOME THERE'S

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:59.407 region:rollup2
MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR CONSUMER

01:27:58.907 --> 01:28:01.710 region:rollup2
CONFUSION BENEFIT DESIGN

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:02.744 region:rollup2
CHANGES.

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:04.079 region:rollup2
ALL THAT CAN AFFECT OVERALL

01:28:02.744 --> 01:28:05.413 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF CARE AND THE

01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:06.448 region:rollup2
CONTINUITY OF CARE PARTICULAR

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:08.550 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:09.851 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:10.952 region:rollup2
SO THESE NEXT TWO SLIDES I'M I

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:12.721 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE URBAN

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:14.456 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE FOR THIS REALLY.

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:15.824 region:rollup2
SORT OF DROVE DOWN INTO THE

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:17.759 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AND THE

01:28:15.824 --> 01:28:19.628 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF COMPETITION ON

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:21.062 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY. SO WE'LL JUST SEE

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:23.698 region:rollup2
HERE ON THE SHOWS THE AVERAGE

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:25.934 region:rollup2
BENCHMARK MONTHLY PREMIUM BY

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:28.370 region:rollup2
ENSURE PARTICIPATION SO FOR.

01:28:25.934 --> 01:28:30.605 region:rollup2
AREAS WITH JUST ONE INSURER THE

01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:31.840 region:rollup2
AVERAGE MONTHLY PREMIUM IS ABOUT

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:33.208 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:36.111 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:37.546 region:rollup2
BUT IN AREAS WITH SIX OR MORE

01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:38.146 region:rollup2
INSURERS THAT DROPS TO TWO

01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:39.714 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS A

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:42.017 region:rollup2
MONTH.

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:43.518 region:rollup2
SO MORE CARRIERS TENDS TO MEAN

01:28:42.017 --> 01:28:44.853 region:rollup2
LOWER PRICES WITH THAT SORT OF

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:47.389 region:rollup2
KEY CUT POINT I THINK BETWEEN

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:48.790 region:rollup2
TWO AND THREE CARRIERS. AND THIS

01:28:47.389 --> 01:28:49.724 region:rollup2
SLIDE JUST CLOSE UP SHOWS A

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:52.093 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:53.829 region:rollup2
ANGLE ON THAT SHOWING MEDIUM

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:55.530 region:rollup2
PERCENT SHEEN'S IN THE BENCHMARK

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:57.232 region:rollup2
PREMIUM BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:58.433 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW

01:28:57.232 --> 01:29:00.669 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS WENT UP ACROSS THE

01:28:58.433 --> 01:29:01.336 region:rollup2
BOARD AND TWENTY. SEVENTEEN BUT

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:03.505 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE THAT.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:05.207 region:rollup2
AREAS WITH JUST ONE ENSURE HAD

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:06.374 region:rollup2
AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASES OF

01:29:05.207 --> 01:29:06.942 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT.

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:09.110 region:rollup2
WHEREAS.

01:29:06.942 --> 01:29:10.812 region:rollup2
IT COUNTIES WITH ONLY WITH SIX

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:14.382 region:rollup2
OR MORE CARRIERS HAD INCREASES

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:16.952 region:rollup2
OF ONLY FIVE PERCENT.

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:18.386 region:rollup2
SO IS WE LOOKED ACROSS THE

01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:20.455 region:rollup2
STATES CONFRONTING.

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:22.657 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WITH SINGLE ISSUE

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:25.160 region:rollup2
ARE BARE INSURER COUNTIES.

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:25.827 region:rollup2
WE REALLY SAW A WIDE RANGE OF

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.863 region:rollup2
STATE ACTIONS.

01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:28.964 region:rollup2
AND.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:30.398 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WITHOUT ALONG A

01:29:28.964 --> 01:29:32.133 region:rollup2
CONTINUUM FROM.

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:34.402 region:rollup2
MORE GOVERNMENT.

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:36.471 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ACTIONS SUCH AS OUR

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:38.340 region:rollup2
MEDICAID BUY IN LEGISLATION IN

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:40.575 region:rollup2
NEVADA AND MINNESOTA TO.

01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:41.643 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS DIED ON TO AND

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:42.444 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA

01:29:41.643 --> 01:29:44.679 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE

01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:47.249 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAM OR THE STATE

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:48.984 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES BENEFIT PROGRAM YOU.

01:29:47.249 --> 01:29:50.552 region:rollup2
HIDE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:52.120 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE AND A NUMBER OF

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:53.622 region:rollup2
STATES DID IT TOOK ON A NUMBER

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:56.291 region:rollup2
OF REGULATORY.

01:29:53.622 --> 01:29:57.259 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE RISK

01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:59.494 region:rollup2
FOR CARRIERS.

01:29:57.259 --> 01:30:01.062 region:rollup2
TO FOR EXAMPLE WASHINGTON AND

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:03.131 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN BE LOOKING AT THEIR

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:04.766 region:rollup2
OPERATING AREAS OHIO ALLOWED

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:05.900 region:rollup2
CARRIERS TO DROP GOLD LEVEL

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:08.403 region:rollup2
PLANS.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:10.772 region:rollup2
IOWA GAVE CARRIERS ACCESS TO

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:12.774 region:rollup2
PREMIUM DATA THERE WERE A NUMBER

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:16.344 region:rollup2
OF ACTIONS THAT STATES HAVE

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:16.912 region:rollup2
TAKEN TO TRY TO MAKE THIS RISKY

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:18.313 region:rollup2
SITUATION LAST RISKY

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:20.215 region:rollup2
CARRIERS.

01:30:18.313 --> 01:30:21.049 region:rollup2
OHIO GAVE INSURERS MORE

01:30:20.215 --> 01:30:22.217 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY AND NETWORK DESIGN

01:30:21.049 --> 01:30:23.952 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS OF COURSE JUST USED

WHICH WORKED FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:30:25.287 --> 01:30:28.556 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE ON LESS SUSTAINABLE

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:29.691 region:rollup2
LONG TERM.

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:32.994 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I WILL CLOSE IN THE

AB THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.068 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION WE BELIEVE THAT ALL

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.036 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:49.704 region:rollup2
TO COMPREHENSIVE AFFORDABLE

01:31:48.036 --> 01:31:50.939 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:52.140 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE BEEN MONITORING ACCESS

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:54.309 region:rollup2
TO CARE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:55.877 region:rollup2
FOR TWO DECADES.

01:31:54.309 --> 01:31:56.411 region:rollup2
ARE PARTNERING WITH US IN THE

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:56.878 region:rollup2
TOP RESEARCHERS HERE IN

01:31:56.411 --> 01:31:58.980 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS

01:31:56.878 --> 01:32:01.049 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY.

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:02.450 region:rollup2
AND A ALSO PARTNER WITHOUT MANY

01:32:01.049 --> 01:32:04.419 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PARTNERS IN THE PUBLIC

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:06.254 region:rollup2
AND PRIVATE SECTOR TO IMPROVE

01:32:04.419 --> 01:32:08.289 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO COVERAGE IN CARE. FOR

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:09.124 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS.

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:10.692 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE ALSO PART IN RECENT

01:32:09.124 --> 01:32:12.127 region:rollup2
YEARS WITH THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:13.495 region:rollup2
CARE SERVICES TO SURVEY.

01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:14.729 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL ENROLLEES.

01:32:13.495 --> 01:32:16.698 region:rollup2
AND.

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:21.136 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP DOSH FORCE TO BETTER

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:22.370 region:rollup2
MONITOR ACCESS TO CARE.

01:32:21.136 --> 01:32:23.738 region:rollup2
A LOT FOR MY PRESENTATION TODAY

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:24.572 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE A

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:25.807 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK.

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:27.509 region:rollup2
FOR HOW WE THINK ABOUT.

01:32:25.807 --> 01:32:28.943 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE FOR.

01:32:27.509 --> 01:32:30.678 region:rollup2
FOR ANYBODY REALLY BUT LOW

01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:31.813 region:rollup2
INCOME POPULATIONS. AND THEN I'M

01:32:30.678 --> 01:32:33.248 region:rollup2
GONNA SHARE SOME FINDINGS FROM

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:33.915 region:rollup2
OUR RESEARCH AND RESEARCH DONE

01:32:33.248 --> 01:32:36.251 region:rollup2
BY OTHERS.

01:32:33.915 --> 01:32:37.919 region:rollup2
AND FOCUS ON NON ELDERLY ADULTS

01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:39.954 region:rollup2
SINCE THEY ARE THE FOCUS OF OUR

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:43.358 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR COVERAGE

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:44.592 region:rollup2
OF THE REMAINING UNINSURED. WHEN

01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:44.793 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA RESEARCH.

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:45.693 region:rollup2
AND.

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:47.028 region:rollup2
AND THEN FOCUS ON THE

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:49.097 region:rollup2
COMPARISON BETWEEN MEDI CAL.

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:49.998 region:rollup2
AND THE UNINSURED AND MEDICARE

01:32:49.097 --> 01:32:51.166 region:rollup2
I'LL AND.

01:32:49.998 --> 01:32:52.700 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET.

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:53.435 region:rollup2
.

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.436 region:rollup2
SINCE AGAIN.

01:32:53.435 --> 01:32:55.937 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THE CHOICES THAT

01:32:54.436 --> 01:32:57.906 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEFORE US.

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:59.174 region:rollup2
I WANNA DISCUSS IT BRIEFLY SOME

01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:00.742 region:rollup2
KEY PROGRAM FEATURES.

01:32:59.174 --> 01:33:01.709 region:rollup2
IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT I

01:33:00.742 --> 01:33:02.844 region:rollup2
THINK ARE IMPORTANT ADDRESSING

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:04.512 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE FOR ANY LOW

01:33:02.844 --> 01:33:06.181 region:rollup2
INCOME POPULATION.

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:07.415 region:rollup2
AND I BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE FOR.

01:33:06.181 --> 01:33:13.088 region:rollup2
PRESENTING SOME OPPORTUNITIES

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:14.556 region:rollup2
FOR IMPROVEMENT.

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.756 region:rollup2
SO AS WE THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT

01:33:14.556 --> 01:33:15.790 region:rollup2
WAYS.

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:16.758 region:rollup2
TO MEASURE.

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:18.993 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE.

01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:20.328 region:rollup2
WE WORKING WITH RESEARCHERS AT

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:21.796 region:rollup2
MATHEMATICA POLICY RESEARCH

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:23.965 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK.

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:24.999 region:rollup2
LOOKS AT THREE AREAS POTENTIAL

01:33:23.965 --> 01:33:26.601 region:rollup2
ACCESS ON WHERE THE

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:27.836 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR COVERAGE

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.104 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN OUR HEALTH CARE TO

01:33:27.836 --> 01:33:29.671 region:rollup2
LEASE THE RELEASE SYSTEM ARE

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:31.840 region:rollup2
THEY PROMOTING. A ACCESS TO

01:33:29.671 --> 01:33:34.075 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:36.478 region:rollup2
REALIZE ACCESS WITH THE ACTUAL

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:37.779 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE AND THEN

01:33:36.478 --> 01:33:39.614 region:rollup2
FINALLY HEALTH OUTCOMES.

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:40.682 region:rollup2
WHEN WE START AT THE TOP SOME

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:42.016 region:rollup2
OF THOSE ARE THE MOST THE

01:33:40.682 --> 01:33:43.284 region:rollup2
EASIEST MEASURES TO COLLECT

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:45.253 region:rollup2
THESE DATA TO COLLECT AND OFTEN

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:46.020 region:rollup2
THE MOST DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE

01:33:45.253 --> 01:33:48.022 region:rollup2
TO THE POLICY CHOICES THAT WE

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:48.857 region:rollup2
MAKE. AS WE WORK FARTHER DOWN

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:50.458 region:rollup2
THIS LIST.

01:33:48.857 --> 01:33:51.392 region:rollup2
YOU GET INTO A NUMBER OF

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.827 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITIES IN TERMS OF

01:33:51.392 --> 01:33:54.362 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTION BOTH TO THE POLICY

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:55.797 region:rollup2
DECISIONS AND ALSO.

01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:57.499 region:rollup2
THE COMPLEXITIES OF BOTH

01:33:55.797 --> 01:34:00.034 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENT AND THE DIFFERENCES

01:33:57.499 --> 01:34:00.034 region:rollup2
IN YEAH I DEFER POPULATIONS

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:05.406 region:rollup2
AND DISCUSS AND IT ON ALL THREE

01:34:01.903 --> 01:34:07.442 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS.

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:08.910 region:rollup2
BEFORE A GETTING STARTED IN

01:34:07.442 --> 01:34:11.813 region:rollup2
THIS CAME UP IN THAT.

01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:13.348 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND AND A QUESTIONS TO.

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:14.916 region:rollup2
TO LARRY LEVAN ABOUT.

01:34:13.348 --> 01:34:16.317 region:rollup2
MEDICARE POPULATIONS ANOTHER

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:18.820 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THERE ARE IMPORTANT

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:21.556 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN THE POPULATIONS

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:22.724 region:rollup2
ACROSS DIFFERENT COVERAGE TYPES.

01:34:21.556 --> 01:34:24.492 region:rollup2
AND NEEDS HAVE AS VERY

01:34:22.724 --> 01:34:26.261 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT LOCATIONS FOR WHAT WE

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:28.696 region:rollup2
SEE IN THE ACCESS DATA.

01:34:26.261 --> 01:34:30.298 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE COMPARE MEDI CAL.

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:31.499 region:rollup2
ENROLLEES TO THOSE WITH PRIVATE

01:34:30.298 --> 01:34:32.867 region:rollup2
COVERAGE WE COMPARE THEM TO THE

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:34.402 region:rollup2
ENSURE ITS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:35.703 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE NOT

01:34:34.402 --> 01:34:36.738 region:rollup2
COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES.

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:37.705 region:rollup2
AND.

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:39.274 region:rollup2
WE CAN DIED A LITTLE DEEPER

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:41.809 region:rollup2
INTO THAT.

01:34:39.274 --> 01:34:42.010 region:rollup2
ONE THER THING TO MENTION IS

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:43.945 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:45.180 region:rollup2
MIGHT IN MY PRESENTATION I AM

01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:46.548 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT CHILDREN

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:47.916 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PART PARTLY FOR THAT

01:34:46.548 --> 01:34:48.483 region:rollup2
REASON I MENTION BEFORE WHERE

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:49.484 region:rollup2
ARE THE REMAINING UNDERSHIRT

01:34:48.483 --> 01:34:51.186 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:34:49.484 --> 01:34:51.753 region:rollup2
PREDOMINANT DEALT IN FACT NINETY

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:52.887 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF CHILDREN HERE IN

01:34:51.753 --> 01:34:54.722 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:55.823 region:rollup2
ARE COVERED I THINK A LARGE

01:34:54.722 --> 01:34:57.692 region:rollup2
PART TO A NUMBER OF MEDI CAL

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:58.993 region:rollup2
EXPANSIONS. ON BUT WHAT I WOULD

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:59.527 region:rollup2
SAY ABOUT CHILDREN IS THAT THE

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:02.130 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:02.463 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SHOW THAT CHILDREN

01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:04.799 region:rollup2
AND MEDI CAL.

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:06.901 region:rollup2
THEIR EXPERIENCE OF ACCESS IS

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:08.369 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO CHILDREN WITH

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:09.337 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE.

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:11.139 region:rollup2
AND TENDS TO BE MUCH BETTER

01:35:09.337 --> 01:35:13.241 region:rollup2
THAN ADULT MEDI CAL ENROLLEES.

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:15.076 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SPECIAL PROTECTIONS FOR

01:35:13.241 --> 01:35:16.144 region:rollup2
CHILDREN INCLUDING THE EARLY AND

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:18.012 region:rollup2
PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:19.714 region:rollup2
TREATMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:20.615 region:rollup2
SPECIAL HIGHER PAYMENT RATES FOR

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:21.683 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY CARE AND THE

01:35:20.615 --> 01:35:22.850 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES

01:35:21.683 --> 01:35:24.185 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:25.954 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:26.454 region:rollup2
CONCEIVING FACTORS TO THE FACT

01:35:25.954 --> 01:35:28.122 region:rollup2
THAT CHILDREN.

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:30.325 region:rollup2
ENJOY BETTER ACCESS THAN.

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:31.593 region:rollup2
ADULTS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

01:35:30.325 --> 01:35:32.727 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

01:35:31.593 --> 01:35:34.629 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN.

01:35:32.727 --> 01:35:35.196 region:rollup2
AS SURPRISING RISE IN THE

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:36.531 region:rollup2
SHERIFF.

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:38.099 region:rollup2
PARENTS REPORTING DIFFICULTY

01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:39.634 region:rollup2
FINDING SPECIALISTS

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:42.303 region:rollup2
UP FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

01:35:39.634 --> 01:35:44.439 region:rollup2
WE ARE FORTUNATE D. H. YES IT'S

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:45.206 region:rollup2
CREATED A NEW DASHBOARD. TO

01:35:44.439 --> 01:35:46.240 region:rollup2
MONITOR CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:47.742 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.177 region:rollup2
IN IT SHOWS MIXED PICTURE

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:50.745 region:rollup2
STEADILY INCREASING UTILIZATION

01:35:49.177 --> 01:35:52.247 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:53.648 region:rollup2
BUT OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE

01:35:52.247 --> 01:35:55.750 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO AND USE OF DENTAL

01:35:53.648 --> 01:35:57.452 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND SOME DECLINES IN

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:58.753 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF CARE OVER TIME SO I

01:35:57.452 --> 01:35:59.954 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POPULATION BUT WON'T

01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:05.293 region:rollup2
BE THE FOCUS OF THE REMAINDER OF

01:35:59.954 --> 01:36:06.561 region:rollup2
MY PRESENTATION.

01:36:05.293 --> 01:36:07.462 region:rollup2
AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

01:36:06.561 --> 01:36:09.130 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION WE HAVE BEEN

01:36:07.462 --> 01:36:11.266 region:rollup2
FORTUNATE WORK WITHOUT DOCTORS

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:11.866 region:rollup2
ANY BY MEN AND DR AGENDA KAUFMAN

MEDICARE PROGRAM USING A.

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:23.344 region:rollup2
HE'S. DEAD AND WE END WITH THE

MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:26.514 region:rollup2
USING A SUPPLEMENTAL SURVEY THE

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:28.116 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS ARE ASKED TO COMPLETE

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:28.616 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY RENEW THEIR LICENSES

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:29.684 region:rollup2
AND IT GIVES US A UNIQUE

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:31.052 region:rollup2
INSIGHT.

01:36:29.684 --> 01:36:32.487 region:rollup2
INTO PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IN

01:36:31.052 --> 01:36:34.155 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM SOMETHING THAT

01:36:32.487 --> 01:36:37.091 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:37.725 region:rollup2
IN OTHER AT NATIONAL CAN

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:38.826 region:rollup2
BEATINGS OTHER STATES ARE REALLY

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:39.661 region:rollup2
QUITE JEALOUS OF.

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:41.529 region:rollup2
NOT WHAT WE FIND.

01:36:39.661 --> 01:36:43.498 region:rollup2
FROM THIS WORK IS THAT ABOUT

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:45.266 region:rollup2
SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF MEDI CAL

01:36:43.498 --> 01:36:46.367 region:rollup2
ISCHEMIA PHYSICIANS CALIFORNIA

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:48.036 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE MOAT AND AND

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:50.438 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PROGRAM AND SIXTY

01:36:48.036 --> 01:36:51.639 region:rollup2
PERCENT. ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS

01:36:50.438 --> 01:36:53.141 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S ARE

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:54.509 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT LOWER THAN IT IS FOR

01:36:53.141 --> 01:36:55.677 region:rollup2
OTHER FORMS OF INSURANCE AND

01:36:54.509 --> 01:36:57.111 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT ABOVE TO

01:36:55.677 --> 01:36:59.047 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN SERVING THE

01:36:57.111 --> 01:37:00.448 region:rollup2
UNINSURED.

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:01.716 region:rollup2
I DOCTOR COFFIN ENTER TEAM IN

01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:03.718 region:rollup2
THE LATEST SURVEY HAVE ALSO

01:37:01.716 --> 01:37:05.553 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT. THE RATIO OF

01:37:03.718 --> 01:37:07.288 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS.

01:37:05.553 --> 01:37:08.456 region:rollup2
TWO ENROLLEES

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:10.324 region:rollup2
IS.

01:37:08.456 --> 01:37:11.459 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IS

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:12.927 region:rollup2
BELOW NOT ONLY NATIONAL

01:37:11.459 --> 01:37:14.395 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES BUT ALSO THE

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:16.130 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT'S OWN STANDARDS FOR

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:17.131 region:rollup2
ITS MANAGED CARE PLANS.

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:18.666 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:19.667 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS TO SERVE THE MEDI CAL

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:22.670 region:rollup2
POPULATION ACCORDING TO THE

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:23.604 region:rollup2
STATE'S OWN STANDARDS.

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.239 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:27.208 region:rollup2
DISPOSITION SUFFER PORTED DATA.

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:29.043 region:rollup2
THAT IN SOME REPORTED DATA IN

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:30.345 region:rollup2
GENERAL HAS ITS LIMITATIONS ARE

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:31.646 region:rollup2
WE HAVE EXAMINED A NUMBER OF

01:37:30.345 --> 01:37:32.780 region:rollup2
OTHER WAYS TO TRACK POSITION

01:37:31.646 --> 01:37:34.148 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION THE PROGRAM

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.818 region:rollup2
INCLUDING FROM.

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:37.452 region:rollup2
I DRUG CLAIMS AND MEDICAL CLAIMS

01:37:36.818 --> 01:37:41.622 region:rollup2
AND FOUND THIS TO BE A SUPERIOR

01:37:37.452 --> 01:37:43.291 region:rollup2
METHOD.

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:44.425 region:rollup2
A FROM THE SAME SURVEY WE ASKED

01:37:43.291 --> 01:37:46.694 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:48.796 region:rollup2
WHY THEY DO NOT PARTICIPATE

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:49.731 region:rollup2
MORE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:51.566 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT THE NUMBER ONE

01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:52.834 region:rollup2
REASON? THAT PUBLIC TO NO ONE'S

01:37:51.566 --> 01:37:54.369 region:rollup2
SURPRISE HIS PAYMENT.

01:37:52.834 --> 01:37:55.737 region:rollup2
BUT THEY GET A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:37:54.369 --> 01:37:58.139 region:rollup2
REASONS AS WELL AND WHEN WE TALK

01:37:55.737 --> 01:37:59.440 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:00.508 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATING IN THE

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.043 region:rollup2
SAFETY NET ONE OF THE THINGS

01:38:00.508 --> 01:38:03.044 region:rollup2
THAT WE OFTEN HEAR IS A CONCERN

01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:04.712 region:rollup2
OF THEIRS PROTECTING AMONG

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:06.180 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. IS THE

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:08.015 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY THEY HAVE REFERRING

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:08.916 region:rollup2
PATIENTS TO SPECIALTY CARE.

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.951 region:rollup2
IT'S ESPECIALLY CARE IS A

01:38:08.916 --> 01:38:17.091 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CHALLENGE FOR MEDI

01:38:09.951 --> 01:38:18.192 region:rollup2
CAL ENROLLEES.

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:19.527 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BENEFITS WE HAVE IN

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:20.795 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS THE CALIFORNIA

01:38:19.527 --> 01:38:22.864 region:rollup2
HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY.

01:38:20.795 --> 01:38:24.966 region:rollup2
AS A GENERAL POPULATION SURVEY

01:38:22.864 --> 01:38:27.001 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED ANNUALLY AND.

01:38:24.966 --> 01:38:28.936 region:rollup2
IT ALLOWS US SOME VERY ROBUST.

01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:30.405 region:rollup2
COMPARISONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:31.639 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS INCLUDING MEDICAL

01:38:30.405 --> 01:38:32.840 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS KNOWS WHAT OTHER

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:34.142 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF COVERAGE.

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.144 region:rollup2
AND HERE A FEW SLIDES TO

01:38:34.142 --> 01:38:38.279 region:rollup2
COMPARE ACCESS TO CARE FOR MEDI

01:38:36.144 --> 01:38:39.480 region:rollup2
CAL ENROLLEES TO OTHER PAYERS

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:41.382 region:rollup2
AND WE SEE THAT ACCESS TO CARE

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:42.984 region:rollup2
FOR ADULTS MEDI CAL ENROLLEES.

01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:44.318 region:rollup2
IS GENERALLY COMPARABLE TO

01:38:42.984 --> 01:38:46.120 region:rollup2
ADULTS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:48.022 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER THAN

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.257 region:rollup2
THE UNINSURED.

01:38:48.022 --> 01:38:50.825 region:rollup2
ONE KNOW WHERE THE FINING

01:38:49.257 --> 01:38:52.326 region:rollup2
REFLECTED IN THAT CHART IN THE

01:38:50.825 --> 01:38:55.129 region:rollup2
UPPER LEFT IS THAT MEDI CAL

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:56.631 region:rollup2
ENROLLEES ARE. JUST AS LIKELY TO

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:57.698 region:rollup2
HAVE THE USUAL SOURCE OF CARE.

01:38:56.631 --> 01:38:59.200 region:rollup2
AS THOSE WITH COVERS TO THE

01:38:57.698 --> 01:39:00.635 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MARKET THE WHERE THEY

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.136 region:rollup2
GET THEIR CARE IS DIFFERENT AS

01:39:00.635 --> 01:39:04.138 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THE MAJORITY OF MEDI

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:05.206 region:rollup2
CAL ENROLLEES SAY THEY GET THEIR

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:07.675 region:rollup2
CARE FROM HELL CENTER CLINIC.

01:39:05.206 --> 01:39:09.644 region:rollup2
RIZZI MAJORITY OF THOSE IN THE

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:11.379 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MARKET GET THEIR CARE

01:39:09.644 --> 01:39:12.079 region:rollup2
CITY GET THEIR KAREN ADOPTERS

01:39:11.379 --> 01:39:13.548 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:14.449 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME

01:39:13.548 --> 01:39:15.883 region:rollup2
DATA THAT WE'VE.

01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:18.052 region:rollup2
HOW FROM MEDICARE MANAGED CARE

01:39:15.883 --> 01:39:19.587 region:rollup2
PLANS THAT SAY FORTY PERCENT OF

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:21.656 region:rollup2
THEIR MEMBERS?

01:39:19.587 --> 01:39:22.223 region:rollup2
GET THEIR CARE FROM FEDERALLY

01:39:21.656 --> 01:39:23.024 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS ARE

01:39:22.223 --> 01:39:24.892 region:rollup2
LOOKALIKES.

01:39:23.024 --> 01:39:26.727 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE NEW

01:39:24.892 --> 01:39:35.570 region:rollup2
NEWLY ENROLLED MEDI CAL MEMBERS.

01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:36.237 region:rollup2
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:38.439 region:rollup2
NOW USING.

01:39:36.237 --> 01:39:40.041 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH SURVEY

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:42.343 region:rollup2
AYE INTERVIEW DATA AGAIN.

01:39:40.041 --> 01:39:43.878 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:45.713 region:rollup2
TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF

01:39:43.878 --> 01:39:47.415 region:rollup2
THE ACCESS WE SEE THAT ADULTS.

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:49.917 region:rollup2
AND RELEASE ARE LESS LIKELY TO

01:39:47.415 --> 01:39:51.419 region:rollup2
FOR GARE FORIT FOR GO CARE. DUE

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:53.087 region:rollup2
TO COST.

01:39:51.419 --> 01:39:57.825 region:rollup2
BUT HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY

01:39:53.087 --> 01:39:59.827 region:rollup2
GETTING TIMELY CARE.

01:39:57.825 --> 01:40:01.295 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT SURVEY ASKED PEOPLE

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:03.297 region:rollup2
WHY WHETHER THEY FORGO CARE AND

01:40:01.295 --> 01:40:04.999 region:rollup2
WHY THEY FOR GEAR FORGO CARE AND

01:40:03.297 --> 01:40:05.600 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THAT OTHER REASONS

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:06.501 region:rollup2
ARE QUITE DIFFERENT AND WE'RE

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:11.439 region:rollup2
GONNA GET INTO THOSE.

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:12.507 region:rollup2
IN JUST A BIT.

01:40:11.439 --> 01:40:14.542 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS ISSUE OF

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:16.544 region:rollup2
TIMELY ACCESS IS FROM A STUDY

01:40:14.542 --> 01:40:17.745 region:rollup2
DONE IN SACRAMENTO BY DOCTOR

01:40:16.544 --> 01:40:19.146 region:rollup2
JOINED ON THE COUNTER TEAM UC

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:21.082 region:rollup2
DAVIS.

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:22.350 region:rollup2
USING A SECRET SHOPPER APPROACH

01:40:21.082 --> 01:40:24.685 region:rollup2
THEY CALL THE OFFICES OF

01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:26.487 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS LISTED IN MEDI CAL

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:28.823 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN PROVIDER DIRECTORIES

01:40:26.487 --> 01:40:30.591 region:rollup2
AS ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS.

01:40:28.823 --> 01:40:31.926 region:rollup2
THE BLUE BARS SHOW THE PERCENT

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:33.628 region:rollup2
OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAD ANY

01:40:31.926 --> 01:40:36.097 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT.

01:40:33.628 --> 01:40:37.598 region:rollup2
OFFER A NEW PATIENT.

01:40:36.097 --> 01:40:39.133 region:rollup2
IN SOME COUNTIES ONE HALF OF

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:40.635 region:rollup2
THOSE CONTACTED SAID THEY HAD AN

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:42.136 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT WELL IN

01:40:40.635 --> 01:40:43.804 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS AS FEW AS ONE IN

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:45.439 region:rollup2
FOUR PHYSICIANS. HAD AN

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:47.108 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE PLANE AGAIN ONLY

01:40:45.439 --> 01:40:48.409 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS WHO SAID THEY WERE

01:40:47.108 --> 01:40:50.811 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS WERE

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:51.946 region:rollup2
CONTACTED AS PART OF THE STUDY.

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:53.915 region:rollup2
THE ORANGE BAR SHOWS WHAT

01:40:51.946 --> 01:40:55.316 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHEN THOSE SAME POSITION

01:40:53.915 --> 01:40:56.717 region:rollup2
OFFICES WERE ASKED WHETHER. THEY

01:40:55.316 --> 01:40:58.452 region:rollup2
HAD ANY APPOINTMENT WITHIN TEN

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.953 region:rollup2
DAYS.

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:00.221 region:rollup2
WITH ANY PROVIDER IN THE

01:40:58.953 --> 01:41:01.355 region:rollup2
PRACTICE

01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:02.290 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST QUESTION WAS JUST

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:03.491 region:rollup2
ASKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:04.225 region:rollup2
PROVIDED IT WAS JUST IN THE

01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:05.927 region:rollup2
PROVIDER DIRECTORS ACCEPTING

01:41:04.225 --> 01:41:07.728 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THE SECOND QUESTION

01:41:05.927 --> 01:41:09.063 region:rollup2
SAYING. ANY PROVIDING A PRACTICE

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:10.264 region:rollup2
CAN I GET IN WITHIN TEN DAYS

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:11.933 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:13.134 region:rollup2
STATE STANDARD FOR PRIMARY CARE.

01:41:11.933 --> 01:41:14.602 region:rollup2
IN MOST CASES THE VALUE DROPS

01:41:13.134 --> 01:41:16.637 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY INDICATING THE

01:41:14.602 --> 01:41:18.039 region:rollup2
POSITIONS CANNOT MEET THIS I

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:19.607 region:rollup2
NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER.

01:41:18.039 --> 01:41:21.909 region:rollup2
AND ONE COUNTY YOU BUT THAT THAT

01:41:19.607 --> 01:41:23.544 region:rollup2
PERCENT ACTUALLY RISES. A THIS

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:24.879 region:rollup2
REFLECTS THAT IN SOME CASES.

01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:25.980 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THE ORIGINAL

01:41:24.879 --> 01:41:27.081 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN MAY NOT HAVE AN

01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:27.848 region:rollup2
INVALID VALVE APPOINTMENT

01:41:27.081 --> 01:41:33.754 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PHYSICIAN TO PRACTICE.

01:41:27.848 --> 01:41:35.489 region:rollup2
DOES.

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:36.891 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM USE IS CERTAINLY

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:38.993 region:rollup2
A HOT TOPIC IN MEDI CAL.

01:41:36.891 --> 01:41:40.494 region:rollup2
ONE THAT PEOPLE PLAY CLOSE

01:41:38.993 --> 01:41:41.529 region:rollup2
SCRUTINY TO AND PART BECAUSE IT

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:41.996 region:rollup2
CAN OFTEN BE A SIGNAL OF POOR

01:41:41.529 --> 01:41:43.397 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND.

01:41:41.996 --> 01:41:44.932 region:rollup2
AND ALL AND ALSO BECAUSE OF ITS

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:46.200 region:rollup2
HIGH COST.

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:47.568 region:rollup2
NOT THESE FIGURES SHOWN ON THIS

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.869 region:rollup2
PAGE REFLECT THE PERCENT OF

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:51.405 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BY COVERS TYPE THAT

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:53.641 region:rollup2
VISITED D. E. D.. AT LEAST ONCE

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:54.609 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST YEAR. AND AS YOU CAN

01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:56.043 region:rollup2
SEE MEDI CAL ENROLLEES RECEIVED

01:41:54.609 --> 01:41:58.512 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:59.614 region:rollup2
VISIT THE E. D. THAN THOSE WHAT

01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:01.282 region:rollup2
OTHER SOURCES OF COVERAGE.

01:41:59.614 --> 01:42:02.683 region:rollup2
AND ALSO MORE LIKELY THAN THE

01:42:01.282 --> 01:42:05.353 region:rollup2
UNINSURED WHO OFTEN AVOID ANY

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:06.620 region:rollup2
TYPE OF COSTLY CARE.

01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:07.955 region:rollup2
A CLOSER LOOK AT THE AD THAT TO

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:09.123 region:rollup2
DATE HOWEVER REVEAL THAT THESE

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:10.958 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES ARE LARGELY A

01:42:09.123 --> 01:42:12.526 region:rollup2
REFLECTION OF DIFFERENCES IN THE

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:13.928 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:15.529 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT JUST THOSE

01:42:13.928 --> 01:42:16.764 region:rollup2
UNFAIR POOR HEALTH WE SEE THAT

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:18.165 region:rollup2
GAP BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND THESE

01:42:16.764 --> 01:42:20.835 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:23.237 region:rollup2
PAYERS SHRINK AND WE CONTROL

01:42:20.835 --> 01:42:24.171 region:rollup2
FOR BOTH. A HEALTH STATUS IN

01:42:23.237 --> 01:42:25.773 region:rollup2
DISABILITY WE SEE THE GAP.

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:27.174 region:rollup2
.

01:42:25.773 --> 01:42:28.909 region:rollup2
SHRINK EVEN FURTHER SO

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:30.411 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THE DIFFERENCES THAT

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:32.246 region:rollup2
WE SEE IN ACCESS ARE NOT SO MUCH

01:42:30.411 --> 01:42:33.614 region:rollup2
A FUNCTION OF THE PROGRAM BUT OF

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:34.715 region:rollup2
THE POPULATIONS THEY SERVE IN

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:41.522 region:rollup2
THE VARIETY OF CHALLENGES THEY

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:43.157 region:rollup2
FACE IN THEIR LIVES.

01:42:41.522 --> 01:42:44.258 region:rollup2
I DECIDED CHARTS.

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:45.926 region:rollup2
WHICH LOOKS AT JUST THE MEDICAL

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:47.895 region:rollup2
POPULATION TOUCHES ON A SIMILAR

01:42:45.926 --> 01:42:49.296 region:rollup2
ISSUE. YOU CAN SEE THAT AMONG

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:50.398 region:rollup2
THE MEDICARE POPULATION WITHIN

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:51.899 region:rollup2
THE MEDICAL PROPOSITION THERE A

01:42:50.398 --> 01:42:52.767 region:rollup2
WIDE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:55.002 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES GETTING ACCESS TO

01:42:52.767 --> 01:42:55.536 region:rollup2
CARE. THIS IS NO BY NO MEANS A

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:56.470 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THIS

01:42:55.536 --> 01:42:58.839 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:42:56.470 --> 01:43:01.142 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THAT.

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:02.109 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROGRAM IS SERVING

01:43:01.142 --> 01:43:02.610 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENROLLEES IN DIFFERENT

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:04.211 region:rollup2
WAYS.

01:43:02.610 --> 01:43:06.013 region:rollup2
BOTH IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:11.118 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS AND AND ALSO

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:12.987 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICALLY.

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:14.155 region:rollup2
SINCE NINETY PERCENT MEDI CAL.

01:43:12.987 --> 01:43:15.256 region:rollup2
AND RELEASE ARE NOW SERVE TO

01:43:14.155 --> 01:43:16.023 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM I THOUGHT

01:43:15.256 --> 01:43:18.025 region:rollup2
TO BE INTERESTING SPENT LITTLE

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:19.560 region:rollup2
TIME ON USELESS AND LITTLE TIME

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:21.062 region:rollup2
ON THE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM. OF

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.196 region:rollup2
THIS FIRST SLIDE COMES FROM THE

01:43:21.062 --> 01:43:23.664 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES'

01:43:22.196 --> 01:43:25.199 region:rollup2
OWN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:27.134 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD. THOUGHT

01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:28.703 region:rollup2
AND IT SHOWS THE TREMENDOUS

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:29.837 region:rollup2
VARIATION IN PERFORMANCE.

01:43:28.703 --> 01:43:31.906 region:rollup2
ACROSS MANAGED CARE PLANS IN

01:43:29.837 --> 01:43:33.874 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL.

01:43:31.906 --> 01:43:35.910 region:rollup2
THAT THE NAMES OF THE PLANS ARE

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:37.378 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TOO SMALL TO SEE BUT I

01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:38.546 region:rollup2
HOPE THE MAJOR POINT ISN'T LOST.

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:40.247 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS THIS TREMENDOUS

01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:41.315 region:rollup2
VARIATION.

01:43:40.247 --> 01:43:43.184 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:45.386 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SEE ERE IS THAT THERE

01:43:43.184 --> 01:43:46.253 region:rollup2
ARE SOME PLANS FOR WHOM THAT ARE

01:43:45.386 --> 01:43:48.155 region:rollup2
PROVIDING EXCELLENT QUALITY OF

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:49.490 region:rollup2
CARE? ENOUGH ALL MEDI CAL

01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:51.292 region:rollup2
ENROLLEES WERE IN PLANS A

01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:52.226 region:rollup2
PROVIDED THAT LEVEL OF QUALITY

01:43:51.292 --> 01:43:54.295 region:rollup2
AND ACCESS.

01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:56.664 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE A MUCH GREATER

01:43:54.295 --> 01:44:00.935 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE

01:43:56.664 --> 01:44:02.503 region:rollup2
CARE FOR ALL MEDICAL ENROLLEES.

01:44:00.935 --> 01:44:03.504 region:rollup2
AGAIN LOOKING AT THE MEDI CAL

01:44:02.503 --> 01:44:05.372 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM.

01:44:03.504 --> 01:44:06.540 region:rollup2
.

01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:07.675 region:rollup2
MEMBER WALDRON.

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:10.744 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO.

01:44:07.675 --> 01:44:12.513 region:rollup2
THE HE JUST A DATA SET QUALITY

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:12.747 region:rollup2
AYE DATA.

01:44:12.513 --> 01:44:13.314 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:15.149 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL

01:44:13.314 --> 01:44:17.118 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE.

01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:17.685 region:rollup2
AND THIS LOOKS AT SIX OF THE

01:44:17.118 --> 01:44:19.420 region:rollup2
MEASURES THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:44:17.685 --> 01:44:20.621 region:rollup2
HAS.

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:22.223 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO USE IN WHAT'S CALLED

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:23.023 region:rollup2
ITS AUTO ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

01:44:22.223 --> 01:44:23.958 region:rollup2
THIS AS AN OUT OF THIS IS AYE

01:44:23.023 --> 01:44:26.127 region:rollup2
AYE METHOD BY WHICH THE

01:44:23.958 --> 01:44:26.627 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. TAKES IN RELEASE YOU

01:44:26.127 --> 01:44:27.328 region:rollup2
DON'T USE A HEALTH PLAN

01:44:26.627 --> 01:44:30.664 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:44:27.328 --> 01:44:32.233 region:rollup2
AND USES TO ASSIGN THOSE

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:33.701 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES TO A HEALTH PLAN

01:44:32.233 --> 01:44:35.569 region:rollup2
WHAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS IS THAT

01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:36.737 region:rollup2
HE'S OF THE SIX MEASURES THAT D.

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:38.506 region:rollup2
H. YES WITH THAT STAKEHOLDERS

01:44:36.737 --> 01:44:39.907 region:rollup2
THAT IS A REALLY KEY MEASURES

01:44:38.506 --> 01:44:42.143 region:rollup2
FOR US IN TERMS OF MEASURING

01:44:39.907 --> 01:44:43.177 region:rollup2
QUALITY SITE AYE AMONG THE MANY

01:44:42.143 --> 01:44:43.811 region:rollup2
MEASURES THAT WE COULD LOOK AT.

01:44:43.177 --> 01:44:45.312 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY.

01:44:43.811 --> 01:44:47.381 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING AT THE SIX HERE

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:48.449 region:rollup2
TODAY. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS

01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:51.152 region:rollup2
THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE AND

01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:51.652 region:rollup2
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE IS SIMILAR

01:44:51.152 --> 01:44:52.586 region:rollup2
TO THE NATIONAL MEDICAID

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:54.655 region:rollup2
AVERAGE.

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:56.824 region:rollup2
BUT NOT IMPROVING.

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:57.224 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF OF WAYS

01:44:56.824 --> 01:44:59.393 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THIS.

01:44:57.224 --> 01:45:01.028 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE ON THE ONE HAND WE

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:02.463 region:rollup2
WOULD HOPE TO SEE CONTINUOUS

01:45:01.028 --> 01:45:03.898 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROGRAM OVER

01:45:02.463 --> 01:45:05.766 region:rollup2
TIME IN MANAGED CARE.

01:45:03.898 --> 01:45:07.401 region:rollup2
THAT IS A LARGELY A CHARGE OF

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:09.103 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM. ARE ON THE OTHER

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:10.905 region:rollup2
HAND GIVEN THE RAPID GROWTH IN

01:45:09.103 --> 01:45:11.839 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM. AT IN THE LAST FEW

01:45:10.905 --> 01:45:13.741 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:45:11.839 --> 01:45:14.809 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE SOME SMALL COMFORT

01:45:13.741 --> 01:45:16.577 region:rollup2
COMFORT THERE HASN'T BEEN A

01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:17.845 region:rollup2
SERIOUS DECLINING QUALITY THERE

01:45:16.577 --> 01:45:19.280 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY BEEN CALLS AND

01:45:17.845 --> 01:45:20.848 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT.

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.782 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAMS NATIONALLY CAN

01:45:20.848 --> 01:45:23.350 region:rollup2
HANDLE BOTH THE TRADITIONAL

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:24.752 region:rollup2
MEDICAID POPULATION EXPANDED

01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:26.587 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND THE STATE IT

01:45:24.752 --> 01:45:27.755 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE QUALITY

01:45:26.587 --> 01:45:29.123 region:rollup2
OF CARE HAS NOT DETERIORATED FOR

01:45:27.755 --> 01:45:32.693 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL DURING THIS PERIOD BY

01:45:29.123 --> 01:45:33.861 region:rollup2
MARCH.

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:36.363 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO ALSO MENTION THE

01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:37.965 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PLANS PLAY A VERY UNIQUE

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:39.667 region:rollup2
ROLE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. A

01:45:37.965 --> 01:45:40.534 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THE EIGHT REPRESENT

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:42.536 region:rollup2
THE THREE.

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:42.736 region:rollup2
BLUE R. BLUISH LIKE SEGMENTS OF

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:45.206 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:46.874 region:rollup2
THIS CHART HERE SO THEY ACCOUNT

01:45:45.206 --> 01:45:48.576 region:rollup2
FOR MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS.

01:45:46.874 --> 01:45:49.743 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT WHEN WE

01:45:48.576 --> 01:45:51.212 region:rollup2
COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

01:45:49.743 --> 01:45:52.246 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PLANS TO THE COMMERCIAL

01:45:51.212 --> 01:45:53.781 region:rollup2
PLANS PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE

01:45:52.246 --> 01:45:55.249 region:rollup2
I'LL. IN THOSE COUNTIES.

01:45:53.781 --> 01:45:57.284 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE ARE BOTH KINDS OF

01:45:55.249 --> 01:45:59.253 region:rollup2
PLANS I GENERALLY THE PUBLIC

01:45:57.284 --> 01:46:00.821 region:rollup2
PLANS PERFORM BETTER AND WHEN WE

01:45:59.253 --> 01:46:02.056 region:rollup2
HAVE LOOKED TO SEE WHAT

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:03.490 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS?

01:46:02.056 --> 01:46:04.892 region:rollup2
A HEALTH PLANS ARE MAKING IN

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:06.627 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE

01:46:04.892 --> 01:46:08.028 region:rollup2
THEIR DELIVERY SYSTEMS GENERALLY

01:46:06.627 --> 01:46:10.397 region:rollup2
WHAT SERVICES IS A LARGE

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:11.832 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS BY PUBLIC PLANS THIS

01:46:10.397 --> 01:46:14.401 region:rollup2
IS NOT UNIVERSALLY TRUE.

01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:15.536 region:rollup2
SOME PLANS ARE TAKING A MORE

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:16.971 region:rollup2
ACTIVE ROLE THAN OTHER BUT

01:46:15.536 --> 01:46:18.606 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S FAIR TO

01:46:16.971 --> 01:46:20.507 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THE PUBLIC PLANS ARE

01:46:18.606 --> 01:46:21.041 region:rollup2
ARE TAKING A DEEPER AND LONGER

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:24.144 region:rollup2
TERM INVESTMENTS IN THEIR

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:24.979 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:26.313 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO MENTION SEVERAL

01:46:24.979 --> 01:46:27.314 region:rollup2
FEATURES OF MEDI CAL THAT ARE

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:28.983 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO PROMOTE BETTER

01:46:27.314 --> 01:46:31.151 region:rollup2
ACCESS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS

01:46:28.983 --> 01:46:32.620 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CONSIDERING. ANY TYPES

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:34.922 region:rollup2
OF COVERAGE OPTIONS THAT YOU

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.956 region:rollup2
GIVE TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS.

01:46:34.922 --> 01:46:37.391 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT MEDICAID IS A

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:39.360 region:rollup2
VERY EXPANSIVE BENEFIT.

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:41.262 region:rollup2
INCLUDING DENTAL COVERAGE AND

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:43.130 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION SERVICES.

01:46:41.262 --> 01:46:44.899 region:rollup2
THAT HAS NO OR LOW PREMIUMS AND

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:46.400 region:rollup2
COST SHARING.

01:46:44.899 --> 01:46:47.835 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NUMEROUS LEGAL AND

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:49.436 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE PROTECTIONS FOR

01:46:47.835 --> 01:46:51.071 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL ENROLLEES I MENTIONED

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:52.306 region:rollup2
THE EPT AT EP STT REQUIREMENTS

01:46:51.071 --> 01:46:53.774 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:46:52.306 --> 01:46:55.809 region:rollup2
THERE ARE HIGHER PAYMENTS FOR

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:56.810 region:rollup2
SELECTED PROVIDERS.

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:58.712 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S

01:46:56.810 --> 01:47:00.447 region:rollup2
SERVICES FOR ATHLETIC QUALIFIED

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:01.749 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTERS FOR EXAMPLE. AND

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:03.450 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S UNIQUE ENROLLMENT

01:47:01.749 --> 01:47:04.818 region:rollup2
OPTIONS SO THERE'S YEAR ROUND

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:06.120 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IN MEDI CAL.

01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:07.354 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:08.722 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE ON THE INDIVIDUAL

01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:15.596 region:rollup2
MARKET OR THROUGH EMPLOYER

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:16.597 region:rollup2
SPONSORED INSURANCE.

01:47:15.596 --> 01:47:18.299 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THE

01:47:16.597 --> 01:47:19.466 region:rollup2
MOST MEDI CAL ENROLLEES HAVE A

01:47:18.299 --> 01:47:21.201 region:rollup2
POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:22.603 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO DESPITE. MANY OF THE

01:47:21.201 --> 01:47:23.737 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WHEN YOU ASK

01:47:22.603 --> 01:47:25.940 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES ABOUT THEIR

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:26.840 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE. IN GENERAL THEY SAY

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.275 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.444 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU ASK THEM ABOUT THE

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:32.279 region:rollup2
PERCEPTION THAT IT CAL MOST SAY

01:47:30.444 --> 01:47:33.847 region:rollup2
IT'S EITHER A VERY GOOD PROGRAM.

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:35.049 region:rollup2
OR PRETTY GOOD PROGRAM.

01:47:33.847 --> 01:47:36.483 region:rollup2
NOW THIS WAS A SURVEY THAT WAS

01:47:35.049 --> 01:47:37.651 region:rollup2
DONE BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:38.719 region:rollup2
ACT WAS ENACTED BEFORE THE

01:47:37.651 --> 01:47:40.187 region:rollup2
EXPANSION.

01:47:38.719 --> 01:47:41.655 region:rollup2
WE DID THIS SURVEY IN

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:43.123 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:45.326 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE WOULD.

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:46.727 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:47:45.326 --> 01:47:48.062 region:rollup2
DO IT AGAIN I'D LOVE TO PARTNER

01:47:46.727 --> 01:47:50.130 region:rollup2
WITH THEM TO DO THAT.

01:47:48.062 --> 01:47:51.665 region:rollup2
BUT SO FAR HAVE NOT HAD THE

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:52.766 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:54.401 region:rollup2
BUT DISS.

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:55.970 region:rollup2
WAS A STATE WAS A STATE OF THE

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:57.137 region:rollup2
ART SURVEY THAT LOOKED ACROSS A

01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:59.073 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE SURVEY DATA AND THAT

01:47:57.137 --> 01:48:00.174 region:rollup2
IT CAL AND RELEASE FOCUSES ONLY

01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:01.909 region:rollup2
ON THE MANAGED CARE POPULATION

01:48:00.174 --> 01:48:03.077 region:rollup2
IN THIS LOOKED AT BOTH A MEDIC.

01:48:01.909 --> 01:48:04.645 region:rollup2
THE MANAGED CARE AND THAT AND

01:48:03.077 --> 01:48:05.980 region:rollup2
THE FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION

01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:06.947 region:rollup2
WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE

01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.748 region:rollup2
FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:09.750 region:rollup2
INCLUDES.

01:48:07.748 --> 01:48:11.985 region:rollup2
A LOT OF SENIORS PEOPLE

01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:15.255 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES WHO REQUEST TO

01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:16.957 region:rollup2
RECEIVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS.

01:48:15.255 --> 01:48:17.491 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS JUST A SUMMARY OF THE

01:48:16.957 --> 01:48:19.360 region:rollup2
FINDINGS.

01:48:17.491 --> 01:48:20.761 region:rollup2
IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:21.995 region:rollup2
REPEAT THEM HERE.

01:48:20.761 --> 01:48:24.064 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:25.733 region:rollup2
I WILL ADD THAT WHILE MEDI CAL

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:27.001 region:rollup2
DOES FACE SOME BIG CHALLENGES

01:48:25.733 --> 01:48:28.469 region:rollup2
AND MEDICAL AND RELEASE ARE

01:48:27.001 --> 01:48:30.838 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER OFF.

01:48:28.469 --> 01:48:32.306 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM.

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:34.308 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WANTED TO LEAVE WITH

01:48:32.306 --> 01:48:35.642 region:rollup2
SOME IDEAS FOR IMPROVING ACCESS.

01:48:34.308 --> 01:48:36.477 region:rollup2
.

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:38.112 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT THERE'S

01:48:36.477 --> 01:48:40.047 region:rollup2
CLEARLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:48:38.112 --> 01:48:42.649 region:rollup2
IMPROVE HEALTH PLAN PERFORMANCE

01:48:40.047 --> 01:48:43.917 region:rollup2
AND ONE SIMPLE IDEA. IS TO THAT

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:45.552 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE GREAT IMPACT IS TO

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:47.388 region:rollup2
PAY THEM DIFFERENTLY.

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:49.790 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE EXAMPLE JUST AS MANY

01:48:47.388 --> 01:48:51.125 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL HEALTH PLANS.

01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:52.826 region:rollup2
PAY THEIR PROVIDERS WITH A PAY

01:48:51.125 --> 01:48:54.528 region:rollup2
FOR PERFORMANCE BONUS AND WE

01:48:52.826 --> 01:48:55.829 region:rollup2
COULD DO THE SAME IN THE STATE

01:48:54.528 --> 01:48:57.564 region:rollup2
PAYING HEALTH PLANS MORE THAT

01:48:55.829 --> 01:48:58.999 region:rollup2
ARE IMPROVING. QUALITY AND

01:48:57.564 --> 01:49:00.534 region:rollup2
ACCESS

01:48:58.999 --> 01:49:02.970 region:rollup2
PERFORMING BETTER AND PAYING

01:49:00.534 --> 01:49:04.705 region:rollup2
THOSE LAST THE DOWN.

01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:06.707 region:rollup2
A SECOND IS TO ENCOURAGE PLANS

01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:07.741 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH.

01:49:06.707 --> 01:49:09.843 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:10.544 region:rollup2
IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:12.046 region:rollup2
HAVE USE ELECTRONIC

01:49:10.544 --> 01:49:13.280 region:rollup2
CONSULTATIONS AND REFERRAL

01:49:12.046 --> 01:49:15.949 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WITH GREAT IMPACT.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:17.451 region:rollup2
REDUCING UNNECESSARY SERVICES

01:49:15.949 --> 01:49:18.585 region:rollup2
AND VISITS TO SPECIALISTS THAT

01:49:17.451 --> 01:49:20.754 region:rollup2
COULD BE AVOIDED.

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:22.790 region:rollup2
AND CUTTING OFFMONTHS OF

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:24.091 region:rollup2
WAITING TIMES FOR THOSE THAT

01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:25.559 region:rollup2
NEEDED SPECIALTY CARE.

01:49:24.091 --> 01:49:27.361 region:rollup2
SIMILARLY LIVE VIDEO AND STORED

01:49:25.559 --> 01:49:29.596 region:rollup2

01:49:27.361 --> 01:49:31.765 region:rollup2
BOTH RURAL AND URBAN. PIPED UP

01:49:29.596 --> 01:49:34.401 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WITHOUT SPECIALISTS.

01:49:31.765 --> 01:49:36.570 region:rollup2
AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO THOSE

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:37.304 region:rollup2
AREAS ARGUABLY ANY PLANET

01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:39.206 region:rollup2
SERVING AND.

RURAL POPULATION OR RECEIVING

01:49:39.206 --> 01:49:42.976 region:rollup2
AN EXEMPTION FROM THE NETWORK

01:49:41.475 --> 01:49:43.610 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY A TIMELY ACCESS GENDER

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:45.446 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE A ROBUST TELEHEALTH

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:47.648 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS

01:49:45.446 --> 01:49:48.449 region:rollup2
OF THEIR ENROLLEES.

01:49:47.648 --> 01:49:49.783 region:rollup2
A THIRD THROUGH.

01:49:48.449 --> 01:49:51.685 region:rollup2
ITS WAIVER THE MEDICAL PROGRAM

01:49:49.783 --> 01:49:52.219 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN INVESTING BILLIONS IN

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:53.353 region:rollup2
THE TRANSFORMATION OF CARE

01:49:52.219 --> 01:49:55.322 region:rollup2

DONE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF E.

01:52:56.803 --> 01:53:01.308 region:rollup2
BE.

01:52:59.706 --> 01:53:02.309 region:rollup2
UP FIFTEEN EIGHTY SIX.

01:53:01.308 --> 01:53:04.311 region:rollup2
A BILL YOUR PREDECESSORS

01:53:02.309 --> 01:53:05.245 region:rollup2
APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND

01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:07.414 region:rollup2
AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:08.982 region:rollup2
TO WHEN WE PRESENT. OUGHT TO

01:53:07.414 --> 01:53:10.417 region:rollup2
NATIONAL AUDIENCES FOLKS ARE

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:12.419 region:rollup2
IMPRESSED AT THE ARRAY OF DATA

01:53:10.417 --> 01:53:13.787 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE ON PHYSICIANS IN

01:53:12.419 --> 01:53:15.322 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND AND I THINK IN

01:53:13.787 --> 01:53:17.991 region:rollup2
FACT IN SOME OTHER PROFESSIONS

01:53:15.322 --> 01:53:19.493 region:rollup2
FOLKS. WISH WE HAD ANYTHING

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:20.794 region:rollup2
WHERE NEAR THE DATA NO NURSING

01:53:19.493 --> 01:53:21.695 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AND I THINK THE ONLY

01:53:20.794 --> 01:53:24.164 region:rollup2
PROFESSION WERE QUITE.

01:53:21.695 --> 01:53:26.633 region:rollup2
SAME LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA.

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:28.835 region:rollup2
I'VE SO POSITION WORKFORCE OF

01:53:26.633 --> 01:53:30.504 region:rollup2
FIVE ARE A KEY FINDING SPIKE KEY

01:53:28.835 --> 01:53:32.372 region:rollup2
THINGS TO REMEMBER.

01:53:30.504 --> 01:53:34.107 region:rollup2
UP ONLY FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:36.410 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA WHO

01:53:34.107 --> 01:53:38.178 region:rollup2
HAVE A CALIFORNIA LICENSE

01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:40.147 region:rollup2
PROVIDE PATIENT CARE.

01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:41.181 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE TO BE

01:53:40.147 --> 01:53:43.316 region:rollup2
REALLY CAREFUL WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:45.018 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF LICENSEES.

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:46.820 region:rollup2
IT'S AN OVERSTATEMENT ABOUT ONE

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:48.755 region:rollup2
THIRD OF OUR PHYSICIANS ARE

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:51.591 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND TWO

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:52.959 region:rollup2
THIRDS ARE SPECIALISTS AND WHILE

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:53.827 region:rollup2
THERE MULTIPLE WAYS TO DEFINE

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:55.962 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE.

01:53:53.827 --> 01:53:58.165 region:rollup2
OUR TEAM DEFINES IT ADDS FAMILY

01:53:55.962 --> 01:54:00.834 region:rollup2
MEDICINE GENERAL INTERNIST

01:53:58.165 --> 01:54:01.401 region:rollup2
GENERAL PEDIATRICIANS AND DIED

01:54:00.834 --> 01:54:02.402 region:rollup2
GENERAL PRACTICE AND THAT'S

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:03.737 region:rollup2
PRETTY WIDELY ACCEPTED

01:54:02.402 --> 01:54:06.340 region:rollup2
DEFINITION.

01:54:03.737 --> 01:54:07.240 region:rollup2
POINT THREE GEOGRAPHIC

01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.775 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION OF PHYSICIANS

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:09.643 region:rollup2
ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS HIGHLY

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:11.144 region:rollup2
UNEVEN WILL SAY WILL MORE ABOUT

01:54:09.643 --> 01:54:13.914 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:14.848 region:rollup2
FOURTH OUR PHYSICIANS DO NOT

01:54:13.914 --> 01:54:17.317 region:rollup2
REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR

01:54:14.848 --> 01:54:19.086 region:rollup2
POPULATION. AND FIFTH MANY

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:20.821 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS ARE LIKELY TO RETIRE

01:54:19.086 --> 01:54:22.889 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE DECADE THE NEXT

01:54:20.821 --> 01:54:24.791 region:rollup2
DECADE PARTICULARLY. IN RURAL

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:26.159 region:rollup2
AREA SO THERE IS A SILVER

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:28.061 region:rollup2
TSUNAMI IN THE GENERAL

01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:30.230 region:rollup2
POPULATION ISN'T MEMBER WALDRON

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:32.299 region:rollup2
ALLUDED TO BUT THERE'S ALSO SO

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:34.101 region:rollup2
PERSON ARMY AMONG PHYSICIANS.

01:54:32.299 --> 01:54:36.670 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS JUST TO REINFORCE

01:54:34.101 --> 01:54:37.871 region:rollup2
THE POINT I MADE A ABOUT THE

01:54:36.670 --> 01:54:39.239 region:rollup2
NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT MANY

01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:41.108 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS WERE LICENSED TO

01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:42.309 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. DON'T

01:54:41.108 --> 01:54:43.710 region:rollup2
PROVIDE PATIENT CARE IN THE

01:54:42.309 --> 01:54:44.911 region:rollup2
STATE SOME OF THE MAINTAIN THEIR

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:46.213 region:rollup2
LICENSE BUT THEIR NORMAL BUT THE

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:46.847 region:rollup2
RETIRED THEY THEY WANT TO HOLD

01:54:46.213 --> 01:54:48.648 region:rollup2
ON TO THE LICENSE THE MONEY TO

01:54:46.847 --> 01:54:50.751 region:rollup2
WILL VOLUNTEER WORK. BUT THEY'RE

01:54:48.648 --> 01:54:52.386 region:rollup2
NOT ACTIVELY PRACTICING OTHERS.

01:54:50.751 --> 01:54:53.587 region:rollup2
.

01:54:52.386 --> 01:54:54.421 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN OTHER STATES BUT

01:54:53.587 --> 01:54:56.123 region:rollup2
THEY ONE HOLD ON TO THE

01:54:54.421 --> 01:54:57.958 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LICENSE.

01:54:56.123 --> 01:54:59.192 region:rollup2
SUMMER STILL IN TRAINING THEY

01:54:57.958 --> 01:55:00.427 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T COMPLETED THAT RESIDENCY

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:01.795 region:rollup2
YET AND SO THEY HAVE A LICENSE

01:55:00.427 --> 01:55:02.796 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE NOT.

01:55:01.795 --> 01:55:04.431 region:rollup2
A FULL MEMBER OF THE WORK FORCE

01:55:02.796 --> 01:55:06.266 region:rollup2
JUST YET.

01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:07.801 region:rollup2
I'M SO BASED ON RESPONSES TO THE

01:55:06.266 --> 01:55:09.736 region:rollup2
MANDATORY SURVEY WE ESTIMATE

01:55:07.801 --> 01:55:10.937 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ABOUT SEVENTY ONE.

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:12.706 region:rollup2
THOUSAND POSITIONS WITH THE

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:14.341 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LICENSE WHO PROVIDE

01:55:12.706 --> 01:55:16.042 region:rollup2
PATIENT CARE.

01:55:14.341 --> 01:55:17.577 region:rollup2
AND OF THOSE ABOUT SIXTY ONE

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:19.312 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PROVIDE PATIENT CARE

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:20.914 region:rollup2
TWENTY OR MORE HOURS PER WEEK

01:55:19.312 --> 01:55:22.616 region:rollup2
SORTS A REALLY BIG PART OF THEIR

01:55:20.914 --> 01:55:23.750 region:rollup2
WORK WEEK NORMAN IN ACADEMIA

01:55:22.616 --> 01:55:25.619 region:rollup2
WHERE I'M FROM WE'VE A LOT OF

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:28.121 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS. WHO DO PATIENT CARE

01:55:25.619 --> 01:55:29.923 region:rollup2
MAYBE ONE MAYBE TWO DAYS A WEEK

01:55:28.121 --> 01:55:32.225 region:rollup2
AND SPEND THE REST OF THEIR TIME

01:55:29.923 --> 01:55:33.927 region:rollup2
DOING RESEARCH AND TEACHING?

01:55:32.225 --> 01:55:35.896 region:rollup2
I AM SO THIS GRAPH.

01:55:33.927 --> 01:55:37.831 region:rollup2
DIVIDES THE STATE INTO TEN

01:55:35.896 --> 01:55:39.232 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REGIONS AND PLOTS

01:55:37.831 --> 01:55:40.534 region:rollup2
RATIOS OF PRIMARY CARE

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:42.402 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALISTS

01:55:40.534 --> 01:55:44.204 region:rollup2
POSITIONS TO POPULATION. THE

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:45.906 region:rollup2
REASON WE PLOT THE RATIOS RATHER

01:55:44.204 --> 01:55:47.107 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS IS AS YOU KNOW VERY

01:55:45.906 --> 01:55:48.842 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:55:47.107 --> 01:55:50.377 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION OF THE DIFFERENT

01:55:48.842 --> 01:55:52.145 region:rollup2
REGIONS OF OUR STATE VARIES

01:55:50.377 --> 01:55:53.947 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY WE HAVE VERY DENSE

01:55:52.145 --> 01:55:56.149 region:rollup2
URBAN CORES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO

01:55:53.947 --> 01:55:57.450 region:rollup2
IN VERY WORLD PLACES AND MR

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:58.552 region:rollup2
AROUND WHAT MISTER WOODS

01:55:57.450 --> 01:56:01.254 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AND OTHER DISTRICTS.

01:55:58.552 --> 01:56:02.923 region:rollup2
IN SO PUTTING THEM ON THE RATIO

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:04.057 region:rollup2
POPPER CAPITA YOU GIVES YOU A

01:56:02.923 --> 01:56:05.892 region:rollup2
SCALE WHERE YOU CAN MAKE

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:07.527 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS. AND ONE

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:08.829 region:rollup2
OF THE KEY THINGS WE SEE HERE IF

01:56:07.527 --> 01:56:10.497 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THE PRIMARY CARE

01:56:08.829 --> 01:56:12.666 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS IN GOLD AND THE

01:56:10.497 --> 01:56:14.601 region:rollup2
SPECIALISTS IN BLUE.

01:56:12.666 --> 01:56:17.304 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

01:56:14.601 --> 01:56:18.905 region:rollup2
THE INLAND EMPIRE.

01:56:17.304 --> 01:56:20.540 region:rollup2
NORTHERN IN SIERRA AND SAN

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:22.142 region:rollup2
JOAQUIN VALLEY REGION'S TEND TO

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:23.210 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST RATIOS

01:56:22.142 --> 01:56:24.511 region:rollup2
OF BOTH PRIMARY CARE AND

01:56:23.210 --> 01:56:26.012 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST POSITIONS TO

01:56:24.511 --> 01:56:28.582 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS OF SAN JOAQUIN

01:56:26.012 --> 01:56:30.517 region:rollup2
VALLEY. INCLUDES FRESNO COUNTY.

01:56:28.582 --> 01:56:31.384 region:rollup2
MR RAMBLERS DISTRICT NORTHERN

01:56:30.517 --> 01:56:33.486 region:rollup2
SIERRA.

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:34.621 region:rollup2
INCLUDES MUCH OF MISTER WOODS

01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:36.189 region:rollup2
DISTRICT EXCEPT PERSON NO

01:56:34.621 --> 01:56:38.692 region:rollup2
MECHANIC WHICH IS IN THE GREATER

01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:40.827 region:rollup2
BAY AREA SO LOT OF VARIATION YET

01:56:38.692 --> 01:56:43.997 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE VARIATION RATIO

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:45.432 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST A POPULATION. OUGHT

01:56:43.997 --> 01:56:47.300 region:rollup2
THEN PRIMARY CARE.

01:56:45.432 --> 01:56:48.435 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TRAIL DOWN

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:49.269 region:rollup2
BELOW THE REGIONAL AREA BECAUSE

01:56:48.435 --> 01:56:51.738 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE MULTI

01:56:49.269 --> 01:56:53.673 region:rollup2
COUNTY REGION'S IT'S MAY ASKING

01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:55.609 region:rollup2
VARIATION EVEN WHEN WE LOOK AT A

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:56.710 region:rollup2
PLACE LIKE LOS ANGELES. OUGHT

01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:58.578 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

01:56:56.710 --> 01:57:00.780 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT COUNTY THERE'S

01:56:58.578 --> 01:57:02.616 region:rollup2
QUITE A WIDE VARIATION IN SUPPLY

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:04.050 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS A MAP PREPARED BY

01:57:02.616 --> 01:57:06.219 region:rollup2
THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:07.787 region:rollup2
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. OF

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:09.422 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE HEALTH PROFESSIONS

01:57:07.787 --> 01:57:10.757 region:rollup2
AYE SHORTAGE AREAS AND I

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:11.691 region:rollup2
APOLOGIZE THAT'S.

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:14.027 region:rollup2
CUTTING OFF ON THE SCREEN A

01:57:11.691 --> 01:57:15.161 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT BUT I'M THE PARENT

01:57:14.027 --> 01:57:17.163 region:rollup2
HEALTH PROFICIENCY ORTIZ AREAS

01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:18.131 region:rollup2
THESE ARE AREAS DESIGNATED BY

01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:19.933 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:21.368 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH POSH BID. AYE

01:57:19.933 --> 01:57:23.436 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DEEMED TO HAVE CRITICAL

01:57:21.368 --> 01:57:24.804 region:rollup2
SHORTAGES IN THIS CASE CRITICAL

01:57:23.436 --> 01:57:26.306 region:rollup2
SHORTAGES OF PRIMARY CARE

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:28.508 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND SO THIS MEANS

01:57:26.306 --> 01:57:30.210 region:rollup2
THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE FEWER.

01:57:28.508 --> 01:57:32.012 region:rollup2
THAN ONE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN

01:57:30.210 --> 01:57:33.980 region:rollup2
POORER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:57:32.012 --> 01:57:35.949 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHICH IS ABOUT LESS THAN

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:37.384 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE PRIMARY CARE

01:57:35.949 --> 01:57:38.618 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED

01:57:37.384 --> 01:57:39.185 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

01:57:38.618 --> 01:57:41.321 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS OF THIS IS QUITE

01:57:39.185 --> 01:57:43.290 region:rollup2
LOW.

01:57:41.321 --> 01:57:45.292 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:46.826 region:rollup2
AND IF WE LOOK AT THIS MAP THE

01:57:45.292 --> 01:57:48.728 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT ARE IN THE RUST COLOR

01:57:46.826 --> 01:57:50.630 region:rollup2
ARE A PRIME MAKERS SHORTAGE AREA

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:52.465 region:rollup2
FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION THAT

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:54.434 region:rollup2
MEANS ANYBODY WHETHER YOU'RE

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:56.236 region:rollup2
INSURED UNINSURED. WHETHER YOU

01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:57.971 region:rollup2
HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE MEDICARE

01:57:56.236 --> 01:57:59.739 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL THERE'S A SHORTAGE THE

01:57:57.971 --> 01:58:01.141 region:rollup2
CREAM COLORED AREAS ARE AREAS

01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:02.876 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S A STORAGE OF

01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:04.444 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WILLING TO SERVE A

01:58:02.876 --> 01:58:06.379 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR POPULATION COULD BE

01:58:04.444 --> 01:58:08.114 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES COULD BE

01:58:06.379 --> 01:58:09.215 region:rollup2
FARMWORKERS COULD BE UNINSURED.

01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:11.384 region:rollup2
I'M SO THINK POINTING

01:58:09.215 --> 01:58:13.353 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICALLY THE VAST MAJORITY

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:14.988 region:rollup2
THE SERIES ARE IN RURAL AREAS

01:58:13.353 --> 01:58:15.855 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IF YOU NOTICE IF YOU

01:58:14.988 --> 01:58:17.857 region:rollup2
LOOKED DOWN.

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:19.125 region:rollup2
SEE WHERE LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:21.261 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE COUNTY IS ADEQUATE

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:22.529 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S SOME LITTLE POCKET

01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:23.697 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SMALL POCKETS.

01:58:22.529 --> 01:58:24.898 region:rollup2
OF SHORTAGE IN THOSE ARE PLACES

01:58:23.697 --> 01:58:26.399 region:rollup2
LIKE THE HIGH DESERT IN

01:58:24.898 --> 01:58:28.134 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY SOUTH CENTRAL BOYLE

IMPORTANT TO NOT FORGET THAT

01:58:32.872 --> 01:58:35.842 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS IN

01:58:34.541 --> 01:58:37.177 region:rollup2
INNER CITY AREAS.

01:58:35.842 --> 01:58:38.979 region:rollup2

THAT'S A SHORTAGE IS FOR

01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:03.770 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SEGMENTS OF THE

01:59:13.213 --> 01:59:15.849 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT HAVE

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:18.451 region:rollup2

01:59:15.849 --> 01:59:19.452 region:rollup2
INNER CITY AREAS ALSO STRUGGLING

01:59:18.451 --> 01:59:20.453 region:rollup2

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:27.460 region:rollup2
THE MOST RACIALLY ETHNICALLY

01:59:26.926 --> 01:59:29.963 region:rollup2

R. PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE NOT SO

01:59:32.332 --> 01:59:35.335 region:rollup2
MUCH OF WE LOOK ON THE RIGHT

HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE THAT'S

01:59:35.335 --> 01:59:38.772 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION IN

TWENTY FIFTEEN.

ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS BUREAU

01:59:41.141 --> 01:59:43.877 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME SIX PERCENT OF OUR

01:59:42.409 --> 01:59:45.345 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:59:43.877 --> 01:59:47.647 region:rollup2
WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN THIRTY

01:59:45.345 --> 01:59:49.315 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT OF LATINO AND WE

01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:50.884 region:rollup2
SEE IF WE LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE

01:59:49.315 --> 01:59:52.585 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL PHYSICIANS IN THE

01:59:50.884 --> 01:59:52.886 region:rollup2
NEXT TO THAT PRIMARY CARE

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:54.387 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS.

01:59:52.886 --> 01:59:55.689 region:rollup2
.

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:57.524 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT OF OUR PHYSICIANS

01:59:55.689 --> 01:59:59.259 region:rollup2
ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN VERSUS SIX

01:59:57.524 --> 02:00:00.827 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AND IF

01:59:59.259 --> 02:00:02.362 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT LATINOS SOME EVEN

02:00:00.827 --> 02:00:04.431 region:rollup2
BIGGER GRAPHS SEVEN PERCENT OF

02:00:11.071 --> 02:00:14.574 region:rollup2
EIGHT BOTH ARE BETTER IN TERMS

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:16.176 region:rollup2

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:17.877 region:rollup2
NOWHERE NEAR POPULATION.

02:00:16.176 --> 02:00:19.212 region:rollup2
PARITY WHY DOES THIS MATTER WHY

02:00:17.877 --> 02:00:21.281 region:rollup2
I THINK WE PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE

02:00:19.212 --> 02:00:23.817 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE OFTEN FORM STRONGER

02:00:21.281 --> 02:00:26.052 region:rollup2

02:00:57.617 --> 02:01:02.288 region:rollup2
FOUR ARE AGE SIXTY. OR OLDER AND

02:01:01.054 --> 02:01:03.456 region:rollup2
NOW SOME OF THEM WILL KEEP

02:01:02.288 --> 02:01:04.724 region:rollup2
WORKING FOR MANY YEARS BUT A LOT

02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:06.025 region:rollup2
OF THEM AT THE AS THEY REACH

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:07.827 region:rollup2
INTO THEIR SEVENTIES WERE EITHER

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:09.429 region:rollup2
RETIRE OR SUBSTANTIALLY CUT BACK

02:01:07.827 --> 02:01:11.164 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK HOURS.

02:01:09.429 --> 02:01:12.966 region:rollup2
I'M IN SOME REGIONS OF THE STATE

02:01:11.164 --> 02:01:14.200 region:rollup2
HAVE PERCENTAGES OF DOCTORS AGE

02:01:12.966 --> 02:01:15.468 region:rollup2
SIXTY YEARS OR OLDER THAT ARE

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.336 region:rollup2
EVEN HIGHER SO THE NORTHERN AND

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:18.271 region:rollup2

SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

02:01:28.548 --> 02:01:31.351 region:rollup2
AND IN GENERAL IT'S HARD TO SAY

02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:33.586 region:rollup2
THAT RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE

02:01:31.351 --> 02:01:35.388 region:rollup2
TEND TO HAVE OLDER PHYSICIANS

02:01:33.586 --> 02:01:38.124 region:rollup2
ARE THEY IN URBAN AREAS.

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:39.626 region:rollup2
A FEW FACTS ABOUT MEDICAL

02:01:38.124 --> 02:01:41.461 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND IT HAS YOU KNOW.

02:01:39.626 --> 02:01:43.530 region:rollup2
POSITIONS FIRST COMPLETE

02:01:41.461 --> 02:01:45.932 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THEN GO ON TO

02:01:43.530 --> 02:01:47.467 region:rollup2
COMPLETE A RESIDENCY PROGRAM.

02:01:45.932 --> 02:01:48.701 region:rollup2
ARMS SHOW IN TWO THOUSAND

02:01:47.467 --> 02:01:49.235 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THE LATEST YEAR FOR

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:51.204 region:rollup2
WHICH.

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:52.572 region:rollup2
I HAVE COMPLETE DATA ONE

02:01:51.204 --> 02:01:54.240 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND

02:01:52.572 --> 02:01:56.209 region:rollup2

02:01:57.177 --> 02:02:01.347 region:rollup2
IN OVER TWO THIRDS ABOUT ELEVEN

02:01:59.345 --> 02:02:03.082 region:rollup2
THOUSAND OF THOSE WERE FROM AN

02:02:01.347 --> 02:02:04.050 region:rollup2
ALLOPATHIC IN INDY GRANTING

02:02:03.082 --> 02:02:05.985 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SO THAT WOULD BE THE

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:07.554 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:08.188 region:rollup2

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN

02:02:08.188 --> 02:02:12.292 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AND THEN WE HAVE TO

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:13.293 region:rollup2
OSTEOPATHIC DO GRANTING SCHOOLS

02:02:12.292 --> 02:02:15.061 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO GO UP

02:02:13.293 --> 02:02:16.196 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE SEVERAL MEDICAL

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:18.832 region:rollup2

MEDICAL STUDENTS.

02:02:29.108 --> 02:02:32.178 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

02:02:30.577 --> 02:02:33.680 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS ITS REALLY IMPORTANT

02:02:32.178 --> 02:02:36.349 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT RESIDENCY DATA

02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:37.784 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. WHERE A PERSON DOES HIS

02:02:36.349 --> 02:02:38.818 region:rollup2
OR HER RESIDENCY IS A MUCH

02:02:37.784 --> 02:02:40.520 region:rollup2
STRONGER PREDICTOR OF WHERE

02:02:38.818 --> 02:02:41.588 region:rollup2
AVAIL PRACTICE?

02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.223 region:rollup2
OUGHT THEN WHERE THEY GO TO

02:02:41.588 --> 02:02:44.224 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SCHOOL A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:02:43.223 --> 02:02:45.825 region:rollup2
MOVE AROUND A LOT OF OUR

02:02:44.224 --> 02:02:46.860 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS GO OUT OF STATE.

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:48.528 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THEN COME

02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:49.963 region:rollup2
BACK FOR RESIDENCIA RESIDENCIES

02:02:48.528 --> 02:02:51.764 region:rollup2
RELATED IN TERMS OF GETTING

02:02:49.963 --> 02:02:53.032 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHERE WE NEED THEM TO GO.

02:02:51.764 --> 02:02:54.601 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO FOCUS.

02:02:53.032 --> 02:02:56.736 region:rollup2
.

02:02:54.601 --> 02:02:58.538 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD ABOUT

02:02:56.736 --> 02:02:59.839 region:rollup2
ONE THOUSAND WHO WERE FIRST YEAR

02:02:58.538 --> 02:03:01.874 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS IN A NON PRIMARY CARE

02:02:59.839 --> 02:03:02.909 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY. AND ABOUT FIFTEEN

02:03:01.874 --> 02:03:04.077 region:rollup2
HUNDRED WHO WERE FIRST YEAR

02:03:02.909 --> 02:03:06.279 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS IN A PRIMARY CARE

02:03:04.077 --> 02:03:07.647 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY HOWEVER I NOTE THAT OF

02:03:06.279 --> 02:03:10.083 region:rollup2
THOSE STARTING IN A PRIMARY CARE

02:03:07.647 --> 02:03:11.351 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY. HAFER ARE LIKELY TO

02:03:10.083 --> 02:03:12.352 region:rollup2
GO ON A SUB SPECIALISTS WHO SAY

02:03:11.351 --> 02:03:14.120 region:rollup2
THEY DO A GENERAL INTERNAL

02:03:12.352 --> 02:03:15.088 region:rollup2
MEDICINE RESIDENCY. AND THEN

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.657 region:rollup2
THEY GO ON THE SUB SPECIALIZED

02:03:15.088 --> 02:03:19.025 region:rollup2
IN CARDIOLOGY ERGASTER NEUROLOGY

02:03:17.657 --> 02:03:20.393 region:rollup2
IN IN THOSE ARE SURELY IMPORTANT

02:03:19.025 --> 02:03:21.494 region:rollup2
SPECIALTIES BUT I THINK IN OUR

02:03:20.393 --> 02:03:23.129 region:rollup2
STATE WE STRUGGLE THE MOST OF

02:03:21.494 --> 02:03:24.197 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE SUPPLIES THAT WE

02:03:23.129 --> 02:03:25.231 region:rollup2
NEED TO KEEP THAT AND WE NEED TO

02:03:24.197 --> 02:03:26.733 region:rollup2
JUST. WHEN WE SEE THAT FIFTEEN

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:28.568 region:rollup2
HUNDRED NUMBER REMEMBER THAT NOT

02:03:26.733 --> 02:03:31.004 region:rollup2
ALL FIFTEEN HUNDRED ARE GOING TO

02:03:28.568 --> 02:03:33.806 region:rollup2
PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE.

02:03:31.004 --> 02:03:34.540 region:rollup2
OKAY ROOM BRIEFLY CONTRIBUTIONS

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:37.076 region:rollup2
OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:40.079 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN AYE ASSISTANCE

02:03:37.076 --> 02:03:41.180 region:rollup2
I'M SO MPS AND PAC ARE A MAJOR

02:03:40.079 --> 02:03:43.950 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF PRIMARY CARE

02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:45.418 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN RURAL CARACALLA

02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:46.519 region:rollup2
FORGET THEY DO PLAY IMPORTANT

02:03:45.418 --> 02:03:48.554 region:rollup2
ROLE AND FILLING GAPS IN SOME OF

02:03:46.519 --> 02:03:50.356 region:rollup2
OUR RURAL AREAS. WHERE CLINICS

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:51.758 region:rollup2
AND OTHER PROVIDERS STRUGGLE?

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:53.593 region:rollup2
AYE TO RECRUIT PHYSICIANS

02:03:51.758 --> 02:03:55.328 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT KEEP IN

02:03:53.593 --> 02:03:57.196 region:rollup2
MIND THAT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN

02:03:55.328 --> 02:03:58.531 region:rollup2
PIECING PA'S IN CALIFORNIA ARE

02:03:57.196 --> 02:04:00.566 region:rollup2
MUCH SMALLER.

02:03:58.531 --> 02:04:02.135 region:rollup2
THEN THE NUMBERS OF PHYSICIANS

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:03.670 region:rollup2
AND SO WHY THINK IT'S CERTAINLY

02:04:02.135 --> 02:04:05.004 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT INCREASING

02:04:03.670 --> 02:04:06.039 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBERS IT'S IMPORTANT

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:08.107 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE STARTING

02:04:06.039 --> 02:04:10.910 region:rollup2
FOR A MUCH SMALLER BASE.

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:12.612 region:rollup2
IN OUR TEAM AT THE AYE UCSF

02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:15.014 region:rollup2
MYSELF MY COLLEAGUE CHANCE BATS.

02:04:12.612 --> 02:04:17.216 region:rollup2
HAVE JOHN SOME PROJECTIONS OF

02:04:15.014 --> 02:04:18.818 region:rollup2
FUTURE SUPPLIES OF PRIMARY CARE

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:20.219 region:rollup2
NURSE PRACTITIONERS PHYSICIAN

02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:21.487 region:rollup2
ASSISTANTS AND PRIMARY CARE

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:23.156 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS.

02:04:21.487 --> 02:04:25.491 region:rollup2
IN OUR CONCLUSION IS THAT

02:04:23.156 --> 02:04:27.327 region:rollup2
NUMBERS OF PRIMARY CARE IN PEACE

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:28.895 region:rollup2
MPAS RESPECTED TOOK TO INCREASE

02:04:27.327 --> 02:04:30.530 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IF INCREASES IN

02:04:28.895 --> 02:04:32.398 region:rollup2
RISK OF IN IN ENROLLMENT. IN

02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:33.967 region:rollup2
TRAINING PROGRAMS CONTINUE AT

02:04:32.398 --> 02:04:35.401 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT PACE BUT THEIR

02:04:33.967 --> 02:04:37.370 region:rollup2
GROWTH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO

02:04:35.401 --> 02:04:38.938 region:rollup2
OFFSET THE PROJECTED DECREASE IN

02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:40.039 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE

02:04:38.938 --> 02:04:41.574 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS THAT ON THE POSITION

02:04:40.039 --> 02:04:43.076 region:rollup2
SITE. WE'RE NOT TRAINING NEW

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:43.543 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AT THE SAME RATE AS

02:04:43.076 --> 02:04:47.013 region:rollup2
FOLKS ARE EXITING THE

02:04:43.543 --> 02:04:47.947 region:rollup2
PROFESSION.

02:04:47.013 --> 02:04:49.649 region:rollup2
I MEAN THIS IS JUST TO HELP

02:04:47.947 --> 02:04:50.516 region:rollup2
REINFORCE THAT POINT WHERE SOME

02:04:49.649 --> 02:04:52.919 region:rollup2
DATA.

02:04:50.516 --> 02:04:54.887 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ADD UP INDIES AND DE

02:04:52.919 --> 02:04:56.789 region:rollup2
OWES THE TWO TYPES OF POSITIONS

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:58.424 region:rollup2
WE GET ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND

02:04:56.789 --> 02:05:01.294 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE.

02:04:58.424 --> 02:05:03.730 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE I AM IF

02:05:01.294 --> 02:05:07.500 region:rollup2
WE A OUT UP IN PEACE MPAS AND

02:05:03.730 --> 02:05:09.135 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE. UP WE GET ABOUT.

02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:11.104 region:rollup2
TWELVE I TWELVE THOUSAND

02:05:09.135 --> 02:05:12.505 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN THOUSAND IT IN OTHER

02:05:11.104 --> 02:05:13.506 region:rollup2
KEY THING HERE IS I THINK IT'S

02:05:12.505 --> 02:05:15.842 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

02:05:13.506 --> 02:05:18.211 region:rollup2
LIKE PHYSICIANS. THERE ARE LARGE

02:05:15.842 --> 02:05:19.812 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONS OF IN PEACE MPAS WHO

02:05:18.211 --> 02:05:21.714 region:rollup2
ARE SPECIALISTS THEY DON'T ALL

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:23.549 region:rollup2
PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE AND IN FACT

02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:25.518 region:rollup2
THERE'S A YOU KNOW BIG MARKET

02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:27.787 region:rollup2
FOR WORK IN PEACE MPAS IN

02:05:25.518 --> 02:05:29.722 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY CARRIED NATIONWIDE.

02:05:27.787 --> 02:05:31.691 region:rollup2
A RECENT STUDY OF AB JOB

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:32.759 region:rollup2
ADVERTISEMENTS FOR IN PNP JOBS

02:05:31.691 --> 02:05:34.093 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF JOBS

02:05:32.759 --> 02:05:36.562 region:rollup2
FOR ON THE SPECIALLY SIDE

02:05:34.093 --> 02:05:37.630 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY PRACTICES ALSO TEND TO

02:05:36.562 --> 02:05:38.464 region:rollup2
PAY BETTER.

02:05:37.630 --> 02:05:39.832 region:rollup2
I'M SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY

02:05:38.464 --> 02:05:41.501 region:rollup2
SURPRISE THAT WE'RE SEEING YOUR

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:44.404 region:rollup2
PRE LARGE PROPORTIONS OF MPS

02:05:41.501 --> 02:05:45.972 region:rollup2
MPAS GO THAT ROUTE.

02:05:44.404 --> 02:05:47.740 region:rollup2
SO NOW LET ME COMMENT BRIEFLY ON

02:05:45.972 --> 02:05:50.109 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES FOR MEETING PHYSICIAN

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:53.112 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE. NEEDS.

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:54.814 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS A TYPOLOGY THAT OUR

02:05:53.112 --> 02:05:57.817 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AND I PREPARED OFF

02:05:54.814 --> 02:05:59.452 region:rollup2
FOR A FORTHCOMING REPORT IN

02:05:57.817 --> 02:06:00.653 region:rollup2
THERE DO THE TYPOLOGY IS KIND OF

02:05:59.452 --> 02:06:02.422 region:rollup2
A WAY TO GIVE YOU A AWAY THE

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:04.223 region:rollup2
TAXI GIVE FOUR BIG BUCKETS OF

02:06:02.422 --> 02:06:04.957 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE

02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:05.124 region:rollup2
UTILIZED.

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:07.293 region:rollup2
TO.

02:06:05.124 --> 02:06:09.061 region:rollup2
.

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:10.863 region:rollup2
ADDRESS POSITION WORKFORCE

02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:11.964 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA IN THE

02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:13.866 region:rollup2
FIRST IS ENHANCING THE

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:15.835 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL PIPELINES INCREASING

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:17.804 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. ENTERING

02:06:15.835 --> 02:06:19.172 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SCHOOL OTHER HEALTH

02:06:17.804 --> 02:06:21.808 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS THAT PROVIDE PRIMARY

02:06:19.172 --> 02:06:23.176 region:rollup2
CARE. VERTICALLY FOCUSING AND IN

02:06:21.808 --> 02:06:25.078 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO JUST PRODUCING MORE

02:06:23.176 --> 02:06:26.712 region:rollup2
TARGETING AND FOCUSING ON FOLKS

02:06:25.078 --> 02:06:28.881 region:rollup2
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING

02:06:26.712 --> 02:06:30.850 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE. IN UNDERSERVED

02:06:28.881 --> 02:06:31.951 region:rollup2
AREAS OF THE STATE AND PREPARING

02:06:30.850 --> 02:06:33.519 region:rollup2
THE SPOKES TO PRACTICE

02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:34.554 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY IN THOSE SETTINGS

02:06:33.519 --> 02:06:35.988 region:rollup2
SECOND WOULD BE CREATING

02:06:34.554 --> 02:06:37.223 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES FOR RECRUITMENT AND

02:06:35.988 --> 02:06:38.658 region:rollup2
RETENTION A PRIMARY CARE FOR

02:06:37.223 --> 02:06:40.493 region:rollup2
SPECIALS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS

02:06:38.658 --> 02:06:41.994 region:rollup2
AND HAS WE TRAIN MORE. CREATING

02:06:40.493 --> 02:06:44.530 region:rollup2
THE INCENTIVES AS THEY FINISH

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:45.998 region:rollup2
RESIDENCY REBA TRUCK TO GO TO

02:06:44.530 --> 02:06:48.034 region:rollup2
THE PLACES WE NEED THE MOST.

02:06:45.998 --> 02:06:49.735 region:rollup2
THIRD MAXIMIZING THE EXISTING

02:06:48.034 --> 02:06:51.137 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE IN THAT'S NUMBER A LOT

02:06:49.735 --> 02:06:53.005 region:rollup2
FOR A LOT OF THINGS TO CHRIS

02:06:51.137 --> 02:06:54.974 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT. AROUND DELIVERY

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:55.708 region:rollup2
REFORM PAYMENT REFORM EXPANDED

02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:57.844 region:rollup2
USE OF.

02:06:55.708 --> 02:07:00.379 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IN TELEHEALTH IN

02:06:57.844 --> 02:07:02.448 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS CAN ALSO ENCOMPASS

02:07:00.379 --> 02:07:04.050 region:rollup2
AYE CHANGES IN STATE. OUR SCOPE

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:05.885 region:rollup2
OF PRACTICE

02:07:04.050 --> 02:07:08.087 region:rollup2
REGULATION NEO SO THAT FOLKS ARE

02:07:05.885 --> 02:07:09.155 region:rollup2
USED TO THE FULL EXTENT THEIR

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:10.723 region:rollup2
CAPACITY THERE ARE SOME

02:07:09.155 --> 02:07:12.492 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS MOST NOTABLY NURSE

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:14.327 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS WERE OUR SCOPE OF

02:07:12.492 --> 02:07:14.927 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IS CONSIDERABLY MORE

02:07:14.327 --> 02:07:16.028 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIVE THAN THAT OF MANY

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:17.730 region:rollup2
STATES.

02:07:16.028 --> 02:07:19.232 region:rollup2
UP AND THEN LASTLY YOU KNOW

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:20.867 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M IN AT AN ACADEMIC

02:07:19.232 --> 02:07:23.536 region:rollup2
WHO LIKES TO PLAY WITH DATA.

02:07:20.867 --> 02:07:24.737 region:rollup2
LEVERAGING DATA AND I THINK NOT

02:07:23.536 --> 02:07:26.172 region:rollup2
ONLY BECAUSE IT'S INTERESTING

02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:27.607 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:07:26.172 --> 02:07:29.742 region:rollup2
KNOW TO MAKE THEM SOUND

02:07:27.607 --> 02:07:31.210 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ABOUT OUR WORKFORCE

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:32.745 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.913 region:rollup2
COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA SO THAT

02:07:32.745 --> 02:07:35.615 region:rollup2
WE KNOW ARE THE THING ARE WE ARE

02:07:33.913 --> 02:07:37.183 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT WERE. ARE OUR

02:07:35.615 --> 02:07:38.818 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO STE FIX THE PROBLEM

02:07:37.183 --> 02:07:41.354 region:rollup2
REALLY WORKING.

02:07:38.818 --> 02:07:43.389 region:rollup2
I AM SO FEW KEY TRADE OFFS THAT

02:07:41.354 --> 02:07:44.724 region:rollup2
I THINK ARE IMPORTANT AS. OUGHT

02:07:43.389 --> 02:07:46.325 region:rollup2
YOU THINK ABOUT INVESTMENT

02:07:44.724 --> 02:07:47.793 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES IN THE PHYSICIAN

02:07:46.325 --> 02:07:49.629 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE EIGHT I THINK

02:07:47.793 --> 02:07:50.863 region:rollup2
EXPANDING TRAINING CAPACITY IN

02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:52.899 region:rollup2
RECRUITING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:53.1000 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS

02:07:52.899 --> 02:07:55.701 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE WHO REFLECT THE

02:07:53.1000 --> 02:07:56.769 region:rollup2
STATE'S. RACIAL ETHNIC DIVERSITY

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:58.671 region:rollup2
THESE ARE CRITICAL THESE ARE

02:07:56.769 --> 02:08:00.239 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL TO ADDRESS THE

02:07:58.671 --> 02:08:01.707 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:02.775 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S POSITION WORKFORCE.

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:03.743 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

02:08:02.775 --> 02:08:05.645 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE NOT

02:08:03.743 --> 02:08:07.146 region:rollup2
QUICK FIXES.

02:08:05.645 --> 02:08:09.515 region:rollup2
IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE LENGTH

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:10.883 region:rollup2
OF TRAINING THAT. MEDICAL SCHOOL

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:12.051 region:rollup2
TAKES FOUR YEARS WE HAVE A FEW

02:08:10.883 --> 02:08:13.653 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF THREE OR PROGRAMS

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:14.654 region:rollup2
BUT THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS ARE

02:08:13.653 --> 02:08:16.422 region:rollup2
DOING FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL

02:08:14.654 --> 02:08:18.658 region:rollup2
SCHOOL. AND AT LEAST THREE YEARS

02:08:16.422 --> 02:08:19.225 region:rollup2
OF RESIDENCY AND MANY MORE THAN

02:08:18.658 --> 02:08:20.826 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS AND SOME OF THE

02:08:19.225 --> 02:08:22.862 region:rollup2
SPECIALTIES.

02:08:20.826 --> 02:08:23.996 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED TO AUGMENT TRAIT

02:08:22.862 --> 02:08:25.498 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT FOCUS ON

02:08:23.996 --> 02:08:27.567 region:rollup2
EXPANDING TRAINING.

02:08:25.498 --> 02:08:29.435 region:rollup2
A PASSERBY WITH STRATEGIES THAT

02:08:27.567 --> 02:08:31.103 region:rollup2
AS I SAID INCENTIVIZE NEW GRADS

02:08:29.435 --> 02:08:32.705 region:rollup2
TO PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS

02:08:31.103 --> 02:08:34.340 region:rollup2
SUPPORT RETENTION OF POSITION IN

02:08:32.705 --> 02:08:36.409 region:rollup2
THOSE AREAS. ENCOURAGE TEAM

02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:37.577 region:rollup2
BASED PRACTICE SO THAT WHERE

02:08:36.409 --> 02:08:39.946 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

02:08:37.577 --> 02:08:41.547 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO MEET PEOPLE'S

02:08:39.946 --> 02:08:42.648 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE NEEDS THAT CAN BE

02:08:41.547 --> 02:08:43.883 region:rollup2
DONE BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:45.585 region:rollup2
POSITIONS THAT WERE DOING THAT

02:08:43.883 --> 02:08:46.619 region:rollup2
IN A TEAM BASED WAY THAT COULD

02:08:45.585 --> 02:08:48.154 region:rollup2
BE COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSE IT

02:08:46.619 --> 02:08:49.789 region:rollup2
REGISTERED NURSES. COULD BE

02:08:48.154 --> 02:08:52.358 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ALL

02:08:49.789 --> 02:08:53.960 region:rollup2
COACHES PHARMACISTS LOT OF FOLKS

02:08:52.358 --> 02:08:54.961 region:rollup2
WHO COULDN'T DENTISTS.

02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:55.761 region:rollup2
OR OVERTURN THE DENTAL

02:08:54.961 --> 02:08:57.263 region:rollup2
HYGIENISTS.

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:58.831 region:rollup2
BUT THE IDEAS WE WANT WE DON'T

02:08:57.263 --> 02:09:00.266 region:rollup2
HAVE A WHOLE TEAM SO THAT THE

02:08:58.831 --> 02:09:01.968 region:rollup2
GOAL IS HOW TO WHERE HARRY

02:09:00.266 --> 02:09:03.502 region:rollup2
BRINGING THE FULL TEAM TO BEAR.

02:09:01.968 --> 02:09:05.238 region:rollup2
TO MEET HEALTH NEEDS AND NOT

02:09:03.502 --> 02:09:07.273 region:rollup2
JUST ASKING THE PHYSICIAN TO DO

02:09:05.238 --> 02:09:09.041 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THAT'S

02:09:07.273 --> 02:09:11.644 region:rollup2
JUST NOT. SUSTAINABLE.

02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:12.945 region:rollup2
SEWER CONCLUSION REAL QUICKLY

02:09:11.644 --> 02:09:14.280 region:rollup2
YES SOME RURAL INNER CITIES A

02:09:12.945 --> 02:09:15.514 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAVE SHORTAGES OF

02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:16.949 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS IN SOME PLACES IT'S

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:18.651 region:rollup2
NOT JUST.

02:09:16.949 --> 02:09:20.286 region:rollup2
A SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS WILLING

02:09:18.651 --> 02:09:21.220 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PARTICULAR

02:09:20.286 --> 02:09:23.723 region:rollup2

PULL ON THE THREAT OF COVERAGE

02:10:42.635 --> 02:10:46.072 region:rollup2
CHURN NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT

02:10:44.904 --> 02:10:46.939 region:rollup2
BASED ON MY OWN RESEARCH AND

02:10:46.072 --> 02:10:47.840 region:rollup2
THAT OF OTHERS.

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:49.709 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES MORE

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.343 region:rollup2
BROADLY.

02:10:49.709 --> 02:10:52.411 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS GO

IS IS LAY OUT.

02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:55.748 region:rollup2
SOME INFORMATION FOR YOU NOT

02:10:54.613 --> 02:10:57.216 region:rollup2
ONLY ON THE PREVALENCE OF

02:10:55.748 --> 02:10:58.417 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONS ARE TURNED OVER IN

02:10:57.216 --> 02:11:00.586 region:rollup2
IN IN HEALTH INSURANCE UNITED

02:10:58.417 --> 02:11:02.555 region:rollup2
STATES. BUT ALSO TALK ABOUT ITS

02:11:00.586 --> 02:11:04.623 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES FOR ACCESS COSTS

02:11:02.555 --> 02:11:06.492 region:rollup2
AND UTILIZATION AND THEN SPEND A

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:08.027 region:rollup2
FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT SHORT

02:11:06.492 --> 02:11:09.028 region:rollup2
TERM AND LONGER TERM ISSUES THAT

02:11:08.027 --> 02:11:10.730 region:rollup2
WILL COME UP.

02:11:09.028 --> 02:11:11.564 region:rollup2
OF BOTH FEDERALLY AND AT THE

02:11:10.730 --> 02:11:12.665 region:rollup2
STATE LEVEL.

02:11:11.564 --> 02:11:13.833 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU'LL NEED TO PAY

02:11:12.665 --> 02:11:16.102 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO.

02:11:13.833 --> 02:11:16.669 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD AS YOU GO

02:11:16.102 --> 02:11:18.404 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT YOUR YOUR PROCESS

02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:19.805 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:11:18.404 --> 02:11:20.639 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO SET US ALL ON THE

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:22.541 region:rollup2
SAME STAGE.

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:25.411 region:rollup2
WHAT WE GENERALLY MEAN WHEN WE

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:27.313 region:rollup2
REFER TO CHURN IS TRANSITIONS IN

02:11:25.411 --> 02:11:29.348 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE THAT ARE DUE TO

02:11:27.313 --> 02:11:30.916 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN INCOME? A PERSON'S

02:11:29.348 --> 02:11:32.351 region:rollup2
JOB CIRCUMSTANCES OR THEIR

02:11:30.916 --> 02:11:34.353 region:rollup2
FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES GETTING

02:11:32.351 --> 02:11:35.755 region:rollup2
MARRIED DIVORCED ETCETERA.

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:37.957 region:rollup2
SO THIS IN THIS COULD BE ARE

02:11:35.755 --> 02:11:40.226 region:rollup2
MOVING FROM EMPLOYER BASED PLAN.

02:11:37.957 --> 02:11:41.961 region:rollup2
DUE TO A JOB CHANGE INTO A

02:11:40.226 --> 02:11:43.829 region:rollup2
PERIOD WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE

02:11:41.961 --> 02:11:45.431 region:rollup2
A COULD MEET MEAN MOVING FROM

02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:47.099 region:rollup2
MEDICAID OUT INTO A COVER

02:11:45.431 --> 02:11:48.601 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF AN INCOME

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:50.069 region:rollup2
CHANGE IT CETERA. BUT IT CAN

02:11:48.601 --> 02:11:51.871 region:rollup2
ALSO MEAN OTHER THINGS.

02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:52.972 region:rollup2
SUCH AS ARE JUST TRANSITIONING

02:11:51.871 --> 02:11:54.407 region:rollup2
FROM ONE EMPLOYER BASED PLAN TO

02:11:52.972 --> 02:11:56.675 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND I'LL GET INTO THAT A

02:11:54.407 --> 02:11:58.043 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT IN A MINUTE.

02:11:56.675 --> 02:11:59.245 region:rollup2
SO THE TOP PLATE NUMBER I WANT

02:11:58.043 --> 02:12:00.980 region:rollup2
YOU TO TAKE AWAY IS THAT BASED

02:11:59.245 --> 02:12:02.114 region:rollup2
ON OUR RESEARCH WHAT WE FOUND IS

02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:03.682 region:rollup2
THAT EACH YEAR ONE IN SIX U. S.

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:04.283 region:rollup2
ADULTS.

02:12:03.682 --> 02:12:06.352 region:rollup2
CHANGE THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF

02:12:04.283 --> 02:12:07.386 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE.

02:12:06.352 --> 02:12:08.587 region:rollup2
THIS IS ACTUALLY A LOWER

02:12:07.386 --> 02:12:10.356 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE BECAUSE THIS IS

02:12:08.587 --> 02:12:11.423 region:rollup2
BASICALLY PEOPLE CHANGING THEIR

02:12:10.356 --> 02:12:12.925 region:rollup2
THE SOURCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE

02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:14.460 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S TO AN EMPLOYER

02:12:12.925 --> 02:12:16.195 region:rollup2
MOVING INTO THE MARKETPLACE OR

02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:17.563 region:rollup2
BECOMING UNINSURED OR MOVING

02:12:16.195 --> 02:12:19.398 region:rollup2
FROM MEDICAID TO OTHER

02:12:17.563 --> 02:12:20.432 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACES ETCETERA. YOU CAN

02:12:19.398 --> 02:12:21.734 region:rollup2
THINK OF THE ADDITIONAL MILLIONS

02:12:20.432 --> 02:12:23.335 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE A YEAR THAT ARE

02:12:21.734 --> 02:12:25.037 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONING BETWEEN ARE THE

02:12:23.335 --> 02:12:26.939 region:rollup2
SAME TYPE OF HEALTH INSURANCE

02:12:25.037 --> 02:12:27.940 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE FOR A WITH THE JOB

02:12:26.939 --> 02:12:29.608 region:rollup2
CHANGE MOVING FROM ONE JOB TO

02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:29.875 region:rollup2
ANOTHER. HAS A COMPLETELY

02:12:29.608 --> 02:12:31.076 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:12:29.875 --> 02:12:32.378 region:rollup2
.

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:33.712 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS

02:12:32.378 --> 02:12:35.981 region:rollup2
FORMULAS IT'S ADDRESS THAT WOULD

02:12:33.712 --> 02:12:39.151 region:rollup2
BE ON TOP OF THIS ONE IN SIX

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:40.486 region:rollup2
NUMBER THAT I'M SHOWING HERE.

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:41.954 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATED USING SOME BACK OF

02:12:40.486 --> 02:12:44.056 region:rollup2
THE ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS THAT

02:12:41.954 --> 02:12:45.257 region:rollup2
FOR HERE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE

02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:46.725 region:rollup2
NEXT TWO YEARS ABOUT ELEVEN

02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:47.493 region:rollup2
MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:49.261 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE THEIR CURRENT SOURCE

02:12:47.493 --> 02:12:50.262 region:rollup2
OF INSURANCE.

02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:51.463 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU BREAK THIS DOWN THAT

02:12:50.262 --> 02:12:53.032 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO

02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:54.600 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE WHO TODAY OUR

02:12:53.032 --> 02:12:55.835 region:rollup2
COVER TO AN EMPLOYER ARE GONNA

02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.536 region:rollup2
TRANSITION OUT OF THAT EMPLOYER

02:12:55.835 --> 02:12:58.938 region:rollup2
SPONSORED COVERAGE IN EITHER

02:12:57.536 --> 02:12:59.505 region:rollup2
GOING TO COVER CALIFORNIA WILL

02:12:58.938 --> 02:13:00.472 region:rollup2
BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE

02:12:59.505 --> 02:13:01.440 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:03.108 region:rollup2
OR BECOME UNINSURED FOR SOME

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:04.443 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME.

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:05.477 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FOUR MILLION WOULD COME

02:13:04.443 --> 02:13:07.546 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM OVER

02:13:05.477 --> 02:13:08.047 region:rollup2
THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND AGAIN GO

02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:10.015 region:rollup2
INTO ONE OF THESE OTHER

02:13:08.047 --> 02:13:11.016 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES.

02:13:10.015 --> 02:13:12.117 region:rollup2
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND.

02:13:11.016 --> 02:13:13.719 region:rollup2
WOULD COME OUT OF.

02:13:12.117 --> 02:13:15.554 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CURRENTLY IN THE COVER

02:13:13.719 --> 02:13:16.555 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIAN A MARKETPLACE PLAN

02:13:15.554 --> 02:13:18.123 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THAT

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:19.792 region:rollup2
COVERAGE AND IT'S ESTIMATED BY

02:13:18.123 --> 02:13:21.060 region:rollup2
COVER CALIFORNIA. THAT EVERY

02:13:19.792 --> 02:13:23.028 region:rollup2
MONTH ROUGHLY FIVE TO TEN

02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:27.399 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PEOPLE MOVE BETWEEN

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:28.634 region:rollup2
COVERED CALIFORNIA AND MEDICAL.

02:13:27.399 --> 02:13:29.902 region:rollup2
I WANT TO KIND OF SET A BACKDROP

02:13:28.634 --> 02:13:31.971 region:rollup2
BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT

02:13:29.902 --> 02:13:34.073 region:rollup2
OF THE ACA ON COVERAGE TURN AND

02:13:31.971 --> 02:13:35.674 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD. ON BY DISCUSSING

02:13:34.073 --> 02:13:37.142 region:rollup2
WHY IT IS WE'RE SEEING MORE AND

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:39.845 region:rollup2
MORE TRANSITION OR TURN OVER IN

02:13:37.142 --> 02:13:41.614 region:rollup2
THE U. S. HEALTH INSURANCE.

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:43.115 region:rollup2
ONE KEY FACT ON THE CONTRIBUTES

02:13:41.614 --> 02:13:44.884 region:rollup2
TO THIS IS THE FACT THAT ARE IN.

02:13:43.115 --> 02:13:47.353 region:rollup2
THE THE U. S. HEALTH INSURANCE

02:13:44.884 --> 02:13:48.320 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WELL FRAGMENTED IS BUILT

02:13:47.353 --> 02:13:50.656 region:rollup2
ON THE CHASSIS OF EMPLOYMENT

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:51.257 region:rollup2
BASE TO HEALTH AND.

02:13:50.656 --> 02:13:52.791 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE

02:13:51.257 --> 02:13:54.193 region:rollup2
LAST TWENTY YEARS IS A GRADUAL

02:13:52.791 --> 02:13:56.161 region:rollup2
EROSION OF EMPLOYMENT BASED

02:13:54.193 --> 02:13:57.296 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE.

02:13:56.161 --> 02:13:58.764 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SEE ON THIS GRAPH IS

02:13:57.296 --> 02:14:00.499 region:rollup2
THE BIT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO

02:13:58.764 --> 02:14:02.067 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE.

02:14:00.499 --> 02:14:04.169 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS OF NON ELDERLY AND.

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:06.071 region:rollup2
POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES

02:14:04.169 --> 02:14:07.606 region:rollup2
WAS INSURED THROUGH AN EMPLOYER.

02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:08.807 region:rollup2
BY TWENTY FOURTEEN ON THE EVE OF

02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:09.742 region:rollup2
THE COVERAGE EXPANSIONS ON OF

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:11.043 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT

02:14:09.742 --> 02:14:12.077 region:rollup2
NUMBER HAD GONE FROM SIXTY SEVEN

02:14:11.043 --> 02:14:13.612 region:rollup2
PERCENT. DOWN TO FIFTY SIX

02:14:12.077 --> 02:14:15.281 region:rollup2
PERCENT

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:16.415 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OUR

02:14:15.281 --> 02:14:17.783 region:rollup2
SUMS SLIDES THAT LARRY LEVITT

02:14:16.415 --> 02:14:19.785 region:rollup2
SHOWED EARLIER SHOW THAT IN

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:21.253 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT FIFTY SIX OF THE

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:22.588 region:rollup2
NATIONAL AMBER CALIFORNIA'S

02:14:21.253 --> 02:14:25.357 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT AT LOWER THAN THAT OF

02:14:22.588 --> 02:14:27.826 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE FORTY EIGHT PERCENT.

02:14:25.357 --> 02:14:29.028 region:rollup2
SO.

02:14:27.826 --> 02:14:30.496 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE REASONS ARE

02:14:29.028 --> 02:14:32.264 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS

02:14:30.496 --> 02:14:33.766 region:rollup2
EROSION OF ON OF OF A PLAN IN

02:14:32.264 --> 02:14:35.067 region:rollup2
PLACE INSURANCE?

02:14:33.766 --> 02:14:36.168 region:rollup2
ONE IS THE FACT THAT EMPLOYERS

02:14:35.067 --> 02:14:37.703 region:rollup2
ARE LARGELY STARTING TO GET OUT

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:38.771 region:rollup2
OF THE GAME. AS RISING

02:14:37.703 --> 02:14:40.806 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE COSTS TO PUT THE

02:14:38.771 --> 02:14:42.274 region:rollup2
PINCH ON THEM THEY JUST DECIDED

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:43.208 region:rollup2
THAT OFFERING HEALTH INSURANCE

02:14:42.274 --> 02:14:44.376 region:rollup2
IS A FORM OF COMPENSATION IS

02:14:43.208 --> 02:14:46.111 region:rollup2
JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN NO

02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:47.479 region:rollup2
LONGER AFFORD AND SO ARE MORE

02:14:46.111 --> 02:14:48.581 region:rollup2
AND MORE EMPLOYERS ARE DECIDING

02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:50.749 region:rollup2
NOT TO OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE

02:14:48.581 --> 02:14:52.685 region:rollup2
BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES.

02:14:50.749 --> 02:14:53.986 region:rollup2
ANOTHER REASON IS MOBILITY IN

02:14:52.685 --> 02:14:55.421 region:rollup2
THE U. S. OUR LABOR MARKET

02:14:53.986 --> 02:14:57.122 region:rollup2
WHEREAS ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS

02:14:55.421 --> 02:14:58.958 region:rollup2
AGO AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT HAVE TWO

02:14:57.122 --> 02:15:00.526 region:rollup2
OR THREE JOBS OVER THE COURSE OF

02:14:58.958 --> 02:15:02.161 region:rollup2
THEIR LIFETIME. NOWADAYS IT'S

02:15:00.526 --> 02:15:04.163 region:rollup2
NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE EIGHT NINE

02:15:02.161 --> 02:15:05.230 region:rollup2
TEN JOB CHANGES OVER.

02:15:04.163 --> 02:15:07.633 region:rollup2
OVER YOUR WORKING.

02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:09.001 region:rollup2
LIFE YEARS AND SO WITH THAT

02:15:07.633 --> 02:15:10.369 region:rollup2
COMES CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT YOU

02:15:09.001 --> 02:15:12.271 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE OUT OF A JOB FOR A FEW

02:15:10.369 --> 02:15:14.039 region:rollup2
MONTHS OR AYE IN A WAITING

02:15:12.271 --> 02:15:15.641 region:rollup2
PERIOD IF YOU STARTED A NEW JOB

02:15:14.039 --> 02:15:17.443 region:rollup2
IN CANTON ROLE FOR ANOTHER.

02:15:15.641 --> 02:15:19.511 region:rollup2
A FEW MONTHS.

02:15:17.443 --> 02:15:21.146 region:rollup2
WANTS THAT JOB STARTS.

02:15:19.511 --> 02:15:22.815 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:24.850 region:rollup2
THE SO CALLED GET ECONOMY IN

02:15:22.815 --> 02:15:26.652 region:rollup2
JUST THE RISE OF THE OF THE USE

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:27.886 region:rollup2
OF CONTINGENT* R. ARE.

02:15:26.652 --> 02:15:30.122 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED WORKERS.

02:15:27.886 --> 02:15:31.490 region:rollup2
AND SO IN THAT CASE THOSE ARE

02:15:30.122 --> 02:15:32.358 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD HAVE TO

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:33.892 region:rollup2
GO OUT AND PURCHASE COVERAGE ON

02:15:32.358 --> 02:15:34.727 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER

02:15:33.892 --> 02:15:36.161 region:rollup2
CONTRACT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY

02:15:34.727 --> 02:15:36.729 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE OF A FIRM THAT WOULD

02:15:36.161 --> 02:15:39.665 region:rollup2
OFFER THEM HEALTH INSURANCE

02:15:36.729 --> 02:15:40.799 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

02:15:39.665 --> 02:15:42.134 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR RESEARCH

02:15:40.799 --> 02:15:43.669 region:rollup2
IS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT

02:15:42.134 --> 02:15:46.071 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE.

02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:47.239 region:rollup2
POLICY THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER

02:15:46.071 --> 02:15:48.741 region:rollup2
ABOUT A QUARTER OF THEM ARE

02:15:47.239 --> 02:15:50.876 region:rollup2
GOING TO TRANSITION OFF OF THAT

02:15:48.741 --> 02:15:51.877 region:rollup2
POLICY OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

02:15:50.876 --> 02:15:52.444 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A RISE OF ABOUT TEN

02:15:51.877 --> 02:15:54.113 region:rollup2
PERCENT SINCE THE EARLY TWO

02:15:52.444 --> 02:15:54.913 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS

02:15:54.113 --> 02:15:56.181 region:rollup2
SO THAT COULD EITHER MEAN

02:15:54.913 --> 02:15:57.583 region:rollup2
BECOMING UNINSURED ARE GOING

02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:58.550 region:rollup2
INTO DIFFERENT COVER SITE OR

02:15:57.583 --> 02:16:00.519 region:rollup2
COULD MEAN JUST SIMPLY SWITCHING

02:15:58.550 --> 02:16:01.020 region:rollup2
PLANS. GOING TO NEW JOB WITH

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:02.855 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT BASED HEALTH

02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:04.356 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

02:16:02.855 --> 02:16:05.858 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION GROUPS THAT ARE

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:07.426 region:rollup2
MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE THIS

02:16:05.858 --> 02:16:08.994 region:rollup2
TYPE OF CHURN PERHAPS NOT

02:16:07.426 --> 02:16:11.697 region:rollup2
SURPRISINGLY YOUNG ADULTS LOW

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:13.332 region:rollup2
INCOME ADULTS HISPANIC ADULTS.

02:16:11.697 --> 02:16:14.867 region:rollup2
MORE SURPRISINGLY TO US ADULTS

02:16:13.332 --> 02:16:16.268 region:rollup2
IN FAIR POOR HEALTH ARE MORE

02:16:14.867 --> 02:16:17.703 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE TRANSITIONS

02:16:16.268 --> 02:16:19.905 region:rollup2
OF COVERAGE AND SERVICE INDUSTRY

02:16:17.703 --> 02:16:20.939 region:rollup2
WORKERS AS WELL.

02:16:19.905 --> 02:16:22.174 region:rollup2
THOSE LESS LIKELY TURN

02:16:20.939 --> 02:16:24.243 region:rollup2
TRANSITION ARE OLDER ADULTS

02:16:22.174 --> 02:16:26.211 region:rollup2
MARRIED ADULTS FEMALES AND

02:16:24.243 --> 02:16:26.745 region:rollup2
ADULTS WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE

02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:27.980 region:rollup2
VOWED MENTIONED THAT THESE

02:16:26.745 --> 02:16:28.981 region:rollup2
ADULTS.

02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:30.349 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE LOWER

02:16:28.981 --> 02:16:31.850 region:rollup2
TRANSITION RATES STILL

02:16:30.349 --> 02:16:32.951 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE COVERAGE TRANSITIONS

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:34.319 region:rollup2
ON THE ORDER OF ONE IN FIVE OR

02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:35.487 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OVER A TWO YEAR

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:36.655 region:rollup2
PERIOD SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE

02:16:35.487 --> 02:16:38.157 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE STAYING

02:16:36.655 --> 02:16:42.461 region:rollup2
IN COVERAGE FOR LONG PERIODS OF

02:16:38.157 --> 02:16:43.962 region:rollup2
TIME RELATIVE TO THESE OTHER.

02:16:42.461 --> 02:16:45.330 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOUND ALSO IS THAT

02:16:43.962 --> 02:16:47.499 region:rollup2
LEADING INTO THE PERIOD?

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:49.068 region:rollup2
OF THE ACA.

02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:50.202 region:rollup2
ONE MITIGATING FACTOR KEEPING A

02:16:49.068 --> 02:16:51.870 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM

02:16:50.202 --> 02:16:53.338 region:rollup2
BECOMING UNINSURED.

02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:54.940 region:rollup2
WAS THAT INCREASE AMERICANS ARE

02:16:53.338 --> 02:16:56.508 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY RELIANT WHEN THEY

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:58.677 region:rollup2
LOSE A JOB WITH HEALTH INSURANCE

02:16:56.508 --> 02:16:59.812 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ON OBTAINING A COVERAGE

02:16:58.677 --> 02:17:01.447 region:rollup2
THROUGH A FAMILY MEMBER. WHO

02:16:59.812 --> 02:17:03.348 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES HAS A JOB WITH HEALTH

02:17:01.447 --> 02:17:04.717 region:rollup2
INSURANCE BENEFIT?

02:17:03.348 --> 02:17:06.151 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT FROM

02:17:04.717 --> 02:17:07.753 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FORTY TWO THOUSAND

02:17:06.151 --> 02:17:08.821 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A

02:17:07.753 --> 02:17:09.922 region:rollup2
POP THAT SOMEBODY WITH THE

02:17:08.821 --> 02:17:11.690 region:rollup2
POLICY AND EMPLOYMENT BASE

02:17:09.922 --> 02:17:12.658 region:rollup2
POLICY.

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:13.425 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO FIND A NEW JOB WITH

02:17:12.658 --> 02:17:15.894 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS WENT

02:17:13.425 --> 02:17:17.729 region:rollup2
DOWN BY FIFTEEN PER SE.

02:17:15.894 --> 02:17:19.465 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THE PROBABILITY

02:17:17.729 --> 02:17:20.399 region:rollup2
THAT THAT POLICY HOLDER. WAS

02:17:19.465 --> 02:17:22.134 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET COVERAGE THROUGH A

02:17:20.399 --> 02:17:24.870 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBER AFTER THAT JOB

02:17:22.134 --> 02:17:26.038 region:rollup2
CHANGE INCREASE TO FULL.

02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:26.538 region:rollup2
NOW EMPLOYERS HAVE REALIZE THIS

02:17:26.038 --> 02:17:27.573 region:rollup2
AND THEY'VE INCREASINGLY

02:17:26.538 --> 02:17:29.508 region:rollup2
STARTED.

02:17:27.573 --> 02:17:31.043 region:rollup2
IMPOSING SURCHARGES MAKING IT

02:17:29.508 --> 02:17:32.778 region:rollup2
MORE EXPENSIVE FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:17:31.043 --> 02:17:34.413 region:rollup2
TO COVER FAMILY MEMBERS OR IN

02:17:32.778 --> 02:17:35.447 region:rollup2
MANY CASES RETIREES WE CERTAINLY

02:17:34.413 --> 02:17:36.682 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT A VANDERBILT.

02:17:35.447 --> 02:17:38.117 region:rollup2
MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE

02:17:36.682 --> 02:17:41.920 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES THAT ARE IN YOUR

02:17:38.117 --> 02:17:43.088 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AS WELL.

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.255 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT BACKS UP I'D LIKE

02:17:43.088 --> 02:17:44.523 region:rollup2
TO.

02:17:43.255 --> 02:17:46.959 region:rollup2
.

02:17:44.523 --> 02:17:48.026 region:rollup2
TO DISCUSS THE ACA AND ITS ROLE

02:17:46.959 --> 02:17:50.195 region:rollup2
IN AFFECTING COVERAGE TURN IN

02:17:48.026 --> 02:17:51.663 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES.

02:17:50.195 --> 02:17:53.298 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TAKE AWAY FROM R. WORK

02:17:51.663 --> 02:17:54.800 region:rollup2
IS THAT OVERALL CHURN RATES HAVE

02:17:53.298 --> 02:17:57.302 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY CHANGED MUCH WITH THE

02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:59.104 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN PLACE.

02:17:57.302 --> 02:18:00.539 region:rollup2
NO WELL OVERALL CHURN RATES HAVE

02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:02.141 region:rollup2
BEEN HAVE BEEN CHANGED

02:18:00.539 --> 02:18:04.042 region:rollup2
THE NATURE OF THOSE THAT TURNED

02:18:02.141 --> 02:18:05.244 region:rollup2
HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT.

02:18:04.042 --> 02:18:06.945 region:rollup2
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE'RE

02:18:05.244 --> 02:18:08.714 region:rollup2
SEEING INCREASED RETENTION

02:18:06.945 --> 02:18:09.815 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAL?

02:18:08.714 --> 02:18:11.283 region:rollup2
AND FEWER PEOPLE BECOMING

02:18:09.815 --> 02:18:12.618 region:rollup2
UNINSURED SO THESE TRANSITIONS

02:18:11.283 --> 02:18:14.386 region:rollup2
FROM INSURANCE TO UNINSURED

02:18:12.618 --> 02:18:15.687 region:rollup2
STATUS AREBECOMING LESS

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:16.622 region:rollup2
PREVALENT OVER TIME.

02:18:15.687 --> 02:18:19.224 region:rollup2
IN IN THE WAKE OF THE

02:18:16.622 --> 02:18:20.425 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:22.294 region:rollup2
THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:23.595 region:rollup2
IS WELL IS THAT UNDER THE

02:18:22.294 --> 02:18:25.164 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AMEND

02:18:23.595 --> 02:18:26.932 region:rollup2
AMERICANS ARE SPENDING LESS TIME

02:18:25.164 --> 02:18:27.866 region:rollup2
BEING ON ENSURE.

02:18:26.932 --> 02:18:29.101 region:rollup2
IT'S THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS

02:18:27.866 --> 02:18:29.668 region:rollup2
IS TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE

02:18:29.101 --> 02:18:35.107 region:rollup2
UNINSURED PEOPLE TODAY THAT

02:18:29.668 --> 02:18:36.175 region:rollup2
OFTEN BECOME UNINSURED AT

02:18:35.107 --> 02:18:38.544 region:rollup2
VARIOUS POINTS IN TIME SOME

02:18:36.175 --> 02:18:40.212 region:rollup2
WALKS EXIT SOONER THAN OTHERS.

02:18:38.544 --> 02:18:41.647 region:rollup2
A LOT SOME PEOPLE SPEND A LOT

02:18:40.212 --> 02:18:41.847 region:rollup2
OF TIME ON THIS HIGHWAY BEFORE

02:18:41.647 --> 02:18:43.949 region:rollup2
THEY.

02:18:41.847 --> 02:18:44.483 region:rollup2
TEAM COVERAGE.

02:18:43.949 --> 02:18:45.884 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE SEEN UNDER THE

02:18:44.483 --> 02:18:46.952 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS THAT MORE

02:18:45.884 --> 02:18:48.420 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE GETTING OFF THE EXIT

02:18:46.952 --> 02:18:49.922 region:rollup2
SOONER?

02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:51.190 region:rollup2
INTO THINGS LIKE NON GROUP

02:18:49.922 --> 02:18:52.524 region:rollup2
COVERAGE LIKE OUT TO COVER

02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:53.592 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THE MARKETPLACES

02:18:52.524 --> 02:18:54.726 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:18:53.592 --> 02:18:56.395 region:rollup2
THE RED LINE IN THE BLUE LINE

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:57.496 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT JUMP. THAT RED LINE

02:18:56.395 --> 02:18:58.831 region:rollup2
WAS THE TWO YEARS PRIOR TO THE

02:18:57.496 --> 02:18:59.965 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

02:18:58.831 --> 02:19:01.200 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THESE

02:18:59.965 --> 02:19:03.302 region:rollup2
CARS EXITING THE HIGHWAY FROM

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:04.770 region:rollup2
UNINSURED STATUS INTO THE MARKET

02:19:03.302 --> 02:19:05.837 region:rollup2
PLACES AND THE BLUE LINE IS THAT

02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:09.508 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS FOLLOWING THE

02:19:05.837 --> 02:19:10.242 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S COVERAGE.

02:19:09.508 --> 02:19:12.311 region:rollup2
LIKEWISE WE'VE SEEN THE SAME

02:19:10.242 --> 02:19:13.545 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC WITH MORE PEOPLE THAT

02:19:12.311 --> 02:19:15.347 region:rollup2
WERE UNINSURED OBTAINING.

02:19:13.545 --> 02:19:17.282 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COVERAGE.

02:19:15.347 --> 02:19:19.384 region:rollup2
SOONER.

02:19:17.282 --> 02:19:20.586 region:rollup2
IN IN PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE

02:19:19.384 --> 02:19:22.454 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

02:19:20.586 --> 02:19:24.523 region:rollup2
RED LINE BEING THE PRE ACA LINE

02:19:22.454 --> 02:19:28.260 region:rollup2
AND THE BLUE LINE BEING.

02:19:24.523 --> 02:19:28.994 region:rollup2
POST A CA LINE.

02:19:28.260 --> 02:19:30.495 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO OTHER THOUGHT

02:19:28.994 --> 02:19:31.830 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS THAT A CHANGE WITH THE

02:19:30.495 --> 02:19:32.397 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE OR NOT CHANGED WITH

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:33.832 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT I SHOULD

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:36.134 region:rollup2
SAY.

02:19:33.832 --> 02:19:37.736 region:rollup2
ONE CONCERN OF A EXPANSIONS A

02:19:36.134 --> 02:19:39.371 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COURAGEOUS IS THAT THERE

02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:41.607 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE INDIVIDUALS THAT

02:19:39.371 --> 02:19:43.675 region:rollup2
HAVE AYE. TO EMPLOYER BASED

02:19:41.607 --> 02:19:45.544 region:rollup2
OFFER OF INSURANCE BUT WHO ALSO

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:47.112 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOME WOULD BE

02:19:45.544 --> 02:19:48.280 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR THAT PUBLIC OPTION

02:19:47.112 --> 02:19:48.847 region:rollup2
IT FOR THAT PUBLIC PUBLIC

02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:49.881 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN WOULD TAKE IT UP

02:19:48.847 --> 02:19:51.383 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP.

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.384 region:rollup2
THIS IS KNOWN AS CROWD OUT THE

02:19:51.383 --> 02:19:52.651 region:rollup2
IDEA BEING THAT.

02:19:52.384 --> 02:19:54.820 region:rollup2
ITS IT'S.

02:19:52.651 --> 02:19:55.921 region:rollup2
.

02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:57.789 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOUR UTILIZING TAX

02:19:55.921 --> 02:19:58.523 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO GIVE INDIVIDUALS

02:19:57.789 --> 02:20:00.125 region:rollup2
COVERAGE THAT WOULD HAVE

02:19:58.523 --> 02:20:01.093 region:rollup2
COVERAGE THROUGH AN EMPLOYER THE

02:20:00.125 --> 02:20:02.895 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR WOULD A PROVIDED

02:20:01.093 --> 02:20:05.297 region:rollup2
THEM ANYWAY SO TO COVER ALL OF

02:20:02.895 --> 02:20:07.032 region:rollup2
THE UNINSURED. IT TAKES MORE.

02:20:05.297 --> 02:20:08.267 region:rollup2
IT TAKES MORE THAN JUST

02:20:07.032 --> 02:20:10.335 region:rollup2
COVERING THOSE UNINSURED BECAUSE

02:20:08.267 --> 02:20:10.869 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE INDIVIDUALS

02:20:10.335 --> 02:20:12.304 region:rollup2
THAT COULD HAVE GOTTEN AYE

02:20:10.869 --> 02:20:13.672 region:rollup2
COVERAGE ELSEWHERE ON THE PRICE.

02:20:12.304 --> 02:20:15.440 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN IN THIS

02:20:13.672 --> 02:20:16.575 region:rollup2
WAS A CONCERN A WITH ANY

02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:18.477 region:rollup2
COVERAGE EXPANSION LET ALONE

02:20:16.575 --> 02:20:20.279 region:rollup2
JUST THE ACA? IS THAT THEY'RE

02:20:18.477 --> 02:20:21.914 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS NOT BEEN VERY MUCH

02:20:20.279 --> 02:20:23.649 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE OF THIS CROWD OUT WITH

02:20:21.914 --> 02:20:27.019 region:rollup2
THE IN PARTICULAR EXPANSES OF

02:20:23.649 --> 02:20:29.021 region:rollup2
MEDICAID TO LOWER INCOME ADULTS.

02:20:27.019 --> 02:20:30.122 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DYNAMIC WE'VE SEEN.

02:20:29.021 --> 02:20:31.690 region:rollup2
IS THAT TRANSITIONS FROM

02:20:30.122 --> 02:20:32.224 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE TO

02:20:31.690 --> 02:20:33.759 region:rollup2
UNINSURED STATUS HAVE NOT

02:20:32.224 --> 02:20:34.559 region:rollup2
CHANGED.

02:20:33.759 --> 02:20:35.894 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:37.596 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LOSING

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:39.031 region:rollup2
THEIR PLAYER BASE POLICIES FOR

02:20:37.596 --> 02:20:40.399 region:rollup2
WHATEVER REASON WHETHER THEY

02:20:39.031 --> 02:20:41.199 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT WHETHER THE

02:20:40.399 --> 02:20:42.701 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES ON AND OFF?

02:20:41.199 --> 02:20:44.403 region:rollup2
?

02:20:42.701 --> 02:20:47.272 region:rollup2
OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE JUST

02:20:44.403 --> 02:20:48.607 region:rollup2
NOT FINDING THE MARKET PLACES OR

02:20:47.272 --> 02:20:49.775 region:rollup2
EVEN PUBLIC COVERAGE AN

02:20:48.607 --> 02:20:54.346 region:rollup2
ATTRACTIVE OFFER TO THEM AND

02:20:49.775 --> 02:20:55.714 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEEN A SURPRISE TO US.

02:20:54.346 --> 02:20:56.715 region:rollup2
I LIKE TO SPEND A COUPLE MINUTES

02:20:55.714 --> 02:20:58.951 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES

02:20:56.715 --> 02:21:01.119 region:rollup2
OF HAVING SET THE STAGE FOR HOW

02:20:58.951 --> 02:21:02.287 region:rollup2
MUCH TURN THERE'S AN ASSIST.

02:21:01.119 --> 02:21:03.455 region:rollup2
SOME RESEARCH FROM OTHERS ARE

02:21:02.287 --> 02:21:05.023 region:rollup2
CALLING UP AT HARVARD PUBLISHED

02:21:03.455 --> 02:21:06.825 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR.

02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:07.960 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE

02:21:06.825 --> 02:21:09.928 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONING OFF OF PRIVATE

02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:11.263 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:12.597 region:rollup2
THEIR UTILIZATION OF PRIMARY

02:21:11.263 --> 02:21:13.899 region:rollup2
CARE SERVICES WENT UP FORTY

02:21:12.597 --> 02:21:14.967 region:rollup2
SEVEN PERCENT IN THE MONTHS

02:21:13.899 --> 02:21:17.035 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THAT TRANSITION FROM A

02:21:14.967 --> 02:21:17.903 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PLAN.

02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:19.271 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

02:21:17.903 --> 02:21:20.706 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONING OFF OF MEDICAID

02:21:19.271 --> 02:21:21.306 region:rollup2
THEIR PRIMARY CARE UTILIZATION

02:21:20.706 --> 02:21:22.774 region:rollup2
WENT UP TWO HUNDRED AND THREE

02:21:21.306 --> 02:21:23.575 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:21:22.774 --> 02:21:25.744 region:rollup2
AND THEN LEVELED OFF EVENTUALLY

02:21:23.575 --> 02:21:27.846 region:rollup2
OVER TIME.

02:21:25.744 --> 02:21:28.847 region:rollup2
EDIE VISITS AMONG THOSE A

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:31.016 region:rollup2
SWITCHING OFF OF THE MEDICAID

02:21:28.847 --> 02:21:32.484 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHAT FIFTEEN PER.

02:21:31.016 --> 02:21:33.952 region:rollup2
AND THIS SPEAKS TO OUR A COMMON

02:21:32.484 --> 02:21:34.853 region:rollup2
THEME THAT WE HEARD TODAY.

02:21:33.952 --> 02:21:36.521 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT AS YOU'RE

02:21:34.853 --> 02:21:37.756 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONING FROM ONE PLANT TO

02:21:36.521 --> 02:21:39.257 region:rollup2
ANOTHER A ONE PLAN TO UNANSWERED

02:21:37.756 --> 02:21:40.492 region:rollup2
STATUS.

02:21:39.257 --> 02:21:41.994 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT ONLY ADMINISTRATIVE

02:21:40.492 --> 02:21:42.861 region:rollup2
COSTS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT

02:21:41.994 --> 02:21:44.463 region:rollup2
BUT CHANGES IN BENEFITS

02:21:42.861 --> 02:21:45.764 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE CHANGES AND PROVIDER

02:21:44.463 --> 02:21:47.332 region:rollup2
NETWORKS AND THAT'S REALLY

02:21:45.764 --> 02:21:49.368 region:rollup2
PLAYING OUT INTO HAVING TO

02:21:47.332 --> 02:21:51.069 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH. REALLY REESTABLISH

02:21:49.368 --> 02:21:52.537 region:rollup2
CARE RELATIONSHIPS IN A NEW PLAN

02:21:51.069 --> 02:21:54.873 region:rollup2
WITH A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IN

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:56.942 region:rollup2
THIS CASE OR JUST NOT BEING ABLE

02:21:54.873 --> 02:21:59.044 region:rollup2
TO QUICKLY NAVIGATE THIS NEW

02:21:56.942 --> 02:22:01.079 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE.

02:21:59.044 --> 02:22:03.115 region:rollup2
THAT YOU YOU'RE IN WHEN YOU

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:04.583 region:rollup2
WEEDS FOR EXAMPLE TRANSITION OFF

02:22:03.115 --> 02:22:06.151 region:rollup2
OF MEDICAID AND JUST SHOWING UP

02:22:04.583 --> 02:22:08.086 region:rollup2
IN THE E. D. BECAUSE IT'S A

02:22:06.151 --> 02:22:09.955 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT EASIER THAN FINDING.

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:10.989 region:rollup2
A AN APPOINTMENT.

02:22:09.955 --> 02:22:12.624 region:rollup2
ONE STRATEGY THAT.

02:22:10.989 --> 02:22:14.192 region:rollup2
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT

02:22:12.624 --> 02:22:16.428 region:rollup2
THAT INSURERS ARE INCREASINGLY

02:22:14.192 --> 02:22:17.996 region:rollup2
TURNING TO AS A WAY TO SAVE ON

02:22:16.428 --> 02:22:19.031 region:rollup2
BOB PLAYING POSSUM PREMIUMS

02:22:17.996 --> 02:22:20.565 region:rollup2
ASSIST TO TURNING TO NARROW

02:22:19.031 --> 02:22:21.666 region:rollup2
NETWORKS AND AGAIN THIS IS GONNA

02:22:20.565 --> 02:22:23.135 region:rollup2
ACT OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE

02:22:21.666 --> 02:22:25.137 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS SLIDE. BUT RESEARCHERS

02:22:23.135 --> 02:22:27.139 region:rollup2
FOUND IS THAT EVEN.

02:22:25.137 --> 02:22:28.507 region:rollup2
THAT NEVER NETWORKS CAN SAVE

02:22:27.139 --> 02:22:29.608 region:rollup2
THE CAN LOWER PREMIUM COSTS

02:22:28.507 --> 02:22:30.909 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

02:22:29.608 --> 02:22:32.310 region:rollup2
BUT ALL OF THE SAVINGS ARE

02:22:30.909 --> 02:22:33.512 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATED AMONG PEOPLE WHO

02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:34.079 region:rollup2
ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR

02:22:33.512 --> 02:22:36.248 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AFTER

02:22:34.079 --> 02:22:37.783 region:rollup2
THEIR SWEAT.

02:22:36.248 --> 02:22:39.518 region:rollup2
AGAIN SPEAKING TO THESE ISSUES

02:22:37.783 --> 02:22:40.819 region:rollup2
OF OF INCREASE UTILIZATION AS

02:22:39.518 --> 02:22:43.021 region:rollup2
PEOPLE RE NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM

02:22:40.819 --> 02:22:44.489 region:rollup2
UNDER A NEW PLAN.

02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:46.058 region:rollup2
ONE SURVEY OF INDIVIDUALS ARE

02:22:44.489 --> 02:22:48.527 region:rollup2
CHURNED ENOUGH THREE STATES

02:22:46.058 --> 02:22:50.629 region:rollup2
KENTUCKY ARKANSAS AND TEXAS.

02:22:48.527 --> 02:22:52.364 region:rollup2
SELF REPORTED ARE A THIRD OF

02:22:50.629 --> 02:22:53.465 region:rollup2
THEM SELF REPORTED EITHER

02:22:52.364 --> 02:22:54.266 region:rollup2
SKIPPING DOSES OF THE

02:22:53.465 --> 02:22:55.834 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS ARE STOP TAKING

02:22:54.266 --> 02:22:56.935 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS

02:22:55.834 --> 02:22:58.470 region:rollup2
DURING THE PERIOD WHERE THEY

02:22:56.935 --> 02:22:59.538 region:rollup2
EITHER DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE. OR

02:22:58.470 --> 02:23:00.972 region:rollup2
IN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN PERCENT

02:22:59.538 --> 02:23:06.578 region:rollup2
HAD TO CHANGE THEIR MEDICATIONS

02:23:00.972 --> 02:23:07.879 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF CHANGES THAT FORMULA.

02:23:06.578 --> 02:23:09.581 region:rollup2
JOHN IS VERY IMPORTANT.

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:10.048 region:rollup2
AS WE IN PARTICULAR AS WE THINK

02:23:09.581 --> 02:23:12.150 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:14.786 region:rollup2
COVERAGE PROVIDED TO THE MARKET

02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:15.387 region:rollup2
PLACES I IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACT

02:23:14.786 --> 02:23:16.988 region:rollup2
ON ACCESS TO AND CONTINUITY OF

02:23:15.387 --> 02:23:18.423 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:23:16.988 --> 02:23:19.424 region:rollup2
ONE DYNAMIC THAT HAS BEEN I

02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:20.859 region:rollup2
THINK A LITTLE BIT UNDER

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:22.427 region:rollup2
REPORTED IS THAT MANY

02:23:20.859 --> 02:23:24.396 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE PLANS OFFER VERY

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:25.497 region:rollup2
LITTLE OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE.

02:23:24.396 --> 02:23:27.165 region:rollup2
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL OF

02:23:25.497 --> 02:23:28.733 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS PUT IN

02:23:27.165 --> 02:23:29.301 region:rollup2
PLACE BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

02:23:28.733 --> 02:23:31.803 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S.

02:23:29.301 --> 02:23:33.972 region:rollup2
THE ELIMINATION OF LIFETIME A

FINANCIAL PROTECTION VIGT THAT

02:23:38.143 --> 02:23:41.246 region:rollup2
THE ACA PUT IN PLACE.

02:23:39.611 --> 02:23:41.813 region:rollup2
DO NOT APPLY TO ANY CARE

02:23:41.246 --> 02:23:43.849 region:rollup2
RECEIVED OUT OF THAT WORK IN

YOUR PLAN.

02:23:43.849 --> 02:23:48.286 region:rollup2
SO WHAT YOU SEE IS AND THIS.

02:23:45.917 --> 02:23:49.688 region:rollup2
PLOT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:51.056 region:rollup2
THE TOP ONE IS FOR PRIMARY CARE

02:23:49.688 --> 02:23:53.358 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE PERCENTAGE OF SILVER

WHATEVER THEY CHARGED YOU IT WAS

02:24:14.412 --> 02:24:18.049 region:rollup2
NOT CONSIDERED AN THAT WORK.

02:24:16.948 --> 02:24:19.184 region:rollup2
WITH YOUR EAR PLAN WOULD NOT

COVER SOME PORTION OF IT.

02:24:19.184 --> 02:24:21.153 region:rollup2
BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THESE NUMBERS

02:24:20.485 --> 02:24:22.787 region:rollup2
ROSE FROM.

SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU

02:24:37.435 --> 02:24:40.539 region:rollup2
TRANSITION FROM ONE PLAN TO

02:24:46.344 --> 02:24:51.049 region:rollup2
PROTECTING YOU FROM WHATEVER

02:24:47.579 --> 02:24:51.917 region:rollup2
COSTS THOSE NEIGHBORING.

02:24:51.049 --> 02:24:53.585 region:rollup2
THE OTHER DYNAMIC THAT I'D

02:24:51.917 --> 02:24:54.786 region:rollup2
REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT

02:24:53.585 --> 02:24:56.321 region:rollup2
MANY OF US WHO ARE INSURED

02:24:54.786 --> 02:24:58.156 region:rollup2
THROUGH AN EMPLOYER HAVE ACCESS

02:24:56.321 --> 02:25:00.125 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDER NETWORKS WITH A VERY

02:24:58.156 --> 02:25:01.993 region:rollup2
BROAD BROAD FOOTPRINT.

02:25:00.125 --> 02:25:03.728 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS GENERALLY TEND TO PICK

02:25:01.993 --> 02:25:05.430 region:rollup2
PLAY OR OFFER PLANS THAT HAVE A

02:25:03.728 --> 02:25:07.399 region:rollup2
WIDE PROVIDER FOOT PRINT.

02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:08.733 region:rollup2
TO OFFER AS MANY CHOICES TO

02:25:07.399 --> 02:25:11.570 region:rollup2
THERE AND IT TO THEIR.

02:25:08.733 --> 02:25:12.470 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AS POSSIBLE.

02:25:11.570 --> 02:25:13.505 region:rollup2
BUT WHETHER IT'S THE MARKET

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:15.073 region:rollup2
PLACES THROUGH THE RISE OF A

02:25:13.505 --> 02:25:17.475 region:rollup2
NARROW NETWORKS OR EVEN IN THE

02:25:15.073 --> 02:25:18.443 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAM WHERE NETWORKS

02:25:17.475 --> 02:25:19.844 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE NEAR WHERE NOT ONLY

02:25:18.443 --> 02:25:21.446 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY OF THE USE OF

02:25:19.844 --> 02:25:22.280 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT HAVE.

02:25:21.446 --> 02:25:24.282 region:rollup2
MORE RESTRICTED NETWORKS BUT

02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:25.450 region:rollup2
ALSO DUE TO LOWER PARTICIPATION

02:25:24.282 --> 02:25:27.385 region:rollup2
RATES IN MEDICAID RELATIVE TO

02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:29.120 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PLANS.

02:25:27.385 --> 02:25:29.754 region:rollup2
SO THAT THOSE OF US WATCHING OUT

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:30.855 region:rollup2
OF EMPLOYER PLANS AND INTO THESE

02:25:29.754 --> 02:25:31.823 region:rollup2
OTHER.

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:33.258 region:rollup2
PLAN ARE REGION'S WHAT IF YOU

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:34.426 region:rollup2
MEDICAID OR THE MARKET PLACES

02:25:33.258 --> 02:25:36.061 region:rollup2
ARE JUST FINDING MUCH MORE

02:25:34.426 --> 02:25:37.629 region:rollup2
NARROW NETWORKS THAN WHERE YOU

02:25:36.061 --> 02:25:39.431 region:rollup2
STILL AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE.

02:25:37.629 --> 02:25:41.199 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA AMPLIFY OF THE

02:25:39.431 --> 02:25:43.134 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF

02:25:41.199 --> 02:25:45.203 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION AYE COSTS AS AS WE

02:25:43.134 --> 02:25:45.437 region:rollup2
TRY TO RE NAVIGATE A A NEW

02:25:45.203 --> 02:25:46.237 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

02:25:45.437 --> 02:25:48.773 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:49.407 region:rollup2
IN THE WAKE OF THE CHANGE.

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:50.909 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:51.977 region:rollup2
VISUALIZATION IN JUST A MINUTE

02:25:50.909 --> 02:25:53.245 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT TO SET YOU UP FOR

02:25:51.977 --> 02:25:54.679 region:rollup2
THIS. JUST TO SHOW YOU HERE

02:25:53.245 --> 02:25:56.381 region:rollup2
LOCALLY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FOR

02:25:54.679 --> 02:25:57.949 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY CHANGING MARKETPLACE

02:25:56.381 --> 02:25:59.251 region:rollup2
PLANS AND WHAT WOULD. WHAT WOULD

02:25:57.949 --> 02:26:00.885 region:rollup2
MEAN FOR THEIR PRIMARY AND

02:25:59.251 --> 02:26:01.753 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE?

02:26:00.885 --> 02:26:03.588 region:rollup2
YOU CAN THINK OF THIS

02:26:01.753 --> 02:26:04.189 region:rollup2
VISUALIZATION HERE ON THE LEFT

02:26:03.588 --> 02:26:05.357 region:rollup2
IS THIS KIND OF HUB AND SPOKE

02:26:04.189 --> 02:26:07.058 region:rollup2
MODEL OF A OF A PRIMARY CARE

02:26:05.357 --> 02:26:08.360 region:rollup2
NETWORK FURNITURE THE INSURER

02:26:07.058 --> 02:26:09.928 region:rollup2
BEING THERE IN THE MIDDLE. IN

02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:11.596 region:rollup2
VARIOUS PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS

02:26:09.928 --> 02:26:12.964 region:rollup2
IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

02:26:11.596 --> 02:26:14.766 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN THAT WORK FOR THAT

02:26:12.964 --> 02:26:16.668 region:rollup2
PLAN THERE IS THE SPOKES ARE

02:26:14.766 --> 02:26:17.802 region:rollup2
COMING OUT OF THAT HUB.

02:26:16.668 --> 02:26:18.436 region:rollup2
ON THE RIGHT YOU'RE GONNA SEE

02:26:17.802 --> 02:26:20.605 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE

02:26:18.436 --> 02:26:21.139 region:rollup2
FOR HERE IN SACRAMENTO FOR ONE

02:26:20.605 --> 02:26:22.641 region:rollup2
PLAN IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE

02:26:21.139 --> 02:26:24.275 region:rollup2
KAISER.

02:26:22.641 --> 02:26:25.610 region:rollup2
TO YOU CAN SEE THE IN NETWORK

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:27.879 region:rollup2
PCP IS THIS THE SMALL DOTS IN

02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:28.980 region:rollup2
THE ENSURE THERE IN THE MIDDLE.

02:26:27.879 --> 02:26:29.881 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT THE PRIMARY CARE

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:31.216 region:rollup2
NETWORK LOOKS LIKE FOR

02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:33.351 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND TWENTY

02:26:31.216 --> 02:26:34.886 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

02:26:33.351 --> 02:26:35.920 region:rollup2
AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS KAISER

02:26:34.886 --> 02:26:37.589 region:rollup2
THERE'S A STAFF MODEL HMO

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.623 region:rollup2
BASICALLY EXISTING OUTSIDE OF.

02:26:37.589 --> 02:26:40.025 region:rollup2
THE NETWORKS OF THE OTHER

02:26:38.623 --> 02:26:41.259 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

02:26:40.025 --> 02:26:42.727 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU ARE FOR EXAMPLE

02:26:41.259 --> 02:26:44.996 region:rollup2
INSERTED THROUGH SADR WHICH IS

02:26:42.727 --> 02:26:46.631 region:rollup2
HERE ON THE LOWER. LEFT IN YOUR

02:26:44.996 --> 02:26:48.366 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE WAS IN YOUR PRIMARY

02:26:46.631 --> 02:26:49.467 region:rollup2
CARE PHYSICIAN WAS A NETWORK AND

02:26:48.366 --> 02:26:50.835 region:rollup2
YOU WANTED TO SWITCH TO ANY ONE

02:26:49.467 --> 02:26:51.836 region:rollup2
OF THESE PLANTS.

02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:52.804 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT YOU

02:26:51.836 --> 02:26:53.438 region:rollup2
WOULD FIND THE A PRIMARY CARE

02:26:52.804 --> 02:26:55.607 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN WAS IN THAT WORK FOR

02:26:53.438 --> 02:26:57.409 region:rollup2
THOSE OTHER PLANTS.

02:26:55.607 --> 02:26:58.843 region:rollup2
EVEN PLANS OFFERED BY THE SAME

02:26:57.409 --> 02:26:59.477 region:rollup2
ENSURE SUCH AS ANTHEM HERE.

02:26:58.843 --> 02:27:02.614 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

02:26:59.477 --> 02:27:03.581 region:rollup2
PROVIDER NETWORKS.

02:27:02.614 --> 02:27:05.717 region:rollup2
AND IF THIS IS VICENTINA

02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:09.921 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED. THAT'S BECAUSE THIS

02:27:05.717 --> 02:27:11.289 region:rollup2
IS VISENTINI VERY COMPLICATED.

02:27:09.921 --> 02:27:13.925 region:rollup2
SO CHARMED AMONG THE.

02:27:11.289 --> 02:27:15.460 region:rollup2
BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND PLANTS AS

02:27:13.925 --> 02:27:16.828 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PLANNED EXITING AND

02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:18.263 region:rollup2
ENTERING EVERY YEAR PUTS AN ONUS

02:27:16.828 --> 02:27:19.931 region:rollup2
ON REGULATORY AND POLICY

02:27:18.263 --> 02:27:20.432 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TO ENSURE ACCURATE

02:27:19.931 --> 02:27:21.966 region:rollup2
AND ACCESSIBLE PROVIDER

02:27:20.432 --> 02:27:23.168 region:rollup2
NETWORKS.

02:27:21.966 --> 02:27:24.669 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE

02:27:23.168 --> 02:27:26.337 region:rollup2
FACE CHALLENGES FROM THESE THIS

02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:28.173 region:rollup2
TURNOVER IN TURN MATTER WHERE WE

02:27:26.337 --> 02:27:29.107 region:rollup2
GO FOR HERE FROM HERE.

02:27:28.173 --> 02:27:30.775 region:rollup2
AS EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE

02:27:29.107 --> 02:27:32.444 region:rollup2
BECOMES LESS PREVALENT.

02:27:30.775 --> 02:27:34.079 region:rollup2
MORE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO

02:27:32.444 --> 02:27:35.046 region:rollup2
RELY ON COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF

02:27:34.079 --> 02:27:36.381 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT THROUGH THE

02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:37.849 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACES AS THEIR PRIMARY

02:27:36.381 --> 02:27:39.150 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF INSURANCE

02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:40.151 region:rollup2
EITHER THE TRANSITION AREA

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:42.554 region:rollup2
POLICY IS THEY'RE GOING IN

02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:44.856 region:rollup2
BETWEEN JOBS. OR AS A PERMANENT

02:27:42.554 --> 02:27:46.358 region:rollup2
POLICY MOVE FORWARD.

02:27:44.856 --> 02:27:48.827 region:rollup2
ENSURE WITHDRAWALS MEANS THAT

02:27:46.358 --> 02:27:49.627 region:rollup2
MEET PEOPLE MUST SWITCH PLANTS.

02:27:48.827 --> 02:27:51.296 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:52.163 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE

02:27:51.296 --> 02:27:54.032 region:rollup2
CHOOSE A NEW PLAN TO HAVE ONE

02:27:52.163 --> 02:27:55.467 region:rollup2
AUDIO ASSIGNED TO THEM THAT MAY

02:27:54.032 --> 02:27:57.168 region:rollup2
OR MAY NOT HAVE THE SAID THEIR

02:27:55.467 --> 02:27:58.136 region:rollup2
SIDE OF PROVIDERS IN THAT WORK.

02:27:57.168 --> 02:27:58.303 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN IF WE GOT TO THE KIND

02:27:58.136 --> 02:28:00.271 region:rollup2
OF.

02:27:58.303 --> 02:28:01.339 region:rollup2
.

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:02.440 region:rollup2
I DEAL A LEASE IN THE

02:28:01.339 --> 02:28:04.242 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE SENSE OF HAVING A

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:05.110 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE MARKET.

02:28:04.242 --> 02:28:06.311 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA RELY ON PEOPLE

02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:08.613 region:rollup2
SHOPPING AROUND FOR NEW

02:28:06.311 --> 02:28:09.681 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PLAN EVERY YEAR.

02:28:08.613 --> 02:28:11.249 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS PEOPLE

02:28:09.681 --> 02:28:13.718 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE GOOD

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:14.886 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON WHETHER OR NOT

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:16.855 region:rollup2
THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN

02:28:14.886 --> 02:28:17.422 region:rollup2
THEIR CARDIOLOGISTS. OR EVEN

02:28:16.855 --> 02:28:19.290 region:rollup2
JUST A.

02:28:17.422 --> 02:28:21.126 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL THAT THEY MAY OR MAY

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:23.395 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE EVER USED IS IN THAT

02:28:21.126 --> 02:28:24.462 region:rollup2
WORK IN ONE PLAN VERSUS ANOTHER.

02:28:23.395 --> 02:28:25.430 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE COMMON THREAD

02:28:24.462 --> 02:28:27.132 region:rollup2
RUNNING THROUGH ALL OF THE

02:28:25.430 --> 02:28:29.234 region:rollup2
POLICY SOLUTIONS TO THIS.

02:28:27.132 --> 02:28:29.701 region:rollup2
THE BASIS FOR INFORMED CONSUMER

02:28:29.234 --> 02:28:31.169 region:rollup2
AND PATIENT CHOICES OF

02:28:29.701 --> 02:28:33.104 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:28:31.169 --> 02:28:34.072 region:rollup2
AND AS THE STATE THE FEDERAL

02:28:33.104 --> 02:28:35.507 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT UNDER THE AFFORDABLE

02:28:34.072 --> 02:28:37.142 region:rollup2
CARE ACT NOT ONLY UNDER

02:28:35.507 --> 02:28:38.309 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT OBAMA BUT ALSO UNDER

02:28:37.142 --> 02:28:40.044 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LARGELY

02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:41.246 region:rollup2
DEFER TO STATES TO DECIDE HOW TO

02:28:40.044 --> 02:28:42.914 region:rollup2
DEFINE THESE THESE NETWORK

02:28:41.246 --> 02:28:44.949 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY. AND NETWORK.

02:28:42.914 --> 02:28:46.785 region:rollup2
REGULATION THIS YEAR.

02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:48.119 region:rollup2
BUT THE TOP THE TOP LINE FOR ME

02:28:46.785 --> 02:28:49.387 region:rollup2
IS THAT ENSURING ACCURATE AND UP

02:28:48.119 --> 02:28:50.955 region:rollup2
TO DATE PROVIDER DIRECTORIES IS

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:53.091 region:rollup2
KEY TO WHATEVER STRATEGY YOU USE

02:28:50.955 --> 02:28:54.392 region:rollup2
BUT BEFORE.

02:28:53.091 --> 02:28:55.460 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S THREE P. QUESTIONS

02:28:54.392 --> 02:28:56.327 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD PUT OUT TO YOU.

02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:58.129 region:rollup2
TO KEEP AN EYE ON MOVING

02:28:56.327 --> 02:28:59.364 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:28:58.129 --> 02:29:00.298 region:rollup2
FIRST WE'RE WAITING REGULATORY

02:28:59.364 --> 02:29:02.066 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE FROM THE TRUMP

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:02.634 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ON THE USE OF SO

02:29:02.066 --> 02:29:04.569 region:rollup2
CALLED SHORT TERM INSURANCE

02:29:02.634 --> 02:29:05.537 region:rollup2
PLANS.

02:29:04.569 --> 02:29:08.139 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM INSURANCE PLANS HAVE

02:29:05.537 --> 02:29:10.275 region:rollup2
EXISTEDALONGSIDE THE ACA EVER

02:29:08.139 --> 02:29:10.809 region:rollup2
SINCE IT WAS ENACTED IN AND AND

02:29:10.275 --> 02:29:12.677 region:rollup2
AND PUT IN PLACE IN TWENTY

02:29:10.809 --> 02:29:13.478 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN.

02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:14.846 region:rollup2
BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

02:29:13.478 --> 02:29:17.515 region:rollup2
REALLY.

02:29:14.846 --> 02:29:19.617 region:rollup2
CRAMPED DOWN ON THE ABILITY OF

02:29:17.515 --> 02:29:20.952 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS TO USE SHORT TERM

02:29:19.617 --> 02:29:22.787 region:rollup2
PLANS WHICH ARE NOT COMPLIANT

02:29:20.952 --> 02:29:24.255 region:rollup2
WITH THE ACA'S REGULATORY

02:29:22.787 --> 02:29:24.823 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES ON ESSENTIAL HEALTH

02:29:24.255 --> 02:29:25.657 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AND THINGS THAT ARE

02:29:24.823 --> 02:29:27.992 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:29:25.657 --> 02:29:29.561 region:rollup2
LEASE UNDER IT PREVIOUSLY WHEN

02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:30.862 region:rollup2
THEY WERE NOT COMPLIANCE IN THE

02:29:29.561 --> 02:29:32.664 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

02:29:30.862 --> 02:29:33.765 region:rollup2
COMPLYING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL

02:29:32.664 --> 02:29:35.033 region:rollup2
MANDATE YOU IF YOU BOUGHT ONE OF

02:29:33.765 --> 02:29:36.901 region:rollup2
THESE SHORT TERM PLANS WHICH

02:29:35.033 --> 02:29:37.268 region:rollup2
GENERALLY UNDER RIGHT THEY HAVE

02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:39.003 region:rollup2
MUCH.

02:29:37.268 --> 02:29:41.439 region:rollup2
SKIP YOUR BENEFIT STRUCTURES

02:29:39.003 --> 02:29:41.973 region:rollup2
ETCETERA YOU BOUGHT ONE OF THESE

REFERENCED IS THAT PARTICULAR TO

02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:23.508 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OR IS THAT NATIONWIDE

02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:24.509 region:rollup2
NOW THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN

02:31:23.508 --> 02:31:26.210 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FROM WHAT WE'RE

02:31:24.509 --> 02:31:27.078 region:rollup2
SEEING OTHER PLACES.

02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:28.212 region:rollup2
OKAY SO IS THERE A DIFFERENCE

02:31:27.078 --> 02:31:29.247 region:rollup2
BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND THE REST

02:31:28.212 --> 02:31:30.882 region:rollup2
OF THE U. S. WELL I THINK THIS.

02:31:29.247 --> 02:31:31.849 region:rollup2
.

WORKFORCE IS A NATIONAL

02:31:33.885 --> 02:31:38.222 region:rollup2
PHENOMENON.

02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:39.190 region:rollup2
IS DATA SAID OUR SUPPLY OF

02:31:38.222 --> 02:31:40.892 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS.

02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:41.926 region:rollup2
ASH ALSO SAY THAT THE

02:31:40.892 --> 02:31:43.127 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN URBAN AND

02:31:41.926 --> 02:31:44.629 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS IS A NATIONAL

02:31:43.127 --> 02:31:46.764 region:rollup2
PHENOMENON WHERE EVER GO ACROSS

02:31:44.629 --> 02:31:48.533 region:rollup2
THE NATION RURAL AREAS. HAVE

02:31:46.764 --> 02:31:50.568 region:rollup2
FEWER POSITIONS IN URBAN AREAS

02:31:48.533 --> 02:31:52.036 region:rollup2
BUT RELATIVE TO OTHER STATES TO

02:31:50.568 --> 02:31:53.404 region:rollup2
TAKE WHERE ANY IN A WORSE

02:31:52.036 --> 02:31:57.241 region:rollup2
POSITION.

02:31:53.404 --> 02:32:00.011 region:rollup2
THEN THEN MANY THAN MANY STATES

02:31:57.241 --> 02:32:00.878 region:rollup2
BUT NOT BY NO MEANS THE WORST

02:32:00.011 --> 02:32:02.046 region:rollup2
AND WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS.

02:32:00.878 --> 02:32:02.714 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:32:02.046 --> 02:32:03.514 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT WE

02:32:02.714 --> 02:32:04.782 region:rollup2
HAVE A GOOD REASON I THINK ONE

02:32:03.514 --> 02:32:06.217 region:rollup2
REASON MAY BE THAT WE.

02:32:04.782 --> 02:32:08.853 region:rollup2
A HAVE LESS.

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:10.054 region:rollup2
MEDICAL EDUCATION CAPACITY

02:32:08.853 --> 02:32:12.390 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF OUR

02:32:10.054 --> 02:32:12.924 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT MANY STATES AND

02:32:12.390 --> 02:32:14.392 region:rollup2
IN BOTH THE MEDICAL SCHOOL

02:32:12.924 --> 02:32:15.994 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

02:32:14.392 --> 02:32:17.862 region:rollup2
AND THE RESIDENCY LEVEL THAT IF

02:32:15.994 --> 02:32:19.597 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT A PLACE LIKE IN NEW

02:32:17.862 --> 02:32:20.665 region:rollup2
YORK NEW YORK I THINK IS WHAT AT

02:32:19.597 --> 02:32:21.699 region:rollup2
THE OTHER EXTREME YOU MIGHT SAY

02:32:20.665 --> 02:32:23.534 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING OVER CAPITALIZE

02:32:21.699 --> 02:32:25.470 region:rollup2
BUT COMPARED TO SAY. A TEXAS OR

02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:26.738 region:rollup2
FLORIDA WHICH HAS HAD MUCH MORE

02:32:25.470 --> 02:32:28.439 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL.

02:32:26.738 --> 02:32:29.340 region:rollup2
GROSS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION OVER

02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:31.776 region:rollup2
THE LAST DECADE WE'RE UNDER

02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:33.978 region:rollup2
CAPITALIZED.

02:32:31.776 --> 02:32:35.480 region:rollup2
PAN AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS I

02:32:33.978 --> 02:32:36.748 region:rollup2
WAS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR.

02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:38.649 region:rollup2
NURSE PRACTITIONER DR.

02:32:36.748 --> 02:32:40.418 region:rollup2
.

02:32:38.649 --> 02:32:41.919 region:rollup2
SLIDE WE WE GET SOME LEGISLATION

02:32:40.418 --> 02:32:43.588 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR TO TRY TO.

02:32:41.919 --> 02:32:45.156 region:rollup2
HELPING CREE SOME ABILITY FOR

02:32:43.588 --> 02:32:46.224 region:rollup2
NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PRACTICE

02:32:45.156 --> 02:32:47.258 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU

02:32:46.224 --> 02:32:48.860 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY COMMENT WHETHER THERE'S

02:32:47.258 --> 02:32:49.060 region:rollup2
ANY EVIDENCE.

02:32:48.860 --> 02:32:50.928 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:52.430 region:rollup2
.

02:32:50.928 --> 02:32:54.832 region:rollup2
KIND OF.

02:32:52.430 --> 02:32:55.233 region:rollup2
THE MODEL OF OF AREAS THAT

02:32:54.832 --> 02:32:57.435 region:rollup2
UTILIZE MORE NURSE

02:32:55.233 --> 02:32:59.070 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS.

02:32:57.435 --> 02:32:59.637 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT DOCTORS ARE DOING IN

02:32:59.070 --> 02:33:01.372 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACES IN TERMS OF HOW

02:32:59.637 --> 02:33:03.641 region:rollup2
COME.

02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:04.642 region:rollup2
SO I THINK I AM STUDIES THAT

02:33:03.641 --> 02:33:06.611 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE HEAD TO HEAD

02:33:04.642 --> 02:33:07.712 region:rollup2
COMPARISONS OF PRIMARY CARE

02:33:06.611 --> 02:33:09.914 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND NURSE

02:33:07.712 --> 02:33:10.982 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS. AND PHYSICIAN

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:12.050 region:rollup2
ASSISTANTS WHEN LOOKING WITHIN

02:33:10.982 --> 02:33:12.884 region:rollup2
THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE MEAN

02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:14.185 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS THAT IN

02:33:12.884 --> 02:33:16.087 region:rollup2
PEACE MPAS IMPRESSED PRIMARY

02:33:14.185 --> 02:33:17.422 region:rollup2
CARE PHYSICIANS ARE ALL. TRAINED

02:33:16.087 --> 02:33:18.556 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT THERE REALLY AREN'T

02:33:17.422 --> 02:33:24.195 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:26.731 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES.

02:33:24.195 --> 02:33:27.231 region:rollup2
IS WALDRON.

02:33:26.731 --> 02:33:29.367 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

.

02:33:29.367 --> 02:33:33.504 region:rollup2
A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS.

02:33:30.535 --> 02:33:34.439 region:rollup2
FROM MISTER PEROT. IN YOUR OF

02:33:33.504 --> 02:33:36.574 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION.

02:33:34.439 --> 02:33:38.276 region:rollup2
.

02:33:36.574 --> 02:33:39.977 region:rollup2
I JUST OF TWO QUESTIONS LONG WAS

02:33:38.276 --> 02:33:40.311 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE PROVIDER

02:33:39.977 --> 02:33:42.213 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION.

02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:43.748 region:rollup2
.

02:33:42.213 --> 02:33:47.385 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH PHYSICIANS ACCEPTING

02:33:43.748 --> 02:33:48.186 region:rollup2
NEW.

02:33:47.385 --> 02:33:49.587 region:rollup2
NEW MEDI CAL PATIENTS.

02:33:48.186 --> 02:33:50.288 region:rollup2
.

02:33:49.587 --> 02:33:51.556 region:rollup2
THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT

02:33:50.288 --> 02:33:53.825 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATES COULD BE

02:33:51.556 --> 02:33:54.926 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT ANOTHER ISSUE WAS

02:33:53.825 --> 02:33:56.894 region:rollup2
GETTING REFERRALS TO SPECIALTY

02:33:54.926 --> 02:33:58.863 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:33:56.894 --> 02:34:01.099 region:rollup2
IN MEDICO.

02:33:58.863 --> 02:34:03.634 region:rollup2
ACTUATION SO.

02:34:01.099 --> 02:34:05.069 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF BEING ABLE TO GET

02:34:03.634 --> 02:34:07.038 region:rollup2
REFERRALS TO SPECIALTY CARE IS

02:34:05.069 --> 02:34:08.973 region:rollup2
THAT DRIVEN BY THE LACK OF

02:34:07.038 --> 02:34:11.843 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS OR IS

02:34:08.973 --> 02:34:12.810 region:rollup2
IT DO TO REGIONAL ISSUES YOU

02:34:11.843 --> 02:34:15.379 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU CAN'T. GET TO A

02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:16.547 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST IN A RURAL AREA AND

02:34:15.379 --> 02:34:18.382 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST KIND OF AVERAGE. WHAT

02:34:16.547 --> 02:34:19.984 region:rollup2
WOULD BE?

02:34:18.382 --> 02:34:22.453 region:rollup2
THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT IT'S.

02:34:19.984 --> 02:34:22.987 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S ALL THE ABOVE SO THAT

02:34:22.453 --> 02:34:24.455 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:34:22.987 --> 02:34:25.690 region:rollup2
FIRST QUESTION CHILDREN THAT

02:34:24.455 --> 02:34:27.492 region:rollup2
CHART ON THE LEFT WAS ASKED OF

02:34:25.690 --> 02:34:29.227 region:rollup2
ALL PHYSICIANS SO ALL THE ALL

02:34:27.492 --> 02:34:30.995 region:rollup2
THE ANSWERS THERE. WERE ANSWERS

02:34:29.227 --> 02:34:33.431 region:rollup2
THAT WERE GIVEN BY BOTH PRIMARY

02:34:30.995 --> 02:34:35.833 region:rollup2
CARE PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALISTS.

02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:37.368 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S MANY OF THE SAME

02:34:35.833 --> 02:34:38.669 region:rollup2
REASONS SO IT'S IT'S IT'S

02:34:37.368 --> 02:34:39.804 region:rollup2
SPECIALISTS ARE NOT

02:34:38.669 --> 02:34:42.073 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN MEDICARE

02:34:39.804 --> 02:34:43.908 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOR.

02:34:42.073 --> 02:34:45.276 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF RATES BECAUSE OF THE

02:34:43.908 --> 02:34:46.844 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN BECAUSE OF

02:34:45.276 --> 02:34:48.813 region:rollup2
THE OF THE RANGE OF ISSUES AND

02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:50.882 region:rollup2
THEN CERTAINLY THE GEOGRAPHIC.

02:34:48.813 --> 02:34:52.183 region:rollup2
THE AGGRIEVED GEOGRAPHIC ISSUE

02:34:50.882 --> 02:34:53.251 region:rollup2
IS THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE.

02:34:52.183 --> 02:34:54.619 region:rollup2
WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:34:53.251 --> 02:34:56.654 region:rollup2
FIND IN OUR WORK IN?

02:34:54.619 --> 02:34:58.456 region:rollup2
IN TELEHEALTH IS THAT.

02:34:56.654 --> 02:34:59.724 region:rollup2
.

02:34:58.456 --> 02:35:01.125 region:rollup2
WHAT ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE ONE

02:34:59.724 --> 02:35:03.394 region:rollup2
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT PRIMARY

02:35:01.125 --> 02:35:05.797 region:rollup2
CARE PHYSICIANS UNDERSTANDABLY

02:35:03.394 --> 02:35:07.198 region:rollup2
THEY PREFERRED TO REFER TO THIS

02:35:05.797 --> 02:35:08.533 region:rollup2
AND THEY KNOW THEY KNOW WELL?

02:35:07.198 --> 02:35:09.734 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO REFER

02:35:08.533 --> 02:35:11.269 region:rollup2
OUT FOR A CONSOLE THEY PREFER IT

02:35:09.734 --> 02:35:12.637 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:35:11.269 --> 02:35:14.438 region:rollup2
STATE SPECIALIST ALSO THEN BE

02:35:12.637 --> 02:35:16.140 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR AN APPOINTMENT.

02:35:14.438 --> 02:35:17.909 region:rollup2
THAT'S OFTEN NOT NOT.

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.743 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE CRITICALLY IN RURAL

02:35:17.909 --> 02:35:21.179 region:rollup2
AREAS.

02:35:18.743 --> 02:35:22.280 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE IS WE FIND.

02:35:21.179 --> 02:35:24.415 region:rollup2
SOME.

02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:25.817 region:rollup2
COURTING TIME.

02:35:24.415 --> 02:35:27.585 region:rollup2
WHEN ONE INTRODUCES AYE

02:35:25.817 --> 02:35:29.754 region:rollup2
TELEHEALTH INTO A PRIMARY CARE

02:35:27.585 --> 02:35:31.989 region:rollup2
PRACTICE OF PHYSICIANS GETTING

02:35:29.754 --> 02:35:33.024 region:rollup2
TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER IT'S PERHAPS

02:35:31.989 --> 02:35:34.625 region:rollup2
ONE REASON THAT.

02:35:33.024 --> 02:35:35.593 region:rollup2
THAT DAY.

02:35:34.625 --> 02:35:37.228 region:rollup2
E. CONSUL DID YOU REFERRAL

02:35:35.593 --> 02:35:38.129 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS HAVE WORKED SO WELL IN

02:35:37.228 --> 02:35:40.565 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL

02:35:38.129 --> 02:35:42.266 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A

02:35:40.565 --> 02:35:43.968 region:rollup2
GREATER FAMILIARITY OF THE

02:35:42.266 --> 02:35:45.102 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AMONG EACH OTHER BUT.

02:35:43.968 --> 02:35:45.503 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S THOSE THERE'S AS

02:35:45.102 --> 02:35:47.438 region:rollup2
RANGE OF REASONS.

02:35:45.503 --> 02:35:48.706 region:rollup2
OKAY

02:35:47.438 --> 02:35:50.541 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION WAS

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:52.376 region:rollup2
OF YOU HAVE SOME CHARTS ON PAGE

02:35:50.541 --> 02:35:53.911 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN OF YOUR. UP PRESENT IT

02:35:52.376 --> 02:35:56.147 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST SHOW THE QUALITY OF

02:35:53.911 --> 02:35:58.182 region:rollup2
CARE AND MEDI CAL. MANAGED CARE

02:35:56.147 --> 02:36:00.084 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE NATIONAL MEDICAID

02:35:58.182 --> 02:36:01.586 region:rollup2
AVERAGES.

02:36:00.084 --> 02:36:03.387 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE NOT IMPROVING WHICH IS

02:36:01.586 --> 02:36:05.122 region:rollup2
KIND OF THEIR.

02:36:03.387 --> 02:36:07.658 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY STATES THAT ARE

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:10.561 region:rollup2
DOING BETTER ARE WHEN YOU LOOK

02:36:07.658 --> 02:36:11.696 region:rollup2
OVERALL ANOTHER. THIS TYPE OF

02:36:10.561 --> 02:36:13.598 region:rollup2
THE UNABOMBER LOOKING AT THEY

02:36:11.696 --> 02:36:16.500 region:rollup2
THINK HE THIS CHART OTHER ANY

02:36:13.598 --> 02:36:19.003 region:rollup2
OTHER DOING BETTER IS NEW YORK

02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:21.072 region:rollup2
DOING BETTER SAY THAN.

02:36:19.003 --> 02:36:23.107 region:rollup2
THEN WE ARE IS IN A SENIOR YEAH

02:36:21.072 --> 02:36:24.775 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT IT'S HARD TO COMPARE.

02:36:23.107 --> 02:36:26.110 region:rollup2
.

02:36:24.775 --> 02:36:27.211 region:rollup2
FOR ALL THE SAME REASONS THAT

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:29.280 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO COMPARE MEDI CAL TO

02:36:27.211 --> 02:36:31.048 region:rollup2
OTHER FORMS OF COVERAGE HERE IN

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:32.750 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE.

02:36:31.048 --> 02:36:34.185 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN THE POPULATIONS

02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:35.853 region:rollup2
THE SAME IS TRUE WHEN COMPARING

02:36:34.185 --> 02:36:38.055 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS ACROSS

02:36:35.853 --> 02:36:39.490 region:rollup2
STATES FOR EXAMPLE SEVERAL YEARS

02:36:38.055 --> 02:36:41.425 region:rollup2
AGO WE EXPANDED THE MEDICAID

02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:43.294 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM TO SENIORS

02:36:41.425 --> 02:36:45.930 region:rollup2
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.

02:36:43.294 --> 02:36:48.566 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE INCLUDED

02:36:45.930 --> 02:36:49.900 region:rollup2
IN OUR RATES.

02:36:48.566 --> 02:36:51.535 region:rollup2
AND YOU MIGHT LOOK AT ANOTHER

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:54.405 region:rollup2
STATE WHERE THE DOZEN EXPAND ITS

02:36:51.535 --> 02:36:56.907 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM.

02:36:54.405 --> 02:36:57.642 region:rollup2
TO THAT POPULATION AND AND THEY

02:36:56.907 --> 02:37:00.344 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T BE INCLUDED THE RIGHT

02:36:57.642 --> 02:37:01.279 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S AGAIN OFTEN APPLES.

02:37:00.344 --> 02:37:02.546 region:rollup2
TO ORANGES.

02:37:01.279 --> 02:37:04.548 region:rollup2
COMPARISON.

02:37:02.546 --> 02:37:05.583 region:rollup2
.

02:37:04.548 --> 02:37:07.285 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT I WAS STANDING WE

02:37:05.583 --> 02:37:08.219 region:rollup2
DO SOME SEE SOME STATES.

02:37:07.285 --> 02:37:10.021 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT STICKS

02:37:08.219 --> 02:37:11.889 region:rollup2
OUT IN MY MIND IS MASSACHUSETTS.

02:37:10.021 --> 02:37:12.556 region:rollup2
OUT IS.

02:37:11.889 --> 02:37:14.325 region:rollup2
WRITTEN ONE.

02:37:12.556 --> 02:37:15.960 region:rollup2
WHO HAS A NUMBER OF UP PLANS

02:37:14.325 --> 02:37:17.695 region:rollup2
THAT OFTEN WILL WIN AWARDS AND

02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:19.697 region:rollup2
EVEN IN THE MEDICAID SPHERE?

02:37:17.695 --> 02:37:22.300 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT

02:37:19.697 --> 02:37:25.036 region:rollup2
SEEM TO BE DOING BETTER.

02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:26.137 region:rollup2
YEAH CASTLES BENCHMARKS.

02:37:25.036 --> 02:37:27.104 region:rollup2
THE WELL CHILD VISITS. BREAST

02:37:26.137 --> 02:37:28.372 region:rollup2
CANCER SCREENING

02:37:27.104 --> 02:37:31.008 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT.

02:37:28.372 --> 02:37:33.244 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:37:31.008 --> 02:37:35.313 region:rollup2
THE DOING BETTER THE WE ARE OKAY

02:37:33.244 --> 02:37:37.148 region:rollup2
I'M. THEN REALLY QUICK.

02:37:35.313 --> 02:37:39.684 region:rollup2
DOCTOR COUGHED MOVED.

02:37:37.148 --> 02:37:39.984 region:rollup2
FOR YEAH YOUR YOUR CHART WHO'S

02:37:39.684 --> 02:37:41.218 region:rollup2
SHOWING THE.

02:37:39.984 --> 02:37:42.386 region:rollup2
.

02:37:41.218 --> 02:37:42.920 region:rollup2
RATIO OF ACTIVE PATIENT CARE

02:37:42.386 --> 02:37:44.622 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED

02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:47.325 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

02:37:44.622 --> 02:37:48.960 region:rollup2
BY REGION. PART OF MY DISTRICT

02:37:47.325 --> 02:37:51.696 region:rollup2
IS THE INLAND EMPIRE MOVEMENT I

02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:53.998 region:rollup2
NOTICE THIRTY FIVE.

02:37:51.696 --> 02:37:55.366 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND I

02:37:53.998 --> 02:37:56.867 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN I MEET WITH MY

02:37:55.366 --> 02:37:58.669 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND THE RIVERSIDE

02:37:56.867 --> 02:38:00.371 region:rollup2
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.

02:37:58.669 --> 02:38:02.373 region:rollup2
THEIR BIGGEST ISSUE IS

02:38:00.371 --> 02:38:04.175 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATES

02:38:02.373 --> 02:38:05.910 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE SO MUCH LOWER THAN

02:38:04.175 --> 02:38:07.211 region:rollup2
OTHER AREAS EVEN AROUND THE

02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:07.878 region:rollup2
STATE. THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO

02:38:07.211 --> 02:38:10.247 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH.

02:38:07.878 --> 02:38:11.816 region:rollup2
.

02:38:10.247 --> 02:38:13.718 region:rollup2
YOU NOBLE WHEN YOU SEE LIKE THIS

02:38:11.816 --> 02:38:15.419 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY HIGHLIGHTED.

02:38:13.718 --> 02:38:16.053 region:rollup2
AND I THINK INTO ONE OF THE

02:38:15.419 --> 02:38:18.422 region:rollup2
THINGS WE REALLY HAVE TO DO IS

02:38:16.053 --> 02:38:19.724 region:rollup2
GET. HILL LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:22.059 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE BESIDE

02:38:19.724 --> 02:38:23.494 region:rollup2
RATES THAT COULD BE. IMPACTING

02:38:22.059 --> 02:38:24.562 region:rollup2
THEM BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVEN WITH

02:38:23.494 --> 02:38:26.063 region:rollup2
DANTICAT ALL THAT PART OF MY

02:38:24.562 --> 02:38:26.897 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

02:38:26.063 --> 02:38:28.265 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CANNOT ACCESS IT AND TO

02:38:26.897 --> 02:38:30.501 region:rollup2
CALL.

02:38:28.265 --> 02:38:32.703 region:rollup2
DENTIST WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF.

02:38:30.501 --> 02:38:34.572 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY LIVE SOUND

02:38:32.703 --> 02:38:36.741 region:rollup2
SO RIGHT YOU KNOW IT IS A RIGHT

02:38:34.572 --> 02:38:37.575 region:rollup2
I THINK RATES ARE ARE PART OF IT

02:38:36.741 --> 02:38:39.443 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK?

02:38:37.575 --> 02:38:40.678 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE INTERESTING IN YOUR

02:38:39.443 --> 02:38:42.279 region:rollup2
REGION AT LEAST ON THE MAT ARE

02:38:40.678 --> 02:38:43.748 region:rollup2
AMONG PHYSICIANS TO SEE WHAT

02:38:42.279 --> 02:38:44.782 region:rollup2
HAPPENS AS. I AM YOU KNOW YOUR

02:38:43.748 --> 02:38:45.983 region:rollup2
NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL AT UC

02:38:44.782 --> 02:38:48.686 region:rollup2
RIVERSIDE.

02:38:45.983 --> 02:38:50.888 region:rollup2
BEGINS TO GRADUATE IN IS THOSE

02:38:48.686 --> 02:38:52.990 region:rollup2
FOLKS FINISH THEIR RESIDENCY.

02:38:50.888 --> 02:38:54.759 region:rollup2
WILL THEY PRACTICE IN THOSE

02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:55.926 region:rollup2
AREAS OF RIVERSIDE THAT ARE OF

02:38:54.759 --> 02:38:57.628 region:rollup2
GREATEST.

02:38:55.926 --> 02:38:58.996 region:rollup2
I NEED.

02:38:57.628 --> 02:39:00.031 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THEY THINK THAT'S

02:38:58.996 --> 02:39:00.898 region:rollup2
BEEN ONE AGENT YOU HAVEN'T HAD

02:39:00.031 --> 02:39:02.433 region:rollup2
AS MUCH COMPARED TO SAY LOS

02:39:00.898 --> 02:39:04.769 region:rollup2
ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO OR EVEN

02:39:02.433 --> 02:39:06.937 region:rollup2
AREN'T. YOU HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH

02:39:04.769 --> 02:39:09.273 region:rollup2
AND MANY PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING.

02:39:06.937 --> 02:39:10.508 region:rollup2
IN IN THE LOCAL AREA AND AND SO

02:39:09.273 --> 02:39:12.443 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT

02:39:10.508 --> 02:39:13.711 region:rollup2
PAYMENT IS CERTAINLY CERTAINLY

02:39:12.443 --> 02:39:15.212 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF FOLKS WILLINGNESS.

02:39:13.711 --> 02:39:17.181 region:rollup2
I'VE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

02:39:15.212 --> 02:39:19.750 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PROGRAM IS AS MR PEROT

02:39:17.181 --> 02:39:21.552 region:rollup2
SHOWED. THAT THE A BIG PART IN

02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:22.920 region:rollup2
INSECT ALSO IN IN TERMS OF NOT

02:39:21.552 --> 02:39:24.488 region:rollup2
JUST PAYMENT. BUT THE

02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:26.824 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND

02:39:24.488 --> 02:39:28.893 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:39:26.824 --> 02:39:29.460 region:rollup2
THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT NOT

02:39:28.893 --> 02:39:31.128 region:rollup2
ONLY ARE YOU BEING PAID LESS

02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:32.730 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:39:31.128 --> 02:39:34.932 region:rollup2
YOU'RE STRUGGLING MORE TO GET

02:39:32.730 --> 02:39:37.101 region:rollup2
PAID AT ALL.

02:39:34.932 --> 02:39:39.770 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THAT

02:39:37.101 --> 02:39:41.439 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDABLY FOR INDEPENDENT.

02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:42.807 region:rollup2
PRACTICES WHETHER THEIR

02:39:41.439 --> 02:39:46.610 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS R. DENNIS TENDS TO

02:39:42.807 --> 02:39:47.945 region:rollup2
MAKE FOLKS FRUSTRATED UNHAPPY

02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:48.846 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES SAY.

02:39:47.945 --> 02:39:49.847 region:rollup2
NO I'M NOT WILLING TO

02:39:48.846 --> 02:39:52.550 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM IT'S

02:39:49.847 --> 02:39:53.984 region:rollup2
TOO MUCH HASSLE.

02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:54.185 region:rollup2
AND JUST REAL QUICK THE SECOND

02:39:53.984 --> 02:39:55.019 region:rollup2
UNDER.

02:39:54.185 --> 02:39:55.619 region:rollup2
.

02:39:55.019 --> 02:39:56.387 region:rollup2
WHICHI THOUGHT WAS EXCELLENT

02:39:55.619 --> 02:39:59.023 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES FOR EXPANDING THE

02:39:56.387 --> 02:39:59.690 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE CAPACITY OF MORE

02:39:59.023 --> 02:40:00.891 region:rollup2
THAN ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS IS

02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:01.358 region:rollup2
EXPANDING TRAINING IN MEDICAL

02:40:00.891 --> 02:40:02.993 region:rollup2
SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY.

02:40:01.358 --> 02:40:03.928 region:rollup2
.

02:40:02.993 --> 02:40:04.929 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND I

02:40:03.928 --> 02:40:06.263 region:rollup2
HAVE WRITTEN NUMEROUS CLINICS IN

02:40:04.929 --> 02:40:08.065 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY

02:40:06.263 --> 02:40:10.468 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST INCOME.

02:40:08.065 --> 02:40:12.670 region:rollup2
RIGHT CENSUS TRACKS IN THE

02:40:10.468 --> 02:40:15.072 region:rollup2
NATION IN MY MY DISTRICT.

02:40:12.670 --> 02:40:16.974 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF ABILITY TO GET

02:40:15.072 --> 02:40:18.676 region:rollup2
REFERRALS IS THE KEY THAT'S WHY

02:40:16.974 --> 02:40:20.411 region:rollup2
IT'S KIND SPARKED MY INTEREST.

02:40:18.676 --> 02:40:22.079 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A CLINIC YOU

02:40:20.411 --> 02:40:24.281 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW HOW DO WE DO WITH THE

02:40:22.079 --> 02:40:25.983 region:rollup2
CHRONIC CARE ISSUES.

02:40:24.281 --> 02:40:27.251 region:rollup2
IF WE ARE YOU WORKING IN ONE

02:46:08.425 --> 02:46:09.960 region:rollup2
THAT THING THAT MUCH SO?

02:46:08.959 --> 02:46:11.061 region:rollup2
?

02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:11.728 region:rollup2
MISS COLLETTE.

DELICATE

02:46:12.162 --> 02:46:13.797 region:rollup2
GRAND.

02:46:12.629 --> 02:46:14.364 region:rollup2
BARGAIN.

02:46:13.797 --> 02:46:15.833 region:rollup2
VERY VERY INTERESTING VERY

02:46:14.364 --> 02:46:16.400 region:rollup2
INTERESTING

02:46:15.833 --> 02:46:17.234 region:rollup2
STATEMENT THERE.

02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:19.269 region:rollup2
I'M CURIOUS.

02:46:17.234 --> 02:46:20.103 region:rollup2
IN YOU KNOW. REPRESENTING A

02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:20.637 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WHERE HAVE FIVE

02:46:20.103 --> 02:46:21.638 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:23.040 region:rollup2
AND A VERY RURAL DISTRICT AND

02:46:21.638 --> 02:46:25.409 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE AROUND.

02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:28.812 region:rollup2
PLANNED AVAILABILITY AND COST.

02:46:25.409 --> 02:46:29.446 region:rollup2
IN OTHER STATES I MEAN YOU

02:46:28.812 --> 02:46:31.014 region:rollup2
MENTION JUST ACT AS THE STATE

02:46:29.446 --> 02:46:31.648 region:rollup2
WAS A COUNTY HAVE LIKE THREE

02:46:31.014 --> 02:46:33.116 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE

02:46:31.648 --> 02:46:34.618 region:rollup2
IS THAT RIGHT. NET AND SO HOW

02:46:33.116 --> 02:46:35.986 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PRETTY PRETTY THIN RISK

02:46:34.618 --> 02:46:37.988 region:rollup2
POOL.

02:46:35.986 --> 02:46:39.356 region:rollup2
ONE PERSON GETS A HANG NAIL

02:46:37.988 --> 02:46:42.059 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.

02:46:39.356 --> 02:46:43.560 region:rollup2
BUT BUT HOW IT IN OTHER STATES

02:46:42.059 --> 02:46:45.329 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD THEY LOOKED AT

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:46.563 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS OF COOLING DE HAD

02:46:45.329 --> 02:46:48.432 region:rollup2
HAS STATES MANY DIFFERENT WAYS

02:46:46.563 --> 02:46:51.301 region:rollup2
OF POOLING THAT BECAUSE. YOU

02:46:48.432 --> 02:46:51.301 region:rollup2
KNOW IT IS IT IS AN ISSUE PRETTY

02:46:51.368 --> 02:46:54.705 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:46:52.703 --> 02:46:55.539 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY YOU LEAVE

02:46:54.705 --> 02:46:58.208 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO YOU GO NORTH IT'S

02:46:55.539 --> 02:47:00.177 region:rollup2
RURAL OKAY AND SO YET YET WE

02:46:58.208 --> 02:47:01.111 region:rollup2
HAVE MUCH LOWER PREMIUMS IN IN

02:47:00.177 --> 02:47:02.880 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE THERE

02:47:01.111 --> 02:47:05.349 region:rollup2
BEEN MODE MOVEMENTS IN OTHER

02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:06.583 region:rollup2
STATES A SALE OKAY. PLANS.

02:47:05.349 --> 02:47:08.085 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE

02:47:06.583 --> 02:47:09.253 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GONNA PULL ALL RURAL

02:47:08.085 --> 02:47:10.654 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM INTO ONE

02:47:09.253 --> 02:47:12.322 region:rollup2
POOL OR AT THAT HAVE THERE BEEN

02:47:10.654 --> 02:47:13.991 region:rollup2
OTHER STRATEGIES BECAUSE IT IS

02:47:12.322 --> 02:47:14.424 region:rollup2
IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING.

02:47:13.991 --> 02:47:16.660 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:47:14.424 --> 02:47:18.562 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M THE PEOPLE OF MY

02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:20.230 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE NO LESS HEALTHY

02:47:18.562 --> 02:47:21.732 region:rollup2
THAN THE PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS

02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:22.866 region:rollup2
OF LOS ANGELES YET WE'RE PAYING

02:47:21.732 --> 02:47:24.234 region:rollup2
HIGHER PREMIUMS AND THAT'S IN

02:47:22.866 --> 02:47:26.270 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL.

02:47:24.234 --> 02:47:28.238 region:rollup2
UNFAIRNESS THERE SO HELP ME WITH

02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:29.673 region:rollup2
HELP ME WITH YEAH SURE SO WHEN

02:47:28.238 --> 02:47:31.675 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE ACTIONS

02:47:29.673 --> 02:47:33.110 region:rollup2
OF OTHER STATES I'M CERTAINLY

02:47:31.675 --> 02:47:34.544 region:rollup2
YOU MAY ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THIS

02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:35.712 region:rollup2
AND NUMBER STATES HAVE LOOKED AT

02:47:34.544 --> 02:47:36.880 region:rollup2
REINSURANCE ON WHICH IS

02:47:35.712 --> 02:47:38.515 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY INSURANCE FOR THE

02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:40.484 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT WHAT IT

02:47:38.515 --> 02:47:42.786 region:rollup2
DOES. IS IT IT.

02:47:40.484 --> 02:47:45.856 region:rollup2
AID ESSENTIALLY.

02:47:42.786 --> 02:47:47.157 region:rollup2
FOR SAY FOR EXAMPLE FOR US

02:47:45.856 --> 02:47:49.826 region:rollup2
SMALL.

02:47:47.157 --> 02:47:52.329 region:rollup2
RISK POOL. WHERE YOU HAVE A HIGH

02:47:49.826 --> 02:47:54.464 region:rollup2
COST PERSON WITH HEMOPHILIA OR?

02:47:52.329 --> 02:47:55.999 region:rollup2
HIV AIDS ARE YOU THOSE WRITTEN

02:47:54.464 --> 02:47:57.100 region:rollup2
MILLION PLUS DOLLAR CONDITIONS.

02:47:55.999 --> 02:47:58.535 region:rollup2
IT ESSENTIALLY.

02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:59.670 region:rollup2
.

02:47:58.535 --> 02:48:01.972 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A QUESTION.

02:47:59.670 --> 02:48:03.540 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT THOSE IN CHARGE FROM

02:48:01.972 --> 02:48:05.375 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:07.177 region:rollup2
COST.

02:48:05.375 --> 02:48:09.546 region:rollup2
GROUP OF PATIENTS SO FOR

02:48:07.177 --> 02:48:10.847 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ALASKA AYE IMPLEMENTED A

02:48:09.546 --> 02:48:11.815 region:rollup2
REINSURANCE PROGRAM IN TWENTY

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:13.050 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

02:48:11.815 --> 02:48:14.818 region:rollup2
THEY WENT FROM PREMIUM

02:48:13.050 --> 02:48:16.920 region:rollup2
INCREASES OF ABOUT FORTY NINE

02:48:14.818 --> 02:48:18.655 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO NINE PERCENT SO THEY

02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:20.057 region:rollup2
REALLY BROUGHT THOSE PREMIUM

02:48:18.655 --> 02:48:21.058 region:rollup2
INCREASES DOWN.

02:48:20.057 --> 02:48:21.592 region:rollup2
VERY SUBSTANTIALLY BY

02:48:21.058 --> 02:48:23.860 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING A REINSURANCE

02:48:21.592 --> 02:48:25.529 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:27.230 region:rollup2
A STATE LIKE WASHINGTON AS I'M

02:48:25.529 --> 02:48:29.433 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOKING AT REINSURANCE BUT

02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:31.368 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO ARE LOOKING OUT THOSE

02:48:29.433 --> 02:48:33.604 region:rollup2
RATING REGION'S RIGHT.

02:48:31.368 --> 02:48:34.938 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THE

02:48:33.604 --> 02:48:36.707 region:rollup2
EVERY STATE IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU

02:48:34.938 --> 02:48:38.175 region:rollup2
KNOW HAS NINETEEN RATING REGIONS

02:48:36.707 --> 02:48:39.142 region:rollup2
BUT DIFFERENT STATES APPROACH

02:48:38.175 --> 02:48:41.178 region:rollup2
THEIR RATING REGIONS IN

02:48:39.142 --> 02:48:41.745 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO WASHINGTON

02:48:41.178 --> 02:48:44.414 region:rollup2
AND.

02:48:41.745 --> 02:48:46.316 region:rollup2
IS IS LOOKING AT COULD THEY

02:48:44.414 --> 02:48:48.085 region:rollup2
WERE REDESIGNED THOSE RATING

02:48:46.316 --> 02:48:50.020 region:rollup2
REGION'S THOSE GEOGRAPHIC RATING

02:48:48.085 --> 02:48:52.522 region:rollup2
REGIONS TO MAKE IT.

02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:54.958 region:rollup2
TO MORE ADEQUATELY ALLOW.

02:48:52.522 --> 02:48:56.059 region:rollup2
CARRIERS TO PRICE FOR THE REST

02:48:54.958 --> 02:48:57.661 region:rollup2
THAT THEY FACED IN THOSE REGIONS

02:48:56.059 --> 02:48:59.730 region:rollup2
SO WASHINGTON MIGHT BE ANOTHER

02:48:57.661 --> 02:49:01.498 region:rollup2
STATE TO LOOK AT.

02:48:59.730 --> 02:49:02.499 region:rollup2
IN AS YOU'RE TALKING THAT WE'RE

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:04.034 region:rollup2
TO TALK TO LIVE ABOUT THE PUBLIC

02:49:02.499 --> 02:49:05.636 region:rollup2
OPTION IF YOU'RE IF CALIFORNIA

02:49:04.034 --> 02:49:07.304 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK AT A PUBLIC AUCTION

02:49:05.636 --> 02:49:08.005 region:rollup2
OPTION WHAT WOULD YOU FOR MEDI

02:49:07.304 --> 02:49:13.210 region:rollup2
CAL. AND WHAT WOULD YOU HOW

02:49:08.005 --> 02:49:14.277 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE CRAFT THAT.

02:49:13.210 --> 02:49:15.078 region:rollup2
TOILETS WITH EVERYTHING

02:49:14.277 --> 02:49:16.813 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE POLICY OF COURSE THE

02:49:15.078 --> 02:49:17.481 region:rollup2
DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON THE

02:49:16.813 --> 02:49:19.383 region:rollup2
MEAN ONE APPROACH AND AND THAT'S

02:49:17.481 --> 02:49:21.151 region:rollup2
INTERESTING OF COURSE BECAUSE

02:49:19.383 --> 02:49:23.120 region:rollup2
I'M I WAS POINT OUT WHEN.

02:49:21.151 --> 02:49:25.522 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING TO REPUBLICANS.

02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:27.224 region:rollup2
IN WASHINGTON DC IS THAT IN

02:49:25.522 --> 02:49:28.792 region:rollup2
FACT THE REPUBLICAN LED CONGRESS

02:49:27.224 --> 02:49:31.261 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY CREATED THE MEDICARE

02:49:28.792 --> 02:49:33.163 region:rollup2
PART D. PROGRAM CREATED A PUBLIC

02:49:31.261 --> 02:49:34.765 region:rollup2
OPTION FALL BACK. IN THAT

02:49:33.163 --> 02:49:36.066 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND THE IDEA WAS IF THEY

02:49:34.765 --> 02:49:37.667 region:rollup2
COULDN'T GET A PRIVATE CARRIER

02:49:36.066 --> 02:49:39.503 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE THERE WOULD BE

02:49:37.667 --> 02:49:41.038 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:49:39.503 --> 02:49:42.406 region:rollup2
PUBLIC OPTION AND THAT WOULD

02:49:41.038 --> 02:49:43.407 region:rollup2
COME IN AND PRIDE AND IT TURNED

02:49:42.406 --> 02:49:44.474 region:rollup2
OUT MEDICARE PART D. DIDN'T NEED

02:49:43.407 --> 02:49:46.076 region:rollup2
IT THEY HAD ENOUGH PRIVATE

02:49:44.474 --> 02:49:47.744 region:rollup2
INSURERS BUT THE POINT IS THAT

02:49:46.076 --> 02:49:49.413 region:rollup2
THERE WAS. THIS WAS A REPUBLICAN

02:49:47.744 --> 02:49:52.416 region:rollup2
IDEA. BUT.

02:49:49.413 --> 02:49:55.018 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IN A IN A STATE COULD.

02:49:52.416 --> 02:49:56.253 region:rollup2
SET UP A FALLBACK OPTIONS SO

02:49:55.018 --> 02:49:57.988 region:rollup2
THAT IF THEY COULDN'T GET A

02:49:56.253 --> 02:49:59.322 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURER TO CON MEN THERE

02:49:57.988 --> 02:50:00.924 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE AN ENTITY THAT WOULD

02:49:59.322 --> 02:50:02.759 region:rollup2
CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. I'M NOW

02:50:00.924 --> 02:50:04.394 region:rollup2
THERE ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES

02:50:02.759 --> 02:50:06.430 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW YOU SET UP PRABHAT. AT

02:50:04.394 --> 02:50:07.130 region:rollup2
WORK HOW DO YOU REIMBURSE

02:50:06.430 --> 02:50:08.298 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS

02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:09.499 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU DO CLAIMS

02:50:08.298 --> 02:50:11.334 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WHO BEARS THE

02:50:09.499 --> 02:50:12.669 region:rollup2
RISK SO THOSE ARE ALL KINDS OF

02:50:11.334 --> 02:50:14.671 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO GET INTO

02:50:12.669 --> 02:50:15.605 region:rollup2
BUT THAT MIGHT BE ONE OPTION ON

02:50:14.671 --> 02:50:16.406 region:rollup2
YOU MAINTAIN THE CURRENT

02:50:15.605 --> 02:50:18.241 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE BUT YOU SAID LOOKING

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:19.910 region:rollup2
FOR DOWN TO ONE CARRIER? OR

02:50:18.241 --> 02:50:22.479 region:rollup2
THERE'S A RISK OF NO CARRIER

02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:22.979 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A THE STATE

02:50:22.479 --> 02:50:25.382 region:rollup2
STEP IN AND PROVIDE THAT

02:50:22.979 --> 02:50:26.717 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

02:50:25.382 --> 02:50:27.918 region:rollup2
OF MIST MISTER PRONE.

02:50:26.717 --> 02:50:28.652 region:rollup2
BUT KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON MISS

02:50:27.918 --> 02:50:29.119 region:rollup2
WALDRON'S QUESTION WE TALKED

02:50:28.652 --> 02:50:30.487 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:50:29.119 --> 02:50:32.155 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

02:50:30.487 --> 02:50:33.356 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS IN A PRIMARY CARE

02:50:32.155 --> 02:50:34.424 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS HAVE WHY NOT

02:50:33.356 --> 02:50:36.960 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE

02:50:34.424 --> 02:50:39.296 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS THE. IS THE LACK OF

02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:41.164 region:rollup2
OF AVAILABILITY OF SPECIALISTS

02:50:39.296 --> 02:50:43.967 region:rollup2
SO AS A PARTICIPATION PRIMARY

02:50:41.164 --> 02:50:45.969 region:rollup2
CARE. PARTICIPATION VERSES

02:50:43.967 --> 02:50:47.204 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY PRODUCE PARTICIPATION

02:50:45.969 --> 02:50:48.805 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF PRIMARY

02:50:47.204 --> 02:50:50.006 region:rollup2
CARE POSITIONS THAT PARTICIPATE

02:50:48.805 --> 02:50:51.842 region:rollup2
IN MEDI CAL VERSUS THE

02:50:50.006 --> 02:50:53.343 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF. SPECIALTY

02:50:51.842 --> 02:50:54.745 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS WHO PARTICIPATE DO

02:50:53.343 --> 02:50:56.146 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THAT NUMBER YOU'VE

02:50:54.745 --> 02:50:58.915 region:rollup2
GIVEN US UNCLOG A GROUP NUMBER

02:50:56.146 --> 02:51:00.617 region:rollup2
BUT. BUT MY INSTINCT IS THAT A

02:50:58.915 --> 02:51:02.319 region:rollup2
WHOLE LOT MORE PRIMARY CARE FOR

02:51:00.617 --> 02:51:04.688 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS PROVIDE YOU

02:51:02.319 --> 02:51:05.789 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE AND A WHOLE LOT LESS

02:51:04.688 --> 02:51:07.557 region:rollup2
SPECIALISTS IS THAT A FAIR

02:51:05.789 --> 02:51:10.327 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZATION DO YOU HAVE

02:51:07.557 --> 02:51:12.329 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER.

02:51:10.327 --> 02:51:12.496 region:rollup2
THE END IF I MISS IT I'M SORRY.

02:51:12.329 --> 02:51:13.864 region:rollup2
I'D.

02:51:12.496 --> 02:51:15.632 region:rollup2
WHICH I WILL.

02:51:13.864 --> 02:51:17.601 region:rollup2
NEED TO PULL OUT.

02:51:15.632 --> 02:51:18.602 region:rollup2
THAT DID THAT IT DOES SHOW THAT

02:51:17.601 --> 02:51:19.703 region:rollup2
WOULD THE RATIOS OF.

02:51:18.602 --> 02:51:21.404 region:rollup2
OF.

02:51:19.703 --> 02:51:22.906 region:rollup2
F. F. T. EASE A BOTH.

02:51:21.404 --> 02:51:23.974 region:rollup2
OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND

02:51:22.906 --> 02:51:27.244 region:rollup2
SPECIALISTS.

02:51:23.974 --> 02:51:29.679 region:rollup2
TO THE POPULATION WHICH IS.

02:51:27.244 --> 02:51:31.114 region:rollup2
THINK EARLY IN THIS.

02:51:29.679 --> 02:51:33.083 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE.

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:34.784 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MORE.

02:51:33.083 --> 02:51:36.019 region:rollup2
AS USE HIS OFFICE TO FIND THE

02:51:34.784 --> 02:51:37.788 region:rollup2
TWO GROUPS THERE ARE MORE

02:51:36.019 --> 02:51:40.924 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST PARTICIPATING.

02:51:37.788 --> 02:51:42.659 region:rollup2
AS A RATIO THAT YOU KNOW THAT

02:51:40.924 --> 02:51:45.228 region:rollup2
AS A RATIO TODAY AND WILL

02:51:42.659 --> 02:51:47.130 region:rollup2
POPULATION SO THAT'S I'M. ON.

02:51:45.228 --> 02:51:49.132 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE SLIGHT ELEVEN. OKAY

02:51:47.130 --> 02:51:50.767 region:rollup2
SKINNY SIDE FIVE.

02:51:49.132 --> 02:51:51.935 region:rollup2
.

02:51:50.767 --> 02:51:55.605 region:rollup2
OKAY GREAT THANK.

GO AHEAD PLEASE.

02:51:55.605 --> 02:51:58.241 region:rollup2
OKAY CAN MEET. UP TO D SO I

02:51:57.574 --> 02:51:58.909 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION BUT

02:51:58.241 --> 02:51:59.709 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

02:51:58.909 --> 02:52:01.111 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE HAVE THOSE TO BE

02:51:59.709 --> 02:52:03.213 region:rollup2
CLUMPS OF PRIMARY CARE

02:52:01.111 --> 02:52:06.183 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALS WE MASK

02:52:03.213 --> 02:52:07.517 region:rollup2
A LOT OF VARIATION. WITHIN

02:52:06.183 --> 02:52:09.186 region:rollup2
SECTION THE SPECIAL THAT WE LOOK

02:52:07.517 --> 02:52:10.654 region:rollup2
UP MORE NARROWLY EMERGENCY

02:52:09.186 --> 02:52:12.422 region:rollup2
MEDICINE PHYSICIANS NO SURPRISE

02:52:10.654 --> 02:52:13.390 region:rollup2
ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO

02:52:12.422 --> 02:52:14.558 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE

02:52:13.390 --> 02:52:16.193 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY

02:52:14.558 --> 02:52:17.827 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CHOICE

02:52:16.193 --> 02:52:19.496 region:rollup2
IN TALLEST AS IF A PATIENT

02:52:17.827 --> 02:52:21.865 region:rollup2
PRESENTS A JUROR ET ISSUE IN

02:52:19.496 --> 02:52:24.301 region:rollup2
WELL NO. MEMBER OF NAMBLA YOU'VE

INSURANCE.

02:52:27.170 --> 02:52:30.040 region:rollup2
AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM

02:52:28.138 --> 02:52:32.342 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PSYCHIATRY LOWEST RATE

02:52:30.040 --> 02:52:34.811 region:rollup2
OF PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICAL

02:52:32.342 --> 02:52:36.146 region:rollup2
PROGRAM A SPECIALITY WHERE.

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:39.316 region:rollup2
SOME FOLKS IN THE SPECIALLY

02:52:36.146 --> 02:52:40.984 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T KNOW PROTECT ANY FORM

02:52:39.316 --> 02:52:42.085 region:rollup2
OF INSURANCE YOU KNOW NOT NOT

02:52:40.984 --> 02:52:44.621 region:rollup2
NOT YOU KNOW DOESN'T MATTER

02:52:42.085 --> 02:52:46.356 region:rollup2
COULD BE THE BLUE PLATED. ANTHEM

02:52:44.621 --> 02:52:46.990 region:rollup2
PLAN THEY STILL WON'T TAKE IT.

02:52:46.356 --> 02:52:48.024 region:rollup2
SO.

02:52:46.990 --> 02:52:48.558 region:rollup2
THAT SEPARATION AND THEN AMONG

02:52:48.024 --> 02:52:50.861 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS

02:52:48.558 --> 02:52:52.162 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIANS MUCH MORE LIKELY

02:52:50.861 --> 02:52:52.662 region:rollup2
BY THE AND THE GENERAL

02:52:52.162 --> 02:52:54.931 region:rollup2
INTERNISTS IN THE FAMILY

02:52:52.662 --> 02:52:57.167 region:rollup2

THING THAT.

02:52:57.767 --> 02:53:01.104 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE SAME THINK YOU THE

02:52:59.769 --> 02:53:01.638 region:rollup2
SAME SURVEY THAT THAT JASMINE

02:53:01.104 --> 02:53:02.772 region:rollup2
APART OUT IS.

02:53:01.638 --> 02:53:04.007 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

02:53:02.772 --> 02:53:05.108 region:rollup2
THERE'S CAN SEVERAL VARIATION

02:53:04.007 --> 02:53:07.143 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHERE PEOPLE

02:53:05.108 --> 02:53:08.912 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IN THEIR PARTICIPATION

02:53:07.143 --> 02:53:11.014 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU PRACTICE IN A.

02:53:08.912 --> 02:53:12.048 region:rollup2
VERY CLEVER HEALTH CENTER

02:53:11.014 --> 02:53:13.717 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY FOR

02:53:12.048 --> 02:53:15.585 region:rollup2
SPAIN MEDICAL PROGRAM SHIHAD

02:53:13.717 --> 02:53:19.022 region:rollup2
THEN NOT AND.

02:53:15.585 --> 02:53:19.589 region:rollup2
IN CHI A KAISER DOCKS MORE SO

02:53:19.022 --> 02:53:21.625 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PRACTICE STOCKS MUCH

02:53:19.589 --> 02:53:21.791 region:rollup2
LESS SO.

02:53:21.625 --> 02:53:23.260 region:rollup2
AND.

02:53:21.791 --> 02:53:23.894 region:rollup2
TO ENFORCE ON THANK YOU IT'S

02:53:23.260 --> 02:53:24.160 region:rollup2

A PROFESSOR COUGHLIN ON THE ON

02:53:26.263 --> 02:53:29.099 region:rollup2
THE ON THE ON THE TASK FORCE WHO

02:53:27.764 --> 02:53:30.667 region:rollup2
WERE WORKING ON. THE A ONE THAT

02:53:29.099 --> 02:53:31.968 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE AGE

02:53:30.667 --> 02:53:32.569 region:rollup2
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN POSITIONS IN

02:53:31.968 --> 02:53:33.937 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TOWNS IN ONE OF MY

02:53:32.569 --> 02:53:35.405 region:rollup2
COUNTIES A FIFTY PERCENT OF

02:53:33.937 --> 02:53:36.773 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS ARE OVER THE AGE OF

02:53:35.405 --> 02:53:37.407 region:rollup2
SIXTY TWO. AND.

02:53:36.773 --> 02:53:39.142 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:53:37.407 --> 02:53:41.711 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MAY BE A HIGH NUMBER

02:53:39.142 --> 02:53:43.346 region:rollup2
FOR OTHER OTHER AREAS BUT THAT

02:53:41.711 --> 02:53:44.748 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER OF OF.

02:53:43.346 --> 02:53:47.450 region:rollup2
HIGHER AGE PHYSICIANS IN RURAL

02:53:44.748 --> 02:53:48.885 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES REALLY IS IS A IS A

02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:50.887 region:rollup2
IS A IS A REAL REALITY.

02:53:48.885 --> 02:53:52.989 region:rollup2
AS WE TRANSITION TO SINGLE

02:53:50.887 --> 02:53:53.757 region:rollup2
PAYER ON WE KNOW IN OTHER

02:53:52.989 --> 02:53:56.793 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES THAT.

02:53:53.757 --> 02:53:59.029 region:rollup2
THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE FOR

02:53:56.793 --> 02:54:00.597 region:rollup2
OF POSITIONS TO YOUR ROUGHLY I

02:53:59.029 --> 02:54:02.532 region:rollup2
MEAN AS A NUMBERS WE HEARD FROM

02:54:00.597 --> 02:54:03.667 region:rollup2
COMMONWEALTH FOLKS. OF THAT AT

02:54:02.532 --> 02:54:06.870 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT.

02:54:03.667 --> 02:54:07.771 region:rollup2
R. ARE PRINT ARE.

02:54:06.870 --> 02:54:09.539 region:rollup2
OUR EYES SPECIALIST AND SEVENTY

02:54:07.771 --> 02:54:11.508 region:rollup2
PERCENT PRIMARY CARE.

02:54:09.539 --> 02:54:12.776 region:rollup2
VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH

02:54:11.508 --> 02:54:14.444 region:rollup2
IS JUST THE OPPOSITE SEVENTY

02:54:12.776 --> 02:54:16.179 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR PHYSICIANS ARE A

02:54:14.444 --> 02:54:18.348 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY ARE SPECIALISTS IN AND

02:54:16.179 --> 02:54:19.883 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OR PRIMARY CARE.

02:54:18.348 --> 02:54:21.918 region:rollup2
ANY IDEA HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE

02:54:19.883 --> 02:54:22.952 region:rollup2
US TO TRANSITION TO TO TO DO

02:54:21.918 --> 02:54:25.588 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE YOU'VE

02:54:22.952 --> 02:54:26.556 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT VERY QUICKLY THAT WE

02:54:25.588 --> 02:54:27.757 region:rollup2
IN CáC COMPANY DON'T REALLY

02:54:26.556 --> 02:54:29.559 region:rollup2
EVEN HAVE THE CAPACITY EDUCATE.

02:54:27.757 --> 02:54:30.560 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS WE NEED TO

02:54:29.559 --> 02:54:33.229 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN OUR OWN POPULATION

02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:33.797 region:rollup2
SO.

02:54:33.229 --> 02:54:36.499 region:rollup2
THE HOW YOU KNOW HOW WE GET

02:54:33.797 --> 02:54:38.635 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:54:36.499 --> 02:54:39.669 region:rollup2
AYE I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D I'D

02:54:38.635 --> 02:54:40.870 region:rollup2
WANT TO HAZARD A GUESS BUT

02:54:39.669 --> 02:54:43.707 region:rollup2
LIKELY UP SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S

02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:45.041 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE U. S. E.

02:54:43.707 --> 02:54:47.610 region:rollup2
AND MANY OTHER.

02:54:45.041 --> 02:54:49.512 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN AND AND

02:54:47.610 --> 02:54:51.915 region:rollup2
THAT IS WE LARGELY EXPECT OUR

02:54:49.512 --> 02:54:53.249 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS TO SELF FINANCE.

02:54:51.915 --> 02:54:56.486 region:rollup2
THEIR EDUCATION CORRECT

02:54:53.249 --> 02:54:58.221 region:rollup2
I'D THEY ASSUME A LOT OF THOUGHT

02:54:56.486 --> 02:54:59.089 region:rollup2
A JET YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE E. I

02:54:58.221 --> 02:55:00.290 region:rollup2
THINK AT THIS POINT IS ABOUT

02:54:59.089 --> 02:55:01.758 region:rollup2
HUNDRED NINETIES THAT HUNDRED

02:55:00.290 --> 02:55:03.093 region:rollup2
NINETY THOUSAND.

02:55:01.758 --> 02:55:04.995 region:rollup2
.

02:55:03.093 --> 02:55:07.364 region:rollup2
IT IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES ARE

02:55:04.995 --> 02:55:09.532 region:rollup2
THE COST OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IS

02:55:07.364 --> 02:55:11.835 region:rollup2
HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED FROM YOU KNOW

02:55:09.532 --> 02:55:14.170 region:rollup2
TUITION IS MUCH.

02:55:11.835 --> 02:55:15.739 region:rollup2
UP LOW WERE FOR IT FOR MEDICAL

02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:17.941 region:rollup2
SCHOOL I'M SURE AGAIN THAT MAY

02:55:15.739 --> 02:55:18.675 region:rollup2
WELL BE ONE REASON WHY THOSE

02:55:17.941 --> 02:55:20.443 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES.

02:55:18.675 --> 02:55:22.145 region:rollup2
SUCCEED MORE INTRIGUED MORE

02:55:20.443 --> 02:55:24.414 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS.

02:55:22.145 --> 02:55:26.483 region:rollup2
STUDIES THAT LOOK AT SPECIALTY

02:55:24.414 --> 02:55:28.151 region:rollup2
CHOICE AMONG U. S. PHYSICIANS

02:55:26.483 --> 02:55:29.252 region:rollup2
SAY THAT DEBT AND FINANCE IS ONE

02:55:28.151 --> 02:55:30.687 region:rollup2
OF THE BEST SELLING UP THE ONLY

02:55:29.252 --> 02:55:32.222 region:rollup2
ONE BUT IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE

02:55:30.687 --> 02:55:34.023 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANT ONES.

02:55:32.222 --> 02:55:36.893 region:rollup2
SICKENING OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T

02:55:34.023 --> 02:55:37.594 region:rollup2
HAVE QUITE AS BIG OF A GAP OFTEN

02:55:36.893 --> 02:55:40.096 region:rollup2
IN.

02:55:37.594 --> 02:55:42.098 region:rollup2
SALARIES AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR

02:55:40.096 --> 02:55:43.867 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS

02:55:42.098 --> 02:55:45.668 region:rollup2
AN OUNCE BEYOND SPECIALISTS SO

02:55:43.867 --> 02:55:48.104 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE OF IT ARE

02:55:45.668 --> 02:55:50.006 region:rollup2
IN AND SECONDLY I THINK AND YOU

02:55:48.104 --> 02:55:51.374 region:rollup2
KNOW I SAY THIS IS. YOU KNOW AS

02:55:50.006 --> 02:55:51.941 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THE

02:55:51.374 --> 02:55:52.509 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THAT I

02:55:51.941 --> 02:55:53.910 region:rollup2
THINK WE.

02:55:52.509 --> 02:55:55.478 region:rollup2
WE OFTEN IN THE WAY OUR

02:55:53.910 --> 02:55:58.381 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS OUR EDUCATED WE

02:55:55.478 --> 02:56:00.050 region:rollup2
EDUCATE IN A WAY. THAT IT SENDS

02:55:58.381 --> 02:56:02.619 region:rollup2
A MESSAGE TO OUR MEDICAL

02:56:00.050 --> 02:56:04.320 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT SPECIALTY CARE IS

02:56:02.619 --> 02:56:05.622 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S AT YOU DON'T WANT TO

02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:06.689 region:rollup2
BE A PRIMARY COOPER AND SO

02:56:05.622 --> 02:56:08.058 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT CULTURE CHANGE I

02:56:06.689 --> 02:56:10.326 region:rollup2
THINK ACTUALLY THAT'S THE

02:56:08.058 --> 02:56:13.496 region:rollup2
HARDEST THAT'S EVEN HARDER. THAN

02:56:10.326 --> 02:56:15.432 region:rollup2
X. THEN EXPANDING. CAPACITY

02:56:13.496 --> 02:56:17.434 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZING EDUCATION.

02:56:15.432 --> 02:56:18.501 region:rollup2
AND AND CHANGING REVERSED WHICH

02:56:17.434 --> 02:56:19.202 region:rollup2
ARE HEAVY LIFTS THE CALLED THE

02:56:18.501 --> 02:56:19.936 region:rollup2
UP BUT THE HARDEST THING

02:56:19.202 --> 02:56:22.972 region:rollup2
SOMETIME IS TO CHANGE.

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:23.873 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS.

02:56:22.972 --> 02:56:25.708 region:rollup2
AND THE FINAL QUESTION I HAVE

02:56:23.873 --> 02:56:26.810 region:rollup2
FOR A PROFESSOR GRAVES.

02:56:25.708 --> 02:56:28.077 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:56:26.810 --> 02:56:28.745 region:rollup2
SEE YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOUR

02:56:28.077 --> 02:56:31.347 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

02:56:28.745 --> 02:56:32.415 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WE'RE LOOKING AT THE.

02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:34.784 region:rollup2
I USE THE WORD BYZANTINE.

02:56:32.415 --> 02:56:36.286 region:rollup2
NETWORK OF OF OF PEOPLE HOW

02:56:34.784 --> 02:56:37.754 region:rollup2
THEY GET CARE BASED ON THEIR ON

02:56:36.286 --> 02:56:38.988 region:rollup2
PLANS AND AND AND NETWORKS.

02:56:37.754 --> 02:56:40.290 region:rollup2
.

02:56:38.988 --> 02:56:42.158 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK IT BE HELPFUL TO

02:56:40.290 --> 02:56:43.660 region:rollup2
REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO HAVE THE

02:56:42.158 --> 02:56:44.828 region:rollup2
SAME NETWORK. OF PROVIDERS FOR

02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:47.497 region:rollup2
ALL THE PLANTS.

02:56:44.828 --> 02:56:48.565 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:56:47.497 --> 02:56:49.399 region:rollup2
I WOULD START WITH THE PRINCIPLE

02:56:48.565 --> 02:56:51.267 region:rollup2
I WOULD START WITH IS JUST

02:56:49.399 --> 02:56:53.069 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND ACCURACY.

02:56:51.267 --> 02:56:55.071 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE FIRST STEP IS TO

02:56:53.069 --> 02:56:55.371 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WHATEVER NETWORK

02:56:55.071 --> 02:56:59.042 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

02:56:55.371 --> 02:56:59.442 region:rollup2
THE THE PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING A

02:56:59.042 --> 02:57:01.544 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:56:59.442 --> 02:57:03.313 region:rollup2
BASED ON GOOD IN CURRENT UP TO

02:57:01.544 --> 02:57:05.281 region:rollup2
DATE INFORMATION.

02:57:03.313 --> 02:57:07.317 region:rollup2
SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST IF

02:57:05.281 --> 02:57:09.385 region:rollup2
IF I WOULD GO DOWN THE ROAD.

02:57:07.317 --> 02:57:10.186 region:rollup2
OF NETWORK REGULATION THAT

02:57:09.385 --> 02:57:12.288 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP THAT I

02:57:10.186 --> 02:57:12.555 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE IN THAT PROCESS.

02:57:12.288 --> 02:57:13.389 region:rollup2
THERE IS.

02:57:12.555 --> 02:57:15.458 region:rollup2
.

02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:16.726 region:rollup2
.

02:57:15.458 --> 02:57:18.061 region:rollup2
SOME BENEFIT TO HAVING

02:57:16.726 --> 02:57:20.096 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZE NETWORKS ON THE

02:57:18.061 --> 02:57:21.731 region:rollup2
OTHER HAND IT HAS BEEN PROVEN.

02:57:20.096 --> 02:57:23.633 region:rollup2
ARE AT IT IS SHOWN THAT

02:57:21.731 --> 02:57:25.535 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHEN SURVEYED ARE

02:57:23.633 --> 02:57:26.636 region:rollup2
WILLING TO SELECT A PLAN THERE

02:57:25.535 --> 02:57:27.871 region:rollup2
WILLING TO MAKE THE TRADE OFF

02:57:26.636 --> 02:57:29.105 region:rollup2
BETWEEN AN AIR OR NETWORK IN A

02:57:27.871 --> 02:57:29.739 region:rollup2
LOWER PREMIUM.

02:57:29.105 --> 02:57:30.974 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:57:29.739 --> 02:57:32.442 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY HAVE TO KEEP THOSE

02:57:30.974 --> 02:57:33.476 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN MIND.

02:57:32.442 --> 02:57:35.845 region:rollup2
WIN.

02:57:33.476 --> 02:57:37.614 region:rollup2
WHEN THINKING ABOUT STE EITHER

02:57:35.845 --> 02:57:38.715 region:rollup2
STANDARDIZING NETWORK SOBRE ARE

02:57:37.614 --> 02:57:39.883 region:rollup2
ARE MANDATING CERTAIN NETWORK

02:57:38.715 --> 02:57:41.084 region:rollup2
SIZES.

02:57:39.883 --> 02:57:42.986 region:rollup2
YOU CAN THINK OF.

02:57:41.084 --> 02:57:45.522 region:rollup2
IN THIS XIN LIKE KAISER.

02:57:42.986 --> 02:57:46.089 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE A REQUIRING THEM TO

02:57:45.522 --> 02:57:48.224 region:rollup2
TAKE ON MORE PROVIDERS THAN

02:57:46.089 --> 02:57:50.393 region:rollup2
THEY.

02:57:48.224 --> 02:57:52.128 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY WOULD OTHERWISE.

02:57:50.393 --> 02:57:53.897 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE CONTRACTING WITH

02:57:52.128 --> 02:57:55.365 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH

02:57:53.897 --> 02:57:56.733 region:rollup2
THEIR INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

02:57:55.365 --> 02:57:58.535 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR CARE GUIDELINES

02:57:56.733 --> 02:57:59.435 region:rollup2
ETCETERA SO THEY ARE CHALLENGES

02:57:58.535 --> 02:58:01.337 region:rollup2
TO.

02:57:59.435 --> 02:58:02.472 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SPEAK TO ISSUES OF

02:58:01.337 --> 02:58:03.506 region:rollup2
QUALITY.

02:58:02.472 --> 02:58:05.175 region:rollup2
AND COSTS.

02:58:03.506 --> 02:58:07.143 region:rollup2
THEIR TRADE OFFS.

02:58:05.175 --> 02:58:08.378 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:10.847 region:rollup2
IT WITH ANY KIND OF.

02:58:08.378 --> 02:58:11.381 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY STRONG MOVE

02:58:10.847 --> 02:58:14.384 region:rollup2
TOWARDS.

02:58:11.381 --> 02:58:15.318 region:rollup2
KIND OF MANDATED NETWORK.

02:58:14.384 --> 02:58:16.953 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT'S IT'S BEDEVIL THIS

02:58:15.318 --> 02:58:18.521 region:rollup2
FOR YEARS IN CALIFORNIA TO TRY

02:58:16.953 --> 02:58:19.923 region:rollup2
TO GET UP TO DATE PROVIDER

02:58:18.521 --> 02:58:21.958 region:rollup2
NETWORKS IS OFTEN THE CASE THE

02:58:19.923 --> 02:58:23.660 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

02:58:21.958 --> 02:58:25.528 region:rollup2
PLAN THEY BELONG TO A. FRIEND

02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:27.330 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR FOR

02:58:25.528 --> 02:58:29.832 region:rollup2
FOR CONSUMERS FOR PATIENTS.

02:58:27.330 --> 02:58:30.667 region:rollup2
WHO ARE YOU MAY THINK THAT

02:58:29.832 --> 02:58:31.901 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY RECOVERED AND IT

02:58:30.667 --> 02:58:33.703 region:rollup2
WAS A BIG? BIG CHALLENGE WE WERE

02:58:31.901 --> 02:58:35.104 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE ON HOW TO GET RID

02:58:33.703 --> 02:58:37.073 region:rollup2
OF THE SURPRISE BILLING ISSUE IN

02:58:35.104 --> 02:58:38.374 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE. IT'S SO

02:58:37.073 --> 02:58:40.009 region:rollup2
CONFUSING OUT THERE AND IN THIS

02:58:38.374 --> 02:58:40.843 region:rollup2
DAY AND AGE WITH ALL THE

02:58:40.009 --> 02:58:42.278 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE.

02:58:40.843 --> 02:58:44.180 region:rollup2
TO NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCURATE

02:58:42.278 --> 02:58:47.016 region:rollup2
PROVIDER NETWORKS IS IS IS

02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:48.184 region:rollup2
REALLY CONFOUNDING QUITE FRAIL

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:49.919 region:rollup2
AYE I LIKE IN IS THAT IF YOU ASK

02:58:48.184 --> 02:58:51.054 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY TO GET FROM. HERE TO

02:58:49.919 --> 02:58:52.021 region:rollup2
ANY POINT IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

02:58:51.054 --> 02:58:53.890 region:rollup2
AKIN TO.

02:58:52.021 --> 02:58:55.658 region:rollup2
GIVING THEM A MAP FROM NINETEEN

02:58:53.890 --> 02:58:57.193 region:rollup2
FIFTY. AS OPPOSED TO LETTING

02:58:55.658 --> 02:58:58.061 region:rollup2
THEM USE GOOGLE MAPS YOU KNOW IF

02:58:57.193 --> 02:58:59.929 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA GET THERE

02:58:58.061 --> 02:59:01.230 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY BUT THEY'RE GONNA GET

02:58:59.929 --> 02:59:03.600 region:rollup2
LOST ALONG THE WAY THE BUT IT'S

02:59:01.230 --> 02:59:05.001 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE CHANGED SO EXACTLY

02:59:03.600 --> 02:59:08.037 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE POINT.

02:59:05.001 --> 02:59:09.806 region:rollup2
IF YOU REMAIN.

02:59:08.037 --> 02:59:12.475 region:rollup2
FIRST I'D

02:59:09.806 --> 02:59:15.044 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT TO APPRECIATE THE.

02:59:12.475 --> 02:59:15.745 region:rollup2
DANCE AND.

02:59:15.044 --> 02:59:17.981 region:rollup2
TEASE THAT YOU BRING TO THE

02:59:15.745 --> 02:59:19.916 region:rollup2
TABLE HERE TODAY.

02:59:17.981 --> 02:59:21.651 region:rollup2
NICE TO ACTUALLY GET BACK TO

02:59:19.916 --> 02:59:22.986 region:rollup2
WORK AND REALLY FOCUS ON.

02:59:21.651 --> 02:59:25.088 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT FACE EVERY DAY

02:59:22.986 --> 02:59:26.322 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

02:59:25.088 --> 02:59:28.191 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO START MY QUESTIONS

02:59:26.322 --> 02:59:28.825 region:rollup2
BY.

02:59:28.191 --> 02:59:30.126 region:rollup2
WITH YOU SABRINA CORRELATE IF I

02:59:28.825 --> 02:59:31.661 region:rollup2
COULD PLEASE

02:59:30.126 --> 02:59:34.197 region:rollup2
AND I'M GONNA GO DOWN IN ORDER

02:59:31.661 --> 02:59:35.865 region:rollup2
THAT YOU PRESENTED.

02:59:34.197 --> 02:59:38.668 region:rollup2
YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT.

02:59:35.865 --> 02:59:40.903 region:rollup2
NETWORKS WHERE THE MAIN DRIVER

02:59:38.668 --> 02:59:43.773 region:rollup2
FOR INCREASES IN PRICE ARE OTHER

02:59:40.903 --> 02:59:46.075 region:rollup2
STATES DOING AND MANAGING THAT

02:59:43.773 --> 02:59:49.679 region:rollup2
WORKS DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO.

02:59:46.075 --> 02:59:50.680 region:rollup2
WHAT COULD WE LEARN FROM THEIR?

02:59:49.679 --> 02:59:52.548 region:rollup2
SURE WELL.

02:59:50.680 --> 02:59:54.317 region:rollup2
I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW WHETHER IT

02:59:52.548 --> 02:59:56.719 region:rollup2
WAS A CRISIS OR JOHN WHO TALKED

02:59:54.317 --> 02:59:58.421 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE OF NETWORK.

02:59:56.719 --> 03:00:00.490 region:rollup2
REGULATION IS REALLY A STATE

02:59:58.421 --> 03:00:02.325 region:rollup2
LEVEL ISSUE FOR THE MOST PART

03:00:00.490 --> 03:00:03.459 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY THAT. THE VAST

03:00:02.325 --> 03:00:05.728 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF STATES ARE

03:00:03.459 --> 03:00:07.163 region:rollup2
DO NOT HEAVILY REGULATE NETWORKS

03:00:05.728 --> 03:00:08.798 region:rollup2
AT LEAST IN THE INDIVIDUAL

03:00:07.163 --> 03:00:11.601 region:rollup2
MARKET OR THE MARKETPLACE SAYS.

03:00:08.798 --> 03:00:13.636 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IN THIS PAST YEAR

03:00:11.601 --> 03:00:15.305 region:rollup2
WHERE WE SAW A LOT OF AREAS OF

03:00:13.636 --> 03:00:17.440 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY THAT WERE AT RISK OF

03:00:15.305 --> 03:00:18.908 region:rollup2
LOSING THEIR INSURERS. ON MANY

03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:20.743 region:rollup2
STATES RELAXED THEIR NETWORK

03:00:18.908 --> 03:00:22.679 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY STANDARDS SO FOR

03:00:20.743 --> 03:00:24.414 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE IN SOME OF THE COUNTIES

03:00:22.679 --> 03:00:26.115 region:rollup2
IN OHIO THAT WERE AT RISK THERE

03:00:24.414 --> 03:00:27.750 region:rollup2
WERE REAL CHALLENGES THAT THE

03:00:26.115 --> 03:00:29.052 region:rollup2
CARRIERS FACED IN CONTRACTING

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:30.753 region:rollup2
WITH.

03:00:29.052 --> 03:00:31.888 region:rollup2
OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND AND

03:00:30.753 --> 03:00:33.356 region:rollup2
PROVIDER GROUPS THAT HAD

03:00:31.888 --> 03:00:35.658 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE MONOPOLIES IN THESE

03:00:33.356 --> 03:00:37.260 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS AND SO TO THE STATE

03:00:35.658 --> 03:00:38.695 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY SAID OKAY WELL WE

03:00:37.260 --> 03:00:41.597 region:rollup2
WILL LET YOU FOR EXAMPLE

03:00:38.695 --> 03:00:43.433 region:rollup2
CONTRACT WITHOUT IT INDIANA. AT

03:00:41.597 --> 03:00:44.967 region:rollup2
PROVIDER SYSTEM INSTEAD AND

03:00:43.433 --> 03:00:47.070 region:rollup2
THOSE FOLKS IN OHIO ARE GONNA

03:00:44.967 --> 03:00:48.337 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO ACROSS STATE LINES TO

03:00:47.070 --> 03:00:49.872 region:rollup2
TO GET THEIR CARE SAID THERE

03:00:48.337 --> 03:00:51.607 region:rollup2
WERE WAS DEFINITELY SOME

03:00:49.872 --> 03:00:54.110 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY GIVEN TO THE

03:00:51.607 --> 03:00:56.479 region:rollup2
CARRIERS ON THAT ISSUE. JUST TO

03:00:54.110 --> 03:00:58.681 region:rollup2
GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE.

03:00:56.479 --> 03:01:01.117 region:rollup2
DON'T MEAN TO GENERALIZE BUT IT

03:00:58.681 --> 03:01:02.485 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE YOUR TESTIMONY.

03:01:01.117 --> 03:01:04.454 region:rollup2
WOULD STATE THAT MORE INSURANCE

03:01:02.485 --> 03:01:05.922 region:rollup2
CHOICE.

03:01:04.454 --> 03:01:08.458 region:rollup2
BENEFITS INCREASING

03:01:05.922 --> 03:01:09.659 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY.

03:01:08.458 --> 03:01:11.260 region:rollup2
WELL IS WHEN IT COMES TO THE

03:01:09.659 --> 03:01:12.695 region:rollup2
MARKET PLACES THERE IS PRETTY

03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:14.964 region:rollup2
STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE MORE

03:01:12.695 --> 03:01:17.934 region:rollup2
INSURERS ARE THAT ARE COMPETING.

03:01:14.964 --> 03:01:20.536 region:rollup2
AND THE LOWER THE PREMIUM FOR

03:01:17.934 --> 03:01:22.305 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER. AND THE LOWER THE

03:01:20.536 --> 03:01:24.507 region:rollup2
ANNUAL PREMIUM INCREASES SO YOUR

03:01:22.305 --> 03:01:27.377 region:rollup2
DATA THOUGH ALSO SEEMS TO SHOW

03:01:24.507 --> 03:01:29.545 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA WAS HAVING

03:01:27.377 --> 03:01:31.814 region:rollup2
DECREASING NUMBER OF.

03:01:29.545 --> 03:01:33.883 region:rollup2
COMPETITORS WITHIN THE INSURANCE

03:01:31.814 --> 03:01:35.318 region:rollup2
MARKET IS IT THEN. SAFE TO SAY

03:01:33.883 --> 03:01:36.953 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE DECREASING

03:01:35.318 --> 03:01:38.888 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY AS WELLAS

03:01:36.953 --> 03:01:41.257 region:rollup2
DECREASING QUALITY WELL

03:01:38.888 --> 03:01:42.125 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE AND THE CALIFORNIA.

03:01:41.257 --> 03:01:43.826 region:rollup2
COURT CALIFORNIA'S HAD PRETTY

03:01:42.125 --> 03:01:45.027 region:rollup2
STABLE ENSURE PARTICIPATION ON

03:01:43.826 --> 03:01:47.397 region:rollup2
AVERAGE.

03:01:45.027 --> 03:01:48.364 region:rollup2
BUT OF COURSE THAT MASK SOME

03:01:47.397 --> 03:01:51.033 region:rollup2
PRETTY BIG REGIONAL DIFFERENCES

03:01:48.364 --> 03:01:52.602 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE ON IT YOU KNOW WE

03:01:51.033 --> 03:01:53.703 region:rollup2
SAW MUCH HIGHER PREMIUM

03:01:52.602 --> 03:01:54.604 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN THE NORTHERN%

03:01:53.703 --> 03:01:57.874 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

03:01:54.604 --> 03:01:58.808 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR THAN IN MORE URBAN

03:01:57.874 --> 03:02:01.677 region:rollup2
AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO

03:01:58.808 --> 03:02:03.179 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO AND NOT MAYBE AND I

03:02:01.677 --> 03:02:04.747 region:rollup2
CAN'T SAY DEFINITIVELY FOR SURE

03:02:03.179 --> 03:02:07.784 region:rollup2
BUT THAT MAY BE A FUNCTION OF

03:02:04.747 --> 03:02:09.719 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF. BOTH PROVIDER AND

03:02:07.784 --> 03:02:12.155 region:rollup2
INSURER CHOICE.

03:02:09.719 --> 03:02:14.190 region:rollup2
DOVE TAILS HERE NOW ON TO WHAT

03:02:12.155 --> 03:02:16.859 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WHAT IS SAYING.

03:02:14.190 --> 03:02:18.928 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO DO A PUBLIC OPTION

03:02:16.859 --> 03:02:21.664 region:rollup2
OR TO LOOK AT A MEDI CAL BY.

03:02:18.928 --> 03:02:23.232 region:rollup2
DOES THAT HELP TO INCREASE

03:02:21.664 --> 03:02:25.701 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY BY

03:02:23.232 --> 03:02:27.370 region:rollup2
HAVING MORE OPTIONS ON.

03:02:25.701 --> 03:02:28.738 region:rollup2
WELL IT COULD BUT AGAIN THE

03:02:27.370 --> 03:02:30.740 region:rollup2
DEVIL WILL BE IN THE DETAILS ON

03:02:28.738 --> 03:02:32.942 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH WILL PROVIDERS BE PAID

03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:35.244 region:rollup2
BY THE PUBLIC OPTION PLAN.

03:02:32.942 --> 03:02:35.978 region:rollup2
WHAT PROVIDERS WILL BE AND THE

03:02:35.244 --> 03:02:40.583 region:rollup2
NETWORK?

03:02:35.978 --> 03:02:42.652 region:rollup2
WILL PUBLIC OPTION PLAN DETER

03:02:40.583 --> 03:02:44.554 region:rollup2
OTHER INSURERS PRIVATE INSURERS

03:02:42.652 --> 03:02:46.389 region:rollup2
FROM COMING IN THEM THAT MIGHT

03:02:44.554 --> 03:02:47.657 region:rollup2
COME IN OTHERWISE SO THOSE ARE

03:02:46.389 --> 03:02:49.759 region:rollup2
ALL SORT OF ISSUES YOU TO SORT

03:02:47.657 --> 03:02:52.094 region:rollup2
OF THINK THROUGH AND AS YOU

03:02:49.759 --> 03:02:53.763 region:rollup2
DESIGN SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

03:02:52.094 --> 03:02:55.631 region:rollup2
FROM FINALLY THESE RATING

03:02:53.763 --> 03:02:57.133 region:rollup2
REGIONS THAT YOU REFERENCED THE

03:02:55.631 --> 03:02:58.434 region:rollup2
NINE TEEN OF THEM.

03:02:57.133 --> 03:03:00.703 region:rollup2
CAN YOU EXTRAPOLATE A LITTLE BIT

03:02:58.434 --> 03:03:02.471 region:rollup2
MORE ON THAT THAT'S A NEW.

03:03:00.703 --> 03:03:04.774 region:rollup2
TERM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR

03:03:02.471 --> 03:03:06.542 region:rollup2
MORE YEAH SURE SO AS YOU MAY

03:03:04.774 --> 03:03:07.844 region:rollup2
RECALL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

03:03:06.542 --> 03:03:08.911 region:rollup2
INCLUDED A NUMBER OF CONSUMER

03:03:07.844 --> 03:03:11.414 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS.

03:03:08.911 --> 03:03:13.115 region:rollup2
INCLUDING LIMITS ON HOW MUCH

03:03:11.414 --> 03:03:14.584 region:rollup2
INTEREST CAN VARY THE PREMIUM

03:03:13.115 --> 03:03:15.985 region:rollup2
RATES THAT THEY CHARGE CONSUMERS

03:03:14.584 --> 03:03:18.421 region:rollup2
TO FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN'T CHANGE

03:03:15.985 --> 03:03:21.357 region:rollup2
RATES BASED ON. HEALTH STATUS OR

03:03:18.421 --> 03:03:22.758 region:rollup2
GENDER THERE'S LIMITS ON AGE

03:03:21.357 --> 03:03:24.560 region:rollup2
THERE ALSO LIMITS ON.

03:03:22.758 --> 03:03:25.528 region:rollup2
IDEA THEY ARE ALLOWED TO RATE

03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:27.196 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE

03:03:25.528 --> 03:03:28.130 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC REGION THAT THEY'RE

03:03:27.196 --> 03:03:30.066 region:rollup2
COVERING.

03:03:28.130 --> 03:03:31.968 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE LIMITS SO FOR

03:03:30.066 --> 03:03:33.836 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THEY CAN'T TAKE A TINY

03:03:31.968 --> 03:03:35.338 region:rollup2
SLICE OF LOS ANGELES AND SAY

03:03:33.836 --> 03:03:36.405 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA CHARGE.

03:03:35.338 --> 03:03:38.207 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

03:03:36.405 --> 03:03:39.876 region:rollup2
HERE AND ANOTHER SLICE OF LOS

03:03:38.207 --> 03:03:40.810 region:rollup2
ANGELES AND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

03:03:39.876 --> 03:03:43.045 region:rollup2
THERE.

03:03:40.810 --> 03:03:44.347 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS WITH US EACH STATE

03:03:43.045 --> 03:03:46.716 region:rollup2
WAS TOLD TO COME UP WITH WHAT

03:03:44.347 --> 03:03:48.718 region:rollup2
ARE CALLED RATING REACH AND SO.

03:03:46.716 --> 03:03:50.553 region:rollup2
WHILE CARRIERS ARE ALLOWED TO

03:03:48.718 --> 03:03:52.855 region:rollup2
VERY RATES BASED ON.

03:03:50.553 --> 03:03:54.590 region:rollup2
THE GEOGRAPHY THEY CAN ONLY DO

03:03:52.855 --> 03:03:57.693 region:rollup2
IT WITHIN LIMITS CALIFORNIA SET

03:03:54.590 --> 03:04:00.062 region:rollup2
UP NINETEEN RATING REGIONS.

03:03:57.693 --> 03:04:02.231 region:rollup2
AND I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN HOW

03:04:00.062 --> 03:04:03.566 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DESIGN THOSE RATING

03:04:02.231 --> 03:04:04.600 region:rollup2
REASONS OR WHAT WHAT.

03:04:03.566 --> 03:04:06.469 region:rollup2
SYPHAC FACTORS THE USED BUT

03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:08.037 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY IT'S.

03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:09.872 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW KNOWING THAT FOR

03:04:08.037 --> 03:04:12.008 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS

03:04:09.872 --> 03:04:13.676 region:rollup2
AND MUCH HIGHER PROVIDER PRICES

03:04:12.008 --> 03:04:14.577 region:rollup2
AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO

03:04:13.676 --> 03:04:15.578 region:rollup2
THAT'S IT'S A DESIGNED TO

03:04:14.577 --> 03:04:16.279 region:rollup2
REFLECT THOSE DIFFERENCES IN

03:04:15.578 --> 03:04:19.382 region:rollup2
PROVIDER BECAUSE.

03:04:16.279 --> 03:04:20.449 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY.

03:04:19.382 --> 03:04:21.784 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA COME BACK TO IT BUT

03:04:20.449 --> 03:04:23.019 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING NOW IF SOME OF

03:04:21.784 --> 03:04:24.921 region:rollup2
THOSE READING REGION'S MAY

03:04:23.019 --> 03:04:26.522 region:rollup2
PRECIPITATE WHAT WE'RE SEEING

03:04:24.921 --> 03:04:29.225 region:rollup2
WITH THEN PROVIDERS IN REGIONS

03:04:26.522 --> 03:04:31.694 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

03:04:29.225 --> 03:04:32.028 region:rollup2
GEORGE THINK IF I MAY I'D LIKE

03:04:31.694 --> 03:04:33.429 region:rollup2
TO MOVE ON TO.

03:04:32.028 --> 03:04:35.298 region:rollup2
.

03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:36.532 region:rollup2
MR PRODI. UP.

03:04:35.298 --> 03:04:36.966 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I REALLY WANTED TO DO

03:04:36.532 --> 03:04:37.233 region:rollup2
IN ON THIS BECAUSE.

03:04:36.966 --> 03:04:39.168 region:rollup2
.

03:04:37.233 --> 03:04:41.404 region:rollup2
YOU SAID THAT.

03:04:39.168 --> 03:04:42.905 region:rollup2
THE PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION IN

03:04:41.404 --> 03:04:44.574 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL IS INSUFFICIENT AND HAS

03:04:42.905 --> 03:04:46.442 region:rollup2
NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE

03:04:44.574 --> 03:04:48.911 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

03:04:46.442 --> 03:04:50.947 region:rollup2
CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT STATE AND

03:04:48.911 --> 03:04:52.615 region:rollup2
FEDERAL POSITION TO PATIENT

03:04:50.947 --> 03:04:54.216 region:rollup2
RATIOS WE ARE NOT MEETING AS A

03:04:52.615 --> 03:04:55.585 region:rollup2
STATE AND.

03:04:54.216 --> 03:05:00.456 region:rollup2
DOES THAT PUT AT RISK ANY FUNDS

03:04:55.585 --> 03:05:02.758 region:rollup2
FOR US AS.

03:05:00.456 --> 03:05:03.693 region:rollup2
WELL THERE WERE SOME NATIONAL A

03:05:02.758 --> 03:05:04.927 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES.

03:05:03.693 --> 03:05:06.228 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNCIL ON

03:05:04.927 --> 03:05:09.999 region:rollup2
GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION.

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:11.968 region:rollup2
QUITE SOMETIME AGO.

03:05:09.999 --> 03:05:13.436 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE THE FEDERAL

03:05:11.968 --> 03:05:15.404 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND I'M REFERRING TO

03:05:13.436 --> 03:05:16.872 region:rollup2
THE STATE THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTH

03:05:15.404 --> 03:05:17.306 region:rollup2
CARE SERVICES.

03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:19.875 region:rollup2
FOR PRIMARY CARE HAS

03:05:17.306 --> 03:05:24.213 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED.

03:05:19.875 --> 03:05:26.682 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE TO MEMBER RATIOS

03:05:24.213 --> 03:05:28.718 region:rollup2
FOR ITS MANAGED CARE PLANS.

03:05:26.682 --> 03:05:29.986 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE STATE RATIO THAT

03:05:28.718 --> 03:05:32.688 region:rollup2
I'M REFERRING TO.

03:05:29.986 --> 03:05:33.689 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT.

03:05:32.688 --> 03:05:35.324 region:rollup2
LARGE EXPANSION AND.

03:05:33.689 --> 03:05:37.994 region:rollup2
.

03:05:35.324 --> 03:05:39.028 region:rollup2
MEDICAL PROGRAM.

03:05:37.994 --> 03:05:40.529 region:rollup2
HOW WE GOING SEEN A RELATIVELY

03:05:39.028 --> 03:05:41.831 region:rollup2
MODEST EXPANSION IN THE NUMBER

03:05:40.529 --> 03:05:43.032 region:rollup2
OF PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATING OR

03:05:41.831 --> 03:05:44.266 region:rollup2
AT LEAST IN THE SHARE OF THEIR

03:05:43.032 --> 03:05:46.502 region:rollup2
TIME PARTICIPATING?

03:05:44.266 --> 03:05:48.371 region:rollup2
?

03:05:46.502 --> 03:05:50.039 region:rollup2
IN IN MEDI CAL AYE AND SORT

03:05:48.371 --> 03:05:51.707 region:rollup2
HASN'T KEPT PACE

03:05:50.039 --> 03:05:54.844 region:rollup2
A TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE

03:05:51.707 --> 03:05:57.146 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT. PUTTING AT RISK ANY.

03:05:54.844 --> 03:06:00.516 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FUNDS PER SE.

03:05:57.146 --> 03:06:03.052 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION

03:06:00.516 --> 03:06:04.987 region:rollup2
THERE WAS.

03:06:03.052 --> 03:06:06.589 region:rollup2
QUITE A CLOSE LOOK.

03:06:04.987 --> 03:06:08.691 region:rollup2
BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON

03:06:06.589 --> 03:06:11.127 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS ISSUES THERE

03:06:08.691 --> 03:06:12.995 region:rollup2
WAS SOME MANDATED STUDIES THAT

03:06:11.127 --> 03:06:14.263 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MUST DO. THINK THE

03:06:12.995 --> 03:06:15.765 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SUPPORT AS WELL

03:06:14.263 --> 03:06:17.733 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT CALIFORNIA'S

03:06:15.765 --> 03:06:19.168 region:rollup2
MANDATED TO DO BECAUSE THEY WERE

03:06:17.733 --> 03:06:22.038 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT.

03:06:19.168 --> 03:06:24.340 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND HOW IT MIGHT.

03:06:22.038 --> 03:06:25.608 region:rollup2
CHANGE AFTER THE EXPANSION.

03:06:24.340 --> 03:06:26.842 region:rollup2
AND AND FRANKLY THERE WERE

03:06:25.608 --> 03:06:29.111 region:rollup2
CONCERNS EVEN BEFORE THE

03:06:26.842 --> 03:06:30.179 region:rollup2
EXPANSION ABOUT ACCESS AND MEDI

03:06:29.111 --> 03:06:31.981 region:rollup2
CAL SO.

03:06:30.179 --> 03:06:33.816 region:rollup2
.

03:06:31.981 --> 03:06:35.217 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN AT TIMES FEDERAL

03:06:33.816 --> 03:06:36.018 region:rollup2
PRESSURE OR TO ON CALIFORNIA

03:06:35.217 --> 03:06:37.887 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:06:36.018 --> 03:06:39.822 region:rollup2
ENSURING APPROPRIATE ACCESS

03:06:37.887 --> 03:06:40.589 region:rollup2
BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

03:06:39.822 --> 03:06:42.058 region:rollup2
THERE HOW MANY FEDERAL

03:06:40.589 --> 03:06:44.627 region:rollup2
PENALTIES.

03:06:42.058 --> 03:06:45.995 region:rollup2
FOR NOT BEING AS REQUIREMENTS.

03:06:44.627 --> 03:06:47.697 region:rollup2
YOU EARLIER YOU HAD MENTIONED

03:06:45.995 --> 03:06:49.699 region:rollup2
THAT PUBLIC PLANS WERE DOING A

03:06:47.697 --> 03:06:52.068 region:rollup2
BETTER JOB OF INVESTING.

03:06:49.699 --> 03:06:52.702 region:rollup2
INTO TARGETED PROGRAMS TO EXPAND

03:06:52.068 --> 03:06:54.437 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CHURCH SEEMS LIKE THIS

03:06:52.702 --> 03:06:56.672 region:rollup2
IS.

03:06:54.437 --> 03:06:58.841 region:rollup2
A WAY TO ENCOURAGE.

03:06:56.672 --> 03:07:00.476 region:rollup2
THOSE PUBLIC PLANS TO MAKE SURE

03:06:58.841 --> 03:07:02.211 region:rollup2
THAT WERE TRAINING OF THE

03:07:00.476 --> 03:07:03.579 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW

03:07:02.211 --> 03:07:05.347 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN REGIONS LIKE

03:07:03.579 --> 03:07:07.416 region:rollup2
MINE.

03:07:05.347 --> 03:07:07.950 region:rollup2
THE NEXT QUESTION I WAS HOPING

03:07:07.416 --> 03:07:09.952 region:rollup2
TO ASK.

03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:10.820 region:rollup2
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE

03:07:09.952 --> 03:07:12.321 region:rollup2
LEARNED THAT FIVE TO TEN

03:07:10.820 --> 03:07:14.090 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

03:07:12.321 --> 03:07:15.191 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL THE COVERED CALIFORNIA

03:07:14.090 --> 03:07:16.926 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WERE CHURNING EACH

03:07:15.191 --> 03:07:18.260 region:rollup2
MONTH.

03:07:16.926 --> 03:07:19.895 region:rollup2
ARE THERE THINGS THAT MEDI CAL

03:07:18.260 --> 03:07:21.764 region:rollup2
OR COVERED CALIFORNIA COULD DO

03:07:19.895 --> 03:07:23.232 region:rollup2
TO BETTER.

03:07:21.764 --> 03:07:27.603 region:rollup2
TO BETTER PREVENT INDIVIDUALS

03:07:23.232 --> 03:07:28.838 region:rollup2
FROM HAVING GAPS IN COVERAGE.

03:07:27.603 --> 03:07:30.439 region:rollup2
BUT I KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF

03:07:28.838 --> 03:07:32.208 region:rollup2
EFFORTS ALREADY UNDER WAY. TIMES

03:07:30.439 --> 03:07:33.008 region:rollup2
WHEN THINGS.

03:07:32.208 --> 03:07:33.976 region:rollup2
THERE'S IT YOU KNOW THERE'S

03:07:33.008 --> 03:07:35.244 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN A NUMBER OF EFFORTS

03:07:33.976 --> 03:07:36.045 region:rollup2
UNDER WAY AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:07:35.244 --> 03:07:38.747 region:rollup2
LEVEL TO.

03:07:36.045 --> 03:07:41.150 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE THOSE HANDOFFS.

03:07:38.747 --> 03:07:42.084 region:rollup2
WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE COVERAGE

03:07:41.150 --> 03:07:44.787 region:rollup2
EITHER.

03:07:42.084 --> 03:07:46.388 region:rollup2
.

03:07:44.787 --> 03:07:47.490 region:rollup2
THEIR INCOMES GO UP IN THERE.

03:07:46.388 --> 03:07:48.791 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NO LONGER HALOGEN FOR

03:07:47.490 --> 03:07:50.459 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL.

03:07:48.791 --> 03:07:51.794 region:rollup2
AND VICE VERSA SORT OF A WARM

03:07:50.459 --> 03:07:53.729 region:rollup2
HAND OFF BETWEEN.

03:07:51.794 --> 03:07:55.865 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN THAT PEOPLE UNCOVER

03:07:53.729 --> 03:07:56.699 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LONGER ELIGIBLE THAT

03:07:55.865 --> 03:07:57.900 region:rollup2
COVER CALIFORNIA SHARING

03:07:56.699 --> 03:08:00.236 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WITH THE STATE TO

03:07:57.900 --> 03:08:01.771 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S. THERE'S.

03:08:00.236 --> 03:08:02.271 region:rollup2
THEN SOMEHOW REACHED ON TED TO

03:08:01.771 --> 03:08:04.640 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

03:08:02.271 --> 03:08:05.674 region:rollup2
.

03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:07.443 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MORE CONSISTENCY AND

03:08:05.674 --> 03:08:07.810 region:rollup2
PROVIDER NETWORKS WOULD PUT

03:08:07.443 --> 03:08:09.779 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HELP.

03:08:07.810 --> 03:08:11.647 region:rollup2
.

03:08:09.779 --> 03:08:12.982 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ISSUE.

03:08:11.647 --> 03:08:14.483 region:rollup2
EARLIER IN TERMS OF THERE'S A

03:08:12.982 --> 03:08:16.452 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF COMPLEXITIES ABOUT WHY

03:08:14.483 --> 03:08:18.487 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T HAPPEN.

03:08:16.452 --> 03:08:19.455 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY PAYMENT RATES ARE ARE

03:08:18.487 --> 03:08:21.223 region:rollup2
ARE ONE OF THEM.

03:08:19.455 --> 03:08:21.390 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHERS

03:08:21.223 --> 03:08:23.859 region:rollup2
SO.

03:08:21.390 --> 03:08:24.894 region:rollup2
.

03:08:23.859 --> 03:08:27.730 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT I'M NOT MUCH I HAVE

03:08:24.894 --> 03:08:29.098 region:rollup2
OTHER IDEAS TO OFFER.

03:08:27.730 --> 03:08:30.933 region:rollup2
THEM MENTIONED AT THE END OF MY

03:08:29.098 --> 03:08:31.567 region:rollup2
TALK ONE OPTION AVAILABLE TO THE

03:08:30.933 --> 03:08:33.269 region:rollup2
STATE TO US.

03:08:31.567 --> 03:08:35.104 region:rollup2
WEAVER.

03:08:33.269 --> 03:08:36.639 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE TO IMPOSE TWELVE

03:08:35.104 --> 03:08:38.641 region:rollup2
MONTH CONTINUES ELIGIBILITY.

03:08:36.639 --> 03:08:39.441 region:rollup2
OR A FOR MEDI CAL ADULTS YOU

03:08:38.641 --> 03:08:40.342 region:rollup2
HAVE IN PLACE FOR CHILDREN

03:08:39.441 --> 03:08:41.944 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

03:08:40.342 --> 03:08:42.545 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION

03:08:41.944 --> 03:08:43.579 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE AMENDING YOUR

03:08:42.545 --> 03:08:45.481 region:rollup2
STATE WAIVER.

03:08:43.579 --> 03:08:47.049 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT COMES UP IS.

03:08:45.481 --> 03:08:49.118 region:rollup2
.

03:08:47.049 --> 03:08:50.586 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT.

03:08:49.118 --> 03:08:51.820 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT ARE

PART OF THEIR SERVICE LINES.

03:08:58.761 --> 03:09:02.131 region:rollup2
AND EVEN IF THEY ARE OFFERING

03:09:00.529 --> 03:09:03.732 region:rollup2
BOTH THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE

03:09:02.131 --> 03:09:05.634 region:rollup2
OFFERING BOTH IN A PARTICULAR

03:09:03.732 --> 03:09:06.669 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC AREA. SO THERE ARE

03:09:05.634 --> 03:09:07.770 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT SOME STATES HAVE

03:09:06.669 --> 03:09:09.805 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S

03:09:07.770 --> 03:09:11.373 region:rollup2
FAVORABLE CONTRACTING TERMS FOR

MANAGED CARE MEDICAID MANAGED

03:09:14.410 --> 03:09:17.213 region:rollup2
CARE POPULATION SO THERE ARE

03:09:16.645 --> 03:09:18.881 region:rollup2
SOME AVENUES YOU CAN GO DOWN

03:09:17.213 --> 03:09:20.316 region:rollup2
THERE AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT.

03:09:18.881 --> 03:09:21.951 region:rollup2

03:09:20.316 --> 03:09:23.986 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL TURNING OUT OF ONE

03:09:21.951 --> 03:09:26.255 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND THE OTHER COULD HAVE

03:09:23.986 --> 03:09:28.057 region:rollup2
A SOFT LANDING SPOTS IN A PLAN

WHAT SPECIFICALLY COULD WE DO OR

03:14:20.315 --> 03:14:23.719 region:rollup2
MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:14:22.451 --> 03:14:26.155 region:rollup2
PROVIDER DIRECTORS WE HAD ARE

03:14:23.719 --> 03:14:27.589 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ADEQUATE?

03:14:26.155 --> 03:14:28.991 region:rollup2
WELL I SHOULD I SHOULD SAY.

03:14:27.589 --> 03:14:31.393 region:rollup2
THE IMPACTS OF TURN ON

03:14:28.991 --> 03:14:32.794 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION REALLY GO BOTH WAYS.

03:14:31.393 --> 03:14:34.830 region:rollup2
THAT THAT INCREASING UTILIZATION

03:14:32.794 --> 03:14:36.098 region:rollup2
IS ONCE THEY GET BACK ON A PLAN.

03:14:34.830 --> 03:14:38.033 region:rollup2
BUT THEN THERE'S OF COURSE THE

03:14:36.098 --> 03:14:39.334 region:rollup2
DROP OFF IN UTILIZATION THAT

03:14:38.033 --> 03:14:40.903 region:rollup2
OCCURS AS WE SAW WITH THE SELF

03:14:39.334 --> 03:14:42.604 region:rollup2
REPORTED THIRTY FOUR PERCENT

03:14:40.903 --> 03:14:44.173 region:rollup2
DROPPING A MEDICATION. THAT

03:14:42.604 --> 03:14:46.408 region:rollup2
HAPPENS SAY IF THEY TRANSITION

03:14:44.173 --> 03:14:47.709 region:rollup2
AWFUL PLAN INTO SOME PERIOD OF

03:14:46.408 --> 03:14:48.911 region:rollup2
BEING ON IT SHORT SO I I WOULD I

03:14:47.709 --> 03:14:50.212 region:rollup2
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT GOES

03:14:48.911 --> 03:14:51.346 region:rollup2
BOTH WAYS.

03:14:50.212 --> 03:14:52.714 region:rollup2
BUT IT FROM A HEALTH SYSTEM

03:14:51.346 --> 03:14:53.982 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE YOU WE SEE THAT

03:14:52.714 --> 03:14:55.450 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION INCREASE.

03:14:53.982 --> 03:14:57.185 region:rollup2
WHICH IN TURN WOULD INCREASE

03:14:55.450 --> 03:14:58.353 region:rollup2
THE PLAN COSTS AND PREMIUMS AND

03:14:57.185 --> 03:14:59.888 region:rollup2
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

03:14:58.353 --> 03:15:01.557 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF STRATEGIES FOR

03:14:59.888 --> 03:15:02.524 region:rollup2
ENSURING UP TODAY PROVIDER

03:15:01.557 --> 03:15:04.092 region:rollup2
NETWORKS.

03:15:02.524 --> 03:15:06.628 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

03:15:04.092 --> 03:15:07.996 region:rollup2
DID GO DOWN THE ROAD OF OF

03:15:06.628 --> 03:15:09.731 region:rollup2
PENALIZING PLANS.

03:15:07.996 --> 03:15:11.066 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF

03:15:09.731 --> 03:15:12.601 region:rollup2
ENSURING.

03:15:11.066 --> 03:15:13.635 region:rollup2
PROVIDER NETWORK ADEQUACY

03:15:12.601 --> 03:15:15.003 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

03:15:13.635 --> 03:15:17.506 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE THERE STEEP

03:15:15.003 --> 03:15:19.107 region:rollup2
PENALTIES IMPOSED ON INSURERS.

03:15:17.506 --> 03:15:20.742 region:rollup2
THERE'S AUDITS.

03:15:19.107 --> 03:15:22.578 region:rollup2
SECRET SHOPPER STUDIES ANY

03:15:20.742 --> 03:15:23.612 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF AVENUES THAT THAT YOU

03:15:22.578 --> 03:15:25.814 region:rollup2
COULD GO DOWN.

03:15:23.612 --> 03:15:27.316 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE

03:15:25.814 --> 03:15:28.717 region:rollup2
ROLE OF REGULATION A PROVIDER

03:15:27.316 --> 03:15:30.652 region:rollup2
NETWORKS HAS LARGELY BEEN

03:15:28.717 --> 03:15:32.387 region:rollup2
REACTIVE I IN MANY STATES THAT

03:15:30.652 --> 03:15:34.489 region:rollup2
IS A REACTIVE TO SPECIFIC

03:15:32.387 --> 03:15:36.925 region:rollup2
CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NOT

03:15:34.489 --> 03:15:38.493 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE. ARE TO TO

03:15:36.925 --> 03:15:39.494 region:rollup2
FIND A PROVIDER AS OPPOSED TO.

03:15:38.493 --> 03:15:41.330 region:rollup2
OF A MORE.

03:15:39.494 --> 03:15:43.632 region:rollup2
.

03:15:41.330 --> 03:15:45.434 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT STRATEGY OF EITHER

03:15:43.632 --> 03:15:49.171 region:rollup2
FINING OR.

03:15:45.434 --> 03:15:49.605 region:rollup2

HIGH PRICES.

LIKE LAST

03:17:10.419 --> 03:17:12.988 region:rollup2

THANK YOU.

03:17:12.988 --> 03:17:16.124 region:rollup2
FIRST I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE

03:17:14.289 --> 03:17:18.060 region:rollup2
AARON TRASH THE ASSOCIATE

GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:17:25.233 --> 03:17:27.903 region:rollup2
THINK YOU TO THE CHAIRS INTO

03:17:26.601 --> 03:17:29.438 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE AND TO THE STAFF

03:17:27.903 --> 03:17:30.872 region:rollup2
FOR HOSTING THIS MEETING AND FOR

03:17:29.438 --> 03:17:32.274 region:rollup2
INVITING ME TO GIVE SOME REMARKS

03:17:30.872 --> 03:17:33.608 region:rollup2
HERE TODAY.

03:17:32.274 --> 03:17:35.110 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THOSE

03:17:33.608 --> 03:17:36.078 region:rollup2
PRYOR'S OF PANEL IMPAIR SPEAKERS

03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:37.412 region:rollup2
ABOUT FRAGMENTATION IN OUR

03:17:36.078 --> 03:17:39.047 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

03:17:37.412 --> 03:17:39.981 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF KIND OF SOURCES OF

03:17:39.047 --> 03:17:41.350 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND

03:17:39.981 --> 03:17:42.851 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE

03:17:41.350 --> 03:17:44.519 region:rollup2
BIT AND THINK ABOUT. THAT

03:17:42.851 --> 03:17:45.821 region:rollup2
FRAGMENTATION AND ITS IMPACT ON

03:17:44.519 --> 03:17:46.888 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN THE

03:17:45.821 --> 03:17:48.056 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT OUR PROVIDERS ARE

03:17:46.888 --> 03:17:49.691 region:rollup2
TREATING PATIENTS WHO ARE

03:17:48.056 --> 03:17:51.693 region:rollup2
COVERED BY DIFFERENT SOURCES OF

03:17:49.691 --> 03:17:52.728 region:rollup2
COVERAGE. AND GETTING PAID VERY

03:17:51.693 --> 03:17:54.763 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT RATES.

03:17:52.728 --> 03:17:56.631 region:rollup2
IN DOING SO.

03:17:54.763 --> 03:17:58.133 region:rollup2
AND SO THE KIND OF EMPHASIS

03:17:56.631 --> 03:17:59.201 region:rollup2
TODAY IS IN THINKING ABOUT YOU

03:17:58.133 --> 03:18:00.469 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

03:17:59.201 --> 03:18:02.704 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS HOW ARE THEY GETTING

03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:03.638 region:rollup2
PAID HOW TO THESE PRICES VARY.

03:18:02.704 --> 03:18:04.706 region:rollup2
AND WHAT MIGHT IT MEAN IF WE

03:18:03.638 --> 03:18:06.374 region:rollup2
START TO THINK ABOUT APPROACHES

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:08.110 region:rollup2
TOWARD A MORE UNIFORM RATE

03:18:06.374 --> 03:18:10.278 region:rollup2
SETTING STRUCTURE ACROSS

03:18:08.110 --> 03:18:11.079 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PAYERS IN THE STATE.

03:18:10.278 --> 03:18:12.247 region:rollup2
THINK I'LL JUST START UP BY

03:18:11.079 --> 03:18:13.815 region:rollup2
SETTING A QUICK DEFINITION WHEN

03:18:12.247 --> 03:18:15.083 region:rollup2
I TALK ABOUT PAYMENT RATES ARE

03:18:13.815 --> 03:18:16.451 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT TO PROVIDERS WHAT

03:18:15.083 --> 03:18:18.320 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THE TOTAL

03:18:16.451 --> 03:18:18.920 region:rollup2
ACTUAL DOLLARS THAT ARE P. TO

03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:20.922 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDER FOR TREATING A

03:18:18.920 --> 03:18:22.257 region:rollup2
PATIENT. AND THOSE DOLLARS COULD

03:18:20.922 --> 03:18:23.992 region:rollup2
BE PAID BY SOME COMBINATION

03:18:22.257 --> 03:18:25.594 region:rollup2
PERHAPS OF THE HEALTH PLAN AND

03:18:23.992 --> 03:18:26.528 region:rollup2
SOME PATIENT OUT OF POCKET COST

03:18:25.594 --> 03:18:27.696 region:rollup2
SHARING IN THE FORM OF A

03:18:26.528 --> 03:18:29.531 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLES OR CO INSURANCE THE

03:18:27.696 --> 03:18:30.031 region:rollup2
KIND OF THAT. THE TOTAL ACTUAL

03:18:29.531 --> 03:18:31.333 region:rollup2
PRICE THAT THE PROVIDER

03:18:30.031 --> 03:18:32.467 region:rollup2
RECEIVES.

03:18:31.333 --> 03:18:35.270 region:rollup2
AYE AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR

03:18:32.467 --> 03:18:36.338 region:rollup2
TREATING THESE PATIENTS.

03:18:35.270 --> 03:18:37.639 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE KIND OF

03:18:36.338 --> 03:18:39.207 region:rollup2
THREE MAJOR SOURCES OF HEALTH

03:18:37.639 --> 03:18:40.709 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COVERAGE ON IN

03:18:39.207 --> 03:18:42.010 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ACROSS THE

03:18:40.709 --> 03:18:43.245 region:rollup2
COUNTRY THE MEDICARE PROGRAM

03:18:42.010 --> 03:18:44.846 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS ARE

03:18:43.245 --> 03:18:46.915 region:rollup2
PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. AND ALSO

03:18:44.846 --> 03:18:47.849 region:rollup2
THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.

03:18:46.915 --> 03:18:48.683 region:rollup2
AND BEFORE GETTING INTO THE KIND

03:18:47.849 --> 03:18:50.585 region:rollup2
OF VERY DIFFERENT.

03:18:48.683 --> 03:18:51.586 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF PAYMENT RATES THAT

03:18:50.585 --> 03:18:52.654 region:rollup2
THESE DIFFERENT PROVIDERS PAY

03:18:51.586 --> 03:18:54.222 region:rollup2
HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

03:18:52.654 --> 03:18:54.856 region:rollup2
THAT JUST ALSO SET THE STAGE A

03:18:54.222 --> 03:18:57.659 region:rollup2
IN IN.

03:18:54.856 --> 03:18:58.960 region:rollup2
EXPLAINING THAT THE THEY ARRIVE

03:18:57.659 --> 03:19:00.529 region:rollup2
AT THESE RATES IN VERY DIFFERENT

03:18:58.960 --> 03:19:01.363 region:rollup2
WAYS AS WELL.

03:19:00.529 --> 03:19:02.564 region:rollup2
AND SO IN THE CASE OF THE

03:19:01.363 --> 03:19:04.266 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PROGRAM THE FEDERAL

03:19:02.564 --> 03:19:06.001 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVELY SETS

03:19:04.266 --> 03:19:07.369 region:rollup2
PAYMENT RATES AND BASICALLY SAYS

03:19:06.001 --> 03:19:08.670 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT WE PAY HOSPITALS AND

03:19:07.369 --> 03:19:10.872 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS FOR TREATING MEDICARE

03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:13.108 region:rollup2
PATIENTS. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

03:19:10.872 --> 03:19:14.843 region:rollup2
MOST PROVIDERS CHOOSE TO TAKE IT

03:19:13.108 --> 03:19:16.645 region:rollup2
INTO TREAT MEDICARE PATIENTS AND

03:19:14.843 --> 03:19:18.246 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THOSE PAYMENT RATES.

03:19:16.645 --> 03:19:19.381 region:rollup2
BUT ULTIMATELY THERE'S REALLY

03:19:18.246 --> 03:19:20.749 region:rollup2
NO BACK AND FORTH IN IN THIS

03:19:19.381 --> 03:19:22.984 region:rollup2
IT'S A IT'S A LEVEL THAT SET BY

03:19:20.749 --> 03:19:24.486 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

03:19:22.984 --> 03:19:25.654 region:rollup2
IN VERY STRONG CONTRAST TO THAT

03:19:24.486 --> 03:19:26.822 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE COMMERCIAL MARKET

03:19:25.654 --> 03:19:28.423 region:rollup2
WHERE PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS

03:19:26.822 --> 03:19:29.825 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH

03:19:28.423 --> 03:19:31.293 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS LIKE HOSPITALS AND

03:19:29.825 --> 03:19:33.195 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS. AND ESSENTIALLY

03:19:31.293 --> 03:19:34.729 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF

03:19:33.195 --> 03:19:35.831 region:rollup2
PAYMENT GOING TO BE. AND

03:19:34.729 --> 03:19:37.199 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THESE PAYMENT RATES

03:19:35.831 --> 03:19:38.700 region:rollup2
REFLECT THAT THE KIND OF

03:19:37.199 --> 03:19:40.368 region:rollup2
RELATIVE BARGAINING LEVERAGE

03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:42.470 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PROVIDERS IN BETWEEN

03:19:40.368 --> 03:19:44.272 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS IN THE AREA. AND

03:19:42.470 --> 03:19:45.674 region:rollup2
TEND TO VARY CONSIDERABLY I'M

03:19:44.272 --> 03:19:46.241 region:rollup2
ACROSS DIFFERENT PROVIDERS IN

03:19:45.674 --> 03:19:47.642 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL HEALTH

03:19:46.241 --> 03:19:48.844 region:rollup2
PLANS.

03:19:47.642 --> 03:19:49.744 region:rollup2
FINALLY IN THE CASE OF THE

03:19:48.844 --> 03:19:50.979 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAM IT'S UP TO

03:19:49.744 --> 03:19:52.781 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENTS TAKEN TO

03:19:50.979 --> 03:19:53.849 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF

03:19:52.781 --> 03:19:54.783 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN THEIR

03:19:53.849 --> 03:19:56.318 region:rollup2
MEDI IN THEIR RESPECTIVE

03:19:54.783 --> 03:19:57.519 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAMS.

03:19:56.318 --> 03:19:58.854 region:rollup2
AND IN THE CASE OF CALIFORNIA

03:19:57.519 --> 03:20:00.355 region:rollup2
THE MEDICARE PART MEDI CAL

03:19:58.854 --> 03:20:01.857 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THE STATE GOVERNMENT

03:20:00.355 --> 03:20:03.525 region:rollup2
SETS UP PAYMENT RATES FOR

03:20:01.857 --> 03:20:06.328 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS. AND NEGOTIATE

03:20:03.525 --> 03:20:07.529 region:rollup2
PAYMENT RATES WITH HOSPITALS.

03:20:06.328 --> 03:20:08.730 region:rollup2
SO WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE IN

03:20:07.529 --> 03:20:10.799 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT A PROVIDER

03:20:08.730 --> 03:20:12.000 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GETS PAID FOR TREATING

03:20:10.799 --> 03:20:13.034 region:rollup2
A PATIENT THAT'S COVERED ONE OF

03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:13.668 region:rollup2
BY WHAT BY ONE OF THESE

03:20:13.034 --> 03:20:15.770 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INSURANCE

03:20:13.668 --> 03:20:17.339 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

03:20:15.770 --> 03:20:18.607 region:rollup2
SO FIRST I'M GONNA FOCUS ON

03:20:17.339 --> 03:20:19.875 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS FOR THE FOR THE FIRST

03:20:18.607 --> 03:20:21.343 region:rollup2
YOU SLICE AND THEN WILL SWITCH

03:20:19.875 --> 03:20:22.577 region:rollup2
TRANSITION TO PHYSICIANS.

03:20:21.343 --> 03:20:23.979 region:rollup2
BUT THIS CHARTER SHOWING YOU

03:20:22.577 --> 03:20:25.647 region:rollup2
THAT AVERAGE PAYMENT THAT A

03:20:23.979 --> 03:20:27.082 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL RUSHED RECEIVES FOR

03:20:25.647 --> 03:20:28.817 region:rollup2
TREATING AN IN PATIENT.

03:20:27.082 --> 03:20:30.519 region:rollup2
FOR TREATING A PATIENT AS AN IN

03:20:28.817 --> 03:20:32.487 region:rollup2
PATIENT IN THE HOSPITAL

03:20:30.519 --> 03:20:33.021 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE SOURCE OF

03:20:32.487 --> 03:20:34.623 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COVERAGE OF THAT

03:20:33.021 --> 03:20:35.957 region:rollup2
PATIENT.

03:20:34.623 --> 03:20:37.392 region:rollup2
SO THE TOP LINE IS AN ORANGE

03:20:35.957 --> 03:20:39.261 region:rollup2
THIS IS PATIENTS COVERED BY

03:20:37.392 --> 03:20:41.129 region:rollup2
PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS. THE MIDDLE

03:20:39.261 --> 03:20:42.898 region:rollup2
LINE IN IN PURPLE IS A MEDICARE

03:20:41.129 --> 03:20:45.066 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND THE BOTTOM LINE AND

03:20:42.898 --> 03:20:46.368 region:rollup2
BLEW HIS MEDICAID PATIENTS.

03:20:45.066 --> 03:20:48.303 region:rollup2
AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT ON

03:20:46.368 --> 03:20:49.604 region:rollup2
AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY

03:20:48.303 --> 03:20:51.640 region:rollup2
PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS ARE PAYING

03:20:49.604 --> 03:20:52.674 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN

03:20:51.640 --> 03:20:54.209 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PAYS THOSE

03:20:52.674 --> 03:20:55.543 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS.

03:20:54.209 --> 03:20:57.345 region:rollup2
SO IN TWENTY TWELVE IT WAS ABOUT

03:20:55.543 --> 03:20:57.846 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OR ABOUT

03:20:57.345 --> 03:20:58.880 region:rollup2
THREE QUARTERS MORE FOR

03:20:57.846 --> 03:21:01.316 region:rollup2
TREATING.

03:20:58.880 --> 03:21:03.118 region:rollup2
PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS FOR

03:21:01.316 --> 03:21:04.419 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SERVICE AS

03:21:03.118 --> 03:21:06.454 region:rollup2
A MEDICARE MEDICAID PATIENTS IN

03:21:04.419 --> 03:21:07.455 region:rollup2
YOUR HOSPITAL.

03:21:06.454 --> 03:21:08.757 region:rollup2
ONE OTHER KIND OF IMPORTANT

03:21:07.455 --> 03:21:10.759 region:rollup2
TAKEAWAY POINT FROM THIS CHART

03:21:08.757 --> 03:21:12.761 region:rollup2
IS THAT THAT RELATIVE MARKUP FOR

03:21:10.759 --> 03:21:14.462 region:rollup2
THESE HIGHER RELATIVE PAYMENTS

03:21:12.761 --> 03:21:15.964 region:rollup2
FROM PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS.

03:21:14.462 --> 03:21:17.299 region:rollup2
HAVE INCREASED CONSIDERABLY OVER

03:21:15.964 --> 03:21:18.900 region:rollup2
TIME AND SO BACK IN THE EARLY

03:21:17.299 --> 03:21:20.368 region:rollup2
NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSANDS

03:21:18.900 --> 03:21:22.103 region:rollup2
PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS WERE PAYING

03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:23.772 region:rollup2
AND MODESTLY OR JUST A LITTLE

03:21:22.103 --> 03:21:25.073 region:rollup2
BIT MORE THAN MEDICARE. AND IN

03:21:23.772 --> 03:21:26.141 region:rollup2
MORE RECENT YEARS WERE AT THE

03:21:25.073 --> 03:21:27.709 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS

03:21:26.141 --> 03:21:29.311 region:rollup2
ARE PAYING CONSIDERABLY MORE

03:21:27.709 --> 03:21:31.646 region:rollup2
THAN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

03:21:29.311 --> 03:21:32.814 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE PAYING HOSPITALS.

03:21:31.646 --> 03:21:34.082 region:rollup2
NOW THESE ARE AVERAGE.

03:21:32.814 --> 03:21:35.884 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS WHICH.

03:21:34.082 --> 03:21:37.118 region:rollup2
KIND OF MASK AS YOU'VE HEARD IN

03:21:35.884 --> 03:21:37.586 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT INSTANCES TODAY

03:21:37.118 --> 03:21:39.988 region:rollup2
THAT MASK CONSIDERABLE

03:21:37.586 --> 03:21:41.256 region:rollup2
VARIATION.

03:21:39.988 --> 03:21:42.591 region:rollup2
AS OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GOING TO

03:21:41.256 --> 03:21:43.825 region:rollup2
FOCUS A LOT ON VARIATION IN KIND

03:21:42.591 --> 03:21:45.293 region:rollup2
OF THE DRIVERS OF THIS BUT I

03:21:43.825 --> 03:21:46.995 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT

03:21:45.293 --> 03:21:48.830 region:rollup2
THERE'S ESSENTIALLY. HAD THIS

03:21:46.995 --> 03:21:50.565 region:rollup2
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD HOSPITAL

03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:51.833 region:rollup2
THAT'S RECEIVING.

03:21:50.565 --> 03:21:52.701 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE QUARTERS MORE FOR

03:21:51.833 --> 03:21:54.035 region:rollup2
TREATING A PRIVATELY INSURED

03:21:52.701 --> 03:21:55.770 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND TREATING A MEDICARE

03:21:54.035 --> 03:21:58.073 region:rollup2
PATIENT THERE'S A LOT OF

03:21:55.770 --> 03:21:59.741 region:rollup2
VARIATION AROUND. THAT KIND A

03:21:58.073 --> 03:22:01.309 region:rollup2
MIDDLE AVERAGE PAYMENT WHERE YOU

03:21:59.741 --> 03:22:02.277 region:rollup2
SEE SOME HOSPITALS GETTING PAID

03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:03.745 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE THAN THAT FOR

03:22:02.277 --> 03:22:05.113 region:rollup2
PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS AND

03:22:03.745 --> 03:22:06.348 region:rollup2
SOME HOSPITALS GETTING PAID MUCH

03:22:05.113 --> 03:22:08.249 region:rollup2
LESS THAN THAT FOR TREATING

03:22:06.348 --> 03:22:09.951 region:rollup2
PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS.

03:22:08.249 --> 03:22:11.319 region:rollup2
THESE KIND OF RELATIVE MARKUPS

03:22:09.951 --> 03:22:13.488 region:rollup2
OVER WHAT HOSPITALS GET PAID FOR

03:22:11.319 --> 03:22:14.789 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PATIENTS COMPARED TO

03:22:13.488 --> 03:22:16.324 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY GET PAID FOR TREATING

03:22:14.789 --> 03:22:18.526 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PATIENTS.

03:22:16.324 --> 03:22:20.028 region:rollup2
THOSE MARKUPS VERY IN MANY

03:22:18.526 --> 03:22:21.329 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS SO IN ONE WAY

03:22:20.028 --> 03:22:22.897 region:rollup2
THEY VARIAS ACROSS DIFFERENT

03:22:21.329 --> 03:22:25.333 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE FOR

03:22:22.897 --> 03:22:27.068 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE. A SIEMENS HOSPITAL

03:22:25.333 --> 03:22:29.137 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FOR PRIVATELY INSURED

03:22:27.068 --> 03:22:30.972 region:rollup2
PATIENTS TEND TO BE HIGHER IN

03:22:29.137 --> 03:22:32.640 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO MARKET THAN THEY

03:22:30.972 --> 03:22:34.743 region:rollup2
DO IN THE LOS ANGELES MARKET.

03:22:32.640 --> 03:22:36.378 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO VERY ACROSS HOSPITALS

03:22:34.743 --> 03:22:37.612 region:rollup2
WITH IN A MARKET SO THAT IS TO

03:22:36.378 --> 03:22:40.081 region:rollup2
SAY THAT YOU KNOW ONE HOSPITAL

03:22:37.612 --> 03:22:41.649 region:rollup2
IN LA IS GETTING PAID MORE THAN

03:22:40.081 --> 03:22:42.217 region:rollup2
ANOTHER HOSPITAL IN LA ON

03:22:41.649 --> 03:22:43.618 region:rollup2
AVERAGE FROM PRIVATE HEALTH

03:22:42.217 --> 03:22:44.919 region:rollup2
PLANS.

03:22:43.618 --> 03:22:46.454 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO VARIATION EVEN

03:22:44.919 --> 03:22:48.089 region:rollup2
WITHIN A HOSPITAL IN THE SENSE

03:22:46.454 --> 03:22:49.057 region:rollup2
THAT DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL PAYERS

03:22:48.089 --> 03:22:50.558 region:rollup2
PAY THAT HOSPITAL DIFFERENT

03:22:49.057 --> 03:22:52.761 region:rollup2
RATES SO THEY MAY HAVE

03:22:50.558 --> 03:22:54.095 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED A DIFFERENT RATE. FOR

03:22:52.761 --> 03:22:55.030 region:rollup2
THEIR ANTHEM PATIENTS THAN THEY

03:22:54.095 --> 03:22:56.731 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE FOR THEIR HEALTH NET

03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:59.234 region:rollup2
PATIENTS OR KIND OF ALL THESE

03:22:56.731 --> 03:23:00.602 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SOURCES OF VARIATION.

03:22:59.234 --> 03:23:02.270 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN AS I MENTIONED OTHER

03:23:00.602 --> 03:23:03.972 region:rollup2
NECK SPEAKER WILL KIND OF. DELVE

03:23:02.270 --> 03:23:05.407 region:rollup2
INTO THIS A BIT MORE AND AND THE

03:23:03.972 --> 03:23:06.608 region:rollup2
DRIVERS OF THIS VARIATION BUT

03:23:05.407 --> 03:23:08.143 region:rollup2
WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON FOR THE

03:23:06.608 --> 03:23:09.978 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF MY COMMENTS IS

03:23:08.143 --> 03:23:11.413 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THE NOTION THAT. WE

03:23:09.978 --> 03:23:13.081 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF VARIATION BOTH ON

03:23:11.413 --> 03:23:14.616 region:rollup2
THE PRIOR SLIDE ACROSS DIFFERENT

03:23:13.081 --> 03:23:16.351 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF COVERAGE AND ON THIS

03:23:14.616 --> 03:23:17.819 region:rollup2
SIDE ON THIS SLIDE ACROSS

03:23:16.351 --> 03:23:19.220 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SOURCES OF PRIVATE

03:23:17.819 --> 03:23:21.289 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.

03:23:19.220 --> 03:23:23.158 region:rollup2
AND IF WE THINK ABOUT MOVING

03:23:21.289 --> 03:23:24.592 region:rollup2
TOWARD A POLICY KIND OF

03:23:23.158 --> 03:23:26.761 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WHICH IS A MORE

03:23:24.592 --> 03:23:28.129 region:rollup2
UNIFORM OF RATE SETTING OR A

03:23:26.761 --> 03:23:29.130 region:rollup2
MORE UNIFORM PAYMENT STRUCTURE

03:23:28.129 --> 03:23:29.931 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO THIS WOULD BE

03:23:29.130 --> 03:23:32.233 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE A SINGLE PAYER

03:23:29.931 --> 03:23:33.935 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. OR EVEN SOMETHING LIKE

03:23:32.233 --> 03:23:35.336 region:rollup2
AN ALL PAYER RATE SETTING A TYPE

03:23:33.935 --> 03:23:36.504 region:rollup2
OF APPROACH.

03:23:35.336 --> 03:23:38.506 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT'S AKIN TO

03:23:36.504 --> 03:23:41.276 region:rollup2
YOU ON THESE CHARTS IS DRAWING A

03:23:38.506 --> 03:23:42.811 region:rollup2
ST HORIZONTAL LINE SOMEWHERE AND

03:23:41.276 --> 03:23:44.379 region:rollup2
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO PAY

03:23:42.811 --> 03:23:46.414 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AT THIS LEVEL.

03:23:44.379 --> 03:23:47.716 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS

03:23:46.414 --> 03:23:49.818 region:rollup2
OF THE KIND OF REACTION OR

03:23:47.716 --> 03:23:51.586 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF PROVIDERS IS GOING

03:23:49.818 --> 03:23:52.887 region:rollup2
TO VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING

03:23:51.586 --> 03:23:54.456 region:rollup2
ON WHERE THEY'RE STARTING FROM

03:23:52.887 --> 03:23:56.458 region:rollup2
BOTH IN THE MIX OF THE TYPES OF

03:23:54.456 --> 03:23:56.991 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THEY SEE. AND ALSO IN

03:23:56.458 --> 03:23:58.426 region:rollup2
THEIR RELATIVE COMMERCIAL

03:23:56.991 --> 03:23:59.894 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS.

03:23:58.426 --> 03:24:01.262 region:rollup2
SO ONE POINT IS THAT ESSENTIALLY

03:23:59.894 --> 03:24:02.664 region:rollup2
KIND OF MOVING TOWARD A MORE

03:24:01.262 --> 03:24:04.299 region:rollup2
UNIFORM RATE STRUCTURE IS GOING

03:24:02.664 --> 03:24:05.633 region:rollup2
TO CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS AND

03:24:04.299 --> 03:24:06.668 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW

03:24:05.633 --> 03:24:08.103 region:rollup2
CREATE ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGES

03:24:06.668 --> 03:24:09.170 region:rollup2
AND OPPORTUNITIES.

03:24:08.103 --> 03:24:10.905 region:rollup2
A SECOND POINT IS JUST

03:24:09.170 --> 03:24:12.941 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY WHERE DO YOU DRAW

03:24:10.905 --> 03:24:14.743 region:rollup2
THAT LINE AT WHAT LEVEL IS THE

03:24:12.941 --> 03:24:16.277 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF PAYMENT TO

03:24:14.743 --> 03:24:17.612 region:rollup2
BE PAID IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

03:24:16.277 --> 03:24:19.547 region:rollup2
TOWARD ONE SIDE OF RATES.

03:24:17.612 --> 03:24:20.648 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF STOCK IN

03:24:19.547 --> 03:24:22.684 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT AND SETTING THAT AT

03:24:20.648 --> 03:24:23.985 region:rollup2
AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL.

03:24:22.684 --> 03:24:25.453 region:rollup2
SETTING TOO HIGHLY OF SYSTEM

03:24:23.985 --> 03:24:26.521 region:rollup2
KIND OF FISCAL CONSTRAINTS AND

03:24:25.453 --> 03:24:27.889 region:rollup2
IN YOUR YOU KNOW IS THIS THE

03:24:26.521 --> 03:24:29.157 region:rollup2
RIGHT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:30.558 region:rollup2
AND ARE WE SPENDING TOO MUCH ON

03:24:29.157 --> 03:24:31.826 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE.

03:24:30.558 --> 03:24:33.228 region:rollup2
SETTING THAT RITA TO LOWER THE

03:24:31.826 --> 03:24:35.196 region:rollup2
LEVEL COULD LEAD TO CONCERNS

03:24:33.228 --> 03:24:37.132 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACCESS AND WORKFORCE KIND

03:24:35.196 --> 03:24:37.932 region:rollup2
OF FUTURE OUR INCENTIVES TO TO

03:24:37.132 --> 03:24:39.834 region:rollup2
ENTER INTO THE HEALTHCARE

03:24:37.932 --> 03:24:41.536 region:rollup2
PROFESSION AND THE QUALITY OF

03:24:39.834 --> 03:24:43.037 region:rollup2
CARE THAT'S DELIVERED.

03:24:41.536 --> 03:24:44.372 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE KIND OF POTENTIAL

03:24:43.037 --> 03:24:45.974 region:rollup2
STARTING POINT IN THINKING ABOUT

03:24:44.372 --> 03:24:47.242 region:rollup2
HOW YOU MIGHT SET THAT READ OR

03:24:45.974 --> 03:24:48.610 region:rollup2
HOW YOU MIGHT START THINKING

03:24:47.242 --> 03:24:50.311 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHERE USES AT THAT RATE IS

03:24:48.610 --> 03:24:52.113 region:rollup2
TO LOOK PERHAPS TO WHAT MEDICARE

03:24:50.311 --> 03:24:53.414 region:rollup2
PAYS HOSPITALS.

03:24:52.113 --> 03:24:55.550 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY MEDICARE'S VERY

03:24:53.414 --> 03:24:57.585 region:rollup2
LARGE PAYER OF HOSPITALS HAS A

03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:59.454 region:rollup2
VERY KIND A WELL KNOWN PUBLICLY

03:24:57.585 --> 03:25:01.322 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE RATE STRUCTURE THAT

03:24:59.454 --> 03:25:02.323 region:rollup2
THEY PAID TO HOSPITALS.

03:25:01.322 --> 03:25:03.358 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT YOU

03:25:02.323 --> 03:25:05.326 region:rollup2
KNOW AS A STARTING POINT IF WE

03:25:03.358 --> 03:25:06.794 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THE MEDICARE PAYMENT.

03:25:05.326 --> 03:25:08.429 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL PAYMENT MECHANISM

03:25:06.794 --> 03:25:09.764 region:rollup2
AS A STARTING POINT FOR FOR

03:25:08.429 --> 03:25:11.599 region:rollup2
REACHING THIS KIND OF UNIVERSAL

03:25:09.764 --> 03:25:12.367 region:rollup2
RATE STRUCTURE.

03:25:11.599 --> 03:25:14.602 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR

03:25:12.367 --> 03:25:14.903 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS ARE ESSENTIALLY OUR

03:25:14.602 --> 03:25:16.404 region:rollup2
MEDICARE'S?

03:25:14.903 --> 03:25:17.872 region:rollup2
PAYMENT RATES TO HOSPITAL

03:25:16.404 --> 03:25:19.841 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT IN TERMS OF COVERING

03:25:17.872 --> 03:25:21.576 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL'S COSTS.

03:25:19.841 --> 03:25:23.411 region:rollup2
SO IT TURNS OUT THAT ON AVERAGE

03:25:21.576 --> 03:25:24.612 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE ANSWER IS

03:25:23.411 --> 03:25:25.113 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THAT THEY'RE NOT

03:25:24.612 --> 03:25:28.016 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:25:25.113 --> 03:25:29.250 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE HOSPITALS LOSE MONEY

03:25:28.016 --> 03:25:30.552 region:rollup2
ON MEDICARE PATIENTS OUR HOW THE

03:25:29.250 --> 03:25:32.220 region:rollup2
OPERATING MARGIN IN TERMS OF

03:25:30.552 --> 03:25:33.888 region:rollup2
THEIR MEDICARE PATIENTS OF ABOUT

03:25:32.220 --> 03:25:35.790 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE SEVEN PERCENT.

03:25:33.888 --> 03:25:37.358 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE

03:25:35.790 --> 03:25:38.860 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS THAT THEY RECEIVE FOR

03:25:37.358 --> 03:25:40.328 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PATIENTS DO NOT COVER

03:25:38.860 --> 03:25:42.263 region:rollup2
THE COSTS THEY INCUR FOR

03:25:40.328 --> 03:25:44.499 region:rollup2
TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS ON

03:25:42.263 --> 03:25:46.601 region:rollup2
AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

03:25:44.499 --> 03:25:47.802 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THIS MASKS VARIATION

03:25:46.601 --> 03:25:49.938 region:rollup2
ACROSS DIFFERENT TYPES OF

03:25:47.802 --> 03:25:50.138 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AND SO IF YOU SEE IN

03:25:49.938 --> 03:25:52.507 region:rollup2
THIS.

03:25:50.138 --> 03:25:54.175 region:rollup2
THIS CHART BELOW THEIR THEIR

03:25:52.507 --> 03:25:55.844 region:rollup2
WE'VE KIND OF GROUP HOSPITALS OR

03:25:54.175 --> 03:25:57.645 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORS HAVE GROUP HOSPITALS

03:25:55.844 --> 03:25:58.079 region:rollup2
INTO THREE DIFFERENT POCKETS.

03:25:57.645 --> 03:26:00.248 region:rollup2
HEAD OF DEPENDING ON

03:25:58.079 --> 03:26:02.450 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY.

03:26:00.248 --> 03:26:04.485 region:rollup2
AT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY LOSE OR

03:26:02.450 --> 03:26:05.720 region:rollup2
DON'T LOSE ON MEDICARE PATIENTS

03:26:04.485 --> 03:26:07.088 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST THAT OF CALLED SO

03:26:05.720 --> 03:26:07.889 region:rollup2
THIS IS BROKEN UP BY THEN THE

03:26:07.088 --> 03:26:09.457 region:rollup2
PROFIT MARGIN ON MEDICARE

03:26:07.889 --> 03:26:11.092 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

03:26:09.457 --> 03:26:12.560 region:rollup2
THE FIRST US HEAD OF COLUMNS IS

03:26:11.092 --> 03:26:13.828 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY HOSPITALS THAT LOSE

03:26:12.560 --> 03:26:15.029 region:rollup2
A LOT OF MONEY TREATING MEDICARE

03:26:13.828 --> 03:26:18.066 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

03:26:15.029 --> 03:26:19.300 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE SET OF COLUMNS IS

03:26:18.066 --> 03:26:20.969 region:rollup2
PETER'S AYE HOSPITALS THAT LOSE

03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:22.170 region:rollup2
HIM MODERATE TELL TO SMALL

03:26:20.969 --> 03:26:23.404 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON TREATING

03:26:22.170 --> 03:26:24.806 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PATIENTS.

03:26:23.404 --> 03:26:26.574 region:rollup2
AND THE RIGHT MOST COLUMN IS

03:26:24.806 --> 03:26:27.842 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE

03:26:26.574 --> 03:26:29.077 region:rollup2
POSITIVE PROFIT MARGINS ON

03:26:27.842 --> 03:26:31.112 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PATIENTS OR MAKE MONEY

03:26:29.077 --> 03:26:32.614 region:rollup2
TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS.

03:26:31.112 --> 03:26:33.781 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THE POINTS HERE ARE

03:26:32.614 --> 03:26:35.683 region:rollup2
KIND OF ESSENTIALLY THAT THERE

03:26:33.781 --> 03:26:37.552 region:rollup2
ARE IN FACT SOME HOSPITALS THAT

03:26:35.683 --> 03:26:39.554 region:rollup2
HAVE POSITIVE PROFIT MARGINS AT

03:26:37.552 --> 03:26:40.822 region:rollup2
MEDICARE RATES.

03:26:39.554 --> 03:26:42.557 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND PULL BUT THERE

03:26:40.822 --> 03:26:43.391 region:rollup2
ARE MANY THAT DON'T AS WELL RATE

03:26:42.557 --> 03:26:44.792 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND.

03:26:43.391 --> 03:26:46.461 region:rollup2
KIND OF POINT IMPORTANT POINT

03:26:44.792 --> 03:26:48.663 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT. REALLY THIS

03:26:46.461 --> 03:26:51.266 region:rollup2
VARIATION STEMS FROM HOSPITAL

03:26:48.663 --> 03:26:51.799 region:rollup2
COSTS AND THE COST STRUCTURE.

03:26:51.266 --> 03:26:53.101 region:rollup2
THAT DIFFERS ACROSS THESE

03:26:51.799 --> 03:26:54.569 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS.

03:26:53.101 --> 03:26:55.737 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW

03:26:54.569 --> 03:26:57.238 region:rollup2
STARTING FROM A PLACE OF

03:26:55.737 --> 03:26:58.840 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYMENT RATES AND AND

03:26:57.238 --> 03:27:00.208 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT BE AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT

03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:01.943 region:rollup2
OF PAYMENT TO PAY HOSPITALS OR

03:27:00.208 --> 03:27:03.278 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE GO UP FROM THERE HOW

03:27:01.943 --> 03:27:04.545 region:rollup2
MUCH SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT GOING

03:27:03.278 --> 03:27:06.047 region:rollup2
UP FROM THERE.

03:27:04.545 --> 03:27:07.115 region:rollup2
ON THE ONE HAND ON AVERAGE

03:27:06.047 --> 03:27:09.350 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYMENTS ARE NOT

03:27:07.115 --> 03:27:10.718 region:rollup2
COVERING COSTS ON THE OTHER HAND

03:27:09.350 --> 03:27:12.287 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME HOSPITALS THAT

03:27:10.718 --> 03:27:13.821 region:rollup2
ARE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK AND

03:27:12.287 --> 03:27:15.556 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE AND AND

03:27:13.821 --> 03:27:17.125 region:rollup2
PERHAPS SOME SUGGESTION THAT.

03:27:15.556 --> 03:27:19.260 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE THAT HOSPITALS THAT

03:27:17.125 --> 03:27:20.795 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RESPOND TO STRONGER

03:27:19.260 --> 03:27:22.597 region:rollup2
FISCAL PRESSURE AND STRONGER

03:27:20.795 --> 03:27:24.165 region:rollup2
COST CONSTRAINTS ARE ABLE TO

03:27:22.597 --> 03:27:25.967 region:rollup2
OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND

03:27:24.165 --> 03:27:27.201 region:rollup2
REDUCE THEIR COST STRUCTURE. AND

03:27:25.967 --> 03:27:29.570 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MAY GET SOME OF THOSE

03:27:27.201 --> 03:27:30.939 region:rollup2
BENEFITS BUT THIS IS THAT AT A

03:27:29.570 --> 03:27:32.140 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TOUGH BALANCING POINT

03:27:30.939 --> 03:27:33.875 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SETTING A RATE TOO HIGH

03:27:32.140 --> 03:27:34.409 region:rollup2
AND SETTING A RE TO LOW AND

03:27:33.875 --> 03:27:36.311 region:rollup2
THEIR IMPLICATIONS ON BOTH

03:27:34.409 --> 03:27:37.378 region:rollup2
SIDES.

03:27:36.311 --> 03:27:39.047 region:rollup2
OF OUT WHERE YOU DIED OUT ON

03:27:37.378 --> 03:27:40.615 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:27:39.047 --> 03:27:41.616 region:rollup2
ONE OTHER IMPORTANT POINT FOR

03:27:40.615 --> 03:27:43.718 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT KIND OF.

03:27:41.616 --> 03:27:45.186 region:rollup2
CONVERGING TOO A STANDARDIZED

03:27:43.718 --> 03:27:47.121 region:rollup2
PAYMENT APPROACH IS NOT JUST THE

03:27:45.186 --> 03:27:48.756 region:rollup2
THE RATE OR THE LEVEL THAT YOU

03:27:47.121 --> 03:27:50.725 region:rollup2
MIGHT SET THESE PAYMENTS. BUT

03:27:48.756 --> 03:27:52.226 region:rollup2
ALSO THE MECHANISM FOR HOW YOU

03:27:50.725 --> 03:27:53.828 region:rollup2
KIND OF DESIGN THESE PAYMENTS TO

03:27:52.226 --> 03:27:55.530 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS.

03:27:53.828 --> 03:27:57.532 region:rollup2
SO IT TURNS OUT THAT NOT ONLY DO

03:27:55.530 --> 03:27:59.701 region:rollup2
THE LEVELS OF PAYMENT VARY

03:27:57.532 --> 03:28:01.970 region:rollup2
ACROSS MEDICARE MEDICAID AND

03:27:59.701 --> 03:28:04.272 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL INSURERS. BUT ALSO

03:28:01.970 --> 03:28:05.907 region:rollup2
HOW THEY ACTUALLY THE METHOD OR

03:28:04.272 --> 03:28:07.542 region:rollup2
HOW THEY ACTUALLY A KIND OF

03:28:05.907 --> 03:28:08.977 region:rollup2
DESIGN THESE PAYMENTS AND THE

03:28:07.542 --> 03:28:10.511 region:rollup2
METRIC FOR THOSE PAYMENTS ALSO

03:28:08.977 --> 03:28:11.579 region:rollup2
VERY ACROSS PAYERS.

03:28:10.511 --> 03:28:12.980 region:rollup2
SO IN THE CASE OF THE MEDICARE

03:28:11.579 --> 03:28:14.482 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:16.017 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYS HOSPITALS USING

03:28:14.482 --> 03:28:17.552 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED DIAGNOSIS

03:28:16.017 --> 03:28:19.120 region:rollup2
RELATED GROUPS ARE DRG USE WHICH

03:28:17.552 --> 03:28:21.522 region:rollup2
IS ESSENTIALLY A FIXED.

03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:22.857 region:rollup2
PAYMENT FOR A GIVEN CONDITION

03:28:21.522 --> 03:28:23.624 region:rollup2
AND SO IF YOU'RE PATIENT THAT

03:28:22.857 --> 03:28:25.093 region:rollup2
SHOWS UP WITH A JOINT

03:28:23.624 --> 03:28:26.427 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT IT DOESN'T REALLY

03:28:25.093 --> 03:28:27.729 region:rollup2
MATTER WHETHER YOU SEE IN OURS

03:28:26.427 --> 03:28:29.230 region:rollup2
TEN TIMES A DAY OR FIVE TIMES A

03:28:27.729 --> 03:28:31.265 region:rollup2
DAY OR IF YOU STAY FOR DAYS OR

03:28:29.230 --> 03:28:32.800 region:rollup2
THREE DAYS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT

03:28:31.265 --> 03:28:34.202 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE THE SAME FOR THAT

03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:35.570 region:rollup2
FIX CONDITION THERE SOME MINOR

03:28:34.202 --> 03:28:36.604 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS FOR HELL OTHER KIND

03:28:35.570 --> 03:28:37.105 region:rollup2
HEALTH CONDITIONS IN THOSE TYPES

03:28:36.604 --> 03:28:38.106 region:rollup2
OF THINGS BUT GENERALLY

03:28:37.105 --> 03:28:39.507 region:rollup2
SPEAKING.

03:28:38.106 --> 03:28:40.575 region:rollup2
FIXED PAYMENT FOR CAN PER

03:28:39.507 --> 03:28:41.943 region:rollup2
CONDITION.

03:28:40.575 --> 03:28:44.045 region:rollup2
NOW IN CONTRAST TO THAT MANY

03:28:41.943 --> 03:28:46.114 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PAYERS IN CALIFORNIA

03:28:44.045 --> 03:28:47.315 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY USE A PER DIEM BASED

03:28:46.114 --> 03:28:49.050 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE FOR

03:28:47.315 --> 03:28:50.051 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS. AND SO THAT MEANS

03:28:49.050 --> 03:28:52.086 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'VE ESSENTIALLY

03:28:50.051 --> 03:28:53.154 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED A PER DAY READ THAT

03:28:52.086 --> 03:28:54.355 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT STAYS IN THE

03:28:53.154 --> 03:28:55.590 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL.

03:28:54.355 --> 03:28:56.424 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF THE MEDI CAL

03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:58.726 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THERE WAS A RECENT

03:28:56.424 --> 03:29:00.194 region:rollup2
POLICY CHANGE WHERE OUR STATE

03:28:58.726 --> 03:29:02.697 region:rollup2
MOVED FROM PER DIEM BASED

03:29:00.194 --> 03:29:03.865 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS TO DRG BASED PAYMENTS.

03:29:02.697 --> 03:29:05.299 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY'RE KIND OF.

03:29:03.865 --> 03:29:06.367 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES TO

03:29:05.299 --> 03:29:07.835 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS OF PAYING

03:29:06.367 --> 03:29:09.237 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF

03:29:07.835 --> 03:29:11.272 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES BUT THE OVERARCHING

03:29:09.237 --> 03:29:12.840 region:rollup2
POINT IS THAT NOT EVERYONE'S

03:29:11.272 --> 03:29:13.908 region:rollup2
DOING THIS THE SAME WAY AND AS

03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:15.476 region:rollup2
YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF

03:29:13.908 --> 03:29:17.145 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND AND ALSO

03:29:15.476 --> 03:29:18.646 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY OPPORTUNITIES. OF

03:29:17.145 --> 03:29:20.415 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARD A UNIFORM.

03:29:18.646 --> 03:29:21.282 region:rollup2
TYPE OF PAYMENT.

03:29:20.415 --> 03:29:22.283 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

03:29:21.282 --> 03:29:23.418 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL BUT YOU'RE ALSO

03:29:22.283 --> 03:29:24.852 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE MECHANISM

03:29:23.418 --> 03:29:27.855 region:rollup2
FIRST FOR HOW YOU ENGAGE IN

03:29:24.852 --> 03:29:29.924 region:rollup2
PAYING PROVIDERS.

03:29:27.855 --> 03:29:30.091 region:rollup2
ONE FINAL COMMENT ON A IN TERMS

03:29:29.924 --> 03:29:30.892 region:rollup2
OF.

03:29:30.091 --> 03:29:32.593 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL REIMBURSEMENT IN

03:29:30.892 --> 03:29:33.961 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

03:29:32.593 --> 03:29:35.430 region:rollup2
IS OUT LOOKING OUT RELATIVE

03:29:33.961 --> 03:29:37.398 region:rollup2
PAYMENT LEVELS FROM THE MEDICARE

03:29:35.430 --> 03:29:38.066 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO HOSPITALS.

03:29:37.398 --> 03:29:39.801 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU MEMBER FROM THE FIRST

03:29:38.066 --> 03:29:41.369 region:rollup2
SLIDE ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE

03:29:39.801 --> 03:29:44.038 region:rollup2
COUNTRY MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO

03:29:41.369 --> 03:29:45.006 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS ARE JUST BELOW WERE A

03:29:44.038 --> 03:29:46.407 region:rollup2
PRETTY SIMILAR TíNH TED

03:29:45.006 --> 03:29:47.842 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS

03:29:46.407 --> 03:29:50.044 region:rollup2
JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW.

03:29:47.842 --> 03:29:51.045 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS BUT AGAIN YOU MAY

03:29:50.044 --> 03:29:52.914 region:rollup2
BE PICKING UP ON THE THEME THAT

03:29:51.045 --> 03:29:54.849 region:rollup2
MASKS A LOT OF VARIATION ACROSS

03:29:52.914 --> 03:29:56.484 region:rollup2
STATES IN TERMS OF HOW STATE SET

03:29:54.849 --> 03:29:58.386 region:rollup2
THEIR THEIR HOSPITAL PAYMENTS

03:29:56.484 --> 03:29:58.920 region:rollup2
FOR THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.

03:29:58.386 --> 03:30:00.688 region:rollup2
SO THIS.

03:29:58.920 --> 03:30:02.023 region:rollup2
DASHED LINE IN THE MIDDLE IS

03:30:00.688 --> 03:30:03.791 region:rollup2
THAT ONE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY

03:30:02.023 --> 03:30:05.893 region:rollup2
THE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

03:30:03.791 --> 03:30:07.795 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS FOR

03:30:05.893 --> 03:30:09.163 region:rollup2
TREATING MEDICAID PATIENTS. AND

03:30:07.795 --> 03:30:10.465 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU SEE IS THA CALIFORNIA

03:30:09.163 --> 03:30:11.833 region:rollup2
FALLS VERY MUCH IN THE MIDDLE OF

03:30:10.465 --> 03:30:13.501 region:rollup2
THE BALLPARK HERE IN THE SENSE

03:30:11.833 --> 03:30:14.068 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO THE

03:30:13.501 --> 03:30:15.436 region:rollup2
NATIONAL AVERAGE IN TERMS OF

03:30:14.068 --> 03:30:18.339 region:rollup2
OUR.

03:30:15.436 --> 03:30:20.374 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL PAYMENTS TO HOSPITAL.

03:30:18.339 --> 03:30:21.642 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO KIND OF SUMMARIZE

03:30:20.374 --> 03:30:22.944 region:rollup2
WHAT I'VE REVIEWED ON HOSPITALS

03:30:21.642 --> 03:30:24.946 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THAT THE TAKEAWAY

03:30:22.944 --> 03:30:26.581 region:rollup2
POINT IS THAT PRIVATE INSURERS

03:30:24.946 --> 03:30:28.649 region:rollup2
TEND TO PAY MUCH MORE. THAN

03:30:26.581 --> 03:30:30.284 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS

03:30:28.649 --> 03:30:32.453 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF OF PAYMENTS TO

03:30:30.284 --> 03:30:32.987 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS FOR TREATING PATIENTS

03:30:32.453 --> 03:30:34.021 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WITH THE SAME

03:30:32.987 --> 03:30:35.456 region:rollup2
CONDITION.

03:30:34.021 --> 03:30:36.791 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU MOVING TOWARD MORE

03:30:35.456 --> 03:30:38.326 region:rollup2
OF A UNIFORM RATE STRUCTURE

03:30:36.791 --> 03:30:39.927 region:rollup2
WOULD CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS

03:30:38.326 --> 03:30:42.230 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU SET THAT

03:30:39.927 --> 03:30:44.198 region:rollup2
LEVEL. AND ALSO WHERE DIFFERENT

03:30:42.230 --> 03:30:44.799 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS KIND OF STE FALL NOW

03:30:44.198 --> 03:30:47.802 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO WHERE YOU SET THAT

03:30:44.799 --> 03:30:48.970 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

03:30:47.802 --> 03:30:50.605 region:rollup2
MOVING INTO ITS AS AN

03:30:48.970 --> 03:30:52.006 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT PHYSICIAN

03:30:50.605 --> 03:30:53.741 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS THAT THE KIND OF

03:30:52.006 --> 03:30:55.076 region:rollup2
GENERAL OVER ARCHING STORY IS

03:30:53.741 --> 03:30:57.278 region:rollup2
PRETTY SIMILAR TO THE HOSPITAL

03:30:55.076 --> 03:30:59.547 region:rollup2
STORY IN THAT COMMERCIAL HEALTH

03:30:57.278 --> 03:31:01.716 region:rollup2
PLANS TEND TO PAY. A HIGHER THAN

03:30:59.547 --> 03:31:03.317 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID TENDS TO

03:31:01.716 --> 03:31:04.719 region:rollup2
PAY LESS THAN MEDICARE BUT

03:31:03.317 --> 03:31:06.387 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME KIND OF IMPORTANT

03:31:04.719 --> 03:31:07.655 region:rollup2
NUANCES OUR DIFFERENCES. AYE TO

03:31:06.387 --> 03:31:09.157 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH ON THE PHYSICIAN

03:31:07.655 --> 03:31:10.658 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT SIDE AS WELL.

03:31:09.157 --> 03:31:12.894 region:rollup2
BUT SO THE KINDA MEAN STARTING

03:31:10.658 --> 03:31:15.196 region:rollup2
POINT HERE SO THIS IS DATA ON A

03:31:12.894 --> 03:31:16.597 region:rollup2
NATIONAL AVERAGE PAYMENTS FOR A

03:31:15.196 --> 03:31:18.199 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE ESSENTIALLY OFFICE

03:31:16.597 --> 03:31:19.767 region:rollup2
VISIT CHECK UP.

03:31:18.199 --> 03:31:21.235 region:rollup2
AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT ON

03:31:19.767 --> 03:31:22.403 region:rollup2
AVERAGE OF PATIENTS WITH

03:31:21.235 --> 03:31:24.105 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE

03:31:22.403 --> 03:31:25.573 region:rollup2
COVERAGE POSITIONS THAT TREAT

03:31:24.105 --> 03:31:26.574 region:rollup2
THOSE PATIENTS ARE GETTING PAID

03:31:25.573 --> 03:31:27.742 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE ABOUT EIGHTEEN

03:31:26.574 --> 03:31:28.709 region:rollup2
PERCENT HIGHER THAN THEY GET

03:31:27.742 --> 03:31:30.278 region:rollup2
PAID FOR TREATING MEDICARE

03:31:28.709 --> 03:31:31.846 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

03:31:30.278 --> 03:31:33.414 region:rollup2
I'M SO AGAIN A MARKUP OVER

03:31:31.846 --> 03:31:34.582 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ALTHOUGH NOT AS BIG OF

03:31:33.414 --> 03:31:36.717 region:rollup2
A MARK UP AS WE SAW IN THE

03:31:34.582 --> 03:31:38.185 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL SIDE.

03:31:36.717 --> 03:31:39.720 region:rollup2
I'M IN CONTRAST THE THEY HAD A

03:31:38.185 --> 03:31:42.356 region:rollup2
RELATIVE PAYMENT LEVELS FROM

03:31:39.720 --> 03:31:43.824 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PLANS ARE MUCH LOWER ON

03:31:42.356 --> 03:31:45.026 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE THAT ON AVERAGE

03:31:43.824 --> 03:31:46.327 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY UP.

03:31:45.026 --> 03:31:48.229 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS GET PAID ABOUT THREE

03:31:46.327 --> 03:31:49.664 region:rollup2
QUARTERS. OF WHAT THEY WOULD

03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:51.566 region:rollup2
HAVE GOTTEN PAID FOR TREATING A

03:31:49.664 --> 03:31:54.035 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PATIENT WHEN THEY TREAT

03:31:51.566 --> 03:31:55.570 region:rollup2
A MEDICAID PATIENT.

03:31:54.035 --> 03:31:57.071 region:rollup2
STARTING FROM THIS KIND OF.

03:31:55.570 --> 03:31:58.806 region:rollup2
MARKUP OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN

03:31:57.071 --> 03:32:00.808 region:rollup2
PERCENT OVER MEDICARE FOR THE

03:31:58.806 --> 03:32:02.476 region:rollup2
COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS.

03:32:00.808 --> 03:32:04.345 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE THAT KIND OF A BASIS

03:32:02.476 --> 03:32:05.646 region:rollup2
FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS BUT

03:32:04.345 --> 03:32:07.648 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY SEE THAT THIS

03:32:05.646 --> 03:32:09.116 region:rollup2
RELATIVE MARKUP OVER MEDICARE

03:32:07.648 --> 03:32:11.385 region:rollup2
VARIES CONSIDERABLY ACROSS

03:32:09.116 --> 03:32:13.254 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PHYSICIANS.

03:32:11.385 --> 03:32:16.023 region:rollup2
AND WE SEE MUCH HIGHER MARKUPS

03:32:13.254 --> 03:32:17.525 region:rollup2
OVER MEDICARE OF FOR SPECIALISTS

03:32:16.023 --> 03:32:19.727 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE COMPARED TO THAT

03:32:17.525 --> 03:32:21.395 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN PERCENT HIGHER PAYMENT

03:32:19.727 --> 03:32:22.863 region:rollup2
FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS FOR

03:32:21.395 --> 03:32:24.899 region:rollup2
AN OFFICE VISIT.

03:32:22.863 --> 03:32:26.300 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE RADIOLOGISTS

03:32:24.899 --> 03:32:27.902 region:rollup2
INTERPRETING A CAT SCAN WOULD

03:32:26.300 --> 03:32:29.270 region:rollup2
GET PAID ABOUT DOUBLE FOR

03:32:27.902 --> 03:32:31.005 region:rollup2
TREATING A COMMERCIALLY INSURED

03:32:29.270 --> 03:32:31.939 region:rollup2
PATIENTS. OUT COMPARED TO WHAT

03:32:31.005 --> 03:32:34.542 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD GET FOR A MEDICARE

03:32:31.939 --> 03:32:35.776 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

03:32:34.542 --> 03:32:37.211 region:rollup2
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THOUGH IN

03:32:35.776 --> 03:32:38.646 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA AND

03:32:37.211 --> 03:32:40.514 region:rollup2
KIND OF HOW WE COMPARE TO THE

03:32:38.646 --> 03:32:41.649 region:rollup2
NATIONAL PICTURE IT TURNS OUT

03:32:40.514 --> 03:32:43.150 region:rollup2
THAT PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS IN

03:32:41.649 --> 03:32:44.685 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY APPEAR TO BE

03:32:43.150 --> 03:32:47.288 region:rollup2
DOINGA KIND OF BETTER JOB THAT

03:32:44.685 --> 03:32:48.823 region:rollup2
AVERAGE. AT CONSTRAINING THE USE

03:32:47.288 --> 03:32:50.424 region:rollup2
OF MARKUPS IN THE IN THE

03:32:48.823 --> 03:32:53.461 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL MARKET SO WHAT I MEAN

03:32:50.424 --> 03:32:55.196 region:rollup2
BY THAT IS THAT. COMMERCIAL A

03:32:53.461 --> 03:32:56.764 region:rollup2
PAYMENT RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

03:32:55.196 --> 03:32:57.898 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN AVERAGE ACROSS THE

03:32:56.764 --> 03:33:00.067 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

03:32:57.898 --> 03:33:01.802 region:rollup2
I MEAN YOU SEE AGAIN THAT.

03:33:00.067 --> 03:33:02.837 region:rollup2
COME THAT PAYMENT RATES TO

03:33:01.802 --> 03:33:04.472 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS FOR COMMERCIALLY

03:33:02.837 --> 03:33:05.306 region:rollup2
INSURED PATIENTS ARE HIGHER IN

03:33:04.472 --> 03:33:07.174 region:rollup2
SAN FRANCISCO THAN IN LOS

03:33:05.306 --> 03:33:08.409 region:rollup2
ANGELES BUT IN BOTH MARKETS IN

03:33:07.174 --> 03:33:10.144 region:rollup2
THIS CASE AT LEAST IN THIS YEAR

03:33:08.409 --> 03:33:13.614 region:rollup2
A SOURCE THEIR LOWER THAN THE

03:33:10.144 --> 03:33:14.815 region:rollup2
AVERAGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

03:33:13.614 --> 03:33:16.817 region:rollup2
I FINALLY ONE LAST POINT ON

03:33:14.815 --> 03:33:18.552 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN PAYMENTS IS FOCUSING

03:33:16.817 --> 03:33:19.654 region:rollup2
IN ON THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM AND

03:33:18.552 --> 03:33:21.822 region:rollup2
THIS IS ANOTHER.

03:33:19.654 --> 03:33:22.790 region:rollup2
SOURCE WHERE CALIFORNIA ANOTHER

03:33:21.822 --> 03:33:25.192 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA BEING A

03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:27.061 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY LOW OUT WIRE. SO

03:33:25.192 --> 03:33:28.362 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOW LOOKING AT MEDICAID

03:33:27.061 --> 03:33:29.964 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FOR TREATING A MEDICAID

03:33:28.362 --> 03:33:31.532 region:rollup2
PATIENT AS COMPARED TO A

03:33:29.964 --> 03:33:33.234 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PATIENT.

03:33:31.532 --> 03:33:34.568 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU SEE IS ON AVERAGE

03:33:33.234 --> 03:33:35.903 region:rollup2
POSITIONS GET PAID ABOUT THREE

03:33:34.568 --> 03:33:37.071 region:rollup2
QUARTERS OF?

03:33:35.903 --> 03:33:38.439 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN

03:33:37.071 --> 03:33:40.308 region:rollup2
PAID FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS WHEN

03:33:38.439 --> 03:33:42.043 region:rollup2
THEY TREAT A MEDICAID PATIENTS?

03:33:40.308 --> 03:33:43.044 region:rollup2
IN CONTRAST IN CALIFORNIA THAT

03:33:42.043 --> 03:33:44.712 region:rollup2
I'VE THAT'S CLOSER TO ABOUT HALF

03:33:43.044 --> 03:33:46.414 region:rollup2
AS MUCH.

03:33:44.712 --> 03:33:48.015 region:rollup2
SO PHYSICIANS ARE RECEIVING VERY

03:33:46.414 --> 03:33:50.484 region:rollup2
LOW REIMBURSEMENT FOR TREATING

03:33:48.015 --> 03:33:51.919 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PATIENTS BOTH COMPARED

03:33:50.484 --> 03:33:53.454 region:rollup2
TO OTHER PAYERS LIKE MEDICARE

03:33:51.919 --> 03:33:54.555 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IN COMPARE IN

03:33:53.454 --> 03:33:55.790 region:rollup2
COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES

03:33:54.555 --> 03:33:56.190 region:rollup2
AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE

03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:58.125 region:rollup2
A PARTICULARLY LOW

03:33:56.190 --> 03:33:59.894 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT.

03:33:58.125 --> 03:34:01.662 region:rollup2
OF RATE STRUCTURE FOR PHYSICIANS

03:33:59.894 --> 03:34:02.930 region:rollup2
IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM.

03:34:01.662 --> 03:34:04.932 region:rollup2
NOW THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS YOU'VE

03:34:02.930 --> 03:34:06.734 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT ON ACCESS AND

03:34:04.932 --> 03:34:07.635 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION BUT JUST ONE SLIDE

03:34:06.734 --> 03:34:09.737 region:rollup2
HERE TO TO.

03:34:07.635 --> 03:34:10.871 region:rollup2
KIND OF REITERATE THIS POINT

03:34:09.737 --> 03:34:12.540 region:rollup2
AND AND DRAW THE CONNECTION

03:34:10.871 --> 03:34:13.974 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PAYMENT RATE LEVELS AND

03:34:12.540 --> 03:34:15.042 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE.

03:34:13.974 --> 03:34:16.811 region:rollup2
ON THIS IS A SURVEY OF

03:34:15.042 --> 03:34:19.213 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS THAT ASKS.

03:34:16.811 --> 03:34:21.515 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ACCEPT

03:34:19.213 --> 03:34:23.017 region:rollup2
A NEW PATIENTS IN YOUR PRACTICE.

03:34:21.515 --> 03:34:24.051 region:rollup2
AT AND THEN FOLLOW THAT UP WITH

03:34:23.017 --> 03:34:25.386 region:rollup2
WHAT AND WHAT'S THEIR SOURCE OF

03:34:24.051 --> 03:34:26.721 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COVERAGE

03:34:25.386 --> 03:34:28.522 region:rollup2
AND SO ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT

03:34:26.721 --> 03:34:30.057 region:rollup2
SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF PHYSICIANS

03:34:28.522 --> 03:34:31.992 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT IN

03:34:30.057 --> 03:34:34.395 region:rollup2
NEW MEDICAID PATIENTS.

03:34:31.992 --> 03:34:35.996 region:rollup2
IN CONTRAST IN CALIFORNIA WERE

03:34:34.395 --> 03:34:37.732 region:rollup2
MUCH LOWER THAN THAT ABOUT FIFTY

03:34:35.996 --> 03:34:39.667 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT.

03:34:37.732 --> 03:34:41.202 region:rollup2
NOW IN CONTRAST IN CALIFORNIA

03:34:39.667 --> 03:34:42.136 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF

03:34:41.202 --> 03:34:44.538 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS SAY THEY WOULD BE

03:34:42.136 --> 03:34:46.040 region:rollup2
WILLING TO ACCEPT A NEW A A NEW

03:34:44.538 --> 03:34:47.675 region:rollup2
COMMERCIALLY INSURED OR OUT

03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:49.143 region:rollup2
MEDICARE INJURED PATIENT.

03:34:47.675 --> 03:34:50.478 region:rollup2
SO YOU DON'T NECESARIAMENTE

03:34:49.143 --> 03:34:52.313 region:rollup2
COMPARE THE FIFTY FOUR PERCENT

03:34:50.478 --> 03:34:53.514 region:rollup2
TO A HUNDRED BUT STILL WERE

03:34:52.313 --> 03:34:55.082 region:rollup2
CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE

03:34:53.514 --> 03:34:56.584 region:rollup2
NATIONAL AVERAGE IN TERMS OF

03:34:55.082 --> 03:34:57.985 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING A NEW MEDICAID PATIENT

03:34:56.584 --> 03:34:59.553 region:rollup2
AND ALSO MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT

03:34:57.985 --> 03:35:00.388 region:rollup2
YOU SEE. OF FOR COMMERCIALLY

03:34:59.553 --> 03:35:02.356 region:rollup2
INSURED AND MEDICARE INSURED

03:35:00.388 --> 03:35:03.624 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

03:35:02.356 --> 03:35:05.126 region:rollup2
SO ESSENTIALLY JUST JUST

03:35:03.624 --> 03:35:07.061 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZE OF WHAT I SAID ON

03:35:05.126 --> 03:35:08.562 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS. THAT COMMERCIAL

03:35:07.061 --> 03:35:10.965 region:rollup2
MARKUPS OVER MEDICARE.

03:35:08.562 --> 03:35:12.566 region:rollup2
EXIST IN THE PHYSICIAN MARKET

03:35:10.965 --> 03:35:13.901 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ON AVERAGE AS WELL.

03:35:12.566 --> 03:35:15.603 region:rollup2
THEIR MORE MODEST FOR OFFICE

03:35:13.901 --> 03:35:17.138 region:rollup2
VISITS AND TEND TO BE MUCH

03:35:15.603 --> 03:35:19.140 region:rollup2
HIGHER FOR SPECIALISTS.

03:35:17.138 --> 03:35:20.574 region:rollup2
ON CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE HEALTH

03:35:19.140 --> 03:35:21.876 region:rollup2
INSURERS APPEAR TO BE DOING HAVE

03:35:20.574 --> 03:35:24.111 region:rollup2
A BETTER JOB THAN THE NATIONAL

03:35:21.876 --> 03:35:26.147 region:rollup2
AVERAGE IN TERMS OF HOLDING DOWN

03:35:24.111 --> 03:35:27.748 region:rollup2
THESE MARKUPS OVER MEDICARE FOR.

03:35:26.147 --> 03:35:30.017 region:rollup2
FOR COMMERCIALLY INSURED

03:35:27.748 --> 03:35:31.385 region:rollup2
PATIENTS BUT MEDI CAL PHYSICIAN

03:35:30.017 --> 03:35:32.486 region:rollup2
FEES ARE PARTICULARLY LOW

03:35:31.385 --> 03:35:34.922 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN COMPARISON TO

03:35:32.486 --> 03:35:36.657 region:rollup2
NATIONAL METRICS.

03:35:34.922 --> 03:35:38.559 region:rollup2
SO TAKE AWAY POINTS ON PROVIDER

03:35:36.657 --> 03:35:39.360 region:rollup2
PAYMENT OVER ALL I THINK IF I

03:35:38.559 --> 03:35:41.395 region:rollup2
CAN LEAVE YOU.

03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:42.930 region:rollup2
WITH WITH TWO MAIN POINTS OF

03:35:41.395 --> 03:35:44.331 region:rollup2
AND IT SAYS ONE IS THAT

03:35:42.930 --> 03:35:45.833 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT US SORT DIFFERENT

03:35:44.331 --> 03:35:47.134 region:rollup2
PAYERS ARE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF

03:35:45.833 --> 03:35:49.336 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. ARE

03:35:47.134 --> 03:35:50.538 region:rollup2
PAYING PROVIDERS VERY DIFFERENT

03:35:49.336 --> 03:35:51.806 region:rollup2
RATES FOR DOING THIS SEEMS

03:35:50.538 --> 03:35:53.207 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROVIDING THE SAME

03:35:51.806 --> 03:35:54.809 region:rollup2
SERVICE TO PATIENTS.

03:35:53.207 --> 03:35:56.610 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU NO IT THAT KIND OF

03:35:54.809 --> 03:35:57.611 region:rollup2
SPECIFICS VARY BUT THE GENERAL

03:35:56.610 --> 03:35:59.079 region:rollup2
MESSAGE IS THAT IF YOU THINK

03:35:57.611 --> 03:36:00.448 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO MEDICARE BEING IN

03:35:59.079 --> 03:36:01.882 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE THAT PRIVATE HEALTH

03:36:00.448 --> 03:36:03.717 region:rollup2
INSURERS ARE PAYING MUCH MORE

03:36:01.882 --> 03:36:06.153 region:rollup2
THAN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID TENDS

03:36:03.717 --> 03:36:08.389 region:rollup2
TO BE PAYING. LESS THAN MEDICARE

03:36:06.153 --> 03:36:09.523 region:rollup2
NOW HOW BIG THOSE GAPS ARE AND

03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:11.058 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THAT TYPE OF THING

03:36:09.523 --> 03:36:12.359 region:rollup2
VARIES ACROSS DIFFERENT TYPES OF

03:36:11.058 --> 03:36:13.894 region:rollup2
SERVICES DIFFERENT HOSPITALS

03:36:12.359 --> 03:36:15.696 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SPECIALISTS. ON

03:36:13.894 --> 03:36:17.064 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PRACTICES ALL OF THOSE

03:36:15.696 --> 03:36:18.332 region:rollup2
THINGS BUT THE GENERAL MESSAGES.

03:36:17.064 --> 03:36:20.668 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IN THE MIDDLE PRIVATE

03:36:18.332 --> 03:36:21.702 region:rollup2
INSURANCE ABOVE MEDICAID BELOW.

03:36:20.668 --> 03:36:22.870 region:rollup2
I THINK THE SECOND POINT IS

03:36:21.702 --> 03:36:24.438 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY JUST THAT YOU KNOW

03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:25.906 region:rollup2
FOODS IN KIND OF PICKING UP ON

03:36:24.438 --> 03:36:27.341 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THE FRAGMENTATION

03:36:25.906 --> 03:36:29.677 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED.

03:36:27.341 --> 03:36:30.611 region:rollup2
THAT THESE UP PROVIDERS HAVE TO

03:36:29.677 --> 03:36:33.681 region:rollup2
KIND OF DEAL WITH THE

03:36:30.611 --> 03:36:35.416 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES OF YOU

03:36:33.681 --> 03:36:36.417 region:rollup2
KNOW SENDING OF OF NEGOTIATING

03:36:35.416 --> 03:36:38.018 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS WITH MANY DIFFERENT

03:36:36.417 --> 03:36:38.185 region:rollup2
PAYERS.

03:36:38.018 --> 03:36:40.287 region:rollup2
OF.

03:36:38.185 --> 03:36:41.121 region:rollup2
.

03:36:40.287 --> 03:36:42.656 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY LEARNING HOW TO

03:36:41.121 --> 03:36:43.891 region:rollup2
SUBMIT THEIR CLEANS AND

03:36:42.656 --> 03:36:45.192 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY KIND OF GET THESE

03:36:43.891 --> 03:36:47.461 region:rollup2
THINGS PROCESS WITH THESE

03:36:45.192 --> 03:36:48.796 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PAYERS. AND ALSO MANY

03:36:47.461 --> 03:36:50.598 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PAYERS YOU KNOW HAVE

03:36:48.796 --> 03:36:52.833 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR

03:36:50.598 --> 03:36:55.002 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS ARE FOR HOSPITALS AND

03:36:52.833 --> 03:36:56.570 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MEDICARE INCENTIVIZE IS

03:36:55.002 --> 03:36:58.239 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR TYPES OF CARE.

03:36:56.570 --> 03:36:59.673 region:rollup2
MEDICAID MAY HAVE DIFFERENT

03:36:58.239 --> 03:37:01.208 region:rollup2
KIND OF GOALS ARE DIFFERENT.%

03:36:59.673 --> 03:37:03.143 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL LEVERS TO IN

03:37:01.208 --> 03:37:04.879 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE POSITION AND BEHAVIOR

03:37:03.143 --> 03:37:06.881 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL BEHAVIOR EVEN DIFFERENT

03:37:04.879 --> 03:37:07.882 region:rollup2
PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS YOU KNOW

03:37:06.881 --> 03:37:09.583 region:rollup2
ONE MAY BE IMPLEMENTING A PAY

03:37:07.882 --> 03:37:11.118 region:rollup2
FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAM ANOTHER

03:37:09.583 --> 03:37:13.821 region:rollup2
MAYBE IMPLEMENTING. MORE ABOUT

03:37:11.118 --> 03:37:15.089 region:rollup2
KIND OF VALUE BASED CARE OR KIND

03:37:13.821 --> 03:37:17.524 region:rollup2
OF THE ON TOTAL COST OF CARE

03:37:15.089 --> 03:37:18.859 region:rollup2
TYPE PROGRAM. AND AND PROVIDERS

03:37:17.524 --> 03:37:20.694 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOU

03:37:18.859 --> 03:37:21.662 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW DO I RECONCILE ALL OF

03:37:20.694 --> 03:37:23.163 region:rollup2
THESE DIFFERENT INCENTIVES ALL

03:37:21.662 --> 03:37:24.298 region:rollup2
OF THESE DIFFERENT INTERACTIONS

03:37:23.163 --> 03:37:24.865 region:rollup2
WITH PAYERS.

03:37:24.298 --> 03:37:26.233 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ADMINISTRATIVELY

03:37:24.865 --> 03:37:28.068 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING IT CAN ALSO BE

03:37:26.233 --> 03:37:29.737 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO SHAPE

03:37:28.068 --> 03:37:31.171 region:rollup2
THEIR KIND OF PRACTICE DECISIONS

03:37:29.737 --> 03:37:32.106 region:rollup2
AROUND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT.

03:37:31.171 --> 03:37:33.274 region:rollup2
OUR CONTRACTS THAT THEY'RE

03:37:32.106 --> 03:37:34.842 region:rollup2
PRESENTED WITH IN THIS

03:37:33.274 --> 03:37:36.577 region:rollup2
FRAGMENTED SYSTEM TODAY.

03:37:34.842 --> 03:37:38.279 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:37:36.577 --> 03:37:39.413 region:rollup2
MOVING TOWARD A MORE UNIFIED

03:37:38.279 --> 03:37:40.781 region:rollup2
KIND OF RESTRUCTURE IS THINKING

03:37:39.413 --> 03:37:41.982 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOU COULD KIND OF

03:37:40.781 --> 03:37:43.584 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED THOSE PROCESS THESE

03:37:41.982 --> 03:37:44.652 region:rollup2
AND YOU WOULD HAVE A VERY LARGE

03:37:43.584 --> 03:37:46.754 region:rollup2
PATIENT VOLUME YOU COULD

03:37:44.652 --> 03:37:48.055 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY REALLY. ON ENCOURAGE

03:37:46.754 --> 03:37:49.089 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS TO DO DIFFERENT

03:37:48.055 --> 03:37:49.990 region:rollup2
THINGS WITH THEIR PATIENTS WHEN

03:37:49.089 --> 03:37:51.158 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF

03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:51.959 region:rollup2
THEIR PATIENTS AND NOT JUST A

03:37:51.158 --> 03:37:53.894 region:rollup2
THIRD OF THEIR PATIENTS ARE HALF

03:37:51.959 --> 03:37:55.763 region:rollup2
OF THEIR VISION.

03:37:53.894 --> 03:37:58.332 region:rollup2
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW

03:37:55.763 --> 03:38:01.201 region:rollup2
WE WHEN WE HAD A MOVE TOWARD ONE

03:37:58.332 --> 03:38:03.037 region:rollup2
SINGULAR APPROACH FIRST OF ALL.

03:38:01.201 --> 03:38:04.538 region:rollup2
GET SETTING NOT THAT GREAT LEVEL

03:38:03.037 --> 03:38:06.073 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN THAT KIND OF MECHANISM

03:38:04.538 --> 03:38:07.207 region:rollup2
RIGHT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT AND

03:38:06.073 --> 03:38:08.242 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY CHALLENGING AND

03:38:07.207 --> 03:38:09.810 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO MEAN DIFFERENT

03:38:08.242 --> 03:38:10.344 region:rollup2
THINGS FOR DIFFERENT PROVIDERS

03:38:09.810 --> 03:38:11.345 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY ARE

03:38:10.344 --> 03:38:13.581 region:rollup2
TODAY.

03:38:11.345 --> 03:38:15.516 region:rollup2
IT ALSO CAN STIFLE SOME OF THESE

03:38:13.581 --> 03:38:16.884 region:rollup2
ARE POTENTIAL INNOVATIONS IF ONE

03:38:15.516 --> 03:38:18.152 region:rollup2
INSURER IS THINKING OF SOMETHING

03:38:16.884 --> 03:38:19.386 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN MEDICARE

03:38:18.152 --> 03:38:20.621 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN A DIFFERENT

03:38:19.386 --> 03:38:21.889 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURER.

03:38:20.621 --> 03:38:23.157 region:rollup2
IF YOU MOVE JUST TOWARD ONE

03:38:21.889 --> 03:38:24.558 region:rollup2
APPROACH YOU LOSE SOME OF THAT

03:38:23.157 --> 03:38:25.960 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AND EXPERIMENTATION

03:38:24.558 --> 03:38:26.927 region:rollup2
AND SEEING WHAT WORKS AND WHAT

03:38:25.960 --> 03:38:28.162 region:rollup2
WORKS MIGHT DIFFER IN DIFFERENT

03:38:26.927 --> 03:38:29.663 region:rollup2
SETTINGS.

03:38:28.162 --> 03:38:31.432 region:rollup2
SO YOU MAY LOSE SOME OF THE

03:38:29.663 --> 03:38:34.001 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO KIND OF MONITOR AND

03:38:31.432 --> 03:38:35.536 region:rollup2
EVALUATE AND FALLS IN THAT WAY.

03:38:34.001 --> 03:38:36.103 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK ESSENTIALLY THE

03:38:35.536 --> 03:38:37.871 region:rollup2
POINT IS YOU KNOW THERE ARE

03:38:36.103 --> 03:38:40.474 region:rollup2
MANY.

03:38:37.871 --> 03:38:42.176 region:rollup2
KIND OF CONCERNS AND CHALLENGES

03:38:40.474 --> 03:38:44.211 region:rollup2
AND ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES.

03:38:42.176 --> 03:38:46.347 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE KIND OF CURRENT

03:38:44.211 --> 03:38:47.748 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TODAY PROVIDERS RECEIVE

03:38:46.347 --> 03:38:49.416 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT PAYMENT LEVELS

03:38:47.748 --> 03:38:50.584 region:rollup2
ACROSS THEIR DIFFERENT PATIENTS.

03:38:49.416 --> 03:38:51.885 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU KNOW THERE

03:38:50.584 --> 03:38:53.954 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES IN MOVING TOWARD A

03:38:51.885 --> 03:38:55.289 region:rollup2
UNIFIED APPROACH BUT IT'S NOT

03:38:53.954 --> 03:38:57.524 region:rollup2
IT'S AT NOT.

03:38:55.289 --> 03:38:58.659 region:rollup2
SMALL HURDLE TO THINK ABOUT

03:38:57.524 --> 03:39:00.694 region:rollup2
SETTING THAT.

03:38:58.659 --> 03:39:02.029 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY THAT'S GOING TO

03:39:00.694 --> 03:39:03.397 region:rollup2
REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

03:39:02.029 --> 03:39:04.665 region:rollup2
FROM THE STATUS QUO THAT'S GOING

03:39:03.397 --> 03:39:06.333 region:rollup2
TO MEAN VERY DIFFERENT THINGS TO

03:39:04.665 --> 03:39:07.301 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROVIDERS. AND IT'S

03:39:06.333 --> 03:39:09.003 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT TO KIND OF

03:39:07.301 --> 03:39:11.372 region:rollup2
STEPPED OUT AT THE RIGHT LEVEL

03:39:09.003 --> 03:39:12.573 region:rollup2
AND DOING SO WILL HAVE VERY HURT

03:39:11.372 --> 03:39:13.907 region:rollup2
OR NOT DOING SO WOULD

03:39:12.573 --> 03:39:14.875 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY HAVE. VERY

03:39:13.907 --> 03:39:16.810 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC POTENTIALLY VERY

03:39:14.875 --> 03:39:18.712 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC CONSEQUENCES ON A

03:39:16.810 --> 03:39:20.714 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ANGLES.

03:39:18.712 --> 03:39:21.615 region:rollup2
AND A PATH NOT.

03:39:20.714 --> 03:39:23.050 region:rollup2
GREAT BIG THANK YOU.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO STUDY

03:39:34.395 --> 03:39:37.331 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES FACING THE HEALTHCARE

03:39:35.262 --> 03:39:39.700 region:rollup2
SYSTEM?

03:39:50.310 --> 03:39:53.747 region:rollup2
TALK WITH YOU ABOUT PRICE

03:39:51.512 --> 03:39:54.848 region:rollup2
VARIATIONS AND CONSOLIDATION SO

03:39:53.747 --> 03:39:55.249 region:rollup2
BE BASED ON SOME OF THE WORK

03:39:54.848 --> 03:39:57.151 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:39:55.249 --> 03:39:59.553 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE DONE WITH COLLEAGUES

03:39:57.151 --> 03:40:01.221 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS HAVE DONE. I'M.

03:39:59.553 --> 03:40:02.122 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HE SO I WAS I MIGHT THE

03:40:01.221 --> 03:40:03.524 region:rollup2
OUTLINE GENERALLY SUPPLY CLIP

03:40:02.122 --> 03:40:05.726 region:rollup2
ABOUT PRICE VARIATIONS

03:40:03.524 --> 03:40:07.361 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AND HOSPITALS AND

03:40:05.726 --> 03:40:08.829 region:rollup2
DOCTOR TRISH IS DONE A LITTLE

03:40:07.361 --> 03:40:10.030 region:rollup2
BIT OF THAT SO OUT.

03:40:08.829 --> 03:40:11.565 region:rollup2
IT PASSED A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

03:40:10.030 --> 03:40:13.434 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING AND I WANT TO TALK

03:40:11.565 --> 03:40:14.768 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ROLE OF CONSOLIDATION

03:40:13.434 --> 03:40:16.537 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL MERGERS

03:40:14.768 --> 03:40:18.105 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AND THEIR EFFECT ON

03:40:16.537 --> 03:40:19.373 region:rollup2
PRICES AND HOW WE.

03:40:18.105 --> 03:40:20.274 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THAT AND THEN COME

03:40:19.373 --> 03:40:21.975 region:rollup2
AROUND AT THE END TOO LITTLE

03:40:20.274 --> 03:40:22.876 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF SOME THINGS THAT A

03:40:21.975 --> 03:40:23.377 region:rollup2
STATE MIGHT THINK ABOUT IN TERMS

03:40:22.876 --> 03:40:24.812 region:rollup2
OF.

03:40:23.377 --> 03:40:25.412 region:rollup2
MANAGING SOME OF THE PRICE

03:40:24.812 --> 03:40:29.183 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THE HEALTH

03:40:25.412 --> 03:40:30.751 region:rollup2
CARE SO.

03:40:29.183 --> 03:40:32.986 region:rollup2
HOW ONE GUY TO SPEND THE CONTEXT

03:40:30.751 --> 03:40:35.222 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE IS REALLY EXPENSIVE?

03:40:32.986 --> 03:40:36.490 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD TWEAK THAT.

03:40:35.222 --> 03:40:37.825 region:rollup2
PRICES ARE AN IMPORTANT

03:40:36.490 --> 03:40:39.626 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING

03:40:37.825 --> 03:40:41.161 region:rollup2
INCREASES WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

03:40:39.626 --> 03:40:42.296 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT BUT WE WE USE A LOT

03:40:41.161 --> 03:40:43.363 region:rollup2
OF HEALTH CARE IN THE THE TYPES

03:40:42.296 --> 03:40:45.132 region:rollup2
AND THE AMOUNTS OF HEALTH CARE

03:40:43.363 --> 03:40:46.900 region:rollup2
WE CONSUMER PART OF OUR STORY.

03:40:45.132 --> 03:40:48.235 region:rollup2
BUT PRICES PARTICULARLY OVER THE

03:40:46.900 --> 03:40:49.636 region:rollup2
LAST FIVE OR TEN YEARS HAVE BEEN

03:40:48.235 --> 03:40:50.170 region:rollup2
OF A BIG PART OF IT OF THE

03:40:49.636 --> 03:40:51.405 region:rollup2
INCREASES THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:40:50.170 --> 03:40:52.906 region:rollup2
SEEING.

03:40:51.405 --> 03:40:54.875 region:rollup2
I AND THE PART OF THE STORY WITH

03:40:52.906 --> 03:40:55.976 region:rollup2
PRICES IS THE FACT THAT WE TEND

03:40:54.875 --> 03:40:57.845 region:rollup2
TO USE MARKET MECHANISMS AT

03:40:55.976 --> 03:40:59.246 region:rollup2
LEAST QUITE OFTEN IN THE U. S.

03:40:57.845 --> 03:41:00.881 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA.

03:40:59.246 --> 03:41:02.516 region:rollup2
TO SET THESE PRICES MARKETS HAVE

03:41:00.881 --> 03:41:04.485 region:rollup2
SOME THINGS TO RECOMMEND THEM IN

03:41:02.516 --> 03:41:06.620 region:rollup2
MARKETS CAN FAIL. AND IF MARKETS

03:41:04.485 --> 03:41:07.621 region:rollup2
FAIL THEN WE MAY COME UP WITH

03:41:06.620 --> 03:41:07.821 region:rollup2
PRICES THAT WERE NOT SO HAPPY

03:41:07.621 --> 03:41:09.389 region:rollup2
WITH.

03:41:07.821 --> 03:41:11.358 region:rollup2
.

03:41:09.389 --> 03:41:13.327 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION MERGERS THE

03:41:11.358 --> 03:41:15.229 region:rollup2
FORMATION VERY LARGE SYSTEMS AND

03:41:13.327 --> 03:41:16.463 region:rollup2
PROVIDER NETWORKS IS AYE IS PART

03:41:15.229 --> 03:41:20.167 region:rollup2
OF THE STORY OF MARKET FAILURE

03:41:16.463 --> 03:41:21.335 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY IN THE HEALTHCARE.

03:41:20.167 --> 03:41:23.737 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE SO

03:41:21.335 --> 03:41:24.938 region:rollup2
VERY JUST OUT TO SO MOST SKIP

03:41:23.737 --> 03:41:26.173 region:rollup2
PAST THIS IMMEDIATELY HEALTHCARE

03:41:24.938 --> 03:41:27.875 region:rollup2
PRICES OF BEEN RISING VERY

03:41:26.173 --> 03:41:28.308 region:rollup2
QUICKLY HOSPITALS ARE A PART OF

03:41:27.875 --> 03:41:30.210 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:41:28.308 --> 03:41:31.612 region:rollup2
THIS SLIDE HIGHLIGHTS SIX

03:41:30.210 --> 03:41:33.647 region:rollup2
PERCENT INCREASES IN TWO

03:41:31.612 --> 03:41:34.548 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIFTEEN ALONE IN

03:41:33.647 --> 03:41:37.317 region:rollup2
MEDICAL HOSPITAL ADMISSION

03:41:34.548 --> 03:41:38.352 region:rollup2
PRICES. AYE THAT'S CONSIDERABLY

03:41:37.317 --> 03:41:40.387 region:rollup2
FASTER THAN INFLATION IT'S A

03:41:38.352 --> 03:41:42.156 region:rollup2
GOOD COMPONENT OF RAPIDLY RISING

03:41:40.387 --> 03:41:43.590 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE COSTS AND IT GOES

03:41:42.156 --> 03:41:44.892 region:rollup2
ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS I'M

03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:45.526 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON HOSPITALS

03:41:44.892 --> 03:41:48.128 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IT SO YOU SEE THAT

03:41:45.526 --> 03:41:50.230 region:rollup2
HOUSE.

03:41:48.128 --> 03:41:52.199 region:rollup2
AS DOCTOR TRICIA'S MENTIONED

03:41:50.230 --> 03:41:53.767 region:rollup2
THERE ARE IMPORTANT VARIATIONS

03:41:52.199 --> 03:41:56.003 region:rollup2
IN HOSPITAL PRICES AROUND THE

03:41:53.767 --> 03:41:57.538 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AND WITH IN CALIFORNIA.

03:41:56.003 --> 03:41:59.773 region:rollup2
THIS IS IN SOME SENSE A

03:41:57.538 --> 03:42:01.441 region:rollup2
REITERATION OF THE SLIDE THAT

03:41:59.773 --> 03:42:03.277 region:rollup2
THAT SHE HAD A MOMENT AGO AYE

03:42:01.441 --> 03:42:04.011 region:rollup2
THIS SIMPLY COLORS PARTS OF

03:42:03.277 --> 03:42:06.313 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND PARTS OF THE

03:42:04.011 --> 03:42:07.948 region:rollup2
COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO AN AVERAGE

03:42:06.313 --> 03:42:09.316 region:rollup2
PRICE FOR A HOT A BASKET OF

03:42:07.948 --> 03:42:11.318 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL SERVICES CALCULATED

03:42:09.316 --> 03:42:13.086 region:rollup2
FROM ABOUT DATA FROM PRIVATE

03:42:11.318 --> 03:42:14.321 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

03:42:13.086 --> 03:42:15.556 region:rollup2
I AND THE DARKEST BLUE AREAS ARE

03:42:14.321 --> 03:42:17.724 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST THE LATEST BLUE

03:42:15.556 --> 03:42:19.259 region:rollup2
AREAS ARE THE LOWEST AND IF I'M

03:42:17.724 --> 03:42:20.794 region:rollup2
PERMITTED A CERTAIN STATISTICAL

03:42:19.259 --> 03:42:22.329 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY THERE'S ABOUT A

03:42:20.794 --> 03:42:25.165 region:rollup2
THREE TIMES DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

03:42:22.329 --> 03:42:27.234 region:rollup2
THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM HERE.

03:42:25.165 --> 03:42:28.969 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU SEE CVM. THAT PARTS

03:42:27.234 --> 03:42:30.504 region:rollup2
OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MORE%

03:42:28.969 --> 03:42:31.805 region:rollup2
OFTEN LOOKING A LITTLE BIT

03:42:30.504 --> 03:42:33.373 region:rollup2
LIGHTER COLORED THAN PARTS OF

03:42:31.805 --> 03:42:34.641 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOME BIG

03:42:33.373 --> 03:42:36.176 region:rollup2
PRICE DIFFERENCES WITHIN

03:42:34.641 --> 03:42:37.044 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT OF COURSE IF YOU

03:42:36.176 --> 03:42:38.845 region:rollup2
LOOK AROUND THE STATEMENT RUN

03:42:37.044 --> 03:42:40.280 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY. THINGS VERY QUITE A

03:42:38.845 --> 03:42:41.481 region:rollup2
BIT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER.

03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:44.518 region:rollup2
SIMILARLY TO WHAT WE'RE JUST

03:42:41.481 --> 03:42:46.286 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

03:42:44.518 --> 03:42:47.020 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA SKIP TO THIS SLIDE

03:42:46.286 --> 03:42:48.889 region:rollup2
RIGHT HERE.

03:42:47.020 --> 03:42:50.724 region:rollup2
THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES

03:42:48.889 --> 03:42:52.559 region:rollup2
ACROSS PAYERS AGAIN IS DOCTOR

03:42:50.724 --> 03:42:54.828 region:rollup2
TRICIA'S POINTED OUT MEDICAID

03:42:52.559 --> 03:42:58.198 region:rollup2
AND MEDICARE PRICES ARE OFTEN

03:42:54.828 --> 03:42:59.600 region:rollup2
LOWER. THEN COMMERCIAL PRICES

03:42:58.198 --> 03:43:01.535 region:rollup2
ARE AND THE ONLY POINT THAT I

03:42:59.600 --> 03:43:03.036 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE TO ADD ON TO THAT IS

03:43:01.535 --> 03:43:04.438 region:rollup2
THAT FOR IS IN THE SLIDE HERE

03:43:03.036 --> 03:43:05.472 region:rollup2
WHICH IS BASED ON WORK THAT I

03:43:04.438 --> 03:43:07.441 region:rollup2
DID WITH COLLEAGUES A LITTLE

03:43:05.472 --> 03:43:08.775 region:rollup2
WHILE AGO IN WHICH WE. LOOKED AT

03:43:07.441 --> 03:43:10.577 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PRICES COMPARED TO

03:43:08.775 --> 03:43:12.379 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PRICES BUT ALSO

03:43:10.577 --> 03:43:13.847 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

03:43:12.379 --> 03:43:15.816 region:rollup2
PRICES.

03:43:13.847 --> 03:43:17.551 region:rollup2
I MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS ARE

03:43:15.816 --> 03:43:19.086 region:rollup2
ARE PRIVATE PLANS A CONTRACT

03:43:17.551 --> 03:43:20.888 region:rollup2
WITH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TO

03:43:19.086 --> 03:43:22.656 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE SENIORS ARE WHO

03:43:20.888 --> 03:43:23.924 region:rollup2
ELECTED ROLE IN THOSE PLANS.

03:43:22.656 --> 03:43:25.225 region:rollup2
AND THOSE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

03:43:23.924 --> 03:43:26.727 region:rollup2
PLANS LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE

03:43:25.225 --> 03:43:28.161 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PLANS IN THAT THEY

03:43:26.727 --> 03:43:29.630 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE THE PRICES WITH

03:43:28.161 --> 03:43:31.231 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:32.1000 region:rollup2
IN THEIR NETWORK SO THEY HAVE A.

03:43:31.231 --> 03:43:35.269 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

03:43:32.1000 --> 03:43:37.037 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE PRICES THAT ARE USED

03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:38.505 region:rollup2
FOR HOSPITALS OUT WENT OUT.

03:43:37.037 --> 03:43:39.973 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL MEDICARE PATIENT IS

03:43:38.505 --> 03:43:41.875 region:rollup2
SEEN AT A HOSPITAL WHICH ARE

03:43:39.973 --> 03:43:42.843 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED PRICES SET OUT

03:43:41.875 --> 03:43:44.878 region:rollup2
THROUGH A ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS

03:43:42.843 --> 03:43:46.313 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON.

03:43:44.878 --> 03:43:48.048 region:rollup2
AND COMMIT AND MEDICARE

03:43:46.313 --> 03:43:49.316 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE PRICES WHEN A SENIOR

03:43:48.048 --> 03:43:50.217 region:rollup2
AND A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN

03:43:49.316 --> 03:43:51.652 region:rollup2
GOES TO THE HOSPITAL THEY'LL

03:43:50.217 --> 03:43:53.587 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THE HOSPITAL WILL BE

03:43:51.652 --> 03:43:56.089 region:rollup2
PAID OUT NEGOTIATED RATE WITH

03:43:53.587 --> 03:43:58.058 region:rollup2
THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN.

03:43:56.089 --> 03:43:59.760 region:rollup2
WHEN WE MAKE COMPARISONS HERE WE

03:43:58.058 --> 03:44:01.128 region:rollup2
IN THIS PARTICULAR PAPER IN THE

03:43:59.760 --> 03:44:02.930 region:rollup2
STUDY WE LOOKED AT FEE FOR

03:44:01.128 --> 03:44:04.398 region:rollup2
SERVICE MEDICARE PRICES IN TWO

03:44:02.930 --> 03:44:06.133 region:rollup2
THOUSAND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND

03:44:04.398 --> 03:44:07.768 region:rollup2
TWELVE FOR A BASKET OF TWENTY

03:44:06.133 --> 03:44:09.636 region:rollup2
FIVE COMMENT SERVICES. AND WE

03:44:07.768 --> 03:44:11.505 region:rollup2
LABEL THAT PRICE ONE HUNDRED IN

03:44:09.636 --> 03:44:12.773 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE IN THE RED BAR.

03:44:11.505 --> 03:44:14.308 region:rollup2
WE THEN LOOK AT THE PRICES THAT

03:44:12.773 --> 03:44:15.676 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PLANS ARE PAYING FOR

03:44:14.308 --> 03:44:17.077 region:rollup2
THAT SAME BASKET IN THE SAME

03:44:15.676 --> 03:44:18.912 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. WE SEE THE

03:44:17.077 --> 03:44:20.714 region:rollup2
GREEN BARS IN THEIR CONSIDERABLY

03:44:18.912 --> 03:44:22.749 region:rollup2
HIGHER AS WE. NOTED BEFORE.

03:44:20.714 --> 03:44:24.484 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE PERCENT HIGHER IN

03:44:22.749 --> 03:44:25.619 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE.

03:44:24.484 --> 03:44:27.721 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WE LOOK AT THE MEDICARE

03:44:25.619 --> 03:44:28.822 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE PRICES SAME BUNDLE OF

03:44:27.721 --> 03:44:30.924 region:rollup2
SERVICES AGAIN IN THE SAME

03:44:28.822 --> 03:44:32.826 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS PAID BY NOW

03:44:30.924 --> 03:44:33.460 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS. AND

03:44:32.826 --> 03:44:36.363 region:rollup2
HERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY WILL BE

03:44:33.460 --> 03:44:37.998 region:rollup2
LOWER NINETY PERCENT NINETY ONE

03:44:36.363 --> 03:44:39.700 region:rollup2
PERCENT EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE.

03:44:37.998 --> 03:44:41.368 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO COMMERCIAL PLANS IN A

03:44:39.700 --> 03:44:42.569 region:rollup2
LOT OF WAYS AND I WANT TO POINT

03:44:41.368 --> 03:44:43.870 region:rollup2
OUT THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WILL

03:44:42.569 --> 03:44:45.706 region:rollup2
COME UP WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:47.774 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE. THAT ACTIONS THAT

03:44:45.706 --> 03:44:49.710 region:rollup2
SOMEONE MIGHT TAKE.

03:44:47.774 --> 03:44:50.310 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO US WHEN WE DID THIS

03:44:49.710 --> 03:44:52.012 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND LOOKED AT THESE

03:44:50.310 --> 03:44:53.480 region:rollup2
RESULTS THAT HAVE VERY PORTANT

03:44:52.012 --> 03:44:54.348 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION IS THAT.

03:44:53.480 --> 03:44:56.650 region:rollup2
CONTEXT IN WHICH THE

03:44:54.348 --> 03:44:58.151 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATIONS HAPPENING.

03:44:56.650 --> 03:44:59.886 region:rollup2
IN A COMMERCIAL PLAN ADDICT IN

03:44:58.151 --> 03:45:01.421 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCIAL PLAN CONTACTS IF

03:44:59.886 --> 03:45:03.123 region:rollup2
A HOSPITAL IN A PLAN DON'T REACH

03:45:01.421 --> 03:45:04.758 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT. AND THE HOSPITAL IS

03:45:03.123 --> 03:45:05.325 region:rollup2
LEFT OUT OF THE NETWORK OF THE

03:45:04.758 --> 03:45:07.894 region:rollup2
PLAN IF A. PERSON FROM THAT

03:45:05.325 --> 03:45:10.263 region:rollup2
PLAN.

03:45:07.894 --> 03:45:11.498 region:rollup2
GOES TO THE HOSPITAL THEY. WILL

03:45:10.263 --> 03:45:13.200 region:rollup2
BE CHARGED OUT OF NETWORK RATES

03:45:11.498 --> 03:45:15.502 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN BE SET AT THE

03:45:13.200 --> 03:45:16.136 region:rollup2
DISCRETION OF THE HOSPITAL AND.

03:45:15.502 --> 03:45:18.005 region:rollup2
THIS I'M SURE OFTEN CAN BE QUITE

03:45:16.136 --> 03:45:19.306 region:rollup2
HIGH.

03:45:18.005 --> 03:45:20.107 region:rollup2
IN THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

03:45:19.306 --> 03:45:22.309 region:rollup2
CONTACTS WHEN.

03:45:20.107 --> 03:45:23.877 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN NEGOTIATES WITH A

03:45:22.309 --> 03:45:25.612 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL IF THEY DON'T REACH AN

03:45:23.877 --> 03:45:27.381 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT AND THE HOT HOSPITALS

03:45:25.612 --> 03:45:28.915 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE NETWORK. BUT A

03:45:27.381 --> 03:45:30.917 region:rollup2
PATIENT GOES THERE ANYWAY THE

03:45:28.915 --> 03:45:33.020 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL IS PAID THE MEDICARE

03:45:30.917 --> 03:45:33.954 region:rollup2
FEE FOR SERVICE RATE THEY DO NOT

03:45:33.020 --> 03:45:34.821 region:rollup2
GET TO SET THE RATE THAT THEY

03:45:33.954 --> 03:45:36.189 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE.

03:45:34.821 --> 03:45:37.624 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT AND TO IT THERE

03:45:36.189 --> 03:45:38.792 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINED TO NEGOTIATE WITHIN

03:45:37.624 --> 03:45:40.527 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:45:38.792 --> 03:45:42.362 region:rollup2
BALANCE OF KNOWING THAT IF THEY

03:45:40.527 --> 03:45:43.397 region:rollup2
DON'T AGREE ON A RATE THEN

03:45:42.362 --> 03:45:44.731 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THERE MAY BE OUT OF THE

03:45:43.397 --> 03:45:46.133 region:rollup2
NETWORK PATIENTS WILL STILL BE

03:45:44.731 --> 03:45:47.868 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GO THERE. BUT THEY'LL BE

03:45:46.133 --> 03:45:49.403 region:rollup2
OUT THE HOSPITAL ONLY BE PAID TO

03:45:47.868 --> 03:45:50.904 region:rollup2
MEDICARE RATE WHICH IS A

03:45:49.403 --> 03:45:51.638 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINT ON THE

03:45:50.904 --> 03:45:53.807 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATIONS.

03:45:51.638 --> 03:45:55.308 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PRICES ARE BEING SET

03:45:53.807 --> 03:45:56.810 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE PLAN IN THE HOSPITAL

03:45:55.308 --> 03:45:58.845 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE HERE RESULTS IN

03:45:56.810 --> 03:46:00.580 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT PRICES EITHER

03:45:58.845 --> 03:46:02.115 region:rollup2
COME OUT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS.

03:46:00.580 --> 03:46:02.916 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT CAN BE IMPORTANT AYE

03:46:02.115 --> 03:46:07.020 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE POINT THAT I WOULD

03:46:02.916 --> 03:46:08.755 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE FROM THIS.

03:46:07.020 --> 03:46:10.123 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S SLIDER A VERSION OF IT

03:46:08.755 --> 03:46:11.658 region:rollup2
A MINUTE AGO SHOWING AGAIN THAT

03:46:10.123 --> 03:46:13.226 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PAYMENT RATES ARE.

03:46:11.658 --> 03:46:14.528 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO MEDICARE PAY RATES A

03:46:13.226 --> 03:46:16.096 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LOWER FOR HOSPITALS

03:46:14.528 --> 03:46:18.165 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMERCIAL AS MUCH.

03:46:16.096 --> 03:46:19.332 region:rollup2
OKAY SO

03:46:18.165 --> 03:46:21.201 region:rollup2
SO A LITTLE BIT NOW AND.

03:46:19.332 --> 03:46:22.135 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF CONSOLIDATION ONE

03:46:21.201 --> 03:46:23.537 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN

03:46:22.135 --> 03:46:25.639 region:rollup2
HAPPENING RAPIDLY.

03:46:23.537 --> 03:46:26.239 region:rollup2
IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

03:46:25.639 --> 03:46:28.775 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE

03:46:26.239 --> 03:46:30.710 region:rollup2
COUNTRY AYE IS CONSOLIDATION OF

03:46:28.775 --> 03:46:32.746 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS I'VE.

03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:33.780 region:rollup2
FOCUSED HERE ON HOSPITALS AB

03:46:32.746 --> 03:46:34.281 region:rollup2
WE'LL TALK ABOUT MERGERS OF

03:46:33.780 --> 03:46:35.749 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS TO FORM LARGER

03:46:34.281 --> 03:46:37.484 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

03:46:35.749 --> 03:46:40.187 region:rollup2
OTHER FORMS OF INTEGRATION

03:46:37.484 --> 03:46:41.455 region:rollup2
BETWEEN MULTIPLE HOSPITALS TO.

03:46:40.187 --> 03:46:42.956 region:rollup2
BUT THEMSELVES IN A POSITION TO

03:46:41.455 --> 03:46:44.591 region:rollup2
WORK TOGETHER TO BARGAIN

03:46:42.956 --> 03:46:46.326 region:rollup2
TOGETHER FOR FOR THE PRICES THAT

03:46:44.591 --> 03:46:48.295 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE PAID. THIS US SLIDE

03:46:46.326 --> 03:46:48.829 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS BEEN NUMBER OF

03:46:48.295 --> 03:46:50.564 region:rollup2
MERGERS THAT THE AMERICAN

03:46:48.829 --> 03:46:51.865 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HAS

03:46:50.564 --> 03:46:53.366 region:rollup2
DETECTED OVER THE LAST.

03:46:51.865 --> 03:46:55.869 region:rollup2
QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW

03:46:53.366 --> 03:46:57.604 region:rollup2
BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT.

03:46:55.869 --> 03:46:59.172 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE GREEN

03:46:57.604 --> 03:47:00.640 region:rollup2
BARS A LOT IN MANY YEARS

03:46:59.172 --> 03:47:02.476 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE

03:47:00.640 --> 03:47:05.178 region:rollup2
COUNTRY MERGING QUITE A FEW

03:47:02.476 --> 03:47:06.079 region:rollup2
DEALS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. A

03:47:05.178 --> 03:47:07.781 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE

03:47:06.079 --> 03:47:09.216 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS IS HAPPENING IN

03:47:07.781 --> 03:47:10.784 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AS WELL I TO THE

03:47:09.216 --> 03:47:12.552 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE THERE ARE FEWER AND

03:47:10.784 --> 03:47:14.321 region:rollup2
FEWER INDEPENDENT HOSPITALS IN

03:47:12.552 --> 03:47:16.089 region:rollup2
THE STATE. MOST OF THE MARKETS

03:47:14.321 --> 03:47:18.525 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA ARE DOMINATED BY A

03:47:16.089 --> 03:47:20.594 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF LARGE SYSTEMS ARE ONE

03:47:18.525 --> 03:47:21.728 region:rollup2
OR TWO LARGE PLAYERS SOME CASES

03:47:20.594 --> 03:47:24.831 region:rollup2
THREE.

03:47:21.728 --> 03:47:25.699 region:rollup2
AND DUH THAT NORMAL METRICS

03:47:24.831 --> 03:47:27.400 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE FOR IT FOR

03:47:25.699 --> 03:47:28.635 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING HIGHLY CONCENTRATED

03:47:27.400 --> 03:47:30.270 region:rollup2
MARKETS WHICH TO

03:47:28.635 --> 03:47:31.304 region:rollup2
BUT MOST OF OUR HOSPITAL MARKETS

03:47:30.270 --> 03:47:34.541 region:rollup2
ARE CONCENTRATED. AYE IN AN

03:47:31.304 --> 03:47:36.042 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC SENSE.

03:47:34.541 --> 03:47:37.644 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION IS ALSO HAPPENING

03:47:36.042 --> 03:47:39.446 region:rollup2
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE

03:47:37.644 --> 03:47:41.148 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AS WELL PHYSICIAN

03:47:39.446 --> 03:47:42.516 region:rollup2
PRACTICES ARE GETTING LARGER.

03:47:41.148 --> 03:47:44.084 region:rollup2
AYE IN THIS IS HAPPENING TO

03:47:42.516 --> 03:47:46.419 region:rollup2
MERGERS IT'S ALSO HAPPENING

03:47:44.084 --> 03:47:47.387 region:rollup2
THROUGH NORMAL ATTRITION OF.

03:47:46.419 --> 03:47:48.855 region:rollup2
OR CHANGES IN THE THE

03:47:47.387 --> 03:47:50.190 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHICS IN THOUGH THE WORK

03:47:48.855 --> 03:47:51.858 region:rollup2
PATTERNS OF PHYSICIANS NEW

03:47:50.190 --> 03:47:53.293 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS TEND TO ENTER AND

03:47:51.858 --> 03:47:55.228 region:rollup2
JOIN LARGER PRACTICES.

03:47:53.293 --> 03:47:56.496 region:rollup2
OLDER PHYSICIANS AS THEY EXIT

03:47:55.228 --> 03:47:57.864 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE LEAVING SMALLER

03:47:56.496 --> 03:47:59.866 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND SO THAT TENDS TO

03:47:57.864 --> 03:48:01.835 region:rollup2
REINFORCE THE. DIRECTION OF THE

03:47:59.866 --> 03:48:03.603 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT AS WELL.

03:48:01.835 --> 03:48:05.205 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE SOME STATISTICS UP

03:48:03.603 --> 03:48:06.239 region:rollup2
THERE IN THAT. IN WORK THAT

03:48:05.205 --> 03:48:07.974 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE OVER THE TWO

03:48:06.239 --> 03:48:09.209 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS AND NOW INTO A TWENTY

03:48:07.974 --> 03:48:10.844 region:rollup2
FIVE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN.

03:48:09.209 --> 03:48:12.345 region:rollup2
.

03:48:10.844 --> 03:48:13.446 region:rollup2
VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN

03:48:12.345 --> 03:48:15.615 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS IN

03:48:13.446 --> 03:48:16.550 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IN THE COUNTRY AYE

03:48:15.615 --> 03:48:18.084 region:rollup2
AND PRACTICES OF MORE THAN A

03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:19.319 region:rollup2
HUNDRED. AND TO ADD TO THE POINT

03:48:18.084 --> 03:48:20.921 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S NOW THIRTY FORTY

03:48:19.319 --> 03:48:22.956 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE PHYSICIANS IN THE

03:48:20.921 --> 03:48:24.224 region:rollup2
COUNTRY ARE IN THOSE THAT THAT

03:48:22.956 --> 03:48:24.891 region:rollup2
SIZE A PRACTICE.

03:48:24.224 --> 03:48:26.226 region:rollup2
THERE'S IMMIGRATION THAT'S BEEN

03:48:24.891 --> 03:48:27.527 region:rollup2
GOING ON BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND

03:48:26.226 --> 03:48:28.862 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS SO YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT

03:48:27.527 --> 03:48:30.430 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS PURCHASING THE

03:48:28.862 --> 03:48:31.965 region:rollup2
PRACTICES OF PHYSICIANS OR

03:48:30.430 --> 03:48:33.333 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE FORMING ORGANIZATIONS

03:48:31.965 --> 03:48:36.570 region:rollup2
IN WHICH LARGE.

03:48:33.333 --> 03:48:38.371 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE TYPE PROVIDER TYPE OF

03:48:36.570 --> 03:48:40.507 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ARE FORMING.

03:48:38.371 --> 03:48:41.741 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN CONSOLIDATION OF

03:48:40.507 --> 03:48:43.376 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND PROPOSED

03:48:41.741 --> 03:48:45.111 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION SOME OF WHICH WAS

03:48:43.376 --> 03:48:46.179 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOWED BY THE COURTS BUT

03:48:45.111 --> 03:48:47.514 region:rollup2
SOME OF WHICH IS GONE THROUGH

03:48:46.179 --> 03:48:49.282 region:rollup2
OVERTIME. I TWO POINT WE HAVE

03:48:47.514 --> 03:48:50.350 region:rollup2
FEWER INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT

03:48:49.282 --> 03:48:51.685 region:rollup2
WORKING IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

03:48:50.350 --> 03:48:53.386 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

03:48:51.685 --> 03:48:55.055 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WILL EVEN LEAVE OFF

03:48:53.386 --> 03:48:56.156 region:rollup2
OTHER KINDS OF THE IMMIGRATION

03:48:55.055 --> 03:48:58.525 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING THERE ARE

03:48:56.156 --> 03:48:59.492 region:rollup2
CASES IN WHICH AYE INSURERS ARE

03:48:58.525 --> 03:49:00.026 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING WITH HEALTHCARE

03:48:59.492 --> 03:49:01.428 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

03:49:00.026 --> 03:49:03.830 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS

03:49:01.428 --> 03:49:04.898 region:rollup2
ARE VERSION OF INTEGRATION WITH

03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:06.766 region:rollup2
LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF.

03:49:04.898 --> 03:49:07.901 region:rollup2
ENTITIES OVER TYPE SO I THERE

03:49:06.766 --> 03:49:09.703 region:rollup2
QUITE A FEW VERSIONS OF

03:49:07.901 --> 03:49:11.638 region:rollup2
INTEGRATION IT'S DRIVING LARGER

03:49:09.703 --> 03:49:14.140 region:rollup2
AND LARGER ORGANIZATIONS ON THE

03:49:11.638 --> 03:49:14.708 region:rollup2
PROVIDER SIDE PARTICULARLY TO

03:49:14.140 --> 03:49:16.309 region:rollup2
SOME EXTENT ON THE INSURANCE

03:49:14.708 --> 03:49:17.143 region:rollup2
SIDE.

03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:18.445 region:rollup2
MISS AFFECT THE BARGAINING.

03:49:17.143 --> 03:49:19.045 region:rollup2
THAT DETERMINES THE PRICES THAT

03:49:18.445 --> 03:49:24.784 region:rollup2
ARE CHARGED IN THE COMMERCIAL

03:49:19.045 --> 03:49:25.852 region:rollup2
SPACE.

03:49:24.784 --> 03:49:27.320 region:rollup2
WE CAN WALK THROUGH A MINUTE ON

03:49:25.852 --> 03:49:29.356 region:rollup2
WHY THIS IS HAPPENING.

03:49:27.320 --> 03:49:29.789 region:rollup2
THREE OR FOUR THINGS COME UP.

03:49:29.356 --> 03:49:31.091 region:rollup2
.

03:49:29.789 --> 03:49:33.727 region:rollup2
LET'S SEE.

03:49:31.091 --> 03:49:35.428 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

03:49:33.727 --> 03:49:37.564 region:rollup2
ONE IS JUST SIMPLY THE TREND

03:49:35.428 --> 03:49:39.466 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A A. GLOBAL TREND

03:49:37.564 --> 03:49:40.867 region:rollup2
IF YOU WELL TOWARD CONSOLIDATION

03:49:39.466 --> 03:49:42.168 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LARGER AND LARGER

03:49:40.867 --> 03:49:44.304 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS IN MANY.

03:49:42.168 --> 03:49:45.505 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE ECONOMY IN HEALTH

03:49:44.304 --> 03:49:46.773 region:rollup2
CARE IT'S GOTTEN GOING OVER THE

03:49:45.505 --> 03:49:48.074 region:rollup2
LAST DECADE OR SO AND I THINK

03:49:46.773 --> 03:49:49.442 region:rollup2
PART OF THE TREND NOW IS JUST

03:49:48.074 --> 03:49:51.011 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE YOU'RE NOT THE LAST

03:49:49.442 --> 03:49:52.045 region:rollup2
ONE STANDING BY YOURSELF. I'VE

03:49:51.011 --> 03:49:53.546 region:rollup2
EVERYONE ELSE'S MERGING IN

03:49:52.045 --> 03:49:54.147 region:rollup2
GETTING BIGGER SO THERE'S A

03:49:53.546 --> 03:49:54.781 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TRENDING TO

03:49:54.147 --> 03:49:55.749 region:rollup2
IT.

03:49:54.781 --> 03:49:57.350 region:rollup2
AYE BUT IT'S PARTLY ALSO

03:49:55.749 --> 03:49:58.251 region:rollup2
REACTION TO POLICY PAYMENT

03:49:57.350 --> 03:50:00.987 region:rollup2
REFORMS.

03:49:58.251 --> 03:50:02.522 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL USE FOR AYE IT

03:50:00.987 --> 03:50:04.291 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

03:50:02.522 --> 03:50:06.359 region:rollup2
EYES ALL SEEM TO REWARD LARGER

03:50:04.291 --> 03:50:07.727 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT CAN MANAGE THE

03:50:06.359 --> 03:50:09.396 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY OF THESE KINDS OF

03:50:07.727 --> 03:50:10.730 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS BETTER SO SOME TO

03:50:09.396 --> 03:50:12.165 region:rollup2
SOME EXTENT BEING PUSHED BY

03:50:10.730 --> 03:50:13.266 region:rollup2
POLICY.

03:50:12.165 --> 03:50:14.267 region:rollup2
SOME EXTENT IT'S IN A ATTEMPT TO

03:50:13.266 --> 03:50:15.802 region:rollup2
IMPROVE MARKET POSITION AND A

03:50:14.267 --> 03:50:17.237 region:rollup2
GAIN OF PRICING ADVANTAGE TO

03:50:15.802 --> 03:50:18.872 region:rollup2
ENHANCE REFERRALS IF YOU HAVE A

03:50:17.237 --> 03:50:19.906 region:rollup2
BIGGER STRUCTURE YOU MAY BE IN A

03:50:18.872 --> 03:50:22.309 region:rollup2
BETTER POSITION TO SURVIVE IN

03:50:19.906 --> 03:50:23.843 region:rollup2
THE MARKETPLACE.

03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:25.211 region:rollup2
I AND I OWN I MENTION THIS

03:50:23.843 --> 03:50:25.812 region:rollup2
MINUTE AGO THERE'S I THINK IN A

03:50:25.211 --> 03:50:27.247 region:rollup2
LOT OF PARTS OF THE ECONOMY

03:50:25.812 --> 03:50:29.082 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE LARGER ORGANIZATIONS

03:50:27.247 --> 03:50:30.850 region:rollup2
AS IT AND COMMUNICATIONS AND

03:50:29.082 --> 03:50:32.085 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ABILITIES. YOU HAVE

03:50:30.850 --> 03:50:33.153 region:rollup2
EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS TO MAKE

03:50:32.085 --> 03:50:35.522 region:rollup2
IT POSSIBLE TO RUN LARGE

03:50:33.153 --> 03:50:37.190 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS MAYBE IN WAYS THAT

03:50:35.522 --> 03:50:38.291 region:rollup2
YOU COULDN'T TWENTY YEARS AGO.

03:50:37.190 --> 03:50:39.359 region:rollup2
I LEFT ONE OFF FEAR THAT I'LL

03:50:38.291 --> 03:50:40.627 region:rollup2
JUST MENTION THAT IS I THINK

03:50:39.359 --> 03:50:42.062 region:rollup2
THERE'S POSSIBILITY ALSO THAT

03:50:40.627 --> 03:50:43.096 region:rollup2
THESE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS CAN

03:50:42.062 --> 03:50:44.998 region:rollup2
HAVE QUALITY.

03:50:43.096 --> 03:50:46.366 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES IN SOME CASES THEY

03:50:44.998 --> 03:50:47.701 region:rollup2
MAY BE ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB.

03:50:46.366 --> 03:50:49.703 region:rollup2
OF.

03:50:47.701 --> 03:50:52.072 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING THE BEST TREATMENTS

03:50:49.703 --> 03:50:53.139 region:rollup2
OF DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE OF HAVING

03:50:52.072 --> 03:50:54.341 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO

03:50:53.139 --> 03:50:54.941 region:rollup2
DELIVER HIGHER QUALITY AND SO

03:50:54.341 --> 03:51:00.246 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO

03:50:54.941 --> 03:51:01.114 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION AS WELL.

03:51:00.246 --> 03:51:02.649 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET

03:51:01.114 --> 03:51:05.518 region:rollup2
THIS CONSOLIDATION.

03:51:02.649 --> 03:51:06.386 region:rollup2
FEW DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPEN.

03:51:05.518 --> 03:51:08.655 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT HAPPENS IS

03:51:06.386 --> 03:51:10.924 region:rollup2
GENERALLY HIGHER PRICES.

03:51:08.655 --> 03:51:11.925 region:rollup2
AND SO PRETTY MUCH THE ACADEMIC

03:51:10.924 --> 03:51:13.660 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT IS LOOKED AT

03:51:11.925 --> 03:51:15.395 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION SUGGEST THAT WHEN

03:51:13.660 --> 03:51:16.796 region:rollup2
YOU GET. MORE CONCENTRATED

03:51:15.395 --> 03:51:18.231 region:rollup2
MARKETS WHEN YOU GET LARGER AND

03:51:16.796 --> 03:51:19.866 region:rollup2
LARGER ENTITIES BUT

03:51:18.231 --> 03:51:21.267 region:rollup2
SPREADING IN BARGAINING AYE THEY

03:51:19.866 --> 03:51:22.869 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME MARKET POWER THAT THEY

03:51:21.267 --> 03:51:24.504 region:rollup2
CAN EXERT IN THAT BARGAINING AND

03:51:22.869 --> 03:51:26.406 region:rollup2
THEY CAN INCREASE THE PRICES

03:51:24.504 --> 03:51:28.208 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET.

03:51:26.406 --> 03:51:29.609 region:rollup2
THIS HAPPENS AT HOSPITALS.

03:51:28.208 --> 03:51:31.778 region:rollup2
PLAY HAPPENS FOR PHYSICIAN

03:51:29.609 --> 03:51:33.646 region:rollup2
GROUPS IT HAPPENS IN AND OF.

03:51:31.778 --> 03:51:35.148 region:rollup2
PRETTY BROAD VARIETY OF CONTEXT

03:51:33.646 --> 03:51:39.052 region:rollup2
AYE AND THE LITERATURE IS PRETTY

03:51:35.148 --> 03:51:40.286 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT ON THIS POINT.

03:51:39.052 --> 03:51:41.654 region:rollup2
INSURANCE BARRED INSURANCE

03:51:40.286 --> 03:51:42.856 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION ON THE OTHER HAND

03:51:41.654 --> 03:51:44.157 region:rollup2
THE COUPLE OF STUDIES THAT WE

03:51:42.856 --> 03:51:45.325 region:rollup2
HAVE SIX GOES THE OTHER

03:51:44.157 --> 03:51:46.659 region:rollup2
DIRECTION IF YOU CONSOLIDATED

03:51:45.325 --> 03:51:48.561 region:rollup2
SHARON'S COMPANIES YOU TEND TO

03:51:46.659 --> 03:51:49.195 region:rollup2
GET LOWER PRICES OF COURSE THEY.

03:51:48.561 --> 03:51:51.598 region:rollup2
BARGAIN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF

03:51:49.195 --> 03:51:52.198 region:rollup2
THE TABLE AND THEY TEND TO FORCE

03:51:51.598 --> 03:51:52.365 region:rollup2
DOWN THE PRICES THAT ARE PAID

03:51:52.198 --> 03:51:56.035 region:rollup2

DOCTORS.

03:51:56.035 --> 03:51:59.005 region:rollup2
EQUALITY EVIDENCE I WILL TELL

03:51:57.170 --> 03:52:00.340 region:rollup2
YOU IS A LITTLE BIT MIX OF

03:51:59.005 --> 03:52:00.974 region:rollup2
BENEFIT YOU STUDIES OUT THERE.

03:52:02.876 --> 03:52:04.778 region:rollup2
IT'S.

03:52:03.076 --> 03:52:06.579 region:rollup2
PROBABLY UNDER DEVELOPED IN THE

03:52:04.778 --> 03:52:08.448 region:rollup2
OVERALL SENSE BUT YOU GET SOME

03:52:06.579 --> 03:52:09.783 region:rollup2
MIXED RESULTS ON THE ONE HAND

03:52:08.448 --> 03:52:11.951 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME WELL.

03:52:09.783 --> 03:52:14.187 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED EXAMPLES OF LARGER

03:52:11.951 --> 03:52:16.122 region:rollup2

DISCOURSE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

03:52:20.493 --> 03:52:24.030 region:rollup2
BEFORE. EYES KAISER IS THAT WHEN

03:52:22.962 --> 03:52:25.865 region:rollup2
THE GETS HELD UP FROM TIME TO

TIME AS A AS A GOOD EXAMPLE.

03:52:25.865 --> 03:52:28.268 region:rollup2
NO SYSTEM IS PERFECT BUT BUT

03:52:27.667 --> 03:52:30.203 region:rollup2
THEY DO PRETTY WELL ON THEIR

03:52:28.268 --> 03:52:30.537 region:rollup2
QUALITY SQUARES THE

03:52:30.203 --> 03:52:32.472 region:rollup2

CLINIC SOME SOME OTHER EXAMPLES

03:52:35.208 --> 03:52:38.278 region:rollup2
ARE ARE OFTEN HELD UP AS CASES

03:52:36.609 --> 03:52:39.779 region:rollup2
WHERE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS CAN DO

03:52:38.278 --> 03:52:41.681 region:rollup2
BETTER.

03:52:39.779 --> 03:52:42.382 region:rollup2
THAT THE SAME TIME THE ACADEMIC

03:52:41.681 --> 03:52:44.317 region:rollup2
LITERATURE IS A IS.

03:52:42.382 --> 03:52:45.652 region:rollup2
.

03:52:44.317 --> 03:52:47.987 region:rollup2
HAS HAS I HAD A HARD TIME

03:52:45.652 --> 03:52:49.923 region:rollup2
FINDING THOSE SAME BENEFITS WHEN

03:52:47.987 --> 03:52:50.557 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT JUST THE AVERAGE RUN

03:52:49.923 --> 03:52:52.192 region:rollup2
OF THE MILL MURDER THAT YOU SEE

03:52:50.557 --> 03:52:53.760 region:rollup2
OUT THERE. SO WHEN YOU SEE

03:52:52.192 --> 03:52:55.161 region:rollup2
LARGER GROUPS FORM WHEN YOU SEE

03:52:53.760 --> 03:52:56.262 region:rollup2
MERGERS HAPPEN WHEN YOU SEE THE

03:52:55.161 --> 03:52:57.697 region:rollup2
GENERAL TRENDS THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:52:56.262 --> 03:52:59.132 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AND YOU LOOK OUTSIDE

03:52:57.697 --> 03:53:00.667 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE. THE BEST

03:52:59.132 --> 03:53:01.868 region:rollup2
PERFORMING LARGE GROUPS WE'VE

03:53:00.667 --> 03:53:03.803 region:rollup2
HAD A HARDER TIME FINDING THE

03:53:01.868 --> 03:53:05.538 region:rollup2
QUALITY ADVANTAGES COMING FROM

03:53:03.803 --> 03:53:07.307 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE MERGERS. AYE

03:53:05.538 --> 03:53:08.374 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT

03:53:07.307 --> 03:53:09.209 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN THERE NOW SOME OF THAT

03:53:08.374 --> 03:53:10.910 region:rollup2
LITERATURE IS ONLY FOLLOWED

03:53:09.209 --> 03:53:11.878 region:rollup2
THESE AND TEASE FOR A FEW YEARS

03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:13.046 region:rollup2
I AM.

03:53:11.878 --> 03:53:14.247 region:rollup2
THE LITERATURE ITSELF ISN'T AS

03:53:13.046 --> 03:53:16.115 region:rollup2
BIG AS YOU MIGHT LIKE.

03:53:14.247 --> 03:53:17.717 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE MAY BE MORE TO THE

03:53:16.115 --> 03:53:19.319 region:rollup2
STORY THAN WE KNOW AT THIS POINT

03:53:17.717 --> 03:53:20.253 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU HAD TO SUMMARIZE IT

03:53:19.319 --> 03:53:21.888 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT

03:53:20.253 --> 03:53:23.056 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION HAS HAS PUSHED

03:53:21.888 --> 03:53:24.357 region:rollup2
SEEMS HAVE PUSHED ALONG PRICE

03:53:23.056 --> 03:53:26.826 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

03:53:24.357 --> 03:53:28.328 region:rollup2
I'M BUT MAYBE NOT ALWAYS PRODUCE

03:53:26.826 --> 03:53:29.195 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY BENEFITS THAT WE

03:53:28.328 --> 03:53:30.830 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE HOPED WOULD HAVE COME

03:53:29.195 --> 03:53:31.931 region:rollup2
FROM IT ALTHOUGH THERE STILL ARE

03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:32.432 region:rollup2
SOME FOLKS WHO ARE HOPEFUL THAT

03:53:31.931 --> 03:53:36.236 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT BE OUT THERE

03:53:32.432 --> 03:53:37.570 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE.

03:53:36.236 --> 03:53:39.072 region:rollup2
DRIVERS OF HIGH COMMERCIAL

03:53:37.570 --> 03:53:40.373 region:rollup2
PRICES LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT

03:53:39.072 --> 03:53:41.674 region:rollup2
THEN ABOUT HOW WE BRING THIS

03:53:40.373 --> 03:53:42.742 region:rollup2
BACK TO PRICES IN WHAT WE MIGHT

03:53:41.674 --> 03:53:44.978 region:rollup2
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IN THIS IN

03:53:42.742 --> 03:53:46.646 region:rollup2
THE STATE CUT.

03:53:44.978 --> 03:53:48.014 region:rollup2
WHY PRICES HIGN WHERE THEY

03:53:46.646 --> 03:53:49.215 region:rollup2
GOING UP I THINK CONSOLIDATION

03:53:48.014 --> 03:53:50.917 region:rollup2
IS PART OF OUR STORY?

03:53:49.215 --> 03:53:52.552 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRENDS

03:53:50.917 --> 03:53:54.454 region:rollup2
TOWARD LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AYE

03:53:52.552 --> 03:53:54.787 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOK AT.

03:53:54.454 --> 03:53:56.823 region:rollup2
THE.

03:53:54.787 --> 03:53:58.358 region:rollup2
THE PRICE AFFECTS A GO WITH

03:53:56.823 --> 03:53:59.559 region:rollup2
THEM THIS HAS TO BE PART OF THE

03:53:58.358 --> 03:54:01.261 region:rollup2
STORY FOR GOING TO MANAGE PRICES

03:53:59.559 --> 03:54:04.063 region:rollup2
WE PROBABLY HAVE TO. HAVE A LOOK

03:54:01.261 --> 03:54:04.631 region:rollup2
AT CONSOLIDATION IN THE.

03:54:04.063 --> 03:54:05.365 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF

03:54:04.631 --> 03:54:06.799 region:rollup2
MARKET POWER.

03:54:05.365 --> 03:54:08.268 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY ON THE PART OF SOME

03:54:06.799 --> 03:54:10.136 region:rollup2
LARGE HOSPITALS EVEN IF YOU'RE

03:54:08.268 --> 03:54:10.637 region:rollup2
NOT IN A BIG SYSTEM BUT YOU ARE

03:54:10.136 --> 03:54:12.605 region:rollup2
A MUST HAVE HOSPITAL FOR

03:54:10.637 --> 03:54:14.474 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

03:54:12.605 --> 03:54:15.508 region:rollup2
AYE ANY INSURER WOULD WANT TO

03:54:14.474 --> 03:54:16.676 region:rollup2
HAVE YOUR HAVE TO HAVE YOU IN

03:54:15.508 --> 03:54:18.611 region:rollup2
THE NETWORK IN ORDER TO SELL

03:54:16.676 --> 03:54:20.446 region:rollup2
THEIR PRODUCT. YOU CAN HAVE SOME

03:54:18.611 --> 03:54:21.481 region:rollup2
MARKET POWER AND THAT'LL BE IT

03:54:20.446 --> 03:54:23.850 region:rollup2
AND IT'LL BE A UP DRIVER OF

03:54:21.481 --> 03:54:26.152 region:rollup2
PRICING.

03:54:23.850 --> 03:54:27.487 region:rollup2
OF ALL T!I COST STRUCTURES A

03:54:26.152 --> 03:54:29.055 region:rollup2
IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION.

03:54:27.487 --> 03:54:30.089 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT

03:54:29.055 --> 03:54:31.991 region:rollup2
THE STATE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY

03:54:30.089 --> 03:54:32.759 region:rollup2
HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DELIVER

03:54:31.991 --> 03:54:34.560 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

03:54:32.759 --> 03:54:36.262 region:rollup2
OFTEN VERY VALUABLE SERVICES

03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:37.697 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE WANT THAT DOCTORS

03:54:36.262 --> 03:54:39.165 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO BE PROVIDING THAT.

03:54:37.697 --> 03:54:40.233 region:rollup2
.

03:54:39.165 --> 03:54:40.800 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WOULD BE

03:54:40.233 --> 03:54:41.834 region:rollup2
DISAPPOINTED IF THEY DIDN'T

03:54:40.800 --> 03:54:43.736 region:rollup2
HAVE.

03:54:41.834 --> 03:54:45.071 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ART ARE EXPENSIVE

03:54:43.736 --> 03:54:46.639 region:rollup2
THOUGH AND CITIES PROVIDERS HAVE

03:54:45.071 --> 03:54:48.675 region:rollup2
MADE INVESTMENTS IN BUILDINGS

03:54:46.639 --> 03:54:50.176 region:rollup2
AND STAFF AND OTHER THINGS THAT

03:54:48.675 --> 03:54:51.544 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE THEIR GIVEN THEM OUT A

03:54:50.176 --> 03:54:52.946 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCT YOUR. AYE THAT CAN BE

03:54:51.544 --> 03:54:54.614 region:rollup2
QUITE EXPENSIVE AND SO THAT'S

03:54:52.946 --> 03:54:55.582 region:rollup2
PART OF IT NEGOTIATION AS WELL

03:54:54.614 --> 03:54:57.183 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO

03:54:55.582 --> 03:54:59.185 region:rollup2
CONSIDER. IF WE START TO THINK

03:54:57.183 --> 03:55:00.954 region:rollup2
ABOUT PRICES WE START TO PUSH

03:54:59.185 --> 03:55:01.955 region:rollup2
TOO MUCH I'M PRICES AYE AND YOU

03:55:00.954 --> 03:55:03.690 region:rollup2
PUSH UP AGAINST SOME OF THESE

03:55:01.955 --> 03:55:05.091 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ARE HOSPITALS THAT

03:55:03.690 --> 03:55:06.059 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE BIG INVESTMENTS. I

03:55:05.091 --> 03:55:08.294 region:rollup2
COULD PUT SOME THEM IN A

03:55:06.059 --> 03:55:09.095 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE I COULD

03:55:08.294 --> 03:55:10.496 region:rollup2
PUT COMMUNITIES IN DIFFICULT

03:55:09.095 --> 03:55:11.731 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAKES IT

03:55:10.496 --> 03:55:13.533 region:rollup2
HARDER FOR THEIR THE OTHER

03:55:11.731 --> 03:55:14.834 region:rollup2
POPULATION TO GET THE SERVICES

03:55:13.533 --> 03:55:16.636 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WANT.

03:55:14.834 --> 03:55:18.972 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO BE

03:55:16.636 --> 03:55:20.540 region:rollup2
ABLE TO. CONSTRAINED PRICE

03:55:18.972 --> 03:55:22.642 region:rollup2
INCREASES THAT ARE WARRANTED AND

03:55:20.540 --> 03:55:23.242 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE

03:55:22.642 --> 03:55:24.143 region:rollup2
COST STRUCTURES AS PART OF THE

03:55:23.242 --> 03:55:25.278 region:rollup2
STORY.

03:55:24.143 --> 03:55:27.113 region:rollup2
I OF COURSE I AS WE GO FORWARD

03:55:25.278 --> 03:55:28.081 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE HERE AND

03:55:27.113 --> 03:55:29.349 region:rollup2
AROUND THE COUNTRY WITH THE

03:55:28.081 --> 03:55:30.450 region:rollup2
ARRIVAL OF NEW AND COSTLY

03:55:29.349 --> 03:55:31.684 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS THERE ARE SOME

03:55:30.450 --> 03:55:33.252 region:rollup2
TERRIFIC THINGS THAT ARE BEING

03:55:31.684 --> 03:55:34.988 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED. AS SOME OF THEM ARE

03:55:33.252 --> 03:55:36.589 region:rollup2
PHENOMENALLY EXPENSIVE AYE SOME

03:55:34.988 --> 03:55:38.291 region:rollup2
OF THEM MAY BE PHENOMENALLY

03:55:36.589 --> 03:55:39.459 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF THAT THE

03:55:38.291 --> 03:55:41.427 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AYE THAT WE HAVE.

03:55:39.459 --> 03:55:42.629 region:rollup2
.

03:55:41.427 --> 03:55:43.563 region:rollup2
BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER THINGS

03:55:42.629 --> 03:55:44.464 region:rollup2
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THERE TOO

03:55:43.563 --> 03:55:46.866 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO

03:55:44.464 --> 03:55:49.068 region:rollup2
CONSIDER.

03:55:46.866 --> 03:55:51.037 region:rollup2
LET ME.

03:55:49.068 --> 03:55:52.605 region:rollup2
I TALK FOR A MOMENT JUST ABOUT

03:55:51.037 --> 03:55:54.907 region:rollup2
THIS UP SUFFICIENT PRESSURE FROM

03:55:52.605 --> 03:55:55.842 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

03:55:54.907 --> 03:55:57.477 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK

03:55:55.842 --> 03:55:58.011 region:rollup2
IS AS BENEFIT CHAIR OF OUR

03:55:57.477 --> 03:55:59.846 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

03:55:58.011 --> 03:56:01.781 region:rollup2
.

03:55:59.846 --> 03:56:02.749 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS

03:56:01.781 --> 03:56:04.283 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THAT HAS ALLOWED HIGH

03:56:02.749 --> 03:56:06.085 region:rollup2
PRICES TO

03:56:04.283 --> 03:56:07.320 region:rollup2
SERVES. AS THE FACT THAT THE

03:56:06.085 --> 03:56:08.554 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE MOST CONCERNED

03:56:07.320 --> 03:56:09.422 region:rollup2
ABOUT HIGH PRICES AND HIGH

03:56:08.554 --> 03:56:11.090 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SPENDING ARE PRETTY

03:56:09.422 --> 03:56:12.358 region:rollup2
DIFFUSE.

03:56:11.090 --> 03:56:13.893 region:rollup2
THEIR EMPLOYERS INVOLVED IN

03:56:12.358 --> 03:56:15.728 region:rollup2
PURCHASING HEALTH INSURANCE ARE

03:56:13.893 --> 03:56:17.330 region:rollup2
THE WORKERS ARE INVOLVED ALL OF

03:56:15.728 --> 03:56:18.431 region:rollup2
US THE POPULATION IS INVOLVED AT

03:56:17.330 --> 03:56:20.299 region:rollup2
SOME LEVEL IN PAYING FOR THAT

03:56:18.431 --> 03:56:22.535 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE.

03:56:20.299 --> 03:56:23.403 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT.

03:56:22.535 --> 03:56:25.304 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL

03:56:23.403 --> 03:56:25.838 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED INSURANCE

03:56:25.304 --> 03:56:27.874 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED.

03:56:25.838 --> 03:56:29.142 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S.

03:56:27.874 --> 03:56:30.076 region:rollup2
PRETTY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES FOR

03:56:29.142 --> 03:56:31.744 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY TO GET ON THE SAME

03:56:30.076 --> 03:56:32.912 region:rollup2
PAGE WITH WHETHER WE'RE TRYING

03:56:31.744 --> 03:56:34.247 region:rollup2
TO NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER PRICES

03:56:32.912 --> 03:56:36.215 region:rollup2
ARE WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH ON ONE

03:56:34.247 --> 03:56:38.584 region:rollup2
TYPE OF IN ONE AREA OR NOT IN

03:56:36.215 --> 03:56:41.020 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AREA. AND THIS DIFFUSE

03:56:38.584 --> 03:56:42.155 region:rollup2
SIZE SORT OF SENSE OF POWER IN

03:56:41.020 --> 03:56:43.256 region:rollup2
SOME CASES PEOPLE WHO SAY IT'S

03:56:42.155 --> 03:56:44.724 region:rollup2
NOT MY PROBLEM I DON'T KNOW HOW

03:56:43.256 --> 03:56:45.892 region:rollup2
THAT GETS DONE I'M PAYING THE

03:56:44.724 --> 03:56:48.394 region:rollup2
BILL AT SOME LEVEL BUT I HAVE NO

03:56:45.892 --> 03:56:49.829 region:rollup2
AGENCY TO GO OUT. AND TAKE THIS

03:56:48.394 --> 03:56:51.597 region:rollup2
ON IS PART OF OUR PROBLEM.

03:56:49.829 --> 03:56:53.299 region:rollup2
AND IT MAKES IT HARDER TO PUT%

03:56:51.597 --> 03:56:54.467 region:rollup2
PRESSURE ON HEALTHCARE COST

03:56:53.299 --> 03:56:55.601 region:rollup2
GROWTH WHEN WE SEE IT.

03:56:54.467 --> 03:56:56.936 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

03:56:55.601 --> 03:56:58.071 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN SO MANY

03:56:56.936 --> 03:57:00.239 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE

03:56:58.071 --> 03:57:01.074 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AND IT'S HARD FOR

03:57:00.239 --> 03:57:02.475 region:rollup2
THEM TO PUT THEIR THEIR FINGER

03:57:01.074 --> 03:57:04.243 region:rollup2
ON IT. ULTIMATELY THAT

03:57:02.475 --> 03:57:05.478 region:rollup2
POPULATION CALIFORNIA PAYS

03:57:04.243 --> 03:57:07.213 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE BILLS.

03:57:05.478 --> 03:57:09.115 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T ALWAYS KNOW HOW MY

03:57:07.213 --> 03:57:10.249 region:rollup2
MONEY'S GOING THROUGH THE SYSTEM

03:57:09.115 --> 03:57:11.751 region:rollup2
AND IT'S HARD FOR ME TO FIGURE

03:57:10.249 --> 03:57:12.552 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO BE PART OF THAT

03:57:11.751 --> 03:57:13.720 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AT SOME.

03:57:12.552 --> 03:57:15.388 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT MAKES IT MORE

03:57:13.720 --> 03:57:16.255 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT WE

03:57:15.388 --> 03:57:18.758 region:rollup2
HAVE A WORLD IN WHICH WE'RE

03:57:16.255 --> 03:57:19.792 region:rollup2
BALANCING THE VALUE THAT WERE

03:57:18.758 --> 03:57:20.026 region:rollup2
GETTING THE PRICE THAT WERE

03:57:19.792 --> 03:57:21.227 region:rollup2
PAYING.

03:57:20.026 --> 03:57:22.628 region:rollup2
IF SO MANY THAT SO MANY

03:57:21.227 --> 03:57:23.763 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH SO MANY

03:57:22.628 --> 03:57:26.132 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES.

03:57:23.763 --> 03:57:27.366 region:rollup2
IMP INCOMPLETE IDEAS ABOUT HOW

03:57:26.132 --> 03:57:30.536 region:rollup2
THE MONEY IS FLOWING ARE PART OF

03:57:27.366 --> 03:57:31.404 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION.

03:57:30.536 --> 03:57:33.272 region:rollup2
OKAY SYSTEM POLICY

03:57:31.404 --> 03:57:34.941 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS TO FINISH UP

03:57:33.272 --> 03:57:37.076 region:rollup2
THESE ARE BASICALLY OF TO START

03:57:34.941 --> 03:57:38.444 region:rollup2
IN THE CONTEXT OF A SYSTEM IN

03:57:37.076 --> 03:57:39.412 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD WHICH WE MAINTAIN

03:57:38.444 --> 03:57:40.646 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FEATURES OF OUR

03:57:39.412 --> 03:57:42.248 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM BUT WHAT COULD A

03:57:40.646 --> 03:57:43.683 region:rollup2
STATE DO. TO TRY AND MAKE THE

03:57:42.248 --> 03:57:45.218 region:rollup2
BARGAINING WORKED OUT BETTER IF

03:57:43.683 --> 03:57:46.352 region:rollup2
YOU WILL SO WE GET CLOSER TO

03:57:45.218 --> 03:57:48.154 region:rollup2
PRICES THAT WE CAN.

03:57:46.352 --> 03:57:49.355 region:rollup2
VIEW AS REFLECTING THE VALUE

03:57:48.154 --> 03:57:50.756 region:rollup2
THAT WE LIKE TO BE GETTING FROM

03:57:49.355 --> 03:57:52.058 region:rollup2
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

03:57:50.756 --> 03:57:53.659 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THING IS MANAGING

03:57:52.058 --> 03:57:56.095 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION AYE WE'VE HAD A

03:57:53.659 --> 03:57:56.929 region:rollup2
TREND TOWARD IT THERE MIGHT I

03:57:56.095 --> 03:57:57.597 region:rollup2
CAN ONLY IMAGINE THERE WILL BE

03:57:56.929 --> 03:57:58.865 region:rollup2
MORE.

03:57:57.597 --> 03:58:00.299 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE

03:57:58.865 --> 03:58:02.235 region:rollup2
FOR A STATE TO TAKE AN INTEREST

03:58:00.299 --> 03:58:04.237 region:rollup2
IN THE THE STRUCTURE OF ITS

03:58:02.235 --> 03:58:05.938 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE MARKETS AND TO TAKE

03:58:04.237 --> 03:58:07.306 region:rollup2
IT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. I WOULD

03:58:05.938 --> 03:58:09.475 region:rollup2
HAVE TO A COURSE INTERACT WITH

03:58:07.306 --> 03:58:10.910 region:rollup2
FEDERAL EFFORTS THE FTC OF THE

03:58:09.475 --> 03:58:12.445 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALSO TAKE

03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:14.113 region:rollup2
AN INTEREST IN MERGERS.

03:58:12.445 --> 03:58:15.748 region:rollup2
AN ANTITRUST POLICY.

03:58:14.113 --> 03:58:16.482 region:rollup2
BUT THESE THINGS AFFECT STATES

03:58:15.748 --> 03:58:17.750 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL

03:58:16.482 --> 03:58:19.252 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:20.920 region:rollup2
THE STATE WOULD WANNA MONITOR

03:58:19.252 --> 03:58:22.155 region:rollup2
ITS MARKETS AND DECIDE IF THERE

03:58:20.920 --> 03:58:23.589 region:rollup2
WERE ACTIONS IT WOULD WANT TO

03:58:22.155 --> 03:58:24.791 region:rollup2
TAKE I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

03:58:23.589 --> 03:58:26.659 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO KNOW

03:58:24.791 --> 03:58:28.027 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT BUT THERE

03:58:26.659 --> 03:58:30.229 region:rollup2
ARE METRICS THAT EXISTS THERE

03:58:28.027 --> 03:58:31.364 region:rollup2
ARE. AYE DEATH HIRSCHMAN HER

03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:33.533 region:rollup2
FROM DAHLE INDEX BOTHER R.

03:58:31.364 --> 03:58:35.635 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION YOU KNOW WE CAN

03:58:33.533 --> 03:58:38.704 region:rollup2
TALK LONGER ABOUT THESE IF YOU

03:58:35.635 --> 03:58:40.206 region:rollup2
WANT TO. CONFIRM MY CLASS

03:58:38.704 --> 03:58:41.407 region:rollup2
SOMETIME WE'LL TALK ABOUT OF A

03:58:40.206 --> 03:58:43.943 region:rollup2
TAIL.

03:58:41.407 --> 03:58:46.145 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BUT THERE ARE THINGS

03:58:43.943 --> 03:58:48.381 region:rollup2
YOU CAN DO THERE ARE TOOLS YOU

03:58:46.145 --> 03:58:50.716 region:rollup2
CAN USE IN WAYS YOU CAN TAKE A

03:58:48.381 --> 03:58:54.353 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE US AND THAT MAY BE

03:58:50.716 --> 03:58:54.987 region:rollup2
THAT STATE EFFORTS TO REVIEW

03:58:54.353 --> 03:58:55.721 region:rollup2
MERGERS MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE AND

03:58:54.987 --> 03:58:56.956 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP.

03:58:55.721 --> 03:58:58.257 region:rollup2
I THINK IMPROVING THE CONTEXT

03:58:56.956 --> 03:58:59.125 region:rollup2
FOR ENSURE BARGAINING IS IS

03:58:58.257 --> 03:59:00.326 region:rollup2
HELPFUL SO THERE ARE INSURANCE

03:58:59.125 --> 03:59:01.494 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT DO TRY AYE TO

03:59:00.326 --> 03:59:02.562 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE RATES WITH PROVIDERS

03:59:01.494 --> 03:59:03.596 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES. IT'S HARDER FOR

03:59:02.562 --> 03:59:04.363 region:rollup2
THEM THAN IT NEEDS TO BE SO IT

03:59:03.596 --> 03:59:06.199 region:rollup2
MAY BE THAT WE CAN GET SOME

03:59:04.363 --> 03:59:07.200 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE THERE. I'LL POINT OUT

03:59:06.199 --> 03:59:08.768 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS I'M

03:59:07.200 --> 03:59:09.869 region:rollup2
JUST A THING TO KEEP IN MIND ONE

03:59:08.768 --> 03:59:10.770 region:rollup2
OF THE INTERESTING TRADEOFFS IS

03:59:09.869 --> 03:59:12.538 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES

03:59:10.770 --> 03:59:13.873 region:rollup2
TODAY IS BETWEEN NETWORK

03:59:12.538 --> 03:59:16.042 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE. AYE AND AND

03:59:13.873 --> 03:59:17.877 region:rollup2
BARGAINING ABILITY SO I DOCTOR

03:59:16.042 --> 03:59:19.178 region:rollup2
GRAVES POINTED OUT I THINK

03:59:17.877 --> 03:59:20.346 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THAT.

03:59:19.178 --> 03:59:22.315 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE NARROW NETWORKS AND

03:59:20.346 --> 03:59:23.382 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED NETWORKS IT CAN BE

03:59:22.315 --> 03:59:24.650 region:rollup2
HARD FOR PATIENTS.

03:59:23.382 --> 03:59:26.018 region:rollup2
I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT IS

03:59:24.650 --> 03:59:27.620 region:rollup2
INTERESTING ONE OF THINGS THAT

03:59:26.018 --> 03:59:28.688 region:rollup2
IS INTERESTING THOUGH IS THAT

03:59:27.620 --> 03:59:30.656 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF AN INSURANCE

03:59:28.688 --> 03:59:31.824 region:rollup2
COMPANY TACTIC A HOSPITAL OUT OF

03:59:30.656 --> 03:59:33.492 region:rollup2
THE NETWORK IF THEY DON'T COME

03:59:31.824 --> 03:59:34.660 region:rollup2
UP WITH A REASONABLE PRICE. IS

03:59:33.492 --> 03:59:36.596 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF

03:59:34.660 --> 03:59:38.331 region:rollup2
BARGAINING AND SO EFFORTS TO SAY

03:59:36.596 --> 03:59:40.333 region:rollup2
SYSTEMATICALLY SAY EVERY

03:59:38.331 --> 03:59:41.934 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL HAS TO BE IN A NETWORK.

03:59:40.333 --> 03:59:42.902 region:rollup2
I WOULD PUT TREMENDOUS POWER IN

03:59:41.934 --> 03:59:44.604 region:rollup2
THE HANDS OF THE HOSPITAL WHEN

03:59:42.902 --> 03:59:46.038 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD GO TO NEGOTIATE WHAT

03:59:44.604 --> 03:59:46.505 region:rollup2
THEIR RATES ARE GOING TO BE. ON

03:59:46.038 --> 03:59:48.441 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

03:59:46.505 --> 03:59:49.442 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU SET THOSE

03:59:48.441 --> 03:59:51.110 region:rollup2
KINDS OF POLICIES THERE'S

03:59:49.442 --> 03:59:52.445 region:rollup2
CLEARLY ARE CLEARLY TRADE OFFS

03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:54.180 region:rollup2
ON BOTH SIDES BUT WE DON'T WANT

03:59:52.445 --> 03:59:55.781 region:rollup2
TO GO TOO FAR ONE WAY OR THE

03:59:54.180 --> 03:59:56.749 region:rollup2
OTHER WE MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE.

03:59:55.781 --> 03:59:58.784 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING I'LL JUST POINT

03:59:56.749 --> 03:59:59.785 region:rollup2
OUT IS THAT LIMITATIONS ON OUT

03:59:58.784 --> 04:00:01.420 region:rollup2
OF NETWORK PRICES CAN HAVE

03:59:59.785 --> 04:00:03.322 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT EFFECTS AS WE SAW WITH

04:00:01.420 --> 04:00:04.090 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. I KNOW THE

04:00:03.322 --> 04:00:06.125 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS.

04:00:04.090 --> 04:00:07.927 region:rollup2
MADE SOME EFFORTS TO THINK

04:00:06.125 --> 04:00:09.228 region:rollup2
ABOUT OUT OF NETWORK PRICING AYE

04:00:07.927 --> 04:00:10.496 region:rollup2
AND I'LL SIMPLY SAY THAT THOSE

04:00:09.228 --> 04:00:12.465 region:rollup2
CAN BE.

04:00:10.496 --> 04:00:14.400 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AYE AND MAY BE VERY

04:00:12.465 --> 04:00:16.135 region:rollup2
VERY USEFUL AND MANAGING PRICE

04:00:14.400 --> 04:00:17.536 region:rollup2
GROWTH A BECAUSE THEY AFFECT THE

04:00:16.135 --> 04:00:19.372 region:rollup2
BARGAINING THAT GOES ON A

04:00:17.536 --> 04:00:22.108 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PLANS. AND SO THAT

04:00:19.372 --> 04:00:23.476 region:rollup2
MAY BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

04:00:22.108 --> 04:00:25.177 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF

04:00:23.476 --> 04:00:26.946 region:rollup2
INSURANCE I THINK IS ANOTHER WAY

04:00:25.177 --> 04:00:28.381 region:rollup2
TO TO STRENGTHEN THE HAND OF

04:00:26.946 --> 04:00:29.782 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE NEGOTIATING FOR

04:00:28.381 --> 04:00:30.883 region:rollup2
REASONABLE RATES. ARE COVERED

04:00:29.782 --> 04:00:31.550 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN VERY

04:00:30.883 --> 04:00:33.519 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:35.121 region:rollup2
AS A MARKETPLACE AND

04:00:33.519 --> 04:00:36.656 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING THE USE OF THAT TO

04:00:35.121 --> 04:00:37.990 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT THAT THAT STATE

04:00:36.656 --> 04:00:38.724 region:rollup2
POLICY CAN HELP THAT GROW AND

04:00:37.990 --> 04:00:40.359 region:rollup2
FLOURISH.

04:00:38.724 --> 04:00:42.128 region:rollup2
I THINK WOULD.

04:00:40.359 --> 04:00:43.296 region:rollup2
ALSO PUT MORE POWER IN THE HANDS

04:00:42.128 --> 04:00:43.896 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NEGOTIATING

04:00:43.296 --> 04:00:45.431 region:rollup2
RATES AND ALLOW SOME PRESSURE

04:00:43.896 --> 04:00:48.000 region:rollup2
TO.

04:00:45.431 --> 04:00:49.368 region:rollup2
BROUGHT TO.

04:00:48.000 --> 04:00:50.703 region:rollup2
I'LL KNOW THAT ENCOURAGING

04:00:49.368 --> 04:00:52.872 region:rollup2
PRICE TRANSPARENCY IS PROBABLY

04:00:50.703 --> 04:00:54.040 region:rollup2
PART OF OUR STORY I'D VERY HARD

04:00:52.872 --> 04:00:55.174 region:rollup2
AS YOU ALL KNOW TO SEE THE

04:00:54.040 --> 04:00:56.542 region:rollup2
PRICES FOR

04:00:55.174 --> 04:00:57.877 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

04:00:56.542 --> 04:00:59.278 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW CALIFORNIA'S I'D SAID

04:00:57.877 --> 04:01:01.314 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST DISCUSSIONS NOW

04:00:59.278 --> 04:01:01.747 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS AND I ENCOURAGE.

04:01:01.314 --> 04:01:04.250 region:rollup2
THOSE.

04:01:01.747 --> 04:01:06.986 region:rollup2
I WILL JUST OFFER THE CABBIE

04:01:04.250 --> 04:01:08.454 region:rollup2
OUT THAT ONCE IN AWHILE I'M.

04:01:06.986 --> 04:01:10.156 region:rollup2
SO SOMETIMES WE CALL THIS THE C.

04:01:08.454 --> 04:01:11.624 region:rollup2
E. O. PROBLEM AND AND THEIR

04:01:10.156 --> 04:01:12.925 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS WORLD WHERE.

04:01:11.624 --> 04:01:15.127 region:rollup2
PUBLICATION OF ALL THE CEO

04:01:12.925 --> 04:01:16.896 region:rollup2
SALARIES DID NOT MAKE THEM GO

04:01:15.127 --> 04:01:17.997 region:rollup2
DOWN AYE IT MADE HIM GO UP WHEN

04:01:16.896 --> 04:01:19.298 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE

04:01:17.997 --> 04:01:20.833 region:rollup2
PILE FIGURED OUT WHAT THEY COULD

04:01:19.298 --> 04:01:22.435 region:rollup2
BE GETTING IF ONLY THEY DID A

04:01:20.833 --> 04:01:23.869 region:rollup2
BETTER JOB OF NEGOTIATING.

04:01:22.435 --> 04:01:24.870 region:rollup2
RIGHTED SO JUST SIMPLY

04:01:23.869 --> 04:01:25.938 region:rollup2
PUBLISHING ALL THE PRICES IN

04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:27.473 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

04:01:25.938 --> 04:01:28.975 region:rollup2
MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT MAKE THEM GO

04:01:27.473 --> 04:01:30.376 region:rollup2
DOWN IT MIGHT JUST YEAH I INFORM

04:01:28.975 --> 04:01:31.644 region:rollup2
ALL THE PEOPLE GETTING LESS THAT

04:01:30.376 --> 04:01:33.312 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE SHOULD BE TRYING

04:01:31.644 --> 04:01:35.114 region:rollup2
TO GET MORE. YOU HAVE TO PUBLISH

04:01:33.312 --> 04:01:36.449 region:rollup2
THE PRICES IN THE CONTEXT OF A

04:01:35.114 --> 04:01:37.950 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS THE

04:01:36.449 --> 04:01:39.652 region:rollup2
DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BE BROUGHT

04:01:37.950 --> 04:01:42.355 region:rollup2
TO BEAR TO USE THAT TO TRY TO

04:01:39.652 --> 04:01:43.356 region:rollup2
DRIVE DOWN PRICES.

04:01:42.355 --> 04:01:44.156 region:rollup2
AND I COME UP TO PRICE

04:01:43.356 --> 04:01:45.324 region:rollup2
REGULATION WHEN I JUST TALKED

04:01:44.156 --> 04:01:46.959 region:rollup2
ABOUT ARE THINGS THAT YOU COULD

04:01:45.324 --> 04:01:49.161 region:rollup2
TRY THAT MIGHT HELP IN THE

04:01:46.959 --> 04:01:51.030 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF A THE THE SITUATION

04:01:49.161 --> 04:01:53.165 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE IN NOW. AYE IT MAY

04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:54.333 region:rollup2
BE THAT THOSE ARE INSUFFICIENT

04:01:53.165 --> 04:01:56.168 region:rollup2
TO IF MARKETS ARE TO

04:01:54.333 --> 04:01:57.570 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATED THE HORSES OUT OF

04:01:56.168 --> 04:01:59.205 region:rollup2
THE BARN IF THERE ARE OTHER

04:01:57.570 --> 04:02:00.506 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT WE. ARE GOING TO

04:01:59.205 --> 04:02:02.174 region:rollup2
HAVE A HARD TIME MANAGING IT AYE

04:02:00.506 --> 04:02:03.776 region:rollup2
WE MAY GET TO SOME A SITUATION

04:02:02.174 --> 04:02:05.077 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WANT TO. TALK ABOUT

04:02:03.776 --> 04:02:06.579 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT DOCTOR TRISH WAS

04:02:05.077 --> 04:02:07.980 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO MANAGE

04:02:06.579 --> 04:02:09.648 region:rollup2
OUR PRICE STRUCTURE A LITTLE

04:02:07.980 --> 04:02:12.885 region:rollup2
MORE AGGRESSIVELY. I'M I THINK

04:02:09.648 --> 04:02:13.686 region:rollup2
THAT UP FOR ME COMES MAYBE I'M.

04:02:12.885 --> 04:02:14.520 region:rollup2
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE

04:02:13.686 --> 04:02:15.821 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING.

04:02:14.520 --> 04:02:17.056 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WOULD BE POLITICALLY

04:02:15.821 --> 04:02:18.224 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING IN THERE'D HAVE TO

04:02:17.056 --> 04:02:19.692 region:rollup2
BE DISCUSSIONS WITH HEALTHCARE

04:02:18.224 --> 04:02:21.327 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS BUT SOMETHING LIKE THE

04:02:19.692 --> 04:02:22.862 region:rollup2
MARYLAND MODEL DOES OFFER AN

04:02:21.327 --> 04:02:24.697 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW

04:02:22.862 --> 04:02:26.065 region:rollup2
YOU DO THAT. AND MAYBE MOVING IN

04:02:24.697 --> 04:02:30.035 region:rollup2
THAT DIRECTION IS ULTIMATELY

04:02:26.065 --> 04:02:31.270 region:rollup2
WHERE WE NEED TO GET TO GO SO I.

04:02:30.035 --> 04:02:31.904 region:rollup2
I'LL SUGGEST THAT I THINK THAT

04:02:31.270 --> 04:02:34.306 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE AN IMPORTANT THING

04:02:31.904 --> 04:02:36.509 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT. I'M.

04:02:34.306 --> 04:02:38.043 region:rollup2
WRAPPING UP.

04:02:36.509 --> 04:02:40.179 region:rollup2
MAYBE I JUST NOTICED THAT YOU

04:02:38.043 --> 04:02:40.713 region:rollup2
ARE OFF QUITE FAMILIAR IT SOUNDS

04:02:40.179 --> 04:02:41.814 region:rollup2
ABOUT SUBSIDY ABOUT THESE

04:02:40.713 --> 04:02:43.783 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

04:02:41.814 --> 04:02:44.417 region:rollup2
AYE RURAL AREAS MAY NEED SPECIAL

04:02:43.783 --> 04:02:45.818 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION IN THESE KINDS OF

04:02:44.417 --> 04:02:47.787 region:rollup2
DISK.

04:02:45.818 --> 04:02:49.488 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE ECONOMIC THEORIES

04:02:47.787 --> 04:02:52.525 region:rollup2
IN THE ECONOMIC IDEAS PRESUME

04:02:49.488 --> 04:02:53.526 region:rollup2
SOME NOTION SOMEPLACE OF FOUR

04:02:52.525 --> 04:02:54.927 region:rollup2
OUT FOR BARGAINING IN

04:02:53.526 --> 04:02:57.029 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATION AND THAT PRESUMES

04:02:54.927 --> 04:02:58.497 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE.

04:02:57.029 --> 04:02:59.665 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN TALK TO AND IF YOU

04:02:58.497 --> 04:03:01.133 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT IN AN AREA.

04:02:59.665 --> 04:03:02.468 region:rollup2
.

04:03:01.133 --> 04:03:04.103 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE WON'T WORK AS WELL

04:03:02.468 --> 04:03:05.738 region:rollup2
AYE AND IF YOU TOOK DRAMATIC

04:03:04.103 --> 04:03:07.273 region:rollup2
ACTION IN A CLOSED HOSPITALS IN

04:03:05.738 --> 04:03:08.541 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS AND TOOK ACCESS AWAY

04:03:07.273 --> 04:03:09.975 region:rollup2
FROM PEOPLE THAT COULD BE A REAL

04:03:08.541 --> 04:03:11.143 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AS WELL AND SO IT MAY.

04:03:09.975 --> 04:03:12.678 region:rollup2
BE THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE

04:03:11.143 --> 04:03:14.613 region:rollup2
UNIQUE CONSIDERATIONS ARE

04:03:12.678 --> 04:03:16.348 region:rollup2
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION GIVEN. TO

04:03:14.613 --> 04:03:18.284 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS AND ANY EFFORT TO

04:03:16.348 --> 04:03:19.718 region:rollup2
MANAGE PRICES I'D MIGHT BE THAT

04:03:18.284 --> 04:03:21.654 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO SYSTEMS IN SOME

04:03:19.718 --> 04:03:23.989 region:rollup2
SENSE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

04:03:21.654 --> 04:03:25.825 region:rollup2
DIDN'T DO DAMAGE IN THOSE AREAS.

04:03:23.989 --> 04:03:27.426 region:rollup2
AND I'LL JUST WRAP UP THEN BY

04:03:25.825 --> 04:03:29.028 region:rollup2
MAKING ONE MORE POINT IN THAT IS

04:03:27.426 --> 04:03:30.896 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT I HAVE TALKED A LOT

04:03:29.028 --> 04:03:31.630 region:rollup2
ABOUT PRICES AND THINGS THAT YOU

04:03:30.896 --> 04:03:34.266 region:rollup2
TO DO FOR PRICES.

04:03:31.630 --> 04:03:35.468 region:rollup2
I SPENT A LOT OF MY OWN TIME

04:03:34.266 --> 04:03:37.036 region:rollup2
RESEARCHING THESE ISSUES AND SO

04:03:35.468 --> 04:03:38.938 region:rollup2
I THINK PRICES ARE PARDONED FOR

04:03:37.036 --> 04:03:40.806 region:rollup2
PRICES SAKE. BUT WE SHOULDN'T

04:03:38.938 --> 04:03:43.142 region:rollup2
STOP THERE BECAUSE MANAGING OUR

04:03:40.806 --> 04:03:44.710 region:rollup2
PRICES HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW

04:03:43.142 --> 04:03:46.112 region:rollup2
WE RUN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND

04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:47.613 region:rollup2
FOR THE ACCESS THAT WE CAN MAKE

04:03:46.112 --> 04:03:49.215 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AROUND THE

04:03:47.613 --> 04:03:50.883 region:rollup2
STATE. FOR THE LONG TERM

04:03:49.215 --> 04:03:52.284 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY OF A YOU KNOW THE

04:03:50.883 --> 04:03:53.853 region:rollup2
FINANCING SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE

04:03:52.284 --> 04:03:55.721 region:rollup2
AND SO. AS I THINK THIS IS

04:03:53.853 --> 04:03:57.056 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR MANY REASONS AND

04:03:55.721 --> 04:03:57.957 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GETTING A HANDLE ON

04:03:57.056 --> 04:03:59.558 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE HIGH AND RISING

04:03:57.957 --> 04:04:01.227 region:rollup2
PRICES WOULD ALLOW.

04:03:59.558 --> 04:04:02.795 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO

04:04:01.227 --> 04:04:04.330 region:rollup2
GO FORWARD MORE EASILY IT WOULD

04:04:02.795 --> 04:04:06.065 region:rollup2
HAVE OTHER IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES

04:04:04.330 --> 04:04:06.632 region:rollup2
AND SO FROM A. BROADER

04:04:06.065 --> 04:04:07.132 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE IT'S IMPORTANT I

04:04:06.632 --> 04:04:10.269 region:rollup2
THINK.

04:04:07.132 --> 04:04:12.938 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:04:10.269 --> 04:04:13.539 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND

04:04:12.938 --> 04:04:15.441 region:rollup2
NEXT WE HAVE PLAY REAL OF THE

04:04:13.539 --> 04:04:16.742 region:rollup2
CAN THINK.

04:04:15.441 --> 04:04:17.409 region:rollup2
THANKS AGAIN TO THAT TO THE

04:04:16.742 --> 04:04:19.545 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

04:04:17.409 --> 04:04:21.680 region:rollup2
AYE AYE I'M WELL AWARE THAT I

04:04:19.545 --> 04:04:23.549 region:rollup2
STAND BETWEEN YOU AND PUBLIC

04:04:21.680 --> 04:04:24.283 region:rollup2
COMMENTS I PROMISE TO BE. TO BE

04:04:23.549 --> 04:04:25.384 region:rollup2
BRIEF.

04:04:24.283 --> 04:04:25.684 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT IS CERTAINLY

04:04:25.384 --> 04:04:27.253 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

04:04:25.684 --> 04:04:29.555 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

04:04:27.253 --> 04:04:30.556 region:rollup2
AS IT SLIDES ARE BEING.

04:04:29.555 --> 04:04:32.024 region:rollup2
SET UP.

04:04:30.556 --> 04:04:34.493 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT.

04:04:32.024 --> 04:04:35.995 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN IN THE

04:04:34.493 --> 04:04:37.530 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

04:04:35.995 --> 04:04:39.064 region:rollup2
AND THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT

04:04:37.530 --> 04:04:40.866 region:rollup2
THE DRIVING FORCE OF OF HEALTH

04:04:39.064 --> 04:04:42.668 region:rollup2
CARE REFORM. AND IT PALES IN

04:04:40.866 --> 04:04:44.336 region:rollup2
COMPARISON TO THE OVERALL EFFORT

04:04:42.668 --> 04:04:46.338 region:rollup2
TO GET MORE AFFORDABLE COVERAGE.

04:04:44.336 --> 04:04:47.640 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO MORE PEOPLE.

04:04:46.338 --> 04:04:48.741 region:rollup2
AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T SEE A

04:04:47.640 --> 04:04:50.709 region:rollup2
LOT ABOUT FIRST OCCURS AROUND

04:04:48.741 --> 04:04:51.544 region:rollup2
SAYING REDUCE HEALTHCARE

04:04:50.709 --> 04:04:52.945 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS NOW.

04:04:51.544 --> 04:04:53.145 region:rollup2
.

04:04:52.945 --> 04:04:56.015 region:rollup2
BUT.

04:04:53.145 --> 04:04:58.184 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS POTENTIALLY A WAY TO.

04:04:56.015 --> 04:04:58.951 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY IN THE

04:04:58.184 --> 04:05:00.819 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:04:58.951 --> 04:05:02.788 region:rollup2
AND ALSO I THINK AS AS LAWRENCE

04:05:00.819 --> 04:05:04.156 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED FREE UP RESOURCES.

04:05:02.788 --> 04:05:05.391 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND COVERAGE.

04:05:04.156 --> 04:05:06.392 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT ADMINISTRATIVE

04:05:05.391 --> 04:05:08.494 region:rollup2
COSTS.

04:05:06.392 --> 04:05:10.129 region:rollup2
REPRESENT WASTE IN A SENSE IF

04:05:08.494 --> 04:05:10.930 region:rollup2
WE CAN REDUCE THAT WASTE.

04:05:10.129 --> 04:05:12.064 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAVE MORE MONEY

04:05:10.930 --> 04:05:13.332 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

04:05:12.064 --> 04:05:15.701 region:rollup2
TO TO COVER PEOPLE.

04:05:13.332 --> 04:05:17.202 region:rollup2
.

04:05:15.701 --> 04:05:18.871 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO LOOK

04:05:17.202 --> 04:05:20.406 region:rollup2
AT WHAT WE THINK OF AS AS

04:05:18.871 --> 04:05:21.740 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND AND I

04:05:20.406 --> 04:05:22.641 region:rollup2
THINK THE WAY TO A THINK ABOUT

04:05:21.740 --> 04:05:23.709 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT.

04:05:22.641 --> 04:05:25.144 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE

04:05:23.709 --> 04:05:26.812 region:rollup2
BASICALLY EVERYTHING WE SPEND IN

04:05:25.144 --> 04:05:28.480 region:rollup2
THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

04:05:26.812 --> 04:05:30.583 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT PATIENT CARE.

04:05:28.480 --> 04:05:31.617 region:rollup2
SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS

04:05:30.583 --> 04:05:32.384 region:rollup2
IS IT'S KIND OF WHAT WE SPEND

04:05:31.617 --> 04:05:33.752 region:rollup2
FOR.

04:05:32.384 --> 04:05:35.287 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WEARING SUITS.

04:05:33.752 --> 04:05:36.155 region:rollup2
FOR MEN AND WOMEN WEARING SUITS

04:05:35.287 --> 04:05:37.623 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN MEN AND WOMEN

04:05:36.155 --> 04:05:39.191 region:rollup2
WEARING A WHITE COATS OR OR

04:05:37.623 --> 04:05:40.893 region:rollup2
SCRUBS.

04:05:39.191 --> 04:05:41.360 region:rollup2
AND IF HE'S GOING TO GO DOWN

04:05:40.893 --> 04:05:42.728 region:rollup2
THE LIST OF WHAT THIS

04:05:41.360 --> 04:05:44.229 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS.

04:05:42.728 --> 04:05:46.131 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY PROFIT.

04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:47.366 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW MUCH OF OUR

04:05:46.131 --> 04:05:49.835 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS.

04:05:47.366 --> 04:05:51.904 region:rollup2
IT RUNS ON PROFIT.

04:05:49.835 --> 04:05:53.439 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY HOSPITALS BUT

04:05:51.904 --> 04:05:55.674 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY PHYSICIAN GROUPS.

04:05:53.439 --> 04:05:57.509 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY MOST OF OUR

04:05:55.674 --> 04:06:00.012 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURERS AS WELL.

04:05:57.509 --> 04:06:01.080 region:rollup2
THINK WE FOCUS A LOT ON SORT OF

04:06:00.012 --> 04:06:02.715 region:rollup2
THE INSURANCE ASPECTS OF

04:06:01.080 --> 04:06:05.284 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION SO THAT'S THINGS

04:06:02.715 --> 04:06:07.353 region:rollup2
LIKE BILLING. CLAIMS PAYMENT.

04:06:05.284 --> 04:06:08.087 region:rollup2
AND OTHER INSURANCE RELATED

04:06:07.353 --> 04:06:10.122 region:rollup2
COSTS.

04:06:08.087 --> 04:06:11.957 region:rollup2
THERE CERTAINLY IN A

04:06:10.122 --> 04:06:13.025 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL SYSTEM A

04:06:11.957 --> 04:06:15.160 region:rollup2
LOT OF MARKETING.

04:06:13.025 --> 04:06:17.263 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT JUST INSURERS IT

04:06:15.160 --> 04:06:18.931 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HOSPITALS AND

04:06:17.263 --> 04:06:21.166 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN GROUPS AS WELL.

04:06:18.931 --> 04:06:22.301 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS PARTS OF OF THE

04:06:21.166 --> 04:06:24.003 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT I

04:06:22.301 --> 04:06:25.571 region:rollup2
THINK WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY.

04:06:24.003 --> 04:06:27.940 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE

04:06:25.571 --> 04:06:30.142 region:rollup2
THINK OF AS AS KIND OF WASTE.

04:06:27.940 --> 04:06:32.144 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S CARE MANAGEMENT AND

04:06:30.142 --> 04:06:32.978 region:rollup2
CLINICAL ADMINISTRATION I MEAN

04:06:32.144 --> 04:06:35.180 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOSPITALS INSURANCE

04:06:32.978 --> 04:06:36.348 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE BIG ORGANIZATIONS

04:06:35.180 --> 04:06:38.117 region:rollup2
AND IT REQUIRES SOME AMOUNT OF

04:06:36.348 --> 04:06:39.652 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO TO MAKE THEM

04:06:38.117 --> 04:06:41.186 region:rollup2
FUNCTION.

04:06:39.652 --> 04:06:42.955 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT

04:06:41.186 --> 04:06:44.123 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT SECTORS OF OF

04:06:42.955 --> 04:06:45.724 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE AND HEALTH

04:06:44.123 --> 04:06:46.659 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN CHURN AMONG THOSE

04:06:45.724 --> 04:06:47.760 region:rollup2
SECTORS.

04:06:46.659 --> 04:06:49.161 region:rollup2
AND SORT OF DETERMINING

04:06:47.760 --> 04:06:50.262 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY AND MANAGING THE

04:06:49.161 --> 04:06:51.530 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

04:06:50.262 --> 04:06:53.299 region:rollup2
IS.

04:06:51.530 --> 04:06:54.566 region:rollup2
IF YOU TO PRINT REQUIRES

04:06:53.299 --> 04:06:56.101 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND

04:06:54.566 --> 04:06:57.903 region:rollup2
INDUCTANCE DEVEN INCLUDE THINGS

04:06:56.101 --> 04:06:59.638 region:rollup2
LIKE AYE HR DEPARTMENTS IN

04:06:57.903 --> 04:07:00.606 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE TO MANAGE

04:06:59.638 --> 04:07:02.141 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH BENEFITS.

04:07:00.606 --> 04:07:03.842 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR WORKERS.

04:07:02.141 --> 04:07:04.576 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE IS THE THE

04:07:03.842 --> 04:07:06.178 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

04:07:04.576 --> 04:07:07.780 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION YOU

04:07:06.178 --> 04:07:09.548 region:rollup2
KNOW RUNNING MEDICARE MEDICAID

04:07:07.780 --> 04:07:12.651 region:rollup2
AGENCIES RUNNING RUNNING

04:07:09.548 --> 04:07:14.086 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IT CETERA.

04:07:12.651 --> 04:07:17.056 region:rollup2
SO FOR PUT SOME NUMBERS ON THE

04:07:14.086 --> 04:07:17.790 region:rollup2
S. ASSUR FOCUSING FIRST ON ON

04:07:17.056 --> 04:07:19.491 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE.

04:07:17.790 --> 04:07:20.359 region:rollup2
AND.

04:07:19.491 --> 04:07:22.061 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FIRST THING TO KNOW IS

04:07:20.359 --> 04:07:23.462 region:rollup2
THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

04:07:22.061 --> 04:07:24.797 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH INSURANCE

04:07:23.462 --> 04:07:27.166 region:rollup2
HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY.

04:07:24.797 --> 04:07:29.168 region:rollup2
OVER OVER RECENT DECADES.

04:07:27.166 --> 04:07:30.235 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY DOUBLING FROM THREE

04:07:29.168 --> 04:07:31.170 region:rollup2
AND A HALF PERCENT OF TOTAL

04:07:30.235 --> 04:07:33.105 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE.

04:07:31.170 --> 04:07:34.606 region:rollup2
SPENDING TO A SEVEN POINT NINE

04:07:33.105 --> 04:07:35.708 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OF HEALTHCARE

04:07:34.606 --> 04:07:37.609 region:rollup2
SPENDING.

04:07:35.708 --> 04:07:39.645 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

04:07:37.609 --> 04:07:42.114 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE AT HOW THAT VARIES

04:07:39.645 --> 04:07:43.015 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY FROM ONE SECTOR TO

04:07:42.114 --> 04:07:44.683 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

04:07:43.015 --> 04:07:46.151 region:rollup2
SO IF WE LOOK AT MEDICARE.

04:07:44.683 --> 04:07:47.319 region:rollup2
IN REALLY HERE WE'RETALKING

04:07:46.151 --> 04:07:52.391 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRADITIONAL FEE FOR

04:07:47.319 --> 04:07:54.893 region:rollup2
SERVICE POINT FOUR PERCENT.

04:07:52.391 --> 04:07:55.994 region:rollup2
OF OF TOTAL HEALTH SPENDING IN

04:07:54.893 --> 04:07:58.363 region:rollup2
IN MEDICARE.

04:07:55.994 --> 04:08:00.199 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S A LITTLE MISLEADING.

04:07:58.363 --> 04:08:01.667 region:rollup2
GIVEN HOW THE CURRENT MEDICARE

04:08:00.199 --> 04:08:03.102 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS RUN.

04:08:01.667 --> 04:08:05.070 region:rollup2
WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW AND

04:08:03.102 --> 04:08:07.339 region:rollup2
ROLE IN PRIVATE PLANS THROUGH

04:08:05.070 --> 04:08:08.741 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE OR PART D.?

04:08:07.339 --> 04:08:09.808 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS FOR

04:08:08.741 --> 04:08:10.509 region:rollup2
DRUGS.

04:08:09.808 --> 04:08:11.844 region:rollup2
IF YOU INCLUDE THE

04:08:10.509 --> 04:08:13.512 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD IN THOSE

04:08:11.844 --> 04:08:14.546 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PLANS THE CONTRACT

04:08:13.512 --> 04:08:15.848 region:rollup2
WITH MEDICARE.

04:08:14.546 --> 04:08:17.683 region:rollup2
IN MINISTRY OF COSTS REPRESENT

04:08:15.848 --> 04:08:19.518 region:rollup2
SEVEN PERCENT.

04:08:17.683 --> 04:08:22.354 region:rollup2
OF OF TOTAL HEALTH SPENDING.

04:08:19.518 --> 04:08:23.355 region:rollup2
NOW MEDICAID EVEN AS A PUBLIC

04:08:22.354 --> 04:08:25.824 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:08:23.355 --> 04:08:26.959 region:rollup2
ALSO CONTRACTS PRIMARILY WITH

04:08:25.824 --> 04:08:28.560 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURERS.

04:08:26.959 --> 04:08:30.696 region:rollup2
TO DELIVER.

04:08:28.560 --> 04:08:32.498 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL BENEFITS OR MEDICAID

04:08:30.696 --> 04:08:34.299 region:rollup2
BENEFITS YEAH IN OTHER STATES.

04:08:32.498 --> 04:08:34.500 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN.

04:08:34.299 --> 04:08:35.968 region:rollup2
AND.

04:08:34.500 --> 04:08:38.303 region:rollup2
.

04:08:35.968 --> 04:08:40.172 region:rollup2
IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN.

04:08:38.303 --> 04:08:41.640 region:rollup2
IN SO OVERALL ADMINISTRATIVE

04:08:40.172 --> 04:08:43.542 region:rollup2
COSTS AND MEDICAID ARE TEN POINT

04:08:41.640 --> 04:08:45.144 region:rollup2
SEVEN PERCENT OF HEALTH SPENDING

04:08:43.542 --> 04:08:46.578 region:rollup2
IF YOU INCLUDE THE OVERHEAD. IN

04:08:45.144 --> 04:08:48.447 region:rollup2
THOSE INSURERS THAT MEDICAID

04:08:46.578 --> 04:08:49.782 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS WITH.

04:08:48.447 --> 04:08:51.216 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY PRIVATE INSURANCE

04:08:49.782 --> 04:08:52.251 region:rollup2
NOT SURPRISINGLY.

04:08:51.216 --> 04:08:53.752 region:rollup2
IS THE.

04:08:52.251 --> 04:08:55.487 region:rollup2
IS THIS IS THE.

04:08:53.752 --> 04:08:57.456 region:rollup2
HAS THE HIGHEST OVERHEAD MANY

04:08:55.487 --> 04:08:59.124 region:rollup2
SECTOR AT ELEVEN POINT FIVE

04:08:57.456 --> 04:09:00.259 region:rollup2
PERCENT ON AVERAGE.

04:08:59.124 --> 04:09:01.193 region:rollup2
THOUGH EVEN THAT VARIES

04:09:00.259 --> 04:09:02.828 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUSLY.

04:09:01.193 --> 04:09:04.596 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A LARGE EMPLOYER WITH

04:09:02.828 --> 04:09:06.398 region:rollup2
A A LARGE GROUP.

04:09:04.596 --> 04:09:08.267 region:rollup2
THAT SELF INSURED.

04:09:06.398 --> 04:09:08.934 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE QUITE A BIT LOWER THAN

04:09:08.267 --> 04:09:10.836 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:09:08.934 --> 04:09:12.404 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE WHICH HAS

04:09:10.836 --> 04:09:14.039 region:rollup2
HIGHER MARKETING COSTS HIGHER

04:09:12.404 --> 04:09:15.340 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT COST I WILL GENERALLY

04:09:14.039 --> 04:09:17.075 region:rollup2
BE HIGHER THAN THAT.

04:09:15.340 --> 04:09:18.644 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY IN THE RANGE OF OF

04:09:17.075 --> 04:09:20.712 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT.

04:09:18.644 --> 04:09:23.482 region:rollup2
AND DON'T KNOW IF FOCUSING ON.

04:09:20.712 --> 04:09:24.116 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INSURERS

04:09:23.482 --> 04:09:25.684 region:rollup2
THE FOR THE CHARACTER ACTUALLY

04:09:24.116 --> 04:09:28.287 region:rollup2
DID I TOOK STEPS TO TRY AND.

04:09:25.684 --> 04:09:29.988 region:rollup2
TRYING REDUCE THESE COSTS.

04:09:28.287 --> 04:09:30.656 region:rollup2
BY SETTING AYE AYE CAPTAIN

04:09:29.988 --> 04:09:33.425 region:rollup2
WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE MEDICAL LOSS

04:09:30.656 --> 04:09:35.761 region:rollup2
RATIO AND THAT'S THE RATIO OF.

04:09:33.425 --> 04:09:37.196 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE EXPENSES THAT AN

04:09:35.761 --> 04:09:39.431 region:rollup2

ENSURE TAKES TAKES SEN.

04:09:41.533 --> 04:09:43.936 region:rollup2
THAT THIS APPLIES TO

04:09:42.601 --> 04:09:46.004 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AND.

04:09:43.936 --> 04:09:47.606 region:rollup2
INSURED GROUPS PRIMARILY SMALL

04:09:46.004 --> 04:09:49.541 region:rollup2
GROUPS BECAUSE SELF INSURED

04:09:47.606 --> 04:09:51.810 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS DON'T.

04:09:49.541 --> 04:09:54.046 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DON'T CONTRACT.

04:09:51.810 --> 04:09:55.214 region:rollup2
DON'T BUY INSURANCE FROM AN

INSURER.

04:09:55.214 --> 04:09:58.217 region:rollup2
AND. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THIS

04:09:57.216 --> 04:10:00.285 region:rollup2
INCLUDES SAID SAID THE.

04:09:58.217 --> 04:10:01.286 region:rollup2

RECEDED MINISTRY TO PART OF IT

04:10:01.286 --> 04:10:02.855 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY INCLUDES WHAT WE THINK

04:10:01.987 --> 04:10:03.589 region:rollup2
OF AS AS CLAIMS PAYMENT

THE.

04:10:08.060 --> 04:10:09.995 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITIONS IN THE

04:10:09.161 --> 04:10:10.496 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ALSO

04:10:09.995 --> 04:10:11.697 region:rollup2
INCLUDED.

04:10:10.496 --> 04:10:14.099 region:rollup2
WINNER KNOWN AS QUALITY

QUALITY. ACCOUNT AS AS.

04:10:22.941 --> 04:10:28.480 region:rollup2
AS HEALTH CARE EXPENSES RATHER

04:10:25.844 --> 04:10:31.383 region:rollup2
THAN THAN OVERHEAD.

04:10:28.480 --> 04:10:33.285 region:rollup2
NOW IN GENERAL THAT LOSS RATIO

04:10:31.383 --> 04:10:34.052 region:rollup2
RULES IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

04:10:33.285 --> 04:10:36.355 region:rollup2
WHICH REQUIRED.

04:10:34.052 --> 04:10:37.789 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL BUSINESS

04:10:36.355 --> 04:10:39.524 region:rollup2
INSURERS TO SPEND AT LEAST

04:10:37.789 --> 04:10:42.828 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEIR PREMIUM

04:10:39.524 --> 04:10:44.196 region:rollup2
REVENUES ON ON CARE OR QUALITY

04:10:42.828 --> 04:10:44.897 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT.

04:10:44.196 --> 04:10:46.665 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT BEEN REALLY

04:10:44.897 --> 04:10:48.834 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINING.

04:10:46.665 --> 04:10:51.970 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE.

04:10:48.834 --> 04:10:54.339 region:rollup2
IN IN MANY STATES INSURERS HAVE

04:10:51.970 --> 04:10:58.443 region:rollup2
BEEN LOSING MONEY SO.

04:10:54.339 --> 04:10:59.678 region:rollup2
SO SO THAT THE LOS RICH YOU'RE

04:10:58.443 --> 04:11:02.514 region:rollup2
HAVING COME INTO PLACE THAT HAS

04:10:59.678 --> 04:11:04.349 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN TRUE IN CALIFORNIA.

04:11:02.514 --> 04:11:05.951 region:rollup2
AND HAS NOT BEEN TRUE IN THE

04:11:04.349 --> 04:11:08.120 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR WHERE MOST INSURERS

04:11:05.951 --> 04:11:09.087 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY MAKING MONEY ON

04:11:08.120 --> 04:11:10.589 region:rollup2
THIS MARKET.

04:11:09.087 --> 04:11:11.723 region:rollup2
BUT THE MARKET'S BEEN VERY

04:11:10.589 --> 04:11:15.193 region:rollup2
PRICE COMPETITIVE.

04:11:11.723 --> 04:11:19.965 region:rollup2
AND HAS DRIVEN PREMIUMS.

04:11:15.193 --> 04:11:22.200 region:rollup2
DOWN AND THE LOSS RATIOS UP.

04:11:19.965 --> 04:11:25.904 region:rollup2
BUT IT HAS HAD AN EFFECT.

04:11:22.200 --> 04:11:27.472 region:rollup2
YEAH INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL

04:11:25.904 --> 04:11:30.409 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES HAVE GOTTEN A

04:11:27.472 --> 04:11:31.543 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL REBATES WHERE

04:11:30.409 --> 04:11:39.885 region:rollup2
INSURERS.

04:11:31.543 --> 04:11:42.254 region:rollup2
I DON'T MEET THE LOSS RATIO

04:11:39.885 --> 04:11:43.622 region:rollup2
BUT. MOST OF THE RESEARCH

04:11:42.254 --> 04:11:45.390 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT.

04:11:43.622 --> 04:11:47.626 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE

04:11:45.390 --> 04:11:49.528 region:rollup2
CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR IN

04:11:47.626 --> 04:11:50.295 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AND AND PHYSICIAN

04:11:49.528 --> 04:11:52.230 region:rollup2
GROUPS.

04:11:50.295 --> 04:11:53.365 region:rollup2
GOES TOWARDS ADMINISTRATION.

04:11:52.230 --> 04:11:55.267 region:rollup2
NOW REMEMBER THIS

04:11:53.365 --> 04:11:57.135 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT JUST.

04:11:55.267 --> 04:11:57.803 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

04:11:57.135 --> 04:11:59.204 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES

04:11:57.803 --> 04:12:01.239 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO.

04:11:59.204 --> 04:12:02.741 region:rollup2
MANAGING THE CLINICAL

04:12:01.239 --> 04:12:04.309 region:rollup2
ENTERPRISE YOU KNOW MANAGING

04:12:02.741 --> 04:12:04.876 region:rollup2
THAT DOCTORS AND.

04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:08.880 region:rollup2
AS.

04:12:04.876 --> 04:12:10.449 region:rollup2
MANY OF SNOW DOCTORS IN YEAH I

04:12:08.880 --> 04:12:10.716 region:rollup2
CAN BE DIFFICULT MANAGE

04:12:10.449 --> 04:12:13.518 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

04:12:10.716 --> 04:12:14.252 region:rollup2
.

04:12:13.518 --> 04:12:15.921 region:rollup2
THE.

04:12:14.252 --> 04:12:19.491 region:rollup2
SERVE IN IF YOU CAN BREAK THAT

04:12:15.921 --> 04:12:22.361 region:rollup2
DOWN IN IN THIS IS BASED ON WORK

04:12:19.491 --> 04:12:25.163 region:rollup2
DATA JIM CON FROM UCSF AND.

04:12:22.361 --> 04:12:26.631 region:rollup2
RICK CHRONIC FROM UC SAN DIEGO

04:12:25.163 --> 04:12:28.767 region:rollup2
DID A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BUT

04:12:26.631 --> 04:12:29.668 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL A PRETTY RELEVANT AYE

04:12:28.767 --> 04:12:30.836 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL

04:12:29.668 --> 04:12:32.604 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN

04:12:30.836 --> 04:12:34.773 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS. IT'S ABOUT

04:12:32.604 --> 04:12:37.242 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE PERCENT. OF TOTAL

04:12:34.773 --> 04:12:38.343 region:rollup2
COSTS BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON JUST

04:12:37.242 --> 04:12:41.279 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF BILLING AND

04:12:38.343 --> 04:12:44.049 region:rollup2
INSURANCE RELATED COSTS. THAT

04:12:41.279 --> 04:12:45.917 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE A TARGET OF A OF A.

04:12:44.049 --> 04:12:47.653 region:rollup2
HEALTH REFORM.

04:12:45.917 --> 04:12:51.189 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

04:12:47.653 --> 04:12:53.592 region:rollup2
THAT TOTAL SIX POINT SIX TO TEN

04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:55.827 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT PERCENT SOCIALIST

04:12:53.592 --> 04:12:57.663 region:rollup2
STILL SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT.

04:12:55.827 --> 04:12:59.131 region:rollup2
BUT NOT MOST OF THE

04:12:57.663 --> 04:13:02.100 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

04:12:59.131 --> 04:13:03.402 region:rollup2
IN A HOSPITAL AND IT'S A VERY

04:13:02.100 --> 04:13:06.004 region:rollup2
SIMILAR STORY WITH.

04:13:03.402 --> 04:13:07.939 region:rollup2
WITH PHYSICIAN GROUPS WHERE

04:13:06.004 --> 04:13:11.109 region:rollup2
TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE

04:13:07.939 --> 04:13:13.078 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT.

04:13:11.109 --> 04:13:16.148 region:rollup2
IN BILLING INSURANCE RELATED

04:13:13.078 --> 04:13:20.285 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE THIRTEEN POINT NINE

04:13:16.148 --> 04:13:21.353 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

04:13:20.285 --> 04:13:23.422 region:rollup2
NOW I'M NO ANOTHER WAY TO THINK

04:13:21.353 --> 04:13:24.589 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS IS COMPARING.

04:13:23.422 --> 04:13:25.223 region:rollup2
THE U. S. TO ANOTHER COUNTRY

04:13:24.589 --> 04:13:33.198 region:rollup2
LIKE STEM THAT REDUCE THIS KIND

04:13:25.223 --> 04:13:36.668 region:rollup2
OF

04:13:33.198 --> 04:13:38.870 region:rollup2
BUILDING AN INSURANCE OVERHEAD.

04:13:36.668 --> 04:13:39.871 region:rollup2
YOU COULD REDUCE STATE NOT JUST

04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:41.206 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED COSTS INSURANCE

04:13:39.871 --> 04:13:43.075 region:rollup2
COMPANIES BUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE

04:13:41.206 --> 04:13:44.543 region:rollup2
COSTS IN PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND

04:13:43.075 --> 04:13:46.344 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL SUBSTANTIALLY AS AS

04:13:44.543 --> 04:13:48.513 region:rollup2
WELL.

04:13:46.344 --> 04:13:49.414 region:rollup2
NOW. JUST TO CONCLUDE ANYTHING

04:13:48.513 --> 04:13:50.449 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT

04:13:49.414 --> 04:13:52.350 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

04:13:50.449 --> 04:13:53.418 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBER OF POLICY DESIGN

04:13:52.350 --> 04:13:54.820 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE.

04:13:53.418 --> 04:13:56.021 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

04:13:54.820 --> 04:13:57.622 region:rollup2
COULD BE REDUCED IN IN A

04:13:56.021 --> 04:13:58.990 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE REFORM PLAN?

04:13:57.622 --> 04:14:00.792 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE IS HOW MUCH COST

04:13:58.990 --> 04:14:01.293 region:rollup2
SHARING PATIENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE

04:14:00.792 --> 04:14:02.494 region:rollup2
FOR.

04:14:01.293 --> 04:14:04.463 region:rollup2
SOME SINGLE PAYER PLANS CALL

04:14:02.494 --> 04:14:05.730 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF

04:14:04.463 --> 04:14:07.265 region:rollup2
PATIENT COST SHARING.

04:14:05.730 --> 04:14:09.167 region:rollup2
IN THAT WOULD CERTAINLY CREATE

04:14:07.265 --> 04:14:10.669 region:rollup2
A MUCH SIMPLER MUCH.

04:14:09.167 --> 04:14:12.204 region:rollup2
LESS ADMINISTRATIVELY COMPLEX

04:14:10.669 --> 04:14:14.606 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:14:12.204 --> 04:14:16.441 region:rollup2
IT ALSO IS MORE EXPENSIVE.

04:14:14.606 --> 04:14:18.443 region:rollup2
IF YOU WERE TO ELIMINATE ALL

04:14:16.441 --> 04:14:20.112 region:rollup2
ALL PATIENT CARSHARING.

04:14:18.443 --> 04:14:21.847 region:rollup2
IN MOST COUNTRIES HAVE NOT DONE

04:14:20.112 --> 04:14:23.281 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:14:21.847 --> 04:14:24.549 region:rollup2
NONE SECOND IS IS THERE STILL A

04:14:23.281 --> 04:14:26.017 region:rollup2
NEED FOR ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS TO

04:14:24.549 --> 04:14:27.753 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN HIGH

04:14:26.017 --> 04:14:29.121 region:rollup2
INCOME AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE.

04:14:27.753 --> 04:14:30.088 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE IS IT A SYSTEM

04:14:29.121 --> 04:14:31.156 region:rollup2
WHERE LOW INCOME PEOPLE GET

04:14:30.088 --> 04:14:32.057 region:rollup2
ENHANCED BENEFITS OR LOWER

04:14:31.156 --> 04:14:33.125 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLES.

04:14:32.057 --> 04:14:33.925 region:rollup2
IN WHICH CASE YOU HAVE TO HAVE

04:14:33.125 --> 04:14:35.293 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF ELIGIBILITY

04:14:33.925 --> 04:14:37.229 region:rollup2
APPARATUS.

04:14:35.293 --> 04:14:38.563 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT AND THAT TAKES A

04:14:37.229 --> 04:14:39.698 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE.

04:14:38.563 --> 04:14:41.733 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT.

04:14:39.698 --> 04:14:43.702 region:rollup2
.

04:14:41.733 --> 04:14:45.537 region:rollup2
HE NO WE WE WE WE THINK OF.

04:14:43.702 --> 04:14:46.138 region:rollup2
A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IS BEING

04:14:45.537 --> 04:14:47.672 region:rollup2
MUCH SIMPLER AND IT CERTAINLY

04:14:46.138 --> 04:14:49.141 region:rollup2
IS.

04:14:47.672 --> 04:14:50.509 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS STILL A PAIR OF

04:14:49.141 --> 04:14:52.477 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE MINUTE WILL STILL BE

04:14:50.509 --> 04:14:53.445 region:rollup2
UNDER PRESSURE TO CONTROL COSTS.

04:14:52.477 --> 04:14:55.213 region:rollup2
AND OME OF THAT PRESSURE FOR

04:14:53.445 --> 04:14:57.115 region:rollup2
CONTROL MAY INVOLVE.

04:14:55.213 --> 04:14:58.583 region:rollup2
PUTTING AT PUTTING IN PLACE

04:14:57.115 --> 04:14:59.851 region:rollup2
PAYMENT SYSTEMS THAT THAT LAUREN

04:14:58.583 --> 04:15:00.852 region:rollup2
AND AARON TALKED ABOUT.

04:14:59.851 --> 04:15:02.487 region:rollup2
PUTTING IN PLACE PRIOR

04:15:00.852 --> 04:15:04.456 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATION YOU KNOW FOR

04:15:02.487 --> 04:15:05.023 region:rollup2
HOSPITALIZATIONS OR OR SPECIALTY

04:15:04.456 --> 04:15:06.525 region:rollup2
CARE.

04:15:05.023 --> 04:15:08.226 region:rollup2
IN THAT AGAIN ALL TAKES

04:15:06.525 --> 04:15:09.161 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD SO SOME

04:15:08.226 --> 04:15:10.829 region:rollup2
OF THAT ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD

04:15:09.161 --> 04:15:13.031 region:rollup2
THAT INSURERS ARE NOW SPENDING

04:15:10.829 --> 04:15:15.167 region:rollup2
MIGHT TRANSLATE TO A A PUBLIC

04:15:13.031 --> 04:15:18.603 region:rollup2
PLAN. ARM AS WELL.

04:15:15.167 --> 04:15:22.340 region:rollup2
IN AND FINALLY JUST HOW COMPLEX.

04:15:18.603 --> 04:15:22.674 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEM IS AND AND I

04:15:22.340 --> 04:15:24.109 region:rollup2
WOULD DO THAT.

04:15:22.674 --> 04:15:25.310 region:rollup2
.

04:15:24.109 --> 04:15:27.279 region:rollup2
CONCLUDE BY LEAVING YOU WITH

04:15:25.310 --> 04:15:27.512 region:rollup2
THAT. SORT OF A SUGGESTED GOAL

04:15:27.279 --> 04:15:28.113 region:rollup2
WHICH.

04:15:27.512 --> 04:15:28.947 region:rollup2
FOR ALL OF THIS WHICH I THINK

04:15:28.113 --> 04:15:30.816 region:rollup2
IS SIMPLICITY.

04:15:28.947 --> 04:15:32.250 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WE HEALTHCARE

04:15:30.816 --> 04:15:32.818 region:rollup2
EXPERTS I HAVE A KNACK FOR

04:15:32.250 --> 04:15:35.587 region:rollup2
MAKING THINGS.

04:15:32.818 --> 04:15:37.455 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED. HOME AND.

04:15:35.587 --> 04:15:38.623 region:rollup2
IN CERTAINLY YOU KNOW A DESIRE

04:15:37.455 --> 04:15:39.791 region:rollup2
TO TO SATISFY COMPETING

04:15:38.623 --> 04:15:41.493 region:rollup2
INTERESTS ARE COMPETING

04:15:39.791 --> 04:15:43.128 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS I GENERALLY

04:15:41.493 --> 04:15:45.597 region:rollup2
INCREASES THE COMPLEXITY.

04:15:43.128 --> 04:15:47.599 region:rollup2
OF A PROGRAM OR A PLAN.

04:15:45.597 --> 04:15:49.434 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW SELLING A HEALTH

04:15:47.599 --> 04:15:50.769 region:rollup2
REFORM PLAN TO THE PUBLIC AND

04:15:49.434 --> 04:15:52.437 region:rollup2
MAKING IT SUSTAINABLE.

04:15:50.769 --> 04:15:52.938 region:rollup2
I THINK REQUIRE SOMETHING

04:15:52.437 --> 04:15:54.973 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

04:15:52.938 --> 04:15:57.309 region:rollup2
THAT'S MUCH SIMPLER THEN.

04:15:54.973 --> 04:15:58.610 region:rollup2
THEN THEN WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND

04:15:57.309 --> 04:16:00.612 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THEN THE AFFORDABLE

04:15:58.610 --> 04:16:04.349 region:rollup2
CARE ACT WHICH ITSELF IS THAT.

04:16:00.612 --> 04:16:06.117 region:rollup2
IS QUITE COMPLEX.

04:16:04.349 --> 04:16:08.086 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

04:16:06.117 --> 04:16:09.754 region:rollup2
SO UP A FEW THINGS WERE GOING TO

04:16:08.086 --> 04:16:11.389 region:rollup2
NOW TAKE QUESTIONS TO THE DíAS

04:16:09.754 --> 04:16:13.124 region:rollup2

TEN MINUTES.

04:16:23.768 --> 04:16:26.872 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THREE MICROPHONES

04:16:25.337 --> 04:16:28.673 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE TWO OF

04:16:26.872 --> 04:16:30.375 region:rollup2

BEFORE WE ASK QUESTIONS OF THE

04:16:38.650 --> 04:16:41.653 region:rollup2
NEXT.

WHO ARE HERE I.

04:16:42.420 --> 04:16:47.659 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

04:16:45.924 --> 04:16:48.894 region:rollup2
HOW TO BE REALLY QUICK BECAUSE I

04:16:47.659 --> 04:16:50.962 region:rollup2
WANT TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTS IS

04:16:48.894 --> 04:16:51.997 region:rollup2

WEEK.

04:16:53.865 --> 04:16:58.103 region:rollup2
MY FIRST QUITE YOU KNOW I I

04:16:56.835 --> 04:17:00.538 region:rollup2
MEAN I'M NOT A HEALTHCARE

04:16:58.103 --> 04:17:02.307 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL I'M TOOL CIVILIAN

04:17:00.538 --> 04:17:03.341 region:rollup2
SO I'VE PRETTY MUCH LEARNED.

04:17:02.307 --> 04:17:04.743 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT

04:17:03.341 --> 04:17:06.544 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE FROM THE LAST IN THE

04:17:04.743 --> 04:17:08.747 region:rollup2
SERIES OF HEARINGS SO EXCUSE ME

04:17:06.544 --> 04:17:12.017 region:rollup2
IF MY QUESTIONS ARE.

04:17:08.747 --> 04:17:13.018 region:rollup2
REALLY ADELINE. KAISER CREDIT

04:17:12.017 --> 04:17:15.520 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR HOUSE CARE MODEL

04:17:13.018 --> 04:17:17.222 region:rollup2
WITHIN ITS LITTLE UNIVERSE IS IT

04:17:15.520 --> 04:17:18.757 region:rollup2
IN IT IN AN OF ITSELF AS IT

04:17:17.222 --> 04:17:21.493 region:rollup2
CONTAINS SYSTEM A SINGLE PAYER

04:17:18.757 --> 04:17:26.932 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:17:21.493 --> 04:17:28.133 region:rollup2
KIND OF AND HOW IT OPERATES.

04:17:26.932 --> 04:17:30.502 region:rollup2
YOU GONNA SAY NO OFFICE NO NO

04:17:28.133 --> 04:17:31.636 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY AND. NOW SO I'M A

04:17:30.502 --> 04:17:32.704 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WE WOULD

04:17:31.636 --> 04:17:34.139 region:rollup2
NORMALLY SAY IS.

04:17:32.704 --> 04:17:36.141 region:rollup2
.

04:17:34.139 --> 04:17:37.208 region:rollup2
COMMONLY AYE TAX FINANCE

04:17:36.141 --> 04:17:38.910 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT RUN SYSTEM THAT

04:17:37.208 --> 04:17:40.779 region:rollup2
PROVIDES INSURANCE TO A LARGE

04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:43.315 region:rollup2
GROUP OF THE POPULATION HAWKEYE

04:17:40.779 --> 04:17:45.350 region:rollup2
AND SO KINDER. I YOU KNOW IF YOU

04:17:43.315 --> 04:17:46.751 region:rollup2
IF YOU USE THAT A LARGE DELIVERY

04:17:45.350 --> 04:17:48.753 region:rollup2
NETWORK LIKE THAT TO PROVIDE

04:17:46.751 --> 04:17:50.288 region:rollup2
CARE FOR A. BUNCH OF CALIFORNIA

04:17:48.753 --> 04:17:50.889 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE MAKE IT CLOSER TO IT

04:17:50.288 --> 04:17:53.591 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T THINK WE NORMALLY

04:17:50.889 --> 04:17:54.059 region:rollup2
SAY KAISER IS A SINGLE PAYER

04:17:53.591 --> 04:17:54.392 region:rollup2
SYSTEM GOT IT HAS SOME

04:17:54.059 --> 04:17:55.360 region:rollup2
SIMILARITIES.

04:17:54.392 --> 04:17:55.794 region:rollup2
SO

04:17:55.360 --> 04:17:58.797 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE

04:17:55.794 --> 04:18:00.065 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

04:17:58.797 --> 04:18:01.967 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THE IN THE

04:18:00.065 --> 04:18:02.834 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THE INSURANCE.

04:18:01.967 --> 04:18:03.401 region:rollup2
SO OF ADMINISTRATION OF THE

04:18:02.834 --> 04:18:05.804 region:rollup2
SYSTEM NOT INTERNAL COSTS AT

04:18:03.401 --> 04:18:06.738 region:rollup2
ANY.

04:18:05.804 --> 04:18:10.008 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S

04:18:06.738 --> 04:18:11.443 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER OR NOT HAS THE

04:18:10.008 --> 04:18:12.544 region:rollup2
STATISTIC YOU SHOW TO THE

04:18:11.443 --> 04:18:13.111 region:rollup2
DEFENSE IN THE U. S. AND CANADA

04:18:12.544 --> 04:18:13.912 region:rollup2
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT TEN

04:18:13.111 --> 04:18:15.547 region:rollup2
PERCENT DIFFERENCE.

04:18:13.912 --> 04:18:16.348 region:rollup2
TO ADMINISTER. THAT.

04:18:15.547 --> 04:18:18.583 region:rollup2
.

04:18:16.348 --> 04:18:20.251 region:rollup2
UP.

04:18:18.583 --> 04:18:22.454 region:rollup2
THAT SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO THE

04:18:20.251 --> 04:18:24.689 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE HERE.

04:18:22.454 --> 04:18:26.691 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS

04:18:24.689 --> 04:18:28.126 region:rollup2
VERY INTERESTED IN LISTENING FOR

04:18:26.691 --> 04:18:31.830 region:rollup2
YOU TOUCHED ON IT A BIT. I'M

04:18:28.126 --> 04:18:33.031 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY MISTER BAKER BUT

04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:34.566 region:rollup2
ALSO MISTER LEVITT.

04:18:33.031 --> 04:18:36.201 region:rollup2
IS OUR SYSTEM DRIVEN BY.

04:18:34.566 --> 04:18:38.303 region:rollup2
MARKET FORCES.

04:18:36.201 --> 04:18:40.638 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO THE EUROPEAN

04:18:38.303 --> 04:18:42.574 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS ALL OF WHICH.

04:18:40.638 --> 04:18:44.843 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOT THAT SEEMS TO ME TAKE

04:18:42.574 --> 04:18:46.111 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THOSE MARKET. DRIVERS

04:18:44.843 --> 04:18:48.013 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND REPLACE

04:18:46.111 --> 04:18:50.048 region:rollup2
THEM WITH PURE REGULATION.

04:18:48.013 --> 04:18:51.649 region:rollup2
OR A LOT OF REGULATION SO THEY

04:18:50.048 --> 04:18:52.684 region:rollup2
HAVE THEY HAVE HAVE AS FAR AS I

04:18:51.649 --> 04:18:54.486 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT THEY HAVE VERY

04:18:52.684 --> 04:18:55.987 region:rollup2
HEAVILY REGULATED COST

04:18:54.486 --> 04:18:57.055 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT.

04:18:55.987 --> 04:18:59.257 region:rollup2
WHERE IS OURS IS COMPLETELY

04:18:57.055 --> 04:18:59.424 region:rollup2
MARKET DRIVEN?

04:18:59.257 --> 04:19:01.025 region:rollup2
SO.

04:18:59.424 --> 04:19:03.094 region:rollup2
.

04:19:01.025 --> 04:19:04.629 region:rollup2
JUST A COMMENT IT JUST IT SEEMS

04:19:03.094 --> 04:19:07.065 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE

04:19:04.629 --> 04:19:08.767 region:rollup2
COST THEN BETWEEN AT TEN PERCENT

04:19:07.065 --> 04:19:10.802 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THAT IS IS ATTRIBUTABLE

04:19:08.767 --> 04:19:12.904 region:rollup2
TO THE SYSTEM.

04:19:10.802 --> 04:19:14.706 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE WERE TO IMPLEMENT

04:19:12.904 --> 04:19:15.540 region:rollup2
WHAT'S A SINGLE PAYER TOMORROW

04:19:14.706 --> 04:19:16.708 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE REST OF THE COST

04:19:15.540 --> 04:19:18.042 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING

04:19:16.708 --> 04:19:18.610 region:rollup2
AT SAVING TEN PERCENT BUT WHAT

04:19:18.042 --> 04:19:20.211 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCES IS THAT THEY

04:19:18.610 --> 04:19:21.546 region:rollup2
ARE.

04:19:20.211 --> 04:19:22.814 region:rollup2
REGULATING ACROSS THEIR ENTIRE

04:19:21.546 --> 04:19:24.215 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:19:22.814 --> 04:19:26.184 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING ON

04:19:24.215 --> 04:19:28.686 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOW THE MARKET WHETHER

04:19:26.184 --> 04:19:29.053 region:rollup2
IT'S HOSPITALS DOCTORS INSURANCE

04:19:28.686 --> 04:19:31.656 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ANYONE

04:19:29.053 --> 04:19:34.592 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICALS.

04:19:31.656 --> 04:19:36.261 region:rollup2
ANY COMPANY OR PERSON WHO

04:19:34.592 --> 04:19:38.096 region:rollup2
TOUCHES HEALTHCARE.

04:19:36.261 --> 04:19:38.630 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO REGULATE THE

04:19:38.096 --> 04:19:40.732 region:rollup2
PROFITS OR IF THE PAYMENT

04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:41.699 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

04:19:40.732 --> 04:19:43.902 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GETTING

04:19:41.699 --> 04:19:45.703 region:rollup2
THE BULK OF THEIR COST SAVINGS.

04:19:43.902 --> 04:19:47.005 region:rollup2
SO SINGLE PAYER.

04:19:45.703 --> 04:19:49.207 region:rollup2
ITS ELEGANT IT'S OF.

04:19:47.005 --> 04:19:50.508 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT.

04:19:49.207 --> 04:19:51.943 region:rollup2
BUT HE DOESN'T GET YOU THERE

04:19:50.508 --> 04:19:52.577 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A REALLY GOING

04:19:51.943 --> 04:19:54.512 region:rollup2
TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT CONTROLLING

04:19:52.577 --> 04:19:56.481 region:rollup2
COSTS.

04:19:54.512 --> 04:19:58.450 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE.

04:19:56.481 --> 04:19:59.684 region:rollup2
THE WE CAN'T ALLOW THE FREE

04:19:58.450 --> 04:20:01.953 region:rollup2
MARKET ANY LONGER WITH ITS

04:19:59.684 --> 04:20:03.922 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATIONS AND ITS LACK OF

04:20:01.953 --> 04:20:06.591 region:rollup2
BALANCE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE

04:20:03.922 --> 04:20:08.693 region:rollup2
TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS.

04:20:06.591 --> 04:20:09.961 region:rollup2
WE AS THE GOVERNMENT.

04:20:08.693 --> 04:20:11.596 region:rollup2
ARE THE ONLY ONES IN THE

04:20:09.961 --> 04:20:14.666 region:rollup2
POSITION OF ACTUALLY TAKING ALL

04:20:11.596 --> 04:20:15.533 region:rollup2
OF THOSE UNREGULATED PROFITS.

04:20:14.666 --> 04:20:17.202 region:rollup2
THAT ARE RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN

04:20:15.533 --> 04:20:18.002 region:rollup2
DRIVING THOSE COSTS UP AND UP

04:20:17.202 --> 04:20:18.870 region:rollup2
AND UP.

04:20:18.002 --> 04:20:22.073 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:25.410 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

04:20:22.073 --> 04:20:28.713 region:rollup2
I MEAN IS I AM I AM SORT OF

04:20:25.410 --> 04:20:29.781 region:rollup2
HEARING.

04:20:28.713 --> 04:20:30.381 region:rollup2
NO I WOULD SAY THERE THERE ARE

04:20:29.781 --> 04:20:31.583 region:rollup2
COMPARING THE U. S. SYSTEM TO

04:20:30.381 --> 04:20:33.118 region:rollup2
TO.

04:20:31.583 --> 04:20:34.752 region:rollup2
INTERNET OTHER HIGH INCOME

04:20:33.118 --> 04:20:36.754 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES THERE REALLY TO.

04:20:34.752 --> 04:20:37.989 region:rollup2
TO TWO SOURCES OF OF SAVINGS

04:20:36.754 --> 04:20:39.557 region:rollup2
WHEN HIS ADMINISTRATION.

04:20:37.989 --> 04:20:41.092 region:rollup2
WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT EVEN THAT

04:20:39.557 --> 04:20:41.926 region:rollup2
THAT CANADIAN EXAMPLE IS JUST

04:20:41.092 --> 04:20:43.328 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS SO THAT'S ACTUALLY

04:20:41.926 --> 04:20:44.662 region:rollup2
JUST A PIECE.

04:20:43.328 --> 04:20:45.864 region:rollup2
A PIECE OF IT YOU WOULD ALSO SEE

04:20:44.662 --> 04:20:47.332 region:rollup2
SAVINGS AND.

04:20:45.864 --> 04:20:48.500 region:rollup2
IN HEALTH INSURANCE KNOW

04:20:47.332 --> 04:20:50.335 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

04:20:48.500 --> 04:20:51.803 region:rollup2
AND AND PROFIT.

04:20:50.335 --> 04:20:53.438 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THE OTHER.

04:20:51.803 --> 04:20:55.173 region:rollup2
AS YOU SUGGESTED IS IT'S IT'S

04:20:53.438 --> 04:20:57.909 region:rollup2
PRICES GENERALLY THAT THAT EVERY

04:20:55.173 --> 04:21:00.078 region:rollup2
OTHER SYSTEM.

04:20:57.909 --> 04:21:00.778 region:rollup2
CARVES OUT A GREATER ROLE FOR

04:21:00.078 --> 04:21:03.414 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

04:21:00.778 --> 04:21:04.949 region:rollup2
IN IN REGULATING PRICES.

04:21:03.414 --> 04:21:05.650 region:rollup2
MANY VARIES FROM ONE SYSTEM TO

04:21:04.949 --> 04:21:07.252 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

04:21:05.650 --> 04:21:09.087 region:rollup2
HOW IT'S DONE?

04:21:07.252 --> 04:21:10.922 region:rollup2
AND HOW COMPREHENSIVE IT IS BUT

04:21:09.087 --> 04:21:13.258 region:rollup2
I I WOULD SAY EVERY OTHER.

04:21:10.922 --> 04:21:14.392 region:rollup2
HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES REGULATES.

04:21:13.258 --> 04:21:17.862 region:rollup2
PRICES.

04:21:14.392 --> 04:21:20.532 region:rollup2
IN ONE ONE WAY OR OR ANOTHER.

04:21:17.862 --> 04:21:22.867 region:rollup2
NOW THERE IS A SOURCE OF THOSE

04:21:20.532 --> 04:21:24.903 region:rollup2
ARE TWO SOURCES OF SAVINGS.

04:21:22.867 --> 04:21:28.873 region:rollup2
FROM MOVING TO A.

04:21:24.903 --> 04:21:29.741 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER OR TAX FINANCE

04:21:28.873 --> 04:21:32.310 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:21:29.741 --> 04:21:34.178 region:rollup2
I MEAN THERE IS A SOURCE OF

04:21:32.310 --> 04:21:35.580 region:rollup2
COSTS TO OBVIOUSLY.

04:21:34.178 --> 04:21:37.081 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW COVERING.

04:21:35.580 --> 04:21:39.684 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE DON'T PROVIDE

04:21:37.081 --> 04:21:41.452 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SO COVERING

04:21:39.684 --> 04:21:43.421 region:rollup2
AS ADDITIONAL PEOPLE.

04:21:41.452 --> 04:21:47.258 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY COVERING THEM AT

04:21:43.421 --> 04:21:49.894 region:rollup2
LOWER COST PATIENT CARSHARING.

04:21:47.258 --> 04:21:52.530 region:rollup2
WOULD COST MONEY SO KIND OF THE

04:21:49.894 --> 04:21:53.731 region:rollup2
CALCULATION IS HOW MUCH COULD

04:21:52.530 --> 04:21:54.799 region:rollup2
YOU SAVE.

04:21:53.731 --> 04:21:57.602 region:rollup2
ON THE BY REDUCING

04:21:54.799 --> 04:21:59.337 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION REDUCING PRICES

04:21:57.602 --> 04:22:01.573 region:rollup2
AND THEN HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST

04:21:59.337 --> 04:22:02.207 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO BRING EVERYONE INTO

04:22:01.573 --> 04:22:03.841 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

04:22:02.207 --> 04:22:05.310 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO ON.

04:22:03.841 --> 04:22:07.378 region:rollup2
I MEAN YOU KNOW THAT THAT SHOWS

04:22:05.310 --> 04:22:09.147 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF THE.

04:22:07.378 --> 04:22:10.081 region:rollup2
TO REALLY BRING THE THE TRUE.

04:22:09.147 --> 04:22:11.916 region:rollup2
COST SAVINGS THAT WE WOULD NEED

04:22:10.081 --> 04:22:13.251 region:rollup2
TO DO WE WANT TO DO IS GOING TO

04:22:11.916 --> 04:22:14.719 region:rollup2
TAKE OF OBVIOUSLY A TREMENDOUS

04:22:13.251 --> 04:22:16.754 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF CHANGE YOU TALKED

04:22:14.719 --> 04:22:18.156 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE DISRUPTIVE EFFECT AND.

04:22:16.754 --> 04:22:19.591 region:rollup2
OVER LEVEL OF REGULATION THAT

04:22:18.156 --> 04:22:20.225 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY HAVE NEVER HAD WITH

04:22:19.591 --> 04:22:20.525 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT

04:22:20.225 --> 04:22:21.859 region:rollup2
I KNOW OF.

04:22:20.525 --> 04:22:23.795 region:rollup2
.

04:22:21.859 --> 04:22:24.629 region:rollup2
UP IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S JUST.

04:22:23.795 --> 04:22:25.530 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WE LOOK AT ALL THESE

04:22:24.629 --> 04:22:26.431 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE HAVING

04:22:25.530 --> 04:22:27.732 region:rollup2
AT LEAST EQUAL IF NOT BETTER

04:22:26.431 --> 04:22:29.701 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE RESULTS.

04:22:27.732 --> 04:22:30.935 region:rollup2
WITH THE REGULATION AND.

04:22:29.701 --> 04:22:32.470 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN

04:22:30.935 --> 04:22:34.939 region:rollup2
UNDER CONTROL WHAT SEEMS TO BE

04:22:32.470 --> 04:22:36.240 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH A CA. A AN UNRAVELING

04:22:34.939 --> 04:22:38.743 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

04:22:36.240 --> 04:22:39.677 region:rollup2
WITH COSTS REALLY SPIRALING A

04:22:38.743 --> 04:22:41.079 region:rollup2
LOT HE HAS REALLY ACROSS THE

04:22:39.677 --> 04:22:41.913 region:rollup2
COUNTRY MAYBE LESS IN CALIFORNIA

04:22:41.079 --> 04:22:43.615 region:rollup2
AND WE DO HAVE COST CONTAINMENT

04:22:41.913 --> 04:22:45.350 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN MEDICAID MEDI CAL AND

04:22:43.615 --> 04:22:46.017 region:rollup2
THE VA SYSTEM.

04:22:45.350 --> 04:22:47.819 region:rollup2
DOES HAVE A LOT YOU KNOW APPEAR

04:22:46.017 --> 04:22:49.954 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THOSE

04:22:47.819 --> 04:22:52.590 region:rollup2
COSTS AND WE SEE NOSY SHOWN

04:22:49.954 --> 04:22:54.058 region:rollup2
LOWER COSTS.

04:22:52.590 --> 04:22:55.960 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE PRETTY GOOD DELIVERY

04:22:54.058 --> 04:22:57.195 region:rollup2
OF OF CARE YOU KNOW THAT DOCTORS

04:22:55.960 --> 04:22:57.629 region:rollup2
MAYBE AREN'T HAPPY WITH THE

04:22:57.195 --> 04:22:59.297 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

04:22:57.629 --> 04:23:00.932 region:rollup2
.

04:22:59.297 --> 04:23:02.400 region:rollup2
IN HOSPITALS BUT BUT

04:23:00.932 --> 04:23:04.602 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING.

04:23:02.400 --> 04:23:05.903 region:rollup2
SO. THAT'S SORT OF MY TAKE AWAY

04:23:04.602 --> 04:23:06.738 region:rollup2
HERE BUT IF I'M MISSING BIG

04:23:05.903 --> 04:23:07.739 region:rollup2
PIECES ARE.

04:23:06.738 --> 04:23:08.940 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'D.

04:23:07.739 --> 04:23:13.778 region:rollup2
YEAH.

04:23:08.940 --> 04:23:15.446 region:rollup2
FILL ME IN.

04:23:13.778 --> 04:23:17.315 region:rollup2
NOW THIS OUT ADD A LITTLE BIT TO

04:23:15.446 --> 04:23:19.017 region:rollup2
SO WHAT LARRY SAID I THINK BIG

04:23:17.315 --> 04:23:19.584 region:rollup2
THE KEY IS WHO'S GONNA PUSH BACK

04:23:19.017 --> 04:23:21.486 region:rollup2
INTO THERE ARE LOT OF THINGS

04:23:19.584 --> 04:23:23.421 region:rollup2
PUSHING PRICES UP.

04:23:21.486 --> 04:23:25.189 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF.

04:23:23.421 --> 04:23:25.790 region:rollup2
WELL WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT A LOT

04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:27.325 region:rollup2
OF THEM IN THE US HAS BUILT A

04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:28.626 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFUSE.

04:23:27.325 --> 04:23:30.294 region:rollup2
SET OF FOLKS ON THE OTHER SIDE

04:23:28.626 --> 04:23:31.963 region:rollup2
OF THE TABLE THAT HAVEN'T GOTTEN

04:23:30.294 --> 04:23:33.364 region:rollup2
THEIR ACT TOGETHER IN THE WAY

04:23:31.963 --> 04:23:35.133 region:rollup2
THAT SOME THE EUROPEAN SYSTEMS

04:23:33.364 --> 04:23:37.168 region:rollup2
BY ONE MECHANISM OR ANOTHER MORE

04:23:35.133 --> 04:23:38.469 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT MORE EMPOWERED. OTHER

04:23:37.168 --> 04:23:40.038 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS HOW ARE THERE INSURERS

04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:41.973 region:rollup2
HOWEVER YOU DO IT AYE HAS BEEN

04:23:40.038 --> 04:23:43.007 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PUSH BACK THAT CREATES

04:23:41.973 --> 04:23:44.575 region:rollup2
THEN THAT WOULD CREATE THEN

04:23:43.007 --> 04:23:46.978 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO CREATE SOME SOME.

04:23:44.575 --> 04:23:48.146 region:rollup2
OF PRESSURE IN THE US FOR LOWER

04:23:46.978 --> 04:23:49.247 region:rollup2
PRICES TO THE EXTENT OF PRICES

04:23:48.146 --> 04:23:50.882 region:rollup2
ARE HIGHER THAN THEY HAVE TO BE

04:23:49.247 --> 04:23:53.051 region:rollup2
TO DELIVER SERVICES. IT WOULD

04:23:50.882 --> 04:23:54.118 region:rollup2
ALSO PUT PRESSURE ON OTHER.

04:23:53.051 --> 04:23:55.753 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM

04:23:54.118 --> 04:23:56.954 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT MEAN DIFFERENT KINDS OF

04:23:55.753 --> 04:23:58.456 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

04:23:56.954 --> 04:23:59.891 region:rollup2
SERVICES AVAILABLE IT MIGHT MEAN

04:23:58.456 --> 04:24:01.359 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KINDS OF DOCTORS IN

04:23:59.891 --> 04:24:02.827 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM IN THE LONG RUN.

04:24:01.359 --> 04:24:03.561 region:rollup2
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR US

04:24:02.827 --> 04:24:04.929 region:rollup2
A BUT IT WOULD ENTAIL SOME

04:24:03.561 --> 04:24:06.130 region:rollup2
CHANGE TO THAT PUSH BACK WOULD

04:24:04.929 --> 04:24:07.432 region:rollup2
CREATE A LOT OF THAT TENSION IN

04:24:06.130 --> 04:24:08.833 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT OUR

04:24:07.432 --> 04:24:10.401 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. IN

04:24:08.833 --> 04:24:12.370 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE IT WOULD MAKE A

04:24:10.401 --> 04:24:14.005 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT LOWER COSTS

04:24:12.370 --> 04:24:15.707 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE

04:24:14.005 --> 04:24:17.108 region:rollup2
DELIVERY AND WHO'S DELIVERING IT

04:24:15.707 --> 04:24:20.011 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING THEM.

04:24:17.108 --> 04:24:21.379 region:rollup2
THOSE DISK DOES DISCUSSIONS WHAT

04:24:20.011 --> 04:24:22.180 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IN THE CONTEXT OF

04:24:21.379 --> 04:24:22.780 region:rollup2
THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER

04:24:22.180 --> 04:24:23.514 region:rollup2
THING THAT'S HAPPENED IN THOSE

04:24:22.780 --> 04:24:24.182 region:rollup2
IN THOSE OTHER SYSTEMS. IS

04:24:23.514 --> 04:24:25.416 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HAD MANY YEARS OF THOSE

04:24:24.182 --> 04:24:26.551 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS WE WOULD HAVE TO

04:24:25.416 --> 04:24:28.219 region:rollup2
START THEM FRESH THEY BE

04:24:26.551 --> 04:24:29.454 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO DO. AYE BUT THEY

04:24:28.219 --> 04:24:32.857 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT WOULD SORT OF PUSH US

04:24:29.454 --> 04:24:35.193 region:rollup2
IN THAT DIRECTION AS YOU SEE.

04:24:32.857 --> 04:24:36.527 region:rollup2

BEING ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE

04:24:39.230 --> 04:24:42.400 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IS IN A

04:24:41.265 --> 04:24:43.968 region:rollup2
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN LOOKING

04:24:42.400 --> 04:24:44.869 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO HOLY THROUGH ALL

04:24:43.968 --> 04:24:46.704 region:rollup2
THESE HEARINGS.

.

04:24:46.704 --> 04:24:51.008 region:rollup2
MY BROTHER IS A PHYSICIAN IN NEW

04:24:48.606 --> 04:24:52.744 region:rollup2
YORK AND HE HAS TO BASICALLY

04:24:51.008 --> 04:24:54.979 region:rollup2
COVER THE COST OF ABOUT NINETY

04:24:52.744 --> 04:24:56.347 region:rollup2
FIVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

04:24:54.979 --> 04:24:58.149 region:rollup2
A YEAR. JUST DEALING WITH PLAN

04:24:56.347 --> 04:24:59.383 region:rollup2
THE NILES

04:24:58.149 --> 04:25:01.285 region:rollup2
AND PAPERWORK.

04:24:59.383 --> 04:25:02.487 region:rollup2
APPEALS.

04:25:01.285 --> 04:25:05.556 region:rollup2
SO HAD THEY HAVE THEM IN THE

04:25:02.487 --> 04:25:05.923 region:rollup2
OFFICE SPACE STAFF TO HANDLE IT.

04:25:05.556 --> 04:25:07.992 region:rollup2
A FULL TIME JOB.

04:25:05.923 --> 04:25:10.528 region:rollup2
.

04:25:07.992 --> 04:25:12.130 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY GET IS IN NO RESPONSE

04:25:10.528 --> 04:25:13.931 region:rollup2
OF OLD THEY'VE LOST THE

04:25:12.130 --> 04:25:15.166 region:rollup2
PAPERWORK THEN THEY HAVE TO

04:25:13.931 --> 04:25:16.701 region:rollup2
RESCIND THE NAME RECESS I MEAN?

04:25:15.166 --> 04:25:17.935 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S A CONSTANT PROBLEM

04:25:16.701 --> 04:25:19.937 region:rollup2
MEANWHILE THE PATIENCE WAITING

04:25:17.935 --> 04:25:21.572 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT IS IN NO.

04:25:19.937 --> 04:25:23.241 region:rollup2
LOST IN THE SHUFFLE LITERALLY

04:25:21.572 --> 04:25:24.208 region:rollup2
I'M.

04:25:23.241 --> 04:25:26.277 region:rollup2
THEM WE LOOK AT OTHER THINGS

04:25:24.208 --> 04:25:28.246 region:rollup2
LIKE EVIDENCE BASED CARE VERSUS

04:25:26.277 --> 04:25:29.680 region:rollup2
THE UNNECESSARY TREATMENTS AND

04:25:28.246 --> 04:25:32.183 region:rollup2
EXTRA TESTS BECAUSE PEOPLE

04:25:29.680 --> 04:25:33.584 region:rollup2
AFRAID OF GETTING SUED. ON IN

04:25:32.183 --> 04:25:35.753 region:rollup2
THOSE IS HOLD A LEVEL BEYOND

04:25:33.584 --> 04:25:38.089 region:rollup2
JUST

04:25:35.753 --> 04:25:40.124 region:rollup2
I CARE IN YOU KNOW HOW WE HOW WE

04:25:38.089 --> 04:25:41.392 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO WITH ACCESS.

04:25:40.124 --> 04:25:43.895 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE MY MOTHER LOVES

04:25:41.392 --> 04:25:45.329 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THREE CURRENTLY BUT SHE

04:25:43.895 --> 04:25:47.999 region:rollup2
HAS A BACK INJURY.

04:25:45.329 --> 04:25:50.434 region:rollup2
IT TOOK THREE DOCTORS TO FINALLY

04:25:47.999 --> 04:25:52.403 region:rollup2
GET A REFERRAL TO SO SHE CAN GET

04:25:50.434 --> 04:25:53.171 region:rollup2
AN EPIDURAL BUT IN THE MEANTIME

04:25:52.403 --> 04:25:54.872 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE CLEARED BY AN

04:25:53.171 --> 04:25:56.741 region:rollup2
NEUROLOGISTS WHO WAS TRYING TO

04:25:54.872 --> 04:25:57.708 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT IF SHE HAD DEMENTIA.

04:25:56.741 --> 04:25:59.443 region:rollup2
AND SHE'S EIGHTY THREE SHE GETS

04:25:57.708 --> 04:26:00.845 region:rollup2
UPSET SHE DOESN'T CLEARLY OF

04:25:59.443 --> 04:26:02.013 region:rollup2
DEMENTIA BUT THEY HAVE TO GO

04:26:00.845 --> 04:26:03.381 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL THESE OTHER THINGS

04:26:02.013 --> 04:26:05.817 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY FINALLY GIVEN UP

04:26:03.381 --> 04:26:07.618 region:rollup2
ADORO AND IS JUST UNNECESSARY

04:26:05.817 --> 04:26:08.953 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY UNNECESSARY. YOU OF

04:26:07.618 --> 04:26:10.621 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS WHO WERE STARING AT A

04:26:08.953 --> 04:26:13.858 region:rollup2
SCREEN AND I KNOW BECAUSE I

04:26:10.621 --> 04:26:15.126 region:rollup2
BRING MY SON IN FOR HIS. REGULAR

04:26:13.858 --> 04:26:17.228 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CHECK OF EVERY YEAR

04:26:15.126 --> 04:26:18.696 region:rollup2
THEY SERVE THE SWING THE NOT

04:26:17.228 --> 04:26:20.231 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE PATIENT WHAT THEY

04:26:18.696 --> 04:26:22.433 region:rollup2
USE TO THERE'S JUST SO MUCH

04:26:20.231 --> 04:26:23.434 region:rollup2
PAPERWORK. SO MUCH BUREAUCRACY

04:26:22.433 --> 04:26:26.103 region:rollup2
THAT WE WE HAVE NO MATTER WHAT

04:26:23.434 --> 04:26:27.839 region:rollup2
WE DO WE HAVE TO CUT THAT AND

04:26:26.103 --> 04:26:29.974 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M.

04:26:27.839 --> 04:26:30.575 region:rollup2
I I'M GLAD THAT THIS WAS BROACH

04:26:29.974 --> 04:26:32.109 region:rollup2
THAT THE HEARING HAS IT'S BEEN

04:26:30.575 --> 04:26:32.543 region:rollup2
ONE OF MY FRUSTRATIONS OVER WAY

04:26:32.109 --> 04:26:34.078 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

04:26:32.543 --> 04:26:35.479 region:rollup2
.

04:26:34.078 --> 04:26:37.715 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT

04:26:35.479 --> 04:26:40.017 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA DO ABOUT. THOSE THAT

04:26:37.715 --> 04:26:41.419 region:rollup2
PAPERWORK SHUFFLE BUT OKAY.

04:26:40.017 --> 04:26:43.254 region:rollup2
REALLY QUICKLY I'M THE OTHER

04:26:41.419 --> 04:26:43.588 region:rollup2
ISSUE IS.

04:26:43.254 --> 04:26:46.123 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:26:43.588 --> 04:26:47.291 region:rollup2
HOW CURRENTLY WAS SET UP WHEN

04:26:46.123 --> 04:26:48.960 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PATIENT COMING IN FOR

04:26:47.291 --> 04:26:51.195 region:rollup2
TREATMENT?

04:26:48.960 --> 04:26:52.063 region:rollup2
IF WE HAVE PATIENT A THEY

04:26:51.195 --> 04:26:54.265 region:rollup2
COMMAND.

04:26:52.063 --> 04:26:55.800 region:rollup2
PRESENTING WITH THE WHATEVER

04:26:54.265 --> 04:26:56.300 region:rollup2
THAT THEY.

04:26:55.800 --> 04:26:58.102 region:rollup2
DISEASE IS.

04:26:56.300 --> 04:26:59.403 region:rollup2
.

04:26:58.102 --> 04:27:01.973 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TOLD THEY NEED TO JUST

04:26:59.403 --> 04:27:03.040 region:rollup2
STEP THERAPY AND THEY FAIL.

04:27:01.973 --> 04:27:04.642 region:rollup2
THEN THE COMEBACK STEP THERAPY

04:27:03.040 --> 04:27:06.644 region:rollup2
AND THEY FAIL.

04:27:04.642 --> 04:27:08.479 region:rollup2
MEANWHILE THE PHYSICIAN ALREADY

04:27:06.644 --> 04:27:09.080 region:rollup2
KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT THEY'VE

04:27:08.479 --> 04:27:09.947 region:rollup2
GONE THROUGH YOU KNOW GETTING

04:27:09.080 --> 04:27:12.817 region:rollup2
DENIED.

04:27:09.947 --> 04:27:15.052 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE YEAR THE BUDGET YEAR

04:27:12.817 --> 04:27:16.454 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT WILL HOPEFULLY GET

04:27:15.052 --> 04:27:17.855 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PHYSICIAN WANTED IN THE

04:27:16.454 --> 04:27:19.156 region:rollup2
BEGINNING.

04:27:17.855 --> 04:27:20.825 region:rollup2
BUT MEANWHILE WHERE QUALITY OF

04:27:19.156 --> 04:27:22.526 region:rollup2
LIFE WAS LESS IF IT'S A

04:27:20.825 --> 04:27:24.495 region:rollup2
COMMUNICABLE DISEASE THERE'S YOU

04:27:22.526 --> 04:27:25.596 region:rollup2
KNOW THE VIRAL LOAD ISSUE IN THE

04:27:24.495 --> 04:27:27.698 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THERE'S

04:27:25.596 --> 04:27:29.500 region:rollup2
HOSPITALIZATION COSTS.

04:27:27.698 --> 04:27:31.736 region:rollup2
GETTING A HANDLE ON WHAT'S.

04:27:29.500 --> 04:27:33.504 region:rollup2
STEPPED THIRD BE FAILURES R. IS

04:27:31.736 --> 04:27:34.405 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE I'VE TRIED TO THE

04:27:33.504 --> 04:27:36.107 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

04:27:34.405 --> 04:27:38.743 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND OTHERS TO FIND OUT

04:27:36.107 --> 04:27:40.845 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A COST. PER PATIENT.

04:27:38.743 --> 04:27:43.514 region:rollup2
FOR EACH OF FAILURE OF THE STEP

04:27:40.845 --> 04:27:44.916 region:rollup2
THERAPY.

04:27:43.514 --> 04:27:46.584 region:rollup2
THAT'S A COSTS THOUGH IT'S A AND

04:27:44.916 --> 04:27:49.954 region:rollup2
IT'S OF THE WHOLE BUREAUCRACY.

04:27:46.584 --> 04:27:51.455 region:rollup2
.

04:27:49.954 --> 04:27:53.324 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION IT UP WE IF WE LOOK

04:27:51.455 --> 04:27:54.559 region:rollup2
TOWARD INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICINE

04:27:53.324 --> 04:27:56.027 region:rollup2
OR VALUE ADDED HEALTH CARE AND

04:27:54.559 --> 04:27:57.662 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I HOPE CAN BE PART

04:27:56.027 --> 04:27:59.230 region:rollup2
OF THIS DISCUSSION.

04:27:57.662 --> 04:28:00.231 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME IS THERE AND THIS

04:27:59.230 --> 04:28:01.799 region:rollup2
IS THE QUESTION IS THERE SOME

04:28:00.231 --> 04:28:03.467 region:rollup2
TRUTH.

04:28:01.799 --> 04:28:06.170 region:rollup2
TO THE IDEA OF GETTING THE BEST

04:28:03.467 --> 04:28:11.576 region:rollup2
CARE UP FRONT.

04:28:06.170 --> 04:28:13.411 region:rollup2
REALIZE SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN.

04:28:11.576 --> 04:28:14.312 region:rollup2
ISN'T IT PART OF THIS EQUATION.

04:28:13.411 --> 04:28:15.713 region:rollup2
YEAH MAN I THINK ONE OF THE

04:28:14.312 --> 04:28:16.914 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WOULD THE FRAGMENTED

04:28:15.713 --> 04:28:18.583 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY IS

04:28:16.914 --> 04:28:21.319 region:rollup2
THAT IF THERE ARE KIND OF LONG

04:28:18.583 --> 04:28:22.687 region:rollup2
RUN DOWNSTREAM BENEFITS. THOSE

04:28:21.319 --> 04:28:23.888 region:rollup2
IN A MAY ACCRUE NOT TO THE KIND

04:28:22.687 --> 04:28:25.122 region:rollup2
OF PAYER THAT HAS TO MAKE THE

04:28:23.888 --> 04:28:26.190 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS UP FRONT RIGHT AND

04:28:25.122 --> 04:28:27.725 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU IMAGINE SOMETHING

04:28:26.190 --> 04:28:29.360 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO REDUCE YOUR COST

04:28:27.725 --> 04:28:29.961 region:rollup2
OF CARE WHEN YOU'RE SEVENTY

04:28:29.360 --> 04:28:30.995 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BENEFIT THAT ACCRUES

04:28:29.961 --> 04:28:33.097 region:rollup2
TO.

04:28:30.995 --> 04:28:34.231 region:rollup2
YOU AS A MEDICARE PATIENT BUT IF

04:28:33.097 --> 04:28:35.967 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIRES TREATMENT AT THE

04:28:34.231 --> 04:28:37.468 region:rollup2
AGE OF FIFTY THAT'S A COST THAT

04:28:35.967 --> 04:28:39.136 region:rollup2
OCCURS TO YOUR YOUR CURRENT

04:28:37.468 --> 04:28:40.071 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS NOT.

04:28:39.136 --> 04:28:41.405 region:rollup2
GENERALLY THE MEDICARE PROGRAM

04:28:40.071 --> 04:28:42.707 region:rollup2
MADE AND SO THERE IS CERTAINLY

04:28:41.405 --> 04:28:44.909 region:rollup2
SOME.

04:28:42.707 --> 04:28:45.910 region:rollup2
HAD A MISALIGNMENT OF THE TIMING

04:28:44.909 --> 04:28:47.144 region:rollup2
OF THE KIND OF FINANCING OR

04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:48.713 region:rollup2
FUNDING OF HEALTHCARE AND THE

04:28:47.144 --> 04:28:50.181 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM BENEFITS

04:28:48.713 --> 04:28:51.749 region:rollup2
THAT CREATES THESE. AYE

04:28:50.181 --> 04:28:53.517 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN INCENTIVES THAT

04:28:51.749 --> 04:28:54.819 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED AND I THINK YOU

04:28:53.517 --> 04:28:56.821 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF A.

04:28:54.819 --> 04:28:58.823 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE COMPONENT OF THE

04:28:56.821 --> 04:28:59.890 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THAT THIS SYSTEM IS

04:28:58.823 --> 04:29:01.192 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY STRUCTURED THAT DOES

04:28:59.890 --> 04:29:02.927 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

04:29:01.192 --> 04:29:03.427 region:rollup2
ARE NOT IN PLACE TO INVEST IN IN

04:29:02.927 --> 04:29:04.962 region:rollup2
LONG TERM.

04:29:03.427 --> 04:29:06.697 region:rollup2
IN CARE THAT HAS LONG TERM

04:29:04.962 --> 04:29:08.666 region:rollup2
BENEFITS I'M AT LEAST FROM THE

04:29:06.697 --> 04:29:10.067 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF

04:29:08.666 --> 04:29:10.968 region:rollup2
INSURERS.

04:29:10.067 --> 04:29:11.202 region:rollup2
THE MORE CHURN YOU HAVE AN

04:29:10.968 --> 04:29:13.270 region:rollup2
ASSIST.

04:29:11.202 --> 04:29:13.838 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THE MORE THAT THAT

04:29:13.270 --> 04:29:14.872 region:rollup2
PROBLEM GETS EXACERBATED AS

04:29:13.838 --> 04:29:16.073 region:rollup2
WELL.

04:29:14.872 --> 04:29:17.775 region:rollup2
EXACTLY IF PEOPLE AREN'T STAYING

04:29:16.073 --> 04:29:19.443 region:rollup2
ON A PLAN.

04:29:17.775 --> 04:29:20.511 region:rollup2
LONG ENOUGH LONG TERM THEN THEY

04:29:19.443 --> 04:29:23.214 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

04:29:20.511 --> 04:29:24.181 region:rollup2
COVER THEM OVER TIME WHEN THAT.

04:29:23.214 --> 04:29:26.784 region:rollup2
IN A LIVER TRANSPLANT OR

04:29:24.181 --> 04:29:28.586 region:rollup2
WHATEVER HITS.

04:29:26.784 --> 04:29:29.720 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S AN ISSUE AND I FEEL

04:29:28.586 --> 04:29:31.288 region:rollup2
LIKE WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS

04:29:29.720 --> 04:29:32.690 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE IN THE END THIS THE

04:29:31.288 --> 04:29:33.491 region:rollup2
PATIENTS A FALLING THROUGH THE

04:29:32.690 --> 04:29:35.359 region:rollup2
CRACKS AND SUFFERING.

04:29:33.491 --> 04:29:36.827 region:rollup2
.

04:29:35.359 --> 04:29:38.329 region:rollup2
AND THEN JUST REALLY QUICKLY THE

04:29:36.827 --> 04:29:40.998 region:rollup2
LAST THING IS WHERE DOES

04:29:38.329 --> 04:29:42.800 region:rollup2
INNOVATION FALL ANALYSTS.

04:29:40.998 --> 04:29:45.569 region:rollup2
IF WE COULD HAVE YOU KNOW.

04:29:42.800 --> 04:29:47.071 region:rollup2
THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND DATA

04:29:45.569 --> 04:29:47.605 region:rollup2
DRIVEN CARE OF THE ONLY THINGS

04:29:47.071 --> 04:29:49.140 region:rollup2
THAT WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT

04:29:47.605 --> 04:29:50.241 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

04:29:49.140 --> 04:29:51.108 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THAT NO

04:29:50.241 --> 04:29:54.078 region:rollup2
MATTER WHAT SYSTEM WE END UP

04:29:51.108 --> 04:29:55.613 region:rollup2
WITH.

04:29:54.078 --> 04:30:00.117 region:rollup2
THIS I THINK IT'LL CREATE COST

04:29:55.613 --> 04:30:02.486 region:rollup2
SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN.

04:30:00.117 --> 04:30:04.622 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

04:30:02.486 --> 04:30:05.189 region:rollup2
WITHOUT AMOUNTS TO REALLY COOK

04:30:04.622 --> 04:30:06.424 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS IF I CAN FIRST DR

04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:08.125 region:rollup2
TRISH.

04:30:06.424 --> 04:30:09.927 region:rollup2
IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO MOVE TO A

04:30:08.125 --> 04:30:11.862 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER OR TO AND ALL PAYER

04:30:09.927 --> 04:30:12.963 region:rollup2
RATE SETTING SYSTEM.

04:30:11.862 --> 04:30:14.665 region:rollup2
DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH

04:30:12.963 --> 04:30:16.467 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IN THE COST REPORTS

04:30:14.665 --> 04:30:18.202 region:rollup2
AND DISCHARGE DATA FILED ITH

04:30:16.467 --> 04:30:20.838 region:rollup2
THE HARSH PAD. TO EFFECTIVELY

04:30:18.202 --> 04:30:21.672 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE HOSPITAL BUDGET AND

04:30:20.838 --> 04:30:23.574 region:rollup2
SET PROVIDER RATE PAYMENT.

04:30:21.672 --> 04:30:26.811 region:rollup2
RATES.

04:30:23.574 --> 04:30:28.813 region:rollup2
AND WHAT DATA AND CONSIDERATIONS

04:30:26.811 --> 04:30:30.981 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT TO HELP

04:30:28.813 --> 04:30:32.850 region:rollup2
MANAGE YOUR TWO YEAR INFLATION.

04:30:30.981 --> 04:30:35.152 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

04:30:32.850 --> 04:30:38.456 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ABRUPT DISRUPTIONS IN

04:30:35.152 --> 04:30:39.724 region:rollup2
INCOME FOR PROVIDERS.

04:30:38.456 --> 04:30:40.758 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I

04:30:39.724 --> 04:30:42.126 region:rollup2
MEAN I THINK THERE MAY BE

04:30:40.758 --> 04:30:43.160 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES THAT ARE

04:30:42.126 --> 04:30:44.662 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO YOU KIND OF THE

04:30:43.160 --> 04:30:45.663 region:rollup2
STATE OR STATE GOVERNMENTS BUT

04:30:44.662 --> 04:30:47.264 region:rollup2
AT LEAST FROM A RESEARCHERS

04:30:45.663 --> 04:30:49.433 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE I WOULD SAY WE DON'T

04:30:47.264 --> 04:30:51.602 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ADEQUATE DATA TO FULLY.

04:30:49.433 --> 04:30:53.237 region:rollup2
KINDA COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTAND

04:30:51.602 --> 04:30:54.505 region:rollup2
WHAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE

04:30:53.237 --> 04:30:56.774 region:rollup2
GETTING PAID ACROSS THE FULL

04:30:54.505 --> 04:30:57.842 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM OF DIFFERENT PAYERS AND

04:30:56.774 --> 04:30:58.976 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL PLANS

04:30:57.842 --> 04:31:00.644 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN PARTICULAR IN THE

04:30:58.976 --> 04:31:02.613 region:rollup2
CASE OF. OTHER COMMERCIAL

04:31:00.644 --> 04:31:03.714 region:rollup2
INSURERS. THESE NEGOTIATED RATES

04:31:02.613 --> 04:31:04.849 region:rollup2
ARE CONSIDERED KIND OF

04:31:03.714 --> 04:31:06.250 region:rollup2
PROPRIETARY.

04:31:04.849 --> 04:31:08.152 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW INFORMATION OR

04:31:06.250 --> 04:31:09.820 region:rollup2
PROPRIETARY RATES AND SO THERE

04:31:08.152 --> 04:31:11.922 region:rollup2
ARE SOME DATA SOURCES AVAILABLE

04:31:09.820 --> 04:31:13.457 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE NOT COMPREHENSIVE IN

04:31:11.922 --> 04:31:15.025 region:rollup2
IN THE HARSH THE OSCAR DATA IS A

04:31:13.457 --> 04:31:16.861 region:rollup2
GREAT SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON.

04:31:15.025 --> 04:31:19.163 region:rollup2
KENNY UTILIZATION OF IN PATIENT

04:31:16.861 --> 04:31:21.298 region:rollup2
AND EDIE CARE BUT YOU CAN HAVE

04:31:19.163 --> 04:31:22.766 region:rollup2
TO TO ESTIMATE THE PAYMENTS THAT

04:31:21.298 --> 04:31:25.236 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS GET PAID THE ACTUAL

04:31:22.766 --> 04:31:26.737 region:rollup2
DATA IS NOT INCLUDED IN IN THAT

04:31:25.236 --> 04:31:28.038 region:rollup2
DATA SAID.

04:31:26.737 --> 04:31:28.773 region:rollup2
AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT THIS.

04:31:28.038 --> 04:31:30.407 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A.

04:31:28.773 --> 04:31:31.242 region:rollup2
STRAIGHTFORWARD SIMPLE ANSWER

04:31:30.407 --> 04:31:32.243 region:rollup2
AND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

04:31:31.242 --> 04:31:34.278 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL DOWNSTREAM

04:31:32.243 --> 04:31:36.180 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS OF AND OF WORKFORCE

04:31:34.278 --> 04:31:37.181 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS AND ACCESS AND I

04:31:36.180 --> 04:31:39.984 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

04:31:37.181 --> 04:31:41.652 region:rollup2
MORE BROADLY MAKING AVAILABLE

04:31:39.984 --> 04:31:42.253 region:rollup2
ON DATA TO STUDY THESE TYPES OF

04:31:41.652 --> 04:31:43.220 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS YOU KNOW THERE ARE

04:31:42.253 --> 04:31:44.588 region:rollup2
SOME GREAT.

04:31:43.220 --> 04:31:46.423 region:rollup2
ECONOMISTS OUT THERE THERE ARE

04:31:44.588 --> 04:31:47.758 region:rollup2
SOME GREAT MODELERS OF KIND OF

04:31:46.423 --> 04:31:50.361 region:rollup2
PREDICTING FUTURE PROVIDER

04:31:47.758 --> 04:31:50.995 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR OF PREDICTING CONSUMER

04:31:50.361 --> 04:31:51.695 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND

04:31:50.995 --> 04:31:53.063 region:rollup2
SO.

04:31:51.695 --> 04:31:54.698 region:rollup2
BETTER DATA AND SOME KIND OF

04:31:53.063 --> 04:31:56.934 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN ANALYTICS CAN

04:31:54.698 --> 04:31:58.602 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW INFORM THESE

04:31:56.934 --> 04:32:00.337 region:rollup2
TYPES OF A DECISIONS AND SETTING

04:31:58.602 --> 04:32:02.573 region:rollup2
RATES.

04:32:00.337 --> 04:32:04.675 region:rollup2
SO OFFLINE I'D LIKE IF YOU COULD

04:32:02.573 --> 04:32:06.010 region:rollup2
TO HELP MY OFFICE FIGURE OUT

04:32:04.675 --> 04:32:07.845 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE DATA POINTS ARE SO

04:32:06.010 --> 04:32:09.747 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK ON

04:32:07.845 --> 04:32:11.048 region:rollup2
THAT BUT WANT TO DO IT. AT A

04:32:09.747 --> 04:32:12.449 region:rollup2
TIME WHEN WE HAVE MORE IF OKAY

04:32:11.048 --> 04:32:14.351 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU IF I CAN ASK

04:32:12.449 --> 04:32:17.621 region:rollup2
DOCTOR BAKER TO WHAT EXTENT CAN

04:32:14.351 --> 04:32:19.023 region:rollup2
EXISTING ANTI TRUST LAWS BE USED

04:32:17.621 --> 04:32:20.457 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY TO COMBAT.

04:32:19.023 --> 04:32:22.259 region:rollup2
THE ANTI COMPETITIVE EFFECTS OF

04:32:20.457 --> 04:32:24.061 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION

04:32:22.259 --> 04:32:25.863 region:rollup2
AND WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

04:32:24.061 --> 04:32:26.964 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF STATE PURSES FEDERAL

04:32:25.863 --> 04:32:29.600 region:rollup2
LAW AND POLICY IN ACCOMPLISHING

04:32:26.964 --> 04:32:32.102 region:rollup2
THIS GOAL.

04:32:29.600 --> 04:32:35.072 region:rollup2
AB AND IT SHORT ANSWERS BE

04:32:32.102 --> 04:32:35.706 region:rollup2
INCOMPLETE IN SOME SENSE SO I'M.

04:32:35.072 --> 04:32:37.775 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAWS CAN BE HELPFUL THE

04:32:35.706 --> 04:32:39.176 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

04:32:37.775 --> 04:32:41.045 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AT THE

04:32:39.176 --> 04:32:43.080 region:rollup2
MOMENT DISTINCT INCLUDE THAT

04:32:41.045 --> 04:32:44.915 region:rollup2
SHEER NUMBER OF MERGERS AN

04:32:43.080 --> 04:32:46.617 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY THAT THE FTC IN THE DOJ

04:32:44.915 --> 04:32:46.851 region:rollup2
TRY TO MONITOR.

04:32:46.617 --> 04:32:48.519 region:rollup2
AND SO.

04:32:46.851 --> 04:32:49.787 region:rollup2
.

04:32:48.519 --> 04:32:51.155 region:rollup2
TO SOME EXTENT STATES TAKING AN

04:32:49.787 --> 04:32:53.123 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN THEIR OWN CONCERNS

04:32:51.155 --> 04:32:54.592 region:rollup2
MAY BE USEFUL BECAUSE THEY JUST

04:32:53.123 --> 04:32:55.226 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO LOOK

04:32:54.592 --> 04:32:56.727 region:rollup2
AT EVERYTHING THAT'S OUT THEIR

04:32:55.226 --> 04:32:57.328 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THE LAW MIGHT ALLOW

04:32:56.727 --> 04:32:58.829 region:rollup2
THEM TO TAKE ON SOME OF THESE

04:32:57.328 --> 04:32:59.964 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

04:32:58.829 --> 04:33:01.765 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE

04:32:59.964 --> 04:33:03.467 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT LAWS

04:33:01.765 --> 04:33:05.669 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AS THEY.

04:33:03.467 --> 04:33:07.905 region:rollup2
AS THEY RELATE TO PHYSICIANS I

04:33:05.669 --> 04:33:09.840 region:rollup2
THINK SO I ONE OF THE ISSUES IS

04:33:07.905 --> 04:33:11.475 region:rollup2
JUST THIS THE.

04:33:09.840 --> 04:33:13.177 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITION OF A REVIEWABLE

04:33:11.475 --> 04:33:15.045 region:rollup2
EVENT I HAVE TO REACH A CERTAIN

04:33:13.177 --> 04:33:16.814 region:rollup2
SCALAR CERTAIN SIZE TO BE

04:33:15.045 --> 04:33:18.649 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND SO IF

04:33:16.814 --> 04:33:19.783 region:rollup2
YOU I'M. ARE A LARGE.

04:33:18.649 --> 04:33:21.151 region:rollup2
PROVIDER GROUP AND YOU START

04:33:19.783 --> 04:33:22.353 region:rollup2
MERGING WITH A COUPLE OF SMALL

04:33:21.151 --> 04:33:23.888 region:rollup2
ONE OR TWO PERSON PRACTICES

04:33:22.353 --> 04:33:25.890 region:rollup2
OFTEN THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT

04:33:23.888 --> 04:33:27.391 region:rollup2
REVIEWABLE. UNDER THE CURRENT

04:33:25.890 --> 04:33:29.126 region:rollup2
LAWS AND SO THERE ARE SOME SOME

04:33:27.391 --> 04:33:30.494 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH THE EXTENT TO WHICH

04:33:29.126 --> 04:33:31.362 region:rollup2
WE CAN USE THE CURRENT STRUCTURE

04:33:30.494 --> 04:33:33.364 region:rollup2
TO HANDLE SOME OF THE

04:33:31.362 --> 04:33:35.399 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION THAT'S BEEN GOING

04:33:33.364 --> 04:33:36.033 region:rollup2
ON. I'M YOUR SECOND QUESTION I

04:33:35.399 --> 04:33:36.900 region:rollup2
THINK IS WHAT CAN ASSIST WHAT

04:33:36.033 --> 04:33:38.702 region:rollup2
WERE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

04:33:36.900 --> 04:33:39.870 region:rollup2
STATE AND FEDERAL LIVE I THINK

04:33:38.702 --> 04:33:41.538 region:rollup2
THAT IS AN INTERESTING. AYE

04:33:39.870 --> 04:33:43.307 region:rollup2
ISSUE I'M NOT A. LAWYER AN

04:33:41.538 --> 04:33:44.775 region:rollup2
ANTITRUST LEGAL SCHOLAR CELLS

04:33:43.307 --> 04:33:47.077 region:rollup2
TRY TO STEER CLEAR OF GIVING YOU

04:33:44.775 --> 04:33:47.378 region:rollup2
REALLY DETAILED LEGAL ADVICE ON

04:33:47.077 --> 04:33:47.511 region:rollup2
THIS MATTER.

04:33:47.378 --> 04:33:49.079 region:rollup2
.

04:33:47.511 --> 04:33:50.547 region:rollup2
.

04:33:49.079 --> 04:33:51.482 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THERE ARE THIS THE

04:33:50.547 --> 04:33:54.652 region:rollup2
STATE CERTAINLY.

04:33:51.482 --> 04:33:56.020 region:rollup2
HAS A LICENSING ISSUE PLACE AND

04:33:54.652 --> 04:33:57.154 region:rollup2
SING AND OTHER COMPLIANCE

04:33:56.020 --> 04:33:58.656 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS OF HEALTHCARE

04:33:57.154 --> 04:34:00.424 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND THAT PROBABLY

04:33:58.656 --> 04:34:01.558 region:rollup2
GIVES IT SOME ABILITY TO LOOK AT

04:34:00.424 --> 04:34:03.494 region:rollup2
WHO'S MERGING AND WORKING

04:34:01.558 --> 04:34:04.094 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. THERE MAY BE OTHER

04:34:03.494 --> 04:34:06.063 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT STATES CAN DO AND

04:34:04.094 --> 04:34:07.464 region:rollup2
I'LL I'LL JUST NOT TRY TO SAY

04:34:06.063 --> 04:34:07.998 region:rollup2
ABOUT MY NOTE IT'S A CHALLENGING

THERE ARE WAYS FOR STATES TO DO

04:34:18.542 --> 04:34:20.010 region:rollup2
IT.

04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:21.545 region:rollup2
IT MAY BE.

A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE

A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE

04:35:14.932 --> 04:35:17.968 region:rollup2
SURVEY DONE BY CONSUMER REPORTS

04:35:16.533 --> 04:35:20.237 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR FOUND THAT HEALTH CARE

04:35:17.968 --> 04:35:21.805 region:rollup2
REMAINS THE TOP AND A GROWING

04:35:20.237 --> 04:35:23.340 region:rollup2
CONSUMER CONCERN OF ALL THE

04:35:21.805 --> 04:35:25.142 region:rollup2
SUBJECT AREAS WE STUDIED. ONE

04:35:23.340 --> 04:35:26.610 region:rollup2
KEY FINDING WAS THAT MORE THAN

04:35:25.142 --> 04:35:28.379 region:rollup2
HALF OF RESPONDENTS NATIONALLY

04:35:26.610 --> 04:35:29.680 region:rollup2
SAID THEY LACK CONFIDENCE THAT

04:35:28.379 --> 04:35:30.848 region:rollup2
THEY OR THEIR LOVED ONES WILL BE

04:35:29.680 --> 04:35:32.383 region:rollup2
ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE

04:35:30.848 --> 04:35:33.884 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE.

04:35:32.383 --> 04:35:34.785 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE PUBLIC CONFUSION

04:35:33.884 --> 04:35:36.520 region:rollup2
CREATED BY SOME.

04:35:34.785 --> 04:35:38.322 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ACTORS IN TWENTY

04:35:36.520 --> 04:35:40.023 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THE FACT IS THAT WE

04:35:38.322 --> 04:35:41.792 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE HUGE STRIDES. UP

04:35:40.023 --> 04:35:43.694 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY ON BROADENING ACCESS

04:35:41.792 --> 04:35:44.828 region:rollup2
TO COVERAGE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE

04:35:43.694 --> 04:35:45.896 region:rollup2
CARE ACT INTO THE MEDICAID

04:35:44.828 --> 04:35:47.297 region:rollup2
EXPANSION AND OF COURSE THE

04:35:45.896 --> 04:35:48.732 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

04:35:47.297 --> 04:35:50.300 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY STANDS OUT AMONG

04:35:48.732 --> 04:35:51.802 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S FOR ALL THE PROGRESS

04:35:50.300 --> 04:35:53.303 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE MADE HERE.

04:35:51.802 --> 04:35:56.140 region:rollup2
YES WE'VE HEARD ALL DAY LONG.

04:35:53.303 --> 04:35:57.207 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES CERTAINLY REMAIN AND

04:35:56.140 --> 04:35:58.642 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DISCUSS A

04:35:57.207 --> 04:36:00.010 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THESE CHALLENGES FROM

04:35:58.642 --> 04:36:01.078 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE SUCH A

04:36:00.010 --> 04:36:02.379 region:rollup2
CHUNK THREE TODAY WE'RE GONNA

04:36:01.078 --> 04:36:03.180 region:rollup2
KEEP IT REALLY BRIEF BECAUSE I

04:36:02.379 --> 04:36:05.049 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS

04:36:03.180 --> 04:36:07.117 region:rollup2
WANNA GET THEIR COMMENTS.

04:36:05.049 --> 04:36:09.153 region:rollup2
FIRST JUST TO PRICES A CONSUMERS

04:36:07.117 --> 04:36:10.654 region:rollup2
PAY AND COST TO THE SYSTEM.

04:36:09.153 --> 04:36:11.889 region:rollup2
CONSUMER CONCERNS ABOUT COST

04:36:10.654 --> 04:36:13.857 region:rollup2
GETTING IN THE WAY OF GETTING

04:36:11.889 --> 04:36:15.025 region:rollup2
NEEDED CARE A DIMINISHED WITH

04:36:13.857 --> 04:36:16.960 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT YET

04:36:15.025 --> 04:36:18.796 region:rollup2
PREMIUM INCREASES. AND RISING

04:36:16.960 --> 04:36:20.564 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLES DO PRESENT BARRIERS

04:36:18.796 --> 04:36:22.299 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE COST OF COVERAGE AND

04:36:20.564 --> 04:36:23.834 region:rollup2
CARE UNAFFORDABLE FOR SOME

04:36:22.299 --> 04:36:25.836 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

04:36:23.834 --> 04:36:27.504 region:rollup2
COVERED CALIFORNIA'S MANAGED TO

04:36:25.836 --> 04:36:29.273 region:rollup2
MODERATE PREMIUM INCREASES ON

04:36:27.504 --> 04:36:30.407 region:rollup2
THE EXCHANGE ON AND OF COURSE

04:36:29.273 --> 04:36:32.042 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF EVEN THOSE

04:36:30.407 --> 04:36:32.409 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS HAS BEEN SOFTENED BY

04:36:32.042 --> 04:36:34.244 region:rollup2
THE.

04:36:32.409 --> 04:36:35.546 region:rollup2
PREMIUM TAX CREDITS THAT THE

04:36:34.244 --> 04:36:37.181 region:rollup2
VAST MAJORITY NEARLY NINETY

04:36:35.546 --> 04:36:37.648 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ENROLLEES THERE

04:36:37.181 --> 04:36:39.650 region:rollup2
RECEIVE.

04:36:37.648 --> 04:36:40.117 region:rollup2
BUT.

04:36:39.650 --> 04:36:42.519 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE.

04:36:40.117 --> 04:36:44.054 region:rollup2
ABOVE THAT INCOME LEVEL FOR THE

04:36:42.519 --> 04:36:45.222 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES AND FOR SOME BELOW

04:36:44.054 --> 04:36:46.356 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL IT IS STILL A

04:36:45.222 --> 04:36:48.025 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR HEALTH

04:36:46.356 --> 04:36:49.359 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN COSTS.

04:36:48.025 --> 04:36:50.861 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE UNDOCUMENTED

04:36:49.359 --> 04:36:53.096 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE

04:36:50.861 --> 04:36:54.364 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE SUBSIDIES AT ALL.

04:36:53.096 --> 04:36:55.699 region:rollup2
THERE'S A RANGE OF WAYS

04:36:54.364 --> 04:36:57.701 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE COVERAGE FOR

04:36:55.699 --> 04:36:59.903 region:rollup2
THOSE WITHOUT EMPLOYER INSURANCE

04:36:57.701 --> 04:37:01.371 region:rollup2
A AFFORDABLE AND WE URGE YOU TO

04:36:59.903 --> 04:37:03.407 region:rollup2
EXPLORE THEM IN THE COMING YEAR.

04:37:01.371 --> 04:37:05.642 region:rollup2
SHORT OF OUR PERHAPS GRANDEST

04:37:03.407 --> 04:37:07.911 region:rollup2
VISION OF FOR A SIMPLIFIED A

04:37:05.642 --> 04:37:09.546 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL CARE SYSTEM WE ARE TO

04:37:07.911 --> 04:37:11.114 region:rollup2
DO IN THE AYE EXPLORE ENHANCE

04:37:09.546 --> 04:37:12.216 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES FOR THOSE AT FOUR

04:37:11.114 --> 04:37:14.017 region:rollup2
HUNDRED OR JUST A LITTLE OVER

04:37:12.216 --> 04:37:15.319 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED AND AS WELL AS

04:37:14.017 --> 04:37:16.019 region:rollup2
THOSE UNDER.

04:37:15.319 --> 04:37:17.654 region:rollup2
THAT LIMIT.

04:37:16.019 --> 04:37:19.323 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL

04:37:17.654 --> 04:37:21.458 region:rollup2
AND CONSIDER PERHAPS CAPPING THE

04:37:19.323 --> 04:37:22.559 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE OF INCOME

04:37:21.458 --> 04:37:23.861 region:rollup2
THAT ANY CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE TO

04:37:22.559 --> 04:37:25.562 region:rollup2
PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE

04:37:23.861 --> 04:37:27.664 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS IN CALIFORNIA'S TWO

04:37:25.562 --> 04:37:28.999 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF THINGS TO LOOK AT.

04:37:27.664 --> 04:37:30.534 region:rollup2
IT'S TEMPTING JUST TO FOCUS ON

04:37:28.999 --> 04:37:31.802 region:rollup2
COST TO THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE

04:37:30.534 --> 04:37:33.137 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW WE REALLY FEEL THAT

04:37:31.802 --> 04:37:34.171 region:rollup2
OUR FAMILIES AND OURSELVES AND

04:37:33.137 --> 04:37:35.939 region:rollup2
OUR FRIENDS.

04:37:34.171 --> 04:37:37.341 region:rollup2
BUT UNDERLYING SYSTEM COSTS AS

04:37:35.939 --> 04:37:39.309 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD TODAY I'M ALSO

04:37:37.341 --> 04:37:40.277 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE IGNORED. ON THOSE

04:37:39.309 --> 04:37:42.145 region:rollup2
COSTS.

04:37:40.277 --> 04:37:43.113 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO THE UPWARD SPIRAL

04:37:42.145 --> 04:37:44.948 region:rollup2
BUT SPIRAL OF PREMIUMS

04:37:43.113 --> 04:37:46.316 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES IN THEY

04:37:44.948 --> 04:37:47.951 region:rollup2
SUPPRESS WORKERS WAGES.

04:37:46.316 --> 04:37:48.519 region:rollup2
IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED THAT A FOR

04:37:47.951 --> 04:37:50.053 region:rollup2
DECADES.

04:37:48.519 --> 04:37:51.355 region:rollup2
HEALTH EXPENDITURES IN THE

04:37:50.053 --> 04:37:53.624 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES HAVE GROWN AT A

04:37:51.355 --> 04:37:54.858 region:rollup2
MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN IN OTHER.

04:37:53.624 --> 04:37:56.093 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IN

04:37:54.858 --> 04:37:58.629 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE HIGH

04:37:56.093 --> 04:38:00.230 region:rollup2
PRICES NOT GREATER UTILIZATION

04:37:58.629 --> 04:38:01.398 region:rollup2
ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER.

04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:02.866 region:rollup2
US PAYS MORE THAN COMPARABLE

04:38:01.398 --> 04:38:03.800 region:rollup2
NATIONS FOR THE SAME HEALTH CARE

04:38:02.866 --> 04:38:05.702 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES SERVICES DRUGS AND

04:38:03.800 --> 04:38:06.937 region:rollup2
DEVICES.

04:38:05.702 --> 04:38:08.772 region:rollup2
AND WHILE PER CAPITA COSTS IN

04:38:06.937 --> 04:38:10.107 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OR LOWER THAN THE

04:38:08.772 --> 04:38:11.642 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE

04:38:10.107 --> 04:38:13.677 region:rollup2
PERSONAL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA

04:38:11.642 --> 04:38:14.878 region:rollup2
OVER FIVE TO TEN YEARS. I'M

04:38:13.677 --> 04:38:16.680 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GREW FASTER THAN THE

04:38:14.878 --> 04:38:18.682 region:rollup2
NATIONAL AVERAGE SO THE GAP

04:38:16.680 --> 04:38:20.117 region:rollup2
BETWEEN FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA.

04:38:18.682 --> 04:38:21.952 region:rollup2
ON PER CAPITA SPENDING IS

04:38:20.117 --> 04:38:23.787 region:rollup2
CLOSING BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY

04:38:21.952 --> 04:38:25.122 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL STILL GOING UPWARD.

04:38:23.787 --> 04:38:26.190 region:rollup2
POLICY MAKERS HAVE OF COURSE

04:38:25.122 --> 04:38:27.891 region:rollup2
TRIED A VARIETY.

04:38:26.190 --> 04:38:28.859 region:rollup2
OF APPROACHES TO SQUEEZE

04:38:27.891 --> 04:38:30.327 region:rollup2
GREATER VALUE OUT OF OUR

04:38:28.859 --> 04:38:31.628 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT IS

04:38:30.327 --> 04:38:33.197 region:rollup2
IMPROVE QUALITY WHILE ALSO

04:38:31.628 --> 04:38:34.264 region:rollup2
CONTAINING COSTS.

04:38:33.197 --> 04:38:35.098 region:rollup2
MAINLY THROUGH MARKET BASED

04:38:34.264 --> 04:38:36.700 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES AND SOMETIMES

04:38:35.098 --> 04:38:38.735 region:rollup2
PENALTIES.

04:38:36.700 --> 04:38:40.604 region:rollup2
WHILE THESE STEPS HAVE TEMPERED

04:38:38.735 --> 04:38:42.306 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN RECENT YEARS WE

04:38:40.604 --> 04:38:43.473 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO MORE.

04:38:42.306 --> 04:38:44.708 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NEEDS A FOCUSED

04:38:43.473 --> 04:38:46.643 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE

04:38:44.708 --> 04:38:47.211 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF RISING COSTS WITH

04:38:47.211 --> 04:38:51.081 region:rollup2
THEM.

04:38:49.613 --> 04:38:52.282 region:rollup2
STEPS THAT SOME OTHER INSTEAD OF

04:38:51.081 --> 04:38:53.684 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE TAKEN TO DO SO

04:38:52.282 --> 04:38:55.652 region:rollup2
INCLUDE CREATION OF A COST

LOT WHEAT I THINK WE DO NOT HAVE

THE DATA SO ANOTHER THING SOME

04:39:02.693 --> 04:39:06.630 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE DONE IS TO ESTABLISH

04:39:04.228 --> 04:39:08.232 region:rollup2
ALL PAYER. DATA BASES TO LEARN

04:39:06.630 --> 04:39:10.834 region:rollup2

04:40:38.989 --> 04:40:43.660 region:rollup2
PRETTY SHOCKING.

I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DISCUSS THE

04:43:16.112 --> 04:43:18.748 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY ISSUES FACED BY

04:43:17.447 --> 04:43:19.816 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS MOVING FROM ONE

04:43:18.748 --> 04:43:21.585 region:rollup2
PRODUCT TO ANOTHER WHAT WE'RE

04:43:19.816 --> 04:43:23.620 region:rollup2
NOW CALLING CHURN.

04:43:21.585 --> 04:43:24.955 region:rollup2
BUT FIRST TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT

04:43:23.620 --> 04:43:26.489 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN I

04:43:24.955 --> 04:43:28.058 region:rollup2
WAS A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY AT A

04:43:26.489 --> 04:43:29.826 region:rollup2
LOCAL HEALTH CONSUMER CENTER THE

04:43:28.058 --> 04:43:31.261 region:rollup2
BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE FACED

04:43:29.826 --> 04:43:33.263 region:rollup2
WAS THE POPULATION WE NOW CALL

04:43:31.261 --> 04:43:34.998 region:rollup2
THE EXPANSION ADULTS. NOT HAVING

04:43:33.263 --> 04:43:36.666 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO MEDICARE OUT AND

04:43:34.998 --> 04:43:37.901 region:rollup2
BASICALLY TELLING THEM THAT WE

04:43:36.666 --> 04:43:39.636 region:rollup2
HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE. NOT

04:43:37.901 --> 04:43:40.937 region:rollup2
CONDITION DETERIORATED TO SUCH

04:43:39.636 --> 04:43:41.972 region:rollup2
THE CASE THAT THEY QUALIFY FOR

04:43:40.937 --> 04:43:43.206 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL ON THE BASIS OF

04:43:41.972 --> 04:43:44.975 region:rollup2
DISABILITY.

04:43:43.206 --> 04:43:45.876 region:rollup2
AND THEN FOR THOSE JUST OVER

04:43:44.975 --> 04:43:48.545 region:rollup2
THAT INCOME LIMIT.

04:43:45.876 --> 04:43:49.679 region:rollup2
THIS SITUATION WAS JUSTICE DIRE

04:43:48.545 --> 04:43:50.847 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE NEEDING

04:43:49.679 --> 04:43:52.215 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE HAD A PRE EXISTING

04:43:50.847 --> 04:43:54.017 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS THAT THEY WERE EITHER

04:43:52.215 --> 04:43:55.886 region:rollup2
REFUSE CARE ENTIRELY ARE PRICED

04:43:54.017 --> 04:43:56.720 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE MARKET.

04:43:55.886 --> 04:43:58.154 region:rollup2
SO JUST LATER LEVEL FROM WHERE

04:43:56.720 --> 04:43:59.756 region:rollup2
WE'VE COME.

04:43:58.154 --> 04:44:01.024 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS A

04:43:59.756 --> 04:44:02.759 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KIND OF BEAST?

04:44:01.024 --> 04:44:04.361 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FIND NOW IS THAT FEW

04:44:02.759 --> 04:44:05.262 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS HAVE THE LUXURY OF

04:44:04.361 --> 04:44:06.763 region:rollup2
REMAINING WITH THE SAME HEALTH

04:44:05.262 --> 04:44:08.765 region:rollup2
PLAN AND HEALTH PROVIDERS

04:44:06.763 --> 04:44:10.433 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE? MANY LOW

04:44:08.765 --> 04:44:11.668 region:rollup2
INCOME CONSUMERS IN PARTICULAR

04:44:10.433 --> 04:44:12.836 region:rollup2
MOVE AMONG MEDI CAL COVER

04:44:11.668 --> 04:44:14.604 region:rollup2

UNSTABLE WORKING CONDITIONS.

04:44:16.473 --> 04:44:18.541 region:rollup2
THIS MOVEMENT THROUGH THE HEALTH

04:44:17.440 --> 04:44:20.610 region:rollup2
CARE MARKET BRINGS THE FOLLOWING

04:44:18.541 --> 04:44:22.145 region:rollup2
KINDS OF PROBLEMS.

04:44:20.610 --> 04:44:23.446 region:rollup2
WHEN CHOOSING A PLAN CONSUMERS

04:44:22.145 --> 04:44:25.448 region:rollup2

04:44:23.446 --> 04:44:26.583 region:rollup2
SOLVE A COMPLEX MATRIX TO ENSURE

04:44:28.118 --> 04:44:31.388 region:rollup2
SOME CONSUMERS MIGHT TRY TO STAY

04:44:42.766 --> 04:44:46.069 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY IN SOME AREAS JUST

04:44:44.701 --> 04:44:47.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS JOINED A%

04:44:46.069 --> 04:44:48.705 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PLAN THAT DOES NOT

04:44:47.671 --> 04:44:50.373 region:rollup2
MEAN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE

04:44:48.705 --> 04:44:51.574 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS IN THAT PLAN AS THE

04:44:50.373 --> 04:44:54.277 region:rollup2
PLANTS THEMSELVES ARE FURTHER

04:44:51.574 --> 04:44:55.612 region:rollup2
DIVIDED INTO PROVIDER SUBGROUPS.

04:44:54.277 --> 04:44:56.713 region:rollup2
MANY CONSUMERS ARE LEFT WITH THE

04:44:55.612 --> 04:44:57.948 region:rollup2
CHOICE OF WHO DO THEY LIKE

04:44:56.713 --> 04:44:59.950 region:rollup2
BETTER THEIR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR

04:44:57.948 --> 04:45:01.551 region:rollup2
OR THEIR ONCOLOGIST.

04:44:59.950 --> 04:45:02.619 region:rollup2
FURTHER COMPLICATING THE CHOICES

04:45:01.551 --> 04:45:03.920 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ALL PLANS IN THE

04:45:02.619 --> 04:45:05.722 region:rollup2
PRIVATE MARKET COVERED THE SAME

04:45:03.920 --> 04:45:07.190 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SO CONSUMERS

04:45:05.722 --> 04:45:08.792 region:rollup2
WHO NEED PARTICULAR MEDICATIONS

04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:10.427 region:rollup2
MUST COMPARE DRUG FORMULARIES TO

04:45:08.792 --> 04:45:12.262 region:rollup2
PICK THE RIGHT PLAN.

04:45:10.427 --> 04:45:13.396 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM COMPARE WE EVEN

04:45:12.262 --> 04:45:15.398 region:rollup2
READ A DRUG FORMULARY I FIND IT

04:45:13.396 --> 04:45:16.866 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT MYSELF.

04:45:15.398 --> 04:45:18.001 region:rollup2
AGAIN WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER THE

04:45:16.866 --> 04:45:20.236 region:rollup2
RIGHT MEDICATION OR STAINED WITH

04:45:18.001 --> 04:45:21.738 region:rollup2
THE PREFERRED DOCTOR.

04:45:20.236 --> 04:45:23.306 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN PREMIUM PRICE CAN

04:45:21.738 --> 04:45:25.041 region:rollup2
ALSO REQUIRE CONSUMERS TO CHANGE

04:45:23.306 --> 04:45:26.176 region:rollup2
PLANS EVERY YEAR IN BOTH THE

04:45:25.041 --> 04:45:27.410 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER MARKET AND THE

04:45:26.176 --> 04:45:29.212 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL MARKET THE CHEAPEST

04:45:27.410 --> 04:45:29.846 region:rollup2
PLAN AVAILABLE TO A GIVEN

04:45:29.212 --> 04:45:31.181 region:rollup2
CONSUMER CAN CHANGE FROM YEAR TO

04:45:29.846 --> 04:45:32.582 region:rollup2
YEAR.

04:45:31.181 --> 04:45:34.250 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PLANS ARE EXPENSIVE TO

04:45:32.582 --> 04:45:34.884 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH MANY CONSUMERS MAY

04:45:34.250 --> 04:45:36.286 region:rollup2
SHOP EVERY YEAR TO FIND THE BEST

04:45:34.884 --> 04:45:37.387 region:rollup2

04:45:36.286 --> 04:45:38.855 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE PREMIUM PRICE

04:45:37.387 --> 04:45:40.624 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS ALSO REQUIRED AB

04:45:38.855 --> 04:45:42.158 region:rollup2

GIVEN SERVICE WHEN A DEDUCTIBLE

04:45:45.161 --> 04:45:47.931 region:rollup2
APPLIES WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

04:45:46.062 --> 04:45:48.965 region:rollup2
BETWEEN A CO PANICO INSURANCE.

04:45:47.931 --> 04:45:50.266 region:rollup2

04:45:48.965 --> 04:45:52.135 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE REQUIRED TO PAY IN

04:45:50.266 --> 04:45:53.436 region:rollup2
ANY GIVEN YEAR.

04:45:52.135 --> 04:45:54.738 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION CHANGES IN A

04:45:53.436 --> 04:45:56.106 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS INCOME CAN CAUSE

04:45:54.738 --> 04:45:57.540 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE BETWEEN MEDI

04:45:59.342 --> 04:46:01.444 region:rollup2
FOR MANY PEOPLE THESE

04:46:00.143 --> 04:46:03.046 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONS ARE NOT SEEM LESS

04:46:01.444 --> 04:46:04.647 region:rollup2
AND RESULT MONTHS OF OVERLAPPING

04:46:03.046 --> 04:46:06.249 region:rollup2
COVERAGE CAUSING CONFUSION WHEN

04:46:04.647 --> 04:46:07.784 region:rollup2
THEY GO TO GET SERVICES AND IN

04:46:06.249 --> 04:46:09.185 region:rollup2
SOME CASES REQUIRING LOW INCOME

04:46:07.784 --> 04:46:10.854 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS TO CONTINUE PAYING

04:46:09.185 --> 04:46:13.056 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS THAT THEY DO NOT

04:46:10.854 --> 04:46:14.257 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY OWN CANNOT AFFORD.

04:46:13.056 --> 04:46:15.659 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN A PLANTS PROVIDER

04:46:14.257 --> 04:46:17.127 region:rollup2
NETWORK CAN ALSO FORCE PLAN

04:46:15.659 --> 04:46:18.662 region:rollup2
CHANGES SUCH AS WHEN ONE MEDI

FINALLY WHETHER IN MEDI CAL ON

04:46:25.502 --> 04:46:28.872 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURANCE CONSUMERS.

04:46:27.737 --> 04:46:30.473 region:rollup2
WHO KNOW THEY WILL BE CHANGING

04:46:28.872 --> 04:46:32.175 region:rollup2
PLANS GENERALLY CANNOT WORK WITH

04:46:30.473 --> 04:46:33.677 region:rollup2
THEIR NEW PLAN AHEAD OF TIME TO

04:46:32.175 --> 04:46:35.445 region:rollup2
SET APPOINTMENTS GET PROPER

04:46:33.677 --> 04:46:37.414 region:rollup2
REFERRALS TO SPECIALISTS ARRANGE

04:46:35.445 --> 04:46:38.581 region:rollup2
FOR PRESCRIPTION REFILLS?

04:46:37.414 --> 04:46:40.050 region:rollup2
THEY MUST WAIT UNTIL THEIR PLAN

04:46:38.581 --> 04:46:42.052 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IS ACTIVE BEFORE

04:46:40.050 --> 04:46:43.019 region:rollup2
ARRANGING FOR THE SERVICES.

04:46:42.052 --> 04:46:44.454 region:rollup2
WELL THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A

04:46:43.019 --> 04:46:45.955 region:rollup2
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO GO

04:46:44.454 --> 04:46:47.323 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ACCESS TO CARE FOR

04:46:45.955 --> 04:46:49.259 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH HIGH MEDICAL NEEDS

04:46:47.323 --> 04:46:50.093 region:rollup2
TO DISRUPTIONS CAN BE DANGEROUS.

04:46:49.259 --> 04:46:51.394 region:rollup2
AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THOSE

04:46:50.093 --> 04:46:52.429 region:rollup2
DISRUPTIONS ARE OCCURRING MORE

04:46:51.394 --> 04:46:54.831 region:rollup2
AND MORE FREQUENTLY AS A BOUNCE

04:46:52.429 --> 04:46:56.066 region:rollup2
TO THE SYSTEM.

04:46:54.831 --> 04:46:58.134 region:rollup2
NOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT

04:46:56.066 --> 04:46:58.401 region:rollup2
ONE EASY SOLUTION TO THIS

04:46:58.134 --> 04:47:00.670 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

04:46:58.401 --> 04:47:02.472 region:rollup2
WHILE PERSONALLY I WOULD LOVE A

04:47:00.670 --> 04:47:04.207 region:rollup2
SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THE CURRENT

04:47:02.472 --> 04:47:05.742 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEFORE US IS

04:47:04.207 --> 04:47:07.777 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON A DISCRETIONARY

04:47:05.742 --> 04:47:09.612 region:rollup2
FEDERAL WAIVER OF MEDICARE AND

04:47:07.777 --> 04:47:11.514 region:rollup2
MEDICAID LAW.

04:47:09.612 --> 04:47:13.016 region:rollup2
THE FORDS FINANCING AND LAST

04:47:11.514 --> 04:47:15.018 region:rollup2
WEEK THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

04:47:13.016 --> 04:47:16.086 region:rollup2
MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT IT

04:47:15.018 --> 04:47:17.887 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE GRANTING ANY

04:47:16.086 --> 04:47:19.355 region:rollup2
WAIVERS EXPANDING ACCESS TO

04:47:17.887 --> 04:47:20.990 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE. INSTEAD IT WOULD

04:47:19.355 --> 04:47:22.192 region:rollup2
LOOK TO GRANT WAIVERS

04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:23.793 region:rollup2
RESTRICTING ACCESS TO HEALTH

04:47:22.192 --> 04:47:25.528 region:rollup2
CARE BY IMPOSING ADDITIONAL

04:47:23.793 --> 04:47:27.731 region:rollup2
BURDENS ON PEOPLE SUCH AS WORK

04:47:25.528 --> 04:47:29.599 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS. PREMIUMS AND LOCK

04:47:27.731 --> 04:47:30.934 region:rollup2
OUT PERIODS AND THEY DID JUST

04:47:29.599 --> 04:47:31.935 region:rollup2
THAT AND GRANTING CAN'T THE

04:47:30.934 --> 04:47:33.536 region:rollup2
STATE OF KENTUCKY JUST SUCH A

04:47:31.935 --> 04:47:34.871 region:rollup2
WAIVER.

04:47:33.536 --> 04:47:36.606 region:rollup2
THIS MOVES US AWAY FROM OUR

04:47:34.871 --> 04:47:37.907 region:rollup2
SHARED GOAL OF GUARANTEED ACCESS

04:47:36.606 --> 04:47:39.676 region:rollup2
TO HEALTH CARE AND BACK TOWARDS

04:47:37.907 --> 04:47:40.944 region:rollup2
ONLY CARE FOR THOSE WHO CAN PAY

04:47:39.676 --> 04:47:42.712 region:rollup2
FOR IT OR THOSE WHO DESERVE IT.

04:47:40.944 --> 04:47:44.214 region:rollup2
.

04:47:42.712 --> 04:47:45.381 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SPENT

04:47:44.214 --> 04:47:47.484 region:rollup2
YEARS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT

04:47:45.381 --> 04:47:49.185 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE REFORM WE KNOW IT'S

04:47:47.484 --> 04:47:50.653 region:rollup2
NOT EASY WE KNOW WE CAN GET

04:47:49.185 --> 04:47:51.921 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WE WANT IMMEDIATELY

04:47:50.653 --> 04:47:53.256 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE ALSO WAYS TO

04:47:51.921 --> 04:47:55.625 region:rollup2
IMPROVE FRAGMENTATION.

04:47:53.256 --> 04:47:57.227 region:rollup2
ONE EXAMPLE.

04:47:55.625 --> 04:47:58.461 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR ANTHEM BLUE CROSS

04:47:57.227 --> 04:47:59.462 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD BE

04:47:58.461 --> 04:48:00.830 region:rollup2
LEAVING THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET

04:47:59.462 --> 04:48:02.565 region:rollup2
AND SUIT IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF

04:48:00.830 --> 04:48:03.700 region:rollup2
COVERED CALIFORNIA.

04:48:02.565 --> 04:48:05.435 region:rollup2
THIS HAD THE EFFECT OF

04:48:03.700 --> 04:48:06.336 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING OUR

04:48:05.435 --> 04:48:08.705 region:rollup2
ENTIRE MARKET ON COVERED

04:48:06.336 --> 04:48:10.006 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

04:48:08.705 --> 04:48:11.574 region:rollup2
CONSUMER ADVOCATES WORKED

04:48:10.006 --> 04:48:13.076 region:rollup2
QUICKLY WITH A LEGISLATOR TO

04:48:11.574 --> 04:48:14.544 region:rollup2
PASS SB ONE THIRTY THREE TO

04:48:13.076 --> 04:48:15.879 region:rollup2
EXPAND OUR CONTINUITY OF CARE

04:48:14.544 --> 04:48:17.480 region:rollup2
PROTECTION SO THAT THOSE WHO

04:48:15.879 --> 04:48:18.648 region:rollup2
WERE FORCED TO PICK A PLAN AND

04:48:17.480 --> 04:48:19.549 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF TREATMENT

04:48:18.648 --> 04:48:21.518 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO

04:48:19.549 --> 04:48:23.219 region:rollup2
FIND YOU PROVIDERS.

04:48:21.518 --> 04:48:24.721 region:rollup2
ANTHEM BLUE CROSS WORKED WITH

04:48:23.219 --> 04:48:26.489 region:rollup2
THE OTHER COVER CALIFORNIA PLANS

04:48:24.721 --> 04:48:28.691 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHICH PATIENT

04:48:26.489 --> 04:48:29.726 region:rollup2
RECORDS COULD BE TRANSMITTED TO

04:48:28.691 --> 04:48:31.194 region:rollup2
AVOID SOME OF THE MOST COMMON

04:48:29.726 --> 04:48:33.163 region:rollup2
DISRUPTIONS IN MOVING FROM ONE

04:48:31.194 --> 04:48:35.064 region:rollup2

04:48:33.163 --> 04:48:36.533 region:rollup2
CONSUMER ADVOCATES WORKED WITH

04:48:35.064 --> 04:48:37.700 region:rollup2
COVER CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT

04:48:36.533 --> 04:48:39.602 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS WOULD RECEIVE

04:48:37.700 --> 04:48:40.837 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE

04:48:39.602 --> 04:48:42.472 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND THAT THOSE WHO DID

04:48:40.837 --> 04:48:43.840 region:rollup2
NOT PICKING YOU PLAN WOULD BE

04:48:42.472 --> 04:48:46.109 region:rollup2
ASSIGNED TO A NEW PLAN AND NOT

04:48:43.840 --> 04:48:47.844 region:rollup2
GO WITHOUT COVERAGE.

04:48:46.109 --> 04:48:49.646 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S TOO SOON TO EVALUATE

04:48:47.844 --> 04:48:51.581 region:rollup2
HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT PROJECT HAS

04:48:49.646 --> 04:48:53.082 region:rollup2
BEEN. AND SO FAR WE'RE NOT

04:48:51.581 --> 04:48:54.751 region:rollup2
RECEIVING A WHOLE BUNCH OF CALLS

04:48:53.082 --> 04:48:55.785 region:rollup2
ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH IS THAT OUR

04:48:54.751 --> 04:48:57.120 region:rollup2
HEALTH CONSUMERS CENTERS BUT

04:48:55.785 --> 04:48:58.922 region:rollup2
WE'LL GIVE IT A FEW MORE WEEKS

04:48:57.120 --> 04:49:01.124 region:rollup2
TO SEE IF IT'S. ACTUALLY WORKED

04:48:58.922 --> 04:49:02.725 region:rollup2
OUT IT HAS CREATED A TESTING

04:49:01.124 --> 04:49:03.860 region:rollup2
GROUND FOR EASING DISRUPTIONS AT

04:49:02.725 --> 04:49:05.395 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS FACE WHEN CHANGING

04:49:03.860 --> 04:49:06.896 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

04:49:05.395 --> 04:49:08.731 region:rollup2
CONSUMER ADVOCATES HAVE ALREADY

04:49:06.896 --> 04:49:09.933 region:rollup2
BEAT BEGUN DISCUSSION DISCUSSING

04:49:08.731 --> 04:49:11.334 region:rollup2
OPTIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:49:09.933 --> 04:49:12.802 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

04:49:11.334 --> 04:49:14.237 region:rollup2
TO SEE IF SIMILAR PLANNING CAN

04:49:12.802 --> 04:49:15.872 region:rollup2
BE DONE IN COORDINATING CARED

04:49:14.237 --> 04:49:16.973 region:rollup2
FOR ENROLLEES MOVING FROM ONE

04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:23.479 region:rollup2
SO IN SHORT THE WORK OF

04:49:22.111 --> 04:49:25.582 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE

04:49:23.479 --> 04:49:26.649 region:rollup2
ACT IN THE CONTINUED REFORM OF

OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS NOT

POPULATIONS OF SENIORS. WE STILL

04:49:33.156 --> 04:49:36.559 region:rollup2
HAVE PEOPLE THAT CANNOT AFFORD

04:49:34.724 --> 04:49:37.560 region:rollup2
CARE EVEN WITH SUBSIDIES AND WE

04:49:36.559 --> 04:49:38.928 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT

04:49:37.560 --> 04:49:40.296 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES IN CREATING SEAMLESS

BROKEN ARM TO AN INSURANCE AGENT

05:07:59.328 --> 05:08:01.563 region:rollup2

ARRANGEMENTS.

05:13:45.807 --> 05:13:48.443 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR EFFORTS AMONGST MANY

05:13:46.841 --> 05:13:49.978 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

05:13:48.443 --> 05:13:51.112 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S NOW AT A RECORD

05:13:49.978 --> 05:13:52.480 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF HEALTH INSURANCE

05:13:51.112 --> 05:13:55.650 region:rollup2
COVERAGE WITH THE UNINSURED RATE

05:13:52.480 --> 05:13:56.484 region:rollup2
AT SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT.

05:13:55.650 --> 05:13:57.485 region:rollup2
THE LAST WHILE OF COURSE IS THE

05:13:56.484 --> 05:13:59.454 region:rollup2
HARDEST ONE WE STAND WITH THE

05:13:57.485 --> 05:14:01.389 region:rollup2

COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

05:14:01.389 --> 05:14:04.626 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS

05:14:02.724 --> 05:14:06.227 region:rollup2
ARE CURRENTLY HAPPY WITH THEIR

05:14:04.626 --> 05:14:07.829 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE COVERAGE BUT WE ALSO

05:14:06.227 --> 05:14:10.298 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT HAVING SOME WHO DONT

05:14:07.829 --> 05:14:12.834 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE ACCESS IS WRONG.

05:14:10.298 --> 05:14:13.968 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH.

05:14:12.834 --> 05:14:15.470 region:rollup2
WE URGE THE SELECT COMMITTEE OF

05:14:13.968 --> 05:14:16.738 region:rollup2

COM WHO BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD

05:14:37.692 --> 05:14:41.162 region:rollup2
NOT.

05:14:38.793 --> 05:14:42.197 region:rollup2
DISMANTLED THE EXCELLENT WORK

05:14:41.162 --> 05:14:43.832 region:rollup2

THESERIES OF HEARINGS.

05:15:14.863 --> 05:15:19.334 region:rollup2
EXCEPT FOR THE OBVIOUS MISSING

05:15:17.999 --> 05:15:21.669 region:rollup2
ELEMENT IN THEM AND THAT WOULD

05:15:19.334 --> 05:15:24.172 region:rollup2
BE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS

05:15:21.669 --> 05:15:25.940 region:rollup2
SPENT ON SINGLE PAYER AS AN

05:15:24.172 --> 05:15:27.642 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC AND AS A PATIENT CARE

05:15:25.940 --> 05:15:29.844 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

05:15:27.642 --> 05:15:31.813 region:rollup2
I AM A NURSE PRACTITIONER I'VE

05:15:29.844 --> 05:15:33.214 region:rollup2
BEEN A NURSE FOR FORTY THREE

05:15:31.813 --> 05:15:35.650 region:rollup2
YEARS A NURSE PRACTITIONER FOR

05:15:33.214 --> 05:15:37.418 region:rollup2
THIRTY NINE OF THOSE YEARS.

05:15:35.650 --> 05:15:39.754 region:rollup2
AND I WILL TELL YOU THERE'S

05:15:37.418 --> 05:15:41.489 region:rollup2
ANOTHER LITTLE SAME KIND ALIKE.

05:15:39.754 --> 05:15:43.591 region:rollup2
AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR

05:15:41.489 --> 05:15:45.326 region:rollup2
AWAY THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT

05:15:43.591 --> 05:15:47.429 region:rollup2
TO ALL OF YOU AND THAT IS. THE

05:15:45.326 --> 05:15:49.063 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING

05:15:47.429 --> 05:15:50.732 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER

05:15:49.063 --> 05:15:52.867 region:rollup2
AGAIN EXPECTING DIFFERENT

05:15:50.732 --> 05:15:55.036 region:rollup2
RESULTS.

05:15:52.867 --> 05:15:56.971 region:rollup2
MY ENTIRE PRACTICE LIFE HAS BEEN

05:15:55.036 --> 05:15:59.040 region:rollup2
SPENT.

05:15:56.971 --> 05:16:00.341 region:rollup2
PLAYING GAMES WITH TWEAKING THE

05:15:59.040 --> 05:16:03.077 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHICH IS ALL THAT WE

05:16:00.341 --> 05:16:05.146 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT CANNOT

05:16:03.077 --> 05:16:06.748 region:rollup2
WORK AND SHOULD NOT WORK.

05:16:05.146 --> 05:16:08.783 region:rollup2
I AM A CLINICIAN I AM NOT A

05:16:06.748 --> 05:16:12.787 region:rollup2
PROVIDER.

05:16:08.783 --> 05:16:14.222 region:rollup2
I GIVE PEOPLE CARE NOT PRODUCT.

05:16:12.787 --> 05:16:15.857 region:rollup2
AND MY PEOPLE WHO COME TO MY

05:16:14.222 --> 05:16:17.625 region:rollup2
CLINIC OUR PATIENTS NOT

05:16:15.857 --> 05:16:19.327 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS

05:16:17.625 --> 05:16:21.196 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MARKET PARADIGM FOR

05:16:19.327 --> 05:16:23.531 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE THAT SIMPLY NEEDS TO

05:16:21.196 --> 05:16:25.600 region:rollup2
GO AWAY.

05:16:23.531 --> 05:16:27.035 region:rollup2
I'LL CONTEST ONE NUMBER THAT I

05:16:25.600 --> 05:16:29.204 region:rollup2
HEARD TODAY AND THAT IS THE

05:16:27.035 --> 05:16:31.239 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COST DIFFERENCES

05:16:29.204 --> 05:16:33.374 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PRIVATE INSURANCE.

05:16:31.239 --> 05:16:35.743 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE

05:16:33.374 --> 05:16:37.345 region:rollup2
AND I'LL ALSO POINT OUT.

05:16:35.743 --> 05:16:39.247 region:rollup2
WE APPARENTLY ARE WE WASTING AT

05:16:37.345 --> 05:16:40.915 region:rollup2
LEAST SIX PERCENT OF OUR TAX

05:16:39.247 --> 05:16:41.916 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN MEDICARE TURNING IT

05:16:40.915 --> 05:16:43.518 region:rollup2
OVER TO PRIVATE INSURANCE

05:16:41.916 --> 05:16:45.787 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

05:16:43.518 --> 05:16:47.055 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE THE ADVANTAGE THAT WE

05:16:45.787 --> 05:16:47.589 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE WRITTEN AN TO THE

05:16:47.055 --> 05:16:49.891 region:rollup2
MEDICARE LAWS IN THE FIRST

05:16:47.589 --> 05:16:51.726 region:rollup2
PLACE.

05:16:49.891 --> 05:16:53.661 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE.

05:16:51.726 --> 05:16:56.631 region:rollup2
THAT I'M HEARING IN HEALTH

05:16:53.661 --> 05:16:58.500 region:rollup2
AFFAIRS MAGAZINE IN THE NEW

05:16:56.631 --> 05:17:00.201 region:rollup2
ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE. IN

05:17:00.201 --> 05:17:03.037 region:rollup2
MEDICAL ECONOMICS MAGAZINES OF

05:17:02.303 --> 05:17:05.273 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

05:17:03.037 --> 05:17:09.010 region:rollup2
COST.

05:17:05.273 --> 05:17:10.278 region:rollup2
IS TWENTY ONE PERCENT NOT ELEVEN

05:17:09.010 --> 05:17:12.514 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT

05:17:10.278 --> 05:17:14.415 region:rollup2
SAVING MONEY THERE'S A MUCH

05:17:12.514 --> 05:17:15.683 region:rollup2
BIGGER AMOUNT OF IT. AND I WILL

05:17:14.415 --> 05:17:18.753 region:rollup2
TELL YOU THAT THE SIMPLE

05:17:15.683 --> 05:17:19.954 region:rollup2
SOLUTION HERE IS A UNIVERSAL

05:17:18.753 --> 05:17:22.490 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SYSTEM WHERE THE.

05:25:47.762 --> 05:25:51.766 region:rollup2

HEALTH CARE OF COURSE IS A

05:25:58.572 --> 05:26:02.543 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. AND WE

05:26:00.608 --> 05:26:03.711 region:rollup2

THAT COST OF ATTAINING A

05:26:30.871 --> 05:26:33.541 region:rollup2
MEDICAL DEGREE BECAUSE WE SHOULD

05:26:32.373 --> 05:26:34.975 region:rollup2
