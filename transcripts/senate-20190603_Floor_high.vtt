IT TOOK DECADES FOR THE

00:20:58.724 --> 00:20:59.758
NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO BE

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.893
PASSED IT TOOK WOMEN WHO WERE

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.896
WILLING TO BE FORCE FED.

00:21:04.963 --> 00:21:06.398
WHEN THEY WERE IMPRISONED?

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:09.101
IN ORDER TO MAKE A STATEMENT AND

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:10.168
IT COST MANY OF THEM THEIR

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:12.504
HEALTH IN SHORT IN THEIR LIVES

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:13.839
BUT IT IS SO CRITICALLY

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:16.074
IMPORTANT IN A SOCIETY THAT

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.343
CLAIMS TO BE ONE THAT CELEBRATE

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.177
TO QUALITY.

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:21.213
IT CELEBRATES EQUAL RIGHTS FOR

ALL THAT WE'VE HAD THIS BATTLE

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.317
BUT THIS BATTLE IS ONLY JUST

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:27.653
BEGUN AS WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.354
PAST SEVERAL WEEKS.

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.556
THE EFFORT TO DENY WOMEN THERE

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.258
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN LIFE BY

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:35.727
CONTROLLING THEIR OWN BODIES IS

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.663
SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO BE A

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:38.997
CHALLENGE FOR US.

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:40.432
THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE STILL

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:42.067
NOT PAID EQUALLY FOR

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.369
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:47.339
WHETHER IT'S WOMEN OF COLOR OR

00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:48.206
JUST WOMEN.

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:49.941
OVERALL IN OUR SOCIETY WE HAVE

00:21:50.008 --> 00:21:52.177
NOT BEEN GIVEN THAT EQUALITY OF

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:53.979
OPPORTUNITY THAT IS OUR

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.914
BIRTHRIGHT THAT THE NINETEENTH

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.050
AMENDMENT REAFFIRMED WE ALSO

00:21:58.116 --> 00:21:59.618
FIND OURSELVES THE VICTIMS OF

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:01.186
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:03.355
IN THE WORKPLACE SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:04.923
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.725
WE ARE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:08.427
QUALITY BUT THE NINETEENTH

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:10.495
AMENDMENT BY THOSE THOUSANDS OF

00:22:10.562 --> 00:22:12.597

THAT I RISE ALSO TO CELEBRATE

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.241
THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:24.676
RECOGNIZING THAT WE STILL HAVE

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.078
AN EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT THAT

00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:27.145
WE NEED TO PASS.

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:29.347
AND EQUALITY IS STILL SOMETHING

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:31.717
THAT IS NOT QUITE WITHIN OUR

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.852
GRASP BUT WE GET CLOSER AND
