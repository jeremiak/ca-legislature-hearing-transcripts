THIS IS THE MEETING OF US UP FIVE PUBLIC SAFETY A BUDGET MEETING. AND. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO HAVE THOSE WHO ARE HERE TODAY I UNDERSTAND THAT. ON SOME OF THEM MAY BE ASSN WE GENERAL BACK TO TRY TO WAIT IN AND. WE CAN BEGIN THE INFORMATIONAL PIECE WHEN HE GETS HERE WE'LL. ESTABLISH A QUORUM OF BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH ISSUE ONE. WE HAVE WITH US TODAY AND AND THE DEPARTMENT DOES SECRETARY A SECRETARY KERN IN THIS YEAR HE'S GOING TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF MEANWHILE HAVE THE POPULATION OVERVIEW AFTERWARDS. SO WILL INVITE UP TO THE A. DESTINED TO SPEAK WITH US ON A SECRETARY KERN. WHO'S WITH THE DICK. CDC ARE SO. WELCOME. LET'S THERE WERE A WILL CALL THE LAUGHTER. WITH WITH WITH THE RIVER. YOU CAN ACTUALLY EXPAND CHAIR MEMBERS NOW I. FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT CORRECTION. FRANTICALLY SHE CALVET. VERY BRIEFLY I'M OVERVIEW ABOUT PROGRESS. WE MET LAST YEAR. CDC OUR HAS CONTINUE MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THAT PROGRESS IN ALL ASPECTS OF HOW WE INCARCERATE IN THE STATE. FROM WE HAVE PROGRAMS TO GANG MANAGEMENT SIGNING THEM EXCEPT FOR MEDI CAL TO EMIT EMPLOYMENT. RE ENTRY TO IMPLEMENTING STAFF TRAINING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN HEALTH CARE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE. INCREMENTAL PROGRESS IN IMPERFECT SYSTEM. I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT PROP FIFTY SEVEN WAS IMPLEMENTED JUST SEVEN MONTHS AGO HISTORICAL REFORM THAT REALLY CHANGED HOW WE INCARCERATE IN THE STATE. INCENTIVIZE INMATES TO PARTICIPATE IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND EARN THEIR WAY TOO EARLY RELEASE IT PROVIDES HOPE TO THE SYSTEM. THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD NO HOPE. IN NINETEEN SIXTIES THE AVERAGE SENTENCE WAS AROUND. TWENTY FIVE MONTHS TODAY IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS JUST UNDER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SO THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG ON OUR. POPULATION SIGNIFICANTLY PROP FIFTY SEVEN GIVES US A WAY TO GET OUT OF THAT PROBLEM I'LL TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT. A IN THE SECOND THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PROJECT A POP IS ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED. AND THAT'S TWENTY NINE HUNDRED BELOW CURRENT YEAR IN THE FOR ALL POPULATION IS GOING TO GROW TO FORTY NINE EIGHT HUNDRED ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED MORE. THOSE THOSE EFFORTS THAT REDUCTION IN PRISON POPULATION CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROP FIFTY SEVEN. OF THE DEPARTMENT MADE HER HERCULEAN EFFORT TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT SO FAST THESE OF THIS CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEM YOU CAN GOING TO ANY OF OUR PRISONS TODAY AND SEE INMATES. I'M PARTICIPATING IN PROGRAM ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS COMING AND. HOME A REAL CHANGE IN HOW WE INCARCERATE IN THIS STATE. HOME I I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE POPULAR DE BUDGET ITEMS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO. HERE TODAY A ONE OF THEM. IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME AND THAT'S THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION TO CLOSE CRC. AND TO KEEP WHEN OUT A STATE PROGRAM. IN ARIZONA WHO WHAT IT HAD THE EFFECT OF DOING IS INFLAMING MICE MY STAFF AT CRC. IT ALSO HAD OF THE. UNKNOWN IMPACT OF IN GREEN CCPOA WITHOUT NOTICE AND JUST SIMPLY A BAD RECOMMENDATION BY THE BUT BY THE LA NO. THE THREE JUDGE PANEL WAS VERY CLEAR AND AS YOU ALL KNOW WE ARE IN GREAT POPULATION CAP OF A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE. THAT THE COURTS MADE IT VERY CLEAR ABOUT HOW THE STATE PROGRAMS IT SAID THAT IT'S NOT IS. A DURABLE OR DESIRABLE SOLUTION IT WAS SENT THOUSANDS OF INMATES. WAY THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY FROM FAMILY SUPPORT IT WILL SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT COULD BE SPENT ON LANGUAGE LONG LASTING REFORM. THE COURT ORDERED US TO THAT WE COULD NOT INCREASE THE OUT OF STATE POPULATION BY MORE THAN EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED. AND IT SAID TO EXPLORE WAYS TO GET OUT OF COSTA THE SAME THING THAT THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THIS BODY. I'M ASKED US TO DO LAST YEAR SO IN THIS BUDGET WE PROPOSE TAKING DOWN ARE AT THE STATE PROGRAMS. AND SPELL FORTY FOUR HUNDRED INMATES TODAY. WILL BRING DOWN THIRTEEN HUNDRED IN MISSISSIPPI BY JUNE OF EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY ONE HUNDRED IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN. BUT TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR POPULATION CONTINUE. WITH THE LEGAL CHALLENGES PROP FIFTY SEVEN IS GOING TO THE REGULATIONS WILL BE FILED ON MARCH TWENTIETH IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD TO GET THOSE REGULATIONS FORTY ONE THOUSAND PUBLIC COMMENTS. WHICH WOULD WITH WHICH WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO AND WE WILL RESPOND IN TIME ON MARCH TWENTIETH OF THOSE REGULATIONS WILL BE FATHER WE WILL HAVE THE OPERATION OF LAW ON PROP FIFTY SEVEN. BUT THERE IS A NUMBER OF OTHER CHALLENGES THAT DEPARTMENTS FACING IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE UP TO OUR PROPOSITION. THOSE LEGAL CHALLENGES INCLUDED SUCH THINGS AS A SECULAR SUPERIOR COURT ON SEX OFFENDERS WHEN CLEARLY THE BALLOT MEASURE IN THE GOVERNOR INTENDED TO EXCLUDE SEX OFFENDERS. SO THAT LOWER COURT DECISION WILL BE APPEALED. TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THAT PROP FIFTY SEVEN WAS SOLD TO THE VOTERS THAT SEX OFFENDERS WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S. FILINGS IN THE SUPREME COURT A RELATED ALLOWING THIRD STRIKERS IN TO OUR. A NONVIOLENT FOR ALL PROCESS THIRD STRIKERS ALL INDETERMINATE SENTENCE INMATES WERE NEVER INTENDED TO BE INCLUDED IN OUR NONVIOLENT PAROLE PROCESS WE WILL APPEAL THAT TO THE HIGHEST COURT. DIDN'T SO THAT THE OTHER CHALLENGE I THINK THAT'S. BEFORE SYSTEM REDUCING CRIME KEEPING CALIFORNIA SAFE ACT IT'S GETTING SIGNATURES BUT IT ON YOU KNOW I THINK THE POORLY WRITTEN INITIATIVE DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS. THAT CREATES AB. INSTABILITY IN OUR POPULATION INVECTIVE THAT MEASURE IF THAT PROPOSITION IS ULTIMATELY PASSED IT WILL WIPE OUT ALL OF THE SAVINGS FOR PROP FIFTY SEVEN THAT. ALMOST ALL OF THE SAVINGS THAT WE PROJECT FOR. PROP FIFTY SEVEN. JUNE SO THE. LA JOH IN G. O. F. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THAT INITIATIVE SAID IT WOULD IMPACT ABOUT A THOUSAND INMATES AND COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO GET DEEPER ANALYSIS A REAL LEGAL THEORY IS THAT IT WILL IMPACT NINE UP TO NINE THOUSAND INMATES AND COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE TOWARDS THE HUNDRED OF. MILLION DOLLARS ACTUALLY NAY AND IT WILL AGAIN REDUCE ALL OF THE SAVINGS THAT WE WORK SO HARD TO. OBTAIN SO FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS TO THINK THAT WE COULD CLOSE CRC. IT'S JUST. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT CRC. IS. SYSTEM THE STAFF AT THAT SYSTEM AT AT THAT PRISON AND WORK VERY HARD TO KEEP THAT I'M VERY OLD PRISON TOGETHER. BUT OUR POPULATION JUST DOES NOT ALLOW US TO CLOSE ICRC AT THIS POINT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO TURN TO. THE INFRASTRUCTURE MOST OF OUR BUDGET REQUESTS ARE A LOT OF OUR BUDGET REQUESTS IS RELATED TO JUST BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RANGE THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR WE HAVE. HAD TERRIBLE. FLOODING AND. ROOF DAMAGE ACROSS OUR SYSTEM AND SO THE BUDGET REQUEST THAT YOU THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT. TODAY IN AND IN FUTURE SESSIONS IS RELATED TO US TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF THEM FIXING THE ROADS AND PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT. TO THAT I HAVE ATTACHMENTS FOR YOU ATTACHED A LETTER FROM THE. PRISON LAW OFFICE THAT TOOK ON SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE PICTURES WHICH YOU WILL SEE IS A MADE SLEEPING WITH PLASTIC BAGS OVER THE. LIGHTING FIXTURES KEEP THE WATER OFF THEIR BED THAT'S IN IN TALL A TOLERABLE SITUATION IN MY MIND AND IT'S JUST. NOT PROVIDING A BASIC HUMAN REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE A LIVABLE ENVIRONMENT SO THOSE UNADDRESSED INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES ARMS WILL KICK NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. ARM IN WALL THIS BUDGET REQUEST DOESN'T SOLVE ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS THE INVESTMENT IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE REQUIRED IN FUTURE BUDGETS. THE ONE TIME COSTS THAT YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT IS RELATED TO FIRST RESPONDER. FIRST RESPONDER KIND OF SERVICES SO TO BE ROPES AND RADIO SYSTEM IN HEALTH CARE VEHICLE SO THAT WE COULD TAKE OUR. OUR INMATES. TO THEIR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND SUCH. ANOTHER BIG PART OF OUR REFORM IS IN MADE EMPLOYMENT. I THINK A VERY COMMON SENSE. POINTS AND I'VE HEARD IT FROM AND OUR OUR PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS IS THAT A LIVABLE WAGE IS KEY TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. UMP SO WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ANY TO GET JUSTICE INVOLVED. FOLKS AS INTO THE STATEWIDE EMPLOYMENT PLAN INCREASED COORDINATION WITH THE TRAITS IMPACT THE PRISON INDUSTRY AUTHORITY. AYE IS PROVIDING TOOLS AND UNION DUES FOR MEMBERS ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAM SO THAT WHEN AN OFFENDER GETS OUT THAT CAN GO TO THE UNION ALL HAVE A. A LIFETIME. EMPLOYMENT. COULDN'T SEWING INCREASED TRADE APPRENTICESHIPS DIRECT KIND OF INMATES INTO THE STATE'S SOBEL SERVICE JOBS WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING INMATES APPLYING WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON TO GO WORK FOR CALTRANS WOULD UGS. ALL. ALT KEY TO. CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT THAT I THINK PROP FIFTY SEVEN HAS HAS GIVEN US TO CHANGE HOW WE INCARCERATE IN THE STATE ONE OF OUR BUDGET PROPOSALS. INVOLVES. TAKING A PAROLE PAROLE  <u><c.green>CAMP IS YOU KNOW WE</c></u> HAVE A ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED INMATES HAVE FIGHT FIRES ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW WHO WROTE CONVECTIVE LOST A COUPLE OF THOSE FIREFIGHTERS. AS THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING THE DANGEROUS WORK THAT THEY DO. VALLEY ALWAYS RECOMMENDED. AGAINST THAT PROPOSAL AND THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO CREATE IN THIS IS SIMPLY THAT. OFFENDERS THAT SPEND THEIR LIFE IN OUR HOME AS SPEND THEIR CAR SERRATION ARE WORKING IN OUR FIRE CAMPS IN GETTING THAT SKILLS. ON YOU WANT TO GOING TO THE FIRE TRADE WHEN THEY'RE DONE. AND IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO TRY TO PROVIDE A VEHICLE IN WHILE THAT THE ALLEY ALWAYS SUGGESTED THAT IT'S BECAUSE IT WON'T REDUCE RECIDIVISM I THINK THAT UNDERMINES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN OUR SYSTEM. OF TRYING TO PROVIDE AVENUES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE MEANINGFUL WORK. SO I I I JUST SAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT THE REJECTION OF THE FIRE CAMPUS AND OTHER BAD RECOMMENDATION BY THE LA NO. IN OTHER PROPOSALS TO TAKE SEVENTY SIX YOU. IN HOUSE IN OUR G. DJJ FACILITY THAT WERE CONVICTED IN ADULT COURT COMMITTED CRIMES BEFORE THEY'RE EIGHTEEN BERNIE BIRTHDAY WHERE ADJUDICATED BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE. INCOMPLETE THEIR SENTENCE BEFORE THEIR TWENTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY. ADULT PRISONS EAT UP YOUNGER OFFENDERS IN SO KEEPING OFFENDERS IN DJJ I. OF FOR A GREATER PEER TIME BETTER PROGRAMMING WITHIN THE IT WITHIN THAT. YOU REALLY REFORM SYSTEM IS JUST COMMON SENSE AND BUTTON IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT IS. IN ESSENCE OF AGAIN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO DO WITH PROP FIFTY SEVEN. SO IN CONCLUSION WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE ARE SYSTEM ON THE MOVE WE'RE CHANGING THEM. WE'RE CHANGING THE SYSTEM FOR STAFF AND INMATES WERE TRYING TO DO SMARTCARD SERRATION WHERE NATIONWIDE LEADER IN CORRECTIONS THAT I THINK YOU CAN BE PROUD OF. IN I DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST BELIEVE ME I HOPED SHE WOULD TALK TO OUR MARK CRITICS TO. INMATES THERE ADVOCATES I'M AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN IN OUR STATE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. ON TO SUSTAIN THIS PROGRESS GOING FORWARD AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO TRY TO INCIDENT AS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WINNER CALDERON ON THAT DAY I THINK EVERYONE IS HERE ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WEBER HERE. JONES SAWYER HERE. LACKEY HERE MULLIN DANCE. STONE. TING. THANK YOU. OF WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE WITH US OUR BUDGET YEAR WITH SITTING AND. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ATTAIN WHO'S HERE WITH US ALSO TODAY. ANY QUESTIONS YES. STONE. THANK YOU IT. UNDERSTAND YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND AND YOUR REACTION TO THE RECOMMENDATION TO CLOSE THE FACILITY. IT IN THIS WAY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WAS WHAT WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR CLOSING FACILITIES. WE'RE SEEING REDUCTION IN INMATES WERE SINGLE REDUCTION IN CRIME ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE'RE COMING OUT OF AN AREA WHERE WE HAD STARTED SENDING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE INTO PRISONS AND. REALIZING WHAT. AND IMPACT THAT HAS ON CALIFORNIA WOULD A MISTAKE THAT THAT ULTIMATELY WAS SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE BENEFIT OF THE REFORMER KNOCK AND SEE THE BENEFIT. OF THE COST SAVINGS ACROSS THE BOARD. UNTIL WE REALLY START TO CLOSE SOME OF THE FACILITIES THAT WERE BUILT. IN THAT FRENZY TO TO BUILD PRISONS AND MAYBE SOME OLDER ONES I COMPLETELY AGREE WE CAN'T BE SENDING PRISONERS OUT OF STATE. WE NEED TO KEEP THEM HERE AND IF WE'RE GOING TO START DOING THAT WE NEED TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS YOUR STAFF THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING THERE AND. DIED. NOT DO IT WITHOUT A SENSITIVITY TO WHAT THAT WORKFORCE IS IT AND WHO THEY'RE BRINGING. WHICH MEANS THERE NEEDS TO BE A PLAYER THERE NEEDS TO BE A THOUGHT OF WHERE WE WANT TO GO OVER TIME. AND HOW WE GET THERE AND SO IF WE CAN. HAVE IF WE WILL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT AND I KNOW YOU COME IN WITH REQUESTS FOR FACILITIES AND. MAKING SURE THAT THEIR NOT HAVING TO PUT THE PLASTIC OVER THE LAMP SHADES TO TO PROTECT THEIR BEDS FROM THE WATER THERE A LOT OF CRUMBLING FACILITIES BUT WE GET CAUGHT UP IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WHEN. THERE IS THIS NOTION OF WE WE HAVE TO FIX OUR FACILITIES THE FEAR IS THAT WE'RE JUST CREATING MORE BATS WERE S. BUILDING LARGER FACILITIES. AND NOT BUILDING THEM IN WAYS THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE REHABILITATION MODEL THAT. I NO WORK WE'RE HEADING INTO SO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT HOW DO WE REALLY LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM WHAT THE CAPACITY IS WHERE WE WANT TO GO. AND START LOOKING AT WHAT FACILITIES WE WE CAN START TO MOVE AWAY FROM. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY FAIR QUESTION AND PLEASE DON'T TAKE FROM MY COMMENTS THAT I DON'T THINK AT SOME POINT. THAT WE DO NEED TO CLOSE. PRISONS. PROP FIFTY SEVEN WILL DO THAT LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU THAT IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHO'S SEVEN MONTHS AGO OR SO. ARE WE WERE THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE INMATES UNDER THE FEDERAL CAP THAT THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE INMATES IS IS TRULY A BAD WEEKEND IN OUR WORLD. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OF HOW THE COUNTY SAN INMATES TO US THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE. IT WAS A LOT OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS TO THAT PERIOD WHEN WE GO OVER THAT CAP WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT FEDERAL COURT. OF TO A COMPLIANCE OFFICER RELEASES OFFENDERS THAT IS ONE OF THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO STOP THAT'S WHAT. PROP FIFTY SEVEN DID. IF IF IT WEREN'T FOR PROP FIFTY SEVEN WE WOULD BE OVER THE CAP FACING COURT. BATTLE RELEASES TODAY. THAT THAT IS THE FACT OF THE MATTER WE. NEEDED PROP FIFTY SEVEN TO WORK. I THINK THAT THE INSTABILITY OF THE POPULATION IN INITIATIVE THAT IS YOU KNOW IS GETTING SIGNATURES TODAY THAT'S GONNA WIPE OUT OUR. SAVINGS PUTS US IN THIS TERRIBLE SITUATION AND AS A SECRETARY WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU. AND YOU KNOW AND TALKING TO THE GOVERNOR DIRECTLY WE DO NOT WANT ITS NOT GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY TO RELEASE VENDORS BY THE COURTS. WHAT FIFTY SEVEN DID IS IT CHANGED THAT INSTEAD OF THE COURTS JUST RELEASING INDISCRIMINATELY OFFENDERS OFFENDERS THAT ARE GOING TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE GOING INTO A REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THEY CAN EARN THEIR WAY OUT THAT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO DO IT? AND I ALSO SAY TO YOU FOR. THIRTY FIVE YEARS I WORKED IN THE APARTMENT WAS A TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OVERCROWDING EVERY SPACE IN THE PRISON WAS. HUMAN DENSITY JAMS AND DAY ROOMS AND WE GOT WHAT WE SET OUT WE GOT A VIOLENCE WE GOT WORSE CRIMINAL WHEN WE GOT OUT. I TO YOUR POINT ABOUT HAVING A PLAN I THINK THAT THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THIS POPULATION. POSSIBILITIES LOOKING IN THE FUTURE I THINK THE LA DOES RECOMMENDATION IS JUST WAY PRO PREMATURE NOTWITHSTANDING THE INSENSITIVITY TO MY STAFF IT AT. TO PRISON OR THE UNION. BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE A PLAN WE DO NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. HOME AS THE POPULATION IS. REDUCED. HOW HOW DO WE GO ABOUT CLOSING THE PRISON I THINK IT'S OF ABSOLUTE FAIR CONVERSATION I JUST THINK? I'M IN THIS BUDGET AT THIS TIME IT'S. JUST NOT DO MY UNDERSTANDING SENSITIVITY TO THIS AND AND. MAYOR MADE OUT BE PREMATURE BUT. GETTING OUT AHEAD OF THIS CONVERSATION IN PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAN PUTTING THE OTHER SORT OF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE HOW WE ULTIMATELY GET THERE SINCE WE SEEM TO AGREE THAT WE NEED TO BE REALLY FOCUSING ON FACILITIES. BOTH ENSURING THAT THE FACILITIES ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE CATS REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS THAT THAT WE KNOW WORK IN THAT THAT ARE APPROPRIATE. BUT ADDRESSING SOME OF THE OLDER ONES IN AND AND THEN I ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT DJJ P. SINCE YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. THAT IS VERY INTERESTING TO AND THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED A BE THIRTEEN KNOW IT LAST YEAR RECOGNIZING THE. THE AGE AND ALL THE SCIENCE REALLY POINTS THAT AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AND I THINK THIS IS IN LINE WITH IT. BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERN ABOUT. HOLDING JUVENILE OFFENDERS LONGER ABOUT NOT. GETTING THEM BACK TO THEIR. LOCAL. FACILITIES BECAUSE KIDS DO BETTER WHEN THEY'RE CLOSER TO HOME WHEN THEY'RE CLOSER TO FAMILY. IN SO IF WE THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS AND IT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THIS PROMISE OF KEEPING. YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS AWAY FROM THE ADULT PRISONS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. LENGTHENING THE TIME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE INDEED JJ WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE STILL. ENSURING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING BACK TO THE JUVENILE. FACILITIES IN THEIR COUNTIES AND WE NEED TO BOLSTER THOSE PROGRAM SO THAT THEY ARE STRONGER. THERE SO WE WERE NOT PULLING KIDS UP TO STOCK TO LEAVE THEM CLOSER THEIR COMMUNITIES CLOSER THEIR FAMILIES THEY TEND TO DO BETTER. AND SO I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH WITH THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. THAT. THAT WHOLE PROCESS. SO HOLISTICALLY AND WHERE KIDS NEED TO BE PLACED AS WE TRY TO PROTECT THEM FROM GOING. INTO ADULT POPULATIONS UNNECESSARILY YOU IF YOU HAVE FAIR ENOUGH I THINK THAT THE UNITED TYPE WE HAD TEN THOUSAND YOU. FULL OFFENDERS HAVE WITHIN DJJ TODAY WE HAVE AROUND SIX HUNDRED LITTLE OVER SIX HUNDRED. WE ARE GETTING AND ONLY THE MOST CHALLENGING CASES THE COUNTIES ARE KEEPING MORE THE JUVENILES. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH WITH THIS OF PROPOSAL WOULD DO IS IF AN OFFENDER. THAT'S UNDER UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. IS DOING WELL IN BJJ. IT'S REALLY JUST KEEPING THEM IN THAT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUE WITH THAT'S THAT WHEN HE COMPLETES HIS SENTENCE HE CAN GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY BUT I AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. I I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THIS IS TAKING OFFENDERS THAT ARE AN ADULT PRISON. POPPING THEM AND DJJ THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT IT NO NO I UNDERSTAND YOUR TEN AND. THEN I AGREE WITH THAT INTENT OF OF ENSURING THAT THEY'RE SERVING THEIR TIME. WHERE THEY'RE BEING SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE AS SOON AS THEY GO TO THE DOUGH? PRISON. WHEN IT'S NOT REALLY WARRANTED THAT HAS THAT CAN REALLY HURT THEIR REHABILITATION AND HURT WHO THEY ARE. ON THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS IN ASSURING THAT. THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING ENVIRONMENT WHERE KIDS MIGHT BE INDEED JJ LONGER THAT WAR THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA BE BEING HELD THE DJJ WHEN THEY REALLY SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE FINDING WAYS TO GET THEM BACK TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE SENSITIVITY IS NOT TO THE AGE WHERE. SPECIFICALLY THAT THEN THAT'S I AGREE WITH YOU ON A PERSON THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. I ACTUALLY HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS INTO IT AND MAYBE WE CAN COOK BUT NO ONE IS HERE ALL. ALL MORNING ON A SUB YOU CAN YOU CAN WORK ON AND GET BACK. BUT THEN I I'M ACTION REAL SENSITIVE TO TO POSITION YOUR URANUS AS A. VOICE IS A FORMER BUREAUCRAT WHEN. YOU'RE AT THE MERCY OF AYE NOW TALK ABOUT ELECTED OFFICIALS ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO COME UP WITH THESE IDEAS. LIKE PROP 47-57. ONE AMOUNT AB ONE ON I. WITHOUT REALLY CONSULTING WITH THE PEOPLE LEFT IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE CAUGHT. WHICH YEAR WOULD NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES NOW ENOUGH MONEY. AND QUITE FRANKLY SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A STUPID IDEA BUT WE YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT. AND SO I I. I FEEL WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THAT SAME SITUATION ON. I WORK FOR THE CITY OF LA. AND SO UP I I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE STATE'S CONCERNS AND IF YOU CAN SEE. POPULATION IS IS NUMBER ONE ON EVERYONE'S. LIST RIGHT NOW. AND I IMAGINE DJJ SALT BUT TO START WITH THAT. AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE DO NEED. TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT TOTALLY BE UNDER YOUR PURVIEW. WHAT WE ARE I MEAN I AM CONCERNED THAT I'VE BEEN TOLD IT COSTS A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR HALF A KID? THAT'S A GOOD YET J.. SO FOR A WHOLE KID IS LIKE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH IS LIKE YOU KNOW I CAN GET THEM AT THE S. C.. ON FOUR YEARS FELLOWSHIP AND. ON ONE YEAR'S WORTH THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND ON THEM. AND SO WE WE NEED TO TALK THROUGH WHAT ARE THEY WHAT SERVICES ARE REALLY GETTING SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO COME TO YOU. I MEAN LOOK AT THAT AMOUNT. ON. SHIP CONDO AND. PRIVATE TUTOR AND A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER THINGS BUT. I. I AM SENSITIVE TO. AS THE AGE OUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH YOU SO I GO ON A MISSION I JUST RESPOND TO IT. REALLY QUICK COMMUNITY GETS ECONOMY OF SCALE WE HAVE SOME SIX HUNDRED WELL ARMED YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS IN THREE FACILITIES. I'M WOULD PROVIDE THE MOST INTENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH. AND PROGRAMMING FOR THAT POPULATION THAT YOU CAN. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY A NATIONAL. MODEL IT IS IN CREDIBLY EXPENSIVE THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AND I CERTAINLY SEE WHY SOMEONE WOULD QUESTION AND I'VE HEARD HEARD THE COMMENT YOU GET SENDS STANFORD MAMA CONDOS ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTANDABLE. PERCENT LIZZIE V. ALCAZAR. THE MOST CHALLENGING MENTAL HEALTH VIOLENT SEX OFFENDERS THERE REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EFFORT I BELIEVE TO TRY TO GET THEM. INTO A. PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE IN SOCIETY AND IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO DO SO. AND SO I I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION AND AT IN HOW WE ADDRESS IT BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN WALK INTO OUR DJJ FACILITIES TODAY. AND YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE A STARK STARK DIFFERENCE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE SAW. TEN YEARS AGO IN WHICH YOU SEEN AS THE MOST TROUBLED YOUTH IN OUR STATE. GETTING SERVICES AND TRYING TO GET THEM TO A POINT WHERE THEY CAN GO BACK OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND BE SUCCESSFUL. AND SO WE. DEATHLY ONE HAVE THAT BECAUSE I I WILL TELL YOU. BUT PEOPLE LIKE US DEVON WALKER FROM. CCPOA HAVE DONE A MASTERFUL JOB AT TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO ME TO POPULATION THAT EVEN THOUGH WE MAY ABSENT. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO LOCAL LEVEL ONE NINE YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY AND MORE POSITIONS AND AND AND SO HE'S HE'S HE'S BEEN GOOD AT. EXPLAINING THINGS TO ME PROBABLY HAD TO DOUBLE DOWN FOR ME BUT I I GET SOME OF THAT. BUT. I STILL NEEDS MORE EXPLANATION TO GET ME COMFORTABLE AT AT ANY LEVEL. BOTH GIVING INCREASE IN IN POSITIONS OR OR OR. BURKE THE BUDGET. IN FACT I I WOULD RECOMMEND TO DISHES I HAVE BOTH CHAIRS A BUDGET OF FIVE AND IN A CHAIR OF. OUR BUDGET THT AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU HEAR FROM ME THAT WEEK WE DON'T APPROVE ANY POSITIONS AND WE DON'T APPROVE ANY INCREASES IN BUDGET UNTIL WE. HAVE THAT QUESTION ANSWER TO THE SATISFACTION OF NOT ONLY JUST COMMITTEE PITIFUL BUDGET COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT THE MONIES THAT WE GIVE YOU. ARE I SPENT TWO TWO IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY AND UP THAT NIGHT. FLAP THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ASKING THIS QUESTION FOUR SOMETIMES AFFECTED WE KEEP COMING BACK AND ASKING OVER AND OVER. I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED SOME KIND OF BICAMERAL AUDIT WITH ALL LOOKED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN EXPLAINED IT TO US. BUT AT SOME POINT AND WE PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE IT DONE NOW OF WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE BY NOW TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THROUGH TO. TAXPAYERS. Y. THIS SYSTEMS CONTINUALLY IS IS EXPENDING TOO MUCH BUT A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW. ARGOSY TOO MUCH BECAUSE AGAIN I'M GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. THAT YOU MAY ACTUALLY NEED THIS. GREATLY INCREASES SINCE I'M NOT GONNA MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT MAKING ANY SENSE TO US AND IN THE SAME WITH. PEOPLE COMING IN. BRING ELEMENT FROM OUT OF STATE I THINK YOU'LL GET. FULL AGREEMENT FROM DISK COMMITTEE IN MOTION PEOPLE AND ON BUDGET THAT WE WE NEED TO PULL PEOPLE OUT OF LOS OUT OF STATE PRISONS AND BRING IT BACK HOME CLOSER TO TO FAMILIES. OF. AS A FORMER DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE ABSOLUTELY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BECAUSE THE MORE MONEY FOR HIM DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LESS MONEY AFTER SPIN ON THE BACK AND. ON TO BUILD NEW FACILITIES AND SO MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE TO DISCUSSION ALLEY ABOUT. I'LL I DON'T KNOW SHE SAY CLOSE PRISONS. BUT I TALK ABOUT. RECONFIGURING THEM. DEBT DAY AIR BECOME REHABILITATION CENTER. PLACES WHERE WE SEND PEOPLE THAT CAN IMPROVE THEIR LIVES BETTER AND THAT. FACILITY LIKE ELLIPTICAL HAPPY PLACE BECOMES A PLACE WHERE. WE'RE SENDING OUR FIGHT I WILL SAY THAT OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST WHO ARE INCARCERATED THAT WANT TO TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND. AND WE PUT PROVIDE A SPACE WHERE THEY CAN'T. SO. S. DAEDALUS WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE A PRISON. WILL DEFINITELY DO THAT. BUT WHEN I OPEN UP THE LIGHT AT THE OTHER END WHERE I WOULD PUT A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS. SOCIAL WORKERS SO. A PSYCHIATRIST TO GET PEOPLE WHILE IT CRIMINALITY AND ON BACK INTO THE STE BACK IN SOCIETY A LOT QUICKER WITH A SKILL SET. THAT ISLAM DOUBLE KEEPING GOING AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. BUT IT FORTUNATE FOR YOU OF I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT. BIG PLAN WHICH WE JUST KIND OF FORCED ON YOU RIGHT NOW AND UP I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT FUTURE. BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS WERE IT NOT ONLY WHERE YOU CAN DO. I KNOW YOU GET MIRED INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. BUT WE NEED I KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO FIVE TO TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHAT YEAR YOU YOU'RE AT THE. BEGINNING OF SAID IN A WHOLE NEW WAY THAT WE DO CORRECTIONS AND WHAT YOU DO NOW CASSETTE PRECEDENTS FOR THE NEXT FIVE OR TEN YEARS AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE FRUSTRATION WERE GETTING HERE. I KNOW IT'S IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING BATTLES EVERYDAY. BUT WE NEED SOME VISIONARY STUFF GOING ON RIGHT NOW. ABOUT WHERE YOU SEE US IN THE NEXT FIVE OR TEN YEARS. I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION AND YOU KNOW WHILE. WE TRY TO MAKE THIS HISTORIC CHANGES THAT ARE IS PROP FIFTY SEVEN I DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF IT IS A HISTORIC CHANGE I MEAN EVERYBODY IN THE SYSTEM. BOAT FLOATED IF I CAN SAY IT LIKE THAT. OTHER THAN CONDEMNED IN AL AQSA A VAST VAST MAJORITY OF INMATES NOW HAVE INCENTIVE TO GO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS AND EARN THEIR WAY OUT IT IS REALLY HISTORIC CHANGE IT'S BEING DONE NOWHERE ELSE IN THE NATION. AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE'VE BEEN UNDER FIRE COMPLETELY FREELY FROM BOTH SIDES BE A COURT ACTIONS ON ONE SIDE OR. YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE OTHERS AND I THINK IT'S FAIR FOR YOU TO SAY WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE VISION INTO THE FUTURE. THAT'S WHY SOME OF OUR REQUESTING MAY IMPLEMENT RIFTS IN IN THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT. FOR THAT PART OF IT I LOOK FORWARD TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND TALKING TO YOU ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD BUT IS THIS AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE TRY TO LOOK AT THAT VISION AND MAYBE THIS IS. YET MAYBE MY OWN FAILURES. EVERY DAY IN OUR SYSTEM AS POSITIVE AS I'M TELLING YOU. MURDERS. RIOTS SUICIDES O. DIS GANG VIOLENCE. THERE'S NO SET OF INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS THAT WE COULD PUT COUNTLESS DOLLARS WORDS I TRY TO MAKE IT A BETTER SYSTEM AYE AYE HAPPIER SYSTEM. WE HAVE SPACE ISSUES WE'RE LOOKING FOR TECHNOLOGY TO HELP US DO THAT THERE'S ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS THAT. THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN OUR BUDGET REQUESTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THAT BUT. I JUST WANT YOU KNOW AND YOU BEEN. VERY ENGAGED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN CORRECTIONAL ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO DO IT SO DON'T THINK YOU'RE HEAPING. ANYMORE ON ME. OF THIS DEPARTMENT IN THIS PRISON SYSTEM NEEDS IT TODAY. TRAIN UP A LEAVE YOU WITH. WHAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO EMBRACE OTHER CITY? ALL I WANT YOU TO BE TOUGH ON CRIME. BUT ALSO WHAT YOU BE STRONG A REHABILITATION. SO HOPEFULLY THAT MODEL. IT'S WHAT YOU TAKE COME FROM TODAY. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK YOU PROBABLY GLEAN FROM THE COMMENTS OF OF LOUNGE. I'M SORRY IT'S KNOW SLIPKNOT I'M. I I DIDN'T SEE HIM SO GOOD WAS SITTING. MR SECRETARY THANK YOU SO JUST GOING BACK TO ON. MY COLLEAGUE FROM. SANTA CRUZ'S POINT ON YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF. PERMANENT ONGOING BUDGET REQUESTS ARE CORRECTING HERE IS A PERMANENT ONGOING POSITIONS THESE ARE NOT NONE OF THEM ARE TEMPORARY GO FOR THE DJJ YES BUT I DON'T KNOW BUT JUST BUT JUST FOR YOUR BUT YOUR THROUGH. CCR BUDGETS. UNLIKE VARIOUS ITEMS THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF STAFFING THINGS LIKE AND THESE ARE PERMANENT ONGOING BETTER IF THEY INVOLVED A. YOU KNOW POSITION JUST SO THEY WOULD BE ONGOING THANK YOU. IN AND IS A POPULATION THAT YOU'RE SERVING DECLINE CAN YOU PREDICT THE DECLINE. IT'S STARTING DECLINE AND DO YOU FORESEE IT TO CONTINUE TO KREIDER DO YOU FORESEE. AND IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO PROVE DO YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT THE CLIENT. AT THIS POINT IN YOUR THE IT FOR WHAT I THINK YOU'RE PROP FIFTY SEVEN IS ALLOWED TO WORK I THINK IF THERE'S NO INITIATIVES THAT AND DO. THOSE POPULATION. CHANGES THAT YES I THINK THAT THE POPULATION WILL DECLINE. PROP FIFTY SEVEN I THINK PROJECTED ABOUT. ELEVEN THOUSAND OR SO. IN THAT THREE YEARS OUT TOLD OVER THAT SAME TIME FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS DO YOU FORESEE YOUR BUDGET GOING UP OR DOWN. SEE GOING UP. AND WHY IS THAT I THINK THAT THAT WE HAVE A BILLION OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND WE HAVE NOT INVESTED FOR YEARS AND YEARS. TO ADDRESS ROUGH SAN AIR HANDLING UNITS HAVE PRISONS IN THE DESERT THAT GET A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES AND. I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE IS IS STRONG. AS A SAID IN OUR BUDGET REQUESTS AND THIS IS JUST. TO ADDRESS SOME A MEDIA ISSUES. THAT THAT I THINK THAT. BROUGH THAT A STATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO INVEST IN THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION ASSETS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME IT WOULD BE OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT. I WITH THE SPIKE APPEARED. WE'RE YOU. KNOW WHAT WAS YOUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT YOU'RE ASKING PUBLIC SAFETY LAWSUITS I. SENT IN THE ATTACHMENTS THAT I I SENT THEM YOU CAN JUST READ THE PRISON LAW OFFICES LETTER IT IS CLEAR WHILE THEY'VE SUIT IS SO. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN OVER. WE. THE MENTAL HEALTH IS BEEN UNDER OVERSIGHT OF THE FEDERAL COURT FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS. ON THIS IS THE NEXT STRATEGY THIS IS THE NEXT LAWSUIT. THAT WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS THE INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS I JUST AFFECT THE FINANCIAL ESTIMATE AS TO WHAT THE RETURN INVESTMENTS COULD BE FROZE. HOME AT IT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY RETURN WELL YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY. AND WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL BENEFIT FOR THE STATE TO GIVE YOU THE ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS OVER THE. FROM. I'M CHARGED WITH HOUSING OFFENDERS THAT ARE COMMITTED BY THE COURTS AND SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT ALWAYS DISCUSSION ABOUT MASS INCARCERATION SPIRALING OUT A STATE I MEAN SPIRALING BUDGETS. THOUGH OVER INCARCERATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR YOU KNOW ALL OF THOSE THOSE ISSUES STEPS IT BEFORE SO I HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE ABOUT HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND INMATES TODAY. AND GROWS ABOUT A THOUSAND. YEAR. SO IN WHAT WE DO THESE POPULATION REDUCTION MEASURES TO REDUCE LIKE PROP FIFTY SEVEN. YOU HOPE THAT YOU WILL SEE A DECLINE IN THE POPULATION BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S. IN STONE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THEN I SO I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET YOUR QUESTION ABOUT RETURN ON INVESTMENT BUT I THINK THAT THE PRISON PRISON SYSTEMS INTERCALL TO KEEPING PUBLIC SAFETY. I THINK THE LEADING LEADING THE COURTS JUST LET OUT INMATES. IT'S TERRIBLE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE WILL RUE THE DAY THAT THAT HAPPENS AND SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO KEEP OUR PRISON SYSTEM UP INCARCERATED PEOPLE THAT COME TO US FROM THE COURTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY I DON'T THINK ANYBODY. DISAGREES WITH. YOUR STATEMENT BUT AGAIN THIS IS A. BUDGET COMMITTEE MY MY FABULOUS COLLEGE IN LOS ANGELES CHAIRS A POLICY COMMITTEE. WE DON'T DEAL WITH SUCH COMPLEX ISSUES HERE WHICH IS TO WHAT BUDGETARY ISSUES. SO HOME FINANCIALLY I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ARMY. YOU'RE ONE OF THE ONLY DEPARTMENTS WERE THE POPULATION THAT YOU'RE SERVING IS GOING DOWN AND YOU ARE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY. ENTERED FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE I I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER. AGENCIES ETCETERA SIMILAR POSITIONS I THINK FROM OUR. BUDGETARY STANDPOINT I THINK YOU NEED TO. SIT DOWN WITH MISTER JONES SAWYER TALKED WEBER A BETWEEN NOW AND MAY TO REALLY. PROVIDE SOME. LONGER TERM JUSTIFICATION YOU'RE ASKING FOR. PERMANENT LONGER TERM AUGMENTATION. WITHOUT A PLAN ARE YOUR POPULATIONS GOING DOWN. YOU HAVEN'T DEMONSTRATED FINANCIALLY WHAT THE BENEFIT IS AND SO IT'S VERY VERY. UNCHALLENGING. THE BUDGET'S GOING UP ABOUT. PLEASE HAVE JUST IN GENERAL NUMBERS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO ELEVEN FIVE LAST YEAR TWELVE PERCENT WITH A PERCENT OF YOUR BUDGET. TO. I THINK ABOUT TWO AND AND I'LL AND I'LL GIVE ME JUST IN THE POPULATIONS DOWN EX PERCENT WHERE WHERE'S MY POINT SIR. FOUR HUNDRED AND THAT IS AN EMPLOYEE CALL. FOUR HUNDRED IS RAISES FOR MY STAFF THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. LET THE BUDGET REQUEST THAT I HAVE BEFORE YOU ARE TO THE EDGE YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF MY POINT MAYBE IN OUR POLICE SAID TO TRY TO SUPPORT CHANGING THE SYSTEM. WHICH WHICH WE WANT TO DO BUT WE DID PAID IT DOWN AND AGAIN I HEAR YOU'RE VERY LUCKY OF THREE. FABULOUS MEMBERS WHO ARE. FAR IN FAR MORE INTELLIGENT THAN ME SO I NEED TO HAVE THINGS A LITTLE MORE SIMPLE. HOME. I DON'T SEE THE JUSTIFICATION AND I DON'T SEE HOME AGAIN THE. THIRD THINK SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE. CAN'T GET THAT THINKING BETWEEN NOW IN MAY WHEN WE SHUT DOWN THIS PROCESS. BUT THAT'S WHAT WERE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WE WE WANT TO BE. THOUGHT WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE VISION. BUT AGAIN I'M THAT THE WAY I LOOK AT THE. IT'S IT'S SORT OF LIKE GOT INCENTIVES WE GET A WE YOUR DOOR SORT OFASKING. FOR INCENTIVES TO. IMPROVE TO RE ENVISION THE SYSTEM I KNOW THESE ARE CHICKENS COMING TO ROOST OVER THIRTY FORTY YEARS OF POLICIES THAT. WERE WHERE HAPPENED A HINDSIGHT BEING TWENTY TWENTY BE LOOKING AT AND I THINK EVERYONE IS PATIENT AND OPEN TO VERY MUCH SUPPORTING THAT CHANGE IN DIRECTION. THAT SOME POINT. SHIPS TURNED AND YOU'RE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION YOU NEED TO GO. AND I THINK THE BUDGET EASTER REFLECT. SO WE JUST WANT TO KNOW WHEN THAT. DAY YES THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH FROM THE ONLY THING I WOULD. I'D LIKE TO SEE CHEN I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE DIALOGUE AND IN. DO A BETTER JOB OF TRYING TO IMPRESS ON YOU. ALONE KNOW SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT IMPACT OUR BUDGET AND IT IS EMPLOYEE COPIED IS. INCREASED HEALTH CARE COSTS INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH COSTS THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF INACTION I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE AGENCY I HAD JUST SEEN THE STATE HAS WILL FINISH. EVER SINCE I'VE BECOME ONE OF THE ONLY AGENCIES THAT'S. TAKING CARE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND GALLONS THAT YOU KNOW OUR DOT ORG SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO DO IT AND THEN IT'S. YOU KNOW IT IS HE'D SPEW SO SIMPLE ABOUT IT BUT IT. THAT THAT COSTS THAT WE THAT INCUR ARE THE PRICE PREEMIE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED DJJ WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THE MOST VIOLENT. NO MURDERS INDETERMINATE SENTENCE SEX OFFENDERS. MENTAL HEALTH FORTY THOUSAND OF MY POPULATION IS MENTALLY ILL THAT REQUIRES US COURT ORDERED STAFF BEING. ALL MY MEDICAL SO A HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS HAS BEEN UNDER RECEIVERSHIP FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS THEY ORDER MORE STAFF AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURES ON A ON. THE BUDGET BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION WELL AND THERE'S AND THERE'S PRESSURE ON US TO THIS PRESSURE US IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE CAL WORKS CAL FRESH HIGHER EDUCATION K. TWELVE. SO HOME I UNDERSTAND YOUR SITUATION IS SPECIAL THAT EVERY AGENCY IN THIS STATE IS SPECIAL ALSO GET AHOLD THAT. ALFA GHETTO THAT'S HERE THAT WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT. AND YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M NOT BUT I GET PAID TO. DEFEND MY DEPARTMENT IN THE PEOPLE THAT I'M IN CHARGE WITH INCARCERATING. AND SO THAT'S THE ONLY DISTINCTION LIKE NOTHING AGAINST ALL OF THOSE OTHER VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY ONE THIS COMMITTEE GETS GETS PAID TERM. MANAGE THE STATE'S RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT RETURN ON INVESTMENT SO WHEN YOU CAN PROPERLY IT'S THAT QUESTION THAT WE CAN PROPERLY MAKE THAT DECISION. SO ARM FOR FOR US. WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR MISSION. ABSOLUTELY AND WE WANT TO SUPPORT TO DIRECTOR GOMANTAK GOES BACK TO MISTER JONES SAWYER. WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A PLAN THAT YOU PUT TOGETHER YOUR TEAM PUT TOGETHER. THAT IS TAUGHT FULL BLACK HARM THAT PROVIDES US DIRECTION LONG TERM VISION BUT IN IN ABSENCE OF THE PLAN THEN IT'S. BECOMES AND WE HAVE TO DEVELOP. WHICH WE WOULD RATHER NOT DO YOUR. YOUR THEM SECRETARY YOUR THE DEPARTMENT HEAD YOU WE WHAT WE WANT YOUR PLAN WOULD WANT OUR PLAN. YOU AND YOUR DEATH WE DON'T ON OUR PLANET. SO. WELL WELL. WE WANT IS AGAIN YOUR GUIDANCE YOUR INTELLIGENCE YOUR DAY TO DAY ANALYSIS BUT. ARE YOU ASKING FOR PERMANENT. ONGOING FUNDS. AND AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO TELL US. WHEN THAT'S GONNA HEAD. OTHERWISE HE SHALL BE TEMPORARY POSITIONS. SO AGAIN ON. YOUR WE WE WE DEAL WITH PRETTY SIMPLE THINGS IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THERE THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH DOLLARS AND CENTS YOU. YOU GIVE ME A LOT OF GREAT RHETORIC A LOT OF THIS A LOT OF THAT. SHOW ME THE NUMBERS. AND THEN WE CAN TALK. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER. SECRETARY CURRENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AYE I DON'T IF I CAN ADD ANYTHING WHAT AT THAT AFTER THIS OF THE YOU KNOW BUDGET YEAR SPOKEN BUT. CLEARLY I THINK WHAT WHAT AT AND I THINK YOU GET THE MESSAGE THAT. EVEN IN THE RIP. IN THE THOUGHT THAT IF WE DO INCREASES WEATHERED AND STAFF OR FUNDING OR BUDGET. THE SUCTION IS THAT THERE IS A LARGER PLAN DOWN THE ROLE THAT IT COOPER THAT THESE IF WE MAKE THE. INCREASE IN SAY RESOURCES THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE POPULATION THAT MEASLES RESOURCES WILL DECLINE. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED BY IT AND WHAT'S THE STAFF OF THESE FACILITIES TO ACTUALLY COME UP. WITH A PLAN BECAUSE BUT NO ONE WRITES A PLAN THAT CREATES THEIR EXTINCTION I MEAN SELDOM DO THEY DO THAT ALSO AS A RESULT I THINK THAT'S WHY WE LOOK AT THE LA WAS KIND OF AN INDEPENDENT BODY. THAT'S LOOKING AT IT THAT WE'VE MADE A COMMENT LAST YEAR IN THE. IN THE BUDGET HEARINGS THAT. THAT CLEARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF REPAIRS THAT NEED TO BE MADE AND ONE OF OUR MY CONCERNS IT'S BEEN ALWAYS THAT. WE NEED TO KNOW. UP IF IT MAKING THE REPAIRS AT THE FACILITY SLOW LAST LONGER. IN TERMS OF THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION SO WHY BUILD A BRAND NEW ROOF ON A BUILDING THAT NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO SHUT DOWN. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS AND A WHAT I LOOKED AT THE LA GOALS ARE RECOMMENDATION WITH REGARDS TO NORCO PARTICULARLY. YOU KNOW THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT THAT THAT THE REPAIR ON THAT FACILITY IS IT'S ENORMOUS. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. EVENTUALLY SHUTTING DOWN A PRISON WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THOSE THAT LEVEL OF REPAIR. ON A ON A FACILITY IF IF YOU MAY END UP CLOSING THE FACILITY AND THAT ONE OBVIOUSLY HAS THE GREATEST NUMBER OF REPAIR ISSUES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO. I THINK LAST YEAR WE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO SAY IF WE WERE TO CLOSE A PRISON WHICH ONE WOULD BE CLOSE AND WHAT WILL BE THE CONDITION OF THE OF THE. PRISON THAT WE CLOSED AND I WORDS WE DON'T WANT TO REPAIR RULES ON TO A PLACE THAT'S GOING TO BE CLOSED I MEAN THAT KIND OF STUFF BECAUSE THE REST OF THE EXPENSIVE. OR TO GET INVOLVED IN A WHOLE LOT OF CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY IN THIS IN THAT ONLY TO DISCOVER. THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE PRISONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE I THINK LOOKING AT A PLAN. THAT IF WE MOVE IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION WHAT WHAT THAT PLAN LOOKED LIKE. AND DO WHAT RESOURCES MIGHT BE SAVED IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT. EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS ONLY THE BUDGET FOR. THIS DEPARTMENT HAS INCREASED SOMETIMES A ENORMOUSLY MUCH MORE THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS AND I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF POPULATION KEPT GROWING. AND WILL HEAL A BIT MORE ABOUT POPULATION IN A MINUTE THAT THE GUARDS TO WHY WE DID ALSO SEEMS TO BE GOING UP AND DOWN. IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. THAT VISION THAT IF WE ARE BOTH WITH GIVING SOMEONE ASKED IF YOU GET A MAKING PERMANENT POSITIONS ARE WE GONNA NEED THOSE PERMANENT POSITIONS. IN THE FUTURE AMID IF WE IF WE REDUCING POPULATION AND THE OTHER ISSUES DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH FOLKS RETIRING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT IF THERE IS A REDUCTION. I MEAN THOSE KINDS OF ARGUMENTS WOULD BE HELPFUL AYE IF WE LOOK AT THE POSITIONS BECAUSE IF THERE AYE IF PEOPLE THERE ARE A CERTAIN AGE IN MAY BE. LOOKING AT RETIREMENT AND X. THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS AND YOU BRING YOU KNOW PERMIT PEOPLE THEN THAT'S MAKES SENSE BUT IF YOU BRING UP PERMITS. INDIVIDUALS AND THERE'S NO. FOLKS RETIRING WITHIN GOD HAVE TO GET INVOLVED IN LAOS AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO LAYOFFS EVERYBODY GOES CRAZY OKAY. AND UP AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THAT THAT WE HAVE. SO I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AND. AND YOUR ENTHUSIASM FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING OBVIOUSLY PROP FIFTY SEVEN HAS ALL LOOKING. AT THINGS IT TO HOPEFULLY WILL BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PICTURE BUT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER ONE ON THE AGENDA THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND. THINK WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND FOR ITEM NUMBER ONE WHICH IS THE CDC OUR POPULATION OVERVIEW. OF WILL HAVE SOMEONE FROM. CDC ARE. HERE AS WELL AS APARTMENT FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OF WILL TAKE ITEMS ONE THROUGH SIX ALTOGETHER. I. SINCE OUT AGAIN WITH THEM BOTH WANT THE SIX I GIVE THE MEMBERS HERE AN OPPORTUNITY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF. THE INDIVIDUALS ON ITEMS ONE THROUGH SIX BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE PROBABLY JUST REPORTING OUT OF INFORMATION. AND THEN AFTER THAT IF THERE ARE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON EITHER ITEM ONE THROUGH SIX WE WILL. TAKE THOSE PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THAT TIME SO WE. THERE ARE PLEASE FILL WHICH ITEM YOU TALKING ABOUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ITEM SEVENTY NINE IT NEEDS EACH ONE OF THOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUAL COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. AND THEN FINALLY ITEMS TEN AND ELEVEN WE TAKEN TOGETHER AND THEY WILL BASICALLY HAVE COMMENTS ONLY AFTER THE END OF ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN SO I TRIED WILL TRY TO GIVE US WHAT MAKES SENSE OR NOT GOING BACK TO. BACK AND FORTH IN THE AUDIENCE WITH FOLKS OF FIGURING OUT WHO'S GOING TO COME AT WHAT TIME. PLEASE GIVE US YOUR NAME. AS WE GET A DEAL ITEM NUMBER ONE. THANK YOU COULD MORNING MADAM CHAIR. COMMITTEE MEMBERS JASON LOPEZ CDC ARE. AS YOU MENTIONED ITEM NUMBER ONE UP ON THE AGENDA IS OUR POPULATION OVER YOU. THE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TWICE A YEAR. OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH WILL PRODUCE OUR POPULATION ESTIMATES FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CLASS OF OFFENDERS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. I'M JOINED TODAY BY CHRIS CHAMBERS WHO IS OUR ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF OR OFFICE OF RESEARCH IS GONNA WALK YOU THROUGH QUICKLY AND OVERVIEW OF THAT AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. PART SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING DOCTOR WEBER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S CHRIS CHAMBERS AND I CURRENTLY SERVICE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH WITH. SEE OUR. THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH PREPARE CDC OURS ADULT. INSTITUTION AND PROP PROP ELATION FORECASTS AND I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO UPDATE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THESE PROJECTIONS. THE POPULATION PROJECTIONS ARE PREPARED TWICE ANNUALLY ONCE IN THE SPRING AND ONCE IN THE FALL OF EACH YEAR. THESE PROJECTIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING HISTORICAL TREND DATA AND TIME SERIES FORECASTING TECHNIQUES. OUR CURRENT VERSION IS THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FALL POPULATION PROJECTION REPORT. WHICH WAS JUST RELEASED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE ADULT BUT INSTITUTION POPULATION WAS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY OFFENDERS. ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARE PROJECTION FOR JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR OFFENDERS THIS IS A ONE YEAR DE INCREASE OF NEARLY THREE THOUSAND OFFENDERS ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT THREE PERCENT. AS OF OUR LAST WEEK WE PUBLISHED REPORT. FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE ADULT INSTITUTION POPULATION STANDS AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND. FOUR HUNDRED AND THREE. ANNUALLY ADULT INSTITUTION POPULATION GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DECLINING IN THE NEXT TO BUDGET CYCLES. CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE AS PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN. ENHANCE CREDIT EARNING. THESE ENHANCEMENTS BEGAN AFFECTING THE FENDER POPULATION AT THE END OF JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WHICH STARTS THE FAULT TWENTY SEVENTEEN POPULATION PROJECTION CYCLE. SINCE OUR ACTUAL RELEASE DATE IS STILL IN THE BEGINNING STAGES WE RECOMMEND CAUTION BE EMPLOYED WHEN INTERPRETING. THESE VERY EARLY PROJECTIONS. PLEASE KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUALLY REFINES OUR LOGIC STAYING ABREAST WITH CURRENT INSTITUTION ENVIRONMENT. WHERE DOES THIS PUT US IN THIS WERE DISCUSSED BUT THE STATE INTO YOUR SAY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY? THE DOT INSTITUTION POPULATIONS PROJECTED AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE. FOR JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. THIS PROJECTION WOULD RESULT IN A TWO YEAR DECREASE OF TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN OFFENDERS. MOVING TO PEROT PROJECTIONS APPROPRIATION WAS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE. AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OUR PROJECTION FOR JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN. THIS IS A ONE YEAR INCREASE OF SEVEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT. FROM HERE THE PRO POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE FURTHER IN THE NEXT TO BUDGET CYCLES. AS FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PAROLE POPULATION STANDS FOR FORTY SIX THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE. A DOCTOR WEBER AND BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM SECOND. OKAY THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS HERE. IF I COULD JUST PROVIDE  LITTLE MORE CONTEXT FOR THE NUMBER SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE GONNA SEE AS MISTER CHAMBERS IS GOING THROUGH HIS NUMBERS AND YOU'RE COMPARING THEM TO THE NUMBERS THAT YOU SEE IN THE BUDGET. IS OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH OFTEN DEALS WITH POINT IN TIME DATA WHERE. THE BUDGET IS BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE. TWO NUMBERS. PART OF FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS. NOTHING AT THIS TIME DILIO. CAITLYN O'NEILL LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I IN GENERAL WE WITHHOLD OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT POPULATION DRIVEN BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS AND TELL THEM A REVISION. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANNED TO ACCOMMODATE THE ANTICIPATED POPULATION REDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN. AND WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECTIONS OF THE IMPACT OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN ON THE INMATE POPULATION. HOWEVER WE THINK THAT THE INMATE POPULATION DECLINE THAT THEY'RE PROJECTING. PRESENTS THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES. AND WE FIND. THAT CDC ARE COULD CLOSE A STATE PRISON AND STILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT. REDUCTION IN THESE ABOUT A STATE CONTRACT BEDS BY CLOSING THE FACILITY IN MISSISSIPPI. HOWEVER TO DO THAT AND TO MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF OVERCROWDING IN OUR STATE OWNED AND OPERATED PRISONS AS WOULD BE MAINTAINED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE ARIZONA CONTRACT. ONE POSSIBLE PRISON TO CLOSE AS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY IS THE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN NORCO. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY THAT GOVERN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED CLOSING IN THE PAST DUE TO ITS DETERIORATING INFRASTRUCTURE AND AT THAT TIME. AS MADE IT WOULD COST OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO FULLY RENOVATE. WE ESTIMATE THAT CLOSING THE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER AND THE MISSISSIPPI CONTRACT FACILITY WOULD EVENTUALLY RESULT IN ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN AND. SAVINGS RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. I WOULD ALSO AVOID THE NEED TO RENOVATE CRC. HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ON OUR PROPOSAL COULD TEMPORARILY RESULT IN LOWER SAVINGS MATH RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN WHILE CRC IS BEING CLOSED. BUT IN THE LONG TERM WE EXPECT THE SAVINGS WOULD GREATLY EXCEED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER DIRECTING STYLE CDC ARE TO CLOSE YOUR SEE AND THE MISSISSIPPI FACILITY. INSTEAD OF CLOSING BOTH OUT OF STATE CONTRACT FACILITIES IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES. TO CLOSE YEAR SEE WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE IT WITH THE PLAN ON THE PRINT ON THE CLOSURE. IF IT DECIDES NOT TO CLOSE YEAR SEE WE RECOMMEND DIRECTING CDC ARE TO PROVIDE IT WITH A PLAN TO MAKE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT CRC. AND MADAM CHAIR OF NOW IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME I'D BE GLAD TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THAT ABOUT CONCERNS THAT SECRETARY KERN AND BROUGHT UP. SO FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT AWARE OF A COURT ORDER THAT REQUIRES THE STATE TO ELIMINATE ITS USE OF OUT OF STATE CONTRACT FACILITIES. HOWEVER THIS THE COURT HAS ORDERED THE STATE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE LEVELS OF HEALTH CARE TO INMATES. AND BECAUSE SEE ARE SEE WHAT'S UP PLAN FOR CLOSURE IN THE PAST AND NEVER RECEIVED A HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AS MANY OTHER PRISONS HAVE. ANY FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN COURT ORDER WHICH I BELIEVE THE SECRETARY WAS REFERRING TO AND THE COURT SAID THAT DEFENDANTS SHALL EXPLORE WAYS TO ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES HOUSED IN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE. SINCE THAT TIME THE STATE HAS REDUCED ITS EAT AT RICH IT'S. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES IN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES BY MORE THAN HALF. AND UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE FOR A APPROACH THAT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THE STATE WOULD BE CONTINUING TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE USE OF OUT OF STATE CONTRACT BEDS. IN LESS THE INMATE POPULATION DECREASES UNEXPECTEDLY BEYOND WHAT IS ANTICIPATED BY PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN AS A RESULT OF TOP PROPOSITIONS FIFTY SEVEN. THIS STATE WILL HAVE TO UNDERTAKE COSTLY REPAIRS RENOVATIONS AT CRC TO MAKE IT FEASIBLE TO CONTINUE HOUSING INMATES THERE IN THE LONG TERM. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROPOSED A PLAN TO DO SO. AND THEN SECOND ON THE ON THE CONCERNS ABOUT INMATES BEING FURTHER FARTHER AWAY FROM FAMILIES IN WHILE IN ME ARIZONA FACILITY. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW TO KNOW THAT. FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE INMATE POPULATION WAS COMMITTED. FROM LA COUNTY AND LOS ANGELES IS ABOUT A SEVEN HOUR DRIVE FROM ELY ARIZONA WHERE THAT WHERE THE CONTRACT FACILITY IS LOCATED. AND NOT AND THERE ARE THREE STATE PRISONS THAT ARE GREATER THAN A THREE HOUR DRIVE FROM. LOS ANGELES SO IT'S IT'S REASONABLE TO THINK THAT IF IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER MOVE OUT OF THE OUT OF STATE FACILITY IS ACTUALLY FARTHER FOR MANY PEOPLE'S FAMILIES. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS OKAY. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS IN ONE. YEAH EXCEPT I'VE HAD LITTLE CHAMADA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET ACT IT'S JUST A DELAYED CLOSURE AS THIS IS STILL CONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS PLAN. AND. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF SEARS HE'S INFRASTRUCTURE IS STILL BEING COMPLETED AYE AND WON'T BE COMPLETED UNTIL THE END OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WHICH WOULD TELL US SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THEIR. AND AS SECRETARY CURLY NOTED I. CONTINUING THE USE OF OUT OF STATE DISS NEITHER DESIRABLE NOR A DURABLE SOLUTION. SO YOU SAYING THAT THE ACTUAL ANALYSIS OF THE OF THE REPAIRS AND NEEDS WILL NOT BE DONE UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR. SEC WRECKED THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND SHOULD UNDERSTAND. OH OKAY I I THOUGHT THAT. I MEAN THIS PRISONERS BEEN ON THE. DISCUSSION AND CHOPPING BLOCK WE'VE ME FLY WAS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE SO I'M TRYING TO. HAVE SOMEONE WAS TO MADE SOME ASSESSMENT THERE AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME FORM OF AN ASSESSMENT DONE AND I THINK A MACHINE MISSED ISHIMOTO IS REFERRING TO. WE SECURE FUNDING. EITHER LAST YEAR OR THE YEAR BEFORE TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THE NEEDS THAT ARE TWELVE ALL THIS PRISONS. SEE OUR SAMPLING ONE OF THOSE SO THE MORE FORMAL ASSESSMENT THAT SHE'S REFERRING TO WILL BE READY YOU KNOW CALDERON HERE. THANK YOU UPS RIGHT BECAUSE I SOMEWHERE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME. NUMBERS IN DISCUSSIONS OF SCOPE OF WHAT MARCO INSIDE AT TIMES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. OKAY. WE WERE DOING A NEW ONE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE UPDATE. IN PART FIFTY SEVEN IS GOING TO HELP THE STATE REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION BUT I UNDERSTAND IT THE FELON IN MISSIONS ARE GOING UP. DO WE HAVE A REASON UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE FACTORS DRIVING THESE INCREASES. MADAM CHAIRMAN AT THIS POINT I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION CAN GET BACK TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THAT OKAY. LOOK FOR TO THAT INFORMATION WITH US BECAUSE WE WERE. WE WANT TO KNOW WE DON'T. BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT'S HAPPENING THAT'S CAUSING PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO COMMIT MORE CRIMES OF MORE FELONIES. OF RELATING WHAT ONE TWO AND WAS STILL BRINGING IN THE WHOLE TRUTH THE OTHER DIRECTION. A WHICH WOULD OBVIOUSLY PUT A SET UP MINUS INTO BLOGGING IF I CAN ADD WE NOTED INCREASE IN ADMISSIONS STARTING IN THE LATTER HALF OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. OF ALL DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED COMMITMENTS BUT A GREATER INCREASED WAS OBSERVED AT SECOND STRIKER COMBAT. COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR ALTHOUGH THAT CONTINUE THE LAST YEAR WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS SOMEWHAT FLATTENED OUT. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH. TIME THAT HAS PROGRESSED TO ACTUALLY GIVE IT A FAIR TREND ANALYSIS ON THAT WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO GO BACK. AND GET MORE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. BUT WE ARE CONTINUING TO ENGAGE IN BROADER ANALYSIS OF OF IN REVIEW OF CRIME GOAL. OF CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE TRENDS. OKAY WILL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THAT THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS APPEAR. ITEM NUMBER TWO. ISSUE NUMBER TWO. VARIATIONS ON STANDARD AYE STAFFING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWO. YOU. YOU ALL ARE USED TO SEEING THIS. JUSTMAN EVERY YEAR TO OUR SENATE AYE STAFFING PACKAGE YOU'LL RECALL THAT. BACK IN THE BLUEPRINT WE ESTABLISHED THE STANDARD AYE STAFFING METHODOLOGY. IN ORDER TO. ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT MORE EFFICIENTLY RUN OUR PRISONS. AND MORE EFFECTIVELY RUN OUR PRISONS THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL INVOLVES AND I REQUEST FOR FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY ONE POINT SIX POSITIONS INCLUDING CEOS AND SERGEANTS. MAJORITY THE POSITIONS ARE TIED TO STAFFING. THE COMPLETED EXCEPT PROJECTS AT A VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DETAILED IN YOUR AGENDA. AND. I HAVE WITH ME JUST FOR BREAD AND WHO IS THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS SHE'S GONNA RIDE A JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OUR STANDARD AYE STAFFING INSTITUTION STAFFING REQUEST. PROVIDES THE REQUIRED PEACE OFFICER STAFFING COMPLEMENT FRUIT SELECT ADULT INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SECURITY COVERAGE NEEDED FOR MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AREAS AS WELL AS PROGRAMMING AREAS FOR THE INMATE POPULATION. THE STAFFING RESOURCES WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN OR IDENTIFIED IN PRIOR REVIEWS. THEY ARE TIGHT TO OUR HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT WHERE AT THE TIME WE LOOKED AT THE BLUEPRINT DESIGN OF THE BUILDING. AND WERE NOT AWARE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A NEED FOR STAFFING RESOURCES BASED ON THE BLUEPRINT VIEW AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN BUILT. HAS YIELDED A NEED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL STAFFING RESOURCE IN THIS AS THE INMATE POPULATION WILL BE IN AREAS WE HAD NOT ANTICIPATED. IN ADDITION THAT WE HAD SOME AREAS WHERE PREVIOUSLY IN REVIEWS WE WERE NOT PROGRAMMING INMATES AND NOW WE HAVE PROGRAMS FOR THE INMATES THERE AND REQUIRE THE SECURITY COVERAGE. AS WELL AS OUR EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION THAT HAPPENS ON THIRD WATCH WE ARE PROVIDING THE STAFFING RESOURCES TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON IN THE PROGRAMS WHEN STAFF ARE REPURPOSE TO PERFORM AN EMERGENCY TRANSPORT. I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE HAS TODAY. DAILY COMMENTS FROM. PART OF FINANCE. BELIAU. NO COMMENTS. ANY COMMENTS FROM UP HERE. MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER THREE. ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH READ SOURCES. YOU'LL HAVE TO PARDON THE MUSICAL CHAIRS BUT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE SOME PEOPLE MAKING A SECOND APPEARANCE STARTING WITH MISTER CHAMBERS FROM OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH SO. WITH THIS PROPOSAL. CAESAR'S OFFICE OF RESEARCH REQUEST SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SIX POSITIONS ON GOING STARTING IN BUDGET YEAR. CONSISTING OF ONE RESEARCH PROGRAM SPECIALIST ONE RESEARCH SPECIALIST ONE SENIOR INFORMATION SYSTEM ANALYST. TO A. GPAS AND ONE OFFICE TECHNICIAN AND AGAIN I'M JOINED BY MISTER CHAMBERS FROM OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH WHO CAN PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON THE PROPOSAL. GOOD MORNING AGAIN. THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH FUNCTIONS AS THE DEPARTMENTS RESEARCH CHARM AND SERVES AS A PRIMARY DATA PROVIDER FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CD SEE OUR CLIENTS. IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS UNDERGONE DRAMATIC CHANGE IN PRISON REFORM IN MANDATE POPULATION REDUCTION MEASURES. THIS CHANGE HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN INTEREST AND DEMAND. ACROSS THE BOARD IN ALL AREAS FOR CORRESPONDING DATA. WHILE THERE'S BEEN A NEAR SIXTY PERCENT INCREASE IN A RECENT YEARS FOR SPECIALIZED TYPE REQUEST. WHICH EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY FORTY PERCENT OF OUR OVERALL WORKLOAD. THERE HAS BEEN NO CORRESPONDING INCREASE TO POSITION ALLOCATIONS AND BUDGET. THIS AUGMENTATION THAT WE'RE REQUESTING WOULD ALLOW THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES TOWARDS. INCLUDING CRITICAL WORKLOAD IN CLOSING THE GAPS. FOR THAT PURPOSE WE HAVE REQUESTED SIX PERMANENT. P. WISE TO ADDRESS OUR ONGOING WORKLOAD INCREASE. THESE POSITIONS OUR RESEARCH SPECIALIST GENERAL ANALYSTS AND ONE NIGHT HE CLASSIFICATION. THESE POSITIONS AGAIN A REPRESENT AN ACROSS THE BOARD NEED TO PROVIDE RESEARCH AND ANALYTICS. DATA COLLECTION GENERAL DATA ANALYSIS PREPARATION AND QUALITY REVIEW. WELL OUR BCP NOTED. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED REQUEST EACH MONTH. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE ACTUAL LAST FOR MONTHS IS AN INCREASE TO EVEN THAT NUMBER NOW WE'RE AVERAGING CLOSER TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY REQUEST? FOR MONTHS FOR DATA. THIS PY AUGMENTATION WILL ENABLE US TO PROVIDE MORE EXPEDITIOUS RISK MORE EXPEDITIOUS RESPONSE. AND ALSO TO FURTHER DELVE INTO THAT MEETING IN INTERRELATION OF THE DATA WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO AT THIS POINT. I THINK MADAM CHAIR YOU HAD ASKED EARLIER ABOUT. THE INCREASE IN FELON POPULATION IN WHY. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS WOULD HELP US TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO IN A QUICKER MANNER. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM. FOR AND FINANCE ILIO. YEAH ONE OF HERE. OKAY THIS TO ITEM TO LIKE THE OTHERS WILL BE HELD OVER PULLED THE FUND ITEM NUMBER FOUR CONSISTS. ROLE NONRACIAL PROGRAM PORTIONS POSITIONS AS HE'S. FROM. THAT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK WE'RE ACHIEVING IT SO FAR SO I HOPE I DIDN'T USE THAT BY SAYING THAT BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY AND STAY ON TRACK WITH THAT SO LIKE A PLAN. NEXT UP IS. A PROPOSAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY THREE POSITIONS FOR ARE DAVID DIVISION OF ADULT FOR ALL OPERATIONS. THESE ARE SUPPORT POSITIONS THAT HAD BEEN ELIMINATED AND OUR BLUEPRINT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. AT THE TIME OF THE BLUEPRINT THERE WAS. ANTICIPATION THAT ARE POORLY POPULATION BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS GOING TO DECLINE TO ABOUT TWENTY ABOUT TWENTY NINE THOUSAND AND AS YOU'VE HEARD NOW A COUPLE OF TIMES. OUR ACTUAL BUDGET YEAR PROJECTIONS ARE CLOSER TO FIFTY THOUSAND SO OBVIOUSLY A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO NUMBERS O WITH THAT IN MIND. THE DEPARTMENT IS ASKING FOR OTHERS TWENTY THREE POSITIONS THAT ARE LAID OUT ON YOUR AGENDA I'M JOINED BY. DIRECTOR JERRY POWERS FROM OUR DIVISION OF ADULT PEARL OPERATIONS IS GONNA PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT FOR THE PROPOSAL THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING MORNING MEMBERS IS SAID JASON SAID JERRY POWER STAFFORD DIRECTOR THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING I WILL BE BRIEF. JUST TO PUT IN CONTEXT AND I APOLOGIZE SIR OF AN I'M SORRY MISTER TING IS IN HERE TO TALK ABOUT RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WE HAVE. AS JASON SAID WE WERE ESSENTIALLY ZERO BASED ABOUT BUDGETED DE UM FIVE YEARS AGO SIX YEARS AGO. TO A POPULATION ANTICIPATED POPULATION SOMEWHERE AROUND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND OR SO OUR POPULATION CURRENTLY IS SOMEWHERE FORTY SIX TO FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND GROWING TO FIFTY THOUSAND SHORTLY. AYE IN THAT TIME ARE ARE NO I'M SWORN PERSONNEL ARE SUPPORT SUPER SPUR SINGLE SERVICES THAT ARE NON RATIOS POSITIONS HAVE NOT GROWN WITH THE POPULATION WHEREAS OUR OUR PAROLE AGENT POSITIONS WHICH ARE RATIO WOULD. TO THE PAROLE POPULATION HAVE INCREASED INCREMENTALLY AS THE POPULATION HAS INCREASED. I'M JUST TO GIVE YOU A BENCHMARK IDEA OF WHAT THAT WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS. IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OUR POPULATION FOR ALL POPULATION WAS ABOUT FORTY SIX THOUSAND AND WE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FOUR NON RATIO SUPPORT POSITIONS IN IN THAT APARTMENT. OUR CURRENT POPULATION IS SOMEWHERE AROUND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND SO WHEN TALKING TRYING TO GET AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN NON SOME NON RACIAL POSITIONS ARE SUPPORT POSITIONS. SO WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POSITIONS BELOW WHERE THE POPPY IF YOU COMPARE THOSE POPULATIONS ARM. TODAY SO BOMB. THE JUSTIFICATION SIMPLY HAS PASSED AS THE PAROLE POPULATION GROWS AS WE AB PAROLE AGENTS THERE IS SIGNIFICANT WORK THAT GOES BEHIND THAT. TO THE ALEJO'S. SUGGESTION A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE TURN ON RACIAL POSITIONS INTO RATIO POSITIONS CERTAINLY THAT IS THAT IS ONE APPROACH TO TO TO TO THIS. AYE IT ALMOST PUTS US ON AUTOPILOT AS FAR AS BUDGETING AND AND PERSONNEL GOES. IT'S EASY TO DO WITH PAROLE POSITIONS BECAUSE FOR EVERY PAROLE  <u><c.green>YOU CAN YOU CAN</c></u> DETERMINE HOW MANY YOU UP FOR ALLEGIANCE YOU NEED. BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY GOT MENU OF OF SUPPORT POSITIONS TO DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE WORKMEN'S COMP AND BACKGROUNDS IN STAFF TRAINING IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO RATIO THOSE KINDS OF POSITIONS ADDITIONALLY AS THINGS CHANGE REGULATIONS CHANGE LAWS CHANGE. EVEN AUTOMATION COMES ON BOARD SOME OF THOSE RATIOS BECOME. UNNECESSARILY HIGH OR UNNECESSARILY LOW. IN THAT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND CONSTANTLY ADJUST THE RATIOS OR IN MY EXPERIENCE OVER THIRTY PLUS YEARS WHAT WE DO IS WE START SWAPPING. I'LL GIVE YOU UP I'LL GIVE UP TO OF THESE POSITIONS IN THE RATIO TO GET ONE OF THESE. FOR INSTANCE AS WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY DID HIS IMPROVED FOR MY PAROLE AGENTS. WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED PEOPLE TO MANUALLY ENTER CASE NOTES AND TO FILE THINGS BECAUSE NOW IT'S ELECTRONIC. THE BACKSIDE OF THAT IS WE NEED MORE IT SUPPORT. SO WHAT WHAT WE IF WE HAD RATIO THOSE POSITIONS FIVE YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT TODAY. SO BY US COMING TO YOU AND ASKING FOR RATIO DIFFER NONRACIAL POSITIONS WE REALLY YOU'RE JUST TO FIND THOSE POSITIONS BASED ON THE ACTUAL WORKLOAD THAT WE SEE VERSUS SORT OF ON AUTOPILOT SORT OF BUDGETING. AND STAFF ALLOCATIONS SO I THOUGHT I'D CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ANY COMMENTS ROOM FINANCE BELIAU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JONATHAN PETERSON AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS THE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THEY HAVE THEIR DIRECT SUPERVISION POSITIONS WHICH THEY ANNUALLY ADJUST IN THE BUDGET DEPENDING ON. THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE PROBABLY POPULATION AND THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT POSITIONS WHICH THEY HAVE TYPICALLY REQUESTED ON AN AD HOC BASIS. SO WE RECOMMEND THE DEPARTMENT UTILIZE A RATIO DRIVEN APPROACH FOR THE SUPPORT POSITIONS THAT TAKES INTO. ACCOUNT THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE PEARLY POPULATION FOR BOTH DIRECT SUPERVISION AND THE SUPPORT POSITIONS. AND RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CDS YARD REPORTED BUDGET HEARINGS ON A PLAN TO INCORPORATE THESE SUPPORT POSITIONS INTO THE ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT. AN IMPENDING SUCH A REPORT AS WELL AS THE UPDATED POPULATION PROJECTIONS THAT COME WITH THE MAY REVISION WE WITHHOLD RECOMMENDATION ON THE. RIVER PACIFIC NUMBER OF POSITIONS REQUESTED BOTH ON THE DIRECT SUPERVISION AND ON THE SUPPORT SIDE. AND WHILE IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THE SUPPORT POSITIONS ARE NOT AS DIRECTLY TIED TO SPECIFIC CASELOADS AS YOUR DIRECT SUPERVISION PRO AGENTS. THAT'S AN APARTMENT INDICATED THEY STILL ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE PROPERLY POPULATION FOR EXAMPLE PART OF THESE POSITIONS IS TO ADDRESS THE TEMPORARY INCREASE IN POPULATION THAT'S EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN. I AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HOW DOES USE RATIOS THAT DON'T ADJUST. BASED ON SPECIFIC CASELOADS FOR OTHER POSITIONS ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE FOR EVERY TWO THOUSAND INMATES THE DEPARTMENT OF IT GETS ANOTHER DENTAL HYGIENIST. SO THERE AREN'T RATIOS THAT AREN'T ADD AS I AM I GUESS FLY AYE AREN'T AS SMALL AS SAY A TWENTY TO ONE RATIO WE USE FOR OUR HIGH RISK SEX OFFENDER PAROLEES. AND THAT THE IN THE CASE OF THE HUMAN RESOURCE ANALYSTS AS YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PRO AGENTS YOU DO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU NEED TO REQUEST ANALYSTS AND AND THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL THEY SAY THEY WANT TO KEEP. THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS AT AROUND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PER ANALYSTS SO THEY DO HAVE AN EFFECT A RATIO BUILT IN FOR THAT SO WERE ASKING FOR A PLAN TO KIND OF. PUT THOSE INTO THE ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT AND. TO HELP. ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN THE POPULATION OVER TIME. YOU COLLECTIONS APPEAR. OKAY. I HAD SAID THE QUESTION CONCERNING THAT AND I THINK YOU ANSWERED IT AND AND IN BOTH OF YOUR COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO WHY WOULD YOU WANT A. OF WHY WE MADE ONE OF RACIAL DRIVEN UP POSITIONS VERSUS NON RACIAL. DRIVEN POSITIONS AND SO LEFT FIT THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. YEAH THAT THAT ITEM ALSO WILL BE HELD OVER AND SHOW. YOU ABOUT IT TO ME REVISION ITEM NUMBER FIVE REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS. PAUSING MOMENTARILY FOR MY NEW SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT TO JOIN ME AT THE TABLE. OKAY WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTEEN MANAGEMENT SERVICE TECHNICIAN POSITIONS ON GOING STARTING IN BUDGET YEAR. THESE MST IS WOULD BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR FACILITATING AND TRACKING IN MAY PARTICIPATION IN THOSE. RACKS AS WE LIKE TO REFER TO THEM. I'M JOINED AGAIN BY MISS BARRETTO FROM OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WHO CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION WILL ANSWER ANY. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND STAFF RESOURCES TO EXPAND OUR REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDIT PROGRAM BY INCREASING OUR ENEMY ACTIVITY GROUPS. RESULTS IN THE INMATE POPULATION. EARNING ADDITIONAL CREDITS. WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN A REDUCTION ON THEIR SENTENCE AND TIME IN PRISON. THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS PROVIDE FOR CONSISTENT AND STABLE WORKFORCE WHEN PROGRAMS ARE MOST FREQUENTLY RUNNING WHICH TYPICALLY IS ON THIRD WATCH ON WEEKENDS. THE POSITIONS WILL BE UTILIZED AN THE INSTITUTIONS WITH THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE THE ESSENTIAL. OF SUPERVISION OF OUR VOLUNTEERS AND TRACKING IN COORDINATION OF ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS IN ADDITION IT ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL HOURS OF THE RACKS PROGRAM. EARNINGS I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU ME HOW BEEN THE COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. BELIAU. THE APPEAR. OKAY FUND THANK YOU THAT I AM TO WILL BE HELD OVER GO TO ITEM NUMBER SIX FOLLOWING THIS OF THEIR ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON ONE THROUGH SIX. WE WILL HAVE YOUR COMMENTS AT THAT TIME. INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING GRANTS. OKAY. WITH THE PROPOSAL RELATED TO OUR INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING GRANTS THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING SIX SORRY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR INMATE WELFARE FUND. ONGOING STARTING IN BUDGET YEAR TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THIS PROGRAM. THAT WE STARTED JUST. THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO I BELIEVE IT WAS. ACTUALLY. IT'S IN MY NOTES IF I'D READ MY NOTES I KNOW THAT SO WE STAB US BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THROUGH AN INVESTMENT. OF BOTH IWF AND OUR R. F. RECIDIVISM REDUCTION FUND MONIES BACK THEN SO. ARE THE LATEST INVESTMENT IS SITTING AT ABOUT EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND I SCHEDULED TO BE REDUCED TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN TO GO TO ZERO AND TWENTY TWENTY THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISHED A FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FROM INMATE WELFARE FUND FOR THE SUPPORT OF THOSE GRANTS. I'M JOINED BY RYAN SOUSA. WHO IS OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITHIN OUR DIVISION OF REAL BILL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS? AYE MR SUSE IS GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON THE PROPOSAL AND THEN WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING. OF MY OWN HERE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. MY INSURANCE IS A AGAIN I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION EVERY ABILITY TO PROGRAMS AYE AYES JASON REFERENCE. DID THE FUNDING IS ENDING TOWARDS THESE GRANT PROGRAMS AND THAT THE DIVISION IS GONE BACK AND LOOKED AT HIM IN TOTAL AND THE POSITIVE BUT ANECDOTAL INFORMATION AND JUST. THAT THAT'S. THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN SURROUNDING GIVING PROGRAMMING AS A HOLISTIC FEEL TO THE OFFENDER POPULATION SO. HERE WE REQUESTED A CONTINUATION OF THIS GRANT. AND WE'VE MORE NARROW THE FOCUS IN TERMS OF JUST APPLYING GRANTS AYE DO THAT WITH. SIXTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT SPLIT HAS PROPOSED TO FOCUS ON THOSE GRANTS THAT ARE. BOTH ADHERING TO PROMISING PRACTICES ON AND I'LL GO THROUGH A KIND OF. THREE STEP ON ON AN OVERVIEW OF HOW. GRANTS OR EVEN TREATMENT PROGRAMMING COULD BE APPLIED IN GENERAL WE ALL HEAR THE TERM EVIDENCE BASED. THAT PRACTICE IS REALLY BASED ON RIGOROUS RESEARCH THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED PRACTICES THAT ARE ACHIEVING THE OUTCOMES NECESSARY A LOWER LEVEL TO DINE ON AND THE AND THE WHERE WERE FOCUSING SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR GRANTS IS PROMISING PRACTICES. THOSE ARE NOT SIMILAR TO OUR PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES THAT HAVE SOME SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BUT HAVEN'T NECESSARILY BEEN RIGOROUSLY RESEARCHED EVIDENCE BASED SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS TAKING SOME ELEMENTS OF THOSE. I'M AND FOCUS IT ON THE CORRECTIONAL PROGRAM CHECKLIST IN BOTH THE CRITERIA AND GRANT APPLICATION THAT GOES AN AFFRONT WE'VE BUILT IN KIND OF THOSE CHECKS AND BALANCES AFFRONT TO GET APPLICANTS. THAT HAVE THOSE PROMISING PRACTICES KIND OF BUILT INTO THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE RECEIVED AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ALSO HOW WE GREAT THOSE. AND IN THE LATTER PORTION THE SECONDARY AND FINAL TIER OF OUR GRANTS ARE THE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT THERE REALLY CAN'T PRACTICE BASED GRANTS THOSE ARE. USING COMMON PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES THAT ON MAY LEAD TO PROMISING PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE BUT REALLY JUST EVIDENCE THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE A POSITIVE RESULT AND THAT STILL ALLOWS TRUE INNOVATION IN OUR GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH IS WHY WE FEEL LIKE IT IS REALLY NECESSARY REHABILITATION NOT EVERYONE NEEDS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF KEY MEMBER REALLY GETS. A PLETHORA OF. TREATMENT AVAILABLE AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO THESE OFFENDERS DURING THE ENTIRE COURSE AN INCARCERATION. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE GRANT PROGRAMS ARE PRACTICES. IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. WRITTEN RAIN APARTMENT FINANCED THE HIGHLIGHT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ESTABLISH AN ONGOING AND SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL GRANT PROGRAM. AND REALLY BRINGING THE COMMUNITIES INTO THE PRESIDENT TO. DUTIES INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS OKAY. ELLIOTT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHAN PETERSON WHAT THE LA SHOW. UP AS A DEPARTMENT INDICATED THEY'RE FOCUSING THESE GRANTS AT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST AND PART OF THAT IS TO FOCUS ON PROGRAMS THAT HAVE. BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE SOME LEVEL OF. EFFECTIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAMMING STRATEGIES USING THE CHECKLIST MENTION. WE RECOMMEND RATHER THAN FOCUS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE GRANT FUNDING ON THOSE PROGRAMS USING THIS CHECKLIST TO FOCUS ON ALL HUNDRED PER FOCUS UP ALL ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FUNDING. ON THOSE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN. CONNECTED WITH EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE GREATEST IMPACT ON REDUCING CRIME AND ALSO INCREASING. THE BENEFITS TO THE STATE. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT. FOCUS THEIR SCORING METHODOLOGY WHICH IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT ON RECIDIVISM REDUCTION MEANING THAT RECIDIVISM REDUCTION WOULD BECOME THE TOP SCORING CRITERIA AND THAT. FRAMEWORK WHEN IT'S DEVELOPED AND FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED APARTMENT TO AWARD FUTURE GRANTS. BASED ON THE RESULTS THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT CURRENTLY RECEIVE FUNDING ARE THAT WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM WOULD CREATE AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT EFFECTIVELY REDUCE RECIDIVISM. CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THIS FUNDING MOVING FORWARD. AND. WHILE THE REMAINING PROGRAMS WHAT. THE DEPARTMENT REFERRED TO AS YOUR PRACTICE SPACE PROGRAMS THEY COULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE. IN THE PRISONS USING OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING WHICH IS% HOW THEY WERE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WERE FUNDED IN THE PAST AS THEY WERE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SUSTAINABILITY IN PREVIOUS ROUNDS OF GRANT FUNDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FUND IS ONE OF THE COMET YES JUST HEARD. TO SPEAK GONDOLIERS POINTS WE JUST WANNA KNOW THAT WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND. EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM IN THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS GRANT PROGRAM IS TO TRULY ALLOW. NONPROFITS TO COME IN AND BE INNOVATIVE AND ALLOW COMMUNITIES INTO THE PRESENCE WHO MAYBE HAVEN'T DEMONSTRATED THOSE. HAVEN'T REACHED THAT LEVEL OF EVIDENCE BASED. OKAY WECOME IT'S APPEAR. OKAY. A AYE I UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL BE ATTEMPTING TO ACCOMPLISH IN I THINK GO OUR FOCUS SHOULD ALWAYS BEEN RECIDIVISM. AND THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND I KNOW THE NEED FOR INNOVATION ONCE YOU. OBVIOUSLY. MAYBE BEING. HAVING A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM OUGHT TO BE THERE BASIS BUT WHICH GIVING ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR CONTINUING THE FUNDING. INNOVATION IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT A BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE STANDARDS THAT WE EVALUATE THOSE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE THE FUNDING FOR THEM SO WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THAT I THINK. BOTH OF YOU PROBABLY GETTING AT THAT POINT AND SO I THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT IT CAN. DO THE COMPARISON A SIXTY FIVE TO A HUNDRED PERCENT IN TERMS OF HOW WE'VE FUND PROGRAMS WHERE I THINK ANY CONTINUATION OF FUNDING. HAS TO BE BASED ON THE STANDARDS THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO THE JOB THAT WE SAY THEY'RE DOING OTHERWISE WE JUST GIVING MONEY TO UP PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT WHAT WE WANT WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THE FOLKS ARE NOT COMING BACK AND TO GIVE THEM THE SKILLS AND THE. SOFT SKILLS AND HARD SKILLS AS WELL TO. STAY OUT CAME ANY QUESTIONS ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR COMMENTS IS I I WOULD JUST LIKE TO COMMENT AYE WE A HUNDRED PERCENT AGREE WITH YOU AND THE DIVISION. AND I THINK WE AGREE WITH THE LA WAS ASSESSMENT PART OF HOW WE DEVELOPED ON THIS GRANT PROPOSAL IS REALLY BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP A SCORING CRITERIA BOTH. IN THE END WHEN WE'RE AWARDING GRANTS TO FOCUS ON THOSE EXACT FACTORS AS MORE INFORMATION COMES TO. ITS FINALITY IN TERMS OF RESEARCH SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN. AND WE HAVE ONE PERSON WHO'S GOING TO ADDRESS THAT IS NOT WHAT ITEM YOU ADDRESSING. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON JIM WHEN BURKE WITH THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA. WERE ALL FOR CLOSING PRISONS WERE ALL FOR BRINGING. ENDING OUR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUT OF STATE PRISONS. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY WHEN WE WOULD BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION WHEN I CAME HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THE POPULATION WAS. JUST UNDER A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND. IT'S ALSO VERY REFRESHING TO HEAR ALL OF THE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF REHABILITATION AND I KNOW SOME REALLY GOOD WORK. IS HAPPENING. IN THE DEPARTMENT THERE. WHEN WE DO TALK ABOUT CLOSING PRISONS. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE OLDER PRISONS WERE CONSTRUCTED. NEAR URBAN AREAS AND UNFORTUNATELY OF THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT CLOSING. AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT PRISONS IN URBAN AREAS OTHERS MUCH BETTER ACCESS. TWO ATTORNEYS TO FAMILY OF VISITATION AND SO FORTH AND COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS. PROGRAMS AT ONE TIME ONE OF EVERY FOUR COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS. WAS A VOLUNTEER AT SAN QUENTIN. PRISON AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT CLOSING SO. WHEN WE DO TALK ABOUT CLOSING. PRISONS WE HOPE IT WILL KEEP REHABILITATION AND MINE AND THE IMPORTANCE A GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY TO. TO URBAN AREAS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS THE INMATE PAY. AND WE'LL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS AFTER SEVEN LEVEL ALSO HAVE TO EIGHT AND AFTER NINE. INMATE PAY. OKAY. WITH MAY PAY. SO. SEE SEE OURS DIVISION ADULT INSTITUTIONS IS REQUESTING ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING STARTING IN BUDGET YEAR TO INCREASE AND MADE PAY RATES FOR OUR PLANT OPERATIONS POSITION SPECIFICALLY. FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THOSE RATES TO A LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH THOSE ALREADY. A PRESENT FOR OUR PRISON INDUSTRY AUTHORITY AND OUR ENEMY WORD LABOR JOBS. I'M JOINED AGAIN BY MISS BARRETTO FROM OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WHO CAN PROVIDE LOW MORE INFORMATION AND WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. INMATES EARN A CONSIDERABLY HIGHER RATE WHEN USING THEIR SKILLS WHILE PERFORMING THE DUTIES AND I W. L. PROJECTS AND MEET BOARD LABOR OR PRISON INDUSTRY AUTHORITY JOBS. IN THE PRESENCE AND MEET SUPPORT SERVICE POSITIONS THE JOBS THAT ARE DONE IN THE INSTITUTION BY THE INMATES. ARE ALLOCATED DIFFERENT PAY RATES PAID RATES. INMATES WITH SKILL SETS FOR PLANT OPERATIONS TO HELP MAINTAIN THE FACILITY CAN ACCEPT A LESS STRENUOUS JOB. FOR THE SAME RATE OF PAY INSIDE THE INSTITUTION IT COULD BE THAT THEY ACCEPT A COOK POSITION OR CLERK POSITION FOR EXAMPLE. BY INCREASING THE PAY FOR PLAN OPS POSITIONS WITHIN THE INSTITUTION FOR INMATES IT WILL ENCOURAGE INMATES TO USE THEIR TRADE SKILLS. WHILE BEING EMPLOYED WITHIN THE INSTITUTION THIS BENEFITS THE INSTITUTION MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS THE INMATE. IN ADDITION WHEN THE INMATE TAKES THOSE JOBS IN THE INSTITUTION FOR PLAN OPS WHEN A POSITION COMES OPEN WITH IWL OR P. I A. THERE ACTIVELY USING THEIR SKILL AND THEY MAKE THE TRANSITION TO THOSE UP POSITIONS THAT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. WHEN INMATES GO TO P. AYE IN IWL THEY DO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS ASIDE FROM PAY INCLUDING CERTIFICATES. CREDIT EARNINGS. SO WE DO INTEND TO SEE INMATES PARTICIPATING IN THOSE PROGRAMS WE DON'T BELIEVE WE WILL DRAW AWAY FROM THOSE PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THOSE ADDED INCENTIVES. WHEN AN ENEMY COMPLETE TONIGHT W. ALL PROJECT THOSE TYPICALLY ARE OR SHORT TERM. THEIR IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS WITHIN AND EIGHT THEY RETURNED BACK TO THE INSTITUTION FOR JOBS IN THE INSTITUTION. OFTEN FOR SIGNIFICANT PAY REDUCTION THIS WOULD CORRECT DOWN IN THOSE IN THOSE AREAS. I ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS THE BEACON SEASONAL SPUR CIVIL SERVICE CLASSIFICATIONS. I READ THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS FROM LA WHEN THAT REGARDS I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE. THE DEPARTMENT IS ACTIVELY ADDRESSING VACANCIES AND PLAN OP CIVIL SERVICE. WE'VE DONE FOCUSED RECRUITMENTS HIRING FAIRS AND A ROBUST SOCIAL MEDIA PUSH. JUST RECENTLY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE DID A ONE DAY RECRUITMENT AND HIRING FAIR FOR SPECIFIC FOR PLAN OPTS POSITIONS AT TO OVER SOUTHERN INSTITUTIONS CHUCKWALLA. AN IRON WOULD. WE'RE NINETY ONE APPLICANTS ATTENDED. WE'RE CONTINUING THOSE EFFORTS WITH DOING ANOTHER LOCATION IN LATE APRIL WITH PLANS FOR ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS INTO THE SUMMER. HAVING VACANCIES ON OUR PLAN OP CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS DOES NOT HINDER THE ABILITY FOR INMATES TO PARTICIPATE AS WORKERS. WE STILL HAVE PLENTY OF PLANT OPERATIONS STAFF TO SUPERVISE THOSE INMATES THAT TAKE THE JOBS. IN ADDITION WHEN WE HAVE VACANCIES ARE PLAN OPS CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS. TYPICALLY WE HAVE A LOT OF OVERTIME TO COMPENSATE FOR THOSE VACANCIES TO KEEP THE FACILITY RUNNING INCLUDING POSITIONS THAT REQUIRE TWENTY FOUR. HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AS IT RELATES TO STATIONARY ENGINEERS WITH OUR WATER WASTEWATER TREATMENT PROGRAMS. WELL THE REGULATIONS DO NOT ALLOW US TO PROVIDE MILESTONES OR REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS FOR SUPPORT SERVICE POSITIONS THE AND MANY JOBS IN THE PRISON. WE DO PROVIDE THEM WITH PAYING AND THE INMATES ALSO CAN PARTICIPATE IN ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS WHEN THEY'RE NOT AT WORK. BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE HOW THAT OF A. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. THIS PROPOSAL ALONG WITH OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL THAT WILL GET TO NEXT. IT'S DESIGNED TO TRAIN IN MADE WORKFORCE THAT NOT ONLY CAN FILL THESE CRITICAL POSITIONS BUT ALSO THEIR EQUIPPED WITH SKILLS THAT ARE EMPLOYABLE CON RELEASED. ON AS THEY PARTICIPATE IN OUR CURRENT TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MILESTONE COMPLETION CREDITS JUST AS A WOULD BE ENOUGH AYE WLUP AYE A TRAINING PROGRAM. AND THEN UPON COMPLETION THEY HAVE IN ME EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS. THE IF THE PROPOSAL NEARLY SIX TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THE SIMILARLY SKILLED POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTION. AND ALSO ALLEVIATE THE HIGH VACANCY RATE OUR PLAN OPERATIONS FACILITY MAINTENANCE POSITIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD ELLIOTT. KILLING ON NEIL LA L.. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST WE THINK IT'S UNCLEAR HOW IT WILL REDUCE VACANCIES AN INMATE FACILITY MAINTENANCE WORKER POSITIONS AND AND. THIS IS FOR TWO REASONS FIRST. AS THE ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED. INMATES NPI AND IWL POSITIONS ALREADY RECEIVE OTHER NON PAY BENEFITS SETS SO DOESN'T APPEAR THAT IT WOULD NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO ATTRACT INMATES AWAY FROM THOSE POSITIONS. SECOND INMATES ENGAGED. IN OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. BESIDES AND IWL. ARE ALREADY THERE SIT GIVEN THAT THERE'S A THIRTY PERCENT VACANCY RATE IN CAL PA POSITIONS WHICH CURRENTLY OFFER THE HIGHER WAGES AND THEN ADDITIONAL NON PAY BENEFITS. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT. INCREASING THE WAGES IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO ATTRACT OTHER INMATES WERE ENGAGED IN. MANY OTHER ACTIVITIES WHILE INCARCERATED INTO. THESE HIGHER PAYING JOBS THAT USED A SIMILAR SKILLSET ADDS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES I'M FOR THE PLANT. MATT MAINTENANCE INMATE WORKERS. HOWEVER IF THE PROPOSAL IS EFFECTIVE IN ATTRACTING INMATES INTO THOSE POSITIONS. IT COULD HAVE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES DEPENDING ON WHERE IT'S ATTRACTING INMATES FROM AND WHAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE DOING WITH THEIR TIME. FOR EXAMPLE A COULD INCREASE CAPITAL OUTLAY COST TO THE EXTENTIT ATTRACTS INMATES AWAY FROM IWL PROJECTS REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO. USE. NON INMATE LABOR AT A HIGHER COST TO COMPLETE ITS CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. IT COULD INCREASE PURCHASING COSTS FOR CDC OUR AND OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS TO THE EXTENT IT. I REDUCES INMATE LABOR AVAILABLE TO P. I A AND IN TURN REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF GOODS PA IS ABLE TO PRODUCE WHICH IN TURN REQUIRES WOULD MEAN THAT THE STATE. WOULD POTENTIALLY BE PURCHASING PRODUCTS AT HIGHER COST FROM OTHER SUPPLIERS. AND TO THE EXTENT IT ATTRACTS INMATES AWAY FROM OTHER USES OF THEIR TIME THAT ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM RELATIVE TO WORKING IN A PLANT OPERATIONS. POSITION IT COULD INCREASE RECIDIVISM. I AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT. IT ATTRACTS INMATES FROM OTHER USES OF THEIR TIME THAT. WOULD RESULT IN THEM EARNING MILESTONE CREDITS IT COULD RESULT IN SOME INMATES SPENDING MORE TIME IN PRISON WHICH IN TURN WOULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE COSTS. AND THEN. FINALLY. THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS INDICATED THAT IT IT ALSO HAS FACE CHALLENGES IN RECRUITING CIVIL SERVICE WORKERS FOR MAINTENANCE. POSITIONS. HOWEVER SO AT THIS POINT IT'S STILL UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THE BACKLOG THAT IS SITE IS THAT THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG THAT CITED AS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM HERE. IS IT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BY THIS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST GIVEN IT'S UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THAT BACKLOG IS DUE TO CIVIL SERVICE VACANCIES OR. INMATE WORKER VACANCIES. SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION AND DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON WHY IT THINKS OPPOSE WAGING INCREASE WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING FACILITY MAINTENANCE AND AND REDUCING FACILITY MAINTENANCE WORKER VACANCIES. IN LIGHT OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE EXPLAINED HERE. HOW IT PLANS TO MITIGATE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROPOSAL THAT I I'M ALLUDED TO INCLUDING INCREASED CAPITAL OUTLAY COSTS READ REDUCE RICK AT INCREASE RECIDIVISM EXCITER? THE NUMBER OF CIVIL SERVICE VACANCY WORKER AT MAINTENANCE WORKER VACANCIES. HOW CDC ARE HAS SPENT THE SAVINGS FROM THOSE VACANCIES AND WHETHER COULD? REDIRECT THOSE SAVINGS TO PAY FOR THIS PROPOSED WAGE INCREASE FOR INMATE WORKERS. AND THEN WHAT STEPS IT IS TAKING TO ADDRESS THOSE. INMATE WORK THAT MAINTENANCE WORKER VACANCIES WHICH AND WHICH THEY HAVE ADDRESSED THAT WILL CONSIDER TAKE BACKING CONSIDER. ON. AND BE BACK IN TOUCH. THE COMMENTS OF YES FINANCE. THE TOUCH ON THOSE POINTS WE DON'T SEE THESE. THESE PLAN OPERATION POSITIONS AS IN COMPETITION WITH PIAA WERE IWL THE SEE THIS. THIS PROPOSAL AS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND THE TRAINING PROGRAMS OFFERED BY PIAA AND IWL TO CREATE A TRAINED WORKFORCE THEY CAN EARN MILESTONE CREDITS WHILE THEY'RE IN TRAINING. AND THEN WHEN THEY GRADUATE UPON COMPLETION THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYMENT IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR INSTITUTIONS. THESE ARE ALSO HIGHLY VALUED SKILLS WITH COMMUNITY UPON RELEASE SO. ALSO. BECAUSE I HAD A I WAS GONNA JUST FOLLOW UP AND SAY THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO YOU KNOW TOUCH ON ANY OTHER SPECIFIC CONCERNS MENTION MY THAT LEO. COMMENTS APPEAR. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE ANYONE IN FAVOR. PRO. IN ONE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL. YES OKAY. THANK YOU A JIM LINDBERGH FROM THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION THAT CALIFORNIA. WE JUST THINK THAT. PAYING PEOPLE FOR THE WORK THEY DO. A. THAT INCREASING THEIR PAY. IS JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO JUST ON ITS ON ITS OWN STANDALONE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY. WITH THAT ITEMS BEING HELD OVER ONE TOLL ONE OTHER COMMENT YES. A GOOD MORNING I MY NAME IS EMILY HARRIS I'M WITH ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO FOLLOW ON. WHAT JIM WAS SAYING? LOOKING AT THE PAYSCALE FOR PEOPLE IN PRISON YOU KNOW FOLKS ARE MAKING VERY LITTLE MONEY. AND WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THAT WERE. RESOURCING FOLKS SO THAT THEY CAN BE PAYING FOR RESTITUTION SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES SAVING FOR WHEN THEY'RE COMING HOME AND SO THINKING ABOUT TIME. HOW FAR YOU KNOW FIFTY THREE CENTS AN HOUR IS COMPARED TO WHAT FOLKS WE MAKING THEM IF THEY WERE EARNING MINIMUM WAGE IT REALLY CONFLICTED STATE TO CONSIDER PAYING PEOPLE MORE ALL THAT WORKING IN PRISON? THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY MOVING THAT ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN OVER. THE GOING TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. WHICH IS CAREER TECH EDUCATION EXPANSION AND EQUIPMENT. FRESH. OKAY WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTS EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE POSITIONS INCLUDING THIRTEEN INSTRUCTORS AND EIGHT CIOS. IN HALF CIOS IN BUDGET YEAR. FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. ALL DESIGNED TO EXPAND OUR CT FACILITIES. TO THIRTEEN NEW SITES AT TEN DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS. THERE IS A COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL THAT DEALS DIRECTLY WITH EQUIPMENT REFRESH THAT YOU MENTIONED. WE DID RECEIVE TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR FOR THIS EQUIPMENT REFRESH THAT WAS AN ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE. THAT AND I DETERMINED THAT THE ONGOING NEED IS ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SO THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE THAT WHOLE. AND I'M JOINED AGAIN BY RIGHT SUSAN WHO IS OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE RP HE'S GONNA PROVIDE YOU A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION THAT WILL ANSWERING QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING AGAIN. AS I MISTER LOPEZ MENTIONED WE BASICALLY. OFFENDERS WITH A MODERATE TO HIGH NEED A FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND LOOKED AT THAT IN THE FIRST SCOPE OF THIS. DISPERSED PART OF THIS BE CP AND REQUESTED ON BASED ON THAT ANALYSIS THIRTEEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ACROSS TEN DIFFERENT SITES. AND ASSOCIATE THE APPROPRIATE CUSTODY. WITH THAT. THE GOAL OF THIS WAS IN PART TO START PUTTING THESE ON. CAREER TECHNICAL EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OFTEN LACKING OR HAVE MINIMAL PROGRAMS ARE READY SO. WE FOCUSED OUR NEED THEIR. NON AND LOOKED AT THE PROGRAM AND TOTAL SO THIS PROPOSAL REALLY ROUNDS OUT DRP. DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE FEEL CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION NEEDS. AT THIS FIVE TIME BASED ON THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE RECEIVING. THE SECONDARY PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THE EQUIPMENT REFRESHED HISTORICALLY THE DIVISION HAS HAD TO INTERNALLY REDIRECT FUNDING TO SUPPORT ON ANY EQUIPMENT REFRESHED NEEDED IN ALL THREE HUNDRED AND. CURRENTLY THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THERE WAS LAST YEAR AS MISTER LOPEZ MENTIONED SOME FUNDING THAT WENT TOWARD THAT REFRESH AND THIS. ROUNDS OUT AGAIN THAT REFRESH COMPONENT ME THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE REQUESTING THIS PROPOSAL AND WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL THIS YEAR IS WE HAVE DONE. A REALLY GOOD JOB FILLING VACANCIES IN OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM I'M AND I THINK THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE BCP AS WELL. BUT THAT ELIMINATES THE SAVINGS WE HAVE IN FUTURE YEARS SO THIS IS AYE AYE YEAR WHERE THIS REQUEST BECOMES VERY CRITICAL FOR US. IN BOTH BEING ABLE TO REFRESH EQUIPMENT. ACROSS THE STATE THAT SO THAT. OFFENDERS ARE GETTING THE CAREER TECHNICAL PROGRAMMING THAT IS. BOTH APPROPRIATE AND RELEVANT AS THEY LEAVE TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY. AND. THAT ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE FILLING OUR VACANCY SO THAT WE'RE NOT IMPACTS ARE HAVING TO HOLD VACANCIES TO REFRESH US. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE BELIAU. WE DID NOT RAISE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. OKAY ECONOMISTS APPEAR. KATIE COMES FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY VERY NICE THAT BRINGS US DOWN TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE. RADIO COMMUNICATIONS RADIO COMMUNICATIONS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THE DEPARTMENT. OUR ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SERVICES OFFICE THAT REQUEST THIRTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS I'M ONE TIME FINDING. IN BUDGET YEAR TO REPLACE THE PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO SYSTEM FOR STRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT AT NINE ADULT INSTITUTIONS TO JUVENILE FACILITIES AND A FIRE CAMPS AND TO ADD INTEROPERABLE WITH THE. TO THE DEPARTMENT'S TRANSPORTATION UNIT. THESE PURCHASES AND UPGRADES WILL ALLOW DEPARTMENT AS IS MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA. TO BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH. TWO WAY COMMUNICATION STANDARDS FOR ALL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. I'M JOINED FOR THIS ISSUE BY DIRECTOR RUSS NICHOLS OF OUR AND PRESENT MISH SYSTEMS DIVISION. IS GOING PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE MORE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ACCORDING DUCT WEBER MEMBERS. THE RADIO SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IS ONE FOUNDATIONAL TOOLS IN OUR OUR PRISONS WITH HIS DAILY ACTIVITIES OF MOVING OFFENDERS TWO DINING HALLS TO EDUCATION PROGRAMS VISITATION. THE COMMUNICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THAT PROCESS. HANDS ON THOSE RADIO SYSTEMS. IN THE EVENT OF ANY SORT OF UNPLANNED EVENT WHETHER THAT'S A A MEDICAL EMERGENCY A FIGHT FIRE ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES IT'S AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT CRITICAL TOOL IN MANAGING THE RESPONSE TO THAT. SITUATION AND TO HAVING SOME SORT TACTICAL CONTROL AND ABILITY TO MANAGE THE INSTITUTION IN GENERAL. THE SITES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RADIO SYSTEMS AT THE NINE PRISONS. IN PARTICULAR. AND THE JUVENILES SITES IN THE TRANSPORTATION UNITS MOST OF THOSE WERE INSTALLED WHEN THE. EXCUSE ME WHEN THE FACILITY WAS CONSTRUCTED THEY'RE APPROACHING THIRTY YEARS OLD NORMAL LIFESPAN ON ONE OF THOSE RADIO SYSTEMS ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IS ABOUT TEN YEARS. SO THEY ARE WELL BEYOND A USEFUL LIFE CYCLE. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT THAT THE PARTS TO REPAIR THE SYSTEMS TO MAINTAIN THEM. ARE VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT IN FACT LAST YEAR IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS WE HAD TO CATASTROPHIC. SYSTEM FAILURES. AND IN BOTH INSTANCES WE WERE LITERALLY WORKING WITH A VENDOR WORKING WITH. PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO SCRAPE TOGETHER PARTS CANNIBALIZED THEM FROM OTHER SYSTEMS TO GET THE THE SYSTEMS REPAIRED. AT ONE POINT WE WERE LITERALLY LOOKING AT EBAY TO SEE IF WE COULD FIND PARTS FOR A CRITICAL PIECE OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THE INSTITUTIONS. WHEN THE SYSTEMS FAIL. AND INSTITUTIONS PUT IN A POSITION OF MODIFIED PROGRAMMER LOCKDOWN WHICH MEANS THE OFFENDERS DON'T GET VISITATION THEY DON'T GET PROGRAMS. IT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS ALL OF THE PROCESSES AT A PRISON THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC SAFETY AND STAFF AN OFFENDER SAFETY ISSUE. AND AND IN GENERAL JUST INHIBITS EVERYTHING OR TRYING TO TO. DO WITHIN THE INSTITUTION. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT. THE COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. BELIAU. OKAY I DON'T THINK WE ANY COMMENTS APPEAR. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE ON ITEM NUMBER NINE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS. SEEMS FAIRLY CLEAR FAIRLY SIMPLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT BRINGS US MASS ITEM TEN AND ELEVEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THOSE TWO ITEMS AND THEN WE WILL. HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS IF ANYONE HAS ANY AYE AYE COMMENTS ON THOSE ONE IS THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE THE ACADEMY. I THINK WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATION ALREADY ABOUT THAT WILL GIVE THEM REPORT YES. OKAY. ISSUE NUMBER TEN INVOLVES THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE ACADEMY PROPOSAL. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE. TO RUN. ONE ACADEMY OF YOUTH CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS AND YOUTH CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS INSISTING OF FORTY CADETS TOTAL. I'M JOINED BY STACY LOPEZ WHO IS OUR ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF OUR PEACE OFFICER SELECTION EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT. WHICH OVERSEES THE ACADEMY AND TO ADD TO HER LEFT I AM ALSO JOINED BY DIRECTOR CHUCK SUPPLE WHO IS OUR DIRECTOR DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. I WANNA START WITH MISS LOPEZ AND THAT THEY WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING OTHER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGAIN I'M STACY LOCUS I'M THIS ISSUE DIRECTOR FOR THE PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT. WITH OVERSIGHT OF THE BASIC CORRECTIONAL JUVENILE ACADEMY WE'VE BEEN RUNNING ACADEMIES FOR THE JUVENILE. A JUSTICE FOR THE LAST. THREE YEARS I WERE REQUESTING TO EXTEND OUR FUNDING FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO RUN FORTY CADETS THROUGH NEXT NEXT BUDGET YEAR AND THEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR FORTY CADETS SO TOTAL OF EIGHTY OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THIS IS A SMALL KEEP UP WITH OUR ATTRITION AND. ALLOW STAFF WHO ARE RETIRING OR SEPARATING WILL BE ABLE TO REPLACE THEM WITHOUT HAVING VACANCIES WITHIN THE JUVENILE TO CATCH UP JUVENILE FACILITIES. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE OKAY ECONOMISTS WHO FINANCE. BELIAU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JR SORT OF WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SUITE IN RAISING CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. OKAY. SO WE HAVE WE HAVE ALREADY OVER THOUSAND STAFF MEMBERS AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED. OF PROCESS SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS OR YOUNG PEOPLE AND AND YOU WILL JUSTICE. AND WE NEED TO RUN ANOTHER ACADEMY TO GET FORTY MORE PEOPLE. WELL IT I MEAN WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR THAT I MEAN WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS THE ACADEMY. LIZZY PARA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. JUST TO CLARIFY WE DO HAVE THAT MANY STAFF BEING. AUTHORIZED IN THIS BUDGET AND THIS PROPOSAL IS LOOKING TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS WITH PEOPLE SO. WE'RE NOT REQUESTING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IN THIS PROPOSAL WERE SIMPLY REQUESTING FUNDING TO RUN CADETS THROUGH THE ACADEMY AND THEN FILL THE VACANCIES THAT WE HAVE. THE FORTY POSITION NEED IS A CONSISTENT WITH THE METHODOLOGY WE'VE USED ON THE ADULT SIDE FOR YEARS NOW. WE DO OOK AT VACANCIES AT A POINT IN TIME WE LOOK AT PROJECTED GRADUATES FOR THOSE ACADEMIES THAT ARE SCHEDULED FREE NOW IN JULY AND THIS CASE. AND WE ALSO LOOK AT THE AVERAGE ATTRITION NUMBERS OVER TYPICALLY AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE WAY IT DEPARTURES. ANY COMMENT FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL TAKE THE NEXT. THE LAST ITEM WHICH IS THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORM JUNE JUSTICE REFORM. OKAY. ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN OKAY. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT REQUEST THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE POINT SIX POSITIONS IN BUDGET YEAR. GROWING TO SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND FIFTY ONE POSITIONS IN NINETEEN TWENTY. AND THEN SETTLING AT NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND SIXTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT POSITIONS ONGOING STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WITH THESE RESOURCES AT THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES TO RAISE THE AGE OF JURISDICTION PRETTY JJ FROM TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY FIVE. AND WE ALSO PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH A PILOT YOUTH ADULT PROGRAM. WHERE BY SEVENTY SIX YOUTH OFFENDERS WILL BE HOUSED AT THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE WHERE THEY? OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN HOUSE WITHIN OUR ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND WE TALKED ALL BUT ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING WITH THE SECRETARY. I'M JOINED FOR THIS ISSUE I'M BY DIRECTOR CHECK SUPPLE FROM OUR DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. DIRECTOR SELLS GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON THE PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. MUCH BETTER CHAIRMAN AND. FULL COMMITTEE MEMBERS LITTLE BUT A CONTEXT WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSAL. TAKING A LOOK AT THE. OF ALL VAIN RESEARCH WITH REGARD TWO ADOLESCENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND RECOGNIZING THAT. YOUNG ADULTS BRAIN IS NOT YOU KNOW REALLY FULLY DEVELOP THINGS SPECIFICALLY THAT AREA THAT. ARE THOSE ADULT FUNCTIONS IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX UNTIL. AROUND THE AGE TWENTY FIVE. TOOK A LOOK AT. THE AGED JURISDICTION. WITH REGARD TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT HE YOUTH. CAN STAY IN DJJ AND AFTER HEARING SOME CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO THE TRANSFER PROCESS. IN THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN RELATED HEARINGS THAT THE AGE OF JURISDICTION AS CURRENTLY SET AT TWENTY THREE. DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME FOR. OLDER YOUNG ADULTS SO TO SPEAK COMING INTO THE TRANSFER HEARINGS TO BE ABLE TO MEET THAT FACTOR WITH REGARD TO. TIME TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM REHABILITATION IF THEY'RE AMENABLE TO IT. AND THAT IF WE WERE TO RAISE THE AGE OF JURISDICTION BACK TO THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. THAT WE WOULD SEE A GREATER NUMBER OF YOUNG ADULTS ADJUDICATED TO DJJ RATHER THAN CONVICTED. AS ADULTS AND HAVING TO GO TO ADULT PRISON. AND CONTINUING WITH THAT LINE OF REASONING IN THAT. THERE ARE A FEW THE CURRENT PRACTICES IS THAT YOUNG ADULTS WHO DO END UP CONVICTED. AS ADULTS USE JUVENILES CONVICTED AS ADULTS. COME TO DJJ AND IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR TERM. ADULT TERM PRIOR TO THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WE'RE REQUIRED BY LAW TO TRANSFER THEM OVER TO THE ADULT SIDE TO COMPLETE THEIR TERM. AND WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO KEEP YEARS WHO ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR TERM. PRIOR TO TURNING TO THE EIGHT TO TWENTY FIVE. DEPENDENT UPON THE JURORS GOING BACK TO TWENTY FIVE. IF THEY'RE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR ADULT TERM PRIOR TO TURNING THE TWENTY FIVE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO STAY. IN DJJ AND BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM AND RATHER THAN GOING OVER TO THE ADULT SIDE. THEN FINALLY CONTINUE WITHOUT LINE OF REASONING THE THOUGHT WAS THAT PERHAPS THERE'S A POPULATION OF YOUNG ADULTS WHO WERE CONVICTED BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE. WHO ALSO COULD COMPLETE THEIR TERM PRIOR TO TURNING THE AGED TWENTY FIVE WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM COMING TO DJ J. RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO? ADULT PRISON. AND THOSE ARE THE THREE PROPOSAL SO TO SPEAK FOR AYE IN THE RATIONALE BEHIND THEM. VETERAN KATE CONTAINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ANYONE FROM FINANCE. THOMAS BELIAU. DID YOU START WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ON OVERALL WE FIND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED CHANGES PROMISING HOWEVER AS I WILL DISCUSS IN GREATER DETAIL WE DO RECOMMEND MODIFYING THEM TO ADDRESS SOME. POTENTIALLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES APPROVING THAT CHANGES ON ONLY A LIMITED TERM BASIS. AND DIRECTING DE GJ TO CONDUCT SOME SPECIFIC EVALUATIONS. FIRST WE FIND THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO INCREASE DE JJ'S AGE OF JURISDICTION TO. TWENTY FIVE PROMISING AS IT WOULD LIKELY REDUCE THE NUMBER ADULT COURT THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN JUDGES ARE CONDUCTING TRANSFER HEARINGS ONE OF THE THINGS THEY CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TRANSFER YOUTH IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME DJJ HAS TO REHABILITATE THESE YOU. ARM IN ADDITION RESEARCH DOES SHOW THAT YOUTHS WHO REMAIN IN JUVENILE COURT RATHER THAN BEING TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT GENERALLY HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES. MOREOVER DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT ROUGHLY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER YEAR DJJ IS QUITE A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE ADULT SIDE WHICH COSTS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND PER INMATE PER YEAR HOUSED IN A CONTRACT BAD. JUVENILE COURT TERMS ARE ACTUALLY SHORT ENOUGH THAT IN CERTAIN CASES THEY CAN BE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN COMMITTING AN ADULT TO A LONGER A DART. COMMITTING A YOU TO A LONGER ADULT SENTENCE. FOR EXAMPLE JUVENILE COURT USE RELEASE FROM DJJ IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SPEND AN AVERAGE OF AROUND THREE YEARS IN DJJ. WHILE ADULT COURT USE WHO'D BEEN SENT DIRECTLY TO THE STATE PRISON SPACE SYSTEM SPEND ABOUT NINE YEARS IN PRISON. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT SOME YOUTH WHO ARE CURRENTLY RELEASED AT TWENTY THREE NOW WOULD END UP STAYING OUT FOR AS MUCH AS TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS. WE VIEW THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SIMPLY% KEEPING YOUTH AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN AVERAGE. DOESN'T INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS. BUT WE FIND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S TO PROPOSALS TO ALLOW ADULT COURT USED TO STAY IN BJJ UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE TO BE PROMISING. AS RESEARCH DONE IN CALIFORNIA DID SH SUGGESTS THAT YOUTH WHO ARE KEPT IN DJJ RATHER THAN SENT TO ADULT PRISON SHE ARM HAD BETTER OUTCOMES. HOWEVER BECAUSE DJJ AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IS QUITE A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS IS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF REHABILITATING THESE YOU. AREN'T WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE'S A LACK OF EVALUATION OF HOW EFFECTIVE DO YOU JJ'S PROGRAMS ARE. FOR EXAMPLE WELL DJJ GENERALLY DOES BASE ITS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ON MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE ELSEWHERE. ARM IT IS NOT CURRENTLY ASSESSING ITS PROGRAMS WITH TOOLS KNOWN AS FIDELITY ASSESSMENTS TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICES AS THEY ROLL THOSE PROGRAMS OUT THOUGH THEY WILL BEGIN DOING SO NEXT YEAR. IN ADDITION DJJ IS NOT PLANNING ON RELEASING AN OVERALL EVALUATION OF THE A ACTUAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS PROGRAMS UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. FINALLY DESPITE OPERA POSING THE YOUNG ADULT OFFENDER PROGRAM AS A PILOT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSING AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM'S COST EFFECTIVENESS. AND IS PROPOSING ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM THESE FACTORS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS WHETHER DJJ WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY REHABILITATE THE YOUTH. THAT THEY WOULD BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR AS A RESULT THE PROPOSAL. OUGHT TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS WE HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST WE RECOMMEND ONLY APPROVING THESE POLICY CHANGES FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME SUCH AS SEVEN YEARS AS THIS WOULD ALLOW THESE CHANGES TO GOING TO A FACT. AND PROVIDE TIME FOR ABOUT YOU ASIAN. SECOND WE RECOMMEND THAT DJJ REQUIRE EXCUSE ME THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED DJJ TO CONTRACT FOR AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THE YOUNG ADULT OFFENDER PROGRAM. AND DIRECT THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JANUARY TEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE NOTE THAT THIS COULD POSSIBLY COST AROUND A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THE LEGISLATURE'S WAITING FOR THE OUTCOME OF THIS VALUATION WE'D RECOMMEND DIRECTING DJJ TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE OUTCOME OF ITS FIDELITY ASSESSMENTS IN ITS OVERALL PROGRAM EVALUATION. FINALLY WE RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE PROPOSED CHANGE TO DO JJ'S AGE OF JURISDICTION. BECAUSE IT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT SOME YOUTH AS I MENTIONED EARLIER SPECIFICALLY WE'D RECOMMEND PROVIDING JUVENILE COURT JUDGES WITH THE. FLEXIBILITY WHEN THEY'RE CONDUCTING OUR TRANSFER HEARINGS TO. ALLOW YOU TO STAY IN BJJ UPS THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE JUDGE DETERMINES THAT NOT DOING SO WOULD NECESSITATE TRANSFERRING THE YOUTH TO ADULT COURT. WE THINK THAT THIS WOULD PREVENT THESE YOUTH FROM GOING TO ADULT COURT WITHOUT UNNECESSARILY AFFECTING YOU THROUGH OUR RD IN DJJ. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANY. MANY QUESTIONS APPEAR YES. I THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT DIRECTOR YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE A LITTLE BIT AND. I THINK IT'S. DEATHLY GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THERE WAS GOING TO BE IN THE DETAILS OF OF HOW THIS WORKS. AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE NOT. TAKING OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THESE YOUTH LONGER THAN NECESSARY WAR. INTERFERING WITH THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO GO BACK TO THEIR COUNTIES WHICH IS WHERE. THEY ARE CLOSE TO THEIR FAMILY FRIENDS AND AND. THE STRUCTURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED WHEN THEY COME OUT. THE THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS IS THE COST AND I THINK THAT THIS PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY FILLED OUT AND LOOK AT THE PROGRAMMING THAT DJJ HAS BEEN DOING. BECAUSE IF THE COST IS HIGHER KEEPING THEM IN DJJ RATHER THAN GOING TO THE DOE PRESIDENT THE REASON FOR THAT. IS THE PROGRAMMING REHABILITATION. THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE RATE OF RECIDIVISM THAN I'VE. SPEAKING FOR MYSELF NOW THE SO THE COMMITTEE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT THAT WE COULD BE MAKING IN THOSE YOU. SO LOOKING AT THE. THE DETAILS OF OF HOW THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE MAIN POINT WHICH I KNOW IS THE MAIN POINT IS NOT. SENDING YOU THOUGHT NECESSARILY TO ADULT PRISONS WHERE THE OUTCOMES ARE DRAMATICALLY NEGATIVE THAT REALLY. LOOKING TO THE SUCCESS OF THE KIDS AND AND WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THEIR BEST ATTRIBUTES SO GETTING REPORTS BACK. VERY OUT HOW WE CAN BETTER ANALYZE THIS PROGRAM THINK SHOW SOME LIGHT IN. ON WHAT'S WHAT'S BEING EFFECTIVE OR NOT EFFECTIVE ONE THING I WOULD ASK DOES AND THIS IS. IT'S HIGH REALLY SELFISH THAT WE GET SOME REPORTS BACK PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. OTHER ALONG THE LINE SO THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE IT LOOK AT IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM BUT THAT WE'RE STILL HERE. WHEN WE START TO GET SO REPORTS BACK SO WE CAN WORK WITH DJJ ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PROGRAM IS AS IT GETS IMPLEMENTED. BUT. I THINK THE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE ARE THE. PROPER PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR TRULY FOR THE BENEFITS OF OF THOSE KIDS PROGRAMMING RECIDIVISM REDUCTION AND GETTING THEM BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE LIKE I KNOW THAT'S PART OF YOUR GOALS AS WELL. AND SO I I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PROPOSAL BUT WE JUST NEED TO WORK OUT A LITTLE BIT THE DETAILS AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE GETTING REPORTS BACK. TO THE LEGISLATURE IN A TIMELY WAY. TO BE ABLE TO ANALYZE THIS AND AND HELP. TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE IN. AND SO WITH THE RESULTS THAT WE NEED. THANK YOU BUT I I AGREE THAT. YOU KNOW. THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY HAVING US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF WOULDN'T THIS IS MENTIONED AS A PILOT PROGRAM. OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN IN DAY. MOST PILOTS DO. WE WE DID WANT TO KNOW THAT. WE DO UNDERSTAND THE. THE RECOMMENDATION BY THE ILIO TO HAVE LIMITED TERM FUNDING HOWEVER. YEAH AT THAT ADDING A SUNSET DATE DOES PROVIDE SOME OPERATIONAL ISSUES FOR THE DEPARTMENT SUCH AS HIRING FOR THE POSITIONS AND WE DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE BUDGET IS. YOU KNOW AVAILABLE TO BE REVISITED AND REVIEWED IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS IF THE CHANGES NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE. WE DO MENTION PILOT IN THE. PROPOSAL I'M IN THE. PLAN TO REVIEW THIS POPULATION WHILE GOING THROUGH THE PROGRAM TO SEE HOW BENEFICIAL IT IS TO SEE IF IT CAN BE APPLIED TO FUTURE POPULATIONS. I'M KIND OF A STICKLER ABOUT PILOTS THE AND LIKE TO BELIEVE THEY REALLY ARE PILOTS AT THIS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE. WE LEARN FROM IT BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF IT IF IT'S NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF WHERE SOME XIN IS THAT THESE THINGS WORK. AND SOMETIMES THEY DO BUT. HAVING BEEN AROUND. BUREAUCRACIES FOR A LONG ENOUGH TIMETO KNOW THAT. YOU COULD UNDO YOU COULDN'T BASICALLY UNDO THE GOOD THAT YOU ANTICIPATE TO DO AN AUDIT OF OTHERS THAT IT THERE SO FOR INSTANCE IT SUPPOSEDLY IT'S NOT GOING TO. IT'S GOING TO MAKE MORE KIDS MAKES IT NOT TRIED AS ADULTS BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY HAVE MORE PEOPLE BEING TRIED AS ADULTS AND WANTED TO AVOID THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. BECAUSE THEY FIGURE THAT MAY BE AN EASIER SYSTEM ON FOLKS THAT THEY WANNA KEEP LONGER. AND SO WE MAY FIND OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MORE KIDS BEING TRIED IN THE ADULT COURT. IN THE JUVENILE COURT IF THAT HAPPENS THEN HOW DO WE ASSESS AT HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THIS. IF IT HAS THE NEGATIVE AFFECT IN AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. BUT I KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEM OFTEN CALCULATE IN THEIR OWN MIND WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO SEE IN RESULT. AND AS A RESULT CAN BASICALLY UNDO THE PROCESS BY HAVING MORE BY KIDS TRIED IN THE ADULT SYSTEM VERSES IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM IF THEY FIGURE THERE'S GONNA BE AN EASY WAY OUT. AND US I WOULD HATE THAT TO HAPPEN TALL IN TERMS OF OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND OTHERS IN TERMS OF MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. THAT OFTEN HAPPENS TO CERTAIN KIDS AND SO WE MAY DISCOVER THAT WE BASICALLY UNDONE ALL THE GOOD THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO. IN THAT HAPPENED SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE SO SO I THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO. BUILD IN SOME OF THOSE SAFEGUARDS AND SOME OF THOSE OFF RAMPS IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS OF SO THAT WE'RE NOT LOCKED IN AND THEN THAT'S DISCOVER OURSELVES. OF FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD WITH MAYBE FEW PEOPLE IN IN THE JUNE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MORE OF THEM IN THE ADULT SYSTEM A BECAUSE OF WHAT FOLKS WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH AND FELT WE WERE. TRYING TO BE EASY ON CRIME HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO. I THINK A PILOT IS IS IMPORTANT AND AND SOME ASSESSMENTS ALONG THE WAY AS MY COLLEAGUES TALKS ABOUT. A HAVING. MORE ASSESSMENT MAKE SURE THAT WE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THINK IF WE PROBABLY HAD DONE MORE ASSESSMENTS IN THIS LAST THIRTY YEARS OF INCARCERATION WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE STOPPED SOMEONE A MADNESS THAT WE SAW. A TAKING PLACE AS WE OUT WENT FROM WHAT TWENTY FIVE MONTHS DID NOT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TWENTY NINE YEARS WHATEVER THE PEOPLE BEING IMPRISONED WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE. STOPPED SOME OF THE CRAZINESS THAT WE DID END UP REASSESSED THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYONE. INTENDED TO INCREASE THAT NUMBER VIEWS PEOPLE SPEND IN PRISON APE THEY INTENDED TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFER. ANDA AND OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T LET ME DESCRIBE THAT MUSCLE IN MAKE THE WORLD SAFER BUT WE JUST MADE A PRISON SYSTEM LARGER. YET IF I MAY REALLY QUICK AMATEUR NORTH PART IN A FINANCE. I DO YOU JUST WANT TO REITERATE OUR POINT THAT THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY JUST TO ENCOURAGE JUVENILE COURTS. TO. TRY THESE JUVENILES AS IN THE JUVENILE COURT NOT SET HIM TO THE DOOR QUIRK. AND ALSO I WE DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE RAISING THE AGE JURISDICTION TO TWENTY FIVE DOES POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR LINK LONGER LENGTHS OF STAY. THAT WAS NEVER OUR INTENT. AND IN FACT OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD AT DJJ. ONLY ABOUT ONE POINT NINE PERCENT OF RELEASES ACTUALLY STAYED UNTIL THEIR MAXIMUM YOU KNOW CONFINEMENT TIME OF TWENTY THREE SOARED TALKING EIGHT PEOPLE OUT OF. FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR I THINK THAT WERE RELEASED OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD SO I JUST WANNA POINT OUT THEIR X. AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASINGLY SO STAY. AGAIN NEVER OUR INTENT AND WORK WITH THE WORK THAT THE BOARD A JUVENILE HEARINGS HAS BEEN DOING AND FOCUSING ON RELEASING JUVENILES WHEN THEY'RE READY NOT WHEN THEY'RE MAKSIM CONTENT CONFINEMENT TIME IS THERE. YOU'LL THINK THIS PRACTICE WILL BE CHANGING ANYTIME SOON. SO. WE CONTINUE TO SEE SAM OUR PROPOSAL OF RAISING IT NOT THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL I THINK ALL OF US AGREE THAT THAT IT'S A IT'S A GOOD INTENT. AND WE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY SITTING AT THESE TABLES HAVE AS THEIR THEIR INTENT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE COSTLY MONITORING IT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE WHEN IT WHEN IT WHEN IT GOES LIVE AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THE INTENT AND HOPEFULLY WILL ACCOMPLISHING THAT AND. AND AS A SAID MAKING SOME ASSESSMENTS ALONG THE WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS STILL ACCOMPLISHING. BECAUSE. WE WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF TO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF SOME GOOD WORK THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING THAT'S THAT'S ONLY POSITION. POINT UP IS ARE THE INCOMES FROM THE AUDIENCE. IT WILL HAVE. TO COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE CONCERNING THIS PROPOSAL. FROM. I WAS MORE THAN TO SERVE OUT THAT OKAY FOLKS LOOK AND SLOWLY. YES YOU HAVE A MINUTE EACH OKAY. GOOD MORNING WEARING WASHBURN WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND DG DAYS BUDGET AND POPULATION. UMP DE JJ'S OUTDATED PRISON LIKE APPROACH IS FUNDAMENTALLY ILL SUITED TO REHABILITATION TREATMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND WE'RE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED IS THAT ADMITTED HISTORIC DECLINES IN YOUTH CRIMEAND IN THE POPULATION OF DJJ WE'RE SEEING POSTAL TO INCREASE AND EXPAND DJJ. WE'RE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT THE YOUNG ADULT PILOT WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD. TRANSFERRED TO ADULT CRIMINAL COURT. AND. INCREASED LENGTH OF STAY BY INCREASING EACH OF COMPLY THINK THANK YOU. HI I'M LUCY SALZEDO CARTER WITH THE USE LAW CENTER. WE BELIEVE IT'S PREMATURE TO FUND THE YOUNG ADULT PROGRAM INTEL RESEARCH IS DONE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE YOUNG ADULTS NEEDS ACTUALLY ARE WHAT ARE THEIR STRENGTHS WHAT OTHER STRUGGLES. WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMMING NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS? AND AS ADVOCATES WE SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT ARE RESEARCH BASED. AND DATA DRIVEN. AND WE SUPPORT SPECIAL PROGRAMMING FOR YOUNG ADULTS WE TO KNOW ABOUT THE RESEARCH AND AND USE THAT AS A BASIS FOR WHAT WE SUPPORT. BUT WE DON'T REALLY FEEL THAT THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH RESEARCH DONE ON THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION. AND HOW THEY CAN BEST BE SERVED AND HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DJJ BEING THE PAST PROGRAM TO SERVE THEIR NEEDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ON GOOD MORNING DOCTOR WEBER AND. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GEORGE VIA. I AM ORIGINALLY FROM THE SALINAS. MY PROGRAM ASSISTANT FOR A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED MOTIVATED INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP FOR PUBLIC ADVANCEMENT. HOMES WERE SEVENTY PERCENT COMPRISES OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED. THE CIVIC CLEANED IT DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. I'M CURRENTLY A UC DAVIS STUDENT. BUT BEFORE THAT AYE SPENDING ACCUMULATION OF SEVENTY EIGHT YEARS IN AND OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND IT WAS. MANY FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS AND AND NON VIOLENT OFFENSES SUCH AS. THEY OWN. POSITIVE TESTS OF MARIJUANA BUT. WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMINISTRATION HERE I FEEL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE HOW DOESN'T HAVE A SUCCESS RATE. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR APARTMENT OF VARIABILITY ATION THAT THERE'S AYE SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT USED TO BE A RE ARRESTED. FIFTY FOUR PERCENT RE CONVICTED AND THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT GO BACK. STATE CUSTODY AS SOME YA MENTION THAT INSTITUTION IS FAR FROM HOME AND AND. AND OR THE YOUTH THAT ARE. INCARCERATED MOSTLY COME FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO PAY FOR THE RESTITUTION AFTER GOING WITH. SO. I ALSO HAVE A REPORTER FROM A DOCTOR A PSYCHOLOGIST THAT YOU KNOW TESTING ME FOR SEVERE PTSD HYPER VIGILANT CORAZON I STILL SUFFER FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION. ADDED IT'S BECAUSE I FEEL THAT THE INSTITUTION IT'S IT'S SIMILAR TO PRESENT IT. STAFF AT TIMES ARE NOT CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF ALL OF US. AND. ONE STAFF AYE ONE HIGHLIGHT IT WHICH I KNOW HE STILL THERE IS NAME IS. A MARTY GIANNINI WHO HE TREATED US. LIKE WE MATTER MORE THAN TO BUILDING THAT HE WORKED WITH AND THE CHECK HE RECEIVED EVERY DAY AND HE WOULD WORK THIS OUT ALL DAY HERE HELPLESS OUTSIDE ALL DAY. AND WE WOULD COME BACK IT WOULD BE RESTED IT WOULD BE TIRED WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO BED OR WE ARE OUR ENERGY WOULD BE LOW SO THERE WOULDN'T BE.AND I ALSO FEEL THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF A LEADERSHIP AND I'M AN ADULT. IN IN THESE INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE OF YOU YOU PUT ARE A USEFUL. IN A ROOM FULL OF TRAUMA WILL OF COURSE ARE GOING TO BE SKINNER BREED NEGLECT IS GOING TO BRING VIOLENCE IS GOING TO BRING. VERBAL ABUSE. AND I ALSO AGREE WITH SOME SOME FOLKS HERE IT'S WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THAT YOU KNOW I CAME I COME FROM. YOU KNOW. NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WE FOCUS ON HILL IN OUR BODY AND AND DE MASCULINE ARE MACHO ISM AND BEING GENTLE WITH EACH OTHER I THINK THAT SOME OF VERY QUICK THAT'S MISSING YES MA'AM AND AND. I ALSO FEEL THERE SHOULD BE MORE FOLKS LIKE ME WHO HAVE BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT ARE DOING A GOOD NOW ON OUR HEALING OURSELVES TO GIVING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU HOT JIM WHEN BURKE ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION THE CALIFORNIA. WERE VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. BECAUSE ALL OF THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS FACT COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. KEEPING YOUNGER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. WHERE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO? COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AND FAMILY SUPPORTS. IT'S VITAL TO THEIR SUCCESSFUL RE INTEGRATION INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND A LOT OF GOOD WORK HAS TAKEN PLACE IN RECENT YEARS TO TRY AND KEEP. YOUNGER PEOPLE. IN THE COMMUNITY AND. THERE ARE ALREADY STRUCTURAL INCENTIVES. IN THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM TO TRANSFER PEOPLE. TO THE STATE SYSTEM AND. WE WERE VERY. ENAMORED. WITH PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND AND THE DECISION TO REQUIRE JUDGES TO WEIGH IN ON THAT. WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT. JUDGES NOW UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WILL FIND IT. EASIER. TO SEND. YOUNG PEOPLE. INTO THE STATE SYSTEM WHEN ALL OF THE EVIDENCE SAYS THAT PAGE. SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COMMUNITY SO WERE OPPOSED TO THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS EMILY HARRIS OF THE ELLA BAKER CENTER AND. I ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME AND I ALSO JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT THE OPTIONS. YOU KNOW THIS THAT COSTLY NESS OF INCARCERATING YOUNG PEOPLE IN DJJ THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PER INDIVIDUAL JUST IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD BE DOING WITH THAT. AND IN PARTICULAR CONCERNS BY DJJ HOW FAR AWAY THE FACILITIES ARE FROM PEOPLE'S HOMES KEEPING PEOPLE CLOSER TO HOME AND AND AS MY COLLEAGUE JIM HAD MENTIONED THE CONCERN OF SENDING MORE YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH THE ADULT SYSTEM EVEN IF IT IS THROUGH. THE STATE. THROUGH STATE AT DJJ WIND KEEP PEOPLE LOCAL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT I WANT TO THANK THE AUDIENCE FOR THEIR COMMENTS. AND WILL GET. WILL LOOK AT THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE RAISED ABOUT THE PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE CLOSELY. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THOUGH THAT OF THE. THAT THEY AND I WAS LOOKING FOR THE NUMBERS THAT I'M MISSING I CAN'T PUT MY HAND OUT OF THAT THE. JUVENILE POPULATION HAS HAS DECREASED IMMENSELY. AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN AND TERMS OF PUTTING FOLKS BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND EDU ABOUT SIX HUNDRED NOW OF THE FOLKS IN WHERE THERE WERE. WHAT THREE FOUR THOUSAND BEFORE OR SOMETHING? HOW MANY? ELEVEN THOUSAND AT SOME POINT SO THAT MOST OF THE GET MOST OF THE LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS ARE ARE AT THE IN THE LOCAL AREAS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THESE OF THE MORE. SERIOUS OFFENDERS MY UNDERSTANDING AND SO WILL LOOK AT THAT MORE CLOSELY BECAUSE I I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE. BY THE PUBLIC OF WITH REGARDS TO HAVING KIDS CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. HAD MAY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE IN THE IN THE AND BASICALLY PUTTING FOLKS BACK INTO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUT WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT IS IMPORTANT. OF THAT'S THERE CONCLUDES OUR MEETING TODAY I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING. OF. PRETTY PRECISE INCONSISTENT BANK VIA A PUBLIC FOR ATTENDING. AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ALL AT THE NEXT MEETING OF THIS MEETINGS DURING ALL THESE ITEMS WILL BE HELD OVER.
