could everyone please come to the front so to look at least look like you're like me you come always affront I promise you I will buy I took a shower this morning you get closer feeling good up of new I'm a tell the principal so good morning are we do better in that I know is a vacation day for some for all good morning I want to welcome everyone here today -- as you probably can tell I am a morning person -- like to welcome every when here today for ending to school to prison pipeline I'm the chair of that committee -- I'm here because I am a a proud alumnus and graduate of LAUSD I am a Roman so I don't study and -- really I'm also the chair of public safety and like that would help people I been the more prisons ever wanted to in my entire life and I when I first got elected in two thousand twelve every private prison because that that time we had we're in mass incarceration we had incarcerated more people in California did any other state and in most cases any other country -- I asked the private prisons why they were my office and they said that they needed ten thousand more prison beds over the next how we're able to come up with that number and how accurate was and they said they were actors she was about ninety nine to a hundred percent accuracy that they would need ten thousand more prison beds and I say well what was your algorithm what was your would you use no I I'm expecting some for the teachers in here I'm expecting some out long and drawn out algebraic kind of a -- example and he basically said to me we can we know by the number third graders they can't read at third grade how many more prison beds we will need SB in from south LA and your in my district -- represents south LA of I said why don't we educate those individuals so we can determine how many more universities and colleges we need to build in clap with that but the next thing you should really clap about is since two thousand twelve none of those private prisons have ever come back to my office again to talk to me about anything so it is said to me that maybe the solution it's close enough the pipeline we spent a lot of money a rehabilitation which you still we still should do making sure people get out and it become function many members of society but also woke me up to the fact that -- if we cut off that pipeline and squeeze it till it's just impossible for any of our young people to go through the whole system in the whole world would change and so speaker the legislature -- I want to welcome everyone to this this is the second hearing of the select committee on ending the school to prison pipeline in our first hearing we heard from educators DCS using various organizations discussing the crucial role of teachers the teachers play in ending the cycle of and promote the education not incarceration my colleagues and I and I have spent years about the issues are communities face we heard about the need for teachers that understand the trauma I mean the trauma our students experience the need for more school based health services and that's why we're here today addressing trauma through supportive services and programs and wraparound services on campus this have been a frequent topic of conversation the route this legislative year how can we expect our students to learn to succeed in the classroom if we're not providing the services they need and to create an environment where they feel they can access this help this is why fought with fifty million dollars in the state budget over the last years the fund the youth diversion programs this system we have now takes our children from classroom to prison it's really time to in that they will be looking at what current program through providing for students and their families as well as what are additional steps we can take to help them overcome the barriers to their success I know how important is the issue is and what and which is why I this year I worked on AB two five eight a bill to establish a grant program that button student support services and their integration within the surrounding community we look we must look at our children as at promise right now we call our children at risk which kind of focuses on maybe one mistake for two mistakes that they've done they carry that label with them throughout their school academic year sometimes when a in a criminal justice system I have a bill on the governor's desk right now to get rid of that term of at risk take it out education code and take it out of the penal code and call our young people who have challenges call them at promise miss of the future they're not gangsters they're not criminal their young people young people get from doctors lawyers engineers could be anything we should celebrate the promise of what they will be and not just well on what they may have done with that I want to introduce one of our esteemed guests on the first team guesses here okay I will do sports betting superintended of school I go too fast so what I will right could do is bring up the first panel and when he gets here just kind of like we do in the assembly just stop bring our special guest unless

privilege serving the south central community I am to a proud product of valley unified once the pilot always the pilot hole of any is banning hospital and my two children are also products of LA unified they are nor bond cal chose so proud around very honored to be here get all that a lesbian but me that's good asked yes Bob it is a little knows the meet the audios enough money that I mean nobody is blank of CSU in the soil or will you also I meant the Soviet Exora and estar√° got on community that they Fremont high school so thank you once more I do see that we do have our superintendent Mister Austin Butte near here I want to officially welcome him two beautiful Fremont high school home with the pathfinder's strohmaier I turn the Mike over to you so we can introduce our superintendent Mister Austin Butte their gas yes thank you thank you yeah and I have the -- after the honor and a pleasure -- of introducing Mister Brookner best public servant former businessman who has worked for the past decade to make out Los Angeles is stronger community often precursors as a superintendent for LAUSD -- Mr bean or as service first that the mayor is the Los Angeles publisher the Los Angeles Times culture de LA twenty twenty commission and the LA unified advisory task force and founded vision to learn the organization provides free eye exams and glasses to low income children I met this to be very pride and remember so I used to work this is the deputy mayor -- for Richard J. Richard Riordan and he used to talk about this man all the time and the work that he's doing and it consider the source yes mayor Riordan had fallen on his bicycle in France I know this abusing her head of bicycle mishap and that maybe not be a bicyclist for the rest of my life -- but a he is -- someone I note passionately about what he wants to do and where you want to take LA U. S. B. two children that teach Cannella UST -- at the high school level I wish them much success because with his success both my children success as teachers in math and biology -- and I think that makes the whole system a lot better and with that to pretend thank you and I just it's my privilege to be here not only serving in this role -- but it's my privilege of Mr assembly member to work alongside you on this initiative thank you for years of commitment to this at Fremont because if we had been here not so many years ago at Fremont twenty percent of the kids were be graduates today will celebrate about eighty percent of graduating if we'd been here not so many years ago we treated our students as a challenger as a problem almost as criminals -- now we treat them -- each as individuals and provide them with the opportunity to succeed because we've got a bunch of schools in Los Angeles I'm have almost fourteen hundred schools we serve the needs of seven hundred thousand students and we know there is opportunity in everyone of those seats Calvet everyone of those seats but unfortunate opportunity insults work like this -- that we think will help make sure there is not only talented but opportunity in everyone of those seats so it's my privilege to be here -- today a free mind you would see wraparound services for counseling clinical care restorative justice -- and dramatically improve community engagement that's a start our students are staying with us for helping them graduate we still have a ways to go to make sure that they're each realizing their full potential so just let me share a few of the things that we are working on -- because we could spend days and weeks but I'm just gonna give a few highlights -- so since two thousand thirteen what we've been trying to do is reduce suspensions keep students with us given the chance to learn -- and we led the way with willful defiance and restorative justice practices so within a decade ago our students miss sixty thousand days -- to suspension this past year less than four thousand in addition state leaders led by the assembly member and others agreed earlier this month to an act into law to strengthen the policies to protect especially our youngest learners from suspensions related to will for the five thank you for your leadership on that that is making a difference are the next piece of our work and I think I see in the audience a few members of our -- force was here when the folks at the bunch center really brought some information or attention that was really troubling -- there almost twenty drug and alcohol related infractions on a list that in the past students would be arrested so permitted mark on the record for obvious see an issue work counseling a diversion -- and more support is needed so we put together task force our colleague from the bunch center the brotherhood crusade suits and solidarity and the social justice learning instead we spent the past six months developing a set of strategies to reduce the arrests and citations of students under fourteen in particular African American students who are over represented in that where we can provide counseling support opportunity learn from what is a mistake but just a mistake as a young person shouldn't more the record for life -- Esther assembly member we will be coming to you we like to you three investment fund -- for additional support -- I know I can kind of your support we need to make sure the rest of your colleagues understand the importance of this work because these are just numbers on a page is not just dollars but each of these investments represents the chance for -- young person have a better life so we appreciate your support on that -- the second if I brought in the lands of one of the things that we see here today if we took a tour campus you'd see that all of the needs of our students are not being met -- and we have a big challenge in public education on the issue of adequacy well just put in simplest terms if we were sitting at the high school in New York the investment any student would be about twenty nine thousand dollars a year two nine thousand dollars a year we're sitting at a high school here in Los Angeles and our funding is only about sixteen thousand dollars a year as a high school math problem twenty nine thousand minus sixteen thousand twenty nine minus sixteen I think that second or third grade and it's elementary and our great challenge or opportunity if we choose to look at appropriately is how do we all come together and make sure schools are adequately funded because adequate funding allows us to pay people working schools properly and fairly it allows us to make sure that we have smaller class sizes that we have the wraparound supports that are needed that we have all of the a to G. support an AP classes and beyond that our students need and deserve but the issue of adequacy is something we as a community have to address and if we don't address it we're going to be left with big opportunities that we cancer because we know what it takes we know that additional investment will pay enormous dividends not just to the students that were investing by the community as a whole so would appreciate your support on that are the work doesn't end today commitment as a school district with leaders like Mike for Meryl our fearless principal doctor Whitman others who day in day out to the work to make sure that we build on the success that we're having -- the increase graduation rates -- to make sure that each student has a chance to succeed in school life thank you thank you and taking time out of your day to come here this is really important and -- and I have been Askin I don't know how those leader run through your office I have a bill -- you mention at risk I have a bill to change the term at risk and take it out it occasion code other penal code call our young people have problems because and not dwell on what problems they had poured but look at them as as you said what big ultimately can be press and is on the governor's desk right now so of any kind of make a call for the letter anything you know how he'll have of my letter of support before the day's out Sir thank you thank you a because I think what we're collaborating on and working on is to think of every student and their fullest opportunity -- that growth mindset no deficit mindset so as we think of each student are opportunity I love the way you phrased it -- these are not students who are at risk their opportunity and it's our job to make sure they have the full opportunity and then the other thing is probably hopefully I'm able to get monies for pop sixty four to build these health centers like the one you have read Ana so we can collaborate with your ministration on what is the best way to distribute that money because I feel that we could be we're going to get the money one of the things that -- since we're broker just IBM relation of the community is the centerpiece of a lot of our work this year because Los Angeles unified serve students over some her square miles very different communities very different needs -- and so actually -- Mr Romero and his team are leading one of our efforts in the south where Fremont is to make sure that we are doing everything we can to restore the school as that center the community we think that a feeder pattern the community whether it's an elementary school to middle school to high school of the offering of services to children in the community and their families -- and wellness services are important part of that -- so we'd love to work with you on that because the coherence we can do around that to make sure the services are not disjointed there's a reason to provide service to the school children and families are here every day -- so the state coming along with funding is fantastic we need to bring our county partners into it different stream of funding to actually staff and I don't miss as good here who runs our mental health support and services will talk if she is not already about that but I think if we can think of the school as the center for everything we can to bring the community back in and provide that support there were other personalized of that thank you thank you at I do believe it will happen and not to put any more pressure on Fremont when I'm in the capital when I'm in Sacramento when I talk to the governor lieutenant governor to the Senate I talk about Fremont high school is being the example of what I want the future of education to be when it comes to mental health trauma care and all of that so -- and your stats that you mentioned I need more those stats like even been specially members that may be on the other side of the aisle who may not be as in like had I not sure what what side at all is because when the kids are the national of the other thing that I'll just mention since we are together I think we're gonna hosts -- bring together the LA delegation I would welcome got to be one of the hosts to do that because your leadership we need to bring whether there are sides they all outside of our own the kids out of the island and we need to talk about the entire delegation helping us to make sure we're making investments need in our schools here thank you and thank you for being here I don't know where I don't which has had some of okay often yeah all of from my fifty number one two three yeah yeah let's give the superintendent of big round of applause Bob so let's invite our first panel Dr AB do dual side he from -- my clinic asking dental from Daly UST division of health and Human Services Arturo Valdez chief academic officer for Los Angeles office of education could you comment have a seat so so I have staff here just in case anyone having trouble understanding what's going on probably don't understand what I'm saying right now if you to -- everyone of the land play everyone total okay so we'll begin with doctor Adel psyche from I thank you assembly member Jones Sawyer -- steam guests and panelists -- we're fortunate to have a second hearing here on the campus of -- Fremont high school the first one we hosted was in August of twenty seventeen on committee trauma informed care -- so we really -- welcome you back to the campus and again thank you for for having us here chief executive officer of all my communicable operates as wellness center here on the campus of Fremont high school well my clinics started from a small group of UCLA students responding to the health disparities in south LA up to said after the nineteen ninety two civil unrest and twenty seven years later organizational heart is in the same place we know how special it is to have a space that houses the greenhouse a community garden a committee clinics specifically for teens and community members and upcoming dental clinic all while sharing the campus with a high school in other community partners we're also fortunate to be hosting twice a month if free farmers market that provides over twenty five thousand pounds of food to the community with partnership with LA food forward despite all the amazing resources we have we want to do more to affect injustice injustice is our community faces we are honored here to speak on behalf of our community and the team of sixty staff members that make up in addition to our stern health leaders program it'll McKinney clinic at the core of our work every month at the view on campus is a need to provide pathways for students to be successful in mind body and overall health a body of research indicates that Los class time due to suspension expulsion and elimination results in early involvement with the juvenile justice system we cannot look at the school to prison pipeline without creating a framework of alternative models of justice in our schools and restorative justice practices at the core of this alternative framework according to Daniel Venice executive director for the center of justice and reconciliation of the prison fellowship a world recognized expert on restorative justice three core principles underlying the theoretical basis of restorative justice repairing harm stakeholder involvement in transforming the role of comedian governments the role of comedian government cannot be stressed enough and as a healthcare organization serving the campus of Fremont high school I'd like to focus some remarks on what we're doing to engage at a community level the entire Fremont high school student body is made up of black and brown students all of whom have been impacted in some way by the socio economic disparities that exist in south LA the student health leaders program of the mckinny clinic was created to reflects the student body giving students the power to tackle campus and community issues affecting health the criminal justice system and environmental inequities amongst others each cohort of students as part to advocate for themselves and issues that affect them the most teaching their peers to do the same in the process these topics usually merge general health race social justice issues in our campus and community events and partnerships of school clubs and committee organizations that are doing similar work south central LA is comprised of about fifty four thousand you under eighteen forty one percent of them living below the poverty level only six point six percent of this county has a bachelor's degree with just under fifty one percent of high school students graduating that alone is enough to inspire us to do more especially to the empowerment of students who are at opportunity and -- I really appreciate the assembly member going in that direction of changing language because language is important the sentencing project reported in twenty fifteen that California has six thousand seven hundred twenty six youth in custody with two times the amount of light necks and nearly nine times amount of black youth in custody compared with will their white counterparts in twenty sixteen the centre of juvenile justice and criminal justice reported that south central has some of the highest rates of felony arrest and state confinement with rising numbers of foster care youth ages ten to seventeen and sixty three percent of youth with mental health cases actively open simply put the members of our student health leaders program their friends and family and community members have have a higher likelihood of becoming a cycle of becoming part of a cycle that screw explosion criminalization in the face of health and community based disparities our leadership staff began considering ways to deepen our social justice impact to our programs with the development of a stand alone programs department are teens house was passed with addressing the social justice issues our students face and has been able to align their goals more clearly becoming more attended of ways of merging our clinical educational committee partnerships in serving the community we implemented a plan to increase support of the feeder elementary and middle schools within the almost service network an increase as soon health leaders program to sixteen students this year virtually started off with five students this year we are going to sixteen students with hopes expand reach to even more students in the years to come this work continues as part of our trauma and community informed care which is why we recently re branded giving the students side of the clinic its own name the -- much teen clinic so students would have a greater sense of ownership of the clinics seeing as a space that is more there's than anyone else's this didn't help leaders are especially excited because they help designing new outreach materials including a new logo which they now Pat probably were on campus the work we do as health practitioners cannot be done without the strong partnership in cloud of collaborative efforts alongside with LAUSD when Ellie is the adopted the discipline foundation policy in two thousand seven the district stated goal was to establish a framework for developing refining and implementing a culture of discipline conducive to learning the school wide positive behavior interventions support framework provides a systematic an evidence based approach for improving school relationships student behavior and learning outcomes based on this new implemented framework as we spoke about earlier if you look at the whole district suspensions have declined dramatically from a high of nearly seventy three thousand in two thousand five it just eighty eight thousand and as a superintendent Peter said about four thousand recently there's still much more work to be done and in tandem with these restorative justice practices on campus the path for can truly be transformative the on campus principal at school Val has offered her self as a resource fully committed to increasing for my high school graduation rate understanding the impact the first or second hand involvement with the criminal justice system can have an insurmountable effect on the success of students we are partnering with her the Fremont teachers the Los Angeles trusts for children's health a Los Angeles neighborhood land trust our teen clinic staff the student health leaders the school nurses psychiatric social work on campus the healthy start coordinator any newly hired restorative justice corner coordinator who will be working closely with us to do this work the we are showing proud of the impact we have have so far on campus we in to see Los Angeles county the state of California in the United States make a push to create more clinics like ours on school campuses in a recent behavior health focus group that we had at Wilma with our team clinics students click talked about there's shared solutions to disparities seen in our community regarding mental health they are in dire need of more counselors arts programs disciplinary version programs in spaces to truly feel heard and validated we look for departing with you all to create the solutions they aim to see and using health equity to build capacity in disrupting the public health crisis that is the school to prison pipeline thank you so could you quickly tell us what woman made sure we must answer university in medical Muslim association we're the first centers founded by American Muslims we serve the entire south Philly community and in two thousand thirteen we were so excited to expand our second location here on the campus of Fremont high school serving the students and their families -- we are a one of a kind facility Ellie UC's investment in Fremont high schools truly remarkable we have a one acre community garden a a community clinic is to maybe dental clinic and one of a kind greenhouse this is truly transformative in the work they're doing so I encourage you all to please stop by the clinic talk to our partners and see how you can join our efforts and also like the fact that it's multi cultural yes absolutely our staff is very diverse our our patients I diverse and it's really reflective of the community that we serve thank you good morning in my thirty years of the school social worker I have learned that being compassionate and caring does not require additional funding yep policies and funding are critical and necessary to breaking the pathway of cars serrations psychiatric hospitalizations and health emergencies as you have just heard LA unified has invested for many years towards the trajectory of wellness prevention and early intervention yet there's a lot more that we can do towards that while on this road an important way to begin is by building the capacity of all adults to know why and how they can support resiliency adults parents care givers in the school community play a pivotal role in promoting student outcome with proper funding and resources we can educate all school stakeholders about the science and the impact of trauma on talk to trial development learn about systemic change and opportunities to become from a resilient and form schools such as we are here at Fremont high school to build on individual community assets despite risk factors or a will now -- do -- as as which thank you very much for that and how each adult plays a role by teaching our children every day regardless of their age social emotional skills that are needed empathy anger management problem solving goal setting and so they can gain tools and strategies to address adversities the grief and many of the trauma triggers the experience for students to learn that the can counseling and mental health support throughout their lives spent is healthy and right for adults to build the capacity to understand what it means to be regulated so that they can be call regulating their children and also know when children are at risk and need additional support when them they demonstrate behaviors that may be harmful to themselves harmful to others or to stop students and adults were introductory towards violence if left untreated or a monitored or services lack we will continue to experience incidents that may lead to tragedies on campus or have to prepare for active shooters or tertiary services that we can prevent this is why I am so proud to represent LA unified today I can tell you what is working what we could expand on and we can build upon we need to fortify and build upon our current efforts we call for policies and prioritizing funding for school support teams as the one you have here at Fremont and many of other high schools to continue to fund academic enrichment programs and focus on prevention and early intervention I represent the division of student health and Human Services as executive director I read a represent over twenty five hundred professionals and support staff including nurses psychiatric social workers people services pediatricians child psychiatrist and many multi disciplinary professionals administrators and support personnel some of the work we do we do with partnerships internal and external and we focus on the whole child and when we look at data we know that our children are not all right we have over nine hundred diabetic students across the district every week we get the average are an additional five or so the numbers keep growing we have twenty one thousand students who have asthma and there's as our students are screened for vision we have a very as partners that have helped us green over two hundred fifty thousand students thirty six percent of the students did not pass this screening and we have been able to hand out over twenty seven thousand glasses because they needed them when we joint partnerships with our dental partners that's what's so exciting that you're gonna have a clinic soon let that last year we served over two thousand three hundred ninety six children and those children under when eighteen thousand or more procedures we first began to screen a look at the impact of trauma and our students twenty years ago with partners at UCLA and ran in our department of school mental health we have come a long way but we're still yet in the infancy stages of doing trauma informed work I'm proud to highlight some of our current practices and lessons learned last year we educated and build the capacity of all students as a priority implementing AB twenty two forty six which is enacted in California it required all school districts to train and and teach our teachers seven through twelve quite a suicide prevention LAUSD revised its policy to include all employees certificated classified administrators basically anybody who works with children is required to learn to be a protective factor by being trauma informed ninety three percent of our sixty five thousand employees completed the training last year and we're taking that training again this year we've also developer training for school support staff are without nearly five hundred psychiatric social workers and counselors who are trying to assess triage and develop safety plants across elementary middle and high schools we hope to help destructive of the pathway of self harm self injurious behavior and that way we can just -- and the trajectory towards school violence or violent threats to school community in response to the aftermath of parkland Florida beginning in July twenty eighteen we also launched a dedicated partnership with school police department student health and Human Services we teamed up mental health practitioners and school police officers to respond to self injurious behavior or threat to others these teams took over eighteen hundred fifty called the watch commander's office and LA school police once those calls were -- are activated they work triage and assessed for self just -- -- harm to self or or harm to others provided technical support and assistance assessment and risk and what ended up happening is that fifty three percent of the students were assessed on campuses and out of those twenty five percent of the students were hospitalized we really tried to stop our children from going to psychiatric hold which seems to be the the route that we were doing before an out of those cases we continue to do intensive case management to ensure that children get the right services the right district an external partnerships every month in LA unified we have -- we convene what we call the LA chart the lawcenter threat assessment resource -- response partners it involves school police LAPD department of mental health department of children family services the city attorney and other partners we look at risk factors that cases and we review students or any rest to develop develop a collaborative action plan and support to address any critical incident our students may be experiencing and mitigate threats and that way we can provide services and not wait until a tragedy occurs this year all schools will be mandated to receive a trauma informed professional development we're also developing a micro credential for teachers we have done universal screenings we started with a lot of individual therapy and group therapy and we've moved into classrooms we looked at eighteen thousand students and about a quarter of our students screened at high risk for traumatic stress another twenty percent screen for moderate risk what we do targeted screening in our clinics in our schools with parental consent more than eighty percent of our student report students report exposure to three or more stressful events drama is prevalent in their lives half of our students screen positive for PTSD twenty five percent of our students experience depression and twenty five percent also our screen positive for anxiety twenty five percent of all those students also report using substances so we are help build up on individual and group therapy and we are now doing class interventions and whole world a great approaches and school wide -- activities LAUSD operates its own mental health and health clinics and wellness centers as well as partnering with FQHCs like the one we do here at Fremont and as I mentioned earlier when children receive services at school sixty percent of them finish services versus when we refer out only ten percent of our children finished services we have children with comorbidity issues that means that you can have diabetes possibly also have asthma but also experience home in security or homelessness or have been in a foster home and have had multiple traumatic experiences as you now that leads for a child to have difficulty learning and taking on full academic potential we need funded policies necessary to pro provide support to the whole child to prevent and intervene early our focus is has been and school culture and climate physical and emotional safety we plan to increase the number of schools that are currently implementing trauma inform interventions and practices many have began to use meditation and mindfulness and some schools have also -- been trained in transit and -- meditation we will continue to refuse classrooms with social emotional and trauma informed curriculum as they take on their instructional methods and we have now also began to have staff and student wellness rooms where they can go and have a break we truly are facing a fork in the road either we continue to find pathology children needing to be hospitalized for psychiatric crises incarcerating are you youth in juvenile hall or having our children removed from their families or take another road towards wellness this work depends on investments of funding and policies to protect school communities they do services cannot depend on limited Kern -- school district general fund or school district grants or philanthropy we need to take on this opportunity to really find pathways and link learning so our children I mentioned also earlier we have a shortage of school nurses of social workers there's nothing better than the opportunity to raise our own school nurses and staff from our communities so we look forward to supporting your efforts to really -- be preventative in early inner intervention so that prison pipeline doesn't need to exist we have way too many other things to do and we are ready to implement them thank you thank you you mentioned trauma can you just give real quick the top two trumpeted domestic violence bullying violence industry what are the well that's interesting and poverty well poverty for sure our eighties eighty six percent or above eighty percent of our children arm free and reduced lunch -- when we talk about drama what are screening tools are not clinical as they can do in the clinic it was what we ask is have they been hit kicked or punched that they witnessed community violence and that the prevalence one of the ones that is increasing I just want to highlight is car accidents so please everybody be very safe with your social media I think that are accidents are more more of our children experience car accidents as well thank you to you I think we have an extra person there that you'll we do yes we do thank you -- assembly member Jones Sawyer for all of your hard work and dedication and being such a friend to education -- I am also proud to hear that both of your sons are teachers -- one of my son is also a teacher and LA unified and I couldn't be more proud of the work that he's doing back I'm sure you are so thank you for that and I know you also talked about legislators that are on the other side of the aisle that we want to in light yes and I referred to those legislators as at promise legislators absolutely the term should be shared with them as well because they do have promise and it's our responsibility to go out there and provide them the information that really tells the story of the need in our community I also want to thank Blanca ski there are principle here Fremont this is an absolutely beautiful school when I drove around I didn't know what was an unassigned day and I thought wow everybody's in class there's no one out there but I found it's an -- on the sign day but thank you my name is our total there's some the chief academic officer with the LA county office of education I'm here representing superintendent Deborah Eduardo couldn't be here today but I also brought with me Susan Chait is who works -- so much around social emotional learning in health services at lake -- just briefly the Los Angeles county office of education covers the area from Lancaster and Palmdale to Pomona to the mountains to the ocean it's about one point five million K. twelve students and part of our -- goal in our promises to make sure that we work with all eighty school districts to make sure that they have the tools they need to be successful so that's kind of what we're looking at an equity an axis is ki¬øm paramount the two words prison and education or school to prison bills are two words that should never ever be used in the same sentence and I think our goal here today is to Iraqi that and to never have those two words a used in combination I think our principal knows that her primary job is to support our teachers because if you support our teachers and they do their job effectively and efficiently and I know that there are barriers to academic success and that's where the the health and mental health component come into it we all need to work together no one's going to do it by themselves no teacher can do it by themselves no principle no superintendent no social worker we all need to bind together and say what's best for the community and for our parents that are sitting right there we work for you and we need to do a better job at working well together and that's really what this panel is all about saying that we need to to join arms and support you in your work as we move forward I wanted you to know that the county has -- an incredible relationship right now with the county mental health county health services department of public social services so much so that were opening up fifteen community schools throughout LA county -- many in this area as well and we're also opening up health clinics with the help of those centers as well so we're hoping to make some inroads -- with our partners and to talk a little bit about that is Susan Chait is with the Los Angeles county office of education thank you Mister Valdez in assemblyman Jones Sawyer it is a pleasure to be here and to talk about some of the specific things the LA county has to offer and the partnerships in the things that were working with school districts so really we're looking at the whole child how do we support that child the family in making the school a hub for that community as well and later has looked at two initiatives in particular looking at the trauma and resiliency inform schools and we started that last school year we're looking at how do we support our staff and students and looking at so that their understanding where our children are coming from and providing the best support that they can at the schools we also as Mr Valdez had mansion looking at starting off the school year the community schools initiative again we're looking to make the school a hub for bringing in services not only increasing the capacity of the services of that the school site but also looking at bringing in the county departments bringing out community based organizations and pulling the men helping them to be able to support students and are on our schools but also the families as well sue we are very proud that we've been able to look at -- some collaborations with Lake over LA county office of education which is department of mental health department of public health UCLA in their center for excellence and we have been collaborative working to bring services to do increase capacity of not only of our administrators are teachers but also the support staff that surround to make that village for students in the schools we also work with -- I can the interagency council on child abuse and neglect and in particular looking at some of the mental health issues and looking at health issues of students that are -- have suicidal ideation that are considering that and how do we support them so we look at trends of what has occurred in the past we look at specific cases and then we make recommendations for the county to be able to implement some of these things we're also working with the LA county suicide prevention network the department of mental health in particular on the school and youth work group and we put together a framework for strategic strategically looking at how do we support students in decreasing the risk of -- suicide decreasing -- providing not only policy -- as per AB twenty two forty six but also looking at how do we provide interventions how do we provide for students that are returning to school after an attempt how do we support them in making sure that we're providing that safety net for them as well as any other students it might be at risk as well we're also working with department of mental health -- regarding there's there -- threat assessment so we're looking at how can we be prepared to make sure that we having this safe environment for students at school and looking at not only -- mental health supports but emergency preparedness looking at -- active shooters and looking that again providing that safe environment for students we've also been looking at this year we are expanding and in collaboration with not only at lake up in collaboration with the California department of education expanding training of youth mental health for state for staff to be able to support students as well in this is part of the cal stop which looks at providing free training for any schools any districts on youth mental health for state and also working through sandy hook promise to provide school prevention our school violence prevention models and training for them and so we have been an active part of that and will be expanding those services through our schools and districts this school year or also expanding and incorporating into lego being able to provide restorative practices training for our schools of the bacon and incorporate those practices into their school site we also have -- through our center for distance online learning we have something called support to otherwise known as suicide prevention ongoing resilience trainee we also have to deal which is a teaching education through the arts for learning and so again looking at how do we support that social emotional learning for students how do we make that environment so that the classroom the campus itself is a supportive environment and recognize they were not looking to push you out of school we're looking at what can we do to put to support you and keep you in school and recognizing any of the challenges and how do we train those and opportunities for students and so we're very excited about all the work that we're doing and again anyone who wants to reach out and look at services at Los Angeles county office of education but yes it is important that our students support staff again it's nice to be see that that's been a focus that it's not just in the classroom in the academics but how do we support again the whole child -- the services that they need including not only their physical well being but there mental well being and making this particular with the mental well being is decreasing the stigma so that it's it's okay to get support it's okay to keep yourself healthy physically and mentally and so again we thank you for at how do we increase our capacity as well our staffing and looking at school nursing school school social workers and school counselors because they are key and some of those wraparound services for our schools sec thank you very much thank you let's give up a hand a plus for a school based health services panel thank you now will bring up we are factors -- panel number two or will Thomas government affairs director California immigrant policy and professor Robert Hernandez from my alma mater university southern California school of social work are there any are there any parents here in a crowd you Reyes grandparents welcome welcome hopefully you heard that we your identical part of this I'm glad issue here not only to hear it but hopefully get some input from you so thank you for being here so when every year ready for or will first then your family member Jones Sawyer addition to the explicit threats against their communities immigrants and refugees are often unknowingly subjected to external pressures that drastically impact the outcome of their lives this opportunity to examine environment examine environmental factors affecting the state's immigrant communities is critical to reducing California school to prison pipeline ensuring that this population is part of California success it should come as no surprise to the members of the committee to the assembly member and to the community that the current federal ministration has major priority to foster anti immigrant fervor in America features such as the department of homeland security's public charge rule change set to go into effect on October fifteenth we'll weaponized safety net programs for immigrants looking to enter into the country or apply for status change the permanent residency county social service programs already reporting a high rate of dissing Roman for programs that keep immigrants and their families fed help the in house in this policy change one which California is suing to prevent effect that will adversely affect generations of school children families who will have to live their lives in poverty and without access to the mental and physical health care they so desperately need for this committee hearing I will speak to the factors that immigrant and refugee students may be exposed to that could potentially affect their performance at school programs in existing services that are effective and specific areas that we can improve upon to mitigate the effect of environmental factors was the finding cited in my remarks can be found in the healthy mind for the future report a collaboration from the California policy center and the children's partnership that was released in two thousand eighteen in that report immigrant families interviewed across the state levels of fear anxiety and uncertainty about their futures with half of California's children having at least one immigrant parents and one in six children having at least one undocumented parents the fear of being detained or deported manifests itself to behaviors of local school district level for example Oxnard Union High School district the former parents to provide instructions for the school on next steps in the event that the parents are deported research suggests that this fear keeps families from fully participating in American society in addition to the threats from federal officials students and families must deal with the trauma that comes from balling at the hands of other students immigrant youth ages sixteen to twenty one have openly acknowledge that billion anti immigrant sentiments have impacted their daily lives at school immigrants participating in the study also said that they felt the general public seems to be more emboldened to make racist and discriminatory remarks since the election of president trump pediatricians expressed the current environment is creating a toxic stressed to children which will result in increased chronic disease and mental health disorders in adultery and wobbling is an issue not exclusive to the immigrant community it is important to note that the fax it will have on our community as they may have limited English speaking skills and limits support on campus one of the respondents to the survey said pulling is one of the roughest experience for a lot of students who are newly arrived immigrants outside of the school environment immigration status plays a role in family engagement for students parents see their own immigration status as a barrier to the dreams and goals that they have for their children school officials interviewed talk about parents being disengage from the children's school activities because of our country's current anti immigrant climate this level of separation between parent and school means students may miss out on valuable services such as free and reduced lunch applications and also result in reduced participation in parent teacher or parent administrator meetings that may be required and now comes the good part there are examples of existing and effective programs and services all in for safe schools is a coalition of statewide partners that works with the California department of education to further support children in immigrant families on school campuses benefits from this coalition include distributing of materials hosting committee conversations and having trainings on from one form curriculum Senate bill fifty four passed in two thousand seventeen the California values that contains an often overlooked sensitive locations provision that requires specific public of locations including public schools to adopt a model policy that guides their response in the face of any immigration enforcement activities the one California program which is operated by the California department of social services went from a one time to an ongoing funded program passed this past year along with legal service funding this year the state allocated five million dollars for two new pilot programs one of which allows for mental health assessments and the other which will find a navigator program to connect immigrants receiving services with wraparound services if successful this would provide an opportunity to begin integrating mental health into the state's immigrant integration efforts and would allow for program that could be expanded to provide trauma informed care the California policy center has many recommendations for helping to mitigate the anti immigrant environmental effects the California is currently facing the limited to three for the sake of time and so that we can have more talk in Sacramento one policy first we need to strengthen community safety to ensure children youth and families feel secure and supported in their communities this includes state and local agency administration staff supporting the full implementation of Senate bill fifty four as well as assessing steps local health clinics are taking to identify existing service gaps this is even more important as immigrant communities encounter fear and confusion over the public will charge change and limit their participation public services and programs community help would also mean encouraging schools to address school climate in their local control and accountability plan second recommendation is to invest in community based approaches and a community based workforce of support immigrant families this includes expanding of the mental health services that school based health programs can provide the students a perfect example is right here Fremont and third we would like to improve access coordination integration of services to reduce the barriers for immigrant families is means including schools offering say spaces to host communities questions on sentiments around immigration issues and encouraging partnerships with community organizations and schools to host know your rights trainings to educate the community members on the latest public policy changes in regards to immigration in ending it's been twenty five years since California voters passed the racist and xenophobic prop one eight seven since then our state has served as the leader on immigrant integration and inclusion we must continue to hold California's up hold California's values of equality in compassion to move our country forward during this time of uncertainty thank you thank you back assemblymember thank you for having us -- I do like the app promise her you know when I was doing my graduate studies earlier at USC I came across what I was calling in the collected population and and people were saying what are you talking about I was like well it's what society categorizes as getting involved getting affiliated view and as I explored further I realize once a youth becomes in gauge with the criminal justice system getting a line strengthens by eighty eight percent based on research those like are we creating the issue so how do we look at front and types of strategies and treatment which you have been doing throughout your career so now trimming AB promise is the step to go there at risk to the factors but they are not from a deficit understanding right so thank you for that -- today I will be focusing on the impact environmental factors have on healthy youth development with the focus specifically on youth violence as a primary area of concern what we continue to over look is this whole issue of rapid development terrible development Weber calling gentrification and its impact on health youth development the identified intractable problem through all of this is what is called violence related trauma and its relationship to challenges faced by urbanized view to limit the find violence related trauma for you violence related trauma is any relationship this for condition by which an individual or a group violates the physical social and or psychological integrity of another person or group so it's not strictly physical harm the psychological integrity of another group has more severe repercussions on our community members and we just heard from our previous speaker studies indicate that there is a twenty two percent increase of trauma exposure for communities known as enclaves which we find in your district go union what's going on the list goes on twenty two twenty two percent increase of trauma exposure now that's equated and I hate to do this but it's equated because it's the only other data that I could compare to troops doing a tour of duty it's hot or higher than a trip doing a tour of duty in a war torn country that level trauma exist in our community in our backyard where we sit today so I want to also mention that within these impoverished enclaves there's an escalation of fragmented institutions economic insecurity lack of opportunity amplifying psychological barriers for its community members brown's indicates that there is a high prevalence of violence exposure injured by urban youth living in impoverished enclaves whether as victims or witnesses studies nationwide also indicate detrimental impacts on a young brain due to violence exposure again this isn't just physical harm this is also what we call structural arm study after study indicate that unaddressed trauma for youth residing in disenfranchised communities can have detrimental effects on youth and families increasing the likelihood of violence due to stress placed on community members it's here where I'm going to highlight we need to look at what types of assessment tools were using to capture this evidence that impacting and compromising the integrity of our youth development foster defines this as drama Chiu Jean experiences resulting in severe psychological distress applying certain theories such as multiple marginality by Diego V. hill helps is better understand the historical and structural dynamics of community subject to violence when we apply this framework it reveals a strong correlation of urban youth engage in violence due to strain caused by urbanisation rapid development were seen here in the city and county of Los Angeles with the gentrification of communities specifically how it's impacting our communities of color something to be aware and I really feel assembly member you could champion the effort to really look at how this is impacting our youth and community members which were largely overlooking were seen it with the increase of homelessness today so Adam bird bird tell defines this phenomena as structural violence he defined structure violence as systematic ways in which social structures harm or otherwise disadvantaged individuals such as policing practices use of zero tolerance and the list goes on the on attended re triggering of complex traumas which is the cumulative repetitive traumas experience by institutional failures intensifies the psychological wounding of community members and Abbott documentation that I could submit to your office later on this this has also been framed as synergetic trauma so we're going to a deeper landed or trauma not just domestic but how it actually impacts as from a structural lands case in point I had a youngster come into my office and he lives in one of these areas that are being gentrified up springs a coffee shop no surprise for any was Mister I'm gonna go in and and I'm gonna give it a try he goes into this coffee shop and he said you know what they look at me as if I was a foreigner he left still live in he goes do you understand I go for generations back in this community and they're looking at me as a foreign there's no coincidence that there's up taking graffiti as well the sign of certain fractures to communities in hell they're still trying to really show that they're still part of the community in a very assertive play that's what I'm seeing happen this also has been framed S. intergenic trauma as I said before the substance abuse and mental health services administration stamps of further identifies this as historical trauma Sam ser associate this type of trauma with the racial and ethnic groups in the United States who have suffered major intergenerational losses and assaults on their culture and while being a study conducted by Yang of the neural science poverty project at the university of southern California concludes that areas subjected to violence excessive noise que es at home pollution mall nutrition abuse and parents without jobs can had detrimental impacts on a young bring hi a stocky also knows how the problems of housing discrimination unsafe living environments racism and underfunded schools affect brain development there's a strong correlation study after study indicates that unaddressed trauma for youth residing in impoverished enclaves whether due to discriminatory policies like immigration public charge migration urbanization development gentrification red lining and policing practices has detrimental effects on youth and families manifesting itself as under achievement in schools high rates of drug use abuse dangerous sexual behavior gang activity and violence exposure that's why are you are at risk the environment makes them at risk and they have so much promise that's been overshadowed by these factors the national center posttraumatic stress disorder indicates that close to forty percent let me let me highlight this forty percent of urban youth develop posttraumatic stress disorder forty percent why are we up in arms right now if it was inserted communities people would be up in arms forty percent that's higher then a soldier coming back from a tour of duty not to down play with the printer the forty percent this there appears to be a gap in research specific to violence related trauma expose report urban youth making this a pressing area to explore further assembly member and we need to today the state of California we know the costs ninety five thousand two hundred fifty two thousand dollars to incarcerate one juvenile for one year between the ages of seven to eighteen years of age nationally Acosta roughly an estimated four hundred and seven dollars a day to incarcerate when you end up to one hundred forty eight thousand seven and sixty south seven dollars per user per year as opposed to investing prevention intervention treatment at Acosta anywhere from ten thousand to fifteen thousand dollars annually blueprints for youth development of behavior health science institute shows that incorporate in and Bective evidence based treatment model such as multisystem make their pre the list goes on which takes a multifaceted system approach has a reduction in recidivism rates for juveniles from anywhere to seventy to seventy five percent that's roughly and this also includes a reduction in convictions for aggressive youth crimes at a cost of seven thousand dollars to invest in of infective treatment model financially the smarter to invest in front end treatment than to continue to do this reactive response which taxpayers have entered I'm a big proponent of the debate youth development taking what youth you are framing as youth promise how do we get it from thriving used to floor seen use our assessment tools also not contrary to certain research today we can't just look at the adverse affects impacting our youth we need to look at the strength some people call resilience basically it's survival skills and how do we look at the survival skills and incorporate measures that invest in their healthy youth development firm of positive youth development assessment strategy and implementation approach thank you and I and I would have you bring that information so that we can make the big thing about what we're trying to do is develop of policies legislation removed for with and then budget request so if we could have a follow up meeting with both of you are how we can turn this into something tangible would be great thank you again could you give them a round of applause and now we're for our last panel to discuss per rational -- development in addressing unconscious bias in the classroom okay I have harm say th√†nh California for justice Ingrid canal my good friend Ingrid from the California federation of teachers and sherry Taylor from the Los Angeles county office of education positive behavior interventions and support hi push the button on the echo hello thank you assembly member -- and one also thanked the community here Fremont for having us here today -- again my name is Khan on the policy analyze director California's for justice we are a statewide youth powered organization be fighting to improve the lives of communities of color immigrant low income LGBT Q. and other marginalized communities here in California we have offices in Oakland San Jose Long Beach and Fresno and part of why I'm here today three lift up the work that's happening in Central Valley -- we know that there's a lot of folks in places like Central Valley there are struggling but sometimes we forget that many of these folks are people of color immigrants in the document of folks part of our work is closing the achievement gap -- but we've also identify something called a belief gap which we see the product of unequal expectations based on race and zip code students confirm that teachers have higher expectations the white students and students of color for example black students we are compatible test scores to white students were about half as likely as white students to place and gifted programs this gap between what parents and students of color believe they can do and what teachers and administrators believe they're capable of capable of confined to potential students of color on a power point out to be of speak a bit to that -- a solution our students identified to kind of close to billion gap is to really build trusting and empowering relationships between students and school staff most of us agree with this we can probably all think about a teacher or school staff who made an impact on life who helped us believe in our potential unfortunately not all students have that experience school climate survey data show that one in three students in California could not identify a single caring adult in school one of our students and Fresno has said that they feel teachers see then the subject to be managed you walk of the school you see large gates you see police cars surveillance cameras the school has more school resource officers in mental health counselors in office as one of the large window panes that separate you from the people working office like the ones they have in prison -- I also separately from California justice also organizer prisoners in Oregon state penitentiary and actually a lot more parallels between how admin teach tree students and how the O. three prisoners in the penitentiary for a lot of students the only the only time they have interactions with principles in the school administration is when they're in trouble and the only interactions you have leadership in your school isn't healthy then your relationship with your school is going to be a healthy our campaign are right now we few relationships are critical for educational success and social emotional development research shows suit relationships between students and staff decrease students suspensions absences and drop outs and increase graduation rates test was in school climate relationships are critical for students of color who often have less supportive relationships with teachers California for justice launch our relationship sentence was campaign in twenty fifteen at the ten months of you flat action research a survey two thousand students in interview six five education leaders we found their relationships are the key to addressing systemic racism in schools and closing the belief gap students are not driving this equity focus improvement efforts at districts and school sites across California relationship center schools build upon existing after is the address races and in schools throughout through restorative practices community schools and student parent voice and recruiting retaining teachers of color we define relationships and our schools as one that unite social emotional learning in academics ensure all students reach their full potential regardless of race or zip code provide staff with the capacity and conditions connect with students address trauma the resilience and confront bias to create healthy relationships and leave together with students parents and staff working towards a shared vision having healthy relationships with adults in school can really make or break your school experience we have student and grain who has a strong relationship with one of our teachers was also fact the adviser for the black student union and she said just being able to have conversations rainy were black history to natural hair has created a safe space for her in the classroom it creates trust and support and to start this process of healing the trauma the many black and brown students experience in schools no the next line thank the three core conditions to create a relationship Senate school that we've identified are one valuing student voice this roping racism in our education system requires a stem systemic approach that addresses all three phones racism internalize interpersonal institutional I noting students internalized racism begin valuing them seeing them as hole and then an unbroken bring brimming with potential and experts capable of teaching and learning to investing staff shifting the culture and climate schools requires us address interpersonal racism by investing in our staff to pass city to deeply within the students to brave the talk about the impact of racism in our schools and to both the act by sending practices that build relationships based on mutual appreciation and accountability and three great space for relationship building the four point five million students of color in California are really calling on a third reimagine schools to transform the institutional racism that is inherent in the fact the amount of education with the prioritize the social and emotional development and unique needs and interests of students of color students quality preschools where every single young person feels like they belong in are safe and supported to succeed a key role state policymakers can play in helping us to really create relationships in a schools are through policy in budget priorities and investment staff communication initiative and the school crime initiative that we have organized run past would love to continue to to see more investment in our two other priorities that we want to talk about on that are particularly relevant in Central Valley are bilingual educators and community schools for bilingual teachers it is important for students to have healthy relationships with teachers who speak the same language of them a lot of students learn about the ports programs and other resources to their teachers and having a teachers and speak that same languages you really opens up of resources California for justice English learner students identify bilingual staff is one their main needs one of our students pointed out why having a bilingual consular is helpful whenever I don't understand she talks to me she showed me examples to make sure everything's okay she asked how you are doing your classes will kind of help you need he sometimes give me information about some opportunities that I can take he told me about the summer internship these courses about cybersecurity and I'm taking it because I'm interested in computer science and computers in general show me to get en she's been really helpful Central Valley has a large population of what hockey in long and can jobs student when we talk about language accessible resources we also need to be investing in binding with teachers and Central Valley is not alone in this need about thirty eight percent of K. twelve students California have been or are currently English learners on the for communities schools and offices and talk about that briefly on there are kind of schools who are packed in these models out there there adopting some of these practices these are public school was a partner with families in Kenya organizations to provide opportunities for student success you community schools though community schools in the could be different depending on whether at our partners at the partnership for future learning have identified community schools is having four pillars that first one is integrated student support recognizing that students social and emotional development are linked with academic learning some of the most common services and supports a medical dental and mental health care services tutoring in our other academic support resources for families such as parent education classes job training and placement services housing assistance and nutrition programs number two expanded in rich learning time and opportunities community schools provide students with as much as one third more learning time in which they experience arts physical activities mark group or individualized academic support and hands on learning activities across a range of subject areas number three active in family community engagement I mean of course prioritize meaningful and ongoing gave me the families and community members and establish the systems structures and supports the make it happen from partnering with parents to develop and promote a vision for student success offering courses activities and services for parents in communion Amer screening structures and opportunities for shared leadership and number for collaborative collaborative leadership practices this bill act as the glue that connects all the other pillars examples of this include professional learning communities Sybase team charged with improving school passing passion teaching and learning labor management collaborations and future development strategies such as peer assistance in review say we are living in a unique moment right now in this country experiencing different forms our passion we are experience really differently so I think it is important that we also see this moment as an opportunity to really bring people into space about education and I think we have an opportunity to be the re invasion what public education can look like in the state -- and that vision often means a radical shift in how we think about schools in the people in them really humanizing our students by seeing rations ships as a foundation to students of fast and putting in work with the folks in this room to make that happen thank you thank you you know is it on yeah my name's in very good now I'm here representing the California federation of teachers I am also a member of United teachers Los Angeles some banner yeah we're we're high tech over here when the high tech over here you are so I want to read a quote by Eli Weisel Holocaust survivor the opposite of love is not hate it's an difference the opposite of art is not ugliness it's a difference the opposite of faith is not heresy it's indifference on the opposite of life is not death it's in difference and I think that relates to a lot of what we're talking about in here I'd like to say thank you to assembly member Jones Sawyer for hosting this on the second of four hearings -- on the school to prison pipeline I also want to say -- we actually should change that to the school to prison to deportation pipeline I did not come up with that so don't give me credit I was at another training probably about a year or two ago and that's very important -- across California and -- some of some of our other states that once our students get into prison if they're not here legally they will much more easily be deported so let's just put that in our lexicon the school to prison to deportation pipeline -- somebody mentioned earlier -- the the assembly bill I think is assembly bill they -- we are not allowed to suspend for willful defiance and it brought down our suspensions an alley UST by the thousands or tens of thousands and that's great but it's it's a false narrative because we don't actually have systems in place that support our students of course even if you're not allowed legally put to suspend of course those numbers are going to drop but that doesn't mean the support or the student behavior has improved so it's really a false narrative that I would like to get away from and I supported that legislation when it came because I don't think that we should suspend for willful defiance when the teachers are in the classrooms with overcrowded classrooms en L. A. U. S. T. in much much of the state of California there really are in a bind when a child is cussing and they have forty other students and their their holding that class hostage so when we talk about the suspension rate has declined fabulous let's have a real narrative and say that that has not brought on the support that we need for our students I'm glad also that that superintendent beauty of our are things that we went out on strike for in U. T. LA we went out on strike for the schools our students deserve we went out on strike to and random searches this is one of our T. shirts students not suspects we don't want to criminalize our children in a place of learning I have to say I was a little taken aback when I drove up here on a people free day and saw police cars in front of the school I don't think that we should normalize that so one of the things we went out on strike for was ten random searches on our schools and not only did we get that but the school board then voted to end them across the district but I want to make you aware something that happened a Dorsey -- within the last month there was a Malay or whatever you want to call it of some students and the the the school police pepper sprayed the students at Dorsey and Dorsey is a school that is predominantly students of color so I don't I hope that we're not going to get into a situation where we and random searches and we replace it with something else that's toxic like pepper spray in our students we really need the supports in place superintendent Brough user spoke about community schools that was another thing that we went out on strike for community schools and this this for Fremont high school is absolutely beautiful it's my first time here and to know that there are systems in place to support the students and the families of this community are amazing I can you imagine if we have that at all of our over nine hundred campuses a man I would thank you ready I was a seventeen and a half year teacher at Robert hill lane elementary school which is an east area right across the street from Robert hill I'm sorry from east LA college can you imagine if we had health services at all of our schools so I'm glad the superintendent superintendent pewter is on the bandwagon for community schools because we had to go out on strike for that and I'm glad that he's on board and I really hope that the that the state of California find more of those because the federal government is and in the funding I do have notes here so you can take me out of the classroom but you can't make me not be a teacher so I brought my reality -- we as people that are white and I'm looking around and I may be one of the only ones in here need to be more than just not races we need to be actively anti racist we need to stand up and be allies of our students of color are communities of color are friends of color we can't just sit back and say well I don't burn crosses are I don't wear a hood that's great don't do that but also be out there and actively support our students be more than just not races to be actively anti racist conscious bias and the definition is unconscious bias either social stereo types about certain groups of people the individuals from outside their own conscience -- from outside their own conscious awareness everyone holds and conscious beliefs about various social and identity a group and these by see stem from one's tendency to organize social world by categories and unconscious biases former prevalent been conscious prejudice and are often incompatible with one's conscious values certain scenarios can activate unconscious attitudes and beliefs for example by cities may be more prevalent when multi tasking or working under pressure so when we as teachers at the school site and hopefully and community schools across the state that would be amazing we can bring the things into our classroom here's another teaching her that says education not deportation on Tuesday's utility members were read every week so I've got a lot of teachers another -- group that we can support if you're if you're an ally or if you're black black lives matter LA and this is one that -- are you tell a racial justice task force made and all the great if you can't see it it said in our class we believe black lives matter women's rights are human rights no human is illegal Xena phobias wrong love is love and kindness is everything so we have to actively show that we believe in our students that we believe in our communities I'm gonna wrap up soon ready I did bring some other -- books that if you're educate if you're an educator or if you're somebody that supports is for white folks to teach in the hood and I actually heard the speaker this summer in in DC and one of his quotes I'm gonna get it wrong but it was something to the effect of you are somebody's ancestor teach like it so for the future generations when I die when might you know three great grandchildren generations down to be teaching to make them proud or am I going to be teaching to make them want to you know not recognize teaching for black lives there's a black lives matter week in February I think it starts February seventh of twenty twenty don't quote me on that date but teaching for black lives and when we teach for black lives that means that we don't teach for other lives it means that were recognizing the black students at that time -- wait fertility why it's so hard for white people to talk about racism why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria they're teaching tolerance has a movement to have -- an integrated lunch week where you sit with students was students that they don't normally sit with to integrate the the -- campus and push out the criminalization of black girls in schools somebody mentioned earlier hair why do we have to actually make a law about legalizing somebody's hair but we did Holly Mitchell brought that and it's now law in the state of California the we legalize hair my hair would never be illegal and there's a problem with that so when we talk about what educators need we need to address their unconscious bias and we need to do it in a meaningful manner I Tuesday PT that's one hour after the teachers of worked all day isn't sufficient I to the -- Saturday where they're coming for three hours and getting paid twenty five dollars is insufficient if we want to systemic change we need an investment from the state of California into professional development for educators and for all of the adults on the campus and with that I'm going to and next thank you so much and I couldn't agree more with my other two colleagues sitting here and I'm very pleased to be here Sherrie Taylor I'm Los Angeles county office of education and assembly member Jones Sawyer you are man after my own heart I believe in the power of words and I believe that speaking promise versus speaking from a deficit model is empowering and principle as the file as I walk through your hallways I see I saw all of your the parts that you and your staff have put up and I can only imagine how empowered the students feel here and it it just touched my heart for the moment I walked on to the campus of thank you I think you family members community members students for being here and for sharing in this very important issue and coming using and being willing to step up and use your voice is so important so I wanted to mention someone I'm not sure if you're familiar with her but doctor to rent that Carter Andrews is a professor at the Michigan university for the teacher education department and there she teaches about multi culturalism and about a critical race theory and she talks about she talks to new teachers about how to enter into the the teaching profession and really go de a reflective deeply about what it is the thing you want to do in terms of touching the lives of their students and building the kinds of relationships that are going to make them the kind of teacher that people are that those students are going to remember for a positive reason she says the teachers want to address their biases like you're talking about they want to be able to be open about that but it's very difficult for them to find a safe space that they need so that they can talk about something that they're feeling without feeling like they're going to be poorly evaluated for something that maybe they don't even know why the the feel a certain way why they might have a certain bias they often don't feel that they have the time so she says something that rings true with me is that we need to move past just having one diversity to get house just making it a theme that we show up to and we -- embrace that one day we need to embed this very important work and to our day to day reflections and are David day work it takes critical self reflection and it takes critical love to do this work you can't have the two separated and so touching the hearts of children starts with touching the lives on the minds of the adults who work with the children every day and there on the frontline so every day we need to be asking ourselves how does money social location my class my gender my worries my religion how does the dot in fact an impact mine mine set water those kinds of not even know that I have we all have implicit bias like it or not we all have that and so we all have to address that on a daily basis we have to ask ourselves how can we know more about what we don't know how do we know more about how to address the biases that we carry around with us maybe from childhood he may be some things that we thought came from a dinner conversation that happened we were little and it just kept on living into our life somehow so it's up to us to figure out what that is and to pull it out and look at it and not be afraid to talk about it -- and then how do we continue as leaders and education and nots leaders in the classroom doubts leaders in administration how to we all come together and be very courageously old about addressing issues of power racism and implicit bias it's not a one and done application so I want to talk to you about positive behavior interventions and supports because when I talk about these things about how do I how I can know what I need to do but if I'm operating and a system with an a school where I don't however that Steve space and I don't have that time built in because that's not the culture of the school I'm probably never going to be doing that except at night before I lay my head down on the pillow so I want to tell you about that it's an evidence based framework for supporting schools to be double safe consistent I an equitable for all students but knowing what we've talked about their different layers of what we look out for all students we can't be afraid to look at what are some of those barriers that impact students of color and students of poverty and a different way than all the rest of the students but never the less that that all means all is -- critical for the work that we do in positive behavior interventions and support it's recognize P. I. S. is recognized and indicated by both individuals with disabilities and Education Act ID a and every child succeeds act esse or E. at that day the I. S. as a multi tiered system of support that when it's embraced by everyone at the school not means everyone of the also all staff whether it's -- teachers administrators support staff -- that parents family members everyone community members -- it is a way of enhancing the adoption and implementation of a continuum of evidence based practices to achieve important outcomes for students that are academic social emotional and behavioral the I. S. is critical for supporting all students in the local context through a trauma informed and equitable system the I. S. allows for offense with county office of education and over three thousand other educational agencies in California to utilize the systematic framework to reduce bias in our schools so how is this accomplished we can't talk about anything if we what we always say in P. V. I. S. if you talk about P. B. I. S. and you don't talk about data then you don't have people yeah yeah because you really need to know it's not just about how you feel things are going has a lot of times you can feel that things are really going well but you have to find out how things are really working and how well things are being implemented so we know that the national child and traumatic stress network from UCLA and Duke university's tell us that students who have experienced trauma need environments that are all beings P. V. I. S. that are predictable safe positive consistent and equitable and yeah I as has made a significant impact on children who have experience simple and complex trauma the I. S. allows for an integrated and collaborative teams that comes together after school but they include those teams include family members they include community members they include students because we can't leave any voices are heard and so the P. V. I. S. team is the one that creates that plan for that school in that context no one is coming in and saying this is a program you use this is the curriculum we use we can't tell you how we give you tools but that's up to the people who live out the school day in and day out to make that difference for their their students and their staff it's all about improving quality of life so we say if you're implement the P. B. I. as in you're not feeling pretty good about it something needs to be tweaked with the system and and -- and improve so the -- at the I a support schools in creating an environment to respond to student needs for a comprehensive structure using data systems and practices the I. S. has over twenty years of research demonstrating positive outcomes for students and this decreasing disproportionate holiday in their research the fact of school Y. P. B. I. S. on disciplinary exclusions for students with disabilities and out without disabilities doctors Nicholas cage and Nicole it gracefully boring focused on schools who have implemented PP I as with fidelity a tier one with fidelity these outcomes showed a student any student in the school is thirty seven percent less likely to have received one out of school suspension I has panic student is thirty three less likely to have received one out of school suspension with PP I as simply a student is thirty seven percent less likely to have received one or more out of school suspension a black student is thirty five less likely thirty five percent less likely to lose a day of instruction due to out of school suspension a student is thirty five percent less likely to lose a day of instruction due to out of school suspension a student with a disability is sixty nine percent less likely to Brough you referred to an alternate setting for disciplinary reasons so I agree with you and that is my voice people who look like me need to up we need everyone's voice I'm not saying that -- if you were to open my childhood and look at it I had issues of domestic violence of my family I had issues of all kinds of other things I still benefitted from the socio economic system that we have in the United States just because of the color of my skin you wouldn't know those things about me those are things probably a lot of us might have in common but there are so many other layers and I am going to use my voice I always have and they plan to for the rest of my life to be able to get the word out there about what we need to do to make our schools to be all of the things that we protect the ball that we talked about predictable and safe and positive and -- consistent and equitable so if I had a dream market to fill -- I would ask for some consideration in in the magical world of the legislature that you live in that we would -- in addition we've already put the -- we've already put positive behavior interventions and supports support into the new teacher standards wouldn't it be a beautiful world if we really did require a system of support that's PVI as in all of our schools and our wonderful state of California that would be my of my little wishlist but thank you so much for this opportunity I'm so grateful to -- speak on behalf of AB from the students thank you thank you can get it my hand round of Los thank you -- the the one thing that I kind of heard in in and is going to help me when I go back -- we talked about non minorities teachers and -- being able to understand the plight of what's going on unfortunately -- I should add that there are after American Latino legislators who advocate for policies that are detrimental to rural communities I've after American legislators to advocate for mandatory minimums three strikes longer sentences I'd like Tino legislators that talk about criminals who are immigrants on the floor the assembly so we also have some work to do among our own people too so it's not just non people of color and so we have to a lot of work to do all the way around -- so where were read the end but we also gonna have I don't recall the open Mike but we if there any questions or things that you would like for the legislation to work on if that might at Mike is there and if and if we've answered all your questions as good

see on -- I'd rather put up with me that you think are most are from the by the rest my throat if we're lucky for me that directed me briefly summarize translation here I mean yeah that's not -- she said she wanted to use our self her name is a nearly as you the parent here -- at this high school and she just wanted to note that since two thousand seven she's heard a lot about school wide support systems but in the past ten years she hasn't seen a full implementation of programs to really support students and -- she notes sort of the number of detentions that used to be given to students and so on some occasions are given the students and not we know that and she wanted it noted that knowing that students are are losing a day or two of schooling means that their likelihood of going to prison increases drastically by twenty six percent so she just wanted to say sort of in these past ten years what has been done and though her children have not really face those issues -- in terms of detention she had they have had to face comments from teachers -- speaking about how they compare go white students at the top previously for being disgusted by -- by her children in particular and so she just wanted to let voice those concerns and really say thank you to all the speakers here and for working on this issue and that she hopes that we can all continue to work on this issue moving forward as a matter of policy we're gonna work on the tension and it's been call continuation schools which is really a a -- continuation schools have led to the school to prison pipeline so I am very familiar with good afternoon my name is that passed the Calvin souls and to be here assemblymember and that the work that we've been able to do together -- I'm the and community health councils and -- we work -- specifically you know year and at three one any this community around the healthy kids zone -- which -- is an initiative that seeks to bring together leaders and community based organizations such as well m√† you know and other organizations around how to -- advocate for what needs to happen -- but he on campus for the students happen you know -- for this community within a half mile radius you know -- and to see how we can build it out you know I to facilitate community betterment and upliftment -- I really appreciate the -- positive energy you know -- around at promise -- as well as you know a school -- but -- to preserve the deportation -- because it it it provides us I think with the whole realistic you know approach as to how to move towards you know a bad of a community you know where strategies and solutions for students and for -- those who are in this community -- I want to specifically just lift up a couple of things one ease have assembly member you know -- I wanna I've talked with some of our members she and -- work that I've done you know in the west Adams community you know around freedom schools you know we've been able to utilize freedom schools as a direct strategy to a this rob and destroy the -- prison you know and so -- I don't know you know how you can there be resources you know -- allocated for that -- because I know one of the visions we have in this community is to try and see how we can facilitate something like that -- for the summertime I know this summer you know we've had a program here at Fremont are on a trip to New ship for young people as part of a violence prevention strategy you know -- which is what you know of freedom school is all about it is a national program it is in California you know you know in various communities you know through community coalition you know -- and how many that Mathis shows when I passed it you know around that so I don't know you know what how can we access some of those funny because that's a very very expensive program and also very very effective program you know in terms of -- how we can you know look you know all that and then the -- the other piece you know -- he's how can we continue you know -- to collaborate with you as you take all these legislative pieces in terms of board for you supporting you under getting you you know as you move you know these positive -- legislative pieces for because we know you know yourself by religion on and we are here to see how we can work and live with you you know around those pieces so are those are the two that I just well enough that you know around that thanks everyone thank you and just quickly week we may be close to it I just need to know it's not like we're we're full support of community schools in the commuter school concept I don't know the difference between freedom schools community schools and it the delta between the two may not be that far to where we do community schools and maybe just a little extra funding to get to communities to if we can sit and talk about the two concept with C. U. T. LA which you doing and then on as far legislation I just need people to to to write letters on at promises to the to the governor's desk as soon as possible you heard to retain a Butte their favourite a letter today so the sooner the better I also afternoon everyone thank you family member Jones Sawyer for doing this year leadership and everything else -- and freedom schools I believe are tomorrow from the children's defense fund that -- have you focus on literacy and started sort of the civil rights movement community schools are like wraparound school that a village that we know it takes the raise the child and there are definitely some synergy in some integration between them become a policy attorney with the ACLU of southern California Salih civil rights project and I've done work with them on this issue and I want to share a report I have copies that I provide for you as well because this year the largest reporter first report on a school based mental health -- it we looked at every school in the country off fifty million students know in probably her here in California were forty eighth in the nation when it comes to student access the counselors for every two hundred fifty students nationwide is one counts ready for Jim forty for students in California's one counts for almost every seven hundred students and we have some of that students face in the highest level the family separation and other forms of trauma adversity highs levels of homelessness hi number English learners and other things so what they sell you -- here specifically in LA -- we part of a lawsuit the cocoa will represent a community schools or committee coalition an effort to ensure that a high needs school receiving what they were entitled to on the lawn there el cap LCF at -- because the district were not originally given those funds to the students need because understate lawsuit schools with higher in his students low income high accented English learners foster you should receive more students -- but the schools were getting that originally but through the settlement -- they were able to hire additional psychiatric social workers and other things so it's not we know that funds are limited and -- schools don't have enough but there's also an issue here with this funds not be in place in prioritize where they are and that's a big part of the school to prison pipeline -- here in California one in this is in our report as well there several times as many police in schools and social workers it's almost by default that a school -- will have police here in LA U. S. the almost eighty million dollars a year on school police the largest school police force -- in the country and most girls don't have social workers this by default and there's by one social worker for every about two thousand students here as well so that's a big part of the school to prison pipeline we also saw that there several times many security guards in California schools and school nurses represented students who in southern California -- were placed on probation for reasons like grieving or other things that would have been addressed through the school based mental health professionals -- but instead they were placed through the school to prison pipeline in part because the school didn't have the proper staffing so they were probation offices there so they were placed on voluntary probation that I was the program here ended in LA county last school year -- that places students on voluntary probation as part of school to prison pipeline so what we see is the schools don't have the right resources and if something else then that's what ends up trapping them in the system -- and we also see here -- -- Dorsey that was mentioned earlier that the pepper spray incident that happened at Dorsey for the to incredibly -- when that happened a within an hour I got tax from teachers Instagram messages from students showing the incident number ten police on campus responding to and you saw some of them just sprained pepper spray indiscriminately something that is out of in band in juvenile facilities so think about that how can we can't spray pepper spray which is poison on ice right especially if the odds are still growing children is still development our schools but not in argue presence so that's something we we definitely need the challenge the California association school counselors national -- annual conference in riverside will work with them a present in there but we work with the other people service personnel to CalPERS office and school psychologists and others and sounds like they need to be a right to care at school this was a comment -- the California school nurse association noted that in almost half of schools might not have a a nurse school and if as we share earlier if many students are you receiving their care in school that means they don't have the right to care so we have a lot of oracle careless schools were students just don't have the right to access in here and as was mentioned are I think the president and as that forty percent of students in some of the enclaves are at risk for trauma -- more than war torn countries if we know that the need and we're not responding with the resources and responding with police and probation then that is the school to prison pipeline so again thank you for your leadership on this and I want to give you a copy of our report from my contact info and so Amir took a lot of what I was gonna say -- but I am going to reiterate some of the points that he made I think it's really important and again thank you probably the start first of all my name is Joseph Williams I'm I'm director of operation the campaigns with -- students deserve -- we're an organization that works with UCLA work with a CO you work with black lives matter the push for the into random searches in LA U. S. the schools I know -- superintendent you earlier said the LAUSD used to treat students like criminals right and we know that that's still happening right we know that at Dorothy high just a few weeks ago right students were indiscriminately pepper sprayed at Los Angeles high school last year black students were peppers right at this high school right Fremont high school two or three years ago there with the pepper spray incident were seventeen people I believe had to be sent to the hospital right this is a a practice that has been outlawed in our juvenile detention facilities but that school police are still using on a regular basis right primarily against black students right on so I think absolutely that's something that that needs to be addressed I hope that they're still folks from superintendent units office or the school board or you know whatever -- here to the to take back some of this stuff -- I think that's a huge issue right that pepper spray a chemical weapon is still allowed to be used against our students against are you right -- number two we talked again I think a number of folks today mentioned the the decline of -- suspensions after the elimination of will for the finance on the flip side of that has been a huge increase in arrests right I don't think that's talked about enough at all right we talk about the decline of suspensions and don't say what we're replacing them with were resting students instead of suspending students were sending students to the police right arm which again a huge factor in the school to prison pipeline -- especially black students there is a report released recently by million dollar -- the hoods project that you feel and I think Ryan was here earlier students are less than ten percent around eight percent of LA U. S. the schools but almost thirty percent of those who are referred to the school police right for either divergence for citations for rest almost thirty percent of those students who are sent to school police are black students even other less than ten percent of our schools right so again another thing that I think the district you know the school district as well as all the school district of in LA county and and and California need to address as well -- and then finally -- somebody mentioned that it doesn't cost to care right doesn't cost to care more absolutely but priorities right Amir mentioned LA U. S. -- LA U. S. the number one the LA school police department is the largest school police department in the entire country right number two even in spite of that we're still inviting LAPD LA county sheriffs and other police departments on four campuses even though we have our own school police department right as with mentioned that after this incident at Dorsey right ten to fifteen LAPD officers and also K. nine office the canine units were brought onto campus not just for that day but for the rest of the week right presence in our students right this is the all in one of the few majority black schools left in Los Angeles and this is how we respond to the youthful behavior right I got in fights when I was in school right when I was eighteen right so finally like I said that the budget for for LA school police department over eighty million dollars LA LA school -- LA unified has had a commitments of restorative justice now for almost five or ten years their annual expenditure on the restorative justice is five million dollars five million dollars for restorative justice over eighty million dollars for policing right so that shows you the priorities empower responding to student behavior to youth behavior right so I you know those three things like I said pepper spray is still being used on students arrested students are skyrocketing especially the rest of black students right and the the way that our priorities the district priorities right are are shown in our budget right where we're spending over eighty million dollars on school police a couple years ago there was a controversy on -- folks remember when they were trying to get a anti tank anti you know terror tank and they have their own anti terrorist apartment within the LA school police department right so these are the things literally that we're telling our students we look at you as criminals we look at U. S. terrace we look at you as a threat rather than as somebody who need services that somebody needs support right as somebody who's who's coming from a place of trauma in a place of really great need right so I definitely hope that you know again we can support you in in -- in the work that you're doing that we can continue to the up lift -- these issues that they can be addressed by the superintendent by L. U. S. the and other folks so again I want to thank everybody for being here today especially since it is a holiday in schools off but most important -- -- I've to me leave you with this one thing in my publisher said at the beginning about being careful about be careful who you talk to of a hundred and twenty people that make the Los four forty million Californians if you tell me seldom it might actually get done you did elect me about what I'm gonna do you elected me because I am going to do it so I promise you I will follow up and I will continue to do whatever I can to make sure my community south LA gets improved that's why I created this committee because this is an urgent call when I talk about -- state emergency four homeless Dave emergency for earthquakes determine what this is a state of emergency that we need to address right now and you have my full commitment and I'm glad to hear sometimes I feel alone I'm glad to hear it advocates and allies who want to help me continue this works I also thank you for for your support thank you in the select committee
