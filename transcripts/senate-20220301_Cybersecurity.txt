SO THAT WILL BEGIN OUR INFORMATIONAL OVERSIGHT HEARING THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CYBER SECURITY AND IDENTITY THEFT. PREVENTION SECOND INFORMATIONAL HEARING IN TODAY'S HEARING WILL DISCUSS ISSUES IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD. THEIR IMPACTS ON CONSUMERS PREVENTION AND RESPONSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE BOTH IN THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS. AND MOSTLY WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TO TRY TO DRILL DOWN ON WHAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE TO THE VEXING AND GROWING PROBLEM OF IDENTITY THEFT. ANY INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIC EXPERTS ON IT IN EIGHTY FIVE FOR PORT THAT IS NOT FRUITFUL TO ASK IF YOU'RE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WILL BE STOLEN BUT RATHER WHEN. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION RECEIVED NEARLY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION IDENTITY THEFT INCIDENT REPORTS. WHICH WAS UP FROM THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION RECEIVED THE YEAR PRIOR SCAMS ARE THE MOST COMMON WITH ONLINE SHOPPING MAKING UP THE SECOND MOST COMMON FORM OF IDENTITY THEFT. WHICH MAKES SENSE WITH THE INCREASING USE OF ONLINE CONSUMER MARKETS DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND THESE ATTACKS DO NOT COME WITHOUT A COST EVERYDAY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CONSUMERS REPORTED LOSING MORE THAN FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO FRAUD. INDICATING AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 70% FROM TWENTY TWENTY CONSUMERS WHO FILED A FRAUD REPORT THE FTC. REPORTED LOSING MONEY WHICH WAS UP FROM 23% TWENTY NINETEEN. THE FOCUS OF AN ANTI THEFT ATTACKED INDIVIDUAL TAX INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR LOVED ONES IS DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE. BECAUSE ONCE A PERSON'S IDENTIFYING INFORMATION STOLEN IT POSES A LONG TERM THREATS TO ONE'S ECONOMIC STANDING AND WHAT WELL BEING. THIS PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN BE USED TO APPLY FOR GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS BENEFITS LINES OF CREDIT OR MORE ANY POINT IN TIME. AS WE WELL KNOW THE BROAD EDT FRAUD THAT WE SAW ACROSS ALL FIFTY STATES OCCURRED IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE READY AVAILABILITY OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND OTHER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ON THE DARK WEB. I CAN TESTIFY PERSONALLY FOR THEM FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCES ABOUT BEING SOMEONE WHO IS FAMILIAR WITH IDENTITY THEFT. I'VE ACTUALLY HAD MY DATA BREACH THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS. AS PARTY EQUIFAX BREACH- OF UC IRVINE'S IN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S BREACH TO THE SALLY ON DATA BREACH. AND AS A CUSTOMER OF T. MOBILE I'M NOW AWARE THAT MY INFORMATION AND INFORMATION I THREE YOUNG CHILDREN IS ACTUALLY ON THE DARK WEB IN WE PERIODICALLY GET REPORTS ABOUT THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I'LL HAVE TO DO WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE MORE UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING THAT MY CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. AND I'M INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT IS SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND SO IT'S A TIME IT'S TIME THAT WE START COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS. LUCKILY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXPERTS IN THE PRIVATE PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC SECTORS WHO WORK HARD EACH DAY TO. BOTH CREATE SOLUTIONS THESE PROBLEMS. AND SPREAD AWARENESS ABOUT THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS. TODAY WE'RE JOINED BY FEW THESE EXPERTS. WHO WANT TO DISCUSS HOW TO SUPPORT. AND COORDINATE THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S IDENTITY. OUR FIRST PANEL WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE TYPES OF IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD OCCUR AS WELL SHARE THE IMPACT IT HAS ON CONSUMERS. WILL HAVE ERIC ALMONDS THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND CONSUMER DATA IDENTITY ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK FIRST. AND HE WILL BE JOINED BY EVA VELASQUEZ- THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CENTER. THAT PANEL THEM EVOLVE OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH WILL DISCUSS ANY THEFT PREVENTION RESPONSE AND ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. JOINING US ON THAT PANEL WILL BE TO TREVINO AUSTIN CALIFORNIA'S DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND CHAIRMAN GRANT MANAGING DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS STRATEGY AND VENABLE LLP. AFTER THE CONCLUSION BOTH PANELS I'LL OPEN UP THE DISCUSSION AND QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM OUR MEMBERS. BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP TO THE PUBLIC TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN ADJOURNED THE HEARING. THE GOAL FOR TODAY'S HERE ABOUT EMERGING IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD DANGERS THAT WE ALL FACE DAILY. WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS TO COMBAT IDENTITY THEFT AND HOW WE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE CONSISTENT PROVIDING SOLUTIONS. I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR JOINING US TODAY. AND I THAT WOULD OPEN UP THIS OPPORTUNITY MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS THEY LIKE TO SHARE AT THIS TIME. CENTER NUMBER. THANK YOU CENTERMAN THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE TOO I THINK ALL CALIFORNIANS- JUST VERY BRIEFLY. IN YESTERDAY'S PAPERS WE NOTE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LEAK OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA FROM THE STATE BAR TWO. HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS THAT WERE LEAKED THIS WASN'T. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MOST BECAUSE OF PACKING IT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SEARCH ENGINE SOMEHOW- FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR SO THE QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF PROTECTION. HOW ADEQUATELY PROTECTED ARE WE ARE WE PROTECTED NOT JUST THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR FOR WHICH WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND SO AS WE EXPLORE THIS TOPIC- MISTER CHAIR I AM HOPEFUL THAT THAT WE ALSO CAN IF NOT TODAY IN IN FUTURE HEARINGS. WE CAN EXPLORE THE ADEQUACY OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AFFORDED- CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS. OUT WITH WITH WHICH WE'VE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO KEEP CONFIDENTIAL THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR- CENTER ON YOUR COMMENTS. JUST IMMENSELY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO GET WORSE GIVEN THAT CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL- EVENTS AND I WAS ONE ALSO I WANT TO THANK AND APPLAUD THE CHAIR FOR TAKING ON A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS AREA- FOR GETTING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE GOING. I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP YOUR SENTIMENT. AND YOU TURN AROUND AND THE CENTRE BORDERS IS JOINING US YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS YOU LIKE TO ADD OKAY FANTASTIC THANKS FOR JOINING US ON OUR BORDERS AND I WOULD JUST SAY I JUST TOOK THE CALIFORNIA BAR EXAM SO WELL I'M I'M GLAD THAT MY INFORMATION I THINK WAS NOT PART OF THAT WEEK BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO THE PROBLEM HERE THAT WE SEE ACROSS BOTH THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS. BEFORE YOU GO WITH OUR SPEAKERS I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WAITING TO WANTING TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW PLEASE DIAL AGAIN THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER. 844-291-6364 AND WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THIS ACCESS CODE SEVEN SIX NINE. SEVEN ONE EIGHT EIGHT HOW'S YOUR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER ERIC ALLMAN THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND CONSUMER DATA. IDENTITY ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M ERIC ELEMENT WITH THE CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION CTIA WE OUR TRADE ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AS DEFINED BY. FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. OUR MEMBERS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED COMPANIES THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS. GATHER STORE AND USE PROTECTED DATA TO HELP BUSINESSES. GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFITS MANAGE RISK. I WANT TO THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR WITH YOU. TODAY TO PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I CAN TO HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW IDENTITY THEFT IS PREVENTED. AND REMEDIATED. BY OUR MEMBERS. I WANT TO CONVEY TO YOU SEVERAL POINTS. CBI MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE STEWARDS OF THE DATA THAT THEY MAINTAIN IN PART BECAUSE OF THE IT'S THE LAW. IN PART BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. CTIA MEMBERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. IN THE MANAGEMENT AND IDENTIFICATION OF. THE BANISHMENT THE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION. TO MAKE A SHORT AS POSSIBLE THE BUSINESSES GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFITS. ARE DOING BUSINESS WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE. THERE ARE LAWS IN PLACE AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AND NATIONWIDE- BUT THERE'S ONE BILL IN PARTICULAR TWELVE SENATE BILL TWELVE SIXTY TWO BY YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR BRADFORD. THAT CAN GO A LONG WAY TO PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS WHERE THEY LIVE. AND WHERE THEY WORK. IDENTITY THEFT IS A PROBLEM. IT WAS A PROBLEM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC THIS IS BEEN ESPECIALLY TRUE AGAINST GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GOVERNMENT BENEFITS LIKE SNAP. UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION- AND OTHERS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR HASN'T BEEN IMPACTED AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE SHARING HITCHCOCK RECENTLY TOLD THE F. T. C. A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT BUT HER PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS STOLEN AND THAT SOMEONE HAD SIGNED UP FOR UNEMPLOYMENT COMP IN HER NAME SHE HAD ONE DEPOSITS INTO HER BANK ACCOUNT WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME ON IT. AND SHE WAS HIT WITH A TEN NINETY NINE G. FROM THE IRS FOR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. I RETURN TO A SEMINAL COMMENT MADE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING IN DECEMBER TWENTY OH ONE. WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO NOTED THAT AT LEAST SEVEN OF THE NINE ELEVEN HIJACKERS OBTAINED VIRGINIA STATE IDENTITY CARDS. TO BOARD PLANES EVEN THOUGH THEY LIVED IN MARYLAND AT MOTELS SAID IF WE CAN BE SURE WE'RE INTERACTING WITH THE RIGHT PERSON. THEN THE PERSON THAT THEY PURPORT TO BE. AND WHERE ARE WE- THE DATA MATCHING IS KEY ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT IS THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF INFORMATION TO TELL ONE PERSON FROM ANOTHER PERSON. REMEMBER THAT OLD NEW YORKER CARTOON ON THE INTERNET NO ONE KNOWS YOU'RE A DOG. THAT STILL APPLIES TODAY SO HOW DO WE DO THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY AND AUTHENTICATE PEOPLE. IS DATA AVAILABILITY AND DATA MATCHING AND MORE OF IT. IN JANUARY TWENTY OH ONE- IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GAO CONCLUDED. THAT IN MANY CASES FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE A NUMBER OF INCOME DEPENDENT BENEFIT PROGRAMS LIKE ENERGY ASSISTANCE. AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE MAYBE MISSING OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ENHANCE THEIR VERIFICATION TOOLS. DATA VERIFICATION CAN ENABLE PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL FRAUD. OR IMPOSTER PAYMENTS. AND IN A JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO PRESS RELEASE FROM THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES. A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT. FOR ITS FAILURE TO CROSS CHECK OUT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S DEATH MASTER FILE TO MAKE SURE THE DENTIST BENEFITS ARE GOING TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE. NOW LET ME SPEND A MOMENT TALKING ABOUT THE LOCK. FEDERAL AND STATE LAW IMPOSES ON CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES OUR MEMBERS A NUMBER OF OBLIGATIONS AND EMPOWERS CONSUMERS WITH A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT RIGHTS TO PROTECT THEIR INFORMATION. CREDIT FREEZES CREDIT FREEZES FOR MINERS TRADE LINE BLOCKING WHERE CONSUMERS WITH AN ID THEFT REPORT CAN BLOCK FROM APPEARING ON A CREDIT REPORT ITEMS THAT WERE COMPROMISED BY FRAUD. FRAUD ALERTS FOR ALL CONSUMERS ACTIVE DUTY ALERTS AND CREDIT REPORTS FOR OUR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TRYING KISHAN CREDIT REPORTS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NUMBER TRUNCATION. ESTABLISHMENT OF RED FLAG GUIDELINES WHERE THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES AND LENDERS AND CREDITORS MUST ESTABLISH GUIDELINES TO PROTECT PREVENT AND DETECT- TO DETECT IDENTITY THEFT PATTERNS AND PREVENT THEM. COMPLAIN COORDINATION THE FTC AND THE NATIONAL CREDIT BUREAUS HAVE MUST HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE AND THEY DO HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO COORDINATE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. THERE'S A PREVENTION OF A PROPOSED A PROVISION IN FEDERAL LAW WHERE COMPANIES TO FURNISH DATA TO CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AGAIN OUR MEMBERS HAVE TO DEVELOP PRISSY PROCEDURES TO PREVENT. THE REAPPEARANCE OF DATA THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF FRAUD DEBT COLLECTION LIMITS FOR DEBT RESULTING IN FRAUD STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXCEPTIONS ENHANCED OPT OUT FOR PRE APPROVED CREDIT CARD AND INSURANCE OFFICERS. DISPOSAL OF RECORDS THAT CONSUMER REPORTING INFORMATION MUST BE DISPOSED OF AND I'M MANNER SET BY FEDERAL REGULATION. ADDRESS RECONCILIATION WORK CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES MUST NOTIFY USERS OF CONSUMER REPORTS. ABOUT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT ADDRESSES BETWEEN AN ADDRESS ON FILE AND AN ADDRESS FROM AN APPLICANT- THOSE ARE JUST A NUMBER OF- OF TOOLS USED TO CHAIR. XI TI MEMBERS. HAVE TOOLS LIKE I SAID FOR CONSUMERS ARE VOLUNTARY INITIATIVES AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ALL COMBINE TO HELP PROTECT AND PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT THERE'S STILL MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND OUR MEMBERS ARE WORKING HARD ON THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THERE'S MORE THAT COULD BE DONE AS WELL LIKE I SAID YEAH- TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IN THE FORM OF SENATE BILL TWELVE SIXTY TWO BY SENATOR BRADFORD WHICH CAN ALSO HELP CONSUMERS WHERE THEY LIVE. AND WHERE THEY WORK TO HELP KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE EVERYWHERE WE GO SO WITH THAT- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WILL PAUSE AND I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I NEXT WE HEAR FROM EVA VELASQUEZ THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CENTER WELCOME IS ALASKA'S. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF SPEAKING WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS EVA VELASQUEZ AND I'M THE CEO OF THE NONPROFIT IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CENTER BASED IN SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WE'VE PROVIDED FREE SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF IDENTITY CRIMES IN FACT LAST YEAR OUR CONTACT CENTER ASSISTED FIFTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS TO EITHER RECOVER THEIR IDENTITIES OR PREPARE FOR THE DAY WHEN THEIR IDENTITIES ARE REQUIRED OR MISUSED. AND WE ASSISTED AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION PEOPLE THROUGH OUR WEBSITE NOW REACH PROGRAMS ALL AT NO COST TO THEM UP SOME CONFUSION AROUND IDENTITY THEFT VERSUS IDENTITY FRAUD. IDENTITY THEFT OCCURS WHEN OUR IDENTITY CREDENTIALS AND ARE PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ARE COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY SOMETIMES IT'S THROUGH SELF COMPROMISE WHEN WE SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE IT MAYBE IT'S THROUGH A PHISHING EMAIL OR A SCAM PHONE CALL. OR IT CAN BE COMPROMISED YOUR DATA BREACH. THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO DATA BREACHES LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE HIGHEST NUMBER WE'VE RECORDED SINCE WE STARTED TRACKING THESE EVENTS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. AND IT'S THE STUFF OF OUR DATA THAT'S FUELING THE IDENTITY FRAUD EPIDEMIC. IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD OCCURS AND ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED FINANCIAL. AND GOVERNMENT BUT YOUR IDENTITY CANNOT ONLY BE USED TO TAKE OUT LOANS AND OR CREDIT CARDS OR TO APPLY FOR GOVERNMENT BENEFITS AND SERVICES THAT CAN ALSO BE USED DURING THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME. OR EVEN FOR MEDICAL GOODS AND SERVICES THINGS LIKE A PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SH AND ADDITIONALLY IDENTITY FRAUD CAN CO OCCUR WITH OTHER CRIME TYPES. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE A DOMESTIC ABUSERS AND HUMAN TRAFFIC PERSONAL USE IDENTITY CREDENTIALS OF THEIR VICTIMS TO EITHER FURTHER CONTROL THEM OR TO FURTHER FUND THEIR OTHER CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES. ACCORDING TO THE FTC TWENTY TWENTY ONE CONSUMER SENTINEL NETWORK DATA BOOK IDENTITY THEFT WAS THE NUMBER ONE TYPE OF FRAUD COMPLAINTS IN THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SH IDENTITY FRAUD OR IDENTITY RELATED. FRAUD COMPLAINTS ACCOUNTED 425% OF ALL THE FRAUD COMPLAINTS IN THE STATE. AND ACCORDING TO PRIVATE RESEARCH ENTITIES THOUGH THOSE ANNUAL NATIONAL NUMBERS ARE MUCH HIGHER OFTEN IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF VICTIMS ANNUALLY WITH THE LOSSES IN TWENTY TWENTY ESTIMATED. TO BE AT FIFTY SIX BILLION. BUT IF WE ONLY. THE DOLLAR LOSSES WE FAIL TO SEE THE FULL IMPACT IMPACT OF IDENTITY CRIMES THERE'S OFTEN THIS CASCADING EFFECT THAT IMPACTS ALL FACETS OF THE VICTIM'S LIFE. AND THERE ARE A MOTIONAL THE PHYSICAL EVEN LOST OPPORTUNITY COSTS THAT COSTS THAT WE DON'T OFTEN CONSIDER. SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE THE I. KERR SEES BUT MEASURING THESE IMPACTS ON OUR AFTERMATH REPORTS. THIS IS A SURVEY WHERE WE TALK TO THE VICTIMS THAT WE ASSISTED IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND WE ASK THEM THESE QUESTIONS. IN OUR REPORT ISSUED LAST YEAR 84% OF PRE PANDEMIC VICTIMS REPORTED FEELING ANXIOUS AND WORRIED. 76% FELT VIOLATED. AND A FULL 10% HAD SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. SINCE THE PANDEMIC 40% OF OUR RESPONDENTS STATED THEY WERE UNABLE TO PAY THEIR ROUTINE BILLS 33% DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR FOOD OR UTILITIES FOR BASIC NECESSITIES. AND 13% OF OUR RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET A TEMPORARY OR TEMPORARY OR A PERMANENT JOB AS A RESULT OF AN IDENTITY MISUSE. VICTIMS OFTEN EQUATE THEIR EXPERIENCE- BUT- LIKE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS WHERE IT CAN GO INTO REMISSION BUT IT'S NEVER FULLY CARED BECAUSE OUR RECOVERY PROCESSES ARE SO INCONSISTENT THEY'RE CONFUSING AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE EVEN AN ACCESSIBLE. THEY THEY JUST AREN'T UNIFORM. EVERY ENTITY WHERE IDENTITY FRAUD CANON DOES OCCUR FROM BANKS TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO MEDICAL PROVIDERS HAS A DIFFERENT PROCESS THAT THE VICTIMS MUST BE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT IT MUST EXECUTE ON. ANY OF NUMEROUS SYSTEMS ARE LEVERAGED TO COMMIT THE CRIME THE VICTIM MUST RESOLVE THAT ISSUE WITH EACH AND EVERY ENTITY INDIVIDUALLY. IT'S UNREASONABLE FOR US TO EXPECT VICTIMS TO KNOW HOW TO PRIORITIZE AND CONTACT EACH ORGANIZATION ON THEIR OWN OUR OUR RECOVERY AND RISK MINIMIZATION SERVICES FOR VICTIMS ARE NOT APPROPRIATELY PRIORITIZED. DESPITE THE GROWING VOLUME OF IDENTITY CRIMES AND THE INCREASE IN RESOURCES DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF CYBER CRIMES WHICH IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. THERE IS NO SIMILAR EFFORT UNDER WAY TO SUPPORT THE ACTUAL VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES. PAID SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE BUT MANY PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE OUT OF REACH FOR MANY FOLKS IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC SO FREE ASSISTANCE IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR VICTIMS. AND THERE ARE ONLY TWO NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE THAT FREE DIRECT ASSISTANCE THAT'S THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE IDENTITY THEFT RESOURCE CENTER. ABOUT REPORTS THAT I REFERENCED- AFTERMATH REPORT THE DATA BREACH NUMBERS- ALL OF THESE ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS ALL OF OUR RECOVERY ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENTS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU MS ALASKA'S FOR SHARING YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE EXPERTISE. WHEN I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT PANEL PICK BACK UP WITH THE MR RAHMAN IN MIS ALASKA'S- AT THE CLOSE OF THIS HEARING DURING QUESTION ANSWER- PANEL TO DISCUSS IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION RESPONSE AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. WILL NOW BEGIN WITH. A WITH A FIRST I'D LIKE TO WELCOME TANYA AUSTIN CALIFORNIA DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL I THANK YOU MISS US AND SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. IT'S MY PLEASURE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I'M A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND A LINE PROSECUTOR WHO HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE STATE FOR TWENTY PLUS YEARS. AND FOR BETTER OR WORSE I'VE BEEN WORKING AND WHAT I CALL PRIVACY VIOLATION CRIMES FOR THAT TWENTY YEARS- WE OUGHT TO USE THE TERM IDENTITY THEFT AS A CATCH ALL. BUT I. WHEN I WAS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH- THEN GENERAL HARRIS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD DISCUSS WAS OFTEN HOW WORDS CAN MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE AND THAT WAS WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IDENTITY THEFT. AND HOW IT IMPACTED REVENGE PORN. BUT MOVING ON TO- FOCUSING ON PRIVACY VIOLATIONS FROM A CRIMINAL PERSPECTIVE- BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A UNIT CALLED THE U. CRIMES UNIT WHICH IS A VERY SPECIAL- SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION UNIT THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH SUBJECT MATTER MATTER EXPERTS SUCH AS MYSELF WHO SPECIALIZE IN THE PROSECUTION OF ALL TYPES OF IDENTITY THEFT CRIMES. AND AS I SAID WE COVER THE ENTIRE STATE AT THERE'S ONLY SIX OF US. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT- WERE SMALL BUT MIGHTY. AND WE DO OUR VERY BEST TO WORK ON COMPLEX- MULTI JURISDICTIONAL IDENTITY THEFT CASES. AS WELL AS THE CYBER CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE INTERTWINED WITH THEM. I IN CONJUNCTION WEST OF THE REGIONAL HIGH TAX IDENTITY THEFT TASK FORCES THAT WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH ARE RUN BY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN SAN DIEGO WHERE I'M LOCATED- WE HAVE TO CATCH I AM ABSOLUTELY SURE- MISSED ALASKA'S IS FAMILIAR WITH WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT IS OUR LOCAL REGIONAL TASK FORCE. THAT WORKS TO BRING UP MULTIPLE AGENCIES TOGETHER IN CONJUNCTION. WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. TO TRY TRIP TO TRY TO ATTACK YOU KNOW STREAM PRICE. AND WHEN I CAN SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS THAT OVER THE YEARS AS A STREET LEVEL OR NOT IS A STREET LEVEL BUT A LINE LEVEL PROSECUTING TANK IS THAT WHEN I STARTED IN THE WORLD OF PROSECUTING IDENTITY THEFT- I WOULD INVEST QUITE A BIT OF TIME WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY. TRYING TO EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS ON HOW TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY AND MISTER CHAIR YOU REALLY NAILED IT WHEN YOU EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT NOW IN THIS DAY AND AGE IT'S MORE ABOUT WHAT TO DO AFTER YOUR IDENTITY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN FISHED OUT OF THE WAY OUR SITE FOR USE I BET I WOULD SAY OVERWHELMINGLY. BASED ON MY PRACTICAL AND ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE- EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL I KNOW HAS HAD THEIR IDENTITY COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER. AND SO IT'S LESS ABOUT PREVENTING WELL NOT NOT TO GIVE UP HOPE. BUT IT'S MORE ABOUT HOW DO WE HELP OUR CITIZENS WHEN. THEY HAVE BEEN PLUCKED FROM THE PILE IN THE MIDDLE MILLIONS OF IDENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN OR COMPROMISED. FOR A CRIMINAL. VIOLATE AND USED TO GET MONEY WHICH IS OVERWHELMINGLY THE ENTIRE PURPOSE BEHIND ALL FORMS OF IDENTITY THEFT. WHEN I STARTED I WAS TRADITIONALLY PROSECUTING INDIVIDUALS WHO UNFORTUNATELY I SUFFERED FROM VARIOUS ADDICTIONS STALL INDIVIDUALS- MAILS OUT MAIL OUT OF THEIR MAILBOXES- AND DID WHAT WE CALLED CUTTING CHECKS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. TO ESSENTIALLY STEAL WHAT MIGHT BE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS RELATED. TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY. THE CLASSIC CASE I NOW CHRIST. AND BY CLASSIC I MEAN COMMENT IT IS A VERY SIMILAR TO THE STUDENT LOAN FRAUD CASE THAT WE JUST- COMPLETED A GRAND JURY ON IN ORANGE COUNTY- WHEREIN VARIOUS BOILER ROOMS ARE USING SOCIAL ENGINEERING. TO TRICK CITIZENS INTO PROVIDING THEIR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR STUDENT LOANS. AND MANIPULATE THOSE LOANS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND STEAL MONEY FROM THE STUDENT BORROWERS TO THE TUNE OF WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE VICTIM'S DATA DAYS OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND VICTIMS. THAT'S ONE VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE THAT SET US SEVEN CODEFENDANT CRIMINAL CASE NOW ACTIVE IN IN SANTA ANA YOU KNOW IN ORANGE COUNTY- WHERE- TRYING TO MANAGE THESE VERY VERY COMPLEX IDENTITY THEFT SCHEMES. THAT INVOLVED THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS WERE OFTEN TIMES THE GOAL IS TO STEAL SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S VERY VERY EASY TO DO WITH OUR INTERNET AGE WORLD. IS WHITE POINTS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE- RESOURCE STRAIN ON YOUR JUST YOUR GENERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TEAM AND PROSECUTORS. THERE WAS A TIME YEARS AGO WHEN I WOULD CITE THE STATISTIC WHERE IN I WOULD SHARE WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY MAN HOURS TO INVESTIGATE YOUR AVERAGE HOMICIDE. OKAY NOW AGAIN THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS AN AVERAGE HOMICIDE BUT MY POINT BEING THAT AT THE TIME PUTTING TOGETHER AN AVERAGE IDENTITY THEFT INVESTIGATION WAS BEING CLOCKED AT TWO HUNDRED ONE FOR SEVEN HOURS. SO PUTTING THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND LOOKING AT HOW THAT IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY KIND OF STOP CRIME ON THE STREET SPECIALLY WHEN IT'S RISEN TO THIS LEVEL OF EXTREME SOPHISTICATION. SHOWS THAT- YOU KNOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TRYING TO BRING TO BEAR THE SOPHISTICATION TO MANAGE THOSE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS. IS OFTEN CAN HONORED BY THE OVERALL. STRUGGLE OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES AGAIN AS I MISSED THE LAST HAS COMMENTED IN EVEN JUST ASSISTING OUR VICTIMS ON A CASE SO- WITH THAT I ALWAYS SERVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTARY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND- WHAT TYPES OF TOOLS WERE USING AND WHAT TYPES OF TOLS WE CAN USE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD I'M TRYING TO COMBAT THIS VERY INSIDIOUS A CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS AUSTIN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR YOUR WORK ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR RESIDENTS. LAST BUT NOT LEAST CERTAINLY WILL HEAR FROM GERMANY GRANT THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS STRATEGY AT VENABLE L. L. P. MR GRANT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. RIGHT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN HERE IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT I THOUGHT IT HIGHLIGHTED A CRITICAL QUESTION THAT DOES NOT GET ENOUGH ATTENTION IN THESE DISCUSSIONS WHICH IS. KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW. WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO BUILD SECURITY SYSTEMS WITH THE OUTDATED ASSUMPTION THAT HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF Y IDENTITY INFORMATION MEANS I'M SOMEHOW THAT PERSON. MY NAME'S JEREMY GRANTHAM MANAGING DIRECTOR IN THE CYBER SECURITY PRACTICE AVAILABLE I'M BASED OUT OF WASHINGTON DC. CREDIBLE ALSO HAS A BIG PRESENCE IN BOTH LA AND SAN FRANCISCO. AS BACKGROUND I'VE WORKED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS ACROSS BOTH INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT AT THE INTERSECTION OF IDENTITY AND SECURITY. INCLUDING SEVERAL YEARS LEADING THE TRUSTED IDENTITIES GROUP THAT NASTY NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY. AS PART OF MY ROLE IN VENABLE I LEAD AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE BETTER IDENTITY COALITION WAS LAUNCHED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THE WAKE OF MASSIVE. TAX BREACH IT'S BEEN FOCUSED ON BRINGING TOGETHER LEADING FIRMS FROM DIFFERENT SECTORS TO WORK WITH POLICYMAKERS TO IMPROVE THE WAY THAT AMERICANS ESTABLISH AND PROTECT AND VERIFY THEIR IDENTITIES WHEN THEY'RE ONLINE. OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE RECOGNIZED LEADERS FROM FIRMS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES TELECOM HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY INTACT INSURANCE PAYMENTS AND SECURITY RE TWENTY SEVEN MEMBERS ARE UNITED BY A COMMON RECOGNITION. BUT THE WAY WE HANDLE IDENTITY TODAY IN THE U. S. IS BROKEN. BY COMMON DESIRE TO SEE BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS EACH TAKES STEP TO MAKE STEPS MAKE IDENTITY SYSTEMS WORK BETTER. UP FRONT I WANT TO SAY THE WAY WE HANDLE IDENTITY IN THIS COUNTRY IMPACTS OUR SECURITY OUR PRIVACY AND OUR LIBERTY FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT PARTICULARS WERE LOOKING TO MOVE MORE HIGH VALUE TRANSACTIONS INTO THE DIGITAL WORLD. IDENTITY CAN BE THE GREAT ENABLER PROVIDING THE FOUNDATION FOR DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS AND ONLINE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE MORE SECURE. MORE ENJOYABLE FOR THE USER AND IDEALLY MORE RESPECTFUL OF THEIR PRIVACY. WHEN WE DON'T GET IDENTITY RIGHT WE NEED A LIST OF GREAT ATTACK POINTS FOR CRIMINALS AND OTHER ADVERSARIES. A WHOPPING 81% OF CYBER SECURITY ATTACKS ARE EXECUTED BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WEAK OR STOLEN PASSWORDS. 81% SAID ENORMOUS NUMBER IT MEANS IT IS AN ANOMALY. WHEN A BREACH. HE HAS NOT PROVIDED EXPECTED. DON'T OF PASSWORDS WHICH ADVERSE STICKY JUST TELL ME DATA SETS OF A- IN LARGE PARTS EVEN EASIER TIME COMPROMISING THE ID VERIFICATION SERVICES TO BUSINESSES PUT IN PLACE THE BEST APPLICANTS FOR NEW CREDIT CARDS OR OTHER SERVICES IN WHICH GOVERNMENTS LIKE CALIFORNIA USED ABOUT APPLICANTS FOR STATE ADMINISTERED BENEFITS PROGRAMS SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. I KNOW THIS LAST AREAS GOTTEN QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION CALIFORNIA PAST YEAR WITH REPORTS THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PAID OUT TO CRIMINALS POLICE NOT POSING AS CALIFORNIANS. OUTSIDE OF FOR OTHER STORIES ON THE FLIP SIDE OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THEY NEED AND RIGHTFULLY DESERVE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PROVE THEY ARE ONLINE AND IN SOME CASES THE SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE ARE NOW GETTING THE TEN NINETY NINE G. TAX FORMS ABOUT TAXES OBEY ON BENEFITS OF CRIMINAL CLAIM BEFORE. THEM WHICH IS JUST ADDING INSULT TO INJURY. THE SAME SERIES EVENTS. HAS BEEN REPEATED IN DOZENS OF STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THESE PAST FEW YEARS. AS ORGANIZED CRIMINALS RACE TO EXPLOIT WEAK ID VERIFICATION SYSTEMS TO STEAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING. WELL I THINK A KEY TAKEAWAY FOR THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND TODAY'S THE ATTACKERS HAVE JUST. FLAT OUT CAUGHT UP WITH A LOT OF THE FIRST GENERATION TOOLS WE'VE USED TO PROTECT. AND VERIFY AND AUTHENTICATE IDENTITY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR THIS AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF BLAME TO ALLOCATE BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS. WHAT SHOULD GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY DO ABOUT IT NOW. THAT'S A KEY POINT TO GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE I'D LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE AWAY FROM TODAY'S HEARING. IS THAT INDUSTRY IS SAYING THEY CAN'T SOLVE THIS ALONE. AWARDED JUNCTURE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO NEED TO STEP UP AND PLAY A BIGGER ROLE. TO HELP ADDRESS CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IN OUR DIGITAL IDENTITIES FABRIC. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO BETTER IDENTITY COALITION PUBLISHED WILL BE CALLED OUR POLICY BLUEPRINTS WHICH OUTLINED. A SET OF KEY INITIATIVES THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LAUNCH TO IMPROVE IDENTITY THAT ARE BOTH MEANINGFUL IMPACT AND- WE THINK PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTS. NOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT A NATIONAL ID WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING THE ONE BE CREATED. OUR THESIS IS REALLY THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AUTHORITATIVE GOVERNMENTS AND IDENTITY SYSTEMS ALREADY TODAY. THE DRIVER'S LICENSE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR PASSPORT THE SSNS. ARE CHALLENGERS WHAT I CALL THE IDENTITY GAP. WHICH IS ALL THE SYSTEMS ARE STUCK OVER THE PAPER WORLD WHILE. COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY MOVING ONLINE. SO TO FIX THIS AMERICA'S. BASE. ASK AN AGENCY. THAT ALREADY ISSUED THEM A CREDENTIAL TO STAND BEHIND IT IN THE ONLINE WORLD BY VALIDATING THE INFORMATION FROM THAT CREDENTIAL. HERE'S WHERE STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA CAN PLAY A ROLE. BY SHIFTING FROM ISSUING DRIVER'S LICENSES AND STATE ID EAST THAT ARE JUST PLASTIC CARDS. BUT ALSO DOUBLE AS ROBUST DIGITAL CREDENTIALS SAY BY LETTING CONSUMERS CHOOSE TO STORE DIGITAL VERSION OF THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR SMART PHONE. WE FUNDED THE VERY FIRST PILOTS OF THESE NEW MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSES BACK WHEN I WAS A FINISHED IN TWENTY TWELVE. TODAY A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE EMBRACED HIM AS THE BEST WAY TO EXTEND THE TRUST MODEL OF THE STATE DRIVER'S LICENSE TO THE ONLINE WORLD. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE ENTITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN MY VIEW PUBLIC OR PRIVATE THAT'S BETTER SUITED TO HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN THE DMV. IF CALIFORNIA HAD A MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE PROGRAM IN PLACE AT THE START OF A PANDEMIC. STATE OFFICIALS COULD LEVERAGE THE MILLIONS OF STATE BACKED IDENTITY PROOFING PROCESS THESE. CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THIS DMV OFFICES TO VALIDATE. THE IDENTITIES OF APPLICANTS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. NOW TO BE CLEAR THAT MEANS MOST APPLICANTS ARE NOT ALL. THE DRIVER'S LICENSE MIGHT BE THE MOST COMMONLY HELD EXPOSURE- HIGH ASSURANCE IDENTITY CREDENTIAL IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ADULTS IN THE STATES YOU DON'T HAVE ONE. AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL WANT TO STATE ISSUED APP ON A SMARTPHONE OR ONE ON A SMARTPHONE. SO MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IT CAN'T BE THE ONLY SOLUTION OTHERWISE SHOULD BE EXCLUDING A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM ACCESS TO SERVICES. SHOWS A STARTING POINT I THINK IT'S THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA FOCUS. ALSO HELP TO SHIFT US BEYOND OUTDATED SYSTEMS THAT REMIND IDENTIFIERS LIKE THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER WHICH HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. SO FREQUENTLY THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE ANY SECURITY VALUE AT ALL. THE IDEA THAT SIMPLY KNOWING SOMEBODY'S SSN IS EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE THAT PERSON IS WILDLY UPDATE. THE REALITY IS MOST SSNS HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED IN ONE OR MORE DATA BREACHES OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. SO BOTH INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE BUILDING SYSTEMS. THAT ASSUME. SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT ASSUME THAT SYSTEMS ARE SECRET. OR HAVE ANY SECURITY VALUE BECAUSE TODAY THEY DON'T. KNOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE SS AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AND IDENTITY. AT THE END OF THE DAY I DIE AS THE ASSISTANT AS AN IDENTIFIER AWAY FOR EXAMPLE TO HELP SOMEONE DETERMINED IF. SOMEBODY NAMED JEREMY GRANT IS APPLYING FOR AN ACCOUNT. AND THERE'S MAYBE THREE HUNDRED GERMAN GRANTS THAT THEY CAN SEE IN THE SYSTEM WELL. WHICH JEREMY GRANTED SEE ONLY ONE. HOPEFULLY AS MY ASSISTANT. I DON'T NEED TO BE SECRET THE FACT OTHER COMMONLY USED IDENTIFIERS LIKE PHONE NUMBERS AND EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE NOT. BUT WE SOMEHOW BECOME FIXATED AS A COUNTRY AND THE CONCEPT OF THE ASSISTANT CAN AND SHOULD BE A SECRET. AND CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR SEASON SECURITY EFFORTS. AROUND WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE BECOMING OUTDATED CONCEPT. RATHER THAN FOCUS ON NEWER INITIATIVES THAT MIGHT BETTER PROTECT AMERICANS IN THE SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF THEIR DATA. SO WITH ALL THIS IN MIND I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THE SENATE HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER GRANT. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND- I BEFORE I MOVE ON TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I DID WANT TO AGAIN INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PARTICIPATE THE CALL IN NOW. PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER. 844-291-6364 AND WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THIS ACCESS CODE. SEVEN SIX NINE SEVEN ONE EIGHT EIGHT. WELL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS THIS- I'LL OPEN UP A FEW QUESTIONS FOR OUR FIRST PANEL- THEN I'LL MOVE IT TO MY COLLEAGUES- IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR EITHER ANY OF THE PANELISTS- AND THEN I WILL RETURN BACK TO THE PANEL TO- WE CAN THEN TAKE IT BACK TO THE PANEL- THE MEMBERS IF THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THAT POINT- GOING BACK TO MR ELMAN AND MISS ALASKA'S. I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU IS JUST TO GET A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM- YOU KNOW WE HAVE- WE DO HAVE SOME ANECDOTES HERE AROUND- THE SCALE OF IDENTITY THEFT AND IDENTITY FRAUD- YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM MISTER GRANT THAT HE THINKS AT THIS POINT MOST PEOPLE HAD THEIR ASSETS AND- BREACHED IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER- DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A SENSE OF. HOW BIG A PROBLEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT THIS POINT. WELL I WOULD YIELD TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER LAST CHRISTMAS- WHO MAY HAVE CLOSER FAMILIARITY WITH THOSE NUMBERS AND WE DO- YES WE DO HAVE DATA ON PARTICULARLY ON DATA BREACHES THE I. TERZI HAS BEEN CAPTURING A PUBLICLY REPORTED. INCIDENTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND WE DO ISSUE A REPORT ON THAT- WE CAPTURE THE NUMBER NOT ONLY OF INCIDENTS THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO BACK IN- LAST YEAR. A BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS NOT THE NUMBER OF RECORDS THOSE ARE IN THE TRILLIONS BUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE IMPACTED I CAN LOOK THAT NUMBER UP I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME AT THE MOMENT BUT IT HAS BEEN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF VICTIMS SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE STATEMENT THAT ALL OF OUR INFORMATION IS ALREADY COMPROMISED PARTICULARLY OUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN WE WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT- THE ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHOSE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS HAVE NOT YET BEEN COMPROMISED IN THIS COUNTRY ARE THE ONES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN. ISSUED THOSE NUMBERS YET. AND IN FACT. WE ARE SEEING THIEVES USE ODD NUMBERS THAT THEY'VE JUST MADE UP. AND THESE NUMBERS ARE ALREADY TAINTED WHEN THEY ARE ISSUED SO. MY RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD BE YES WE HAVE THE DATA I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT REPORT. AND THE SCALE OF IT IS ON TENABLE RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. AND ALL OF OUR DATA AT LEAST A CRITICAL FOUNDATIONAL IDENTITY DATA AND THEY THEN THE P. I. R. THAT'S NECESSARY TO PERPETRATE IDENTITY CRIMES HAS LARGELY BEEN COMPROMISED IN PREVIOUS DATA BREACHES. THANK YOU MISS WEST COAST AND I GUESS AS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT- HOW MUCH OF THIS IS DOMESTIC SORT OF LIKE PETTY CRIMINALS AND I THINK FROM SOME OF YOUR TESTIMONIES. WE HEARD THAT A LOT OF THIS IS LOW HANGING FRUIT IT'S LIKE LOW LEVEL IDENTITY THEFT IDENTITY FRAUD- BUT WE ALSO HEARD ANECDOTALLY AND SEEN REPORTS OF A MAJOR DATA BREACHES COMING FROM FOREIGN HACKERS. AND TRY TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S THE SCALE AND THEN AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS THAT- YOU KNOW YOU'D HAVE JUST STARTED TO IMPOSE SOME RATHER CRIPPLING SANCTIONS ON. RUSSIA AND I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN EVIDENCE THAT THE AMOUNT OF RUSSIAN HACKER ACTIVITY HAS HAS DROPPED PRETTY DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. DO WE THINK THAT THIS WILL HAVE ANY IMPACT ON HACKING COPPERHEADS GIVING FOREIGN ADVERSARIES MORE YOU KNOW AMBITION TO TRY TO GO AFTER U. S. CONSUMERS. ARE PERHAPS LESS RESOURCES AND ABILITY TO ACCESS US CONSUMERS TO HAVE A SENSE OF A SUSPECT THIS WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. WITH THE GLOBAL STAGES CAN IMPACT IDENTITY THEFT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. MR CHAIRMAN LET ME TRY AND THAT A COUPLE OF WAYS IF I MAY FIRST- I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF. DATA THAT WOULD SUPPORT PERCENTAGES OF WHO'S DOING THE ATTACKING PROVIDE. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF POINTS. THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO KNOW FIRST. IS THAT IDENTITY THEFT AND CYBER SECURITY INTRUSIONS. COME FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES ON. THE BIGGEST AND GRANDEST SCALE THEY ARE COMING FROM STATE ACTORS LIKE CHINA AND RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA FOR EXAMPLE. AND THAT MAKES IT PARTICULARLY HARD TO LOCATE AN ADDRESS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AND IT HAS TO HAPPEN AND IT DOES. BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT MANY BUSINESSES ARE AT RISK FOR IT INSIDERS AFTER IN FACT THERE'S BEEN DATA THAT I'VE SEEN RECENTLY THAT SHOWS SMALL BUSINESSES. IN PARTICULAR ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY INVEST. ALL OF THE SECURITY THAT'S NEEDED AND ON TOP OF THAT EVEN IF THEY DID. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INSIDERS HAVE COMING THAT COMES AS A RESULT. OF MANY PERPETRATORS OF IDENTITY THEFT IN THE WORKPLACE FOR EXAMPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THAT WORK PLACE WHICH IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO CHECK THE CREDENTIALS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING. IN THOSE KINDS OF PLACES YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER IT SYSTEMS PAYROLL HR- AND THINGS LIKE THAT- SO. THAT MAYBE THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT- MISTER CHAIR UNDERSTAND THE FRAME OF THIS DEBATE. THANK YOU MISS LASKO STEVEN CUMMINS. I WOULD ONLY ADD TO THAT BUT RANSOMWARE AND THE SAND THESE THESE TYPES OF CYBER THREATS HAVE BEEN INCREASING PRIOR TO THE CONFLICT THAT WHERE IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS MAGICALLY GOING TO DECREASE WE WERE ON THE TREND. TO CONTINUE TO SEE THE INCREASE IN THE TARGET RIGHT NOW IS NOT ACTUALLY A LARGE SWATHS OF CONSUMER DATA IF THEY'RE THEY'RE TARGETING BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES BUT IT'S REALLY TO GET A REFRESH OF THAT DATA AT THE STATIC DATA THAT IS NECESSARY TO PERPETRATE A LOT OF THESE CRIMES IT'S ALREADY OUT THERE AND AS WE ADD NEW MECHANISMS. TO DETECT THAT FRAUD AND DETERMINED THAT FRAUD THEN THOSE THREAT ACTORS NEED THAT ADDITIONAL DATA I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE THAT I CAN GIVE IS AT THAT DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT. IDENTITY THEFT ISSUES BACK IN- LATE LAST EARLY LAST YEAR LATE TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE STATE'S ADDED ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION PROCESSES THAT REQUIRE DRIVER'S LICENSE INFORMATION WE SWEET IMMEDIATELY SAW A SHIFT. WITH THE THREAT ACTORS GOING AFTER AUTO INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE WHO HAS THAT DRIVER'S LICENSE INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE AND WHO MAY NOT HAVE. THE CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP THOSE INTRUSIONS OUT WELL THEY WENT AFTER AUTO INSURERS AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND GEICO WHO DID SUFFER A DATA BREACH EVEN PUT ON THEIR NOTIFICATION WARNING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD THEIR INFORMATION COMPROMISED THAT THEY BELIEVED. THEIR SYSTEMS WERE COMPROMISED AND THAT DATA WAS TAKEN IN ORDER TO COMMIT- UNEMPLOYMENT IDENTITY THEFT AND FRAUD. SO AS WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT AS WE ADD THESE ADDITIONAL FRAMEWORKS THAT THE THIEVES ARE A CRAFTY LOT WHO ARE STAYING ON TOP OF THESE THINGS THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET THE DATA THAT'S NECESSARY TO THWART THOSE. AND IF I MAY ONE MORE THING MISTER CHAIR- THIS WILL ASK AS MAKES A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AS WELL AND AS DID MR GRANT JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO. THERE IS THIS ONGOING PERPETUAL CAT AND MOUSE GAME BETWEEN THE GOOD GUYS AND THE BAD GUYS AND MISTER GRANT MADE A COMMENT- THAT. A LOT OF IDENTITY THEFT THAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A RESULT OF THE FACT THAT THE THIEVES HAVE CAUGHT UP TO THE TECHNOLOGY BUT THERE'S THIS CONSTANT EVOLUTION THAT AS SOON. AS I GET ANY THIEVES FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND OVERTHREW BUSINESSES HAVE TO BUILD UP THAT WALL BETTER BIGGER DIFFERENTLY. AND THEN THE THIEVES TRY TO FIND A WAY IN OVER THROUGH AROUND AND IT'S- AND IT'S A NEVER ENDING CYCLE BUT IT DIED THAT'S JUST REALLY THE NATURE OF THE OF THE PROCESS THANK YOU IN THIS DISCUSSION FITS NICELY IN MY LAST QUESTION BEFORE I ASK THAT I WANT I DID WANNA RECOGNIZE MS AUSTIN WHO WAS OUR HAND RAISED. IS AWESOME YOU MIGHT. I WAS. YES YOU WERE JUST TOO QUICK FOR ME A MISTER CHAIR. SO NOW JUST TWO QUICK POINTS I THINK REALLY TIGHT ENDS TOO- THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS AT COMMENTS WHICH RANG SO TRUE TO ME. AS KIND OF AN UNDERGROUND ON THE GROUND INDIVIDUAL. AND WHEN YOU ASK THE QUESTION- YOU KNOW AND TRY TO NARROW DOWN. YOU KNOW HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS. HAVE SUFFERED FROM THIS TYPE OF VICTIM AND VICTIMIZATION. I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING AND THAT IS THAT. YOU COULD GIVE ME. OR ANY INDIVIDUAL THAT I WORK WITH. A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. AND WITHIN AN HOUR I COULD HAVE COLLECTED ENOUGH OF YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. THROUGH THE INTERNET TO HAVE A FULL WHAT WE CALL IN THE CRIMINALS. ARE PRACTICED PROFILE ON YELP. AND THAT IS THROUGH POSSIBLY PURCHASING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. ACTUALLY THE DARK LAB- PUBLIC SEARCHES THAT I WOULD PAY A SMALL. FEE TO BE ABLE TO GET ALL OF YOUR YOU KNOW TITLE DOCUMENTS. TITLED THAT IS JUST CRAZY RAMPANT THESE DAYS- AND I WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A- VERY. HEARTY PACKET. ON ANYBODY. NOW SO. SO EVEN IF AN INDIVIDUAL ISN'T QUITE. REGISTERED OR RESPONDING. AS A VICTIM OF THESE TYPES OF CRIMES OR BEING CAPTURED BY THE DATA. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT BEHIND MY COMPUTER WITH A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION PERHAPS JUST EVEN YOUR NAME. I CAN HAVE AN ENTIRE PROFILE ON YOU THAT WOULD ALLOW ME. TO PERPETRATE. THESE TYPES OF CRIMES. IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME SO IT'S JUST KIND OF. A WAY TO THINK ABOUT. OUR VULNERABILITY INSTEAD OF JUST KIND OF THE NUMBERS OF WHO'S ACTUALLY. BEEN EXPOSED AND THEN JUST ONE OTHER READ COMMENTS ABOUT THE INNER. ISSUE INCURRED IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS A COMMODITY ON THE WORLD MARKET. IT IS OUR GUY AS INDIVIDUALS A PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MY NAME. MY GENDER MY SOCIAL MY DRIVER'S LICENSE WHERE I LIVE WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL ALL OF THOSE THINGS MY MEDICAL RECORDS. ZACH IS A MASSIVE COMMODITY. ON THE GRAY MARKET. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS RIGHT THIS VERY MOMENT THIS INFORMATION IS BEING PACKAGED AND RESOLD. AND DUMPS SOMETIMES WHAT WE MIGHT CALL A DATA DUMP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND SO THE VERY INSIDIOUS NATURE OF THE- KIND OF OMNIPRESENCE THEFT OF OUR IDENTITIES BEING COMPROMISED AND STOLEN. IS THAT THERE IS A HUGE FINANCIAL MOTIVATION. OR INDIVIDUAL ARE NOT ANY INDIVIDUAL EXCUSE ME INTERNATIONAL- ENTITIES. THAT ARE OFTEN SUPPORTED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT. TO COLLECT AND SELL THIS DATA. AS A VERY- HIGH LEVEL QUEMADA ON THE MARKET AND SO WE HAVE GOVERNMENT ACTORS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND RUSSIA IS ONE THAT WE KNOW. HAS SPECIALIZED IN THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF- MANIPULATION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S IDENTITY. WHERE IN. COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CITIZENRY AND IN PARTICULAR CITIZENS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS FAIR GAME. CHINA'S WE DON'T HAVE WE CAN'T NECESSARILY REACH OUT AND TOUCH THOSE ACTORS BUT WE CAN FOCUS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE CONDUCT ONCE IT FALLS BACK HERE THANK YOU MS AUSTIN PRITCHETT- AND WE WILL JUST FOR THE RECORD GET TO YOU AND TO MR GRANT IN JUST A MOMENT WITH PANEL TOO I HAD ONE LAST QUESTION FOR PANEL ONE AND THEN I DO WANT TO OPEN UP MY COLLEAGUES AND GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING I THINK YOU'D DISCUSSED HOW. THE HACKERS WERE INVOLVING A LOT OF WAYS TO TRY TO HIT WEAK POINTS IN AND CATCH UP TO- AREAS IT WEAK TARGETS- TRYING TO SORT OF TARGET RICH ENVIRONMENTS- I WAS WONDER IF YOU COULD BRIEFLY SPEAK TO- ANY TREND YOU'D SEEN IN RECENT YEARS OR MONTHS AS TO THE TACTICS THEY'RE USING THE TYPES OF IDENTITY THEFT THERE TORY TARGETING. THE TYPES OF ACTORS WITH THE SMALL BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO WHO ARE THEY MOVING TO- JUST KIND OF GIVING US A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. MR CHER. IF I MAY JUST START ANSWERING THE QUESTION I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BIGGER WEAKNESSES THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT AND- IDENTITY THEFT ARE CONSUMERS THEMSELVES. THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO USE SPEAR PHISHING AND OTHER. ATTACKS CLICK ON THIS CLICK ON THAT- I AM LOOKING FOR TO RAISE FUNDS FOR MY CHARITY- I AM AMAZON TRYING TO VERIFY YOUR PURCHASE. THINGS LIKE THAT. THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CARE THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY DONE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF EFFICIENCY ON THE PART OF INDIVIDUALS. AND AS YOU KNOW THE CHAIN. OF OF STRENGTH IS ONLY AS WEAK AS ITS WEAKEST LINK. AND UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF CONSUMERS THEMSELVES CAN BE THEIR OWN WORST ENEMIES ARE THEIR OWN WORST VICTIMS. THANK YOU MR MCMAHON'S OFFICE. YES I I'D LIKE TO COMMENT THAT WHILE THERE IS SOME SOME TROOPS TO- CONSUMERS BEING A PART OFTHIS EQUATION- AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING GOING ON RIGHT NOW- THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN- IT RISE SIGNIFICANTLY- HACKED INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS- GOOGLE VOICE UNFORTUNATELY THE THREAT ACTORS ARE ESSENTIALLY TALKING PEOPLE INTO SHARING THEIR MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION CODES IT'S THEY'RE GIVING THEM A REALLY GOOD REASON AND THEY'RE MAKING IT VERY VERY PERSONAL SO IF AN INDIVIDUAL HAS A PROFILE WHERE THERE'RE- VERY MUCH- A VERY GIVING PERSON THEY VOLUNTEER FOR- CAUSES AND THEIR PURPOSE DRIVEN AND- THE- PERHAPS DONATE TO CHARITIES. THAT WILL BE THE HOOK I THEY'LL REACH OUT TO THEM IN SOME WAY- I DON'T YOU WANT TO HELP ME WITH MY CHARITY DONATE TO THIS CHARITY AND HERE'S HOW YOU CAN DO IT AND THEY END UP THAT YOU TALKING THEM INTO CONVINCING THEM TO SHARING- NOT ONLY THEIR LOG IN CREDENTIALS BUT THAT ALSO IF THEY HAVE MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION THOSE THOSE MFA COATS. AND THAT FROM OUR VIEW WHEN WE ARE TALKING TO THESE VICTIMS THOSE ARE THE SMALLER DOMESTIC- CRIMINALS THE LARGE SCALE FRAUD RINGS AREN'T IN IT REALLY ENGAGING AND THAT LEVEL OF BEHAVIOR WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE LARGER RANGE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AS THE RANSOMWARE AND THE TARGET OF. UP FOR THE RANSOMWARE THREAT ACTORS IS REALLY- LARGER BUSINESSES YES SOME SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES BUT REALLY IT'S THE LARGER BUSINESSES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY AFTER THAT CONSUMER DATA THEY WANT ALL OF THE BUSINESS INFORMATION AND DATA THEIR THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WELL SOME OF THAT CONSUMER DATA BE SWEPT UP IN THAT NECK BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THE TARGET SO WE. WE DO NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE SO. CONFLATE THESE THESE ISSUES AND TRY TO- SUMMARIZE AND TO THE POINT THAT THEY WE'VE JUST WE HAVEN'T DISTILLED THEM ENOUGH BECAUSE REALLY THERE'S SO MUCH OF THIS GOING ON WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT PARTICULAR THREAT ACTORS AND WHAT THEIR MOTIVATIONS ARE WHAT THEY'RE AFTER AND UNFORTUNATELY- THE BARRED ENTRY IN THE FRAUD ECOSYSTEM AS I'M SURE- MISS AUSTIN CAN. I CAN ATTEST TO HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY LOWERED YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY HAVE ANY SPECIAL SKILL SET TO BECOME. A FRAUDSTER AND IT THERE'S A VERY LARGE BREATH OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMMITTING THIS FRAUD AND THEIR TARGETS ARE VARIED. YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT AS WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN ADDED AND- WE'VE ALL SEEN THOSE EMAILS AND THEY'RE REALLY GOOD AND THEY'RE REALLY PERSUASIVE AND THEY'RE REALLY COMPELLING AND EVEN THE MOST TRAINED AND VERSED- IN NOT CLICKING THINGS. CAN FALL PREY I CLICKED ON ONE LINK- TOO MANY AND CAUSE HAVOC HERE IN MY OFFICE A FEW YEARS AGO SO IT DOES HAPPEN AND EVEN AS GOOD AS AND THOUGHTFUL AND CAREFUL AS CONSUMERS ARE THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF BAD GUYS OUT THERE THAT ARE REALLY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO. WHICH IS WHY AS MR GRANT SAID FOR EXAMPLE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS TO PARTNER WITH GOVERNMENTS TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE- TO KEEP THESE INSTANCES OF IDENTITY THEFT AS LOW AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ALLMAN- IS ALASKA'S I WANT TO OPEN UP TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS HERE FOR EITHER THE PANELS- AND I WANT TO FIRST ASK IF MY VICE CHAIR- BORDERS HAS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CHAIR. OF THEM WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS- FOR- APPEARING TODAY. VERY INFORMATIVE VERY HELPFUL- THIS MIGHT BE A QUESTION TO POSE TO- MISTER GRANT- OR ANYBODY ELSE FOR THAT MATTER- DO YOU THINK THAT. FROM A LEGISLATIVE STANDPOINT HE IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE- TO HAVE A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT MANDATED THE DISCLOSURE OF A RANSOMWARE EVENT OR A BREACH OF ANY KIND SO THAT INDIVIDUALS OR BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT. NOTICES FORMAL NOTICES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A MEANS FOR US TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH UP TO DATE KNOWLEDGE AS WHAT'S OCCURRING AS WELL AS DISCLOSED TO THOSE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. DO YOU THINK SOME LIKE THAT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE. WELL I'LL SAY THEY'RE ALREADY GETTING PRETTY MUCH EVERY STATE HAS A DATA BREACH LAWN PLACE TODAY ALREADY AND SO YOU HAVE REPORTING GOING ON- YOU KNOW BASED OUT OF WASHINGTON DC THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OVER WHETHER THINGS LIKE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS IF. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S. AN ORGANIZATION AS PART OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE J. LIKE THE COLONIAL PIPELINE THAT WE SAW. I GET ATTACKED ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHETHER THAT NEEDS TO BE REPORTED TO SOMEBODY LIKE DEPARTMENT HOMELAND SECURITY CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY. BECAUSE IT HAS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT ON TOP OF JUST DATA BEING STOLEN- BUT- I WILL SAY A DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION IS NOT AN AREA WHERE I AM I AM. I HAVE DEEP EXPERTISE BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT CALIFORNIA OTHER STATES ALREADY HAVE LAWS TODAY THAT ARE ARE COVERING- THOSE SORTS OF INCIDENCES SO WHAT DO WE HAVE A RULE ON RANSOMWARE. WELL I WAS GOING TO ASK IF WE MIGHT REFER THAT QUESTION TO DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL LAWSON WHO MIGHT BE WELL POSITIONED ANSWER. I'M WITH WE I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT NOTIFICATION REGARDING RANSOMWARE SCENARIOS WHICH I NOW HAVE BECOME YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY VERY SIGNIFICANT- WE DO AND HAVE A LONG STANDING REPORTING LIVE AS SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER GRANT MENTIONS THAT MANY STATES ACTUALLY MODELED AFTER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- AT MOST- AS FAR AS I AM AWARE THAT MOST BUSINESS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS WELL AWARE OF IT AND TO COMPLY WITH THOSE REPORTING- LIES IN TERMS OF NOTIFYING. YOU FRY GOT NOTICE CHECK NOTIFICATIONS YOURSELF WE GET ON SO OFTEN THAT OFTEN TIMES WE DON'T EVEN PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOU GET A NEW CREDIT CARD IN THE MAIL AND THEY TELL YOU TO THROW OUT YOUR OLD ONE HI BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ONE- SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO RANSOMWARE. THANK YOU AND I SEE MISS ALASKA'S HAS HER HAND UP. OF I CAN CONFIRM THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC LAW RELATED TO RANSOMWARE WE DO HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE OUR DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LAW AND- I THINK EVERYONE. LISTENING SHOULD PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK BECAUSE IT WAS CALIFORNIA THAT STARTED THE TREND IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR THEY PASSED THE- MAYBE WAS TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN IT WAS PASSED BUT IT WENT INTO EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN THE I. T. R. C. SUBSEQUENTLY STARTED CAPTURING THIS REPORTED DATA TWO THOUSAND FIVE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO THINK ABOUT THE NOTIFICATION LAWS EVEN THOUGH THEY EXIST IN ALL OF THE STATES. I CAN'T SAY THAT OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN US THAT MANY OF THE NOTIFICATIONS. OUR I DON'T WANT TO SAY LARGELY MEANING LESS BUT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY IN THE NOTIFICATIONS TO MAKE THEM MEANINGFUL ENOUGH TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED AND JUST THINGS LIKE SPECIFICALLY LISTING WHAT SPECIFIC DATA WAS COMPROMISED- COULD ACTUALLY BE VERY HELPFUL SO SOME OF THESE NOTIFICATIONS THAT ARE SENT OUT WILL SAY SOMETHING A BREACH HAS OCCURRED BUT THEY GIVE. UP VERY LITTLE GRANULAR DATA AND- FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS COMPROMISED SO IT WE COULD ALSO PERHAPS FOCUS ON- BEEFING UP AND END UP MAKING THOSE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR NOTIFICATION OF MORE MEANINGFUL AND MORE TRANSPARENT AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR THE- END THE VICTIMS THAT ARE AFFECTED. THANK YOU ESPECIALLY ON THE RANSOMWARE AKAM INTERIM I DID HAVE A CONSTITUENT THAT- WENT THROUGH A PROCESS LIKE THIS. AND IT BECAME COST OF DOING BUSINESS CALCULATION ON WHETHER THEY JUST SIMPLY PAID- BUT THEY DID NOTIFY THE FBI AND GIVEN THE STRUCTURE VOLUME OF HOW THESE ARE BEING CONDUCTED. EVERY SINGLE DAY EVERY SINGLE HOUR THERE'S SIMPLY- OVERWHELMED AND IF YOU I THINK WE ALSO ENCOUNTER- A DEGREE OF DISCRETION THAT CERTAIN BUSINESSES WANT TO BE DISCREET- ABOUT THE DISCLOSURE OF WHAT OCCURRED. AND THE FACT THAT THEY PAID OUT AND I HAD HEARD SOMEBODY MENTION WHETHER OR NOT. THERE WOULD BE LEGISLATION CONTEMPLATED. CORLEY'S POLICY CONSIDERED TO BE CONTEMPLATED THAT WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO PAY A RANSOM- AND I KNOW THAT GETS INTO A WHOLE. HORNET'S NEST OF LEGAL ISSUES- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ALL IN ALL CONCLUDE HERE GIVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE UTILITY. OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M ASSUMING THAT IS THAT DIRECTED TO ME YES IT IS- I THINK THE DEVIL WOULD BE IN THE DETAILS IN THAT IN THAT SITUATION BECAUSE THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND SO WHILE TRANSPARENCY WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE IMPACTED AND THEIR DATA IS COMPROMISED IS- NOT AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RANSOMWARE. PROCESSES THERE IT IT HAS BECOME A CALCULATED BUSINESS DECISION AND- THE I.TERROR SEASON ORGANIZATION CURRENTLY HAS NOT TAKEN AN OFFICIAL STANCE ON WHETHER RETAIL. ADVISED BUSINESSES TO EITHER PAY OR NOT PAY THE RANSOM AT THIS POINT IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS DECISION. AND THUS FAR WHAT WE'VE SEEN. IS THAT THE THREAT ACTORS. IT'S OUR- HISTORICALLY THEY HAVE BEEN HONORING THE CODE AND SO WHEN THE RANSOM IS PAID THEY ARE NOT RELEASING THE DATA WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE A FEW OF THE BAD ACTORS WHO ARE GOING AHEAD EVEN WHEN THE RANSOM IS PAID THEY'RE RELEASING THE DATA SO. THE ENTIRE. BUSINESS MODEL AND I USE THAT TERM LOOSELY. IT COULD COLLAPSE AS AS THE THIEVES ACT WITHOUT HONOR AND START RELEASING THE DATA ANYWAY- BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE UTILITY OF. MAKING THAT. NOT PAYING A RANSOM OUR REQUIRE- LET JUST A REQUIREMENT OR LEGISLATING THAT. THANK YOU A CENTER BORDERS- AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THOSE SO SELECTED LEGISLATION LIKE THIS IN THE PAST AND- IT'S SOMETHING I KNOW. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- WORKING ON TOGETHER SO. AT THIS ISSUE IN SOME OF THE PROS AND CONS. OF CINDERELLA GIVEN QUESTIONS YEAH I DIDN'T. KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I THINK YOU HAVING A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION IF YOU'RE SPEAKING TO A PANEL IN CONGRESS- YOUR STATE GOVERNMENT. WHAT DO YOU AROUND THE COUNTRY. CAN YOU GIVE ME. ANY VIEW- YOUR YOUR SENSE OF BEST PRACTICES IS THERE IS THERE A- OF SOME LAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS. WERE BEING CONSIDERED IN OTHER STATES. THAT WE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT AND CONSIDER AS WE'RE TRYING TO THINK OF WAYS TO. ADDRESS THE VERY REAL ISSUES AND VERY FRIGHTENING ISSUES EVEN RAISING TODAY AND IN TODAY'S HEARING. I THINK ERIC MAYBE TRYING TO TALK WITH THEM YET BUT ALWAYS SAY I SOUND BETTER ON MUTE- A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS- SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THERE'S A NUMBER OF. STATUTES AND RULES THAT I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY PRESENTATION THAT ARE IN PLACE THAT I THINK ARE REALLY HELPFUL FOR EXAMPLE- FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO HAVE A HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE MATCHING ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS% LIKE A DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER AND A SOCIAL AND DATE OF BIRTH AND OTHERS. THERE'S REQUIREMENTS THAT OUR MEMBERS THE CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES REPORT ADDRESS DISCREPANCIES TO USERS OF CONSUMER REPORTS LIKE LENDERS AND CREDITORS AND OTHERS AND THERE'S A LONG LIST OF STATUTES AND RULES THATARE IN PLACE BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE NATIONALLY- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS MISTER GRANT HAD MENTIONED IS THAT A LOT OF ARE A LOT OF THEIR STRUCTURES STRUCTURES THAT WE'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER OUR PAPER BASED FOR AN ELECTRONIC WORLD AND- MSTER GRANT MENTIONED SOME THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR TO HELP. BUT THAT WAS THAT SENATOR ALAN THAT GIVES YOU JUST A FEW HIGHLIGHTS OF SOME OF THE MANY STATUTES AND RULES THAT ARE OUT THERE TO ATTEMPT TO HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND I WOULD JUST SAY ON MY SIDE I THINK PART OF IT'S GOING TO. YEAH I'VE SEEN A LOT OF YOU KNOW BILLS FOCUSING ON. PUNISHMENTS IF A COMPANY IS BREACHED. WHICH CAN BE HELPFUL AS AN INCENTIVE TO PUT BETTER CONTROLS IN PLACE BUT YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES YOU'RE DEALING WITH A VERY SOPHISTICATED NATION STATE. WHO'S COMING AFTER A SMALL COMPANY AND- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHETHER THE STICK IS ALWAYS THE BEST APPROACH OR WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO TO. YOU KNOW GETTING BACK TO THE POINT I RAISED EARLIER IN MY OPENING STATEMENT. HOW DO YOU GET AWAY FROM THESE. OUTDATED SYSTEMS WHERE KNOWLEDGE OF MY PERSONAL DATA. MEANS THAT I'D MEET. IN YOU KNOW SOME YOU KNOW ORGANIZATIONS- WAY TO TURPIN WHO'S WHO. AND ACTUALLY SHIFT TO SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT STRONGER STAYING FOCUSED ON. POSSESSION OF SOMETHING YEAH I MENTIONED YOU KNOW I CAN I CAN WALK INTO A BANK I CAN WALK INTO A GOVERNMENT BUILDING- WITH MY DRIVER'S LICENSE MY PASSPORT. THAT MODEL THAT WORKS IN PERSON WHERE THEY CAN LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT I POSSESS IN HIS PHYSICAL SECURITY FEATURES. HASN'T TRANSLATED SO WELL ONLINE. AND SO I'M YOU KNOW TO GO BACK TO WHAT I SAID BEFORE I'M A REALLY BIG PROPONENT OF WHAT STATES COULD DO WITH DIGITAL CREDENTIALS YOU KNOW THE COUNTERPART TO THE DRIVER'S LICENSE AND STATE ID CARDS. AS A WAY TO GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. AND THAT BUSINESSES CAN USE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. AGAINST ALL OF THESE ATTACKS THAT ARE YOU KNOW USING STOLEN DATA. TO COMPROMISE IDENTITY. THOSE ARE VERY SCALABLE TAX IN FACT SOME OF THE TYPES OF ATTACKS THAT YOU KNOW THE OTHER YOU KNOW WITNESSES WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. ARE NOW GETTING AUTOMATED BY BOTS WHERE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY NECESSARILY AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE TO TRICK SOMEBODY INTO HANDING SOMETHING OVER. YOU GET A EITHER DOES IT THESE DAYS IT'S AUTOMATED- SO YOU KNOW COREY FOR INNOVATION ON THE ADVERSARY SIDE. SAYING THAT SARCASTICALLY. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY WORTH NOTING. HOW SOPHISTICATED THE ATTACKERS HAVE GOTTEN BECAUSE THESE ATTACKS ARE SO LUCRATIVE AND THEY'RE ABLE TO YOU KNOW THE ATTACKERS CAN JUST SLICE THROUGH WHATEVER WE CONTROLS WE HAVE. IN PLACE. AND SO I THINK GETTING TO THING IT'S LIKE. STRONGER DIGITAL CREDENTIALS MOBILE DRY LICENSE A SUMP THE STATE PRIVATE. MY KNEE THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME IN THE NEAR TERM. I THINK WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE I USED TO RUN THE DIGITAL IDENTITY GROUP. AT NEST. THIS TEST DIGITAL IDENTITY GUIDELINES THAT ARE- WIDELY USED NOT JUST IN THE U. S. BUT ACROSS THE GLOBE. THAT PRESCRIBE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WHAT PEOPLE CALL IDENTITY PROOFING A DIFFERENT ASSURANCE LEVELS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SETTLED ON IS THE MID LEVEL TO HAVE WHAT'S KNOWN AS I. ALE TO IDENTITY ASSURANCE LEVEL TWO. THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE TODAY THAT ARE CERTIFIED AS MEETING THOSE NEW SOLUTIONS. YOU KNOW. I'LL SAY IT CAN BE. A BIT OF A PAIN IN THE **** TO PUT SOMEBODY THROUGH THEM BUT ARGUABLY LESS SO THAN HAVING YOUR CUSTOMER. AND BECOME A VICTIM YOU KNOW DOWNSTREAM- BUT LEVERAGING THOSE SOLUTIONS CERTAINLY FOR. YOU KNOW WEATHER'S SENSITIVE DATA OR A LOT OF MONEY THAT IS AT STAKE YOU KNOW THOSE KIND OF TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT TODAY CAN START TO HELP AND THEN LOOKED AT YOU KNOW MIGRATE TO OTHER POSSESSION BASED TOOLS. LIKE A MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE IN THE FUTURE. IRAN YOU COMFORT AND AID UNDERSTAND IT THE COMMITTEE DOING SOME WORK IN THAT YEAH I WAS I WAS GONNA ASK YOU- AS AS JUST A FOLLOW UP TO THAT MISTER GRAND I READ YOUR TESTIMONY WITH GREAT INTEREST I WOULD LISTEN TO A GREAT INTEREST AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD BECAUSE- YEAH I AS I MENTIONED I MYSELF HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND I GET THOSE NOTICES THAT MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ADDRESS AND MY KIDS ARE ON THE DARK WEB OCCASIONALLY- AND SO I THOUGHT YOUR PROPOSAL FOR MOBILE DM DRIVER'S LICENSE WAS WAS VERY INTERESTING THE DIGITAL CREDENTIALING WAS VERY INTERESTING. THE QUICK THING THAT I DID NOT SEE A DRASTIC TESTIMONIES IS- WHETHER WE WOULD NEED THE CREDIT REPORTING BUREAUS OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO ALSO ACCEPT THIS SUMMER THAT REQUIRES SOME KIND OF STATUTORY CHANGES WELL I JUST BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE ACTUAL IDENTITY FRAUD TAKES PLACE IN FINANCIAL FRAUD I AND I DIDN'T SEE THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN LIKE IT'S GREAT TO HAVE ANOTHER FORM OF IDENTIFICATION BUT THE DID I THINK THE MAIN DISCONNECT I HAVE IS THAT THE I. D. THEFT THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW ANTI FRAUD IS COMING FROM ACTUALLY- PRIMARILY AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. I THINK IT'S A GOOD POINTS I'LL SAY A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS ARE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CREDIT BUREAUS ARE ALSO MEMBERS. THE LATTER WEREN'T INVITED ME FIRST. THE GROUP FIRST FORMED JOB. PART BECAUSE SOME OF THEM. WHAT IS IT. SOME OF THE BANKS WANT TO GET BEYOND KNOWLEDGE BASE TOOLS THAT THEY WERE OFFERING- BUT AFTER WE PUBLISHED OUR BLUEPRINT A COUPLE YEARS AGO THEY ALL CAME TO US AND SO WE ACTUALLY THINK ON BALANCE THIS IS. WHAT WE NEED TO GO IN SO IT'S BEEN A GREAT COALITION ARE REGARDING THE WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES ALL SUPPORTING THIS POLICY BLUEPRINT- SO THE SHORT ANSWER THAT WAS DO YOU NEED NEW LAWS IF YOU HAVE DIGITAL CREDENTIALS TO ENABLE TO BE ACCEPTED. YOU DON'T- THE DRIVER'S LICENSE IS ALREADY. YOU KNOW. TRICKIER TO FACTO YOU KNOW NATIONAL ID TODAY FOR MOST PEOPLE. IN CONGRESS ACTUALLY YEAR AND A HALF AGO PASSED SOMETHING CALLED REAL ID MODERNIZATION ACT WHICH UPDATED. THE STATUTE FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE THAT CREATED THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR THE REAL ID DRIVER'S LICENSES. TO SAY THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO JUST BE A PLASTIC CARD IT COULD ALSO BE A DIGITAL CREDENTIALS- AND BY THE WEIGHT THAT WAS ONLY REALLY NEEDED FOR THE TSA. OR OTHER PARTS OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE- DIGITAL CREDENTIAL IN LITTLE PLASTIC- A CARD. BUT IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR WITH THE CREDIT BUREAUS ARE PRETTY MUCH ANY INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW TODAY THEY'RE BASICALLY REQUIRED TO DO RISK BASED ASSESSMENTS TO PROVE THAT YOU REALLY ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE YOU KNOW IN BANKING INSTRUMENT PEOPLE TEND TO CALL THE KYC PROCESS KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER- AND SO. THEY'RE BEING YOU KNOW IN THE DIGITAL WORLD A MIX OF PRODUCTS TODAY- THAT. SOME OF THEM ARE QUITE GOOD SOME OF THEM ARE ONCE ATTACKERS HAVE CAUGHT UP WITH- I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT THE ONLY SOLUTION IS A LOT OF GREAT INNOVATION HAPPENING. IN THE SPACE A LOT OF IT BEING DRIVEN BY COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA- TO STAY AHEAD OF THE ATTACKERS. BUT. AT THE END OF THE DAY GETTING TO THAT. HOW WOULD I SAY IT. A LOT OF INDUSTRIES. TO GET. FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM BUT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT REALLY KNOWS THE GOVERNMENT IS THE ONLY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AUTHORITATIVE ASHORE BY KENNEDY AND SO YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL CREDENTIALS I THINK IS HOW WE START TO BRING WORK DETERMINATIVE FACTORS INTO THINGS INSTEAD OF THESE PREDICTIVE FACTORS- BUT NO INDUSTRY WOULD NOT NEED. AS FAR AS I KNOW ANY ADDITIONAL LAWS OR STATUTES TO BE PASSED REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO START ACCEPTING DIGITAL CREDENTIALS THAT WERE BACKED BY BY GOVERNMENTS THEY WOULD NEED TO CHANGE IN PRACTICES THOUGH IS THAT CORRECT. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE AT THAT DECIDE TO ADOPT YEAH AND IN THIS CASE- WE'VE GOT- HOW WOULD I SAY IT. THEY'RE ALL EAGER TO DO THAT THESE DAYS I THINK THIS IS VERY MUCH A MATTER OF IF YOU LOOK INTO SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE THEY'RE SAYING IF YOU BUILD THIS WE WILL COME UP YEAH- YOU KNOW THE COALITION AGAIN IT WAS YOU KNOW FORMED OUT OF THE- THE WAKE OF THE EQUIFAX BREACH WHEN A LOT OF COMPANIES. WERE SAYING WHAT WE'RE GETTING TODAY IN TERMS OF KNOWLEDGE BASED SOLUTIONS FROM VENDORS WE NEED TO GET TO SOMETHING BETTER YEAH AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY THEY'VE ALL COME TOGETHER TO YOU KNOW INVESTED IN. DENTAL FIRST TRADING IN AND YOU KNOW SUPPORTING THIS COALITION ADVOCATING FOR THE POLICIES IS THEY ARE VERY EAGER TO START USING THESE TOOLS- BUT I'LL JUST SAY AS AN EXAMPLE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE'VE WORKED IN IN FACT MR ALLMAN I'VE HAD BOTH BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. CONGRESS REQUIRED THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM- THE ACRONYMS TERRIBLE ALONG LIKE A LOT OF GOVERNMENT ACRONYMS ECB SPD ELECTRONIC CONSENT BASED SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER VERIFICATION SYSTEM IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WENT- TO CONGRESS AND PUSH FOR- TO TRYING TO DRESS WHAT HAS BEEN THE FASTEST GROWING TYPE OF IDENTITY FRAUD ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE WHICH IS SYNTHETIC IDENTITY FRAUD. WHERE IT'S NOT THAT I'M STEALING ERIC'S INFORMATION OR EVEN AS INFORMATION AND YOU KNOW POSING AS THEM IT SAID I'M CREATING ESSENTIALLY A DIGITAL FRANKENSTEIN WHERE I MIGHT TAKE. MY NAME AND ERIC'S KIDS SSN YOU KNOW THE BUREAU'S MIGHT NOT HAVE SEEN AND SENDING OUT WITH A FAKE BIRTHDAY AND APPLYING FOR CREDIT AND ESSENTIALLY TRICKING YOU KNOW THE BANKS AND THE COMPANIES THAT THEY WORK WITH INTO THINKING THAT THIS IS A REAL PERSON IN ISSUING CREDITS YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUT OUT A REPORT ABOUT A MONTH AGO THEY SAID THIS IS NOW COSTING ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN LOSSES IN THE BANKING SYSTEM. ALL BECAUSE- IF I'M APPLYING TO A BANK. ONLINE AND I SAY I'M JEREMY GRANT WITH THE PARTICULAR DATE OF BIRTH AND SSN. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WAY FOR THAT BANK OR THEIR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND END ANY VERIFICATION SIDE TO ASK THE SSA. IS THERE REALLY THAT PERSON WHO'S NOT THAT. AND SO THE INABILITY TO SIMPLY GET A YES NO ANSWER ME NOBODY'S ASKING NECESSARY TO START SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT'S GOT A LOT OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES. JUST HOURS EIGHTY YES NO THERE REALLY IS A JEREMY TO GRANT WITH MY DATE OF BIRTH AND SSN WHO'S NOT DEAD. IS AN ESSENTIAL TOOL TO YOU KNOW WEED OUT THE SYNTHETIC IDENTITY FRAUD AND SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE BANK'S ADVOCATED FOR IT AND NOW THEY'RE ALL INVESTING TO BUILD IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR IT ACTUALLY HAS TO SAY IS REQUIRED TO. COLLECT FEES AND I THINK THEY'RE AVERAGING ABOUT A MILLION TRANSACTIONS A WEEK NOW THROUGH THAT AS THE SYSTEM COMES ON A PILOT HOPEFULLY TO RAMP UP TO. YOU KNOW TEN OR TWENTY TIMES THAT OVER THE NEXT YEAR. SO INDUSTRIES VERY HUNGRY FOR THIS AND WILLING TO ADAPT- AND CHANGE THEIR WAYS THANKS FOR THE I. I WOULD AGREE IF I IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR- JUST TO PIGGYBACK ON WHAT MR GRANT SAID THAT THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THE BET FOR THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND CREDIT BUREAUS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OFTENTIMES. THE FINANCIAL REASONS IN THE CREDIT BUREAUS THAT HAVE TO COVER THE LOSSES. AND IT'S IN IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL YOUR QUESTION MISTER CHAIR IS IF YOU BUILD IT WILL THEY COME AND I AND MISTER GRANT I THINK HAS LAID OUT A VERY GOOD CASE AS TO WHY THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. IS YES AND- AMONGST ONE AMONGST THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO IN ADDITION TO THE ECB. S. V. READ MUNCH. WE ALSO HAVE ACCESS EXAMPLE THE DEATH MASTER FILE. WHICH IS JUST AS A STAPLE OF THE DECEASED ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR. SEEKING BENEFITS THAT ALLOWS US TO- BANK CREDIT FROM BEING ISSUED IN A DECEDENT'S NAME OFFER IDENTITY THEFT PURPOSES. WHILE THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A DEATH MASTER FILE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A BIRTH MASTER FILE SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ACCESS. TO NEW SSNS ARE BEING ISSUED I THINK THE ECB S. V. IS A GOOD START TO GET US ON THAT ROAD BUT THERE WERE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW TOOLS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO TRY AS BEST AS WE CAN. KEEP THE INCIDENTS OF FRAUD AS LOW AS POSSIBLE AND I WOULD JUST THE TRUTH WANT TO CLARIFY I THINK MR GRANT'S. RESPONSE TO THAT JUST I THOUGHT THE PART IN YOUR TESTIMONY WHERE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT AND NOT IDENTIFIER AND AUTHENTICATOR WAS WAS. INTERESTING AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT MATCHES WITH WITH OTHER WHAT OTHER FOLKS THAT I'VE TALKED TO SAID. WHICH IS THAT THE SS AND IS VERY USEFUL AS AN IDENTIFIER- THAT IS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WHOLE BODY OF INFORMATION ABOUT US. IT IS PROBABLY NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A SECRET ASSETS AND WHEN THE ASSET MOST OF OUR SSNS ARE ALREADY OUT THERE ON THE DARK WEB. MAKES LESS AND LESS SENSE OVER TIME AND SO THE IDEA THAT IT COULD BE USED IN A AS AN AUTHENTICATOR THAT IS TO SAY PROOF OF WHO I AM. RATHER THAN JUST AN IDENTIFIER THERE IS SOMEBODY NICKNAMED DAVE MEN WITH MY DATE OF BIRTH AND- THE FOLLOWING ATTRIBUTES- IT MAKES NO SENSE NO E. SETTLE ON THE MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE. NOT ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT I WAS PITCHED TO ME BY SOME OTHER GROUPS WAS THE ACCESS AND PLUS- AND I TAKE FROM YOUR TESTIMONY THAT PART OF THE REASON THE MAIN REASON THAT YOU THINK THAT THAT'S REDUNDANT AND UNNECESSARY. IS THAT THE MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE WOULD ALREADY COP WITH THAT PURPOSE AT A FAR SMALLER FRACTION THE CLASSES IS THAT A CORRECT SUMMARY. THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE- GET UP TO GET TO A POINT YOU KNOW MR ALLMAN BEFORE TALKED ABOUT THE OLD DOG ON THE INTERNET CARTOON YEAH- IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT CARTOON IS GOING TO. TURN TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD THIS JULY. WE MEANS. THOSE DOGS ARE A- NOT WITH US ANYMORE BECAUSE DOG YEARS IN THEIR KIDS PROBABLY HAVE PASSED ON AS WELL. THIS IS BEEN A REALLY HARD PROBLEM TO SOLVE. AND THERE THERE'S A REASON WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH IT IT'S NOT THAT GETTING ATTENTION ALL THIS TIME YEAH BUT NO I THINK THE IDEA OF. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN THE WAKE OF THE EQUIFAX BREACH YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE SSN OR DO SOMETHING ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WITH THAT THAT. HONESTLY ALL THOSE PICTURES KIND OF CONFOUNDED ME IN TERMS OF I WASN'T CLEAR HOW THAT WOULD HELP. YOU KNOW MY TAKE WAS JUST ACCEPT THAT IT'S AN IDENTIFIER AND IT SHOULD NEVER BE AN AUTHENTICATOR AND IF WE TRY TO. MAKE THE S. ASCEND INTO SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT- I JUST DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT FAR ALTHOUGH WE COULD CERTAINLY SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CONFUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE. NONE OF THEM. I MEAN IF I COULD JUST- I GUESS ONE QUESTION I HAD ABOUT YOUR MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SOMEONE WHO SUFFERED A BREACH. IF THE MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE IS MEANT TO BE AN AUTHENTICATOR WHICH I TAKE IT IS- WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT GETS BREACHED AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKED ABOUT THE SS AND- PLUS. IS THAT YOU COULD CHANGE IT AT THE WAY IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME IF YOU COULD HAVE AN SS AND ATTACHED TO LIKE A FOUR DIGIT. ALPHANUMERIC CODE JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE ONE ITERATION OF NSS AND ALTERNATIVE- ED AND SO WHO'S EVER BREACHED ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE THE HELP OF. THEM THAT YOU KNOW YOU SHOW YOUR IDENTIFICATION. YOU ARE THEY PROCREATE AND SEEN YOU COULD CHANGE THAT NUMBER. INTO SOMETHING ELSE I NOW PROTECT PROTECTS AGAINST A LIKELY INCIDENTS OF FUTURE HACKING IN FUTURE THEFT- SO DOES YOUR MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE PROPOSAL HAVE SOME MUTABILITY. ADAPTABILITY BUILT INTO IT AS WELL. LOOK AT FIRST OFF I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST. IN FACT BRUCE BECAUSE THE ONE THING YOU CAN BE GUARANTEED IF YOU SAY SOMETHING CAN'T BE ACTIVE WILL BE THEN YOU'LL LOOK SILLY- I THINK. THERE IS SECURITY YOU KNOW. TO BE CLEAR IT'S NOT JUST A PROPOSAL YOU KNOW THERE ARE STANDARDS THAT ARE OUT THERE THERE ARE COMPANIES LIKE APPLE WORKING. TO ACTUALLY EMBED THIS IN THE WALLET- YOU KNOW SMARTPHONES- THE TSA SAID THEY'RE GONNA START ACCEPTING THEM SOME OF YOUR NEIGHBORING STATES LIKE. UTAH AND ARIZONA. HAVE STARTED TO ROLL THEM OUT- SO IT IS YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW. CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE SOME EFFORTS UNDERWAY I'M JUST NOT FAMILIAR WITH THEM- BUT IT IS. YOU KNOW BACKED BY. YOU KNOW. PRETTY STRONG STANDARDS AND- IN AND HACKABLE BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF SECURITY WITH THAT I MEAN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE HAVE TODAY- I TAKE IT YOU KNOW IT'S- THE DRUG ISSUE. HOW DO I SAY THIS IF YOU PUT MORE SECURITY FOCUSED ON THAT. THEN YOU'LL SEE MORE ATTACKERS COME AFTER IT. I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS TRUE IS WE INNOVATE AND SECURITY AND THEN THE ATTACKERS TRY TO CATCH UP WITH US WE HAVE TO INNOVATE AGAIN BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS LIKE. THE MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER COULD BE CHANGED OR COULD NOT BE CHANGED ON YOUR PROPOSAL. I THINK THE NUMBER IS ACTUALLY IRRELEVANT IN SOME CASES AND THAT THE DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER IS JUST AN IDENTIFIER JUST LIKE THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. SHOW SSA WILL LET YOU CHANGE YOUR SSN TODAY. IF YOU CAN SHOW THAT IT'S BEEN BREACHED AND YOU KNOW THINGS ARE YOU HAVE TO HIT A CERTAIN THRESHOLD- THERE ARE WAYS YOU CAN CHANGE IT WITH THE S. TO STAY I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DM VIS HANDLE IT. I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY YOU COULD NOT CHANGE YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE IDENTIFIER NUMBER. BUT WHAT. DIVISION I'M REALLY LAYING OUT IS HOW DO WE GET AWAY FROM WE'RE KNOWING THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY MEANS ANYTHING. IT JUST BECOMES A MEANINGLESS NUMBER THAT'S ONLY GOOD FOR HELPING UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHICH GERMANY GRANTED ME AND WHICH IS SOMEBODY WHO LIVES YOU KNOW IN SACRAMENTO OR LA. WHO HAPPENS TO YOU KNOW HAVE MY NAME ALL UP THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY THING THESE NUMBERS ARE GOOD FOR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IT'S SOMETHING I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING PROPOSAL SOMETHING ON MY STAFF AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT IN AND GET A BETTER HANDLE ON SORT OF. THE SCOPE AND VISION YOU HAVE A- IT'S CERTAINLY A THOUGHTFUL PROPOSAL- I HAVE DISLIKED TWO MORE QUESTIONS ERE REAL QUICKLY- AND THE FIRST IS GOING BACK TO FINANCIAL FRAUD WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY. THE MAIN AREA OF MY FOCUS- WHAT DO. THINK I. THIS COULD BE. I IT AND- IS. OR GRANT. REALLY ANY THAT- OF MULTI THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO. ME AND MY STAFF- THERE ANYTIME SOMEONE WANTS TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT. AND ANY KIND OF CREDIT OR OTHERWISE FINANCIAL. ACCOUNT IN MY NAME AND IDENTITY THAT THAT WE HAVE MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION THE SAME WAY WE DO WHEN I WANT TO OPEN A GOOGLE MAIL ACCOUNT- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SEE IS MEANINGFULLY. DETERRENT TO. IDENTITY FRAUD IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COMES WITH DRAWBACKS- ANY COMMENTARY HERE WOULD BE APPRECIATED- IS AUSTIN. SIR I WELL WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT. ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS BIOMETRICS AND DO A LOT THAT OCCASION- WHICH I USE ALL EVERY DAY IN OUT MULTIPLE WAYS TO- ENTER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DATABASE. I TOOK OVER MY CELL PHONE THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND AT THIS TIME USING A TOOL LIKE THAT I THANK CATION OR BIOMETRICS. ARE STILL RELATIVELY SAFE. I JUST UNDERSTAND THAT MAY BE A BRIDGE TOO FAR WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE AVERAGE INTO INDIVIDUALS. EVERY DAY- ABILITY TO CONDUCT COMMERCE IN A SECURE WAY. SO THE TICKET IS SIMPLY YES I DO THINK THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT YES I DO THINK THAT THAT IS PART OF THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE- MUCH LIKE WE ALL PREDICTED. THAT TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE WOULD BE ADAPTING TO REMOTE WORK A CRISIS PUSHED US TO LEARN HOW TO ADAPT WITH THAT VERY QUICKLY. I THE ONLY PRESENCE OF IDENTITY THEFT IS IN A CRIMINAL PERSPECTIVE. IS A CRISIS. AND WE'VE SEEN SO MUCH OF IT THAT UNFORTUNATELY I FEEL THAT- I IT'S NOT TAKEN AS SERIOUSLY AS PERHAPS IT SHOULD. BUT I HOPE I ANSWERED THAT QUESTION I DO THINK IT IS THE FUTURE UNLIKE SIDE PERHAPS MISTER GRANT- AND THE OTHER PANELISTS. I'M VERY FOCUSED ON. ARE THERE ENOUGH- SOPHISTICATED DETECTIVES ON THE STREET THAT I CAN JUST ACTUALLY. FILE IS SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR IDENTITY THEFT FRAUD CASE SO THAT'S WHERE MY DAY TO DAY AND THE FOCUS OF THE GENERAL YOU KNOW INSURING THAT WE HAVE VERY HIGHLY TRAINED SOPHISTICATED LAW ENFORCEMENT. IS WHERE MY DAY TO DAY. BUT ANECDOTALLY AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR TWENTY YEARS. I DO SEE THE CRISIS PUSHING US TO BIOMETRICS. AND AUTHENTICATION BUT I REALLY THINK I HAVE MISTER GRANT MISS ALASKA'S AT MR ALLMAN. THEY ACTUALLY ARE WORKING IN THAT KIND OF POLICY LEVEL OF WHAT IS PRACTICAL. I DON'T I HOPE THAT HELPS SOME MISTER CHAIRMAN IT DOES VERY MUCH THANK YOU MY SON IS ABOUT HIS HEAD OR HAND UP IN AS AS MISTER. GRANT SO LET'S START WITH MISS ALASKA'S. I GUESS I WANT ADD THE- WE HAVE THE I. TERZI IS ENCOURAGED EVERYONE TO SIGN UP FOR MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ON ALL OF THEIR ACCOUNTS WHEREVER IT'S AVAILABLE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PUBLIC ADOPTING IT EVEN MORE WIDELY THAN THEY ALREADY ARE THAT BEING SAID TO MAKE IT MANDATORY WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT THAT IS GOING TO CREATE ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES FOR A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. AND SO BEFORE YOU COULD MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS MANDATORY THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AHEAD OF TIME- YOU KNOW IN MY PERFECT WORLD YES. MFA WOULD BE MANDATORY WITH IT ALL JUST HAVE TO USE IT BECAUSE IT IT HAS. SO ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT SIMPLY DON'T ENGAGE DIGITALLY IN IN THAT MANNER THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO HOW TO THEY WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND ADDITIONALLY WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE TRULY EVEN THE ONES THAT HAVE OPTED IN. TRULY NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY CANNOT SURE THAT COAT HOW VITAL IT IS THAT THEY DON'T SHARE THAT CODE AND THEY ARE LOSING ACCESS TO THEIR ACCOUNTS WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WE'VE TALKED TO IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE. I THINK I JUST LOOKED AT THE STATS IT WAS. TOUGH FORTY ONE HUNDRED. ADJUSTED FOR GOOGLE VOICE AND I THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER COUPLE THOUSAND FOR INSTAGRAM SO IT'S PRIMARILY ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT IT. WE WOULD HAVE BEFORE WE START MAKING SOMETHING TRULY COMPULSORY WE HAVE WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE OTHER PARTS ADDRESSED THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT AS WELL AS THE- IN ACCESSIBILITY AND THE BARRIERS TO ACCESS THAT IT WOULD CREATE FOR A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. THANK YOU MISS ALASKA'S MISTER GRANT. YES I I'VE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE MFA SPACED A REALLY LONG TIME- A LOT OF MY FOCUS WHEN I WAS AT AND THIS WAS PROMOTING THE ADOPTION OF MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH BETTER STANDARDS THAT COULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DEPLOY. AND T. TO MISS CLASS BECAUSE IT'S ONE I THINK THIS IS BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HAS BEEN- A LOT OF THE FIRST GENERATION. MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION WE'VE SEEN HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY. I THINK WHAT I AFFECTIONATELY CALL SECURITY-WE NEED BECAUSE I AM ONE- BUT IT'S BEEN FOCUSED ON THE WAY THAT WOULD ADD SECURITY IN A WAY THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY DETRACT FROM USER EXPERIENCE. SO EVERYBODY HATES PASSWORDS ARE REALLY REALLY HAS PASSWORD ON MOBILE DEVICES. BUT WHEN WE'RE TELLING YOU WHILE YOUR NEW AUTHENTICATION CEREMONY IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PASSWORD AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TEXT YOU A CODE YOU'RE GOING TO FISH OUT A TOKEN AND ENTER A SECOND PASSWORD. NOBODY'S REALLY INTO THAT- AND SO WHILE TURNING ON MFA IS PROBABLY THE BEST PIECE OF ADVICE I CAN GIVE TO ANYBODY WHO'S WATCHING THIS HEARING OR ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. IN TERMS OF HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THE INDUSTRY IS JUST NOW STARTING TO DO SOME WORK AND HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY YOU KNOW MAKE MFA SOMEHING THAT IS JUST BUILT IN RATHER THAN BOLTED ON- AND THERE I'M ACTUALLY REALLY BULLISH AND I THINK WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF. NOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS AND IT'S BECOME A LITTLE CLICHE BUT I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING CLOSE TO KILLING THE PASSWORD OR AT LEAST BEING ABLE TO- I MEAN WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. SO THERE IS A STANDARDS BODY- WHICH I'M A SERVICE ADVISER TO CALL THE FIDO ALLIANCE FIGHTER STANDS FOR FAST IDENTITY ONLINE. MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED COMPANIES FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE IN SECURITY BANKING PAYMENTS HEALTHCARE BY THE GOVERNMENTS THERE AS WELL ALL WORKING AND HOW CAN YOU ACTUALLY IN BAD. PASSWORD LIST AUTHENTICATION. AND YOUR DEVICE AS OPPOSED TO HAVE TO BE SOME. THAT'S GONNA BE BOLTED ON AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. IS INSTEAD OF A PASSWORD WHICH IS A KNOWLEDGE BASE FACTOR. AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S YOU KNOW THE FIRST FACTOR CAN BE UNLOCKED MY PHONE. BACK IN BIOMETRIC ONLY ON THIS DEVICE YOUKNOW. AND THEN THAT'S IT UNLOCKS A CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY PAIR THAT CAN BE USED BEHIND THE SCENES TO LOG ME IN IN A WAY. THAT'S FRANKLY MUCH MORE SECURE THAN. YOU KNOW THAT EVEN WHEN TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE ONE TIME PASSCODES THAT ARE GETTING FISH THESE DAYS. THOSE ATTACKS ARE GETTING AUTOMATED LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE BY BOTS. YOU'RE THE FIRST GENERATION MFA WE HAD IS NOT FISHABLE- BUT THE NEW FIGHTER STANDARDS ARE NOT IN SO YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE. THE WHITE HOUSE JUST. ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO. FINALIZED IN TO- STRATEGY DOCUMENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT SAYING YOU'RE GONNA USE PHISHING RESISTANT AUTHENTICATION ONLY FOR MSA. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THE LEGACY STUFF ANYMORE. AND POINTING TO THE FACT THAT THE STANDARDS LIKE IF I DON'T HAVE BEEN BUILT INTO A LOT OF DEVICES BY. ACTUALLY EVERY YOU KNOW HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURER I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO REALLY START TO CHANGE THINGS GOING FORWARD. NAME ADDRESS. MY LAST QUESTION- YOU KNOW GET I THINK THIS IS IN YOUR BLUEPRINT- ACTUALLY MISTER GRANT- BUT- I RECALL. SOMEWHERE IN IN ONE OF THE TESTS MEASURE THE BLUEPRINT IT WAS STATED THAT. THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS BAKED INTO OUR CODES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO IN AND REMOVE SUCH. RELIANCE ON SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TO ALTERNATIVES. SUCH AS THE MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU PROPOSE- IS ANYONE HAVE YOU DONE ELSE'S OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AT THE STATE LEVEL IF WE WERE TO TRY TO. DO WHAT YOU'RE TALING ABOUT. WHERE IN THE STATE CODE WOULD WE POTENTIALLY NEED TO REMOVE- REFERENCES AND RELIANCE ON SUCH SCARY NUMBERS OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD LOOK INTO FOR US. I HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT AND I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE OF CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW LAWS AND REGULATIONS- ON THE TOPICS IT TO KNOW- BUT- THIS IS ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WE MADE. IN OUR POLICY BLUEPRINT WHICH WAS IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN WE WERE. WRITING THIS BLUEPRINT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OUR CONFERENCE ROOM. WITH YOU KNOW OUR MEMBERS AND I ASK COMPANIES WHY IS. TIME I SEE A BREACH HAPPENS SSNS ARE LOST WHAT DO YOU HAVE THESE FOUR IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THE ANSWER WAS. WELL A LOT OF TIMES WE HAVE THEM BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TOLD US WE HAD TO. YOUR PARTICULAR IN FINANCIAL SERVICES BUT WE ACTUALLY DID SOME ANALYSIS AT LEAST LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. I THINK WE FOUND NINETEEN DIFFERENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT SAID. YOU KNOW COMPANIES HAVE TO COLLECT AND RETAIN SSNS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES SOME OF THEM MADE A LOT OF SENSE. OTHERS I THINK THERE WAS ONE. THE COAST GUARD SAYS IF YOU'RE REGISTERING A BOAT OVER. FORTY YOU'RE DONATING BLOOD YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN ACCESS AND PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TRACK YOU DOWN IF THERE'S A PROBLEM- SO I DO THINK IT COULD BE WORSE- WE'VE NEVER DONE AN ANALYSIS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE SOME WORK. BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. BETTER REQUIRING THE ASSISTANCE YOU MAY BE OVER USED IN PLACES WHERE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE. THANK YOU MR GRANT- THANK YOU PANELISTS- SENATOR ALAN YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NO I'M I'M AS I SAID THE NUMBER OF YOU HAVE ANY HAVE ANY CLOSING REMARKS THAT YOU LIKE TO MAKE. THE STOCK.
