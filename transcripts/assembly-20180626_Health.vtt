FACE IN CALIFORNIA THE FIRST

00:31:11.403 --> 00:31:15.507 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS ACCESS TO TREATMENT.

00:31:13.739 --> 00:31:16.308 region:rollup2
NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:31:15.507 --> 00:31:18.143 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CALIFORNIA YOUNG PEOPLE

00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:18.977 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND

00:31:18.143 --> 00:31:19.878 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN REPORTED THAT THEY

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:20.946 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:22.247 region:rollup2
BUT DID NOT GET AS YOU DE

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:25.117 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:25.584 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUR HUNDRED

00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:26.985 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THOUSAND YOUNG

00:31:25.584 --> 00:31:28.387 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN THE AGE OF

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:30.155 region:rollup2
TWELVE AND TWENTY FIVE MISUSED

OPIOIDS AND SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS

00:31:30.155 --> 00:31:34.426 region:rollup2
SUCH AS FENTANYL.

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:37.262 region:rollup2
AND THOSE FENTANYL'S ARE ADDING

00:31:34.426 --> 00:31:38.263 region:rollup2
A TWIST IN A STORY IN THAT IT IS

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:40.298 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS IT IS THAT.

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:41.900 region:rollup2
OUR PEOPLE ARE DYING.

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:43.335 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A SECOND FUNDAMENTAL

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.070 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS

00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:47.706 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO TREATMENT ALONE IS NOT

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.974 region:rollup2
ENOUGH JACK FOR EXAMPLE CYCLE IN

00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:50.409 region:rollup2

00:31:51.343 --> 00:31:55.213 region:rollup2
THAT DIDN'T USE EVIDENCE BASED

00:31:53.145 --> 00:31:56.815 region:rollup2
BACK BEST PRACTICES.

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:58.316 region:rollup2
NON EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS

00:31:56.815 --> 00:31:59.518 region:rollup2
FAILED HIM THAT COULD HAVE COST

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:00.986 region:rollup2
HIM HIS LIFE.

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:34.085 region:rollup2
WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:34.085 region:rollup2
OFFICE THAT DOES TREATMENT TO

00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:36.154 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT.

00:37:36.221 --> 00:37:39.991 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO PREVENTION

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.559 region:rollup2
WITHOUT.

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:42.827 region:rollup2
HEMINGWAY TO TREATMENT FOR

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:44.195 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO THEATER EARLY AND A

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:45.530 region:rollup2
PASSION ARE FRENCH AND DOESN'T

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:46.931 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.233 region:rollup2
FOR THE SAME THING WHEN PEOPLE

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:49.767 region:rollup2
DRIVE IN THE PEOPLE WHO.

00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:51.236 region:rollup2
IN THE TREATMENT COMMUNITY AND

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:52.637 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT NOT NEED.

00:37:51.236 --> 00:37:54.606 region:rollup2
THE DEPTH THE TREATMENT THEY

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:55.840 region:rollup2
OFFER BUT THEY CAN GET THE EARLY

00:37:54.606 --> 00:37:57.342 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION THE SCHOOLS.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.377 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY THE BILL SO THEY

00:37:57.342 --> 00:38:01.012 region:rollup2
SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:03.148 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE STAND

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:04.883 region:rollup2
THE LOANS LITTLE FILO.

00:38:03.148 --> 00:38:06.417 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY WORKED

00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:07.852 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.286 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD WE DON'T SET

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:10.522 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR EARLY

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:11.923 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION.

00:38:10.522 --> 00:38:13.424 region:rollup2
WE SET STANDARDS FOR TREATMENT

00:38:11.923 --> 00:38:14.759 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A CRITICAL THING

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.860 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S TOTALLY MISSING

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:18.296 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.431 region:rollup2
DOING TREATMENT FOR KIDS.

00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:23.635 region:rollup2
OKAY SO IT IS THE IDEA THAT

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:26.805 region:rollup2
THOUGH THIS WOULD BE THE THE

00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:27.906 region:rollup2
VESSEL TO HELP SHAPE PROP SIXTY

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:29.407 region:rollup2
FOUR FUNDING.

00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:31.009 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WE OPENED TO THAT WOULD

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:32.143 region:rollup2
BE LOOKING AT SENATOR?

00:38:31.009 --> 00:38:33.645 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:35.046 region:rollup2
THAT PASSED THE CONTINUE I THINK

00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:37.982 region:rollup2
THIS PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK TO

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:38.616 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE AND SORT OF MAKE

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.484 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY

00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:39.951 region:rollup2
--

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:42.620 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S THE

00:38:39.951 --> 00:38:44.222 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION YOU NEED TO GO ON I

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.924 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE WORKING GROUP

00:38:44.222 --> 00:38:48.026 region:rollup2
WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS I THINK IS

00:38:45.924 --> 00:38:48.626 region:rollup2
A PRAGMATIC STEP TO TRY TO HELP

00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:49.627 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE ALL OF THE PROGRAMS

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:50.461 region:rollup2
OUT THERE.

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:52.630 region:rollup2
SO.

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:54.065 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE THIS AS A HIERARCHAL

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.532 region:rollup2
THING I SEE IT AS AN INTEGRATED

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:55.934 region:rollup2
THING.

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:57.669 region:rollup2
FAIR ENOUGH HE KNOWS I KNOW IS A

00:38:55.934 --> 00:38:58.970 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT BUT SIMILAR TO

00:38:57.669 --> 00:39:02.540 region:rollup2
OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:04.275 region:rollup2
POT OF MONEY SCARCE POT LOT A

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.210 region:rollup2
GREAT IDEAS AND A LOT OF A

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:07.412 region:rollup2
COMPETITIONS WAS TO MAKE SURE

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.847 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:07.412 --> 00:39:11.916 region:rollup2

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:13.084 region:rollup2

THE HEALTH SIDE WHICH ISN'T A

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:22.660 region:rollup2
BAD THING REPORTS THE HEALTH

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.863 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:27.899 region:rollup2
BUT ON THE PREVENTION SIDE THERE

00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:29.200 region:rollup2
WASN'T A LOT OF EDUCATOR AND THE

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:30.268 region:rollup2

00:49:26.931 --> 00:49:31.635 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE IT

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:33.404 region:rollup2
MAY CLARIFY THE ISSUE --

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:35.339 region:rollup2
WHEN THE A CA WAS IMPLEMENTED WE

00:49:33.404 --> 00:49:37.107 region:rollup2
MET WITH OUR ACTUARIES?

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:38.509 region:rollup2
AND USE TO FEDERAL CALCULATOR TO

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:39.710 region:rollup2
TRY TO CREATE SMALL GROUP

00:49:38.509 --> 00:49:41.812 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS THAT WOULD MEET THE

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.079 region:rollup2
METAL LEVER LEVELS IN NEAR THE

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.647 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:45.616 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS.

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:47.318 region:rollup2
DOING SO PROVED IMPOSSIBLE

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:49.854 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:50.821 region:rollup2
COPAYS THAT FAR EXCEEDED 50% OF

00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:52.723 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL COST OF SERVICE TO

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:54.558 region:rollup2
THE PLAN.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:56.827 region:rollup2
SO WE RECEIVED AN EXEMPTION AND

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:57.828 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO ALTERNATE PLANS FOR

00:49:56.827 --> 00:50:00.631 region:rollup2
SMALL GROUPS AND BOTH OF THEM

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:02.833 region:rollup2
EXCEED 90% IN VALUE.

00:50:00.631 --> 00:50:04.935 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY RICH PLANS.

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:06.036 region:rollup2
SO SIMPSON IS UNIQUE.

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:07.905 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT ANY BETTER OR ANY

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:09.740 region:rollup2
WORSE THAN ANY CALIFORNIA BASED

00:50:07.905 --> 00:50:11.442 region:rollup2

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:14.838 region:rollup2

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:16.106 region:rollup2
FOR ME FINANCIALLY.

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.540 region:rollup2

ON THIS UNDERTAKING LEAD.

01:32:56.538 --> 01:32:59.707 region:rollup2
WE ESTABLISHED A LINE OF

THE OUTCOME.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:08.483 region:rollup2
I'D IMPROVES THE CHANCES FOR THE

FIRST A COMMUNITY SUPPORTS SP

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.604 region:rollup2
ELEVEN FIFTY TWO WE BELIEVE THAT

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:31.573 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL RELEASES SHOULD DROP

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:32.607 region:rollup2

01:33:34.242 --> 01:33:36.978 region:rollup2

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:41.749 region:rollup2
IN CASES WHERE THE PATIENT HAS

HEALTH ISSUES.

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:47.522 region:rollup2
THEY MUST BE DIRECTED TO

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.691 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE CARE RATHER THAN AN

01:33:47.522 --> 01:33:51.426 region:rollup2

01:44:20.588 --> 01:44:23.224 region:rollup2
DISAGREE ON THIS BILL THAT

CHANGE WHAT IS ALREADY KIND OF

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:38.072 region:rollup2
IN STATUTE.

01:44:36.437 --> 01:44:39.907 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THE NOT PATIENT

PUT THAT INTO THE BILL AT THIS

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:56.056 region:rollup2

SECOND BY MATTEL YEAR CURRY --

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:10.738 region:rollup2
I JUST A QUESTION OF THE

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:12.540 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION --

I'M FOR GOING TO PLUG THE AUTHOR

01:45:14.208 --> 01:45:16.310 region:rollup2
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IS

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:18.012 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:19.680 region:rollup2
HEARING FROM MR MCCARTY NOW HE'S

01:45:18.012 --> 01:45:20.815 region:rollup2
WHERE HE DID TEN YEARS AGO THIS

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.916 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEMS GET ANY BETTER

01:45:20.815 --> 01:45:23.250 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I WOULD ARGUE IS

01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:25.186 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GETTING WORSE.

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:26.921 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU FEW SAID WE NEED

01:45:25.186 --> 01:45:28.556 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WHATEVER.

01:45:26.921 --> 01:45:29.890 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T HEAR SOLUTIONS ARE

01:45:28.556 --> 01:45:31.759 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES DO YOU HAVE AN

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:32.993 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE FOR A SOLUTION THAT

01:45:31.759 --> 01:45:33.994 region:rollup2
YOU COULD OFFER HERE BECAUSE I'M

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:34.962 region:rollup2
NOT ON THE HEARING THAT I'M JUST

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:37.798 region:rollup2
HEARING.

01:45:34.962 --> 01:45:39.300 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T DO IT.

01:45:37.798 --> 01:45:41.302 region:rollup2
WELL WE THINK THAT WE HAVE

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:43.504 region:rollup2
WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE

01:45:41.302 --> 01:45:44.138 region:rollup2
AUTHORS OFFICE AND THE BILL'S

01:45:43.504 --> 01:45:47.007 region:rollup2
SPONSORS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH

01:45:44.138 --> 01:45:49.243 region:rollup2
--

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:50.744 region:rollup2
THE FAULT THE INTENT OF THE BILL

01:45:49.243 --> 01:45:53.013 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TO CREATE A HOMELESS

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:55.182 region:rollup2
PATIENT DISCHARGE POLICY OUR

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:56.984 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS WORK UNDER DISCHARGED

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:58.586 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND WE HAVE AGREED.

01:45:56.984 --> 01:46:00.221 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS A UNIQUE ENOUGH

01:45:58.586 --> 01:46:02.289 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT ISN'T GOING AWAY

01:46:00.221 --> 01:46:03.757 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS TO BE GROWING THAT WE

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:06.293 region:rollup2
NEED TO CREATE THAT HOMELESS.

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:09.663 region:rollup2
PATIENT DISCHARGE POLICY I THINK

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:12.399 region:rollup2
AMANDA CAN CAN SPEAK TO JUST HOW

01:46:09.663 --> 01:46:14.735 region:rollup2
GRAVE THE ISSUE HAS BECOME AND

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:17.838 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR HOSPITALS --

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:19.907 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:21.542 region:rollup2
IN ORDER FOR HOSPITALS TO

01:46:19.907 --> 01:46:23.344 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK THAT

01:46:21.542 --> 01:46:25.012 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING AND AMANDA DOES

01:46:23.344 --> 01:46:26.413 region:rollup2
THIS WORK EVERYDAY IN HER

01:46:25.012 --> 01:46:29.883 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL?

01:46:26.413 --> 01:46:32.086 region:rollup2
WE NEED MORE RESOURCES FUNDED

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:33.520 region:rollup2
AND APPROPRIATE IN THE COMMUNITY

01:46:32.086 --> 01:46:35.856 region:rollup2
TO HELP US WHEN WE'RE READY TO

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.858 region:rollup2
DISCHARGE THAT PERSON WHO NEEDS

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:39.894 region:rollup2
RESPITE CARE OR TEMPORARY

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:41.395 region:rollup2
SHELTER OR EVEN A PATHWAY TO

01:46:39.894 --> 01:46:42.730 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:46:41.395 --> 01:46:44.865 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETHING HOSPITALS ARE

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:46.667 region:rollup2
WILLING AND ARE CURRENTLY TRYING

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:48.369 region:rollup2
TO DO BUT WE NEED ADDITIONAL

01:46:46.667 --> 01:46:50.404 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY AND

01:46:48.369 --> 01:46:52.273 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE BILL --

01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:59.647 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD SHOULD CALL OUT THAT

01:46:52.273 --> 01:47:01.849 region:rollup2
MEET.

01:46:59.647 --> 01:47:03.884 region:rollup2
I ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

01:47:01.849 --> 01:47:06.153 region:rollup2
SEE AS THE BEST JOB THAT WE

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:07.955 region:rollup2
COULD POSSIBLY DO EVERYDAY IS TO

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:10.391 region:rollup2
SET UP A GREAT RESOURCE LIST AND

01:47:07.955 --> 01:47:11.992 region:rollup2
GET SOME CONNECTIONS AND PROVIDE

01:47:10.391 --> 01:47:12.993 region:rollup2
A WARM HAND OFF TO AGENCIES.

01:47:11.992 --> 01:47:14.795 region:rollup2
WHERE WE THINK WE'RE

01:47:12.993 --> 01:47:16.297 region:rollup2
FACILITATING THE BEST CASE

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:17.998 region:rollup2
SCENARIO PLAN FOR THE PATIENT

01:47:16.297 --> 01:47:19.500 region:rollup2
PROVIDING MADS PROVIDING

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:21.268 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT --

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:23.037 region:rollup2
THE TRANSPORTATION.

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:25.306 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:47:23.037 --> 01:47:26.907 region:rollup2
PATIENT WHO MAY HAVE A HISTORY

01:47:25.306 --> 01:47:28.442 region:rollup2
OF TRAUMA OR

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:31.278 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALIZATION.

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:33.147 region:rollup2
AND WE RUN INTO --

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:34.381 region:rollup2
PATIENTS THAT LEAVE BEFORE WE

01:47:33.147 --> 01:47:34.982 region:rollup2
CAN COMPLETE THE PLAN --

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:38.452 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE GREAT

01:47:34.982 --> 01:47:40.120 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE. TWO NAVY WHERE IF WE

01:47:38.452 --> 01:47:41.288 region:rollup2
HAD SOMEONE ON THE RECEIVING END

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.756 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE WE CAN

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:44.491 region:rollup2
PARTNER.

01:47:42.756 --> 01:47:45.859 region:rollup2
IN CENTRAL ISAM SUPPORT OUT IN

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:47.661 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY WITH EITHER

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:49.697 region:rollup2
SHELTER AGENCIES OR COUNTY

01:47:47.661 --> 01:47:50.965 region:rollup2
AGENCIES.

01:47:49.697 --> 01:47:52.499 region:rollup2
THERE THERE ARE --

01:47:50.965 --> 01:47:53.067 region:rollup2
MOMENTS THAT SOMETIMES WE JUST

01:47:52.499 --> 01:47:54.902 region:rollup2
SIMPLY CAN'T CAPTURE IN THE

01:47:53.067 --> 01:47:56.704 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL.

01:47:54.902 --> 01:47:58.005 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS THAT IS ONE OF

01:47:56.704 --> 01:48:00.040 region:rollup2
THE AREAS WHERE I COULD SEE A

01:47:58.005 --> 01:48:01.475 region:rollup2
SOLUTION HAPPENING IS HOSPITALS

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:03.344 region:rollup2
COLLABORATING.

01:48:01.475 --> 01:48:04.778 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:48:03.344 --> 01:48:06.580 region:rollup2
AFTER THE DISCHARGED OR EVEN

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:07.648 region:rollup2
ONCE A PATIENT YOU KNOW IF THEY

01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:09.416 region:rollup2
LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A

01:48:07.648 --> 01:48:12.553 region:rollup2
DISCHARGE PLAN --

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:13.854 region:rollup2
SO WE COULD FOSTER SOME SUCCESS.

01:48:12.553 --> 01:48:16.523 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE SEE AS A

01:48:13.854 --> 01:48:17.758 region:rollup2
BARRIER MOST OFTEN.

01:48:16.523 --> 01:48:19.093 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T THERE PROGRAM AT SOME

01:48:17.758 --> 01:48:20.194 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE HOSPITAL'S REXY

01:48:19.093 --> 01:48:22.262 region:rollup2
DOING CHARITY CARE AND

01:48:20.194 --> 01:48:23.364 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:24.932 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:48:23.364 --> 01:48:27.835 region:rollup2
VARIATIONS ON THAT THROUGHOUT

01:48:24.932 --> 01:48:29.370 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND AT CURRENT

01:48:27.835 --> 01:48:31.338 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN CHICO WE DON'T HAVE

01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:32.339 region:rollup2
ANY A PROGRAM LIKE THAT AND SO

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.640 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT.

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:34.742 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS ARE DOING DIFFERENT

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.876 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT ARE MEETING

01:48:34.742 --> 01:48:39.847 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT NEEDS FOR HOUSING AND

01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:43.851 region:rollup2
STUFF LIKE THAT --

01:48:39.847 --> 01:48:44.885 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:46.220 region:rollup2
CNN WHICH I TO CLOSE TALK YES

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:46.887 region:rollup2
I'M SURE I WOULD LIKE TO ARM YOU

01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:49.456 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:48:46.887 --> 01:48:50.891 region:rollup2
SINCE I GOT ELECTED IN TWO

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:52.292 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX UP UNTIL NOW.

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:53.761 region:rollup2
WHEN I INTERACT WITH IT WAS IN

01:48:52.292 --> 01:48:54.461 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY OR MY SENATE

01:48:53.761 --> 01:48:55.996 region:rollup2
DISTRICT?

01:48:54.461 --> 01:48:57.364 region:rollup2
THERE IS A INCREASE OF

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:58.766 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS WITHIN OUR

01:48:57.364 --> 01:49:00.501 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WE SEE IT.

01:48:58.766 --> 01:49:02.569 region:rollup2
AND IT SPILLING OVER INTO OUR

01:49:00.501 --> 01:49:05.372 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HOSPITAL'S

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:06.140 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOMS ETCETERA.

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:08.208 region:rollup2
LET ME JUST REITERATE LIKE A

01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:09.343 region:rollup2
SEMI OPEN STATEMENTS.

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.844 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITALS ARE DOING AN

01:49:09.343 --> 01:49:12.079 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLE JOB AND THEY'RE DOING

01:49:10.844 --> 01:49:13.781 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THEY CAN BUT THERE

01:49:12.079 --> 01:49:15.282 region:rollup2
ARE STILL INSTANCES WHERE YOU

01:49:13.781 --> 01:49:17.017 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEBODY IT'S LEFT IN THE

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:18.152 region:rollup2
STREET WITH THEIR HOSPITAL GOWN

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:20.788 region:rollup2
AN IV IN THERE.

01:49:18.152 --> 01:49:21.955 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT HUMANE THIS IS WEIRD

01:49:20.788 --> 01:49:23.457 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY'S

01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:26.193 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT.

01:49:23.457 --> 01:49:27.761 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW WHEN I STARTED TO SIT

01:49:26.193 --> 01:49:30.097 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE SOME CONCERNS BUT

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:31.398 region:rollup2
WE'VE SCALED US BACK WAY WAY

01:49:30.097 --> 01:49:33.133 region:rollup2
BACK TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION

01:49:31.398 --> 01:49:34.168 region:rollup2
I MEAN LET ME ALSO STATE OF WITH

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:35.269 region:rollup2
REGARD TO WHAT.

01:49:34.168 --> 01:49:36.670 region:rollup2
THE THE COMMENT THAT THE DEMAND

01:49:35.269 --> 01:49:37.604 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION.

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:39.873 region:rollup2
THAT YES THE AGREE WITH THE

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:40.541 region:rollup2
DISCHARGE POLICY WHICH IS IN

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:41.208 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WHICH WE ARE GOING TO

01:49:40.541 --> 01:49:43.310 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:49:41.208 --> 01:49:45.546 region:rollup2
YES WE DO NEED MORE RESOURCE

01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:48.015 region:rollup2
AREN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES HERE'S

01:49:45.546 --> 01:49:49.083 region:rollup2

A PHARMACIST FOR MANY MANY YEARS

02:07:17.263 --> 02:07:20.700 region:rollup2
AND DO IT VERY QUICKLY --

02:07:18.998 --> 02:07:22.168 region:rollup2
FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE

02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:23.536 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO ACTUALLY

02:07:22.168 --> 02:07:25.505 region:rollup2
LAST MONTH MY FATHER WAS

02:07:23.536 --> 02:07:27.573 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSED WITH A BRAIN TUMOR

02:07:25.505 --> 02:07:28.641 region:rollup2
FROM MY METASTATIC LUNG CANCER.

02:07:27.573 --> 02:07:31.277 region:rollup2
WHEN HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM HOT

02:07:28.641 --> 02:07:32.245 region:rollup2
ONE HAAS I NOTICED THAT THEY

02:07:31.277 --> 02:07:33.379 region:rollup2
DISCONTINUED ONE OF THE

02:07:32.245 --> 02:07:34.981 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS THAT WAS TO REDUCE

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:36.616 region:rollup2
THE SWELLING IN HIS BRAIN?

02:07:34.981 --> 02:07:37.984 region:rollup2
I AND SO I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:07:36.616 --> 02:07:39.185 region:rollup2
GOT TAKEN CARE WHEN HE WAS

02:07:37.984 --> 02:07:41.120 region:rollup2
READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL OR

02:07:39.185 --> 02:07:43.022 region:rollup2
OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT WERE --

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:44.557 region:rollup2
UNDEAD I SWEAR THEN THAT IT

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:47.026 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE IT MY HEART CAREER

02:07:44.557 --> 02:07:48.461 region:rollup2
GOAL TO TO FIX THIS SOMEHOW.

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:50.163 region:rollup2
MORE RECENTLY MY NINETY YEAR OLD

02:07:48.461 --> 02:07:51.697 region:rollup2

02:07:54.367 --> 02:07:57.470 region:rollup2
THEY DISCONTINUED HER HER MATS

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:59.305 region:rollup2
FOR HER BREAST CANCER THEY WERE

02:07:57.470 --> 02:08:00.439 region:rollup2
ALSO DISCONTINUED SUBSEQUENTLY

02:07:59.305 --> 02:08:01.741 region:rollup2
AND THEN SHE WAS.

02:08:00.439 --> 02:08:03.042 region:rollup2
START ON MULTIPLE --

02:08:01.741 --> 02:08:04.143 region:rollup2
BLOOD PRESSURE MEDS SHE WAS

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:06.178 region:rollup2
NINETY POUNDS SHE WAS ADMITTED

02:08:04.143 --> 02:08:07.046 region:rollup2
FALLS AND I NEEDED TO CORRECT A

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:08.347 region:rollup2
MEDALIST.

02:08:07.046 --> 02:08:09.715 region:rollup2
PERFECT PROFESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:11.284 region:rollup2
I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:12.518 region:rollup2
BEST CARE IS PROVIDED WHEN THE

02:08:11.284 --> 02:08:14.253 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE TEAM WORKS TOGETHER.

02:08:12.518 --> 02:08:15.321 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND NURSES ARE INTENT

02:08:14.253 --> 02:08:16.489 region:rollup2
ON STABILIZING THE PATIENT AT

02:08:15.321 --> 02:08:17.523 region:rollup2
THE TIME OF ADMISSION TO MAKE

02:08:16.489 --> 02:08:19.125 region:rollup2
SURE WHATEVER CONDITION ARE

02:08:17.523 --> 02:08:21.394 region:rollup2
BEING ADMITTED FOREST IS TAKEN

02:08:19.125 --> 02:08:22.828 region:rollup2
CARE OF PHARMACISTS ARE TRAINED

02:08:21.394 --> 02:08:24.096 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND MEDICATIONS AND

02:08:22.828 --> 02:08:25.331 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE USED IN THAT EVERY

02:08:24.096 --> 02:08:26.532 region:rollup2
MEDICATION ORDER HOUSE TO BE A

02:08:25.331 --> 02:08:26.732 region:rollup2
COMPLETE SENTENCE JUST AS WE

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:28.768 region:rollup2
SPEAK.

02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:29.669 region:rollup2
IN ENGLISH SO WE'VE CONDUCTED A

02:08:28.768 --> 02:08:30.736 region:rollup2
RESEARCH STUDY THAT WAS

02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:31.971 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED IN THE PEER REVIEWED

02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:33.139 region:rollup2
LITERATURE ALONG WITH MANY OTHER

02:08:31.971 --> 02:08:34.507 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR STUDY WE

02:08:33.139 --> 02:08:36.008 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT.

02:08:34.507 --> 02:08:37.643 region:rollup2
PHARMACY STAFF TO COMMIT THAT

02:08:36.008 --> 02:08:40.279 region:rollup2
TOOK A MEDICATION RISK.

02:08:37.643 --> 02:08:41.914 region:rollup2
LEST I RESULTED IN 80% REDUCTION

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:43.249 region:rollup2
IN MEDICATION ERRORS HAD THOSE

02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:44.517 region:rollup2
THERE IS NOT BEEN CORRECTED TO

02:08:43.249 --> 02:08:45.585 region:rollup2
STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE

02:08:44.517 --> 02:08:46.953 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE AN AVERAGE OF THREE

02:08:45.585 --> 02:08:48.187 region:rollup2
AREAS PER PATIENT.

02:08:46.953 --> 02:08:49.655 region:rollup2
OF WHICH ONE POINT TWO WOULD

02:08:48.187 --> 02:08:50.823 region:rollup2
HAVE IN YRIA SERIOUS OR LIFE

02:08:49.655 --> 02:08:52.525 region:rollup2
THREATENING THIS WAS DONE BY

02:08:50.823 --> 02:08:53.859 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN PERRY VIEW OF THE OF

02:08:52.525 --> 02:08:55.428 region:rollup2

DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL HARM.

02:08:55.428 --> 02:08:58.030 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IS THE MEDICATION

IS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT

02:13:03.476 --> 02:13:06.612 region:rollup2
MEDICAL RECORDS ARE NOT THE

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:08.113 region:rollup2

02:13:06.612 --> 02:13:09.815 region:rollup2

IN SUPPORT.

02:15:14.707 --> 02:15:17.276 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON RELATED

02:15:17.276 --> 02:15:20.946 region:rollup2
YEARS STEMMING FROM MY WIFE'S

02:15:20.946 --> 02:15:25.117 region:rollup2
CANCER.

02:15:23.015 --> 02:15:26.218 region:rollup2
WE FACE SKINNER DEAL NOT JUST

02:15:25.117 --> 02:15:28.620 region:rollup2
WITH THE DISEASE BUT WITH AN

02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:31.323 region:rollup2
ARCANE SYSTEM OF LAWS THAT ARE

02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:33.659 region:rollup2
CONFUSING AT BEST.

02:15:31.323 --> 02:15:35.361 region:rollup2

MEDICAL RECORDS FROM PREMATURE

02:15:37.096 --> 02:15:40.833 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTION.

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:43.035 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT DRIVES ME TO THIS

02:15:40.833 --> 02:15:45.838 region:rollup2
DAY WHAT HAPPENS MY WIFE SHOULD

02:15:43.035 --> 02:15:47.940 region:rollup2
NOT HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE.

02:15:45.838 --> 02:15:49.808 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PAY DOCTORS FOR VITAL

02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:52.344 region:rollup2
SERVICE WHICH INCLUDES STORING

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:54.513 region:rollup2
MEDICAL RECORDS.

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:56.015 region:rollup2
WELL CURRENT LAW ALLOWS PATIENTS

02:15:54.513 --> 02:15:58.550 region:rollup2
TO ACCESS THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS

02:15:56.015 --> 02:16:00.219 region:rollup2
MOST WOULD BE SHOCKED TO LEARN.

02:15:58.550 --> 02:16:01.620 region:rollup2
DOCTORS ARE FREE TO SHRED

02:16:00.219 --> 02:16:02.121 region:rollup2
PATIENT RECORDS WITH NO

02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:04.223 region:rollup2

02:16:04.223 --> 02:16:07.726 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF CANCER AND OTHER

02:16:05.891 --> 02:16:09.094 region:rollup2
DISEASE.

02:16:07.726 --> 02:16:12.097 region:rollup2
THAT GO INTO REMISSION FOR

02:16:09.094 --> 02:16:13.832 region:rollup2
PERHAPS DECADES TREATMENT PLANS

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:15.467 region:rollup2
ARE DEPENDENT ON WHAT HAS

02:16:13.832 --> 02:16:17.369 region:rollup2
HAPPENED BEFORE.

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:18.871 region:rollup2
MY WIFE SUFFERED FROM BREAST

02:16:17.369 --> 02:16:20.272 region:rollup2
CANCER TWICE OVER FOURTEEN YEAR

02:16:18.871 --> 02:16:21.840 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

02:16:20.272 --> 02:16:23.909 region:rollup2
WHEN SHE WAS STRICKEN THE SECOND

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:25.944 region:rollup2
TIME I TRY TO RETRIEVE HER

02:16:23.909 --> 02:16:27.713 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL TUMOR SLIDES AND

02:16:25.944 --> 02:16:28.981 region:rollup2
RADIATION RECORDS TO LEARN

02:16:27.713 --> 02:16:30.249 region:rollup2
WHETHER HER CANCER WAS NEW OR

02:16:28.981 --> 02:16:31.717 region:rollup2
RECURRENT?

02:16:30.249 --> 02:16:33.719 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER SHE WAS A CANDIDATE

02:16:31.717 --> 02:16:34.753 region:rollup2
FOR MORE RADIATION.

02:16:33.719 --> 02:16:36.488 region:rollup2
BUT THE SLIDES HAD BEEN

02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:38.757 region:rollup2
DESTROYED AND THE RADIATION

02:16:36.488 --> 02:16:41.160 region:rollup2
RECORDS WERE MISSING.

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:42.628 region:rollup2
IN THE MAD RUSH TO TREAT DOCTORS

02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:44.263 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND MY WIFE BE RADIATED

02:16:42.628 --> 02:16:45.564 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:16:44.263 --> 02:16:47.566 region:rollup2
BUT WITHOUT THE RADIATION

02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:49.201 region:rollup2
RECORDS THERE WAS NO WAY OF

02:16:47.566 --> 02:16:51.937 region:rollup2
KNOWING WHETHER SHE HAD REACHED

02:16:49.201 --> 02:16:52.971 region:rollup2
A LIFETIME MAXIMUM OF RADIATION

02:16:51.937 --> 02:16:54.606 region:rollup2
FROM HER FIRST BATTLES WITH

02:16:52.971 --> 02:16:56.809 region:rollup2
CANCER.

02:16:54.606 --> 02:16:59.645 region:rollup2
RADIATION TREATMENT CAN BE BOTH

02:16:56.809 --> 02:17:01.046 region:rollup2
THE QUEUE OR AND CURSE.

02:16:59.645 --> 02:17:02.614 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE NOTIFICATION

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:04.116 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT IN THIS BILL

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:05.150 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN

02:17:04.116 --> 02:17:06.652 region:rollup2
THE DARK.

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:08.987 region:rollup2
NEVER KNOWING WHETHER THE DOCTOR

02:17:06.652 --> 02:17:10.823 region:rollup2
PATIENT RELATIONSHIP HAS ENDED.

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:12.491 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER THEIR RECORDS EVEN

02:17:10.823 --> 02:17:14.193 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO EXIST.

02:17:12.491 --> 02:17:15.994 region:rollup2
KNOWING ONE PATIENT MEDICAL

02:17:14.193 --> 02:17:17.896 region:rollup2
RECORDS MAY BE DESTROYED.

02:17:15.994 --> 02:17:19.364 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE SAME AS KNOWING

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:21.433 region:rollup2
WHEN PATIENT RECORDS WILL BE

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:23.435 region:rollup2
DESTROYED.

02:17:21.433 --> 02:17:25.170 region:rollup2
IT WAS PURE CHANCE THEN MY

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:27.606 region:rollup2
WIFE'S TUMOR SLIDES WERE

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:29.441 region:rollup2
DESTROYED AND RADIATION RECORDS

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:31.477 region:rollup2
WERE EVENTUALLY FOUND.

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:32.678 region:rollup2
THE CHANCE IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD

02:17:31.477 --> 02:17:33.979 region:rollup2
BE RUNNING HEALTH CARE IN THIS

02:17:32.678 --> 02:17:34.813 region:rollup2

THEY ENCOUNTER THEIR PROVIDERS

02:23:39.177 --> 02:23:41.112 region:rollup2

02:26:22.841 --> 02:26:26.511 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS --

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:28.313 region:rollup2
BECOME GLARINGLY CLEAR TO ME IS

02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:28.780 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS HUGE INCONSISTENCY

02:26:28.313 --> 02:26:30.215 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE MEDICAL

02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:31.716 region:rollup2
PROFESSION AND HOW RECORDS ARE

02:26:30.215 --> 02:26:33.284 region:rollup2
RETAINED.

02:26:31.716 --> 02:26:35.287 region:rollup2
I'M REALLY OLD SCHOOL I KEPT

02:26:33.284 --> 02:26:36.755 region:rollup2
EVERY RECORD FROM EVERY PATIENT

02:26:35.287 --> 02:26:38.623 region:rollup2
EXCEPT THOSE WHO WHO I KNEW HAD

02:26:36.755 --> 02:26:39.858 region:rollup2
TO SEE WERE DECEASED --

02:26:38.623 --> 02:26:40.492 region:rollup2
IN A PERFECT WORLD I THINK

02:26:39.858 --> 02:26:42.360 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE

02:26:40.492 --> 02:26:43.728 region:rollup2
--

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:45.196 region:rollup2

WOULDN'T HAVE THIS ISSUE WE'RE

02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:48.466 region:rollup2
ALSO MOVING INTO THE AGE OF

02:26:46.631 --> 02:26:50.068 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC RECORDS SO STORAGE

02:26:48.466 --> 02:26:52.237 region:rollup2
WILL BE DIFFERENT AND UP

02:26:50.068 --> 02:26:54.773 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY EASIER TO MAINTAIN.

02:26:52.237 --> 02:26:55.440 region:rollup2
AND IT COULD BE A POINT IN THE

02:26:54.773 --> 02:26:57.242 region:rollup2
NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE WHERE WE

02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:59.044 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT

02:26:57.242 --> 02:27:01.446 region:rollup2
IS ELECTRONIC AND IT'S IN THE

02:26:59.044 --> 02:27:03.114 region:rollup2
CLOUD WHERE THE HECK THAT IS --

02:27:01.446 --> 02:27:04.949 region:rollup2
BUT BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN JUST

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:06.551 region:rollup2

ARE EXEMPT UNDER THE BILL AND

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.336 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE COMMITTEE

02:29:37.135 --> 02:29:40.305 region:rollup2
MEMBERS KNOW THAT IT'S THE

02:29:38.336 --> 02:29:42.574 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER HIMSELF

02:29:40.305 --> 02:29:43.074 region:rollup2

OF A GROUP.

02:29:43.074 --> 02:29:46.478 region:rollup2
THAT DECIDES WHETHER MEDICAL

02:29:51.216 --> 02:29:54.219 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE

AND HOPEFULLY THE RARE CASE

02:30:13.004 --> 02:30:16.641 region:rollup2
SAVES THE LIFE I THINK THOSE

02:30:15.039 --> 02:30:18.076 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THAT

02:30:16.641 --> 02:30:18.810 region:rollup2
INCONVENIENCE CERTAINLY ARE WELL

02:30:18.076 --> 02:30:20.144 region:rollup2

THIS BILL WILL PREVENT PROVIDERS

02:32:35.813 --> 02:32:39.083 region:rollup2
FROM GAMING THE SYSTEM AS A

02:32:45.323 --> 02:32:49.427 region:rollup2
THIS GAMING OF THE SYSTEM IS

02:32:46.791 --> 02:32:50.495 region:rollup2
HARMFUL AND A COUPLE OF WAYS.

02:32:49.427 --> 02:32:53.164 region:rollup2
IT CAN EXPOSE THE PATIENT TO AN

02:32:50.495 --> 02:32:54.732 region:rollup2
INCREASED SHARE OF COSTS WITH

LOSING COVERAGE IF THE PROVIDER

02:33:00.538 --> 02:33:04.042 region:rollup2
STOPS MAKING THEIR PAYMENTS.

02:33:02.273 --> 02:33:06.477 region:rollup2

ELEVEN FIFTY SIX WE SEE THIS IS

02:33:43.815 --> 02:33:46.217 region:rollup2
A MODEST.

02:33:45.049 --> 02:33:47.552 region:rollup2
BUT IMPORTANT EFFORT TO ADDRESS

02:33:46.217 --> 02:33:50.388 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION THAT WE'VE SEEN

02:33:47.552 --> 02:33:51.956 region:rollup2
OCCUR IN JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS

02:33:50.388 --> 02:33:53.491 region:rollup2
SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA.

02:33:51.956 --> 02:33:54.859 region:rollup2
WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT SOME

02:33:53.491 --> 02:33:55.927 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

02:33:54.859 --> 02:33:58.062 region:rollup2
THE GUARANTEED ISSUE ONCE

02:33:55.927 --> 02:33:59.564 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACA TO STEER

02:33:58.062 --> 02:34:00.998 region:rollup2
PATIENTS INTO COMMERCIAL HEALTH

02:33:59.564 --> 02:34:02.100 region:rollup2

02:34:00.998 --> 02:34:03.868 region:rollup2
BY OFFERING TO PAY FOR THE

02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:05.803 region:rollup2
PATIENTS PREMIUMS WHEN THE

02:34:03.868 --> 02:34:07.605 region:rollup2
PATIENT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:34:05.803 --> 02:34:09.307 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ALLEN MEDICARE.

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:10.608 region:rollup2
THEY DO THIS BECAUSE IT IS IN

02:34:09.307 --> 02:34:12.643 region:rollup2
THEIR FINANCIAL INTEREST TO DO

02:34:10.608 --> 02:34:14.412 region:rollup2
SO THEY KNOW THEY WILL MAKE MUCH

02:34:12.643 --> 02:34:15.146 region:rollup2
MORE FROM INSURANCE PAYMENTS TO

02:34:14.412 --> 02:34:16.647 region:rollup2
OUTWEIGH THE COST OF THE

02:34:16.647 --> 02:34:19.617 region:rollup2
NOW MANY TIMES IS NOT IN THE

02:34:18.683 --> 02:34:20.518 region:rollup2
BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENTS

02:34:19.617 --> 02:34:21.686 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY NOT IN THE BEST

02:34:20.518 --> 02:34:22.887 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF INDIVIDUALS AND

02:34:21.686 --> 02:34:24.222 region:rollup2
SMALL GROUPS STRUGGLING TO PAY

IN THOSE MARKETS.

02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:28.893 region:rollup2

02:34:35.066 --> 02:34:38.703 region:rollup2
CAUSING HUGE BILLS FOR INSURERS

02:34:36.801 --> 02:34:40.204 region:rollup2
AND NOT PROVIDING SUBSTANTIVE

02:34:38.703 --> 02:34:41.939 region:rollup2

02:34:43.107 --> 02:34:46.477 region:rollup2
THAT PRACTICE SO I WILL JUST

02:34:45.176 --> 02:34:48.079 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATE PERHAPS IN ANOTHER

02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:49.247 region:rollup2
AREA OF CONCERN.

02:34:48.079 --> 02:34:51.582 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WITH IN NETWORK

02:34:49.247 --> 02:34:52.450 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS CENTERS.

02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:54.218 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE SEEING

02:34:52.450 --> 02:34:56.154 region:rollup2
OCCURS WHEN THE DIALYSIS CLINIC

02:34:54.218 --> 02:34:57.522 region:rollup2
STAFF FIND PATIENTS WITHIN THEIR

02:34:56.154 --> 02:34:58.890 region:rollup2
CLINICS AND THEN STEER THEM INTO

02:34:57.522 --> 02:35:00.424 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL COVERAGE WHEN THEY

02:34:58.890 --> 02:35:01.626 region:rollup2
WOULD OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO BE

02:35:00.424 --> 02:35:04.662 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OUT WITH

02:35:01.626 --> 02:35:05.897 region:rollup2
NO SHARE OF KOSTER MEDICARE.

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:07.198 region:rollup2
THE DIALYSIS PROVIDER THINK

02:35:05.897 --> 02:35:08.766 region:rollup2
CONNECTS THE PATIENT WITH THE

02:35:07.198 --> 02:35:09.800 region:rollup2
AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WHICH IS

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:11.469 region:rollup2
THE RECIPIENT OF CHARITABLE

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:13.271 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PROVIDER

02:35:11.469 --> 02:35:14.172 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR THE PATIENTS PREMIUM.

02:35:13.271 --> 02:35:16.140 region:rollup2
SO IT'S BASICALLY JUST A PASSED

02:35:14.172 --> 02:35:17.942 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:19.777 region:rollup2
THE DIALYSIS PROVIDER THEN BILLS

02:35:17.942 --> 02:35:22.380 region:rollup2
INSURERS THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE

02:35:19.777 --> 02:35:23.548 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS THAT MEDICARE WOULD PAY.

02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:24.549 region:rollup2
FOR THREE TREATMENTS A WEEK FOR

02:35:23.548 --> 02:35:27.485 region:rollup2
MONTHS OR YEARS ON AND THE

02:35:24.549 --> 02:35:28.819 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE IS OBVIOUS.

02:35:27.485 --> 02:35:29.921 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS NOT JUST A BILLING

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:32.256 region:rollup2
DISPUTE BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS AND

02:35:29.921 --> 02:35:33.324 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS A CENTER LEYVA POINTED

02:35:32.256 --> 02:35:36.294 region:rollup2
OUT THERE ARE SOME REAL HARM TO

02:35:33.324 --> 02:35:38.329 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

02:35:36.294 --> 02:35:39.897 region:rollup2
SO WHAT DOES SQ ELEVEN FIFTY SIX

02:35:38.329 --> 02:35:41.432 region:rollup2
DO TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THE

02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:43.067 region:rollup2
BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES A FINANCIAL

02:35:41.432 --> 02:35:43.801 region:rollup2
INTERESTED THIRD PARTY PAYERS DO

02:35:43.067 --> 02:35:45.703 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT THING BY THEIR

02:35:43.801 --> 02:35:47.405 region:rollup2
PATIENTS BY KEEPING THEM ON

02:35:45.703 --> 02:35:48.773 region:rollup2
COVERAGE FOR A FULL YEAR.

02:35:47.405 --> 02:35:50.441 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN KICKING THEM OFF

02:35:48.773 --> 02:35:52.510 region:rollup2
WHEN HEALTH INSURANCE CAN NO

02:35:50.441 --> 02:35:54.011 region:rollup2
LONGER BE BUILT THEY MUST NOTIFY

02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:55.446 region:rollup2
PATIENTS OF THEIR OPTIONS AND

02:35:54.011 --> 02:35:56.314 region:rollup2
NOT STEER THEM INTO A PARTICULAR

02:35:55.446 --> 02:35:57.849 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:35:56.314 --> 02:35:59.584 region:rollup2
AS WE CURRENTLY CHOIR OF OTHER

02:35:57.849 --> 02:36:00.952 region:rollup2
AGENTS AND BROKERS AND THEY MUST

02:35:59.584 --> 02:36:01.919 region:rollup2
LET HEALTH PLANS KNOW THAT THEY

02:36:00.952 --> 02:36:03.321 region:rollup2
ARE PAYING FOR THESE PREMIUMS

02:36:01.919 --> 02:36:04.455 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER THEY'D MET THESE

02:36:03.321 --> 02:36:05.723 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS.

02:36:04.455 --> 02:36:06.958 region:rollup2
NOW YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THIS

02:36:05.723 --> 02:36:08.226 region:rollup2
BILL WILL FORCE PEOPLE INTO

02:36:06.958 --> 02:36:10.428 region:rollup2
MEDICARE TAKE AWAY THEIR

02:36:08.226 --> 02:36:11.662 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL COVERAGE NOTHING IN

02:36:10.428 --> 02:36:12.863 region:rollup2
THIS BILL.

02:36:11.662 --> 02:36:14.498 region:rollup2
REQUIRES ANYONE TO BE ON

COMMERCIAL COVERAGE.

02:36:19.337 --> 02:36:22.039 region:rollup2
THE BILL SIMPLY TAKES THE

02:36:20.304 --> 02:36:23.708 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR DOING SO

02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:24.976 region:rollup2

02:36:26.444 --> 02:36:30.081 region:rollup2
LOWER.

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:30.881 region:rollup2

WE DO NOT FORESEE HOWEVER

FUNDS HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS ON

02:41:13.397 --> 02:41:17.801 region:rollup2
THE DIALYSIS SIDE NOT ON THE

I THINK IMPROVES UPON THE BILL.

02:41:22.573 --> 02:41:25.242 region:rollup2
IT STILL IS BEYOND ME WHY

02:41:24.942 --> 02:41:26.744 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:41:25.242 --> 02:41:29.613 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATURE.

02:41:26.744 --> 02:41:32.483 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO TAKE WORKERS.

02:41:29.613 --> 02:41:35.619 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE FALLEN ON HARD TIMES?

02:41:32.483 --> 02:41:37.221 region:rollup2

02:41:37.221 --> 02:41:40.824 region:rollup2
PUSH THEM ON TO MEDICARE.

02:41:39.323 --> 02:41:42.593 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.

02:41:40.824 --> 02:41:44.361 region:rollup2
ARE THEN LEFT WITHOUT HEALTH

02:41:42.593 --> 02:41:46.497 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

02:41:44.361 --> 02:41:49.033 region:rollup2
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

02:41:46.497 --> 02:41:50.801 region:rollup2
IT IS IN A UNION TRUST FUND

02:41:49.033 --> 02:41:52.336 region:rollup2
MULTI EMPLOYER TRUST FUND.

02:41:50.801 --> 02:41:54.438 region:rollup2
AND EMPLOYER PAYS A CERTAIN

02:41:52.336 --> 02:41:57.508 region:rollup2
AMOUNT PER HOUR TO A MEMBERS

02:41:54.438 --> 02:41:58.576 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE ACCOUNT.

02:41:57.508 --> 02:42:01.345 region:rollup2
THEY DRAW DOWN THAT ACCOUNT ON A

02:41:58.576 --> 02:42:02.546 region:rollup2
MONTHLY BASIS.

02:42:01.345 --> 02:42:03.747 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY GET TOO IF THEY GET

02:42:02.546 --> 02:42:05.516 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYED AS WE DO AND

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:06.717 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION ON A REGULAR BASIS

02:42:05.516 --> 02:42:08.786 region:rollup2
MY MEMBERS WILL BE OUT OF WORK

02:42:06.717 --> 02:42:10.988 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES A YEAR OR TWO YEARS?

02:42:08.786 --> 02:42:13.424 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY RUN THEIR COUNT DOWN?

02:42:10.988 --> 02:42:14.225 region:rollup2
TO ZERO THEY GET COBRA.

02:42:13.424 --> 02:42:17.127 region:rollup2
MEANING THEY HAVE TO PAY OUT OF

02:42:14.225 --> 02:42:18.262 region:rollup2
THEIR POCKET. TO MAINTAIN THEIR

02:42:17.127 --> 02:42:20.197 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE NOT JUST FOR

02:42:18.262 --> 02:42:22.299 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:42:20.197 --> 02:42:24.034 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THEIR FAMILY.

02:42:22.299 --> 02:42:25.736 region:rollup2
I KNOW OF TWO INSTANCES WHERE

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:27.771 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF MINE HAVE RECEIVED

02:42:25.736 --> 02:42:30.207 region:rollup2
GRANTS THAT HAVE HELPED THEM

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:31.875 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE.

02:42:30.207 --> 02:42:33.210 region:rollup2
NOT FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY

02:42:31.875 --> 02:42:36.046 region:rollup2
COULD GOING TO MEDICARE.

02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:38.082 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THEIR FAMILY.

02:42:36.046 --> 02:42:40.150 region:rollup2
SO IT IS BEYOND ME WHY.

02:42:38.082 --> 02:42:42.653 region:rollup2
IT'S A DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE THAT

02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:44.255 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO FORCE WORKERS.

02:42:42.653 --> 02:42:46.156 region:rollup2
OUT OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE

02:42:44.255 --> 02:42:47.157 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR FAMILIES SO THAT.

02:42:46.156 --> 02:42:48.826 region:rollup2
H. YOU MODES CAN SAVE A FEW

02:42:47.157 --> 02:42:49.827 region:rollup2
MONTHS WORTH THE MONEY.

02:42:48.826 --> 02:42:52.696 region:rollup2
BECAUSE REMEMBER THERE ARE THE

02:42:49.827 --> 02:42:53.364 region:rollup2
CAPTIVE THIRTY MONTHS.

02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:54.732 region:rollup2
BEFORE SOMEBODY WITH ON DIALYSIS

02:42:53.364 --> 02:42:56.800 region:rollup2
GETS PUSHED.

02:42:54.732 --> 02:42:58.102 region:rollup2
I TO MEDICARE.

02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:59.603 region:rollup2
SO IS THAT REALLY WHAT WE WANT

02:42:58.102 --> 02:43:00.738 region:rollup2
TO DO.

02:42:59.603 --> 02:43:01.805 region:rollup2
TAKE HEALTHCARE AWAY FROM

02:43:00.738 --> 02:43:03.540 region:rollup2
FAMILIES KNOW THEY COULD GOING

02:43:01.805 --> 02:43:05.476 region:rollup2
TO MEDI CAL.

02:43:03.540 --> 02:43:06.510 region:rollup2
IF THE SPEND DOWN THEIR ASSETS

02:43:05.476 --> 02:43:07.978 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO TWO THOUSAND

02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:09.213 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

02:43:07.978 --> 02:43:10.848 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY MEMBER

02:43:09.213 --> 02:43:13.350 region:rollup2
IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO SAY

02:43:10.848 --> 02:43:14.818 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE.

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:16.553 region:rollup2
AND SPENT EVERY PENNY OF IT.

02:43:14.818 --> 02:43:17.921 region:rollup2
ON HEALTH CARE.

02:43:16.553 --> 02:43:19.790 region:rollup2
SO YOUR FAMILY CAN GET ON MEDI

02:43:17.921 --> 02:43:21.925 region:rollup2
CAL WHEN YOU COULD JUST BE IN

02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:24.194 region:rollup2
OUR UNION TRUST FUND.

02:43:21.925 --> 02:43:25.729 region:rollup2
UP BLUE SHIELD OR A BLUE CROSS

02:43:24.194 --> 02:43:27.665 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH PLAN THROUGH THOSE

02:43:25.729 --> 02:43:28.732 region:rollup2
REASONS I THINK THIS BILL IS

02:43:27.665 --> 02:43:30.868 region:rollup2
FLAWED ON THE DIALYSIS.

THOUSAND LOW INCOME

02:43:51.388 --> 02:43:54.391 region:rollup2

CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN IN THE

02:44:08.005 --> 02:44:10.407 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:11.775 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:44:10.407 --> 02:44:13.077 region:rollup2
THESE AMENDMENTS WILL ELIMINATE

02:44:11.775 --> 02:44:14.845 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE PROVISIONS THAT

02:44:13.077 --> 02:44:17.247 region:rollup2
WOULD HARM COVERAGE AND CARE FOR

02:44:14.845 --> 02:44:18.515 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DIALYSIS PATIENTS

02:44:17.247 --> 02:44:20.351 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

02:44:18.515 --> 02:44:21.719 region:rollup2
THE SENATE VERSION OF THE BILL.

02:44:20.351 --> 02:44:23.454 region:rollup2
WE THANK EACH MEMBER FOR

02:44:21.719 --> 02:44:24.455 region:rollup2
SPENDING THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE

02:44:23.454 --> 02:44:25.089 region:rollup2
WITH PATIENTS FROM YOUR

DISTRICTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

02:44:25.089 --> 02:44:27.891 region:rollup2
WEEKS.

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:29.293 region:rollup2
WE THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND THE

02:44:27.891 --> 02:44:30.694 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE FOR PUTTING FORTH

02:44:29.293 --> 02:44:32.129 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS TO ELIMINATE THE

02:44:30.694 --> 02:44:33.597 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT PATIENTS

02:44:32.129 --> 02:44:34.631 region:rollup2
RECEIVING CHARITABLE PREMIUM

02:44:33.597 --> 02:44:36.567 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE.

02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:38.669 region:rollup2
MUST FIRST APPLY FOR MEDICARE

02:44:36.567 --> 02:44:39.970 region:rollup2
AND MEDICAID OBVIOUS AND WAIT

02:44:38.669 --> 02:44:41.305 region:rollup2
SIXTY DAYS BEFORE THEY COULD

02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:42.606 region:rollup2
RECEIVE ASSISTANCE.

02:44:41.305 --> 02:44:44.441 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGES THAT

02:44:42.606 --> 02:44:45.576 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ACTIVE GO A LONG WAY

02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:45.876 region:rollup2
IN IMPROVING THE BILL

02:44:45.576 --> 02:44:47.811 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:44:45.876 --> 02:44:49.546 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

02:44:47.811 --> 02:44:51.381 region:rollup2
WE ARE UP WE REMAIN CONCERNED

02:44:49.546 --> 02:44:53.417 region:rollup2
ABOUT ISSUES THAT MAKE IT

02:44:51.381 --> 02:44:55.552 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR US TO SUPPORT THIS

02:44:53.417 --> 02:44:57.621 region:rollup2
BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

02:44:55.552 --> 02:44:59.356 region:rollup2
LET ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR OUR

02:44:57.621 --> 02:45:01.959 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS NOT ABOUT

02:44:59.356 --> 02:45:03.961 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATES WE ADAMANTLY

02:45:01.959 --> 02:45:05.496 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT RACE SHOULD BE

02:45:03.961 --> 02:45:07.164 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED BETWEEN INSURERS AND

02:45:05.496 --> 02:45:09.700 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

02:45:07.164 --> 02:45:11.468 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN IS ABOUT MAINTAINING

02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:13.003 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT BALANCE IN THE SYSTEM

02:45:11.468 --> 02:45:14.671 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:45:13.003 --> 02:45:16.907 region:rollup2
ARE ON DIALYSIS.

02:45:14.671 --> 02:45:18.509 region:rollup2
WHILE WE THINK THAT IT WAS NOT

02:45:16.907 --> 02:45:20.344 region:rollup2
THE INTENTION OF THE COMMITTEE.

02:45:18.509 --> 02:45:22.880 region:rollup2
THE REWRITE POTENTIALLY CAUSES

02:45:20.344 --> 02:45:24.581 region:rollup2
NEW ISSUES FOR PATIENT ACCESS.

02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:25.616 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO

02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:27.017 region:rollup2
LIVE IN INNER CITY AND RURAL

02:45:25.616 --> 02:45:29.186 region:rollup2
AREAS.

02:45:27.017 --> 02:45:31.021 region:rollup2
CHARITABLE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE

02:45:29.186 --> 02:45:32.923 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE OF

02:45:31.021 --> 02:45:34.024 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IN THESE AREAS CANNOT

02:45:32.923 --> 02:45:35.359 region:rollup2
FIND A PLACE TO RECEIVE THEIR

02:45:34.024 --> 02:45:38.929 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:45:35.359 --> 02:45:41.131 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN IS THAT ELEVEN FIFTY

02:45:38.929 --> 02:45:42.332 region:rollup2
SIX SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX AS

02:45:41.131 --> 02:45:43.734 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WRITTEN.

02:45:42.332 --> 02:45:46.236 region:rollup2
COULD LEAD TO THE CLOSURE OF

02:45:43.734 --> 02:45:48.338 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS CENTERS AND THEY ARE

02:45:46.236 --> 02:45:50.240 region:rollup2
FIVE THREATEN PATIENT ACCESS.

02:45:48.338 --> 02:45:52.042 region:rollup2
IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:54.311 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE ANALYZE THIS ISSUE

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:56.613 region:rollup2
BEFORE PASSING LEGISLATION THAT

02:45:54.311 --> 02:45:58.782 region:rollup2
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT THE

02:45:56.613 --> 02:46:00.951 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF CARE FOR SOME OF

02:45:58.782 --> 02:46:03.053 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S MOST MEDICALLY

02:46:00.951 --> 02:46:04.988 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE CITIZENS.

02:46:03.053 --> 02:46:06.490 region:rollup2
I PATIENTS CANNOT GET TO CARE

02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:08.525 region:rollup2
BECOME THE CLINIC IS CLOSE

02:46:06.490 --> 02:46:09.960 region:rollup2
THEY'RE HELPFUL SUFFERED GREATLY

02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:11.628 region:rollup2
AND THE COST OF CARE WILL

02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:13.630 region:rollup2
INCREASE AS THEY WILL BE

02:46:11.628 --> 02:46:14.598 region:rollup2
HOSPITALIZED MORE AND WILL SEEK.

02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:16.366 region:rollup2
ARE CURATIVE CARE AND OTHER

02:46:14.598 --> 02:46:18.001 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS.

02:46:16.366 --> 02:46:20.838 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT THERE

02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:22.172 region:rollup2
IS A LONG HISTORY AND MEDICARE.

02:46:20.838 --> 02:46:24.208 region:rollup2
ABOUT ESTABLISHING A BALANCE

02:46:44.361 --> 02:46:47.898 region:rollup2

02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:49.833 region:rollup2

OF COVERING THIS POPULATION.

02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:12.389 region:rollup2
I WOULD THEREFORE URGE THE

PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT

02:47:21.732 --> 02:47:26.470 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US.

TO PROVIDE CHARITABLE ASSISTANCE

02:47:26.470 --> 02:47:29.106 region:rollup2

03:04:15.845 --> 03:04:17.813 region:rollup2
CAL.

03:04:16.045 --> 03:04:19.382 region:rollup2
THAT IS CORRECT GLAD THAT'S BEEN

03:04:17.813 --> 03:04:20.650 region:rollup2
CLARIFIED --

03:04:19.382 --> 03:04:22.451 region:rollup2
IN I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE

03:04:20.650 --> 03:04:24.153 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION IF ANYONE IF IF

03:04:22.451 --> 03:04:26.355 region:rollup2

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:04:30.459 --> 03:04:34.130 region:rollup2
THAT THE ISSUE HERE.

03:04:32.194 --> 03:04:36.065 region:rollup2
IS THAT PROVIDED THE THE THE

03:04:34.130 --> 03:04:38.401 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

03:04:36.065 --> 03:04:40.970 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS DIALYSIS SERVICES TO

03:04:38.401 --> 03:04:41.504 region:rollup2
BE PROVIDED HAS ALWAYS ASSUMED

03:04:40.970 --> 03:04:42.872 region:rollup2
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE

03:04:41.504 --> 03:04:44.040 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

03:04:42.872 --> 03:04:45.374 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE OUR PUBLIC

03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:47.109 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND

03:04:45.374 --> 03:04:48.644 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE USE THOSE AND THEY

03:04:47.109 --> 03:04:50.613 region:rollup2
WORK WELL FOR MOST PEOPLE.

03:04:48.644 --> 03:04:52.148 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC ASSIST SYSTEM ALSO

03:04:50.613 --> 03:04:53.983 region:rollup2
ASSUMES AND THERE'S A WHOLE

03:04:52.148 --> 03:04:55.785 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION

03:04:53.983 --> 03:04:56.285 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD ALSO BE SOME

03:04:55.785 --> 03:04:57.486 region:rollup2
FOLKS WOULD USE PRIVATE

03:04:56.285 --> 03:04:59.155 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

03:04:57.486 --> 03:05:00.723 region:rollup2
IT TAKES THE COMBINATION OF

03:04:59.155 --> 03:05:02.825 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM

03:05:00.723 --> 03:05:05.127 region:rollup2
WORK WHEN THAT COMBINATION DOES

03:05:02.825 --> 03:05:06.762 region:rollup2
NOT WORK DIALYSIS CENTERS WILL

03:05:05.127 --> 03:05:08.931 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO CLOSE.

03:05:06.762 --> 03:05:11.701 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM ALREADY LOSING

03:05:08.931 --> 03:05:13.269 region:rollup2
MONEY AND THE WHEN WHEN THAT

03:05:11.701 --> 03:05:13.869 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHEN THOSE REIMBURSEMENT

03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:15.271 region:rollup2
RATES WHEN THAT BALANCE IS NOT

03:05:13.869 --> 03:05:18.274 region:rollup2
--

03:05:15.271 --> 03:05:20.076 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH MORE OF THEM WILL LOSE

03:05:18.274 --> 03:05:21.243 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THEM WILL CLOSE THE

03:05:20.076 --> 03:05:23.245 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON

03:05:21.243 --> 03:05:25.848 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS HAVE TO GO THREE TIMES

03:05:23.245 --> 03:05:27.016 region:rollup2
A WEEK THREE OF FOUR HOURS --

03:05:25.848 --> 03:05:28.718 region:rollup2
MY FRIEND HERE WHO HAS THE

03:05:27.016 --> 03:05:30.519 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS PATIENT UNDERSTANDS

03:05:28.718 --> 03:05:32.488 region:rollup2
THAT VERY WELL SHE NOW GOES TO

03:05:30.519 --> 03:05:33.522 region:rollup2
DIALYSIS CENTER THAT'S CLOSE TO

03:05:32.488 --> 03:05:35.391 region:rollup2
HER HOME.

03:05:33.522 --> 03:05:37.827 region:rollup2
IF CENTERS CLOSE THOSE DIALYSIS

03:05:35.391 --> 03:05:39.662 region:rollup2
CENTERS MAY INVOLVE A MUCH

03:05:37.827 --> 03:05:42.365 region:rollup2
LONGER DISTANCE OF TRAVEL WE'RE

03:05:39.662 --> 03:05:44.367 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE 75280% OF

03:05:42.365 --> 03:05:45.635 region:rollup2
WHOM ARE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE OF

03:05:44.367 --> 03:05:46.602 region:rollup2
THE TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THE

03:05:45.635 --> 03:05:48.304 region:rollup2
DISEASE.

03:05:46.602 --> 03:05:50.072 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

03:05:48.304 --> 03:05:51.907 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T OFTEN DON'T HAVE

03:05:50.072 --> 03:05:53.676 region:rollup2
PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION CANNOT

03:05:51.907 --> 03:05:55.378 region:rollup2
AFFORD PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DO

03:05:53.676 --> 03:05:56.912 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE SOMEBODY TO TAKE THEM

03:05:55.378 --> 03:05:57.813 region:rollup2
HOW WILL THEY GET TO THE CARE

03:05:56.912 --> 03:05:59.548 region:rollup2
THAT THEY NEED THAT IS THE

03:05:57.813 --> 03:06:00.583 region:rollup2
ACCESS ISSUE SO LET ME ASK YOU

03:05:59.548 --> 03:06:03.519 region:rollup2
THIS I AGREE.

03:06:00.583 --> 03:06:04.186 region:rollup2
I THINK WE AGREE.

03:06:03.519 --> 03:06:04.787 region:rollup2
AND TELL ME IF I'M WRONG I WANT

03:06:04.186 --> 03:06:05.888 region:rollup2
IT IS OPTIONS THAT MEDICARE

03:06:04.787 --> 03:06:06.956 region:rollup2
RATES ARE LOW.

03:06:05.888 --> 03:06:08.290 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT

03:06:06.956 --> 03:06:10.593 region:rollup2
TO SERVE PEOPLE IN EVERY

03:06:08.290 --> 03:06:11.861 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY

03:06:10.593 --> 03:06:13.763 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THOSE RATES BEING LOW

03:06:11.861 --> 03:06:15.731 region:rollup2
IT MAKES A HARPER PROVIDERS. TO

03:06:13.763 --> 03:06:16.799 region:rollup2
SERVE EVERYONE I I THINK WE

03:06:15.731 --> 03:06:18.167 region:rollup2
AGREE ON THAT I THINK THAT'S A

03:06:16.799 --> 03:06:19.301 region:rollup2
MATTER THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON

03:06:18.167 --> 03:06:21.871 region:rollup2
HOW TO INCREASE MEDICARE

03:06:19.301 --> 03:06:23.472 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATES --

03:06:21.871 --> 03:06:25.141 region:rollup2
AND IT'S MEDICARE I STEERED YOU

03:06:23.472 --> 03:06:26.008 region:rollup2
WRONG BY SAYING MEDI CAL I

03:06:25.141 --> 03:06:27.376 region:rollup2
APOLOGIZE.

03:06:26.008 --> 03:06:28.411 region:rollup2
THAT OKAY --

03:06:27.376 --> 03:06:30.312 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I HEARD IS THAT A

03:06:28.411 --> 03:06:31.614 region:rollup2
PERSON DOESN'T LOSE THE ABILITY

03:06:30.312 --> 03:06:32.848 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THE THIRD PARTY PAYMENTS

03:06:31.614 --> 03:06:35.851 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS BILL.

03:06:32.848 --> 03:06:36.786 region:rollup2

MEDICARE WILL NOT LOSE THE THIRD

03:06:44.627 --> 03:06:48.064 region:rollup2
PARTY REIMBURSEMENT BUT THE

03:06:46.195 --> 03:06:49.765 region:rollup2
THIRD PARTY REIMBURSEMENT IS OF

03:06:48.064 --> 03:06:50.966 region:rollup2
NO USE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A

WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THE GRANTS

03:08:24.093 --> 03:08:27.930 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S IT MUST BE

03:08:27.163 --> 03:08:29.131 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN

03:08:27.930 --> 03:08:30.466 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

03:08:29.131 --> 03:08:32.468 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT THE BILL AS WRITTEN

03:08:30.466 --> 03:08:33.269 region:rollup2

I I I I FAMILIAR WITH COBRA.

03:08:41.310 --> 03:08:45.447 region:rollup2

03:08:43.612 --> 03:08:46.882 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT YOU MEMBERS DO AND

03:08:45.447 --> 03:08:49.385 region:rollup2
THAT IT CAN BE SEASONAL.

03:08:46.882 --> 03:08:50.119 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD BE A CONCERN TO ME

03:08:49.385 --> 03:08:51.687 region:rollup2
IF SOMEONE WAS ESSENTIALLY

03:08:50.119 --> 03:08:53.789 region:rollup2
FORCED TO GIVE UP THEIR

03:08:51.687 --> 03:08:55.491 region:rollup2
INSURANCE FOR THEIR FAMILY

03:08:53.789 --> 03:08:57.459 region:rollup2
MEMBERS FOR THEIR DEPENDENTS.

03:08:55.491 --> 03:09:00.262 region:rollup2
I WANT TO ASK THE AUTHOR HOW THE

03:08:57.459 --> 03:09:01.430 region:rollup2
BILL SPEAKS TO THAT BECAUSE I

03:09:00.262 --> 03:09:02.231 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL WAS STE

03:09:01.430 --> 03:09:03.065 region:rollup2
WHO AT LEAST ATTEMPTING TO

03:09:02.231 --> 03:09:06.001 region:rollup2
CREATE.

03:09:03.065 --> 03:09:08.304 region:rollup2
SOME WORKAROUNDS --

03:09:06.001 --> 03:09:08.904 region:rollup2
FOR FOLKS WHO FALL IN A UNIQUE

03:09:08.304 --> 03:09:10.339 region:rollup2
SITUATION LIKE THOSE THAT YOU

03:09:08.904 --> 03:09:12.007 region:rollup2

03:09:10.339 --> 03:09:13.309 region:rollup2
BUT BEFORE BEFORE YES APPRECIATE

03:09:12.007 --> 03:09:14.543 region:rollup2

OFFER SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THAT

03:09:14.543 --> 03:09:16.579 region:rollup2
TERRIFIES AND MAYBE DOES AND I'M

03:09:15.778 --> 03:09:19.582 region:rollup2
NOT TRYING TO MUDDY THE WATER

03:09:16.579 --> 03:09:20.149 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALREADY REALLY.

03:09:19.582 --> 03:09:21.851 region:rollup2
WHY NOT LET'S PUT SOME MORE

03:09:20.149 --> 03:09:23.586 region:rollup2
MONEY?

03:09:21.851 --> 03:09:24.086 region:rollup2
LOOK MY AMENDMENTS WERE INTENDED

03:09:23.586 --> 03:09:26.021 region:rollup2
TO AVOID DISRUPTION FOR

03:09:24.086 --> 03:09:27.323 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

03:09:26.021 --> 03:09:29.425 region:rollup2
BUT ELIMINATE THE FINANCIAL

03:09:27.323 --> 03:09:31.360 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES.

03:09:29.425 --> 03:09:32.695 region:rollup2
THAT WAS MY INTENTION NOTHING IN

03:09:31.360 --> 03:09:34.697 region:rollup2
THE BILL WILL TO PROHIBIT THE

03:09:32.695 --> 03:09:35.898 region:rollup2

HELP PATIENTS.

03:09:37.733 --> 03:09:39.869 region:rollup2
BUT THIS WILL TEST WHETHER

03:09:38.767 --> 03:09:41.837 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE MAKING THE

BY A TRUSTS HEALTH INSURER NO

03:11:30.813 --> 03:11:34.683 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

03:11:32.314 --> 03:11:36.819 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER PATIENT AND AS THE

03:11:34.683 --> 03:11:38.020 region:rollup2
CHAIR SAID --

03:11:36.819 --> 03:11:39.621 region:rollup2
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL

03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:42.725 region:rollup2
THAT PROHIBITS A THIRD PARTY

03:11:39.621 --> 03:11:43.726 region:rollup2
FROM MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS TO

03:11:42.725 --> 03:11:44.526 region:rollup2
PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE

03:11:43.726 --> 03:11:48.697 region:rollup2
COVERAGE TO PAY THAT COBRA

03:11:44.526 --> 03:11:50.232 region:rollup2
PREMIUM. FOR EXACTLY THE THE

03:11:48.697 --> 03:11:51.567 region:rollup2
WORKER THAT WAS DESCRIBED

03:11:50.232 --> 03:11:52.868 region:rollup2
NOTHING IN THE BILL PROHIBITS

03:11:51.567 --> 03:11:54.737 region:rollup2
THAT COBRA PAYMENT.

03:11:52.868 --> 03:11:56.205 region:rollup2
ALL THAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT IF

03:11:54.737 --> 03:11:57.706 region:rollup2
IT IS A FINANCIALLY INTERESTED

03:11:56.205 --> 03:11:58.974 region:rollup2
PAVEMENT BY FINANCIALLY

03:11:57.706 --> 03:12:00.876 region:rollup2
INTERESTED CITY.

03:11:58.974 --> 03:12:01.777 region:rollup2
THEN IT WOULD TRIGGER THAT MEDIC

03:12:00.876 --> 03:12:04.213 region:rollup2
ABOUT LOWER OF THE MEDICARE

03:12:01.777 --> 03:12:07.216 region:rollup2
RATES OR THE CONTRACTED RATE.

03:12:04.213 --> 03:12:10.019 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS.

03:12:07.216 --> 03:12:11.487 region:rollup2
NO REASON WHY A PERSON WOULD BE

03:12:10.019 --> 03:12:13.188 region:rollup2
FORCED OFF OF COBRA.

03:12:11.487 --> 03:12:15.657 region:rollup2

03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:17.393 region:rollup2
IN LESS.

03:12:15.657 --> 03:12:19.795 region:rollup2
THE THIRD PARTY ENTITY IS

03:12:17.393 --> 03:12:22.264 region:rollup2
CHOOSING TO TO NO LONGER MAKE

03:12:19.795 --> 03:12:24.299 region:rollup2
THOSE PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE

03:12:22.264 --> 03:12:25.768 region:rollup2
PROVIDER WOULD RECEIVE A LOWER

03:12:24.299 --> 03:12:27.336 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATE SO THE

03:12:25.768 --> 03:12:27.903 region:rollup2
MESSAGE I THINK I FOLLOWED THAT

03:12:27.336 --> 03:12:29.805 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHAT I HEARD YOU

03:12:27.903 --> 03:12:32.141 region:rollup2

03:12:29.805 --> 03:12:33.742 region:rollup2
IS THAT -- A

03:12:32.141 --> 03:12:35.577 region:rollup2
THIRD PARTY ENTITY COULD MAKE A

03:12:33.742 --> 03:12:37.379 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION TO HELP SOMEONE WHO

03:12:35.577 --> 03:12:38.981 region:rollup2

03:12:43.786 --> 03:12:49.858 region:rollup2
THE ASSURANCE THAT THEY HAVE THE

IT -- MAY BE

03:13:19.521 --> 03:13:23.192 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS IS THERE NYTHING

03:13:21.156 --> 03:13:24.560 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS BILL THAT SAYS IF

03:13:23.192 --> 03:13:27.062 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE MINUTES A MEMBER.

03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:29.731 region:rollup2
OF ONE OF THESE GROUPS AND IS

03:13:27.062 --> 03:13:33.335 region:rollup2
ALL CORPORA --

03:13:29.731 --> 03:13:34.903 region:rollup2
THAT HE HAS TO GIVE ME.

03:13:33.335 --> 03:13:37.172 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEONE WHO IS --

03:13:34.903 --> 03:13:39.141 region:rollup2
A SEASONAL WORKER AND CORPORATE

03:13:37.172 --> 03:13:41.009 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT QUALIFY.

03:13:39.141 --> 03:13:42.144 region:rollup2
FROM MEDICARE --

03:13:41.009 --> 03:13:43.946 region:rollup2
IN THEIR CURRENT FINANCIAL

03:13:42.144 --> 03:13:45.214 region:rollup2
SITUATION AND THAT OF THE THIRD

03:13:43.946 --> 03:13:48.250 region:rollup2
PARTY GROUP WAS GOING TO

03:13:45.214 --> 03:13:49.451 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR CARE

03:13:48.250 --> 03:13:50.786 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REASON

03:13:49.451 --> 03:13:51.353 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS BILL FOR THAT TO

03:13:50.786 --> 03:13:53.388 region:rollup2
CHANGE BUT I DON'T MAKE ANY

03:13:51.353 --> 03:13:55.691 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS.

03:13:53.388 --> 03:13:56.859 region:rollup2
THAT IS CORRECT THE I THINK THE

03:13:55.691 --> 03:13:58.827 region:rollup2
ONLY REASON THAT SOMEONE WOULD

03:13:56.859 --> 03:13:59.962 region:rollup2
NOT NO LONGER BE A COBRA IS IF

03:13:58.827 --> 03:14:00.929 region:rollup2
THEIR TIME RAN OUT MOST THE TIME

03:13:59.962 --> 03:14:02.130 region:rollup2

[inaudible]

03:14:02.431 --> 03:14:06.568 region:rollup2
GOT IT --

03:14:04.533 --> 03:14:08.137 region:rollup2
ANYHOW THIS ASK FROM THOSE OF

FROM AMERICA KIDNEY FUND OR

03:14:08.137 --> 03:14:10.539 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

03:14:08.971 --> 03:14:12.441 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU SEE

03:14:10.539 --> 03:14:14.109 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY THAT THIS BILL SAYS

03:14:12.441 --> 03:14:15.577 region:rollup2
THAT A PERSON'S OWN COBRA WHO

03:14:14.109 --> 03:14:17.379 region:rollup2
WANT TO STAY ON COBRA WHO REALLY

03:14:15.577 --> 03:14:18.780 region:rollup2
DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE.

03:14:17.379 --> 03:14:20.349 region:rollup2
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD --

03:14:18.780 --> 03:14:21.550 region:rollup2
WOULD IT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE

03:14:20.349 --> 03:14:24.119 region:rollup2
RECEIVING THEIR CARE THROUGH

03:14:21.550 --> 03:14:25.187 region:rollup2
THEIR CORPORATE ARRANGEMENT WITH

03:14:24.119 --> 03:14:25.754 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORT OF A THIRD PARTY.

03:14:25.187 --> 03:14:27.289 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE'VE

03:14:25.754 --> 03:14:29.024 region:rollup2
MISSED.

03:14:27.289 --> 03:14:30.592 region:rollup2
SO LONG AS WE HAD RESOURCES WE

03:14:29.024 --> 03:14:31.960 region:rollup2
COULD HELP THAT PERSON ARE

03:14:30.592 --> 03:14:33.529 region:rollup2
CONCERNED AS I MENTIONED BEFORE

03:14:31.960 --> 03:14:35.397 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

03:14:33.529 --> 03:14:37.499 region:rollup2
THE IN IN LOOKING AT THIS

03:14:35.397 --> 03:14:38.467 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AS REVISED ALTHOUGH

03:14:37.499 --> 03:14:40.269 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS

03:14:38.467 --> 03:14:42.204 region:rollup2
IN IT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THERE

03:14:40.269 --> 03:14:44.606 region:rollup2
ARE GRAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE

03:14:42.204 --> 03:14:46.008 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF DIALYSIS CARE

03:14:44.606 --> 03:14:47.476 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN LOOK THAT

03:14:46.008 --> 03:14:48.944 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED.

03:14:47.476 --> 03:14:51.013 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT IN THE

03:14:48.944 --> 03:14:52.748 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF PATIENTS IN THE CITY

03:14:51.013 --> 03:14:54.016 region:rollup2
AND IN THIS CUT IN THE STATE

03:14:52.748 --> 03:14:55.951 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

03:14:54.016 --> 03:14:57.419 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND ALL THE IMPLICATIONS

03:14:55.951 --> 03:14:58.720 region:rollup2
FOR ACCESS BEFORE THIS BILL IS

03:14:57.419 --> 03:14:59.955 region:rollup2
ACTED ON AYE I THINK YOU'RE

03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:00.522 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A

03:14:59.955 --> 03:15:01.790 region:rollup2
COMPETITION BUT THE LONG.

03:15:00.522 --> 03:15:03.959 region:rollup2
TERM --

03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:05.894 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF OUR STATE AND NATION

03:15:03.959 --> 03:15:07.462 region:rollup2
TO SERVE A DIALYSIS PATIENTS IN

03:15:05.894 --> 03:15:09.131 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WITH OTHER OTHER

03:15:07.462 --> 03:15:09.698 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS I AM IN TERMS OF

03:15:09.131 --> 03:15:10.399 region:rollup2
WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US

TODAY.

03:15:10.399 --> 03:15:14.136 region:rollup2
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THIS

03:15:12.501 --> 03:15:16.038 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH BEEN LIFTED UP

03:15:14.136 --> 03:15:17.472 region:rollup2
HIS AT THIS BILL DOES NOT FOR

03:20:21.142 --> 03:20:24.813 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO

03:20:23.378 --> 03:20:26.615 region:rollup2
180% OF THOSE TELL ME IF I'M

03:20:24.813 --> 03:20:27.983 region:rollup2
WRONG BUT 80% OF OUR PATIENTS

03:20:26.615 --> 03:20:29.918 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY ON MEDICARE IS

03:20:27.983 --> 03:20:30.852 region:rollup2
ALREADY PAINT.

03:20:29.918 --> 03:20:33.421 region:rollup2
TO SO IT'S ONLY THE EXTRA 20% OF

03:20:30.852 --> 03:20:34.656 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND THAT ARE THAT ARE

03:20:33.421 --> 03:20:36.124 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THAT THE THAT THE

03:20:34.656 --> 03:20:37.792 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PROVIDERS ARE ARE PAYING

03:20:36.124 --> 03:20:38.994 region:rollup2
THAT INCREASED THAT INCREASED

03:20:37.792 --> 03:20:41.196 region:rollup2
AMOUNT WHAT'S WRONG WITH.

03:20:38.994 --> 03:20:42.597 region:rollup2
SAYING LOOK YOU CAN STILL GIVE

03:20:41.196 --> 03:20:44.499 region:rollup2
TO AMERICA KIDNEY FUND YOU CAN

03:20:42.597 --> 03:20:45.667 region:rollup2
GIVE TO A NONPROFIT.

03:20:44.499 --> 03:20:46.668 region:rollup2
BUT IF THERE'S STUFF BUT

03:20:45.667 --> 03:20:48.470 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THE FINANCIAL

03:20:46.668 --> 03:20:50.005 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE YOU JUST ARE GOING TO

03:20:48.470 --> 03:20:51.206 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PAY THE MEDICARE RATE.

03:20:50.005 --> 03:20:53.408 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT TAKES MOST OF ALL

03:20:51.206 --> 03:20:54.809 region:rollup2
THE ARGUMENTS.

03:20:53.408 --> 03:20:56.912 region:rollup2
OFF THE TABLE AND SO I THINK

03:20:54.809 --> 03:20:57.946 region:rollup2
WHEN I SAW THOSE AMENDS BETWEEN

03:20:56.912 --> 03:20:59.848 region:rollup2
THECHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE IN

03:20:57.946 --> 03:21:01.383 region:rollup2
THE THE AUTHOR I'M NOT QUITE

03:20:59.848 --> 03:21:02.651 region:rollup2
SURE MORE OF WHAT WE CAN DEAL.

03:21:01.383 --> 03:21:05.553 region:rollup2
NOW I CAN CHOOSE --

03:21:02.651 --> 03:21:07.622 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'VE HAD THOSE PATIENTS

03:21:05.553 --> 03:21:08.523 region:rollup2
IN MY ARE IN MY OFFICE AND I'VE

03:21:07.622 --> 03:21:10.458 region:rollup2
HAD THOSE PHONE CALLS INTO MY

03:21:08.523 --> 03:21:12.294 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OFFICE IN. TO THE

03:21:10.458 --> 03:21:14.462 region:rollup2
CAPITOL OFFICE I CAN CHOOSE TO

03:21:12.294 --> 03:21:16.364 region:rollup2
TO TURN A BLIND EYE. TO THAT BUT

03:21:14.462 --> 03:21:17.365 region:rollup2
THE FACT IS FOLKS ARE GAME IN

03:21:16.364 --> 03:21:17.933 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

03:21:17.365 --> 03:21:20.368 region:rollup2
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT

03:21:17.933 --> 03:21:20.902 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:22.170 region:rollup2
SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS

03:21:20.902 --> 03:21:25.574 region:rollup2
TODAY.

03:21:22.170 --> 03:21:26.775 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO WHENEVER.

03:21:25.574 --> 03:21:30.278 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

03:21:26.775 --> 03:21:31.413 region:rollup2
WAS WELCOME.

03:21:30.278 --> 03:21:32.647 region:rollup2
IT'S TOUGH IT'S HARD WHEN WE

03:21:31.413 --> 03:21:34.349 region:rollup2
HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE ON BOTH

03:21:32.647 --> 03:21:35.417 region:rollup2
SIDES IN THE SO MANY ISSUES.

03:21:34.349 --> 03:21:36.251 region:rollup2
AND NOT YOU KNOW I JUST WANT

03:21:35.417 --> 03:21:37.686 region:rollup2
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

03:21:36.251 --> 03:21:38.687 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE USE.

03:21:37.686 --> 03:21:40.322 region:rollup2
ISSUE BECAUSE I'M VERY CONCERNED

03:21:38.687 --> 03:21:42.657 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT [inaudible]

03:21:40.322 --> 03:21:43.725 region:rollup2
ALSO PALM.

03:21:42.657 --> 03:21:45.694 region:rollup2
SOME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

03:21:43.725 --> 03:21:47.629 region:rollup2
THE RATES COULD EVEN BE.

03:21:45.694 --> 03:21:49.397 region:rollup2
AFFECTED OR CHANGED.

03:21:47.629 --> 03:21:51.099 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOKED AT

03:21:49.397 --> 03:21:53.602 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER.

03:21:51.099 --> 03:21:55.303 region:rollup2
RAISING REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO

03:21:53.602 --> 03:21:56.972 region:rollup2
HER TO HELP FOR TREATMENT.

03:21:55.303 --> 03:21:58.673 region:rollup2
WE WERE TOLD BY THE DEPARTMENT

03:21:56.972 --> 03:22:00.008 region:rollup2
OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON THE

03:21:58.673 --> 03:22:00.609 region:rollup2
RECORD AND I HAVE THE TRANSCRIPT

03:22:00.008 --> 03:22:03.244 region:rollup2
OF COURSE I DON'T HAVE WITH ME

03:22:00.609 --> 03:22:05.413 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THAT.

03:22:03.244 --> 03:22:07.315 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DON'T SET RATES.

03:22:05.413 --> 03:22:09.150 region:rollup2
SENATE STONE THROUGH ODS AND THE

03:22:07.315 --> 03:22:10.018 region:rollup2
WAIVERS ON THAT THE COUNTIES OF

03:22:09.150 --> 03:22:13.355 region:rollup2
SENDING THE RATES FOR THOSE

03:22:10.018 --> 03:22:14.689 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS SO IF WE COULDN'T.

03:22:13.355 --> 03:22:15.824 region:rollup2
REYES THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

03:22:14.689 --> 03:22:17.125 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO LOWER

03:22:15.824 --> 03:22:18.259 region:rollup2
THEM.

03:22:17.125 --> 03:22:21.196 region:rollup2
WITHOUT GOING COUNTY BY COUNTY

03:22:18.259 --> 03:22:23.398 region:rollup2
BY COUNTY.

03:22:21.196 --> 03:22:23.598 region:rollup2
A SIMILAR BERMAN ASK AND RESPOND

03:22:23.398 --> 03:22:25.266 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:22:23.598 --> 03:22:27.369 region:rollup2
YES THANK YOU.

03:22:25.266 --> 03:22:29.237 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING THIS

03:22:27.369 --> 03:22:30.005 region:rollup2
OCCUR AN IS THAT --

03:22:29.237 --> 03:22:31.873 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE

03:22:30.005 --> 03:22:33.842 region:rollup2
MARKET.

03:22:31.873 --> 03:22:34.843 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS

03:22:33.842 --> 03:22:37.445 region:rollup2
ADDRESS JUST THE COMMERCIAL

03:22:34.843 --> 03:22:39.280 region:rollup2
MARKET AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN

03:22:37.445 --> 03:22:40.682 region:rollup2
THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE SPACE IS

03:22:39.280 --> 03:22:42.851 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S GENERALLY OUT OF

03:22:40.682 --> 03:22:44.619 region:rollup2
NETWORK SUCH A SUPERUSER

03:22:42.851 --> 03:22:44.886 region:rollup2
TREATMENT CENTERS THEIR ADAM

03:22:44.619 --> 03:22:45.887 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

03:22:44.886 --> 03:22:49.090 region:rollup2
SO YOU DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT

03:22:45.887 --> 03:22:50.091 region:rollup2
WITH THEM FOR A PARTICULAR RATE.

03:22:49.090 --> 03:22:51.426 region:rollup2
WHAT THEIR THEN I'M NOT

03:22:50.091 --> 03:22:52.961 region:rollup2
PAINTBRUSH IN ALL OF THEM THIS

03:22:51.426 --> 03:22:54.696 region:rollup2
IS JUST SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS

03:22:52.961 --> 03:22:57.799 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THEY'LL DO IS THEY'LL

03:22:54.696 --> 03:23:00.068 region:rollup2
GO AND GET PEOPLE TO COME IN BY

03:22:57.799 --> 03:23:01.436 region:rollup2
USING A BODY WHAT THEY CALL BY

03:23:00.068 --> 03:23:02.037 region:rollup2
THE BROKERS WE'VE HEARD?

03:23:01.436 --> 03:23:04.205 region:rollup2
THOSE BILLS IN THIS COMMITTEE

03:23:02.037 --> 03:23:05.440 region:rollup2
AND AND THEY'LL GO AND GET

03:23:04.205 --> 03:23:06.941 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO JOIN GIVING THEM

03:23:05.440 --> 03:23:08.176 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES LIKE WE'RE GOING TO

03:23:06.941 --> 03:23:09.477 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU A SCHOLARSHIP ALLIANCE

03:23:08.176 --> 03:23:10.445 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE

03:23:09.477 --> 03:23:11.646 region:rollup2
BEING SIGNED UP FOR HEALTH

03:23:10.445 --> 03:23:12.547 region:rollup2
INSURANCE THEY'RE ADDICTED

03:23:11.646 --> 03:23:14.783 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

03:23:12.547 --> 03:23:16.718 region:rollup2
AND VULNERABLE THEY BRING THEM

03:23:14.783 --> 03:23:17.652 region:rollup2
INTO THESE TREATMENT CENTERS.

03:23:16.718 --> 03:23:19.287 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY SIGN HIM UP FOR

03:23:17.652 --> 03:23:20.655 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY

03:23:19.287 --> 03:23:21.790 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEY CAN BUILD THE

03:23:20.655 --> 03:23:22.691 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE FOR FAR MORE

03:23:21.790 --> 03:23:24.926 region:rollup2
THAN THEY'RE GOING TO PAY IN

03:23:22.691 --> 03:23:26.661 region:rollup2
PREMIUM PAYMENTS.

03:23:24.926 --> 03:23:28.730 region:rollup2
THEN AFTER THE NINETY DAY

03:23:26.661 --> 03:23:29.531 region:rollup2
TREATMENT PLAN IS OVER AND THEY

03:23:28.730 --> 03:23:31.132 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:23:29.531 --> 03:23:32.767 region:rollup2
QUESTIONED ABOUT WHY THIS PERSON

03:23:31.132 --> 03:23:34.502 region:rollup2
STILL.

03:23:32.767 --> 03:23:36.004 region:rollup2
TERRIBLY ADDICTED THE DAILY AS

03:23:34.502 --> 03:23:36.971 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE SAID THEY LITERALLY

03:23:36.004 --> 03:23:38.973 region:rollup2
KICKING TO THE CURB.

03:23:36.971 --> 03:23:40.875 region:rollup2
WHERE THINGS THAT THIS BILL DOES

03:23:38.973 --> 03:23:42.277 region:rollup2
IS IT REQUIRES A THIRD PARTY --

03:23:40.875 --> 03:23:44.646 region:rollup2
PAYER WHOSE FINANCIALLY

03:23:42.277 --> 03:23:46.381 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN PAYING FOR A FULL

03:23:44.646 --> 03:23:48.083 region:rollup2
YEAR OF OF PREMIUMS INSTEAD OF

03:23:46.381 --> 03:23:49.718 region:rollup2
THIS KICKING HIM TO THE CURB

03:23:48.083 --> 03:23:51.920 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU CAN'T BILL HEALTH

03:23:49.718 --> 03:23:53.188 region:rollup2
INSURERS ANYMORE.

03:23:51.920 --> 03:23:54.656 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME CARRY BECAUSE

03:23:53.188 --> 03:23:57.592 region:rollup2
THEY'RE OUT OF NETWORK THEIR

03:23:54.656 --> 03:23:59.027 region:rollup2
BILL CHARGES ARE EX IS PART.

03:23:57.592 --> 03:24:01.329 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS UPON

03:23:59.027 --> 03:24:03.765 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

03:24:01.329 --> 03:24:05.333 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU CAN TRY AND NEGOTIATE

03:24:03.765 --> 03:24:07.068 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THEM BUT YOU'RE PAYING

03:24:05.333 --> 03:24:09.137 region:rollup2
FAR MORE IN ADDED NETWORK

03:24:07.068 --> 03:24:10.839 region:rollup2
COVERAGE IN YOUR PAIN IN NETWORK

03:24:09.137 --> 03:24:12.140 region:rollup2
WITH THE CONTRACTED PROVIDER.

03:24:10.839 --> 03:24:13.374 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE IT'S IN THE

03:24:12.140 --> 03:24:14.442 region:rollup2
PATIENT'S BEST INTEREST TO GO TO

03:24:13.374 --> 03:24:15.877 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL PROVIDERS WITHIN A

03:24:14.442 --> 03:24:18.046 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

03:24:15.877 --> 03:24:20.248 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS BILL DOES NOT SAY

03:24:18.046 --> 03:24:21.850 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO PAY THOSE

03:24:20.248 --> 03:24:23.818 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

03:24:21.850 --> 03:24:25.286 region:rollup2
TO DO SOME --

03:24:23.818 --> 03:24:26.721 region:rollup2
SOME THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:24:25.286 --> 03:24:27.355 region:rollup2
THAT PATIENTS PROTECTED DURING

03:24:26.721 --> 03:24:29.290 region:rollup2
HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT THEIR

03:24:27.355 --> 03:24:30.925 region:rollup2
OPTIONS ARE.

03:24:29.290 --> 03:24:32.894 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO PAY THOSE

03:24:30.925 --> 03:24:34.095 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS FOR THEM.

03:24:32.894 --> 03:24:35.497 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MEET THOSE

03:24:34.095 --> 03:24:37.265 region:rollup2
STANDARDS LIKE PAYING FOR A FULL

03:24:35.497 --> 03:24:39.400 region:rollup2
YEAR LEADING THE HEALTH LAN

03:24:37.265 --> 03:24:41.035 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THAT YOU ARE PAYING

03:24:39.400 --> 03:24:43.171 region:rollup2
THESE THIRD PARTY PAYMENTS.

03:24:41.035 --> 03:24:44.939 region:rollup2
AND THEN AS YOU SAID THEY TAKE

03:24:43.171 --> 03:24:46.074 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE AWAY.

03:24:44.939 --> 03:24:48.209 region:rollup2
BY MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE

03:24:46.074 --> 03:24:50.812 region:rollup2
GONNA PAY THE MEDICARE RATE.

03:24:48.209 --> 03:24:52.981 region:rollup2
NOT MEDI CAL MEDICARE.

03:24:50.812 --> 03:24:55.250 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ON THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE

03:24:52.981 --> 03:24:57.385 region:rollup2
SPACE THAT'S THAT THE ANSWER

03:24:55.250 --> 03:24:58.787 region:rollup2
THAT QUESTION WHERE WERE NOT

03:24:57.385 --> 03:25:00.355 region:rollup2
PROHIBITING IT IN FACT THE FIRST

03:24:58.787 --> 03:25:02.190 region:rollup2
SENTENCE OF THIS BILL SAYS YOU

03:25:00.355 --> 03:25:04.292 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ACCEPT THOSE PAYMENTS

03:25:02.190 --> 03:25:06.294 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS HEALTH INSURERS.

03:25:04.292 --> 03:25:08.163 region:rollup2
BUT THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO

03:25:06.294 --> 03:25:09.898 region:rollup2
DO THE WRONG THING IS TAKEN AWAY

03:25:08.163 --> 03:25:11.566 region:rollup2
IN THAT AND THEY REQUIRED TO DO

03:25:09.898 --> 03:25:14.135 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT THING BY THE PATIENT

03:25:11.566 --> 03:25:14.736 region:rollup2
IS IS SET OUT IN THE BILL.

03:25:14.135 --> 03:25:18.773 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BUILT THAT

03:25:14.736 --> 03:25:21.242 region:rollup2
WAY.

03:25:18.773 --> 03:25:23.211 region:rollup2
THAT HANS I GUESS BUT THE FUNNY

03:25:21.242 --> 03:25:28.817 region:rollup2
IS THAT I DO HAVE IS ABOUT THE

03:25:23.211 --> 03:25:30.285 region:rollup2
RACE SENDING PART OF IT --

03:25:28.817 --> 03:25:32.954 region:rollup2
HE IT I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE

03:25:30.285 --> 03:25:34.389 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PAR VERSUS THE YOU KNOW

03:25:32.954 --> 03:25:34.689 region:rollup2
A MORE GOVERNMENT RUN

03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:38.293 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

03:25:34.689 --> 03:25:39.727 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE COMPARING ONE TYPE OF

03:25:38.293 --> 03:25:40.795 region:rollup2
PLAN TO ANOTHER.

03:25:39.727 --> 03:25:42.530 region:rollup2
AND I JUST I'M JUST CONCERNED

03:25:40.795 --> 03:25:43.965 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:46.367 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE SOMEONE CAN RESPOND TO

03:25:43.965 --> 03:25:47.769 region:rollup2
THAT THAT.

03:25:46.367 --> 03:25:49.170 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING IT IF

03:25:47.769 --> 03:25:50.738 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH

03:25:49.170 --> 03:25:52.941 region:rollup2
IN A DUMPY PEOPLE ON THE CURB.

03:25:50.738 --> 03:25:54.042 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM YOU KNOW PEOPLE

03:25:52.941 --> 03:25:54.642 region:rollup2

REMAINDER ASSEMBLY MEMBER THOSE

03:26:09.991 --> 03:26:12.560 region:rollup2

03:26:33.448 --> 03:26:37.118 region:rollup2
OTHER WAYS TO LOOK AT IT AS WELL

03:26:35.583 --> 03:26:38.186 region:rollup2

WAYS TO CONTROL THESE ISSUES AND

THOSE WAYS HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH

03:27:02.243 --> 03:27:05.280 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBER GUARDRAILS THAT WE

THINGS TO TO CONTROL THOSE AND

03:27:24.432 --> 03:27:27.402 region:rollup2

03:28:30.431 --> 03:28:34.369 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE POTENTIAL REIMBURSING

03:28:32.367 --> 03:28:34.936 region:rollup2
AT A HIGHER RATE.

03:28:34.369 --> 03:28:36.337 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THIS PRACTICE

03:28:34.936 --> 03:28:37.872 region:rollup2

SOME PARAMETERS FOR THE

03:28:38.373 --> 03:28:41.776 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

03:28:40.108 --> 03:28:43.211 region:rollup2
AS IMPORTANT THAT IN DOING SO WE

03:28:41.776 --> 03:28:44.946 region:rollup2

PLACE A BURDEN ON PATIENTS PLANS

03:29:00.495 --> 03:29:03.865 region:rollup2
OR REGULATORS.

03:29:02.230 --> 03:29:04.766 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS ALLOW ASSISTANCE

03:29:03.865 --> 03:29:06.501 region:rollup2

MEDICARE.

03:29:15.510 --> 03:29:20.248 region:rollup2
NOTHING PROHIBITS THAT --

03:29:18.112 --> 03:29:23.050 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THAT IS THE HEART

03:29:20.248 --> 03:29:24.752 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE HEART OF THE BILL.

03:29:23.050 --> 03:29:27.655 region:rollup2

IN FACT THEY STATED ON JUNE

03:46:18.765 --> 03:46:21.802 region:rollup2
TWENTIETH SUPPORT A SUPPORT

GROWTH IN THE NEW OPERATING

03:46:25.405 --> 03:46:29.976 region:rollup2
HOSPICES WILL FURTHER DELAY.

03:46:26.640 --> 03:46:30.944 region:rollup2
WAIT TIMES SO HOW WE HOW DO WE

03:46:29.976 --> 03:46:32.813 region:rollup2

03:46:30.944 --> 03:46:34.214 region:rollup2

THAT.

03:46:37.517 --> 03:46:42.322 region:rollup2
SO I IT'S WHY CLARIFY SO THE

03:46:39.719 --> 03:46:45.258 region:rollup2
ISSUE IS IS THAT THE DEFINITIONS

03:46:42.322 --> 03:46:47.260 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE BACKLOG. ONE YES.

03:46:45.258 --> 03:46:49.095 region:rollup2
BY CREATING THE DEFINITION ARE

03:46:47.260 --> 03:46:51.164 region:rollup2
WHERE INCREASING.

03:46:49.095 --> 03:46:51.765 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF BACKLOGS FOR THE

03:46:51.164 --> 03:46:53.166 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO TO NOT

03:46:51.765 --> 03:46:54.301 region:rollup2
BE ABLE.

03:46:53.166 --> 03:46:56.837 region:rollup2
TO FACILITATE MEETING THE NEEDS

03:46:54.301 --> 03:46:59.039 region:rollup2
STILL.

03:46:56.837 --> 03:47:02.843 region:rollup2
SO IN RESPECT TO THE SERVICE.

03:46:59.039 --> 03:47:05.979 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE SURVEYS.

03:47:02.843 --> 03:47:07.347 region:rollup2
OKAY SO DAMNED IF I MAY --

03:47:05.979 --> 03:47:10.350 region:rollup2
THE I KNOW IS NORMALLY THE SHE

03:47:07.347 --> 03:47:11.885 region:rollup2
REAL SIMPLE BILL WE ALL YOU KNOW

03:47:10.350 --> 03:47:13.153 region:rollup2
GATHER AROUND A LOT BUT THIS HAD

03:47:11.885 --> 03:47:14.287 region:rollup2
A SUBSTANTIAL.

03:47:13.153 --> 03:47:14.955 region:rollup2
CHANGES AND SO ON THAT'S WHEN

03:47:14.287 --> 03:47:15.889 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

03:47:14.955 --> 03:47:17.524 region:rollup2
IT SO THE APPLICANTS WILL STILL

03:47:15.889 --> 03:47:18.525 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THE REGULAR PAPER

03:47:17.524 --> 03:47:19.860 region:rollup2
APPLICATION PROCESS WHERE

03:47:18.525 --> 03:47:21.528 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REVIEWED BY OUR

03:47:19.860 --> 03:47:23.296 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS UNIT.

03:47:21.528 --> 03:47:24.998 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE PROVIDER HAS THE

03:47:23.296 --> 03:47:27.300 region:rollup2
OPTION TO GO TO ONE OF THESE

03:47:24.998 --> 03:47:27.534 region:rollup2
ACCREDITING BODIES TO RECEIVE A

03:47:27.300 --> 03:47:29.603 region:rollup2
SURVEY.

03:47:27.534 --> 03:47:30.971 region:rollup2
THOSE ACCREDITING BODIES MAY

03:47:29.603 --> 03:47:32.539 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY.

03:47:30.971 --> 03:47:33.874 region:rollup2
TO AND CONDUCT THE SURVEY AHEAD

03:47:32.539 --> 03:47:35.275 region:rollup2
OF THE SCHEDULE WHERE THE

03:47:33.874 --> 03:47:36.676 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT NORMALLY WOULD WHERE

03:47:35.275 --> 03:47:38.612 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE WAITING IN LINE

03:47:36.676 --> 03:47:39.246 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY.

03:47:38.612 --> 03:47:41.481 region:rollup2
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GET A

03:47:39.246 --> 03:47:43.049 region:rollup2
SURVEY.

03:47:41.481 --> 03:47:44.751 region:rollup2
AND SO WE THINK THAT HAVING THIS

03:47:43.049 --> 03:47:46.219 region:rollup2
OPTION MAY IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY

03:47:44.751 --> 03:47:47.387 region:rollup2
TO BECOME LICENSE.

03:47:46.219 --> 03:47:49.823 region:rollup2
SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S GOING TO

03:47:47.387 --> 03:47:51.024 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AS THEIR HANDS ARE GOING.

03:47:49.823 --> 03:47:52.092 region:rollup2
TO GET FULL AND ARE NOT GONNA

03:47:51.024 --> 03:47:53.059 region:rollup2
BUILD WHAT DO THERE'D THIS

03:47:52.092 --> 03:47:57.297 region:rollup2
SURVEY [inaudible]

03:47:53.059 --> 03:47:58.298 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY.

03:47:57.297 --> 03:48:00.233 region:rollup2
I AM NOT SURE THIS IS YOUR

03:47:58.298 --> 03:48:01.968 region:rollup2
QUESTION CAME QUE REPEAT THE

03:48:00.233 --> 03:48:03.436 region:rollup2
QUESTION AGAIN SORRY PRICE IT.

03:48:01.968 --> 03:48:04.905 region:rollup2
SO FROM FROM FROM APPEARANCE

03:48:03.436 --> 03:48:06.239 region:rollup2
THINKS IT LOOKS LIKE THE

03:48:04.905 --> 03:48:07.541 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

03:48:06.239 --> 03:48:09.276 region:rollup2
WILL PROBABLY HAVE THEIR HANDS

03:48:07.541 --> 03:48:10.176 region:rollup2
FULL AND WON'T BE ABLE.

03:48:09.276 --> 03:48:12.512 region:rollup2
TO REALLY GO OUT AND DO ALL OF

03:48:10.176 --> 03:48:13.346 region:rollup2
THE SURVEYS BECAUSE THERE.

03:48:12.512 --> 03:48:15.715 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TO GO AROUND

03:48:13.346 --> 03:48:18.051 region:rollup2
FOR THEM. TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ON A

03:48:15.715 --> 03:48:19.352 region:rollup2
FUNDING NOT ENOUGH ACT.

03:48:18.051 --> 03:48:20.186 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS IS SO WHAT WE'RE

03:48:19.352 --> 03:48:20.954 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO IS ACTUALLY A

03:48:20.186 --> 03:48:22.455 region:rollup2
LITTLE --

03:48:20.954 --> 03:48:23.423 region:rollup2
DECREASE THE BACKLOG I

03:48:22.455 --> 03:48:25.592 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND YEAH [inaudible]

03:48:23.423 --> 03:48:26.893 region:rollup2
SO -- BUT IT

03:48:25.592 --> 03:48:29.029 region:rollup2
DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THAT'S THE

03:48:26.893 --> 03:48:30.197 region:rollup2
WAY IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

03:48:29.029 --> 03:48:32.065 region:rollup2
MAYBE HAVE FRAMED THE QUESTION

03:48:30.197 --> 03:48:34.768 region:rollup2
WRONG I AND I APOLOGIZE KNOCKED

03:48:32.065 --> 03:48:36.570 region:rollup2
HIM BUT I IT'S A REAL CONCERN

03:48:34.768 --> 03:48:37.470 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S BEING

03:48:36.570 --> 03:48:39.873 region:rollup2
RAISED SO.

03:48:37.470 --> 03:48:42.409 region:rollup2
OKAY WELL AS AS AS I INDICATED

03:48:39.873 --> 03:48:44.377 region:rollup2
BEFORE MY TESTIMONY --

03:48:42.409 --> 03:48:46.112 region:rollup2
IF THE YEAH THERE ISN'T OUT AS A

03:48:44.377 --> 03:48:48.148 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BILL IF THERE IS A

03:48:46.112 --> 03:48:49.649 region:rollup2
PORTION THAT IS --

03:48:48.148 --> 03:48:51.318 region:rollup2

REMOVE THAT FROM THE BILL --

03:48:51.318 --> 03:48:56.489 region:rollup2
SO -- SO WE

03:48:54.854 --> 03:48:59.426 region:rollup2
CAN'T TRY TO ADDRESS YOUR

03:48:56.489 --> 03:49:00.860 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ADAM AND THEN --

03:48:59.426 --> 03:49:02.162 region:rollup2
WILL THEN IF WE WILL LOOK TO

03:49:00.860 --> 03:49:03.630 region:rollup2
REMOVE THAT PROVISION FROM THE

03:49:02.162 --> 03:49:04.664 region:rollup2
BILL I I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY

03:49:03.630 --> 03:49:06.633 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

03:49:04.664 --> 03:49:08.134 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO LIVE REMOVES THE

03:49:06.633 --> 03:49:09.703 region:rollup2
BACKLOG BY GIVING THEM SO WHAT

THAT MEANT WHAT THE BILL DOES

03:49:09.703 --> 03:49:12.572 region:rollup2

HOSPICE PROVIDER LICENSE.

03:49:20.080 --> 03:49:23.216 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE FACT THAT BEING

ACCREDITING ORGANIZATION AND

03:49:36.062 --> 03:49:40.867 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD --

03:49:37.163 --> 03:49:42.035 region:rollup2
THEREFORE ALLOW THEM --

03:49:40.867 --> 03:49:43.169 region:rollup2
TO APPROVED THE MORE QUICKLY

03:49:42.035 --> 03:49:45.038 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING TO SEND THEIR OWN

ACCREDITED THAT ENTITY.

03:49:48.775 --> 03:49:51.811 region:rollup2
OKAY SO THAT VERY WELL MAY BE

03:49:50.443 --> 03:49:53.780 region:rollup2
THE CRUX OF THE ENTIRE.

04:31:07.752 --> 04:31:12.423 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMING LEVEL OF DISABILITY

04:31:09.820 --> 04:31:13.724 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO SATISFY THE LPS

ONCE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE

04:31:16.694 --> 04:31:19.463 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME.

04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:35.312 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT S. B. TEN FORTY

04:31:33.744 --> 04:31:37.681 region:rollup2

04:31:35.312 --> 04:31:40.217 region:rollup2

A WE DO DISAGREE WITH THE

04:31:54.865 --> 04:31:59.737 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION THAT S. B. TEN FORTY

04:31:57.434 --> 04:32:01.071 region:rollup2

04:31:59.737 --> 04:32:02.173 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF

04:41:11.521 --> 04:41:15.425 region:rollup2
BUT IT MAY BE A STRETCH TO FIND

04:41:13.223 --> 04:41:17.227 region:rollup2
BETTER LANGUAGE WHEN A JUDGE OR

04:41:15.425 --> 04:41:18.695 region:rollup2
A COURT IS CONSIDERING.

04:41:17.227 --> 04:41:20.630 region:rollup2

AND THAT'S THE MORE HUMANE THING

04:41:31.708 --> 04:41:35.378 region:rollup2
TO DO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE

04:41:32.909 --> 04:41:37.581 region:rollup2
CAN'T LOSE IN THIS PROCESS AND I

04:41:35.378 --> 04:41:38.749 region:rollup2

OF THE DAY.

04:41:45.055 --> 04:41:49.393 region:rollup2
IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE MORE HUMANE

04:41:47.657 --> 04:41:50.427 region:rollup2
THING TO DO THAN TO WATCH --

04:41:49.393 --> 04:41:51.728 region:rollup2

SO ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT

04:48:49.012 --> 04:48:52.515 region:rollup2

OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY

04:49:01.357 --> 04:49:05.395 region:rollup2
REQUIRED IS TO GO TO COURT AND

GET PETITIONS FROM THE COURT.

04:49:05.395 --> 04:49:09.666 region:rollup2

AND AGAIN THE LAURA'S LAW IS --

04:49:15.839 --> 04:49:20.009 region:rollup2
A LESS RESTRICTIVE FORM --

04:49:18.341 --> 04:49:22.745 region:rollup2
INSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IT

04:49:20.009 --> 04:49:24.581 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ALLOW US TO PROVIDE FOR

IT INPATIENT TREATMENT WHEN THAT

04:49:24.581 --> 04:49:29.018 region:rollup2

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF PLACEMENT.

04:49:35.058 --> 04:49:38.828 region:rollup2

A WITH RESPECT TO ON THIS ISSUE

05:07:08.777 --> 05:07:11.980 region:rollup2
IS THE IDEA THAT PUBLIC AGENCY

05:07:10.412 --> 05:07:13.849 region:rollup2
PREFER PREFERENCE IN OUR

05:07:11.980 --> 05:07:14.650 region:rollup2

05:07:13.849 --> 05:07:15.717 region:rollup2
RIGHT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

05:07:14.650 --> 05:07:17.252 region:rollup2
MANAGE --

05:07:15.717 --> 05:07:18.553 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEMS

05:07:17.252 --> 05:07:20.188 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE THOSE A CRITICAL

05:07:18.553 --> 05:07:21.623 region:rollup2
SERVICES GENDER EXISTING PLANTS

05:07:20.188 --> 05:07:22.925 region:rollup2
RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

05:07:21.623 --> 05:07:24.159 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK OF THIS.

05:07:22.925 --> 05:07:25.794 region:rollup2
I THINK IN THE LARGER

05:07:24.159 --> 05:07:27.763 region:rollup2
ARCHITECTURE DE AND WILL LOOK TO

05:07:25.794 --> 05:07:28.664 region:rollup2
YOU WORK ON IT IT'S ALL ABOUT

05:07:27.763 --> 05:07:30.932 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SET A FRAMEWORK FOR

LOCAL OPTIONS RIGHT IF YOU READ

05:07:30.932 --> 05:07:33.268 region:rollup2
THIS IF A LOCAL AGENCY WITH THE

05:07:31.867 --> 05:07:35.203 region:rollup2
COUNTY ELECTS TO DEVELOP.

05:07:33.268 --> 05:07:35.771 region:rollup2
HERE'S HOW TO DO THIS AND GOES

05:07:35.203 --> 05:07:37.306 region:rollup2
THROUGH AND SETS FORTH THAT

05:07:35.771 --> 05:07:38.740 region:rollup2
PLANTS SO I THINK THERE IS

05:07:37.306 --> 05:07:40.275 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY FLEXIBILITY CERTAIN

05:07:38.740 --> 05:07:41.243 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY.

05:07:40.275 --> 05:07:43.011 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE THE

05:07:41.243 --> 05:07:44.313 region:rollup2
FIRST RESPONDER IF YOU WILL IN

05:07:43.011 --> 05:07:44.947 region:rollup2
THOSE COUNTIES WHERE THEY DON'T

05:07:44.313 --> 05:07:48.417 region:rollup2
HAVE A I THINK GOVERNMENT WILL

05:07:44.947 --> 05:07:48.984 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO DO

05:07:48.417 --> 05:07:49.284 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A CAR APPROPRIATELY

05:07:48.984 --> 05:07:51.253 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

05:07:49.284 --> 05:07:53.522 region:rollup2
AND BEING SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE

05:07:51.253 --> 05:07:55.624 region:rollup2
FRONTLINE WHO DOES RESPOND ON A

05:07:53.522 --> 05:07:56.892 region:rollup2
REGULAR BASIS AS AN EMT --

05:07:55.624 --> 05:07:59.461 region:rollup2
I COULD SEE THE SAME PATIENT

05:07:56.892 --> 05:08:01.763 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER.

05:07:59.461 --> 05:08:04.733 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER RIGHT IT'S

05:08:01.763 --> 05:08:05.701 region:rollup2
GROUNDHOG DAY IN MANY CASES --

05:08:04.733 --> 05:08:07.736 region:rollup2
IN THAT THIS THE SCENARIO NEVER

05:08:05.701 --> 05:08:08.537 region:rollup2
CHANGES.

05:08:07.736 --> 05:08:10.539 region:rollup2
I CAN'T CITE ONE WHERE DID

05:08:08.537 --> 05:08:12.274 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

05:08:10.539 --> 05:08:13.408 region:rollup2
REALLY YEAH THE THIRD TIME THERE

I WALKED IN AND IT'S ILLEGALLY

05:08:16.745 --> 05:08:21.950 region:rollup2
SHOT FIVE TIMES.

05:08:18.547 --> 05:08:23.185 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A TIME TO TAKE YOUR

05:08:21.950 --> 05:08:25.087 region:rollup2
SIGN AND LEAVE.

05:08:23.185 --> 05:08:26.588 region:rollup2
IT SO ANY DID HE DID DESTRUCTIVE

05:08:25.087 --> 05:08:27.756 region:rollup2
WEAPON --

05:08:26.588 --> 05:08:30.392 region:rollup2
DON'T THE REALITY THE REAL ISSUE

05:08:27.756 --> 05:08:32.894 region:rollup2
IS.

05:08:30.392 --> 05:08:34.396 region:rollup2
FIREMAN GET THEIR FIRST.

05:08:32.894 --> 05:08:36.298 region:rollup2
IN THE RURAL AREA RIGHT BUT THE

05:08:34.396 --> 05:08:37.899 region:rollup2
TRUTH IS.

05:08:36.298 --> 05:08:39.634 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE PARAMEDICS IN A

05:08:37.899 --> 05:08:41.236 region:rollup2
FIRE SYSTEM IN RURAL AREAS FOR

05:08:39.634 --> 05:08:42.471 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY NOT IN ALL

05:08:41.236 --> 05:08:43.739 region:rollup2
AREAS BUT IF FOR THE VAST

05:08:42.471 --> 05:08:44.373 region:rollup2
MAJORITY AT LEAST THE DISTRICT

05:08:43.739 --> 05:08:46.074 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN SAY.

05:08:44.373 --> 05:08:48.677 region:rollup2
I REPRESENT.

05:08:46.074 --> 05:08:50.645 region:rollup2
IN MOST CASES IS THE LOCALEMS

05:08:48.677 --> 05:08:52.414 region:rollup2
AMBULANCE CARRIERS.

05:08:50.645 --> 05:08:53.415 region:rollup2
THERE THE FIRST PEOPLE THERE IN

05:08:52.414 --> 05:08:55.017 region:rollup2
MANY CASES THEY'RE NONPROFIT

05:08:53.415 --> 05:08:57.052 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS [inaudible]

05:08:55.017 --> 05:08:58.487 region:rollup2
SO HOPEFULLY WE WON'T BE STE

05:08:57.052 --> 05:09:01.456 region:rollup2
TRADING [inaudible]

05:08:58.487 --> 05:09:02.924 region:rollup2
AND HARMING THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE

05:09:01.456 --> 05:09:05.093 region:rollup2
IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WILL BE

05:09:02.924 --> 05:09:05.694 region:rollup2
DOING OF VALUE JOB.

05:09:05.093 --> 05:09:08.130 region:rollup2
IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WE MOVE

05:09:05.694 --> 05:09:10.799 region:rollup2
FORWARD ON BUT AT THE SAME TIME

05:09:08.130 --> 05:09:12.034 region:rollup2
WORKING IN RESPECTING --

05:09:10.799 --> 05:09:14.036 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

05:09:12.034 --> 05:09:15.103 region:rollup2
CAN AND CAN'T DO AND I THINK

05:09:14.036 --> 05:09:16.138 region:rollup2
THIS MEMO COVERS A GREAT DEAL OF

05:09:15.103 --> 05:09:18.073 region:rollup2
THAT?

05:09:16.138 --> 05:09:19.207 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF THEIR LIKE IT I

05:09:18.073 --> 05:09:19.708 region:rollup2
ENJOY TO SEE IF I COULD COULD IF

05:09:19.207 --> 05:09:20.609 region:rollup2
I COULD JUST ADD TO YOUR

05:09:19.708 --> 05:09:21.810 region:rollup2
THOUGHT.

05:09:20.609 --> 05:09:24.713 region:rollup2
WITH THE WHOLE THING SURE IT IN

05:09:21.810 --> 05:09:27.249 region:rollup2
SECTION SEVENTY NINE ONE SEVEN

05:09:24.713 --> 05:09:27.649 region:rollup2
NINE SEVEN POINT TO THE SEVEN

05:09:27.249 --> 05:09:29.184 region:rollup2
SEVEN TWO IT SAYS.

05:09:27.649 --> 05:09:30.852 region:rollup2
THAT THE REPORTER SUPERVISOR

05:09:29.184 --> 05:09:32.687 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE

05:09:30.852 --> 05:09:33.889 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND SO ALSO INCLUDE

05:09:32.687 --> 05:09:35.791 region:rollup2
THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS.

05:09:33.889 --> 05:09:36.958 region:rollup2
THAT ADVISE EMS AGENCY ON THE

05:09:35.791 --> 05:09:38.493 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF COMMITTEE

05:09:36.958 --> 05:09:39.961 region:rollup2
PARAMEDICS PROGRAMS SO THAT THE

05:09:38.493 --> 05:09:41.496 region:rollup2
WHOLE IDEA.

05:09:39.961 --> 05:09:42.764 region:rollup2
I THINK IN THE STATE IS BIGGEST

05:09:41.496 --> 05:09:44.933 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S LONGER STILL OF ONE

05:09:42.764 --> 05:09:45.200 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS SET OF THREE OR SIX

05:09:44.933 --> 05:09:47.135 region:rollup2
WHATEVER.

05:09:45.200 --> 05:09:47.869 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN

05:09:47.135 --> 05:09:49.638 region:rollup2
PROPOSED OVER THE YEARS.

05:09:47.869 --> 05:09:51.807 region:rollup2
THE IDEA IS TO MARRY THE

05:09:49.638 --> 05:09:53.341 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALISM BY REQUIRING TWO

05:09:51.807 --> 05:09:54.309 region:rollup2
REGISTERED NURSES RECORDING TO

05:09:53.341 --> 05:09:56.244 region:rollup2
E. R..

05:09:54.309 --> 05:09:58.747 region:rollup2
DOCKS REQUIRING A NUMBER OF

05:09:56.244 --> 05:10:00.582 region:rollup2
OTHER FOLKS IN THE PROCESS THAT

05:09:58.747 --> 05:10:01.583 region:rollup2
THAT THE STANDARDS BE SAD.

05:10:00.582 --> 05:10:02.217 region:rollup2
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO MAKE

05:10:01.583 --> 05:10:04.086 region:rollup2
THOSE DETERMINATIONS WITH THE

05:10:02.217 --> 05:10:05.220 region:rollup2
ADVICE.

05:10:04.086 --> 05:10:07.422 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOT EVERY CA I SUSPECT

05:10:05.220 --> 05:10:08.290 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ALPINE COUNTY AND THAT

05:10:07.422 --> 05:10:10.692 region:rollup2
WE CITIES --

05:10:08.290 --> 05:10:11.760 region:rollup2
OR TRINITY COUNTY WEAVERVILLE IT

05:10:10.692 --> 05:10:13.295 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS IN

05:10:11.760 --> 05:10:13.695 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO AND

05:10:13.295 --> 05:10:15.096 region:rollup2
THEY'LL MAKE THOSE

05:10:13.695 --> 05:10:16.431 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS WITH THE ADVICE

05:10:15.096 --> 05:10:18.633 region:rollup2
OF EXPERTS [inaudible]

05:10:16.431 --> 05:10:20.702 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IT.

05:10:18.633 --> 05:10:22.871 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE MPS GO.

05:10:20.702 --> 05:10:25.407 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE STANDARD NATIONWIDE.

05:10:22.871 --> 05:10:27.042 region:rollup2
AND WERE ON A NATIONALIST AND

05:10:25.407 --> 05:10:29.110 region:rollup2
AND WE DO HAVE STATED CALIFORNIA

05:10:27.042 --> 05:10:30.078 region:rollup2
STANDARD ARE THAT WE ACT ON AND

05:10:29.110 --> 05:10:33.281 region:rollup2
THEN EACH BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

05:10:30.078 --> 05:10:34.249 region:rollup2
ADOPTS THE IN MANY CASES THOSE

05:10:33.281 --> 05:10:35.817 region:rollup2
FORTY SUPERVISORS.

05:10:34.249 --> 05:10:37.619 region:rollup2
TURN IT OVER TO A JOINT.

05:10:35.817 --> 05:10:39.654 region:rollup2
OPERATION LIKE THE FRESNO MADERA

05:10:37.619 --> 05:10:40.989 region:rollup2
MARIN MERCED AGENCY WHICH IS

05:10:39.654 --> 05:10:42.424 region:rollup2
BASED ON A FRESNO.

05:10:40.989 --> 05:10:43.925 region:rollup2
WE WORK UNDER THOSE STANDARDS

05:10:42.424 --> 05:10:45.494 region:rollup2
AND THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE THAT'S

05:10:43.925 --> 05:10:47.496 region:rollup2
PLACED HIM IN IN.

05:10:45.494 --> 05:10:49.731 region:rollup2
IN ACTION AND THAT HAPPENS

05:10:47.496 --> 05:10:51.333 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THIS MY DISTRICT.

05:10:49.731 --> 05:10:54.069 region:rollup2
LIKE COUNTIES COMBINED AND WORK

05:10:51.333 --> 05:10:55.971 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN A MULTI AGENCY ARE A

05:10:54.069 --> 05:10:58.640 region:rollup2
WORLD SO IT BECOMES A LITTLE

05:10:55.971 --> 05:11:00.408 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLICATED IN THE CONTEXT

05:10:58.640 --> 05:11:02.377 region:rollup2
OF WHAT EVERYONE'S DOING.

05:11:00.408 --> 05:11:03.411 region:rollup2
ROSETTA POLLEN TWIRL A TO RURAL

05:11:02.377 --> 05:11:04.746 region:rollup2
FROM THAT URBANIZED THOUGHT

05:11:03.411 --> 05:11:05.313 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT MAYBE YOU'RE

05:11:04.746 --> 05:11:08.016 region:rollup2
ACCLIMATED TO FOUR I'M MORE

05:11:05.313 --> 05:11:09.584 region:rollup2
RULE.

05:11:08.016 --> 05:11:11.086 region:rollup2
ACCLIMATED.

05:11:09.584 --> 05:11:12.154 region:rollup2
TO GIVEN THAT SAID I THINK I'M

05:11:11.086 --> 05:11:12.587 region:rollup2
IN A PLACE WHERE I UNDERSTAND

05:11:12.154 --> 05:11:14.556 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

05:11:12.587 --> 05:11:16.625 region:rollup2
AND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

05:11:14.556 --> 05:11:18.360 region:rollup2
WE CAN SUPPORT OUR TODAY BUT I

05:11:16.625 --> 05:11:20.929 region:rollup2
DO HAVE ONE FINAL CONCERT.

05:11:18.360 --> 05:11:23.431 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE AGED --

05:11:20.929 --> 05:11:23.899 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND HOW WE CAN HANDLE

05:11:23.431 --> 05:11:24.966 region:rollup2
THAT.

05:11:23.899 --> 05:11:25.567 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS IT'S DIFFERENT

05:11:24.966 --> 05:11:27.869 region:rollup2
SCOPE IN A DIFFERENT MECHANISM

05:11:25.567 --> 05:11:30.472 region:rollup2
--

05:11:27.869 --> 05:11:33.308 region:rollup2
FOR HANDLING OF PATIENTS.

05:11:30.472 --> 05:11:33.575 region:rollup2
MAYBE THAT CONVERSATION CAN

05:11:33.308 --> 05:11:35.377 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

05:11:33.575 --> 05:11:36.611 region:rollup2
ULCER --

05:11:35.377 --> 05:11:37.913 region:rollup2
GREAT DEAL.

05:11:36.611 --> 05:11:39.714 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS WE GO THAT'S JUST A

05:11:37.913 --> 05:11:42.217 region:rollup2
SEPARATE ENTITY THAT MOVES THE

05:11:39.714 --> 05:11:45.954 region:rollup2
PATIENT NOT ALWAYS IS THAT.

05:11:42.217 --> 05:11:48.823 region:rollup2
CALLED AN ADVANCED LIFE CALL.

05:11:45.954 --> 05:11:49.124 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU

05:11:48.823 --> 05:11:51.626 region:rollup2

05:11:49.124 --> 05:11:55.430 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE [inaudible]

05:11:51.626 --> 05:11:56.798 region:rollup2

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR --

05:11:56.798 --> 05:12:01.102 region:rollup2

I WOULD START WITH --

05:12:01.102 --> 05:12:05.307 region:rollup2
THE EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS

05:12:02.671 --> 05:12:06.541 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVE VALUE YOU

05:12:05.307 --> 05:12:08.543 region:rollup2
OUTLINED THAT PREVIOUS SEE.

05:12:06.541 --> 05:12:10.378 region:rollup2
THERE WAS OPPOSITION AND I DO

05:12:08.543 --> 05:12:11.346 region:rollup2
REMEMBER HEARING ON A SIMILAR

05:12:10.378 --> 05:12:12.881 region:rollup2
BILL.

05:12:11.346 --> 05:12:15.250 region:rollup2
HEARING A CONCERN ABOUT WHO

05:12:12.881 --> 05:12:17.319 region:rollup2
SHOULD ASSESS SOMEONE'S --

05:12:15.250 --> 05:12:18.753 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CONDITION AND I GUESS I

05:12:17.319 --> 05:12:18.920 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION TO YOU

05:12:18.753 --> 05:12:22.357 region:rollup2
IN.

05:12:18.920 --> 05:12:24.960 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS ON BEHALF OF YOUR

05:12:22.357 --> 05:12:27.929 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW BOMB Y. THE CHANGE --

05:12:27.929 --> 05:12:29.731 region:rollup2
I GUESS IN YOUR POSITION WHAT'S

05:12:28.597 --> 05:12:31.199 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT --

05:12:29.731 --> 05:12:33.768 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE CONCERN EXPRESSED

05:12:31.199 --> 05:12:35.070 region:rollup2
BEFORE ARM INTO AND WHY SHOULD

05:12:33.768 --> 05:12:38.840 region:rollup2
THIS.

05:12:35.070 --> 05:12:40.809 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED IF --

05:12:38.840 --> 05:12:43.144 region:rollup2
THE ASSESSMENTS ARE HAPPENING --

05:12:40.809 --> 05:12:46.481 region:rollup2
BY A PHYSICIAN AND A NURSE IN IN

05:12:43.144 --> 05:12:47.882 region:rollup2
AN EMERGENCY ROOM SET.

05:12:46.481 --> 05:12:49.284 region:rollup2
I THINK YOUR SERMON.

05:12:47.882 --> 05:12:51.653 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS

05:12:49.284 --> 05:12:52.320 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT AND ASKING NINE

05:12:51.653 --> 05:12:53.788 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR THERE SOME GUARDRAILS

05:12:52.320 --> 05:12:55.457 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO

05:12:53.788 --> 05:12:57.158 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WHEN THE DEVELOPMENT

05:12:55.457 --> 05:12:58.026 region:rollup2
OF THE PROTOCOLS THAT WILL BE

05:12:57.158 --> 05:12:58.827 region:rollup2
USED BY THE PARAMEDICS IN THE

05:12:58.026 --> 05:12:59.761 region:rollup2
FIELD.

05:12:58.827 --> 05:13:02.764 region:rollup2
THEY'LL HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL

05:12:59.761 --> 05:13:06.201 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHTS YOU BOTH AT THE LOCAL

05:13:02.764 --> 05:13:07.569 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL AND

05:13:06.201 --> 05:13:09.304 region:rollup2
GETTING TO A KIND OF SENATE

05:13:07.569 --> 05:13:11.239 region:rollup2
AROUND THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS

05:13:09.304 --> 05:13:14.509 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED IN AND AND BE IN THE

05:13:11.239 --> 05:13:16.378 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS. ONE OF THE VALUES THAT

05:13:14.509 --> 05:13:17.479 region:rollup2
WE SEE IN THAT COMMITTEE IS THAT

05:13:16.378 --> 05:13:19.614 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE COMPRISED OF PEOPLE

05:13:17.479 --> 05:13:22.050 region:rollup2
WHO ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH

05:13:19.614 --> 05:13:23.618 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING PRODUCT BECAUSE FOR

05:13:22.050 --> 05:13:25.220 region:rollup2
IT ADDRESSING PATIENTS OF THAT.

05:13:23.618 --> 05:13:27.589 region:rollup2
KIND SO SOMEONE WHO IS A LOWER

05:13:25.220 --> 05:13:29.891 region:rollup2
CUTIE PATIENT TODAY M. SAYS MORE

05:13:27.589 --> 05:13:31.626 region:rollup2
GEARED TOWARDS TRUMPCARE.

05:13:29.891 --> 05:13:33.528 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE GEARED TOWARDS SETTING

05:13:31.626 --> 05:13:35.263 region:rollup2
UP SYSTEMS FOR ESTABLISHING

05:13:33.528 --> 05:13:36.831 region:rollup2
CRITERIA FOR A STROKES AND OR

05:13:35.263 --> 05:13:38.667 region:rollup2
STOP ME CENTERS ALSO A VERY

05:13:36.831 --> 05:13:40.368 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPE OF THE PATIENT.

05:13:38.667 --> 05:13:41.503 region:rollup2
ARE CONCERNED WITH THE CURRENT

05:13:40.368 --> 05:13:43.271 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF THEM SAYS THAT IT

05:13:41.503 --> 05:13:47.075 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE COMPRISED OF ENOUGH

05:13:43.271 --> 05:13:48.109 region:rollup2
EXPERTS. TO BEST EVALUATE

05:13:47.075 --> 05:13:50.478 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE PROTOCOLS BEING

05:13:48.109 --> 05:13:52.747 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A

05:13:50.478 --> 05:13:53.315 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPE OF THE PATIENT.

05:13:52.747 --> 05:13:55.583 region:rollup2
SO US WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG

05:13:53.315 --> 05:13:56.484 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT TRYING --

05:13:55.583 --> 05:13:58.420 region:rollup2
TO TO THROUGHOUT WHAT THE

05:13:56.484 --> 05:13:59.587 region:rollup2
COMPOSITION OF THAT IS SO WE

05:13:58.420 --> 05:14:01.756 region:rollup2
FELT THAT WAS ANOTHER IMPORTANT

05:13:59.587 --> 05:14:03.024 region:rollup2
PART OF S. B. NINE FORTY FOUR

05:14:01.756 --> 05:14:03.958 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD NOT SEEN ANOTHER

05:14:03.024 --> 05:14:05.694 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

05:14:03.958 --> 05:14:07.762 region:rollup2
FOUND WE ALSO FELT IT WAS

05:14:05.694 --> 05:14:09.964 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO HAVE WHATEVER WE

05:14:07.762 --> 05:14:11.299 region:rollup2
PUT INTO LAW IS LARGELY BASED ON

05:14:09.964 --> 05:14:12.834 region:rollup2
THE PILOTS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED

05:14:11.299 --> 05:14:13.868 region:rollup2
SO OUR PERSPECTIVE IS DIFFERENT

05:14:12.834 --> 05:14:16.137 region:rollup2
TEST SOMETHING.

05:14:13.868 --> 05:14:17.806 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT IT HAS SHOWN THAT

05:14:16.137 --> 05:14:19.307 region:rollup2
THAT THIS CAN BE DONE THAT WE

05:14:17.806 --> 05:14:20.275 region:rollup2
SHOULD MODEL LEGISLATION AROUND

05:14:19.307 --> 05:14:21.943 region:rollup2
THAT.

05:14:20.275 --> 05:14:24.179 region:rollup2
IN THE ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT

05:14:21.943 --> 05:14:25.246 region:rollup2
ONES IS THAT WE INCLUDE LANGUAGE

05:14:24.179 --> 05:14:26.514 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT ALL PATIENTS ARE

05:14:25.246 --> 05:14:28.583 region:rollup2
TREATED EQUALLY.

05:14:26.514 --> 05:14:30.418 region:rollup2
SO WE WORRY THAT IF YOU SET UP A

05:14:28.583 --> 05:14:31.686 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE POTENTIALLY ONLY

05:14:30.418 --> 05:14:32.921 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PATIENTS GO TO A

05:14:31.686 --> 05:14:34.789 region:rollup2
SOBERING CENTER SO MAYBE YOU'RE

05:14:32.921 --> 05:14:37.525 region:rollup2
HOMELESS PATIENTS --

05:14:34.789 --> 05:14:38.393 region:rollup2
ARE MORE LIKELY TO END UP IN

05:14:37.525 --> 05:14:40.195 region:rollup2
THAT SITUATION WHERE IT'S A

05:14:38.393 --> 05:14:42.230 region:rollup2
BETTER PAYING PAY SHOULD BE MORE

05:14:40.195 --> 05:14:44.065 region:rollup2
LIKELY THAN UP AT THE HOSPITAL.

05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:45.100 region:rollup2
AYE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

05:14:44.065 --> 05:14:46.568 region:rollup2
THE SPIRIT OF PROVIDING

05:14:45.100 --> 05:14:47.802 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES THAT

05:14:46.568 --> 05:14:49.237 region:rollup2
WE TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME

05:14:47.802 --> 05:14:50.872 region:rollup2
THAT'S EQUAL ACCESS SO THOSE

05:14:49.237 --> 05:14:52.807 region:rollup2
THINGS WERE INCLUDED WHICH GOT

05:14:50.872 --> 05:14:54.075 region:rollup2
OUR ORGANIZATION TO MORE.

05:14:52.807 --> 05:14:56.077 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE LEVEL CLASSES

05:14:54.075 --> 05:14:58.113 region:rollup2
QUESTION --

05:14:56.077 --> 05:15:00.048 region:rollup2
TO THAT PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS

05:14:58.113 --> 05:15:02.083 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IS THIS IS ABOUT SCOPE

05:15:00.048 --> 05:15:03.351 region:rollup2
OF PRACTICE MEANING WE HAVE TWO

GROUPS SAID --

05:15:03.351 --> 05:15:06.755 region:rollup2

WELL BY NURSES --

05:15:10.258 --> 05:15:14.729 region:rollup2
EXISTE CASE GORGEOUS SWAPPING

05:15:12.160 --> 05:15:16.431 region:rollup2
ONE GROUP FOR ANOTHER --

05:15:14.729 --> 05:15:19.701 region:rollup2
IS A CISCO POSITION CISCO

05:15:16.431 --> 05:15:20.668 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

TO BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS

05:15:26.674 --> 05:15:28.376 region:rollup2

I'M SORRY AND PASS IT OUT.

05:16:19.961 --> 05:16:24.599 region:rollup2
SO ABSOLUTELY WE DON'T FEEL THAT

05:16:23.231 --> 05:16:26.501 region:rollup2
THESE ARE GOOD MODELS IF I HAD

05:16:24.599 --> 05:16:28.136 region:rollup2
MORE TIME I WOULD LAY OUT ALL OF

05:16:26.501 --> 05:16:29.204 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW ADVERSE EVENTS

05:16:28.136 --> 05:16:30.939 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE HAPPENED.

05:16:29.204 --> 05:16:31.973 region:rollup2
WITH THE PILOTS THERE'S DATA

05:16:30.939 --> 05:16:32.740 region:rollup2
THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T COMPARE

05:16:31.973 --> 05:16:42.684 region:rollup2
THAT.

05:16:32.740 --> 05:16:43.351 region:rollup2
UCSF IS HIDING FROM US THAT INSA

05:16:42.684 --> 05:16:43.952 region:rollup2
IS HIDING FROM US WE ARE ASKING

05:16:43.351 --> 05:16:44.619 region:rollup2
FOR THE RAW DATA TO COMPARE

05:16:43.952 --> 05:16:45.153 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS THEY'RE NOT GIVING

05:16:44.619 --> 05:16:45.386 region:rollup2
IT TO US SO WHAT ARE THEY

05:16:45.153 --> 05:16:45.954 region:rollup2
HIDING.

05:16:45.386 --> 05:16:46.588 region:rollup2
SO NOT ONLY DO WE LEAVE THAT

05:16:45.954 --> 05:16:47.255 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SCHOOL FOR PROPOSITION

05:16:46.588 --> 05:16:47.922 region:rollup2
THAT PATIENTS HAVE BEEN DIVERTED

05:16:47.255 --> 05:16:49.891 region:rollup2
TO THE SOBERING CENTERS AND THEN

05:16:47.922 --> 05:16:50.859 region:rollup2
GO BACK TO THE E. R. BECAUSE THE

05:16:49.891 --> 05:16:52.026 region:rollup2
PARAMEDICS THAT ARE OUT IN THE

05:16:50.859 --> 05:16:53.228 region:rollup2
FIELD ARE ASSESSING THESE

05:16:52.026 --> 05:16:54.395 region:rollup2
PATIENTS --

05:16:53.228 --> 05:16:56.564 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY.

05:16:54.395 --> 05:16:58.867 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A A PATIENT WHO

05:16:56.564 --> 05:17:00.768 region:rollup2
IS IS YOU KNOW ON HOW THE

05:16:58.867 --> 05:17:03.905 region:rollup2
SOBERING ISSUE WHOSE INEBRIATED

05:17:00.768 --> 05:17:04.606 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T

05:17:03.905 --> 05:17:07.075 region:rollup2
ALWAYS PRESENT AS SUCH?

05:17:04.606 --> 05:17:08.576 region:rollup2
THESE PATIENTS MAY HAVE FALLEN

05:17:07.075 --> 05:17:10.278 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THOSE ISSUES AND

05:17:08.576 --> 05:17:11.212 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LAYERED ISSUES AND IN.

05:17:10.278 --> 05:17:13.581 region:rollup2
EMSA IN YOU SEE A STEPS ONLY

05:17:11.212 --> 05:17:16.050 region:rollup2
DATA.

05:17:13.581 --> 05:17:17.552 region:rollup2
TROUBLE IN THE FIELD.

05:17:16.050 --> 05:17:19.220 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IF IT'S DRUGS

05:17:17.552 --> 05:17:20.321 region:rollup2
OPIATES AND ALCOHOL THOSE ARE

05:17:19.220 --> 05:17:22.357 region:rollup2
LAYERED ISSUES AND THOSE ARE

05:17:20.321 --> 05:17:23.391 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLEX SITUATIONS SO THAT

05:17:22.357 --> 05:17:24.659 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO CAPTURED IN THE DATA

05:17:23.391 --> 05:17:26.261 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROPONENTS ARE TALKING

05:17:24.659 --> 05:17:27.128 region:rollup2
ABOUT TODAY.

05:17:26.261 --> 05:17:29.397 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANSWER ON

05:17:27.128 --> 05:17:30.665 region:rollup2
BEHALF OF HOSPICE IN THAT THE

05:17:29.397 --> 05:17:32.433 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR THE HOSPICE PROGRAMS

05:17:30.665 --> 05:17:33.067 region:rollup2
IS.

05:17:32.433 --> 05:17:34.903 region:rollup2
THE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR THE

05:17:33.067 --> 05:17:36.271 region:rollup2
PATIENT A PLAN OF CARE FOR

05:17:34.903 --> 05:17:38.406 region:rollup2
HOSPICE PATIENTS THE AVERAGE

05:17:36.271 --> 05:17:39.140 region:rollup2
STATE LIKE OF STATE FOR HOSPICE.

05:17:38.406 --> 05:17:40.942 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN DAYS SO THIS IS A

05:17:39.140 --> 05:17:42.410 region:rollup2
PATIENT POPULATION IN THE WANING

05:17:40.942 --> 05:17:45.113 region:rollup2
DAYS OF THEIR LIFE SO ENSURING

05:17:42.410 --> 05:17:46.481 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR CARE IS CONDUCTED AS

05:17:45.113 --> 05:17:48.750 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE ARRANGED WHEN DAVE'S

05:17:46.481 --> 05:17:50.518 region:rollup2
SECURED HOSPICE CARE --

05:17:48.750 --> 05:17:51.886 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT IF THERE ARE --

05:17:50.518 --> 05:17:53.154 region:rollup2
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES THAT THERE

05:17:51.886 --> 05:17:56.391 region:rollup2
HONORED BUT THERE'S ALSO THE

05:17:53.154 --> 05:17:58.026 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC ELEMENT OF IN INCLUDING

05:17:56.391 --> 05:17:59.661 region:rollup2
INTO HOW THAT PATIENT IS TREATED

05:17:58.026 --> 05:18:01.229 region:rollup2
AND NON LICENSED HOSPICE

05:17:59.661 --> 05:18:02.230 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL ISSUE.

05:18:01.229 --> 05:18:03.932 region:rollup2
THAT COULD PUT THE HOSPICE

05:18:02.230 --> 05:18:05.333 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AT RISK FINANCIALLY OR

05:18:03.932 --> 05:18:07.468 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT'S FAMILY AT RISK

05:18:05.333 --> 05:18:09.003 region:rollup2
COULD YOU JUST TELL US WHAT THE

05:18:07.468 --> 05:18:11.039 region:rollup2
BASELINE IS FOR EMERGENCY --

05:18:09.003 --> 05:18:11.606 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR SOMEONE IN A HOSPICE

05:18:11.039 --> 05:18:13.808 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT JUST LIKE AND

05:18:11.606 --> 05:18:15.143 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS NOW IN

05:18:13.808 --> 05:18:16.744 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE UNDER THE PARA

05:18:15.143 --> 05:18:18.146 region:rollup2
MEDICINE PROGRAM THE REASON I I

05:18:16.744 --> 05:18:18.680 region:rollup2
AND I SHOULD KNOW THIS BUT

05:18:18.146 --> 05:18:19.647 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WAS ALSO SOCIAL

05:18:18.680 --> 05:18:20.915 region:rollup2
WORKER.

05:18:19.647 --> 05:18:23.518 region:rollup2
AND I PROVIDED HOSPICE SOCIAL

05:18:20.915 --> 05:18:26.020 region:rollup2
WORK SERVICES IN.

05:18:23.518 --> 05:18:27.522 region:rollup2
IN HOMES. FOR PATIENTS BUT I

05:18:26.020 --> 05:18:30.525 region:rollup2
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ROLE

05:18:27.522 --> 05:18:31.526 region:rollup2
IS FOR THAT IMPAIR MEDICINE --

05:18:30.525 --> 05:18:33.594 region:rollup2
IN THE HOSPICE SO WHAT WE TALK

05:18:31.526 --> 05:18:35.263 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT'S THE CONCERN THAT

05:18:33.594 --> 05:18:37.432 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAPPEN.

05:18:35.263 --> 05:18:39.767 region:rollup2
WELL I GOT A CONCERN --

05:18:37.432 --> 05:18:41.903 region:rollup2
ONE CONCERN IS FOR EXAMPLE --

05:18:39.767 --> 05:18:43.504 region:rollup2
IF A PATIENT DOES NEED TO

05:18:41.903 --> 05:18:44.939 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATELY A HOSPICE PATIENT

05:18:43.504 --> 05:18:46.441 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE TRANSFERRED TO AN

05:18:44.939 --> 05:18:48.376 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM.

05:18:46.441 --> 05:18:49.911 region:rollup2
WHICH GIVEN THAT HOSPICE CARE IS

05:18:48.376 --> 05:18:51.346 region:rollup2
CARE THAT IS PROVIDED FOR THOSE

05:18:49.911 --> 05:18:51.946 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE --

05:18:51.346 --> 05:18:55.483 region:rollup2
NO LONGER ARE SEEKING CURED OF

05:18:51.946 --> 05:18:58.519 region:rollup2
CARE AND THAT OFTEN.

05:18:55.483 --> 05:19:00.221 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN IT DOES IF A THE WAY IT

05:18:58.519 --> 05:19:02.023 region:rollup2
WORKS CURRENTLY IS IF A HOSPICE

05:19:00.221 --> 05:19:03.891 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL IS THE ONE WHO MAKES

05:19:02.023 --> 05:19:05.927 region:rollup2
THE CALL TO HAVE.

05:19:03.891 --> 05:19:07.095 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORT THEN

05:19:05.927 --> 05:19:09.430 region:rollup2
THAT IS DEALT WITH THROUGH THE

05:19:07.095 --> 05:19:11.399 region:rollup2
HOSPICES CAPITATED PAYMENT.

05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:12.467 region:rollup2
AND THE HOSPICE Y. --

05:19:11.399 --> 05:19:15.403 region:rollup2
WINDS UP IT BECOMES PART OF

05:19:12.467 --> 05:19:16.938 region:rollup2
THEIR REIMBURSEMENT BUT IF A NON

05:19:15.403 --> 05:19:17.839 region:rollup2
HOSPICE PERSONNEL MAKES THAT

05:19:16.938 --> 05:19:19.807 region:rollup2
CALL.

05:19:17.839 --> 05:19:21.776 region:rollup2
AND THE PATIENT IS TRANSFERRED

05:19:19.807 --> 05:19:23.211 region:rollup2
THEN EITHER THE HOSPICE PROGRAM

05:19:21.776 --> 05:19:24.712 region:rollup2
HAVE TO EAT THE COST OF THAT.

05:19:23.211 --> 05:19:26.614 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

05:19:24.712 --> 05:19:28.016 region:rollup2
OR THE PATIENT'S FAMILY MAYBE

05:19:26.614 --> 05:19:29.484 region:rollup2
WIND UP HAVING TO BEAR THE

05:19:28.016 --> 05:19:31.753 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF IT INTERFERE IT JUST

05:19:29.484 --> 05:19:33.454 region:rollup2
INTERFERES WITH THE FLOW OF CARE

05:19:31.753 --> 05:19:34.389 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOR THE PATIENT'S FAMILY

05:19:33.454 --> 05:19:36.090 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT.

05:19:34.389 --> 05:19:37.325 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY FOR THE THE

05:19:36.090 --> 05:19:39.427 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS OF THE HOSPICE PROGRAM

05:19:37.325 --> 05:19:40.495 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

05:19:39.427 --> 05:19:44.165 region:rollup2
I THINK THE AUTHOR WANTED TO

05:19:40.495 --> 05:19:45.767 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE SCOPE QUESTION.

05:19:44.165 --> 05:19:47.735 region:rollup2

05:21:38.045 --> 05:21:39.347 region:rollup2
WHAT HE WAS ARE THURMOND YOU'RE

05:21:38.713 --> 05:21:40.448 region:rollup2
RIGHT ON THE MONEY THIS IS ABOUT

05:21:39.347 --> 05:21:42.450 region:rollup2
--

05:21:40.448 --> 05:21:43.050 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT TO PUBLIC HEALTH IS

05:21:42.450 --> 05:21:44.952 region:rollup2
NOT OF THE SCOPE FIGHT AND THE

05:21:43.050 --> 05:21:46.654 region:rollup2
LOCALLY MISS AGENCIES TALK ABOUT

05:21:44.952 --> 05:21:48.089 region:rollup2
LOCAL OPTIONAL SCOPES OF

05:21:46.654 --> 05:21:49.690 region:rollup2
PRACTICE THAT ARE AUTHORIZED NOW

05:21:48.089 --> 05:21:51.626 region:rollup2
FOR EMTS.

05:21:49.690 --> 05:21:52.627 region:rollup2
WANTS TO THE PARAMEDICS ABSENT

05:21:51.626 --> 05:21:54.262 region:rollup2
ANY LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION

05:21:52.627 --> 05:21:57.465 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS OPERATING

05:21:54.262 --> 05:21:58.566 region:rollup2
UNDER MEDICAL CONTROL OF MEDICAL

05:21:57.465 --> 05:22:00.034 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR IN THE COUNTIES --

05:21:58.566 --> 05:22:01.202 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS A PROMOTION OF

05:22:00.034 --> 05:22:04.105 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE IT

05:22:01.202 --> 05:22:06.274 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT IF

05:22:04.105 --> 05:22:08.509 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO RESPOND ON THE

05:22:06.274 --> 05:22:09.810 region:rollup2
SAME POPULATION OF FOLKS?

05:22:08.509 --> 05:22:11.646 region:rollup2
OF ORAL HOSPITALS ARE

05:22:09.810 --> 05:22:13.281 region:rollup2
DISCHARGING PATIENTS WHO END

05:22:11.646 --> 05:22:15.383 region:rollup2
RIGHT BACK UP IN THE ER BECAUSE

05:22:13.281 --> 05:22:16.784 region:rollup2
OF A FAILURE OF CONFORMANCE WITH

05:22:15.383 --> 05:22:18.586 region:rollup2
THEIR MEDICATIONS OR WHAT HAVE

05:22:16.784 --> 05:22:20.388 region:rollup2
YOU THE HOSPICE.

05:22:18.586 --> 05:22:21.422 region:rollup2
IS IS SIMPLY ABOUT.

05:22:20.388 --> 05:22:23.858 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT [inaudible]

05:22:21.422 --> 05:22:25.793 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT TRANSPORTING THEM

05:22:23.858 --> 05:22:27.995 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEIR WISHES THAT IS THE

05:22:25.793 --> 05:22:29.363 region:rollup2
WHOLE POINT OF THE HOSPICE A

05:22:27.995 --> 05:22:30.965 region:rollup2
PILOT PROJECT IN THE

05:22:29.363 --> 05:22:31.532 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATION OF THIS BILL SO

05:22:30.965 --> 05:22:33.267 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PROMOTIONAL PUBLIC

05:22:31.532 --> 05:22:35.036 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

05:22:33.267 --> 05:22:36.871 region:rollup2
THIS IS THIS IS A SERVICE THAT

05:22:35.036 --> 05:22:37.471 region:rollup2
DOESN'T EXIST FOR PATIENTS WHICH

05:22:36.871 --> 05:22:38.973 region:rollup2
IS WHY THEY'RE FALLING THROUGH

05:22:37.471 --> 05:22:39.874 region:rollup2
THE CRACKS.

05:22:38.973 --> 05:22:42.643 region:rollup2
AND I ONE MORE THING I JUST

05:22:39.874 --> 05:22:43.511 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY BECAUSE IN THE CONTEXT

05:22:42.643 --> 05:22:46.147 region:rollup2
OF YOUR QUESTION.

05:22:43.511 --> 05:22:47.181 region:rollup2
IT WAS REVISITED MAYBE --

05:22:46.147 --> 05:22:49.650 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY.

05:22:47.181 --> 05:22:50.685 region:rollup2
THESE PILOTS WERE VOLUNTARY SO

05:22:49.650 --> 05:22:52.820 region:rollup2
YOU GOT FACILITIES THAT

05:22:50.685 --> 05:22:54.655 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE IN

05:22:52.820 --> 05:22:56.257 region:rollup2
TESSA'S PROGRAM YOU CAN'T JUDGE

05:22:54.655 --> 05:22:58.392 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM.

05:22:56.257 --> 05:23:00.027 region:rollup2
THAT HAD ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY MEDI

05:22:58.392 --> 05:23:01.362 region:rollup2
CAL PATIENTS BECAUSE THEIR

05:23:00.027 --> 05:23:02.863 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT OF HIS COUNTY FACILITY

05:23:01.362 --> 05:23:04.832 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHO THEY ACCEPTED IT

05:23:02.863 --> 05:23:06.434 region:rollup2
WASN'T BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING

05:23:04.832 --> 05:23:08.135 region:rollup2
SOME SELECTION THE FIELD AND

05:23:06.434 --> 05:23:09.170 region:rollup2
DIVERTED THAT PATIENT POPULATION

05:23:08.135 --> 05:23:10.638 region:rollup2
SO THE DATA CAN TELL LOTS OF

05:23:09.170 --> 05:23:12.640 region:rollup2
STORIES.

05:23:10.638 --> 05:23:14.675 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT.

05:23:12.640 --> 05:23:16.410 region:rollup2
THE THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR

05:23:14.675 --> 05:23:18.379 region:rollup2
HAS NO INTEREST IN THIS PROJECT

05:23:16.410 --> 05:23:19.947 region:rollup2
EXCEPT TO SUGGEST IS THIS THE

05:23:18.379 --> 05:23:21.983 region:rollup2
RIGHT THING FOR A COMMUNITY

05:23:19.947 --> 05:23:23.351 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTER COMMUNITY BENEFIT.

05:23:21.983 --> 05:23:23.951 region:rollup2
AND THE FIREFIGHTERS BELIEVE IT

05:23:23.351 --> 05:23:25.152 region:rollup2
IS WHICH IS WHY WE ARE BEFORE

05:23:23.951 --> 05:23:35.129 region:rollup2
YOU.

05:23:25.152 --> 05:23:36.063 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON EVENING NIGHT.

05:23:35.129 --> 05:23:37.932 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND WHAT --

05:23:36.063 --> 05:23:39.400 region:rollup2
THIS MOMENT JUST SAID ABOUT YOU

05:23:37.932 --> 05:23:40.901 region:rollup2
KNOW THESE FACILITIES ONLY

05:23:39.400 --> 05:23:42.236 region:rollup2
ACCEPT MEDICAL PATIENTS BUT I

05:23:40.901 --> 05:23:43.537 region:rollup2
WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT IS DONE BY

05:23:42.236 --> 05:23:45.439 region:rollup2
DESIGN.

05:23:43.537 --> 05:23:46.407 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE IN YOU CAN TREAT

05:23:45.439 --> 05:23:49.010 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

05:23:46.407 --> 05:23:50.578 region:rollup2
THAT BASICALLY ONLY ACCEPTS MEDI

05:23:49.010 --> 05:23:52.013 region:rollup2
CAL PATIENTS AND IF THAT'S NOT

05:23:50.578 --> 05:23:54.348 region:rollup2
THE CASE IN THIS WAS OPEN TO

05:23:52.013 --> 05:23:55.950 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WE LOOKED AT THE DATA

05:23:54.348 --> 05:23:58.486 region:rollup2
1% OF THAT POPULATION.

05:23:55.950 --> 05:24:00.154 region:rollup2
GOT A BIT THE ARE PRIVATE PAY.

05:23:58.486 --> 05:24:00.721 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD TO THESE

05:24:00.154 --> 05:24:02.857 region:rollup2
FACILITIES SO IT'S DONE BY

05:24:00.721 --> 05:24:04.492 region:rollup2
DESIGN WHETHER IT'S NOT THE

05:24:02.857 --> 05:24:06.260 region:rollup2
CHARGER THAT'S NOT THE INTENT IS

05:24:04.492 --> 05:24:07.995 region:rollup2
DONEBY DESIGNS WITH INHERENT IN

05:24:06.260 --> 05:24:08.963 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

05:24:07.995 --> 05:24:10.731 region:rollup2
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S

05:24:08.963 --> 05:24:11.365 region:rollup2
A LOOPHOLE IN SECTION THIRTEEN

05:24:10.731 --> 05:24:12.867 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED

05:24:11.365 --> 05:24:14.101 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE

05:24:12.867 --> 05:24:17.138 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A TOTAL FIX.

05:24:14.101 --> 05:24:19.140 region:rollup2
SO THIS DOES NOT PROMOTE PUBLIC

05:24:17.138 --> 05:24:21.442 region:rollup2
HEALTH WE BELIEVE WE BELIEVE

05:24:19.140 --> 05:24:23.444 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAD WHOLESALE PATIENTS

05:24:21.442 --> 05:24:24.478 region:rollup2
DECIDING YOU KNOW BY THEIR OWN

05:24:23.444 --> 05:24:26.013 region:rollup2
VOLITION THAT THEY'D WANT TO

05:24:24.478 --> 05:24:27.181 region:rollup2
TAKE PART OF THESE PILOTS WHO

05:24:26.013 --> 05:24:29.016 region:rollup2
HAD HOLE SO COMMUNITIES.

05:24:27.181 --> 05:24:31.118 region:rollup2
PERMANENTLY FOLKS OF COLOR THAT

05:24:29.016 --> 05:24:32.553 region:rollup2
DECLINED THESE PILOTS IT'S NOT

05:24:31.118 --> 05:24:33.587 region:rollup2
REFER REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA

05:24:32.553 --> 05:24:34.922 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE

05:24:33.587 --> 05:24:36.724 region:rollup2
SHOULD MOVE PUBLIC POLICY IN A

05:24:34.922 --> 05:24:37.892 region:rollup2
FASHION THAT'S NOT REFLECTIVE OF

05:24:36.724 --> 05:24:38.926 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

05:24:37.892 --> 05:24:40.061 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT SOCIAL

05:24:38.926 --> 05:24:41.529 region:rollup2
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

05:24:40.061 --> 05:24:42.930 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE

05:24:41.529 --> 05:24:43.497 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN YOU PRESENT

05:24:42.930 --> 05:24:45.299 region:rollup2
WITH SICKLE CELL AND OTHER

05:24:43.497 --> 05:24:47.268 region:rollup2
ISSUES SO FOR ABOUT PUBLIC

05:24:45.299 --> 05:24:49.303 region:rollup2
HEALTH WE NEED TO BE MOVING

05:24:47.268 --> 05:24:49.970 region:rollup2
POLICIES THAT BEST.

05:24:49.303 --> 05:24:52.807 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SUIT THE PATIENT AND WE

05:24:49.970 --> 05:24:53.841 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T THE RIGHT WAY WE'VE

05:24:52.807 --> 05:24:55.343 region:rollup2
AGAIN SHOWED YOU SOME MODELS

05:24:53.841 --> 05:24:56.944 region:rollup2
THAT WORK.

05:24:55.343 --> 05:24:58.412 region:rollup2
OUR MEMBERS ARE DOING THIS THIS

05:24:56.944 --> 05:25:00.614 region:rollup2
THIS TRIAGE AND WE WOULD BE OUT

05:24:58.412 --> 05:25:01.716 region:rollup2
A RATIO SO IF WE CAN PUT A NURSE

05:25:00.614 --> 05:25:02.116 region:rollup2
ON THE TRUCK WE WOULD BUT WE

05:25:01.716 --> 05:25:03.317 region:rollup2
CAN'T.

05:25:02.116 --> 05:25:04.752 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

05:25:03.317 --> 05:25:06.253 region:rollup2
IS A NON STARTER FOR US AND THAT

05:25:04.752 --> 05:25:07.755 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BAD FOR PATIENT SAFETY

05:25:06.253 --> 05:25:09.156 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T HAVE AN RN JUMP ON THE

05:25:07.755 --> 05:25:11.025 region:rollup2
TRUCK INTO THE ASSESSMENT BUT

05:25:09.156 --> 05:25:12.360 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE SAID IS.

05:25:11.025 --> 05:25:14.261 region:rollup2
IN THE LOT OF THESE CASES IN

05:25:12.360 --> 05:25:16.030 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS TODAY THERE

05:25:14.261 --> 05:25:18.432 region:rollup2
ARE SYSTEMS THAT WORK THAT

05:25:16.030 --> 05:25:20.434 region:rollup2
REDUCE WAIT TIME THAT REDUCE

05:25:18.432 --> 05:25:21.602 region:rollup2
WALL TIME AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE

05:25:20.434 --> 05:25:23.070 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE PRACTITIONER

05:25:21.602 --> 05:25:24.105 region:rollup2
DOING THE ASSESSMENTS THAT TO

05:25:23.070 --> 05:25:25.639 region:rollup2
TRIPLE WHEN.

05:25:24.105 --> 05:25:27.241 region:rollup2
WE PASS THOSE THINGS AROUND THAT

05:25:25.639 --> 05:25:28.242 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE THE PROPONENTS AND

05:25:27.241 --> 05:25:29.744 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH IT DOESN'T MEAN

05:25:28.242 --> 05:25:31.579 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A GOOD THING.

05:25:29.744 --> 05:25:33.714 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

05:25:31.579 --> 05:25:35.182 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD MODEL AND TESTED IN

05:25:33.714 --> 05:25:37.551 region:rollup2
SOME CASES COMBAT KAISER MARINO

05:25:35.182 --> 05:25:39.186 region:rollup2
VALLEY SIXTY SEVEN MINUTES TO

05:25:37.551 --> 05:25:40.354 region:rollup2
TWELVE MINUTES USING POSITION

05:25:39.186 --> 05:25:43.290 region:rollup2
ARE IN MODEL.

05:25:40.354 --> 05:25:44.625 region:rollup2
IN OTHER CASES FOUR TO SIXHOURS

05:25:43.290 --> 05:25:47.395 region:rollup2
WERE REDUCED TO ONE TO TO THAT.

05:25:44.625 --> 05:25:48.963 region:rollup2
DOOR TO PHYSICIAN AND OUT THE

05:25:47.395 --> 05:25:51.298 region:rollup2
DOOR I THINK I THINK THAT'S

05:25:48.963 --> 05:25:52.133 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT

05:25:51.298 --> 05:25:53.701 region:rollup2
THANKS TO THE PARTICIPANTS THANK

05:25:52.133 --> 05:25:57.638 region:rollup2
YOU MISTER CHAIR.

05:25:53.701 --> 05:25:59.740 region:rollup2
IF YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE.

05:25:57.638 --> 05:26:01.308 region:rollup2
SEEING NO.

05:25:59.740 --> 05:26:03.811 region:rollup2
ONE JUST TO CLOSE ALL WILL SAY

05:26:01.308 --> 05:26:05.546 region:rollup2
IN CLOSING IS THE TERROR.

05:26:03.811 --> 05:26:07.248 region:rollup2
BERMAN MADE A POINT ABOUT.

05:26:05.546 --> 05:26:10.384 region:rollup2
GROUPS THAT CARE DEEPLY ABOUT

05:26:07.248 --> 05:26:12.153 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA.

05:26:10.384 --> 05:26:14.021 region:rollup2
THIS HAS CAUSED ATTENTION.

05:26:12.153 --> 05:26:17.158 region:rollup2
WHICH I DON'T LIKE.

05:26:14.021 --> 05:26:18.058 region:rollup2
THE MEETING IN MY OFFICE.

05:26:17.158 --> 05:26:19.026 region:rollup2
THIS WEEK WAS AT LAST WEEK A

05:26:18.058 --> 05:26:20.127 region:rollup2
CAMERA PURSUANT.

05:26:19.026 --> 05:26:23.130 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO GET AND LISTEN TO

05:26:20.127 --> 05:26:24.131 region:rollup2
THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE.

05:26:23.130 --> 05:26:25.900 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET THE PARTIES TO

05:26:24.131 --> 05:26:27.368 region:rollup2
FIGURE IS A PLACE.

05:26:25.900 --> 05:26:28.769 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MUCH SMARTER ON THIS

05:26:27.368 --> 05:26:30.404 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT I DON'T APPEAR BEFORE

05:26:28.769 --> 05:26:31.038 region:rollup2
HEALTH COMMITTEE OFTEN.

05:26:30.404 --> 05:26:33.240 region:rollup2
BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS COMMON

05:26:31.038 --> 05:26:34.842 region:rollup2
SENSE IN THE NOTION OF TRYING TO

05:26:33.240 --> 05:26:37.144 region:rollup2
DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO

05:26:34.842 --> 05:26:38.779 region:rollup2
PROMOTE COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINE.

05:26:37.144 --> 05:26:40.081 region:rollup2
AND AVOIDING THIS PROBLEM

05:26:38.779 --> 05:26:42.316 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WILL TIME OR WHATEVER

05:26:40.081 --> 05:26:44.552 region:rollup2
BUT JUST BASIC GOVERNMENT COST

05:26:42.316 --> 05:26:45.920 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN GET STUFF DONE IN A

05:26:44.552 --> 05:26:47.321 region:rollup2
MORE INTELLIGENT WAY.

05:26:45.920 --> 05:26:48.889 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS

05:26:47.321 --> 05:26:51.225 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IN THE PROPOSAL.

05:26:48.889 --> 05:26:52.526 region:rollup2
LOCALS CONTROL IN THE PROPOSAL

05:26:51.225 --> 05:26:54.595 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT CLEARLY THERE'S SOME

05:26:52.526 --> 05:26:56.430 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT

05:26:54.595 --> 05:26:57.665 region:rollup2
TO INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THAT

05:26:56.430 --> 05:26:59.834 region:rollup2
MEANS IS.

05:26:57.665 --> 05:27:01.302 region:rollup2
TO ARM THE PROPER LEVEL OF CARE

05:26:59.834 --> 05:27:03.037 region:rollup2
I'M NOT STOPPED WORKING ON THIS

05:27:01.302 --> 05:27:04.972 region:rollup2
BILL.

05:27:03.037 --> 05:27:06.440 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS THING KEEPS PASSING

05:27:04.972 --> 05:27:07.741 region:rollup2
OR NOT I'M CONTINUING TO LISTEN

05:27:06.440 --> 05:27:08.943 region:rollup2
AND TO TRY TO LEARN AND TO TRY
