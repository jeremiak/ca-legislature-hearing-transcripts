AB SIX SIXTY EIGHT WOULD PROTECT IMMIGRANTS IN ALL CALIFORNIANS FROM CIVIL REST AT A COURTHOUSE WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS ATTENDING A COURT PROCEEDING OR HAS LEGAL BUSINESS IN THE COURTHOUSE. THE ENGLISH COMMON LAW PRIVILEGE FROM ARREST DATES BACK TO AT LEAST THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY WELL COMMON LAW PRIVILEGE FROM ARREST HAS A LONG HISTORY IN BOTH ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES IT HAS FALLEN OUT OF USE IN MODERN LAW. LARGELY BECAUSE CIVIL RESTED BECOME LESS COMMON. AS A RESULT FAMILIARITY WITH THE COMMON LAW PRIVILEGE AGAINST CIVIL RIGHTS HAS FADED AMONG LEGAL PRACTITIONERS AND JUDGES. ALTHOUGH TRADITIONAL CIVIL REST MAY HAVE DECLINE THEY HAVE NOT ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED TRUST BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AS CRUCIAL. TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS THAT KEEP CALIFORNIA'S SAFE. ABOUT ONE IN FOR CALIFORNIANS IS AN IMMIGRANT ACCORDING TO TWENTY SIXTEEN ESTIMATE BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE OF XENA PHOBIA FROM THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION T IS A MORE CRITICAL THAT ARE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES HAVE A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST WITH INSTITUTIONS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. FEAR WITHIN THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY INCREASES WHEN STATE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE ENTANGLED WITH FEDERAL IN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. THIS MAY RESULT HESITANCY BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO INTERACT WITH STATE AGENCIES AND CLAIM EARNED BENEFITS OR REPORT VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. CALIFORNIA MUST PROTECT AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO VISIT THE COURTS AND PARTICIPATE COURT PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT FEAR OF ARREST. NOTHING IN THIS BILL WILL PREVENT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER FOR MAKING A CRIMINAL REST IN A COURTHOUSE IF THERE IS PROBABLE CAUSE THAT THE TARGET A PERSON COMMITTED A CRIME WHAT THE ARRESTING OFFICER WITNESS CRIMINAL CONDUCT. THIS BILL SEEKS TO REMOVE THE THREAT OF CIVIL REST AT THE COURTHOUSE TO ENCOURAGE MEMBERS OF THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY TO ENGAGE IN PARTICIPATING COURT PROCEEDINGS WHICH SERVES THE PUBLIC INTEREST OF CALIFORNIANS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE ABOUT. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. CHRIS RESPONSE WHICH OF THE COALITION FOR HUMANE MMIGRANT RIGHTS PROBABLY BE A SPONSOR THIS MEASURE WHAT CHIRLA HAS THE DEPORTATION DEFENSE UNIT LEGAL SERVICE UNIT IN ADDITION TO HAVING A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER.

ON WITH HIM TO COURT AND SPECIFICALLY JUST. TO PAY FOR A PARKING TICKET ARE TO GO TO A HEARING FOR THEIR LOVED ONES -- IT'S SO THERE IS FEAR LAST YEAR WE SEEN ABOUT THREE ARRESTS ARE IN COURT HOUSES HERE AND ARE CALIFORNIA WHAT SPECIFICALLY YOU'RE IN SACRAMENTO WHICH DID HAVE A A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. THEREFORE THAT'S WHY WE ARE OP PRADA SPONSOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS ONE IS SHERMAN ALBERTO TRICK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APPLICANT ATTORNEY ASSOCIATION ALSO CORRESPONDS TO THE MEASURE. ONE OF THANK THE THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS THE WHICH MISTER CHAIRMAN YOUR STAFF. I DON'T WANNA REPEATING THE I'M SURE OF DOCTORS COVERED THE BILL BUT AS I REPRESENT TOPPING ATTORNEYS WE HAVE THE WE REPRESENT THE MOST IMMIGRANTS IN CALIFORNIA OF ANY ASSOCIATION. AN ARCTIC SPURS OF OUR TURNS BEEN SIMILAR TO WHAT'S BEEN SAID TODAY THAT. THERE IS A GREAT -- FEAR FACTOR THERE ISN'T GREAT TREPIDATION FROM PEOPLE GOING TO COURT AND AND TESTIFYING IN OPEN PROCEEDINGS WHETHER CIVIL OR CRIMINAL CASES SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT MEASURE. TO BRING ABOUT SOME SENSE OF CONFIDENCE FOR IMMIGRANTS THAT -- ONE REDEEM THE RIGHTS RESPECT FASHIONABLE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE.

THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ONE AB FORTY FOUR THIS FRIEDMAN WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR STONE A MEMBERS. TO BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE THREE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THE ANALYSIS INCLUDING. PAGE EIGHT REGARDING FEDERAL PREEMPTION PAGE NINE MOVING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE BILL BACK A YEAR. TO JANUARY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND PAGE ELEVEN ADDING TRADITIONAL BEFORE TRIBAL CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL PURPOSES. AB FORTY FOUR WOULD MAKE IT UNLAWFUL TO SELLER MANUFACTURE A NEW FOR PRODUCT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF PASSED CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE FIRST IN THECOUNTRY TO BAN THE CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY FOR TRADE WITHIN ITS BORDERS. FOR IS NOT A BY PRODUCT OF THE MEAT INDUSTRY IT COMES FROM ANIMALS AT OUR FACTORY FARMED OR TRAPPED IN THE WHILE PURELY FOR FASHION. FOR FARMING AND THE FUR TRADE ARE LARGELY SELF REGULATED. IN THE U. S. THERE ARE NO FEDERAL LAWS FOR PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR ANIMALS HELD ON THESE FARMS AND FERBER ANIMALS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO HUMANE SLAUGHTER RULES. TODAY THERE ARE A VARIETY OF HUMANE ALTERNATIVES BOTH IN TERMS OF PHùFOR THAT IS VIRTUALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM REAL FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TEXTURE TEXTILES THAT ARE JUST AS WARMER FASHIONABLE AND A LOT MORE FUN. COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE FUELING INNOVATION AND NEW AND SUSTAINABLE FABRICS RETAILERS SUCH AS GUCCI MICHAEL CORES JIMMY CHOO ARMANI BURBERRY AND SHOULD NOW HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO GO FOR FREE AS HAVE MANY OTHERS. SEVERAL CITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO WEST HOLLYWOOD AND BERKELEY HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A STAND BY PASSING ORDINANCES MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO SELL TRADE OR MANUFACTURE FOR WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES. THERE'S NO REASON FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO PARTAKE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT PUTS ANIMALS THROUGH SUCH SUFFERING FOR NONESSENTIAL MEANS AND JUST TO BE CLEAR OUT OUR BILL DOES NOT AFFECT LEATHER. IT DOES NOT AFFECT IN -- FOR A THAT IS A BY PRODUCT OF ME PRODUCTION GO TO CAL. A AND SHEEP SO THOSE FOR PRODUCTS WILL STILL BE ALLOWABLE UNDER THE BILL. WHICH IT AB IS SUPPORTED BY THE GAP HUGO BOSS PATAGONIA RETAILER H. AND M. STELLA MCCARTNEY SUSIE AND JACK WELCH MERRICK ERIC GARCETTI AND OVER SIXTY OTHER DESIGNERS RETAILERS AND ORGANIZATIONS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB FORTY FOUR IS PJ SMITH WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY AND MARK CHING FOUNDER OF ANIMAL HOPING LEGISLATION. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK THANK YOU THE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU SIMPLIFICATION AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS PJ SMITH AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF FASHION POLICY FOR THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES A PROUD COAST BOUNDS. COSPONSORED AB. FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF NIGHT STATES IN OUR SUPPORTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON HIS HIS WHOLE HISTORIC BILL. FOR A DECADE I'VE WORKED WITH BRANDS AND DESIGNERS FROM PUCCI MICHAEL CORES AND CHANEL'S TO TJ TO TJ MAX TO CREATE POLICIES. HELPANIMALS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THESE COMPANIES EXAM I'M IN THE FUR TRADE EVERYDAY CLAIM EVERY CERTIFICATION SCHEME THEY QUICKLY REALIZE THERE'S NO WAY TO HUMANELY SOURCE? FOR THAT'S WHY SO MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE NOW GOING FOR FREE. AS CONSUMER AWARENESS GROWS THE FUR INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO ROLL OUT INDUSTRY FUNDED MARKETING SCHEMES TO GREEN WASH ITS TRADE. THE LATEST IS CALLED FOR MARK BUT NO MATTER WHAT THEY CALL IT EVERY TIME HIS FAILED TO ADDRESS EVEN THE MOST SERIOUS ANIMAL WELFARE CONCERNS. UNDER FOR MARKING SIMILAR SCHEMES WILD ANIMALS ARE STILL CRAMMED IN BEARING CAGES FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. THEY'RE STILL CAUGHT LEG HOLD TRAPS FOR DAYS WITHOUT FOOD WATER AND THEY STILL DIE BY ELECTROCUTION THE LIST GOES ON AND NUMEROUS INVESTIGATIONS OF THE SHOW THAT CERTIFIED FARMS ARE STILL RANT THAT WAS SELF MUTILATION AND OTHERS BEHAVIORS THAT ARE CAUSED BY STRESS AND FEAR. THE FUR INDUSTRY COULD CHOOSES TO CREATE SMOKE STREET YOU SMOKE SCREENS RATHER THAN PREPARE FOR CONSUMERS CHANGING CHECK TAKES. IN FACT JUST LAST YEAR WHEN INTERNATIONAL FOR FEDERATION WAS TRYING TO PROMOTE FOR AS ETHICAL ECOLOGICAL FRANCES INDEPENDENT ADVERTISING AUTHORITY CALL THOSE CLAIMS MISLEADING AND ABUSIVE IN EVEN BASED ON LIES. THE THIRTIES ALSO SAID NUMEROUS RELIABLE REPORTS SHOW THAT THE PRODUCTION OF FOR IS EXTREMELY CRUEL INCLUDING IN THAT THE FINAL PRODUCT CONTAINS TOXIC SUBSTANCES. TODAY'S CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA CARE ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE THE ENVIRONMENT AND INNOVATION MORE THAN EVER IN FASHION BRANDS ARE RESPONDING BY ANNOUNCING FOR FREE POLICIES. AND DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS THEY HAVE THE SAME LOOK AND FEEL AS FOR WITHOUT THE CRUELTY ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. THIS IDEA RESONATES WITH CONSUMERS AND THROUGHOUT THE FASHION WORLD AND NOW CALIFORNIA CAN CAPITALIZE ON THE GROWING MARKET WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB FORTY FOUR CALIFORNIA WILL SOLIDIFY ITS POSITION AS THE NATION'S MOST INNOVATIVE AND HUMANE STATE. AND WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS MARCHING I'M FROM A GROUP CALLED ANIMAL OPEN LEGISLACIóN -- PART OF OUR HISTORY AS A GROUP IS WE'VE GONE ON THE COVER IN TWO DIFFERENT FACTORIES AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND FOR FARMS ACROSS THE US AND CANADA AND CHINA IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THE CLAIM THAT MUCH OF THE VIDEO SEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE FABRICATED OR OUTDATED AN OLD. AND BASED ON THAT FACT IS A MISREPRESENTATION TO THE FOR INDUSTRY. WHY WERE SO PASSIONATE IS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE MYSELF I'VE BEEN INTO FOR FARMS AND CHINA FINLAND WHICH IS -- NUMBER TWO EXPORTER -- FOR IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AS WELL. AND I CAN TELL YOU THERE IS NO STANDARD THERE IS NO HUMANE WAY. TO SKIN A FOX. A MANY OF THESE FOXES ARE ELECTROCUTED IN STUNNED. SOME BEAT IN THE HEAD. I'VE SEEN THE CAGES THAT THE BREAD INTO AND LIVE THEIR WHOLE ENTIRE LIVES NEVER TOUCHING GROUND. I'VE WATCHED THEM. KILL THEM IN MASSES -- WHEN I WAS IN CHINA IN THIS PLACE CALLED HE BAY WHICH IS? A HUGE EXPORTED TO THE US. FOR FOR THERE WAS A BUYER FROM NEW YORK THERE. AND IN A MATTER OF MAYBE TEN MINUTES IT KILLED FIVE THOUSAND FOXES. AND THEY PUT THEM IN THESE PILES. THESE FOXES THEY DON'T USE THE MEAT THEY REYES ONLY FURTHER SCANS. AT THE END WHEN THEY STARTED TO PREPARE THEM TO RIP YOUR SKIN OFF YOU COULD HEAR THEM SCREAMING. AND WHILE IT'S NOT INTENTIONAL FOR THEM TO BE ALIVE MANY OF THEM STILL WERE -- WE'VE TAKEN VIDEOS AND WE'VE SHARE THESE WITH MEMBERS OF VAST WE'VE. I USED IT IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE BAN FOR AS WELL. THEY TALK ABOUT. HAVING A STANDARD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CRUELTY SEEM LIKE THAT THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN REGULATE A TYPE OF INDUSTRY. THAT INVOLVES SUCH IN HUMANE AND CRUEL METHODS. AND WE ASK FOR YES VOTE BASED ON THE FACT THAT. COMPASSION ESPECIALLY IN OUR STATE. HAS TO COME FIRST SO I THINK WE AS CALIFORNIANS ARE PROGRESSIVE AND WERE ETHICAL AND THE CONSUMERS ARE ASKING FOR CHANGE. AND I THINK. IT'S TIME AND WE ARE READY AS A PEOPLE AND I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER THAT. AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. RIGHT ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE.

I'LL TAKE THREE THE MORNING GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BUT SALAS STERN OF KELLY DRIVE MORE AN LP. DRIVE REPRESENTS THE INTERNATIONAL FOR FEDERATION FOR COMMISSION USA AND THE FUR INFORMATION COUNCIL OF AMERICA. I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN WHY AB FORTY FOUR IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL FIRST AND FOREMOST AB FORTY FOUR IMPOSES A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE THE SUPREME COURT IN THE MOVIE CRESSMAN. EXPLAINED THAT FOR A LOT TO NOT RUN AFOUL OF THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE ITS PRINCIPAL OR PRIMARY EFFECT MUST BE ONE THAT NEITHER ADVANCES NOR INHIBITS RELIGION AND IS THAT YOU MUST NOT FOSTER AN EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT ENTANGLEMENT WITH RELIGION. BY EXCLUDING FOR PRODUCTS USED FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES FROM ITS OTHERWISE COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON YOU FIRST THE LAW UPRIGHT THE LOTS PRIMARY EFFECT IS TO ADVANCE RELIGION BY ALLOWING THE PURCHASE AND USE OF NEW FOR ITS FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES ONLY. FURTHERMORE BY EXCLUDING RELIGIOUS FIRST FROM THE BAND AB FORTY FOUR WILL NECESSARILY FOSTER AN EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT ENTANGLEMENT WITH RELIGION THE BILL'S LANGUAGE IMPOSES A RELIGIOUS TEST BEFORE ALLOWING THE PURCHASE OF A FOR PRODUCTS A RELIGIOUS TEST WHICH MUST BE ADMINISTERED BY STATE AGENCIES. THE SUPREME COURT EXPLAINED IN HERNANDEZ WE COMMISSIONER THAT PERVASIVE MONITORING FOR THE SUBTLE OR OVERT PRESENTS A RELIGIOUS MATTER IS A CENTRAL DANGER AGAINST WHICH WE HAVE HELD THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE GUARDS. SUCH PERVASIVE MONITORING IS CLEARLY PET PRESENT HERE FOR THIS REASON ALONE AB FORTY FOUR IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT THERE ADDITIONAL REASONS WHY AB FORTY FOUR DOES NOT PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. JASMINE SANDERS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WRITER RECENTLY EXPLAINS QUOTE AS SOON AS BLACK WOMEN COULD AFFORD TO BUY MINK COATS WHITE SOCIETY IN WHITE WOMAN SAID FOR WAS ALL WRONG FOR BOTH AND PASSE. HE DISTRICT MILLION OUNCES OF AB FORTY FOUR RELEASED YESTERDAY UNDERSCORES MISS SANDERS POINTS THE ANALYSIS STATES THAT THERE ARE NO CA EQUAL PROTECTION CONCERNS RELATED TO AFRICAN AMERICANS BECAUSE AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE BILL AT ALL BUT THAT IS EXACTLY THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM. BUT FEELING TICKETS BY FAILING TO CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF AND THE IMPACT ON THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AB FORTY FOUR VIOLATES THE US CONSTITUTION'S MANDATE OF EQUAL PROTECTION. THE SUPREME COURT HAS EXPLAINED THAT WHEN EQUAL PROTECTION COUNSELOR JUST LEGISLATION IS BASED ON RACE AT THIS WILL BE THE LEGISLATION IS SUBJECT TO STRICT SCRUTINY AB FORTY FOUR CANNOT WITHSTAND STRICT SCRUTINY. AT THE BUILDING NOW CITY RELEASED YESTERDAY ADMITS AB FORTY FOUR IS BASED ON SCATTERSHOT ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PROVEN IN FACT THE NOW TO SUBMITTED THAT THE QUOTE FREQUENCY OF THE PRACTICES UNQUOTE ALLEGES A QUOTE ON CLEAR. UNQUOTE AND STATISTICS ABOUT THE ALLEGED ARMS ARE QUOTE NOT READILY AVAILABLE ON THESE FACTS AB FORTY FOUR COULD NOT SURVIVE AN EQUAL PROTECTION CHALLENGE THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS EXPRESSIVE CONDUCT. BIKE BY THE CREATORS OF FOR PRODUCTS BUT THE SUPREME COURT HAS EXPLAINED THAT THE CONSTITUTION LOOKS BEYOND THE WRITTEN OR SPOKEN WORDS AS MEANS OF EXPRESSION. AND ANDERSON THE HERMOSA BEACH THE NINTH CIRCUIT HELD THAT THAT TO IN ITS PURE PURELY EXPRESSIVE. ACTIVITY FULLY PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT APPAREL CREATED WITH FOR CLOTHING THAT IS MADE TO BE SOLD AT HIGH END BOUTIQUES AND AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE CLEARLY HAS THE SAME FIRST THE MEMBER PROTECTIONS. IMPOSING UNIFORM BAN ON THE SALE OR DISPLAY OF CLOTHING CREATED WITH FOR VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT SUCH LEGISLATION IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER CLEAR NINTH CIRCUIT ANSWER PM COURT PRECEDENT. DUE TO TIME CONSIDERATIONS I'LL ADDRESS JUST ONE MORE CONSTITUTIONAL FACTOR HERE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MORE THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN RECOGNIZING THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF AB FORTY FOUR THAT IS A GERMAN COMMERCE CLAUSE THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. ARGUES THAT THE DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE WOULD NOT BE IMPLICATED BECAUSE THE LAW IS QUOTE INDISCRIMINATE ON QUITE AS TO WHETHER IT IMPACTS IN STATE OR OUT OF STATE FOR FARMERS MANUFACTURERS. BUT THE ANALYSIS ALSO ADMITS THAT QUOTE FEW IF ANY FOR FIRMS ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE BILL SHOWS THAT THE BILL WILL HAVE AN INTENDED EFFECT ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THIS MAKES AB FORTY FOUR UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS VIOLATIVE OF A DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE THE FUR INDUSTRY WHICH IS ALREADY HIGHLY REGULATED SHARES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS HOWEVER EIGHTY FORTY FOUR IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE WITH IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S WITH US PLEASE HI THERE MY NAME IS NICOLE SMITH FROM STUDIO CITY. I'M STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE SPELL -- AS A STYLIST I REPRESENT THE VOICES OF HUNDREDS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN WHO CHOOSE FOR AS THE DISCRETION OF THEIR CULTURAL HERITAGE -- WE FEEL MARGINALIZED AND JUST BECAUSE WE CHOOSE FOR HER WE SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR THAT IT IS A LONG HISTORY OF THE COMMUNITY. AND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHEN IS THIS MARGINALIZATION GONNA STOP. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE. A GOOD MORNING KEEP KAPLAN WITH FELLOW CALIFORNIA FOR INFORMATION COUNCIL OF AMERICA THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK THIS MORNING. AND HAVE THE FOR INDUSTRY WE SHARE THE CONCERNS ANIMAL WELFARE THAT EXPRESSED AN A. B. FORTY FOUR BUT THE CURRENT ORDINANCE IS FLAWED. IT'S BASED ON DECADES OLD FAKE STUDIES AND VIDEOS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN PROVEN TO BE STAGED THERE ARE CARVE OUTS FOR SOME FOR TYPES AND CERTAIN CULTURAL GROUPS. BUT WHAT'S LEFT IS ARBITRARY AND PERHAPS LEGALLY INDEFENSIBLE. WE TO WANT TO KEEP BAD PLAYERS ON THE MARKET. BUT THE BAND IS NOT THE ANSWER A BAND SIMPLY SENDS CONSUMERS OUT OF CALIFORNIA TO PURCHASE FOR CALIFORNIA LOSES JOBS AND TAX REVENUES. AND IN THE END THE BAND HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT ON ANIMAL WELFARE BUT WHAT A BAND DOES DO IS IT TAKES AWAY THE CONSUMERS RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO PURCHASE RENEWABLE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS LIKE NATURAL. FOR AS OPPOSED TO SYNTHETIC FIBERS THAT VIOLATE THE VERY CORE VALUES OF SUSTAINABILITY. PRODUCTS LIKE FAKE FOR THAT OUR PETROLEUM BASED NON BIODEGRADABLE AND POSE AN ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT SO REAL THAT EVEN HERE IN YOUR OWN ASSEMBLY YOU'VE BEEN PRESENTED WITH A MICROFIBER BILL. AND AS YOU KNOW THE ANALYSIS THE CONSUMERS HAVE SPOKEN FIRST SALES IN THE U. S. INCREASED OVER 50% BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE US MANUFACTURED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FOR PRODUCT. WE PROVIDED THE AUTHOR OF AB FORTY FOUR WITH AMENDMENT THAT WILL ADDRESS ANIMAL WELFARE ON A GLOBAL SCALE. IT IMPLEMENTED ME HOLD ON PLEASE WE GET AT EXCUSE ME THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR OTHERS TO WEIGH IN WE WOULD YOU. EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU YOU ARE BEING WELL AMPLIFIED OKAY THANK YOU. IT IMPLEMENTS A PROGRAM CALLED FOR MARK A CERTIFICATION PROGRAM GUARANTEES HIGH STANDARDS OF ANIMAL WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMED IN WILD FOR SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS THIRD PARTY MONITORED AND USES THE LATEST IN BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE TRACEABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. CALIFORNIA COULD TAKE A LEADERSHIP POSITION LAUNCHING FOR MARK TO ENSURE MANDATORY COMPLIANCE AS IT SPREADS ACROSS THE U. S. IT WILL HAVE A GLOBAL IMPACT ON ANIMAL WELFARE. CREATING A TEMPLATE FOR ALL ANIMAL USE INDUSTRIES TO FOLLOW. IN DISCUSSIONS ON CANNABIS I'VE HEARD SOME OF YOU CLAIM THAT THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT BAD PLAYERS AN ILLICIT MARKETS IS TO LEGALIZE AND REGULATE. THAT SAME RULE APPLIES IN THIS CASE. I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE AB FORTY FOUR IN ITS PRESENT FORMAT. BANDS ARE NOT PROGRESSIVE BANDS ARE LAZY LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A BILL THAT WILL IMPROVE ANIMAL WELFARE AND IMPACTFUL AND MEANINGFUL WAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU AFFILIATION PLEASE TELL US ALL THE ON ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA GRAND VIEW DECISION ONE OF THANK THE THE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF ARE WORKING. TO GET THE AMENDMENTS THAT I UNDERSTAND ARE BEING TAKEN. ON OFF OF LIKE MARKET ANIMALS THAT ARE BEING RAISED FOR MEAT AS OFFERS A BY PRODUCT SO I UNDERSTAND LIKE RABBITS. THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED TODAY SO I WANT TO THANK THAT BUT I DO WANT TO QUESTION. THAT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED AND I'M SORRY WE'RE NOT TAKING FURTHER TESTIMONY YOU CAN JUST GIVE US YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL PLEASE WELL IF THAT'S IN THERE THEN WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE BILL AND SEE. AS POSITIONS PROGRESS THANK YOU AND THAT AMENDMENT IS NOT IN THE BILL AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATT GRAHAM BEHALF OF TAXPAYERS FOR IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY AND ALSO CAL SMALL BUSINESS OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO LET ME CLARIFY THEN SO THAT BILLS AND THAT IS NOT BEING TAKEN. AT NIGHT OKAY SO STE AT THIS POINT. CORRECT OKAY SO SORRY I GOT MISCOMMUNICATION STAFF THEN WE PUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. GREG'S 	C INTER CALIFORNIA I OPPOSE. THANK YOU. JASON WRESTLER ON BEHALF OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FAMILY OWNED MAKE FARMS IN THE UNITED STATES WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR HOLD. MORE BURKE FOR A COMMENT I I SUPPORT THE BILL. OF AND I MUST SAY THAT THE THE TESTIMONY OF THE THREE OF YOU HAVE BEEN VERY -- WILL ISSUE AND QUITE FRANKLY YOU -- ARE RATHER INSULTING -- TO SUGGEST THAT THERE'S A LITTLE CULTURAL CONNECTION TO THIS ISSUE -- TRIVIALIZES THE POINT. OF AND IT. FOCUSES ON A DIVISIVE. OF ISSUE THAT IS. NOT ACCEPTED BY ME. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE YOUR POINT MAKE IT ON A FACTUAL BASIS THAT. CAN OF THIS WAS WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER FACTUAL OF THAT IT DOES NOT SO WITH ME AND IT DOESN'T SELL WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS THAT I KNOW. AND TO USE IT IN THE WAY THAT YOU HAD I'M SURE THERE WERE OTHER ARGUMENTS THAT YOU COULD HAVE MADE. BUT TO CHOOSE -- TO MAKE IT IN THE WAY THAT YOU MADE I THINK WAS NOT HELPFUL TO YOUR CAUSE. AND QUITE FRANKLY INSULTING TO THE FOR THE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO USE TO MAKE YOUR POINT. SIDES I REJECT THE YOUR TESTIMONY I REJECT YOURS. OTHER MISTER KALRA. I SO I THINK THE AUTHOR RESEARCHER -- BUT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR SUMMER FRIEDMAN I THINK -- MACHINE AND HER STAFF CLEARLY OF WORKED REALLY HARD -- TO MAKE A EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE ALLOWING CERTAIN INDUSTRIES -- AS WELL AS THE THE RELIGIOUS -- OF FAITH BASED EXEMPTIONS -- END BUT I I THINK -- IT'S BEEN CLEAR THAT THIS SUMMER FRIEDMAN HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE AT HAND WAIT WHICH IS THE UNNECESSARY. CRUELTY -- BECAUSE TO BY -- BY THE SALE OF FIRM WITHOUT. INORDINATELY -- IMPACTING OTHER AREAS INCLUDING. THE THE THE CERTAIN INDUSTRIES -- WITH THAT -- THAT HAVE RAISED OBJECTIONS WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST INTRODUCED AS BEEN A NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN THERE I WANT TO COMMEND. THE AUTHOR FOR DOING THAT I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE AS WELL AS THE CHAIR AND AND THE THE CHAIR STAFF. OF FOR THE ACCIDENT REPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SOMEONE WOMAN FRIEDMAN I'M I'M ACTUALLY VERY SYMPATHETIC TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. UP. YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE OF FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS THAT OUR INTENTION ON TE ONE HAND WE ALL WANT -- TO ADVOCATE FOR HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. ON THE OTHER HAND FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS HUMANS HAVE KILLED ANIMALS FOR THEIR FLESH. AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS ADVOCATING HERE THAT WE COMPLETELY ABANDON THE PRACTICE OF USING AN ANIMAL PRODUCTS FOR ANYTHING. SO WE'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE NEEDLE. IN -- AS WE DO WITH THE CONSUMPTION OF ANIMAL FLESH WHERE WE HAVE REGULATIONS FOR HUMANE WAYS TO REAR THESE ANIMALS AND TO SLAUGHTER THEM -- AND I'M WONDERING WHY YOU DIDN'T TAKE THAT APPROACH WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE INTRODUCED REGULATIONS ON THE FOR INDUSTRY ABOUT HOW THE ANIMALS WERE RAISED AND SLAUGHTERED AS WE DO. IN OTHER PARTS OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY INSTEAD OF JUST AN OUTRIGHT BAN. THANK YOU AND THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION -- A LOT OF THE FOR THAT USED INCLUDING COMES FROM COUNTRIES WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO TRACK AND REGULATE. AND WE HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE TRACKING IN REGULATING. I'M THE ITEMS THAT ARE CLEARLY A PUBLIC -- HELD A PUBLIC HEALTH DANGER THINGS LIKE. LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHILDREN'S TOYS -- AND SO WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MANPOWER OR THE STAFF TO TRY TO REGULATE ITEMS THAT ARE MADE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS IS. A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS COME FROM ASIA COME FROM EASTERN EUROPE PLACES THAT YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES DON'T HAVE -- THE KIND OF NETWORK THAT WOULD GIVE US ANY SORT OF COMFORT ABOUT THE WAY THAT ON THE ANIMALS BEING RAISED BUT ALSO ONE OTHER THING WE TALKING ABOUT WILD ANIMALS THAT ARE USED IN THESE THIS FOR PRODUCTS. THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT BY NATURE THEY'RE NOT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS. IT'S MY CONTENTION THAT THE WAY THAT THEY ARE RAISED IN CAPTIVITY IS BY NATURE CRUEL BECAUSE THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT WANT TO ROME THAT WANT TO HUNT THERE IT'S NOT A COW. THAT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY HAPPY HANGING OUT EATING GRASS ALL DAY. COM THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT BY BEING CONFINED -- THE DUES DOES LEAD TO HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS I MEAN ZOOS GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO KEEP THEIR ANIMALS FOR FILLED JUST BECAUSE EVEN LIMITING THEIR ROAMING TO THE SMALL AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT THEY HAVE AN IS DUE -- IS PROBLEMATIC SOMETIMES FOR SOME OF THE SPECIES SO THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT I I DON'T THINK THERE IS A WAY OF RAISING A LOT OF THESE ANIMALS OF FOX OR MAKE THAT IS -- THAT'S NOT COOL TO THE ANIMAL AND THEN WITH BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FOOD ANIMALS THE SLAUGHTERS NOT REGULATED -- SO I JUST THINK THAT -- I BELIEVE THAT IF CONSUMERS UNDERSTOOD -- THE SUFFERING THAT WENT INTO THE GARMENTS THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO TO WEAR THEM AND I DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN EXPRESSION OF OF CALIFORNIA VALUES -- AND I THINK THAT FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE STAND AND SAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD IN OUR STATE ARE NOT DONE -- ON THE WITH THE SUFFERING OF ANIMALS THAT OF OF BEINGS THAT CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES OR DEFEND THEMSELVES IS VERY MUCH IN KEEPING WITH WHAT CALIFORNIA EXPECTS [inaudible] RIGHT BUT I I UNDERSTAND -- THIS LET ME POINT OUT THOUGH THAT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. WHERE THE BURDEN OF REGULATING A PRODUCT OF THE THE PRODUCTION OF A PRODUCT WOULD BE TOO GREAT? WE RELY ON CERTIFICATION STANDARDS FROM OTHER AGENCIES AND WE JUST REQUIRE THAT PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD HERE MEET THOSE STANDARDS -- AND AT THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE PERSON WHO SELLS THE PRODUCT TO PROVE THAT THOSE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN COMPLIED WITH AND SO I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER WAY OF OF TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. I'VE KIND OF A RELATED QUESTION AND IT -- IT IT GOES TO ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PREFERRED THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE NOT ACCEPTING AND IT'S A QUESTION THAT I HAD ALSO WHICH IS THAT IF. AN ANIMAL IS BEING RAISED FOR ITS MEAT. AND THERE IS A USE FOR ITS. FOR WHAT IT NOT BE WASTEFUL THAN TO DISCARD THE MEAT AND SO THESUGGESTION IS MADE THAT THE BILL SHOULD HAVE CARVE OUT AN EXCLUSION. FOR FURTHER CALL FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO ADD TO THE BILL BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE ADDED GOATS AND AND ANIMALS WHERE THAT'S THE CASE AND THE THE REALLY THE ISSUES COME AROUND RABBITS. AND THE CONCERNED WITH -- THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND FOLKS ON OUR SIDE IS THAT ARE OURS TWO FOLD FIRST OF ALL THAT A LOT OF THE RABBITS WHOSE FOR IS USE ARE NOT MEET ANIMALS. THEIR ANIMALS THEIR RABBITS THAT ARE REYES FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF FIRST OF THEIR NOT GENERALLY THE SAME RABBITS AND SECONDLY THAT. RABBITS WITH THEM SORT OF FLOOD THE MARKET -- TO REPLACE THE OTHER TYPES OF FOR AND THAT AGAIN THEY WOULDN'T BE USING ANIMALS THAT WERE RAISED FOR MEAT WE'RE STILL TALKING. TO KIND OF THE RABBIT INDUSTRY TO SEE IF THERE IS A WAY OF CARVING OUT YOU KNOW A NARROW EXEMPTION FOR RABBITS THAT ARE CLEARLY AND DEMONSTRABLY HAVE BEEN RAISED FOR FOOD. BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S NOT THIS IS NOT A BILL IT'S INTENDED TO DE FACTO. BAND THE EATING OF RABBITS THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO AND I TOTALLY AGREE THAT IF YOU'RE KILLING THE ANIMAL FOR FOOD THAT YOU SHOULD USE EVERY SINGLE BIT OF THAT ANIMAL. ON THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE KILLING OF ANIMALS JUST FOR THEIR FOR BECAUSE THAT'S WASTEFUL AND NOT SUSTAINABLE AND WE ARE AFRAID THAT THE RABBIT EXEMPTION WOULD CREATE MORE FROM MARKET TO DO JUST THAT SO WE ARE STILL. I'M IN DISCUSSIONS ON THAT ISSUE BUT AT THIS MOMENT WE'RE NOT AMENDING THE BILL -- WITH -- Là ALLOWING RABBITS. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE USE BUILDINGS FOR HERE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH -- ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO GET TO A PLACE THAT'S MORE OF A MIDDLE GROUND. THE PROBLEM IS IS THE BILL STANDS NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF US WHO WE ARE PHILOSOPHICALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE WITH YOU BUT WHEN WHEN WE'RE NOT MOVING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF MAKES IT AWFULLY DIFFICULT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. THANK YOU I I WANNA THANK YOU MS FREEMAN FOR BRING IN THIS -- BILL PLEASE TO SUPPORT IT -- WORKED ON A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES AND I DO THINK THIS IS AN IN HUMANE PRACTICE -- ESPECIALLY. WHEN IT'S CONSIDERED THERE'S NOT A NEED FOR THESE PART THERE'S THAT THERE'S NOT A -- THIS ISN'T THE ONLY ARTICLES OF CLOTHING THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE. AND I IT IT -- TO TO TO TO DEMONSTRATE AND NEEDED THAT OUTWEIGHS THE INHERENT CRUELTY THAT EXISTS IN THIS INDUSTRY -- ISN'T OCCURRING HERE. SO -- VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT A GLAD YOU'RE GLAD YOU BRING IN AT AND LOOK FOR THE SPRING ON THE FLOOR AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS [inaudible] TOGETHER. SO WE HAD THIS BILL AND WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE -- WHAT LAST WEEK LAST WEEK AND SO JUST KIND OF FOLLOWING UP AND AND I AND I'VE ACTUALLY LOOK MORE INTO THIS YOU KNOW SINCE THAT TIME? AND I THINK IT JUST MAKES ME MORE SYMPATHETIC WITH THE OPPOSITION -- BECAUSE AS AS I LOOKED INTO THIS ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE FOR COMES FROM ACTUAL FOR FARMS AND THESE ARE THESE ARE SMALL FAMILY OWNED FARMS. WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY REYES? OF THESE ANIMALS TO THEN YOU KNOW HARVEST THE FOR ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT THEY DO. RIGHT AND AND THERE'S NOT MANY CALIFORNIA. AND AND MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT BUT I MEAN MOST SUMMER OUT OF STATE. MOST THE MANUFACTURES OF THE STATE BUT THIS IS A LEGITIMATE FARMING LIVESTOCK PRACTICE -- THAT'S GOING ON IT'S AND IT IS A VERY LARGE INDUSTRY I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT PROBABLY NOT MANY OF US UP HERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT AT ALL -- WE PROBABLY NEVER EVEN BEEN TO A FOR FARM. IF I NEVER IN TALK TO ANY OF THESE FARMERS RIGHT -- IN THESE THE SMALL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES THAT NOW A HUGE MARKET COULD PUT IT IN CALIFORNIA COULD JUST BE TAKEN OFF THE MAP I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A PRETTY DRASTIC DECISION. TO MAKE WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE STATE REALLY AREN'T IN THIS ROOM. THE MADE FOR THE BET THAT MOST OF THEM LIVE IN OTHER STATES. WHO MAYBE CAN'T BE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW DURING THE WORK DAY YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS SO I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE THINGS YES YOU DON'T HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH IT. BUT US IS. THOSE OF US AS LEGISLATORS NEED TO THINK ABOUT HEY WHAT ARE THE OTHER WHAT ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVES. WHO WERE IN THIS INDUSTRY OTHER OTHER PEOPLE WERE IMPACT AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WITH THIS BILL -- BUT SO AS I AS I UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT FROM LAST TIME -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. IT'S IT IS IN HUMANE. TO RAISE ANIMALS FOR FOR ONLY. BUT IT'S NOT IF THERE REYES FOR FOOD IS THAT RIGHT. I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT IT'S BLESSED SUSTAINABLE CERTAINLY. I MEAN IS IN HUMANE OR I MEAN THIS THIS IS ABOUT A MORAL PRINCIPLE OF WERE NOT SOMETHING TO MAN HER OR NOT RIGHT. I I THINK THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANIMALS THAT FOR GENERATIONS HAVE BEEN DOMESTICATED AND ADJUST AND DO WELL IN CAPTIVITY AND THESE ANIMALS WHICH ARE ARE BY NATURE WILD ANIMALS BEING KEPT IN SMALL CAGES OR BEING TRAPPED AND LEFT. TO DIE YOU KNOW FOR MANY HOURS IN THE WILDERNESS -- AND I THINK THAT WITH THE ANIMALS THAT ARE RAISED -- IN CAPTIVITY I HAVE MORE COMFORT LEVEL THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE BEING RAISED HUMANELY AND IN KEEPING WITH. OTHER NATURES THAT THEY DISPLAY WHERE IS WITH THESE ANIMALS WITH THESE A PARTICULARLY EXOTIC FIRST WE HAVE NO REGULATION WE HAVE NO OVERSIGHT THIS IS MOSTLY HAPPENED SHE SAID OUT OF STATE AND OVERSEAS. AND I DO THINK THAT -- THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT A LOT OF THESE ANIMALS HAVE SUFFERED IN PRODUCING THE FOR OKAY SEE ABOUT DOMESTICATION I MEAN THAT DOMESTICATION IS AN AGE OLD PRACTICE RIGHT WE HAVE. SOME OF OUR MOST LOVING PETS DOGS ARE DOMESTICATED ANIMALS. THEY USED TO BE WILD AND YOU COULD SAY -- WIRE WHY ARE WE KEEPING THEM INDOORS WITH US SO WHY ARE WE KEEPING THEM OUT IN A PEN OUT. OUTSIDE OR IN THE BACKYARD WE SHOULD LET THEM ROAM FREE IN WILD BECAUSE THAT'S SO WRONG I MEAN THAT'S THE SAME LOGIC. RED DOMESTICATION IS AN AGE OLD ACCEPTED PRACTICE. AND SO NOW THERE ARE GROUPS OR DOMESTICATING. THESE ANIMALS YES IT'S IS MAYBE NEWER BUT THEY'RE DOING THEY ARE DOMESTICATING THEM HAVE YOU BEEN TO A FOR FARM. AND SEEN THAT HOW THESE PEOPLE ARE RAISING THESE ANIMALS I HAVE NOT BUT I DO HAVE THAT LEAVES YOU IN MY DISTRICT AND I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND THEIR RELATION TO HUMANS AND THEIR COMFORT BEING. KEPT IN CAPTIVITY AND ANIMALS THAT ARE WILD ANIMALS -- AND THEIR STRESS LEVEL WHEN THEY'RE KEPT IN CAPTIVITY AND RAISED IN CAPTIVITY AND THE ANIMALS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT -- IT'S BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THEY DO NOT DO WELL IN CAPTIVITY. WELL THE MEDICATION IS A PROCESS RIGHT AND SO THIS IS A PROCESS IT IS A PROCESS YOU'RE TAKING ANIMAL MAYBE THAT USED TO BE WILD AND DOMESTICATED. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE'VE DONE THAT VERY SUCCESSFULLY WITH LOTS OF OTHER ANIMALS. AND SO I'LL GET BACK TO I MEAN IS IT IS IT IN HUMANE TO RAISE A CAL. TO BE SLAUGHTERED FOR ITS BEEF AND THEN FOR ITS LEATHER IS IT. I THINK THE SUPPORTERS OF YOUR BILL OUT HERE THINK THAT IT IS. DO YOU ARE YOU ASKING ME I'M ASKING YOU I WOULD SAY IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'RE TREATING THEM WHEN THEY'RE ALIVE IT EITHER IS OR IT ISN'T IS IT WELL I I DISAGREE WITH THAT PROMISE THAT WILL THEN OKAY DIFFERENCE. LET ME LET ME COUNSELOR ASK YOUR QUESTIONS AND BATCH OF THE WAY THANK YOU ECONOMY COUNSELOR THIS IS NOT A MORE. I AM AN ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW -- BUT SEE THE THERE YOU GO YOU SAY IT DEPENDS ON WHAT HOW THEY'RE REYES RIGHT OKAY -- WHY DOESN'T IT DEPEND ON HOW THEY'RE RAISED? IF THEY'RE BEING REYES. FOR FOR COULD MAYBE REYES TO MAINLY FOR FOR AS WELL I AM. I DON'T I I THINK THAT POP POSSIBLY FOR SOME TYPES OF ANIMALS BUT FOR MANY NO I DON'T THINK SO NOT THE WAY THAT THEY ARE REYES TO MAKE IT ECONOMIC FOR THEM. THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE ANIMALS IN SMALL CAGES YOU KNOW THERE I THINK THAT THAT IS NOT HUMANE FOR ANY ANIMAL TO BE KEPT ITS ENTIRE LIFE IN A SMALL CAGE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE NATURE IS TO BE WILD I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS. WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE HUMANE PRACTICE? I WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT FROM -- DOMESTICATED ANIMALS EITHER THAT'S WHY IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE STANDARDS ABOUT THE ROOM THAT WE GIVE CHECK INS AND THE VOTERS ARE VERY CLEAR WHEN THEY PASSED THAT INITIATIVE THAT THEY WANTED TO SEE ANIMALS RAISED IN CALIFORNIA DONE IN A WAY THAT THEY FELT WAS HUMANE SO I THINK. OUR VOTERS HAVE AFFIRMED THAT THAT THEY WOULD YOU WANT THE STANDARD RATE AND THEY VOTED ON IT THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT AN INITIATIVE BUT WE DO WITH THAT I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP WE RAISE CHICKENS IN CAGES. NOW WE HAVE RULES ABOUT HOW MUCH SPACE THAT HAS TO BE. BUT CHICKENS ARE RAISED IN CAGES IS THAT IT IS THAT IN HUMANE. YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY DEPENDS ON THAT LIKE I SAID I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE FARM PRACTICES THAT I WOULD NOT CONSIDER TO BE HUMANE. AND THEIR FARM PRACTICES THAT ARE -- BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE THAT AND MUCH VAST MAJORITY OF FOR FARMS ACROSS THE WORLD FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT I'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S MUCH OF AN ATTEMPT FOR THAT KIND OF HUMANE. A RAISING OF ANIMALS. RIGHT BUT DON'T YOU SEE THAT IF I PASS YOUR BILL TODAY IF WE PASS YOUR BILL TODAY THE SAME LOGIC. CAN NOW BE APPLIED TO THE CAL CAN BE APPLIED TO THE CHICKEN ARE YOU GONNA COME. NEXT YEAR AND SAY HEY WE SHOULD BAN ALL RAISING OF CHICKENS THEIR CELL THAT'S RATHER SPECULATIVE CAN WE STAY ON THE TOPIC OF THE UNDERSIDE LIGHTING I UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION THAT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ASK HERE BUT MS FRIEDMAN AS ALL OF US HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING POLICY. FORWARD. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUT DON'T TRY AND ARGUE THE BILL IN A DIFFERENT FORM THAT IS IN FRONT OF US. MOM TRYING TO ARGUE THE IMPLICATION OF THIS BILL IS THE SAME LOGIC. I MEAN IS WOULD YOU ALSO MAKE THAT SAME ARGUMENT. FOR A BAND IN. ANY CAJUN OF CHICKENS OR VAN AND YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE. TO MAKE THAT SAME LOGIC THE BILL IS BEFORE US IN THIS PARTICULAR FORM AND ANY SPECULATION ABOUT WHERE IT MAY LEAD IS MERELY SPECULATION. I UNDERSTAND MR GALLAGHER'S ARGUMENT I DON'T AGREE WITH THE PREMISE BUT I DO UNDERSTAND HIS ARGUMENT. THANK YOU HOW ABOUT HARVESTING OF WOOL FROM SHEEP. WE SHARE SHE BETTER THEIR WALLETS ALLOWABLE UNDER THE BILL THAT'S ALLOWING WILL YES. BUT WE'RE IN THAT CASE WE ARE RAISING THAT. SHE JUST TO TAKE ITS. ITS WAR. RIGHT IS THAT. UNDER THIS BILL THAT IS A TRUE STATEMENT. YES IN THIS BILL WE ARE ABLE TO USE. MEET PRODUCING ANIMALS SHEEP GOATS HOUSE. FOR THE NOT RABBITS. RIGHT NOW NOT RABBITS WE ARE. DISCUSSING THAT'S A CONTINUING DISCUSSION [inaudible] I'M. WHAT ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THIS IS A LARGE INDUSTRY I THINK YOU POINTED THAT OUT IT'S OF LARGER INDUSTRY? AS I'VE SALAS LIKE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS OF MANUFACTURED FOR GOODS IN THE UNITED STATES. LOTS OF FARMS LOTS OF MANUFACTURING IF WE GET RID OF THIS IN BAND ONE OF THE LARGEST MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES CALIFORNIA -- THE REPLACEMENT WILL BE PHùFOR RIGHT. WHICH WE KNOW HAS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS THAT THIS FAUX FUR AS IT DETERIORATES CREATES MORE PLASTICS. IN THE WASTE STREAM WHICH I KNOW IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CARE A LOT ABOUT. I MEAN ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE PRETTY DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT IS ALSO COTTON WOOL AND I'M WEARING. WELL RIGHT NOW -- NOT FIRST SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS PEOPLE CAN WEARS CLOTHING TO KEEP THEM WARM. AND THEN THE BILL DOES ALSO ALLOW -- CAL FOR AND SHE FOR FOR WHICH A SHEARLING SO IF YOU REALLY WANT FOR YOU CAN CERTAINLY USE THOSE PRODUCTS. RIGHT BUT THE PHùFOR ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BECAUSE THIS AS THIS POLICY GOES INTO EFFECT OTHER. ALTERNATIVES ARE GONNA COME INTO THE MARKET PLACE MORE. YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THAT FAUX FUR NOW BEING MORE MORE IN THE MARKETPLACE. I THINK THAT IT'S YOU KNOW AS AS SGT SPURRIER'S ARGUMENT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FIBERS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET THERE'S A LOT OF TO I'VE SEEN PHùFOR MADE OUT OF COTTON AND OTHER THINGS AS WELL -- SO I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW. IN GENERAL I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. POLYESTER AND AND FIBER BUT I WILL SAY THAT PEOPLE PROBABLY WASH THEIR COATS A LOT LESS THAN THEY WASH THEIR YOGA PANTS. I WAS GONNA WORRY ABOUT ONE I'D WORRY MORE ABOUT THE MICRO FIBERS COMING OFF OF CLOTHING THAT'S WASHED MORE FREQUENTLY. I DON'T WASH I DON'T HOW OFTEN YOU WASH YOUR OVERCOATS BUT PROBABLY NOT THAT OFTEN AND THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE THE MICROFIBER ISSUE THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED [inaudible] OKAY. WELL LOOK I I THINK THAT THIS SHOWS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT. AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES LIKE RATHER THAN HAVE MAYBE. WHAT MIGHT BE IN A AN INITIAL EMOTIONAL RESPONSE OUT EVEN I HAD TO RESPOND MAN WHOSE EVEN WEARING FOR AT? I DON'T WEAR IT. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH BUT AS YOU LOOK INTO THIS LIKE YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO. RIGHT AND THERE IS A MARKET THERE IS A MARKET PLACE OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE ARE SAYING. DON'T DON'T USE FOR AND IT'S WORKING THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING AWAY FROM THAT. THE THE MARKET PLACES WORKING FROM THAT STANDPOINT -- BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LEGITIMATELY FARMING THEY'VE DOMESTICATED. ANIMALS -- IN A WAY THAT IS THAT HAS. AN ACCEPTED PRACTICE AND I THINK WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THAT I DO THINK THERE'S ALSO A DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE ISSUE IN HERE. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHO ARE WE AFFECTING WE'RE NOT AFFECTING OUR OWN PEOPLE WERE AFFECTING PEOPLE IN OTHER STATES. WHO ARE A BIG PART OF THIS INDUSTRY AMHERST AND WE'RE TAKING COMPLETELY OUT OF THE MARKET PLACE THEIR ABILITY TO SELL GOODS INTERSTATE -- THAT THAT ARE LEGITIMATELY RAISE THAT ARE HUMANELY RAISED. THAT ARE USED THAT ARE USING DOMESTICATION PRACTICES THAT WE ALL ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HAD THE BENEFIT OF TO THIS DAY WHEN YOU EAT BEEF. YOUR BENEFITING FROM A DOMESTICATION OF AN ANIMAL THAT WE RAISE OKAY WE RAISE IT FOR FOOD WE ALSO RESERVE FOR LEATHER. WE ALSO RAISE IT FOR A LOT OF OTHER THINGS -- INTO TO SOMEHOW LIKE THIS POINT THIS OUT ONE INDUSTRY. IT'S GONNA HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THEM WHEN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT WE HAVEN'T TAKEN THE TIME TO HEAR FROM THOSE FOLKS -- ABOUT HOW IT IMPACTS THEM ABOUT WHAT THEIR PRACTICES ACTUALLY ARE THE AUTHORS NEVER EVEN VISITED A FOR FARM. AND YET IS RUNNING A BILL IS GONNA HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE SMALL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. I THINK WE OWE THAT AT LEAST WHO DOES NOT HAVE A MOTIVE -- YOU KNOW KNEE JERK RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE AND TO TRY AND TAKE CREE WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE RESPECT A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. OF OF HOW THIS INDUSTRY WORKS. I WILL BE VOTING NO [inaudible] ADDRESS. THANK YOU AS CHAIR. THIS FRIEDMAN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO US. I THINK THE ONE THING I DO AGREE WITH WITH THIS -- MISTER GALLAGHER IS THAT OUR FIRST REACTION IS YES WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS IT'S AN INHUMANE TREATMENT. OF THE ANIMALS WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT. I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS IN SPEAKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN LOOKING FOR WAYS WHERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ADVERSELY AFFECT EVERYBODY. IN FIGURING OUT HOW WE GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND THAT'S TO STOP THE IN HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS TO STOP USING THE FOR AND TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS TO GET THERE? I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS HERE -- THE FACT THAT YOU HAVEN'T VISITED THE FORM I UNDERSTAND THAT -- MOST OF THOSE ARE OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA. AND YOU MADE A COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA LEADS AND WE DO LEAD. AND TO THE VOTERS HAVE TOLD US HOW TO LEAD IN MANY OCCASIONS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS IS ALSO THE MISTER.-TO FROM ALL THE BACK AND FORTH I JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR. THIS BILL. JUST PREVENTS THE SALE OF FOR CORRECT. OKAY BECAUSE THAT LINE OF QUESTIONS THAT WE JUST WENT DOWN WE COULD GO DOWN IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORM BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS WELL WHAT IF I WANTED A FARM OF DOMESTICATED DOGS TO START EATING AND WEARING. YOU KNOW THAT'S I'M HOPING THAT PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS EIGHT PROBABLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF ANIMALS THAN OTHER FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE I DON'T THINK DOGS BELONG INSIDE I DO HAVE A A HUGE RESPECT FOR ALL ANIMALS BEING ABLE. TO EXERCISE THEIR FREEDOM AND AND NATURAL STATE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE SITUATION BY WHICH WE LIVE IN SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THIS BILL ONLY HAS TO DO. WITH WHETHER WE HAVE EVOLVED ENOUGH TO DECIDE THAT A CRUEL TREATMENT OF ANIMAL FOR A UNNECESSARY PRODUCT. SOMETHING WE CAN DO WITHOUT THAT IS IN FACT. JUST A SYMBOL OF OF DECADENCE. REALLY IN OUR SOCIETY AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE NEED TO KEEP WARM ANYMORE BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER IT IT'S EIGHTY FASHION. STATEMENT A STATEMENT OF WEALTH I'M REALLY NOT CONCERNED EIGHT AT A SPIRAL THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO AS MAYBE MY A MY COLLEAGUE I THINK ON THIS QUESTION IT'S VERY CLEAR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I I WANNA YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EFFORTS ONE BILL AT A TIME AS WE BRING THEM FORWARD IF THEY MAKE SENSE AND NOT GO DOWN SOME BIZARRE. DISCUSSION ABOUT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND HOW WE DOMESTICATED ANIMAL ON WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD EAT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS BECAUSE I THINK THAT GETS US IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAT'S REALLY GROSS. SO -- AYE AYE AYE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US AND I HOPE WE ARE IN THIS DISCUSSION SAM [inaudible] MR. TO WAS ACTUALLY A MAKE. PRETTY MUCH THE SAME POINT -- I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DEBATE THIS TOO MUCH LONGER EXCEPT. THE SUGGESTION THAT DOMESTICATION SURE WOULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR THE JUSTIFICATION OF SKINNING DOGS OR CATS I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM YUBA CITY I WANT TO SAY THAT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL HAS VISITED A FARM THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN IN HUMANE OR CORE PRACTICES DOESN'T SUGGEST THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE THAT WE BANNED SUCH. CRUEL AND HUMANE PRACTICES AND I THINK THAT IS A PERSPECTIVE THAT I SHARE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF INDICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION. TODAY -- ON ARGUMENTS THAT. DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER LET ME JUST SAY IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE VIOLATING DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE. AND FOR ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION IF YOU COULD PLEASE READ THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BECAUSE COMMITTEE STAFF TO SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME. TO GO THROUGH WHAT THE COMMERCE CLAUSE DOES OR DOES NOT DO THIS BILL APPLIES TO ALL FOR PRODUCTS ORIGINATING ANYWHERE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE MANUFACTURED OR REYES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE STATE. SO THERE IS NO BASIS FOR DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE OBJECTION AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT WOULD COME FROM SIMILARLY THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS BILL WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION. AGAIN -- THE BILL LAYS OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE ARGUMENTS ARE FOR IT. WE CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE A DISPUTE ABOUT IF THE BILL PASSES A LOOK FOR TO SING THAT CHALLENGING COURT UP BUT INVOKING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY INVOKING. FIRST AMENDMENT. IS IS IS TRULY BEYOND WHAT I THINK. THE COURTS HAVE SAID IN THIS AREA ONE FINAL COMMENT I DO HAVE FOR THE AUTHOR WHICH IS I DO UNDERSTAND THERE'S A DISCUSSION. WITH -- THE RABBITS INDUSTRY ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN THIS AREA MY UNDERSTANDING IS AT THIS TIME AS I THINK YOU SAID RABBIT MEAT IS NOT VERY POPULAR. SO THE CONCERN IS IF RABBIT FOR BECOMES REALLY THE SOLE MAJOR KIND OF FOR THAT'S ALLOWED IN CALIFORNIA IT WILL POTENTIALLY DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF RABBITS WERE KILLED AND INSTEAD OF RABBITS BEING RACE FOR ME. THEY COULD BE GRACED FOR FOR SOME MORE RAISE RABBITS WOULD BE RAISED FOR SLAUGHTER. I HAVE TO ADMIT I I I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL MINUTES ON THIS I DO HOPE AND I KNOW YOU WILL. ABOUT THIS VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHETHER WE WOULD ALLOW A FUTURE EXEMPTION IN THIS AREA AT THIS MOMENT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD SUPPORT -- BUT OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS IS A BILL PROCEEDS ALL THAT BEING SAID HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND IF THERE HAS NOT YET BEEN IN MOTION HAPPEN TO MAKE THAT MOTION THERE HAS BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MS FRIEDMAN -- BASED ON THIS CONVERSATION I LOOK FORWARD TO MISTER GALLAGHER SUPPORTING OUR EFFORTS. TO ADDRESS MICRO FIBERS AS A PLASTIC WASTE AND SAID CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A LOT OF US ARE INTEREST IN THAT TOO SO I LOOK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THEIR AS FAR AS THAT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSES AYE I FIND THEM TO BE VERY CREATIVE. VERY INTERESTING. THAT DOES NOT MAKE THEM TRUE NOR NECESSARILY DISPOSITIVE OF IT ANYTHING THAT'S BEFORE AS THE ANALYSIS I THINK LAYS THAT OUT PRETTY CLEARLY. MISREAD MENU MAKE CLOTHES I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ACTIVISTS WHO TOOK THE TIME TO COME TODAY TO EXPRESS THEIR PASSION FOR THIS ISSUE WHEN THEY WERE COME AND THEIR COMPASSION AND HUMANITY-- I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH MR GALLAGHER THAT I HAVE NOT VISITED A FOR FARM BUT ONE OF MY WITNESSES HAD AND DID TELL YOU WHAT HE SAW WITH HIS OWN EYES AND I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL THINK ABOUT THAT. AND LASTLY I'LL JUST SAY IN CLOSING THAT MICHAEL KORS AND GUCCI BOTH. ATTEMPTED TO GO IN FINE HUMANELY REYES FOR PRODUCTS TO USE AND CAME BACK AND SAID THAT AFTER A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF FOR PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT HUMANELY RAISED FOR EXISTED. SO -- WITHOUT I WOULD ASK FOR YOU TO PASS AND I BOUGHT TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHAO. CHIU AYE CHIU AYE GONZALEZ. CONSULT I HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FONG. MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE NO PETRIE-NORRIS. PETRIE-NORRIS I REYES AYE REYES AYE. THAT BILL IS OUT. THANK YOU LET'S GO BACK TO ITEM NUMBER TWO MS GONZALEZ AB ONE SEVENTY LET'S -- I'M SORRY MR JONES SAWYER IS WAITING PATIENTLY SO WE NEED TO GO. TO MISTER JONES SAWYER. SO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN A. B.. TEN NINETY ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE MISTER CHAIR THIS IS JONES SAWYER. BANK SO YOU HAVE TO BILLS BEFORE US YES I'M A TAKE TEN NINETY ONE FOR ANY ONE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN THANK YOU YES AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I THOUGHT PUBLIC SAFETY WAS REALLY INTERESTING BUT WELCOME TO JUDICIARY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB TEN NINETY ONE WOULD EXTEND AN IMPROVING EXISTING LAW THAT ALLOWS PARENTS TO SUSPEND THEIR CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS WHILE THEY ARE INCARCERATED. UNDER CURRENT CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM -- WHEN A PARENT FAILS TO MAKE A TIMELY CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT THAT AMOUNT BECOMES DEBT IN HIS CHART 210% INTEREST RATE ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION? INCARCERATED PARENTS MAKE EIGHT TO NINETY FIVE CENTS AN HOUR. IN OUR STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES SINCE MANY CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS THAT INCARCERATED PARENTS SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD IF THE CENTRAL TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM BY PREVENTING APPARENT FROM ACCUMULATING DEBT. DURING INCARCERATION IS THIS THE LAW ALLOWS FOR THE SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS UPON INCARCERATION HOWEVER THIS LAW IS SET TO SUNSET JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY AB TEN NINETY WILL REMOVE THE SENSE THAT THEY TO MAKE THIS PERMITS PROGRAM PERMANENT. THIS BILL ALSO MAKES TO IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING LAW THAT KNOWLEDGE THE CHALLENGES FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND YOU INDIVIDUALS SPACE AND REENTERING SOCIETY. FIRST AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AB TEN NINETY ONE GIVES PARENTS THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS RESUME BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED OFTEN FACE GET DIFFICULTY FINDING EMPLOYMENT. IN FACT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG FORMALLY INCACERATED PEOPLE HOVERS AROUND 27%. AND 60% IN THEIR FIRST. YEAR POSTS INCARCERATION SECOND AB TEN NINETY CLARIFIES THAT THE SUSPENSION OF CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS BEGINS FROM THE FIRST DAY OF A CAR SERRATION FOR ELIGIBLE PARENTS. MEMBERS THIS BILL WAS STRANDED FAMILIES AND IN CYCLES OF POVERTY AND INDEBTEDNESS AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE RE ENTERING THE COMMUNITY WITH ME TODAY. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE DOCTOR LYNN HANEY PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY. AND ESTEBAN NUNEZ -- WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM. COALITION. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU -- I PRESIDENT HANEY FROM YORK AND I'M HERE ON YOUR COAST -- BECAUSE FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS I'VE HAD A NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRANT AND I'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS POPULATIONS OF PARENTS WHO ARE CARS RATED WITH CHILD SUPPORT -- DEBT AND I'VE DONE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HUNDREDS OF INTERVIEWS AND OBSERVED OVER A THOUSAND CHILD SUPPORT CASES. AND IN THE WORK I'VE REALLY BEEN STUNNED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THIS POPULATION OF PARENTS -- AND REALLY THE LACK OF ATTENTION TO IT -- PARENTS ACCUMULATE ENORMOUS CHILD SUPPORT AT WHEN THEY GO TO PRISON. IN MY RESEARCH THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT A PRISONER HAS WHEN HE OR SHE MOSTLY HE IS RELEASED IS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- THAT'S ABOUT THREE TIMES THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF CHILD SUPPORT DEBT FOR LOW INCOME PARENTS -- AND IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS WHY THIS OCCURS -- WHEN INCARCERATED PARENTS GO TO PRISON THEY HAVE OR WHEN THEY'RE IN PRISON THEY HAVE REALLY NO WAY TO PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS -- AS A MEMBERJUST MENTIONED THEY IF IF THEY GET A JOB MOST OF THEM ARE -- INVOLUNTARILY UNEMPLOYED BUT IF THEY DO GET A JOB IT'S ALWAYS UNDER ABOUT A DOLLAR AN HOUR. AND THEIR CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS AVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. SO THE DEBT IS IS IS OBVIOUS HOW WOULD A CRUISE -- AND I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT HAS THIS THIS SORT OF PROVING OF DEBT HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN AND LATINO MEN. WHO AS WE KNOW ARE OVER REPRESENTED AMONG -- IN OUR PRISON POPULATIONS -- SO WHEN THEY GET OUT -- PARENTS WHO ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PARENTS -- THE THE EFFECTS REALLY CAN BE DEVASTATING FOR THEM OF THE STAFF IT REALLY WAYS THEM DOWN. IF YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF DEBT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU WERE SUBJECTED IN THE IN CALIFORNIA TO AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT MEASURES LIKE THE REVOCATION OF YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE WHICH THEN MAKES IT HARD TO FIND EMPLOYMENT. LAKE MANDATORY WAGE GARNISHMENT SO IF YOU DO FIND A JOB. YOUR WAGES ARE ARE GARNISHED -- TO A POINT THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET -- AND LEANS ON BANK ACCOUNTS AND PROPERTY THAT ALSO MAKE IT HARD TO STABILIZE YOUR LIFE AND IN TURN ALL OF THAT THEN CAN LEAD. TO RECIDIVISM -- AS PARENTS GO UNDERGROUND TO AVOID THIS AND EVEN TO CRIME -- JUST LITERALLY TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND THEN ALL OF THIS HAS A REALLY NEGATIVE TOLL ON CHILDREN THE MIX CO PARENTING VERY DIFFICULT GIVEN -- THE KIND OF COMBINATION OF OF GUILT AND PRESSURE THAT PARENTS FEEL. SO FROM MY RESEARCH -- THE I'VE I'VE CONCLUDED THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE CYCLE FROM HAPPENING IS TO STOP THE DEBT FROM ACCRUING IN THE FIRST PLACE -- AND THAT WOULD BE A MEASURE LIKE TEN NINETY ONE SO I SUPPORT IT FULLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS WITH CANNOT ESTABA OR NOT I'M NOT MY NAME IS ROBERT WHEN I AM. A MEMBER OF A RC I DECIDED TO BE TODAY BECAUSE THIS SPECIFICALLY PERSONAL. AFFECTS ME. I MYSELF AM A FORMERLY INCARCERATED INMATE FROM A CDC ARE ALWAYS INCARCERATED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I JUST PAROLED AUGUST THIRTEENTH OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I DO HAVE ONE CHILD. AND I JUST LIKE AS A DOCTOR AND A SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU. HAVE WENT THROUGH THESE TROUBLING THINGS -- WITH TRYING TO BE A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY BUT BETTER YET A FATHER TO MY SON. OF THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS MORE CORPORATION IRON RICH MYSELF IN OVER FIVE HUNDRED HOURS A SELF HELP. I SPENT TWO AND A HALF YEARS -- AT CHUCKLE ALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. OPERATED WITH OVER -- TWENTY FIVE CERTIFICATIONS -- FROM STATE FAR TRAINING C. STI THINGS AS SUCH. I CAME HOME. AND I WAS STILL FACED WITH MANY BARRIERS WITH CHILD SUPPORT I HAD A FULL TIME JOB. OF WITHIN FOUR DAYS OF BEING HOME. AND MY WAGES AUTOMATICALLY STARTED ME TOOK AN I CONTACTED CHILD SUPPORT ON MY CASE WORKER. WAS REALLY REALLY -- IMPRESSED THAT I HAVE REACH OUT TO HIM TO TRY. TO UTILIZE THEM AS MY BIGGEST RESOURCE. I DID HAVE TO FIVE FOR MY LICENSE BACK I HAD TO PAY SIGNIFICAN AMOUNT. BEFORE I WAS INCARCERATED MY SON WAS ONLY ONE YEARS OLD -- I OWED A LITTLE BIT OVER SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS WHEN I GOT INCARCERATED I DID FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK TO WHERE THEY COULD NOT CHARGE ME MY MONTHLY. RATE OF CHILD SUPPORT HOWEVER THE INTEREST THAT WAS ACCUMULATED OPERATED WITH OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OF OF DEBT. NOTHING SIGNIFICAN AS THE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND HOWEVER I WAS STILL FACED WITH MANY OF OBSTACLES. WITH THAT I'M CURRENTLY NOW. MY BANK ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN LEVY TWICE AND THEY'VE TAKEN EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT INCLUDING THE BANK FEES THAT THEY CHARGE FOR IT LEGAL PROCESSING. ALSO WITH THAT A MY WAGES ARE GARNISHED AND ME BEING SEVEN MONTHS OUT OF PRISON BEING VERY RESILIENT I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP BUT THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH SIMILAR STRUGGLES. SO I JUST REALLY ASSET ON THIS LOOKED AT AND BE LOOKED AT IN GREAT DETAIL. AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE REALLY TRYING TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AND BE A GREAT FATHER. OR MOTHER WHICHEVER WHICHEVER IT IS THAT THIS JUST BE REALLY CONSIDER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COME FOR GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. MICHAEL WHAT THE ANSWER IS IT IS THE COALITION IS STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. YOU CAN LIVE THAT MICROPHONE JUST LIFTED READY TO BEND DOWN AT A VERY ON IN YEARS WITH ANTI RECIDIVISM IN STRONG SUPPORT. LOUIS BROWN JUNIOR FROM POLICY LIKE A STRONG SUPPORT. I'M MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I SING THAT IS THEIR OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL NYE I THANK YOU -- FOR TAKING CARE OF THE SUNSET I THINK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN HUMANE TREAT TREATMENT IN THE BILL BEFORE THIS IS IN HUMANE TREATMENT. AND THIS IS AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL AND TO TO BE ABLE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SECOND CHANCES OF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- ANTI RECIDIVISM EVERYTHING THAT WE LOOK AT IF WE'RE TAKING SOMEBODY WHO'S COMING OUT AND GIVING THEM THIS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT. THE MOMENT THEY COME OUT THAT IS IN HUMANE SO I I'VE MOVED TO THE RIGHT I'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL THANK YOU THERE'S A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT SAY NONE THANK YOU FOR THIS AND THE NEXT BILL MISTER JONES SAWYER. IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT KIDS ARE SUPPORTED THAT'S WHAT THAT. THE CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM IS ABOUT BUT PART OF THAT IS ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE WHO OWES CHILD SUPPORT AND THAT CHILD AND I OFTENTIMES IF WE'RE TOO STRICT WHICH SEEMS LIKE IT FEELS GOOD FOR SOME REASON TO CONTINUE TO PUNISH. THEN WE DRIVE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE BILLS ARE ABOUT IS REALLY STRENGTHENING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS MAKING SURE THOSE KIDS ARE SUPPORTED THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THOSE KIDS NEED TO BE SUPPORTED. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF THIS IS THE CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM. HAS THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT ARE TRUE AND FACTUAL AND AND ON THE GROUND AND WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS SO I I THINK THIS IS A A VERY FIVE BILL AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FORWARD. AND YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MAY CHAIR MISTER JENNER SPECTER ASTRI AYE VOTE THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND MOTIONS DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. CHAU. CHIU. CHU AYE GONZALEZ [inaudible] HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA [inaudible] FONG [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN. OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE I PETRIE-NORRIS PETRIE-NORRIS I REYES AYE REYES AYE. THE BILL NEEDS ONE MORE SO I'M GONNA PUT IT ON CALL. ITEM NUMBER EIGHT IS AB TEN NINETY TWO SOME OF THE BILL. THANK YOU HAVE A MOTION IS THERE SECONDS. AND A SECOND THANK YOU THANK. AGAIN GOOD MORNING CHAIR -- OR LIKE THAT THANK THE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. ON DIE AM GOING TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I WILL BE ACCEPTED ACCEPTING THEM TODAY AB TEN NINETY TWO SUPPORT SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA POOREST FAMILIES BY LIMITING THE INTEREST RATE ON CHILD SUPPORT THAT -- TO THE STATE UNDER OUR CURRENT CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM MOST OF THE MONEY PAID BY LOW INCOME PARENTS DOES NOT GO TO THEIR CHILDREN AND CALIFORNIA FIRST FIFTY DOLLARS A NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS. PAYMENTS GO TO A FAMILY TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILD THE BALANCE GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT TO REPAY THE COST OF PUBLIC BENEFITS. INSTEAD THE MAJORITY OF THE PAYMENTS GO TO THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY BACK PUBLIC ASSISTANCE RECEIVED BY THE FAMILY WHEN A PARENT FAILS TO MAKE TIMELY CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT THEIR CREW GOVERNMENT THAT NEVER CHARGED INTEREST ONE OF THE HIGHEST CHILD SUPPORT INTEREST IN THE NATION DATA SHOWS THAT THREE POINT NINE BILLION. OF THE STATE'S OUTSTANDING CHILD SUPPORT DEBT IS UNPAID INTEREST. FURTHERMORE BECAUSE THIS DEBT IS OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT LAWS TO PROTECT AGAINST WAGE GARNISHMENT DO NOT APPLY. AB TEN NINETY TWO WERE REQUIRED TO STAY TO CHARGE ZERO INTEREST ON CHILD SUPPORT DEBT TO THE GOVERNMENT THIS BILL WILL HELP. STOP THE CYCLE OF POVERTY BY INDEED THE CONTINUAL ASSESSMENT OF COME ON COLLECTIBLE DEBT THAT IMPACTS OUR STATE SPORTS FAMILY. THERE'S SIMPLY NO REASON TO COLLECT INTEREST FROM. FORGET -- BY FAMILIES THAT WE KNOW EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP THIS INTEREST DOES NOTHING TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND CHILDREN THE STATED GOAL OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM. THIS BILL IS A CRITICAL STEPPED IN POVERTY RECIDIVISM AND REUNITE FAMILIES WITH ME TODAY AGAIN. ON THIS MEASURES DOCTOR LYNN HANEY PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS LOUIS BROWN WITH POLICY. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS YES SIR THANK YOU AGAIN -- SO IN THE RESEARCH THAT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY -- I ACTUALLY LEARNED THAT -- SO MUCH OF CHILD SUPPORT IS ACTUALLY REPAYMENT FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM DON'T ACTUALLY COMPREHEND -- THAT WINS A PARENT. PAYS BACK CHILD SUPPORT IT. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IN CALIFORNIA GOES TO THE STATE NOT TO THE PARENTS -- IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA 60% OF CHILD SUPPORT AT IS. PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PAID BACK. SO IT'S IT'S IT'S MORE THAN A MAJORITY OF OF THE CHILD SUPPORT DEBT IS ACTUALLY GO TO THE STATE THAT BY THE WAY IS THE LARGEST AMOUNT IN THE UNITED STATES -- AND WHAT'S ALSO. ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY IS -- AS A MEMBER JUST MENTIONED THAT THE THE INTEREST RATE THAT'S CHARGED ON THAT -- 10% INTEREST IN CALIFORNIA IS A VERY VERY HIGH END OF WHAT OTHER STATES DO A MANY MANY STATES DON'T CHARGE ANY INTEREST. AND MANY MANY OTHER STATES CHARGE ABOUT HALF TO ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA CHARGES -- AND THE RESULT OF THIS INTEREST -- BUT HIGH INTEREST RATE IS REALLY THE THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OF DEBT THAT I THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER -- OR THE NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF INTEREST AT THAT IS OWED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BY. POOR PARENTS BY DEFINITION RIGHT IF IF YOUR CHILD HAS BEEN ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE YOU ARE A POOR PARENT SO WE'RE ESSENTIALLY PUTTING NINE BILLION DOLLARS ON THE BACKS OF OUR I'M SORRY TO PUT. NINE ON THE BACKS OF SO IT'S EIGHTEEN BILLION IS OWED IN CHILD SUPPORT HALF OF THAT IS INTERESTS AND HALF OF THE INTEREST IS FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SO THE POINT -- WE'RE BASICALLY PUTTING THAT ON THE BACKS OF OF POOR FAMILIES. AND AS HAS BEEN SHOWN REPEATEDLY THAT IS ESSENTIALLY ON COLLECTIBLE -- IT'S IN THAT'S BAD FOR THE STATE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF ON COLLECTIBLE THAT ON THE BOOKS -- THE DEPARTED CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES HAS INFORMED ME THAT ABOUT 1% OF INTEREST THAT GETS PAID BACK EVERY YEAR 299% IS NOT PAID BACK IT JUST CONTINUES TO A CROW. WHICH IS BAD FOR THE STATE AND IT'S ALSO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE DEVASTATING FOR FOR FAMILIES AND AND PARENTS. I DISTRIBUTED THE CHART THAT I THAT I THAT I'VE CONSTRUCTED TO SHOW HOW DEBT REALLY SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL WHEN YOU CHARGE 10% INTEREST ON IT AND IT BASICALLY MAKES IT UNPAYABLE. UP AT LEAST PEOPLE IN DEBT FOREVER -- AND THEN THAT'S BAD FOR OBVIOUSLY FOR PARENTS WHO HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO PAY THE STATE BACK OVER THEIR CHILDREN. OR THE OR THEIR CHILDREN'S MOTHERS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED -- AND SO THAT'S BAD FOR MOTHERS BECAUSE THEY GET REALLY GET LESS MONEY WITH THIS INTEREST AND IT'S OF COURSE ALSO MOST IMPORTANTLY -- BAD FOR CHILDREN -- WHO RECEIVE LESS MONEY AND ULTIMATELY LESS CARE FROM THERE -- NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS. SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US WITH. A GOOD MORNING -- CHAIRPERSON STONE TO MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE -- I CAN'T CONFIRM THAT I AM LUIS BROWN JUNIOR -- AND I'M ALSO WITH POLICY LINK WE'RE NATIONAL ADVOCACY RESEARCH. RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON ADVANCING RACIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUITY FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB TO NINETY TWO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT CHILDREN DESERVE. OF THE LOVE AND SUPPORT FINANCIAL AND OTHERWISE OF THEIR PARENTS -- BUT THE PRACTICE OF CHARGING 10% COMPOUND INTEREST ON CHILD SUPPORT THE TO THE GUY -- MEANT UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL -- PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM. MANY OF WHOM ARE OF COLOR IN OUR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER STATED A CALIFORNIA CHARGES ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF INTEREST ONE CHILD SUPPORT THAT IN THE COUNTRY. HIGHER THAN TEXAS HI THE VIRGINIA HIGHER THAN EVEN MISSISSIPPI AND CERTAINLY HIGHER THAN THE STATES THAT DON'T CHARGE. INTEREST ON CHILD SUPPORT IT AT ALL I THINK THAT THE IMPACT OF THE THE HIGH INTEREST RATE IN CHILD ON CHILD SUPPORT IT IN CALIFORNIA. IS ELUCIDATED BY COMPARING THE STATE TO OTHERS -- SO FOR EXAMPLE TWO THOUSAND THREE STUDY COMMISSIONED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT. OF SHOW THAT. BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE THE LEVEL OF CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. A IN CALIFORNIA A ROSE FROM AROUND TWO BILLION TO OVER SIXTEEN BILLION. AND COMPARE TO NEW YORK. WHERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE LEVEL CHILD SUPPORT THAT WAS ABOUT TWO BILLION IN A ROSE THE ONLY THREE POINT THREE POINT TWO BILLION? AND THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS LARGELY THE INTEREST CHARGE ON CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. SO I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT TO OTHERS ARE MADE ABOUT WHY THIS IS A COUNTER PRODUCTIVE. UP POLICY BUT I WILL SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS WE KNOW THAT. AGAIN FROM AT TWO THOUSAND THREE STUDY. THAT OVER SEVENTY FIVE SAID ABOUT 75%. OF PEOPLE WHO OWE CHILD SUPPORT DEBT HAD ORDERS THAT WERE MORE THAN THEY COULD AFFORD IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN OVER 70% OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. EARN LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO WE ESSENTIALLY TACKING ON 10% COMPOUND INTEREST ON PRINCIPLE THE PEOPLE COULDN'T AFFORD. TO PAY IN THE FIRST PLACE AT LEAST A WAGE GARNISHMENT. SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSES PROFESSIONAL LICENSES WHICH IN TURN UNDERMINES PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO EARN AND PAY CHILD SUPPORT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DEBT THAT IS PAID IS PAID TO THE GOVERNMENT MOSTLY AND DOES NOT GO TO CHILDREN. IN THE SIM. CHAIRMAN STONE AS YOU AS YOU MENTION. THE INCREASE IN CHILD SUPPORT DEBT CAN HAVE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON FAMILY RELATIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN. ARMY CAUSING ESTRANGEMENT. AND SO OF THAT IS OBVIOUSLY FUNDAMENTALLY AS YOU SAID AT ODDS WITH THE SYSTEM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT CHILDREN. FAMILIES AND PARENTS SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION ESPECIALLY URGE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. I WAS IN SUPPORT. IF YOU JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION WITH.

THANK YOU. AND I AM. SINCE THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD THIS BILL BEFORE I'LL TRY TO BE RATHER BILL BACK. THANK YOU. AB MISS CHAIR MEMBERS THIS BILL. PROBABLY SEEMS FAMILIAR IT'S A REINTRODUCTION FROM LAST YEAR. WE WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T ACTUALLY -- FILE OR OR REPORT SEXUAL -- HARASSMENT WORK BECAUSE RETALIATION. AND THAT RETALIATION COMES IN FORMED A FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB HERE OF THEIR SHIFT BEING CHANGED FEAR OF SOMEHOW BEING REPRIMANDED. AND WE KNOW IN FACT FROM A FACT FINDING HEARINGS THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR THAT THIS HAPPENS MORE THAN WE'D LIKE TO ADMIT. THE LAW PROTECTS WOMEN WHO WILL FILE A LAWSUIT FROM RETALIATION IT DOES NOT. PROTECT WOMEN OR MEN WHO SIMPLY -- GO TO THEIR SUPERVISOR AND SAY I HAVE I I'M BEING HARASSED AND I'D LIKE IT TO STOP THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IT'S A PRESUMPTION. A RETALIATION IF AFTER A WOMAN OR MAN COMES FORWARD AND THEY'RE THEY'RE FIRED THEIR SHIFT IS CHANGED WHAT NOT THAT -- THEY IN FACT ARE BEING RETALIATED SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A ACTUAL REASON TO AT ARTICULATED REASON TO TO FIRE OR TO DISCIPLINE SOMEBODY. I'M IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING A CLAIM [inaudible] STEPPED. I DON'T KNOW HIS CHERRY. BY LOOKING AT STAFF YEAH THE NEXT WITNESS MATTER IMPAIRED MEMBERS CAITLYN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION I'M HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. OBVIOUSLY. THE THREAT OF RETALIATION SILENCES VICTIMS IT PUNISHES HIS VICTIMS AGAIN AFTER TAKING THE RISK OF COMING FORWARD -- BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING ELSE THAT DOESN'T GET AS MUCH ATTENTION AND THAT'S THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT IT CREATES ON THE ENTIRE WORK FORCE. SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS VERY RARELY A ONE TIME THING WHAT WE FIND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT OFTEN WE HAVE REPEAT OFFENDERS WE HAVE. WOMAN AFTER WOMAN AFTER WOMAN EXPERIENCING THE SAME KINDS OF CONDITIONS AND IF WORKERS SEE A WOMAN WHO COMES FORWARD OR A MAN WHO COMES FORWARD AND TELLS HIS STORY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND THEN THAT WORKERS PUNISH THEIR PUT ON THE NIGHT SHIFT THEY GET HOURS CUT THEY GET FIRED THAT SENDS A MESSAGE TO ALL OF THE OTHER WORKERS THAT THEY ARE NOT. ALLOWED TO SPEAK OUT AND THAT SPEAKING OUT WILL BE PUNISHED IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PASS THIS MEASURES THAT WORKERS ARE ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND TELL THEIR STORIES AND IN DOING SO. PROTECT THE REST OF THE WORK FORCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

VERY GOOD YES YOU ARE WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ELECTIONS. HI GOOD MORNING LOWER CURTIS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SAID THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS -- WITH US ON THIS LETTER ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT PROPONENTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WE OBVIOUSLY TAKE. BASS SEXUAL HARASSMENT VERY SERIOUSLY AND THE CONCERN HERE WITH THIS BILL IS MORE OF THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE ISSUE IN THAT IT'S PUT AND MENDING THE LABOR CODE LABOR CO. TWO THIRTY RETALIATION IS ALREADY PROTECTED IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING HIGHLY REGULATE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING WILL HAVE THEIR OWN REGULATIONS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN -- FAQS ON OF AND ADDITIONALLY THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO THE TO DO THE SAME SOME PLAYERS WOULD NOT THERE'S NO SAID -- AT THERE'S NO PRE EMPTION HERE THERE WOULD BE NO DETERMINATION WHAT AGENCY ACTUALLY SUPERSEDES THE OTHER. SO THEY COULD HAVE REGULATIONS REGARDING BOTH FOR RETALIATION UNDER BOTH CODE SECTIONS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. HOWEVER THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS ARE RIGHT FOR ABUSE IN THAT AND AN EMPLOYEE CAN ALLEGE THAT THEY WERE SEXUALLY HARASSED -- BEFORE A FINDING BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OR BEFORE FINDING BY THE COURT AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE ALLEGEDLY A VICTIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND THEREFORE THERE'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION -- THAT THAT EMPLOYEE ANY SORT OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THAT EMPLOYEE IS BECAUSE THEY FILED THIS RETIRE BECAUSE THEY FILED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT. AND THE CONCERN IS IS THAT IT ALLOWS FOR ABUSE OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE IN THE CAN FILE THESE FALSE CLAIMS IN ORDER TO PREVENT AND I HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SUCH A CONCERN FOR US AND PLAYERS WON'T BE ABLE TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF ABUSE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU BUT NOT ON THE ISSUE. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST THANK YOU.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR NEXT BILL I WOULD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AT AB ONE SEVENTY ONE MAY ALSO SEEM FAMILIAR WAS PART OF A A JOINT THE LAST YEAR WITH THE RETALIATION -- I WAS COMPELLED TO REINTRODUCE THIS BILL BECAUSE PAST YEARS SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORKPLACE REMAINS A PERVERSE. PERVASIVE AND PERVERSE ISSUE ACROSS INDUSTRIES -- THIS IS -- THE WRONG [inaudible] BILL. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T READ YOU'RE TALKING POINTS THE FIRST TIME. ALL RIGHT. BUT ALL OF WHAT I SAID WAS IT'S STILL TRUE -- THE MEDIA MOVEMENT IS GONE A LONG WAY TO FURTHER THE DIALOGUE ON HOW TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORKPLACE HOWEVER THE EXPERIENCES WORKERS IN HOSPITALITY AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES ARE FAR TOO OFTEN LET OUT LEFT OUT OF THAT CONVERSATION. AB ONE SEVENTY AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS TO SEEK TO PROTECT VULNERABLE LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO ARE MOST NEEDED PROTECTION AND YOU JUST HEARD THE LAST.

PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND THAT THAT YOU'RE TO MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS ABOUT A MINUTE TRANSIT UNION SAG AFTRA. AND OTHER UNITS AS WELL AS THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT ALSO WANT TO BE ON THE RECORD THAT WE ALSO QUICK TO MY ATTORNEY SUPPORT LAST BILL TO FORGET SAID [inaudible] THANK YOU. RILEY IS A GAL WITH AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN SPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TRISTEN BROWN OF THE FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ALSO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD YES HOW THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RENEE BAYARDO SO YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING LARA CURTIS ON THE OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY -- AGAIN WE ARE NOT IN ANY WAY AT PROPONENTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DO WE CAN TO CURB SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT OCCURS IN THE WORKPLACE. NOW OBVIOUSLY VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE WITNESS'S TESTIMONY HOWEVER OUR CONCERNS AGAIN. ARE THE FACT THAT THESE TYPES OF PROTECTIONS ARE ALREADY PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE LAW AND THE STATUTORY MANDATE THAT THIS BILL WOULD PRESENT -- WOULD IN THAT WOULD PRESENT DISRUPT CURRENT LAW THAT ALREADY PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR THIRD PARTIES. IF THE HARASSMENT HAPPENS BY A HOT BY AN EMPLOYER AND IT'S A BY A SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEE TO A THIRD PARTY SO OF THE HARASSMENT IS BY THE SUPERVISOR. OF THE THIRD PARTY THERE'S ALREADY LIABILITY UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. ITS STRICT LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF KNOWLEDGE IF IT'S BY AND LOWER SUPER OF NON SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEE AND IT'S OF A THIRD PARTY THEN AGAIN ITS LIABILITY IF THEY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN -- ADDITIONALLY EVEN IF IT'S BY A THIRD PARTY THEMSELVES TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THAT HIRING ENTITY THEN THERE'S LIABILITY IF THE HIRING ENTITY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS THIRD PARTY WAS -- HARASSING INDIVIDUAL. EVEN IF. THE PERSON DOESN'T ACTUALLY FALL UNDER THIS PERSON PROVIDING SERVICES PURSUANT TO A CONTRACT. THEY'RE STILL LIABILITY IF THE HIRING ENTITY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN SO WHAT AB ONE SEVENTY ACTUALLY DOES IS IT ENCOMPASSES THE SITUATION WHERE A LABOR CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE. ARE HARASSING EACH OTHER BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THERE'S NO LIABILITY OR THERE'S AND THIS WOULD ASSUME DIRECT LIABILITY JOINT LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDLESS OF ANY SORT OF CONTROL THAT THE HIRING HD HAS OVER THE WORKPLACE SITUATION. AND WOULD IMPOSE DIRECTLY ABILITY IN THOSE SITUATIONS AND THAT'S WHERE CONCERN LIES BECAUSE THEN THE HIRING ENTITY THE CLIENT EMPLOYER IN THESE SITUATIONS DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CURTAIL THE HARASSMENT BECAUSE THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT. AND THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THIS THIRD PARTY AND SO IF THERE IS CONTROL ALREADY UNDER THE LAW AND IF THERE IS A NEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. AS STANDARD THAN THAT HIRING ENTITY IS ALREADY GOING TO BE LIABLE A LAST YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED PROVISIONS OF A BILL THAT WERE PART OF THIS AND IN HIS VETO MESSAGE HE SAID THIS BILL CREATES A NEW ILL DEFINED STANDARD FOR JOINT LIABILITY BETWEEN LABOR CONTRACTORS AND CLIENT PLAYERS. AND THEREFORE AM IS UNNECESSARY TO THE EXTENT THESE NEW PROVISIONS ARE ADDED THEY ARE CONFUSING AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE CONCERNED AS WELL WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THERE IS ALREADY THE PROTECTIONS PROVIDED UNDER CURRENT LAW. AND THAT THE VISIONS ADDED BY THIS BILL -- SIMPLY AREN'T NECESSARY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT IS NOT. OF TIME JUST MADAM CHAIR YOUR BACK MISTER CHAIR SORRY ABOUT THAT -- CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION AMONG OTHER CLIENTS I WANTED. TO THIS BILL IS PATTERNED AFTER A BE -- EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN THE HERNANDEZ BILL OF A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHERE WE CREATED STATUTORY LIABILITY JOINT EMPLOYER LIABILITY. FOR NON PAYMENT OF WAGES AND FOR VERIFICATION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE. BOTH OF WHICH I GUESS WE VIEW AS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE -- ONE FOR THE CLIENT EMPLOYER TO DETERMINE QUITE READILY FROM THE CONTRACTED EMPLOYEES AND AND THEIR DIRECT EMPLOYER -- THE ISSUE OF HARASSMENT ON THE OTHER HAND IS NOT THAT OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE. SO THAT'S THE FIRST CONCERN WE HAVE THE SECOND CONCERN IS IS THAT DESPITE FIAT HAVING. BOTH NOTICE AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS -- UPON EMPLOYERS THERE IS NO SORT OF GOOD FAITH DEFENSE FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION -- I THINK YOUR COMMITTEE COUNT YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN YOUR COMMITTEE COUNSEL MISTER CLARK HAS DONE. A VERY GOOD JOB IN LAYING OUT THE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES IN EXPLAINING. I THINK THE CASE LAW AND WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS OF THE FEE OUR STATUTE. I GUESS I WOULD SLIGHTLY DISAGREE WITH ONE OF THE POINTS ALL ALL AGREE ON PAGE SIX WITH THE DESCRIPTION THAT THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF FEE HA AFTER ALL. IS NOT TO ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE WHO'S BEEN HARASSED TO SUE THE EMPLOYER. RATHER ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY LEARN OF THE HARASSMENT TO TAKE IMMEDIATE AND APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION TO STOP THE HARASSMENT. AND PREVENT FURTHER HARM A STATEMENT WHICH WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY AGREE TO IT IS THE LAW BUT I THINK THAT IS THE INTENDED PURPOSE. BUT ON THE NEXT PAGE -- THE NODE IS THAT AB -- ONE SEVENTY WILL NOT CHANGE ANY LIABILITY THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE FROM OUR STANDPOINT IN AB ONE SEVENTY SAYS. THAT THE KLA CLIENT EMPLOYER WILL SHARE BOTH RESPONSIBILITY WHICH SPEAKS TO THE FIRST POINT BUT ALSO SHARE IN THE CIVIL LIABILITY. SO I'D LIKE TO AT LEAST SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS STARTING WITH THE FIRST PROVISION IS WHERE WE SHOULD GO BEFORE IMPOSING LIABILITY AND THE LAST ITEM THAT I WOULD RAISE WITH THE COMMITTEE IS IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL REFERENCES. TO TWENTY EIGHT TEN POINT THREE AND ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS THAT IS NOT PICKED UP. IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF AB ONE SEVENTY ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND PERHAPS IT'S IN THERE. IS A EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX IN TWENTY TEN POINT THREE WHICH DEFINES THE TERM USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS BECAUSE IT DEFINES IT AS A WORK PERFORMED WITHIN OR UPON THE PREMISES. OR WORK SITE OF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER WITHOUT THAT LIMITATION THEN BOTH THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROPOSED TO BE IMPOSED BY AB ONE SEVENTY WOULD GO BEYOND THE PREMISES OF THE WORK SITE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION WITH THE CALL RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO POSE FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. MATTHEW ARNOLD WESTERN GROWERS ALSO POST. JUST PEOPLE A WITH THE CIVIL JUST SOCIUS IN CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. PRICING NONE BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MITHRAS. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES FOR BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE HERE WITH THIS GLASS IS BOTH THE NET A LOT OF ANY LOVE LOVE MOST. IF NOT THE GOVERNOR IS A LOCAL BUS HOSTED. AT ALL I GUESS THAT I'M. GONNA SEE IF THAT'S WHAT THE THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I'M SURE WE ALL SHARE. YOUR CONCERN. ASSEMBLY WOMAN WITH MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORKPLACE I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THE POINTS OF THE OPPOSITION MADE WAS I SAW YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD IT SOMETIMES AND NOT IN YOUR HEAD -- IT OTHERS AND SO I CAN TELL YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THESE ISSUES BUT THEY ARE TECH ELATED A CONCERN THAT I HAVE AS WELL WHICH IS THAT -- IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO HOLD AN EMPLOYER RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT THEY HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT AND COULD NOT OF CONTROLLED EVEN IF THEY HAD KNOWN ANOTHER WHICH TRANSMIT THAT OCCURS -- BY PERSONNEL OF THE LATE OF THE THE CONTRACTED AGENCY. OUTSIDE OF THE CONFINES OF THE WORKPLACE OF COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT SO -- THAT THERE WAS AN OVERSIGHT AT AYE AYE. ACTUALLY AS HE STATED THE A SIX ON ON SITE OF THE WORK SITE IS SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT WERE -- WE'VE BEEN CHANGING THE BILL SO WE WERE REFERENCING THE LABOR CODE WERE TAKING THE LABOR CODE NOW PUTTING IN P. HATS VERY. CONFUSING -- AT THAT'S WHY IT'S EASIER TO REFERENCE BUT NOBODY WANTS REFERENCE GOVERNMENT CALLED FROM FEE HAS SOME TRYING TO APPEASE ALL SIDES RIGHT IT'S KINDA LIKE WHACK A MOLE SO WE WE MISSED THAT ONE PIECE THAT THAT GOES BACK IN THE BILL THERE'S NO PROBLEM I DON'T KNOW IF THAT. SOME OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BUT I I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT -- THAT PIECE. OKAY IT HAS TO BE ON THE WORK SITE ON OUR SIDE ISN'T THAT MARKED UP AS PART OF THE BILL AND I DON'T THINK IT'S PART OF THE AMENDMENTS THE COMMITTEE IS OFFERED SO. UNFORTUNATELY I'VE GOT A VOTE ON THE DOOR THAT'S BEFORE ME TODAY AND SO BE IN OPPOSITION BUT CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO RE EVALUATING THAT WHEN YOU GET THAT IN THERE. I APPRECIATE THAT. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I KNOW WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE BUT THAT THE POINT OF THESE IS TO PROTECT. THAT INDIVIDUALS AND IN THE EMPLOYEES AND AND WHERE THE DIFFICULTY BECOMES WERE WHERE THAT. EMPLOYER WHO HAS A REALLY SHIP WITH THE CONTRACTORS WHO HAS CONTROL OF THE WORK SITE NEED TO STEP UP AND NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT SWEPT THAT. WORK SITE IS SAFE AND THAT THEY ARE PROTECTION EMPLOYEES REALLY CANNOT TURN A BLIND EYE. TO BAD THINGS THAT HAPPEN I WOULD EVEN ARGUE OFFSITE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS FOR THAT EMPLOYEE AND IF THEY HAVE TO BE WORKING OFF SITE. AND THEY ARE THEN THE VICTIM SO IT AYE IT'S NOT QUITE TO ME AS EASY AS THAT AND I KNOW YOU YOU WANT TO DRESS AT AND YOU CAN MOVE THAT BOARD. BUT I JUST WANT TO DRAW THAT DISTINCTION. WHERE AN EMPLOYER HAS A RELATION HAS HAS HIRED INDOORS BRINGING IN A CONTRACTOR AND ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES? IS BEING HARASSED THE COMMON DENOMINATOR THEIR ULTIMATELY IS THE EMPLOYER WHO HAS THE ABILITY. IF THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BOTH CONTRACTUALLY WITH THE CONTRACTOR BUT ALSO TAKE CARE OF THE EMPLOYEE SO TO ME. JUST. WE STILL NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE ARE PROTECTING EMPLOYEES WHO WANT TO FEEL SAFE IN THEIR WORKPLACE AND I KNOW THAT'S THE THE GOAL OF THE BILL SO I APPRECIATE THAT. IT WAS ALSO A CLOSE THANK YOU AND I'M JUST I I THINK TO CLARIFY WHY THIS BILL IS COMING ABOUT AND TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTS SITUATION. OF AND WHY WE CALLED SANDERS LAW QUITE QUITE FRANKLY AND IN THIS RESORT IN A LOT OF EMPLOYERS ARE ARE ARE THEY'VE GONE FROM NOT ONLY. CONTRACTING IN -- RANK AND FILE EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO TO THE SUPERVISOR FOR THOSE RANK AND FILE FILE FILE PLAYS AND SO WHEN THE WORKER WHO'S SUPERVISORS HARASSING THEM AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THERE AND THEY THINK THEY WORK FOR THE THE RESORT. GOES TO THE RESORT SAYS I'M BEING -- SEXUALLY HARASSED BY MY SUPERVISOR AND LITERALLY IN THIS CASE THE RESORT SAID THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM THAT'S YOUR SUPERVISOR FROM SO THE WORKER HAS NO WHERE TO GO -- THE THE EMPLOYER THE MASTER EMPLOYER KNEW ABOUT THE SITUATION HAD NO. OBLIGATION TO REMEDY HAD NO OBLIGATION -- TO TO TO DO ANYTHING IT IS A PIECE OF OF THE STATUTES IT'S MISSING NOW YES IF THERE'S A IF YOU'RE SUPERVISOR AND THERE'S AN OUTSIDE PERSON IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE TO A CONTRACT OF YOUR CONTRACTOR TO AN EMPLOYEE WELL. WHAT ABOUT A CONTRACTOR CONTRACTOR THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PLAYING WHACK A MOLE WITH THE CHAMBER AND -- FOLKS ON THIS FOR TWO YEARS NOW AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE ME LANGUAGE ON THAT THEY THINK CLARIFIES WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO WHICH IS AT SHOULD. I THINK WE ALL AS THEY WOULD SUGGEST SHOULD ALREADY BE IN LAW THEY THINK IT'S ALREADY LOTS NOT -- BUT IF THERE'S LANGUAGE THAT HELPS THEM FEEL LIKE I'M NOT GOING FURTHER THAN THE LOT. AS IT SHOULD BE I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE TO TO CHANGE -- AND ENSURE AYE AYE I AGREE WITH THE CHAIRMAN THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY SITUATIONS I'M NOT THINKING OF THAT ARE OFF THE SIDE OF THE WORKPLACE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH A VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE. THAT HAPPENS -- IN JANITORIAL IN PARTICULAR AND AT IN RESORT HOTEL WORK -- AND WE KNOW ABOUT WORKING AND WE WE WANT TO PROTECT WORKERS SO I'M GETTING A LITTLE FRUSTRATED -- BECAUSE THIS IS TWO YEARS OF LITERALLY MOVING THAT'S FROM CODE A CODE AND CHANGING ONE WORD OR CHANGING TWO WORDS TO TRY TO SATISFY. AN OPPOSITION THAT'S NEVER GOING TO BE SATISFIED AND SO -- WITH THAT ALL I ASK IS THAT WE ACTUALLY TRY TO PROTECT WORKERS AND SO I ANSWERED MY BY.

THE ONE CURRENTLY BEFORE US IS ALWAYS THE MOST WORK THOUGH. THANK YOU FOR THAT. CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SIX SIXTY NINE A BILL THAT AUTHORIZES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO USE A TYPE OF SADDAM A TOOL CALLED. AN ASSURANCE OF VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE OR ABC FOR SHORT. AND MULTISTATE CASES INVOLVING CALIFORNIA OTHER STATES OUR SISTER STATES COMMONLY USE A. B. C.'S TO SETTLE WITH DEFENDANTS OFTEN AND CONSUMER PROTECTION OR ENVIRONMENTAL. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. THE ABC. A. B. C.'S ARE GENERALLY ENFORCEABLE BY THE COURTS. UNDER THOSE STATE STATES ABC STATUTES. IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THERE IS NO EXPRESS LEGAL AUTHORITY IN CALIFORNIA LAW FOR THIS AG TO ENTER INTO AN ABC THAT IS A FORCIBLE BY THE COURT. IF THE FIT THE DEFENDANT. NOT COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT. WITH A LIMITED EXCEPTION OF TERRIBLE TRUST CASES. THIS BILL WOULD REMAIN THAT GAP AND ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENTER INTO A. B. C.'S. AND CONSUMER PROTECTION AND OTHER NON SECURITY RELATED CASES THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE THROUGH THE COURTS. UNDER THIS BILL A. B. C.'S ARE JUST AS STRONG AS STIPULATED JUDGMENTS AND CAN BE ENFORCED IN THE SAME WAY. SB SIX SIXTY NINE WILL HELP STREAMLINE SETTLEMENTS AND MULTISTATE CASES AND PREVENT UNNECESSARY LITIGATION COSTS THUS ENSURING MORE EFFICIENT USE OF DOJ RESOURCES.

AND TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES WHILE ENHANCING ENFORCEMENT ABILITIES. AND WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE BILL -- BY BRADLEY AUTHORIZING THE USE OF A. B. C.'S IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL GIVES THE AG THE ABILITY TO USE A TOOL THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IN FACILITATING SETTLEMENTS AND MULTISTATE CASES. WHERE OUR SISTER STATES ARE ALREADY USING A. B. C.'S TO DO SO? AS THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES POINT SATIN PAGE FOR ABC'S CAN SAVE TIME AND RESOURCES. I WOULD OTHERWISE BE CONSUMED IN NEGOTIATING A STIPULATED JUDGMENT. OR IN LITIGATION F. -- SUCH NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION INCREASING EFFICIENCIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT THIS BILL HELPS ENSURE THAT. FROM AN ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIANS ARE JUST AS PROTECTED AND WELL SITUATED AS RESIDENTS OF OUR SISTER STATES IF AND WHEN THE AG. ELECTS TO ENTER INTO AN ABC.
