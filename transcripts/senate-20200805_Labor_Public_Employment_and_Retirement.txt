AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME- THIS ITEM NUMBER ONE ON OUR AGENDA. ASSEMBLY BILL SIX EIGHTY FIVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES WELCOME. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE WHICH IS THE COMMONSENSE MEASURE AIMED AT PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND LOWERING EXPOSURE TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. SPECIFICALLY EXPOSURES IN THE WORKPLACE. WE'VE SEEN THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AND HOW IT HAS SHIFTED OPERATIONS FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES NATION WIDE. AT TODAY'S HEARING SHOWS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS NO EXCEPTION. THE LEGISLATURE HAS GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND TO ENSURE OUR EMPLOYEES ARE SAFE AND PROTECTED UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE HAVE THAT LUXURY OR ACCOMMODATION. EVERY DAY OUR CENTRAL WORKERS ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR LOVED ONES WHENEVER THEY GO TO WORK TO KEEP OUR STATE FUNCTIONING. IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT COPE WITH NINETEEN INFECTIONS AND DEATHS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE LATINO BLACK AND ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES. COMMUNITIES A MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF OUR STATE LOW WORKERS. DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER AS A GOVERNING BODY TO ENSURE OUR CENTRAL WORKERS ARE PROTECTED. CURRENTLY EMPLOYERS MUST REPORT FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INCIDENTS. BUT IT IS ONLY RECOMMENDED THAT EMPLOYERS REPORT REPORT INFECTIONS. THERE IS NO COMPREHENSIVE MANDATE TO REPORT EXPOSURES IN CASE PUBLICLY FOR TRACKING PURPOSES. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL WE MUST GET SERIOUS ABOUT CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING FRAMEWORK THAT WILL ALLOW WORKER PROTECTION AGENCIES WORKERS THEMSELVES AND THE PUBLIC TO COMBINE FORCES AND MINIMIZE COLLECTIVE RISK. AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE FOCUSES ON THE BASIC STEPS EMPLOYERS MUST TAKE TO CONTROL WORKSITE EXPOSURE OF COBIT NINETEEN THIS INCLUDES. IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION TO WORKERS AND UNIONS OF POSSIBLE EXPOSURE TO AN INDIVIDUAL WITH COBIT NINETEEN. NOTIFICATION TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKER SAFETY AGENCIES OF THE EXPOSURE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TRACKING EXPOSURES TO IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS. PROTECTING OUR CENTRAL WORKFORCE IS CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND TO THE RE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE IS MITCH STEIGER LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND CAITLIN VEGA LEGAL DIRECTOR WITH UFCW WORSE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND BUT DIDN'T LET ME BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES- IF ESTABLISH SOME TIME. LIMITS ON THE TESTIMONY AND DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF OUR HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND THE CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME. TO BE DETERMINED BY THE CHAIR ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY AFTER THE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND THEIR POSITION ON THE MEASURE SO WHAT WE WILL BE DOING TODAY BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF OUR AGE. IS THAT WE WILL ESTABLISH A TIME LIMIT FOR- THOSE IN SUPPORT THE WITNESSES AND THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO A TOTAL OF EIGHT MINUTES. EIGHT MINUTES FOR SUPPORT AND EIGHT MINUTES FOR OPPOSITION- SO YOUR FIRST WITNESS IS A MISTAKE OR MITCH ARE YOU THERE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURR IS MUCH TIGHTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. A CO SPONSOR THIS BILL ALONG WITH UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS AND CALLS OF COURSE LIKE TO THANK OUR AUTHORS AND MEMBER RAMPS AND CO AUTHORS FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE. WITH THE CELL THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY HUGE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE SINCE THE START OF THIS PANDEMIC AND- ENDEMIC HAS PROGRESSIVELY BECOMING MORE AND MORE OBVIOUS THAT. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE SEEING OUTBREAKS IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT WORKERS ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO RELY ON THE RUMOR MILL TO KNOW IF THERE. IS AN OUTBREAK STARTING AT THEIR WORK. AND WHAT THAT SAYS DONE IS. A LOT OF THEM A LOT OF THEM WITH. WOULD COMPROMISE. IMMUNITY ISSUES AND OTHER CONCERNS TO JUST GO TO WORK AND HOPE THAT NOTHING BAD IS HAPPENING AND THEY JUST DON'T KNOW. AND ALL THIS BILL REALLY DOES IS MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY ARE NOTIFIED. PUBLICATION OF THE NINETEEN- EXPOSURE TO COVER NINETEEN THAT THEY- NOTIFY THE WORKERS THEY NOTIFY THE UNION IN THE APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCIES SO THAT. PEOPLE COULD ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT EACH CASE FOR WORKERS. THEY CAN DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WHAT THEY WELL THE STATE AGENCIES WILL HOPEFULLY USE THAT TO. PRIORITIZE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHERE CASES ARE REALLY GETTING OUT OF CONTROL THAT THEY PAY CLOSER ATTENTION. AND ALSO JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OPPONENTS CONCERNS. AND ONES THAT WERE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON WHAT. AMENDMENT THAT MAY BE COMING SOON TO THE BILL. BUT THE BIGGEST ONE IS LIKELY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS MORE CLEAR FOR EMPLOYERS SO THAT. WE WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS.BUT DON'T SURE THAT WHEN WORKERS NOT WHEN WORKERS NOTIFY EMPLOYER. AN EXPORTER HAS A ABOUT TWO TRIGGERS IT. RIGHT NOW THE BILL BROKERAGES AND NOWHERE CHAU KNOW STANDARD THAT COMMON GROUND WORKERS COMP AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO EMPLOYERS THAT THIS ONLY APPLIES WHEN. WHEN THERE HAS BEEN THAT CLEAR NOTIFICATION THERE ARE ALSO A VARIETY OF OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE OF WHICH IS THAT. THE EXPOSURE MUST HAVE OCCURRED AT THE WORK SITE- THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO DISCLOSE ANY CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION. AND THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS OF PROGRESS ON WORK WITH PRIVACY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PERSON IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. IS NOT SUBJECT TO A PR IN REQUESTING CAN'T BE SHARED WITH OUTSIDE AGENCIES OTHER THAN COLLISION OF THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. OVERALL THE MAIN THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS JUST MAKE SURE THAT. WORKERS HAVE THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE ON THE JOB. AND WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD YOU VERY MUCH OF. A YOU HAVE A SECOND. I BELIEVE. VEGA YES MISTER BIG UP. THANK. YOU MISTER CHAIR IN NINETEEN NUMBER. OKAY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. B. W. LECTERN STATE COUNCIL WE REPRESENT MEMBERS IN MEAT PACKING PLANT AND GROCERY STORES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND WE STARTED HEARING STORIES LIKE THIS RIGHT AWAY IN THE PANDEMIC ABOUT WORKERS COMING TO WORK AND FINDING OUT THAT SOMEONE AT WORK HAD GOTTEN THEY HAD BEEN ON. THAT HOME BECAUSE THEY TESTED POSITIVE- BUT WE'RE NOT GIVEN THAT INFORMATION UNTIL THEY HAD ALREADY NOT ONLY BEEN EXPOSED THEMSELVES IN MANY CASES ON HOMES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS I KNOWINGLY EXPOSING THEIR FAMILY TO WHATEVER ADDRESS THEY WORK. TO THE WORKING SITE WE ALSO SEEN CASES WHERE NOTIFICATIONS ARE NOT MADE TO CALLOUS AT AND ARE NOT MADE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT NO ONE IN THE WHERE TO EVEN BEGIN THE CONTACT TRACING OR TO ENSURE THAT. HELLO CHAU GUIDELINES ARE BEING FOLLOWED UP WITH IN THE WORKSITE IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR UNION THAT WE STREAMLINED UNIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO THAT WE START TRACKING BY EMPLOYER WE VIEW THIS CRISIS AS FUNDAMENTALLY AND WORKER SAFETY CRISIS FAR TOO MANY WORKERS ARE BEING EXPOSED AT THE WORK SITE EITHER BECAUSE THEY AREN'T GETTING ACCESS TO KEEP PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED. THEY ARE BEING TOLD ABOUT OUTBREAK THEY ARE BEING HEARD TO LEAVE WORK WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL WELL IN SOME CASES THEY FACE RETALIATION WHEN THEY REQUEST PASSING OR WHEN THEY REQUEST ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT WORKSITE SAFETY. ALL ACROSS THE BOARD WE FEEL THAT THIS. IS AN URGENT CRISIS. ABILENE THAT THE RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AND WE CAN TRACK WHERE THE EMPLOYERS WHERE THEY INDUSTRIES WHERE WE SEE OUT AND WHERE WE NEED TO DEVELOP THE FORCES OUT OF OUR AUTHOR MENTIONED AND I WANT TO THANK OUR AUTHOR OF FOR HER INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE THIS IS KIRK THE CORONAVIRUS HASREALLY- EXACERBATED THE INEQUALITY THAT WE ALREADY FACE IN THE STATE AND FEDERALLY. RIGHT NO WORKERS BASED ON THE JOB CURRENTLY- CALIFORNIA CASES ARE ABOUT 60% LATINO DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE FACT THAT THAT YOU KNOW WORKERS BEEN MUCH LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME AND OFTEN ANY PHYSICIAN THAT REQUIRE THEM TO GO DAY AFTER DAY AND SO MANY OTHER WORKERS ARE ABLE TO SHELTER AT HOME AND BE PROTECTED FROM THE THREAT. THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT BOTH AS WORKER SAFETY CRISIS AND ALSO REALLY A RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO ACT AS A STATE TO INSURE WORKERS HAVE BEEN INFORMATION AND IN THE STATE IS ABLE TO IMPORT ARE NOT.

PERFECT AGAIN ROBERT WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE. AND THANKS AFFECT THEIR OWN L. I THINK REALLY CATCHES A LOT OF THE INDICATING CONCERN THIS BILL- AND- JUST START UP AND BEING CLEAR WE ARE NOT OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DOWNPLAY. HOLDEN NINETEEN OR BECAUSE YOU'RE OPPOSED TO PROVIDING SOME KIND OF. FEASIBLE NO- OUR CONCERN HERE IS REALLY WITH THE TAX THE BILL HAS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE FORM THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR OR WORKABLE INJURY. CONTROL FOR A SHOULD WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE. IN THE U. S. RECALL AND I. AT THE MENTION OF A TO A TO THE- YOU. AND CLARIFY TRIGGER. I APPRECIATE THAT MENTION DOES HAVE A SHARING WITH THAT SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE PRESENT BUT GLAD TO HEAR THAT THEY ARE POTENTIAL DAHLE QUALITY WITH THE TECH. PRESENT SO FIRST DEALING WITH THE TREE EXPOSURE ON THE TRIGGERING EXPOSURE TO COLD AT NIGHT OF BILL REFERENCE THINGS LIKE EXPOSURE TO SOMEONE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN NINETEEN. BUT THE BILL DOES NOT DEFINE WHAT QUALIFIES AS AN EXPLOSION- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT WE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE APPLYING TO THE WORKPLACE. AND IF I HAVE A WORKER WHO IS UNDER WORKPLACE MORE THAN TEN FEET AWAY FROM EVERYONE ELSE AT ALL TIMES. AND ORDER HERE WEARING A PROPER FACIAL COVERING COMPAGNIA. CALLOSUM DIED. BUT ONE OF MY WORK COUNTY. IT SOCIAL GATHERING AT AS NOTED BY THE I PLAY THAT THE SPOT. THE BILL HAS NOT WOMEN TO EXPOSE IN WORKPLACE BY THE KIND OF WHERE WITH THE OKAY ORDER NOR. AND pPROP BE BETTER. THIS BILL IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE WORKER PROPERLY DIDN'T IN KEEPING COMPETENT. IN MY AND HELP THAT WOULD BE. THAT MEANS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE TRIGGER IS FLIP SO TO SPEAK AND AS NOTED THAT ONLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS. TO DETERMINE IF THIS WAS A QUALIFYING. IN PROVIDER REQUIRED THAT BUT- CLEARLY APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE BRIEF TIME ON. THAT IMPROVISED LOOK TO. HOW WILL ALSO PART OF THEIR GROWTH THE CUSTOMER PRIME BECAUSE FOR CALIFORNIA PLAYERS WERE AND PLAY CURRENTLY UP FOR. PROTECTIONS FROM DISCLOSING HEALTH CONDITIONS TO A POINT THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED THAT SPONSOR MENTION THAT I'M HOPEFUL THAT THEY CAN BE RESOLVED BUTTON CONCERNED ABOUT REQUIRING POLICE TO DISCLOSE HEALTH INFORMATION- EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYERS AS WELL THE COMMISSION TO STAGING.

THE BILL PACKAGES ONE THAT ANOTHER OF BACKING. BUT BILL TECH RICK IN TO CALL MAKE READ EFFORT THAT TO NOTIFY. BEFORE BUT AGAIN WHAT THAT MEAN IN A CO NINETY CONCEPT LAST YEAR YOU KNOW YOU TO HELP A VERY LARGE AND JUST HOPE THAT. SOMETHING BEGINNING IS BACK OF THING. BUT NOW THAT NOT THE OCCURRING AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN NEED. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE. INDIVIDUAL PHONE CALLS THE REQUIRED MAIL TO. HOW DO WE FIND SURE WE MAY EVERY WE EFFORT NOT EARLY JADI THE E. OPTION TO THIS QUICK AND SCALE. WOULD BE A NEW BUT THAT HE. I WANTED. SO AND I DON'T HAVE A FIGURE I JUST KNOW THAT AIM TO WOULD BE GREAT THREE FOR A WHEN YOU GET PENALTY AND BILL. OF ANOTHER CORNER LIKE ADDED THE PRESS THIS BILL DOES REALLY SEPARATE THE GOOD IN THE ACT NOTABLY. THIS IS PERTAINING TO THE NOTE THAT. TO HELLO SHE THE PUBLICATION THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS THAT LATER SECTION OF THE BILL. PRESENTLY IN IT PROVISION. REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY SUCH. EXPOSURES THAT THEY- IN ADDITION TO THE PRIVACY CONCERNS THE MANSION GO THE CONCERN HERE IS OKAY LET ME I WOULD HAVE AND AT THE IT SAID THE WORKER CATCHES KATE CHAU RIGHT OR THEY THEY PARK OVER THERE CAN'T THEY DON'T KNOW THEY COME TO WORK FOR A WEEK AND THEY START TO SHOW SIGNS IT DID CAN BE A FOR LENGTHY. IT HAPPENED BOB. THE POINT THE EMPLOYER PRETEND THAT. EVERY CALENDAR BECAUSE- PROPERTY. A WORKER. BUT AN INVOICE AND THEN I GET CAUGHT SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAT STILL IN THE QUALIFY LOWS IN THE BILL THAT WILL RESULT IN A REPORTING. HELLO CHEF AND OPEN PUBLICATION THAT EMPLOY. YEAH I WAS EMPLOYER HAD MORE OF.

OR IN JAIL SHERIFF'S STATION OR A PUBLICLY RUN HOMELESS SHELTER RECREATION FACILITY- WHERE NOTIFICATIONS WOULD CONCEIVABLY HAVE TO BE PROVIDED. BOTH IN WRITING AND FOR ME AS OFTEN AS DALY. AT THE END OF COURSE THE RISK THAT A PUBLIC SERVANT ADMINISTERING THOSE FACILITIES WOULD FACE MISDEMEANOR CHARGES- IF NOTIFICATION WAS. DELAYED FOR ANY REASON. AND NOTIFICATION CITY THAT THE WORKERS THEMSELVES EXPERIENCE IN THESE CASES- SO NOT ONLY A WE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL. THE BRIEF TO THAT COULD LEAD BECAUSE SO THAT BUT WE'RE ALL WORRIED DAY EVEN. A SINGLE TENDER DOLLAR FINE IN CERTAIN INSTANCES COULD FORCE THE CLOSURE OF A BUSINESS THAT THEY CAN'T THAT A COUNTY BOARD OF THE PUBLIC AGENCY RELIES ON THE AND THAT SURVIVES ON A MARGIN AN EXAMPLE SUCH AS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FACILITY. THAT SERVES EMERGENCY WORKERS OR OTHER PERSONNEL OR A HOMELESS SHELTER RUN BY A NONPROFIT BUT CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON THESE. PAGES ENTITIES IN THAT GAP EVEN. AT A SINGLE VIOLATION. CAN YOU JUST WORKING. VERY CLOSELY CORPS WITH THIS. WITH OUR OWN PUB HELP TO. THAT THE BILL WOULD HAVE NOTICED. AND OF COURSE WITH OUR TEAM ST COURSE OF THE- TO KEEP THE PUBLIC ENEMY STATE.

WE STILL HAVE NOTIFY SO WE WANT TO COMMENTS AMENDMENTS TO THIS- WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT EVEN OF THE OPPOSITION THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS THESE ARE THEIR EMPLOYEES. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THEY'RE HELPING THEIR BUSINESS STEP ALIVE SO I AND I THINK THAT IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE HAVE GOOD ACTORS ARE BAD ACTORS WHAT THE EMPHASIS HAS TO BE ON THE EMPLOYEES WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE EMPLOYEES- WE ALSO ARE WORKING ON AND AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT THE TRIGGERING EVENT. IS THE EXPOSURE OF THE WORKSITE BY PERSON WITH THE BEEN DIAGNOSED AS HAVING CO BID FOR ORDER TO ISOLATE ON THE SYMPTOMS. COVERT NINETEEN. WE ARE GOING TO PROVIDE DOES NOT EMPLOYER TO DO. COMP MEDICAL INFORMATION. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT I THINK FALL UNDER BEST PRACTICES AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THESE ARE INCLUDED. THANK YOU OTHER KEPT QUESTIONS YES SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND- FIRST OF ALL IT'S WANT THANK- THE SEMI WOMEN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- APPRECIATE- BOTH HER WORK AND SPONSORS AND TRY TO BE SURE WE PROTECT WORKERS AND THAT THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT- THEY NEED TO ATTRACT YOU TO SELL STATE SENATOR FANS MICROPHONE ON- IT IS I'M NOT SURE WHAT. OKAY THE HEARING. NOW THE SOUTHWEST AREA OKAY SO ON THAT THE PROVIDER ALL RIGHT- BUT I THINK THAT. YELL AT I HEARD THAT YOUR TAKING AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS I THINK THE TRIGGERS AND SO THAT'S ONE THING I DID WANT TO TRY TO GET INTO A LITTLE BIT AND- BECAUSE AT LEAST SO FAR I'VE HEARD NO ANSWER DISAGREES WITH THE PREMISE OF THE BILL PER SE AT LEAST KNOWS EXPRESSED THAT YET I THINK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WOULD WORK. SO AND I HEARD YOU DID OUTLINE SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOUR PLANE TO TAKE AROUND THAT. I GUESS IN TERMS OF- NOTIFICATION AGAIN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THEIR TIME BE SURE EMPLOYEES ALSO ACCURATE ACTIONABLE INFORMATION RIGHT SO YOU TALKED ABOUT RUMORS AND PEOPLE HAVEN'T ACT AROUND RUMORS. SO TERM OF. ASSEMBLY SAID THIS DEBATE EMPLOYEE HAS A POSITIVE SO FIRST PERSONAL PRIDE ONE THRESHOLD WOULD BE A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. A SOMEONE WHO'S POSITIVE I GUESS ARE WE LOOKING AT SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THAT AND SO I MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU'RE IN A THAT'S A RETAIL TYPE LOCATION RIGHT WHAT IS OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC COMING IN. AND SOMEONE. NOTIFIES THE EMPLOYER RIGHT I WAS IN YOUR STORE R. I WAS YOU KNOW IN YOUR SITE. AND I'VE COME BACK POSITIVE I TESTED POSITIVE FOR A COVETED. TWO WEEKS AGO R. I WAS YOU KNOW THAT AND WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE TO DO RIGHT SO THE SENATE EDUCATION SAYING SOMEONE CAME BY TWO WEEKS AGO. FOR LAST WEEK L. BECAUSE AMERICA THE TECH THERE WAS A LACK TIME THEY GOT THE RESULTS WE KNOW SOME PEOPLE WAITING A CONSERVE AMOUNT OF TIMES SAME ALSO WITH AN- EMPLOYEE AS WELL IN TERMS OF THAT. TURNAROUND TIME IF THEY CHOOSE TO REPORT- ALSO WHEN YOU SAY POSITIVE TESTS YOU KNOW THE PCR TEST IS THE TEST THAT ACTUALLY TEST WITH THE YOU'RE ACTIVELY INFECTED. DELIVERY DISTINGUISHING THAT FROM A SEROLOGY TESTS WHICH COULD BE USED SOMETIMES. OF COULD DETECT RECENT SECTION BUT COULD BE FOR AN OLD INFECTION THE PERSON HAS BEEN RECOVERED. I REALIZE THESE ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES PERHAPS BUT- AND- I SEE YOUR BILL FOR. BUT I THINK THAT IF THERE'S EITHER SOMEWHERE TRY TO ADDRESS TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY AROUND THAT BECAUSE OF. SITUATIONS MAYBE THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED TO HER PLEASE HE'S- ACCURATE FACTS WELL IN. TION THAT THEY CAN. FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN INCORPORATE THOSE TYPES OF MECHANISMS WITH THE GUIDANCE OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ENSURE THAT ARE UP TO DISPOSE CLARITY FOR EMPLOYERS BUT ALSO THAT THE EMPLOYEES ARE GETTING INFORMATION THAT IT. FULL TO THEM ANYWAY SO- THAT THAT- INSTEAD OF PERHAPS GETTING LOTS OF NOTICES THAT THEY'RE NOT SURE HOW TO INTERPRET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR PAM I THINK THAT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT WAS RUMORS. A RUMOR IS NOT GOING TO TRIGGER THIS- WE- WE HAVE EMPLOYEES WHO TESTED POSITIVE. THOSE ARE THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOW EXPOSING THE BRICK THAT. EXPOSING OTHER EMPLOYEES ARE. THE EMPLOYEES MUST BE NOTIFIED I ABSOLUTELY WOULD TO A WELCOME THE INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HELP. IN SETTING THE PARAMETERS I THINK THAT IF WE KNOW WHO ALL OF THE DETAILS OF COPA NINETY IN AND WE KNEW WHAT THE DATE IS. IT WAS. FIRST ON NO. SO THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL I THINK T WOULD HAVE TO AND- WITH THE RECOGNIZE IS TO PROTECT THE- AND IF WE KNOW THAT SOMEBODY WAS EXPOSED TWO WEEKS AGO. THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE REPORTED BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW IF THEY'RE HOT SPOTS. SO MAYBE NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO IT BUT IT'S STILL A HOT SPOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYEE THERE THAT HAS TO GO TO CAL OSHA THAT HAS TO GO TO THE- DEPARTMENT PUBLIC. HEALTH THE- ROLFING THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH STATE CALL AND IT'S BEEN A VERY MEANINGFUL AND ROBUST DISCUSSION- WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND COMING UP WITH pFOR AMENDMENTS THAT I'VE THAT I'VE THOSE SPECIFIED HERE. THAT IS A FOLLOW UP AGAIN JUST AS QUICK FAR SO ENOUGH TO IT I THANK YOU SO MANY WOMEN- YEAH CERTAINLY I AM VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE DECKED OUT I KNOW THATYOU AND THE SPONSORS TO WORKING ON THEM. I A THERE ARE SOME NUANCES- THAT- THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE NAVIGATE BEGAN TO ACHIEVE YOUR VERY GOAL THAT YOU EXPRESSED- TO BE SURE THAT WE PROTECT EMPLOYEES AND DO SO IN A IN A MANNER THAT'S- THAT'S IT'S GOING TO BE. THAT TRULY DOES IS EFFECTIVE FOR THEM SO- CERTAINLY I'D BE YOU KNOW- I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT ALSO WANT TO. ALSO SEE THE ATTENDANCES ARE COMING FORWARD AND I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME COMPLEXITIES THAT THAT- THAT STILL. NEED TO BE WORKED OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS SO I JUST AND I WANT TO ASSURE MEMBER IS THE IN THIS. A VERY IMPORTANT BILL- I MEAN SOME OF THE STORIES WE'VE HEARD- IN SITUATIONS THAT WE FOUND EMPLOYEES HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN A BEEN BEEN VERY DIFFICULT- BUT I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF YOU DEFERRED FROM SOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY FROM THE OPPOSITION. IN NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED SO IT WILL BE A IT LOOKS AS IF WE'LL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL THAT I WILL SUPPORT THE BUILDER DAVID CERTAINLY WANT YOU TO WORK CLOSELY IF YOU WOULD WITH A COMMITTEE- AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN KIND OF REFINED AND KIND OF PUT OUR- AROUND SOME OF.

YES I DO WANT TO THANK THE- AND TO STAFF FOR THE WORK. ON THIS BILL. AND I WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE ANALYSIS. AND BY THE STAKEHOLDERS. SOME OF THOSE I'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED HERE. WE'VE BUT I DO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE MET WITH LOCAL HEALTH DIRECTORS AND TO THE EMPLOYER OPPOSITION TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE. IN ADDITION TO THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT I HAVE DISCUSSED I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT ANOTHER. AMENDMENT IS TO ADD THAT EMPLOYERS CANNOT RETALIATE AGAINST WORKERS. BASED ON THE DISCLOSURE OF POSITIVE CODE NINETEEN TEST OR DIAGNOSIS. WE'RE ALSO SEEKING FEEDBACK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THE BILL IS IMPLEMENTABLE AND TO CONSIDER WAYS TO MAKE THE DATA PUBLIC PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN A WAY THAT IT'S COST THAT IS COST EFFECTIVE.

THANK YOU NOTING THAT I HAVE FOR BILLS OR IF- IF YOU DO THEM AND AS USUAL ALL. NOT CONTROVERSIAL AND EASY TO GO. WE'LL START WITH AB TEN SIXTY SIX THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM HAS BEEN CRITICAL LIFELINE FOR WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE EXPERIENCING SEVERE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP DURING POPE AT NINETEEN. PANDEMIC SO MANY OF US HAVE A EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEMS WITH EDT RECENTLY AND I THINK OUR CONSTITUENTS- HAVE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR. WHAT THESE DELAYS HAVE DONE TO THEM BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IS THE BEHIND THE SCENES ISSUES THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE THOSE DELAYS AND YES- EDT DOES HAVE YOU KNOW A PROCESS AND ARE TRYING TO GET THROUGH A LOT OF BACKLOG. BUT IT'S MADE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE COMPANIES WHO WON'T RESPOND TO THE REQUEST. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS TWO FOLD ONE. IT TAKES A LOT OF WHAT IS ALREADY EXISTING- NPD'S PAPERWORK INTHEIR ABILITY- TO pPURSUE THINGS AND CODIFIES IT BASICALLY IT TAKES THINGS THAT YOU FIND ON FORMS REQUIRED THAT THE BUSINESSES RESEARCH INTO A- TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT FOR TEN DAYS AND KIND OF. A LAW THAT WAY THE WORKER ISN'T LEFT ON THE HOOK WHEN THE EMPLOYEE. DOES RESEARCH. WE IS. I KNOW OF SITUATION IN SOMEONE HERE ABOUT WHERE BURKE. HAVE WAITING FOR. A REASON TIME WHICH HAS BEEN THREE MONTHS BECAUSE AN EMPLOYER REFUSES TO HAND OVER WAGE INFORMATION ON THAT WORKER SO THIS JUST STRENGTHENS EDIE'S POSITION AND REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO DO THAT WE ARE TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD BE REALLY CLEAR WE TOOK SERIOUSLY- THE CHAMBERS OPPOSITION BECAUSE- WE FELT LIKE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMPLOYERS HERE WE'RE WE'RE NOT REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS FOR REGISTERING THEIR EMPLOYEES AB ET DE INTER FOLLOWING BASICALLY THE LAWS AND MIGHT MISS A FORM AND TIME. UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WE'RE TAKING. AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT THE EMPLOYERS CAN RECEIVE AN EXTENSION FOR GOOD REASON IF THEY MISS THE TEN DAY- VERIFICATION LETTER OR THEY CAN'T PROVIDED TEN DAYS THAT THEY COULDN'T GET TO THE MAIL OR SOMETHING. LIKE THAT HAPPENED- WERE ALSO CLEAR FIND THE GOOD BECAUSE EXTENSION. STILL FLIES IT IT APPLIES AND THEY CAN APPEAL THAT SO THE PEEL PROCESS IS STILL IN THERE STILL A THIRTY DAY APPEAL PROCESS. WE ARE GOING TO COMPLETELY TAKE OUT OF THE BILL- IF THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD THE PORTION ABOUT IF THIS HAPPENS MORE THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO IS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME EMPLOYERS AGREE JUSTLY DOING THIS FOR EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE. PRIMARILY OVER LEFT THEY'RE JUST NOT RESPONDING AND WE WERE TRYING TO STREAMLINE IT FOR THE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE DESPERATELY WAITING ON THAT CHECK. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT CONFUSING AND WE ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE CHAMBER AND IT'S BEST TO JUST TAKE THAT PIECE OUT. SO EVERY SINGLE CLAIM IT WOULD STILL HAVE. THE TEN DAY PROCESS BY WHICH THE EMPLOYER WHAT WOULD HAVE TO RESPOND. WHAT WHAT THIS SAYS IS WHEN THE EMPLOYER RESPONDS. WHAT DOES NOT RESPOND THAT ALLOWS THE EDG WORKER. TO ASSUME WHAT THE WORKERS TELLING THEM THAT THE EMPLOYEE IS TELLING THEM. THEIR TEN NINETY NINE FORMS ARE BANK STATEMENTS ALL THAT INFORMATION THAT THEY GAVE IS ACCURATE AS FAR AS WHAT THEIR WAGE WISE SO THAT THEY CAN GET UP TO THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO EDT WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS CLEARLY THESE INPUT WORKERS EMPLOYEES. THERE AND THEY ARE- THEY DESERVE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BUT THEY'RE GETTING CLAIMS OF ZERO DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET INFORMATION FROM THE COMPANIES SO THIS JUST SAYS IT COMPANIES IF YOU DON'T PARTICIPATE THE ET DE R. ARTICLES FORWARD AND WE HAD WE ASSUME THROUGH THE WORK WITH THE EMPLOYEE WHAT THEIR WAGES ARE SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET A CHECK. NOW THIS. ACTUALLY EXISTING LAW. I MEAN EDT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THIS IT IT EXISTS IN THEIR PRACTICE BUT WE'RE GONNA CODIFY INTO LAW. THE OTHER HALF OF THE BILL IS SIMPLY TO ALLOW. BIT EDT AND THE EIGHT EIGHT G. NOT JUST EIGHTY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO AFTER COMPANIES. WITH FIVE HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES WHO DID NOT PAY INTO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. WHAT WE KNOW IS WE HAVE HAD TO TAKE OUT A LOAN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OUR FUND IS BROKEN. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE HAVE TO PAY BACK THAT FUND BUT THAT'S NOT PUT ON SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABIDING BY THE LAW PEEN INTO YOU WHY THIS ENTIRE TIME WELL HUGE CORPORATIONS WHO HAVE REFUSED TO PAY N. ARE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND WE WANT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER THOSE CORPORATIONS- WITH HOPEFULLY THOSE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS I HOPE WE CAN MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. I KNOW THAT IT'S- HOW TO CONFUSING LIKE EVERYTHING WITH EDT- BUT WE A- WE DID TRY TO USE THE ACTUAL BURBAGE. AND THE EXPECTATIONS ALREADY LAID OUT IN EDIE'S PROCESS TO JUST CODIFY IT CAN MAKE IT MORE FRIENDLY TO THE WORKERS NOT GETTING THEIR X. GOOD OF WITNESSES.

THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES BORDER ONE IT IS OUT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND NOW IF WE COULD MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN WHICH IS AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN. THANK YOU YOU MIGHT MY FAVORITE WORK THIS YEAR HAS BEEN TRYING TO ADD CLARIFICATION AND- DO THE FOLLOW UP WORK THAT WE PROMISED AFTER AB FIVE WE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS WHEN WE STARTED BECAUSE WE HOPE TO PUSH ONE QUICKLY WE NOW HAVE JUST COMBINED THEM ALL INTO THE URGENT KERR'S THAT WE- GET IT. SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AND WE CLEAR FIGHT AND- BETTER ABOUT THEIR SITUATION. THIRTY E. AND- AFTER JUST. DOES WHAT TWENTY TWO FIFTY SEVEN DOES- TO AB FIVE BASICALLY THE AMENDMENTS THAT IT DOES IT THAT IS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. WE CLARIFIED- THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS THERE. THERE WAS THIS BILL SOME THAT TO BUSINESSES- COULDN'T CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SERVE EACH OTHER'S CLIENTS. WE CLARIFIED THAT IMPACT THE KIANA IS LONG AS THE PEOPLE SERVING THE CLIENTS ARE EMPLOYEES OF ONE OF THOSE BUSINESSES WE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW CHAIN OF INDEPENDENT. IN FOR BUSINESS SERVING CLIENTS ISN'T BUT OVER THE STATE. THIRTEEN ALL OF OUR CLIENTS IS AN IT THERE YOU KNOW THE SOLE PROPRIETOR THE DIRT THEY CAN HAVE THE TO BE REALLY. BUT THIS SAYS YES IF YOU CONTRACT WITH THE COMPANY WHICH WE ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS LONG. LETTER TO THE JOURNAL LAST YEAR SAYING THIS. I'M IN CONTRACTING A COMPANY. IT HAPPENS ALL ON HEALTHCARE. THE CAN COME IN AND CORPS. THE SAME CLIENT IN THE SAME LOCATION BUT THE PERSON IS AN EMPLOYEE THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE- WHAT WE CARE MOST ABOUT IS THAT EMPLOYEES PROTECTED. DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT MIGHT MATTER BUT IT WHO'S DOING THAT PROTECT THE PROVIDING FOR THEIR PROTECTIONS WHETHER IT'S SICK DAYS ARE- MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME AND ALL THOSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN EMPLOYER OF RECORD. THAT SHOULD ACTUALLY WILL HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD QUESTIONS UNDER AB FIVE THE THING THAT WE DID. WELL AS- YOUR ENDEAVOR OF THIS ENTIRE BILL WHICH TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A LABOUR BROKER IN A TRUE REFERRAL AGENCY AND WE REALLY STRUGGLED WITH IT BECAUSE IT WASN'T ALWAYS CLEAR WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTING AS A LABOR WORKER IN CALLING THEM BASICALLY REFERRAL AGENCY AND WE THOUGHT IF WE CRAP UNTIL OF DIFFERENT ASK ITSELF LAST YEAR WE ARE TRYING TO. PAYS EIGHTY WORKERS GEN WHAT YES. EVERYBODY FOR ALL AGES ANDERSON CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU'RE A REFERRAL SO AND X. THAT SO THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAD ABOUT A THIRD OF INTERPRETERS AS- THE IT. IN THE WORK IS TRUE. A TO SAY YES NO TO A- THAT THEY'RE WORKING UNDER THEIR OWN CONDITIONS ARE WORKING AS THEMSELVES- AND REALLY THAT THE REFERRAL AGENCY OR THE COMPANY IF YOU WILL IS JUST DOING THE PROCEDURAL STUFF YOU KNOW CALLING THEM UP DO YOU WANT THIS JOB OKAY. WE'RE PROCESSING THE PAYMENT WE DON'T CHARGE. MANY CLIENTS FOR THAT SERVICE SO THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY FLOWS AND- THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CAN SAY YES THEY CAN SAY NO THEY GO OUT ON THEIR OWN THEY DO IT. IT REQUIRES THAT INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE A BUSINESS LICENSE- THAT WAS A WHILE BEFORE I MEAN THIS IS NOTHING NEW. AS I DO THE ANALYSIS WAS WAS RIGHT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE WE MADE IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE OPTIONAL WHETHER THERE AND CHECK IT OR NOT AND- WE WILL FIGURE THAT PIECE- CHOIRS THAT. IT'S A CERTIFICATE CAN NECESSARY TO DO THAT JOB OR BE ABLE TO DO THAT JOB THAT THEY HAVE TO. SO YOU CAMPUS AN INTERPRETER WHO IS NOT SIR IN SPANISH BECAUSE WE HAS BEEN A CERTIFICATION FOR INTERPRETERS. HOWEVER IF IT'S AN INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE- YOU KNOW FROM CARRILLO THAT THERE'S NO CERTIFICATION AVAILABLE. THERE THERE'S NO CERTIFICATION NEEDED SO THAT'S THE WAY WE DEALT WITH IT. THE NOW SUGGESTED. I THINK WE FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT WE'VE BEEN REALLY STRUGGLING WITH. INSURING INDIVIDUALS WERE NEGOTIATING FOR THEMSELVES ARE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE THIRD. QUALITY THEY HAVE THE THAT THEY HAVE A SKILL THAT IS DESIRABLE AND SO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO- BETTER. SERVE THEMSELVES SO THIS NEW REFERRAL LANGUAGE. GIVES POWER TO BE THOSE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WERE WORKING UNDER IT AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT APRIL AGENCY FROM JUST BEING A LABOR BROKER. AND TAKING 50% OF SOMEBODY'S WAGES AND THE THINGS THAT WE'VE KIND OF SEEN HISTORICALLY UNFORTUNATELY IN A LOT OF LOW WAGE WORKERS. IT ALSO DOESN'T ALLOW- CERTAIN CRITTERS TO FALL UNDER THIS AND THOSE WERE THE ONES THAT ARE DETAINED- HELLO SHE HAD THE DESIGNATION AS HIGH HAZARD INDUSTRIES. BORN IN HAS DIFFICULT HIGHER RISK OF INJURY ON THE JOB. AND THE REASON WE DON'T WANT THAT IS WE DON'T. WANT INDEPENDENT. I READ. I'M WITHOUT THAT WORKS AND WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE USED AS A TOOL AVOID WORK COMP AND FOR SECONDS AND YOU KNOW IT HIGH RISK. SO THAT. I THINK WILL SATISFY- LEGITIMATE. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THESE FIELDS. AT THAT HAVE WANT TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY CAN WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND I'M HAVE THE CERTIFICATIONS TO DO SO WE ALSO HAVE- SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE. CAPTURED ACTIONS WE HAVE A- RECORDING ARTISTS MUSICIANS WE HAVE GREATER CLARITY FOR A AND PHOTOGRAPHERS MULTIMEDIA PROFESSIONALS IN SOME EXEMPTIONS THAT- WE STARTED WORKING OUT RIGHT AFTER AB FIVE WAS PASSED. WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO- AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO THE NEXT SET WHICH WE WILL WORK WITH IF THIS PASSES YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL AS IT MOVES INTO APPROPRIATIONS. I MISSED ONE THAT WE AT WE HAVE ALSO- JUDGES INDEPENDENT JUDGES AND NOT JUDGE. JUDGE AND JURY JUDGE LIKE GETTING A CATTLE SHOW OR A DANCE COMPETITION THAT THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYEES AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET IN. M. M. TO REFEREE HE'S AT THAT THEY CAN WORK OBVIOUSLY TO REFER AGENCY AND THEN THERE ARE WAYS- BUT THE THINGS THAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON. PERFORMING ARTISTS TO PRESENT THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK. SO THIS IS A BECOME AN ISSUE WHERE A PERFORMING ARTIST OWN THEIR OWN ORIGINAL WORK AND SO THEY'RE NOT. AND I'LL TAKE THE EXAMPLE COMEDIAN A COMEDIAN AT A COMEDY CLUB. IT IS THEY'RE DIRECTING THEMSELVES THEY'VE CREATED IT THE ONCE. THEY DON'T WORK FOR SOMEBODY BECAUSE OF. THIRDS OF PROPERTY ISSUE THEN FOR THE WORK THAT WE'RE WORKING IN THAT. THAT SHOULD ALSO WORK FOR. CLOWN JUDGE IS IT NOT THE CHAIRED CARES DEEPLY SOME F THESE WHAT I KNOW THAT THERE IS US INTO PERFORMANCES THAT THAT. THAT IT VIGILS HAFTED THEY'RE NOT TAKING DIRECTION FROM ANYONE THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS SOMEBODY WHO'S OBVIOUSLY ACTING IN A PLAY OR SOMETHING WHETHER BEING DIRECTED. PRECISELY WHAT TO DO. THE RELATIONSHIP- WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUAL SUBCONTRACTORS SO THIS IS INTERESTING AND TOUGH BUT IF THEY'RE TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO ARE WORKING TOGETHER. IN ONE JOB WHICH YOU GET THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN HAVE ONE CHECK IN SPLIT BASICALLY THROUGH THE CONTRACT THIS HAPPENS- THE WEDDING INDUSTRY A LOT YOU KNOW. THERE CAN A PART SHE CAN WORK IT DOESN'T IF HE'S AN ENEMY. AND THE OLDER HEY I ALSO WANT SEVEN MAYES AND SHE'S A. NOT GONNA BRING. IT IS VERY LIMITED. STEPS WHERE THEY COULD JUST SPLIT A CHECK AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT EVERYBODY'S GETTING MOVING AND SO TO INDEPENDENT. CONTRACTORS WE'RE CONTINUING AMEND LANGUAGE ON VIDEOGRAPHERS TO CLARIFY THAT IT DOESN'T PREVENT PEOPLE FROM. THEIR KIDS DANCE COMPETITION PUTTING IT UP ON ON A- THE INTERNET. AYE AYE THE WAY PEOPLE ARE READING THING SOMETIMES WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND NO THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THERE'S ONE MORE AT LEAST- THOSE SHOULD HOPEFULLY BE COMPLETE BY THE TIME WE GET OUT OF HERE AND APPROPRIATIONS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE- THAT COULD PETITION- THE LAST ONE WAS ALSO AN INDUSTRY IF YOU ARE AWARE PLAN IN YOUR SET UP. VENDOR RECEIVE BEGIN FROM THE- THAT IS MAKE YOU THOSE VENDOR EMPLOY YOU ARE SOME A CONTRACT SO WE'RE GONNA CLEAR FOR THAT IS AND THAT THAT'S I THINK WHAT WE'RE LEFT TO WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL. MAYBE TWENTY. THIRTY PRISTINE OF A BROADER. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID DOING IS WRITING EXEMPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T NEED IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A CASE BY CASE BASIS A LOT. OTHER SITUATIONS THAT. RUN ACROSS. AND THAT'S THE TAP OR TAKING WITH THESE. NOW THIRD COUPLE WE HAVE TO WRITE OUT STRAIGHT OUT JUST TO CLARIFY BUT WE'RE HOPING NOT TO DO ANYMORE. SO WITH THAT HI. FULL WE HAVE SATISFIED A LOT OF FOLKS THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT PRINT WAS ANALYZED- THE ANALYSIS. ARE AMENDED LANGUAGE BUT IT WILL I THINK BE IN PRINT TOMORROW. AND I THINK THERE'S A MORE CALM. I'M GOING RELATED TO OF THE ISSUES IN YOUR EXCEPT IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE IN THE- ANALYSIS TODAY IS THAT CORRECT. THE REQUIREMENT THAT THAT WE'VE THAT ARE OUTLINED I THINK THERE ARE SOME. IN THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE. THERE SOMEWHERE STILL WORKING ON THERE ARE SOME THAT WERE SUGGESTED. I DON'T EXACTLY. KNOW MINIMUM I THINK BUT THE AGREEMENT THEN YEAH. BERMAN AND C. L. A.

THIS THIS DYNAMIC DECISION AND THE ABC CRITERIA OCCURRED BECAUSE OF ABUSES THAT THE STARTED WITH EMPLOYERS REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE AND- BUT THERE ARE SOME INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO HAVE LEGITIMATELY IN TWENTY BEEN DEPENDENT AND I KNOW THAT WE HAD TO. CONVERSE WHAT BEER ARE I APPRECIATE. THE OPENNESS WITH TO HAVE RESPONDED TO. LEGITIMATE CONCERNS IN MANY CASES- I SUSPECT THIS ISN'T THE END OF THE ISSUE- FIVE. I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT BUT I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR. DOING YOUR BEST I KNOW THIS IS BEEN VERY EMOTIONAL AND VOLATILE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO. OF FEEL AND PERHAPS THAT THERE. THE FUTURE OF IN OR RISK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE HAD A MORE NATIONAL POLICY SO THAT WE DID HAVE WE FIFTY DIFFERENT STATES HAVING DIFFERENT THE FIFTY DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS AND- PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE- TO. IF WE HAVE A- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS COMMITTED. TO FAIRNESS WITH EMPLOYEES THAT THAT THIS MIGHT OCCUR BUT IN THE INTERIM CALIFORNIA. IS THAT THING I THINK. PROTECT WORKERS WHICH THE ULTIMATE GOAL HERE AND YET THERE ARE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY NUANCES HERE AND I KNOW WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO- EXPRESS CONSTRUCTION THAT THEY AREN'T INCLUDED OR THAT THEY SHOULD BE INCLUDED THEN I KNOW THAT YOU WILL. CAN YOU TO. WORK WITH IT WITH AN OPEN MIND- BUT ALWAYS WITH THE NOTION THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT WORKING PEOPLE SO THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT EFFORT. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. AND THEN THE SENATOR MORALE HAZARD BEEN AS WELL THANK THANK YOU AND I TO WANT TO IT THANK YOU SUMMER GONZALEZ FOR DOING THIS BILL- I WOULD. POINT OUT THAT OF COURSE- THE START WITH THE DYNAMICS DECISION BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT AND IN FACT IN MANY WAYS EIGHTY FIVES IS THIRD DESCRIBES SOME. EXCEPTIONS SO SOME PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL EIGHTY FIVE IS WHAT BECAUSE EVERYTHING ACTUALLY DYNAVAX THERE WASN'T P. FIVE THAT AND- EVERYONE WITH STILL FACE BASICALLY ALL THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FIVE WITH STILL HAVE SAME SITUATION. I'M AND OF COURSE THIS IS A FURTHER- BUT. MORE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE HISTORICALLY BUT THE OTHER PART I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT AND CERTAINLY HERE YOU KNOW AS WE'RE EXPERIENCING KOVIN. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS EMPLOYEE PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS THAT WE OF PUT INTO CALIFORNIA LAW AND SOME YOU KNOW AT THIS ALSO FEDERAL IN THE FEDERAL LAW AS WELL AND HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE. SO WELL CERTAINLY-APPRECIATE THAT MANY PEOPLE- YOU KNOW IT IS. A WANT FLEXIBILITY IN OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND PERHAPS MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THAT OUR OWN EMPLOYMENT LAW. STILL BEING SURE AT. STILL BETTER PEOPLE TO EMPLOYED. F. POSSIBLE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE SUPREME COURT SAID AND- THAT IS I THINK WHERE WERE WE WANT TO TRY TO GO WE JUST HAD ANOTHER BILL WE TALKED WITH YOU A AN APPOINTMENT TO GET THE SIX WHO WERE LET. BECAUSE OF COVERAGE ALSO THINGS HAPPEN PEOPLE GET WELL THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE START WITH. A SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING FRAME FOR WE HAVE TO REMEMBER AS TO WHY. IS STILL YOU KNOW THE BAY AND WE ACTUALLY. WE'VE WE'VE CHOSEN AS THIS CALL AND UNLESS PERHAPS SOME OF THE CUT WHO WHO ACTUALLY PROVIDING MORE AND IF. DIRECTLY TO POPULATION TO GOVERNMENT INSTEAD OF EMPLOYER. WE HAVE CHOSEN TO IT THROUGH SO MAKES IT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. I UNDERSTAND CERTAINLY HEARD FROM VERY PEOPLE. ONE AMEND IT'S AN EXCEPTION BUT WHY DO. WITH THIS PETITE BILL THAT YOU SYSTEM. ARKANSAS IS THAT INSTEAD OF TAKE OFF BY FOR WERE TO CREATE MORE SO. RULES RIGHT SO WE THE BUSINESS THE EFFORT XIN. SO THE THAT DAYS. THAT THE REFERRAL AGENTS AND I AM I HOPE THAT AS PEOPLE ARE THINKING. YOU KNOW THEY PROFESSION THEIR ROLE. TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY MAY ACTUALLY FOR INTO THAT. IN OF TRYING TO SAY WHY WANT JUST CARVED. FOR MY PARTICULAR PROFESSION ACTUALLY FOR EXAMPLE THIS DOES DEAL INTERPRETER. AND BUT YOU HAVE TO BE A- INTERPRETER UNLESS THERE'S A SORT OF THE- SO. I GUESS THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO. RIDE. ARE PROVIDING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S THAT THAT DOES HAVE A CERTAIN MAY NOT PERHAPS TO PURSUE CERTIFICATES ARE FEW THAT THE NINE BARRIER. WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S A FAIR OF THE BILL THAT WE DO TRY TO THAT AND I BELIEVE SIGN WE- A SORT OF. AND SO IT'S NOT THAT DOES WITH THE ISSUES INTO MAKING. I AM SO UNDERSTAND IF THERE SOME YOU KNOW SOME FURTHER CONCERN BUT I REALLY DO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THIS FRAMEWORK I KNOW THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS. NIGHT BRING PORT.

THAT'S WHY WE IN THE CAT TO CALL OUT EVERY SINGLE SESSION BUT SAID THIS IS HOW YOU CAN SHE REMAINING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OR SMALL BUSINESS AND WORK IN THIS FASHION IF THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO WORK FOR. THE ARMY. THERE'S GOING TO BE. RUNNING A- LIST OF. PLAYER AND THOSE ARE GOING TO EXIST I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THIS IS IN ONE OF THE THINGS WE DONE OVER THE LAST YEAR BEFORE COBIT ESPECIALLY MIDDLE OF TO THE EIGHTY REALLY DOES IS ONE COME TO TOP OUT IN THE- WOULD ASK EDT HOW MANY. A DEAD IN THE FIELD WHAT THE FOUNDER. AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP. IN THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN THE- IN THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR THIS BILL THREE EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO STILL OUT OF. THE GATE. THEY FOUND. TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN IS CLASSIFIED WORKERS. IT'S HAPPENING WAS UNDER BRIGHT IS. AB FIVE. SO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A ISSUE AND WE NEED TO GET THAT A LOT OF THE EXEMPTION PEOPLE ARE. FOR WERE NOW LEGAL UNDER BROWN YOU CAN. SO I TO NAME A COUPLE THE BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE SHOCKED. I'M NOT I HEARD CATER. WELL THEY CATER CAN HAVE A KEY COMPANY. BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE WORKING FOR YOU AND I CAN'T. TO BARTENDERS ARE STEPS. I ARE YOU PERCENT RELEVANT UNDER YOUR PUT YOUR DO AT. YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO DO IT YOU BABY IN ANY CERTAIN WOULD BE IN A SO THIS WASN'T LEGAL BEEF AN EXAM THEM WOULD PUT THEM RIGHT BACK UNDER BROWN WITH JUST ME THAT THESE WERE HAD A LONG PROCESSED IN ORDER TO GET THE RIGHTS. WE HEARD A- TRYING TO GO. WHAT CENTER MORALE OF THE- ISSUES HE BROUGHT SAID HE. HELLO THERE PASSED. IN OTHER STUDIES OUT THERE BY SOME ECONOMIC THINK TANKS THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE FORECASTING THAT THIS WILL AFFECT ONE MILLION JOB SO THERE IS A- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE WE'RE KIND IN A- KERRY'S POSITION HERE WITH CALL THAT. THE ECONOMY AND SO THOSE KINDA A LONG TERM THE FACT THAT I. OUT ON GONNA BE YOU JUST NAY BE ANOTHER MILLION WERE FOR MAYBE IT'S ONLY FIVE HUNDRED THAT STILL OF PEOPLE IT'S IT IS A BIG BIG IT TWO THEIR LIFE SO. I JUST YOU KNOW WE HAVE THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS WE WANT CAP. BUT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE DOING ALL THINGS LESS COMPETITIVE YEAH WERE. COULDN'T BLOCKS BLOCKS A LOT OF. WAYS SO ANYWAY THOSE ARE JUST MY CONCERN IN THOSE BY THE WAY ON A OF PEOPLE THAT COME TO ME AND TALK TO ME AND THEIR THEIR- ABOUT YOU KNOW THEIR LIVES SO. YOU ANSWERED MIKE BUT THEY ARE THAT WAS JUST THE GENERAL TO I WAS. ASK AND FOR EVERY QUESTION SOMEONE ASKS THERE FOR OTHER QUESTIONS THAT COME UP. IN THAT LEAD YOU TO SOMETHING ELSE SO I APPRECIATE AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM. MIKE IN FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE- CERTAINLY THE PROFESSIONS THAT TODAY THIS THE ISSUE OF THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS WHICH IS AFTER PAN MENTIONED BY BROADENING THAT ORTIZ CLARIFYING IN MEMORY ON THAT. AND THE REFERRAL AGENCY THE LEGITIMACY THAT CAN BE A OUTLINED THROUGH THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY AN ANSWER TO THE CERTIFICATION FOR INTERPRETERS. A MAJOR MAJOR BENEFIT FOR A LOT OF US UP AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THE- PERFORMING ARTS IN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT RELATED THERE AND CERTAINLY WITH COVERT RIGHT NOW IT'S A- HUGE. THAT COMMUTE IS LOOKED AT IN THE END WE CAN FIND A PATH FOR THEM THAT THEY ONE GREW AREA THAT I. BECOME A SMALL GROUP. WHO ARE REAL YEAH KIND OF A HUGE YOU CAN DISAPPEAR NOW SO I'M HOPING THAT WE GET THAT. INTEREST THIRD. I GOT HOT THE FIGHTING WITH URGE COMPANIES FIGHTING WITH THE- AYE THEY NEED SOME STE. STATUTE GUIDE THERE SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN WORK WITH THEM AND IN SOME WAY IS WHAT IS THE BILL. MOVES IN WE CAN SEE HOW IT WORKS AT BUT I. DO SUPPORT THE BILL IT TODAY IS- THE INSPIRATION THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE THAT YOU'VE DONE HAVE BEEN IT'S BEEN JUST THE- MUCH APPRECIATED AND THERE'S NO ONE THAT UNDERSTANDS THIS ISSUE. BETTER THAN YOU AND ALL THE PRECIADO VERY MUCH IN HERE SO- WHICH I WE DO HAVE A- A GOOD APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY. I JUST. NOT IT. SOME ON THAT ONE WILL THAT THAT SENATOR MARIA USED THERE ARE ONE MILLION INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S TRUE AND SO I GUESS YOU COULD SUGGEST THIS MAY AFFECT UP TO ONE MILLION PEOPLE THAT IT'S NOT TRUE. YOU CANNOT BUY FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE PLENTY OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO FALL UNDER THE ABC TEST WHO DON'T YOU KNOW THEY THEY PROVIDE THEIR SERVICES. IN A GIVEN EXAMPLE IN FACT BECAUSE I THINK AT SOME POINT THERE'S SO MUCH MISINFORMATION OUT THERE RIGHT NOW SO RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE ASKING A LOT ABOUT TUTORS. CAN I GET A TUTOR YEAH YOU CAN. AS AN INDIVIDUAL. YOU CAN HIRE SOMEBODY TO COME IN YOUR HOUSE IN AN I AM. TO STAY IN YOUR HOUSE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE CREATING A HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYEE BUT YOU CAN HIRE SOMEBODY TO COME IN AND SAY OKAY WHAT DAYS ARE YOU AVAILABLE THIRDS. SOME HELP OUT. YOU CAN BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR YOU PAY THEM DIRECTLY YOU KNOW EAT. THAT'S COMPLETELY LEGAL THEY NEVER FALL UNDER- THE ABC TESTS THEY ARE THEY FALL UNDER THE A. B. C. TESTER THEY'RE IN CONTROL OF THEIR OWN. SERVICES THEY'RE SERVING IN THE- THREE INDEPENDENT BUSINESS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TURN HIS USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. SO WHEN PEOPLE START YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THAT'S ALLOWED NOW. I GOT NERVOUS WHEN I SAID THAT BECAUSE THEY SIT IN YOUR HOUSE AND THERE ARE RULES TAX RULES THAT PREDATE AB FIVE ABOUT. WORKERS IN YOUR HOUSE BUT IN THAT SITUATION TWITTER CAN'T IF YOU BROUGHT IN A FULL TIME CHILDCARE PROVIDER THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT SITUATION OBVIOUSLY. I WANT PEOPLE TO READ. MANY OF THESE RULES EXISTED BEFORE THOSE OF THOSE RULES DON'T EXIST BUT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO NEVER THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR. IN MILLION A WORK. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S ALL ACTIONS WE MADE ALREADY. THE FIRST ARE ARE REALLY BE AFFECTED. AND THEN FINALLY YES. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED I WILL NAME SOME OF THEM TO DATE. THERE ARE TODAY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER FILED ON BEHALF OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UBER AND LIFT DRIVERS WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED ENOUGH MINIMUM WAGE THE- THEN ALAMEDA. BECAUSE FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM HAD FILED WAIT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE YEAH OTHER BEING. DEAD BUT THAT'S A- GOOD A FACT YOU KNOW I THINK. MADE WHOLE FROM THAT THE APRS OF LOST INCOME. THAT'S POSITIVE AFFECT WE KNOW THAT THIS DOES CHANGE THE FIRST. OF LIFE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IMPORTANT NO. TRULY THE MINUTE. THE. TRACTOR WHERE IS MISCLASSIFIED NOT MAJORITY WE'RE NOT WAS CUT BUT THE SERVICE WORKERS THAT WERE INDEPENDENT YESTERDAY ARE CHANGING BECAUSE NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LENGTHY COURT CASE TO FIND OUT THAT THEY WERE MISCLASSIFIED IN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER CAN DO HER JOB WHICH HE'S DOING TODAY SO I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT I ALSO. IF THEY CAN GET A ON. WHAT WE HEARD FROM COMPANIES AGAIN. THERE IS NO WAY I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT YOU COULD HAVE A GROUP OF MUSICIANS COMING TO PERFORM CERTAIN TIME DOING WHAT A CONDUCTOR IS TELLING THEM TO PERFORM TOGETHER YOU KNOW DRESSED A CERTAIN WAY DOING THINGS A CERTAIN FORM THAT WHATEVER PASCARELLA. SO IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT WE EXAMPLE OUT SYMPHONIES ALIVE OPERAS THEY'VE THEY'VE TRADITIONALLY IN FACT BEEN EMPLOYEES OF. I'M GOING TO POINT THAT OUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE WERE FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MISCLASSIFIED MUSIC SB FOUR EIGHTY FIVE THAT'S THAT'S THE DATA EDT THERE ARE MUSICIANS WERE NOT IN ABOUT BEYOND PLATE. AT. RESTAURANT ON A SATURDAY BUT THERE. WERE GOAL TO WHAT IS AGE. AND HOW BEEN MISCLASSIFIED. SO I FEEL LIKE WE DON'T HOMEWORK THIS WEEK WE DEFINITELY TRIED TO LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE WE'VE CREATED A FRAMEWORK HOPEFULLY THAT WILL FIT FOR MOST PEOPLE. BUT LABOR LAWS EXIST AND THEY'VE EXISTED FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE BRINGING UP. BABY NEVER LEGAL PEOPLE. REALIZE THAT IT AND WE NEED TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS THAT. FOR A LONG. WELL GET. YOU KNOW I THINK OF THE NUMBER MAYBE TO CHANGE A BIT MODEL THEY MIGHT BE RELIEVED OF THAT THEY DIDN'T END UP WITH ALL THOSE FINES AND FEES AND GET SUED AT ONE POINT NOW THAT. BY THE BENEFITS TO WORKERS THAT THEY DESERVE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MARIE ME WITH THAT AND PLEASE THE PEOPLE OF QUESTIONS TILL I JUST HEARD HIM CALL OUR OFFICES ON THIS THE TUTOR THING REALLY GOING BECAUSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO- PROVIDE LESSONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN YOU CAN YOU CAN OTHER PARENTS CAN DIRECTLY. YOU KNOW. FOR SOMEBODY DO LESSONS IN THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEIR EMPLOYER YOU KNOW SO THAT'S I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT DOWN THAT ROAD AND PEOPLE STARTED MAKING THAT DECISION SO- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER NINE.

WITH THE TIME OF TASK DEMERITS COME THROUGH ITS PRETTY AUTOMATED AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT THEY GET FIRED- FROM THEIR JOB. ALL WE'RE ASKING IN THIS BILL IS THAT IT THAT THE TIME OFF TASK CANNOT INCLUDE TIME. THAT INDIVIDUAL GOES TO USE THE BATHROOM THAT THEY CAN'T INCLUDE TIME THAT INDIVIDUAL GOES TO WASH THEIR HANDS OR DOCUMENT AN ONSITE LABOR- VIOLATION. IN ONE HALF AND WE KNOW FROM LAWSUITS AND WHAT- SITUATION. THEIR HOUSE IN RIVER. EMPLOYEES MINUTES TO THE REST. SO IF A USER RESTROOM THEY THEY'VE GOT TO ADD FOURTEEN MINUTES OF TIME OFF TASK.

EIGHT AND IS THAT A LOT THAT ONE ONCE. ACTUAL LOOK AT OUR FIGUREHEAD OKAY SO YOU CAN SEE NOW TO TERMS OF THE BREAD THAT WE PUT INTO LAW. ONE TO ADDED OR. DIETS RICH. SAME GOAL SO. UP PERHAPS YOU TRUST. OKAY IT ACTION AT OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE RETALIATES LAWS WITH IT AND ACTION TAKES MANY FOR AND EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO THE LEFT COMMISSION IF ADVERSE ACTION HAS HAS TO I'M- I IT NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT ASPECT BECAUSE ITSELF ENFORCED BY. WELL I MEAN I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN BILLS ON THIS WE HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF ABUSE USE AND ABUSE OF HISTORY IT IS QUICK I MEAN I CAN EVEN. THERE THERE ARE SOME. THAT HAS. IT ON. YOUNG STRONG OF A- THE EMPLOYEES THAT I CAN THINK IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE SOME FARMWORKERS TO DO FAR BETTER UNDER P. THREE THEN THEY COULD UNDER NAP EARLY RATE BUT IT'S ALL HOW. ABUSED THREE KEYS ACT PASSED OF A BOX THE SAME YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE PACKING SOMETHING THAT THAT WEIGHS LESS THAN A POUND OR YOU COULD BE PACKING SOMETHING THAT HE'S- FIVE. AND SO. I DON'T THINK THAT THE JOB REALLY LINES UP TO A PIECE RATE KIND OF SITUATION- AND ALL THE REPORTS WERE INDICATING THAT THEY'RE USING QUOTA SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT THESE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TELLING WAREHOUSES HAVE. NOT T. QUOTA SYSTEM. INTENTIONALLY COOL AND CRUDE BUT IF THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT AT LEAST MAKE EXCEPTIONS FOR BASIC HUMAN BEHAVIOR THAT THAT GOES FOR THAT'S WHAT WE THINK IN THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO USE THE STOCK MARKET OF FIND SOME OTHER WAY OF EVALUATING IF AN EMPLOYEE IS A IS DOING THEIR JOB SO I GUESS JUST. IN THE CAR YOU SOURCE IN. THE OPPOSITION SAYING THAT. WHAT'S THE PAST US BEING SURE AND LEICESTER'S ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT THIS IS EFFECTIVELY BANNING ANY SORT OF QUOTA SYSTEMHERE WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT. SO YES EMPLOYEE CAN PLAY COMPLAINT. WELL WHAT HOW DOES THE EMPLOYER ENSURE THAT. THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE I THINK THIS THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND EVEN AND ANALYSIS HOW CAN USE EMPLOYER WHO WANTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE. ASSURE THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLY GIVEN SOME OF THE VARIABLES THAT- ARE OF THAT HAVE TO BE SORTED OUT SO IF THEY DO A TIME MOTION STUDY IN IT SEVEN MINUTES TODAY I MEAN IT IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SO THAT WHEN. I WAS A IN STATE IT ALL THE STUFF AND WE FOLLOWING THE LAW I THINK THE QUESTION THAT THE- OBVIOUS. KILEY I MEAN THESE THESE WHERE. ARE HIGHLY DIGITIZED RIGHT THERE IS A REASON THEY KNOW WHAT WINNER. TASK IF YOU TIME OFF TASK. THEY THEY CAN THEY CAN ACTUALLY DIGITIZE TAKING I CAN CLOCK OUT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO THE RESTROOM AND CLOCK BACK AGAIN IN THAT. COUNT IT'S ME I MEAN I.

I DON'T GET TO CREATE ON WHITE WHITE PEOPLE OF BUT YOU KNOW WOMEN IN PARTICULAR I IN WE DID HAVE SOME CASES WILL. I YOU KNOW IT. THERE THEY NEED TO GO TO THE BACK. NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO WEAR YOU KNOW A DIAPER WORRY ABOUT LEADING THROUGH DURING THAT TIME OF MONTH AND THEY- KNOW THE RIGHT. THEY MIGHT NEED A FEW EXTRA MINUTES AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S LEADING TO. SOMEBODY THAT THEY CAN TAKE THAT TIME. BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO TALK TO THEIR EMPLOYEES IF SOMEBODY IS USING THAT TIME BEFORE THEY THEY GIVE AN ADVERSE ACTION AND THAT. THE YOU JUST. THANK YOU.

APPROACH TO THEIR WORK FORCE AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE- THEY'VE COME UP WITH THIS AMAZING DIGITIZED WAY TO FIGURE OUT HOW QUICKLY SOMEBODY IS WORKING HOW MUCH WORK THEY ARE DOING SOME KIND OF WORKING CAN.

GIVES US AN HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GLAD STILL AFTERNOON THESE DAYS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE SIX TO STREAMLINE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR ATVS WORK SHARE PROGRAM TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS. PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM ALLOWING THEM TO RETURN RETAIN TRAIN STUFF AND AVOID LAYOFFS THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT DURING COVERT NINETEEN WERE OPENING AND CLOSING BUSINESSES WORK SHARING IS A FORM OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT GIVES EMPLOYERS THE OPTION OF REUCING EMPLOYEES HOURS INSTEAD OF CUTTING THEIR WORK FOR STRING ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN. FOR EXAMPLE MAY THE BUSINESS MAY DETERMINE IT NEEDS TO REDUCE PERSONNEL COSTS BY LAYING OFF FIVE EMPLOYEES UNTIL BUSINESS IMPROVES UNDER WORK SHARING THE EMPLOYER CAN INSTEAD REDUCE THE HOURS OF TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES BY 20% AND THOSE WORKERS WOULD RECEIVE PRORATED YOU AYE PAYMENTS. FOR THEIR ONE DAY PER WEEK OF UNEMPLOYMENT OR MAINTAINING EXISTING HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS. ABOUT OPTING FOR WHAT SHARING THE EMPLOYERS A TO ALL. DURING A DOWNTURN. PLEASE IS BETTER POSITIONED TO BACK UP WITH ECONOMIC IMPROVE. HOWEVER DESPITE THE MANY BENEFITS OF WORK SHARING A PROVIDES FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. THE STATE'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY UNDER UTILIZED BECAUSE IT CAN BE ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME FOR EMPLOYERS AND SOME EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS MAY NOT EVEN OF THE PROGRAM. I SPECIFICALLY AB SEVENTY ONE WOULD CREATE A TEMPORARY ALTERNATIVE PROCESS FOR THE SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF EMPLOYER WORK FAIR. PLAN APPLICATIONS IT REQUIRES EIGHTY TEACHER TEAM ALL WORK SHARING APPLICATIONS APPROVED UPON RECEIPT. FOR APPLICATION SUBMITTED BY ELIGIBLE EMPLOYERS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY AND SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT REQUIRES EIGHTY TWO FORWARD ELETTRONICA TO THE EMPLOYER CLAIM PACKET FOR EACH PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES. WITHIN FIVE BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING THE APPROVAL APPLICATION. AND I'M IN THE PROCESS OF REFINING THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT HAVE REACHED AN AVERAGE OF THE DEPARTMENT. AN AGENCY FOR TECHNICAL. WHEN THEY WORK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT WERE USING. BENEFITS THAT WERE THE CARE ACT THE EXPAND OUR THAT EXPAND WORK SURE YOU LIVE BENEFITS UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL HAS AN EMERGENCY CLAUSE. I'LL BE SURE TO KEEP THE COMMITTEE. MEMBERS AND CONSULTANTS DEPRIVES OF ANY CHANGES IN THE BILL AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS ALL RIGHT THAT I WROTE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL THAT REALLY HELPS EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT KARMIC CALIFORNIA. I HAVE A WITNESS ECONOMICS AT UCLA'S. CALIFORNIA TWO ONE. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL HIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE EMPLOYMENT TRANSITION OF THE WORKERS AND THE IMPACT OF JOB LOSS. SO MODERN THE CHAIR. THE CALL WENT ABSOLUTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. PROFESSOR IS. GEORGE. YOU LOOK. THANK YOU EXCEPT TO HERE THANK WORKS UP WITH PENDING CREAM OUTREACH EMPLOYER AT THIS BILL SEEKS DO I'M CLEAR ABOUT FOR EMPLOYERAND CALIFORNIA WHOLE. MARCHER INCREASINGLY OF WORKERS THAT ARE AND THEREBY REDUCES THE COST OF LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT. FORECHECKING MORE SHARING ALSO HELPS TO MAINTAIN ATTACHMENT BETWEEN WORKERS AND FIRMS. THIS PREVENTS WORKERS FROM LOSING ACCESS TO BETTER JOBS WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE A KEY FACTOR IN THE COST OF UNEMPLOYMENT. GLOBAL WORK SHARING. PORTLAND A LUXURY KEEP RECEIVING HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS AND DISPERSE AND MUCH BETTER POSITION THAN TEMPORARY LAYOFFS FOR FARMS. WHAT SHARING MEANS MAINTAINING ATTACHMENT TO VALUABLE EMPLOYEES SAVING COSTS OF HIRING THE RIGHT WORKERS. WORK SHARING ALSO ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO FLEXIBLY MODIFY OUR- ECONOMY RESPONSE TO COMPETE NINETEEN AN INTERSECTION WORKSHOP WE CAN ALSO BE USED TO REHIRE LAID OFF WORKERS PART TIME. PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED FLEXIBILITY. I'M BY KEEPING WORKERS PLACE WORK SHARING ALLOWS THE- ECONOMY TO BETTER ADJUST TO REPEATED SHUTDOWNS AND TO RESTART FAST ONE DAY AND THAT MAKE. IT AND BY LIMITING ONGOING LAYOFFS WERE TRYING ALSO ALLOWS FOR FAST RECOVERY BY REDUCING CROWDING IN THE LABOR MARKET. HOWEVER OUR THERE ARE SOME WELL KNOWN BEARS THE BIG FASHIONABLE ARCHER APPLICATION PROCESS PERCEIVED TO BE CUMBERSOME LENGTHY. CURRENTLY WIDE INITIAL APPLICATION HAVE BEEN AUTOMATED EMPLOYEES AND FIRMS HAVE BEEN MAILING PAPER FORMS TO RECEIVE BENEFITS. AND MOREOVER IT THE PROGRAM IS NOT WELL KNOWN AMONG EMPLOYERS. YOU GO NEWS THERE PAST RESEARCH HAS THAT THESE PROBLEMS BE FIXED AND LYFT UP THE PROCESSING OF WORK SHOWING IN THE INCREASING OUTRAGE. AT THE GRAVITY WHAT THE BILL DOES. IN ONE OF THE WORST YEARS OF THE GRAY RECESSION. 6% OF ALL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE FROM WORK. IT CONTRACTED TO BEGINNING UP TO DATE CRISIS IN MID MARCH LESS THAN 1% OF ALL YOU LIKE NAMES WERE FROM WORK SHARON IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER STATES HAVE DONE UCH BETTER. FOR EXAMPLE IN MICHIGAN SEVEN POINT 4% OF INITIAL PLANS DURING THE CRISIS. WELCOME WORKSHOPS I THINK CALIFORNIA COULD ALSO DO BETTER BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE SAME. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. MORE WORK SHARING IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS WIDE SUPPORT. AMONG DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE. THERE'S A PARTICULAR ADVANTAGE FROM ACTING OUT MACINNES. BECAUSE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY SHARING AREN'T PAID FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO BY REFUSING TO DEATH BUT THE WHITE TRUCK FUND EXPANDING THE WORK SHARING PROGRAM TWENTY TWENTY IS LIKELY TO LOWER FUTURE PAYROLL TAX INCREASES. THAT USING THE WIRING CHRISTIAN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB HERE AT UCLA TO COME UP PARKS IN THE CALCULATIONS THAT SUGGEST THAT THE COULD GREAT PARTICIPATION WORK SHARING QUICKLY IT COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. SAVINGS TO TAXPAYERS DOWN THE LINE. ANOTHER MAN OF FUND. SO CALLED CHARGING EMPLOYERS NEED A MAINLY CASH STRAPPED LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYERS. CAN USE WORK SHARING TO REDUCE THEIR BALL AND LAYOFFS. WITHOUT BIRTH DATE LATER ON BUT ONLY UNTIL DECEMBER. OVERALL EXPEDITING WORK SHARING APPLICATIONS AND INCREASING OUTREACH TO EMPLOYERS AND VISIBILITY COULD DO IS GOOD FOR WORKERS IT'S GOOD FOR FARMS A GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TESTIMONY PROFESSOR.

WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR OFFICE FROM BOTH THE FARM WORKER COMMUNITY- THE AGRICULTURAL THREE TO IMPROVE THE BILL OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. I KNOW. THROUGH ASSISTANCE AND EFFORTS- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE ALL OPPOSITION. ON OUR LEGISLATION. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL TWO ZERO FOUR THREE WHICH PROTECTS THE OCCUPATIONAL. AND HEALTH OF OUR STATE. AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. AMID THE CALL THE NINETEEN HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE FACE. HI INCLUDING THE NEARLY HUNDRED THOUSAND FARMERS IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT. EVERY DAY FARMWORKERS ACROSS OUR STATE RISE EARLY. THEY LEAVE THEIR FAMILIES. TO TRAVEL TO WORK IN CAR POOLS AND IN CROWDED BUSES. THEY WORK LONG DAYS SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN THE FIELDS AND PACKING HOUSES. THEIR WORK IS PHYSICALLY TOUGH AND DEMANDING IT'S THE TYPE OF WORK THAT WILL BREAK DOWN YOUR BODY OVER TIME. AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FARMER VERY WAS A LIFELONG FARMWORKERS. AND HE WAS THE MAN WHO HELPED RAISE MY BROTHER NINE AND SO I SAW HOW HOW HARD HE WORKED. DAY IN AND DAY OUT WE WORKED OUTSIDE THE WEATHER IS ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE. AND DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF YEAR SOME WORK DAYS WERE LONGER THAN OTHERS AND HE NEVER MONEY. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW MANY FARMWORKERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY OFTEN LACK ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE COMMON. AND LIVING CRITICALLY OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS. HI AND AS WE HAVE SEEN HAPPEN SINCE THE ONSET OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ACCORDING TO RECENT DATA RELEASED JUST LAST WEEK. THE CO NINETEEN VIRUS SPREAD IN THE FACT IT HAS SPREAD VERY VERY QUICKLY IN CONDITIONS SUCH AS THESE AND CLEARLY AS LONG AS THIS PANDEMIC CONTINUES.

WORKERS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH CONTACT INFORMATION FOR CALLOW SHOP- THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE TO FILE COMPLAINTS ONE SECOND THIS BILL REQUIRES CAL OSHA TO POST ON ITS WEBSITE. ROBUST IN.

YOUR OF I AM BEHALF OF US AND COME A LAGER HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND VOTE ON AB NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE FAMILY CARE GIVER ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT. HI JUSTICE A PROVIDERS WHO CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO AREN'T A CHILD OR SPOUSE ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA LAW EXCLUDES PARENT AND SPOUSE ALL RIGHT IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES PROVIDERS FROM RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PAYMENTS. ABOUT 22% OF HSS PROVIDERS ABOUT A HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND MOSTLY FEMALE FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY. THESE PROVIDERS WHO MAY BECOME UNEMPLOYED DUE TO THE DEATH OF THEIR LOVED ONE ARE LEFT WITHOUT A PAYCHECK OR ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT. EIGHT D. NINETY THREE B. EXTENDS THE PLAN INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY TO PARENT AND SPOUSE I JUST AS PROVIDERS. CARE GIVERS TO HELP CLIENTS WITH MEALS PERSONAL CARE NEEDS AND EVEN PARAMEDICAL SERVICES LIKE MANAGING MEDICATIONS BLOOD TESTING CHARACTER USE AND IN MANY CASES I JUST AS CARE GIVERS BECOME THE CLIENTS ONLY LIFELINE. ESPECIALLY DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WE MUST MAINTAIN PHYSICAL DISTANCE AND STAY AT HOME. THE COMMON NINETEEN PANDEMIC TO SHAPE SHINING A LIGHT ON THE PROBLEMS THAT CALIFORNIA WORKERS FACE SUCH AS LACKING PROTECTIVE GEAR CHILD CARE OR ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. WE MUST ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S A PACE WHERE ALL WORKERS INCLUDING SPOUSE AND PARENT THIS IS PROVIDERS ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. TIMES OF CRISIS AND IN NORMAL TIMES. BECAUSE BY CHURCHES ARE GIVERS MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES STATE WIDE RECEIVER CARE AT HOME. INSTEAD OF IN A NURSING HOME. BUT NEED FOR UNDER STRAIGHT TRIPS TO HEALTH CARE FACILITY HOW. TAX IS FULL POPULAR. FROM OVER NINETY. AND PER THIS FACILITY FOR OVER AND WE CERTAINLY SEE AND USED ABOUT CHALLENGES IN. OUR FACILITIES. UNFORTUNATELY STAGNANT WAGES AND INSUFFICIENT BENEFITS CREATED DANGEROUS SHORTAGE OF CAREGIVERS AS A RESULT MANY CARE GIVERS ARE PARENTS AND SPOUSES. WHO SACRIFICE THEIR OWN CAREERS TO DO THE WORK THEMSELVES PROVIDING THAT CARE. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AS A BASELINE PROTECTION THAT MOST WORKERS RELY UPON EVEN IN NON CRISIS TIMES. SO WE NEED A PERMANENT SOLUTION SO THAT FAMILY CAREGIVERS CAN HAVE THE BASIC EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS ALL THE TIME.

SEPARATE INDEPENDENT LEGAL REPRESENTATION FROM THEIR DISTRICTS ATTORNEY WANTED BUT YOU ALREADY OF THE COMMISSIONERS BELIEVED THE ATTORNEYS ARE COMPROMISED BY A CAR LIKE TO INTEREST. NO COMMISSION SO SERVICE. THAT AND JUST ARE TO THEIR OWN. FAIRLY ONE OF THE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE PERSONNEL COMMISSION IS TO HEAR AND RENDER DECISIONS ON THE DISTRICT'S DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS IN OTHER WORDS IT COMMISSION ACTS IN EQUITIES AYE JUDICIAL CAPACITY REGARDING THE DISTRICT'S ACTIONS. GENERALLY A PERSONNEL COMMISSION RECEIVED HER LEGAL ADVICE FROM THE SAME LAWYERS THAT WORK FOR THE DISTRICT. HOWEVER WHAT HAPPENS OF THE COMMISSION WOULD RATHER RECEIVE SEPARATE LEGAL ADVICE FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL. OR THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH THE DISTRICT UNDER CURRENT LAW- COMMISSIONERS LACKED THE POWER TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY MAY RECEIVE COUNSEL FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN THE DISTRICT'S LAWYERS. AS A RESULT THE PERSON COMMISSION LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO REFUSE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY EVEN WHEN THE COMMISSION FINDS IT APPROPRIATE.

UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS NOT A HOSTILE ACT THAT I AFTER TO BE REMOVED FROM CONSENT I JUST NEEDED TO ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INQUIRE EASE I GOT WERE RECEIVED VERY LATE. ON BUT THEY WERE FOR TWO MAJOR INSTITUTIONS OF MY DISTRICT LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- I COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT I THINK WE HEARD THE WITNESS GOT CUT OFF A BIT AND IT REALLY IS THIS QUESTION OF THE FOR THE- TERM CONFLICT- I HEARD YOUR- PRIMARY- PROPONENT WITNESS STATE THAT ATTEMPTING TO USE THE CALIFORNIA BAR'S RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. WAS NOT APPROPRIATE- BUT BUT I DO HAVE A CONCERN IF THERE IS A DISTRICTS LARA L. A. C. E. B. D. THAT'S CONCERNED. NOT HAVING TO DEFINITE. TERM OF YOU. KIND OF RESPONDING. RESPECT ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR MUCH OF SENATOR PER YOUR QUESTION IN I THINK THE WITNESS SAW TO EXPLAIN SITUATION TO SOME EXTENT I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO FURTHER DEFINE THE TERM THE TERM CONFLICT OF INTEREST ESSENTIALLY IS A TERM THAT HAS BEEN COMMONLY USED. AND OUT AND THE ARE YOU KNOW MOST OF THE COMMISSIONERS ARE NOT TRAINED IN THE LAW AND DOG YOU KNOW THE DAILY OF PEOPLE ESSENTIALLY AND ADDING A LAYER OF DEFINITION TO THE TERM ITSELF COULD. CONFUSE PEOPLE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THE WORST TESTIFIED- HOW WE'RE ASKING NON LAWYERS TO IT BASICALLY INTERPRET WHAT IS THE RULE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT WHICH ACTUALLY TAKES A SOMEWHAT OF A YOU KNOW LEAGUE LEGAL EXPERTISE SO I THINK THAT BASICALLY CONFUSES IN A COMPLICATED MATTER AND ON TOP OF THAT- UNDER CURRENT LAW. ON THE LAWYER FOR THE DISTRICT ARE ALREADY UNDER THE OBLIGATION TO RECUSE IF THEIR POTENTIAL IT PARTICULAR SITUATION SO THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY WOULD PROVIDE THAT MECHANISM FOR THE COURSE NOW COMMISSION TO BASICALLY I DO SOME KIND OF A CHECK AND BALANCE IN. SURE THAT BODY TO SEPARATE. THAT IT DOES THERE'S A CAR. TO ITS YOU KNOW THE GOAL IS PLEASE THE- ALLOW. IN OF YOU KNOW BY ONE BUT FROM THE- THANK YOU IT DOES I THINK A THE EXAM HERE FOR GAY YOU KNOW I OF INTEREST IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD LEGALLY PREVENT ME FROM WAYNE IN IN A DELIBERATION BECAUSE I HAVE SOME POTENTIAL PERSONAL GAIN. THE EXAMPLES THEY GAVE FELT TO ME LIKE IT WAS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THAT LEGAL COUNSEL DIDN'T HONOR THE REQUEST. OF THE BODY- TO MAKE A DECISION- SO. HE HELPED ME UNDERSTAND WHICH WHICH ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE WITH THE WITH THE BILL. BUT B. E. OR THE BILL TRY TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A- POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE PERSONNEL COMMISSION AND THE BOARD ITSELF EITHER THE YOU THE BOARD IS COMMITTEE COLLEGE BOARD OR K. TWELVE BOARD HOUSE WHENEVER THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT MAY PRESENT SOME KIND OF- POTENTIAL CONFLICT. ALL USING THE SAME LAWYER THEN DOT SO WHEN THIS LAW IS INVOKED K. ONE MORE QUESTION IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR AND THIS WAS THE QUESTION POSED BY L. A. U. S. D. BECAUSE THE BILL IS IN KEY FISCAL. THAT'S ALSO I REALIZE THAT THE BILL WOULD GO FROM HERE DIRECTLY TO THE FLOOR WE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THAT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. IT'S NOT KEEP FISCAL BUT- THERE'S CONCERNS THAT IT HAS FISCAL IMPLICATIONS ON SCHOOL DISTRICT AND K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; FOURTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IN THAT THEY WOULD BE. RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR OUTSIDE COUNSEL THAT SOMEONE ARGUE COULD BE AT A HIGHER COST SO COULD YOU RESPOND- TO THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT KEEP FISCAL OF THIS A UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT WE'RE- PUTTING ON DISTRICTS WELL LIKE YOU SAID. THE BILL IS ESSENTIALLY TACKED. ON NONPHYSICAL AND D. A. R. D. EXPECTATION IS THAT THE LAW IS NOT GOING TO BE INVOKED OFTEN TELL THAT FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO MAIN. REASONS WHY IS THAT I THINK GOD FOR CONFLICT BETWEEN BODIES. CLUB SO YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE I ALSO THE IDEA TO THE WITNESS SPONSOR. WILL HAVE FIRST HAND OF DOUBTS THE PLEASURE THE DUTCH. YES I'M SORRY WAS THE QUESTION SHOULD IF COULD DOT THE FOR TO THE- WHO HELP FOR HAND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THIS. OF THE CALL YES. WE CERTAIN COULD. IS THE WITNESS ON THE- HELLO. YES THANK YOU YEAH FEDERAL. MISTER DOLORES- WITH THE CFDA AND WE DON'T SEE THIS AS A FISCAL MATTER BECAUSE AGAIN BILL. THIS LAW HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR DECADES I THINK IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN IT WAS PUT INTO LAW WHICH ALLOWED. WHICH ACTUALLY GAVE PERSONNEL COMMISSION. NOT WHITE. THAT LEGAL COUNSEL. IF THERE'S A CAR. IN IT IF THE LAW. IN THE DISTRICT WHERE NEIL OR SHE HAVE KNOWN. I AM WE DON'T WE THAT THAT IT. AND WE DON'T THINK IT A FISCAL ISSUE BECAUSE THE TOPIC WHEN INITIAL WHEN IT EFFECT. THEY WOULD HAVE ALREADY VALUE WHAT THE COSTS ARE IN IT IN AN ALSO A FINANCIALLY. THAT DISTRICT LAWYER THE REPRESENTING COMMISSION NOW IN BAD EXPENSES BEING COVERED SO WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A COFFEE IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE JUST MINIMAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A IN A PRE YOU A WOMAN FROM ME TO ASK MY- QUESTIONS I RECORD YOU MISTER. THANK VERY MUCH SENATOR MITCHELL- OTHER KEPT QUESTIONS YES SENATOR JACKSON. YES HI OF. I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION HERE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A TECHNICAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST OF INTEREST SO AN ATTORNEY WOULD HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IF FOR EXAMPLE HERE SHE WAS REPRESENTING A CLIENT ON ONE SIDE AND IT REPRESENTED A CLIENT WHO WAS OR HAD BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE- SO THOSE ARE LEGAL CONFLICTS- WHAT I UNDERSTAND AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU COULD VERIFY THIS. IS THIS IS A COMPLEX IF THE TOURNEY SEES THE ISSUE DIFFERENTLY THAN THE ORGANIZATION SO IN OTHER WORDS THEY THE INTERNSHIPS I DON'T AGREE WITH YOUR ANALYSIS AND I'M NOT GOING TO PRESENT THIS ISSUE THE WAY YOU WISH BECAUSE I THINK IT SHOULD BE X. YOU IT SHOULD Y. SO. THAT'S WHAT I DO KNOW IF THAT ISN'T FOR THE CASE BUT THAT'S AS I SEE IT THERE. THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF EXPOSITION IN OUR ANALYSIS BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS A- NO THE OBJECTION AND NO OPPOSITION ADDED REGISTER BUT- IF I AM CORRECT WOULD YOU. A IN THAT IF I'M NOT CORRECT JUST IGNORE THAT THAT IS CORRECT I THINK- YET WHENEVER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN OPINION BETWEEN TWO LAWYERS I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE CONFLICT- POTENTIAL CONFLICT MAY ARISE CORRECT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR CLARIFICATION. OKAY THANK YOU THE BILL HELP OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE TO PASS OF DRY CLOTHES I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL VERY VERY MUCH OF THE CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS. CENTER-HILL HI SENATOR HILL HI CENTER MORALE. BERLEI CENTER MORALE BY CENTER JACKSON. JACKSON AYE CENTER JACKSON BY CENTER MITCHELL MITCHELL IICENTER MITCHELL HI CENTER PAN. CENTER PAN I. ACCORDING TO THE HOUSE FIVE OCEAN AND IT IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER PRECIADO SO WE WILL WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PROBLEM ONE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA IS IT HEAD IN THE ORDER THE FILE ORDER. AND SO HE SHOULD BE GOING TO WE DO HAVE A HARD STOP AT SEVEN PM IS OUR OTHER PROBLEMS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCEDURE. IS IF WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH. A BILL IN TO FINISH IT THE- WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA IS NEXT IN THE FILE. MY APOLOGIES FOR YOUR PATIENCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER BUT- FILE ORDERS THE FILE ORDER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PROBLEMS IN AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY ONE WHICH DEFINES WHEN THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY IS DE MINIMIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING IF THE PREVAILING WAGE APPLIES TO PRIVATE PROJECTS USING PUBLIC FUNDS THE BILL PROVIDES THAT A PUBLIC SUBSIDY ON A PRIVATE PROJECT IS DE MINIMUS SO LONG AS IT IS LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO LESS THAN 2% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. THIS BILL PRESENTS FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR THRESHOLD CONSTRUCTION SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING UNITS UNDER CURRENT LAW A PROJECT IS NOT SUBJECT TO PREVAILING WAGE LAW EVEN IF IT RECEIVES A PUBLIC SUBSIDY IT THAT SUBSIDY IS DE MINIMUS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT ALSO IF THE PROJECT IS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS EXEMPT UNDER LATE BECAUSE SECTION SEVENTEEN TWENTY AND THAT'S ALSO THE CASE IN THIS. AS WELL. THE TO MINIMIZE. DEFINED IN START. THERE IS NO GO. AS TO THEIR PER LEVEL PUBLIC SUBSIDY. THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MINIMIS. THIS IS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF. RELATIONS TO MAKE THINK IT'S- RULES. AS TO WHAT IS. LEADING TO CONVEY. AND COST OF THAT ADDITIONAL WHAT THE TERM ACTUALLY MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED AS DE MINIMIS A ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR. PUBLIC SUBSIDY TO A NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR NOT PROCESSING FACILITY PROJECT SINCE IT WAS ONLY. ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT. THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. A PUBLIC SUBSIDY FOR A PROJECT BY PROJECT THAT IS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWO PERCENT. THE TOTAL PROJECT COSTS AS A NOTABLE. TAXPAYER INVESTMENT. BUT IT IS REASONABLE TO REQUIRE PREVAILINGWAGES OF THE DEVELOPER WANTS PUBLIC SUBSIDY. OF THAT AMOUNT. THE COMPANY NINETEEN PANDEMICS BUT SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL STRAIN OR WORKFORCE. MANY WORKERS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF AFTER HOURS REDUCE OF TAKING UNPAID LEAVE. TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER. THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS FOR A LIVABLE. WAGES PRIOR PROJECTS ARE SUBSIDIZED BY TAXPAYERS. WORKERS ARE PAID THE BILL AND WAGES. ARE MORE LIKELY TO WHETHER THIS CRISIS. SUCCESSFULLY SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES A BUT NECESSARY DOLLARS. BACK INTO A DECIMATED LOCAL ECONOMIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT AND HAVE ONE WITNESS JEREMY SMITH. STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTORS COUNCIL THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH US. OVER YOU DO HAVE TO THE WITNESS TWO WITNESSES ONE WITNESS IN SUPPORT- JEREMY SMITH STATE BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL- YES VERY GOOD THANK YOU. IN THE- THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MISTER THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GERRY SMITH. HERE BE HAPPY STATE BILL AGAINST TRADES. OR THE SPOTS OF AB. TWENTY THIRTY ONE. WHAT ARE CURRENTLY OUR GUIDE IN DEVELOPER TO ACCEPT SUCH TOTAL LESS THAN 2% THE TOTAL OF THE PROJECT AND NOT HAVE TO PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE SUBSIDY IS DE MINIMUS. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL PROJECT. THIS EXCEPTION ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WAS MEANT TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE DEVELOPMENTS DID NOT GET MANDATED TO PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE. FOR SOME INSIGNIFICANT COSTS OF DEVELOPER THAT WERE BORN BY TAXPAYERS LIKE. FEES TO FILE PLANS WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR EXAMPLE OR FOR PUBLIC AT THE GIFTED SOMETHING LIKE PUBLICLY FINANCED PART. TO A PROJECT. DOES NOT MEANT TO ALLOW. AMOUNTS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO BE USED BY DEVELOPERS WITHOUT PAYMENT OF THE PREVAILING WAGE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS HAPPENING. THIS IS BECAUSE SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE DIMINISH THE MINIMIZATION WAS ADOPTED THEN. THE THEN THE I. R. DIRECTOR ISSUED GUIDANCE SAYING HE BELIEVED THAT PARTICULAR PUBLIC SUBSIDY OF SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS THE MINIMUS BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY. ONE POINT 64% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. AFTER THAT THE I. R. SIMPLY ASSUMED IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE FOR COURT DECISION. THAT ANY SUBSIDY OF LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL PROJECT COST IS ALWAYS TO MINIMIZE EVEN IF THE SUBSIDY IS FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NO COURT HAS ADDRESSED THIS NOR HAS THE AYE ARE EVER CITED ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR ITS 2% INTERPRETATION. BEYOND ITS ORIGINAL ORIGINAL LETTER. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE CERTAINTY REGARDING THE NEED TO MINIMIZE ACCORDING TO SEVERAL D. I. R. DETERMINATIONS AS THE POLL HAS A LOT OF OTHER PERSON RECEIVE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES RANGING FROM SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AS MENTIONED. TO FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY DEPENDING WHICH- A AB TWENTY THREE ONE. PAUL AND WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPED PAPER LANGUAGE WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO ACCEPT THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS LOWER CEILING WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON PROJECTS UNDER TWENTY FIVE MILLION. FURTHERMORE AND THEN THAT'S TAKEN LAST YEAR AND PUT IN THIS BILL THIS YEAR. INSURERS OF THE BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO SINGLE FAMILY HOME CONSTRUCTION. WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT AT THE REQUEST OF THE OPPONENTS LAST YEAR EXISTING ISN'T EXEMPTIONS ALREADY EXEMPT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL IN THE IN THE LABOR CODE. THESE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL WILL BE VOLUNTARILY ACCEPTED ON THE PART OF DEVELOPER. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PREVAILING WHICH PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGHLY SKILLED LOCAL WORKERS AND APPRENTICES RECEIVING TRAINING AND STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. AND PROVIDES THEM WITH HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND BENEFITS THAT WE ALL TAKE GRANTED. YOUR ANALYSIS CORRECTLY POINTS OUT THAT FOR REALLY WAIT BUT THERE IS NO COURT BETWEEN LOWER WAGES AND LOWER COSTS. WE WOULD CONTEND THAT DEVELOPER SAVE MONEY BY PROJECTS FINISHING ON TIME AT OR BELOW BUDGET AND BUILD A HIGHER QUALITY WHEN PULLING WORKERS EARNING THE PREVAILING WAGE. FINALLY DURING THIS BEEN RECEPTION RECESSION WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT SCARCE TAXPAYER DOLLARS WERE PROVIDED TO PRIVATE FOLDERS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS GO TO PROVIDE LIVING. WAGES TO CONSTRUCTION. IT IS. THAT WORKERS ARE NOT LEFT. WHAT PUBLIC ARE UTILIZED IT IS FOR THESE THAT WE ARE YOU TO VOTE ON AB. TWENTY THREE ONE. THANK YOU.
