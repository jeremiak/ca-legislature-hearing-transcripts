AND OBSERVATIONS -- THE DOCTOR PAN AND THEN CENTER JULY. I THANK YOU AWESOME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE -- I DID WANT TO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON I THINK WE DOING ISSUES YET OR NOT TWO SEVEN THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAMS IN THE C. THREE LOGIC SYSTEM AND THEN FOLLOWED UP BY ISSUE EIGHT WHICH I THINK ARE LINKED -- TERMS OF DOING RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS AND DATA ANALYSIS CERTAINLY -- YEAH I KNOW THAT WHEN THE ROLES OF THE COMMISSION IS TO BE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE -- TONIGHT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGE WHEN THE PURPOSES SPORT IT MAYBE -- TO TO INJURE SOMEONE BUT WE WILL GET INTO THAT -- BUT I GUESS -- IN TERMS OF I KNOW ANALYSIS IT TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT -- YEAH HOW HOW DO YOU USE THE C. THREE LOGIC DATA ARE YOU DEVELOPING OUR OTHER STATES -- ARE YOU ABLE TO WORK WITH OTHER STATES TO SEE WE CAN -- INCREASE THE DATA AND HOW AND HOW AVAILABLE IS THAT KIND OF DATA -- TO RESEARCHERS WHO -- OUR OTHER INVESTIGATORS WHO WISH. TO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO TO TRY TO MAKE THE SPORT SAFER. CAN SHE SAID. THANK YOU DOCTOR DOCTOR IN DR CENTER PAN -- WE'VE WE'VE ONL BEEN DOING THE C. THREE LOGIC SYSTEM FOR ABOUT. TWO YEARS AND IN THAT TWO YEARS WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BASS LINE OUR LICENSE BASED BY GETTING A PICTURE OF THE WAY THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS USE AND SEE THREE PROTOCOLS. OKAY. WE ARE JUST ENTERED IN IN SINCE THE WILL. LITERALLY THE LAST COMMISSION MEETING WE TALKED ABOUT IT WE'RE MOVING INTO A PHASE TWO FOR NOW WE HAVE PICTURES OF IT AND AND AND INFORMATION ON ALL THE VARIOUS FATHERS BASELINE THEIR BRAIN FUNCTIONS. WE CAN NOW START TO ASCERTAIN LOOK AT HOW THIS INFORMATION IS NEXT TIME WE DO IT AGAIN -- OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE CONDUCTED OVER ONE THOUSAND OVER ONE THOUSAND TESTS WERE WHAT ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED TEST RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THE STAGE WHERE LAS AND SOME POPULATION POFESSIONAL ATHLETES. AND I WHAT I'M NOT GOING SAY EVERYBODY'S BEEN DOING BUT BECAUSE THERE'S PEOPLE GO HERE AND THERE BUT THE MAJORITY IS DONE. SO SOMEBODY GET STOPS MAKE IS KNOCKED OUT. WE WANT TO SEE. HOUSE THIS PERSON'S BRAIN FUNCTION HAVE THEY RETURNED TO BASELINE. AND IF THEY HAVE RETURNED TO BASELINE THEN THAT COULD BE ONE TOOL THAT THE DOCTORS USED TO CLEAR THEM -- SO WE JUST NOW ENTERING INTO PHASE. TWO BUT IT SAYS -- I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION SHARING OF THE DATA WITH THE SOURCE THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. THAT THE DATA IS -- CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT USING THE RIGHT NOW I KNOW THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP THE PROMOTION IS ALSO USING THE SAME SYSTEM TO BASED ON THEIR FATHER'S. WE ARE SHARING -- WITH PERMISSION FROM THE ATHLETES OF COURSE WITH WITH THAT PROMOTION THEY SHARE WITH US. BUT CALIFORNIA'S LEADING LEADING THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE SPORTS AND SO JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I AM I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID PHASE ONE IS GETTING THE BASELINE DATA AND THEN YOU HAVE FACED TO I MEAN HOW MNY PHASES ARE THERE CAN YOU. JUST GO BRIEFLY TELL ME WITH OKAY NOW YEAH PHASE ONE THE BASELINE DATA ON THIS LIKE THE LARGEMENT VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR FIGHTERS -- WHAT'S THE FOLLOW UP ON ON THAT AND ALSO -- I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE AND AGAIN WHAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO ENGAGE OTHER -- STATES OR OTHER TO TO EXPAND THAT DATABASE. NOW THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THE OPPORTUNITY AT THIS POINT IS YOU KNOW WHAT THE NEXT AB DISSOCIATION OF BOXING COMMISSIONS CONFERENCE I CAN I CAN MAKE SOME -- MOVEMENTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO SEE IF OTHER STATES ARE INTERESTED TO SEE IF WE CAN SHARE -- BUT THE NEXT PHASE IS TO GET NHI&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; NEAR -- READINGS ONLY SPOTTERS AND THEN THE THING IS TO TRACK THE FATHER'S AS THEY GO ALONG TO PRO LONG NEUROLOGICAL HEALTH OKAY SO YOU'RE GONNA DO LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW UP IT'S THAT THAT. WILL THAT LUNCH TO NO FOLLOW UP ACTUALLY CONTINUE BEYOND THAT SAY. THE FIGHTERS FIGHTING DAYS I MEAN -- BECAUSE SOME OF THE ENTRIES MAYBE LONG TERM AS WE KNOW ABOUT CITY AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. SIR TENSION THAT. THERE'S GONNA BE FOLLOW UP YOUR LONG TERM FOLLOW UP BEYOND -- THE TIME WHICH SOMEONE MAY BE ACTIVE -- THAT THAT WOULD BE THE INITIAL IDEA MEAN THAT THE INFORMATION IS WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TO THE FATHERS -- BUT THAT I DON'T. WE WE WE WE REALLY HAVEN'T WERE TRYING TO GET TO THE POINT NOW OF WHAT WE'RE DOING EVERYBODY AGAIN. AND AND FOLLOW IN AND IN AS WE GO ALONG OBVIOUSLY DESIGNS GETS BETTER EVERYTHING GETS BETTER AND THERE'S BEEN IMPROVEMENTS SO THE IDEA IS TO CONTINUE TO JUST MONITOR THE NEUROLOGICAL HEALTHY ATHLETES MAKE SURE THE RETURN PLACE AND MAYBE. NOT DEPEND QUICKER. INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE MAC FUNCTIONS IN THEIR REVIEW OF THE STATE. THE THE THE MEDICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS REVIEW IN THE DATA THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE DATA TO GOING TO TO EXAMINE THE DATA ESPECIALLY IF WE HAVE A FATHER -- WHO PERHAPS -- WE CONDITIONS JUST YET. THE DOCTORS WILL LOOK AT THAT DATA COMMISSION HAS A MEDICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. A WE APPOINTED POSITIONS ON THIS COMMITTEE ITS ITS SEVEN MEMBER. FRANK FIVE MEMBER WITH KNOWLEDGE OF SIN ALL DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AREAS SO THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE DOCTOR PAM I WISH THEY WERE HERE THEY COULD. PROBABLY GIVE YOU A MUCH BETTER EXPLANATION OF THE PROTOCOLS AN ONGOING REVIEW AND SOME BUT WE CAN GET MORE INFORMATION IF YOU ABOUT THAT YEAH OF APPRECIATED IF. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A MORE TIME THE HEARING ON THIS BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT -- DE IMPORTANT I MEAN IT'S I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS AND THIS KIND OF INFORMATION COULD BE IMPORTANT. TO NOT ONLY OF COURSE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND AND THE SPORTS THAT YOU'RE OVERSEEING BUT ALSO IN OTHER SPORTS IN TERMS CONCUSSIONS AND OTHER TYPES OF HEAD INJURIES AND I HOPE THAT. THIS DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE WITH THE APPROPRIATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. TO RESEARCHERS AS WELL AND ALSO THAT -- THAT AGAIN CALIFORNIA BEING IN THE LEADING EDGE -- THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DO MORE LONGITUDINAL FILE SURE SAFETY AND ALSO A GREATER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE TRAUMA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ARCHULETA FOLLOWED BY SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU -- AS WE ALL KNOW THE CITY CALIFORNIA. WHETHER IT BE THIS COMMISSION OR THE OTHER. THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST WE ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT BECAUSE WE ARE -- AND WE ARE LOOKING AT A BENCH IN TEXAS NEW YORK NEW JERSEY NEVADA. AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DOES YOUR STAFF FOLLOW. pIN OTHER STATES MAKE SURE THAT OUR STANDARDS ARE BEING MET. AND IF WE HAVEN'T. MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT WHY WHY DON'T WE FOLLOW RATHER THAN JUST. HEAR FROM OR TAX FROM WORK IN AN EMAIL FROM BUT ACTUALLY SENT STAFF MEMBERS EVERY SO OFTEN. AS AN OVERSIGHT TO SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS. SO WE KNOW THAT THE THE PARTICIPANTS ARE TRULY PROTECTED AS WE JUST HEARD POSSIBLE HEAD INJURIES OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE BUT THEY HAVE STAFF GO. WOULD YOU CAN. ANSWER THAT FOR ME. IT'S A GOOD IDEA IF WE DON'T WE DON'T SEND STAFF TO THE OTHER STATES. BROUGHT DOWN WHEN OUR WHEN THE ATHLETES FROM THE STATE GOING COMPETE -- IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA. CALIFORNIA'S -- YOU ARE CORRECT SIR CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS ARE THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY ACROSS ALL. RANGES OF COMBAT SPORTS -- SO IF YOU GO TO A DIFFERENT STATE IN THE NEW YORK HAS COMPARABLE STANDARDS BUT NOT NOT. NOT TO THE LEVEL -- BUT OTHER STATES -- SIR ARE -- THERE'S SEVERAL STATES THAT. THAT ARE NOT UP TO THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS SO IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA AND I APPRECIATE YOU REYES AND WELL I I THINK -- AND IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR JUST MAKE THAT IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT PERIODICALLY YOU CAN SEND SOME YOURSTAFF YOURSELF. TO TO VISIT SOME OF THESE OF COURSE ABOUT AS CLOSE AS JUST TO GO AND SEE AND AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR CALIFORNIA PARTISAN ON OUR STANDARD EACH. YES SIR IT'S THAT'S AN EXCELLENT DEAL WITH THOSE US VIA CALIFORNIA DISPENSED NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT PENSIONS AND WHAT YOUR PLAN TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND THEM ARE. OF PENSIONS ARE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE I THINK SPECIALLY IN A SPORT WHERE YOUR SHELF LIFE IS A LITTLE SHORTER MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THESE ATHLETES WHEN THEY RETIRE IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN MOVING FORWARD TO IMPROVE THEM. MYSTERY THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU FOR ASKING US THE QUESTION CHANCE TO ANNOUNCE IT PUBLICLY. THAT OTHER THAN CALPERS -- THE CALIFORNIA SAYS THAT A COMMISSION HAS BOXES PENSION FUND. OF THE FUNDS PROXIMALLY TEN YEARS OLD NOW. IT'S WITH THE NEW VERSION OF THE NEW VERSION IT'S A A PROF HAS A BOUNCE FROM THE PRESS ME FIVE MILLION THAT MAINTAINS ITSELF VERY WELL. AND A NUMBER OF AREAS TO TRY TO FIND FIGHTERS THAT THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THEIR BENEFITS -- WITH THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THERE IS AND GET NEW OF DISCLOSURE OF FIGHTERS NAMES THAT ARE BEING POSTED ON A STATE WEBSITE. TO HELP LOCATE THEM WE ARE MAKING DISTRIBUTIONS IT IS A GOOD THING IT IS ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD THING. AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FOR A BOX OR WHAT WOULD THEIR MONTHLY AMOUNT BE -- IT'S MA'AM IT'S A ONE TIME PAY ALICE IS A LUMP SUM PAYMENT IT IS AND AND I THINK SOMETIMES WE USE THE TERM PENSION AND THAT'S THE TERM THE LAW BUT IT. THE AVERAGE IS NOT IS NOT LIFE CHANGING MONEY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALTHOUGH WE WE JUST HAVE PAID ONE OUT RECENTLY THAT WAS EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND I GUESS ALL HUNDRED AND SOMETHING THOUSAND LAST YEAR SOMETIME SO SOMETIMES IT. THE THE PSALMS GET GET LARGER LARGER -- BUT IT IT IS HELPFUL FOR THE BOXERS THEY'RE PLEASED TO GET IT AND AND YOU KNOW -- WE WE'VE THEY THEY'VE SO THANKFUL THEY'RE SO HAPPY WHEN YOU GIVE IT IN THIS ONE OF THE MORE REWARDING EXPERIENCE OF THIS JOB TO GIVE TO GIVE SOMEONE THEIR PENSION ABSOLUTELY. AND WHAT IS THE CRITERIA WHAT HOW WOULD I GET TWENTY THOUSAND VERSUS. EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND HOW MANY ROUNDS OF YOU FOUGHT SENATOR. THAT WOULD BE NICE WELL ACTUALLY ONE TIME IN THIRD GRADE AND I DIDN'T FARE WELL. I I DID LEARN TO USE MY WORDS INSTEAD OF MY FACE. HOW MANY ROUNDS HAVE MANY AND MANY TIMES YOU FALL IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A VERY VERY STRICT YOU HOW MUCH YOUR PURSE WAS BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S PROGRESSIVELY SET SO THAT? HIGH PROFILE BOXERS ARE MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ARE NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY PAID COMPARED TO A BOXER MIKE HUNDRED AROUND OR YOU KNOW SO IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMEWHAT PROGRESSIVE IN THAT CASE I WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE -- TO TO EXPAND THAT AND I THINK THAT FOR THE SPORT ESPECIALLY IT'S MUCH NEEDED THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A NOUN OR TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA FOLLOWED BY SHOWMANSHIP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JOHN THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION I WANTED TO GO TO ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE IN YOUR REPORT -- SPEAKING TO GENDER -- ISSUES YOU MAY KNOW THAT ONE OF MY OUR COLLEAGUES HAS INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO TRYING TO DRESS -- EQUITY ISSUES WHEN IT COMES UP PARTICULARLY -- TO PERSONS ARE WINNING -- OF ATHLETIC COMPETITORS A CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT -- YOUR COMMISSION IS DONE ON THAT OUR IS ANTICIPATION OF THAT OBVIOUSLY IT'S INTRODUCED LOTS NOT THERE YET BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED A LOT OF WE SHOULD REQUIRE A LOT TO DO THIS IT SEEMS JUST BEAR BUT CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT LEVEL OF OF EQUITY FOR GENDER. BOTH WOMEN IN -- SO SO. I'M GIVE YOU KIND OF A DETAILED ANSWER THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS WHAT I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE BIGGER PROBLEMS AFFECT IN EQUITY FOR FEMALE BOXERS VERSUS MALE BOXERS. AND I'M. HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOUR OFFICE THE CHART THAT WE DID THAT MADE THE COMPARISON. TWO MEN IT VERSUS THREE MINUTE ROUNDS. OKAY. TV BLOCKS ARE SET UP FOR THREE MINUTE ROUNDS SO WHEN -- OF T. V. A PROMOTER GETS -- GETS -- GETS A FIVE THEY'RE LOOKING AT BLOCKS OF TIME. QUE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS DOESN'T FUNCTION QUAD AS WELL AND AND AND FOR A LONG TIME WE FALL TWO MINUTES AND WE STILL. WOMEN ARE TOO MANY MEN THREE MEN IT CHAMPIONSHIP FOR WOMEN OR STAND AROUND CHAMPIONSHIP FOR MANNER TWELVE ROUNDS. MIXED MARTIAL ARTS IS NOT THAT WAY. WE MADE THE DECISION BACK IN ABOUT TWO OUT BELIEVES TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED THAT THE THAT WOMEN FOUGHT THE SAME AS ME IN. FIVE IN FIVE FIVE MINUTE ROUNDS. RONDA ROUSEY'S ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS SPOTTERS THAT THAT THAT THAT HAS BEEN. GâY WE HAVE A LOT OF FEMALES THAT ARE UP IN COMMON IN THE RANKS AND I BELIEVE. I WANT TO SEE MORE DATA TO LOOK AT IT BUT I CAN'T SEE A GOOD RATIONAL REASON. NOW. AND I WASN'T THIS. THOUSAND EIGHT BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU SITTING HERE TODAY THAT I SEE A GOOD REASON WHY WOMEN CAN'T FOUGHT THREE MINUTE ROUNDS AND IF THEY FALL THREE MINUTE ROUNDS. I THINK AT THAT POINT YOU SEE AN EQUITY INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE STUDY THAT WE DID THE TEN ROUND FEMALE FIGHTERS MADE MORE THAN THE TEN AROUND MALE FIGHTERS OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP LEVEL. I THINK THAT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD IN SOME RESPECTS. THAT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T PROFESS TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE SECURITIES -- OF OF THESE CATCHES AND HOW THEY WORK -- BY APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO STARTED JUSTIN -- SOME OF THESE THINGS AT JUST BECAUSE WE'VE ALWAYS ALWAYS DONE IN A PARTICULAR WAYS BY ONE OF THE WORST EXCUSES FOR ANYTHING -- I THINK IN REGARD TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE MORE THAN HALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE HAVE AN EQUAL SHOT MAKING ENDS MEET -- I APPRECIATE THE STATE AGREED WITH AND AS THIS ENTITY OF FURTHERING THE SAME SO THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND PLEASE KEEP PERSISTING THAT IN THURSDAY YOU CAN SHARE WITH MY OFFICE -- I'D BE INTERESTED SEE. BIG SUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMANSHIP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOWN AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA OUT -- AUS. PART OF MY QUESTION SO I WOULD BE FOCUSING ON OWN COULD YOU ELABORATE -- ON THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT TO AFFLECK [inaudible] LOCAL -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHEERS -- THAT DISCRIMINATION -- HAS NO PLACE ANY COMBAT SPORTS -- THAT. I'M A FORMER COMPETITOR. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. IN THE IN LOOK WE WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ROOM WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND I THINK WE HAVE STARTED ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. BUT FRANKLY SERVER WE'RE I DIDN'T WHEN I GOT INTO A CAGER WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT WHEN I PUT ON THE GLOVES. I DIDN'T CARE [inaudible] IF. IN. IT WE ALL BLEED RED. OKAY WE ALL BLEED RED AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ONLY. I THINK IN THIS INDUSTRY. THE FATHERS IN THIS INDUSTRY. ALL A ARE SOME OF THE MOST -- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IS NOT THIS IS NOT A DISCRIMINATORY TOP INDUSTRY DID THIS INDUSTRY IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT MCCALL'S FODDER SPOT WE FIGHT EACH OTHER. AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT LET. DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN JUST THE FIVE IN THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THAT SPECIAL OR SOMETHING THAT MAKES THAT SPECIAL DISCRIMINATION IS NOT PART OF AND COULD YOU. EXPLAIN TO CHEN CHIU BOTH ABOUT WE HAD THIS HOW THE MATCH MAKING. MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO YOU WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DID IN AND I'M. WE HAD A LOT OF MEDIA ATTENTION AROUND THAT PARTICULAR -- BY OUT A DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT I TREATED IT JUST LIKE. A NORMAL MATCH. HAD A PRO DEBUT FODDER IN MAKING A DEBUT HAD A DEEP AMATEUR BACKGROUND I GOT SUBMITTED A FATAH BELIEVE THE FIRST SPOT WAS THIRTEEN THEY WANTED THEY WANTED. A THIRTEEN ON A ROUTE FIVE EXPERIENCED -- AND I SAID THE MATCH MAKER NOW THAT THIS IS NOT RIDE THE WE'RE NOT GONNA PROVE THIS MATCH. THE CAME BACK WITH A DIFFERENT OPPONENT US THAT THIS IS OKAY. THAT'S HOW THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT ON EVERY FOUGHT. AND THERE'S NO -- BUT THERE'S NO GRAY AREA AND AND AND THE FIGHTER ONE THIRTY NINE THIRTY SEVEN IF MY MEMORY SERVES A LOST AROUND. ONE THREE OF THE FOUR AND IT WAS A GOOD IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS LIKE A GOOD MATCH AND NOW. I HAVE A FATHER WHO'S MORNING NO. AND I'LL BE MATCH MAKING OVERSIGHT PROVIDE A MATCH MAKING OVERSIGHT ACCORDINGLY ON ONE AND FODDER [inaudible] THAT'S I DON'T LOOK AT IT ANY DIFFERENT WITH THAT THAT'S THE NUTS AND BOLTS MISTER CHAIRMAN OF TREATING PEOPLE RESPECTFULLY AN OBJECTIVELY PARTICULARLY COMBAT ATHLETES. ADDITION AS A COMMISSION WE APPOINTED A SUBCOMMITTEE ON GENDER EQUALITY. THEIR TO FEMALE -- COMMISSIONERS. ARE HEADING UP THAT COMMITTEE AND WILL LOOK INTO NOT JUST OF PROTECTION. OF THE RIGHTS -- AND THE STIGMA THAT COULD BECOME LAW OUTSIDE THE COMMISSION THE COMMISSION STAFF CORRECT. BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEIR OF THEIR ISSUES IN GYMNASIUMS ABOUT WOMEN'S PROTECTION AND OTHER THINGS THAT THE COMMISSION CAN PAY ATTENTION TO AND SHOULD. BE PAYING ATTENTION TO SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION AND HE SAID NO TWO THINGS KNOW HAT WHERE IT WE FUNCTION WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO IT. AND THAT OUR STAFF FOR TREATING THESE PEOPLE WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT ANY FIGHTER WOULD RECEIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LIKE TO HEAR THAT. THE VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY MA'AM COMMITMENT MANY MEMBERS AT THIS TIME SEEN NONE -- CHECK LATER. WELL FIRST THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- AND I CAN TELL PASSION FOR THIS US SPORT -- I WANT. TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR WORKING WITH OUR STAFF TO ADDRESS -- THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS TODAY WE'RE NOT GOING THROUGH EACH POINT. BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL -- ENGAGEMENT ON THOSE POINTS -- CERTAINLY TAKE -- AT A LOT OF PRIDE. IN THE THE WORK -- YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT -- HOW MANY MORE -- ACTIVE IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY -- BUT THE I GUESS THE THING THAT -- ANNA AND I APPRECIATE DR PANS ENGAGEMENT ON THE C. THREE LOGIC. DATA ABOUT HOW THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO US BUT I GUESS -- THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT WEE -- OUT THERE THAT WORRY THAT -- AS WE LEARN MORE AND MORE ABOUT HEAD TRAUMA. THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY SHOW UP. RIGHT AWAY. AND I GUESS I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT. YOU KNOW FIGHTERS WHO HAVE FOUGHT TWENTY YEARS AGO. ARE YOU STILL IN TOUCH WITH THEM -- HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE SPORT -- IN IN TRYING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT -- WE SHOULD MOVE A LITTLE BIT MORE RAPIDLY IN THIS ISSUE OF FIGHTER SAFETY. AT WHAT WHERE THE ASSESSMENTS -- THAT YOU HAVE THE EXAM AND BEYOND THIS BASELINE -- ISSUE THAT -- WITH THE C. THREE LOGIC. DATA CAN TO ADDRESS THAT TO ANY FREE THROUGH THE INSURANCE GLAZER ON A ANTI WROTE A NOTE TO ME. ABOUT A SOMETHING THAT THE I THINK MY TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION SIR -- WE ARE WE LEADING THE WAY RIGHT NOW WE'VE HELD SUMMITS IN LOS ANGELES AND BIG. HOTEL ROOMS. WE INVITED WHAT WE JOKINGLY REFERRED TO AS THE FIVE FAMILIES KNOWS THAT THE SANCTIONING BODIES. WBC THE NO THE ACRONYMS W. B. AS OF YET THEY ALL COME IN WE BRING IN STAKEHOLDERS TEST AND EXPERTS. AND WE TALK ABOUT RAPID DEHYDRATION RAPID REHYDRATION AND WAIT CUTTING IN CREATING APPROPRIATE WEIGHT CLASS. REASON I'M ANSWERING YOU ABOUT. IT CUTTING. THEY'RE ALL TIED TO IT AND BANNED SUBSTANCES FOR ALL TIED TO HEALTH AND SAFETY OF FIGHTER. WHEN YOU DEHYDRATE YOU WORKING SHRINK? QUESTION CONCUSSION IS LIKELY TO BE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU GET IN THOSE KINDS OF STATE SO YOU WAKE UP AND YOU HYDRATE YOU RAPIDLY REHYDRATE. YOU PUTTING YOURSELF IN THOSE POSITIONS THIS IS NEW WHEN WE TALK TO FIGHTERS I LITERALLY GET. MY HAIR STANDS AND I WAS LITTLE I HAVE LEFT ON THAT HAVE NO IDEA. THE EFFECTS WHEN WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS ON THEIR BODIES SO BECAUSE OF THE WORK IN AND HE'S BEEN DOING ON THIS IN THE COMMISSION IS DOING. A LOT OF INFORMATION IS GETTING OUT THERE WEIGHT CLASSES APPROPRIATE WALKING AROUND WE QUESTIONED BEING ESTABLISHED. REDUCING THE WAY IN TIMES AND AND MEN MANIPULATING THOUGH SO THEY CAN'T HARDER TO DROP A LOT OF WEIGHT AND THEN REGAIN AT THESE THINGS THAT WERE FOCUSED ON OR GO DIRECTLY ADDRESSING. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY FROM A CONCUSSION SAMPLING. AND THEN HOPEFULLY THAT IF THEY WHAT IF THEY FIGHT AT THE APPROPRIATE WEIGHT AND DON'T DO THESE DRASTIC MEASURES. THEY'LL STAY AS HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER AND THEN HAVE A FUTURE. SO THAT IT DOES THAT WOULD REJECT HAS SOMETHING TO THAT THE I MEAN. NO I THINK THAT MEAN THAT SUMS UP WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND AND AND FOLLOWING UP WITH THE FATHERS THAT HAVE? LONG SINCE SINCE RETIRED -- I THINK DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IN CONTINUING TO TRY TO IMPROVE AND AND AND INTO DO BETTER -- IS HELP ON ONE THING THAT WE DO AND I'M SURE THAT YOU GOT A YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE WROTE THE LAW -- WE HAVE BEEN MORE HOURS ON ALL THE FATHERS AND WE HAVE THAT PERIODICALLY AND WE'RE JUST PASS AND REGULATIONS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER THAT WE GET ON THAT THE PERIOD THE PERIODIC INSTEAD OF EVERY FIVE YEARS WILL BE DOING IT EVERY THREE YEARS -- THE ONE THING THAT SEE THREE DOES SIR AND AND I DIDN'T GET THE S. UNTIL I WE STARTED THIS PROGRAM. IS THE BRAIN CAN LOOK THE SAME -- WITH VERY MUCH VERY SIMILAR IN A PICTURE AND THAT THERE'S NOT PHYSICAL CHANGES BUT SEE THREE WILL TRACK THE NEUROLOGICAL FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN. VERSES THE PHYSICAL -- FUNCTION OF THE BRAIN AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE [inaudible] TWO IN. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT SIR AND I DON'T WANT THE WORD YOU'RE MOUTH BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE VOTERS HAVE GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE LATER. WE DON'T WANT THE NEUROLOGICAL DECLINED TO AFFECT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE LATER. SOMETHING ENOUGH I KNOW I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING WE WANT AS WELL. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STARTING THIS NEUROLOGICAL FUNCTION -- PROTOCOLS AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE CALIFORNIA'S LICENSEES YET SO I I APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE THE WITH WITH THE WORK IN THE FOCUS ON HYDRATION AND AND WAIT -- I JUST WONDER IF WE'RE JUST RUNNING AWAY FROM A FAX THAT'S OUT THERE AND THAT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO CONFRONT. WHICH IS HOW HAVE THESE FIGHTERS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE SPORT GOING BACK TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS WHICH MEANS THERE THIRTY AND FORTY YEARS OLD. OR THOSE THAT ARE -- FOR YOUR FIFTH EFFECT OF THIS -- COMBAT SPORT ON THEIR LIVES -- AND THAT I GUESS I'M HEARING FROM YOU THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD AND YOU HAVE SOME ACTIVITIES THAT YOU THINK WILL HELP MAKE THE SPORT SAFER. BUT IS THERE NO -- WORK TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS. ON THOSE WHO'VE COME BEFORE. ONE THING I COULD ADD. SENATOR THAT -- FOR FOR ME TO IS THAT A LOT OF THE FIGHTERS TO COME TO THE EVENTS. AROUND THE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE EVENTS AND ENTER THE VENTS AND YOU GET TO MEET THEM THE FAMOUS ONES THAT WE'VE PROBABLY ALL HEARD OF AND BY THEIR VERY PRESENCE YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT OF THE LONG CAREER. PARTICULARLY -- CAREER -- THAT MAYBE I WENT BACK TO THE DAYS OF MUHAMMAD ALI WHEN THEY FOUGHT EVERY MONTH. AND THEY FOUGHT YOU KNOW. NUMEROUS ROUNDS AND I HAD ALL THESE FIGHTS WORK TODAY. THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ANY LONGER SO. MAYBE BY THEIR PRESENCE THERE IS SOME EXAMPLE BUT THERE IS NO REAL. KIND OF STUDY OR OR DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT BUT IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA AND I'M SURE THAT SOME OF THEM WOULD BE WILLING. TO TO MENTOR AND I THINK DOING MENTOR YOUNG FIGHTERS ON THE CLEVELAND CLINIC LATER ONE CLINIC IS DOING A STUDY ON THAT WELL I I I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AND UNSETTLED. YET -- THE THERE'S LOTS OF IT YOU KNOW RATIONALIZATIONS FOR FOR HOW WE DO THINGS. AND I I IT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE ENERGY THAT YOU'RE PUTTING INTO HOW WE CAN DO IT BETTER. BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO OWN UP TO THE PAST. AND AND IT MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE AND MAYBE STARK BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO BE IGNORED AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RAISE THESE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINAL QUESTION FROM SOMEONE WITHOUT. THE RESEARCHER AND SO JUST. TO SO I HAVE A SON WHO JUST PLACED FIFTH IN THE STATE IN WRESTLING OF LAST WEEKEND AND SO HE'S BEEN HE WAS TO TWENTY WHEN HE CAME IN FOR FOOTBALL AND HE CAN'T WAIT -- TO ONE NINETY FIVE SO HYDRATION IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT IS VERY CRITICAL -- TO FIGHTER OR WRESTLER ANYBODY COMPETITIVE SPORTS BUT IN THIS INDUSTRY. WEIGHT HAS TO DO WITH WHERE YOU'RE BRACKETED AND WORRY AND SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THE THAT WELL I KNOW THE CIF AND AND THE HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS HAVE A REALLY. DETAILED HYDRATION PLAN YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN ONLY CUT WEIGHT SO FAST. WHAT WHAT ABOUT THAT IN TERM PERIOD BETWEEN WHERE THEY GO PRO OR THEY THERE AND THERE'S THERE'S REALLY NO RATE THERE IF THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE SPOT FROM? HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE MAYBES ACTIVITIES. TO THE PRO RAIKES WHO'S MONITORING THAT ARIAN THERE BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY A WHOLE BUNCH OF THIS DATA IN THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY. IN A REGULATED ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE DOING IT IS JAMMED SOMEWHERE -- TRYING TO GET TO THE TO THE RANK. SIR A FOR FOR AMATEUR MMA PROGRAM. FOR LET'S BE CLEAR WHITE CUTTINGS A BIG PROBLEM IN BOTH THE SPORTS BUT IT'S BIGGER PROBLEM MIXED MARTIAL ARTS BECAUSE OF THE WRESTLING BACKGROUND THAT YOU JUST. DID YOU JUST LAID OUT -- BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DELEGATES TO ARAM AT YOUR ORGANIZATION CALLED CAMO AND THEY THEY PROVIDE. ME ALL THE DATA. OWN THE FONTS ROM THE AMATEUR RANKS SO I'M ABLE TO VIEW IT. OKAY SO YOUR POINT IF I SEE A MIDDLE WAY TO ANIMATE ONE EIGHTY FIVE READ BALK ONE EIGHTY FIVE THE ENTIRE TIME. A LOT OF TIMES THEN GOSPEL FLINK. I WOULD BE BETTER IF. FIFTY FIVE AND THEY'LL TRY TO CUT THAT. YEAH OUT I'VE GOT WE GOT A NEW SYSTEM IN PLACE AND PART OF IT -- PART OF ITS LICENSE IN MY WEIGHT CLASS IMAGINE THAT CONCEPT THAT I WOULDN'T DONE THREE YEARS AGO. AND NOW WE'RE LICENSE IN THE WEIGHT CLASS HAVE THE DOCTOR CERTIFY THIS IS APPROPRIATE WEIGHT CLASS FOR YOU -- SO THAT THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE STILL CUT IN A LOT OF WEIGHT LET'S BE CLEAR BUT THEY'RE NOT. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE NUMBER START TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT. AND I THINK PART OF IT IS IF YOU GET THESE REAL DRASTIC WHITE CUTTERS -- FOR EXAMPLE YES YESTERDAY I WAS LOOKING AT ONE WE HAVE NOT SEEN PERCENT INCREASE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT NOT TEEN PERCENT -- AT THAT PERSON'S GONNA IN HERE AND YOU WAIT CLASS IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE. TO FIVE NOT ONLY IS IT ON HEALTHY IT'S CHEATING. OKAY HAD ONE IF I HAD ONE LAST YEAR AND I GOT A NEW WEIGHT CLASS. ONE FORTY FIVE AND ONE FORTY SIX WHY IAN DAY. ONE FIFTY FOUR AND ONE SEVENTY THE NEXT DAY [inaudible] OKAY. YOU SUCK TALKING ABOUT A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN BODY WEIGHT. AND IT'S ON HELP THE IT'S DANGEROUS IN TO GET TO YOUR POINT I THINK IT. AND THE DOCTOR SAYING THE THANK AND THEY AGREED IT CONTRIBUTES TO CONCUSSIONS IT'S RELATED TO DRUG TESTING BECAUSE THEY TAKE THESE DRUGS IN ORDER TO CUT THIS WHITE BUT MAINTAIN THEIR THEIR THEIR STRAND THEIR MUSCLE MASS THEIR STORY AND THEY GET LANE DOWN. THEY TAKE DIURETICS TO HELP THEM THE IT'S VERY WE TRANSPORTED QUALIFY YOU FIGHTERS FROM Y. IAN'S. CALL IN THE AIMED WANTS TO THE WHITE IAN IS NOT PART OF THE DEAL. EVERYBODY UP YOUR NOSE SPOTTING IS DANGEROUS THERE'S I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND TELL YOU IT'S NOT DANGEROUS THAT'S WHILE WE'RE HERE WE TRY TO MAKE THIS A SITE VISIT CAN BE IT'S A DANGEROUS ACTIVITY. BUT WEIGHING ME AND SHOULD NOT BE DANGEROUS. WHERE ADDRESS IN IT WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN OUR OB THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS? THIS IS THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE LOOK DRUG TESTING IS HARD I HAVE TO USE A SCIENTIST UCLA IT TELL ME THIS ISN'T I CAN USE THIS WITH THE SCALE I CAN LOOK AT MY EYES EASILY THEM WHY IAN'S UNLIKE. YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE BILLION BUT YOUR SON WRESTLES HE MIGHT HAVE YOU SEEN WATER LOAD YOU SEEN THAT PRACTICE BEFORE WHERE THEY TAKE AWAY THE GALLONS OF WATER AND DRINK YOU. IN THE NEXT DAY THEY DRINK A LITTLE LESS THAN THAT ACTUALLY SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER THIS FORCES THE KIDNEYS JUST BOW OUT WATER YOU CAN JUST CUT ALL CONNELL. THAT'S NOT HEALTH. HE ONLY KNEW THAT SO MANY TIMES THAT SOME BAD THINGS HAPPEN. IN EASILY THAT WAY WE'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF THAT STUFF FOR TRYING TO HAVE PEOPLE. FIVE REGULAR WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER LICENSING BYE WEEK CLASS. SO WE DO. SO WHAT BEING PART OF THIS SPORT. FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS I'VE BEEN IN A GYM EVERYDAY WATCHING MY SON RUSSELL. AND HE'S SO LIKE I SAID HE WAS A TWO TWENTY FOOTBALL PLAYER AND HE'S A ONE NINETY FIVE TO ONE NINETY SEVEN WRESTLER BUT HE'S AT THE WEIGHT WHERE HE'S NOT HAPPENED IT WERE ANY STRONG THERE. YEAH. THAT'S LETTING UNLESS THE OTHER THING IS YOU WATCH HIM CUT AND THEIR WEEK THEY CAN'T FIGHT IN WHERE THEY CAN'T THEIR STREET IS NOT THERE. BUT MY WHAT I WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON FOR ME IS THAT I'VE WATCHING THIS FOR A LONG TIME THERE'S A LOT OF KIDS I THINK ARE CUTTING TO MUCH WEIGHT YEAH. AND THEY'RE NOT STRONG. THEY THEY GET WEEK WHAT WE NEED TO TRACK IT OVER TIME WE NEED TO WE NEED TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WORKS FROM THAT MY SON'S BEEN RUSSELL SAYS HE'S THREE YEARS OLD. NOW THOSE WERE JUST LITTLE ROLL AROUND COUPLE ROUNDS YOU KNOW AND HE WAS OUT OF THERE. AND THEN THE KID WAS DINNER ALL BREAKS BY WEIGHT. WHAT WHAT YOU ARE DOESN'T MATTER YOUR AGE HE'S A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID WRESTLING WRESTLING NINETEEN YEAR OLD MEN? BECAUSE A THEIR SAME WEIGHT. SO I I THINK WE NEED OUT SOMETHING THAT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH BECAUSE IF YOU DO THIS PRACTICE A LONG TIME OVER TIME WE NEED TO CHARGE TRACK AND SEE WE STARTED SEEING. YOU KNOW INJURIES. KIDS PASSED OUT OVER THE YEARS RESOURCE THE DEATHS ON FOOTBALL FIELDS FOR HEAT STROKE ALL THESE THINGS ARE COME TO OUR ATTENTION. BECAUSE OUR SPORTS ARE GETTING MORE COULD EVEN YOUNGER KIDS ARE FOCUSED KNOW WHICH REPORTER GOING TO FOCUS ON AND THEY STAY IN THAT SPORT. ANYWAY I WOULD ENCOURAGE NOT ONLY JUST AT YOUR LEVEL BUT THE LEVELS DOWN THAT WE GET A SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT WE CAN TRACK AND MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE NOT DAMAGING THESE THESE KIDS IN IN MEN WOMEN OVERTIME. AND DRASTIC WEIGHT CUT IS JUST FRANKLY NOT HEALTHY IT DIG INTO IT MESSES WITH THE BODIES DRASTICALLY. AND THERE ARE SOME CRAZY PARENTS OTHER AND COACHES THAT PUSH THEIR ATHLETES IN PLACES THAT ARE NOT SAFE. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY TRACKING AND SO WE CAN WE CAN SHOW YOU SOME INFORMATION. YOU MIGHT FIND REALLY INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THE DATA WE HAVE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DATA SETS FOR YOU TO LOOK AND STUFF. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION TO RESPECTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SING THOUGH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NOW OPEN THIS BUT PORTION.

HOPEFULLY A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION FOR ALL OF YOU -- NUMBERS TO REVIEWS REALLY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY COME BEFORE YOU AND THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW PASSED THE THIS OVER TO FOR OUR NEXT ITEM. THAT THANK YOU I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LOW. I WANT TO INVITE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BUREAU OF SECURITY INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES. TO COME FORWARD. AND TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THEIR BUREAU. AND DISCUSS ISSUES RAISED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER COULD YOU UP PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF. WELCOME HERE OPENING -- COMMENTS [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. CHECK GLAZER CHAIR LOW SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND STAFF. MYNAME IS DARRELL WOO. AND I SERVE AS THE CHIEF FOR THE BUREAU SECURITY AND INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES. I'M JOINED BY TO MY RIGHT MY ENFORCEMENT CHIEF SAM'S THE DOLL SKI. AND TO MY LEFT LICENSING CHIEF GLORIA ELLA GARCIA. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE BUREAU'S HISTORY AND FUNCTIONS. THE BUREAU'S RESPONSE. THE BUREAU IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGULATION OF SEVERAL INJURED INDUSTRIES. THROUGH SIX PRACTICE AXE. THE ALARM COMPANY ACT LOCKSMITH THAT THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AT THE PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES ACT. THE PROPRIETARY SECURITY SERVICES ACT. AND THE COLLATERAL RECOVERY ACT. THE BUREAU PROVIDES OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND LICENSES REGISTRATIONS AND CERTIFICATES AND PERMITS. TO OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND LICENSEES IN INDUSTRIES WHERE PRACTITIONERS HAVE POWERS. AND RESPONSIBILITIES OVER PROPERTY AND PERSONAL SAFETY OUTSIDE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS A RESULT. PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC REMAINS THE BUREAU'S HIGHEST PRIORITY. THE BUREAU HAS AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH EXAMINES AND MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE BUREAU'S FUNCTIONS AND POLICIES. THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE CONSISTS OF SEVEN PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS AND SIX PUBLIC MEMBERS. THE BUREAU ALSO OPERATES DISCIPLINARY REVIEW COMMITTEES FOR THE ALARM COMPANY COLLATERAL RECOVERY PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR AND PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES INDUSTRIES. SINCE OUR SUNSET REVIEW IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE BUREAU HAS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED TWO THE BREEZE SYSTEM. ALONG THE BUREAU TO PROVIDE ONLINE APPLICATION PROCESSING AND FEE PAYMENTS FOR MOST LICENSES. MIGRATION TO BREEZE HAS HELPED TO BUILD THE RAW PROCESSING TIMES FOR THOSE APPLYING ONLINE. FOR NEARLY ALL OF THESE BUREAU LICENSES THE BUREAU HAS DECREASED INTERNAL PROCESSING TIME. TO IMPROVE CONSUMER SATISFACTION. THE BUREAU CONTINUES TO EXPLORE WAYS TO IMPROVE ITS EFFICIENCY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS AND CONTINUES TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSUMERS ALIKE IN LINE WITH THE BUREAU'S TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE STRATEGIC PLAN. THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED TO STATUTORY CHANGES THAT WILL ALLOW THE BUREAU TO OPERATE MORE EFFECTIVELY. FIRST THE BILL SEEKS TO INCREASE EFFICIENT OPERATIONS BY STREAMLINING LAWS RELATED TO SECURITY GUARD REGISTRANTS ANNUAL CONTINUING EDUCATION TRAINING. THE SECOND PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY BY ALIGNING CURRENT LAW RELATED TO AGE RESTRICTIONS FOR FIREARM PERMITS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS A LEGISLATURE CONSENT CONSIDERS OUR SENSE AT EXTENSION. NOW. I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMITTEES IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. FIRST ISSUE IS ISSUE NUMBER SIX WHICH RELATES TO THE TIMES AND WHY THESE WEAPONS ARE NOT SPECIFIED AS A DEADLY WEAPON. THE IMPACT WEAPONS SPECIFIED IN VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE ONLINE WITH THE LIST OF THE IMPACT WEAPONS SPECIFIED IN THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE C.. PENAL CODE SECTION TWO TWO TWO ONE ZERO AND TWO TWO TWO NINE ZERO INCLUDED IN BOTH OF THESE PENAL CODE SECTIONS IS THE TERM BILLY. AS IN BILLY CLUB AND THAT THE THE PENAL CODE PROHIBITS A PERSON FROM POSSESSING THE LISTED IMPACT WEAPONS AND PROVIDES EXEMPTIONS. FOR PEACE OFFICERS AND SECURITY GUARDS TO MEET SPECIFIED CONDITIONS. PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE TWO TWO TWO NINE FIVE SUBSECTION BE. A BUREAU REGISTERED SECURITY GUARD WHO POSSESSES A BUREAU BATON PERMIT CAN LEGALLY CARRY UP THE TIME WHILE PERFORMING OFFICIAL GUARD DUTIES. THE BUREAU HAS HAD NO DIFFICULTIES IN PERFORMING ITS REGULATORY DUTIES WE LEFT RELATIVE. TO BUREAU LICENSES AND THE USE OF A BATON [inaudible] THE BUREAU. BELIEVES THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO REVISE. THE TIME PERMITTING PROCESS IN A MANNER THAT WOULD HEIGHTEN REGULATORY OVERSIGHT ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO REVISE THE BATON PERMITTING PROCESS. POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CONSIDER INCLUDE WHO ISSUES TO BECOME PERMANENT THE POTENTIAL REFRESHER TRAINING. AND GIVEN THAT THE SAFE AND GIVEN THAT THE SAFE AND PROPER USE OF THE TIME IS A PERISHABLE SKILL. NEXT ISSUE WAS ISSUE NUMBER NINE WHICH RELATES TO PRIOR WORK HISTORY OF FORMER ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THE STEPS TO BE OLD TAKES TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. IN MY ROLE AS THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU I TAKE SERIOUSLY OUR MISSION TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER WE MUST ALSO BALANCE THE NEED TO LIMIT BARRIERS TO LICENSURE. PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE LEGISLATURE'S PASSING OF AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT LAST YEAR. UNDER THE BUREAU ALL APPLICANTS FOR LICENSURE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PROPRIETARY PRIVATE SECURITY EMPLOYERS ARE FINGERPRINTED AND BACKGROUND CHECK. PRIOR TO THE A LICENSE BEING ISSUE IT'S UNIQUE HOWEVER IN THAT MANY OF ITS LICENSES ARE FORMA LICENSEES ARE FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. IF THE ACTIONS OF A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERRESULTED IN THE CONVICTION THE BUREAU WAS RECEIVED THE CONVICTION INFORMATION AND USE THAT IN ITS FITNESS DETERMINATION FOR LICENSURE DETERMINATION. THE BUREAU DOES BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME TOOLS THAT THEY CAN USE TO PRO ACTIVELY BE AWARE OF THE INCIDENTS OF FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT. APPLICANTS POTENTIALLY THE BUREAU CAN USE THE NEWLY SIGNED LAW SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO RELEASE THE DISCIPLINARY RECORDS OF OFFICERS INVOLVED IN SHOOTINGS CRIMES OR OTHER KINDS OF MISCONDUCT. THE BILL IS AWAITING THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAW AND HOW THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CAN BE USED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY THE BUREAU'S RECENTLY ESTABLISHED FARM ASSESSMENT COULD BE USED AS ANOTHER TOOL THIS IS ASPEN IS INTENDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A SECURITY GUARD REGISTRANT. CAN DEMONSTRATE APPROPRIATE JUDGMENT RESTRAINT AND SELF CONTROL FOR THE PURPOSES OF CARRYING AND USING A FIREARM WHEN PERFORMING SECURITY GUARD DUTIES. THE BUREAU BELIEVES THAT THESE TOOLS COULD ASSIST THE BUREAU IN STRIKING THE DELICATE BALANCE OF REDUCING BARRIERS TO LICENSURE AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THE BUREAU LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEES ON THIS ISSUE. THE COMMITTEE'S NEXT THE ISSUE WAS ISSUE TEN WHICH RELATES TO FARMS AND BATON TRAINING AND WHETHER THE BUREAU SHOULD EVALUATE. THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING A FIREARMS -- BATON TRAINING INSTRUCTOR PERMIT. THE BUREAU WAS OPENED TO CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE THE VALUATION OF THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS TO RECEIVE AND MAINTAIN. A FIVE A BUREAU FARMS OR BATON TRAINING INSTRUCTOR PERMITS. PATHWAYS TO OBTAIN A BUREAU CERTIFICATION FOR EITHER A BATON OR FIREARMS TRAINING INSTRUCTOR PERMIT INVOLVED HOLDING A RESPECTIVE INSTRUCTORS CERTIFICATE FROM A FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY WHICH IS USUALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND HOLDING A COMPARABLE CERTIFICATE OR HAVING EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER ENTITIES. RESTRICTING THE TRAINING CERTIFICATES TO ONLY THOSE ISSUED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY MIGHT HELP TO ENSURE A SOUND CURRICULUM HOWEVER HE COULD ALSO RESULT IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT IN THE INSTRUCTOR POPULATION. THE BUREAU BELIEVES THE ONSITE INSPECTIONS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN EDUCATING LICENSEES. ON AND PROMOTING COMPLIANCE LOS THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE FOR TRAINING FACILITIES. EXPANDING MANDATORY INSPECTIONS TO BATON TRAINING FACILITIES WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT STAFF SO THAT THE BUREAU'S INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES WOULD NOT BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE NEW ADDITIONAL WORK WILL. THE BUREAU'S FIREARMS TRAINING MANUAL IN BATON TRAINING MANUAL PROVIDE THE CONTENT AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES THAT MUST BE COVERED IN THE RESPECT OF COURSE AS WELL AS HOW THE TRAINING MUST BE CONDUCTED. FOR EXAMPLE COMPLETE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION BEFORE RANGE INSTRUCTION FOR FIREARMS TRAINING. THE BUREAU CERTIFIED TRAINING FACILITIES AND INSTRUCTORS MUST PROVIDE THE SPECIFIED TRAINING COURSE. AND THE BILL'S REGULATORY AUTHORITY IS TO INSURE THAT THE INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING ARE BEING PROVIDED AS SPECIFIED IN IF NOT. TO TAKE APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FINALLY. ISSUE TWELVE ASKED THAT THE BUREAU SPEAK ABOUT POTENTIAL STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO BE MORE PROACTIVE REGARDING VIOLENT INCIDENTS INVOLVING. ITS LICENSEES AND IF WE CAN DO MORE TO ENSURE PUBLIC PROTECTION BY EVALUATING THESE INCIDENTS. SINCE IMPLEMENTATION OF BREEZE THE BILL HAS BEEN ABLE TO MORE ACCURATELY TRACK INCIDENT REPORTS AND REPORTED FAR I'M JUST CHARGES. SINCE SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INCIDENT REPORTS WE SEE -- HOWEVER IN IN REVIEWING THE SOURCE STATED THE BUREAU RECOGNIZE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT ORIGINALLY REPORTED IN THE BUREAU'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN SUNSET REPORT WAS INACCURATE. AND TODAY I'D LIKE TO CORRECT THAT THE INFORMATION REPORTED ABOVE IN THEIR BACKGROUND REPORT PAPER CONTAINS THE SAME INACCURATE DATA. AND WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT INFORMING THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER. THE BUREAU ORIGINALLY REPORTED THAT FROM JULY ONE TWENTY SIXTEEN TO JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE THIRTEEN FAR I'M DISCHARGED IN CITY. THEN INVOLVED AND ON TO THE SECURITY OFFICER -- UNDO THE SECURITY GUARD. THIS NUMBER REPORTEDLY ACTUALLY REFLECTS A TIME PERIOD OF JULY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN TO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOT. TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE BUREAU RECEIVED TWENTY EIGHT RELATED INCIDENT REPORTS. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN TO DATE THE BILL HAS RECEIVED FIFTEEN FAR ARE RELATED INCIDENT REPORTS. THESE NUMBERS INDICATE THAT AFTER SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX ONE INTO AFFECT THE NUMBER OF FIREARM RELATED INCIDENT REPORTS REPORTED TO THE BUREAU HAD DOUBLE. THE BILL DISCOVERS INSTANCES WHERE A LICENSEE HAS NOT REPORTED AN INCIDENT OR A FARM JUST CHARGE THE BUREAU IS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE A CITATION. TO THE LICENSEE THIS INCREASE IN REPORTING CLEARLY INDICATES THAT THE LAWS WORKING AS INTENDED. SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX AUTHORIZED THE BUREAU TO SEEK AN EMERGENCY ORDER AGAINST A FLOCK FIRE ARMS PERMIT HOLDER. IS THE BUREAU'S INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE PERMIT HOLDER PRESENTS AN UNDUE HAZARD TO PUBLIC SAFETY. SB ELEVEN NINETY SIX WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH TWENTY SIXTEEN AND BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE BUREAU HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO PROGRAM PROMULGATE REAL REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO PROPERLY UTILIZE THE EMERGENCY ORDER PROCESS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. IN THE MEANTIME SAID INSTANCES WERE LICENSEES ARRESTED. FOR AN OFFENSE THAT IS OF SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED TO THE DUTIES OR FUNCTIONS OF THE LICENSE THE BUREAU CAN AND DOES PURSUE A PENAL CODE TWENTY THREE HOLD. ON THE LICENSE. IN REGARD TO THE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ARMED GUARDS IN INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN A FIREARM INCIDENT WITH AN ARMED GUARD. THE SERVICES ARE THOSE GENERALLY ACCESSIBLE TO ANY CRIME VICTIM THROUGH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIME VICTIM PROGRAMS WHICH ARE OVERSEEN BY. THE CALIFORNIA VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM FINALLY. THE BEER RESPECTFULLY ASK THIS LEGISLATION TO EXTEND ITS SUNSET. SO CAN CONTINUE REGULATING SECURITY SERVICES LOCKSMITHS ALARMS AND REPOSITION INDUSTRIES AND IN DOING SO THE BUREAU WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ITS SERVICES. AND UP HOLD ITS MANDATE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU -- MR WILL FOR THAT -- THOROUGH REVIEW OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE STAFF REPORT AND I WANTED BUT MY COLLEAGUES -- TO HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS MEMBERS ANY ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. YES -- THE CELL NUMBER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ONE OF THE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE BREEZE SYSTEM BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN YOU TRANSITION THERE WERE SOME ISSUES THAT QUICKLY GOT IRONED OUT. BUT THERE CONTINUE TO BE SOME SORT WITH SOME TYPES OF PERMIT APPLICATIONS AND AND REGISTRATIONS THAT YOU DO NOT PROCESS THROUGH BREEZE AND SO I WONDERED IF YOU COULD. TALK TO US ABOUT YOUR REASONS FOR NOT TRANSITIONING THOSE ELEMENTS OF YOUR PROGRAM CERTAINLY. ON THAT NOTE SOME PLEASE. SO CURRENTLY -- WE DID NOT PROCESS. REPOSITION EMPLOYEES AND THE REASON WHY WE DO NOT IS BECAUSE THOSE RED -- OR HELD BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY APPLICATIONS IS NOT. THE EMPLOYEE ITSELF DOES NOT HAVE -- BREEZE CAPABILITY THEN ALSO -- WE DON'T PROVIDE -- BREEZE SERVICES FOR FIREARM PERMITS A WE HAD TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE BREEZE SYSTEM DUE. TO EXCESSIVE DEFICIENCIES I WILL KNOW TELL THAT -- IN IN THE FUTURE WE MIGHT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO EXPLORE -- FIRE ARM -- APPLICATIONS AGAIN THROUGH BREEZE NOW THAT BREEZE HAS SETTLED DOWN AND BECOMING A MORE FIRM -- PLATFORM FOR US -- TO UTILIZE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THAT. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAY EXCESSIVE DEFICIENCIES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A LIMITATION OF THE PREVIOUS PLATFORMERS A SOMETHING THAT WAS A DEFICIENCY IN THE APPLICATION THEY WERE IN THE APPLICATIONS IN THE PROCESSING? OF THE APPLICATIONS YES NO WE HAVE WE HAVE REASON WE'RE USING THE BREEZE PLATFORM AND IT IS -- EXPEDITING OUR APPLICATIONS FOR ALL OTHER AREAS THAT WERE USING IT WITH I'M SORRY I'M I'M STILL NOT FOLLOWING YOU SO THE WHEN YOU HAVE EXT EXCESSIVE DEFICIENCIES ARE YOU TALK IS A SOMETHING THAT IN THE PLATFORM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THE APPLICANT IS GETTING WRONG. IT'S IN THE FAULT OF THE APPLICANT I WOULD YOU NOT I MEAN IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PLATFORM YOU'RE HOSTING APPLICATION ON IF. YOU'RE APPLICANTS CERTAIN ARE CREATING THESE DEFICIENCIES WHY WOULD YOU NOT THE ENTRANT WISE AT A REASON NOT TO TRANSITION THAT TO BREEZE. IT WAS WE HAD IT IN BREEZE WE TOOK IT OUT TO ACCEPT HELP EXPEDITE THOSE DEFICIENCIES. AND THEN AND NOW THAT. WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN THE BREEZE FOR A WHILE WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN MIGRATED WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF MIGRATING AT THAT TO BREEZE I WANTED TO SAY -- THERE WAS A 50% ERROR RATE AND SO WERE LOOKING AT THE DEFICIENCIES MORE CLOSELY TO SEE HOW WE CAN EDUCATE THE INDUSTRY -- AND ALSO LOOKING WHEN WE GO BACK TO TRY TO AUTOMATE THIS IT WILL BE A LESSER DEFICIENCY RATE. OKAY -- YEAH I I WANNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THIS MAY WE CAN TAKE IT OFF LINE AS I'M STILL FAILING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE BREEZE PLATFORM IS CONTRIBUTING. TO THE DEFICIENCIES IN THE APPLICATIONS -- WHAT ABOUT THE TIME PERMITS SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU DON'T TRACK ON BREEZE IS THAT CORRECT? SO THE BATON PERMITS ARE ACTUALLY ISSUED BY THE BATON TRAINING FACILITIES -- WE ISSUE THOSE LICENCES TO THE BIRTH BATON FACILITIES AND THEN WHEN THE APPLICANT COMPLETE THE TRAINING. THEY ACTUALLY ISSUE TO THE LICENSEE BY THE FACILITY BASED MET A LESS TO US. AND THEN WE WILL -- UPDATE THAT IN THE OKAY SO THAT THAT'S THAT FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT YOU DON'T EXPECT THEM THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BRUCE YOU DON'T EXPECT THAT THOSE PERMITS. TO BE ISSUED THROUGH BREEZE FOR THAT REASON. AND THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE PRACTICE ACT REQUIRES US TO ISSUE THE THE TIME PERMITS ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO ME ON THAT THE FIREARMS PERMITS BECAUSE WE'RE JUST WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH A LARGER ISSUE. OF BREEZE AT HOW TO SUBMIT MOST EFFICIENTLY MAKE THAT WORK FOR ALL OF THE DC A AGENCIES THAT WANT TO USE IT. AND SO -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S A LIMITATION THE PLATFORM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. WE WILL DO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SELLING MEMBER ANY OTHER MEMBER HAVE A QUESTION. FOR THIS GROUP. ON THIS WILL CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT -- ABOUT -- AGAIN WORK HISTORY WHERE THERE'S ISSUES WITH FIREARMS -- CAN A POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS FIRED FOR INAPPROPRIATELY. IMPROPER USE OF FORCE OR FOR INAPPROPRIATELY DESTRUCTION A WEAPON BECOME LICENSED -- TO ACT AS A WEAPON WEAPON VARIANTS SECURITY GUARD CAN THAT CAN THAT HAPPEN [inaudible] TODAY [inaudible] YEAH. SAID DURING THE APPLICATION PROCESS ESPECIALLY -- FOR EITHER ACTIVE DUTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THEY APPLY. THEY SELF IDENTIFY AS BEING -- ONE FORCE IN A NOT. SO UNLESS THEY SPECIFY TO US UP FRONT THAT THEY ARE IN FACT ONE FOUR SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW -- IF THERE. IS AN INSTANCE WHERE WE FIND OUT THAT THERE WE CAN USE THAT AS PART OF OUR FITNESS FOR LICENSURE WHEN WE DO OUR REVIEW. IT SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY REACTIVE. SO HERE WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO PROBABLY. YOU KNOW HAS SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD CONTINUE TO CARRY A WEAPON AND BE LICENSED. EVEN AS A SECURITY GUARD IS THERE NOTHING MORE THAT YOU CAN DO PRO ACTIVELY. TO BE AWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE AREN'T THAT MANY IN THE STATE. SO WHY WOULD YOU BE MORE EQUIPPED. VERSUS THE YOU KNOW. RELYING UPON SELF DISCLOSURE SEEMS LIKE A VERY PASSIVE ESPECIALLY IN IN. IN A PLACE WHERE -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE S. SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUES RIGHT CARRYING A WEAPON WHEN THEY'VE HAD -- PRIOR WORK HISTORY OF AND I AND I CLEARLY AGREE WITH EACH IT IS LIMITATION OF THE TWO PROVIDED TO THE BUREAU. TODAY OF PARTICULARLY BECAUSE APPLICANTS SELF REPORT. AND SO -- WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO SEE HOW WE MAKE STRENGTH. OUR ARTICULATED MOVING FOR GREAT GOOD TO HEAR I I IT'S IT'S ANOTHER PLACE THAT -- IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT THAT. WE CAN'T DO MORE I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH STAFF -- TO TO LOOK AT THAT AND WE APPRECIATE MOVING FORWARD IN WORKING WITH STAFF AS WELL ARE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS OF NOT AN OPEN UP TO A PUBLIC COMMENT. ALL RIGHT -- IF THERE'S ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THIS REVIEW PLEASE -- STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE. THEY WILL. CHECK JUST MORNING CHAIRMAN OF AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID CHANDLER I'M THE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LICENSE SECURITY AGENCIES GARCIA ASSOCIATES. AND OUR MEMBERS REPRESENT OVER FIFTY THOUSAND LICENSEES IN CALIFORNIA. I LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE WE DO MAINTAIN AND WHAT I FEEL TO BE AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR REGULATOR. WE CONTINUALLY MEET WITH OUR REGULAR THEY'RE KIND ENOUGH TO MEET WITH US TO GO OVER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN THE INDUSTRY -- MISRULE HIS ENTIRE STAFF THE CHIEFS HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN TO LISTEN TO OUR ISSUES OF COURSE OUR MAIN ISSUE IS PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK -- WHICH IS A VITAL PART OF KEEPING THE ECONOMY MOVING IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB IN LOWERING THE TIME FRAMES TO GET OUR LICENSE LICENSED -- BUT AS WE WILLAGREE WITH YOU -- WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE TO CARRY FIREARMS ALSO SO WE WORK WITH THE BUREAU TO HELP THEM OUT ANYWAY WE CAN TRY TO EDUCATE OUR MEMBERS ALSO. SHOWN CLOSE AND JUST WANNA SAY THAT WE DO. WORK CLOSELY WITH THE BOROUGH BUREAU AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE -- TO ENCOURAGE THE OF THE COMMITTEE TO EXTEND THE SUNSET THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS RANDY KEHLER I'M A PAST PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LICENSED INVESTIGATORS AND THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS CHAIR. IT. KELLY ARE THE CALIFORNIA LICENSE VEST HERE'S WAS ORGANIZED OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO IT HAS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE SUPPORT ALSO BE S. I. S. WE'VE SPENT MANY HOURS TALKING TO THEM AND WORKING OUT OUR ISSUES WITH THEM AND WE WOULD LIKE THOSE SUNSET REVIEW. OF BE CONSIDERED AN AND THE BUREAU KEEP TO KEEP OPERATING. UP WE CHOOSE A WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED THESE WITH THE BUREAU SO THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE -- DISCUSSED WITH THE STAFF AS WELL THE SENATE COMMITTEE. THE FIRST ISSUE IS LICENSE LOOKUP. OF THE BREEZE PROGRAM ISSUES CAME UP A FEW MINUTES AGO AND PRIOR TO THE AND IMPLEMENTED. PATIENT OF THE BREEZE PROGRAM. OF A LICENSEE COULD BE LOOKED AT BY THEIR PERSONAL NAME. TODAY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. ARE YOU CAN LOOK UP THE THE MY UNDERSTANDING AS BECAUSE PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS ARE. THERE AGENCY IS LICENSED AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL NAME LICENSED. THAT THAT WAS ELIMINATED IN THE PRE SYSTEM IT'S A PROBLEM IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM FOR US IT'S A CONSUMER PROTECTION PROBLEM FOR US. IF OF IF I HAVE AN ATTORNEY THAT IS -- WANTS TO HIRE ME AND ALL HE KNOWS IS MY NAME. THEN HE WOULD. THINK I WAS COMMITTING FRAUD BECAUSE HE'S LIKE ON ME NORMALLY AND ATTORNEY WOULD NOT KNOW MY BUSINESS NAME IS SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WOULD ONLY KNOW ME. BY MY BY PERSONAL NAME SO THAT HAS BECOME A SERIOUS. CONSUMER PURPLE PROTECTION PROBLEM FOR US AS WELL AS IF THERE'S UNLICENSED AT OUR ASSOCIATION DOES OUR OWN UNLICENSED ACTIVITIES INVESTIGATION BEFORE IT GETS REFERRED TO THE BUREAU. AND WE CANNOT LOOK THEM UP BY THEIR PERSONAL NAME. THAT THE PROBLEM TO THE SECOND IS -- THE ENHANCED IDENTIFICATION CARD. SO CURRENTLY WE GET A PAPER CARD PAPER A PIECE OF PAPER ACTUALLY. WITH OUR LICENSE NUMBER AND EXPIRATION DATE. THEN AS AN OPTION WE CAN GO -- TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING SERVICES AND GET AN ENHANCED ID WITH A PHOTOGRAPH HARD. CARD. BUT THERE'S NO EXPIRATION DATE. SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO CARRY TWO CARDS WE WANT TO HAVE A AYE UP PHOTO ID AND EXPIRATION DATE WE HAVE TO HAVE TWO CARDS. WE WOULD LIKE THOSE MERGED INTO ONE ONE HARD CARD THAT WOULD HAVE OUR PHOTO ON IT -- THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN USES THE DMB LICENSE NOT THAT SOPHISTICATED DOESN'T NEED HOLOGRAMS AND ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT A PHOTO ID CARD WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE AND OUR NAME WOULD BE. OF SUPER SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM -- I'VE GOT A COUPLE MORE ISSUES I'M SORRY I'M TAKING SO MUCH TIME OF THE NEXT ITEM IS UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR SIXTY FIFTH OF SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY POINT ONE OF THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR ACT AS PROVIDED A PENALTY FOR ENGAGE IN A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WITHOUT A LICENSE. AS AS AN INFRACTION. ANNA PUNISHABLE BY BY FIND OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PROVISION IN THE ACT. SECTION SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY THREE OF THE BNP CODE THAT SPECIFIES THAT IS A MISDEMEANOR TO REPRESENT. USE A LETTER HEADER ADVERTISE ONESELF AS A LICENSEE SO IN ORDER TO CONFORM THOSE TWO ISSUES WE LIKE THEM BOTH THE SAME MISDEMEANOR -- AND IT DOES PRESENT A SERIOUS RISKS TO THE CONSUMER. WE WE ACTUALLY HAVE VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION. THIS CONSUMER IS AT RISK IF THEY'RE DEALING WITH SOMEBODY AT I'M LICENSE THAT HAS NO OVERSIGHT BY B. S. I. S.. SO WE HIGHLY ENCOURAGE THAT TO CHANGE AND HAVE MISDEMEANORS IN BOTH AREAS. THE LAST OF THE NEXT ITEM IS THE VS I. S. BUDGET BE ADJUSTMENTS AND FUND MERGERS. OUR BOARD HAS NOT ADDRESS THAT YET ARE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION'S BOARD IS NOT ADDRESS THAT YET IT'S BEING PRESENTED TO THEM NEXT SUNDAY. HOWEVER -- WE DO WE DO SUPPORT IT AND THAT FEES INCREASES ARE NECESSARY WE HAVEN'T HAD A FEE INCREASE SINCE THE NINETIES WE REALIZE THAT IT. IT TAKES MONEY TO OPERATE THE B. S. I. S. BUDGET BUT WE HAVE SOME ISSUES AND HOPE THAT MAYBE INCREASED REVENUE WILL ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE WAS A P. I.. EMAIL PUT IN PLACE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS A P. EYES BECAUSE THE PHONES WERE OVERLOADED. AND THAT WORKED VERY EFFECTIVELY FOR AWHILE BUT IT'S LOST MOMENTUM IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. P. EYES AREN'T ABLE TO GET THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND TIMELY MANNER THERE ARE ABLE TO GET SOLUTIONS TO THEIR PROBLEMS AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE. A BETTER ACCESS TO THE BUREAU TO GET THOSE THINGS TAKEN CARE OF IF I COULD ASK YOU TO SUM UP. YES AND SO IN SOME RATED BY THE WAY YOU'RE VERY WELCOME TO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS THANK OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE YOU'RE FOCUSED ON THE GOOD WORK THAT. ARE THE WORK THAT THIS THIS BUREAU DOES AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ALL THAT INTO ACCOUNT. WELL I JUST LIKE TO SUM UP WITH SAME WITH WE'D LOVE TO WORK WITH THE BUREAU TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES.

MY NAME IS GEORGE FAMILY AT ON THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY OFTEN REFERRED TO IS TO CVA. I'M CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT AND A PARTNER AT PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS IN SILICON VALLEY. ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD MEMBERS AND OUR STAFF IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY. TO DISCUSS THE OR SUNSET REVIEW. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A VALUABLE PROCESS TO HELP INSURE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY CONTINUES TO PLAY. AND STAY FOCUSED ON ITS MISSION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT MISSION GUIDES ALL THAT WE DO. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF OUR BOARD IS OUR VICE PRESIDENT MARC SILVERMAN. IN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAD A DOLLARS. FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS ENTRUSTED CALIFORNIA BOARD OF COUNTY WITH PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTANCY IN CALIFORNIA. OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS BY ENSURING ONLY QUALIFIED LICENSEES PRACTICE PUBLIC ACCOUNTANCY IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS. OUR BOARD REGULATES OVER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND LICENSEES INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS AND ACCOUNTING FIRMS. MANY OF THE ACCOUNTING FIRMS. THAT THE BOARD REGULATES HAVE NATIONAL WORLDWIDE FOOT PRINTS CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS WERE CPA'S WORK IN A WIDE RANGE. OF SETTINGS INCLUDING ACCOUNTING FIRMS PRICE GOVERNMENT ACADEMIA. CPA'S PROVIDE SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND EMPLOYERS OF ALL SIZES AND NEEDS. THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY RECOGNIZE THE SCOPE OF ITS REGULATORY INFLUENCE WITH STAKEHOLDERS RANGING FROM CONSUMERS NEEDING ACCOUNTING SERVICES LENDERS SHAREHOLDERS AND INVESTORS. THAT RELY ON SERVICES RENDERED BY CPA'S. AND BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL THAT YOU CPA'S TO ESTABLISH INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC -- SHAPES POLICIES REGULATION ENFORCEMENT DECISIONS REACH BY OUR AGENCY. THIS CONCLUDES OUR OPENING REMARKS ABOUT THE MISSION AND SCOPE OF THE CBA. AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION SENATOR GLAZER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW WE WILL TRANSITION TO THE TO DISCUSSING FOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED THE BACKGROUND PAPER PREPARED BY COMMITTEE STAFF. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU PRESIDENT FAMILY AT IT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS MARC SILVERMAN AND I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY. I AM PLEASED TO DISCUSS ISSUE NUMBER ONE RELATED TO THE CBA'S REQUEST TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT ALLOWED BY STATUTE THAT THE BOARD MAY CHARGE FOR ITS LICENSE RENEWAL. IN INITIAL PERMIT FEES. TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THE CBA MAY PURSUE FUTURE NECESSARY FEE INCREASES. THE CBA REQUESTS THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AN INCREASE TO THE STATUTORY MAXIMUM AMOUNT FOR IT'S LICENSE RENEWAL AN INITIAL PERMIT FEES FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE PRESENT STATUTORY MAXIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS HAS EXISTS STOOD FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY YEARS AND WE BELIEVE THIS INCREASED TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WOULD ALLOW SUFFICIENT. FUTURE GROWTH AND FEES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. TO ADD SOME BACKGROUND ON THIS MATTER DURING THE CBA SUNSET REVIEW IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE EXPRESSED CONCERN WHETHER THE CBA WOULD BE CAPABLE. FROM BOTH THE FUNDING AND STAFFING OF OF INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING THE CASE AGAINST A LARGE ACCOUNTANCY FIRM. FURTHER THE LEGISLATURE INDICATED THAT TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR POSSIBLE ENFORCEMENT NEEDS IT SUPPORTS THE CBA MAINTAINING A TWENTY FOUR MONTH SPENDING RESERVE. IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CBA RECEIVED REPAYMENT OF LOANS PREVIOUSLY MADE TO THE GENERAL FUND WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED ITS RESERVE. HOWEVER THE CBA'S AUTHORIZED EXPENDITURES CURRENTLY EXCEED ITS REVENUES AND IT'S DRAWING DOWN THAT RESERVE. THE CBA ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL HAVE A RESERVE A PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MONTHS OF OPERATING EXPENSES AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. TO ADDRESS THIS IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE BOARD APPROVED A FEE INCREASE THROUGH REGULATIONS TO BALANCE ITS REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. IF APPROVED THIS PROPOSED RULEMAKING WOULD PLACE OUR LICENSE RENEWAL AND INITIAL PERMIT FEES AT THE STATUTORY MAXIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. WE EXPECT THIS FEE INCREASE TO TAKE PLACE IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY MEMBERS -- THE REQUEST BEFORE YOU WOULD ONLY IMPACT THE MAXIMUM FEE THAT MAY BE CHARGED AS WITH ALL pCHANGES TO ITS FEES THE BOARD WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED. TO ENGAGE IN THE RULE MAKING PROCESS TO DETERMINE IN SET THE ACTUAL FEE AMOUNTS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT GOVERNS THE RULE MAKING PROCESS AND REQUIRES AN AGENCY TO AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISH THE NECESSITY OF ANY PROPOSED RULE MAKING. THIS LAW REQUIRES THE CBA TO SHOW WHAT CLEAR NEED AND JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS PROPOSED FEES. FURTHER THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE REQUIRES THE CBA TO LOWER ITS FEES IF IT HAS MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF FUNDING IN ITS RESERVE. THESE TWO AREAS OF LAW PREVENTIVE IT'S FEES BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED TO FUND ITS OPERATING EXPENSES AND MAINTAIN A PRUDENT RESERVE. THANK YOU MEMBERS AT THIS TIME ALL TURN THE PRESENTATION OVER TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER MISS PATTY BOWERS TO DISCUSS ISSUE NUMBER TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VICE PRESIDENT SILVERMAN AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME IS PATTY POWERS AND I'VE HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING AS THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY IS EXECUTIVE OFFICER. SINCE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE BOARD IS SEEKING AMENDMENTS TO ITS PRACTICE FACT TO ALLOW IT TO CONSIDER. CERTAIN PAST ACTIONS AS GROUNDS FOR DENIAL OF AN APPLICATION FOR CPA LICENSE. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH RE CAST HOW MOST BOARDS AND BUREAUS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. EVALUATE PRIOR CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS OR UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OF THOSE WHO APPLY FOR AN INITIAL LIKE SINCE. AB ONE AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT WAS SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND TAKES EFFECT JULY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE BOARD BELIEVES IT IS A COMMENDABLE GOAL TO ASSIST APPLICANTS WHO HAVE A CRIMINAL HISTORY. TO OBTAIN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT AND TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDERS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING BOARDS EVALUATE PAST CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE SOME PROVISIONS OF THE BILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. THEREFORE THE BOARD HAS REQUESTED TO KEY CHANGES. FIRST WE REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE REINSTATE THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO DENY AN APPLICATION FOR LICENSURE IF THAT APPLICANT HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR DISCIPLINE. BY FEDERAL REGULATORS OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS SECOND WE ARE SEEKING EXPANDED AUTHORITY TO DENY AN APPLICATION FOR LICENSURE IF THE APPLICANT HAS COMMITTED FINANCIAL CRIMES. REGARDING ACTIONS BY FEDERAL FEDERAL REGULATORS WE ROUTINELY MONITORED ANY DISCIPLINE IMPOSED BY THESE ENTITIES AS CPA'S MAY PRACTICE BEFORE FEDERAL BODY. IN PARTICULAR TO NOTABLE FOR ARE THE U. S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. CPA'S MUST REGISTER TO PRACTICE BEFORE THESE BODIES WHICH ARE AUTHORIZED TO DISCIPLINE A CPA FOR UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT INCLUDING ACTS SUCH AS INSIDER TRADING. FRAUD AND FILING FALSE FINANCIAL INFORMATION. WE SIMILARLY CONSIDER DISCIPLINE IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO BE RELEVANT WHEN CONSIDERING AN APPLICATION FOR LICENSURE. AS WE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE THE US FURTHER IF ONE OF THE BOARDS CURRENT LICENSEES IS DISCIPLINE BY A FEDERAL REGULATOR OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. WE WOULD REVIEW THAT ACTION TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER DISCIPLINE BY THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY IS WARRANTED. THE BOARD ALSO REQUEST A CHANGE IN THE AUTHORITY GRANTED BY AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT TO DENY AN APPLICATION FOR LICENSURE IF THAT APPLICANT COMMITTED A FINANCIAL CRIME. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT DIRECTS THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY TO CONDUCT A RULE MAKING HER RELATED TO FINANCIAL CRIMES THAT ARE DIRECTLY AND ADVERSELY RELATED. TO THE FIDUCIARY QUALIFICATIONS FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF A CPA. THE BOARD REQUEST THE TERM FIDUCIARY BE REMOVED BECAUSE MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES A CPA PERFORMANCE FOR A CLIENT OR AN EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE A FIDUCIARY COMPONENT. FOR EXAMPLE CPA'S TO PERFORM TAX PREPARATION AND AUDIT SERVICES DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY OR RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR CLIENTS. REMOVAL OF THE FIDUCIARY QUALIFIER WILL ENSURE THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY IS ABLE TO CONSIDER THE FULL RANGE OF FINANCIAL CRIMES THAT ARE DIRECTLY AND ADVERSELY RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTANCY. AS DESCRIBED IN OUR SUNSET REPORT OR BOARD PREVIOUSLY REQUESTED REMOVAL OF THE TERM DIRECTLY AND ADVERSELY FROM THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RELATED TO FINANCIAL CRIMES. SINCE PUBLISHING A REPORT I AM PLEASED TO SHARE THAT BOARD STAFF HAVE HAD PRODUCTIVE AND POSITIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF FROM THE TO COMMITTEES. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE OFFICE ON A REQUESTED AMENDMENTS. AT THIS POINT BOARD STAFF NO LONGER BELIEVE IT NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE PHRASE DIRECTLY AND INVERSELY RELATED. STAFF WILL BRING THIS RECOMMENDATION TAR BOARD FOR ITS CONSIDERATION. AT OUR NEXT MEETING SCHEDULED FOR MARCH TWENTY FIRST. THE CBA APPRECIATE THE TIME HALF FROM BOTH COMMITTEES AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE OFFICE TO WORK THROUGH OUR REQUEST RELATED TO AB. TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT UNLESS THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME ALL TURN THE PRESENTATION BACK TO PRESIDENT CAMELOT TO DISCUSSION ISSUE NUMBER THREE RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECT. ALL INTERNAL PROCESSES FOR LICENSING ENFORCEMENT OF ITS AUTOMATED FUNCTIONS ARE AT IN ITS AUTOMATED FUNCTIONS ARE FEW IN LIMITED. THE CBA USES DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS -- DATABASE SYSTEM IN SEVERAL INTERNAL STAND BY LEGACY DATABASES AS WORK AROUNDS TO ADDRESS WORKLOAD DEMANDS. AS NOTED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. THE CBA WAS SLATED FOR THE BREEZE RELEASE THREE BUT NOW WE pARE IN FOR PULMONARY PLANNING PROCESS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON A BUSINESS MOTORIZATION PROJECT. BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECT HAS THE SAME GOALS BREEZE WHICH IS TO CREATE. AN TRANSITION TO A SINGLE ENFORCEMENT. AND LICENSING DATABASE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES INTERNAL ON A MISSION AND ONLINE CAPABILITIES FOR STAKEHOLDERS. IN JULY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE EXPECT TO BEGIN THE PROCESS TO FORMALLY IDENTIFY OUR BUSINESS NEEDS FOR THIS NEW SYSTEM. WHILE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROJECT IS UNDERWAY TO CVA IS ALREADY BEGIN TO PROACTIVELY DEVELOP AND FROM STEPS. IN SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS TO HELP IMPROVE SERVICES TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS. PRESENTLY THE CBA IS EXPLORING INCREASED AUTOMATED SERVICES TO IMPROVE THE PROCESSING TIME FRAMES FOR APPLICATIONS THESE INCLUDE. INCREASED ABILITY TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY. OPPORTUNITY FOR APPLICANTS TOOK PAINS OF STATUS INFORMATION OF THE APPLICATION ELECTRONICALLY. IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS. IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE LICENSEES TO PAY THE RENEWAL FEES THE ONLINE PORTAL WITH A CREDIT CARD AND SUBMIT A RENEWAL APPLICATION AND RELATED. A PAPERWORK VIA EMAIL. BY SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE CBO EXPECTS TO IMPLEMENT AN ONLINE APPLICATION FOR INITIAL LICENSURE. THIS WOULD INCLUDE EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS THAT INFORM APPLICANTS OF THE STATUS OF YOUR APPLICATION AS IT MOVES THROUGH EACH STAGE OF THE PROCESS. ALTHOUGH THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECT IS A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM COMPLETION MEMBERS WE ARE MAKING THE MOST OF OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES SO WE CAN ENHANCE THE SERVICES WE OFFER. TORO APPLICANTS IN OUR LICENSEES. WITH. WITH US TODAY IN THE AUDIENCE IS JASON PICONE. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AT THE DCA. MR BECOME IS AVAILABLE. TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE ABOUT THE REASON DEVELOPMENT AT THE C. B. A.'S SMART BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECT. UNLESS THE MET MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I WILL TURN PRESENTATION BACKED REJECTED OF OFFICER PATTI BOWERS WHO WILL DISCUSS ISSUE NUMBER SIX RELATED TO REQUESTING. A REQUEST FOR PERMANENT STAFFING. THANK YOU PRESIDENT CAMELOT. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE SIX ISSUE RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND PAPER RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY IS NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PERMANENT STAFF. THE CBA WILL BE WORKING TO THE APPROPRIATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN ITS EFFORTS TO SECURE APPROVAL FOR A STAFFING AUGMENTATION INCLUDED WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. THE BUDGET REQUEST SEEKS TO ADD PERMANENT STAFFING RESOURCES FOR OUR ENFORCEMENT LICENSING PROGRAMS AND REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON TEMPORARY HELP. THE BUDGET REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE WORK ON THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECT DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT CAMELOT. OUR BOARD WORKS DILIGENTLY TO ENSURE WE HAVE APPROPRIATE STAFFING LEVELS AND RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MEET ITS CONSUMER PROTECTION MISSION AND ARE STAKEHOLDER OBLIGATIONS ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF PERMANENT STAFF HAVE FLOOD HAS FLUCTUATED IN RECENT YEARS. THE BOARD IS PRESENTLY OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME NUMBER OF PERMANENT EMPLOYEES AS IT DID IN FISCAL YEAR. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD THE BOARD'S LICENSING POPULATION HAS INCREASED BY 20%. TO ADDRESSED INCREASED WORKLOAD IN THE ABSENCE OF PERMANENT STAFF. THE BOARD HAS EMPLOYED TEMPORARY HELP. THESE EMPLOYEES OFTEN CONSIST OF CLARK'S INTERMITTENT POSITIONS AND LIMITED TERM STAFF. ON AVERAGE THE BOARD EMPLOYEES EIGHTEEN TEMPORARY STAFF EACH YEAR. THERE IS A HIGH TURNOVER IN THESE POSITIONS AS TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES OFTEN SEEK PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT. IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE BOARD EXPERIENCED A 44% TURNOVER RATE IN ITS TEMPORARY HELP. WITH THIS RATE GROWING 253% IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ASTHOSE TRANSITIONS OCCUR THE BOARD SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME ON THE RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING OF NEW TEMPORARY STAFF. THIS CONTINUAL TRANSITION HAS LED TO INCREASED PROCESSING TIME FRAMES BACKLOGS OF WORK AND HAVING TO RELY ON STAFF WORKING WEEKENDS IN THE EVENINGS AND ON I'M. EXCUSE ME WORKING OVERTIME IN THE EVENINGS AND ON WEEKENDS WE BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE AND FISCAL REESE THIS COOLEY RESPONSIBLE FOR PERMANENT ONGOING WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY PERMANENT STAFF.

AND PLEASE NOTE ALSO THAT WE WENT SIX YEARS BEFORE IMPLEMENTING IN ASKING FOR A FEE INCREASE WHICH WE RECEIVED IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN SUPPORTING THAT. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FEE INCREASE WAS PROJECTED TO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. ANNUALLY TO ENSURE OUR BUDGET REMAINS BALANCED. IN ADDITION WE'VE SEEN AN 11% INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS JUST SINCE OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAVE WITH YOUR CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE ARE ON PACE TO EXCEED OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS FOR THE YEAR.

THE BOARD CONTINUES TO BE FISCALLY PRUDENT WITH ITS RESOURCES AND STAFF PROVIDES BUDGETARY UPDATES AT EVERY MEETING. FINALLY ALTHOUGH WE DON'T TEND TO RAISE FEES AT THIS TIME IF WE DO HAVE AN UNFORESEEN INCREASING COST WE CAN ADDRESS THEM BY RAISING FEES TO THE STATUTORY MAXIMUM. SO WE STILL HAVE SOME ROOM THERE. MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT DIEM FORCE MY PRIORITIES -- FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION PUBLIC PROTECTION EXCUSE ME FOR CONSUMER AND PUBLIC PROTECTION. ALLOCATING CSO BEES ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE LICENSE VERSUS UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS IS AN ONGOING BALANCING ACT. ACTIVITIES INCLUDE REACTIVE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS WHICH INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS COMING IN FROM THE PUBLIC. AND PROACTIVE ENFORCEMENT WHICH INVOLVES SUITES OF ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS SITES AN UNDERCOVER STINGS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSE LOS. TO MAXIMIZE CONSUMER PROTECTION THE MAJORITY OF OUR FORCE MEANT TO DIVISION STAFF ARE CHARGED WITH HANDLING MEDIATING AND INVESTIGATING CONSUMER CONSTRUCTION COMPLAINTS. AS STATED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND INVESTIGATIONS WERE CONDUCTED LAST YEAR. ULTIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF WHICH WERE INITIATED BY CONSUMERS. OF THOSE. COMPLAINTS ABOUT 70% OF THE COMPLAINTS WERE AGAINST LICENSE CONTRACTORS VERSUS 30% AGAINST UNLICENSED. WE BELIEVE OUR CURRENT ALLOCATION OF ENFORCEMENT RE GO FOR IT AND WE ANNUALLY REVIEW OUR ENFORCEMENT PRIORITY MATRIX ESTABLISHED IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO PRIORITIZE AND ENSURE THAT WERE INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS THAT INVOLVE EITHER IMMEDIATE THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OR WIDESPREAD VICTIMIZATION OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND THE LAST ONE IS ON WORKFORCE INTO DISASTER RESPONSE -- THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER -- NINE IN YOUR REPORT. WE TAKE DISASTER RESPONSE SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S WHY WE CROSS TRAIN OUR STAFF TO ENSURE WE CAN QUICKLY. THEM PROPERLY RE DIRECT OUR RESOURCES IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. WE HAVE BEEN PROACTIVE IN RESPONDING TO THE DISASTROUS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY HELP IN EDUCATE SURVIVORS WHO NEED TO HIRE SOMEONE TO REPAIR OR REBUILD THEIR HOMES. YES O. B. AS POSTED HUNDREDS OF DISASTER WARNING SIDES IN DISASTER STONE'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING BUTTE LAKE LOS ANGELES MENDOCINO NAPA. ORANGE SAN DIEGO SANTA BARBARA SHASTA CINEMA AND MATURE COUNTIES. WE'VE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS REBUILDING WORKSHOPS FOR SURVIVORS AND CONTRACTORS LOOKING FOR WORK IN THOSE AREAS AND IT MADE OTHER EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THE ASSISTANCE CENTERS. AND OTHER LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS FAR AS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS YES I'LL BE A SERVED AS A CONDUIT FOR THE INDUSTRY TO HELP FUND THE EDUCATION OF THE NEXT CONSTRUCTION LEADERS. OUR TEAM OVERSEES THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT EDUCATION SPONSORSHIP ACT WHICH FUNDS FROM GRANTS TO UNIVERSITY CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENTS. IN DOING SO WE HAVE DISPERSED OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO SEVEN DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TWO IN ADDITION WE HAVE EXCELLENT GOVERNMENT COMMUNITY AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT HELP US ADDRESS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CONCERNS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED PARTNERSHIPS WITH DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS. BUILDING OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE LABORS UNION AND OTHER CRAFT TRADE UNIONS AND THE NORTH COAST BUILDING BUILDERS EXCHANGE JUST TO NAME A FEW. BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'VE HELD MONTHLY LICENSING WORKSHOPS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS SEEKING LICENSURE. IT IS SOLD WE HAVE HELD FORTY FOR THOSE WORKSHOPS SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT INTO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX PEOPLE ATTENDED. IN THE PAST WE'VE ALSO PARTNERED WITH SEVERAL DAY LABOR CENTERS AND THE MEXICAN CONSULATE TO PRESENT THE SAME INFORMATION TO POTENTIAL APPLICANTS. MOVING FORWARD WE PLAN TO EXPAND THESE APPLICANT WORKSHOPS BY INCLUDING PRESENTERS FROM DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS AND THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. INCREASE IN LICENSE CONTRACTORS AVAILABLE TO THE SURE COMPLIANCE WITH EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ADDITION WE SOUGHT OUT NON GOVERNMENTAL THEN USED TO HOLD WORKSHOPS LABOR UNIONS KINDLY OFFERED THEIR LOCATIONS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. IN THIS EFFORT. AS A WAY TO ENCOURAGE MORE PARTICIPATION IS WORKSHOPS ENFORCEMENT STAFF COMMUNICATE WORKSHOP DETAILS TO UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS THEY MEET. WILL CONTINUE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIALS TO HAND OUT MATERIALS AND I'M PERMITTED CONSTRUCTION SITES WHERE STAFF SUSPECT UNLICENSED CONTRACT WORKERS OCCURRING. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR PREPARED REMARKS. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND TWO YOU -- MISTER ALBANY'S AND MISS RICHARDSON THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE -- ON OUR COMMISSIONS -- MEMBERS OTHER QUESTIONS. GERMAN Là IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I I'D HEARD A NUMBER OF COUNTY TO WHICH IS SITTING COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE REPRESENT MANY OF THOSE COUNTIES AS WELL. IN THE REPORT YOU REFER TO RECIPROCITY AS WELL WITH RESPECT TO OTHER STATES AND WE WAIVER OF EXAMINATIONS HAVE YOU SEEN THAT UTILIZATION WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE DISASTERS AT ALL. YES WE WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE CONTRACTORS LICENSING AGENCIES AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY. HELPFUL TO US IN ENCOURAGING CONTRACTORS FROM OTHER STATES TO COME IN AND PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CAN OUR CONSUMERS AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE WHEN WE HAD A SHORTAGE OF WELL DRILLERS. WE WERE ABLE TO SEND A BULLETIN OUT THROUGH THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO OTHER STATES ENCOURAGE CONTRACTORS TO COME THEN. THEY WOULD HAVE TO OBTAIN A LICENSE IN MOST CASES INCOME BUT THEY CAN THEN CONTRACT RASO EXPLORING RECIPROCITY AGREEMENTS OR EXAM WAIVER AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER STATES. MOST RECENTLY WE'VE ENTERED INTO AN EXAM WAIVER AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE OF LOUISIANA FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL GENERAL BUILDERS CONTRACTORS EXAM. AND SO THEY TEND ASSUME IS THEN IT SHOULD THERE BE A SHORTAGE OF WORK FORCE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS COME INTO THE STATE AND VICE VERSA ABSOLUTELY AND I WOULD ADD ONE EMPHASIZE WE DO PRIORITIZE THOSE APPLICATIONS SO WHILE IT MAY BE A STATE THAT WE HAVE AN EXAM WAIVER AGREEMENT WITH LIKE NEVADA ARIZONA UTAH. EVEN IF IT'S ANOTHER STATE WE STILL PRIORITIZE THAT IT THAT APPLICATION -- WE PROVIDE THEM ASSISTANCE IN PREPARING TO TAKE THE EXAM IF THEY NEED TO OR THEY CAN BECOME LICENSED BY HAVING A QUALIFIER ON THE LICENSE SOMEBODY IS ALREADY LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. BUT YES WE ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGE OUT OF STATE CONTRACTORS COMING TO MEET THE NEEDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU MENTIONED -- THE DISASTERS THAT HAVE FALLEN OUR STATE FOR THE LAST YEAR TO AND CERTAINLYIT'S AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN TO US AND I KNOW TO YOU -- CAN YOU AT THAT ADDRESS A COUPLE ISSUES THERE I MEAN YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'VE BEEN ACTIVE IN POSTING NOTICES -- IN THE AFFECTED AREAS. BUT WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH IN THIS IN THESE AREAS. YES IF I MAY. UM WE'VE DEVELOPED A A A VERY -- QUICK RESPONSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THEY HAVE DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CLAIMS ADJUSTERS THAT COME INTO THE AREAS THEY ARE ALSO FULL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SO WHAT. HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A DISASTER AS WE ARE MERELY CONTACTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT MINISTRY OF SIR MERGES HE SERVICES. AD WITH THEM WE STAFF THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS A DISASTER RECOVERY CENTER SO THAT WE HAVE OUR PRESENCE RIGHT AWAY ONCE YOU'RE ABLE TO GET INTO THE AREA WE PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO POST ARE SIGNS -- TO BE LOOKING FOR UNSCRUPULOUS AND OFTEN CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR WITHIN THOSE AREAS WE ALSO WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE BUILDERS EXCHANGE U. S. MEMBERS TO MOST OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DISASTER AREAS. AND WHILE THAT'SIMPORTANT THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY CONTRACTORS OR I WANT TO SEE NOT NESTLE COUNTRIES BUT UNLICENSED INDIVIDUAL SORT OF COME INTO TO HARM CONSUMERS. SO IT'S ALL ABOUT HAVING THAT OUR REACH IT'S ABOUT HAVING A PRESENCE TO CONDUCTING SWEEP OPERATIONS AND THEY'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO CONDUCT UNDERCOVER STING OPERATIONS. AT WE NOT TOO LONG AGO DID AT A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH -- THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR MARIN COUNTY I THINK THAT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED SO IT'S A COORDINATED EFFORT SO I JUST CONTRACTORS BOARDS WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. SO THAT THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT AND I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND -- YOU KNOW EFFECTIVENESS SO BEING PRESENCE PARTNERING COMMUNICATIONS ALL GOOD THINGS BUT HOW DO WE ASSESS YOUR EFFECTIVENESS IN TRYING TO MINIMIZE. FRY PARTICULAR THESE CASES OF DISASTER HOW CAN WE ASSESS THAT HOW HOW DO YOU ASSESS IT WELL THE FIRST WAY WE WOULD ASSESS THAT IS THAT WE GO BACK TO THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE AND WE THAT WAS IN THE EIGHTIES. NINETY FOUR EIGHTY NINE FOR A FOR THE AMOUNT OF EIGHTY FOUR YEAH. SO IN THE NURSERY AND ARE THERE HAVE. NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS TYPE OF AN APPROACH I WAS THAT TIME WORKING FOR THE CONTRACTORS POOR WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF APPROACH. AND WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS A WE RECEIVED A SO MANY CONSUMER COMPLAINTS SO WE HAD TO OPEN A BRANCH OFFICE TO HANDLE THEM ALL. THE COMPLAINTS FILED BY CONSUMERS WERE OVERWHELMING AND THAT'S WHEN WE REALIZED THAT WHEN THERE IS A DISASTER WE NEED TO HAVE MORE OF A PREVENTIVE APPROACH WE NEED TO BE OUT THERE PUTTING THE INFORMATION OUT. JUST HELPING IS CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY NEED TO THEY NEED TO TAKE TIME AND SELECTING THE CONTRACT NOT RUSH INTO SOMETHING SO WHAT WE FIRST LOOK AT US. FOR BEING SUCCESSFUL IN LARGE PART IS IN TO US SAYING THEY'VE BEEN FINANCIALLY HARM THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S ALSO WORKING WITH THE BUILDING DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE THE CONTRACTORS OBTAINING THE PERMITS ARE APPROPRIATELY LICENSED IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE THEIR SIZE THEIR SIGNS TO IDENTIFY UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BILL IN APARTMENT ONE WOULD BE AN OWNER BUILDER PERMIT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE A PERMANENT WORK. AND THEN FROM OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT ARE OBTAINING THESE ARE TRYING TO OBTAIN THESE CONTRACTS ARE THEY REPORTING THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CONTRACTORS ARE LOSING A TO AN UNLICENSED PERSON. BUT THE NUMBER ONE THING IS HEARING FROM THE CONSUMERS WHO WE SERVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING VICTIMIZED IN COMING TO US WITH THESE COMPLAINTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST FEW YEARS. BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN A PROACTIVE APPROACH. WELL THAT THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR -- AND I'M CERTAINLY AM ENCOURAGED BY YOUR OPTIMISM. THAT TACK THAT CONSUMERS ARE BETTER PROTECTED NOW -- MAYBE SWITCHING GEARS UP FOR A MOMENT -- THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE THE CONTRACTORS BOND AMOUNT A FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS A SUFFICIENT. OR NOT COULD YOU COMMENT UPON THAT. WELL I I BELIEVE A SOMETHING THAT OUR BOARD WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT WE HAVE AN AND PRIOR SUNSET REFUSED TO DISCUSS RAISING THE BOND AND DURING THOSE -- HEARINGS THAT THERE WAS OPPOSITION FROM SOME OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO PERFORM UNDER WRITING. BUT I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK OUR BOARD WOULD BE INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A KEVIN -- MARLOWE WHICH LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING TO THAT. NO I THINK IT'S SOME WE DEFINITELY LOOK AT CONSIDERING -- YOU KNOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND IS NOT A HUGE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO HARM CONSUMER YEAH WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT TRYING TO KEEP THE BARRIERS TO LICENSURE DOWN -- IN ALLOW PEOPLE INTO THE QUALIFIED PEOPLE INTO THE INDUSTRY SO I THINK THAT'S THE BALANCE IF I REMEMBER RIGHT COUPLE YEARS AGO WE INCREASED. THE BOND AMOUNT TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FROM -- TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND ELIMINATED THE THE AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR CONTRACTORS SO THAT THAT WOULD BE OUR BALANCE -- AND IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO LOOK AT AND AND WHAT'S THE COST TO IT CONTRACTOR OF THE BOND. TYPICALLY. AT THAT LEVEL OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND I I WOULD BE SPECULATING I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S MUCH BUT I THINK THE CONCERN -- AS REGISTRAR FULL POINTED OUT WOULD BE THE UNDERWRITING AND THE ABILITY FOR CONTRACTORS TO GET. A BOND OF YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE OR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THAT. BUT ISN'T THE UNDERWRITING. TO ENSURE THAT -- AND HAS THE FINANCIAL MEANS IN WHICH TO WORK IN THIS AREA. APPS ABSOLUTELY AND AND WHAT WE LICENSE CONTRACTORS WERE LICENSING CONTRACTORS THAT DO. YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR BATHROOM REPAIRS OR FOR EXCUSE ME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR ABOUT THE REPAIRS ANYTHING UNDER. FIVE HUNDRED ARE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A LICENSE -- TO THESE MEGA YOU KNOW MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES THAT ARE BUILDING YOU KNOW SKYSCRAPERS AND BRIDGES SO IT'S IT'S ABOUT. RIGHT WELL I CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR REVIEW OF THAT TO AND I AND I'M NOTMAKING A JUDGMENT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. EXCEPT -- TO KNOW THAT. A LOT OF WORK -- THAT'S A PRETTY LOW THRESHOLD. RIGHT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF WORK AT THE FINE WHICH FALL BENEATH THAT -- AND THE TYPICAL HOME BUT I AND I I I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT ACCESS -- AND AND HOW THIS MAY AFFECT COST BUT I AT LEAST YEAH I'D BE INTERESTED IN EVIDENCE THAT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. THAT COSTS OF ARE GOING TO CREATE ISSUES SO I APPRECIATE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THAT -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR OBSERVATIONS -- FROM THE PANEL OF NOT I'M AN OPEN UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT INVITE ANYONE WHO HEARS WAS LIKE. TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS TO COME UP THE MICROPHONE AND AND HOPEFULLY BRIEFLY -- SPEAK PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF BY MARIA GARCIA WITH GREENBERG TRAURIG HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THE BOARD HAS DONE. A WITH OUR TRADE BOTH IN AT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY ACTIVITY AND ENFORCEMENT AND IN ADDITION TO HELPING MAINTAIN THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE SEA TWENTY SEVEN LICENSURE OF WHICH ARE MEMBERS ALL. MAINTAIN AND TWELVE HUNDRED MEMBERS THROUGH ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING RICHARD MARX AND ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION THE PLUMBING HEATING COOLING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA. AMERICAN FIRE SPRINKLER ASSOCIATION AND THE INDEPENDENT ROOFING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA I'VE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE WORKED WITH -- THE LAST THREE REGISTRARS A NUMBER OF THE BOARD MEMBERS AND STAFF -- ALL OF MY CLIENTS STRONGLY SO ATTENUATION OF THE BOARD AND TO YOUR QUESTION -- CENTER GLACIER. I'VE WITNESSED -- HOW SERIOUSLY THE BOARD -- TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE BALANCE BETWEEN MAKING SURE THAT THE CONSUMER IS PROTECTED BY AN ADEQUATE BOND IN INSURANCE UP WITHOUT A CREATING BARS TO NEW ENTRANTS TO THE FIELD. CONSTRUCTION IS A VERY POPULAR AREA. FOR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO'VE LEARNED THE CONSTRUCTION TRADE -- EITHER THROUGH CRAFT TRADING OR TO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM TO BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR AND TO ENTER THE WORK FORCE -- AS A PRACTITIONER -- AND SO IT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT BALANCE THAT THE BOARD HAS BEEN FOLLOWING -- THAT WE NOT CREATE BARRIERS -- TO THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE WISH TO START THEIR OWN CONTRACTING BUSINESS -- AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT CONSUMERS PARTICULARLY IF THE VERY LARGE PROJECT IS BEING UNDERTAKEN ARE CERTAINLY FREE -- TO INSIST THAT THEIR CONTRACTOR HAVE RISK -- HOPEFULLY -- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY LARGE HOME REMODELING PROJECTS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS -- THEIR MORE SOPHISTICATED WOULD UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT THEIR CONTRACTOR HAS ADEQUATE -- LIABILITY PROTECTION WE APPRECIATE YOUR THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PHIL VERMAELEN REPRESENTING THE FLASHER BARRICADE ASSOCIATION I HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE CONTRACTORS BOARD ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE HAVE WORKED WITH QUITE A FEW REGISTRARS AND QUITE A FEW STAFF THROUGH THE YEARS. AND I'VE GOT TO TAKE MY HAT OFF THAT I THINK THAT THEY'RE FINALLY AT A POINT WHERE THEY'RE REALLY DOING WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. IS HUGE WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THAT THEY'RE LITERALLY EATING THE LAUNCH OF THE LEGITIMATE CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE AND WE'VE GOT A ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. COME OUT WITH OF OTHER WAYS OF ENFORCEMENT -- AFTER THESE TYPES OF PEOPLES BUT I THINK THE LICENSE BOARD'S DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB. IN TERMS OF THE BONDS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS BUT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT THAT THE CONSUMER CAN CLAIM OUT OF THAT BOND IS ONLY SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO YOU MAY HAVE A FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND BUT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT IS FAR LESS THAN THAT. AND I THINK THAT DOES NEED TO BE LOOKED AT IT'S AS WELL THAT I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT WE WANT TO OPEN UP AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE LICENSES POSSIBLE WE DON'T WANT TO CHILL THAT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE WANT TO MAKE. SURE THAT CONSUMERS PROTECTED SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE BALANCE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE. TO GO IN WITH BOTH EYES OPEN AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO GO ADDRESSES TO HELP THE CONSUMER. WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AND IT WE WE EXPERIENCE THAT SAME DILEMMA IN IN THE IN THE CAR INSURANCE SPACE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE MINIMUM COVERAGES THAT WE IN THE STATE REQUIRE.
