WANT TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR THE. THE SHARP ANALYSIS DONE. IS OF RELATIVELY. NEGLIGIBLE FISCAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL. AND QUITE HONESTLY THIS IS THIS JUST PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR US TO ESTABLISH A NEUTRAL. THIRD PARTY WITHIN THE STAB WAS COMPREHENSIVE LABOR RELATIONS STATUTE AND PRECEDENT TO DEAL WITH. MATTERS MOVING FORWARD. WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY EMPLOYEES AT. THE PA. BART DISTRICT. WHO ARE SUPERVISORY CHECKING UP PROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL IN NATURE? WE WOULD AT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THE MOTION I MISS CARILLO. IT THE SECOND TIME MISTER CHAO THANK YOU. JOSTLED WILK WITHOUT SUMMIT IS HERE ANSWER TEST NO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS. I THEIR OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JIM LIGHTS ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT DISTRICT. WE DO HAVE SOME DIFFERENT THOUGHTS ON THE COST TO THE DISTRICT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MICHAEL JONES ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER WITH PART TWO. TO THAT. GOOD MORNING I'M MADAM CHAIR COMMITMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS A MY NAME IS MICHAEL JONES AND THE ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER OF ADMINISTRATION AT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT DISTRICT. A BART POSES AB THREE ZERO THREE FOUR. FIRST WE BELIEVE THIS BILL CREATES A NEW STATE MANDATE WITH SIGNIFICANT REIMBURSABLE COST BAR. I WE ESTIMATE THAT NEW ADMINISTRATIVE COST OF ABOUT NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DISC BICU REFERRAL TO PER. A AND WE HAVE ISSUES THAT COULD BE UNDER DISPUTE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ABOUT A TWELVE OR THIRTEEN. THAT. BUT ESTIMATES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND. THIRTY FIVE STUDENT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER. A DISPUTE. ADDITIONALLY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE NEW PROCESS UNDER THEM AND BE A PART WOULD NEED TO EMPLOY A TECHNICAL. CONSULTANTS. AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND UP FURTHERMORE TO MANAGE THE MBA PROCESS WOULD NEED TO HIRE AT LEAST THREE NEW PEOPLE. AT AN ANNUAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. IN TOTAL THIS IS A POTENTIAL REIMBURSABLE COST OF NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR. NECKS A IT WOULD BE A GREATER FISCAL IMPACT TO THE STATE THAN A MODEST COST OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THE ANALYSIS SUPPOSES THAT ONLY A MINOR NUMBER. OF DISPUTES EACH YEAR. HOWEVER BASED ON THE CURRENT NUMBER OF DISPUTES BETWEEN BART AND THE EMPLOYEE UNION THE FISCAL IMPACT TO THE STATE WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE FORTY THOUSAND. A DOLLAR ESTIMATE FOR THESE REASONS MARK OPPOSES A. B. THIRTY THIRTY FOUR RESPECTFULLY ACTUALLY AN OBOE. THANK YOU KNOW IS THERE ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. I FINANCE NO FILE. I THINK MISTER QUIRK HAS QUESTION. YEAH SHOW FOR THE PROPONENTS. A TECHNICAL QUESTION WHY IS THERE THIS BIG DIFFERENCE IAN ESTIMATES OF COSTS. AND AND HOW DO YOU BAY ISSUERS I'VE HEARD HOW THE BASE THERE'S. PART IS BASING OF THEIR COSTS IT APPEARS ON. EVERY DISPUTE THEIR CURSE BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER. AND OUR MEMBERS AS GOING TO PER WHICH WILL BE THE CASE. RARELY DO DISPUTES RISE TO THE LEVEL OF ACTUALLY FILING AN UNFAIR PRACTICE BEFORE PER. WE ACTUALLY HOPE THAT THE STATURE OF A FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY AN NDA. AND HAVING PROVES OVERSIGHT WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DISPUTES AND PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT WE GET TO THE LEVEL OF HEADING TOWARD SOMETHING LIKE PER. OKAY AND THEY ALSO SAY THAT THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED THEY'RE GONNA. AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT AND THEY NEED THREE NEW PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS DONE. BOB I THINK THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BART HAS A VERY ROBUST LEGAL AND LABOR RELATIONS TEAM WITH. VERY TO EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THAT TIME THE BART INCLUDING SOME THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING UNDER AN MBA AND WHISPERED SO I. FIND IT IS CHANGED INTERESTING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO AUGMENT THEIR STAFF TO. DO THIS FOR A UNIT THAT ONLY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MEMBERS. AND THAT WILL LIKELY NOT RESULT IN VERY MANY CASES ACTUALLY GOING TO PER. AREN'T YOU MADE A GOOD CASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS I'D SAY WITH TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR PART COMPLAINTS THAT MAYBE THERE'S PROMISED MANAGEMENT SELF WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.
