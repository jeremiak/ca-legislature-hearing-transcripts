00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:12.076 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:13.978 region:rollup2

AND IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO THOUSAND

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:22.053 region:rollup2
EIGHT THAT THE PROBLEM AROSE

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:24.122 region:rollup2
WITH A UNIFORM CIVIL FILING FEE

00:40:22.053 --> 00:40:25.189 region:rollup2
WENT INTO EFFECT. IT TOOK AWAY

00:40:24.122 --> 00:40:27.158 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF COUNTY

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:29.961 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS TO RAISE THAT

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:30.461 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE CIVIL FILING FEES

THAT WENT TO COUNTY LAW

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:34.699 region:rollup2
LIBRARIES SO THERE HAVE BEEN FOR

00:40:33.064 --> 00:40:36.267 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN THE CIVIL FILING

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:38.903 region:rollup2

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:42.273 region:rollup2
WERE ALLOCATED TO COUNTY LAW

00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:44.208 region:rollup2
LIBRARIES THEY ALL WENT TO THE

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:46.844 region:rollup2

THINGS IN THAT METHOD RATHER

00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:03.594 region:rollup2

FLAWED.

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:24.048 region:rollup2
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:41:21.913 --> 00:41:25.616 region:rollup2
PAPERWORK IS FLAWED THAT

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:28.019 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CASES PUT OVER THE

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:29.787 region:rollup2
COURTS WASTED TIME THAT DAY ON

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:32.023 region:rollup2
THAT CASE. AND THAT.

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:34.392 region:rollup2
STALLS THE WHOLE PROCESS OF OF

OF COURT OPERATIONS.

00:41:34.392 --> 00:41:38.396 region:rollup2

COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES BE FUNDED

00:41:38.396 --> 00:41:41.299 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME LAW LIBRARIES THAT

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:42.533 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF ACTUALLY

00:41:41.299 --> 00:41:44.669 region:rollup2
CLOSING.

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:45.903 region:rollup2
THIS FORTY PERCENT AGGREGATE CUT

00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:48.239 region:rollup2
THAT HAS OCCURRED ACROSS THE

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:49.807 region:rollup2
STATE HAS IMPACTED DIFFERENT

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:51.509 region:rollup2
LIBRARIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:53.077 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE. LEVEL OF LOS

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:54.178 region:rollup2

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:55.313 region:rollup2
LOST FUNDING.

YOU VERY MUCH.

00:41:55.313 --> 00:41:58.816 region:rollup2

YEAH. WHERE?

00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:02.954 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ARRIVE AT THE FIGURE

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:05.023 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION?

00:42:02.954 --> 00:42:06.924 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION IS

00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:08.259 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:10.862 region:rollup2
COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES WRIST

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:13.331 region:rollup2
RECEIVING WHEN THE UNIFORM CIVIL

FILING FEE WENT INTO EFFECT AND

00:42:13.331 --> 00:42:16.501 region:rollup2
THE LATEST YEAR FOR WHICH WE

HAVE NUMBERS WHICH IS TO. FISCAL

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:20.004 region:rollup2
YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

00:42:18.603 --> 00:42:22.073 region:rollup2
OKAY SO WHAT WOULD THERE BE SOME

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:23.808 region:rollup2
KIND OF PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION YES

00:42:22.073 --> 00:42:26.611 region:rollup2

SERVING IN THIS LEGISLATURE I

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:51.662 region:rollup2
WAS THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF BIG

00:43:50.328 --> 00:43:52.930 region:rollup2
BEAR LAKE AND WHILE I WAS MAYOR.

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:54.565 region:rollup2
WE HAD OUR COURTHOUSE IN BIG

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:56.400 region:rollup2
BEAR CLOSED AND SO I GOT TO SEE

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:58.436 region:rollup2
FIRSTHAND THE EFFECTS ON A

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.637 region:rollup2

LOSE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND IT

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:06.144 region:rollup2
GAVE ME AN INCREDIBLY POIGNANT

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:07.545 region:rollup2
APPRECIATION FOR THE FACT THAT

00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:09.680 region:rollup2

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:13.017 region:rollup2
JUSTICE.

00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:14.418 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THIS

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:15.887 region:rollup2
POSITION I CAME TO REALIZE THAT

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.854 region:rollup2
WHEN OUR COURTHOUSE WAS CLOSED

00:44:15.887 --> 00:44:18.356 region:rollup2
ON THAT DAY WASN'T JUST OUR

OUR COURTHOUSE IN BIG BEAR IS

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:27.398 region:rollup2

00:47:54.105 --> 00:47:58.476 region:rollup2
TO USE AS THEY SEE FIT HOPEFULLY

00:47:56.006 --> 00:48:00.010 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THE WAIT TIME AND. AN

00:47:58.476 --> 00:48:02.646 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS.

LANGUAGES TRYING TO LOOK BECAUSE

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:12.390 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BASICALLY

SAY IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO

REDUCE THE.

00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:17.027 region:rollup2
THE WORKLOAD WHICH WHICH WOULD

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.173 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT DISCRETION SHOULD

00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:33.244 region:rollup2

THIS FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S A

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:59.095 region:rollup2
VICTIM CENTERED FORM OF

AND SPELLS ABUSE HAS. AND.

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:09.906 region:rollup2
IT TAKES AWHILE TO COOPERATE

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:11.374 region:rollup2
WITH AN ATTORNEY WITH STANDARD

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:12.676 region:rollup2

ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH A

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:15.946 region:rollup2
NEW PERSON EACH TIME AND THAT

01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:17.113 region:rollup2
MAKES IT NOT ONLY DIFFICULT FOR

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.815 region:rollup2
THE VICTIM BUT MAKES IT MORE

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.749 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE THE CASES

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:21.985 region:rollup2

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:32.028 region:rollup2
GOOD AT THOSE CASES THAT ARE

01:00:30.527 --> 01:00:33.730 region:rollup2
QUITE COMPLEX.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:35.265 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'VE SEEN THE SUCCESS OF

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.600 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS I IN OTHER PARTS

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:38.001 region:rollup2

I I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS A

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.583 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY NEEDED FUNDING NOW

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:55.785 region:rollup2

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.417 region:rollup2
ASSUME. OF

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:42.118 region:rollup2
SO WHY WOULD WE FUNDING

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:43.620 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THEY CAN ALREADY DO

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:44.921 region:rollup2
BUDGET TWO PARTS TO THAT AND

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.690 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WELCOME MAT MISTER

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:48.858 region:rollup2
HOFFMAN'S IF THE FIRST IS THAT

AT THIS BODY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:53.730 region:rollup2
THROUGH A HEARINGS FOUND THAT.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:55.598 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE ABLE TO FIND VERTICAL

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:57.667 region:rollup2
PROSECUTION AND JUSTIN NINE TO

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:59.135 region:rollup2
ELEVEN COUNTIES THAT DID NOT

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.570 region:rollup2
HAVE THE FUNDING TO COMMIT TO

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:02.672 region:rollup2
THOSE PARTICULAR.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.240 region:rollup2
STYLE OF OF PROSECUTION THAT WE

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:05.608 region:rollup2
COULD MAKE GREAT HEADWAY IN

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.110 region:rollup2
THOSE COUNTIES WITH HUMAN

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.811 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING CASES BUT IT WAS THE

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:11.081 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:04:07.811 --> 01:04:11.081 region:rollup2
HELP THAT THEY NEEDED IN ORDER

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:15.285 region:rollup2
CASES THEY TAKE MORE RESOURCES.

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:16.653 region:rollup2
AND AS IN ANY CASE WHEN WE'RE

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:18.388 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT WE HAVE A

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:19.322 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH A FAST

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.423 region:rollup2
GROWING CRIME IN OUR AREA WE

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.024 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE MAKING THE

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:22.158 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES TO DO

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:23.460 region:rollup2

COUNTY LINES

01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:33.403 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.771 region:rollup2
THIS SHOULD BE A STATE PRIORITY

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:36.239 region:rollup2

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:39.308 region:rollup2
SKILLS AND STEM SKILLS. WE ALSO

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:40.710 region:rollup2
JUDGE THE PROGRAM'S SUCCESS

01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:42.512 region:rollup2
BASED ON DEMAND INCREASING

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:44.614 region:rollup2
DEMAND AND THEY'RE SO MUCH

01:09:42.512 --> 01:09:47.650 region:rollup2
DEMAND NOW THAT WE HAVE TO SAY

01:09:44.614 --> 01:09:49.919 region:rollup2
NO TO FORTY SIX SCHOOLS. IN

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:51.487 region:rollup2
THOSE COUNTIES THAT ASSEMBLY

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:52.689 region:rollup2
MEMBER QUIRK SILVA MENTIONED.

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.990 region:rollup2
THAT'S ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:56.325 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT WANT TO

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:57.627 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE BUT CAN'T SO THIS.

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:59.095 region:rollup2
A NEW FACILITY THIS NEW

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:01.831 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM WILL ALLOW THAT THIS

01:09:59.095 --> 01:10:03.599 region:rollup2
FEDERAL PROGRAM TO EXPAND TO

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:04.167 region:rollup2
INCLUDE ALL FORTY SIX OF THOSE

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:06.969 region:rollup2
CLASSES THAT ARE ON THE WAIT

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:08.004 region:rollup2
LIST.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.139 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS.

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:11.574 region:rollup2
THAT THIS. YOUNG PEOPLE SPENT A

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:13.943 region:rollup2
WEEK AT THIS PLACE IS THAT

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:15.878 region:rollup2
CORRECT YES MA'AM OKAY AND SO

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:17.547 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING THE FUNDING FOR THAT

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:18.514 region:rollup2
KIND OF PROGRAM IS DONE THROUGH

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.615 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:21.584 region:rollup2
CORRECT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:22.518 region:rollup2
PAYS FOR THE TEACHERS AND FOR

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.519 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:25.054 region:rollup2
ALL THE. EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:27.156 region:rollup2
THREE D. PRINTERS THEY HAVE

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.557 region:rollup2
SIMULATION SOFTWARE THE UPROOTED

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:30.259 region:rollup2
MATT.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:32.295 region:rollup2
PROTOTYPING SOFTWARE ALL KINDS

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.995 region:rollup2
OF REALLY HIGH TECH GADGETS ALL

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:34.664 region:rollup2
PAID FOR BY THE FEDERAL

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:37.533 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS DOES THIS BUDGET

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:38.801 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION IS DESIGNED FOR

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:40.303 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITY.

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:41.971 region:rollup2
FOR ONE CLASSROOM YASSIN A

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:43.372 region:rollup2
MILLION ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.707 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO BILL AND FUND THE

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:46.876 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS RESPONSIBILITY AS FOR

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:48.644 region:rollup2
THE TRANSPORTATION AND I KNOW

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:50.813 region:rollup2
THAT SEVERAL OF THEM ARE ABLE TO

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:52.882 region:rollup2
ALSO. APPLY FOR GRANTS WITHIN

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:54.217 region:rollup2
THEIR DISTRICTS BUT YES IT'S ONE

01:10:52.882 --> 01:10:56.786 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:57.186 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A PORTABLE TOILETS THAT

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:58.554 region:rollup2
SET SO WE HAVE A.

01:10:57.186 --> 01:11:00.923 region:rollup2
.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:02.992 region:rollup2
TRAINING BASE IN LOS ALAMEDA IS

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:04.761 region:rollup2
THAT ALREADY HAS AN EXISTING

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:06.462 region:rollup2
STARBASE CLASSROOMS OF THIS

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:08.231 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AN EXACT DUPLICATE.

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:09.732 region:rollup2
BUILT RIGHT NEXT TO IT

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:12.101 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:13.936 region:rollup2
COMBINED SO WE ALREADY HAVE THE

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:14.837 region:rollup2
DID THE BUILDING DESIGNED. THIS

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:17.206 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST BE THE CONSTRUCTION

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:18.741 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S TO CLASSROOMS AND

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:19.709 region:rollup2
RESTROOMS

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:21.210 region:rollup2
IN ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:23.813 region:rollup2
SQUARE FEET.

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:25.548 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE ON PROPERTY THAT'S

01:11:23.813 --> 01:11:27.216 region:rollup2
ALREADY CONTROLLED BY THAT. THAT

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:28.251 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:30.453 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NO LAND COSTS.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:32.622 region:rollup2
.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:34.590 region:rollup2
AND THE DESIGN IS ALREADY.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:36.159 region:rollup2
I'M PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE IT

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:38.161 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST HAVE TO BE.

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:46.869 region:rollup2
UPDATED SO THERE'S VERY LITTLE

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:47.370 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF DESIGN COST AS WELL

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.805 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALL PRETTY MUCH

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:52.008 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:53.976 region:rollup2
NO PROGRAM WHICH UP IS THE SUN

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:56.312 region:rollup2
AS THE SUN BURST.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:58.047 region:rollup2
THE SUNBURST YOUTH ACADEMY WHERE

01:11:56.312 --> 01:12:00.449 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HIGH

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:02.251 region:rollup2
SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE.

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:04.220 region:rollup2
HAPPY STRUGGLING THROUGH HIGH

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:05.221 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SAID THAT IS AN ACTUAL

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.255 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHERE THEY LIVE ON THE

01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:08.157 region:rollup2
BASE

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:10.693 region:rollup2
SO THIS WAS BROUGHT FORWARD OUT

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:12.995 region:rollup2
WITH FORMER SPEAKER JOHN PEREZ.

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:14.597 region:rollup2
HIT THIS THIS THAT WAS THAT THE

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:16.866 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL CLASSROOM CAME THROUGH

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:18.634 region:rollup2
HIS INVESTMENT SO WITHOUT IS NOW

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:20.469 region:rollup2
BEEN ABOUT FOUR YEARS.

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:22.872 region:rollup2
AND NOW BECAUSE IT'S GROW ON THE

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:25.608 region:rollup2
SECOND ASKA. IS FOR THIS

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:27.577 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CLASSROOM.

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:28.377 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:30.079 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE OF THESE IN

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:31.814 region:rollup2
THE STATE THERE'S ONE HERE IN

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.381 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO AS WELL FOLK AND IT'S

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:34.150 region:rollup2
LOCATED IN SOUTH SACRAMENTO

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:38.087 region:rollup2
NEAR.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:39.021 region:rollup2
TOLD BT COLLINS RESERVE BASE

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:41.224 region:rollup2
AND.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:42.725 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN ARMORY THERE AND

01:12:41.224 --> 01:12:44.227 region:rollup2
IT'S LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:45.061 region:rollup2
ARMY SAID ONLY HOW MANY KIDS ARE

01:12:44.227 --> 01:12:47.330 region:rollup2
SERVED IN THIS BUT IN THIS

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.697 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO RIGHT NOW THERE ARE

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:48.664 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.399 region:rollup2
.

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:51.834 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT GO THROUGH EVERY

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:52.802 region:rollup2
YEAR THAT GOES WITH PROGRAM IN

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:54.804 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:56.572 region:rollup2
DISTILLING THIS'LL INCREASE THAT

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:59.242 region:rollup2
NUMBER TO FIVE THOUSAND TOTAL.

01:12:56.572 --> 01:13:00.443 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:02.178 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON THE

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:03.713 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ON KIDS

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:06.048 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY LEAVE. SO WHAT THEY

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:07.583 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO DO ARE. NOW WHAT WE

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:08.885 region:rollup2
REALLY DON'T I MEAN. WE WERE

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:10.853 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:12.188 region:rollup2
THE COURSE THE HOPE IS THAT IT

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:13.522 region:rollup2
SPARKED SOMETHING IN THE STUDENT

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:16.892 region:rollup2
THAT WILL.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:17.693 region:rollup2
PROP THEM TO PROCEED. WITH.

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:19.395 region:rollup2
AND EDUCATION IN THE STEM.

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:20.863 region:rollup2
SUBJECTS

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:22.531 region:rollup2
THETEACHERS AS WELL SO THE

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:24.800 region:rollup2
TEACHERS LEARN SOMETHING TO THE

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:26.102 region:rollup2
TEACHERS ARE GIVEN. A CURRICULUM

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.970 region:rollup2
AND TOOLS.

01:13:26.102 --> 01:13:30.873 region:rollup2
TO TAKE BACK TO THE CLASSROOM

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:33.109 region:rollup2
TO TO IN TO IT ESSENTIALLY

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:34.644 region:rollup2
EXTEND THE STARBASE EXPERIENCE

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:36.679 region:rollup2
BACK IN THEIR SCHOOL.

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:38.147 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DOES

01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:38.848 region:rollup2
NOT KEEP STATISTICS.

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:40.983 region:rollup2
ON.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:43.185 region:rollup2
ON ALL OF THE THE KIDS THAT

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:45.421 region:rollup2
ATTEND THIS PROGRAM NATIONWIDE.

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:47.290 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FUNDED FOR

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:49.158 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS.

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:49.992 region:rollup2
I THINK WE CAN ASSUME THAT IT.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.927 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE THERE HAVE BEEN

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.895 region:rollup2
STUDIES DONE WITHIN THE

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.996 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THAT.

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:56.032 region:rollup2
OKAY I HAVE SOME DIRECT

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:57.400 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY SO FROM THE TEACHERS

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:59.902 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE WORKED WITH OF THE

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.237 region:rollup2
INTO A WE ALWAYS GET. UP ASKED

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:02.772 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:05.408 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:08.277 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE AS

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:10.279 region:rollup2
EXCITING AS EXPECTED AND AND THE

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.247 region:rollup2
STUDENTS COME AWAY WITH A GREAT

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:13.516 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:15.518 region:rollup2
NOT. THIS ONE PARTICULARLY I

01:14:13.516 --> 01:14:17.153 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:18.287 region:rollup2
A VENN OUT OF THE CLASSROOM SOME

01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:19.755 region:rollup2
OF THE TEACHERS HAVE SAID THAT

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:21.490 region:rollup2
THEY FELT THAT IT'S BEEN REALLY

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:23.659 region:rollup2
IMPACTFUL BECAUSE IT'S ALLOWING

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:26.462 region:rollup2
THEM TO DO THINGS ON SITE THAT

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:28.397 region:rollup2
THEY. CAN'T NECESSARILY DO IN A

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:30.433 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM IT'S A LAB SETTING

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:31.934 region:rollup2
THERE'S A ROOMS THAT ALL SO

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:33.536 region:rollup2
FORTH SO.

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:35.071 region:rollup2

REALLY IMPRESSED THEY WERE DOING

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:39.842 region:rollup2
A GOOD.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:41.510 region:rollup2
HOME.

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:43.045 region:rollup2
TAKING A EGG DEL ANNA. WHAT WAS

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:45.081 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT IT WAS SAID THEY

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:46.649 region:rollup2
WERE PROTOTYPING A OF A VESSEL

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:48.317 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PROTECT DAY YEAH A

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:50.119 region:rollup2
CHICKEN AND EGG? AS IT TRAVELED

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.354 region:rollup2
DOWN A WIRE ABOUT TWENTY FEET

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:53.022 region:rollup2
INTO A.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:54.757 region:rollup2
HARD SURFACE AND SO.

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:56.892 region:rollup2
THEIR TASK WAS TO DESIGN NECK.

A VEHICLE TO CARRY THAT THE ACT

01:14:56.892 --> 01:15:00.629 region:rollup2

AND TESTED IT. AS PART OF A.

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:04.934 region:rollup2

CONCERNING THIS.

01:46:26.914 --> 01:46:29.450 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I THINK

WILL FACE IS THAT WE HAVE A.

01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:33.420 region:rollup2
