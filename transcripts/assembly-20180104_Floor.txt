TAKING UP FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHTY FIVE THAT'S ACR ONE THIRTY FOR THE CORPORATE. ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE THIRTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO GAIN AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH. MR GARCIA EMAIL BUT MISTER SPEAKER IN COLLEAGUES HAPPY NEW YEAR IT'S WITH GREAT HONOR THAT I GET TO PRESENT ACR. ONE THIRTY FOUR. HE SEAT ARE ONE THIRTY FOUR IS GANG AWARENESS. AND PREVENTION MONTH HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PUNE THIS RESOLUTION DESIGNATES THE MONTH OF JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS GOING AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND ENCOURAGES CITIES AND CONSTITUENTS ACROSS THE STATE POSER OBSERVE THIS MONTH WITH APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS CEREMONIES AND ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT FUTURE GANG ACTIVITY AND HONOR THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES DUE TO GANG. VIOLENCE SPECIFICALLY THIS RESOLUTION MAKES THE FOLLOWING LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS. GANG VIOLENCE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN AVERAGE OF TWO THOUSAND GANG RELATED HOMICIDES EACH YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL YOUTH GANG CENTER. CALIFORNIANS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE FIRST RESPONDERS DO NOT HAVE TO RESPOND TO CRIME SCENES AND DYING VICTIMS IN DANGER SURROUNDINGS WHERE THEY CAN BECOME THE NEXT TARGETS. LOCAL COMMUNITIES NEED TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND THAT GANG AFFILIATION AND ACTIVITY IS PREVENTABLE. THE SOLUTION TO GANG VIOLENCE IS WITHIN EVERY CALIFORNIAN. CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE WILL COURAGE AND INNER STRENGTH TO STAND UP TO THEIR MORAL OBLIGATION AS A CITIZEN OF THEIR COMMUNITY. TO HELP BY THE TEARING OUR YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES FROM VIOLENCE BY EDUCATING THEM ON HOW TO FORM STRONGER FAMILY BONDS. THEY'RE IN THE HOUSEHOLD AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AN ORGANIZATION IN OUR DISTRICT. MOTHERS AND MAN AGAINST GANG VIOLENCE IS A COALITION THE PERFECT EXAMPLE. OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS WORKING TIRELESSLY HARD TO PREVENT THIS GANG ACTIVITY. AND MAKING SURE THAT NO FAMILY HAS TO SUFFER THE LOSS OF LIFE. MEMBERS. THIS RESOLUTION. AND THE IDEA CAME TO US VIA A FAMILY. FAMILY BY THE NAME OF YOU NEED AND MIGHT THINK CARS THAT WHO ARE FROM IMPERIAL COUNTY. UNFORTUNATELY YOU NEED AND MY THE THEME. LOST THEIR SON. A VERY TALENTED YOUNG MAN WHO WAS IN HIS SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. FOOTBALL STAR LIKED BY EVERYONE. OLDER BROTHER TWO SISTERS MY GOOD FRIEND. BUT TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY A YOUNG MAN WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE. WHO UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO A GANG MEMBER? LOST HIS LIFE SENSIBLY. AND. YOU NEEDN'T THE MOTHER OF MY BEAN AND THE FATHER. SAID. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THE LOSS OF OUR SON BE IN VAIN. AND SO THEY'VE MADE IT THEIR MISSION SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. I THEY'VE ESTABLISHED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE. MOTHERS AND MEN. AGAINST GANG VIOLENCE. AND THEIR MISSION IS TO. IT EDUCATE. EVERY PARENT WORK WITH OUR SCHOOLS ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND NOW BEGIN TO EXPAND THEIR SPHERE. OF INFLUENCE AS IT RELATES TO THEM TELLING THEIR STORY. AND DOT I BRING THIS RESOLUTION TO YOU HUMBLY BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT STEMS FROM. OUR DISTRICT. BUT EVERY YEAR IN JANUARY YOU NO WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS. WHETHER IT BE I'M GOING TO EXERCISE MORE I'M GOING TO DO MORE OF THIS OR LESS OF THAT. AND SO TODAY I ASK THAT. JANUARY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE RECOMMIT OURSELVES. TO THE ISSUE OF GANG VIOLENCE AWARENESS PREVENTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK UP FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON ACR. ONE THIRTY FOUR AND DOT AGAIN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MR GARCIA WOULD YOU LIKE CO AUTHORS ON THE RESOLUTIONS R. YES I WOULD ASK THAT THE FIRST CALL BE OPEN FOR COOPER'S. THANK YOU. THINGS GARCIA DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I. I APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA FOR A BRING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD AND I THINK WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS ON THIS FLOOR TO IN TERMS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE TO TALK ABOUT GANGS AND. AND LIST AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT ONE OF THINGS I THINK WE ALL AGREE UPON IS THAT NO COMMUNITY SHOULD EVER BE IN IN CONTROL OF BY GANGS. NO COMPLETELY SHOULD EVER FEEL A SENSE OF LOSS AND AND HOPELESSNESS BECAUSE OF THE GANGS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN AFFECTED BY GANG VIOLENCE WE'VE ALL HAD THE THE FRIENDS OR FAMILY SO CONSTITUENTS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES ARE WHO'VE EITHER JUST BEEN INTIMIDATED. BY THE GANG VIOLENCE THAT EXISTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED AND I'VE WORKED WITH A LOT OF GANG UGH ARE ANTI GAY GROUPS AS WELL AS FORMER GANG MEMBERS. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS IS THAT GANG GANG VIOLENCE AND GANG ACTIVITY IS PREVENTABLE. IT IT STANDS VERY EARLY IN LIFE FROM A NOT HAVING THAT SCHOOLS THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE. NOT HAVING FAMILIES THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE HAVING FAMILIES TO WORK SO MANY HOURS EVERY DAY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME AND ENERGY TO INVEST IN THEIR CHILDREN. NOT HAVING THE KIND OF PARK AND RECREATION PROGRAMS THAT NURTURE AND CARE FOR CHILDREN SO WE KNOW THAT IT IS PREVENTABLE. THAT WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF LIVES AND WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF MONEY WITH REGARDS TO BASICALLY SIMPLY INVESTING IN YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY ENOUGH. TO HELP TO PREVENT THAT THE STRENGTHENING OUR FAMILIES AND GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BASICALLY BE THE FAMILIES THEY WANT TO BE WHICH IS TO SUPPORT IT NURTURE OUR CHILDREN. WE'VE LEARNED THAT A LOT OF LOVE IT LLOYD MORE INCARCERATION. OF MORE VIOLENCE DOESN'T IN THAT IN ESSENCE DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I'VE SEEN IN MY OWN COMMUNITY WHERE WITH IT'S A CYCLE WHERE. WE HAVE SOME GANG INTERVENTION AND WE ROUND UP ALL THE GANG MEMBERS WE PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN YOU SIDE FIND THE GANG VIOLENCE STARTS AGAIN. AND I ASK THE QUESTION WHY DID IT START AGAIN WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON A SAID WELL ALL THE GANG MEMBERS JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL. AND SO IT BEGINS AGAIN AND SO WE HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE NOT ONLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO WHEN THOSE WERE PART CAR SERRATED TO BASICALLY BEGAN TO THE LEVEL OF INTERVENTION THERE. SO IT IS PREVENTABLE AND WE AS AS A AS A CALIFORNIANS NEED TO LOOK AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY RATHER THAN RUNNING AWAY FROM IT. WE NEED TO EMBRACE IT. ISIS SAY TO MY COMMUNITIES WHEN. WHEN THEY WILL TALK COUSINS EASE OF THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR. WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO EMBRACE THEM AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY THERE IS HOPE THERE'S A CHANCE FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN RUNNING AWAY. THESE ARE CHILDREN WHO WOULD TWO AND THREE IS ALL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE EMBRACED EARLY IN LIFE SO THEY COULD SEEK US SO I ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE FAMILIES WHO OUT THERE WORKING SO HARD. ON THIS TO CONTINUE THE WORK FOR US TO DO WHAT WE CAN IN TERMS OF RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GANG INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. THAT ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOT JUST BECAUSE WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT BUT BECAUSE IT SAVES LIVES AND IT ENSURES THE CALIFORNIA BECOMES A STRONG STATE THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF. I WANNA THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR THIS AYE I'LL ASK ALL OF YOU TO BOTH ACR ONE THIRTY FOUR BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO BEGIN TO LOOK AT YOUR OWN COMMUNITIES AND FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN BE ENGAGED. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. ALL DEBATE HAVING CEASED. MR GARCIA YOU MAY CLOSE ON THE RESOLUTION THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO I THINK. ARTICULATE EXACTLY. WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESOLUTION IS? IN OUR COMMUNITIES THERE'S WAYS THAT WE DEAL WITH. THE VIOLENCE THAT OCCURS IT WHETHER IT'S IN A BLUNT FORCE MEANT. TACTICS BUT I THINK WE ALSO HEARD JUST NOW THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO INVEST AND PREVENT. IN HAVING TO SPEND ALL THAT MONEY. ON THE REPRESSIVE APPROACH YOU KNOW TO THESE PROBLEMS IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR HER COMMENTS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK US THAT THE FIRST THAT ROLE BE OPEN FOR COOPERS. THINGS GARCIA. WITHOUT. CLARK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. MEMBERS THIS IS COAUTHORS. THIS IS CO AUTHORS ON THE RESOLUTION. THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS MEMBERS. CLERK WILL.
