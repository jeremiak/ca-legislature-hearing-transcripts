01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:14.922
THEY'RE COMPARABLE TO

CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS. THAT

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:19.360
LIST WOULD BE COMPILED BY DMV

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.628
THIS IT GIVES THEM THE ABILITY

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:22.263
TO LOOK AT THOSE STANDARDS- SO

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.564
WE HAVEN'T PICKED THE COUNTRY'S

IMPOSSIBLE TO EXTRAORDINARILY

02:50:11.167 --> 02:50:13.736

MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. BUT THAT'S

02:50:27.917 --> 02:50:32.155
OKAY. NO IT IS NOT OKAY. AND

02:50:32.221 --> 02:50:33.990
THIS IS NOT A PATHWAY TO

02:50:34.057 --> 02:50:36.693

WHICH. MR PRESIDENT I RISE-

02:51:00.149 --> 02:51:01.851
ECHOING SOME OF THE THOUGHTS OF

MY COLLEAGUE JUST MENTIONED.

02:51:04.487 --> 02:51:06.522
THE LINE THAT USED TO EXIST

02:51:06.589 --> 02:51:07.724
MAYBE AT ONE POINT IN TIME

02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:10.893
BETWEEN ST. FIVE ACTIVITY IN

02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:12.428
WHITE COLLAR ACTIVITIES

02:51:12.495 --> 02:51:14.831
DEFINITELY BEEN BLURRED. STREET

02:51:14.897 --> 02:51:16.633
GANGS HAVE CERTAINLY BECOME

02:51:16.699 --> 02:51:18.735
MORE SOPHISTICATED OVER TIME.

02:51:18.801 --> 02:51:20.970
THEN WE USE THE EXAMPLE OF MAIL

02:51:21.037 --> 02:51:23.439
THEFT OR IDENTITY THEFT STREET

02:51:23.506 --> 02:51:26.376
GANGS ARE PART OF A PROFIT

02:51:26.442 --> 02:51:29.679
RACKETEERING ENTERPRISE. AND SO

02:51:29.746 --> 02:51:31.581
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SET SEPARATE.

02:51:31.648 --> 02:51:33.282
SOME OF THESE OFFENSES FROM THE

02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:35.451
ENHANCEMENT PROCESS YOU ARE

02:51:35.518 --> 02:51:37.286

CAPABILITIES OF THESE

02:51:38.921 --> 02:51:41.024
ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTINUE. SO

02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:42.225
WHETHER THEY'RE SELLING

TYPES OF CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:49.499
THE PROFIT COMPONENT OF A GANG

02:51:49.565 --> 02:51:51.467
IS THE BEATING HEART OF AGAIN.

02:51:51.534 --> 02:51:53.503
AND SO TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

02:51:53.569 --> 02:51:56.706
ENHANCEMENT IS TO DO AWAY WITH.

02:51:56.773 --> 02:51:58.474
UNDOING RACKETEERING IN THIS

02:51:58.541 --> 02:52:00.610
COUNTRY. AND SO I DON'T I DON'T

02:52:00.677 --> 02:52:02.278

IS THE FINANCIAL COMPONENT THAT

02:52:08.718 --> 02:52:10.119
YOU CAN ALLOW THIS TO OCCUR.

02:52:10.186 --> 02:52:12.021

LEVIED AGAINST YOU WHETHER THEY

02:53:59.162 --> 02:54:01.764
HAVE BEEN TRUE OR NOT YOU WOULD

02:54:01.831 --> 02:54:03.933
WANT THOSE CHARGES COULD BE

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.435
PROVEN YOU WOULD NOT WANT FOLKS

02:54:06.502 --> 02:54:08.871
TO LEAN INTO A BIAS OR A STEREO

02:54:08.938 --> 02:54:12.575
TYPE OR A FEAR OF YOU. AND LET

02:54:12.642 --> 02:54:14.143
THAT BECOME A YES OR NO

02:54:14.210 --> 02:54:16.712
QUESTION RATHER THAN TO PROVE

02:54:16.779 --> 02:54:19.949
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. I

02:54:20.016 --> 02:54:22.151
AGREE MANY GANGS. HAVE A PROFIT

02:54:22.218 --> 02:54:25.588
MOTIVE. MANY GANGS ARE SAVVY

02:54:25.655 --> 02:54:27.356
AND SOPHISTICATED AND HIGHLY

02:54:27.423 --> 02:54:29.392
ORGANIZED WHICH IS WHY I

02:54:29.458 --> 02:54:31.527
QUESTIONED THE OPPOSITION'S

02:54:31.594 --> 02:54:34.130
PUSH TO SAY THAT GANGS ARE NOT

02:54:34.197 --> 02:54:37.133
ORGANIZED THAT THEY ARE I'M

02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:38.968
ORGANIZED AND FLUID. BECAUSE

02:54:39.035 --> 02:54:43.172
THEY'RE NOT. I WISH THIS BILL

02:54:43.239 --> 02:54:44.807
WASN'T AS STRINGENT AS THE

02:54:44.874 --> 02:54:46.309
RECALL LAWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE

02:54:46.375 --> 02:54:49.779
BOOKS. HEY MAN I YES YES I DO

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:52.281
BUT THEY'RE NOT THIS IS NOT

02:54:52.348 --> 02:54:58.788
UNFORTUNATELY. THE REALITY IS.

02:54:58.855 --> 02:55:01.891
A YOUNG MAN NAMED RAYMOND. WHO

02:55:01.958 --> 02:55:05.294
HAPPENED TO BE IN A GANG. STOLE

02:55:05.361 --> 02:55:07.463
SOME BEER AND A GALLON OF MILK.

02:55:07.530 --> 02:55:09.165
HE DID NOT STEAL BACK BECAUSE

02:55:09.232 --> 02:55:11.567
HE WAS IN A GANG HE STOLE IT

02:55:11.634 --> 02:55:13.236
BECAUSE HE WAS DESPERATE AND

02:55:13.302 --> 02:55:16.005
MAKING A BAD DECISION. A GANG

02:55:16.072 --> 02:55:17.440
ALLEGATION WAS LEVIED AGAINST

02:55:17.506 --> 02:55:23.179
HIM. BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO

02:55:23.246 --> 02:55:25.448
HAVE BEEN IN A GAME THE CRIME

02:55:25.514 --> 02:55:26.849
WAS NOT BASED ON HIS

02:55:26.916 --> 02:55:31.754
AFFILIATION. DEFENSE HAD TO

02:55:31.821 --> 02:55:38.261
pCOMPARE THAT WITH TERRELL A

02:55:38.327 --> 02:55:43.633
YOUNG MAN. WHO WAS A CRYPT. WHO

02:55:43.699 --> 02:55:46.502
MURDERED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

02:55:46.569 --> 02:55:49.272
POSTED IT ON HIS SOCIAL MEDIA.

02:55:49.338 --> 02:55:54.777
WE'RE GETTING SIGNS AND LOGOS.

02:55:54.844 --> 02:55:56.712
WHEN WAS APPOINTED WITHOUT A

02:55:56.779 --> 02:55:58.381
GANG ALLEGATIONS BEING LEVIED

02:55:58.447 --> 02:56:01.083
ON HIM HE WAS YES A YOUNG WHITE

02:56:01.150 --> 02:56:03.019
HIGH SCHOOL OR FROM PALACE

02:56:03.085 --> 02:56:05.988
THIRTIES. SO WE HAVE THAT STRY

02:56:06.055 --> 02:56:07.523
WASN'T TRUE IF THOSE TWO

02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:09.158
STORIES WEREN'T TRUE I WOULDN'T

02:56:09.225 --> 02:56:12.128
BE HERE. THE FACT THAT JAMES

02:56:12.194 --> 02:56:15.464
AND MIKE. WHO ARE ARIAN

02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:18.234
BROTHERHOOD GANG MEMBERS

02:56:18.301 --> 02:56:21.938
ACTIVELY INVOLVED. IN MURDEROUS

02:56:22.004 --> 02:56:24.674
ACTIVITIES AND SELLING MATH WHO

02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:27.310
HAVE REPEATEDLY GONE TO PRISON.

02:56:27.376 --> 02:56:30.179
WHAT EIGHT EIGHT TATTOOED ON

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:32.515
THEIR FOREHEAD FOR HEIL HITLER.

02:56:32.581 --> 02:56:34.583
AND HAVE NEVER HAD A GANG

02:56:34.650 --> 02:56:37.186
ALLEGATION LEVIED AGAINST THEM.

02:56:37.253 --> 02:56:38.688
IF I HAVEN'T HAD CONVERSATIONS

02:56:38.754 --> 02:56:40.089
WITH THE OPPOSITION WHO TOLD ME

02:56:40.156 --> 02:56:41.624
THAT QUITE FRANKLY MISSED

02:56:41.691 --> 02:56:43.326
CAMELOT OCCUR BLACK AND BROWN

02:56:43.392 --> 02:56:45.161
GANGS ARE JUST FAR MORE

02:56:45.227 --> 02:56:46.762
DANGEROUS THAN ANY OTHER GANGS.

02:56:46.829 --> 02:56:49.699
THEN I WOULDN'T BE HERE I'M NOT

02:56:49.765 --> 02:56:52.034
MAKING UP THESE STORIES.

02:56:52.101 --> 02:56:54.170
ULTIMATELY WHAT I'M SAYING IS

02:56:54.236 --> 02:56:56.639
THAT IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE

02:56:56.706 --> 02:56:59.041
SOMEONE PUT THE CASE. BECAUSE

02:56:59.108 --> 02:57:00.810
GOING TO JAIL FOR A LIFETIME

02:57:00.876 --> 02:57:02.111
BECAUSE SOMEONE LOOKS AT YOU

02:57:02.178 --> 02:57:04.013
AND SAYS YOU HAVE A SHAVED HEAD

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.681
BECAUSE SOME POLICE OFFICER

02:57:05.748 --> 02:57:08.184
IDENTIFIED YOU BASED ON MAYBE

02:57:08.250 --> 02:57:08.784
THEIR OWN BIASES OR WHAT THEY

02:57:08.851 --> 02:57:11.988
HAVE SEEN. SHOULD NOT ALLOW YOU

02:57:12.054 --> 02:57:13.923
TO BE SENT TO PRISON BECAUSE OF

02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:15.624
A GANG ALLEGATION WITH A TERM

02:57:15.691 --> 02:57:17.860
THAT IS LONGER. THEN WHEN THE

02:57:17.927 --> 02:57:19.862
BASE CRIME IS. I'M HERE TO TELL

02:57:19.929 --> 02:57:23.332
YOU THAT 96% OF THESE CASES.

02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:25.301
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU. THAT GANG

02:57:25.368 --> 02:57:26.435
MEMBERS DON'T DO STUFF IN THE

02:57:26.502 --> 02:57:28.971
DARK OF NIGHT AND THEN RUN AND

02:57:29.038 --> 02:57:29.572
HIDE AND SAY WELL I'M NOT IN A

02:57:29.638 --> 02:57:31.841
GAME. IF YOU'RE IN A GANG IN

02:57:31.907 --> 02:57:34.777
YOUR ACTIVE. YOU'RE PROUD

02:57:34.844 --> 02:57:36.645
THAT'S PART OF YOUR BRAND.

02:57:36.712 --> 02:57:39.482
REGARDLESS OF IF IT'S GOOD TO

02:57:39.548 --> 02:57:40.082
BE IN AGAIN I'M NOT DISPUTING

02:57:40.149 --> 02:57:42.618
THAT. BUT FOLKS DON'T PRETEND

02:57:42.685 --> 02:57:43.753
LIKE THEY'RE IN A GANG AND THEN

02:57:43.819 --> 02:57:44.754
DON'T PRETEND LIKE THEY'RE IN A

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:46.689
GAME BECAUSE IF YOU'RE DOING IT

02:57:46.756 --> 02:57:48.457
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ONE FOR YOUR

02:57:48.524 --> 02:57:50.693
FINANCIAL GAME. FOR EXPANSION

02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:52.294
OF TERRITORY DID YOU WANT

02:57:52.361 --> 02:57:53.963
PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT IN WHICH

02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:56.098
CASE IT SHOULD BE PRETTY EASY

02:57:56.165 --> 02:57:58.834
TO PROVE. IT SHOULD BE PRETTY

02:57:58.901 --> 02:58:02.171
EASY TO PROVE. AB THREE THREE

02:58:02.238 --> 02:58:05.007
THREE SAYS IF YOU TELL SOMEONE

02:58:05.074 --> 02:58:10.446
THE CASE. WITH ONE TO PROCESS

02:58:10.513 --> 02:58:12.148
IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT A FAIR

02:58:12.214 --> 02:58:14.150
TRIAL SHOULD BE ABOUT. THAT'S

02:58:14.216 --> 02:58:16.919
WHAT THE COURT OF LAW. SO WE

02:58:16.986 --> 02:58:21.090
SHOULD BE DOING. PEOPLE CREATE

02:58:21.157 --> 02:58:23.726
WILL DO BAD THINGS GANG MEMBERS

02:58:23.793 --> 02:58:27.396
DO BAD THINGS. THEY DO ENGAGE

02:58:27.463 --> 02:58:30.800
IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AND IF

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:31.400
THEY ARE CAUGHT THEY SHOULD BE

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:37.373
CHARGED. YOU CAN PROVE IT YOU

02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:42.411
HAVE EVIDENCE SO FAR. THAT'S

02:58:42.478 --> 02:58:46.215
WHAT THIS BILL SAYS THAT'S WHAT

02:58:46.282 --> 02:58:49.785
THIS BILL WILL STILL ALLOW. AND

02:58:49.852 --> 02:58:51.821
FOR ANYONE TO TELL YOU THAT

02:58:51.887 --> 02:58:52.421
THIS IS A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE

02:58:52.488 --> 02:58:55.458
CARD. EITHER DOESN'T KNOW THE

02:58:55.524 --> 02:58:58.461
LAW. OR IS TRYING TO SCARE YOU.

02:58:58.527 --> 02:59:00.062
AND THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS IT

02:59:00.129 --> 02:59:02.498
IS SO INCREDIBLY EASY TO SCARE

02:59:02.565 --> 02:59:07.470
YOU WHEN YOU SAY THE WORD GANG.

02:59:07.536 --> 02:59:09.438
I COME FROM A COMMUNITY WHERE A

02:59:09.505 --> 02:59:12.108
FAMILY MEMBER. WAS SHOT DEAD IN

02:59:12.174 --> 02:59:13.109
THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND

02:59:13.175 --> 02:59:17.012
LEFT TO DIE IN HIS LIVING ROOM

BLOOD OUT FOR TEN HOURS. GANG

02:59:19.715 --> 02:59:24.120
INVOLVEMENT. I WOULD NOT WANT

02:59:24.186 --> 02:59:26.222
TO PASS A BILL THAT WOULD SAVE

02:59:26.288 --> 02:59:30.726
HIS LIFE IS FORGOTTEN. BUT EVEN

02:59:30.793 --> 02:59:33.596
THAT PERSON WHO DID THAT.

02:59:33.662 --> 02:59:36.065
DESERVES A FAIR TRIAL. THAT'S

02:59:36.132 --> 02:59:38.601
WHAT THE COURT IS ABOUT THAT'S

02:59:38.667 --> 02:59:41.003
WHAT THE LAW IS ABOUT. LAWYERS

02:59:41.070 --> 02:59:43.339
GO INTO BATTLE WITH THE

02:59:43.405 --> 02:59:46.208
EVIDENCE TO PROVE THEIR CASE.

02:59:46.275 --> 02:59:47.977
AND IF YOU ARE GOOD AND

02:59:48.043 --> 02:59:53.482
STRATEGIC YOU WILL WIN. IN LOS

03:03:56.492 --> 03:03:58.327
AND NON URGENT AND NON GENDERED

03:03:58.394 --> 03:04:00.529
WAYS- THE ADDITIONAL GENDER

03:04:00.596 --> 03:04:02.030
NEUTRAL SECTION WILL NOT BE

03:04:02.097 --> 03:04:04.066
NECESSARY IN OTHER WORDS IF THE

SECTIONS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS. HI

03:04:11.673 --> 03:04:12.574
THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHEN THE

STATE DECIDED TO ADD GENDER

03:04:14.009 --> 03:04:16.245
NEUTRAL BATHROOMS- WERE

03:04:16.311 --> 03:04:18.347
NECESSARY TO ADOPT WHAT SOCIETY

03:04:18.414 --> 03:04:20.416
NEEDS TO BE FUNCTIONAL-

03:04:20.482 --> 03:04:22.518
INCLUSIVE. IN TODAY'S CULTURE

03:04:22.584 --> 03:04:23.652
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STOP

03:04:23.719 --> 03:04:25.354
REINFORCING GENDER NORMS THAT

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:27.289
CAN BE HARMFUL TO CHILDREN.

03:04:27.356 --> 03:04:29.024
THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT APPLY

03:04:29.091 --> 03:04:31.226

03:04:33.295 --> 03:04:35.063
HOPEFULLY LESSEN AT SOME POINT

03:04:35.130 --> 03:04:37.032
IN THE NEAR FUTURE- AND KIDS

03:04:37.099 --> 03:04:38.600
START GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AS

03:04:38.667 --> 03:04:40.436
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IN RECENT

03:04:40.502 --> 03:04:42.404
WEEKS AND WE'LL SEE MORE AND

03:04:42.471 --> 03:04:44.006
MORE ACTIVITY- WE WANT THE

03:04:44.072 --> 03:04:45.641
PROCESS OF SHOPPING TO BE A

03:04:45.707 --> 03:04:48.577
POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. AFTER THIS

03:04:48.644 --> 03:04:50.245
UNPRECEDENTED YEAR OF STRESS-

03:04:50.312 --> 03:04:51.547
WERE WANNA CREATE A WELCOMING

03:04:51.613 --> 03:04:54.049
PLACE FOR ALL CHILDREN- MOVING

03:04:54.116 --> 03:04:56.118
AWAY FROM STEREOTYPES LIKE BLUE

03:04:56.185 --> 03:04:57.986
IS FOR BOYS AND PINK IS FOR

03:04:58.053 --> 03:05:01.857
GIRLS- THE DAUGHTER OF. A

03:05:01.924 --> 03:05:03.692
DAUGHTER OF THE ALTAR STAFF WAS

03:05:03.759 --> 03:05:04.460
WALKING THROUGH THE PARK AND

03:05:04.526 --> 03:05:07.029

KNOW YOU WILL LET ME SHOP AND

03:05:08.397 --> 03:05:09.431
THE BOYS DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I

03:05:09.498 --> 03:05:11.400
LIKE GREENS AND BLUE BETTER

03:05:11.467 --> 03:05:13.335
THAN SPARKLES HOWEVER I'VE

03:05:13.402 --> 03:05:14.703
ASKED KIDS IN MY CLASS AND THEY

03:05:14.770 --> 03:05:16.772
ALL WANT. TO AS WELL BUT SOME

03:05:16.839 --> 03:05:18.841
OF THEIR PARENTS SAY NO BECAUSE

03:05:18.907 --> 03:05:20.042
OF THE WAY THE SECTION IS

03:05:20.108 --> 03:05:22.010
LABELED FOR BOYS AND GIRLS AND

03:05:22.077 --> 03:05:23.712

03:05:23.779 --> 03:05:25.647
SPACE CITY SPACES FOR ALL

03:05:31.286 --> 03:05:32.254

CHILD GOES INTO A LARGER STORE

03:05:35.357 --> 03:05:37.159
WITH A CARETAKER OUR HOPE IS

03:05:37.226 --> 03:05:39.795
THAT THE DOOR WILL BE BIASED BY

03:05:39.862 --> 03:05:40.395

03:05:46.068 --> 03:05:47.636
WANTS. AND IF A BOY WANTS A

03:05:47.703 --> 03:05:48.837

APARTMENT OR VICE VERSA.

03:05:50.372 --> 03:05:51.340
THERE'S OFTEN A STIGMA

03:05:51.406 --> 03:05:52.941
ASSOCIATED THAT MAKES THE CHILD

03:05:53.008 --> 03:05:55.143
FEEL JUDGED WERE UNABLE TO

03:05:55.210 --> 03:05:57.012

EITHER FOR GIRLS OR FOR BOYS.

03:06:04.820 --> 03:06:06.255
MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE

03:06:06.321 --> 03:06:08.123
CONSUMER TO COMPARE PRODUCTS.

03:06:08.190 --> 03:06:11.460

03:06:26.975 --> 03:06:29.344
FALL I'M SIMPLY PUT. HOW ABOUT

03:06:29.411 --> 03:06:31.313
WE LET KIDS BE KIDS I'M NOT

03:06:31.380 --> 03:06:33.815
GONNA BE WHO THEY ARE. I

03:06:33.882 --> 03:06:35.784
RESPECT FILES FOR AN IPO. ANY

YOU- I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO

03:06:49.565 --> 03:06:51.833
THIS BILL AND I WOULD RECOMMEND

03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:54.736
THAT WE LET PARENTS BE PARENTS

03:06:54.803 --> 03:06:55.837
AND MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT

03:06:55.904 --> 03:06:57.172
THEY WANT TO MAKE FOR THEIR

03:06:57.239 --> 03:06:59.808
KIDS ALONG WITH THEIR CHILDREN-

03:06:59.875 --> 03:07:01.810
UNLIKE THE AUTHOR I ACTUALLY

03:07:01.877 --> 03:07:04.413

BE EXACT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT

03:07:05.814 --> 03:07:07.916
IS. VERY CONVENIENT FOR PARENTS

03:07:07.983 --> 03:07:09.851
WHEN THEY'RE SHOPPING TO KNOW

03:07:09.918 --> 03:07:12.454
WHERE THE CLOTHING IS FOR THEIR

03:07:12.521 --> 03:07:14.323
CHILD WHETHER IT'S A BOY OR

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:17.159
GIRL AN APPARENT ALREADY KNOWS

03:07:17.225 --> 03:07:19.528
WHAT THEIR CHILD'S PREFERENCES

03:07:19.595 --> 03:07:20.963
IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHERE IN THE

03:07:21.029 --> 03:07:22.664
STORE PUTS IT OR THAT THEY MAKE

03:07:22.731 --> 03:07:24.266
IT GENDER NEUTRAL THE PARENT

03:07:24.333 --> 03:07:25.968
ALREADY KNOWS THIS MY GOODNESS

03:07:26.034 --> 03:07:27.669
PARKING IS- PARENTS DON'T KNOW

03:07:27.736 --> 03:07:30.205
THEIR OWN CHILDREN. AND AS

03:07:30.272 --> 03:07:33.041

03:07:40.148 --> 03:07:42.017
DECISIONS BASED ON THE INPUT.

03:07:42.084 --> 03:07:42.918
THEY GET FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS

03:07:42.985 --> 03:07:45.120
BUT I DON'T THINK. THAT PARENTS

03:07:45.187 --> 03:07:47.089
NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN

03:07:47.155 --> 03:07:49.358
AND TELL THEM. HOW THEY SHOULD

03:07:49.424 --> 03:07:51.460
