PROCESSED BY SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED ANY MOMENTS THIS BILL TODAY BUT WE WANT TO WELCOME YOU HERE TODAY SENATOR GROW AND PLEASE PRESENT YOUR BILL WHEN. THANK YOU MEDICARE HACKETT AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND I'M SURE I APPRECIATE YOU LETTING ME PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THINKING AND THE TEAR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS -- AND I GAVE THE CHAIR MY WORD THAT I WOULD ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS TOMORROW JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT WOULD DELETE SECTIONS ONE AND FOUR PERTAINING TO THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION. AND THE P. R. A. SECTIONS OF MY BILL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY -- SHOULD THE BILL ADVANCE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ARE CASH TO ADDRESS THE REMAINING CONCERNS THAT ARE TO HAS ON THE BILL. I'VE BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR THE DISABILITY AN INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITIES IN SIZE IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND AND WHEN THE DISABILITY UNITED OR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED APPROACH ME ABOUT INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE STATE'S TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS. I WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO INTRODUCE THIS BILL. SB SIX EIGHTY THREE WILL HELP ADDRESS MORE CONSUMER ACCESS INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET FOR PROVIDING DATA. IN IN MACHINE. READABLE FORMAT FOR THE REGIONAL MACHINE READABLE DATA MAKES INFORMATION MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS AND ANALYZE -- WHICH DIMINISHES THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO CONFORM WITH THE WEBSITE TO STANDARDIZE FORMAT. AND IT'LL ALSO HELP WITH UNIFORMITY BETWEEN THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE CONSUMERS TO THE CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS CAN EASILY ACCESS A INFORMATION IS MADE PUBLIC. THERE HAVE BEEN A LONG STANDING CONCERNS AMONG CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS REGARDING THE REGIONAL CENTERS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND HOW BOTH MIGHT BE IMPROVED SB SIX EIGHTY THREE WILL HELP. ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND WILL HELP. AND AND WILL HELP MOVE WITH THE DISABILITY AND DEVELOPMENTAL AT SYSTEM TO STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH ME TO TAKE TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX EIGHTY THREE IS ALISON MARANTZ REPRESENTING THE SPONSOR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE -- MY NAME IS ALLISON MARANTZ -- I AM A LAW PROFESSOR AT STANFORD AND ALSO THE MOTHER OF A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS SIR BY SAN ANDREAS REGIONAL CENTER -- AND I AM HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED -- FOR WHICH I AM A BOARD MEMBER -- SO I WERE A NUMBER OF HATS AND I WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THEM TODAY IN MY REMARKS -- NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN PERRANCE -- V. CRITICAL AND CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS OUR TO WHICH YOU KNOW YOU OR YOUR CHILD OR IF YOU'RE ITSELF ADVOCATE TO WHICH YOU CAN YOU ARE ARE -- THEORETICALLY ABLE TO ACCESS THEN THERE'S NO WAY IN PRACTICE TO HOLD YOUR REGIONAL CENTER ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. SO THE FOCUS OF THE PROVISIONS OF TODAY'S BILL THAT I'M GONNA FOCUS FOCUS ON HAVE TO DO WITH TURNING THE THEORY OF TRANSPARENCY INTO THE PRACTICE OF TRANSPARENCY. BY WHICH I MEAN WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DISCLOSURES NOW THAT THAT HAVE EEN MANDATED OVER THE YEARS I CAN GROW UP TO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE NOW. MORE THAN HALF OF WHICH ARE NUMERIC HEY NATURE. HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING SPENT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING SERVED -- AND WE HAVE. TO REALLY FESTERING AND AND AND REALLY MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH I'M TRANSPARENCY. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THESE IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES THE FIRST PROBLEM IS. EVERY REGIONAL CENTER CAN DECIDE FOR ITSELF WHERE THEY PLACE THAT INFORMATION ON ITS WEBSITE. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND A GIVEN DISCLOSURE IS LIKE GOING ON TWENTY ONE INDIVIDUAL SCAVENGER HUNTS. ON TWENTY ONE WEBSITE. I'M IN MY CAPACITY AS A LAW PROFESSOR AT STANFORD I HIRED -- TO TOP RESEARCH FELLOWS WHO ARE SKILLED IN DATA SCIENCE IT TOOK THEM TWO WEEKS TO GO THROUGH THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS. AND IDENTIFY EACH OF THE MANDATORY WEB BASED DISCLOSURES -- AND THEY CLASSIFY THE ABOUT HOW HARD THEY WERE TO FIND IN A NUMBER OF THEM WERE EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND SOME OF THEM WE STILL CAN'T FIND -- AND REMEMBER THESE ARE DISCLOSURES THAT CONSUMERS AND OTHER ADVOCATES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS READILY IF THEY CAN'T ACCESS THEM IN THE SYSTEM IS TRANSPARENT ONLY IN NAME WITH REGARD TO THAT PARTICULAR TRANSPARENT THAT PARTICULAR DISCLOSURE. SO THE UNIFORMITY PROVISION IS CRITICAL SO THAT ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING CAN GET ON TWENTY ONE WEBSITES. AND READILY ACCESSIBLE PIECE OF INFORMATION THEY NEED -- THE SECOND IMPORTANT -- PIECE WE DISCUSSED IS THE MACHINE READABLE FORMAT SO SO THINK OF A PDF VERSES AN EXCEL FILE. RIGHT A MANSION DOZENS OR HUNDREDS OF NUMBERS IN A PDF -- DOCUMENT THE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY TRANSCRIBED BY HAND INDIVIDUALLY TO IT TO MAKE ANY SENSE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON SYSTEMICALLY. RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE STATUS QUO ESSENTIALLY NO INFORMATION THAT'S AMERICAN NATURE PRODUCED BY DDS OR OUR REGIONAL CENTERS IS PROVIDED NOW IN MACHINE READABLE FORMAT. SO THERE'S NO WAY TO DOWNLOAD INTO AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET TO MAKE COMPARISONS YOU HAVE TO LIKE LITERALLY YOU KNOW HAND ENTER IT WHICH IS. FOR HIM TO BE TIME CONSUMING FOR PRETTY MUCH ANYBODY. SO THE MACHINE READABLE FORMAT PEAS HAS BECOME THE NORM ON THE FEDERAL SIDE IT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE OPEN GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT THIS CONTEXT BECAUSE OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SYSTEM TO ACCESS THE STATE RIGHT NOW SO BOTH OF THESE. PIECES OF THE CERTAINLY NOT EVERYTHING WE HAVE HOPE FOR WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MOVE THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD. AND MAKE SURE THAT LEAVES VIEWS TWO PIECES CAN BECOME PART OF OUR STATUS QUO. THANK YOU I'M DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL [inaudible] XENA OKAY. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE. WELL THAT THE LAST OF THAT BEFORE. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- NOT ONLY OF WHAT SUPPORT THIS BILL. I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT.

I THINK THE TRANSPARENCY IMPORTANT I HOPE THAT -- REGIONAL CENTERS. CAN WORK WITH CENTER GROVE ON TRANSPARENCY -- I SUPPORT. THE BILL I'M GONNA VOTE FOR TODAY -- I A WANT TO EXPRESS THE CONCERN ABOUT. THE ISSUE OF THE PROCESS FOR TRANSPARENCY AND THE PROCESS HAS TO BE. FAIR FOR A SINGLE MOTHER WITH THREE OR FOUR KIDS. THAT'S THAT CAN'T SPEAKS SPEAK -- ENGLISH AND WHAT IT HAS -- DOWN SYNDROME KID. TO GET FAIR TREATMENT EQUAL TO AN ATTORNEY FROM STANFORD. AND PALO ALTO SO I THINK THE THE WHOLE PROCESS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY HAS TO BE OF EQUAL? FOR BOTH BECAUSE OF A LOT OF TIMES IN THE GRAMS IN ESPECIALLY IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. FOR KIDS THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IT'S THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE THE GREECE IF YOU WANT TO SET THAT WAY AND I THINK -- I DON'T KNOW HOW THE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WILL APPROACH THIS BILL BUT TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE BUT IT HAS TO BE TRANSPARENT FOR EVERYONE. IN ALL FAMILIES. AND THERE'S A LOT OF KIDS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BECAUSE THE FAMILIES ARE AFRAID -- TO AFRAID -- TO HAVE THEIR KIDS SIGNED UP -- FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAMS AND BE ELIGIBLE FOR REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAMS. OF BECAUSE OF VARIOUS IMMIGRATION STATUS OF THE MONEY I ONE FAMILY MEMBER. THAT HAS THE WRONG IMMIGRATION STATUS SO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE. TO AND A LOT OF TIMES OF THE KIDS THAT DON'T GET FAIR SERVICE OKAY. AND I KNOW THIS IS TRUE -- SO I WANT TO EXPRESS THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AFTER OF THAT ASPECT OF? TRANSPARENCY COVERED IN THE BILL. AND I'LL JUST SAY THIS -- CENTER GROVE IN AND I HAVE WORKED LONG AND HARD. FOR PROGRAMS FOR DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN I WAS A COLLEAGUE. AND SO I SUPPORT THE BILL BUT BUT I THINK WE HAVE. TO WE HAVE TO WORK ON THIS EQUITY. FAIRNESS -- FOR ALL RIGHT FOR ALL FAMILIES WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT OTHERS WAS A THREE HUNDRED THIRTY KIDS THAT -- I HAVE -- ELIGIBILITY IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PROGRAM TO CALIFORNIA THREE ON THREE THOUSAND THERE ARE PROBABLY. THOUSANDS MORE. THAT HAVE ELIGIBILITY THAT JUST TALENT. GOT THE SERVICES. SO THAT'S GOING TO THAT'S AN ISSUE I THINK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND I WANT TO REGIONAL SERVICETO THINK ABOUT THIS OF WAYS WE CAN. SOLVE THIS DILEMMA AS WELL SO -- AND AS EVERYBODY KNOWS I AM -- MY DADDY TO ASSEMBLY AS DEVELOP A DISABLED. SO I'M AWARE HOW IT WORKS. IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS MEMBERS [inaudible] OKAY.

SIX FOURTEEN THIS LEGISLATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE DESPITE THE CONSISTENT EFFORTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE OVER SEVERAL YEARS WE STILL SEE GAPS IN ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE STATE ESPECIALLY REGARDING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

IN THE LAST COMMITTEE -- SP ONE SIXTY THREE ALLOWS CALIFORNIA'S WITH AUTISM TO RECEIVE COVERAGE FOR TREATMENT PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN. OR PSYCHOLOGIST TO KNOW THEM BEST NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TREATMENT THAT MAY NOT FIT THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. THE BILL ADDRESSES ROADBLOCKS TO COVERAGE FOR PARENTS WHO FOR WORK REASONS ARE FOR FAMILY PRESSURES CANNOT FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR CHILD'S THERAPY SESSION. OR WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE TO RECEIVE SERVICES AT ARE NOT A SCHOOL OR DAYCARE SETTING. THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM ACROSS THE STATE -- WE HAVE RECEIVED OVER TWO HUNDRED LETTERS FROM PARENTS AND SUPPORT AS WELL AS FROM NUMEROUS AUTISM ORGANIZATIONS AND PROFESSIONALS -- TO MAKE TODAY I HAVE JIM LANDRY ON THE D. I. R. FOR TIME COALITION TO PRESENT TESTIMONY ON ITS BEHALF MISTER ANDREW. THANK YOU SENATOR. THIS IS A TWENTY YEAR STRUGGLE -- SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHEN WE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT HADN'T SAID THAT AUTISM SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME AS PHYSICAL AILMENTS -- THE STRUGGLE HAS BEEN FROM BOTH THE REGULATORS SIDE AND THE LEGISLATIVE SIDE TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT. CHILDREN AS WELL AS ADULTSIN THE STATE RECEIVE TREATMENT OF FOR AUTISM COVERED BY THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT THEY PAID -- FOR IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THEY RECEIVE COVERAGE FOR PHYSICAL AILMENTS -- WE'VE PASSED NUMEROUS LAWS WITH CUSTOMERS Là REGULATIONS AND NUMEROUS LAWSUITS -- UNFORTUNATELY -- THE INSURANCE COMPANIES -- THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE BEEN KICKING AND DRAGGING THEIR FEET AND NOW WE FIND OURSELVES TO THE POINT WHERE HOPEFULLY WE CAN FINALLY PUT THAT TO REST AND CHILDREN AND ADULTS CAN GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. WRITER JURAI VOTE THANK YOU. GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE SIXTY THREE PLEASE COME FORWARD. CNN IS ANYONE OPPOSED SB ONE SIXTY THREE PLEASE COME FORWARD. WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM TABLE. BECAUSE IT IN THE MIDDLE ACTUALLY IT LOOKS. PREFERRED LEAVE HE TABLE SPOTS FOR THOSE AN ACTUAL OPPOSITION. AT DANIEL'S AVEENO ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES OUR POSITION IS CONCERNS AT THIS POINT. AND OUR CONCERN IS QUITE SIMPLY BASED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT WHATEVER SKILLS ARE LEARNED. IN THESE SETTINGS CAN BE GENERALIZED TO THE HOME AND COMMUNITY. AND IF PARENTS CAN PARTICIPATE WE RECOGNIZE THAT'S A CHALLENGE SO WE'D LOVE TO SEE A WAY IN WHICH SHOWS THE SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE WAY FOR THESE. LESSONS WE BROUGHT OUT OF THIS CLINICAL SETTING A WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORED SPONSORS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY. PLEASE. TO FOR I THANK YOU AYE MICHELLE HI ADAM A BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS REPRESENTING THAT CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM FOR APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS I'M SORRY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. OR CURRENTLY SERVE AS A VICE CHAIR PUBLIC POLICY. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO ENSURING ACCESS TO QUALITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY HASN'T OPPOSE POSITION BUT WE'RE OPTIMISTIC WE CAN ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WITH CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE LANGUAGE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE BILL. OUR CONCERNS ARE THAT CURRENT LANGUAGE INCLUDED IN SB ONE SIXTY THREE HAS NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AS WRITTEN THE BILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERS THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR PRACTITIONER SERVING A VULNERABLE POPULATION. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT MINIMUM STANDARDS TO PRACTICE COMPETENTLY. CONSUMERS WILL BE AT INCREASING RISK OF ROSEN OF QUALITY OF SERVICE. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BILL WOULD PLACE IN STATUTE AN ALTERNATE SET OF STANDARDS FOR ABA PROFESSIONALS. THAT DO NOT ALIGN WITH THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED FOR A BE A CERTIFICATION BY THE BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS CERTIFICATION BOARD. WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED IN THE MANDATE AND IS THE ONLY ACCREDITED CERTIFICATION THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR THE PROVIDER LEVEL. HELLO I WAS CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL CREATE CONFUSION IN THE MARKETPLACE BY MIXING REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT THE PROFESSIONAL PROVIDER PIPELINE WHICH WOULD CREATE SERIOUS ACCESS ISSUES. HOWEVER HAS REQUESTED CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH LANGUAGE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE BILL RE REQUEST CLARIFICATION ON THE REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROVIDERS. THIS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS SERVICES FROM OTHER QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROVIDERS. WHO PROVIDE OTHER EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS LAST YEAR AMENDMENTS WERE ACCEPTED WHICH SEPARATE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A BE A PARA PROFESSIONALS? FROM NINE A. B. A. PARA PROFESSIONALS AND CALIBER HAS OFFERED LANGUAGE CONSISTENT WITH THIS REQUEST THAT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT OF THE BILL BUT SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS THEY ARE SEEKING. DO NOT APPLY TO ABA PROVIDERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT LEAD TO AMENDMENTS. AND WHICH WILL ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS THOUGHT TO THE OTHER DEVELOPING OF DISABILITIES THEY GIVE JUST MONEY. NEXT PLEASE A GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JENNIFER ALI WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS -- AND AT WE APPRECIATE THE TIME TO DISCUSS THIS BILL AGAIN WITHOUT MOST OF YOU CAN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT -- CAPS MEMBER HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY PROVIDE. MEDICAL IMPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS SERVICES TO THEIR ENROLLEES WITH AUTISM -- SB NINE FORTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN MOVED AUTISM COVERAGE FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO HEALTH PLAN COVERAGE. AND WE ALSO HAVE REQUIREMENTS THAT -- BUYER REGULATORS TO REQUIRE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE NETWORKS FOR ORAL LEASE TO ACCESS CARE -- AND SINCE THAT TIME -- AUTISM SERVICES HAVE BEEN A PART -- INCLUDED AS AN ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT -- SO AS PREVIOUSLY STATED BY CALLIE PA THIS BILL DOES IN OUR OPINION WATER DOWN THE TREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVIDERS FOR THIS FAIRY I. NEEDY POPULATION OF THAT -- CAUSES SOME CONCERNS FOR US -- YOU KNOW GENERALLY SPEAKING HEALTH PLANS RELY ON LICENSED -- PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE CARE TO THEIR ENROLLEES IN THIS IS A DISEASE GROUP THAT DOESN'T HAVE SPECIFIC LICENSING CATEGORY -- TO PROVIDE TREATMENT -- SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WE HAVE PROVIDERS ARE CERTIFIED BY PORTS BUT NOT NECESSARILY LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WATERING DOWN THE PROVIDER REQUIREMENTS ON THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN STATUTE THAT WOULD INTO PLACE LAST YEAR THAT CAUSES SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS FOR MY MEMBERS -- AND I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF CLEAR -- FIVE YOU KNOW IN CLOSING YOU KNOW -- THERE ARE A LOT OF BILLS THAT CHANGE HOW HEALTHCARE COVERAGE -- IS IS COVERED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR AND SO AS WE LOOK AT CHANGING REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT HEALTH PLANS COVERAGE WE DO HAVE. SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THOSE CHANGES IN THE ADDED COST OUR MEMBERS THANK YOU WILL ALLOW FOR ONE MORE COMPREHENSIVE OPPOSITION AND THE REST WILL BE JUST NAME AND WHETHER YOU'RE SUPPORTER OPPOSE THE BILL. SEVENTY WALKEN'S ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH ECHO THAT PREVIOUS COMMENTS AND ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU.

YES THANK YOU -- AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I THINK SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT. ARE POINTED TO THE BILL'S DEFICIENCIES ARE ACTUALLY WHAT MAKES THE BILL STRONG AS IT ALLOWS. DOCTORS TO PROVIDE.

SECTION ONE OF SB ONE SEVEN TWO AN AXE WE KEEP OUR SENIOR SAY FACT AND WE'RE REQUIRE REGULATE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR FIREARMS AND AMMUNITIONS. WITH THE IN A RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY WHEN THE FACILITY ALLOWS RESIDENTS TO HAVE GUNS AND AMMUNITION. THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE FACILITIES TO ACCEPT AMMUNITION OR FIREARMS BUT IF THEY CHOOSE TO ALLOW THIS WE WANT PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO PROTECT RESIDENTS AND STAFF. THIS IS A VULNERABLE POPULATION AND AS SUCH WE WANT TO HAVE THESE LAYERS OF PROTECTION IN. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE A SYSTEM. THAT PROTECTS THE RESIDENTS STAFF AND VISITORS FOR ENSURING ULTIMATE SAFETY YOU MA'AM AND SIMPLIFY THE INSPECTION PROCESS FOR WEAPONS. IN THESE FACILITIES WE HAVE AGREED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE SPONSORED THE DEPARTMENT IN THE COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP A TRANSPARENCY POLICY. APPLE PROVIDE NOTICE TO RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHEN THERE ARE FIREARMS PRESENT PERMITTED IN ONE OF THESE FACILITIES.

SOMETHING GOOD MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING DOLLARS CALIFORNIA -- IN IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. NOT BECAUSE WE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT -- PROTECTION SHOULD BE IN PLACE AS A MATTER OF FACT IN TALKING WITH OUR ATTORNEYS AND ACTUALLY TALKING TO SOME FACILITIES. UP FACILITIES THEMSELVES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PRIVATE CONTRACT A PRIVATE SET OF RULES AND REGULATIONS AS TO WHAT IS ACCEPTED AND WHAT IS NOT AND HOW TO HANDLE ALL OF THESE ISSUES. ALLTHE TRANSFER ALL OF THE REMOVAL ALL OUR STUFF IS ALREADY COVERED BY LAW. HOW THAT ALL HAPPENS BUT A FACILITY CAN ACTUALLY HAS -- AS A AS A CONDITION OF BEING A RESIDENT THERE HOW DO I KNOW. MY FATHER IN LAW CENTER HR RICHARDSON IS A RESIDENT OF ONE OF THESE FACILITIES HE IS THE ARGUABLY THE GODFATHER THE SECOND MEMON STATE CALIFORNIA -- AN END YET IT'S IT'S WILL BE NOT OKAY FOR HIM TO HAVE FARMS RIGHT NOW. BUT THAT'S THE SITUATION THAT'S REGULATED WITH THE WITH THE FACILITY AND IT'S WORKING OUT FINE -- WE HEARD ABOUT THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE AT SOME OF THESE FACILITIES WE ARE UNAWARE OF THIS BEING ANY SORT OF REAL PROBLEM. AND WE DIDN'T SEE THAT DSS WAS ONE WAS BRINING BRING IN THIS ISSUE BUT OTHER FOLKS WHO WHO WHO HAD CONCERN OVER THIS. PHONE FOR THESE REASONS AND AND THE FACT THAT. A COOKIE CUTTER RESPONSE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. USUALLY NEVER HELPS EVERYBODY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND WE WOULD NATURALLY FLOW SO STATION ALSO HERE FOR CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION AS WELL. A MALL ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CREDIT IS -- WE FEEL THIS ONE'S ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS IS AN APPROPRIATE IT'S IF YOU. AND WE'RE STILL DIGESTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED THE ANALYSIS HERE -- BUT BASED ON THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IT DISCOURAGES FROM FACILITIES FROM TAKING AND FARMS BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITIES. AND THE PROCEDURE AS YOU SEE FIREARM HAVE TO BE SEPARATED FROM AMMUNITION WITH FIRING PENS EXTRACTED EXCEDRIN FOR PHOTOGRAPHS AND AND WHATNOT SO -- LIKE I SAID WE'RE STILL GONNA DIE JUST AS AMENDMENTS BUT WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS JUST REALLY DISCOURAGING PRESIDENT'S COMING ABLE TO TO KEEP HER ARMS SIR THANK YOU FOR JUST ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CAPPING LUNCH REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION SAFARI CLUB. INTERNATIONAL SPORTSMEN'S COALITION WE'RE ALL IN OPPOSITION BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER AGAIN WE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- WHEN PEOPLE ALSO MOVE FROM THESE FACILITIES THERE'S ALSO STEP DOWN TO DIFFERENT PLACES THAT THEY GO THIS CAN CREATE SOME A LEGAL QUAGMIRE -- FOR THE THE FAMILIES IT CAN ALSO BE A PROBLEM IF UPON. THEIR DEATH ON THE TRANSFER INTO IN THE STATE SO WHAT KIND OF CREATING A REAL STICKY WICKET HERE AND OUR OPPOSITION WAS ORIGINALLY BASED ON THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL I KNOW WE'RE JUST FOCUSED ON THESE AMENDMENTS TODAY.

SIX NINETY FIVE WE ARE THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB SIX NINETY FIVE WHICH WILL AUTHORIZES. TO MEET UP 25% OF ITS SHARE OF REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS BY ADOPTING A PROGRAM. THAT VOLUNTARY PROGRAM THAT PROMOTES AND ASSIST IN THE PLACEMENT OF FOSTER YOUTH. IN EXISTING FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE NOT BUILDING HOUSES BUT THIS BILL WERE BUILDING HOMES AND I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- SB SIX NINETY FIVE ALLOWS A CITY TO DEEM A HOUSING UNIT PARTICIPATING IN A HOME SHARING ARRANGEMENT ALSO -- HOME SHARING ARRANGEMENT WITH AT LEAST ONE LOW MODERATE INCOME SENIOR OR DISABLED OCCUPANT IS A VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING ITS REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS -- SINCE THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PROCESS DOES NOT PLAN FOR FORTUNE POPULATIONS OF FOSTER YOUTH IN NEED. OF IMMEDIATE AND FUTURE HOUSING FLEXIBILITY IS NEEDED BOTH THE PLAN AND FOR PHIL THE STATE'S RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITY OF FIND QUALITY FOSTER HOMES. OF FINDING A HOME FOR FOSTER YOUTH IS ESSENTIAL FOR THESE CHILDREN HAS OUTCOMES FOR THOSE WHO AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE OFTEN FRANKLY GRAHAM. COMPARED TO THOSE WHO EXIT EXIT THE SYSTEM WITH A PERMANENT LINKS TO A CARING ADULT OR FAMILY COURT IN THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER CALIFORNIA ONE THIRD OF YOUTH WHO AGE OUT OF FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. SHOW EVIDENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THE MOST PREVALENT DIAGNOSIS BEING P. T. S. D. ALCOHOL OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND DEPRESSION. LIKEWISE THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S WHITE RIGHTS FOUND THAT HALF OF YOUNG ADULTS WHO H. OUT OF FOSTER CARE AND UP HOMELESS OR EVEN INCARCERATED. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR CITIES -- YOU KNOW I HAVE THIS. NOTION THAT ECHOES BACK TEN YEARS WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT IF WE COULD CREATE. NONTRADITIONAL FAMILY BONDS AND PLACE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THOSE HOMES THOSE CONNECTIONS CAN CARRY FORWARD AFTER. EMANCIPATION AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE TRYING TO FIND SOME. LOCALLY BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO JUST SEE IF WE CAN VOLUNTARILY PLACE FOSTER YOUTH I MEAN I KNOW MISTER BELL HAS WORKED HIS ENTIRE. LEGISLATIVE AND AND COUNTY SUPERVISORIAL CAREER IN TRYING TO HELP. THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT. TAKING ON AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE IN A NEGATIVE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN A NEGATIVE WAY IT'S NOT. IT'S JUST A SMALL. IN ESSENCE PILOT PROJECT TO CREATE A LOCALLY DRIVEN VOLUNTARY INCENTIVE. THE PUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN HOMES I KNOW IT DOESN'T BUILD A NEW HOME. BUT GOD THESE ARE KIDS WHO. DESPERATELY NEED. A PLACE TO SLEEP A PLACE TO STAY AND A FAMILY THAT'S GONNA LOVE THEM AND CARE FOR THEM AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASTRONAUT. THANK YOU SENATOR TOM CALL UPON THOSE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX NINETY FIVE IF YOU CAN COME FORWARD PLEASE. THOSE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY IN OPPOSITION SB SIX NINETY FIVE PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN AUGUSTA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. OUR ORGANIZATION ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT WESTERN CENTER -- REGRETTABLY GOVERNMENT REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE -- NOT SURE HOW ARE OPPOSITION DIDN'T GET REFLECTED AND PERHAPS -- THERE IS A DISCONNECT AND SENDING A LETTER BUT OUR HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND I KNOW HE'S AWARE OF OUR CONCERNS AS WELL -- JUST WANNA REITERATE THOSE CONCERNS HERE TODAY. THE FIRST IS THERE'S NO QUESTION A MISS PORTANTINO IS PASSIONATE ABOUT -- FOSTER CARE PLACEMENTS AND WE AGREE WITH HIM THAT WE NEED. TO ACHIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES THERE AND WE LOVE TO FIND A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO THAT. WE DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS THE SYSTEM TO DO THAT I THINK NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF REDUCING PLANNING FOR HOUSING. FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS GENERALLY -- BY REDUCING THE CITY'S OBLIGATION TO PLAN BY REDUCING ARENA. BUT IT ALSO AND SOME OF THIS IS ALSO NOTED BY AT THE END OF THE ANALYSIS IS JUST A LOT OF INCONGRUENT. ARE ELEMENTS TO THIS BILL INCIDENTS DON'T SEEM TO BE CORRECT WHAT IT WHAT ABOUT A CITY PUTTING THAT PROGRAM TOGETHER INCENTIVIZE IS A A POTENTIAL FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT TO TAKE ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY. ASSEMBLY BECAUSE THE CITY WOULD GET ARENA REDUCTION THAT'S NOT CLEAR TO AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FUNCTION THAT IS PRIMARILY CARRIED OUT BY THE COUNTIES. THAT WERE GIVING CREDIT TO THE SET TO A CITY TO DO. WE'RE ASKING A CD COGS IN KNOW. LITTLE ABOUT THE SUBJECT TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT SO ALL OF THOSE SEE MIKE IN THE END OF THE DAY WON'T REALLY ACHIEVE THE INTENDED. IMPACT BUT IT WILL POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN OUR PLANNING OBLIGATIONS AND FOR THOSE REASONS GIVEN OUR OUR INCREDIBLE HOUSING CRISIS WE WOULD JUST CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL AND HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ACHIEVE HIS GOALS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY OTHERS AN OPPOSITION SB. SIX NINETY FIVE SIGNAL TAKE ABOUT TWO OR SENATOR BILL OKAY -- I BELIEVE IF A CITY GIVES FUNDS TO A GROUP HOME FOR FOSTER USE. THAT WOULD QUALIFY TO MEET THE RANGE -- OBLIGATIONS IT SEEMS RATHER INCONGRUOUS THAT THE STATE. IS ADVOCATING REDUCING. THE AMOUNT OF FOSTER USE IN GROUP HOMES. AND ALLOWING THE READ A THE REASON HOUSING ALLOCATION TO BE COUNTED IF THEY GIVE MONEY TO A A GROUP HOME -- BUT NOT A FAMILY FOSTER CARE HOME. SO I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT ARE WE ADOPTED A LAW -- THANKS -- SOME WOMEN STONE HAD IT TO DO A REFORM OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE. KIDS -- TO RE GET OUT OF GROUP HOMES. OKAY THAT WAS THAT IS NOW SET THE STATE POLICY. WE WANT WE WANT TO FOSTER YOU HAVE TO GO INTO FAMILY HOMES OR TO LIVE IN A AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING ONCE THEY REACHED. ONCE THEY TURN EIGHTEEN SO THAT'S THE THAT'S A POLICY. SO IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY STRANGE THAT [inaudible] WE CAN [inaudible] SUPPORT [inaudible] VOUCHERS OR KIND OF A PROGRAM FOR SUPPORTING GROUP HOMES I KNOW THAT GROUP HOMES HAVE CLOSED. ALL OVER THE STATE IT'S A THE pBIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. THERE'S THERE'S GROUP HOMES CLOSING AND THE GROUP HOMES ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SO THEY NEED. THE TO HAVE THEY NEED TO RECRUIT MORE FAMILIES. AND I THINK THIS IS MAYBE  WAY A LOANS OF A MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE OR SOME OTHER KINDS OF SUPPORT SYSTEM. FOR FOR OUR FOSTER FAMILIES COULD BE DEVELOPED THAT WOULD -- BO A WIN WIN FOR THE FOSTER CARE BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE HOUSING. FOR FOSTER YOU NEED TO HAVE THE HOUSING SO. I WILL MAKE A MOTION FOR THE BILL ON THAT BASIS -- MAYBE THERE'S SOME ISSUES THAT CENTER PORTANTINO NEEDS TO WORK OUT. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO SUPPORT FAMILY FOSTER CARE -- A I WAS JUST TALKING TO MY ONE OF MY A FORMER STAFF MEMBERS. WHO WAS A FOSTER? WAS IN FOSTER CARE ABOUT THIS VERY SUBJECT. FRIDAY I HAD A MEETING FRIDAY JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY SUBJECT. HOW? THERE'S SIMILARLY A BUREAUCRATIC. TENNESSEE TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONAL GROUP HOMES BUT NOT FOSTER FAMILY HOMES. SO I'M GLAD YOU CAME UP WITH THIS BILL CENTER PORTANTINO. I THINK WE NEED TO FOLLOW E WE NEED WE NEED FOR ASSISTANCE THE WITH OUR STATE POLICY WE SUPPORT. FAMILY ORIENTED FOSTER CARE. SO I SUPPORT THE BILL I LIKE MOTION. CAN YOU CENTER BUILT IN THE FOR COMMENTS. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU IT SHOULD IT. I GUESS I AM STILL LOOKING VIEWS ABOUT HOW THE MECHANISM WOULD WORK SO YOU CAN EXPLAIN SO WHAT HAPPENS SO CITY WHICH HAS TO HAVE ARENA. HOW WOULD THEY CLAIM THE 5% CREDIT SO LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH THE OKAY I WAS HOPING THAT TO HAVE THE OPTION? SO RIGHT NOW WHEN THE CITY PRESENTED HOUSING ELEMENT IT HAS TO SHOW PLANNED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BUILD THE PHONE ABOUT. HAS TO SHOW THAT THAT THERE'S A PLAN RIGHT. AND SO THIS BILL WOULD ONLY. APPLY TO CITIES THAT HAVE A CURRENT HOUSING ELEMENT THAT TO ALREADY APPROVED SO IF YOU'RE A BAD CITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A HOUSING ELEMENT. YOU'VE TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT. THIS DOESN'T APPLY SO YOU NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE TO BE AT A CITY WITH THE APPROVED PLAN NUMBER. TWO DURING THE TIME BEFORE YOUR NEXT PLAN IS APPROVED. UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL PLAN WHICH IS HAS TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN PLAN FOR HOUSING. IF YOU ACTUALLY PLACE. FOSTER YOU. IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. UP 25% OF THAT CAN BE COUNTED FOR YOUR RENO OBLIGATION WHEN YOU GO TO RENEW YOUR NEXT POINT. NOT A THEORETICAL PLAN FOR PLACING KIDS BUT UP BUT THE THE IDEAS THAT THIS. A CHURCH A QANTAS CLUB A PROGRAM WITHIN A CITY WOULD COME UP AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S. INCENTIVIZE OUR CONGREGATE IN OUR OUR COMMUNITY TO PLACE KIDS IN THESE MONIES AYE BUT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. DETAIL SO [inaudible] FOR EVERY CHILD EVERY FOSTER CHILD WHOSE PLACE. IN THE IN A HOLLOW IN A HOME IN THE LIMITS OF THE CITY HE LANDED IN THEIR CITY. IN THAT PARTICULAR CITY WOULD CALENDAR THE JURISDICTION OF THAT HOUSING ELEMENT. UP 25% SO BUT SO EACH PLACED WOULD COUNT AS ONE HOUSE RIGHT SO IF YOU HAD A HUNDRED K. IF YOU HAD AN OBLIGATION OF EIGHT HUNDRED OKAY IF YOU PLACED FIVE CHILDREN IN FIVE HOMES SO LET ME JUST ASK ANOTHER QUESTION AND SO. CITIES COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES RIGHT SUMMER SMALL SOME ARE LARGER. I THINK ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES IS TO BE SURE WE PLACE A FOSTER YOUTH IN THE RIGHT HOME I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF FAMILIES ETCETERA. SO THEY GET SO AT A WALTERS EIGHT A CHILD IS PLACED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN ONE CITY. GETS PLACE WITH A RELATIVE ARE IN ANOTHER CITY. WHICH CITY GETS THE CREDIT. THE CITY THAT'S ABILITY. OF CURRENT EXISTENCE SO. HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE STILL TO RIGHT ALL WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE HELPING AUGMENT THE COUNTIES EFFORTS TO FIND NEW HOMES? BY INCENTIVIZING A CITY COUNCIL VOLUNTARY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO CLEAR HOME THIS IS A GLORIFIED SITUATION EXPLAIN IT'S THE CITY. IN WHICH THE THAT CREATES A PROBLEM THAT THAT THAT PLATE AND WHICH IS PLACE SO THIS THAT THEY HAVE A YOUTH. NOW THEY WERE WITH ONE FAMILY MEMBER DAY GOT PLACED IN FOSTER CARE BECAUSE OF WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES. RIGHT AND THEN TURNS OUT YEAH COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER I THE THE SOCIAL WORKER AND A STEP BY THE BEST POSSIBLE PLACEMENT IS IN ANOTHER CITY. THE SUNNIS IN CALIFORNIA THAN -- THAN THAT CITY THAT THAT FAST YOU THIS PLACE THEN IS THE ONE WHO QUOTE GETS THE CREDIT RIGHT AGAINST THEIR ARENA BY BECAUSE THEY'RE CREATING A NEW HOME. OKAY THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A NEW FOSTER. HOME. AND INCENTIVIZE PLACING CHILDREN IN THESE HOMES OKAY SO THIS IS A CITY IT'S SELF NEED TO DO I MEAN IDEALLY I THINK YOU TRY COURAGE CITIES. THE REST IS FIVE ALA TERRY BUT BUT I MEAN IT COULD BE THAT JUST PASSIVELY THIS. THE SERBS THEIR NUMBER WILL HAPPEN RIGHT JUST BECAUSE THE COUNTIES WORKING TO PLACE THESE FOSTER YOUTH YEAH THERE WILL BE SOME PLACE WHERE BUT AS AL SAID WERE RUNNING SHORT. OF OPPORTUNITIES NOW I KNOW AND IN PARTICULAR SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES DON'T. HAVE VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF FOSS AND THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS TRYING TO CREATE. SORT OF NONTRADITIONAL. PLACEMENTS IN IN HOMES THAT WOULD NORMALLY DO THIS BY CREATING A LOCAL VOLUNTARY AFTER THAT THE WHOLE THEORY BEHIND OKAY ALL RIGHT AND I DON'T WANT TO REWARD A PLAN. I WANT TO REWARD ACTION RIGHT RIGHT PLACEMENT OKAY AND AND OUR HOUSING CHAIR SITS ON THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND WENT THROUGH HOUSING AND HOUSING HIS PERSPECTIVE ON HOW BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS. THE HOW THE IMPACTS ARE FOR WILL HOUSING PLANS BUT DAY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT DID PASS THROUGH THE COMMITTEE ALREADY SO IF I GET RID AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR FOR SENATOR WIENER BUT WE DID TAKE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT OKAY. OKAY SUGGEST ADDING ONE MOST PROMINENT ONE BEING IN ORDER TO QUALIFY YOU HAVE TO BE A CITY WITH AN APPROVED HOUSING HEALTH. OKAY EVEN START OKAY AS I I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD A GOOD AMENDMENT OKAY I JUST WANT TO CLEAR OKAY THIS THANK YOU HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW YOU BILLS BEFORE THANK YOU. CENTERS HAVE ONE QUESTION HOW WERE -- COUNTY IS GOING TO BE COMMUNICATING WITH CITIES THAT THEY PLACE X. AMOUNT OF KIDS INTO HOMES SO THAT THEY CAN RELATE OR CREDIT THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS I MEAN COUNTIES THAT PLACE KIDS IN. HOMES NOW HAVE A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HOST AND THE COUNTY THERE NOTHING'S CHANGING THAT BUT SOMEONE UP BEHIND IT BUT AS A CITY BECAUSE SERENA CREDIT RIGHT THE CITY WILL GET ON IT CREDIT HOW ARE THEY GOING TO KNOW. THAT THE COUNTY IS PLACED A CHILD IN THEIR JURISDICTION SO THEY CAN CLAIM BUT PART OF THIS IS EDUCATING THE CITY'S RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT'S THIS TOOL IS AVAILABLE IF THE BILL GETS SIGNED. YOU KNOW WILL WORK THROUGH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES WILL MAKE SURE THAT CITIES ARE. ARE MADE AWARE OF THIS NEW. YOU KNOW. HOUSING TOOL I MEAN THAT'S MY WHOLE SO MAYBE SHOULD TAKE A MOMENT SO THIS BILL -- I WANT TO SUPPORT IT TODAY THE THIRD SOME TYPE OF A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND THE RECOGNIZE BENEFICIARY CITY BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO GET THAT CREDIT ABSOLUTELY AND WE WANT TO CITIES TO KNOW ABOUT THIS SO THEY CAN. YOU KNOW AND WHEN WE ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MR WIENER. SUGGEST WAS GOING FROM 10% 25% I WAS FINE WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO SEE IF. THE INCENTIVE WORKS YOU KNOW AND SEE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY GET KIDS AT HOME IT'S A VERY AND IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW MANY IT'S ABOUT WHETHER THIS WORKS -- SO THANKS YOUR CREATIVITY -- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR BELL WHICH I CAN EXACTLY YES RIVAL SO WITH HIS -- DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. RICARDO STONE BY STONE AYE BELL. BELL I'D JACKSON PAN. HI PAN AYE WIENER. THREE ZERO THREE ZERO THAT'LL STAY ON CALL SENATOR CONGRATULATIONS WIENER GLAZER. SENATOR GLAZER SB. THREE SEVENTY FOUR I'LL POINT OUT THIS -- DOES HAVE SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES. WELCOME. THANK YOU A THIS DEVICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. A LOT OF FIRST BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. THEY MAKE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS AND RAISE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM ON IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. BUT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS PARENTS ON CAL WORKS TO CONTINUE RECEIVING FULL BENEFITS THROUGH THE PROGRAM AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN IN GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING. BILL ALSO REQUIRES COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE THE STUDENT PARENTS WITH FUNDS TO PURCHASE BOOKS. PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THEIR ACADEMIC TERM. COLLEGE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF HOUSING AND FOOD IN SECURITY. MAKING A COLLEGE EDUCATION LESS ACCESSIBLE ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FOR STUDENTS PARENTS STUDENT PARENTS ON CAL WORKS. STUDENT PARENTS ON CAL WORKS ARE OFTEN REQUIRED TO WORK AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TO THIRTY HOURS. TO RECEIVE FULL POWER BENEFITS. NOT ONLY IS IT DIFFICULT TO BE A PARENT. FULL TIME COLLEGE STUDENT AND WORK TWENTY TO THIRTY HOURS ALL THE SAME TIME. BUT OF A STUDENT PARENT ON CAL WORKS IS NOT MEET THE WORK REQUIREMENTS. THEY DO NOT NEED IT. THEY CAN HAVE THEIR BENEFITS REDUCED. THIS EFFECTIVELY PUNISHES LOW INCOME PARENTS FOR SEEKING A COLLEGE EDUCATION THINK ABOUT THAT. THE POLICY THAT'S IN PLACE TODAY. DISCRIMINATES AGAINST THE PARENT. FULL TIME COLLEGE STUDENT. TRYING TO GET AN EDUCATION. THE ONLY FORTY EIGHT MONTHS OF ELIGIBILITY ON CAL WORKS AVAILABLE IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE ENSURE THAT STUDENTS PARENTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION. FOR THEIR ELIGIBILITY AND CAL WORK WORKS ENDS. FURTHERMORE MANY CAL WORK STUDENT PARENTS FACE BARRIERS TO PURCHASING THE REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS FOR THEIR CLASSES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR BOOK FUNDS FROM THE COUNTY AND TIME. IN THIS SCENARIO STUDENTS MAKE THE DECISION TO PUT OFF BUYING THEIR BOOKS THINK ABOUT THAT. THEY PUT OFF BUYING THEIR BOOKS UNTIL THEY CAN RECEIVE THE MONEY WHICH PUTS THEM BEHIND -- IN THEIR COURSE WORK. OR THEY BUY THEIR BOOKS WITH THEIR OWN FUNDS RUN CREDIT FINANCIALLY STRAINING THEMSELVES EVEN FURTHER. THIS BILL PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS THAT WANT TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT BY GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION WELL STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR IN WHICH THEY RECEIVE FUNDS TO PURCHASE THEIR TEXTBOOKS. THREE SEVENTY FOUR HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SUPPORTED BY GREAT COALITION STUDENT GROUPS SOME OF WHOM ARE HERE. TRAVELED A LONG WAYS WHICH I APPRECIATE.

AND I'M ON WELFARE. I RELY ON CAL FOR US TO BUY ENOUGH NUTRITIOUS FOOD TO FEED MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN AND THEY RECEIVE HEALTH COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICARE BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD THE DEPENDENT COVERAGE THROUGH MY UNIVERSITY. I WOULD HAVE RELIED ON CAL WORKS AS WELL WERE IT NOT FOR THE EXTREMELY ARDUOUS OUTDATED AND BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS AND BARRIERS THAT THIS PROGRAM IMPOSES UPON STUDENT PARENTS WHO RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT. AS IT STANDS IF I WERE CAO WORKS RECIPIENT I WOULD NEED TO PHYSICALLY REPORT TO THE COUNTY ON A WELFARE DEPARTMENT EVERY TIME MY CLASS SCHEDULE CHANGES. EVERY TIME A TAKE OR T. A. A DIFFERENT CLASS AND EVERY TIME THERE'S A SINGLE CHANGE IN ANYTHING REGARDING MY ACADEMIC RECORDS. YOU CAN HARDLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH OF A BURDEN THAT PTS ON ME AND MY PEERS WHO BETWEEN SUPPORTING OUR FAMILIES AND PURSUING OR EDUCATION. DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO NAVIGATE THESE KINDS OF BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS. THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT SB. THREE SEVEN FOUR THIS BILL ENSURES THAT STUDENT PARENTS LIKE MYSELF CAN RECEIVE THE MUCH NEEDED BENEFITS OF CAL WORKS AND BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION AS THE PATHWAY OF UPWARD MOBILITY.

SO YES I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY OF THEIRS IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE SEVENTY FOUR PLEASE COME FORWARD. IF NOT IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION SB. THREE SEVENTY FOUR XENON COMING BACK TO MY FELLOW SENATORS CENTER PAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I APPRECIATE THAT THE THIS -- YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I GUESS I WENT QUESTIONS AN ANALYSIS. IT THAT DOES MAKE MENTION THERE'S A CURRENT THERE'S A CURRENT MECHANISM -- IN WHICH DHEA FUNNY FOR FOOT TALL AND SLICE EXPENSES THAT INCLUDES BOOKS AND TRANSPORTATION WHICH CAN BE ADVANCED -- FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. COMPLETING THEIR WELFARE TO WORK ACTIVITIES SO HOW HOW DOES THIS -- BILL INTERFACE WITH WITH WITH THAT MECHANISM I MEAN THAT OF JUST WHAT TRAFFIC OUT SO WE DON'T HAVE MULTIPLE MECHANISMS WHICH CREATE CAN CREATE EVEN MORE CONFUION AS TO ITS GREAT WE CAN. TRY TO SUPPORT MORE PEOPLE BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU DO NOT HAVE MULTIPLE MECHANISMS THAT COULD CREATE CONFUSION AS TO HOW TO GET SUPPORT SELL PRICES OF THE FIGHT NIGHT INCREASED COMPLEXITY. THE KEVIN OTHER QUARTERS CALIFORNIA FOR RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS CURRENTLY WHAT HAPPENS WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STUDENTS. WHO START GOING TO COLLEGE AND THEY CAN'T GET THE BOOKS PAID THE SUBMIT ALL OF THE VERIFICATION THROUGH WELFARE SYSTEM? BUT IT GETS HUNG UP IN THE PLAKA SEE AN UP TO TWO WEEKS TO HAVE TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL I'VE SEEN WOMAN ACTUALLY DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AND NEVER TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AGAIN. AND AND JUST TO THE LEFT TO INVESTMENT SHATTERED WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO WOULD FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER WOULD GIVE UNDER THE VANCE CHECK OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BUY BOOKS. AFTER THAT HE WILL PROVIDE VERIFICATION AND WE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO AMEND THE BILL. THAT THE STORY WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE VERIFICATION OF HOW THEY SPEND THE MONEY. AND THE FOR COST MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THEN THE ACCOUNT THEN THE COUNTY WOULD REIMBURSE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SHOW HOW THEY SPEND THE MONEY IS THAT THE SPONSOR. OKAY WELL OUT OF THE ME TRY TO ENHANCE A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE. THIS PROVIDES ANOTHER OPTION SENATOR THAT YES THERE THERE IS A SUPPORT -- SERVICES FOR ANCILLARY EXPENSES THIS TRIES TO CREATE A PROTOCOL FOR HOW THEY CAN GET PAYMENT EARLY. WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR RECEIPTS -- DEPEND TO BUY BOOKS BUT THAT IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO CREATE THAT COMPLEXITY SOME VERY COMMITTED TO IF THAT IF THAT THIS OVERLAY CREATES THAT CONFUSION IS NOT SOMETHING ANY OF THIS WASHER AND ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT ISN'T THE CASE. OKAY AND AND AND AND AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT YOUR ATTENTION SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE SITS IN THE LARGER SCHEME SO. FOR EXAMPLE -- A AND I THINK EITHER OF US RISING BECAUSE AT THE OF THE PRESENTED BEFORE BUDGETS OF THREE EVERY TIME OF OVERSEEING THIS I'M THINKING OKAY. NOW THIS VERY SAME SOCIAL WORKER WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE MOVING THE MONEY UP FRONT ON THE ANSWER SERVICES IS THE SAME ONE WHO IS GOING TO BE SIGNING OFF FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE. AND SO IN SOME SENSESI THINK PART OF IT IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT -- AT AND I WANT THIS BUILDING BEFORE BUT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE MOST EFFECTIVELY GET THE FUNDS TO THE STUDENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. YOU FROM OUT FUNDS IT ALSO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT I GUESS MICHAEL OVERHEAD -- THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN IN TERMS OF APPROVALS CLIMB BACK MONEY AND SO FORTH SO -- AT IT AND SO I DO SO -- HOPE THAT YOU CAN TRY TO WORK ON LOOK AT THESE MECHANISMS HOW TO BRING TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE IT IS GOING TO BE A DAD MAYBE MORE ABOUT SAYING THAT. YELLED HERE SOME GUIDELINES ON LIKE ON THE IT'S A SERVICES YOU NEED TO ADVANCE THE MONEY BY CERTAIN DEADLINE OR SOMETHING. AND THEN TRY TO INSTEAD OF GOING TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW SO JUST BE SURE WE TAKE THESE TWO PROCESSES AND FIND A WAY THIS. BRING THEM TOGETHER IN A WAY LIKE ED AND MAKE THEM AND AND AND SO THAT BECAUSE THIS PROCESS DOESN'T WORK DOESN'T AS A MEAN WE ALWAYS CREATE A BRAND NEW ONE BUT WHAT WE DO IS. BUT THE NEW RULES ON THE OLD ONE TO MAKE THAT WORK USING THINGS THAT WE KNOW SO FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE THEY NEED TO ADVANCE MONEY. AND THEN RECLAIM THIS IS THE MECHANISM USING NOW IN THAT PROCESS VERSUS SAYING WE HAVE THIS PROCESS HERE WE HAVE THAT PROCESS THERE AND SO ANYWAY I I WILL URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. THANK YOU THE AUTHORS COMMITTED TO DOING SO ABSOLUTELY SENATOR BILL MOOS THE BILL -- CENTERED RESERVE ELECT MAKE ANY FINAL COMMENTS THANK YOU FOR HEARING ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAT AFFECTS SO MANY MORE THAN YOU THINK.

THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT PREPARED ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES IN RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. THAT A CRAM A CRIMINAL JANICK ROACH. TO DEALING WITH USED TYPICALLY DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT DRIVE A YOUNG PERSON TO OFFEND. SP FOUR THIRTY THREE WILL ALLOW INTERESTED PILOT COUNTIES TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS YOUTH JUSTICE ISSUES THROUGH TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY RELEVANT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THAT ARE AGE APPROPRIATE AND IT EMPHASIS EMPHASISE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. THE PILOT OFFICES OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT DIVERSION WILL ACT AS A CENTRAL POINT OF COORDINATION FOR COMMUNITY BASED% ORGANIZATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COUNTY AGENCIES AND WILL WORK TO BLAND EXISTING COUNTY HEALTH SERVICES. AND COMMUNITY BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS TO BETTER ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ON JUSTICE INVOLVED TO USE. RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL EXPLICITLY REQUIRE THE COLLABORATION INCLUSION OF COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS IN THE WORK DONE BY THESE PILOT OFFICES. AND WILL IN NO WAY PREVENT PROBATION FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR EXISTING PROGRAMS. MOST OFTEN WITH USE WHO ARE ALREADY CHARGED IN IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. MEMBERS THIS MEASURE IS A VOLUNTARY IN TIME LIMITED PILOT PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW A HANDFUL OF COUNTIES TO EXPLORE NEW PATHWAYS IN ADDRESSING YOUTH JUSTICE ISSUES. THROUGH A PUBLIC HEALTH PLANS. I ASK THAT YOU JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING OUR JUSTICE INVOLVES YOUTH WITH COUNSELING IN SERVICES INSTEAD OF HAND CUFFS IN JAIL CELLS. WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MISTER CHAIR OF A COUPLE OF WITNESSES HERE TO TEST BUT I WITH PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ON I THINK WE'LL START WITH -- TAYLOR SCHOOLING IN PH WAS SANDERS COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR -- HELLO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I AM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE -- AND FOR LETTING ME SHARE WITH YOU -- SOME OF WHAT WE LEARNED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHY WHEN THINKING ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES EQUITABLY AND EFFECTIVELY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN ANY GIVEN JURISDICTION -- A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO TRUE JUSTICE SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION IS KEY AND AND AND IMPORTANCE. I AM I AM A PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHER AN EVALUATOR BY TRAINING AND I WILL HELP TO LEAVE OUT OF REAL COLLABORATIVE CROSS SECTOR -- GOVERNMENT COMMUNITY AT LAW ENFORCEMENT COURT A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. PROCESS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT RESULTED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OUR OFFICE OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSION -- LAST YEAR. THAT YEAR OF PLANNING THAT WE UNDERTOOK REALLY TOLD US -- THAT THE MISSING PIECE IN A IN A COLLECTION -- EFFORTS TO REFORM OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TRANSFORM OUR APPROACH TO YOUTH JUSTICE -- WAS IN PART A CENTRALIZED WHOLE FOCUS COORDINATION -- OF A REAL HEALING INFORMED COMMERCE SPONSORS AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT CENTERED APPROACH TO KEEPING YOUNG PEOPLE OUT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE POINT OF CONTACT. THE WE LEARNED I AM IN CONVERSATIONS WITH. YOUNG PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE PROVIDERS TO SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WHAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT WAS THIS VERY EARLY OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE FIELD -- TO REFER YOUNG PEOPLE TO COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS WHO WERE SUPPORTED IN TAKING A HEALTH AND HEALING APPROACH TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE THEY SERVED. I AM THE BENEFITS OF OF HOUSING THIS IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THIS TYPE OF COORDINATION. AS WE LEARNED IN LA -- WITH OUR COLLABORATIVE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS. INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING ONE AND THAT THIS ALLOWED THE PRIORITIZATION OF SUSTAINABLE COUNTY RESOURCES FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THAT ARE TRULY CAPABLE OF IMPROVING. THE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE. TO THEM THAT A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO THIS TYPE OF EARLY DIVERSION -- CONNECTS OTHERWISE SILO DEFECTORS WITH COMMUNITY AND BOTH SORT OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THE WORK -- THAT IT IN A WAY THAT BUILDS BY AN AND AVOIDS ANY UNANTICIPATED HARMS OF SORT OF MISSION DRIFTING -- IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM MORE BRINGING PEOPLE UNDER THAT THE BURDEN FROM SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STREAMLINE. AND AVOID WHENEVER POSSIBLE -- AND THEN THIRD I AM THAT THIS TYPE OF COORDINATION WOULD ALLOW FOR THE SUPPORT OF ONGOING RESEARCH AND EVALUATION. THAT WOULD KEEP ALL SYSTEMS ACCOUNTABLE TO LONG TERM IMPROVEMENT AND THE SORT OF PLUGGING INTO HEALTH RESEARCH WHAT ALLOWS US ALL TO LOOK AT A WIDE RANGE OF YOUTH OUTCOMES NOT JUST RECIDIVISM. BUT ALSO HEALTH ACADEMIC -- AND OTHER OUTCOMES AT THAT TRULY TELL US HOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DOING. I'M FINALLY I'LL JUST SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW OUR EXPERIENCE THAT WAY I THINK IT'S REALLY HIGHLIGHTED BY -- RECENT LITERATURE RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR ANY HE FEE FOUNDATIONS TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT TITLED TRANSFORMING JUVENILE PROBATION FOR EXAMPLE -- FURTHER SUPPORTS WHAT WE LEARNED IN LA THEY STATED THAT DIVERSION QUOTE SHOULD BE HANDLED BY ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND OR PUBLIC HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY OUTSIDE THE COURT SYSTEM -- THIS COMMITMENT TO TAKING A A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO THIS TRANSFORMATION -- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS BEEN A REAL JOY TO WATCH AND EXPERIENCE ITS LEAD TO UNPRECEDENTED COLLABORATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ADVOCATES AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND AND HAS GIVEN US A REAL INFORMED FOUNDATION FROM WHICH TO MAKE A REAL COMMUNITY DRIVEN CHANGE AND I AM THRILLED AT THE IDEA THAT THAT MORE JURISDICTIONS WOULD -- EMBARK ON THE JOURNEY.

AND NOT ONE BY THE OPPOSITION AS BEFORE THIRTY THREE PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] HERE'S THEY CLOSE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ WITH THE CHEAP PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TODAY IN AND RESPECTFUL -- OPPOSITION I DO WANT TO JUST THINK A CENTER MONNING AND IS STAFF FOR ONGOING DIALOGUE -- OLDER FOR MY TIME OVER TO YOU -- CHIEF JIM SALLY ILL -- FOR TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON -- JIM SALLY -- CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY AND IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT. OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BUT I FIRST WANT TO THANK US UNDERMINE FOR BEING A PARTNER. OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS AND OVER THE YEARS AND AND TWO BOXES OF VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CENTER HAS OFFICE ON THIS BILL. BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS BEFORE THIRTY THREE REPRESENTS AN APPROACH WE ARE IN OPPOSITION. TO WE SHARED WITH THE SENATOR OUR AGREEMENT WITH HIM THAT PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY FACTORS THAT PLAY SOME CHILDREN RISK A VERY IMPORTANT IN PD AND NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. FACTORS SUCH AS PROBERT POVERTY TRAUMA ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES HUNGER ARE. IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND IF ADDRESSED EARLY THEY CAN LIVE A CONTACT WITH OUR DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE AREA WHERE WE DISAGREE ON THE APPROACH ARE THE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT COMBINED EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. AND THE VERSION UNDER NEW COUNTY ENERGY PROVIDED FOR UP PROVIDING THESE DIVERSION SERVICES OVER THE YEARS PROBATION HAS INVESTED IN DIVERSION AND BUILD LINKAGES AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH DECADES. OF THROUGH THE DECADES WITH OTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENTS. AND OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DATA SHOW A PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN YOUTH JUVENILE JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. AND WE ALL HAVE LOCAL COMMUNITY -- AT JUVENILE JUSTICE PLANS THAT DO SPELL OUT HOW DIVERSION SHOULD BE HANDLED AND HOW -- CLOBBERED SHOULD BE HELD IN THE COUNTIES. OUR OUR PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED TO DETERMINE TO BE EVIDENCE BASED. THE TO AND SET OF SERVICES A NEW AND SHE WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD WITH FROM PROGRAMS -- OUTCOMES THAT WE KNOW ALREADY WORK. SET UP A NEW COUNTY AND IS HE TO FOCUS ON DIVERSION WOULD BE SIMILAR. TO IN THE NATURE TO HAVING TO STATE AGENCIES WITH THE SAME MISSION RESPONSIBILITIES. INSTEAD THE BILL SHOULD FOCUS EFFORTS NOT UNDER VERSION BUT ON THE SYSTEM THAT NEED SUPPORT TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF YOUTH -- WERE DIVERSION BECOMES NECESSARY. AGAIN WE WE BELIEVE THE COMBINING DIVERSION. WITH OTHER YOUTH DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS UNDER NEWLY CREATED COUNTY AND TO YOU WOULD BE TWO PARALLEL TRACKS. FOR DIVERSION SERVICES WHICH WOULD TURN INTO -- COMPLICATED -- COMPLICATED SERVICES TO YOUTH AND COMPLEXITY THE PROGRAM SERVICE DELIVERY. INSTEAD OF A BILL THAT FOCUS ON THE FRONT END USED DEVELOPMENT. AND STILL MET THE INTO THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR WHICH IS TO ADDRESS ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST COURSE FOR THIS REASON WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. IS THERE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION -- PLEASE COME FORWARD -- SING AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION THIS IS A THE VOLUNTARY -- PILOT PROGRAM -- YOU HAVE A MONOPOLY ON HELPING THESE USE LIKE WE HAVE THE YOUNG MAN THAT WISH THAT WE HAD A SERVICE LIKE THIS A CUT OF REBOUNDED HIM FROM HAVING FURTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. NO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOUGH THAT OUR DIVERSIONS SERVICES THAT WE ARE SUPPLYING THE COUNTY ART THERE AND CONTINUE TO PROSPER -- HAVING COMPETING SERVICES WITH THE COUNTY JUST TO ME IS. COMPLICITOUS AND NOT NEEDED IN IN AN ACCOUNT THAT HAS PROVIDE I MEAN WE WORK WITH SOCIAL SERVICES WITH MENTAL HEALTH WITH OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE DO A DIVERSION -- TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT ENTITY WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE A GOVERNMENT AND SEEING PROBATION. UNDERTAKING DIVERSION IS NOT NEEDED. OKAY THANK YOU FOR ANSWERS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OF CENTERS [inaudible] SENATOR PAN. THE CEREMONY I'D APPRECIATE YEAH YEAH YEAH -- YOU I TAKE A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH -- ON THIS ISSUE AND AND I THINK YOU'LL CERTAINLY WE SHARE YOUR GOAL OF TRYING. TO KEEP YOU FROM HAVING. TO ESSENTIALLY ENTERED THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT BEEN DESCRIBED -- THE WITH A SAID DESCRIBED IS WHAT. WHERE DO YOU SEE AND THIS AGAIN THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE OFFER FOR COUNTIES ARE INTERESTED IN? SO WHAT DO YOU SEE THE ROLE FOR PROBATION I I'LL TELL YOU THAT CERTAINLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY I THINK -- WE'VE A VERY INNOVATIVE PROBATION -- CHIEF AND THE DEPARTMENT THAT ACTUALLY MY OFFICE IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY ON THE TRY TO ADDRESS. THESE VERY ISSUES SO I GUESS I'M TRAIL. AND YET SINCE I WAS A READER BILLS LIKE WILD MEAN SACRAMENTO REALLY TRY COULD PARTICIPATE IF PROBATION WAS INVOLVED SO CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAKER OUT WHAT HOW. DOES GIVEN THE I KNOW WE WHAT TAKE A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH OF LEGALLY IN PUBLIC HEALTH I KNOW YOU ARE TOO HOW HOW LONG WHAT WE DO WITH THE I MEAN. FOR SOLAR AFTER REPLACE THE EXISTING PROBATION PART OF BUT I GUESS WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE. PROBATION DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE INNOVATIVE THAT ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCE DOING THAT SITTING IN WITH YOUR ID WITH YOUR I GUESS YOUR PROPOSAL WHEN I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND THROUGH THE CHAIR -- RESPONDING BUT YOUR QUESTION I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERNS. RAISED BY A CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS SALLY -- WHO WE HAVE HAD A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY? I THINK WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT THIS THROUGH SOME DIFFERENT LENSES IN MY VIEW VOLUNTARY PILOT PROGRAM YOU GET MORE RESOURCES INTO A COUNTY. TO TO CREATE GREATER COLLABORATION REMEMBER THIS IS DESIGNED. MERELY TO IDENTIFY AND WORK WITH USE BEFORE THEIR INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM PROBATION HAS BEEN DOING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THEY DO WORK WITH DIVERSION PROGRAMS. OUR BILL DOESN'T STOP. ESTABLISH PROBATION PROGRAMS IN ANY FASHION WE WOULD THINK THESE PILOTS WOULD BE LABORATORIES FOR GREATER COLLABORATION BUT BRINGING IN. IN A MORE DIRECTED MANNER -- PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IN BEING PART OF THAT GREATER INTENTIONAL COLLABORATION. PRE ARREST -- WORKING WITH SCHOOLS IDENTIFYING AT RISK YOUTH. THE BEAUTY OF THE LA PROGRAM EVEN NOW IT'S IN ITS INFANCY IS HAVING TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AS WE HEARD FROM THE WITNESSES WE THINK THAT PROVIDES A MODEL THAT THOSE WHO VOLUNTARILY WOULD ELECT. TO TRY A PILOT PROGRAM IN THEIR COUNTY ARE NECESSARILY GOING. TO CORDONING COLLABORATE WITH PROBATION DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO THE THE IMPORTANCE OF ESTABLISHING. IT OUT SIDE OF THE UMBRELLA PROBATION IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PUTTING IT OUTSIDE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN'T CORDONING COLLABORATE WITH PROBATION. AND IF IT IS THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MIGHT ALSO JUST ASK OUR EXPERT FROM NEW YORK LAWCENTER IF SHE MIGHT WANT TO ADD TO THAT RESPONSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU AB. SO YEAH I WOULD IT IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION CENTER I THINK THAT -- THEY'RE DEFINITELY I THINK I WOULD JUST ECHO WHAT THE CENTER SAID THERE IS A PLACE FOR PROBATION TO CONTINUE DOING THE WORK THE GOOD WORK THE PROBATION IS ALREADY DOING. THIS IS TARGETING YOUTH PRE ARREST THERE IS NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THE FURTHER A CHILD OR YOUTH GOES THROUGH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM STARTING AT A REST. THE FURTHER THE HARMS THAT HAPPENED AND SO THIS BILL REALLY IS TRYING TO TARGET WHAT BASICALLY THE QUESTION IS WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO GET ON PROBATION TO GET SERVE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. THAT THEY SHOULDN'T THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY IF THEY HAPPEN TO GET ARRESTED AND GET ON PROBATION AND CAN GET THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THROUGH PROBATION. THAT'S GREAT BUT BEFORE THAT. THE KIDS THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO SERVICES IMPORTS IF YOU LOOK AT WHILE THE COMMUNITIES THERE ARE WAY MORE SERVICES SUPPORTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR TO YOUTH. THAT ARE NOT SIMILARLY SITUATED IN POOR COMMUNITIES WHAT LA COUNTY HAS DONE. THEY DID A LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS TO SEE WHERE ARE THE SERVICES IN THE PORTS AND WHERE DO THEY NEED TO BE AND THIS OFFICE OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT DIVERSION WOULD BE COORDINATING THOSE SERVICES SUPPORTS. SPECIFICALLY THROUGH A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH -- WITHOUT HAVING THE HARMS OF SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT SO THAT'S REALLY THE CRUX OF IT I AM IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY IS IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR -- JUST A QUICK QUESTION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. SO WHY WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO IT. THE PROBATION BARBARA PROBATION STONE A GREAT JOB AND EVERYTHING. WHAT WHY WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO THIS? OTHER POSSIBILITY -- OR YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT AT ALL. IF YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO AGREE TO DO THIS PROGRAM THAT'S WHAT HAS ME PUZZLED. AND I KNOW THERE'S OPPOSITION TO A BUT I DON'T I DON'T GET IT SOME OF YEAH I I I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I THINK -- PART OF THE CONCERN REALLY IN MY APOLOGIES. FOR SINGLE -- I THINK PART OF THE CONCERN IS ABOUT -- OBVIOUSLY I WE SHARE THE FOCUS TO BREAK DOWN SILOS IN THIS REGARD AND TO BUILD THE COLLABORATIONS -- MANY OF WHICH PROBATION IS DONE WITH WITH OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SO I THINK THERE'S A A VERY -- REAL OPERATIONAL CONCERN THAT BY. RATHER THAN USING THE EXISTING KIND OF COUNTY INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD THOSE LINKAGES LOCALLY AMONG ALL THE COUNTY DEPARTMENTS IS SETTING UP. A KIND OF NEW OFFICE -- THAT WOULD HAVE THAT WOULD HAVE SHARE SOME OF THE MISSION WITH PROBATION BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. OFTEN IS OVERLOOKED IS THE EXTENSIVE WORK THAT PROBATION DOES NOT JUST ON THE YOUTH ONCE THEY COME TO US AND DIVERTING THEM OUT OF OUR HOLES THE REALLY TO DO A LOT OF THAT EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION WORKS -- TO TO PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES SUPPORTS BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY -- COMING TO US ON A PETITION AND SO AGAIN I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT WE DO YOU SET UP AGAIN SIMILAR TO KIND OF HAVING TO STATE AGENCIES -- HAVING A SHARED MISSION THAT. WITH THE INTENT TO BREAK DOWN SILOS THAT ACTUALLY CREATE MORE ISSUES OF SERVING YOUTH IN WHAT CAPACITY AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE IN USE THAT ARE. NOT BEING SERVED AS A RESULT OF THOSE CONCURRENT PROCESS BUT IF YOU HAVE THESE CONCERNS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. IS THAT RIGHT IT THE CHOICE WOULD BE UP TO A COUNTY -- SO IS PRESUMABLY THE COUNTIES GOING TO COORDINATE. WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH PROBATION WITH OTHERS TO DETERMINE WE WANT TO TRY THIS AGAIN. MY RESPONSE WOULD BE. IF THE COUNTY WANTS TO TRY THE PILOT CAN DRAW MORE RESOURCES TO ASSIST THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF RESOURCES. IF IF PROBATION THINKS THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING RAISED -- I WOULD. ASKED TO SEE. HOW THEY'RE BEING DIRECTED TO PRE ARREST YOUTH IN THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED AGAIN VOLUNTARY PILOT? WHAT PRACTICES DO WE LEARN WE WOULD HOPE PROBATION IN THE COUNTIES THAT WANT TO OPT IN? IN BE GIVEN A CHANCE WOULD EMBRACE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU THE CENTER. AS OUR MOTION. BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR JACKSON WHICH ARE TO CLOSE IN THE MONEY I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION I WOULD URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE SOME PROBATION I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINED -- TO COLLABORATION AND WORK ON THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS A DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS A CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. RICARDO STONE BY STONE I FELL. BILL I JACKSON. JACKSON I CAN WHY PAN AYE WIENER. FOUR ZERO FOUR ZERO ORDERLY THE ROLE OF IN THE CENTER MONEY. US SENATOR WINNERS -- STILL TIED UP IN ANOTHER HEARING SO WITH -- THE COMMITTEE'S CONCURRENCE I'D LIKE TO PRESENT MY SP. FOUR ONE TWO AND SENATOR BILL. AND YOU WANT TO SHARE. SIR SORRY OF THE FOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HONORABLE. MEMBERS. I'M VERY HAPPY TO PRESENT SB FOUR ONE TWO THE LAND FROM AN ACT THIS CALIFORNIA'S PROMISE TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. VERY WELL OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ARE PART OF THE SERVICE SYSTEM. REGIONAL CENTERS ARE THEIR HEART CORDONING SERVICES IN A CONNECTING FAMILIES TO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION THE SUFFERED MANY SUFFERED MANY CUTS AS WELL AS FEES IMPOSED ON FAMILIES. THESE THESE REALLY SHOULD BE CALLED DISABILITY TAXES BECAUSE THEY ARE A BARRIER BETWEEN CHILDREN AND THE SERVICES THEY NEED INCLUDING SERVICES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. THEY ALSO HURT WHAT IS MEANT TO BE A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CENTERS AND THOSE THAT THEY SERVE. SB FOUR ONE TWO REPEAL TWO OF THESE FEES THE FAMILY COST PARTICIPATION PROGRAM AND THE ANNUAL FAMILY PROGRAM FEE. BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS REYES LITTLE MONEY AND FORCE RESOURCE CENTER TO SPEND TIME AND RESOURCES. FOCUSED ON COLLECTING MONEY INSTEAD OF COORDINATING AND DELIVERING SERVICES BY REPEALING THEM WE COULD REMOVE THESE BARRIERS TO SERVICE FOR CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THEIR FAMILIES. TODAY WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR ONE TWO IS AMY WESTLING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ARCA. AND JENNIFER BLOOM WHO WORKS FOR ALL THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER. WELCOME LADIES OF MY WHEN THIS IS A TWO WAY RACE IS PLEASE. YES MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES AND I WANT TO FIRST THANK SENATOR STONE FOR YOUR ON GOING SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. AS WELL AS EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL. AS SENATOR STONE NOTED THE FAMILY BECAUSE PARTICIPATION PROGRAM REQUIRES REGIONAL CENTERS TO ASSESS CHILDREN'S NEEDS FOR FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES. INCLUDING RESPITE IN DAY CARE AND THEN TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES THEY FUND FOR SOME CHILDREN IN RESPONSE TO FAMILY INCOME. THE ANNUAL FAMILY PROGRAM FOR YOU. REQUIRES MANY PARENTS OF INFANTS TODDLERS AND CHILDREN SIR BY REGIONAL CENTERS TO PAY A FEE TO THE STATE BECAUSE THEY ACCESS. NEEDED SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IN RESPONSE PROGRAM'S REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE SEEN FAMILIES DECLINING OR POSTPONING SERVICE. FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN. POSTPONING SERVICES THEIR CHILDREN NEED. IN RESPONSE TO THE FEES A MOVE THAT IN THE LONG RUN LEAVES CHILDREN REQUIRING MORE COSTLY STATE FUNDED SERVICES. DEPENDING ON INCOME THE FEE IS EITHER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR WHICH MAIN SEEM SMALL BUT IS UNATTAINABLE FOR MANY AND MAYBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHILD ACCESSING SERVICES AND NOT. ONE OF THE PRIMARY DROPS OF REGIONAL CENTERS IS TO MAKE THE LIVES OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES EASIER. THESE POLICIES FOR SOME TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS AND OTHER CRITICAL FAMILY MR CITIES. BOTH PROGRAMS WERE ESTABLISHED AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE WAS FACING BUDGETARY CHALLENGES. AND THE PROGRAMS WERE SHORT SIGHTED SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE LED TO FAMILIES FOR GOING SERVICES THAT THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN NEED. AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO JENNIFER BLOOM TO PROVIDE SOME REAL WORLD EXAMPLES. HELLO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY -- I AND MY NAME IS JENNIFER BLOOM I'M FROM ALTA CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER I AM A CLIENT SERVICES MANAGER OF A CHILDREN'S UNIT SERVING CHILDREN AGES -- THREE TO EIGHTEEN BEEN DOING THAT FOR FOUR YEARS AND PRIOR TO THAT I WAS A SERVICE COORDINATOR IN THE CHILDREN'S UNIT FOR SEVEN YEARS. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN THE FAMILY HOME IN ASKING FAMILIES FOR THEIR TAX RETURNS AND IT'S VERY INTRUSIVE -- FAMILIES ARE RESISTANT TO PROVIDE THEIR TAX RETURNS TO THE REGIONAL CENTER THAT'S PRIVATE INFORMATION SO IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE FOR MANY FAMILIES TO DO SO -- AND WE FOUND IN. IN THAT THAT FAMILY SOMETIMES WILL DECLINE SERVICES ARE FOR GROWTH SERVICES BECAUSE OF THEIR ARE ASSESSED A FEE AS AMY STATED THEY MAY NOT FIND THAT THAT FEE FITS INTO THEIR BUDGET. AND THEN THEY MAY DECLINE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE ASSESSED. I NEED. FOR SO -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEEN THAT TO BE A DETERRENT -- FAMILIES. YOU KNOW. WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE MAKING DECISIONS ON SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILD BASED UPON A FEE. AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN. OF OTHER TESTIMONY IN FAVOR PLEASE.

CALIBRATION ROLE MEN'S ACCESSIBILITY TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE BY CREATING A STATE AND COUNTY PARTNERSHIP TO SIR CLEAR AND A CALAVERAS ACCOUNTABLE STATEWIDE ENROLLMENT GOALS. IT'S SIMPLE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ENROLLMENT FOR ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. AND TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO THE CALIBRATION ROMAN PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY SB -- TWO EIGHTY FIVE SUCH AMBITIOUS BUT ACHIEVABLE PARTICIPATION GOALS. STARTING WITH THE PLAN TO ENROLL AT LEAST 75% OF NEWLY ELIGIBLE SSI RECIPIENTS WITHIN THE FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. OF THE ELIGIBILITY EXPANSION AND AIMING TO REACH 95% STATEWIDE ENROLLMENT WITHIN FIVE YEARS -- IT WILL ENSURE THE CLIENTS CAN STORE AND COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS. BY PHONE ONLINE IN PERSON OR BY MAIL REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IT WILL DIRECT THE STATE TO PROVIDE TIMELY AND ACCURATE TRANSLATIONS OF IT AN INTERPRETATION TO ENSURE. EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS. I WILL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IT WILL ENSURE AVAILABLE AND RELEVANT DATA IS COLLECTED AND MADE AVAILABLE FOR EQUITY ANALYSIS TO INFORM PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. AND IT WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE MULTI PROGRAM PORTAL TO APPLY TO NOT JUST CAL FRESH BUT CALPERS MEDI CAL CAL WORKS IN WITH FOR FOUR POINT ONE MILLION. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE CURRENTLY GOOD IN CIRCLES IF YOU'D GOOD AND SECURE. IN CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA IS AMONG THE LOWEST PERFORMING STATES IN TERMS OF CONNECTING HOUSEHOLDS. THE FEDERAL FOOD ASSISTANCE WITH THREE IN TEN ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS NOT RECEIVING THE BENEFITS A CALPERS WHICH IS OUR LARGEST AND MOST IMPACTFUL ANTI HUNGER PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA RANKS FOURTH TO LAST THE NUMBER FORTY SEVEN IN CONNECTING WORKING POOR HOUSEHOLDS AND AND RANKS LAST IN CONNECTING SENIORS TO A CALPERS PROGRAM. DESPITE RECENT CHANGES CHANGES TO THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. CALIFORNIA STILL FAILS TO REACH FOUR OUT OF FIVE ELIGIBLE SENIORS. A LARGE BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE FAILURE OF CALIFORNIA'S TO REACH ELIGIBLE PEOPLE IS DUE TO ADMINISTRATIVE DESIGN THAT DOES NOT CONSIDER THE COGNITIVE EMOTIONAL AND ATTENTIONAL COSTS THAT PEOPLE WITH FINANCIAL INSTABILITY FACE. ALL ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE -- OR THE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS HELLO FRESH WITH EASE. I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS IS A BILL THAT -- THERE'S BEEN SOME PUSH BACK BECAUSE IN YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE A IS GOING TO TAKE SOME WORK WE UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT. EASY TO INCREASE -- THE ENROLLMENT FOR CALIBRATION BUT IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO CALIFORNIA HAS SUCH A LOW UPTAKE ON CALPERS. SB TWO EIGHTY FIVE IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES A. R. P.. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND THE SAN FRANCISCO MARIN FOOD BANK. WE ARE BROAD SUPPORT AMONG OF THE FOOD ACCESS COMMUNITY. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY OR TRACY PATTERSON FROM CALIFORNIA TO POLICY ADVOCATES AND FRANCESCA ACOSTA FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO MARIN FOOD BANK.
