00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.586
BEGIN THE WORK OF SIGNIFICANT

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:02.421
CHANGE AND REINVENTION FOR THIS

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.457
IMPORTANT PUBLIC FACING STATE

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:05.558
AGENCY.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.160
IN ORDER TO CREATE THE DMV OF

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:09.061
THE FUTURE THE STRIKE TEAM IS

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:10.797
ALREADY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.399
DELIVERING SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.067
THE WAY THEY WANT THEM.

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:17.503
EASY AFFECTIVE AND ACCESSIBLE.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.639
WE ALL KNOW THE DMB IS GRAPPLING

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.375
WITH TO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES REAL

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:23.843
ID AND MOTOR VOTER.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.978
REAL ID HAS A FAST APPROACHING

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:28.414
DEADLINE EVERY CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.183
NEEDS TO FLY OR ENTER A SECURE

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.918
FEDERAL FACILITY OR MILITARY

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:32.819
BASE.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:34.353
AND DOES NOT HAVE A VALID

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.124
PASSPORT MUST HAVE A REAL ID BY

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.625
OCTOBER.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.027
TWENTY TWENTY GETTING A REAL ID

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:43.596
REQUIRES A VISIT TO A DMV FIELD

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:45.565
OFFICE AND WHILE THERE'S NO WAY

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.334
AROUND THAT VISIT WE ARE ALREADY

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.169
WORKING ON SEVERAL EFFORTS WHICH

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:51.537
I WILL DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.206
IN A MOMENT. TO GET AS MANY

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:55.675
CALIFORNIANS WHO KNEW OR THE

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:58.277
DEADLINE WITHOUT INCREASING

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.713
FIELD OFFICE WAIT TIMES.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.215
MOTOR VOTER IS ANOTHER AREA

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.183
WHERE WE BELIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.885
ARE WITHIN REACH AS THE DMB

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:08.321
IMPROVES ITS TRAINING CUSTOMER

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.189
SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.458
AS WITH ANYTHING ONE CHANGE IS

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.961
NOT A SILVER BULLET THERE NEEDS

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.596
TO ME MANY SILVER POINTS THE

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.097
STRIKE TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING ON

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.299
A SERIES OF ACTIONS TOGETHER.

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.568
I BELIEVE WHICH WILL BRING NEW

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.803
WAYS OF OPERATING BOTH

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.838
INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY TO THE

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:26.906
DMV.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:29.075
THESE MAY START WITH ONE FOCUS

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.610
BUT WILL THEN BE ABLE TO BE

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:32.745
CARRIED THROUGH ALL CORNERS OF

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.046
THE ORGANIZATION.

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:35.348
THE FIRST ACTION OF THE STRIKE

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:36.849
TEAM WAS TO MEET WITH SENIOR

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.751
LEADERS OF THE DMV TO LEARN

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:39.919
ABOUT THEIR WORK AND THEIR

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:40.953
CHALLENGES.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.656
WE ALSO CREATED AN ONLINE INTAKE

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:45.091
FORM.

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:47.693
EXCUSE ME ON THE GOV UPS WEBSITE

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.263
FOR DIEM BE EMPLOYEES AND ANY

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:52.231
MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO AT THEIR

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:55.234
DISCRETION PROVIDE INPUT AND

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:56.569
SHARE IDEAS WITH THE STRIKE TEAM.

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:57.637
WE'VE BEEN GATHERING THAT

00:08:57.703 --> 00:08:59.538
INFORMATION AND PASSING ON TO

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.974
THE DMV WHERE APPROPRIATE FOR

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.209
THEIR ACTIONS.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.278
THE STRIKE TEAM ALSO REVIEWED

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.880
THE DEPARTMENT'S IT CAPACITY TO

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.582
ASSESS THE READINESS OF THE

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:10.917
DMV'S ENVIRONMENT TO

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:12.551
SUCCESSFULLY MODERNIZE THEIR

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:14.220
DELIVERY OF SERVICES.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:15.321
THE STRIKE TEAM IS STARTING THE

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.290
PROCESS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.125
MANAGEMENT TO BUILD A CULTURE OF

00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:20.960
EMPLOYEE EMPOWERED CUSTOMER

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.061
SERVICE.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.429
THIS WILL INCLUDE BUILDING THE

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.665
IT CAPACITY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.033
HUMAN AND TECHNICAL

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.701
INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED ON

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.036
SERVICE DELIVERY.

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:32.872
SECURITY AND RELIABILITY.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.241
WE WERE ALSO CONFRONTED WITH

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.742
SEVERAL VACANCIES AND I'M

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:38.711
PLEASED THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:40.579
APPOINTED KATHLEEN WEB AS THE

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:42.782
ACTING DIRECTOR YOU WILL HEAR

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:43.916
FROM HER SHORTLY.

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:45.584
KATHLEEN WAS THE DIRECTOR OF

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:47.186
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT AT

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.422
GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY AND

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.357
HAS A RICH BACKGROUND IN RISK

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.059
MANAGEMENT LEAN PERFORMANCE

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:55.227
IMPROVEMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:56.896
MANAGEMENT.

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:58.297
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:00.666
THE STRIKE TEAM THAT THE STRIKE

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.768
TEAM IS ACTION ORIENTED WE HAVE

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:03.903
HAD MANY MEETINGS WITH

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.204
INTERESTED PARTIES DONE

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.973
EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND ARE NOW

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.208
CREATING RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.476
I'M GONNA START WITH CREDIT

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.078
CARDS IN THE FIELD OFFICES

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.346
SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR SPOKE

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:15.314
ABOUT IN HIS BUDGET ROLLOUT.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.182
I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:19.352
GOVERNOR NO SENSE THAT IN AN ERA

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:21.687
WHERE I CAN USE MY CREDIT CARD.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:24.557
AT A GIRL SCOUT COOKIE BOOTH BUT

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:26.225
I CAN'T USE IT A DMV FIELD

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.594
OFFICE. TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.396
WE'VE HAD MANY MEETINGS BOTH

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.264
WITH OUTSIDE ENTITIES AND WITH

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.200
THE DMV TEAM AND BELIEVE THE

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:36.469
ISSUES THAT PREVIOUSLY SEEMED TO

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:38.137
BLOCK THIS ACTION.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.573
ARE NOT OBSTACLES THAT WE CAN'T

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.508
OVERCOME WE ARE LOOKING ON A

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:44.677
PATH WE ARE WORKING ON A PATH

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.113
FORWARD AND EXPECT THE

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.247
GOVERNOR'S CHARGE.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.516
OF HAVING A CREDIT CARD OR

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.151
CREDIT CARD USE IN THE FIELD

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:53.786
OFFICES BY THE END OF THE YEAR

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.855
TO BE REALIZED. ONE OF OUR KEY

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.957
EFFORTS IS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.925
THE FIELD OFFICES IF THEY DON'T

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.193
NEED TO BE THERE.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.495
THAT MEANS INCREASING THE

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:04.030
ABILITY TO CONDUCT A DMB

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:05.998
BUSINESS AT OTHER LOCATIONS

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.467
WHETHER IT IS ONLINE OR AT A

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:11.103
KIOSK OR WITH A BUSINESS PARTNER.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.838
WE KNOW IN TODAY'S WORLD THE

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.907
FIRST PLACE PEOPLE GO TO GET

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.375
INFORMATION IS THE INTERNET.

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:17.610
THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO MAKE

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:19.879
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DMV WEBSITE

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:21.414
TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN EASILY

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.416
FIND THE INFORMATION THEY NEED.

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:24.950
SOME IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE LAST

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.419
SUMMER BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:28.454
WORK TO BE DONE WE LEARNED THAT

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.790
THE DMV WEBSITE HAS ELEVEN

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:31.724
THOUSAND PAGES.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.526
THAT'S HARDLY USER FRIENDLY.

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.461
A FULL WEBSITE OVER OVER HALL

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.329
WILL TAKE TIME BUT WE ARE

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:39.498
WORKING ON SHORT SHORT TERM

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:40.800
IMPROVEMENTS.

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.134
IF YOU CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU'RE

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:44.203
LOOKING FOR ON A WEBSITE THE

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.104
NEXT STEP IS YOU PICK UP THE

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:45.638
PHONE.

00:11:45.704 --> 00:11:47.139
WELL THAT EXPERIENCE HAS ALSO

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.774
BEEN FRUSTRATING TO DMB

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.509
CUSTOMERS THE STRIKE TEAM

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:52.078
BROUGHT IN THE FRANCHISE TAX

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:53.746
BOARD TO DO A THOROUGH REVIEW OF

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:56.816
DMV'S CALL CENTER PRACTICES.

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:59.452
AND SHARED BEST PRACTICES FTD

00:11:59.518 --> 00:11:59.952
STAFF.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:02.354
HAVE YOU EVALUATED THE PROCESSES

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:04.790
OF THE SACRAMENTO'S CALL CENTER

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.725
AND HAD HAVE VISITS SCHEDULED

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.327
THIS MONTH TO THE RIVER SIDE IN

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.662
THE FRESNO FACILITIES.

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:12.932
THESE REVIEW AND SHARED --

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:15.034
SEIZURES WILL HELP THE DMV

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.769
IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS AND

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.804
LOWER HOLD TIMES ADDITIONALLY WE

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.806
HOPE TO ADD MORE CAPABILITIES

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:23.375
SUCH AS CHAT BOTS LIVE CHAT.

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:24.810
AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.679
PROCESS MORE RE TREAT ROUTINE

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:29.682
TRANSACTIONS BY THE TELEPHONE

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:29.915
TREND --

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:31.750
TECHNICIANS.

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.219
IN ADDITION WE ARE PLANNING TO

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:34.386
EXPAND THE NUMBER OF SELF

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:36.889
SERVICE TERMINALS OR KIOSKS

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.591
AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.860
AND ADDING NEW SERVICES TO THOSE

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:44.130
KIOSKS THE FIRST FIX IS TO ADD

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:46.465
MORE LANGUAGES TO THE KIOSK

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:48.234
WHICH WAS PLANNED PREVIOUSLY --

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.269
TO THE STRIKE TEAM WE ALSO HOPE

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:52.171
TO ADD A HUNDRED SELF SERVICE

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.006
TERMINALS AT KEY LOCATIONS

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.174
THROUGHOUT THE STATE BY THIS

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:57.510
SUMMER AND ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:59.512
BY THE END OF THE YEAR

00:12:59.578 --> 00:12:59.812
[inaudible]

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:02.148
CURRENTLY KIOSKS PROCESS VEHICLE

00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:04.083
REGISTRATION RENEWALS BUT WE

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.818
HAVE LEARNED THAT THEY DOOM MANY

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:08.821
MORE FUNCTIONS AND OTHER STATES

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.022
FOR EXAMPLE THE ABILITY.

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:12.124
OF CHAOS TO ISSUE A REPLACEMENT

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.727
DRIVER'S LICENSE WOULD SAVE

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:16.695
THOUSANDS OF VISITS. TO THE

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:18.998
FIELD OFFICES AS OVER A MILLION

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.033
CALIFORNIANS WHO CALIFORNIANS

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.669
LOSE THEIR LICENSES ANNUALLY AND

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:25.638
HAVE TO GO INTO A FIELD OFFICE.

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:27.606
TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT AS I HAVE

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.475
SAID ONE OF OUR MAIN GOALS IS TO

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.944
REDUCE AVOIDABLE VISITS TO THE

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.546
FIELD OFFICE AS PART OF THE

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:35.481
STRATEGY THE STRIKE TEAM IS

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:36.815
WORKING WITH A PILOT TO BRING

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:39.285
THE DMV TO MAJOR COMPANIES.

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:41.086
IN THE STATE IN ORDER TO HELP

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.821
THEIR EMPLOYEES GET A REAL ID

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:45.424
THIS POP UP DMV IDEA IS DESIGNED

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.792
TO HELP OUR STATE'S BUSINESS

THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOME AT

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:45.958
SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE NOT

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:47.493
STRIKING.

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:49.728
THEIR LONGER TERM IN OPERATIONAL

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.996
CHANGES.

AND HUESO SO I I TAKE --

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:14.426
OF ONE OF ONE OF THE HERE IS THE

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:16.561

LONG AS I AM --

00:24:57.095 --> 00:25:01.333
LEGISLATOR I I THINK THAT --

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:02.334
I THINK THAT --

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.401
THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE

00:25:03.468 --> 00:25:06.471
HAVE THE DMV DOES --

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:08.340
I FOUND OUT.

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:09.474
I KNOW THE MEMBERS KNOW THIS BUT

00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:12.110
THERE'S A LOT OF PARTS OF THE

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:15.013
PENAL CODE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.449
THAT ACTUALLY PUNISH PEOPLE BY

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:19.918
TAKING THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.586
AWAY FROM THEM.

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:23.321
IF THEY'RE CONVICTED OF CERTAIN

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:25.023
CRIMES ARE ALLOWED JUDGES TO DO

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.124
THAT [inaudible]

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:31.229
AND I THINK.

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:33.632
PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR CRIME AND

00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:33.899
HAVING --

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:36.201
CONVICTED IF THEY'RE GUILTY IS

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:37.502
IMPORTANT.

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.437
I THINK PUNISH THEM BY TAKING

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:40.906
AWAY THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE.

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:44.576
IS A IS A WAY OF JUST MAKING OR

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:46.244
DMV HAVE MORE WORK TO DO.

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.847
SO I THINK --

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:52.751
I BETTER DO SOME BILLS ON NOT

00:25:52.817 --> 00:25:54.286
CHANGING THAT AND MAYBE.

00:25:54.352 --> 00:25:56.288
ST WELL WILL YOU KNOW WITHOUT

PENAL CODE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.227
WHETHER IT'S A MISDEMEANOR PHONE

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:03.662
OR ANY OF THAT KIND OF STUFF.

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:04.696
WHICH IS SAYING.

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:06.364
WE DON'T WANT TO USE THE PENAL

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:07.165
CODE.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.968
AND AND AND AND ALLOW THE DMV TO

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:11.336
BE BURDEN WITH US.

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:13.471
IMPLEMENTING THE PENAL CODE I

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:15.640
DON'T KNOW WITH PEOPLE.

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:16.574
HAVE EVEN NOTICE THIS ISSUE BUT

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.510
BUT I FOUND THAT.

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.412
IT'S LITERALLY IN THE MILLIONS

00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:21.846
OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:25.450
HAVE THIS PROCESS --

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:28.119
AS PART OF THEIR PUNISHMENT WHEN

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:29.821
THEY COMMIT A CRIME WHETHER IT'S

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:30.855
A MISDEMEANOR OR SOME OTHER KIND

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:31.489
OF CRIME.

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:32.857
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DO YOU --

00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:34.092

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.026
AUTOMOBILE.

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:38.363
TALKING ABOUT NON AUTOMOBILE.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.332
BASIC CRIMES IN ON THAT NOTHING

SO I THINK --

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:47.772
I THINK --

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:50.542
OF THOSE THOSE THINGS WILL BE

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:52.143

BECAUSE AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.949
OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO WE HAVE

00:26:58.016 --> 00:27:00.852

RIGHT I AGREE --

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:14.299
AND I THINK THAT --

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:14.866
THEY REQUIRE MORE STAFF MORE

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:18.436

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:48.792

SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE OFTEN

00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:53.530
UNDER VERY DEMANDING SITUATIONS

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:55.599
SUCH AS WORKING SIX DAYS A WEEK

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.567
AND SOME OF OUR OFFICES.

00:48:57.634 --> 00:48:59.369
LAST OCTOBER DMV SHARED WITH

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:00.737
THIS COMMITTEE THEIR ABSENTEEISM

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:03.640
RATE WAS CLOSE 230%.

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.809
THAT NUMBER WAS ALARMINGLY HIGH

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:06.877
WHICH THE COMMITTEE FOUND VERY

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:09.713
CONCERNING AND I CAN KERN.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.415
HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.716
THIS INFRMATION.

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:23.760
AT THE TIME THE ABSENT HE IS A

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:25.128
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MULTIPLE

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:26.596
FACTORS SUCH AS APPROVED TIME

00:49:26.663 --> 00:49:27.497
OFF.

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:29.366

CIVIC OR MILITARY DUTY AMONG

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:32.636
OTHER FACTORS.

00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:34.104
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF AN OFFICE

00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:35.172
ROSTER HAD TEN EMPLOYEES

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:36.707
SCHEDULED TO WORK THAT DAY BUT

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:38.041
ONLY EIGHT EMPLOYEES WERE

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:39.276
PRESENT.

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:40.844
THEN THE ABSENTEEISM RATE WAS

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:42.913
20%.

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.381
THIS WAS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:45.682
ABSENCE WAS SCHEDULED OR

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:47.284
UNSCHEDULED.

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:48.685
BECAUSE OF THIS METHODOLOGY THE

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:50.387
DEPARTMENT REPORTED A VERY HIGH

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:51.755
ABSENTEES ARRAY AND WE WERE

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:53.724
ASKED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.659
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.

00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:56.927
IN OUR EVALUATION OF OTHER

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:59.396
ABSENTEEISM METHODOLOGIES WE

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:01.198
DETERMINE AS MORE APPROPRIATE TO

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:03.033
REDEFINE ABSENTEEISM WITH THE

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.068
METRIC SIMILAR TO THAT USED BY

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:06.470
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL BUREAU

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:07.771

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.806
WHICH IS BASED ON ON SCHEDULED

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:11.208
ABSENCES.

00:50:11.274 --> 00:50:12.976
TOWARDS THAT END THE DMV'S FIELD

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:16.580

STARTING OCTOBER TWENTY SECOND

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:22.586
OF SINCE THEN THE AVERAGE

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:24.855
ABSENTEEISM RATE HAS BEEN SIX

00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:27.491
POINT 2%.

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:29.359
IN COMPARISON 230%.

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:31.128
THE SIX POINT 2% ABSENTEES ARRAY

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.596
PROVIDES BOTH RELIEF AND

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:35.265
REASSURANCE FOR DMV TO CONTINUE

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:36.233

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:38.769
LOWERED.

WE ALWAYS HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:35.772
THAT ARE COMING IN CLOSE TO THE

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:37.741
VERY I THINK NEXUS OF THEIR

00:54:37.807 --> 00:54:39.042
DEADLINE --

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.110
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.978
NON APPOINTMENT ACTIVITY THAT WE

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:43.947
HAVE TO ADDRESS --

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.649
THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE ARE

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:46.850
PUTTING OUT WHAT I CALL FULL

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:48.752
COURT EFFORT TO REALLY RAISE

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.353
AWARENESS REMIND PEOPLE.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.955
OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:52.522
HAVE IT IF THEY'RE GOING TO

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:54.057
TRAVEL CERTAINLY IF THEY HAVE A

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.792

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.827
TRAVEL WITH THEIR CURRENT

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:59.529
DRIVER'S LICENSE AND A PASSPORT --

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:00.730
PEOPLE MAY CHOOSE THAT THAT'S

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:02.032
NOT A WAY THAT THEY WANT TO

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.633
TRAVEL AFTER THEY START DOING

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.168
THAT SO WE ANTICIPATE.

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:08.004
PEOPLE MAY CHANGE THEIR IDEA OF

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:10.740
TRAVELING WITH BOTH DOCUMENTS TO

40% OF THOSE FOLKS ACTUALLY ALSO

THAT'S BEEN THE WHOLE

00:58:36.746 --> 00:58:38.681

I THINK I AM PROUD ABOUT --

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:06.949
LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:08.951
THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T GET

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.586
A DRIVER'S LICENSE --

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:11.754
TO THAT ISSUE GET CORRECTED IS

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.489
THAT COMPLETELY DONE WAS THE

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.457
SOURCE IDENTIFIED IN OUR WE

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:16.759
MOVING FORWARD IN CORRECTING

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.127
THAT BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW IF WE

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.795
CAN GET THAT RIGHT HOW READING

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:20.863
AT THE REAL ID THING RIGHT.

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.131
IF YOU COULD JUST COMMENT ON

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:24.833
SOME OF THAT PLEASE THAT THAT

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.602
MATTER HAS BEEN RESOLVED --

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:28.170
THE ROOT CAUSE OF THAT WAS

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:29.938
ACTUALLY DATING BACK TO SOME OF

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:32.341
OUR OLD CODING INFORMATION THAT

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:34.109
THE SECRETARY SPOKE ABOUT --

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:35.410
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:37.412
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FOR THE DMV

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:39.281
THAT DATES BACK TO PROBABLY THE

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:40.816
NINETEEN EIGHTIES --

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:42.050
I DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT ALWAYS

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:43.619
FULLY KNOW ALL THE CODES AND SO

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:45.020
ONE OF THINGS WE DISCOVERED WAS

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.989
A C THAT WAS EMBEDDED.

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:48.624
IN OUR DRIVER'S LICENSE RENEWAL

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:50.726
ACTIVITIES THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:52.528
ABOUT AND SO THAT TRIGGERED --

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.495
SOME ISSUES FOR US FROM A

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.230
PROCESSING STANDPOINT WE'RE ABLE

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:57.332
TO IDENTIFY THAT AFTER WE DID

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:58.867
SOME RECALLS ANALYSIS.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:00.302
WE'VE ACTUALLY FIX THAT ISSUE

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.171
AND WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:03.438
FOLKS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY IT

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.841
AND AS OF LAST WEEK WE ACTUALLY

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:07.142
HAD RESOLVED ALL OF THOSE

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.811
DRIVERS LICENSE ISSUES AND HAVE

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:10.312
MAILED OFF FOLKS ON DRIVER'S

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:11.513
LICENSE -- I

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.915
THINK YOU KNOW AS FAR AS YOUR

01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:15.083
CONCERNED DOES THIS HAPPEN AGAIN

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:16.451
I THINK WHAT WE'RE STRIVING TO

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:18.187
DO IS RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:19.755
DO MORE TESTING WHEN WE MAKE

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.356
CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM TO MAKE

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:22.825
SURE THAT WE'RE CATCHING.

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:24.960
SOME OF THE CODING ISSUES THAT --

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:26.461
FRANKLY STAFF WHO WERE OF ALL

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:27.830
THE CODING HAVE RETIRED OR NOT

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:31.433
PART OF THE STAFF ANYMORE --

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.302
AND DO WE HAVE THROUGH THE TEN

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:36.505
CHOOSE AS THAT.

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:37.306
BUT THAT'S REALLY PART O THE

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:38.140
OVERALL TECHNOLOGY

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:39.541
TRANSFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:40.776
UNDERTAKE --

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:42.110
YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL RELYING ON

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:43.912
KOBOL CODES IN THE SUMMER CODES

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.348
IT'S A VERY OLD AND DATED SYSTEM.

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.883
AND WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.651
TRANSFORMING THE DMV SYSTEM SO

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:53.188
IT CAN BE MORE AGILE TO RESPOND

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:54.389
TO THE NEEDS OF THE DMV.

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:56.725
I WAS THE ENVY MOVING TO THE

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:57.826
WHOLE FIRST CAL.

01:14:57.893 --> 01:14:59.695
OUR SYSTEM AS WELL OR NO.

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:00.729
WHERE ARE WE ON THE SCHEDULE FOR

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:01.930
THE NETWORK WE'RE CURRENTLY IN

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.432
THE DEFERRED DEPARTMENT FROM THE

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:04.833
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE?

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.268
FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.203
YOU'RE MOVING TOWARDS.

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.738
WE HAVE AN ORACLE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:12.207
FINANCIAL SYSTEM SOME WORMS CAL

01:15:12.274 --> 01:15:15.510
STARS OR THEIR CUSTOMERS OKAY

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:16.478
BUT I JUST THE ONE MORE QUESTION

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:17.880
ON A DIFFERENT ASPECT THAT YOU

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:18.847

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:21.283
THE WELLNESS PROGRAM AD THE

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.651
EMPLOYEES OF TURN UNDERSTAND.

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:23.919
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CULTURE

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:26.054
DMV.

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.356
YOU KNOW OUR WE HAVE A HUGE

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:29.458
WORKLOAD BEFORE US WE SEE THAT

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:31.026
COMING THERE'S BEEN ISSUES THAT

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:32.461
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ALONG THE

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:35.564
WAY WE HAVE A STRIKE TEAM NOW --

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:37.499
YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.835
WE SAY WE GRANTED ADDITIONAL

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:40.903
JUST FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE WE

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:43.105
GRANT AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.473
IN THE BUDGET BUT YOU KNOW DO WE

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:45.641
HAVE WORKERS THAT ARE.

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.075
WANTING TO DO THIS AND TACKLE

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:49.711
THIS OR IS THERE A SENSE OF

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:50.746
FEELING OVERWORKED AND IT'S

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:51.380
THAT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.515
BARRIER FOR US GETTING ALL THIS

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:54.416
WERE COMPLETED.

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:55.651
A TREMENDOUS AND A LITTLE BIT

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.786
ABOUT CULTURE DMV IN TERMS OF

01:15:57.853 --> 01:16:01.490
THE DIFFERENT OFFICES AND AND

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:03.325
THE TASK AHEAD OF US.

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.359
SO I CAN ONLY COMMENT ON MY

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:05.460
OBSERVATIONS THE LAST SIX WEEKS

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.062
BUT WHAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:09.631
IS MY IMPRESSION OF THE LEVEL OF

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:11.366
COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION THE

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:13.268
DMV EMPLOYEES IT'S IT REALLY IS

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:14.636
AMAZING AND IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:15.570
EVEN UNDER DIFFICULT

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.539
CIRCUMSTANCES AND SOMETIMES VERY

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:18.573
CRITICAL.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.542
REVIEWS OF THE DMV THESE FOLKS

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.177
COME TO WORK EVERY DAY REALLY

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.312
FOCUSED ON THE PURPOSE OF THEIR

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:25.180
JOB AND WANTING TO SERVE THEIR

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.581
CUSTOMERS OF THE VERY BEST

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.016
LEVELS THAT THEY CAN.

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.285
I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:31.486
TO GIVEN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:32.854
AND THE TOOLS SO THEY CAN

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:35.090
SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM THAT JOB

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:36.658
BECAUSE THEIR HEART IS THERE.

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:37.859
IT'S GIVING THEM I THINK THE

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.261
SKILLS AND THE CAPABILITY TO

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.762
DELIVER ON THAT MISSION.

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:41.897
BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:44.866
WAYS TO COME --

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.001
AND REALLY CELEBRATE THE

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.469
ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT ALSO REALLY

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:48.837
MAKE SURE WE'RE WORKING TO

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:50.138
IMPROVE HOW WE SERVE OUR

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:51.707
CUSTOMERS AND AS I SAID EARLIER

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.842
IT'S REALLY ABOUT BUILDING THAT

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:55.210
FUTURE DMV THAT BETTER SERVES

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.311
OUR CHILDREN BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:57.446
GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.047
BUT I WANTED THE DMV STAFF TO

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.682
GET EXCITED ABOUT THAT FUTURE

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.751
VISION AND LAYING THAT OUT IS

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:04.186
REALLY CREATED KIND OF A RALLY

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:06.989
CRY TO SAY HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:08.890
HAPPEN HOW CAN WE BE PART OF A

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.792
AND IF I CAN ADD TO THAT.

01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:12.160
IS WHILE.

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:13.462
TALKING TRACK FIELD OFFICE STAFF

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:16.064
DAILY TO SEE THEIR ENTHUSIASM IN

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.799
THE SUMMERTIME IS THAT A TOUGH

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:18.900
TIME FOR OUR EMPLOYEES.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.602
HE GREW THROUGH THAT AND THEY

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.871
HAVE A DEDICATED HEART AND SOUL

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.072
TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:25.007
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:26.208
THEY DON'T LIKE LONG WAIT LINES

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:27.709
JUST AS MUCH AS OUR CUSTOMERS

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:29.211
DON'T LIKE IT FROM A FROM A

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:30.445
STANCE WHEN THEY'RE SEEING THAT.

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:32.514

REALLY BE FOCUSING ON KIND OF

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:09.538
WHERE WE ARE NOW AND ISSUES ON

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:10.739
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:12.474
KEEP IN MIND AS WE'RE MOVING

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:13.175
FORWARD --

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.709
WE'RE GONNA --

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:17.145
ON CERTAIN AREAS THAT HAVE ALL

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:18.880
GET OVER THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.815
HEARD OF IT AT LENGTH IF YOU

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:21.149
HAVE COMMENTS.

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:21.983
YES.

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.118
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:23.952
YOUR HAND OUT WE'RE GOING TO

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:25.153

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.591
IMPLEMENTATION AND THE IMPACT ON

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:32.260
DMV OPERATIONS.

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:33.495
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.197
HAND OUT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:36.765
OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT FUNDING

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:37.866
THAT'S PROVIDED SO FAR AND I

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.401
THINK THIS THIS PAGE I'LL GO

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:41.102
INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DEPTH ON

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:42.103
AND SO --

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.738
GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:45.941
WORKLOAD THE STATE DID PROVIDE

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:47.075
LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR TWO

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:49.044
YEARS AND SPECIFICALLY IT WAS

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.644
TWENTY THREE MILLION FROM THE

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.580
MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT TO SUPPORT

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:52.714

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:58.853
FIFTY POSITIONS.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.188
IN.

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:00.789
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:02.924
ON TOP OF THAT THE TWO THOUSAND

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:03.425
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:05.227
INCLUDED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:07.028
THAT AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:09.798
OF FINANCE TO INCREASE THE

01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:11.233
AMOUNT PROVIDED DMV NO SOONER

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:13.435

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.304
AND THE TWO REQUESTS HAVE BEEN

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:17.072
SUBMITTED --

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:19.007
UNDER THAT AUTHORITY ONE HAS

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:21.876
BEEN APPROVED AND ONE IS STILL

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:22.677
PENDING.

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:23.445
THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:24.512
WITH THE SUBMITTED AND APPROVED

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.982
IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:27.983
EIGHTEEN IT WAS FOR SIXTEEN

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.484
POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:30.952
SUPPORT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:32.721
POSITIONS SO IN TOTAL THAT

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:36.057
BRINGS THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:38.026
ALLOCATION TO DMB TO SIXTY THREE

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:41.029

SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:42.931
POSITIONS.

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:43.865
THE SECOND AMOUNT WHICH IS

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:45.233
PENDING --

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.637
WAS SUBMITTED IN JANUARY OF TWO

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:49.237
THOUSAND NINETEEN AND IN THAT

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.405
REQUEST THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:52.207
FINANCE INDICATES THAT IT

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.908
INTENDS TO PROVIDE DMV WITH AN

01:21:53.975 --> 01:21:56.278
ADDITIONAL FORTY POINT FOUR

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:57.178
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:21:57.245 --> 01:22:01.182
NO SOONER THAN APRIL THIRTIETH.

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:02.083
EIGHTEEN AND THE DMV INDICATED

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.652
THAT THIS FUNDING WOULD BE USED

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.020
TO SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL ONE

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.488
HUNDRED AND TWENTY POSITIONS AS

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:07.856
WELL AS TO MAINTAIN ALL OF THE

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:09.157
ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'VE

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:10.892
IMPLEMENTED TO DATE TO BRING THE

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:14.329
WAIT TIMES DOWN.

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:16.131
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE.

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.065
WHEN WAS THAT SUBMITTED?

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:18.800
THE THE FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:22.137
WAS SUBMITTED IN JANUARY OF TWO

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:22.771
THOUSAND NINETEEN SO IT'S STILL

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:23.338
OUTSTANDING NOW [inaudible]

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:25.240
GOOD.

01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:26.675
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.143
YOUR HAND OUT THIS PROVIDES AN

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:30.245
OVERVIEW OF THE VARIOUS --

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.479
COMPONENTS RELATED TO THE

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.148
GOVERNOR'S NINETEEN TWENTY

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:35.550
BUDGET THAT IMPACTS THE DMV.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.285
SO THE FIRST AS THE DEPARTMENT

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:38.853
REFERENCED THERE IS A PLACE

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.456
HOLDER BUDGET REQUEST FOR SIXTY

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:42.223
THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION TO

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.591
SUPPORT SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:44.826
POSITIONS WHICH IS THE AMOUNT

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.628
THAT WE'VE PROVIDED SO FAR.

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.096
IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:48.963
HOWEVER THEY'VE CLEARLY

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:50.632
INDICATED THAT THIS REQUEST WILL

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:54.035
BE UPDATED AS DMV'S OPERATIONS

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.637
AND PROCESSES ARE EVALUATED.

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:57.605
AND THERE THEY ARE LOOKING TO

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:01.042
HAVE TWO EVALUATIONS INFORM THAT

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:02.711
ONE IS THE DMB REINFECTION

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:03.311
STRIKING WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:04.412
THE FIRST PANEL.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:05.680
BUT THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:06.881
PERFORMANCE AUDIT THAT'S BEING

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:08.450
CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:09.784
FINANCES OFFICE OF AUDITS AND

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:11.219
EVALUATION.

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:11.820
AND THAT WAS STARTED IN

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:14.055
SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:14.923
EIGHTEEN AND IT'S EXPECTED TO BE

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:18.393
COMPLETED BY THE END OF MARCH.

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.461
THE FINAL --

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:20.061
THING THAT WE WOULD BRING TO

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:21.663
YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT THE

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:22.831
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ACTUALLY

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:25.200
INCLUDES A NEW PROPOSAL FOR A

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.635
NEW OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:29.270
WHICH WOULD BE HOUSED WITHIN THE

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:31.339
GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY.

01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:33.408
AND THIS OFFICE IS REALLY TASKED

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:34.609
WITH --

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:37.479
REQUIREMENTS FOR A DIP AS FOR

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:38.880
DEPARTMENTS TO REASSESS THEIR

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.615
SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL TO LOOK

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.250
AT RE ENGINEERING CUSTOMER

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.252
SERVICE DELIVERY AND ALSO TO

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:44.953
LEVERAGE --

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.388
KIND OF DIGITAL INNOVATION

01:23:46.454 --> 01:23:49.090
THAT'S AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE.

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:50.692
AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:51.459
LEGISLATURE WILL BE CONSIDERING

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:52.627
AS PART OF ITS BUDGET

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.796
DELIBERATIONS.

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.197
AND THEY DID INDICATE THE DMB

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:56.998
WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:58.666
DEPARTMENTS TO WORK WITH THE

01:23:58.733 --> 01:24:00.201
OFFICE IF IT WAS APPROVED.

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:01.503
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR OF

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:03.138
YOUR HAND OUT --

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:04.539
IN EVALUATING THE GOVERNOR'S

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:05.540
BUDGET PROPOSALS WE DID

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:07.575
IDENTIFIES THREE ISSUES FOR

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:08.743
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:10.245
THEY MOVE FORWARD.

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:12.881
AND SO THE FIRST IS THAT A

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:14.382
NUMBER OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:15.917
THAT MAY BE FLAGGED IN THESE

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:17.919
HAVE VALUATIONS COULD GENERATE

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:19.921
LONG TERM SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.222
THE STATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:24.492
DMV OPERATES MORE EFFICIENTLY OR

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:26.027
IMPROVES ITS CUSTOMER SERVICES

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:28.696
HOWEVER SOME OF THESE CHANGES

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:30.432
MAY TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENT AND

01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:33.268
TIME TO ACTUALLY REALIZE ALL OF

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:33.968
THE BENEFIT.

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:35.670
AS THE LEGISLATURE MAY REALLY

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.739
WANT TO CONSIDER FOCUSING ON

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:39.340
CHANGES THAT CAN GENERATE MORE

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:41.042
IMMEDIATE IMPACT BECAUSE OF THE

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:42.477
OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:43.745
AND THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.647
THAT MAY BE COMING IN.

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:46.514
WHICH WILL LIKELY MEAN THAT

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.516
DMV'S WORK A LEVELS ARE AT LEAST

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.352
SIMILAR IF NOT HIGHER AND SO THE

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:54.656
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:56.257
CONSIDER THEIR HEART.

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:57.225
YES FOR MONTHS PLEASE I WAS

01:24:57.292 --> 01:24:58.393
TRYING TO GET THAT NUMBER.

01:24:58.460 --> 01:24:58.960
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.328
HIGHER.

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:01.396
YES AND SO AN EXAMPLE THAT WE

01:25:01.463 --> 01:25:02.464
WOULD GIVE HERE IS THAT IT'S

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:03.798
POSSIBLE THAT ADDITIONAL OR

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.200
IMPROVED OUTREACH EFFORTS COULD

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:06.935
REALLY IMPROVE THE NUMBER OF

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:08.269
PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.238
FIELD OFFICES WITH ALL OF THEIR

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:11.005
PAPERWORK.

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:12.440
COMPLETED ALL NECESSARY

01:25:12.507 --> 01:25:13.575
PAPERWORK COMING IN WITH THEM

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:15.610
AND I WOULD REALLY REDUCE THE

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:17.779
OVERALL TRANSACTION TIME PER

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:19.280
INDIVIDUAL.

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:20.882
THE SECOND ISSUE OF THE

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.083
LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER IS

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:23.485
REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.220
FINANCE AND THE DMV REINVENTION

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.222
STRIKE TEAM TO REPORT IN THE

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:28.723
SPRING AT HEARINGS.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.425
ON ALL OF THE OPERATIONAL

01:25:30.492 --> 01:25:31.292
EFFICIENCIES AND CHANGES THAT

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:32.760
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED STATE AND

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.429
THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:36.431
TO EVALUATE AND EXAMINE ALL OF

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:37.765
THEM NOT JUST THE ONES THAT HAVE

01:25:37.832 --> 01:25:38.700
BEEN SELECTED BY THE

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:40.969
ADMINISTRATION FOR INCLUSION IN.

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:42.737
THE UPDATED BUDGET PROPOSAL AND

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:43.972
THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:45.340
WHICH OF THESE --

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:47.208
OR OTHERS IT WOULD LIKE TO

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:49.244
INCLUDE THIS IS PARTICULARLY

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.812
IMPORTANT GIVING THE PENDING

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.680
INSOLVENCY OF THE MOTOR EHICLE

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:56.017
COUNT WHICH SUPPORTS BOTH DMV AS

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:56.584
WELL AS A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:57.785
PATROL.

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:59.687
AND FINALLY REGARDLESS OF

01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:02.323
HOWEVER MUCH MONEY IS PROVIDED --

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:03.958
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:05.727
CONSIDER WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:07.595
LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT IT'S

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:10.064
INTERESTED IN AND SO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:13.201
I AM I REFERENCE THE PENDING.

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.169
FORTY REQUEST THAT'S OUTSTANDING

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:17.205
WHEN THAT REQUEST CAME IN IN

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:18.840
JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:20.208
DMV INDICATED THAT A PORTION OF

01:26:20.275 --> 01:26:21.042
THE FUNDING THAT THEY WERE

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:22.377
REQUESTING HAD ALREADY BEEN

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:23.111
SPENT.

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:24.412
AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:25.580
TO CONSIDER WHETHER DIRECTING

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:29.951
THE DEPARTMENT TO ACTUALLY SEEK

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.853
SPENDING OR INCREASING COSTS OF

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.421
THE LEGISLATURE CAN DETERMINE

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:34.656
THE REASONS FOR THOSE COSTS

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:36.925
INCREASE AND AND WHAT ACTIONS IF

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:37.625
ANY.

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:39.327
THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.461
TAKE MOVING FORWARD.

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:41.529
AND SO WITHOUT WILL CONCLUDE OUR

01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:42.630
COMMENTS WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.299
ANY QUESTIONS WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.935
NORMAL PROCESS FOR THEM TO

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:49.270
REQUEST A BUDGET [inaudible]

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:51.139
OF ADDITION.

01:26:51.205 --> 01:26:52.907
IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THEY START

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:54.275
SPEND THE MONEY AND THEN THEY

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:55.810
COME IN AFTERWARDS AND ASKED FOR

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:56.311
IT.

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:58.179
OF WHAT WOULD BE THE NORMAL

01:26:58.246 --> 01:26:59.447
PROCEDURE.

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:01.282
SO THERE ARE --

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.751
SIDE THERE'S LANGUAGE IN TOWARDS

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:04.953
THE BACK OF THE BUDGET BILL

01:27:05.019 --> 01:27:06.087
WHICH WE CALL --

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:08.556
CONTROL SECTIONS AND SO THERE'S

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:10.291
A SECTION LETTER PROCESS. FOR

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:12.627
WHICH REQUESTS CAN BE SUBMITTED

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.195
USUALLY --

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:15.430
DEPARTMENTS MAY SAY THERE'S AN

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:18.466
UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES ETCETERA --

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:20.268
THE LEGISLATURE CAN ALSO BUILD

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:22.003
IN LANGUAGE AS PART OF THE

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.838
BUDGET AND SO THE TO REQUEST

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:25.573
THAT I TALKED ABOUT ARE ACTUALLY

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.975
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WAS

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:29.444
BUILT IN AS PART OF DMV'S

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:32.647
BUDGETARY ALLOCATION THE FOR THE

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:36.184
RULES THIS TIME OR WAS IT --

01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:38.052
GRAY LINE.

01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:39.454
WAS THE RULES FAULT.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.688
BUDGET RULES.

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:41.689
SO I'VE THAT SO IN TERMS OF THE

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:42.924
FIRST ONE THE SIXTEEN POINT SIX

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:44.292
MILLION THAT --

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:44.993
ONE KIND OF WENT THROUGH THE

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:46.227
ROUTINE PROCESS AND IT WAS

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:47.328
APPROVED THERE WERE SOME

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:48.630
CONCERNS --

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:49.564
THAT WERE RAISED TO JUST IN

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:53.001
TERMS OF JUST FORWARD WHAT

01:27:53.067 --> 01:27:54.636
ACTIONS WERE BEING TAKEN --

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:56.471
OVERSIGHT ABOUT WAIT TIMES

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:58.640
EXCITE OR A ON THE SECOND ONE

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.308
IT'S A IT'S A MUCH LARGER

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:01.776
REQUEST IT'S FORTY POINT FOUR

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.411
MILLION DOLLARS --

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:04.445
I THINK THAT THERE'S LESS

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:07.348
CONCERNED ABOUT PROCESS --

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:09.384
IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:10.451
THAT'S PROVIDED I THINK THERE IS

01:28:10.518 --> 01:28:11.619
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN AS

01:28:11.686 --> 01:28:13.588
WE INDICATED FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:15.123
TO THINK MOVING FORWARD.

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:17.191
ABOUT WHAT STAGE IS APPROPRIATE

01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:18.860
FOR THE DEPARTMENT THOSE WHO

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.561
COME FORWARD OR RELIEVE THE

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:21.596
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS SO WHEN

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:22.764
THEY SUBMITTED THE REQUEST THAT

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:24.632
WAS THE ONE WHERE A PORTION OF

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:26.434
IT THEY HAD ALREADY SPENT THE

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:27.435
DOLLARS TO SO.

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:28.269
I WOULD SAY APPROXIMATELY HALF

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:29.737
OF IT HAD BEEN SPENT IN THE

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.372
FIRST SIX MONTHS SPENT ABOUT

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:33.341
TWENTY MILLION A LITTLE BIT LESS

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:33.708
THAN THAT YEAH.

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.443
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN APPROVED BY

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.544
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:40.415
I IT IS GAS SO THAT THE DATE IS

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:42.717
APRIL THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:43.418
NINETEEN IN WHICH ACTION WE NEED

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:44.085
TO BE TAKEN AS THEY'RE GOING TO

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:47.822
BE ANOTHER ONE ANTICIPATED IN

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:48.890
THIS FISCAL YEAR.

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:49.557
THAT IS A QUESTION THAT'S

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:50.892
PROBABLY BETTER DIRECTED TO THE

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.360
DEPARTMENTS THEY CAN ANSWER THE

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:53.561
QUESTION.

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:54.495
YEAH BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THEIR

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:55.763
INTENTION IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.565
NOT THEY PLAN ON SUBMITTING

01:28:57.632 --> 01:28:58.266
WHILE WORKING WITH THE PART IN A

01:28:58.332 --> 01:28:59.967
FINANCED OR TO GET A HANDLE ON

01:29:00.034 --> 01:29:01.569
THIS.

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:03.137
YOU KNOW EVERY THREE MONTHS

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:05.139
ASKING FOR MONEY THING THAT'S

01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:07.575
GOING ON HERE SO SO.

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:09.444
AND HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD BE THAT

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:12.080
WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY.

01:29:12.146 --> 01:29:13.881
AND THEN WHAT IS THE OVER YOU

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:16.617
KNOW LIKE OVERALL BUDGET REQUEST

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.219
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO THE

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:19.787
LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A CLEARER

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:22.190
PICTURE ON THE SUBJECT.

01:29:22.256 --> 01:29:23.958
ABOUT WHAT THE MONEY SITUATION

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:26.127
AS WE NEED TO HAVE A PROCESS

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.429
IT'S PRETTY.

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:31.032
CLEAR FOR US --

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:32.366
WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE LAST TO

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:33.000
KNOW IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:34.102
WAY.

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:37.138
YES I AM AS PART OF OUR BUDGET

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:39.407
WORKLOAD APRIL AND MAY WHICH

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:41.008
WHICH YOU'RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH.

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:43.344
WE WILL EVALUATE THE UPDATED

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:44.779
PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:45.980
CLEARLY INDICATED THERE'S AN

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.615
UPDATED PROPOSAL COMING.

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.050
AND SO WE WOULD EVALUATE THAT

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:51.886
ALONG WITH WHAT CHANGES --

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:52.887
THE DEPARTMENT OR THE

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:55.423
ADMINISTRATION HAS IN MIND THAT

01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:57.258
A COMPANIES THAT REQUEST YOU

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:59.594
THINK THAT THE THAT THE CURRENT

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:03.464
STATUS OF DONE SO FAR.

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:04.565
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:08.636
THE REAL ID APPLICATIONS.

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:11.205
ARE BY THE DEADLINE.

01:30:11.272 --> 01:30:13.341
IN THE UPDATED REQUESTS TO WE

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:15.743
WOULD LOOK AT THEIR FORECASTING

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.078
METHODOLOGY I THINK FROM THE

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:18.913
DISCUSSION HERE TODAY THEY ARE

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:19.714
WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:22.250
FINANCE IN REVISITING THAT --

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:23.718
AND SO WE WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT

01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:24.986
THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DISCUSSION

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:26.788
WITH THEM AND SO AT THAT POINT

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:27.488
WE WOULD BE.

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:29.123
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:30.558
ADVISE YOU.

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:31.592
IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF

01:30:31.659 --> 01:30:32.827
RESOURCES IWOULD READ THE

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.162
REASON WHY I'M ASKING --

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:36.264
IS THAT.

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:37.665
IT SEEMS LIKE --

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:40.034
SUCH A LARGE GAP.

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:42.236
THAT IT MAY BE A VERY COSTLY

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:44.238
REQUEST.

01:30:44.305 --> 01:30:45.339
AND I THINK HAVING A SURPRISE

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:47.241
LAKE -- TWO

01:30:47.308 --> 01:30:49.610
WEEKS BEFORE I APPROVAL OF A

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:50.244
HUNDRED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.145
DOLLARS.

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:53.114
WOULD NOT BE A VERY NICE THING

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:53.681
TO DO THAT THE LEGISLATURE I

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:55.449
THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:56.450
WE HAVE.

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:58.786
SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE

01:30:58.853 --> 01:30:59.854
AND MAGNITUDE.

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:04.659
OF WHAT THE REQUEST MIGHT BE --

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:06.194
I TRIED TO GET THE INFORMATION --

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.362
WILL TRY TO GET IT MORE BUT I

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:08.963
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR OPINION

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:12.266
AS WHAT SCOPE AND MAGNITUDE YOU

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:14.335
THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE.

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:15.870
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THERE'S

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:20.808
REALLY TWO LEVERS THAT YOU POLL --

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.977
THERE IS THE THE THE SALARY AND

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:24.512
EMPLOYEES IN TERMS OF HERE'S THE

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:26.147
WORKLOAD WE'RE NOT CHANGING

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:27.381
ANYTHING ELSE THIS IS WHERE

01:31:27.448 --> 01:31:29.050
WE'RE OPERATING --

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:30.918
HERE'S A LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.587
WILL BE NEEDED --

01:31:32.653 --> 01:31:33.654
I THINK FROM THE DISCUSSION

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:35.690
TODAY THERE'S CLEAR RECOGNITION

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:36.991
THAT THE SECOND LEVER WHICH

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:38.426
NEEDS TO BE CHANGED WHICH IS

01:31:38.492 --> 01:31:41.495
THIS ISSUE OF EFFICIENCY IS AN

01:31:41.562 --> 01:31:43.130
OPERATIONAL CHANGES.

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:46.868
AND THAT WILL LIKELY NEED ON

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:48.002
THAT OTHER SIDE IN TERMS OF

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:49.637
EMPLOYEES AND STAFF I THINK

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.405
THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:52.340
ARE IN PROGRESS WE'VE HEARD OF

01:31:52.406 --> 01:31:53.507
THINGS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:54.575
IDENTIFIED IN THAT HAVE BEEN

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:56.110
IMPLEMENTED --

01:31:56.177 --> 01:32:00.281
ALL OF WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL --

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:02.516
BUT REALLY THAT KIND OF LEADS TO

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:03.851
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.586
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:06.888
POTENTIALLY CONSIDER WHICH IS.

01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:08.656
WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:10.591
CHANGES WHAT CHANGES --

01:32:10.658 --> 01:32:12.126
HOW WILL HAVE KIND OF IMMEDIATE

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:14.195
IMPACT BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE THIS

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:17.398
LOOMING DEADLINE OF OCTOBER?

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:18.933
TWENTY TWENTY AND WHAT WERE YOU

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:19.967
KNOW IN THE PROCESS OF FIGURING

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:22.203
OUT THE EXACTION NUMBERS WE DO

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:23.604
KNOW THAT GIVEN TO DATE.

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:24.939
WHETHER IT'S TWO POINT FIVE OR

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:26.707
THREE MILLION INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:29.210
COME FORWARD YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:29.844
A NUMBER.

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:30.811
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:32.446
INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL COME FORTH

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:36.417
BEYOND YOU JUST THE NORMAL CYCLE

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:37.018
OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DOING

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.786
RENEWALS THE REASON I'M ASKING

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.688
THESE QUESTIONS IS YOU.

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:43.624
I THINK WHICH IS FOCUS ON THE

01:32:43.691 --> 01:32:44.458
MEDIA TRY.

01:32:44.525 --> 01:32:46.260
TO DEAL WITH --

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:47.161
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:50.264
A STEADY.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:51.532
NUMBER OR SOMETHING IS GONNA

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.935
SEARCH AT THE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.503
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:57.738
AT WHAT THE PROBABILITY THAT

01:32:57.805 --> 01:32:57.939
WILL.

01:32:58.005 --> 01:32:59.307
BE HAPPENING.

01:32:59.373 --> 01:33:02.743
UP TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:04.578
GONNA.

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:07.381
WANT TO HAVE THE REAL ID'S.

01:33:07.448 --> 01:33:08.416
BUT THEN FIND THAT --

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:10.384
THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:12.553
AT THE END BECAUSE OF A JUST --

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.855
BREAK DOWN BECAUSE OF THE HUGE

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.457
SURGE THAT TAKES PLACE.

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:18.025
THAT'S BY.

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:22.964
pTHINK THAT --

01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:24.732
WE WANT.

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:26.767

01:33:26.834 --> 01:33:29.971
APPROPRIATELY AND DO WITH THAT --

01:33:30.037 --> 01:33:34.375
BY BOTH MONEY SOLUTION WE HAVE

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.410
TO HAVE AN EFFICIENCY SOLUTION.

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:39.814
FOR THAT AND OF I THINK.

TO BE TARGETED.

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:49.724
THE COULD SAVE US THE MOST MONEY

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.727

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:09.837
RELATED TO A SUPPLEMENTAL PETE.

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:10.704
IT'S NOT REALLY LAUNCH --

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:12.473
IT'S IT'S A PAYMENT SCHEDULE

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.175

VARIOUS SPECIAL FUNDS AND S ONE

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:23.584
SOLUTION IS TO KIND OF DELAY OR

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:24.618
CHANGE.

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:25.886
ON THAT SCHEDULE FOR THE MOTOR

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:27.254
VEHICLE COUNT.

01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:28.689
THE OTHER ONE IS TO POTENTIALLY

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:30.091
ELIMINATE THIS GENERAL FUND

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:31.592

FUND ONE WAS.

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:45.973
WITH THE USE OF FOR WELL WHEN

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:46.974
IT'S THAT THEY GIVE A PURPOSE

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:47.575
SERVICES GENERALLY JUST DONE

01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:49.443

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:01.722
THIS MONEY AND THEN SOMEBODY

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.591
ASKED THE QUESTION WHY OKAY LOW

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:04.925
THAT'S THE IN.

01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:06.961
QUESTION I WOULD HAVE WELL WHY

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:08.395
WAS IT TRANSFER.

01:36:08.462 --> 01:36:10.531
THERE WAS A REASON.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:12.032
OKAY WE GOT ANOTHER HEALTHCARE

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:13.534
ANTHONY SYMBOL FROM THE LA OKAY

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:16.504
THOUSAND NINE TEN AND IT REALLY

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:18.172
WAS SORT OF A ONE TIME THE FIRST

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:18.672
YEAR.

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:19.840
BECAUSE THE STATE'S FISCAL

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:20.841
CONDITION AT THE TIME IN THESE

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:21.375
ARE.

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:23.477
REVENUES THAT ARE RESTRICTED BY

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:24.812
THE CONSTITUTION UNLIKE THE

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:26.947
WHEN YOU'RE THERE WITH A

01:36:27.014 --> 01:36:28.249
DIFFERENT ANOTHER ONE TIME BASIS

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:29.350
BUT IDEA WAS IT WAS POSSIBLY

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:30.384
TEMPORARY.

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:33.220
BUT AFTER A WHILE WE JUST THAT

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:36.090
ARE DOING ON ONGOING BY BUDGET

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:37.758
AXES TO DO THIS FOR YOU HOW THE

01:36:37.825 --> 01:36:39.260

VEHICLE ACCOUNT.

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:42.329
THAT WITHOUT HELP THE SOLVENCY

01:36:42.396 --> 01:36:43.898
ISSUE.

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:44.565
IT WILL COMPLETELY SOBER BUT IT

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:45.933
WILL HELP.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.336
OKAY SO SO IF THERE'S A FURTHER

01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:52.339
BUDGET REQUEST OTHER THAN THIS.

01:36:52.406 --> 01:36:54.909
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:56.610
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE COMING THIS

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:59.647
FISCAL YEAR MAYBE AND THEN --

01:36:59.713 --> 01:37:01.315
THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE NEXT

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:02.116
FISCAL YEAR.

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.350
WITH THOSE --

01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:04.418
WITH THAT COME OUT OF THE MOTOR

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:05.519
VEHICLE FINER HOW WOULD THAT

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:06.020
WITH THOSE --

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:08.155
REQUEST BEFORE CORRECT --

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:08.522
LIKE --

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:10.090
MISLI MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:11.292
BUDGET DOES HAVE A PLACE HOLDER

01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:12.459
FOR THE WRITING WAIT TIMES THE

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:14.161
EXTENT ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:16.163
SPEND MORE THAN THAT LEVEL.

01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:17.665
THAT WILL COME FROM IN VA.

01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:18.365
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SECRETARY

01:37:18.432 --> 01:37:20.234
ABOUT DIFFERENT IDEAS HAVING

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.503
MORE KIOSK HAVING MORE STAFF

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:23.604
THAT'S ALL GOING TO COME FROM

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:25.105
BECAUSE OF THE MV UNLESS YOU

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:26.507
FIND SOME OF THE FUND SOURCE?

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:27.608
I WOULD ALSO NOT EVEN THE IDEA

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:28.642
OF USING CREDIT CARD

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:31.078
TRANSACTIONS CURRENTLY WHEN WE

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:35.416
DO WHEN --

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:35.983
PORT CERVICAL ONLINE WITH A

01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:38.619
CREDIT CARD AND WE'RE GONNA

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.621
CONTINUE THAT PRACTICE AND ALLOW

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:41.488
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AND

01:37:41.555 --> 01:37:42.556
FILLED OFFICE.

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:43.324
IN THE STATE PICKED UP THE

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:44.558
TRANSACTION BECAUSE THAT'S

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:46.427
ANOTHER HIT TO THEM VIA TO THE

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:47.027
EXTENT IT'S PAID FOR FROM THE

01:37:47.094 --> 01:37:47.962
MPA.

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:51.332
JUST JUST --

01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:53.367
MY FILL ALL PHILOSOPHICAL

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:57.071
APPROACH OF FOCUSING THE DMV ON

01:37:57.137 --> 01:37:58.806
CORE SERVICES ONLY.

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:00.474
AND GETTING RID OF SOME OF THE

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.710
STUFF LIKE I SAID THE PENAL CODE

01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:05.412
IN MAYBE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:09.717
OF REDUCING SOME OF THOSE OTHER

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:11.652
THINGS THAT THE DMV DOES. FOR

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.053
OTHER DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICE

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.288
SOMEBODY SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:19.193
THAT IS BUT WE HEARD THAT TODAY --

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.430
THE QUESTION WOULD BE CAN YOU.

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:24.765
IN YOUR ANALYSIS BEFORE WEEKS

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:26.700
RECEIVE THESE REQUESTS FOR

01:38:26.767 --> 01:38:28.836
BUDGET --

01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:31.338
GIVE US A PROJECTION OF HOW

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.706
THEY'RE GOING.

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:33.941
TO MEET THE DEADLINE FOR THE

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:36.176
REAL ID AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO

FREE UP.

01:40:17.878 --> 01:40:18.479
CAN ONLY DO ONE LOOK AT THE COST

01:40:18.545 --> 01:40:19.380
OF WHAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT ALSO

01:40:19.446 --> 01:40:20.347
WHAT ARE THE SAVINGS THEY EXPECT
