look. I like to encourage the

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:05.672
rule. That we have an instant

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:06.272

senators that we have here we

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.854
have. O'donnell assembly member

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:27.593
Todd Gloria. And is that lay

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.127
ahead- and addressing the

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.229
impacts of sea level rise

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.798
specifically as they relate to

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.766
the California economy so we

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.002
know there are lots of impacts

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:36.536
of sea level rise to many

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:46.479
different aspects so when I.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.113
Look at this and I think about

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.847
sea level rise my California

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.816
economy especially what it

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:50.416
means. In San Diego county but

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:54.120
throughout the state. The thing

00:05:54.187 --> 00:06:01.394
one is the M. it's gonna and

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:01.894
then the second as our

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:02.462
infrastructure and the third

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.796
which. I think is probably the

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.698
most timely when we look at now

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:06.299
that we have in del Mar. To do

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.000
with the at. And of course

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:15.541
those just. This focus areas

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:16.642
the all have- but I'd like to-

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.377
really reiterate we know the

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:22.949
sea level is rising. We have.

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:25.852
High tides and for. Ocean our

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:26.452
direct tax in California this

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.989
is. Putting now and we just saw

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.657
the reports that more and of

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.826
the rail corridor in del Mar

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.129
has fallen away we know this is

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.964
we're probably a little too

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.866
late for this discussion so

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:44.737
when we talk about our issues

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.906
and we think about them. Really

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:47.507
like us to look at how do we

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.742
move forward to action. It a

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:57.116
lot amber this. We have. Cut

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:59.719
pressing issues now throughout

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:00.253
our state that we need to

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:00.720
address we know. Will

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.021
governments have. I was in a

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.956
city council I was a co chair

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.758
of the sea level rise

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:06.325
subcommittee. Where we were

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.760
looking at our phone local

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.595
infrastructure in this area and

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.196
I know with stand out of the

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.331
showing preservation working

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:18.371
group we looked and take a take

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:21.607
an evaluation. Of the entire

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.509
coastline and sandy of county

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:24.076
on where is double structure

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:30.183
and. Areas that we can come

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:33.686
together and work together best

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:34.320
to make sure we have the best

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:34.921
outcome not only for today but

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:38.090
for tomorrow. And then we know

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:41.394
as a state where our priorities

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.729
can be and how do we better

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:47.166
coordinate these efforts into

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:47.733
real change. So before first

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.701
path to get to open up to the

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:49.268

today and really learn more

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:19.265
than I already know because I

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.868
don't. Know enough but why am I

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:25.905
here- specifically my district

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:26.505
have went back to see low rise

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.874
I represent seventy sunny

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.276
district. Long home stand

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.713
Catalina island so ground zero

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:36.015
right I'm a priest Adam economy

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:37.917
on to this hearing it's not

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:38.517
just about sea level rise but

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:42.521
the impact struck on me I

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:43.155
represent that both ports right

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:43.656
let one of largest port

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:44.323
complexes in the world. And sea

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.395
level rise has already

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:49.962
impacting them I represent a

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:50.529
lot of homes on the beach.

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:51.998
Already ma'am I was reading

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:55.601
some articles as I came down. I

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:58.170
to this hearing and I think the

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.872
two numbers resonated in. Mind

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:00.506
the most were ninety nine over

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:01.974
the last hundred years we've

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.044
lost nine inches of beach but

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:05.611
in the next four years will

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:09.382
lose nine feet of beach and

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:09.849
that's going to have a

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:10.483
significant impact on our last

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:11.984
stop on economy we need to be

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:14.220
prepared. For that fact and as

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.188
the local. In the last few

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.823
years we've seen climate change

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:18.457
impact our fire season well I

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:26.065
think we're going to face the

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:29.568
same dynamic. On the ocean

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:30.069
front and we need to be

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.004
prepared for that night you

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.773
know our coaching building

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.273
homes these places. Are

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.741
starting. Their bill. Homes in

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.743
the persons and then ultimately

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.311
our economy insurance rates

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:39.679

Encinitas we still have it and

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:39.899
we used to visit the beach here

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.101
always it was always slow so

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:43.702
much fun so recently after the

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:44.303
bluff collapse I toured the

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.606

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:48.174
shocked to see how much how

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.844
much is not left. In terms of-

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:52.445
what has happened over those

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:54.146
several decades so see rice's

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:57.750
real of for those who are not

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.718
comfortable with that I am very

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:00.352
comfortable with that because

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:01.987
I've witnessed it it affects my

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:04.023
district at thirty six Senate

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.791

cities all along the way

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:16.335
recently and send committee-

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.170
coastal trail that. We work so

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:20.272
long I was on the Orange County

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.941
Board of supervisors to ensure

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:22.508
that we have the funding for

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.843
that and it would go through

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.945
all the various sub permitting-

00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:28.247
we lost a part of that due to a

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.149
bluff collapse so now that

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.851
coastal trail and someone. Who

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:34.053
I thought was absolutely

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.855
wonderful- passed away and it

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.923
was projects so I would hope

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.491
some day we it's going to be

00:12:38.557 --> 00:12:40.226
named in her honor back

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:41.961
thinking about I felt a few

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.829
tears from heaven when that

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:44.363
happened we also have to

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.633
Capistrano. Beach we lost out

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.300
to with the high price and that

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:51.770
was a huge recreational area

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:52.438
for the people in south Orange

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.006
County cities of data points

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:56.041
and committee and surrounds so

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:57.877
it's real in it so- I think

00:12:57.943 --> 00:13:00.146
great that we're all here in a

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.047
bipartisan way with experts

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:05.718
that will help us I navigate

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:06.252
this very very difficult.

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:08.154
Problem and the solution that

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.122
we can all get behind it is

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:11.724
going to be a little bit of

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.226
every part of the question is

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.128
going to there's to be a little

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.997
bit a compromise that have

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.999
staff to happen but every

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:23.736
France that's what I'm here to

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.871
hold to hear from experts and

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:31.710
how we approach. Thank you

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:36.115
again and yes time to pull. Sec

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:39.752
so I'd like to our first now is

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:40.386
sealevel rise what is the state

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:42.021
up against an invite doctor

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:43.722
mark Meer filled director

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:44.256
center for climate change

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:44.757
impacts and adaptations

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:45.357
institute of oceanography at

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:46.258
UCSD we're so fortunate to have

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.862
such a premier organization- an

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:51.830
institution of research just in

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:53.832
our backyard- really helping us

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:55.768
to address some of these.

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.603
Issues so the floor is yours.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.339
Thank you for the invitation to

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.141
speak and I have a lot to cover

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:02.775
ten minutes all just jump right

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:06.011
to it. So what are we up

00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:08.013
against what we facing so this

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.115
plot. Is a projection of sea

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:12.051
level into the future for this

00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:14.019
is global but it is AB pregnant

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.788
for California as well. So

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.957
yellow line is where we've been

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:18.524
you can see will slow seal

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.927
riser last century. And then

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:22.528
those lines going off to the

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:23.829
right or projections are based

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:25.831
on different scenarios for. A

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.733
carbon use coverage a missions-

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.837
output and also some sciences

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:32.471
come to bear however how stable

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:35.874
the green. Of Greenland and

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:36.475
Antarctic ice sheets actually

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:40.246
are. All I want to emphasize

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:40.879
with this plot there's a lot of

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:41.847
detail here but what I want to

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:42.448
emphasize is first of all the-

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:48.220
magnitude of what the- okay the

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:50.122
man the man but that so we're

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:54.059
looking at anywhere from two to

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.961
eight feet of sea level rise by

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:56.562
the in the century. Depending

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.097
on the scenario. The other

00:14:58.163 --> 00:15:01.900
thing size the uncertainty

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:02.501
there's a quite a range here

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.869
that it's hard to make

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:04.470
projections it's hard to make

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:08.040
actionable- decisions based on

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.742
this sort of information you

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:12.278
need more detail- the other bit

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.912
of it is the timing so where we

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:14.580
are right now at the end of the

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:18.217
yellow curve. You can hear the

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:20.152
our future for soft the- office.

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:23.856
Senate yes. It means that we

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:26.225
have a choice true path with-

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.360
for most think of. How to do it

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.162
will rise. Is how to the

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.997
mission. And how to keep. Going

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:34.433
forward our job. Is to take is

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.037
going to be. I was a with which

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:43.008
we keep that curve down. What

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:46.679
the set up. What's it all for

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:54.119
you coast fact. Some maps. A

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:56.288
moderate celos attempt to see

00:15:56.355 --> 00:16:00.025
by some sort of center. On top

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:02.127
and storm thing significant but

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:13.372
he dot green it is flat after

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:14.006
of brown's owns a lot. Earlier

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:18.310
than flood. Zones and so where

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:21.947
you the server. Sure we can.

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:32.558
Some hot just Kobe San Diego of

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:33.192
inter county- Orange County new

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:35.794
Newport Newport beach. And that

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:37.730
flooding will bring with packs

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:41.800
us. Structure will be. Ports

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:42.434
and calm will have to deal with

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.236
the tires levels rational

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:44.770
Tiffany's talked about the

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:48.340
truck. And of course many of

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:50.409
the- other I'm supposed

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:57.082
highways are will be impacted.

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:57.683
And many facilities are among

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.985
the most which. Here's a that

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:03.822
hi fi. Not only the beaches

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:06.325
because there are to be a core

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:07.726
class this is work Adam young-

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:10.129
a survey that was done that was

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:10.729
just before one of these cliff

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:13.899
collapses. I just by

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:14.533
happenstance they happen to be

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.636
there and captured this- this

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.005
happens frequently I think Adam

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:20.639
show this last winter as being

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:25.911
a particularly. I'm. Or slides

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:26.478
were particularly prominent

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:27.079
throughout the winter season.

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:29.748
And we- heavy rains have

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:31.650
already started so that was the

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.251
fall let's see I think there's

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:35.821
a little dramatic pause here.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:47.566
Keeps going. This is a natural

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:53.739
of phenomena. It's. As a more

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:56.208
weight impact at the shore là.

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:59.244
Honest two minutes later. And

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:01.847
shot and of course here the

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.916
card on top of that so- chest

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:06.084
heading home how vulnerable

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.786
that hold out. Yes okay so what

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:08.420
can we do that's why we're here

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:09.054
so what sort of actions can we

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:09.988
take our first of all a some of

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:19.064
the information that we have to

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:19.631
deal with while it's very

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:21.567
useful for long. Term

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:22.201
projections it's not it's hard

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:22.768
to make. A definitive plan.

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:28.173
Need more. In about. It a base

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:28.740
for that act quantifies the

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:32.010
impacts flooding on the Cup

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:32.578
what's the second can pass

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:36.014
along a rose to view what's-

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.183
ships and pose for since

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.587
shoreline that based on exit

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:43.789
it's hard to kind of scared

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:46.425
from to predict what happened.

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:50.062
Though not. Database out

00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:52.064
percent I these infants are

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.266
happy day not likely to change

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:54.766
in the future. Also the

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:55.868
economic impact CNN but our

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:59.771
making some great strides in

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:00.372
imperial beach with a search

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:01.173
the dance team this was on a

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.011
forecast it was Mayes last last

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:07.479
winter and part of.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.046
Understanding flooding is

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:13.485
understand. Pleasant so were

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:14.052
dedicate helping them get a

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.922
better understanding floods.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.657
Answer and so they can do so

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:19.258
planet buzz how the world into

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:23.762
still Lara. Is in a couple of a

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:28.567
cat. Came that prop. Hey so. As

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:29.067
I said there's a lot of

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:29.701
uncertainty going forward click

00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:32.371
those curves are- quite

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:34.740
different difference so you

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:35.240
have to do is buy step

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:38.544
proactive approach to-

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.312
adaptation so it's called

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:44.783
triggered an adept pathways. So

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.417
this is all some strategies to

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:46.652
try take some pretty open the

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:48.954
shore in their- search for. You

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:54.726
my are out of the- and I. The

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:59.131
left side. Water level rises

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:00.332
far enough for the be. Advice

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.634
all you have to some of us

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.771
structure or some sort harder

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:06.338
topic along shoreline that's

00:20:06.405 --> 00:20:08.340
passed by a. I and eight and

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:12.878
that'll serve. Dozens and at

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.546
some point they have to be some

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:19.184
actual- up open what. I'm on

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:22.454
the impacts understand and the

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:23.055
when you make these ages what

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:29.127
is trigger. Prompt you from

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:29.728
current that's where the path

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:30.996
and someone. Think that have to

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.966
be back on scientific

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:34.533
information in these are all

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.335
decisions but again with that

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:40.639
and Ste information about flood

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:41.273
out has database of the flood

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.342
and cal yeah we'll be more

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:43.909
informed decisions about how

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:48.413
to. Approach this problem. The

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.216
other thing I should know it is

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:51.817
not. I think California should

00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:56.421
look the way in a. In

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:57.022
developing our our innovative

00:20:57.089 --> 00:21:01.026
strapped for sure. So what is

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:01.660
person strategy for our show as

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:06.832
many of the- guidance is a come

00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:07.466
out are for sure lines on the

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:10.769
east coast. As we want to think

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:11.370
about California's house lines

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:12.671
are settlement our way climate

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.373
is the best management strategy

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:14.973
how often should happen what's

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.044
the grains. I'm sure we built.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.446
Up if the blood was the living

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:22.047
shoreline it was put in a part

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:26.685
of. Task I really. Need to

00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:27.319
understand the process and call

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.655
that. Affect California the

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:34.960
test for coastal protection.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:38.296
Our research we don't I am the

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:40.432
team after that's for sure but

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:42.401
we do need to have such as a

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:42.968
better understanding of how

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:47.406

visit district. It has been a

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:36.721
lot of time. North coast one of

00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:38.957
which is the historic business.

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:39.424
That's also one of our

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.727
principal transportation. I'm

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:45.230
one good to talk about

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:47.232
intersection of steel right and

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:47.766
Oakley because of the two

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:48.299
topics that I'm passionate

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:54.339
about. So up. Is there a local

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:55.740
sobre universe all mom pop

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:59.244
businesses just this past may

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.011
I'm as you can see an event

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:03.948
poster we are so proud of our-

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:06.151
into the code we us so much of

a tentative our small business

00:28:08.086 --> 00:28:10.021
up into the fact that were

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:13.525
beach adjacent we are visitor

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:14.125
search commercial not serves

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:19.831
both. Locals and- as far as far

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:26.471
as imperial valley imperial. Me

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:27.005
out zona and you see that

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:29.107
during the summer. So beach

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:30.241
people come here for. A for our

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:32.977
businesses. I'm some one is

00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:35.914
that it was created to be a-

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.849
just. To conveyance that's all

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:41.086
it was designed to do getting

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:41.619
people from LA to town San

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:45.924
Diego or to. For the years

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.460
we've seen that the

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:49.060
functionality of this road has

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:54.332
changed as a community. Charlie.

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:57.936
Brown's was born I think it's

00:28:58.002 --> 00:28:58.570
always been not the corner here

00:28:58.636 --> 00:28:59.204
of ash hi everyone I want and

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.606
that was all- auto serving a

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:02.273
card it ship and recently they

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.644
respond to the changing culture

00:29:06.711 --> 00:29:07.245
and they re open and read. It

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:09.948
as Charlie's electric by. Good

00:29:10.014 --> 00:29:10.448
example in a ship in our

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:20.358
economy. That beautiful store

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:20.859
that was struck by local

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:21.493
artists are him out and you can

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:28.099
see. Lights were. Oct Bob. Food

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.667
so highly one one really is our

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:30.235
town square it's a these are

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:31.536
people come together it has to

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:34.539
about- in and of itself to

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:36.574
just. From point a to point B.

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:39.644
our our our like. Both our

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:42.947
economy and to coastal act yes

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:44.516
in taxes start talking about

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:46.184
all rights because not only is

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:46.718
it transportation but also

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:52.157
these other two. Parts of what

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:52.790
it what the Stevenson it assist

00:29:52.857 --> 00:29:56.761
is made up. So what we're not

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:59.063
lose that in thirty three sixty

00:29:59.130 --> 00:29:59.564
six per cent of beaches

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:03.001
southern California this is. So

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:05.904
hard right around I don't even

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.872
think that I fully done it yet

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:14.012
and most. Armored. Zero beaches

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:14.546
which is Annie this is our

00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:15.914
majority of B. we really only

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.882
have two beaches left that you

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:18.449
can go during even a medium

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:20.084
tied which- one is now in

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:20.585
Cardiff and other one is

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:24.589
moonlight beach. And so here

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:25.190
to- images to illustrate the

00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:26.457
child that we're up against.

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:30.562
The left you'll see a photo

00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:31.162
from the twenty eighteen stone

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:34.232
steps toward on test is. A much

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:36.201
loved community event. Gives

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:37.769
birth to our small businesses.

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:40.038
Because people come for this

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:41.873
event people have a living area

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.507
for a long time they- they come

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:44.676
back to locate enjoy it. But as

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.978
you can see there was no beach

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.680
and so. They kind of left

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:49.681
everybody thinking I can still

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:51.883
surf but there's just this

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.185
specter. Vent that's missed. So

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:56.154
what you see over the years is

00:30:56.221 --> 00:30:57.655
fewer and fewer days that we

00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:58.256
can actually enjoy our beaches

00:30:58.323 --> 00:30:58.856
and the other effects of that

00:30:58.923 --> 00:30:59.891
is that. Our recreational

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.559
opportunities are limited our

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:02.093
exercise opportunities are

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.928
limited and this is a really

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:05.964
threaten ecosystem in southern

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.732
California. That we're seeing

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:09.834
get smaller and smaller by the

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:11.736
day. This year the San papers

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:12.437
are out there so take a look if

00:31:12.503 --> 00:31:14.038
you have a chance to get down

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:16.241
there- and on the right that's

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:17.742
a an example of a success so

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:19.677
this is the living shoreline

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:23.181
project- I found out recently

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:23.715
that Larry Giles who's our

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:30.221
marines. Safety captain. He is

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:30.722
a fourth generation and

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:36.594
intonation. It's a need. And

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:38.830
that he he remembered when this

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:39.464
was- do not attack and so this

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.498
was sort of impetus of. How can

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:42.000
we engineer re engineer dunes

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:42.533
that have multi benefits

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.801
including infrastructure

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:44.335
protection for this really

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:46.504
practice. Connection between.

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:48.206
It's a need us in our-

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:48.740
subsidies. Infrastructure

00:31:48.806 --> 00:31:50.141
protection- replacement of

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.143
historic ecosystem so it's

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.013
amazing I think we had our

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:55.647
first snow you clover- make a

00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:58.116
nest there last year it didn't.

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.051
Last but the hope is that they

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:00.685
will learn that this is a place

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:03.755
where they can find rest. And

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:06.157
we even added. A improve our

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:11.996
coastal access with Gen walkway.

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:13.164
Highway and right to do even

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:15.933
though you're not a beach up

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.902
there still will to interact

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:18.436
with the ocean and able to

00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:21.973
enjoy our coastal. And we added

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.875
four acres of this project so

00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:25.843
that those and it's come a new

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.912
destination and a lot of ways-

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:28.513
so these are the images from

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:36.187
last Tuesday. It was six point

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:38.523
six tied we had lots of service

00:32:38.589 --> 00:32:41.693
to. See start and to. Or if

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:44.095
roof and these photos were

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:46.764
taken caption there Giles- and

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:47.365
the middle one was taken of

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:51.169
Leucadia beat its grand view

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:51.803
and in Leucadia. No beaches the

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:54.872
only people there a go to the

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:55.473
beach that day were really if

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.476
Sir. To keep. These what steps

00:32:58.543 --> 00:32:59.077
and jump off and get into the

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:03.047
ocean but beach access. I'm

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:03.614
this was taken on thinks. Is

00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:08.152
also located. Side part of this

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:10.121
is just I'm size part that. We

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:12.256
have a local music will there

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:14.125
we host of events that the- AB

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:17.028
small businesses come together.

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:17.562
So it's all because of the

00:33:17.628 --> 00:33:21.966
dedicated. That would be able

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:26.037
to turn this a park back into

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:27.438
apart from big back into a park

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:31.676
for surf top which is almost as.

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:32.243
If that had been etched. And

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.710
you'll see the in the

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:36.114
background you. A manual pumps

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.118
are still out there even. We

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:42.453
didn't get off the event it's

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.255
still challenge for us. I'm so

00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:44.889
coastal region comes in a whole

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:45.490
bunch of different varieties

00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:46.124
which means that we have to

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.691
react we have to message we

00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:50.528
have to respond in. Many

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:52.497
different ways so you see that

00:33:52.563 --> 00:33:53.030
photo the far left was a

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:55.867
discreet episode think happened

00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:58.436
in just a moment. And as a mark

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:01.139
Gen there's vegetation that

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:02.106
have ice plant I can't any

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:04.041
other chronic inclusion but-

00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:06.177
looks like it could have been

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:10.681
part of that feel in the middle

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:14.986
this is a case in US ongoing

00:34:15.052 --> 00:34:17.722
stumping. Up doesn't. It. But

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.624
he really even talk to missus

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.592
isn't. That much of note and on

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.128
the right had a catastrophic

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:26.063
failure summers I think we all

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.232
still field believe me a lot

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:28.800
the lives of. Three shifts

00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:35.873
community map. Dot thank.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.341
Coastal phone- program in

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:41.746
ministry and dot person is like.

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:42.313
To you a couple of projects

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.749
that works about happening

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:45.249
right now in the city of

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:52.790
Encinitas. You have two minutes.

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:54.659
Okay I'll run through this I'm

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:56.160
Jamie to really come the some

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:56.761
program administrator for the

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:58.463
city best a which is funded and

00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:01.632
by at a transient occupancy tax

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.801
that was established in

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:04.435
nineteen ninety eight through a

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.070
local proposition the program

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:08.573
and I are dedicated solely to

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.141
building coastal resilience and

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:11.943
facilitating beach restoration

00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:12.543
projects through a phased out

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:16.214
of. Reach so what these-

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.915
efforts is the at St

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:21.018
compatibility which is to use

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:22.687
program or stoop we maintain

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:25.456
these per. Their federal and

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:28.693
state regulators permits which

00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:29.260
help streamline the process

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:32.363
dean. And depositing high

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.897
quality compatible and low

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.532
volume amounts of San. You are

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:36.434
road beaches under the skew

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:37.869
program Sanders obtained

00:35:37.935 --> 00:35:39.704
through opportunistic sources

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.839
which may include the goon in

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:42.473
the aging is my construction

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.908
basin maintenance or habitat

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.810
restoration projects.

00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:46.310
Additionally the coastal

00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:48.646
management program advocates

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.214
and coordinates with the army

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:52.350
corps of engineers and elected

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:53.851
state officials in pursuit a

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.820
fifty year and mostly federally

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:56.420
funded large beach nourishment

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.155
project. The coastal storm

00:35:58.222 --> 00:35:59.957
damage reduction project as

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:03.761
it's called at plans to place

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:04.328
three hundred forty thousand

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:09.100
cubic yards of sand initially

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:09.600
and. Two hundred twenty

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:14.372
thousand cubic yards every five

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:20.278
years after that. For only be.

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:20.845
The product hills taking San

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:24.715
from for press. And place it in

00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:25.316
a wide berm at the very bluff

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:29.654
through nine nourishment. I

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.187
from these types of nurse

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:30.755
projects ongoing scientific

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.723
studies form beach and bluff

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.791
management teams and help us

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:34.392
plan the dot for long term sea

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:38.162
level rise. Beats with and by

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:38.796
our bi annually state at least

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.398
across the whole city. And said

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:44.502
he's been perfect part of.

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:45.703
Highway one by both CLA and use

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.639
S. T. bluff management studies

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.675
are also currently underway we

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:51.342
are investigating the causes of

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:52.677
bluff failures as as they

00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:54.278
relate to vegetation. The city

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:56.280
is C. to devise a bluff

00:36:56.347 --> 00:37:01.052
vegetation management I'd with

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:01.586
the goal of providing. In

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:04.755
seizing. Guidance to private

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:05.323
residence and state parks on

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:08.492
how best to manage. Create less

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:12.597
vulnerable hazardous mission.

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:14.231
The city consistent studies

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:14.832
near Sharif's to ensure that

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.568
all out it's been cleaned

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:19.103
efforts are not negatively

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.206
affecting our offshore biota.

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:22.840
These studies specifically will

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:24.342
inform long term adaptation

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:26.043
solutions such as the creation

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:26.677
of artists to reefs. That could

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:29.680
facilitate San retention. Okay

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:33.985
I'm gonna get through it.

00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:36.487
Thirty seconds oh my goodness

00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:37.088
okay I'm gonna skip this one

00:37:37.154 --> 00:37:39.790
but our highway has continued

00:37:39.857 --> 00:37:40.424
to adopt as we have to become a

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:44.061
gathering. For people of. All

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:46.163
abilities all ages together

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.831
they're out of carbon- emitting

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:48.332
vehicles of X. on foot

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:50.368
strollers wheelchairs. That's

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:51.002
what our highways working often

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:52.570
hear some of our a new users we

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:53.104
didn't see a lot of those

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:58.409
before. This I could have on

00:37:58.476 --> 00:37:59.043
one street scape and using Jack

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.678
that- trees question been

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:01.212
chopper rain water provide

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:04.415
access. Senate bill road to the

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:06.884
beach and then lastly how are

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:09.887
later can assist us. So we need

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:11.789
some Caltrans coordination with.

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:14.425
Right prior to our critical

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:16.260
infrastructure assets of the

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:19.063
family hold a goon is it ranks

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.232
highly- for their funding and

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:23.968
it should be because it's very

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:24.468
vulnerable we need help

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:25.236
eliminate access or beach the

00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:27.038
PC no longer wants a permit

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:30.041
crossings but are the cheapest

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:30.608
sixteen usually forts we're

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:32.209
gonna need some help- under

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:35.112
crosses them and also we need

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:35.713
more collaboration between our

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.582
non regulatory agencies to help

00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.785
our cities. And running before

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:46.157
having to act can't talk. I el

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:46.691
amendment. And then lastly

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:47.258
settlement and addresses you

00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:47.825
know we find out that.

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:48.459
Sentiment trapped in our local

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:49.860
watersheds how do we get it

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:50.461
where it needs to be to the

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:51.829
beaches and not have to. Eat so

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:52.296
much for with private

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:54.065
developers to do that- so if

00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:56.767
anybody wants to write a letter

00:38:56.834 --> 00:39:00.104
to. The army corps that's a

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:00.705
contact info and that would be

00:39:00.771 --> 00:39:05.009
helpful thank you. I love the

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:05.876
action orientation of the last

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:09.947
five. Yes thank you

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:13.918
councilmember cut. Almost like

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:18.255
thirds I wanna. Here I want to

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:22.493
thank assembly member about for

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.094
having us I think one of our

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.295
biggest challenges going

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:27.832
forward is to have this

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:28.432
collaboration any successful

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:30.701
solution was gonna bald us is I

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:34.772
can- and so any a mitigation

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.941
efforts we don't impact our

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:40.811
neighbors native. Negatively

00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:42.146
gathered tele. I'm gonna steer

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:47.651
away from some macros just

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:48.252
focus on our unique challenge

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:50.621
Oceanside. And having an in for

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.790
us this a speculative issue.

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:54.725
Now and we need to take action

00:39:54.792 --> 00:40:01.665
immediate I don't. Our to along

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:02.299
motions aye and what a what so

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:05.202
have the CEO of visit oceans

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:06.437
and. And as you brought up

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:09.974
earlier there are economic on.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.309
Coastal provision could. Once

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:14.211
is our city so this first

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:16.280
picture it gives you a really

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:18.549
good over view she died and-

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:19.183
for those you were not aware we

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.853
are the third biggest city in

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.158
the county by population about

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:27.792
a hundred seven five was in the

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:32.730
of three to four miles. Three

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:36.300
miles across the street from.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:36.867
Ten in our harbor as you can

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:42.506
see to. Carlsbad to this so it

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:50.681
but I cannot. West. We are a

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:54.852
public utilities and we have a

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:55.452
lot of our drivers are driven

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:58.556
by our beaches so we have. An

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.191
estimate we provide our beat

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:00.724
writer she provides about

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:03.894
hundred job. Room three hundred

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:04.862
fifty one million annual

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.030
visitors spending and twenty

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.765
two and state and local taxes

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:11.068
and a lot SB Joran and we have

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:11.735
a Venn super approach is it's a

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:13.704
fantastic event for us and-

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.940
I've taken my daughter there

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:16.440
several years and just

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:18.242
incredible for our- region

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.678
answer. That have a soccer term

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:22.746
at the beach so it is our

00:41:22.813 --> 00:41:24.281
beaches are integral part our

00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:27.818
state and mark successfully

00:41:27.885 --> 00:41:35.359
hinges on. Other of our beaches.

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.026
So going through start for

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:38.495
north south we harbor it's your

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:39.129
unique to our being that starts

00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:42.032
a camp Gen. Out of the Santa

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.968
Margarita river more work to.

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:46.303
But what finished as it does is

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.172
it stops function Santa support

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.007
from north south so with that

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:52.309
and mark the river. So my group

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:56.413
eight light tan post but at.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.082
The pretty pictures most back.

00:41:58.148 --> 00:42:00.718
Beaches are Beach until ten and

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:04.154
they want to be. When you

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:04.755
decide you can still get learn

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:10.327
more. So our check is open year.

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:10.928
The hopper dreads that's army

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:12.363
corps of engineers broad and

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:12.997
generally happens every spring

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:15.165
and you can see from the ocean

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:18.502
between the outer breakwater

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:19.103
their break water fills up a

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:20.004
sand from the law sure San

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:24.642
transport every spring and has.

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:25.209
Rights to get to the proper

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.110
depths. Product that is sand

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:30.014
that will. Which is but very

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.815
many it doesn't actually. Sir

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:34.285
be as much as we need so and

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:34.752
that's one of our main

00:42:34.818 --> 00:42:36.287
challenges is you know how do

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:36.887
we get some at San from north

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:38.122
of the harbour to south no

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:39.857
water harbor does have- causes

00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:42.760
its fair share of sand issues

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:44.662
it's also a great economic

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:47.097
driver as well so. It not only

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:47.798
does have the del Mar both

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.134
basin for K. Senate's although

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:50.668
almost a thou slip order a

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:53.938
harbor. Also regional asset

00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:56.473
that is a fantastic place

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.108
whether you sail or even take

00:42:58.175 --> 00:43:02.146
well watching it it's a great

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:02.746
opportunity we just need to.

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:04.782
Learn how to work with it and

00:43:04.848 --> 00:43:05.382
get the sand around that I

00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:05.883
that's been our- biggest

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:15.125
challenge. The north the south

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:15.659
we also miss our beach and

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:29.506
while. Maybe you to have as a

00:43:29.573 --> 00:43:30.074
long wooden pier Wescott in

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.643
this kind of Morrell. S. a man

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.778
structures and for so as you go

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:39.950
of the south from the pier.

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:40.551
Your week we have a unique to

00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:41.085
on our coast were. About a

00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:44.088
hundred- a much for coastal

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:44.722
land was subdivided in plan for

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:46.490
resident no so we have streets

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.359
and houses up right on the

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:48.993
beach there protected by these

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:52.329
rock revetments. We don't have

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:54.365
a healthy each the way to go

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.033
into a commitments at the state

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.735
agency we're dealing with now.

00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.803
Our best laid out as that.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.705
Through on a healthy beach also

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:02.339
impacting those revetments at

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:04.041
home so this is a challenge

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:06.243
we've had for awhile but now

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.245
it's becoming extreme as you

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:08.846
can see in this picture. Close

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.614
that's our strand we club road

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:13.784
regularly during high tides and

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:16.587
when we have- more swelled the

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:18.756
normal. It's a challenge we're

00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:20.324
already seeing damage to houses.

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.126
And those are we have about

00:44:22.192 --> 00:44:24.061
five homes that we roughly a

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:26.363
dinner a dinner coastal hazards

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.997
vulnerability assessment. Five

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:27.598
hundred million dollar and

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:30.567
property value in million

00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:31.668
dollars every year. And

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:35.239
residential property tax so

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:35.839
it's a it's a big on ports of

00:44:35.906 --> 00:44:40.010
our city. Economic. Mmhm

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:40.577
success is down there it's

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:43.313
gonna be I was going forward to

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:43.947
address some of the houses that

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.916
are located there. I want to

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:48.585
go. On to conclude that's our

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:50.521
southern border which the it's

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:54.024
on these houses and very.

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:56.060
Portable how's but since I

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:58.162
found it three side by what so

00:44:58.228 --> 00:45:00.130
they're gonna impact and his

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:03.767
rise or any stand. Which in the

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:04.401
end we are you check Gen oceans

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:07.371
I think. Really impacted are

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:13.010
the- I think I'm going back

00:45:13.077 --> 00:45:13.577
this really illustrates this

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:15.679
picture is a great. Example of

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:18.615
shoes you see the sand stopping

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:21.051
north of the harbor and we

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:25.355
install it so. I don't know how

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:28.392
the left wing. This is this. Is

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:31.361
not in your twenty year this is

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:32.796
it she we're dealing with now

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:38.268
and it's could come in. We

00:45:38.335 --> 00:45:40.137
address it and so we focused

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:40.671
the next fifteen to twenty

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:42.406
years you know that way we

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:42.973
don't the spec it. Out about

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.441
two feet of sea level Rafe. Yes

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:49.146
it's almost irrelevant we have

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:49.613
an issue to deal with

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.147
immediately and it's to be

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:54.585
Chao. We've. It numerous

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:56.019
letters army corps of engineers

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:57.654
asking for fees of study and

00:45:57.721 --> 00:46:00.457
that's what on what can we do

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.024
with our endorsement. Impact

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:06.330
does the harbor have. Mission

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:06.930
promised in twenty twenty- get

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.699
put on the priorities so I can

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:09.233
tell you the good news the

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.635
sounds of the council

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.137
unanimously passed a step for

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:16.340
us go ahead and route in the

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:19.676
nourishment. Là via. She's we

00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:22.646
have all our city were all work

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:23.247
in the right direction to get

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:25.582
those beaches help again but

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:26.216
it's going to be a challenge so

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:26.817
they also have our- principle

00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:29.186
planner from the city rest

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:29.820
Cunningham who is kind lead the

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:34.758
move. City to. This fight what

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:35.325
the effects will be so again

00:46:35.392 --> 00:46:38.028
for having us. Thank you. The

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:39.897
thank you very much for that I

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:42.399
appreciate you doing. Man it

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:45.035
really helps us understand the

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:48.405
similarities between the cities

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:48.972
and the difference. And now

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:50.474
mayor to Tina. Great I think I

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:54.278
have a present and I'm imperial

00:46:54.344 --> 00:46:54.811
beach the stopping of the

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:56.280
county. Bob blue collar town

00:46:56.346 --> 00:46:56.914
twenty thousand people third of

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.714
our kids live in poverty 25%

00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:00.217
poverty rate. So really the

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:00.851
frame here is gonna be really

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.452
about equity. And really not

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.754
just about economic development

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.354
but about the development we

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:08.292
don't have. And the fact that

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:08.892
when we have flooded floods

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:12.629
cleaned or be on our streets

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:13.330
that means that's money were

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:16.333
taken away. From life are

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.169
problems and try to get a part.

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:22.706
Because we don't. We don't have.

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:23.340
Recently grocery store so we're

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:23.974
not there were some percent of.

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:26.777
Our. Living in Iraq hide your

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:28.745
pride making ends. Not just

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:34.051
about it in in poppy ride like

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:36.053
inch with trailer parks are

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:38.222
still tight you know it you you

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:40.390
see I hope. That's not the sort

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:43.060
of issue there were dressing on

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:45.429
a drug issue same and my pop he

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:48.432
is. Making sure that we can we

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:52.703
can carry out of for that are

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:53.337
still live in poverty and have

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:53.971
a great quality of life to send

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:56.840

00:47:56.907 --> 00:48:04.414
side or. Throughout southern

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:05.048
California how we're surrounded

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:07.951
on three sides. To start. Any

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:08.552
to wallow if you know straight

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:10.721
obviously. Rising that's going

00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:18.395
to be end up. In my area there

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:22.599
is kids I'm. Might you know I

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.334
grew up in ivy my focus right

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:26.470
now isn't to still buys it make

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.372
sure to my can walk street not

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:29.006
by a car that's the issue right

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:31.008
like paving always were

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.743
crosswalks I am interested to

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:34.177
your leads back of unpaved

00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:35.545
alleys right people were

00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:36.113
because I can get to their

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:39.249
home. Was ending and thanks

trader Joe's real whole foods.

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:50.460
Grocery outlet that's what

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.162
works for our community the-

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:54.097
well for us right. And in

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:54.731
addition to the toxic waste in

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.700
storage at the club southern be

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.135
trait eight months right so we

00:48:58.201 --> 00:49:00.570
are dealing all the new things

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.239
try to fight for community. In

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:06.443
dealing boxing is to bridge. As

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.711
our southern beach last year's

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.447
on is. Close right now so what

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:13.884
are your servers were. Big

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:14.484
waves the last week especially

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:18.522
the bay. Guys run the water.

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:19.056
Disclosed pollutant charts

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:25.896
rough level this is a state.

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:26.897
Feel state I surely this

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:27.531
because this is a reality on on

00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:32.002
where the- I think is right.

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.602
It's gonna be shows dealers a

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:35.005
video which of you can press up

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:38.575
now yeah see. Thanks mark the

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:48.919
guys have been help. The

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:52.656
transcripts be John Gould has

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:55.992
lived in vero beach again for a

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:56.493
little over a year. He's

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:05.969
already gotten loose. It was my.

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:06.603
Sixteen high tide. They haven't

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:08.672
once or twice sorry. No that

00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:15.879
was last year. Worse. I script

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:16.446
predicted that the light the

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:20.817
minute thank you mark. We were

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:21.418
we can is four days in advance

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.987
what really really hot on. So

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:24.588
anyway we actually carried out

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:27.591
on talking to twenty fifteen op

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:28.191
I think the California coast

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:30.494
commission California coast

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.562
Conservancy and are sending a

00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:33.130
foundation I see the rise in

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:38.435
by. This and- but. The

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:40.871
supervisor base structure on so.

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:46.877
We found that on again impacts.

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:47.477
On throughout our community it

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:52.015
a total a lot Buck. A lot of

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:56.286
cost of ink on route the city

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:58.989
not just the west side of this

00:50:59.055 --> 00:50:59.589
right by the ocean but on our

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:00.223
bay front. And identifying the

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:01.992
few flooding right this is

00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:04.761
actually were built on the salt

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:05.262
flat rock Michael upland

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:08.198
habitat from. It back the day

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:08.799
was flooded right looks like

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:10.801
supposed to be I'm so what we

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:13.036
find about 40% of all roads

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:13.603
will be about. A Silverlight

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.473
rise 2110030% a part in

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:22.312
buildings arm and in. South.

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.147
Pretty so often and here I

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:26.216
think the forty three

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:27.651
different. Things we can do all

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.820
I took a hundred saw. Dr if we

00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:31.922
only focused on manage retreat

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:32.522
and get mad the people don't

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:34.157
want to lose our homes and were

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:34.724
surprised that we see what

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:35.792
happened del Mar and ID. Then

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:37.761
we're going to spend the next

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:40.230
hundred years being at war with

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:40.764
the wealthy speak on the

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:41.231
planet. I'm not doing

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.800
allocation. I think what you're

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:44.401
seeing at the statewide level

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:46.102
and on and on the global level

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:47.604
as it was at the meditation

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:48.238
meeting in now to sign in in in

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:50.307
our in in April. Or may we have

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:52.142
people from all over the world

00:51:52.209 --> 00:51:52.776
actually talking meditation is

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.444
they realize that if we're just

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:56.213
gonna get in a box about manage

00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:57.781
retreat. With private property

00:51:57.848 --> 00:51:59.916
owners we're not to preserve

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:00.517
our coast we've got to figure

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:01.618
out we've got to be a lot

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.620
smarter about how to do this.

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:04.254
And we got to broaden the scope

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:06.523
of what we do. Not talk about

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:10.026
the address but I'm we know we

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:11.862
know who paid for we know who

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:12.429
process obviously the client

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:14.498
the- fossil fuel industry so.

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:16.967
We were the first city world to

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.168
sue the fossil fuel industry

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:22.372
for causing surprise. It was.

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:26.676
My Richmond Santa Cruz. Carries

00:52:26.743 --> 00:52:29.846
a separate tailing brand. All

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:30.413
older now by state of Rhode

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:36.319
Island to more. As the fact is

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:36.887
I think this is a big thing

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:40.657
legislators. We have zero money

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:41.258
to deal with this zero money

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:42.225
either want to pay my straight

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:43.827
to make sure that my kids have

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.929
a great quality of life kids

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.265
who live in poverty. Or I can

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:48.865
find the money from somewhere

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:51.067
and reality is we're gonna

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:51.701
figure this out for California

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.937
so on I wanna think scripts for

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.273
this our coastal monitoring

00:52:56.339 --> 00:53:00.043
forecasting flooding model it's

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.045
brilliant it's genius. Loves

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:04.214
talk to scripted wrote

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:05.916
scientists on our beaches with

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:16.059
low they call. Taking a class.

00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:16.660
And use it top world prop that

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:27.971
helps. Run flow. If your local

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:28.605
calls plan. Which is in about

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:29.839
as a regulatory box about

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:32.309
something that happened over

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:34.311
the next hundred years. All

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:34.911
right who has to deal with the

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:37.147
next hundred years right. If we

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:39.015
think it's been hot it is a

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:42.485
reason it's hard because we're

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:43.053
not we're not process been

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:45.121
built. To deal with for years

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:47.857
right we can over the next ten

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:49.659
minutes in the next ten years

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.361
but not on for years it's

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:56.366
complex stuff. Research figure.

00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:57.000
Out park or because the plan to

00:53:57.067 --> 00:54:00.403
deal with. Watashi. Destructive

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:04.140
right public the structure.

00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:06.576
Republican for sure public

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.311
pressure that's our obligation

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:08.878
to address the construction

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:13.049
we're gonna. All natural

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:15.885
climate solutions restoration

00:54:15.952 --> 00:54:18.521
right restoration restoration

00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:22.626
restaurant. On the beach us

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:26.596
let's take the next better

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:31.601
could not test. On to be.

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:34.537
Should with natural ecosystems

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:36.373
we are so behind we've got to

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:39.042
be ahead of the curve and I've

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.609
talked to leaders Sacramento

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:44.347
the resource. God way Crofoot.

00:54:44.414 --> 00:54:46.549
This we've got to be better on

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:47.150
this and- figure out how to

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:49.919
given agencies like the poor

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:50.520
the airport authority or send

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:53.890
act in Senate to question more

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:56.059
carbon. The enough for one the

00:54:56.126 --> 00:55:00.597
solutions. And then maybe even

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:01.164
do offsets for it right and

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:06.403
then finally. Eight there's a

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:07.037
kid from the valley kids are to

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:12.809
make sure. This weather. Is

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:18.248
Sir. Where is it. When the

00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:20.583
water could not be that's what

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:32.595
it is right right. I say manage.

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:35.732
What's happening or even I be

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:38.668
is to be expected if you come

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:39.235
up planned the says. It it's

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:39.836
will tell you that you might

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.705
have to move out your houses in

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:44.107
three years of course people

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:46.242
get upset we should expect. We

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:48.078
have to be smarter about how we

00:55:48.144 --> 00:55:50.613
do this I saw presentation by

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.581
mark called is that the ocean

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:54.517
protection council I think

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:55.051
folks in Sacramento we're

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:56.086
talking climate bond are really

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:57.954
thinking strategically about

00:55:58.021 --> 00:55:58.488
this and saying if we get

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:02.392
sucked in. To adults with

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.026
private you know the wealthiest

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:06.429
people on the planet. We're

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:07.797
not. Storm protect the entire

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.833
California coastline blocking.

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:14.404
For well as assembly hold a gun

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:15.038
and- we think stand for billing

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:16.973
project assembly hall. Hello

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:17.540
talk about it. But that's we

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:21.010
have to focus on these. Big

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:21.611
picture. Public infrastructure

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:24.280
protecting our beaches right.

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:24.748
On restore our natural

00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:27.684
wetlands. And doing those

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:33.056
things robin just. Spending 99%

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:36.726
of our time doc. But private

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:45.401
property. Just cried since this

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:48.805

to Dana thank you so much for

00:56:58.314 --> 00:56:58.748
really at addressing the

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:01.751
elephant that I think is in the

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:04.387
room. How do you really talk

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:05.021
matter that Tatian when there's

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.456
conflict involved. In the

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.892
interest of time running about

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:09.526
five minutes behind we're gonna

00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:11.628
move straight to the next panel

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:12.929
of the so I hope for. Our panel

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:16.366
will- of to limit centers. Will

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:21.437
remove. No solutions to see

00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:22.071
level right we have Jacob Gould

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:24.440
single senior legal counsel for

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:26.676
in north county transit

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:27.977
district. Calling plans for the

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:30.046

are all the agencies that are

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:51.601
going to be presenting so we

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:52.168

And I can tell you that. If you

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:27.904
think about it. Let's say god

forbid operations stop. We

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:35.845
could read out passengers what

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:40.316
to do with freight 10% of old

00:58:40.383 --> 00:58:44.153

said we need the state to help

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.826
and we get to a bond be money.

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:52.929
To build goods moment the first

god for the civilization that I

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:12.815
would engineers that either way

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:13.383
what happened. To the to go

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:17.887
with the- this Senate that I

can get this from the not say

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.958
yes to six million dollars to

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:22.525
design the next phase that's

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:23.927
the belies ation. We need

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:25.695
eighty nine million dollars. To

00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:27.764
quote design construct.

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:30.266
Civilization five five six

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:32.468
that's immediate that's a

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:33.136
safety issue. We should not the

00:59:33.202 --> 00:59:37.573
bill. We should figure out what

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.207
get the money we should do it.

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:43.112
Long. And I appreciate Medina

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:46.382
said look then we have to. Face

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:46.983
up to the fact that political

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.618
solution is not get. It's not

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:52.322
cheap. It's gonna và moving

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:54.791
the fax Ellen is gonna involved

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:58.428
and a lot of if structure work

00:59:58.494 --> 00:59:59.028
that were not used to and it's

00:59:59.095 --> 00:59:59.629
gonna cost in the billions. Of

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:04.467
the millions. And I promise you

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.402
I met to you that in eighteen

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:07.537
months. You will see the

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:09.672
solutions in the table on I

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:11.774
told you a some of that. Going

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:12.408
to be any discussion partisan

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.310
discussion for leaders to

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:14.944
difficult Sir gonna here today

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:17.914
from Colleen about specific

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:18.481
things as he level rise and

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:19.849
other things we were doing the

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.485
five big moves. I think we're

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:25.154
leading the country acted in

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.390
how we think about the future

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:31.961
in a press to the class

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:32.562
provisional sustainability so

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:33.129
with that thought then. The

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:33.730
final. Thank you. Members of

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:38.368
the- and I'm thank you Hassan

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:38.935
for the introduction and I

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:42.505
think this- actually the way we

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:43.139
are thinking about this fits in

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:47.543
really well for what am heard

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:50.079
from I'm doctor Merrifield

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.881
about it the key. Mitch

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:52.515
sealevel rise as a result of

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.884
that and so one of the things

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:57.920
that we're working on it see an

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:58.488
bag is putting a bold new

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:02.091
transfer. Vision to really

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:04.761
fundamentally change how people

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.763
get around region have a real

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:10.266
true transportation option

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.001
driving up on so this right

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:14.504
away that are greenhouse gas

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:15.938
emissions is what the big

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:18.074
moves. All of what can we

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:20.076
please but or take the whole

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.245
concept of come street. All of

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:22.812
our made record is in the

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:26.449
reached. At every. Door we have

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.785
managed and we have a speech

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.586
and Mike and Pat a lot of we

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:32.922
are team now that is

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:36.059
constructed in the five.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.561
Because. North train we can and

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:43.066
to the next level. But the

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:45.168
eighty ninety eight mile our

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:46.536
that would be compact. With

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:49.005
dropping mobile the heads of

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:50.139
the centers act. Get after.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.842
Highs in transit networks to

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:56.312
the smaller nay. Get mobility

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:56.779
hub and throughout our

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:58.381
community and an operator

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.249
system that's what we call the

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:02.852
bring to this team that's the

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:04.353
technology we have all the

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.856
information to help us make the

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:10.159
best transportation choice in

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:10.793
terms of time and be able to

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.462
pay for that right on our own.

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.464
New we're doing in this

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.232
planning in addition to this-

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:20.136
also the G. is using data to

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:26.342
help in more. Ways. Pretty

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.244
project. Will help move the dot

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:28.744
in read greenhouse gas

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:31.414
emissions starting just where

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:32.782
people work. Reach and where

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:36.619
they live this figure. Where

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:37.253
where is along the coast which

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.124
is important climate of all

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.091
right well dark. So the Boston

01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:46.062
populated area. Read and then

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:48.998
on where people work these are

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:49.632
the appointment setters in our

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:50.533
region and when you bring them

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.535
together there really all with

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.971
the same part of the India

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:58.474
region in the western third. At

01:02:58.541 --> 01:02:59.075
the one block me depressed and

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:06.949
fully. It. Now can we call our

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:08.684
our figure eight we have a full

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.753
connected high speed internet

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:14.157
now that's also ported I. Can

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:18.227
hi be met lanes hi stem that

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.129
this will port its movement in

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:22.999
there HM. Our poll thing and-

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:23.533
well highs transistor trip

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:30.506
travel option. And looking

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:31.140
brighter begins to much of what

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:34.710
is really focus. On what. Can

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:36.012
bill you look this coach I

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.481
think about each and were able

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:42.185
to. More than. Read the import

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:44.620
opportunity one we can start

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:45.721
and development in the what the

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:48.324
region. Not fall out it opens.

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:50.459
It is a miles trout direct

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:51.727
relation with greenhouse gas

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:54.096
emissions but also we can take

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:56.365
advantage of the carbon

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.134
sequestration through

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:58.701
preserving our open space as

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:03.039
the- well Beach mentioned it's

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.006
also important to look at

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.741
though most of our growth all

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:06.309
of our infrastructure is in

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:09.946
the- areas. So this is the area

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:10.580
where we're going to be making

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.915
the greatest investments in the

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.851
transportation network and need

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:16.385
to be thinking about the

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:17.019
resiliency and how we plan for

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:20.122
these. Light of sea level rise-

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.925
we've all seen the effects-

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:26.162
this is just one example one on

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:29.999
Taiwan a at it. This think is.

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:32.235
Action kind of similar we see

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:34.403
each that were having to

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.305
address this up for regular

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:36.906
basis of course what happened

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:41.010
over the weekend where what

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.979
we're we're dealing with is a

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:47.984
many right off and rainy this

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:48.584
step. That we toured as- well

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:52.722
as- on blast so it's from both

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:53.289
aspects with more violent

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:53.923
storms that we have to be

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:56.092
thinking about all of this in

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:57.793
collaboration with local

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.895
jurisdictions in this region

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.764
and so we have eighteen cities

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.899
one county ten local jerks ten

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:06.335
cities- our have our along the

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.638
coast the county is a small

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:12.208
piece but literally every. Be

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:14.277
with Israel Gen as is packed I

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:16.379
see level right even down to

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.414
those areas river valleys all

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:22.418
of these are areas that are a

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:26.088
half this is the more at risk

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:26.656
thank debt income ratio our

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:30.426
local state Senate's the fight

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.395
the way we but or- to become.

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:36.432
North south is. In right so

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:40.002
this is San Diego. But if you

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:42.705
look at this is. Here are give

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:46.575
me my five I. Feet of sea level

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:50.146
rise that said the top front

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:52.181
groups talked about. You can

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:56.218
help me that I'd with below in

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.620
the red line with. Five at and

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.220
the trolley these are made the

01:05:58.287 --> 01:05:59.989
court or as transportation

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.791
infrastructure in this region

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:04.427
and while we a lot of help the

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.228
black the Coast. Can anyone

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:08.230
there are big impacts also in

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.066
south county Coronado strand

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:10.599
you see these yellow areas

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.168
these are the it is the are

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.403
greatly. Impacted by two and a

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.639
half feet. A seat all right and

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.307
that shows that. Six point.

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:20.376
Eight in level so it is up and

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:24.113
down the coast there are major

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:24.747
at the a issues associated with

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:30.820
all yes. Well at Xin strip

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:31.487
tease possible Jennifer there's

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:32.755
a drip with everything from

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:36.592
knowing. When to close on the

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:39.929
street from the brace back. Now

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.997
we do are you made in for sure

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:42.565
in men's exam that. We can

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:43.899
continue to do that the repair

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:44.567
work to stabilize the bluffs in

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.001
the Los and corridor while we

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:49.905
are planning for an approach is

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:51.874
a sign mentioned actually move

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:54.443
that trade corridor further

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.910
east out of them less

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:58.080
vulnerable areas. The Los and

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:00.583
corridor think everyone here

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:02.385
this is the second is interest.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:08.357
L. but or a nation. Ask a day

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.259
third out in. You're about

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:14.330
billion in moved and something

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:18.234
that we can forget about is

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.869
portal to the F. early doesn't

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:20.403
the rock for it and access

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:24.473
which has a door in our and our

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.074
region and the economy of our

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:26.308
region so just to kind of wrap

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.344
up we talked about the bluffs

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:28.978
it's veto. It the right from up

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:34.817
above. Well at. The door upset

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:35.451
he wrote in the black from that

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:38.888
blow. Also bridges and other

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:40.022
infrastructure that help the

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:42.525
poor the quarter this is the

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:45.628
bridge today just imagine. Beat

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:48.030
of sea level rise- six feet you

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:49.999
see right away what that would

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:50.566
do in this is major of that

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:52.067
order so we just want to wrap

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:54.370
up by saying this region is

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:57.873
ready to work together to hold

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.042
multiple work efforts at local

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:04.180
Jr. Done a deep level it really

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.148
does take a regional approach

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.783
we can expect the city of

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:08.217
imperial beach to be

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:11.787
addressing- you know sea level

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:13.689
rise on their own or Encinitas

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.524
or del Mar Coronado it impacts

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.125
the airport the port of San

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:18.060
Diego in all of us and I think

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:20.196
working together is an

01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:20.696
important piece we are

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:21.897
extremely appreciative of the-

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:24.333
funding that we receive from

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.402
senator Atkins. To really start

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:28.103
some of the work in the you

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.939
don't continue the work on the

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:32.141
low side corridor there's a lot

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.876
more to do replying federal

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:37.480
grant we are looking at every

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.215
opportunity to secure funding

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.784
to help make this region as

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:46.121
resilient as possible under the

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:46.722
circumstances will. Also plan.

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:52.094
Reduce. With that I'll turn it

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:52.695
over to my friend here from NC

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:56.665
TV. Good afternoon- my name is

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:57.299
taken goal from NCTE filling in

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:58.267
here for our chair Tony Krantz

01:08:58.334 --> 01:08:59.802
he's been under the weather-

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:00.436
original presentation was just

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.505
gonna be a half hour of that

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:05.441
bluff slipping. From Delmar.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.041
Will save you the terror that

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:10.646
we've been in during for that-

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:14.016
NCG as a transportation agency-

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:15.784
for years under seventeen oh

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:17.720
three. A lot of the region

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:18.320
employer Xin of the checks was

01:09:18.387 --> 01:09:19.722
transferred over standard ****

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:21.657
love stabilization we work

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:22.291
closely with stand on that but

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:23.926
the operation the date a- that

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.262
is what in see TV does. We have

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.330
really two sides the coin we

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.165
have our infrastructure that we

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:32.334
operate on and we have the

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:33.836
vehicles that operate within on

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.671
that infrastructure- we have

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.740
transitioned are breeze fleet

01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:40.276
which is our bus fleet- almost

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:41.844
entirely from diesel to.

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:44.046
Natural gas- right now we have

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.915
a total fleet will out of a

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:47.750
hundred fifty vehicles nine of

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:49.752
those are CNG and so were I are

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.954
diesel the rest are CNG were

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:52.521
making that move towards a

01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:55.791
cleaner- fleet there. Are we

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:58.027
have currently on order were re

01:09:58.093 --> 01:09:58.627
looking to replace our seven

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:01.330
locomotives which are currently

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:01.897
tears zero we've had those

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:05.601
since inception- those are.

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:07.403
Moving up we're very shortly

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:09.672
are on order to our tear for a

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:11.307
clean diesel. Electric

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:14.176
locomotives so on the G. G.

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:16.078
application for Viçt that's

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:16.745
were removing all of it takes a

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.347
tremendous amount. In into the

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:18.881
buses off million dollars

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.349
locomotives I can imagine is

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:23.719
quite a bit more than that- to

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:25.888
do those rations- it takes

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:28.390
money that obviously we don't

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.459
collect from any of our

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:34.029
writers- we rely on the state

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:36.365
and the federal government for

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:36.832
a lot of those grant.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:45.874
Application. Our backup

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:46.475
generators for all of this is

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:47.776
to make sure that if the power

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.912
goes out we can still operate

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:50.512
trans for those that need it

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.381
some people that's the only way

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:53.983
that they can get around-

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:54.617
looking into that to see what

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.719
we can do in corporate in green

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:57.319
infrastructure in our capital

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:58.153
projects that we actually

01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:58.754
implement so that we can do

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.289
that in a sustainable manner.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:03.125
Dream is a huge issue along the

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:06.762
entire right away- with a lot

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:08.797
of the cities where we operate-

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:09.431
nobody wants to see it and we-

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:11.967
came. In for deep purple for a

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:13.569
bus to come. With ME delayed

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:14.136
for half an hour because the

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:19.475
track you can see what the-

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.042
it's like when it. When it's

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:20.643
been raining for more. Twenty

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:21.243
minutes. To meet these within

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:29.852
the corridor were implemented.

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:30.386
We Santa gone for capital

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:31.420
project temptation. Bridge

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.155
replacement from a hundred year

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.958
old timber to deal in. That of

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:38.260
that the potential- flood any

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:38.894
access so that when it does. X.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.630
are and then the one that is

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:45.401
obviously on every his mind is

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.770
our bluff stabilization- what

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.872
are we doing for that we've had

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:52.241
we're currently- marble for

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:57.479
stable to project- blood

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:58.080
stabilization project five is

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:58.681
actually push for were asked

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:00.749
for additional money from the

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:01.383
state on an emergency basis to

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:04.553
go under in a W. W. engine. To

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.188
use the tional. Have inspectors

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:06.755
out there twenty four seven

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.457
we've got crews out there.

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:09.091
Water situation is really saw a

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:11.026
lot of things happening you saw

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:13.062
the picture of the whole.

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:13.629
Keynote two feet from the

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:19.902
track- there are piles in a lot

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:20.502
of the block that are keeping

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:21.837
that up so there's no immediate

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:22.438
driven balling in. Tuition I'm

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:25.074
what is the economic loss

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.443
should something catastrophic

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:30.079
happened- we can't calculate

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:30.679
the entirety of that economic

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:32.247
loss in terms of freight good-

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:34.450
of all. Else but just the

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:36.452
replacement cost if the rail

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:37.820
were to be taken out you take

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.822
out a two hundred foot section.

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.391
Just replace that is about

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:42.925
three hundred ten million

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:45.994
dollars over a year almost nine

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:46.595
hundred thousand dollars a day

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:48.030
just to re route traffic to put

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:50.365
all that freight onto a truck

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:50.966
and put it on I five to get.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.568
People on the bus bridges they

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:53.936
can get to work that does not

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:56.572
take into account. Travel does

01:12:56.638 --> 01:13:00.943
not take into account the value

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.612
goods there moved in that right

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.013
which is quite a significant

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.918
impact on that. Again there.

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:10.519
The needed secured within that

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:11.754
rely uber tell patients run in

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.056
there that's not in there if

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:14.590
that cut we losing from we

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:16.158
lose. Lose a so it is a big

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:18.127
deal- what we are asking the

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.895
state and the federal

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:20.329
government and grant

01:13:20.395 --> 01:13:22.030
applications we have- to their

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:25.701
open right now- I know for del

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:28.270
Mar bluffs five I think- that

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.872
one is out for about thirty

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:31.907
billion dollars. As the sun

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:32.508
said it's probably closer to

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:33.609
ninety to get the thing done-

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.944
and that is not. In our next

01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:37.679
year that's a long term of. A

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.948
long term item. So this one's

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:42.417
going to be with us for a while

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:43.051
we're looking for solutions to

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:45.287
that and as my executive

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:45.888
director would say show me the

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:48.323
money. A five we have money to

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:50.726
do it will do it. The biggest

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:59.835
interested bring that together.

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:03.205
Good afternoon I first want to

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:06.809
thank the chair for inviting

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:07.409
already to participate in this

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:08.010
important discussion today. My

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:10.279
name is Brandon read on the- I

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:12.915
will fairs at the airport-

01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:16.118
before joining their fourteen

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:16.785
years ago actually was the city

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:18.086
to list as climate medic

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:22.057
adaptation met. From the circle

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:22.724
for. Really not too shocking to

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:24.092
say that airports are

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.328
incredibly important

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:26.862
transportation asset when

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.263
you're looking at the

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:29.898
California county or even the

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.701
San Diego economy last year our

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:34.770
airports International Airport

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:36.271
twenty million passenger. About

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.640
a hundred thousand tons of move

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:42.311
through the can that can help

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.213
contribute to the airports

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:44.813
annual economic benefit to the

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.380
region about twelve billion

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:50.052
dollars. I in this map- on the

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:52.521
display shows it's black that

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:55.023
is a five passed yours. I think

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.491
it's just a great weather are

01:14:56.558 --> 01:15:00.596
you are a business our resident

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:01.230
or visitor comments to break go

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:05.834
spur. Bear serves at. The key

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:07.870
to this region worse than all

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:08.437
the act make. Connected with

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:11.940
that. I'm I'm a little more

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.142
optimistic it's just my nature

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.878
about one thing I wanted to

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.679
note is that- sea level rise is

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:18.313
something we've actually been

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.982
thinking about for awhile in

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:22.417
this region in twenty twelve

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:25.254
all the jurisdictions are on

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.756
the air the cynical baking

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.992
together enveloped a joint

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.526
level rise out of two. Strategy

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:33.896
twelve. The wild wild west

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:34.529
prime an adaptation no. Think

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:36.064
about it. And this is really

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:37.766
one of the first studies like

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:38.300
this that happened in the

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:41.904
nation so we had some really

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:42.537
great momentum that I wanted to

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:44.172
recognize. Of airport authority

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:46.174
of the last year's formalized

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:48.577
our- strategies if you will-

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:52.481
more- with our resilience plan.

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:53.115
Where we look at the airports

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:56.885
expo. She loves ice precipitate

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:58.854
change and ting he- through.

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:03.225
The century and then I did some

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:04.826
quantifiable. Sure that are

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:05.427
doing we need to do to be more

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:10.465
recipients. So to sum it maps

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:12.234
maps are thing we can about. At

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:17.272
this age. Before I get to the

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:17.906
mall going that help to warm up

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:21.944
AB T. strategy he's just.

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:32.321
Federal. The fate we have run

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:32.854
away see that it down the

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:37.693
middle. The river. Going north.

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:40.662
The north we have a target. If

01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:43.865
but he's an- users axe them I'm-

01:16:43.932 --> 01:16:46.168
Washington Street. One thing

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:48.236
that people don't always

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.105
realize that we actually aren't

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:50.706
right on the water we have

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.174
others between us in the water

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.311
line- and we have a locked so

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:58.914
starting on our southeast

01:16:58.981 --> 01:16:59.448
corner this is actually US

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:02.284
Coast Guard. Station. We harbor

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:07.122
on which the poor S. and

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:08.256
Esther's on our- own through

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:11.793
have the same. Property. Fourth

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.394
we have the marine corps with

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:16.498
deep so I can't stress enough

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.533
that regional solutions

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.201
collaborative approaches for us

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.902
it's a must because we can do

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:23.872
everything on site we can but

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:24.473
if we're not working with the

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:26.408
port in the city and other. As

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.009
a really help us at the end of

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:32.714
the day. So this is just these

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:33.348
are just some maps that we've

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:36.718
done using cost us which is a

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:37.986
of off the shelf Bob playing

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:40.589
of. Twenty hundred. At the blue

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:44.926
is. Flooding can adjust the

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:45.527
level rises. Those store one

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:50.165
your form of. So if in twenty

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:52.567
for the you know I see some

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:56.104
storm surge flooding along with

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:56.838
harbor I've she is the an

01:17:56.905 --> 01:18:00.142
animal. At point to the airport

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:06.615
and on the- very. Our we

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:07.249
hundred and if center building

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:10.619
again we cease storm surge

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:12.387
really creating most of the

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.189
flooding pattern at those two

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:19.027
corners well of are pretty.

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.328
When we go to a more extreme C.

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:22.864
là press the five. Billion I'm

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:28.136
you can. The map start. Mark I

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:30.439
didn't see much more serious

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.107
now along the entire harbor

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:36.545
five. This group Steve Kerr

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:39.247
water. And we have more

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:42.684
distance thing. On west side of

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:44.619
our can't as well. They're

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:46.088
actually deliver. Five if you

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:51.026
can. If you go on line down you

01:18:51.093 --> 01:19:01.837
know the- factors for the level

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:02.404
rise in store which actually

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:08.310
would look worse. Of those who

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:12.314
fled. Anymore since the cut out

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:17.953
a with. We actually. There are

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.489
very airport and I'm bringing

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:21.056
up only because fought for

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:24.993
actions today. Really can have

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:25.527
a big impact in twenty one

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.996
hooked. And Fuller close but we

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:30.065
didn't make those changes that

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:30.632
I just highlighted with sea

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:31.867
level rise in mind your we're

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.869
fixing drainage issues we're

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:35.637
just preparing the site for

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:36.238
construction so just imagine

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:37.906
what we can do when we have

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:40.108
this information to inform.

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:40.709
That design of a new terminal

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:45.981
for say. Little optimism. So I

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:46.615
wanted and just with that sort

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:48.150
of some observations and

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:48.650
lessons learned from the

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:52.254
airports experience. I'm one

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.256
again as I think now is time

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:56.324
to. Create resilient is in the

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.627
sciences forever changing and

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:03.265
is rates up have to use the

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:03.899
better for me we have how to.

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:10.605
Is this our how infrastructure

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:11.239
this transfer in infrastructure

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:14.109
that's- to our economy. A big

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:16.077
part of what we found is really

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:18.079
the need for more granular data

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:20.348
that's C. là eyes and rural

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:24.219
but also pride like data I've

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:26.388
would have just use the our

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:26.988
shop you will thousand model.

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:35.997
Of thanks. But again we had our

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:36.565
in our day and so we have a

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:37.165
seat see we are a little bit

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:37.966
better shape another thing I

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:38.500
just would point out where

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.134
working with doctor merry feels

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.468
group at scripts and the port

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:40.969
of San Diego to deploy a

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:41.870
network of sea level rise

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:42.437
centers in San Diego bay to

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.005
figure out how does that storm

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:46.041
surge which really is actually

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:47.976
probably the most impactful

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.578
part of all of the all these

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:51.980
impacts how does that work in a

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:52.514
semi closed embayment as

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:55.750
opposed to an open coastline so

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:56.351
that'll really help us define.

01:20:56.418 --> 01:21:00.288
Those models. And then I can

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:01.823
see at the airport we're

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.259
embedding climate resilience

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:04.859
you can climb at TI in toward

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:10.131
the making system. So. Every

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:11.933
little prop and jet he was

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.369
ending for the team and we

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:19.140
don't give a **** this point.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:19.774
Documents you know and for the

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:21.910
feet four feet we taped thing

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:25.013
the best a double. Time because

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:25.580
it's get involving prop yes

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:28.016
point it at its a critical part

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:31.720
of our decision making process.

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:32.354
And then I just want to point

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.589
out another thing out of this

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.191
little study from twenty twelve.

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:40.462
The jurisdictions around the

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:41.997
table that work on a real as

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:44.165
well it really helps when sort

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:44.766
of the on the ground practice

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:48.236
get together. I'm sure lessons

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:49.704
learned. And Richard is and

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:50.338
through this this is one of the

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.907
impetus for creating the sandy

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:53.541
regional climate collaborative.

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.443
I'm and now there are similar

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.779
collaborative all across the

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:00.081
state- so just one highlighted

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:02.217
those type of. Forms where

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:02.817
academia comes together with

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:04.753
non profit business and public

01:22:04.819 --> 01:22:08.356
agencies because this is

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:08.957
certainly an all hands on deck

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:14.929
kind of problem. With that I

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:15.530
thank you for your time thank

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:26.074
you. Yeah great. Yeah my name's

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:28.043
I call her and I'm with. The

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:30.912
director Barbara county chin

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:31.546
and I also see are aquaculture

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:32.414
bluetec program and I mention

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.582
that because it will be talking

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.051
about- what mayor dina doctor

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:39.788
about and some of our- since

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:40.355
two sealevel rise that were

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:41.856
working on so. The poor you

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:42.424
probably pass along harbor

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.925
drive going to the airport when

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:44.559
you're going to and from your

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:47.862
thanksgiving vacation- but we

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:49.631
are San Diego bay we have see.

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:54.235
Sec about six thousand acres

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:54.836
around San Diego bay that we

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:57.138
are the trustee for the state

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:57.739
of California to manage those

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:03.845
resources. We have about twenty

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:08.316
two public park so come on down

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:08.950
to visit I'm more than happy to

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:17.158
the- we. Bob yes our water is.

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:24.199
Bogart. And of course public

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:32.107
and one TV along. As it. The

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:32.674
islands around twenty eight

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:36.411
thank Montel were first

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:37.011
fisheries navigation wrecked

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:40.448
environmental stewardship. It's

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:43.985
called the penny this is. We

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:47.722
also regularly including

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:50.425
coastal act the port act in a

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:50.992
lot of weeds under. Assembly

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.694
six one. Which required us to

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:54.863
look at our bone ability for

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.998
sea level rise. We have a lot

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:57.599
of plans and policy center on

01:23:57.665 --> 01:23:59.968
our website it good night time

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:00.602
reading there we by you to take

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:02.337
a look bad. Assembly bill six

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:07.075
the what was. Specifically to

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:12.914
force. Impacts kilo right look

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:18.686
at to fix he will rise time Ms

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:22.924
refining telling to be of. Talk

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:25.193
steak burgers and work them to

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:25.760
answer questions that court

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:27.662
that was due last year.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.131
Whenever AB adaptation policies

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:32.634
and we have me I. This is a

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:36.137
example you have to use both

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:39.374
kids but we also looking living

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:41.876
or lines up that. It has in

01:24:41.943 --> 01:24:46.014
Marin only for. Tional but

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.417
lends. I mean things I an

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:52.387
instruction. Step back to be a

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:55.657
to accommodate. Of all right.

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:58.126
So the port is also a large

01:24:58.193 --> 01:25:00.128
partner with the US navy- we've

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.464
been partnering them for

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:04.199
decades starting with our

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.134
integrated natural resources

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:08.203
management plan which is only

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:10.405
joint dot in the country and we

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:14.209
also have. A random. With the

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:18.179
V. eight ten the only be I'm-

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:19.948
agree this the next three with

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:24.118
AB. And local group so

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:26.087
basically we're nay on the

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:26.654
level rise and coast leading

01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:30.792
the bay. I wanted to. Mention

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:32.227
as Brandon mention are- wave

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:32.827
monitoring pilot project with

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:37.999
scripts. And I'm personal. A

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:42.337
lot of the work that hearing of.

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:44.405
If you the rest of ones that

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:48.209
will help. At sealevel rise.

01:25:48.276 --> 01:25:52.347
Trees planted in. Three but

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:52.947
when an acting nine will have

01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:58.386
that's. So not only does it

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:02.190
have with all right here

01:26:02.257 --> 01:26:02.790
question Gen for both wetland

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:08.463
in yoga. I'm sick to bay has

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:12.367
about fifty in person the bill

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:18.139
in the state. I'm a. That the

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:18.706
three is more. Than forest's

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:24.679
general so. Eight eight two one

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.447
six working on health under

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.283
section couple years is for us

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:30.785
in the bay are clueless the

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.054
city beach on the right and a

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:34.322
city of Saint go on left. And

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:38.192
that is a former stock pond we

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:44.165
want store to. Well let at a-

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:46.100
meeting bang- in the fun from

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:48.236
that mitigation bank with. The

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:48.670
local community with

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:54.242
infrastructure and jobs. In we

01:26:54.309 --> 01:26:56.244
started during current studies

01:26:56.311 --> 01:27:00.114
as we think this restoration

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:00.748
for creating a ticket thank you

01:27:00.815 --> 01:27:04.452
be about an 89% by your to one

01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:12.460
hundred. Big see. That part

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:13.061
because when that price for it

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:18.399
if. We also have a cut in to be.

01:27:18.466 --> 01:27:29.911
Up. To clean we see this. So

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:32.213
here's the part Leo I will que

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:37.919
sure. Growing see we of

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:40.521
cleaning up the mess in the a

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:42.490
and a couple of projects that

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:48.096
all dive into you. I'm. No pan

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:56.070
into some guys dive. Do you

01:27:56.137 --> 01:28:00.508
like three D. can for as a.

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:02.310
Using kelp kelp into

01:28:02.377 --> 01:28:06.280
corporation well we they to

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:12.553
feed water. Gallons a day an

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:19.894
instant also there's also carp.

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:22.563
The we are pop culture call one

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:26.634
eight three I am. The company

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:30.271
that working their cell to

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:37.178
arrest. The thing rips apple

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:41.315
Charlie. Were hurt can hope

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:49.991
that. May make. A rap but also

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:53.127
make pool in missional at which

01:28:53.194 --> 01:29:04.205
will so. At Easter and also

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:07.975
help with currency question in.

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:08.576
Conclusion we're seeing a lot

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:10.645
of work- to resources habitat

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:11.813
restoration mitigation banking-

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:14.382
in innovative technology clean

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:18.286
aquaculture to you with carbon

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:18.920
seek patient all help with reap

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:27.695
billions. So thank you. Thank

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:30.131
is somehow back on track on

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.200
time so I'm sure that do you

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:35.770
have any questions from our

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:36.404
member legislators before we go

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:42.343
into public. Ten questions. And

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:43.778
in the coastal protection and I

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:46.280
wondered what is the number

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:48.316
there how much money are are

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:49.917
you able to just from your own

01:29:49.984 --> 01:29:52.086
efforts are put forward towards

01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:57.658
your plan. Gives us an idea of

01:29:57.725 --> 01:30:00.428
what additional money we need

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.028
it be opting for no like men

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:04.031
that matching funds and things

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.733
like that that. Are certainly.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.269
Available we if we can show

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:10.271
that the communities to see

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:12.106
these are doing a lot on their

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:14.041
own- the state needs to step in

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:16.077
and I think it also helps with

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:18.346
a federal. Matching funds just

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:20.248
like it does for transportation.

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:23.050
I'm so I can answer that over

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:23.551
the past two years we've

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.553
accumulated- about five hundred

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:29.791
thousand. Dollars in the tier

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:30.391
to find in August two coastal

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:31.225
zone management. I just I just

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:34.228
like to put that out there for

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:34.829
discussion when we get back to

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:36.764
Sacramento that. When you

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:41.536
cities that are stepping up to

01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:42.170
address this and there are. No

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:44.071
the loan- Indians out there

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:46.507
trying to you know support and

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:47.775
protect their immunities that

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:50.144
we should be first and foremost

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:51.879
to advocate for them at the

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:54.649
state. All to do a matching

01:30:54.715 --> 01:30:57.318
funds sort of program in our

01:30:57.385 --> 01:30:57.952
budget. With the fat with our

01:30:58.019 --> 01:30:59.854
federal representatives also

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:00.421
because it is you know it's

01:31:00.488 --> 01:31:02.023
kind of show me the money for a

01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:02.657
lot of these projects that are

01:31:02.723 --> 01:31:04.625
very very important. So I just

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:06.394
like to note that but

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:06.994
congratulations I think when

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:12.333
you get a local tax past that

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:12.967
connects directly to something.

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:15.937
An official odd to your

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:18.573
community the buyer whatever.

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:23.277
president. Those of us who are

those we had to fight to get

01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:39.393
him to pass. For our- roads

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:47.969

a luxury that we don't get to

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:07.822
have a more in session hello

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:09.957
the latest for a long time here

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.959
from all different perspectives

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:16.097
of says the I said. Get

01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:16.697
everyone giving us so much of

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:19.934
apple Tom. Start with the most

01:32:20.001 --> 01:32:22.303
urgent to terms the dhamma

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.937
blasts and out of San data into

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:24.105
T. wants to address this- but

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:25.773
the funding that senator Atkins

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.307
was able to secure in this

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:30.211
year's budget- I. Was on I

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:30.878
think I heard you say that will

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:31.913
have- since our deliverable in

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:36.550
next year or so have the

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:40.354
desire. For a. The civilization

01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:44.191
five we need. Money to

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:46.627
construct the actual piles and

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:49.063
you get a number for what

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.498
eighteen million dollars two

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:54.602
five and six design and build

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:55.169
an engine that would be like

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.438
most projects a blend of local

01:32:57.505 --> 01:32:58.039
state federal funding of some

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:02.310
club and that would be very

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:03.978
happy to. Local funding into.

01:33:04.045 --> 01:33:07.581
We have the state and if it

01:33:07.648 --> 01:33:08.249
comes in not to hold you. For a

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:09.684
specific figure today but a

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.385
ballpark figure of what that be

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:12.019
from a state perspective eighty

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:16.991
nine million a. But that is why

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:21.629
he's very good at what he got.

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:22.096
The you can get then I

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:27.668
appreciate. Willing to discuss

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:28.235
this to the state level any

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.905
money can we get to just simply

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:33.708
do five and six to realize

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:39.480
issue. At four twelve avoid. It

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:41.415
will it will be much you have

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:41.983
to look at the longer term

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:44.285
solution that will cost more. I

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:44.919
think you have issue saying out

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:56.664
of forum. For the server. For

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.733
this plan is on the table at

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:02.370
again assemblymember hard

01:34:02.436 --> 01:34:04.071
discussing a lot of the citing

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:06.741
issues there and you do not be

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:10.511
shy minister how can put this

01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:11.145
issue obviously in a center at.

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:14.248
People engaged. This is urgent

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.617
and you are your your comment.

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.185
Above for both agencies-

01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:21.389
illustrate this isn't just an

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:23.190
inconvenience not of couple

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:23.824
commuters on the coaster that's

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:24.392
going to be inconvenient so

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.226
that would mean to me by

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:27.928
itself. This is truly could be

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:30.331
catastrophic our economy. Not

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:32.266
just locally before nation and

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.035
I want act accordingly and show

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:37.004
the kind of urgency from the

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:38.339
state level that. Is

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:38.906
appropriate for the service

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:45.279
without committee you. She

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:45.913
needs of ends up parts of the

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:50.384
state so- thank you again at.

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:51.018
Coming out of I just want to.

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:52.853
Amplify that the words of you

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:56.190
know did a great job of. Begin

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:58.325
to something that this has been

01:34:58.392 --> 01:34:58.959
a few of the seemingly zero sum

01:34:59.026 --> 01:34:59.960
game in when we when we buy

01:35:00.027 --> 01:35:01.896
into that kind of. That I mean

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:03.931
nothing gets done and if I

01:35:03.998 --> 01:35:04.498
think all in this room this

01:35:04.565 --> 01:35:06.367
afternoon because you believe

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:07.902
this is an urgent issue. And

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:10.104
any sort of still meeting of it

01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:10.738
is not beneficial I appreciate

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:12.173
you. Taking the number things

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.542
we can do- that there is broad

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:15.943
consensus forecast what senator

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.544
Bates is getting to a moment

01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:18.179
ago- and I would urge that

01:35:18.245 --> 01:35:20.581
continued focus on on those

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:23.684
kinds of issues- informed as to

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:24.285
what we can do and I think.

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:25.886
Many in this room I know not

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:26.987
everyone may realize. The to a

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:30.558
year where- you know we collect

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:31.158
legislative ideas and figure

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:32.593
out priorities to address in

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:38.799
it- and so. This is the perfect

01:35:38.866 --> 01:35:39.400
time to say you know Hey this

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:42.403
not that. This week here this

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:44.572
repeal their this internet

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.440
legislation here- these are

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:46.974
often while we hope these

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:48.976
hearings at this time of year

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:49.577
and stuff. That I think of AB

01:35:49.643 --> 01:35:50.211
wonder leave your one me what

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.813
should come next immediate we-

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.414
should be in contact with any

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:54.048
of our offices saying. You know

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:58.018
here's a legislative idea this

01:35:58.085 --> 01:35:58.586
year is a budget ask for the

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:00.955
coming year. Or his image to

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:01.589
repeat because it just doesn't

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:02.189
work anymore- in the context

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:03.858
of. Changing sea level rise so.

01:36:03.924 --> 01:36:05.926
I just put that general plea

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:09.063
out. And then lastly of doctor

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:09.663
Merrifield still here I think

01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:12.133
he has. A you you kind of put

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:14.135
it. Last by which I. Because

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:14.735
role that deliverables right a

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:16.737
lot of this is information

01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:17.872
coming and it's fantastic but

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.907
really. What can we do and ms

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:22.409
Barnhart I. Took note of that.

01:36:22.476 --> 01:36:22.977
A substantial reduction in

01:36:23.043 --> 01:36:30.518
carbon emissions- maybe just.

01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:31.118
Of a moment at the microphone

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.553
of what you might actually.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.187
Suggest we do I think we have

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:36.790
some notions their bills up for

01:36:36.857 --> 01:36:37.424
around in the legislature. Some

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:38.058
have been successful some have

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:40.628
not been. From your person from

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:41.061
your position in the

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:41.695
professional. Background what

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:42.563
would you like to see the state

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:43.164
of California due to actually

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:45.966
speak to that. Bullet point it

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:46.534
is one one one one long but-

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.435
what it. There's a lot I think

01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:52.706
we're at the point where. We

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:53.340
appreciate we see because my we

01:36:53.407 --> 01:36:57.912
appreciate. In the. I'm really

01:36:57.978 --> 01:36:59.914
planning hi it doesn't quite

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:00.548
have the detail we need for our

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:02.283
sort of like- going forward in

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:03.784
the ten twenty her oxen

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:04.418
thinking about what we need to

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:06.887
do now ice on these adaptive

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:09.290
pathways stop steps so I'm I'm

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.225
really in favor of expanding

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:12.459
what we did in. Beach more

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:13.928
communities along the coast to

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:17.898
build in this resilient-

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:20.267
infrastructure standing for in

01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:21.902
for predicting and for a going

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:26.073
forward and I think more

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:26.707
projects like that would really

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:31.845
help community. Well we are so

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:34.215
fortunate scripts here in San

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:34.815
Diego I know you were because

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:36.383
beyond just our our county

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:36.917
limits will grateful that

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:37.384
you're here. Thank you

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:38.085
Esperanza shall follow up on

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:38.719
that real quick if you wouldn't

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.921
mind- specifically when you

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:41.822
said aggressive reduction of

01:37:41.889 --> 01:37:44.058
greenhouse gas emissions what

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:46.060
were the fob top five things

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:48.529
California can do. Next year.

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:51.732
To achieve that bullet point. I

01:37:51.799 --> 01:37:53.467
think for California one two

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:53.934
three four and five is

01:37:54.001 --> 01:37:55.369
transportation I mean I thought

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:57.605
the send a presentation was

01:37:57.671 --> 01:37:58.239
right on point. We have to bill

01:37:58.305 --> 01:37:58.872
communities were doing or what

01:37:58.939 --> 01:37:59.473
were we doing much traveling

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.441
between. Where we working where

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:04.511
we live. I was I thought the

01:38:04.578 --> 01:38:05.613
vision. Keeper for was system

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:08.515
that we can reach that. But

01:38:08.582 --> 01:38:09.049
that's that's the future I

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:15.356
think for California. Yeah I

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:24.465
think there's some. I. I think

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:25.065
that we can do a southern cal

01:38:25.132 --> 01:38:29.703
legislators of collective. And

01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:31.839
it is we talk about cabin trade

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:32.439
funnies pictures California

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:34.475
their fair share we have been

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:35.876
receiving our fair share now

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:36.377
typically transportation

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:38.112
dollars are are are dealt out

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:40.080
on a population basis or rap

01:38:40.147 --> 01:38:40.714
based on your population those

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:42.616
are. Let's go up in a pretty

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:43.951
fair fashion but the cap and

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:45.886
trade has not so something we

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:46.387
need to talk about as a

01:38:46.453 --> 01:38:48.155
southern California delegation

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:52.226
going to this next year is how

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:53.861
do we get our fair share of cap

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:56.030
and trade. A to address in

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:59.700
nexus between the purpose of

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:02.002
having trading right and what

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:04.004
the ultimately use her. Can I

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:04.605
give you an example this last

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:08.142
budget. There's a hundred

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:08.776
million dollars- from cabinetry

01:39:08.842 --> 01:39:10.210
on ongoing committed on an

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:11.745
ongoing basis to the Central

01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:12.413
Valley. To provide clean water.

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:13.847
For there's no nexus between

01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:16.383
the purpose of the cap and

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:16.984
trade dollars and clean water

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:17.618
doesn't mean that clean water

01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:18.152
is not needed. But that's

01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:20.187
really a general fund

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:21.922
expenditure that should not be

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:23.757
a cap and trade expenditure

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:25.759
that the legislature- committed

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:26.360
to so those are the kinds of

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.329
dynamics that we could walk.

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:29.830
Watch for as we head into next

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:31.899
year fair share and making sure

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:32.499
that the dollars are spent. In

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:41.942
a- fashion. Did you have a

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:50.451
specific thing sure. Following

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:52.252
climate change since nineteen

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:53.787
ninety nine when I did a face

01:39:53.854 --> 01:39:55.889
some climate change could you

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:58.025
please identify yourself yes I

01:39:58.092 --> 01:40:00.227
I'm Christopher those don't

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:00.728
know I mean I work with

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:04.498
sandbags. I live in dolma. I'm

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:06.600
I've been. Interesting climate

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:08.335
change since the nineteen

01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:10.270
eighties when I read an article

01:40:10.337 --> 01:40:10.838
in Scientific American that

01:40:10.904 --> 01:40:15.075
alerted me to the sea level

01:40:15.142 --> 01:40:15.676
rise. Only the thesis on the

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:16.243
subject in nineteen eighty

01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.910
nine. But what I've seen in the

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:20.114
trenches here over the last

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:20.714
twenty years working in seated

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:25.753
in San Diego. Easily get money.

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:28.155
For checks that. Improve the

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:28.722
capacity of a transportation

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:30.791
system. What's very difficult

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:31.792
is it meant. For resiliency.

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:36.029
And as we soaring Collins

01:40:36.096 --> 01:40:36.597
presentation the bridge St

01:40:36.663 --> 01:40:38.365
Peter. With six feet a syllable

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:38.999
rise will be at the top of that

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:40.167
bridge. But it's very hard to

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:40.801
get the money to replace that

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.035
bridge because- it doesn't

01:40:42.102 --> 01:40:43.937
qualify as a capacity enhancing

01:40:44.004 --> 01:40:45.839
project. It's an old bridge.

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:49.810
That is not resilient. And said

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:50.411
my appeal to you as a group of

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:51.779
that. This is trying to make

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:52.312
some. Money available for

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:53.947
transportation resiliency. As

01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:56.016
opposed to always saying you

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:56.650
have to increase service so you

01:40:56.717 --> 01:41:02.423
have to. In a move more people

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:03.857
we can't move any painful if

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:04.425
the bridges on the war. Well

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:08.028
the bluffs files a. Many for

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:12.032
resistance is might flee. Thank

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:15.903
you. Thank you. I wanna I wanna

01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:16.537
thank everybody removed public

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:18.338
comment of them. You know when

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:20.974
we get that impact. That

01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:22.609
assembly member Gloria was

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:25.779
talking about for justifying

01:41:25.846 --> 01:41:28.382
the del Mar blast. I think one

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:30.083
number that I see clearly from

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:30.684
today's presentation hopefully

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.119
all took that with the two. Is

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:34.288
the impact and goods and

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:35.923
services it would be if the del

01:41:35.989 --> 01:41:38.258
Mar blasts. Not available are

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:44.498
the dump the. To the del Mar is

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:45.999
not available so you know if we

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:47.768
if you that number please share

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:48.368
with us now but otherwise the

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:50.337
idea right now but we have the

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:53.774
economic impact. Of goods

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:54.374
movement in the region we can

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:57.945
make that inviolable to. Hey

01:41:58.011 --> 01:42:00.180
guests thing is to be with us

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:02.749
today talking about how do we

01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:05.219
preserve what's wonderful about

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:07.855
our coastline. But really faced

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:09.990
allergies of the next hundred

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:11.725
years and level right. Arm you

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:12.292
know I a one I think all the

01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:14.328
agencies that are here today I

01:42:14.394 --> 01:42:15.996
want to thank my team. Cecilia

01:42:16.063 --> 01:42:18.131
Montez my legislative director

01:42:18.198 --> 01:42:19.733
she is a veteran of the

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.334
building and I she was the one

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.069
who is primarily responsible

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:23.871
this so let's give the some

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:24.404
jazz hands Visalia. With

01:42:24.471 --> 01:42:26.206
Claudia Espinoza from my team

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:28.108
we have Alex he won my district

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:30.210
director heather Conklin is

01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:32.379
somewhere my chief of staff rob

01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:34.214
Charles a somewhere Fernando is

01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:36.483
the- you know he's actually

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:40.187
feel right for Mister- and our

01:42:40.254 --> 01:42:41.655
fifth wheel right for Oceanside

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:42.256
but he actually with. The V.

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:45.959
today's a good job in and out-

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:46.493
and so made it all work I

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.828
wasn't really clear about that-

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:49.796
it when I when I pull this all

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:53.767
together. What I hear is four

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:56.069
main things. We need to pursue

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:56.703
pursuit aggressive reduction of

01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:59.873
greenhouse gas emissions. And

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:00.440
that means it's gonna be a

01:43:00.507 --> 01:43:03.677
change in our way of life. And

01:43:03.744 --> 01:43:06.013
changing aye. Cations first

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:06.647
many years changes so hard for

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:08.549
folks except. But if we want a

01:43:08.615 --> 01:43:12.619
planet for our children we're

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:14.087
just going to embrace it. And

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:15.856
waste well through it together

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:19.960
I really. Appreciate surge

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:23.864
dina. Caught let's get away

01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:24.431
from talking and retreat and

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:24.932
talk about what are the

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:25.766
adaptation strategies we can

01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:26.333
agree on- because with our

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.701
science is changing so much.

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:28.335
You know the second thing is I

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:32.139
heard was. The more Deventer if

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:34.174
it data driven modeling and I

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:35.742
think what we've heard of

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:37.844
scripts is doing a really great

01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:38.378
job we have spending for

01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:42.416
resiliency. I think what I want

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:42.950
to thank the port and the

01:43:43.016 --> 01:43:43.584
airport authority in sand act

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:46.420
and see TV I know you guys are

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:47.888
on the frontline of this and I

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:48.422
really think the airport a

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:49.756
thought for how you present in

01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:51.925
it and she but it's possible-

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:53.961
to plan for it- the last thing

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:56.330
is- our second to last two

01:43:56.396 --> 01:44:00.000
things- we do need to move to

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:01.969
action. Some of the actions for

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:04.071
funding some of that action is

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:05.973
policies- echo the sentiments

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:08.175
assembly member Gloria now is

01:44:08.241 --> 01:44:09.843
the time we're putting together

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:14.247
our build cages budget asks

01:44:14.314 --> 01:44:14.815
this is when we need to come

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:17.884
together- do like I really

01:44:17.951 --> 01:44:20.020
pushed under Bates about asking

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:22.556
funds- cities who are

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:23.156
committing and putting. Their

01:44:23.223 --> 01:44:25.993
get in the game let's see what

01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:28.028
how can help them I think we

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.997
see coastal cities when this

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:31.898
arm know that every he has the

01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:32.532
capacity so how do we have the

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:37.738
equity component in it- and I

01:44:37.804 --> 01:44:39.673
do see Coronado and AB are

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:40.173
probably really on the

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.476
frontline what we're gonna do.

01:44:42.542 --> 01:44:44.077
And I really urge you are any

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:46.213
five and you have to fight

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:50.817
traffic. Down or we can go have

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:54.287
dinner. Make a little. Later

01:44:54.354 --> 01:44:56.590
and so when we look at this. We

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:59.993
have a- board together this is

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:00.594
the first of many hearings. I

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:07.868
think it's really important

01:45:07.934 --> 01:45:08.502
we're starting here we're gonna

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:09.102
do them throughout the state.

01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:10.337
She keeps I want to take of an.

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:10.937
We do things assembly touched

01:45:11.004 --> 01:45:14.408
up but up her feet here looked

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:26.453
experience as we know we saw

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:27.087
those maps about Ventura thing

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:27.721
in the bay area we know this is

they're more than fifteen

01:45:34.428 --> 01:45:36.029
people you get thirty seconds

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:36.596
if there's less than fifty

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:38.165
people you get a minute. So

01:45:38.231 --> 01:45:38.765
please calm line up for public

01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:42.436
comment. As we do have to and

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:48.508
five I'm sorry. Serve only five

01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:49.076
people line up you each get

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:56.450
three minutes. Going now.

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:57.084
There's people lined up you get

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:57.818
five minutes is all works. I'll

01:45:57.884 --> 01:46:00.854
try to be brief okay thank you

01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:02.756
so much for your name for the

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:05.726
record. Look I live in Cardiff.

01:46:05.792 --> 01:46:10.530
Not on the beach. Access. Some

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:13.967
comments on some things that

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:14.534
were said today in the last

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:15.135
month and things were said to

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.903
the- and- treat is never going

01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:19.439
to. The Xin is gonna take far

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:19.973
longer than I have. I was

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.042
suggested legislature get the

01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.609
coastal commission off that

01:46:22.676 --> 01:46:25.779
page. Suggest that you look at

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:26.413
other areas of the country not

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.016
and also in Europe. I grew up

01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:30.584
in New England where they've

01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:34.020
been fighting. Coastal erosion

01:46:34.087 --> 01:46:34.621
for over a hundred fifty years

01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:37.858
in winning. At any of that

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:40.127
stuff here and I think we need

01:46:40.193 --> 01:46:40.761
to look outside of California

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:43.797
for some answers- I used to

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:44.331
take the closer to work in

01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:46.166
downtown San Diego stopped.

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:48.201
Partly because he took an hour

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:53.874
and a half extra than driving.

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:54.474
And also up in that bluff is

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:58.111
scared of these a salary I was

01:46:58.178 --> 01:47:00.013
in government and

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:00.580
transportation for forty odd

01:47:00.647 --> 01:47:02.082
years. Looking at subway

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:06.386
systems around the world. I

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:11.691
would. Get off the bluffs fast

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:13.527
as possible not miles inland

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:21.067
because it that's what we're.

01:47:21.134 --> 01:47:21.701
Cutting over of one a one three

01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:23.537
del Mar. The be inconvenient

01:47:23.603 --> 01:47:28.141
for. But that's house somewhere

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:32.145
well to Boston. Bill Tom. Right

01:47:32.212 --> 01:47:34.481
now I'm- right wing more

01:47:34.548 --> 01:47:37.984
earthquakes and we do. It's you

01:47:38.051 --> 01:47:39.920
know something needs to be done

01:47:39.986 --> 01:47:40.453
now- I've noticed in the

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.955
standard budget there's been no

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:44.057
money even the study some of

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:46.226
the stuff for the last five

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:48.128
years I suggest that. Thank you

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:52.899
final. In is something that was

01:47:52.966 --> 01:47:56.036
only mentioned I also lived in

01:47:56.102 --> 01:48:01.041
the Pacific Northwest. Oregon

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:01.675
Washington and British coal all

01:48:01.741 --> 01:48:06.680
have. Marked he wished includes.

01:48:06.746 --> 01:48:07.280
Because to not to do have king

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:12.452
tides to have. I seen one sign

01:48:12.519 --> 01:48:12.986
in California. Is the holy

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:15.488
shores at the beach. And then

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:16.122
it doesn't tell you where to go

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:21.728
it just says evacuation. This

01:48:21.795 --> 01:48:26.266
evacuation routes effective.

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:26.867
Are clearly marked are free of

01:48:26.933 --> 01:48:31.972
impediments. And even having in

01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:33.940
washing safer volcanoes. As you

01:48:34.007 --> 01:48:44.351
a mountaineers their. The

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:47.187
obvious choice for your like

01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:49.956
Leucadia and other parts of its

01:48:50.023 --> 01:48:50.523
a need just up and down the

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:53.793
coast. What used to be one of.

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:54.361
Nothing was state the state

01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:58.098
dropped no one is a highway.

01:48:58.164 --> 01:48:58.732
Because if anything happens and

01:48:58.798 --> 01:48:59.799
I five you have no back up.

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:02.102
Living in Washington where a

01:49:02.168 --> 01:49:04.137
truck damage to bridge for six

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:05.805
months. And they had to go on

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:06.439
ninety nine which is equivalent

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:10.076
up there. We don't have that

01:49:10.143 --> 01:49:12.512
back up. One on one would be

01:49:12.579 --> 01:49:14.681
the evacuation route strips

01:49:14.748 --> 01:49:16.850
gaping it's going to kill

01:49:16.917 --> 01:49:17.884
people. If you look at the

01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:18.451
paradise fire. When the main

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:22.923
says of death. According to the

01:49:22.989 --> 01:49:23.523
LA times poll. Is that they'd

01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:25.225
street scape the main. Have any

01:49:25.292 --> 01:49:27.861
out of the town. People are

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:29.863
trapped in their cars. We can't

01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:32.265
afford that here we need to be

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:34.100
respectful for everyone and not

01:49:34.167 --> 01:49:41.841
for the convenience of a few.

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:42.475
Thank you thank you so much you

01:49:42.542 --> 01:49:45.979
have two minutes. Good

01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:46.613
afternoon thank you so much for

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.181
hosting this a hearing was very

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:52.319
informative and Tara I know I

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:52.953
appreciate that my name sherry

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.955
mac and former council member

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:55.789
for the city of Oceanside

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:58.058
Oceanside resident in here

01:49:58.124 --> 01:50:03.596
today representing the citizens.

01:50:03.663 --> 01:50:05.899
Of the press parks and beaches

01:50:05.966 --> 01:50:06.499
something that is very dear to

01:50:06.566 --> 01:50:12.605
our. What I if at all possible

01:50:12.672 --> 01:50:13.206
I've been to several hearings

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:13.840
and if you're here it's great

01:50:13.907 --> 01:50:15.875
you can absorb the information.

01:50:15.942 --> 01:50:17.978
However if you're not here

01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:21.915
trying to track down. The data

01:50:21.982 --> 01:50:24.217
the power point presentations

01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:26.519
all that great information you

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:28.722
have to go to each agency and

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:29.255
Hutton pack what are the

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:30.223
possible that you could

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:32.025
consider having a link to all

01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:34.127
the information that present.

01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:35.862
Possibly on Facebook page so

01:50:35.929 --> 01:50:38.465
that'd make it easy for the

01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:39.966
public. Said just said it will

01:50:40.033 --> 01:50:42.168
be on my website awesome I

01:50:42.235 --> 01:50:50.777
thank you so much. Hello my

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:54.014
name my. Charlie McDermott

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:58.351
insists for. I want to raise

01:50:58.418 --> 01:50:58.918
two points of a start some

01:50:58.985 --> 01:51:00.186
macro points the drill down to

01:51:00.253 --> 01:51:02.322
something that's that's really

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:02.856
critical particularly for

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:04.024
Anthony this. No California's

01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:07.727
very blessed we have. Probably

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:09.929
mild climate compared to let's

01:51:09.996 --> 01:51:10.597
say New Hampshire we don't have

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:14.667
ice storms we don't have to re

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:15.201
pave the roads every three

01:51:15.268 --> 01:51:17.937
years- and we also have a

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:18.471
massive tax base to hear

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:22.108
there's no money the money

01:51:22.175 --> 01:51:22.709
there's no money the state has

01:51:22.776 --> 01:51:24.377
extremely high taxes. And

01:51:24.444 --> 01:51:26.546
there's potentially no

01:51:26.613 --> 01:51:27.914
meaningful infrastructure

01:51:27.981 --> 01:51:30.216
spending the state for near the

01:51:30.283 --> 01:51:33.686
century the greatest. Leucadia

01:51:33.753 --> 01:51:34.287
should not be flooding that's

01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:36.056
not sea level rise that's a

01:51:36.122 --> 01:51:38.425
rain storm and if you look at

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:40.527
the data that was presented

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:44.330
today. We haven't even headed

01:51:44.397 --> 01:51:44.964
to the point of significant sea

01:51:45.031 --> 01:51:46.232
level rise. We are just

01:51:46.299 --> 01:51:49.969
reaping. The seeds that we so

01:51:50.036 --> 01:51:52.172
inaction in maintaining

01:51:52.238 --> 01:51:52.739
reasonable infastructure for

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:54.441
first will country Nicaragua

01:51:54.507 --> 01:51:58.511
has better drainage to locate a.

01:51:58.578 --> 01:52:02.782
And I think the issue to me is

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:06.052
getting. Is caught up day to

01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:08.088
some of these very pressing

01:52:08.154 --> 01:52:10.156
issues. Which are very glad

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:11.791
that was shown that's coastal

01:52:11.858 --> 01:52:12.292
erosion that's a massive

01:52:12.358 --> 01:52:13.693
collapse at a public beach

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.929
where people and kids play in

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:16.496
senators didn't lose three

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:19.032
people at loss for people in

01:52:19.099 --> 01:52:22.569
the last ten years. And I live

01:52:22.635 --> 01:52:23.636
right in the KDE. That blood is

01:52:23.703 --> 01:52:26.539
full time I am shocked we four

01:52:26.606 --> 01:52:28.208
people have been killed. And

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:32.278
what I recommend is. You guys

01:52:32.345 --> 01:52:32.879
have to support these now you

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:34.247
have to at least I'll property

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:36.249
owners to support their

01:52:36.316 --> 01:52:42.222
property with homes. And see

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:46.226
walls and drainage. Or whatever

01:52:46.292 --> 01:52:46.826
it needs to be done instead of

01:52:46.893 --> 01:52:50.597
a tax. Threatening them having

01:52:50.663 --> 01:52:51.798
a life guard spying take

01:52:51.865 --> 01:52:52.365
pictures because you've been

01:52:52.432 --> 01:52:56.336
guided by. Rather. Problems

01:52:56.402 --> 01:52:56.970
playing box falling you killing

01:52:57.036 --> 01:52:58.805
people on the beach this is

01:52:58.872 --> 01:52:59.472
happening now and it's going to

01:52:59.539 --> 01:53:00.006
happen and I just went out

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:03.943
there yesterday I saw about

01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.544
five hundred pound chunk that

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:05.979
didn't come to wave action is

01:53:06.045 --> 01:53:06.579
because rainstorm and it fell

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:08.014
down so I recommend private

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:10.884
property owners be allowed to

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:17.390
responsibly manage their boss

01:53:17.457 --> 01:53:18.024
without being attacked is right

01:53:18.091 --> 01:53:19.626
now no one's touching anything.

01:53:19.692 --> 01:53:23.329
And I think the access points

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:23.930
do you think they should have

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:26.366
more action concert. Tragedy in

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:26.966
the light stamp right in front

01:53:27.033 --> 01:53:30.803
of the very small seat. This

01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:33.239
the safe. Going here he has put
