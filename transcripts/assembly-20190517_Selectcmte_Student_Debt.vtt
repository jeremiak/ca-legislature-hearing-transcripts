00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.951

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:20.579

BUT WHAT WHAT FELL ON THE FLOOR

00:11:48.674 --> 00:11:50.209
WHAT WON'T FIT IN THERE FLOW

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:51.944
CHARTS IN THEIR TEN POINT PLANS

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:52.511
TO ELIMINATE STUDENT DEBT.

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:53.979
IS THAT.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.015
VERY MUCH THAT SOME OF US IN

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:58.084
STUDENTS COME TO REALIZE IS THAT

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.985
LIFE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.154
PLANS CHARTS [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.989
OR PROMISES.

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:04.590
THESE ARE REALITIES WE LOOK

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:05.991
STUDENTS HAVE TO LIVE WITH.

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:08.394
I WISH I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.362
STRUGGLES WITH IMPENDING DAN AND

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.298
CERTAIN AND UNCERTAINTY OR

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:12.531
UNIQUE.

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.433
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT MY

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.302
STORY SOME OUT LIAR SOME ANOMALY.

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:19.972
BUT IT'S NOT.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.007
THE PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION ARE

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:22.308
EXHAUSTED.

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:24.143
FRUSTRATED [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.978
THEY'RE SCARED.

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:29.982
AND THEY'RE VERY BROKE.

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:30.649
I KNOW SOMEONE THAT THE STORE OF

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:32.051
HUMAN KNOWLEDGE DOUBLES EVERY

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:34.053
FIVE YEARS AND I'M SURE NOW THAT

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.055
STATISTIC IS PROBABLY WAY.

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.990
WAY MORE.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:38.624
AND WHAT THAT ADVANCING COMES A

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:40.326
JOB MARKET CROTHERS COMPETITION

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:42.194
WHICH MEANS LITTLE LESS

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:45.998
OPPORTUNITIES A LOT MORE WORK.

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:48.000
AND A BLEAKER FUTURE.

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:50.302
NOW I MEAN FOR THE RECORD I'M

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:52.037
NOT SAYING THAT MY GENERATION IS

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:54.039
AN UP FOR THE CHALLENGE --

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:58.010
CHOSEN MOUNTAIN WILL CLIMB IT.

00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:00.279
SHOWS THAT YOU BILL LIKE WHAT

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:01.981
YOU THINK OUR CAPACITY IS AND

00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:02.515
I'M PRETTY SURE WILL COME

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:06.018
FOUNDER EXPECTATIONS.

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:06.619
WE KNOW WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:08.187
HARD WE KNOW.

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.456
THAT WE HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO EARN

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:10.623
IT.

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.491
AND WE KNOW THAT THE JOURNEY IS

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:14.360
JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE END

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.995
RESULT.

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.997
BUT IT COULD BE A LITTLE EASIER.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:20.099
JUST A LITTLE EASIER.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.268
AND IN THAT TINY DIFFERENCES

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:24.003
WHAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:28.073
SO WHAT CAN YOU DO.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.707
I MEAN THE GOOD THE GOOD THING

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:29.241
IS THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.009

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:18.170
AND THE LOAN DEFAULT RATES CAN

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.072
INDICATE HOW WELL A UNIVERSITIES

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:21.907
HELPING STUDENTS ATTEND COLLEGE

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:22.508
WITHOUT RELYING TOO MUCH ON

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.109
LOANS.

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.011
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE UC

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:26.678
I STUDENTS HERE THE DEFAULT RATE

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:30.048
IS ONLY ONE POINT 7%.

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:30.616
IN THE NATIONAL RATE IS TEN

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.551
POINT EIGHT THIS IS AN INDICATOR

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:36.088
HOW WELL OUR STUDENTS ARE DOING

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:36.688
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:38.056
OVER BORROW.

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:38.690
AND THAT'S WHEN THEY GO INTO

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:40.192
PAYMENT THERE'S SUCCESSFUL IN

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.027
MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS THAT

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:44.062
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T DO

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:44.630
MORE OR SHOULD DO MORE WE

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:46.365
ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE WORKING

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:47.966
TOGETHER.

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.935
AND FINANCING AND EDUCATION

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:50.536
DEFINITELY TAKES A VILLAGE IT

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:52.337
TAKES THE STATE IT TAKES THE

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.106
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES THE

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:56.208
UNIVERSITY AND IT TAKES A FAMILY.

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:58.143
ALL OF US TOGETHER HAVE TO WORK

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.012
TOWARDS A SOLUTION TO HELP LOWER

00:18:00.078 --> 00:18:00.612

THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.218
FEDERAL STUDENT AID DOES

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.120
CONTINUE TO SHRINK WITHIN THE

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:10.189
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE SAW IT

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:12.157
FIRST WHEN THEY GRADUATE

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.992
STUDENTS LOST THEIR SUBSIDIES ON

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:14.326
THEIR LOANS.

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:16.028
WE SEE IT IN THE PROSPERITY ACTS

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:18.063
THAT IS GOING FORWARD IN THE

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.232
NATION THAT WILL REDUCE SCO JEEP

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.067

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.393
IT IS OVERWHELMING AND THAT'S

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:56.361

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:36.148
AND REPLACED WITH THIS BURDEN

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:38.216
PUT ON INDIVIDUALS TO FINANCE

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:40.152
THEIR EDUCATION THEMSELVES --

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:42.254
AND SO TO DATE FOUR HUNDRED

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.022
THOUSAND BORROWERS IN RURAL

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:44.656
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE STUDENT

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:46.424
DEBT. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.026
OLDER BORROWERS HAVE STUDENT

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:48.660
DEBT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:50.462
OLDER BORROWERS ARE ACTUALLY THE

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.130
FASTEST SEGMENT THAT'S A GROWING

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:52.631
SEGMENT OF STUDENT LOAN

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:56.234
BORROWERS -- 300-100-0500

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:56.868
THOUSAND BORROWERS ACROSS STATE

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.303
OF CALIFORNIA ARE NOW BEHIND ON

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.038
THEIR LOANS.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:02.507
WHAT THAT MEANS I THINK WITH THE

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.276
CHANGING FACE OF THE STUDENT

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:06.011
DEBT CRISIS AT LEAST MEANS TO US

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:06.645
IS THAT WE SHOULD CHALLENGE OUR

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:08.213
OUR PRIOR WE SHOULD?

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.315
THINK ABOUT THE CONVENTIONAL

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.250
WISDOM THAT LED US TO A TRILLION

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:12.851
AND A HALF DOLLARS WITH THE

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:14.486
STUDENT AT NATIONWIDE -- AND ASK

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:16.521
THE REALLY HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:18.390
HOW WE GOT HERE AND WHY AND AND

00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:20.492
WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE BARS THAT

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.260
ARE BOTH YOUNG AND OLD -- THAT

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:24.296
ARE URBAN AND RURAL THAT ARE

00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:26.031
BLACK AND WHITE THAT ARE THAT

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:26.598
ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO FOR

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:27.265
PROFIT COLLEGES AND PEOPLE THAT

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:30.068
GRADUATED IN THE UC SYSTEM -- IS

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:32.003
A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN JUST

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.005
A HANDFUL OF PREDATORY SCHOOLS

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:36.007
FOR A HANDFUL OF PREDATORY

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:38.109
LENDERS IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:38.710
AFFECTS COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:40.478
STATE -- WHICH IS I THINK PART

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:42.013
OF THE REASON WE'RE SO EXCITED

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.015
TO SEE THAT THE THE SELECT

00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:44.649
COMMITTEE WAS CREATED AND HEAR

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.051
FROM THAT.

00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:48.086
THE LARGE COLLECTION EXPERTS AND

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:50.255
INDIVIDUAL BORROWERS -- THAT ARE

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:52.190
ASSEMBLED HERE TODAY AND WHY.

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:54.192
SAULS OPENING REMARKS -- WE'RE

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:56.228
REALLY SO MOVING AND AND HIT

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:58.063
HOME IN SO MANY WAYS.

00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:04.135
WE THINK A LOT ABOUT THE BASIS

00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:04.603
TO DEBT CRISIS BEING.

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:06.238
AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GOING TO A

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:08.073
STATE SCHOOL.

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:10.041
WITH HELP FROM THEIR FAMILY.

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:10.642
AND THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:12.143
STUDENT IT LOOKS LIKE IN

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.014
CALIFORNIA OR IN AMERICA TODAY --

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:16.648
I THINK TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:20.185
HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE SOCIETAL

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:22.287
EFFECTS OF STUDENT AT THE

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:22.954
ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF STUDENT DEBT

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:24.522
THE REALLY BIG POLICY QUESTIONS

00:25:24.589 --> 00:25:28.059
THAT ARE GOING TO CONFRONT.

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:28.693
THE LEGISLATURE WHEN GRAPPLING

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.160
WITH THIS THIS REALLY

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:30.161
COMPLICATED ISSUE.

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:34.165
SO -- I WANT TO CLOSE WITH A

00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:36.101
MORAL QUESTIONS THAT -- WHEN YOU

00:25:38.136 --> 00:25:38.670
DO YOU THINK THIS IS RIGHT OR

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.472
WRONG -- AND IT IF YOU LIKE SO

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:42.507
MANY OTHER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THIS

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.075
IS WRONG.

00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:44.743
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.411
AND SO IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:48.380

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.330
KIND OF FRAME THE CONVERSATION

00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:40.165
AROUND AROUND THE LANDSCAPE OF

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:42.067
CALIFORNIA STUDENT.

I MEAN YEAH I'VE BEEN IN THE

00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:46.938
LIKE I SAID I'VE BEEN AROUND

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:47.572
FINANCIALLY FOR MANY YEARS AND

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:48.506
AND THERE DEFINITELY ARE SOME

00:26:48.573 --> 00:26:50.241
BAD ACTORS OUT THERE IS SUCH AS

00:26:50.308 --> 00:26:52.077
THE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS.

00:26:52.143 --> 00:26:54.079
I AND THAT DEFINITELY HAVE A

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:56.381
PRETTY TERRY -- TYPE OF LENDING

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.183
TACTICS THAT TIME.

00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:00.251
THEY TYPICALLY DON'T NEED

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:02.053
STUDENT TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT SO

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:02.721
THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY WORK

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:04.289
TO BE DONE WITHIN THE STATE OF

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:06.091
CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION.

00:27:06.157 --> 00:27:08.460
AND I I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW AND I

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:10.161
APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION IS THIS

00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:10.762
WRONG OR IS THIS RIGHT AND I

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.430
WOULD SAY A SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:14.366
FINANCIAL AID AND WORKS WITH

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:16.334
INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS AND AND SEES

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:20.171
THE STRUGGLE THAT IT TAKES. TO

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:22.173
AFFORD AN EDUCATION -- FOR

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.211
MYSELF AND I DON'T SEE A STUDENT

00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:28.279
LOAN AS PRO NOR CON I BELIEVE

00:27:28.346 --> 00:27:30.315
FINANCIAL AID INCLUDING SELF

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:32.183
HELP LOANS.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.319
AND ARE A TOOL AND I THINK AND

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.521
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:38.323
SOMETIMES STUDENTS NEED TO DO IN

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.125
ORDER TO AFFORD AN EDUCATION.

00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:42.293
NOW SHOULD STUDENTS BORROWED ALL

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.429
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN OFFERED YOU

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.197
KNOW SHOULD THEY DO TO THE

00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:46.798
BORROWED THE ENTIRE AMOUNT.

00:27:46.865 --> 00:27:48.600
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THEY SHOULD

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:50.301
BUT I THINK EVERY FAMILY NEEDS

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:52.070
TO MAKE THAT DECISION WHEN

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:52.570
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:54.139
AFFORDABILITY FACTOR.

00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:56.174
FIRST DO THE NEED THE STUDENT

00:27:56.241 --> 00:27:58.343
LOAN SOME REALLY DO NEED THAT

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.311
LAND AND SOWED RESTRICTING

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:02.180
ACCESS TO THAT COULD BE -- YOU

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.115
KNOW HAVE A LOT OF UNINTENDED

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.051
CONSEQUENCES WHERE WHERE WHERE

00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:06.651
PRICING OUT SOME OF OUR NEEDY

00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:08.219
STUDENTS THAT NEED ACCESS TO

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:10.355
SOME HELP ELF -- SELF HELP AID

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:14.259
SO -- I THINK WAY AND I AND I

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:16.261
BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IS THAT WE

00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:16.761
NEED TO BE EDUCATING OUR

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.396
STUDENTS BETTER TO BE MORE

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:20.331
DELIBERATE IN THEIR BARRING WHEN

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:20.865
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR

00:28:20.932 --> 00:28:22.200
FINANCIAL AID OFFERS.

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:24.369
AND THEY SHOULDN'T JUST ACCEPT

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:26.204
THE LANDS DOWN THE LINE OR

00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:28.139
ACCEPT ALL OF THEIR AID WITHOUT

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:28.740
EVEN LOOKING AT IT WE DO SEE

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.008
SENIORS THAT GRADUATE.

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:32.177
AND THEY HAD TO GO TO THE LOAN

00:28:32.243 --> 00:28:32.777
EXIT INTERVIEW AND THEY DON'T

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:34.279
REMEMBER BORROWING.

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:36.448
AND IT'S NOT AN UNCOMMON STORY

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:38.083
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME SO I

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.683
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:47.992
EDUCATION TO UNDERSTANDING.

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:50.028
AND INDEBTEDNESS AND SELF FOR

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:50.628
COLLEGE STUDENTS THIS IS THE

00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:51.963
VERY FIRST TIME THAT THEY'VE HAD

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:52.630
TO GO INTO LOANS THE FIRST TIME

00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:53.264
THEY'VE OFFERED CREDIT CARDS.

00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:54.432
I AM I THINK HIGH SCHOOLS COULD

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:54.999
DO A LOT TOWARDS TRYING TO

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:55.567
PROVIDE SOME OF THESE BASIC

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:56.401
FINANCE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:58.002
A LOAN MEAN.

00:28:58.069 --> 00:28:58.570
AND WHAT DOES RESPONSIBLE

00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:01.973
BARRING MEAN AND AND WHY CAREER

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.640
ARE YOU LOOKING AT AND WHAT DO

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:04.476
YOU THINK YOU CAN BE FORTY THREE

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.144
PAYMENT IN MAKING SURE YOU HAVE

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:06.377
LIMITS.

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:08.313
AND AND GOING FORWARD IN A VERY

00:29:08.379 --> 00:29:10.148
DELIBERATE WAY ALL OF THOSE

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:10.715
TYPES OF THINGS ARE REALLY

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:13.985
IMPORTANT -- WHEN GOING INTO A

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:18.022
STUDENT -- LEARN TO TUITION.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:20.358
IT IS ALWAYS MY DESIRE THAT

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:22.260
STUDENTS GRADUATE DEBT FREE AND

00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:24.262
I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE AND

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:28.133
WE CAN DO MORE -- AS A COMMUNITY

00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:30.068
I AM BUT I THINK WE HAVE A WAYS

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:30.668
TO GO THERE BUT I THINK THERE

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:32.036
ARE ARE TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:32.637
INSTANTLY LIKE THE CAL GRANT

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:34.506
REFORM FOR SUMMER THAT'S GOING

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:36.174
TO MAKE AN INTENT BY INSTANT

00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:38.009
IMPACT ON STUDENTS AFFORDABILITY.

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:39.978
AND THAT TRYING TO PRIME PROVIDE

00:29:40.044 --> 00:29:40.545
MORE EDUCATION TO OUR HIGH

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:42.347
SCHOOL STUDENTS BEFORE THEY

00:29:42.413 --> 00:29:46.017
ENTER COLLEGE.

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:46.651
AND SO AND I THINK WHEN WE LOOK

00:29:46.718 --> 00:29:50.421
AT THEY THE CONUNDRUM STUDENT AT

00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:52.290
I MEAN THERE THERE'S KIND OF

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:54.192
THREE PIECES THERE'S JUST THAT

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:56.394
THE COST THAT YOU KNOW THE PRICE

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.029
TAG ASSOCIATED.

00:29:58.096 --> 00:29:58.596
WITH THE THE DEGREE THEY'RE

00:29:58.663 --> 00:30:00.031
TRYING TO GET.

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:04.002
THERE IS THE AND IT AID PACKAGES

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:06.171
AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO HELP

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:06.771
PEOPLE PAY FOR THAT AND THEN

00:30:06.838 --> 00:30:08.373
THERE'S THE WAY THAT THE THE

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:10.441
LOAN IS STRUCTURED AND AND THE

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:12.277
RATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOAN.

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:14.412
I THINK YOU KNOW IT EVERY ASPECT

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:16.314
THERE'S AN ELEMENT AS AND YOU

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.316
KNOW I NEED FOR KIND OF

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:19.984
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL LITERACY

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:20.552
AND TRANSPARENCY SO PEOPLE

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:22.420
UNDERSTAND FOR EVERY PIECE OF

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.022
THAT EQUATION.

00:30:24.088 --> 00:30:24.689
AND I THINK BECAUSE I WANTED TO

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:26.157
GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON IS IS

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:28.092
KIND OF THAT THIRD PIECE WHICH

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:28.259
IS.

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:32.163
THE LOAN AND REPAYMENT STRUCTURE

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.597
IN JUST THE RIGHT.

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:36.034
BECAUSE THE THE AVERAGE.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.038
RATE OF A STUDENT LOANS SEEMS.

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:42.140
UNREASONABLY HIGH GIVEN.

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:44.075
THE TYPE OF LOAN THAT IT IS AND

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:48.046
THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOU KNOW.

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:48.646
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WHETHER

00:30:48.713 --> 00:30:50.248
IT'S IN A THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:50.848
YET WHETHER THROUGH THE STATE

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.016
GOVERNMENT OR THROUGH.

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.985
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDE

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:56.221
SOME MECHANISM -- YOU KNOW

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:56.821
SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT THAT

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:59.991
MORTGAGES ARE STRUCTURED SAID

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:00.525
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER.

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:02.260
LOWER TERMS WHAT ARE YOUR

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:04.462
THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE CAN DO THERE

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:04.829
I GUESS BOTH.

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:06.264
AT A FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT WE

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:08.333
SHOULD BE DOING THERE AND SECOND.

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.435
WHAT CAN WE DO IT A STATE LEVEL

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:12.370
IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR CURRENT

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:14.038
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION?

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:16.140
I'M I DEFINITELY AGREE I THINK

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:16.808
STUDENT LOANS ARE TOO HIGH AND I

00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:18.476
THINK WHEN I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.245
THE SHRINKING OF A FEDERAL

00:31:20.311 --> 00:31:22.280
STUDENT AID AND HAS A LOT TO DO

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:24.148
WITH THAT I THINK.

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:26.084
YOU KNOW IS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:26.751
THIS WAS SEVERAL YEARS BACK WHEN

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.419
GRADUATE STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:30.154
FOR SUBSIDIZED PLANS AND SAID

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:30.722
THEY DIDN'T HAVE INTEREST

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:32.023
BEARING.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.657
WHILE THEY'RE ATTENDING SCHOOL

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.259
NOW EVERY GRADUATE LOAN IS A IS

00:31:34.325 --> 00:31:35.994
AN INTEREST BEARING THAT'S AN

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.162
UNSAFE LOAN -- WHICH IS YOU KNOW

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:38.763
THE LOAN THAT WE ENCOURAGED.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.365
LEAST BECAUSE YOUR CURRENT

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:40.999
INTEREST WHILE YOU'RE ATTENDING

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:44.002
SCHOOL AS FAR AS A REPAYMENT

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:46.170
PLANS I AM I THINK THE INTEREST

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:48.206
RATE IS TOO HIGH AS WELL IT'S

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:50.174
SET EVERY JULY FIRST IT'S GONE

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:52.010
DOWN THIS NEXT YEAR SO IT'S

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:52.710
BELOW 5% IT WAS IT'S 5% NOW AND

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:54.245
HOW IT'S GONNA.

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:56.114
GO DOWN INTO THE 4% SO I THINK

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:56.614
IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT

00:31:56.681 --> 00:32:00.184
DIRECTION -- BUT I DO YOU KNOW

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:02.053
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT HAD A

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:02.754
SET INTEREST RATE ALONG LINES OF

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.289
THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT DID WHERE

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:06.257
YOU KNOW YOU CAN KEEP IT AT A

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:08.059
LOW RATE.

00:32:08.126 --> 00:32:08.693
AND CERTAINLY AND BE BE USING

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.328
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO PUT THE

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.330
SAVINGS FROM THAT YOU KNOW THE

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:12.597
GRADUATE.

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:14.299
I AM SUBSIDIES INTO BACK INTO

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:16.301
THE PROGRAM BUT THEY DID AND

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:18.136
THEY ENDED UP USING IT FOR K.

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:18.770
THROUGH TWELVE WHICH WAS VERY

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:20.305
DISAPPOINTING FROM THE FEDERAL

00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:22.040
GOVERNMENT AS WELL.

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:22.674
AND I THINK THE PROSPERITY ACT

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.509
IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY STUDENT

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.277
SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.179
TWO MEN CALLING AND THEIR

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:28.446
FEDERAL.

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.348
AND CONGRESS ABOUT IT CERTAINLY

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:34.018
AND BECAUSE IT IT REDUCES THE

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:36.087
AMOUNT -- AND GRANT FUNDING AND

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.056
AND WORK CITY FINDING.

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:40.024
AN I BELIEVE IN THE PROSPERITY

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:40.692
ACT YOU KNOW THIS CALL THIS ONE

00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:42.460
GRANT ONE LONE BUT I'VE HEARD

00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:44.162
THEM TALKING ABOUT EVEN TAKING

00:32:44.228 --> 00:32:46.030
THE SUBSIDY AWAY FROM THE

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:46.731
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AS WELL --

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:48.499
WHICH MEANS THEY'LL BE OCCURRING

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.268
THAT INTEREST WHILE THEY'RE

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:52.070
ATTENDING SCHOOL SO WEIRD YOU

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:52.704
KNOW THAT FEDERAL AID AND STOOD

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.272
NAY DEMONSTRATORS SUCH AS MYSELF

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:56.107
WE ADVOCATE VERY STRONGLY. TO

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:58.309
PROTECT -- YOU KNOW THE OUR

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.178
STUDENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:00.712
THEY'RE NOT BEING GOUGED

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.413
CERTAINLY WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.248
AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS AND I

00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:06.017
BELIEVE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.086
AND YOU KNOW SUCH AS THAT THE

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:08.686
BILL THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:10.321
REALLY DOES LIMIT OPPORTUNITY

00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:12.256
FOR THE NEEDIEST FAMILIES TO

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:18.096
COME IN.

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:18.663
WITH A LOOK AT LEVEL PLAYING

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.064
FIELD.

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:22.033
AND YOU KNOW I THINK I SAID

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.633
INTEREST RATE WOULD BE BETTER

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.234
BUT I THINK AND CERTAINLY THE

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.369
SHRINKING OF OVERALL THE FEDERAL

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:25.036
STUDENT AID IS VERY CONCERNING.

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:26.371
CONSIDERING THAT THE NATION IS

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:26.971
AN A STUDENT LOAN CRISIS IT'S

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.239
GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:32.043
STUDENTS WILL NEED TO BORROW.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.677
IF I COULD STOP FOR A A LITTLE

00:33:32.744 --> 00:33:34.512
BIT MORE ON THE ON THE BACK END

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.047
OF THE PROCESS SO.

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:38.082
ALL OF THOSE REFORMS ARE ARE

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:40.017
MEANINGFUL EFFORTS. TO BRING

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:42.086
DOWN THE NET PRICE OF COLLEGE OF

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:44.322
OUR HOURS AND CERTAINLY CAN DO

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.722
ALL THAT WORK.

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:46.357
THERE ARE FORTY FOUR MILLION

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:46.924
AMERICANS THAT HAVE STUDENT

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.226
LOANS WITH THE TERMS THAT EXIST

00:33:48.292 --> 00:33:50.027
RIGHT NOW -- AND THREE POINT

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:50.628
EIGHT MILLION OF THEM LIVE IN

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.330
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:52.930
THINGS LIKE -- BUT WITH THE

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.365
CHAIR DOES MENTION THE ABILITY

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:56.033
TO REFINANCE YOUR LOAN JUST LIKE

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.701
YOU DO WITH A MORTGAGE TO BRING

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:58.369
DOWN THE TOTAL COST OF YOUR DEBT.

00:33:58.436 --> 00:34:00.204
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:02.106
FIGURING OUT HOW TO SOLVE THE

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:04.208
PROBLEM CONFRONTING PEOPLE TO

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.077
HAVE STUDENT AT TODAY.

00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:06.711
A RIGHT NOW THOSE PRODUCTS ARE

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:08.012
LARGELY LIMITED TO THE MOST

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:08.679
CREDIT WORTHY BORROWERS -- THERE

00:34:08.746 --> 00:34:10.481
REALLY ISN'T A ROBUST RE FINANCE

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:12.150
MARKET THAT HELPS.

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:12.683
A TYPICAL STE MIDDLE CLASS

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.152
STUDENT LOAN.

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.120
BRING DOWN THEIR INTEREST RATES

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.022
THERE ARE FEDERAL PROGRAMS

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:18.556
DESIGNED TO MAKE PAYMENTS

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:20.291
AFFORDABLE -- INCOME DRIVEN

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:22.026
REPAYMENT IS A NEAR UNIVERSAL

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:22.627
RITE FOR EVERYONE HAS FEDERAL

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.128
STUDENT LOAN.

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:24.762
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING -- THERE

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:26.464
WERE A MILLION DEFAULTS LAST

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.332
YEAR AND MILLION DEFAULTS THE

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.168
YEAR BEFORE THAT AND MILLION

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:30.768
DEFAULTS THE YEAR BEFORE THAT

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:32.503
AND A HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIA

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.104
BORROWERS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:34.338
LIVES TODAY -- DESPITE THIS

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.274
RIGHT TO MAKE A PAYMENT BASED ON

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:36.607
YOUR INCOME.

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:38.242
AND IF YOU'RE VERY LOW INCOME OR

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:40.144
YOU JUST LOST YOUR JOB YOUR

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:40.778
PAYMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS IS

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:42.380
ZERO DOLLARS A MONTH AND SO --

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:44.148
AS THIS COMMITTEE THINKS ABOUT

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:46.083
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PROBLEM I

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.152
WOULD ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA ALSO

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.188
THINK ABOUT BILLS LIKE. EIGHTY

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:50.788
THREE SEVENTY SIX THAT FOCUSES

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:52.623
ON DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.093
THE COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.062
IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS.

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:00.164
AND MAKING SURE THAT STUDENT

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:00.698
LOAN DEFAULT ISN'T LIKE A

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:01.365
NECESSARY FEATURE OF THE STUDENT

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:02.333
LOAN MARKET. FOR THE TENS OF

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.070
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE.

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:06.737
TO I I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THE

00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:10.074
INCOME SINCE THE PLAN DOES NOT.

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:10.608
WORK AS WELL AS IT SHOULD

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.109
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:14.111
QUALIFY FOR A ZERO PAYMENT PER

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:14.712
MONTH YOU ARE STILL ACCRUING

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:16.414
INTEREST DURING THAT TIME OF

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:18.282
THAT YOU'RE NOT IN YOU KNOW

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:20.184
PAYING A MONTHLY PAYMENT AND

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:20.685
SAID THAT INTERESTS IS

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:22.086
COMPOUNDING.

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:22.787
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.388
INCOMES AND STEP PLAN WHEN

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:26.090
YOU'RE YOU KNOW.

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:26.657
HOW THAT DEFERMENT ON YOUR

00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:28.159
PAYMENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:30.228
THE MONEY TO PAY THAT THAT THEY

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:32.296

OVERALL INDEBTEDNESS INCREASES

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:44.709
BECAUSE THE INTERESTING CREWS

EXPECTATIONS I WOULD BE GOING TO

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:08.019

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:10.388
BOTH OF MY PARENTS HAD NEVER

BEEN THEMSELVES NONE THE LESS

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:12.657
THEY MOTIVATED AND ENCOURAGED ME

00:38:12.723 --> 00:38:14.025
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS.

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:16.427
IN HIGH SCHOOL I FOLLOW THE

00:38:16.494 --> 00:38:16.994
COOKIE CUTTER ROAD MAP TO

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:18.329
COLLEGE I WAS A STRAIGHT A

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:20.064
STUDENT WHO PARTICIPATED IN

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:22.033
SEVERAL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS.

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:24.201
HAD AN INTERNSHIP AND VOLUNTEER

00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:24.502
EXPERIENCE.

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:26.437
I EVEN JOINED ALVIN ON MY CAMPUS

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.205
WHICH IS A PROGRAM DEDICATED TO

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:28.739
GIVING STUDENTS BOTH THE

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.307
EMPOWERMENT AND TOOLS THEY NEED

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:32.343
TO APPLY PREPARE FOR A HIGHER

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:32.643
EDUCATION.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.412
I HAD DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT TO

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.013
GET ACCEPTED INTO COLLEGE.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:36.614
BUT THIS DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:40.017
SIGNIFICANCE OF STICKER SHOCK.

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:40.618
I STILL REMEMBER SEEN AT HOME

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:42.019
WITH MY DAD.

00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.988
GREEN IN THE CHART OF COLLEGES

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:44.522
THAT I HAD BEEN ACCEPTED.

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.223
TO THIS CHART INCLUDED THE

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.992
ESTIMATED COST OF ATTENDING THE

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:48.559
UNIVERSITY AND MY ESTIMATED

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:50.027
FINANCIAL AID.

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:52.296
THERE IS NO WAY FOR OP ED OR ANY

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:53.998
PROGRAM TO PREPARE AN AMBITIOUS

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:54.632
STUDENT FOR THE HARSH REALITIES

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:56.033
OF THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.369
ULTIMATELY I CHOSE TO ATTEND CAL

00:38:58.436 --> 00:39:00.004
STATE FULLERTON FOR A PLETHORA

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:01.972
OF REASONS BUT THE MAIN DECIDING

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:03.974
FACTOR WAS ITS AFFORDABILITY

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:04.575
COMPARED SISTER INSTITUTIONS.

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.377
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I WAS FACED

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:08.179
WITH THE DECISION OF WHETHER OR

00:39:08.245 --> 00:39:10.014
NOT TO TAKE OUT STUDENT LOANS.

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:10.681
EVEN SAYING THAT SOUNDS SILLY TO

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:12.016
ME AS IF IT WAS EVER DECISION.

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:14.318
FOR ME AND COUNTLESS OTHER

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:15.986
STUDENTS LOANS WERE NEVER

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:16.620
DECISION BUT RATHER REQUIREMENT

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.022
TO OBTAIN A HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:20.291
THIS UP DESPITE RECEIVING A PELL

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:22.126
GRANT A CAL GRANT WORKING TWO TO

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:22.727
THREE JOBS I HAVE TO TAKE OUT

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:24.328
STUDENT LOANS IN ORDER TO AFFORD

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.097
NECESSITIES LIKE RENT BOOKS

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:28.032
GROCERIES AND MORE.

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:28.699
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE ANY

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.167
OTHER OPTIONS ARE SUPPORT.

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:32.103
THERE IS NO MANUAL OF WHAT TO DO

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:32.770
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:34.038
FOR COLLEGE.

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:34.672
THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.107
WHEN YOU'RE FINANCIALLY IT STILL

00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:36.640
DOESN'T COVER YOUR COST OF

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.042
ATTENDANCE.

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.676
I TOOK OUT THE ONES BECAUSE IT

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:40.044
WAS NECESSARY.

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:41.979
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW AND PROBABLY

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:42.646
STILL NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:44.014
WHAT I SIGNED UP.

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:46.016
FOR FINANCIALLY THIS COMPLEX.

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.152
YES TYPES OF LOANS INTEREST

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.987
RATES DEFERMENT PLANS AND SO ON

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:51.989
I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY GUIDANCE

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:52.490
AND WHAT'S THE BEST.

00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:54.091
LOANS ARE PAYMENT PLANS ARE.

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:54.692
I JUST KNEW THAT I NEEDED THE

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:58.028
MONEY.

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:58.729
MANY STUDENTS IN THE CSU AS WELL

00:39:58.796 --> 00:40:00.364
AS THE UC AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.233
SYSTEMS HAVE THEIR TUITION FULLY

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:02.767
COVERED BY FINANCIALLY.

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.268
THE STUDENTS ARE STILL STUCK

00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:06.036
WITH EXTRAORDINARY UNMET NEEDS.

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:08.072
WITH THE FULL TRUE COST OF

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:10.141
ATTENDANCE OFTEN EXCEEDED TWENTY

00:40:10.207 --> 00:40:10.741
SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:12.510
LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN THE CSU

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:14.411
ARE LEFT TO COVER NEARLY FIFTEEN

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:16.046
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:18.015
OF A GAP THAT THEIR FINANCIALLY

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:20.050
DOES NOT OFFSET.

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:20.718
IT'S EASY TO PROCESS OFTEN CLAIM

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.386
THAT STUDENT SHOULD SIMPLY GET A

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.021
JOB OR PAY FOR THIS JOB.

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.990
THIS BACK IN MY DAY BACK IN MY

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:26.590
DAY MINDSET THAT STUDENTS CAN

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:28.325
STILL WORK PART TIME TO AFFORD

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:30.294
AN EDUCATION IS SOMETHING I'VE

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:30.694
HEARD FREQUENTLY.

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:32.396
HOWEVER SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:34.198
NINE TUITION AND FEES IN THE CSU

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:34.465
REST BY.

A 1000310060%.

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:38.736
DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD FOOD

AND HOUSING RELATED EXPENSES

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:42.039
ALSO INCREASED BY 40%.

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.275
THE COST OF COLLEGE IS

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:44.775
DRASTICALLY INCREASE OUR

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:48.045
GENERATIONS.

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:50.514
I AM ONE OF MANY STUDENTS WHO

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.148
ARE WORKING TO AN OUTSIDE THREE

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:51.782
JOBS IN ORDER TO A FOR THE COST

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:52.116
OF A DEGREE.

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:52.750
WE DO THIS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:54.218
BEING FULL TIME STUDENTS.

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.387
WERE ALSO INVOLVED BOTH ON AND

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:58.055
OFF CAMPUS.

00:40:58.122 --> 00:40:58.722
I'M STILL A STUDENT TRYING TO TO

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:00.057
DO ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:02.259
AS I MENTIONED I'M WORKING TWO

00:41:02.326 --> 00:41:04.461
JOBS I MEAN HOLDEN SIX CROSSES.

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:06.330
I'M INVOLVED IN STUDENT

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:06.897
GOVERNMENT WHERE I CURRENTLY

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:07.998
SERVE AS THE CHIEF GOVERNMENTAL

STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:41:12.102 --> 00:41:14.238
HOWEVER THERE'S NOT ONE SINGULAR

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:18.042
MODEL SUCCESS IN COLLEGE.

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:18.676
ITS SUCCESS WORKING ENOUGH TO

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:40.064

ADDITIONALLY IN ORDER TO AFFORD

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:50.574
THE HIGH COST OF LIVING ON

CAMPUS MY FRESHMAN YEAR.

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:51.709
I TOOK OUT A PRIVATE STUDENT

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:52.042

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.610
ALTOGETHER THIS ADDS UP TO A

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.311
GRAND TOTAL OF 210-005-0020 ONE

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:54.979
DOLLARS AND I'M ONLY IN MY THIRD

00:41:55.045 --> 00:41:56.046
YEAR OF COLLEGE.

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:58.048
I WILL HAVE TO PAY THESE BACK.

00:41:58.115 --> 00:42:00.050
AFTER GRADUATION WITH INTEREST.

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:00.718
THE PRIVATE ONE HOBBY NEARLY 11%

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:04.054
INTEREST RATE.

00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:06.123
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE LOANS

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.824
LAST BEYOND OUR TIME IN COLLEGE.

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.225
I'LL BE TAKING YEARS POST

AND TO BE HONEST I STILL HAVE NO

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:14.064
IDEA WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE.

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:14.632
WHY MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:16.066
THEM OFF?

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.269
WHY BE ELIGIBLE FOR POTENTIAL

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.137
LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS WHAT

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.039
HAPPENS IF I CAN'T PAY THEM OFF?

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:24.108
I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THESE

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:26.010
QUESTIONS FOR TOMORROW BECAUSE

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:26.610
I'M BUSY WORRIED ABOUT HOW TO

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:27.244
MAKE AND IT'S HOW TO MAKE ENDS

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:30.047
MEET TODAY.

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:30.447
THESE BURDENS ARE

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:31.081
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING LOW

00:42:31.148 --> 00:42:32.349
INCOME STUDENTS TO THESE

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.351
INSTITUTION INSTITUTIONS CLAIM

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:36.053
THEY SERVE.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.255
I THINK A LOT ABOUT THREE ALMOST

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:38.923
FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS TRYING

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:40.424
TO DECIDE WHERE TO GO TO COLLEGE

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.293
MY DECISION WAS ARE LARGELY

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:44.061
SWAYED BY MONEY.

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:44.561
DESPITE MY AMBITIONS AND

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:46.063
ABILITIES.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.697
DESPITE THE FACT THAT I CHOSE

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:48.265
THE MORE AFFORDABLE OPTION.

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:50.034
I AM STILL STUCK IN STUDENT

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:50.668
LOANS AND STRUGGLE TO BALANCE

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:52.102
BEING A FULL TIME STUDENTS WHO

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.071
STUDENT WHO WORKS SEVERAL JOBS.

00:42:54.138 --> 00:42:56.040
STUDENTS SHOULD I HAVE TO MAKE

00:42:56.106 --> 00:42:56.674
SACRIFICES AND TAKE ON MY PHONE

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.043
BURDENS TO OBTAIN SOMETHING NOW

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:00.144
MORE NECESSARY.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.079
THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ITS

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:04.181
BENEFITS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:04.848
ANYONE WILLING TO LEARN AND WORK

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:05.049
HARD.

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:06.250
NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:06.850
PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO HELP THE

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:08.052
MEANS.

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:08.652
TOGETHER WE NEED TO FIND THE

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:10.254
ADDRESS THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:10.821
LIKE MANY TO COMPREHENSIVE

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.122
FINANCIALLY REFORM.

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:14.491
UNLESS YOU PROVIDE STUDENTS LIKE

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.193
ME WITH THE RESOURCES NECESSARY

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.062
TO SIMPLY SURVIVE COLLEGE THAT.

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:22.066
THIS CRISIS WILL ONLY WORSEN.

FOR YOU FOR SHARING YOUR

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:36.146
PERSPECTIVE AND DAN.

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:38.082
I THINK ONE THING.

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:38.749
IT'S ALWAYS EASY FOR IT'S EASY

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:40.417
FOR THE STORIES GET LOST WHEN WE

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:42.052
SAY THINGS LIKE.

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:44.388
WE'VE GOT THREE POINT SEVEN

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:46.156

IN DEBT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:52.129
PEOPLE DEFAULTING IT.

00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:54.031
SOUNDS SCARY AND MASSIVE BUT

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:54.698
IT'S SO SO IMPORTANT I THINK FOR

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:58.335
US. TO BE ABLE TO PUT A PERSONAL

00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:02.306
ON A HUMAN FACE ON IT.

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:02.873
I THINK THAT'S WHAT REALLY

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.308
GALVANIZES POLICYMAKERS.

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.176

SOLUTIONS TO ALLEVIATE HAVING

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:56.193
STUDENT DEBT BURDENS THAT TOO

MANY CALIFORNIANS KERRY. TO

ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND IT'S

00:44:58.796 --> 00:45:00.397
REALLY ABOUT REQUIRE AND SEVERAL

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:02.232
OTHERS HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.040
WITHOUT HAVING TO BORROW WORK

00:45:10.107 --> 00:45:16.146
EXCESSIVELY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:18.348
DECADE TAKEN THINGS HAVE SHOWN

00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:20.050
THAT DESPITE THE LONG STANDING

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:20.551
FOCUS ON LOW TUITION AND

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:22.453
GENEROUS FINANCIAL PROGRAMS THAT

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:24.154
COVER TUITION.

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:24.755
REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:26.356
COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IN

COLLEGE. TO SUCCEED IF WE CANNOT

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:36.200
AFFORD THE COST BEYOND IT.

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:38.068
INCLUDING GAS TO GET TO CAMPUS

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:40.304
TEXT BOOKS FOR COURSE WORK IN A

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.106
SAFE PLACE TO LIVE.

00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:42.706
FREQUENTLY BORROWING LOANS TO

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:44.341
FILL THE GAP ON AFFORDABLE

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.410
COLLEGE COSTS ARE KEY DRIVERS OF

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.145
STUDENT DEBT.

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:50.247
I WAS SHOWN THE CALIFORNIANS

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:52.249
WITH INCOMES UNDER THIRTY

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:52.816
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WALDRON

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:54.451
PUBLIC COLLEGES HAVE TO SPEND

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:56.253
ABOUT HALF OR MORE OF THEIR

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.957
INCOME. TO COVER COLLEGE COSTS

00:46:00.023 --> 00:46:02.092
AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR GRANT AID.

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:02.726
WHAT IS NOT EASILY AFFORDABLE

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:04.394
FOR MANY STUDENTS THESE DAYS THE

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:06.330
SHARES OF INCOME EXPECTED FROM

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:08.031
THESE LOW INCOME STUDENTS IS

00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:10.134
MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SHARE IS

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.336
NEEDED FROM ANY OTHER INCOME

00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:14.004

00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:16.173
ANALYSIS FOUNDED IN REGIONS

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:16.773

COLLEGE WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:20.477
PUBLIC COLLEGE OPTION FOR

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:21.979

LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:26.016
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:26.550
IN OTHER WORDS THE LOWEST

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.185
MISSION COLLEGE IS NOT THE

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:30.454
LOWEST COST COLLEGE FOR STUDENTS.

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.356
THAT IS BECAUSE NINE TUITION

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:34.091
COLLEGE COSTS MAKE UP THE

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:36.059
MAJORITY OF TOTAL COSTS THAT

COLLEGES RECEIVE FAR LESS

THESE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:20.437
CHALLENGES ALSO RAISE

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.239
SUBSTANTIAL EQUITY CONCERNS WHEN

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:24.208
IT COMES TO BOTH STUDENT DEBT

00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:28.011
BURDENS AND COLLEGE COMPLETION.

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:28.545
FOR OVER A DECADE WE HAVE

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:30.080
TRACKED THE RATE AT WHICH

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:38.608
THIRTY WE SEE THIS HARMFUL

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:39.109
TRENDS BECAUSE TOO MANY

00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:40.344
CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING LEFT OUT

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:44.614
TOO LITTLE OF IT.

00:49:44.681 --> 00:49:46.383

AND FOR THOSE WHO DO RECEIVE A

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:06.870
GRANT.

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.438
THE VALUE OF THE ACCESS AWARD

00:50:08.505 --> 00:50:10.006
THAT HELP STUDENTS PAY FOR NON

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:12.008

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:12.576
ONE QUARTER OF ITS ORIGINAL

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:14.044
VALUE.

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:14.745
THAT IS WHY WE GET MORE THAN TWO

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:16.446
DOZEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:18.315
BEEN CALLING FOR INCREASES TO

AID THAT STUDENTS GOT TO COVER

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:24.287
NON TUITION COSTS. TO BEAR SOME

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:26.123
RESEMBLANCE TO THE COST THEIR

INCURRING AND THE ABILITY TO PAY

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:28.692
FOR THEM.

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:30.360
AT THIS POINT THERE IS A STRONG

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:32.229
CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:32.763
THIS COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:34.464
CRISIS REFLECTED IN LEGISLATIVE

00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:38.135
PROPOSALS. TO REFORM STATE

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:38.802

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:42.739
THROUGH COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:44.374
ADVOCATES AGREE THAT THE STATE

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:46.376

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:46.610

00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:48.245
AND EXPECTED STUDENTS AND

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:50.013
FAMILIES WOULD MAKE FINANCIAL

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:50.514
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.048
REASONABLE.

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:52.682
THE REST WOULD BE COVERED BY

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:54.384
FEDERAL COLLEGE IN AND STATE

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.486
GRANT EIGHT AB THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

PROVIDING A DEBT FREE CAN'T PATH

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:08.064

CURRENT BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.369
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:14.404
STRIDES ON THE AVAILABILITY

SUCH IMMEDIATE INVESTMENTS

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:30.287
PROPERLY TARGETED WOULD MAKE AN

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:30.887
IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE IN THE

00:51:30.954 --> 00:51:34.024

HE GETS IN OUR COALITION

00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:38.662
RECOMMEND THAT NEW INVESTMENTS

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:40.430
BE SPENT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER

00:51:40.497 --> 00:51:42.165

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.751
BECAUSE THE BURDEN WAS JUST TOO

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.052
TOO MUCH.

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:58.454
I WAS DIRECTED TO A COLLECTION

01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:00.056

OUT OF DEFAULT.

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:14.370
HOPEFULLY IF EVERYTHING I'VE

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.105
BEEN TOLD IS TRUE BUT SHOULD BE

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:16.706

BY THIS TIME NEXT MONTH.

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.078
WHAT THE MORAL OF THE STORY?

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:24.080
IS THAT ACQUIRING AN EDUCATION.

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:26.082
SHOULD NOT BE THIS DIFFICULT.

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:28.117
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ROAD IS

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.086
IS IS LONG AND HARD.

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:32.055
AND AND SALAS SAID YOU KNOW WE

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.090

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.225
HOWEVER I JUST TURNED THIRTY IN

FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR AND

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.394
ECONOMICALLY I AM BEHIND MANY OF

01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:40.063
MY PEERS.

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:40.663
SIMPLY BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:44.100
ADEQUATE FUNDS OR KNOWLEDGE TO

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.035

RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.438
EVEN NOW MY ABILITY TO MOVE

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:50.239

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.141
ON OVER NINE YEARS AGO.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.077
IS IN JEOPARDY.

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:56.145
AS A RESULT OF THIS DEFICIENCY.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:58.214
I KNOW THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.283

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:02.085

BECAUSE I JUST CAME BACK FROM

ARE BROKEN.

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:08.484
AND I THINK.

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:10.119
THERE THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.188

TO DID YOU RECEIVE A FINANCIAL

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:20.156

THAT YOU'RE ABLE.

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:30.299
TO LOOK AT A RADIO. FOR ME IT

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.268
WAS ON OUR LIKE STUDENT PORTAL

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:32.902

GRANT EXPANSION THAT THAT WE'RE

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:54.930
TALKING ABOUT THE ONE THING I I

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.298
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS IS JUST HOW

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:58.067
POWERFUL STUDENT ADVOCACY I

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.069
THINK HAS BEEN ON THAT ISSUE.

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:00.503
I'VE HAD STUDENTS.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:02.304

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.116
DIFFERENCE AND I THINK THAT.

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:14.583
IT WE ALL KNOW THAT.

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:18.053
POLITICIANS LISTEN.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:18.554

NO ONE PERSPECTIVE I HAVE IS I

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:26.762
THINK ONE REASON THAT THIS ISSUE

BECAUSE STUDENTS AREN'T ALWAYS

WHO PUTS HIS LIFE ON THE LINE

01:12:56.638 --> 01:13:02.311
EVERY DAY -- I'LL GET TO WHY IT

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:06.115
WAS SO EMOTIONAL BUT TELL YOU

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:06.782
ABOUT MY LIFE -- HE ISN'T ONE OF

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:08.250
THE MOST CRIME RIDDEN

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:10.119
NEIGHBORHOODS IN LOS ANGELES SO

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:12.154
HE'S ALSO A PUBLIC SERVICE.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:12.755
I'VE FOUGHT REALLY HARD FROM

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:14.089
EDUCATION.

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:16.125
I GRADUATED FROM USC AND HAVE

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:18.127
DEDICATED MY ENTIRE CAREER TO

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:18.494
PUBLIC SERVICE.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.562
I WORK FOR THE VETERANS AFFAIRS

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:22.431
DEPARTMENT AND IT WAS MY FIRST

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:24.266
JOB OUT OF COLLEGE AND HAVE BEEN

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:26.101
THERE FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS.

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:28.270
I'M LEADING THE TEAM TODAY THE

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.205
DATA CAN START TIME TO INSURANCE

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:32.141
VETERANS RECEIVE THE SERVICES

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:34.009
THEY HAVE.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.111
THAT THEY ARE DESERVING OF IT

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:36.779
WAS REALLY CLEAR TO ME THAT FOR

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:38.313
ME TO BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.115
I WOULD NEED SIGNIFICANT

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:42.017
FINANCIAL HELP.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.286
SO LOANS BECAME A REALLY

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:46.088
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:48.290
AND THEY DO NOT THINK ANYTHING

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:48.724
OF IT AT THE TIME.

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.392
IN FACT EVERYONE I KNEW WAS

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.127
ALREADY DOING IT AND EVERY

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:54.196
FINANCIAL OFFICER EXPO TWO OR

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.498
ALL OF THE BOOKS THAT WERE ON

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.167
THE CAMPUS OF UC SB WEREN'T

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:00.269
COURAGE IN YOUR TO TAKE.

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:00.569
LOANS SO.

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:04.106
I DID A AYE I WAS NEVER WARNED

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:04.606
HIM AND TOOK THAT AS A

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:08.277
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DEBT TO

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:10.012
GET FOR YOU AND SEE.

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:10.612
BEFORE I HAD EVEN HAD A CREDIT

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.147
CARD TO MY NAME.

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.516
SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I WAS

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.151
HIRED AS A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE.

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:16.852
ENTER MY RESEARCH OF MAKING THAT

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.453
DECISION I REALIZE THAT THERE

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.355
WAS A PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:22.024
FORGIVENESS PROGRAM.

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:22.691
AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO HEAR

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.159
THAT I CAN.

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:26.261
GET THROUGH THAT BY DEDICATING

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:30.098
MY TIME TO PUBLIC SERVICE.

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:30.732
THE CONTACTED MY SERVICE ARE AT

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:31.033
THE TIME.

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:32.301
AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT I

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:32.901
SHOULD I WOULD INDEED IN FACT

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.169
QUALIFIER HAD.

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.238
SIGNED UP TO THE PAYMENT PLAN

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.440
AND AND I SHOULD JUST KEEP GOING

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:40.509
AND THEN AFTER HUNDRED TWENTY

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:42.110
PAYMENTS IF YOU FIND.

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:44.246
SO I CONTINUE TO MAKE THOSE

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.114
PAYMENTS ON ABOUT PAYMENT PLAN.

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:48.383
AND I REMEMBER I HAVE RELEASED

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:48.951
DISTINCT PICTURE MY MIND A

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.519
LOGGING ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.254
EDUCATION WEBSITE IN TWO

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.089
THOUSAND AND EIGHT A YEAR AFTER

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:58.160
P. SLF HAD COME INTO EFFECT --

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:58.727
HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED IN FACT.

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.462
AND I SAW FIVE PAYMENTS FIVE

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:02.464
QUALIFYING TOWARD A HUNDRED AND

01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:04.166
TWENTY PAYMENTS.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.134
I'M ON TRACK -- EXCEPT I'M JUST

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:06.668

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:08.170
PAYMENTS [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:10.005
SO.

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:14.076
HOWEVER MY LONG KEPT GETTING

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:14.643
MOVED AROUND TO DIFFERENT

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.912
SERVICERS I DO UNDERSTAND WHY IT

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:18.347
DIDN'T BUT I JUST COULD LOG ON

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:20.382
TO THE DIFFERENT WEBSITES WITH

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.017
THE THEME OF CANCER.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:24.586
AND WHEN I LOG ON TO THOSE --

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.121
FINALLY IN.

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:26.655
TWENTY FOURTEEN MY CURRENT

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:29.992
SERVICER GOT A HOLD OF MY LOAN

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:32.160
MY FED LOAN SERVICERS.

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:32.661
MY FRIEND ON SERVICING.

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.596
AND I CONTACTED THEM JUST AS I

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:36.031
HAD ALL THE OTHER SERVICERS.

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.033
AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.269
I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT MY

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:40.903
PROGRESS WEST AS FAR AS BUT P.

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:46.074
SLF -- I HAVE BEEN MAKING ON

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:46.708
TIME PAYMENTS FOR THE LAST SIX

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:48.010
YEARS AS A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE.

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:50.145
AND I WAS DEVASTATED TO HEAR.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:53.982
THAT I DO NOT QUALIFY BUT I HAD

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:54.616
ZERO PAYMENTS MADE TOWARDS MY

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:56.018
HUNDRED TWENTY PAYMENTS.

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:58.220
AND THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE I WAS

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:02.024
UNDER THE WRONG.

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.426
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS PAYMENT

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.261
HOW WOULD DERAIL MY LOAN

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:06.929
FORGIVENESS POUNDS I CHOSE THIS

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.463
TIME WHEN I FIRST GRADUATED THE

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:10.065
SERVICES HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.034
INFORM ME THAT THIS POWER.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.069
TAKE THAT OPTION AWAY AND

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:16.038
EFFECTIVE TOLD ME DIFFERENTLY.

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:18.040
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ON TRACK.

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:20.242
SO I CONTINUED TO MAKE THOSE

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:20.776
PAYMENTS AND I EVEN MADE

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.311
PAYMENTS HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.413
DO SO THAT I CAN GET OUT OF THE

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:26.014
STAFF FASTER.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:28.150
NO ONE IS SURE MY CLIFF NOTES ON

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:29.985
MY CURRENT JOURNEY IT DOES NOT

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:31.987
REFLECT THE NEARLY THIRTY HOURS

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:32.621
I HAVE SPENT ON THE PHONE WITH

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:34.022
STAFF.

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:36.024
AND SUPERVISORS AFFECT LOAN.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:36.591
JUST TO TRY UNDERSTAND AND

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.393
EDUCATE THE SERVICER THAT IS

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:42.230
SUPPOSED TO SHARE WITH ME WHAT

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.266
MY OPTIONS ARE. TO CONTINUE TO

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:44.499
FIGHT.

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:46.201
I DO FEEL THAT THIS IS BIGGER

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.070
THAN ME I REPRESENT FRIENDS AT

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:50.138
UCSB IN SANTA BARBARA I DON'T

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:50.672
TAKE THIS FIGHT LIGHTLY.

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:52.541
AND I NEED TO EDUCATE MYSELF AND

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:56.044
MY FRIENDS AND MY CHILDREN.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.246
TO STAND UP THERE ARE DIFFERENT

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:00.215
WAYS TO GET THROUGH [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.050
LAST YEAR.

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:04.019
I HEARD THE NEWS.

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.188
THAT CONGRESS PASSED THE

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:06.488

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:08.223
UP PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.192
FORGIVENESS PROGRAM THAT WOULD

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:12.060
ALLOW CANDIDATES JUST EXACTLY OF

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:12.661
MYSELF TO QUALIFY FOR A LOAN

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.296
FORGIVENESS IF I MET CERTAIN

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.231

REPAYMENT PLAN I WAS AN AND I

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:20.035
MET THEM.

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:22.037
AT LEAST I THOUGHT.

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:22.637
A CONTACT THE FINAL SERVICING

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:24.039

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:26.041
THE PROGRAM DID NOT EXIST.

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:28.276
AND THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:30.045
RESOURCES.

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:32.047
NATURALLY I DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM.

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:34.383
SO I JUST WASN'T GOING TO GIVE

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:36.051

THEY TOLD ME THAT IT HAD PASSED

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:44.026

INSTRUCTOR COMMUNICATION MADE IT

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:26.326
CLEAR THAT ENGLISH WAS NOT THEIR

01:44:26.393 --> 01:44:28.462
PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND A LOT OF

01:44:28.528 --> 01:44:30.263
CASES.

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:30.897
CONSTANT REQUESTS FROM STUDENTS

01:44:30.964 --> 01:44:32.265
FOR THE INSTRUCTOR TO REPEAT.

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:36.570
WHAT HE SAID -- MET WITH SCORN

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:38.238

SO -- THE WEST PERSONNEL.

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.623
ASKED IF THEY COULD DO BETTER

01:44:56.690 --> 01:45:00.460
AND THEN ITT TECH -- OF COURSE

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:02.262
WE WERE ASSURED THAT THEY COULD.

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:04.231
WE WERE AGAIN GIVEN A SPIEL

01:45:04.297 --> 01:45:06.166
ABOUT THE SKILLS OF TOMORROW.

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:08.568
WHICH AT THE END OF MY EDUCATION

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:10.504
WOULD TRANSLATE INTO AN OFFER

01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:12.606
FOR A MINIMUM WAGE JOB OFFERING

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:14.608
A WHOLE LOT LESS THAN WHAT I WAS

CURRENTLY MAKING IS A SATELLITE

DISH INSTALLER.

01:45:18.311 --> 01:45:20.580

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:22.482

PIECE OF LITTLE THEY'RE NOT

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:34.327
WORTH GOING AFTER -- I DID

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:34.895
MANAGE TO EEK OUT PAYMENTS

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:36.430

A SATELLITE DISH -- TECHNICIAN

01:45:42.302 --> 01:45:44.705
AND WHAT I DID NOT THINK ABOUT

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:46.640
THE TIME WAS THAT I REALLY WAS

01:45:46.707 --> 01:45:48.775
NOT MAKING ANY OF THE PRINCIPAL

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.510
PAYMENTS I WAS ONLY REALLY.

01:45:50.577 --> 01:45:52.512
PAYING OFF LARGELY THE INTEREST

01:45:52.579 --> 01:45:54.247

01:45:54.314 --> 01:45:56.516
MOUNTING AND MOUNTING AND

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:58.218
MOUNTING BUT AGAIN I FIGURED

01:45:58.285 --> 01:46:00.353
WELL THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT SURELY

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.255
IF I JUST KEEP AT IT.

01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:04.324

RECESSION HEADS AND EVERYTHING

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:14.468

PAYMENTS ANYMORE COMPOUNDING THE

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:17.170
PROBLEM WAS THE EVER INCREASING

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:20.340
RANCH.

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:22.242

WITH THE TRAFFIC BECOMING AWARE

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:42.529
ONCE THEN I GOT TO SERVICE GOALS

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:46.233
AND FUNNY JUST ONE SERVICE CALL.

01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:48.435
I CAN JUSTIFY EIGHT FOUR HOURS

01:46:48.502 --> 01:46:50.137

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:18.251
ANY COURSE MATERIALS CHANGED HE

01:49:18.318 --> 01:49:20.186
WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE COURSE

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:24.190
OVER AGAIN AT NO CHARGE.

01:49:24.257 --> 01:49:24.791
YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE TO PAY LAB

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.192
FEES.

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:26.826
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TAKE THE

01:49:26.893 --> 01:49:28.595

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:32.198
THAT'S CLOSED.

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:36.169
SO THERE GOES THAT PROMISE --

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:38.405

01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:40.173

THE SCHOOL IN SELLING YOURSELF.

01:49:46.813 --> 01:49:48.214
IMMEDIATE JOB DISADVANTAGE.

01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:48.782
I'M STUCK WITH A WORTHLESS

01:49:48.848 --> 01:49:50.517
DEGREE FROM A SCHOOL THAT

01:49:50.583 --> 01:49:52.218

01:53:26.332 --> 01:53:26.499
CRISIS.

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:28.468
AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THAT ONE

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:30.203
POINT FIVE TRILLION THINK THAT

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.803
THAT'S IT'S A CRISIS BECAUSE

01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:32.672
LARGE AND BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:32.872
HAVE.

01:53:32.939 --> 01:53:34.407
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:35.008

ON THEIR LOANS AND THE VAST

01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:52.625
MAJORITY OF THOSE LOANS ARE

01:53:52.692 --> 01:53:56.296
FEDERAL LOANS.

01:53:56.362 --> 01:53:58.231
THEY HAVE PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS

01:53:58.298 --> 01:53:58.831
ATTACHED TO THEM THERE SHOULD

01:53:58.898 --> 01:54:00.567
NEVER BE A FEDERAL LOAN.

01:54:00.633 --> 01:54:02.335
IN DELINQUENCY OR DEFAULT

01:54:02.402 --> 01:54:08.374

TRY TO EDUCATE YOURSELF AND SOME

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:18.318
OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS PANEL HAVE

01:54:18.384 --> 01:54:18.851
ALREADY DEMONSTRATED TO

INCREDIBLE LENGTHS TO WHICH THEY

HAD TO GO TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES.

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:24.357

01:54:30.396 --> 01:54:32.332
BUT THE POINT IS.

01:54:32.398 --> 01:54:34.734
NO THE BURDEN SHOULD NOT BE ON

01:54:34.801 --> 01:54:36.603
THE BORROWER TO HAVE TO LEARN

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.538
STUDENT LOAN LAW OKAY THE BURDEN

01:54:38.605 --> 01:54:40.306
SHOULD NOT BE ON INDIVIDUAL

01:54:40.373 --> 01:54:40.907
PEOPLE TO HAVE TO NAVIGATE THE

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:42.275
SYSTEM.

01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:44.277
WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT FEDERAL

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:46.246
GOVERNMENT THAT IS CONTRACTING

01:54:46.312 --> 01:54:46.779

MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF THE

01:54:54.687 --> 01:54:56.556
BACKS OF BORROWERS SO WHY DON'T

THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:54:58.358 --> 01:55:00.493
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.228
THE BENEFITS AND THE RIGHTS THEY

THERE IS NO INDUSTRY WIDE

01:55:10.436 --> 01:55:12.305
CONSUMER PROTECTION FRAMEWORK

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:14.474
WITH ENFORCEABLE LEGAL RIGHTS

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.342
CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO STUDENT

LOAN SERVICERS -- A LOT OF WORK

01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:20.280
WAS DONE IN UNDER THE PREVIOUS

01:55:20.346 --> 01:55:20.913
ADMINISTRATION AT THE CONSUMER

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.548
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU TO

01:55:22.615 --> 01:55:24.450
TRY TO MOVE TOWARD CREATING

01:55:24.517 --> 01:55:26.219
REGULATIONS THAT WOULD BE

01:55:26.286 --> 01:55:26.753
ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THESE

01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:28.521
COMPANIES BUT THAT WORK UNDER

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:30.290
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS

BEEN UTTERLY SCRAPPED.

01:55:34.227 --> 01:55:34.727
SO WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DO.

01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:36.429
CALIFORNIA CAN DO WHAT IT DID.

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:38.298

THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE

01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:44.137
STEPPED UP BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:52.412
INCENTIVIZED IN ANY WAY TO

01:55:52.478 --> 01:55:54.380
PREVENT UNNECESSARY FORECLOSURES

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:56.416
SO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN

01:55:56.482 --> 01:55:58.217
TWENTY TWELVE PASSED THE

01:55:58.284 --> 01:55:58.685
CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER.

01:55:58.751 --> 01:56:00.620
RIGHT THAT MADE IT SERVICES HAVE

01:56:00.687 --> 01:56:02.322
TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO ENSURE

01:56:02.388 --> 01:56:04.424
THAT YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:06.192
APPLY FOR A LOAN MODIFICATION I

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:06.826
GET INFORMATION HAVE A SINGLE

01:56:06.893 --> 01:56:08.394
POINT OF CONTACT SOME REALLY

01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:10.229
BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO

01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:10.930
PREVENT PEOPLE FROM LOSING THEIR

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:11.164
HOMES.

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:12.598
WELL GUESS WHAT DOES NOT SOUND

01:56:12.665 --> 01:56:14.534
FAMILIAR WE HAVE LOAN SERVICERS

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.269
WERE THE GATEKEEPERS TO YOU

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:18.237
ACCESSING YOUR RIGHTS AS AN

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:20.139
EDUCATION LOAN BORROWER AND

01:56:20.206 --> 01:56:20.740
THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO

01:56:20.807 --> 01:56:21.007
HELP YOU.

01:56:21.074 --> 01:56:24.143
SO MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM ARE

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:24.811
WORKING ON LEGISLATION HAS BEEN

01:56:24.877 --> 01:56:28.247
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AB THREE

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:28.881
SEVENTY SIX THE STUDENT BORROWER

01:56:28.948 --> 01:56:29.248
BILL OF RIGHTS.

01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:30.616
THIS BILL WOULD BE A FIRST IN

01:56:30.683 --> 01:56:32.518
THE NATION PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:56:32.585 --> 01:56:34.354
TO CREATE AFFIRMATIVE

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.389
ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS FOR BORROWERS

01:56:36.456 --> 01:56:38.191
SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT.

01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:38.791
IT WOULD REQUIRE SERVICES TO

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:40.326
HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS TO TRAIN

01:56:40.393 --> 01:56:42.462
THEIR STAFF TO ACTUALLY KNOW

01:56:42.528 --> 01:56:44.397
WHAT PS A LOT IS TO KNOW ABOUT

01:56:44.464 --> 01:56:46.432
THAT TEMPORARY EXTENSION THAT

01:56:46.499 --> 01:56:48.301
YES IT DOES EXIST -- TO KNOW

01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:48.968
ABOUT DIFFERENT PAYMENT PLANS TO

01:56:49.035 --> 01:56:50.336
KNOW ABOUT SPECIAL.

01:56:50.403 --> 01:56:52.472
SPECIAL NEEDS AND RIGHTS THAT

01:56:52.538 --> 01:56:53.039
MAY APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:56:53.106 --> 01:56:54.474
CONNECTED TO THE MILITARY WHO

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.275
HAVE A DISABILITY BECAUSE

01:56:56.342 --> 01:56:58.144
SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE DISABLED YOU

01:56:58.211 --> 01:56:58.644
CAN GET YOUR LOAN CANCEL

01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:00.413
COMPLETELY -- PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:00.880
ELDERLY OTHER SPECIAL

01:57:00.947 --> 01:57:02.448
POPULATIONS IT WOULD PROHIBIT

01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:04.450
ABUSIVE PRACTICES ABUSIVE

01:57:04.517 --> 01:57:06.519
PRACTICES BEING DEFINED AS YOU

01:57:06.586 --> 01:57:08.454
LOAN SERVICER YOU CAN'T TAKE IT

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:10.223
ON REASONABLE ADVANTAGE OF

01:57:10.289 --> 01:57:12.158
SOMEONE IN ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND

01:57:12.225 --> 01:57:14.293
WHAT THE WORLD'S GOING ON WITH

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:14.761
THEIR STUDENT LOANS.

01:57:14.827 --> 01:57:16.529
AND THIS MAY LEAD THEM ASTRAY --

01:57:16.596 --> 01:57:18.364
THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ALSO

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:20.233
CREATE A BAR WITH ADVOCATE AT

01:57:20.299 --> 01:57:20.800
OUR EXISTING STATE FINANCIAL

01:57:20.867 --> 01:57:22.468
REGULATORS WOULD BE A POINT

01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:24.170
PERSON WHO WOULD BE A PUBLIC

01:57:24.237 --> 01:57:24.670
WATCHDOG -- POLICING THE

01:57:24.737 --> 01:57:26.539
INDUSTRY AND MAKING SURE THE

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:28.574
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE RIGHTS

01:57:28.641 --> 01:57:30.376
RESPECTED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:57:30.443 --> 01:57:32.478
IT WAS SUCH A DISSIDENT BECAUSE

01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:38.518
OF THESE STUDIES MINIMUM

01:57:38.584 --> 01:57:38.785
STANDARDS.

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:42.155
AND WE MAKE THEM ENFORCEABLE AND

01:57:42.221 --> 01:57:42.789
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU CAN

01:57:42.855 --> 01:57:43.289
HAVE YOUR DAY IN COURT.

01:57:43.356 --> 01:57:44.257
YOU CAN YOU CAN GO AFTER THEM

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:44.757
AND YOU CAN HOLD THEM

01:57:44.824 --> 01:57:45.324
ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY'RE NOT

01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:46.359
TREATING YOU PROPERLY US AND WE

01:57:46.426 --> 01:57:47.026
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A HUGE --

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:48.428
HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP FORWARD

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:50.329
AND AGAIN TO PROTECT THE THREE

01:57:50.396 --> 01:57:50.997
POINT SEVEN MILLION AND COUNTING

01:57:51.063 --> 01:57:52.598
PEOPLE WHO ARE A WHOLE LOANS IN

01:57:52.665 --> 01:57:54.434
THE STATE -- TO ENSURE THAT

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:55.001
THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHTS

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:56.502
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE WHEN LOAN

01:57:56.569 --> 01:57:58.304
SERVICERS FEEL YOU AS YOU'VE

01:57:58.371 --> 01:57:58.971
HEARD TODAY THEY HAVE FAILED TO

01:57:59.038 --> 01:58:00.640
MANY PEOPLE IT ADDS INSULT TO

01:58:00.706 --> 01:58:02.375
INJURY IT INCREASES THE OVERALL

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:02.575
COST.

01:58:02.642 --> 01:58:04.343
OF GETTING AN EDUCATION AND IT'S

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:06.446
SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE -- SO -- WE

01:58:06.512 --> 01:58:08.381
REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING THE

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:10.349
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS OF

01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:10.917
THE COMMITTEE -- TODAY AND

01:58:10.983 --> 01:58:12.485

01:58:16.422 --> 01:58:16.956
EXISTING CRISIS FOR THOSE WHO

01:58:17.023 --> 01:58:18.491
CURRENTLY HOLD STUDENT DEBT

I'M REALLY PLEASED TO WORKING

01:58:36.976 --> 01:58:38.411
WORKING WITH HAND.

01:58:38.478 --> 01:58:40.179
TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THIS CRISIS

01:58:40.246 --> 01:58:42.381
AND DO WHAT WE CAN IN CALIFORNIA

01:58:42.448 --> 01:58:46.452
TO ADDRESS THIS AND YOUR IN THE

01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:48.454
CONTEXT OF OF OUR CURRENT

01:58:48.521 --> 01:58:48.821
ADMINISTRATION.

01:58:48.888 --> 01:58:50.623
RIGHT I NEXT WE ARE GOING TO

MADAM CHAIR FOR PER BRINGING US

TOGETHER TODAY -- MY NAME'S

01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:02.468
JONATHAN LATER I TEACH HERE AT

01:59:02.535 --> 01:59:04.570
UCI SCHOOL OF LAW AND IN MY VERY

01:59:04.637 --> 01:59:06.506
BRIEF REMARKS AND MINDFUL OF THE

01:59:06.572 --> 01:59:08.474
TIME KEEPER OVER THERE -- I WANT

01:59:08.541 --> 01:59:10.409
TO MAKE THREE POINTS -- AND GIVE

01:59:10.476 --> 01:59:12.545
UP I JUST A HINT OF HISTORICAL

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:14.514
PERSPECTIVE -- AND ANTI THOSE

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.415
THREE POINTS -- TO A NEW

01:59:16.482 --> 01:59:18.484
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THIS LAW

01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:20.486
SCHOOL AND THE STUDENTS ARE

01:59:20.553 --> 01:59:20.920
PROTECTION CENTER.

01:59:20.987 --> 01:59:22.421
WAS THREE POINTS ARE THE NEED

01:59:22.488 --> 01:59:24.557
FOR REFORM OF LOT THEY NEED FOR

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:26.325
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:59:26.392 --> 01:59:28.227
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT.

01:59:28.294 --> 01:59:28.794
AND THE DANGER POSED BY THE

01:59:28.861 --> 01:59:32.198
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S

01:59:32.265 --> 01:59:34.200
POLICIES AND ACTION.

01:59:34.267 --> 01:59:34.834
I SHOULD CONFESS UP FRONT I'M A

01:59:34.901 --> 01:59:36.369
STUDENT LOAN BAR RECOVERING

01:59:36.435 --> 01:59:38.204
STUDENT ON BAR OR MYSELF.

01:59:38.271 --> 01:59:40.206
IT TOOK FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:42.408
I BORROWED A FRACTION OF WHAT MY

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:44.477
STUDENTS NOW HAVE TO BORROW TO

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:46.212
GO TO LAW SCHOOL.

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:46.846
SO TO BE CLEAR THE AVAILABILITY

01:59:46.913 --> 01:59:48.548
OF STUDENT LOANS IS PUT HIGHER

01:59:48.614 --> 01:59:50.182
EDUCATION WITHIN REACH OF

01:59:50.249 --> 01:59:50.750
GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS WHO

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:52.385
OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:54.320
ABLE TO FINANCE THE COST WE

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:54.954
SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT.

01:59:55.021 --> 01:59:56.489
BUT AS A POLICY TOOL WHAT WE'VE

01:59:56.556 --> 01:59:58.424
SEEN TODAY IS THAT THAT IS VERY

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:00.192
MUCH A TWO EDGED INSTRUMENT

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:00.893
BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN IMPOSED ON

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.228
THE BORROWER'S.

02:00:02.295 --> 02:00:04.297
WHEN FEDERAL LAWMAKERS A HALF

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:06.198
CENTURY AGO -- LAID THE

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:06.732
FOUNDATION OF THE FEDERAL

02:00:06.799 --> 02:00:08.434
STUDENT AID REGIME THAT WE STILL

02:00:08.501 --> 02:00:10.269
HAVE TODAY THEY DID NOT

02:00:10.336 --> 02:00:10.903
ANTICIPATE THAT THE LOANS WOULD

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:14.173
BE THE KEY POLICY INTERVENTION

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:14.740
THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:18.210
GRANTS.

02:00:18.277 --> 02:00:18.844
TODAY WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:22.181
HARMS THAT DAD CAUSES SO WHAT

02:00:22.248 --> 02:00:22.848
NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE MIGHT THREE

02:00:22.915 --> 02:00:26.218
POINTS FIRST REFORM OF LAW.

02:00:26.285 --> 02:00:26.786
THE PROBLEMS THAT THE PRIOR

02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:28.254
SPEAKERS HAVE DESCRIBED IN

02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:30.456
VISCERAL DETAIL -- HAVE ALLUDED

02:00:30.523 --> 02:00:32.191
TO THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:34.427
PROPOSALS FOR FIXES THAT IT AB.

02:00:34.493 --> 02:00:36.529
CAN HELP STUDENTS COPE WITH

02:00:36.596 --> 02:00:38.230
INDEBTEDNESS THIS INCLUDES A

02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:40.333
VARIETY OF A RANGE OF OPTIONS

02:00:40.399 --> 02:00:42.301
FROM THE INCREMENTAL TO THE GAME

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:42.568
CHANGING.

02:00:42.635 --> 02:00:44.503
THAT LIST INCLUDES AT THE

02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:46.472
FEDERAL LEVEL CHANGES TO THE

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:48.341
BANKRUPTCY CODE TO MAKE

02:00:48.407 --> 02:00:50.242
DISCHARGE MORE POSSIBLE.

02:00:50.309 --> 02:00:50.876
AT THE STATE LEVEL STRENGTHENING

02:00:50.943 --> 02:00:52.578
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF STUDENT

02:00:52.645 --> 02:00:54.313
LOAN SERVICERS AND THE FOR

02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:54.947
PROFIT INSTITUTIONS THAT WE'VE

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:56.315
HEARD MORE ABOUT.

02:00:56.382 --> 02:00:58.184
AND COMING UP WITH A WORKABLE

02:00:58.250 --> 02:01:00.319
HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCE REGIME

02:01:00.386 --> 02:01:00.953
THAT RE ALLOCATE THE COST BACK

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:02.655
FROM STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO

02:01:02.722 --> 02:01:04.523
THE TAXPAYER BECAUSE THE SIMPLE

02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:06.559
TRUTH IS WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:08.394
HIGHER EDUCATION IS ACCESSIBLE

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:10.229
ON A FAIR AND EQUITABLE BASIS.

02:01:10.296 --> 02:01:12.298
SO EXPANDING THE CAL GRANT RIGHT

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:14.433
ONE OF THE BILLS IT'S CURRENTLY --

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.235
OUT THERE.

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:16.902
AND THEN SOME MORE INNOVATIVE

02:01:16.969 --> 02:01:18.504
OPTIONS LIKE FRONT LOADING THE

02:01:18.571 --> 02:01:20.606
PELL GRANT -- I WAS TALKING WITH

02:01:20.673 --> 02:01:24.410
A COLLEAGUE BEFORE THIS EVENT

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:24.777
STARTED ABOUT.

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:26.212
IF THE CAL GRANT WERE STRUCTURED

02:01:26.278 --> 02:01:26.912
SO THAT IT PROVIDED MORE CASH UP

02:01:26.979 --> 02:01:28.648
FRONT IN THE EARLY YEARS WHICH

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:30.483
IS WHEN STUDENTS -- THIS MORE

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:32.418
OFTEN MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

02:01:32.485 --> 02:01:34.487
IN THE PAYMENT -- THEN IF THEY

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:36.389
HAVE TO LEAVE SCHOOL FOR ANY

02:01:36.455 --> 02:01:38.290
REASON THE LOAN APPLICATION THEY

02:01:38.357 --> 02:01:38.924
WOULD FACE WOULD BE THAT MUCH

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:40.292
LATER.

02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:40.893
SECOND THE NEED FOR MORE AND

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:42.595
BETTER EMPIRICAL RESEARCH WE

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:44.563
DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT ALL OF

02:01:44.630 --> 02:01:46.399
THE IMPLICATIONS OF STUDENT

02:01:46.465 --> 02:01:46.732
INDEBTEDNESS.

02:01:46.799 --> 02:01:48.768
WE AS SCHOLARS DO NOT CURRENTLY

02:01:48.834 --> 02:01:50.703
HAVE LONGITUDINAL DATA TRACKING

02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:54.273
STUDENT BORROWERS OVER TIME AS

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:54.907
COMPLETELY AS WE WOULD LIKE.

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:56.709
SO WE NEED BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC

02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:58.477
INFORMATION ON WHO BORROWS HOW

02:01:58.544 --> 02:02:00.680
MUCH TO GO TO WHAT KIND OF

02:02:00.746 --> 02:02:02.381
SCHOOL TO EXPERIENCE WHAT KIND

02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:04.283
OF OUTCOME TO A COMPLETE OR NOT.

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:04.884
AND TO LAND WHAT KIND OF JOB

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:08.220
EARNING WHAT KIND OF INCOME

02:02:08.287 --> 02:02:08.754
WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION.

02:02:08.821 --> 02:02:10.623
DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE IN POSITIVE

02:02:10.690 --> 02:02:12.425
INTERVENTIONS LIKE THESE I'VE

02:02:12.491 --> 02:02:14.493
ALREADY ALLUDED TO IS THAT MUCH

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.295
MORE DIFFICULT.

02:02:16.362 --> 02:02:16.929
THIRD WE NEED FOR STEPPED UP

02:02:16.996 --> 02:02:17.530
STATE ACTION IN LIGHT OF THE

02:02:17.596 --> 02:02:18.364
FEDERAL ABSENCE.

02:02:18.431 --> 02:02:20.332
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:20.900
WASHINGTON IS NOT ONLY NOT

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:22.468
TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS THE

02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:24.270
PROBLEMS CREATED BY STUDENT

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:26.205
INDEBTEDNESS IS ACTIVELY WORKING

02:02:26.272 --> 02:02:26.806
TO UNDO POLICIES THAT WERE

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.474
INTENDED TO MEDICATE HARM UNDER

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:30.242
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

02:02:30.309 --> 02:02:32.378
THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED LAST

02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:32.878
MONTH AT THE EDUCATION

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:34.380
DEPARTMENT DID NOT APPROVE A

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:34.980
SINGLE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:36.649
STUDENT LOAN RELIEF IN THE

02:02:36.716 --> 02:02:38.317
SECOND HALF OF LAST YEAR. FOR

02:02:38.384 --> 02:02:40.586

02:02:44.356 --> 02:02:44.790
THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO

INSTITUTION WHOSE STUDENTS

02:02:50.463 --> 02:02:52.364

02:02:56.368 --> 02:02:58.204
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO TALK

02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:58.871
ABOUT HOW POORLY THE DEPARTMENT

02:02:58.938 --> 02:03:00.406

HEARD THE SCHOOLS ARE VERY

02:04:42.208 --> 02:04:44.143
EXPENSIVE AND OFTEN HAVE VERY

02:04:44.210 --> 02:04:44.877
POOR OUTCOMES FOR THEIR STUDENTS --

STAGGERING NUMBER OF FOLKS ARE

02:04:58.390 --> 02:05:00.259
INTO FALL IN CALIFORNIA BUT I

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:00.860
WANTED TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:02.494
WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THE

02:05:02.561 --> 02:05:04.363
CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAULT.

02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:06.532

BAR WAS WONDERFUL AS WE'VE HEARD

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:23.048

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:26.552
CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION -- TO

02:05:26.619 --> 02:05:30.155
BETTER THEIR ECONOMIC PROSPECTS --

02:05:30.222 --> 02:05:32.324
THEIR CREDIT IS RUINED -- WHICH

02:05:32.391 --> 02:05:34.226
AFFECTS EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND

02:05:34.293 --> 02:05:36.161
JUST THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD

02:05:36.228 --> 02:05:38.163
WITH THEIR LIVES -- WE'VE HEARD

02:05:38.230 --> 02:05:40.266
BRIEFLY ABOUT THE EFFORTS TO HI

02:05:40.332 --> 02:05:42.234
DISCHARGED STUDENT LOANS IN

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:42.835
BANKRUPTCY BUT BECAUSE OF THE

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:44.570
CURRENT UNDUE HARDSHIP STANDARD

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:46.205
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR

02:05:46.272 --> 02:05:48.207
BORROWERS. TO NAVIGATE THAT ON

02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:48.507
THEIR OWN.

02:05:48.574 --> 02:05:50.542
AND THERE IS NO STATUTE OF

02:05:50.609 --> 02:05:52.311
LIMITATIONS ON STUDENT DIED ON

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:54.213
FEDERAL STUDENT AT SO THE

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.482
GOVERNMENT CAN COLLECT FOR THE

02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:56.916
REST OF YOUR LIFE.

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:58.584
IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL

02:05:58.651 --> 02:06:00.286
STUDENT LOAN ISSUE A LOT OF THE

02:06:00.352 --> 02:06:02.154
BARS AND I WORK WITH A STRUGGLE

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:02.755
WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:04.456
PRIVATE STUDENT DEBT IN FACT AND

02:06:04.523 --> 02:06:06.558
FACE DEBT COLLECTION LAWSUITS.

02:06:06.625 --> 02:06:08.627
A SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW THE

02:06:08.694 --> 02:06:10.429
MORTGAGE CRISIS -- THESE DEBTS

02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:12.631
ARE ARE BAD THAT AND THEY ARE

02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:14.466
TRANSFERRED SEVERAL TIMES AND

02:06:14.533 --> 02:06:18.170
OFTEN LOCK PROPER DOCUMENTATION

02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:20.406
AND I UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THE

02:06:20.472 --> 02:06:22.308
BORROWERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:22.641
REPRESENTED.

02:06:22.708 --> 02:06:24.343
AND SO CALIFORNIA COURTS ARE

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.211
RUBBER STAMPING THOUSANDS OF

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:28.547
DEFAULT JUDGMENTS AGAINST THESE

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:30.182
BORROWERS.

02:06:30.249 --> 02:06:30.816
AND SO I THINK WE'RE ALL HERE

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:32.618
TODAY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT

02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:34.520
WE ARE IN A DIRE STUDENT DEBT

02:06:34.586 --> 02:06:36.188

CONSTANTLY SEEKING ASSISTANCE

02:06:40.559 --> 02:06:42.661
AND ONE WAY THAT WE ARE HELPING

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:44.496
BOWERS IS TO STOP INVOLUNTARY

02:06:44.563 --> 02:06:48.167
COLLECTION BY GETTING VIRUS OUT

02:06:48.233 --> 02:06:48.467
OF DEFAULT.

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:49.001
AND INTO INCOME DIFFERENT

02:06:49.068 --> 02:06:50.502

WITH A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:48.647
FIRST WE SHOULD ENACT STRONG

02:09:48.714 --> 02:09:50.649
MINIMUM STANDARDS TO STOP AND TO

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:52.684

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:54.686
AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:56.588
INCREASE FINANCIAL AID SO THAT

02:09:56.655 --> 02:09:58.390
WE CAN ASSIST LOW INCOME

02:09:58.457 --> 02:10:00.459
BORROWERS TO COMPLETE --

02:10:00.526 --> 02:10:02.461
PROGRAMS THAT LEGITIMATE

02:10:06.532 --> 02:10:08.233
COLLEGES.

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:10.202
NEXT WE NEED TO RESTORE ACCESS

02:10:10.269 --> 02:10:12.337

02:10:12.404 --> 02:10:12.905

02:14:42.374 --> 02:14:44.643
I HAVE TRIED AND REQUESTED MANY

02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:48.180

AND IT HAS RUINED MY CREDIT --

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:02.294
IT'S JUST.

02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:06.264
IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:08.166

SOME YOU SEE I STUDENT I JUST

02:16:24.843 --> 02:16:26.311
WANNA BE BRIEF TODAY -- AND

02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:28.280
SHARE SOME THOUGHTS FROM A LOT

02:16:28.346 --> 02:16:28.813
OF MEMBERS OF OUR STUDENT

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:30.582
GOVERNMENT ON JUST IN TERMS OF

02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:32.450
THINKING ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF

02:16:32.517 --> 02:16:34.219
HOW WE GOT HERE.

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:34.719
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN

02:16:34.786 --> 02:16:36.555
INSEPARABLE CONVERSATION TO TALK

02:16:36.621 --> 02:16:38.490
ABOUT DEBT AND THE COST OF

02:16:38.557 --> 02:16:40.258
EDUCATION ITSELF THE COST HAS

02:16:40.325 --> 02:16:42.227
BALLOONED ENORMOUSLY.

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:42.827
ON I DID NOT KNOW THIS WHEN I

02:16:42.894 --> 02:16:44.496
BEGAN AT UCI BUT THE STATE OF

02:16:44.563 --> 02:16:48.266
CALIFORNIA HAS A MASTER PLAN FOR

02:16:48.333 --> 02:16:50.302
EDUCATION THAT WE ADOPTED IN.

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:52.270
NINETEEN SIXTY UNDER PAT BROWN

02:16:52.337 --> 02:16:52.938
AND I REALLY THINK THAT HELPED

02:16:53.004 --> 02:16:56.174
OUR STATE BECOME THE ECONOMIC

02:16:56.241 --> 02:16:56.841
SUPER POWER THAT IT IS TODAY.

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:58.410
BUT WE ABANDONED THAT MASTER

02:16:58.476 --> 02:17:00.645
PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN.

02:17:00.712 --> 02:17:02.447
TWO THOUSAND AND SINCE THEN THE

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:04.182
COST OF TUITION HAS INCREASED

02:17:04.249 --> 02:17:06.184
EXPONENTIALLY FOR YOU SEE CSU

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:08.253
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS --

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:12.190
RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA SPENDS LESS

02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:12.824
ON STUDENTS LIKE ME SAUL AND

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:16.328
OTHERS THAN IT DOES ON THE

02:17:16.394 --> 02:17:18.229
AVERAGE THIRD GRADER.

02:17:18.296 --> 02:17:20.265
THAN THE AVERAGE THIRD GRADER ON

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:20.532
YOUR KIDS.

02:17:20.599 --> 02:17:26.271
ON RIGHT NOW WE SPEND 610070% AS

02:17:26.338 --> 02:17:28.273
MUCH AS WE DO ON PRISONERS IN

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:30.342
CALIFORNIA AS WE DO ON UC

02:17:30.408 --> 02:17:32.344
STUDENTS -- AND I WAS TROUBLING

02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:32.978
FOR ME TO LEARN BECAUSE WHEN I

02:17:33.044 --> 02:17:34.546
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL MY SOPHOMORE

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:36.648
AND JUNIOR YEARS MY FATHER WAS

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:36.948
IN PRISON.

02:17:37.015 --> 02:17:38.683
SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPEND

02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:42.187
MORE INCARCERATING MEMBER OF MY

02:17:42.253 --> 02:17:42.821
FAMILY THAN THEY HAVE SPENT ON

02:17:42.887 --> 02:17:46.224
EDUCATION. FOR MY FAMILY.

02:17:46.291 --> 02:17:48.293
AND SO I DISAGREE SLIGHTLY WITH

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.261
SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY

02:17:50.328 --> 02:17:50.929
THE FINANCIAL AID DIRECTOR THAT

02:17:50.996 --> 02:17:54.232
THESE ARE SELF HELP LOANS.

02:17:54.299 --> 02:17:54.866
BECAUSE IT DEBT IS A BURDEN

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:56.568
STUDENT DEBT IS THE BURDEN IS A

02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:58.503
BURDEN FOR THAT TO BE PLACED ON

02:17:58.570 --> 02:17:58.770
SOMEBODY.

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:00.605
SO I WOULD LOVE FOR THE STATE OF

02:18:00.672 --> 02:18:02.574
CALIFORNIA FOR YOU ALL TO THINK

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:04.542
AMBITIOUSLY TO BE BOLD BECAUSE

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:06.411
WE HAVE FAITH IN YOUR LEADERSHIP

02:18:06.478 --> 02:18:08.246
WE KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN A

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:10.181
SERIOUS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME

02:18:10.248 --> 02:18:10.682

02:19:34.466 --> 02:19:38.336
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT -- THAT I

02:19:38.403 --> 02:19:40.238

02:19:48.346 --> 02:19:50.448
THERE'S SOME FEAR THERE'S LACK

OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND THAT'S

02:19:52.484 --> 02:19:54.252
WHY THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ELEVATED.

02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:54.886
IN THE PAST AND I WOULD JUST SAY

02:19:54.953 --> 02:19:56.254
THAT.

02:19:56.321 --> 02:19:58.356
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

02:19:58.423 --> 02:19:58.957
LEGISLATORS UNDERSTAND THAT'S

02:19:59.023 --> 02:20:00.258
WHAT A SHAME.

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:02.494

MY SKILLS AND MARKETABILITY.

02:23:48.252 --> 02:23:50.221
THE SCHOOL I CHOSE WAS BASED ON

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:50.855
THE FACT THAT I COULD CONTINUE

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:52.357

COST ME TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:44.288
CENTS EVERY MINUTE -- NOT A

02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:58.689
AT AND WAS ALREADY INTERESTED IN

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:00.557
BUT ALSO BECAUSE IF I WERE TO

02:35:00.624 --> 02:35:02.559
PURSUE A SCIENCE DEGREE OUT OF

02:35:02.626 --> 02:35:03.127
PROBABLY HAVE TO TAKE OUT A

02:35:03.193 --> 02:35:04.294
WHOLE BUNCH.

02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:04.962
LOANS AND I'M I GREW UP WANTING

02:35:05.029 --> 02:35:06.497
TO BE ASSIGNED AS WAS LOCATED SO

02:35:06.563 --> 02:35:08.565
I MEAN I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE

02:35:08.632 --> 02:35:10.501
REPERCUSSIONS THAT MIGHT BE FOR

02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:10.868
ME IF I WERE.

02:35:10.934 --> 02:35:12.469
TO FOLLOW SOME OF THE MORE

02:35:12.536 --> 02:35:14.438
COMPLICATED POTS AND THAT WOULD

02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:16.573
TAKE A MUCH LONGER EDUCATIONAL --

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:20.177
INVESTMENT AND THAT WOULD HAVE

02:35:20.244 --> 02:35:22.312
COST ME A GREAT DEAL ON STUDENT

02:35:22.379 --> 02:35:22.980
LOANS SO THAT'S WHY I PICKED THE

02:35:23.047 --> 02:35:24.314
DEGREE I CHOSE.

02:35:24.381 --> 02:35:26.183
A BEFORE I GOT TO YOU SEE I

02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:26.850

02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:48.405
AND I A WAS PREPARED BEFORE EVEN

02:35:48.472 --> 02:35:50.240
GETTING YOU SEE I THINKING --

02:35:50.307 --> 02:35:56.180
OVER THE SUMMER I NEED TO WORK

02:35:56.246 --> 02:35:56.847
THREE DIFFERENT JOBS WHICH I DID.

02:35:56.914 --> 02:35:58.348
I HAD PEOPLE BASICALLY DONATE I

02:35:58.415 --> 02:35:59.016
DID GO FUND ME -- TO TO BE ABLE

02:35:59.083 --> 02:36:00.551
TO HAVE SOME MONEY SAVED UP

02:36:00.617 --> 02:36:01.218
BECAUSE I HAD A FEELING AND THIS

02:36:01.285 --> 02:36:02.352
WAS PROBABLY THIS IS WHAT AND

02:36:02.419 --> 02:36:02.953
EVENTUALLY BECAME THE CASE.

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:04.621
THAT -- IS GONNA TAKE WHILE FOR

02:36:04.688 --> 02:36:06.523
FINANCIALLY TO ACTUALLY GET TO

ME SO I DO NOT HOUSING THE FIRST

02:36:08.525 --> 02:36:10.561
WEEK OR SO OF SCHOOL BECAUSE THE

02:36:10.627 --> 02:36:12.629
ONLY HOUSING I COULD SECURE WAS

02:36:12.696 --> 02:36:14.465
AND THE OCTOBER WHICH AND SCHOOL

02:36:14.531 --> 02:36:16.166
STARTED LIKE THE WEEK BEFORE

02:36:16.233 --> 02:36:16.366
THAT.

02:36:16.433 --> 02:36:18.335
AND I WAS SO SCARED OF LIKE NOT

02:36:18.402 --> 02:36:20.304
BEING ABLE TO ATTEND MY CLASSES

02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:22.239
AND HAVING BEEN VESTED IN

02:36:22.306 --> 02:36:24.174
SACRIFICE I GIVE UP MY APARTMENT

02:36:24.241 --> 02:36:26.410
IN INGLEWOOD -- LIKE THAT I

02:36:26.477 --> 02:36:28.278

OVER THERE FOR LIKE THE FIRST

02:36:32.416 --> 02:36:34.218
FIVE DAYS IN A TENT.

02:36:34.284 --> 02:36:36.220
I HAVE RECORDS OF ALL THIS.

02:36:36.286 --> 02:36:38.288
WITH THAT BEING THE CASE -- I

02:36:38.355 --> 02:36:40.457
WAS REVIEWING A LOT OF THE THE

02:36:40.524 --> 02:36:42.192
STATEMENTS ARE BY MADE AND I WAS

02:36:42.259 --> 02:36:44.228
I JUST FEEL LIKE PEOPLE HAVE A

02:36:44.294 --> 02:36:44.828
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF JUST

02:36:44.895 --> 02:36:46.663
HOW -- EDUCATION PLAYS INTO OUR

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:50.434
ECONOMY AS A US CITY STATE AND

02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:50.701
COUNTRY.

02:36:50.768 --> 02:36:52.703
AND THAT ARE CUT ECONOMIC SYSTEM

02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:56.173
IS BIASED AND NOT FUNCTIONING

02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:58.242

MUCH POWER IN THIS ROOM RIGHT

02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:04.181
NOW -- I THINK WE NEED TO TRYING

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:04.815
