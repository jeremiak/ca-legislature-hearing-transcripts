LET ME JUST FIRST THANK YOU FOR

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:33.411
YOUR LEADERSHIP FOR THE

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:35.246
COMMITTEES LEADERSHIP. ON

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:38.183
LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE OF DJJ-

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:41.619
I THINK. RETHINKING HOW WE DO

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:43.388
JUVENILE JUSTICE IS EXTREMELY

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:46.024
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE STAKES

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:47.358
ARE VERY HIGH. IF WE GET A

00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:48.660
WRONG WE COULD SEND YOUNG

00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:51.629
PEOPLE. DOWN A PERMANENT PATH.

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:53.832
IN A PERMANENT PRESENCE IN OUR

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:55.767
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IF WE

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:58.036
DO IT RIGHT. PEOPLE WILL BE

00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:00.405
ABLE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES BECOME

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:02.740
PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS. GET

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:05.443
EMPLOYMENT GET HOUSING. REALLY

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.378
BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:09.447
SO THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:11.316
DECISION BECAUSE THIS IS AN

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:13.451
AREA WHERE THE STATE HASN'T

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:17.355
BEEN DOING IT RIGHT. THAT'S WHY

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:17.755
WE WORKED WITH THE

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:18.590
ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR WITH

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:20.859
THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE DJJ AWAY

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:22.293
FROM CDC ARE AND HEALTH AND

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.596
HUMAN SERVICES- I WOULD SAY

00:29:24.662 --> 00:29:26.865
THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.033
THAT SPECIFIC PROPOSAL AND-

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.202
SOME OF THE DETAILS I THINK WE-

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.838
AS A LEGISLATURE. TOOK ON FAITH

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:34.839
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:36.908
HOPES THAT WE COULD MAKE

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:38.810
IMPROVEMENTS SEE SOME REFORMS.

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.578
REPEAT DO BETTER BY ALL THE

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:42.614
YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.749
WHAT'S CONCERNING IS THIS YEAR.%

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:47.752
THE NEW PROPOSAL TO REALIGN

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:51.523
MANY OF THE- THE JUVENILES INTO

00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:54.626
OUR VARIOUS COUNTIES. AND WHILE

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:57.729
WE ARE LOOKING FOR COST SAVINGS

00:29:57.795 --> 00:30:00.565
IN THIS AREA. THE COST SAVINGS

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.000
COME BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:04.502
PEOPLE RETURN. IT DOESN'T MEAN

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:06.237
THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN THE

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.605
SYSTEM THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:09.641
LOOKING TO BE PENNY WISE AND

00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:12.143
POUND FOOLISH. WE REALLY NEED

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.545
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:15.813
THE PROPER INVESTMENTS TODAY SO

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.749
WE SAVE THE DOLLARS DOWN THE

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:19.484
ROAD SO INSTEAD OF. USING OUR

00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:21.186
TAX DOLLARS. ALL THE

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:23.054
INDIVIDUALS BECOME TAXPAYERS.

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:24.522
AND SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:26.824
CRITICAL DECISION TO ENSURE

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:29.494
THAT WE ARE NOT AGAIN TRYING TO

00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.096
SAVE MONEY TODAY AND SPEND

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.831
MONEY A LOT MORE MONEY DOWN THE

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:39.571
ROAD. HELLO WE BELIEVE THAT WE

00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:40.838
HAVE A PROPOSED OFFICE OF YOUTH

00:30:40.905 --> 00:30:43.808
JUSTICE AT HHS THAT THIS

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:46.110
PROVIDES A GOOD OPPORTUNITY IN

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:48.980
A GOOD PLACE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:50.081
AND OVERSIGHT IN THE RIGHT

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:51.716
PROGRAMS I THINK THERE IS A

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:56.955
CONCERN ABOUT. HOW THIS

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:57.555
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTIES

00:30:57.622 --> 00:30:59.857
WILL GO. OUT WE ARE CONCERNED

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:01.859
THAT WERE FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:03.895
EACH INDIVIDUAL DOLLAR RATHER

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.863
THAN THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.433
OF THE PROGRAM. I THINK WE HAVE

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:10.001
TO MAKE SURE THAT AGAIN WERE

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:13.605
NOT. FOCUSED ON COST CUTTING IN

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:17.442
ORDER TO. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

00:31:17.508 --> 00:31:18.676
THAT TIS PRODUCT IS A BETTER

00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:20.144
PRODUCT IN THAT WORK PROPERLY

00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:24.182
SERVING. THESE CUSTOMERS. WE

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:25.817
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DO BETTER BY

00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:27.218
ALL THESE YOUNG FOLKS WE'VE

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:29.921
SEEN NOW OVER THE LAST FEW

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:31.389
DECADES THE MISTAKE THAT WE

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:34.659
MADE. WE THOUGHT THAT IF WE

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:35.994
COULD JUST INCARCERATE PEOPLE

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.496
FOR LONGER. SOMEHOW THAT

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.398
SOCIETY WOULD BE SAFER HAS

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:42.233
IMPROVE THE NECESSARY THE CASE.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.302
ALL IT HAS IS GROWN THE BUDGETS

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:45.837
OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:47.839
AT TE EXPENSE OF BEING AT THE

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:49.407
FRONT HEALTH CARE. THE FUND

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:51.442
EDUCATION BE ABLE TO FUND OUR

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:53.444
UNIVERSITIES BE ABLE TO FIND

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:55.146
THE MOST CRITICAL SERVICES THAT

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:56.681
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE DEMANDING

00:31:56.748 --> 00:32:00.585
IN ASKING FOR. TODAY SO AGAIN I

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:01.753
THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:04.222
FOCUS ON WHAT WE SHOULD BE

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:07.725
DOING. TO PROPERLY SERVE. THESE

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:09.661
YOUNG PEOPLE. SO THAT THIS IS

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.362
THE ONE AND ONLY STEP IN THE

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:13.097
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:13.598
DOESN'T LEAD THEM DOWN A

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:16.267
PERMANENT PATH. I THINK WE HAVE

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:16.901
TO THINK VERY HARD ABOUT WHAT

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:18.703
ARE THE PROPER SERVICES. THAT

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.005
WE NEED TO PROVIDE THEM AT THIS

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:23.374
YOUNG AGE SO THAT THEY CAN GET.

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.310
THE HELP TO TURN THEIR LIFE

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:27.812
AROUND. I FULLY BELIEVE THE

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:28.946
GIVEN THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.815
THAT MANY OF THEM AND MOST OF

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.518
THEM WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:35.853
THINK AT THIS POINT AS STATE WE

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.121
HAVE FAILED. IT HAVE A- THE

00:32:37.188 --> 00:32:39.891
SERVICE. AND THOUGHT. WE SEE

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.292
THEM LATER ON A LIFE AND

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.328
UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR ADULT

00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:45.229
PRISONS SO WITH THAT LET ME

LONG WAY. WITH DJJ- MANY YEARS

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.481
AGO IT WAS CALLED TO SEE WHAT A

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:04.415

AND WE ALL USE LOCALLY. IT

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:29.340
SEEMS RIGHT THAT SUCH A SMALL

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:30.775
SYSTEM SMALLER THAN A MIDDLE

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:33.244
SCHOOL CAN BE A OF A RELYING TO

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:34.712

WHO COME TO. WHO COULD BE SENT

TO DJJ. BUT THEY'RE KEPT

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:48.326
LOCALLY SO WE KNOW THAT IT CAN

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:49.927
BE DONE. WHILE WE MAY SUPPORT A

OVERSIGHT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE

00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:00.872
THAT WE ARE NOT CREATING

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:03.674
JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY. WE WANT

RACIAL DISPARITIES CONTINUE TO

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:15.052
BE A PROBLEM AS BLACK AND BROWN

REDUCE THESE DISPARITIES. I DO

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:25.930
NOT SYSTEM IS A BETTER SYSTEM

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:27.999
THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO BUT

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:29.100
WHAT WE DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:30.535
WILL HELP DETERMINE WHETHER WE

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.470
CAN CONTINUE ON THIS POSITIVE

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.405

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:31.876

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:39.884
WE'RE SORT OF JUMPING TO.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.286
REALIGNING YOUTH SERVICES OUT

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:44.555
TO COUNTIES AND IF THE REASON

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:46.223
THAT'S BEING DONE IS PURELY

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.492
FISCAL WE WILL FAIL THESE YOU

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:49.760
THERE IS AN ABSOLUTELY NO

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.362
QUESTION ABOUT THAT. SO I

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:52.329
APPRECIATE THE WORK AT THE

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:53.964
COMMITTEES DONE AND HAS BEEN

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:54.565
DOING OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:57.068
YEARS. TO CREATE A MUCH

00:38:57.134 --> 00:38:58.769
STRONGER FRAMEWORK BECAUSE THIS

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:02.006
IT HASN'T ABSOLUTE INTEREST IN

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:03.908
ENSURING CONSISTENCY. L. AND

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:06.177
BEST PRACTICES ACROSS ALL OF

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:08.713
THE COUNTIES AND THAT HAVE TO

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:09.914

WE WILL FAIL THOSE YOU THERE'S

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:14.452
REALLY NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.087
WE NEED TO HAVE APPROPRIATE

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:17.788
LICENSING REGULATORY AUTHORITY

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:18.556
BUT THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:22.093
SEPARATE FROM. THE THAT THE

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:25.930
THINK TANK ASPECT OF WHAT A AT

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:27.398
AN AGENCY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:29.400
COULD DO WITHIN STATE

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.535
GOVERNMENT IS IF WE END UP WITH

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:33.738
IT MATTERING WHERE A CHILD

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:34.905
THAT'S IN TROUBLE AND IS BEING

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:38.109
SERVED. IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN WE

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:40.778
HAVE FAILED OUR YOUTH IN THIS

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:44.482
STATE SO HAVING A- THE ABILITY

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.584
FOR THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.718
WE'RE SEEING. APPROPRIATE

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:49.787
LEVELS OF SERVICES ACROSS THE

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:53.457
BOARD IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.860
WE ALSO DJJ AS YOU MENTIONED

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:57.728
THAT I'M SURE HAS MADE SOME.

00:39:57.795 --> 00:39:58.896
STRIDES OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF

00:39:58.963 --> 00:39:59.697
YEARS AND THERE ARE SOME

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:01.832
PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING THE

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.200
SEX OFFENDER PROGRAM FOR

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.269
EXAMPLE AND OTHERS. THOSE ARE

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:06.303
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.606
REPLICATE COUNTY BY COUNTY BY

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:11.175
COUNTY. N. WE NEED A REGIONAL

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:15.379
APPROACH OR EVEN ARGUABLY ACE

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:17.548
STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT OF A

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.517
PROGRAM THAT SO THOSE ARE THE

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:21.986
DETAILS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:23.320
FILL IN. OVER TIME AND MAKE

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:26.323
SURE THAT WE ULTIMATELY HAVE

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.225
ANSWERS TO SO THIS IS AN

00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:29.827
OPPORTUNITY FOR US ACROSS THE

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:31.328
STATE AND I NOTED IN TALKING TO

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:32.997
PROBATION CHIEFS THERE ARE.

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:34.098
SOME THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:35.332
THIS SOME THAT ARE VERY WORRIED

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:36.433
AND WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.135
THE MOST AYE I THINK IN TALKING

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:39.436
THEM IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:41.272
BE SHORT CHANGED AND LEFT

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:42.907
WITHOUT THE RESOURCES. TO

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:46.443
ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SERVICES TO

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.046
THE- THE USE THAT THEY ARE

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.081
TRYING TO SERVE AND- THAT IS

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:52.316
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THAT WE

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:54.618
HAVE TO SAFEGUARD WITH I AGREE

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:55.686
COMPLETELY WITH THE NOTION THAT

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:56.120
IF WE MAKE THE RIGHT

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:58.122
INVESTMENTS. AND WE CREATE AN

00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:00.157
APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE NOW THE

00:41:00.224 --> 00:41:03.327
SAVINGS WILL CALM BUT IF WHAT

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.696
WE DO TODAY IS SEEN MERELY FOR

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:09.400
THE LAND. OF FISCAL GIVING THEN

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:12.069
THIS IS GOING TO EXACERBATE THE

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:15.573
CITY AND THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSE

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:21.478

THEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN.

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:38.229

WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I'M

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:47.635
UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE ALL

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:48.436
OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.638
MADE HERE BY ALL THE PANELISTS-

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.874
AND YOU FEEL LIKE THERE ARE.

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.008
MANY AREAS WHERE WE HAVE COMMON

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:56.177
GROUND. I AM I THINK A COUPLE

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:57.245
OF THE THINGS THAT I JUST

01:26:57.312 --> 01:26:59.447
WANTED TO THE SITE AS- SOME.

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:01.549
MORE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS IS

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:04.218
THE TINY I'M AND WHILE I AGREE

01:27:04.285 --> 01:27:05.753
THE INTENT IS NOT JUST TO

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.889
ADDRESS A PHYSICAL SITUATION.

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:09.123
IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE RIGHT

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:10.291
POLICY WE DO THINK THESE YOU

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:11.926
CAN BE SERVED BETTER IF THEY

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:14.762
REMAIN LOCAL. AND THAT IS

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:15.697
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:18.032
RETAIN. I'M TERMS THE TIMING

01:27:18.099 --> 01:27:19.601
AND THE LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSAL

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:22.403
ALLOWS- COMMITMENTS TO CONTINUE

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.238
THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THREE.

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:25.974
AND ARE SORT OF IN A WAIT AND

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.875
INTAKE AS OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:31.145
ONE- AND THEN SLOW ATTRITION

01:27:31.212 --> 01:27:32.547
OVER TIME. I THINK WE WANT TO

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:34.849
TALK ABOUT THE TINY AGAIN WELL

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:35.617
IT'S NOT FISCALLY DRIVEN THERE

01:27:35.683 --> 01:27:37.085
ARE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS OF

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:39.721
DOING THAT. AND WE ALSO THINK

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:42.657
IT'S REALLY. THAT WE- THAT. TO

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:45.326
AND I. IT'S THAT YOU. HAVE SIDE

01:27:45.393 --> 01:27:47.829
TODAY. I'M THEY HAVE ME GREAT

01:27:47.895 --> 01:27:51.432
REST LOCALLY. AND HOT ACHIEVE

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:53.468
REALLY GREAT OUTCOME AND WE

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:54.068
WANT TO CONTINUE THAT MOMENTUM

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:56.237
I'M- FOR THE- POPULATION IT

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:59.007
REMAINS TO THE STATE. I THINK.

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.308
THE OTHER THING THEY I. LIKE TO

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:01.776
CONTINUE TO. IS CREATION OF AN

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.845
INDEPENDENT. WITH HELP SERVICES

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:05.813
AGENCY. I'M THE ROLE OF THE

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:08.082
BOARD IT STINKS. SINCE THE PLOT

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:11.119
POINT. I'M AYE AND IS IT BAD

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:17.592
THAT. CONTEMPLATED IT HARPER.

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:18.192
SOMETHING THAT WE DO WANT TO

01:28:18.259 --> 01:28:19.060
TALK ABOUT FOR I THINK WE ARE

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:19.727
OPEN TO AND I OF YOUTH ADVOCATE

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:22.797
OFFICE AND OR SOME AN AUTUMN

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:24.766
MEN TYPE POSITION WITHIN THE

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:25.900
ADMINISTRATION AND THINK THAT

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.402
THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE CAN

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:28.202
PROBABLY FIND SOME COMMON

01:28:28.269 --> 01:28:30.838
GROUND- I THINK ANOTHER

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:33.174
CRITICAL PIECE FOR US IS HAVING

01:28:33.241 --> 01:28:36.344
IN- OPTIONS FOR THE JUDICIAL

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:39.681
COUNCIL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:28:39.747 --> 01:28:40.915
THAT THERE ARE. AND DIFFERENT

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:41.983
TYPES OF OPTIONS THOSE THAT

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.251
EXISTS NOW SO THAT WE DON'T

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:45.887
ENCOURAGE. MORE ADULT COURT

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:46.454
COMMITMENTS THAT'S SOMETHING

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:47.555
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:48.623
THEM IS KEY O OUR PROPOSAL ALL

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.725
ALONG- WE STARTED WHEN WE

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:53.027
PROPOSED MADE THE PROPOSAL. AT

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:55.563
A COST OF A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:56.164
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USE THAT

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:56.998
WOULD BE REALIGNED TO THE

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:59.267
LOCALS AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:02.603
AND WE INCREASED THAT TO TWO

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:03.171
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:04.706
DOLLARS FOR YOUTH. WITH A FLOOR

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:06.274
OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.676
DOLLARS FOR COUNTIES THAT HAD-

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.845
THAT WAS LOWER THAN WHATEVER

01:29:10.912 --> 01:29:12.880
THAT I HAD MATH AND THAT BE.

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:14.682
I'D SO I WANTED TO KNOW THAT I

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:16.784
THINK AND THERE IS ALSO A

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.419
COMMENT MADE ABOUT THE COST OF

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:20.088
OUR INCARCERATION AT THE STATE

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:22.457
LEVEL. OUR PER CAPITA COST IS

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:25.660
EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT TWO

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:26.260
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:27.729
DOLLARS. THIS COMING YEAR AND I

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:29.297
THINK LOCALLY THOSE THERE ARE

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:31.232
SOME VERY BIG VARIATIONS I

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:32.500
THINK ON THE HIGH END SANTA

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:33.968
CLARA IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:35.336
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOU. OTHER

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:37.205
KEY SMALL COUNTIES ARE ABOUT A

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:40.007
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. LA IS

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.809
CLOSER TO AROUND THREE HUNDRED

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.311
FIFTY THOUSAND SO I'M NOT I'M

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.546
NOT JUSTIFYING OUR COSTS BUT I

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:47.381
DO THINK WE DO HAVE VERY.

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:49.550
SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS BECAUSE

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:50.985
OF THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT WHICH WE

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.386
ARE NOW NO LONGER SUBJECT TO

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:55.456
BUT HAVE AGREED VARIOUS.

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.657
RELATIONS AND WE HOUSE ARE YOU.

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:57.458
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:59.393
AGREEMENTS I AND WE PROVIDE THE

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.828
TREATMENT SERVICES CONSISTENT

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:03.364
WITHOUT LAWSUIT SO. I DID JUST

01:30:03.431 --> 01:30:05.867
WANT TO NOTE THAT- I THINK THE

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:07.101
OTHER THING THAT WE DID WAS

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:08.836
RECOGNIZING THAT NOT ALL

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.404
COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:13.141
TO REPLICATE. OR AND OPERATE

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:15.476
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THOSE- THAT

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.645
ARE UNIQUE TO THE STATE LEVEL

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:18.713
SYSTEM LIKE THE SEX BEHAVIOR

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.981
TREATMENT PROGRAM THAT WAS

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:22.283
DISCUSSED EARLIER. WE DO WANT

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.884
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:23.885
INCENTIVE FOR COUNTIES TO

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:24.886
CREATE THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH IS

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:27.021
WHY WE ALSO ESTABLISHED. SOME

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:29.056
PLANNING MONEY WITHIN- THE

01:30:29.123 --> 01:30:29.891
BORDER STATE COMMUNITY

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:30.925
CORRECTIONS THAT WOULD BE

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:32.026
ALLOCATED TO COUNTIES FOR THAT

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.362
FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. I'M IN

DEVELOP THOSE PROGRAMS AND

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:40.034
SERVICES LOCALLY RECOGNIZING

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:40.735
THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:43.337
TO EXIST IN EACH COUNTY WE

01:30:43.404 --> 01:30:43.938
THOUGHT OUR REGIONAL APPROACH.

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:46.207
WOULD WORK AND THAT HAPPENS NOW

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:49.544
OUR CAPPIES THE CONTRACT OTHER.

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:52.213

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:37.945
LOOKING FOR IS. THE RIGHT KIND

01:33:38.012 --> 01:33:41.215
OF PROGRAMMING AND I THINK ONE

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:42.883
OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE NEED

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:45.920
TO ADDRESS IS THE NEED. TO

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:47.021
UPDATE SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:48.689
AND NOT JUST PARKING FACILITIES

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:50.324
BUT ACTUALLY SOFTENING.

01:33:50.391 --> 01:33:51.759
FACILITY SO THAT THEY CAN BE

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.661
MORE HOME LIKE THAT THEY CAN BE

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:55.429
MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE KINDS

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:58.099
OF PROGRAMMING. THAT THESE

01:33:58.165 --> 01:34:00.067
THESE YOUTH REALLY NEED SO

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:01.669
FORGET HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:02.603
PROGRAM I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:05.639
ADDRESS THE LACK OF FACILITIES

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.541
NEEDS IN IN JUST FOR EXAMPLE

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:08.676
CARRY THAT I COME OUT OF SANTA

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.544
CRUZ COUNTY. UNDER THE OLD C.

01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:12.913
Y. EIGHT DAYS CAN YOU REFUSE TO

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.216
SEND KIDS TO THE STATE BECAUSE

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:16.350
OF HOW BAD THINGS WERE. INSTEAD

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:17.151
OF THE SAME TYPE AND WORKED

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:19.920
VERY HARD TO DIVERT KIDS SO

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.122
THEY HAD A VERY SMALL

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:23.124
POPULATION. AT THE JUVENILE

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:24.892
HALL AND BECAUSE OF THAT WHEN

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:26.794
IT CAME TIME FOR FUNDING THEY

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:27.995
WERE ABLE TO GET FUNDING TO

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:29.263
UPDATE THEIR FACILITIES SO

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.631
THERE A LOT OF COUNTIES HAVE

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:31.465
BEEN DOING A LOT THE RIGHT

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:34.068
THING. OVER THE- INTERVENING

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:36.437
YEARS BUT BECAUSE OF HOW THE

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.039
CAPACITY LOOKS IN AND PREVIOUS

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.774
FUNDING DECISIONS THEY DON'T

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.375
HAVE THE RIGHT FACILITIES TO BE

01:34:41.442 --> 01:34:44.345
ABLE TO SERVE KIDS SO I THINK

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:45.980
WE NEED TO AS IN PARALLEL. WITH

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:47.114
THE EFFORT OF THIS REALIGNMENT

01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:49.517
IS REALLY LOOK AT THE CAPACITY

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:50.551
ACROSS THE STATE THE KINDS OF

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.153
FACILITIES THAT ARE THERE AND

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.688
SEE IF WE NEED TO BE PROVIDING

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:56.924
SOME UPDATES. TO THOSE CABINETS

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:58.859
THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEED TO BE

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:01.328
SPENT UP TO PROVIDE REGIONAL

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:05.099
SERVICES AS WE MOVE FOR WOOD

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:06.300
WITH. THIS PROPOSAL SO THAT'S

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:07.701
NOT NECESSARILY ADDRESSED HERE.

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:08.569
SO AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:10.871
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. IN PARALLEL

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:12.873
TO THIS IS REALLY LOOK AT WHAT

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.443
THE CAPACITY IS AT EACH COUNTY

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:16.677
INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING YOU HAVE

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:18.079
ADDITIONAL BEDS WE'RE GOING TO

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:18.946
MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE MORE

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:20.948
KIDS. THAT'S NOT FAIR TO THOSE

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:22.716
COUNTIES WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:23.984
ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:24.985
FORGET EXPECT THAT REGIONAL

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:26.554
APPROACH TO WORK WE'RE GOING TO

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.122
HAVE TO SUPPORT THOSE COUNTY IS

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:30.658
WILLING TO STEP UP. FOR THOSE

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:32.026
REGIONAL SERVICES AND HELP

01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:33.828
COUNTIES AROUND THE- YEAH. ANY

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:36.797
OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. JONES

SAWYER YES AND THANK YOU OUT OF

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.802
IT AND I HEARD HEARD A LOT

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:45.005
ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF THE

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:49.076
SYSTEMS WERE WORKING-

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:50.177
ACCOUNTABILITY WHETHER ON. ON

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:52.012
THE PROVISION SIDE OR OR THE

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:54.215
STATE SIDE ORDINATE COMMITTEE

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:57.351
BASE ORGANIZATIONS SITE UP WE

01:35:57.418 --> 01:35:59.053
WOULD BE MEETING HERE RIGHT NOW.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.287
IF THERE WERE IF PEOPLE HAVEN'T

01:36:00.354 --> 01:36:02.756
TRULY BEEN ACCOUNTABLE AND THE

01:36:02.823 --> 01:36:10.731
SUCCESS. AND SO I I'M I'M

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:12.533
ALWAYS WONDERING WHAT WHAT

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.835
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES ARE WE

01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:16.604
TALKING ABOUT. AND I USUALLY

01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:18.572
USED TO THINK THAT THE EXAMPLE

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:21.442
OF- WORKING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:23.010
WE GET REALLY PRIDEFUL ON WHAT

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:25.112
WE CALL WHICH IT SAID. WE GAVE

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:26.780
THIS PROGRAM WE GET THAT PART

01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:28.149
READING PROGRAMS IN THE CLASSIC

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:29.817
TIGHTEST SOCIAL WORKED ALL THIS

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:31.752
WILL BE AT THE FRONT END. AND

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:32.953
THEN WHEN YOU ASK THEM ABOUT

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.689
THEIR OUTCOMES YOU GET THIS

01:36:35.756 --> 01:36:39.160
KINDA MUMBLES- THE- MUMBLE

01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:41.896
JUMBLE AND I JUST REMEMBER IT

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:44.665
WAS A CAR COMPANY. THAT DID A

01:36:44.732 --> 01:36:46.667
LOT OF RESEARCH PUT IN A LOT OF

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.769
EFFORT ON DISCARDED THEY WERE

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:51.672
IN SELF TO LATINO COMMUNITY.

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:54.141
AND IT WORKED REALLY GREAT AND

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:57.211
THE IN A POLLING AND EVERYTHING

01:36:57.278 --> 01:36:57.745
THEN THEY PUT IT OUT INTO

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.346
MARKET. AND I CAN UNDERSTAND

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:02.416
WHY THE CARD DIDN'T SELL. DISK

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:04.418
LATINA JUST WOULD NOT BY THE

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:06.620
CAR. AND ONE DAY THEY WERE

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:08.489
TALKING TO SOMEONE IN ELECTION

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:10.357
OR IN UPPER MANAGEMENT AND HE

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:12.293
SAID WELL THE CAR'S NAME IS

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:15.329
NOVA. IN IN IN IN SPANISH NOVA

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:17.698
MEANS DON'T GO. WHY WOULD YOU

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.466
WANNA CARDUS SAYS WON'T RUN

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:22.303
WON'T GO. AND IS ONE OF THOSE

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:25.039
THINGS WHERE WE DO ALL THESE

01:37:25.105 --> 01:37:26.540
WONDERFUL THINGS IN THE FRONT

01:37:26.607 --> 01:37:28.142
END AND THEN WHEN YOU ASK FOR

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:30.277
ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE BACK IN-

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:31.845
YOU DON'T GET A WHOLE YOU DON'T

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:33.314
KNOW WHAT THAT IS SO AND SO

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.616
WHEN I WHEN SOMEONE SAYS WE

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:36.984
SPENT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:40.854
DOLLARS FOR KIDS A THREE

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:41.388
HUNDRED TO SEVENTY FIVE OR

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:42.256
WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS I NEED

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:44.625
TO TAXPAYERS. TO KNOW. WHAT

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.894
BANG FOR THE BUCK DID THEY GET.

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:48.596
AND SO I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:53.968
KNOW- FOR BOTH SIDES REALLY.

01:37:54.034 --> 01:37:55.436
DID YOU SET UP ACCOUNTABILITY

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:57.438
MEASURES RESET THE OUTCOMES

01:37:57.504 --> 01:37:58.939
THESE WERE THESE ARE GOALS

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:00.674
THESE ARE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:02.810
FOR AND IN THE OUTCOMES ARE

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:04.345
GOING TO BE A. B. C. INDEED IF

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:06.146
YOU DON'T REACH THOSE. DO YOU

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:10.851
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR BUDGET

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:11.352
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:11.986
PROGRAM DO YOU MAKE IT JUST. OR

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:13.988
DO YOU JUST TO KEEP DOING THAT

01:38:14.054 --> 01:38:15.756
AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:18.058
RESULT. OF WHAT WE CALL PEOPLE

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:19.793
WHO DO THAT AND SO THAT'S

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:21.161
THAT'S WHAT REALLY REALLY

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:23.063
DRIVES ME CRAZY I DO NOT I'M

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:25.799
NOT FIGHTING OVER. WHO GETS THE

01:38:25.866 --> 01:38:29.169
MONEY UP FIGHTING OVER WHO BEST.

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:31.839
GET THE MONEY. IT 1100% OF IT

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:33.574
WENT TO PROBATION AND LAW

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:35.342
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEY DID A-

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:37.678
THEY DID THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.246
INTERESSES MINIMUM RATE WAS

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:41.348
DOWN ALMOST TO ZERO. THEN WE

01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:43.183
NEED TO GIVE EVERY DIME TO

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:45.286
THEM. BUT IF IT ISN'T IF IT IS

01:38:45.352 --> 01:38:46.954
THE CBO'S AND THEY'RE DOING THE

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:48.956
BEST JOB POSSIBLE DO WE NEED TO

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:50.257
GIVE IT TO THEM OR IS IT A

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:52.059
HYBRID OF THAT. AND IT SHOULD

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:53.861
BE BASED ON THE SUCCESS RATE OF

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:56.764
THEIR- KIDS. NOT ON PEOPLE

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:57.765
BUILDING AS SOMEONE SAID

01:38:57.831 --> 01:38:59.166
BUILDING BUREAUCRACIES ARE

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:01.502
BUILDING NEW BUREAUCRACIES. AND

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:04.738
SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT. I

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.440
CAN BACK INTO WHAT MEASURES OF

01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:09.176
SUCCESS. ARE THEY USING. WHEN

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:12.479
IT FROM. BOTH SIDES- OUT TO

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:15.649
COMMUNITY OR WITHIN- WITHIN

01:39:15.716 --> 01:39:17.151
WITHIN GOVERNMENT. WHAT ARE

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:18.786
THOSE MEASURES OF SUCCESS

01:39:18.852 --> 01:39:20.621
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR A WHOLE

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:22.623
LOT OF THAT. IN ALL OF THIS

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:25.192
DISCUSSION AND I THINK THAT'S

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:25.726
PROBABLY THE MOST CRITICAL

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:28.162
THING. ANYONE ELSE SEVENTY

01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:30.964
QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS

01:39:31.031 --> 01:39:33.534
OR QUESTIONS I THINK YOU RAISE

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.035
SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES EVERYONE

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.103
HAS RAISED SOME IMPORTANT

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:39.206
ISSUES AND- AND AS WE'VE SEEN

01:39:39.273 --> 01:39:41.141
THE NUMBERS GO FROM TEN

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:42.543
THOUSAND DOWN TO EIGHT HUNDRED

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:44.812
AND- YOU KNOW WE CAN. PROBABLY

01:39:44.878 --> 01:39:46.213
STAND UP AND TAKE A BOW WE

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.082
THINK WE CAN BUT WE HAVE TO

01:39:48.148 --> 01:39:49.083
REALIZE THE EXTERNAL PRESSURES

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:50.851
THAT BROUGHT US TO THAT EIGHT

01:39:50.918 --> 01:39:51.852
HUNDRED THAT IT MAY NOT HAVE

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:53.687
BEEN BECAUSE WE HAVE DEVELOPED

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:55.522
SUCH A GREAT SYSTEM TO REDUCE

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:56.056
IT TO THAT LEVEL THAT WHAT

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:58.759
NUMBER OF ALL- CHALLENGES AND

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:00.794
OVERSIGHTS AND YOU KNOW LEGAL

01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:02.129
THINGS AND WHAT HAVE YOU THAT

01:40:02.196 --> 01:40:03.630
MADE US AND AS WE DO EVEN WITH

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.899
OUR- OWN OF PRISON SYSTEM THAT

01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:07.634
WE'VE- HAD REDUCE NUMBERS. YOU

01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:09.103
KNOW AND THAT KIND OF THING AND

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:10.537
SELF SO THAT BRINGS US TO THAT

01:40:10.604 --> 01:40:12.573
BIG CONCERN I THINK WE HAVE

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:15.676
SEEN- AND I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:17.611
UNDERSTAND RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:18.612
SEEN AS AS I SAW HERE THE

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:19.780
NUMBERS THE TREMENDOUS

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:22.816
DISPARITY BETWEEN. THE COST

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:23.384
THAT'S THERE AND I THINK THE

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:24.551
PUBLIC NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND IT

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:25.352
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:27.788
DISPARITY BETWEEN THE COST- YOU

01:40:27.855 --> 01:40:30.691
KNOW- WHEN I FIRST GOT INVOLVED

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:32.059
OF WODEHOUSE FIRST ON THIS

01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:33.227
COMMITTEE I THINK THE COST WAS

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:35.229
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:35.796
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PER

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:37.131
CHILD. NOW IT TOO CLOSE TO

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:39.433
SOMEONE SAID FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.535
MUCH OF IT HAS NOT AND MOST OF

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:43.003
IT IS NOT TO DO WITH THE FACT

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:44.638
THAT WE'VE INCREASED SERVICES

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.473
AND OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IS

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.908
THAT WE ARE FUNDING THESE

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:50.511
FACILITIES- AND THESE-

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:51.879
INSTITUTIONS OF THESE BUILDINGS

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:54.415
AND THE STAFF THAT'S THERE. AND

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:55.816
YET WE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:57.584
INCREASING THE SERVICES AS WE

01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:59.720
IS ONE WOULD THINK AND SELL- SO

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:00.988
THAT THAT HAD ME SOMEWHAT

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:03.190
CONCERNED BECAUSE I FELT IT TWO

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:04.825
AND A FIFTY THOUSAND I COULD

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:06.226
PROBABLY DO A BETTER JOB WITH

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:09.062
HELPING FAMILIES AT PROVIDING

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:10.364
STABILITY IN COUNSELING FOR THE

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:13.100
FAMILY SO THE KIDS COULD BE

01:41:13.167 --> 01:41:16.036
BETTER OFF SERVING. AND THAT'S

01:41:16.103 --> 01:41:20.908
IT I'M GOING ON GOAL WHICH WILL

01:41:20.974 --> 01:41:26.947
CHANGE THE SENATE WE ARE.

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:29.016
RECOGNIZE THE CAR OF. WHEN I

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:31.985

01:41:32.052 --> 01:41:33.554
TO HAVE THE T RESOURCES THAT

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.189
AND THAT AND THAT BECOMES. UP

01:41:35.255 --> 01:41:35.789
SOME OF THE CHEESE MAY BE ABLE

01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:36.423
TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE WE HAVE

01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:37.391

ANTICIPATE FOR THE NEXT THIRTY.

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:23.290
YEARS SO WHEN WE'RE OF

COMMENTS ABOUT THE OVER NOW.

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:28.061
AND SAY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:44:28.128 --> 01:44:29.863
COULD PASS A AND- BECAUSE THERE

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:31.698
ARE LOW. AVERAGE DAILY

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.867

MORE HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENTS

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:53.620
WITHIN THE CONFINES OF

STRUCTURES THEY HAD. THAT SAID

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:58.892
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC IF PART

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:02.362
OF THE SOLUTION- PERFORM GOING

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:04.297
FORWARD FROM HERE WAS TO

01:45:04.364 --> 01:45:06.133

01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:11.338
AND MORTAR FACILITIES THAT- IF

01:45:11.405 --> 01:45:12.606
GIVEN THAT THE RIGHT TECH

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:14.541

OF THE TRIPS WE KNOW WHAT WE

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:28.288
WANT ONE OUT- HAVING THE LOCAL

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:29.890
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO INVEST.

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:33.060
INTO A STRUCTURE WHERE THERE

01:45:33.126 --> 01:45:34.995
ARE ONLY A FEW KIDS UP THE HARD

01:45:35.062 --> 01:45:36.630
ARGUMENT TO MAKE LOCALLY WHEN

THAT- I KNOW COUNTIES WOULD BE

01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:56.483

SOMEONE ELSE ON HE WAS NOT OKAY

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:11.264
SURE IT'S BRINGING WITH

01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:13.734
NATIONAL CENTER THOUGHT TO RISK

02:03:57.663 --> 02:03:59.665
RESULT AND- CHANGING PROGRAM

02:03:59.732 --> 02:04:00.900
SOMETIMES CHANGE IN STAFFING

02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:02.701
CHANGE AND FOCUS AND ALL THOSE

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:05.838
KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN WHEN

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:06.405
YOU. ACTUALLY DO A DEEP DIVE

02:04:06.472 --> 02:04:08.374
AND YOU REALLY WANT TO CHANGE

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.408
AN AGENT SO. I CAN UNDERSTAND

02:04:09.475 --> 02:04:10.709
THE ANGST AND THE CONCERN OF

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:11.811
THOSE WHO CURRENTLY WORK IN THE

02:04:11.877 --> 02:04:12.978
SYSTEM IS WHERE WHERE THEY FIT

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:14.814
IN. HOPEFULLY THEIR INPUT IN

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:15.748
THE BEST THAT THEY HAVE TO

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:16.949
BRING WILL BE UTILIZED IN THE

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:18.617
PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

02:04:18.684 --> 02:04:20.186
WHAT THE NEW JUVENILE SYSTEM A

02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:21.687
SYSTEM WILL LOOK LIKE. I THINK

02:04:21.754 --> 02:04:23.022
WE ALL AGREE ON THE ON THE

02:04:23.088 --> 02:04:24.356
BASIC ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:25.391
HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY WE

02:04:25.457 --> 02:04:27.159
WANT SOME CONSISTENCY. SOME

02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:28.661
SERVICES PROVIDED FOR STUDENTS

02:04:28.727 --> 02:04:30.462
AS YOUNG PEOPLE I JUST KEEP

02:04:30.529 --> 02:04:31.997
SAYING STUDENTS THAT'S MY-

02:04:32.064 --> 02:04:33.899
CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE BUT UP.

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:35.267
AND THEY ARE STUDENTS MOST OF

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:38.070
THESE FOLKS ARE STUDENTS AND IT

02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:39.505
WILL CONSISTENCY IN SERVICES

02:04:39.572 --> 02:04:40.840
THAT ARE PROVIDED ACROSS THE

02:04:40.906 --> 02:04:42.341
STATE SO THAT AS WE SAID BEFORE

02:04:42.408 --> 02:04:43.876
GEOGRAPHY WILL NOT DETERMINE

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:45.978
YOUR SUCCESS. IN OUR JUVENILE

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:51.250
SYSTEM BUT. WE ALSO WANT

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:51.851
RECOGNIZE THAT WE WANT TO GET

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:52.451
TO POINT WILL BE ARE MAY A- IN

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:53.085
A LOT OF YOUNG. SO THAT THERE

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:54.620
IS NO TO ANY OTHER KIND OF

02:04:54.687 --> 02:04:55.988
JUVENILE SYSTEM WE'VE REDUCED

02:04:56.055 --> 02:04:57.289
OUR POPULATION BUT WE KNOW WE

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:58.490
NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB IN THE

02:04:58.557 --> 02:04:59.959
PROCESS OF THAT. AND WE'RE

02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:01.460
LOOKING FOR WAYS THAT THAT

02:05:01.527 --> 02:05:02.595
MAKES IT BETTER IN TERMS OF

02:05:02.661 --> 02:05:04.630
WHAT TO DO- AND WE HAVE NOT

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:06.098
THUS FAR IDENTIFIED ONE SIZE

02:05:06.165 --> 02:05:07.233
FIT ALL WE KNOW THAT EACH

02:05:07.299 --> 02:05:08.200
COUNTY IS GOING TO HAVE A

02:05:08.267 --> 02:05:10.135
DIFFERENT CHALLENGE. AND HAS

02:05:10.202 --> 02:05:11.670
AND HAS DIFFERENT FACILITIES

02:05:11.737 --> 02:05:12.972
AND RESOURCES THAT NEED TO BE

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:16.642
UTILIZED BUT THE OUTCOME SHOULD

02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:17.243
BE THE SAME THE KID SHOULD BE

02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:18.310
BETTER AS A- OF HAVING. TO THAT

02:05:18.377 --> 02:05:20.079
SYSTEM AND THEY SHOULD BE GOING

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:21.647
OUT AS PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS WERE

02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:24.216
ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR LIVES AND

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:26.318
BE A CREDIT TO THEIR COMMUNITY

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:27.753
AND THEIR FAMILIES- AT FAMILIES

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:31.423
COULD BE. AS A ALSO THE PEOPLE.

02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:33.292
BROUGHT IT TO THAT. THANK WILL

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:35.094
THOSE BE ISSUE THAT ARE THERE

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:35.928
ARE GETTING TO THE DETAILS

02:05:35.995 --> 02:05:38.197
GOING TO BE MOST AND PART I

02:05:38.264 --> 02:05:41.066
THINK THIS COMMITTEE IS COMING

02:05:41.133 --> 02:05:41.567
TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE

02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:47.006
LEGISLATURE IN HAVE A ROLE IN

02:05:47.072 --> 02:05:47.640
MAKING AND- THAT THE OVERSIGHT.

02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:48.207
IS THERE. AND THEN WE HAVE A

02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:48.841
COUPLE. TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:49.441
AND HAVE A CO. IN MAKING THE

02:05:49.508 --> 02:05:50.109
OUTCOME. OR PROVIDED FOR US SO

02:05:50.175 --> 02:05:50.976
THAT WE FEEL. THAT WE KNOW THE

02:05:51.043 --> 02:05:52.177
RESOURCES THAT WE'RE PUTTING

02:05:52.244 --> 02:05:53.479
INTO IT ACTUALLY MATTERS WE

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:55.080
HAVE NOT. A NONE OF US HAVE

02:05:55.147 --> 02:05:56.115
SAID THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT

YOU HAVE AN ONLY THAT IN TERMS

02:05:57.917 --> 02:05:59.618
OF WHAT. RESOURCES NEED TO BE

02:05:59.685 --> 02:06:00.519
THERE AND SO IS NOT ABOUT

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:02.621
CUTTING COST. AT IT'S ABOUT

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:04.456
BASICALLY CUTTING WASTE SURELY.

02:06:04.523 --> 02:06:05.724
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT SAVING

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:06.592
LIVES AND I THINK THAT'S OUR

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:08.527
MAIN FOCUS- AND FOR THESE YOUNG

THIS MOMENT. WILL DETERMINE

02:06:12.998 --> 02:06:13.999
WHAT THEY WILL DO FOR THE REST

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:15.367
OF THEIR LIVES AND WHAT THE

02:06:15.434 --> 02:06:16.368
