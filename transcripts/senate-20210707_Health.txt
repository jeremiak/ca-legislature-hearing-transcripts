THANK YOU GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU- MEMBERS I WOULD START BY SAYING THAT IT WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY TO THE COMMITTEE WHICH WILL ADDRESS MAJOR BIO SECURITY CONCERNS WITHIN THE GENE SYNTHESIS INDUSTRY. A. B. SEVENTY WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC SAFETY SCREENING GUIDELINES. ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED BY GENE SYNTHESIS COMPANIES WHO SELL. MANUFACTURE DNA ONLINE. JUST LAST YEAR SCIENTISTS HAVE SHOWN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT VIRUSES LIKE COVE IN NINETEEN. AND EVEN WORSE DISEASES LIKE EBOLA. BY USING MAIL ORDER DNA THAT CAN BE PURCHASED THROUGH THE INTERNET FROM GENE SYNTHESIS COMPANIES. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS OF GENE SYNTHESIS NEED TO SCREEN THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND THEIR ORDERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT CRIMINALS WHO MIGHT BE PURCHASING THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A DEADLY PATHOGEN. AB SEVENTY- WITH AB SEVENTY CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE FIRST STATE TO ESTABLISH A SET OF BEST PRACTICES WITHIN THE GENE SYNTHESIS INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT THE BAD ACTORS CANNOT ASSEMBLE DANGEROUS DISEASES. FROM PRODUCTS SOLD BY COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN OUR STATE. THIS BILL IS A COMMONSENSE. SAFETY MEASURES THAT HAVE SUPPORT FROM BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND THE GENE SYNTHESIS INDUSTRY AS THIS BILL HAS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION WITH ME TODAY BY PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS DOCTOR GIGI GROVEL A SENIOR SCHOLAR AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS CENTER FOR HEALTH SECURITY. AND AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ENGINEERING. AT THE JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ALSO ON THE LINE TO HAVE AARON SMITH SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT TWIST BIOSCIENCE A GENE SYNTHESIS. COMPANY OPERATING IN SAN FRANCISCO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A MEMBER AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE WHAT WHAT THE COMEDIAN TAKING THE AMENDMENTS WILL NOW- MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE OR TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT A DOCTOR GIGI GROUNDBALL FROM JOHNS HOPKINS CENTER FOR. HEALTH SECURITY AND ERIN SMITH FROM PUBLIC POLICY TWIST BIOSCIENCE BEGIN WITH. DOCTOR GIGI GROWN OF ALL YOU HAVE TO MINUTES- TO GO OVER I'LL GIVE YOU THE TWO MINUTE WARNING BUT THEN THAT WILL COME OUT THE TIME THAT THE SUBSEQUENT SPEAKER. SO PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING BY SECURITY CONCERNS ABOUT GENE SYNTHESIS WITH THE SPELL IT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER MY SUPPORT- MY NAME IS JUDY GROUND BALL AND MY BACKGROUND. IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND I SERVE ON FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR AN AGENCY- T. ON EMERGING BIOTECH AND SECURITY. I'VE ALSO SERVED AS A COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORT ON BIODEFENSE IN EGYPT BACKGROUND G. WE CONCLUDED THAT ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING BY A SECURITY RISK. WE FACE IS THAT A BAD ACTOR USE GENE SYNTHESIS PRODUCTS TO MAKE PATHOGENS PARTICULARLY SMALL VIRUSES. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE BACK HE SAID THAT HIS COMPANY'S CLEANER ORDERS. AND THAT CUSTOMERS ONLY USE COMPANIES THAT PERFORMED BY A- BY A SECURITY SCREENING. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR NEFARIOUS ACTORS ACCESS NOW TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T NEED IT T MAKE VIRUSES LIKE SMALLPOX A BOWL OR INFLUENCE THAT. THE ON GOING COPING NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE SOCIETY AFFLICTED BY A HEALTH SECURITY CRISIS. THIS BILL CAN HELP TO MAKE THE FIELD LOOKING PANICKY IN A SAFER. AND ENSURE RESPONSIBLE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES WITHOUT LIMITING IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. MANY COMMERCIAL GENE SYNTHESIS COMPANIES ALREADY VOLUNTARILY SCREEN CUSTOMER ORDERS BUT IT'S BACK ON TIME AND MONEY. THOSE RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN AT A COMPETITIVE BUSINESS DISADVANTAGE. THIS LEGISLATION LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT ONLY HIGH UALITY ORGANIZATIONS TAKE PART IN THE EMERGING BIOTECH FIELD. IT'S MY HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY FOR THE U. S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO PUT REGULATIONS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT DNA SEQUENCES OF PATHOGENS. DO NOT FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR INCLUDING ME HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP TO GUARD. AGAINST THE THREAT. THANK YOU THAT'S A MOVE ON EARN SOME. FROM TWIST BY US PLEASE BEGIN.

CRITICALLY HE PLANS FOR GOOD AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLATFORMS FOR GOOD ARE USED THAT WAY. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A CONTINUED RESOURCE AND WORKING WITH.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND FURTHER RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS AND I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ON AB THREE FORTY SEVEN A BILL DESIGNED TO TREAT PATIENTS AS UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS. THANKS TO MORE QUICKLY PRESCRIBE MEDICATION EFFECTIVE FOR THEIR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. CURRENT UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT IS THE PRIMARY SYSTEM IN PLACE TO GUIDE PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS AND INCLUDES BOTH PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND STEP THERAPY. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION ALLOWS INSURERS TO DENY COVERAGE OF SPECIFIC MEDICATIONS AND STEP THERAPY ALLOWS INSURERS TO DESIGN TREATMENT REGIMENS WHICH RELY ON A FAILED FIRST APPROACH STEPPING THROUGH ALTERNATE MEDICATIONS BEFORE LANDING AT THE RIGHT MEDICATION. COUCHED AS A COST SAVINGS MEASURE THIS SYSTEM TAKES US FURTHER FROM THE IDEAL APPROACH OF INDIVIDUALIZED TAILORED MEDICINE. EIGHTY THREE FORTY SEVEN MOVES US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND EMPOWERS PHYSICIANS TO IMMEDIATELY CONNECT PATIENTS TO THE RIGHT MEDICATIONS GIVEN THEIR MEDICAL HISTORY AND DISTINCT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. TO DO SO THIS BILL CREATES A PATHWAY FOR STEP THERAPY EXCEPTIONS AND IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS WHERE AN EXCEPTION TO STEP THERAPY COULD BE REQUESTED. FURTHER EIGHTY THREE FORTY SEVEN CREATE A FRAMEWORK THROUGH WHICH EXCEPTIONS ARE EVALUATED AND DECISIONS CONVEYED TO THE PHYSICIAN OR PRESCRIBER. FINALLY THIS BILL ENSURES THAT APPEALS AND REVIEWS OF EXCEPTION DENIALS ARE CONDUCTED BY PROFESSIONALS IN THE SIMILAR FIELD WHO CAN PROPERLY EVALUATE THE CASE. SIMILAR EXEMPTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN MORE THAN TWENTY STATES BUT TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT STEP THERAPY OR USE OF GENERICS. RATHER IT ESTABLISHES A STANDARD TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR PHYSICIANS TO EVALUATE THE PATIENT'S CIRCUMSTANCES IDENTIFY IF AN EXTENSION COULD APPLY AND REDUCE HARM BY IMMEDIATELY PRESCRIBING THE BEST MEDICINE FOR THE PATIENT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND I'M JOINED TODAY BY JENNIFER APPEL A GRAND DR SAMI MATTEL YES. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH SENATOR RANDALL AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF- EIGHTY THREE FORTY SEVEN- SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH.

THAT THE BABY IS MANDATED FOR PATIENTS CONDITION EVEN IF THAT PEACE AND PRIDE AND FEELS THE MEDICATION BEFORE WITH OTHER INSURANCE. THIS PROCESS IS LENGTHY AND EXHAUSTING.

WILL BEGIN WITH- NICOLAS LOUISE AS- HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- NICKEL RESULTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS- WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND- WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. THE SPONSOR. ON ANY COMMITTEE FOR THE OPEN LINE OF DIALOGUE ON THIS BILL- A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OR WILL BE TAKEN SOME OF WHICH IMPROVED THE BILL BUT WE STILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH EIGHTY THREE FORTY SEVEN WHEN IT WAS INTRODUCED IS THAT IT. ENCOURAGES THE UTILIZATION OF MORE EXPENSIVE AND RISK YOUR BRAND NAME DRUGS. AND IS ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME ON PLANS AND PROVIDERS WITH THOSE BURDENS OUTWEIGHING. MEMBERS HELP WHEN YOU STEP THERAPY FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO CONTROL HEALTHCARE COSTS. ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY AND ENCOURAGES PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS TO UNDERTAKE A MORE EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH TO TREATMENT. FOR POTENTIALLY- MORE ADDICTIVE THAN RISKIER DRUGS IT WAS A DAY THAT ARE COMMONLY ABUSED. ON HEALTH POINT AND IMPROVE INFLUENCE THAT THERAPY PROTOCOLS AS A WAY TO MAXIMIZE TREATMENT AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT WHILE REDUCING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OVER MEDICATION. ABUSE AND ADDICTION WE ARE ALWAYS CONCERNED THE LEGISLATION ALLOWS PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS SKIP PASSES CAREFUL APPROACHING THE STREETS THE USE OF RISK YOUR DRUGS. HAVING SAID THIS OUR MEMBERS DO NOT OPPOSE THE CONCEPT BEHIND THIS MA'AM MEASURE. AS DRAFTED HOWEVER IT IS STILL PLACES OVERLY BROAD RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF STEP THERAPY. RESULTING IN HIGHER UTILIZATION MORE COSTLY AND RISK YOUR BRAND NAME DRUGS OVER SAFER AND LOWER COST ALTERNATIVES- WE MUST ALSO KNOW THAT EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS ALREADY PROTECT CONSUMERS BY ALLOWING ENROLLEES OR OTHER PROVIDERS. TO REQUEST AN EXCEPTION TO HELP PLAN STEP THERAPY PROTOCOLS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I'M A DESPITE PRIOR TESTIMONY TODAY THERE ARE TIME LINE SAY IN LAW. I'M IN A SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKING IMPROVE THE BILL- WE VERY RECENTLY RECEIVED THEIR ORIGIN THAT IS PROPOSED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND WE WILL RESCUE ONE RESPONSE THE AUTHORS SPONSORING COMMITTEE. ONCE WE GET MORE FEEDBACK FROM OUR MEMBERS. ONE OUTSTANDING ISSUE IS THE INSISTENCE IN THE BILL TO USE CLINICAL HERE. TO REVIEW STEP THERAPY OVERRIDE OPINION IF THEY ARE DENIED TO MINIMIZE IT SOUNDS REASONABLE ON PAPER. WHAT SHOULD THANK YOU- THE WAY THAT THIS TERM IS DEFINED AS A REASONABLE WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL AND COSTLY TO IMPLEMENT. WE'VE OFFERED OFFERED AN ALTERNATIVE WITH THE BASIS IN EXISTING PRACTICING LAW. AND WE JUST HAVE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE MOVING FORWARD FOR NOW WE REMAIN OPPOSED THE LESS- FURTHER AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN THANK YOU MR. THANKS VERY MUCH. THE BRING ON STAFF- WHAT CAN.

I'M NOT SURE I CAN SPEAK FOR THE OPPOSITION TO EXPLAIN THEIR POINT MAYBE I CAN SPEAK TOWARDS THE NEED FOR US TO MAKE THE CHANGES TO STEP THERE WOULD BE GREAT SO FOR TOO MANY PATIENTS THEY HAVE DELAYS AND MEDICATIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT AND THE STEP THERAPY.

THE BILL NEXT WEEK AND WILL OF COURSE SOMEONE SURE THE COMMITTEE HAS BEFORE THEM THE FULL AMENDMENTS UP PRIOR TO THAT BOAT- SO WITH THAT- WELCOME CENTER COME LONGER- PLEASE EGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND I FOR JUST WANNA- THANK YOU PUBLICLY FOR ALL OF THE HELP THAT YOU HAVE- OFFERED IN MAKING THIS- STILL A STRONGER- YOU AND YOUR STAFF. IS A GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO ASK HERE I MOVED ON AB THREE SIX NINE THE STREET MEDICINE ACT. WHICH EXPANDS ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW ONE MOTHER'S DAY I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF. MEETING A HOMELESS FAMILY THAT IS IN MY DISTRICT A WOMAN KIANA HER HUSBAND AND THEIR THREE CHILDREN AND- THEY SAT IN THEIR HOUSE. WHICH WAS ALSO THEIR BROKEN DOWN SCV. AND TALK TO ME ABOUT ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE TRYING TO FIND HOUSING AND ALSO TRYING TO FIND HEALTH CARE. AND HOW THEY ARE BUMPED FROM ORGANIZATION TO ORGANIZATION FILLING OUT APPLICATION AFTER APPLICATION. AND GETTING NO SERVICES. HE HANNAH AND HER FAMILY- ARE ONE OF HE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PLUS. HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS IN LA COUNTY A 13% JUMP. FROM TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT'S MORE THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN THE COUNTRY. BUT LA IS NOT THE ONLY COUNTY SUFFERING FROM THIS CRISIS IT'S IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. IN CALIFORNIA CONTAINS HALF OF ALL THE HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW KIANA AND HER FAMILY BECAUSE THEY ARE HOMELESS HAVE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND FLUID NEEDS AND THEY HAVE LESS ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES. CAN I WAS TRYING TO GET PREGNANT SHE AND CHALLENGES WITH THAT SHE NEEDED POSTNATAL CARE SHE HAS THREE YOUNG CHILDREN OF VARYING AGES NONE OF THEM. GET ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BECAUSE OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. MANY OF THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ARE INSURED THROUGH MEDI CAL HELLO ALL HOWEVER EVEN WHEN INSURED 73% HAVE NEVER SEEN A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR WHEN THEY DO SEE SOMEONE. THEY ARE TURNED AWAY BECAUSE OF BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS. STARTING WITH THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS WHEN YOU ENROLL IN MEDICARE ALL YOUR INSURANCE CARD WITH THE NAME OF YOUR SIGN PROVIDER IS MAILED TO YOUR HOME ADDRESS HAHA IF YOU'RE HOMELESS WHAT IS THAT ADDRESS. EVEN IF YOU'RE LUCKY TO FIND OUT WHO YOUR DOCTOR IS. MANY ARE RELUCTANT. TO LEAVE ALL OF THEIR BELONGINGS AND THEIR PRO. ON FOR OR BEHIND. WITH NO WAY TRANCE THEM TO THE- WHEN THEY GO TO THE VESSEL. DEALING WITH THE ANXIETY OR THIS. OF HAVING TO WAIT AND SHOW WHAT I THAT MAY NOT HAVE OR SHARE PERSONAL MEDICAL HISTORY THAT YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER. AND FINALLY IF AN ID CARD IS STOLEN OR EVEN TRADED. MANY LACK ANY FORM OF OTHER IDENTIFICATION AND ARE THUS THUS TONIGHT ALL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES THAT WOULD BE COULD BE COVERED BY MEDI CAL. AND SO THEN WITHOUT ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE YOU ALL KNOW THE STORY. THE IN HOUSE POPULATION OVER UTILIZE EMERGENCY ROOMS WHERE THEY OFTEN ARE PRESENTED WITH MULTIPLE ADVANCED CONDITIONS WHICH LEADS TO INCREASED RATES OF HOSPITALIZATION AND RE ADMISSION AND THAT IS IF THEY SHOW UP. SO THE MAINSTREAM HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODELS DO NOT FIT THE REALITY OF THE STREETS. AND IF WE ARE GOING TO REALLY HELP THEN WE NEED TO RE ENGINEER PORTIONS OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE WHERE THEY ARE. WHEREVER THEY ARE AND WHENEVER THEY ARE IN THOSE PLACES AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS HAPPENING THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE STREET MEDICINE TEAMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DOING JUST THAT. BUT THESE PROGRAMS THESE TEAMS ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED THROUGH PRIVATE GRANTS BUT THEY PROVIDE MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL CARE TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN ROME AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE WITH HOUSING TRANSITIONS IN FACT IN LA COUNTY ALONE. WHEN ON HOUSE POPULATIONS ARE WORKING TO GET HOW PLACEMENT TO HOUSING TO LHASA. IT'S AT A 6% SUCCESS RATE WHEN THEY WERE TO GET HOUSING THROUGH THE STREET MEDICINE TEAMS AND SET A 42% SUCCESS RATE. ALL OF THIS CARE IS PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE IT IS DELIVERED ON SITE INCLUDING DISPENSING MEDICATIONS DRAWING BLOOD FOR TESTING THE PATIENTS DON'T HAVE TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS FIND TRANSPORTATION TO THE CLINIC PICK UP PRESCRIPTIONS OR PAY FOR THEIR TREATMENT. THEY ARE REFERRED TO A SPECIALTY OF SPECIALISTS THEY ARE TAKEN RIGHT THERE IMMEDIATELY THE BARRIERS THAT MAKE HOMELESS PEOPLE MUCH STICKIER ARE REMOVED SO THAT HEALTH CARE CAN BE ADMINISTERED A CUTE AND ON GOING. BY PROVIDING CONSISTENT PRIMARY CARE TO THE HOMELESS THESE PROGRAMS HAVE SHOWN TO REDUCE AVOIDABLE EXPENSIVE HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS BY TWO THIRDS RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. BUT DESPITE THESE BENEFITS MEDICARE CURRENTLY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR PROVIDERS TO TREAT PATIENTS ON THE STREETS SO A. B. THREE SIX NINE. GETTING TO THE JUICE OF IT ALL RECOGNIZES THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR HOME HOUSE POPULATION BY EXTENDING MEDI CAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY TO THE HOMELESS FOR MOVING ID CARD REQUIREMENTS FOR RECEIVING CARE. ALLOWING ON HOUSE PATIENTS TO RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL BENEFITS OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF A TRADITIONAL MEDICAL CLINIC. I'M PROUD THAT WE'VE RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IN COMMITTEES AND ON THE FLOOR IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE GROUP IN OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW A LOT MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY FOLKS WERE AND HOUSED- WHO ARE LIVING IN CAMPS IN ON THE STREETS EVERY DAY. LAST MONTH WHEN THIS WAS HEARD IN THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE WHEN IT PASSED OFF THE FLOOR WE WERE TOLD. THAT THERE WAS AN ENCAMPMENT THAT WAS BEING ADMINISTERED TO TREAT MEDICINE AND THEY ALL STOPPED AND CHEERED. AND THEY'RE LISTENING TODAY. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS BRETT FELDMAN WITH THE STREET MEDICINE INSTITUTE AND DR MATT MARY MURPHY C. WITH THE UCLA DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE. THANK YOU SO MUCH ERICA MARKERS MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE BRETT FELDMAN FROM THE USC DEPARTMENT FAMILY MEDICINE AT ST MEDICINE INSTITUTE AND DR MARY MARTHA C. FROM THE CLI DEPARTMENT FAMILY MEDICINE WILL BEGIN WITH BRETT FELDMAN YOU HAVE. TWO MINUTES. TO INTERVIEW FOUR MINUTES. UP PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU TO A DOCTOR AND COMMUNITY ACCOUNT SENATOR TOM LONGER INSTRUMENTAL CAN WE GO TO THE PEOPLE FIRST TO DELIVER A TENDER LOVE. AND THEN THE SAME QUALITY HEALTHCARE ON THE TREE THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IN A BRICK AND MORTAR CLINIC. AFTER SPENDING THE PAST. FOURTEEN YEARS UNDER FREEWAYS AND RIVERS. PERFECT AT. THEIR REALITY I'VE LEARNED THAT PART OF THE REALITY IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY. AND MEDICAL ACTOR A GAP THAT D. D. THREE SIX NINE WILL CLOSE. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE'S NO CLEAR MECHANISM TO REIMBURSE FOR THREE MINUTES AND- NOT BECAUSE OF THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE DELIVERING A BECAUSE OF.THE LOCATION WHERE SHE DELIVERED. EIGHT THREE SIX NINE RECOGNIZED BY ALLOWING HER TO TAKE IT AS WELL I MEAN SHE MET HIM AND HE REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES. WHICH ARE ALREADY REIMBURSABLE BY RECOGNIZING THE NECESSITY TO PRACTICE OUTSIDE FOUR WALLS SHE OTHER IMPORTANT RESULT OF THE P. THREE SIX NINE AND ALLOWING PATIENTS DIRECT ACCESSSTREET MEDICINE PROVIDERS. MEANING. THAT EVEN WHEN THEY CAN'T ACCESS. AND THEREFORE THERE. A FEDERAL. WE CAN BUILD A THEM WITH THE THEY NEED. MEDICATION PLOWED HERE FOR ALL. CORRECTLY ON THE STREET. YEAH OF COURSE ALSO DIRET THE OF. TO CALAMP LITTLE. CAROL AND HAND CARE MANAGER A LITTLE AT BUT GOALKEEPER EXCLUDE MEDICAL. I'LL WE COULD NOT REACH. NINE CARTER OVERWHELMING DR THANK YOU BYE PROVIDED SHE- DIDN'T ENCOUNTER PARK ACADEMIC MEDICAL IN LAW WORKING BUT ARE PROLONGED POVERTY MA. HE TOOK A FEW AS WELL AS NPOS NO OPTION. DIFFICULT ISSUES RECOGNIZING MEDICAL MOBILITY ABOUT FOR PUBLICATION LIVERY AND PRESERVE THE FLEXIBILITY. BIDEN REALITY HEALTHCARE THE POPULATION WITH HER AND IN DOING SO ALSO RECOGNIZES THE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL COLLECTIVELY SEARCH AND HUMAN. LIFE IS WORTHY OF OUR LIVES. SH SH. THANKS THANK YOU OKAY EXCELLENT RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW LET'S BRING ON DR MERION MERCY. HELLO AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT YOUR PAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY ABOUT A TOPIC THAT IS VERY DEAR TO ME MEDICAL CARE OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. MY NAME'S MERRY MARKEY DOCTOR MARQUIS FROM A PHYSICIAN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AT UCLA. FIFTEEN YEARS MY MEDICAL PRACTICE HAS BEEN EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED. TO PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS. I PRACTICE IN STREETS IN CAMERON'S EMERGENCY SHELTERS TRANSITIONAL HOME OF THE NINETEEN KRAJ THROUGH KEY HOTEL REALLY ANYWHERE WHERE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. UCLA DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR ABOUT THIRTY TWO YEARS BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY DURING THESE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS WE'VE SEEN A MARKET INCREASE. IN PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS. TOGETHER WITH PHYSICIANS RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS WE'VE TREATED OVER EIGHTY SIXTEEN EIGHTY THOUSAND PATIENTS RANGING IN AGE FROM NINETY TWO TO A NEW BORN JUST TWO DAYS OLD. EIGHTY THREE SIXTY NINE IS ALL ABOUT ACCESS THE OVER ARCHING COMPLAINT AMONG THE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS WE CAN IN OUR COLLECTIVE STORY IF. THEY'RE PERSISTENT BARRIERS TO CARE. THAT DRESS SO WELL BY EIGHTY THREE SIXTY NINE ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE TIME THE PRIMARY HAVE AN ASSIGNED PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER IN THE SYSTEM. HOMELESS PATIENTS EXPERIENCED PROHIBITIVE ACCESS AND OFTEN GET DROPPED BY THE P. C. P. WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT. AND THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN. BY THE SAME STANDARD OF CARE THAT WE WANT IN OUR REGULAR HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. I WISH I HAD TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE STORIES OF THE TERRIBLE HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE IN OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. AND THE UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES GIVEN THE RUNAROUND LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE SUCH AS THINGS LIKE. DENTAL ABSCESSES TOO LONG CAUSING MENINGITIS LEADING TO A COAL MINE A LONG TERM HOSPITALIZATION- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PROPOSED LAST MINUTE. AMENDMENTS THAT WE THINK WOULD LIMIT OF TREATMENT ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDERS. FROM PERFORMING EVEN THE SIMPLE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. FOR REFERRING TO SPECIALISTS WHEN NEEDED. THAT WOULD NEGATE THE WHOLE IMPETUS FOR THE BELL N. AS A LICENSED ADDICTION. I'M CONCERNED THAT IF WE KEEP US FROM PROVIDING THE KIND OF COMPASSIONATE BASIC STANDARD OF CARE. TO HELP. PEOPLE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS- SO I ASK YOU- WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE TO VOTE. TO VOTE FOR THE BILL ENTERED WITHOUT THE HANDMAID'S WRAP UP THEN DON'T WORRY DOCTOR PAIN YOU CAN COUNT ON US TO.

MORE EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TESTING OR IMAGING ARE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. AND ALSO TRYING TO ENSURE THAT- KNOWING THAT THE POINT OF THE BILL IS TO.

FOUR FOUR ONE FOR US. AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- MEMBERS- I APPRECIATE UP TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY ON ABC FOUR FOUR ONE. SIMPLY MY THIS LEGISLATION PICKS UP WHERE A. B. ELEVEN SIXTY ONE LEFT OFF LAST SESSION AFTER IT WAS VETOED THIS EFFORT SEEKS TO CREATE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO DEDICATED SURFING WAVE BASINS. WHICH ARE NEW TO CALIFORNIA AND GENERATE REAL SEARCHABLE WAVES AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT FIFTY MILLION GALLON GALLON BODY OF WATER. THESE WAIT BASINS ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM WAVE POOLS AND SWIMMING POOLS. THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF A MAN MADE WAVE BASIN INCLUDE THE VOLUME OF WATER CHEMICAL DISPERSION CAUSED BY WAVE ACTION WATER CLARITY OCCUPANCY RATE THE SIZE OF THE WAVE BASIN MEANS THEY CAN'T PROPERLY BE REGULATED. BY EXISTING GUIDELINES FOR pWATER PARKWAY POOLS. IT'S INTRODUCTION WE TOOK A MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE VETO LETTERS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND US RELATIONS AS WELL AS FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMAGE TAKEN IN ASSEMBLY HEALTH. SINCE IT HAS ARIVED IN THIS HOUSE A CD PH REMAINS OPPOSED THE MEASURE THE DEPARTMENT DOES RELATIONS SENT AN OPPOSITION LETTER JUST LAST WEEK ADDRESSING MORE MINUTES FELL SHORT. OF ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS I AS WELL AS MY SPONSOR ME COMMITTED TO FINDING A RESOLUTION FOR THE PROPER NEW REGULATORY STRUCTURE MUST CREATE FOR CALIFORNIA WAY BASINS. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD THEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF OTHER STATES LIKE FLORIDA TEXAS THAT HAVE ALREADY PASSED SIMILAR REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES- ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF THE WORLD SURF LEAGUE. THE YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE MODERATOR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE I THINK WE HAVE THAT CHOICE WITH US FROM KEEPING PUBLIC AFFAIRS WORLD SURF LEAGUE. GOOD MORNING SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS ACTUALLY SOME HALF THE WORLD SURF LEAGUE TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF A. B. FOUR FORTY ONE TODAY. WSL THE GLOBAL ORGANIZATION BASED IN SANTA MONICA CALIFORNIA. NINE ITS OWN PROFESSIONAL SURFING. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PUTTING THIS MATTER FORWARD. WITNESSES INVEST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND GENERATE LONG TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS. EIGHTEEN NEW TOURISM DESTINATION OLYMPIC ORGANIZERS ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT USING WAY BASED ON TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT CERTAIN EVENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. ALL STATES LIKE TEXAS AND FLORIDA HAVE ADOPTED UNIQUE RULES AND REGULATIONS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY FOR WAVE BASINS. CALIFORNIA STILL TREATS WAY BASED ON THE SAME AS PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS OR AWAY FOR YOU MIGHT FIND AT THE LOCAL WATER PARK. THIS CREATES A DISINCENTIVE. FOR DEVELOPERS TO BRING THESE PROJECTS THE CALIFORNIA. AB FOUR FORTY ONE ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY CREATING NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS AROUND WATER QUALITY SANITATION PROCEDURES. IN THE UNDERLYING EQUIPMENT THAT GENERATES THE WAVE. THE SCALE THESE MENUS WHICH IS ROUGHLY OVER. SIX FOOTBALL FIELDS LONG AND CONTAINS OVER. FIFTEEN MILLION GALLONS OF WATER WARRANT THEIR OWN SET OF RULES AND REGULATIONS. OTHER KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOME IMPORTANTLY BASINS INCLUDE. THE CONSTANT WATER CIRCULATION CREATED BY BREAKING SIX FOOT WAVE. PERSON STATIC WATER TURNED OVER BY PUMPS. LOW USER CAPACITY VERSUS HIGH USER CAPACITY. AND FINALLY THE PRINCIPAL RECREATIONAL USE. IS FOR SURFING NOT SWIMMING. LARGELY THE SAME BILL THIS COMMITTEE PASSED LAST SUMMER BUT CONTAINS SEVERAL NOTABLE CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE STRENGTHENING CAL OSHA'S ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. IN EXPANDING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REFERRAL. THERE ARE SEVERAL OUTSTANDING ISSUES REMAINING AND WE'RE ENGAGED WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHES. A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT IS PROTECTIVE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND I ASSURE I BUILT THIS MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL GO WILD.

THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT- SO MY MIND THEY CAN STILL ADDRESS THEY CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THROUGH REGULATION- BUT WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SURE THE GAME THANK YOU MISTER FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS- IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE SAID BUT SURFING IS A REALLY BIG DEAL IN CALIFORNIA- AND THE WITH THIS THESE NEW WAVE BASIN SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WORLD. IN SURFING IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WORK WITH THESE- WITH THESE AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH A REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT WILL WORK- I UNDERSTAND IT THEY'VE- THEY'VE THEY'VE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL OF COURSE HAS BEEN VETOED IN THE PAST. WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT WILL WORK WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE IS WHAT IT NEEDS TO BE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT AS FOR THE REQUEST OF MY VOTE. RIGHT THANKS FOR MUCH SUMMER MEZA WE'RE STOPPING THE SUBCOMMITTEE SENT US OUT TO SCORN YET BUT WHEN IT APPROPRIATE TIME WE WILL- WE CHECK ON THE STATUS WILL TAKE UP THE VOTES OF THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. OKAY I DON'T SEE ANY. AUTHORS HERE AT THE MOMENT. OKAY SO JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A COMMITTEE HAVE A BILLBOARD COMMITTEE ON HEALTH- WE ARE AVAILABLE SO WE HAVE BILLS FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IN THIS AREA AND GIVE SEND ROBERT REAVIS XU X. MAHER CG GABRIEL AND MCCARTY. HUH I SEE A SEVEN MEMBER IN THIS AREA AND WELCOME SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE BY SEVERN IS ERIN- WELCOME. PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. AND SENATORS- THIS YOU SHOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE TODAY A. B. EIGHT THIRTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO OFFER AN HIV TEST AT ANY PATIENT FOR WHOM A BLOOD DRAW IS ALREADY BEING DONE. WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL AMENDMENTS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE ANY BURDEN ON THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THANK THE CHAIR. AND HIS STAFF FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WE WILL BE TAKING TODAY. WITHIN OUR AMENDMENTS WE HAVE ADDED SEVERAL EXEMPTIONS. FROM THE MANDATE WHICH INCLUDE IF THE PERSON IS IN A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION. OR IF THE PERSON HAS A PATIENT WITH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS. WAS OFFERED AN HIV TEST AND CONSENTED TO IT. OR IF THE PERSON IS PREGNANT AND WAS TESTED PURSUANT TO EXISTING LAW. AND FINALLY IF THE PERSON IF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT KNOWS THAT THE PATIENT HAS HIV OR HAS BEEN TESTED FOR IT. WITHIN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS. WE HAVE ADDED A MINIMUM AGE OF TWELVE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MOST RECENT GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE. FURTHERMORE THE BILL ALLOWS THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO USE RAPID HIV TESTING FOR SOME TEST KITS. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO REFER ITS PATIENTS WITH A POSITIVE TEST RESULTS THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR THIRD PARTY. THAT IS QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE POST HIV TESTING COUNSELING. AND AS FOR PATIENTS WHO LEAVE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PRIOR TO RECEIVING A TEST THEY WILL BE REFERRED TO A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR A QUALIFIED THIRD PARTY. PROVIDED IT HAS A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT WITH THE HOSPITAL- THESE ARE ALL THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE TAKEN SINCE THE BILL HAS BEEN IN THE SENATE NOT TO MENTION THE SEVERAL OTHERS WE TOOK IN THE ASSEMBLY WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO WORK WITH EXISTING OPPOSITION TO FIND A COMPROMISE THAT DOES NOT SACRIFICE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR BILL BUT DESPITE OUR EFFORTS OPPOSITION REMAINS IN THEIR SAME POSITION HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE THE LAST MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR HIV TESTING DOES NOT ROUTINELY OCCUR. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION CALLED ON ROUTINE HIV TESTING IN A T. D.'S MORE THAN THREE DECADES AGO ACCORDING TO A REPORT RELEASED BY THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION THEIR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT RATES IN CALIFORNIA INCREASED FROM AGE GROUPS AND PARTICULARLY AMONG THE UNINSURED AND MEDICAID IN SHORT BLACK AND HISPANIC POPULATIONS. THEY FOUND THAT THE INCREASED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT RATES BY THESE POPULATIONS MAY REFLECT LIMITATIONS IN ACCESS OF CARE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THE FINDINGS EVEN STATE THAT RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON WAYS TO REDUCE EERGENCY DEPARTMENT USE POLICYMAKERS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE PROVISION OF CARE AND CONSIDER WAYS TO INCORPORATE THAT REALITY INTO THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICES. OTHER STATE AND NATIONAL REPORTS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT POSITIVITY RATES ARE HIGHER IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THEN AND OTHER HEALTH CARE OR TESTING SITES ONE POINT 723% COMPARED TWO POINT 9% OR LESS THESE REPORTS ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES% OF LIGHT AP THIRTY FIVE IS FOCUSED ON EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. I NEED TO KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO INCREASE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT USE INSTEAD IT IS AN OPPORTUNE. FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO HAVE ACCESS TO AN HIV TEST SINCE MANY OF THEM USE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AS PRIMARY CARE. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO PROPER HEALTH CARE. CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN AS THE STATE THAT LEADS THE NATION IN INNOVATIVE THINKING AND LEGISLATION. BUT I WANT TO ALSO NOTE THAT ACCORDING TO THE CDC ALSO LEADS THE NATION IN THE MOST NEW. HIV CASES PER YEAR. THE STATE STILL HAS MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND IS EXPERIENCING. FORTY FOUR HUNDRED NEW DIAGNOSIS EVERY YEAR. OPPOSITION WILL TELL YOU THAT DESPITE THE TWELVE OR MORE AMENDMENTS I HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS EVERY SINGLE CONCERN THEY HAVE HAD THEY REMAINED OPPOSED BECAUSE ULTIMATELY. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THIS TESTING. THIS IS WHERE. I SEE THAT THEY ARE WRONG. FOR ALL THE REASONS I'VE JUST STATED. SO IN CLOSING WELL I CAN. AND AS A CLOSING THOUGHT FOR NOW. WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK ALL OF YOU IS IDENTIFYING NEW PEOPLE WITH HIV AND GETTING THEM INTO CARE AND TREATMENT JUSTIFY JUST A LITTLE MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE STAFF. WITH THAT I. AM HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND ALSO INTRODUCE RAN MARTIN WHO REPRESENTS OUR- BILL SPONSOR AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH A CEMETERY AND- AND- IT'S NOT CONFIRM YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS CORRECT YES THANK YOU SO MUCH WORKING COMMITTEE ON THOSE SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO TAKE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT WILL BEGIN WITH THAT RAIN MARTIN WHO I SEE IS UP IN THE GALLERY I'LL MAKE NOTE THAT SINCE THE OPPOSITION DOES HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I WILL GIVE YOU UP TO FOUR MINUTES OF OUT THE CLOSING TIME FOR BOTH SIDES SO- REMARKS PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I HOPEFULLY WON'T TAKE THE FOUR MINUTES BECAUSE OF DESERT MISSOURI DID A GREAT JOB OF SUMMARIZING THE BILL. FIRST OFF I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. ON IMPROVING THE BILL OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO AND MR MISSOURI FOR STICKING WITH US FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS TO. GET THIS POLICY ADOPTED. MMHM THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE ARE REALLY GOOD AT TESTING PEOPLE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEDICAL FACILITIES. WHERE WE'RE NOT GOOD ABOUT DOING THAT IS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS- SOME HOSPITALS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT MANY ARE NOT DOING ROUTINE HIV TESTING. AND WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS TO REQUIRE THAT AT LEAST A MANDATE TO OFFER- IS- IS IMPOSED ON HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS. MR NEWBERRY POINTED OUT WE STILL GET FORTY FOUR HUNDRED NEW CASES OF HIV EVERY YEAR. THAT IS CAUSED IN GREAT PART BY THE 15% OF THE PEOPLE WITH HIV WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE HIV POSITIVE- FORTY FIVE PERCENT- OF THE THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. AGE RANGE DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY'RE HIV POSITIVE. AND THEY'RE CAUSING FORTY PERCENT. OF THE NEW INFECTIONS. WE NEED TO GET TO THOSE PEOPLE EDUCATE THEM- MAKE SURE THEY'RE AWARE OF THEIR HIV STATUS. SO THEY'RE NOT UNINTENTIONALLY- EXPOSING OTHER PEOPLE. AS A MEDICAL CARE PROVIDER HF IS VERY SYMPATHETIC. TO THE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION RELATIVE TO THE BURDEN. ON THEIR OPERATIONS. AND WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO REDUCE THAT BURDEN. OF PLAYED BY MANY MANY MINUTES PER PATIENT- WITHOUT GIVING UP ON THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. A MORE HIV TESTING OCCURRING WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HARDEST TO GET TWO. OF THEM FOR THOSE FOR THOSE REASONS AND FOR THE REASONS THAT MR NAJARIAN HAS OUTLINED- WE URGE THE. COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH L. L. MOVE ON TO. IT AS A- OF EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY- SEE NO ONE ELSE IN THE GALLEY LET'S MOVE TO ROOM ONE TWELVE SEEN ON ROOM TWELVE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES. FOR WITNESSES WHO WAS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE. NAME ORGANIZATION POSITION ONLY. OKAY ONCE AGAIN PLEASE PRESS ONE OF THE ZERO. FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE. ONE ZERO. AND WE HAVE NO ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATOR NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THERE TO THE WITNESSES TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE SO MODERATE CAN PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE DEMAND FROM AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND MARIA SPERBER FROM CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES A TOTAL FOUR MINUTES BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU WILL BEGIN WITH- TEMEN. THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS TO MADDEN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS THAT WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE. MY FIRST OF ALL WE'D LIKE TO THANK MR NEWS ARIAN IN THE SPONSOR FOR THEIR TIME AND EFFORTS TO ADDRESS OUR ON GOING CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. WHILE THE AMENDS TO EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE IMPROVE THE CONSENT PROCESS THERE IS STILL A CONVERSATION REQUIRED BETWEEN THE PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT THAT IS BOTH TIME CONSUMING. AND POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE. PATIENTS ARE IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT WITH SERIOUS CONCERNS ARE LIKELY AFRAID AND ARE NOT MISSING THE MIND TO BE DISCUSSING AN HIV TEST. THEY MAY HAVE TO BE UPSET WITH THE TREATING PHYSICIAN CRISSCROSSING PERFORMING AN HIV TEST. WHEN I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR SYMPTOMS LEADING. LEADING TO LONGER CONVERSATIONS. THESE CONVERSATIONS AT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TOTAL TIME OF CARE. PROVIDED IN BUSY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE CDC BLOOD DRAWS ARE PERFORMED ON 42% OF ALL ET PATIENTS. CALIFORNIA'S EAST. MERSEA DEPARTMENTS TREAT FOURTEEN MILLION PATIENTS PER YEAR AND EVEN IF ADDING. AN HIV TEST TO EACH OF THOSE ENCOUNTERS ONLY TOOK AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MINUTES. THAT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL UPWARDS OF TWENTY NINE MILLION ADDITIONAL MINISTER CARE EACH YEAR THAT EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WOULD ASK. BEATS PER RIDE. THERE'S NO WAY TO ABSORB THIS WITHOUT IMPACTING THE TIMELINES AND QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED TO ALL PATIENTS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS BARRIERS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPORT WHICH EXAMINED HOSPITALS THAT VOLUNTARY VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM TO OPERATE CHEVY TESTING. THE REPORT. STATES QUOTE PROGRAM SUSTAINABILITY MAY HINGE UPON EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY HOW TO ACTUALLY COVER THE. COST OF SCREENING PATIENTS FOR HIV. MAYBE A THIRTY FIVE NOT ADDRESS THOSE CAN. AND WOULD INITIALLY RESULT IN UNEXPECTED COSTS UNINSURED PATIENTS. GENERALLY INSURED PATIENTS MAY HAVE A SHARE OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TESTING WHICH WILL LIKELY BE UNKNOWN TO THEM AT THE TIME THE OFFERS MADE. HIM CALL IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE COSTS OF. THE HOSPITAL DURING THE PILOT PROGRAM RECEIVED SOME LEVEL EXTERNAL FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PILOT. WE BELIEVE EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE SHOULD BE CLARIFIED TO ENSURE PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS ARE REIMBURSED FOR PROVIDING HIV TEST AS WELL AS ENSURING PATIENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY COSTS RELATED TO TESTING. FOR THESE REASONS REMAIN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WHEN I BRING ON MARIA SPERBER FROM CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I THINK YOU LEFT YOU ONE MINUTE FORTY SECONDS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARIA FOREVER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. WASHINGTON FAMILY MEMBER THE VARIANCE CALLED AND WE THANK THE AUTHOR BLOCKAGE TO THE DIALOGUE HOWEVER HUGELY RESPECTFULLY DISAGREES WITH WHERE HIV TESTING FOR NON CLINICAL INDICATIONS SHOULD OCCUR. TIMELY TRIAGE TREATMENT AND CARE FOR CRITICAL PATIENTS MUST BE AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PRIORITY TO SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT AGAINST. UNTOWARD EMERGENT CONSEQUENCE OF. ADDITIONAL HIGH REQUIRED FOR NON AMONG CARE WILL INCREASE THE ALREADY OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS INCREASE THE TIME IT TAKES TO CARE FOR PATIENTS WHO PRESENT AN EASY. COMPROMISE WHEN NEEDED ABILITY TO PERFORM CENTRAL EMERGENCY CARE FUNCTIONS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THE HIV SCREENING WORK WELL MUST BE ADJUSTED TO AN EMERGENT YOUR WORKFLOW I TIME AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE ENDEAVOR THAT ULTIMATELY PREVENT ALL PATIENTS FROM GETTING THE MOST APPROPRIATE CARE SHE HAD INDICATED IN THE CDPH RECORD. NUMEROUS BARRIERS MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT HIV TESTING WOULD BE SENSIBLE FOR BOTH THE PATIENT IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. STAGES OF SCOTT SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES BUT THE OTHER TOPICS INCLUDING HIV TESTING WITHIN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ONE ALTERNATIVE TO CONSIDER IN SHORT EACH PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO FORMALLY COME BACK WITH A BIRDIE THREE DEPARTMENTS THAT DO NOT VOLUNTARILY PERFORM HIV SCREENING EACH WITH A COMMUNITY KERR CRACKED. CLINIC PARTNER THAT WILL PROVIDE HIV SCREENING AND FOLLOW UP CARE TO PATIENTS. ANOTHER OPTION IS TO ASK PATIENTS IF THEY WANT AN HIV TEST DURING THE TRIAGE PROCESS AND IT'S SO DIRECT THEM TO A LOCAL FACILITY FOR TESTING. IN THIS WAY HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT ARE REFERRING PATIENTS AFTER THE FACT QUITE SPECIALTY CLINICS WHERE THE PATIENT CAN RECEIVE TESTING COUNSELING TO THE STAGING AND TREATMENT MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR NEEDS. AND EXCITING BETTER SUITED TO THEIR CONCLUSION ABOUT THESE RETURNS THE EXCHANGE REMAINS A POLITICAL MESSAGE THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT'S LET'S NOW MOVE ONTO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE OF YOUR PUBLIC GALLERIES YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC ALEX. MOVED TO ROOM TWENTY TWELVE SEEN ON ROOM TWELVE. OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR WITNESSES WHO ATTESTED OUT. TO EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE. OKAY AND ONCE AGAIN YOU'D LIKE TO UP WITH PRESS ONE THE ZERO. TOP FOR A. B. EIGHT THIRTY FIVE ONE NINE ZERO. WE DO HAVE ONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME IT'S NINE TWENTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN- GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBER DATA INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU EXLINE. WE DO HAVE ONE MORE ONE MOMENT PLEASE. THE NEXT ONE WILL COME FROM NINE EIGHTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS ELIZABETH AND I'M IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU EXLINE. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANKS FOR MUCH THAT'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. K. STATE YES CENTER GONZALEZ YEP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I AND I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I HAVE- IN LONG BEACH UNFORTUNATELY VERY VERY HIGH RATES OF HIV AND STDS YOU SEE THAT SORT OF STATEWIDE BUT- LONG BEACH HAS DOUBLE- THE NUMBERS AND SO WE'VE BEEN TACKLING ON HOW EXACTLY. TO IDENTIFY MORE INDIVIDUALS IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE LIVING WITH HIV- AND THEN ALSO PROVIDE THEM WITH CARE AND RESOURCES SO. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS BILL- BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD THAT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR YOUR CLOTHES JUST ON THE LOGISTICS BECAUSE THEY DO. IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM SO WE JUST LIKE TO KIND OF ENVISION WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE- IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE. YOU KNOW- IN RESPONSE TO WHAT THE OPPOSITION WILL BE PRESENTING SO WITH THAT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THINKING THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RIGHT SO AGAIN A SUMMONS AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE BILL- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- WE WANT TO BE SURE WE ADDRESS. THAT THE OPPOSITION RACE WAS ABOUT- PAYMENT ACTUALLY AND- AND SUPPORTING THIS AND I WILL MAKE NOTE THAT- NOT ONLY OF COURSE HE TOOK THE AMENDMENT ON US PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE WE ALSO LOOKED UP AND- FOUND OUT THAT. IT IS ACTUALLY RATED. AS A PREVENTIVE SERVICE IT WAS RAISING EIGHT WHICH MEANS THAT IT ACTUALLY IS COVERED WITHOUT CO PAY FIVE. HUNDRED AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND WE EVEN CHECKED TO BE SURE THAT MERGES TWO ROOMS WOULD STILL COULD AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT PROVISION SO. THEREFORE IF YOU ARE HAVE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE- YOU ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THAT WITHOUT COST SHARING- IT'S ALSO COVERED BY MEDI CAL AS WELL- SO I CERTAINLY DO MAKE NOTE THAT IF SOMEONE'S. TOTALLY UNINSURED THAT COULD BE A GAP BUT- FRANKLY BETWEEN THE INSURED IT WHETHER YOU HAVE MEDIC HOW ARE INSURED THAT WILL BE COVERED WITHOUT COST SHARE- I DO FIND OUT WHAT WE DID HAVE JUST A PRESENTATION ALSO ON STREET MEDICINE AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TO. REACH PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND SO I DO FIND A LITTLE CHALLENGING TO SAY THAT THE ANSWER WOULD ACTUALLY BE IS THAT ONCE YOU HIT SOMEONE SHOWS UP EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WE THEN. SAY IF YOU WANT TO TEST WE HAVE SEND YOU SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO TRY TO CLOSE THAT GAP BUT ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOU. TOOK AN AMENDMENT THAT SAID IF THE E. OURS AWARE AND IN THEIR OWN RECORD AND BY LIKE THE WHOLE ENTIRE HOSPITAL RECORD YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE R. HAS ACCESS TO. THAT PERSON'S EITHER GOTTEN THE TESTER READY IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS OR ACTUALLY THE REPOSITORY KNOW. THEN ACTUALLY THEY DON'T NEED TO DO THAT IT'S UP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OTHERWISE TAKE TIME TO CHECK THAT OUT BUT- AGAIN THAT WOULD REDUCE THAT TIME BURDEN AS WELL AS WE ARE HOPEFULLY. IDENTIFYING PEOPLE. WHO HAVE HIV GETTING THEM TO CARE I THINK THAT'S THE PART WE NEED TO BE SURE WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON GETTING THE CARE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN AGAIN. I HAVE THIS. REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THIS CONTAGIOUS DISEASE AND THAT'S I THINK THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY SO WE CAN LIMIT THE SPREAD. AND EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY EVEN ELIMINATE- IT H. IDEAS WELL. SO I AM. APPRECIATE THE- THEY WERE BROUGHT UP BY A PHONE. OF PEACE. THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW- BUT WORKING WITH THEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT THE PATH FORWARD TO- SHOULD RETIRE AND THEN A FIGHT. AND THEN GET. PEOPLE ACCESS TO THE CARE THEY NEED- IF THEY ARE HIV POSITIVE- AND ALSO TRYING NOT TO OVERBURDEN EMERGENCY ROOM SO I APPRECIATE THAT WORK. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU DR PAN I. JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL I. HE WAS A- I WAS A STAFFER WITH A LOT MORE HERE AT THAT TIME HERE WHERE I WORKED ON A. B. E. THIRTY FIVE FOR MY FORMER FOR MY FORMER BOSS- SOME LIMIT AND THEN SOME REMEMBER PAUL KRIKORIAN- AND WE DO AGREE THAT INSURERS NEED TO FULFILL THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATION AND WILL WORK WITH CAL A STEP. TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE BUT WOULD HE BE WITH EIGHT THIRTY FIVE DATE WAS OBLIGATED INSURERS TO PAY FOR HIV TEST SO THERE'S ALSO THAT PIECE AS WELL BUT I JUST WANTED TO MENTION- SECOND- AGAIN IT HAVING WORKED ON THIS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RUN A BUILD THAT CAME UP WITH THE STUDY WHICH DISCOVERED THAT ONE POINT 7% OF UNSUSPECTING INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN FOURTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE. WHO WENT TO THE ER ROOMS WERE CAPTURED AS INDIVIDUALS WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WERE HIV POSITIVE I MEAN THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER AND THAT'S WHY WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD NOW WITH WITH REQUIRING THIS ON AN ONGOING BASIS IT'S REQUIRED. BUT IT GIVES THE OPTION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO OPT OUT THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE HOSPITAL TO PASS THE E. OUR ROOM TO ASK- AND LOGISTICALLY WE TRY TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD WORK HAVING WORKED WITH THE ER DOCTORS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN I WORKED ON THIS BILL THE FIRST BILL- EVERY IT AT EVERY ITERATION WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM. BECAUSE WE DO UNDERSTAND THE STRENUOUS CONDITIONS OF IN YOUR ROOM SO THE JUST SPEAKING TO THE LOGISTICS IF I'M UNDERSTANDING IT CORRECTLY WE WANTED THAT'S WHY E INSERTED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW- FOR THE POSITIVE RESULT TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND FOR THIRD PARTY THAT IS QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE THE POST HIV TESTING COUNSELING SO WE'VE TRIED TO TAKE EVERY. DIFFERENT APPROACH IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE E. R. THE STRESS ON THE E. R. ROOM IS REALLY BUT THAT'S THE LAST. THATWE CAN ACTUALLY CAPTURE. ANY OUTLINE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE TESTED THAT THAT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE. SO- PROBABLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTERS THERE AND WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM SOURCE OFFERING INTERCEPTED E. BUSINESS WE- TABLE SAT SCORE- HOPEFULLY WE CAN THEN TAKE MOTIONS AND- THE ENVELOPES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW CFO'S ARE LIMITED TO MAKING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS IN ANNUAL SALES FROM THEIR FOOD PRODUCTS. THIS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FIGURE HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN SIX YEARS TO. ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION AND THE RISING COST OF LIVING HERE IN OUR STATE. IN ADDITION CFO'S ARE NOT CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO SHIP HOMEMADE FOOD THROUGH THE MAIL OR- OTHER THIRD PARTY- SOME. DELIVERY SERVICES ACROSS OUR STATE- AND- THIS IS DESPITE THE RISING IMPORTANCE OF THESE SERVICES. AND SO THIS BILL IT PROPOSES TO ADDRESS ISSUES BY FIRST ALLOWING IN STATE THE DELIVERY PRODUCTS VIA MAIL ORDER AND OTHER- DELIVERY SERVICE. SECOND INCREASING THE SALES LIMIT OF TWO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR CLASS AT CFO. AND A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR A CLASS B. CFO. AND LASTLY- IN PREVENTING THE CLASS B. CFO'S FROM NEEDING A COLLEGE WOULD PERMIT IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES. THAT WOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IMPORTANT CHANGES TO. TO OUR STATE'S EXISTING COTTAGE FOOD LAWS- THIS LEGISLATION WILL. WILL CREATE SUBSTANTIAL NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL ENTREPRENEURS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FINE WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY- THIS MORNING OR TWO CFO'S REPRESENTED BY- SEE LAURA. BUT PALOUSE- AND SOME CHANGE AND WITH THE- THAT'S WHAT I AND THANK YOU MR CHAIR RIGHT SO MUCH SENATOR- MODERATE PLEASE BRING ONTO A LINE OR TWO. WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT LAURA PALAU SKI FROM THE LIKE THE BULLS AND SONIA CHANG FROM CALLIE GRANOLA. ARE YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES MAX PERFORMANCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU. LET'S BEGIN WITH A LOWER PALAU SKI. HI GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE BEGIN. GREAT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND SENATE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS LAURA PALAU SKI MY HUSBAND AND I STARTED COLLECTIBLES WHICH IS A COTTAGE FOOD OPERATION WHERE WE CREATE EXCEL HEALTHY HOMEMADE SNACKS AND SWEETS. WE DECIDED TO START OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF OUR DAUGHTER WHO SUFFERS FROM ANYTHING SENSITIVITY SHE COULD NOT EAT ANYTHING PROCESS WITHOUT BECOMING ILL AND EXPERIENCING A TOOTH PAIN OR ISSUES THAT MADE US AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF EATING CLEAN UNPROCESSED AND FACES WE WANTED TO OFFER A GREAT TASTING HEALTHY THREE TO OTHERS WHO SUFFER FROM PAIN ISSUES. MANY PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA COME THE DOCUMENT AREA FARMERS MARKETS AND THEY TELL ME OFTEN THEY DO NOT HAVE OPTIONS LIKE OUR PRODUCT IN THEIR AREAS AND ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY FIND OUT WE CANNOT SHIP OUR PRODUCTS ARE COMPLETELY SHELF STABLE THEIR SAFETY SHIP AND THEY ARE MUCH HEALTHIER. THAN MOST THINGS YOU CAN FIND ON THE SHELF. THIS YEAR WE WILL LIKE LIKELY REACH THAT FIFTY DOLLAR ANNUAL. AND IT DOES LIKE A LOT AMOUNT OF MONEY. BUT IT REALLY ISN'T AND LET ME EXPLAIN IF YOU RUN YOUR BUSINESS VERY WELL YOU MAY MAKE A NET PROFIT OF THIRTY PERCENT. THIS TRANSLATES TO AN ANNUAL NET PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM A COTTAGE. TO A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN OR BRICK AND MORTAR LET ALONE CONTRIBUTE FAMILY FINANCE. ALSO WANTS THAT FIFTY THOUSAND CAP IS REACHED WE MUST INFORM OUR CUSTOMERS THAT WE HAVE HAD TO HALT PRODUCTION TEMPORARILY. AND NOT ONLY DOES THIS HINDER OUR BUSINESS AND TRUSTED OUR CUSTOMERS. BUT IT DOES NOTHING TO IMPROVE THE- SAFETY. CLEARLY IF WE CAN SAFELY PRODUCE AND SELL FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE PRODUCT FROM OUR HOME KITCHEN. IN THE FIRST TEN MONTHS OF THE YEAR. THEN WE CAN ALSO PRODUCE AND SELL ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS THIS YEAR. WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE SAFETY. BY RAISING ITS TAIL CAP WE WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP CURRENT CUSTOMERS YEAR ROUND WHILE MAINTAINING THE SAFETY. AND LASTLY AN INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL CAP YOU KNOW THE WHITE FINANCIAL GAP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN MOVING FROM A COTTAGE FOOD. TO A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN OR BRICK AND MORTAR. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PASS AB ONE ONE FOUR FOUR THE POSITIVE IMPACT THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE THOUSANDS OF. COTTAGE FOOD OPERATORS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU.

ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER ASC CENTER QUEUE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR HI SUMMER SHOE WELCOME- PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN. PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER FOR THEIR INSURANCE. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WERE NOT THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER FOR THEIR INSURANCE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT WHO ARE ON THEIR PARTNER'S HEALTH PLAN WAR IN MANY INSTANCES DUE TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE STAYING ON THEIR PARENTS HEALTH PLANS UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. IN SOME INSTANCES PRIMARY POLICY HOLDERS MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPE OF CARE PROVIDED. THAT A PATIENT MAY NOT WANT REVEALED. IN SOME INSTANCES IT COULD ACTUALLY EVEN BE DANGEROUS FOR A PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER TO RECEIVE INFORMATION. ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT A PATIENT ON THEIR PLAN HAS RECEIVED. FOR EXAMPLE A WOMAN WHO'S ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE CARE OR CARE RELATED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MAY NOT WANT HER PARTNER TO KNOW SHE'S ACCESSING THAT CARE. FOR TRANSGENDER YOUTH MAY NOT WANT THEIR PARENTS TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE ACCESSING HEALTHCARE SERVICES. THIS BILL WOULD UPDATE EXISTING PATIENT PRIVACY LAWS TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST. IT AUTOMATICALLY ENSURES THE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY REGARDING SENSITIVE SERVICES AS THE FINER CONFIDENTIAL. AND NOT SENT TO THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER. SECOND IT EXPANDS EXISTING DEFINITION OF SENSITIVE SERVICES TO INCLUDE. BEHAVIOR HEALTH CARE AND GENDER FOR ME CARE. EXTENDING AUTOMATIC CONFIDENTIALITY FOR THOSE SERVICES AND THIRD. THAT ENSURES THAT PATIENTS WHO ARE RECEIVING SENSITIVE SERVICES HAVE A PATHWAY TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN. OR TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK THE CHAIR OF HIS COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR THEIR DEEP ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL. I'M COMMITTED TO TAKING AMENDMENTS AND SENATE JUDICIARY TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS TO CLARIFY. THAT CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION REQUEST SUPPLY TO ALL SERVICES NOT JUST ONE OR A FEW. AND SECONDLY TO REMOVE THE EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS FROM THE LIST OF DOCUMENTS IN WHICH HEALTH PLANS MUST NOTIFY. PATIENTS ABOUT THE CCR PROCESS. AND WE JUST ALSO MENTION THAT IN RECENT DAYS WE'VE HEARD SOME OPPOSITION SUGGEST. THAT THIS BILL MIGHT BE CHANGING EXISTING MEDICAL CONSENT LAW OR CHANGING THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR SERVICES. I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES ALL WE ARE DOING IS ENSURING THAT FOLKS WHO NEED CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS CAN RECEIVE THEM. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO RETURN IT OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESSES WE HAVE MOLLY ROBSON. WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND TOMMY MARTIN WITH A QUALITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH DECEMBER TWO AND APPRECIATE AGAIN ARE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS WHICH WILL BE TAKEN UP ACTUALLY AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT'S WEATHERED UP FOR YOU- I THINK YOU PEOPLE HAVE A COPY SHOULD. RECEIVE COPY BUT THEY WILL BE TAKEN UP TO A JUDICIARY. SO WITH THAT- WE'RE GOING TO FIRST BEGAN WITH US HI WATSON FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS UP IN THE GALLERY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES- TOTAL FOUR MINUTES FOR BOTH WITNESSES HAVE YOU GO OVER. TO KEEP IN MIND THAT SHORTENS THE TIME FOR YOUR- COMPATRIOT- SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH- MY ROBISON WELCOME. THANK YOU SHARE. A GOOD MORNING MOLLY ROPES AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA. WE REPRESENT THE SEVEN PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES WHO SERVE OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PATIENTS. ANNUALLY ACROSS THE STATE. PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS SPONSORING A B. ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR TO CONTINUE THE IMPORTANT WORK ADVOCATES AND LAWMAKERS UNDERTOOK. WHEN THEY PASSED SB ONE THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AGO. THANKS AT THE ONE THIRTY EIGHT PATIENTS HAVE CONTINUED TO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. TO GET CONFIDENTIALITY FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE. FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD CONFIDENTIALITY IS AT THE CORE OF ITS ROLE AS A TRUSTED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. ASIAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS SENSITIVE SERVICES LIKE REPRODUCTIVE CARE GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. MENTAL HEALTH CARE OR STI CARE WITHOUT FEAR OF THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION BEING EXPOSED. WHEN A PATIENT SEEKS CARE THEY MAY NOT REALIZE THAT THEIR INFORMATION ABOUT THE CARE THEY RECEIVE. COULD BE DISCLOSED BY ROUTINE. NOTICES FROM THEIR HEALTH INSURER. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MINORS AND YOUNG ADULTS ARE ON THEIR PARENTS INSURANCE. ANYONE WHO HAS SET WHO HAS HAD AN ADVOCATE COVERAGE ISSUES WITH THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE KNOWS. IT'S NOT A SIMPLE OR EASY PROCESS. AND PATIENTS RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. SHOULD NOT HAVE THE BURDEN OF ENLISTING AND HELP. IT LISTING THE HELP. OF CONSUMER RIGHTS ATTORNEYS AND ADVOCATES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET THE MEDICAL CARE THEY NEED CONFIDENTIALLY. HEALTHCARE IS PERSONAL AND THIS BILL SIMPLY EXPANDS WHO CAN RECEIVE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM THEIR INSURANCE. AND INSURE THAT PATIENTS AND THEIR INFORMATION ARE KEPT SAFE. FOR THESE REASONS WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT. OR SPONSOR EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR AND WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE- TOMMY MARTIN FROM EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. ALSO PROVIDE CUSTOMER SUPPORT OF EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS TOMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WILL CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY OF PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WHILE OTHER LEGISLATURES OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA ARE LAUNCHING ASSAULT AGAINST THEM. AND IF SO WILL IMPROVE THE WAY INSURANCE COMMUNICATIONS WORK SO CURRENTLY PATIENTS WERE UNDER SOMEONE ELSE'S PLAN THE OPTION OF SUBMITTING WHAT'S CALLED THE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS REQUIRED OR IF WE ARE TO THEIR PLANS. THE AUTHOR DESCRIBED IT TO NPR IS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT ONLY THE PATIENT RECEIVED DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THAT PATIENT CARE WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE SEEKING LGBTQ CLASS BUT THAT THERE. COULD YOU NOT HAVE RECORDED FAMILY. EVEN BACK THE R. ALL THE TRANSLATE INTO FULL CONFIDENCE. IS THAT HOW CAN SHE IS COMPLEX AND NOT MANY PATIENTS AREN'T EQUIPPED TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO NAVIGATE IT HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AN LGBTQ CLASS PATIENT FILED A CPR HE CONFIRMS THAT THE DVR WAS INCREASED AND THEREFORE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HIS INFORMATION WOULD BE PROTECTED. HE PROCEEDED TO OBTAIN CRAP WHICH IS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HIV PREVENTION MEDICATION. WHICH GIVES PEOPLE MORE AGENCY OVER THEIR HOUSE. AND THEIR WELL BEING AND THEIR FUTURE. STATIONS ARE ON ALL UNDERGO ROUTINE TESTS THE CONDITION OF BEING ON MEDICATION. AND INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE SERVICES WHAT IS CLOSE TO THE POLICY OWNER WHICH IN THIS CASE WITH THE PATIENT'S MOTHER. AND IT'S LED TO HIM BEING POURED OUT HIS VIAL CANLEY. SO THE PATIENT MADE A RESPONSIBLE DECISION TO SAFEGUARD THE ACCOUNT AND IN DOING SO IT WAS STRIPPED OF THE ABILITY TO COME OUT ON HIS TERMS. IN HIS MIND AND IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE SAFE THERE FOR HAND. FOR THIS BILL WILL HELP TO GET PATIENTS TO THE PRIVACY DIGNITY AND SAFETY EVERYONE DOES THEIR WHEN SEEKING HEALTH CARE AND WE RESPECTFULLY. URGE THE CANADIAN COURT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH- WITHOUT WANT TO DO KNOW WHAT THIS IS AND SOME OF A DEAL EIGHTY FOUR BEGIN WITH PUBLIC GALLERY SCENE ON ELSE THE PUBLIC GALLERY WILL MOVE OUT TO ROOM ONE TWELVE TINO ELSE ROOM TWELVE.

I'M LIKE THE BIRTH EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE CHAIRS WHILE AT THE AKURE SPONSORING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS IN THE LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE. REGRETTABLY AS ADULTS YOUNG THEY REMAIN OPPOSED. AS PREVIOUSLY REFERENCES MEASURES EXPAND THE MANNER IN WHICH IS GROWING YOUR INSURANCE CAN SUBMIT A REQUEST TO HAVE THEIR MEDICAL INFORMATION FOR YOU DIRECTED TO ALTERNATE ADDRESS. OFTEN-REFERRED TO AS THE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION REQUEST. AS WELL AS THE OBLIGATION PLANS INSURERS HONOR THOSE REQUESTS. UNFORTUNATELY AS WE STARTED THE PROCESS WE CANNOT FULLY APPRECIATE HOW BROAD THE INCIDENTS THEY'LL LET THEM HAVE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON THE PRIVACY ISSUES RELATED TO SENSITIVE SERVICES. AND THE NEEDED INSPIRED UPDATE THE REGIONAL LEGISLATION SIGNATURE ON MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS AND SERVICES RECEIVED THE PHONE PROTECTIONS INTENDED BY THE ORIGINATING LEGISLATION SB ONE THIRTY EIGHT. AS SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER AT THE ONE THIRTY EIGHT WAS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED UNDERSTANDING THAT CRITICAL BALANCE OF INSURING PATIENTS ACTIVE IMPORTANT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. ALSO PREACHING THAT MR DEPARTMENT WOULD BE PLACED ON PLANS AND ENSURE. IMPLEMENTING THIS TYPE. ONLY REQUIRES AN INITIAL WORKAROUND BY THE PLAN BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE PLAN TO CONTRIBUTE TRACK EACH REQUEST. AND GINGER THE COMBINATION OF BEING APPROPRIATELY KNOWLEDGE IS HONORED BY ALL PRINTERS. AND NETWORK THE BILL CURRENTLY STANDS THE OBLIGATION PLANS ON A CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNIQUE. COMMUNICATION REQUESTS WILL NO LONGER BE LIMITED TO SENSITIVE SERVICES. BUT INSTEAD WILL BE BROADLY APPLIED ALL. CERTAINLY ANYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO REQUEST THAT THE THING IN OUR HEADPHONES LOUD FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY- FOR A REASONABLE STANDARD TO BE APPLIED WHICH ALLOWS THE PLANT SOME FLEXIBILITY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR REMOVES ACCESSIBILITY REQUIRED PLANS INSURANCE ON OCT EIGHTEEN ARE. UNKNOWN VOLUME OF REQUESTS AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND COSTS THAT COULD PLAY SOME PLANS AND INSURE THAT CERTAINLY CONCERNING. ADDITIONALLY THE MOST RECENTLY PROPOSED AMENDMENTS INCLUDE AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. WE APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING ON RELATED INSURANCE- WHERE THEIR RATES THE NOTICE PROVISIONS SEEM TO GO BEYOND. AND ABOVE WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED TYPICAL WITH THAT IN MIND WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE SECTION TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INADVERTENTLY APPLYING THE NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS AND APPROPRIATELY COMMUNICATION SUCH AS APPOINTMENT TEXT MESSAGES EXCEPT FOR. WITH THAT IN MIND WE CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS AT THE SUMMIT. SUPPORT ACT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW LET'S BRING TO THE ARE NOW.

THANK YOU BOB A POST THANK YOU THANKS LINE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRPERSON AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANKS THANKS VERY MUCH MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK THE COMMITTEE OR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER MELINDA'S. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN- ASSEMBLYMAN CHEWED GOOD TO SEE YOU- I. HAVE A GREAT NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL FROM A PARENT'S PERSPECTIVE- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH FOR ADULTS-AND I DO RECOGNIZE THAT SP THIRTY EIGHT PUT MUCH OF THIS ALREADY INTO STATUTE. BUT AS A PARENT- EIGHT I AM I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S A GOOD THING THAT A CHILD WHO'S GOING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT COULD BE LIFE CHANGING OR SOMETHING THAT'S- REALLY AND- AN EMOTIONAL DIFFICULTY THAT THIRD STRUGGLING WITH HOW. IT'S OKAY TO KEEP THE PARENTS FROM KNOWING THAT IN AN EFFORT TO YOU KNOW FOR THOSE PARENTS OR OTHER CAREGIVERS- TO HELP THEM THROUGH THAT AND- YOUR CHILDREN YOUR YOUR YOUR SON HE'S LITTLE- SO YOU HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED YET THE- THE EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER KNOWN AS- TEENAGERS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU IT'S- IT CAN BE A STRUGGLE IN TEENAGERS AND EVEN YOU KNOW PRETEENS TYPICALLY. YOU KNOW THEY DON'T LIKE TO TALK TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. WE DIDN'T I'M SURE THEIR RATINGS WOULD PREFER TO TALK TO OUR FRIENDS ABOUT OR SOMEONE ELSE BUT NOT CERTAINLY NOT HER PARENTS. THE SAME GOES HOLDS TRUE FOR TODAY HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T NEGATE THE FACT THAT CHILDREN REALLY DO NEED THEIR PARENTS INPUT AND GUIDANCE AND COUNSEL ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AND BY PASSING LEGISLATION LIKE THIS THIS MEANS THAT THE PARENT HAS NO HOPE OF EVEN BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS IT- AND- I THINK ABOUT. BUT CHECK MY CHILD A MINOR WHO IS ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOW. IF A PARENT DOESN'T KNOW THAT THIS IS TAKING PLACE AND A PARENT DOESN'T KNOW THAT THIS. MINOR IS. SEEKING THESE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PERHAPS BEING GIVEN MEDICATION TO TREAT IT HOW IN THE WORLD IS APPARENT ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS THAT SOMETHING MAY BE GOING TERRIBLY WRONG CAN BE ABLE TO REACH OUT AND HELP THEM. IMAGINE THE- LIKE THE GUILT THAT WOULD OVERWHELM THE PARENT IF. YOU KNOW SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO THEIR CHILD AND- THEY WERE IGNORANT OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE THAT SAID THAT'S TERRIBLE BURDEN. TO PLACE ON A PARENT WHO- LIKELY LOVES THEIR CHILD MAYBE THEY'RE HAVING SOME DIFFICULTY IN SOME DIFFERENCES BUT STILL LOVES THEIR CHILD- SO FOR THAT REASON I AM NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WONDER IF. PERHAPS YOU COULD COMMENT ON SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LET ME JUST START BY SAYING. AS APPARENTLY Q. ALL OF US CARE VERY DEEPLY FOR OUR CHILDREN WANT TO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE- WHAT I. WILL SAY A FEW THINGS- I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR. MANY OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WE ALL MAY HAVE A BIT OF A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON A PATIENT'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE. BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT BECAUSE I THINK- THE OPPOSITION'S. ARGUMENTS ARE BIT MISPLACED. WITH REGARD TO WHAT IS CURRENT LAWSUIT THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN ASSERTING THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL WILL ALLOW CHILDREN TO ACCESS MEDICAL CARE IN SECRET. FROM THEIR PARENTS AND THAT STATEMENT IS JUST FRANKLY NOT TRUE- THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT EXISTING MEDICAL. CONSENT LAW IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT SERVICES A MINOR CAN CONSENT TO WITHOUT PARENTAL SIGN OFF- SO THERE ARE MANY LAWS STATE AND FEDERAL. ON MINOR CONSENT TO GIVE MINERS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS SERVICES LIKE PREGNANCY AND ABORTION CARE. MENTAL HEALTH CARE STD SERVICES WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT- I THINK A LOT OF OPPOSITION. MAY WISH THAT THOSE LAWS WERE DIFFERENT. BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T IMPACT THAT SO JUST WANNA MAKE THAT CLEAR WHAT THIS BILL DOES SAY THOUGH IS IF A PARENT CAN CAN IF IT IF THE PATIENT WAS A YOUNG PERSON. BUT CAN CONSENT TO A SENSE OF SERVICE WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS. THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS ON THE CARE THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL SO THAT'S WHAT THIS WHAT THIS BILL DOES SPIKE AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT WE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON. THE AGE OF MEDICAL CONSENT AND WHEN THAT COULD HAPPEN BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT BILL FOR DIFFERENT. CONVERSATIONS AND I APPRECIATE THAT IN YOUR RATE I THINK MANY OF US WOULD PREFERRED THAT THOSE LAWS WERE IN PLACE THAT WE COULD YOU KNOW BE THERE FOR KIDS WHEN THEY MAY NEED US EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT. BE OPEN TO DISCUSSING THE ISSUE BUT I THINK. ALSO THE HEART OF THE BILL IS THAT IT REALLY IS CEILING. THIS WHOLE EVOLUTION INVOLVED SO THAT A PARENT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THEIR CHILD WHILE IT'S TRUE. THAT YOU YOU KNOW EXIST LINE WILL ALLOW THEM TO. THIS CARE WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS KNOWLEDGE THIS BILL. GOES FURTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY- BILLING INFORMATION IS ALSO KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND IS NOT SENT TO THE PARENT. WHO IS THE POLICY HOLDER WHO IS YOU KNOW PAYING FOR THAT INSURANCE POLICY SO IT REALLY DOES. LOCK IT AWAY SO THAT A PARENT. JUST HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S THE CORE ISSUE BUT I APPRECIATE YOU. MAKING THE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. XCERRA LABOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I ALSO THANK HIM FOR HIS CLARIFICATION I DO ALSO THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION IS CONFUSED ON WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY MAY WANT TO CHANGE CURRENT AND EXISTING LAW BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IT IN OPPOSITION ARE PROBABLY THE ONES WHO NEED THIS BILL THE MOST BECAUSE MOST OF THESE PARENTS ARE NOT PARENTS WHO'D BE ACCEPTING. OF THEIR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM SOCIETAL NORMS YOU'VE ALL HEARD HEARD ME TALK ABOUT MY DAUGHTER WHO IS GAY AND WHEN SHE CAME OUT TO US SHE SAID I ALWAYS KNEW I COULD COME OUT TO YOU BUT YOU'VE PROBABLY ALSO HEARD ME TALK ABOUT HER FRIENDS FRIENDS THAT WE KNEW WHOSE PARENTS KICK THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE WHEN THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE GAY SO ALL FAMILIES AREN'T LOVING ALL FAMILIES AREN'T ACCEPTING AND THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED I WISH WE LIVED IN A WORLD WHERE EVERY FAMILY ACCEPTED THEIR CHILD THE WAY THEY WORK. BUT THE FACT IS WE JUST DON'T SO THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. RUBIO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I'M- GLAD THAT HE CLARIFIED. THE ISSUE AT HAND AND THAT EXISTING MEDICAL CONSENT. DOESN'T CHANGE. BUT I ALSO WANTED JUST TO SHARE IT YOU KNOW. THIS BUT JUST SIMPLY. GIVES PATIENTS THE ABILITY TO MAKE BETTER HEALTH. CHOICES AND BETTER HEALTH CHOICES CLEARLY MAKE FOR YOU KNOW HEALTHIER LIVE. LONGER LIVES- I ALSO VERY PLEASED THAT THE AUTHOR INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. I IT X. BANSTEAD TO INCLUDE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE WHICH IS I BELIEVE IS ALSO VERY CRITICAL. AS A SURVIVOR MYSELF. AN ADVOCATE FOR VICTIMS I DO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP SOME OF THE SERVICES. CONFIDENTIAL SADLY AND TOO OFTEN. TOP VIOLENT PARTNERS WILL RESORT TO REPRODUCTIVE COURSE OF CONTROL WHICH MEANS LITERALLY. MAKING EVERY DECISION FOR THE VICTIM THEIR PARTNER. AND DIE FOLLOWING. THESE VICTIMS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND GET THE CARE THEY NEED WITHOUT FEAR OF. RETALIATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR IN MY- OPINION THIS MAY MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE. OR DEATH FOR SO MANY OF THESE VICTIMS- AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT- YOU KNOW I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONCERNS. OF THE OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW SOME. I'M NOT A PARENT SO I WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND BUT I DON'T WANT TO VALIDATE SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS BUT I JUST THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AND- AND IT'LL HELP SO MANY PEOPLE AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND THE TEAR FOR WORKING OUT SOME AT THE- ABBEY THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCES AND- CAME TO A CONCLUSION TO RECENT AMENDMENTS AND WITH THAT. I'D LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTION OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES- CENTER ADMIN. THANK YOU BUT JUST ALSO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I HAVE A I HAVE A TWELVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. AND CERTAINLY CAN UNDERSTAND- HOW PEOPLE START GETTING NERVOUS AS THEIR AS THEIR KIDS DEVELOPING GROW. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND. THAT KIDS NEED TO HAVE SAFE PLACES TO GO. AND PEOPLE THEY TRUST THAT MY DAUGHTER HAD A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION WITH MY WIFE THE OTHER DAY- AND- OUR BIG TAKEAWAY WAS IT. WAS WASN'T THAT WASN'T A GREAT DISH YOU CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ALL NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK IS TO HAVE. RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR KIDS WHERE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TO US- AND UNDERSTANDING SOMETIMES AND TRUSTING IN THEM AND IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. THAT THAT THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK AROUND AND- AND POWER. ARE IN A- RESPONSIBLE WAY GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. THIS IS ABOUT ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND NOBODY WOULD ARGUE WITH THAT FAX I WOULD THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL- MY SELF ON BEHALF LGBT CAUCUS AS WELL. AND ASKED TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. A THE CENTRE MELINDA'S YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN JUST WITH RESPECT AND DEFERENCE TO THE AUTHOR WHO IS- HERE I JUST WANT TO OFFER AN APOLOGY TO THE CALLERS. WHO CALLED IN IN OPPOSITION I KNOW THERE ARE SOME DEROGATORY COMMENTS MADE ABOUT. HOW THEY FEEL WHAT'S IN THEIR HEART WHAT KIND OF PARENT THEY ARE AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THIS COMMITTEE CERTAINLY. WOULD KNOW WHAT TYPE OF PARENT THEY ARE OR WHAT'S IN THEIR HEARTS I JUST WANTED TO OFFER THAT APOLOGY THANK YOU. I THANK THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SAYING NONE- NO FURTHER COMMENTS AT A CENTER TO OFFER SO I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH- OUR COMMITTEE AND- ALSO I THINK SPONSORS STUFF THAT. AND TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS- WE DID TRY TO ADDRESS IT BY MAY NOTE THAT WHEN THE OPPOSITION IS THAT WAS THE HEALTH PLANS IS TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT BIRDS BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT TO. THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN OBLIGATION FOR NON SENSITIVE SERVICES AS WELL IF THOSE SERVICES- A POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING FOR THAT PATIENT SO NO THEORY HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF MECHANISM. TO TRY TO ADDRESS EVEN ON SENSITIVE SERVICES AS WELL IN PLACE BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LAW SO WE DID WANT TO SIMPLIFY THINGS FOR THEM WITH THE AMENDMENTS- IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY HAD TO DO- BUT- ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT BY FEDERAL LAW THEY ALSO HVE TO HAVE THAT A SIMILAR MECHANISM IN PLACE AND SO WE COULD LINE THOSE TOGETHER- SO HOPEFULLY THAT. DAY SO- HOPEFULLY THAT DID HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THAT IS CERTAINLY- I KNOW I KNOW THAT- YOU SOMEONE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE- THE HEALTH PLANS IF THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE TO HELP- STILL IMPLEMENT WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE WHILE. ADDRESSING IT THERE'S NO OTHER TECHNICAL ISSUES BUT I THINK WE TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT IN THOSE AMENDMENTS I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- YOU KNOW I'M A PEDIATRICIAN AND A PARENT OF A TEEN AND PRETEEN- SO. AND SO AS PETERSON OF COURSE TAKE CARE OF- MANY TEENAGERS- I I'VE HEARD THAT BUT BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THAT I WANNA KNOWLEDGE WHAT RUBIO SAID THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE KIDS THAT WE SIR TALK ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HOW UNFORTUNATELY THIS INFORMATION COULD BE USED- TO ACTUALLY- FOR. THE INCREASE CAN- IN MESSED VIOLENCE SO WE TO REGRET. THE WE NEED TO GIVE THOSE TOOLS- TO PATIENTS SO THEY HAVE THOSE TOOLS. BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF- CHILDREN YOU KNOW- WHEN I SEE A CHILD NAME WANTS TO DISCLOSE SOMETHING TO ME- AS IN A VISIT. IN PRIVACY I DO ALWAYS ENCOURAGE THEM TO DISCUSS IT WITH THEIR PARENTS. ALL RIGHT. I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN THAT'S IDEAL. BUT THE SAME TIME- WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF THEY KNEW THERE WASN'T THE PRIVACY AND THAT AND NOT SAY ONLY DID IT WITH THEIR PERMISSION THEY WOULD DISCLOSE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND WHAT DO KNOW IS THAT. CHILDREN IF THEY CAN GET ADULT GUIDANCE ARE GONNA MAKE BETTER DECISIONS. SO THE ISSUE THEN BECOMES. WELL IF THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH AND I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN YOU KNOW THE PARENTS YOU ALWAYS WANT YOUR CHILD TO COME TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING BUT LET'S FACE IT THAT'S NOT REALITY ALL THE TIME RIGHT FOR WHATEVER. REASONS DYNAMICS MARISSA NET DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH. A JUDGMENT ON TERMS OF. WHAT THE OTHER PARENTS CARE FOR THAT CHILD. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEENAGERS RATE AND- AND ADOLESCENTS ARE GOING UP TRYING TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND SOMETIMES THEY JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TELLING US AS PARENTS. BUT WE BASICALLY CLOSE OFF ALL AVENUES FOR THEM TODAY AND TALK TO ANOTHER ADULT WHERE DATA PRIVACY CAN BE MAINTAINED. INCLUDING PHYSICIANS OR HEALTH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THAT ACTUALLY CAN LEAD TO POOR DECISIONS BEING MADE AND ALSO- ENDANGERED THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WELL. AND SO I THINK pLAWS. THAT BY THE WAY IS AS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR THAT ALREADY PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THOSE POLICIES WERE ESTABLISHED FOR GOOD REASON. TO GET TO HELP SUPPORT- TO. USE BUT ALSO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE SITUATION THEN FOREIGN MINISTRY TO FLEE THROUGH THE HEALTH PLAN THAT BASICALLY UNDERMINES THOSE PARTICULAR PRIVACY LAWS. AND THAT'S WHY TO ME THIS BILL SO VERY IMPORTANT. AND REALLY APPRECIATE- YOU SIMPLY MEMBER FOR BEING AFFORDED YOUR SPONSORS RAY FORD AND WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU WELL. I THINK MANY OF YOU HAVE STATED. WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY MY CLOTHES THAT I FIRST WELL AGAIN JUST FOR MUCH WANT TO. THE AND YOUR ENGAGE. IN AND THE PLANS- AS THEY KNOW WE'VE WORKED FOR MANY MONTHS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED- WE THOUGHT WE HAD GOTTEN THERE AND THEN IN THE LAST- IN RECENT DAYS WE REALIZE THERE'S THIS ONE LAST ISSUE PARTICULARLY TO. ENSURE THAT- AS REPORTING THIS IN PLACE FOR DOING THIS WITH. AS MUCH ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND SIMPLICITY AS WE CANCEL PREVIEW THE TEACHERS ENGAGEMENT WITH- WITH OUR COALITION TO. TO ENSURE THAT AND- ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ON THAT FRONT- AS IT WAS POINTED OUT BY THE GOOD SENATOR FROM THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY- THIS BILL IS NOT JUST ABOUT- ENSURING. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BY BY YOUNG PEOPLE WE WANT TO ASSURE THAT ADULTS WHO ARE IN. OR HAVE EXPERIENCED VIOLENCE IN INTIMATE PARTNER. VIOLENCE SITUATIONS FAMILY VIOLENCE DOMESTIC VIOENCE. ALL THAT THEIR HEALTH SERVICES ARE CONFIDENTIAL. IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE ON THE HEALTH PLAN OF THEIR- IF THEIR PARTNER- BUT TO ALL THE PARENTS. WHO HAVE TAKEN PART IN THIS DISCUSSION- FOR ME AGAIN AS A PARENT AND I KNOW THIS IS TRUE FOR. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON AND FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IF HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. HI AND MANY MAY BE IN. CHALLENGING SITUATIONS AT HOME- IF THEY ARE. L. G. B. T. Q. USE IF THEY ARE- STRUGGLING WITH- WITH WITH DIFFERENT ELEMENTS- RELATED TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THAT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE- AND IT'S BIG AND IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THIS DOESN'T PREVENT- FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDER FROM HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE PARENTS- BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT. IF A MINOR- CAN CONSENT TO A SENSE OF SERVICE WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS AND COMMUNICATIONS THE BILLS. SHOULD ALSO BE CONFIDENTIAL SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION- HOPE THAT- FOLKS CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS.

THE CDC IS FOUND THATRACISM AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS CONTRIBUTED TO FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH INEQUITIES. AND DISPARITIES IN LIFE EXPECTANCY. THIS FANDOM BECAUSE FURTHER EXPOSED AND EXACERBATED THESE INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IN PARTICULAR pTHAT BLACK CLOUD NECKS AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK OF EXPOSURE ILLNESS HOSPITALIZATION. AND SADLY DEATH RELATIVE TO THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION. CURRENTLY OUR STATE IS LIMITED ON HEALTH QUALITY DATA AND THESE METRICS ARE NEEDED TO BEGIN ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES. TO COLLECT MORE DATA ON PATIENT HEALTH OUTCOMES BY RACE ETHNICITY AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFOGRAPHICS AB TROUBLE FOR. FOR CAR HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL EQUITY REPORT.

BOTTLES AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE CERTAINLY IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO ADDRESS HEALTH INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES. HOWEVER THE INEQUALITIES THAT EXIST IN HEALTH CARE ARE MORE THAN JUST A HOSPITAL ISSUE. ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE THE CRITICAL FACTOR THAT MANY IN HOSPITAL AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS WORKED HARD ON BUT WE NEED ALL PROVIDERS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING ALL OF THE REASONS. WHY HELPING EQUITIES EXAM. I HOSPITAL- ENTITY TO THE- AND IMPLEMENTING A HEALTH EQUITY PLANS WITHOUT PARTICIPATION BY OTHERS IN THE HEALTH CARE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES DELIVERY SYSTEMS WILL ONLY SHOW A PORTION OF THE ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY WAYS TO ADVANCE. TO THE BAND'S RACIAL EQUITY SUPPORT FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. PART OF THIS EFFORT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES IS LOOKING TO DEVELOP STANDARDS FOR DATA COLLECTION QUALITY MEASURES. BY RACE ETHNICITY ETHNICITY DISABILITY STATUS L. G. B. T. Q. PLUS INSERT YOUR ECONOMIC STATUS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE EFFORTS ALIGN WITH THE NATIONAL ACTIVITY AND UNICORN DATA SETS IN METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING HEALTH DISPARITY IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. A NEW AMENDMENT THREE NEW ISSUE. THE AMENDMENT PRETTY SUPPOSED TO PRIMARK THAT MAY NOT ALIGN WITH FEDERAL EFFORTS. WE HAD ENVISIONED THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WOULD LOOK AT WHICH MAJOR TO COLLECT WHO TO COLLECT FROM IN OTHER EFFORTS AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL WELL WE SUPPORT AN AMENDMENT TO CONVENE A HEALTHCARE EQUITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS.

LEAVE SO OKAY YES ALL RIGHT SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TEN EIGHTY THIRTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BY SUMMER MAHER CG WELCOME PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AT THIRTEEN FIFTY EIGHT. WHICH IS A BILL THAT- WILL REQUIRE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS TO COLLECT AND SHARE PUBLIC HEALTH DATA. USING STANDARDIZED AND DISAGGREGATED DATA- BASED ON RACE ETHNICITY AND LANGUAGE. WE SAW THERE IN THIS PANDEMIC. THE TREMENDOUS DISPARITIES- IN THE IMPACT OF COVER NINETEEN NOT ONLY ALONG RACIAL LINES BUT WITHIN RACIAL GROUPS ALONG- APNIC LINES. BUT THIS WAS MOST STARKLY EVIDENT IN THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES WHERE. ACCORDING TO A USE- RECENT UCLA- HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH REPORT. THE RATES FOR NATIVE HAWAIIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS WAS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AVERAGE- FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THIS WAS MASKED BY THE DATA A PROVIDING INDICATING THAT THE RATES FOR ALL ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS WAS LOWER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE AND SO THIS. IS JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW WE NEED TO HAVE. MORE DATA DRIVEN PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSES TO INSURE THAT WE ARE EFFECTIVELY DEPLOYING- OUTREACH AND RESOURCES INCLUDING VACCINATIONS TESTING AND TREATMENT. THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH NO NO VOTES NO OPPOSITION- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE- DR KIM RHODES. ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF EPITOME EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TO CLOCK CHIEF DEPUTY AT THE ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANKS SO MUCH CENTER MESSAGE THE MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE KIM RHODES FROM UCSF SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND TWO QUOTES FROM ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES- I GUESS WE'LL TAKE THEM IN THE ORDER THAT THE AUTHOR HAS LISTED THEM SO BEGIN WITH THAT KIM RHODES. TWO MINUTES APIECE. I THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HELP COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS DR KIM WROTE THEM A PHYSICIAN DISPARITIES RESEARCHER AND FOUNDER OF THE MOTOR HEALTH PARTNERS THE COMMUNITY LED TO THE NINETEEN KEPT THE CARE AND VACCINATION COLLABORATIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE FOCUS ON INCREASING HEALTH EQUITY IN THE CONTROL THE PANDEMIC THROUGH DIRECT SERVICE DELIVERY AND pCOMMUNITY ADVOCACY ABOUT CAPACITY BUILDING. AS YOU HAVE JUST HEARD THE PANDEMIC HAS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND DISAGGREGATED DATA COLLECTION IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE ROOT CAUSES OF THESE DISPARITIES- IF WE DON'T COLLECT AND MAKE THE DATA AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT- THEY WILL BE HAMSTRUNG IN THEIR ABILITY TO EQUITABLY AND EFFICIENTLY ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND IN THEIR ABILITY TO DEVELOP SURGICALLY TARGETED PRECISION PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION. AT AN EXAMPLE OF THE START OF THE PANDEMIC AS YOU JUST HEARD AGGREGATED DATA WITH TELLING US THAT- API CODE INFECTION RATES WERE LOW BUT PULLING IT APART IF WE HADN'T WE WOULDN'T NEED TO SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED T. THREE AND T. B. POLITY RATE IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT WAS HIDDEN. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY- AGGREGATING RATES FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY CONTACT TO INITIALLY MISSED INTERVENTION ON THE AFRICAN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY AND MANY OF THESE IMMIGRANTS SERVE AN ESSENTIAL WORKER JOB DRIVING IN THE RIGHT SURE DID GET CONNIE WHICH IS AT A VERY HIGH RISK GROUP THAT DID NOT RECEIVE TARGETED MITIGATION AFRICA UNTIL EARLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE A YEAR INTO THE PANDEMIC. USING AGGREGATED DATA THE VACCINE EFFORT WE WOULD HAVE MISSED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATES OF VACCINATION THE FILIPINO COMMUNITY AND WHY DOES THIS MATTER I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BECAUSE FILIPINO PEOPLE REPRESENT TWENTY PER TWENTY PERCENT- THE- ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER SUBGROUP IN CALIFORNIA BUT 3240% OF THE KOBE DASH. AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. I TO ME- COUNTRY TO THE- I THE FRONT LINE OF HELP PHILIP P. ONLY READ. FOUR PER OF THE NEW WORK. BUT IT REPRESENTED PERCENT OF THE NURSES WHO DIED FROM KOBE. THAT WE FAIL TO ADVANCE THIS LEGISLATION ON DISAGGREGATED DATA COLLECTION- WE WILL BE LIMITED MISDIRECTED AND RESOURCES WILL BE INEFFICIENTLY DISBURSED. AND WE MAY ALSO SEE DIMINISHING VACCINE ACCESS AND REDUCTION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES NEEDED. TO BE CODED IN THE HARD HIT BUT HIDDEN POPULATION. ADD MORE TRANSMISSIBLE DELTA VARIANT GAINS A FOOTHOLD IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST REALLY COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT PERSISTENCE OF THE PANDEMIC IN ANY COMMUNITY IS THE RISK OF PERSISTENCE OF THE PANDEMIC FOR THE REST OF THE STATE. IT IS FOR THE TREATMENT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS I'M AT THIRTEEN FIFTY EIGHT. THANK YOU NOW THE BRING ON. TO CALL AFFIRMATION HEALTH SERVICES- YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND ABOUT.

RIGHT THE BILLS CURRENTLY FOUR ZERO WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL RIGHT AND I THINK I SEE SIMILAR GABRIEL- WELCOME. ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN EIGHTY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO BY SOME MEMBER GABRIEL WELCOME PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ASSISTANCE WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AND I ALSO WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION FOR THEIR OPENNESS TO DISCUSSING THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS. AND FOR WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS THEIR REMAINING CONCERNS. I'M PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AT FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO WHICH WOULD MPROVE PATIENT CARE AND SAFETY AND INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY. BY STRENGTHENING THE PROCESS AROUND PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUESTS. AS AN INITIAL MATTER LIKE TO NOTE THAT STAFFING RATIOS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN PROTECTING BOTH NURSES AND PATIENTS. AS RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THEY CAN LITERALLY SAVE PATIENTS LIVES WHILE ALSO PROTECTING NURSES FROM INJURY AND ILLNESS. I ALSO KNOW THIS FIRST HAND FOR MY MOM IN EXCEPTIONALLY COMPASSIONATE REGISTERED NURSE WHO SPENT YEARS CARING FOR EVERYONE FROM NEWBORN BABIES TO ELDERLY CANCER PATIENTS. AS MY MOM TELLS IT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HER HOSPITAL WAS SO LEAN WE STAFFED BUT SHE WORRIED THA EVEN TAKING A QUICK RESTROOM BREAK WOULD PUT HER PATIENTS AT RISK. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE IN RECENT YEARS SOME HOSPITALS HAVE SOUGHT TO USE PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUEST TO CIRCUMVENT STAFFING RATIOS THEREBY PLACING PATIENTS NURSES AND THE COMMUNITY AT RISK. AT FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO SIX TO DRESS THIS ISSUE BY MAKING A NUMBER OF COMMON SENSE REFORMS TO PROGRAM FACTS ABOUT THE REQUEST. MOST IMPORTANTLY GIVING OUR FRONT LINE NURSES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT ON CHRISTMAS CRITICAL HOSPITAL SAFETY DECISIONS. EIGHTY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO ALSO INCREASES TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AROUND THE PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY PROCESS. CONSISTENT WITH THE BASIC NOTION THAT DECISIONS WHICH IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. SHOULD NOT BE HIDDEN FROM PATIENTS OR THE PUBLIC. AS WE HAVE ALL OBSERVED OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE HEROES HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH TO OUR COMMUNITIES OVER THE PAST YEAR. AT A BARE MINIMUM WE OWE THEM THE BASIC COURTESY OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE IN DECISIONS. WHICH CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THEIR HEALTH SAFETY AND LIVELIHOODS IN ADDITION TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR PATIENTS. AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE A LONG HISTORY. OF FIGHTING FOR WORKERS AND SERVING OUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING SEIU CALIFORNIA YOU NOT ASK ME AND THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WITH ME TODAY IS ANALOGY FROM S. A. U. CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANKS VERY MUCH SENATOR GABRIEL- MODERATOR PLEASE BE ON THE LINE MATT LUCE FROM SEIU. CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES- PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MET WITH JAY ABOUT THE SEIU CALIFORNIA THE PRODUCT WAS SPONSORS AT FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO. FIRST I LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL FOR BEING A CHAMPION FOR NURSES AND OFFERING. A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO ONE CREW TRANSPARENCY UP PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUESTS AND SURE THAT NURSES ALWAYS HAVE A VOICE IN DECISIONS THAT IMPACT THEIR WORK. WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS THE BILL IS A CRUCIAL STEP TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY- QUESTION UP ON FOR MY PATIENT CARE AND SAFETY. OPEN A PUBLIC HEALTH CURRENTLY CONSIDERS IN GRANTS PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REFLECTS YOU HOSPITALS WHAT HOSPITAL WOULD LIKE TO MEET A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THROUGH ALTERNATIVE METHODS. ARE BILL FOCUSES ON A SUBSET PROGRAM POSSIBLY REFLECT THE IMPACT NURSING CARE. ENSURES THAT NURSES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK UP WHEN C. PH CONSIDERING THESE REQUESTS. THE BILL PROVIDES FOR A THIRTY DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD SO THAT NURSES ADVOCATES FOR THEIR PATIENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS. ON PATIENT. CARE FROM THE PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY. WE SAW DURING THE NINETY PENNED THEM THAT FLEXIBILITY- REQUESTS WERE GRANTED WITHOUT PROPER NOTIFICATION OF NURSES AT THE BEDSIDE AND THIS BILL ENSURES THAT NURSES ARE NOTIFIED ABOUT THESE CHANGES THAT MAY IMPACT. THE BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN- THAT NECESSARY PUBLIC COMMENT IN EXPEDIENCY WHEN IT IS WARRANTED BY PROVIDING FOR EXPEDITED PATHWAY SO BACK. UP EMERGENCY OUTSIDE OF HOSPITALS CONTROL HE PH CAN GRANT TEMPORARY PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY WITHOUT A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD WE HAVE MORE CLOUT RELIEF WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY WILL HURT THEIR OPPOSITION. AT FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO IS NEEDED TO BRING TRANSPARENCY TO PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY REQUESTS ENSURES THAT NURSES CAN ADVOCATE FOR THEIR PATIENTS WHEN THE STATE CONSIDERS THESE REQUESTS. FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE BY. AT FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO THANK YOU.
