RIGHT FIRST UP WE HAVE A READ OF NUMBER ONE AGAIN WE'LL TAKE HIS OF COMMITTEE A. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER. BEFORE I START MY PRESENTATION I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL AND I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED WITHIN THE COMMITTEE REPORT THANK YOU. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY WILL HELP CALIFORNIA CONSUMER SAFEGUARD OPIOID MEDICATIONS AND REDUCE THE ACT OF PILFERING A POWERFUL ON RAMP TO THE NATION'S CURRENT OPIOID ADDICTION CRISIS THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE PHARMACISTS TO PROVIDE SCHEDULED TO END TO END PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SUCH AS MORPHINE OXYCODONE AND RITALIN IN A LOCKABLE CONTAINER. OFFERING THE ACT OF SNEAKING A SMALL NUMBER OF PILLS HOPING IT WILL GO UNDETECTED IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF YOUTH OPIOID ABUSE. STUDIES SHOW THAT EACH YEAR NEARLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND SEVENTEEN INITIATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE BY PILFERING MEDICATION FROM AN ADULT IN THEIR HOME. THE OUT DATED CHILD RESISTANT PRESCRIPTION VIALS CURRENTLY IN USE HAVE NOT BEEN MODIFIED IN NEARLY FIFTY YEARS. WHEN THE FEDERAL POISON PREVENTION PACKAGING ACT WHICH WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THE GOAL WAS TO PREVENT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE FROM GAINING ACCESS TO ASPEN. TODAY THOSE SAME CHILD LOCKS ARE USED TO PROTECT MEDICATIONS RANGING FROM COUGH MEDICINE TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MANAGEMENT MEDICATIONS THAT ARE EIGHTY TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE. WE PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CALLED FOR IMPROVED PACKAGING OF OPIOIDS AND OTHER ADDICTIVE MEDICATIONS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. REQUIRING LOCKING PRESCRIPTION VIALS FOR POWERFUL NARCOTICS IS A LOW COST WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO MODERNIZE THE ANTIQUATED FEDERAL LAWS THAT ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING THE NATIONWIDE EPIDEMIC. WITH ME TODAY ARE MARK BURKE GAS WITH AND BE ADVOCACY AND SHERRY DAILY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS. THANK YOU SO I DO HAVE TO SUPPORT WITNESSES BOTH- INDICATED TO BE ON THE TELEPHONE SHERRY DAILY FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS. AND MARK FORGET FROM M. B. ADVOCACY. IS DALY OR MR BIRKHEAD ARE YOU ON THE LINE. THIS IS MARK GO AHEAD SIR. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ACCORDING TO RECENT STUDIES MOST THE RECENT STUDIES FROM THE- PEDIATRICS JOURNAL- ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ADOLESCENTS BEGIN ABUSING. PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS EVERY YEAR THAT COMES OUT YOU KNOW WHAT NEW NEW ADOLESCENT EVERY MINUTE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. EIGHTY FOURTEEN THIRTY CAN PARTIALLY ELIMINATE- THIS EXPERIMENTATION BY ELIMINATING PILFERING WHICH IS AT THE AUTHOR INDICATED TAKING JUST A FEW PILLS AT A TIME. THIS BILL HAS THREE MAIN POINTS NUMBER ONE IT ALERT THE PATIENT. THAT THE MEDICATION THEY'RE RECEIVING IS A SERIOUS MEDICATION- THAT NEEDS TO BE TREATED APPROPRIATELY. NUMBER EXACTLY THE DISINCENTIVES. TO PILFERED THAT MEDICATION- AND NUMBER THREE IF QUICKLY ALERTS WHOEVER IS. HOLDING THE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION THAT THEIR MEDICATIONS HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH AND AS WE KNOW FROM HISTORY THE EARLIER WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT SOMEONE IS BEGINNING TO ABUSE- A MEDICATION OR DRUGS THE BETTER THEIR CHANCES OF HAVING A LONG TERM. POSITIVE OUTCOMES- THESE NUMBERS ARE ALL PRE PANDEMIC NUMBERS AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR EVERY STUDY THAT'S BEEN OUT THERE RECENTLY AT THAT THESE. THE USES AND ABUSES OF THIS MEDICATION HAS INCREASED GEOMETRICALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND KIDS ARE AT HOME AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ADDITIONAL TO DO. AS THE AUTHOR INDICATES THE LOCKABLE FILES HAVE NOT BEEN. UPDATED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. AND THIS IS SIMPLY THE NEXT STEP. IN INCREASING AT THE PROTECTION OF THE USE OF THESE MEDICATIONS. R. COSTA- FACTOR IS VERY SMALL- WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT A TYPICAL OPIOID- ONE IN PARTICULAR CALLED NORCO A ONE MONTH SUPPLY WILL RUN YOU ANYWHERE FROM SIX HUNDRED EIGHT DOLLARS THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS THE CURRENT CHILD RESISTANT CAPS COST ABOUT TWENTY CENTS A PIECE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION BE WALKABLE FILED- COST TO PRODUCE THEM WILL BE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE. CENTS A PIECE SO IT'S A VERY SMALL ADDITION TO THE COST IN ADDITION AT THE PHARMACIST WILL BE COMPENSATED FOR THE FULL COST. OF THE FILE. AS WELL AS ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL TIME. HM CONSULTATIONS AND DISPENSING FEE. THIS WILL HAPPEN ON A MONTHLY BASIS- IN IT WILL. THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY SAVE LIVES- BUT IT WILL FULLY COMPENSATE THE PHARMACIST AND THE RETAILERS OR BOTH THE PRODUCT THAT THEY APPLY AS WELL AS THE TIME THAT THEY SPEND WE FEEL THAT WE CAN SAVE MANY LIVES. EIGHT THE DEATH CAMP COSTS IN HEALTHCARE ALL WITH THIS VERY COMMON SENSE APPROACH- AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE DAILY ALIVE. YES I AM THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AUDIBLE CHAIR MEMBERS JERRY DEALING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND ADDICTION COUNSELORS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TO THE PROGRAMS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY RECOVERY RESIDENCES AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN RECOVERY THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'M HERE TODAY TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR A BI FOURTEEN THIRTY BOTH THAT EXPERT IN A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT FIELD AND PERSONALLY AS A PARENT. FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT BLOCKING PILL WHILE TURNING EXPENSIVE AND VERY EFFECTIVE PREVENTION MEASURE CONCERNING YOUNG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS THIS AGE GROUP IS MATURE ENOUGH TO CALCULATED RISK REWARD POSSIBILITIES FOR THEIR ACTIONS STEALING TWO OR THREE PILLS FROM A CONTAINER REPAIR YES TIME IS FAR LESS LIKELY TO BE DETECTED THAN AN ENTIRE CONTAINER OF MEDICATION SUDDENLY GOING MISSING THEREFORE EXPERIMENTINGWITH PHARMACEUTICALS FROM HOME MEDICINE CABINET HAS VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE FROM A PARENTAL PUNISHMENT PERSPECTIVE. BUT FROM A LIFE AND DEATH STANDPOINT CONSEQUENCES FROM THIS BEHAVIOR CAN LITERALLY BE DEADLY INCLUDED IN OUR LETTER OF SUPPORT WITH A NEWS REPORT ABOUT A FAMILY IN INDIANA WHO EXPERIENCED THE TRAGEDY THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN HE'S POWERFUL MEDICATIONS ARE SURE CATHOLIC PARTY AND MIXED WITH ALCOHOL BECKY SAVAGE HAD TWO AMAZING SONS NICK AND JACK WHO LEFT TALKY TALK ABOUT WHEN LATE NOW NIGHT HANG OUT WHEN I CAME HOME FROM COLLEGE TO CELEBRATE YOUNGER BROTHER JACK HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION.

BY REQUIRING PHARMACIES IN MAINTAIN PATIENT PASSCODE FOR THE LOCKABLE VIALS EIGHTY FOURTEEN THIRTY LAW TO CREATE A NETWORK ISSUE. ADDING THE CAPABILITY WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC TO IMPLEMENT MAINTAIN BECAUSE WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A DIFFERENT REPLACE THE TRACK OF THE FACT THAT. ORDER FARMING PEOPLE HAVE TO DEVELOP A NEW ACCOUNTING PROCESS TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE LOCKABLE VIALS MANUFACTURED AND HAVE TO FIGHT WITH THE COP AWAITING TO BE REIMBURSED. IMPLEMENTING THAT THEY'VE BEEN CONSTANTLY FOLLOWING UP WITH MANUFACTURE COMPLETE THE NEW FINANCIAL BURDEN ON PHARMACIES AND DISTRACT THEM PATIENT CARE.

THANK YOU ALL THERE WE NOW MOVE TO OUR ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN AS FAR CARE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THE BILL AND I WANT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THANK YOU TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH PROHIBITS DIFFERENTIAL PRICING ON THE BASIS OF GENDER OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE PINK TAX. WOMEN PAY MORE ON AVERAGE FOR IDENTICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE SIMPLY A DIFFERENT COLOR A PHENOMENA KNOWN AS THE PINK TAX THIS MEANS THE PRICE FOR BEING A WOMAN. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WOMEN ON AVERAGE PAY. 7% MORE FOR GENDERED ITEMS LIKE TOILETRIES AND CLOTHING. THEY ALSO FACE HIGHER PRICES FOR SEEMINGLY NEUTRAL PRODUCTS LIKE MORTGAGE RATES. THESE PRICE DIFFERENCES ATA THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE STUDY ESTIMATED THE YEAR AFTER YEAR. A TYPICAL CALIFORNIA WOMAN PAYS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS MORE. FOR THE SAME GOODS AND SERVICES THAN HER MALE COUNTERPART. THIS ARBITRARILY PENALIZES WOMEN AFTER FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. WOMEN HAVE BEEN HIT HARD IN THIS PANDEMIC. ECONOMIC INEQUITIES BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN HAVE INCREASED. ON THAT JOB LOSSES HAVE BEEN FROM WOMEN AND SPECIFICALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. THESE IMPACTS THREATEN THE WELL BEING OF FAMILIES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. 41% OF MOTHERS WERE THE PRIMARY BREADWINNERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES. PRIMARY BREADWINNERS WHO STILL MAKE 70% OR LESS THAN THEIR MALE COLLEAGUES. THE PINK TAX AUGMENTS AND REINFORCES THESE INEQUITIES WOMEN ALREADY UNDERPAID- EXPECTED TO MAKE PAY MORE FOR BASIC NECESSITIES. THIS BILL STRIKES THE BALANCE WE WORKED HARD TO CRAFT THE BILL WITH PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THE CHAMBERS NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. AND WE PROTECTED SMALL BUSINESSES. FROM BURDENSOME LITIGATION WHILE ALSO HOLDING RETAILERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SYSTEMIC GENDER IMBALANCE IN PRICING. PAYING HIGHER PRICES BECAUSE OF YOUR GENDER IS SIMPLY UNJUST. IT HURTS WOMEN IN A MARKET AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE DEEPLY VULNERABLE. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS TIFFANY BOYD LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. AND JESSICA STENDER SENIOR COUNSEL AT EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO LISTED AS BEING WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. HIS BLADE AND MS STENDER ARE YOU WITH US. YES I'M HERE. OKAY- WILL TAKE EITHER ONE.

A HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND OVER THE COURSE OF HER LIFE IN AN AGGREGATE PENALIZES WOMEN ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO THE TUNE OF FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR WE KNOW THAT WOMEN AND GIRLS IN HERE FACE. ANY QUALITY IN MANY ASPECTS OF THEIR DAILY LIFE NUMBER WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING BY THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WOMEN ARE ALREADY PAID LESS THAN MEN AND WITH THE PINK TAX THEY'RE CHARGED MORE ON TOP OF THAT OUR GREAT EIGHTY EIGHT THAT. FOR EVERY DOLLAR A MAN EARNS THAT AND- THOSE EARNING FALL TO FORTY PORTIONS WERE BROKEN DOWN BY RACE WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR ARE SUFFERING DURING A PANDEMIC I CANNOT AFFORD AGREE HERE ARBITRARY AND REPRESSIVE A TARGET AND THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE YOU ANY THE PINK TAX AND DISCRIMINATORY PRICE SETTING% SUCH AS- AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY DO IT IS A NECESSARY STEP TOWARD TAKE GARDEN EQUAL.

NO ONE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM OPERATOR OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION. FOR AB. TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISHTO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. THERE ARE NO COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THIS CONSULT WITH SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL I SIGNED ON AS A JOINT AUTHORS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN JOINT AUTHORS OF PAST ITERATIONS OF THIS I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED I HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHERE THIS BILL LANDED- I JUST DON'T SEE A ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL FACT. OUTSIDE OF THE IDENTICAL PEAK IN BLUE RAZOR- KIND OF SITUATION WHERE WHERE DO YOU SEE HOW DO YOU SEE THIS WOULD. HAPPENED BE ENFORCED I'M JUST NOT REALLY BIG INTO SAYING WE PASSED LAWS THAT DON'T REALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. I FEEL GIVEN THE KIND OF STRICTNESS OF HOW THIS IS CONSTRUED ALONG WITH THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITY WERE KIND OF SAYING SOMETHING BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY CAN CAN LIVE. RAZOR M. EXAMPLE THAT USED TO BE YEARS AND HONESTLY I WENT CHECKED ISN'T ISN'T A PROBLEM ANYMORE THEY'VE SOLVED THE PINK AND BLUE REYES ARE PROBLEMS AT LEAST IN MY ARE. SO DID YOU TOUCH ON THINGS THEM UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION CRACK ONE IS IMPORTANT. ONE IS THE QUESTION OF. HOW WORKING. AND GENERATE. I THINK. SO THE ENFORCEMENT PERSONALLY YES- SO I MEAN REQUIRE. YOU KNOW IT'S THE IS CURRENTLY CRAFTED HAVE THE ATTORNEY JOHN AS THE ENFORCER OF. AND THE I BELIEVE THE MOST IN. MECHANISM THERE IS AN ENGINE I THINK WE ALL. TO THIS TO BE CORRECTED RIGHT NEAR DRUGS OR IT COULD CRACK THAT'S THE GOAL. AND SO WHAT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM IN THE PAST IS THIS QUESTION OF WILL THERE BE GIVEN HOW COMPLICATED THIS IS BECAUSE I THINK HOPE HI I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT IF SOMETHING IS. MORE EXPENSIVE TO MANUFACTURE WHICH IN SOME CASES WOMEN'S GARMENTS FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO TAYLOR THEN EMAIL GARMENT THAT YOU CAN CHARGE FOR THAT RIGHT FOR THE COST OF THE DIFFERENTIAL IN PRODUCTION OF GOODS. AND SO THIS IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION OF WHERE IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM PRICE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE TO MANUFACTURE THE GOOD AND WHERE IS IT JUST. A GENDER TAX RATE. AND SO THAT. GIVE THE COMPLICATED NATURE OF THAT. YOU KNOW THIS ITERATION OF THE BILL SAYS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENFORCEMENT IS APPROPRIATELY PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- IT IS WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT IS DO WE WANT IT. GIVEN HOW MUCH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO. WE WANT TO EXPAND THAT OUT TO LOCAL CITY ATTORNEYS TO GIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE RIGHT TO DO THIS YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE BAND WITH TO DO THAT SO THAT IS ON THE TABLE AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT I WOULD SUGGEST ADDING THAT BEFORE IT GETS TO APPROACH IT'S FEELING A LITTLE BIT LIGHT- STATEMENT BILL WHICH I'M COOL WITH BUT IT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT- PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH THE KIND OF RELIEF. THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY I DON'T SEE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SPENDING A LOT OF TIME DOING IN JUNCTION FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO. DOLLARS I MEAN. YOU KNOW FOR THAT BEING THE FIND AYE AYE IT JUST. IT'S NICE BUT LIKE IF WE'RE GOING TO PASS A LOT AND SAY WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND LET'S PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING SO I WOULD SUGGEST ADDING SOMEONE FOR SPENT THERE. EVEN IF IT DOES GIVE YOU OPPOSITION. THAT'S FAIR AND YOU WANT ME TO ADDRESS THE OTHER QUESTION. ABOUT THE NARROW NATURE OF THE- I. THINK RIGHT THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CORRECT SEEING RK YOU MAY CALL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THANK YOU I LOOKING FOR A MOTION. ALL RIGHT WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO A SECOND STAVING. THANK YOU AND THAT MOTION IS DUE PASSED AMENDED TO A- KALRA PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE CHAU. CHIU CHOI AYE DAVIES. DAVE AYE CONSULT. CONSOLES I HOLDEN. KALRA CORRECT MANGE. REYES SMITH. THAT BILL NEEDS ONE VOTE I WILL PUT IT ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER. ALL MISS FRIEDMAN WE WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE. HI OF THE LORD HELLO MISTER CHAIRMAN. I WOULD I THINK TELL YOU IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL I AM ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGES TWELVE THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN IN THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU GLOBALLY THE ECOMMERCE INDUSTRY USED TO BE REALLY TWO POINT ONE BILLION THAT'S BILLION WITH A B. POUNDS OF PLASTIC PACKAGING IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND OF THAT E. COMMERCE BUSINESSES IN THE U. S. GENERATED SIX HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE MILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC PACKAGING WASTE. LAST YEAR CONSUMERS SPENT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS ONLINE WITH U. S. MERCHANTS UP WITHALMOST A THIRD OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION NOW BUYING ONLINE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC PACKAGING GENERATED IS ESTIMATED TO DOUBLE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE STAGGERING GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO OUTLIVE THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND IT'S CREATING A WAVE OF PLASTIC PACKAGING WASTE WHICH IS ALSO EAGLE USE AND VERY LITTLE OF WHICH IS RECYCLABLE IT IS ALMOST ALL HEADED TO LANDFILLS INCINERATION OR INTO THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT POLLUTES WATERWAYS. AND OCEANS. I BUY THINGS ONLINE PROBABLY YOU ALL BUY THINGS ONLINE I'M CONSTANTLY SHOCKED AT HOW MUCH PLASTIC PACKAGING COMES WITH ITEMS THAT ARE NOT EVEN FRAGILE OR EASY TO DAMAGE. PLASTIC THAT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO THROW INTO OUR- TRASH BIN I TO GO TO OUR LANDFILLS AND- MEMBERS. IT'S VERY EASY AND CONVENIENT AND CHEAP TO BUY THINGS ONLINE BUT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THE BACK AND COST THAT WE PAY AS REPAIRS. ALL OF US WHO LIVE IN CITIES WITH YOUR TENANT OR YOUR AN OWNER OF A HOUSE YOU'RE PAYING A TRASH FREE THAT IS INCREASINGLY GOING UP. TO REFLECT THE COST THAT YOUR CITY YOUR MISTER POLITY HAS TO BEAR TO DEAL WITH PLASTIC WASTE. NOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION FROM PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT RECYCLABLE WHEN IT COMES IN THOSE BOXES IN FACT I'M STILL HAVING AN ARGUMENT WITH MY ROOMMATES HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO KEEP THROWING PLASTIC FILM IN THE RECYCLE BIN BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WERE TOLD FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS RECYCLE PLASTIC AND IT GETS RECYCLED BUT THAT PLASTIC RIGHT NOW MAYBE RECYCLABLE IN A LAB SOMEWHERE BUT THERE IS NO AGENCY IN ON CALIFORNIA THAT I HAVE FOUND THAT IS CURRENTLY RECYCLING PLASTIC FILM OF ANY KIND SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THIS IS. RIGHT STAFFER HAS DONE IS VERY HANDY CRIB SHEETS. SO IS BAD NOT RECYCLABLE PROBABLY YOU'VE GOTTEN SOME OF THIS I GET TONS OF THIS TONS OF BACK I GOT A PLOT A SKI MASK IN THE MAIL FOR MY DAUGHTER FROM FROM ONE OF THE ONLINE SHOPPERS THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS WRAPPED IN GOBS OF THIS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IN A BOX PRACTICALLY UNTOUCHABLE NOT RECYCLABLE. SEEING ALL OF THESE PLASTIC BAGS NOT RECYCLABLE. WHAT IS RECYCLABLE. THIS IS RECYCLABLE INCLUDING THE TAPE ON THE INSIDE WHICH IS MADE OUT OF PAPER. WHICH IS NOT PLASTIC SO EVEN IF IT'S NOT RECYCLED IT DOES NOT HARM THE ENVIRONMENT IS A GOES INTO THE ENVIRONMENT HERE'S A BOX MADE WITH COMPLETELY RECYCLED AND RECYCLABLE PAPER. PATTERNS FOR MORE MORE OF OUR ONLINE RETAILERS ARE SWITCHING TO THIS TYPE OF PACKAGING AND INVESTING IN IT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THAT BY A DATE CERTAIN IT SAYS YOU CAN NO LONGER USE THE BAD NON RECYCLABLE PLASTIC PACKAGING AND INSTEAD YOU HAVE TO SWITCH TO ONE OF THE MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AS A SHIPPER AT LARGE ONLINE CHIPPER. OF RECYCLABLE NON PLASTIC PACKAGING MEMBERS THIS IS LOW HANGING FRUIT THIS IS A MOVE IT'S ALREADY BEING EMBRACED BY LARGE PORTIONS OF THE INDUSTRY THIS WILL MOVE THEM MAKE THEM MOVE QUICKER IT WILL SEND SIGNALS TO THE MANY CALIFORNIA COMPANIES THAT ARE DEVELOPING EXACTLY THIS KIND OF VERY GOOD ALTERNATIVE PACKAGING. AND IT'S OF IT'S A IT'S AGAIN THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF WASTE TO THAT'S UNNECESSARY COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY IN TODAY'S WORLD THIS IS NOT ADVANCE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE TO DEVELOP AT NASA THIS IS ALREADY HERE IN THE MARKET PLACE AND THERE'S NO EXCUSE TO NOT REQUIRE WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS ALL SHIPPERS TO USE THIS. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE. TO SUPPORT WITNESSES LISTED BOTH ON THE TELEPHONE TERROR BROUGHT. AND LAUREN COLUMN FROM SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA TERROR BRACHER LAUREN CULLIMORE YOU ON THE LINE.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU OPERATOR WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE TO OPPOSITION WITNESSES NOTED ADAM RIGGLE FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND DAWN KEPT ME FROM THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION BOTH AVAILABLE ON THE TELEPHONE. OR THE WITNESSES AVAILABLE. WE ARE HERE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING NUMBER THE COMMITTEE ADAM RAGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE IN THE BILL WITH A LOT OF LONG PANTS. DO YOU THINK PACKAGING WASTE AND POLLUTION OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. OUR GOAL CALCHAMBER SHARES AND A COALITION PARTNER SHARE. CHAMBERS AND WORKING FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON A COMPREHENSIVE AND IMPLEMENTABLE RECYCLING INITIATIVE THAT CREATE AND MARKET. WHICH IS SOURCE REDUCTION AND INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENT IN RECYCLING COMPOSTING INFRASTRUCTURE EIGHT FOUR BY THOSE WHO MANUFACTURE THE PACKAGING IN CALIFORNIA. BUT A BILL AIMED AT REDUCING WEIGHT WE BELIEVE EIGHTY THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE WILL ARBITRARILY BANNED PACKAGE MATERIAL THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING THAT DERIVE UNBROKEN. AND GROW RIGHT SAFETY FOR CONSUMERS FROM LIKE TRONIC MONITORS TV AND HERE'S TO APPLIANCES OVEN REFRIGERATOR THE MICROWAVE. TO EPF PACKING FOR MEDICAL DEVICES IT ALL REQUIRES EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE WE ARE NOT AWARE OF HOW YOU WOULD SHIP A TV LITERALLY A CROP- YOU KNOW HALF THE WORLD TO CALIFORNIA WITHOUT USING EXPAND POLY STYRENE ENSURING THAT THESE PRODUCTS REMAIN UNBROKEN. WE THINK THE BILL ARBITRARILY SET UP IN THE FIRST HALF. A TAKE BACK PROGRAM WHICH DOES GET DRIVING YOUR COLLECTION IMPROPER INDEED MATERIAL ONLY TO THEN ARBITRARILY BANNED ALL OF THAT MATERIAL JUST TWO YEARS LATER WIRING REQUIRING SMALL LARGE AND MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES TO OFF SET UP A KICK BACK ELECTION SYSTEM. IN WHICH WE THEN LITERALLY TWO YEARS LATER BANNED ALL THAT MATERIAL IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND WE DO THINK TAKE BACK PROGRAMS AND ENSURING AND MARKET AND INVESTING IN RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALL IMPORTANT BUT AT AGE THIRTY SEVEN ONE IS ACTUALLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO ACHIEVING ALL OF THAT NECESSARY OVERALL TO OUR SYSTEM. AND THAT COULD BE ANY MATERIALS THAT DO PROVIDE AND MARKET LIKE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- RECYCLED CONTENT PACKAGING CAN'T FOR EXAMPLE THAT AN END MARKET FOR PLASTIC THAT WE I THINK WE SHOULD BE INTENSIFIED IT NOT BANNING- ERR PULLOVER HELD UP AS AN EXAMPLE THAT THAT MIGHT. BETTER THAN 95% AIR PACKAGE IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE THE SAME PROTECTION FOR THAT PRODUCT AND SUBSTITUTED WITH A DIFFERENT MATERIAL YOUR FAMILY TO LOOK AT THE FULL LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS OF NEARLY SHIPPING TENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF PRODUCT. WITH HAVE YOUR PACKAGING THAT WILL REQUIRE MORE FUEL AND MORE GHG EMISSIONS I THINK THE BILL IS WELL INTENDED BUT COMPLETELY MISSES THE MARK AT THE WHAT IS TRULY NEEDED TO REDUCE WASTE REDUCE PLASTIC POLLUTION AND ACHIEVE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN OTHER REASONS WE OPPOSE THE. BILL I CAN'T GET ALL OF THAT OUR TODAY IN A FEW MINUTES HAVE BEEN ON BUT WOULD LOVE ANSWER ANY. THAT WITH THE- ON- WAIT WE THINK WOULD BE A MORE. WAY OF AT THE- LAW INTENT AS THEY GET THEIR SEVENTY ONE- WE WERE. ASK FOR ANOTHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITH KATHY. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBER DON HAPPY WITH ME Q. CAT THE FIFTY ON BEHALF TELL FOR MANY AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE AB IS NOTED AT A BY A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALCHAMBER SEE MPA AND ITS MEMBERS AGREE THAT INCREASED APPLETS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE PACKAGING MATERIAL IS RECYCLABLE AND APPROPRIATELY RECOVERED AND RECYCLED. TO THAT END IF YOU CAME UP MEMBERS OF SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST THREE YEARS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CALCHAMBER AND OUR COLLEAGUE ORGANIZATIONS DEVELOPING A WORKABLE FRAMEWORK FOR THE RECOVERY AND RECYCLING OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING MATERIALS AS WELL AS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP POLICY TEAM CENTRALIZED NEW DOMESTIC MARKET TO RECYCLE MATERIALS IMPROVED PACKAGING DESIGNED TO INCREASE RECYCLABILITY AND DEVELOP VALUE CHAIN FINANCING FOR COLLECTING AND STORING VARIOUS PACKAGING FORMATS. WILL SEEM J. PRESHEAF THE INTENSITY. THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE. LEAVE THAT IS IMPORTANT A POLICY OF TAKES IN ACCOUNT THE NECESSARY WILL AFTER G. SEND. AND PROTECTING. EXCEPT INSTEAD. AND MULTI OF AN- AFTER SUCH AS RECYCLE. WE PREVENT MATERIALISES. ENERGY EMISSIONS RELATED TO VARIOUS PACKAGE MATERIALS AND ARRIVED A SOLUTION- MAKES SENSE ENVIRONMENTALLY WHILE PROVIDING THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND BROADER SUPPLY CHAIN BUT PRACTICAL AND IMPLEMENTABLE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTY THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE INCLUDE STAMP ON SOME PACKING MATERIALS USED FOR SHIPPING BUT FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AND IN FACT COULD VERY WELL LEAD TO INCREASE WAGES WERE SOLD THE PRODUCT BREAKAGE OR SPOILAGE. AT THE SAME TIME AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE THING OF THESE MATERIALS IT SEEMS TO ALSO REQUIRE TAKE BACK PROGRAMS BEATS JOBLESS FOR THE SAME PACKAGING ITEMS THAT WOULD BE BANNED. FURTHER AS AMENDED THE PENALTY STRUCTURES EVEN MORE CONCERNING OF THE MANDATE OF REMAINS UNCLEAR IN SOME RESPECTS BUT PENALTIES BEING RAISED TO A LEVEL THAT IS NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT PROTECTION NEEDS. TO AVOID. INCREASED WASTE ANY COMMERCE. I AB THIRTY SEVEN TAKES A PUNITIVE. RATHER THAN FOR ON MARK FROM BURKE AND RISK AND- HIM K. IT'S MEMBERS UNDER. THEY NEED TO PLAYING YOUR REDUCTION RECYCLING EXTINGUISH PACKAGING WASTE PUT INTO THE MARKET PLACE. TO THAT END CMJ LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND LEGISLATURE TO CRAFTING APPROACH FOR SINGLE USE PACKAGING THAT IS WORKABLE AND IMPLEMENTABLE. AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE UNFORTUNATELY WILL ONLY SEEK TO INCREASE WASTE AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT CALIFORNIA BASED MANUFACTURERS WHO MANUFACTURE AND USE THE PACKAGING THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE BILL. FOR THESE REASONS CMJ MUST REMAIN OPPOSED AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE I RESPECTFULLY URGES THE NO VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE ALLY I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WHAT IS RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF TRASH TALK. EARLIER. I DO THINK THAT- THANK YOU TO HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND SECOND AND THE SECOND THANK YOU BIZRATE'S CONTINUE. I THINK THAT- THE THING. THE PRESENTATION OF WHAT IS- WHAT IS AND IS NOT RECYCLABLE I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA EXPERT I WOULD BE FOR SHAKE THE EXPERTISE OF ALL OF MY ROOMMATES. THANK YOU OTHER. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT SEE THAT THANK YOU THIS FRIEDMAN FOR BRINGING THIS AND I DO SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT THERE ARE CONSTANTLY BILLS MOVING TO TRY TO DRESS PLASTICS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEY NEVER GET ANYWHERE WE HEAR THE SAME THING- WE AGREE WITH YOU BUT IT'S NOT THIS WE AGREE WITH YOU JUST NOT THAT JUST NOT THIS JUST NOT THAT WELL THEN WHAT IN IN IN THE END WE KEEP THROWING RESPONSIBILITY. ON PUBLIC AGENCIES WHO RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE TAXPAYERS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THAT. THAT THE CLEAN UP THE RECOVERY RECYCLING EVERYTHING AND- IT'S LONG PAST TIME THAT THE INDUSTRY ACTUALLY COME FORWARD WITH SOMETHING TO HELP. THEY'RE THE ONES MAKING THE MONEY OFF OF THESE PRODUCTS IN THIS DISTRIBUTION. THEY NO LONGER DISAGREE COMPLETELY BUT YET NOTHING IS QUITE GOOD ENOUGH I THINK THIS IS A FINE BILL APPRECIATE THE- THE WORK THAT YOU. ARE PUTTING INTO IT. AND- RECEIVE THE- THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS TO US TODAY. RIGHT WITHOUT YOU MAY CLOSE I'M IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU I WANTED TO MAYBE ADDRESS A FEW OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION BUT I'LL TAKE YOUR PICTURE. WHATEVER YOU YOU CAN CLOSE IN ANYWHERE YOU LIKE WELL I DO APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW THE RESPECTFUL CALLS- FROM THE CHAMBER AND FROM OTHERS AND WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO ANYBODY ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS MORE WORKABLE I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS LOW HANGING FRUIT AND SOME OF THE- THE CLAIMS THAT WERE MADE JUST AREN'T BORNE OUT BY WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN THE MARKETPLACE- TELEVISIONS AND OTHER BREAKABLE- ELECTRONICS WERE BROUGHT UP. SAM SONG NO LONGER USES PLASTIC OR POLYSTYRENE THEIR PACKAGING THEY USED TO FOR A KIND OF FOAM- MOLDED- CARDBOARD FOR THEIR TELEVISIONS AND THEIR BREAKABLE ELECTRONICS- SO THE INDUSTRY IS ALREADY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION THEY'RE SHOWING NOT IN THE FUTURE BUT RIGHT NOW EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE EVEN FOR VERY BREAKABLE OBJECTS. WE HAVE LIMITED THIS TO LARGE ONLINE RETAILERS I THINK IT MAYBE IS TELLING THAT ONE OF THE LARGEST ONLINE RETAILERS HAS NOT YET- COME IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION VERY RAPIDLY AND KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE ARE LOOKING FOR. A WAY TO THE WERE THE TALK ABOUT US INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RECYCLING AND I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE IT SHOULDN'T BE ON PUBLIC AGENCIES AND CONSUMERS AND RATEPAYERS TO PAID UP ALL THE BURDEN OF THIS AND IT EVERY TIME IS LEGISLATURE IS TRIED TO HAVE MORE PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY AND SHIPPER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRASH THAT THEY ARE LITERALLY DUMPING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE THEY THEY DON'T SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS AND. THOSE BILLS VERY RARELY MAKE IT THROUGH. AND THIS MAN. IS NOT RECYCLABLE THERE IS NO MARKET FOR IT IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO TRY TO RECYCLE IT OVER AND OVER AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT CAN BE RATE RECYCLED MORE THAN ONCE. THE AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IT IS A DANGEROUS PRODUCT IT'S A DANGEROUS PRODUCT IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. IT BREAKS DOWN INTO MICROPLASTICS IT END UP EVEN WHEN IT'S AN LANDFILLS IN OUR WATER STREAMS THAT NOW IS DETECTABLE AT. PRETTY HIGH LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IN THIS ROOM AND EVEN IN THE BLOOD OF NEW BORN BABIES. THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND IN THIS CASE IT'S UNNECESSARY AS WE'VE SEEN IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY. WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THREE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA PLEASE STONE HI STONE I CHAO. CHU CHU I. DAVIES. DAVIES NO GONZALEZ.

THANK YOU RIGHT WILL NOW GO TO OUR ITEM NUMBER THREE AB NINE THIRTY SEVEN MS CARILLO. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY I'M HERE 2% AB NINE THREE SEVEN THE VISION ACT. WHICH WOULD PROTECT REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE FROM BEING FUNNELED INTO THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION. SYSTEM BY CALIFORNIA LOCAL JAILS AND PRISONS. THESE ARE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR TIME EARNED THEIR PAROLE AND HAVE HAD THEIR SENTENCES COMMUTED. BY GOV BY THE GOVERNOR AFTER A CLOSE REVIEW OF THE CLEMENCY APPLICATION. WHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ASSIST WITH TRANSFERS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO ICE. THE NORTHER RECORD OF REHABILITATION STABLE REENTRY PLAN. AND THEIR NETWORK COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SUPPORT. MANY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES SANTA CLARA SAN FRANCISCO HUMBLED SAN JOAQUIN SANTA CRUZ AND CONTRA COSTA. HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS. AND HAVE HALTED OR CUT BACK ON TRANSFERS TO IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS WHEN SOMEONE HAS SERVED THEIR TIME. MEMBERS IF NOT WERE FOR WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE BORN. THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. AB NINE THREE SEVEN WILL MOVE OUR STATE CLOSER TO FULFILLING ITS COMMITMENT. TO IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMS BLACKS LATINOS INDIGENOUS. AND AAPI COMMUNITIES IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT. AND A WILLINGNESS TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MASS INCARCERATION. HOWEVER FOR IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE EARNED THEIR RELEASE THIS JUST MEANS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HANDED OVER TO ICE AND FACE PERMANENT SEPARATION. FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. THE VISION ACT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO SET IMMIGRATION LAW. THIS BILL ONLY DOESN'T THIS BILL ALSO DOESN'T PRECLUDE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM PARTICIPATING IN JOINT TASK FORCES IF THE PURPOSE. OF THE TASK FORCE'S CRIMINAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. NOT INTEGRATION ENFORCEMENT. ON MARCH THIRTIETH. A WOMAN FROM OMANI NAME GABBY SOLANO WAS TRANSFERRED TO BY CDCR TO ICE. GABBY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF TWO AS A LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENT. GABBY IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOWEVER AND SPENT HALF HER LIFE BEHIND BARS FOR A CRIME COMMITTED. BY HER ABUSIVE EX PARTNER. AFTER SERVING TWENTY YEARS IN STATE PRISON GOVERNOR BROWN COMMUTED HER SENTENCE IN RECOGNITION OF HER DEMONSTRATED RECORD OF COMMITMENT. TO SERVICE MENTORSHIP AND REHABILITATION HOWEVER. RATHER THAN ALLOW GABBY TO RETURN HOME TO HER FAMILY INTO THE CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY CONTRACTED WITH ICE. PICTURE OF FROM A CDC OUR FACILITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND TRANSPORTED HER TO A DETENTION CENTER IN COLORADO WHERE SHE REMAINS TODAY. IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR SENTENCES OR OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR RELEASE. SHOULD NOT FACE A SECOND PUNISHMENT. WE SHOULD NOT FUNNEL THEM INTO A FEDERAL IMMIGRATION DETENTION AND DEPORTATION SYSTEM. DIVISION ACT WILL END IS TRANSFERS TO OR FROM OUR LOCAL JAILS NCDC ARE IN PRACTICE. A PRACTICE THE TREATS PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY JUST SIMPLY BASED ON WHERE THEY WERE BORN. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME.

FOR REST UNDERTAKEN BY OTHER AGENCIES SB NINE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD ELIMINATE THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO EITHER OF THOSE THINGS IF THE ACTION HAPPEN TO INCLUDE IN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE. FURTHER ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT THAT OFFENDERS PLACE OF BIRTH BE INCLUDED IN BASIC INFORMATION STORED IN STATE OR LOCAL CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORD INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR WILL NOW. CLOSE THE LINES THEN I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE FOR. QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR CHIU. THREE THANK YOU FOR. CHAIR. TENSION IT IS TRULY DOUBLE PUNISHMENT- BUT I'M GOING SPEAK TODAY AS AN ASIAN AMERICAN I KNOW THAT- IN SOCIETY THEIR STEREOTYPES THAT THE FOLKS WHO WOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THIS BILL. ARE MOSTLY FROM THE LATINO COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT TRUE I'M GONNA SPEAK AS THE- IMMEDIATE PAST CHAIR OF THE ACCOUNT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND SHARE. THE MANY STORIES I'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS- FROM SO MANY FAMILY MEMBERS OF REFUGEES FROM FROM OUR COMMUNITY BAND AND THEY BRING TO US- MANY VERSIONS OF THE SAME STORY SO THE STORY OF THE KID. WHO EMIGRATED AT THE AGE OF THREE FOUR FIVE. FLED PERSECUTION WAR BY FROM THEIR BIRTH COUNTRY- THEY THEMSELVES EXPERIENCED HORRIFIC VIOLENCE. THEY COME TO OUR COUNTRY HAVING EXPERIENCED INCREDIBLE TRAUMA. THEY HAVE SOME CHALLENGES ADJUSTING IN THEIR TEENAGE YEARS TO GET INTO SOME TROUBLE THEY RESTED THEY'RE CONVICTED AND THEY DO THEIR FULL TIME. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY COME OF THE FROM JUSTICE THERE PICKED UP FOR DEEP. EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THEIR ORIGINAL HOME COUNTRY HAVE NO TIES TO THEIR ORIGINAL BIRTH COUNTRY HAVE NO FAMILY. AND TO OUR COMMUNITY. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS THERE ARE PARENTS THEIR SPOUSES. THEY ARE MODEL CITIZENS ARE MODEL EXAMPLES PARTICULARLY TO AT RISK YOUTH FROM OUR COMMUNITY. AND HELP THEM FROM GETTING. FUTURE TROUBLE THESE ARE THE FOLKS. THAT WE NEED TO HELP AND JUST TO. PROVIDE SOME STATISTICS ON THIS- MANY OF THESE REFUGEES. ARE FROM OUR SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEE COMMUNITY WHO ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE DEPORTED. FOR PAST CONVICTIONS COMPARED TO OTHER IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SAID JUST AS AN EXAMPLE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ON SIXTEEN THOUSAND- SOUTHEAST ASIANS IN OUR COUNTRY RECEIVE FINAL DEPORTATION ORDERS MORE THAN THIRTEEN THOUSAND OF WHICH WERE BASED ON PAST CRIMINAL RECORDS. 80% OF DEPORTATION ORDERS FOR OUR SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES WERE LINKED TO OLD CRIMINAL RECORDS COMPARED TO TWENTY NINE PERCENT. OF ALL IMMIGRANTS WITH DEPORTATION ORDERS. AND DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN THE IN THE MIDDLE OF. THE TERM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. THERE WAS A TWO HUNDRED AND 79% SPIKE ANTI. OF CAMBODIAN REFUGEES. AND A OF VIETNAMESE REFUGEES. NOW I WISH WE COULD SAY THAT THE TARGETING OF OUR SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEE COMMUNITY. HAS STOPPED BUT IT HAS NOT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE. THE MIDDLE OF MARCH THE SAME WEEK AS THE HORRIFIC ATLANTA SHOOTING. AND DURING PRESIDENT BIDEN'S MORATORIUM ON DEPORTATION. WE HAD THIRTY THREE VIETNAMESE AMERICAN REFUGEE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE DEPORTED. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. AS WE FACE A VERY DISTURBING RISE IN ANTI ASIAN HATE. I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT WE MOVE FORWARD TO REALLY UPLIFT OUR COMMUNITIES AND I BELIEVE THE VISION ACT. HAS TO BE CENTRAL TO THAT SO WITH THAT I'M VERY HAPPY. TO SUPPORT IT REALLY DO- HOPE THAT OUR COLLEAGUES THINK ABOUT THE HUMAN IMPACT OF THIS AND THE WITHOUT HAVING A MOTION TO MOVE THIS FOR. THE YOU FOR YOUR MOTION A SERVICE. OUR O. SUCH THAT. OTHER QUESTIONS COMING. SIENET MISCREANT CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HAVE TOO MANY WINDOWS OPEN ON MY IPAD- I. PROPITIATE THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO FOR YOUR COMMENTS I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE OFTEN LANDS ON A LATINO LANDS AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL- IMMIGRANTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE IMPACTED BY LOSS THAT THE UNITED STATES HOUSE. I AM A FORMERLY UNDOCUMENTED CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY MY FAMILY ALSO FLED THE CIVIL WAR I HAVE MANY COUSINS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHO DID NOT HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND CHOICES- THAT I HAD AND SO THIS IS A VERY- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART AND CLOSE TO MY COMMUNITY. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE ULTIMATE QUESTION THAT WE ALMOST ASK OURSELVES IS DO YOU BELIEVE IN A JUST JUSTICE SYSTEM DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION IS ALSO DOING THEIR JOB IN THE REHABILITATION PORTION THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTS. ACROSS OUR STATE THAT ARE CAUGHT UP IN THE SYSTEM THAT SIMPLY IDENTIFIES THEM AS NON CITIZENS IMMIGRATION IS NOT SOLELY SYNONYMOUS WITH BEING UNDOCUMENTED THE CASE THAT I PRESENTED WAS OF A LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENT WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF TWO WHO IS NOW IN AN ICE FACILITY JUST BASED ON AFTER SPENDING TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON. BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF HER PERFORMER ABUSIVE PARTNER WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO ENSURE THAT- INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME THAT HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE RIGOROUS COURSE OF THE PAROLE BOARD HEARINGS THAT HAVE A DEMONSTRATED THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO COME BACK INTO SOCIETY TO BE WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO START A NEW. THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN THAT IS THE SIMPLE BASIS OF A JUST SOCIETY AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE TO ENSURE THAT THE VISION ACT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT EFFORT. AB EIGHT FOURTEEN WOULD PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY FROM ENGAGING IN CONTACT TRACING IN PLACE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ON DATA COLLECTED FOR CONTACT TRACING PURPOSES SPECIFICALLY THE BILL PROHIBITS DATA COLLECTED RECEIVE HER PREPARED FOR CONTACT THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU TRACING PURPOSES FROM BEING USED TO MAINTAIN OR DISCLOSE FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSES. IN FACILITATING CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS AS WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE PAST YEAR ONE OF THE STRATEGIES DEPLOYED TO LIMIT THE TRANSMISSION OF CODE NINETEEN IS THE USE OF CONTACT TRACING WHICH IDENTIFIES CODE NINETEEN POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE THEY MAY HAVE HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH. WHO ARE ADVISED TO SELF QUARANTINE LIMITING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS SUCCESSFUL CONTACT TRACING REQUIRES THE SHARING OF SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING A PERSON'S NAME ADDRESS PHONE NUMBER AND OTHER PERSONAL IDENTIFYING DATA. IN MAY OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LUNCH CONNECTED CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE COMPREHENSIVE CONTACT TRACING PROGRAM AND PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IN DECEMBER THE STATE LAUNCHED CALIFORNIA NOTIFIED AN APPLICATION THAT CALIFORNIA'S CAN DOWNLOAD ON THEIR PHONE THAT WILL NOTIFY USERS IF ANOTHER APPLICATION USER THEY'VE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR COKE IN NINETEEN. WELL THIS INFORMATION WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUCCESSFULLY STOP THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN AND FUTURE PANDEMICS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE OF POTENTIALLY BEING USED FOR NON HEALTH CARE RELATED PURPOSES INCLUDING MARKETING AND BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE LESS LIKELY TO WILLINGLY INTERACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE CONTACTS DUE TO DISTRUST AND FEAR. AND HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY COVE IN NINETEEN CONTACT TRACING IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE FUNCTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND UTILIZING LINE FOR SENT TO CONTACT TREE WILL. JUST AND TRACING EFFORTS AND HINDER. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS AB EIGHT FOURTEEN WILL PROTECT THE DATA PRIVACY OF CALIFORNIANS.

THIS BILL WOULD CREATE CORRECT A DRAFTING ERROR MADE IN SB FOUR SEVEN SEVEN BY THEN PRO TERM STEINBERG IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHICH CREATED THE FIRST FRAMEWORK OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION FOR TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS. AMONG ALL TYPES OF THE SAID THE H. TWO A. PROGRAM PIECE OF PROGRAM IS A TEMPORARY VISA CATEGORY LINK TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES IN THE UNITED STATES. AB THREE SIXTY FOUR WOULD ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS TO USE FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS. MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH MANDATES THAT ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE EXISTING LAWS. REGULATING FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS AND ONLY APPLY TO THEM. IF THE RECRUIT WORKERS FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IMPARTIAL CONTRACT FOR THE OWN H. TWO A. WORKERS WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS.

IT CRIMES DIFFICULT DISCOVER INTO. IF WORKERS DO RECORD WE NEED THE DISCOVERED THEY JUST WANT TO GO HOME. NOT STATE PROSECUTION. MOST TIMES THEY DON'T RECORD THE ABUSES BECAUSE WELL IF YOUR FAMILY DEPENDING ON THE MONEY SENT HOME EVEN IF IT'S NOT MUCH. EVEN IF YOU'RE A HORRIBLE WORKING CONDITIONS YOU'LL KEEP WORKING. WE'RE NOT GONNA PROFIT OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AND WE KNOW THAT IN A POST CODE WORLD WORKERS WILL BE EVEN MORE VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION AND FALSE PROMISES. YOU TO THE SITUATION THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. ADDRESSING ISSUES WITH RECRUITMENT AND THE WORKERS HOME COUNTRY REMOVED THOSE VULNERABILITIES. IT STOPPED IT BEFORE IT STARTS. STOP AT MY HOME COUNTRY DON'T ALLOW ME FOR SHOPPING ABSOLUTELY TREAT ALBIZIA CATEGORIES THE SAME. AND IF THERE IS A POLICE INVESTIGATION. BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE BAD ACTORS ARE THOSE THAT AREN'T REGISTERED FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS. WILL STREAMLINE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPEFULLY LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY. OF AN ASSISTANT FOR MORE VICTIMS. IT IS I'M- RECRUITERS. CREATE AN UNEVEN PLAYING FIELDS IN A LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES. WHO CAN'T COMPETE BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXPLOIT THE WORKERS.

THAT AB THREE SIXTY FOUR SEATS TO ADDRESS THAT WAS ORIGINAL INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN STEINBERG. IT JUST OVER THE AN ERROR THAT THERE WAS INTERPRETED. NOT INCLUDED BUT THAT WAS HIS ORIGINAL INTENT AS WELL. SAID THAT BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON OF NOT JUST TAKING WHAT WE HAVEN'T AND MAKING AMENDMENTS TO IT ADDING THAT INTO IT. WELL WE JUST FEEL THAT THIS IS THE BETTER WAY TO DO IT LEGISLATIVELY TO ADD. THE H. TWO EIGHT R. FOR. BECAUSE AGAIN A REGION INTENT OF BILL. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMON RIGHT SEEING NONE WITH REGARD TO MAKE CLOTHES I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU DO HAVE A MOST AND A AND IS PASS TO PRO CALDERON PLEASE STONE I STONE AYE CHAU CHIU DAVIES DAVIES NO SALAS AND I HOLD KALRA KILEY MAY.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF. TO PRESENT TODAY ON THE SAME BILL AND THIRTY AND THAT'S RELATING TO ENFORCEMENT OF AND I CAB BUSINESS. I WOULD LIKE BEGIN BY ALL F THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND THE AMOUNT. AND BY THINKING CAN STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR AND THE LINE. ACCORDING TO RECENT REPORTS ILLEGAL CANNABIS SELLERS AND CAL I WOULD NUMBER LEGAL REGULATED BUSINESSES BY NEARLY THREE TO ONE. THIS REPORT FOUND THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS GROWERS COLLECTIVELY PRODUCE ABOUT NINE MILLION POUNDS OF CANNABIS PER YEAR. THE DEMAND IN THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET CAN ONLY SUPPORT AROUND TWO MILLION POUNDS PER YEAR. THIS LEAVES ABOUT 80% OF THE CROP EITHER TO BE DESTROYED OR TO MAKE IT MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE ILLICIT MARKET. ESTIMATES PUT THE VALUE OF THE LOCAL CANNABIS MARKET AT AROUND EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. ALL OF THIS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS BOTH UNTAXED AND UNREGULATED. IN ADDITION TO DWINDLING TAX REVENUES THE UNDERGROUND MARKET PRESENTS SERIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. NEWS ARTICLES FROM AROUND THE STATE HAVE DOCUMENTED VIOLENCE. AND CRIME AT THESE UNLICENSED DISPENSARIES. IN ADDITION THE CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOLD AT THESE LOCATIONS DOES NOT MEET ESTABLISHED QUALITY STANDARDS AND EVADE STATE TESTING. AB ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD TARGET THE ILLICIT MARKET BY CREATING CIVIL PENALTIES. FOR INDIVIDUALS FOUND TO BE AIDING AND ABETTING THE SALE OF UNLICENSED CANNABIS. THE LANGUAGE. IN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FURTHER DEFINES AIDING AND ABETTING SO THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL CLEARLY DO NOT APPLY TO EMPLOYEES. AT ANY LEGAL SHOP. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO PREVENT THE FINES IN THE BILL FROM BEING USED AS LEVERAGE IN CRIMINAL CASES. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO PREVENT I'M SORRY THE BILL HAS ENJOYED THE SUPPORT OF LABOR.

PACKAGING OTHER PRODUCTS THEY'RE DERIVED FROM POST CONSUMER BALE PACKAGING- SPOKE BOTTLES AND THERMAL FORMS. BUT WE'RE RECYCLING UP WAKE FORM AND CONVERTING THE NEW BEVERAGE AND FOOD CONTAINERS ARE COMPLETELY PERFECTLY INTEGRATED FACILITY. LOCATED IN BURNING CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE ENTIRE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OCCURS UNDER SINGLE WHOOPS. THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS ARE AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD. CURRENTLY THE BEST ESTIMATES THERE ABOUT ONE THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS OF POST CONSUMER FILIFORM CONTAINERS ARE DISCARDED IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR. MOST OF WHICH ENDS UP IN A LANDFILL- WE DO SUPPORT THE REVISED LANGUAGE WITH REGARD TO THE CART RIGHT ACT APPLICATION OF AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT. THE ANTITRUST PROVISIONS SIMILAR TO OTHER RECYCLING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THOSE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS BATTERY SPRING. MATTRESSES AND CARPET. AS WRITTEN AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT PROVIDES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WE HAVE SEEN POSITIONS TAKEN BY SOME THAT WE BELIEVE ARE AT ODDS WITH THE INTENT OF AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT. APPLE PROPOSAL TO HAVE DIFFERENT MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENTS. BY READ THE TYPE. OF BIKE PLASTIC KITE MAY CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. FOR EXAMPLE. DOING SO MAY ENCOURAGE BRANDS AND RETAILERS TO SWITCH TO RETIN TYPES WITH A BALL WITH MINIMUM. YOUR CYCLE CONTACT THE CHOIR MATES. I THE IN OF A BEFORE SEVEN EIGHT. THE AMOUNT OF THE REFORMS AND THE LANDFILL AND MORNING THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATION. WE'VE ALSO HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN RESIN TYPES THAT ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE FDA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR DIRECT FOOD GRADE APPLICATIONS. IN ORDER TO USE RECYCLED MATERIALS. MORE DIRECTLY CONTACT APPLICATION THEY MUST BE STATE. WHICH IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED BY OBTAINING A LETTER OF NON OBJECTION. ALSO KNOWN AS THE L. AND HELD FROM THE USFDA. THAT IS BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE RECYCLING PROCESS AND THE QUALITY OF THE RESULTING MATERIALS. THIS IS ONE REASON THE ANTI TRUST PROVISIONS IS IMPORTANT SO THAT MANUFACTURERS CAN FACILITATE PURCHASING. OF RECYCLED THERMAL FORM- MATERIAL ENFORCER COLLECTION IN ORDER TO MEET THE RECYCLE CONTENT TARGETS IN ADDITION THE PACKAGING MANUFACTURERS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO SET BAIL QUALITY STANDARDS NEEDED TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS COOK FOOD GRADE FORMAL FORM CONTAINERS. IN ADDITION AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT WILL INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR FOOD STATE POST CONSUMER PLASTIC RESINS SUCH AS P. ET QUALITY PROGRAM AND POLYSTYRENE. BILL BY ENCOURAGING RECYCLERS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE FTA L. L. THAT THE NATION TO OBTAIN IT BECAUSE CUSTOMER DEMAND WILL EXIST TO JUSTIFY THE COLLECTION AND RECYCLING OF THESE WEAPON. TYPES TO APPROVE GREAT QUALITY. FURTHERMORE WE BELIEVE IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND AVAILABILITY APPROVED OF POST CONSUMER RESIDENTS WILL COME ABOUT MAYBE FOUR SEVEN EIGHT TO THE HIGHER RATE COLLECTION. RECYCLING AND DEMAND FOR THESE MATERIALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING LANDFILLS. I ASK YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. WITH WILSON GOOD MORNING CHAIR STONE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SCOTT WILKERSON AND I'M THE CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER AT BONDUELLE FRESH AMERICAS BASED IN IRWINDALE AND SALINAS CALIFORNIA YOU PROBABLY KNOW IT AS READY PAC FOODS WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST US COMPANIES FOR PRE PREPARED SALADS AND FRESH PRODUCE PRODUCTS. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO SET THE PACE FOR THE REST OF THE NATION AS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER AND EXPORTER. THERMOFORM PACKAGING SUCH AS CLAM SHELLS HAS TRULY REVOLUTIONIZED OUR ABILITY IN CALIFORNIA FOR ALL FARMERS TO TRANSPORT FRESH PRODUCE TO CONSUMERS NATIONWIDE. THIS PACKAGING ALSO HELPS TO PROTECT PROTECT THE PRODUCE FROM DAMAGING CONTAMINATION AND IT REDUCES FOOD WASTE. PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING MADE WITH POST CONSUMER RECYCLED CONTENT ARE INCREASINGLY A GLOBAL PRIORITY FOR THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER BRANDS AND RETAILERS OUR COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THEY HAVE A TO BE RECYCLABLE OR REUSABLE. OUR COMPANY HAS ALSO MADE FIRM COMMITMENTS TO THE USE OF RECYCLED P. E. T. THERMAL FOR. PREVIOUSLY MOST OF THE RECYCLED MATERIAL IS FROM PLASTIC BOTTLES WHICH IS INCREASINGLY IN HIGH DEMAND AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY THREE WHICH SETS MINIMUM CONTENT ON PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT AND EIGHTY FOUR SEVEN EIGHT BECAUSE THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE PACKAGING WE USE MEETS OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS THROUGH THE RECYCLED CONTENT MANDATE. THE BILL IS ALSO CRITICAL TO CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS INTO RECYCLABLE PRODUCT THAT ALSO HAS RECYCLED CONTENT AND THIS BILL WILL PROPEL THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN. FOR MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PACKAGING. THERE ARE SOME MANUFACTURERS THAT DO OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE RECYCLED CONTENT MANDATE HOWEVER MANY BRAND OWNERS HAVE SIGNED THE U. S. PLASTICS PACT WHICH IS MADE COMMITMENTS THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE AVERAGE RECYCLED CONTENT OR RESPONSIBLY SOURCED BIOBASED CONTENT IN PLASTIC PACKAGING WILL BE 30% IS THE DIRECTION THAT OUR COUNTRY IS MOVING. WE CAN ENSURE IT'S MAKING THIS MOVE BACK FROM CALIFORNIA. AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT WILL ENABLE THE THERMAL FARM INDUSTRY TO COORDINAE ON INVESTMENT.

ELEVEN NINETEEN. THANK YOU IS THERE A SECOND. SECOND THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND GREAT I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT QUICK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE STAFF FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT AUTHORS AMENDMENTS CLARIFYING THAT A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR AN EMPLOYEE WITH FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES. ONLY APPLIES WHEN THERE IS AN OBLIGATION ARISING FROM AN UNFORESEEN NEED TO CARE FOR MINOR CHILD OR CARE RECIPIENT. WHO SCHOOL OR PLACE OF CARE IS CLOSED UNEXPECTEDLY. AB ELEVEN NINETEEN WOULD PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES BASED ON THEIR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES. AS STATED PREVIOUSLY THIS BILL REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR KNOWN FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR UNEXPECTED SCHOOL OR CHILD CARE CLOSURES. THE AMERICAN FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION OCCURS WHEN AN EMPLOYER TAKES A NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT ACTION AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE. TO CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. THIS INCLUDES MOTHERS OR FATHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN PREGNANT OR BREAST FEEDING PEOPLE. AND EMPLOYEES WITH AGING PARENTS WERE SIX BOSSES ARE PARTNERS THAT MAY ENCOUNTER FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION. UNDER THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ROUGHLY 60% CHILDREN UNDER AGE EIGHTEEN HAVE BOTH PARENTS WORKING. MORE THAN ONE IN SIX AMERICANS WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME A REPORT ASSISTING THE CARE OF AN ELDERLY OR DISABLED FAMILY MEMBER RELATIVE. OR FRIEND AND OVER ONE AND TWELVE- EMPLOYED ADULTS ARE CARING FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND AN ELDERLY OR DISABLED INDIVIDUAL. MOST EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE CARE RESPONSIBILITIES AT SOME POINT IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL LIVES EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS LIKE TERMINATION REFUSAL TO HIRE DEMOTION OR BEING LOOKED OER FOR PROMOTIONS. MAYBE BASED ON BIASES ABOUT HOW WORKERS WITH FAMILY CARE RESPONSIBILITIES WILL OR SHOULD ACT WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR THE WORKERS ACTUAL PERFORMANCE. THIS TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION AFFECTS EMPLOYEES OF EVERY INCOME LEVEL RACE GENDER IN INDUSTRY. WORKING MOTHERS LOW WAGE WORKERS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. A STUDY FROM THE AMERICAN JOURNAL SOCIOLOGY FOUND THAT MOTHERS WERE 79% LESS LIKELY TO BE RECOMMENDED FOR HIRE. HALF AS LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED AND OFFERED IT AT AN AVERAGE OF ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS FOR THE SAME POSITION AS NON MOTHERS. MOST ALARMINGLY 80% OF NEARLY ONE POINT ONE MILLION WORKERS WHO DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE LESS AND LESS SEPTEMBER WERE WOMEN. ADDITIONALLY ALMOST TWO HUNDRED STATES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING ALASKA DELAWARE MINNESOTA NEW YORK. HAVE PROHIBITED FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION WITH LITTLE REPORTS OF ABUSE. EMPLOYEES ARE STRUGGLING TO BALANCE THEIR JOBS AND CARING FOR THEIR FAMILIES DISPARATE TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD NOT BE A REASON FOR TERMINATION. OR OTHER ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AS LIZ MORRIS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF HASTING CENTER FOR WORKLIFE LAW AND- JULIAN BURNS KINGS REPRESENTING- PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF OUR WITNESS ON THE FERRIES. THANK YOU I HAVE BOTH WITNESSES THIS MORRIS AND JULIAN BURNS KING LISTED AS BEING WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE ARE YOU. ARE YOU WITH US. WHAT ARE WE WILL TAKE HIS MORE CERTAIN MORNING JULIET. OKAY GO AHEAD PLEASE. THE MORNING THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR I'M BAD DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR WORKLIFE LAW. THANK YOU MANY WORKERS WITH FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN IN CRISIS OVER THE LAST YEAR WHEN THE SCHOOLS AND PROFESSIONAL CARE PROVIDERS BUT THEY RELY ON TO GET THE WORK HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE THE COMPANY. MOTHERS IN PARTICULAR HAV BEEN DEVASTATED. OFTENTIMES ARE ECONOMIC SECURITY AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH BUT THE HARSHEST IMPACT ON WOMEN OF COLOR SINGLE MOTHERS AND WORKERS IN LOW PAYING JOBS. NOT ONLY HAVE THEY THOUGHT THAT THEIR CHILDREN DR JIM. ANYWAY HOW MUCH SNOW BONTA LEARNING FOOD INSECURITY AND OTHER LIKE PROPERTY. DURING THE PANDEMIC WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO CARING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THE ELDERLY AND FAMILY MEMBERS THE ABILITY HAPPY HEART WRENCHING CHOICE. BETWEEN PROVIDING ADEQUATE CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES KEEPING THE PAINT SHOP IN A FIVE. BUT THESE CHOICES ARE NOT NEW DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FAMILY CAREGIVERS EXISTED LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE TO TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THAT. I CALIFORNIA IS BEHIND IN ADDRESSING THAT NEARLY 40% OF THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE ALREADY PROTECTED BY STATE OR LOCAL LAWS THAT PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES ARE GETTING POSSIBILITIES. CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE LEFT OUT. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE OTHER STATE SHOWS AND WE RESPONSIBILITIES DISCRIMINATION MOB WORK FOR EMPLOYEES AND BUSINESSES ALIKE ARE ENCOURAGING EMPLOYERS TO TREAT THEM ATTACK EVER STAY ON THEIR JOB PERFORMANCE. THAT A FIVE ONE WHICH HAS THE POWER TO BOTH THE JOB AND AVOID BOXES. AB ELEVEN NINETEEN IS IMPERATIVE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC RECOVERY IT WILL ENSURE FAMILY CAREGIVERS TYPICALLY WOMEN ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE LAKE PARK. OAKLAND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY IT'S NOT A PRIVATE POLITICS IF THE HARD AND NECESSARY WORK OF CARING FOR THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND RAISING THE NEXT GENERATION OF WORKERS BUT WE'LL KEEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING.

THE ACTUALLY HOFFMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. MORNING MR KAREN MEMBERS THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO- AB ONE ONE ONE NINE AS A JOB KILLER I DO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE IN THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT SOME CLARIFICATION AS TO WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS WITH RESPECT TO THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENTS. WE DO HOWEVER STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL BUT IT'S UNCLEAR HERE IS WHAT GAP IS STILL TRYING TO SELL LABOR COULD YOU THIRTY POINT EIGHT ALREADY PROVIDES FORTY HOURS OF LEAVE PER SCENARIOS WHERE THERE'S AN UNFORESEEN CLOSURE OF A SCHOOL OR CHILD CARE CENTER. HE LEADS STATUTES CAN CARE AND SEE FOR ALREADY PROVIDE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR OTHER CARE RECIPIENTS UP TO TWELVE WEEKS RATHER THAN WORK WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THESE CARE ACT LEADS ALREADY EXISTS THIS BILL CREATES A VEGAN UNCAPPED REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS TO BE ANOTHER COMMON EIGHTEEN THIRD SHUTTING DOWN SCHOOL FOR A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS EMPLOYERS WOULD HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL EMPLOYEES FOR PARENTS THAT ENTIRE TIME. IT ALSO ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATES THE TWELVE WEEK CAP ON FIFA NOW BY THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO JUST FIVE EMPLOYEES BY KNOCKING THIS BILL WE ARE PUTTING YET ANOTHER VAGUE MANDATE ON EMPLOYERS WANTED THAT IS FREQUENTLY THE SOURCE OF LITIGATION DURING THE LAST HEARING ON THE SPELLING STATED THAT LITIGATION UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACTIVE SO WHERE IS BEING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. THAN ACTUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING AN APPOINTMENT CHARGE FILED AGAINST YOU IS TEN POINT 5% IN CALIFORNIA THAT RATE IS 56% THAT'S NOT EVEN INCLUDING MAN LETTERS THREATENING LITIGATION PRIOR TO THE F. EACH TARGETING CROWD WHICH IS HOW SOME LOCKERS EXCLUSIVELY MAKE THEIR MONEY. NO OTHER STATE THAT INCLUDES PERRIN HEAD OR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES IS IN IN ITS ANTI DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS INCLUDE A REASONABLE COMPETITION REQUIREMENTS IN FACT DELAWARE WHICH HAS THE MOST BROAD DEFINITION OF FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES SIMILAR TO WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE EXPLICITLY STATES THAT THERE IS NO ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENTS AND THAT THE ANTI DISCRIMINATION PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY. WITH RESPECT TO THE EMPLOYERS ATTENDANCE AND ABSENTEEISM STANDARDS FINALLY EVEN PUTTING A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROVISION ASIDE. THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES IS PROBABLY. UNDER THE SPELL. AND A VERY BOLD LINE BETWEEN NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST SOMEONE BASED ON THE NEED TO CARE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. AND WE'RE- A COMEDY. THERE'S ACTUALLY READ CAL COURT. IN WHICH THE CAT COURT NINE. JUDGMENT FOR AN EMPLOYER UNDER. CLAIM BECAUSE THE SUPERVISOR DID NOT HONOR THE EMPLOY SCHEDULE REQUEST TO HAVE AN EARLIER SHIFT TO BE HOME ON CERTAIN DAYS TO PROVIDE CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. THE COURT CREATED THE DE FACTO COMBINATION REQUIREMENT EVEN AFTER DIRECTLY STATING THAT THERE WAS NO REASONABLE COMBINATION REQUIREMENT FOR THAT SCENARIO UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION OF FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THIS PROVISION IS SURE TO GENERATE SOME MORE CASES WHERE EMPLOYERS ARE IN ESSENCE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION. IF THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TRULY TO ENSURE THE APPLICANTS ARE NOT BEING TURNED AWAY BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS. ARE WORKERS ARE BEING DENIED PROMOTIONS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN L. RELATIVE TO CARE FOR THIS BILL REACHES FAR BEYOND THAT AND IF I COULD DO. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE FINANCIALLY DEVASTATED TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THAT IS ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY SUFFERING DUE TO COLD IT. FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE AB. ELEVEN NINETEEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELL NOW GO TO OTHERS WHO LIKE TO INTO OFFICE. TO BE A LOT NINETY.

THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN THE OPPOSITION Q. I THANK YOU I WILL THEN BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES OPERATOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. AS DAVID THANK YOU THANK YOU MISLED- AS STATED ALREADY THAT THE ON THE LABOR CODE DOES PROVIDE UP TO FORTY HOURS LEAVE- FORWARD THAT DAYCARE SCHOOLS AT AN EXPECTED A CLOSE AS WELL AS THERE USED TO A PICK UP. STUDENTS FROM SCHOOL IF NEED BE- I ALSO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY- RIGHT ACT AND THAT PROVIDES UP TO THREE MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE FOR MEDICAL CARE WHICH IS FANTASTIC IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE ALWAYS NEEDED. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER THE POTENTIAL OF- LITIGATION BEING PUT ON A SMALL BUSINESSES THERE'S BAD ACTORS AND THERE'S GOOD ACTORS- BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOY THESE PEOPLE AND SO IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO BE THERE ARE. THE JOBS LEAVE SO WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT ON THE LITIGATION THAT COULD COME UP THERE SPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE- A REASONABLE- YOU KNOW REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF THAT THAT'S MY CHILDREN. THANK YOU THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION FOR **** SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE FORTY HOURS A WEEK OF- DOES NOT APPLY TO BUSINESSES TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR OR BELOW SO I THINK WE'RE LEAVING OUT A WHOLE COHORT OF FOLKS THERE- WITH REGARD TO THE LYTIC LITIGATION- QUESTION. WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN THIS BILL THAT'S BEEN PASSED IN OVER TWO HUNDRED MINUTES OF HOLIDAYS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HASTINGS LAW DID SOME RESEARCH ON THIS AND- AND FOUND I THINK IN TOTAL THERE WERE SEVENTY ONE TOTAL LAWSUITS PERTAINING TO THIS SO. IT'S JUST NOT. AS PREVALENT I THINK IS THE CHAMBERS SAYING THAT IT WILL BE- I ALSO THINK THAT THIS BILL IS IT'S VERY NARROWLY DEFINED YOU KNOW IT'S- REQUIRES REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE KNOWN FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES AN APPLICANT OR EMPLOYEE RELATED TO OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM. NEEDING TO CARE FOR A MINOR CHILD OR CARE RECIPIENT WHO SCHOOL OR PLACE OF CARE IS CLOSED OR OTHERWISE UNAVAILABLE SO IT'S NARROW IN SCOPE- AND THE LAST THING I'LL SAY WITH THE FORTY HOURS YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE USED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. STALKING I MEAN THERE'S A WIDE AGE OF THINGS AS A SHOULD BE. THIS IS VERY NARROW AND- THE STRANGER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I REALLY I THINK I UNDERSTAND PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANYONE THERE ARE BETTER THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE- SITTING UP HERE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS I'VE BEEN A SINGLE DAD NOW FOR- FOURTEEN YEARS IN EFFECT AS THIS WAS GOING ON MY DAUGHTER AND I'VE BEEN TEXTING ABOUT A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT THAT WE NEED TO. COMPLETE AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT- AND NUMBER THE SITUATIONS AND THEN SOME THAT WERE BROUGHT UP HERE HAVE I'VE PERSONALLY EXPERIENED HOW HARD THIS IS TO DO- SO. I APPRECIATE THIS AND I AND I REALLY SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THIS ONE OF THE THINGS I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOUGH IS. A I DO THINK THAT THE- THERE NEEDS TO BE CERTAINTY. AND THE DEFINITIONS NEED TO BE TIGHTLY DEFINED FOR AN FOR. A NUMBER OF REASONS. WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW FAIRNESS TO SMALL BUSINESSES- BUT- BUT IN ADDITION IT'S AVOIDING LITIGATION YOU KNOW. FOR THE ACTORS OUT THERE AND I AM REALLY I DO. THINK YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE TRY TO ACCOMPLISH UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HAVE A- LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING FOR SINGLE PARENTS IN PARTICULAR HOW HARD IT IS- AND EVEN IF THEY'RE- IN A TWO PARENT. YOU KNOW SITUATION THEY THEY- THEY CAN REALLY FIGURE OUT THAT WITH ONE OF YOU IT'S HARD. SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY TRYING TO COMPLY AND TRYING TO DO RIGHT. UNDERSTAND WHAT HOW WHAT THE LEGAL DEFINITION YEP NOT A COMMONSENSE DEFINITION OF REASONABLE. BUT A LEGAL DEFINITION OF REASONABLE AND THAT'S HARD TO DO SO COULD YOU GO THROUGH AGAINYOU SAID THIS IS. SO COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW QUOTE QUOTE REASONABLE AND QUOTE YEP. AND THEN ALSO TALK ABOUT THE SCOPES OF THE SURE THINGS. YES SO- IT REQUIRES COME. AND WHICH COULD BE WORK FROM HOME YOU KNOW WHICH WAS SORT OF THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS- THE LAWYER WHO WAS READING THE STATEMENT RIGHT- OTHER PEOPLE ARE WORKING FROM HOME CAN SHE WORK FROM HOME SHE HAS TO DO SOMETHING WITH HER CHILD YOU KNOW- IS IT CAN I. YOU KNOW MY KIDS IN THE SUCH SEVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD HAVE BOMB THREATS AT MY SCHOOL. YOU KNOW AND MY MOM HAVE TO COME PICK ME UP AND IT WOULD BE AN HOUR OUT OF HER DAY WERE SHE NEED TO GO DO THAT. SHE WANT TO TAKE A WHOLE DAY OFF OF WORK IN ORDER TO DO THAT BUT WANTED TO USE SOME OF THAT TIME. RIGHT AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES SORT OF A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. FOR KNOWN FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES SO THESE ARE KNOWN RESPONSIBILITIES OF AN APPLICANT OR EMPLOYEE RELATED TO OBLIGATION. ARISING FROM NEEDED TO CARE FOR A MINOR CHILD OR CARE RECIPIENT SO COULD BE AN OLDER PARENT. OR A DISABLED PERSON IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU YOU CARE FOR ARE NOT THE PRIMARY CARE GIVER- SCHOOL OR PLACE OF CARE IS CLOSED OR OTHERWISE UNAVAILABLE. SO THAT IS THE NARROW FOCUS OF THE BILL- IN ADDITION TO THAT- IF THERE IS UNDUE HARDSHIP TO THE- EMPLOYER- WHICH IS DEFINED AS SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY OR EXPENSE. SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WORK AT A SEVEN ELEVEN YOU'RE THE ONLY EMPLOYEE THERE. AND SOMETHING HAPPENS THEY HAVE TO SHUT THE SHOP DOWN IF THEY CAN'T FIND SOMEONE TO COME IN. THAT WOULD BE UNDUE HARDSHIP- WHICH WOULD NOT THEN QUALIFY FOR THIS AND I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK MOST EMPLOYERS. YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO BE ACCOMMODATING TO THEIR TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND I THINK MOST EMPLOYEES WANT TO DO A GOOD JOB AT THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT- BUT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT I MENTIONED IN MY- INITIAL STATEMENTS. DO WILL POINT TO THE FACT THAT WE DO NEED I THINK TO WRAP HER ARMS A LITTLE BIT MORE AROUND THIS AND I'M VERY MINDFUL OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW AND DISCOVERED RECOVERY ERA YOU KNOW AND I'VE SAT DOWN AND HAD NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAMBER. I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS WELL AS A SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. YOU KNOW VERY COUNCIL IN OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS AS WELL AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS BUSINESSES I TALK TO. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCESAND I AGREE I THINK THAT DEFINITIONS ARE IMPORTANT AND- SOME MEMBERS ALSO I CHATTED ABOUT THIS- IN THE ALASKAN. AND I AND WE WERE ON SOMEONE- AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO BECAUSE I DO WANT TO CREATE A THOUGHTFUL BILL. AND ON ON SCOPES WOULD SCOPE INCLUDE AS HARDSHIP FOR EXAMPLES. IT IN A CERTAIN PROFESSIONS ENOUGH OR MAYBE A LAWYER ACCOUNTANT BE EASIER TO WORK FROM HOME FRIDAY. SEPT THE SEVEN ELEVEN. SHOP MORE DISCOURSE. WHAT ABOUT SOME ARE SORT OF IN THEM WHAT IF YOU WERE A- MECHANIC LET'S SAY INTEREST. IS THERE AND THERE WERE. SEVEN EMPLOYEES GOING DOWN TO SIX OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT. RIGHT WHAT DO YOU DO SO FOR THAT WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF. SO I MEAN I THINK IF IT'S A MECHANIC WHO HAS TO PHYSICALLY BE THERE. RIGHT AND THAT'S A JOB THAT REQUIRES A PERSON TO PHYSICALLY BE THERE. SO THAT PERSON OBVIOUSLY CAN'T WORK FROM HOME RIGHT. BUT IF THERE'S A WAY THAT. YOU KNOW IN A MOMENT WHERE THEY NEED TWO OR THREE HOURS TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING. YOU KNOW CAN THEY CALL SOMEONE WHO'S OFFERED TO COMMAND. CAN SOMEONE COVER THEIR SHIFT. CAN THEY PROVIDE SOME KIND OF A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS OF THE PERSON CAN DEAL. WITH THAT THE SINCE THE SITUATION AT HAND. OKAY I. AM THEN I. WILL YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA CAN. TO WORK ON SO OF COURSE YEAH AND I'M A YOU KNOW AND I'VE TALKED TO THE CHAMBER- WE HAVEN'T REACHED AN AGREEMENT. I WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE CHAMBERS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO TALK TO ME- THEY MIGHT GET SICK OF ME BUT I'M HAPPY TO KEEP CHATTING AND- AGAIN WITH OTHER BUSINESSES AS WELL TO SEE IF WE CAN- DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY. WELL I YOU KNOW I'M I'M GONNA SAY INDEFINITE FOR THE SITE. TODAY WE URGE YOU TO KEEP WORKING ON THE LEGAL DEFINITION I DON'T WANT TO GET LOST IN LITIGATE HAVE TO HAVE THIS BE. JUST BE A TON OF NEEDLESS. LITIGATION AGAIN HIS IS SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW I WISH. I COULD HAVE UTILIZED OVER THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS YEAH- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. QUALITY CREDIBLY REWARDING EXPERIENCE FOR ME IT IS DEFINITELY BAD AND- YOU KNOW VERY DIFFICULT VERY STRESSFUL- AND IT'S HARD. IT'S HARD FOR FAMILY YOU KNOW FOR SINGLE PARENTS- YOU KNOW WITH KIDS. TO MANAGE THE EIGHT MILLION THINGS THAT COME UP BETWEEN SCHOOL AND- SPORTS OF DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS OR SOMEBODY GETTING SICK OR- THINGS AT SCHOOL IT'S JUST A- IT'S JUST A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE WITH ONE PERSON TRYING TO. IT'S A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE WITH TWO PARENTS. AND ONE IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND I'VE HAD SIMILAR SITUATIONS WHICH I MENTIONED IN MY LAST COMMITTEE. THAT DAY I HAD A PROBLEM RIGHT- AND WE'RE LUCKY WE'RE PRIVILEGE RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T WHO DON'T HAVE THE SAME PRIVILEGE THAT WE DO- SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS THE RIGHT WAY BUT I DO HEAR THE CONCERNS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND I ALSO WELCOME FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMITTEE OR OTHERS WHO. WANT TO KEEP HELPING ME WORK ON THE BILL. WOULD JUST LOVE TO STICK IT OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. THANK YOU. THIS TO JEFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- YES I DO- THANK GOD DOES SOMEBODY DEFINITIONS COULD BE FINE TUNE A LITTLE BIT MORE ARE I HAVE A LOT OF US SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL DOESN'T NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEM OUT AS MUCH HAVE SO I'M HOPING THAT UP ANYTIME THE BILL REACHES THE FLOOR I'LL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT AGAIN OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MR TRUMP. THIS COMES OUT I THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS IT'S DEFINITELY IN BETTER SHAPE I THINK AND THEN WHEN WE SIGN LABOR- I GUESS I JUST KEEP COMING BACK TO THINKING ABOUT COST. ACCOMMODATION AND WHAT THAT COULD MEAN. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ON NOW. AND I DON'T MEAN TO DO THIS TO VERY VERY HONEST I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED. THAT IT DOES THE ACCOMMODATIONS AVAILABLE TO. WHITE COLLAR WORKERS- IS MUCH BROADER THAN I MEAN YOU'RE EXAMPLES ITSELF SHOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY NEED THIS THE MOST ARE LEAST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT. SO I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS A WAIT THE APPROACH TO GO OR NOT BUT- I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IN SOME OF THE THINGS ARE GETTING CONFUSED AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMIND PEOPLE YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN TAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY- IF YOUR CHILD IS SICK WE BROKE THOSE PROTECTIONS THIS BODY DID IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN I THINK I'M SO SICK LEAVE YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE DOES MATTER HOW SMALL. THE EMPLOYER IS WHICH IS GOOD IT'S FAIR IT'S- IMPORTANT- AND I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE THAT RIGHT RIGHT NOW- IF THEY HAVE ACCRUED SICK LEAVE. IT'S PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH ACCRUED SICK LEAVE WHERE BILL FOR THAT. BUT I'M WONDERING IF THIS THE UTILIZATION OF ALREADY- PAID TIME OFF. TO BE EXPANDED FOR THIS PURPOSE MIGHT BETTER FIT IN THAT STATUTE. I THINK YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO. PUT SOMETHING IN A DIFFERENT STATUTE THAT MAYBE I I'M STILL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH JUST A THOUGHT. THAT IT MIGHT BE THAT WE JUST. COULD EXPAND THE UTILIZATION OF PAID TIME OFF THAT WE ARE SURE I MEAN AND I'M HAPPY TO DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE I THINK. I'M NOT. MARRIED TO THIS IDEA THAT HAS TO BE THIS WAY BUT WHAT I AM FOCUSED ON IS PROVIDING THE ACCOMMODATION RIGHT SUPER IMPORTANT SO I'M HAPPY TO TOTAL TO LOOK INTO THAT- YOU KNOW MILWAUKEE ELSE WAS THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION- AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOME LESSONS LEARNED FROM THEM AS WELL- SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION AND THIS IS DEFINITELY. LIKE A NEWER CONCEPT BUT IT ONE THAT'S BEEN TRIED IN OTHER PLACES SO WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT HERE BUT- I'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IS IT TOO BROAD BUT IT ALSO ISN'T SO NARROW THAT IT EXCLUDES. INDIVIDUALS WHO DO SERVICE WORK BASICALLY RIGHT NOW I HEAR YOU OKAY THANK YOU. RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SIGNALED THIS WEEK TO MAKE CLOTHES JUST RESPECT RESPECTFULLYASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IS I STILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO AND WANT TO KEEP THE PLOT MOVING FORWARD.

I NAY BEFORE TWENTY FOUR AB FOUR TWENTY FOURTHS TRYING IS ANOTHER STUDENT LOAN BILL TO TRY TO DEAL WITH A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND THIS IS. WHERE SERVICERS AND COLLECTION AGENCIES ARE UTILIZING THE COURT SYSTEM AND TAKING ADVANTAGE. OF INDIVIDUALS THE THOSE THE STUDENT BORROWERS WHO ARE NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED AND DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM. SO THEY WILL GO TO COURT THE SERVICERS AND THE- THE COLLECTION AGENCIES WILL WILL GO TO COURT TO SEEK A. A DECLARATORY RELIEF ON AGAINST THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THAT INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW ENOUGH TO GO TO COURT TO RESPOND IT INTO ADEQUATELY PROTECT THEMSELVES AND ONCE THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS ENTERED INTO. THANK WESTON'S ABOUT EVIDENCE DON'T ARRIVE. AND THEY WILL OFTEN THESE SERVICERS AND THE COLLECTION AGENCIES WALKING GOING WITHOUT CLEARLY BEING EVEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT THEY OWN THE DEBT THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT. TO SEEK THE DEATH. AND SOMEONE WHO PUT IS WILLING AND UNDERSTANDS HOW TO PUSH BACK IN THAT EVIDENCE REPROCESS WILL DO SO AND WOULD POTENTIALLY WIN AND THIS IS WHAT THE DATA SHOWS IS SO MANY TIMES THE SERVICERS AND THESE COLLECTION AGENCIES REALLY CAN'T EVEN DEMONSTRATE. THAT THEY OWN THE DEBT BUT ONCE A DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS ENTERED INTO THEN THAT BORROWER IS SEVERELY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND REALLY DOESN'T HAVE RECOURSE ALL THIS BILL DOES IT'S AN EVIDENCE BILL. IS ASKS THAT IN THESE CASES THAT THE- STUDENT SERVICER OR THE DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY DEMONSTRATE AFFIRMATIVELY THAT THE ON THE DEBT THAT THEY CAN IDENTIFY. THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWER.

ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE STUDENT BAR PROTECTION CENTER- WE'RE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT COMMITTED TO ENDING STUDENT DEBT CRISIS IN HERE TODAY BECAUSE OUR ORGANIZATION- PRACTICE SPONSOR AND SUPPORT EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR. EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR STILL HOLDS AN IMPORTANT GAP THE REMAINS IN CALIFORNIA CONSERVE LAW- THE. SPEED OF PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS IN DEFAULT- I THIS COMMITTEES WHERE'D COLLECTOR AND DEBT COLLECTION LAWSUITS WERE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF MR STONE PLAN MARKSTON BARBEL. AND IS TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ONE SERVICING ACT. AS A RESULT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS WHO OWE. MORE THAN TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN LOANS REMAIN VULNERABLE TO AN ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING ARRANGE THE PIECES. IF THEY BALK FALL BEHIND ON THE DEATH. BEFORE I CO FOUNDED THE BAR PROTECTION EXPENSE SEVEN THAT. AT THE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. WHICH BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THE BIGGEST ABUSER OF CALIFORNIA COURTS THE NATIONAL COLLEGIATE STUDENT LOAN TRUSTS. NCLT ALONG WITH BEING OUT OF STATE NONBANK CREDITORS LIKE NAPPIES. HAVE PILED THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN CALIFORNIA COURTS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. IN THE CFPB'S LANDMARK LAWSUIT AGAINST NCLT THE BUREAU FOUND- THE EMPTY THOUGHT HE FILED FALSE AFFIDAVITS IN STATE COURT IN LACKS DOCUMENTS TO BACK UP. DEBTS IN THOUSANDS OF CASES. RECENT RESEARCH BY A PARTNERS AT C. IRVINE CONSUMER LAW CLINIC SHOWS THAT ACTIONS IN ACTIONS BROUGHT BY AND PFLP IN ITS PEERS IN FULLY 90% OF CASES. FARMERS LACK LEGAL COUNSEL. THESE TWO WISHES IN COMBINATION THE LACK OF LEGAL COUNSEL AND THE ABUSE OF CALIFORNIA COURT AGREED UNMITIGATED DISASTER FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE BORROWERS TOO MANY OF HIM DISCOVER AFTER THE FACT THAT THEIR WAGES WERE GARNISHED FOR DEBT THAT WERE UNDOCUMENTED. OR INVALID. I THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS AND CREDIT UNIONS ARE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION I WANT TO CONCLUDE BY EMPHASIZING THAT THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF THESE ABUSES ARE NOT CALIFORNIA BANKS. AND THEY'RE NOT CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNIONS. NPSL HE'S NOT BACK AT ALL WITH A LOAN STUFF INTO THESE TRAPS WERE MADE BY THE BIGGEST BANKS IN THE WORLD JPMORGAN CHASE BANK OF AMERICA AND U. S. BANK. BANK MADE SUBPRIME STUDENT LOANS WERE PASSED UP TO INVESTORS BORROWER STRUGGLE TO REPAIR A AND DECADES LATER THESE CASES CONTINUE TO CALL CALIFORNIA COURTS AND HER CALIFORNIA BARS. BIG BANKS AREN'T FILING THESE LAWSUITS BUT THE LAWSUITS ARE A LEGACY OF PREDATORY LENDING BY BEING OUT. OF STATE AND NATIONAL BANKS. FORTUNATELY A FORTY FOUR ONE THE FIFTY TO THIS CHIU MR. GRAD MISTER SUPPORT THIS BILL AND URGING I. ON EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR CALIFORNIA STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT LONGER. THANK YOU MR PIERCE ROBIN SMITH- THE PHONE LINE. YES I'M HERE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ROBIN SMITH I AM A SENIOR ATTORNEY AT THE LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES I HAVE BEEN REPRESENTING BORROWERS AND PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN COLLECTION ACTION SIX TWENTY THIRTEEN DURING THE TIME I HAVE HANDLED MULTIPLE CASES INVOLVING MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLAINTIFFS INCLUDING SECURITIZED LOAN TRUST LIKE THE NATIONAL COLLEGIATE AND NAVEEN STUDENT LOAN TRACKER. THAT FIRED AND INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT GUARANTEE PAYMENTS ON DEFAULTED LOANS A COLLECTION OF PIECES WE HAVE SEEN ARE COMMON AMONG ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLANS THAT LAPTOP YOU WILL SUPPORT EIGHTY TWENTY FOUR FOUR TWENTY FOUR WHICH WILL PREVENT PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN HOLDERS FROM ABUSING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BY FILING DEBT COLLECTION LAWSUITS WHEN THEY LACK THE MOST BASIC EVIDENCE NECESSARY TO MAKE A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR BREACH OF WRITTEN CONTRACT. I WILL SHARE CHIU BRIEF STORY ILLUSTRATES THE HARM THAT WOULD BE PREVENTED BY EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR AND I CHANGED THE NAME FOR THEIR CONFIDENTIALITY WITH ALL RESIDENTS THINK OF MOTHERS ACCORDING TO THE CHILDREN BUT A LOW WAGE JOB IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A DEFAULT JUDGMENT AT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS ENTERED AGAINST HER FOR PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN SHE OBTAINED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. EVEN THOUGH THE PLAINTIFFS LACK OF THE EVIDENCE THAT IT OWNED AND HAD A RIGHT TO COLLECT ON THE LOT MS OPERATES CONTACTED OUR OFFICE FOR HELP BECAUSE HER EMPLOYER HAD BEEN GARNISHING OVER TWO YEARS AND AS A RESULT SHE WAS STRUGGLING TO PAY HER RENT AND OTHER BASIC LIVING EXPENSES. WE DISCOVERED THAT HER EMPLOYER HAD APPLIED THE INCORRECT GARNISHMENT FORMULA AND A LEGALLY GARNISHED OVER NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHY WE WERE ABLE TO GET THIS AMOUNT REFUNDED IN TOP OVER GARNISHMENT. ALVAREZ'S WAGES MAY STILL BE GARNISHED BECAUSE OUR PAYMENTS ARE NOT LIKELY TO COVER THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE AND THEN THE CREWS THAT WILL GROW EVEN AFTER WAGES ARE GARNISHED SHE CANNOT DISCHARGE THE DEBT THROUGH THE STATE OF BANKRUPTCY EITHER SHE BASICALLY HAD NO OPTION. TO PREVENT THE GARNISHMENT IN THE FUTURE. IN ANOTHER CASE INTO THAT SIX IS BEING UPDATES TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PRICE STUDENT. WITH A- PERCENT ANNUAL PER. RATE FROM A BANK TO. HOW WHICH WERE CO SIGNED BY HER MY- IS BEING ENTER MY ARE LOW INCOME AT. AMERICAN WOMEN WHO HAVE NEVER MADE ANY PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN AND THEY COULD NOT AFFORD THEM AND NO AFFORDABLE PAYMENT OPTIONS ARE OFFERED. TWELVE YEARS LATER BOTH MEN BAILEY AND HER MOTHER WERE SERVED WITH A COMPLAINT. FILED BY A PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN TRANCHE. THINKING DAMAGES THE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT. WE REPRESENTED BOTH OF THEM AND ASSERTED VERY DEFENSIVE INCLUDING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS AND THE PLAINTIFFS LACK OF STANDING DUE TO ITS INABILITY TO PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN A FIND THE INDIVIDUAL UP. AFTER WE SERVE EXPENSIVE DISCOVERY UNNOTICED THE DEPOSITION. OF PLAINTIFF DISMISSED A LOT THEY- AND THE- DAMAGE EIGHT TWENTY IT'S CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THAT LOW INCOME BORROWERS MOST OF WHOM ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION. DO NOT FACE A LIFETIME OF WAGE GARNISHMENT TO TAKE TO PAY OFF DEFAULT JUDGMENTS FOR DEBT THEY DO NOT LEGALLY OUT. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR VOTE FOR EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU.
