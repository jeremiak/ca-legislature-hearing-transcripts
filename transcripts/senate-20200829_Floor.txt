THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY EXTENDS THE SUNSET FOR JUST ANOTHER FIVE YEARS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX- MORE TWO HUNDRED STUDIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT APPROVING SYRINGE. ACCESS REDUCES THE RATE A SYRINGE SHARING AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION WITHOUT INCREASING THE RATE OF DRUG USE DRUG INJECTION OR CRIME THIS STUDY HAS FOUND OTHERWISE IN FACT RESEARCH BY OUR CALIFORNIA FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IS INCLUDED NO EVIDENCE OF INCREASED DRUG USE OR CRIME IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATED WITH THE AUTHORIZED. USE OF SYRINGES WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS- THIS THE SITUATION'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A WHILE AT ACTUALLY IN. THE STATE- AND SO JUST EXTENDING THIS ANOTHER FIVE YEARS IS GOING TO HELP CONTINUE TO BE SURE WE PREVENT THE SPREAD OF HIV AND HEPATITIS C. STRONGLY SUPPORTED- BY PUBLIC HEALTH EVIDENCE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR KNIGHTHOODS THANK YOU SENATOR PAN MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR. DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING IN HERE NONE. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY AND I SEE SENATOR GROVES HAND UP SENATOR GROVE. HE CAME OUT OF PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION IN THIS BILL I MEAN TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO HAVE- SYRINGES OR HYPODERMIC NEEDLES. AND A NEEDLE TO HAVE THEM FREELY WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION IT'S JUST NOT GOOD COMMON SENSE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE- HELP PEOPLE GET OFF OF THAT ADDICTIONS THAT THEY HAVE SO THAT THEY CAN LEAVE. LIVE VIBRANT AND FULL LIVES- I DO DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT SAYS THAT THERE IS STATISTICAL DATA OUT THERE THAT SAYS. THAT NO PROVIDING THESE HYBRID DURING NEEDLES ARE THESE NEEDLES I REDUCES CRIME- I DO TO AYE.

AND THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY GOING TO INTERACT WITH A CLEAN NEEDLE OR INTERACT WITH A USED NEEDLE WHERE THEY CAN GET HIV HEPATITIS OR ANY OTHER MATTER. OF INFECTION THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BERATE THEM AND JUST TELL THEM TO STOP INJECTING WE HAVE TO DO THE HARD WORK TO GET THEM IN THE RECOVERY- BUT IF WE HAVE A CHOICE WHICH IS WHAT THE CHOICES BEFORE US TODAY CLEAN NEEDLE OR DIRTY NEEDLE I GO WITH A CLEAN YOU KNOW FROM THE PHARMACIST ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR OR REMOTELY CENTER PAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT- WHAT HE SAID WAS UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY- FIRST OF ALL THIS IS ABOUT REDUCTION IN THE SPREAD OF HIV AND HEPATITIS C. BOTH WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OF SOMEONE TAXES THAT THEY CAN GIVE IT TO OTHER PEOPLE. SECOND MIGHT STILL WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THERE'S NO INCREASE IN CRIME SO I APPRECIATE THE POINTING OUT ABOUT CRIME AND DECREASING BUT WHAT DOES DOIS IT DECREASES THE SPREAD OF INFECTION WITHOUT INCREASING CRIME RATES WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S A GOOD COMMON SENSE THING TO DO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AND I WERE CHAIRS OF THE BLACK CAUCUS THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN THE LATINO CAUCUS WE WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS RACIAL AND GENDER GENDER DISPARITIES AT TECH COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY. THAT WAS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN DO A FEW COMPANIES HAVE ACTED UPON THEIR COMMITMENTS TO DIVERSITY SIR SIR SEVERE ON REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN THE TECH INDUSTRY HAVE CONTINUED TO THIS DAY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROBLEM IS NOT UNIQUE TO TECH COMPANIES WOMEN AND MINORITIES ARE UNDER REPRESENTED ACROSS WHAT COLOR INDUSTRIES ESPECIALLY AT THE MANAGERIAL AND EXECUTIVE LEVELS IN RESPONSE TO THE PERS PERVASIVE UNDER UNDER REPRESENTATION OF MINORITIES. AND THE FOLLOWING AND FOLLOWING THE SUCCESS OF SENATOR JACKSON'S S. B. EIGHT TWO SIX ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVEN MINE NINE WOULD REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF ONE DIRECTOR FROM AN UNREPRESENTED COMMUNITY ON ALL BOARDS OF PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF TWO DIRECTORS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES FOR BOARDS THAT HAD FIVE TO EIGHT DIRECTORS. AND THREE DIRECTORS FOR BOARD BOARDS WITH MORE THAN. NINE DIRECTORS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUREAU OF STATISTICS AS REPORTED THAT IN 201890% OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE WHITE. WHILE CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON BUTTON BEING MINORITY. WELL CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING A MINORITY MAJORITY STATE CORPORATIONS DO NOT REFLECT THE VAST CULTURAL WEALTH IN THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE OF THE TOP TEN CALIFORNIA BANKS ONLY 30% OF THE DIRECTORS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS STATISTIC PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE 67% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION THERE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR RESEARCH BY THE LATINO CORPORATE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION FOUND THAT AS OF JULY FIRST 202087% OF CALIFORNIA SIX HUNDRED SIXTY TWO PUBLIC COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE A LATINO ON BOARD. AS YOU ALL KNOW LATINOS MAKE UP THIRTY NINE POINT FOUR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY ARE SEVERELY UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE BOARDROOM. CALIFORNIA IS BETTER THAN THIS WE ARE THE MOST DIVERSE STATE IN THE NATION IN OUR CORPORATIONS NEED TO EMULATE OUR DIVERSITY WE CAN ALSO LOOK TO SILICON VALLEY FOR EXAMPLES OF UNDER REPRESENTATION ON AVERAGE BLACK AND LATINO TECH COMPANIES MAKE UP LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. OF WORKERS AT PREMIER COMPANIES SUCH AS GOOGLE APPLE MICROSOFT FACEBOOK AND LINKEDIN THIS PERCENTAGES DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE ROUGHLY 20% OF COMPUTER SCIENCE GRADUATE THAT ARE BLACK OR LATINO. ASIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS MAKE UP A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE WHITE COLLAR WORKFORCE PER AT THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED TO MOVE UP THE LADDER IN LIGHT OF RECENT SOCIAL AND RACIAL JUSTICE PROTESTS CORPORATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE CONDUCT REVIEWS OF THEIR WORKFORCE AND HAVE MADE PROMISES TO INCREASE DIVERSITY. MANY TCH GIANTS BEGAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN YET THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING HIRED AND PROMISED HAS NOT CHANGED A RECENT REPORT BY MCKINSEY AND COMPANY SHOWS THAT COMPANIES WITH A DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND I DIVERSE CORPORATE BOARD PERFORMED BETTER THAN BOARDS WITHOUT DIVERSITY. YET THE FACE OF THE WHITE COLOR ON EMPLOYEE REMAINS UNCHANGED BY CHANGING THE CORPORATE BOARD TO CHANGE THE COMPANY'S CULTURE A DIVERSE BOARD CONTRIBUTES TO THAT COMPANY. AND IT'S VALUES FOR DIVERSITY AND CAN READILY ADAPT TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF ITS WORKFORCE AND CUSTOMER BASE BY. S. A. B. NINE SEVEN NINE WAS AMENDED IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS TO ADD MYSELF AS A CO AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE A JOINT AUTHORS ADDING ADDITIONAL FINDINGS TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL CONSTITUENTS CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO REMOVE. THE DEADLINE FOR RECOMMENDATION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND ADDING LGBTQ TO THE DEFINITION OF UNDER PREPPERS AND IT COMMUNITIES THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE TODAY THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE A SUPPORT TO EIGHTY NINE SEVEN NINE AS A- THE VICE CHAIR OF THE HR LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- AND ALSO CHAIR OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE AND API AFFAIRS. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- EVEN IN THE API COMMITTEE AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IT'S ONLY CERTAIN SUBGROUPS OF THE API COMMUNITY THAT. SOME PEOPLE POINT OUT OF THROUGH THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH THAT WORSE YOU KNOW AT LEAST SOMEWHAT WELL REPRESENTED AND THE FOR SOME PROFESSIONS AND THAT LIKE ENGINEERING OR MEDICINE AND SO FORTH. BUT IN FACT THE API- THE SELECT ME ON API FARES OF THIS VERY SENATE TO HELP THE HEARING TO TALK ABOUT THE GLASS CEILING FOR API SO WHEN USE LOOK AT THE- ENTRY LEVEL RANKS AGAIN ONLY FOR SOME API SUBGROUPS OR MANY OTHER. API SEVENTIES PARTICULARLY ARE NATIVE HAWAIIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS OTHER- ASIAN SUBGROUPS THAT ACTUALLY DO ALSO CHALLENGES EVEN ON THE COLLEGE LEVEL OR THE ENTRY JOB LEVEL WHAT YOU SEE IS BY TIME YOU GET TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT. CEOS AND BOARDS- THAT BASICALLY WE ARE WOEFULLY UNDER REPRESENTED AS AS A GROUP AND THAT CERTAINLY OF COURSE IS ALSO AN ISSUE FOR- ALSO THE- BLACK AMERICANS AND FOR LATINOS AS AS WELL SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. BILL TO TRY TO BRING GREATER EQUITY TO BE SURE THE POLICY MAKING- PARTS OF OUR CORPORATIONS THAT'S WHAT THE BOARDS ARE AND THEY HOLD THE CEOS ACCOUNTABLE THEY ALSO ESTABLISHED POLICY. THAT WE HAVE THE REPRESENTATION THERE SO THAT- THE CORPORATIONS WHICH CONTROL A VAST AMOUNT OF OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES- IN IN NOT ONLY IN OUR STATE BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE TRUE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE AND OUR COMMUNITIES. I DON'T DENY THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER PAN MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR SEEING NONE GOING TO OUR REMOTE VOTING MEMBERS SEEING NO HANDS. HOPE CENTER GROVE. PLEASE PROCEED. I THINK YOU MADAM FOR. AM I UP THE OF THIS. SHINSHU BE. AND I'M I LOOK AT EVEN MIGHT ABOARD I WAS JUST LOOKING AT MY BOARD AND WE HAVE SIX NUMBERS ON MY BOARD OF MY PRIVATE COMPANY AND- YOU KNOW STE TWO OF THEM ARE THREE OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND- TWO ARE HISPANICS. AND LATINOS AND SO- THEY'VE RETARDED JUST LIKE THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THE BOARD TO BE IN THAT POSITION AND SO. I THINK THAT- JUST LIKE IT WAS- MICE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO MENTION THAT- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE PORTS CONTROL A LOT OF RESOURCES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTROLS A LOT OF RESOURCES TO. AND SO I JUST THINK THAT IN PRIVATE BUSINESS- BOARD SHOULD BE ELECTED- AND PEOPLE SHOULD BE PUT ON BOARDS THAT ARE OUR BEST REPRESENT THE BUSINESS. AND THAT COULD BE ANYBODY SKIN COLOR IT'S JUST A QUALIFICATION IT'S A REQUIREMENT SO I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE COMING BACK. TO THE SENATE FLOOR SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M NOT A PRESIDENT OF A QUESTION OF THE FLOOR MANAGER PLEASE. CENTER WAS WE TAKE A QUESTION ABSOLUTELY PLEASE PROCEED. SENATE HUESO IS THERE ANY LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD SUGGEST. RACE GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION SHOULD TROP- PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE ON WHAT- FICTIONAL VALUE ONE WOULD BRING TO THE BOARD NONE AT ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU ARE YOU KNOW I THINK THERE IS A MANTRA THAT IF YOU. TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY YOU'RE SOMEHOW MOVING AWAY FROM MERIT OR QUALIFICATIONS AND THAT IS SIMPLY UNTRUE THE REALITY IS THAT FOREVER AS LONG AS THEIR BIG CORPORATIONS- WE HAVE SEEN A PROFOUND LACK OF REPRESENTATION ON CORPORATE BOARDS BY WOMEN BY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND BY LGBTQ. PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF QUALIFIED DIRECTORS IN THESE COMMUNITIES BUT BECAUSE OUR SOCIETY HAS BEEN STRUCTURED DATA. THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE DOES NOT REPRESENTED AND IT BECOMES A SORT OF AN OLD BOYS NETWORK WITH ALL RESPECT I AND SO TAKING PROACTIVE STEPS TO SAY WE HAD A NICE MASSIVE POOL ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE POOL. ARE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED. PEOPLE CALL OF EMINENTLY. LGBTQ PEOPLE AND YOU NEED TO BE INTENTIONAL AND PROACTIVE TO IDENTIFY WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT THERE AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE. AND TO HAVE MORE DIVERSE SPORTS WE HAVE TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS. TO REMEDY THE STRUCTURAL RACISM AND HOMOPHOBIA AND TRANSPHOBIA THAT HAS INFECTED THE SOCIETY AND THIS WORLD FOREVER AND THIS BILL WILL HELP US DO THAT AND AYE URGENT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND AS THE VICE YOU'RE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS ARE WE SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. AND IT'S NO SECRET AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES OF OURS STATED THAT MANY OF THE MOST QUALIFIED PEOPLE ARE NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE AND THEY'RE USING PEOPLE OF COLOR USING WOMEN WHO ARE IGNORE. THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO SPENT TWENTY YEARS IN CORPORATE AMERICA. I KNOW MANY OF TIMES THEY WOULD ALWAYS SAY WE CAN'T FIND WE CAN FINE WHEN THEY'RE PLENTY QUALIFIED LATINOS AFRICAN AMERICANS ASIANS OUT THERE BUT THEY CHOOSE NOT TO LOOK FORM. AND AS STATED THIS IS USING THE OLD BOYS NETWORK FIELD WITH NEPOTISM AND CRONYISM OF MANY CORPORATIONS BECAUSE AS I LEARNING CORPORATION PEOPLE HIRED IN A POINT BILLS PEOPLE WHO REMIND THE MOST OF THEMSELVES OF THEIR- PRIMARILY WHITE MALE DOMINATED GOT TO THEY'RE GONNA HIRE THAT'S EITHER GOING TO POINT AND NOT TO THE BOARDS MADE UP. DIVERSITY SHOULD BE AND CORPORATIONS DNA AND NOT JUST CHECKING A BOX AND I THINK THIS IS A STRONG MEASURE TO MAKE SURE THAT. DIVERSITY IS PART OF THESE CORPORATIONS BY DIVERSIFYING THE BOARDS ARE STRUNG OUT FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD. CENTER TO RAZA. IT'S COMING. GO AHEAD. PUSH ONE MORE TIME. WELL THERE WE GO I WASN'T CLOSE ATTENTION AND YES I KNOW YOU WERE DOING GOOD PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU THANK YOU I RISE AS A WOMAN I RISE AS A LATINA I RISE UP ON THE ISSUE OF HAVING A HEALTHY SOCIETY THAT INTEGRATES EVERYONE FROM OUR COMMUNITIES THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND I GET QUITE OFFENDED. WHEN SOMEBODY THINKS THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A RECRUITMENT EFFORT A PROACTIVE EFFORT TO INTEGRATE INTO EVERY ASPECT OF OUR SOCIETY THAT SOMEHOW THAT MEANS WE'RE LOWERING THE STANDARDS SO I RISE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR AND SEEING NO HANDS REYES REMOTELY SENATE HUESO YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THAT DISCUSSION. YOU KNOW I RECENTLY SAW A REPORT THAT REFERENCE A STUDY THAT WAS DONE. THAT MEASURED AND TRACKED. THAT MEASURED AND TRACKED THE OPERATIVE OWNERSHIP OF FARMERS AND AMERICAN FOLLOWING THE WAR HE SHOWED A MAP OF HOW MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS ACTUALLY OWN FORMS AND HOW OVER TIME BUT OWNERSHIP INTEREST HAS DECLINED AND THEIR FARMS HAVE SHRUNK. AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WERE CITED AS A LOT OF THESE FARMERS COULD NEVER OVER THE COURSE OF THOSE YEARS ACCESS CAPITAL WELL THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL FARMERS THE COULD NOT MODERNIZED THEIR FARMS IN MANY CASES THEY LOST THEIR FORM FARMS MANY CASE THEY HAD SSL OFF LAND TO STAY IN BUSINESS. AND ONE OF ONE OF THE THERE WAS A CASE IN ACTUAL THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY IN WHICH- ONE PHARNEXT LOCATED NEXT EXTRA NUMBER ONE ONE OF THEM WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN ONE ONE WAS ANGLED. ANGLE GOT A HEFTY LOAN THAT WAS ABLE TO HELP THEM GET A TRACTOR IN THE- AND THE FARMER NEXT DOOR COULD NOT GET A LOAN SO THEY HAD TO PERFORM A LOT OF THESE TASKS. MANUALLY AND SPEND MORE TIME TRYING TO RUN THEIR FARM. MINUTE TALKS ABOUT A CONDITION THAT IS EXISTS IN OUR COUNTRY THE CURRENT CURRENTLY EXIST. IN THE DOESN'T ALLOW A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS ECONOMY. I ALSO WANT TO SHARE AN EXAMPLE OF A FRIEND OF MINE THAT HAPPENS TO BE LATINO. THAT WAS PARTNERED WITH AN ANGLE PARTNER ON A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. HE WENT TO THE BANK TO ASK FOR A LOAN. AND THEY DECLINED. WHEN HE SENT HIS ANGLE PARTNERED AFTER THIS IN THAT THE SME BANK FOR THE LOAN THAT THEY THEY GRANTED IT. AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS. A LOT OF AS A STRUCTURAL AN INHERENT BIAS. IN IN OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THIS BILL IS A GOOD FOR BUSINESS BILL ADDING. DIVERSITY TO BUSINESS WILL HELP BUSINESS IN OUR STATE BECOME MORE SUCCESSFUL I ALSO WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE. THAT THIS BILL IS VERY APPROPRIATE FOR THE TIME RIGHT NOW BY WE NEED TO APPROVE THIS IMMEDIATELY THIS PANDEMIC HAS SHOWED US HOW PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE BEEN AFFECTED DISPROPORTIONATELY BY THE PANDEMIC. WE KNOW THAT LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS HAPPEN TO BE. A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THE OF IN OTHER WORDS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA OR OR THAT ARE LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY JOBS AND HEALTH CARE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THERE THEY'VE BEEN AFFECTED DISPROPORTIONATELY BY THE PANDEMIC THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME THAT WE START. TO MOVE FORWARD TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY IN THE STATE TO PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN IN A IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DISPUT DISPROPORTIONATELY DENIED THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. BILL IN THIS WOULD REALLY SET CALIFORNIA PART IS A NATION THAT'S REALLY RECOGNIZING THE DIVERSITY MATTERS AND THAT IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS A LITTLE IMPROVE OUR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CLIMATE THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FORTY THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS AND AFTER LEADING TO EMPLOYMENT AND DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY CENTER CABALLERO THANK YU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FORTY THREE THE AGRICULTURAL WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY ACT ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL WORKERS DURING THE COLD ED NINETEEN CRISIS BY RICK REQUIRING CAL OSHA TO ENFORCE EXISTING HEALTH. AND SAFETY GUIDELINES AND CONDUCT A TARGETED OUTREACH CAMPAIGN THE CAMPAIGN WOULD CONSIST OF PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT AND WORKPLACE SIGNS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND INFORMATION WOULD BE DISSEMINATED USING PICTOGRAMS TO REACH THE WORKERS THAT DO NOT COMMUNICATE IN EITHER LANGUAGE ADDITIONALLY% THIS OUTRAGE CAMPAIGN WOULD INCLUDE INFORMATION ON PAID SICK LEAVE WORKERS COMPENSATION AND COVERT NINETEEN RELATED EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS LASTLY THE BILL REQUIRES CAL OSHA TO POST ON ITS WEBSITE INFORMATION RELATED TO INVESTIGATIONS OF AGRICULTURAL WORKPLACES. WE NEED GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE AGAINST UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS MANY AG WORKERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED OFTEN LACK ASK ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES AND LIVING IN CLOSE QUARTERS THE COVERED NINETEEN VIRUS FURTHER EXACERBATES EXISTING CHALLENGES ADD WORKERS ALREADY FACE AND AS WE KNOW THE INFECTION RATE AMONG AG WORKERS. IS STAGGERING. CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HAS KNOWN ME AND IN SIGHT THE MESSAGE THE WORKPLACE SAFETY ISSUES BEFORE MORE AG WORKERS GET SICK THE BILL HAS A BROAD RANGE OF SUPPORT AND NO OPPOSITION THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. CENTERED RAZA. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FORTY THREE IT'S A PRIORITY BECAUSE LATINOS DO MAKE UP A VAST MAJORITY OF THE ESSENTIAL AGRICULTURAL WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY HAVE HAD TO CONTINUE WORKING THROUGHOUT THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC DESPITE. THE HIGH RISK OF EXPOSURE AT THEIR WORKPLACES AS A RESULT WELL AT THE END OF COMPRISES THIRTY EIGHT POINT 9% THE POPULATION THEY ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST 55% OF THE COLBERT NINETEEN CASES IT IS THEREFORE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE ACT TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS HELP LESSEN THE POSSIBILITY OF COLBERT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS AMONGST THEM. BY SHARING HEALTH AND SAFETY BEST PRACTICES AND ENSURE THE FUNCTION ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR MUCH NEEDED FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS- FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR SEEING NONE. SEEING NO HANDS REYES FROM OUR REMOTE MEMBERS I DO SEE A HAND REYES SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW I WHEN I SAW THIS BILL COME OUT BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT TO ADD THE SECOND LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCING COUNTY. IN THE WORLD FRANKLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS THE TOP THREE I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH AND- REQUIRED- ASK INQUIRED- FROM COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ABOUT THEIR PROCESSES IN PLACE. TO PROTECT THE ACT BE OUR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS THAT PRODUCE STATED. AND I WAS PROVIDED WITH PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE ENGLISH SPANISH MON. AND COMPLYING WITH CDC GUIDELINES- THERE WERE PICTURES IN THESE PACKETS. ED TO HELP PEOPLE THAT WERE MAYBE LIMITED IN NOT ONLY ENGLISH BUT LIMITED IN AND YOU KNOW EDUCATION. THERE WERE- THERE IT WAS JUST A COMPLETE I MEAN PACKET AFTER PACKET HAD ALL THIS INFORMATION AND IT WAS PROTECTING THESE WORKERS. AND BUT ONE THING THAT I DID FIND IS THAT IN OUR FOOD PROCESSING PLANTS LIKE THE PULL TRICKS TO PASS SEEMS PRACTICING PLANTS THAT WERE UNDER A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET SAFETY INFORMATION OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE IT AND- AGREED UPON BY EIGHT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA. INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MORE DEATHS OCCUR IN THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS- THERE WAS TO PACKING PLANTS THAT WERE SHUT DOWN ONE DEFINITELY UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND BECAUSE OF THE FATALITIES AT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN COPING NINETEEN BUT THAT PARTICULAR PLANT WAS UNDER A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. SO WHILE I THINK THAT- ALL EMPLOYERS ARE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PROTECT THEIR WORKERS. THAT PROCESS IS IN PLACE AS FAST AS THEY CAN- YOU KNOW I WISH I DON'T KNOW THAT A LOT OF BUSINESSES HAD PANDEMIC OR CDC GUIDELINES OR- THINGS LIKE THAT IN PLACE PRIOR TO. THE SITUATION THAT WE GET WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS YEAR BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT- WITH THE COMPANIES THAT I EAT I CHECKED WITH. THEM PROVIDED EXTENUATING INFORMATION AND THEY'VE MITIGATED A LOT OF THE EXPOSURE THAT THEY HAVE- WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND I THINK IT PLACING UNFAIR BURDENS ON COMPANIES AND EMPLOYEES THAT ARE TRYING TO JUST. A PROVIDE FOOD FOR A TABLE IS NOT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THAT AND I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THE CENTER GROVE SENIOR FOR THEIR HANDS UP SEEING NO MEMBERS WITH THEIR MIKES UP SOONER CABALLERO YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I COULD REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- BY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM. THIS CENTRAL VALLEY LET ME JUST SAY THAT. THE OF THE CODE NINE IN. THAT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST FOR ME IS THAT I REPRESENT. PARTS OF OR ALL OF SIX COUNTIES. AND EACH COUNTY HAS A SEPARATE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH EXACTLY WHAT THE COUNTY. A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IS SAYING AND DOING WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WITH THIS BILL DOES IS IT'S AN EDUCATION IT'S AN INFORMATION. BILL THAT REQUIRES CAL OSHA TO STANDARDIZE THE INFORMATION THAT GOES OUT TO ALL OF THE AGRICULTURAL WORKPLACES AND STANDARDIZES THE EDUCATION AND INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR QUITE FRANKLY- THAT BOTH FROM THE LATINO CAUCUS AND OTHER INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR CAL OSHA. TO GIVE US SOME REAL GOOD GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT THE SAFETY OBLIGATIONS SHOULD BE AND HOW PEOPLE CAN KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE I THINK THE FACT THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE. THE INFECTION RATE AMONG FARMWORKERS BE EXTREMELY HIGH IS A CLEAR INDICATION THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND THIS BILL DOES THAT IT'S AN EDUCATION ADVISEMENT AND ANNA TRANSPARENCY BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

MEMBERS AS A PROUD PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR OF AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX. I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WHICH ADDRESSES THE STATE'S POOR TRACK RECORD. OF ENSURING THAT CHILDREN MOST AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING ARE SCREENED AND TESTED FOR LEAD POISONING. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD FOR CHILDREN ALL CHILDREN CAN BE HARMED BY LEAD BUT CHILDREN FROM LOWER INCOME FAMILIES. ARE SPECIALLY AT RISK. 88% OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WHO ARE LEAD POISONED RECEIVE MEDICAL. EARLIER THIS YEAR A REPORT BY THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN. COVERED BY MEDICAID ALL DID NOT RECEIVE PROPER LEAD TESTING CONCLUDED. THAT ONLY 27% OF MEDICAL CHILDREN. RECEIVE THE TEST REQUIRED. AB TWO TWO SEVEN SIX ADDRESSES THE STATE'S POOR CHILD LEAD TESTING RATES Y ONE. HOLDING MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR LEAD TESTING. THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. TO REQUIRING PLANTS TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN WHO MISLED TEST REMIND DOCTORS THAT CHILDREN MUST BE TESTED. A REPORT TO THE STATE WHEN CHILDREN ARE NOT TESTED. THREE ENACT ADICIONAL RISK FACTORS FOR HEALTH EXPOSURE. AND FOR REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO UPDATE ITS CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM FUNDING FORMULA.

AB TWO TWO SEVEN SIX HOLES MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR TESTING CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. REQUIRES A STATE TO UPDATE ITS LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM.

WHEN THIS BILL WAS HEARD IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE AYE I SHARED HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO ME MY DISTRICT OF COURSE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND TO HOW THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING IT'S REALLY IMPACTING OUR OUR CHILDREN MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN PARTICULAR ARE DEALING WITH THIS YEAR'S ISSUE RIGHT NOW. IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME WHEN THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT RELEASED IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUND THAT MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. ONE YEAR OLD AND TWO YEAR OLD CHILDREN HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE STATE REQUIRED BLOOD LEAD TESTS THAT'S- UNACCEPTABLE THAT FIGURE PUTS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION AT RISK AND I STRONGLY URGE AND I VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND RUBIO GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER DRUGS SO WE RECOGNIZE pCHAIRMAN. AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO CAUCUS. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX. THIS BILL IS A PRIORITY FOR US BECAUSE LEAD POISONING. DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS MINORITY CHILDREN WERE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN COMMUNITIES WITH LEAD CONTAMINATED DUST. IN OLDER BUILDINGS AND SUB STANDARD HOUSING. LATINOS ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. COMPARED TO NON HISPANIC WHITES. AND THE EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING ARE YOU REIMBURSABLE. OFTEN LEADING TO LIFELONG MEDICAL DISABILITIES AND COMPLICATIONS. BY ESTABLISHING ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS NEWS. HELLO MECHANISMS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD MEDIC CAL LEAD TESTING. WE CAN ENSURE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN ARE PROTECTED. NOT THE MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN MEDIC CAL. MORE NOT RECEIVING PROPER LEAD TESTS UNDER CURRENT LAW. ARE PROPERLY SCREENED TESTED AND TREATED THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE SIXTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MURATSUCHI AN ACT RELATING TO FIREARMS SENATOR WIENER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT A. B. TWENTY THREE SIXTY TWO ON BEHALF OF THE SUMMER MURATSUCHI. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY TWO AND FORCES COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS BY AUTHORIZING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO FIND. IRRESPONSIBLE GUN DEALERS THE BILL WILL INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW BY ALLOWING DOJ TO FIND DEALERS FOR VIOLATIONS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE ALL OR NOTHING. YOU EITHER DO NOTHING OR REVOKE THE LICENSE ENTIRELY- AND MOVING AWAY FROM IT ALL OR NOTHING CHOICE DOJ HAS EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT TOOLS- AND A MIDDLE GROUND SHORT OR LICENSE REVOCATION. THAT IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- THE AUTHORITY GRANTED IN THIS BILL SIMILAR TO THE AB TO ABC'S ABILITY TO ADMINISTER FINES- IN LIEU OF REVOKING A LIQUOR LICENSE. ON AS GUN SALES INCREASE IT IS IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA GUN DEALERS ARE FOLLOWING OUR GUN LAWS THE TWENTY THREE SIXTY TWO IS SPONSORED BY THE BRADY CAMPAIGN'S AND SUPPORTED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SEEING NO ONE ON THE FLOOR R. O. MEMBERS PARTICIPATING. REMOTELY SENATOR GROVE. HE MET A PRESS I RISE IN OUR- OF BILL IT'S NOT OUR GANG DEALERS AND THOSE THAT ARE LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL. IT'S INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MORE LIKE CREE. OBTAINING ILLEGALLY THAT ARE CAUSING IN WREAKING HAVOC WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN OUR STATE IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PANDEMIC- THE AUTHOR WAS RIGHT THAT THE- GUN SALES HAVE-INCREASED AGAIN CELLS HAVE INCREASED TO NEW GUN OWNERS ARE PRIMARILY BECAUSE- OF THE CHAOS IN THE STREETS AND THEN WANTING TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES. SO GUN DEALERS ARE DOING THEIR VERY BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY FOLLOW THAT THEY ARE DOING THEIR VERY BEST AND THEY DO FOLLOW ALL OF THE GUIDELINES- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES INSTEAD OF PROHIBITING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AND LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS AND LAW ABIDING RETAIL SERVICES. TO PROVIDE UM SERVICES THAT ARE REQUESTED BY THE CITIZENS OF OUR STATE- WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUES ABOUT ILLEGALLY OBTAINING FIREARMS WHICH IS TAKING PLACE. ON OUR ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THAT'S EVIDENT BECAUSE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ARRESTED OR PULLED OVER AND FOR INSTANCE I COULD NAME SEVERAL BIG ARRESTED THAT ARE PULLED OVER. BETTER ILLEGALLY AND DRIVING WITHOUT A DRIVER'S LICENSE HAVE AN ILLEGAL FIREARM IN THEIR POSSESSION NO LICENSED AUTHORIZED AND DEALER AB SOLD THAT FIREARMS IT A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL I'M REGARDING THAT A POLICE SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. SO I JUST I JUST STRESS TO THE FACT THAT- YOU KNOW ATTACKING LAW ABIDING BUSINESSES LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS LAW ABIDING CITIZENS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOT ADDRESSING CRIMINAL ELEMENT. AS WHERE IT PEOPLE ARE OBTAINING ILLEGAL FIREARMS IS ADAMS IS- JUST NEEDS TO GET DEFINITELY JUST NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO I WOULD ROOF I REQUEST AN OVERCOAT. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE. SENATOR NIELSEN. NO THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER FURTHER TO. OR TO. SEEING AND HEARING SENATE WE KNOW WHICH TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT LAW ABIDING GUN DEALERS THIS IS ABOUT GUN DEALERS WHO VIOLATE THE LAW. AND WHAT IT DOES IT'S FRANKLY IN THE INTERESTS OF GUN DEALERS THAT IF YOU VIOLATE THE LAW PERHAPS IN A NOT EXTREME WAY. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A CHOICE THEIR ONLY OPTION IF THEY WANT TO GO OUT TO YOU IS TO REVOKE YOUR LICENSE. GIVEN THE AGV OPPORTUNITY. TO SEEK A FINE INSTEAD OF REVOKING OUR LICENSE SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT GUN DEALERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM AND AGAIN THIS IS ONLY WITH RESPECT TO GUN DEALERS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY VIOLATED THE LAW.

KALRA RISE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE- THIS LEGISLATION WILL PROTECT USED TO PARTICIPATE IN DIVERSION PROGRAMS FROM THE NEGATIVE COST CONSEQUENCES OF AN UNSEALED RECORDS WHEN A USER COMPLETES A DIVERSION PROGRAM UNDER EXISTING LAW. ASIAN THE DIVERSION SERVICE PROVIDER ARE BOTH REQUIRED TO SEAL THE RECORDS BUT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT. THIS MEANS THAT EVEN FOR YOU DOES EVERYTHING NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THEIR DIVERSION PROGRAM AND IF THEY SUCCESSFULLY STATE OUT OF THE JUVENILE COURT SYSTEM WE WILL NEVER THE LESS SADDLE THEM WITH AN UNSEALED POLICE RECORD. WHAT'S MORE FOR YOU TOWARD DIVERTED BY THE POLICE WHERE THEY DON'T GO TO COURT AT ALL. WHO WHO ARE SIMPLY COUNSELED AND RELEASED BY THE POLICE NO AUTOMATIC SEALING PROTECTIONS EXIST EVEN IF THEY HAVE NEVER TOUCHED. THE PROBATION OR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEREFORE WE SEE THE PERVERSE RESULT THEY USED TO ACTUALLY AND AVOID SYSTEM INVOLVEMENTS FOR POLICE TO VERSION ACTUALLY HAVE FEWER CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS. THEN YOU TO ACTUALLY ENTER THE SYSTEM AND OF COURSE WHY WOULD WE CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO ENTER THE SYSTEM. AS WE CONTINUE TO DIVERT YOUTH AWAY FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE NEED TO HOLD UP OUR END OF THE BARGAIN AND PROTECT THEM FROM THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF OUR FLAWED SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC RELEASE OF THESE RECORDS. IT IS UNFAIR TO THE BURKE USED TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THESYSTEM PROMISE THEM A CLEAN RECORD AND SURPRISE HIM DOWN THE ROAD WITH THE POLICE RECORD THAT COULD PREVENT THEM FROM ACCESSING EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT. OR HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES A RECENT AMENDMENTS ALLOW A PROSECUTING ATTORNEY TO ACCESS YOUR RECORDS IN CERTAIN CASES IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR BRADY OBLIGATIONS. TO THE CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY.

WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT MAKES HIS ARREST RECORDS FOR THE VERSION. ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY WE TREAT OTHER OUR RECORDS FOR YOU YOU'RE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM- THERE'S NOT A LIMIT. WE HAVE MADE A POLICY DECISION THAT WHEN USE COMPLETE THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO SEE OLDER RECORDS SO IT DOESN'T HAUNT THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND WE- WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CLEAN SLATE. AND MOVE ON AND BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE THIS IS A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT FEELS A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEIR RECORDS. BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON DIDN'T GET AROUND THE CEILING THEIR ARREST RECORDS. IF THEY WENT THROUGH A DIVERSION PROGRAM WHERE THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY ANSWER- THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM- AND SO WE WANT TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE- AND WHETHER THEY'RE ARRESTED ONCE OR MORE THAN ONCE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE. KIDS CAN HAVE A CLEAN SLATE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. NO MAN THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT UP I SEE SENATOR BORCHERT'S IS HANSON GORGEOUS.

ONLY FOR PURPOSES OF POLICE INVESTIGATIONS OR THESE PUBLICLY DISCLOSEABLE ARREST RECORDS. IS ALL OF THEIR ARREST RECORDS. WHAT I'M WHAT I'M WHAT I'M WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THAT IF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION DO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE RECORDS THAT WOULD AID THEM IN. INVESTIGATION WAR IS ARE THESE ARREST RECORDS- OBTAINABLE BY THE PUBLIC. SO IS IT LIMITED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- OR IS IT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. IT SEALED AREA. SOME ACCESS IT FOR INVESTIGATIONS LAW NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND EXCEPT FOR A DISTRICT ATTORNEY- TO FULFILL THEIR BRADY OBLIGATIONS NO NO. CURRENTLY THE WAY THINGS WORK RIGHT NOW- CURRENTLY- YEAH IT COULD BECOME PUBLIC- LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN ACCESS IT AND IT CAN BECOME PUBLIC. OKAY AND THEN WE WANT TO SEAL IT JUST OTHER.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWO THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEBER AND ACTUALLY THE STATE GOVERNMENT SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE WITH ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE TO THE STATE TO STUDY. AND DEVELOP REPARATION PROPOSALS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE TASK FORCE TO RECOMMEND THE APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS FOR REDRESS AS IT PERTAINS SPECIFICALLY TO CALIFORNIA'S ROLE IN THE ENSLAVEMENT OF BLACK PEOPLE AND THE LEGACY OF THE SINCE LATE MEANT. BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S STATEHOOD IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY IN THE END OF SLAVERY NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE CALIFORNIA WAS CONSIDERED A FREE STATE IN NAME ONLY. WITH MUNICIPAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES ACTIVELY SUPPORTING BLACK AND SLATE MEANT IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE THIS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED SEVEN SLAVEHOLDERS TO HOLD PERSONS IN BONDAGE SO LONG AS THEY GET INTO THE STATE WITH THEIR IN FLIGHT PROPERTY PRIOR TO STATEHOOD IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY. CALIFORNIA'S JUDICIAL BRANCH ALSO HELPED PROP UP THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO CALIFORNIA ADOPTED A HARSH FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT. EMPOWERING STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO FORCE ITSELF EMANCIPATED PERSONS LIVING WITHIN THE STATE BACK INTO CHAINS OF ENSLAVEMENT. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ORDERED FUGITIVE SLAVES AS IN THE HISTORIC CASE OF ARCHIE LEE RETURNED TO THEIR IN FLAVORS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION. MY OWN HOME MY OWN HOMETOWN OF LOS ANGELES IN THE ACTUAL DISTRICT I CURRENTLY REPRESENT DOWNTOWN LA HAS A SIMILAR ISSUE WITH THE WOMAN BY THE NAME OF BETTY MASON WHO ACTUALLY HAD TO ARGUE HER OWN CASE IN COURT. TO PREVENT HER IN FLAVOR FROM RETURNING HER TO THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. WELL THIS HISTORY IS NOT PART OF STATE. LOWER OR SCHOOL CURRICULA IT DOES OFFER CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF CALIFORNIA'S COMPLICITY IN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN FACT THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES OF THE PAST ECHO IN THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF BLACK CALIFORNIANS TODAY. ACCORDING TO GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S TWENTY TWENTY STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS BLACK PEOPLE MAKE UP 80% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION. HOWEVER 43% OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA ARE BLACK. AND THE PERCENTAGE IS MUCH HIGHER IN OTHER IN SOME OF OUR LARGER COUNTIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES ACCOUNT FOR TWENTY EIGHT POINT 5% OF THE STATE'S FEMALE PRISON POPULATION DESPITE THE FACT THAT BLACK MEN MAKE UP JUST FIVE POINT 6% OF THE STATE ADULT MALES. A RECENT STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE L. A. L. STATES THAT BY NEARLY EVERY STATE MEASURE BLACK K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS HAVE THE LOWEST PERFORMANCE OF ANY RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS. EVEN AS WE DEBATE THE NEED FOR THIS STUDY COVERT NINETEEN ISSUED A SOBERING LIGHT ON THE CULMINATION OF THESE PERSISTENT DISPARITIES. EMERGING DATA CONFIRMS THAT A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF ILLNESS AND DEATH GET A CALL THAT NINETEEN FALL ON THE BLACK COMMUNITY. SO LET'S BE CLEAR. CHATTEL SLAVERY BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS OUR NATION BIRTH A LEGACY OF RACIAL HARMONY AND INEQUITY THAT CONTINUES TO IMPACT THE CONDITIONS OF BLACK LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE WHO SUFFER INJURIES THE LOSSES TO THE MALICIOUS OR CALL PROBABLY NEGLECT CONDUCT THE BROTHERS HAVE A RIGHT TO REDRESS. AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE COULD WOULD REQUIRE AN IN DEPTH EXAMINATION OF THE IMPACT OF SLAVERY IN CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES ON HOW TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES BORN OF A SHAMEFUL HISTORY. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL MEMBERS HERE ON THE FLOOR DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I STAND IN SUPPORT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS A BODY THAT WE UNDERSTAND THIS CALIFORNIANS THIS INITIATIVE IN PROPOSAL FOR NO MORE THAN A STEADY AND THE CONVERSATION IS LONG OVERDUE. AND STANDS TO BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST THOSE THE VICTIMS OF A HISTORY OF SLAVERY WE'RE ALL VICTIMS OF THAT HISTORY I HEARD TONIGHT VOTE. THANK YOU CEREMONY MOVING TO OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE VOTING REMOTELY I SEE SENATOR BORCHERS HIS HAND UP SENATOR BORDERS. THANK YOU. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WE COME ACROSS PIECE LEGISLATION THAT CAPTURES THE IMAGINATION AND THIS HAS CERTAINLY CAPTURED MY ATTENTION AND MY IMAGINATION. MOSTLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL- MAYBE YOU KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN GREEK AND ARMENIAN RELATED ISSUES. AND FOR YEARS I HAVE ADVOCATED THAT GREEKS AND ARMENIANS WERE VICTIMIZED BY THE OTTOMANS THE AUTUMN IN TURKS BE GIVEN PROPER VENUE FOR REPARATIONS. BEING AN ISSUE ORIGINALLY FROM ARIZONA- WE HAD LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE NATIVE AMERICANS WENT THROUGH AND THEIR TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY RELATED ISSUES. AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO CHAMPION THOSE CAUSES IN THIS RESPECT AND SO NATURALLY WHEN THIS. ISSUE CAME UP IT CAPTURED MY IMAGINATION BECAUSE I WANT. SUCH A TASK FORCE IF IT'S CREATED AND IT WILL BE I SUSPECT. THAT IT BE ON THE MERITS AND IT BEING ELEVATED TO A LEVEL WHERE EXPERTS IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS PROPERLY BACKGROUND. CAN LEAD THE CHARGE ON THIS AND SO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A REALLY LONG CONVERSATION WITH THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WHO IS ALTERING THIS BILL AND THEN WHEN IT CAME TO JUDICIARY I PUT FORWARD SOME WHAT I BELIEVE ARE POSITIVE RECOMMENDATIONS- ONE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS APPOINTED. BEING PROPERLY CREDENTIALED AND REPARATIONS RELATED TOPICS WHETHER THEY HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS YOU KNOW SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID OR HOLOCAUST FOR JAPANESE INTERNMENT SOMETHING WITHIN THAT BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP- WAR CHU MIN RIGHTS AMERICAN HISTORY ONE GETTING OUT WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT I WAS CONCERNED THAT HAVING SO MANY LEGISLATIVE APPOINTEES IN THE ORIGINAL DRAFT. WOULD DRAG. DOWN HIS TASK FORCE AND I WAS HOPING THAT WOULD BE ELEVATED. TO AN EXPERT LEVEL OF REVIEW BY THOSE WHO HAVE A STRONG BACKGROUND IN TEAM RELATED TOPICS- I HAD WANTED ALSO TO PROPERLY REPRESENT THE BREAKDOWN OF CALIFORNIA. AND EVEN THOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF FOLKS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ACROSS STATE AFFILIATE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY I THOUGHT IT COULD BE HELPFUL IF IT LEADS ONE APPOINTING COULD BE FROM THE MINORITY LEADERSHIP IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. SO I PROPOSE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN WEBER- WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO WALK THROUGH THEM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE GOVERNOR STEPPED IN AND HAS SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED IT AND TAKEN A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I THINK ARE ARE HELPFUL- HE HAS TAKEN MORE OF THE APPOINTEES THAT WERE INITIALLY A LOT OF. REDUCE THE APPOINTEES FROM THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY AGAIN LEADERSHIP. AND IT'S PUT A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON OF THOSE HAVING THE ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND TO ELEVATE. THIS DISCUSSION. I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED STILL THAT THERE IS NOW OPPORTUNITY FOR- REPUBLICANS TO PARTICIPATE EVEN IN AN EMERGENCY REPUBLICANS ARE JUST FOLKS THAT ARE APPOINTED FROM THE REPUBLICAN- LEADERSHIP IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. SO I'M I HAVE SOME HEARTBURN HERE I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME SHORTCOMINGS IN THE COMPOSITION OF THIS OF THIS- TASK FORCE. AND GIVEN MY PAST EXPERIENCE WITH YOU KNOW WHAT. BEING ADVOCATE FOR OTHER FOLKS I WAS HOPING THAT THIS WOULD TO BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAD. FELL THAT THESE CHANGES MADE BY THE GOVERNOR AND AGREED TO BY THE AUTHOR- GOOD EVERYONE IS HAPPY WITH THE NEW COMPOSITION- BECAUSE I THINK IT STILL HAS SOME FUNDAMENTAL SHORTCOMINGS EVEN THOUGH I WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO SUCCEED. AND NONE OF THIS OF COURSE IS. OUR BINDING US TO WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE L. AS WE KNOW IT SO WE'RE NOT VOTING FOR REPARATIONS WERE VOTING FOR THE STUDY OF REPARATIONS BUT- I DO KNOW THAT IN MY COLLEAGUES HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE COMPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK. IF YOU WANT TO DO IT RIGHT AND YOU WANTED MAKE THIS. A TRUE PEACE A TRUE A TRUE LEGACY WITH CALIFORNIA LEADING THE WAY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES I BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE CERTAIN BOXES CHECKED. AND DID THE CURRENT COMPOSITION FALLS JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW THAT IN MY IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS. SEEING NO FURTHER HANDS UP I DO SEE ANOTHER HAND UP THE SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IT'S A PLEASURE TO JOIN YOU TODAY 'M ALTHOUGH I'M NOT VOTING TODAY ON THE- MEASURES I DID WANT TO MAKE JUST A QUICK COMMENT ON THIS ONE. AND SHARES SOME I THINK YOU NEED SENATE HISTORY. WITH ALL OF US AFTER I GOT ELECTED TO THE SENATE I KEPT WONDERING. WHAT IS THAT BUST OVER ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CHAMBERS. AND SO BEING PRESERVED I AM I DID SOME RESEARCH AND THAT'S DAVID BRODERICK ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S FIRST US SENATORS. AND THE REASON WE HAVE HIS BUSTS HERE- AND IN KNOWLEDGE IN HIS HISTORY IS HE WAS A AN ANTI SLAVERY DEMOCRATS WHEN HE WAS IN A POLITICAL OFFICE I HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN WHEN HE SERVED AS THE U. S. SENATOR IN WASHINGTON DC HE WAS VERY PASSIONATE. THATCALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE A SLAVE STATE AND IT COST HIM HIS LIFE HE GOT INTO A DAHLE WEATHER AND ANOTHER. DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUE FRIEND OF HIS AT FROM A CONVENTION THEY GOT INTO A DISAGREEMENT- ONE CHALLENGED OTHER TWO ADULT THEY HAD TO ACTUALLY LEAVE THE CITY LIMITS BECAUSE AT THE TIME BILLS ARE ILLEGAL IN THE- CITY OF SACRAMENTO BUT LEGAL IN THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO. UNFORTUNATELY ON THE DAY OF THE DUAL- DAVID- WAS THE LOSER OF THAT COMPETITION BUT I CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE WINNER OF HIS PASSION AND- THE HISTORY THAT HE HELPED. CALIFORNIA START WITH AND THE HISTORY THAT I THINK ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE TRYING TO LIVE UP TO. AND SO- WELL I CAN'T TAKE A POSITION ON THE BILL TODAY I JUST WANT TO SHOW THAT LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY WITH US AND SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE A POSITIVE. A RECOLLECTION OF SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA HISTORY WHEN IT CAME TO DEALING WITH SLAVERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM PRESIDENT THANK. YOU SENATOR JONES SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK MA'AM PRESS ARRIVE IN STRONG. OF THIS AND I WISH SHE WAS STRONGER I WISH WAS IN THE STUDY I WISH IT WAS TIME FOR. NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT AMERICA TO PAY ITS DEBT TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN. PEOPLE OF THIS NATION. ARE JUST FIFTY SEVEN YEARS AGO YESTERDAY. DR KING SO ELOQUENTLY STATED. BAKER WROTE A PROMISSORY NOTE. TO THE AFRICAN AMERICANS AT THE END OF SLAVERY. A NOTE THAT HIS COMEBACK INSUFFICIENT FUNDS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FARMING EARLIER IF. AFTER AMERICANS STILL HIT THE LAND THAT THEY HEAR AFTER SLAVERY WE WILL ALL BE BILLIONAIRES IF THE FORTY ACRES AND A MULE THAT WAS PROMISED TO FREE SLAVES WERE DELIVERED TO THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE FLAVORS TODAY WE WILL ALL BE BILLIONAIRES BUT IT HASN'T HAPPENED. THE OLD DAD AND I HERE FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE SAY WELL I DIDN'T OWN SLAVES THAT WAS SO LONG AGO WELL YOU CAN INHERIT WEALTH YOU CAN IN HERE TODAY BUT YOU'LL HAVE BEEN AMERICAN SO I HOPE THIS GOALS FOR THIS STUDY SHOULD BE ABOUT PARTISANSHIP IT SHOULD BE A BALL WRITES. RESPECT IN OBLIGATION DIRECTORY OF THE SKY. AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS COUNTRY STANDS TODAY. BECAUSE OF THE SPREE SLAVE LABOR ATKINS WHO WERE BROUGHT HERE AGAINST THEIR WILL AND WE'RE THE GREAT COUNTRY WE ARE TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT SLAVE LABOR AND I THINK IT'S FAR PAST TIME FOR AMERICA TO PAY THAT DEBT GOOD AFTERNOON MARK PEOPLE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD SENIOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATE MITCHELL PLEASE CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I THANK YOU ALL FOR. YOUR DEBATE AND INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC I WOULD JUST SAY. A COUPLE THINGS- HAVING SERVED FROM. THE A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME AS A SITTING MEMBER OF THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE. I WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER- COMMISSION OR BOARD THAT- REQUIRES THE MINORITY PARTY TO HAVE A ROLE IN AS AN APPOINTED AUTHORITY- SO THIS WOULD BE UNIQUE THAT DOESN'T EXIST FOR IN ANY OTHER COMMISSIONER BOARD. SECONDLY I THINK IF YOU REVIEW THE APPOINTMENTS MADE BY THIS ADMINISTRATION THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION- ITS IT'S VERY. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT ARE SITTING GOVERNOR OR SITTING PROTEIN OR SPEAKER- ARE NOT BROAD AND OPEN IN THEIR APPOINTMENTS AND SOME REPUBLICANS HAVE TO BEEN APPOINTED. BUT AGAIN THERE IS NO EXAMPLE I COULD FIND WHERE THE MINORITY PARTY HAS APPOINTING AUTHORITY AND SO ON WE DID NOT BELIEVE IT WAS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE FOR THIS BILL- FOR ALL THE REASONS REFERENCED PREVIOUSLY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
