ENERGY UTILITIES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. I THINK IS OUR FINAL COMMITTEE HEARING OF THE EAR. OUR FINAL SCHEDULED. SCHEDULED A HEARING OF THE EAR. THAT IS ON THIS YEAR'S CALENDAR SO WE WILL SEE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATOR SCIENCES -- ASSEMBLY BILL TEN TWENTY SIX I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT IN THE ANALYSIS. REGARDING CORPORATION APPROPRIATE TRIGGER FOR THE EIGHTEEN MONTH CLOCK TO BEGIN THAT ADDRESSES THE VERY APPROACHED APPROACHES OF EACH UTILITY. CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUING TO SUFFERS FROM THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE'S HISTORY IF WE ARE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE RATE AT WHICH NEW DWELLINGS ARE CONSTRUCTED. AND REDUCE THE COMMA ACOSTA CONSTRUCTION WE NEED TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE COSTLY AVOIDABLE THE DELAYS. FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS STATE LAWS REQUIRED BUILDERS TO COMPLY WITH FIRE AND SAFETY BUILDING STANDARDS THAT ARE IN EFFECT ON THE DATE THE APPLICATION FOR A BUILDING PERMIT IS SUBMITTED TO A LOCAL BUILDING DEPARTMENT. AB TEN TWENTY SIX MERELY SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THE SAME LEVEL OF CLARITY IN THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY LINE EXTENSIONS. AS AS WELL AS THAT WHICH CURRENTLY EXISTS FOR THE FIRE IN LIFE -- LIFE SAFETY BUILDING STANDARDS THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ONCE AN ELECTRIC OR GAS CORPORATION APPROVES THE CONSTRUCTION DESIGN AND SPECIFICATIONS. THEY HAVE DETERMINED THE RULES TO GO TO WHICH THE CONSTRUCTION MUST COMPLY. HERE TESTIFIED SUPPORT ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS RAW ROB ROB RHYMER OF WITH C. B. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BOURZAT BOB BREMER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL UTILITIES -- UNLIKE A BUILDING STANDARDS AND LOCAL BUILDING DEPARTMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION OF UTILITY LINE EXTENSION RULES OF FOR EACH OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. OF WHAT WE'RE SEEKING HERE IS TO TRY TO FIND SOME A GENERIC LANGUAGE THAT -- BASICALLY ADDRESSES EVERYBODY'S ISSUES -- VERY QUICK SOLUTION OFFER SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC WOULD POSSIBLY BE TO HAVE A A SEPARATE PARAGRAPH REFERENCING THERE'S WE SEEM TO HAVE AGREEMENT AMONGST THE OTHERS WERE FINE WITH THAT. SO WITH THAT THAT'S MY DESTINY. VERY WELL ANYBODY ELSE -- SPEAKING IN FAVOR. DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] MEMBERS. THANK YOU RICHARD DISABILITIES VERY LOGICAL SO -- I WILL BE OPPOSED [inaudible] BOB. BILL WHEN THE TIME IS IT WHEN THE TIME IS GONNA COME WE HAVE AN A A QUORUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS DISTURB RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BUT WHEN THE TIME COMES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH GONZALEZ [inaudible] A CERTAIN. WHEN I WAS THE CHIEF OVERCOME THEM I CALLED A FEW MINUTES AGO? WE NEED AT ALL. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] IT [inaudible] WILL. HEY GOOD MORNING THIS IS THE SERGEANTS AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ABLE TO COME OVER THEN WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFER OKAY [inaudible] OKAY IF YOU COULD JOIN. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. CARA MEMBERS. GOOD MORNING TO TURN MEMBERS. AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THAT WILL ASSIST IN PROVIDING DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF HOMES DESTROYED BY WILDFIRE. NUMEROUS FIRE SAFETY EXPERTS AND ADVOCATES FOR NON COMBUSTIBLES OWNED WITHIN FIVE FEET SORRY ADVOCATED FOR THE NON COMBUSTIBLE SO WITHIN FIVE FEET OF A STRUCTURE. AS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROTECT STRUCTURES SUCH AS YOU THE UC DIVISION OF AGRICULTURAL NATURAL RESOURCES. A FORMER STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION. AB FIFTEEN SIXTY MORE PHASE AND A NON COMBUSTIBLES ON ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARN FROM THE MOST RECENT FIRES WAS THAT. HAVING NON COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL% RIGHT AROUND THE STRUCTURE RIGHT AROUND THE PERIMETER STRUCTURE. IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS TEND TO KEEP CLEAR -- THERE WERE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES WHERE ENTIRE LANDSCAPES DIDN'T BURN NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE TREES. THE GRASS WAS INTACT BUT BECAUSE SOMEONE HAD A PILE OF WOOD RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR HOUSE FOR INSTANCE OR THEY HAD VINES PLANTS ALL OVER. THERE BUILDING. ONE NUMBER. HIT THAT COMBUSTIBLE AREA AND WILL CAUSE THE LOSS OF THE STRUCTURE SO WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S IMPORTANT IS SET UP THIS NEW ONE TO ZERO TO FIVE FEET NOT COMBUSTIBLES ON WILL STILL DETERMINE KIND OF WHAT WE THINK. CAN BE PLANTED IN THAT AREA AND WHAT COULDN'T BUT IT'LL GIVE HOMEOWNERS A LOT MORE DIRECTION AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THAT AREA CLEAR OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL TO THOSE PROPERTIES AT BURNED A LOT OF THEM THOSE HOUSES. IT WASN'T A WALL OF FIRE THAT TOOK THEM DOWN IT WAS NOT HAVING THAT BEARD A FIVE FOOT NON COMBUSTIBLE SOON SO THIS WILL GIVE GUIDANCE TO PROPERTY OWNERS AND ALSO TO INSPECTORS -- TO HELP WITH THAT -- AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WILL ALSO REQUIRE CAL FIRE TO MEET ITS GOAL OF INSPECTING EVERY KNOWN STRUCTURE ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS. EVEN FLLOWING IN THE PRESS HAS BEEN A LOT OF REPORTS ABOUT HOW FEW OF THESE STRUCTURES AND HIGH HAZARD ZONES ARE CURRENTLY BEING INSPECTED. AND ONE OUT OF COMPLIANCE HOUSE CAN PUT AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD AT RISK SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET PEOPLE OUT IN THE FIELD TO INSPECT. TO NOTIFY HOMEOWNERS WHEN THEY HAVE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS AND WE CAN'T ASSUME THAT HOMEOWNERS NOW I'M A HOMEOWNER AND A HIGH HAZARD ZONE AND UNTIL IT SORT OF DOING THIS WORK I HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD DANGEROUS CONDITIONS ON MY OWN PROPERTY. ACCORDING TO A NEW KQED INVESTIGATION ONLY 70% OF PROPERTIES IN THE TERRITORY WERE CAL FIRE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING DEFENSIBLE SPACE WERE ACTUALLY CHECKED BY THEIR INSPECTORS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WILL REQUIRE THE USE OF RIGHT TREE RIGHT PLACE FOR FUTURE PLANTING UNDER ELECTRICAL LINES AND HIGH FIRED. HAZARD AREAS THIS WILL REDUCE UTILITY BUDGET SAY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COSTA WILDFIRES THIS INCLUDES REQUIRING CAL FIRE TO DEVELOP A GUIDE BOOK TO PROVIDE LANDOWNERS I'M OPTIONS OF VEGETATION. THAT WILL NEVER GROW GROW INTO ENERGIZED CONDUCTORS AND CAUSE FIRES. THE UTILITY ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN NARROWED TO JUST A PILOT IN SDG ANY TERRITORY. AND WILL BE EVALUATED IN THEIR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. AND THE OTHER SERVICE TERRITORIES UTILITIES CAN STILL DO OUT REGION EDUCATION UNDER THE LAW AND LOCALS AND CAL FIRE CAN STILL IN FORCE IT. AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I SUPPORT CLARIFYING THAT THE GUY WILL WILL BE DEVELOPED AS A PUBLIC PROCESS. AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THE SIERRA CLUB -- THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I INDUSTRY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND S. T. G. ANY. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MICHAEL DELEO SYSTEM FORRESTER FOR SDG ANY I'M BOB ROEMER. SENIOR ENGINEER FOR THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF CENTERS ON BOB ROEMER -- WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO DO A ME TOO FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. THE FIRE HARDING BUILDING STANDARDS -- WHICH WE PUT TOGETHER BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ARE INCREDIBLY AND EFFECTIVE -- BUT THAT EFFECTIVENESS DROP SIGNIFICANTLY THEN THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS NOT MAINTAINED AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IS ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. IT ALSO DIRECTS CALIFORNIA STATE FARM MARSHALL A TO DEVELOP RULES FOR THE NON COMBUSTIBLE ZONE WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THIS IS A FIVE FOOT PERIMETER. AROUND THE STRUCTURE ITSELF AND THIS IS EASILY ACCOMPLISHED ODD ALSO PROHIBITS THE PLANTING OF TREES UNDER POWER LINES AT WILL WHEN THEY MATURE -- COME IN CONTACT WITH THOSE POWER LINES I REALIZE THAT MAY SEEM OBVIOUS BUT IT IT HAPPENS QUITE REGULARLY OUT THERE. LASTLY THE BILL DIRECTS CAL FIRE AND A HOST OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS A TO DEVELOP A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL. THIS CONCEPT IS SOMEONE AND NOW JUST TO THE HOME ENERGY RATING TOOL THAT'S ALREADY OUT THERE AND WILL BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL -- IN HELPING US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MITIGATE FAR RISK IN BOTH NEW AND ESPECIALLY EXISTING DEVELOPMENTS. LASTLY AB FIFTEEN SIXTEENS VERY COMPLEMENT OR DO A HOST OF OTHER BILLS -- ICLUDING SENATOR -- DODDS -- SP -- ONE NINETY THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION BILL THAT'S OUT THERE SO WITH THAT AS MUCH AS ANY QUESTIONS -- MORE MATURE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHAEL DELAY ON THE SYSTEM FORSTER FOR SENEGAL GAS ELECTRIC UP AN EMPLOYEE. FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I MAY ASSIST HER FRONT ARBORIST AND UTILITIES SPECIALIST -- I WILL BRIEFLY SPEECH ABOUT TODAY ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF RIGHT TO REPLACE ITS BENEFITS AND HOW THIS MEASURE WILL HELP. CALIFORNIANS WE ALL ARE LIVE IN THE NEW NORM OF EXTREME WILDFIRE RISK AND WE ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY WITH THAT -- NOT ONLY THE UTILITIES BUT ALSO LOCAL AGENCIES -- STATE AGENCIES AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS SO ONE VERY HELPFUL THING THAT CUSTOMERS CAN DO WHEN THEY'RE CONSIDERING TREES TO PLAN A LANDSCAPE. IS THE APPROPRIATE TREES RELATIVE TO POWER LINES SO THIS MEASURE WILL DEVELOP OF GUIDE BOOK THAT WILL HELP ASSIST CUSTOMERS AND MAKING THOSE CHOICES -- THIS POLICIES CALLED THE RIGHT TO REPLACE THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A UNIQUE CONCEPT TO SD GINNY. IS A A CONCEPT IN A POLICY THAT'S FOLLOWED BY ALL THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND A D. THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND INTERNATIONAL. SB GINNY CURRENTLY ENCOURAGES CUSTOMERS TO FOLLOW THIS CONCEPT OF RIGHT TREE RIGHT PLACE THROUGH ONE ONE CONTACT. THROUGH OUR CONTRACTORS AND INTERNALLY. AND ALSO THROUGH OUR WEBSITE AND THROUGH COLLATERAL LIKE HANDLES. SO PLANNING DIRECTOR IN OUR PLACE IS -- PROVIDES MANY MANY BENEFITS ONCE BRIEFLY GO OVER THOSE INCREASES WORKER SAFETY AND PUBLIC SAFETY -- BY NOT HAVING SOMEONE IN THE TREE PRUNING TREES NEAR POWER LINES. IT ALLOWS THE TREES TO REACH THEIR FULL MATURE HEIGHT AND ALL THE ANCILLARY BENEFITS. CARBON SEQUESTRATION OXYGEN RELEASE SHADE AND ALSO -- THE JUST THE BEAUTY OF THE TREES ARE THE AESTHETICS SKEWS ME. THE PRESERVES THE HEALTH OF THE TREE BY ELIMINATING UNNECESSARY PRUNING IT REDUCES THE FUEL CAPACITY IF THERE'S A FIRE. IT ALSO REDUCES REPAIRS EXPENSE PLAN NECESSARY TRIMMING. TWENTY SIXTEEN WOULD CREATE THIS RIGHT TREE RIGHT PLACE GUIDEBOOK AGAIN. GIVE CUSTOMERS GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DO THE TRIMMING OF THE PROPER TREES TO PLAN YOUR POWER LINES THERE ALSO WOULD ESTABLISH A STATE WHAT POLICY. THAT CUSTOMERS WOULD NEED TO FOLLOW JUST TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE REDUCING THE CHANCE OF FIRE WERE FROM WHENEVER POSSIBLE. FOLLOWING RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT PLACE GUIDELINES IS VERY POSITIVE PROACTIVE ACTIVITY. THE PRIVATE LANDOWNER CAN ENGAGE IN TO ASSIST WITH MEDICAID WILDFIRE RISK. MESSAGING USING COMPLETE SUPPORT OF ESTABLISHING THIS NEW STATE POLICY THROUGH A. B.. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU -- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE -- JULIE ALLEN OWSKI BALL IN THE HALF OF THE MID PENINSULA REGIONAL OPEN SPACE DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS YOU SO ELEVEN SALAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AS NOTED BY THE AUTHOR WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE THINK HER FOR HER ONGOING WORK ON THIS CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS KAREN MILLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION JUST HERE TODAY TO CLARIFY THAT ALL THE WAY IT ADDED -- OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL THAT WERE NEUTRAL NOW AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS WORKING WITH THIS TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENT CATEGORY THAT WELL MAINTAINED ORCHARDS. FALL INTO IN CONSIDERING FIRE SAFETY AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING THE GUIDE BOOK IN A PUBLIC PROCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU. TO HAVE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER I WANT TO THANK SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. FOR SETTING THE TONE. SETTING THE MODEL I WANT TO THANK YOU. MISTER VALLEJO -- I'M JUST CURIOUS ARE RE GOING TO ASSUME THAT CAL FIRE AND THE CPUC YOU'RE GONNA. FINISH YOUR KEEP UP TO DATE THE FIRE MAPS. SO I I'VE I THINK THE FOR THE FARM MAPS WERE DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION. WITH -- THE DEVELOPING A VHF TV ARE CERTAINLY THE MOST LATEST AND I THINK UP TO DATE. THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A SPECIFIC METRICS THAT WERE USED TO DEVELOP A STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. THAT IS LOOKING AT FIRE HISTORY -- FUELS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE AND THE PROPENSITY OF VEGETATION TO BURN SO YES I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT. THAT MEASURE WILL CONTINUE -- WE HAVE OUR OWN SPECIFIC NEUROLOGISTS AND AND FAR CORNERS ON STAFF IT ACTUALLY HELPED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOST LATEST. FIRE BOUNDARIES AS IT PERTAINS TO THE HEART OUR THIRD DISTRICT WHICH THE CPC ADOPTED. MY AS OF BEFORE THE TWO MAJOR FIRES THEY DIDN'T WORKING FOR EIGHT YEARS AND HAD NOT COMPLETED THEM SO WAS. REALLY FRUSTRATING SO. I'M JUST HOPING CEBU SEEING CAL FIRE CAN BE HELPFUL. IN THIS FIRE HAZARDS SEVERITY ZONE -- IT WOULD MOVE WE HAVE TEARS IS IS THIS A UNIQUE. TOP TIER OR IS IT. NORMAL NOMENCLATURE SO THE SO THE APPLICABILITY OF AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WOULD BE. FOR THE STATE HIGH FIRE THREAD DISTRICTS WHICH WAS A DETERMINED BY CPC IN CONJUNCTION WITH CAL FIRE IN THE FIRE EXPERTS. AND THIS THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA WHICH SHOWS FOR DICTATES THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE THAT CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSIBLE FOR IF YOU WOULD LOOK AT A MAP. THOSE TERRITORIES ESSENTIALLY OVERLAY AND EIGHT THE SHARE ALMOST COMPLETE -- A BOUNDARY OF COMMONALITY BOUNDARY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME PORTIONS OF THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE H. OF TV. AND WE WE WOULD HAVE A CONCERN THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE STATE RESPONSE VERY BECAUSE THERE ARE. PORTIONS OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY THEY JUST HAVE THE THE DEFINITION OF A STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA BUT ARE EXTREMELY HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS AND WHAT COMES TO MIND TO ME IS. A RANCHO SANTA FE WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST -- A DENSELY EUCALYPTUS GROVE ENCLAVES AND SEND YOU A SAN DIEGO -- AND IT'S SOME OF THE HIGHEST PROPERTY VALUE IN OUR COUNTY SO WE WOULD ENDORSE RETAINING THE HF TV AND THE US ARE A WITHIN THIS BILL. YET YES SENATOR AL IN RESPONSE DIRECTLY TO YOUR QUESTION -- SB. ONE EIGHTY TWO DIRECTS THE FIRE MARSHAL CALIFORNIA UPDATE THE MAPS. ANA END -- THERE ALREADY IS ALREADY THE AUTHORITY FOR A LOCAL JURISDICTION TO APPLY A MORE RIGOROUS STANDARDS -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CLIMATIC GEOLOGICAL TOPOGRAPHIC FIRE SAFETY IS ONE THE MOST COMMON LOCAL MODIFICATIONS -- TO CITY CODE. THERE WAS SB ONE EIGHTY ONE SB ONE EIGHTY TWO JACKSON. A LOOK OF THAT -- RANCHO SANTA FE -- WE REALIZE THAT EUCALYPTUS TREES DON'T MAKE GOOD RAILROAD TIES [inaudible] BUT I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT A NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE THAT BUT I'M CONSIDER ABOUT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT MIGHT BE. LOWER IN THE ECONOMIC -- CYCLE OF THE CIRCUITRY OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW. THE GRASS AND THEY WOULD SAY WAIT A SECOND CAN YOU CHANGE OUR RATING. BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE THESE CHANGES IT. IS THAT IS OUR POTENTIAL THERE FOR SOMEONE SO. WE CAN AFFORD TO BE IN THIS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE IS OUR OR OR IS THIS IS JUST COMPLETELY SET BY THE CPUC AND AND CAL FIRE. NOT NOT REALLY -- AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF THE RISK ANALYSIS TOOL THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SORT OF A ONE DIMENSIONAL Là MAP IT SAYS YOU'RE IN A GOOD PLACE OR BAD PLACE -- THE RISK ANALYSIS TOOL TAKES THAT SORT OF INTO A THREE DIMENSIONAL THRESHOLD WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE FIRE HARDING OF THE BUILDING THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THEN LOOK AT JURISDICTION LAWYERS ISSUES. OF FIRE RESOURCE -- PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT -- BASICALLY -- IT WILL FINALLY BE A TOOL WHERE INSURANCE AND AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS VARIETY REASON AND THE HOMEOWNERS CAN BASICALLY COME AND USE THAT TOOL AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCREASE THE FIRE PROTECTION OF THE DWELLING. FOR THE LEAST COST THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IS OW THIS TOOLS CAN WORK GREAT. THANK YOU FOR LET ME FLEX SOME OF THIS OUT BUT YOU REALLY THINK THE CPUC IS GOING TO GET. THAT HANDBOOK OUT IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IT. I'M SORRY BUT I CYNICAL BUT I I I I UNDERSTAND THAT -- IN THE SECTOR IS THE LOCAL FIRE SERVICE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THIS WHICH MEANS LOCAL CITIES -- COUNCILS AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS AS WELL. AND SO -- I I THINK WITH THE INDUSTRY'S INPUT -- EVERYBODY'S HAPPILY LOOKING AT AT MOVING THIS INTO PLACES BROAD SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND SO I I THINK WITH THAT IN MIND THAT THE PC IS PROBABLY GOING TO RUN INTO VERY LITTLE. OPPOSITION TO DO SOMETHING WHICH QUITE FRANKLY SO OBVIOUS AND WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO ASK YOU HAVE CAL FIRE COME BACK TO US IN A FEW MONTHS AND WE NEED MORE STAFF. I'M JUST WONDERING CAN CAL FIRE. CONTRACT OUT THIS REVIEW SAID HAVE YET YES ALL PLEDGE FIREFIGHTER. I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP IN THE ANSWER IS YES -- RIGHT NOW THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THERE'S A SYSTEM OF FIRE SAFE COUNCILS THROUGH I'M THERE'S DOZENS AND DOZENS OF THESE THROUGHOUT THE STATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ALREADY MAKING GOOD USE AND INDEED THE STATE CAN CONTRACT OUT AND DOES -- WITH THESE LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCILS. I WILL ADD THAT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE MONEY. IN THE BUDGET AS A AS THE GOVERNOR PRIORITIZES WILDFIRE ACROSS THE STATE -- PUTTING MONEY INTO THESE AREAS INTO THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND ALL OF THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS IS ESSENTIAL SO WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE. MORE RESOURCES AGO TOWARDS THIS WORK RIGHT I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE HIGH POWERED FIREFIGHTERS YOU KNOW. DOING NEIGHBORHOOD YEAH YEAH NOW THAT THIS IN BACKYARD REVIEWS AND SO THERE'S OTHER GROUPS THAT CAN HANDLE THANK YOU MISTER ROEMER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'LL MOVE THE BILL. WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WANT TO MAKE IT. JUST I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU [inaudible] THE ROOM. I'M SO SORRY [inaudible] YEAH HOW DID I MISS YOU?

JANUARY TWENTY NINTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FILING FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY. LAST SESSION IN COLLABORATION WITH MEMBERS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SB NINE A ONE SENATOR DODD'S BILL ENTITLED THE WILDFIRE PROTECTION ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. SB NINE OH ONE SET INTO MOTION A SERIES OF CRITICAL ACTIONS THAT ARE THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION. HAS BEEN MANDATED TO UNDERTAKE INCLUDING OVERSEEING THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. NOT LONG AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THAT MEASURE DEVASTATING AND DEADLY FIRE CONSUME THE TOWN OF PARADISE. AND OTHER NEARBY COMMUNITIES LEAVING A PATH OF DESTRUCTION AND DEATH. CALIFORNIA HAS NOW CONFIRMED THAT THE CAP WAS IN FACT CAUSED BY ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION LINES OWNED AND OPERATED BY PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY HAS CAUSED UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE FUTURE. OF THE UTILITY AND IMPORTANTLY THE ABILITY OF WHILE FOR SURVIVORS AND THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO LOST LOVED ONES. TO RECEIVE THEIR JUST RECOMMENDS. EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES WHO ARE FINANCIALLY RELIED UPON THE STABILITY OF A UTILITY OF HAD. THAT REALITY SHATTERED. CONTRACTS FOR RENEWABLES THAT ARE ENABLING CALIFORNIA TO REACH OUR CLIMATE GOALS ARE THREATENED. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS FOR PGA A REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE FINALIZED BY THE COURT. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA RELY UPON THE CPUC TO REPRESENT OUR BEST INTERESTS AND REGULATORY REFORMS AND NOW IN THIS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. ACR SEVENTY EIGHT CALLS UPON THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND FILINGS WITH THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT. TO ENSURE THAT SURVIVORS AND RATE PAYERS ARE TREATED FAIRLY.

WIENER AYE [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] CASE [inaudible] NUMBER. I PROMISE I WON'T PLANET VIDEO GAMES WITH [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] YEAH THE MORNING AS CHAIR NAP SENATORS. HERE TO PRESENT AB. FIFTY SIX WE FIFTIES THE FIFTY SIX ON THE CURRENT LAW. PC HOLDS IT ALREADY TO ORDER BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING BY THE I USE ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. AB FIFTY SIX SIMPLY ALLOWS A PC TO RELY ON PUBLIC ENTITY TO SERVE AS A BACKSTOP. INSTEAD OF THE I. O. USE. THIS PUBLIC ENTITY WOULD FUNCTION JUST LIKE OTHER UTILITIES AND WILL PROVIDE A STABLE TRANSPARENT BACKSTOP FOR PROCUREMENT. IN TIMES OF NEED. A STATE ENTITY WILL PROTECT RATE PAYERS WHILE ALSO ENSURING WE STAY ON TRACK WITH OUR POOR RELIABILITY STANDARDS AND CLIMATE GOALS. WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT THIS IS AN ANTI CC A BILL. THAT WILL ELIMINATE THEIR ABILITY TO SELF PARK HERE. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT. A VALID WHAT THE BILL IS -- WRITTEN TO DO. IN FACT THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO EXPAND CURRENT PC OF FORTY TO DIRECT A PROCUREMENT AND DOES NOT CHANGE THE CURRENT RIGHTS CCA'S HAVE. THE SELF PROCURE. AND NOT PASSING THIS BILL TODAY I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR -- MEANS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE USING THE I USE AS A BACKSTOP ENTITIES SOMETHING THAT MANY RATE PAYERS ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONSUMER CHOICE ADVOCATES WOULD ALSO OPPOSE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CONCEPT BEHIND THIS BILL FOR ALMOST A YEAR. AS THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE REPORT CONCLUDES THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIVAL RIGHT. NICE CAMPAIGN. I MEAN YOU COREGONUS PRODUCTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT AS A ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY POLICY IS CURRENTLY AT A CROSSROADS WITH THE RISE A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION AND INCREASES IN DIRECT ACCESS. THIS IS GOING TO MEAN A SMALLER ROLE FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES GOING FORWARD BUT EXISTING LAW PLACES THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE ROLE OF CONDUCTING FAX STOP PROCUREMENT. FOR BOTH RELIABILITY AND RESOURCE PLANNING PURPOSES UNDER EXISTING LAW THE P. YOU SEE CAN DIRECT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO FILL DEFICITS UNDER THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAMS. AND TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS. ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM FOR THAT PROCUREMENT INCLUDING THOSE SERVE BY CCA'S AND DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS. ON THE NEED FOR ACTION TODAY ON LET ON BACKSTOPS CHAIRMAN IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL OR SPECULATIVE. THE P. YOU SEE HAS RECENTLY BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT THE BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT MECHANISM AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS PART OF SB THREE FIFTY THAT APPLIES TO THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAM. I'M ABSENT THE TOOLS PROVIDED IN AB FIFTY SIX THE E. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WILL BE THE ONLY UTILITIES THE ONLY ENTITIES. THAT CAN BE DIRECTED TO PERFORM THESE BACKSTOPS FUNCTIONS. BUT THE I'LL USE ARE FACING CREDIT CHALLENGES AS EVERYONE HERE KNOWS ALL TOO WELL AND SOMEONE TO GET OUT OF PROCUREMENT ENTIRELY. OTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES SUCH AS THE CCA'S HAVE STRONGLY OPPOSED EFFORTS TO SIGN ANY BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT TO THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. THE NEED FOR COORDINATED RESOURCE AND RELIABILITY PLANNING IS GREATER THAN EVER AND THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN STATE OVERSIGHT AND HAVE A RATIONAL STRATEGY COULD SET THE STAGE FOR THE NEXT ENERGY CRISIS. IN RESPONSE AB FIFTY SIX WOULD CREATE A PUBLIC STATE JURISDICTIONAL BACKSTOP THEY CAN BE USED TO ASSIST IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF KEY POLICY OBJECTIVES. SPECIFICALLY THE MECHANICS OF AB FIFTY SIX WOULD AUTHORIZE THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY TO SERVE AS THE BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT IT FOR SPECIFIC RELIABILITY AND RESOURCE PLANNING PURPOSES. ALREADY DEFINED IN EXISTING LAW. IT ALLOWS KATE FOR THE SANITY TO SERVE AS A VOLUNTARY PROCUREMENT ENTITY UNDER THE OUR PS PROGRAM WHICH OPERATIONALIZE IS ANOTHER BACKSTOP MECHANISM ALREADY IN CURRENT LONG. VICE FOR PC OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCUREMENT ADVANCED DIRECTION AFTER THE FACT APPROVING OF CONTRACTS AND FAIR COST RECOVERY FROM CUSTOMERS. ON AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA HAS POINTED OUT THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS APPROACH IN THE GOVERNOR'S OWN STRIKE FORCE REPORT IN THE P. UC'S OWN GREEN BOOK REPORT WHICH IT PUBLISHED LAST YEAR. IDENTIFYING GAPS ASSOCIATED WITH EMERGING COMPETITIVE MARKETS -- AND ABSENT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A ROBUST STATE BACKSTOPS THE CALIFORNIA I SO MAY BE REQUIRED TO INTERVENE MORE FORCEFULLY IN CALIFORNIA'S MARKETS. THERE BY GETTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MORE INVOLVED IN CALIFORNIA'S RELIABILITY AND RESOURCE PLANNING POLICIES. ON I WANT TO ALSO JUST EXPLAIN WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO. THE BILL DOES NOT MODIFY THE RULES PRACTICES OR REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXISTING RESOURCE ADEQUACY INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING OR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAMS. IT DOES NOT TRANSFER ALL RESPONSIBILITIES WITH CENTRAL BUYER ONLY RESIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES. AND IT DOES NOT CREATE A NEW STATE AGENCY THAT IS VESTED WITH ITS OWN POLICY MAKING POWER. THE IDEA HERE IS TO CREATE A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED BY THE PC TO PERFORM THIS BACKSTOPS IN LIEU OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. IT ALSO DOES NOT HARM RETAIL COMPETITION OR COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION. THE BILL STATES EXPLICITLY THAT CCA'S AND YES PLEASE REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCURING TO MEET 1100% OF THEIR CUSTOMER LOADS. AND THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS. REINFORCE THIS PRINCIPLE BY PROVIDING EXPLICIT RIGHTS FOR CCA'S TO PROVIDE ANY PORTION OF IDENTIFIED NEEDS PURSUANT TO THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS. GOVERNING THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAMS. ON WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION NOW. WE'RE URGING THE COMMITTEE AND THIS LEGISLATURE NOT TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT ENERGY CRISIS ARRIVES WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT UNTIL OR IS A BONA FIDE EMERGENCY TO DEVELOP THE MECHANISMS NEEDED TO STABILIZE ELECTRICITY MARKETS. FOR THOSE WHO WERE HERE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT THERE LEGISLATURE WAS FORCED TO AUTHORIZE STATE INTERVENTION. ONLY AFTER WHOLESALE MARKETS HAD MELTED DOWN WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER EMERGENCY FOR THE STATE TO ACT THE GOAL IS TO BE AHEAD OF THE CURVE. AND MAKE SURE THE STATE HAS ALL THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS ANY DEFICITS ARE GAPS THAT EMERGE AS PART OF THE STATE'S ENERGY POLICY PROCESS. THANK YOU WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND ASK FOR SUPPORTING ABOUT THANK YOU. THE ONE SPEAK YES I AM GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATIE BALANCE WHILE I'M WITH THAT CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BELL AND APOLOGIES FOR NOT GETTING THE LETTER. IN TIME TO BE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS THEY HOW IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF COMMUNITY CHOICE AND COMMUNITY BASED ENERGY PROJECTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT CHANGING THE WAY CCA'S DO BUSINESS TODAY NOR IS THIS ABOUT CHANGING THE WAY BACK THOUGHT PROCUREMENT AS IDENTIFIED. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY ABOUT WHO DOES BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT IN THE CASE A NEED IS IDENTIFIED AND IN THIS CASE WE BELIEVE THAT MOVIE NOT AWAY FROM I USED TO A STATE ENTITY. IS A VERY STRONG POLICY MOVE AND WE SUPPORT THAT. HAVING A BACKSTOP ENERGY IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING WE WE BOTH MAINTAIN RELIABILITY AND ACHIEVE OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR FOR BRINGING FOR THIS REALLY TIMELY ABOUT. WE ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDERWAY SINCE FEBRUARY ON THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORED ACCEPTED ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE OFFERED TO DATE AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING OUT. SOME OF THE TECHNICAL CHANGES THAT ARE IN THE BILL AND WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO MOVE THIS FOR TODAY THANK YOU. HI -- GOOD MORNING LORD AS HE MENACE WITH SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- REALLY AGREE WITH -- MATT AND KATIE'S POINTS OUT WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL WE FEEL THAT THE FRAGMENTATION. OF OF THE ENERGY INDUSTRY REQUIRES REALLY A BILL LIKE THIS AND HAVING YOU ALL ON THE FOREFRONT TO HELP US COORDINATE -- THE CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT -- WE FEEL THAT -- AGAIN GIVEN THAT THE ENERGY SUPPLIES BECOMING INCREASINGLY DECENTRALIZED AND AS A STATE MOVE FOR MOVE SOARED WITH THE DECENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT. A KEY ISSUE FACING LEGISLATORS ARE REGULATORS AS COORDINATION OF THAT PROCUREMENT TO MEET SINGLE GOAL -- EITHER BE IT G. H. G. H. G. REDUCTION OR RELIABILITY AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD EXPLORING WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN -- IMPROVE RELIABILITY AND I RESOURCE ADEQUACY THE STATE. THANK YOU AND AND SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT YES THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. RUSSELL NOVAK ON BEHALF OF TE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE -- IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I DO WE HAVE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. AND IF WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM IN FRONT. FOR TWENTY MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEFF CIPHERS WITH CINEMA CLEAN POWER IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICES ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION AB -- FIFTY SIX WE BELIEVE THE BILL STARTED WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING GREATER RELIABILITY AND PROVIDING A MECHANISM POTENTIALLY FOR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO EXIT FROM PROCURING ENERGY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT MADE SENSE -- BUT SOMEHOW THE BILL VEERED INTO A VEHICLE TO REDEFINE BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT INSTEAD OF JUST IMPLEMENTING A CENTRAL BUYER TO DO IT. THE BILL SAYS THE BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT SHOULD NOW INCLUDE THE ADVANCE PURCHASE OF ENERGY UP TO TEN YEARS AHEAD OF ANY ACTUAL NEED AND THAT'S BECAUSE AB FIFTY SIX WOULD GIVE THE P. YOU SEE NEW POWER. TO ORDER A CENTRAL AGENCY TO BUY ENERGY FOR CCA'S ON THE BASIS OF A LONG RANGE PLANNING DOCUMENT CALLED AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN. NOT ON ANY ACTUAL SHORTFALL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY OR RELIABILITY BUT ON THE SPECULATION THAT THE CCA MIGHT NOT PURCHASE ENOUGH ENERGY YEARS BEFORE IT'S NEEDED. THIS ARRANGEMENT COULD MAKE SENSE IF IT WAS PART OF RESTRUCTURING P. GINNY. BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE TO TAKE AWAY PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT FROM CCA'S. TODAY THE P. YOU SEE AS THE POWER TO ORDER PROCUREMENT ONLY WANT TO SEE CA HAS FAILED TO MEET ITS COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS FILING AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN IS A COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION OF A CCA. BUT DISCLOSING A RISK FOR EXAMPLE THAT A WIND POWER PROJECT MIGHT NOT BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY TWENTY NINE IS NOT A COMPLAINTS VIOLATION IT'S A PLANNING TARGET. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT AND MAKE ANY RISK AT ALL OF THE FUTURE SHORTFALL A REASON FOR SO CALLED BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT. EVEN FOR RISKS IT CANNOT BE AVOIDED. KELSEY CA SUPPORTS A TRUE BACKSTOPS BILL THAT WOULD PROTECT GRADE RELIABILITY AND WE PROVIDED AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR THAT WOULD DO THAT BUT SO FAR THE AUTHOR HASN'T TAKEN ANY OF OUR AMENDMENTS. IN FACT CAL CC IS LEADING A BROAD STAKEHOLDER PROCESS MANY OF THOSE STAKEHOLDERS ARE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATE PROPOSAL TO CONCERNS ABOUT RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCUREMENT. WE ALREADY CONVINCED THE QC TO ADOPT A THREE YEAR MANDATE FOR PROCUREMENT OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY INSTEAD OF THE PREVIOUS ONE YEAR MANDATE. AND TO TAKE AWAY OUR ABILITY TO BUY CLEAN ENERGY RISKS THE VALUE OF COMMUNITY CHOICE PROGRAMS AND THE TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS WE PLANNED A BILL BY TWENTY THIRTY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOTEBOOK ANYONE ELSE. CAROL WE'D WITH THREE FIFTY BAY AREA ACTION A STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. CAN MEMBERS REBEKAH LEE ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WE HOP MUCH CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL WOULD BELIEVE ADDING ANOTHER STATE AUTHORITY TO THE ALPHABET SOUP OF EXISTING SIXTEEN STORY IS NOT GOING TO RESULT IN. MINIMIZE REPAIR IMPACT AND COST OF SO URGE THAT THIS CONVERSATION BE MOVED TO A TWO YEAR CONVERSATION WILL HAPPILY WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. AND THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT RACE BY THE SUPPORT COALITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. IN PRINT ON HOW ARE WE DO SEE A ROLE THAT THIS AGENCY COULD PLAY SPECIFICALLY -- ON DEFAULT A CONTRACT FOR THE RESULT OF BANKRUPTCY BUT OUTSIDE OF BEING SICK NEVER A TO THAT SCOPE WE DO OPPOSE. MR TERM MEMBERS ONLY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION THE LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CAUCUS. WE HAVE A A LETTER OF CONSIDERATION INTO COMMITTEE WE DO BELIEVE THIS CONVERSATION SHOULD CONTINUE BUT A TWO YEAR EFFORT WOULD BE EASIER AND BETTER FOR US. TO CONTEMPLATE ALL THE ISSUES AND QUESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED BY THE BILL WE THINK RIGHT NOW IT WEIGHS MORE QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE ANSWERS AND WE ASK FOR THE BILL TO BE HELD. THANK YOU. HENCE THE BAKER WITH THEIR NAY DISSOCIATES FOR SILICON VALLEY CLEAN ENERGY IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS CAL SINCE HE IS ALREADY REFERENCE. EMILY PAPPAS ON BEHALF OF M. C. E. ALSO IN OPPOSITION. ALICIA PRIEGO ON BEHALF OF STAND AS A CLEAN ENERGY IN OPPOSITION. THERE DAHLE HIM HAPPILY A CALIFORNIA CITIES JUST ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY KELSEY CA ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN OPPOSITION. MR MEMBERS VINCENT WERE OUT MUCH OF WHAT THE WYOMING ON BEHALF OF EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY ALSO IN OPPOSITION. NOT CLUB AND SEE NOW WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR IN STORE DISSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. LIKE IT IS HERE WE HAVE THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND OUR CONCERNS ALIGNED WITH KELSEY CA. BUT SHEPHERD ON BEHALF OF THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN OPPOSITION. KAREN MILLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MARK FENSTER MAKER FOR PENCIL CLEAN ENERGY AND VALLEY CLEAN ENERGY IN OPPOSITION. YOUR CHAIR MEMBERS DON GILBERT FOR SFPUC WE OPPOSE AND WANT. TO KNOW THE REFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS TO THE TREASURES LETTER INDICATING A MUCH CONCERNED WITH THIS AGENCY THAT WOULD BE CREATED THANKS. KAREN PERKINS AS A MEMBER OF THREE FIFTY BAY AREA OPPOSED. JOHNSON CLAIMED BY THE CITY EVEN SENATORS IN OPPOSITION. AUDREY RETIRED CHECK ON BEHALF OF THE SAN MATEO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN OPPOSITION. ELIZABETH HAS BEEN -- SOME BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALSO OPPOSED -- MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN OPPOSITION. OKAY ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION OR TWO WINNERS OR ANYBODY ELSE IN THE PUBLIC WHICH TO COMMENT ON THIS. OKAY FIRST OF ALL OF I WANT TO REMIND. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHEN WE HAD A HEARING HERE A FEW MONTHS AGO. RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF PEACH IN THE END WE WENT OVER THAT PROCESS -- THEY WERE VERY SPEAKERS. AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR REPRESENTING ALL THE INDUSTRIES THAT WE HAD HERE TODAY AND SOME THAT ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. I POSED THE QUESTION I ASKED ABOUT HOW WE WERE GOING TO RESOLVE -- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR GRID AND OF ASKED IF IF -- THEY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE -- SOME CENTRO PROCUREMENT. MECHANISM -- FOR THE STATE AND EVERYBODY ALMOST SANG IN CHORUS A GREEN THAT SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE AND I THINK. GENERALLY FROM WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION IS THERE'S NO REAL OPPOSITION TO THIS PROCESS BUT CONCERNS ABOUT. THIS BILL DOING THINGS. THAT I'M EVERYBODY HAS A THEORY THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO DO SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY TO HURT THEM AS AN INDUSTRY EVERYBODY HAS. ON SOME -- INDIVIDUAL GOALS WHETHER IT BE -- ONE INDUSTRY OR ANOTHER ST I WANT THIS PROCESS TO YIELD MORE FOR ME SPECIFICALLY. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH THIS CURRENT BILL. THAT EVERYBODY WANTS A PROVISION IN THERE. TOO TO INFLUENCE A NEUTRAL. AND AN IMPARTIAL PROCESS. AND GIVE THEM SOME LEVEL OF OF OF OF POLITICAL BENEFIT. AND AND THAT THAT'S WHY BILLS LIKE THIS ARE VERY DIFFICULT. SOME PEOPLE ARE ARE YOU IN IS GOING TO PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS SOME PEOPLE'S ARGUING IT'S KINDA YOU KNOW -- HOW CREATE OF? OF A BUREAUCRACY WITH NEW POWERS NOTHING IN THAT IN THAT IS IN THE BILL AND AND I JUST WANTED -- TO COME BACK TO THIS FRIEDMAN BECAUSE I THINK YOUR COMMENTS. ADEQUATELY APPROPRIATELY DESCRIBE WHAT THE BILL DOES WHAT IT DOESN'T DO. AND OUTSIDE OF THAT I MEAN. OUTSIDE OF HAVING TO WRITE. A LITTLE BENEFIT FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE OR YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE HOW WE RIGHT THE BILL. THAT ACCOMPLISHES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE BECAUSE OF THEIR SOME REAL THREATS TO OUR GREAT WE'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE THOSE. AND THEN WE'RE GET WEEK WE GO THROUGH THE SAUSAGE MAKING PROCESS EVERYBODY WANTS THEIR LITTLE CARVE OUT -- I WANTED YOU TO MAYBE -- MADE. OF ADDRESS -- IF YOU COULD RESPOND -- TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RELATED. TO THIS BILL HAVE IN. NEW BROAD POWERS AND THIS BILL. BE IN A SPECIFIC TOOL. TO PUT OTHER. ENTITIES OUT OF BUSINESS I MEAN I HEARD OF SOME. SOME SOME ARGUMENTS THAT. WERE ABOUT A BILL THAT I THAT I THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN I HAVEN'T I'VE READ THIS BILL AND DOESN'T. SPECIFICALLY STATE OUT ALL THIS STUFF SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE CALM THE FEARS HERE OF ALL THE PEOPLE HERE THERE ARE. CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL HAS AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE. MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MADE -- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'M I'D LIKE TO OFFER A COUPLE THOUGHTS FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS -- A COMMENT MADE THAT THIS BILL HAS EXPANDED FROM ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE THAT IT STARTED OUT SMALL GOT REALLY BIG IN FACT IT HAS MOVED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. SINCE THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED AND PLACED INTO PRINT -- THE AUTHORITY TO PROCURE HAS BEEN pREDUCED RELATIVE TO THE INITIAL VERSION WHICH PROVIDED MUCH BROADER POWERS NOW THE BILL AS IT EXISTS IN PRINT TODAY. LINKS THE ABILITY OF THIS COMMUNITY TO OPERATE ONLY TO AUTHORIZATION ALREADY PROVIDED IN EXISTING LAW FOR THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM UNDER SECTION. THREE EIGHTY FOR THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAM UNDER SECTION FOR FIFTY FOUR POINT. FIFTY ONE FOR THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS WHICH IS IN SECTION THREE NINETY NINE POINT THIRTEEN ALL EXISTING LAW PROVISIONS. THERE'S NO NEW PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY PRESENTED HERE -- THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS RAISED AT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW -- THE STATE WIDE ENTITY TO GO FORWARD AND SIGN LONG TERM CONTRACTS FOR NEW RESOURCES IN THAT THAT RESULT WOULD ONLY OCCUR. IF THIS BILL WERE PASSED IN FACT. EXISTING LAW UNDER THE RESEARCH UNDER THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAM AUTHORIZES THAT EXACT RESULT AND JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ISSUED A RULING IN THAT CASE -- DIRECTING COMMENTS THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF PROCUREMENT TO OCCUR OF BRAND NEW RESOURCES IN THE STATE. AND IF SO IF ANY LOW SERVING AND HE DIDN'T SATISFY THEIR SHARE OF THAT NEED WHETHER THEY SHOULD USE A BACKSTOP MECHANISM. AND THE BACKSTOP MECHANISM THAT'S THE UTILITIES SO. THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THAT IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE IS DO YOU REALLY WANT THE UTILITIES TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THEIR ROLE. AS THE PROCUREMENT AND EIGHTY OF LAST RESORT FOR THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE TO TRANSPORT THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO A STATE ENTITY BECAUSE WE ARE RECOGNIZING THE REALITIES ON THE GROUND TODAY WHICH IS THAT THE UTILITIES ARE GETTING SLIMMER NOT BIGGER WE WANT THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR CORE FUNCTIONS. MAINTAINING SAFETY AND RELIABILITY THIS BILL DOES NOT CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF ANY CCA OR DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDER. TO SERVE THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS AND TO BUILD THEIR OWN PORTFOLIO ON AND IT DOES NOT PROVIDE NEW WITH FORTY FOR THE COMMISSION TO REGULATE CCA'S IN FACT IT'S EXPLICITLY WE HAVE A PROVISION IN THE BILL THE COULD NOT BE MORE EXPLICIT ON THIS POINT SO -- I DO SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT -- SOME OF THE CRITICS THAT HAVE BEN MADE ABOUT THE BILL ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT THE BILL AND PRINT THEY SEEM TO BE ABOUT SOME OTHER CONCEPT. WE'LL GO TO CENTER STONE CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT THE OPPOSITION LIKE TO RESPOND TO WHAT THE PROPONENTS ARE SAYING AND THEN IF THE S. C. E. REP WOULD MIND COMING BACK UP I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR HER. WE WE CERTAINLY DO DISAGREE WITH MR FRIEDMAN'S ANALYSIS -- IT IS NOT CURRENTLY LAW THAT THE CPUC MAY ORDER PROCUREMENT THROUGH THE I. R. P. PROCESS ON A LONG TERM BASIS WITHOUT. PROVIDING THE CCA'S WITH AN OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY TO BURKE HERE. AND EXCEPT FOR RELIABILITY PURPOSES FOR A COMPLIANCE VIOLATION THE I. R. P. ITSELF IS NOT A COMPLIANCE PROCUREMENT -- PROCESS IT IS A PLANNING DOCUMENT AND WHEN THERE'S A DEFICIENCY IN AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN THE CBC CAN ORDER THAT DEFICIENCY TO BE FIXED TO BE CURED. AND CAN ORDER THAT PLAN TO BE REFILED -- IT DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO GO OUT AND BUY LONG RANGE ENERGY FOR A CCA TODAY -- ON THE BASIS OF AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN -- PROCESS OF THE TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS MENTIONED AT THE CBC I MIGHT ALSO MENTION -- THE THE JUDGE IN THAT CASE RECENTLY NOTED THAT THAT WAS BASED ON NO DATA AND NO ANALYSIS AND WAS JUST. AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE DISCUSSING SO I MIGHT NOTE THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU AND GOD TO THIS ESSIE RIP IT IS I READ TO THE BILL IT SEEMS TO BE MORE. ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT RATHER THAN A BACKSTOP FOR PROCUREMENT -- THIS BILL IS AUTHORIZING CAP COUGH -- TO UNDERTAKE BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT BUT THIS PROCUREMENT SEE THE FOCUS MORE ON ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS NOT A SHORTAGE OF ELECTRICITY IT LIKE YOU. TO COMMENT ON THAT ALSO -- WHEN BE SURE THAT THE POWER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT? REQUIRED TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON BUT RATHER TO MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS NUMBER TWO AND THE THIRD QUESTION THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE FOR ME. IN A ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED AREA THAT I REPRESENT -- WILL THE WILL THIS IF IT BECOMES LAW HAVE A PROPENSITY TO INCREASE RATES OR WILL HAVE A PROPENSITY TO DECREASE RATES TO OUR REPAIRS. FOR THE CALIFORNIA EDISON HAS SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS WITH -- TO INTRODUCTION OF A STATE GOVERNMENT ENTITY INTO THE WHOLE CELL PER KERMAN. THE ROLE OF THE LAST TIME DURING THE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ENERGY CRISIS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND FOR INTO THESE LONG TERM CONTRACTS THE STATE'S. UNDERSTANDABLY WAS ARE YOU A WITH CONTRACTING AND AGO SHADING UNDER A VOLATILE AND UNSAVORY MARKET CONDITION AND THAT THAT DURING THAT TIME HOWEVER THE STATE LACK THE ABILITY A TO TO REALLY CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED CONTRACT WHICH RESULTED IN MANY HIGH PRICE CONTRACTS SIGNED. THOSE CONTRACT COSTS ARE STILL BEING PAID FOR TODAY BY A CALIFORNIA REPAIRS SO THERE IS SOME IMPLEMENT ABILITY IMPLEMENTS ABILITY PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE IN ALLOWING A STATE ENTITY TO BE FORMED -- THAT IT THAT. GET A WITH THIS THE STATE AND IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY. TO NEGOTIATE WELL FOR REPAIRS OF THIS IS A STATE ENTITY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO DO THE ONGOING CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION WORK THAT WOULD RESULT IN PERFORMANCE OF THESE CONTRACTS AND THE RESOURCE THAT MAKING SURE THE RESOURCES DISPATCH CORRECTLY AND FINANCIALLY SETTLED. AND THAT -- AND THAT DIGITAL ART OUR CUSTOMERS WHAT THE BRACE THAT THEY MAY PAY THROUGH THIS AUTHORITY WOULD THAT BE FAIR AND JUST AND REASONABLE. THAT SO SO THAT'S THE THAT'S ADDRESSES SENATOR YOUR SECOND QUESTION ON THE FIRST QUESTION ON THIS. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL I UNDERSTOOD WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE WHERE THE AUTHOR AND THE SUPPORT. COMES FROM IS THAT THIS ENTITY WHAT PURPOSE DO PROCUREMENT FOR BOTH RELIABILITY BASED RESOURCES AS WELL AS POLICY DRIVEN CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES FOR THE REALIZED BUT REALIZABLE RELIABILITY FOCUS RESOURCE THAT ARE NEEDED -- THINK HIGH SO THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR ALREADY PERFORMS THAT BACKSTOPS FUNCTION FOR ALL LOOSE HAVING ENTITIES GENERALLY WE DO AGREE US UP AMONG MANY STAKEHOLDERS THAT. IT IS NOT IDEAL TO HALF. EXPANSION OF THIS YOU KNOW THE BACKSTOP NEED THAT EVERY LOW SERVING ENTITY OUGHT TO BE DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE TO MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM. OPERATES RELIABLY ON THE MATTER OF POLICY DRIVEN CLEAN ENERGY DRIVEN. BROKER MEN WELL THAT'S THE REASON THAT'S THE REASON THAT CC IS OUR FORM TO PROVIDE A CLEAN OPTION WE TO UNDER PAUL THAT'S BEEN PASSED BY THIS BODY UNDER SB TWO FIFTY AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AS WELL AS AS THE ONE HUNDRED ALSO HAVE TO MEET THOSE CLEAN. ENERGY OBJECTIVE ARE WE BELIEVE THAT WE DO A GOOD JOB OF THAT RIGHT NOW AND THAT IF THERE ARE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS MARKET WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT MORE EQUAL OVERSIGHT OF ALL THOSE THINGS AND LOW SERVING ENTITY TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL PROVIDERS. ART BRING OUR DELIVERING WHAT THEY ARE HERE THEIR PROMISE TO DELIVER THANK YOU OKAY SO AGAIN BUT BUT MY MY MY AUNT LAST QUESTION ANSWERED. IF THIS BILL IS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IS THERE A HIGHER PROPENSITY THE ELECTRICAL RATES ARE GOING TO GO UP. WHERE THEY CAN SAY THE SAME ARE THEY GONNA GO DOWN? GENERALLY WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS WOULD HAVE A PORT PRESSURES ON ON RATES OKAY AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION. HOW IF YOU ARE DOING THAT PROCUREMENT HOW DO YOU BALANCE? THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANDATES THAT THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S PUT INTO A FACTOR SB THREE FIFTY ETCETERA. VERSUS FINDING THE THE LOWEST COST ELECTRICITY. TO PROVIDE -- LOW COST -- ENERGY AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PACE OF THE HIGHEST UTILITY RATES IN THE COUNTRY. WE WOULD DO THAT THROUGH THE OVERSIGHT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. EVERY CONTRACT EVERY LONG TERM CONTRACTS WE SIGNED A SUBJECT TO THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE STATE AUTHORITY. AND WE GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS PROCEEDING PROCESS MISTER FREEMAN HAS PARTICIPATED IN MANY OTHERS PRECEDING AND CHALLENGE THE COSTS REASONABLENESS OF THOSE CONTRACTS SO I EXPECT THAT IF WE CONTINUE IN THIS ROLE THAT HE NONETHELESS WILL BE A VERY COMPELLING VOICE AND AND CHALLENGING. BUT AT THE COST REASON WHEN THIS OF VARIOUS CONTRACT WE ENTER INTO ON BEHALF OF REPAIRS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. AND JUST TO FIVE COULD. BEEN SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THAT LAST INSTANCE. THOSE ARE THE VERY ARGUMENTS WHY PEOPLE AGREE THAT WE NEED SOME AGENCY THAT ITS EQUIPPED TO HANDLE ANY CASE WHERE SOMEBODY GOES INTO BANKRUPTCY OR OR IF SERVICES INTERRUPTED. HER ARGUMENTS WAS. THEY TREAT IT RIGHT THEY ENTERED THE WORKFORCE INTO CONTRACTS THAT WERE NOT GOOD FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE. BY PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT WELL EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THAT. AND SO. WHAT THEY'RE BY SAYING THAT THERE ARE YOU IN FOR THE STATUS QUO? TO REPEAT THAT PROCESS AGAIN. AS OPPOSED TO HAVE THE IN AN AGENCY THAT'S EQUIPPED THAT'S EXPERIENCE THAT. HAS A SPECIFIC MISSION ACCOMPLISHED THIS. THERE ST WERE AFRAID THAT I MIGHT THAT MIGHT RESULT. IN LIKE WHAT WE WE HAD IN THE PAST [inaudible] HONESTLY. I I JUST DON'T BUY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VALID ARGUMENT BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS TO PREVENT. SOMETHING LIKE THAT [inaudible] CENTER RUBIO [inaudible] THANK YOU. WELL FIRST OF ALL I THINK THE AUTHOR I MEAN I AT DEATHLY UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS SPELL AND I THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE ADVOCATES THAT NOR MY OFFICE SHARON AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THEM. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT BUT SOCAL EDISON IS IN MY DISTRICT AND SO THEY HAD SOME CONCERNS AND I'M JUST. MIGHT RIGHT NOW I'M. KIND OF CONCERNED HOW WE GOT SO FAR AWAY FROM YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND THE OPPOSITION IS AND THERE'S SO MUCH MISINFORMATION AND I JUST WANNA. SEE BECAUSE FOR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW DID YOU. COME TO THE TABLE WERE THOSE DISCUSSIONS LIKE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE WERE ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS. CAN YOU SHARE. YEAH I'M GOING TO DEFER -- TO KATIE WITH SALES BEEN PART OF THE PROCESS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. AT GOOD MORNING CENTER I'M THE PROCESS BEGAN IN FEBRUARY EVERYBODY WAS INVITED TO THE TABLE AND A SERIES OF MEETINGS AND ASK FOR IMPACT ON THE GENERAL STRUCTURE. AND FEEDBACK ON AMENDMENTS -- WE PARTICIPATED IN ALL OF THOSE MEETINGS WE MET WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE PROBABLY FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AT THIS POINT SUBMITTED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE BELL AND ALL THOSE AMENDMENTS WERE ACCEPTED -- I DO THINK THAT AND WE AS I SAID WE ARE CAN CONSUMER CHOICE ADVOCATES WE DO BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW HAVING COMPETITION AND ALL THAT IS GREAT AND IMPORTANT IN SUPPORT THAT -- IF WE THOUGHT THIS BILL WAS ABOUT FREDDIE NOT DOWN WE WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING IT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT. A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE HEARD THAT THIS BILL WILL SHUT DOWN CCA -- AND SO THEY'RE REACTING TO SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD REACT TO AS WELL WHICH IS WELL NO WE DON'T WANT THE CA TO SHUT DOWN -- BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LOOK INTO THE BILL THE TEARS MENTION AND YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WE DO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT LANGUAGE. TO ELIMINATE THE AMBIGUITY AND HOW THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO THE PROCESS IS ON GOING I THINK WE ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE MEETING OVER SUMMER RECESS SINCE WE DO HAVE A FEW WEEKS. TO KEEP WORKING ON LANGUAGE. ECONOMIC ASSET POSITION TO ADDRESS -- HOW YOU GUYS CAME TO THE TABLE AND DISCUSS THIS ISSUE THANK YOU SO I WILL NOTE THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY -- EACH VOTE WAS -- BREAKFAST ON THE THE BASIS THAT. THE CONCERNS THAT CCA'S WERE BRINGING UP WOULD BE ADDRESSED WE DID PROVIDE -- AMENDMENTS AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS NONE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS WERE ACCEPTED. AND IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT PROCESS SO I JUST WANT TO HEAR THAT. CAN WE ADDRESS SOME. THOSE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I UNITE NON THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT HE'S BEEN REALLY GOOD IN THE PAST IN IN TERMS OF ALWAYS COME TO THE TABLE AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT HE ENGAGES EVERYONE. AND I JUST WANNA ADDRESS THOSE AMENDMENTS WHAT AMENDMENTS DO YOU THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO SOLVE YOUR CONCERN WITH WE BEGAN. BY ADDRESSING THE THAT THE AUTHORS STATEMENT ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL BEING A BACKSTOP FUNCTION -- FOR RELIABILITY AND PROVIDE AMENDMENTS TO THAT EFFECT -- THAT WOULD NARROW THE BILL TO DOING THAT AS OPPOSED TO DOING LONG RANGE ENERGY PROCUREMENT PLANNING ON BEING AND PURCHASING ON BEHALF OF ALL. ELECTRIC PROVIDERS -- WE ALSO PROVIDED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY CENTRAL -- BUYER FLOW TO THE GENERATION SIDE OF THE BILL -- AND WE ALSO PROVIDE AMENDMENTS WHICH WE NOW SEE IN THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE APPRECIATE THIS THAT IT BE CLEARER THE CCA HAVE THE RIGHT -- TO SELF PROVIDE AND AND SO THOSE OF THE THE THE PRIMARY AMENDMENTS THAT WE WERE ADDRESSING -- AS THE BILL IT BECAME MORE OBVIOUS THAT THE BILL WAS A VEHICLE TO DEAL WITH EITHER A SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC WISHING TO EXIT FROM GENERATION OR RESTRUCTURING OF THE P. GINNY -- WE ESSENTIALLY SAID WELL HOW DO YOU NOT APPLY THE SAME STANDARD FOR LONG RANGE PLANNING OF A UTILITY WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR POWER PURCHASES. TO SCCA WHICH ALREADY HAS A LONG RANGE PLANNING BODY WHICH IS IT'S GOVERNMENT. ENTITY. AND AND SO ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL IS APPLYING A STANDARD IT IT'S DOING TWO THINGS IT'S DOING BACKSTOP RETIREMENT AND IT'S ALSO DOING LONG RANGE PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT. AND THOSE TWO THINGS. ARE DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO ONE BILL AND HAVE IT APPLY TO EVERYONE IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE CCA'S ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN FOR PROFIT UTILITIES -- WE ALREADY HAVE RATE PAYERS WHO APPROVE OUR PROCUREMENT -- PART WERE OWNED BY RATE PAYERS ARE BOARD IS ELECTED BY RATE PAYERS AND ARE IN A GREAT RESOURCE PLAN IS PRIMARILY APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BODY -- IT GOES TO THE CBC FOR INFORMATION SHARING AND FOR A COMPLIANCE CHECK THAT IT'S COMPLETE -- BUT IT DOESN'T GO THERE -- TO SEE IF -- WE'VE PROCURED EXACTLY WHAT THE PC WANTS US TO PREPARE YOU KNOW EIGHT YEARS OUT -- SO I THINK -- I THINK THAT'S THE THE PRIMARY CONCERN. IF I MAKE SENATOR AND THAT I JUST TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST STATED IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INTENT OF THIS BUT WAS NEVER TO BE JUST ABOUT RELIABILITY WAS ALSO ABOUT ENSURING. THAT THE STATE HAD THE TOOLS TO ENSURING THAT THE CLEAN ENERGY TARGET WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SAY HI MANY OF OUR PARTNERS FIRMLY BELIEVE IS VERY CRITICAL. WE THINK THAT THIS BILL SO I JUST WANT TO SAY AS WELL THAT I BELIEVE THE CCA'S HAVEN'T MET WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- SINCE THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR VOTE AND THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING HOW DO WE RECTIFY WHAT'S IN THE BILL AND WHAT THEIR SCENE IS WRONG WITH THE BILL WITH WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THE BELL WHAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS AT THE STATE. HAVE A STRONG BACK UP BOTH FOR THE RELIABILITY AND FOR THE CLEAN ENERGY AND MOVING OUT AWAY FROM THE I. O. U.'S WE DID MEET WITH THE OFFICE SINCE THAT BUT SO WELL. EARLIER I HEARD THOUGHTS ON NONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN BUT I ALSO HEARD THAT. THERE AND THE CURRENT SUGGESTED AMENDMENT CRAZY IN THE BILL CORRECT AND SO -- I JUST HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FOR ME MY CONCERN WAS THAT I KNOW THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON GREAT RELIABILITY MAKING SUE THERE'S ANOTHER BACK WITH BANKRUPTCY WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TO HANDLE SOMETHING OF THAT MAGNITUDE AND I KNOW THAT. THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN MY PERSONAL OPINION IS P. JEANNIE WILL WHO IS IN BANKRUPTCY BUT THEN WE HAVE SEND HICKEL WHO IS HAS BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT JUST STEPPING AWAY FROM PROCUREMENT. AND THEN WE HAVE THE THIRD. ONE IN MY OPINION WHICH IS -- I THOUGHT COUNT MEDICINE WHO HAPPENS TO BE MY DISTRICT AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING. THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WE HAVE ONE IN BANKRUPTCY THE OTHER ONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO FOR CARE AND THEN WE HAVE THAT. PERSON IN THE MIDDLE SO I'M VERY OPEN TO AND I GUESS THAT I KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN REALLY. GRACIOUS AND STOPPING BY TALKING TO ME AND WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES I I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CONVERSATIONS. MOVING FORWARD IN TRYING TO AT LEAST YOU KNOW SELL SOME OF THESE CONCERNS OUT HERE -- BUT WITH THAT I GUESS I JUST WANT A CLARIFICATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. I YEAH I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE MISSING MOST THE TESTIMONY I'VE READ -- YOU KNOW THE ANALYSIS -- I GUESS IS SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF OF THIS TYPE OF BILL RESOURCE ADEQUACY THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF THE CCA'S -- IN MY DISTRICT -- I LOOK AT THIS IN -- BUT I DO HAVE. SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ID CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY WE SHOULD BE PLANNING A LOOKING OUT AHEAD. OF FOR RESOURCES BUT I'M REALLY CONFUSED WE WE'VE HAD SEX LAST NIGHT MR GARCIA YOU AND I TOO LATE IN THE EVENING ACTUALLY BUT NEVERTHELESS IT'S THE IDEA THAT WE WOULDN'T. THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE OR OR THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE P. YOU SEE -- PURCHASING FOR LET'S JUST SAY CCA'S OR ANYBODY ON CONTRACTS TEN YEARS OUT. YEAH MAYBE. I I I I DON'T. I THINK THE THIRD SHOULD BE LIKE A PROVISION THAT WOULD SAY OKAY IN YOUR SEVEN THROUGH TEN WE DON'T THINK THAT YOUR DO WITH THE WAY THIS THING IS GOING TO YOU'RE GOING TO MEET YOUR NEEDS -- YOU SHOULD GIVE THAT. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROCURE. THEIR OWN ENERGY INSTEAD OF HAVING TO BE YOU SEE DO IT AND IF I MAY NOT HAVE -- YEAH THIS EXACTLY CORRECT BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY FOR THE CCA'S THE WAY THIS BILL READS TODAY. SENATOR -- BY MAY ON THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SPECIFICALLY THAT ARE IN THE ANALYSIS TODAY -- CROSS REFERENCE THE RIGHTS OF CCA'S TO SELF PROVIDE THEIR SHARE OF ANY IDENTIFIED LONG TERM NEED UNDER SECTION FOR FIFTY FOUR POINT. FIFTY ONE THAT SECTION ALLOWS CCA'S ONCE IN NEED AS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO PROPOSE HOW THEY WOULD MEET THEIR SHARE OF THAT NEED. IF THERE PROPOSAL IS SUFFICIENT THEN THE CCA WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LONG TERM PROCUREMENT THAT IS DONE ON A BACKSTOPS BASIS THAT SAID THAT'S THE PROPOSAL IN THIS BILL IS TO GIVE CCA'S. AS THEY HAVE UNDER SECTION FOR FIFTY FOUR POINT FIFTY ONE THAT RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES IF THE NEED IS IDENTIFIED IT'S ONLY IF THE CCA FAILS TO MEET THAT NEED AFTER IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED. THAT BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT WOULD BE INVOKED AND THAT'S CURRENT LAW WE'RE LINKING IT REALLY TO THE EXISTING PROCESS WE'RE NOT CREATING ANY NEW MANDATES HERE. THIS FEATURE CAN I PROCEED ABSOLUTELY. THIS SITE FIRST COULD YOU. COMMENT ON THAT PLEASE. YES SO. THE PROCESS TODAY DIDN'T WORK WERE WERE KIND OF SPLITTING HAIRS HERE BECAUSE I OUR P. IS A PLANNING PROCESS THAT'S USED TODAY AND IT IS USED FOR PROCUREMENT BASIS FOR I'LL USE TO DO LONG RANGE OF PROCUREMENT. IT'S ALSO USED BY DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS AND CCA'S TO INFORM THE QC THE I SO AND OTHERS ABOUT WHAT LONG RANGE -- PROCUREMENT THE CCA'S AND DIRECT ACCESS ARE DOING AND THERE IS A CHECKPOINT THERE WERE THE CPUC CAN SAY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS INSUFFICIENT OR YOU NEED TO MAKE A CORRECTION YOU NEED TO REFILE YOUR PLAN YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND DO ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT -- WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT IS THAT YOU SEE ONLY HAS THE RIGHT TO ORDER BACKSTOPS RETIREMENT FOR THOSE RESOURCES? IF THERE IS THE ACTUAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY -- THIS BILL CHANGES OUT AND SAYS THE I. R. P. ITSELF BECOMES A COMPLIANCE PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS AS OPPOSED TO JUST A PLANNING DOCUMENT. AND AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT HERE THE STABLE. THAT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE WHAT I'VE HEARD SO I MAY I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA. COME TOGETHER ON THIS BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BONE OF CONTENTION I NAY -- ACTIVE. I REALLY THINK THAT THE LAST STATEMENT MISREPRESENTS CURRENT LAW -- AND A REVIEW OF THE STATUTORY PROVISION THAT I MENTIONED WHICH IS PART OF THE I. R. P. CODE SECTION FOR FIFTY FOUR POINT. FIFTY ONE DIRECTS THE PC IF IT IDENTIFIES A DEFICIT RELATIVE TO THE PORTFOLIO IS ADOPTED. TO ALLOW CCA'S TO SELF PROVIDE THEIR SHARE OF ANY IDENTIFIED NEED AND IF THAT CHAIR OF IDENTIFIED NEED IS NOT SELF PROVIDED. IT DIRECTS THE COMMISSION. TO AUTHORIZE THE UTILITIES TO DO LONG TERM PROCUREMENT AND TO CHARGE ALL CUSTOMERS IN THE SYSTEM THAT'S THE LAW AS IT IS TODAY AND THE P. C. HAS ALREADY BEEN MOVING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENT THAT PROVISION. THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT AT ALL IT DOESN'T ADD TO IT DOESN'T SUBTRACT FROM IT. SO I UNDERSTAND THE CCA'S HAVE AN IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITION TO PC OVERSIGHT OF THEIR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROSPER AUNTS AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME IN HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY THE COMMISSION. THEY HAVE BEEN APPROVED REJECTED MODIFIED THERE IS A WHOLE PROCESS UNDER WAY AS WE SPEAK -- THIS BILL DOESN'T TOUCH THAT PROCESS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BRIGHT LINES THAT AS SPONSORS WE FELT THIS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS BILL. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE DETAILS OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY HAVE THESE MECHANISMS WERE SIMPLY CHANGING THE IDENTITY OF THE BACKSTOP PROCURE. AND RATHER THAN BEING THE UTILITY WERE PROPOSING TO HAVE A STATE ENTITY BE THAT THAT -- PROCUREMENT ENTITY [inaudible] SENATOR [inaudible] SKINNER. AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE CENTER RUBIO -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] I'M. JT EFFORT. THAT THE AUTHOR IS AN WHAT THE INTENTION TO TRY TO NOT TRY BUT TO HAVE A BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE GRADE RELIABILITY. AND I'VE MET WITH THE AUTHORIZED MET WITH -- SPONSORS -- I STILL FEEL LIKE THIS BILL NEEDS -- IT. I AM ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR TREASURERS LETTER. BECAUSE IF WE'RE ASKING THE TREASURER'S OFFICE THROUGH CAPE DEATH TO PLAY SUCH A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. IT IT JUST IT SEEMS LIKE THIS BILL WOULD BENEFIT FROM BECOMING A TO YOUR BILL SO THAT THE WORK COULD BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THIS CORRECTLY AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE JUST TOOK. VERY SIGNIFICANT ACTION AFFECTING OUR UTILITIES -- I KNOW THE ASSEMBLY HASN'T YET APPROVED THE BILL BUT THE IT'S OVER TO THE SET ASSEMBLY NOW. THE SENATE IS ALSO GOING TO BE LOOKING AT BUDGET COMMITTEE TODAY A SECOND BILL. NOW WELL THOSE ARE COUCHED AROUND WILDFIRE THEY REALLY ARE ABOUT STABILITY FOR UTILITIES NOW THERE MAY BE THE ARGUMENT THAT IT DOESN'T. DEAL WITH ENSURING THAT OUR UTILITIES CAN PROCURE ADEQUATELY BUT I THINK THE STABILITY OF THE UTILITIES IS THE THING THAT WE FIRST AND FOREMOST HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHICH WE ARE DEALING WITH. AND THEN I THINK IT GIVES US SOME TIME TO LOOK AT ALL RIGHT WHAT ELSE NOW DO WE NEED. TO GIVE OUR GREAT THE RELIABILITY THAT WE NEED SO I'M NOT READY TO VOTE AFFIRMATIVELY FOR THE BILL TODAY [inaudible] CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STATE AGENCY THAT'S GOING TO BE CREATED -- IS A NOT LIKE I SAID I'VE EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS AND I DO SHARE -- SENATOR SKIN IS CONCERNED THAT -- IT SEEMS TO BE A LIVE A FAST ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SO MANY INTERSECTIONS IN TERMS OF THE WILDFIRE INSURANCE EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING BUT IN TERMS OF THAT AGENCY I MEAN. I WOULD IMAGINE IT NEEDS TIME TO BE. SOLIDIFY PUT TOGETHER AND SURE THAT IT'S FUNCTIONAL CAN YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND DOT WILL IT HAVE THE EXPERTISE HOW ARE WE GONNA SELECT. THE BOARD CAN YOU. EDUCATE ME SO WE ARM. WERE ASKED TO CONSIDER THIS ENTITY IN THE ASSEMBLY UTILITIES A COMMITTEE. ORIGINALLY WE HAD PROPOSED. OF PUTTING TOGETHER A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION -- MADE UP OF THE EXPERTS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO OVERSEE -- THIS TASK. WE SPOKE TO AFTER YESTERDAY AND BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE A PATH -- CLEARLY THE LETTER THAT DAVE -- SENT -- RAISES CONCERNS SIMILAR CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WHEN ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY TO EASE COMMITTEE. BUT WE HAVE. SIX PLUS WEEKS OF A WORK STILL TO DO IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND I'M COMMITTED TO TAKE IN YOU KNOW EVERY. HELP ENSURE THAT. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND WORK TOWARDS A PATH -- FOR THIS ENTITY OR IF WE CAN GET SOME DIALOGUE. GOING AGAIN WITH SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY PLEASE COMMITTEE A CONSIDER -- ANOTHER ENTITY THAT MAY HAVE. THE EXPERTISE TO DO SO -- ONE ENTITY THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE SHOULD BE -- OVERSEEING THIS IS THE CAL I SAW -- BECAUSE OF THE OVERSIGHT THAT THE EXISTE ARE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO THAT'S ONE ENTITY THAT WE'VE -- COMPLETELY SAID DOT WILL NOT WORK FOR US SO -- LOOK I I REALIZE THAT FOR SOME FOLKS THE BILL IS NOT FULLY. THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE COOKED IT ISN'T -- THIS IS THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND WE'RE LOOKING TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE EVEN THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSING -- THE BILL TODAY -- TO WORK WITH US I THINK NO ONE DISAGREES THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE. A CENTRALIZED A PROCESS HERE TO ENSURE THAT -- ONE WE DON'T SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND NUMBER -- TWO GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE I. O. U.'S. INSTABILITY ON THAT THAT DOES NOT -- IMPACT. UP RATE PAYERS IN CALIFORNIA OR FOR THAT MATTER THE LIGHTS NOT BEING ABLE TO TURN ON FOR FOLKS IN THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR FOR ADDRESSING THAT THAT YOU KNOW AS I BEGIN. YOU NEAR MY CONCERNS COMING IN HERE AND DOC AND I FEEL A LITTLE. UNCOMFORTABLE. MOVING FORWARD OF THE BILL THAT'S NOT. AS YOU PUT IT FULLY COOKED I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF LOOSE ENDS BUT I AM FULLY I AM ENCOURAGED. BY WHAT I JUST HEARD IN THAT IS THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH NOT ONLY. AS IT PERTAINS TO THAT THAT COMMITTEE OR COMMISSION BUT ALSO WITH THE OPPOSITION AND AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT I STILL FEEL THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. AND YOU KNOW I WILL RESERVE TODAY I WILL SUPPORTIVE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN GET THERE BUT I NEED TO KNOW. WHEN IT COMES TO US THAT ALL THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THANK YOU? THANK YOU I I JUST WANTED ALSO MENTION THAT I I THINK THAT THERE IS. ALSO A PATH TO ADDRESSING -- THE PROCUREMENT -- OPTION THAT EDISON HAS RAISED THAT THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT NOW WE KNOW TWO YEARS AGO. THAT WAS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT THE SHARED IN THEIR BUSINESS MODEL -- BUT THE TODAY -- THAT'S CHANGED IN AND SO WE'RE WILLING TO ALSO EXPLORE HOW THAT OPTION MAY BE. INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL -- BILL AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU MR TRUMP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIR WIENER I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU THE AUTHOR AS WELL -- FOR SITTING DOWN WITH US AND AND FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND FOR A MANY OTHER HIGH ENERGY -- ISSUES -- SUPPORTED YOUR OTHER ENERGY BILLS SAY YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF GREAT WORK. ON ON THIS ONE AS I EXPRESS TO YOU I DO HAVE -- OUR CONCERNS THIS IS A BILL THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GET TO A POINT THAT I CAN SUPPORTER BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD -- IN THIS BILL FOR WHATEVER REASON I'M NOT. I'M NOT EXPRESS ANY OPINIONS ON THIS OR SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A OF THE BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION. OR WHAT BUT I I'M HOPING THAT -- IF THIS BILL GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE ON THAT THERE CAN BE A REINVIGORATION OF OF YOU KNOW. AND I'VE BEEN THERE AND WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE ON BILLS BEFORE WHERE THEY'RE JUST YOU KNOW SOMETIMES SOMETHING IS NOT CLICKING WITH THE COMMUNICATION AND SOMETIMES. NEWS HAS TO HAVE THE RESET BUTTON AND START OVER AGAIN -- I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GO UP ON THE BILL TODAY -- IF IT -- IF IT GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE OR IF IT'S TO YOUR BILL OR WHATEVER HAPPENS WITH THAT -- I DO HOPE TO BE ABLE. TO ABLE TO VOTE FOR WHEN I GUESS OF FLORIDA'S I EXPRESS TO YOU ALL TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT IT -- BUT THAT'S WHERE I AM TODAY. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE AND I SORRY I MISSED MOST YOUR TESTIMONY BUT I KNOW THE GIST OF THIS BILL AND IT'S ABOUT. RELIABILITY I MEAN AND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IN A NUTSHELL IS TRYING TO ASSURE THAT WE HAVE -- POWER WHEN NEEDED AND CURE MADE BE A LONG TERM OR SHORT TERM IS IS CRITICAL AND AGAIN I I WORK FOR UTILITY COMPANY DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS. AND IT WAS DUE TO OUR FAILURE. TO PLAN AND PREPARE IS DO WITH OUR FELLOW YOUR TO ENTER LONG TERM CONTRACTS THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES BUYING POWER ON THE SPOT MARKET WHEN THE DA AT MARKET AND IT LED TO A DISASTER. THIS IS ONE OF THE SAFEGUARDS IT'S GONNA AVOID US DOING THAT BY MAKING SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES WHEN NEEDED. AND IF YOU'RE POLLS THIS BILL THEN YOU'RE OPPOSED. TO SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT SYSTEM RELIABILITY. AND IF YOU'RE POLLS THIS BILL IS ABOUT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS. BUT IF YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL IT'S ABOUT WHAT WE ALL SAY WE CONCERNED ABOUT A RELIABLE SYSTEM AND THAT'S NUMBER. ONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE THE FIFTH LEADING ECONOMY AND WE HAVE A SPOTTY ELECTRICAL AND UTILITY SYSTEM AND THIS IS ABOUT SYSTEM RELIABILITY NOT BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DID YOU WANNA YEAH. YOU KNOW I AM I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. BUT I LOOK AT THIS THING AND THE IDEA THAT THE TWO OF YOU COULD NOT EVEN AGREE OR DON'T. HAVE IT IT'S LIKE YOU'RE. ON TWO DIFFERENT SEPARATE PAGES ON THE R. P.. YOUR ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT -- YOU GUYS GET ON THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE THAT IS. REALLY DISCONCERTING TO ME THE IDEA OF THIS NEW ORGANIZATION OF THE TREASURES LETTER. ALSO REALLY WORRIES ME AND I THINK A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO APPROPRIATIONS. BUT I TO AGREE WITH -- BOTH MY COLLEAGUES -- IN IN IN TERMS OF THE WHERE WHERE WHERE WE'RE GOING BAD. THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF WORK IN I DON'T THINK MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ARE WRONG. IN THEIR POSITION THAT MAYBE THIS SHOULD BE A TO YOUR BILL BUT I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR TODAY IF THESE ARE WORKED OUT. I'M NOT A BILL SUPPORTED. THANK YOU EN. YOU KNOW ON ON THE QUESTION OF A TO YOUR BILL -- WE STILL HAVE TO GET GET THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS AND AND THAT'S PART OF THIS PROCESS. AND MAKING IT WORK IS GOING TO BE. OF PART OF THE PART OF MAKING IT WORK IS MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD -- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL pMEMBERS -- YOU KNOW I KIND OF MENTION THAT -- IN OUR IN OUR HEARING ON BANKRUPTCIES. WHEN WE ASKED ALL THE SPEAKERS THATWERE BEFORE US EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT CAME TO SPEAK -- JUSTICE TESTIFY WE WE ASK THEM THIS QUESTION ABOUT. OUR SYSTEMS RELIABILITY WHETHER WE NEEDED CENTRAL PROCUREMENT AGENCY AND THERE WAS A CHORUS OF YESES. THIS IS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD WE NEED IT -- KEEP THIS CONVERSATION ALIVE. I DON'T THINK THE GOVERNOR WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT SIGNED SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T WORK IN AN ESSENTIALLY I THINK THE BILL CAN BE IMPLEMENTED. I THINK -- IN ITS CURRENT FORM I THINK YOU CAN BE IMPLEMENTED I THINK EVEN IN THE FUTURE WE CAN HAVE CLEAN UP LANGUAGE. I WOULD EVEN SUPPORT HAVE BEEN KIND OF DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE. JUST SO WE KEEP THIS CONVERSATION ALIVE AND IF WE CAN ADD THAT AS AN AMENDMENT TO KIND OF GIVE MEMBERS SOME. SENSE OF OF OF OF REASSURANCE THAT WE'RE GONNA WORK OUT ANYTHING THAT MAY COME UP THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE BILL IMPLEMENTABLE FOR WHATEVER REASON. THAT WEEKEND TAKE NEXT YEAR'S US SESSION TO TAKE ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION. THAT WOULD ALSO BE SOMETHING THAT WAS KIND OF A LAY SOME CONCERNS. OF OF EVERYBODY INVOLVED SO WE CAN SOMEHOW PROVIDE THEM SOME INSURANCE THROUGH -- THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS THAT THIS WILL BE AN OBJECTIVE PROCESS -- I I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT AFFECTS -- THE CCA'S AS AS ARE OURS OUR SPONSORS MENTIONED I AGREE WITH THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR POSITION. AND AND WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND WHAT IT DO. AND WE CAN ADD A WHOLE LIST OF OF LANGUAGE. IN THE PREAMBLE OF THE BILL -- CITING KIND OF THE INTENTIONS AND GOALS AND AND THERE'S ALL THESE WAYS THAT WE CAN HANDLE OF THE KILLING THE BILL TODAY -- I THINK IS THE WRONG ACTION BY THIS COMMITTEE IT'S OUR JOB. TO THIS IS ONE OF OUR ESSENTIAL JOBS TO WORK TO ACHIEVE. RELIABILITY IN THE SYSTEM IT WHEREVER WE CAN AND I'M JUST ASKING THAT WE WORK TOGETHER ON THIS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT EVERYBODY WOULD JUST WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT HERE WE JUST HAVE TO WORK THROUGH IT BUT ANYWAY DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU -- FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS MATTER BY WE APPRECIATE. OF THE COMMENTS MADE EVEN BY THOSE WHO WILL NOT BE ON VOTING ON THE BILL TODAY -- MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND FIND SOME GREATER COMMON GROUND. AND TO CENTER DOTS POINT I THINK CENTER WE WE HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE. I BELIEVE IN AND WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED TODAY AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IF THE BILL GETS. TO THE SENATE FLOOR ON THAT ALL OF THE ISSUES WILL BE YOU KNOW IRONED OUT THAT THAT THAT. ALL PARTIES WILL BE ON THE SAME PAGE I'M NOT SURE -- YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF YOUR BILLS EVER GET THERE I KNOW MINE DON'T -- WHERE YOU HAVE EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE AND THAT BECOMES THE DETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER OR NOT WE? MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION FOR ALL CALIFORNIA. AND SOUL FOR ME YOU KNOW MY MY COMMITMENT IS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS I APPRECIATE -- MEDICINES -- COMMENTS WE WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH WITH THEM ON CREATING A POSSIBLE OPTION TO KEEP THEM THE PROCUREMENT DRIVER SEAT -- WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH CCA'S TO CONTINUE GIVE THEM THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITY AND AUTONOMY THAT THE HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. FOR AND THEN ULTIMATELY -- TO A SET A SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT THE STATE HAS THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- FOR TO ENSURE THAT THE LIGHTS ARE ON AND THAT RATES CONTINUE TO BE AS AFFORDABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS -- THAT'S THE GOAL.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER. CENTER OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN GOOD MORNING [inaudible] ONE RESEARCHER. NO BEFORE YOU PRESENT I JUST WANTED -- TO WE HAD SOME AMENDMENTS AND WE WE'VE BEEN KIND OF DISCUSSING THEM AND IF YOU CAN A YOU YOU HAD A PROPOSAL. THAT WENT AROUND THE AMENDMENTS AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU TO PRESENT THAT FIRST REGARDING. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND I WANNA START BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THE BILL -- THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RAISE CONCERNS THAT THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT PAYMENT METHODS -- I WAS SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEED FOR NETWORK MEMBERSHIP IN ORDER TO CHARGE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE -- THE COMMITTEES IDENTIFIED A VALID CONCERN AND I'M PREPARED TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT THE BILL. I AM PROPOSING THAT TO REQUIRE THAT ALL CHARGING STATIONS BE EQUIPPED WITH AN ONSIDE ON AN ON SITE CREDIT CARD READER. IN ADDITION TO A TOLL FREE PHONE NUMBER TO PROCESS A CREDIT CARD PAYMENT. THE ONSITE CREDIT CARD READER REQUIREMENT CAN BE SATISFIED BY EITHER AND EMV CHIP READER OR A CONTACTLESS. CARD READER. YES -- CONTACTLESS CARDS ARE OUR CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS IT'S SOMETHING I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS -- THAT ARE TAPPED INSTEAD OF SWIPED THE IN THE UNITED STATES MAJOR BANKS HAVE BEGUN ROLLING OUT CONTACTLESS CARDS FOR EXAMPLE CAPITAL ONE HAS AYE CONTACTLESS CARD SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CHASE WILL ROLL OUT CONTACTLESS CARDS FOR ALL OF ITS CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD HOLDERS BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MASTERCARD EXPECTS CONTACTLESS CARDS TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO THIRDS. OF TOTAL PAYMENT VOLUMES WITHIN TWO YEARS AND VISA EXPECTS ONE HUNDRED MILLION CONTACTLESS CARDS TO BE ISSUED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. REQUIRING CREDIT CARD READERS ON EVERY CHARGING STATION ERASES THE CONCERN ABOUT CUSTOMERS ONLY BEING ABLE TO PAY THROUGH MOBILE APPLICATIONS ARE IF ID CARDS AND OVER THE PHONE -- I THINK THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE REALLY WANT TO THINK THE CHAIR AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH ME TO GET HERE -- IT ENSURES THAT THERE IS ACCESSIBLE AND CONVENIENT WAYS TO PAY FOR ALL CUSTOMERS WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY SORT OF MEMBERSHIP. WHILE ALSO GIVING CHARGING STATION PROVIDERS THE FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE THE TYPE OF CARD READER THAT MEETS CONSUMER NEEDS. AND DOES NOT POSE NEGATIVE COST RELIABILITY AND SECURITY IMPLICATIONS. TO REACH OUR STATES GOAL OF THE POINT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE WILL NEED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS. RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ONLY. TWENTY THOUSAND HOWEVER THE EVERY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS RECENTLY ADOPTED A REGULATION MANDATING THAT ALL PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS BE OUTFITTED WITH THE EMV CHIP CREDIT CARD READERS. AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE AIR BEES INTENTIONS THE RECENT CHANGES TO EXTENDED TIME FOR COMPLIANCE THIS REGULATION WOULD SLOW DEPLOYMENT AT A TIME WHEN WE REALLY NEED TO BE REDUCING BARRIERS. THE EMV CHIP READER MANDATE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE COST RELIABILITY AND SECURITY OF CHARGING STATIONS -- AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF YOU CHARGING STATIONS MEANS WILL END UP WITH FEWER CHARGING STATIONS OVERALL. AND TAXPAYER AND REPAIR DOLLARS THE STATE IS INVESTING IN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WILL NOT GO AS FAR. SITE HOSTS THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND RETAILERS WHO HOST CHARGING STATIONS WILL BE SETTLED WITH HIGHER MAINTENANCE COSTS TO COMPLY. A ARBY'S ANALYSIS NOTES THAT THE HARDWARE IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS OF AN EMV CHIP READER. AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND SEVENTY ONE DOLLARS OVER THE CHARGING STATIONS LIFETIME. FOR THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE THE PRICE OF A LEVEL TWO CHARGING STATION ITSELF RANGES FROM THREE TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. OUR LIMITED RESOURCES ARE BEST SPENT DEPLOYING INFRASTRUCTURE EQUITABLY AND EFFICIENTLY TO ENSURE THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA SUPPORTING OUR STATE'S AMBITIOUS. CLINIC GOALS. WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- THE BILL ONE SHORE UNIVERSAL ACCESS AND GIVE PROVIDERS REASONABLE FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THEIR PAYMENT TECHNOLOGIES SECURE. RELIABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE ENABLING US TO CONTINUE ACCELERATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT NEEDED TO MEET OUR STATE SCHOOLS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY OUR FRIEND KNOW WHERE AN OB LA -- TRICKLE WE CHECK CHECK CHECK OUR E. -- TO BE DESERVES WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING OF THANK YOU CHARLIE SO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS UP THE RUSSIA CAN WE I WORK FOR A COMPANY CALLED VOLT ARE CHARGING A BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO. WHEN I AM THE CHAIR OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION -- DISPOSITION IS COMPRISED OF LEADING COMPANIES ARE THE DESIGN MANUFACTURE -- INSTALLING OPERATING MAINTAINING BE CHARGING STATION AND SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE -- THE MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERS HEADQUARTERS IN CALIFORNIA -- UPON FIRST TWO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPEN DIALOGUE -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN HERE IS UNIVERSAL OPEN ACCESS. WE WANT TO READ TO READ TO THAT OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE IF ELECTRIFIED OF VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION. ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO REVIEW CHARGING ACROSS ALL REGIONS AND INCOME LEVELS UP IN THE STATE -- THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN OF NOTED ON EXECUTIVE ORDER BE FORTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN CALLS FOR DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE MILLION. OTHER EMISSION VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY THIRTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TV CHARGERS FOR COMPARISON -- THERE ARE CURRENTLY ON ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED GASOLINE STATIONS IN. CALIFORNIA. SO ACCEPTING CREDIT CARD PAYMENT IS KEY IN ENSURING THAT THIS LARGE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FOR STRUCTURE ALLOWS FOR UNIVERSAL OPEN ACCESS. UP TO ALL THE SINGLE STATEMENT EXPERTS. ARM FOR US OUR MAIN CONCERN IS IS THAT IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IT -- AND AND REALLY IMPORTANT THREE THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS OF DEATH INFRASTRUCTURE GAIL -- DMV READER KEEPS CREATE RELIABILITY ISSUES OF ONE AS AN EXAMPLE -- THE ENVY READERS FOR PARKING METERS OF THE FAILURE RATE OF ABOUT 10% PER YEAR SO. OF A DISCO ON THE COST OF MAINTENANCE ALONE WILL BE ON AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN WHICH WILL SLOW ADOPTION WHICH WE LIMIT. THE THE SCALE AT WHICH WE CAN DEPLOY THIS CHARGING STATION. AND OF COURSE I MEAN DOES COST WITH INDIVIDUAL BE INEVITABLY -- SORRY BE CARRIED ACROSS ALL TO THE AND USERS NOT ONLY IN BACK THE ADOPTION OF FEES -- BUT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES -- TO AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES THAT YOU BE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE BE DEPLOYS ALLOWING UNIVERSAL OPEN ACCESS -- THROUGH UBIQUITOUS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL CREDIT CARD PAYMENT BEANS. WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR FISHING OR MEMBERSHIP AND SO WITH THIS ALTERNATIVE I BE FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR ENSURES THAT -- THE TECHNOLOGY PAYMENT OR PAYMENT THE COLLISION CLEMENTA -- WILL NOT REPRESENT A COST BURDEN THAT WILL NEGATIVELY BACK DEPLOYMENT. ALL IN THIS CONTEXT A HIGH RESPECTIVELY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE'S THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS FRED NO OR REPRESENT THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP AND WE WE SALUTE THE AUTHOR IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE WORK BEING DONE ON A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BECAUSE IT WILL BE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE SERVICE PROVIDERS THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND. TO CONCERT CUSTOMER CHOICE. AND PAYMENT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY OCCUR -- WE SUPPORT THE AMENDMENTS IN MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT THERE BE A ROBUST LIST OF PAYMENT OPTIONS SO ALL COMMUNITIES CAN ACCESS. THESE CHARGING STATIONS AND AND ALSO PROVIDE OUR PLEASED TO HINDER INTER FRAUD AND OTHER -- MEANS WHEN WHEN -- WHEN DEPLOYING THESE TECHNOLOGIES? I AS THE AUTHOR STATED WE HAVE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND DEPLOY -- TO GET TO OUR FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY AS WELL AS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGING STATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN SO MANY WAYS PARTICULARLY IN CLIMATE ACTION WE THINK THIS BILL FITS NICELY INTO THAT. FUNDAMENTAL GOALS SO THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE WE WOULD OUR DRIVER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. FAMILY HAVE ASSEMBLY HAVE MC ALSO IN SUPPORT. CATHERINE BRANDENBURG ONS. ON BEHALF OF CINEMA CLEAN POWER IN SUPPORT. MARK FENCER MAKER FOR POTENTIAL A CLEAN ENERGY MUCH THANKS TO THE AUTHOR IN SUPPORT. KIM DIMITRI WITH TECHNO IN SUPPORT.

IF YOU WANT TO STAY UP MISTER MY NAME IS ROCKY RUSHING -- AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROCKY RUSSIAN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME BEARD DAY FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK GOD STAFF FOR THE VERY COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS. BE GREATLY APPRECIATED -- WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR SHOWING FLEXIBILITY IN ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE BILL MOVES FORWARD ALLOWING. CREDIT CARD READERS TO BE INCLUDED ON THE IN THE THE CARD IS STATIONED. AT JUST ONE POINT OUT AT LAST MONTH'S CAR MEETING -- THE BOARD APPROVED A ESP E. S.. E. V. S. E. PAYMENT STANDARDS THAT INCLUDES AN EMV CARD CHIP READER. WE SHOULD KNOW THAT THE CARBS FINAL PROPOSED REGULATION INCORPORATED COMPROMISES THAT ADDRESS MANY CONCERNS USED TO JUSTIFY THIS BILL INCLUDING. ELIMINATING THE RETROFIT REQUIREMENT FOR EXISTING STATIONS CENTER CORBETT THE AUTHOR OF FORTY FOUR TESTIFIED AT THE CAR HERE AND SAID THAT HER GOAL IS GETTING. SB FOUR FIVE FOUR PASSED WHAT COULD BE DESCRIBED IN ONE WORD THAT ONE WORD IS ACCESS -- UNFORTUNATELY AT AB FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR BY THIS POINT HAS REPRESENTED THE ANTITHESIS OF THAT GOAL. AS WE KNOW THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IMAGE NEARLY HALF OF THE STATE'S GHGS. WE HAVE THE DIRTIEST AIR IN THE NATION MORE PEOPLE DIE FROM TRAFFIC POLLUTION THAN IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND THAT I THINK -- WE'RE WELL PAST THE TIME WHEN. BILLS MOTIVATED BY SELF INTEREST SHOULD BE REJECT REJECTED -- AS YOU KNOW. AT SENATOR -- SB TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN BY CENTER DAILY ON AT ENVISIONED A MARKET FOR EVEY IS THAT NOT JUST A THAT WAS NOT JUST FOR THE TECH SAVVY IN THE WELL HEELED BUT FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- MODERATE PEOPLE OF MODERATE INCOME -- AND THAT. TWELVE SEVENTY FIVE THE STATE FOR THAT BILL WAS SET BY. FOUR FIVE FOUR AND THAT PROVIDED THE FRAMEWORK FOR EVEY CHARGING STATIONS TO OPERATE LIKE GAS STATIONS TO BEST TO SIT ASSIST THE STATE IN REACHING ITS ZEVON GHG A REDUCTION. IN AIR POLLUTION GOALS. IN DRIVERS CAN FILL UP A AT A GAS STATION WITH CHARGE CARDS AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO -- AT CHARGING STATIONS. WITH WITH THAT WE WOULD -- I WOULD CONCLUDE MY REMARKS -- WITH THE FINAL PROVISO THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN USE -- THEIR CHARGE CARDS ADD CHARGING STATIONS AND THAT THE EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE -- INCLUDING EMV EMV. CHIP READER THANK YOU SO MUCH.

SAVED LIVES THEY SIMPLY WEREN'T RESPONDING TO WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF AND THEY WERE RESPONDING TO THE EMERGENCIES THAT NEEDED HELP THE FASTEST. WHILE WE WERE WORKING TO GET RESOURCES INTO THEIR AREA TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THEY NEEDED. WE ALSO AS PUBLIC SAFETY HAVE TO RELY HEAVILY NOW ON THE INTERNET. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER AGENCY IN GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. THE DAYS OF TUNING INTO YOUR LOCAL NEWS AGENCY. ARE GOING THE WAY OF WIRE LE OF WIRE LINE PHONES PEOPLE WANT INFORMATION THEY WANT IT QUICKLY THEY WANTED ACCURATELY AND THEY WANTED IN REAL TIME AND WE RELY HEAVILY ON FACEBOOK. AND TWITTER IN ORDER TO GET INFORMATION OUT TO OUR CITIZENS. WHERE DO WE EVACUATE TO WHETHER TO SHELTER IN PLACE WHAT AREAS TO AVOID WAREHOUSE MATT SITUATIONS ARE OCCURRING? AND AGAIN WITHOUT A ROBUST INTERNET CONNECTION WE ARE HAMPERED IN OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE TO OUR CITIZENS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. AND I HOPE THAT. WE WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND IT WE ALSO ERNESTO FALCON LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION JOINING US. THANK YOU CHAIR WHO IS. VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE IS MY MY NAME'S REST OF TALKING ON THIS SENIOR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION -- WE WERE FOUND IN IN -- NINETEEN NINETY AND RELY ON OUR ENGINEERS ARE LAWYERS AND ARE ACTIVISTS TO DEFEND THE VALUES AND FOCUS AND DEFENDER VALUES AND FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT OUR RATES ARE PER SERVICE AS OUR USE OF TECHNOLOGY GROWS. THE SUCH A PROBLEM BEFORE ALL OF US HERE IS THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION IS NO LONGER IS DOING ITS JOB. THE AGENCY SURRENDERED ITS AUTHORITY OVER BRIBING PROVIDERS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THAT'S CAN ORDER PROMOTE POLICIES THAT IMPACT PRIVACY COMPETITION UNIVERSAL ACCESS NON DISCRIMINATION AND MOST IMPORTANT BEFORE US RIGHT NOW PUBLIC SAFETY. THE FCC ADMITTED TO THE COURTS DURING ITS LITIGATION OVER ITS DECISION TO DEREGULATE THE INDUSTRY BUT IT DID NOT THINK ABOUT HE ISSUE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THAT IT SHOULD DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES AFTER THE FACT. THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY COUNCIL WHO WAS A PARTICIPANT THAT LITIGATION -- RESPONDED THAT IT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING THE REGULATOR SHOULD WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE ARE DEAD BEFORE TAKING ACTION. THERE'S NOTHING COMPLICATED ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION THERE'S NOT BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING COMPLICATED ABOUT WHAT VERIZON DID DURING THE SANTA CLARA FIRES. IN FACT RISING HAS MADE VERY CLEAR BUT THEY WERE IN THE WRONG. WHAT HAPPENED IN SANTA CLARA IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR STATE'S WORST FIRE IN HISTORY HAD NOTHING TO DO OF ENGINEERING AND NOTHING TO DO OF NEVER CAPACITY? AND AND NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING THAT RESEMBLED THE TECHNICAL RATIONALE. THERE WERE NO GOOD REASONS FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS BROADBAND SERVICE TO BE THROTTLE DOWN TO ONE TWO HUNDREDTH OF ITS ORIGINAL SPEED IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY AND THUS RENDERING IT USELESS. SUCH CONDUCT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LEGAL ADVICE HE'S RISO FEDERALLY REGULATED COM CARRIERS AS SUCH IT AS SUCH AND THESE ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN ON JUSTIN ON REGIONAL PRACTICES. NOW I'M NOT SAYING THE RISE IN PLOTTED TO DO HARM OR SCAR SCHEME BUT I'M JUST SAYING IS THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR BALANCING OUT -- PROFIT MOTIVE TO GET OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS PUBLIC SAFETY. MERGE THE OBLIGATIONS OF OFF AND I HAVE OFTEN BEEN A SHARED BURDEN BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INDUSTRIES THAT PROVIDE CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES. AND I DON'T SEE ANY TECHNICAL REASON WHY WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE ABLE TO TO MANAGER SERVICES TO MEET THE GOALS OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND FIVE RISING ALREADY COMMITTED SIMPLY BANDIT FARLEY ALL TOGETHER FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES. GIVEN AT THESE PRICES ARE HEAVILY IN THE PROVINCE OF ENGINEERING AND LEGAL ANALYSIS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE IT'S A LOT IT'S LOGICAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO BE AN OVERSEER -- IN THIS RESPONSE AND IN IT BECAUSE IT'S EASIER ALWAYS QUESTIONS ABOUT REASONABLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS LEGISLATION. AND BELIEVE THAT SO LONG AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS EFFECTIVELY ABANDONED ITS ROLE THAT OVERSEE -- AND PROMOTE THESE AND ADDRESS THESE ISSUES A PUBLIC SAFETY THE THE STATE REALLY HAS TO BE MUCH MORE INVOLVED. IN THESE MATTERS WHERE THE PUBLIC INTEREST COLLIDE TO FOR PROFIT MOTIVE. ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF PUBLIC SAFETY. I LOOK FOR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE OTHER -- THE PERSON'S SUPPORT. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION ANYONE OPPOSITION -- IN SUPPORT MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY.

WE ARE NOT OPPOSING THE CONCEPT WE ARE WORKING ON OF THE MECHANICS OF HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK PROPIEDADES TO MAKE SURE THAT NUMBER ONE THAT THERE'S NO UNDUE CONGESTION IN TIMES OF PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONSE. AND MAKE SURE COMMUNICATIONS AT THAT TIME SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK -- BEFORE THIS GETS TO THE FLOOR HAVE THIS -- AND HAVE THIS THE COMPLETELY COOKED AND BAKED WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THAT LANGUAGE.

B. THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR. CHAIRMAN FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK THEM FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL AB THIRTEEN SIXTY STICK WITH FIX WOULD EXTEND THE PROVISION IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE PRESERVING THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERSIGHT OF VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL. AND INTERNET PROTOCOL ENABLE SERVICES RATHER THAN LETTING THESE POLICY QUESTIONS BE TURNED OVER TO A CUMBERSOME REGULATORY AGENCIES. WOULD ALSO PROVIDE NEW PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS OF THESE SERVICES BY ESTABLISHING A SEVENTY TWO HOUR STANDARD FOR RESTORATION OF SERVICES AFTER REPORTED OUTAGE IN WHICH STEPS TO RESTORE THE SERVICE MUST BE INITIATED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. IT CREATES AN OPTION FOR A BILL CREDIT TO CUSTOMERS WHEN SERVICES NOT BEEN RESTORED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. IT REQUIRES DISCLOSURE REGARDING BACKUP BATTERY NEEDS FOR VOICE AND ALTERNATIVES WHICH EXIST INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO BASIC SERVICE. AND IT REQUIRES THAT IT COMPLAINTS FROM WHITE CUSTOMERS RECEIVE BY THE CPUC BE INCLUDED IN A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR POSSIBLE ENFORCEMENT ACTION. IN TWENTY TWELVE THE LEGISLATURE CODIFIED A POLICY RESERVING ANY STATE REGULATION AVOID AN I. P. ENABLE SERVICES FOR THE LEGISLATURE. SINCE IN CALIFORNIA'S HAVE CONTINUED BENEFITING FROM THE SERVICES WHICH OFFER INNOVATION AND LOW PRICES. FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WERE CALLING HOME MEANS PLACING A CALL TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY I P. ENABLE SERVICES ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF STAYING CONNECTED WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY COSTLY LONG DISTANCE OR INTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE BILLS. HOWEVER THE CLARITY PROVIDE WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY OVER THE SERVICES WILL SENSE THAT JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY UNLESS LEGISLATIVE ACTION HAPPENS NOW. THE LEGISLATURE'S ALSO BEST POISED TO SET POLICY FOR THE SERVICES WE THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN AN AGENCY THAT'S PROVEN ITSELF TOO SLOW. TO ACT IN A TIMELY MANNER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU AND JUST STOPPED MEMBERS -- EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WAS PROVIDED KIND OF AN ATTACHMENT WITH THE AMENDMENTS SORT OF IN PERSON PROPOSED -- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- SO. IF. YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THEM WITH. A WEEK WE CAN GO OVER THEM AT THE REQUEST OF EVERY MEMBER I KNOW SOME MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THEM. WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB SO -- YOU HAVE MEMBERS OF YOUR PRESENTATION IF YOU CAN INTRODUCE THEM. BUT SHEPHERD ON BEHALF OF THE NONPROFIT ALLIANCE ARE PLEASE TO SUPPORT AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX LEGISLATION THAT MAINTAINS THE LEGISLATURE'S CURRENT ROLE IN PROTECTING CONSUMER SAFETY. AND SHIELDS VULNERABLE NON PROFITS FROM UNNECESSARY DATA COST INCREASES AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL THAT SIMPLY REMOVES THE SUNSET ON A LAW THAT DISALLOWED THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. FROM REGULATING THE VOICE AND I PEEN ABLE SERVICES SERVICES THAT ARE VITAL TO NON PROFITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX MAINTAIN ALL CURRENT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND EMPOWERS THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO EXPAND DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS AND RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS. TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY IS PARAMOUNT TO KEEPING THE DOORS OF NON PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA OPEN. NONPROFITS RELY ON ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE DATA IF THE PRICE OF DATA SKYROCKETS AS WE BELIEVE WILL HAPPEN IF THE PC IS ALLOWED TO REGULATE THE INTERNET. CHARITIES WILL HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN ABSORBING THESE COSTS WE IS CONSUMER DATA AND THIRD PARTY DATA PROVIDERS TO ANSWER ENSURE MARKETING MESSAGES ARE DELIVERED TO THOSE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT. WITHOUT AFFORDABLE DATA COSTS NONPROFITS CANNOT EFFECTIVELY CONNECT WITH DONORS CURRENT LAW HAS WORKED WELL ALLOWS FOR CONSUMERS TO BE PROTECTED MEANS MAINTAINS THE LEGISLATURE'S POWER AND AUTHORITY. AND SHIELDS VULNERABLE RATE PAYERS LIKE CHARITIES FROM UNNECESSARY COST INCREASES IF THIS LAWS ALLOWED TO SUNSET WITHOUT FURTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION -- THIS BILL THIS WILL CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIAL FOR COSTLY LITIGATION ON ALL SIDES POTENTIALLY DELAYING FURTHER EXPANSION AND INNOVATION OF THESE SERVICES AS WELL AS CREATING LIFE. REAL LIFE COST PRESSURES THAT CAN CAUSE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY FOR THOSE WITH NO PROFIT MARGIN TO ABSORB THE NEW COSTS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I THOUGHT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ON BURNS DEAN I COULD PUT THE MICHAEL OF THE CLOSER SO WE CAN CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH I MEAN I LOVE THE CLOSER WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK -- AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE OVEN CHORUS SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB AB. THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX AT THE OPEN CALL WE SERVE AS A BRIDGE TO A BETTER LIFE FOR YOUNG ADULTS AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY SIX WE PROVIDE PAID JOB TRAINING. A SECOND CHANCE TO IN HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. AS I SAID OUR ORGANIZATION SAYS IS A BRIDGE TO A BETTER LIFE FOR YOUNG ADULTS THAT'S WHY I AM HERE TODAY. NEW INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES ARE HELPING CREATE THAT FISH FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE WE SERVE. AND I WANT TO SEE THAT CONTINUE. ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS VITAL FOR THE YOUNG ADULTS WHO SERVE IN SAN DIEGO I USED TO USE THE INTERNET TO STAY CONNECTED TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. ACCESS HEALTHCARE. EDUCATION JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER RESOURCES. AND I KNOW THE POLICY IN PLACE TODAY IS WORKING AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXTEND. OUR CALL MEMBERS ONLY USE MOBILE PHONES TABLETS AND OTHER SERVICES THESE TECHNOLOGIES OF VITAL AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT POPULAR BECAUSE THAT IS A FREE. LOW LOW COST OVER THE AFFORDABLE. THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE IMPROVING THE LIVES OF LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED CALIFORNIANS. WE'VE ALL HAD JUST SORT OF LESS THAN PERFECT EXPERIENCES Và SOME OF THE LARGER AGENCIES MANAGING TECHNOLOGY -- AND TODAY WE DON'T HAVE AGOVERNMENT AGENCY PUTTING ITSELF BETWEEN PEOPLE IN THESE AND THESE CHOICES. SO MY OPINION THIS IS A SUCCESS ON MAKING THE MORE EXPENSIVE OR HARD TO ACCESS WOULD BE A STEP BACKWARD. BECAUSE OF THIS I HOPE YOU WAS SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN FAVOR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BILL DIVINE REPRESENTING EIGHTY ATI WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU.

CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. CHICAGO WITH **** COMMUNICATIONS AND SUPPORT. CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. CORNELIA FISHERMEN MEMBERS MICHAEL DOUBLE THE CALIFORNIA RANGE LAND TRUST ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BUT SHEPHERD AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION OF TO THE BILL GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN HOST AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM TOM RUNYON AND I'M PROUD TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT OF CW A DISTRICT NINE REPRESENTING OVER SIXTY THOUSAND MEMBERS. IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS OUR WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. HAVE BEEN HEARING DIRECTLY FROM CONSUMERS REGARDING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR PHONE SERVICE. OUR MEMBERS OF ALSO WITNESS SAFETY. ISSUES WITH PHONE LINES THAT HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED TO THE LACK OF PROPER OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION. UNFORTUNATELY OUR WORKERS DO NOT SEE THESE ISSUES GETTING ANY BETTER. WITHOUT THE STATE INTERVENTION SOMETHING THAT CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS. THE DE REGULATION AVOID TELEPHONE SERVICE UNDER SB ELEVEN SIXTY ONE HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT CAPS IN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. TRADITIONAL LANDLINE TELEPHONE CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE CP YOU SEE. AND THE COMMISSION CAN TAKE ACTION. THEY CAN BE SURE THAT OUTAGES WILL BE RETORED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. THEY CAN ASSUME THEIR CALLS WILL BE ANSWERED IN A REASONABLE TIME. UNFORTUNATELY V<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; USERS HAVE&lt;/c&gt;</u> NO SUCH ASSURANCES. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX ONLY OFFERS LESSER OR NO PROTECTIONS. CW A TECHNICIANS WORKING IN THE FIELD SEE THE DISPARITY FIRST HAND THEY PRIORITIZE RESTORING TRADITIONAL PHONE SERVICE WALL BOY CUSTOMERS ARE LEFT WAITING. THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT MOST CUSTOMERS HAVE NO IDEA THEY HAVE BEEN SWITCHED TO AVOID. SERVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE UNLIKE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THE MAJORITY OF HOME PHONE SERVICE WOULD NOW BE COVERED BY THE PROVISIONS OF AB. THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX CW A HAS LONG SUPPORTED POLICIES AND PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS AND WHOLE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICE. BY EXTENDING THE PROVISIONS OF SB. ELEVEN SIXTY ONE UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX WOULD ENSURE THAT MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE WORKERS HAVE IDENTIFIED BECOME FURTHER ENTRANCE. THIS WOULD GIVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES A FURTHER REASON TO IGNORE THE NEEDS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. NOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF PHONE PHONE CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ON VOICE WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS SWITCHING OVER MORE PEOPLE EVERY DAY. IT IS TIME THAT THE STATE ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS DO NOT LOSE THE PROTECTIONS THEY ENJOYED UNDER THEIR PREVIOUS PHONE SERVICE. THE DEFEAT OF AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX WILL RESTORE CRITICAL PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY -- PROTECTIONS AS WELL IF YOU PASS THIS BILL YOU ARE TELLING MILLIONS OF RESIDENTS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL NOT PROTECT THEM. E. W. A AND ITS MEMBERS HAVE SEEN THE PROBLEMS FIRST HAND AND BELIEVE IT IS TIME FOR THE C. P. U. C. AND THE STATE TO TAKE BACK THEIR AUTHORITY. TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS WE STRONGLY URGE THAT YOU OPPOSE AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WESSEL SENATORS. MY NAME IS MARTIN WAS MINUS SEVEN ASSIGNMENT COMMISSIONER AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AT OUR LAST PUBLIC MEETING THE COMMISSION VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE STATE HAS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN ENSURING ACCESS TO SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE REGARDLESS OF TECHNOLOGY. FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS THE TRUMP FCC HAS ERODED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. YET THIS BILL PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE ALL STATE JURISDICTION AND LEAVE THE PROVISIONS OF THE CENTRAL ACCESS TO THE SEC AND THE FREE MARKET. AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE MAP THAT I ASK -- THE SERGEANT TO HAND TO YOU WE KNOW THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DO NOT BENEFIT FROM ANY COMPETITION IN THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET PLACE. THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE NO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND ACCESS AND A THIRTY CALIFORNIANS THIRTEEN MILLION APPROXIMATELY DO NOT BENEFIT FROM ANY COMPETITION. THIS IS AN OLIGOPOLY IT'S NOT A FREE MARKET. THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE STATE FROM GUARANTEE AN ESSENTIAL AND RELIABILITY COMMUNICATION SERVICES TO ALL CALIFORNIANS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN UPGRADED. IT WILL ELIMINATE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE INFRASTRUCTURE ACCESS TO RULE CALIFORNIANS TO THE DEATH TO THE DISABLED AND TO THE POOR. WITHIN IT COMES. THE STATE IS NOT THIS THIS BASICALLY IS ONLY BECAUSE THEY'VE CHANGED INTERNET PROTOCOL SERVICES IN THE STATE IS NOT INTERESTED IN ENSURING UNIVERSAL ACCESS. THE BILL IS NOT ABOUT STIPPLING INNOVATION OR APPS LIKE SKYPE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT DEREGULATING THE COMPANIES THAT OWN AND MANAGE THE POLLS WIRES AND RADIOS IN CALIFORNIA. COMPANIES LIKE COMCAST IN EIGHTEEN T. NOT THESE APPS. UNDER THIS BILL THESE COMPANIES WILL BE LEFT TO THEIR OWN SENSE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY NOT GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT. THEIR OWN DECISION MAKING ON WHAT THE CRITICAL ISSUES SHOULD BE. WHETHER THEY SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN UNIVERSAL SERVICE PROGRAMS LIKE LIFELINE. EIGHTEEN ANTI THE STATE'S LARGEST CARRIER HAS DECREASED ITS PARTICIPATION BY THEY'LL DECIDE WHICH COMMUNITIES RECEIVE THE NEXT GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FIBER LIKE FIVE G. LIKE TEN G.. THEY'LL DECIDE WHETHER OR HOW QUICKLY INFRASTRUCTURE IS REPAIRED OR UP CREATED IMPORT COMMUNITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. THEY'LL DECIDE WHETHER THE ADDRESS COMPLAINTS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THEY'LL DECIDE WHERE THEY BUILD WHILE FIRE PROOF AND DISASTER RESILIENCY INTO THEIR CORE INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE SERVICE THEY PROVIDE IS RELIABLE AND REDUNDANT SO ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN REACH NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHERS AT ALL TIMES. THEY WILL DECIDE WHETHER THEY COORDINATE WITH THE I'LL USE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PREPARE FOR DISASTERS TO RESPOND DISASTERS TO RECOVER FROM DISASTERS. THESE ISSUES ARE FUNDAMENTAL THEY ARE TOO IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO ABANDON ITS ROLE IN. FIRE SEASON IS HERE AGAIN. AND WHILE THE STATE HAS SCRUTINIZED OTHER UTILITIES FOR THE RELIABILITY DURING INCREASINGLY DIM DEVASTATING DISASTERS. IT HAS NOT DONE SO FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. YET WHILE FIRE ANOTHER DISASTER PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE EVACUATION AND RECOVERY HINGES ON A RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS GRID. AND IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR ALL UTILITIES IT'S THE BACKBONE FOR POWER IT'S THE BACKBONE FOR WATER AND OF COURSE FOR COMMUNICATIONS. THERE ARE TOO MANY COMMUNITIES AND HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES WITH REAL CONCERNS THAT THEY WILL BE THE NEXT KOFI PARK OR PARADISE. WE NEED TO KNOW IF THEIR NETWORKS HAVE BACKUP POWER DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND REDUNDANT BACK CALL. THAT THERE ARE MERGING SEE PREPAREDNESS PLANS THAT LOCAL RESPOND TO RESPOND HERS KNOW WHERE THEIR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS TO INCORPORATE INTO THEIR RESPONSE PLANS RECOVERY. WE MUST IDENTIFY STRENGTHEN AND PROTECT THE VULNERABLE PARTS OF OUR NETWORKS BECAUSE BRINGING IN TEMPORARY FACILITIES ON WHEELS OR WINGS WILL ALWAYS BE TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. THE COMMISSION HAS LOOKED EARNESTLY TO REPAIR CALIFORNIA WHETHER WE SOUGHT TO ADOPT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF DISASTERS. TO REQUIRE UTILITIES TO PREPARE FOR DISASTERS IN RESPONSE OR TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS FOR D. ENERGIES ATION EVENTS AND THIS STATUTE HAS BEEN THE BARRIER TO ENACTING UNIFORM PROCEDURES ACROSS ALL UTILITIES. WE KNOW THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR SERVICE QUALITY REPORTING. WITH SADDAM SANTA ROSA AND IN PARADISE AND IN OUR NETWORK EXAM OF EIGHTEEN TO YOUR FRONTIERS NOW QUIRK FROM. TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS EXAM SHOWS. WHETHER DELIBERATE OR NOT THE EIGHTEEN ANTI INVESTMENTS INVESTMENT POLICIES HAVE FAVORED HIGHER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND HAVE THUS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT UPON THE STATE'S LOWEST INCOME AREAS. WE FOUND A CLEAR INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND ALL THE PRINCIPLE SERVICE QUALITY METRICS. CNETRIC NETWORK HUBS. WITH THE LOWEST HOUSEHOLD INCOMES HAVE THE HIGHEST TROUBLE REPORT RATES THEY HAVE THE LONGEST OUT OF SERVICE DURATIONS THEY HAVE THE LOWEST PERCENTAGES OF OUTAGES CLEARED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE FOR THE HIGHEST INCOME COMMUNITIES. THIS LAW HAS CAUSED HARM BY PREVENTING ACCESS TO GRADING THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE PROGRAMS AND PREVENTING PREPAREDNESS AND RESILIENCY. IT SHOULD SUNSET CALIFORNIANS NEED THEIR GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT TEY HAVE RELIABLE COMMUNICATIONS AND THIS LAW PREVENTS THE MODERNIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS NEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. IS MIKE POWER THERE. IS A BRONZE WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE AND WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. KARAGIAS SANDERS REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FORMALLY THE OFFICER REPAIR ADDICTS ADVOCATES WE REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSED TO HIS FELLOW GIVEN THAT 50% OF THE POPULATION.

STANCE ON TO SOME OF THE TECHNICIAN WITH EIGHTEEN TNC W. EIGHT REPRESENTATIVE. BUT I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. LARGE GROUPS OF FARMWORKERS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. CAN BE AFFECTED VERY NEGATIVELY BY THIS THANK YOU. IF YOU'RE NOT BECAUSE THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA LOCAL. NINE THOUSAND THREE AND ALSO DISTRICT NINE OPPOSE. ANY OTHER SPEAKERS OF THE WOULD LIKE. PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN THIS BILL SUPPORT. OPPOSITION WINNERS [inaudible] OKAY UP. IN ON THIS BILL THERE ARE STRONG ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES -- BOTH COMING FROM -- OUR STATES REGULATORY AGENCIES AND CONSUMER ADVOCATES BUT ALSO. FROM THE INDUSTRY. THAT MAKES CLAIMS THAT JOB THIS IS CREATED MORE COMPETITION AND OUR THAT OUR OUR REGULATORY SYSTEM. OFTEN TAKES. YEARS TO DELIBERATE BECAUSE IN. ENORMOUS HARM TO OF TO THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY. TO STAY INNOVATIVE. AND WE'RE THE INNOVATION STATE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND INNOVATION. I ALSO YOU KNOW IN IN THIS BILL -- THAT WAS ORIGINALLY. PAST IT WAS A OF A REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT -- THE CPC THAT REQUIRED THE CPUC REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON COMPLAINTS. AND THAT HAS BEEN AN AREA WHERE THE CQC ALSO HAS BEEN. SOMEWHAT LACKEY IN REPORTING TO THE THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE ARE OF COURSE ARE A REGULATORY AGENCY IN THAT IS -- FUNCTIONS VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IN GETTING US TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER. THERE ARE A COMPLAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAM. AND SO WE THOUGHT IN IN IN. IN HEARING KIND OF THE TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPOSITION AND ALSO FROM THE SUPPORTERS THAT WE FIND A WAY TO STRIKE A HEALTHY BALANCE THAT ADVOCATES FOR CONSUMERS. THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE NEEDS. THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT -- YES WE WE CONSULTED -- YES TO SEE HOW WE CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. SHOW OF THE OUR OUR OUR OUR AUTHOR HERE TODAY HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS. THE AMENDMENTS WILL CLARIFY THAT -- YES HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE SERVICES AND THAT OF COURSE IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE ESPECIALLY WITH THE STATE FACING WILDFIRES AND AND AN INCREASED NEED FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. HOW WE -- WORKED WITH -- YES TO DEVELOP. THE THIS LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE. AUTHORITY. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE. ARE ARE PROVIDED WITH THE ABILITY. TO HOW TO RESPOND A IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES. ALSO OF WE AMENDED THE BILL SUNSET DATE. THE TWO FIVE YEARS AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL NOT IMPOSE AN UNDUE BURDEN ON CPUC TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS. TO REPORT COMPLAINTS -- WE WE EXPANDED. WE WHAT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE I WORKED A LITTLE BIT MORE ON EXPANDING THE ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE WE ASKED OF THE SEA OF PEACE. A CPUC. WHICH INCLUDE REQUIRE THE CPC DUE TO REPORT COMPLAINTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REQUIRE THE CPC TO ANNUAL REPORT. ON THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THE NUMBER OF RESOLVE COMPLAINTS IN THE AVERAGE DURATION. FOR COMPLETE RESOLUTION BASED ON REPORTS FROM TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS HAVING THIS INFORMATION IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE. THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES RESPOND ARE RESPONSIVE. TO CONSUMER COMPLAINTS WE ALSO HAVE A REPORTING REQUIREMENT INFORMING CONSUMERS. THAT IF THEY HAVE ANY COMPLAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR SERVICE THEIR BILL THEIR QUALITY THAT THEY SHOULD. REPORT THAT TO THE C. P. YOU SEE. THAT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT'S INCLUDING THIS BILL. THAT WILL INFORM PEOPLE WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE ASKED CONSUMERS AND TO WHAT MECHANISM THEY NEED. TO FOLLOW THROUGH SO THEY CAN. GET THERE ARE COMPLAINTS RESOLVED. THAT WILL OF HOPEFULLY BE OF A A OF A VERY STRONG REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ARE. ARE WORKING HARD TO SATISFY THEIR CUSTOMERS. IT ALSO RECALL. BE SEATED IN FIND TRENDS IN CONSUMER COMPLAINTS OF PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE. WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDRESSING THESE. THESE TRENDS SO WHERE WERE ASKING TO SEE IF YOU SEE WE'RE GONNA ASSN FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD SHOULD BE ADOPTED INTO LAW. TO WORK WITH US IN THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD WE SEE A RISE IN CONSUMER COMPLAINTS OR TREND IN CERTAIN CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. OR CERTAIN TRENDS IN. IN IN TELL ME ISSUE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AVOIDING SERVICE IN CERTAIN AREAS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT AND WE ARE WE ARE PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT WE ARE PARTNERS IN REGULATORY EFFORT WE DO. WE DIDN'T WE NEED TO SEE IF YOU SEE A PART BE A PARTNER IN EFFORT TO PROVIDE. THIS INFORMATION. TO THE LEGISLATURE. IT ALSO ARE THE BILL THERE ARE AMENDMENTS WOULD REMOVE IT EXEMPTIONS FROM AN ESTABLISHED ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PORTIONS OF THE BILL. ESTABLISHING BACK OF POWER NOTIFICATION. BILL CREDIT AND SERVICE RESTORATION REQUIREMENTS. AND THE FINAL ONE IS -- AN AMENDMENT. THERE'S TWO MORE WONDER LIMITS CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN PASSED CPUC DECISIONS AND ALSO. A CLARIFICATION THE CDC HAS AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH AN OF COURSE KOHLER. AND BASIC SERVICE REQUIREMENTS ON THE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL BASIS. WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON THESE AMENDMENTS AND WORK VERY HARD TO ENSURE THESE AMENDMENTS. WILL HAVE THE TEETH NECESSARY TO ADVOCATE FOR NOT ONLY V. THE THE CONSUMERS. BUT OF FOR OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL THAT ARE WORKING VERY HARD. TO BE RESPONSIVE IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES AND WE BELIEVE. THAT UNLESS WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE THIS IS A OF A REALLY GOOD IT OF START TO CONTINUE ON WITH. OF PROGRAM THAT APPEARS TO HAVE. BEEN WORKING IN. A SO FAR. AND STILL OF FIND THAT BALANCE AS I MENTIONED ON FOR PROVIDING THIS CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH CENTER RUBIO. IF YOU LIKE TO EXAMINE SORT OF QUESTIONS WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO YOU KNOW COMMANDED THE CHAIR BECAUSE I KNOW HIM AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE AND TO THE AUTHOR ALSO BRINGING OF OVER. FORWARD AND ACCEPTING IMMENSE -- I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN OR AT LEAST TALK VERY BRIEFLY WITH COMMISSIONER WAS MINE AND I HEARD HER CONCERNS AS WELL AS ALL THE THE WORK -- CW A AND I THINK THIS WAS A BILL THAT WAS WASN'T EASY BUT I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE INDUSTRY WHO SAT WITH US I HAD A FEW PEOPLE LATE LAST NIGHT IN MY OFFICE AND WERE WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALLOW FOR INNOVATION AND GROWTH AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WAS REALLY AT THE HEART OF OUR DISCUSSIONS. EVERY SINGLE DAY AND DIE WITH ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE READ RIGHT HERE I THINK THAT FOR NOW IT STRIKES THAT MIDDLE GROUND WHERE WERE ABLE TO AT LEAST. EXTENDED A FEW YEARS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS MONITOR THE THE INDUSTRY AND ENSURE THAT THOSE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE WORKING AND OUR ABLE TO TOPPLE THE ISSUES THAT ARISE I KNOW TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING. BY FAST EXPONENTIALLY JUST AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE POTS ONCE IN AWHILE TO CHECK IN AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT IT'S WORKING. BUT FOR NOW I'M REALLY PLEASE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN AND CUTTING IT DOWN FROM TEN YEARS TO FIVE I GET SIGNIFICAN AND BOTH. TRYING TO HELP THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS TAKING ALL THE CONCERNS OF THE WORKERS AND CONSUMERS -- AND I ALSO WANT TO THINK THAT CONSUMER ADVOCATES WILL ALSO SAT WITH ME AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES -- I THINK THAT WE HAVE AND THE CHAIR HOUSE. RELEASE CERTAINLY -- COME TO THE MIDDLE AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT BALANCE AND I WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTING THE SPELL BUT I WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THE HOURS THAT WENT INTO. TRYING TO FIND THAT MIDDLE GROUND AND TO SO THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BEING IN A FORD AND TO THE CHAIR FOR FOR ALSO ACCEPTING YOU KNOW CONCERNS AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT GAVE HIM A TOP AND WITH THAT I WILL ALSO BE. SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHICH ONE YEAH. BUT THANK YOU MISTER SURE THANK YOU SIMILAR FOR BRAINS FORD IBM. THE STAFF THE LAST TIME THIS BILL THE LEGISLATURE MISTER THE AND THE WORLD'S CHANGED SOMEWHAT SINCE THEN -- TECHNOLOGY YES BUT THIS FIRE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THE ESSENCE OF MY CONCERNED THAT'S SORT OF WHERE I'VE BEEN LASER FOCUS SO. I'M REVIEWING THESE AMENDS IT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE MADE. SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON THAT FRONT BUT I I WILL. TRYING TO GET A LITTLE MORE CLARITY WHEN TURN TURN TESTIFIED STILL WORRIED ABOUT WILDFIRE ISSUES -- I DON'T KNOW IF. IF IT'S THREE YOU OR THE CHAIR OR TALKING EIGHTEEN TEA BAGS. I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE ON THIS BACKUP POWER ISSUE JURISDICTION ONLY WHAT. YOU SEE WE THINK CAN DO OR WHAT ROLE CARILLO YES MAY PLAY. IN MAKING SURE THAT. THE ENERGY IS ASIAN AND DURING WILDFIRES VULNERABLE PEOPLE DON'T GET. STOCK IS THAT'S A LIFELINE AND SO. I'M I JUST I GOT TO GET SOME REASSURANCE ON THAT AND MAY WE CAN WALK THROUGH THE A MAN'S OR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT -- AND THIS WAS OUR CONCERN. FROM THE LOOK THIS WAS NOT EASY BILL FOR ME TO TAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE -- I HAVE NEVER. THAT MAKES MY LABOR PARTNERS AND THE BILL I'VE DONE. WHAT I'M HOWEVER? WE THINK THAT BY PROVIDING EXPLICIT DIRECTIONS SO WITH -- YES BEING ABLE TO TO MAKE THE NINE ONE ONE I'M CHANGES ANYTHING TO NINE ONE ONE THAT THAT'S GOOD THAT'S A START WHAT WE ACTUALLY THINK. WE'LL MOVE FASTER THAN IT WOULD IF WE LEFT IT UP TO YOU SEE. I'M WE ALSO THINK OF COURSE WHERE WE'RE NOT GIVING UP THE POWER THE LEGISLATURE TO MANDATE ANYTHING AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN PROVISIONS ROUTE THIS BILL THEY THINK WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT. I'M MUCH MORE CLEAR FOR CONSUMERS THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE TOLD THEIR RIGHTS TO HAVE BASIC LINE SERVICE -- WE ARE NO WAY MOVING AWAY FROM BASIC LINES SERVICE WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR. I'M NOT ONLY THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BASICALLY IN SERVICE THAT WITH BOYS IF THEY LOSE THEIR POWER THE DATE WITHOUT BACKUP GENERATION THEY WILL LOSE THEIR TELEPHONE SERVICE. SO THAT IS. AN ADDITIONAL I THINK CONSUMER PROTECTION AND A PROTECTION FOR THOSE SPECIALLY WILDFIRE AREAS TO UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PGA OF COURSE TALK ABOUT -- PLANNED BLACKOUTS ARE IF YOU WILL OR OR I I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO COMBAT -- THREE THAT THAT CONSUMER SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MEANS YOUR PHONE WON'T WORK UNLESS YOU HAVE BACKUP POWER I'M IN AND I THINK THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOES THAT EXTENDS THAT IN A MUCH QUICKER WAY THAN IF WE JUST SIMPLY LEFT IT UP TO THE UC TO CREATE SOME -- NEW -- TO CALL AND SO -- THOSE ARE THE THINGS WERE SEEKING ANSWERS MORE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK ITH YOU IS THIS MISS FORD WE'VE BEEN ASKING ALONG THE WAY WHAT ELSE IS IT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS NOT. THAT THEY SHOULD GO ON REGULATED WE'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THE REGULATION SO THIS ACTUALLY GETS PUT IN PLACE IN ENOUGH TIME TO AFFECT THOSE CONSUMERS THAT WE KNOW -- NEED TO BE EFFECTIVE NOW I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RESTORATION -- SERVICE THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I ASKED FOR BECAUSE THAT THAT THAT'S ONE OF THINGS LACKING WITH WITH -- VOICE OF COURSE YOU KNOW WITH YOUR LAND LINE YOU HAVE SOME SOME PROVISIONS THAT THAT ENSURE YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR LAND LINE BACK IF IT GETS KNOCKED OUT WE HAVE THAT NOW SO. WE'RE TAKING WHAT WAS THE STATUS QUO MAKING IT MUCH BETTER AND ALSO TAKING INPUT FROM FOLKS LIKE YOU ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO SAY WE NEED ADDITIONALLY -- THIS INFORMATION IN THIS BILL I'M SO THAT WE ARE. DOING OUR PROPER ROLE I THINK IT LEGISLATING THESE THINGS INTO -- INTO EXISTENCE RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THE REGULATORY SCHEME TO TAKE ITS TIME WHICH WE ALL KNOW I I MEAN I HAVE A LIST OF EXAMPLES OF HOW LONG THE P. YOU SEE HAS TAKEN ON A NUMBER O THINGS -- AND WE CAN'T WAIT EIGHT YEARS WE CAN'T WAIT TEN YEARS YOU KNOW SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING IF THERE'S MORE AS YOU GO THROUGH IT IN AS THIS GOES HOPEFULLY TOOK RELATIONS. WERE WERE OPEN OKAY ADDING TO IT HELPS -- WHEN YOU SAY? MAYBE EVEN A PC I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE REVIEWED THE A MAN'S OR WHAT THEY THINK THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO VERSUS CALLOW YES BUT YOU'RE SAYING NOW WE HAVE. TO THEY'D HAVE TO GO NOTIFY CUSTOMERS THAT THEY'RE THEY COULD LOSE POWER. BUT DOES IT ACTUALLY AUTHORIZE ANYONE EITHER CALLOW YES OR THE P. YOU SEE TO MANDATE THAT THE TELCOS OR THE CABLE FOLKS ACTUALLY SUPPLY THAT POWER OR DOES IT JUST SAY. HEY HEADS UP POWER GOES DOWN YEARS YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A USE THE PHONE IT JUST REQUIRES THE TELCOS TO TELL THE CONSUMERS THAT SO IF WE WANTED A MANAGED EIGHTEEN OF BACK POWER THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAVE TO ADD TO IT. TWO CAN CAN I JUST GET A QUICK PIECE OF FEEDBACK HERE DO YOU MIND. CHAIR JUST. TO BE CLEAR I JUST GOT THE AMENDMENT I'M SO I'M WRESTLING WITH THEM. TOO I BELIEVE YOU CONCEPTUALLY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO AND I DON'T. KNOW NOTIFICATIONS THE INTENT. YOUR VIEW IS YOU NEED ME MORE EXPRESSIVE STORY TO SAY NO YOU YOU'VE GOT A BACK UP THESE VULNERABLE THAT'S NOT IN THE BILL CURRENTLY I GUESS -- YES COULD DECIDE THAT WITH THEIR NINE ONE ONE NEXT GEN BUT WE WOULD ACTUALLY IF WE WANT THAT WE NEED TO PUT IT IN THE BILL OKAY. WOULD YOU SEE THAT THE SAME ARE NINE I ALSO JUST SAW THEM -- ELECTRONICALLY AS WELL BUT IN YOUR UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR READ. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH -- YES -- YES IS -- RESPONDED TO YOUR MERGING SEIZE THEIR NINE ONE ONE NETWORK IS FOR THE NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY RESPONSE NETWORK. IS NOT FOR THE COMMUNITY FACILITY IT'S NOT FOR THE RESIDENT. I SAW FOR THE RESILIENCY OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY WHAT WE NEED IS THE SAME SERVICE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS AND RESILIENCY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE CAN. PROVIDE FOR THE OLD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S NOT ANYTHING BEYOND THAT IS BEING ABLE TO CALL I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIERTHAT WE HAVE CALLED THE MEETING FOR THIS TYPE OF PREPAREDNESS INTO PAYING A CANYON. WE COULDN'T EVEN CALL IT REQUIRE ALL THE CARRIERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT. THIS IS A VERY BASIC REQUIREMENTS IT'S BEYOND THE NINE ONE ONE TERRACE THE NINE ONE CHERUB IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE'RE VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT BEING ADDRESSED. WE NEED TO WORK ON THE NETWORK STRUCTURE THERE IS RELIABLE INCLUDING THE RESILIENCY OF BACKUP POWER [inaudible] SO. IN A VERSION FROM YOU TO WORKING ON THAT ISSUE. I'M HERE I WILL WORK ON ANY ISSUE -- I I THINK. IN I MEAN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT COMMISSIONER IT'S AT WE JUST WANT TO ENSURE THAT WHAT WE DO GETS DONE IT GETS DONE NOW IF THAT MAKES SENSE -- AND AND I YOU KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE FOR WHATEVER'S NECESSARY. I I REALLY -- PREFERRED I HAD THE WELL I CAN SEE WHY YOU NEED BACK UP POWER AS WELL BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. I'M YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND CONSTITUENTS IT LIVE IN AN AREA THAT IS. SUBJECT ALL THESE THINGS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY STILL HAVE A RIGHT TO BASIC SERVICE AND WHY THAT THAT RIGHT IS SO IMPORTANT -- IN WHICH CASE IF THEY BASIC SERVICE IT GETS BACK TO BEING REGULATED OF COURSE -- BY THE PC SO PART OF MY GOAL I THINK AND ACCEPT DEAN -- THIS BILL TO TAKE IT ON INTO AYE. TO EXTEND THE SUNSET -- WIT WHICH IT IT'S NOT A BILL I USUALLY WOULD DO IS TO ENSURE THAT -- ON A VARIETY OF GROUNDS I THINK IT'S IT'S M.. A CHANGE OF PACE OF HOW WE'VE SEEN THE COMPANIES GO AWAY FROM BASIC SERVICE IN -- MAYBE AT AN UNDERSTANDING OF A NEW WORLD WHERE CONSUMERS MADE ME THAT EXPLANATION OF WHY THAT WOULD BE SO IMPORTANT FOR THEM IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE. TO UTILIZE THAT BASIC SERVICE RATHER THAN RELYING ON ON VOIGTS FURTHER ON SERVICE. SO ALL I WOULD JUST ASK FOR FOR MEDIA COME THROUGH THE VOTE TODAY IS. I TRUST YOUR WORD I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THIS AND IT IS A TOUGH ONE BUT JUST. COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS NOT JUST NOTIFICATION THAT A YOU MAY LOSE SERVICE AND THE ENERGY IS ATION EARN WILDFIRE BUT AN ACTUAL. AUTHORITY AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT ENTITY. A WHETHER YOU SEE -- E. S. WHAT THE RIGHT ENTITIES BUT A REQUIREMENT TO DO THAT BACK UP WORK NOT JUST SOMETHIN SAYING HEY HE MAY FALL GOOD LUCK. RIGHT RIGHT NOW ABSOLUTELY IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU YOU WANT MOVING FORWARD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AND I'M. TO TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE APPROPRIATE PLACE SAYS -- AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE WE HAVE ENFORCEMENT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO THERE THERE'S A NUMBER OF PLACES I THINK WE COULD LOOK AT LEAST AMOUNT THANK YOU THAT MEANS A LOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SEE SOMEONE CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE ABOUT -- INVEST INVESTMENTS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITY AND I ALSO HEARD. ADJOURNMENT TALK ABOUT THE RURAL COMMUNITIES CAN. CAN YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF HOW WE'RE GONNA TACKLE THIS ISSUE IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING SERVICE. AND THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF BILLS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO TO TRY TO GET AT THAT. AND I THINK THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE -- IN ORDER TO AT IT HASN'T HAPPENED WHAT'S HAPPENED MORE THAN WE GIVE IT CREDIT TO ACTUALLY -- ACCESS TO SERVICES IS MUCH BROADER I THINK AND THEN ALL OF US REALIZE BUT SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON I I KNOW I THINK BOTH OF US HAVE BEEN CO AUTHOR SOME BILLS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO EXPAND THAT KIND SERVICE IN TO WORK ON THAT LEGISLATIVELY DOESN'T PREVENT US FROM DOING THAT ANYWAY. AND TOWN WELL LASTLY I'M I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE I'M HEARING IN YOUR CONCERNS BERMAN IS -- GOES MAN AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE RESTORATION GUARANTEE IS THERE THAT IT'S SOLID AND THERE'S NO LOOPHOLES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN. FOR SOME ODD CONSUMERS AS WELL AS RELIABLE QUALITY SERVICE AND SELL. AND YOU CAN SURE THAT THIS IS WHAT TO HAVE IT'S DEFINITELY BETTER THAN THE CURRENT LAW SO THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR US RATE OF SERVICES CURRENTLY WE PUT. FOR VOICE THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT WAS I HEARD THAT LOUD AND CLEAR FROM FROM CW A EMPLOYEES WHO AT THAT'S A PROBLEM I MEAN YOU COULD CALL AND CALL AND THERE IF YOU HAVE NO. DEADLINES RIGHT -- BUT THERE IS FOR BASIC SERVICES SO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THE EXACT TWENTY FOUR HOURS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE TYPE IN AND WHAT. WHAT THEY HAVE TO FIND I'M SO WE DID A SEVENTY TWO HOUR WITH ENFORCEMENT BEING TO THE AG I'D BE HAPPY -- TO STRENGTH AND THAT I I I A WOULD BE AS I CONTINUE AND I WORKED -- WITH WITH. THE OPPONENTS AND CONTINUES A WHAT ELSE IS IT THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THIS BETTER WITH OUT. I AM THE ONE THING WITH THAT IS WE'RE NOT GIVING IT WE'RE NOT SAYING OKAY FINE FORGET IT WILL JUST GIVE YOU SEE ARE NOT RUNNING THE BILL BASICALLY. OUTSIDE OF THAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO HAVE A FRAMEWORK THAT WORKS FOR CONSUMERS PASSED IN SO I'LL CONTINUE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU -- ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S STRONG ENOUGH. THANK YOU AND AND AGAIN I THINK THAT THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT THIS THE MORE I SEE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE AND THAT'S ALL THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS REALLY APPRECIATE IT. IF POSSIBLE JUST ON THE RESTORATION QUESTIONS THAT'S SHOWING US YOUR NAME IS A WE HAVE THE CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA ALSO. SEE TO BE A DESERVE NINE AND AND TURN ON THE RESTORATION IN THE REVIEW OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE SAW -- THIS MORNING OR THIS AFTERNOON -- IT IS IMPORTANT NOTICE THAT THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT APPEARS TO BE AN EXEMPTION -- FORM THE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR NOTICE AND SEE TWO HOURS OF RESTORING SERVICE -- WHAT IT STATES IS THAT IF THE QUOTE PROVIDER IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO A RESTORATION REQUIRE THAT REQUIREMENT IS SIMILAR OR THE SAME? THEN THE REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL DON'T APPLY. THAT COULD BE READ TO MEAN THAT A PROVIDER LIKE EIGHTEEN T. WHICH IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO RESTORATION FOR ITS COPPER LAND LINES WOULDN'T THEN NOT BE SUBJECT. TO THIS LANGUAGE IT DOES NOT SAY THAT THE STRONGER STANDARD APPLIES. BOARD SAY THAT THE STANDARD APPLIES OF TECHNOLOGY SO WE THINK THAT COULD ACTUALY BE A PRETTY WIDE EXEMPTION FROM WHAT WE THINK THE WHAT ARE INNER SENS WHAT THE AUTHOR INTENDS. TO FOR THAT TO APPLY WITHOUT EXEMPTION SIMPLY BECAUSE EIGHTEEN T. ALREADY HAS A REQUIREMENT FOR COPPER LAND LINE -- WE'RE NOT COMFORT CONFIDENT ON THAT BEING -- THAT RESTORATION REQUIRED ACTUALLY BEING APPLICABLES EIGHTEEN T.. I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A DRAFTING ARE THAT WE'RE HAPPY -- TO CONFIRM THAT THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION SEVEN IT'S NOT AND IT WAS INTENDED NOT TO DUPLICATE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO. THAT'S EASILY ADDRESS MAYBE THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS BUT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW -- FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO COME TO AGREEMENT WITH THEM IN THESE THESE. AMENDMENTS WE THINK COVER. ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS UNLESS. YOU DISAGREE DID ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY COMMENTS -- CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO WANT TO THANK ON AUTHOR AND ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE I FIND MYSELF IN A VERY UNIQUE POSITION BECAUSE I ALONG WITH -- CENTER PADILLA AUTHORED THIS MEASURE TWELVE YEARS I MEAN I SEVEN YEARS AGO THE BRING US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY -- REVIEWING THIS AND I CHOSE TO CARRY THIS. LEGISLATION. WHEN I WAS IN ASSEMBLY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS A NEW TECHNOLOGY AND WE WANTED THIS TECHNOLOGY TO OF ALL? IN TAKE HOLD ANY PASS. BUT 'M ALSO CONCERNED AS I HEARD FROM CW A ABOUT. INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAINTAINING INFRASTRUCTURE IN A LOT OF TIMES WE ARE. ARE MISLED AT AS TO BELIEVE THAT FIBER JUST BECAUSE WE PUT FIBER WE CAN ABANDON THE COPPER AND THEY HAVE CLEARLY ABANDONED COPPER I STILL HAVE A LAND LINE IN MY HOME TODAY. I WILL AWAYS HAVE A LAND LINE BUT EVERY TIME I GO OFF LOOK I HAVE NOTHING BUT STATIC. ON MY LINE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS COPPER STEEL THE BACKBONE FOR VOICE IN ORDER TO WORK. STILL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT ONLY MAINTAINED BUT IT RESPONDED QUICKLY -- YOU KNOW TO SERVICE OUTAGES WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WITH THE BAT RAINS. IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE SAW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT -- WITHOUT SERVICE FOR DAYS IN OUT AND YOU WITHOUT SERVICE FOR SOME AS MUCH AS A WEEK. MY CONCERN IS THAT IF IT'S NOT TO PAY YOU SEE AND THAT FOR OVERSIGHT WHAT AGENCY SHOULD THAT BE I DON'T NECESSARY BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE AS YOU SAY THE AVERAGE CONSUMER DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL THE P. YOU SEE. THERE SURELY NOT CALLING THEIR LEGISLATOR WHEN THEY SAY MY PHONE SERVICE IS NOT WORKING SO. WHO SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE CUSTOMER IF IN FACT THERE IS AN OUTAGE AND I I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT SERVICE RELIABILITY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT? AND AGAIN IT'S I KNOW A LOT OF OUR RESIDENTS WILL NEVER OUT OF WHITE BUT I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS. HAVE WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE MY GRADING BECAUSE OF GANT WERE NOT MAINTAINING THE COPPER. WIRE SO IT'S ALMOST A FORCED MIGRATION TO AVOID. SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND. WELL THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THIS SO THEY WILL BE. I I KNOW THAT THE ADDING A LOT OF WE WOULD IF THEY WOULD HAVE THEY COULD STILL REPORTED TO THE UC AND UC WILL REPORTED TO THE AG YOU IS IMPORTANT MECHANISM. AND I I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS AS THE CHAIRMAN STATED YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BROUGHT. ME A LITTLE CLOSER TO BEING SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AGAIN MY CONCERN IS THE INTERSTATE CALLS AS IT RELATES TO OUR OUR FOLKS SURE INMATES HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT ADDRESS AND I WAS ONE OF MY CONCERNS AND I THINK IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RATES WERE. TALKING ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHY SHOULD WE PROTECT PRE PROTECT THOSE FOLKS I'M THAT IS AN ISSUE AS WELL AND WE WERE LOOKING TO BE HONEST -- AT A BILL THAT WILL BE AN ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS BY MISS MITCHELL -- AND WHEN IT HAVE WANTED TO REACH OUT TO HER BECAUSE IT HAS TO DO WITH THOSE CALLS IN PARTICULAR AND SEEN -- MAYBE IN THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS WHERE THAT. WHERE THAT BELONGS IN THIS BILL OR THAT BILL BUT ABSOLUTELY IT'S ON OUR RADAR AND ONE THAT WE KNOW NEEDS TO BE SO IS THERE A COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS THAT EITHER THROUGH THIS? BILL ARE TO MISS MITCHELL'S BILL BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY AND WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION OF DRESSING THAT AND BACK TO RELIABILITY. CALL -- CARRIER LAST RESORT. WHERE DOES THAT FALL? UNDER THIS MEASURE. THAT STILL EXISTS. I MEAN BUT I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW. WHERE THE OVERSIGHT AND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR IT I MEAN -- IT'S STILL YOU SEE A STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT THEY STOP THE THE OVERSIGHT OF THE CARE OF LAST RESORT SO MUCH BECAUSE WHEN COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. WELL THERE'S A COUPLE AGAIN AND JUST SKIMMING NOT HAVING THE AMENDMENTS IN FRONT OF ME I THINK THAT'S A VERY CRITICAL PROVISION THAT LEAVES ALL THOSE RED AREAS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR MAP WITH NOTHING. IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT PROVISION. AND I MISTER HERNANDEZ MENTION SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS QUALIFYING THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN IS ALWAYS HAS AGREED TO A MAN. WE NEEDED TO BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL THAT REGARDLESS OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE THAT CARRIER OF LAST RESORT WE HAVE THE QUALITY SERVICE. NOW. OBVIOUSLY THE MAINTENANCE ISSUE OF THAT OVERSIGHT IS CRITICAL WE WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THAT SORT OF OVERSIGHT. AND OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE'S JURISDICTION HERE I NOT SURE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INTERESTED IN THAT TYPE RURAL AND AND CENTER BRADFORD JUST TO GO OVER THE AMENDMENTS AGAIN. THE ONE THAT CLARIFIES THAT THE CPC HAS THE AUTHORITY ESTABLISHMENT FORCE COLOR AND BASIC SERVICE REQUIREMENTS ON A TECHNOLOGY KNOWN SHOULD CHECK I I JUST THOUGHT THAT I'M SORRY OKAY. ART THANK YOU. A SMALL MEMINTA WHAT I SAW ON THAT WE WANT TO INCLUDE BASIC SERVICE ON THAT. WHEN I THINK YOU AND YOUR ON STAFF FOR WORKING TO INCREDIBLY HARD ON THIS BILL WE -- HAVE BEEN SEEKING AND WELCOME WAYS TO IMPROVE THIS AND ENSURE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED -- WITH -- YOU KNOW A CENTRAL FEATURE OF COURSE IS THAT THE COMPETITION CONTINUES AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY. THE THINGS I'M SO PROUD OF AND I THINK THE THE SENATOR HAVING A SHARE DISTRICT UNDERSTANDS IS -- THE THE QUICK. EXIT OF THE CALLING CARDS AT YOU KNOW. THE ESTABLISHMENTS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THAT USED TO BE SO EXORBITANT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE -- NEAR COMPLETE ACCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO CALL HOME -- TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES WITH. NO COST -- HAS BEEN AMAZINGLY HELPFUL THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF INNOVATIONS WE WANT TO PROTECT AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE WITH BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYONE IN A RURAL AREAS ARE WILD HIGHER AREAS ARE LOW. INCOME AREAS -- HANGING AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE SPELL AND MY COMMITMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IF IF PEOPLE ARE NOT SATISFIED ON THAT LAST VOTE I'M ON THE FLOOR THE SENATE. YOU KNOW. THAT I I UNDERSTAND I MEAN I I I THINK I'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH LOVE YOU LIKE I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A TOUGH BILL. AND SO -- AND YOU KNOW BUT FOR CARRYING IT WOULD WOULD WOULD FEEL THE SAME SO I THINK WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK -- WE JUST AS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY THAN JUST HANDING SOMETHING THE PC WHICH WOULD TAKE IT TEN YEARS TO GET THE KIND OF PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING RIGHT NOW WITH THIS BILL SO WITH THAT I RESPECT LASSEN ABOUT.
