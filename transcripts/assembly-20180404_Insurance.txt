THANK YOU CHAIRED ALLEN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO CHECK THAT THANK THE CHAIR IN HIS STOP FOR THEIR HELP ON THIS BILL AS WELL AS ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN OUR ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO IMPROVE AB TWENTY EIGHT OR TWO IS A MOVES FORWARD. WE ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK DONE ON THE IMPORTANT UNITY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO EXPRESS MY OFFICE IS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE PURSUING THE CORRECT LANGUAGE FOR THAT IMMUNITY BECAUSE. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH TWO WOULD REQUIRE ENSURE TO COOPERATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES TO MATCH INDIVIDUALS WHO OH PAST DUE CHILD SUPPORT WITH THEIR INSURANCE CLAIMS. TO VERIFY THAT INSURANCE PAYMENTS ARE FIRST USED TO PAY PAST DUE CHILD SUPPORT. CHILD SUPPORT IS CRITICAL INCOME FOR ELIGIBLE FAMILIES UNFORTUNATELY MOST FAMILIES ARE NOT RECEIVING THE FULL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE OWED. RECENT ESTIMATES FROM DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES SHOW THEIR APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. OPEN CHILD SUPPORT CASES WITH BALANCES THAT ARE PASSED TO. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OWED AND PAST DUE CHILD SUPPORT WAS SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AT THE IS SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION OWED LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE TO INTERCEPT ONLY NINETEEN MILLION THROUGH VARIOUS CHILD SUPPORT INTERCEPT PROGRAMS. ONLY FOUR MILLION OF THE NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS INTERCEPT IT WAS CAPTURED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIANS INSURANCE INTERCEPT PROGRAM. SEVEN UNDERSTATE OTHER STATES CURRENTLY OPERATES SUCCESSFUL MANDATORY INTERCEPT PROGRAMS WHEN TEXAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED THEIR STATE WHAT INSURANCE INTERCEPTOR AGREEMENT TWO THOUSAND NINE THEY SAW INITIAL A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT INCREASE IN CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS. IN TEXAS IS LAST FISCAL YEAR THE STATE INTERCEPTED AROUND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AB TWENTY ZERO TO IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES AND THE CHILDREN WHO DEPEND ON CHILD SUPPORT AS A SOURCE OF INCOME RECEIVE WHAT THEY DESERVE. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS KELLY HEARTY OF CHILDREN NOW A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEVOTED TO PROVIDING CHILDREN WITH THE VOICE IN POLICY DISCUSSIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. BY THE WAY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'VE RECOMMENDED A SUPPORT POSITION ON THIS. MATCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND. I AM KELLY HARDY SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR WITH CHILDREN NOW. AND I'M THANK YOU CHILD SUPPORT IS CRITICAL INCOME FOR ELIGIBLE FAMILIES. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SOURCE OF INCOME FOR SUPPORTING THE KIDS THAT. I'M ARE IN THOSE FAMILIES THAT RELY ON IT. AND AND. SEVEN OTHER STATES AS AS STATE ED I'M. I HAVE MANDATORY AND SHARP PARTICIPATION PROGRAMS BUT CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM IS STILL VOLUNTARY. AND LESS THAN TWENTY PERCENT OF INSURANCE PARTICIPATE. I'M. IN CASES WHERE NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THEIR SUPPORT INSURANCE INTERCEPTS CAN PROVIDE A CRUCIAL LIFELINE TO THOSE FAMILIES. AND THE KIDS. I IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO MAKE FINANCIAL SUPPORT A REALITY FOR THE CHILDREN IN THE STATE AND I REQUEST YOUR AYE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR. COMMENTS.

AS A SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION WE'RE PURSUING THIS COMMONSENSE CLARIFICATION TO THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I DREW IT DURING THE LAS VEGAS OF LAST LAS VEGAS MASS SHOOTING SEVERAL. OF ORANGE COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFFS WHO ARE OUR MEMBERS. WERE OFF DUTY. THEN HER ROPE WE BROUGHT THEMSELVES AND OTHERS TO SAFETY THEN IN LINE WITH THEIR TRAINING AND THE EXPECTATION OF THE AGENCIES THEY WORK FOR AUTOMATICALLY RETURNED. A TO THE KILLING FIELD TO SAVE MORE LIVES THE SWORN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TRAINING AND INSTINCTS. TO SAVE WILL SAVE LIVES IMMEDIATELY KICKED IN WHEN THE GUNFIRE ERUPTED THESE MEMBERS ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THE SAME THING ARE TRUE HEROES. ONE OF OUR MEMBERS DEPUTY JOE รณ ONE OF YOUR BILL AND THE POLICE SERVICES. WHAT HE DID WAS HE BROUGHT CONCERT GOERS TO SAFETY? CURE THEM AND THEN RETURNED OUT TO THE MELEE TO HELP THE WOUNDED AND WALK WITH DOING THIS HE WAS SHOT IN THE ABDOMEN. AND THE FI. NUMBER ARE DEPUTIES ACTED HEROICALLY EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE SWORN TO DO. HOWEVER WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR THEM TO GET THE CARE IN THE COMPENSATION THEY RIGHTLY DESERVE THE COUNTY OF ORANGE OBJECTED SAYING THE LAW THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW THAT THEY DID NOT PROVIDE A REMEDY. FOR THESE OFFICERS BECAUSE THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE. OUTSIDE. THE STATE LINE. THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE WE'RE SEEKING TO FIX THAT IN STATE OR OUT OF STATE ARE OUR OFFICERS AND DEPUTY SHERIFFS ARE NEVER OFF DUTY. THE PUBLIC. AND THE POLICE CHIEF IN THE SHERIFF'S REASONABLY EXPECT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO TAKE ACTION IN THE SITUATIONS IF WE ARE INJURED OR DISABLED OR DIE AS A RESULT THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY.

COME ON UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JASON SHELTER PARA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. WERE PART OF A COALITION THAT IS OPPOSING LISTA MENDED. WE CERTAINLY DON'T QUESTION THE. INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL UP BY MISTER DALY OF THE REASON THAT IT'S BEING DONE I THINK OUR JOB SOMETIMES IS TO ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS AS CLAIMS BOOKS WE OFTEN HAVE TO OPERATE IN VERY GRAY AREA. UNDERSTANDING THAT A VERY BLACK AND WHITE SITUATION IS BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD WE DO HAVE SOME AREAS THAT WE WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH STAFF. IN THE MEMBER AND SPONSORS AND TALK THROUGH OUR INTENT IN DOING THIS WILL BE TO REACH AGREEMENT WITH MISTER DAILY. AND FOLKS HERE IN THIS BUILDING. AND AND TRY TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. SO THAT BEING SAID A VERY BRIEFLY WE DO HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS THERE IS KIND OF AN OPEN QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. AND SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT. THAT DISCUSSION AND THERE ARE ALSO VARIOUS POLICIES THEY'RE SOMEWHAT CONFLICTING RELATIVE TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT PEACE OFFICERS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE SUPPOSE YOU'VE INVOKED THEIR POLICE POWERS ORANGE COUNTY VERY SPECIFICALLY HAS A POLICY THAT OUTLINES THAT THE POLICE POWERS ARE INSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN SEND YOU A COPY OF THAT. BUT AGAIN THAT'S A DETAIL THAT WE WANT TO WORK THROUGH WITH THE COMMITTEE. AGAIN LIKE WE SAID WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE GRAY AREA THERE VERY BLACK AND WHITE SITUATION SUCH AS THIS. WERE ONE POSITION MAY BE TAKEN BUT I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE TYPES OF CLAIMS THAT WE GET. A WE GET CLAIMS FROM PEACE OFFICERS. THAT GET INJURED AND THINGS LIKE TOUGH MUDDER AND THEN MAKE A CLAIM THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESPONSIBLE FOR STAYING PHYSICALLY FIT. I'M IN THERE FOR THIS TYPE OF INJURY SHOULD BE COVERED SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A LAW CHANGE SUCH AS THIS WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IS KIND OF THAT THE GRAY AREA TYPE OF CLAIM. WHERE? AND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER COULD BE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AND AND CLAIM TO BE ENGAGING IN POLICE POWERS. CONCEIVABLY BUT IN REALITY MUCH LIKE THE TOUGH MUDDER INCIDENT IT WE WOULD BE IN A VERY TOUGH SITUATION AS WE WANT TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE VERY COMPLEX ISSUES AGAIN WITH THE INTENT OF. GETTING TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH MISTER DALY AND SPONSORS ON THE BILL I WITH THAT THANK YOU AND I'M I'M NOT AN URGENT OF ATTACK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VARIOUS STATE PLAYING FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IF AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE CONCERNS THAT WHERE. I'M EXPRESSED AN INNER CITIES AND HONESTLY THANKFULNESS FOR THE HOW I LIKED BUT WE DO WANT TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS AND IN A TIME AND IF VERY APPRECIATE OF THE OPPORTUNITY PADS MEET WITH STAFF AND LOOK FOR THE CONTINUING OF CONVERSATIONS. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. I GOT A QUESTION THREE OPPOSITION MISTER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. IN IN YOUR RESEARCH TRYING TO YOU MADE MENTION ABOUT A MURDER SITUATION WHOM BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LISA MY MY. IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED. SOMETHING WHERE A LIFE IS BEING PLACED IN JEOPARDY BOOM ARM AND. OFF DUTY OFFICERS FROM ANOTHER STATE RESPOND. TO HELP OUT TO SAVE AND PRESERVE LIFE I THINK THAT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION SO AS YOU ARE RESEARCHING THIS. AND TRYING TO COME TO A CONCLUSION. I THINK THE REASON ONE IS AND IT IS WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS PLEASE OFFICERS OUT OF CALIFORNIA RESPONDING. TO A ACTIVELY INVOLVED SHOOTER. SOMETHING TO PRESERVE LIFE. YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP BUT HEAR OF THE. SITUATION WHERE THERE'S AN OFFICER FROM RIVERSIDE WHO WAS PARALYZED. AND HIS WORK WAS COP IS BEING DENIED. THAT TO ME IS UNCONSCIONABLE RIGHT AND SO WE DON'T WANT ANYONE IN UNIFORM TO RESPOND BASED ON. WE ARE POLICE OFFICERS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN DOCTORS OUR DOCTORS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NURSES ARE NURSES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WHERE THEY BEING CALIFORNIA NEW YORK WASHINGTON DC AWARE EVER EVEN IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. LONG AS HE COULD BE SUBSTANTIATED I DON'T SEE WHY THAT. IT'S HARD TO. SUPPORT SUCH A CLAIM AND WAS DALY PLEASE ADD ME AS A COAL AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. AND I WANNA GO OUT CERTAINLY BE WITH YOU LOCK STOCK STOCK AND BARREL TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS BILL GETS THE NECESSARY VOTES IN NEEDS. DOOR TO GET THE GOVERNOR'S DESK IS IMPORTANT THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON AND YOUR OWN AS A CO AUTHOR SOUND I WAS LOOKING FOR QUESTIONS AND MORE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION. ANY MORE QUESTIONS I HEARD. MIGHT SAY NO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO. THIS QUICKLY. TO WIN A VOICE THERE BECAUSE A CALIFORNIA ALSO WITHIN OPPOSE MUST AMENDED POSITION HELPING TO WORK IT OUT WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY MORE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF MISTER COOLEY. LAW. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT. POLICE OFFICIAL IN CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICER. IS SEPARATE THE REQUIREMENT OF. ARTICLE TWENTY SECTION THREE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THAT THEY TAKE THE STANDARD OATH OF OFFICE WHICH WE ALL TAKE. AS LEGISLATORS. SO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO COVER ALL WORKERS PROVIDE A REMEDY. BUT CERTAIN WORKERS ACTUALLY HAVE UNDERTAKEN THIS AND. A FIDELITY TO AN OBLIGATION. A NOT EVERY WORKER HAS TAKEN AN OATH OF FIDELITY TO AN OBLIGATION. POLICE OFFICERS I BELIEVE IN CALIFORNIA DO TAKE THAT OATH. WHICH INCLUDES THAT PROMISE TO. WELL AND FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THE DUTIES UPON WHICH THEY ARE ABOUT TO ENTER. I THINK THIS UNDERTAKING THAT SOMEBODY TAKES AS A PEACE OFFICER. TWO WELL AND FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THEIR DUTIES. IS SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY WE RELY UPON THEM TO ADHERE TO THAT. WITH GREAT FIDELITY. AND. YOU KNOW. THE IDEA. THAT'S A. PURITY GUARD AT THE IN PARKLAND DID NOT RUSH INTO THE FRAY. WHETHER RECESSION WHATEVER THE PURPOSE ACTUALLY BECAME A SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY. I THINK WE ARE DEALING WITH A CLASS OF EMPLOYEES HAVE TAKEN A OBLIGATION FOUNDED IN THE CONSTITUTION. AND TO TAKE A WITH THE UTMOST SERIOUSNESS WHICH IS DISPLAYED IN LAS VEGAS. IS I THINK WHAT THAT OATH REQUIRES. AND IT BECOMES A LIFE YOU KNOW EIGHT. IS A CAREER CHOICE IT IS A HABIT. IT IS COURAGE. AND A WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE LAW SHOULD ENFORCE THAT UNDERTAKING. AS YOU ARE PROPOSING SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER HARPER AND I THOUGHT I SO MISTER GRAYSON TRIED HIS BUTTON WERE YOU UP NEXT TERRACE MISTER HARPER MISTER GRAYSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I I WANTED TO THANK THE SPONSORS FOR A COMING TO ME EARLY ON MAKING THE CASE FOR THIS IN PERSUADING ME TO BE IN FAVOR. AYE AND I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK THE. THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. BOTH OF US WERE NOT JUST THAT RESIDENTS OF ORANGE COUNTY BUT OF THE COUNTY AND SO. I I THINK THIS IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT MEASURE FOR THAT FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY FAMILY AND I'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTING US THROUGH THE PROCESS. MR GRAYSON BECK YOU AYE OF. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS OF THE BILL BUT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE BILL. DOES PRESCRIBE. THAT ONE WHILE THE DUTIES BY WHICH WORKERS COMP WOULD BE COVERED DOES IT OR. ARE THAT IS THERE IS THERE PRESCRIPTIVE LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT WOULD KEEP. THE. EXERCISING AND OTHER THINGS. OUT OF THE. DOES. SO I THOUGHT THAT IN THE TESTIMONY I THOUGHT I HEARD IT. AND IT'S NOT GRAYSON WANTING TO CLARIFY MR GRAYSON LET ME SUGGEST THAT OUR COMMITTEE. STAFF FOR CHIEF A CONSULTANT COMMENT ON THAT POINT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THAT. THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT CLARIFIES. WHAT WE BELIEVE IS CURRENT LAW? THAT'S THAT CLARIFIES. WHETHER WITHIN OR WITHOUT OF THE STATE APPLIES FOR PRESERVATION OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. FOR APPREHENDING OR ATTEMPTING TO APPREHEND. A SUSPECT. PERIOD. NOT OF THEM THAT THEM. I UNDERSTAND THE MATTER. THING. BUT THAT'S NOT IN THE BILL. SO THE THE THE LANGUAGES AND THEIR CORRECT ME ARE A THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND WOOD. ALSO BE HONORED TO. COFFERS WELL. IT'S ANYMORE I QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. STILL A CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON FOR YOUR QUESTION AND FOR CO AUTHORING THE BILL. FROM THE DISCUSSION IS IS A.

AS WAS MENTIONED BY MISTER GIBSON AND OTHERS IT'S A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. BUT DUTY THAT THEY. ARE SWORN TO. SUE. SO THAT'S THE THE RATIONALE FOR THE BILL AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND A. HOPE FOR A POSITIVE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
