01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.379
HERE FOR A REASON AND- THE

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.348
EFFORTS ARE TO TRY TO MAKE IT

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:07.516
BETTER TO WORK BETTER TO

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:09.251
STREAMLINE IT SO THAT IT IS NOT

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:11.787
AT. A CUMBERSOME PROBLEM- IT SO

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:14.022
IT IN TO ME I LOOK AT IF WE

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:15.958

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:18.060
STREAMLINE AND MAKE THE PROCESS

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:20.028
BETTER AND IMPROVE IT. MY

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:21.663
CONCERN IS IN LISTENING TO THE

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:22.931
OPPOSITION READING THE

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:24.933
OPPOSITION LETTERS. AT THE

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.702
OPPOSITION COMING FROM ALL

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:28.771
SIDES I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST.

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:31.340
IT'S ANYONE WHO IS A SEQUEL A-

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:34.643
WHO'D- WITH SECRETIVE WHO.

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:37.212
EMPLOYMENT SHE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; WHO IN I'M&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:37.679
NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.281
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY THEY

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.850
DON'T ACTUALLY WORK SEE WHAT

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.752
THEY DON'T USE IT NEEDED TO AN

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:48.357
HOUR USE IT AND- AND TRY TO

01:13:48.423 --> 01:13:49.858
IMPLEMENTED ON A DAILY BASIS.

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:52.227
NO ONE IN NEWS GROUPS THAT-

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.329
HAVE ANYTHING ARE ARE

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:56.532
SUPPORTING THIS OR ARE FEELING

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:59.401
THAT THE CHANGES THAT ARE.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:02.137
QUITE A FEW. ARE OFFERING A

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.373
SOLUTION TO SEEK WITH THEIR ALL

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:06.175
OPPOSED TO IT AND THAT'S WHERE

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:07.976
THE TROUBLE COMES FOR ME IS IF

01:14:08.043 --> 01:14:09.978

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:12.548
BALL FORWARD IN IMPROVING AND

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:15.083
REFORMING IN ANY LIGHT. THEN

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:16.351
WE'RE JUST CREATING MORE

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.053
OBSTACLES IN OPPOSITION FROM

TODAY I CAN'T VOTE FOR- BECAUSE

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:26.795
OF- OF THAT AND- I DON'T THINK

THAT THERE'S A WAY OR NOR TIME

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:29.798
THAT IT CAN BE IMPROVED IN THE

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:32.568
NEXT- OF NEXT MONTH BASICALLY A

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.503

CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO IN

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:19.101
JANUARY ALL THE OPPOSITION IS

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.702
SUPPOSED TO SEE WHAT I THINK

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:23.071
IT'S- WORKS IN A- VARIETY OF

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:25.007

WORKING OFF OF THE STAKEHOLDER

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:04.046

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:10.185

SO CA BUT GOAL HERE IS HOW DO

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:19.161
WE MAKE IT BETTER THE THIS

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:21.696
STATE. GROUP ARE HAS BEEN A

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:23.298
GROUP THAT I SHOW I DO. A

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:26.168
PRACTICE ON ALSO THAT WANTED TO

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:28.203
IMPROVE THE PROCESS IMPROVE THE

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:31.873
RESULTS ARE AND- CERTAINLY WE

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.241
HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A NUMBER OF

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:34.876
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS- I'M

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.211
HOPING FOR MISSIONAL SUPPORT

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:38.346

HOPING TO TAKE THIS IS BEEN AN

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.717
OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK IT A

01:18:42.784 --> 01:18:44.319
CRITICAL TIME AND CALIFORNIA'S

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.888
FUTURE WHERE WE CAN BRING THE

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:48.557
STAKEHOLDERS TO GET I LOOK

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:50.392
FORWARD TO. I HEARING. SOME

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:52.260
CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS FROM

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:53.862
THE CHAMBER AND THOSE IN

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:58.467
OPPOSITION- TO ADDRESS- THEIR

01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:59.468
CONCERNS ARE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:03.772
SHE QUIT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:05.040
YOU YOU LOOK AT HAT SOME

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:07.342
OBJECTIONS PARK. FACT AND

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:10.545
SOLUTIONS TO ACTUALLY. WE HEAR

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:15.350
THAT FOLLOW. I AM SCHOOL IF

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.152
THAT. IF THE AGENTS ALSO TO

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:19.087
SPEND EIGHT EIGHT. TO OUR THE

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.055
TWELVE LOOP WHICH OF CAN WERE

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:21.523
WORKING ON THAT ARE THE

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.357
DOCUMENT DUMP WE'VE HEARD SOME

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:23.992
SHOULD DOESN'T FAR. AND YET IT

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:25.861
DOES ALLOW FOR PUBLIC. WHICH IS

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:28.130
CRITICAL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.665
DEALING WITH AN ISSUE WHICH HAS

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:33.201
HISTORICALLY. IN ONE OF THE-

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:36.304
MECHANISMS BY WHICH DELAY HAS

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.340
BEEN ARE ENCOURAGED. AND THEN

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:39.508
OF COURSE THERE WAS THE USUAL

01:19:39.574 --> 01:19:40.709
BONDING THERE WAS SOME

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:42.544
OBJECTION THAT THAT. WOULD

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:45.580
INCREASE THE COST WE ARE TAKING

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:48.216
THAT OUT OF THE BILL SO MY HOPE

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.919
IS MY REQUEST IS THAT WE ARE A

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.954
LOT OF THIS BILL TO KEEP MOVING

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:53.788
THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT IS

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:56.258
LONG OVERDUE OR THIS IS A

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.459
DISCUSSION THAT IS A

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.161
CULMINATION OF MANY YEARS OF

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:02.397
DISCUSSION- AND- I'M- I. AM

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:05.500
HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN. COME UP

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:06.902
WITH SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.637
THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:11.239
ARTICULATED OTHER WITH THE SAME

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:13.175
TIME STILL PRESERVE SHE CAUGHT.

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.276
I THINK THAT'S CRITICALLY

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:16.044
IMPORTANT AND TO THE EXTENT

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.379
THAT THOSE GROUPS WHO WERE IN

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:20.148
OPPOSITION. LEGITIMATELY WANT

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:21.249
TO PRESERVE SEQUEL BUT HAVE

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:23.418
SOME. RECOMMENDATIONS AND

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.986
CONCERNS THAT WE CAN

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:27.322
INCORPORATE I AM VERY OPEN TO

02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:23.688
AND WOMEN. WHO ARE. FIVE YEAH

02:14:23.755 --> 02:14:24.289
THE EYES IT IS FAR ARE ENDING

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:26.792
RISK OF DEVELOPING HEALTH

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.627
PROBLEMS- AND WE CERTAINLY SEE

02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:31.763
THAT ELEVATED LEVELS OF P. FIVE

02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:33.265
CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED

02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:35.167
IN THE BODIES OF FIREFIGHTERS

02:14:35.233 --> 02:14:35.967
PUTTING EVEN GREATER RISK OF

02:14:36.034 --> 02:14:41.139
HARM INCLUDE. FIVE THERE'S BEEN-VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT ON IN THIS

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:42.574
AREA HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA

DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A MOVE ON

02:14:48.113 --> 02:14:49.748
THIS UNTIL WE UNTIL OUR FRIENDS

IN THE FIRE FIGHTING COMMUNITY

02:14:51.283 --> 02:14:52.684
FELT COMFORTABLE ULTIMATELY SO

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:54.252
MUCH OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH

02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:56.388
PROTECT THEM BUT OUR FRIENDS

02:14:56.455 --> 02:14:57.355
THE FIREFIGHT THE WORK CONSISTS

02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:59.991
POLICE INITIALLY BRIDGE THAT

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:02.360
FOUR YEARS AGO ABOUT DOING SOME

02:15:02.427 --> 02:15:03.128

02:15:06.498 --> 02:15:07.032
WE WERE TO MOVE FOR ON A BILL

02:15:07.098 --> 02:15:07.566
LIKE THIS THERE WOULD BE

02:15:07.632 --> 02:15:08.567
ALTERNATIVES OUT THERE THAT

02:15:08.633 --> 02:15:10.035
WOULD BE BECAUSE THEY

02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:11.102
ULTIMATELY CARE ABOUT FIGHTING

02:15:11.169 --> 02:15:11.670

HOW GOOD IT. THERE IS A- I CAN

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:26.117
IMAGINE THAT ARE FOR THE FIRE

02:15:26.184 --> 02:15:29.454
pCOMFORTABLE THAT I ANY MOVEMENT

02:15:29.521 --> 02:15:31.389
IN THIS AREA WOULD NOT HINDER

02:15:31.456 --> 02:15:32.257
THEIR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:34.526
FIGHT FIRES THAT PROVIDE AN

02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:36.328
IMMEDIATE RISK TO THEIR LIVES
