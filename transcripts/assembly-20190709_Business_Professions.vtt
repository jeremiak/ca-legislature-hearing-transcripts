THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA BY A

00:19:58.163 --> 00:19:59.765
WIDE MARGIN.

00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:02.234

RECREATIONAL CANNABIS.

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:06.572
LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:08.340
CHALLENGES THE FEDERAL BANKING

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:10.709
SYSTEM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:12.711
CHARACTERIZES CANNABIS A

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:14.780
SCHEDULE ONE DRUG WHICH MEANS

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:16.448
THAT IN THE BANKING SYSTEM.

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.684
YOU CAN'T DEPOSIT THE PROCEEDS

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.385
OF THAT BUSINESS IT'S IT'S

00:20:20.452 --> 00:20:21.787
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:23.522
SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU TRY

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:25.958
TO BALANCE ON THE ONE HAND.

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:29.328
THE PUBLIC POLICY IS INFORMED BY

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.229
THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA ONE ON

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.497
THE OTHER HAND YOU'VE GOT A

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:34.099
COMPLETELY CONTRADICTORY FEDERAL

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.534
POLICY.

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:37.569
HOW DO YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM?

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:38.971
THAT PROBLEM HAS BEEN FURTHER

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:40.839
EXACERBATED BY.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.941
THE FACT THAT IS RESOLVED THE

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:44.710
ENTIRE INDUSTRY IS CASH.

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.478
SENATE MCGUIRE INFORMS ME DON'T

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:47.546
KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE THAT

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.147
THERE'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:50.482
BURIED NORTHERN CALIFORNIAN

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:51.717
BARRELS.

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:53.385
GENTLEMAN CAME TO MY OFFICE AND

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:54.753
SAID HE HAD FORTY MILLION

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.389
DOLLARS AT THE TRACTOR TRAILER

00:20:57.456 --> 00:21:00.025
YOU CAN PARK IN MY GARAGE.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.326
IT'S CREATED AN EXTRAORDINARILY

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:05.130
PUBLIC SAFETY -- PROBLEM IT IS

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.465
THE TREASURER WHO IS ONE OF THE

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:07.699
SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE WE'VE

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.034
BEEN WORKING WITH NOW FOR TWO

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.802
YEARS THEN SHE WAS THE AT THE

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:12.337
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:15.173
TALKS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.341
ACCOUNTING.

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:17.743
AND RECORD KEEPING IN THIS

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.478
INDUSTRY.

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.179
AND ALSO IT HAS A HORRIBLE

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:23.015
IMPLICATION IN TERMS OF COST

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.182
WE'VE SEEN IN OUR BUDGET BUDGET

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:26.018
CHANGE PROPOSALS BECAUSE BECAUSE

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:27.486
GOVERNMENT OFFICES GOT A PUT ON

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:28.920
BULLETPROOF GLASS GOVERNMENT

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:29.488
OFFICES HAVE TO HIRE MORE

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:30.255
EMPLOYEES.

00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:31.957
IT TAKES SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.225
THREE THREE POLICE TODAY A FULL

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.060
DAY TO COUNT FIVE HUNDRED

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.361
THOUSAND DOLLARS YOUR ACCOUNT OF

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:37.596
THREE TIMES RIGHT.

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:39.297
HE GOT C. H. P. ESCORTS TAKEN

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.733
MONEY TO THE BANK TO GET PEOPLE

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.934
BEING ROBBED.

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:43.602
WHAT DO YOU DO HOW DO YOU FIGURE

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:44.503
IT OUT?

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:46.571
INNER THIS MEASURE.

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:48.273
IT IS NOT A PERFECT MEASURE

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.274
ALTHOUGH EVERY OTHER BILL I'VE

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:50.976
EVER TO DEUCE HAS BEEN SO FIRST

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:52.644
EVER OMITTED THAT.

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.414
NOT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT I'M

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.815
THE BILL WHAT IT IS IS TRYING TO

00:21:56.882 --> 00:22:00.519
FIGURE OUT A CREATIVE WAY. TO AT

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:02.320
LEAST.

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:03.955
GO AS FAR AS WE CAN UNDER THESE

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:07.059
VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:08.193
AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.928
INTERIM DEAL UNTIL THE FEDERAL

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:11.229
GOVERNMENT AT SOME TIME BECAUSE

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:12.597
OTHER STATES HAVE LEGALIZED

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:13.699
CANNABIS.

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:15.567
IS GOING TO CHANGE ITS RULES SO

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:16.535
HOW DO WE CREATE AN INTERIM

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.070
BRIDGE THAT WORKS WITHIN THE

00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:20.272
SYSTEM REASONABLY WELL THAT

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:22.674
SOLVES MANY PROBLEMS YOU CAN AND

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.076
TAKES US DOWN THE ROAD IT'S FAR

00:22:24.142 --> 00:22:25.077
AS YOU CAN.

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:25.844
THAT'S AS CONSERVATIVE AS

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:28.447
POSSIBLE AND NOT TOO COMPLEX.

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:30.816
SO INSTEAD OF COMING UP WITH A

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:32.617
COCKAMAMIE PUBLIC BANK IDEA --

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:33.618
WHICH COULD TAKE FORTY YEARS TO

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:35.087
GET IT IMPLEMENTED AND IT NEVER

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:37.322
WORKED THE IDEA WAS TO BOLT ON

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:39.124
TO THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF OF

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.626
BANKS AND SH AND CREDIT UNIONS.

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:43.295
ARE A PROCESS WHEREBY WE CAN

00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:44.930
CREATE A LIMITED CHARTER WHY IS

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.832
THAT IMPORTANT WHY HAVE WE

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:48.366
STRUCTURED THE WAY WE STRUCTURE

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:49.401
WITH THE TREASURE.

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:51.069
RESTRUCTURED AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.170
AN INTERIM PLAY.

00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:53.538
THE IDEA IF IT'S A BANK IT HAS

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:54.940
TO LIVE BY AND LIVE UNDER THE

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:55.841
RULES OF THE BANKING

00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:57.109
COMMISSIONER WHATEVER IT'S

00:22:57.175 --> 00:22:58.543
CALLED TODAY'S FANCY NEW NAMES

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.112
ON MIDDLE GUY RIP I STILL CALM

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:00.679
BANK.

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:01.546
PHONE BANKING COMMISSION WE A

00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:02.814
NEW BANK COMMISSIONER.

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:03.882
SO THAT MEANS THAT THE RULES

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:05.917
INVOLVING FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS

00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:07.719
REPORTING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.221
LOOKS AND FEELS AND SMELLS LIKE

00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:11.590
A BANK ITWILL DO EXCEPT IT HAS

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:13.358
A LIMITED CHARTER TO SERVE FOR

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:14.226
PURPOSES.

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:15.827
AND IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A CLOSED

00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.662
LOOP SYSTEM WHAT CREATES THE

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.264
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:20.832
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S THAT WE

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.301
USE THE FEDERAL WIRE WE USE THE

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:24.402
CLEARING HOUSES IN THE FEDERAL

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:25.070
SYSTEM.

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:25.971
WHICH THEN BRINGS IT TO THEIR

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:27.839
JURISDICTIONS SECONDLY WE USE

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:30.442
FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE A TOUR

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:31.476
FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A POP

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:32.043
THAT BRINGS IT UNDER THEIR

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.978
JURISDICTION.

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.613
SO HOW DOES A STATE ORGANIZED

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:40.886
THAT IN A WAY CREATES A CLOSED

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:41.820
LOOP SYSTEM OUTSIDE THE FEDS.

00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:42.721
IT DOES IT BY ONE USING PRIVATE

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:43.855
INSURANCE COMPANIES I'VE TALKED

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:44.489
TO SAID THAT THEY WOULD INSURE

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:45.791
Là COMPANIES WILLING TO TO

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:47.025
ENSURE THE COST OF INSURANCE

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:48.326
EXPENSIVE IT'S A HECK OF A LOT

00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:50.061
LESS THAN SECURITY GUARDS.

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:50.762
INSURANCE AND ALL THE THE

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:52.197
CHALLENGES THAT ARE INFORMED BY

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:53.665
ANYBODY IN THE BANKING BUSINESS

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.200
I MEAN THE KIND OF HIS BUSINESS.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.868
AND SECONDLY YOU DON'T ALLOW

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:59.504
DEPOSITS TO BE MOVED INTO

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:01.506
FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MEANS

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:04.176
IF I HAVE THE SAY THE EVAN LOW

00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:06.711
CANNABIS CHARTER BANK RIGHT AND

00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:08.346
I GOT AN ACCOUNT AT THE BANK

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:09.881
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS I GIVE

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.050
EVAN LOW BANK MY CASH.

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:13.585

DEPOSIT GIVE ME A RECEIPT THE

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:16.688
BANKS IT'S THERE HE THEN EVAN

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:19.691
LOADS BANK GIVES ME A OUR CHECK

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:20.692
A CHECK BOOK.

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:23.261
THAT CHECKBOOK LOOKS LIKE A

00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:24.062
CHECK LIKE THIS.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.697
IT SAYS BASICALLY THIS CHECK IS

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:27.732

00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:34.573
A RELATIONSHIP WITH.

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.608
NOW IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:38.610
AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE'S

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:40.245
THE GIPSON CANNABIS BANK.

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.113

THEIR NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:00.532
THREE BANKS IN CALIFORNIA

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:01.600

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:02.801
OFTHE CLOSE BECAUSE BANKING

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:03.935
BRANCHES ARE CLOSING.

SO THEY'RE AVAILABLE THIS COULD

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.938
BE AN EASY DEAL HAVE AN URGENCY

PROVISION BECAUSE LAST YEAR I

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:09.307
GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE LAST

IN THIS DEAL.

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:24.623
AND BASICALLY THE BOTTOM LINE OF

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:25.957
FINISH HERE IS THAT WHAT DO YOU

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:27.659
USE THE MONEY FOR IN THIS

LIMITED CHARTER BANKS.

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.799
USE THEM.

PAY THE RENT THE CAN THE PROJECT.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.304
LANDLORD CAN TAKE AND THE AND

CERTIFIED LICENSED FOLKS IT

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:50.015
CAN'T JUST BE ANYBODY PLAN

00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:51.316
AROUND.

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:52.284
AND YOUR VENDORS SO NOW I'M A

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.119
PLUMBER INSTEAD I GETTING TWO

THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MY PERSON

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:56.588
GOES OUT PUTS THE PIPES AND

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:57.355
WATER THE PLANTS THEY GET A

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:58.156
CHECK.

00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.958
IT'S A BETTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:00.792
THIRD.

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:02.827
IT'S TO BE USED TO INVESTMENT IN

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:03.762
THE STATE WITH THE STATE

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:04.729
TREASURER'S OFFICE LOCAL

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.031
INVESTMENTS OF OUR MAKE RETURN

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:07.232
ON MY MONEY.

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:08.566
I DO THAT AND FOURTH WE MOST

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:10.435
IMPORTANCE TO PAY -- GOVERNMENT

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:11.836
FEES SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:13.772
DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE ALL THIS

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:15.307
HEARTACHE IN EXPENSE AND BUDGET

00:26:15.373 --> 00:26:18.009
CHANGE PROPOSALS WITH RESPECT --

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.144
TO COLLECTING MONEY THEY CAN

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.812
ACCEPT THESE CHECKS LOCAL

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:21.413
GOVERNMENTS CAN ACCEPT IT IF

00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:23.048
THEY WANT TO IT'S NOT A PERFECT

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:24.049
APPROACH.

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:24.716
A CERTAIN IS A LOT OF HOLES IN

00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:26.051
IT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WANT TO GO

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:27.585
FARTHER IN THIS AND THAT THE

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:29.321
IDEA IN OUR DISCUSSIONS THE LAST

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:30.588
COUPLE YEARS THE TREASURES

00:26:30.655 --> 00:26:31.856
OFFICER THEN THE BOARD OF

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:33.191
EQUALIZATION IS OFFICE.

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:34.759
WAS HOW CAN WE AT LEAST TAKE A

00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:36.227
STEP THAT WILL PROVIDE SECURITY

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:38.530
ALLOW FOR PEOPLE TO EASILY PAY

00:26:38.596 --> 00:26:40.131
THEIR TAXES OR OTHER FEES.

00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:42.534
AND AND THE UP THE ULTIMATE GATE

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.601
THE DITCH DIGGERS ME TWO MORE

00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:44.269
QUICK POINTS ON RACE POINT

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:45.570
NUMBER ONE IS THE LAST TWO

00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:46.805
POINTS ARE ARE.

00:26:46.871 --> 00:26:48.006
ONE IS THE IDEA THAT THIS WILL

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:49.274
BE EASY TO TRANSFER WHAT'S GOING

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.942
TO HAPPEN IS ONCE THIS BECOMES

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:52.711
LEGAL THE BIG CODES ARE GOING TO

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:53.979
COME IN AND BUY THESE PEOPLE UP.

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:55.046
AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO BUY THEM

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:56.581
UP BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIKE SMELL

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:57.882
LIKE BANKS RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA

00:26:57.949 --> 00:26:58.984
WANT TO BUY THE ACCOUNTS.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.585
SECOND THING IS HOW TO BANKS

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:01.886
MAKE MONEY.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:04.289
THEY TAKE MISTER OBERNOLTE IS A

00:27:04.356 --> 00:27:06.057
SMALL BANK ACCOUNT AND THEY THEY

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:08.593
GET TAKE IS A THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.794
AND THEN THEY LANDED THAT AT ANY

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:11.396
GIVEN 1% INTEREST THEY LET IT

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:12.697
OUT TO SOMEBODY ELSE 48%

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:14.399
INTEREST THEY MAKE THE 7% THEY

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.234
PAY EXPENSES TO MAKE A PROFIT.

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:17.335
THIS WILL BE A LANDING IN THIS

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:19.170
BANK WE CALL THE BANK IT'S

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:20.939
REALLY A FEE FOR SERVICE SO NOW

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:22.674
ALL OF A SUDDEN GIPSON CHARGES

00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:24.609
ME. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:26.177
MONTH TO KEEP AN ACCOUNT IS BANK

00:27:26.244 --> 00:27:27.545
AND EVERY CHECK THAT ARE RIGHT

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:28.246
DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT OF THE

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:33.918
CHECK.

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:34.552
HE CHARGED ME A HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:35.687
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS CHECK WITH

00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:36.321
THAT'S A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE AND

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:36.921
A LOT MORE SAFE AND SECURE.

00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:38.089
THEN WHAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:38.256
IS.

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.824
WE'RE TRYING IN GOVERNMENT TO AT

00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:41.726
LEAST TRY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.694
WE WERE FACED WITH THIS

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:45.530
EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE HOW DO

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:48.900
WE AT LEAST IN GOOD FAITH SHOW

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:50.235
TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THIS

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:52.203
TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN THE

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:53.238
THING.

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:54.539
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE COME

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:55.940
BEFORE US THEIR ACTION FORMING

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:57.142
THESE BANKS TO MAKE COST TEN

00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:59.044
MILLION BUCKS TO FORM ALL OF I

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.811
FIGURE IT OUT.

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:01.946
BUT IT IS A IT IS IN MY JUDGMENT

00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:04.416
A THOUGHTFUL SO INTERIM SOLUTION

00:28:04.482 --> 00:28:05.950
AS WE FACE IS EXTRAORDINARY

00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:07.952
CHALLENGE BETWEEN THE TENSION

WELL.

00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:20.144
THE CANISTERS ARE SOLD WITH THE

IN MANY CASES IT'S VERY

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:58.082
DANGEROUS AS A WITNESS WILL

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:20.271
DON'T KNOW.

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.806

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:24.909

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:27.078
WHEN THEY BEGIN TO USE THE

WE KNOW THAT.

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.400
BUT YOU CAN'T CUT OFF EVERY

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:50.868
SOURCE BUT MUCH THE GOAL OF THE

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:53.237

OXIDE HIGH IS A VERY BRIEF HIGH.

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.195
AND IT REQUIRES CONTINUAL

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:20.698
NURTURING.

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:21.866
THE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS THAT

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:24.402

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:26.137
HAZARDS THEIR HEALTH.

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:30.675

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:55.686
HUFFING OR INHALING NITROUS IS

SOMETHING THAT IS SOLD.

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:41.371

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:41.939
BECAUSE I JUST SAT HERE AND

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:42.940

THEM.

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:58.222
FROM BEING SOLD IN STORES.

00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:00.224
ISN'T ISN'T JUST IN THE EASIER

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.824
THING TO DO FOR PEOPLE TO BE

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:02.459
ABLE TO ORDER THEM ONLINE AND

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:03.927

EASY ACCESS.

00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:06.797
WELL FIRST OF ALL THOSE COULD

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:09.433
NOT THEN GO TO ANYONE WHO WAS IN

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.068
A TREATMENT FACILITY IS A

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:12.836
WITNESS TO TESTIFY.

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:13.637

CAN GET ONLINE THAT CAN BE VERY

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.312
HARMFUL.

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:24.581
MY POINT IN THIS IS SIMPLY TO

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:28.185
MAKE IT LESS AVAILABLE.

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:31.255
AND LESS AVAILABLE MEANS IN

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:32.623
SMOKE SHOPS.

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:34.658
THAT'S A SIMPLE FORMULA TO MAKE

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.059
IT LESS AVAILABLE.

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:37.528
MAKE THE NITROUS OXIDE LESS

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:39.997
AVAILABLE.

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:41.365

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:49.339
THIS BILL.

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:52.176
INCREASE THE AWARENESS.

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:54.811
OF FAMILIES BEEN VEGETABLES.

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:56.580
OF THE DANGERS.

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:59.449
OF NITROUS OXIDE.

00:46:59.516 --> 00:47:01.451
IT'S KIND OF A STEALTH.

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:03.954
AFFLICTION RIGHT NOW AND THE

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.022

WE BELIEVE.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.928
THERE WILL BE LESS OF IT USED.

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:12.996

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:29.046
TIME [inaudible]

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:38.422
CALL ATTENTION -- TO THIS ISSUE --

00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:41.992
I'VE I BELIEVE IT'S ONE OF MANY

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:44.061
INVOLVING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:45.762
THAT ARE OUT THERE AND I THINK --

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:51.201
FRANKLY -- WITH -- OF MOST OF

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:53.537
THE CATEGORIES OF SUBSTANCES

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:55.672
THAT ARE OUT THERE -- THAT ARE

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:56.640
BEING ABUSED.

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:57.741
WE'RE FIGHTING INCREMENTAL

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:58.976
BATTLES.

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:02.546
AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS

00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:05.749
ULTIMATELY IS THE SOLUTION.

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.918
BUT AS YOU POINT OUT I THINK IT

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:10.053
MAKES -- AND WOULD MAKE AN

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.258
INCREMENTAL DIFFERENCE -- THERE

00:48:14.324 --> 00:48:16.159
HAS TO BE SOME WAY OF CALLING

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.894
ATTENTION PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:21.431

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:23.033
OTHERWISE SEEMINGLY.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:23.934
INNOCENT.

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:27.738
PRACTICE AND AND YOU KNOW I

00:48:27.804 --> 00:48:29.773
DON'T THINK HERE BILLS A PANACEA

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.807
I DON'T THINK YOU THINK IT'S

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:35.846
BASS EITHER -- BUT IT ISN'T AN

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:37.014
INCREMENTAL STEP IN A SUPPORT.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.348
IT WAS AN EYE OPENER ASSEMBLYMAN

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.516

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:44.788
ONE HUMAN BEING.

00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:46.523
THAT WAS SUFFICIENT.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.958
TO WHAT MY INTEREST AND PASSION

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:52.863

AND SEEING NONE THEN SEVEN IS A

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:00.904
MAY I ASK YOU A SPECIFICALLY

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.572
WITH REFERENCE TO THE COMMITTEE

SOME OF THESE PURCHASES TO THE

00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:11.581
NON.

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:14.251
LICENSE -- ESTABLISHMENTS YEAH

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:15.886
THIS IS IN TOBACCO SHOPS AND

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:17.554
TOBACCO SHOPS AND ARE REGULATED

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:18.722
MORE HEAVILY IN THE STATE OF

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.391
CALIFORNIA AND SO THE QUESTION

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:22.392
OF THE THOUGHT BEHIND

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.328
INDIVIDUALS THEN GOING ELSEWHERE

00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:26.496
AND LESS REGULATED ENVIRONMENTS --

00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:27.864
COULD THAT BE A CHALLENGE FOR US

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.032
TO REALLY TACKLE THIS ISSUE I

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:30.500
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD ANY

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:31.702
COMMENTS WITH RESPECT THAT.

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:34.604
WELL I THINK I DID COMMON THIS

00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:36.373
GERMAN JUST A BIT AGO.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.641
CERTAIN.

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:41.178
IT'S AS EASY AS THE INTERNET.

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:43.613
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.315
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT.

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:47.484
AND IT'S AN ARGUABLE THAT THIS

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:49.753
LEGISLATION WOULD MAKE IT MORE

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.321
DIFFICULT FOR SUN.

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:53.090
WHAT THEY THEN SEEK OTHER

00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:55.425
SOURCES SURE?

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.361
BUT WE ALSO HAD THE ADDITIONAL

00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.596
VALUE OF GETTING MORE PEOPLE

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:02.332
UNDERSTANDING.

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:05.402
OF THE QUICK THE AVAILABILITY.

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:08.405
IN OUR COMMUNITY EACH OF THIS.

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:10.374
HOPEFULLY THEN TO DISCOURAGE

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.577
THEM FROM GOING TO INTERNET AND

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:15.479
OR BLACK MARKET SOURCES.

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.481
YOU BET YOU NEVER STOP THE BLACK

00:50:17.547 --> 00:50:19.015
MARKET SOURCES FOR WHATEVER.

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:21.618
IT WILL BE THERE.

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.720
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE AND

00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:25.522
INCREASE [inaudible]

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:27.357
PUBLIC AWARENESS.

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:28.825
OF SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:33.663
DANGEROUS. TO OUR SOCIETY.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.464

UNNECESSARY PROVISION.

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:36.049
VIOLATING THE TRUST OF A PATIENT

IN THIS WAY IS PERHAPS THE MOST

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:40.320

HOW LUCKY HER BOYFRIEND WAS.

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:06.547
THE PSYCHOLOGIST TOLD THE CLIENT

01:43:06.613 --> 01:43:08.015

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:28.608
EXPLOITED BY THESE THERAPISTS.

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:29.943
SO.

01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:31.678
OUR ABILITY TO TAKE THAT EXTRA

01:47:31.745 --> 01:47:33.747
MEASURE USED TWENTY NINE SIXTY

01:47:33.814 --> 01:47:35.148
POINT ONE AND ARE PRESS THAT ARE

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:36.850
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:37.951
PRACTICE ACT.

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:40.287
THAT'S THE REVOCATION MECHANISM

01:47:40.353 --> 01:47:41.788
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:43.557
USE FOR THIS -- NOT

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:45.225
UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT WHICH SO

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:47.360
FAR DOES NOT RESULT IN

01:47:47.427 --> 01:47:48.595
REVOCATION EVEN IN THE MOST

01:47:48.662 --> 01:47:50.697
EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES LIKE THE ONE

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:52.833
DR PHILIP TO AND SEVEN TWENTY

NINE YOU SAY DOES NOT A WOULD

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.569
NOT BE SUFFICIENT AS WELL SEVEN

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:56.403
TWENTY NINE IS IT SUFFICIENT

01:47:56.469 --> 01:47:58.104
BECAUSE IT USES SEXUAL CONTACT.

01:47:58.171 --> 01:48:00.307
AND THAT CONTACT UP AND INTO

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:01.308
MEANT.

01:48:01.374 --> 01:48:02.542
IT'S SEXUAL INTERCOURSE OR

01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:04.444
CONTACT SODOMY ORAL COPULATION

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:05.979
SEXUAL CONTACT WITH THE PATIENT

01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:07.047
OR CLIENT.

01:48:07.113 --> 01:48:08.114
THAT IS YOU UP WITH TOUCHING OF

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:09.015
AN INTIMATE PART IN THE PENAL

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:11.218
CODE AND OF COURSE THAT DOES NOT

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:12.819
INCLUDE THE BREAST OF A MAN OR

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:13.887
TOUCHING OF ANY OTHER PARTS

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:15.522
OTHER THAN THE **** GROWING AND

01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:16.389
THE BOX.

01:48:16.456 --> 01:48:18.825
SO THEY'RE VERY NARROW FOR THAT

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:19.926
PURPOSES.

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:21.127

01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:30.203
IF I COULD RESPOND JUST BRIEFLY --

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:32.038
WE HAVE SITUATIONS NOW WHERE

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:34.307
PEOPLE ARE USING THINGS LIKE

01:48:34.374 --> 01:48:35.709

PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH A CONTACT.

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:37.777
WITH THEIR COMPLETELY

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.246

SEXUAL ISING.

01:48:41.047 --> 01:48:43.250
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CLIENT --

01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:44.885
THEY COULD ENGAGE IN PHONE SEX

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:47.387
WITH THE CLIENT AND STILL NOT BE

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.422
SUBJECT TO REVOCATION WITHOUT

BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE.

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:54.394
AND CURRENTLY KISSING IS NOT

01:48:54.461 --> 01:48:55.095
INCLUDED IN TOUCHING OF AN

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:56.563
INTIMATE PART SO THEY CAN

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:57.964
CONTINUE.

01:48:58.031 --> 01:49:01.635
TO KISS AND MAKE OUT ESSENTIALLY --

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:04.004
AND THAT DOES NOT COUNT AS WELL.

01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:05.605
SO THEN I GUESS MY THEN I GUESS

01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:06.706
THEY QUIT IF IF THIS IS A

01:49:06.773 --> 01:49:09.009
WIDESPREAD.

01:49:09.075 --> 01:49:09.209
ISSUE.

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:11.578
WHICH I I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:13.280
BUT IF IT IF IT IS A WIDESPREAD

01:49:13.346 --> 01:49:14.047
ISSUE THEN WHY IS IT JUST

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:15.849
PSYCHOLOGISM WHY ARE WE DOING

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:17.050
AND ALL THE HELPING PROFESSIONS

01:49:17.117 --> 01:49:18.184
ALSO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD.

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:19.786
YEAH RESPOND TO THAT IS FIRST OF

01:49:19.853 --> 01:49:21.288
ALL -- THE BOARD'S PSYCHOLOGY

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:24.324
CAME TO ME WITH THIS -- I THINK

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.026
THAT IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:27.661
THE COMMITTEE DESIRE TO AND FELT

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:29.095
THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR

01:49:29.162 --> 01:49:30.697
OTHER BOARD STYLE BE CERTAINLY

01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:32.232
THAN HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:34.367
PROPOSAL FOR AMENDMENTS. TO

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:36.269
ADDRESS THAT -- YEAH BUT I SO I

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:37.904
I THINK THE BOARDS ECOLOGY CAME

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:40.173
TO ME WITH THIS PROPOSAL BUT IF

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.741
THE REASON IF YOU'RE IF THINK

01:49:41.808 --> 01:49:43.076
ISSUE IS IT'S TOO NARROW.

01:49:43.143 --> 01:49:45.011
I CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE THE

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:47.280
ASSISTANCE OF THE THE COMMITTEE

01:49:47.347 --> 01:49:48.415
TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:49.916
FAMILIAR WITH THE OTHER BOARDS

01:49:49.983 --> 01:49:50.583
OUT I'VE BEEN AND I DON'T REALLY

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.652
HAVE THE STAFF TO GO AND ASK

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:54.654
EACH BOARD DO YOU NEED THIS --

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:56.957
SO YOU KNOW WE WERE NOT PROPOSED

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:59.326
ANY AMENDMENTS -- TO TO TO TRY

01:49:59.392 --> 01:50:00.360
TO DRESS THOSE CONCERNS OF THAT

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:01.695
WAS A SIGNET THAT'S THE MAIN

01:50:01.761 --> 01:50:03.129
CONCERN OF THE COMMITTEE --

01:50:03.196 --> 01:50:05.198
WE'VE BEEN HAPPY TO TO TO

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:05.932
ENTERTAIN AND AND AND EXAMINE

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:07.801
THAT -- BUT THAT'S NOT GIVEN THE

01:50:07.867 --> 01:50:10.170
OPPORTUNITY TO SELL SO -- IT IT

01:50:10.236 --> 01:50:11.638
IS A POOR TO PSYCHOLOGY BILL AND

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:13.540
THAT'S SO WHY IT IS THE WAY IT

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:15.008
IS RIGHT NOW BUT CERTAINLY WOULD

01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:17.344
BEEN OPEN -- TO SEE IF PROPOSALS

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:18.778

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.047
WRITE THIS OTHER THERAPISTS AND

01:50:21.114 --> 01:50:21.581
EIGHT OF THE CODE DOESN'T

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:22.749
ADDRESS THOSE AS WELL AND HAVE

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.417
SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:50:24.484 --> 01:50:26.152
THE OTHER BOARDS.

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:27.153
RACE BECAUSE HE NOW SAYS

ALREADY COVERED UNDER THE CODE

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:33.626
RIGHT SO THAT'S MEAN.

01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:35.228
SO I GUESS THAT'S MY ISSUE IF IF

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:36.830
YOU KNOW OFFICES ALL CLEARLY

01:50:36.896 --> 01:50:38.064
COVERED UNDER THE CODE.

01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:39.933
THEN WHY WOULD WE JUST DO ONE

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.901
SMALL JUST THAT THOSE ARE MY

01:50:41.968 --> 01:50:42.535

01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:57.650
NOTE THAT AGAIN -- THE BEHAVIORS

01:50:57.717 --> 01:50:58.385
ARE.

01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:00.320
COVER BUT THE PENALTY -- IS

01:51:00.387 --> 01:51:01.588
UNFORTUNATELY -- YOU'RE NOT ABLE

01:51:01.654 --> 01:51:02.756
TO REMOVE THE LICENSE AND SO DO

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:03.790
YOU THINK ABOUT A THERAPIST WHO

01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:04.858
ENGAGES IN THIS KIND BEHAVIOR WE

01:51:04.924 --> 01:51:05.592
CAN PUT THEM ON PROBATION.

01:51:05.658 --> 01:51:07.227
BUT THE BOARD AND WHO IS HERE

01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:07.994
WHO IS TRIED.

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:11.498
AS AS BEEN UNABLE TO BE ABLE --

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:13.099
TO ACTUAL REVOKE THE LICENSES OF

01:51:13.166 --> 01:51:14.968
PEOPLE THIS BEHAVIOR NOW HERE IN

01:51:15.035 --> 01:51:16.069
THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:17.704
UNFORTUNATELY I'VE HAD TO DEAL

01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:19.372
WITH THESE ISSUES -- AMONGST

01:51:19.439 --> 01:51:20.407
WHETHER IT'S OUR COLLEAGUES IN

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:21.975
THE LEGISLATURE STAFF OTHER

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:23.476
PEOPLE WE SAID THIS IS

01:51:23.543 --> 01:51:26.279
UNACCEPTABLE AND THERE SHOULD BE

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:28.448
CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT.

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:30.016
THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY SAYS.

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.451
HIS JOB IT IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:33.586
SAYS THERE SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT

01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:34.020
CONSERVE AND THERE'S

01:51:34.087 --> 01:51:35.922
CONSEQUENCES IF IT.

01:51:35.989 --> 01:51:38.992
BASICALLY IS AN ABUSE OF THAT.

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:42.128
THE PATIENT CLIENT RELATIONSHIP --

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:43.696
THE THE THERAPIST CLIENT

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:46.299
RELATIONSHIP. TO THE AGREE

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:48.034
DISAGREE THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:49.135
WE SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF

01:51:49.202 --> 01:51:50.670
REVOKING THE LICENSE BECAUSE

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:52.405
OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT.

01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:53.740
THEY WILL STILL BE ABLE TO

01:51:53.807 --> 01:51:55.975
CONTINUE CONTACT FUTURE PATIENTS

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:57.143
ARE I'M GOING PATIENTS WHEN

01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.411
THEY'RE ON PROBATION AT THAT THE

01:51:58.478 --> 01:51:59.846
MEDIA TAKING CLASSES ANY UNDER

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:01.514
SUPERVISION BUT AN INVENTION

01:52:01.581 --> 01:52:03.750
PROVISIONAL AND AND SO IT'S THE

01:52:03.817 --> 01:52:05.685
BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY WHO'S HERE

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:07.587

RIGHT IT'S NOT DOCTOR PAN GOING --

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:10.356
I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE

01:52:10.423 --> 01:52:11.524
IS THE BOARD'S PSYCHOLOGY SAYS

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:15.395

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:23.403
ENVIRONMENT HERE.

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:24.704
WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE

01:52:24.771 --> 01:52:26.172
EVEN MORE VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.807
