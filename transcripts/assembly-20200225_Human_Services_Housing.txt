THIS JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITH MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU WHOSE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. HAVING OUR COMMITTEES HOLD THIS DISCUSSION TOGETHER IS A TESTAMENT TO THE WIDESPREAD REACH AND THE IMPACTS OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG YOUTH. AND EQUALLY WIDESPREAD RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE TO SIX SOLUTIONS TO THIS CRISIS. AND IT IS A CRISIS. YOU WILL HEAR THAT FROM MANY OF OUR SPEAKERS TODAY. LAST MONTH GOVERNOR NEW SOME SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CREATE A NEW FUND AIMED AT COMBATING HOMELESSNESS BY FOCUSING ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SERVICES IN CREATING NEW TEMPORARY HOUSING. IT'S VITAL THAT WE INCLUDE YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. THESE EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED A REQUIREMENT THAT CERTAIN PERCENTAGES OF RECENTLY ALLOCATED FUNDS WE SET ASIDE TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. BUT DESPITE THESE RECENT EFFORTS WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS STILL MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THIS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION RECEIVES ADEQUATE SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT ARE TAILORED TO THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. FOR TODAY'S HEARING WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM PROVIDERS DECISION MAKERS FROM THE YOUTH WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS FIRSTHAND TO SET THE FOUNDATION OF DEFINING AND IDENTIFYING HOMELESS YOUTH. WE WILL LEARN ABOUT THE WORK BEING DONE TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HOW RECENT INVESTMENTS TRANSLATE INTO ADEQUATE OR PERHAPS INADEQUATE SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR THIS POPULATION. AND REVIEW PROGRAMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO OUR YOUTH TO ASSESS THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT GAPS EXIST IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE HIGH RATES OF YOUTH LIVING ON THE STREETS. ADD TO A DOUBLE THE NEXT STEPS FOR CALIFORNIA TO FURTHER SUPPORT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. FINALLY WE WILL LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND DISCUSS IDEAS NEEDS AND PROGRAMS. WE'LL LOOK AT PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO BETTER SERVE OUR HOMELESS ON HOUSE AND COUCH SURFING YOUTH. I DO WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING TODAY- WE HAVE SOME WONDERFUL PANELISTS THAT ARE GOING TO- PROVIDE THEIR INSIGHT IN ALL THE AREAS THAT WE'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT AND I WANT TO THANK THEM. AS THEY SAY IN SPANISH THEN THE MONO BEFOREHAND FOR COMING TO SPEND SOME TIME HERE WITH US ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK THE CHAIR OF. THE OTHER PART OF THIS JOINT- EVER- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST- EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF- THIS IS- COMMITTEE HEARING THAT HAS BEEN LONG IN COMING- I THINK BOTH FROM ISRAEL'S MYSELF AND MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES WE UNDERSTAND- THE INTERSECTION ALLEY OF SO MANY POLICY. AS YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT SAYS. THE LACK OF HOUSING. AND YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR A SOCIAL SAFETY NET. AND THE APPROPRIATE HUMAN SERVICES TO ADDRESS IT. WOULD CERTAINLY- IS THE CHAIR IT LAID OUT A NUMBER OF THINGS I WAS GOING TO SAY SO. I'M NOT GONNA REPEAT IT EXCEPT FOR THE ONE POINT THAT. THE HOMELESSNESS IS THE MORAL DILEMMA OF OUR DAY I AND- IS NOT ONLY THE TOP PRIORITY FOR MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IT IS A TOP. ISSUE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS I AND- WE'VE ALL BEEN HORRIFIED AT THE EPIDEMIC OF HOMELESSNESS SAY WE ARE TEAM ON OUR STREETS. AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND NOT JUST. IN GENERAL BUT IN PARTICULAR THE MOST TRAGIC FACE OF HOMELESSNESS WITCHES OUR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE- WE KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS. FOR YOUNG PERCENT CREATES LONG TERM TRAUMA THAT THAT IN THE BILL WILL CARE. FOR THE REST. ARE WE WITH THAT IS YOU HOMELESS. PERSON THAT SICK. AND YOUR LIFE OF THE HOMELESS AS AN ADULT. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY- HOMELESS YOUTH BECOME HOMELESS- WHETHER THEY ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM- WE HAVE TOO MANY LGBTQ YOUTH. WHO ARE LEAVING- DIFFICULT- FAMILY SITUATIONS- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY HOMELESS YOUTH WHO ARE FLEEING ABUSE VIOLENCE IN THEIR HOMES. AND WE KNOW. THATHOMELESS YOUTH. LIVING WITH ALMOST FAMILIES ARE OFTEN TIMES- THE VICTIM OF POVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY THESE ARE ALL OF A VARIETY OF IN A SPECTRUM OF REASONS WHY. YOUNG PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS- AND THAT IS REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING TO FIGURE OUT- HOW IS IT THAT WE ADDRESS THE- AREAS NEEDS. OF FOR POPULATION WITH PREVENTION WITH EARLY INTERVENTION. FORTY PANEL AND REST ASSURE A COLLEAGUES ONLY FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF SERVICE. WILL BE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER THIS YEAR BEYOND INITIAL YES BUT THAT TURNED BACK BETTER. MISTER CHAIR. AND YOU ARE CON CALL LIKE TO PROVIDE YES STONE THANK YOU TOO BYE OF OUR CHURCH THIS IS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT IN AS THE LEGISLATURE OF THE PAST YEARS. AS WELL ACTUALLY ASSEMBLY GOES BACK EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT BECAUSE THE SOMEBODY'S MADE HOUSING A PRIORITY. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVEN'T SEPARATED IS THAT ISSUE AROUND HOMELESS YOU AND- TRYING TO FIND DEAL WITH HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST. A MATTER OF PUTTING A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY LOOKING AT THE ROOT CAUSES A LOT OF WHICH GOES BACK TO TRAUMA. AND VERY DIFFICULT FAMILY SITUATIONS SO THAT YOUTH AND UPBEAT ON THE TILE WELFARE SYSTEM IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEY END UP HOMELESS. FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND- IF WE ARE GOING TO BREAK THOSE CYCLES WE HAVE TO HELP THE FAMILIES WE HAVE TO HELP THE CHILDREN. AND THEN THAT. REDUCES THE AMOUNT WHO WILL. TEND TO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS. FUTURE SO FOR THIS POPULATION. PROPER LEVEL SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE IS COMMON. THERE IN REAL. TO IT. IN WHAT'S YOUTH AND SPECIAL. TO FOR YOU WHICH WHICH WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN AND EVEN FROM THE LATEST PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. AS WE VAST TO PUT A TO ADDRESS HOMELESS YOUTH IN THE BUDGET THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HASN'T HAPPENED. SO UNLESS WE'RE WILLING TO RAISE THE QUESTIONS AS WE ARE HERE WHICH I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. AND LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO OUR HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATIONS THAT I'M AFRAID THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE OVERLOOKED. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THIS LET'S KEEP OUR YOUTH. FOREMOST AS WE THINK LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS. THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A COLLECTION WE CAN. THIS IS A POPULATION WE CAN HELP BUT WE HAVE TO BE DEDICATED TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMITTEE HEARING IS ABOUT AND I'M- VERY HAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ALSO FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THE CONTENT CARE- LEGISLATION OVER THE YEARS.

COMMITTEE MY CUT MY YEAH CHIEF CONSULTANT DOCTOR DEBORAH COOPER AND ALSO- CONSULTANT FOR HUMAN SERVICES OF SO MANY YEARS KELSEY CASTIEL AND WITHOUT I'D LIKE TO INVITES THE FIRST PANELISTS. SHERA HYATT. ELLIE SUDDEN AND SUPERVISOR HILDA SO LEASE TO COME UP. SURE A HIGH IT IS THE PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA HOMELESS YOUTH PROJECT WELCOME- ELLIE SUDDEN DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR HOMELESSNESS BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY AND OF COURSE OUR VERY OWN. OF FORMER SECRETARY OF LABOR UNDER DENTAL BHAMA- FORMER SENATOR- FORMER ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN- BUT MOST. MOST IMPORTANTLY SHE'S HOURS SHE'S FROM CALIFORNIA OUR SUPERVISOR HILDA SO LEASE SO- IF WE IF YOU'D LIKE WE CAN BEGIN WITH HER HIGH IT IN THE ORDER LISTED. GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TO HEAR HIGH AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOMELESS YOUTH PROJECT- AND I MANY BE GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF KIND OF BACKGROUND WHAT'S HAPPENING YOUTH HOMELESSNESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE KNOW THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION. EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT 12% OF THE NATION'S POPULATION SO WE'RE REALLY OVER REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE X. THING HOMELESS. IN CAP YEAH UNDER STANDARD. A HOMELESSNESS ARE YOU ALMOST. WE TEND TO USE THINK OF IS ANYBODY WHO'S LACK A FOR REGULAR AND NIGHT TIME BY BACK IN AND COUCH SURFING LIVING DOUBLED OR TRIPLED UP OUT OF ECONOMIC NECESSITY STAYING IN HOTELS OR MOTELS- EMERGENCY SHELTER TRANSITIONAL HOUSING STAYING AND CARS ARE ABANDONED BUILDINGS- ALL OF THOSE BECAUSE WE TEND TO THINK OF AS MOST INCLUSIVE EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS THAT'S MOST RAPPERS OF WHAT WE SEE. I'M IT NEARLY ALL THOUSAND ON A COME. MY AND TRANSITION AGE YOUTH AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR WERE COUNTED LIVING OUTSIDE ON A SINGLE NIGHT IN JANUARY IN TWENTY NINETEEN- IN ADDITION TO THAT TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY. PARENTING YOUTH AND THEIR CHILDREN WERE ALSO COUNTED LIVING OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA- HAS OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE UNTIL THIRD THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. I'M LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DATA. A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS OUR IDENTIFIED IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS- AS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AT SOME POINT IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SCHOOL YAR. AND WE KNOW BOTH HUD'S POINT IN TIME COUNT NUMBERS AND THE DEPARTMENT THE CASE NUMBER IS TO BE AN UNDERCOUNT. WE LOOK AT OUR HIGH PATIENT THE STUMP I HEARING CAL. ONE IN TWENTY YOU SEE STUDENTS ONE IN TEN CSU STUDENTS AND ONE IN FIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCES HOMELESS AT SOME POINT DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. SO WHAT'S UNIQUE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS RIGHT DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED FOR THIS POPULATION. I'M THEY MAY OR MAY NOT USE ADULTS SERVICES- OR IF THEY DO THEY MIGHT NOT BE CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS THE APPROPRIATE WAYS FORWARD WHERE THEY'RE AT IN LIFE. THEY'RE OFTEN LACKING RENTAL AND EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT LIFE SKILLS AND UNABLE TO AFFORD MARKET RATE RENTS. I OFTEN ATTACHED TO FAMILIES ALSO. HOMELESSNESS OR IN MANY CASES ARE UNACCOMPANIED MEANING THAT THEY'RE NOT IN THE CARE OF A PARENT OR GUARDIAN. SO WHO EXPERIENCES HOMELESSNESS WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS- SO LGBTQ YOUTH AND YOUTH OF COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH ARE OVER REPRESENTED- IN LARGE PART DUE TO SYSTEM DISCRIMINATION. PREGNANT AND PARENTING YOUTH ARE ALSO REALLY OVER REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMUNITY AND ARE UNDER SERVED IN COMMONLY OVERLOOKED BY A LOT OF OUR HOMELESSNESS SYSTEMS. A YOUTH EXIT BUT WELFARE AND JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS OFTEN EXIT INTO HOMELESSNESS OR HAVE EXPERIENCES OF HOMELESSNESS. SO HOW DO THESE YOUNG FOLKS SURVIVE ON THE STREETS. WELL SOME MAY NEED TO TURN TO SURVIVAL SEX FOR A PLACE TO STAY OR IN EXCHANGE FOR OTHER BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD MONEY OR CLOTHING. LACKING A PERMIT ADDED MAY BE EXCLUDED. FROM TRADITIONAL FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND THAT'S THE CASE WE NEED TO TURN THE LENS BACK ON OURSELVES AND ASK WHAT THE LATTER'S OPPORTUNITY ARE THAT ARE AVAILABLE. YOUNG PEOPLE RATHER THAN VILIFY OR CRIMINALIZE THEM FOR PARTICIPATING IN ACTS OF SURVIVAL. ONE THING WE KNOW IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT 50% OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ADULTS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR SO IS REALLY KEY TO MENTION THIS GAME I THINK OF PREVENTION. NO THE HOMELESS DOES DURING ADOLESCENCE DISRUPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS AND CREATES LIFELONG REPERCUSSIONS NOT ONLY EMPLOYABILITY AN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT BUT ALSO THE GREAT HEALTH AND WELLNESS- WHICH INCREASES RISKS OF SUICIDE AND SUBSTANCE OVERDOSE WHICH WE KNOW TO BE KIND OF THE TWO HIGHEST BECAUSE THE MORTALITY FOR THIS COMMUNITY. SO IT WORKS FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND I WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS A BIT IN HE FUTURE PANELS BUT LONG TERM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING- RAPID RE HOUSING. OTHER TYPES OF NON TIME LIMIT OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE GREATER NEEDS DEDICATED STATE FUNDING AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THROUGH HE'D BEEN HAP- WE'VE HEARD TO THERE'S MORE NEED TO CONSULT WITH PROVIDERS ARE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THIS COMMUNITY. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE FUNDING FRAMES. OF YOUTH CARVE OUTS HAVE BEEN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL WITH SOME COMMUTING TO OPT INTO. OR THAN THE MEN AND APES ON YOUTH SNUS IN WRECKED. STORE KIND OF LACK OF FUNDING TO ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IN PARTICULAR. WE'VE ALSO SEEN TINY HOMES AND HOST HOMES IT'S KIND OF INNOVATIVE TRAGEDIES HAPPENING A DIFFERENT COMMITTEES ACROSS THE STATE. SOME OF THE BARRIERS ARE WHAT'S MISSING OF WHAT WE HEAR A LOT THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING ARTS AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS. THERE'S A NEED FOR MORE SHELTER AND TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR MINORS IN PARTICULAR- THERE'S VERY VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN SERVICES FOR MINORS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. A THINGS LIKE THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IN THE CRIMINALIZATION OF HOMELESSNESS LARGELY UNDERMINE OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO ACCESSING EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION AND HOUSING. THERE IS A NEED FOR HARM REDUCTION EFFORTS MOVING SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OTHER LONG TERM STRATEGIES TO GET PEOPLE HOUSE. OF THE CURRENT CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS IS MANY DECADES IN THE MAKING AND WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO UNDO WHAT IS WHAT IS NEED TO CONSIDER HARM REDUCTION FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY LIVING AND SHELTERED. WE NEED STRONGER PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS ASWELL. A LOCAL PROGRAMMATIC DATA SHOWS THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY BUT IT'S UNDER RESOURCE. AND LASTLY WE NEED TO LISTEN TO YOUNG PEOPLE OF LIVED EXPERIENCE THE HOMELESSNESS IN ALL OF OUR SYSTEMIC EFFORTS AND DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS. THE ONLY WAY WE KNOW. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS HELPFUL IS IF WE WORK WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST CLOSELY IMPACTED BY THIS ISSUE. OTHER WILL HELP US LOOK AT POLICIES OF THE LENS OF THESE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS AND CREATE MORE INTEREST SEXUALITY ACROSS MOVEMENTS FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE CHILD WELFARE. UNDOCUMENTED DISABLED AND OTHER MARGINALIZED YOUTH POPULATIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. THANKS SO MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE- ME THESE QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER EACH PANEL. I'M SUCH A HERA AND THE BACK ON PAPER DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF SORT OF LAYING OUT SOME OF THE TRENDS WE FENCING- SO GOOD AS TO THAT THE FOLKS UP WITH THAT TOGETHER- I DO JUST WANT TO WANT TO SAY TO THE POINT OF THE KNOW WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT POINT IN TIME COUNTS AND EFFECTIVENESS AND NOT EFFECTIVENESS. REGARDLESS OF SORT OF MINOR CHANGES AND TRAJECTORIES I THINK WE CAN ALL SORT OF AGREE THAT HAVING AT ANY GIVEN POINT ALMOST THOUSAND YOUTH AND STATE- EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IS WAY TOO MUCH SO OUT WE AT THE STATE KNOW THAT WE CLEARLY NEEDS MORE HEAD YOU BETTER- SO IN THAT CONTEXT I'D WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE HOPING IT AT THE STATE LEVEL. I'M SUCH A GIN THAT HE PROGRAM WITH REGENCY AID PROGRAM THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T LOVE ACRONYMS- IT WAS IT WAS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM ALLOCATED LAST YEAR TO FIFTY FOUR JURISDICTIONS SO ARE FORTY THREE ZERO SEASON AND ELEVEN CITIES 5% OF THAT AT MINIMUM PER JURISDICTION WITH THAT WAS TO BE SPENT NEW THERMOSTAT COMING. THE JOB REPORT IS MENTIONED IN. BIRDS NOTE THAT WERE SEEN. I GREATER IN. THE THAT 5% THEY SORT OF QUOTED A- TEMP. 3% COMMITMENT BELIEVE HE'S PROGRAMMING I WOULD JUST SORT OF NOTE THAT THAT COMMUNITIES ARE CONTINUING TO COME BACK TO US WITH REQUESTS FOR ALTERATIONS AND HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THESE FINDINGS. IF THEY'RE SEEING SORT OF A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THAT FELL THROUGH WHERE THEY WANT TO TWEAK SOMETHING THAT'S WORKING BETTER. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM TO SEE HOW THAT HOW THAT PLAYS OUT AND SO. WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HOW MUCH OF THAT FUNDING IS ACTUALLY BEEN PUT TOWARDS HOME USE HOMELESS. RENTAL UNTIL THE END OF THAT. OF THE FUNDING I PERIOD NEXT JUNE. BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE SEEN SOME REALLY. ENCOURAGING SIGNAL FROM MY FULL OF CAN YOU. IS I JUST A LOT OF. IN NUMBER HAS DOUBLED THERE WAS. ASIDE WITH ORIGINALLY REQUESTED. YAGO FAR. MONTEREY A HANDFUL OF THE UC'S HAVE ALREADY SORT OF INCREASE FROM WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY PROJECTED THEY WOULD SPEND. I AND YOU THOMAS AND PROGRAM WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD SIGNAL THAT THEY'RE SEEING SOME THINGS THAT. WORKING OR ARE THAT A GREATER NEED THAN THEY EXPECTED AS THEY STARTED TO START. THE YOUNG AND SO PERHAPS THE ASSET FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW AT PART OF THE HEAT STATURE. WERE IS THAT THEY SUBMIT OVERLY. TO OUR BUT WE RECEIVE THOSE AS OF JANUARY FIRST AND HAVE BEEN DOING SOME EARLY ANALYSIS OF WHAT. IS IN THOSE REPORTS AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- THUS FAR WE'VE SEEN A MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING- BEING TARGETED ON YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AROUND EMERGENCY SHELTER NAVIGATION CENTERS ARE DAY CENTERS I THINK THAT'S NOT A- SURPRISE GIVEN HOW THE FUNDING WASN'T WAS SORT OF INTENDED AND FRAMED- WE'VE ALSO. HEARD CONSISTENTLY THAT THERE AREN'T SAFE PLACES FOR USED TO GO THAT ARE IN CRISIS AND SO. A STRONG INVESTMENT IN. OUR PRIMARY INVESTMENT THAT ISN'T IN IT ISN'T AS HUGE SURPRISE AND IT'S SOMETHING WE WERE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF- BUT CLOSELY BEHIND THAT WE'VE SEEN SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RAPID RE HOUSING. OUTREACH STRATEGIES PREVENTION AND DIVERSION. AND A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THAT TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE MINIMAL PROGRAMMING. AROUND HOST HOMES- WENT TO HER MENTION A LITTLE BIT SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT REUNIFICATION ACTIVITIES. SO THAT SORT OF AN INITIAL SENSE OF WHERE WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THE FUNDING FROM KEEP GOING. BUT I THINK OVERALL ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN MOST. ISN'T ONLY I WOULD THINK RISE BY WHICH IS PLEASED TO SEE IN THOSE ANNUAL REPORTS. IF YOU THAT ARE RE THINKING CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW TO DRESS THAT CRISIS WITH. IS JENNIFER IT'S OFTEN FIRST TIME MANY. COMMITTEE HAVE HAD FIVE. TARGETING YOUTH AND- THINGS SOME STRONG AND- IS IN THE EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS. FOR COME. AT THIS. HAVE FOLK I PLACES FOR YOU TO GO THAT OUR PRICES. FOCUSING ON HOW THE BROADER HOMELESS A SYSTEM CAN BETTER ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF USES AROUND COURTED ENTRY SYSTEMS- SOME OF WHERE THE TRADITIONAL. AND. A LITTLE BIT MORE. WE PROVIDING CONSISTENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WE START TO SEE SOME OF THE ANNUAL REPORTS WERE FOLKS ABOUT HAVING CHALLENGES OR THINGS LIKE THAT. TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES ON ON ON HIGHLIGHTING THINGS THAT ARE WORKING WELL AND WORKING THROUGH THINGS THAT ARE. A BIT CHALLENGING IN THAT IN THAT SAID IF HE FUNDING. BUT WE ALSO HAVE- EVER IN THE MIDST OF A AB REVIEWING APPLICATIONS THAT WERE JUST DUE FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH FOR THAT. HAPPENED PROGRAM- THE HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT WAS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN JURISDICTION SO WE'RE- DOING OUR VERY BEST AND ARE IN THE THROES OF REVIEWING A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN APPLICATIONS. THE STATE TUNED- BUT THE FUNDING FOR THAT I'M HAD AN INCREASE- FOR THAT THE MINIMUM AMOUNT TO BE SPENT ON YOUTH FOR HALF FUNDING IS EIGHT PERCENT. SO EAGER TO SEE- YOU KNOW WHAT COMMUNITIES LEARN FROM FROM THE HEAT FUNDING AND SORT OF WHERE THEY'RE CHOOSING TO TARGET THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT. ARE OUT. WELL WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF REVIEWING APPLICATIONS TO SEE WHAT WHAT IS IN THERE AND GETTING THAT THAT FUNDING OUT- I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE- YOU KNOW THINKING THROUGH SOME OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE PARTS WE CAN BE PROVIDING FOR BOTH GROUPS. FUNDING WERE MET STEP OF PLANNED OUT SORT OF A SUMMER FALL USE WEB IN OUR SERIES THAT WOULD BRING IN COMMUNITIES IT OF IT. REALLY GOOD WITH THE FUNDING. BUT ALSO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE BEEN IN GREAT BURKE A FEDERAL PARTNERS THAT HAVE BEEN. GOOD WORK REALLY TRYING TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR PETER SHARING FOR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT. THIS IS SORT OF THE- TIME MANY OF THEM HAVE HAD. INDIRECTLY TARGET FOR YOU. OVER EAT. SOME AND TECHNIQUE. SINCE OURS. THAT'S THIS ROUTE PROVIDING TA. COUPLES ARE SPECIFIC AREAS THAT RIPPING THROUGH ONE OR BILL AT HOME WITH THE THAT WORKS FOR PARTICULARLY AROUND I CAN'T RECALL I THINK FEW OF YOU MENTIONED THE REAL NEED FOR HEARING FROM YOU FIFTH LIVED EXPERIENCE WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE. AND SO REALLY HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE WORK THE COMMUNITIES OF AN USE IT OR ARE YOUTH ACTION I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT THOSE I WOULD SAY BOTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT I THINK WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN THAT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL I'M THINKING ABOUT HOW CORD THREE FOR. CAN BE BACK. DID ALSO THINKING ABOUT SUCCESSES THOSE IN RIGHT SO WHAT WHAT IS WERE AROUND OF HOUSE WHAT IS WORKING AROUND ST OUT OF REACH WHAT IS WORKING AROUND RAPIDLY HOUSING SORT OF GOING THROUGH EACH OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS AND TRY HIGHLIGHTS SOME THE BEST PRACTICES A COMMUNITY AND TAKE AWAY SOME THAT SORT OF STAY TUNED THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED IN THE ISLAND YEAR I FIT. IN STRINGS WE ALSO THE IS CREATING FINANCE CZARIST OR THE POLICIES ACTIVE IN CONCERT A HAND OF THINGS THERE THAT I JUST WANNA SORT OF- NOTE THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF WORKING ON AND I THINK WE'LL SEE SOME GOOD PARTS SONGS I COUNT. HERE MANY. A MATE. EIGHT WIDE WHERE HOW WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE A STATEWIDE DATA BUT THAT WOULD GET A LOT OF THE PIECES THAT ARE IN THE HOMELESS YOUTH ACT- SO REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND GATHER THE DATA WE NEED TO WE KNOW THAT AGE MY **** IS NOT A HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IS NOT EVERYTHING BUT IT WOULD AS A LEVEL OF THAT WE HAVE YOU HAVE NEVER HAD AT THE STATE WELL I'M REALLY BE THE UNDERSTAND AND UNDERSTAND. WHERE WORST AND SO WE'RE. TAKING THAT. BACK WHERE HOW. CAN GET. I COLOR YOU KNOW. IDEALLY THIS CALENDAR YEAR IN THE MIDST WORKING UPPER PROCESS IS THE STATE AND BUT THAT REALLY ALLOW US TO GET SOME OF THE DAY THAT IS FROM THAT FROM THE ACT AND START TO UNDER KIND OF MEASURABLE OUTCOMES ANGLES WE'D BE PUTTING IN PLACE AROUND YOUTH HOMELESSNESS- WE ARE ARE ARE IN THE MIDST OF IN AND THINKING THE REST OF. AN OKAY AT THIS STAGE IT IS AN SORT OF UP. SOME OF. HOW DO WE ARE HOMELESSNESS HAD WE ADDRESS SOME OF BROAD BUT USE THAT THEY SORT OF GOALS WITH AN ACT I THINK WOULD BE DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THAT STRATEGIC PLAN- AND THEN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IT IS ACTUALLY CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY IN THE- AND WE'RE- EAGER AND- WILLING TO. OTHER WEIGHT WRITING OP A PURE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND THEN BRINGING IN EXPERTS THAT THAT HAVE. HAVE NOTHING THAT COMMITTEES COLORED SOFT UP THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HONORABLE CHAIR WOMAN CARE PERSON- CHIU IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AND OBVIOUSLY ELOISE REYES IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU WHEN ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE READ THE GROUND REPORT THAT THE COMMITTEE TOGETHER I THINK IT'S GREAT INCLUDES. AT I'M GLAD SIT TO- OUR GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES IN OUR STAKEHOLDERS HERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT- WHERE WE'RE GOING ON THIS ISSUE REALLY NICKEL AND HOMELESSNESS. THE TOP OF MY HEAD EVEN THE TO TELL YOU AND UNABLE SAN WE HAVE MILLION PEOPLE. DON GIVEN AS YOU HAVE HEARD NINTH OR MORE PEOPLE REMAIN HOMELESS AND A GOOD PORTION OF THAT OBVIOUSLY ARE ARE YOU. OF THE LARGEST NOT. IN THE LIST. NOT PROUD TO. BUT NONE THE THIS IS BEEN PROBLEM. ONGOING FOR NO OF YEAR AND I IT'S I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONE BULLET TO ADDRESS. REGARDING HOMELESSNESS AND WHEN YOU DEAL WITH YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE AND YOUNG ADULTS I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE CHALLENGING FOR US BECAUSE MISS UNDER MISUNDERSTAND OUR MISTAKE THAT ALL ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND HERE WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE I DID SOME. BALL HAVE RATE. COMING FROM A FAMILY BEEN TOWARD ART. ASSIST THE CHILD IS BEEN IN FOSTER CARE OR BEEN IN A PROBATION CAP OR A CHILD THAT HAS LIVED IN A- IN A FAMILY THAT HAS. OF UNDERGONE TRAUMA. THOSE ARE SCARS. ARE YOUNG CHILDREN AND- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- IN LA COUNTY ALONE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND. A YOUNG RESERVE. WE KNOW. OF WORK IS HOME THIS. MORNING TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN. YOUTH HOMELESS COUNT AND THAT'S A LOT SIGNIFICANT NUMBER WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. UP TO CAL YEAH. SO TWENTY TWO PER. IN TIME TO THE TEAM AND THAT NUMBER AND THEN THIS LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF OUR YOUTH HOMELESS COUNT WE ALSO SAW. CREE PROPER OVER IN IN HOME AND THAT THAT IS. BECAUSE FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE PUT IN I BELIEVE- YOU ALMOST NEED TO HAVE. MAYBE TWO OR THREE MORE DOLLARS AND NOT JUST THE STATE BUT ALSO FROM I SAY THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF OUR OUR ACCOUNTING I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY INNOVATIVE WE PASSED A MEASURE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO A YOU WILL BE HEARD ABOUT IT MEASURE H. WHERE WE ACTUALLY TAXED OURSELVES AND WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO STAND UP AND IN TEN YEARS AT LEAST PROVIDE A STREAM OF FUNDING. AND WHILE IT ISN'T A CURE ALL FOR EVERYTHING I THINK IT'S LET US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO BE ABLE TO. TO THE AS THEY SAY PEEL THE ONION BACK AND START TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE GOT HERE BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE FIND PEOPLE YOU EVEN YOUNG PEOPLE OTHER THAN OUT STREET FOR MANY YEARS. IN. BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS CAN NO LONGER AFFORD THE RENT FOR WE HAVE MOTHERS SINGLE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD MOTHERS COMING IN AND TESTIFYING. TO OUR COMMITTEES AT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO TELL US THAT. OF RENTS WENT UP. MAYBE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR. A MOTHER THAT'S WORKING MINIMUM WAGE JOBS AND HAS FOUR CHILDREN. CAN HARDLY BEAR THE BRUNT AND SO WE'RE FACED ALSO WITH COMING UP WITH OTHER TOOLS TO TRY TO. ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS BUT I KNOW TODAY'S SUBJECT MATTER IS ABOUT THE U. AND FOR ME. HEARTBREAKING IS TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE JUST THIS LAST JANUARY WE OPENED UP. TWENTY FOUR HOUR WINTER SHELTER. AND WITH THAT WE DECIDED WE WOULD. HOUSE UP ABOUT A HUNDRED. HUNDRED WILL JUST OF FOR. FOUR MONTH PERIOD AND- FILTERS ARE. BUT I WOULD YOU IT WILL BE ADDITION MONEY TO ADDRESS SOME TEMPORARY SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE NOW THAT WILL HELP US THEN IDENTIFY. MORE CHRONICALLY OF YOUNGSTERS THAT REALLY NEED TO RECEIVE HELP AND I'M TALKING ABOUT AGE GROUP IT'S AROUND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY FOUR. THOSE YOUNGSTERS HAVE FAILED IN SCHOOL MANY EMIGRATE AUSTER JOBS HAVE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND. THE WHOLE SLEW OF SERVICES SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING FOR ADULTS OW HELPING THEM IS. A SCOUT RESIDENTS. GETTING THERE. GETTING THEM BACK IN SCHOOL AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A SYSTEM OF CARE AVAILABLE CASE MANAGEMENT IS. ONE OF THE COSTLIEST TO HIDE AND I SAY MY OPINION THAT'S WITH REALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO FACTUALLY- AND DO IT THROUGH A SYSTEM OF CARE WHERE YOU CAN INTEGRATE. THIS ONE'S RECORD YOU CAN INTEGRATE THEIR HEALTHCARE THE CLIENTS. INVOLVEMENT THEY'VE HAD WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO YOU A FULL BODY EVIDENCE OF WHAT THAT YOUNG CHILD A PERSON IS GONE THROUGH. AND BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW MORE IMPORTANTLY WITH THE ARE AND BE ABLE TO. WHAT THAT THE THAT YOUNGSTERS FACING AND HOW WE CAN HELP TRY TO RECTIFY THAT AT THAT POINT IN SOME WAYS IT'S A LITTLE LATE BUT I WOULD SAY WE HAVEN'T DONE IT I DON'T KNOW ANY SYSTEM THAT HAS REALLY BEEN ABLE TO. TO TACKLE ALL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT NOW IN OUR PROBATION DEPARTMENT BUT THAT'S JUST ONE DEPARTMENT WHAT ABOUT OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM INTEGRATING THEM BEING ABLE TO TALK TO. OUR JUSTICES ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED DEPARTMENTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU TO TRY TO CREATE A- NEW ONE OF INFORMATION THAT'S RELATIVE AND THAT CAN BE UPDATED EASILY AND ACCESSIBLE GIVEN GIVEN CONFIDENTIALITY. BUT NONE THE LESS IT HAS TO HAPPEN AND THAT COSTS MONEY THE COUNTY LOS ANGELES- I WILL TELL YOU DOUBT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT ALL THAT DATA. ANY A COP. A MANNER. IN SOMETHING STAY. TO OF. AND BE PUT ON THE TO THAT BECAUSE WE TALK SETTING SYSTEM OF CARE. EVERYWHERE BUT IF YOU HAVE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND WHEN WE STOP THE REPEAT REPEAT THE GOAL. MAY CONTINUE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY AND THAT'S WHAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE JUST LEARNED IN THE LAST. REALLY FIVE YEARS OF ON THE SUPERB. TO SEE. ATTAR TOOLS FOR SOME REASON IS NOT WORKING FOR THEM AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIX. I THINK THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH UP SHELTERS PROVIDED- OFFER YOU STIRS. I. THE LADY IN EAST LOS ANGELES AND INCORPORATED AREA THAT ACTUALLY HAD TRANSITIONAL AGE. OF ASSISTED LIVING FOR YOUNGSTERS AT IT WAS COSTLY. BUT IT WAS IT WAS VERY TIMELY. AND IT WAS VERY NECESSARY SINCE THAT TIME I CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU TAT ANY OF THE- NEW FACILITY HAS BEEN BUILT. BECAUSE IT COSTS MONEY CAPITAL BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE SYSTEMS OF CARE THE CASE MANAGEMENT THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND THEN MAKING SURE. THAT THAT THOSE CHILDREN ARE OUT YOUNGSTERS ARE ABLE THEN TO GO TO SCHOOL. NUMBER ONE BUT ALSO OBTAIN SOME JOB TRAINING AND COUNSELING SKILLS. JOB TRAINING I THINK IS REALLY ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IT OUTLINED IN YOUR REPORT. YOU MENTIONED. HOW MANY OF THESE YOUNGSTERS- DON'T DON'T HAVE A HOW CAN I SAY. CONFIDENCE OF THE ABILITY TO EVEN. EVEN A MAINTAIN THEIR OWN HOUSEHOLD LET ALONE. BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OT THAT ACCOUNT. OF WHO HAD AND NAVIGATE SYSTEM. THAT THE PARENTS WERE NOT EVEN ABLE TO THEM. REAL HELLO YOUR SETTING UP THESE YOU. FOR FAILURE UNLESS YOU PER THEM WITH THE ATTIC ADEQUATE A TREATMENT AND CARE THAT THEY NEED AND IT'S GOING TO COST AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOU THAT THOSE ARE. REALLY I THINK A SIMPLE A SIMPLE THING WE NEED TO PROVIDE MY STAFF WROTE VERY LET THE ARM. PROPOSAL HERE. NOT PROPOSAL BUT OUTLINED IN I WILL SHARE IT WITH YOU WITH YOU BUT I'M REALLY JUST SPEAKING OFF THE CUFF BECAUSE I THINK IT'S MORE. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET A CANDID VIEW OF WHAT- ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT REPRESENTS AND I ONLY REPRESENT TWO MILLION PEOPLE BUT I REPRESENT ONE OF THE POOREST. AND TO THE CHILDREN ARE CLASSIFIED AS- UNDER UNDER THE DEFINITION OF HOMELESS HAPPEN TO BE BLACK BROWN CHILDREN. AND THOSE OF THE CHILDREN THAT WERE FAILING RIGHT NOW AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE WE HAVE TO INSIST. THAT OUR SCHOOLS RECEIVE AT A- COUNCIL AND SERVICE MENTAL HEALTH. AND SPUR IT IT IT CAN'T HAVE OR TWO. HEALTH INDIVIDUALS HELP IDENTIFY BUT MORE. HELP THEM NOW. SPECIALLY FOR DOC I DID. A LOT. TO PROVIDE ABOUT. BUT THAT INCREASE INCREASE POPULATION THAT ALSO SEEN. AN AND GIVEN THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT A JUST FROM COMMUTER. UNDOCUMENTED REPRESENT ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THEY- ARE TIMID. THEY ARE ALL POLL FEEL FEET FEAR FOR HARASSMENT- BUT IN ASKING ANY KIND OF THIS SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I VERY. FOR OUR SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THESE YOU. WHO THEY ARE- BUT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM AND THAT GOES FOR ALSO COMMUNITY STUDENTS. I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO. FORCING FORCING. THE MAYBE I'LL IN THEM TO MUCH COLLEGE CAN. BECAUSE THEIR SUCCESS AND BY IS REALLY GOOD TO DEPEND ON ON- WHAT OUR OUTLOOK IN IN MOVING AHEAD BEING ABLE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON EDUCATING AND KEEP YOUNGSTERS IN THE AGE OF GIVING THEM OFF IT IS TO ATTEND COLLEGE BUT ALSO NOT HAVE TO FOR AND AN MOVE ON. INST ON UP. THERE IT'S LIKE ON THAT CAMP WE OUGHT TO BE PER MORE SYSTEM WE OUGHT TO BE ALLOWING FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING TO BE MADE AVAILABLE. TO OUR JOINING CAMPUSES WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN EAST LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW NEXT TO CAL STATE LA. AND EAST COLLEGE SO WE AS A COUNTY OR- DO THIS LOOK AT PROPERTIES THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN ASSETS AND TO BUILD ON THAT AND IN FACT I WANT TO JUST MENTION ONE THING TO YOU I DON'T KNOW IF SOME OF YOU. HEARD BACK WAS THE- SAND. AND HALL. OF AT THE TIME IN CARE. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO CARE FOR FOSTER CHILDREN THAT WERE A TRAUMATIZED OR PHYSICALLY ABUSED- INCIDENTS HAPPEN THERE THEY CLOSED DOWN THE- LADY. SO MANY IS IN MY DISTRICT. IT STILL REMAINS HALF OPEN I WANT TO REPURPOSE IT SO THAT WE CAN CREATE HOUSING FOR TRANSIT WELL AGE YOU. ALSO PUT IT HOUSING FOR ADULTS AND ALSO FOR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS ALONG WITH THAT AT. LEAST AND TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL THAT STILL REQUIRE THAT AND A LOT FOR AB. ON PROPERTY ALL OF THOSE THINGS I. IN IN MY OPINION. A WELLNESS COMMUNITY COMMUNITY THAT CAN HEAL AND IF WE START TO LOOK AT KEEPING OUR COULD OUR YOUNGSTERS IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY GROW UP. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF RIGHT NOW ALL IF A CHILD IN MY DISTRICT AND SAY EL MONTE THE CITY OF THE MONEY HAS TO TRAVEL TO GET LGBT Q. A USER. BECAUSE THEY'RE HOMELESS THEY WILL PROBABLY I'M IN A PLACE MILEY WITH WHICH IS ABOUT. SEVEN THIRTY MILES AWAY HOT THAT CHILD HOW DOES A PERSON GET THERE. HOW DOES THAT PERSON HAVE A GATE THAT SYSTEM AND WHO'S GOING TO BE AT THE OTHER END OF THAT OF THAT. APPROACH I'M THERE TO HELP THEM TO SHOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO THE RIGHT TREATMENT AND CARE. SO IS IT. PROVIDING FOR OUR YOUNG AN OPPORTUNITY AT THE TABLE IS WELL AS THE SAN AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTY IS DOING AND I LOVE IT THE GOVERNOR HAS CHALLENGED US TO DO MORE IN THIS AREA AND WE AT THE COUNTY ARE PREPARED TO DO THAT I THINK WE'VE CEDED THE PERCENTAGE AP. NO WE HAVE THE WORD WE WANT PARTNER WITH YOU WE WANT TO WORK ALONGSIDE WITH YOU AND SEE HOW WE CAN GET THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE I THINK THAT OTHERS A LOT OF MISSED. WITH RESPECT TO HOMELESSNESS AND SPECIAL THE YOUNG PEOPLE SO YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH SUPERVISORS POLICE. I'D LIKE TO- SEE IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL. YES MATHIS. ON ONE SIDE OF SUPERVISORS LEASE I THINK YOU'VE TOUCHED ON A LOT OF REALLY SOLID POINTS- THEY DIDN'T PAUL I DO POLICY PAUSE EVERY YEAR AND A LOT OF WHAT YOU MENTION OF WHAT YOU. WAS THE SAME THING THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING AND ONE OF THE MOST RURAL AREAS- I REPRESENT TULARE COUNTY. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA HOMELESS IN THE STATE- YOU DON'T. PUT YOU TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS. YOU KNOW THE JOB TRAINING THE EDUCATION BECOME KEY IN THE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES AND I FEEL LIKE ESPECIALLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE CAN I GET- INTO THIS HOUSING FOR MENTALITY AND WE FORGET IT ABOUT THE TREATMENT AND THE TRANSITION ASPECTS. AND YOU KNOW THE FACT IS THAT. WHEN ESPECIALLY WITH OUR YOUTH A LOT OF TIMES THEY GO UNNOTICED SADLY AND TELL THE GET ARRESTED OR THEY END UP IN ANY ARE WHICH IS WHERE THE TREATMENT AT THIS HOW BEEN IN TO RAISE YOUR SPOT ON THE CITY THE CASE MANAGEMENT ASPECT IS THE CONVERSATION WE HAD WITH OUR HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTOR INTO LARRY COUNTY WITH OUR SHARE WITH OUR D. A. WITH PROBATION WITH THEIR SUPER EVERYBODY WAS SAYING. THIS IS ANNE ALONG FOR AN ISSUE. THIS IS A HUMAN SERVICES CRISIS AND WE NEED MORE CASE MANAGERS THERE BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEWHERE FOR THEM% TO COME IN. AND KIND OF DO THAT TREE OPTION IN. LIKE YOU SAID THE FOR PICTURES. WHAT IS THEIR EDUCATION WHAT IS IT DOTHEY HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD TO THE WHAT HEALTH CONCERNS MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS IN BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT HOLISTICALLY. TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS PERSON AND WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT DO THEY NEED TO GET SO WE CAN GET THEM CLEANED UP GET THEM TRANSITIONED. IN THEN GET THEM BACK TO IN A VITAL PART OF SOCIETY. AND I THINK UNTIL WE FIGURE THAT ASPECT OUT. ST OUR SCHOOL COUNSELORS HAVE. REQUIREMENTS EVERY EVERYBODY ALONG THE WAY HAS THESE DIFFERENT HAVE A REQUIREMENTS. THE WITHOUT THE MILLION OVER TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. TO REALLY GET THAT FULL WRAPAROUND SERVICES AROUND SOMEBODY. EVERYBODY'S WORKING IN A DIFFERENT SILO. AND WE HAVE TO BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS TO ENSURE THAT WHOLE LISTICLE PERSON CARE THAT WE WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR DECADES. BUT THE SILOS ARE STILL THERE. AND I THINK THAT'S IN ON THE COMMITTEE SIDE- MANAGER WE NEED TO LOOK. FORD IS HOW DO WE MAKE THE SILOS DOWN TO A WOUND THAT OPEN FLOW COMMUNICATION. BECAUSE ONCE WE GET THESE INDIVIDUALS IN. A AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE IN THE BACK OF A COP CAR IN NEEDS TO BE THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. THE ON SET OF TAKING INVOKING THEM DOWNTOWN. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. IN TALK TO THE HUMAN SERVICES CASE MANAGER. AND GO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON. WHERE YOU AT IN THE END WITH THE FOLLOW UP WAS CASE MANAGERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP IN AND HOW THE POWER IN THE ABILITY. SMALL CASE WOODS TO FOLLOW DID YOU GO TO YOUR DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT DO YOU GO TO YOUR BACK APPOINT. HOW COME OUT. FROM YOUR ACCOUNTS THAT YOU'RE DISHING. WITHOUT THAT FOLLOW OF ASPECT. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OR PROBATION BECAUSE THESE WE DONATED CRIMINALIZING THESE KIDS FOR SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS WE NEED TO STEP UP OUR GAME. AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE ON. THE SIDE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE ON THE BACK OF PROBATION. WE NEED TO BE PART HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT. AND MAKE SURE THAT THESE CASE MANAGERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE MORE WHILE. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO IT. WE JUST NEED TO STOP TALKING ABOUT IT AND- GET THE SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN GO OUT AND ACTUALLY DO IT. WITH THAT HUMAN SERVICE CASE MANAGER CAN SHOW WHILE. CAN FOLLOW UP AND TALK TO THEIR BOSS OF YOU KNOW WHAT SIR TRANSITION AND THEY'RE WORKING IN MAKE SURE. YOU DON'T COUCH SURFING I'M I'M A VETERAN I KNOW ALL ABOUT COUCHSURFING BEEN THERE DONE THAT I'VE GOT BODIES IN. IT OUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU FORGET ABOUT BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG KEYS. THAT I SEE ACROSS THE BOARD REGARDLESS OF RURAL OR URBAN. THE THERE ISN'T A DIVIDE ON THIS IT'S THE SIMPLE FACT IS. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. ON THE POLICY SIDE TO ALLOW THAT OPEN FLOW OF COMMUNICATION AND WE NEED TO PUT IT IN OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR TWO SURE THAT THAT FIGHT IS GOING TO INCREASE CASE MANAGEMENT ENSURE THOSE WORKLOADS ARE SMALL. A I'M VERY PROUD OF HOW YOU HAD THAT- QUESTION FOR MY SENIOR ISSUE HERE. SO I'M ON THE EDGE CARE A SUPERBOWL HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. YOU TALKING FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE- IN MY POLICY PARTY KIND OF CALLED IT THE TRIAGE TREATMENT TRANSITION THE THREE TV'S. BUT FROM THE YOUTH PERSPECTIVE. WHERE DO YOU SEE THE S. POINT OF BRINGING IN THAT CASE MANAGER AND HOW SOON I MEAN IS IT WHEN THEY GET ARRESTED AND INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM AND BOOKING THEM TAKING THEM SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HEAR FROM FROM THE PROFESSIONALS IN AND BACK HOME. BUT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS DOES THAT MAKE SENSE WELL I THINK LIKE YOU SAID YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO BE THE FIRST POINT OF INTERVENTION AND I THINK INHERENTLY WHEN THAT HAPPENS THEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE SORT OF THIS LIKE. A DIFFERENTIAL AND IT CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT I A CAN LIKE BUILT THAT CONFIDENCE REPORT WITH THAT YOUNG PERSON SPECIAL IF THEY'RE LIKES LET. I'M TO THEN EVEN. THE PATH OF ON FOR PROP. TAKING AND SO. YEAH I. OF YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE INTO. THEIR WAKING THE- AND OTHER PER. THAT RUN A PREVENTION IN. AT A PROGRAM BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL WE DO TRY TO INTERVENE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I MEAN I THINK SOMETIMES IT COMES DOWN TO SUPPORT EDUCATION WHICH- AS- THE RISERS LEAST TALKED ABOUT- SO IDENTIFYING THAT YOUNG PERSON. FOR THAT YOU KNOW EVEN GETTING FAT AND LIKE I. I'LL JUSTICE AT PENSION SO. YOU KNOW CHILD WELFARE THINK NEEDS TO RESPOND REALLY THOUGHT FULLY TO. YOU FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS YOU KNOW IT WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT A REASON IN OF ITSELF REPORT- AND WE DON'T THINK THE CHILDREN TO BE REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES WHEN IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW ABOUT SAFETY BUT- I THINK KIND OF STARTS BEFORE THAT IDEALLY- I THINK THAT. YEAH HAVING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS RESPONDING TO ALMOST AS OBVIOUS IT'S A HUGE THING THAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW BUT- I THINK ALSO NEED TO BE A LOT MORE COMMUNITY EDUCATION AROUND. NINE ONE IS NOT THE RIGHT NUMBER WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY WHO'S POOR YOU KNOW WHAT HE MEANS LIKE. THAT IS NOT BAD WHAT THE RESOURCES ARE FOR AND IT DEFINITELY MEANS AT LATIMES. POLICE HAVE TO THAN ACTIVE SOCIAL WORKERS WHICH IS NOT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. YEAH I THINK THE WE CAN CUT. A LOT OF OUR- YEAH G. INTO. THOSE WRITTEN QUE MANAGER AWAY FROM CA JUSTICE FOR. IT REALLY JUST MUCH BETTER OUT IN ON THIS YEAH THE SECOND PART OF THAT. ALSO IS ONCE. A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND UP ON THE STREETS YOU END UP WITH THE DRUGS COMING INTO PLACE IN THE QUEUE TIED IN THE HOLD OPIOID EPIDEMIC TOTALLY HE- CRAZY AMOUNTS OF METHAMPHETAMINES THAT ARE COMING. IN FROM THE CARTELS INTO OUR STATE. AND FROM THE YOUTH PERSPECTIVE HOW DO YOU SEE WHICH IS A HERE ALL THE TIME. IF THESE PEOPLE ARE ON DRUGS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO GET THE HELP BUTTON BECAUSE YOU YOU'VE GOT A BREAK THROUGH AND YOU'VE GOT A BILL THAT REPORT YOU READY TO ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS WE LEARNED ON THE CASE MANAGEMENT CITING CAPTAIN IN A- LOS. BY IF SOMEBODY'S. NOT OF THAT MENTAL. CAPACITY BECAUSE- THEY'RE LIKE. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. BECAUSE I'D RATHER GO GET HIGH. HOW DO. AT WHAT POINT DO YOU CAN AGO OKAY DUDE. YOU'RE GONNA GET HELP I THINK A LOT OF TIMES IT COMES DOWN TO- BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE INTERVENTION WHEN THE YOUNG PERSON IS READY SO WHAT I SEE A LOT OF TIMES IS I'M YOU KNOW AB. OUT A DROP IN CENTER FOR LEE AND THE IT I THOUGHT CASES THIS IN PERSON LIKE HEY CAN LIKE YOU READY TO GET CLEANINGS LIKE DO YOU HAVE A PLACE FOR ME TO LIVE AND THEY WERE AT AN IMPASSE RIGHT I THINK THAT GOES BACK TO YOU. AND HOW FIRST I THINK YOU'RE REALLY. FIRST THING FOR TO MAKE FORGETTING ALL THE OTHER THINGS ARE NEEDED. TO A YET. PERSON SUCCESS ON HOUSING SO I THINK THE- HOUSING FOR SHOULDN'T. MUTUALLY EXCUSE EXCLUSIVE OF THESE OTHER KIND. LIKE RICH CASE MANAGEMENT EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS. I THINK THAT THOSE ALSO HAVE TO BE ROBUSTLY FUNDED AND SUPPORTED LOCALLY. I THINK THAT. BECAUSE ON THE- LONG WAIT LIST. FOR SO MANY OF OUR- YOU KNOW MEAGER KIND OF OFFERINGS AROUND HELPING WITH ABOUT THE EMERGENCY SHUT. FOR TRANSITIONAL. LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS. OF LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN REALLY I A PER SIDE THAT SERVICE WE THE YOUNG. IS READY AND LOOK LIKE OKAY IF YOU'RE READY TO. GET CLEAN BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET TO TRANSITION HELPING FOR SIX TO NINE MONTHS IT'S JUST GONNA BE SUCH A YOU KNOW A MORE SEVERE PROBLEM AT THAT POINT SAID HE THINKS THE BIGGEST POINT OF. MISTER MATHIS THE TRANSITIONAL SORRY MADAM CHAIR AND HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND I DO WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE TIME FOR ALL OF OUR PANELS- AND- YOU WERE TO GIVE AN OPENING STATEMENT. I'M GONNA TAKE THAT IS YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. BUT MADAM SHIP VERY GOOD. I AM THE VICE CHAIR SO I LIKE TO ASK DO YOU SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE- THE BIG POINT. OF THE OF THE LACKING IS THAT WITH THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. YEAH SO DO YOU KNOW NATIONALLY WE KIND OF SHIFTED AWAY FROM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OPTIONS THERE WAS SORT OF. I THINK- IT REALLY FELL OUT OF FAVOR IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM WITHOUT WAS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT YOUTH AND ADULTS IN PARTICULAR. AND THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT FOR USING AN ADULT IT IS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY VERTICALLY BECAUSE IT TENDS TO BE A LONGER TERM. TO I MEAN IF THINK ABOUT IT. THERE'S EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. A LOT OF TIMES THEY WON'T BE SUPPORTED WELL IN LIKE A THIRTY DAY OR- YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS TYPE OF INTERVENTION. BECAUSE THEY WON'T HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR- YOU KNOW EITHER LIKE EDUCATION OR EMPLOYMENT PEOPLE TO AFFORD REGULATE RENT AFTER. A SMALL INTERVENTION LIKE THAT SO. YEAH I DO THINK THAT THAT'S- YEAH SICKENING. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS. AS VICE CHAIR I REALLY% I DO APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOU'VE BEEN WORKING LONG AND HARD ON THE SUBJECTS I APPRECIATE THAT THE QUESTIONS I'M IS LIMóN THANK YOU AT THIS SO THANK YOU FOR A TEACHER PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW- OF WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE IN LOOKS LIKE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK TO SOME OF THE POINTS WERE MADE ON ABOUT TO UP ENFORCEMENT HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND IS SERVING IT THANK OF. WAVE IN THE CASE JUST WHAT ARE NOT FEELING EVERY RIGHT ALONG THAT IT WHETHER IT'S WITH CAO FAIR FOR OUR CITY POLICE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME I'M TALKING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE THAT'S THE CALLS THAT COME. AND ARE AGENCIES CAN'T IN SOME SOME M. KEPT IN SOME INSTANCES THEY ACTUALLY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE INFORMATION AND IN OTHERS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COURTNEY INFORMATION GOING THROUGH- AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT AND I REPRESENT INSURANCE SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES- AND TO THINK THAT THERE'S THIS INVISIBLE LINE WHERE YOU WHO ARE HOMELESS OR ONE WHO IS KIND IT STAYS WITHIN SENATE BILL ONE. IT HAPPENED TIMES WERE I KNOW WE WANT TO SAY GOSH DID THEY HAVE SIR ELSEWHERE OUR THERE THINGS THAT WE DO TO THIS HAPPENED THIS IS NOT. I'M SO I SHE BACK COM DO YOU THINK AFTER MORE ON THAT FOR A I AM WORKING A BILL ASSEMBLY BUILT SEVENTY TO PAY AND HOW WE CAN THIS. UP THE. AND WE WANT. JUST WITH ANY FROM QUE COUNT. I DO APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS A NAME THANK THAT ALSO OF YOUR TO KIND FROM US WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. THE. WHAT WAS THAT THE NUMBER OF. TWENTY TWO TWENTY. THE MALL BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S THESE RECORDED AFRICA'S WE KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING AND WE DON'T DUPLICATE SERVICES SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT PARTICULAR GO I HAVE A QUESTION- DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA TO SUPPORT THE ARMORY OF THE RAPID RE HOUSING- AFFECTED FOR BLACK TINO- YOU. SIR ATTITUDES. BUT I'VE I KNOW THERE OTHER FOLKS ARE ON FUTURE PANELS THAT- HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE OF RAPID RE HOUSING IN PARTICULAR SO MAYBE IF ANYBODY ON THE PANEL THAT'S LISTENING THAT CAN ANSWER YEAH THAT COULD. ON IT I'M SO YEAH I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT DATA YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE STATE A KIND OF SPOTTY SOMETIME SO RIGHT IS AND WE'RE ALL YOU KNOW WORKING TO TRY TO THE NUMBERS. AND CERTAINLY. ON THE NIGHT NUMBER YOUTH ON THE STREET WHO TORIES ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENT BUT I HAVE A WHOLE PARENTS WITH YOU. AS WELL THAT WE HAVE TO TRY TO GET OUR ARMS ARE. TRY TO BUY SO. TO THEM. YOU KNOW ONE WHAT WHEN I WENT THE SECOND ASK HOW FROM ME. I WILL. IN ORDER FOR US TO ADDRESS ISSUE REALLY. AND IS MONEY. THE REAL SHE ALL. RIGHT IS IT. TOO WHAT IT WE THOUGHT FOR SURE IN DOLLARS WILL SOLVE THIS ISSUE RIGHT- AND I. DIDN'T KNOW IF MONEY IS THE FACT THE ISSUE YEAH RIGHT. YOUR IT IS WITH IT OVER YEAH I DO THINK THAT HOMELESSNESS IS SOLVABLE AND I THINK THAT IT IS ABOUT INVESTING OUR RESOURCES WISELY THANK IF POSSIBLE. I WOULD ALSO SAY THOUGH I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GETTING TO IS THAT THERE IS A STRUCTURAL PIECES OF THIS THAT WE NEED TO BE TAKING A LOOK ABSOLUTELY. PRECISE YOU. CLEARLY SOME SYSTEM. ISSUES YEAH MS QUIRK SILVA. THANK YOU ALL OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS- THERE'S A FEW THOUGHTS THAT I HAVE AND- I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT OLD SCHOOL IS A NEW SCHOOL BECAUSE AGAIN I THAT WAS NOW IMAGERY. PEERS AND YEARS AGO THE STATE HAD A PROGRAM CALLED THE HEALTHY START PROGRAM. AND IT WAS REALLY BIG AND I KNOW I'M MY COLLEAGUE MISTER GIPSON WILL BE RUNNING A NEW BILL A RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM BUT THE HEALTHY START PROGRAM WAS SET UP. IN SCHOOLS. TO PARTNER WITH IN THE COMMUNITY NOT TO BUILD NEW PROGRAMS BUT TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY TO BUILD A COAL. ORDER TO TAKE- ADVANTAGE AND BUILD RELATIONSHIPS OF RESOURCE IS ALREADY IN YOUR COMMUNITY SO FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY YEARS AGO I WAS THE HEALTHY START CO COORDINATOR- WITHIN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A TEACHER ON SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT. SO I WORK I'M- FOR EXAMPLE WITH OUR ASSISTANCE LEAGUE TO HELP BRING MEALS INTO FOR FAMILIES OR FOR UNIFORMS WE WORK WITH OUR OPTOMETRY SCHOOL TO BRING AYE AYE GLASS- EXAMINATIONS FOR STUDENTS BUT THAT MODEL ALSO WORKED. DOING THINGS LIKE MINING FAMILIES UP FOR A TIME. AT THAT POINT IT WAS CALLED HEALTHY FAMILIES INSURANCE THE POINT OF ALL OF THIS WAS THERE WAS A MODEL ON THE SCHOOL BASE WHICH IS REALLY BEAT THE TRUSTED AREA FOR FAMILIES COMMUNITY BATES OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE OUT ABOUT. UP FOR HOME. THE VERB SHOULD BE LESS IT'S MANY TO BE WITHIN THE SCHOOLS. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE FIRST PEOPLE THEY WILL TALK TO IS MAYBE A TEACHER AT A CONFERENCE MAYBE- SOMEBODY AT THE FRONT DESK SCHOOL I AND THAT IS. THE FIRST THING SO I'M GONNA DO REALLY FAST MY P. PROPOSALS TO SOLVE THIS AT THE PLAY WITH WORDS AS A TEACHER SO HERE'S MY PROPOSAL THAT'S THE FIRST WORD MY PROPOSAL NUMBER ONE. I DID PERFECTION AND FOR GEN IF WE CAN KEEP THE- BALL TO AN FAMILIES FROM GETTING INTO HOMELESSNESS IN THE FIRST. PLACE THAT'S A HUGE STEP ONCE THEY BECOME MOST AS WE ADD THAT MUCH MORE WORK TO IT SO LEARNING ABOUT THE FAMILIES THAT ARE AT RISK AND I GUARANTEE YOU THERE ARE SCHOOLS OUT THERE UNDER REPORTING AND I HAVE A BILL. WE GET THIS FROM CAN TELL WHY. REMARK REPORT BECAUSE THEN THEY WOULD BE RESPONSE FOR ANY TO DO SOMETHING I'M SORRY I'M AN EDUCATOR I LOVE EDUCATION I'M A TEACHER MY CELL. WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE AMONG THE JEFF THE- THINGS. SO. TEN TO BE. YES OF HOMELESS MCKAY AND THE NEXT THE OVER ANNA THERE'S 20% REAP NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE SOMEBODY'S REPORTING SO I JUST GONNA YOU TO PARTNERSHIP SOME IS HOW START PROGRAM IS BASED IN A SCHOOL WHERE YEAH I HAVE YOUR TRUST PARKER THEIR FROM FREE K. THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL IT'S GOING TO IT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. HI THERE'S ALL OVER THIS. BUT WHERE TO MOST FOR GO FAMILY CENTER OVER THESE TYPE OF PLACES ARE WERE FAMILY START TO TRUST PEOPLE- AND THEN MAKING SURE THERE SOME TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARENTS EARLY ON. SO THAT STUDENTS. WHEN THEY BECOME TEENAGERS WHICH ARE VERY DIFFICULT FOR EVEN THE BEST FAMILIES- THEY HAVE THAT COMMUNICATION THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO KEEP THEIR CHILD WITHIN THEIR FAMILY. SO THAT'S ANOTHER PEOPLE ART SHIPS PREVENTION PROTECTION AND PROTECTION FOR THESE FAMILIES BUT I'M JUST GOING TO END WITH ONCE YOU GET THE PARENTS INVOLVED THEN YOU CAN START CREATING THESE PATHWAYS WHICH IS ANOTHER P. WORD. THESE PATHWAYS ARE THE WASTE SAY OKAY RIGHT NOW YOU NEED ASSISTANCE BUT HERE ARE THE WAYS WE CAN MOVE YOU FOR ONE MONTH TO A NOT NEXT TWENTY CLASSES ALL THESE THINGS WHETHER IT BE FOR THE YOUNGER. FAULT MADE IT GAVE SCHOOL. I'M SINCE THEN BECAUSE THE FIRST PLACE WERE KIDS GET A TROUBLE IN WAY. YOU CAN ANSWER BACK BECAUSE UNDER THE COOL THANK BUT IN SCHOOL LOT OF TO ARE NOT ENGAGING SO WE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE SCHOOL TO CREATE THESE PATHWAYS UP AND IF WE DO THAT MY LIPS PEAS WE'RE GOING TO GIVE FAMILIES AND YOUNG ADULTS POSSIBILITIES AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO CREATE AS POSSIBILITIES. THAT THEY HAVE A FUTURE TO BELIEVE ARE CALIFORNIA DREAM. THANK YOU MISS QUIRK SILVA THERE WAS NO QUESTION THERE ARE NO. A CHAIRMAN TO THANK YOU I JUST WANNA SAID NEXT ST NICK SOME I HAVE TO PERSUADE PEOPLE PERFECTLY. I'M GONNA ASK MS QUIRK SILVA TO FIGURE OUT MY BRANDING. I HAVE A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY FOR A SUPERVISORS POLICE AND IT'S AROUND THE INTERSECTION AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES SO WE KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS AND THE HOUSING CHALLENGES ARE OFTEN OF A BREAKDOWN OF DIFFERENT SILO WISED POLICY AREAS SO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FAILS FOLKS BECOME HOMELESS THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM FAILS. KIDS BECOME HOMELESS THE HEALTH CARE SO FAIL. AND WE'VE HOMELESSNESS OUT. EVEN THE HELLO OF HIS WRIST. ARE THE COW LEVEL DO YOU SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THIS CAN BETTER WE THE COUNTY LEVEL TO. FOR US TO AND SENT. YOUR COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES TO THINK IN THOSE STYLIZED AREAS HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS ABOUT TO RELEASE SOMEONE OR SIX A JUVENILE PROBATION ABOUT TO RELEASE. ACT AS IT THAT THEIR INCENTIVE TO THINK. WITH HOMELESS ADVOCATES AND HOMELESS PROVIDERS AND OTHER. AGENCIES DEAL WITH HOMELESSNESS HAD WE PROACTIVELY ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS SOME WONDERING. IN THE CURRENT JUSTICE CONTACTS AND HEALTH CARE CONTEXT FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. WHAT'S ON JUST ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE I THINK AB ONE NINE. I OF RETOOL. SAID YOU KNOW OF THAT MONEY TO THE THROUGH REALIGNMENT SO PART OF IT IS WHILE PEOPLE ARE IN OUR CUSTODY AND THEY COULD BE THAT EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN YEAR OLD. IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET SERVICED THERE WHILE THEY'RE IN OUR CARE. MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION TRAINING ANY OF THAT IN ANY IF THERE'S ANY ADDICTIONS OR WHATEVER MAKING SURE WHEN THEY LEAVE THOSE PREMISES WHETHER IT BE IN PROP A PROBATION CAP. AS ONE EXAMPLE YOUTH OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE CONNECTING INSIDE A FULLY AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS ON THE OUTSIDE AND THERE'S A LACK OF FUNDING FOR THAT. BECAUSE EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE PUT IN FORMULAS AND BE DONE WITH. YOUR RESPECTIVE JUST WHAT. PEOPLE YOUR IN. ENOUGH REAL HELP INCENTIVE. AND CREATIVELY LOOK AT OTHER MECHANISM SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WE'VE CREATED FUNDING- TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CALL- DR SO LOOKING AT OF. RICK LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO INCENTIVIZE INDIVIDUALS FROM NOT GOING BACK AND COMMITTING ANOTHER CRIME. SO MAKING SURE THROUGH DIVERSION AND RE ENTRY THAT WERE ALSO EXPANDING THAT FOR YOUTH AND LOOKING AT IT FOR. THAT ARE COMING OUT OF OUR IT'S TO AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THEY TO TREAT. IT LEAVE SAY ME. UP TWELVE DAY OF BEING IN. UP AN EXAMPLE MAYBE THERE WAS INFRACTION OR COULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THEY WERE HOMELESS AND THEY- THEY WROTE ABOUT CHECKER THEY TOOK SOMETHING WE TRIED IT. THEM WITH. COMMUNITY THAT'S TOUGH. RIGHT THERE. WE HAVE THAT CA AND THAT WE CAN'T. A BODY OF INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO HELP PROVIDE A TREATMENT WHERE IT'S NEEDED THE MOST AND WE DON'T GET FUNDING NECESSARILY AT AND I THINK SOMETIMES THE NINETIES WERE GIVEN. A YOU KNOW A AND FOR A THEIR- THAT I'M ON THIS SIDE. OF UNFUNDED MANDATES SO THERE IS A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS THAT COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO- FEEL I FEEL VERY FIRST. TIME BECAUSE WE ARE WE AGREED THERE'S A PROBLEM. IN TERMS OF GET IN THERE IN THE- STATE OF THAT IN THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING AND ABILITY TO ME. ITS OVER WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT YET. TO BE TORIA SO HELL ANSWER THIS IS A COOL. WITH OUR CHILD WELFARE SO ARE PER SYSTEM AND ALL OF THAT WE'RE DOING THAT AT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WHERE WE HAVE OUR THREE AGENCIES NOW IN ONE INTEGRATED SYSTEM. AND I AND I BELIEVE THAT YOUR START YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE STARTING TO DO THAT AS WELL. BUT THAT MORE HAS TO BE SAID ABOUT LOCAL FIRM. BEING OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE JUST AS BIG OR CONFRONTING ISSUE SHE BE LOOKING AT WAYS OF IN A- THE WAY WE LOOK AT AN ISSUE SO IT ISN'T. ALL OF. THIS CHURCH AND SALAS FIVE CENTS FOR SO NOW IT'S YOUR PROBLEM NO LET'S GET IT HOLISTICALLY COULD YOU I'M OF CARE BRENT TRIED TO. COME UP WITH A WORKS AT. ACE IN IT'S OUT THERE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE OTHER PAY BUT ON THAT BEEN OF MY FRUSTRATION BUT I THINK THERE'S WAYS OF GETTING AROUND IT AND MAKING SURE THAT IT WHEN WE DO PUT UP ANY KIND OF- HOUSING THAT WE INCLUDE IN THERE ALWAYS PREVENTION TOOLS NO MATTER WHAT BUT ALSO AGAIN THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE REALLY- MAKE MAKE CASES SUCCESS FOR THE INVESTORS AND WE CAN'T JUST THINK ABOUT IT AND WHAT WORKS FOR TO THE ADDITIONAL. MAIL BLOCKING A SIX. WHEN YOU'RE ALL WE'RE TAUGHT ABOUT THE FOURTEEN THROUGH YEAR OLD TO MAYBE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX THAT'S WHAT YOUR REPORT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THAT'S A DIFFERENT SITUATION SAID OF SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FACED WITH- BUT THEY STILL HAVE CHALLENGES SOME OF THEM STILL NEED- ARE ARE STILL NOT FULLY DEVELOPED IN TERMS OF THEIR MATURITY- SO YOU CAN'T JUST OUR SYSTEM SAYS AFTER A CERTAIN AGE. YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. MAYBE WE MADE SOME MISTAKES ABOUT. LAW MAYBE OUR LAWS HAVE TO BE CHANGED TO ROUTE TO ROUTE TO ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT THAT YOUNGSTER THAT PERSON. THEY NEEDED A SUPPORT THAT THEY DESERVE. BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE THEY HAVE- COME INTO A SITUATION WHERE ALL THE SYSTEMS HAVE HAVE NOT WORK FOR THEM. AND IT ISN'T NECESSARILY THAT YOUNGSTERS FALL. I'M CASES SO I'M JUST I'M JUST SAYING WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE. MY PLEASURE THAT IT. IS A CLOSING COMMENT AS A FARMER SO. MYSELF I DEFINITELY HEAR THAT- THE SITUATION RUN UNFUNDED MANDATES AND IT IS MY PERSPECTIVE THAT WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED A GOOD SHARE OF MONEY WE I THINK SHOULD BE INVESTING A SIGNIFICANT MORE AMOUNT OF MONEY ONE- BUT TO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BOTH STREAMLINED AND REALIGN. EVERYONE'S INTEREST SO THAT WERE CUT ACROSS SILOS AND WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARD THE SAME GOALS. AND THE THREE ONCE WE'VE DONE THAT ONCE WE PROVIDED MONEY IN REAL LIFE WE'VE GOT A-ALL. HOLDER CELLS OCCUR AT ALL LEVELS. THE COUNTY STATES. SHE DOES COME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISS HIGH I REALLY APPRECIATE WILL THE COMETS YOU MADE HARM REDUCTION EFFORTS- WHAT NOT ONLY ARE OR DO WE SEE THAT OUR YOUTH ARE HARMING THEMSELVES BUT WE AS A SOCIETY ARE ALSO CAUSING HARM TO APPRECIATE THAT IS AN EMPHASIS THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT I THANK YOU FOR THAT- MISS SUDDEN.

I APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENT REGARDING THE STATE WIDE WAREHOUSE TO COLLECT DATA I WILL TELL YOU THAT A THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION AND- IT WAS ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THAT. AND THEY CAME TO SEE ME AND ASKED ME TO THE BILL SPECIFICALLY ON THAT BECAUSE WERE FINE. IF WE OWE THAT ARE FOR YOU ARE OVER IN THE SYSTEM. WHY IS IT THAT WE CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE BECOME HOMELESS WHY IS IT THAT WE CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY OF THEM NEED FOR THEIR SERVICES IT IF WERE WORKING IN SILOS IT BECOMES A PROBLEM. JUST RECENTLY- SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON- HOSTED A THREE DAY CONFERENCE ARE RISING TIDES SO.

SO I RESORTED TO CAP CHOPPING WITH PEOPLE I BARELY KNOW. DURING THE TIME THAT I WAS HOMELESS I WAS EXPOSED TO PEOPLE DOING DRUGS. AT THE TIME THAT I WAS DOING. AT THE TIME THAT I WAS HOMELESS I WAS ALSO DOING ONLINE DATING JUST TO FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP FOR A NIGHT. WHICH LED TO UNSAFE SITUATIONS. AFTER FIVE MONTHS I'VE GOTTEN TO RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS HIGHLY ABUSIVE. I WAS EXPERIENCING THE LOGICAL TIONAL PHYSICAL FINANCIAL ABUSE. BUT BECAUSE I HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO I WAS FORCED TO STAY. BE FORCED INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP DUE TO HOMELESSNESS LET ME DOWN A PATH. THAT RESULTED IN THE ATTEMPT OF MY OWN LIFE. DUE TO HOMELESSNESS THE SITUATION THAT RESULTED FROM IT MY ACADEMICS ALSO BEGAN TO SUFFER. I GOT TO SEE IS A MY FIRST SEMESTER AND THE FOLLOWING NEXT SEMESTER I ADORED SO MUCH ABUSE MIGRAINES EARNED WEREN'T FC AND A D. AND A WITHDRAWAL. I WAS PLACED ON ACADEMIC PROBATION TWICE AND WAS REMOVED PLACE ON DISMISSAL BLECKLEY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE HOW IMPORTANT HOUSING IS FALL TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN SEMESTER I WAS TAKING FIVE CLASSES AS A FULL TIME STUDENT. AND IT JUST STARTED A JOB AND I PASSED WITH STRAIGHT EIGHTH. I AM AN EXCELLENT STUDENT BUT WHEN HOUSING IS UNRELIABLE AND YOUTH ARE FACING HOMELESSNESS EVERYTHING AROUND THEM SUFFERS. THE YEAR I WAS IN PLACEMENT MY CATION OF NOT SLIP THROUGH THE CAR THROUGH THE CRACKS I EXPERIENCE THE FILLED ADOPTION DUE TO EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL ABUSE. THE ROLE OF CHILD THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WAS TO ENSURE I WAS PLACED BACK INTO THE SYSTEM AND RECEIVED ASSISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE TIME THAT I WAS IN CARE. RECEIVING SERVICES WHILE I WAS IN CARE WOULD HAVE MEANT I WAS IN CARE LEGALLY LEADING TO THE FULFILLMENT OF ALL AB TWELVE REQUIREMENTS UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS NOT THE CASE WHICH LED TO MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH HOME. THIS EVENT WILL HELP ME WITH MY BIOLOGICAL FAMILY ESPECIALLY MY DAD'S BROTHER. I'VE KNOWN THEM FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW. THEY FOUND MY SIBLINGS AND I THROUGH FACEBOOK AND REACHED OUT AND OFFER THEIR HOME TO ME AFTER MY RELATIONSHIP ENDED. IF HOUSING SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE TO ME I WOULD HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY BE STABLE ON MY OWN. AND NOT BEEN PUT ABOVE SITUATION OF SURVIVAL. I WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAFETY NECESSARY TO ALLOW ME TO START MY COLLEGE CAREER ON THE RIGHT TRACK. MANY YOUTH DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO ADAPT TO THE ADULT WORLD WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN AND EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS I SURELY DIDN'T. LEARNING NEW SKILLS TAKES TIME AND SUPPORT. I WAS FORTUNATE MY BIOLOGICAL FAMILY FOUND AND OFFERED HELP TO ME BUT NOT ALL YOUTH EXPERIENCE THIS FOR THE YOUTH WHO DO NOT HAVING A BUDGET AND SERVICES SET ASIDE FOR HOMELESSNESS. CAN GIVE THEM TIME IN A PSYCHOLOGICAL IF PLACE TO LEARN THE SKILLS NEEDED FOR THEM IN THE ADULT WORLD. WHEN I FIRST WENT TO THE HOMELESS SHELTER I REMEMBER ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WITH THE SAME TO STAY WAS TO LOOK FOR EMPLOYMENT OR POOL. AT THE TIME NO I WAS STRUGGLING SCHOOL AND COULDN'T EVEN FATHOM WORKING DUE TO MY MENTAL HEALTH STRUGGLES. YOUTH NEED SPECIFIED SERVICE. I NEED TO SPECIFY PROCESS. AS A YOUTH WE ARE STARTING OFFER LAP INTO BEING AN ADULT AND THAT'LL BONE IS FOR TRANSIT. ADDING STRUGGLE BEING HOME MAKES IS MUCH DE. I'M ASKING YOU SUPPORT THE BUDGET SET ASIDE FOR YOU TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS. HOUSING AND SERVICES THAT ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW THEM A SECOND CHANCE. AND FOR SOME IT COULD PREVENT TOXIC AND UNSAFE SITUATIONS BEFORE THEY BEGIN. THANK YOU. OR JUST A MOMENT THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT- WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT EXPERTS TODAY BUT YOUR EXPERTISE IS DRAWN FROM. THE VERY INTENSELY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT AND- AND HELPING IT TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDING THAT SERVICE. THANK YOU. MYSTERY BE. WHEN IS THERE LEAVE IT WAS FAMILY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW WE GOT WHERE WE ARE IN THIS HOUSING CRISIS SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU THE THING I REMIND REMIND MYSELF IS TEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE NO SERVICES FOR HOMELESS YOUTH IN SEMINOLE COUNTY FAIRFIELD COUNTY IS THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE NATION WE HAVE A POPULATION OF OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE AND THERE WAS NOT ONE SINGLE LOCATION FOR HOMELESS YOUTH WE DIDN'T HAVE SHELTERS WE DIDN'T HAVE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. WE DON'T HAVE DROP IN CENTERS NOTHING AND WITH OUR AGENCY BECAME INVOLVED WITH THAT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THIS IS A GAP IN SERVICES AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS AS WE GOT MORE INVOLVED WE WERE ABLE TO GET. FUNDING AND THEN WE WILL. FIND AN FOR. FIRST SO WE OPERATED ON SOME FELL FUNDING AND SOME FOUND. FUND AND- UP UNTIL NOW BERNADINO COUNTY STILL HAS NOT SPENT ANY MONEY THAT THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY FORCED TO SPEND. ON HELPING HOME HERE. SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE HEAT FUNDING WHEN IT CAME AVAILABLE THAT 5% SET ASIDE WAS REQUIRED. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID THEY SET ASIDE FIVE PERCENT. AND WITH THAT 5% WE WERE ABLE TO ADD TRANSIT HOUSING SO OUR AGENCY CURRENTLY. WE HAVE A SHELTER FOR HOMELESS. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF OPENING A SECOND SHELTER FOR HOMELESS YOUTH. WE HAD IT WE HAD FORTY BEDS OF TRADITIONAL HOUSING. AND WITH THE HEAT FUNDING WE ARE AT THE ABLE TO ADD TWELVE MORE. WE ALSO HAVE THREE DROP IN CENTERS THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS. ADDING TO MORE OF THOSE WHO WERE AYE PROVIDING A RANGE OF SERVICES FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE. STARTED RECRUITING. MORE IT SEATS AND- EIGHT. THAT ARE. A J. BUT YOU. SAMPLE LETTER THROUGH OR AGENTS OR- ORGANS. WHERE THEY PROVIDING. JOB TRAINING SERVICES OR THEIR PROVIDING PROBATE CANCER. HELP THEM EARN AT ALL WITH ARAFAT. NEED HELP. WELL TO BAN SERVICES INTO THE AIR. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THAT I'VE LOVED ABOUT WHAT WE DO THE IS TO WORK WITH THE K. I GET JOY OF GETTING TO TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE CODY EVERYDAY AND- THEY ARE. RICH AND THAT'S US IS OUT TO ME ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED I'M A MARINE AND WHEN I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS ONE OF THINGS THAT I LEARNED IF YOU DON'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND AND EVEN IF THERE EVEN IF YOU'RE BEING SHOT AT YOU LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND. THESE KIDS DO THAT THESE PEOPLE WILL RATHER SLEEP THEIR CAR WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND GO TO A PROGRAM WHERE IF THEY DON'T THINK A FRIEND IS GOING TO BE SAID. AND REALLY THEY REALLY HAVE THAT CONCERN THAT CARE FREE OTHER WHICH I THINK IS. OOPS REBEL WITH THE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T MAY MATES I LEARN TO BE A GOOD ROOM WHEN I WAS NOT BEING A GOOD ROOMMATE WHILE I WAS IN THE MARINE CORPS AND MY PLATOON SERGEANT MADE ME SLEEP IN A TENT IN THE YARD AND TELL I COULD LEARN HOW TO GET ALONG WITH MY ROOMMATES WE ALL NEED TO LEARN THAT AND WE HELP OUR KIDS LEARN THAT THAT'S A VERY NOBLE SKILL BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A HELP GET PAST THE OTHER ONE IS- EMPLOYEE. GRAY EMPLOYMENT. THERE THAT TEACH GET. YOUNG PEOPLE. HOW TO. APPLY A JOB HOW TO WRITE A RESUME AND HOW TO DO THAT WHAT THEY DON'T TEACH THEM IS HOW TO DEAL WITH THE DEPRESSION OF REJECTION. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS SOMETHING I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER DO BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EVERY TWO YEARS I HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE DECIDED. YOU'RE NOT ANYMORE. I HEAR THAT. LIKE EGO JUST TO FRACK I DON'T THINK I COULD DO WHAT YOU GUYS DO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THERE ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND EMPLOYMENT AND THERE AND PART OF THE REASON THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND EMPLOYMENT THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB HISTORY. YOU DON'T HAVE SECURE HOUSING THE HAVE THE PROPER. THE THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING ON THERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF ACTION AND IF ANY OF YOU EVER BEEN UNEMPLOYED YOU KNOW THAT YOU GET REJECTED A LOT AND WE NEED WE DO A LOT OF CHEERLEADING FOR CATS YOU KNOW WE HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THEY GO TO APPLY AND THEY GET REJECTED THAT'S OKAY THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOU WHICH MEANS THAT WE NEED. GO MORE I MAY IT WAS A FOR YOU WE DON'T FIND IN WE WERE TO BEST JOB FOR YOU AT HOW TO BE OPEN TO THAT PROCESS THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAD SO WOMAN THE TALK OUT CASE BEEN IMPORTANT CASE COMPLY WITH. BACK IT BATCH. OF THE ACT. IF YOU CAN AND HOUSING IF YOU DON'T EMPLOYEE AND YOU CAN'T AND EMPLOYMENT IF YOU DO HAVE HOUSE CASE MANAGEMENT IMPORTANT BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A FOR THIS TO LIVE WHILE WE'RE THAT MANAGE THAN MANAGER ISN'T VERY% EFFECTIVE SO THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE- IT'S NICE TO SEE I THINK WE'RE AT AN EXCITING TIME WORKING WITH HOMELESS YOUTH. AND THE REASON I SEE THAT IS IT'S ON THE FOREFRONT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT FINALLY TEN YEARS AGO I COULDN'T ANYONE TO TALK TO US ABOUT IT AND TODAY IT'S RIGHT ON THE FRONT PAGE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS IN THAT AREA IS EXCITING TO SEE THAT PROGRESS- I WAS ASKED. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HEAT FUNDING- WHEN WE RECEIVE THAT FUNDING WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE GOTTEN FUNDING FROM OUR LOCAL CONTINUUM OF CARE- ALL OF THE HEAD FUNDING THAT COMES INTO OUR COUNTY IN OUR CONTINUUM. GOES STRAIGHT TO A DAHLE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AND VETERANS I'M A VETERAN I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT ALSO I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE NEED A LITTLE HELP IN THAT AREA. SO IS EXCITED THAT THE SET ASIDE THIS ALLOWED US TO ADD THOSE NEW BEDS. I CAN ALREADY POINT TO- AT LEAST ONE KID WHO IS. IN RIGHT NOW. HE ONE OF THE JOY. I GOT IT HE- UNTIL HE CON TO SOME HOOPS. AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET A MENTOR HE HOUSING PROGRAM AND THEN HELP INTO THAT PROCESS. AND NOW HE'S A BOOT CAMP AND NOW HE'S GOT HIS. HIS PACK ON HIS GOING ON THIS PATH AND HE'S DOING GREAT STUFF I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. SEVERAL I COULD GO FOR AN HOUR. ABOUT THE- THAT WE'VE BEEN A TO MAKE THESE GREAT PROGRESS WITH. EXCITING TO SEE THOSE BACK GROWTH. TWO LAST THINGS THAT WE DID WANT TO COMMENT ON- THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IS A BODY AND YOU GUYS ALL KNOW HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS. HI DO HAS DONE IT I THINK A REALLY OUTSTANDING THING AYE AYE IT'S BEEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS OR SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS BUT- THE CONTINUUM OF CARE DECIDES WHAT THE PRIORITIES. THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY IS. AND THEN CONTRACTS GOOD. PLEA FROM HUD TO THE NONPROFIT. I THINK THAT SYSTEM HAS WORKED REALLY WELL AND THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO USE IT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE STATE ASSEMBLY. THIS AN AIDE TO CUT MAYBE MODEL THAT SAME PROCESS BECAUSE THAT THIS HEAT FUNDING AND WITH THE HELP FUNDING THE MONEY GOES TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. AT LEAST OUR CONTINUUM OF CARE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO. THERE AND THEY'RE MAKING. BUT THAT'S NOT THEIR FORTE THAT THERE REALLY STRUGGLING IN THAT AREA SO SOMETHING I'D ASK YOU TO CONSIDER. AND THE LAST THING IS WHEN TAX SEASON. AND I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE ALL PROBABLY OF EITHER PAGER TAXES ARE WORKING ON YOUR TAXES. I LOVE TAXIS AND NOW AND THE REASON I LOVE IT IS BECAUSE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH. I GOT JOBS AND FREQUENTLY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIFE THEY'VE EVER HAD A JOB. THE FOR AND THEY'VE HAD TO FILE TAX. THEY HAVE THE pGIANTS STYLES. FACE AND THEY'RE SO EXCITED BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE I'M A LEGIT HERE. NOW BILL PERSON I. TAXES AND THEN THEY GET THE THOUGHT ATTITUDE GOING LIKE I GET TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO BECAUSE I PAID A SALARY. IT'S A- RELIEF FOR. AIRING WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG. GETTING TO FILE. IS NOW WHEN THERE ARE OUR AGE THAT. WILL BE ON. BE OUT. AND ABOUT. BUT IT IS. REALLY GREAT RIGHT TO PASS THE C. PAP. TICKET FOR THAT. THANK YOU. I WANT TO APOLOGIZE AT THE OUTSET I HAVE A LONG SCHEDULE THREE O'CLOCK APPOINTMENT. BUT BEFORE I TURN IT BACK OVER TO- MY FELLOW CULTURE I WANT TO WELCOME- MS REGAN FROM ONE OF MY GREAT SAN FRANCISCO ORGANIZATIONS AND JUST HELP FALLING. STORY TO OUR COLLEAGUES. SO ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO I WAS ASKED TO CARRY LEGISLATION TO BUILD A TRANSITION AGE YOUTH. PROJECT IN- WHAT IS KNOWN AS A VERY ECONOMICALLY SUCCESSFUL NEIGHBORHOOD IN MY CITY. AND IT WAS TREMENDOUS PUSH BACK IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WAS GOING TO INVOLVE. THOSE PEOPLE COMING TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD- I WAS AMONG ALL THE ADVOCATES FOR THIS PROGRAM WE WERE THREATENED WITH MANY THINGS POLITICALLY OTHERWISE- MOVED PROJECT FOR. AND THANKS TO TREAT YOU SERVICES PROJECT. MALL ARE YOU. CRITICS SUCH AS THE PERSON BUT I STATE AND I HAVE NOT A SINGLE COMPONENT THAT PROJECT IN YEARS SO WITH THAT INTRODUCTION AS WE CAN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- I'M ACTUALLY VERY HONORED TO BE HERE AND I. WANT TO TALK ABOUT LOGAN STREET YOUTH- IN HONOR OF CODY AND- ALL OF THEIR YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO WE REPRESENT- THERE'S TOO MANY. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT. BUT NO YOUNG PERSON SHOULD EVER BE WITHOUT A STEVEN STABLE HOME- THERE ARE TOO MANY ONE IN TEN- PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND TWENTY FIVE BOOKS TRAINS HOMELESSNESS IN THIS COUNTRY- IT IS UNACCEPTABLE IT'S VERY SERIOUS BUT IT'S SOULFUL. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR LARA TRADE HAS LEARNED WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NEED TO MOVE OFF THE STREET AND INTO SUCCESSFUL LIVES. THREE THINGS. A RANGE OF DIVERSE HOUSING OPTIONS THAT ARE EASY TO GET INTO AND HARD TO FALL OUT OF. ROBUST SUPPORT SERVICES DELIVERED BY WELL TRAINED STAFF COMMITTED TO DEEPLY ENGAGING WITH YOUTH TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. AUTHENTIC AND MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEM. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW THE STATS CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF YOUTH EXT YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH SAN FRANCISCO ONE IN FIVE OR UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AGAIN UNACCEPTABLE. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND YOUTH ACCESS SERVICES AT THE ORGAN STREET EVERY YEAR. AND I WANT TO JUST REVIEW WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO IS A HOLISTIC APPROACH. WITHOUT REACHING AGENT SERVICES AND THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS. STREET OUTREACH TEAMS MEETING YOUTH WITH BASIC NEEDS ON THE STREETS GOING WHERE THEY ARE THE HARM REDUCTION APPROACH. MEANING WE MEET YOU WHERE THEY ARE BUT WE DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO. UNDERSTAND WE BRING FOOD CLOTHING HYGIENE AND WE BUILD TRUST. WE HAVE DROP IN CENTERS WHICH HAVE EXTREMELY LOW BARRIERS THEY'RE ALL WELCOME EVERYONE'S WELCOME COULD BUILD DEEPER ENGAGEMENT. IF THEY'RE NOT READY TO ACCESS SERVICES THAT'S OKAY THE COMBAT. OR HOUSING OPTIONS MERGES THE SHELTERS TIME LIMITED AND NON TIME LIMITED RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS RENTAL SUBSIDIES VOUCHERS SCATTERED SITE SHARED HOUSING. ALL OF THESE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE STEVE SUBSIDIES CHAU SUBSIDIES IT IT ALL IT'S ALL NEEDED EVERY ASPECT OF HOUSING EVERY OPTION- EVERY CREATIVE- METHOD THAT WE CAN USE. IT WITH THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOV ALL WITH ONSITE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT HEALTH CARE ONLY GOOD JUST OTHER SERVICES. EDUCATION I'M MEANT INTENSIVE INDIVIDUALIZED PLANS TO ENSURE THAT HOMELESSNESS IS NOT REOCCURRING. WE HAVE CO ARE BASED CURRICULA FOCUSED ON POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND CAREER TRACK EMPLOYMENT. WITH LIVING WAGE. WITH LONGSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS OF LOCAL EMPLOYERS COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF SAN FRANCISCO AS OF STATE AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS IN RETAIL FOOD HANDLING AND TECH. INDIVIDUAL AT COLLEGE AND JOB COUNSELING TUTORING JOB PLACEMENT INTERNSHIPS WERE WITH THEM EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY. HEALTH AND WELLNESS CRITICAL MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS THAT INCLUDE PRIMARY CARE PREVENTION EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES INCLUDING MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND TRAUMA. GROUP AN INTERVAL INDIVIDUAL SERVICES THERAPY IN SUPPORT GROUPS. AND THEN IN TASTE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT I HEARD A LOT OF. RIGHT OF REFERENCES TO CASE MANAGEMENT. AND IT'S INDIVIDUALIZED LOW THRESHOLD TO ACCESS STRENGTH BASED OUTCOMES FOCUSED AND ALWAYS EXIT PLANNING FROM THE VERY FIRST STEP EXIT PLANNING- WE LIKE TO SAY AT OREGON STREET THAT WE DON'T TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE. PERMANENTLY ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH ORCHESTRATE YOUR AN EXIT PLAN YOUR YOUR YOUR HOMELESSNESS IS BRICK. I'M YOU'RE HERE WITH US FOR THE DURATION AND AS DEEP AS YOU NEED US AND THEN WE WANT TO GET YOU OUT AND- ON YOUR OWN. ASHLEIGH'S NEEDS INCLUDING HIV POSITIVE YOUTH FOSTER YOUTH YOUTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS LGBT Q. YOUTH ENTRANCE YOU WE HAVE- WE DO RUN THE ONLY TRANSPACIFIC A HOUSING SITE IN SAN FRANCISCO. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS ARE LONG LONG TERM GOALS FOR EVERY SINGLE YOU THROUGH COME TO MARTIN ST. SAVE UNSTABLE HOUSING PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELLNESS SUSTAINABLE CAREER TRACK EMPLOYMENT AT A LIVING WAGE AND POST HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THAT PERSON. SO OUR RESULTS SO- AMONG THE YOUTH OR EXITING LARKIN STREET SO AS OF LAST YEAR 81% EXITED TO STABLE HOUSING. 60% A CHIEF PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL WELLNESS 70% WERE EMPLOYED OR ENROLLED IN SCHOOL AND THEIR AVERAGE MONTHLY INCOME WITH SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND ONE DOLLARS. FROM ZERO. THE LARGER RESULTS IN THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH. BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT OF FUNDS FROM LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL SOURCES WE ARE ACTUALLY SEEING A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS YOUTH UNDER TWENTY FIVE IN OUR ANNUAL PICK OUT. THAT'S HUGE SO FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN WE'RE SEEING A 10% DROP AND- WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS PUBLIC INVESTMENT. PUBLIC DOLLAR INVESTMENT WORKS AND WE'RE SEEING IT WE HAVE THE DATA AND THEY WANT TO. LEAVE YOU WITH PLEASE KEEP DOING IT. I TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF THE PERSON WHO LEFT EARLIER. YES IT'S ABOUT MONEY IT'S ABOUT MONEY IT'S ABOUT MONEY IS RESOURCES IT'S WE NEED MORE HOUSING BUT UNTIL WE GET LOTS AND LOTS OF HOUSING. WE AND FAMILIES THIS PROGRAM IN ALL OF MY PARTNERS IN THE SPACE. NEED AS MUCH RESOURCES AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP. SERVING YOUTH WHEN WE SOLVE FOR YOUTH HOMELESSNESS WE SOLD FOR. ALL ADULT HOMELESSNESS- IT'S A- RISING TIDE SITUATION OF WERE PREVENTING THE FUTURE. AND CAN'T POPULATION. AT THAT'S A LEVY. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES DOCTOR CHORE. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK TO HELP YOU WITH THE HOMELESS. PEOPLE. I'M GLAD OF THAT- YOU'LL PROGRAM IS WORKING AND- DECREASING IN IN THAT THAT IS- IN A OF GOOD NEWS. I WONDER IF ANYBODY HAS COLLECTED A IN THE DATA HE USED HOMELESS CATEGORIES SO WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS OF PROBABLY LARGELY THREE FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES TO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE- AT THE- ON THE STREET AND BECOME HOME NASA BECAUSE OF THE ERA. MY GUESTS THE CHOICE OF THEIR LIFESTYLE. OR BECAUSE OF ALL OF THEM. HOME SITUATION WITH THE PARENTS. OR MENTAL ILLNESS. OR OVER EIGHTEEN. MAYBE A NON WORK UNEMPLOYMENT DO YOU HAVE A CERTAIN DATA YES TO ALL OF PACKED. YES THE TOOL. AND A AND A WHAT IS THE HIGHEST A PERCENTAGE CATEGORY WHICH ONE. UP IN SAN FRANCISCO THE- THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE IT. WE HAVE- LGBTQ YOUTH AND A YOUTH OF COLOR- ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED INOUR HOME WITH YOU POPULATION SO IT'S AN INTERSECTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND VERY SYSTEMIC- RACIAL INEQUITY ON BOTH ENDS THAT SEVERELY IMPACT THESE YOU. GENERATIONAL POVERTY SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF YOUTH WHOS FAMILIES ARE POOR AND SO THEY'RE LEAVING THERE'S A HIGH A HIGH AMOUNT OF STRESS AND TRAUMA RELATED TO THAT SO THEY'RE EITHER KICKED OUT OR THEY'RE LEAVING AND OF COURSE THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. SO IT'S A IT'S AND THAT'S WHY YES TO EVERYTHING THEY GET. KICKED OUT OF THE- PARENTS HOUSE. SAYS SOME. SOME HAVE THAT THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT WE SEE AS- A LACK OF EMPLOYMENT. THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE JOB SKILLS AND THEY DON'T HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT HISTORY THEY HAVE THEY STRUGGLE FINDING EMPLOYMENT IF YOU DON'T HAVE EMPLOYMENT AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT HAVE HOUSING. IT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE HOUSING ITSELF BUT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE HOUSING. OKAY IF YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THAT IS SO- HIGHS COSTS OF FOR YOUTH ON EMPLOYMENT. WHAT APPROACH. TO HAVE YOU STARTED THAT INTRODUCED US TO. IF DOES UP UNEMPLOYMENT THE TOP SKIERS. THE THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS OUT THERE ALREADY. THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE HAD IS THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCESS THOSE HOUSE OF THOSE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF HOUSING. WHAT WE AND AS WE SEPTEMBER PROVIDE. COMPACT OF THAT AND THEN GET THEM TO SCHOOL OR TO THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS AND INTO THOSE PROGRAMS. MOST OF THE PROGRAM'S RICK. THAT CLASS. THE THREE FRIDAY FOR OF A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK WHATEVER THE IS IT'S A RECURRING OVER AND OVER THE NEED TO ATTEND SCHOOL AND THEY NEED TO STOP THEY NEED FOR SCHOOL SMELLING NICE AT ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS AND YOU DON'T GET THOSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE SO WHEN WE PROVIDE THAT HOUSING. EVERYONE HOUSING. IN OUR HOUSING PROGRAM-THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN AND USUALLY WHAT I NEED SEVENTY ONE JOB WHEN YOU FIND THEM YOU PROVIDE THE HOUSING BUT AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD TO USE ON ON ON THAT THEM RELY ON YOU AND THE YOU TO COME OUT. AND YOU CAN COME OUT THE DO THEY GO TO ST AGAIN WE DO NOT EVER KICK ANYONE OUT SO WHEN THEY OWN THEM IN MISTER MONEY ONE OF ALL YOU MENTIONED THEY'LL THEY'LL KICK YOU KNOW AND I WANT TO SAY- EXISTING JOBS IS ONE ISSUE BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE ISSUES THERE'S OF. ALL OF THE SUPPORT THERE'S- HOUSING IS A HUGE A BUT OF DEALING WITH THE TRAUMA. THE THINGS IF EVERYBODY CAN GO BACK TO WHEN THEY WERE YOU KNOW SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THAT AGE SO FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR IS THE SECOND HIGHEST. A DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE SECOND ONLY TO ZERO TO FIVE. AND IT'S THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SECOND MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS GOING ON THEN YOU LATER ON. FAMILY TRAUMA- VICTIMIZATION OF PHYSICAL ABUSE. BLACK OF HOUSING SUBSTANCE ABUSE DEPRESSION ALL THE OTHER BARRIERS. AND THEN. TO SAY- WHAT ARE YOU WORKING AT AND THEN I'M GONNA THINGS IT CAME FROM THE OUR HOME INITIAL FROM THEIR HOMES HAVING TO LEAVE EITHER BEING BORN INTO PROP POVERTY- BEING KICKED OUT OF THE FALLS OR AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. LOSING THEIR HOUSING BEING KICKED OUT OF WHERE THEY ARE HAVING TO LEAVE AN ABUSIVE SITUATION AND THEN TO SAY HOLD ON A JOB. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL THESE OTHER THINGS- ON TOP OF BEING A- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TWENTY YEAR OLD HUMAN BEING- THOSE THINGS HAVE YOU HAVE TO VOICE THAT PERSON- AND I WANT TO. JUST DO A QUICK SHOUT OUT OF IT AS FAR AS JOB TRAINING A ONE I'M A HUGE ADVOCATE OF PAYING A LIVING WAGE FOR YOUTH TO TRADE ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WE HEAR IS THAT THEY WANT TO GO TO TRAINING BUT- I HAVE TO MAKE MONEY SO I HAVE TO GET X. TO KEEP MY JOB SO I CAN. YOU KNOW KEEP GETTING MY SUBSIDY IN WE NEED TO JUST REALLY. OF THIS BECAUSE EFFORT PAY LIVING WAGES BUT PARTICULARLY FOR JOB TRAINING. FOR YOUTH AND- SO. EVEN WHEN. WE TALK ABOUT THEM. WAY AMONG THE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE THAN FOR. DOLLARS AN HOUR. SO WHAT WHAT OR BE LIVING WAY APART OUR- HIS SAN FRANCISCO AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE AN HOUR OR FIVE TON SO OR- NO ES OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE NUMBER AS- DROP THE AND THE US THAT THE SAYS ELEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE PEOPLE ARE YOU FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE SOLD TO ELIMINATE THE ALL THESE NUMBERS AT THE ALMOST OF TRUMP THOUSAND PEOPLE. IS IT THE MORE FUNDING THE SOLUTION ON THE WALL WHAT IS DOES THE SOLUTION TO IT AN INMATE IS ALMOST TWO ZERO ZERO. I HIT I THINK THAT- SHE MADE AN EXCELLENT POINT AND THAT THE FUNDING WHAT'S SAN FRANCISCO HAS DONE HAS BEEN A NICE MODEL THAT OTHER COMMUNITY SHOULD LOOK AT YOU KNOW THEY'VE- INVESTED THEIR FUNDING AND SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE. AND THAT'S RESULTED IN MEASURABLE GOALS MEASURE MEASURABLE PROGRESS TOWARDS OVERCOMING THAT IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY WE HAVE MORE HOMELESS THIS YEAR WEEK EVERY YEAR HELP MORE EVERY. FUND FOR YOUTH THE TO ME AS A VERY HE WAS SPECIFICALLY. HOW CAN WE HELP- IS A HOUSING JOB TRAINING WILL FAMILY COUNSELING. I THINK I THINK HOUSING IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AND THE REASON I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NEED MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING THEY CAN'T GET THAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE A SECURE PLACE TO LIVE THE THEY CAN'T FIND A JOB THEY CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL THEY CAN'T DO ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE. SO IT REALLY IS BACK TO STARTING AT HOUSING. CAN WE TALK TO PARENTS OF FOR THEM TO- NOT TO COME OUT UNTIL. THEY STAND ON THEIR OWN FEET. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. I KNOW WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER MY PARENTS WHEN EXCITED ABOUT ME BEING THERE BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF DIFFICULT. HOME SO I COMPLY I HAVE SOME COMPASSION FOR THE PARENTS THESE KIDS ARE DIFFICULT SOMETIMES ALSO THEN THERE'S THE LIKE WHAT'S GOING TO TALKING ABOUT THERE WERE NO PARENTS THERE FOR HER AND MANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WHETHER IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HUMAN NAY BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO ADDS THING IF I CAN- BECAUSE I WAS ADOPTED AT AGE FOUR AND- IT. I IS IDEALLY WITH MY CASE MY PARENTS CHOSE TO BE MY PARENT AND THEN BAILED. AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS IT'S THEN KIND OF LEFT TO THE SYSTEM TO KIND OF FIX THOSE ISSUES VERSUS HOLDING RESPONSIBILITY ON THE YOUTH TO TRYING NAVIGATE AND FIX WHAT PROBLEM HAD GONE WRONG- AND FOR THE JOB SITUATION- FOR MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. THERE WAS NO I MEAN THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR I CAN REALLY HOLD A JOB AND I'M TWENTY TWO AND THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I STILL STRUGGLE EMOTIONALLY MENTALLY I MEAN IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT I WENT TO THE YEARS COUNT. TO GET RIGHT NOW. I'VE EVER FOR THE YOUTH EVEN BE THINKING ABOUT HAVE A JOB IN BEING SIX AT IT AND LIKE YOU HAD MENTIONED EARLIER WE DON'T KNOW A LOT OF US DEPENDING ON THE TRAUMA WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE REJECT WE THINK IT'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH US. I'VE BEEN TRYING MY WHOLE LIFE THAT PERRANCE. DOT THE PARENTS DIDN'T WANT ME FOUGHT DIDN'T WANT ME IT'S THIS LONG LINE OF WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME TO MAKE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE LEAVE. AND NOT HELP ME WITH THE SERVICES THAT I. SO IT'S- HOUSING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS BECAUSE OF THAT IS NOT STABLE. THEY CAN'T WORK ON ANYTHING THAT IS GOING WRONG- ONE- MY MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER AT MY CLINIC NOW HE HAD TALKED TO ME ABOUT- WHEN I FINALLY BECAME STABLE I STARTED REALIZING THAT A LOT OF MY MENTAL HEALTH STRUGGLES STARTED COMING UP AND I WAS. WHY LIKE I AM STABLE I AM DOING REAL. GOAL EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FINE.BUT WHEN YOU BECOME A STABLE YOU MAY HAVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SPEAKS TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS. AND THAT'S WHEN THEY COMING UP AND COMING OUT. NEW STAR. IN THERE THE- TO STOP. IF YOU WOULD THANK YOU FOR SHARING. THIS KADI YOU HAVE MAY. SO YOU MY IN. THE YOU KNOW CHOI THINK THAT YOUR CA AS OFTEN TO WE WANT TO FIND THE SOLUTION. YOU KNOW TELL ME THE MOST IMPORTANT DON'T TELL ME THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT CAUSES ARE YOU HOMELESSNESS AND IT WOULD E WONDERFUL IF WE COULD IDENTIFY WITH. BECAUSE THEN WE COULD ALL COME AROUND JUST THAT ONE ISSUE TAKE CARE OF IT AND THE WE RESOLVE THE ISSUE. AND I THINK- YOUR YOUR RESPONSES AND I THINK THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT WAS PROVIDED. MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT A ONE ISSUE. PROBLEM WHICH MAKES IT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT A ONE SOLUTION SOLUTION- SO I AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT MS REAGAN ABOUT HOW IT'S THE MONEY. I GOT TO TELL YOU THAT I THINK IN ADDITION TO THE MONEY IT'S ALSO HAVING THE RIGHT PEOPLE. IN THE PETITIONS THAT URINE- TO BE DEDICATED TO THIS I IN SAN BERNADINO I KNOW THAT REFORM P. HAVING STEVIE THAT THERE'S- IT. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS N OUR COMMUNITY. TO KNOW THAT IN SAN BERNADINO COUNTY JUST TEN YEARS AGO WE HAD NO PLACE FOR OUR YOUTH TO GO AND WE KNOW THAT A FOR YOUTH ARE HOMELESS YOU ARE TOLD WELL THE ONLY THING OF. ALL TO YOU IS THAT BAD NEXT TO THAT ADULT. THAT'S ONE OF THE WORST THINGS WE CAN DO TO OUR YOUTH AND YET THAT'S ALL WE COULD OFFER TO OUR YOUTH FOR YEARS. IT'S IT IS UNTIL FAMILY SERVICES COMES ALONG AND WHAT REGARD HERE FROM ANOTHER ONE OF THE SUCCESS STORIES OF. THAT MYSTERY MEN TOWARD BUT IT'S HAPPENING THIS COMMIT. TO I'M GOING MY LIFE BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE DONETHE TWO OF YOU AND OTHERS THAT WE HEAR FROM YOU HAVE DEDICATED YOUR LIFE TO STAYING THIS IS A PROBLEM AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT CONTINUE. CODY YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR STRENGTH YOUR COURAGE TO COME ERE JUST AS ARE MY CO CHAIR- CHU WAS THE- WAS SAYING.

SOMEONE WHO IS TELLING US MY PARENTS REJECTED ME THEM THAT MUCH MY ADOPTIVE PARENTS REJECT REJECTED ME THEN THE NEXT FOSTER PEOPLE JUST REJECTED ME. THINKING THAT THIS IS ALL YOU WHEN IT ISN'T ALL YOU BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS WE AS A SOCIETY HAVE FAILED YOU. AND WE FAILED SO MANY MORE OF OUR YOUTH. AND THAT'S WHY HAVING THIS HEARING IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE CAN'T CONTINUE JUST SAYING OKAY IT'S A PROBLEM BETTER RESULT IS A PROBLEM WITH BETTER RESOLVE IT. IT'S SAYING HOW DO WE SEE ALL THE- STE IMPORTANT. ARE IN IN THE DOCUMENT THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF OUR HOMELESS YOUTH. THEN NO WE HAVE CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AFTER THAT AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT GENERATIONAL. LIST SO HAVE TO THE CHAIN SOME POINT. YOUR STRENGTH CODY IN SAYING THIS IS FOR THE CHECK WAS BROKEN. IT'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF MY FAMILY AND HIS EXTENDED FAMILY AS ÞL THOSE KIDS THAT WERE FOSTER CARE WITH. LOS IT IS THE CHILDREN CHEST WILL HAVE TO HAVE IT IS YOUR YOUR YOUR MY PARENTS ARE BIOLOGICAL SAID IT'S ALL OF US BUT IT ISN'T JUST YOUR PROBLEM IT IS OUR PROBLEM AND I THANK YOU FOR BEING COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO COME AND TO SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE WAS SO THAT WE ALL CAN THEN BECOME BETTER POLICY MAKERS TO REALLY STUDY THE ISSUE.

HONESTLY I WOULD I WAS INVITED TO COME AND SPEAK TO THE FOSTER YOUTH ARE THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. HEARING FROM THEM ABOUT WHAT THE ISSUES WERE MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. ALL THE DIFFERENCE AND YOU ALLOWED SPACE FOR THEM TO SIT. ALL MAKE. MAKES A DIFFERENCE. IN THE- AND- ONE PHRASE THAT YOU USED WAS SCATTERED SITES MS REAGAN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. BETTER HOUSING SITES SO ROOMS AND ROOMS IN AND HALF THE HOUSES- APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE S. AROSE ANYWHERE WE CAN GET HIM ALL RIGHT. IT DIDN'T YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT I THINK THIS IS A RECURRING THEME WE NEED TO GET HOUSING AND THEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT- THAT AMONG SOME OF THE OTHER- THINGS THAT YOU DO YOU ALL HAVE TALKED ABOUT.

I'M HERE TODAY TO AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHAT THE STATE CAN DO YOU KNOW VERY FOCUSED ON THOSE SOLUTIONS- TO SUPPORT EXISTING PROGRAMS AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. ONE POPULATION THAT HAS CERTAINLY IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND THAT IS COME UP. IN THE PRIOR TESTIMONY IS THE ISSUE OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS SO MAKE KIND OF FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS FOCUSED ON THAT GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE. AND THEN TURNING MORE BROADLY TO THE LARGER POPULATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO MAY OR WHO MAY HAVE NOT BEEN IN FOSTER CARE. SOME OF RECOMMENDATION REALLY TO BUILD ON ONE OF. MOST SIX HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. IT'S GOT ANOTHER TOUGH ACRONYM- BUT IT'S CALLED THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PLACEMENT FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENCE. SO THIS UP FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT PROVIDES SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. TO OVER TWO THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE ANNUALLY. THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WHEN CALIFORNIA EXTENDED FOSTER CARE AT AGE TWENTY ONE. YOUNG ADULTS IN THIS SPECIFIC FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT TEACH PM D. AS WE CALL IT REALLY LIKE IT THEY LIKE THE COMBINATION OF THE INDEPENDENCE AND SUPPORT OF SERVICE IT PROVIDES. THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE SPECIFIC TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PLACEMENT HAS INCREASED EVERY YEAR SINCE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE WAS IMPLEMENTED- IT'S THE ONLY PLACEMENT THAT HAS THAT HAVE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AND DESPITE SLIGHT OVERALL DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG. AN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. I CALIFORNIA'S. CRISIS THREATENS EACH P. N. M. D. AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COUNT ON IT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE COST OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED 64% WHILE THE RATE THAT OUR STATE PAYS FOR THIS SPECIFIC FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT HAS INCREASED JUST 23% THIS HAS RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE WAIT LIST FOR TEACH P. AN EMPTY. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THESE ARE USED CURRENTLY IN FOSTER CARE WHO ARE ON A WAIT LIST FOR HOUSING. MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS WHILE THEY WAIT. EVERY NIGHT THEY WAIT THERE VULNERABLE PARTICULARLY CUSTODIAL PARENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY ACCESS THIS PROGRAM. ALSO THIS IS TRAGIC THE AGAIN THESE ARE STATES CURRENT FOSTER YOUTH THIS IS THE PROGRAM TO WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A- OF AN ENTITLEMENT AND WHICH THERE'S FEDERAL FUNDS FOR- SO TO ADDRESS THIS WE NEED THE STATE TO TAKE ACTION SPECIFICALLY TO STRENGTHEN ITS SUSTAIN TEACH P. AN EMPTY WE NEED TO CREATE WHEN YOU TRICKS. HOUSING WE AT THE AS IT IS AND THREE THE SUPPLEMENT THE CURRENT RATE. OF THIS SUPPLEMENT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN HIGH COST COUNTIES WHERE THE COST OF HOUSING FEED HOUSING PORTION OF EAST WHY TEACH P. N. EMPTY RATE. BY TO CALIFORNIA WOULD PROVE YOUTH FROM JOINING THE RANKS OF THE HOMELESS AND INSTEAD OFFER A PATH HIGHER EDUCATION AND AFTER ELITE ALL LET JEAN 83% FEDERAL. CITY TEACH AN EMPTY TWENTY MOMENT FURTHER UNDER OR THAT WAY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE IN FOSTER CARE IT IS A FEDERAL SHARE OF COST WE WANT TO MAKE OUR PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH EXTENDED CARE AS STRONG- AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THIS EIGHT ROLL PARTNERSHIP THEY WERE USING ONCE THEY FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE I'M- THE. THAT IS NO. CURE FOR OFTEN SO THIS IS. THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR YOUTH BUT FROM A POLICY POINT OF VIEW. IT'S YOU KNOW UTILIZING SO RE WHY. ALL MY SEC RECORD IS REFER CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS RESPONSE SYSTEM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF HOMELESS YOUTH. THE HOMELESS RESPONSE SYSTEM WAS CREATED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND IS FUNDED THROUGH THE MCKINNEY VENTO HOMELESS ASSISTANCE GRANTS. SO IN CALIFORNIA- THIS FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM PROVIDES FORTY FOUR CONTINUES OF CARE WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO PROVIDE SHELTER TRANSITIONAL HOUSING RAPID RE HOUSING MINUTE SUPPORT HOW. AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. UNFORTUNATE THE FEDERALLY FUNDED HOMES RESPONSE SYSTEM WAS NEVER DESIGNED WITH HOMELESS YOUTH IN MIND. THERE ARE NO PERMANENT SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR HOMELESS YOUTH THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH IT AND THE LOCAL PROCESS HUD REQUIRES TO DETERMINE WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR HOUSING KNOWN AS COORDINATED ENTRY PRIORITIZES CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS. SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS IN FACT HUD DID NOT EVEN REQUIRED CONTINUES OF CARE TO COUNT. THE NUMBER OF UNDER THE HOME TO THE ANY POINT IN TIME COUNT UNTIL THE FIFTEEN. NOW I'M NOT SO THAT TO BE YOU KNOW DOWN ARE NOT CONTINUE OF CARE OR ON THE HOMES RISK SYSTEM. IN FACT I'M A BIG FAN BUT WE DO NEED TO HAVE THE STATE REFORM THAT SYSTEM TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF HOMELESS YOUTH. WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS OUGHT TO LEVERAGE THE EXISTING HOMELESS RESPONSE SYSTEM TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF HOMELESS YOUTH. HUD HAS POURED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO CREATING THIS SYSTEM AND- SO RATHER THAN ABANDON IT AND TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH LETS YOU TO IT BUT LET'S MAKE SURE THAT HOMES. ARE PART OF IT IN A WAY THAT THEY NEVER HAPPENED- BUT CAN BE SO ONE SUCH POLICY THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THIS. IS A YOUTH SET ASIDE IN STATE FUNDING. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT FROM OTHER PEOPLE THIS APPROACH WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WITH THE CREATION OF THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM KNOWN AS HEAT. WHICH AS YOU'VE HEARD REQUIRED 5% OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AWARDED TO CONTINUOUS OF CARE AND LARGE CITIES TO BE SPENT ADDRESSING YOUTH. BOB KEEP FUNDING HAS BEEN AWARDED AND IN MAY IT LAST YEAR AND THEN MORE RECENTLY YESTERDAY. WE'VE OF- WRITTEN TO REPORTS ON HOW HE FUNDING WAS USED FOR- HOMELESS YOUTH. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD IDEA OF. HOW THAT FUNDING- HAS BEEN USED. AND WE FOUND THAT THE HOMELESS USE THAT ASIDE IS CHANGING PRACTICE LOCALLY NUMBER OF WAYS. THE FIRST WAY IS THAT THE HOME IT USED WITH YOU THAT ASIDE HAS DIRECTED OVER FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS ADDRESSING HOMELESS YOUTH. YOU HEARD ABOUT ONE X. IN SAM DO YOU KNOW COUNTY IN THE REPORT WE HAVE OVER FIFTEEN DIFFERENT EXAMPLES ABOUT HOW IT'S BEING USED. AND IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS THE LARGEST STATE INVESTMENT IN YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IN HISTORY CALIFORNIA. UP BACK IN MAY IT WAS ADJUSTED 10% NOW IT'S UP WOULD DOUBLE THE LEGAL MINIMUM REQUIRED BY LAW. WE WERE CURIOUS ABOUT THIS FINDING AND WE ASK THE CONTINUANCE OF CARE AND LARGE CITIES WHY THEY INVESTED MORE THAN DOUBLE THE LEVEL REQUIRED BY STATE LAW ON YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS TWO FOLD. FIRST THE LOCAL NEED IS OVERWHELMING AS YOU'VE HEARD THERE IS NO SECRET SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR HOMELESS YOUTH THE TOTAL STATE INVESTMENT PERMANENT ALLOCATION FOR YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. IS ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE CONTINUES A CARE TOLD AS WE USED IT BECAUSE THE NEED IS DESPERATE. AND SECOND THEY USED IT BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY ACTUALLY HAD A SOURCE OF FUNDING. SECOND THE HOME IF YOU SET ASIDE IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CONTINUUM OF CARE AND YOU PROVIDERS. IN THE PAST CONTINUES OF CARE DID NOT RECEIVE A SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT COULD ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. SO ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT COMES FROM HOT THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. NONE OF IT IS YOUTH FUNDING- AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL A PILOT PROGRAM THAT'S ONLY AVAILABLE IN THREE JURISDICTIONS BUT THE CORE PROGRAM PROGRAMMING FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING RAPIDLY HOUSING SHELTER. NONE OF THAT IS TARGETED TO YOUTH. AND LIKEWISE THERE WAS REALLY NO MOTIVATION FOR THE CONTINUUM OF CARE PROACTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH BUTTE PROVIDERS- WITH THE PROVIDERS ARE NOW AT THE TABLE AS WE'VE HEARD IN STATE BERNIE NO COUNTY AND OTHERS. FOR THE FIRST TIME. I AM FOR AND RECEIVING AND INTEGRATING THEIR SERVICES INTO THE HOME IS RESPONSE STEM. THIRD THE HOME. SIDE PROVIDED COMMUNITY THE OP. TO USE THE FUNDING TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS. IN SOME COMMUNITIES THAT NEED A SHELTER AS YOU HEARD 79% OF HOMES UNACCOMPANIED YOU THURMOND SHELTERED MANY COMMUNITIES AND HE'S CAN SEE FROM THE PORT REPORT THE MOST COMMON USE WHAT SHELTER. OTHER COMMUNITIES HAD SHELTER THEY CHOSE TO USE RIGHT USE IT FOR RAPID RE HOUSING OR ANOTHER HOUSING STRATEGY. AND AS WE KNOW A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH DOESN'T WORK FOR HOMELESS ADULTS AND IT DOESN'T WORK FOR HOMELESS YOUTH. BY MAKING STATE FUNDING AVAILABLE LOCALLY AND REQUIRED. REQUIRING IT TO BE SPENT ON YOUTH HOMELESSNESS COMMUNITIES WERE ABLE TO INVEST IN THE HOUSING SOLUTIONS THEY NEEDED AND BUILD OUT THEIR CONTINUUM OF HOUSING OPTIONS FOR HOMES YOU. THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THINGS CREATE A PROGRAM IN YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS WITH IT. INSTEAD THE MONEY DOWN LOCAL THE TO AN EXISTING SYSTEM AND THEN ALLOWED LOCALS TO. COMPLEMENT THEIR CURRENT- RESOURCES. SO THE SAID IT'S READY IS ONE A COLLECT OF PAULA THAT CAN STRENGTHEN IMPROVE OUR LOCAL HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM TO ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. OTHERS INCLUDING PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO YOU PROVIDERS TO ACCESS FUNDING. PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL CONTINUUM'S OF CARE TO IMPROVE THEIR POINT OF POINT IN TIME COUNTS FOR HOMELESS YOUTH. INCORPORATING YOUTH VOICE IN THE PLANNING AND DECISION MAKING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND ESTABLISHING ASSESSMENT AND PRIORITIZATION PROCESS FEATURES WITH IN LOCAL COORDINATED THREE SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT UNINTENTIONALLY SCREEN OUT YOUTH FROM HOUSING AND SERVICES. EACH OF THESE POLICIES TOGETHER WITH THE YOU SET ASIDE WILL RETOOL LOCAL HOMES RESPONSE SYSTEMS TO BE RELEVANT AND EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. IT IS IMPORTANT HOWEVER THAT WE KEEP THE PROGRESS GOING FORWARD IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BOTH OF THE STATE'S MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN HOMELESSNESS INCLUDED A YOU SET ASIDE. THE YOU DON'T AND THE CURRENT PROPOSALS THE CURRENT PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AT THIS JUNCTURE DOES NOT INCLUDE A STATE SET ASIDE. SO WE YOU KNOW WE DO NOT WANT TO MOVE BACKWARDS WE ARE KEEPING GETTING TO SEE SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN BEAR FRUIT- THEY'RE NOT PERFECT BUT IT IS ABOVE AND BEYOND ANY LEVEL. OF THE YOUTH ALMOST HOMELESSNESS EVER RECEIVED- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING TODAY'S HEARING. AND BY DOING SO YOU'RE BRINGING YOUTH HOMELESS THAT'S KIND OF OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE MAIN CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING ABOUT THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ONE ECHO THAT I'M I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE- FOR PERSONAL REASONS AND PROFESSIONAL REASONS- HI BLITZ IN CHICAGO FOR A LONG TIME BUT I GREW UP IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND I WORKED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN THE BAY AREA BACK IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AS WE WERE JUST TRYING TO PAY ATTENTION TO TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD FOR FOSTER YOUTH THAT- WE CELEBRATE EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAYS IT WAS A BITTERSWEET AFFAIR REALLY I PASSAGE AND MEETING THEIR CAUGHT AS A COUNTY WOULD TELL WOULD STOP FOR THIS PLACEMENT IN YOUR GROUP. ON A- DAY SO. BUSINESS LOT OF BACK THEN FOR LAST TO EIGHT YEAR I BEEN ACTED GAP AFTER GOING BACK SCHOOL AND HOMELESSNESS AMONG PEOPLE ASIA FOSTER'S ONE OF THINGS THAT I'VESTUDIED- MAIN REASON I'M HERE THOSE AND I'M ON THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR ON SOMETHING CALLED CAL YOUTH THE CALIFORNIA'S TRANSITIONS TO ADULTHOOD STUDY WHICH WAS CALLED FOR BY LEGISLATION THAT YOU PASSED- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA FOSTERING CONNECTIONS ACT A. B. TWELVE SAID. HE WOULD EVALUATION OF THIS- SO WE'RE DOING OUR VALUATION IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA CODE CHAU FOR CONGRESSMAN PARTNERSHIP SO- I'M GONNA SHARE JUST A FEW NUMBERS TO START WITH AND THEN MY IMPRESSIONS OF WHERE WE MIGHT GO FURTHER WITH EXTENT OF FOSTER CARE FOR FIVE SHE BUT ALSO LESS FOR THE BROADER POPULATION OF HOMES YOU. SO WE'VE BEEN SEVEN HAD TWENTY YOUNG WELL SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHEN THERE ARE SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD THEY WERE ALL IN YOUR SYSTEM REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE FROM THE WHOLE STATE RURAL URBAN CETERA. WE'VE INTERVIEWED THEM AT SEVENTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE JUST FINISHED AT TWENTY THREE WE FOLLOWED OVER 85% OF THEM FROM BASELINE. ALMOST ALL OF THE 95% AT SEVENTEEN. SO WHAT WE FOUND IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS- WE ALSO YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HOMELESSNESS AND COUCHSURFING EVERY TIME WE TALK TO THEM SINCE THE BASELINE. 31% OF THEM REPORT BEING HOMELESS SOME POINT BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY ONE. ANOTHER 18% CAP SEARCH SO THAT'S ABOUT HALF OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE NIGHT HOMES OR COUCH SURFING A DURING THAT FOUR YEAR PERIOD- ON AVERAGE THEY WERE HOMELESS FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS. BUT ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM HOMES FOR LESS THAN A WEEK SO THAT AVERAGE BE KIND OF MISLEADING YOU GOT FOLKS ARE HOMES FOR A LONG TIME. A LOT OF THEM IT'S FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. WHAT ARE SOME RISK FACTOR FOR HOME. AMONG YOU FLEE TO FOSTER. AND THIS IS GONNA ALL START TO SOUND VERY FAMILIAR HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT FOLKS BEEN SAYING THUS FAR. I GUESS I WOULD START WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA THAT'S THE BIGGEST RISK FACTOR FOR HOMELESSNESS IN THIS POPULATION IT'S A RISK FACTOR FOR HOMELESS AND ANY. POPULATION OF YOUNG ADULTS AND YOUTH- WE HAVE DATA ON LOTS OF THINGS THAT THE INCREASE THE RISK OF. OF YOUNG PEOPLE BECOME HOME. PLACEMENT INSTABILITY WHILE THEY'RE IN CARE BEHAVE BEHAVE AN EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS A HISTORY OF RUNNING AWAY WHILE THEY'RE IN CARE. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT FAMILY HISTORY OF CRIMINAL. JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT A FAMILY HISTORY OF HOMELESSNESS- MALES ARE ALSO GREAT RISK AND SEXUAL MINORITY YOUTH ARE BETTER RESPITE. I WOULD SAY TRAUMA JUST JUMPS OFF THE PAGE IN TERMS OF THOSE THINGS- AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH BRAIN SCIENCE. DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME. YOU HAVE A HARD TIME- AGING OR MOTIONS. AND STRESSFUL SITUATION. YOU'LL HAVE. YOU'RE GONNA GONNA MAKE TO SAY. THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC AND- AN INFECTION PLUMMETED EDUCATION AND HOUSING. CHECK FACTORS TO THINGS JOHN ABOUT WHY. ADULT SUPPORT. MULTIPLE ADULTS NOT. ON THE- YEAH YEAH I WANT. TO LIVE. GOOD ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT REALLY TRUE FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE 90% AND WILL TELL YOU THAT. AN ADULT. I THEY NEED MORE THAN. ALLOWING ON PEOPLE REMAINING CARE. SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE RISK OF HOMELESSNESS AND- I WAS ON THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE AND HOMELESSNESS RESEARCH COUNCIL FOR NUMBER YEARS EVERYBODY AROUND WOULD TELL YOU. IF YOU SUBSIDIZE PEOPLE'S HOUSING TO PROVIDE THEM HOUSING THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO BE HOMELESS. AND ESSENTIALLY THAT IF EXTENDED CARE DOES NOTHING ELSE. IT SAYS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE THE SAN PEOPLE WITH YOU KNOW THREE HOTS AND A COT BASICALLY A PLACE TO LIVE IN THEIR BASIC NEEDS. AND SO CLEARLY DOES THAT IN MANY CASES SO WHAT'S IN THAT AFFECTED THAT I JUST GAVE YOU THE BAD NEWS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF BECOME HOMELESS. BUT OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS THAT EVERY ADDITIONAL YEAR. MEDICARE SPENDING TIME CARE REDUCE THE RISK OF HOMELESSNESS BETWEEN SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE BY ABOUT ONE THIRD. THIS IS HALF THE SHOP PEOPLE SEVENTEEN ARE IN CARE OF THE TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY. I MEANS OF FOR THOSE OF YOUNG WILL YOU. RISK OF ALMOST BY TWO THIRDS. BY BIKES THAT TOOK CARE. SECOND FOUND IS THIS RELATES THAT OVER THE SUPPORT. WE HAVE SHOWN PEOPLE YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE YOU CAN. ON FOR TANGIBLE SUPPORT. SOME RELIABLE MONEY PLACE TO CRASH GET YOU SOMEWHERE IF YOU NEED TO GET THERE. THOSE WHO SAID THEY HAD ENOUGH PEOPLE WERE 44% LESS LIKELY TO BE HOMELESS IN THE YOUNG PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD NO ONE. WERE NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE. SO WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT BOLSTERING THE SIX CENTER FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OF THIS GOING TO SOUND REALLY FAMILIAR SO. THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS MAYBE A NEW THING AND THAT IS YOU FOLKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE WHAT I CALL WHEN I GO OUT AND TALK WHEN THE COUNTRY ABOUT MY STUDY. THE MOST INCLUSIVE- PROGRAM THAT CENTER FOSTER CARE IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S ESSENTIALLY A RIGHTS BENEFITS PROGRAM- AND I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HELP. IN ORDER IS BECAUSE I'M A PARENT OF TWO YOUNG ADULT THE DAUGHTERS AND- THEY RELY ON ME FOR SPORT ALL TIME I GET TEXT EARLIER TODAY MY TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD WITH A CONCRETE QUESTION BY EITHER. GET THROUGH A PROBLEM. BUT YOU GOT A LOT OF VARIATION BETWEEN YOUR COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HOW THAT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED. AND THE RATE AT WHICH ON PEOPLE REMAINING CARE TO TWENTY ONE VERY IS QUITE A BIT BETWEEN COUNTIES IN THE STATE IN OUR DATA SUGGESTS THAT'S NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR INCLINATIONS ARE THE HOUSE MARK EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. SINCE SOME COUNTIES ARE BEING MORE INCLUSIVE AND WELCOMING WITH THEIR EXTENDED CARE POLICY THAN OTHERS- BY DIDN'T REALLY SAY MUCH ABOUT WHY THAT'S THE CASE ON WHAT WAY THAT WORKS BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD PAY ATTENTION TO. THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY AND THIS IS GONNA SOUND FAMILIAR. IS WE REALLY NEED TO RETHINK CASE MANAGEMENT IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FOR TRANSITION AGES. THE MODEL A CASE MANAGEMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS YOU NEED TO PUT. HAVE AN AGENT OF THE STATE OR THE COUNTY HERE. PUT THEIR EYES ON THE CHILDCARE ONCE A MONTH. THAT'S BASED ON LITTLE KIDS IN CARE. ALL THOSE LITTLE KIDS IN HER ALL MINORS IN CARE. BUT HE'S REVISING THE CARE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THEY CAN RELY ON IN THE CASE WORKER GONE VISIT LOOK. TALK TWO THIRDS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF. CARE AND SO SEARCHING PIECE. RIGHT A CASE. WHO SOME WANTS SOME. IS NOT IN A POSITION TO ENGAGE AND TRAUMA INFORMED WAY WITH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO ACCESS ALL THESE ADULTS SERVICE SYSTEMS. YOUNG PEOPLE GO TO- CHANGE BE PROGRAMS. HOPEFULLY THOSE PROGRAMS ARE DOING THAT. BUT A LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE INSULTS. AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE LEVEL OF INTERVENTION WE NEED TO COMMONSENSE SUGGESTS THAT MODEL CASE MANAGEMENT. IS NOT ADEQUATE. EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN EVALUATING TO PROGRAMS ONCE CALLED LIVE SET. AND OTHERS CALL THE MASSACHUSETTS ADOLESCENT OUT REACH PROGRAM THOSE WERE INTENSIVE. CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. WHY SET THEY TRAIN OF THOSE WORKERS AND TRAUMA FOCUSED AB T. MOTIVATIONAL EVERY AND A VARIETY OF EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS THAT WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. AND THAT PROGRAM SHOWED A REDUCTION HOMELESSNESS BETTER MENTAL HEALTH- MATCHES ADOLESCENCE BROKE OUT REACH PROGRAM AGAIN INTENSIVE LOWER CASE LETTERS ANSWER QUESTION LOWER CASE LOADS OF THESE AROUND EIGHT TO TEN. SICK INCREASE COLLAGEN. PERSISTENCE SO I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND THEIR STRUCTURAL ISSUES IN YOUR TROUBLE FOR SYSTEM I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR COUNTIES TO DO THAT EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO DO IT LASTLY. AT JUST A ON THIS POINT- IF I'M A CASE WORKER AND I HAVE A YOUNG PERSON WHO NEEDS MORE HELP THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH THEY GET FOR SELF MIGHT GET THEM A PLACE TO STAY AND THEY'RE GOING TO COLLEGE. BUT I THINK THEY NEED MORE HELP ALL I HAVE IS T. H. P. AND MD. I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER TOOLS RIGHT. SO I THINK THINKING ABOUT THAT STRUCTURAL ISSUE- IS SOMETHING WORTH DOING FOR AND THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IS IN A IN A POSITION TO THAT WERE AS THE COUNTIES ARE NOT. AND THEN LASTLY I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF THIS DEVELOPING BETTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN COUNTY TROUBLE FOR AGENCIES AND ALL THESE ADULTS SERVING SYSTEMS. TO WORK WITH THEIR SYSTEMS AS PART OF A SOLUTION AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET DOT STRIP DISMISS TO BE SENSITIVE TO TRACK. MOST SYSTEM. ARE SET UP THE TRANSITION EACH YEAR. RIGHT FITS PARA PROGRAMS. FOR NOT SET UP FOR. HAVING A KID AND- THEIR AVERAGE PER IS OLDER NAPA COUPLE KIDS. MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IT WAS SERVICE MENTAL ILLNESS IN THEIR FORTIES OR FIFTIES. YOUR HER EXAMPLE THAT I MEAN PUT IN A BAD NEXUS ADULTHOOD GOT SERIOUS PROBLEMS. SO WORKING USING YOUR CHILD WELFARE AGENCY WHO HAS THE ENTITLEMENT AS AS AMY SAYS. TO TRY TO GET THOSE SYSTEMS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WORK TOGETHER I THINK WOULD BE A REAL IMPROVEMENT IN SYSTEM. THE FAX. SEC THANK YOU LEVI DEATH. I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM IT'S ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO IT TOO TO HEAR YOU SPEAK ABOUT YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE DONE NOW TO TRANSITION INTO USING THOSE EXPERIENCES TO NOW HELP YOU WELL THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY KIND- I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE LEFT ALREADY FR LEAVING BEFORE I SPEAK- THAT DEFINITELY MAKES THIS MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE SO YOU CAN EXTEND MY THANKS TO THEM- I'M LEAVE I'D DEATH RATE WITH THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM I'M ALSO THE YOUTH ADVISORY. CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CODE IN FOR YOUTH- LISTENING TO THIS HEARING TODAY WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF ABSTRACTS AND A LOT OF REALLY FIRM SOLID IDEAS ALSO ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO FIGHT HOMELESSNESS AND HOW TO COMBAT YOUTH HOMELESSNESS XP SPECIFICALLY I'M AND I LIKE YOU MISTER CHOI M. A VERY INTERESTED IN CONCRETE- ANSWERS AND HOW WE SOLVE THESE THINGS SO I WILL GET TO SOME- IN MY HUMBLE OPINION WHICH PROBABLY AND WITH MUCH BUT I APPRECIATE THAT- TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE I CAME FROM INITIALLY. I AM FROM SAN MEDINA COUNTY BORN AND RAISEDON THE WEST SIDE OF SAME TO DO YOU KNOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW SEVENTEEN WAS RECENTLY NAMED THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA NOT EXACTLY A PLACE THAT- PROMOTES THE DEVELOPMENT AND POSITIVE GROWTH OF YOUNG PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY YOUNG MEN OF COLOR WHICH IS A DEMOGRAPHIC I FIT ITO- WHEN I BECAME HOMELESSNESS YOU ASKED A BIT BRIEFLY EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE CAUSES AND SOME OF THE REASONS- I CAME HOME IS AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN BECAUSE MY FATHER. WAS A PIECE OF POLICY TO OFF AND MOTHER WE EASY MY NEED TO MY NAY BUT THE TIME SO THE COULD NOT AFFORD AMONG IT'S ALSO ADDED. NO MA'AM TOLD ME CENTER. WITH BEFORE TAKING. I NEED FIGURE SOME THINGS OUT. ON SO THAT POINT I'D BE HOMELESS. I WAS HONEST SLEEPING PARK. OR COUCH SURF YOU KNOW YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE- OR FOR. YOU MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GET A SYMPATHETIC PARENT WHO'S WILLING TO LET YOU CRASH ON THE COUCH FOR A FEW DAYS BUT EVEN THAT. IS REALLY ONLY TEMPORARY- AFTER THAT I ENDED UP- BEING PUT INTO A NOT PUT INTO PLACING MYSELF INTO OUR YOUTH SHELTER WHICH IS CALLED OUR HOUSE WHICH IS RUN. BY FAMILY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IT'S A RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTER SPECIFICALLY FOR AGES ELEVEN TO SEVENTEEN- THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN SANFORD AND YOU KNOW COUNTY. AND THE REASON WHY SPECIFIED THAT'S THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IS BECAUSE I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO KNOW SOMEBODY WHO WORKED AT THIS FACILITY. HAD I NOT KNOWN THAT PERSON THERE IS VERY LOW LIKELIHOOD I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THESE RESOURCES OR EVEN GET MYSELF. INTO THESE SERVICES ON MY OWN I WAS PRETTY CONFIDENT AT SIXTEEN- AS I AM NOW I DON'T SEE MYSELF BEING CONFIDENT ENOUGH. TO WALK INTO MY COUNSELOR'S OFFICE AT SCHOOL AND SAYING HEY I'M HOMELESS I NEED YOU TO HELP ME I DON'T IMAGINE THAT FOR MOST YOUNG PEOPLE EXPECT ESPECIALLY NOT MYSELF- AT THAT POINT. I WENT THROUGH OUR HOMES YOU SHELTER PROGRAM. AND I GOT A I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH. I'VE LOOKED LIKE THIS SINCE I WAS FIFTEEN I GOT A JOB IN CONSTRUCTION. AND I ENDED UP BECOMING NOT RIGHT AT FIRST WE KNOW CONSTRUCTION TO BE SOMETIMES BUT I DID BECOME A TAXPAYER- AND NOW I CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE SAME RESOURCES THAT HELP ME THE REASON WHY I'M DOING. TODAY IS BECAUSE ALL THOSE THINGS SAID. I A I'M HERE AND I FIGHT FOR THE HOME YOU WERE VERY LIKE ME. BILL LEAVE MY OF TO BE PARTICULAR I DON'T WOULD BE PER. BY OR TAKE GIFT ANYWAY. BUT I WE- HAVE BEEN OP. MY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO. AND I. BELIEVE THAT. MAIN PETER AS TO I. FOR THEN SO MY PEERS BECAUSE DIVING WHEN I. WHICH ALLOW YOU TO BE SO. I'M ABOUT THIS. HOME TO PREVENT THE CARD HOMELESSNESS I ABSOLUTE HEARING TO BE FAT GENERAL HOME REAL MY DIED TWO YEARS AGO OF AS A HOMELESS DRUNK MY FATHER AWAY ALCOHOLIC AND BEING YET. MY FATHER FOR TO DEATH BECAUSE DIDN'T HAVE A BLANK HE SLIPPED OUTSIDE NOW WAS ONLY TWO YEARS AGO AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT MY PATH SHOULD HAVE BEEN I HAVE THREE OLDER SIBLINGS TWO OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED MY OTHER OLDER SIBLING IS CURRENTLY HOMELESS HEROIN ADDICT IN THE CITY OF SAN BERNADINO MY MOTHER- FOR ALL OF HER ATTEMPTS AT SOBRIETY IS SILL VERY MUCH SO STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IF THESE PROGRAMS WORK IF THESE INTERVENTION MATT. FRUIT TO THEM THE ANSWER IS AB. YES BECAUSE IF IT WERE NOT FOR THESE PROGRAMS I WOULD BE EXPONENTIALLY MORE LIKELY TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE PEOPLE WHO I WAS GROWN UP WHO WAS RAISED AROUND. AND IN ALL HONESTY- IN MY OWN HUMBLE OPINION BEING HOMELESS SAVED ME. FROM A LOT OF THE FAMILY STUFF THAT I WAS BEING EXPOSED TO AND ALTHOUGH BEING HOMELESS WAS HOMELESS WAS DIFFICULT I WAS ABLE TO FIND SUPPORT THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND RESOURCES. THROUGH AN AGENCY- IN FAMILY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHO IS A RECIPIENT OF THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE HOPING TO TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY. STE EXCUSE ME SO AS A REAL TANGIBLE OUTCOME IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENDING HOMELESSNESS. AND THAT'S REALLY OUR GOAL WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SOME REAL SOLID OUTCOMES AND- TO GO TO YOUR POINT- IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE TO ANY OF US THAT CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS IS AS RAMPANT OF A PROBLEM AS IT IS. WHEN THERE HAS BEEN FOR FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THERE WAS NO NEW FUNDING INTRODUCED TO YOU HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION THERE WAS NO NEW FUNDING GIVEN. YOUTH HOMELESSNESS OVER THIRTY YEAR PERIOD SO OVER THIRTY YEARS PEOPLE WHO ARE TWENTY THEN BECOME FIFTY. EL ALL YOUR LOOKING AT A MESSAGE MEDICALLY WHISPER. WHEN REALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE STATE. AS A WHOLE HAS DECIDED FOR THIRTY YEARS TO INSTEAD OF PUTTING MONEY TOWARDS OIL CHANGES AND TUNE UPS. THE STATE IS DECIDED TO HOLD THAT MONEY AND HOLD ONTO IT FOR THIRTY YEARS AND THEN TRY TO THROW LUMP SUMS OF CASH AT BUYING A LOT OF NEW CARS THIRTY YEARS LATER. WHEN IF WE WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN USING INCREMENTAL FUNDING TO PREVENT IT FROM BECOMING SUCH A MASSIVE ISSUE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. NOW THAT PRESENTS AS WITH THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY FRAME HOW WE WANT. THIRTY YEARS LOOK AS LOOK TO FUTURE AND AS MUCH ENEMY GROW. WHAT YOU WANT LOOK LIKE. AT I THINK WE ALL AS FULL OF EITHER WHAT THE LESS HOW THIS THIRD YEARS THE REST DAY. AND A TRUE. THANK TRUE. WAY SEVEN ONE THAT CAN BE. IN A TRUE WAY TO ENSURE. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK OR- HOMELESS ARE A TO RE. SERVE THAT PREVENT THEM FROM BECOMING BECOMING YOUR CHRONICALLY. OF BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ADULT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE SIDE EFFECTS AND THEN THE SYMPTOMS OF THAT OUR COMMUNITY. THEY ARE BAD FOR PROPERTY VALUES CRIME RATES GO UP- THERE'S A LOT OF THE CLEANLINESS ISSUES THESE ARE ALL THINGS WERE WELL AWARE OF. SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO SOLVE THAT INSTEAD OF PICKING AT THE WEEDS OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS OR PICKING AT THE WEEDS OF MENTAL HEALTH- PICKING AT THE WEEDS OF VETERANS. SERVICES THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT BUT THE REAL ROOT CAUSE OF IT THE REAL WAY TO GET THOSE WEEDS OUT OF THE GARDEN. IS TO FOCUS ON KEEPING MORE PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE BEGINNING WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE THIS FUNDING IS SO ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU ALL OF ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YES MR STONE ARE YOU SEE MISTER DEATH HER AGE. YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. BUT HOW NAIVE BECAUSE WE SPEND MONEY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM NOW EVEN THOSE CREATED THIRTY YEARS AGO AND WE'RE NOTLOOKING THIRTY YEARS AHEAD THAT'S THE WAY GOVERNMENT WORKS. THAT'S YOUR FRUSTRATION AND I SHARE THAT SO ALL OF THE TALK AND THE MONEY IN THE PROGRAM THAT THAT WERE. LOOKING AT NOW VERY LITTLE OF THAT IS TO PREVENTION AND IF WE CUT A ROLL THIS BACK AND- LOOK AT. THE AND PROFESSORS. TRAUMA YOUR THESE INDICATORS WE KNOW KIDS COMING IN THE SYSTEM HAVE TRAUMA WE KNOW KIDS WHETHER THEY'RE JUSTICE INVOLVED CHILD WELFARE INVOLVES ANY OF THESE ARE THE HOMELESS INVOLVES. COME WITH TRAUMA AND YET WE SEEM ON WILLING. TO DEAL WITH THAT AND SO THESE KIDS ARE CARRYING THESE CHALLENGES ALL THE WAY THROUGH SO I APPRECIATE YOUR IT ANALOGY ABOUT THE- CARD. ADDING OIL INTO A WEEK BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T IN AND WE TYPICALLY DON'T. WANT TO ADDRESS- WERE HAVE BERRY SEE TO TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT YOUTH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESS. BUT PREVENTING YOUTH HOMELESSNESS NOW YOUR RATE IS SAVING FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS IN FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S THIS EXACT CONVERSATION ABOUT DEALING WITH WHATEVER CRISIS THEY HAVE. DOWN THE LINE. AND PROFESSOR COURTNEY AS YOU TALK ABOUT THE A. B. TWELVE OF BERMAN TATIAN WHICH JUST STRIKES ME IS PRETTY CLEAR WE HAVEN'T COMPLETELY FUNDED. ALL OF WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY NEEDS TO BE. SO AGAIN IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT REDUCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE FUTURE AND SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES THAT THESE KIDS GO THROUGH WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY FUND THAT PROGRAM. NOW SO THAT KIDS WHO ARE AGING OUT OR I THINK ANYONE WHO WOULD TOUCH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AT SOME POINT IN THEIR YOUNG LIFE BECAUSE THEY STILL COME WITH THOSE SAME DRAMAS AND THEY STILL COME WITH THE SAME CHALLENGES NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS WHICH SHOULD ALSO IN MY VIEW. GO UNTIL TWENTY FIVE NOT JUST TWENTY ONE WHICH IS MORE MONEY BUT WHAT HAD COULD INVESTMENT THAT WOULD BE. IN STRENGTHENING OUR KIDS SO WE TEND TO STEP TO THINK ABOUT HOMELESS YOUTH OR CHILD WELFARE INVOLVED YOU THROUGH OUR PROBATION YOUTH AS IF THERE AND WE TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY AS IF THEY'RE DIFFERENT KITS BUT BUT THEY'RE NOT. THEY COME FROM THE SAME PROMISE THE SAME FAMILY ISSUES AND HOW DO WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR CHILD WITHOUT. ADDRESSING THE FAMILY. IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT THEM BACK INTO THAT FAMILY IF WE'RE IF WE HAVE ANY NOTION OF IT. SO THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN INTERESTING ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION TODAY IS I THINK IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND THE ISSUES THAT THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T OPENLY ADDRESS. BUT WHAT WOULD A BETTER SYSTEM LOOK LIKE A ME WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO AND EVEN SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE KIND OF PIECING SOME THINGS TOGETHER SHOULD WE HAVE AN AGENCY OR- THE ABILITY TO LOOK. AT KIDS. WHATEVER THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE. AND PROVIDE SIMILAR LEVELS OF SERVICES ANY MISS DEATH OR YOU TALK ABOUT SO HOMELESS YOUTH SO IT IN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT DEAL WITH. HOW MUCH USE IN AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THERE ARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR SOME BUT NOT FOR OTHERS. AND YET THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME. SITUATION SHOULD BE IN THE SAME PROGRAMS. WOULD WE BETTER BE BETTER OFF HAVING A COMMON SET OF SERVICES. FOR KIDS REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY ENTER THAT SYSTEM. BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM HOW THEY COME. AND NOT THINK OF THEM AS JUSTICE INVOLVED NOT THINK OF THEM AS DEPENDENCY COULD NOT THINK OF THEM AS HOMELESS. YOUTH THESE ARE ALL. KIDS WHO ARE STRUGGLING. AND WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HELP THEM IT ISN'T THAT ULTIMATELY THE STEP WE NEED TO BE TAKING. I THINK SO I THINK I THINK SO ACTUALLY I HATE TO COVER THE LOOK THE LANGUAGE BUT WE I WAS ON NATIONAL ACADEMIES PANEL AROUND THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF YOUNG ADULTS AND THEN I WAS KINDA. SERGEANTS AFTER THE SYSTEM INVOLVED. AND I GOT THE GROUP THEIR TALK WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLES' MARGINALIZED IT WASN'T LIKE RISK VULNERABLE IT'S LIKE HEY THEY'VE BEEN MARGINALIZED LAST BRING THE MEN. AND I THINK IF YOU DO THAT. YOU KNOW THE DETAILS OF THAT I THINK WILL PROBABLY BE ON THIS CONVERSATION BUT IF YOU IF YOU. YOU KNOW THINK IT THAT WAY ABOUT THEN. THESE JOSH I THINK OR ENCOURAGE IF NOT FORCED TO. WORK TOGETHER BETTER THAN THEY DO RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF GATE KEEPING HERE THAT GOES ON WHEN YOU HAVE. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH NO RESOURCES IT'S JUST RATIONAL BEHAVIOR FOR PEOPLE SAY WELL THAT'S NOT OUR PRO THAT'S NOT. HE'S NOT ONE OF US IN OUR SHE'S NOT ONE OF US. SO I THINK PHILOSOPHICALLY TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AND THEN YOU FIGURE OUT. HOW TO USE YOUR YOUR YOUR PROBATION SISTER TROUBLE FOR SYSTEM THE RUNAWAY HOMELESS YOUTH ACT MONEY YOUR FAMILY ASSISTANCE RESOURCES. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY. IT'S SET UP RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S NO ARE FROM IT. BUT WOULD THAT BE MORE EFFICIENT. WELL I TESTED TALK TO HIS POINT AS SO WITH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUTH VOICE IN AND PRACTICES TO IMPROVE THIS GOING FORWARD. I AM THE CHAIR OF OUR YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD DOWN THEM AND YOU KNOW COUNTY. AND THEIR MEMBERS OF MY YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD TO EVER BE HOMELESS. REMEMBER WE HOPE. THERE ARE PEOPLE. GO TO CALL. IN THEIR- WORK ON JOB SITES CONSTRUCTION SO. I THINK WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE SET OF REESE. FOR ALL YOU WHETHER THEY BE SYSTEM INVOLVED A REGARD I UNDER. THE BEHIND THAT BECAUSE- LOOK I'M NOT GONNA TELL SOMEBODY THEY CAN'T HAVE A GOOD IDEA ABOUT YOU HOMELESSNESS JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE HOMELESS THAT WOULD BE NOT THAT WOULD BE. NAIVE OF ME. BUT I THINK THAT- AS FAR AS MOVING THIS FORWARD WAYS TO IMPROVE IT I THINK HAVING YOUTH VOICE IN GENERAL IS ESSENTIAL. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A PIECE THAT IS OFTEN- WHETHER IT BE UTILIZED I THINK IT'S UNDER UTILIZED THERE ARE A LOT. AND I WON'T NAME NAMES BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF NON PROFITS AND A LOT OF. AGENCIES IN GENERAL THAT HAVE A YOUTH VOICE AND IT'S ONE YOUTH PERSON. WHO NEVER REALLY GETS ANY SUPPORT FROM THAT H. T. BUT THEY SAY THEY HAVE A YOUTH VOICE AND THAT IS COMMON PRACTICE. AND I THINK INTEL WE START- CHANGING SOME SOME GUIDELINES AND SOME DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT IT YOUTH VOICE. AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING WE REALLY SHOULD DISCUSS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE- IF AND HOPELESSNESS IS OUR GOAL WILL BE HERE UNTIL I DIE. AND THE LONG TIME AWAY SO I THINK WE NEED TO START DOING IS ALLEGING THAT THESE. WHILE IT IS AN OVER ARCHING ISSUE THERE'S A LOT OF. MISSIONS UMBRELLA OF BUSINESS. YOU WANT TO OUR TARGET. THAT'S REALLY AFFECT A VILLA AT THE END THE ROAD. MORE THAN IF YOU DAM IT UP THREE VILLAGES AHEAD OF THAT. YOU NEVER HAVE THE FLOOD DOWN THERE SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY SHOULD THAT'S THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS IS. YOU YOU HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL IS AN ISSUE BUT- IF YOU REALLY IF WE REALLY AGREE AND WE'RE HONEST THAT WE WANNA FIGHT AGAINST. HOMELESSNESS CONTINUING TO GROW BECAUSE IT IS GROWING. AND LIKE THE 3% DECREASE. OF HOMELESS YOUTH THIS IS A NUMBER THAT I HEAR A LOT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS KNOW THIS OR NOT. BUT THE PEOPLE PUT MINISTER THAT COUNT IN A LOT OF AREAS HAVE HEAVY. IT HAS EVERY INCENTIVE. KEEP THAT NUMBER LOW. ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO THINK THAT YOU OF ABOUT HOMELESS YOUNG PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I WOULD BE COST ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS NO THE BEST. WE PUT ON END THAT A LET. BECAUSE I'M OF A MUCH LARGER AMALGAMATION OF AN ISSUE. THAT WE WILL NEVER GET A TRUE NUMBER ON. IT AND I AM SORRY IF WERE. PATTING OURSELVES ON THE BACK FOR A 3% REDUCTION IN HOMELESS. WHEATLEY MISSING. THE POINT YES. AND THERE IS A PROPOSAL FOR A YOUTH COUNCIL. WHICH I THINK WOULD BE FABULOUS YES I- THREE OF US IT'S A YEAH AND THIS IS TO YOUR POINT ABOUT GETTING KIDS VOICES WHEN WE- LOOKED AT IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOME CHALLENGES WE ARE HAPPY. TO OFFER. THEM WE DO THE SAME THING WHICH- SOME FOR FOSTER. WITH AND IT WAS. CLEAR AND- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME LEVEL THEY THEY WERE INTIMATE IF. THEY WEREN'T SURE HOW THEY FELT THERE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GET THEIR VOICE. WE LET THEM CREATE THE VENUE WE LET THEM AND THEN WE HAD TREMENDOUS ABOUT OF. APPROPRIATE INPUT. INTO DECISIONS THAT WE'RE MAKING AND SO IT'S LESS ABOUT ADULTS BEING VERY PATERNAL TELLING WE KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU. WHEN WE DON'T IT'S LEADING. THE YOU HAVE A VOICE. IN THAT AND I THINK THE YOUTH THE YOUTH THAT I'VE DEALT WITH WHETHER. HOMELESS OR JUSTICE INVOLVED OR CHILD WELFARE INVOLVES OR ANY OF THAT. THEY DON'T LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN THOSE CATEGORIES WE CREATE THOSE CATEGORIES AND I THINK WE MISSED THE POINT. BY DOING THAT AND WE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY SERVE. YOUTH IN A IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY SO I'M HOPING WE CAN. DO SOME KIND OF A SEA CHANGE. WHAT THE ONE PET PHRASE I'VE HEARD HOUSTON IT RESONATES WITH ME IS THE HIGH STAKES ELIGIBILITY. SO LIKE IN FOSTER CARE IF YOU ARE REUNITED YOU KNOW BEFORE AGE SIXTEEN OR IF YOU ARE EXITS PERMANENCE BEFORE AGE EIGHTEEN OR IF YOU ARE UNIFIED BEFORE EACH THIRTEEN THERE'S THESE MOMENTS THAT PUT YOU DIFFERENT CATEGORIES- BUT TO YOUR POINT TO THEY HAVE. THE TUBE TO CHANGE TO GET RID OF TYSON SOLDIER BUT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW- THAT ELIGIBILITY IS WHAT DRIVES ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES VERSUS RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE AND MINIMIZE THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE YOUNG PERSON. STE VERSES AND I KNOW FOR PRACTICE. IN THAT'S HI BUT IT'S GOTTEN TO AN EXTENT NOW WE WORK LAST YEAR ON A BILL FOR YOU TO TEACH PEOPLE US A HOUSING PROGRAM FOR FORMER FOSTER IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE IF YOU'RE IN CARE ON YOUR EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY WE TRIED TO GET DOWN BEST TO SIT TEAM TO SAY YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE IN CARE WHEN YOU'RE SIXTEEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF RISK THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS PROGRAM. AND IT WAS JUST. IT WAS. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE LET'S JUST THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE WERE. CRACKING OPEN THE DOOR AND TRY TO PUSH PEOPLE THROUGH- AND SO I JUST WANT A WHOLE HEARTEDLY ENDORSED THE- MOVING AWAY FROM THIS VERY HIGH STAKES ELIGIBILITY ORIENTATION. WE ARE VERY FAR AWAY FROM THAT BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY THAT IS A WAY OF RATIONING. OF SCARCE RESOURCES IT IT. YEAH BUT TO MISTER DEATH RIDGES POINT EARLIER LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE PUT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WHAT WE'RE TALK ABOUT NEXT YEAR WE PUT IN LAST YEAR BUDGET. FOR HOMELESSNESS YEAH. WE COULD BE INVESTING THAT NOW IN YOUTH BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A SMALL PART OF ALL OF THIS GRAND OTHERWISE INVESTMENT IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE SCHEME OF THINGS BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT ITS ONGOING MONEY. HOW BETTER COULD WE INVEST IN OUR FUTURE SYSTEMS IN EVEN IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS. BEEN BEEN DEALING WITH THE SITUATIONS CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN AND HELPING THEM OUT THERE SO THEY DON'T BECOME PERMANENTLY HOMELESS OF THE DON'T BECOME. SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY BE PARTICIPATE IN OUR SYSTEMS RATHER THAN BE SHUNTED ASIDE AS THEY- AS THEY OFTEN ARE SO I DON'T. BY THAT I THINK THAT'S- FOOLISH AND WE END UP AND THROWING A LOT OF GOOD MONEY. CHASING SOLUTION OR DIFFICULT JUST TO GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS WHEN WE HAVE I THINK HONESTLY A WAY OF DEALING WITH. WITH YOUTH NOW IN A MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE WAY AND THAT'S AND INVESTMENT WE COULD BE MAKING A LONG TERM IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND REDUCE ME THINK ABOUT REDUCING THE JUSTICE COSTS AND REDUCING THE TAP WATER GLASS AND PUTTING THOSE SYSTEMS OUT OF BUSINESS WHICH WE WON'T FOR LOTS OF REASONS BUT SEVERELY MINIMIZING WE MINIMIZE THE LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS OF THE SYSTEMS BY THOSE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS BUT WE GET THERE WILL BY UPS BIGELOW THESE WERE THAT. WE DON'T THAT WAY YOU THROW A LOT OF MONEY PROBLEM THAT'S FOR US BECAUSE IT'S POLITICALLY X. BUT UNWILLING TO LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING CAUSES WERE LOOK TEN YEARS DOWN THE LINE TO SAY WHERE ARE WE GOING TO BE. YEAH WE GOT IT IS A MUCH MORE RATIONAL IF YOU GIVE US IF YOU GET YOUNG PEOPLE AND I SAYS I'M ON ONE OF THEM TWENTY TWO SO I STILL COUNT FOR COUPLE YEARS AND HOLD ON TO THAT- BUT- IF YOU GET. SOME PEOPLE IN. DOLLARS YEAR FOR NEXT TEN YEARS I GUARANTEE YOU THE OUTCOMES WILL BE FAR GREATER THAN IF YOU TRY TO THROW TEN MILLION DOLLARS A CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS IN TEN YEARS. I CAN GUARANTEE THAT. WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME AND WE'RE TALKING BILLIONS ABSTAINED OUT TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS ABSCESS SO TAKE A PIECE OF THAT YEAH. NO I AGREE BUT- GETTING THERE. THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT WE LOOK PEOPLE LIKE YOU FOR ISN'T IT I HAVE. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS QUESTIONS THIRTY CHOI I JUST ON OF YOU THINK WE SAVE IN A TEST SO TO THE LAST SO WORRIED THAT THOSE MEN HAVE TO LEAVE A AS OF SO.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JACK YOU ON THE VICE PRESIDENT OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY FOR THE AND HELP PARTY IN CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN- TO SOMEONE WERE STONE'S POINT WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE A PLAN- THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESSES POVERTY.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR CAN BE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY- STEPHANIE I'VE LEARNED FROM THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. WE REPRESENT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY AND NATIONALLY ACCREDITED NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION STATE WIDE. DOZENS OF WHOM PROVIDE THE T. H. P. AND M. D. PROGRAMS. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I THINK THAT WE CONSISTENTLY HEARD THIS AFTERNOON THE COMMON THEME IS THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THE SUPPORT OF SERVICES. THE T. H. P. AND MD PROGRAMS KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. THE CHALLENGE IS THAT WHEN WE SURVEYED ABOUT A HUNDRED PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS TOGETHER WITH JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH. WE FOUND THAT A GOOD 46% OF THEM WERE EITHER REDUCING THE LEVEL OF THEIR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. OR THEY WERE NEEDING TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF HIGH NEED TO USE THAT THEY COULD TAKE INTO THE PROGRAMS. AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT WE ARE CO SPONSORING AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY. IN HOPES THAT WITH TARGETED SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR THE HOUSING COMPONENT OF THE T. H. P. AND M. D. RATE. WE CAN ENABLE THESE PROVIDERS BOTH TO. ENRICH YOUR MAINTAIN THEIR IN WHICH QUALITY OF SERVICES SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE YEAR. BUT. PERHAPS CASSIDY WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A HUNDRED OF YOUTH ON THE WAITING FOR THESE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR WORK.

I'VE HAD YOUTH WHO WERE CLEANING HOMES JUST TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP IN SOMEONE'S CAR IN THE FRONT YARD- THE NORM IS WAITING LESSEN LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR YOU TO ENTER THESE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS. CREATES A HUGE DETRIMENT TO OUR YOUTH THEY ARE ON THE STREETS DURING THIS TIME- AND IT ALSO HAS CREATED AN ISSUE IN THE SENSE THAT MANY OF THE HOUSING PROGRAMS. HAVE TO CHOOSE VERY CAREFULLY- WHAT USE ARE ALLOWED INTO THE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY SPOTS FELT THIS LEAVES THE MOST HONOR YOU USE WITH. OP THEY'D TO BE ON MAY PRETTY. MAN OF. WHO REALLY JUST DON'T HAVE OPTIONS FOR THE HOUSE ISN'T THERE. ON ANY. THE CAN BE PROVIDE TO PROVIDE. MORE HOUSING BADS THESE YOU WHILE CAN. THIS OF SIR. SAN MANY OF THESE YOUTH AND THE TRANSITION HOUSING PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP THESE CONNECTIONS WITH ADULTS.

AS WELL AS ADDRESSING ISSUES FACED BY CURRENT HOMELESS YOUTH AND I THINK PART OF THE PREVENTATIVE- SIDE OF IT IS CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR FOSTER SYSTEM FOR OLDER YOUTH- PART OF THAT IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THE SUPPORT OF PLACEMENT TIAS PAN DE. IS ACCEPTABLE AND IS NOT COMPROMISED STILL PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES TO AVOID KIND OF RESTATING WHAT OTHERS HAVE STATED I WANT TO SHARE SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE TING BILL. AT SUMMER FILLED HANGS ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWO EIGHT EIGHT ZERO THE APPROACH THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS BILL WITH WELL VETTED- A PREVIOUS BILL.
