SENATOR WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DO YOU WANT ME HERE HERE I THINK AT THE TABLE FOR. NICE TO SEE A VERY. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU ALL I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB ONE EIGHTEEN WHICH WILL ESTABLISH THE COMMUNITY RESPONSE INITIATIVE TO STRENGTHEN EMERGENCY SYSTEMS ALSO KNOWN AS THE CRISIS ACT PILOT PROGRAM TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY BASED RESPONSES TO LOCAL EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. YOU KNOW EVERY DAY IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUCCESSFULLY RESPONDING TO VARIOUS TYPES OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. SUCH AS PEOPLE DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS DISABLED INDIVIDUALS HAVING AN EPISODE SOMEONE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SOMEONE DEALING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AB ONE EIGHTEEN IS A REINTRODUCTION OF AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR FROM LAST SESSION WHICH WAS PASSED. WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH HOUSES NOT IN THE BILL ANALYSIS THE BILL WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM STATING THAT THE UNDERLYING GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION IS IMPORTANT. AND IMPLEMENTING AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION WILL HELP OUR COMMUNITIES UNFORTUNATELY- YES IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE LOCATION FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM PROPOSED IN THIS LEGISLATION. MY ADMINISTRATION WILL WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS DURING THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION WHICH IS THIS ONE ON AN IMPLEMENTABLE SOLUTION SO MY OFFICE AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN CORRESPONDING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- SINCE LAST YEAR WE EVEN SPOKE TODAY TO IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY TO OVERSEE THE PILOT PROGRAM. WE KNOW THE INTERACTIONS WITH POLICE CAN BE SCARY AND TRAUMATIZING FOR MANY PEOPLE. AND OFTENTIMES THEY CAN BE DEADLY IN FACT JUST LAST WEEK THE SITE YES CERVANTES. A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MAN WITH AUTISM. WHO HAS THE MENTAL ACUITY OF A SIX YEAR OLD AND IS DEAF IN BOTH EARS. HAVE AN EPISODE- BECAUSE HE WANTED A SNACK. THE POLICE WERE CALLED. I HE WAS SUBDUED IN HIS DINING ROOM IN FRONT OF HIS MOTHER AND SHOT IN THE BACK HE IS CURRENTLY IN THE HOSPITAL AT SAINT FRANCIS MEDICAL CENTER IN LYNNWOOD. AND HE WILL BE PARALYZED UNABLE TO WALK AGAIN. BECAUSE HE WAS STAFF IS DEAF. AND AUTISTIC. ALMOND HAVING SOMEONE COME IN TO RESPOND. TO HIM NOT WANTING A SNACK WITHOUT. THE KIND OF COMPASSION BUT ALSO RESPONSIVENESS TO TRAINING OUR RESULTED- IN HIS SPINAL CORD INJURIES. WE KNOW THAT IN CITIES ACROSS THE STATE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE RESPONDING SUCCESSFULLY TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS INVOLVING ON HOUSE PEOPLE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES PEOPLE EXPOSED TO VIOLENCE AND PEOPLE IMPACTED BY NATURAL OR CLIMATE DISASTERS. IN L. A. FOR EXAMPLE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SECOND CALL IN MUSTARD SEED INTERVENE TO BUILD PEACE FATHERS AND FAMILIES OF SAN JOAQUIN WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CITY TO ENSURE ITS MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS ARE SHELTERED WE KNOW BERKELEY FROM FREE CLINIC PROVIDES HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE AND HOUSED. AND SUFFER FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE. WHEN THESE GROUPS ARE RESOURCE TO DO THIS CRITICAL WORK ALL OF US BENEFIT AND WE ALSO SAVE- DESPITE THE POSITIVE IMPACT AND COST SAVING POSSIBILITIES OF COMMUNITY ORIENTED RESPONSES TO EMERGENCIES CALIFORNIA HAS DONE LITTLE. TO SUPPORT AND SCALE THESE EFFORTS OR TO SET STATEWIDE POLICY FOR GUIDANCE SO INSTEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE CONTINUING. TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES BETTER SUITED TO PEER SUPPORT EXPERTS MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS OR CRISIS COUNSELORS TRYING TO DE ESCALATE AND RESOLVE CRISES. THERE IS ALSO A COST SAVINGS BENEFITS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I LOVE TALKING ABOUT MONEY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WORKERS COMP COSTS FOR SWORN EMPLOYEES WERE A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE L. A. FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS SPENDING ALMOST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON OVERTIME JUST TO COVER SHIFTS LEFT VACANT BY INJURED FIREFIGHTERS. AND ACCORDING TO THE L. A. CONTROLLER ONE IN THREE LAPD OFFICERS FILED A WORKERS OMP CLAIM COSTING NEARLY NEARLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND LEAVING 15% OF THE DEPARTMENTS HUMAN RESOURCES ON THE SIDELINES. WE KNOW THAT ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS WAS SPENT NATIONWIDE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ON LAW ENFORCEMENT JUST FOR TRANSPORTING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND THESE NUMBERS GO UP EVERY YEAR. WE KNOW THESE JOBS ARE STRESSFUL WE KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IS OVERWHELMED OVERWORKED BURNED OUT. AND WE KNOW THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE BEING ASKED TO. MORE AND MORE RESPOND TO THESE SITUATIONS WHERE MAYBE THEY'RE NOT NEEDED OR THEY'RE NOT NEEDED FIRST. AB ONE EIGHTEEN IS NOT ABOUT REPLACING THIS IMPORTANT AND EXISTING WORKFORCE BUT A BOUT EXPANDING THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEY CAN PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES WERE OFFERING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO FOCUS ON ISSUES MORE SUITED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING. SO WITH ME TODAY AND SUPPORTER SHARON WATKINS WAS SILICON VALLEY DE BUG ANA SANTA BOB WAKEN FOUNDEROF MENTAL HEALTH FIRST SACRAMENTO MOVE THE BILL.

FOUND THERE WAS A FACEBOOK VIDEO IN MY DISTRICT OF A DARK INTERSECTION AND THEN THE STARK INTERSECTION THIS DAD PULLED OVER BECAUSE IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK IN I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY FOUR THIRTY ASH. AND IT WAS DARK AND IN THE INTERSECTION SIX CARS BLEW PAST- WHAT IS NORMALLY A RED STOP LIGHT AND THE LAST CAR IT ANOTHER CAR- ARE CITIES IN NEED A RESOURCES A NEED FLEXIBILITY- AND ACCESS TO GRANTS THAT HELLO YES HAS PROVIDED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE THE STATE AND FREQUENCY EXPERIENCES BECAUSE THE STATE FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCES COMPLEX AND OFTEN OVERWHELMING DISASTERS. SUCH AS WILDFIRES FLOODS. MUDSLIDES EARTHQUAKES DOWN I'M FAILURE. AND GASLY. PS PS AND UNPLANNED EMERGENCY OUTAGES HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BECOME THE NEW NORMAL FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THE MAJORITY OF MY CONSTITUENTS. THOUGH THE STATE HAS ALLOCATED SOME GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THESE FUNDS BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE SURFACE OF WHAT IS NEEDED. AND WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE OR TRANSPARENT. AB FOUR EIGHTEEN WILL FORMALLY ESTABLISH A MUCH NEEDED FUNDING STREAM. FOR REQUIRE MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THEIR DISTRIBUTION. BY DOING SO THIS BILL WILL HELP CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND TRIBES ENSURE THE CONTINUITY. OF THE CRITICAL SERVICES FOR THE RESIDENTS DURING PS PS EVENTS OR OTHER EMERGENCY POWER OUTAGES.

WE APPRECIATE THE ALLOCATION OF GRANT FUNDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND THE SIGNIFICANT STATE COMMITMENT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS TO ADDRESS UNANTICIPATED PS PS RELATED COSTS MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABUSE THESE RESOURCES TO PROCURE BACKUP POWER SUPPLIES FOR CRITICAL FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ALSO TO SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS IN OTHER CASES THE FUNDS ARE USED TO PRE INSTALL ELECTRICAL UPGRADES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT MOBILE GENERATORS DURING THE PS PS EVENT OR OTHER EMERGENCY. WE SUPPORT EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTEEN THE EFFORTS TO CODIFY THIS PROGRAM AND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING ADOPTED TO BROADEN LOCAL DISCRETION AS TO HOW THEY SHOULD BE USED.
