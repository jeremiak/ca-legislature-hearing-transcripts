NOT SPECIFY HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE

INTERNAL UC PRIORITIZATION. IS

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.119

CALIFORNIA 20% BUT IT IS UP TO

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.432
THE LEGISLATURE TO CHOOSE WHICH

PROJECTS FROM THOSE THAT APPLIED

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:56.375
WILL BE FUNDED. MMHM. R. N. WHAT

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:58.844
WOULD BE DROPPED DOWN ON THAT.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.846
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WITH REGARD

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:04.216
TO THE UC HASTINGS PROJECT. WHAT

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:06.985
IT MEANS SIR IS THAT- THERE'S

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:08.020
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:09.621

HASTINGS- UNIVERSITY OF

CALIFORNIA HAS PUT FORWARD SIX

HUNDRED MILLION IN APPLICATIONS

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:19.631
AND UC HASTINGS HAS THEIR OWN

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:21.633
APPLICATIONS SO WHAT IT MEANS IS

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.303
THAT- WITH THE EXISTING AMOUNT

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:26.605

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:34.313
BETWEEN THOSE VARIOUS PROJECTS.

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:36.448
I'M SORRY I STILL DON'T

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:39.785
UNDERSTAND IF. WHERE DOES UC

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:42.554
HASTINGS STAND IN THAT.

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.423
CURRENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.258
MAKING ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.060
TENDERED TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:51.563
MARCH FIRST- WE WERE WAITING-

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.700
INSIGHTS AS TO HOW WE FARE THAT

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:58.136
THAT THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS. I

00:18:58.203 --> 00:18:59.037
THINK I WOULD JUST MAKE A

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:00.939
STATEMENT GIVEN ALL THIS

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:03.342
DISCUSSION THAT. I THINK THIS

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:05.077
PROJECT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:08.580
HASTINGS AND IT HAS BENEFITS

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:11.116
THAT ARE BEYOND JUST THE HOUSING

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:12.851
IN TERMS OF WHAT IT BRINGS AND

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:15.888
SO- I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:18.290
SEE DOES ITS INTERNAL SCORING

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:22.361
OR- HOWEVER I SAID BUT- I THINK

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:23.495
THIS PERSON WOULD LOOK VERY

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.497
FAVORABLY ON THIS AND WE JUST

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:28.433
HOPE THAT IT. COMPETES ARE WELL

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.604
WITHIN THE- UC SYSTEM BUT IT. I

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:33.739
DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.474
ANY FURTHER ON THIS- I THINK

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:37.709
THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO AND

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:43.415
THEN- MAYBE WE ARE ONE LAST

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:46.051
QUESTION OF THE HASTINGS

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.353

THE LIBRARY AND MY OTHER

00:23:58.136 --> 00:23:59.704
QUESTION IS SOMEBODY THAT IS A-

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.406
FAMILY HISTORIAN THE ONE THING

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:03.909
THAT WAS UNCLEAR FROM THE AGENDA

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:06.611
MATERIALS IS. HOW WILL THE

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:08.480
DIGITIZED ITEMS BE MADE

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:10.982
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SO ONCE

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:12.184
THEY ARE DIGITIZED HOW WILL

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.720
THOSE ACT ACTUALLY BE AVAILABLE

00:24:15.787 --> 00:24:19.357
TO PEOPLE. WHAT PRIMARILY

00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:21.393
THROUGH THE STATE LIBRARY'S

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:23.595
CATALOG WHICH I THINK IF YOU

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:25.163
LOOK AT THE- THE SPREADSHEET

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.666
THAT JASON WAS JUST REFERRING TO

00:24:27.732 --> 00:24:29.901
ON PAGE EIGHT. I MEAN ONE OF THE

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:32.604
FIRST THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:35.407
GET A CATALOG IN A POSITION

00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:38.543
WHERE WE AND- HAVE IT. SORT OF

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.046
TOUCH ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT- BUT

00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:44.950
OUR- ARE BEING HELD BY THE STATE

00:24:45.016 --> 00:24:48.920
LIBRARY. OKAY SO I CAN I ANSWER

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:50.488
YOUR QUESTION YES BECAUSE

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.924
BASICALLY IF IT'S DIGITIZED IT'S

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:54.926
ADDED TO THE CATALOG AND A GOOD

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.461
KNOWLEDGE THIS DIGITIZED AND

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:57.996
THEN ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC

00:24:58.063 --> 00:24:59.331
CAN ACCESS YOUR CATALOG

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:00.665
COMMITTEE FRIGHT I MEAN THE FLIP

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:02.100
SIDE OF THAT IS SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.602
IF YOU GO TO THE STATE LIBRARY'S

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:05.770
WEBSITE AND YOU SEARCH THE

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:08.840
WEBSITE- AT THE MOMENT RIGHT YOU

00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:12.010
MAY FIND THINGS THERE. RIGHT BUT

00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:13.578
YOU WON'T FIND IN THE CATALOG

00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:15.247
AND SO PART OF THIS PROCESS IS

00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:17.749
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GO TO THE

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:19.451
CATALOG AND LOOK FOR THE STATE

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:23.421
LIBRARY'S DATABASE OF. EXECUTIVE

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:24.856
ORDERS AND PROCLAMATIONS- YOU

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:27.092
YOU MAY NOT FIND THAT RIGHT IN

00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:28.894
THE CATALOG BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.662
IN THE SEARCH BUT WEBSITE. SO

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:33.131
PART OF IT IS IT'S NOT EXACTLY

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.300
LIKE YOU KNOW EMERGENCY SERVICES

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.202
LOOKS AT IT BUT- PART OF IT IS

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.703
THIS IDEA OF INTER OPERABILITY

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.573
RIGHT SO IF YOU. I DO. SUPPORT

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.974
ON THE WEBSITE YOU CAN FIND AT

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.843
AND IF YOU SEARCH ON THE CATALOG

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.212
YOU CAN FIND WELL. I WOULD JUST

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:49.948
SUGGEST IS A FREQUENT USER OF

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:52.584
SUCH THINGS THAT SOMEHOW. IN THE

00:25:52.651 --> 00:25:55.754
PROCESS A USER NEEDS TO TRIP

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.956
OVER A STATEMENT THAT SAYS.

00:25:58.023 --> 00:25:59.257
SOMETHING'S ARMAMENT CATALOG DO

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:00.926
A KEYWORD SEARCH AND FIND

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.527
SOMETHING THAT PUTS THAT OUT

00:26:02.594 --> 00:26:04.629
THERE AND SUGGESTED FOR THEM SO

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:07.499
THAT THEY KNOW. NO BIG DEAL IT'S

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:13.371
JUST. THE YOU KNOW. IT YOU AND I

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:15.607
HAVE TALKED- I DID A BILL I WAS

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:17.175
A DIAZ. OVER THE FACT THAT

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:20.245
SOMETHING LIKE 8210% OF WHAT'S

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:23.048
HELD IN THE STATE ARCHIVES.

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:24.049
WHICH IS NOT UNDER YOUR

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:25.817
JURISDICTION. ARE HELD IN THE

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:27.652
STATE ARCHIVES WAS WAS

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:29.654
CONFIDENTIAL AND CLOSE TO THE

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.456
PUBLIC AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE.

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:33.291
PRISON RECORDS FROM THE EIGHTEEN

00:26:33.358 --> 00:26:35.093
HUNDREDS SOME CIVIL WAR PENSIONS

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.362
MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. THINGS

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:39.030

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.799
THEIR CHILDREN PROBABLY HAD LONG

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:42.934
SINCE DIED IF NOT GRANDCHILDREN

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:44.736
AND SODA THE CONCERN FOR

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:47.772
CONFIDENTIALITY WAS WIFE. INDEED

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:49.007
IT IS THE BILL ALLOWED THE

00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:51.142
ARCHIVIST OPEN THESE AND SO THEY

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:52.978

POINT OUT THAT IT'S A THERE ARE

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.908

OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD AS

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:47.679
REGULATED TO. OTHERS A SMALL

00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:49.013
COMPONENT THAT'S ONGOING SO

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.882
THERE ARE SOME ONGOING POSITIONS

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:52.217

PAGE EIGHT- THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:57.956
ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD HAVE SORT

00:30:58.022 --> 00:30:58.823
OF PERMANENT POSITION SO THAT

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.797
THE BUDGET YEAR. SO IT'S A

00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:08.399
COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:09.500
ACTUALLY USE BUT YOU COULD THINK

00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:11.469
OF THEM. I AM VERY FOCUSED THE-

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.338
PROPOSAL'S REALLY BEING OVER A

PERIOD. AND THEN THERE WAS A

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:17.809
QUESTION AS TO HOW MUCH FUNDING

INTERESTINGLY IT'S EXACTLY THE

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:45.930
SAME PANEL SO WHAT LET'S BEGIN

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:48.232

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:08.786
CONTINUATION OF ONLINE UP

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:09.687
SKILLING AND PROFESSIONAL

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.556
DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TO LOCAL

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:13.024
LIBRARY PATRONS CURRENTLY

00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:14.425
SUPPORTED BY FUNDS FROM THE

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:16.394
FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:19.130
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT THAT I

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:19.931
SHALL CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:20.665
AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:21.699
QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:24.936
AND I KNOW I HAVE A QUESTION OF

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:28.706
A- L. A. O. WE- WON. A

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:29.907
REASONABLE WAY TO VIEW THIS

00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:31.609
PROPOSAL IS TO TREAT IT AS A

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:33.678
PILOT SO CURRENTLY THE STATE

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:36.581
LIBRARY. IS SPENDING FOUR POINT

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:38.883
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. OF FEDERAL

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.019
RELIEF FUNDS ON- LIBRARY BASE

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:45.456
WRKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS-

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.258
THIS PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND THAT

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.493
FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS FOR

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.794
THAT WHAT WHAT USING GENERAL

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.229
FUND SO THAT WOULD GIVE. THREE

00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:52.864
YEARS OF ACTIVITY THAT THE

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.900
LEGISLATURE COULD THEN EVALUATE

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:58.035
. SO THE QUESTION IN OUR MIND IS

00:33:58.102 --> 00:34:00.204
THIS A INITIATIVE THAT THE

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.939
LEGISLATURE THINGS IS PROMISING

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.142
IS WORTH PILOTING. AND WE THINK

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:05.543
THE KEY CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.844
BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE IS STILL

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:09.347
IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION

00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:10.882
IT'S DIFFICULT TO GAUGE THAT-

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:11.883
THE STATE LIBRARY STILL

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:13.317
COLLECTING INFORMATION ON THE

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:14.552
NUMBER OF PATRONS WHO ARE

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:16.721
PARTICIPATING. PATRON

00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:19.056
DEMOGRAPHICS UPDATE PARTICIPANT

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:20.725
OUTCOMES IN THESE PROGRAMS

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:24.362
THAT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:24.962
EFFECTIVENESS AND THE OVERALL

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.597
IMPACT. THE STATE LIBRARY DID

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:27.999
PROVIDE US ONE HE MEASURE WHICH

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:30.568
IS THE NUMBER OF COURSE HOURS-

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:32.837
COMPLETED THUS FAR- WHICH THEY

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:35.139
ESTIMATE WHICH THEY SAID WAS

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:35.706
OVER TWENTY THOUSAND COURSE

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:39.110
HOURS- GAUGE. THEY SORT OF

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:41.212
IMPACT OF THAT WE CONVERTED THAT

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:42.547
USING A SORT OF A FULL TIME

00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:43.848
EQUIVALENT BASIS IT'S A SIMILAR

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:45.049
APPROACH WE USE FOR THE

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:46.951
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I GOT AN

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:48.920
ESTIMATE OF ABOUT FORTY FULL

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.588
TIME EQUIVALENT PARTICIPANTS.

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.890
NOW WOULD SUGGEST A AVERAGE COST

00:34:52.957 --> 00:34:54.892
ABOUT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:55.993
DOLLARS PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.795
PARTICIPATE WHICH IS QUITE A BIT

00:34:57.862 --> 00:34:58.796
HIGHER THAN WHAT THE STATE

00:34:58.863 --> 00:34:59.931
PROVIDES TO THE COMMUNITY

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:01.432
COLLEGES. NOW HE INITIATIVE

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:02.834
STILL ONGOING SO IT'S LIKELY

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.169
THAT MORE COURSE HOURS WILL BE

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:06.871
COMPLETED. BUT AGAIN BECAUSE OF

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.607
THE LACK OF SORT OF THE DATA AND

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:10.374
SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND

00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:12.076
THE NUMBER OF COURSE HOURS WE

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:13.444
THINK IT'S A BIT PREMATURE TO BE

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.879
SUPPORTING THIS INITIATIVE AT

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:18.216
THIS. TIME WE RECOMMEND

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:19.217
REJECTING THE PROPOSAL. ONE

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:19.984
OTHER POINT I'D LIKE TO.

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:21.319
REJECTED THE PROPOSAL WOULD NOT

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:23.221
BE THE FINAL WORD ON IT.

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:24.522
FOLLOWING THE STATE LIBRARY

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:26.290
CONSOLE THE MINISTER IT'S

00:35:26.357 --> 00:35:27.391
FEDERAL FUNDING COULD STILL

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:28.593
IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM COLLECTED

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:30.628
ON IT. THEY WERE TO COLLECT A

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:32.363
LOT OF THE DATA THAT ADDRESSES

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.931
MANY OF OUR CONCERNS. THE STATE

00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:35.099
LIBRARY COULD RETURN THE

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.801
LEGISLATURE TO FUTURE YOUR- AND

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:39.036
REQUEST FUNDING FOR IT. THANK

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:42.240

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:44.642
TO THE STATE WEBER. IT'S GREAT

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.577
WORKERS FROM THE STATE LIBRARY.

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:52.517
UP. I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:55.786
THAT WE REQUESTED THE ADDITIONAL

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:58.289
FUNDING TO CREATE A PERIOD OF

00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:00.057
TIME WHERE WE COULD BETTER

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:03.327
ASSESS THE PROGRAM'S EFFICACY

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:04.161
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE USING

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:06.797
IT AND OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:09.433
BE ABLE TO ON AN ANNUAL OR EVEN

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.003

WHAT'S BEING PROVIDED. WHAT WE

00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:15.239
FOUND SO FAR IN THE REASON WE

SUBMITTED THE BUDGET REQUEST IS-

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.913
THANK THANKS ENERGY MAY BE TOO

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:23.080

WHICH IS A FOOD INSECURITY AMONG

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:10.594
CHILDREN. AND IT AIMS TO ADDRESS

PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.877
ON- ESTABLISHING MORE LIBRARY

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:29.313
SITES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.815
THE FEDERAL SUMMER MEALS PROGRAM

. THIS IS A REASONABLE- OVERALL

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:35.953
OBJECTIVE BUT WE HAVE THREE

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.755
CONCERNS THE FIRST CONCERN AS A

00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:39.523
CONCERNED YOU PRODUCE REYES IN

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.959
PAST YEARS WHICH IS THAT THE

TO DELIVER- FEDERAL SUMMER MEALS

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:59.276
. I'M THINKING USUALLY WANT TO

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:01.979
RAISE IS THAT- SOME OTHER STATE

00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:03.747
ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN.

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:05.316

BE ATTENDING- SCHOOLS DURING THE

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.233
SUMMER- IT FOR PARTS OF THE

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.234
SUMMER THAT WAY THAT COULD

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:26.070
RESULT IN AND I'M MORE

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:27.071

THAT IS HARD TO. GAUGE AT THIS

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.677
MOMENT. AND THE THIRD ISSUE WE

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:04.414
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND ONE IS

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:08.552
THAT A COMMON QUESTION OF LAST

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:10.186
YEAR FOREIGN THIRTY NINE MILLION

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:12.088
DOLLARS WAS PUT IN THE LIBRARY

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:13.857
INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:15.926
WHICH YOU WENT OVER A MINUTE

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:19.963
AGO. AND INTERESTING Y. E. WHEN

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.198
I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY SIXTEEN OR

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.199
EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO THE VOTERS

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:24.834
APPROVED A LIBRARY BOND ACT IT

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:26.603
WAS FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.139
SO HERE WE ARE WHEN WE HAVE ONE

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:31.308
TIME MNEY PUTTING IN THE BUDGET

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.510
ONE TIME ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT.

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.078
THE VOTERS HAD APPROVED YEARS

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:36.680
AGO AND WE DID IT WITHOUT ANY

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:40.283
INTEREST COSTS THE ONE QUESTION

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:45.789
I HAVE IS THAT. OF THE PROJECT

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.924
STARTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT A

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:49.626

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:55.098
THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:55.699
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DOES THAT

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:57.667
MEAN THAT THESE FUNDS ARE FULLY

00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:59.736
SUBSCRIBED AND IT'S JUST A

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:01.338
MATTER OF MAKING SURE THEY'RE

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:05.108
DONE BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:06.209
FOUR IS ALL THIS MONEY OUT THE

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:08.979
DOOR. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:15.418
THAT- THE MONEY CAN BE PUT OUT

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:18.355
THE DOOR OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD

00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:20.523
AND THE INTENT WAS IT IN OUR

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:24.027
EXPERIENCE- AT AT THE LIBRARY.

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:25.395
YOU KNOW OFTEN THE PEOPLE THAT

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:27.464
WOULD BENEFIT MOST FROM THE

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.865
GRANT PROGRAM ARE THE ONES WHO

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:31.201
ARE LEAST PREPARED OR HAVE THE

00:54:31.267 --> 00:54:33.436
LEAST RESOURCES. YOU KNOW PUT

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:35.505
TOGETHER AN APPLICATION AND SO

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:38.475
THE THINKING WAS THAT IF WE HAD

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:39.643
THIS MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GIVE IT

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:42.412
OUT OVER OVER A TIME PERIOD THAT

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:43.813
WE BE ABLE TO CATCH AND HELP

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:47.317
MORE MORE OF THAT CATEGORY OF

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:51.855
LIBRARY OR AT. NO I. DON'T THINK

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:52.922
WHAT I WAS JUST TRYING TO

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.824
UNDERSTAND. WHAT I WAS TRYING TO

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.760
UNDERSTAND IS I THINK THE

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:58.294
IMPLICATION WAS IS THAT THE

THE BUDGET SPECIFIES THE STATE

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:13.970
LIBRARY SURE REQUIRE A LOCAL

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:16.039
MATCH. AND I'M JUST KIND OF

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:17.607
CURIOUS BECAUSE I'M I'M THINKING

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:20.076
OF MY- AREAS SUCH AS MY CITY

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:21.845
WHICH IS I WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:24.147
PASS ANY BONDS- FOR

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:26.249
CONSTRUCTION- IT JUST IN GENERAL

00:56:26.316 --> 00:56:28.618
IN IN OUR AREA EVEN WITH THE

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:31.121
SENATOR'S ENDORSEMENT. THIS IS

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:32.756
PRIOR TO THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:35.658
NOW I'M GLAD TO CLARIFY YEAH-

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:37.794
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION BUT

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:40.430
MY QUESTION IS- HAVE YOU HAD ANY

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:42.799
FEEDBACK OR ANY COMMENTARY FROM

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:44.234
OUR LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.969
STATE AND HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:47.570
BE FOR THEM TO HAVE THOSE

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:50.006
MATCHING FUNDS AVAILABLE. OR BE

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:53.276
PREPARED TO. IN ORDER TO HAVE

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:56.713
ACCESS TO THESE CRAMPS. THE

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.783
SHORT THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES SO

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:01.217
THE BUDGET THE BUDGET BILL

00:57:01.284 --> 00:57:03.520
CONTEMPLATES A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:06.189
MATCH. BUT KIND OF A FEW

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:08.391
PARAGRAPHS DOWN FROM THAT IT

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:11.661
ALSO DISCUSSES THE ABILITY.

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:15.098
BASED ON. IT'S A FORMULA THAT

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:15.832
CALCULATES KIND OF THE PER

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:18.334
CAPITA NOT KIND OF IT'S A

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.103
FORMULA THAT CALCULATES THE-

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:20.870
CAPITA SPENDING IN A

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:22.939
JURISDICTION FOR LIBRARIES. AND

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:25.308
SO THE LOWER THE PER CAPITA

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:28.545
SPENDING IS IN A JURISDICTION.

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:31.347
THE MORE THE LIBRARY CAN REDUCE

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:33.049
THE MATCH THAT'S REQUIRED SO

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:34.717
THERE IS THERE IS A PROVISION IN

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:37.053
THERE THERE'S I THINK THERE'S

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.522
THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS. OF THE

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:42.258
PER CAPITA SPENDING SO WE HAVE

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:45.461
THE FLEXIBILITY- THANKS TO THE

00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:47.530

OF MATCH WHAT WOULD BE THE LEAST

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:04.480
AMOUNT OF MATCHING FUNDS THAT

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:06.549

SOLELY- ARE YOU PROPOSALS HERE

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.422
THAT HAVE AN OVERARCHING-

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.425
OBJECTIVE OF HELPING THE STATE

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.393
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:06.162
WHICH IS A OVER ARCHING

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:08.097
REASONABLE OBJECTIVE- BUT

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.400
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:14.670
LACKING IN THESE PROPOSALS ARE.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.707
BUDGET LANGUAGE AND THE LANGUAGE

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.476
DOESN'T SET FORTH OBJECTIVES FOR

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:22.011
THE FUNDS IT DOES NOT SET FORTH

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.446
CLEAR PARAMETERS OVER HOW THE

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.048
FUNDS ARE TO BE USED AS AN

01:01:25.114 --> 01:01:26.949
ESTABLISH ANY SORT OF RETRACTED

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.818
REPORTING TO ASSIST WITH

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:31.721
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. WHEN THE

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:33.056
LEGISLATURE RECEIVED PROPOSALS

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:34.557
LIKE THIS IT OFTEN FACES

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.225
PRESSURE TO TRY TO CORRECT FOR

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:38.127
SOME OF THESE DEFICIENCIES AND

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.095
THAT TAKES TIME AWAY FROM

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.798
LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO CRAFTED

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.200
ITS OWN BUDGET PACKAGE. SO GIVEN

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:45.802
THOSE ISSUES WE THINK THE

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:48.538
LEGISLATURE CURRENT- TREAT THIS

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.440
PACKAGE- AND THEN PRIORITIZE

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:51.607
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THIS PACKAGE

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.843
DIFFERENTLY PRIORITIZING SOME

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.179
MORE THAN OTHERS. WE THINK THE

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:58.281
HIGHEST PRIORITY AREA HERE COULD

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:00.349
BE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH.

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:01.350
SUPPORTING MORE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.119
RESEARCH COULD HELP THE STATE

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.154
ADVANCE- IT'S CLIMATE MITIGATION

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:09.425
GOALS. AND HELP WITH- COORDINATE

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:15.665
LOCAL LAPTOP- ADAPTATION EFFORTS. BERMAN IS ALSO REASONABLE USE

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:18.134
OF ONE TIME FUNDING. THAT'S SORT

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.368
OF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:20.736
IN PURSUING MORE RESEARCH WE

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:23.072
THINK THERE ARE- SEVERAL CHANGES

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:23.739
A LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE TO THE

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:26.175
PROPOSAL- TWO KEY AREAS WITHIN

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.610
THE LEGISLATURE COULD FOCUS ON

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:30.413
IS ENSURING. A MORE COORDINATION

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.647
BETWEEN YOU SEE IN THE STATE'S

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.716
VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.318
AND NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES.

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:36.719
AND WE ALSO RECOMMENDED JUST

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:39.522
MORE STATUTORY GUIDANCE OVER THE

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.290
GOALS OF THE FUNDS THAT SETTING

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:42.658
THE PARAMETERS ARE HOW THE FUNDS

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:45.228
TO BE USED AND ESTABLISHING

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:47.029
REPORTING LANGUAGE. WITH REGARD

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.431
TO THE PROPOSED CLIMATE

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.466
TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS WE THINK

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.435
THAT COULD BE TREATED AS A LOWER

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.170
PRIORITY RELATIVE TO RESEARCH.

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:55.071
REPORTING MORE CLIMATE

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:57.173
TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS COULD HAVE

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.008
SOME OF THE SAME BENEFITS AS

01:02:59.075 --> 01:02:59.876
SUPPORTING MORE RESEARCH TO THE

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.944
EXTENT THA IT. FOSTERS THE

01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:03.713
FORMATION OF NEW INDUSTRIES THAT

01:03:03.779 --> 01:03:06.215
CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:06.782
HELP ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:09.051
ISSUES. THAT'S WHAT THE STATE

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.821
HAS MANY NUMEROUS- ECONOMIC

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:13.923
INNOVATION INITIATIVES AS MANY

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.691
EXISTING INCUBATORS INCLUDING A

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.860
FEW REGULATORS A FOCUS ON

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:20.062
CLIMATE ISSUES. THERE'S ALSO

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:22.031
JUST A LOT OF BASIC INFORMATION

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:22.999
LACKING IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.367
EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:25.668
KNOW THE LOCATION OF THE

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:29.939
PROPOSED INCUBATORS OTHER SCOPE

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.040
. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE THINK

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:32.341
OF THE LEGISLATURE WERE

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:32.975
INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING THIS

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.444
PROPOSAL. IT WE THINK IT COULD

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.579
DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.881
UNIVERSITY TO COME BACK WITH A

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.717
MORE DETAILED PROPOSAL. FINALLY

REGARDING THE WORK FORCE ALMOND

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:45.488
OF THIS PROPOSAL- WE THINK YOU

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.156
COULD TREAT THIS AS THE LOWEST

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.057
PRIORITY AT THE STATE IS ALREADY

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.892

SIMILARITIES TO- THE UC PROPOSAL

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:02.305
. FOR THIS REASON WE THINK YOU

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:03.573
COULD REJECT THIS PROPOSAL

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.575

COMMENT AID THAT IS AS SOMEBODY

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.731
WHO WAS US SECRETARY FOR NATURAL

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:19.001
RESOURCES AND IT WAS MENTIONED-

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:21.771
ALIGNING WITH THE AGENCIES IN-

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:23.272
THE ELIAS'S COMMENTS I WOULD

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.007
HAVE DIED FOR THIS APPLICATION

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:30.112
THIS. IS THROWING IN OUR A AND I

SUPPORT. A THIS. ONE ARM ON

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:36.986
CLEAR ON IS I AGREE. ARE WITH

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:38.587
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:40.656
COMMENT ABOUT THE LACK OF

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.057
DIRECTION OR LACK OF

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:43.559
COORDINATION WITH THE AGENCIES

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:47.296
IN. ARE THE IMPORTANT THING IS

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.965
THE STATE'S POLICY. ALL SEIZE ON

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:52.168
CLIMATE ARE BASED ON SCIENCE THE

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:55.805
QUESTION IS DO WHAT WE NEED AT

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:57.840
THE AGENCIES ALIGNED WITH THE

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.276
RESEARCHER AND FREQUENTLY I SAW

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:02.478
THIS IN THE OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:05.080
WHICH IS. OCEAN RESEARCHERS FROM

01:08:05.147 --> 01:08:08.017
ACROSS THE STATE THE DID

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:08.918
RESEARCH IN RELATION TO THE

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:11.020
STATE THAT MANY TIMES THEY DID

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:13.489
RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:15.191
THEIR OWN NEEDS WORK. R. FOR

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:17.760
RESEARCH NOT WHAT ALIGNED WITH

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.895
THE STATE PROGRAMS ON OCEAN AND

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:22.364
I THINK THERE'S THE POTENTIAL

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.200
FOR THAT HAPPENING HERE. AND WE

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:28.037
STILL. ARE NEED OUR OUR WAY TO

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:31.907
QUANTIFY- GREENHOUSE GAS

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:34.810
EMISSIONS SAVINGS FROM PROGRAMS

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.345
THAT AFFECT NATURAL AND WORKING

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:40.015
LANDS WE STILL NEED TO KNOW SOME

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:42.284
OF THE SCIENCE OF OCEANS AS TO

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:45.087
WHETHER OR NOT CERTAIN THINGS.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.555
CAN DEAL WITH OCEAN

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.091
ACIDIFICATION AND SO THE

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:52.328
QUESTION IS CAN WE USE THIS

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:55.364
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. AND UC'S

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:58.434
UNIQUE ABILITIES ON RESEARCH TO

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.836
ALIGN WITH THE RESEARCH NEEDS

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:03.005
FOR STATE AGENCIES AND THE STATE

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:05.774
CLIMATE PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.109
POINT WAS MADE BY THE

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.811
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND I THINK

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:11.447
IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO. WHAT WHAT

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.649
I WOULD HOPE IS I THINK THE THAT

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.451
IF YOU LISTEN TO THE STATEMENTS

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:17.052
PARTICULARLY THE REPRESENTATIVE

01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:19.021
OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:21.190
THE BULK OF THE STATEMENT WAS

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:22.725
ABOUT CLIMATE AND HOW IT'S

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.760
CHANGING AND THE NEED TO

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.229
ADDRESS. BUT I THINK THE DUMB

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.798
PORTANT THING IS HOW IS THIS

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:30.933
RESEARCH AND HOWARD THESE

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.868
ACTIVITIES GOING TO BE FOCUSED

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.870
IN RELATION TO WHAT WE HAVE TO

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:37.706
DO. AND WE JUST HAVE SO MANY

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:40.943
THINGS AND THEN THE STATE HAS

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:44.980
FACILITATED. ARE AT LEAST FOUR

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:48.450
DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT.

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.753
ARE AND I THINK THE LAST ONE THE

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.655
FOURTH ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN OUT

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:54.423
FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS ALREADY.

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.592
AND IT REALLY LOOKED AT THE

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:58.994
STATE AND IT LOOKED AT. OUR GRID

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:00.362
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:03.165
OUR GRID GIVEN HEAT AND WILDFIRE

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:04.867
IT LOOKED AT SOME OF THE OCEANS

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:07.202
ISSUES. THEY LOOKED AT WILDLIFE

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:08.437
QUARTERS THE FACT THAT THE

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:10.239

COLLEAGUES COULD PERHAPS PROVIDE

01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:53.781
YOU BUT ESSENTIALLY THE

01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:55.850
SHORTHANDED GOALS IS THAT

01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:57.451
WHENEVER THERE IS A DESIRE TO

01:35:57.518 --> 01:36:00.154
DEVELOP A NEW ACADEMIC PROGRAMS

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:02.556
IT ORIGINATES AT THE CAMPUS IN

01:36:02.623 --> 01:36:04.458
ERECTING ORIGINATES WITH THE-

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:07.795
THE ACADEMIC FACULTY AS WELL AS

01:36:07.862 --> 01:36:08.829
THE ADMINISTRATORS ON CAMPUSES.

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:11.198
NOW THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:14.468
THAT YOU NEED FUNDING IN ORDER

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:16.170
TO. HIGHER FACULTY AND STAFF TO

01:36:16.237 --> 01:36:18.606
SUPPORT THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS.

01:36:18.672 --> 01:36:20.808
AND WHEN YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.943
EXISTING DEGREE PROGRAMS AND

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:24.245
NUMBER FACULTIES SPECIALIZE IN

01:36:24.311 --> 01:36:26.080
THOSE OTHER DEGREE PROGRAMS DOES

01:36:26.147 --> 01:36:27.581
TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO DEVELOP

01:36:27.648 --> 01:36:29.550
THOSE PROGRAMS. SO IN THIS

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:30.784
PARTICULAR CASE THAT STANDS

WHAT WHAT FROM YOUR VANTAGE

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:46.133
POINT WOULD BE WOULD BE IF IT

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.735

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:54.008
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE THEN IF THERE

DESIRE TO CREATE A SIMILAR

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.179
LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN DEGREE

01:36:58.245 --> 01:36:59.914
PROGRAM. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:01.048
THAT THE KIDS THAT THE CAMPUS

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:02.449
WOULD PUSH UP TO THE CHANCES

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:04.385
OFFICE ALTERNATELY THE TRUSTEES

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:06.387
APPROVED. THOSE NEW DEGREE

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:08.289
PROGRAMS- AND THEN THEY COULD

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:10.224
GET GOING TRANSPIRING DEVELOPING

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:12.826

FINANCE I SHED TEARS ACTUALLY

02:01:50.036 --> 02:01:51.270
TWO COMPONENTS THAT THIS

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:53.372
PROPOSAL ONE THAT WOULD INCREASE

REASON WAY HER PARKING. IN A

02:02:09.488 --> 02:02:12.525

ALLOW THE PROBE TO. THE STUDENTS

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:20.766
