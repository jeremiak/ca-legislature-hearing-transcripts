BY LEAD AND ARSENIC.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.167
COMMUNITY GROUPS TO LIVE NEAR

HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES ARE

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.337
CONCERNED THAT DETAILS SEE IS

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:20.206

THE REGULATED COMMUNITY IS

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:33.686
CONCERNED ABOUT THE LENGTH OF

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.822
TIME THAT IT TAKES DE TSC TO

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.757

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:44.330
DATE OF THE PERMIT.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:45.698
THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH BOTH THE

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.600
BUDGET AND POLICY PROCESS HAS

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.869
MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO REFORM

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.604
THIS DEPARTMENT AND REGAIN

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.339
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.741
UNFORTUNATELY EACH OF THESE

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.076
ATTEMPTS WERE EITHER FORWARDED

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.345
OR MADE AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.713
THIS IS AN INDICATION THAT THE

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.115
PROBLEMS AFFLICTING THE

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.918
DEPARTMENT ARE FAR REACHING AND

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.119
SYSTEMIC.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.353
DTS SEES CURRENT LEVEL OF

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.157

SUBSTANTIAL HABIT HAZARDOUS

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.894
WASTE PERMIT BACKLOG.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.996
HOWEVER BASED ON SOME OF THE

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:19.098
BUDGET ACTIONS LAST YEAR I FEAR

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.534
THAT DTS SEES FISCAL HEALTH HAS

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.703

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.742
EVEN AT CURRENT LEVELS IN ORDER

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.544

SIMPLY TOO IMPORTANT TO WAIT

IT -- IT'S

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:08.647
LIKELY THAT RESOURCES IS SOME OF

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.415
THE PROBLEM BUT PROBABLY NOT ALL

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.484

ISLANDS AND CALIFORNIA HAD THE

00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:46.311
SMALLEST OFTEN CLEAN UP FRONT OF

FUND WAS LODGED IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:25:54.352 --> 00:25:56.421
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE WAY WE

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:57.656
DESIGN --

00:25:57.722 --> 00:25:59.591
AND PRIORITIZE SITES THAT HAVE

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:01.359
NO RESPONSIBLE PARTY THAT'S AN

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:04.529
ISSUE -- AT

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:07.532
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:11.436
FIND WAS EIGHT TAX --

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:12.237
AND THAT TAX --

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:13.571
EVENTUALLY BECAME PART OF THE

00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:15.106

00:26:15.173 --> 00:26:17.008
LONGER A SUPERFUND TAX --

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:19.778

BACK AND HAVE TO CLEAN UP AGAIN

00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:30.855
WHICH IS THE COMMENT WHEN I WAS

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:31.990
MEETING WITH COMMUNITIES WHY

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:33.158
DOES IT TAKE SO LONG WHY DO WE

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.392
NEED THE SCIENCE TO BE SO

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:35.226
RIGOROUS.

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:37.329
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S A VERY NASTY

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:39.497
TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT SYSTEM

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:40.932
BIOACCUMULATE.

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:42.834
FULL DECADES IF NOT CENTURIES

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:43.835
AND IF WE DON'T CLEAN THEM UP

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:45.303
PROPERLY WILL HAVE TO GO BACK

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.471
AND DO IT LATER.

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:48.173
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:51.876
THE MONEY TO SAY WHEN IT'S CLEAN.

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:52.944

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.905
WE CAME UP WITH THAT THAT WHAT'S

00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:22.607
WHAT THE A PLAN HERE AND THERE

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:24.042
WAS SOME GENERAL FUND YOU COULD

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:25.343
HAVE TO MAKE SOME.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.513
REALLY DIFFICULT DECISIONS I

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.950
MEAN I'M HE PERCENT CLEANED UP

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:34.019
YOU GOTTEN OVER NINE THOUSAND

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:35.587
SITES THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:37.989
THE TAXI THE OF THOSE IN AND IF

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:39.090
YOU DON'T HAVE THE BODIES AND

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.725
DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS YOU COULD

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:41.459
HAVE TO SAY.

00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:43.061
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WORKS

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:44.696
BUT YOU SAY WE'RE GONNA STOP

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:46.264
THIS CLEAN UP WHICH GETS A WHOLE

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:48.266
GROUP OF PEOPLE SCREAMING AT

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.534
PASSED THE PUBLIC HEARING BUT

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.169
THEN AT LEAST EVALUATE AND DO

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:53.638
THE ASSESSMENT OF OUR THESE NINE

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:54.005
THOUSAND SITES.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:59.010
SUPER SERIOUS SERIOUS. NINE AND

00:27:59.077 --> 00:27:59.744
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:00.779
INFORMATION MENTIONED YOU DON'T

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:01.780
HAVE THE INFORMATION AND THAT

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:02.714
SEEMS TO BE SCARY WHEN WE HAVE

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:03.448
THIS.

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.717
THIS GREAT WAVE OF NEW FEDERAL

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:07.519
SITES THAT ARE GOING TO BE.

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:08.720
DELIVER TO OUR DOORSTEP AND I

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:09.988
DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN GIVE US

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:11.356
SOME INSIGHT ON HOW YOU

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:14.025
PRIORITIZE THAT MASSIVE

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:16.694
CHALLENGE JUST TO IDENTIFY WHAT

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:18.563
THE SITES ARE SO THAT THE PUBLIC

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.830
IN.

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:20.131
THE LEGISLATURE IN IN THE

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:22.400
DEPARTMENT KNOW WHAT THE THE

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.636
COURSE WORK IS.

00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:26.071
I I WOULD NEVER WANT TO STOP THE

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:27.839
CLEAN UP HALF WAY THROUGH I MEAN

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:28.840
ONCE WE COMMIT TO CLEANING

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:31.142
SOMETHING UP I THINK WE OWE IT

00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:32.544
TO EVERYONE.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.778
INCLUDING I'M SIDING WITH WITH

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:35.113
WITH YOU AND THE PUBLIC TO MAKE

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.581
SURE WE FINISH CLEANING IT UP IN

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:39.117
TERMS OF THE THE LARGER LIST OLD

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:40.685
LET ME DEAL WITH THE THE

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:42.554
SUPERFUND QUESTION FAST SO --

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.023
WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.624
A SITE ON THE NATIONAL

00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:48.226
PRIORITIES LIST WHICH IS THE

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:50.161
SUPERFUND LIST --

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.663
TO COMMITMENT TO MADE BY THE

00:28:51.729 --> 00:28:53.298
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A LETTER.

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:54.899
THAT THE GOVERNOR --

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:57.702
NOT THIS COMING UP THE PREVIOUS

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.737
GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE OF SIGNED

00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:01.439
SENSE OF THE OPERATION AND

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:04.075
MAINTENANCE OF THE ON GOING OUT

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:06.211
OF THE OF THE CLEANUP ITSELF --

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:08.546
AND THEN OFF TO TEN YEARS TO PAY

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:11.483
THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE --

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:12.684
SO THERE'S A TWO SEPARATE COSTS

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.319
IN THE PAST TEN YEARS WE HAVE A

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:16.554
10% CUT SHALL BE ASIAN AND THEN

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:18.456
IN THE OUT YEARS WE HAVE OF A

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:19.991
FULL OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:22.660
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROJECTED --

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:24.562
EXPENDITURES IN THAT CATEGORY

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:25.930
THEY ARE COMING TO GO UP

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.699
SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE HAVE A

00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:30.201
LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PAY THOSE --

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:31.336
SO.

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.271
THE THESE ON ALL KIND OF

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:36.074
WISHLISTS THIS IS I HAVE TO WE

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.609
WE HAVE --

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:38.276
TO BECAUSE THEY CLEAN UP

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:40.678
STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE OBLIGATED

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:44.215
OURSELVES TO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:45.683
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.417
JUST.

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:47.485
AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE IRON

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:48.186
MOUNTAIN MINE --

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:49.487
WHICH IS ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:50.788
IT WAS DEPOSITING MORE THAN A

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:53.124
TON OF TOXIC MATERIALS INTO THE

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.759
SACRAMENTO RIVER EVERY DAY.

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.861
BEFORE THE CLEAN UP WAS DONE --

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.563
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST TO

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.131
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT ONE

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:02.066
OF THESE SITES COULD BE ONE OF

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:03.768
THE NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.537
AND THEY SPEND MORE THAN SIX

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:06.171
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CLEANING

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:07.839
UP THAT SIDE --

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:09.240
AND THE OPERATION A MAINTENANCE

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.176
THAT SIDE IS GOING TO BE IN THE

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:14.012
MILLIONS EVERY YEAR --

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:16.114
SAYS THAT JUST --

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:17.916
ONE I CAN GO DOWN THE LIST OF

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:19.584
THE HUNDRED AND TEN THAT WE HAVE

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:20.752
BACK EVERY COMMUNITY LIVES NEXT

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.020
A SUPERFUND SITE.

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.421
EVERY COMMUNITY THAT LIVES NEXT

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:25.256
TO A A STATE HAZARDOUS WASTE

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.458
SITE.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:29.194
THEY NEED TO KNOW --

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.796
THAT WE'VE CHARACTERIZED AT

00:30:31.863 --> 00:30:34.599
LEAST TO THE CAST THREE LEVEL.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.701
IT'S MATT --

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.369
THREE ITS PARKOUR ETHYLENE IT'S

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:39.070
T. C. KIND OF WALK ON THE

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:40.872
CONTAMINANTS THAT WITH LOOKING

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:44.175
AT HOW WATER THE EXPOSURE

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:45.677
PATHWAYS IS IN THE GROUND WATER

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:47.612
IT'S VOLATILE ISING UP THROUGH

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:50.782
INTO THE AIR IN THE BUILDING --

00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:53.785
WE HAVE A VERY FOR INSTANCE FOR

00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:56.120
INSTANCE HAS MORE SUPERFUND

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:57.622
SITES IN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:58.356
UNITED STATES.

00:30:58.423 --> 00:31:01.192
SO THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY --

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:03.628
HAD A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.863
ON GROUND WATER WHICH IS VERY

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.267
VERY LOW LYING SAYS THE THAT

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:09.901
CHEMICALS.

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:11.069
IN.

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:13.037
THE WATER VOLATILE EYES INTO THE

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:16.674
AD AND GO INTO THE BUILDINGS --

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:19.611
COLD VAPOR INTRUSION AND BEG

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:20.812
THEIR BUILDINGS ALL OVER SILICON

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:23.147
VALLEY THAT WHERE THIS IS A

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:23.848
SIGNIFICANT --

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:25.617
ISSUE -- WE

00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:27.619
WOULD JUST AT SANDERS IS AN AT

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:31.155
FIELD LEBAR TREE --

00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:33.224
IN SIMI VALLEY.

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:34.359
THAT SHOULD BE A ONE OF THE ONLY

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:35.827
PLACES I MEAN THE UNITED STATES

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:37.061
WHERE THAT WAS A NUCLEAR

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:37.595
MELTDOWN --

00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:38.730
THAT WAS MORE THAN A MILLION

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:40.798
GALLONS OF T. C. E. UM THAT WAS

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.834
PUT INTO THE SOIL THAT SO.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.369
WE HAVE OUR WE'LL KNOW THIS WE

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.337
HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US --

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:48.273
THE EXPENSE I I THINK IT'S GOING

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:50.074
TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:51.542
ANY OF US CAN ANTICIPATE

00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:53.878
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE LEGACY

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:54.846
THAT WE HAVE --

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:57.882
FROM ALL THESE INDUSTRIES --

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.018
THAT TOOK PLACE BEING OF MAINLY

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.719
FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES TO THE

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:03.321
NINETEEN EIGHTIES IN CALIFORNIA

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:05.890
AND SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:08.026
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:09.961
SAYS CHARACTERIZATION IS NUMBER

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:11.663
ONE AND THEN A PLAN.

00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:12.797
WELL WE ALL WERE IN AGREEMENT I

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:14.465
DON'T TO BE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:15.900
THAN ANYONE ELSE I WANT EVERYONE

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.502
TO SAY THIS IS THE LAST THIS

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:18.936
MAKES SENSE WE'VE LOOKED AT IT

00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:20.505
WE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE.

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:23.875
AND WE TRY TO PRIORITIZE IT --

00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:27.445
SENATOR BASED ON THOSE RISK

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:29.013
FACTORS UNKNOWN AND AND NOT

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.149
MAKING UP OUR OWN.

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.884
USING USING SCIENCE IT IS

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.419
ALREADY OUT OF THAT --

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:35.920
AND AND STICKING TO THAT MISSION

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:40.958
UNTIL WE CLEAN IT UP.

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:42.226
THANK YOU SOBRE --

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:44.662
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA.

00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:46.497
THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE A

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:47.498

GOING TO BE LEAVING BUT I HAVE A

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:49.600
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FOR

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:51.269
COLLEAGUES LEADER --

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:53.604
WE PASSED AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:54.572
THREE WHICH CREATED THE BATTERY

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:57.975
FEE -- AND

00:32:58.042 --> 00:32:59.444
WE MADE A PROMISE HERE AND WITH

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.812
A BIPARTISAN PROMISE OF THE

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:02.647
LEGISLATURE NUMBERS WORK ON THAT

00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:03.181
TO THE COMMUNITY --

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:04.449
HOW THOSE FUNDS FOR GOING TO BE

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:06.784
USED WE HAVE NOW SEEN MULTIPLE

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:09.253
BUDGET ALLOCATIONS WHERE IT'S

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.688
BEING USED AS BUDGET GIMMICKS?

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:13.257
ALONG SO IN TWO THOUSAND

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:13.825
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET.

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:15.493
WE TOOK --

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.595
ONE POINT TWO MILLION TO REPAY

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:18.796
THE TIRE BY LOAN.

00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:20.898
WE APPROPRIATE ONE POINT TWO

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:23.868
MILLION TO THE H. W. CA FUNDS WE

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:25.436
APPROPRIATED TEN MILLION TO

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.071
REPAY.

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:28.606
A LOAN A GENERAL FUND LOAN WE

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.408
SAW THAT AGAIN IN IN THIS BUDGET

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:32.243
AND WHILE THERE WAS A VICTORY

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.211
LAP THAT WAS DONE WHEN THE

00:33:33.277 --> 00:33:34.746
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS RELEASED

00:33:34.812 --> 00:33:36.047
IN JERRY.

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:38.649
THAT EX THAT WAS GETTING AN

00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:39.217
INFORMATIONAL FIFTY MILLION

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:42.420
DOLLARS RATING THAT FINE WAS

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:43.821
AGAIN FOR OTHER THINGS.

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:45.022
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE

00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:46.190
THINKING ABOUT AS WE'RE TRYING

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:47.325
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS.

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:48.493
WE CREATED A FINE WITH THE

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.927
PROMISE TO THE COMMUNITY AND

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:51.062
THERE'S LIKE A TRUST AND AS LONG

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:52.263
AS THAT FUND IS BEING SEEN IN

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.865
OTHER WAYS WERE COSTLY VIOLATING

00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:55.400
THAT TRUST AND THE COMMUNITY OUR

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:56.901

YOU KNOW WE ARE LEARNING HAVE

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.343
PATIENCE ON THE GROUND AND THEN

THEY SAID OKAY MAYBE ONLY TO DO

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:08.179
THAT BUT WHY DO YOU KEEPING THIS

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:09.380

THE MONEY HAS BEEN SO AND I

00:34:15.753 --> 00:34:17.054
WOULD LIKE IT TO BE?

THE STATE OF A HUNDRED AND

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:42.346
SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR WHY

WE HAVE AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:52.590
HOMES FROM BACKSIDE. TO CLEAN UP

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:56.627

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.098
SIX POINT FIVE MILLION FOR FOR

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:02.066
THE PARK WAYS TO CLEAN UP.

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:04.936
FROM THE LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND --

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:06.771
BUT THEN WE TOOK AN ADDITIONAL

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:07.839
SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND SO

ON ALL BUSINESSES BASED ON THE

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:53.551
ASSUMPTION THAT ALL BUSINESSES

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:54.652
CREATE ENVIRONMENTAL WASTE.

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:55.853
WHICH WE KNOW ISNOT TRUE BUT

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.555
THAT'S THE THE NATURE OF THE OF

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:59.190
THE REVENUE STREAMS.

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:00.958

SUPERS FUNDS SITES.

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:09.433
BUT OF THERE'S A QUESTIONS BASED

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.334
ON WHAT I HEARD FROM MY

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:11.569
COLLEAGUES IN WHAT I'VE OBSERVED

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:13.237
IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT --

00:36:13.304 --> 00:36:15.606
IS IN DISARRAY --

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:18.943
INABILITY TO CLEAR PERMIT BLOW

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.977
SHARKS FINAL SIR FISCAL

00:36:20.044 --> 00:36:20.778
UNCERTAINTY.

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.647
ON FUND RESERVES --

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.982
AND I SHIP SAME CONCERNS AS

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:27.118

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.691
PRIORITIZING --

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:34.792
THROUGH QUICK QUALITATIVE

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:37.261
ANALYSIS THE THE NATURE OF THE

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:41.232
SEVERITY OF THE TOXIC SITES.

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:41.766
THAT EXIST IN THE STATE OF

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:42.900
CALIFORNIA.

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:43.568
OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE AGENCIES

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:45.303
TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:46.671
LONG TERM STABILITY OF THE DTS

00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:49.774
SEE -- MY

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.142
CONCERN IS A WE HAVE A VERY

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:52.143
FRAGILE ECONOMY WITH OUR

00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:54.145
BUSINESSES THAT ARE.

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:58.115
OVERTAXED AND STRESSED --

00:36:58.182 --> 00:37:01.052
THERE WAS A RECENT --

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:03.187
STUDY THE POLL WAS TAKEN SAID

00:37:03.254 --> 00:37:04.422
53% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:05.856
CONSIDERING LEAVING THE STATE

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.358
AND AND MANY OF THOSE ARE FOR

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.594
BUSINESS REGULATIONS AND TAX

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.361
REASONS.

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:12.363
SO -- IS THE

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.165
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING ANY

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:17.201
GENERAL FUND UTILIZATION FOR

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:17.435
URGENT.

00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:18.569
CLEANUP --

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:20.438
GIVEN THE STATE'S TWENTY ONE

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:21.238
BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:24.208
PURPOSE AND IF THE DEPARTMENT IS

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:26.010
NOT OPERATING EFFICIENCY.

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:28.846
WHICH CREATES MORE MORE COSTS.

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:31.716
SHOULD WE NOT PENALIZE THE

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.551
BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND ACCEPT

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:34.919
THE FACT THAT WERE RUNNING AN

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.687
EFFICIENT BASED ON OUR OWN

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:38.222
LEADERSHIP IN THE DEPARTMENT.

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:39.790
AND LET YOU SOME OF OUR GENERAL

00:37:39.857 --> 00:37:41.258
FUND RESERVES TO TO FIX THE

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:42.693
PROBLEM INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.494
THE WELL.

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:44.629
OF THE BUSINESSES THAT --

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:49.100
SUSTAINER CALIFORNIA.

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.201
SINCE THE DAYS JUST GENERAL

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:51.469
COMMENTS --

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:53.237
AS IT RELATES TO THIS.

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:54.872
I'VE I THINK OUR GOAL TO THE

00:37:54.939 --> 00:37:56.440
EXTENT THAT WE GET TO A PLACE

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.742
WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW THESE

00:37:57.808 --> 00:38:00.378
FEES AS A GENERATED --

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:05.216
AND IS TOO BAD M. MARY.

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:06.684
THE THE ENTITIES GENERATING A

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.152
LOT OF WAYS TO THE MORE YOU

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.487
GENERATE THE MORE TOXIC IT IS

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:10.955
THE MORE YOU PAY.

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:12.957
AS OPPOSED TO AT THE MOMENT THAT

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:15.326
ENTITIES THAT DON'T GENERATE IT

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.261
SEEMS AS FOR MIKE HAS THREE LOOK

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.030
ANY HAZARDOUS WASTE THE PAYING

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:21.432
IN. TO THE FUND SO I THINK AS WE

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:23.267
MOVE FORWARD DOT OUR GOAL IS IS

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:24.735
TO REALLY --

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.370
THE ANYWAY WE GET YOU KNOW A

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:27.838
HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW PEOPLE

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:29.340
LOOK BACK AT TODAY.

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:30.841
DEAD MAN NUMBER ONE QUESTION IS

00:38:30.908 --> 00:38:31.676
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE NOT

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.711
PUTTING YOU TOXIC MATERIAL INTO

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.579
THE GROUND AND SO REDUCING THE

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.248
AMOUNT THAT WE GENERATE.

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:38.749
SHOULD BE OUT OUR NUMBER ONE

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:40.551
GOAL AND ONE OF THE WAYS OF

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:42.053
DOING THAT IS MAKING SURE ALL

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:44.321
THAT THE PEOPLE THAT PRODUCE THE

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:46.323
MOST WASTE PAID THE MOST AMOUNT

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.658
OF MONEY --

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:48.759
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:51.362
EVENTUALLY GET TRANSLATED INTO.

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:55.533
INTO SOME FEE SYSTEM BUT SADLY

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:58.869
THAT'S THE APPROACH I'M AND THE

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.238
HAZARDOUS WASTE ACCOUNT --

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:03.307
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TAKING.

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:06.377
A FEW BITES OF THE SAME PEOPLE

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:09.113
IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND IT IT DOES

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.581
DEFINITELY UP A LOT OF

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:13.551
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFICIENCY IN

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:16.387
THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT --

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:18.622
AVERAGE I WOULD SAY THAT --

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.591
TO ASSEMBLYMAN ASSEMBLY WOMAN

00:39:20.658 --> 00:39:21.959
GARCIA'S PINE --

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:22.927
I THINK IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD TO

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:26.230
DTS SEE TO STAND UP AND SAY.

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:27.465
THIS IS WHAT WE THINK THIS IS

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:28.699
WHY WE HAVE THESE THE ISSUES

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.367
THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:32.403
IN CRISIS MODE AND SO WE NEED TO

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.971
GET TO THE NEXT PLACE WHERE IT

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.573
CAN CLEARLY ARTICULATE THIS IS

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:36.974
WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.576
AND AND PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

00:39:38.642 --> 00:39:40.911
THAT AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:42.179
AND TRUSTED.

00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:44.415
AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT --

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:45.883
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT PARTICULAR

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.251
ACCOUNT --

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:48.719
BUT I CAN'T.

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:49.954
TO WHERE THERE'S AN AGENCY THAT

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.389
SAYS NO WE NEED THIS MONEY TO DO

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:54.625
THIS THING SLIGHTLY IN THE US

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:55.693
EPA CONTEXT --

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.328
WE WOULD FIGHT FOR THOSE BUDGET

00:39:57.394 --> 00:40:00.064
LINES -- AND

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:02.933
PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTOOD AND

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.635
CONGRESS MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:06.237
SPOKE TO UNDERSTOOD THE

00:40:06.303 --> 00:40:07.571
IMPORTANCE OF SUPER FUND

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.306
ALLOCATIONS AND WHERE THAT WENT

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.508
TO AND HOW IT SPED UP THE CLEAN

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.409
UP AND YOU KNOW THE THE THE

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:13.410
OTHER OBVIOUS.

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:15.679
QUESTION IS MORE MONEY SHOULD

DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:54.244
AND AND I WAS --

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:57.948
AT EPA THAT TIME IT'S IT'S NOT.

00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:59.016
IT DOESN'T GIVE DISCRETION TO

00:46:59.082 --> 00:46:59.650
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE IS

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.885
NO THIS IS WHAT THEY LIKE TO DO

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:02.886
IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT THEY NEED

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:03.820
TO DO --

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:06.123
IT'S LEGALLY COMPELLING DOCUMENT

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.225
THAT WE CAN GET COURTS TO HELP

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:09.826
IN FALSE --

00:47:09.893 --> 00:47:11.161
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:12.696
WANT TO PAY.

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:15.299
I'M AND IN MY EXPERIENCE IT

00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:17.034
USEPA -- WE

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:17.968
WILL VERY UNPOPULAR BECAUSE WE

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:19.336
WOULD HOLD OTHER FEDERAL

00:47:19.403 --> 00:47:22.172
AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE --

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:24.908
WE NEED AS A STATE ACCOUNT SHOW

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:26.210
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:27.377
TWO THINGS.

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.912
ONE DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WAS

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:30.280
GONNA DO AND SECOND.

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:33.884
CASE FOR WHAT IT SAYS IS GOING --

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:35.485
TO BUT YOU SAID IT'S IT'S GOING

00:47:35.552 --> 00:47:36.587
TO BE -- A

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:38.689
STRUGGLE BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:40.691
GOVERNMENT --

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:42.659
ISN'T PRIORITIZING THESE KIND OF

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.761
CLEAN UPS AND THEIR GOAL IS IF

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:45.996
YOU HAVE A LESS STRINGENT

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:47.431
CLEANUP STANDARDS.

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:48.432
AND THIS MAKES SENSE TO ALL OF

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:50.834
US YOU PAY LESS TO CLEAN IT UP.

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:51.969
SAID THERE'S A DIRECT

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.470
CORRELATION --

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:55.172
BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.640
PAY AND THE LEVEL OF CLEAN U WE

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:58.175
RECEIVE --

00:47:58.242 --> 00:47:59.977
AND THEN BOEING --

00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:01.612
AS ANOTHER PORTION OF THE SITE

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:04.948
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:06.149
GET HIT TO THEIR OBLIGATIONS

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:09.753
WHICH ALSO LEGALLY BINDING WITH

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.055
US -- SAYS.

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:13.056
ALL THAT REQUIRES LEGAL --

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:15.492
GOAL THAT REQUIRE AS BE PEOPLE

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:16.493
KNOWING YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.528
THE BOTTOM LINE THAT PEOPLE KNOW

00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:20.163
THAT WE ARE IN IT WE ARE SERIOUS

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.632
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO WALK AWAY

00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:22.733
FROM THE PROJECT AND WE'RE NOT

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.034
GOING TO ALLOW OTHERS TO WALK

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:25.469
AWAY FROM THAT COMMITMENTS.

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:27.371
THAT'S HARD TO DO WHEN.

00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:30.674
YOU KNOW T. SENATE --

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:31.975
SENATE DISTANCE COMMENTS --

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:32.876
WHERE IN DISARRAY WE HAVE BEEN

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.878
IN DISARRAY WE WORKING EVERY DAY

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.847
TO MAKE A DECISION TO MOVE THE

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.615
AGENCY BACK INTO HEALTH?

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.550
BACK INTO A PLACE WHERE RUNNING

00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:41.518
PROPERLY --

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:43.754
BUT RETOOLING WORKING OUT THE

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.956
BUDGET IS AND HOLDING VERY LARGE

00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:47.157
SOPHISTICATED POLLUTERS

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:48.458
ACCOUNTABLE IS REALLY DIFFICULT

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:50.060
SO WE NEED TO PUT SOME STUFF

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:52.462
BEHIND US WE NEED TO MOVE PAST

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:54.331
THAT ERA OF DISARRAY.

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:56.033
INTO A HERO ALL OF WE'VE GOT A

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.668
FEW ISSUES THAT WAY SOLVING

00:48:57.734 --> 00:49:00.037
TOGETHER AT THIS IS WHAT THE

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:00.671
THIS IS HOW WE DOING THEM AT THE

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:03.206
SAME CLEAN IT UP --

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:05.776
WE MET WITH FAMILIES THAT LIVE

00:49:05.842 --> 00:49:07.010
AROUND THE SITE --

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:09.246
THIS MIGRATION OFFSITE FROM THAT

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:11.415
FACILITY --

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.917
TO COMMUNITIES AND IT WAS REALLY --

00:49:13.984 --> 00:49:16.086
EMOTIONALLY DEVASTATING.

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:17.721
YES MOMS TALKING ABOUT THE YOUNG

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.623
KIDS THAT HAVE CANCER --

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.694
AND YES IT DOES A VERY REAL AND

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.396
PERSONAL FACE TO ALL THESE SITES

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:28.432
AND WE WE KIND OF KNOW THAT AT

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:29.166
THE SAME TIME.

00:49:29.232 --> 00:49:30.567
WE NEED TO BE RIGOROUS AND

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.235
DISCIPLINED AND DILIGENT IN OUR

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:42.846
APPROACH TO TO SOLVING AT THANKS.

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:43.947

PAYMENT YOUR REAL QUICK --

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:46.917
SO YOU TALK ABOUT THE NINE

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:49.686
THOUSAND SITES THAT ARE --

00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:51.588
I GUESS THE OR FROM SITES WE

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:52.723

THE BEEN?

00:49:55.592 --> 00:49:57.928
CATEGORIZED OF THEIR TOXICITY

00:49:57.994 --> 00:50:00.831
AND RATE AND THEN I'M ASSUMING A

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:02.332
LOT OF THESE OUR BROWN FIELDS IN

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:04.334
AREAS WHERE.

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:04.868
THEY DID KNOW THERE WAS A

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:07.504

HAT TESTIMONY CANNOT TO THAT

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:16.713
QUESTION --

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.014
I WOULD SAY THAT.

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:18.715
MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEM --

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.250
DRY CLEANERS --

OUT OF DRY CLEAN AS WHEN YOU

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:28.592
LOOK AT SUPERFUND SITES --

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:29.726
IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:33.163
THINGS TO CLEAN UP --

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.131

BENEFICIAL ECONOMIC RE USE --

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:39.603
OBVIOUSLY A PRIORITY AND AND WE

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:40.704

AND I I THINK OFTEN WE WERE

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:27.184
AFRAID OF MAKING A DECISION IN

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.685
ANY CONTEXT IN LIFE --

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.454

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:23.639
BECAUSE WE WERE NOT YET CURRENT

MILLION DOLLARS IN H. W. CA.

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:21.497
WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO WHAT WE

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.566
REPORTED LAST JUNE.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.735

COUNT CONSEQUENTIAL ERRORS

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:28.604
HOWEVER ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.039

THE JUNE ENACTMENT GALLEY AND

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.109
THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET ARE

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.744
PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:35.945
EXPENDITURES FOR THE EXITE

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:38.814

PROGRAM COSTS.

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.458
IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:50.726
WHICH LEADS TO ADMINISTRATIVE

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.895
BURDENS ON BOTH DTS SEE AN FEE

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.197

SOME OF THE FEE FEES HAVE A COST

OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT SOME DO NOT.

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:00.269
TOTAL REVENUES ARE DEPENDENT ON

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.814

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.922
IT'S EXPENSIVE TO COLLECT THE

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:20.635
OF SUB THREE BUT I'M ACTUALLY

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:22.270
GONNA FOCUS MOST OF MY COMMENTS

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:23.505
ON THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S THE

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:26.274
NEGATIVE BALANCE THAT TRULY IS

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:28.343
DISTURBING ANY OF US.

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:29.478

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.587
THAT DID NOT HAVE BUDGET

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:39.888
TRANSPARENCY WITH THE

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:42.357

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:43.291
FOR MANY OF US.

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:45.694
A PROBLEM OF TRUST AND FEELING

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.195
LIKE WE CAN LOOK TO THIS

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:48.597

AN INFLECTION POINT RIGHT NOW

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:54.369

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:02.511
MAINTAIN THAT TRANSPARENCY IN

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:04.179
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD.

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.747
IN THAT LIGHT I REALLY WANTED TO

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:10.018
TALK ONCE WOULD HAVE THIS YEAR.

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:12.054

STEP UP AND MEET YOUR NEGATIVE

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:18.460
BALANCE WHICH PROGRAMS ARE WE

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.729

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:23.732
NOT IMPLEMENT AND HOW --

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.834
BESIDES LOOKING TO GENERAL FUND

01:18:25.901 --> 01:18:28.103
WOULD YOU MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:31.073

INCURRING A NEGATIVE SUNDANCE I

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:46.755
WANT TO SAY THAT WILL.

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:47.756
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:49.091

THE NEGATIVE FUND BALANCE

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:09.478
PERTAINS TO THE HAZARDS WAS

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:10.645
CONTROL ACCOUNT.

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:12.414
AND THAT ACCOUNT COVERS ALL OF

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.182
OUR ACTIVITIES THAT IMPLEMENT

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:16.551
THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL LAWS

BALLOTS WILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.437
CUTS TO THOSE PROGRAMS.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.606

TOWARDS DELAYS WITHIN PERMITTING

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:40.742
LEADS TOWARD SOME OF THE

TNC.

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:45.680
IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING.

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:47.782
BUT EVEN IF WE ENTER INTO THE

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:49.651
LARGER DISCUSSION REGARDING FEES

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:51.186
THOSE FEES WOULDN'T BE COLLECTED

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.254
THIS YEAR.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.989
THAT REVENUE WOULDN'T BE

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:55.357
AVAILABLE TO THE NEXT YEAR AND

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:56.458
SO THERE'S A WHOLE THIS YEAR

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:57.859
THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:00.061
BANDAID AND SOME REAL HONESTY

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:02.130
AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THIS

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:04.432
COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:06.168
ENTERTAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:08.603
WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS THAT.

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.005
THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.406
BEING TASKED WITH.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:12.507
SO.

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:15.810
IF IF I CAN HOW DO WE SOLVE THE

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:17.312
PROBLEM THIS YEAR.

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:19.047
HOW DO WE MEET THE NEEDS WITHOUT

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:20.882
GOING TO GENERAL FUND ARE THERE

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:22.150
ANY PLANS THAT YOU CURRENTLY

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:27.289
HAVE?

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:28.690
SO WE WE DO ONLY HAVE THE

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.025
AUTHORITY WE HAVE TO COLLECT THE

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:32.360
FEES THAT WE DO AND SO IT I

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:32.894
THINK.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.629
CHIEF DIRECTOR CHIEF DEPUTY

01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:36.431
DIRECTOR NEGRI ARTICULATED IT

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:37.866
WHICH IS WE WILL HAVE TO CUT.

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.134
ESPECIALLY WITHIN OUR HAZARDOUS

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.835
WASTE PROGRAM AND THAT WOULD

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:41.937
LEAD TO DELAYS AND PERMIT

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:43.572
DECISIONS AND ENFORCEMENT

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:46.007
ACTIVITIES IN CRIMINAL

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:47.776
INVESTIGATIONS.

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:48.877
MAYBE I'LL JUST END WITH THIS

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:50.812
THE LEGISLATURE IS A WILLING

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:53.215

HAVE SOME INPUT INTO.

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.194
PROGRAM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

TO ALLOW THIS DEPARTMENT TO HAVE

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.916

INTENDING TO PRESENT --

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:46.701
THE LEGISLATURE WITH A PLAN.

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.503

THERE HAS BEEN A DEFICIT.

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.339
YET THERE WASN'T THE

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:59.741
TRANSPARENCY IN THE THE REQUEST

THEN WE ARE LEFT IN THE DARK AND

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:22.430
WE ARE LEFT TO ONLY QUESTION

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:24.232
WHAT IS BEING DONE BECAUSE THE

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.234
ANSWERS THAT WE GET SOMETIMES

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.269
DON'T MAKE SENSE --

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:32.841
I I IT IN THIS IS NOT MEANT AS A

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:35.510
AS A CRITICISM PERSONALLY.

01:23:35.577 --> 01:23:36.845
BUT YOU BOTH HAVE BEEN WITH THE

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.380
DEPARTMENT.

SINCE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:48.556
SIXTEEN SINCE DECEMBER OF TWO

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:49.758
THOUSAND THIRTEEN SO THE THE

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.126
THESE ARE ISSUES.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.495
THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR SO LONG

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:54.996
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I WAS

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:56.498
LOOKING AT A BILL THAT I WAS

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:58.299
INTRODUCING REGARDING.

01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:01.236
THE THE PERMIT THE PERMITTING AN

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:03.605
AYE AYE HE WAS GIVING EXTRA TIME

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:06.007
AND WE WERE LOOKING AT THE FACT

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.976
IN -- TWO

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:08.643
THOUSAND FIFTEEN VARMA SEPT

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.844
SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.679
COMMITTEE HIGHLIGHTED TWELVE

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:13.681
FACILITIES THAT WERE OPERATING

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.083
ON PERMITS THAT IT EXPIRED AS

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:20.522
FAR BACK AS NINETEEN NINETY TWO

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:21.122
NINETEEN NINETY TWO THERE ARE

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.790
STILL SOME FACILITIES THAT ARE

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:23.224
OPERATING A PERMITS EXTENDING AS

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.326
FAR BACK AS NINETEEN NINETY SIX

01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:25.660
SO.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.862
THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO ONE HAS

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:32.033
BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND SO WE

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.802
STILL HAVE SOME BETTER OVER TEN

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:35.770
YEARS EXPIRED.

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:37.105
AND THAT MEANS OF THOSE

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:40.041
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:42.343
LIVING AROUND OF THESE TOXIC --

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:45.013
FACILITIES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:47.182
TAKING THIS ALL IN AND WE DO

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:48.550
KNOW THAT IT'S THE DISADVANTAGED

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:50.185
COMMUNITIES AND THE COMMUNITIES

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:53.188
OF COLORS THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED.

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:53.721
FOR THE ONES THAT ARE MOST

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:56.524
AFFECTED.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:25:00.862
MY QUESTION IS WHY HASN'T.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:04.332
MORE PROGRESS BEEN MADE. TO GIVE

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:07.168
A CLEAR MESSAGE. TO THE

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:09.003
LEGISLATURE.

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:10.705
SO THAT WE COULD THEN.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.006
WORK WITH YOU.

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:20.582
WHAT WAS MISSING?

01:25:20.648 --> 01:25:21.883
ALL ALL ALL ALL A DRESSER FROM

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:22.951
THE BUDGET PERSPECTIVE AND THEN

01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:25.620
I'LL DEFER TO TO DOCTOR WILLIAMS

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:27.188
TO ADDRESS --

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:29.324
THE PROGRAMMATIC CAM ASPECT OF

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:30.658
YOUR QUESTION.

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:31.559
AND IN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:32.727
DEFENSIVE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.796
FORM WE HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:37.065
WITH TRANSITIONING INTO FISK OUT.

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:38.900
AND SOME OF THAT IS OUR

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.602
RESPONSIBILITY AND SOME OF THAT

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:42.837
IS THE NATURAL PROCESS THAT

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.405
OCCURS WHEN YOU'RE TRANSITIONING

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:47.008
FROM A WELL KNOWN FISCAL SYSTEM

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:48.610
THAT EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN USING

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:49.577
FOR DECADES.

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.646
INTO ONE THAT DOESN'T OPERATE

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:53.915
AND FUNCTION THE SAME WAY THAT

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.717
THE PRIOR ONE DID AND SO SOME OF

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:57.418
ITS THAT CHANGE MANAGEMENT THAT

01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:58.286
WE STRUGGLED WITH.

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.655
SOME THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:01.756
NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.725
ACCOUNTING PROCESS SEES IN OUR

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.293
ACCOUNTING PROGRAM AND HAVE

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.861
TAKEN STEPS TO ESTABLISH

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:08.429
LEADERSHIP TO DO THAT.

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:12.166
WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE IN THE

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.268
NOW -- THAT

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:15.036
TAKES SOME AMOUNT OF TIME BUT WE

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:16.504
SPENT -- AND

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:17.906
I WANT.

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.073
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.742
FINANCE HAS BEEN OUR PARTNER IN

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:22.644
THIS WE SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:24.012
MONTHS WITH MPLOYEES WORKING

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:26.047
EVERY WEEKEND TO THE HOLIDAYS TO

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:27.115
MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD COME

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:29.050
BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH ACCURATE

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.785
FROM BALANCE NUMBERS BECAUSE WE

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:31.953
KNEW.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:32.887
WE CAN'T START TO HAVE THIS

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:34.822
CONVERSATION INTO WE HAVE A

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:37.892
RECONCILIATION OF ALL OF THOSE --

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:40.862
ACCOUNTING PERIODS AND NUMBERS

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:42.463
AND SO --

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:43.665
YOU KNOW WITH THE CONVERSATION

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.099
DOES START WITH --

01:26:45.166 --> 01:26:47.302
ACCURATE NUMBERS SO THAT WE KNOW

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.637
WHAT SITUATION WE HAVE WITH THE

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.306
REVENUES WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.441
OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW FOR A

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:55.009
STRUCTURE THAT OR THAT EXISTED

01:26:55.076 --> 01:26:56.444
AT THAT TME.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.012
BUT WHICH HAS GROWN AND EVOLVED

01:26:58.079 --> 01:27:00.281
SINCE THEN SO ALL ALL ALL

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.684
DEFERRED A DOCTOR WILLIAMS FOR

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:05.386
ANY PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSE

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:05.687
[inaudible]

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:07.689
SO.

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:08.856
THOSE THAT KNOW ME KNOW THAT MY

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:11.759
FORMER CEO USED TO SAY.

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.428
GOOD NEWS IS NO NEWS.

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:15.129
NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS AND BAD NEWS

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:18.366
IS GOOD NEWS AND I IS HERE TO

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:19.334
THAT I'M HAPPY TO EXPLAIN THAT

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.902
FURTHER IF ANYBODY CARES.

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:23.671
BUT THE IDEA THAT BAD HERE TO IT

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.873
NOW THOUGH YEAH WELL BAD NEWS IS

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.742
GOOD NEWS MEANS THAT THAT MEANS

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.377
COMMUNICATION IS HAPPENING THAT

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:30.445
MEANS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:32.447
REAL PROBLEM IS ON THE TABLE.

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:33.481
THAT MEANS YOU CAN ACTUALLY

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:36.618
ENGAGE IN THE SOLUTIONS IN

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:39.654
FINDING THE SOLUTIONS AND THAT

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.456
HAS BEEN MY MODEL FOR MORE THAN

01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:43.358
A DECADE AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.092
BE MY MODEL.

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:46.794
I ALSO THINK THAT THE SECRETARY

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:48.529
ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THE

01:27:48.596 --> 01:27:51.065
ADMINISTRATION ACROSS THE BOARD

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:52.300
ISM IS.

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:54.202
COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY WANTS

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:56.938
TO HAVE A REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:58.373
THE REAL ISSUES.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:27:59.974
I CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU KNOW ALL OF

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.809
THE REASONS AND ALL THE

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:02.910
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE SHE TO

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:04.412
SHARE INFORMATION IN THE PAST

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:05.747
WHERE.

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.348
I WANT TO GO BACK TO COME WITH A

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:10.385
BELIEVE IT WAS SENATOR ALLEN WHO

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:11.986
SAID THAT OR MAYBE IT WAS LIKE

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:13.087
HAVE SKIS ABOUT BEING A DOCTOR

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:15.523
AND YOU CAN BE A GREAT DOCTOR

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:18.026
BUT YOU'RE NOT AN ACCOUNTANT.

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:18.660
I GOT TO TELL YOU FROM DOCTOR

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:19.961
AND I'M RUNNING A BUSINESS AND

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:21.496
MY NUMBERS AREN'T MATCHING AND

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:22.630
I'M NOT TAKING HOME SALARY I'M

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:23.865
GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHO I HIGHER

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:25.266
TO MAKE SURE THEY TAKE CARE OF

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:26.567
THE NUMBERS.

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:27.301
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE EXPERTS IN

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:28.936
EVERYTHING AND THAT'S WHY YOU

01:28:29.003 --> 01:28:31.372
HAVE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS.

01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:33.241
AND THAT'S FOR ME THE MOST

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:36.844
IMPORTANT THING THAT AND IS.

01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:38.513
IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT I

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:39.947
REALLY TO WANT TO HEAR THE

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:40.782
ANSWER.

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:42.750
IS THERE A SENSE OF URGENCY IN

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:47.121
ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM.

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:49.424
IF YOU CENTERS RHETORICAL BUT

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.558
THAT.

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.459
IT YES.

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:53.294
YES AGAIN EVERY DAY WERE ENGAGED

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:54.629
WITH THE SECRETARY EVERY SINGLE

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.864
DAY.

01:28:56.931 --> 01:28:59.701
ALL RIGHT WE WE WILL CLEARLY BE

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:01.769
A BE ON THIS BECAUSE IT IS SO

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:02.904
IMPORTANT.

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.572
AND YOU KNOW MIGHT MY COLLEAGUE

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:06.107
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND SHE'S

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.442
LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:09.811

01:29:09.877 --> 01:29:11.379
BUT I DO THINK YOU I I I THANK

01:29:13.114 --> 01:29:14.348
YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE.

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:15.783
A WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.619
WE REALLY ARE I AM LOOKING

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:19.253

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:24.726
DOCTOR QUIRK FOLLOWED BY --

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:28.196
MS GARCIA AND MISTER ALLEN.

01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:29.764
WELL THANK YOU FOR THE BAD NEWS --

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:30.598
I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:33.601
COMING FORWARD AND DISCLOSING

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.203
ALL OF THIS INFORMATION.

01:29:35.269 --> 01:29:37.538
I ALSO WANT TO SAY WE WE CANNOT

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:39.240
AFFORD TO MAKE CUTS.

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.075
IN THE YOUR PERSONNEL THAT

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:44.445
THINGS ARE --

01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:46.280
ASUS LEVEL ALREADY --

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:50.218
AND I AGREE WITH THAT CHAIR --

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:54.155
BLOOM THAT WE NEED --

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.923
TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR BUDGET AS

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.291
QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO PREVENT

01:29:57.358 --> 01:29:58.526
CUTS.

01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:01.395
AND HOPEFULLY TO GET TO THE

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:02.597
RESOURCES YOU NEED SO YOU DON'T

01:30:02.663 --> 01:30:03.831
HAVE --

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:06.367
PERMITS THAT GO TWENTY YEARS IF

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:08.436
THE RESOURCES ARE REALLY ONE OF

01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:09.837
THE REASONS.

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.172
ARE THERE OTHER REASONS THAT

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:14.575
PERMITS CAN TAKE TWENTY YEARS.

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:17.178
SO I THINK THAT ACROSS THE BOARD

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.646
IN THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:21.048
CHALLENGES MAKING DECISIONS --

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:22.350
THERE ARE TOUGH DECISIONS TO BE

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:24.418
MADE THEY NEED TO BE MADE THEY

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:25.820
NEED TO BE DONE IN A TIMELY

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:27.188
FASHION THEY NEED TO BE MADE

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:30.224
BASED ON STE ON SOUND SCIENCE.

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:32.393
AND IT TAKES INTESTINAL

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.394
FORTITUDE TO MAKE THOSE

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:35.396
DECISIONS IN A TIMELY FASHION

01:30:35.463 --> 01:30:37.799
AND THAT'S PROBABLY OUR BIGGEST

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:40.001
OPPORTUNITY IS JUST TO GET TO

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:41.369
THE DECISION POINT.

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:43.104
SOME OF THAT WILL HAPPEN THROUGH

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:45.640
OUR NEW VIOLATIONS SCORING.

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:47.742
PROCEDURES WHICH REALLY --

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:51.412
PROVIDE SOME CONSISTENCY AROUND

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:53.481
WHAT WE'RE WHAT CONSTITUTES A

01:30:53.548 --> 01:30:55.349
VIOLATION THAT WOULD HAVE AN

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:57.318
IMPACT ON HOW WE WHERE PERMIT

01:30:57.385 --> 01:30:58.352
DECISION I THINK THAT WILL

01:30:58.419 --> 01:30:59.821
ACTUALLY HELP US.

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:00.922
GET TO THOSE DECISIONS IN A

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:03.825
CONSISTENT WAY M..

01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:05.660
OF ACTIVELY BUT WE ALSO HAVE

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:07.662
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES JUST TO TO

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:09.964
GET TO THAT DECISION POINT --

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.966
QUICKLY SO THAT'S PROBABLY THE

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:13.334
NUMBER ONE THING I THINK WE CAN

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:14.669
DO ACROSS THE BOARD --

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.637
ARE THESE DECISIONS BEING HELD

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:18.239
UP BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.341
ABOUT SUITS AND SO THEY WANT TO

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:25.146
MAKE THINGS PERFECT.

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:26.480
I THINK.

01:31:26.547 --> 01:31:27.949
I THINK THAT BIG LEGAL CALCULUS

01:31:28.015 --> 01:31:31.652
ALWAYS GOES INTO THINGS BUT WE

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:34.088
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES GET SUED.

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.057
IT'S THE NATURE OF THE BEAST.

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:39.927
AND THAT'S LET US KNOW IF THERE

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:42.530
IS A WAY WE CAN HELP YOU.

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:44.832
AND I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD TO THAT

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:47.702
WE ALSO HAD BUSINESS PROCESS.

01:31:47.768 --> 01:31:50.371
AND THE PERMIT DECISION.

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.573
STRUCTURE THAT WERE ANTIQUATED

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.242
AND THAT HAD NEEDED UPDATING AND

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:56.244
AS THE SECRETARY NDICATED HE'S

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:57.645
BIG ON LEAN.

01:31:57.712 --> 01:32:00.348
MANY OF OUR PROJECTS RELATE TO

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:02.817
THE PERMITTING PROCESS ARE LEAN

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.185
SIX SIGMA PROJECTS RELATE TO THE

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.419
PERMITTING PROCESS AND WE'VE

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:06.654
SEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:08.389
IMPROVEMENTS --

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:10.424
IN THE PILOTING OF NEW PROCESSES

01:32:10.491 --> 01:32:11.926
THAT WERE CURRENTLY UPDATING

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:14.095
WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN --

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:16.030
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN TIME

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:17.598
FRAMES FOR DECISION MAKING

01:32:17.665 --> 01:32:19.600
PROCESS THE DECISION MAKING A

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.535
PERMANENT ALONG WITH --

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:23.604
VIOLATIONS GREEN PROCEDURE THAT

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:26.774

STARTED MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:57.898
YET.

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.200
SO THAT THEIR TWO PIECE OF THAT

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:01.335
I THINK --

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:01.969
ONE WOULD BE OUR COST RECOVERY

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:03.537
EFFORTS AND THE OTHER WOULD BE

01:34:03.604 --> 01:34:05.940
OUR FEE FOR SERVICE WORK --

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:08.009
AND FOR SMALL COST RECOVERY WE

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:09.744
LEARNED A LOT WE'VE CHANGED OUR

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:12.046
PROCEDURES AND WE NOW WILL AGAIN

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:13.047
IT'S ABOUT DECISION MAKING

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:14.682
MAKING A DECISION MUCH MORE

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:16.417
QUICKLY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.085
IT'S EVEN WORTH PURSUING.

01:34:18.152 --> 01:34:19.387
IF THE IF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY

01:34:19.453 --> 01:34:21.789
ISN'T THERE IN THIS THE AMOUNT

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:23.190
OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE THE

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:24.358
POTENTIAL TO RECOVER.

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:25.793
ISN'T WORTH THE EFFORT WE ARE

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.261
GOING TO PUT THE EFFORT INTO IT

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:28.929
WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES.

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:30.464
SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO PURSUE

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.832
THAT BUT WE DID.

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.801
OVERHAUL OUR COST RECOVERY

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:34.635
PROCEDURES AND THOSE ARE BEEN IN

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:37.004

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:40.274

THEN MAYBE CLARIFY MY COMMENT --

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:37.931
I'M I WASN'T REFERRING --

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:39.867
TO THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT

01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:41.468
ARE NECESSARY.

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:43.203
TO COLLECT COST RECOVERY WHICH

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:44.972
IS -- A

01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:47.808
REVENUE ELEMENT OF BOTH H. W. CA

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:50.344
AND TOSCA AND WHICH IS A

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:51.612
VOLATILE.

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:54.782
REVENUE SOURCE WHICH CONTRIBUTES

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:56.517
TO SUPPORTIVE OF THE COST OF THE

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.786
PROGRAMS I WAS REFERRING TO THE

01:40:58.852 --> 01:41:00.854
COLLECTION OF THE ESTABLISHED

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:02.523
FEES THE DISPOSAL FEE THE

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:03.757
GENERATOR FEE.

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:05.859
AND AND THE SECRETARY REFERENCE

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.494
AT SOME OF THESE FEES ARE --

01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:09.430
WE HAVE MULTIPLE FEES THAT HIT

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:10.864
THE SAME FEE PAYER AND THEY'RE

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.733
CONFUSING TO THE FEE PAYERS AND

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.101
THOSE WITH THE FEES THAT I WAS

01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:15.869
REFERRING TO THAT CD TFA

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:16.737
COLLECTS.

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:17.971
COST RECOVERY IS WHAT THE

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:19.706
DEPARTMENT BILLS DIRECTLY TO

01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:21.542
RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THAT'S

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:23.977
AS YOU WERE FOR HER CAN RESULT

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:26.380
IN DELAYS IN PAYMENTS AND

01:41:26.447 --> 01:41:28.182
LITIGATION WHEN THERE'S A

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:30.184
RESISTANCE --

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:32.119
TO REIMBURSING THE DEPARTMENT

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:33.220
FOR OUR ARE BILLED AMOUNTS AND

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:34.988
THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S A

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:36.490
LITTLE MORE VOLATILE BECAUSE

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:38.091
SOMETIMES WE WON'T RECEIVED --

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:39.993
THE PAYMENT --

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.595
IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT WE AND

01:41:41.662 --> 01:41:43.397
BUILD IT OR WE MAY GET INTO

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:45.165
LITIGATION TO COLLECT THOSE

01:41:45.232 --> 01:41:47.000
COSTS SO I I THINK.

01:41:47.067 --> 01:41:48.936
THERE'S THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT.

01:41:49.002 --> 01:41:49.970
PARTS OF FEES WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:52.172
IN TERMS OF THE EXPENSE TO

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:54.241
COLLECT AND CD HERE PHASE WORK

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:56.477
IS NOT IS RELATIVELY ROUTINE

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:56.844
RIGHT.

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:58.445
IT'S NOT EXCEPTIONAL THEY'RE NOT

01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:00.948
HAVING TO GO OUT AND DO A LOT OF

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:02.249
ENFORCEMENT AND FOLLOW UP ON

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:04.451
FEES THESE ARE THE NORMAL BREAD

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:05.652
AND BUTTER FEES THE OKAY SO BUT

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:07.421
BUT ARE THEY IS THERE SOMETHING

01:42:07.488 --> 01:42:08.021
ABOUT.

01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:12.025
YOUR INDUSTRY.

01:42:12.092 --> 01:42:12.459
THAT.

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:14.294
LEADS TO A HIGHER FEE COLLECTION

01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:14.862
STRUCTURE OR IS THIS WHAT

01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:16.196
THEY'RE CHARGING ALL OF THE

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:18.131
AGENCIES.

01:42:18.198 --> 01:42:21.101
THAT THEY DO THIS WORK WITH.

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:22.870
SO WHEN WE DO THAT COST BENEFIT

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:25.772
ANALYSIS THAT'S A KEY QUESTION

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:28.375
FOR US OKAY OKAY WHAT WHY.

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:29.510
SO I'M INTERESTED IN THAT AND

01:42:29.576 --> 01:42:31.044
I'M ALSO INTERESTED --

01:42:31.111 --> 01:42:32.145
SO TO BE VERY JIM TO SEE THIS

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:33.313
DIFFERENTIATION.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:36.316
MAYBE IT HAS TO DO WITH --

01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:37.518
JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:39.219
AND THERE'S ASPECTS OF THAT THAT

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:40.487
WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WILL

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:42.289
BE INTERESTING TO SEE.

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:43.590
IF THERE'S A FAX FOR COSTS

01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:45.759
ASSOCIATED WITH GOING AFTER

01:42:45.826 --> 01:42:46.960
PHOBIA WITH GETTING.

01:42:47.027 --> 01:42:50.531
FEES FROM THE FROM THE TOXICS.

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:51.999
AREA RATHER THAN FROM.

01:42:52.065 --> 01:42:54.868
OTHER AREAS OF STATE REGULATION --

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:56.770
ON THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FAA

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:58.605
THAT THE OTHER THING I LOVE.

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.173
TO KIND OF LEARN MORE ABOUT IS

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.341
AS YOU GET.

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:03.677
DEEPER INTO THIS ANALYSIS ARE

01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:07.114
OBVIOUSLY WANT TO PROVIDE

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:08.582
EVERYONE TO PROCESS AND AND

01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:09.850

APPROPRIATELY THAT THAT'S

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.224
VITALLY IMPORTANT --

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:19.059

01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:39.513
THAT.

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:43.216
THIS IS AN INTERESTING GOT TOPIC

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:44.751
BECAUSE A YEAR ESSENTIALLY IN

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:47.821
THE POSITION OF BEING OUT.

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:49.456
ONE STATE AGENCY.

01:43:49.523 --> 01:43:52.559
ASKING ANOTHER WHY A CHARGING

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:54.261
SO MUCH HA AND SIX MILLION

01:43:54.328 --> 01:43:55.862
DOLLARS --

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:56.563
ISN'T --

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:58.699
ISN'T CHICKEN FEED --

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:02.836
BUT DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.871
CONDUCT --

01:44:04.938 --> 01:44:07.808
WHAT AMOUNTS TO A THIS IS A?

01:44:07.874 --> 01:44:09.276
SEEMS LIKE IT IT DEMANDS KIND OF

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:10.577
AN AUDIT WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:44:10.644 --> 01:44:12.379
LOOKING --

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.814
INTO THE PROCESSES OF THE OTHER

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.583
AGENCY AND UNDERSTANDING HOW IT

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:19.553
COMES TO PASS THAT THEY CHARGED

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:20.787
THE THESE.

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:23.957
SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.592
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:26.660
AT WHAT.

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:27.995
YOU KNOW WHAT FUNCTIONALITY WE

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:29.363
NEED WITHIN OUR OWN SYSTEM

01:44:29.429 --> 01:44:30.764
BEFORE ALREADY COLLECTING SOME

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:32.399
FEES.

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:34.101
THEN WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO WE

01:44:34.167 --> 01:44:35.802
NEED A LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IT IN

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:38.372
STATUTE THAT WE USE --

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:39.406
FORMALLY BE --

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:40.941
YOU KNOW CITY TFA TO COLLECT

01:44:41.008 --> 01:44:42.042
THOSE FEES --

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.076
DO WE NEED A LEDGE PROPOSAL TO

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:44.845
BE AND WHAT WOULD THE COST TO

01:44:44.911 --> 01:44:46.213
THE DEPARTMENT BE TO COLLECT THE

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:48.015
CITY'S OURSELVES AND HOW WOULD

01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:49.316
THAT BE THAT D USE THAT THE

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:51.018
BURDEN THAT STRUCTURALLY WHAT

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:53.620
YOU WOULD NEED TO DO IN ORDER --

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.022
TO CHANGE --

01:44:55.088 --> 01:44:56.289
YOUR MECHANISM IF THAT'S

01:44:56.356 --> 01:44:58.458
INDICATED THE QUESTION I HAVE

01:44:58.525 --> 01:44:59.960
GETS MORE AT WHETHER IT'S

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:02.596
ACTUALLY INDICATED OR NOT AND

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:04.031
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT

01:45:04.097 --> 01:45:06.066
KIND OF PEELING BACK THE LAYERS

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:07.601
OF THE ONION AND LOOKING.

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:10.070
CLOSELY AT HOW THE FEES ARE

CHARGE CITY SKI TSA.

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:19.546
SO I THINK THAT WILL BE PART OF

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:21.581
THE ANALYSIS IS JUST ASKING CD

01:45:21.648 --> 01:45:22.582
TFA FOR COST BREAKDOWN OF THEIR

01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:24.451

APPROPRIATENESS AND FAIRNESS AND

I I HOPE AND I DON'T MEAN.

01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:31.391
TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON THE OTHER

01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:34.127
AGENCY BUT I I HOPE THAT IT WILL

01:45:34.194 --> 01:45:38.298
BE A CRITICAL ANALYSIS.

01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:39.166

THIS TRANSPARENCY AND

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.521
ACCOUNTABILITY IS OBVIOUSLY

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:02.589
CRUCIAL.

01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:00.280

NOW THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE ALL

01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:29.843
VERY SEPARATE AND DISTINCT.

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:31.611
BUT IT MAKES THE WHOLE STRUCTURE

01:47:31.678 --> 01:47:34.381
OF BIT CONFUSING AND SO --

01:47:34.447 --> 01:47:35.482
WE WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER WITH

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:37.284
THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A LOOK

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:39.519

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:19.492
BUT AGAIN AS WE LOOK AT PUTTING

01:48:19.559 --> 01:48:20.994
MORE MONEY AND I THINK IT'S

01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:22.562
IMPORTANT THAT WE INSURE THAT

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:23.763
THAT WAS CONSTANT COMMUNICATION

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:24.664
THAT THIS ISN'T BROUGHT UP WHEN

01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:25.765

BUT THAT WE UNDERSTAND ON AN

01:48:28.034 --> 01:48:29.202
ONGOING BASIS WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:31.805

WHAT ARE THE SUFFICIENT

01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:55.962
RESOURCES AND THE REASON I ASK

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:56.229
IS THAT?

01:48:56.296 --> 01:48:57.764
WE'VE JUST HAD A LONG

01:48:57.831 --> 01:48:59.132
CONVERSATION REGARDING THE

01:48:59.199 --> 01:49:00.634
POTENTIAL SHUFFLING THE FUNDS TO

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:03.803
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES.

01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:06.439
I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT.

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:08.174
IN THREE YEARS WILL BE BACK HERE

01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:10.443
AND WE'LL BE TOLD THE REASON WE

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:11.011
DIDN'T DO IT IS BECAUSE WE

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:14.547
DIDN'T HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES.

01:49:14.614 --> 01:49:16.216
IS THERE A PLAN THAT IS BEING

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:18.251
PUT TOGETHER.

01:49:18.318 --> 01:49:19.319
WHEN WILL THAT PLAN I I KNOW

01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:21.054
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE AUDIT WE

01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:22.656

01:49:22.722 --> 01:49:23.924
IS THERE A PLAN BEING PUT

01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:26.660
TOGETHER THAT IS GOING.

01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:28.995
TO TAKE US FROM POINT A TO POINT

01:49:29.062 --> 01:49:31.865
B. THAT YOU ARE.

01:49:31.932 --> 01:49:34.834
SO THE NEWS DEPARTMENT CAN WORK

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:36.736
IN A MORE PROGRAMMATIC --

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:38.838
WAY -- THAT

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:40.473
IS THAT IS.

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:42.442
THE TAKES CARE BUSINESS AND IN

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:44.444
THE MORE FISCAL WAY --

01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:47.981
THAT ALLOWS YOU --

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:48.581
TO COLLECT THE FEES THAT YOU

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:50.717
NEED TO COLLECT BUT TO BE ABLE

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:52.185
TO BE A SUCCESSFUL --

01:49:52.252 --> 01:49:54.054
DEPARTMENT BECAUSE AS I THINK

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.522
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:57.190
IT'S THE CALIFORNIANS WERE GOING

01:49:57.257 --> 01:49:58.892
TO SUFFER FROM.

01:49:58.959 --> 01:50:00.327
THE WORK THAT IS BEING THAT IS

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:02.395
NOT BEING DONE --

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:05.699
AND I THE THE I'M NOT SAYING

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:08.668
IT'S FINGER POINTING --

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:09.970
AND EAT THE THAT IT WAS A GOING

01:50:10.036 --> 01:50:13.773
BACK TO THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE.

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:16.443
AND I I ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:17.110
HAS JUST TALKED ABOUT.

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:17.844
WE DON'T HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY

01:50:17.911 --> 01:50:19.746
WE DON'T HAVE THE TRUST AND YET

01:50:19.813 --> 01:50:21.214
THERE'S A COMMENT ABOUT HAVING

01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:23.450
MORE FUNDS PROVIDED TO YOU SO

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:24.784
YOU CAN DO YOUR JOB.

01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:26.319
THEN THE QUESTION IS.

01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:27.721
WHY WEREN'T WE TOLD ABOUT THIS

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:29.689
BEFORE WHAT'S THE PLAN ON HOW

01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:31.224
THIS IS GOING TO BE SPENT?

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:34.027
UP HOW WOULD WE TAKE CARE OF NOW

01:50:34.094 --> 01:50:35.261
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:50:35.328 --> 01:50:36.329
PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE.

01:50:36.396 --> 01:50:41.134
AND I'D LIKE TO END WITH JUST.

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:43.336

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:45.538
THE H. W. CA.

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:47.507
A SHORT FORM --

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:49.175
WE UNDERSTAND THAT'S IT THAT

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:50.810
FUND IS MORE URGENT.

01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:53.580

A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS INGRID

01:58:34.907 --> 01:58:35.475
RESTAURANT I'M WITH THE CENTER

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:36.943
ON RACE POVERTY IN THE

01:58:37.009 --> 01:58:38.144
ENVIRONMENT.

01:58:38.211 --> 01:58:39.245
AND I BEEN WORKING ON THE TNC

01:58:39.312 --> 01:58:40.947
ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:42.715
SPECIFICALLY WITH AN EYE TOWARD

01:58:42.782 --> 01:58:43.483
RESIDENTS.

01:58:43.549 --> 01:58:44.684
WHO LIVE NEAR HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:46.752
FACILITIES AND RESIDENTS WHO

01:58:46.819 --> 01:58:48.754
LIVE NEAR CLEAN UP SITES --

01:58:48.821 --> 01:58:51.424
I HAD HEARD A LOT ABOUT SOME OF

01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:54.994
THESE FISCAL ISSUES BEFORE.

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:56.329
BUT I THINK IT CAME.

01:58:56.395 --> 01:58:58.331
IT CAME CLOSER TO HOME WHEN I

01:58:58.397 --> 01:58:59.999
HEARD ABOUT PROGRAM CUTS.

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:03.703
AND I WANT TO REITERATE FOR THIS

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:07.640
BOARD THAT ANY CUTS TO PROGRAMS

01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:09.542
THAT PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:59:09.609 --> 01:59:10.810
WILL NOT RESULT IN OLD MCAT COST

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:14.146
SAVINGS IT'LL MERELY.

01:59:14.213 --> 01:59:15.281
SHIFTED THOSE COST BURDENS TO

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:16.249
RESIDENTS WHO ARE DIRECTLY

01:59:16.315 --> 01:59:17.950
IMPACTED IN TERMS OF HIGHER

01:59:18.017 --> 01:59:19.752
HEALTHCARE COSTS --

01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:22.488
HIGHER SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM LOWER

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:24.290
PRODUCTIVITY.

01:59:24.357 --> 01:59:26.259
AND AS A STATE WE SUBSCRIBE TO

01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:28.394
THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLES.

01:59:28.461 --> 01:59:31.497
AND WE MUST LOOK AT FEE REFORM

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:33.633
IN A WAY THAT ULTIMATELY REDUCES

01:59:33.699 --> 01:59:35.568
THE GENERATION OF HAZARDOUS

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:37.503
WASTE AND ENSURES THAT THOSE

01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:38.871
THAT ARE PROFITING FROM THE

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:41.707
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT ARE

01:59:41.774 --> 01:59:42.208
THE ONES THAT --

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:46.445
ALTERNATELY COVERING FULLY.

01:59:46.512 --> 01:59:47.580
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:50.182
LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE.

01:59:50.249 --> 01:59:52.151
CONTINUING TO THROW MONEY AT

01:59:52.218 --> 01:59:55.821
THIS AGENCY YEAR AFTER YEAR TO

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:57.557
TO CLOSE THOSE LOOP.

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:59.292
SHORTFALLS.

01:59:59.358 --> 02:00:00.159
IF.

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:02.595
THE LEGISLATURE DOES BAILOUT DTS

02:00:02.662 --> 02:00:05.298
SEE AGAIN THIS YEAR IT MUST TO

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:07.066
DO SO WITH STRINGS ATTACHED.

02:00:07.133 --> 02:00:10.069
IT MUST CREATE AN OVER A STRONG

02:00:10.136 --> 02:00:12.638
IN PERMANENT OVERSIGHT BODY AND

02:00:12.705 --> 02:00:15.841
STRONG CONCRETE BENCHMARKS THAT

02:00:15.908 --> 02:00:17.443
WE CAN THAT ARE MEASURABLE AND

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:19.045
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE

02:00:19.111 --> 02:00:20.313
THAT THE DETAILS HE'S MAKING

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:21.480
MOVEMENTS IN THE RIGHT

02:00:21.547 --> 02:00:22.315
DIRECTIONS.

02:00:22.381 --> 02:00:24.483
AND IF THESE BENCHMARKS CONTINUE

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:26.085
NOT TO BE MET WE HAVE TO HAVE

02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:28.054
REAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:29.789
FUTURE OF THIS AGENCY AND THE

02:00:37.296 --> 02:00:40.099
PREVENTION AND HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:40.366
REDUCTION.

02:01:01.354 --> 02:01:03.656
HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THAT IS NOT.

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:05.391
THE CASE THEY ARE NOT HAZARDOUS

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:07.493
WASTE THERE IS ONE COMPANY IN

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:10.930
THE INDUSTRY OUT OF THOUSANDS OF-MANUFACTURERS.

02:01:10.997 --> 02:01:13.165
THAT DOES HAVE HAZARDOUS WASTE

02:01:13.232 --> 02:01:14.567
IN THEIR SOLAR PANELS AND IN

02:01:14.634 --> 02:01:16.135
HOUSE THEY DEAL WITH THEM AND

02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:18.504
RECYCLE THEM IN A PROPER MANNER

02:01:18.571 --> 02:01:19.972
KEEPING THEM OUT OF LANDFILLS.

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:22.775

02:01:24.777 --> 02:01:27.213
INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA HAS

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:28.114
BECOME FRIGHTENED.

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.483

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:31.651
PANELS.

02:01:31.717 --> 02:01:33.386
AND THEY HAVE BEEN FILLING UP IN

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:35.955
PLACES LIKE UNDER BRIDGES WHERE

02:01:36.022 --> 02:01:37.690
HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVE THEY HAVE

02:01:37.757 --> 02:01:39.725
BEEN FOUND IN.

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:43.529
A SORT STORAGE FACILITIES ALLEN

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:45.431
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:47.066
AS GOING TO TARNISH THE

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:50.970
REPRESENTS THE SEPARATIST BUT

02:01:51.037 --> 02:01:54.607

LANDFILLS.

02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:02.181
BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED

02:02:02.248 --> 02:02:04.316
HAZARDOUS WASTE IN CALIFORNIA

02:02:04.383 --> 02:02:05.251
AND THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE

02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:07.286
WRITTEN THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:09.655
STORED FOR THIRTY DAYS.

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.590
IT WITH THE CAN'T BE RECYCLED IN

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:13.159
CALIFORNIA.

02:02:13.225 --> 02:02:14.326
THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.102
REALLY RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC OF

HAVE CREATED A LOSS IN THAT

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:43.823
THERE HAS TO BE RECYCLING.

POVERTY IN ENVIRONMENTS.

02:13:51.256 --> 02:13:53.291
AND ALSO SAY THAT WE NEED TO

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:55.994
LOOK AT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF

02:13:56.061 --> 02:13:57.596
TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT ARE

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:59.197
GENERATED.

02:13:59.264 --> 02:14:00.599
THAT THEN BECOME THE HAZARDOUS

02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:03.001
WASTE AND SO IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:14:03.068 --> 02:14:04.269
THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE

02:14:04.336 --> 02:14:06.371
NOT CUTS. TO THE SIGNATURE

02:14:06.438 --> 02:14:06.938
PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:10.842
TALK TROLL THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

ACT ON THE SAFER CONSUMER

02:14:13.044 --> 02:14:15.046
PRODUCTS PROGRAM BECAUSE THAT IS

02:14:15.113 --> 02:14:16.815
AT LEAST A START AT TRYING TO

02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:19.017
REDUCE THE TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT

02:14:19.084 --> 02:14:21.853
GET INTO PRODUCTS THAT END UP IN.

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:24.055
THE BATTERIES AND THE BRAKE PADS

AND OTHER ITEMS [inaudible]

02:14:25.357 --> 02:14:28.627
BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE BUDGET

02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:30.128
DEFICIT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

02:14:30.195 --> 02:14:31.997
TO BE URGENTLY ADDRESSED.

02:14:32.063 --> 02:14:33.265
AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS

02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:34.900
ALREADY GOING ON FOR FIVE YEARS

02:14:34.966 --> 02:14:36.334
DURING THAT TIME WHERE THERE WAS

02:14:36.401 --> 02:14:37.569
A TRANSITION TO AN ACCOUNTING

02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:39.671
SYSTEM IS.

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:42.674
A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THE NEED FOR

02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:44.342
MORE CAREFUL MORE CONTINUOUS A

02:14:44.409 --> 02:14:46.511
MORE REGULAR OVERSIGHT OF THE

02:14:46.578 --> 02:14:47.612
DTS CITY.

02:14:47.679 --> 02:14:49.281
SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE

02:14:49.347 --> 02:14:51.716
REFORMS THAT THE NEWS SECRETARY

02:14:51.783 --> 02:14:55.720
WANTS TO BRING ABOUT --

02:14:55.787 --> 02:14:57.055
THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION

02:14:57.122 --> 02:14:59.057
PARTNERS ADVOCATES THAT THERE IS

02:14:59.124 --> 02:15:03.628
A BODY THAT REGULARLY AND MORE

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:05.797
IN DEPTH DIGS INTO THE

02:15:05.864 --> 02:15:08.300
MANAGEMENT OF THE DTS SEE AN

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:10.502
IT'S FISCAL SITUATION.

WE SUPPORT THE POLLUTER PAYS

02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:13.338
PRINCIPLE.

02:15:13.405 --> 02:15:15.974
AND THINK THAT.

02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:18.643
IF COST RECOVERY IS ONLY

02:15:18.710 --> 02:15:20.378
STARTING TO HAPPEN NOW AND IS

02:15:20.445 --> 02:15:22.481
NOT RETROACTIVE TO A LOT OF

02:15:22.547 --> 02:15:23.181
COMPANIES THAT HAVE INCURRED

02:15:23.248 --> 02:15:25.684
THESE STEPS WE WILL NOT BE

02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:26.251
SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSING THE

THAT I THINK WE'LL.

02:15:42.267 --> 02:15:44.603
SEE WHERE WE STAND THREE YEARS

02:15:44.669 --> 02:15:45.837
