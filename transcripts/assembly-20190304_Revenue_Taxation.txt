A FIVE TWENTY MIND A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN -- IS A FEDERALLY TAX ADVANTAGED SAVINGS PLAN DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO SAVE FOR FUTURE EDUCATION COSTS CALIFORNIA EXAMS. COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT EARNINGS FROM TAXES OF FUNDS ARE WITHDRAWN FOR QUALIFIED HIGHER EDUCATION EXPENSES BUT NO INCENTIVE IS PROVIDED FOR PRO ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING SAVING IN A FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY SEVEN STATES. WITH THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX THAT DOES NOT OFFER A TAX INCENTIVE FOR SAVING WITH A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. IN A RECENT STATEWIDE SURVEY FIFTY FOR HIS ANSWERED A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS. IN TODAY'S ECONOMY MAKES SENSE YET AT OUR CURRENT TRAJECTORY CALIFORNIA WILL FALL OVER ONE MILLION DEGREE SHORT OF DEMAND. IN TWENTY THIRTY ONE OF THE GREATEST HURDLE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES FACE WHEN CONTEMPLATING WHETHER TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION IS A SKYROCKETING BROUGHT ROCKETING COST OF ATTENDANCE THE LEGISLATURE. MUST TAKE EVERY STEP POSSIBLE TO ENSURE COLLEGE SAVINGS. A IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF EVERY FAMILIES MINE THIS BILL DOES THIS BY PROVIDING A TAX DEDUCTION FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO A SCHOLAR SHARE FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT. WITH A LIMIT OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SINGLE FILERS AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THOSE WHO FILE JOINTLY. SUPPORTING STUDENTS CALLS JOURNEY IS THE GREATEST INVESTMENT OUR STATE CAN MAKE IN LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY AND SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH. ADDITIONALLY ACCORDING TO A SURVEY BY THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AT ST LOUIS KIDS WITH COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ARE ALMOST SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO ATTEND COLLEGE THAN THOSE WITHOUT. AND HAVING A SAVINGS ACCOUNT WAS A BETTER PREDICTOR OF COLLEGE ATTENDANCE THAN RACE OR INCOME LEVEL THIS DEDUCTION SIGNALS ARE STATES PRIORITY IN PROVIDING A MEANINGFUL INCENTIVE FOR FAMILIES TO INVEST IN A CHILD HIGHER EDUCATION. DREAMS AND ULTIMATELY CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY I EXPERIENCE THIS WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE -- MY BEST FRIEND WHO WAS A ROOMMATE ROOMMATE WITH HE HAD A SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT HIS PARENTS A SET UP FOR HIM. I WASN'T ABLE TO DO THAT I WORK THREE DIFFERENT JOBS WHILE ALSO GOING TO SCHOOL FULL TIME THERE WAS JUST A MAJOR DIFFERENCE AND NOT NECESSARILY ACADEMIC ACTIVITY BUT IN ACTUAL CURRICULAR STUFF AND BEING ABLE TO FULLY UTILIZE THE ABILITY. TO BE A FULL TIME STUDENT WHILE ATTENDING COLLEGE -- AND I THINK THAT HE WAS FAR BETTER OFFER HAVE THEY ARE LEVEL SINGLE YEAR AND SINCE THE SIX I'VE BEEN HERE -- BUT UNTIL WE CAN GET TO A LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR COST OF COLLEGES MORE AFFORDABLE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MORE TOOLS FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE ACCESS. TO FUNDS TO HELP THEM SAVE FOR COLLEGE BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO INCENTIVIZE IT AND THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THIS THAT THAT'S WHAT. THIS BILL DOES AND IT IS A DATE DEDUCTION WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN A TAX INCENTIVE WHICH PREVIOUS MEASURES HAD -- HAD SOUGHT AND AND I AND I NOTE THAT IN THE NOW SAYS THERE WERE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE KID A MINUTE COMMITTEE WAS MAKING IN TERMS OF ADDING A SUNSET -- AS WELL AS SOMETHING ELSE AT THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN'T REMEMBER -- MAYBE CAN AFFORD REAR THE RETROACTIVITY SO I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY. TO HEAVILY CONSIDER THOSE AND MAKE AMENDMENTS WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE BUT WITH ME TODAY. I HAVE CALIFORNIA'S A TREASURE FROM FEELING A MALL AS WELL AS LINDA ENGLISH IS A SENIOR DIRECTOR OF RELATIONSHIPS. MANAGEMENT AT TI A THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NUMBERS -- I AM HERE TO SUPPORT. AB TWO ELEVEN AS MANY OF US KNOW THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN THE U. S. HAS TOP ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS. AND THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN THIS WE BELIEVE IS A GOOD WAY TO INCENTIVIZE PARENTS GRANDPARENTS GODPARENTS. UNCLES AUNTS TO INVEST IN BY ALLOWING THEM TO TAKE A TAX DEDUCTION. ON THEIR TAX RETURNS AS MANY OF US KNOW THE TAX REFORM ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN LIMITED. ASSAULTS STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX A PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH HAS IMPACTED MANY OF US PROBABLY HERE IN THIS ROOM. AND TO CREATE THAT -- INCENTIVE TO SAVE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION -- ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T GRADUATE WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF DEBT HELPS THEM THE STUDENT I GET ON WITH THEIR LIFE FASTER BY. NOT HAVING TO LIVE WITH THEIR PARENTS BEING ABLE -- TO YOU KNOW TO START SAVING FOR THEIR FIRST HOME AND PLANNING FOR THEIR FAMILIES CURRENTLY THIRTY FOUR STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OFFER THE RESIDENTS OF FULL OR PARTIAL STATE TAX DEDUCTION OR CREDIT. CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ONE OF SEVEN STATES WITH THE STATE INCOME TAX IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY PROVIDE A STATE TAX INCENTIVE FOR CONTRIBUTIONS. TO THE STATE'S FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE PLAN SO WHAT THIS IS DON IS OP MANY OF THE STATE'S PLANS AND THEY CAN GIVE THE EXACT NUMBERS. ARE GOING OUT OF STATE TO DIFFERENT STATES THAT HAVE INCENTIVES THAT PERHAPS -- THEIR FINANCIAL ADVISORS ARE RECEIVING COMMISSIONS AND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD ALSO DO IS BRING BACK THE MONEY HERE TO CALIFORNIA HELP OUR FINANCIAL. ADVISORS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO CAN STATE SO HERE WITHOUT T. I. A. AS WELL AS A STANDS ITO OF MY FIVE TWENTY NINE SCHOLARSHIP PLAN. TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- THE PLAN AND IF THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- GOOD AFTERNOON SO BAD THAT I HAVE MY BACK TO SOME OF YOU I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT -- SO I'M HERE WITH TIAA-CREF TUITION FINANCING INK AND WE ARE PROUD TO BE THE STATE'S PARTNER IN ADMINISTRATING IN ADMINISTERING -- SCHOLAR SHARE FIVE TWO NINE AND WE SUPPORT THE PASSAGE OF AB. TWO ELEVEN DISCLOSURES BEEN RATED ONE OF THE BEST FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS IN THE COUNTRY BY MORNING STAR FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. END OF PART OF THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IS FEES PERFORMANCE AND THE OVERSIGHT OF THE SCHOLAR SHARE INVESTMENT BOARD. SO TODAY WE HAVE -- NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND FUTURE POST SECONDARY STUDENTS MOSTLY CALIFORNIANS -- INVESTED OVER EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS AND SCHOLARS ARE. FIVE TWO NINE AND THERE'S A OF COMMON MISCONCEPTION OUT THERE THAT FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS ARE ONLY FOR THE WEALTHY -- HOWEVER THE MEDIAN SCHOLAR SHARE ACCOUNT IS JUST UNDER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND 55% OF OUR CURRENT PARTICIPANTS HAVE A HOUSEHOLD INCOME UNDER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE AN INFORMATION PACKET AND THERE'S A CHART IN HERE. THAT I'LL JUST REFERENCE WORLD QUICK. WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE BILL'S INTENT IS TO HELP FAMILIES FIND RESOURCES TO SAVE MORE FOR COLLEGE -- AND ALTHOUGH -- THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF SAVINGS WOULD BE HIGHER FOR THOSE IN HIGHER INCOMES. THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME. THE SAVINGS TO THE TAX IT AS A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME THE HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MAKING BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND SO THAT AGAIN THAT CHARGES IN YOUR PACKET IF YOU'D. LIKE TO REVIEW THAT. THANK YOU RHONDA SO IT SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SCHOLAR SHARES DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN EDUCATION EXPENSES WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THAT GOING BACK INTO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WITH PAYMENTS GOING TO THE UC. THE CSU AND THE A I CC YOU MEMBER INSTITUTIONS AND TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. SO AGAIN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES A KIND OF A TAX DEDUCTION FOR CONTRIBUTIONS INTO A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. AND WE BELIEVE A STATE -- TAX INCENTIVES WOULD HAVE A DIRECT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE PROGRAMS. GROWTH BY ENCOURAGING FAMILIES TO SAVE MORE -- INCREASE PLAN PARTICIPATION HAS MULTIPLE BENEFITS OUT NOT ONLY I WILL GREATER PARTICIPATION HELP TO DRIVE FEES EVEN LOWER FOR CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE. PARTICIPANTS -- BUT CHILDREN WHO HAVE A FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT IN THEIR NAME ARE SAID TO BE UP TO TEN ARE SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO ATTEND COLLEGE AND OF COURSE SAVING ALLOWS THEM TO GRADUATE WITH LESS DEBT. THANK YOU. AND JUST TO ADD UPON -- WOODLAND IS ALREADY STATED HERE SKULL SURE IT'S BEEN AROUND NOW. FOR NEARLY A YOUR TWENTY I GUESS YOU CAN SAY -- JUST RECENTLY LAST YEAR WE SAW OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS DISTRIBUTED FOR QUALIFIED HIGHER EDUCATION EXPENSES. TO ON MAJORITY OF SCHOOLS HERE IN IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MANY WHICH ARE YOU SEE AND AND CSU CAMPUSES -- AND WE FEEL THAT THE INCREASED GROWTH IN THE FIVE TO NINE PLAN WOULD -- COULD RESULT IN OTHER BENEFITS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT THE THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE PLAN -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION ONE THING ON THE THERE'S A REFERENCE TO A A GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE REPORT. THAT WAS REFERENCED IN A LETTER IN THE MAIL SINCE -- IT STATES -- ABOUT -- 3% OF U. S. FAMILIES USE YOU ARE USING TO FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNTS AND YOU KNOW THERE IS ONE PIECE OF IT THAT -- WASN'T MISLEADING IN THAT THIRD INCLUDES A VAST MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS TO THE TEAM -- SO AMONG THE 25% OF FAMILIES THAT DO THAT HAVE MINOR CHILDREN ACCOUNT IN. TWENTY TEN ACCORDING TO THE REPORT ANY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT NUMBER APPROACH IS 15% -- ACCORDING TO THE FIVE TWO NINE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THE COLLEGE SAVINGS FOUNDATION. SO [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN IS A? RENDON WITH CALIFORNIA'S DEREGULATION. HELLO ONE SECOND THEIR ENTRY MICHAEL [inaudible] WHICH IS [inaudible] NOT CONNECTED. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED -- BRENDA BIGGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION -- THIS IS A REFORM YEAR WE'RE HOPING AND AN EXPANSION YOUR FOR CAL GRANTS AND FINANCIAL AID AND THEY'RE ALWAYS BEING EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION AS A COMPONENT IN COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE PROGRAMS ENABLE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO PREPARE TO COVER THAT COST OF ATTENDANCE THAT MEANS A BAR LESS THAT MEANS THAT ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION NUMBER GOES UP MUCH LOWER. AND THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE LESS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF FORECLOSURE DELAYED HOME STARTS DELETE FAMILY STARTS AND OTHER NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS THAT WE SEE -- COMING FROM THE STUDENT DEBT BURDENS THAT STOP PEOPLE ARE FACING TODAY SO THE COMMISSION IT DOES NOT YET HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL OR ANY BILL WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE THEM BUT I DO WANT TO COME HERE FROM HIGHER EDUCATION PERSPECTIVE. PHYLLIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIVER DOWN DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CALIFORNIA AND AN INVESTOR AND SCHOLARS HERE FOR MY SON AND WE'RE BOTH IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION? MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAMANTHA CORPSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS AS WELL AS MADAME TREASURE WHICH I TAKE GREAT JOY. IN SAYING -- ON THIS MEASURE WE HISTORICALLY OPPOSED -- TAX -- INCENTIVES OF THIS NATURE AB YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU REFLECT ON CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND THE SKYROCKETING COSTS OF CS USING UC'S IN THE STATE. I THINK IT WAS A PP I SEE REPORT SAID THAT THEY'VE TRIPLED OVER JUST THE LAST TEN YEARS ALONE AND SO THERE IS A LARGER. QUESTION TO BE ASKING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF REDUCING REVENUE TO THE STATE ON KID FOR FOURTEEN AS WELL AS FUNDS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO INTO THE CSU WHEN YOU SEE SYSTEM THAT'S MAKING IT MORE AFFORDABLE -- WE DO AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT WAS SAID IN THE ANALYSIS IN PARTICULAR THAT THIS TYPE OF INCENTIVE REALLY DOES FAVOR PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO SAVE I BELIEVE THE MEDIUM MEDIAN INCOME. OF THOSE WHO ACTUALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE TYPES OF ACCOUNTS IS AROUND A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WITH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF ASSETS AGAIN THAT'S ON MEDIAN AND AS SOMEONE WHO IS A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL -- AND FALLS PRETTY SQUARELY WITHIN THAT CATEGORY I CAN TELL YOU I WOULD NOT BE MORE OR LESS MOTIVATED TO SAVE UNFORTUNATELY. BASED ON THIS AND AND THE REASON IS IS THAT AN OVERWHELMING 68% OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN SURVEYED ABOUT THEIR LACK OF USE A FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNTS. HAVE ACTUALLY SAID THAT THEY JUST SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SAVE. AND AND SO THAT BECOMES A HUGE YOU ABILITY AT C. T. R. A. AN ADDITION TO A NUMBER OF OUR MEMBERS IN THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PART OF A LARGER COALITION. TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST WOULD LOVE TO ENGAGE YOUR OFFICE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS A LARGER CONVERSATION WE HAD ABOUT STATES PRIORITIES AND HOW DO YOU MAKE THESE TYPE OF PROGRAMS MORE SENSIBLE WITHOUT REDUCING YOU KNOW TO THE TUNE OF FORTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR INCOME TOOK I WANT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TOWARDS. CATER FOURTEEN PROGRAMS AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE BUT WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE HAVING A CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM. ME SEVEN MEMORIES. WE JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- THIS IS -- SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN REAL TO VOTE FOR ME WHEN I WAS A FINANCIAL ADVISER -- BEFORE I GOT INTO FULL TIME -- POLITICS AND SO I SOLD A LOT OF THESE A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANS AND I BUT ALWAYS TOLL. OF THE FAMILIES -- THAT START EARLYRIGHT SEE WHAT THE INTERESTING BIT BEGIN THE COMPOUND AND LOOKS AT A WEALTHY FOR ME -- IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I WAS A FINANCIAL ADVISER WAS ALWAYS THE FOLKS THAT COULD GIVE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THAT I TRIED. TO TO GET THEM TO DO -- SO THAT'S THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF ON THE THE THE HUMAN SIDE OF MY FATHER'S SIX FOOT SIX NO GREW UP ON A FARM A BIG STRAPPING GUIDE ONE OF THE ONLY TIMES I'VE EVER SEEN HIM TEAR UP. I WAS ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE I WENT OFF TO COLLEGE AND HE WAS SO UPSET HE SAID -- CHATHAM SO SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU. WITH YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION AND I WAS LIKE THAT OF COURSE I GOT THIS BUT FOR MY DAD FOR MY FAMILY PUTTING THAT FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH -- HUNDRED HOURS A MONTH OR TWO AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT. AND IF THEY WERE INCENTIVIZE THEM WITH SOME SORT OF A TAX BREAK OR TAX DEDUCTION ON THAT WOULD MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE -- SO THE ONLY THING IN MORE I WANT TO SAY IS IAN YOU GOT A COUPLE BABIES -- IF YOU HAVEN'T STARTED YET -- MAKE SURE TO START PUT LIKE MY DAD HAD [inaudible] ARTICLE. THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE WITH ME FOR A LONG TIME KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY THAT I'LL HAVE TO REPEAT IT HERE. THIS REWARDS THE PEOPLE WITH THE MOST MONEY. THE MOST AND THE PEOPLE WITH THE LEAST MONEY THE LEAST. PUTTING A THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU'RE MAKING FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR IN GETTING TWENTY DOLLARS BACK IS JUST NOT MUCH. NOW IF WE WERE TO TAKE AND ALL RIGHT SO WE WERE GIVEN A LIST. OF THOSE OF US ON THE COMMITTEE OF WHAT CHIU SHAVE DEPENDING UPON YOUR INCOME LEVEL -- AND THIS DEDUCTION WOULD BE WORTH IF YOU SAVED A THOUSAND DOLLARS TWENTY DOLLARS TO SOMEBODY YOU MAKE FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR. BUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE DOLLARS TO SOMEBODY MADE A MILLION AND A HALF WHO FOR HEAVEN SAKES CAN JUST PAY TUITION SO. I WOULD SAY ANYONE FROM THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE. TO GET FRANKLY GET THE BIGGEST BENEFITS OUT OF THIS SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. IF I WERE TO DO THIS I WOULD SORT OF TAKE YOUR CHART OF WHAT YOUR SAVINGS ARE IN TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN. AND I WOULD MATCH DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR SOMEBODY'S MAKING FIFTEEN THOUSAND I WOULD MATCH. SOMEBODY'S MAKING A HUNDRED THOUSAND MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO MAKE SOMETHING UP BUT I KNOW FOR SOMEBODY AT THE LOW END WE SHOULD JUST MATCH A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR IN THAT WOULD. THAT MIGHT WELL GET SOMEBODY TO PUT IN A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. SO IF YOU BRING THIS BACK I WOULD VERY MUCH SUGGEST YOU THINK ABOUT REORDERING WHO GETS THE BENEFITS IN THE PROGRAM AND AGAIN. MY COLLEAGUES HERE THIS FROM ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE TAX DEDUCTION. IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE pCREDIT TO MY MIND WOULD MAKE ME MUCH MORE LIKELY TO VOTE FOR IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE -- INTO SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IN OUR ONLY GOAL HERE IS TO IS TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE. TO TO TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY I ENTITIES SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND IT ISN'T JUST THE FAMILY OF THE OF THE CHILD AT OR THAT THE PARENTS OF THE CHILD'S GRANDPARENTS AS EVERYBODY ELSE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO THROW A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY AND SO MAYBE A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR BIRTHDAYS. HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE SCHOLARS ARE SO YOU KNOW I I I I'M A BELIEVER ENDS IN INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF STUFF WHEN IT COMES TO PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- WHEN IT COMES TO ARE THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND I I THINK THAT THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING IT AS OPPOSED TO BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE PAST -- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SAYING WE HAVE ON A PERCENT RIGHT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT A BILL TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WONDERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO SAY -- I AGREE. WITH MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMAN QUARTERS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT DON'T YOU HAVE A RARE. I THINK NO YOU. THERE IS TRUTH IN THAT IT HELPS PEOPLE WHO MAY BE -- WELTON BETTER POSITION TO SAVE -- BUT THAT BUT I STILL THINK WE OUGHT TO USED TO THAT -- IN THE SAME BREATH I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK WE NEED TO FIND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO DON'T FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY TO MAKE THE SAVINGS FOR THEIR KIDS ALL WHO MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR GRANTS. OR FOR SCHOLARSHIPS OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER ELSE IS AVAILABLE TO THEM IT'S IT'S A FULL PACKAGE THIS ISN'T OBVIOUSLY ENCOMPASSING EVERYTHING SO I AGREE WITH YOU IT IS KIND OF FEEL LIKE. YOU KNOW WELL WHAT ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY -- SO PERHAPS A BILL IS COMING FORWARD THAT ADDRESSES THE LITTLE GUY -- BUT I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND I'M SUPPORT THAT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE IS A AND LOOK I I WILL SAY THIS AS A SEE I I I I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE TRY TO BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO TRY TO PROVIDE AS MUCH. ASSISTANCE IN A MUCH -- AVAILABILITY TO THEIR ACCESS TO RESOURCES AS WE POSSIBLY CAN FOR THOSE THAT ARE AT THE LOWER INCOME SPECTRUM -- WHEN IT COMES TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE -- OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE AT THE HIGHER INCOME LEVELS DON'T REALLY NEED THE HELP BUT THERE'S A HUGE MIDDLE CLASS AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER BUT WE HAD TO FIGHT GOVERNOR BROWN WHEN IT CAME TO THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP BECAUSE THERE'S A LARGE MIDDLE CLASS HERE. WHERE YOU KNOW THEY'RE PERCEIVED TO BE MAKING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT THE MIDDLE CLASS IN CALIFORNIA IS DIFFERENT IN THE MIDDLE CLASS? IN IN ANOTHER STATE -- AND SO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IS MAKING A LOT BUT AT THE SAME DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL OR GIVE THEM SOME TYPE OF OF THE ADVANTAGE. OF A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS I BELIEVE WOULD HELP THEM -- AND I THINK IS NECESSARY BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE FEEDBACKS ALL THINGS WE WILL TAKE OUR EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY ALONG WITH THE ANALYSIS AND SUGGESTIONS THAT ARE MADE. IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN AGAIN LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH NOT ONLY COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT ALSO THE OPPOSITION. THANKS TO HER ROOM THANKS NOT A CHAIR THIS CALL RUN THANK YOU BRING THIS FORWARD AS YOU SAID IT'S BEEN TRIED A COUPLE OF TIMES -- SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS WOULD ACTUALLY SPOKEN THE OFFICE WE'VE BEEN ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT ANYWAY I CAN. AND I SHE LOOKED AT THIS FOR MY KIDS AND THE ONLY INCENTIVE THEY OFFER RIGHT NOW SHE CAN PULL IT OUT TAX FREE BUT I CAN PULL IT OUT OF SAVINGS ACCOUNT TAX FREE TOO SO. I REALLY DIDN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SUPPOSE ONE OF MY KIDS WANTS TO BE A CHEF AND I DON'T GO TO UC SCHOOL OR SOMETHING THEN. I'M A LITTLE MORE LIMITED IF I HAVE A FIVE TWENTY NINE SO THAT'S WHY THE PURSUIT BUT I ACTIVELY LOOK TO TRYING TO OPEN ONE OF THESE FOR BOTH OF THE CHILDREN SO. LET ME KNOW I CAN HELP IN GALA THANK YOU [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. SO I WOULD ADD SIMPLY ADD THAT I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE INCOME SPECTRUM ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR COLLEGE. STRUGGLING TO REPAY STUDENT THAT AND WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO INCENTIVIZE THIS KIND OF OF BEHAVIOR AND THIS KIND OF OF PLANNING. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY STRIKING THAT WE ARE WANTING ONLY SEVEN STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME KIND OF INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND THAT FEELS TO ME LIKE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY SO. I'M ALSO HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTIVE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AND LIMóN [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. I WILL ALSO BE YEAH. YES -- THIS -- WERE FOR TESTIMONY ONLY BUT IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- HE CAN I JUST ANSWER COUPLE -- OF OF QUESTIONS AS WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK -- I BELIEVE IN THE SAME THING RIGHT WE SHOULD -- HELP THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST -- TAX CREDIT. BILLS COST A LOT MORE THAN TAX DEDUCTION BILLS -- BUT I THINK IF WE WANTED TO LIMIT THE TAX CREDIT TO CERTAIN INCOME LEVELS THAT MAY BE. AN OPTION AND WOULD KEEP THE COST LOWER. WE ALSO OFFER A MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM AT SCHOLARSHIP AND I WOULD LOVE FOR STAND TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T. NECESSARILY KNOW ABOUT IT AND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES. AND OTHERS -- SO MEMBER BRO WHEN TALKS TO YOU I ALWAYS ASK PARENTS WHERE IS YOUR FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN AND A LOT OF THE DON'T KNOW AND THEN THEY CALL THEIR FINANCIAL ADVISER IN THERE LIKE. OH MY GOD MY PLAN IS IN OTHER STATES AND EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE A FIVE TWENTY NINE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR PLAN IS BUT A LOT OF IT IS NOT HERE IN THE STATE SO WE BELIEVE. WITH A INCENTIVE TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS POTENTIALLY COULD COME BACK TO THE STATE AND THAT IS JUST OUT OF STATE MONEY BUT HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD TRANSFER IT BACK IN. AND THEN CONTINUE TO GET THAT TAX INCENTIVE MOVING FORWARD BUT IF SANTA ALSO JUST ADD ABOUT THE MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS. AVAILABLE AT YOUR ELIGIBLE NOW FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO OPEN ONE WITHOUT THE RETROACTIVITY. WITHOUT ACTUALLY. THANK YOU -- YEAH THE THE MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM THE TREASURE MOM AND MENTIONED IS -- WHERE WE JUST STARTED OUR SECOND YEAR OF THE MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM -- IT'S HAS SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ONE OF WHICH IS. THAT THE AGI FOR THE THE FAMILIES PARTICIPATING WOULD HAVE TO BE LESS THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- FOLKS THAT CONTRIBUTE OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT FOR NEW BENEFICIARY. THEY WILL BE MATCHED DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR UP TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR -- AND THEN THEY'LL GET A BONUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS CONTRIBUTION PLAN. SO -- THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR WE'RE DOING IT WE JUST STARTED AGAIN THIS FEBRUARY -- AND WE HAVE -- WE GOT SOME GREAT RESULTS LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF A LOT OF ACTIVITY WE HOPE -- TO WORK WITH FAMILIES OF CLOSER THIS YEAR TO GET ANY MORE FAMILIES OPENING CALVIN SAVINGS. I WOULD DO A FIVE TWENTY NINE DAY HERE AT THE CAPITOL INCENTIVIZE EVERYONE TO COME DOWN AND OPEN UP YOUR FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN. OKAY THOUGH BECAUSE THAT'S GREAT TOM. I DO WANT TO SEE VERY QUICKLY THAT DOCTOR COURT DOES MAKE THIS POINT REGULARLY IN THIS COMMITTEE AND AND IT IS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY DECENT POINT. I COMPLETELY SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A SITUATION IN THIS COMMITTEE WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF TAX DEDUCTIONS THAT DO NOT BENEFIT ACTUALLY ARE LOWER INCOME FAMILIES OR EVEN OUR MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES BUT REALLY ONLY BENEFIT. OUR WEALTHIEST FAMILIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THIS COMMITTEE IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE MOMENTS YOU HAVE TAKEN. AND WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE COMMENTS FROM THOSE HERE TODAY I WITH THAT IT'S A TEST MONEY ONLY SO WHEN IT COMES TIME WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBERS PROJECT. MOVING BACK TO FILE ITEM ONE THE OUTLINES. CALL THE ABSENTEES [inaudible] GRAY [inaudible] MULLIN. MELENDEZ MULLIN DESIGN BECAUSE IT [inaudible] REVERSE. I WOULD LIKE TO FIGHT A MINOR ONE I KNOW FIGHT ON FILE ITEM ONE WE'RE JUST ADDING OUT ON FOR THOSE WHO ARE. HI THREE WITH I AM VERY. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL BE MOVING BACK TO FILE ITEM TO AB. ONE FIFTY TWO MADAM CHAIR CALLING. AB ONE FIFTY TWO IS THE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT [inaudible] PROGRAM [inaudible] AND IT'S A STUDENT LOAN ASSISTANCE ACT. WHICH WORKS TO ADDRESS THE COLLEGE DEBT AT THE THAT MAKE IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. AS YOU ALREADY KNOW IT IT'S ALREADY BEEN TESTIFIED. AVERAGE. IS ONE FORTY FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS OF STUDENT DEBT IN THE UNITED STATES TWENTY TWO THOUSAND IN CALIFORNIA. ON CAPITOL HILL -- IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS ONE THIRD OF EMPLOYERS OF INCREASED EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FORCING. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS BACK TO SCHOOL TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION AND KERR. MORE STUDENT DEBT AB ONE FIFTY TWO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE LOAN EPIDEMIC IN OUR OWN STATE BY PROVIDING. A TAX FREE INCENTIVE ON THE STATE TAX PORTION OF THE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PLAN CURRENTLY A STUDENT REPAYMENT PLAN OFFERED BY AN EMPLOYER. IS CONSIDERED INCOME OR A LEAVING THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA GRADUATES FACE IN INTEREST CHARGES AND INCREASED DEBT. I TAX FREE INCENTIVE ON THE STATE TAX PORTION OF THE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PLAN WILL ASSIST RECENT GRADUATES IN GETTING OUT OF DEBT. AB ONE FIFTY TWO IS SPONSORED BY THE LOS ANGELES CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AND I WOULD. EASILY TAKE ANY AMENDMENTS OR ANY ADVICE FROM THIS COMMITTEE OF THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WE'RE CURRENTLY WAITING FROM LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ADD A FIVE YEARS SUNSET ON HIS BILL IN COMPLIANCE WITH REVENUE WOULD TAX CODE SECTION. FORTY ONE FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY -- WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS BILL AT SOME FUTURE TIME. ADDITIONAL INNOCENCE IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. COR ABOUT HOW THE COMPANY TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION I WILL THE LABOR HAVE A SIMILAR COMMITTEE SIMILAR ON THE BOTTOM. SO THE WHITE BUT OF HOME. OKAY AGAIN. SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION I DON'T WANNA BELIEVER THE COMMITTEE WITH SIMILAR POINTS BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AS SORT OF SIMILAR HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION IN TERMS OF WHAT'S THE BEST BENEFIT FOR THE STATE. I WILL SAY THAT -- IN REGARDS TO THIS SIMILAR TO THE LAST MEASURE THERE IS AT WE DO DEEPLY HAVE CONCERNS BOTH IN REGARDS TO THE REDUCTION OF A FUNDING TO THE STATE AND OTHER VITAL PROGRAMS INCLUDING OF COURSE K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION. BUT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS OF PAYING DOWN STUDENT DEBT -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR FAMILIES TO PURCHASE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO CONSIDER CAPPING IN ALLOCATING THOSE AMOUNTS SPECIFICALLY SO NOT JUST TARGETING THEM TO THE POPULATIONS WHO NEED THEM THE MOST BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST AN UNKNOWN AMOUNT OF FUNDING GOING OUT EVERY SINGLE YEAR -- BUT WE DO CURRENTLY OPPOSE WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOUR OFFICE THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS HERE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NINE THAT WE HAVE RECOMMENDED -- JUST FOR YOUR JUST OF THE IT'S ON THE RECORD WE HAVE RECOMMENDED A FEW. AMENDMENTS AND WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME COMING FROM -- LET'S COUNSEL WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU PLEASE. THE NEXT. MOVING TO FILE AND THREE AB. ONE FIFTY THREE ONE FIFTY THREE IT WOULD. INCREASE A TAX DEDUCTION FOR FAMILIES WHO HOST FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENTS ATTEND IN K. TWELVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. THESE FAMILIES OPENER HOMES TO HOUSE THESE STUDENTS AND RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THEIR EFFORTS BUT THEN DURING TAX SEASON THEIR BLINDSIDED BY TAXES ON EXTRA INCOME RECEIVED. FAMILIES CURRENTLY RECEIVE A FIFTY DOLLAR TAX DEDUCTION BOTH FEDERALLY AND ANOTHER FIFTY DOLLAR TAX DEDUCTION FROM THE STATE. PER STUDENT TAKEN IN AB ONE FIFTY THREE WHAT INSTEAD GIVE A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR. TAX DEDUCTION ER STUDENT IN THE FAMILY HOLES. THE WORST PART OF THE ADDITIONAL TAX IS THAT SOME FAMILIES THAT PARTICIPATE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. AND IN THE END OF FAMILY MIGHT END UP OWING OUT OF POCKET MONEY UNDER TAX RETURNS WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY HURT PARTICIPATION OF THESE FAMILIES -- JUST ANOTHER. LITTLE THING TO HELP OUT. FAMILIES THAT WANT TO HOST STUDENTS. WHEN THIS IS IN SUPPORT? WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COME ON UP. GO TO THE TABLE NO. ME TO TIME. AS WITH THE CURRENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION PERHAPS UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER MEASURES HEARD IN COMMITTEE TODAY WE JUST FLATLY OPPOSE THIS -- POLICY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE STUDENTS HERE SO IRONICALLY THE PROGRAM ITSELF WOULD REDUCE FUNDS FOR KIDS -- FOURTEEN FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT THE STUDENTS WOULD ACTUALLY COME HERE TO BENEFIT FROM -- AT A TIME WHERE THE STATE IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT ADAPTING TO FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY EFFORTS -- MULTIPLYING BY TEN THE DEDUCTION AND MOVING IN OUT OF ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL THAT DEDUCTIONS WE CONSIDER NOT ONLY TO BE UNNECESSARY BUT AS A JUST BAD IT ON ITS FACE AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY AND FOR THAT LIKE I STARK WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE. THANK YOU. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SEEING. NINE THE WE ALSO HAVE RECOMMENDED. AMENDMENTS FOR THIS BILL AS WELL. AND IT IS DEFINITELY ONLY MOVING ON TO A FILE ITEM FOR AB. ONE FIFTY FIVE ONE FIFTY FIVE THIS MAJOR WOULD ALLOW A TAX CREDIT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO BUILD A HOME. FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING IT THEIR PRINCIPAL HOME. IT'S A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT HOPES TO ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CRISIS AS WELL AS TO ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS TO BUILD THEIR OWN HOME. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY RANKED AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATES IN THE NATION I WILL GO AND ALL THE NUMBERS AND EVERYTHING BUT WE ALL KNOW IT'S HARD. TO DO ANY HOUSING IN THIS STATE NO MATTER HOW RICH OR POOR YOUR TO GET NEAR -- DUE TO RISING PRICE OF HOMES THAT CALIFORNIA BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THIS LEGISLATIVELY. NOW. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO QUALIFY FOR THIS TAX CREDIT THEY'RE BUILDING COST OF THE HOME SHOULD NOT EXCEED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FURTHER INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE HOME THEIR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE. THIS TAX CREDIT WILL BE APPLE COLD TO A HOME BUILT BETWEEN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO WE'RE NOT. MAKING THIS PERMANENT -- IF IT WORKS IT WORKS IF IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T. NOW THE REASON FOR PUTTING THAT CRY TO PLACES TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO EVERYONE. THAT THIS ISN'T TO SUPPORT LARGE DEVELOPERS ARE LARGE -- HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS BUT RATHER INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE A SMALL PLOT OF LAND. IN WHO BUILT A HOME ON THAT LAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF LIVING ON IT SO IT'S NOT EVEN GRANNY FLATS OR ANYTHING IT SAYS. BUILDING YOUR INITIAL HOME-- IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE HOUSING PROBLEMS IN OUR STATE BUT I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ANOTHER LITTLE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION LUNCH COME TO THE TABLE. SINCE WE HAVE TECHNICAL ISSUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SOME AT THE CORBIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WE HAVE MULTIPLE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS MEASURE AND FOR THAT REASON ARE IN OPPOSITION I THINK. COMMON TO A LOT OF OTHER BILLS HER BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- AND EXCUSE ME I'M AND APPARENTLY THE AGE NOW WHERE ANY BIFOCALS -- AB ONE FIVE FIVE IS NOT TARGETED TO ANY SPECIFIC POPULATION SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT REALLY ANY INDIVIDUAL. ANYWHERE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS REGARDLESS OF OF THE NECESSITY OF THAT AND YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS TARGETED FOR EXAMPLE TO I THINK IS THE ANALYSIS POINTED OUT WILD FIRE VICTIMS OR PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN INCOME. THAT YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT QUESTION AND AND AND CERTAINLY SERVE A DIFFERENT PUBLIC POLICY NEED -- I KNOW YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOUR INTENT IS NOT TO COVER LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OR OTHERWISE BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEFINITION SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO WHAT IS A BUILDING COSTS THAT QUALIFIES -- WHAT IS NEW BUILDING MEAN -- IT'S CENTER CAPTION PROJECT THAT'S MAYBE IN A LARGER DEVELOPMENT QUALIFY UNDER THIS MEASURE IT'S FRANKLY UNCLEAR -- IN ADDITION TO THAT -- CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HAS A NUMBER OF BENEFITS TO HOMEOWNERS IN PARTICULAR -- AND WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE YEARS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO CALIFORNIA'S SECOND HOME CREDIT FOR EXAMPLE. AS ONE EXAMPLE. THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY. A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE THESE HOMES FOR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCES -- AND CERTAINLY EVEN IF THEY DO INITIALLY OVER TIME THEY MAY NOT -- AND SO WITH SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PUBIC POLICY MERIT OF THIS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE AMBIGUITY AND DEFINITIONS AS WELL AS THE SCOPING AND FOR THAT REASON WE CURRENTLY OPPOSE THINKING. THANK YOU. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE START WORK. YES -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE BEST WITH THESE THREE BELLS BUT I DO WANT ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE REMARKS MADE BY THE TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION. AND THEN JUST ADD THE COMMENT I MADE -- ABOUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON'S BILL WHICH IS THAT THE BIGGEST BENEFIT DâN 13% FOR EXAMPLE TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE. OVER MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND ALMOST NO BENEFIT. ONE OR 2% FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY FORTY THOUSAND A YEAR. AND SO IN MY MIND THE BENEFIT HERE IS GOING TO THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED IT IS SUPPOSED TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE.
