THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER RECENT COURT CASE CAL NELL GARDENS VERSUS CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS UNDERMINED THE APPLICATION OF MELLOW AND DENSITY BONUS LAW. IN THE COASTAL ZONE IN THAT CASE THE DEVELOPER PROPOSED A SMALL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT INCLUDED AFFORDABLE UNITS. AT WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MELLOW ACT AND THE DENSITY BONUS UNDER OUR STATE LAWS. AND ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT WAS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH LOCAL PLANNING AND ZONING AND DENSITY BONUS LAW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DENIED THE PROJECT ON THE BASIS THAT THE INCREASED DENSITY. MADE THE PROJECT VISUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD IN VIOLATION OF THE COSTA LACK. THE APPELLATE COURT UPHELD THIS DENIAL FINDING THAT THE COASTAL ACT SUPERSEDES DENSITY BONUS LAW AND IF. NOT CORRECTED THIS DECISION WILL LIKELY PREVENT DENSITY BONUS LAW FROM BEING USED AT ALL ANYWHERE IN THE COASTAL ZONE AND UNDERMINE THE PRESERVATION OF PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. UNDER THE MELLOW ACT THE RESULT WILL BE FEWER AFFORDABLE UNITS WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE THAT'S A RESULT THAT WE CAN. NOT AFFORD AND SO AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN WILL CLARIFY OPPOSED PROVISION IN DENSITY BONUS LAW TO ENSURE THAT A PROJECT. CANNOT BE FOUND IN CONSISTENT WITH THE COASTAL ACT MERELY BECAUSE IT RECEIVES A DENSITY BONUS. INCREASE UNDER STATE LAW.

A POLITICAL APPOINTEE FOR MAKING A CONTRIBUTION OR PROVIDING A GIFT TO A LEGISLATOR OR ANY COMMITTEE CONTROLLED BY THAT LEGISLATOR DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE APPOINTEES SEEKING CONFIRMATION. UNDER EXISTING LAW AS WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL ON THE HEELS OF THE RECENT FORM SEVEN HUNDRED DEADLINE. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LEGISLATORS LOBBYIST LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND OTHER GROUPS TO INTERACT WITH THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS ARE SUBJECT TO THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT.

RARE THAN LIMIT THE CORE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO CONFIRM A POLITICAL APPOINTMENT. WE SHOULD ALSO LIMIT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ONE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE NOMINATION. IN A RECENT ARTICLE BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES THE HIGHLIGHTED MULTIPLE APPOINTMENTS BY THE CURRENT AND FORMER GOVERNOR THAT HAVE MADE. UP THAT HAVE BEEN MADE INFLUENTIAL FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS APPOINTED TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AFTER DONATING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GOVERNOR BROWN'S CAMPAIGN. THE SECOND INDIVIDUAL WAS APPOINTED TO THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AFTER MAKING THE SAME DONATION. A THIRD INDIVIDUAL. WAS CONTINUALLY APPOINTED TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AFTER DONATING THOUSANDS TO GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S AND GOVERNOR BROWN'S CAMPAIGNS.

IT'S SOMETHING I'LL TWENTY FIFTEEN BY FAMILY MEMBER KALRA AND ACTUALLY CANNABIS. MISTER KALRA EMAIL ME. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS SOME OF BILL TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN. WHAT ALLOW BETTER NEW YEAR VETERINARIANS TO DISCUSS THE USE OF CANNABIS WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR LICENSE? ENABLES CANNABIS FOR MEDICINAL ANIMAL USED TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATED DISPENSARIES. AND WHEN I SAY DISCUSSION I MEAN THE CLIENT IS COMING IN WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICS ARE SEEING ON THE STORE SHELVES THIS IS AT OPPOSES CBD OILS. AND THEY WANT TO KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE HELPFUL FOR THEIR ARTHRITIC. ARTHRITIC OR CANCER RIDDEN PET. CONTRARY TO WIDELY HELD KNOWLEDGE VETERINARIANS DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT POSITIONS ARE GIVEN I IN DISCUSSING CANNABIS IN THEIR PRACTICE. THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS AB TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN. AND RECENTLY SHOWED. SHOULD BE BOTH SIR BROCHURE FOR A PET CBD PRODUCT. THAT WAS MAKING THE CLAIM IT IN CURE CANCER FOR THE PAT. THOSE WILD CLAIMS ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE ANIMAL OWNING CONSUMER. HOWEVER CANNABIS HAS SHOWN PROMISING MEDICINAL AND THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS FOR ANIMALS BECAUSE THE POSSESS SIMILAR AND OKANAGAN NO IT'S SYSTEMS LIKE HUMANS. LASTLY THE BILL INSURERS THESE CANNABIS PRODUCTS MEDICINAL ANIMAL USE ONLY CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED AND ARE REGULATED FRAMEWORK. THIS IS WHY BUSINESS GROUPS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS AB TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN AM. THE BILL ALSO HAS STRONG SUPPORT FROM SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION ONE OF THE LEADING ANIMAL WELFARE ADVOCACY GROUPS BECAUSE THEY SEE THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH. AN IMPROVEMENT TO WHAT MANY LOVING PET OWNERS ARE ALREADY DOING. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IT I DON'T. THINK YOU MISTER KALRA MISTER BIGELOW YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE. TO TO GIVE A LITTLE CLARITY TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL. WHEN IT WAS IN A PROBE. I ACTUALLY TOOK A POSITION OF OPPOSITION TO THIS MY RAISE THE ISSUE TO THE AUTHOR AND THE AUTHOR HAS. AGREED TO WORK WITH MY OFFICE AND TRY TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO THIS PARTICULAR MATTER. HE HAS GOT A ACTUALLY LEGITIMATE POINT WHEN IT DEALS WITH THE VETERINARIANS AND TRYING TO CLEAR UP THAT THE DIFFERENCE ON THIS PRODUCT. BUT WHAT WAS REALLY LEFT ANONYMOUS IN THE US WAS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE OCCURRING HERE. ONE WOULD BE FOR SMALL ANIMALS THE OTHER WOULD BE FOR LIVESTOCK THAT ISSUES FOR INGESTING. THE PRODUCTS THAT WE EAT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS TO US AS CONSUMERS THIS COULD ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE HARMFUL. IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HELPFUL WE DON'T KNOW BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THAT YOU CAN. ADMINISTER THIS PRODUCT THE LIVESTOCK IT'S EITHER THROUGH ORAL. IT'S THROUGH INJECTABLE BOTH. AYE INTRAMUSCULAR AND SUBCUTANEOUS OR TOPICAL. AGAIN THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO WORK ON THIS AND I WANT IT PLEDGE MY OFFICE IS SUPPORT TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER COLOR. THANK YOU YOU SPEAKER THANK YOU MISS BIGELOW MISTER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IF I CAN ASK QUESTION THE AUTHOR. THAT'S WITHOUT OBJECTION. I IN TERMS OF ANIMALS ARE USED FOR TRANSPORTATION FORCES AND OTHERS HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT. FORCES OR OTHER ANIMALS THEY'RE USED FOR TRANSPORTATION OF PEOPLE ON OUR ROADS. THANK YOU MISS HARPER MISTER KALRA. YOU MAY ADDRESS THAT NOW OR. CLOSE. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. MISTER KALRA. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANNA THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THE OTHER QUESTION REGARDING IN TRANSPORTATION AGAIN. ABA THE IDEA BEHIND THIS BILL ON ONE OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS IS TO ALLOW THE VETERAN A BOARD TO SET GUIDELINES NOT LET ME OR OTHERS GUESS AS TO WHAT IS NEEDED. BUT ACTUALLY MOVE PET CANNABIS INTO A REGULAR FRAMEWORK AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE ANSWERING QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHAT TO DO IN TRANSPORT AS WELL AS THE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER IS AND MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS VIRULENT ANTI SEMITISM IS ON THE RISE BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. ANTI SEMITIC INCIDENTS ROSE FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT THAT THAT'S THE LARGEST ONE YEAR INCREASE SINCE THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE HAS TRACKED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN FRANCE AND ANTI SEMITIC ASSAULT IS REPORTED ON AVERAGE TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK ACROSS EUROPE IS MUCH THE SAME STORY IN RUSSIA. HATE MONGERS TOOK TO SOCIAL MEDIA IN MARCH TO CAST BASELESS BLAME ON CHOOSE FOR A TRAGIC. MALL FIRE THAT KILLED SIXTY FOUR. AND IN POLAND IN FEBRUARY PRESENT ANDRE DO DA SIGNED AN AMENDMENT TO THE LAW ON INSTITUTE OF NATIONAL REMEMBRANCE THAT THREATENS UP TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON MERELY FOR SUGGESTING. THERE WAS POLISH COMPLICITY WITH* ATROCITIES DURING WORLD WAR TWO. THIS IS LITERALLY A LAW AGAINST TALKING ABOUT THE TRUTH LET'S BE CLEAR. POLLS SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE* AND MANY POLL FOUGHT BRAVELY IN RESISTANCE BUT THERE WERE INDEED COLLABORATORS. THAT IS HISTORICAL FACT. WITH THIS RESOLUTION WE ADD OUR VOICES TO THOSE THAT CALL ON POLAND TO ABANDON THIS LAW OUR STATE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPRESSED SIMILAR SENTIMENTS MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE AS WELL. WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT CONGRESS TAKE FORMAL ACTION TO ENCOURAGE PRESIDENT DO DOT? TO REVERSE COURSE MEANWHILE WE WANT TO KEEP OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER THIS RESOLUTION ALSO REAFFIRMS CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO HOLOCAUST EDUCATION. EDUCATION IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. A STUDY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT JUST IN APRIL DURING THE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE CEREMONY FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF MILLENNIALS DO NOT KNOW WHAT AUSCHWITZ'S. THERE WERE OVER FORTY THOUSAND CAMPS AND GHETTOS DURING THE HOLOCAUST IN THE SURVEY FOUND THAT FORTY NINE PERCENT OF MILLENNIALS COULD NOT NAME ONE. SIMON WIESENTHAL* HUNTER SAID FOR YOUR BENEFIT LEARN FROM OUR TRAGEDY IT IS NOT WRITTEN LAW BUT THE NEXT VICTIMS MUST BE JEWS.

IN DAY ARE THIRTY FIVE URGES LAWMAKERS IN POLAND TO REVERSE A RECENT LAW THAT WOULD CRIMINALIZE SOME SPEECH RELATED TO POLAND'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE HOLOCAUST DURING THE* GERMAN OCCUPATION OF POLAND. CENSORSHIP CANNOT UNDO THE TRAGEDIES OF THE PAST AND JUST LIKE AMERICANS TODAY MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAST ATROCITIES SO SHOULD OTHER NATIONS. DENYING THE TRUTH ONLY INHIBITS US FROM MOVING FORWARD AND BECOMING BETTER AS WE EXPERIENCED MOMENTS AGO HERE IN THE GALLERY. AJ OUR THIRTY FIVE IS TIMELY BECAUSE WHILE POLAND ATTEMPTS TO CRIMINALIZE THOSE WHO SPEAK OUT ABOUT UNFLATTERING TRUTHS OF THEIR ROLE IN THE HOLOCAUST. ANTI SEMITISM ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES IS ON THE RISE. WE MUST REMAIN STEADFAST IN OUR OBLIGATION TO NEVER REPEAT THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST AND PART OF THIS COMES FROM LEARNING ALL WE CAN ABOUT WHAT HAS OCCURRED. THIS RESOLUTION ALSO CALLS FOR A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO HOLOCAUST EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. WE CANNOT DIMINISH THE IMPACT THE COUNTRY HAD DURING THE HOLOCAUST NOR CAN WE CHOOSE TO OMIT UNFLATTERING TRUTHS BY CENSORING SPEECH AND HINDERING THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT AJ ARE THIRTY SIX AND I URGE OUR SUPPORT TODAY AS WELL. THANK YOU SEEN NO ADDITIONAL MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION.

IF WE AS A STATE ARE GOING TO MEET OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LOW EMISSION AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD WE MUST ENSURE THAT. CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ARE NOT PUT IT THE DISADVANTAGE IN RELATION TO THE OUT OF STATE AUTOMAKERS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN LARGE MULTINATIONAL AUTO MAKERS AND CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERS IS A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE PLAYING FIELD. IN SPITE OF THE OPPOSITION OF THE AUTOMAKERS AND THE REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE THIS BILL CONTINUES TO NOW IT'S IN SCOPE AND ADDRESS ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS.

THE CURRENT FEDERAL RULE ESTABLISHES THAT OUT OF WORK RECIPIENTS OF CAL FRESHER LIMITED TO THREE MONTHS OF EIGHT ANY THIRTY SIX MONTH PERIOD. CALIFORNIA HAS A WAIVER TO THIS RULE AND IT IS A GOOD UNTIL AUGUST OF THIS YEAR WHEN OUR STATE WIDE WAIVER EXPIRES. I REQUEST FOR CONTINUED WAIVER FOR SOME COUNTIES WITH HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT A RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE NEWLY RELEASED TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR FARM BILL SUGGESTS THAT THE FUTURE OF THESE AREA WAIVERS DURING THIS TIME OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. UNCLEAR THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE WORK RATES AMONG CAO FRESH RECIPIENTS ARE HIGH WOULD NEARLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF ADULTS ABLE TO WORK EARNING INCOME TO EMPLOYMENT. BUT CAO FRESH IS THERE ALSO TO HELP PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE OUT OF WORK OR BETWEEN JOBS AND CUTTING PEOPLE OFF DURING THIS TIME MAKES IT HARDER FOR THEM TO FIND A JOB. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO ESTABLISH THEY HUNGER THRESHOLD THAT WOULD IDENTIFY WHEN A PERSON IS TWO HUNDRED TO BE ON EMPLOYABLE. THE BILL DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT TO CONVENE A WORK GROUP OF POSITIONS WERE EXPERT IN ADULT HUNGER AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST TO ESTABLISH THAT PRESS CHAU AND DESIGNED SCREENING TO BE USED. BY COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS ONCE IN PLACE A PERSON WAS SCREEN IS BEING UNFIT FOR WORK DUE TO HUNGER WILL BE TEMPORARILY EXEMPT FROM THE THREE MONTH TIME LIMIT. SIMPLY PUT AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY TWO WOULD HELP PREVENT OUT OF WORK CALIFORNIANS WERE GOING HUNGRY ABOUT DOING SO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL GET BACK TO WORK. IT IS CRUEL TO CUT OFF LOW INCOME FAN AMERICANS WHO DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE SOURCE OF INCOME FROM ANTI HUNGER FOOD HEALTH AND IS ALSO DOESN'T HELP THEM FIND A JOB.

UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WHO BEEN ATTEMPTING TO BUILD THIS HOUSING OFTEN TELL US IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO BUILD DUE TO LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESSES. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO STREAMLINED APPROVAL OF ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS AS WELL AS ON SITE SERVICES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO APPLY OBJECTIVE AND QUANTIFIABLE DESIGN STANDARDS. AS WE FINALLY BEGIN AS A STATE TO START INVESTING IN HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED MORE CERTAINTY FOR THOSE WHO ARE BUILDING THESE UNITS SO THAT WE CAN GET THEM ONLINE QUICKLY.

THREATENING TO HARM SOMEONE ELSE OR YOURSELF THE ACLU HAS GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE OF SOME OF THOSE REASONS. I'D. PERSONALLY I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHERE THE AUTHOR IS GOING WITH THIS AND I THINK THAT IF WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS ON A ON A REGULAR BASIS IF YOU WELL. OUT OF BEING DETAINED AND. AND HELD BY MEDICAL FACILITY FACILITY AND. BEING RECOMMENDED FOR THAT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WE CERTAINLY. I'M WANT TO INTERVENE. BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS A CASE WHERE ONE SHOULD LOSE THEIR RIGHTS FOR FOR LIFE. AS YOU ALL KNOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY. PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY PERHAPS PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN FAMILY MAYBE EVEN YOURSELF WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH A PERIOD OF TIME IN THEIR LIVES WHERE. THINGS BEGIN TO FALL APART AND PERHAPS. THEY'RE TAKEN IN ON THIS TYPE OF HOLD DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HARM SOMEONE OR THEMSELVES OF THAT THEY WILL DO SO. TEN YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW I THINK THEY THEY AYE I THINK THEY HAVE WE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY. TO. TO HAVE THAT CAREFULLY CONSIDERED RATHER THAN TO JUST TAKE THERE'S RIGHT AWAY.

TO TRY TO STIGMATIZE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES UP FOR EVER I THINK SOMETIMES CAN BE SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT IN THE MOMENT. OF BUT IF WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL ISSUE OF OF GUNS AND PEOPLE GETTING HURT WITH THEM I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT DEEPER. A AND IF WE REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET HELP. THEN I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT LIFETIME CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE WANT PEOPLE TO GET HELP WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE SHYING AWAY FROM GETTING HELP NOR DO WE WANT THEIR FAMILIES NOT TO BE. SEEKING HELP FOR THEM. WHEN THEY ARE IN NEED OF HELP A AND AGAIN WE KNOW MENTAL HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TREATED BUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE RESOURCES AND BEING ABLE TO HELP FOLKS.
