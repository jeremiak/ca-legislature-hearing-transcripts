AND WERE -- OPPOSE UNLESS

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:16.509
AMENDED ON THIS BILL WE DO

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:17.743
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.211
THE AUTHOR HAS GENERATED BOTH

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:20.846
LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR.

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:21.614
REGARDING THE ME TO MOVE IN

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.948
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS AND I

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.216
THINK IT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:25.651
CONVERSATION ABOUT.

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:27.219

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:31.257
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BUT WE DO.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.224
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:33.959
WITH US FOR TWO AMENDMENTS THAT

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:36.395
WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION --

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:37.563
THE FIRST IS.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.431
WE BELIEVE THE BILL SHOULD BE

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:39.031
LIMITED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:40.833
CLAIMS -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.501
THE CONVERSATION -- AND THE

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:44.070
UNIQUE NATURE OF SEXUAL

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:44.970
HARASSMENT CLAIMS.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.072
IT'S BEEN AROUND SEXUAL

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:46.739
HARASSMENT AND WE THINK THE BILL

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:48.707
SHOULD BE LIMITED THE BILL

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:50.576
APPLIES TO ALL FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.144

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:53.612
OF HARASSMENT ALL FORMS OF

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.347
DISCRIMINATION IS NOT LIMITED TO

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:56.215
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:57.783
AND WHILE WE DO THINK OTHER

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.418
FORMS OF HARASSMENT AND

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.087
DISCRIMINATION CAN BE DRAMATIC.

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:03.255
WE DO THINK THE CONVERSATION HAS

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:03.823
REVEALED THERE SOME UNIQUE

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.258
DYNAMICS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:06.992
CLAIMS.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:11.363
THAT MAY WARRANT A LONGER

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.331
STATUTORY PERIOD.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:12.832
WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:13.899
PROPONENTS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.034
SPLITTING -- FIAT CAUSES OF

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:15.935
ACTIONS WITH DIFFERENT STATUE OF

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:16.268
LIMITATIONS.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.570
WE UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN BUT

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:18.737
THAT'S SORT OF THE NATURE OF

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:20.339
EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS IN THE LABOR

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.907
CODE CONTEXT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:23.442
CLAIMS WITH DIFFERENT STATUTORY --

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:24.910
PERIOD YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:26.512
YEARS FOR WAGE CLAIMS YOU HAVE

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.713
FOR YEARS IF YOU BRING UNFAIR

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.115
COMPETITION CLAIM.

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:29.982
YOU HAVE ONE YEAR FOR POCKET

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.717
CLAIM SO IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:34.553
TO HAVE DIFFERENT STATUTORY --

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.222
PERIODS.

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.256
SO WE BELIEVE THIS BILL SHOULD

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:37.990
BE -- NARROWED TO SEXUAL

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.291
HARASSMENT CLAIMS WE ALSO

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.026
BELIEVE THE BILL SHOULD CLEARLY

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.962
ONLY APPLY TO CLAIMS ON A GOING

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:44.497

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.166
ABOUT THAT POINT WITH MY WITH

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:48.234
THOSE TWO AMENDMENTS WE WOULD

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.135
REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO THE

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.336
BILL.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:55.975

WAS REAL FUR I'M KIND OF A

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:44.983
REVERSIBLE AS WHAT USED TO

AUTOMOBILE IT CABS AREN'T RAISED

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:11.109
IN SMALL CASE -- PENS FOR THEIR

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.044
ENTIRE LIVES THEY'VE EXPRESSED

00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:14.512
THAT DESIRE TO KNOW THAT IF A

WITH FOR PRODUCTS AND THAT'S

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:28.994
REALLY THE BOTTOM LINE.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.396
SO RETAILERS LIKE GUCCI AND

WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA AS A

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:42.140
TRAILBLAZER SHOULD BE THE FIRST

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:43.642

REGULATIONS ACROSS THE STATE

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.935

TRIES TO SPIN IT THESE PRACTICES

BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAP AND THEY

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:42.527

TO PULL CRUELTY THAT IS A

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:03.141
REGULAR OCCURRENCE ON OFTEN PART

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:04.609
OF STANDARD PRACTICE ON FOR

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:05.343
FARMS.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.644
THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS NO

00:29:06.711 --> 00:29:09.647
SUCH THING AS ETHICAL.

00:29:09.714 --> 00:29:10.515
FOR THIS IS AN INDUSTRY WHERE

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:13.084
BEST CURRENT PRACTICE INVOLVES

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:15.019
KEEPING WILD ANIMALS IN VERY

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:17.088
SMALL CAGES FOR THEIR ENTIRE

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.225
GROUND.

00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:21.226
THIS ENVIRONMENT LEADS TO

00:29:21.292 --> 00:29:22.894
ABNORMAL REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:24.762
SELF MUTILATION AND

00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:26.264
CANNIBALIZING OF CAGE MADE.

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:27.632
THESE BEHAVIORS ARE INDUCED BY

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:31.970
FRUSTRATION REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:33.371
COPE WITH LIFE ON A FOR FARM.

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.439
IT'S ALSO AN UNREFUTED FACT.

00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:36.141
THAT BEST CURRENT PRACTICE

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:37.742
INCLUDES KILLING ANIMALS BY

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:40.145

METHOD FOR SICK OR INJURED

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:52.423
ANIMALS SUCH AS MINK OR FOX IS.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.591
THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT OF ALL

00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:55.360
HOWEVER IS THAT THIS IS

00:29:55.426 --> 00:29:56.828
COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.

00:29:56.895 --> 00:29:58.763
IT'S WHY CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.465

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:51.166
IDENTIFICATION THE DEFINITIONS

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:53.234
TOO EXPANSIVE OR IS THERE WILL

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:54.569
BE A BILL TODAY WHERE THEY CAN

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.705
ARGUE THAT VERY DEFINITION IS

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:58.139
TOO NARROW.

01:22:58.206 --> 01:22:59.574
SO -- ALWAYS.

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:03.278
NIMBLE -- CERTAINLY -- I WANT TO

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.714

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:07.048
DOING THIS.

01:23:07.115 --> 01:23:09.584
THE ISSUE BEFORE US IT REALLY

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.286
DEALS MORE WITH THE PRIVACY.

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:13.388
ISSUE AND YOU'VE TAKEN

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:15.156
AMENDMENTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:17.859
THAT THIS INFORMATION IS USED

01:23:17.926 --> 01:23:19.127
FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE WHICH

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:20.495
IS TO DO PLANNING.

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:23.231
AND NOT TO CONTINUE STOCKING AND

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:25.333
MONITORING PEOPLE SPECIFIC

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.668
BEHAVIOR AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:29.104
THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNED ABOUT

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:32.374
THAT -- THE AND I THINK THAT

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.675
THESE AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:36.745
THAT ISSUE -- AND I THINK THAT

01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:38.279
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.448
DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES WE ARE

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:41.850
REMINDED OF THE PRIVACY.

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.318
THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.486
PRIVACY WE HAVE HERE IN

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:45.553
CALIFORNIA SO.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.455
I AM PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.090
AGREED.

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:50.892
TO THOSE AMENDMENTS -- AND AS I

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:51.659
UNDERSTAND THEIR INTENDED TO

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:53.862
PLACE A FLOOR SO THAT THE

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:55.330
INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BUT

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:56.598
CERTAINLY DON'T FOR CLOSEST

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:57.465
CEILING.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:58.967
THAT WOULD ENSURE SUFFICIENT

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:00.435
DATA IS STILL AVAILABLE THAT'S

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:02.670
THE THAT'S SORT OF THE FIND THE

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:04.139
BALANCE WE'RE LOOKING AT I THINK

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:04.739
THIS.

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:07.642
ACHIEVES THAT SO -- IF THERE ARE

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:10.545
ANY QUESTIONS ANY ANY CONCERNS

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:13.982
CENTER ON SOME -- READY TO MOVE

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:15.483
THE BILL I WAS JUST.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.451
IF I WAS FOLLOWING THE

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:17.318
OPPOSITION EVEN IF IT'S NOT

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:18.453
ADEQUATELY DE IDENTIFIED THAT

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.288
MEANS THAT THE CITY WOULD HAVE

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.190
TO SELL THAT INFORMATION TO A

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.558
THIRD PARTY.

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.193
THAT THEY WOULD USE IT FOR SOME

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.328
SORT OF ECONOMIC GAIN I GUESS

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:28.963
BECAUSE OF THE OR OR THE CITY

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:30.432
WOULD GO AFTER PEOPLE FOR

01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:31.733
OUTSTANDING.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.902
TAXES AND PARKING TICKETS OR

01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:36.538
SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO OF COURSE

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.940
I THINK THEY AMENDMENTS.

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.842
GODDESS THERE IS WITH THE RAISE

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.811
CONCERNS ALL MOVE THE BILL VERY

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:44.846
GOOD END OF NOTING TO THAT --

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.214
THAT IS PART OF THE CONCERN THAT

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:47.515
WILL SEE AND OTHER BILLS WHERE I

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:48.583
THINK THE CHAMBER MAY BE ON THE

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.818
OTHER SIDE OF THAT BUT IT'S

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:52.420
ALWAYS INTERESTING.

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.355
SENATOR TO RAZA YEAH I JUST WANT.

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:55.924
TO REINFORCE I THINK WE'RE BOTH

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:57.425
YOU AND FEDERAL HEALTHCARE ARE

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:58.760
SAYING IS.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.395
WE'RE SORT OF ON THE FLIP SIDE

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:02.597
OF SOME OF THESE BILLS AND I

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:03.665
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:06.067
THINGS THAT I ADVOCATE FOR OUR

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:07.202
CONSISTENT.

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.503
YOU KNOW NO MATTER WHAT THE

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:11.239
ISSUE OR OR THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:11.406
UP.

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:12.907
BUT IT DID.

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:15.543
RAISE THE QUESTION OF HOW WELL

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.879
THIS COULD BE USED AND SO MANY

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:19.681
OF THE OTHER -- BILLS TOUCH ON

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:22.116
THAT IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.452
THE INFORMATION IS NOT USED

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:25.887
AGAINST INDIVIDUALS.

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.822
YOU KNOW FOR VIOLATIONS OF

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:28.723
THINGS THAT THEY COULD BE

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.659
ACCUSED OF AND SO THAT'S WHAT

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:33.795
I'M MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT AND

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:34.529
THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE'S

01:25:34.596 --> 01:25:36.231
ALWAYS CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.799
GET HIT THE HARDEST WHEN IT

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.634
COMES -- TO TO THOSE KINDS OF

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:41.302
THINGS SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:42.871
HEAR FROM YOU WE'RE MOVING IN

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:45.673
THE DIRECTION OF MAKING SURE

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.242
THAT IT IS [inaudible]

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:48.543
NARROW ENOUGH.

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:50.645
THAT WE DON'T OPEN UP THE DOOR

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.547
FOR OTHER USES.

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:53.715
THANK YOU I I APPRECIATE THE

01:25:53.781 --> 01:25:55.250
QUESTION I WOULD SAY FIRST OF

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:56.851
ALL I I DO AGAIN WANT TO THANK

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:58.853
THE COMMITTEE FOR THE AMENDMENTS

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.655
THAT THEY HAVE ADDED TO THE BILL.

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:02.624
WHICH DO REQUIRE THE DATES TO BE

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:03.725
AGGREGATED SO THAT THERE WILL BE

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.326
DATA THAT TELLS THE CITY'S

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:06.995

AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IS

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:12.967
GRANULAR AS THE INFORMATION CAN

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:13.635
GET.

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.837
SO THAT IS VERY PROTECTIVE ALSO

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:17.071
GIVING THEM THE INFORMATION THAT

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.506
WE BELIEVE THEY REALLY NEED AND

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:20.375
WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:23.044

THE DIRECTION -- TO SAY LISTEN

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:29.817
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:31.152
AS FAR TOO BROAD TO BE USEFUL

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:32.186
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:34.055
CITIES NEED TO NOW -- MORE OF

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:35.223
THIS INFORMATION SO THAT THEY

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:36.591
KNOW IF THEY HAVE TRANSIT GAPS

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:38.426
IF THEY NEED TO RUN ADDITIONAL

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:39.994
BUSES HOW THEY CAN REDUCE

01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:41.062
CONGESTION ON THEIR STREET AND

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:42.530
WHAT THE CONGESTION IMPACTS

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:43.531
MIGHT BE A TNC IS THAT ARE

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:44.933
CIRCULATING WAITING.

FOR A SPORTING EVENT AND FOR

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:47.135
INSTANCE THAT THE CITIES HAVE A

01:26:47.201 --> 01:26:48.603
RIGHT TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:50.471
AND THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY IN

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:52.407
DOING THAT WHILE PROTECTING.

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:54.108
THE DATE OF USERS I WOULD ALSO

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.176
SAY THOUGH THAT I THINK THAT

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:56.511
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:57.879
ABOUT THE PRIVACY THAT WE DO

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.047
TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY WE'RE

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.114
GOING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:01.549
CITIES USE DATA.

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.184
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT ON

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:03.985
THE WHOLE AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:05.620
AT SORT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PIECE

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.088
OF IT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OVER

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:07.956
ARCHING SORT OF HOLISTIC

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:09.824
LEGISLATION RATHER THAN

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.392
SUBJECTING EVERY SINGLE BILL. TO

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:12.927
US SORT OF THAT TEST AND THAT'S

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.462
WHAT THE PRIVACY LEGISLATION DID

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.863
LAST YEAR AND I THINK THAT

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:18.433

HOW CITIES AND HOW PUBLIC AT

LEAST USE THAT AND THERE'S A LOT

01:27:26.641 --> 01:27:27.742
OF CONCERN ABOUT HOW PRIVATE

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:28.876
ENTITIES OR USE IT WILL BE

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.678

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:15.242
INTEREST GROUPS THIS IS A VERY

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:16.810
TRICKY ISSUE.

01:40:16.877 --> 01:40:18.846
BECAUSE AS AND AS EMPLOYERS

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:20.614
THERE IS DEFINITELY A GOOD

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:24.651
REASON -- TO BE ABLE TO GET.

01:40:24.718 --> 01:40:26.687
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT ONE'S

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.055
EMPLOYEES AND WE'VE TRIED TO

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:29.823

FOR PURPOSES OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT.

01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:34.928
AND THE THE OTHER COUNTERVAILING

01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:36.864
FACTOR IS THAT WITH SURVEILLANCE

01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:38.799
AS WAS NOTED WE CAN DO A LOT

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:40.868
MORE THAN JUST KNOW WHETHER OR

01:40:40.934 --> 01:40:42.536
NOT AN EMPLOYEE IS GOING OUT TO

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:44.538
LUNCH BETWEEN TWELVE AND ONE WE

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:45.706

WE'RE WHO THEIR MEETING WHAT

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:47.908
THEY'RE EATING.

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:49.676
AND THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:52.413
BECAUSE WE PUT AS EARLY SUNSET --

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:54.415
ON THIS BILL -- IF YOU WILL THAT

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:56.083
THIS WILL BRING THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:57.618
TOGETHER BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS

01:40:57.684 --> 01:40:59.253
REALLY AGAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:01.855
MOVED US WELL BEYOND.

01:41:01.922 --> 01:41:03.490
JUST KNOWING JUST PUNCHING IN.

01:41:03.557 --> 01:41:04.491
SHOES ME PUNCHING IN AND

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.560
PUNCHING OUT THE CLOCK IS A

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:08.462
PERSON TIMELY OR THEY ARE THEY

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:09.763

TAKING MORE.

01:41:12.166 --> 01:41:13.200
THOSE ARE THE ISSUES WE USED TO

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:15.235

WE ALL KNOW IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:32.205
WERE IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST

01:48:32.272 --> 01:48:33.773
HOUSING CRISIS IN STATE HISTORY.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.175
WITH INCREDIBLE HOUSING DEMAND

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:51.791
FAMILIES WERE MAKING THE

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:54.194
IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE EVERY MONTH

01:48:54.261 --> 01:48:55.061
BETWEEN PAIN FOR ROOF OVER THEIR

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:55.962
HEADS.

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:57.464
WORKING FOR BASIC NECESSITIES.

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:59.099
WE'VE ALL READ IN THE PAPERS

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:00.567
THAT ARE HOMELESS POPULATIONS

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.068
ARE INCREASING BY DOUBLE DIGITS

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:04.137
ACROSS THE STATE WITHIN THIS

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:05.071
PAST YEAR.

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:06.673
AN UNCONSCIONABLE FIGURE DRIVEN

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.576
LARGELY BY THE INABILITY OF MANY

01:49:09.643 --> 01:49:11.177
INDIVIDUALS TO PAY THE RENT.

01:49:11.244 --> 01:49:12.679
AND WE HAVE ALL HEARD AND READ

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:14.614
TOO MANY STORIES OF TENANTS

01:49:14.681 --> 01:49:15.548
FACING RAN HIKES.

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:20.520
OF 10% 20% 50% A 100%.

01:49:20.587 --> 01:49:21.321
THIS BILL AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:22.489
IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE

01:49:22.555 --> 01:49:24.824
SOLUTION THERE TO HELP THE BILL.

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:26.092
I'M GONNA SCRIBE HALF OF THE

01:49:26.159 --> 01:49:28.628
BILL GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:29.229
MISTER GRAYSON TO DESCRIBE THE

01:49:29.296 --> 01:49:30.330
SECOND.

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.866
SO FIRST OF ALL OF ONE PART OF

01:49:32.933 --> 01:49:34.834
THE BILL IS AN ANTI RENT GOUGING

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:37.170
POLICY IT IS NOT RENT CONTROL.

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:38.772
IT'S A POLICY DESIGNED TO

01:49:38.838 --> 01:49:40.707
PROTECT MOST OF OUR STATES

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:41.341
FIFTEEN MILLION TENANTS WHO DO

01:49:41.408 --> 01:49:43.610
NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL AGAINST

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:45.845
AGREE JUST RENT INCREASES WHILE

01:49:45.912 --> 01:49:47.447
ALLOWING LANDLORDS TO MAKE A

01:49:47.514 --> 01:49:49.215
FAIR RATE OF RETURN.

01:49:49.282 --> 01:49:50.750
IT'S MODELED AFTER A CALIFORNIA

01:49:50.817 --> 01:49:52.285
LAW THAT IT'S BEEN THE BOOKS FOR

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:53.586
A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS THAT

01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:55.355
HAS PROHIBITED PRICE GOUGING

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:56.022
ABOVE 10%.

01:49:56.089 --> 01:49:57.857
AFTER AN EMERGENCY OR NATURAL

01:49:57.924 --> 01:49:59.225
DISASTER LIKE A FIRE OR AN

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:00.293
EARTHQUAKE.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.028
THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE ANTI

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.096
RENT GOUGING POLICY WOULD

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:05.598
ESTABLISH A CAP ON ANNUAL RENT

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:09.002
INCREASES SET AT 7% PLUS THE

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:10.570
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX INFLATION.

01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:11.871
WHICH IS GENERALLY TWO AND A

01:50:11.938 --> 01:50:15.175
HALF 23% A YEAR FOR A TOTAL OF

01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:16.776
NINE AND A HALF 210% A YEAR.

01:50:16.843 --> 01:50:17.978
OUR BILL WOULD EXEMPT SOME SMALL

01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:19.512
PROPERTY OWNERS TO ENSURE THAT

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:20.613
THEY'RE NOT OVERLY BURDEN IT

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.315
EXEMPTS NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR TEN

01:50:22.382 --> 01:50:24.150
YEARS SO AS TO NOT TO GET IN THE

01:50:24.217 --> 01:50:25.819
WAY OF NEW HOUSING THAT WE

01:50:25.885 --> 01:50:26.486
DESPERATELY NEED.

01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:28.788
AND THIS BILL SUNSETS AND THREE

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.790
YEARS GIVEN US THE CHANCE TO RE

01:50:30.857 --> 01:50:31.791
EVALUATE AT THAT TIME.

01:50:31.858 --> 01:50:33.360
I NOW LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY

I WILL.

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.912
I WOULD CHOOSE PART A OF OF THE

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:54.748
SECOND HALF ANTI GOUGING IS ONE

01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:55.582
SIDE OF THE TENANT PROTECTION

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:57.684
CORNING THE OTHER IS JUST

01:50:57.751 --> 01:50:59.052
BECAUSE THE FICTION.

01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:00.620
AB FORTY NEEDED TO REQUIRES A

01:51:00.687 --> 01:51:02.389

THE WRITTEN NOTICE TO TERMINATE

01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:04.624
A TENDENCY.

01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:06.226
IF THE TENANT HAS OCCUPIED THE

01:51:06.292 --> 01:51:07.560
PROPERTY FOR TWELVE MONTHS OR

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:09.729
MORE THIS IS THE SENATE -- THIS

01:51:09.796 --> 01:51:11.531
ISN'T THIS IS ESSENTIAL.

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:12.632
AS A PROTECTION BECAUSE IT

01:51:12.699 --> 01:51:14.934
GUARANTEES DUE PROCESS OF LAW.

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:16.269
AND GUARDS AGAINST ARBITRARY

01:51:16.336 --> 01:51:18.204
RETALIATORY OR DISCRIMINATORY

01:51:18.271 --> 01:51:20.740
EVICTIONS WHILE IT IS LEGAL FOR

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:22.709
A LANDLORD TO EVICT SOMEONE

01:51:22.776 --> 01:51:24.677
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE IT'S

01:51:24.744 --> 01:51:25.345
ILLEGAL BECAUSE THEY ARE A

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:27.347
MEMBER OF A PROTECTED CLASS A

01:51:27.414 --> 01:51:29.115

HABITABILITY COMPLAINT.

01:51:32.552 --> 01:51:34.687
IT IS LEGAL TO EVICT THEM FOR NO

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:35.889
CAUSE AT ALL.

01:51:35.955 --> 01:51:37.357
IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE A

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:38.691
SITUATION WHICH A LANDLORD

01:51:38.758 --> 01:51:40.460
ACTING IN BAD FAITH COULD USE

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:42.328
THIS LOOPHOLE TO MASK THE

01:51:42.395 --> 01:51:44.597
INTENTION BEHIND A TRULY ILLEGAL

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:45.765
EVICTION.

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:46.866
AND LET'S BE CLEAR THIS BILL

01:51:46.933 --> 01:51:48.668
SIMPLY EXTENDS THE DUE PROCESS

01:51:48.735 --> 01:51:50.703
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE GRANTED TO

01:51:57.477 --> 01:51:59.145
IS THE EXACT STANDARD THAT

01:51:59.212 --> 01:52:00.280
APPLIES TO THE MAJORITY OF

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:02.115
TENANTS IN THE MAJORITY OF

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:03.817
CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:05.118
IF INTENDED FAILS TO PAY RENT

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:06.186

JUST LIKE UNDER EXISTING LAW.

01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:17.931
THIS BILL ONLY COVERS A SPECIFIC

01:52:17.997 --> 01:52:19.699
SITUATION WHERE A LANDLORD

01:52:19.766 --> 01:52:20.733
DECIDES TO REMOVE IT AND AND

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:23.336
CANNOT ARTICULATE A REASON WHY

THEY NEED TO DO SO WE ALL AGREE

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:26.873

OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN A

01:54:00.066 --> 01:54:01.668
ISSUE.

01:54:01.734 --> 01:54:02.902
IN MAY OF THAT YEAR THE PROPERTY

BUT EVEN THOUGH THE NEW LAN OR

HAD INCREASED MY RANT THAT WAS

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.055
NOT ENOUGH.

01:54:22.121 --> 01:54:23.656
THEY WANT TO SELL THE PROPERTY

01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:25.291
AND THEY WANT TO FLIP IT.

01:54:25.358 --> 01:54:26.759
WITHIN TWENTY DAYS THE LANDLORD

SIXTY DAYS.

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:32.232
AT THAT TIME I WAS EXPERIENCING

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:33.700
SEXUAL HARASSMENT MY JOB.

01:54:33.766 --> 01:54:35.001
AND I WAS FIRED FOR FIGHTING AND

01:54:35.068 --> 01:54:38.304
DEFENDING BACK DEFENDING MYSELF.

01:54:38.371 --> 01:54:39.839
EVEN THOSE ABLE TO FIND A JOB

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:41.207
WITHIN A MONTH AND A HALF REYES

01:54:41.274 --> 01:54:42.809
HAD RISEN SO HIGH THAT I CANNOT

01:54:42.875 --> 01:54:44.844
AFFORD A SECURE.

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:45.378
AFFORD A SECURITY DEPOSIT

01:54:45.445 --> 01:54:46.279
ANYWHERE.

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:48.114
MY SON AND I BECAME HOMELESS FOR

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:50.016
THREE YEARS.

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:51.050
WE WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN A SAFE

01:54:51.117 --> 01:54:53.019
AND STABLE CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE

01:54:53.086 --> 01:54:54.921
WE COULDN'T AFFORD ANYTHING MORE.

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:55.855
WOULD MOVE FROM COUCH TO COUCH

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:57.457
BY CONTINUE TO WORK AND STARTED

01:54:57.523 --> 01:54:59.292
UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL AT UC

01:54:59.359 --> 01:55:00.393
BERKELEY.

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.830
IT WAS TRAUMATIZING.

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:04.897
MY SON OF SUFFERS FROM DEEP

01:55:04.964 --> 01:55:06.199
DEPRESSION FROM HAVING

01:55:06.266 --> 01:55:08.234
EXPERIENCED SUCH INSTABILITY SO

01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:09.902
EARLY IN HIS LIFE AND EACH DAY

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:12.472
IS A STRUGGLE FOR HIM.

01:55:12.538 --> 01:55:13.906
IT IS NOT AN OVERSTATEMENT WHEN

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:16.809
I SAY THAT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY

01:55:16.876 --> 01:55:18.444
TWO COULD LITERALLY SAVE LIVES.

01:55:18.511 --> 01:55:19.812
THEY CAN SAY FAMILIES FOR MENTAL

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:21.714
ANGUISH AND DESPAIR.

01:55:21.781 --> 01:55:23.650
IT COULD PROVIDE PHYSICAL SAFETY.

01:55:23.716 --> 01:55:24.784
WE CAN ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO

01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:25.985
GROW UP TO BE THE BEST VERSION

01:55:26.052 --> 01:55:27.387
OF THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE TRAUMA

01:55:27.453 --> 01:55:29.322
OF LOSING A HOME.

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:30.390
IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT RING

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:31.858
DOUSING WE MUST ALSO PROTECT

01:55:31.924 --> 01:55:33.259
FAMILIES ARE BEING ARBITRARILY

01:55:33.326 --> 01:55:34.927
EVICTED WHEN THEY HAVE DONE

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:36.396
NOTHING WRONG.

01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:38.398
HOW'S IT HUMANE THAT WE AS A

01:55:38.464 --> 01:55:39.599

01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:43.569
REASON OTHER THAN PROFIT.

01:55:43.636 --> 01:55:44.837
DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES OF

01:55:49.642 --> 01:55:51.544
LET ALONE THE MENTAL SPIRITUAL

01:55:51.611 --> 01:55:52.912
AND EMOTIONAL COSTS THAT THE

01:55:52.979 --> 01:55:54.580

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:37.055
LET ME FIRST START BY SAYING

02:11:37.122 --> 02:11:37.789
THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

02:11:39.324 --> 02:11:40.259
THING.

02:41:52.402 --> 02:41:53.837
AWAY THE ABILITY TO GET RID OF A

02:41:53.904 --> 02:41:57.441
TENER DOESN'T PAY THE RENT -- TO

02:41:57.507 --> 02:42:00.544
IS A IT SUFFICIENTLY DISRUPTIVE

02:42:00.610 --> 02:42:03.180
OF THE OF THE A HOME IN THE AREA

02:42:03.246 --> 02:42:06.016
IN WHICH THEY'RE LIVING -- THE

02:42:06.083 --> 02:42:07.551

02:42:07.617 --> 02:42:09.853
EXACTLY THE SAME AS ITS EXISTING

02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:11.221
GROUNDS.

02:42:11.288 --> 02:42:12.689
OF FAILURE TO PAY RENT BREACH OF

02:42:12.756 --> 02:42:14.091
LEAST COMMITTING WASTE CAUSING A

02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:14.991
NUISANCE.

02:42:15.058 --> 02:42:16.593
IN OTHER WORDS UNDER THIS BILL

02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:17.794
LANDLORDS WILL.

ABSOLUTELY BE ABLE TO GET RID OF

02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:22.365
BAD TENANTS -- I THINK THE U. AT

02:42:22.432 --> 02:42:25.035
THE EXEMPTIONS ARE PRUDENT SMALL

02:42:25.102 --> 02:42:26.603
TIME MOM AND POP LANDLORDS ARE

02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:28.271
GENERALLY LEFT OUT IN RECENT

02:42:28.338 --> 02:42:30.006
CONSTRUCTION IS ALSO LEFT OUT

02:42:30.073 --> 02:42:30.941
WHICH I THINK.

02:42:31.007 --> 02:42:34.244
ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS ABOUT --

02:42:34.311 --> 02:42:35.679
PEOPLE NOT BUILDING THERE ARE A

02:42:35.745 --> 02:42:37.214
LOT OF REASONS THAT WE'RE NOT

02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:38.815
SEEING MULTI FAMILY.

02:42:38.882 --> 02:42:40.350
HOMES AND APARTMENTS ONE OF THE

02:42:40.417 --> 02:42:42.586
BIGGEST ONES BY THE WAY HAS TO

02:42:42.652 --> 02:42:43.687
DO WITH THE FEDERAL TAX LAW.

02:42:43.753 --> 02:42:48.758
BACK IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN WE

02:42:48.825 --> 02:42:49.960
TOOK AWAY THE X. CELEBRATED

02:42:50.026 --> 02:42:50.827
DEPRECIATION.

02:42:50.894 --> 02:42:51.428
SCHEDULE IT TOOK OUT A HUGE

02:42:51.495 --> 02:42:52.229
AMOUNT OF THE PROFIT THAT

02:42:52.295 --> 02:42:53.630
BUILDERS AND CONSTRUCTION WOULD

02:42:53.697 --> 02:42:56.800
HAVE AND WE SAW A HUGE DROP IN

02:42:56.867 --> 02:42:57.467
THE NUMBER THESE HOMES THAT WERE

02:42:57.534 --> 02:42:58.468
BUILT SO.

02:42:58.535 --> 02:43:00.003
I'M NOT SURE THERE'S ANY ONE

02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:02.372
ISSUE -- BUT THERE ARE SERIES OF

02:43:02.439 --> 02:43:04.407
THEM AND PERHAPS -- WE CAN

02:43:04.474 --> 02:43:06.676
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AT SOME POINT

02:43:06.743 --> 02:43:08.345
BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR BILL TODAY

02:43:08.411 --> 02:43:11.181
SO I I SUPPORT THE BILL I

02:43:11.248 --> 02:43:12.682
APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY.

02:43:12.749 --> 02:43:16.019

02:43:16.086 --> 02:43:17.487
FOR AND CUT YOU OFF BUT WE DO.

02:43:17.554 --> 02:43:19.422
TWO THIRTY AND I'VE GOT NOW

02:43:19.489 --> 02:43:20.023
FORTY FOUR OTHER BILLS THAT WE

02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:21.992
HAVE TO DO BEFORE MIDNIGHT

02:43:22.058 --> 02:43:24.327
TONIGHT I GUESS -- BUT I'D LIKE

02:43:24.394 --> 02:43:25.896
TO OPEN IT UP IF THERE ARE ANY

02:43:25.962 --> 02:43:28.732
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AND THEN --

02:43:28.798 --> 02:43:29.900
WE WILL.

02:43:29.966 --> 02:43:32.903
TAKE A A MOTION IF THAT IS SO --

02:43:32.969 --> 02:43:34.337
DESIRED.

02:43:34.404 --> 02:43:36.673
SENATOR GONZALEZ -- I JUST WANT

02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:37.674
TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

02:43:37.741 --> 02:43:40.410
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- AS

02:43:40.477 --> 02:43:41.745
SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS YOU KNOW

02:43:41.811 --> 02:43:44.347
A LARGE CITY LIKE LONG BEACH --

02:43:44.414 --> 02:43:45.715
TO RIGHT BEFORE I LEFT THE

02:43:45.782 --> 02:43:47.117
COUNCIL BROUGHT FORWARD A

02:43:47.184 --> 02:43:49.419
RELOCATION ASSISTANCE ORDINANCE

02:43:49.486 --> 02:43:50.787
TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS THAT

02:43:50.854 --> 02:43:52.289
WERE IN THE DOWNTOWN LONG BEACH

02:43:52.355 --> 02:43:53.623
AREA BECAUSE WE DID HAVE A LOT

02:43:53.690 --> 02:43:55.025
OF THE INCREASES.

02:43:55.091 --> 02:43:56.459
IN RENTS BECAUSE OF NEW

02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:58.361
DEVELOPMENTS AND MUCH OF THIS

02:43:58.428 --> 02:44:00.297
BILL LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE BILL

02:44:00.363 --> 02:44:01.998
THAT WAS PASSED IN LONG BEACH

02:44:02.065 --> 02:44:04.201
WHICH I APPRECIATE BUT EVEN WITH --

02:44:04.267 --> 02:44:06.136
MORE NARROW RESTRICTIONS AND

02:44:06.203 --> 02:44:07.204
AFTER LOOKING AT THIS BILL I

02:44:07.270 --> 02:44:08.738
MEAN A SIMILAR TO WHAT SENATOR

02:44:08.805 --> 02:44:10.207
JACKSON MENTIONED YOU KNOW THREE

02:44:10.273 --> 02:44:11.608
YEARS SUNSET.

02:44:11.675 --> 02:44:14.411
NO FALL AN AT FAULT --

02:44:14.477 --> 02:44:16.546
INCLUSIONS ADD EXEMPTION ON NEW

02:44:16.613 --> 02:44:19.015
CONSTRUCTION AND ESSENTIALLY --

02:44:19.082 --> 02:44:20.417
OWNERS CAN.

02:44:20.483 --> 02:44:22.719
INCREASE THEIR RENTS BY TWELVE

02:44:22.786 --> 02:44:24.588
HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS.

02:44:24.654 --> 02:44:26.022
WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT STILL IT'S

02:44:26.089 --> 02:44:27.490
IT'S STILL ALLOWABLE WITH THIS

02:44:27.557 --> 02:44:28.458
BILL.

02:44:28.525 --> 02:44:29.392
SO WITH THAT SAID I WILL BE

02:44:29.459 --> 02:44:30.660
SUPPORTING THIS TODAY AND I JUST

02:44:30.727 --> 02:44:32.996

HATE ABOUT THIS BILLS THAT

02:44:39.436 --> 02:44:40.237
OFTENTIMES IT GETS DIVISIVE.

02:44:40.303 --> 02:44:41.371
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS

02:44:41.438 --> 02:44:42.539
ACTUALLY PROTECTS -- RENTERS AND

02:44:42.606 --> 02:44:45.008
ALSO LANDLORDS -- TOO MANY

02:44:45.075 --> 02:44:47.177

02:45:48.571 --> 02:45:49.406
WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

02:45:49.472 --> 02:45:51.608
DO HERE -- BUT IN THE MIDST OF

02:45:51.675 --> 02:45:53.209
THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR

02:45:53.276 --> 02:45:54.477
STATE'S HISTORY OUR TENANTS NEED

02:45:54.544 --> 02:45:56.279

02:45:56.346 --> 02:45:58.581
PROPOSAL THAT BOTH PROTECTS

02:45:58.648 --> 02:46:00.750

02:46:00.817 --> 02:46:01.885

02:46:01.951 --> 02:46:03.420
PROTECTION AGAINST THE MOST

02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:05.188
EGREGIOUS RENT INCREASES WITHOUT

02:46:05.255 --> 02:46:06.756
COMPROMISING THE ABILITY OF

LANDLORDS TO MAKE A HEALTHY

02:46:07.557 --> 02:46:09.793

02:46:18.902 --> 02:46:20.837
THE PERSPECTIVE FROM CA THAT WE

02:46:20.904 --> 02:46:23.173

VIOLATE.

02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:27.344
THESE RULES AND AND AND I THINK

02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:28.778

02:46:28.845 --> 02:46:29.312

03:06:48.730 --> 03:06:49.965
POSSIBLE A COUPLE RIGHTS WERE

03:06:50.032 --> 03:06:52.167

03:07:01.476 --> 03:07:02.511

THOSE WHO LOVED GUINEA PIGS.

03:07:09.451 --> 03:07:10.485
SEEM LIKE AN INNOCENT ENOUGH

03:07:10.552 --> 03:07:11.853

WHEN I WORK FOR A CENTER IN

03:07:35.277 --> 03:07:36.345

03:07:41.984 --> 03:07:42.884
TRYING TO RECRUIT AND FORCE

03:07:42.951 --> 03:07:45.153

03:07:45.220 --> 03:07:46.822
IF THESE KIDS GET SEXUALLY

03:07:46.888 --> 03:07:48.590

GET AN ABORTION BY THEIR

03:07:49.658 --> 03:07:51.360
TRAFFICKER THIS BILL PROTECTS

03:07:51.426 --> 03:07:52.628
THE PREDATOR FROM GETTING FOUND

03:07:52.694 --> 03:07:53.528

03:08:13.081 --> 03:08:13.782
IT SEEMS LIKE THE AUTHOR THIS

03:08:13.849 --> 03:08:16.018
BILL DOESN'T WANT FOSTER PARENTS

03:08:16.084 --> 03:08:17.786

03:08:36.138 --> 03:08:38.907
COMMITTEE ON A PAGE TEN OF THE

03:08:38.974 --> 03:08:40.776
ANALYSIS WE ADDRESS THE THE

03:08:40.842 --> 03:08:43.345
SITUATION WITH PARENTAL BEHAVIOR.

03:08:43.412 --> 03:08:46.214
AND THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS.

03:08:46.281 --> 03:08:48.083
IN OBSERVING THE RIGHTS UNDER

03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:50.318
THIS PROVISION FOSTER PARENTS

03:08:50.385 --> 03:08:51.687
MUST ALSO BE MINDFUL OF THEIR

03:08:51.753 --> 03:08:52.921
DUTY TO MEET.

03:08:52.988 --> 03:08:55.524
THE REASONABLE AND PRUDENT

03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:56.725
PERRANCE STANDARD SO IF

03:08:56.792 --> 03:08:58.660
SOMETHING IS REASONABLE AND

03:08:58.727 --> 03:09:00.462
PRUDENT FOR A PARENT TO DO --

03:09:00.529 --> 03:09:03.265

IS THINGS THAT ARE UNREASONABLE

03:09:04.700 --> 03:09:06.201

03:09:06.268 --> 03:09:07.836
EXAMPLES ARE THINGS THAT ARE

03:09:07.903 --> 03:09:09.438

HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CHILDREN IN

03:09:24.653 --> 03:09:26.588
OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT SO I THINK

03:09:26.655 --> 03:09:28.090
THAT ADDRESSES.

03:09:28.156 --> 03:09:31.493

JUST WANNA STATE REALLY QUICKLY

03:18:52.487 --> 03:18:54.088
THERE THERE HAVE BEEN OVER

03:18:54.155 --> 03:18:55.356
THIRTEEN RESEARCH STUDIES THAT

03:18:55.423 --> 03:18:57.191
FOUND SIGNIFICANT RATES OF UNDER

03:18:57.258 --> 03:18:59.394
TRIAGE BY EMS PERSONNEL RATES AS

03:18:59.460 --> 03:19:00.762
HIGH AS 32%.

03:19:00.828 --> 03:19:02.163
ON THE TRANSPORT OF PATIENTS TO

03:19:02.230 --> 03:19:03.731
ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS AND I

03:19:03.798 --> 03:19:04.766

03:19:04.832 --> 03:19:07.068
PATIENTS WHO CALL 911- OR MORE

03:19:07.135 --> 03:19:09.270
LIKELY TO BE CRITICALLY ILL AND

03:19:09.337 --> 03:19:10.705
ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED.

03:19:10.772 --> 03:19:11.973
THIS IS A MUCH MORE SECURE

03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:14.008
POPULATION OF PATIENTS THAT COME

03:19:14.075 --> 03:19:15.610
BY AMBULANCE AND AT THE END OF

03:19:15.677 --> 03:19:17.812
IT ALL AGAIN WE DO NOT SUPPORT

03:19:17.879 --> 03:19:19.681

IT IN MY OPINION HAVING HAD TO

03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:06.981
GO THROUGH EXPERIENCES WITH LOVE

03:22:07.048 --> 03:22:09.851
ONE'S GOING TO THEIR ILLNESSES

03:22:09.917 --> 03:22:11.219
AND ALL I JUST THINK.

03:22:11.285 --> 03:22:13.187
THE NURSES ARE THE GREATEST OF

03:22:13.254 --> 03:22:15.756
UNSUNG HEROES AS ARE THE EMTS IN

03:22:15.823 --> 03:22:17.058
THE FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE I'VE

HAVE SO -- THESE AMENDMENTS THAT

03:22:23.965 --> 03:22:25.166
WERE TAKING WERE TAKEN IN THE

03:22:25.233 --> 03:22:27.068
HEALTH COMMITTEE I DO HAVE A

03:22:27.134 --> 03:22:28.636
CONCERN THOUGH I HAVE TO DEVIATE

03:22:28.703 --> 03:22:29.904
JUST A LITTLE BIT FROM MY

03:22:29.971 --> 03:22:32.440
CONCERN ABOUT LIABILITY ONLY.

03:22:32.507 --> 03:22:34.609
THE REPORTS THE DATA SHOWING

03:22:34.675 --> 03:22:38.179
THAT DAD -- EMTS MAY HAVE UNDER

03:22:38.246 --> 03:22:40.281

A PEOPLE WITH A AFTER NINE ONE

03:22:50.591 --> 03:22:51.459
ONE CALLS.

03:22:51.526 --> 03:22:53.327
CAN YOU RESPOND TO THE DATA

03:22:53.394 --> 03:22:54.395
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE QUESTION

03:22:54.462 --> 03:22:57.131
OF THE QUESTIONS SAFETY IS

03:22:57.198 --> 03:22:58.232
REALLY PARA MODELING ALL OF US

03:22:58.299 --> 03:22:58.766
AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S A

03:22:58.833 --> 03:23:00.134
QUESTION THAT IS OF PARAMOUNT

03:23:00.201 --> 03:23:02.003
IMPORTANCE TO MY MEMBERS AS WELL.

03:23:02.069 --> 03:23:03.504
AND IF AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

03:23:03.571 --> 03:23:05.606
CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO HAS

03:23:05.673 --> 03:23:06.941
BEEN THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR

03:23:07.008 --> 03:23:08.643
THESE PROGRAMS FOR THE LAST FOUR

03:23:08.709 --> 03:23:09.844
AND A HALF YEARS.

03:23:09.911 --> 03:23:12.346
IF YOU REVIEW EVERY REPORT THEY

03:23:12.413 --> 03:23:13.681
WILL THEY WILL ASSERTIVELY AND

03:23:13.748 --> 03:23:16.250
AFFIRMATIVELY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN

03:23:16.317 --> 03:23:17.952
ZERO ADVERSE PATIENT OUTCOMES.

03:23:18.019 --> 03:23:19.720
THE REASON FOR AUSTIN PILOTS IS

03:23:19.787 --> 03:23:21.355
TO TEST THESE INNOVATIVE MODELS

03:23:21.422 --> 03:23:22.423
AND I THINK THEY'VE PROVEN OUT

03:23:22.490 --> 03:23:23.925
ITS THEY'VE DEMONSTRATED THIS IS

03:23:23.991 --> 03:23:25.226
AN EFFECTIVE MODEL.

03:23:25.293 --> 03:23:26.661
AND WE ARE NOT OPERATING IN THE

03:23:26.727 --> 03:23:28.930
FIELD ABSENT THE DIRECTION OF

03:23:28.996 --> 03:23:31.299
PHYSICIANS THAT'S HOW WE OPERATE

03:23:31.365 --> 03:23:33.134
NOW IS PARAMEDICS WE DO NOT DO A

03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:35.603
SINGLE INTERVENTION IN THE FIELD

03:23:35.670 --> 03:23:36.170
WITHOUT.

03:23:36.237 --> 03:23:38.172
THE EITHER THE STANDING ORDERS

03:23:38.239 --> 03:23:40.441
OR THE ORDER THAT WE RECEIVE WE

03:23:40.508 --> 03:23:42.510
CALL A BASE HOSPITAL IN AN

03:23:42.577 --> 03:23:43.844
EMERGENCY SETTING IN THAT.

03:23:43.911 --> 03:23:46.647
SCENARIO IS UNCHANGED HERE THEY

03:23:46.714 --> 03:23:47.648
HAD ALSO PATIENTS.

03:23:47.715 --> 03:23:49.650
ELECT TO BE TRANSPORTED

03:23:49.717 --> 03:23:51.152
SOMEWHERE ELSE IT IS NOT A

03:23:51.218 --> 03:23:52.820
MANDATORY TRANSPORT SO IF THE

03:23:52.887 --> 03:23:54.422
OPPOSITION WANTS TO COME BACK

03:23:54.488 --> 03:23:56.123
AND RESPOND TO THAT AND THEN I

03:23:56.190 --> 03:23:57.158
PROMISE CENTER WHY BECAUSE HE

03:23:57.224 --> 03:23:58.292
WILL GET BACK TO THE ISSUE AT

03:23:58.359 --> 03:23:58.726
HAND.

03:23:58.793 --> 03:24:01.329
WHICH IS THE LIABILITY ISSUE

03:24:01.395 --> 03:24:02.363
THAT IS WHAT IS BEFORE THIS

03:24:02.430 --> 03:24:04.498
COMMITTEE -- WOULD YOU READ DO

03:24:04.565 --> 03:24:05.399

YOU KNOW THAT'S FINE AND MOM AND

03:24:11.372 --> 03:24:13.407
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE REPORTS THAT --

03:24:13.474 --> 03:24:14.842
MRS MOMMA HAD.

03:24:14.909 --> 03:24:15.876
POINTED TO FOR THE LAST SIX

03:24:15.943 --> 03:24:18.379
YEARS THE ISSUE FOR US IS.

03:24:18.446 --> 03:24:20.748
IN ORDER TO KNOW IF A PROGRAM IS

03:24:20.815 --> 03:24:22.149
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WE HAVE TO

03:24:22.216 --> 03:24:23.551
LOOK AT THE RAW DATA.

03:24:23.618 --> 03:24:25.086
RAW DATA AS YOU ALL KNOW IS THE

03:24:25.152 --> 03:24:27.989
DATA THE WRONG NUMBERSYET

03:24:28.055 --> 03:24:30.124
BY RESEARCHER BEFORE UNDERGOES

03:24:30.191 --> 03:24:32.293
ANY TYPE OF STATE STATISTICAL

03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:33.894
ANALYSIS WE DON'T HAVE THAT SO

03:24:33.961 --> 03:24:36.297
MY QUESTION IS AND WE VAST UCSF

03:24:36.364 --> 03:24:37.531
FOR SIX YEARS WHERE'S THE RAW

03:24:37.598 --> 03:24:40.267
DATA THEY WILL GIVE IT TO US WHY.

03:24:40.334 --> 03:24:41.002
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE

03:24:41.068 --> 03:24:41.969
HIDING WILL BE ON THE RECORD BE

03:24:42.036 --> 03:24:47.541
SET IT WE SENT SEVERAL REPORTS

03:24:47.608 --> 03:24:48.542
OF FOR US.

03:24:48.609 --> 03:24:49.343
AND TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW HOW

03:24:49.410 --> 03:24:50.845
THESE PILOTS HAVE BEEN UNDER USE.

03:24:50.911 --> 03:24:51.612
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR US

03:24:51.679 --> 03:24:52.847
STATE OF NEW MEXICO PULLED OUT

03:24:52.913 --> 03:24:53.814
OF THIS PILOT PROJECT THE END OF

03:24:53.881 --> 03:24:55.216
THE DAY IT DIDN'T SAVE MONEY.

03:24:55.282 --> 03:24:56.751
IT DIDN'T PROVIDE SAFE PATIENT

03:31:39.386 --> 03:31:40.454
NARROWLY TAILORED TO AVOID THAT

03:31:40.521 --> 03:31:41.555

IS EXACTLY WHAT AB FIFTY ONE

03:34:51.111 --> 03:34:52.112
DOES SIMILAR TO THAT.

03:34:52.179 --> 03:34:53.180

FORMED AND YOU CANNOT PUT

03:36:31.311 --> 03:36:33.146
FAIR EFFICIENT MEANS OF

03:36:33.213 --> 03:36:35.382
RESOLVING DISPUTES -- IT IS NOT

03:36:35.449 --> 03:36:36.783
THE SAME AS BRINGING A LAWSUIT

03:36:36.850 --> 03:36:38.185
BUT THE PARTIES INVOLVED GET TO

03:36:38.251 --> 03:36:40.020
RESOLVE THE PROBLEM NEVER THE

03:36:40.087 --> 03:36:41.755
LESS THERE THAN PAT IN FACT BEEN

03:36:41.822 --> 03:36:43.223
EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT SHOW AND

03:36:43.290 --> 03:36:44.925
EMPLOYMENT CASES PLAINTIFFS

03:36:44.991 --> 03:36:46.259
RECEIVE ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT

03:36:46.326 --> 03:36:47.527
AN ARBITRATION THAT THEY WOULD

03:36:47.594 --> 03:36:49.162
IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BUT IN.

03:36:49.229 --> 03:36:50.731
FACT FEEL LIKE THEY'VE GOTTEN TO

03:36:50.797 --> 03:36:52.199
LIKE HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT

03:36:52.265 --> 03:36:53.934
EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T ACTUALLY

03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:55.969
COURT -- THAT CHAMBER

03:36:56.036 --> 03:36:58.038
ARTICULATED THAT VERY VALID

03:36:58.105 --> 03:36:59.906
CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL BEING --

03:36:59.973 --> 03:37:02.275
IN -- PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW

03:37:02.342 --> 03:37:04.378
BUT WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH

03:37:04.444 --> 03:37:06.046
THE IDEA THAT ARBITRATION IS

03:37:06.113 --> 03:37:09.416
LESSER OR UNFAIR JUST AS THANK

03:37:09.483 --> 03:37:10.751

IF IF THIS IS SUCH A GREAT

03:37:44.017 --> 03:37:46.219
SYSTEM THAT EMPLOYEES WOULD OPT

03:37:46.286 --> 03:37:47.554
INTO IT.

03:37:47.621 --> 03:37:49.856
SO -- I SORT OF THINK RETHINK

03:37:49.923 --> 03:37:52.259

IDENTIFY THAT -- THESE -- WERE

03:38:03.270 --> 03:38:05.372
NULL AND VOID THE THE THE

03:38:05.439 --> 03:38:06.606
POSITION AGAIN SORRY I WONDER IF

03:38:06.673 --> 03:38:07.374
YOU COULD.

03:38:07.441 --> 03:38:08.809
COMMENT ON THAT AND AS FAR AS

03:38:08.875 --> 03:38:10.744
DYNAMIX GOES I DON'T THINK THIS

03:38:10.811 --> 03:38:12.646
IS A DYNAMIC SITUATION AT ALL

03:38:12.712 --> 03:38:14.948
BUT IF YOU WOULD.

03:38:15.015 --> 03:38:16.650
TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR

03:38:16.716 --> 03:38:20.053
PROBLEM ABOUT PREEMPTION -- THIS

03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:21.855
THIS LAW WAS SPECIFICALLY

03:38:21.922 --> 03:38:23.390
WRITTEN IN ORDER TO AVOID

03:38:23.457 --> 03:38:25.325
PREEMPTION THE ONLY -- CONDITION

03:38:25.392 --> 03:38:26.126
WERE SETTING IS THAT IT'S

03:38:26.193 --> 03:38:27.561
VOLUNTARY AND LAST I CHECKED AND

03:38:27.627 --> 03:38:29.429
LAW SCHOOL A CONTRACT SHOULD BE

03:38:29.496 --> 03:38:31.264
ENTERED INTO VOLUNTARILY -- IT

03:38:31.331 --> 03:38:33.600
DOES NOT SAY THAT A WORKER

03:38:33.667 --> 03:38:35.135
CANNOT SIGN AN ARBITRATION

03:38:35.202 --> 03:38:36.803
AGREEMENT IT DOES NOT SAY WHAT

03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:38.939
HAS TO BE OR CANNOT BE AN

03:38:39.005 --> 03:38:40.507
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT UNLIKE THE

03:38:40.574 --> 03:38:42.042
NEW YORK LAW WHICH SPECIFICALLY

03:38:42.108 --> 03:38:43.276
SAID IT COULDN'T COVER SEXUAL

03:38:43.343 --> 03:38:44.077
HARASSMENT.

03:38:44.144 --> 03:38:45.078
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE

03:38:45.145 --> 03:38:46.146
KEPT OUR IS VERY BROAD IT JUST

03:38:46.213 --> 03:38:48.315
SAYS THAT IT HAS TO IT CANNOT BE

03:38:48.381 --> 03:38:50.484
I'M FORCED UPON A WORKERS A

03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:52.953
CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT -- WE

03:38:53.019 --> 03:38:54.054
THINK THAT'S NARROWLY TAILORED

03:38:54.120 --> 03:38:57.290
WE PASSED A LOT OF BILLS IN THIS --

03:38:57.357 --> 03:38:59.326
IN THIS HOUSE TO TAKE ON AT

03:38:59.392 --> 03:39:01.795
MISGUIDED FEDERAL AT LEAST AND

03:39:01.862 --> 03:39:04.264
SO AM I OF COURSE THIS WILL BE

03:39:04.331 --> 03:39:05.332
LITIGATED THERE'S NO QUESTION

03:39:05.398 --> 03:39:06.533
ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK WE WILL

03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:10.504
PREVAIL AND I THINK I WORKERS

03:39:10.570 --> 03:39:11.104
WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE OF IT.

03:39:11.171 --> 03:39:12.005
THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER

03:39:12.072 --> 03:39:13.707
QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO THROW IN I

03:39:13.773 --> 03:39:15.108
THINK I IT HAD ASKED FOR THIS

03:39:15.175 --> 03:39:16.109
ONCE BEFORE IF THERE ARE

03:39:16.176 --> 03:39:18.111
AMENDMENTS I WOULD LIE TO JOIN

03:39:18.178 --> 03:39:20.614
IN I THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL

03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:21.581
SYSTEM.

03:39:21.648 --> 03:39:22.983
SHOULD ALLOW CHOICE --

03:39:23.049 --> 03:39:27.754
ARBITRATIONS ARE -- BASICALLY.

03:39:27.821 --> 03:39:30.123
A SET FORTH WHERE ONE DOESN'T

03:39:30.190 --> 03:39:31.992
GET TO EXERCISE WHAT I THINK IS

03:39:32.058 --> 03:39:33.660
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO GO

03:39:33.727 --> 03:39:35.929
TO COURT -- AND SO I AM

03:39:35.996 --> 03:39:37.397
INHERENTLY OPPOSED TO THEM I

03:39:37.464 --> 03:39:39.332
KNOW THAT -- AS I MENTIONED AT

03:39:39.399 --> 03:39:41.034
THE LAST HEARING BY BEEN

03:39:41.101 --> 03:39:42.736
OVERRULED BY THE SUPREME COURT

03:39:42.802 --> 03:39:44.271
WHOEVER THOSE FOLKS ARE.

03:39:44.337 --> 03:39:47.941
AND BUT I THINK THAT -- OF AS WE

03:39:48.008 --> 03:39:49.209
LOOK AT THIS ISSUE MORE

03:39:49.276 --> 03:39:51.244
CAREFULLY THE REALLY PEOPLE

03:39:51.311 --> 03:39:51.912
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT WHETHER OR

03:39:51.978 --> 03:39:55.515
NOT. TO TO AGREE TO ARBITRATION

03:39:55.582 --> 03:39:57.384
TO AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS --

03:39:57.450 --> 03:39:58.385
TO REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES IN A

03:39:58.451 --> 03:40:00.520
COURT OF LAW -- AND I AND I

03:40:00.587 --> 03:40:02.255
APPRECIATE THE THE BALANCING

03:40:02.322 --> 03:40:03.857
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IT MAY BE

03:40:03.924 --> 03:40:05.358
IT MAY BE BY THIS COURT THAT'S

03:40:05.425 --> 03:40:08.595
BEEN SO LOADED WITH ANTI.

03:40:08.662 --> 03:40:10.564
YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE.

03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:12.832
GEN JUSTICES THAT UP.

03:40:12.899 --> 03:40:14.801
MAYBE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE

03:40:14.868 --> 03:40:17.437
SUPPORTED ALTHOUGH I IT'S MY

03:40:17.504 --> 03:40:19.005
HOPE THAT IF WE KEEP ON PUSHING

03:40:19.072 --> 03:40:21.474
WILL ACTUALLY GET BACK OUR

03:40:21.541 --> 03:40:22.542
RIGHTS.

03:40:22.609 --> 03:40:23.076
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR OWN

03:40:23.143 --> 03:40:24.277
CHOICES AND WHETHER OR NOT WE

03:40:24.344 --> 03:40:25.579
WANT TO LITIGATE OR ARBITRATE

03:40:25.645 --> 03:40:27.080
THAT SHOULD BE THE CHOICE AN

03:40:27.147 --> 03:40:28.515
INDIVIDUAL HAS HIM PERHAPS.

03:40:28.582 --> 03:40:30.917
IF THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM IS

03:40:30.984 --> 03:40:33.153
THAT GREAT THE IT WILL GET MORE

03:40:33.219 --> 03:40:35.488
BUSINESS THAN THE LEGAL SYSTEM

03:40:35.555 --> 03:40:38.592
BUT RIGHT NOW -- TO FORCE PEOPLE

INTO ARBITRATION LIKE I JUST.

03:40:40.427 --> 03:40:41.861
I DON'T SEE IT I I CANNOT

03:40:41.928 --> 03:40:44.030
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD EVER

03:40:44.097 --> 03:40:46.099
BE CONSIDERED CONSTITUTIONAL BUT

03:40:46.166 --> 03:40:48.168
APPARENTLY IT HAS MAYBE HAVE TO

03:40:48.234 --> 03:40:48.902
GO BACK AND READ ALL THE CASES

03:40:48.969 --> 03:40:50.870

TENSION ONLY LAST YEAR IT'S

03:41:50.864 --> 03:41:51.831
INTERESTING TO HEAR THE CHAMBER

03:41:51.898 --> 03:41:53.600
THIS YEAR BECAUSE I THINK THAT

03:41:53.667 --> 03:41:55.135
THEY WERE TRYING TO GET US JUST

03:41:55.201 --> 03:41:56.803

03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:57.971
LAST YEAR WHEN THEY CARED MORE

ARBITRATION DOES -- BUT IN AND

03:42:08.181 --> 03:42:09.516

THROUGH LITIGATION OR LABOR

03:42:18.358 --> 03:42:22.128
COMMISSIONER AND SO THAT'S WHAT

03:42:22.195 --> 03:42:22.729

04:22:36.207 --> 04:22:37.641
OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW.

04:22:37.708 --> 04:22:38.976
INCLUDING SOME MINIMAL

04:22:39.043 --> 04:22:40.411
SAFEGUARDS AND ASSURANCES THAT

04:22:40.478 --> 04:22:42.847
STUDENTS FULLY UNDERSTAND THE

04:22:42.913 --> 04:22:44.849
RULES ADOPTED BY THE DISTRICT.

04:22:44.915 --> 04:22:46.283
AS IN ALICE'S POINTS OUT THESE

04:22:46.350 --> 04:22:47.284
AMENDMENTS WILL GIVE DISTRICTS

04:22:47.351 --> 04:22:49.120
GREATER CERTAINTY ABOUT THE

04:22:49.186 --> 04:22:49.620
SCOPE OF THEIR POTENTIAL

04:22:49.687 --> 04:22:50.488
LIABILITY.

04:22:50.554 --> 04:22:52.089
PROVIDE MORE CLARITY TO THE

04:22:52.156 --> 04:22:53.591
PUBLIC IN AFFECTED STUDENTS THAT

04:22:53.657 --> 04:22:54.959
PREVENT UNNECESSARY COSTLY

04:22:55.025 --> 04:22:56.594
LITIGATION.

04:22:56.660 --> 04:22:57.595
I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE TO

04:22:57.661 --> 04:22:58.863
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL IS

04:22:58.929 --> 04:23:00.297
ASKING COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BE

04:23:00.364 --> 04:23:01.465
MORE THAN THEY EVER HAVE ADD TO

04:23:01.532 --> 04:23:02.933
IN THE PAST.

04:23:03.000 --> 04:23:04.368
BUT WE ARE AT A SITUATION IN

04:23:04.435 --> 04:23:06.270
CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ALL HAVE TO

04:23:06.337 --> 04:23:07.171
DO MORE THAN WE'VE EVER DONE

04:23:07.238 --> 04:23:08.939
BEFORE.

04:23:09.006 --> 04:23:10.407
LET ME BE CLEAR.

04:23:10.474 --> 04:23:12.176
AB THREE OR TWO IS NOTHING TO

04:23:12.243 --> 04:23:12.810
CELEBRATE.

04:23:12.877 --> 04:23:14.211
IT'S SAD.

04:23:14.278 --> 04:23:15.012
THE FACT THAT WE'RE EVEN

04:23:15.079 --> 04:23:16.413
DISCUSSING THIS IS A REFLECTION

04:23:16.480 --> 04:23:18.182
OF CALIFORNIA'S FAILURE OVER THE

04:23:18.249 --> 04:23:19.717
LAST THIRTY YEARS TO BUILD THE

04:23:19.783 --> 04:23:21.152
HOUSING NECESSARY TO MEET THE

04:23:21.218 --> 04:23:21.852
NEEDS.

04:23:21.919 --> 04:23:23.988
OF OUR GROWING POPULATION.

04:23:24.054 --> 04:23:25.422
BUT WE CAN'T LOOK AWAY OR V<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u>

04:23:25.489 --> 04:23:26.724
THIS ISSUE JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES

04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:28.259
US FEEL AWKWARD.

04:23:28.325 --> 04:23:29.860
THE REALITY IS THAT STUDENTS ARE

04:23:29.927 --> 04:23:31.428
SLEEPING IN THEIR VEHICLES OR

04:23:31.495 --> 04:23:32.196
EVEN OUT ON THE STREET.

04:23:32.263 --> 04:23:33.764
TONIGHT.

04:23:33.831 --> 04:23:35.266
AND WHEN WE DON'T TO PROVIDE A

04:23:35.332 --> 04:23:36.634
SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO SLEEP.

04:23:36.700 --> 04:23:38.302
OR WE OPPOSE A SHORT TERM

04:23:38.369 --> 04:23:39.770
SOLUTION LIKE A. B. THREE OR TWO

04:23:39.837 --> 04:23:41.305
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE

04:23:41.372 --> 04:23:42.606
ENTIRE HOUSING CRISIS.

04:23:42.673 --> 04:23:44.175
WE FORCE THE STUDENTS TO STAY IN

04:23:44.241 --> 04:23:46.043
THE SHADOWS AND DARK ALLEYS AND

04:23:46.110 --> 04:23:47.978
INDUSTRIAL PARKS WHERE THEY ARE

04:23:48.045 --> 04:23:49.780
MOST VULNERABLE.

04:23:49.847 --> 04:23:51.682
AB THREE OR TWO IS NOT A

04:23:51.749 --> 04:23:52.249
SOLUTION TO THE HOMELESSNESS

04:23:52.316 --> 04:23:55.786
CRISIS BUILDING MORE HOUSING IS.

04:23:55.853 --> 04:23:57.288
BUT THAT WILL TAKE YEARS THEN IN

04:23:57.354 --> 04:23:58.422
THE MEANTIME THERE ARE HUNDREDS

04:23:58.489 --> 04:23:59.456
OF THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITY

04:23:59.523 --> 04:24:00.958

04:24:02.626 --> 04:24:03.460
TONIGHT.

04:24:03.527 --> 04:24:04.528
AND WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE

04:24:04.595 --> 04:24:05.429
CAN TO MAKE THEIR SITUATION A

04:24:05.496 --> 04:24:07.598
LITTLE BETTER.

04:24:07.665 --> 04:24:08.365
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

04:24:08.432 --> 04:24:09.833

FORCED TO LIVE OUT OF MY CAR

THINK ANYBODY IS THINKS THIS IS

04:36:12.422 --> 04:36:13.556

THIS IS A STOPGAP MEASURE SO --

04:36:16.993 --> 04:36:18.395
I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

04:36:18.461 --> 04:36:20.397
HERE IS TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD

04:36:20.463 --> 04:36:21.531
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE

04:36:21.598 --> 04:36:24.367

PROGRAMME.

04:36:33.410 --> 04:36:34.678
FOR IS IT NOW FIFTEEN YEARS JUST

04:36:34.744 --> 04:36:36.713
FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY ACTUALLY

04:36:36.780 --> 04:36:39.449
BUT ANYWAY THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM

04:36:39.516 --> 04:36:41.952
WITH GETTING OLD -- OF THE

04:36:42.018 --> 04:36:44.421
PROGRAM WORKS AND WHEN IT'S DONE

04:36:44.487 --> 04:36:48.358
PROPERLY THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY.

04:36:48.425 --> 04:36:49.326
ANY COMPLAINTS THERE HAVEN'T

04:36:49.392 --> 04:36:53.229
BEEN ANY YEAH LAWSUITS FILED SO --

04:36:53.296 --> 04:36:54.531
I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE IS

04:36:54.597 --> 04:36:56.066
A TEMPLATE THERE IS AN EXAMPLE

04:36:56.132 --> 04:36:58.535
THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I

04:36:58.601 --> 04:37:00.070
REALIZED THAT THEIR JOB IS TO

04:37:00.136 --> 04:37:02.038
EDUCATE BUT AT THIS POINT IN

04:37:02.105 --> 04:37:03.139
TIME.

04:37:03.206 --> 04:37:04.240
I'M REMINDED THAT THERE ARE SO

04:37:04.307 --> 04:37:05.976
MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE LITERALLY

04:37:06.042 --> 04:37:08.011
NO WHERE TO GO AND IN FACT WITH

04:37:08.078 --> 04:37:09.746
THE FOOD PANTRIES THAT WE'RE

04:37:09.813 --> 04:37:11.314
SEEING IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

04:37:11.381 --> 04:37:12.816
WE HAVE WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO

04:37:12.882 --> 04:37:14.651
HAVE NO FOOD AND NO PLACE TO

04:37:14.718 --> 04:37:16.686
LIVE THAT IS JUST NOT THE WAY

04:37:16.753 --> 04:37:18.121
SOCIETY SHOULD OPERATE.

04:37:18.188 --> 04:37:19.823
AND WHILE I HOPE WE'RE FINALLY

04:37:19.889 --> 04:37:21.625
STARTING TO ADDRESS THAT I THINK

04:37:21.691 --> 04:37:23.560
WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN TERMS OF

04:37:23.626 --> 04:37:25.195
THE LIABILITY.

04:37:25.261 --> 04:37:30.300
I ISSUES ARE -- I THINK AGAIN

04:37:30.367 --> 04:37:31.668
WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH THE THE

04:37:31.735 --> 04:37:34.104
NEGLIGENCE STANDARD -- WE'RE NOT

04:37:34.170 --> 04:37:36.606
ASKING MORE I THINK THAN JUST

04:37:36.673 --> 04:37:38.341
THE BASIC RESPONSIBILITIES THAT

04:37:38.408 --> 04:37:40.210
WERE A SCHOOL WOULD HAVE DURING

04:37:40.276 --> 04:37:41.611
THE SCHOOL DAY.

04:37:41.678 --> 04:37:44.647
SO -- I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE

04:37:44.714 --> 04:37:47.283
DONE AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING

04:37:47.350 --> 04:37:49.486
THE BILL A CENTER Y. CASKEY.

04:37:49.552 --> 04:37:52.288
S. MY QUESTION WAS IS THAT THE

04:37:52.355 --> 04:37:54.657
LIABILITY EXIST ALREADY ON THE

04:37:54.724 --> 04:37:56.326
SCHOOLS HAVE SOME BAD THING

04:37:56.393 --> 04:37:57.894
HAPPENS WITH THE SCHOOL AND I

04:37:57.961 --> 04:38:00.730
UNDERSTAND BY HAVING MORE.

04:38:00.797 --> 04:38:02.532
STUDENTS ON CAMPUS THROUGH THE

04:38:02.599 --> 04:38:04.734
NIGHT THAT WOULD INCREASE THE

04:38:04.801 --> 04:38:07.404
RISK OF SOMETHING HAPPEN BUT IS

04:38:07.470 --> 04:38:08.204
THERE SOMETHING [inaudible]

04:38:08.271 --> 04:38:09.205
EN.

04:38:09.272 --> 04:38:11.007
IS GIVEN THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE

04:38:11.074 --> 04:38:12.675
AUTHORS TAKEN THAT WE GIVE

04:38:12.742 --> 04:38:14.144
NOTICE TO THE STUDENTS THAT THEY

04:38:14.210 --> 04:38:16.880
CAN ENSURE SAFETY WE HAD MINIMUM

04:38:16.946 --> 04:38:18.181
SAFEGUARDS.

04:38:18.248 --> 04:38:19.749
SO THAT THE STUDENTS.

04:38:19.816 --> 04:38:21.818
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S

04:38:21.885 --> 04:38:23.119
THE WHAT THE RULES BEEN ADOPTED

04:38:23.186 --> 04:38:24.721
WE GET IF THEY'RE BAD ACTORS

04:38:24.788 --> 04:38:26.389
SAID DRINKING AND DOING THAT

04:38:26.456 --> 04:38:29.426
THEY'RE OUT -- I DON'T KNOW IF

04:38:29.492 --> 04:38:30.026
THERE WERE OTHER THINGS WITHIN

04:38:30.093 --> 04:38:33.763
THE THE POLICY THE SELF INSURE

04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:35.098
POLICIES THAT THEY HAVE WOULD BE

04:38:35.165 --> 04:38:38.935
OTHER CRITERIA THAT WOULD --

04:38:39.002 --> 04:38:40.937
LIMIT THAT LIABILITY OR FOR

04:38:41.004 --> 04:38:42.405
PROVIDE.

04:38:42.472 --> 04:38:44.140
MORE KNOWLEDGE TO THE STUDENTS

04:38:44.207 --> 04:38:45.542
AND BEHAVIORS THAT ARE

04:38:45.608 --> 04:38:47.010
ACCEPTABLE OR NOT -- BECAUSE

04:38:47.077 --> 04:38:48.978
I'VE I SEE THIS IS IS AN

04:38:49.045 --> 04:38:50.947
EXTENSION OF LIMITED LIABILITY

04:38:51.014 --> 04:38:52.449
IF YOU ALREADY HAVE NOT CREATING

04:38:52.515 --> 04:38:54.317
ANY NEW RIGHTS AND MAYBE I'M

04:38:54.384 --> 04:38:56.386
WRONG.

04:38:56.453 --> 04:38:57.754
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL

04:38:57.821 --> 04:38:59.823
I I'D IF IF WE'RE WRONG THAT I'D

04:38:59.889 --> 04:39:01.224
LOVE TO HEAR IT FROM FOLKS AND

04:39:01.291 --> 04:39:02.358
IF PEOPLE HAVE ANY OTHER

04:39:02.425 --> 04:39:03.593
SUGGESTIONS.

04:39:03.660 --> 04:39:04.461
THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE WE'VE

04:39:04.527 --> 04:39:05.728
TAKEN A LOT OF AMENDMENTS TO

04:39:05.795 --> 04:39:06.830
THIS BILL AND EVERY STEP OF THE

04:39:06.896 --> 04:39:07.664
PROCESS.

04:39:07.730 --> 04:39:09.332
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE MORE IF

04:39:09.399 --> 04:39:11.201
WE THINK THAT THEY'RE VALID IN

04:39:11.267 --> 04:39:13.369
ADDRESS VALID CONCERNS.

04:39:13.436 --> 04:39:14.704
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE GIVE

04:39:14.771 --> 04:39:18.141
THEM A LITTLE EXTRA PROTECTION

04:39:18.208 --> 04:39:19.909
THE UNIVERSE OF THE COLLEGES.

04:39:19.976 --> 04:39:23.346
THAT -- WERE EXTENDING THE WORLD

04:39:23.413 --> 04:39:25.215
WE'RE GIVING THEM A MUNITY FROM

04:39:25.281 --> 04:39:27.750
ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE OF THERAPY

04:39:27.817 --> 04:39:28.751
IF THEY'RE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH

04:39:28.818 --> 04:39:30.186
NO SOMETIMES YOU JUST DON'T KNOW

04:39:30.253 --> 04:39:31.254
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IF

04:39:31.321 --> 04:39:33.022
THEY'RE TAKING ALL THE NECESSARY

04:39:33.089 --> 04:39:35.658
STEPS -- AND THERE ARE A NUMBER

04:39:35.725 --> 04:39:37.360
OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. TO

04:39:37.427 --> 04:39:40.096
PROTECT THE STUDENTS WHILE

04:39:40.163 --> 04:39:42.599
THEY'RE ASLEEP.

04:39:42.665 --> 04:39:44.634
ON CAMPUS IN THEIR CARS.

04:39:44.701 --> 04:39:46.369
IS THE WHOLE NOTION ACCIONES

04:39:46.436 --> 04:39:48.071
STITCHES THIS IS HARD TO IMAGINE

04:39:48.138 --> 04:39:49.405
BUT THEY GET TO GIVE ME A LITTLE

04:39:49.472 --> 04:39:52.275
IMMUNITY -- AS AN INCENTIVE I

04:39:52.342 --> 04:39:53.843
KNOW NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE MORE

04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:55.778
RESPONSIBILITY AND NOBODY WANTS

04:39:55.845 --> 04:39:57.981
OF THOSE LIABILITIES SO THIS IS

04:39:58.047 --> 04:39:59.215
A WAY TO SORT OF GIVE.

04:39:59.282 --> 04:40:03.353
SOME -- ASSURANCES THAT IF YOU

04:40:03.419 --> 04:40:05.522
JUST ACT IN GOOD FAITH AND DO

04:40:05.588 --> 04:40:07.891
THE BEST YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY --

04:40:07.957 --> 04:40:09.192
THAT THERE WILL BE THEIR

04:40:09.259 --> 04:40:11.995
PROTECTION THE REGION'S THERE'S

04:40:12.061 --> 04:40:13.696
THEIR EMPLOYEES [inaudible]

04:40:13.763 --> 04:40:14.531
OKAY.

04:40:14.597 --> 04:40:15.665
UNDER THE RAZA [inaudible]

04:40:15.732 --> 04:40:16.399
YEAH.

04:40:16.466 --> 04:40:22.305
WE WERE THAT.

04:40:22.372 --> 04:40:23.006
THE CENTER.

04:40:23.072 --> 04:40:24.507
IT OBVIOUSLY IS VERY BOTHERS

04:40:24.574 --> 04:40:26.276
SOME THAT.

04:40:26.342 --> 04:40:27.777
OUR SCHOOLS ARE.

04:40:27.844 --> 04:40:29.612
BUT NOW HAVE THIS AS A

04:40:29.679 --> 04:40:32.148
RESPONSIBILITY THAT THESE

04:40:32.215 --> 04:40:33.850
CONDITIONS WOULD EXIST.

04:40:33.917 --> 04:40:36.019
FOR STUDENTS -- AND IT'S

04:40:36.085 --> 04:40:37.620
INTERESTING ARCHER SAID FIFTEEN

04:40:37.687 --> 04:40:40.590
YEARS AGO WELL PROGRAM STARTED

04:40:40.657 --> 04:40:43.126
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO -- I THINK

04:40:43.193 --> 04:40:45.428
THAT THE THINKING BEHIND THIS

04:40:45.495 --> 04:40:47.130
OUGHT TO BE.

04:40:47.197 --> 04:40:49.799
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE TEN TO

04:40:49.866 --> 04:40:51.134
FIFTEEN YEARS WHAT WOULD YOU DO.

04:40:51.201 --> 04:40:52.936
IN A CASE WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO

04:40:53.002 --> 04:40:54.604
PLAN FOR TEN TOFIFTEEN YEARS I

04:40:54.671 --> 04:40:55.772
DO NOT SEE.

04:40:55.838 --> 04:40:58.374
ANYTHING.

04:40:58.441 --> 04:40:59.475
THAT IS GOING TO LESSEN THAT

04:40:59.542 --> 04:41:00.910
LENGTH OF TIME [inaudible]

04:41:00.977 --> 04:41:03.479
UNLESS.

04:41:03.546 --> 04:41:04.948
WE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

04:41:05.014 --> 04:41:06.883
LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE MAKE IT

04:41:06.950 --> 04:41:07.183
[inaudible]

04:41:07.250 --> 04:41:10.186
OF SIMILAR TO A WILDFIRE

04:41:10.253 --> 04:41:10.486
[inaudible]

04:41:10.553 --> 04:41:12.488
EMERGENCY.

04:41:12.555 --> 04:41:13.790
IF WE DON'T TREAT A THAT THAT

04:41:13.856 --> 04:41:15.558
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS. FIVE

04:41:15.625 --> 04:41:17.827
TEN FIFTEEN YEARS.

04:41:17.894 --> 04:41:19.429
SO WHAT.

04:41:19.495 --> 04:41:21.164
WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT IS

04:41:21.231 --> 04:41:22.799
THAT LOOK LIKE AS FAR AS

04:41:22.865 --> 04:41:25.068
LIABILITY -- I DON'T KNOW WHEN

04:41:25.134 --> 04:41:27.437
YOU SAY IMMUNITIES WHO'S.

04:41:27.503 --> 04:41:29.138
THAT MEANS.

04:41:29.205 --> 04:41:30.873
THE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE RIGHTS

04:41:30.940 --> 04:41:34.944
AS FAR AS SUING THEM IN THE

04:41:35.011 --> 04:41:36.846
STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A RIGHT OF

04:41:36.913 --> 04:41:37.513
PRIVATE ACTION DOESN'T MEAN THEY

04:41:37.580 --> 04:41:39.249
DON'T I MEAN WHAT WHAT DOES THAT

04:41:39.315 --> 04:41:41.918
MEAN IMMUNITY WHO'S GIVING.

04:41:41.985 --> 04:41:43.519
WHO WHAT?

04:41:43.586 --> 04:41:48.391
IS THE STUDENTS THAT WILL BE THE

04:41:48.458 --> 04:41:49.225
ONE TO BEAR WHATEVER.

04:41:49.292 --> 04:41:51.961
THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN THERE

04:41:52.028 --> 04:41:53.162
OF COURSE IT'S THEM THE

04:41:53.229 --> 04:41:54.597
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHOOL WHO

04:41:54.664 --> 04:41:56.099
CARES ABOUT.

04:41:56.165 --> 04:41:57.367
THE STUDENTS.

04:41:57.433 --> 04:41:59.102
SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHEN YOU

04:41:59.168 --> 04:42:01.571
REFER TO THE LIABILITY OR MUNITY

04:42:01.638 --> 04:42:04.173
ISSUES WHOSE TAKE WHAT IS THAT

04:42:04.240 --> 04:42:05.375
TAKE CARE OF SO.

04:42:05.441 --> 04:42:07.710
WHO IS PROTECTED AND THAT YOU

04:42:07.777 --> 04:42:08.544
KNOW AS FAR AS THE

04:42:08.611 --> 04:42:09.979
ADMINISTRATION'S CONCERN AND

04:42:10.046 --> 04:42:11.547
WHOSE PROTECTED AS FAR AS?

04:42:11.614 --> 04:42:12.915
THE STUDENTS ARE CONCERNED

04:42:12.982 --> 04:42:14.484
THAT'S ONE QUESTION ON THE OTHER

04:42:14.550 --> 04:42:18.021
QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF OF

04:42:18.087 --> 04:42:19.722
FAMILY MEMBERS OF STUDENTS.

04:42:19.789 --> 04:42:21.491
I SUSPECT THAT THERE ARE A LOT

04:42:21.557 --> 04:42:23.793
OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE FAMILIES

04:42:23.860 --> 04:42:25.862
THAT THEY UNFORTUNATELY LIVE

04:42:25.929 --> 04:42:27.597
WITH THEM IN THE CARDS AND

04:42:27.664 --> 04:42:28.831
SOMEWHERE ANOTHER.

04:42:28.898 --> 04:42:30.767
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW AN ADDITIONAL

04:42:30.833 --> 04:42:31.701
ISSUE.

04:42:31.768 --> 04:42:34.270
SO I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY IS.

04:42:34.337 --> 04:42:36.039
THAT ALL THESE HAVE TO BE TAKEN

04:42:36.105 --> 04:42:40.576
INTO ACCOUNT SO THAT WE DON'T --

04:42:40.643 --> 04:42:42.845
UNFAIRLY PUT SOMETHING ON OUR

04:42:42.912 --> 04:42:45.114
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT HAVE

04:42:45.181 --> 04:42:47.450
NEVER DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE SO.

04:42:47.517 --> 04:42:48.851
YOU KNOW THE TIME OF COURSE

04:42:48.918 --> 04:42:49.819
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

04:42:49.886 --> 04:42:51.254
RESOURCES TO DO THIS IN THE

04:42:51.321 --> 04:42:52.288
RIGHT WAY.

04:42:52.355 --> 04:42:54.624
NOBODY WANTS TO JUST OPEN IT UP

04:42:54.691 --> 04:42:55.758
IN.

04:42:55.825 --> 04:42:57.360
YOU KNOW AND THINGS HAPPEN BAD

04:42:57.427 --> 04:42:58.961
THINGS COULD HAPPEN SO WE WANT

04:42:59.028 --> 04:43:00.863
TO MAKE SURE IN DOING THIS THAT

04:43:00.930 --> 04:43:02.565
IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY.

04:43:02.632 --> 04:43:03.499
HAVING ASKED ALL THOSE QUESTIONS

04:43:03.566 --> 04:43:05.868
IT I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE ANSWERS

04:43:05.935 --> 04:43:07.637
TO OF COURSE I FEEL COMPELLED TO

04:43:07.704 --> 04:43:09.405
SUPPORT IT THIS IS NOT A A

04:43:09.472 --> 04:43:10.973
CHOICE THAT WE HAVE.

04:43:11.040 --> 04:43:12.508
IT'S A MATTER OF HOW ARE WE

04:43:12.575 --> 04:43:13.676
GOING TO DO THIS.

04:43:13.743 --> 04:43:15.945
SO THAT THOSE STUDENTS AND THEIR

04:43:16.012 --> 04:43:18.748
FAMILIES ARE PROTECTED IN THE

04:43:18.815 --> 04:43:19.849
RIGHT WAY.

04:43:19.916 --> 04:43:21.551
AND ARE WE READY HOW DO WE

04:43:21.617 --> 04:43:23.286
PREPARE AND GET READY FOR THAT.

04:43:23.353 --> 04:43:25.221
THANK YOU KNOW IF I MAY DIRECT

04:43:25.288 --> 04:43:27.724

THE ANALYSIS AND TALKS ABOUT

04:43:28.991 --> 04:43:29.892
THIS.

04:43:29.959 --> 04:43:31.461
THE SERIES OF AMENDMENTS THAT

04:43:31.527 --> 04:43:33.329
WERE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE

04:43:33.396 --> 04:43:35.798
LIABILITY ISSUE -- ITEM DE SAYS

04:43:35.865 --> 04:43:37.300
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

04:43:37.367 --> 04:43:38.835
THAT IS IMPLEMENTED OVERNIGHT

04:43:38.901 --> 04:43:40.370
PARKING THAT COMPLIES WITH THE

04:43:40.436 --> 04:43:41.838
REQUIREMENTS.

04:43:41.904 --> 04:43:43.539
OF SUBDIVISIONS BEING SEE IN

04:43:43.606 --> 04:43:44.207
THOSE ARE THE BASICS THAT WE'RE

04:43:44.273 --> 04:43:46.609
SETTING UP IS NOT CIVILLY LIABLE

04:43:46.676 --> 04:43:47.877
FOR DISTRICT EMPLOYEES GOOD

04:43:47.944 --> 04:43:50.113
FAITH ACT OR OMISSION.

04:43:50.179 --> 04:43:51.681
THAT FAILS TO PRESENT A TO

04:43:51.748 --> 04:43:52.882
PREVENT ANY INJURY TO A

04:43:52.949 --> 04:43:54.784
PARTICIPATING STUDENT THAT

04:43:54.851 --> 04:43:57.553
OCCURS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO WIN

04:43:57.620 --> 04:43:59.122
DURING THE HOURS OF OPERATION.

04:43:59.188 --> 04:44:00.623
OF OVERNIGHT PARKING BUT THIS

04:44:00.690 --> 04:44:02.759
COMMUNITY DOES NOT APPLY TO

04:44:02.825 --> 04:44:04.627
GROSS NEGLIGENCE INTENTIONAL

04:44:04.694 --> 04:44:07.330
MISCONDUCT OR VIOLATIONS OF

04:44:07.397 --> 04:44:08.865
OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW.

04:44:08.931 --> 04:44:10.767
SO WE BASICALLY TAKEN AWAY THE

04:44:10.833 --> 04:44:12.969
NEGLIGENCE STANDARD IF THEY

04:44:13.036 --> 04:44:15.538
PARTICIPATE AND I'M A BASICALLY

04:44:15.605 --> 04:44:17.640

04:44:17.707 --> 04:44:19.175
IT'S A LESSER STANDARD NO

04:44:19.242 --> 04:44:19.876
QUESTION.

04:44:19.942 --> 04:44:22.245
BUT SO LONG AS THEY ARE ACTING

04:44:22.311 --> 04:44:24.046
IN GOOD FAITH AND COMPLYING WITH

04:44:24.113 --> 04:44:26.015
THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

04:44:26.082 --> 04:44:27.984
SET FORTH IN THE BILL -- TO ON

04:44:28.050 --> 04:44:32.989
COVERAGE AND TO ALLOW FOR THIS.

04:44:33.055 --> 04:44:34.590

HOUSING -- THERE THEY HAVE THAT

04:44:35.925 --> 04:44:36.793

CONSIDER MYSELF -- AND AND I

04:44:48.971 --> 04:44:49.972
THINK YOU KNOW THIS DOES MEAN

04:44:50.039 --> 04:44:51.274
THAT STUDENTS ARE YOU KNOW WILL

04:44:51.340 --> 04:44:53.509
NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUE.

04:44:53.576 --> 04:44:55.077
FOR THESE IS SOMETHING THAT

04:44:55.144 --> 04:44:57.046
MIGHT HAPPEN I I WOULD THINK

04:44:57.113 --> 04:44:57.980
FROM THE STUDENTS PERSPECTIVE

04:44:58.047 --> 04:44:59.615
INTO SO YOU CAN SPEAK MORE TO

04:44:59.682 --> 04:45:00.683

04:55:54.169 --> 04:55:55.737
AS MORE MORE BAD ACTORS TRY TO

CHALLENGING WITH THE INVENTION

04:56:22.297 --> 04:56:23.432
OF PROLIFERATION OF NEW

04:56:23.499 --> 04:56:25.601
TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS DEEP FAKES

04:56:25.667 --> 04:56:27.002

SOMETHING THEY DID NOT SAY OR DO

IS FALSE THAT NEVER HAPPENED

04:56:42.684 --> 04:56:44.086
MAKES DEEP FACE A POWERFUL AND

04:56:44.153 --> 04:56:45.287
DANGEROUS NEW TOOL IN THE

04:56:45.354 --> 04:56:46.522
ARSENAL OF THOSE.

04:56:46.588 --> 04:56:48.490

04:56:48.557 --> 04:56:49.658
CAMPAIGNS.

04:56:49.725 --> 04:56:50.926

ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

04:57:07.309 --> 04:57:08.677
THIS IS THE NEW FRONTIER IN THE

04:57:08.744 --> 04:57:10.712
MISINFORMATION WAR.

05:01:09.718 --> 05:01:12.053
THAT IT IS NOW CONSTITUTIONAL

05:01:12.120 --> 05:01:13.588
CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT ISSUE SO

INTENT OF THE BILL FAR FROM IT

05:01:57.299 --> 05:01:58.266
WE AGREE THAT.

05:01:58.333 --> 05:01:59.434
PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF

05:02:03.405 --> 05:02:04.906
THAT DEPICTS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE

05:02:04.973 --> 05:02:06.608
PUT TO HOWEVER WE DON'T BELIEVE

05:02:06.675 --> 05:02:08.844
AB SEVEN THIRTY IS THE SOLUTION.

05:02:08.910 --> 05:02:11.012
THOUGH WELL INTENTIONED AB SEVEN

05:02:11.079 --> 05:02:11.847
THIRTY UNDERMINES THE FIRST

05:02:11.913 --> 05:02:13.515
AMENDMENT AS IT'S OVER BROAD

05:02:13.582 --> 05:02:15.417
INEFFECTIVE AND UNNECESSARY THE

05:02:15.484 --> 05:02:16.585
BILL'S OVER BROAD.

05:02:16.651 --> 05:02:18.053
BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO ANY IMAGE

05:02:18.119 --> 05:02:19.387
OR RECORDING THAT'S BEEN

05:02:19.454 --> 05:02:21.656
MANIPULATED -- AND AS STATED IN

05:02:21.723 --> 05:02:23.124
THE AMENDMENTS SO THAT A

05:02:23.191 --> 05:02:24.559
REASONABLE PERSON WOULD HAVE A

05:02:24.626 --> 05:02:25.961
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF THE

05:02:26.027 --> 05:02:27.796
EXPRESSIVE CONTENT AS COMPARED

05:02:27.863 --> 05:02:29.097
TO THE ORIGINAL.

05:02:29.164 --> 05:02:30.398
THIS COULD APPLY TO A WHOLE HOST

05:02:30.465 --> 05:02:32.267
OF LEGITIMATE PROTECTED FORMS OF

05:02:32.334 --> 05:02:34.336
EXPRESSION FOR EXAMPLE.

05:02:34.402 --> 05:02:36.171
CONSIDER A POLITICAL

05:02:36.238 --> 05:02:37.873
ADVERTISEMENT THAT ATTACKS A

05:02:37.939 --> 05:02:39.508
CANDIDATE FOR MISSING VOTES THAT

05:02:39.574 --> 05:02:41.009
INCLUDES AN IMAGE OF THE

05:02:41.076 --> 05:02:43.712
CANDIDATES WHICH THEY'VE ADDED --

05:02:43.778 --> 05:02:44.980
A GOLF BAG CONTINUE IN THE

05:02:45.046 --> 05:02:46.348
PERSON MISTER VOTES BECAUSE THEY

05:02:46.414 --> 05:02:48.049
WERE GOLFING.

05:02:48.116 --> 05:02:48.984
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

05:02:49.050 --> 05:02:51.086
COVERED BY THIS BILL EVEN IF

05:02:51.152 --> 05:02:52.087
THEY CAN'T IT WAS IN FACT

05:02:52.153 --> 05:02:54.289
GOLFING.

05:02:54.356 --> 05:02:55.090
THE BILL'S INEFFECTIVE A

05:02:55.156 --> 05:02:56.958
PROVIDES NO GUARANTEE OF

05:02:57.025 --> 05:02:58.527

AN ELECTION AND AS NOTED IN THE

05:03:00.028 --> 05:03:00.996
NOW SAYS.

05:03:01.062 --> 05:03:02.297
EVEN IN THE EVENT OF COURT

05:03:02.364 --> 05:03:03.665
ISSUED A RULING BEFORE THE

05:03:03.732 --> 05:03:05.166
ELECTION THAT'S UNLIKELY THE

05:03:05.233 --> 05:03:06.201
STOP THE SPREAD OF THESE

05:03:06.268 --> 05:03:07.602
RECORDINGS ON THE DARK CORNERS

05:03:07.669 --> 05:03:08.904
OF THE INTERNET.

05:03:08.970 --> 05:03:10.038
AND EVEN IF THE BILL WORKS AS

05:03:10.105 --> 05:03:11.973
INTENDED IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT

05:03:12.040 --> 05:03:12.908
LABELING SOMETHING IS

05:03:12.974 --> 05:03:14.876
MANIPULATED GIVES LEAVES VOTERS

05:03:14.943 --> 05:03:16.177
BETTER INFORMED.

05:03:16.244 --> 05:03:17.946
AND PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS

05:03:18.013 --> 05:03:20.415
WHERE THE MANIPULATION HAS BEEN

05:03:20.482 --> 05:03:22.584
MINOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT

05:03:22.651 --> 05:03:24.719
MATERIAL -- IT COULD ACTUALLY

05:03:24.786 --> 05:03:25.854
LEAVE THE VOTER WITH A

05:03:25.921 --> 05:03:28.290
MISIMPRESSION AS TO WHAT IS REAL

05:03:28.356 --> 05:03:30.492
AND NOT REAL IN THAT -- IMAGE OR

05:03:30.559 --> 05:03:32.694
RECORDING.

05:03:32.761 --> 05:03:34.729
FINELY THE THE BILL IS

05:03:34.796 --> 05:03:36.398
UNNECESSARY DEEP FAKES ARE AN

05:03:36.464 --> 05:03:38.433
OLD PROBLEM IN NEW CLOTHES THIS

05:03:38.500 --> 05:03:40.569

OF MY NAME'S MARK POWERS AND

05:03:46.408 --> 05:03:47.475
REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA

05:03:47.542 --> 05:03:49.411
BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION THE

05:03:49.477 --> 05:03:50.912
RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS

05:03:50.979 --> 05:03:52.247
SERVING YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

05:03:52.314 --> 05:03:53.515
AS I SAID ELECTIONS COMMITTEE

05:03:53.582 --> 05:03:55.083
LAST WEEK A FEDERAL LAW

05:03:55.150 --> 05:03:57.719
PROVENCHER BROADCASTERS FROM

05:03:57.786 --> 05:03:58.887
COMPLYING WITH THIS BILL.

05:03:58.954 --> 05:04:00.355
WE APPRECIATE THAT THE ANALYSIS

05:04:00.422 --> 05:04:01.690
HAS LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THAT

05:04:01.756 --> 05:04:03.491
PROBLEM AND WE WERE HOPING TO BE

05:04:03.558 --> 05:04:04.826
ABLE TO BE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL

05:04:04.893 --> 05:04:06.227
BUT IT DOESN'T RESOLVE SOME OF

05:04:06.294 --> 05:04:09.297
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE.

05:04:09.364 --> 05:04:10.098
IN ADDITION TO WHAT -- WHITNEY

05:04:10.165 --> 05:04:12.367
SAID WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW

05:04:12.434 --> 05:04:14.636
THE ACTUAL PROCESS OVERSEE SHINS

05:04:14.703 --> 05:04:17.872
REMOVING DEEP FAKES IS GOING TO

05:04:17.939 --> 05:04:18.773
WORK.

05:04:18.840 --> 05:04:19.574
WHERE THERE MAY BE NO WAY TO

05:04:19.641 --> 05:04:20.308
DETECT THEM?

05:04:20.375 --> 05:04:21.943
AND THE TIME FRAME IS SO SHORT.

05:04:22.010 --> 05:04:24.112
IT SEEMS WE'RE GOING TO COUNT ON

05:04:24.179 --> 05:04:25.714
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO

05:04:25.780 --> 05:04:27.282
PRIORITIZE THESE CASES AND A

05:04:27.349 --> 05:04:29.351
JUDGE TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION

05:04:29.417 --> 05:04:31.519
IF THE PICTURE AUDIO OR VISUAL

05:04:31.586 --> 05:04:32.520
IS FATE.

05:04:32.587 --> 05:04:35.256
AT THAT POINT SOMEONE SOMEWHERE

05:04:35.323 --> 05:04:37.425
SOMEHOW AS GOING TO PROVIDE THE

05:04:37.492 --> 05:04:38.994
MEDIA IN YOUR DISTRICT WITH THE

05:04:39.060 --> 05:04:40.829
RULING SO THEY KNOW IT'S FAKE

05:04:40.895 --> 05:04:41.763
HOPEFULLY.

05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:43.031
BUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

05:04:43.098 --> 05:04:45.000
PUNISH THE MEDIA IF THEY SHOULD

05:04:45.066 --> 05:04:45.934
HAVE KNOWN.

05:04:46.001 --> 05:04:47.602
NOT JUST KNOWN BUT SHOULD HAVE

05:04:47.669 --> 05:04:48.703
KNOWN.

05:04:48.770 --> 05:04:50.505
ABOUT REQUIRES ACTUAL MALICE BY

05:04:50.572 --> 05:04:52.974
EVERYONE ELSE THIS PLACE IS THE

05:04:53.041 --> 05:04:54.442
MEDIAN THE POSITION OF A JUDGE.

05:04:54.509 --> 05:04:56.044
AND A JURY AND THAT WILL HAND

05:04:56.111 --> 05:04:57.445
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND

05:04:57.512 --> 05:04:58.913
ADDITIONAL TACTIC TO TRY AND

05:04:58.980 --> 05:05:01.149
FORCE ADS OFF THE AIR BY

05:05:01.216 --> 05:05:02.017
THREATENING LITIGATION.

05:05:02.083 --> 05:05:04.185
A DEEP THINK IS MOST LIKELY TO

05:05:04.252 --> 05:05:05.487
HAPPEN WITH THIRD PARTY ADS

05:05:05.553 --> 05:05:07.389
PROBABLY FROM OUT OF STATE

05:05:07.455 --> 05:05:08.223
COMMITTEES.

05:05:08.289 --> 05:05:09.958
SO WHEN YOUR STATIONS PUT A

05:05:10.025 --> 05:05:12.293
DISCLAIMER ON AN AD TO AVOID THE

05:05:12.360 --> 05:05:14.295
AB SEVEN THIRTY PENALTIES AFTER

COMMITTEE COMPLAINS ABOUT.

05:05:17.499 --> 05:05:18.733
AND IF THAT STATION GUESSES

05:05:18.800 --> 05:05:21.369
WRONG AFTER THAT DISCLOSURE THEY

05:05:21.436 --> 05:05:24.205
GET A DEFAMATION SUIT.

05:05:24.272 --> 05:05:25.407
AS A REWARD.

05:05:25.473 --> 05:05:25.974
THESE COMMITTEES WON'T CARE

05:05:26.041 --> 05:05:27.342
ABOUT A REASONABLE FEES AS A

05:05:27.409 --> 05:05:28.843
DETERRENT FOR FALSE CLAIMS

05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:30.779
BECAUSE THEY WILL BE GONE.

05:05:30.845 --> 05:05:32.347

WITH MOVING FORWARD ON SOMETHING

05:07:54.589 --> 05:07:58.893

05:08:07.502 --> 05:08:08.770
DANGEROUS THING WITHOUT HAVING

FOR SOMETHING IN WHICH I STILL

05:08:41.369 --> 05:08:43.771
FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH.

05:08:43.838 --> 05:08:46.140
AND JUST BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT

05:08:46.207 --> 05:08:47.375
TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH

05:08:47.442 --> 05:08:49.510
SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE

05:08:49.577 --> 05:08:51.012

SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT -- IN

05:09:02.257 --> 05:09:04.425
IN IN AMERICA AND AMERICAN

05:09:04.492 --> 05:09:06.461
DEMOCRACY IS NOT ABSOLUTE -- AND

05:09:06.527 --> 05:09:07.929
AND IT DOESN'T APPLY THERE ARE

05:09:07.996 --> 05:09:09.464
EXCEPTIONS TO IT.

05:09:09.530 --> 05:09:10.932
I THINK WE'VE NEARLY TAYLOR THE

05:09:10.999 --> 05:09:13.468
BILL TO TO FIT THAT SWEET SPOT --

05:09:13.534 --> 05:09:15.003
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE

05:09:15.069 --> 05:09:16.271
WORK THAT WE STILL NEED TO DO TO

05:09:16.337 --> 05:09:17.605
MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR AND

05:09:17.672 --> 05:09:19.207

THIS I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHEN WE

05:09:27.782 --> 05:09:28.416

05:09:28.483 --> 05:09:29.317
BUT I WOULD JUST GONNA TARGET

05:09:29.384 --> 05:09:30.652
DEEP FAKES THAT WOULD AT LEAST

05:09:30.718 --> 05:09:36.791
BE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT AS

05:09:36.858 --> 05:09:37.992
THE SAME NEGATIVE.

05:09:38.059 --> 05:09:40.561
IMPACTS -- AND IS THE SAME IN MY

05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:42.530

IT YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT IT'S

05:09:52.540 --> 05:09:55.910

05:09:55.977 --> 05:09:58.179
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS BEFORE

05:09:58.246 --> 05:09:59.614
TWENTY TWENTY I DO NOT WANT TO

05:09:59.681 --> 05:10:00.515

BETWEEN GENERIC AND BRAND.

05:34:19.839 --> 05:34:21.374
MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO DELAY

DRUG FOR SOMETHING OF VALUE.

05:34:25.645 --> 05:34:26.746
AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR DOES THIS

05:34:26.813 --> 05:34:28.181
BY ESTABLISHING THE STANDARD

05:34:28.248 --> 05:34:29.382
REVIEW FOR THE COURTS TO USE

05:34:31.251 --> 05:34:32.452
DELAY AGREEMENTS.

05:34:32.519 --> 05:34:34.187
THE FTC HAS SOUGHT TO USE THEIR

AUTHORITY THROUGH ENFORCEMENT TO

05:34:35.588 --> 05:34:36.790

05:34:36.856 --> 05:34:37.724
AGREEMENTS.

05:34:37.791 --> 05:34:39.659
BUT AS LONG AS TEN YEARS AGO

05:34:39.726 --> 05:34:40.827
THEY CALLED ON CONGRESS TO ENACT

05:34:40.894 --> 05:34:42.495
LEGISLATION TO STOP THESE TYPES

05:34:42.562 --> 05:34:43.463
OF AGREEMENTS.

05:34:43.530 --> 05:34:44.964
SO FAR CONGRESS HAS FAILED TO

05:34:45.031 --> 05:34:47.400
ACT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE

05:34:47.467 --> 05:34:48.535
THAT IN CALIFORNIA.

05:34:48.601 --> 05:34:50.103
THE INCREASED COST OF ANTI

05:34:50.170 --> 05:34:51.304
COMPETITIVE AGREEMENTS AFFECTS

05:34:51.371 --> 05:34:52.272
EVERYONE WHO PAYS FOR

05:34:52.338 --> 05:34:54.407
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THE STATE.

05:34:54.474 --> 05:34:57.710
EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMERS THE BILL

05:34:57.777 --> 05:34:59.045
ESTABLISHES.

05:34:59.112 --> 05:35:00.880
A PRESUMPTION THAT THESE

05:35:00.947 --> 05:35:02.348
AGREEMENTS ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE.

05:35:02.415 --> 05:35:04.117
THE DRUNK UP DRUG COMPANIES WILL

05:35:04.184 --> 05:35:05.385
HAVE THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT

05:35:05.452 --> 05:35:06.586
THESE SETTLEMENTS ARE PRO

05:35:06.653 --> 05:35:07.821
CONSUMER.

05:35:07.887 --> 05:35:09.556
OR PRO COMPETITIVE THAT'S

05:35:09.622 --> 05:35:10.523
IMPORTANT BECAUSE UNDER THE

05:35:10.590 --> 05:35:12.425
CURRENT PROCESS IT IT HAS BEEN

05:35:12.492 --> 05:35:14.060
DIFFICULT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO

05:35:14.127 --> 05:35:15.428
ACQUIRE THE INFORMATION FROM THE

05:35:15.495 --> 05:35:17.030
DRUG COMPANIES TO MAKE THIS

05:35:17.096 --> 05:35:18.264
DETERMINATION.

05:35:18.331 --> 05:35:18.998
YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE

05:35:19.065 --> 05:35:20.567
OPPOSITION THAT THESE AGREEMENTS

05:35:20.633 --> 05:35:21.868
ARE POTENTIALLY BRING.

05:35:21.935 --> 05:35:23.903
UP A GENERIC DRUG TO MARKET

05:35:23.970 --> 05:35:26.005
SOONER BUT IS IT REALLY ALWAYS

05:35:26.072 --> 05:35:26.606
IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE

05:35:26.673 --> 05:35:27.674
CONSUMER.

05:35:27.740 --> 05:35:29.175
I'VE ASKED FOR EXAMPLES FROM THE

05:35:29.242 --> 05:35:30.777
INDUSTRY AND THUS FAR HAVE THEY

05:35:30.844 --> 05:35:32.312
HAVE NOT PRODUCED A SINGLE ONE

05:35:32.378 --> 05:35:34.681
THAT ILLUSTRATES THE AGREEMENT

05:35:34.747 --> 05:35:35.582
IS PRO COMPETITIVE.

05:35:35.648 --> 05:35:36.983
YOU'LL LIKELY HEAR FROM OF

05:35:37.050 --> 05:35:38.351
REPRESENTATIVE FROM FARMER TODAY

05:35:38.418 --> 05:35:39.252
AND REPRESENTING FROM THE

05:35:39.319 --> 05:35:41.354
GENERICS BOTH ARGUING AGAINST

05:35:41.421 --> 05:35:43.323
THE BILL AND YOU MIGHT FIND

05:35:43.389 --> 05:35:44.591
YOURSELF SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD.

05:35:44.657 --> 05:35:45.525
SURELY THERE MUST BE A LOSER

05:35:45.592 --> 05:35:47.727
HERE I WOULD CONTEND IT'S THE

05:35:47.794 --> 05:35:48.595
CONSUMER.

05:35:48.661 --> 05:35:49.696
IMAGINE FOR YOURSELF THAT A

05:35:49.762 --> 05:35:51.498
BRAND NAME DRUG MANUFACTURER

05:35:51.564 --> 05:35:52.699
ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT WHERE

05:35:52.765 --> 05:35:54.701
GENERIC CAN GAIN ENTRY TO THE

05:35:54.767 --> 05:35:55.902
MARKET SOONER THAN THE

05:35:55.969 --> 05:35:57.370
EXPIRATION OF THE PATENT.

05:35:57.437 --> 05:35:58.471
AND USUALLY THAT'S NOT THE

05:35:58.538 --> 05:36:00.974
ORIGINAL PATTEN IT'S A SECONDARY

05:36:01.040 --> 05:36:02.408
ONE FOR TERTIARY ONE OR ONE THIS

05:36:02.475 --> 05:36:03.176
BEEN GOING ON THAT WERE

SOMETHING HAS BEEN EVERGREEN FOR

05:36:05.345 --> 05:36:07.380
MANY YEARS SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD

05:36:07.447 --> 05:36:08.348
RIGHT.

05:36:08.414 --> 05:36:09.082
WELL NOW THE DEAL MIGHT LOOK

05:36:09.148 --> 05:36:10.850
LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE

05:36:10.917 --> 05:36:11.784
BRAND NAME MANUFACTURER COULD

SAY MAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS ON

05:36:12.986 --> 05:36:14.621
THE PRESCRIPTION.

05:36:14.687 --> 05:36:15.955
RECOGNIZING THAT ONCE THE

05:36:19.158 --> 05:36:19.826
FIVE DOLLARS.

05:36:19.893 --> 05:36:21.861
THE BRANDING COULD OFFER TO

05:36:21.928 --> 05:36:23.530
ALLOW EARLY ENTRY AT THE GENERIC

05:36:23.596 --> 05:36:25.431

05:36:28.935 --> 05:36:31.037
THAN THE TYPICAL COMPETITION

05:36:31.104 --> 05:36:31.671
MIGHT ALLOW.

05:36:31.738 --> 05:36:33.873
THE BRAND NAME WITH WINS BY

SEEM TO BE VALID?

05:46:01.774 --> 05:46:03.409
THE PATENT SYSTEM ALLOWS A BRAND

SETTLEMENT OF PATENT LITIGATION

05:46:28.300 --> 05:46:30.469
THAT COULD BE ILLEGAL UNDER THIS

05:46:30.536 --> 05:46:32.238

NO TRIVIAL MATTER. FOR A DRUG

05:46:40.246 --> 05:46:41.714

ALL THE NFL TEAMS COMBINED.

05:46:44.650 --> 05:46:46.519
AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR PRESUMES

05:46:46.585 --> 05:46:48.787
THAT MOST OF THE PRO PATIENT PRO

COMPETITIVE PATENT LITIGATION

05:46:50.723 --> 05:46:52.091
SETTLEMENTS WOULD BE ILLEGAL.

05:46:52.158 --> 05:46:53.526
BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF THEM

05:46:53.592 --> 05:46:55.694

BANKRUPTCY LAW.

06:15:10.821 --> 06:15:12.923

YOU COULD PROBABLY.

06:15:54.598 --> 06:15:56.000
YOU COULD PROBABLY GO IN AND

06:15:56.066 --> 06:15:57.334
JUST TERMINATE.

06:15:57.401 --> 06:15:58.869
GET IT DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL

06:15:58.936 --> 06:16:00.871

MODERN DAY -- BUT IT'S IT'S

06:16:03.774 --> 06:16:05.209
SOMETIMES WE NEED TO REFLECT ON

06:16:05.276 --> 06:16:07.378
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AT THIRTY

06:16:07.444 --> 06:16:09.013
SIX I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT

06:16:10.781 --> 06:16:12.983
THIS GAME FOR AWHILE TO KNOW

06:16:13.050 --> 06:16:14.485
THAT WE'RE LOSING SO I'D.

06:16:14.551 --> 06:16:15.386
SORRY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I

I COULD ASK YOU WHAT THE USE RE

06:16:19.490 --> 06:16:21.525
RATE IS BUT I GUESS BY DEFAULT

06:16:21.592 --> 06:16:24.828
COULD BE 36% -- UNDER UNDER THIS

06:16:24.895 --> 06:16:25.996
SOMEBODY'S GONNA MAKE THAT

06:16:26.063 --> 06:16:28.999

THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS ARE.

06:16:36.774 --> 06:16:39.677
I AGREE A THE THE NOTION OF 36%

06:16:39.743 --> 06:16:41.845
IS JUST MIND BOGGLING AND YET

06:16:41.912 --> 06:16:45.516
THAT IS A COMPROMISE THE

06:16:45.582 --> 06:16:48.585
110021003100% -- IS IS.

06:16:48.652 --> 06:16:50.754
MIND BOGGLING LEE UNCONSCIONABLE

06:16:50.821 --> 06:16:52.489
I TRIED TO DO THIS LEGISLATION

06:16:52.556 --> 06:16:54.058
TWENTY YEARS AGO SO THANK YOU

06:16:54.124 --> 06:16:55.192
FOR BRINGING IT YOU'VE MOVED A

06:16:55.259 --> 06:16:56.961
LOT FARTHER THAN I WAS ABLE TO

06:16:57.027 --> 06:16:58.228
DO WITH THE PAYDAY LENDING

06:16:58.295 --> 06:16:59.163
INDUSTRY.

06:16:59.229 --> 06:17:00.931
BEING INCREDIBLY POWERFUL BUT I

06:17:00.998 --> 06:17:03.734
THINK AS YOU SEE HOW THIS SIMPLY

06:17:03.801 --> 06:17:05.002
BERRIES PEOPLE.

06:17:05.069 --> 06:17:06.603
THEY NEED TO BORROW MONEY FOR ON

06:17:06.670 --> 06:17:08.839
A ONE TIME BASIS AND THEY NEVER

06:17:08.906 --> 06:17:11.241
GET OUT OF THE WHOLE.

06:17:11.308 --> 06:17:13.243
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WILL

06:17:13.310 --> 06:17:16.380
TRY TO DO AND WITH THAT -- IF

06:17:16.447 --> 06:17:17.881
YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU

06:17:17.948 --> 06:17:20.150
AND I THINK YOU HAVE ALL HIT

06:17:20.217 --> 06:17:22.386
MANY POINTS -- THAT RELATE TO

06:17:22.453 --> 06:17:23.554
THIS BILL IN THE HISTORY OF THIS

06:17:23.620 --> 06:17:25.322
BILL -- AND TO OUR CALIFORNIA

06:17:25.389 --> 06:17:27.725
SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY SAID

06:17:27.791 --> 06:17:29.560
THAT THESE RICH LOANS AND

06:17:29.626 --> 06:17:31.195
PRODUCTS WERE UNCONSCIONABLE AND

06:17:31.261 --> 06:17:32.563
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT

06:17:32.629 --> 06:17:34.365
RATE WAS AND SO THEY KIND OF

06:17:34.431 --> 06:17:35.933
LOOK TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO

06:17:36.000 --> 06:17:37.634
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT RIGHT RATE

06:17:37.701 --> 06:17:39.803
IS AND WHERE WE GOT THAT RAID IS --

06:17:39.870 --> 06:17:41.205
FROM A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE IT'S

06:17:41.271 --> 06:17:42.940
BEEN TESTED -- IN IN THIS

06:17:43.007 --> 06:17:44.842
COUNTRY THERE ARE OTHER STATES

06:17:44.908 --> 06:17:47.978
WITH THAT RATE SECONDLY AT THE

06:17:48.045 --> 06:17:49.313
MILITARY LENDING ACT.

06:17:49.380 --> 06:17:51.015
ALLOWS FOR ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE

06:17:51.081 --> 06:17:52.583
MILITARY ONCE THEY DISCLOSE ARE

06:17:52.649 --> 06:17:53.917
ACTIVE MEMBERS TO RECEIVE THAT

06:17:53.984 --> 06:17:55.185
RATE AND SO WE LOOKED AT WHERE

06:17:55.252 --> 06:17:56.653
WE WOULD BE THIS IS A COMPROMISE

06:17:56.720 --> 06:17:58.922
IT IS NOT A PERFECT BILL -- BUT

06:17:58.989 --> 06:18:01.392
WE BELIEVE THAT 36% IS SO MUCH

06:18:01.458 --> 06:18:03.160
BETTER THAN THE 100% INTEREST

06:18:03.227 --> 06:18:05.662
RATE THAT CONSUMERS ARE GETTING --

06:18:05.729 --> 06:18:08.232
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT AS

06:18:08.298 --> 06:18:11.402
HAS BEEN MENTIONED -- AND AS

06:18:11.468 --> 06:18:14.905
SEEN IN THE ANALYSIS THAT AT 36%

06:18:14.972 --> 06:18:16.440
WE STILL HAVE.

06:18:16.507 --> 06:18:18.342
COMPANIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE

06:18:18.409 --> 06:18:21.045
THAT ARE OFFERING TWO BILLION

06:18:21.111 --> 06:18:23.213
DOLLARS WORTH OF CREDIT. TWO

06:18:23.280 --> 06:18:24.982
BILLION WORTH OF CREDIT TO THE

06:18:25.049 --> 06:18:26.517
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

06:18:26.583 --> 06:18:28.485
AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE WON'T

06:18:28.552 --> 06:18:30.320
HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT -- IS NOT

06:18:30.387 --> 06:18:32.189
A REALISTIC IDEA ADDITIONALLY

06:18:32.256 --> 06:18:33.757
THE LEGISLATURE IS MOVING

06:18:33.824 --> 06:18:36.593
FORWARD NEW AND CREATIVE IDEAS

06:18:36.660 --> 06:18:38.862
I'M A MEMBER OF THE SENATE HAS.

06:18:38.929 --> 06:18:41.432
IT IS WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS TO

06:18:41.498 --> 06:18:42.533
OFFER DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT

06:18:42.599 --> 06:18:43.901
ARE IN ALTERNATIVE TO THIS AND

06:18:43.967 --> 06:18:45.436
THAT BILL IS MOVING THROUGH THIS

06:18:45.502 --> 06:18:47.337
LEGISLATURE SO WE ARE GOING TO

06:18:47.404 --> 06:18:48.772
SEE MORE ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS.

06:18:48.839 --> 06:18:50.274
BECAUSE THERE'S A RECOGNITION

06:18:50.340 --> 06:18:51.909
THAT THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT IN

06:18:51.975 --> 06:18:53.844
THE END TOO MANY PEOPLE IN

06:18:53.911 --> 06:18:55.746

06:20:53.463 --> 06:20:55.666

06:45:47.189 --> 06:45:48.123
CONCEPTUALLY THERE'S NO REASON

06:45:48.190 --> 06:45:50.192
WHY MARKET PLACES SHOULD BE ABLE

06:45:50.259 --> 06:45:51.560

COUNTERFEITS BUT THAT'S BESIDE

06:56:19.688 --> 06:56:21.222
THE POINT BECAUSE THIS BILL DOES

EXECUTIONER OF MAKING DECISIONS --

06:57:00.161 --> 06:57:01.529
IT SEEMS UNFAIR TO ME TO SMALL

06:57:01.596 --> 06:57:02.764
BUSINESSES WHO.

LODGED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THAT

06:57:14.743 --> 06:57:15.944
AND THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE OR NOT

06:57:20.448 --> 06:57:22.150
RIGHT NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT

06:57:22.217 --> 06:57:23.385
FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH SMALL

06:57:23.451 --> 06:57:25.120

WE DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR --

06:57:37.999 --> 06:57:39.467
AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE

06:57:39.534 --> 06:57:40.635
SMALL BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE SOME

06:57:40.702 --> 06:57:42.303
OPPORTUNITY TO RETRIEVE THOSE

06:57:42.370 --> 06:57:44.072

IN THIS PROCESS -- AND IT SHOULD

06:57:54.682 --> 06:57:56.251
BE LEFT UP TO I THINK A COMPANY

WITHOUT DUE PROCESS.

06:58:11.266 --> 06:58:13.668

ENFORCE THOSE LAWS.

06:58:18.740 --> 06:58:20.175
SO IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A

CONFUSING AND SLOW IT'S NOT

07:37:07.867 --> 07:37:09.101

IN THIS BILL.

07:40:52.257 --> 07:40:53.525
ONLY FIFTY SEVEN OF THOSE

07:40:53.592 --> 07:40:56.628
ALLEGATIONS ARE POINT 001% FELL

07:40:56.695 --> 07:40:57.129
UNDER THOSE LABOR COULD

07:40:57.196 --> 07:40:57.930

07:40:57.997 --> 07:40:59.698

08:10:55.592 --> 08:10:56.894
IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS ARE IN

08:10:56.960 --> 08:11:00.230
VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW -- AT

FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL HAS

08:11:14.511 --> 08:11:16.213
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY THAN WHAT

08:11:16.280 --> 08:11:17.381
IT WAS LAST YEAR IF YOU LOOK AT

08:11:17.447 --> 08:11:19.716
THE ANALYSIS AND THE IN THE

08:11:19.783 --> 08:11:20.584
INFORMATION FACT SHEET ON ON THE

08:11:20.651 --> 08:11:20.784

08:11:23.053 --> 08:11:24.688
EXPERIENCE.

08:11:24.755 --> 08:11:26.723
HAVING PRACTICED IMMIGRATION ON

08:11:26.790 --> 08:11:28.058
THE SALINAS VALLEY.

08:11:28.125 --> 08:11:31.161
THE STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO'VE

08:11:31.228 --> 08:11:34.932
BEEN MISLED IN -- CHARGED HUGE

08:11:34.998 --> 08:11:37.301
SUMS OF MONEY LEADING. TO

08:11:37.367 --> 08:11:40.571
NOTHING SOMETIMES TO DEPORTATION.

08:11:40.637 --> 08:11:42.606
IS OUTRAGEOUS.

08:11:42.673 --> 08:11:44.308
BY THE SAME TOKEN I THINK SOME

08:11:44.374 --> 08:11:45.342
OF THE PEOPLE WE HEARD FROM HERE

08:11:45.409 --> 08:11:46.844
TODAY.

08:11:46.910 --> 08:11:48.946
OUR SINCERE AND EARNEST

08:11:49.012 --> 08:11:52.482
COMMUNITY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

08:11:52.549 --> 08:11:54.785
WORKING WITH NON PROFITS --

08:11:54.852 --> 08:11:55.552
TRYING TO MAKE A POSITIVE

08:11:55.619 --> 08:11:58.522
DIFFERENCE -- I'M SUPPORTIVE OF

08:11:58.589 --> 08:12:01.925
THE NEED [inaudible] FOR BETTER

08:12:01.992 --> 08:12:04.228
REGULATION.

08:12:04.294 --> 08:12:05.896
LICENSING AND OVERSIGHT I WOULD

08:12:05.963 --> 08:12:07.664
THINK A PATHWAY FOR SOME OF

08:12:07.731 --> 08:12:09.533
THOSE WHO FEEL THAT.

08:12:09.600 --> 08:12:11.268
THEY WILL LOSE SOME.

08:12:11.335 --> 08:12:13.270
THEIR FUTURE OR THE ABILITY TO

08:12:13.337 --> 08:12:14.805
KEEP DOING THE WORK THEY'VE BEEN

08:12:14.872 --> 08:12:16.039
DOING.

08:12:16.106 --> 08:12:17.608
WOULD BE TO AFFILIATE WITH AN

08:12:17.674 --> 08:12:20.878
ATTORNEY UNDER WHOSE SUPERVISION.

08:12:20.944 --> 08:12:22.412
THEY COULD WORK.

08:12:22.479 --> 08:12:23.313
I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN

08:12:23.380 --> 08:12:26.216
IMPOSSIBLE GOAL FOR THOSE THAT

08:12:26.283 --> 08:12:29.920
ARE COMMITTED. TO FAIR -

08:12:29.987 --> 08:12:31.188
REPRESENTATION.

08:12:31.255 --> 08:12:32.256
UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND

08:12:32.322 --> 08:12:34.258
SUPERVISION OF A SKILLED

08:12:34.324 --> 08:12:36.793
ATTORNEY THERE'S ALSO RECOURSE

08:12:36.860 --> 08:12:38.262
THAN FOR SOMEBODY.

08:12:38.328 --> 08:12:40.230
WHO MIGHT BE MISREPRESENTED OR

08:12:40.297 --> 08:12:42.499
MISLED?

08:12:42.566 --> 08:12:44.635
THROUGH THE STATE BAR -- BASED

08:12:44.701 --> 08:12:47.037
ON THAT SUPERVISING ATTORNEY I

08:12:47.104 --> 08:12:48.839
AM TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL

08:12:48.906 --> 08:12:52.109
TODAY I SUPPORTED OUT LAST YEAR --

08:12:52.175 --> 08:12:53.677
I JUST THINK THE STAKES ARE SO

08:12:53.744 --> 08:12:56.713
HIGH THE DEMAND IS SO GREAT.

08:12:56.780 --> 08:12:58.682
BUT WITH THE CHANGE CIRCUMSTANCE

08:12:58.749 --> 08:13:01.251
GETTING WORSE SINCE LAST YEAR IT

08:13:01.318 --> 08:13:02.886
ALSO RAISES.

08:13:02.953 --> 08:13:05.389
THE RISK OF EXPLOITATION THE

08:13:05.455 --> 08:13:07.791
DESPERATION IS GREATER THAN EVER

08:13:07.858 --> 08:13:09.793
BEFORE THE FEAR OF RAIDS AND

08:13:09.860 --> 08:13:11.328
DEPORTATION.

08:13:11.395 --> 08:13:12.863
AN WHILE THERE ARE THOSE THAT

08:13:12.930 --> 08:13:15.766
ARE EARNEST AND WELL INTENTIONED.

08:13:15.832 --> 08:13:17.501
IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT

08:13:17.567 --> 08:13:20.037
THERE'S A RICH HISTORY OF PEOPLE

08:13:20.103 --> 08:13:22.706
MORE THAN READY TO TAKE PEOPLE'S

08:13:22.773 --> 08:13:25.976
MONEY -- IN PROVIDE NO SERVICE

08:13:26.043 --> 08:13:27.277
THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY

08:13:27.344 --> 08:13:29.546
TO REGULATE THIS I THINK WORKING.

08:13:29.613 --> 08:13:30.647

IT'S SORT OF SAYS THAT.

08:16:06.436 --> 08:16:11.174
IT ALSO SAYS -- THE ACT DOES NOT

08:16:11.241 --> 08:16:12.642
PURPORT TO ALLOW ANYONE TO

08:16:12.709 --> 08:16:14.010

AUTHORIZED OR TO PROVIDE ANY

08:16:16.246 --> 08:16:18.048
KIND OF REPRESENTATION BUT IT

08:16:18.115 --> 08:16:19.649
DOES SAY YOU KNOW THAT A PERSON

08:16:19.716 --> 08:16:21.051

08:16:26.356 --> 08:16:27.624
PREEMPT I DON'T KNOW.

08:16:27.691 --> 08:16:29.726
MAYBE CAN WRESTLE WITH THAT ONE

08:16:29.793 --> 08:16:30.627
SECOND NO WE'RE SHORT ON TIME

08:16:30.694 --> 08:16:32.229
HERE BUT I SENATOR BRIEFLY IF I

08:16:32.295 --> 08:16:33.930
MAY YEAH I DID MENTION THAT IT

08:16:33.997 --> 08:16:35.198
DOES REQUIRE THAT THE PERSON BE

08:16:35.265 --> 08:16:36.366
FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED.

08:16:36.433 --> 08:16:37.601
THERE IS NO CATEGORY OF

08:16:37.667 --> 08:16:39.169
IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT IN THE

08:16:39.236 --> 08:16:41.037
FEDERAL REGULATIONS IT DOES NOT

08:16:41.104 --> 08:16:43.773
EXIST SO CALIFORNIA WE'RE TO

08:16:43.840 --> 08:16:46.109
AFFIRMATIVELY AUTHORIZE THIS

08:16:46.176 --> 08:16:48.478
GROUP -- TO PREPARE FORMS AND

08:16:48.545 --> 08:16:49.913
SEVEN APPLICATIONS I'M IN A WAY

08:16:49.980 --> 08:16:51.581
THAT THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS DO

08:16:51.648 --> 08:16:52.415
NOT.

08:16:52.482 --> 08:16:53.216
WE WOULD HAVE A PREEMPTION

08:16:53.283 --> 08:16:55.418
PROBLEM THERE IS ONE EXTREMELY

08:16:55.485 --> 08:16:58.989
NARROW EXCEPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS

08:16:59.055 --> 08:17:00.123
WHO.

08:17:00.190 --> 08:17:01.391
BILLION BLANK SPACES UNPREPARED

08:17:01.458 --> 08:17:03.260
FORMS UP FREE OF CHARGE OR FOR A

08:17:03.326 --> 08:17:05.028
NOMINAL FEE WITHOUT HOLDING

08:17:05.095 --> 08:17:06.563
THEMSELVES OUT AS BEING HAS

08:17:06.630 --> 08:17:08.598
HAVING ANY EXPERTISE IN

08:17:08.665 --> 08:17:09.499
IMMIGRATION PROCEDURE.

08:17:09.566 --> 08:17:11.201
ON IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS DO

08:17:11.268 --> 08:17:13.270
NOT ACT WITHIN THAT EXTREMELY

08:17:13.336 --> 08:17:15.805
NARROW CONFINES OF THAT IS THE

08:17:15.872 --> 08:17:16.640
PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE.

08:17:16.706 --> 08:17:18.241
ON WITH THIS BILL ELIMINATE

08:17:18.308 --> 08:17:19.809
THOSE PEOPLE FROM DOING THAT

08:17:19.876 --> 08:17:20.777
KIND OF WORK THOUGH.

08:17:20.844 --> 08:17:23.446
THE BILL COULD NOT DO THAT IF

08:17:23.513 --> 08:17:24.848
THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS

08:17:24.915 --> 08:17:28.251
AUTHORIZE THAT -- BUT PRESUMABLY

08:17:28.318 --> 08:17:29.586
WOULD NOT DO THAT.

08:17:29.653 --> 08:17:31.721
SO THE THE ISSUE HERE IS

08:17:31.788 --> 08:17:33.723
CALIFORNIA AUTHORIZING PROVIDERS

08:17:33.790 --> 08:17:36.726
BEYOND THOSE SPECIFICALLY LISTED

08:17:36.793 --> 08:17:38.195
IN THE REGULATIONS.

08:17:38.261 --> 08:17:39.829
SO IF WE WERE TO AUTHORIZE LEGAL

08:17:39.896 --> 08:17:41.431
TRAINING FOR EXAMPLE I'M AND

08:17:41.498 --> 08:17:42.999
THEN INDICATE TO THE PUBLIC THAT

08:17:43.066 --> 08:17:44.734

OF NOT DOING THE QUALITY

08:21:43.139 --> 08:21:45.275

FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THAT

08:22:35.658 --> 08:22:37.293
EXPERTISE.

08:22:37.360 --> 08:22:39.329

THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS IN

08:23:33.883 --> 08:23:35.184
THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS SOME

OTHER QUESTIONS WE DO HAVE A

09:08:29.509 --> 09:08:31.845
MOTION -- I WOULD JUST SIMPLY

09:08:31.912 --> 09:08:33.146
ASK YOU TRY TO WORK OUT IT

09:08:33.213 --> 09:08:34.648
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO

09:08:34.715 --> 09:08:36.016
SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK

09:08:36.083 --> 09:08:37.451
THAT CENTER MONNING WAS.

09:08:37.517 --> 09:08:39.720
INDICATING.

09:08:39.786 --> 09:08:41.388
A CONCERN THAT.

09:08:41.455 --> 09:08:42.756
AGAIN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IF

09:08:42.823 --> 09:08:43.624
WE'RE GONNA HAVE STRICT

09:08:43.690 --> 09:08:45.259
LIABILITY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE

09:08:45.325 --> 09:08:46.560
THAT THERE ARE SOME.

09:08:46.627 --> 09:08:48.595
CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH IT

09:08:48.662 --> 09:08:50.163

09:08:50.230 --> 09:08:51.932
VERY CLOSE TO THAT KIND OF

09:08:51.999 --> 09:08:53.166
RESOLUTION SO.

09:08:55.235 --> 09:08:55.936
THAT.

09:08:56.003 --> 09:08:57.938
THE BILL I DO THINK THOUGH THAT

09:08:58.005 --> 09:08:58.805
DEALS WITH A VERY SERIOUS

09:08:58.872 --> 09:09:00.807
PROBLEM THAT THE ADVERTISING BY

09:09:00.874 --> 09:09:03.010
ON LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES.

09:09:03.076 --> 09:09:05.178

09:09:05.245 --> 09:09:06.546
I'M TOLD THIS IS NOT.

09:09:06.613 --> 09:09:11.151
YOUR MOTHER'S CANNABIS AND YOUR

ANYWAY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE

09:09:14.688 --> 09:09:18.091
CANNABIS OF THE THE OLD DAYS IF

09:09:18.158 --> 09:09:20.294

09:09:20.360 --> 09:09:22.029
LACED WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS

09:09:22.095 --> 09:09:23.664
AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT

09:09:23.730 --> 09:09:25.399
THAT THAT -- WE CAN PROTECT THE

09:15:12.345 --> 09:15:14.981
THE NOTION THAT IT'S RISKS

09:15:15.048 --> 09:15:16.983
REGARDING WIRELESS ONLY PERHAPS

09:15:47.647 --> 09:15:49.549
IT'S NARROWLY CRAFTED TO ADDRESS

09:15:49.616 --> 09:15:52.085

THERE WAS LITTLE OPPORTUNITIES

09:19:06.079 --> 09:19:07.313
FOR DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER INPUT

09:19:07.380 --> 09:19:08.882
AND THE RESULT IS A LOT THAT CAN

09:19:08.948 --> 09:19:09.983
BE CONFUSING.

09:19:10.049 --> 09:19:11.284
AND PRESENTS SOME SERIOUS

09:19:11.351 --> 09:19:13.253
PRIVACY CONCERNS AND OPERATIONAL

MANY OF US LEGISLATORS LAMENTED

09:19:19.559 --> 09:19:21.861
THE NECESSITY A NECESSITY OF OF

09:19:21.928 --> 09:19:24.130
THE PROCESS BUT IT WAS FLAWED.

09:19:24.197 --> 09:19:25.365
AND WE WERE COMMITTED TO WORKING

09:19:25.431 --> 09:19:26.766
WITH THOSE WHO HAD OPERATIONAL

09:19:26.833 --> 09:19:28.735
CONCERNS ABOUT CCPA BEFORE ITS

09:19:28.801 --> 09:19:30.169
EFFECTIVE DATE.

09:19:30.236 --> 09:19:32.205
THIS BILL TAKES ON TWO OF THOSE

09:19:32.272 --> 09:19:34.307
CONCERNS TO THE DEFINITION OF

09:19:36.042 --> 09:19:37.777
WHICH I'M HAPPY THAT THE CHAIR

09:19:37.844 --> 09:19:40.146
AND I AGREE ON AND THE

09:19:40.213 --> 09:19:42.715
DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED WE

09:19:42.782 --> 09:19:44.117
WORKED EARLY ON WITH ALISTAIR

09:19:44.183 --> 09:19:45.151
MAKE THAGARD AND HIS GROUP

09:19:45.218 --> 09:19:46.486
CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER

09:19:46.552 --> 09:19:48.421
PRIVACY. TO MAKE SURE THE BILL

09:19:48.488 --> 09:19:50.690
WAS MAKING THE INTENT OF CCPA

09:19:50.757 --> 09:19:52.091
OPERATIONAL.

09:19:52.158 --> 09:19:53.927
IN THE ASSEMBLY WE TOOK ALL OF

09:19:53.993 --> 09:19:55.094
THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS

09:19:55.161 --> 09:19:56.529
BRINGING HIS GROUP TO A NEUTRAL

09:19:56.596 --> 09:20:02.302
STANCE AND THE EMAIL IS PASSED

09:20:02.368 --> 09:20:05.572
AROUND THAT -- THAT SHOWS THAT.

09:20:05.638 --> 09:20:06.239
WELL I WILL LET MY WITNESSES GET

09:20:06.306 --> 09:20:06.873
INTO THE WORKING DETAILS OF THE

09:20:06.940 --> 09:20:07.540
BILL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL

09:20:07.607 --> 09:20:08.241
WILL PROVIDE A CLEAR

09:20:08.308 --> 09:20:09.976
UNDERSTANDING OF THESE TWO

09:20:10.043 --> 09:20:11.544
THRESHOLD CONSIDERATIONS.

09:20:11.611 --> 09:20:13.379
AND MAKES THE CPA IMPLEMENTATION

09:20:13.446 --> 09:20:15.214
MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND

09:20:15.281 --> 09:20:16.482
WORKABLE.

09:20:16.549 --> 09:20:18.117
IT IS KEY THAT THE CCPA IS

09:20:18.184 --> 09:20:20.153
WORKABLE BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE

09:20:20.219 --> 09:20:22.188
THE MODEL FOR ALL STATES TO

09:20:22.255 --> 09:20:24.090
ADOPT AVOIDING CALLS FOR FEDERAL

09:20:24.157 --> 09:20:25.191
PREEMPTION.

09:20:25.258 --> 09:20:26.960
THAT UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION

09:20:27.026 --> 09:20:29.862
WOULD LIKELY BE FAR WEAKER.

09:20:29.929 --> 09:20:31.497
BUT WE MUST EXPORT TO OUR SISTER

09:20:31.564 --> 09:20:33.800
STATES A WORKING MODEL NOT ONE

09:20:33.866 --> 09:20:35.368
THAT IS OVER BROAD AND HAS AND

09:20:35.435 --> 09:20:36.836
TO DEFINITIONS.

09:20:36.903 --> 09:20:38.805
THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED

09:20:38.871 --> 09:20:41.507
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO FIX AS

09:20:41.574 --> 09:20:43.276
MANY IMPORTANT TYPES OF CONSUMER

09:23:08.754 --> 09:23:10.123
IDENTIFIED DATA.

09:23:10.189 --> 09:23:11.924
THE AUTHORS OF THE CCPA INTENDED

09:23:11.991 --> 09:23:13.192
A TRUE EXEMPTION FOR DE

09:23:13.259 --> 09:23:15.394
IDENTIFIED DATA BECAUSE WE WANT

09:23:15.461 --> 09:23:17.230
IT TO BE DE IDENTIFIED IT IS A

09:23:17.296 --> 09:23:18.731
PRO PRIVACY PRACTICE TO

09:23:18.798 --> 09:23:20.233
INCENTIVIZE BUSINESSES TO INVEST

09:23:20.299 --> 09:23:21.300
IN THEIR RESOURCES TO DE

09:23:21.367 --> 09:23:22.769
IDENTIFY THEIR DATA AND KEEP IT

09:23:22.835 --> 09:23:24.637
DE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE DE

09:23:24.704 --> 09:23:25.238
IDENTIFIED DATA IS FAR LESS

09:23:25.304 --> 09:23:26.973
VULNERABLE TO COMPROMISE AND

09:23:27.039 --> 09:23:28.808
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA.

09:23:28.875 --> 09:23:30.343
UNFORTUNATELY THE CZ P. STATES

09:23:30.409 --> 09:23:31.644
THAT DE IDENTIFIED DATA MUST NOT

RELATE TO OR BE CAPABLE OF BEING

09:23:33.813 --> 09:23:36.249
ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSON BUT

09:23:36.315 --> 09:23:37.650
THOSE THINGS ARE ALWAYS TRUE OF

09:23:37.717 --> 09:23:39.752
DE IDENTIFIED DATA AND THE TERM

09:23:39.819 --> 09:23:40.353
LOSES ALL MEANING IF IT'S NOT

09:23:40.419 --> 09:23:41.120
AMENDED.

09:23:41.187 --> 09:23:42.555
SO AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREES

09:23:42.622 --> 09:23:43.489
REVISED DEFINITION OF DE

09:23:43.556 --> 09:23:44.891
IDENTIFIED WAS DRAWN FROM THE

09:23:44.957 --> 09:23:46.726
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FTC'S

09:23:46.792 --> 09:23:48.327
PRIVACY FRAMEWORK IT IS A WELL

09:23:48.394 --> 09:23:50.396
TESTED WIDELY ACCEPTED PRO

09:23:50.463 --> 09:23:52.131
PRIVACY APPROACH THAT REQUIRES

09:23:52.198 --> 09:23:53.699
KEEPING DATA DE IDENTIFIED.

09:23:53.766 --> 09:23:54.600
FURTHER AS PART OF OUR

THREE INCLUDES ROBUST

09:23:57.770 --> 09:23:59.505
REQUIREMENTS A BUSINESS MUST

09:23:59.572 --> 09:24:00.706
MEET FOR THEIR DE IDENTIFIED

09:24:00.773 --> 09:24:02.875
DATA TO QUALIFY FOR AN EXCEPTION.

09:24:02.942 --> 09:24:03.910
THAT ARE EVEN STRONGER THAN THE

09:24:03.976 --> 09:24:05.878
FTC APPROACH THIS BILL IS

09:24:05.945 --> 09:24:10.750
NECESSARY FOR BUSINESSES TO

09:24:10.816 --> 09:24:12.919
REALISTICALLY RACIALIZED THIS

09:24:12.985 --> 09:24:13.920
LAW IT STRENGTHENS THE CCPA IT

09:24:13.986 --> 09:24:14.954
IS PRO PRIVACY IT WILL MAKE

09:24:15.021 --> 09:24:15.321
CONSUMER SAFER.

09:24:15.388 --> 09:24:16.722
THANK YOU.

09:24:16.789 --> 09:24:17.890
WHICH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE THANK

09:24:17.957 --> 09:24:18.558
YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIRMAN AND

09:24:18.624 --> 09:24:20.126
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY

09:24:20.193 --> 09:24:21.527
NAME IS JIM HALPERT AND I'M IN.

09:24:21.594 --> 09:24:23.462
PRIVATE PRACTICE ADVISING DOZENS

09:24:23.529 --> 09:24:25.364
OF CLIENTS ON PRACTICAL

09:24:25.431 --> 09:24:28.501
COMPLIANCE WITH CCPA. ONE OF THE

09:24:28.568 --> 09:24:29.468
AREAS THIS PARTICULARLY

09:24:29.535 --> 09:24:31.671
PROBLEMATIC IS THE NINE

09:24:31.737 --> 09:24:33.673
DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED DATA

09:24:33.739 --> 09:24:35.608
THAT BOTH.

09:24:35.675 --> 09:24:37.677
ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- OR NGUYEN AND

09:24:37.743 --> 09:24:39.579
SERVE -- JUST ADDRESSED IT'S

09:24:39.645 --> 09:24:41.180
ALMOST ENTIRELY CIRCULAR AN

09:24:41.247 --> 09:24:43.115
EXTREMELY CONFUSING FOR ANY

09:24:43.182 --> 09:24:44.717
CONSUMER WHO WOULD READ THE LAW

09:24:44.784 --> 09:24:46.319
AND ALSO FOR BUSINESSES.

09:24:46.385 --> 09:24:47.787
AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WOULD FIX

09:24:47.853 --> 09:24:50.756
THIS THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD NOT.

09:24:50.823 --> 09:24:53.159
AND IF THIS IS REALLY A A

09:24:53.226 --> 09:24:55.161
CRITICAL ISSUE INSTEAD OF

09:24:55.228 --> 09:24:57.463
CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION DEAL

09:24:57.530 --> 09:24:58.431
AMENDMENTS WOULDN'T CREATE

09:24:58.497 --> 09:25:00.466
NARROW EXCEPTIONS ONLY TO THE

09:25:00.533 --> 09:25:02.168
ACCESS DELETION AND RIGHT TO

09:25:02.235 --> 09:25:03.269
KNOW RIGHTS.

09:25:03.336 --> 09:25:05.538
BUT NO EXCEPTION TO THIS CCPA DO

09:25:05.605 --> 09:25:07.039
NOT SELL REQUIREMENTS.

09:25:07.106 --> 09:25:08.574
THIS MAY SEEM SENSIBLE AT FIRST

09:25:08.641 --> 09:25:10.176
BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT ONCE

09:25:10.243 --> 09:25:11.744
A BUSINESS RECEIVED A DO NOT

09:25:11.811 --> 09:25:13.246
SELL REQUEST.

09:25:13.312 --> 09:25:14.914
THEY WOULD NEED TO PROACTIVELY

09:25:14.981 --> 09:25:17.316
RELAYING ALL DE IDENTIFIED DATA

09:25:17.383 --> 09:25:19.952
IN RESPONSE TO THAT REQUEST THIS

09:25:20.019 --> 09:25:22.121
IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER BY THE

09:25:22.188 --> 09:25:23.122
CURRENT LAW.

09:25:23.189 --> 09:25:24.123
AND WOULD ACTUALLY REQUIRE

09:25:24.190 --> 09:25:25.925
LINKING IN ASSOCIATING ALL DATA

09:25:25.992 --> 09:25:28.628
FOR THAT PURPOSE THIS WOULD MEAN.

09:25:28.694 --> 09:25:30.062
BRINGING MORE DATA TOGETHER

09:25:30.129 --> 09:25:31.731
CREATING SECURITY RISKS AND

09:25:31.797 --> 09:25:33.132
INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESS IS

09:25:33.199 --> 09:25:34.600
ACTUALLY TO USE THE DATA TO

09:25:34.667 --> 09:25:36.469
MONETIZE IT EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T

09:25:36.535 --> 09:25:37.637
SELLING IT.

09:25:37.703 --> 09:25:39.272
SO THE NET EFFECT IS NOT TO

09:25:39.338 --> 09:25:41.774
INCREASE PRIVACY THE AMENDMENTS

09:25:41.841 --> 09:25:46.879
ALSO -- DON'T ADDRESS OF THE AN

09:25:46.946 --> 09:25:49.181
ISSUE THAT DATE AB EIGHT SEVENTY

09:25:49.248 --> 09:25:50.516
THREE DOES VERY WELL THEY DON'T

09:25:50.583 --> 09:25:53.719
INCENTIVIZE THE IDENTIFYING DATA

09:25:53.786 --> 09:25:55.988
THEY SIMPLY CREATE EXCEPTIONS TO

09:25:56.055 --> 09:25:57.723
HAVING TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS.

09:25:57.790 --> 09:25:58.991
UNDER AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IF

09:25:59.058 --> 09:26:00.760
THE DATA WERE EVER RE IDENTIFIED

09:26:00.826 --> 09:26:02.728
IT WOULD BECOME FULLY SUBJECT TO

09:26:02.795 --> 09:26:05.698
THE C. CPA AND ANY RECIPIENT WHO

09:26:05.765 --> 09:26:06.165

09:38:05.617 --> 09:38:07.886
AUTHOR.

09:38:07.953 --> 09:38:09.388

09:38:09.454 --> 09:38:13.392
AMENDMENTS OBJECTIONABLE?

09:38:13.458 --> 09:38:15.093
OF BY I WILL CERTAINLY GO

09:38:15.160 --> 09:38:16.661

09:38:16.728 --> 09:38:18.030
CLARIFY A FEW THINGS THE

09:38:18.096 --> 09:38:20.032
GENTLEMAN FROM THE ACLU TALK

09:38:20.098 --> 09:38:21.033

IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INDIVIDUAL

09:38:28.140 --> 09:38:31.143
IT DOES BECOME PI AND AND THE

09:38:31.209 --> 09:38:32.611
SECOND THING THAT I WOULD LIKE

09:38:32.677 --> 09:38:34.813
TO SAY IS THAT IF WE ARE GOING

09:38:34.880 --> 09:38:35.614

09:38:39.017 --> 09:38:40.452
ANYTHING.

09:38:40.519 --> 09:38:42.587
THEN WE HAVE A REALLY BIG

09:38:42.654 --> 09:38:44.489
PROBLEM IN BEING ABLE TO DO

09:38:44.556 --> 09:38:49.127

ON RESEARCH THIS COULD

09:38:57.235 --> 09:38:58.670
POTENTIALLY HAVE AN EXCESS A

09:38:58.737 --> 09:39:00.172

ALL SORTS OF BIG DATA DE

09:39:02.474 --> 09:39:04.843
IDENTIFIED DATA THAT WE CAN USE

09:39:04.910 --> 09:39:08.413
FOR OUR OWN. FOR FOR THE BENEFIT

09:39:08.480 --> 09:39:09.448
OF IMPROVING LIVES

09:39:09.514 --> 09:39:12.084
UGH THE REASON THAT I AM NOT

09:39:12.150 --> 09:39:13.452
WILLING.

09:39:13.518 --> 09:39:15.554
TO TAKE THIS LANGUAGE IS FIRST

09:39:15.620 --> 09:39:17.823
OF ALL THIS LANGUAGE.

09:39:17.889 --> 09:39:19.024

09:39:19.091 --> 09:39:20.892
NEGOTIATION AND THE ACTUAL

09:39:20.959 --> 09:39:22.561
AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL

09:39:22.627 --> 09:39:24.863
LEGISLATION IT WAS -- ALISTAIR

09:39:24.930 --> 09:39:27.466

09:39:30.602 --> 09:39:32.370
NEUTRALIZE IT THE AMENDMENTS TO

09:39:32.437 --> 09:39:33.905
THIS -- WERE SHARED WITH MY

09:39:33.972 --> 09:39:35.607
OFFICE LESS THAN FORTY EIGHT

09:39:35.674 --> 09:39:36.641
HOURS AGO.

09:39:36.708 --> 09:39:37.843
AND WHILE THE WHOLE COALITION

09:39:37.909 --> 09:39:38.910
HAS NOT HAD TIME TO FULLY

09:39:38.977 --> 09:39:40.645
ANALYZE THE PROPOSAL THEIR

09:39:40.712 --> 09:39:42.247
INITIAL READING.

09:39:42.314 --> 09:39:43.949
OF THAT RESULTED IN A RESOUNDING

09:39:44.015 --> 09:39:45.717
OBJECTIONS IS THAT IT WOULD GO

09:39:45.784 --> 09:39:47.819
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND

09:39:47.886 --> 09:39:49.855
FOR OUR DE IDENTIFIED OF FIX AS

09:39:49.921 --> 09:39:51.189
A MATTER OF FACT WE THINK THIS

09:39:51.256 --> 09:39:53.859
FIX IS A WORSE THAN.

09:39:53.925 --> 09:39:55.627
THE ORIGINAL BILL.

09:39:55.694 --> 09:39:57.195
UNDER EXISTING.

09:39:57.262 --> 09:39:58.530

09:40:00.132 --> 09:40:02.000
FREELY MARKETABLE INSURABLE

09:40:02.067 --> 09:40:03.568

VERSUS THE CPA.

09:40:05.237 --> 09:40:06.238
THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD

09:40:06.304 --> 09:40:08.073
PROHIBIT THE SALE OR SHARING OF

DATA ENTIRELY WHICH POSES

09:40:11.710 --> 09:40:14.179
EXTREMELY LESS RISK TO PRIVACY.

BEEN LINKED TO OR ASSOCIATED

09:40:15.847 --> 09:40:18.517
DATA AND AGAIN I THINK THAT

09:40:18.583 --> 09:40:19.117
THERE IS.

09:40:19.184 --> 09:40:21.386
AN INCREDIBLE PROBLEM IF WE SAY

09:40:21.453 --> 09:40:23.355
IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOT GOING

09:40:23.421 --> 09:40:26.024

09:43:39.884 --> 09:43:42.220
ABILITY TO TRACK.

09:43:42.287 --> 09:43:43.555
WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS CELL

09:43:49.694 --> 09:43:51.162
IF YOU TAKE A DEFINITION THE

IDENTIFIED DOES NOT INCLUDE IP

09:43:52.397 --> 09:43:54.799

DEVICE ID'S.

09:43:56.701 --> 09:43:57.602
THEY WOULD PERMIT THAT KIND OF

09:43:57.669 --> 09:43:58.403
TRACKING.

09:43:58.470 --> 09:44:03.208
THANK YOU NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO AS CORRECT --

09:44:07.379 --> 09:44:11.716

THE CURRENCY CPA.

09:44:16.921 --> 09:44:18.957
DOES NOT PRECLUDE IN ANYWAY

09:44:19.023 --> 09:44:20.525
RESEARCH.

09:44:20.592 --> 09:44:22.927
SO WHAT WHAT THIS NEW DEFINITION

09:44:22.994 --> 09:44:25.463
DOES IS IT NOW INCLUDES

09:44:25.530 --> 09:44:26.898
INFORMATION THAT.

09:44:26.965 --> 09:44:29.467

ASSOCIATED BACK TO US.

09:44:31.403 --> 09:44:33.571
SO IT BASICALLY.

09:44:33.638 --> 09:44:36.307
A EXPANDS THE INFORMATION THAT'S

09:44:36.374 --> 09:44:37.142
AVAILABLE.

09:44:37.208 --> 09:44:39.043
THE BECAUSE IT CAN BE REASONABLY

09:44:39.110 --> 09:44:40.678

THAT IN THE BILL -- FOR FURTHER.

09:44:44.149 --> 09:44:45.517
UP WE'RE MAKING IT POSSIBLE

09:44:45.583 --> 09:44:47.352

BE READY -- IDENTIFIED WITH US

09:44:54.926 --> 09:44:58.129
SO IT'S IT'S BASICALLY EXPANDING

09:44:58.196 --> 09:44:59.631
WHAT'S OUT THERE THAT DOESN'T

09:44:59.697 --> 09:45:00.732

09:46:36.494 --> 09:46:38.463
MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE

TWENTY TWELVE FTC DEFINITION WE

09:46:40.932 --> 09:46:43.668
DO CONTEST THAT THE THE READING

09:49:51.723 --> 09:49:53.558
FINDING ALL THEIR DATA THEY HAVE

09:49:53.624 --> 09:49:55.226
TO MAP ALL THEIR DATA.

09:49:55.293 --> 09:49:57.962
AND ONCE THEY COMBINED THAT DATA.

09:49:58.029 --> 09:49:59.530
IT'S VERY COSTLY THE BUSINESS

09:49:59.597 --> 09:50:01.299
INCENTIVE FOR THE BUSINESS IS TO

09:50:01.365 --> 09:50:03.601
CONTINUE TO USE IT ONCE THEY PUT

09:50:03.668 --> 09:50:05.336
IT ALL TOGETHER SO YOU WIND UP

09:50:05.403 --> 09:50:06.938
WITH DATA LINKS I DON'T MEAN TO

09:50:07.004 --> 09:50:07.705
CUT YOU OFF BUT I GUESS I'M JUST

09:50:07.772 --> 09:50:08.506
TRYING TO GET IT.

09:50:08.573 --> 09:50:10.541
GET TO THE HEART OF IT IN PLAIN

09:50:10.608 --> 09:50:12.310
PLAIN ENGLISH IS ESSENTIALLY

09:50:12.376 --> 09:50:13.478
CURRENT LAW.

09:50:13.544 --> 09:50:14.378
MAYBE YOU CAN CLEAR BY THE

09:50:14.445 --> 09:50:17.615
CURRENT LAW REQUIRES YOU TO GO.

09:50:17.682 --> 09:50:19.117
GET DEEPER INTO.

09:50:19.183 --> 09:50:23.654
CONSUMERS PRIVATE DATED TO THEN.

09:50:23.721 --> 09:50:24.589
RIGHT NOW THE DEFINITION IS A

09:50:24.655 --> 09:50:26.591
CAPABLE OF YOU KNOW PERSONAL

09:50:26.657 --> 09:50:28.226
IDENTIFICATION FOR KATE.

09:50:28.292 --> 09:50:30.161

CAPABLE OF IDENTIFIED -- BEING

09:50:32.964 --> 09:50:33.931
IDENTIFIED WITH HER SO THAT.

09:50:33.998 --> 09:50:35.466
ADDING THE REASONABLY AND I'D

09:50:35.533 --> 09:50:36.901
THE WAY I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT IT

09:50:36.968 --> 09:50:38.970
IN THE EXAMPLE IN THE SHEET IS

09:50:39.036 --> 09:50:40.872
THAT IF YOU'RE IN A DEPARTMENT

09:50:40.938 --> 09:50:42.206
STORE AND YOU'RE USING A CREDIT

09:50:42.273 --> 09:50:44.609
CARD -- THE DEPARTMENT STORE HAS

09:50:44.675 --> 09:50:45.777
AND YOU DO TELL NOW THE

09:50:45.843 --> 09:50:48.746
DEPARTMENT STORE THAT YOU WANT --

09:50:48.813 --> 09:50:49.480
TO A RIGHT YOU WANT TO BE

09:50:49.547 --> 09:50:50.648
FORGOTTEN YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TO

09:50:50.715 --> 09:50:52.750
BE FORGOTTEN SO THEY GO IN AND

09:50:52.817 --> 09:50:54.786
REYES ALL THE RECORDS THEY HAVE

09:50:54.852 --> 09:50:56.788
ABOUT YOU ALL THE PURCHASES THAT

09:50:56.854 --> 09:50:58.122
YOU MADE THAT THEY THEY ARE RACE

09:50:58.189 --> 09:50:59.857
EVERYTHING THAT THEY THAT THE

09:50:59.924 --> 09:51:01.192
KID THEY CAN REASONABLY

09:51:01.259 --> 09:51:02.493
ASSOCIATE WITH YOU.

09:51:02.560 --> 09:51:03.761
BUT IF YOU GET RID OF THE

09:51:03.828 --> 09:51:05.797
REASONABLY THEN THEY HAVE TO

09:51:05.863 --> 09:51:08.199
START GETTING ADDITIONAL PIECES

09:51:08.266 --> 09:51:10.134
OF DATA TO TRY TO DELETE THOSE

09:51:10.201 --> 09:51:12.003
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU GO TO THE

09:51:12.069 --> 09:51:13.237
STORE CAMERA NOW YOU'RE GONNA

09:51:13.304 --> 09:51:14.405
HAVE TO USE.

09:51:14.472 --> 09:51:16.140
A FACIAL RECOGNITION BECAUSE

09:51:16.207 --> 09:51:17.275
WHAT IF YOU'RE ON THE STORE

09:51:17.341 --> 09:51:18.543
CAMERA OR WHAT IF THERE'S A

09:51:18.609 --> 09:51:20.111
CAMERA NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM

09:51:20.178 --> 09:51:21.612
AND THEN WE YOU BUT IF THERE'S A

09:51:21.679 --> 09:51:25.216
CAMERA NEAR THE BATHROOM NOW YOU

09:51:25.283 --> 09:51:25.416
HAVE.

09:51:25.483 --> 09:51:26.851
TO IDENTIFY.

09:51:26.918 --> 09:51:27.752
OF IDENTIFIED EVERY BIT OF

09:51:27.819 --> 09:51:28.586
INFORMATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT

09:51:28.653 --> 09:51:31.522
STORE HAS TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE --

09:51:31.589 --> 09:51:33.424
TO DELETE SO THAT'S WHY THE

09:51:33.491 --> 09:51:36.527
DEFINITION OF CAPABLE IS IT

09:51:36.594 --> 09:51:38.329
COULD BE RIGHT NOW IT'S GOOD AND

09:51:38.396 --> 09:51:39.397
AND IT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT

09:51:39.463 --> 09:51:40.431
TO PULL TOGETHER IT'S REALLY

09:51:40.498 --> 09:51:42.233
ANTI PRIVACY OR COULD BE IN THE

09:51:42.300 --> 09:51:43.734
FUTURE YOU KNOW IT COULD BE ALL

09:51:43.801 --> 09:51:44.468
OF A SUDDEN.

09:51:44.535 --> 09:51:47.138
YOU USE SOME RANDOM COMPUTER AT

09:51:47.205 --> 09:51:50.641
YOUR BUSINESS AND OF NOW NOW

OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION.

10:11:42.866 --> 10:11:44.267
BECAUSE IT FORCES CONSUMERS TO

10:11:44.334 --> 10:11:45.301
CHOOSE BETWEEN AFFORDABLE

10:11:45.368 --> 10:11:47.137

PURCHASES AND OFFERS CONSUMERS

10:11:58.915 --> 10:12:00.884
BENEFITS BASED ON THAT -- AND

10:12:00.950 --> 10:12:02.585
IT'S EASY PA HAS NO IMPLICATIONS

10:12:02.652 --> 10:12:04.821
ON THAT WHATSOEVER BUT THIS BILL

10:12:04.888 --> 10:12:06.689
IS NOT ABOUT REWARDING CONSUMER

10:12:06.756 --> 10:12:08.425
LOYALTY IT'S ABOUT.

10:12:08.491 --> 10:12:09.959
GIVING COMPANIES THE RIGHT TO

10:12:10.026 --> 10:12:11.428

10:12:11.494 --> 10:12:12.862
EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER

10:12:12.929 --> 10:12:14.130
THE CCPA.

10:12:14.197 --> 10:12:15.398
INCLUDING OPTING OUT OF SALE

10:12:15.465 --> 10:12:17.767
THEIR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTY

10:12:17.834 --> 10:12:19.169
DATA BROKERS THAT COULD HAVE

10:12:19.235 --> 10:12:20.570
IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSUMERS IN

10:12:20.637 --> 10:12:23.073
WAYS THEY COULDN'T REASONABLY

10:12:23.139 --> 10:12:23.640
ANTICIPATE.

10:12:23.706 --> 10:12:25.875
COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED

10:12:25.942 --> 10:12:29.379
TO CHARGE CONSUMERS OR MONETIZE --

10:12:29.446 --> 10:12:31.714
BASIC RIGHTS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

10:12:31.781 --> 10:12:33.550
ALTHOUGH.

10:12:33.616 --> 10:12:36.820
pSAFETY RATES TO ENSURE THAT POOR

PEOPLE CAN'T BE FORCED.

10:12:38.655 --> 10:12:41.958
TO BUY -- PRODUCTS THAT ARE

10:12:42.025 --> 10:12:44.027
HARMFUL TO THEM -- THE

10:12:44.094 --> 10:12:45.728
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ARE NOT

10:12:45.795 --> 10:12:47.530
ARE IDEAL SCENARIO BUT WE THINK

10:12:47.597 --> 10:12:50.767
THAT THEY WOULD GO A LONG WAY --

10:12:50.834 --> 10:12:52.302
TO ENTERING A COMPROMISE AND

10:12:52.368 --> 10:12:53.837
MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS CAN

10:12:53.903 --> 10:12:55.004
EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE

10:12:55.071 --> 10:12:58.341
CCPA WITHOUT BEING PENALIZED IN.

10:12:58.408 --> 10:13:01.044
ANYWAY -- IT WITHOUT THAT WOULD

10:13:01.111 --> 10:13:02.078
RESULT FOR OPPOSITION.

10:13:02.145 --> 10:13:04.614

BURKE FROM OAKLAND PRIVACY WE

CAME IN THIS EVENING WHICH WITH

10:13:08.751 --> 10:13:11.354
TO CONCERNS ABOUT EIGHT FORTY

10:13:11.421 --> 10:13:12.655
SIX ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN.

10:13:12.722 --> 10:13:15.058
AMENDED OUT WHICH WAS THE

10:13:15.125 --> 10:13:18.194
FUNCTIONAL QUICK REQUIREMENT FOR

10:13:18.261 --> 10:13:19.829
THE USE OF DATA WHICH WE WANT TO

10:13:19.896 --> 10:13:21.731
SAY WAS CATEGORICALLY A BACK

10:13:21.798 --> 10:13:22.765
DOOR.

10:13:22.832 --> 10:13:24.334
TO PAY TO PRIVACY WHICH WE DID

10:13:24.400 --> 10:13:26.002
AGREE TO TAKE YES AND THANK YOU

10:13:26.069 --> 10:13:26.736
FOR THAT.

10:13:26.803 --> 10:13:28.505
AND THE SECOND CONCERN THAT WE

10:13:28.571 --> 10:13:31.474
HAVE -- IS WITH THE AMENDMENT OF

10:13:31.541 --> 10:13:33.109
THE AUTHOR IS NOT TAKING AS MY

10:13:33.176 --> 10:13:34.711
COLLEAGUE SAID WE'RE BASICALLY

10:13:34.777 --> 10:13:37.547
LOOKING AT UTILIZING PEOPLE X..

10:13:37.614 --> 10:13:39.149
FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHTS THAT

10:13:39.215 --> 10:13:41.284
ARE GRANTED TO THEM UNDER THE

10:13:41.351 --> 10:13:42.785
CPA AND WHAT KIND OF A RIGHT.

10:13:42.852 --> 10:13:44.521
IS IT IF YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO

10:13:44.587 --> 10:13:47.457
PAY IN ORDER TO EXECUTE IT.

10:13:47.524 --> 10:13:49.159
I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL THAT

10:13:49.225 --> 10:13:50.393
LOYALTY PROBLEMS ARE BY THE

10:13:50.460 --> 10:13:51.995
PROGRAMS ARE BY THEIR VERY

10:13:52.061 --> 10:13:53.796
DEFINITION OPT IN I MEAN MOST

10:13:53.863 --> 10:13:55.064
PEOPLE DON'T END UP AND ROLLED

10:13:55.131 --> 10:13:56.699
IN A FREQUENT FLYER PLAN WITHOUT

10:13:56.766 --> 10:13:58.635
ACTUALLY TAKING SOME ACTION TO

10:13:58.701 --> 10:13:59.335
DO THAT.

10:13:59.402 --> 10:14:00.603
BUT THE QUESTION IS SORT OF WHAT

10:14:00.670 --> 10:14:02.839
PEOPLE ARE OPTING IN CHIU AND DO

10:14:02.906 --> 10:14:04.507

10:14:04.574 --> 10:14:05.942

SOLD SOME ADVERTISEMENTS FOR

10:14:13.283 --> 10:14:15.118

FIFTY DIFFERENT DATA BROKERS SO

10:14:18.521 --> 10:14:20.223
THE QUESTION OF SORT OF WHAT

10:14:20.290 --> 10:14:22.392
WE'RE AGREEING TO AND WHETHER WE

10:14:22.458 --> 10:14:24.394

RIGHT TO CHARGE PEOPLE FOR

10:14:41.010 --> 10:14:47.083
OPTING OUT AND I DON'T THINK WE

10:16:43.132 --> 10:16:45.568
DIFFERENT -- THEY'RE A GREAT

10:16:45.635 --> 10:16:46.936

HAVE TO FLY UP HERE EVERY WEEK

10:16:49.038 --> 10:16:51.741
FOR ON SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WE OPT

10:16:51.808 --> 10:16:53.076
INTO THEIR LOYALTY PROGRAM.

10:16:53.142 --> 10:16:55.912
I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE --

10:16:55.978 --> 10:16:58.348
TO TO HAVE MY HUSBAND IS MY

10:16:58.414 --> 10:17:00.316
COMPANION. TO ACCRUE MILES SO

10:17:00.383 --> 10:17:01.884
THAT I CAN GO VISIT MY GRAND

10:17:01.951 --> 10:17:05.555

10:17:05.621 --> 10:17:06.556
WHAT IS HAVE ME THAT I'M IN A

10:17:06.622 --> 10:17:08.191

LOYALTY I'M EXPRESSING MY

10:17:10.526 --> 10:17:11.894

THAT INFORMATION.

10:17:21.771 --> 10:17:25.241
AND I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE

10:17:25.308 --> 10:17:26.442
ISSUE HERE.

10:17:26.509 --> 10:17:28.611
SO THE THE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE

10:17:28.678 --> 10:17:30.513
IN THE BILL UP MAKES IT CLEAR

10:17:30.580 --> 10:17:31.981

I CAN STILL TASTE IT BUT IT WAS

10:17:47.764 --> 10:17:48.998
FUN YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAD A

10:17:49.065 --> 10:17:50.366
BOOK IN YOU COULD BUY SOMETHING

WITH IT.

10:17:51.200 --> 10:17:53.035
A BOOK OF STAMPS BUT THAT YOU

10:17:53.102 --> 10:17:54.604
DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE BUT THIS

10:17:54.670 --> 10:17:57.073
BILL HOWEVER DOES NOT CONSTRAIN

10:17:57.140 --> 10:17:59.675
WHAT THE BUSINESS CAN DO WITH

10:17:59.742 --> 10:18:01.277
PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT

10:18:01.344 --> 10:18:03.112

10:18:10.453 --> 10:18:14.657
USING OF MYSELF WHICH MILES --

10:18:14.724 --> 10:18:16.926
DO I KNOW THAT THE IN ADDITION

10:18:16.993 --> 10:18:18.795
SUDDENLY I'M GOING TO START

10:18:18.861 --> 10:18:20.263
GETTING ALL THESE ADS FOR

10:18:20.329 --> 10:18:23.499

10:18:25.735 --> 10:18:26.636

NOW I MAY WANT TO DO THAT I MAY

10:18:28.905 --> 10:18:30.706
SAY THIS IS A GREAT ADDITION BUT

10:18:30.773 --> 10:18:31.874
I WANT TO AT LEAST HAVE THE

10:18:31.941 --> 10:18:34.811
RIGHT. TO SAY THAT OR NOT AND IF

10:18:34.877 --> 10:18:36.512
I AM GOING TO OPT OUT OF THEIR

10:18:36.579 --> 10:18:37.580

10:18:37.647 --> 10:18:39.549
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO THEN AND

10:18:39.615 --> 10:18:41.117
THIS IS PART OF WHAT THE BILL

10:18:41.184 --> 10:18:42.885
CURRENTLY DOES.

10:18:42.952 --> 10:18:44.220
IS IF I OPT OUT.

10:18:44.287 --> 10:18:50.393
I CAN'T GET THE SAME BENEFITS.

10:18:50.460 --> 10:18:51.260
AND AND THAT IS A PROBLEM IF I

10:18:51.327 --> 10:18:52.094
WANT MY PRIVACY THEN I HAVE TO

10:18:52.161 --> 10:18:53.596

AND BY THE WAY WE ACTUALLY SAID

10:23:10.686 --> 10:23:11.821
IN THE STATEMENT WE'RE WILLING

10:23:11.887 --> 10:23:13.456
TO CONTINUE TO CLARIFY WHAT

10:23:13.522 --> 10:23:15.257
SHARE MEANS.

10:23:15.324 --> 10:23:16.492
OUR CONCERN IS THAT THERE IS A

10:23:16.559 --> 10:23:18.728
THERE IS IF THIS IS NOT CLEAR

10:23:18.794 --> 10:23:20.029
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

10:23:20.096 --> 10:23:22.565

10:23:22.631 --> 10:23:24.366
CONFUSING.

I RESPECT WHAT WAS DONE IN THE

10:23:26.102 --> 10:23:27.403
C. C. P. AND I RESPECT THAT THE

I REALLY DO -- WHEN I WENT TO MY

10:23:31.540 --> 10:23:32.408
DISTRICT AND TALKED ABOUT THE

10:23:32.475 --> 10:23:33.743
FACT THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS ARE

10:23:33.809 --> 10:23:35.644
GOING AWAY OVER ALL THE OTHER

10:23:35.711 --> 10:23:36.879
BILLS I WAS WORKING ON?

10:23:36.946 --> 10:23:38.848
PEOPLE'S FIRST ALERT WAS THAT

10:23:38.914 --> 10:23:40.416
RAIN AND SO I RESPECT THE WORK

10:23:40.483 --> 10:23:42.017

10:23:42.084 --> 10:23:43.719
WANT TO CHANGE IT I'M NOT TRYING

10:23:43.786 --> 10:23:44.754
TO LOOSEN IT.

10:23:44.820 --> 10:23:46.589
I AM JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE

10:23:46.655 --> 10:23:48.657
THAT IT IS MORE CLEAR SO A MEMO

10:23:48.724 --> 10:23:50.693
THAT WERE PROPOSED UNFORTUNATELY

10:23:50.760 --> 10:23:51.327
FOR US.

10:23:51.393 --> 10:23:52.628
PARTS OF THEM WERE NOT

10:23:52.695 --> 10:23:53.629
COMPLETELY CLEAR BUT WE ARE

10:23:53.696 --> 10:23:55.765
FULLY COMMITTED TO WORKING TO

MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT SOME

10:23:57.399 --> 10:23:59.068
OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE LEFT

10:23:59.135 --> 10:24:00.302
AND LEFT UNCLEAR.

10:24:00.369 --> 10:24:02.204
ARE MADE MORE CLEAR SO WOULD YOU

10:24:02.271 --> 10:24:03.839
TAKE A MOMENT TO RESTRICT ALL

10:24:03.906 --> 10:24:05.875
SALES FOR PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE

10:24:05.941 --> 10:24:08.043
IN THESE LOYALTY PROGRAM SO YOU

10:24:08.110 --> 10:24:12.681

10:24:12.748 --> 10:24:14.583
IT'S MY REAL THE COULD LOOK I

10:24:14.650 --> 10:24:17.153

THINK THAT MAKES CARE OF A LOT

10:24:20.055 --> 10:24:21.357
OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE.

10:24:21.423 --> 10:24:22.057
YEAH RIGHT IT'S VERY GOOD APP

10:24:22.124 --> 10:24:24.493
BUT IT IS WE ARE NOT GOING TO

10:24:24.560 --> 10:24:26.896
SELL THE INFORMATION.

10:24:26.962 --> 10:24:28.397
OKAY KNOW WHAT I THINK THAT'S

10:24:28.464 --> 10:24:30.266
VERY HELPFUL.

10:24:30.332 --> 10:24:31.567
WHAT WE SHARE IS COMPLICATED AND

10:24:31.634 --> 10:24:32.434
THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO CLARIFY

10:24:32.501 --> 10:24:35.371
SHARE -- SORRY THROUGH THE CHAIR

10:24:35.437 --> 10:24:37.273

10:24:37.339 --> 10:24:38.407
PLEASE FEEL FREE.

10:24:38.474 --> 10:24:39.275
I'M SURE IT THE PROBLEM IS IS

10:24:39.341 --> 10:24:40.109
THE WAY IT'S DEFINED IN THE

10:24:40.176 --> 10:24:41.610
AMENDMENTS THAT WE WERE GIVEN

10:24:41.677 --> 10:24:43.179
SHARES AND CLEAR SO LIKE SO WHAT

10:24:43.245 --> 10:24:45.047
HAPPENS ISN'T THERE ARE

10:24:45.114 --> 10:24:48.751
INSTANCES IN WHICH SHARE MAY BE.

10:24:48.818 --> 10:24:50.252
THE MAJOR CORPORATION HAS A

10:24:50.319 --> 10:24:52.221
PRIVATE LITTLE PORTION THAT HAS

10:24:52.288 --> 10:24:53.923
MORE LIKE I SAID MORE MARRIOTT

10:24:53.989 --> 10:24:55.658
HOTELS.

10:24:55.724 --> 10:24:56.258
ON THIS AFFECTS HOTEL WORKERS

10:24:56.325 --> 10:24:58.327
RIGHT THIS WE HAVE ANOTHER HOTEL

10:24:58.394 --> 10:24:59.762
THAT THERE'S A AND THAT.

10:24:59.829 --> 10:25:01.463
SPECIFIC PROPERTY AS A PRIVATE

10:25:01.530 --> 10:25:02.398
PROPERTY.

10:25:02.464 --> 10:25:04.033
ACCORDING TO THE MOMENT THAT WE

10:25:04.099 --> 10:25:05.701
WERE GIVEN IT WOULDN'T ALLOW US

10:25:05.768 --> 10:25:07.670
TO SHARE THOSE THOSE POINTS WITH

10:25:07.736 --> 10:25:09.471
THAT PARTICULAR HOTEL WHICH GETS

10:25:09.538 --> 10:25:10.306
SUPER COMPLICATED.

10:25:10.372 --> 10:25:11.841
WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE

10:25:11.907 --> 10:25:14.176
CONVERSATION OF WHAT SHARE MEANS

10:25:14.243 --> 10:25:15.911
WE JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR I'M

10:25:15.978 --> 10:25:17.179
NOT PASSING A BILL TO MAKE IT

10:25:17.246 --> 10:25:19.582
MORE UNCLEAR I'M PASSING A BILL

10:25:19.648 --> 10:25:21.217
TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR -- AND

10:25:21.283 --> 10:25:24.587
MIGHT LIKE I SAID MY GOAL IS NOT.

10:25:24.653 --> 10:25:26.889
TO TO ANA DISMISSED THE CCPA AND

10:25:26.956 --> 10:25:28.224
I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT WE

10:25:28.290 --> 10:25:28.924
HAVE MICK JAGGER AND NEUTRAL

10:25:28.991 --> 10:25:31.193
SHOWS THAT WE HAVE DONE THE WORK

10:25:31.260 --> 10:25:31.660
TO DO THAT [inaudible]

10:25:31.727 --> 10:25:35.598
BUT I STILL IT THEY HAVE TO BE

10:25:35.664 --> 10:25:37.166
FUNCTIONAL AND LIKE I SAID.

10:25:37.233 --> 10:25:38.701
IN MY DISTRICT THERE ARE PEOPLE

10:25:38.767 --> 10:25:40.836
WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAMS

10:25:40.903 --> 10:25:43.639
AND EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS EVEN FOR

10:25:43.706 --> 10:25:45.107
MYSELF BE CLEAR I'M A SINGLE

10:25:45.174 --> 10:25:47.109
MOTHER AND JUST LIKE THAT JUST

10:25:47.176 --> 10:25:48.911
LIKE THE SENATOR SAID.

10:25:48.978 --> 10:25:51.013
I USE MY CREDIT CARD TO GET

10:25:51.080 --> 10:25:52.448
SOUTH WEST POINT AND NOT TELL MY

10:25:52.514 --> 10:25:53.883
DAUGHTER GETS HERE.

10:25:53.949 --> 10:25:56.051
EVERY WEEK BECAUSE I'VE USE THAT

10:25:56.118 --> 10:25:56.886
CREDIT CARD NUMBER ON THOSE

10:25:56.952 --> 10:25:57.753
POINTS.

10:25:57.820 --> 10:25:58.954
THESE POINTS BATTERY PEOPLE AND

10:25:59.021 --> 10:26:01.290
LOYALTY MATTERS TO COMPANIES AND

10:26:01.357 --> 10:26:03.192
TO PEOPLE AND THE BENEFITS THAT

10:26:03.259 --> 10:26:04.660
COME WITH THAT ARE IN.

10:26:04.727 --> 10:26:07.429
ARE IMPORTANT AND WE ALL AGREE

10:26:07.496 --> 10:26:08.097
ON THAT AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE

10:26:08.163 --> 10:26:08.964
ON THAT.

10:26:09.031 --> 10:26:11.634
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEANER CENTER

10:26:11.700 --> 10:26:13.836
MONEY.

10:26:13.903 --> 10:26:15.004
THE CLEAR FINE -- IT DOES SOUND

10:26:15.070 --> 10:26:15.905
LIKE THE AUTHORS WILLING TO HAVE

10:26:15.971 --> 10:26:17.740
EXPLICIT LANGUAGE THAT

10:26:17.806 --> 10:26:20.676
INFORMATION CAN'T BE SOLD --

10:26:20.743 --> 10:26:23.145
WHICH I THINK ADDRESSES A LOT OF

10:26:23.212 --> 10:26:25.814
THE CONCERNS I ALSO THINK JUST

10:26:25.881 --> 10:26:27.016
TO BE CLEAR MY UNDERSTANDING.

10:26:27.082 --> 10:26:28.717
WHEN?

10:26:28.784 --> 10:26:31.687
OPPONENTS SUGGESTED THAT YOU HAD.

10:26:31.754 --> 10:26:35.190
TO YOU HAD TO PAY FOR THE FOR

10:26:35.257 --> 10:26:36.058
THE PRIVILEGE OF WHAT WAS

10:26:36.125 --> 10:26:36.759
OFFERED.

10:26:36.825 --> 10:26:38.494
I UNDERSTOOD THAT IN A DIFFERENT

10:26:38.560 --> 10:26:40.095
WAY NOT THAT YOU HAD.

10:26:40.162 --> 10:26:41.630
TO PUT DOWN MONEY HERE RIGHT IT

10:26:41.697 --> 10:26:43.432
CHECKER HAVE SOMETHING TAKEN OUT

10:26:43.499 --> 10:26:44.667
OF YOUR CREDIT CARD.

10:26:44.733 --> 10:26:46.035
BUT RATHER IF YOU WANT TO

10:26:46.101 --> 10:26:49.571
EXERCISE THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT.

10:26:49.638 --> 10:26:52.341
THE YOU LOSE THEN THE BENEFIT OF

10:26:52.408 --> 10:26:54.543
BEING A MEMBER OF THE LAW AND I

10:26:54.610 --> 10:26:56.345
GET THAT AND THAT'S WHAT LOYALTY

10:26:56.412 --> 10:26:57.212
IS.

10:26:57.279 --> 10:26:59.348
I MEAN THAT IS THE PROCESS RIGHT

10:26:59.415 --> 10:27:01.650
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU

10:27:01.717 --> 10:27:02.685
BUT REFER TO IT WHEN YOU

10:27:02.751 --> 10:27:03.385
SPENDING YOUR MONEY WITH SOME

10:27:03.452 --> 10:27:03.852
YOU GET A DISCOUNT.

10:27:03.919 --> 10:27:06.789
BUT CURRENTLY THERE'S NO COST TO

10:27:06.855 --> 10:27:08.958
BE A MEMBER OF THE LOYALTY.

10:27:09.024 --> 10:27:11.327
PROGRAM.

10:27:11.393 --> 10:27:13.929
BUT IF YOU WANT.

10:27:13.996 --> 10:27:16.165
TO ASK THAT YOUR INFORMATION NOT

BE SHARED OR SOLD.

10:27:18.600 --> 10:27:21.637
YOU CAN LOSE THE BENEFIT AND

10:27:21.704 --> 10:27:24.239
THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND IT IS IT'S

10:27:24.306 --> 10:27:26.075
IT'S A LOSS OF THE BENEFIT OF

10:27:26.141 --> 10:27:28.410
BEING LOYAL TO A SPECIFIC.

10:27:28.477 --> 10:27:30.412
COMPANY OR AT AND BY THE WAY

10:27:30.479 --> 10:27:31.814

DON'T WANT IT. TO IS SOON THEN

10:27:33.615 --> 10:27:35.684

AND TO BE PART OF THAT PROGRAM

10:27:46.095 --> 10:27:47.429
OR WHETHER IT'S BETTER FOR ME TO

10:27:47.496 --> 10:27:49.865
OPT OUT AND NOT BE PART OF THAT.

10:27:49.932 --> 10:27:51.934
SHOULD BE MY CHOICE RIGHT.

10:27:52.001 --> 10:27:53.635
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT THE

10:27:53.702 --> 10:27:55.204
WAY YOU'RE CHARACTERIZING IT.

10:27:55.270 --> 10:27:58.340
IT'S IF I WANT TO PROTECT MY

10:27:58.407 --> 10:27:59.274
PRIVACY RIGHT.

10:27:59.341 --> 10:28:01.577
I'M GONNA SACRIFICE THE BENEFITS

10:28:01.643 --> 10:28:03.412

UP A BENEFIT TO PROTECT MY

10:28:09.218 --> 10:28:10.519
PRIVACY.

10:28:10.586 --> 10:28:11.820
AND THAT IS A CHOICE WE WE MAKE

10:28:11.887 --> 10:28:13.322
WE MAKE CHOICES EVERY DAY WE

10:28:13.389 --> 10:28:14.556
MAKE A CHOICE WHETHER WE'RE

10:28:14.623 --> 10:28:15.257

I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND I'M

NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION IN

10:28:23.799 --> 10:28:25.167
THEIR DATABASE.

THEN YOU CHOICE CHOOSE TO PAY

10:28:27.202 --> 10:28:28.504
THE PRICES THAT EVERYONE ELSE

PAYS.

10:28:29.505 --> 10:28:31.407
I AGREE THAT THAT IS TO BE ONE

10:28:31.473 --> 10:28:32.608
OF THE BENEFITS OF BEING A LOYAL
