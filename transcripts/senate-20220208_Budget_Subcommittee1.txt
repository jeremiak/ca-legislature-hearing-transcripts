OUT FOR- MESA ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT AND CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIAL FROM THE GHYLL ROYD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AMANDA REEDY THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR FROM THE GILROY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WINNER GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MICHAEL R. FERRIS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND MICHAEL FONG FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OUR ME JUST SAY TWO QUICK THINGS BEFORE WE GO TO MR MESA. ARE THE FIRST ONE IS THAT I SPOKE TO THE GILROY CITY COUNCIL LAST NIGHT REMOTELY IT MENTIONED THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE WOULD HERE BE HERE FROM THE GO AWRY SCHOOL DISTRICT- TODAY THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT. AND SECOND POINT. ARM ALL THINGS STAFF WERE CHILD CARE USED TO BE IN THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE ESSENTIALLY AND LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS MOVED MINISTRATION FULLY IN THE ADMINISTRATION IT WAS ALSO MOVED- COMMITTEE WISE FROM SUBBAN TO SUB THREE HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE. EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND AFTER SCHOOL WESTILL HAVE PRE K. T. K. SO THERE'S A PORTION OF THAT. BOB BOB THAT WE STILL HAVE WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF SOMEONE WITH THAT WILL GO TO THE FIVE OF PANELISTS I MENTIONED AND WE'LL DO IT IN ORDER. WILL BEGIN WITH MISTER MASSA THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF THE GILROY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT A WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE SIR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE WITH ME. ABOVE ALL OVER MINNESOTA ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT AND CHIEF IS OFFICIAL FOR YOUR UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. HERE WITH ME TODAY AS YOU MENTIONED TERRORISM AND THE READING PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR. FOR OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS A BIT ABOVE GILROY UNIFIED WE HAVE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS. ABOUT 59% OF THOSE STUDENTS FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF FUNDING FOR LOW INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS OR FOSTER STUDENTS. OF WE ARE ONE OF THOSE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR OF POOL FUNDED CONSTRICTS. SO THAT MEANS WORSE YOU ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ACES. ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND NOW WE'RE REALLY THANKFUL AND GRATEFUL. ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS YOU LOVE FUNDING. THAT WE HAVE PUT TO USE TO EXPAND OUR SERVICES TO OUR NEEDY COMMUNITY HEARING GILROY- OUR DISTRICT IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE CITY OF GILROY- BUT WE'RE STRUGGLING- TO STAFF OR PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE- SPRAY THE LAY. SHORTAGE IN OUR ECONOMY. SO WHAT WE IS WE LEVERAGE OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP. TO DELIVER THE SERVICE. ARE COMMUNITY PARTNERS NO THE FAMILIES OF THE STUDENTS KNOW THAT NEED. THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND I WANNA THANK AMONG THE READING FOR BEING WITH US TODAY AMANDA PLEASE TELL THEM HOW WE LEVERAGE OUR COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERSHIPS- TO THE DELIVER THE NEEDED SERVICES BUT WE HAVE- WE WITH OUR COMMUNITY HEARING YOUR- THANK YOU ARE ALSO AND I REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION PARTNERS THEY ARE. VITAL IN IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS THEY KNOW AS ALSO SAID THEY KNOW OUR STUDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT THEY KNOW THE NEEDS OF OUR SCHOOLS AND- IT ALSO HELPS TO BUILD THE PIPELINE WITH. WITH TEACHERS STUDIES ARE STAFF OFTEN THEY'RE- BILINGUAL BICULTURAL. COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE SUPPORTING. SO OFTEN IT'S EVEN SIBLINGS OR NEIGHBORS FROM FROM FROM WHERE THEY'VE GROWN UP- I WANT TO REALLY THINK THIS BODY FOR THE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DURING THE PANDEMIC THE HOW THAT ALLOWED US TO REALLY GET INNOVATIVE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE AS I SAID THE STAFF WERE REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT SUPPORTING THAT THE KIDS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT FIRST TO RELEASED. FIND NEW WAYS OF SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITY- AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS SUCH AS THAT THIS YELLOW KEY FUNDING IS BUILT ON SUCH A STRONG FOUNDATION OF ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND THAT'S- IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THAT GOING- AND I JUST WANT TO SHOUT OUT TO MICHAEL FUNK DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN HE HAD HIS FIRESIDE CHATS HE WOULD ALWAYS AND IT WAS MADE WITH LOVE AND I KNOW FOR MYSELF AND A LOT OF THE- PARTNERS THAT I WORK WITH. THAT WAS WHAT GUIDED US THROUGH LEAD LEAD WITH LEFT WHAT WE GONNA DO HOW IMAGES HOUSES TO WORK WHAT HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. LEGAL STUFF AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHAT GUIDED US- WE RE APPRECIATE CITY THE INCREASE AND THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THAT WAS A- REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF. HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TOKEEP OUR DOORS OPEN NOW BECAUSE OF THAT IT RATE INCREASES BUT IN THE PAST. THE DO A SMALL INCREASE IN FOR OUR STAFF. AND THAT ALLOWED US TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN- FOR RIGHT NOW DURING THIS SPECIALLY DURING JANUARY. WHEN IT WAS SO TOUGH- WE DO HAVE. AS I I'VE WORKED WITH ARE OUT TO A COMMITTEE ARE TO SAY WE WILL NEED TO PAY A WAGE WANTING THE PAY FOR A STAFF SO THEY CAN DO THIS JOB JUST OF HOW LOVE IT BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT- OF THE CAN ARE PARTNER AGENCIES HAD WAS BECAUSE THERE'S NO COLOR BILLS AND THE FUNDING IS SEPARATE FROM ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THE L. O. P. S. AS SEPARATE THEY'RE NOT SURE. IT'S NOT AS NOT AS KNOWN AS SMART- IS MORE UNCERTAIN HOW ONGOING THAT WILL BE AND SO THEY HAVE CONCERNS WITH INCREASING THE PAY RATE FOR STAFF- WHAT BASE BASED ON THAT AND YOU KNOW CALL IT WOULD HELP THEM TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. BUT ON THAT GOING- THIS ONGOING COSTS. THEY ALSO MENTIONED THEY HAVE THEY HAVE TO GO WITH THE DISTRICTS FOR PEACE THEY HAVE TO TAKE WHEN I SAID LET'S LET'S PAY THEM THEY SAID HOLD ON HAVE TO DO THEY HAVE TO DO AGENCIES SO THIS HAVE TO GO WITH THE DISTRICTS FIGURE OUT. AS OF. SAID WE'RE DOING FUNDED WERE VERY BLAH. HEARING SO WE ALREADY HAVE. ENOUGH FOR. BAY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR ELEMENTARY- SO WE ALREADY OPENED TO BILL SCHOOL PRO THAT WERE IN NEED OF IF PROGRAM. LIKELY A SCHOOL THAT WERE SUPPORT JUST SIX LEARNING OPPORTUNITY. WAS BENEFICIAL AND WE HAVE TWO NEW MIDDLE SCHOOLS OPEN AND WE HOPE NEXT YEAR WITH THE INCREASE IN FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE L. O. P. M. I DO BUT I DO TO HIGHLIGHT THE MOST DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE DO SO THEY WILL THEY WILL NEED. A DEDICATED FUNDING FOR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDES KIDS THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ROUTE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEN WHEN THEY GET THE HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THINGS REALLY START TO GET TOUGH FOR THEM OFTENTIMES WE END UP JUST SAYING OKAY WE'RE OUT WE'RE DONE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR THAT SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS ALL THE WAY THROUGH- THE- ONE CONCERN THAT I HAVE. IS THAT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS VITAL IN OPERATING THESE PROGRAMS WE BENEFITTED FOR YEARS AGO FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE SUMMER MATTERS CAMPAIGN. AND I HAD KEY BRECKENRIDGE TEACHING ME HOW TO RUN SUMMER PROGRAM AND DESIGNING THE MODEL THAT WE THAT WE HAVE THE PARTNERSHIPS AND- THERE IS AN AMAZING SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR EXPANDED LEARNING ALREADY IN PLACE. FOR ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE SKILL OPS FIVE SEPARATE FROM MATH. AND THEY ALREADY HAVE. THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND I JUST WANT TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A NEED. I FEEL FOR. ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ESPECIALLY FOR NEW ELEAZER GONNA BE BRINGING OUT A PROGRAM THAT THEY DN'T HAVE THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE THOSE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PARTNER AGENCIES- THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY VITAL THAT THEY- GET THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THEY CAN BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND BUILD THE TRUST THAT WE'VE- DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS- WHEN WE- ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY APPRECIATE WAS AT YELLOW P. WAS THE EQUITY FOCUS. AND REALLY. FOCUSING ON THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT NEED THE PROGRAM THE MOST. SO I WANT TO SHARE A QUICK SLIDE JUST TO SHOW. THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS WHEN WE YOU KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTENTIONAL ABOUT TARGETING THE RIGHT STUDENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE A LOT AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY CAN COME INTO THE PROGRAM. BUT IN THE PAST YOU CAN SEE HERE THERE SANTA CLARA COUNTY THIS IS OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS. AND OUR FOOD IS LUNCH RATES. PER COUNTY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THIS WAS BACK IN SUMMER TWENTY NINETEEN. WE SAID APPLICATIONS OUT TO THE TARGETED STUDENTS TO WAS WE'VE ALWAYS TARGETED THE SAME THE SAME TARGET STUDENTS AND THIS WAS WHAT WE GOT BACK SO IN ALL THE STUDENTS WHO TURNED RETURN OBLIGATIONS. THIS LAST SUMMER SUMMER TWENTY ONE WE ACTUALLY MADE PHONE CALLS TO FAMILIES WE HAVEN'T STOPPED BILINGUAL STAFF MAKING PERSONAL PHONE CALLS TO FAMILIES LETTING THEM KNOW ABOUT THE NEEDS ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND WHAT IT CAN PROVIDE. AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THE DRASTIC DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF ENGLISH LEARNERS THAT WE HAD IN WORLD FOR THE PERCENT OF ENGLISH AND WE HAD INVOLVED AND THE FREE REDUCED LUNCH- SO THAT THOSE TARGETED PHONE CALLS NOT INTENTIONALLY REALLY HELPED. TO SURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY WE ALSO WITH THE O. P. PARTNERED WITH ONE OF OUR AGE PARTNER TO DO LIST SESSIONS SO WE CAN GET IN FROM AND ON WHAT WHAT THEY NEED AND HOW WE CAN SUPPORT THE BEST BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE HAVE GREAT PROGRAMS WE NEED TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN THAT ARE THAT WE'RE TARGETING- AND SO THAT'S THE INNOVATION OF THIS YELLOW P. FUNDING ALLOWS IT. IS VITAL- THE OTHER THING THAT I DO WANT TO. BRING UP IS OUR SUMMER OUR SUMMER PROGRAM SO WE'VE BEEN. WE'VE HAD A VERY STRONG SUMMER PROGRAM FOR YEARS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED LAST SUMMER WAS. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE. COHESIVE SOLID PROGRAM. WHERE THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE L. O. G. FUNDING WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE TEACHERS CUSHION INTO INTERVENTION AND THEY WERE REALLY ABLE TO FOCUS ON SMALL GROUP INTERVENTION THE TEACHERS LOVED IT. ABSOLUTELY LOVED TEACHING SUMMER BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO RUN THE WHOLE CLASSROOM ARE STUFF FREE WILL TO DO THAT AND ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS. TO THE INTERVENTION. COMPONENTS AND THEY LOVED IT IT. WAS REALLY POWERFUL IT MADE FOR A CONSISTENT COHESIVE DAY FOR THE STUDENTS- AND MY CONCERN WITH THE NINE HOURS FOR SUMMER IS THAT IT WILL FORCE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE THE HOUSE LIKE THREE HOURS IN THE MORNING OF A SCHOOL AND SIX HOURS OF AFTER SCHOOL AND THEN YOU HAVE A SEPARATE PROGRAM AND THAT REALLY ISN'T THE HIGHEST THE BEST. MODEL SO FROM US I WOULD LOVE IT IF THERE WAS FLEXIBILITY FOR LIKE A SEVEN TO NINE HOURS A DAY OR INSTEAD OF SPECIFIC HOURS MAYBE IT'S YOU KNOW RANGE OF TWO HUNDRED HOURS- OR SOMETHING FOR THE SUMMER SO THAT SO THAT DISTRICTS SO MAYBE AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS AS DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND BUILD THESE CONNECTIONS SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE REALLY FOCUS ON THE QUALITY I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THE SYSTEMS I'M SUPER FIRST. LINE IS THE CALL STANDARDS QUALITY. AND COULD VERY CLEARLY SPELL OUT THIS IS WHY A QUALITY. LOOK LIKE THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT. THIS IS YOU KNOW WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT SO I REALLY. WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT I WILL CONSIDER MY CONCERN IS HELPING TRYING TO MAKE A NINE HOUR I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR FAMILIES THEY NEED THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT AN ASPEN SCHOOL YEAR THAT MAKES SENSE. AND FOR SUMMER AT LEAST WE'RE GETTING UP AND RUNNING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE FOR THAT DISTRICTS CAN REALLY- POCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND I HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY BUT I'M GOING TO STOP HIM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I'M SURE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME QUESTIONS WHEN WE GET THROUGH ALL THE SPEAKERS. ARE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO WIN A GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEAH GRANT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE YELLOW P. PROGRAM. THE COST OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF THREE POINT FOUR BILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR THE L. O. PROGRAM PROVIDING AN ONGOING TOTAL OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION. THIS BUILDS UPON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INVESTMENT OF ONE BILLION I'M GOING PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. AND THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION ONE TIME- IN ONE TIME FUNDS WORKING TO. THE INTENDED FIVE BILLION. DOLLAR INVESTMENT BY 2526% TO STATUTE. ALL ELEAZAR GUARD LISTS OF COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS ARE ENCOURAGED TO OFFER SUBSIDIZED YELLOW PT PROGRAM SERVICES TO ALL STUDENTS. USING A FEE SCHEDULE THAT CONSIDERS FAMILY INCOME IN THE ABILITY TO PAY. I GIVEN THIS INCREASES TO THE PROGRAMS ONGOING BUDGET BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES PROVIDING ELEAZAR- BETTER HAVE ABOVE SEVENTY FIVE AT OR ABOVE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT- UNDUPLICATED PEOPLE PERCENTAGE. RATE OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT AND THAT'S INCREASING THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO RATE OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PER ADA- FOR LA'S BELOW THE 75% U. P. P. THE RATE IS APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY SEVEN. EIGHTY EIGHT THAT'S UP FROM. SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO PER ADA PROVIDES A HIGHER RETALIATES ABOVE THE THRESHOLD 80% SO WE CHANGED IT. FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR FROM ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF CUSHION FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. TO ALLOW LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO CONTINUE BUILDING CAPACITY FOR THEIR ELO PROGRAM OFFERINGS FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO EXPAND TO FUNDS RECEIVED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND THAT MIRRORS THE SIMILAR TREATMENT THAT WAS GIVEN TO FUNDS RECEIVED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WHICH THE CURRENT YEAR. ALSO AUDIT PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WILL NOT BE ENFORCED UNTIL THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. FISCAL YEAR. ON THE AUDIT P. SPECIFICALLY IN RESPONSE TO MANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS WITH ELLIE GAYS IN THAT. THE TOTAL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE YELLOW PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES A PROPORTIONATE POTTED PENALTY RELATIVE TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS NOT PROVIDED. I'M ACCESS OR OFFERED PROVIDED OR OFFERED ACCESS TO THE L. O. PROGRAM SERVICES- AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS OR HOURS FOUND OUT OF COMPLIANCE. SIMILAR TO THE EXISTING INSTRUCTIONAL DAY PENALTIES USED FOR- OR ADA INSTEAD OF THE COMPLETE LOSS OF FUNDING THAT IS IN CURRENT LAW. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TRAILER BILL PROPOSES SEVERAL TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO FURTHER FACILITATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM. BY ELEAZAR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I THINK WE'RE HOLDING AT THAT AND TELL THE END. WE ARE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO MICHAEL FERRIS ARE FERRIS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MR FOR. THE CREATURE ON THE MORNING A TERM. OF WE DON'T HAVE- ANY RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS. WE'RE THRILLED THAT AND WILL PUBLISH AND ALL IN THE COME WEEKS- AS WE ARE REVIEWING WE DID ONE TO HAVE A FEW KEY ASPECTS THE PROPOSED THAT RAY FROM INITIAL. AND THAT WE WILL BE CLOSED REVIEWING. I'M THE FIRST IS THE UPEI OF IMPLEMENTATION WE HAVE HEARD FROM DISTRICTS THAT THEY HAVE FACED CHALLENGES WE COULD WITH EXPANDING THEIR ELO P. PROGRAMS AND CURRENT YEAR DUE TO A VARIETY OF REASONS. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY A STAFFING SHORTAGES- ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DELAYS THE PROGRAM APARTMENTS FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- GIVEN THESE ISSUES A SLOWER PHASE IN A FUNDING. COULD ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED. SECONDLY IS THE- BLAME OF RATES AND PROGRAM HAVE TO TEARS AND DISTRICTS WITH SIMILAR INSTANCE FUNDING BUT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN THE MONTH OF THE STUDENTS OF THEIR- OWN CARDS THIRDS. OF FOR EXAMPLE AN NBA WITH 70% OTHER STUDENTS BEING. DUPLICATED PUPILS LESS STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOUTH. WILL RECEIVE A LITTLE OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER UNDUPLICATED PUPIL. AND BE REQUIRED TO SERVE HALF OF THOSE 70% OTHER STUDENTS- BUT ADDITION WITH 80% UNDUPLICATED PUPILS WOULD RECEIVE UP TO. TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE FUNDING AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT. ALMOST IN REAL ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE ARE ALL ENGLISH LEARNER FAST YOU OR ON. LOW INCOME STUDENT- TO A AND THEY HAVE TO SERVICE ALL STUDENTS WHOSE PARENT OR GUARDIAN- REQUEST PLACED IN THE PROGRAM. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE- PROPOSED FUNDING RATES MAY NOT BE ALIGNED WITH HIS PROGRAM EXPECTATIONS. ARE THREATS BUT WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS PROGRAM PARTICIPATION TRACKING. UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ARE BY THE PROGRAM. ALSO PROGRAM PARTICIPATION DATA WILL HELP DETERMINE WHETHER THE. PROGRAM IS MEETING ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. AND ON THE LEFT SB WE WANT IS. A ALIGNMENT WITH OTHER AFTER PRO. EVEN AT THE ALREADY. FUNDING FOR SCHOOL FOR IN THE FORM OF A ACE IN FRONT CENTURY. OF LEARNING COMMUNITIES. THERE IS A AND EXPLORING CHANGES THAT WOULD BE MADE SELECT ON YOU KNOW FOR PROGRAM COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. AND WOULD BE A INTEGRATED INTO ONE OVER ARCHING PROGRAM. THAT INCLUDES OUR COMMON SEPARATES ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WITH APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND LASTLY ON OUR LIST OF PANELISTS WILL GO TO MICHAEL FUNK FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. MORE INSURANCE. THANK YOU ALL OF CABALLERO ADAM FROM GILROY FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR WORK THERE MANY ELEAZAR THE STATE THAT ARE DOING INNOVATIVE THINGS JUST LIKE YOU. THE CITY IS GRATEFUL THAT IM PRESENTING TODAY AND TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT. TONY THURMOND. CD IS GRATEFUL FOR THE PROPOSED THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR THE EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM ACCELERATING THE FIVE BILLION DOLLAR GOAL THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST BUDGET. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ALLOTTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL BASED PUBLICLY FUNDED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE NATIONAL LEADER AND INNOVATOR FOR MENTIONING HOW LEARNING COULD BE ENHANCED AND EXPANDED. THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS DOES THE NAME CHANGE FROM AFTER SCHOOL TO EXPANDED LEARNING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. WITH THE ROBUST E. L. O. P. FUNDING K. TWELVE EDUCATORS AND COMMUNITY EDUCATORS WILL COLLABORATE TOGETHER IN A WAY WE ONLY DREAMED OF BEFORE. STUDENTS THAT HAVE EXISTED. ON THE MARGINS. WE'LL BE SEEING SUPPORTED. KNOWN AND PREPARED. IN A MANNER THAT'S WHEN WE SAY LEAD WITH LOVE AND THAT'S BEEN OUR MANTRA. THAT'S THE HARD WORK IS ACTUALLY. WORKING TO KNOW STUDENTS SEE THEM REPAIR THEM. POWERFUL. THE ONLY A LEADERS MUST RESIST. STARTING WITH THE RULES AND COMPLIANCE. AND INSTEAD LEAD WITH AN AUTHENTIC EXPLORATION OF OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES NEED AND DESERVE. THAT IS OUR PARTICULARLY WITH THIS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANTAMENDMENTS TO THE TRAILER BILL THAT WILL FACILITATE JUST THAT. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND I WANT TO MENTION IS WHAT MADE ALREADY MENTIONED IS THE PROPORTIONAL WITHHOLDING. OF THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES APPORTIONMENT. FOR FAILURE TO MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS. BEFORE THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THE RISK OF IMPLEMENTING THE ELO PROGRAM WAS TOO HIGH. IF THEY FAILED AT SOME PART OF THIS THEY COULD LOSE EVERY OF EVERY DOLLAR OF THE APPORTIONMENT. AS WILL NOW HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO DO THEIR BEST. BE CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING SEVERELY PENALIZED TRAILER BILL AND WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO REFINE THE PROPOSAL IN WEEKS AHEAD. AND THE CITY HAS BEEN PROVIDING MANY VARIED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ELEAZAR TO RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COACHING. AND THIS CORRECT OUR SYSTEM IS GETTING STRETCHED THEM SUPPORT FOR EXPANDED LEARNING FUNDED BY ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. IS REACHING OUT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY OF THE EDUCATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND COME INTO THEIR MEETINGS BUILDING THEIR CAPACITY SO THEY CAN HELP SUPPORT AT LEAST THROUGH THIS IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AND- YES MICHAEL MANY OF OUR ELEAZAR BEEN STRUGGLING BUT THE MORE WE ARE. MATCHING DISTRICTS LIKE GILROY WITH DISTRICTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING OR SEEN THEM FIND A WAY AND SEE THE POSSIBILITIES AND START OFF DOWN THE PATH OF IMPLEMENTATION. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST. THANK YOU FOR OF YOUR TESTIMONY AND IT'S RARE THAT SOMEBODY TELLS US TO. PUT THE ROLE SECOND INTENTIONALLY AND AUTHENTICITY FIRST THAT WAS A FASCINATING TESTIMONY. ARE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR QUESTIONS AND I AM GOING TO START AND I WANT TO WORK. TO DIRECTOR QUESTION AMANDA REEDY GILROY AND FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. I COULD TELL THAT YOU COULD TAKE UP OUR ENTIRE HEARING THIS MORNING WITH YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE PROGRAM AND SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU LIMITED YOURSELF THERE FOR SECOND- IF FIRST YOU MADE A VERY INTERESTING COMMENT AND HAND IN THE CHART. THAT TO PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM CHANGED WHEN YOU DID MUCH MORE PERSONAL OUTREACH WE NEEDED PHONE CALLS INSTEAD OF. ANOTHER METHOD I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP DOING THAT IF THAT WAS A RESOURCES ISSUE. UP BECAUSE IT OBVIOUSLY LEAD TO SUCCESS. BECAUSE WE HAVE A YELLOW DEFINING YES WE CONTINUE TO DO IT AND I'M SORRY- COULD DO FOR THE UNINITIATED THAT ARE WATCHING AT LEAST ONCE COULD YOU SAY WHAT THE ACRONYM ELO PIECED AND- EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM THANK YOU- SO YOU INTEND TO KEEP DOING THAT. ABSOLUTELY AT ACTUAL BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE WE ARE NOW. WELL AS I MENTIONED HAPPENS MANY LISTENING SESSIONS WE REALIZE OUR OTHER STUFF THAT WAS MAKING THOSE PHONE CALLS WOULD COME BACK TO ME I UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT AVAILABLE SO I WOULD. HEAR FROM THE STAFF AND THEY WOULD TELL ME WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH FAMILIES SUPPORT THEY NEEDED AND THAT'S AGAIN WHERE THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION PARTNERS. COME IN IS YOU KNOW THERE WERE FAMILIES WHO NEEDED FOOD AND CLOTHING AND THE OUR COMMUNITY HAS A PROVIDES A LOT OF RESOURCES BUT THERE WAS ADDITIONAL NEEDS- RENT ASSISTANCE. AND SO OUR CEOS WERE ABLE. TO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITH. WITH MORE RESOURCES THE COMMUNITY AND FIND WAYS TO HELP THE FAMILIES THAT THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN THE DISTRICT- EITHER NOT REALLY ARE. NOT WHAT WE DO BUT OUR PARTNER AGENCIES DO. AND SO THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND RESOURCES FOR FAMILIES- SO REALLY HAVING THAT COLLABORATION. WAS VITAL IN HEARING ABOUT. WHAT FAMILIES WERE SHARING IT MADE ME REALIZE YOU KNOW I HOW MOST MY EAR TO THE GROUND I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY I HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. AND WE REALLY NEED TO HEAR FROM THESE FAMILIES BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S CHANGED. SO DURING THE PANDEMIC EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED AS- AND WHEN WE REALLY REALLY NEED THIS THE CONTINUED FLEXIBILITY AND THIS INCREASES FUNDING. BY EIGHT I DO FEEL LIKE WOW IT'S FAST IT'S A LOT BUT THAT IS WHY WE'RE ABLE TO GET THE POSITIONS HIGHER THAT WE NEED TO GET WERE ABLE TO GET IT MAKES THESE BIG CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN THOSE TAKE TIME. AND SO IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY UP FRONT TO BE ABLE TO SAY WE NEED TO INVEST IN THIS THIS IS COMING LET'S BUILD THIS. I'M NOT SURE IF WE WOULD BE MAKING THE MOVES THAT WE'RE MAKING TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH FAMILIES AND HEAR WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. AND BUILD THE SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU AND YOU WALKED INTO MY OTHER QUESTION DURING YOUR COMMENTS. YOU ACTUALLY LISTED A FEW. SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENTS- TO THE FOR. TO YOU WOULD- OF FOR HELP. IS THERE ANY THAT YOU DIDN'T LIST IN YOUR COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE YOU CALLED OUT TO THE COMMITTEES THAT WERE WHERE OF ANY. OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU THINK COULD BE MADE FROM THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP YOU FROM THE PROGRAM. I AM SO GLAD YOU ASKED BECAUSE AS SOON AS I STOPPED I WENT. FOR ONE. SO YES THE- CIVILITY FOR EASY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ATTENDANCE- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY WE'VE HAD AT THIS TIME. AND BECAUSE- BECAUSE WE ARE SO SHORT STAFFED- WE ARE NOT WE ARE STILL ON THAT ARE CREEPING PANDEMIC LEVELS WITH STAFFING AND SO THE INCREASES THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. WAS BASED ON THE ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY INCREASE HAVE HELPED SOME. BUT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF INCREASING PAY RATES EVEN MORE SO THAT WE CAN PAY A LIVABLE WAGE- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE STAFF. EDUCATED TO DO THEIR WORK AND- WE STILL NEED MORE TIME WE'RE WE'RE SO NOT OUT SITES TOP OF THAT. SO WE'RE MORE MEETING NEEDS OF THE MOST NEEDY OUR STAFF KNOW REGARDLESS IF THEY HEAR FROM FAMILIES OF FOSTER USE OR HOMELESS YOUTH OR ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE FOR YOU KNOW FAMILIES THAT REALLY ARE IN NEED. ADAM GET A MAN MAKE IT HAPPEN BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO THE MASS ADDITIONS LIKE WE WANT TO. AND SO WE WILL NEED FLEXIBILITY WITH BASES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ATTENDANCE FOR THIS YEAR THERE'S WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE TARGETS. BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT ONCE WE GET THE SYSTEMS UP AND RUNNING AND WE START INCREASING SOUTH PAY AND WE MAKE ALL THESE CHANGES. WE WILL HAVE THAT WE WILL BE BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE WE WERE MAKING. IN MEETING OUR TENANTS TARGETS. AND SO ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY WOULD BE VERY VITAL AND I AND I DO WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND DEALER PEAK THEY- THEY REALLY GO. THE REALLY GOING TOGETHER THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE WITH ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ARE. PHENOMENAL AND SO IT INVESTMENT IS IT IS VERY WISE IN MY MIND TO INVEST IN BUILDING ON THAT FOUNDATION THAT'S ALREADY THERE- THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT. BECAUSE ONE OF THE- EXCUSE ME ONE OF THE REASONS. WE STRUCTURED THE HEARING TODAY WAS REALLY TO LOOK AT THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE THREE PROGRAMS. AND SO. THAT IS REALLY HELPFUL AND I HAVE A NIECE. WHO WITH HER HUSBAND AND YOUNG KID MOVED INTO GILROY IN A MINUTE TYLER SHE- PICKED A GOOD SCHOOL SYSTEM- AFTER TESTIMONY. AND THEN LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A QUESTION. ARM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. IN HIS COMMENTS OF THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR WHICH I GOT A KICK OUT OF BECAUSE HE SAID THEY THEY HAVEN'T RELEASED A REPORT YET THAT'S COMING AND THEN THEY HAD A LONG LIST OF THINGS THAT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE REPORT. A SO THAT WAS GOOD BUT- OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST SAID THAT. THERE WOULD BE A HIGHER. AMOUNT FOR STUDENT IF THE- THRESHOLD. FOR THE EXPANDED WARNING OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS. WAS 80% AND SEVENTY FIVE INSTEAD OF SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. MORE IS GONNA ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SORT OF HOW YOU LANDED ON 75% AND IF. IN AND- LEADING UP TO YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. YES LEENA GRANT PARK IN A FINANCE SO WE DID MODEL VARIOUS PERCENTAGE KIND OF THRESHOLDS AND IN THE END WE REALLY WANTED TO BE AS EQUITABLE AS POSSIBLE AND HOW WE DISTRIBUTED THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A LARGER SHARE OF FUNDS TO ELEAZAR THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UNDUPLICATED PUPILS AND ALSO TO FULFILL THAT ORIGINAL VISION OF THE L. KILO PROGRAM. IN THE VIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS THAT ALL AND LIAISE ABOVE THE HIGHER RATES ARE AND THAT YOU JUST DID AN ACRONYM YOU PPL SORRY THE- UCBCP IS UNDUPLICATED PEOPLE PERCENTAGE YOU. YES AND- AND THEN APPROACH THAT WE TOOK IT REALLY MIRRORS THE ROUGHLY SIXTY FORTY SPLIT BETWEEN KIND OF THE HIGHER RATE AND THE LOWER RATE FROM THE FIRST YEAR FUNDING SO WE WANTED TO KEEP THE TRUE TO THAT SAME KIND OF VISION AS WE DID IN THE FIRST YEAR IN THE SECOND YEAR BUT WE JUST HAD A HIGHER. DOLLAR AMOUNT. TO WORK WITH AND SO WE ENDED UP. WE MODEL THE DIFFERENT. THIS FIVE PER PROVIDED US YOU KNOW SIXTY PERCENT- OF THE FOUR POINT FOUR POCKET TO THOSE ELEAZAR ABOVE PERCENTAGE. WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER ARE. THE CHOICES. THAT YOU MADE BUT I WOULD JUST. I DON'T DISAGREE. NECESSARILY JUST. BROKE WE DO HAVE AN INTEREST OF COURSE. IN THE BEST OF ALL WORLDS WHICH IS THE BROADEST PARTICIPATION AND THE BEST AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TO THEM ONCE THEY PARTICIPATE SO. ARM AS MUCH AS YOU LANDED ON SOMETHING I HOPE YOU WOULD JUST. TAKE A LOOK AT IT OVER TIME MAYBE EVEN THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS TO SEE THAT IT CONTINUES TO WORK THAT. I'M FIVE HARD TO THE QUEST AND SO I'M GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF- IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. SANDRA BULLOCK WITHOUT FEAR. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING YOUR TESTIMONY IS VERY VERY HELPFUL AND VERY EXCITING I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I'M ONE OF THEM HAS TO DO WITH- DO YOU HAVE AND- HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE AN ASUS. OUR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CLC PROGRAMS AND WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES OR SUPPORT ARE PROVIDED FOR THOSE DISTRICTS WHO DO NOT HAVE THESE PROGRAMS IN PLACE. JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO START WHEN. WE WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE SOMETHING ALREADY. ESTABLISHED. IN THIS REVIEW TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR THE- ALEJO FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY OF THE THREE OF YOU. MIGHT START TO SEE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. I DON'T OF THE CLEANING GRANT PARK IN A FINANCE I DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS EXACTLY IN FRONT OF ME I WOULD DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THEY MIGHT HAVE THAT DATA MORE READILY AVAILABLE. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DO YOU HAVE THAT DATA MORE READILY AVAILABLE. MICHAEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- WE ACTUALLY RESTARTED TO DO SOMEONE ELSE'S THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. AND CAME UP WITH A FIGURE OF. OVER A THOUSAND ELEAZAR THE DO NOT HAVE BASES ARE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUT OF COURSE THAT INCLUDES- INDIVIDUAL CHARTERS AND- I THINK- WHAT RIGHT NOW I HAVE STAFF WORKING TO SPLIT IT UP BETWEEN PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS PUBLICLY FUNDED SCHOOL DISTRICTS VERSUS INDIVIDUAL CHARTERS. IT'S A LOT- MAYBE CLOSER TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUT I THINK WE HAVE INSTRUCTED OUR SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR EXPANDED LEARNING WHICH HAS GEOGRAPHIC TEAMS IN IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE THAT ARE PART OF COUNTY OFFICES ABED AND CITY STAFF- INVITING THOSE ELEAZAR DON'T HAVE BASES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. INTO COACHING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OPPORTUNITIES- TO GIVE THEM SUPPORT WERE ALSO ESTABLISHED STARTING LAST FRIDAY WEEKLY OFFICE HOURS. AT THE CD CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EVERY FRIDAY FROM TWELVE TO ONE THIRTY THAT ALLOWS ANY L. A. IN THE STATE TO SIGN UP AND COME IN AND GET DIRECT COACHING. AND SOME OF THAT CULD BE FROM ONE OF THEIR PEERS LIKE GILROY OR FROM SOME OF OUR STAFF WITH. ALL THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF THAT ARE PART OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THURSDAY. AT THEIR MEETING SO WE'RE WE'RE GOING INTO EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE CAN'T TO PROVIDE COACHING AND ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THAT IS THE CHALLENGE IS HOW TO REALLY. PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED AN ACES FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROGRAM. THANK YOU SO MUCH MICHAEL I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT IS BEING DONE TO REACH OUT TO THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE PROGRAMS IN PLACE BECAUSE- UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME THAT ARE VERY VERY- MATCHING NEED. ARMED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- OR THE CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE THREE PROGRAMS. LET'S SEE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT FIRST. ELINA GRANT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK AGAIN I THINK- MICHAEL FONG FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AB BETTER EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THAT BUT I. IT JUST A- GENERAL KIND OF VIEWPOINT THAT WE HAVE IS THAT ASUS IN THE TWENTY FIRST- THE ASUS PROGRAM THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AB. ELEMENTARY MIDDLE SCHOOL PROGRAM IN THE ELO PROPIA LOW P. UP PROGRAM- SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SINGLE KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM AND- WE SEE IT KIND OF. COORDINATING ALL THESE FUNDING STREAMS TO MOVE TOWARDS A SINGLE PROGRAM AND- THAT EXPECTATION. IS THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE KIND OF THE MOST STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE ADOPTED FOR PROGRAM GUIDANCE BUT I LET MY AND- MY CUT MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF. EDUCATION RESPOND YES ARE ARE ASKED FOR MISTER FAULKNER WAS GOING TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE TO MICHAEL'S ON THE PANEL SO. I SAW THE OTHER ONE BLANK. YOU SAID MY SO LET'S GO TO FOR YEAH NO NO FOR. THE ONE ANSWER LAST. WEEK A MISTER. FOR THIS IS THANK SENATOR FOR THE THIS IS THE ONE THAT I'VE SWIMMING IN- FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS BECAUSE- THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EXPANDED LEARNING-OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. IT IS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. ONE OF THE FIRST IS THAT ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY OF COURSE ARE COMPETITIVE GRANTS. AND THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL SITE. ONLY TO SERVE STUDENTS AT THAT SCHOOL SITE. EXCEPT OF COURSE IN SUMMER WITH THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMER FUNDING ANY STUDENT IN ANY SCHOOL CAN ATTEND THE PROGRAM IN THAT DISTRICT. THE ELO PROGRAM. EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM FUNDING IS TO AN ALLEY A AND THE CHOICE OF WHAT SCHOOLS RECEIVE THE FUNDING IS THE LOCAL CHOICE IN THE L. E. EIGHT. THE ELLIE A CAN OF COURSE YOU CAN CHOOSE. TO PARTNER WITH AN OUTSIDE AGENCY AND RUN THE PROGRAM OFF SITE. WERE SEEN SOME DISTRICTS WHO ARE CHOOSING TO PARTNER WITH THEIR LOCAL PARKS AND RECREATION PROGRAM BECAUSE IT THEIR FACILITIES AND THEIR STAFF ARE LOTS OF CREATIVE. APPROACHES TO THIS. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON- MISCONCEPTIONS IS THAT THE LEGISLATION FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM STATES THAT ATTENDANCE IS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENT IN THE FAMILY THE PROGRAM HAS TO BE OFFERED. AT ACCESS HAS TO BE PROVIDED BUT THE ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NEED TO THIS. IT ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THE AT CODE SAYS IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT STUDENTS ATTEND DALY. HOWEVER THAT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT THE ACTUAL REQUIREMENT FOR ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. IS THAT ELEAZAR ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN ATTENDANCE POLICY IN THEIR OWN EARLY RELEASE POLICY. IT WOULDN'T AUDITOR COMES THERE SIMPLY CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY'RE FOLLOWING THEIR OWN POLICY. THE REASON THAT SIGNIFICANT IS BECAUSE WHAT HAS COME UP. MOST PROMINENTLY IS A CONCERN. FOR ELEAZAR OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS- IT HAS WELL OVER THE LAST YEAR AS THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION IS HOW CAN THESE HOW CAN THIS BECOME ONE COMPANY CAN HAVE ONE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE TO ATTEND EVERY DAY FOR A SYSTEM TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUT NOT IN A LOW P. AND SO WE'RE HELPING. DISTRICTS UNDERSTAND THAT THE MENTAL MODELS A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT ACES THEY CAN DESIGN AND THE TENANTS OF EARLY RELEASE POLICY THAT GIVES THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALIGN THIS. AND WE STILL HAVE DISTRICTS TALKING ABOUT TWELVE. WHAT IF A STUDENT CHOOSES THE L. O. PROGRAM INSTEAD OF THE ASUS PROGRAM WOULD WORK WERE REALLY ENCOURAGING DISTRICTS TO THINK ABOUT THIS. AS DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS TO SUPPORT A SINGLE PROGRAM M. AMANDA YOU AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT YOU'RE DOING THAT IN GILROY- WHAT WE'VE TRADITIONALLY DONE IN EDUCATION SILENT IF IT'S A DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES THEN THE CHILDREN CAN'T MIX BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS I'VE SEEN THIS IN THE TWENTY YEARS AROUND THESE PROGRAMS IN THE BAY AREA THE BAY AREA. YOU HAVE A PROGRAM FUNDED FOR SCHOOL AGE CARE ON THIS SIDE OF THE CAMPUS A PROGRAM FOR ACES ON THE SIDE OF THE CAMPUS AND MAY BE A FEE BASED PROGRAM IN A DIFFERENT ROOM AND THOSE CHILDREN WERE ALLOWED TO MIX. AND SO WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO UNRAVEL HOW WE'VE TAUGHT THEM TO THINK. AND NOW THINK ABOUT. THESE AS JUST AS LEYVA SAID AS FUNDING STREAMS. TO SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE. PROGRAM IN AMANDA'S GOT SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF HOW SHE'S. LEVERAGING THE ELO WITH THE ACES FUNDING TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO PAY A LIVING WAGE TO RECRUIT STAFF TO DO MORE TREATED SIX I HOPE THAT GETS CLOSE TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. OKAY- FOR WORKING WITH SCHOOLS THAT TURNED CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ANY AND. WOULD IT BE HELPFUL FOR THE PUBLIC IN PARENTS TO KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE- FUNDING SOURCES ARE AVAILABLE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT THEY CAN START ADVOCATING AND HELP HER LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS. I GUESS I WOULD LOSE A QUESTION DIRECTED ONLY PROBABLY THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MICHAEL FONG. SENATOR WOULD YOU MIND RESTATING THE QUESTION ONE MORE TIME NOT AT ALL AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU IF YOU WOULD FIND IT HELPFUL IF- THE PUBLIC WAS MADE AWARE PARENTS WERE FAMILY MEMBERS WERE MADE AWARE OF THESE. PROGRAMS AND FUNDING AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR STUDENTS IN THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT HAVE THE F. THE PROPOSAL READY ESTABLISHED. ABSOLUTELY OF COURSE PAIRED OUT REACHES A CORE VALUE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE HAVE STAFF DEDICATED TO THAT IT ALSO. PROGRAM STAFF ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT OR DEDICATED TO THAT AND THAT'S CERTAINLY A FOCUS OF. THE WORK OF THE EXPANDED LEARNING DIVISION WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH SOME PARENT GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE EDUCATED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AND THE OPPORTUNITIES- AMANDA MENTIONED LISTENING SESSIONS WITH PARENTS. BUT HERE'S THE TO ME THE BENEFIT OF WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS. HE ARE SOME EARLY EIGHTIES. BECAUSE OF THE STRESS OF. THE ONLY CRIME VIRUS STAFFING TEACHER SHORTAGES QUARANTINES HAVE HAD JUST THIS THIS PROGRAM HAS FELT OVERWHELMING TO THEM AND SOME ELEAZAR SUGGESTING THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT GOING TO TAKE THE FUNDING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM. WE WOULD HOPE THE PARENTS WHO SAW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR CHILD TO RECEIVE. THIS KIND OF OUT OF SCHOOL TIME EXTENDED EXTENDED DAY EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM. WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP ENCOURAGE THEIR ORDER DEDICATION AND THEIR LEADERSHIP TO AT LEAST CONSIDER WORKING WITH US BECAUSE WE CAN HELP. YOU KNOW- MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU MENTIONED. FIRST TIME YOU'VE HEARD SOMEONE SAY DON'T START WITH THE RULES BUT START WITH THE NEEDS OF COURSE THE RULES ARE IMPORTANT WHENEVER SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE NO NO I WOULD EXPECTED YOU WOULD COVER YOURSELF AT SOME POINT IN. DID YOU KNOW DURING THE PANDEMIC OF PANDEMIC. WE CAD DISTRICTS TELLING US WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TELL US WHAT TO DO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TELL US WHAT TO DO CHATS GO FIND OUT WHAT'S YOUR STUDENTS AND FAMILY EEDS THAT COME BACK TO US THEN WORLD WE WILL WORK WITH YOU. TO HELP FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP YOU IN COMPLIANCE. AND MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IT'S THE SAME HERE. WHERE WE ARE AVAILABLE IN OUR RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP COACH DISTRICTS INTO COMPLIANCE ONCE THEY DISCOVER. IN AND EXPLORE WHAT THEIR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES NEED OFCOURSE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN STUDENTS AND FAMILIES HAVE TO BE AWARE THAT THIS EXISTS AND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE. PERFECT AND- ONE LAST QUESTION AND ARE WE. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION AS FAR AS- ACCOUNTABILITY AB ON IT THE SPENDING OF THIS MONEY MEANING ARE WE LOOKING AT WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING TO SEE AS AN OUTCOME OUT OF THESE PROGRAMS AS FAR AS PERFORMANCE FOR THE STUDENTS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR- I COULD'VE MAKE YEAR I KNOW THAT MUCH OF THIS FUNDING IS BEING ALLOCATED BECAUSE OF KOBE DIDN'T THE PANDEMIC AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED WITH AB WITH EDUCATION THE LIMITATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. SO TO COMPENSATE PEOPLE WERE ALLOCATING ALL OF THIS FUNDING TOWARDS- THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAMS ARE WE LOOKING ARE GATHERING ANY DATA TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE HAVE BEEN AT. I AND AS THEIR BEING IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE KEEP THIS- TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROS ARE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE. WE HAVE ONGOING OF. WE HAVE A REPORT TO LEGISLATURE THAT IS IN THIS FINAL STAGE OF EDITING ON THE ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROGRAM. EXCUSE ME WE HAVE. ONE THAT WAS SUBMITTED TWO YEARS AGO. THERE'S A ROBUST BODY OF EVIDENCE ON EXPANDED LEARNING IN GENERAL AND THE OUTCOMES ON STUDENT ATTENDANCE INCREASE STUDENT ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL INCREASE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT- WE ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LEGISLATURE WAS THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT. THE QUESTION YOU JUST RAISED SO WHAT WE WILL BE EXPLORING AND COMING BACK TO YOU WE HAVE. A ROBUST BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT HIGH QUALITY EXPAND LEARNING PROGRAMS DO YOU PRODUCE STUDENT OUTCOMES ESPECIALLY FROM A WHOLE CHILD PERSPECTIVES FROM SOCIAL EMOTIONAL MENTAL WELLBEING MENTAL HEALTH. THESE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGER CONCERNS THAT SOMETIMES THE ACADEMIC INTERVENTIONS. I HAVEN'T AFFECTED SOMETIMES IT'S MORE OF A OF A NEUTRAL. THING BUT- THERE'S NO DENYING THAT. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING RIGHT NOW. WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES INCREASE SUICIDAL. TENDENCIES FOR EVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN THAT CONNECTING STUDENTS WITH A SAFE PLACE OCEAN WHEN PHYSICALLY AND WITH CARRIED ALL RELATIONSHIPS IS REALLY CRITICAL TO LEARNING BECAUSE OF THE STUDENT DOESN'T FEEL SAFE AND IN A PLACE THAT THEY'RE CARED FOR LEARNING IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN. SO BUT WE'RE IN A PROCESS OF HAVING MORE PRECISE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF TIME RIGHT NOW. WE'RE PRIMARILY. WORKING TO GET DISTRICTS IMPLEMENTING THIS FIGURING OUT WAYS TO GET IT DONE. AND OF COURSE THOSE OTHER QUESTIONS WILL COME FORTH. AND JUST OUT OF AS THE WELL YOU REMEMBER I BELIEVE IN HERE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING HERE IN THIS ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR ONE YEAR BUT JUST GONNA CURIOUS IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE OF TWENTY YEARS. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WOULD BE A GOOD ESTIMATE OF TIME PERIOD TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONE IMPLEMENTED AND NUMBER TWO ARE BEING EFFECTIVE IN THIS PURPOSE. WELL EVERYONE WANTS A QUICK RESULT LIKE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE FIRST YEAR WE'VE INVESTED IN A ONE POINT SEVEN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. WHAT ARE THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST YEAR. IN MY- IN MY EXPERIENCE- LOOKING OF PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS IS AT LEAST A PERIOD OF THREE OR THREE OR MORE YEARS BEFORE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME. SYSTEMC UNSETTLING THAT ESPECIALLY IN THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A RUN PROGRAMS BEFORE DEPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK THIS MORNING THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER MAN ANY QUESTIONS- THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY ENLIGHTENING- TESTIMONY WHICH IS. USUALLY THE CASE BUT I THINK THIS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY GOOD I HAD A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON SOME OF THE ALIGNMENT QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUES- AND I GUESS I JUST WANT TO START BY GETTING A SENSE OF HOW MANY SQUARE TO TAKE UP AS FAR AS ASUS AND- THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS- WE HAVE IN OUR NOTES. THAT ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA PART EDUCATION APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS PARTICIPATE IN THIS- WHAT PERCENTAGES OF WHAT PERCENTAGE IS THAT OF ALL SCHOOLS IN THE STATE LIKE I JUST DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY UP. TO TWELVE SCHOOLS WE HAVE SOME MAYBE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION YOU HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT. IT'S JUST OVER 40% SENATOR OKAY FORTY PERCENT. AND I GUESS AS A FOLLOW UP YOU KNOW I WAS INTEREST IN THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH I THINK YOU ECHOED- AND MISS MICHAEL- THAT. WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. YOU OP ES IS NOT ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT RATHER A- ANOTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING. ARE THERE. ARE THERE SCHOOLS OUT THERE OF THOSE SAY SIX THOUSAND PLUS THAT THE- DON'T HAVE CURRENTLY HAVE ACES ARE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. CLC THAT. YOU COULD IMAGINE HAVING E. LOP AS A STANDALONE OR IS THE IDEA HERE THAT YOU OP SHOULD JUST BE. TACKED ON TO SCHOOLS. THAT ALREADY HAVE CASES AND OR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS. SENATOR THE VISION OF THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM IS FOR. FOR EVERY ALLEVIATE TO HAVE THIS PROGRAM. AND ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT IS PRESENTED WITH WITH THAT WE HAVE A REALLY ADDRESSED YET. IS THAT THE E. L. O. P. I'M TRYING NOT TO USE THE WORD ACRONYM B. LOP AS CHAIR. BINANCE COSS KNOWS LEGISLATIVE STAFF THE L. APPEAR THE SPENDING UP THESE. ALSO REQUIRES THE PROGRAM BEING OFFERED TO. TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS YEAH WHICH HAS BEEN A SLOW UPTAKE ON ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY JUST BECAUSE OF STAFFING RATIOS AND STAFF QUALIFICATIONS. IT ALSO ENCOURAGES- NOT JUST THE BLENDING OF THE L. O. P. FUNDING WAS. THIS IS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUT ALSO WITH OTHER SUPPORT FOR EARLY LEARNING AND EDUCATION SO- THE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE BASES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY COULD HAVE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING. ARTIST PRINCES TO SUPPORT HE K. THAT COULD BE. BLENDED WITH THIS FUNDING TO CREATE ONE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM SO TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. WE WANT DISTRICTS TO THINK HOLISTICALLY WITH THIS FUNDING AND NOT THINK ABOUT HOW TO JUST ADD THE SONG AS AN APPENDAGE TO WHAT WE DO BUT TO THINK OF THIS NOW. AS NINE HOURS OF. STRUCTURED SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT INCLUDES INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES AND THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED DURING THE INSTRUCTIONAL DAY. BUT THAT. A DISTRICT YOU SHOULD THINK HOLISTICALLY ABOUT NINE HOURS OF CARE SUPPORT AND LEARNING CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING DURING THAT ENTIRE TIME SOURCE COMBINED WITH THE L. O. P. TO ACHIEVE THAT VISION. AND WHAT ARE SOME JUST FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION- I'M I'M BEEN A YEAR IN LIKE SENATOR AKOBO BUT- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING AND HOW DO THEY STACK UP COMPARED TO. ACES AND THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SHE'LL SEE. WELL CENTER YOU'VE JUST LEFT MY YOU'VE JUST LEFT MY WHEEL HOUSE MY COLLEAGUES I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF IT IS JUST LIKE. ARE THESE THE TWO BIG POTS OF MONEY OUT THERE ARE THERE OTHER BIG POTS OF MONEY AS WELL WHEN WE COME IN THERE'S FRIENDLY I MEAN THERE'S- ELEAZAR ARE NOW WORKING TO IMPLEMENT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND MY COLLEAGUES IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT. ARE EXPERTS ON EARLY EDUCATION. CAN OF WE CAN CERTAINLY GET MORE INFORMATION BACK TO YOU AND WILL- I CAN'T RATTLES OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD LIKE I CAN LEASES A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUT THOSE ARE THE FUNDING TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES I'M TALKING ABOUT THE- FUNDING SOURCES FOR EARLY EDUCATION- TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. KINDERGARTEN EXETER CAN BE WOVEN TOGETHER. GOT IT SO UP ALSO IN OUR NOTICES THAT THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE HAVE DUAL FUNDING FROM THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY C. CLC. PROGRAM AND ACES- SO THAT'S THAT IS SEVERAL HUNDRED SCHOOLS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT- MEANWHILE I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT FORTY TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS THAT I SAID PARTICIPATE IN A SEASON THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE. I GUESS I SEVEN HUNDRED THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. OUR PROGRAM. IT I GUESS MIGHT BE THE JUST I QUESTION IS IF THE GOAL HERE IS TO THINK OF YOU UP AS AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCE- WHY NOT JUST PUT IN THE ACES. AND DIRECTED TO THE PARTICULAR GOALS OF EXPANDING LEARNING AND LEARNING LOSS AS OPPOSED TO CREATING A STANDALONE PROGRAM WHICH YOU KNOW IF IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BUT BUT I GUESS- AND MAYBE THIS GOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT'S THE IMPETUS FOR. MAKING A BRAND NEW PROGRAM THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO HAVE ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO HAVE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS- YOU KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO YOU KNOW CREATE REDUNDANCY- EVEN IF YOU GUYS ARE TELLING US IS IT DOESN'T DO ANY OF THAT IS JUST THAT. ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCE CENTER AREA. BERMAN FINANCE WARNINGS- I'LL TAKE A STAB AT THAT. MANSER DOT QUESTIONS I THINK THERE'S- A FEW REASONS ONE IS THAT- BASIS PROGRAM SETTLERS RIGHT WITH PROP THREE NINE THREE YEARS AGO- THE SORCERER MINISTRATION AND IT HAS A LOT OF THOSE A LOT OF THE IMPLEMENTING. YOU KNOW DESIGN OF THAT PROGRAM YES CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AS A RESULT OF IT BEING A BALLOT INITIATIVE. AND SO THE ABILITY ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION OR EVENTHAT THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT ALTERNATELY. TO A MAN SOME OF THOSE PROVISIONS SOME OF THAT DESIGN- IS VERY LIMITED BECAUSE OF THAT. SO I THINK THAT'S ONE. I ANOTHER THING IS ALSO INHERENT WITHIN BACK PROVISION OR EXCUSE ME WITHIN THAT- THE PROPOSITION. MONTH THAT ESTABLISH A- ARE SO REQUIRED AROUND IF ADDITION FUNDING FROM. FOR A SAYS VAN UNDER THE- THE PROVISIONS OF THE ORIGINAL PROPOSITION THEN THERE IS A REQUIREMENT AS WELL TO INCREASE THE GUARANTEE. PURPOSES NINETY MINIMUM GUARANTEED BY THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING MR REDDY MISTRETTA **** JUST INTERRUPT FOR SECOND I THINK. MAYBE THERE WAS A DISCONNECT THERE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S THE MINIMUM IN THE THAT WAS CREATED BY THE BALLOT MEASURE BUT I THINK SENATOR MINUTES ASKING IF FROM GENERAL FUND RATHER SOURCES YOU COULD ADD TO IT YEAH WHAT I GUESS THE QUESTION REALLY IS WE'RE TALKING A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET OUTLAY HERE FOR THE EVIL THAT EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM A QUALITY LAW OFFICES FASTER BUT- WE COULD DIRECT THAT MONEY AND I DON'T. IT WHAT WITH WITH THEIR BE CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON US AS A LEGISLATURE DIRECTING THAT MONEY TO THE SAME PLACES THAT ALREADY RECEIVE ASUS FUNDING AND WITHOUT TAMPERING WITH THIRD IT YOU KNOW- INTERFERING WITH THE BALLOT MEASURE AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WOULDN'T THAT BE MORE EFFICIENT POTENTIALLY. AND GET RID OF SOME OF THE CONFUSION OR DONE AND SEE. THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU CREATE RENDON PROGRAM- CERTAINLY THINK IT'S- POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD PERHAPS BE SOMETHING. IMPLEMENTATION OF COULD HAVE BEEN SOME INTIMIDATION BENEFITS SO THAT APPROACH I DON'T KNOW A PERSON I DON'T KNOW THE ASUS PROGRAM MYSELF PERSONALLY. WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY SAY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER A 100% FOR CERTAIN- I WOULD MENTION AGAIN THE LIKE I WAS GETTING TO WITH. MY POINT ABOUT THE NINETY EIGHT THE BOSTON NINETY GUARANTEE CALCULATION IS THAT ANY FUNDING THAT WERE TO BE PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. ABOVE THAT- INITIAL AMOUNT DOES REQUIRE- PURSUANT TO THAT PROPOSITION AND INCREASE OR OR RE BENCH. OF THE PROJECT NINETY NANOMETER ANTIVIRAL I COME OUT AND SO IT DOES EXPOSE THE STATE- AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET RIGHT THE NONPARTISAN NINETY SEVEN. TO TWO- KIND OF A DECREASE IN AVAILABLE GENERAL FUND FOR THE NON NINETY SEVEN BUDGET BY A LIKE AMOUNT SO NICE. MISTER READY- LET ME TRY IT. AGAIN AND IT MAY BE A DIFFERENT WAY. IF WE WANTED TO ADD MONEY IS THERE A WAY TO DO IT THAT DOESN'T. CREATE ALL THOSE PROBLEMS. I AM NOT AWARE OF THE WAY. SENATOR CAN I TEACH ME ASSURE CAN I TAKE A- STAB OF COURSE YOU CAN. JONES SAWYER OF COURSE YOU CAN THERE'S ALREADY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND FINANCE ON. ON E. P. AN EAGLE UP LET'S SEE IF IT EXPANDS HERE. ACES THREE RED COAT IS A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM. THAT HAS. MANY DIFFERENT- PRESCRIBED ACTIVITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND FOR ELEAZAR TO APPLY FOR TO ACCOUNT FOR. AS I DESCRIBED IT SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATES A GRANT TO A SPECIFIC SCHOOL SITES. THE L. O. PROGRAM IS IN A SENSE THIS MONEY GOES OUT AS AN APPORTIONMENT. IT'S ACTUALLY LESS BURDENSOME. TO ADMINISTER M. FOR ELEAZAR ELLIE IS GOING TO REALLY FOCUS ON. WHAT KIND OF WORK PLAN ARE WE GOING TO PUT TOGETHER WHAT KIND OF DESIGNER WE CAN AND- CREATE AND HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT THIS. PERSON'S GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. OF WRITING AN APPLICATION. SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT WAITED MONTHS FOR PETITIONS SO I THINK. ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES IS THAT YELLOW PROGRAM FUNDING AS AN APPORTIONMENT. GIVES DISTRICTS MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDING DOES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THEIR DISTRICT. OKAY- HELLO WORLD MULLING THAT OVER YES SENATOR MEANT AS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT- YOU KNOW I'M I'M OUR JOB HERE IS OVERSIGHT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAMS- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS I ASSUME THERE ARE STRINGS ATTACHED IN THERE SOME KIND OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND WHATNOT- ARE THE STREAMLINED LIKE SO IF AS WE GO BACK TO THE SORT OF THE ORIGINAL. PROPOSITION HERE THAT DISTRIBUTION IS DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES AND AS WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO SEE A SCHOOL DO. ALL THREE OF ASUS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY COMMUNITIES LESS LEARNING CENTERS AND- EXPANDING LEARNING OPPORTUNITY. PROGRAMS AND RECEIVE ALL THREE SOURCES OF FUNDING. WOULD THAT CREATE. ADDITIONAL REPORTING IN OR OVERSIGHT AND OR- OTHER ACCOUNTABILITY. MEASURES FOR PARTICULAR SCHOOL OR ARE THEY BASICALLY HARMONIZED SO THAT. ARE THE ADDITION OF SET YOU OFF FUNDING DOESN'T CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THAT MAKES SENSE AND I COULD BE FOR A OR- FINANCE OR ANYONE ELSE. HELLO MISTER I CAN TAKE A LOOK QUICKSTEP OF THAT AND THEN MS- MAYBE MICHAEL FROM DEPARTMENT AT ONCE- TO TAKE A JUMP IN THERE AS WELL- HE'S WELCOME TO. OXFORD TO MY KNOWLEDGE- AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE EXPAND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM IS CONCERNED- THERE IS NOT A LOT OF- EXTENSIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AND NOT LANGUAGE AT LEAST NOT TO DATE- WHAT THERE IS IN THERE- AS WAS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE LENA GRANT IN HER PRESENTATION. IS THE PROPOSAL OF SOME ON IT PENALTIES THERE WERE OTHER PENALTIES IN THE INITIAL PROVISIONS PROPOSED LAST YEAR AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO HAVE SOME REVISIONS TO THOSE- SO THAT'S MORE PROPORTIONATE PENALTY NOT YOU KNOW WHAT OKAY. ALL OR NOTHING PENALTY- BUT THAT'S NOT SO MUCH A REPORTING REQUIREMENT IT'S KIND OF JUST BACK IN ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE ANNUAL AUDIT LIKE WE HAVE FOR A LOT OF PROGRAMS RIGHT- SO I COULDN'T AND I UNFORTUNATELY GOT I DON'T HAVE AS MUCHEXPERTISE WHEN IT COMES TO ASUS OR SOME OF THESE OTHER. SIMILAR PROGRAMS SO MADE APARTMENT THAT COULD SPEAK IN ON THAT REGARD IN TERMS OF REPORTING BURDENS ON AN ALLEY ANY- BUT CERTAINLY LIKE MICHAEL IT TO EARLIER WE HAVE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS IN IN THE- SEVERAL MONTHS FROM THE ENACTMENT IN JUNE. SALAS THE PROGRAM ABOUT WAYS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THINGS STILL CHEAT THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM- BUT PERHAPS STREAMLINE THINGS FOR AT LEAST THE EXTENT POSSIBLE AND CERTAINLY THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE STILL ONGOING AND I THINK THAT. WOULD DEFINITELY BE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS. NOT A THANK YOU CENTER. ONE MARK- SO I THINK YOU SAW OF STARTED ANSWERING THIS IN RESPONSE TO SOME OTHER. BUT I JUST WANTED TO LIKE GET A CLEAR ANSWER. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- EXPANDED THE EVA PROGRAM. THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT AFTER HEARING SOME OF YOUR ANSWERS IS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE. SOME CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO. IMPLEMENTING THIS. IN SCHOOLS THAT ALREADY HAVE ACES AND OR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- AND THEN YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING AND SCHOOL THAT. DOES NOT HAVE. ANY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN BOTH CASES A SCHOOL THAT HAS ACES OR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN A SCHOOL THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING. WHAT HE SEES THE CHALLENGES IN SCALING UP BECAUSE I THINK WE HEARD FROM ALEJO. THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I'VE HEARD THIS FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY- DISTRICT I REPRESENT. THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES THEY FACE AND IT IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PARTICULARLY AT THE PACE THAT'S ANTICIPATED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. SO WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE ACTUAL CHALLENGES IS THAT FACILITIES IS IT. STAFFING IS IT- PROGRAMMING SOMETHING ELSE AND. AND I THINK WE COULD START WITH THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION HERE. THE PROBLEM WITH CHALLENGE. IN EITHER CASE IN EITHER SCENARIO. IS WORKFORCE. AT THIS TIME THERE ARE. SOME WHO ARE TRYING TO THINK THROUGH THE CHALLENGES IN FACILITIES WITH OFFERING THE PROGRAM TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. AND I THINK SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ALSO FACING DISTRICTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE T. K. PROGRAM- WITH FOR EVERY DISTRICT ARE FOR TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES I CAN OFFER A DISTRICT THAT HAS DEVELOPED INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS- AND HAS OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES SO. I THINK THE WORK IS TO CREATE. A PEER NETWORKS WITH DISTRICTS TO CONNECT DISTRICTS WHO ARE. MAYBE HAVING DIFFICULTY THINKING THROUGH THE CHALLENGES WITH THE DISTRICT WHO HAS FOUND A WAY TO OPPORTUNITY. AND I THINK FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE PRIMARILY THINKING THIS IS WHAT OUR DISTRICT HAS TO IMPLEMENT WITH OUR OWN STAFF WE HAVE TO HIRE NEW STAFF OR IN OUR OWN FACILITIES. CONNECTING THEM WITH DISTRICTS WHO HAVE REALLY TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK. WHAT OTHER ASSETS ARE OUT THERE IN IN AND AROUND OUR COMMUNITY EVEN IN SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS TO FIND A WAY TO BUILD NEW PARTNERSHIPS NOW WE'RE STARTING TO GET TO THIS NOTION OF COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WHICH IS ALSO. IN THE BUDGET AND ANOTHER INITIATIVE. BUT FOR A SMALL COMMUNITY SCHOOLS DONE WELL ARE A WAY OF. THINKING OF PARTNERING AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS. THAT THINKS ABOUT. MAYBE SOME TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE AND ALWAYS CONSIDERED IN THE PAST. AND SO I THINK. THE QUICKEST AND BEST SOLUTION IS TO. YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING FOR ME TO SAY IN A MEETING OR WEBINAR CONSIDER THIS OR DO THAT BUT IF THE DISTRICT WHO'S HAVING DIFFICULTY IT'S A CHANCE TO TALK TO AMANDA AND HER PEERS A GILROY AND TALK THROUGH THE PEER TO PEER INTERACTION IS REALLY WORKING I'VE SEEN IT WORK. A LOT AS WE'VE PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE NETWORKING AND GET THESE DISTRICTS TO WORK OGETHER AND KNOW THAT THE ANSWERS THAT THEY NEED. ARE OFTEN. IN IN THE COMMUNITY NEXT DOOR. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE ANSWERS AND- I JUST WANT TO SAY THE CONCLUDED OF THIS A SEGMENT THAT I DO BELIEVE A PLOT THAT THE GOALS HERE OF ADDRESSING- LEARNING LAWSON OF THIS PROGRAM BUT- OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPORTANT MAKE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL RESPONSES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MEN. AND WE HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS IS THAT CORRECT YEAH. OKAY THEN- LET ME THANK EVERYONE WE DON'T USUALLY HAVE A CHANCE. FOR SUCH A THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS AND I REALLY APPRECIATED AND I THINK THAT- JUST TO REPEAT WHAT I'VE SAID IN THE TWO PREVIOUS HEARINGS- THE JANTAN BUDGET DOESN'T ALWAYS RESEMBLE CLOSELY THE BUDGET THAT IS ADOPTED. AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND THE REASON IT DOESN'T S. DISCUSSIONS LIKE WE JUST TAPPED. BECAUSE OUR- FINANCE AND TO SOME EXTENT THE OHIO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION NO LET JUST LET YOUR CALL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. OF THE COMMENTS WHEN WE DRILL DEEPLY INTO THIS AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME PLACES THAT WE CAN IMPROVE IT GOING FORWARD THIS CONVERSATION WAS REALLY HELPFUL TO THAT. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE FROM GILROY FOR PARTICIPATING. ALWAYS REALLY HELPFUL TO HEAR WHAT IT'S LIKE ON THE GROUND SO. PROJECT THAT DISCUSSION WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. WHICH IS A SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING PROPOSALS. AND I'M SORRY DIDN'T GO OVER THE NAMES BEFOREHAND AND I HOPE I DON'T SLAUGHTER SOMEBODY'S NAME HERE BUT WE HAVE WAS M<u>&lt;c.red&gt; FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF&lt;/c&gt;</u> FINANCE AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND HEATHER CALUMNIES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF. EDUCATION AND WILL BEGIN. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING I'M APOLOGIES HAVE OUT A LAST MINUTE CHANGE LIVES MAIS INTERNET JUST PROP SO I WILL BE- COVERING AND SHE WILL JOIN US IF SHE'S ABLE TO GET CONNECTED TO THE HEARING. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS MANY OF THE IN THE FIELD HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS ARE GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS FIRST. SOLIDIFICATION INVESTMENTS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET CONTINUE THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE INTEGRATED IN THE ALLEYS ARE APPROACHING PLANNING FOR THEIR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND GREATER ALIGNMENT WITH PLANNING FOR ALL STUDENTS. THIS YEAR'S PROPOSALS WERE DEVELOPED WITH BOTH IN ATTENTION TO THE CHALLENGES BUT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE FACING AS THEY CONTINUE TO NAVIGATE KOPET. AS WELL AS THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM SERVING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RESOURCES AND SUPPORTED PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTINUES TO BUILD UPON THESE INVESTMENTS BY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION BASED FUNDING. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION INCLUDED FOR GROWTH IN COLOR. IN ADDITION TO THE AUGMENTED BSED FUNDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO CALCULATE SPECIAL EDUCATION BASED FUNDING ALLOCATIONS AT THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY LEVEL RATHER THAN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREA OR SILVA LEVEL. THIS IS INTENDED TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AND IMPROVE EACH ELEAZAR ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR FUNDING ALLOCATIONS AND SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM ANY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ADDITIONALLY THIS BETTER TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL ADA FLUCTUATIONS THAT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES- ARE EXPERIENCING AS THEY CALCULATE THE BASE SPENDING. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO CONSOLIDATE TO SPECIAL EDUCATION EXTRAORDINARY HOSPITALS INTO A SINGLE POSSIBLE TO SIMPLIFY THE CURRENT AND FUNDING FORMULA. AGAIN THIS IS INTENDED TO BE A TECHNICAL TEAM- WITH NO PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES BEING PROPOSED ALONG WITH CONSOLIDATION. ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO ALLOCATE EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDING DIRECTLY TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES RATHER THAN TO SOUTHWEST. AND AS A REMINDER- SAID THIS EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDING WAS CLASSED AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY AND BUDGET ACT AND NOW IT IS USED TO BENEFIT ALL STUDENTS. IT STEPPING UP THIS FUNDS WOULD NOT PROHIBIT THE POOLING OF RESOURCES INTO REACH ALSO SERVICES IN SMALL LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ALREADY DO WORK CLOSELY WITH THEIR COUNTIES TOOK PAINS MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES. FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND THEY SHIPPED WOULD NOT ALTER THOSE PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS. ADDITIONALLY IN RESPONSE TO CONTINUE ALLS FOR THE FIELD FOR MORE COORDINATION BETWEEN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION PLANNING. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO DEVELOP A SPECIAL EDUCATION ADDENDUM TO THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. THAT WOULD SUPPORT INCLUSIVE PLANNING AND PROMOTE COHESION FINALLY LINKING SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION. EFFORT ADDITIONALLY THE GOVERNOR SNYDER EDUCATION RESOURCE LEAVE ON- I ET BEST PRACTICES BEGINNING IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AS WELL AS ESTABLISH AN EXPERT PANEL TO CONTINUE REFINING THE MODEL I ET TEMPLATE THAT WAS DEVELOPED AS PART OF A RECENT WORKGROUP CONVENED BY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES TO BUILD UON THE ALTERNATE PATHWAYS TO DIPLOMAS WORKGROUP EFFORTS BY EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE FORCE BURKE OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLETION OF THE STATE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. WHAT THAT'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BUT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE DO SEE THAT YOUR COLLEAGUE IS GOING TO SO SHE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AS WELL- MAKES MORE MOVED TO. AND WE'RE DOING QUESTIONS AFTER EVERY PANELIST PRESENTS WERE MOVING TO EMILY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING MR SHARE SENATORS ANYWAY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SINCE THERE ARE MULTIPLE PROPOSALS UNDER THE SPECIAL EDUCATION ITEM I WILL JUST WALK THROUGH THE ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION STARTING ON PAGE NINE OF YOUR AGENDA- FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS THE PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. AUGMENTATION WE THINK THIS IS A PRUDENT WAY TO IN TO SPEND INCREASE PROP NINETY EIGHT FINDING AND ADDRESS THE LOCAL COST PRESSURES RELATED TO SPECIAL EDUCATION. NEXT TURNING TO AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MODIFY THE BASE RATE FORMULA. SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CALCULATE ATTENDANCE AT THE ALLEY A LEVEL RATHER THAN A SCALPEL LEVEL JUST AS A REMINDER IT SOMEPLACE OR SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS. ARE REGIONAL CONSORTIA OF ALLEY AS THAT COORDINATES SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND FUNDING- LARGE DISTRICTS TYPICALLY ACT AS THEIR OWN SELF THAT. WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH PROVIDE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONING TO THE SURPRISE THAT HAVE BOTH A MIX OF GROWING AND DECLINING MEMBER ALLEY AS- I'M JUST TO WALK. THROUGH THIS IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL SO UNDER CURRENT LAW A MEMBER DISTRICT WITH GROWING ATTENDANCE COULD HAVE THEIR GAINS OFFSET. IF ANOTHER MEMBER DISTRICT HAS DECLINING ATTENDANCE IN CONTRAST THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALLOWS ANY ALLEGATION WITH ATTENDANCE GROWTH IS ACTUALLY BLOCK IN THAT- LIKE IN THAT ATTENDANCE GROWTH AT THE L. A. LEVEL. AND THAT GROWTH WOULD GENERATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING EVEN IF THE SAMPLE OVERALL IS DECLINING ENROLLMENT. AND WE DO KNOW THAT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BASED FUNDING WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ALLOCATED AT THE SAMPLE LEVEL. NEXT MOVING ONTO THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE I. T. TEMPLATE AN ALTERNATE PATHWAY TO DIPLOMA. WE FIND THAT THESE PROPOSALS LACKS SPECIFIC TIMELINES AND EXPECTATIONS. BRING SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOESN'T SPECIFY A DATE BY WHICH THE ALTERNATIVE COURSE WORK OR TNCS MUST BE FINALIZED- BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE BE INTERESTED IN FINDING THESE ACTIVITIES WE RECOMMEND IT SPECIFY CLEAR DEADLINES AS WELL AS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE MONITOR. THE OUTCOMES OF THESE ACTIVITIES THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER SETTING IT'S- DEADLINE WHY I KEEP TEMPLE IS A LEGISLATURE IS INTEREST IN. THESE CALLS. NEXT ARE MOVING ON TO PROPOSAL TALLY BIG BANK HEALTH. TO ALLEY RATHER THAN SELF. WE SUGGEST ALLEGE. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THIS PROPOSAL ESPECIALLY HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT REGIONALLY CORNY TO PROGRAMS AND SCHOOL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING IN THE RECENT YEARS. ALTHOUGH SOME SELLERS MAY ALLOCATE TO MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THEIR MEMBER ELLIE AS- THERE ARE SOME SELFIES ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH SMALLER LEDS THAT RETAIN THIS FINDING AT THE SOFTWARE LEVEL. AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THEIR ALLEY AS- IN THESE CASES THE MEMBER ELOISE ARE TYPICALLY TOO SMALL AND WHAT IT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING ON THEIR OWN. THE HIGHER MENTAL SENTIMENTAL STAFF. AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES ON OUR OWN. THIS WILL LOOK AT ALL IMPACT SCHOOL. COUNTY MENTAL PERMISSION- UNDER THIS PARTNERSHIPS EXCEL BUT COULD DIRECT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING TO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHICH THEN PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. DISPOSAL COULD POSE CHALLENGES FOR THESE PARTNERSHIPS BY MAKING THESE PROGRAMS. MORE ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME SINCE COUNTIES BUT THEN NEED TO ARRANGE SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH EACH ELLIJAY OR POTENTIALLY REDUCE TOTAL FINDING F. AND ALLOCATE DECIDES TO PULL FUNDING FROM THE PARTNERSHIP. IF THEY DON'T FOR INSTANCE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE PARTNERING WITH THE COUNTY. THE LEGISLATURE ME JUST WANT TO FURTHER EXPLORE WITH THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARCH INDETERMINATE WHETHER THESE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH. THE IMPACT THAT THESE COULD HAVE ON THE REGIONAL PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS. LASTLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ON THE PROPOSALS TO CONSOLIDATE THE STATE'S TO EXISTING STRINGER HOSPITALS INTO ONE. I'M DEVELOP A SPECIAL EDUCATION ADDENDUM TO THE ALL CAPS- AND- ESTABLISH AN IPV AT BEST PRACTICES WE SOURCE LEAD. I THINK ON THE LAST REPORT WILL WE WILL JUST NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ME WANT TO REQUIRE THE NEW RESOURCE LEAD TO BE INVOLVED IN A DOUBLE UP ABOUT. DEVELOPMENT OF THE C. WHITE IT TEMPLATE JUST TO ENSURE THAT STATEWIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- FROM THE AP IS. RESOURCE LEAD IS ALIGNED WITH THE FINAL EIGHT P. TEMPLATE- THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOLDING QUESTIONS TILL THE END. AND NOW WE'RE GOING. TO MOVE TO ARM. HEATHER ADD. TO OF A- AND IT'S THAT I'M BEING OVER FROM I'M CAN TO GIVE YOU. MUCH TO ME HOW PRONOUNCE YOUR LAST NAME. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS HEATHER CALORIES ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. FROM TODAY I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND INVESTMENT IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE CONTINUED INVESTMENTS WILL ALLOW FOR STRATEGIC AND SYSTEMIC SHIFTS THAT WILL BENEFIT STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. MUCH LIKE THIS YEAR'S FISCAL PROPOSALS THIS YEAR'S POLICY RELATED PROPOSALS ALSO ALLOW FOR INCREASED COLLABORATION AND TRANSPARENCY AT ALL LEVELS OF OUR SYSTEM. ESPECIALLY BETWEEN CD. AND ELLIJAY THE PROPOSAL'S TAKES STEPS TOWARDS ONE SYSTEM AND ENSURE THAT THE VOICES OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THE PARENTS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE CAPTURED DURING THE SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. WE'RE ESPECIALLY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT TRANSITIONS WHETHER IT BE THE ON RAMP TO SCHOOLING WHAT ARE PARTS HE TO BE TRANSITION WORK OR THE OFF RAMP WITH OUR ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY WORK. CENTER TO CRITICAL TIMES IN THE STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE TRANSITIONS ARE SMOOTH AND PREPARE STUDENTS FOR NOT ONLY A MEANINGFUL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO A MEANINGFUL LIFE THAT INCLUDES VOICE AND CHOICE. THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WILL ALLOW US TO DEEPEN OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS DIDI ASKING DEAL ARE COUNTY OFFICES EDUCATION SELFLESS AND ALSO IN THE EIGHTIES. I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE ADDRESSING. OUR SYSTEM CHANGE MEANS THAT COLLABORATION AT EVERY STAGE OF THE SYSTEM IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS ASSISTING IMPROVEMENT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE OTHER PROPOSALS. MOVING FORWARD AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE COMMENTS AND- I HAVE TO SAY THAT. I AM WAGING A ONE PERSON WORE ON ACRONYMS AND YOU MAY. EVENTUALLY GET FOUR OF THEM IN ONE SENTENCE THERE AND I THINK WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT IN ONLY A IS AND THERE WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION BUT- WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE SO THAT PEOPLE LISTENING THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR UNDERSTATEMENT. ARM ARE GOING TO JUST READ WITH TWO QUESTIONS BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE MY- COLLEAGUES A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS AS WELL. AND THE FIRST ONE MAYBE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A TO START. THE HOST SINCE THE PROPOSAL CAME OUT. I HEARD FROM THE LOCAL AGENCIES THE CELL POSE. AND SO I WONDERED IF YOU COULD JUST A LITTLE. MORE CLEARLY EXPLAIN UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WHAT THE NOTABLE DIFFERENCES MIGHT BE AND THE ROLE THEY PLAY COMPARED TO THEIR ROLE TODAY. AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY LIST MIGHT SO MAYBE THAT'S A DIRECT HER. YES HI- THIS MIGHT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO OUR PROPOSALS ARE NOT AND- CURRENTLY TRYING TO CHANGE ANY OF THE ROLES THAT SUBWAY. WELL THAT'S A FASCINATING RESPONSE- ONLY BECAUSE THEY ALL THINK THAT THERE'S A CHANGE IS IT BECAUSE OF CHANGE IN FUNDING BUT NOT ROLES THAT I NOT ASKED THE QUESTION CORRECTLY A WHY DO THEY THINK THERE'S A CHANGE IN WIDER DAY EXPRESSING. THEIR FREE FLOATING ANXIETY OVER THE CHANGE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN- THE BUDGET WAS FIRST RELEASED AROUND WHT I'M CALCULATING THE BASE FUNDING AT THE L. E. LEVEL ACTUALLY MEANT- YOU KNOW THAT- SOME- SOME SALT IS. THOUGHT THAT MEANT THAT WE WERE ALSO FLOWING FUNDING TO ELEAZAR THAT'S NOT THE CASE I KNOW THAT ANOTHER. ASPECT THAT HAS BEEN- LIKE SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD IS THE FLOWING OF THE EDUCATION RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDING TO- TO ELEAZAR SELF US AND STOP FUNDING IS NOT. RESTRICTED TO JUST SPECIAL EDUCATION AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS THAT THIS WOULD DISTRACT REGIONAL STRUCTURES BUT WE DO NOTE THAT THIS. PROPOSAL DOES NOT- PRECLUDE ANY POOLING OF RESOURCES OR- YOU KNOW BASICALLY KEEPING THE STATUS QUO OF HOW SERVICE DELIVERY IT IS BEING MAINTAINED WE JUST WANT TO ALIGN. THE FUNDING- STILL-HOW. A FUNDING FLOWS IN AND THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE LET ME ASK THE OTHER TWO PANELISTS OF EITHER OF THEM HAVE A COMMENT ON. NOBODY SAYING ANYTHING SO I'M GATHERING THERE'S NO COMMENT. OKAY THEN I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION. IN OUR I THINK MAYBE START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SAFETY OTHERS BECAUSE IN MY OWN OF LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT ARE COMPARED TO THE LARGE URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY'RE SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SO THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN. HOW CAN WE PROTECT THE SMALLER DISTRICTS FROM EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF FUNDING ON SPECIAL EDUCATION LITIGATION AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS WHICH THEN GET ALLOCATED TO THE DISTRICT FUNDS N. AND I KNOW THAT- THAT ONE ONE PARTICULAR DISTRICT I JUST HAD OUT SIZED COSTS FOR ONE CASE IN THEIR SMALLER DISTRICTS DIDN'T REALLY COMPETES AGAINST. CLASSROOM SERVICES AND OTHER THINGS WHEN THAT HAPPENED SO- AT A IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO TO PROTECT. DISTRICTS AND IN THOSE SITUATIONS AND ONE EIGHT S. FIRST WITH FINANCE AND SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO COMMENT. I LIST MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I CAN'T YOU KNOW CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT OCCURRED IN THE DISTRICT YOU'RE REFERENCING BUT I WILL OTE THAT THERE WASN'T INVESTMENT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. TO SUPPORT DISPUTE OF PREVENTION INVOLUNTARY- ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION- PRACTICES AND THIS IS BASICALLY AIMED AT PROMOTING COLLABORATION BETWEEN FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS TO PREVENT THE STATE FROM OCCURRING OR ESCALATING AND THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I THINK WHAT A WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. IF I CONNECT YOU WITH THAT DISTRICT AND YOU COULD TALK TO THEM AND THEN. I CAN TALK TO BOTH YOU AND THEM AFTERWARDS TO SEE IF THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE THINK WAS A SOLUTION. AND IN FACT WAS% A SOLUTION THEY DIDN'T REALIZE IT BORTON FACT WAS NOT A SOLUTION AND IT BRINGS US BACK TO THE QUESTION OF. HOW TO TRY TO HELP THEM SO I KNOW I AM A STAFF MEMBER VERY CAREFULLY TAKING NOTES RIGHT NOW AND I'M TRYING TO HOOK YOU IN THE DISTRICT UP TO PURSUE THAT. ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS FROM EITHER THE L. A. OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THAT. OF FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING AT HOME THEY BOTH SHOOK THEIR HEADS- SO LET'S MOVE TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- SENATOR OR TROUBLED DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NONE AND SENATOR MINUTES TEMPORARY LEFT ROOM LET'S HOPE THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- SO. THEN ONE MAY ASK ONE MORE AND MAYBE HE'LL HAVE ONE WHEN HE COMES BACK AND A. N. THAT IS ONE THAT'S CALLED OUT IN THE AGENDA THAT- FOR STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WHO FAMILIES OF ELECTED TO KEEP THEM HOME DURING THE PANDEMIC. OR HAD TO QUARANTINE DUE TO CODE NINETEEN EXPOSURE OR INFECTION. WHAT TYPES OF SUPPORTS ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP ADDRESS THE LEARNING LOSS. IF ANY OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROPOSED WOULD BE TARGETED TOWARD THOSE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS AND LET'S START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AYE I'LL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TEAM THE FUNDING ASPECT OF THAT THERE IS- NOTHING SPECIFIC TO THAT- AND SPECIFIC TO SPECIAL EDUCATION CURRENTLY PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET BUT I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED. FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ONE TIME TO PROVIDE LEARNING RECOVERY SUPPORT FOR PEOPLES WITH DISABILITIES AND RELATED TO THE COULD BE NINETEEN DESTRUCTIONS AND THE FUNDS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE- AND I EXPECT. SANTIAGO HEATHER CALUMNIES AT THE DEPARTMENT TO MAYBE ANSWER. AS AND AS WAS MENTIONED AS WELL THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLOCATION FOR UPLOADING LOST- IS. ONE THAT CURRENTLY- IS YOU KNOW AGAIN ALLEYWAYS ARE- YOU KNOW. THE FUNDS MUST BE ENCUMBERED TWENTY TWENTY THREE- AT THIS POINT IN TIME- EACH FAMILY AID MUST HAVE YOU KNOW OUR STUDENTS A LEARNING RECOVERY PLAN- BUT TO CD AND SO SUPPORTING AND ALSO- INSURING- THE ALLEY IS HAVE THE RIGHT REQUISITE SUPPORT- THAT THEY NEED FROM C. OR OTHER- ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE AS OUR SOFTWARE PROVEN LEADER STATEWIDE SYSTEM SUPPORT AS WELL- AND SO WHAT WE TREND IN TERMS OF THOSE. THE ONES ARE BEING USED- I'M- SO. IN OF THE- AND SUPPLIES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ON THE HIRING STAFF TO WELL- AND SO- YOU KNOW IF YOU WE ARE. VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR- WITH OUR ALLEYS ACROSS A THIS ACROSS THE EXPENSE GOALS. I DIDN'T WANT MENTION IS WELL TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT ALSO. ASSEMBLY DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING- TO PROVIDE. ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO LOCAL EDUCATION EDUCATION AGENCIES IN DEVELOPING AND ADMINISTERING COMPREHENSIVE. PEACE IN TO DEVELOP TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO ASSESS AND ADDRESS LEARNING AND SERVICE NEEDS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES- FROM COMPLICATIONS OR DIFFICULTIES STEMMING FROM CORPORATE NINETEEN DURING- THAT THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SCHOOL YEAR AS WELL- AND SO- CVD ISSUED GUIDANCE ON THE WE ALSO. HAVE UP FOR. SOME OF THE CROSSES TO ALL TO ALL HELP. A SUPPORT TO SWAP. THANK YOU- DOES L. A. AND IN THE TIME THE MISTER J. OKAY THANK. ARE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS WE ON OF. DID THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH WE WENT THROUGH THAT TO BE MISTAKEN FOR HOW SERIOUSLY WE TAKE IT A. N. HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO LOOK AT THESE PROPOSALS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FLUSHED OUT AND AT WORK AND ARE THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE MAY REVISE AND MAY WE- KNOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE LIVING UP TO THE TO WHAT THEY'RE REPRESENTED A TO BE BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THE PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE THIS IS- AN ITEM OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE THIRD AND LAST ITEM. OUR ON OUR AGENDA TODAY WHICH IS FUNDING FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND ACCESS PROPERTY TAX. INTO THIS IS A WHO LAID OUT IN THE AGENDA IT IS ABOUT A- HISTORIC YOU SHOOT THIS IS JUST INFORMATIONAL. AND THE TWO MEMBERS OF THE PANEL OR EDGAR CABRAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND EARNED A READY OF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WARM WE'LL BEGIN WITH MR CABRAL. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE GROUP BOTH A ANALYST'S OFFICE. I HAVE A GOOD SUMMARY THE ISSUE IS- HOEKSTRA. A BRIEFING. OF WHAT THE ISSUE IS A TRADING POINT IN OF HELP YOU START WITH MEANS SO I THANK YOU FOR PAYING ATTENTION WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL. DEMOCRATS ARE PRETENDING IT PUBLIC ALSO THE FOR WHAT ACTORS. TALK ME. A TRIPLE PLAY. TO OFFICE PROJECT AND SCHOOLS. THE J. BOTH- COMING OF WITH THE KIDS AND SCHOOL. ARE THERE. FUNDING FORMULA THE LOWER CONTROL FORMULA. THE FORMULA OF THE LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR COUNTY OFFICE BUT IT YOU HAVE THIS IN GENERAL IDEA YOUR DESPITE FUNDING. AND THEN WITH THE STATE DOES THE IT LOOKS HOW MUCH LOCAL TAX. THE ENTITY RECEIVING AND THE- DIFFICULT TO PROTECT TAXES ARE BASED ON SORT OF FREE PROPERTY. OF FUNDING AND WHATEVER AMOUNT IS- EVAN REMAINING TO THE DISTRICT NEEDS OR TRAVIS. YEAH FOR FORMULA OF THE- ARE REQUIRED TO RECEIVE AND THAT'S BOTH PROPERTY TAXES ARE WHAT WE CALL ACCESS PROPERTY TAXES THERE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT'S- NECESSARY TO PROVIDE YOUR FEEDBACK. THE PRODUCT FOR SCHOOL THIS BETTER PROPER TAX THEY LADY ARE. GET TO KEEP A USE LOCAL YOU WHATEVER PRAYER THEY HAVE- COUNTY OFFICES MEETING. NOT BE NOT AUTHORIZE TO SPEND A FROM TAXES. ON THE FUNDING FOR- A LONG TIME WAS A TYPICALLY IN CA OF WHAT OVER. I DON'T THIRD WAS BIG USED TO COVER UP THE FOR WHATEVER COULD FUNDING THE ONE- INFO WHEN YOU'RE- I WOULD BE IN THE TWENTY TWO THERE WAS A WAY TIME TAX. IN TWENTY ELEVEN AND IN TWENTY FORTY A PIC OF MORE PERMIT ON. A CHANGE WAS TO TAKE THE ACCESS PROPERTY TAXES FROM COUNTY OPPOSITE. IN YOUR DOES ARE DIRECTLY GO TO THE WITH THE TO. THE SUPERIOR COURT OF BETTER IN. EACH COUNTY IN THE COUNTY THAT HAVE. TO- THAT WAS A BIG THAT WAS A GOOD NET EFFECT THAT IS BY STATE GENERAL FUND SOME OF THIS. CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND THAT FOR THE TRUCK WITH SYSTEM. BECAUSE IT IT HAPPENED THAT YOU HAVE LESS GENERAL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED. NUMBER HAS INCREASED OVER TIME AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE. BUT AGAIN THAT THE NET EFFECT OF THE OF THE POLICY- THE RECENT POLICY CHANGE RIGHT NOW I'M NOT A RESERVE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS BUT THAT THAT CHANGE. RESULTED IN THE STATE BEING ABLE TO CAPTURE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH- WITH PROTECTIVE TAXES- IT DIDN'T NEED ANY CHANGES FOR WHAT. COUNTY OFFICES CAN DO KIND OF REMEMBER ALLOWED TO STEP BACK EXISTS ON IN THE ACTIVITY. ON TOP OF THE WATER IN APPEARANCE OF THE- AND LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MISTER READY. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. ONE RESEARCHER AGAIN IN A OR IF- I DO. HAVE ANYTHING DOWN TO- AND YOUR COMMENTS I DON'T REALLY DO. IF EITHER I THINK YOU SOME UP- THE ISSUE. QUITE SINGLING AND I AGREE THAT THE GEN. ITEM ALSO UNDER DETAILED AND OUT I DON'T. HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH ITS- BUT HAPPY. ANSWER QUESTIONS. ARE WE HOPE THAT- DEAL CALM. SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE. WITH THE AGENDA SECTOR ON A ITEM SO WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT ONE- THEN. IF YOU LIKE TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS AND ACTUALLY. IN A WAY THAT I THINK YOU ACTUALLY. OUR OF MOSTLY ANSWERED SOME OF THEM BUT JUST A DIRT CLEARLY MAYBE I'LL START WITH MR CABRAL AND JUST EVER SEE IF MR READY IT HAS THINGS THAT HE WISHES TO ADD BUT- YOU MENTIONED THAT- IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS THE TOTAL OF THE- OF THE ACCESS AND THAT. FIFTY FIVE ACROSS SO ALIVE IN FACT COUNTIES AND THAT'S UP SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT THAT WAS DONE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN OR TWENTY FOURTEEN WHATEVER THAT WAS SET CORRECT. CORRECT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE AMOUNT WAS- ORIGINALLY I THINK THE BUT I BELIEVE- IT WAS IT WAS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF THINK IT WAS MORE IT IS CLOSER TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- AND THEN SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE PROPERTY TAX BY USERS USE. OF YOU KNOW AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO THE TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION I BELIEVE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET IDEA THE FINDINGS OF THE MISSING THING LIKE A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION FOR THE BUDGET. AND THEN- YOU MENTIONED ALIVE AND COUNTIES AND AT THAT NUMBER HAD GROWN- SO ORIGINALLY IT WAS A SMALLER NUMBER OF COUNTIES LIKE FOR FIVE MINUTES MOVED TO ELEVEN ROUGHLY. YEAH THANKS FOR THE CHARACTER OF THE EXACT NUMBER OF COUNTIES INITIALLY WHEN THIS WHEN THIS WAS AN ACTIVE BUT IF IT BECAUSE THAT WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASED NUMBER OF COUNTIES WITH KNOWLEDGE AND THEN- IS THERE A WAY TO CHARACTERIZE THE ELEVEN COUNTIES AND WHAT I MEAN IS. IS IF IT'S ELEVEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE ACCESS PROPERTY TAX MONEY DO THESE TEND TO BE COUNTIES THAT HAVE HIGH AMOUNTS. OF- PROCESSED PROPERTY VALUE AND THE REASON. A MEAN THIS IS. WE WERE NEXT TO FIND A WHOLE HOST OF ZERO NEVADA COUNTIES AND WE BE MORE FOR SO WORKS CLARA I KNOW ONE AND OTHER PRICE VALUE COUNTY IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT DO YOU THINK- GENERALLY FOR IT WITH ALL PROPERTY TAX RELATED THINGS BUT YOU ALWAYS COME UP WITH QUIRKS. YOU KNOW PART OF THE BE FUN HOW MY- WHAT'S OF PROPERTY TAXES WERE PROVIDED TO EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN PROPERTY WITHIN ACTED IN BOTH THOSE SHARES HAVE BEEN FROZEN IN TIME SO. I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME HIGHER PROPERTY VALUE COMPANIES THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO BE ON THIS LIST BUT MAYBE ARE NOT BECAUSE OF THOSE. FOR THOSE REASONS BUT IN GENERAL- IT YOURSELF THAT'S CORRECT- THE COUNTIES WHO TEND TO BE ON THIS LIST I BELIEVE ROUGHLY HALF OF THE IN TERMS OF THE DOLLAR VALUE OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT. EXTRA FRIENDLY ROUGHLY HALF IT COMES FROM SAN MATTEO IN SANTA CLARA. AND SOLD SUBJECT IT IT IT DOESN'T TO BE RELEASED TO COUNTY SAN HAVE. IT TURNS OUT HIRED A COUPLE ROLE SYSTEM THANK YOU. VERY MUCH THAT AND THEN ALSO. THE ASSEMBLY COUNTIES THE MALLOY THAT THEY HAVE JUST RETURNED TO ADD. RATHER THAN OTHER CALL. REFER TO IT AS IT THAT WAS DONE AT THE HIGH OF THE- MELT- AND LYFT IN PLACE THE I DON'T WANT YOU TO. HAVE TO ON THE CASE A OF BY IT WAS A- DONE A TIME THE BUDGET WAS STRUCK IN TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEFICIT DID WORKING FOR EVERY. OF PLACE TO TRY TO DRAW. FROM IS THAT PROBABLY AN ACCURATE STATEMENT. I THINK THAT'S HER MOTHER INITIAL THE FIRST YEAR THAT IT WAS DONE TO THE PEOPLE THAT INTO ELEVEN WHEN THE STATE WAS IN IN A PRETTY ARE THE PASSAGE OF PROP THIRTY AS REVENUES TO COME TICKET SOMETHING THAT BOB OF OUR- JUST TO- THINK. I THINK I'M- BUT WE GOT TO THIRTEEN FORTY MINUTES WAS IN A ON A PER BASIS I DON'T KNOW I WOULD CHARACTERIZED FACT THAT WAS THE- ANYMORE- I WOULD SAY ALSO. PART OF WHY IT. PROVIDED YOUR- A COMMUNITY AN OPTION BUT THE THING THAT HAS. LOOKED BACK COUNTY. PROPERTY TAX THE GIVEN AND OTHER. SUPPORT THESE FIND ARE A PEOPLE. IS STRICTLY WITH THE- THERE IS SOME SPECIALIST. FROM THAT IS COMES FROM PROPERTY TO VALUE. BETTER FROM YOU STILL- THE PRACTICE OF FINDING IDENTIFIED OTHER WAYS TO. THAT FUNDING BE I- DURING THAT. PIECES B. R. THE TIME. OF FOR MOST OF. I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING OF THE STATE HAS. IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS. AND I THINK THIS QUESTION BUT LET ME JUST REEMPHASIZE IT. ARM IF FOR ANY REASON MONEY WORK TO BE ABLE FROM THE ACCESS TAXES GO TO THE- EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A LIKE AMOUNT OF MONEY APPROPRIATED FOR THE EXPENDITURES THAT WERE DISPLACED BY THAT HAPPENING WOULD THAT BE CORRECT. RIGHT NOW THIS THIS PROVIDES FUND FEEDING FOR THE STATE TO COME THE STATE COURT COSTS SO IF THE IF FUNDING WERE NO TO BE YOU IN THIS WAY THE STATE WOULD TO BACK OUT UNDER AND FIFTY OR NOT HUNDRED GROW TURN TABLE. WITH GENERAL. TO COVER THOSE COSTS AND YOU INDICATE THE BECAUSE THERE'D BEEN QUESTION ABOUT SOME OF THE COUNTY. PEOPLE THAT THIS MONEY ACTUALLY DOES NOT. OUT OF THE COUNTY THAT IF IT WAS COLLECTED AS PROPERTY TAX WITHIN A COUNTY GOES TO COURT RATHER EXPENSES THAT ARE WITHIN THAT COUNTY IT. DOESN'T MOVE AROUND SAID CORRECT THE COMING. I BELIEVE THAT. THE POLITICS OF THE CALL BEFORE. RATHER ARE GOING TO FONG- THE FUNDING IS TRYING TO THERE THEN THEN THE TO BELIEVE IF YOU GO. BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE TO THE COURTS TO FOR TWENTY. FROM THE TH STATE'S PERSPECTIVE IT NOT COMING TO THIS AND STATE DIVISION PROFESSOR WAY. I'VE BEEN REMAINS ALL OF LOCAL. BACK WAS CREATED SEVERAL YEARS AGO FOR A VARIETY OF OTHER OF ACTIVE LIKE THIS. WERE FUNDS WOULD BE USED LOOK. AMERICA STABLE MEANS THAT THE- MY THAT. YOU TO BE SPENT ON THE TRUCK WERE WITH THEM AS- THE- WILL. THEIR RECORDS. IN THE COUNTIES RECEIVE LESS GENERAL. BECAUSE THE RECEIVING TAX DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT. FOR THE COURTS OF THE MISSING NET HE IN THE AMOUNT OF ALSO TO. HAS MOVED AMONG CAN PER PROP TAXES JOHN AND THEN NEXT QUESTION MAY BE UNDER. PLONGEON THE WE BUT OF. THE IT TERMS OF WHAT I MEANI GUESS I CAN SEE IF. THE FUNDING. I THINK THE WAY WE NEED TO DO IT THERE WHEN HE WAS SORT OF STAYED IN THE CAMP OF THE COPIER. WE COUNTY ALSO THE- SO ASSEMBLY. HAVE WOULD BE ABLE RECORD INTEREST DON'T. I DON'T THINK OF THE BIG. INTEREST ON THEIR NEVER A- THAT. FOR MY ANDERSON. NOT AND- SOMETHING THOSE SPECIFICALLY CONCERT WHEN Y. OF. THE FUNDING WOULD MOVE. OUT TO OUR- TO THE- FOR GENERAL TAKES FOR COURTS. I WITH. I DO IS JUST SORT OF A FACT. MATTER WHETHER THAT. TRUE AND I'D- THAT SOME OF THE COW IN QUESTION IF THEY WOULD. INDICATE WHAT THEY SPEND THE MONEY IF- IF- IT IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT THEY WERE UP FOR COMPETITION WITH THE- WITH THE OTHER FUNDS AND SO I THINK D. A. OBVIOUSLY IN THE TWO COUNTIES THAT YOU MENTIONED. OF THE THEY FEEL. STRONGLY THAT THIS MONEY IS BEING DIVERTED AWAY FROM LOCAL EDUCATION USES IN IT TO END AND HAVE STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT IT. AND SO I THINK THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN REALLY HEALTHY BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE IS GROWN TALKS ABOUT THE COUNTIES. IT DRESSES THE ISSUE THAT'S THEIR CONCERN OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS A GIMMICK OR WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE REPLACED OVER TIME- IT IT. MAKES CLEAR THAT OTHER THINGS WOULD HAVE TO BE FUNDED BURKE FOR THE DISPLACED COSTS. ARE IT'S CLEAR THAT THE MONEY GOES TO THE COUNTIES NOW- AND IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT AT LEAST THOSE TWO COUNTIES PROBABLY. OR MORE WELL TO DO THAT SOME OTHER COUNTIES THAT IS IT THIS MIGHT BE HAPPENING TO OR NOT. AND THE ISSUE OF INTEREST SEEMS OPEN. AND THEN. IT HE I HAD ASKED THEM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT SPEND THE MONEY ON IF IN FACT. IT WERE NOT DIVERTED BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE POLICY FINDING THAT THAT IS COMPETITIVE WITH THE OTHER EXPENDITURES AND SO. THERE'S JUST STRONG CONCERN ABOUT THIS AND SOME OF THE COUNTIES WHERE THIS IS GOING ON AND- AND THE IRONY IS THAT. IF IN FACT. THIS IS WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE STATE TO DO AND THEN THE STATE IS WEIGHING THINGS OF IMPORTANCE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WHETHER IT'S COURTS AND ACCESS. MIGHT IRONICALLY MAKE A CASE FOR MOVING SOME OF IT OUT OF THE COUNTY OF ORIGIN AND EQUALIZING GET THROUGH THE DIFFERENT EDUCATION. OUR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE IN A WAY THAT THAT IF THE STATE IS PRIORITIZING IT THAT HAPPENS BUT- I THINK THEY'LL BE CONTINUED TALK ABOUT THIS AND THEIR STRONG CONCERN IN SOME COUNTIES. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST IMPORTANT FOR US TO AGENDA I SAID HAVE A DISCUSSION AIRED IN THE LIGHT OF DAY AND BE AWARE OF. OF THE CONCERNS THAT EXIST FROM THOSE ELEVEN COUNTIES SO. I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM EITHER OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS- CENTER ROADSHOW BOAT THANK YOU- IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION DO WE HAVE ANY OF THESE COUNTIES- WE GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT OR FEEDBACK. OR DID YOU HAVE A PERSONAL CONVERSATION WITH THEM ARE BELIEVE ME THEY HAVE HAD PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH ME OKAY. THEY WERE AND THEN THE ENGINE AND I KNOW THAT. I'M BY NO THAT- I BELIEVE IT'S THE CAPITAL VISORS FIRMS WORKING ON. THIS HAS HAD A MEETING WITH FINANCE AND OTHER PEOPLE TO RAISE THESE ISSUES OKAY BUT LAST YEAR IT CAME UP AT THE END OF OUR BUDGET PROCESS. WITHOUT THERE HAVING BEEN ANY DISCUSSION ALONG THE WAY AND SO THIS YEAR I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT. TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION SO IF THIS CONTINUES AS THE DISCUSSION IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WE ARE FULLY AIRED THE ISSUES IN A WAY. THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEM AND I THINK IT'S VERY HARD. FOUR OF THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY REALLY VIEW IT AS SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY WOULD COME THEIR WAY. AND YET ARE. IN ONE COUNTY THAT'S AFFECTED. LAST YEAR. WHEN IT WAS RAISED AT THE END OF THE BUDGET SESSION I HEARD FROM COUNTY GOVERNMENT WHO'S INCREDIBLY CONCERNED IT WOULD BE A CUT TO THEIR COURT SYSTEM. THE END SO ALL THOSE DYNAMICS AROUND THEIR- AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY BE AWARE OF THE MEN IF THERE IS A HARD TO BE ANY CHANGE OVER TIME OF ANY KIND WE WOULD'VE HEARD IT VERY CLEARLY AND WE WOULD HAVE WEIGHED THE PROS AND CONS HOW IT WORKS. AND WHAT THE TRADE OFFS ARE THAT'S WHAT WE JUST DID. BRIGITTE THAT NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ASKING. ARE THERE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ON THE SIDE OF. THEN WE APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING HERE.
