THE BEHAVIOR OF NOT ONLY

THIS S THE OUT WASTEFUL IT'S

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:51.106
UNNECESSARY WE USE OVER FIVE

IN THE OCEAN OR IN LANDFILL

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:58.881
POLLUTING THE WATER AND KILLING

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:00.215
MARINE LIFE WHEN THEY ARE IN THE

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.084
OCEAN. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.620
SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF SEA BIRDS

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:06.155
AND THIRTY PERCENT OF TURTLES

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:07.723
HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH PLASTICS IN

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.258
THEIR STOMACHS. THINK ABOUT

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:11.226
THOSE STATISTICS

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:12.895
WHEN THEY INGEST PLASTIC MARINE

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.432
MORTALITY RATE.

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.100
CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.536
PLASTIC STRAWS ARE NOT ROUTINELY

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:22.438
RECYCLED AS MUCH YOUR THEIR

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.372
THEIR TO LIGHT WEIGHT TO MAKE IT

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:25.574
THROUGH TO ME CANTICLE RECYCLING

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.209
SHORTER. DROP THROUGH THE

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.677
SORTING SCREENS AND MIX WITH

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.012
OTHER MATERIALS THAT ARE TOO

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:31.947
SMALL TO SEPARATE AND SO THEY

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.282
END UP CONTAMINATING RECYCLING

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:35.150
LOADS OR GETTING DISPOSED OF AS

01:12:35.217 --> 01:12:36.318
GARBAGE.

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.087
IF WE DON'T ACT NOW BY THE YEAR

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.455
TWENTY FIFTY.

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:42.291
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN AND PREDICTED.

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:43.826
THAT THERE WILL BE MORE PLASTIC

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:45.761
IN THE OCEAN THEN FINISH.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.196
THIS BILL ALONG WITH OTHER

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:48.764
PLASTIC MARINE DEBRIS BILLS WE

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:50.733
HAVE BEFORE US ARE HELPING US TO

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.568
CURB. OUR ADDICTION TO SINGLE

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.369
USE PLASTICS.

01:12:54.436 --> 01:12:56.538
AND HELP US MOVE TOWARD USING

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.941
THINGS THAT ARE MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.342
AND LESS DAMAGING I ASK THAT YOU

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:02.578
SUPPORT THIS BILL.

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:03.679
THINGS BLOOM SHARPER HERE

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:07.149
RECOMMENDS.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.217
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:10.119
SPEAKER MEMBERS LITTERING IS A

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:12.154
HUGE PROBLEM IN THIS STATE. BUT

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:12.955
RATHER THAN GO AFTER THE

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.656
OFFENDERS A. B. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.291
FOUR PLACES THE BLAME ON

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.360
RESTAURANTS.

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:19.561
THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:22.264
CALIFORNIA IS MAKING IT HARDER.

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:24.399
FOR BUSINESSES TO OPERATE HERE

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.068
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:27.569
MOST OF THESE RESTAURANTS SERVE

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:30.472
BEER WINE COFFEE WHICH DO NOT

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.674
REQUIRE A STRAW TO DRINK.

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:33.709
THE REAL PROBLEM IS WHEN

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:35.611
CUSTOMERS GET FAST FOOD AND DUMP

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.613
THEIR TRASH.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.581
ON THE GROUND AT A PARK. AND THE

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:42.317
BEACH OR LONG A HIKING TRAIL.

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:44.052
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL PROVIDES

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:46.088
AN EXEMPTION FOR THOSE TYPES OF

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:48.056
RESTAURANTS AND DOES NOT PUNISH

01:13:48.123 --> 01:13:49.792
THE OFFENDERS.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.894
IF WE REALLY WANT TO CLEAN UP

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.695
OUR OCEANS IN OUTDOOR AREAS THEN

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:54.863
WE NEED TO CRIMINALIZE THE

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.265
PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.033
TRASHING OUR STATE. THE

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.335
LITERATURES AND NOT.

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:03.238
THE INNOCENT RESTAURANT OWNERS.

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:05.040
I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.209
INDEED A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.210
THE WAY THIS BILL WAS ORIGINALLY

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.711
WRITTEN.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.747
WAS RIDICULOUS AND I THINK THIS

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:12.781
IS JUST AN INCREMENTAL A STEP

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.883
TOWARDS THAT.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.218
THIS REMINDS ME OF WHAT I WAS ON

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:16.752
THE HUNTINGTON BEACH CITY

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:18.420
COUNCIL.

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:19.688
AND IF IT WASN'T ONE THING IT

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:21.256
WAS ANOTHER WAS THE BAND OF THE

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.825
MONTH CLUB AND THEY ALWAYS ADD

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:24.827
SOME BECAUSE SOMETHING TO BAN

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.628
EVERY SINGLE YEAR THEY WOULD

HERE IS THE ISSUE WITH THIS

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:30.272
BILL.

01:18:30.338 --> 01:18:33.575
THIS VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:35.811
HAS BEEN DWINDLING VERY QUICKLY

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:37.412
OVER THE YEARS THAT IS DOWN NOW

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:38.747

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.415
THE PAST.

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:43.485
TEN TWENTY YEARS IT'S DOWN TO.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.020
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:47.389
IT'S HARDLY ANYTHING.

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:48.924
THIS MONEY GOES FOR VICTIMS SO

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.459
THAT THEY CAN GET TO MENTAL

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:51.893
HEALTH SERVICES.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.328
IN SOME CASES THEY CAN GET

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:55.297
ALARM SYSTEM PUT IN THEIR HOMES

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:56.398
BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL OF THEIR

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:57.399
SAFETY IN THE LIVES OF THEIR

01:18:57.466 --> 01:19:03.305
CHILDREN.

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:05.540
IT ALLOWS THEM TO GO SEEK THE

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:06.775
HELP THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:09.244
SOMETIMES VERY SEVERE CASES.

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:10.579
SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:12.948
FUND THAT HAS. MINIMAL RESOURCES

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:14.583
RIGHT NOW IN IS WINDING DOWN

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:16.284
VERY QUICKLY AND THERE'S NO

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:18.186
AVENUE HERE TO REPLACE THAT

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:20.222
FUNDING.

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:23.024
FOR ME I CAN'T JUSTIFY VOTING

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:25.293

I CAN'T VOTE TO.

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:34.169

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:35.770
ONE WOMAN'S PAT AND THE

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:37.405
TELENOVELA WOMEN THAT THERE

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:39.341
ISN'T ENOUGH FUNDING FOR HER TO

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:41.843
GET THE SERVICES THAT SHE NEEDS.

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:43.445
THAT JUST THAT DOESN'T SEEM

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.180
RIGHT TO ME SO ICE THAT I GET

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:47.449
THE IDEA BUT NONE OF US SHOULD

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:48.383
EVER TELL.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:51.786
I DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR OR

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:54.756

SEEKING THESE FUNDS.

01:19:58.226 --> 01:20:00.896
THAT THEY'RE IN SECOND PLACE

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:01.897
BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPETING FOR

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:03.932
THAT BINDING. WITH SOMEONE

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:06.301

AS WE PASS THIS APPROPRIATIONS

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:22.017
BECAUSE. I THINK MY COLLEAGUE

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:23.218
FROM LIKE ALL SORTS RIGHT THE

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:24.920
FUND IS DEPLETING AND IT'S VERY

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.721
HARD TO TO PASS THESE BILLS AND

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:27.722
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HAD BILLS

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:28.857
THAT WERE HELD BECAUSE THIS FUND

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.292
IS DEPLETING. BUT THE

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:31.626
RESEARCHERS SO CLEAR THAT IN

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.528
PARTICULAR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:33.962
VICTIMS.

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:35.931
THEIR PETS ARE USED AGAINST

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:39.067
THEM IN A WAY THAT AND. THAT THE

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:39.968
REST OF US CAN'T QUITE

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.236
UNDERSTAND IT IT'S A POWER

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:42.871
STRUGGLE AND THERE IS EVIDENCE

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.706
TO SUGGEST THIS IS RELATIVELY

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:47.142
INEXPENSIVE WAY OF MAKING

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.977
VICTIMS HOLE. AND SO WE THOUGHT

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:50.278
IT WAS A WORTHWHILE BILL TO PASS

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:51.780
OUT AND WE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:54.015
ONE ON ONE A VERY VERY NARROW

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:57.118
ONES THAT WE WE SHOULD CONTINUE

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:57.719

FOR CONSERVATORSHIP.

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:27.941
BECAUSE THEY HAVE CLOTHING ON

THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE DEAD IN A

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:54.067

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:55.235
THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO

01:52:55.301 --> 01:52:56.870
WALK AROUND AND POINT PEOPLE OUT

01:52:56.936 --> 01:52:58.104

NO WHERE THEY ARE THEY CERTAINLY.

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.712

01:53:05.778 --> 01:53:07.447
MENTALLY.

01:53:07.514 --> 01:53:09.149
SUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE

01:53:09.215 --> 01:53:10.150

01:53:10.216 --> 01:53:11.384
MEDICAL.

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:13.386
CONDITION THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE.

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:14.754
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE OF

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:18.458
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.

01:53:18.525 --> 01:53:19.526
CANNOT SURVIVE.

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:21.528
EVEN.

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:22.061
THEY CAN'T SURVIVE ON THE

01:53:22.128 --> 01:53:23.663
STREETS.

01:53:23.730 --> 01:53:25.999
BUT BECAUSE. OF THE WAY THE LAWS

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:27.767
ARE WRITTEN THEY ALSO CAN BE

01:53:27.834 --> 01:53:29.035
PLACED A CONSERVATORSHIP THEY

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:30.203
CANNOT BE COMPELLED TO TAKE

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.770
MEDICATION THAT WOULD EXTEND

01:53:30.837 --> 01:53:33.873
THEIR LIVES.

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.709
IT IS NOT HUMANE.

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:38.344
TOO DAMN THESE PEOPLE TO DIE

OF US THAT'S NOT HUMANE.

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:44.184
IT'S NOT HUMANE TO SAY THAT

01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:45.752
UNTIL THEY COMMIT A CRIME AND WE

01:53:45.818 --> 01:53:46.786
CAN LOCK THEM UP THEY CAN'T GET

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.354
HELP.

01:53:48.421 --> 01:53:50.089
AND YET BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE

01:53:50.156 --> 01:53:50.723
LAWS ARE WRITTEN THAT'S EXACTLY

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.726
WHAT HAPPENS.

01:53:53.793 --> 01:53:56.062
WE. THE AUTHORS UNDERSTAND THE

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:57.463
CONCERNS THAT SOME OF THE

01:53:58.865 --> 01:54:00.066

ADDRESSING THOSE AS THE BILL

01:54:01.701 --> 01:54:03.469
MOVES FORWARD. BUT DOING NOTHING

01:54:03.536 --> 01:54:05.972
IS NOT AN OPTION.

01:54:06.039 --> 01:54:07.173
SAYING THAT UNLESS SOMEONE IS AN

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:09.642
IMMEDIATE DANGER THEY CANNOT. BE

01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:11.311
HELD A CONSERVATORSHIP IS NOT AN

01:54:11.377 --> 01:54:12.912
OPTION PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

WHAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON

03:31:29.176 --> 03:31:30.611
IS INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF

03:31:30.677 --> 03:31:31.445

ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO LEAD TO A

03:31:36.283 --> 03:31:37.618
NEW STANDARD THAT WOULD MAKE

OBSOLETE. WATER METERS THAT ARE

03:31:39.486 --> 03:31:40.721
ALREADY THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THOSE.

03:31:48.529 --> 03:31:50.431

03:32:05.312 --> 03:32:07.214
BE REPLACED.

03:32:07.281 --> 03:32:09.049
THIS IS THE LEGISLATION.

03:32:09.116 --> 03:32:11.718
AND OTHER OTHER BILLS LIKE IT.

03:32:11.785 --> 03:32:13.487
HOW THEY'VE ALREADY PASSES HERE

03:32:13.554 --> 03:32:14.121
THAT IS GOING TO INCREASE THOSE

03:32:19.993 --> 03:32:21.762
TO CONSERVE OUR WATER IN IN

03:32:21.829 --> 03:32:22.830
DIFFERENT AREAS THEY'RE DOING

03:32:22.896 --> 03:32:24.598
DIFFERENT THINGS BASED ON THEIR

03:32:24.665 --> 03:32:25.632
LOCAL NEEDS BASED ON THE

FEASIBILITY. AND FINANCIAL

03:32:27.734 --> 03:32:29.436
ABILITY TO DO IT.

03:32:29.503 --> 03:32:30.771
THIS BILL DOESN'T TAKE THAT

03:32:30.838 --> 03:32:32.473
INTO ACCOUNT AND AGAIN TO GIVE

03:32:32.539 --> 03:32:34.074
THE POWER. TO AN UNELECTED

03:32:34.141 --> 03:32:35.309

DECISIONS FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR

03:32:36.543 --> 03:32:38.112
CONSUMERS

IT'S GOING TO INCREASE COSTS. IN

03:32:40.114 --> 03:32:42.649
AN UNNECESSARY FASHION AND SO

03:32:42.716 --> 03:32:43.250
I'D ASK FOR OPPOSITION TO THIS

03:32:43.317 --> 03:32:45.619

03:32:45.686 --> 03:32:47.354
SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR

REPEAT ONLY A FAX

03:32:55.596 --> 03:32:58.332
FUTURE WATER METERS. AND REALLY

03:32:58.398 --> 03:32:59.633
WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION IN

03:32:59.700 --> 03:33:00.801
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

03:33:00.868 --> 03:33:02.169
SIMPLY REQUIRE. THAT

PRODUCE EFFECTIVE WATER METERS I

03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:08.175
DON'T OVER OR UNDER BILL OUR

03:33:08.242 --> 03:33:09.243
CUSTOMERS I THINK THAT THAT'S

03:33:09.309 --> 03:33:10.644
REALLY A VERY REASONABLE

03:33:10.711 --> 03:33:12.112
STANDARD. I DON'T SEE HOW THAT

03:33:12.179 --> 03:33:13.514
WOULD INCREASE COSTS BUT YOU

03:33:13.580 --> 03:33:14.348
KNOW IT DOES INCREASE COSTS FOR

03:33:14.414 --> 03:33:16.016

YOU MAY PEOPLE PAY WHO CAN'T

03:33:24.057 --> 03:33:25.125
AFFORD TO PAY BECAUSE THEY'VE

03:33:25.192 --> 03:33:26.393
BEEN OVER BEING BEING OVER

03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:27.895
BILLED FOR YEARS AND NOBODY

03:33:27.961 --> 03:33:29.496
NOTICED BECAUSE NOBODY TESTED

03:33:29.563 --> 03:33:31.131
THOSE METERS AND THOSE METERS

03:33:31.198 --> 03:33:33.000
HAD NO BASIC STANDARDS. TO EVEN

03:33:33.066 --> 03:33:35.536
SHOW THAT THEY WERE EFFECTIVE.

03:33:35.602 --> 03:33:36.870
THIS WILL STOP THE OVERBILLING

03:33:36.937 --> 03:33:37.671
AND UNDER BILLING OF OUR

03:33:37.738 --> 03:33:39.506
CUSTOMERS AND JUST AS WE HAVE

03:33:39.573 --> 03:33:40.574
STANDARDS FOR MANY OTHER

03:33:40.641 --> 03:33:42.242
PRODUCTS THAT WE SAW IN THE

03:33:42.309 --> 03:33:43.243
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN IT'S

03:33:43.310 --> 03:33:45.078
SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WERE

03:33:45.145 --> 03:33:46.046
BILLING PEOPLE BASED ON THOSE

03:33:46.113 --> 03:33:47.281
PRODUCTS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

03:33:47.347 --> 03:33:49.883
SET STANDARDS FOR EFFICIENCY.

03:33:49.950 --> 03:33:52.085

04:02:47.920 --> 04:02:49.721
DO DO CALIFORNIA HISTORY IN

04:02:49.788 --> 04:02:51.256
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUT I THINK.

04:02:51.323 --> 04:02:54.092
WE NEED TO TEACH OF A BROADER.

04:02:54.159 --> 04:02:55.661
SUBJECT OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY IN

04:02:55.727 --> 04:02:58.397

04:03:08.473 --> 04:03:10.409
THERE WOULD BE MORE FLEXIBILITY

04:03:10.475 --> 04:03:11.643
AMONGST THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS

04:03:11.710 --> 04:03:13.645
TO TEACH.

04:03:13.712 --> 04:03:16.081
AND MAYBE EVEN MORE TO FOCUS IN

04:03:16.148 --> 04:03:16.982
ON THE LOCAL.

04:03:17.049 --> 04:03:18.951
HISTORY.

04:03:19.017 --> 04:03:20.652

04:04:30.956 --> 04:04:31.890
WRITING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I

04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:12.731
DON'T DISAGREE THAT ETHNIC

04:05:12.798 --> 04:05:14.900
STUDIES CAN BE.

04:05:14.966 --> 04:05:17.035
A A HELPFUL COURSE FOR STUDENTS

04:05:17.102 --> 04:05:19.738
TO TAKE BUT LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT

04:05:19.805 --> 04:05:21.106
OF THE FACT THAT.

04:05:21.173 --> 04:05:23.442
A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR COLLEGE

04:05:23.508 --> 04:05:24.709
STUDENTS HAVE TO TAKE REMEDIAL

04:05:24.776 --> 04:05:26.111
MATH.

04:05:26.178 --> 04:05:28.013
IN REMEDIAL ENGLISH

04:05:28.080 --> 04:05:30.148
WE HAVE A VERY LARGE SEGMENT OF

04:05:30.215 --> 04:05:31.950
OUR BLACK POPULATION CRISPUS

04:05:32.017 --> 04:05:33.618
BIGGER BOYS.

04:05:33.685 --> 04:05:34.886
WHO BY A CERTAIN AGE IN THEIR

04:05:34.953 --> 04:05:37.222
EDUCATIONAL CAREER? CAN'T READ

04:05:37.289 --> 04:05:38.824
AND WRITE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS

04:05:38.890 --> 04:05:39.291
THEIR AS THEIR WHITE

04:05:39.357 --> 04:05:41.526
COUNTERPARTS.

04:05:41.593 --> 04:05:43.795
I THINK MORE OF A FOCUS ON THE

04:05:43.862 --> 04:05:45.897
ESSENTIALS THE BASICS.

04:05:45.964 --> 04:05:47.632
FOR STUDENTS IS WHERE THE FOCUS

04:05:47.699 --> 04:05:48.800
SHOULD BE OF WE'RE GOING TO

04:05:48.867 --> 04:05:50.769
INCREASE FUNDING FOR THAT.

04:05:50.836 --> 04:05:52.237
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO

04:05:52.304 --> 04:05:54.239
ME BUT TO CONTINUE TO ADD THESE

04:05:54.306 --> 04:05:56.074
COURSES THAT ARE REQUIRED THAT

04:05:56.141 --> 04:05:56.708
ARE NOT GOING TO.

04:05:56.775 --> 04:05:59.111
.

04:05:59.177 --> 04:06:01.046
THERE IS NOT GOING TO ADVANCE

04:06:01.113 --> 04:06:01.813
THEIR.

04:06:01.880 --> 04:06:03.515
ABILITY TO.

04:06:03.582 --> 04:06:04.950
TO GET A JOB OR TO GET INTO

04:06:05.016 --> 04:06:06.551
COLLEGE ORDER START THEIR OWN

04:06:06.618 --> 04:06:08.787
BUSINESS LATER THIS IT'S HELPFUL

04:06:08.854 --> 04:06:10.655
IT'S INTERESTING IT'S

04:06:10.722 --> 04:06:12.124
ENCOURAGINGIT'S GOOD FOR ONE.

04:06:12.190 --> 04:06:13.658
TO NO ONE'S BACKGROUND AND WENT

04:06:13.725 --> 04:06:15.560
HISTORY BUT THERE ARE SO MANY

04:06:15.627 --> 04:06:16.928
OTHER ESSENTIAL IS THAT WE NEED

04:06:16.995 --> 04:06:17.996
TO FOCUS ON THAT I THINK

04:06:18.063 --> 04:06:19.231
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IF YOU

04:06:19.297 --> 04:06:21.066
READ THE REPORTS. WOULD AGREE

04:06:21.133 --> 04:06:23.301
THAT. WE ARE FAILING OUR

04:06:23.368 --> 04:06:25.137
STUDENTS.

04:06:25.203 --> 04:06:27.372
IN SO MANY WAYS SO IT'S NOT TO

04:06:27.439 --> 04:06:29.040
DISCOUNT.

04:06:29.107 --> 04:06:30.842
ON THE EFFORTS OF THIS BILL BUT

04:06:30.909 --> 04:06:32.410
I THINK.

04:06:32.477 --> 04:06:33.778
LET'S PLACE IMPORTANCE WHERE IT

04:06:33.845 --> 04:06:34.279
SHOULD BE.

04:06:34.346 --> 04:06:39.151
THANK YOU.

04:06:39.217 --> 04:06:42.053
MISTER SANTIAGO.

04:06:42.120 --> 04:06:43.455
I THINK YOUR SPEAKER KNOW WE

04:06:43.522 --> 04:06:45.790
HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE.

04:06:45.857 --> 04:06:48.994
OF EDUCATION TODAY.

04:06:49.060 --> 04:06:50.095
BUT BUT WHAT ALL SAY ABOUT A

04:06:50.162 --> 04:06:52.797
PEOPLE'S HISTORY.

04:06:52.864 --> 04:06:56.434
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT.

04:06:56.501 --> 04:06:58.303
THAT A THAT A PEOPLE IS EMPOWER.

04:06:58.370 --> 04:06:59.671
NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT OR FOR

04:06:59.738 --> 04:07:01.173
THOSE OF THOUGHT THAT ETHNIC

04:07:01.239 --> 04:07:02.908
STUDIES ARE LESS IMPORTANT.

04:07:02.974 --> 04:07:05.177
THEN OTHER STUDIES.

04:07:05.243 --> 04:07:07.579
LOOK I TOOK TO CONDUCT STUDIES.

04:07:07.646 --> 04:07:10.248
AND I WAS VERY PROUD OF IT.

04:07:10.315 --> 04:07:10.782
AND IT TAUGHT ME ABOUT MY

04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:12.484
PEOPLE'S HISTORY AND THEY GAVE

04:07:12.551 --> 04:07:13.351
ME A PASSION FOR WHAT I WANTED

04:07:13.418 --> 04:07:15.654
TO DO IN LIFE.

04:07:15.720 --> 04:07:18.056
SO SOMETIMES I MIGHT ARGUE.

04:07:18.123 --> 04:07:19.224
THAT THE OTHER COURSE WORK IS

04:07:19.291 --> 04:07:20.492
IMPORTANT.

04:07:20.559 --> 04:07:22.294
AND IT IS.

04:07:22.360 --> 04:07:23.795
BUT I MIGHT ARGUE.

04:07:23.862 --> 04:07:26.264
THAT THESE KIND OF COURSES.

04:07:26.331 --> 04:07:27.666
ARE EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT OR MORE

04:07:27.732 --> 04:07:29.401
ON POINT.

04:07:29.467 --> 04:07:30.702
THE EMPOWERMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY

04:07:30.769 --> 04:07:32.103
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THAT. DEVELOP

04:07:32.170 --> 04:07:34.406
THE SORT OF PEOPLE.

04:07:34.472 --> 04:07:35.574
WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN POSITIONS

04:07:35.640 --> 04:07:37.442
OF POWER?

04:07:37.509 --> 04:07:39.477
WHO WILL CARRY OUT POLICIES?

04:07:39.544 --> 04:07:40.745
BE IT IN THE CORPORATE WORLD.

04:07:40.812 --> 04:07:42.714
OR IF THE GOVERNMENT.

04:07:42.781 --> 04:07:44.849
OR LOCAL MUNICIPALITY.

04:07:44.916 --> 04:07:45.450
WHO HAVE THAT SCENE DRIVE AND

04:07:45.517 --> 04:07:45.650
ENERGY

04:07:47.285 --> 04:07:47.752
THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE

04:07:47.819 --> 04:07:49.688
MENTIONED WE SHOULD BROADEN THE

04:07:49.754 --> 04:07:51.223
BILL WE SHOULD DO THINGS OUR

04:07:51.289 --> 04:07:53.358
LOCAL. I. PIE WOULD DISAGREE SO

04:07:53.425 --> 04:07:55.560
CARRY OWN BILL.

04:07:55.627 --> 04:07:58.129
PASS IT TO THE LEGISLATURE.

04:07:58.196 --> 04:08:00.131
WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE ON THAT?

04:08:00.198 --> 04:08:02.467
AND AS WE AS A REFERENCE TO THE

04:08:02.534 --> 04:08:04.102
OTHER COURSES THAT ARE IMPORTANT.

04:08:04.169 --> 04:08:06.104

BECAUSE THERE ARE REAL IMPORTANT.

04:08:14.479 --> 04:08:17.282
HISTORICAL LESSONS.

04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:18.183
AND AND AND ACTIONS THAT TOOK

04:08:18.250 --> 04:08:19.784
PLACE.

04:08:19.851 --> 04:08:21.086
AS TO WHY SOME COMMUNITIES ARE

04:08:21.152 --> 04:08:23.688
THE WAY THEY ARE TODAY.

04:08:23.755 --> 04:08:24.256
AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

04:08:24.322 --> 04:08:25.223
STAND.

04:08:25.290 --> 04:08:28.026
THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT.

04:08:28.093 --> 04:08:29.794
DOES NOT HAVE POOR LATINOS

04:08:29.861 --> 04:08:30.395
BECAUSE THEY JUST ALL MOVED IT

04:08:30.462 --> 04:08:31.596
OUT AREA.

04:08:31.663 --> 04:08:33.431
WE DON'T HAVE LITTLE TOKYO

04:08:33.498 --> 04:08:35.166
BECAUSE IT'S JUST AS THERE WE

04:08:35.233 --> 04:08:36.901
DON'T HAVE CHINA TOWN ABOVE ME.

04:08:36.968 --> 04:08:38.036
ABOVE MY DISTRICT JUST BECAUSE

04:08:38.103 --> 04:08:38.937
SIMPLY PEOPLE WANTED TO MOVE

04:08:39.004 --> 04:08:40.772
THERE.

04:08:40.839 --> 04:08:41.239
THERE IS A HISTORICAL

04:08:41.306 --> 04:08:43.675
SIGNIFICANCE.

04:08:43.742 --> 04:08:44.209
AND MUCH OF IT WAS ABOUT A

04:08:44.276 --> 04:08:45.777
PRUSSIAN.

04:08:45.844 --> 04:08:46.845
IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE

04:08:46.911 --> 04:08:48.980
PEOPLE WHO WAS OPPRESSED.

04:08:49.047 --> 04:08:49.547
AND IF YOUR CULTURE WAS NOT

04:08:49.614 --> 04:08:50.482
OPPRESSED.

04:08:50.548 --> 04:08:52.584
GOD BLESS YOU.

04:08:52.651 --> 04:08:54.019
BUT MINE WAS AND IT WAS

04:08:54.085 --> 04:08:54.653
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO LEARN ABOUT

04:08:54.719 --> 04:08:55.820
IT.

04:08:55.887 --> 04:08:57.355
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATED ME

04:08:57.422 --> 04:08:59.190
TO BE HERE TODAY TOUGH FIGHT FOR

04:08:59.257 --> 04:09:01.126
THE BILL DOES VERY AND JUSTICES.

04:09:01.192 --> 04:09:03.061
AND WE CANNOT FORGET HIM. AND WE

04:09:03.128 --> 04:09:03.828
WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT BUT HE'S

04:09:03.895 --> 04:09:04.262
KIND OF COURSE OR.

04:09:04.329 --> 04:09:05.864
COURSES

PERCENT GO UNDER ON REPORTED.

05:07:10.178 --> 05:07:11.446
THERE IS A VERY REAL CONNECTION

05:07:11.513 --> 05:07:13.081
BETWEEN PAST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

05:07:13.148 --> 05:07:14.482

TRAGICALLY CHILDREN ARE THE MOST

05:07:19.287 --> 05:07:20.255

THERE IS A CONVICTION FOR

05:11:59.700 --> 05:12:01.969
MISDEMEANOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN

05:12:02.036 --> 05:12:03.638
A SITUATION WHERE A HUSBAND AND

05:12:03.704 --> 05:12:06.374
WIFE ARE BOYFRIEND AND GUARDINO

05:12:06.441 --> 05:12:06.641
WHATEVER.

05:12:06.707 --> 05:12:08.576
.

05:12:08.643 --> 05:12:10.978
ONE THINKS THE OTHER IS CHEATING

05:12:11.045 --> 05:12:12.547
ON THEM.

05:12:12.613 --> 05:12:15.116

HAVE A LIFETIME BAN. FOR OWNING

05:12:34.836 --> 05:12:36.137

LIKE THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS

05:12:37.472 --> 05:12:39.340
THAT FALL INTO THIS AREA THAT I

05:12:39.407 --> 05:12:40.274
THINK.

05:12:40.341 --> 05:12:42.910
MOST OF US WOULD AGREE PROBABLY

WHICH I THINK IS AN UNFAIR WAY

05:12:52.019 --> 05:12:53.521
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THERE'S

05:12:53.588 --> 05:12:55.456
PROBABLY SOME WAYS. THIS COULD

05:12:55.523 --> 05:12:56.624
BILL COULD BE TIGHTENED UP A

05:12:56.691 --> 05:12:58.893

CREDIT IS BEFORE US WE SHOULD

05:47:54.019 --> 05:47:55.788
ASK OURSELVES A SIMPLE QUESTION.

05:47:55.854 --> 05:47:57.256
IS A TAX CREDIT WARRANTED

05:47:57.323 --> 05:47:58.257

05:47:58.324 --> 05:48:00.125
CREATE JOBS IN OUR SECTOR IS

05:48:00.192 --> 05:48:01.927
CLEARLY A TAX CREDIT THAT WILL

05:48:01.994 --> 05:48:04.029
HELP TO CREATE JOBS RETAIN JOBS

05:48:04.096 --> 05:48:06.131

MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. AYE AFTER

05:48:16.075 --> 05:48:17.910
WATCHING THE THE EXCHANGE

05:48:17.977 --> 05:48:19.211
BETWEEN THE MEMBER FROM MY SAN

05:48:19.278 --> 05:48:20.746
FRANCISCO AND THE MEMBER FROM

05:48:20.813 --> 05:48:22.314
RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

05:48:22.381 --> 05:48:23.582
I THINK IT UNDERSCORES THE

05:48:23.649 --> 05:48:26.252
DANGER I IN TERMS OF TREADING

05:48:26.318 --> 05:48:28.988
INTO THIS. INTO THIS FEAR.

05:48:29.054 --> 05:48:29.989
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOVERNMENT

05:48:30.055 --> 05:48:32.424
FUNDING.

05:48:32.491 --> 05:48:33.826
IN GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE OR

05:48:33.892 --> 05:48:35.294
GOVERNMENT CREDITS.

05:48:35.361 --> 05:48:37.062
IN THIS AREA.

05:48:37.129 --> 05:48:38.097
PACIFIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

05:48:38.163 --> 05:48:39.265
INDUSTRY.

05:48:39.331 --> 05:48:40.799
WHICH IS

05:48:40.866 --> 05:48:42.835
IN THE REALM OF ART.

05:48:42.901 --> 05:48:46.772
AN IS IN THE REALM OF CULTURE.

05:48:46.839 --> 05:48:49.174
AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES.

05:48:49.241 --> 05:48:51.210
FOR AN INDUSTRY TO RECEIVE A

05:48:51.277 --> 05:48:53.779
MASSIVE TAX CREDIT LIKE THIS.

05:48:53.846 --> 05:48:55.514
SHOULD THEY BE PUSHED

05:48:55.581 --> 05:48:56.749
WITH THE HEAVY HAND OF

05:48:56.815 --> 05:48:59.485
GOVERNMENT ON THEIR CONTENT IN

05:48:59.551 --> 05:49:03.055
ORDER TO GET THE CASH.

05:49:03.122 --> 05:49:05.457
I THINK WE TRIED AND A VERY VERY.

05:49:05.524 --> 05:49:07.226
SERVING TERRITORY HERE.

05:49:07.293 --> 05:49:09.361
WHERE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MAY

05:49:09.428 --> 05:49:11.096
BE INSERTING IT'S POLITICS

05:49:11.163 --> 05:49:13.132
IT'S CULTURAL PRIORITIES?

05:49:13.198 --> 05:49:14.233
INTO THE CONTENT.

05:49:14.300 --> 05:49:15.734
OF ARTWORK

05:49:15.801 --> 05:49:17.536
INTO THE CONTENT.

05:49:17.603 --> 05:49:20.406
OF CULTURAL PIECES.

05:49:20.472 --> 05:49:21.440
THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT IT'S

05:49:21.507 --> 05:49:22.708
IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT GET

05:49:22.775 --> 05:49:24.243
INVOLVED IN THIS SPHERE. AND

05:49:24.310 --> 05:49:25.978

LAWS ARE REGULATION AND ALL THE

05:49:36.855 --> 05:49:37.723
OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE IT A

05:49:37.790 --> 05:49:39.158

06:13:03.761 --> 06:13:05.830
PAROLE IS NOT AUTOMATIC.

06:13:05.896 --> 06:13:07.798
PAROLE HAPPENS BECAUSE PEOPLE

06:13:07.865 --> 06:13:10.468
HAVE CHANGED THEIR LIVES.

06:13:10.534 --> 06:13:11.502
WE SHOULD GIVE PEOPLE AN

06:13:11.569 --> 06:13:14.171
OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE OUR LIVES.

06:13:14.238 --> 06:13:16.173

THAT LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY

06:13:26.383 --> 06:13:28.452

06:13:36.227 --> 06:13:38.629
MISTAKE AND TO TURN THEIR LIVES

06:13:38.696 --> 06:13:40.397

06:13:40.464 --> 06:13:41.332
INCENTIVE OF GETTING OUT ON

06:13:41.398 --> 06:13:43.000
PAROLE.

06:13:43.067 --> 06:13:45.202
WILL AND CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE

06:13:45.269 --> 06:13:46.504

THE YEARS AS WE HAVE MADE AN

06:16:21.625 --> 06:16:23.160
OVERCROWDED PRISON SYSTEM.

06:16:23.227 --> 06:16:24.428
WELL WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND

06:16:24.495 --> 06:16:26.297
EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRISON

THESE ADDITIONAL THINGS TO THE

06:16:44.748 --> 06:16:45.849
LIST.

06:16:45.916 --> 06:16:47.384
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY

06:16:47.451 --> 06:16:48.819
TO PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR RIGHT

06:16:48.886 --> 06:16:50.487
NOW AND WE DO.

06:16:50.554 --> 06:16:51.922
IT BOTHERS ME THAT WE HAVE NOT

LEARNED FROM THE PAST.

06:16:53.857 --> 06:16:55.726
BUT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THE SAME

06:16:55.793 --> 06:16:57.761
MISTAKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN BIDE

06:16:57.828 --> 06:16:59.263
ONCE AGAIN FOCUSING ON A

06:16:59.330 --> 06:17:01.165
SPECIFIC CRIME CREATING MORE

06:17:01.231 --> 06:17:02.766

BILLION DOLLARS TO OUR PRISON

06:17:09.039 --> 06:17:10.774
BUDGET WHICH TAKES A BILLION OUT

06:17:10.841 --> 06:17:12.743
OF OUR SCHOOLS. AND NOW WE HAVE

06:17:12.810 --> 06:17:13.978

RECLAIM THEIR LIVES.

06:17:17.614 --> 06:17:20.050
SO WE HAVE DONE WE WE TAKE ONE

06:17:20.117 --> 06:17:20.918
STEP FORWARD AND THEN FOUR STEPS

06:17:20.985 --> 06:17:22.586

WE WAS WITH FAILED TO LISTEN TO

06:17:23.921 --> 06:17:25.389
WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

06:17:25.456 --> 06:17:26.523
HAS SAID ABOUT THEIR OWN PRISON

06:17:26.590 --> 06:17:28.325
SYSTEM WHEN THEY PASSED THE

06:17:28.392 --> 06:17:30.060
PROPOSITION. AND WE A COSTLY

IT'S GOING TO BE AND WHO'S GOING

06:17:43.907 --> 06:17:44.975
TO GET OUT OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO

06:17:45.042 --> 06:17:47.177
BE PROTECTED. WITHOUT REALIZING

06:17:47.244 --> 06:17:48.946
THAT WE FELT NO SAFER WITH A

06:17:49.013 --> 06:17:50.080
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND

06:17:50.147 --> 06:17:51.749

LOOKING CAREFULLY AT WHERE WE

06:18:03.594 --> 06:18:04.661
HAVE BEEN?

06:18:04.728 --> 06:18:06.630
AND WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

06:18:06.697 --> 06:18:08.098
WE SHOULD LEARN FROM MY HISTORY

06:18:08.165 --> 06:18:09.633
AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T LEARN FROM

06:18:09.700 --> 06:18:10.934
THEIR HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO MAKE

06:18:11.001 --> 06:18:12.970
THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER

06:18:13.037 --> 06:18:14.738

06:18:23.547 --> 06:18:24.815
WE TAKE PRIDE ABOUT WHERE WE'RE

06:18:24.882 --> 06:18:26.784
GOING. INSTEAD OF UNRAVELING

06:18:26.850 --> 06:18:28.886
EVERYTHING SO QUICKLY AND MAKING

06:18:28.952 --> 06:18:31.088
OURSELVES BACK WHERE WE STARTED.

06:18:31.155 --> 06:18:32.723
WITH NOT JUST THE LARGEST PRISON

06:18:32.790 --> 06:18:33.891
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD BUT THE MOST

06:18:33.957 --> 06:18:35.859
RIDICULOUSLY LARGEST PRISON

06:18:35.926 --> 06:18:38.162
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. I URGE YOU

06:18:38.228 --> 06:18:39.063

06:18:39.129 --> 06:18:40.764
BILL I URGE YOU TO TAKE SOME

06:18:40.831 --> 06:18:42.599

06:18:44.902 --> 06:18:46.270
FOLKS MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT

06:18:46.336 --> 06:18:48.138
WHAT WE'RE DOING AND NOT SIMPLY

06:18:48.205 --> 06:18:49.973
RUSH IN BECAUSE THE PUBLIC IS

06:18:50.040 --> 06:18:51.842
WATCHING US AND WE DON'T WANT TO

06:18:51.909 --> 06:18:53.444
SEEM TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF RAPISTS.

06:18:53.510 --> 06:18:54.645
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THIS

06:18:54.711 --> 06:18:56.080
FLOOR IS SUPPORTIVE OF RAPIST.

06:18:56.146 --> 06:18:58.549
NONE OF US ARE.

06:18:58.615 --> 06:18:59.616

KNOW JUST OF A DISTANCE IS NOT

06:19:00.984 --> 06:19:02.453
IT'S A VIOLENT ACT AGAINST A

06:19:02.519 --> 06:19:04.888
WOMAN AND SOMETIMES AGAINST MAN.

06:19:04.955 --> 06:19:06.256
WE'RE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF A BUT

06:19:06.323 --> 06:19:08.158
THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION AND

06:19:08.225 --> 06:19:10.027
WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT YEAR AFTER

06:19:10.094 --> 06:19:11.562
YEAR AFTER YEAR AND WILL

06:19:11.628 --> 06:19:12.763
CONTINUE TO MAKE THE SAME

06:19:12.830 --> 06:19:14.364
MISTAKE AGAIN WHAT. THE MEDIA

07:33:10.329 --> 07:33:11.731
I THINK THE DISCUSSION ON THIS

07:33:11.797 --> 07:33:13.132
ISSUE HAS BEEN MISLEADING

07:33:13.199 --> 07:33:15.067
BECAUSE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

07:33:15.134 --> 07:33:16.402
REGARDING OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING.

07:33:16.469 --> 07:33:18.170
ARE TO PARK.

07:33:18.237 --> 07:33:20.072
STATE JURISDICTION IS WITHIN

07:33:20.139 --> 07:33:21.440
THREE MILES OF THE COAST LINE

07:33:21.507 --> 07:33:23.142
AND NOBODY'S DEBATING HERE

07:33:23.209 --> 07:33:24.577
WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE ANY

07:33:24.644 --> 07:33:27.213
EXPANDED OIL PRODUCTION OR ANY

07:33:27.280 --> 07:33:28.981
NEW PLATFORMS WITHIN THAT AREA.

07:33:29.048 --> 07:33:30.016
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM

07:33:30.082 --> 07:33:31.350
VERY PERFECTLY CLEAR I'M IN

07:33:31.417 --> 07:33:33.819
OPPOSITION TO ANY NEW PLATFORMS.

07:33:33.886 --> 07:33:35.454
WITHIN OUR STATE WATERS

07:33:35.521 --> 07:33:37.256
I'M ALSO VERY AWARE THAT THERE'S

07:33:37.323 --> 07:33:39.191
NOT INTEREST I ESPECIALLY IN

07:33:39.258 --> 07:33:41.994
ORANGE COUNTY AREA AYE IN HAVING

07:33:42.061 --> 07:33:44.330
NEW NEW NEW PLATFORMS IT'S JUST

07:33:44.397 --> 07:33:46.465
NOT THERE BECAUSE THE OIL. FIELD

07:33:46.532 --> 07:33:47.867
IN THE AREA HAS BEEN PUMP FOR

07:33:47.934 --> 07:33:50.870
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND IT

07:33:50.937 --> 07:33:52.171
ALREADY HAS THE A BILL BUT.

07:33:52.238 --> 07:33:54.073
FOLKS WHO ARE OR PRODUCING WELL

07:33:54.140 --> 07:33:55.207
ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE

07:33:55.274 --> 07:33:57.243
ABLE TO GET TO THE OIL AYE THAT

07:33:57.310 --> 07:33:57.677
IS WITHIN THE AREA.

07:33:57.743 --> 07:33:59.445
WHAT'S IT

07:33:59.512 --> 07:34:01.213
QUESTION HERE IS NOT THE STATE

07:34:01.280 --> 07:34:02.815
WATERS

07:34:02.882 --> 07:34:05.151
IT'S ABOUT THE FEDERAL WATERS

07:34:05.217 --> 07:34:06.319
AND WHETHER THE STATE OF

07:34:06.385 --> 07:34:07.987
CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO TRY TO

07:34:08.054 --> 07:34:09.922
BLOCK.

07:34:09.989 --> 07:34:11.991
TRANSPORTATION OF ANY NEW

07:34:12.058 --> 07:34:13.993
PRODUCTION FROM FEDERAL WATERS

07:34:14.060 --> 07:34:15.595
WHICH I WOULD ARGUE ISA

07:34:15.661 --> 07:34:17.430
VIOLATION OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE

07:34:17.496 --> 07:34:19.565
WITHIN OUR COUNTRY.

07:34:19.632 --> 07:34:20.633
WE'RE NOT HERE TO JUST SIMPLY

07:34:20.700 --> 07:34:21.867
BLOCKED THIS IS LIKE SAYING THAT

07:34:21.934 --> 07:34:23.235
YOU CAN HAVE.

07:34:23.302 --> 07:34:26.005
ANY OIL LOW ON OIL CARS ON A

07:34:26.072 --> 07:34:27.540
RAILROAD COMING THROUGH A

07:34:27.607 --> 07:34:29.542
CERTAIN PART OF CALIFORNIA. I

07:34:29.609 --> 07:34:30.943
THIS IS JUST SIMPLY BLOCKING

07:34:31.010 --> 07:34:32.645
COMMERCE THROUGH THE STATE

07:34:32.712 --> 07:34:33.913
WATERS.

07:34:33.980 --> 07:34:35.815
FEDERAL WATERS ARE A QUESTION

07:34:35.881 --> 07:34:38.551
FOR CONGRESS.

07:34:38.618 --> 07:34:39.719

OR RESOLVE WORKPLACE DISPUTES

08:07:34.658 --> 08:07:35.960
INSTEAD IT SIMPLY REQUIRES

08:07:36.026 --> 08:07:38.228
EMPLOYEES CHOOSE TO SIGN SUCH

08:07:38.295 --> 08:07:38.996

08:07:58.749 --> 08:08:00.351

THIS IS A PRIORITY WOMEN'S

08:08:02.319 --> 08:08:03.120
CAUCUS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY

08:08:03.187 --> 08:08:05.723
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

08:08:05.789 --> 08:08:08.225
WITH YOUR KILEY.

08:08:08.292 --> 08:08:09.693
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THE

08:08:09.760 --> 08:08:10.628
PROPONENTS WOULD HAVE YOU

08:08:10.694 --> 08:08:12.463
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL

08:08:12.529 --> 08:08:14.765
SOMEHOW HELP I TO ADDRESS THE

08:08:14.832 --> 08:08:16.300
EXTREMELY SERIOUS PROBLEM. OF

08:08:16.367 --> 08:08:17.901
SEXUALHARASSMENT AND OTHER

08:08:17.968 --> 08:08:19.436
WORKPLACE MISCONDUCT

08:08:19.503 --> 08:08:21.705
I IT DOES NO SUCH THING.

08:08:21.772 --> 08:08:23.173
WHAT THE BILL REALLY DOES IS

08:08:23.240 --> 08:08:25.776
PUSH FOR A LONG STANDING

08:08:25.843 --> 08:08:28.312
PREEXISTING POLITICAL AGENDA?

08:08:28.379 --> 08:08:29.780
DESIGNED TO FINANCIALLY BENEFIT

08:08:29.847 --> 08:08:31.949
ONE GROUP AT THE EXPENSE OF

08:08:32.016 --> 08:08:32.750
WORKERS.

08:08:32.816 --> 08:08:35.486
AND VICTIMS.

08:08:35.552 --> 08:08:37.187
THE BILL'S GOAL IS TAKE MORE AND

08:08:37.254 --> 08:08:39.223
MORE CASES AWAY FROM THE FORUM

08:08:39.289 --> 08:08:40.858
OF ARBITRATION.

08:08:40.924 --> 08:08:42.159
WHERE VICTIMS CAN RECEIVE

08:08:42.226 --> 08:08:43.927
COMPENSATION MORE QUICKLY?

08:08:43.994 --> 08:08:45.796
WITH A LOWER LEGAL COSTS

08:08:45.863 --> 08:08:46.830
AND WITH GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND

08:08:46.897 --> 08:08:48.799
MOVE THOSE CASES

08:08:48.866 --> 08:08:49.500
INTO ARE ALREADY OVERWHELMED

08:08:49.566 --> 08:08:51.168
COURTS.

08:08:51.235 --> 08:08:52.369
WHERE PROCEEDINGS ARE MORE

08:08:52.436 --> 08:08:54.571
PROTRACTED AND THOUGHTS BEES FOR

08:08:54.638 --> 08:08:56.206
LAWYERS ARE OF COURSE MUCH

08:08:56.273 --> 08:08:58.676
MUCH HIGHER?

08:08:58.742 --> 08:09:00.244
THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO

08:09:00.310 --> 08:09:02.046
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS BUT.

08:09:02.112 --> 08:09:03.981
SWEEPS IN ALL CLAIMS UNDER THE

FLARE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND

08:09:06.083 --> 08:09:07.851
HOUSING ACT AND THE LABOR CODE.

08:09:07.918 --> 08:09:09.186
IT ALSO DOES NOT GIVE.

08:09:09.253 --> 08:09:11.622
WORKERS ANY NEW SUBSTANTIVE

08:09:11.689 --> 08:09:14.324
RIGHTS BUT SIMPLY CHANGES THE

08:09:14.391 --> 08:09:15.426
FORUM IN WHICH CLAIMS WILL BE

08:09:15.492 --> 08:09:16.960
ADJUDICATED.

08:09:17.027 --> 08:09:18.062
THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE A

08:09:18.128 --> 08:09:19.630
VICTIM OF DISCRIMINATION BASED

08:09:19.697 --> 08:09:21.732

HARASSMENT. YOUR ONLY OPTION

08:09:27.738 --> 08:09:28.972
FORGETTING JUSTICE

08:09:29.039 --> 08:09:31.442
WILL BE LITIGATION.

08:09:31.508 --> 08:09:33.844
NOW SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN.

08:09:33.911 --> 08:09:36.280
THIS IS NOT A REALISTIC OPTION.

08:09:36.346 --> 08:09:38.716
FOR LOW WAGE EMPLOYEES.

08:09:38.782 --> 08:09:40.017
WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD A

08:09:40.084 --> 08:09:41.351
LAWYER?

08:09:41.418 --> 08:09:42.686
WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO

08:09:42.753 --> 08:09:44.388
WAIT YEARS?

08:09:44.455 --> 08:09:46.590
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION

08:09:46.657 --> 08:09:48.392
WHO MAY WORK MULTIPLE JOBS AND

08:09:48.459 --> 08:09:49.960
NOT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IN

08:09:50.027 --> 08:09:52.362
ORDER TO PROSECUTE A YEARS LONG

08:09:52.429 --> 08:09:54.398
CIVIL ACTION AS ONE ARTICLE IN

08:09:54.465 --> 08:09:55.666
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW

08:09:55.733 --> 08:09:57.634
REVIEW PUT IT. THE VAST MAJORITY

08:09:57.701 --> 08:09:58.936
OF ORDINARY LOWER AND MIDDLE

08:09:59.002 --> 08:10:00.938
INCOME EMPLOYEES CANNOT GET

08:10:01.004 --> 08:10:02.539
ACCESS TO THE COURTS TO

08:10:02.606 --> 08:10:04.141
VINDICATE THEIR CONTRACTUAL OR

08:10:04.208 --> 08:10:05.709
STATUTORY RIGHTS

08:10:05.776 --> 08:10:07.244
THERE ARE ONLY PRACTICAL HOPE IS

08:10:07.311 --> 08:10:09.646
THE GENERALLY CHEAPER. FASTER

08:10:09.713 --> 08:10:11.181
AND MORE INFORMAL PROCESS

08:10:11.248 --> 08:10:13.851
OF ARBITRATION.

08:10:13.917 --> 08:10:16.353
NUMEROUS STUDIES ALSO SHOW. THAT

08:10:16.420 --> 08:10:18.455
EMPLOYEES GENERALLY WIN THE SAME

08:10:18.522 --> 08:10:19.256
PERCENTAGE OF CASES IN

08:10:19.323 --> 08:10:20.691
ARBITRATION.

08:10:20.758 --> 08:10:22.726
IF NOT MORE.

08:10:22.793 --> 08:10:24.762
NOW TO BE FAIR THERE IS SOME

08:10:24.828 --> 08:10:27.364
CONFLICTING DATA ON THIS POINT I

08:10:27.431 --> 08:10:29.466
GOVERNOR BROWN FOR HIS PART IN

08:10:29.533 --> 08:10:30.968
VETOING A SIMILAR BILL. A FEW

08:10:31.034 --> 08:10:33.237
YEARS AGO SAID THIS

08:10:33.303 --> 08:10:35.305
THE EVIDENCE ON ACTUAL OUTCOMES

08:10:35.372 --> 08:10:37.107
AN ARBITRATION VERSES LITIGATION

08:10:37.174 --> 08:10:38.742
IS CONFLICTING AND UNCLEAR. WITH

08:10:38.809 --> 08:10:40.444
SOME STUDIES SHOWING EMPLOYEES

08:10:40.511 --> 08:10:42.045
RECEIVING MORE IN ARBITRATION

08:10:42.112 --> 08:10:43.647
WHILE OTHER STUDIES SHOW THE

08:10:43.714 --> 08:10:46.250
OPPOSITE BUT EVEN IF IT'S A WASH.

08:10:46.316 --> 08:10:47.951
ARBITRATION IS STILL VASTLY

08:10:48.018 --> 08:10:49.386
PREFERABLE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY

08:10:49.453 --> 08:10:51.088
OF EMPLOYEES

08:10:51.155 --> 08:10:52.156
BECAUSE MORAL BE ABLE GET ACCESS

08:10:52.222 --> 08:10:53.857
TO IT.

08:10:53.924 --> 08:10:54.792
THEY'RE POSSIBLY MUCH LOWER THAN

08:10:54.858 --> 08:10:56.193
BE ABLE TO KEEP MORE OF THEIR

08:10:56.260 --> 08:10:57.861
AWARD RATHER THAN GOING TO

08:10:57.928 --> 08:10:59.530
ATTORNEYS AND THEY'LL GET THE

08:10:59.596 --> 08:11:01.431
REWARDS MORE QUICKLY. AND WITH

08:11:01.498 --> 08:11:03.433
GREATER FINALLY.

08:11:03.500 --> 08:11:05.269
FOR THOSE REASONS THIS BILL WILL

08:11:05.335 --> 08:11:06.236
DO GREAT DAMAGE.

08:11:06.303 --> 08:11:08.071
TO WORKERS

08:11:08.138 --> 08:11:09.206
AND TO VICTIMS BY LIMITING THEIR

08:11:09.273 --> 08:11:10.808
ACCESS.

08:11:10.874 --> 08:11:12.109
TO JUSTICE BUT PERHAPS WORST OF

08:11:12.176 --> 08:11:14.278
ALL.

08:11:14.344 --> 08:11:16.446
THE BILL ALSO MAKES VICTIMS IN

08:11:16.513 --> 08:11:17.815
SOME CASES THE LESS LIKELY TO

08:11:17.881 --> 08:11:19.883
COME FORWARD.

08:11:19.950 --> 08:11:21.251
FOR THOSE WHO WOULD PREFER THE

08:11:21.318 --> 08:11:23.187
CONFIDENTIALITY OFFERED BY

08:11:23.253 --> 08:11:25.489
ARBITRATION I WOULD NOT RATHER

08:11:25.556 --> 08:11:26.590
NOT HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR

08:11:26.657 --> 08:11:29.293
EXPERIENCES. IN OPEN COURT OVER

08:11:29.359 --> 08:11:32.796
POTENTIALLY SEVERAL YEARS.

08:11:32.863 --> 08:11:33.997
IN ANY CASE THIS BILL IS

08:11:34.064 --> 08:11:35.966
OBVIOUSLY PREEMPTED BY THE

08:11:36.033 --> 08:11:37.601
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT IT'S NOT

08:11:37.668 --> 08:11:39.436
EVEN CLOSE JUST LIKE A BILL THIS

08:11:39.503 --> 08:11:40.604
LEGISLATURE PASSED IN TWO

08:11:40.671 --> 08:11:42.005
THOUSAND FOURTEEN.

08:11:42.072 --> 08:11:43.207
PURPORTING TO LIMIT ARBITRATION

08:11:43.273 --> 08:11:44.308
WAS JUST STRUCK DOWN BY

08:11:44.374 --> 08:11:46.009
CALIFORNIA APPELLATE COURT THIS

08:11:46.076 --> 08:11:48.579
YEAR BUT IN THE MEANTIME IN THE

08:11:48.645 --> 08:11:50.080
YEARS IN WHICH THE BILL IS IN

08:11:50.147 --> 08:11:51.348
LEGAL THEM LEGAL LIMBO. IT'LL

08:11:51.415 --> 08:11:53.217
CAUSE GREAT HARM TO WORKERS TO

08:11:53.283 --> 08:11:55.919
VICTIMS AND OUR STATE AS A WHOLE

08:11:55.986 --> 08:11:58.822
I URGE A NO VOTE.

08:11:58.889 --> 08:12:03.627
DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

08:12:03.694 --> 08:12:05.062
MISTER SPEAKER UP. THIS GIVES ME

08:12:05.128 --> 08:12:07.030
AN MEMBERS.

08:12:07.097 --> 08:12:08.498
I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ALL A B.

08:12:08.565 --> 08:12:10.234
THIRTY EIGHTY AND I THINK IT'S

08:12:10.300 --> 08:12:11.301
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT

08:12:11.368 --> 08:12:13.103
THIS IS NOT A.

08:12:13.170 --> 08:12:14.872
PROEHL NORD ANTI ARBITRATION

08:12:14.938 --> 08:12:16.840
BILL. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

08:12:16.907 --> 08:12:18.675
CHOICE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE

08:12:18.742 --> 08:12:20.644
ABLE TO CHOOSE IF THEY WANT TO

08:12:20.711 --> 08:12:22.179
ENGAGE IN ARBITRATION.

08:12:22.246 --> 08:12:24.114
IT SHOULD NOT BE FORCED UPON YOU

08:12:24.181 --> 08:12:26.149
AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT BUT

08:12:26.216 --> 08:12:27.718
IF YOU WANNA TAKE THIS JOB YOU

08:12:27.784 --> 08:12:28.986
MUST SIGN THIS ARBITRATION

08:12:29.052 --> 08:12:30.554
AGREEMENT IN ADVANCE.

08:12:30.621 --> 08:12:32.022
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF

08:12:32.089 --> 08:12:34.024
YOU WANT TO SIGN THE ARBITRATION

08:12:34.091 --> 08:12:35.792
AGREEMENT. AND SO WHEN WE START

08:12:35.859 --> 08:12:37.394
TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO BE

08:12:37.461 --> 08:12:39.096
FASTER AND CHEAPER AND SO FORTH

08:12:39.162 --> 08:12:40.998
AND SO ON MAYBE IT WILL BE AND

08:12:41.064 --> 08:12:43.267
IF IT IS A CHOICE THAT YOU MAKE.

08:12:43.333 --> 08:12:44.501
WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT BE FORCED

08:12:44.568 --> 08:12:47.170
TO SIGN IT IN ORDER TO GET A JOB

08:12:47.237 --> 08:12:47.738
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT'S

08:12:47.804 --> 08:12:49.840
IMPORTANT YOU TALK ABOUT DENIAL

08:12:49.907 --> 08:12:51.642
OF JUSTICE THAT IS THE DENIAL OF

08:12:51.708 --> 08:12:53.143
JUSTICE IN ITSELF IF I CAN'T

08:12:53.210 --> 08:12:54.811
CHOOSE. WHETHER I WANT TO GO TO

08:12:54.878 --> 08:12:56.647
COURT OF ARBITRATION BECAUSE I'M

08:12:56.713 --> 08:12:58.015
FORCED TO SIGN ARBITRATION

08:12:58.081 --> 08:13:00.017
AGREEMENTS IN ADVANCE THEM THAT

08:13:00.083 --> 08:13:02.019
BASICALLY DENIES MY RIGHT TO GO

08:13:02.085 --> 08:13:03.553
TO COURT AND TO HAVE WHATEVER

08:13:03.620 --> 08:13:05.622
FORM OF JUSTICE IN LITIGATION

08:13:05.689 --> 08:13:06.223
THAT OCCURS.

08:13:06.290 --> 08:13:07.357
IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT

08:13:07.424 --> 08:13:09.192
PEOPLE IN ARBITRATION ARE NOT

08:13:09.259 --> 08:13:11.094
REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE LAW. AND

08:13:11.161 --> 08:13:12.496
MANY OF YOU DON'T KNOW MAY NOT

08:13:12.562 --> 08:13:14.064
KNOW THAT BUT IF THEY ARE NOT

08:13:14.131 --> 08:13:15.732
REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE LAW WHEN

08:13:15.799 --> 08:13:17.367
YOU DEAL WITH ARBITRATORS. I

08:13:17.434 --> 08:13:18.335
KNOW BECAUSE I WANT TO

08:13:18.402 --> 08:13:20.037
ARBITRATION ONCE I'LL NEVER GO

08:13:20.103 --> 08:13:21.405
AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

08:13:21.471 --> 08:13:23.473
REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND

08:13:23.540 --> 08:13:24.608
THE AND THEREFORE YOU BASICALLY

08:13:24.675 --> 08:13:25.809
MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHAT YOU

08:13:25.876 --> 08:13:26.977
THINK IS BEST THE ARBITRATOR

08:13:27.044 --> 08:13:28.378
DOES.

08:13:28.445 --> 08:13:29.479
IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST FORM

08:13:29.546 --> 08:13:31.181
OF GOVERNMENT YES IT IS FAST

08:13:31.248 --> 08:13:32.716
IT'S QUICK BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS

08:13:32.783 --> 08:13:34.284
GET THE JUSTICE THAT YOU WANT.

08:13:34.351 --> 08:13:36.219
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL

08:13:36.286 --> 08:13:37.387
IS NOT ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE

08:13:37.454 --> 08:13:39.656
ARBITRATION IS HOW WONDERFUL

08:13:39.723 --> 08:13:41.291
ARBITRATION IS THIS IS SAYS THAT

08:13:41.358 --> 08:13:43.560
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE IF I

08:13:43.627 --> 08:13:45.062
WANT TO GO TO ARBITRATION. ARE

08:13:45.128 --> 08:13:46.430
NOT AND THAT SHOULD BE THE

08:14:58.001 --> 08:15:00.203
IN THIS BILL. THAT WOULD NOT

08:15:00.270 --> 08:15:01.705
ALLOW SOMEBODY TO SEEK

08:15:17.387 --> 08:15:18.655

REQUIRE PEOPLE THE SIGN AND DA'S

08:15:43.046 --> 08:15:44.714
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE

08:15:44.781 --> 08:15:47.451
