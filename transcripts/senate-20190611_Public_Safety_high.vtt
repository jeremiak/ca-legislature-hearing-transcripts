TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.249
TO THE BILL WINNER STAND THE

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.450
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:04.851
ABOUT.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.186
PARTICULAR USE OF TECHNOLOGY --

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.589
I I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD NOTE

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.425
THAT -- THE RESPONSE THESE

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.260
CONCERNS -- IT IS AN APPROPRIATE

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.430
IN TERMS OF A BLANKET BAN -- THE

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:19.365
THE PROPONENTS NOTE AND I THINK

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.000
WE LARGELY AGREE THAT.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.435
IF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS IN USE

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:26.372
IT'S NOT IN WIDE USE AND THE

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.708
RESPONSE TO THESE CONCERNS WELL.

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:30.176
THEY MAY BE FAIR CONCERNS. TO

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.844
TAKE AWAY THAT AUTHORITY TO TAKE

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.380
AWAY A TOOL COMPLETELY WITHOUT

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.649
SORT OF ANY.

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.217
THE NOTION OF LET'S ADDRESS WHAT

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.920
THE PROBLEM IS -- THAT IT WOULD

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:41.954
JUST THINK IT'S A IT'S AN

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.389
INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE I THINK

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.557
THERE ARE -- POTENTIALLY VERY

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:46.292
STRONG USES FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.127
WHETHER IT'S HELPING REDACTING

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.262
BODY CAM FOOTAGE MAKING SURE

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:51.564
THAT -- CERTAIN PEOPLE SHOULDN'T

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:52.498
BE IDENTIFIED WHEN THE FOOTAGE

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.500
IS RELEASED -- HELPING TO

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.335
IDENTIFY SUSPECTS OR EXONERATE

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:59.939
POTENTIAL SUSPECTS -- IT JUST

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:01.807
JUST AGAIN THIS THIS TAKING AWAY

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:04.577
OF THE TOOL -- WITHOUT SORT OF

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.045
ANY YOU KNOW LET'S HAVE A

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:07.880
DISCUSSION LET'S HAVE A LOOK

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:08.748
HAVE A COMMUNITY MEETING WHAT'S

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:10.316
HAVE A SOME STANDARD WHERE WE

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.185
LOOK AT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:13.920
RESPONSES.

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.388
WE JUST WE'RE I THINK WE'RE JUST

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.822
CONCERNED ABOUT TAKING WITH IT

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.024
TOO I THINK THE OTHER NOTION TO

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.593
IS THAT -- THE BODY CAMS ARE

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.461
SOLELY FOR OFFICER TRANSPARENCY

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:23.529
AND ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK A

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.164
SHORT SIGHTED THEY CLEARLY HAVE.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.566
INVESTIGATIVE USE THEY HAVE USE

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:29.936
THAT NOT ONLY -- PROTECT THE

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.871
PUBLIC FROM YOU KNOW MISBEHAVIOR

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.172
BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.141
THE EXTENT IT HAPPENS IT ALSO

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:35.775
PROTECTS LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:36.676
OFFICERS FROM.

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.244
CRIMINAL OR MISS BEHAVIOR OF THE

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.246
PUBLIC AND IT HELPS TELL A STORY

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.181
IT'S NOT A PANACEA IT DOESN'T

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.382
REVEAL EVERYTHING THAT HAS

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:44.984
HAPPENED AND OFTEN DISPLACE ONE

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:45.217
ANGLE.

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:47.086
AND ONE PERSPECTIVE BUT IT DOES

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:49.021
HELP TELL A STORY AND SO AGAIN

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:51.090
TAKING AWAY THAT TOOL -- WE

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:53.326
THINK HAS CONSEQUENCES THAT

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.427
DON'T NECESSARILY OUTWEIGH THE

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:59.198
PERCEIVED CONCERNED SO FOR THOSE

00:09:59.265 --> 00:09:59.799
REASONS WE ASK YOU KNOW THANK

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:02.234
YOU.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.035
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DILUTION

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:03.836
HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LOS

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.404
ANGELES POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE --

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:06.706
WE'VE BEEN IN AND I THINK SOME

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.541
INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:11.577
AUTHORS OFFICE CONCERNING OUR A

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:12.712
POSITION WHICH SUPPOSED UNLESS

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.448
AMENDED -- NOT -- TO

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:22.455
REGURGITATOR REITERATE -- MOST.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.023
OF MY COLLEAGUE RAISED BUT

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.857
THERE'S SOME OTHER ASPECTS TO

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:25.992
FACIAL RECOGNITION THAT WE THINK

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:28.394
ARE ARE I THINK IMPORTANT I

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.628
THINK WE WOULD ADVOCATE.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:31.464
FOR SITTING DOWN AT THE TABLE

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.432
AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.667
BEST TO REGULATE USE OF THE

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.535
TECHNOLOGY I'LL GIVE YOU A

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:39.238
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES -- WHILE IT'S

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.574
NOT WIDELY IN USE IN AND I THINK

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.444
THERE IS SOME UNDERSTANDING THAT.

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:46.879
THE MAN ONE OF THE LOS ANGELES

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:47.713
POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE ACTUALLY

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.483
ACTIVELY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:51.450
THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:53.686
CASE -- BUT WE SEE VALUE IN THE

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:56.889
EAST THE TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE --

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:59.725
TO IDENTIFY MISSING PERSONS.

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:02.061
SO IN ANY INSTANCES WHERE.

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.329
YOU KNOW FACIAL RECOGNITION

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:05.264
TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED IN

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.666
COMBINATION WITH -- A BODY

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:09.602
CAMERA AS IT RELATES.

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:11.771
TO OF A YOUNG KID YOUNG BOY A

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.572
YOUNG GIRL -- PERSON WHO IS

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.274
MISSING.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.977
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:19.345
WOULD YOU WOULD.

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:21.347
CONSIDER A BLANKET BAN WHEN THEY

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:22.848
ARE CLEARLY SOME I THINK

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:25.084
IDENTIFIABLE PERSON UP OF

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:26.452
PURPOSES WITH.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.020
LESS CONTROVERSY I THINK THE

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.822
OTHER THING TO CONSIDER.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.357
IS THAT WHILE THE TECHNOLOGY

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:32.725
ISN'T PERFECT IN PERFECT IT

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.827
HINGES ON TWO THINGS NUMBER

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:35.428
[inaudible]

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:36.929
ONE ARM.

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.431
IMAGE QUALITY AND THEN IT ALSO

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.499
HINGES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:41.967
SOFTWARE WILL AS IMAGE

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.836
TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES BECAUSE

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:45.771
CAMERAS IMPROVE -- YOU'RE GOING

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:48.574
TO GET BETTER OUTCOMES IN AND

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:51.010
MORE FINELY TUNED MATCHES AND

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.978
THEN OBVIOUSLY IF THE SOFTWARE.

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.413
CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.983
AT AN ACCELERATED PACE AS IT HAS --

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.685
THAT IS ALSO GOING TO AGAIN

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:02.121
IMPROVE WHICH WHICH REALLY ALSO

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:03.622
KIND OF UNDERSCORES DO WE REALLY

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:05.825
NEED A BAND NOW OR ARE THERE

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.360
SOME OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:11.230
MIGHT BE ABLE TO REGULATE -- THE

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:13.132
USAGE OF THE TECHNOLOGY OR SET

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.100
SOME STANDARDS IN PLACE THAT THE

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.367
TECHNOLOGY MAYBE NEEDS TO MEET

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:19.672
CERTAIN THRESHOLDS OF ACCURACY.

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:21.540
IN ORDER FOR TO BE CONSIDERED --

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:22.374
USEFUL.

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:24.110
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT NOW

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:25.411
YOU CANNOT USE FACIAL

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:28.114
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.715
TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE TO

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:32.585
MAKE AN ARREST -- SO.

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.453
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING WHAT THE

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.855
USE WOULD BE IS.

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.190
YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE SOME SORT OF

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:40.259
COLD CASE AND WE NEED TO TRY AND

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:43.129
NARROW DOWN WHO WAS AT THE SCENE --

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.330
SO WE CAN HAVE FURTHER

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:48.134
CONVERSATIONS -- BUT THE THOSE

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.602
THESE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:51.537
THAT WE'VE I THINK -- SPOKEN TO

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.105
THE AUTHOR ABOUT WE AGREE IT

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:54.540
SHOULDN'T BE USED TO TRACK

IN THE LOSS OF THAT OFFICER'S

FOOTAGE BACK. TO THE STATION IN

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.517
AN INSTANCE LIKE THAT.

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:07.519
BOMB BUT WHAT SHE WOULD BE

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.555
CONSIDERING AT THAT POINT TIME

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:12.891
IS -- OKAY WILL LET'S USE OUR

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.928

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:17.863
IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO LOOKS

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.498
LIKE OUR LET'S PUT IT OUT ON

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.333
TELEVISION -- LET'S DISTRIBUTED

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.635
TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO

YOU KNOW HAS BEEN VIABLE IN THE

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.642
PAST IN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:33.045
VIABLE -- I THINK WE'VE HAD IN A

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.414
LOT OF DEBATE IN THIS SPACE

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:38.550
ABOUT THE THE ACCURACY OF

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:40.452
EYEWITNESS -- FOOTAGE AND THINGS

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:42.354
OF THAT NATURE SO WE WE REALLY

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:44.523
SEE IT AS JUST KIND OF ANOTHER

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.758
TOOL -- TO HELP US IN THAT

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:48.126
ENDEAVOR AND WITH THAT ANSWER

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:49.528
YOUR QUESTION IF I MAY THAT BUT

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:50.896
THAT'S WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.031
FACIAL NECESSARILY YOU HAVE A

00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:54.633
PHOTOGRAPH OF SOMEONE YOU HAVE A

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.834
PHOTOGRAPH OF AND THAT'S NOT

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:58.570
WHAT'S AT ISSUE HERE AND IS IT.

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.405
IT IS IN MY WAY CORRECT THAT.

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:02.241
THAT THAT CONTINUES BECAUSE

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.642
YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING A RECORD OF

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:07.613
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT TO USE

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:08.413
THE BIOMETRIC.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.716
IS THE ISSUE -- AND I'M NOT SURE

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.551
THAT THAT IS PERSUASIVE AS TO

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:15.187
WHY WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:18.090
EXCEPTIONS TO THIS I'M LOOKING --

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:20.058
FOR IF I MAY.

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:20.993
THERE MAY BE A VERY GOOD REASON

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:21.426
[inaudible]

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.462
SUGAR MEANT.

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:27.232
GOOD SOLID OF POLICE OF PURPOSE

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:29.401
IN USING BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:30.869
SYSTEMS WHAT I'VE HEARD IS RIGHT

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.372
NOW THEY'RE NOT THERE BECAUSE

00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:34.039
THEY'RE INACCURATE.

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:37.309
AND TROUBLESOME AS FAR AS WHAT

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:39.177
THE LIMITATIONS WOULD BE.

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.512
SO I'M TRYING TO SEE ARE THERE

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:42.514
ARE INSTANCES GOING FORWARD

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:43.115
WHERE.

00:19:43.181 --> 00:19:45.250
THIS REALLY MAY BE A VALUABLE

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:47.219
TOOL AND THAT WE MIGHT NOT WANT

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:49.421
TO CHOOSE UNIVERSALLY BAN IT.

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:52.257

THAT'S WHAT THAT'S MY QUANDARY

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.202
AT THE MOMENT RIGHT YEAH I I

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:06.038

MINIMIZING THOSE THE TYPES OF

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:18.303
COME DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVELS IN

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:19.804

KEPT AT THE STATE FACILITIES AND

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.478
I THINK FROM THAT CULTURE NOW IS

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:31.149
WENT INTO THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:33.451
CUSTARD FOR SALUTE PLEASE

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:33.751
[inaudible]

00:32:33.818 --> 00:32:35.687
SENATOR MITCHELL.

THANK YOU ARE YOU THINK IN

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.857

PEOPLE ARE TREATED LIKE ANIMALS

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:44.529
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN ANIMAL

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:49.734
LIKE CONDITIONS -- WHEN WE JUST

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.370
CAME FROM THE -- DISPLAY OUTSIDE

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.839
WHERE YOU LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE WHO

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:56.140
ARE LOCKED THAT MAY NOT HAVE

00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:56.541
HOPE.

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:58.276
IN TERMS OF OUR EXTENDED

00:32:58.343 --> 00:33:00.011
SENTENCES.

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.379
ALL THAT WE HAVE PILED ON TO

00:33:01.446 --> 00:33:03.848
THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED --

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:05.950
WHILE I WAS HAPPY TO MOVE THE

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:07.251
BILL I THINK IT'S AT A POOR

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.620
PRACTICE -- TO GO TO YOUR

00:33:09.687 --> 00:33:11.122
QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO WE GET

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.357
THERE WHEN I LOOK AT THE

00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:14.225
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE HAVE

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:15.660
SANCTION THE PEOPLE LIVE.

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:17.095
IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:19.731
TRAGIC BUT NOT SURPRISING MENTAL

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:22.133
I THINK OUR WORK TO TREAT PEOPLE

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.601
LIKE HUMAN BEINGS IN ADDITION TO

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:25.436
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS WILL BE

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.338
HELPFUL.

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:28.673
SENATOR JACKSON YOU KNOW I I

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.842
THINK THAT WAS WHAT I WAS TRYING

00:33:30.908 --> 00:33:32.276
TO GET AT HIS SET.

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:33.611
I DON'T KNOW TWENTY MOTHERS OR

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.079
FATHERS TO TEACH THEIR CHILDREN

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:37.048
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR SO HOW

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:38.049
DOES HE GET TO THE POINT WHERE

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:39.684
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BEHAVE THAT

00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:41.486
WAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:42.620
THAT THAT.

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:43.788
BE SOMETHING WE LOOK AT AS WELL

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:44.956
BECAUSE I DON'T.

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:46.724
I DON'T THINK THAT IS CALLING ON

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:50.128
PEOPLE TO BE THEIR BEST AND TO

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:52.463
BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'LL

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.232
HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND INCIDENTS

00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:55.066
OF THAT IN THE LA COUNTY JAIL

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:55.767

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.135
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE

00:33:57.201 --> 00:34:02.540
WAY WERE CONDUCTING -- ARE --

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:03.541
INCARCERATIONS SYSTEM AND SO I

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:04.575
HOPE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.544
WILL BE LOOKED AT AS WELL INTO.

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:08.045

PERSONAL ISSUE IN TERMS OF ITS

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:56.626
IMPACT IN A FAMILY HERE IN

SACRAMENTO -- BUT I AM CONCERNED

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:00.697
ABOUT THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE

OPPOSITION -- ACCURACY AND

00:55:03.566 --> 00:55:05.201
CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.169
WITH REGARD TO DEATH

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:07.170
CERTIFICATES IS CRITICALLY

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:08.171
IMPORTANT FOR A VARIETY OF

00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:10.507
REASONS IN TERMS OF A RECORD

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.042
KEEPING AND DOCUMENTATION.

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:13.777
AND SOUL HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:15.578
SOME OF THE ISSUES TECHNOLOGY

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:19.983
THAT -- IT'S NOT BEEN DEFINED --

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.185
BEYOND WHAT YOU'RE TO BE DOING

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:23.787
STATUTES AGAIN IS IT AND IT DO

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:24.988
YOU THINK THAT DEFINING STATUTE

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:26.723
IS THE APPROPRIATE FIRST STEP TO

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:27.724
THE IMPACT.

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.893
THE TRIGGER THE PROCESS SEES

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:32.595
THAT THE OPPONENT IS SUGGESTED

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:33.763
NEED TO TAKE PLACE.

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.566
WELL I THINK OF FIRST OPPOSITION

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:37.634
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:39.269
MEDICAL EXAMINERS FOR THE

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.438
NATIONAL BODY WAS SUPPORTIVE OF

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:42.572
THE RECOGNITION OF THIS IN

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:44.574
FEDERAL STATUTE.

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:45.442
IN.

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:46.509
TWENTY FOURTEEN I DON'T THINK

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:47.577
ANYONE WOULD ASSERT THAT TO SAY

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.646
IT IS SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:52.449
IN CHILDHOOD IS ITSELF AN

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:54.517
EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSE OF

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:55.819
DEATH.

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:56.553
THE SO I DON'T THINK IT ACTUALLY

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:59.589
ISN'T I I JUST IT IT DOES NOT.

00:55:59.656 --> 00:56:01.424
IT DOESN'T SPECIFY WHAT WAS THE

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:04.494
MECHANISM -- THE BIOLOGY THE

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.629
MECHANICS THAT PRODUCED THE

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:07.297
DEATH.

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:07.764
SO I DON'T THINK IT IS

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:10.767
EXPLANATORY OF CAUSE OF DEATH.

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:13.903
THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS ACTUALLY.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.472
TO ENSURE THAT AS WE DO A SUDDEN

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.373
INFANT DEATH.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.275
THE PARENTS ARE ALERTED TO THE

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:19.876
IMPORTANCE OF TAKING A TISSUE

YOUR LIFE IS NORMAL.

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:30.086
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:32.422
YOUR CHILD IS NEVER GONNA COME

00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:34.257

00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:51.808
DANGEROUSLY GOES BEYOND THAT

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.443
FIRST IMPORTANT STEP AND I DON'T

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.712
BELIEVE IT DOES DO THAT I DON'T

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:56.479
BELIEVE IT.

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:58.982
FORCES A CATEGORY OF EXPLANATION

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.250

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:11.034
RESOLUTION WOULD BE COMMENDABLE

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.368
TO KIND OF SPUR THAT WORK.

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:13.703
THIS IS ON THE ISSUE OF CAN WE

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.138
ESTABLISH A ROUTINE IN

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.439
CALIFORNIA WHEN THIS FACT

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.508
PATTERN SHOWS UP.

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:20.943
THAT PARENTS WHO ARE IN TRAUMA

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.246
TO A PARTY I DO THINK WE KNOW

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.981
WHAT THEY ARE THE BILL DOES I

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:28.217
THINK WE TO FOR QUESTIONS WITH.

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:28.785
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IN YOUR

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.621
MORAL.

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.923
OKAY SO -- WHEN SECOND BEFORE

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.224
CALLING SENATOR JACKSON I JUST

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.393
WANNA MAKE ONE QUICK EXPLANATION

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.529
SO THE -- OUR COMMITTEE

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:41.264
CONSULTANTSTO ANALYZE THE BILL

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.366
WE OF COURSE I NOTED IMMEDIATELY

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:46.002
THAT THIS BILL WOULD BEEN VETOED.

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.602
A IDENTICAL BILL IT'S BEEN

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.204
VETOED TWICE AND SO I ASKED THE

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:49.372
CONSULTANTS.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:50.740
TO TAKE A VERY GOOD LOOK AT

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:53.476
WHETHER IT DID GO BEYOND --

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.611
CODES AS WAS SUGGESTED BY THE

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:58.114
OPPOSITION AND WHETHER -- IT DID

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.783
AS SIMPLY AS WAS DESCRIBED MAKE

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.119
THE SUGGESTION OF THE TISSUE

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.388
SAMPLES AND IF YOU AND NOTE ON

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:07.523
PAGE TWO OF THE ACTUAL TEXT OF

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.459
THE BILL.

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:10.393
AND YOU READ IT SERVICE IT'S

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.895
BASICALLY PRETTY SHORT IT DOES

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:15.431
ONLY THAT AND DOES NOT CHANGE

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:16.466
CODES.

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.701
AND SO BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GO

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:20.937
ABOVE AND BEYOND EVEN THOUGH YES

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:23.473
IT HAS BEEN VETOED -- I WAS

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:26.409
WILLING -- TO RECOMMENDING AYE

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:28.544
VOTE ON IT SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:30.480
EXPLAIN THAT AND SENATOR JACKSON

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:31.380
GO AHEAD.

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:36.219
YEAH FOR VERY BRIEFLY -- OF THIS

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:36.819
IS A LIMITED SET OF

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:38.654
CIRCUMSTANCES ONE POINT TWO OUT

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:42.358
OF EVERY -- HUNDRED THOUSAND I

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.326
JUST WONDER THOUGH IF.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:45.294
IT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO GET

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:48.331
THIS INTO CODE BACK IN.

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.465
TWENTY FOURTEEN OF BUT THAT

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:52.969
HASN'T HAPPENED -- I WONDER IF

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.403
BY PASSING THIS BILL AND HAVING

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:55.872
IT SIGNED INTO LAW THAT MIGHT

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:58.808
ALSO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.643
I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THE IF WE

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.945
DO NOTHING THEN NOTHING'S GOING

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:05.581
TO HAPPEN -- SO IT'S ON THAT

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.884
BASIS THAT I I WILL MOVE THE

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.086
BILL AND HOPE THAT WE CAN GET

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:10.553
SOME.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.788
CLARITY IN SOME CLOSURE ON THE

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.490
CONCERNS EXPRESSED HERE I THINK

01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:15.558
THEY'RE LEGITIMATE EVEN IF

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.959
THEY'RE LIMITED.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:17.660
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:19.996
CAUSE ENORMOUS OF PEOPLE IN THE

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.899
WHOLE PROCESS BUT OF THE PERHAPS

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.534
IF WEEK PASSES AND IT BECOMES

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.536
LAW WILL GET THE ATTENTION OF

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:28.404
THOSE WHO CAN CO THIS FAIRLY

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.506
QUICKLY I SUSPECT SO WITH THAT

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.275
AND MOVE THE BILL.

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.376

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:26.635
BASED ON A TORN AND

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.337
DEMONSTRATION THAT WE JUST SAW

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.605
OUR EARLIER THIS MORNING WHICH

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:30.539
IS.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:36.846
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL OF

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:37.379
FORTY FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:39.415
BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND FROM

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:41.650
PEOPLE WHO HAVE.

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.252
ALREADY COMPLETED HER SENTENCE

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.720
IN THE FACT THAT SOMEONE HAS

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.623
BEEN ARRESTED -- DOESN'T

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:49.625
NECESSARILY MEAN THIS IS A

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.527
PATTERN OR SHOULD LEAD TO

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:52.461
UNEMPLOYMENT ARE LOSING THEIR

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:53.262
JOBS SO.

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:56.265
I'M JUST REALLY -- CONCERNED

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.100
HERE AND WHO'S GOING TO BE

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.970
IMPACTED BY THIS AND YEAH SO I

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:07.376
HAVE SOME CONCERNS.

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:08.410
WHAT CONCERNS SENATOR MITCHELL

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.279
HOUSING THEN PERHAPS THE AUTHOR

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.615
AND WITNESS OF APPROPRIATE CAN

01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:14.116
RESPOND GO AHEAD SIR?

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:15.251
THANK YOU I THINK RIGHT CONCERNS

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.186
ARE VERY SIMPLE WHAT TROUBLES ME

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:19.455
IS IN THE EXAMPLES YOU GAVE YOU

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.090
TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:22.124
CHARGED.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:23.659
AND WE ALL ARE CLEAR THAT AN

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:24.894
ARREST.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.529
SO WILL BE IN CHARGE AND A

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.697
CONVICTION ARE THREE DIFFERENT

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:31.066
SENT OUT ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:32.268
SPECTRUM.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.502
AND SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GO

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.804
ALL THE WAY BACK TO WIN A REST.

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.473
THAT MAY LEAD TO ABSOLUTELY

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.141
NOTHING.

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:42.411
MAY LEAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:46.115
GIVES ME GREAT CONCERN -- YOU

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:48.150
SAID SOMEONE HAD BEEN CHARGED

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:49.485
WITH THE NEXT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.487
HE DID NOT SAY WHETHER NOT DID

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:52.154
BEEN CONVICTED.

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:54.623
BUT A THE REST AND A CHARGE YOU

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:55.624
TO SEPARATE STEPS.

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.092
AND SO IF YOUR BILL TALK ABOUT

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:58.928
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CHARGED WITH

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.162
CERTAIN CRIMES I MIGHT FEEL

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:02.231
DIFFERENTLY BUT WHEN YOU

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:05.568
CONSIDER -- THE NUMBER OF

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:07.369
ARRESTS THAT OCCUR ACROSS THE

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:09.238
STATE THAT LEAD TO NO FURTHER

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:11.273
ACTION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.042
IT'S ALARMING THAT AS WE HAVE

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:15.511
WORKED FOR YEARS AROUND THE

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:16.879
ISSUE OF BAND BOB BAN THE BOX

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.547
THAT WE WOULD TAKE A STEP

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:21.717
BACKWARDS QUITE FRANKLY. TO OPEN

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:24.553
THIS UP -- TO ARREST THAT YOU

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.454
DON'T EVEN.

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:28.524
NEARLY DEFINE ARRESTS FOR WHAT.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.025
I COULD BE ARRESTED FOR GAVE

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:32.528
ENGAGE IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.463
MANY OF US HAVE -- WHICH SHOULD

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:37.132
HAVE NO BEARING ON MY ABILITY TO

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.335
TO PERFORM ANY PROFESSIONAL

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:39.602
FUNCTION.

01:10:39.668 --> 01:10:40.536
SO FOR THOSE REASONS I CAN'T

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:42.204
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I JUST

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:43.906
THINK IT'S YOU'VE PAINTED TOO

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:50.946
BROAD A BRUSH.

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.514
ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRATION WOULD YOU

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.184
LIKE TO RESPOND AND YOU CAN ALSO

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:58.954
HAVE YOUR WITNESS EXCUSE.

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:00.789
I THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.424
CLARIFY THAT.

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:05.427
THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPACT ALL OF

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:07.496
THE LABOR CODE THAT'S IN THIS

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.365
BILL FOR THIRTY SEVEN STANDS AT

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:11.800
IT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW WE ARE

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.268
JUST NARAL LEAD.

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:14.603
ON TALKING ABOUT CRIMINAL

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.205
JUSTICE AGENCY AND WITHIN THE

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:18.073
CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY WE ARE

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:21.210
NARROWLY FOCUSING ON THOSE NON

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:22.845
SWORN EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE.

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:24.446
VERY PRETTY [inaudible]

EVIDENCE AND DO FORENSIC WORK.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.387
THAT THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.756
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT NOTHING

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.691
IN THE BILL WOULD AFFECT ANYONE

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.459

OR WHO IS CURRENTLY EMPLOYED IN

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:42.665
ANY POSITION.

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:44.366
THIS IS A CLARIFICATION IT WOULD

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:45.601
AFFECT SOMEONE APPLYING FOR THE

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.603
JOB IF THEY ARE IN THE CATEGORY

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.405

EXIST WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:11:58.313 --> 01:11:59.948
ACCESS TO ARREST RECORDS.

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.650
THAT ALREADY IS UNDER CURRENT

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:04.119
LAW WE'RE NOT CHANGING THAT.

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.255
SO IF THEIR SWORN OFFICER BUT

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:07.523

THAT'S ALSO IN THIS CATEGORY

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:12.728
THERE ARE SOME NORRIS NON SWORN

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.496
EMPLOYEES OR APPLICANTS.

01:12:14.563 --> 01:12:18.434
YES APPLICANTS FOR NON SWORN

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.702

THEY'RE HIRED IS THE PROBLEM

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:26.075
THEN WE CANNOT GO BACK.

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:27.142
I'M NOT THAT WE GO BACK THAT IF

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:29.011
SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN WE ARE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.979
NOT ABLE TO DO IT.

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:34.083
IS UNDER THIRTY ONE A ONE

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.885
SENATOR MITCHELL AND SO -- SINCE

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:40.656
IT'S BEEN SO NARROWLY DEFINED AS

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.357
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED -- WHY NOT

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:43.826
DIDN'T NEARLY TO FIND THE NATURE

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:46.729
OF THE ARREST?

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.363
WE'RE CERTAINLY WE'RE HAPPY TO

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:52.534
LOOK INTO THAT.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:53.469
SIMILAR GRAYSON TO JOIN AT

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:54.603
SOMETHING.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.705
I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT -- AS

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.474
WAS ALREADY STATED THAT IT

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.809
ALREADY EXIST TO BE ABLE TO PULL

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:01.877
ARREST RECORDS FOR THOSE THAT

01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:03.345
ARE APPLY.

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:05.047
IT'S ONCE THEY'VE BEEN HIRED FOR

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.583
NON SWORN EMPLOYEES.

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:08.817
AND THOUGH THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.619
BILL IS TO ACTUALLY BUILD A

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:13.055
BRIDGE OF TRUST BETWEEN A PUBLIC

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:15.657
SAFETY AGENCY AND THE COMMUNITY.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:18.660
TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.395
I SEE YOUR REACTION -- BUT TO BE

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.030
ABLE TO SEE WELL TO BE ABLE TO

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:24.466
SAY THAT -- IF WE HAVE SOMEONE

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:27.402
IN A SENSITIVE -- POSITION THAT

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:30.472
IS DIRECTLY RELATED -- TO THE

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:31.473
ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE OF THE

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.741
COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE OR

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:34.943
PROPERTY OR DIRECTLY RELATED TO

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.845
SUCH ACTIVITIES AS APPREHENSION

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.914
PROSECUTION ADJUDICATION

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:41.150
INCARCERATION CORRECTION OF

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:42.885
CRIMINAL OFFENDERS OR COLLECTION

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:44.787
STORAGE DISSEMINATION.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:46.321
OF USAGE OF CRIMINAL OFFENDER

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.423
RECORD INFORMATION THAT IF

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.492
SOMEONE IS ARRESTED THAT THAT

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:52.628
AGENCY CAN LOOK INTO THAT BUT

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:53.695
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT AFFECTS

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.030
THEIR EMPLOYMENT.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.398
IT JUST SIMPLY MEANS THAT THERE

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:58.400
IS AN AWARENESS THAT -- THE

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:02.304
AGENCY HAS TAKEN TO BE ABLE TO

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.206
LOOK INTO IT AND INVESTIGATE --

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:07.409
NO DECISION IS MADE EVERYBODY IS

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:09.444
ABSOLUTELY -- WORTHY OF DUE

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.113
PROCESS AND JUST BECAUSE THERE

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.614
WAS AN ARREST DOESN'T MEAN THERE

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:14.616
MAY BE IT MAY BE A CONVICTION

01:14:14.683 --> 01:14:15.717
MAY NOT.

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.386
BUT JUST SO THAT THE AGENCY THAT

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:18.821
THEY'RE WORKING FOR BECAUSE OF

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.556
THE SENSITIVITY OF THEIR

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:23.458
POSITION THE AGENCY CAN ALSO BE

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.894
ABLE TO STATE THAT THEY AS WELL

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:26.895
ARE AWARE.

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.631
AND ARE TAKING MEASURES TO LOOK

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:30.599
INTO IT.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:34.570
DARKNESS OF THE NATURE OF THE

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:34.803
ARREST.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:35.938
WELL I I THINK THAT WAS

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:37.005
SOMETHING THAT -- THE OUR

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.106
WITNESSES ALSO STATED WE WOULD

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:39.474
DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED IN

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:41.743
LOOKING INTO -- YOUR CONCERN

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:45.581
THERE ABSOLUTELY.

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:48.383
I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IF THE

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:50.118
PERSONS THAT WHOM YOU WOULD BE

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:52.487
EXPANDING ITS TO WORK TO BE

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:53.188
CONVICTED.

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:55.457
THE EMPLOYER WOULD BE NOTIFIED.

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:58.193
SO THIS IS SOLELY ON AN ARREST

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.962
IN OUR ASSUMPTION IS THAT

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:02.531
WHETHER ARRESTED OR NOT ONE IS

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:03.432
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:04.533
ABSOLUTELY.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.535
IT'S IT IS TROUBLING I HADN'T

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.270
THOUGHT ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.671
ASPECTS THAT.

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.440
GUEST -- EMERGED IN THIS

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:13.909
CONVERSATION THAT.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:15.611
IN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A GREAT

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:18.647
DEAL OF BIAS. FOR EXAMPLE

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:21.250
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN -- LOTS OF

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:23.385
RESEARCH THAT SHOWS IT WHEN YOU

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.487
WALK INTO THE COURTROOM.

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:29.091
IF YOU ARE THE INDIVIDUAL YOU

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.994
KNOW BEING TRIED IF YOU ARE IN

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.996
STREET CLOTHES.

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:36.765
MEANING IF YOU'RE NOT IN SAY AN

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:39.328
THAT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:40.228
NINE DEAD.

01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:41.763
LADY THE CATEGORY OF THINGS ONE

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:43.770
THE NATION AND I'D LIKE TO ADD

01:55:43.836 --> 01:55:45.438
BECAUSE I KNOW THE OPPOSITION

ON CRIME AND THREE STRIKES.

01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:51.477
THAT OVER HALF OUR GUN DEATHS

01:55:51.544 --> 01:55:53.546
ARE BY SUICIDE.

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:56.049

WELL AND THAT'S NOT A CRIMINAL

01:56:03.656 --> 01:56:06.959

IT'S PUT TOGETHER BY -- OUR

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:14.387
ATTORNEYS AND IT'S MORE THAN SIX

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:18.157

CODE SECTIONS BEING A GUN OWNER

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:24.697
CALIFORNIA'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:58:24.764 --> 01:58:26.165
THERE'S A LOT TO KNOW.

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:28.401
THE LAWS ARE VERY CONFUSING AND

01:58:28.468 --> 01:58:30.403
THEIR EVER CHANGING EACH YEAR WE

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:33.239
DEAL WITH DOZENS UPON DOZENS OF

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:35.241

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:37.910
SUMMER NOT -- AND THIS BOOK IS

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:39.712
HAS BEEN UPDATED ANNUALLY FOR

01:58:39.779 --> 01:58:40.613
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.448
AND WE HAVE [inaudible]

01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:43.716
JUST.

01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:46.018
THERE'S JUST A LOT TO REMEMBER

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:47.487
AS A GUN OWNER AND YOU COULD.

01:58:47.553 --> 01:58:50.389
CONSTANTLY AT RISK OF OF OF

01:58:50.456 --> 01:58:52.592
LOSING YOUR RIGHTS BECAUSE OF AN

01:58:52.658 --> 01:58:54.760
INFRACTION TO ONE OF THESE LAWS --

01:58:54.827 --> 01:58:55.394
WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL BILLS

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:57.230
INCLUDING A TRANSPORTATION BILL

01:58:57.296 --> 01:58:58.297
IN THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS

01:58:58.364 --> 01:59:00.032
YEAR THAT COULD RESULT IN A FIVE

01:59:00.099 --> 01:59:03.169
YEAR PROBATION -- WITH WITH SOME

01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:04.470
OF THE LAWS I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:59:04.537 --> 01:59:06.539
THE INTENTION BEHIND AMMAR THEIR

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:08.140
THEIR WELL INTENDED AND THEY'VE --

01:59:08.207 --> 01:59:09.842
FOCUS MORE ON THE INSTRUMENT

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:13.145
RATHER THAN THE BAD ACTORS AND

01:59:13.212 --> 01:59:14.247
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S

01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:16.582
MISGUIDED WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:59:16.649 --> 01:59:18.584
THOSE WHO ARE ABUSING OUR LAWS --

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:19.852
WE HAVE A HUGE BACKLOG ON THE

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:21.287
APP SYSTEM WE'VE THROWN MILLIONS

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:22.121
OF DOLLARS THAT THAT WE NEED TO

01:59:22.188 --> 01:59:23.656
REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE

01:59:23.723 --> 01:59:24.824
PROHIBITED.

01:59:24.891 --> 01:59:26.993
THOSE WHO ARE OUT THERE MISS

01:59:27.059 --> 01:59:28.761
USING FIREARMS -- ONE THING I

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:30.296
WANTED TO TOUCH ON LAST WEEK

01:59:30.363 --> 01:59:30.897
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION THIS

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:34.467
COMMITTEE -- ON ACTUALLY -- A

01:59:34.534 --> 01:59:37.537
BILL -- ON DAY SEEKING AND

01:59:37.603 --> 01:59:39.105
ROSTER AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

01:59:39.171 --> 01:59:40.840
THERE'S SEVERAL TIMES WE SEEN

01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:41.674
EXEMPTIONS THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:42.875
EXEMPTS CERTAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:59:42.942 --> 01:59:44.810
AGENCIES FROM HAVING TO USE

01:59:44.877 --> 01:59:45.978
ROSTERED AND GUNS AND I THINK

01:59:46.045 --> 01:59:47.713
THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ON ON

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:49.682
THAT BILL -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

01:59:49.749 --> 01:59:50.650
NOT HAD A NEW MODEL

01:59:50.716 --> 01:59:53.686
SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARM ADDEDTO

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:56.455
THE THE SAFE HANDGUN ROSTER

01:59:56.522 --> 01:59:57.023
SINCE.

01:59:57.089 --> 01:59:58.024
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BECAUSE THE

01:59:58.090 --> 01:59:59.659
STANDARDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET.

01:59:59.725 --> 02:00:01.327
AND AND THAT JUST GOES ALONG

02:00:01.394 --> 02:00:03.262
WITH THE LAWSUIT SO GUN OWNERS

02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:04.797
ARE ARE NOT.

02:00:04.864 --> 02:00:05.831
OF A THIRD THERE CERTAIN THINGS

02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:06.999
THAT ARE JUST BEING BANNED

02:00:07.066 --> 02:00:08.701
BECAUSE OF OUR LAWS THAT ARE

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.703
WELL MADE WHILE THE UNDERLYING

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:13.139
LONG MAY BE WELL INTENTIONED --

02:00:13.205 --> 02:00:14.173
TO TO GO AFTER CERTAIN GUNS WERE

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:15.808
WERE NOT ABLE TO PURCHASE THE

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:17.410
LATEST AND MOST RELIABLE AND

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:18.578
SAFEMODELS.

02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:19.946
AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:21.347
THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFIT

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:22.915
TO THAT WHEN WERE EXEMPTING LAW

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:24.951
ENFORCEMENT -- BECAUSE THEY

02:00:25.017 --> 02:00:26.485
CAN'T GET THOSE MODELS AS WELL

02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:27.954
AND SO -- I'M HAPPY TO TO

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:29.488
DISCUSS THAT BILL AT ANOTHER

02:00:29.555 --> 02:00:30.723
TIME I KNOW THAT'S NOT

02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:33.359
APPROPRIATE FOR NOW -- BUT BUT

02:00:33.426 --> 02:00:34.560
THE LAWS ARE ARDUOUS ON ONE LAW

02:00:34.627 --> 02:00:36.429
ABIDING CITIZENS WE NEED TO

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:38.230
FOCUS ON THE CRIMINAL MISUSE.

02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:39.732
I MEAN THERE'S PLENTY LAWS ON

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:40.800
