00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.388
ARBITRATION AS A WAY TO ENSURE

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:18.923
THAT THOSE WORKERS DON'T EVEN

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:20.858
HAVE THEIR DAY IN ARBITRATION SO

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:23.360
WHAT USED TO BE USED AS A WAY TO

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.362
AVOID -- AT

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:27.264
TRUE SCRUTINY FOR THE EMPLOYER

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:29.333
THERE NOW JUST SIMPLY REFUSING

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.901
TO EVEN ENGAGE IN OR THEY DON'T

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:32.803
ENGAGE IN TIMELY ARBITRATION SO.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.271
THAT WE WE WE SEE KIND OF THE

00:39:34.338 --> 00:39:37.908
DOWNWARD SPIRAL ON WHERE EVEN --

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.510
WORKERS AT GOOGLE HAVE FORCED

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.145
THE COMPANY TO STOP USING THESE

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:43.247
AGREEMENTS I I THINK THE WORLD

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:44.882
IS CHANGING AS WE SEE IT AND I

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:46.183
THINK IT'S TIME --

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.252
THAT THIS BILL IS PASSED AND

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:49.854
SIGNED WE DO HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.288
AND SO WERE WHO WERE HELPFUL FOR

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:52.723
A FRESH SET OF EYES ON THIS

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:55.693
ISSUE -- I I

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.161
JUST WITH THAT HI --

00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.295
I WOULD THERE WAS ONE THING I

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:00.231
THINK WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT WAS

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:01.799
THE MOST COMPELLING REASON.

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:04.435
WHY AT ARBITRATION CANNOT?

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:06.337
REALLY SATISFY --

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:07.671
A WORKERS CLAIMS.

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:08.939
AND I WAS VERY I WAS SHOCKED BY

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.674
THIS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:11.609
SO.

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:12.676

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.249
IF THE ARBITRATOR GETS THE WALL

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:19.884
WRONG IF THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.519
WRONG THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:22.853
TO APPEAL THAT.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.688

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:29.493
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.228
AND I THINK IN OUR JUSTICE

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:32.630
SYSTEM IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT THE

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:35.032

THEY EMPLOYEES OR MOTIVATION TO

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.197
IN THE WORKPLACE THEN THEY CAN

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:42.665
ACTUALLY ACT TO CORRECT IT.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.167

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.068

THE LIABILITY PURPOSES WELL.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.577
AND LAST YEAR THIS BILL --

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:55.778

AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY MINUTES THE

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:59.015
GOVERNOR'S DESK AND HE VETOED

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.583

DISCRIMINATION THE WORKPLACE

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:04.420

HAVE THEIR COMPLAINTS

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:05.855
INVESTIGATED.

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:06.989
I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THE

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:08.324
CURRENT FILING DEADLINE WHICH IS

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.159

MEMORIES IN EVIDENCE ARE FRESH

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:15.565

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.167
REPORTED.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.702
AND SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN IS

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:20.603
THAT THIS COULD CONTINUE TO GO

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.438
ON AN OF PLACES THE CONCERNS OF

HARASSED IF NO ONE'S MADE AWARE

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:29.078
OF WHAT'S OCCURRING --

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:30.313
AND ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSED

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:31.948
SUCH A LIMITATION TO SIX TIMES

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.850
LONGER THAN THE FEDERAL E. O. C.

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.785
STANDARD THAT'S ONLY A HUNDRED

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:36.719
EIGHTY DAYS THE CURRENT STATURE

STATE'S STANDARD --

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.123
OR THE CURRENT SPECIAL

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.691
IMITATIONS IS DOUBLE THE FEDERAL

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.126
STANDARD THIS WOULD EXTEND TO

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:44.961
SIX TIMES THE FEDERAL STANDARD

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:46.295
AND THREE TIMES A STATE STANDARD

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:47.730
ALSO THE VICTIM DOES HAVE OTHER

AVENUES OF RELIEF NOT ONLY

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.433

TO GO THROUGH WITH THEIR

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:16.832
EMOTIONAL PROCESS IS TO MAKE

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:17.700
SURE THAT --

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:19.568

THE SEEM FIT --

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:25.207
I WOULD ASK MISS RAY AS IF SHE

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.475
WOULD CONSIDER.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.778
NARROWING THE SCOPE OF OF HER

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:32.114
BILL. TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT --

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:32.782
CLAIMS --

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:33.048
MEANING --

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:37.253
I'M OF EXTENDING THE THE STATUE

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.889
OF LIMITATION FROM ONE YEAR TO

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:40.222
TWO YEARS --

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.558
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:43.926
LIMIT THAT SCHOOL TO JUST SEXUAL

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:46.562
HARASSMENT AND AND ANYTHING HAS

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:46.862
TO DO WITH.

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:49.265
OF THAT NATURE.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.267
I DO WANT --

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.102
TO SAY SOMETHING --

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.069
THAT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:55.704
EARLIER THIS BILL MADE IT

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:56.772
THROUGH COMMITTEE THROUGH

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:59.141
APPROPRIATIONS THROUGH THE

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.709
ASSEMBLY THROUGH THE SENATE.

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:02.344
AND GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.879
AND THIS WAS THE FORM.

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:06.282
SO WE HAD TO WE'VE TAKEN A

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:08.751
NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS PREVIOUSLY

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:11.120
AND THIS WAS THE FINAL BILL THAT.

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:13.489
WE AS A BODY BOTH PARTIES HAD

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:15.491
AGREED -- TO

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.493
I THINK THAT THAT THE THE

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.095
LANGUAGE IT'S I WILL CERTAINLY

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.832
TALK TO TO TO THE OPPOSITION

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:25.000
ABOUT THEIR POSITION --

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:26.368
BUT WE HAD.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.904
LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS OF LAST YEAR

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.340
AND ARRIVED AT THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.475
WAS.

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.376
THE BEST FIT THAT WOULD PROVIDE

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.045
TO THE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:38.147
NEEDED --

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:41.283
FOR THE VICTIMS AND THUS WE CAME

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:41.917
UP WITH THE LANGUAGE AS WE HAVE

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:42.952
IT.

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:44.353
IF I CAN ADDRESS THAT --

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.188
THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AT

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.022
COVERS --

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:47.456

DISCRIMINATION OSMAN ALL TYPES

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.295
OF UNPROTECTED CATEGORY SO IT

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.631
WOULD BE A DIFFICULT LIMITATION

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:56.732
TO ONLY LIMIT THE BILL TO SEXUAL

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.367
HARASSMENT BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:08:58.434 --> 01:08:59.668
CLAIMS THAT COME FORWARD.

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:01.337
HAVE INTEREST SEXUALITY WITH

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:02.872
OTHER TYPES OF CLAIMS LIKE AGE

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:07.042
OTHER PROTECTION UNDER UNDER

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:09.044
FIFA SO TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:10.045
THING.

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:13.115

SHORTER TIME SO --

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:21.190
THE BILL PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:22.691
CLAIMS UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT

DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT.

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:53.389
DO NOT COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:54.390
THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:56.625
DEAL WITH MENTALLY ALSO THE FEAR

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:59.128
AND THE HUMILIATION AND ALL THE

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:00.763
OTHER FACTORS THAT PREVENT THEM

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:02.398
FROM COMING FORWARD IT IS NOT A

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:04.099
BILL THAT'S GOING TO DISCOURAGE.

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:05.467
PEOPLE FROM COMING FORWARD THERE

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:07.036
ARE REALITIES AS TO WHY THAT'S

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:10.072
THE CASE AND SO THE FIX IS TO

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:11.774
EXTEND THE STATUTE --

INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE WORKERS

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:54.189
THAT THEY TRY TO ASSERT THAT

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:56.391
SOMEHOW THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.459
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WORKERS

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.974
THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE IF

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.709
THOSE WORKERS DON'T GET PAID IF

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:16.411
THERE ISN'T A SAFE WORKPLACE IF

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:17.646

LONG THAT MAY BE.

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.513
AND WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:39.681
THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES PRIOR

01:28:39.747 --> 01:28:41.282

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:44.152
OPPORTUNITY OUT THERE WHERE YOU

KNOWLEDGE OF THAT AND YOU HIRE

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:54.095
SOMEBODY IN ON THE GOOD FAITH.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:55.396
AND THEN THEY DO SOMETHING

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:57.065
HORRIBLE LIKE THIS IT'S JUST

01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:58.633

EMPLOYER.

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:01.736
ON THAT HIRING AGENCY AND SO I

DO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:04.172
TO SUPPORT THIS BUT IT'S REALLY

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:06.407
VERY SIMPLE THING FOR ME I THINK.

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:07.875
YOU KNOW IF IF THIS BILL TAKES

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:09.043
AMENDMENTS AND IT DOES BECOME SO

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:11.345
EXPANSIVE IT IS VERY SUPPORT.

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:13.214
BUT WE CAN'T HOLD PEOPLE IN MY

01:29:13.281 --> 01:29:15.583
OPINION SMALL BUSINESSES LIABLE

01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:18.920

IS IT THE WORKER THAT'S BEING

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:31.699
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OR THE

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:33.301
EMPLOYER EVEN IF THE CONTRACT

WAS SOMEONE ELSE TO COME ONTO

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.069
THEIR PROPERTY.

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:35.970

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:43.711
DON'T THINK I'LL BE AT ALL I

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:45.012
HOPE AGREE THAT.

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:46.180
AN EMPLOYER IS IN A BETTER

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:47.348
POSITION TO CREATE THAT SAME

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:48.783
ENVIRONMENT AND IF THEY'RE

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:49.751
BRINGING.

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.652
OF FOLKS ONTO THEIR PROPERTY AS

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:52.553
OPPOSED.

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.055
TO HAVING THE VICTIMS BE THE

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:58.793
ONES THAT HAVE TO IN A NOT JUST

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.094
WE DEAL WITH THE THE THE

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:00.895
SUFFERING.

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:03.064
OF BEING VICTIMIZED AND I'LL THE

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.198
THE HORRIBLE THINGS HAVE TO GO

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.266
THROUGH THAT ON TOP OF THAT TO

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:06.601
PUT THE BURDEN ON THEM.

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:09.370
THAT AND GO TO THE PROCESS OF

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:10.671
RAISING ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE

01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:12.640
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE EMPLOYER

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:15.910
THAT'S CONTRACTING --

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:17.145
Và DOESN'T HAVE THE THE THE

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:20.181
SAME KIND OF LIABILITY I THINK

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:20.982
THAT THAT.

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:22.617
PRESSURE FROM THE LIABILITY WELL

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.886
CLASS ACTION AND CAUSE MUCH MORE

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:26.721
OVER KEEN OVERSIGHT AND THERE

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:27.922
SHOULD BE OVERSIGHT IF YOU'RE

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:28.823
NOT A CONTRACT OUT.

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.124
CERTAIN SERVICES A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:31.659
ON YOUR PROPERTY --

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:32.860

YOUR PROPERTY SAFE AT ALL TIMES

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:37.498
AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WHY

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:39.333
SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK THAT.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.135
THE ONUS SHOULD BE ON THE THOSE

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.870
THAT ARE IN POWER TO MAKE THE

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:44.138
CHANGES AND MAKE THE COULD MAKE

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:45.640
THE ENVIRONMENT SAFE.

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:47.775
AND NOT ON THOSE THAT ARE BEING

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:50.077
VICTIMIZED AT THE LEE

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.112
ENVIRONMENTS.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:52.847
AND SO FOR THAT FOR THAT REASON

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:54.348
THAT RECOGNITION WHICH HAS NINE

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:56.317
FEET IN OUR TO GUESS IT.

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:58.586
AND IF ANY IF THERE'S NOTHING

01:30:58.653 --> 01:30:59.520
ELSE WILL TURN BACK DECEMBER

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:00.288
GONZALEZ.

01:31:00.354 --> 01:31:01.823
SO -- I

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.658
APPRECIATE THAT.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.126
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORA AND I

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:06.794
UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE QUITE

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:08.062
HONEST I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS IN A

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.764
SMALL BUSINESS CAPACITY BECAUSE

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:10.998
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKERS WERE

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:11.899
ON YOUR PROPERTY UNDER YOUR

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:13.000
CONTROL --

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:15.002
SO IT'S AYE AYE.

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:17.972
WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY THAT OFF

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:19.440
Q. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.509
WHAT HOW THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:22.610
IN THE WORKPLACE --

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:24.278
I I THINK THAT MAYBE THERE'S A

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:25.680
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON ON

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:26.347
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE WE

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:27.248
TALK ABOUT.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:28.749
LARGELY STAFFING AGENCIES YOU

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:30.484
KNOW WHO COME AND AND AND THOSE

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:31.986
WORKERS ARE UNDER THE CONTROL

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:34.222
AND ON THE LOCATION OF THE I WAS

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.990
ON THE MASTER EMPLOYER WHICH IS

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:37.024
KIND OF OFFENSIVE.

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:38.426
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE EMPLOYER

01:31:38.492 --> 01:31:41.362
CONTRACTOR --

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:43.464
SO I I I I I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:44.699
CONCERNS I I DON'T THINK THAT

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:46.467
THERE WARRANTED IN THIS IN THIS

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:48.236
ASPECT I WOULD SAY THIS.

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:50.238
IF I WAS CYNICAL I WOULD SUGGEST

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:52.573
THAT THESE BIG COMPANIES ARE --

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.408
TIME AND TIME AGAIN TRYING TO

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:55.810
FIND WAYS TO LESSEN THEIR OWN

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:58.312
LIABILITY FOR THEIR WHAT ARE

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:00.715
ESSENTIALLY THEIR OWN WORKERS.

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:02.216
AND WE'VE SEEN IT.

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:03.918
WITH WAGES WE'VE SEEN IT WITH

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:05.219
WORKERS COMPENSATION WERE SEEN

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:06.888
IT WAS SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SO

01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:07.488
WE DO FEEL LIKE WE'RE PLAYING

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:09.357
WHACK A MOLE YOU KNOW IN TRYING

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:10.324
TO GET EMPLOYERS TAKE THE

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:11.325
RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:13.027
RIGHTFULLY THEIRS THAT WE SAY IS

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:14.395
A STATE SHOULD RIGHTFULLY BE

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:14.629
THEIRS.

NO SECRET IN SPITE OF THE GREAT

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:12.079
STRIDES WE'VE MADE OVER THE PAST

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:13.347
FEW YEARS SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:15.016
WORKPLACE REMAINS A PERVASIVE

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.417
ISSUE ACROSS INDUSTRIES.

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.452
ESTIMATED 25280% WOMEN

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:19.720
EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:21.555
WORKPLACE AND IT'S NO SURPRISE

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:22.556
THOSE NUMBERS GO UP OVER TALK

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:23.624
ABOUT WOMEN COLOR IMMIGRANT

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:26.093
WOMEN AND WOMEN IN LOW WAGE JOBS.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.828
AT THE SAME TIME APPROXIMATELY

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:29.230
60% WORKERS WHO EXPERIENCE

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:30.698
SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE WORKPLACE

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:32.133
NEVER REPORTED.

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:34.201
THE REASON OVERWHELMINGLY CITED

01:34:34.268 --> 01:34:36.003
FOR THIS IS FEAR AND I THINK WE

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.738
HEARD IT EARLIER WITH --

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:39.607
WITH MISS RACES.

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:41.842
AS THAT HURT.

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:43.778
HER WORKER TESTIMONY IT'S FEAR

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.312
OF LOSING YOUR JOB IT'S FEAR OF

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:46.313
LOSING YOUR HOURS IT'S FEAR

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.282
BEING LAID OFF ITS FEAR OF BEING

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:49.183
ABLE SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY FARE

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:51.018
IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES TIED TO

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:52.219
LOSING A JOB.

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:53.788
SO RETALIATION INTAKE FORMS IN

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:56.424
SO MANY WAYS AND OFTEN WOMEN IN

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:58.426
PARTICULAR ARE ON REALLY CHILLED

01:34:58.492 --> 01:35:00.061
FROM FROM ESTABLISHING THE

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:01.095
RIGHTS.

01:35:01.162 --> 01:35:02.129
ALTHOUGH THEIR RIGHTS FOR WOMEN

01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:04.198
WHO CAN HIRE AN ATTORNEY AND SUE

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:05.666

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:06.333
A WOMAN.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.303
TO CHANGE THE SITUATION WITHOUT

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.172
FILING A LAWSUIT --

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:12.840
IS VERY LIMITED IN FACT IT

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:15.376
DOESN'T EXIST AB ONE SEVENTY ONE

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.243
PROTECTS VICTIMS OF WORKPLACE

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:17.344
SEXUAL HARASSMENT SOLVE BY

01:35:17.411 --> 01:35:18.946
GIVING THESE WORKERS THAT SHE'LL

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:19.880
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COME

01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:20.848
FORWARD.

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:24.452
IT WOULD ESTABLISH A REBUTTABLE

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:27.888
PRESUMPTION WITHIN NINETY DAYS

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:29.423
OF EMPLOYERS KNOWLEDGE OF THE

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:30.524
VICTIM STATUS.

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:31.792
I'M SO OF COURSE THE EMPLOYER

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:32.927
WOULD HAVE TO KNOW IN BEEN

01:35:32.993 --> 01:35:34.995
INFORMED A SUPERVISOR WOULD HAVE

01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:37.765
BEEN TOLD THAT THIS HAPPENED AND

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.134
AND THEN NONETHELESS AT CREATED

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:41.502
ACTIONS WHICH PUT THE WORK IN A

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.603
WEBER SPOT.

01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:44.138
THE NUMBER ONE THING WE HEARD WE

01:35:44.205 --> 01:35:45.539
ACTUALLY THIS BILL CAME OUT OF

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:47.208
DOING HEARINGS ACROSS THE STATE

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:48.542
AND WHAT WE HEARD THE MOST WAS --

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:49.710
AS A SITUATION THAT YOU CAN

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.912
IMAGINE A RESTAURANT WHERE A

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:54.515
SERVER OR OR A DISHWASHER GOES

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:55.416
TO TELL --

01:35:55.483 --> 01:35:57.318
HER SUPERVISOR LIKE LOOK THE

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:59.153
COOK IS PENSION MY BAT SERIOUSLY

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:01.555
WAS WHAT WE HEARD MULTIPLE TIMES

01:36:01.622 --> 01:36:02.423
I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH THAT

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:03.124
CC.

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.792
AND THE SUPERVISOR SAID OKAY

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.393
THEN I'M CHANGING YOUR SHIFT.

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:07.895
THAT'S RETALIATION AND AND NO

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:09.497
WOMAN SHOULD HAVE TO FILE A

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:11.298
LAWSUIT IN ORDER TO STOP THAT

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:13.267
BEHAVIOR THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:14.869
FACE THE CONSEQUENCES SOMEBODY

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:16.470
ELSE'S ACTIONS --

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:18.239
THIS WOULD ENSURE ON THAT THEY

01:36:18.305 --> 01:36:19.673
HAD THESE RIGHTS IN THAT IT WAS

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.142
OF COURSE REBUTTABLE I KNOW THE

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.443
OPPOSITION WILL COME AND SAY AS

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:23.811
THEY DID IN THEIR LETTER.

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:24.745
THAT SOMEBODY STOLE FROM THE

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:25.946
WORKPLACE --

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:27.915
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THEY ALSO

A READ THE ALL THIS DOES HAVE TO

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:46.000
ACTUALLY HAVE A REASON TO FIRE

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:47.668
OR TO CHANGE SOMEBODY SCHEDULE

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:49.870
OR TO REDUCE THEIR HOURS THAT

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:50.771
THAT IS --

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:52.239
ARTICULATE YOU CAN ARTICULATED

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:54.608

THANK YOU WITNESS.

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:01.949
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAITLIN

REMINDED THAT THE ASSEMBLY LABOR

COMMITTEE IS THE BEST COMMITTEE

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:11.225
AND THE BUILDING BECAUSE YOU

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:13.861
HEAR THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:14.762
BILLS.

01:37:14.828 --> 01:37:16.597
AND TESTIMONY YOU REALLY GET A

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:17.965
SENSE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.767
WORKER IN CALIFORNIA AND THE

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:21.368
CHALLENGES THAT WORKERS FACE AND

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:22.636
I FEEL LIKE ANY ONE OF THESE

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:24.205
BILLS GIVES YOU A LITTLE PIECE

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:24.638

HEARD TODAY REALLY CREATE A

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:30.110
PORTRAIT OF WHY IT IS SO HARD TO

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:31.946
STOP SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON THE

01:37:32.012 --> 01:37:32.546
JOB.

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:35.849
PARTICULARLY OF LOW WAGE WORKERS.

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:37.351
THIS BILL I BELIEVE IS AT THE

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:39.119
HEART OF SOUL MUCH OF THE

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:40.020
PROBLEM.

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:42.223
WHEN WORKERS REPORT VIOLATIONS

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:44.491
THEY GET RETALIATED AGAINST

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:46.961
ALMOST EVERY TIME HAVING BEEN A

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:49.296
UNION REP HI I AM A LABOR LAWYER

01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:50.864
WHEN YOU TALK TO WORKERS?

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:52.700
EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY REPORT

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.802
VIOLATIONS THERE IS SOME FORM OF

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:57.004
RETALIATION IT IS EXTREMELY

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:59.139
WIDESPREAD AND IT IS THE BIGGEST

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:01.141
REASON THAT WORKERS DON'T REPORT

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:02.109
ABUSE.

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:03.410
WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS IT

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:05.579
WOULD SAY OKAY IF YOU REPORT

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:06.847
THAT YOU ARE SEXUALLY HARASSED

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:08.382
AND THE NEXT DAY OR FIRED OR THE

01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:09.650
NEXT WEEK YOU'RE FIRED OR YOU'RE

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:11.385
PUT ON THE NIGHT SHIFT OR YOU

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:12.152
GET YOUR HOURS CUT?

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:13.487
WORKING ASSUME THERE WAS A

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:14.855
CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:16.590
THINGS NOW IF THE EMPLOYER HAS A

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:18.692
GOOD REASON ALL THEY HAVE TO DO

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:20.027
IS COME AND PRESENT IT.

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:23.163
THE EMPLOYER AS AS I THINK WE'VE

01:41:22.676 --> 01:41:24.244
BILL FOR THE REASONS THAT THE

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:25.546
PROVISIONS ARE CONTAINED IN

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.047
CURRENT LAN THEREFORE NECESSARY

AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:31.318

ALREADY IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:35.055
IN THE LABOR CODE.

THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS REMAIN

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.226
WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:39.827
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:40.761
HOUSING.

01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:44.465
AND A SIMILAR MATTER WE FEEL THE

01:41:44.531 --> 01:41:46.967
SAME THING ABOUT A SEXUAL

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:48.068
HARASSMENT IS MUCH DIFFERENT

01:41:48.135 --> 01:41:49.736
IT'S VERY BROADLY DEFINED IT'S

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:51.038
NOT SEXUAL ASSAULT IT'S NOT

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:52.039
STOCKING.

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:53.040
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE THE

01:41:53.106 --> 01:41:54.675
POLICE ARE USUALLY INVOLVED IT'S

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.210
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS EASILY

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:58.312
IDENTIFIABLE ALL THE TIME IT'S

01:41:58.378 --> 01:42:00.180
LEERING IT'S GESTURES IT'S ALL

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:01.582
SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:03.016
BECOME SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:04.084
SO DETERMINING WHETHER SOMEONE

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.586
IS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:06.587
IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:07.888
DETERMINING SOMEONE WHO IS A

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:09.890
VICTIM OF STALKING SEXUAL

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:10.457
ASSAULT AND ALL THESE OTHER

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:11.625
TYPES OF CRIMES --

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:12.860
AND THANK YOU TO ADDRESS THE

01:42:12.926 --> 01:42:14.761
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT IS A

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:16.029
CONCERN OF OURS --

01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:17.097
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN

01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:18.932
SHIFTING OBVIOUSLY THAT THIS IS

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:19.967
A CLAIM THAT THE EMPLOYEES

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:20.934
BRINGING AND NOW THIS BURDEN

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.836
SHIFTS TO THE EMPLOYER IN ORDER

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:23.770
TO PROVE.

01:42:23.837 --> 01:42:25.172
THAT IT WASN'T A REBUTTABLE

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:26.740
PRESUMPTION AND AND I DO SAY

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.141
THAT THE EXAMPLE THAT'S USED OUR

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:29.843
LETTER WAS A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:30.978
WHEN I WAS LITIGATING THESE

01:42:31.044 --> 01:42:32.079
CASES THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ABOUT

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:33.247
EMPLOYERS THERE'S ALSO ABOUT

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:34.047
EMPLOYEES OUT THERE.

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:35.582
SOMEONE DID FILE FALL SEXUAL

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:36.917
HARASSMENT CLAIM SIMPLY TO COVER

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:37.851
UP THE FACT THAT THEY WERE

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:39.119
STEALING FROM THE COMPANY SO THE

01:42:39.186 --> 01:42:40.854
THINGS UNFORTUNATELY DO HAPPEN

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:43.991
AND THAT'S WHY IT IS A CONCERN

01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:44.791
FOR US.

01:42:44.858 --> 01:42:45.125

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:24.458
THINK THAT WE ALL WANT THE SAME

01:44:24.524 --> 01:44:26.226
THING --

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:26.860
THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT OPINIONS

01:44:26.927 --> 01:44:30.430
AS THAT PUTS YOU BRING THIS BILL

01:44:30.497 --> 01:44:32.232

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:32.966
YOU BOUGHT FOR IT --

01:44:33.033 --> 01:44:34.534
THIS AFTERNOON THE REASON I

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:37.971
AND WE'D LIKE TO CLOSE I WENT

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:39.306
AND I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:40.307
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE

01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:41.208
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT CODE IN

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:42.342
THE LABOR CODE IN THIS IS AN ON

01:44:42.409 --> 01:44:44.077
GOING OBVIOUSLY --

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:46.046
WHEN CONVENIENT THE DISCUSSION

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:47.314
THAT'S BROUGHT UP BY THE CHAMBER

01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:48.482
WHEN WE HAVE THINGS THE LABOR

01:44:48.548 --> 01:44:49.082
BECAUSE OF LONG IN THE LABOR

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:50.384
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THAT AS

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:51.418
WELL BECAUSE?

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:53.320
IT MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO PRAGUE A

01:44:53.387 --> 01:44:54.421
THEY DON'T LIKE LAWSUITS THROUGH

01:44:54.488 --> 01:44:56.189

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:58.358
ALWAYS AN ISSUE.

01:44:58.425 --> 01:44:59.660
BUT I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:00.927
ABOUT WHY WE PUT IT IN THE LABOR

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:02.729
CODE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:05.032
WHO DON'T WANT TO FILE A LAWSUIT.

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:07.200

01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:08.869
CLASS ISSUE GOING ON HERE RIGHT

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.837

THE REALITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:38.699
