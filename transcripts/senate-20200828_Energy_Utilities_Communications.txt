TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. THE NOTION OF SECURITISATION HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT BILL. AND IT'S JUST I JUST FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY AREA WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO SMOOTH OUT APPROPRIATELY SO STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE- SMOOTHED OUT THE CENTER COLLECTION BY UTILIZING THIS MECHANISM. AND HENCE WEATHER'S IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY RISKS AND OR COSTS. TO RATEPAYERS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO UTILIZE THIS MECHANISM. AND I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SOMEONE WITH A CHRISTINE ARE YOU SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS ON THIS MEASURE ON BEHALF OF. THE VARIOUS PARTIES TO TRY TO GET THIS THING THROUGH SENATOR BRADFORD AND HIS STAFF TOGETHER WITH- MISTER CALDERON HIS STAFF MR LIPPER. AND OTHERS BUT THIS WAS A LOT OF WORK BUT IT WAS IT WAS THE RIGHT IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND I WOULD SUGGEST WHETHER IT WAS WHAT WE DID WITH THE ENERGY CRISIS TWENTY YEARS AGO OR- WHETHER WILL PROPOSE IN THE NEXT BILL. THAT IT IS INTELLECTUALLY HONEST TO LOOK AT THIS TOOL. IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT. THAT WE WOULD UTILIZE IN DEALING WITH CRITICAL ISSUES FACING CALIFORNIA AND FACING RATE PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH S. RIVAL. VERY WELL ANYONE ELSE- CENTER WINNER. AND HILL AFTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE A QUESTION HE WOULD BE FOR. A FOR ADDISON AS ONE OF THEM WITNESS SINCE THE AUTHOR MISTER CALDERON IS NOT PRESENT IN THE BILL ITSELF. AND THE QUESTION IS- THE ISSUE IS THAT THE BILL I THINK IS A LITTLE BIT VAGUE ABOUT WHETHER- CCA'S I WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS- THIS KIND OF- OF OUR FINANCIAL MODEL AS WELL. I THINK THEY CERTAINLY SHOULD BE- AND- I WOULD ASK EDISON ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS BILL CAME IN THE PRINCIPALLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE. TO AMANDA- BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT AT A MINIMUM WE COULD HAVE A% LETTER TO THE JOURNAL TO CLARIFY THAT THE INTENT IS TO INCLUDE CCA'S SO MY QUESTION IS TO A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. YES HELLO GENERATORS IN BALBOA- CALIFORNIA SENATE YEAH WE I THINK HAD INDEPENDENCE MANY HEARD TODAY FROM THE REPRESENTED FROM COUNTY CA SOME REALLY GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM ABOUT- HOW THE CUSTOMERS. THAT THEY REPRESENT AND IT REALLY AREN'T WITH I HAVE USED AND SHARED CUSTOMERS THE I USED. TAKE CARE OF THE AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IN THE DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY IN SIX YEARS- YOU KNOW HELP. RETURN THE POWER THERE- THIS IS A- AND OF THIS BILL THE D. IN OUR RACE THAT WOULD TALKING ABOUT. WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WAS SHARE% WITH ALL KINDS WHETHER YOU WERE BY. ON THE HOW DOES HE SEE A- OF POWER OR NOT IF HE- INVESTOR ON YOUR TO INDUSTRY. PRINCIPLE EDITION APART THE PC AND- GRANTED US. THIS ACCORDING ON THEIR CUSTOMERS THEY REPRESENT IN A GIVEN YEAR PERCENT OF SOMEONE SUGGEST. SIDE WE ALL SHARE IN THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROPOSAL I KNOW THERE ARE SOME OTHER- AREAS- YOU KNOW HOW QUICK EDUCATION UTILITY RATEMAKING IS. RATHER INTENSE BUSINESS I THINK HAVING GREAT. CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM TODAY AND WE- DEPLETE THAT. UNDER YEAH. WE'LL CONSIDERING WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON. THANK YOU. TWENTY FIVE YOU FOR I. HONEST I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL TO THAT EXTRA IMPORTANT AND SO IN CALIFORNIA EDISON PLEASE DON'T- DON'T. LET US DOWN- ON THAT WERE THIS IS A HI COMMITTEE IS GONNA BE RECONVENING NEXT YEAR AND I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. THAT CONFIDENCE- THAT- THAT THESE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE IT REALLY SHOULD BE INCLUDED. AND WILL BE WORKING WITH MISTER TO SURE THAT IT IS AN TO- WE HOPE GOT A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL EXPRESSING. OF ALLENTOWN THANK YOU. VERY WELL CENTER. THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN AND I WANT JUST TO STAND AND- OF OUR CITY SUPPORT OF US SENATOR WIENER'S COMMENTS RELATED TO CCA'S AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT AND HOPEFULLY THAT CAN BE. ADDRESSED AND ALSO IN. REFERENCE TO SENATOR HERTZBERG'S. IN HIS OF. COMMENTS AND SUPPORT TO THIS OUTLINING THE BENEFITS OF SECURITIZATION I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN TIMES WHEN THAT IS CRITICAL AND- THE NECESSARY ABOUT I LIKE TO ASK THE OF. THE WITNESS FROM OF THIS YEAR A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF I COULD- ONE IS. IT JUST FOR ME TO GET THE CONTEXT AROUND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL NEED. THAT WERE EXPRESSING TODAY IN THIS IN THIS LEGISLATION- SO IT IT'S YOU KNOW HOW MUCH UNDER COLOR HAVE YOU ACTION. SO FAR THIS YEAR. IN THE PANDEMIC AND IN THAT NOT AN ESTIMATE FOR TWENTY TWENTY TOTALLY WHICH IS FROM JANUARY TO THROUGH AUGUST YOU. YOU HAVE THOSE NUMBERS ARE. YEAH I'M HAPPY TO PASS ALONG THE FIRM NUMBERS- YOU TAKE CARE STAFF AND I THINK THE GENERAL TREND THAT WE'RE SEEING IF WE- YEAH I KIND OF CONSIDER WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR UP TO THIS DATE FOR THE END OF THE YEAR ON THE LOW END. EDITION OKAY- THOSE TO WHAT WE CALL KIND OF AREAS OF UNDER COLLECTION. DECREASING SALES NOW OF THE- YEAH BUILDING QUINCY THAT TURNED TO BAD. WE THINK ON THE END. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PLEASE JUST PRESS ENTER ON SIX ON. MILLION DOLLAR. IN THE YEAR TWENTY THAT WOULD BE. PUT ON TOP OF RATE IN BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE COULD UNDO IT AND THEN ON THE UPPER AND- BUT WE HIS. YOU GUYS ARE YOU KNOW JOHN WITH THIS IN REAL TIME I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH IT ON THE HIGHER END OF THE SPECTRUM. EDITION CUSTOMERS COULD BE FACING. SOMETHING AROUND A BILLION DOLLARS ON THE HIGHER EXTREME THE SUMMER THAT KIND OF WHAT KIND OF THE RANGE. UNDER COLLECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT WOULD BECOME AN ENTREE. INTO TWENTY ONE AND HEARING CENTERS. FOR PER RATE INCREASE. ON THE LOW END. THERE IN TWENTY ONE WORK STATION 7% RAY INCREASE. ON THE HIGHER END. TWENTY ONE SO I UNDERSTAND SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT FROM JANUARY THROUGH AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU'VE HAD A SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- REDUCTION OR REVENUE. IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING. I'M SORRY THAT IT HAPPENED AT THE TOTAL FORECAST BASED ON THE TREND SO FAR- I HAVE TO GET BACK TO ON THE ACTUAL FIGURES WERE WHO WERE LESS THAN THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION NOW- WE HAD SOME PRETTY BAD MONTHS I THINK WE GOT A- WARM NAY WHICH- IS ACTUALLY IT IS NOT. HAVING A COUPLE MORE MONTHS WHEN ELECTRICITY USAGE INCREASES BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE USING THEIR EIGHTEEN HELPS. TO MITIGATE SOME OF THAT. DECLINING SALES. SO THIS IS WHAT I NEED BEFORE CAN BASED ON AND SEEN. SO FAR I CAN GET CALLED AN YOUR ARE ABOUT THE ACTUALS TODAY. WELL I MEAN THE WEATHER'S ARE ONE THING WITH THAT IS AN INDICATOR ROTH OR REFLECT IN TERMS OF THE REVENUE- FROM BUILD. AMOUNTS TO COLLECT THAT AMOUNT WHICH IS THE DISCREPANCY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO SECURITIZED. SO DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER THAT FROM JANUARY TO AUGUST THAT SHOULD REFLECT WHAT YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED FROM YOUR BILLING AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO LAST YEAR'S PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE WE HAD. THIS PROBLEM. YEAH I CAN. I CAN FOLLOW UP DIRECTLY WITH YOUR STAFF WORKING GIVE ME ONE MOMENT I COULD PULL IT UP RIGHT NOW. OKAY. THIS AT ALL CENTER. I'M SORRY- NO WELL. YEAH I AND I DID HEAR MORE COMPLEX HE WAS ACCUSED TRYING TO PULL UP THE NUMBERS. YEAH I KNOW IT ANOTHER QUESTION I CAN ANSWER THAT HOMES. ARE YOU. LOOKING FOR THAT. SORRY YES IT IS HERE GOT IT HERE SO CURRENT TODAY. WHAT I SAID I GOT MEMBERS. FOUR YOU KNOW JUNIOR TODAY WE'RE SITTING SOMEWHERE AROUND THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF UNDER COLLECTION AND I THINK OUR PROJECTION FROM JULY TO DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE LOW END SCENARIO IS ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION SO THAT GETS YOU INTO THE REALM OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE YEAR SO WE'RE ABOUT. TO SEE IN ABOUT HALF OF THAT TREND OKAY ON THE LOW END SO FAR TODAY AND HERE COMPOUND INTEREST SOMEONE DOING THE SAME THING FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND WE MAY BE IN THE SIX. AND YEAH SIX THIRTY FIVE SIX FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR RANGE OF UNDER COLLECTION DRESS FOR AT THE END AND THEN IT NEEDS TRANSCEND CONTINUING ESPECIALLY WITH- THE FUTURE I'M GONNA CONSUMER BUILDING QUINCY AND DAD DAD YEAH THE CREASE IN THE WORLD WE'VE IN THE WAY THE PLEDGE THAT WE WILL NOT BE TURN OFF ANYONE'S POWER. DURING THAT TIME OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP IN THE PANDEMIC OKAY SO WE'RE SITTING IN A PLACE WHERE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE UNABLE PAY. THAT DEBT AND BAD DEBT IS KIND OF NEAT THE APPROVING AND BE MORE AT. THE NEW ABOUT THE WE ARE SEEING IS THAT ONE THING THAT HAPPENED SPECTER MAYBE THAT WILL BILLION SO TODAY ACROSS WHEN I GOT THE NOW. JANUARY TO JUNE IS AROUND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY RIGHT AND I DON'T MY QUITE AND THAT WAS WHEN THEY COME MY QUICK. NOW IS HOW WILL HOW DOES THAT REFER. ON LAST YEAR UNCOLLECTED. REVENUE FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME. I'M TRYING TO GET A COMPARISON WHICH LAST YEAR SO HOW REFER HOW IT HOW IS COVERED REFLECTED IN THIS. NUMBER YEAH KNOW I HAVE TO GO BACK TAKE A LOOK AT ACTUAL THANKS IS. BETWEEN THE TWO I THINK THAT WHEN I CAME HERE HE WAS SORT OF OUR FORECAST RIGHT WHICH IS INFORMED BY THOSE PREVIOUS YEARS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LIKE MONTH BY MONTH IT'S A MONTH WE'RE AROUND 7% UNDER COLLECTED UNDER SOMEONE'S WHERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE LIKE I SAID A WOMAN MONTH MAYBE 2% UNDER COLLECTED THEN WE ONE COVERT REALLY HIT APRIL YOU'RE 14% UNDER COLLECTED VERSUS OUR FORECAST. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL KIND OF BASED OFF OF YOU KNOW WELL FORECAST WHICH IS THE SALES EVERY YEAR AND WE'RE WATCHING YOUR CAR AND DISSIPATING GAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM. OKAY THAT. NUMBER KILOWATT HOUR. AND IT RECEIVED OFF THAT CAPS TO SPEAKING THE STATE. UNDER COLLECTION SERVICE LIKE WHEN KOBE PRINCESS. THE FIRST MONTH EIGHT WHERE TO SACK. ABOUT 14% DECREASE IN THE COLLECTED FROM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT INTO IF I COULD S. SENATE BRADFORD. A QUESTION TO AS AN IN YOU MAY BUT WHY IS THIS DIRECTED ONLY AT ELECT YOU. AND AN APK ADD OR WATER UTILITY KNOWLEDGE SIMILAR. ON MISTER CALDERON CHOI TO. FOCUS ON THE LECTURE BILL I THINK THAT A GREATER. ON ON THE OVERALL UTILITY COST AND WITH THE LOST REVENUES DURING THE COLDER- SITUATION. IN LIGHT OF. RESTAURANTS BUSINESSES IS BEING CLOSED SO THEY'RE VERY DRAMATIC IMPACT IN THAT AREA SO WE VERY WELL PRATICA CAPTURED. WATERING GASES WORLD BUT I THINK THE GREATEST IMPACT HAS BEEN IN A LOT TO CONSTRUCT. I COULD THANK YOU. VERY WELL WILL TO SOME US DALIO QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I GONNA TAKE A SENATOR HILL FOR THEM HE ASKED ONE OF THE QUESTION I WANT TO COMPARISON FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR- THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS- WE HAD BAD DEBT SO LISTS FOR EXAMPLE IS A SAY THAT THERE ARE COMMERCIALS RESTAURANTS OR WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT YOU KNOW BEEN GOING LONG NOT PAYING THEIR BILL AND THEN THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT THAT DEBT YOU CAN'T COLLECT IT IS IT GETS SPREAD ACROSS THE PAYING CUSTOMERS THAT. ARE LEFT IN THE FUTURE. HE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE HIM INTO THE PC YEAH THIS CASE IN PROCESS FOR ASSESSING HOW THAT. BAGHDAD WANT TO TERMS BAD DEBT IS SOCIALIZED ACROSS THE REMAINING CUSTOMER CLASS BUT THAT YES- DAHLE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES AND AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD COME. SOME OF THE COMMENTATORS I'M HONEST A LOT OF THE POST OF THAT OFFER COMMENTS STILL LEAVES MOST OF YOU KNOW ACTUALLY ALL OF THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT COST ALLOCATION HEY DONNA SECURITIZATION TRUE THAT PROBABILITIES. PROCESS AND WE'RE IS NO WAY TRYING TO CHANGE UTILIZED THE SAME. FRAMEWORK FOR FROM IN CAN FOUR AND WE CAN DISCUSS ARE BOUND TO PAY THE HOW TO SOCIAL PUBLIC YOU TO CAN. WHERE HE KNOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW DATA AND DIFFERENT COLOR OF VIEW AND THAT REGULAR AGENCY TRYING TO COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE THAT WORKS. YEAH WELL ONE OF MY- CONCERN IS THAT WE LEAVE IT UP TO THEM YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAD THE- ENERGY CRISIS. BACK IN THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION AND YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE BILLS WERE CUT OFF ON THAT. THE COMMERCIAL USERS MORE THAN THE RESIDENTIAL AND- AND I AM AFRAID IT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT DID YOU KNOW THE RATES REALLY GO OUT BUT NOT AT THE RESIDENTIAL LEVEL- BUT THEY DID SIGNIFICANTLY GO UP ON THOSE- AND I'D- USERS THAT WERE WATER PUMPERS AND FARMERS IN. AND MANUFACTURERS ALIKE SO- I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT LETTING THEM JUST YOU KNOW PICK. SPREADING OUT I WNT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MADE THATARE GETTING THIS. RELIEF RIGHT NOW THAT. IS ADVERTISED OVER TIME THAT THE YOU KNOW HEY IT BACK AND IT DOESN'T GET CAUGHT SHIFTED TO. A SOMEBODY ELSE AND- BECAUSE IF YOU'RE USING THAT YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT ASKED TO- THE BILL SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL A TODAY- BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE TYPE OF GIMMICKS OR OR SCENARIOS WHERE. THE PERSON THAT RAN UP THE BILL. DOESN'T PAY THE BILL AND IT GOES ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE THAT'S NOT FAIR RIGHT. THANK YOU. OKAY WILL MOVE. TO CENTER MORE LIKE DID YOU WANNA. SAY SOMETHING THERE. THANK YOU MEASURE- MAYBE JUST TO RECAP BECAUSE I DID HAVE TO LEAVE FOR A COUPLE SECONDS BECAUSE MY HOT SPOT RAN OUT OF JUICE BUT- IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS A TWO PRONGED CONCERN THE PERSISTENT FACTOR. THE AB ELECTRIC BILLS SO YOU'RE KIND OF USING THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE LEDGER COLLATERAL FOR THE LATE PAYMENTS AND THEN. THE OTHER COMPONENT IS A YOU HAD A DECLINE IN. SALES BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE OF IT OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. AND THOSE TWO HAVE COME TOGETHER AND YOU ARE. SORT OF LIKE THE WATER AGENCIES THAT TOLD US TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WATER WE USE FOUNDER REVENUES DECLINED AND THEN RAISED OUR RATES TO GET BACK UP TO. A CERTAIN LEVEL SO I'M I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS- YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO THE SEE IF YOU SEE BECAUSE OF A FIXED RECOVERY CHARGE SAID AFTER. CREWS. AND THIS. THREE FREES UP. FINANCING WILL SMOOTH IT OUT BUSH THE TIMING IS WE'RE SAYING THAT. THE WHAT THE ELEGANT SOLUTION TO SENATOR HERTZBERG WOULD SAY THE SOCIALIZE THE COSTS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU CAN DO. IF YOU HAVE A RIVER. THE NEW DECLINE IN THE FUTURE WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING TODAY GET READY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT THIS SHOW. YEAH. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION ARMONK AND I'LL I'LL TRY TO ANSWER THIS WAY I THINK. THE UTILITY TAKES A LOT OF PAIN AND REWORKS OF OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES TO TRY AND COME UP WITH FORECAST OF. ELECTRICITY USAGE WE HAVE A YOU KNOW OUR GENERAL RATE CASE WORKS OUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE HAVE A NEW LEAD REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN OUR SYSTEM INVESTED WILDFIRES SYSTEM HARDENING SESSION CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. WE HOW TO HELP WHAT IT'S GONNA COST. AND DO ALL THE THINGS.% YEAH WE NEED TO DO TO OUR SISTER SAFE. AND AFFORDABLE THEN WE KIND OF ASSUME AND FORTY. YEAH USE WE'RE PRETTY GOOD AT IT- YEAH ELLIPTICITY SALES AND THAT'S HOW WE GET TO OUR RATES AREN'T YOU SEE HOW MUCH MONEY WITH YOU SEE AUTHORIZES US TO. GET FROM CUSTOMERS AND WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY KILOWATT HOURS ARE GOING TO GET USE. THAN WE COME UP WITH RATES IN VERY CONCRETE FORMAT THE PROBLEM THERE IS. YOU KNOW WE. DIDN'T FORECAST A CO DEPENDENT. YEAH DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW. I DON'T THINK ANY. IN. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MEASURE. OKAY VERY WELL AND MISSY DO WE HAVE- ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO COMMENT. WELL THERE ARE NO MORE COMMENTS SENATOR BRADFORD DID YOU WANT TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR. DEGREE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE AND I. THEY'RE NOT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MISTER CALDERON BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AS A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. AND STATE THAT. UNDER COLLECTION IS NOT NEW. I JUST THINK THE CURRENT SITUATION HAS EXACERBATED A PROBLEM AND I THINK IT ALSO SPEAKS TO THAT ANTIQUATED. RATEMAKING SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS AS IT RELATES TO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. AND THE P. YOU SEE. AND THAT I WOULD DEFEND THE FACT THAT. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AT A FAR HIGHER BURDEN. AND POWER DELIVERY VENICE CCA ALL CCA DOES ACQUIRE THE POWER BUT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES RESPONSE FOR DELIVERING POWER READ THE METER DOING THE BILLING AND THOSE COSTS ARE PART OF THOSE STRANDED COSTS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO RECOVER SO. IT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND THEIR CORN IN THE PURCHASING OF POWER BUT IT'S THAT ACTUAL DELIVERY OF THOSE POWER THE MAINTAINING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN FACTORED IN AND THEIR- GENERATE CASE WHICH IS EVERY THREE YEARS SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN ADJUST THAT. ON THE WAY HOME EVERY SIX MONTHS SO THIS WOULD BRING US TO THIS POSITION TODAY I THINK IT'S A FAIR. PROCESS AND HOPEFULLY ONE THAT WE WANT TO USE AGAIN BUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COULD WE ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THIS BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION HERE ALL SET CENTER STERN SORRY. CENTER SURROUNDED REQUEST TO SPEAK TO YOUR- I'M SORRY CHARLIE INTENTIONALLY OVERLOOKED FOR THREE FORTY I KNOW I OF THE SPIN WANTED SAY POINTS BY SEN HILL AND SENATOR WIENER ABOUT- EQUAL TREATMENT FOR ALL CUSTOMERS AS IN THE RATE BASE INCLUDING CCA CUSTOMERS APPRECIATE THAT- THE ONE QUESTION WAS ABOUT WITH THERE'S A COST ESTIMATE. OF THE BOND ISSUANCE. IN OTHER WORDS HOW. HOW HOW MUCH DO COST TO ANTICIPATE I REALLY LIKE THE DESIGN OF SMOOTHING OUT ANY RATE IMPACTS FROM THIS UNDER COLLECTION OF JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE IF ANYONE AS THE MATH RIGHT. RIGHT NOW ON THE ESTIMATES FOR THE COST OF INTEREST PAID ON THE BONDS AND HOW MUCH THAT WOULD ACCRUE TO OVERTIME. CENTER BRADFORD OR OR WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION EDISON SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW THIS ONE HAS. YEAH ED IN ISRAEL HAS JUST JOINED AGAIN I APOLOGIZE TO THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ADAM I'M BACK. I'M COULD I GET THE QUESTION WE ST I'M SORRY I REALLY DID JUST ONE SIDE SOMEBODY SENATOR STERN. SIR JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE IN THE IN.

SUPPORT THIS AND- LIKE THE IDEA OF SMOOTHING OVER THE RATE IMPACTS JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE IF WE KNOW GOING INTO IT WHAT THE COST WOULD BE. YEAH M. I CAN TELL YOU WE JUST RECENTLY. FOR THE CALIFORNIA pFINANCING ORDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE- AB TEN FIFTY FOUR KIND OF THE WILDFIRE RELATED COSTS THAT EXISTING FORTY OUT THERE. AND WE'RE COMING IN UNDER 3% ABSOLUTELY I THINK WE'RE- SORT OF. HE THE GOING RANGE RIGHT. EXCELLENTE YOU AND IT SEEMS LIKE A TIMELY MOMENT AND GIVEN THE COST OF BORROWING IS INCREDIBLY LOW IT SEEMS TIMELY THANKS. CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I. WHAT I ALSO WANTED TO RAISE THE ISSUE ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR THE CCA'S TO ALSO BE ABLE TO GET THE KIND OF COST RECOVERY THAT. WE ARE WHO WOULD BE PROVIDING IN THIS BILL TO OUR I. O. U.'S AND I REALIZE THAT THE CPUC COULD POTENTIALLY DO THAT AND I KNOW THAT EDISON IS NOW ANSWERED IN MR- OR SENATOR- WIENER RAISED IT BUT I WANTED TO- JUST TO CONVEY IT BECAUSE I THINK A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL IT'S GOT MAY BE NECESSARY SO THAT THE CPUC REALLY DOES UNDERSTAND OR INTENT AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR WE HAVE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AUTHOR NOT THE AUTHOR SO THE REPRESENTATIVE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFIRMATIVELY ANSWER BUT I WOULD LIKE. THAT TO BE STRONGLY CONVEYED- BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO US I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING IS APPROPRIATE BUT I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO EXTEND THAT NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE BUT NECESSARY FOR THE CCA'S. CENTER WHERE YOU DIRECT YOUR QUESTION WELL. I DON'T KNOW IF MR IF OUR PRESENTER. CAN ANSWER FOR THE AUTHOR OR NOT BUT. GREAT SO RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT I THINK AGAIN THAT'S A REASONABLE REQUEST BECAUSE THERE ARE COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED- I'M JUST SPEAKING TO THAT ASPECT OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY WORKS THERE COST ARE GREAT. MORE UNIQUE AND FAR GREATER. THAN A PARTICULAR POWER SO THAT'S THE POSITION AND I TRIED TO ARTICULATE AND MY CLOTHES BUT I THINK YOU HAVE A VALID ARGUMENT AS TO. OTHER ENTITIES- BEING ABLE TO RECOVER THEIR COSTS AS WELL DURING THE DAY. UNDER COLLECTION THANK YOU AND MAY BE A I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE EVER DONE SUCH A THING FOR PERHAPS THE COMMITTEE COULD CONVEY TO THE AUTHOR WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

THERE COMES LESS THAN A MINUTE. YEAH. MEMBERS OF THE TEAM OUR CHAIR- FOR YOUR INDULGENCE IN YOUR INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT AND NORMA'S PROBLEMS ON OUR HANDS RIGHT NOW WITH THE FIRES THAT ARE BURNING THE STATE WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE FIRE CHALLENGES- THIS BODY. PASSED A BOND MEASURE LAST YEAR THAT AND REFLECTED THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS AND CONCERNS- PARTICULAR WITH REGARDS TO WILDFIRE RESILIENCY OF ALL OF OUR MEMBERS I WAS IN SB FORTY FIVE OBVIOUSLY NOW AND THAT IS NOT HAPPENING BUT WE WORK-REALLY HARD TO CREATE. A SERIES OF EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS IN THE STATE HAS REGARD TO CLIMATE RESILIENCY PARTICULARLY IN THE SPACE OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCY AND THAT IS INCLUDED FUNDING FOR EVERYTHING FROM FROM. ARE CONSERVANCIES IN AND WORK THAT THEY DO IN REDUCING WILDFIRE RISK TO- TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY NOT AND THEN WILD ISLAND URBAN INTERFACE. WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD- PARTNERS IN IN FIRE FIGHTING- AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ROLL THOSE. NEEDS AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE EXPENDITURES INTO THIS PACKAGE. OBVIOUSLY CENTER HERTZBERG GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FINANCING BUT IT'S A CAREFULLY CRAFED. A PACKAGE THAT COMES OUT OF THE WORK THAT HAPPENED WITH SB FORTY FIVE. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I'D LIKE TO I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE FINANCING. OUTSIDE THE DETAILS OF EXPENDITURES BUT- WITH WITH WITH THAT I LOVE TO PASS IT OVER TO SET HER STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT. THE FINANCING MECHANISM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ALLEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE MEMBERS- I WANT TO JUST RAISE A COUPLE OF ISSUES. THAT A PART OF THIS LARGER DISCUSSION. ONE EMPHASIZE WHAT. SENATE ALLEN TALKED ABOUT. FOURTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIREFIGHTERS RIGHT NOW IS RECEIVING THIS COMMITTEE ARE FIGHTING SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIRES ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S BRIEFING THIS MORNING. ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ACRES THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE LAST YEAR LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME ONLY FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES. WE ARE FACING AN EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE. THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT. WELL THESE UTILITIES THAT ARE SO ANXIOUS. NOT TO APPLY THIS FURTHER TO THE IF THIS FURTHER- EXTENSION OF MITIGATION. WE'RE FUNDAMENTALLY ANXIOUS LAST YEAR TO UTILIZE THIS VERY MECHANISM TO IMPOSE ON RATEPAYERS SUPPOSED TO SHAREHOLDERS THE ABILITY TO TRYING TO LATE. THE VICTIMS A FIRE SET DEFAULT TRIANGULATED INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW. IT DOESN'T WORK AND I HAVE SOME THEORIES ON THAT. THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE. NOT ONLY FACING WHAT WHAT I JUST EXPRESSION WOULD CENTER ALLEN EXPRESSED BUT COMPARE THAT TO THE ESTIMATED FORTY BILLION DOLLAR HIT TO RATE PAYERS FOR COST OF THE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS MEASURE IS A BARGAIN. IN TERMS OF PREPARING FOR MITIGATING THE PROBLEM. TOO OFTEN IN POLITICS WE SPEND THE TIME RACING UP TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AFTER THE AIRPLANE IS AT THE BUILDING. THIS MEASURES ABOUT DOING MITIGATING MEASURES TO AVOID THAT BEFORE IT EVER HAPPENS. THE EXACT SAME FUNDING MECHANISM COUPLE OF OTHER ARGUMENTS I WANT TO JUST ADDRESS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ONE OF THE CONCERNS ME AT LEAST SO. IS TO REMIND FOLKS THAT THIS SURCHARGE IN THIS MEASURE. EXTEND THE IS NOT APPLIED TO QUALIFYING LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS A CUSTOMER'S YORKSHIRE CITIES FOR MEDICAL NEEDS. BUT ARGUMENT IS OF THIS HURTS LOW INCOME FOLKS NOT TRUE. SAME MECHANISM THAT THE SENATOR DODD AND OTHERS HAD WORKED ON LAST YEAR IN TEN FIFTY FOUR EXACTLY APPLIED HERE EXACTLY APPLIED HERE. THE OTHER ISSUE IS. THIS LARGER DYNAMIC ABOUT. THE IMPACT ON RATEPAYERS AND WHETHER OR NOT. THIS IS FAIR WELL THIS BILL SAYS AND TO AVOID ANY ISSUE I WANT TO QUOTE PAGE NINE. LINES TWENTY NINE OR TWENTY EIGHT THROUGH THIRTY WHERE IT SAYS. THE MONEY SHOULD BE ALLOCATED PROPORTIONALLY WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA OF THE LARGE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS AND EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA WITHIN THESE AREAS. IT'S THAT'S ONE REFERENCES ANOTHER REFERENCE ON PAGE TWENTY LINE TWENTY NINE. THE POINT IS THAT IF THIS IS RATEPAYER MONEY. THE RATEPAYER MONEY IS TO BE UTILIZED ONLY IN RATE SO SAN DIEGO AT SAN DIEGO'S MONEY P. JEANNIE IT'S MONEY AND EDISON IT'S MONEY TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THESE CHALLENGES WITH THESE FIRES ARE SO. AND CLIMATECHANGE AND THE NUMBER OF LIGHTNING STRIKES IN THE IMPACT YOU KNOW SOMEONE ARGUES WELL THESE WERE CAUSED BY LIGHTNING STRIKES WELL LET'S ASSUME THAT. THE LIGHTNING STRIKES THEN CAUSED A SPARK IN THE TRANSFORMER AND YOU CAN'T MAKE A DETERMINATION. WE'RE TRYING TO MARY WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR TEN FIFTY FOUR. WITH A VERY ELEGANT APPROACH IN TERMS OF WHAT CENTER ISLAND SENATORS STARTED. SEVERAL MULLIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER C. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. EVERYBODY SPENT WELL OVER TWO YEARS NEGOTIATING OF COURSE ARE. THE STEAM. ORTHODOX MEMBER OVER THERE SENATOR STERN BEGAN WHO WORK SO HARD ON THIS TO TRY TO MARRY THESE TWO CONCEPTS AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE FACING SUCH A CRISIS WHERE WE HAVE SPENT YEARS WORKING LITERALLY ON THE FRAMEWORK OF THE FINANCIAL PIECE AND YEARS WORKING ON AND PULLING OUT OF THE THOSE BOND MEASURES THAT WE'RE GONNA GO ON THE BALLOT OR SOME DISCUSSION IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT BONDS BUT THIS ISN'T BONDS THIS IS RARE MONEY. REDUCING THEIR RISK PROFILE IN THIS REGARD. AND THE ARGUMENT THAT I'VE HEARD FROM. I GET IT I SAW. US ONE OF THE SENATORS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT AND REPAIRS HE'S RIGHT. LARGE REPAIRS THEY PAY MOE. WE HAVE OBSERVED JURISPRUDENTIAL MATTER MAY DETERMINATION THAT POOR PEOPLE PAY LESS. RESIDENTIAL'S PAY SOME PORTION AND COMMERCIALS PAY MORE THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY HAS DIED IN THIS GOVERNMENT HAS DONE FOR MANY YEARS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT RIGHT NOW AS WE STAND HERE TODAY THERE'S NO INCREASE IN FEES IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME FEE. THAT B. IS BEEN EXTENDED UNDER TEN FIFTY FOUR THAT CENTER DODD INCIDENT OF A SUMMER HOLDEN OTHERS NEGOTIATED UP UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND THIS JUST SIMPLY EXTENDS THIS TIME FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO GET A REVENUE STREAM AND SENATOR STERN WAS JUST TALKING IS IT RELATED TO THE LAST MEASURE ABOUT HOW CHEAP MONEY AS EVERYBODY WE TALKED TO ALL THE EXPERTS SAY. NOW IS THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS I CLOSER TO PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ELEMENTS MONEY IS THE CHEAPEST IT CAN BE. FOURTEEN BASIS POINTS ON A TWO YEAR TREASURY THAT'S LITERALLY JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN A TENTH OF A PERCENT. THE COST OF MONEY IS THE LAST. AND TO. WHEN WE SPACED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF RISK FROM THE LAST SET OF FIRES WHAT WE SEE NOW IS THE BIGGEST I THINK SENATOR DODD'S DISTRICT AS THE BIGGEST. NOW IN STATE'S HISTORY IF NOT PRETTY CLOSE. N. SHOULDN'T WE INTELLIGENTLY THINK THROUGH AND PLAN IN ADVANCE SHOULD WE LIMIT WHAT THAT RISK IS TO HELP EVERYBODY ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS ONLY DOES IT FOR THE SERVICE AREAS. BUT IT IS INDEED A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS LAST MINUTE BY ITS NATURE BUT IS JUST COBBLING TOGETHER. WELL DEVELOPED COMPONENT PARTS. THAT INFORMED ONE OF THE BIGGEST EMERGENCIES WE'VE EVER FACED IN CALIFORNIA ON TOP OF THE OTHER BIGGEST EMERGENCIES WE'VE EVER FACED IN CALIFORNIA AND WITH THAT I WANT TO JOIN WITH SENATOR ALAN. SEMIR BLOOM MULLIN THE TWENTY THIRTY FROM FORTY SOME CO AUTHORS IN BOTH HOUSES THAT ARE. WORKING HARD TO DEAL WITH THIS EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE FACING THANK YOU. ALL WE HAVE IS WE HAVE AS WITNESSES EXCUSE ME WE'VE GOT TO WITNESSES WITH US FIRST TODAY'S MISTER SCOTT WHICH REPRESENT A COALITION. OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY WORKERS TO CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDS THE RSK IS MEMBERS TOGETHER WITH STACY HEATON WITH THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WHO ALSO UNDERSTANDS EXTRAORDINARY RISK THAT THEIR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN FACING AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER. TO MISTER WHICH IF THAT'S OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN YES MISTER WHICH. REYES WEISEN MIKE NINE OPERATING. CAN WE TRY AGAIN MISTER MUCH YES MISTER CHAIRMAN OF SCOTT WENT TO BE HAPPY CAL CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO THE COMMITTEE WHILE WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND WHY THE OPPOSITION'S OPPOSITION IS SHORT SIGHTED. WE KNOW THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION LINES START FIRES. UNFORTUNATELY THE UTILITIES JURISDICTION OVER CLEARING OF THE BRUSH OF DEBRIS AND TREES IS LIMITED TO FIFTEEN FEET A MERE FIFTEEN FEET AROUND THOSE POWER LINES WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUEL IN THE FORESTS IS NOT AROUND THE POWERLINES. SO YOU TO HE'S IN RATEPAYERS FACE THAT MASSIVE LIABILITY THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY EVENTUALLY WE HAVE SUCH A HUGE. GROWTH BECAUSE OF DEAD TREES DUE TO DROUGHT IN BEATLES. WE NEED TO CLEAR THAT FUEL OUT OR UTILITIES AND RATEPAYERS AND MY MEMBERS WILL SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES IN THE LONG TERM THAT'S WHY THIS MEASURE IS FORWARD THINKING AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. VERY WELL. MRS HE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. I'M HERE TO REPRESENTS THIRTY SEVEN RURAL COUNTIES STATEWIDE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE STARKLY BORNE AND JORIEN DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY HIGH SEVERITY WILDFIRES BUT YOU ALL KNOW AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THAT RESEARCH HAS NOW BECOME A WORSENING STATEWIDE PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. WILDFIRES ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND COMPROMISED THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF MUCH OF THE STATE WATER SUPPLY WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT AND THE FIRES ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO AIR POLLUTION IN PROFOUND WAYS THAT EVEN AIRORT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY ADEQUATELY AT THIS POINT. AS EVIDENCED BY THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE KNOW THE CATASTROPHIC FIRES HAVE A WIDE RANGING I NEED AND CALIFORNIA WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE LONGER WE KEEP DELAYING MEANINGFUL LARGE SCALE WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITIES BUT JUST WANT OUTLINED IN THIS BILL IN FAVOR OF A MORE REACTIONARY RESPONSE THE MORE WEEK AFTER WEEK LAST IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES FORCED WATER. AND AGRICULTURE AND THE MORE WE CONTINUE TO STAND ON FIRE SUPPRESSION AND. REBUILDING EFFORTS IN THE LONG RUN. THE LIBRARY. EVERYONE IN STATE FARM RENDON IN THE TRYING TO ENSURE THEIR HOME TO CENTRAL WORKER THAT WORK. AND SMOKE FILLED KITCHEN. SO SOME OF CAL. LARGEST INTO WHOSE CROPS ARE. BY THE CHANGE THE FILE SMOKE.

THE STATE THE CHECKOUT THE DOLLARS THAT NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING THE BONDS THERE HAVE BOTH YOU KNOW BEEN LIMITED AND CERTAINLY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WE NEED THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO GET THE WORK DONE AND WE NEED TO CLEAR THOSE- THE VEGETATION THAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND THE THREAT IS NOT GOING AWAY I JUST IN OUR DISTRICT- MY DISTRICT THE RESIDENTS ARE JUST ABLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES WHO ARE EVACUATED- A WEEK AND A HALF AGO SO IT IS A CHALLENGE I JUST FOR ME THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE EXPENDITURES PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. AND THE COST BEING BORNE BY THE UTILITY RATE PAYERS IS TENUOUS. HOWEVER NOBLE THE CAUSE AND NO HOWEVER NOBLE THE GOALS ARE OF THIS I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND COMMITTEE. AS I. THINK MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE AND- IN THE CHALLENGES FACED BY CALIFORNIA THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE. AND THE NEXUS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FIRST TO SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR. THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD. OVER THIS ISSUE IN HIS- ERY THOUGHTFUL PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER HILL WE HAVE- MEMBERS ON THEM ON THE- THAT LIKE TO SPEAK SENATOR DOLLY THEN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR CHIANG AND THEN SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FIRST I HAVE A QUESTION FOR- I THINK- CENTER HERTZBERG GOOSE WAS DOING THE FINANCIAL PART OF IT. BY MAY. ASK A QUESTION SO THERE'S- THATTURNED OUT BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THAT IT FAILED ON BONDS AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN WE WOULDN'T START MAKING PAYMENTS ON THOSE BONDS INTEL. FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW UNTIL WHAT IS EXPECTED TOTAL PAY OUT OF THIS TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY BY TWENTY FIFTY ONE THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION. OKAY DON'T ANSWER THAT NOW YOU WANT TO GET THE EXACT QUESTION TO OKAY I'LL GET THE NEXT ONE. LEGIBLE WELL RIGHT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT ANSWER BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER THAT'S FINE YOU CAN ANSWER YOUR CLOTHES OR WHATEVER. YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE BANKING CHAIRS ON THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AND WE TALK ABOUT PREDATORY LENDING. TO FOLKS WHO. DON'T UNDERSTAND FINANCING AND YEAH THISIS IT THIS IS EVEN WORSE THAN PREDATORY LENDING ANY PREDATORY LENDING BILLS WE'VE SEEN. COME THROUGH IN MY OPINION WE HAVE FIFTEEN YEARS OF NOT EVEN MAKING THE NEXT INTEREST PAYMENT. ON UPON. THEY WERE LOANING THE MONEY FOR RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT ONLY- IT'S AND IT'S ONLY A SELECT GROUP OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT WE I WAS INVOLVED IN. A AB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH WAS A BIOMASS BILL. HAS A FIRE- NINE OH ONE A FEW YEARS AGO WE ALL WORK TOGETHER ON IN TEN FIFTY FOUR AND I. HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION FOR- TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF OUR WATERSHEDS IN OUR OUR WILDLIFE AND SEE THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES BURNED. AND BUDGET TO NARROW THIS BILL DOWN TO THREE UTILITIES THREE I USE WHERE'S THE- WHERE'S THE PUBLIC UTILITIES WHERE'S THE- WHERE'S THE NEW NEEDS AND ALL THE OTHER ONES THAT. ARE GETTING A BENEFIT FROM. THE RESOURCES BEING MANAGED AS WELL AND SO IT'S REALLY JUST NARROW IT DOWN TO. THE THREE ITEMS SO THAT I THINK THAT'S- VERY DIFFICULT I LOOK AT THE BILL THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR. THE FRYING CAN NOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S JUST SUPPORT OR OR THAT'S THE NAME ABILITY BILL TO GET A BOAT SOMEWHERE. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN THIS BILL THAT DOESN'T REALLY ADD UP TO WILDFIRE SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF FIRST. QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE. THAT I YOU KNOW THIS IS A I THINK IT. THE BILL THAT REALLY NEEDS A LOT MORE TIME THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. AS IN THIS SESSION AND I KNOW THAT- WE HAVE FIRES THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THE WERE WERE BURNING DOWN IS UNPRECEDENTED. BUT IS THIS REALLY THE ROUTE WE WANT TO GO IT'S REALLY THAT. THE YOU KNOW THE FOLKS OF CALIFORNIA EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA'S IS. LIABLE FOR. THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS INCIDENTS SUCH DISARRAY FOR LACK OF MANAGEMENT FOR. OVER THE LAST. SIXTY YEARS O FOR ME IT'S LIKE WE'RE PICKING OUT ONE SECTOR THAT'S REALLY EASY TO- YOU KNOW YEAH THEY DO CAUSE SOME FIRES BUT ONLY ONE OUT OF TEN FIRES. ARE CAUSED BY UTILITIES WE KNOW THAT FOR A FACT SO. THOSE ARE A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO HAVE ADDRESSED IF YOU MAY. AS CENTERS YOU WANT FOR THAT JIM. BUT THE EASY EXAMPLES DOT WOULD BE THIS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE AUTHORS AND OTHER AUTHORS IN A LOT OF FOLKS TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME. ONE THING THAT'S CLEAR IS THAT BARRING MONEY HAS NEVER BEEN CHEAPER. SO LET'S ASSUME YOU COULD ESTABLISH A LOAN FOR YOUR HOME. AND INSTEAD OF PAYING 5% INTEREST YOU COULD PAY A HALF A PERCENT INTEREST BUT YOU PAID IT ALL AT THE END INSTEAD OF AT THE BEGINNING. THE TEST IS WHETHER IT'S A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND TO THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE TAXPAYERS. OF ANY KIND OF OTHER BORROWING THE TEST WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUE THAT YOU TALK ABOUT A PREDATORY LENDING. IS WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE COST. WHAT'S THE ULTIMATE COST AND THE REALITY IS FROM ALL THE BEST EXPERTS THAT WE CAN FIND FROM ALL THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS WITH WHOM WE HAVE CONSULTED. AND ALL OF THE VARIOUS FOLKS SENATOR A SENATOR BLOOM AND MULLIN OTHERS AS YOU KNOW IS THAT MONEY NEVER CHEAPER AS I SAID EARLIER. IT'S LITERALLY ALMOST A TENTH OF A PERCENT FOR TWO YEAR TREASURY. YOU CAN ESTABLISH THE PRICING NOW. WE HAVE THE NEED NOW IS THE STATE'S BURNING UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE NEED FOR YOUR HOUSE YOUR CAR FOR YOUR FAMILY. AND THIS IS JUST A PAYMENT STRUCTURE THAT QUITE FRANKLY. IS GOING TO BE A LOT CHEAPER THAN G. O. BONDS OR OTHER TYPES OF BONDS. THE BETTER I THE THAT WOULD BE ISSUE. SECOND THING IS. THAT WHEN YOU READ THE MEASURE ITS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS BORROWED WHICH IS CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS FOR WORK RIGHT NOW PUT PEOPLE TO WORK DEAL WITH SOME OF THIS VERY EXTRAORDINARY REYES FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THEN THERE IS THE ISSUE OF APPROPRIATION FOR THE BALANCE OF THE MONEY. THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SCRUB THOSE ISSUES GOING FORWARD. AND THE THIRD THING I THINK THAT GOES TO THE CORE OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE NEXUS ISSUE AND YOUR SENATE ALL YOUR 1000% CORRECT. YOU CANNOT USE RATEPAYER MONEY FOR NON. RATE PAIR INTERESTS. BUT THE ARGUMENT IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE SPEND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS ON ALL THIS LIABILITY ANYTHING WE CAN DO. FOR THE REPAIRS TO REDUCE THAT LIABILITY WOULD BE A PRUDENT THING TO DO. CHECK A LOOK BECAUSE THE UNIX. COSTS ARE CHEAP. IT'S NOT IT'S THE IT'S THE FARTHEST THING AWAY FROM. ANYTHING YOU LOOK AT. IN THE CONTEXT OF. A OF A- A PREDATORY IN THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS. WE ARE IN TOUGH TIMES. AND CREATIVE FINANCING ALLOWS US TO GET THE PEOPLE TO WORK GET THIS WORK DONE NOW WITHOUT PUTTING A BURDEN ON THE BUDGET WITHOUT PUTTING A BURDEN ON THE BUDGET AND ALSO BY THE WAY ZERO BURDEN ON RATEPAYERS. ARE GOING TO PAY A NICKEL A NICKEL UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY SIX THEY'RE JUST GOING TO PAY WHAT WAS UNDER TEN FIFTY FOUR NOBODY HAS ONE. MORE MONEY AND ALSO JUST TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE IF I COULD THAT TURN TALKED ABOUT AND- THE- THE A. R. P. POOR PEOPLE UNDER THE CARE. OF THE TICKET CARE CUSTOMER AND THE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMER IS STILL PROTECTED EXACTLY THE SAME PROTECTIONS OR INTENT FIFTY FOUR I THINK THOSE ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS. I MADE MISTER CHAIRMAN- JUST TO OUR EAST THESE ARE THESE ARE NOT TAX EXEMPT BONDS ARE THEY- NO THEY'RE NOT SO THE RATES GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN THERE USUALLY TAX EXEMPT BONDS ARE GOING TO BE A LOWER AND THE OTHER THING QUESTION I HAD IS WHY ISN'T L. A. D. W. P. A PART OF THIS THEN THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE SOME OF. THE BENEFIT FROM THAT. AS WELL. YES THANK YOU THE REASON THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER. AND THE OTHER MUNICIPAL ONED UTILITIES WOULD BE. IS THAT WOULD BE A NEW TAX THAT WOULD BE A NEW FEE ON CUSTOMERS OVER AND ABOVE WHAT THE EXISTING FOR YEARS. THE NOTION JUST LIKE. WAS ARTICULATED IN TEN FIFTY FOUR THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED IN. THAT THIS WAS A CONTINUING OF THE- AB ONE X. MR KILLIAN TWO THOUSAND WE DID BACK THEN. AND A CONTINUE THE FREE. SO NO ONE WOULD FEEL A GREATER NUMBER. IN TERMS OF IT IT'S JUST EXTENDED OUT. THE MEDIA THE- ISSUE AND MAYBE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THE LAST THING AGAIN. THE BOND LAWYERS. WHO WILL APPROVE THESE LOANS WILL NOT ALLOW. FUNDING THAT IS NOT. THE IT RELATED TO THE NEXUS AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ITS CONTINUING APPROPRIATION PROCESS. WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCRUB PRECISELY THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED. I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER FOR THE ANSWERS ARE TAKING TO ANSWER SOME I JUST WANT TO WIN ENCLOSING MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGING ME- BUT MY QUESTION AT NIGHT I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT. MY FAMILY HOMESTEADED IN CALIFORNIA AND- I PLAN ON STAYING HERE FOR A LONG TIME AND- I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT HOW. WE CAN BORROW MONEY NOW. AT A LESS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THE RATES ARE LOW THAT'S A THAT'S A FACT BUT WHEN YOU'RE BORROWING MONEY THAT YOU'RE NOT STARTING TO PAY ON YOUR CRUISING THAT HALF OF PERCENT. OVER TIME OVER THE FIRST FFTEEN YEARS AND I'M NOT. CONVINCED THAT THAT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR MY- CHILDREN TO BE PAYING OFF- OVER THERE THEY'RE- STARTING THEIR CAREER SO- FOR THAT AND MANY OTHER REASONS I THINK THIS BILL IS. MISGUIDED AND I THINK THAT- I'M I'M NOT. GOING TO BE A NO VOTE ON IT AND I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTERED EARLY- SENATOR STERN. THEN FOLLOWED BY CENTER RUBIO THEN FOLLOWED BY CENTER CHIANG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. PRESHEAF THE COLLOQUY IN THE CLARIFICATION ON THE RATE PAYER ISSUE WHICH I HEARD MENTIONED. THANK SOME MISSTATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY OPPONENTS TALKING ABOUT RATE IMPACTS ON THE MOST VULNERABLE JUST TO REITERATE IS STRUCTURE THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THIS NON BY PASSABLE CHARGES NOT PAID BY. THE LOWEST INCOME RATE PAYERS. AND THE CARE PROGRAM AS WELL AS MEDICAL BASELINE. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE WANT TO KEEP THIS. THIS FIX SURCHARGE SITTING ASIDE AS A BACKSTOP FOR UTILITIES. WHICH IS UNDER CURRENT LAW OR WHETHER WE WANT TO. PUT THIS MONEY TO WORK FILLING CRITICAL GAPS. THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW IN OUR STATE'S CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION BUDGET YEAR AFTER YEAR IN THIS LEGISLATURE AS THIS STATE HAS BURNED. WE HAVE CUT PREVENTION EVERY SING SESSION. WE HAVE STEPPED UP ON SUPPRESSION. WE ARE DOING RIGHT I THINK BY OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FIREFIGHTING FORCE BUYING HELICOPTERS UNISA PRESS WE NEED TO DO. BUT LAST YEAR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO GO TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION CUTS. THIS YEAR ZERO DOLLARS THE HOME HARDENING BUDGET FOR THIS STATE. AB THIRTY EIGHT MISTER WOULD PASSED IT HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN THE BUDGET ZERO. WE HAVE GIVEN COMMUNITIES NO TOOLS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT- THE FORESTRY SIDE OF THINGS AND SORT OF. THE DEEPER RURAL AREAS AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES. BUT WHERE WHERE I LIVE AND WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE LIVE IS RIGHT ON THE EDGE. IT'S THAT WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND THE KIND OF JOBS OF THIS WOULD GENERATE ARE NOT JUST RELEGATED BY THE WAY TO THE FIRE COMMUNITIES ANYONE CAN GET A GOOD HARD WORKING JOB AND HAVE A LONG TERM CAREER PATHWAY THROUGH THE LARGEST EVER INVESTMENT IN A CLIMATE RESILIENCY WORK FORCE IN STATE HISTORY. WITH THIS MEASURE. THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FUND THIS PUTS TOGETHER IS NOT JUST ABOUT A TEMPORARY LANDSCAPING JOB. IS ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE TO WORK RIGHT NOW UCLA LUSKIN CENTER DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST JOBS INTENSIVE. CLIMATE INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE IS A STATE. AND THIS KIND OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE INVESTMENT IS THE MOST JOBS INTENSIVE INVESTMENT YOU CAN POSSIBLY MAKE BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A LOT OF PEOPLE GETTING OUT THERE AND DOING WORK FOR PUTTING GAS GETTING ON YOUR VETS SEALING YOUR ROOF SERVICEMEMBERS CAN'T GET IN AND BURN DOWN YOUR HOUSE FROM THE INSIDE DOING THAT LANDSCAPING WORK. WE LOOK DOWN ON LANDSCAPERS AND TRY TO TREAT THEM LIKE- IT'S JUST IT'S JUST THE GARDENER GUY WITH A LEAF BLOWER IT'S TIME WE START LOOKING DOWN ON PEOPLE WHO DO THAT HARD WORK AND REALIZE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MAIN JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOING FORWARD AND THIS BILL FINALLY PUT SOME MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. THERE'S ALSO MONEY FOR BACK UP POWER WE UST SAW WE- WE CONTINUE. TO LOSE POWER AT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN NURSING HOMES FOR PEOPLE IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHO CAN'T KEEP THEIR AC ON DURING THE POWER OUTAGE WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GO TO A COOLING CENTER RIGHT NOW OPTIONS ARE LIMITED THIS BILL STEPS IN AND ACTUALLY STEPS UP FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES. LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY THE PRIORITIZATION IN THIS FIELD OF THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT ORIENTATION. THERE ARE WEALTHY PEOPLE IN THIS STATE AND I REPRESENT SOME OF THEM. IN MALIBU AND CALABASAS HIGH INCOME MORNING BRACKETS THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT HARDENING WORK ON THEIR OWN. THIS BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO SUBSIDIZE THOSE FOLKS BUT WHEN YOU'RE ON A FIXED INCOME. AND YOU'VE YOU'RE LIVING IN AN AREA YOU NEVER THOUGHT WOULD BURN DOWN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN. YOU DIDN'T DO THAT GAS GETTING WORK ON YOUR GARAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE SOMEONE COME OVER AND DO THE PATCH WORK YOU NEED DONE. AND THEN YOUR WHOLE LIFE INVESTMENT BURNS DOWN BEFORE YOUR VERY EYES. THAT'S A TRAGEDY THAT WE CAN AVOID. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. WHETHER WE'RE TRYING TO PUT OUR THUMB ON THE SCALE AND DO THE WRONG KINDS OF FIRE TREATMENT IN THESE KINDS OF COMMUNITIES FOR INSTANCE WE SHOULD HAVE PRESCRIBED FIRE IN SENSITIVE NATURAL HABITATS WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING TYPE CONVERSION OR GETTING. RID OF NATIVE PLANTS IN FACT USING THAT LIVE OAKS PREVENT FIRE THOSE ARE NATURAL BUFFERS- I WOULD SAY I'M ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL BUT ALSO WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WILL GET A SECOND BITE AT THIS APPLE TO REFINE THIS PLAN AND I HAVE AN EXPECTATION. THAT WHAT THAT FINAL PLAN WILL LOOK LIKE IF WE CAN GET THIS ARCHITECTURE IN THE LAW WILL NOT PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE TO DO THE WRONG KINDS OF FIRE TREATMENTS IN THE WRONG KINDS IN NEIGHBORHOODS. IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT NO PRESCRIBED FIRE IN SENSITIVE HABITAT. AND REALLY MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT FINALLY GETTING DOLLARS MOVING ON PREVENTING THESE TRAGEDIES WE WILL SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ACCORDING UCLA'S ANALYSIS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS. FROM THIS INITIAL INVESTMENTS. THIS IS A GOOD BILL. WE KNOW IT'S LATE BUT THE CLOCK HAS BEEN TICKING ON US FOR TOO MANY YEARS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO SIT I APPRECIATE THE CREATIVE MECHANICS DONE BY SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND- I THINK IT'S WORTH MOVING THIS MEASURE FORWARD IN GETTING SOMETHING DONE BEFORE WE LEAVE SESSION THIS WEEK. IF WE DON'T MOVE WILD FIRE MONEY BEFORE WE LEAVE THIS SESSION. WE'RE DOING MALPRACTICE PEOPLE STATED CALIFORNIA. THANK CENTER STERN CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. I WILL FIRST OF ALL ON I THINK THE AUTHOR AND ANALYTICAL AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD I THINK THAT TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US ON THIS FLOOR- IN THE SENATE LEGISLATURE- IS VERY INTERESTED IN RYING TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH THE WILDFIRES THAT. HAVE BEEN. REALLY RAVAGING SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES- YOU KNOW I HAD A FIRE ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND A CAESAR HILLS WHICH IS. MALES THAT I REPRESENT AND SO I WANT TO BE. MINDFUL AND THANKFUL TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GET CREATIVE WITH MEASURES I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GET CREATIVE WITH FUNDING. THAT'S WHY AS A CHAIR OF INSURANCE TAX SET UP TO. TO PROPOSE SOME BILLS TO SEE WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE FUNDING MECHANISM INCLUDING BEST PRACTICES FOR MEDICATION- FIRE RESISTANT MATERIALS AND OTHER ITEMS THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE HELPFUL I DO AGREE WITH. WHAT THE GREAT CENTER FROM- MALIBU IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS FOR FAMILIES FOR PEOPLE TO FIGHT FIRES AND I ALSO. TO AGREE WITH THE GREAT SENATOR FOR FROM THE SENATE TELL THAT.THERE'S A STRUGGLE HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR RATE PAYERS. WILL BE IMPACTED I KNOW THAT I REPRESENT S. C. E. THEY'RE MY DISTRICT AND SO. I'M VERY MINDFUL THAT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR THE REPAIRS HIMSELF. THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT BILL AS- THE CENTER FROM SAN MATTEO EXPRESSED. IT IS SEVENTY NINE- WE PROBABLY NEED TO VENT A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT WE KNOW THAT WHERE YOU. HAVE VERY LIMITED TIME GIVEN THIS CALL BUT CRISIS AND HOW LITTLE WE HAVE TIME TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE. SINCE THE OUR THAT THIS HAS BEEN IN PRINT I'VE BEEN. REALLY AGGRESSIVELY BEEN- I HAVE. CALLED AND TEXTED AND SENT LETTERS FROM MY DISTRICT AND- FOR ME RIGHT NOW I REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO ADDRESS SOME OF MY DISTRICT CONCERN. I KNOW THAT I ALWAYS DO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I PRIDE MYSELF. AND REACHING REACHING OUT. OF THREE QUESTIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS IS- CUTTING MY DISTRICT A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN- AND SO I AGREE WITH THE CONCEPT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE AT THE- A MAJORITY LEADER BUT- AT THIS POINT I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO- STAY OFTEN I'M- VERY. EAGER AND OPEN TO HAVE THIS DEBATE ON THE FLOOR AND- AND RE REACH OUT TO MY COMMUNITY WHICH WILL BE IMPACTED AND SEE IF WE. CAN GET THERE THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG. THANK YOU MISTER YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED TO LINE MY COMMENTS ALSO WITH THAT SENATOR COLLEEN AND- SENATOR RUBIO AS WELL. BUT I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION- YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD ASPECTS OF THIS BILL FOR EXAMPLE THE HUNDRED MILLION. A TO STATE PARKS TO REDUCE THE RISK WHILE FIRING RESTORED FIRE RELATED DEATH AND JUST I HAVE TO KNOW HOW STATE PARK IN MY DISTRICT AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A GREAT ORGANIZATION IN MY DISTRICT TO. EXPAND EXPANDED IN ORDER TO PROTECT ITS BEAUTIFUL OPEN SPACE AND WILDLIFE. AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK. ON YOU KNOW FINDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE PROTECTION AT THE STATE PARK AND OTHERS. UNFORTUNATELY THE FINANCING MECHANISM IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS NOT SOMETHING I CAN SUPPORT TODAY- I HARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY HE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND HOW DIVERSE TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. AND YOU KNOW TO GET THE FIGHT I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS FUNDING MECHANISM WOULD MEAN ADDITIONAL COST BURDENS ON ON RATE PAYERS AND THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE FOR ME IN MY DISTRICT- AND IF THIS DOESN'T GET TO THE GOVERNOR I'D REALLY LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON A FINDING OTHER FINANCING MECHANISMS OR YOU KNOW. FIGURE SOMETHING OUT OF IT YOU KNOW FOR SOME OF THESE EFFORTS SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE BUT UNFORTUNATELY. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SO BRADFORD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OF THE MEMBERS AND SERVICIOS SIMONE BLUM IN HIS WORK ON THIS EFFORT. BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL ALL BUT UNDERMINE ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR DID LIVE HERE THROUGH- AB TEN FIFTY FOUR TO HELP STABILIZE THE UTILITY INDUSTRY AND I'M CONCERNED HOLE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES WILL VIEW THIS MEASURE AND IT WILL IT COST TO BE A INCREASED COST IN BARNEY FOR- THE UTILITIES I MEAN. I HEARD A WHOLE LOT OF DEBATE I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A SHARED COST THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS SIMILAR TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA STATED A LOT OF THESE FIRES DIDN'T HAPPEN AND I OWE YOU TEAR TOLD TERREUS SOLELY. AND AGAIN JUST ABOUT 10% ARE STARTED BY A QUICK MINIMUM FOR STRUCTURE AGAIN THE FIRES THAT WE'VE WITNESSED FOR THE LAST MONTH I'VE BEEN PRIMARILY CAUSED BY MOTHER NATURE AND WE NEED TO. BE A LITTLE BIT MORE. I ABOUT THE AND THE YOU TO ARE NOT POLICY ALL THESE FIRES THEY'RE DOING A GREAT WORKING HARDENING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT MOTHER NATURE HAS BEEN DOING THIS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. IF YOU TALK TO OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT TELL YOU THEY WALKING FIRE TO HELP MANAGE. THE FORCED TO THE HOPE. DANIEL I BROKE AS WELL SO WE HAVE A BIT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR AS YOU TALK TO SOME OF OUR FORSTER'S BECAUSE WE FAILED TO MANAGE BUT I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE FACT THAT. I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A SHARED COST I THINK. ON MUNICIPALITIES AND THE PUBLIC OWNED UTILITIES- THEY'VE EXPERIENCED MANY OF THESE FIRES MANY STARTED IN THEIR DISTRICT AND I THINK THIS COST. IF THERE WILL BE A COSTS SHOULD BE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST SEN I KNOW YOU TERRITORY SO. THAT'S WHERE I STAND ON THIS ISSUE. OKAY ANYONE ELSE CENTER BAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. I THINK MANY OF US IN THIS COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE BEEN RAVAGING THE STATE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. IN THE LAST. IN A TEN DAY SPAN HERE IN AUGUST ONE POINT SIX MILLION ONE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES OF WILDLAND HAVE BEEN BURNED OUT BY A MAKE A WHILE IN SIZE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA HUNDREDS OF HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST IN LIVES ATTENDED. WHEN YOU TRAVEL NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO IN GET INTO CINEMA AND LAKE NAPA AS WELL AS MENDOCINO COUNTY'S. THOSE TWO COUNTIES OUT OF THOSE FOUR COUNTIES IN OUR HOME TO NOT ONLY THE LARGEST WILDFIRE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY BUT NOW THE SECOND LARGEST WHILE IN FIRING SENATOR DODD'S DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE DISTRICT. THAT I REPRESENT IN LAKE COUNTY. WELL THERE ARE NO SIMPLE FIXES TO THIS ISSUE. WHAT WE CAN'T DO THIS YEAR WE CANNOT LEAVE THIS SESSION WITHOUT INVESTING IN WILDFIRE PROTECTION AND SAFETY IN PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE. IN THIS THIS LEGISLATURE HAS STEPPED UP TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST UTILITIES BE SECURITIZED THERE DIDN'T APPEAR TO STAY AFLOAT. YET WE ARE HERE DEBATING HOW WE CAN ASSIST OUR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO STAY SAFE. AGAIN THERE ARE NO SILVER BULLETS IN THE TABLE TODAY BUT THIS IS THE BEST TOOL THAT WE HAVE. RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND SAFETY. I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD SEE. A BILLIONAIRE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN AYE VOTE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK THIS ISSUE. TRY TO SECURE THE FUNDS TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE IN THE BILL TO STOP THESE HOMES AND THEN BURNING DOWN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WELL THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE ANY ANY OTHER. CENTERS WHICH TO SPEAK. OUT RESEARCHER. THE LAST CENTER DOT FILIBUSTER MARLA. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I'D LIKE TO THANK THE BILL'S AUTHORS FOR JOCKEYS. WHATEVER FOR I BRING THIS UP TODAY THERE ARE YES- THE SENATOR AND I CONSIDER MCGUIRE HAS JUST SAID THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF GOOD OPTIONS. IS THIS A PERFECT OPTION NO BUT I TOTALLY AGREE. THAT WE HAVE TO LEAVE THE SESSION WAS SOMETHING IN IT AND PLAY IT POTENTIALLY. WITH OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT I DON'T REALLY SEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY BIG POTS OF MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE TYPE OF THINGS MOVING FORWARD- FOR SENATOR- DOLLING- HE'LL REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE DOING. IN A FEW BILLS YEAH BEFORE TEN FIFTY FOUR MOST MOST NOTABLY TRIED THE ACTUALLY BEFORE THAT SB NINE OH ONE EIGHT. SB. NINE OH ONE. JUST GETTING THE ADMINISTRATION AT THAT TIME. TO COME FOR WITH A THE BIG DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE SOME OF THESE FIRES AND PROBLEMS WAS- YOU KNOW IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW. IN THIS FORWARD SOME OF THESE INEQUITIES WITH WITH REGARDS TO OTHER UTILITY I JUST DON'T I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S WORTHY OF A CHANGING THE POSITION OUR TRAJECTORY OF THIS BILL. THAT'S AS FAR AS OTHER REPAIRS CAN'T AFFORD IT THEY CAN AFFORD IT NOW THERE FORTY EIGHT EVERY SINGLE- EVERY EVERY SINGLE MONTH RIGHT NOW WHICH IS GOING TO LAST A LITTLE BIT LONGER SO WITH THAT I ANSWER I'M. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER MORE LUCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I THOUGHT WE'D SEEN IT ALL- I WAS UP HERE TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN THE LIGHTNING STORMS HERE TODAY. I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF LIGHTNING STORMS BUT THAT WAS LIKE A WAR ZONE AND IT MADE YOU WONDER YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN TO THE STATE- YOU KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY OVERDUE FOR A GOOD EARTHQUAKE I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT BUT IT. MIGHT YOU KNOW SIX THREE TO TWELVE CERTAINLY HAD. SOME INTERESTING ISSUES BUT- THIS IDEA OF BORROWING- AT A VERY LOW RATE. IS A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT. UNLESS UNLESS WE- HAVE DEFLATION. AND WE FIND OURSELVES. BAYING WHERE THE MORE EXPENSIVE DOLLARS. ALONE IN THE FUTURE IT DIDN'T DIDN'T IT WILL HAVE BACKFIRED ON US AND I HAVE NOTHEARD THIS LEGISLATURE TALK ABOUT AS MUCH DEBT AS WE HAVE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASKING EMPLOYEES TO CUT THEIR PAY BUT ALL WE DID WAS GIVE THEM FOR LOS THAT THEY CAN BANKS AND THEY COULD CASH OUT LATER THAT'S BORROWING WE TOLD THEM THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY INTO THEIR PAST ARE OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THE BEST STATS ANOTHER. INCREASING DEBT THAT'S CLOSE TO. NINETY BILLION DOLLARS IT JUST WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HAVING CORPORATIONS PREPAY THEIR- INCOME TAXES- IN IN SORT OF A CERTIFICATE IDEA. WE'RE BOUNCING AROUND SO MANY IDEAS ON ON DECK AND WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DONE TO TRY TO ELECTRIFY. THIS STATE AND WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE TRYING I APPRECIATE BUT WITH THE STATE'S. HYDRO AND NUCLEAR ARE NOT RENEWABLE AND THEN THE FORCE WIND. SOLAR MERA FARMS- WHICH ARE. YOU KNOW I WON'T EVEN GO DOWN THAT ROAD- AND THEN THE IN FORM THE I. O. USE THAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO ALL THESE THINGS. AND THEN WHAT DO THEY DO THEY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE STATE WHAT WHAT ELSE IS THERE BEING A YANKEES AND BACK AND FORTH AND THAT GIVES US THESE. TRANSMISSION LINES THAT ARE NOW OLD FREIGHT AND NEED TO BE REPAIRED SO I WOULD SAY THAT SACRAMENTO HAS NOT BEEN PROACTIVE IT HAS A LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. AND EXIST. SURE THIS BILL IS REACT. AND IS ARE. DO THIS ACKERMAN LACK OF. IT'S A LITTLE. BECAUSE CONSTANTLY YANKING I KNOW YOU WITH A J. AROUND THE ONE THIS WAY. AND THAT WAY ALL ITS- IS THAT CENTRO PLANNING IS A JOKE A SAD JOKE SO NOW THE SOLUTION IS X. SIR SEARCH. WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO ATTACK INCREASE IN THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF ANSWER WE SHOULD BE GIVING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. THIS IS NOT A BILL. IT WOULD SEEM MORE REASONABLE TO PREPARE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN DROPPING OR MAYBE POSTPONING CERTAIN IDEOLOGIES AND RUN ARE YOU USED TO LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE RUN. WITHOUT CONSTANTLY WHICH SIGN WHAT SHOULD BE. AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN A REASONABLE AND REALISTIC PROCESS TO PROPERLY ELECTRIFY. CALIFORNIA IN AND FOR THOSE REASONS AND MORE I AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU- CENTER MORLOCK- FOR MY OWN COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL. I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO COMBAT WILDFIRES I THINK IT IS WITH IT IS A GROWING PROBLEM. AND I WANT TO THANK CENTER HERTZBERG CENTER ALAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. FROM EARLY TRYING TO IRON OUT. THIS PROBLEM WORKING ON AND I REALLY REALLY BELIEVE YOU SHOULD BE COMMENDED. FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AND YOUR PASSION. HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND- TRYING TO BRING AT LEAST SOMETHING FORWARD THAT WILL HELP- WITH BUT FIRE SHOULD. I JUST HAVE. AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM FOR YOU FOR USING RATEPAYER FUNDS TO CREATE A FIREFIGHTING PROGRAM THE STATE I THINK WE COULD. DEFINITELY GENERATE THOSE FUNDS FROM OTHER SOURCES AND I THINK WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD EVEN BE ALLOWABLE TO USE THESE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY TO FIGHT FIRES A KNOWLEDGE EXPLAIN WHY I SAY THAT. CURRENTLY OF RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED TO HARDEN IT. TO MAKE IT MORE RESISTANCE TO FIRES AND TO. CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS. INSTIGATING WINDS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN AT AND MORE VIOLENT THAN MANY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE EVER COULD HAVE ENVISIONED. AND SO THESE THESE FUNDS SHOULD COME FROM REPAIR FUNDS WE ALREADY HAVE A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THAT THROUGH THE PC. AS I LOOK AT THIS BILL AND I SEE HOW THEY'RE THEY'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW THE DAY- PRIVATE UTILITIES TO- FIND THIS THIS PROGRAM. YOU KNOW I REALLY THINK IT DOESN'T COVER THE STATE STRATEGICALLY. AND I UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THE PRIVATE UTILITIES COVER CALIFORNIA IT IS A LARGE SWATH BUTTER IN OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE OF THAT THEY ALSO NEED TO BE INCLUDED. IN IN A MITIGATION PROGRAM. AND THAT NEEDS TO REALLY BE FOUGHT OUT. AN END TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE REPAIR FUNDS SHOULD BE USED TO HARDEN THE GRID I SUPPORT THAT. AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WILL SUPPORT THAT I WILL SUPPORT ITIS WELL IF IT GOES OUTSIDE OF THAT I WILL NOT BECAUSE THOSE ARE AREAS. THAT SHOULD BE INVESTED IN FROM OTHER FINANCE. I ALSO WANT TO ADD. THAT IS ILLEGAL COUNTY SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE. AND CENTER MCGUIRE I JUST WANT TO. CORRECT YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM YOUR DISTRICT. BUT IN SAN DIEGO OUR OUR OUR TRAGEDY STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. WITH THE CEDAR CREEK FIRES. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE HAD A FIRE IN JULIAN THAT BASICALLY DESTROYED THE ENTIRE. I WOULD SAY MID MAJOR PART OF THE OF THE JULIAN FORCE THAT HAS NOT REGENERATED SINCE THEN. I DRIVE THERE EVERY NOW AND THEN AND I HAVEN'T SEEN OF A NEW PINE TREE GROW IN THAT AREA. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY DESTRUCTIVE FIRES ARE. RAVAGING OUR FORESTS. AND BACK THEN I REMEMBER A SCIENCE TO SAY THAT THAT FORCE WOULD NEVER COME BACK AND HE WAS RIGHT. AND THAT IS OF EXTREME CONCERN IF THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN OTHER PARTS OF STATE I UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE FOUND.% OTHER OTHER SOURCES TO FIND. TREE PLANTINGS AND OTHER PROJECTS BUT- IN SAN DIEGO WE STARTED ORG HARDENING THE GRID IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE IN SAN DIEGO RATEPAYERS HAVE SUPPORTED TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF HARDENING PROJECTS. THAT INCLUDE A WEATHER STATION THAT INCLUDE A RAPID. RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAVE REALLY HELPED TO REDUCE NEW FIRES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HARMFUL. THAT TWO BILLION HAS BEEN MADE. OVER OVER A DECADE. AND HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AT MITIGATING THESE WILDFIRES THAT'S WHY WHEN I SEE THAT ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL AMOUNT MAYBE A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THREE. BILLION DOLLARS BILLION- FURTHER BURDENING RATEPAYERS IN SAN DIEGO WHEN WE HAVE A PROGRAM WE'VE HAD SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS TO HARDEN THE GRID. YES THERE ARE MORE THINGS TO DO. AND THAT WHAT THAT PROCESS IS ALREADY ALLOWED UNDER THE P. YOU SEE AND- THE PC CAN MORE EXACTLY. ALLOW THE UTILITIES TO INVEST IN AREAS TO HARDEN THE GRID. IN WAYS THAT WILL PROTECT NOT ONLY THE RATE PAYERS BUT ALSO PROTECT. THE YOU PUT THE UTILITIES FROM OF HAVING THEIR EQUIPMENT SPARKED FIRE SO WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME THAT THIS IS ABOUT. PARTY IN THE GRID I DON'T I REALLY DON'T BY THAT BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE THAT MECHANISM ALLOWED WITHIN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROP PROCESS AND SCRUTINIZE. THOSE PROPOSALS AND REALLY LOOK AT HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO BE INVESTED IN HARDENING THE GRID. AND HOW MUCH IS REALLY HOW FOR HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO GO TO HELP PREVENT WILDFIRES AND DISASTERS IN OUR STATE. BUT I THINK I'VE I'VE I'VE SAID ENOUGH I HAVE A HARD TIME SUPPORTING THIS JUST BECAUSE HONESTLY I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD ENOUGH TIME TO SCRUTINIZE THIS BILL AND THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHERE I'M COMING FROM I SEE THAT WE COULD STILL MOVE FORWARD. AND MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR WE RAISED SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO COMBAT WILDFIRES AND THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY THAT'S MONEY THAT IS HAS BEEN SPENT AND IS BEING SPENT TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT TO COMBAT FIRES TWO OF. WORK ON SUPPRESSION PROJECTS THAT WILL PREVENT FIRES AND IF WE CAN WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE STATE STRATEGICALLY AND LOOKS AT HOW WILDFIRE AREAS AND COMES UP WITH A STRATEGY I WILL SUPPORT IT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I FIND MYSELF IN A TOUGH PLACE BETWEEN FRIENDS ON BOTH SIDES AND INTERESTS ON BOTH SIDES THAT. ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE AND- HIGH IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAT OF WHICH- I THINK WOULD STAND TO. BENEFIT ENORMOUSLY BY PROGRAM. AND WE DO NEED TO PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND- HOPEFULLY WITH THE WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE DONE AND ALL THE VARIOUS WATER BONDS PARK FUNDS AND OTHER FUNDS WE'VE- POST AND ALL THAT MONEY HASN'T BEEN EXHAUSTED HOPEFULLY THAT COULD BE- THE EXPEDITED TO GET PEOPLE TO. START START GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK SOONER RATHER THAN LATER AND WITHIN ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS THERE. THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DESIGNED INTO- FIRE SUPPRESSION. AND READ IT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF FUEL. IN THE ENVIRONMENT SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE TO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS BILL. I'M SORRY. THE DOT DALI DO YOU STILL WANT TO SPEAK AGAIN. WE HAVE A QUESTION OR WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE CENTER DOLLY. HERE PLEASE UNDER YOURSELF. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES THANK YOU I HAD ONE LAST QUESTION FOR A CENTER HERTZBERG SO WE DID TEN TEN FIFTY FOUR LAST YEAR WHICH WAS TO STABILIZE THE- THE RATINGS SO THEY COULD ACTUALLY BORROW MONEY. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY. MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR THEM TO BORROW MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE LAYING OUT BURNING ON THEM AGAIN A COULD YOU ANSWER ME HOW THEY COULD IT COULD POSSIBLY PUSH UP THEIR ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY AGAIN BY DOING THIS. ACTUAL PROCEDURE THAT THAT'S WHY WE DID TEN FIFTY FOUR WAS TO ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO SECURITIZE THAT THAT AND BORROW. GIVE ME. THAT EXACT QUESTION WAS ASKED OF ME FROM THE C. E. O. OF PGNIG. WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM WITH HIS LOBBYISTS YESTERDAY I GIVE ME THE ANSWER AND I SEARCH I CONFIRM THAT ANSWERED WITH THE BEST EXPERTS IN THE FINANCIAL SPACE. WHO BASICALLY TOLD ME ONE THAT IN FACT YOU'RE DE RISKING THE PROBLEM FOR THE UTILITIES ON THE ONE HAND. BY VIRTUE OF REDUCING FIRE RISKS WHICH IS WITH INVERSE CONDEMNATION CAN DESTROY THESE COMPANIES. AND THAT IN FACT YOU CAN ENHANCE THEIR RATING A THEIR RATINGS. AND TWO BECAUSE THERE IS NO BURDEN ON THESE COMPANIES TO THE OFF BALANCE SHEET FOR FIFTEEN YEARS THERE'S NO BURDEN AT ALL IN THE RATINGS. SO IN FACT IT HAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE EFFECT OF THE INTENT OF THE QUESTION I THINK IN FACT HELPS THE COMPANIES WITH BORROWING BY DE RISKING THEIR FIRE RISK. BECAUSE OF THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION LAW IN CALIFORNIA. VERY WELL TO WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY DID YOU WANNA MAKE CLOSING COMMENTS CENTER HERTZBERG ROUTE WHERE THOSE YOUR PER CLOSING COMMENTS JUST A FEW FEW CLOSING COMMENTS I KNOW WE BOTH WANT TO MAKE MEMBERS- WE KNOW WE'VE GOT A HUGE CRISIS ON OUR HANDS WE'VE GOT OUR STATE IS BURNING- THIS THIS SENATE PASSED AND WITH A STRONG MAJORITY.

INCOMING AND BEING CREATIVE. THE IMPACT OF THIS IS NOT UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY SIX. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO BORROW. SENATOR BILL SENT ME A NOTE AND I THINK HE'S RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT INFLATION FACTORS VERSUS THE ABILITY TO SET THE RATE NOW. THAT'S THE KEY WE CAN BORROW NOW AT A CHEAPER RATE. THE GOVERNMENT ARE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE. THESE OTHER ISSUES WITH THE ABILITY TO DEBATE THE ISSUE IS TO NEXUS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. BUT WE MAKE A BIG STATEMENT. GOING FORWARD. THAT THIS REALLY ISN'T JUST MOVING THE DOLLARS I WANT TO SHARE. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE BIG RATING AGENCIES. AND WHAT THE BECAUSE I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BORING I THOUGHT WAS CENTER MORE LIKE CITIES RIGHT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HE SAID. BUT WHAT THEY TELL US AS WE FACE THIS PANDEMIC. THE FIRES AND ALL THE THINGS. THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IS DO WE OFFER A VISION FORWARD THAN WHAT THE DEBT EQUITY RATIO IS. DO WE HAVE A PLAN AS A GOVERNMENT. TO MOVE FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE CHALLENGES AND MITIGATE THE RISK THAT'S THE BIGGER THING WHEN THEY LOOK TO A RATING THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I DO KNOW THAT WE OFTEN FACE THAT ISSUE OF THE YOU KNOW OUR DEBT RATING IN THE LIGHT. BUT I'M TELLING YOU WE HAVE VETTED THIS WITH FOLKS DEALING WITH THE LARGER ISSUE. I WANT TO THANK MR LEOPARDS THE CRAVEN I WANT TO THANK. SORRY OF MY OFFICE SOMEONE THANK ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE ASSEMBLY WORKED HARD ON THIS. I THINK THAT THE ARGUMENT WITH RELATED TRANSPARENCY IS WRONG.
