00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:16.706
PROBABLY VERY STRANGE AND-

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:19.042
RIGID UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:20.844
A GOOD BILL IN WHAT WAS A BAD

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:26.616

THIS BODY AND IT WASN'T JUST

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:51.942
DEMOCRATS. IT WAS REPUBLICAN.

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:55.278
IT WASN'T JUST MAN. IT WAS ALSO

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:56.713
THE WOMEN ALTHOUGH I SAID THAT

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.784
IN REVERSE. IT WASN'T JUST

00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:02.652
MEMBERS FROM THE BLACK CAUCUS.

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:04.120

THINK WE GET MORE WHEN WE AGREE

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:54.971
TO DISAGREE. ON POLICY BUT WHEN

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.940
WE STILL TREAT PEOPLE AND

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.708
THEY'RE DISTRICTS AND THEIR

00:52:58.775 --> 00:53:01.912
CONSTITUENTS AND THEIR VALUE.

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:06.683
WITH DIGNITY. THAT IS WHAT THIS

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:10.787
