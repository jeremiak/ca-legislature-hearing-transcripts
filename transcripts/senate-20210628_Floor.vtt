00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.900
STRESS. THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:10.768
OF THE STATE IT IS GOING TO

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:13.037
TAKE US TIME TO RECOVER. AND

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:15.139
THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED. TO

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:17.308
COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. IS

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:20.144
TO HAVE WAVES OF AFFECTIONS AND

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:32.323
WAVES OF EVEN MORE HOMELESSNESS.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.957
AND WE HAVE ALREADY DONE WILL.

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:34.425
EMPTY OUR ABILITY. TO RECOVER.

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:35.026
I WANT TO BE FREE THIS STILL

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.161
NOT. THIS WAS OVER OF GIVEN TO-

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:37.962
THERE ARE GOOD THINGS THIS BILL

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.497
THE EXTENT OF THE MORE. THE

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:41.666
INCREASE TO A 100% THE FACT

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:43.901
THAT WE'RE NOW ALLOWING TENANTS

00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:45.002
TO APPLY DIRECTLY AND THEY

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:47.905
DON'T JUST HAVE TO. RELY ON

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:49.607
THEIR LANDLORD TO APPLY THE

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:51.175
FACT THAT WE NOW HAVE STRONGER

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:53.444
INCENTIVES FOR LANDLORDS TO

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:54.745
PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY MAY

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.414
NOT GET AN INFECTION IF THEY

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.282
DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:00.184
GETTING A 100% OF THE RENT.

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:03.154
PAID THAT IS ALL GOOD WE WILL

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.790
ALLOW MORE TENANTS- TO AVOID

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:07.858
RENT THAT MORE LANDLORDS WILL

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:08.492
GET PAID ALL OF THEIR

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:11.128
BACKGROUND. I'M NOT A FAN OF

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:13.230
SOME PIECES OF THIS LIKE THE-

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:16.467
THE LONG PREEMPTION- BYE YOU

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.169

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:20.338
NEGOTIATION AND GIVE AND TAKE.

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.339
AND I THINK IT IS A GOOD

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.374
PRODUCT WHAT I DO JUST WANT TO

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:26.010
CLOSE BY SAYING WE HAVE TO.

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:28.179

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:30.781
AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:32.984
THIS A MUCH EASIER PROCESS FOR

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.218
PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY APPLY FOR

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:35.953

CAN'T GET ANYONE ON THE PHONE

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.429
WE MUST MOVE THIS MONEY OUT TO

00:37:45.496 --> 00:37:46.597
THE PEOPLE BOTH LANDLORDS AND

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:49.166
TENANTS WHO NEED IT- WE HAVE TO

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:50.701
DO BETTER IN THAT REGARD. BUT

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.236
THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.939

AFRICAN AMERICAN. FOR EXAMPLE

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:23.567
AFTER AMERICAN PEOPLE MAKE UP

80% OF LA COUNTY BUT OVER 40%

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:27.938
OF THE HOMELESSNESS WE SHOULD

ABOUT HALL CUMBERSOME AND

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:59.503
DIFFICULT THIS WAS IN THE FACT

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.372

IMPACT ON PEOPLE- I ALSO HAVE

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:30.935
EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT THIS

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:32.703
RULE SINCE ITS PROGRAM MIGHT

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.038
NOT BE REACHING ALL THE

BROWN COMMUNITIES- TODAY'S

FUNDING TO ETHNIC MEDIA VIA THE

STATE LIBRARY BUT I DON'T

00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:55.826
THINK. THAT'S THE REAL ANSWER.

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.328
IT'S A GOOD MEASURE AND IT

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:58.429
COULD COMPLEMENT OUR EFFORTS

00:39:58.496 --> 00:39:59.897
BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:01.132

THE AUTHOR. SENECA WHERE WE

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:17.181

UNDERSTAND CLEARLY THAT IN

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.455
ORDER FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO TAKE

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:26.390
PLACE THE TENANT AND THE

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:28.292
LANDLORD MUST BOTH APPLY FOR

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:30.127
THE PROGRAM IS THAT CORRECT.

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.696
THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND SET

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.665
THE TENANT CHOOSES NOT TO.

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:36.233
APPLY THEN THE LANDLORD DOES

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.401

IS CORRECT. OKAY- SO THE SECOND

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:48.312
QUESTION IS- OVER THE LAST YEAR

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:51.015
IT'S I THINK THE ESTIMATE WAS

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:53.350
SIX UNDER NINETEEN MILLION WAS

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:55.986
REQUESTED- IN REIMBURSEMENT

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:58.189
FUNDS AND OF THAT SIX HUNDRED

00:40:58.255 --> 00:41:00.591
NINETEEN MILLION THE STATE HAS

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:03.194
PAID OUT. 80% OF THOSE FUNDS SO

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.363
WHAT IS IN THIS BILL TO INSURE

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:10.067

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.940
EMBARRASSING 8% OVER THE LAST

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:18.242
YEAR HAS BEEN PAID OUT SO. HOW

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.543
DO WE ENSURE THAT THAT'S NOT

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.412
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS-

00:41:21.478 --> 00:41:23.214
EXTENSION OF THE MORATORIUM AN

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.016
ADDITIONAL FUNDS THINKING.

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:29.019
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE 8%

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:31.488
REPRESENTS OR THE PERCENTAGE-

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:32.823
AND I DON'T I CREEK QUITE

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.291
FRANKLY TO REMEMBER C. 8%

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:35.726
REPRESENTS THIS THE PART THAT

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:37.361
THE STATE IS ADMINISTERING

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:38.696
APART FROM THE STATE

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:41.332
ADMINISTRATION. THE BIG CITIES

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:43.067
AND THE BIGGER COUNTIES WERE

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:44.702
GIVEN A DIRECT ALLOCATION FROM

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:46.804
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:48.939
DATA WE DON'T IS NOT INCLUDED

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:50.374
IN THAT PERCENTAGE THAT YOU

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:53.010
QUOTED AND SO- THEY ARE DOING

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:54.778
THEIR OWN PROGRAMS. I'M A

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:56.413
COUPLE OF THE COUNTIES HAVE AND

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.082
MAYBE MORE THAN A COUPLE HAVE

00:41:58.148 --> 00:41:59.350
ELECTED TO PAY UP TO A HUNDRED

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.253
PERCENT. OF THE PAST DUE RENT

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:04.588
AND- AND SO THERE'S ARE A

00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:06.891
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT AS AS

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:08.926
FAR AS THE STATE PROCESS HAS

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:11.061
GONE- THE NUMBERS ARE ARE ARE

00:42:11.128 --> 00:42:13.097
FAIRLY FAIRLY SMALL AND SO

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:14.698
WE'VE BEEN VERY CRITICAL. OF

00:42:14.765 --> 00:42:16.834
THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE'VE

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.903
ASKED THAT THEY EXPEDITE THEIR

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:21.038
THEIR APPLICATION PROCESS THAT

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:23.240
IT BECOME MUCH SIMPLER. AND

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:25.342
THAT THEY ENGAGE THE LANDLORD

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:27.344
COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:28.512
SURE THAT THE LANDLORDS ARE

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:29.546
PARTICIPATING AS WELL BECAUSE

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:30.948
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S PART

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:32.616
OF BEING PART OF THE ISSUE.

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:35.519
WITH WITH THE ALLOCATION OF-

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.288

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:38.222
GOT A COMMITMENT FROM THE

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:39.556
ADMINISTRATION THAT- THE

00:42:39.623 --> 00:42:41.458
PROCESS IS GOING TO MOVE FASTER

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:42.993
AND THAT PART THAT WE CAN

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.730
CONTROL WILL BE- THE PART THAT

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:47.865
WE SEE THE DATA ON. THANK YOU

MAKES IS EXTENDED TO SEPTEMBER

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.350
NOT THE ALLOCATION OF THE

RESOURCES WE HAVE THE

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:09.453

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:47.558
OF THE PROCESS HAS BEEN- HAS

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:49.593
BEEN EXPRESSED FOR SOME TIME

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.861
BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THE MONEY

FAST ENOUGH AND IT'S MY

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:54.665
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:55.532

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:57.534
WORKED ON THE ON THE REDESIGN

00:43:57.601 --> 00:43:59.269
OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND

EXPECTATION. THAT ONCE THIS

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:05.509

WE'RE ACTIVELY MOVING THIS

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:09.413
QUICKLY- RATHER THAN WAITING%

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.481
UNTIL AUGUST IS BECAUSE WE

00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:11.315

PRESENT I WANT TO. ADD A COUPLE

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:32.036
OF POINTS GIVEN THE DISCUSSIONS

00:44:32.102 --> 00:44:33.604
THAT WAS RAISED FIRST OF ALL.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.272
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THE

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:36.673
SECRETARY OF TREASURY HAS

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:37.841
CHANGED THE GUIDANCE WITH

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:38.876
RESPECT TO HOW THIS PROGRAM

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.677
OPERATED BEFORE. AND HOW IT

00:44:40.744 --> 00:44:42.246
OPERATES NOW. THERE'S AN

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:43.781
ABILITY TO SELF CERTIFY WHICH

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.749
HAS MADE IT A LOT EASIER FOR

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:47.284
THE MECHANICS OF THE PROGRAM TO

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:49.119
OPERATE SECOND. THIS IS THE

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:51.021
MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT UNDER THE

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:53.624
PREVIOUS RULES THE LANDLORD HAD

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.492
TO ACCEPT EIGHTY PERCENT. THE

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:57.561
GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF LAW IS

00:44:57.628 --> 00:44:59.430
THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A CONTRACT

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:01.098
YOU CAN'T IMPAIR THE CONTRACT

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:02.933
AND ASK THE LANDLORD TO ACCEPT

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.135
LESS THAN. A HUNDRED CENTS ON

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:06.036
THE DOLLAR UNLESS YOU

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:07.337
INCENTIVIZE AND THAT'S WHAT WE

HAVE TAX INCENTIVES AND ALL

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.274
SORTS OF PROGRAMS TO

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.275
INCENTIVIZE CERTAIN LEVELS OF

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:13.444
BEHAVIOR. BUT WHEN YOU PAY A

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.179
100% WHICH IS NOW THE CONTENT

00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:17.181
OF THIS MEASURE THE ENTIRE

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:18.315
MECHANISM OF THE PROCESS

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.919
CHANGES. BECAUSE IF I GO TO-

00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:23.654
SAY THE PRO TEM AND I SAY

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.688

THAT THE PRO TEM LET ME THE-MONEY THE LANDLORD WAS PAY

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:33.630
DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU GET

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:35.432
THE MONEY FROM. CHANGE THE

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:37.267
RULES DRAMATICALLY AND ALLOWS

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:38.735

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:42.372
WHICH REQUIRE SELF ATTESTATION

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:44.541

EXTENSIVELY LONG DOCUMENT THAT

00:50:51.581 --> 00:50:53.083
PRECLUDED SOME PEOPLE FROM

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.984
FEELING LIKE THEY COULD

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.118
ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN A

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:56.453
PROGRAM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.155
THESE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE

00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:00.123
ADMINISTRATION. SO THERE IS A

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.092
BALANCING ACT BETWEEN MAKING

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:04.027
SURE THAT THE FORM IS SUCH THAT

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:06.496
PEOPLE USE IT- THAT THE

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.497
LANDLORDS ARE GONE AND THEN

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.266
ALSO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:11.768

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:12.602
TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT THE

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:14.404
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO AVOID

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:16.673
ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE WE ARE

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.241

CALIFORNIA AND MEET ALL OF-THESE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS SO

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:24.314
WHEN WE SAID ONCE BEFORE THAT

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:25.282
WE WERE GOING TO HAVE WORK TO

00:51:25.348 --> 00:51:27.017
DO WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.585
TO HAVE CONTINUED WORK TO DO TO

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:30.020
GET DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:30.821
PEOPLE WHO NEEDED THE

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.656
RESOURCES. SO THAT THEY CAN

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.257
KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS SO

00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:36.126
THAT LANDLORDS COULD BE PAID.

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:38.829
SMALL LANDLORDS- AND SO I

00:51:38.895 --> 00:51:41.364
THINK. I UNDERSTAND THE NATURE

00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:43.967
OF THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:44.901
BECAUSE CLEARLY WE WANT THESE

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:46.470

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.074
POSSIBLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:52.976
NEEDS. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.044
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.545
WORK HERE BECAUSE SHOULD THIS

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.214
PROGRAM STILL BE CUMBERSOME OR

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.949
WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THE

00:51:59.015 --> 00:51:59.816
DOLLARS OUT IN A TIMELY

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:02.018
FASHION. WE'VE COMMITTED AS

00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:03.487
PART OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THE

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:05.155
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND A AND

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.858
THE- ASSEMBLY. THAT WE MAY HAVE

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:09.559
MORE WORK TO DO IN FACT THE

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:10.861
MAJORITY LEADER HAS

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.362
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:15.398

SURE WE DON'T MISS A DEADLINE-

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:21.371
THAT IS UPON US AND THAT PEOPLE

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:22.305
DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:24.207
RESOURCES AND THEN THINK

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:25.208
THERE'S NO PROGRAMMING OR

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:28.044

ENORMOUS SOMETIMES IT EBBS AND

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:42.024
FLOWS. BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:44.526

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:45.894
THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH SECURITY

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:48.530

NOT BE INCARCERATING EVERYBODY

01:12:58.373 --> 01:12:58.874
WILL WANT AT THIS END GAMES

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:02.544
HERE. IS TO ENSURE THAT IN THE

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:04.113

INCREASE IN SENTENCING IN ANY

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:10.319
WAY. THERE WON'T BE ANY ROOM AT

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:11.820
THE END NOW THAT'S A LITTLE

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.255
SUBTLE GOAL OF SOME OF THE

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:15.591
PROPONENTS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK WITHIN

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:23.632
THE INSTITUTIONS. IT IS A RISKY

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:26.368
BUSINESS. IT IS A DEPRESSING

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:29.404
BUSINESS. I HAD TO WONDER

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.673
MYSELF HOW I WAS ABLE TO GO

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.009

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.044
OF BAD DREAMS ABOUT WHAT I

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:36.578
EXPERIENCED DURING THE DAY

01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:40.382

FOR THE INMATES WITHIN THE

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.452
INSTITUTION. BUT MOST ASSUREDLY

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:44.853
THOSE WHO ARE THERE FOR

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.856
STUDENTS. AND THOSE WHO DO THE

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.558
HELP FOR THOSE INMATES

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.627
PROVIDING THEM REHABILITATIVE

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:53.796
OPPORTUNITIES. THIS IS A TOUGH

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:56.298
LEAGUE AND THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:58.734

CORRECT CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:08.744
WORK IN A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT. A

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:09.812
DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:10.679
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE IN

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:12.147
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:15.017
AND CLOCKS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:18.420
THOSE THAT THEY GUARD MAINTAIN-

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:20.856
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE. THEY HAVE

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:23.025
DANGERS THAT THAT WE DON'T FACE

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:24.326
FOR EXAMPLE DANGERS WITH

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.395
RESPECT TO COVE IN NINETEEN.

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:27.663
ARE THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.298
DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:31.066
THOSE WHO DECLINED TO BE

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.035
VACCINATED WE CAN DO SO THEY

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.703
CAN'T NECESSARILY DISASSOCIATE

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:35.871
THEMSELVES FROM THOSE OF THE

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.673
REQUIRED TO GUARD. AND AS A

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.041
CONSEQUENCE I BELIEVE THERE'S

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.742
BEEN TWENTY EIGHT CORRECTIONAL

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.010

TWENTY SEVEN INMATES HAVE DIED

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.584
FROM COVERT NINETEEN- HOWEVER.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.986

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:52.821
OF THOSE WHO ARE CORRECTIONAL

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:54.690
OFFICERS HAVE BEEN VACCINATED.

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:56.692
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. YOU

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:58.660
KNOW THIS WATER IS NOW GONE

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.562
BEYOND THE BRIDGE. BUT I'M

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:02.431
HOPEFUL THAT IN THE FUTURE WHEN

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:04.433
WE ENCOUNTER THIS KIND OF

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.701
CRISIS THAT THAT WE CAN DO

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:07.636
SOMETHING TO INCENTIVIZE THOSE

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:08.871
OR IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:12.608
CAN BE DONE- POST. ADOPTION MO

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:13.876

PRISON- CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS

TO DO SO THAT THAT I WOULD

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.448
ENCOURAGE US TO CREATE THOSE

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:20.849
INCENTIVES TO MAKE SURE THAT

CONTEXT AS WE DEAL WITH THIS

01:58:55.728 --> 01:58:57.196
EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE OF

01:58:57.263 --> 01:58:59.265
PUTTING TOGETHER THIS BUDGET

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:00.766
DOCUMENT WHICH GUIDES

A ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:21.554
PACKAGE. BUT THE PACKAGE. WAS

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:24.724
ABOUT ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WE DID

01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:27.159
NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE WOULD

01:59:27.226 --> 01:59:30.129
BRING. THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT

01:59:30.196 --> 01:59:32.398
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THIS

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:35.101
GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF HOW OUR

01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:37.537
BUDGET WORKS. THE MAYOR OF

01:59:37.603 --> 01:59:39.305
SACRAMENTO FORMER P. T. WAS

01:59:39.372 --> 01:59:40.873
HERE WHEN THERE WAS SIXTY

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:43.042
BILLION DOLLAR DEFICITS BY TWO

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:44.310
OF MY HISTORY BEING HERE

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:45.778
EXTRAORDINARY DEFICITS WHAT

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:47.780
DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS IT'S A

01:59:47.847 --> 01:59:49.649
HORTON SERVICES ARE CUT OFF IT

01:59:49.715 --> 01:59:51.117
MEANS EMPLOYEES ARE FURLOUGHED

01:59:51.183 --> 01:59:52.952
IT MEANS THAT THE COST OF

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:54.720
RESTARTING IS EXTRAORDINARY WE

01:59:54.787 --> 01:59:57.490
HAVE THIS UNBELIEVABLY VOLATILE

01:59:57.557 --> 02:00:00.159
SYSTEM. AND HERE WE FACE

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:01.694
BETWEEN THE FEDERAL DOLLARS

02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:03.496
THAT WE HAVE AND THE

02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:07.633
UNBELIEVABLE UNEXPECTED DOLLARS

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:09.402
THAT WE HAVE IN CAPITAL GAINS.

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:12.438
CRAZY AMOUNT OF MONEY. IT'S SO

02:00:12.505 --> 02:00:13.539
FROM SOMEONE WITH MY

02:00:13.606 --> 02:00:15.174
PERSPECTIVE WHAT I'M INTERESTED

02:00:15.241 --> 02:00:16.742
IN IS IN ADDITION TO

02:00:16.809 --> 02:00:17.910
SUPPLEMENTING SO MANY OF THE

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:19.211
SERVICES AND PROVIDING AND

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:20.613
FIXING SO MANY OF THE HOLES

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.048
THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET WHAT

02:00:22.114 --> 02:00:23.916
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS A

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:25.484
RESPONSIBLE BUDGET FOR THE LONG

02:00:25.551 --> 02:00:28.988
TERM. TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO

02:00:29.055 --> 02:00:31.857
BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES.

02:00:31.924 --> 02:00:32.892
TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION.

02:00:32.959 --> 02:00:34.226
IN THE OLD DAYS WE JUST HAD A

02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:35.995
SMALL MAYBE A BILLION DOLLAR

02:00:36.062 --> 02:00:36.896
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS REMEMBER

02:00:36.963 --> 02:00:38.931
THIS A- SENATOR IN THE OLD DAYS

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:40.800
WE HAD A SMALL DOLLAR RESERVE.

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:42.935
UNDER THE A BUDGET. THAT WAS

02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:45.037
REQUIRED NOW WE HAVE FOUR FOR

02:00:45.104 --> 02:00:46.339
RESERVES WE HAVE ASSOCIATE WE

02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:47.673
HAVE ONE FOR SOCIAL SAFETY NET.

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:50.710
EDUCATION THE BIG RAINY DAY

02:00:50.776 --> 02:00:52.311
FUND PLUS THE RESERVE ACCOUNT.

02:00:52.378 --> 02:00:54.046
UNPRECEDENTED BUT WHY IS THAT

02:00:54.113 --> 02:00:56.048
NECESSARY. BECAUSE IT'S

02:00:56.115 --> 02:00:58.250
RESPONSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO THINK

02:00:58.317 --> 02:01:00.219
LONG TERM TO PROTECT AGAINST

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:02.922
THE VOLATILITY THAT WE FACE AND

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:05.124
THE IMPACT IT HAS EVERYWHERE.

02:01:05.191 --> 02:01:06.692
WE HAVE PAID DOWN MY FIRST WHEN

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:08.327
I WAS GOING GOVERNMENT BEFORE.

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:09.862
WE HAD WITHIN WEEKS OF MY

02:01:09.929 --> 02:01:12.231

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:20.473
PROCESS. TO BE ABLE TO AS WE GO

02:01:20.539 --> 02:01:21.674
FORWARD AND HAVE THIS

02:01:21.741 --> 02:01:23.709
VOLATILITY TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:25.978
PREPARED FOR THAT. PAYING DOWN

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:29.215
DEBT HUGE RESERVES FORTY THREE

02:01:29.281 --> 02:01:29.782
BILLION DOLLARS I THINK THE

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:32.885
NUMBER WAS. A ONE TIME REVENUES

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:33.986
FIXING A LOT OF UNDERLYING

02:01:34.053 --> 02:01:36.956
PROBLEMS. BUT DOING IT IN A WAY

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:39.625
THAT UNDERSTANDS THE LONG TERM

02:01:39.692 --> 02:01:42.595
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. IN

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:45.364
