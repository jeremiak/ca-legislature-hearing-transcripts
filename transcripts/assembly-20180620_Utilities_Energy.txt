RUNNING JUST A LITTLE BIT LATE TODAY AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE THEIR NUMBER OF MULTI TASKING THAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN. VARIOUS COMMITTEES AND MAKING PRESENTATIONS AND THEN SHARING OR PARTICIPATING AND OTHERS -- BUT WE LIKE TO AT LEAST -- WRECK WELCOME A SENATOR WINNER -- TO MAKE HIS PRESENTATION. TO US AS A SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THIS MOMENT ON SB. SEVEN HUNDRED MY APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY. VELVET NEMESIS HERE. OKAY IT AND LET ME JUST IF I COULD -- FOR PURPOSES OF HOUSEKEEPING EVEN THOUGH SHE IS NOT HERE -- PRESENTLY I MISS FRIEDMAN WILL BE SITTING IN TODAY. A TO FILL THE VACANCY ON OUR COMMITTEE ON OUR COMMITTEE. AND THAT WE HAVE -- UNDER HOUSEKEEPING WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONSIDER BILLS THAT ARE ON CONSENT. ITEM NUMBER THREE SB TEND. TO ITEM SIX S. B. ELEVEN THIRTY SIX HERTZBERG. ITEM SEVEN S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT HUESO. ITEM NINE S. B. THIRTEEN SEVENTY FOUR HUESO WITH AMENDMENTS. ITEM TEN S. B. FOURTEEN TEN MORALE. AND SO WITH THAT. DURING WINTER YOU'RE ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOT MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT SETBACK THANK YOU YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE BILL. I AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AYE AMENDMENTS CONTAINED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THANK YOU FOR THAT. OUGHT COLLEAGUES US SENATE BILL SEVEN HUNDRED OF WILL HELP CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE MARKET TRANSFORMATION OPT FOR THE SMALL SCALE BEHIND THE METER STORAGE. ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY -- BY EXTENDING A CRITICAL INCENTIVE -- PROGRAM FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES. ODD DISTRIBUTED STORAGE RESOURCES ARE A CRITICAL -- TO ADDRESSING THE MID DAY SURPLUS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CALLED COURSE THE TUCKER -- WHERE WE ARE PRODUCING A LOT OF SOLO DURING THE DAY -- AND THEN USING A LOT OF IT AT NIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS NO LONGER. A SHINING AND SO WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE. URGES NOT FLOWING BACK INTO THE GRID AND SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT TAPPING INTO AYE PICKER PLANT ENERGY ON THE RETURN HOME AT NIGHT. AIDID'S -- BEHIND THE METER STORAGE SYSTEMS CAN PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RESILIENCY. TODD DURING TIMES OF WILDFIRE OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS I WOULD TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS MAY BE SEVERED OR POWERED DOWN. ARE UNFORTUNATELY THE ITSELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM OR ASK SHIP. WHICH HAS BEEN A CRUCIAL DRIVER OF GROWTH IN THE STORAGE MARKET. IS SET TO EXPIRE -- ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH REVENUE COLLECTION ENDING A YEAR EARLIER -- THAN THAT I SUCH A SCENARIO IS PROJECTED OUGHT TO LEAD TO ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE CAPACITY INSTALLED ON THE PROGRAM WHICH IS FAR LESS. AND WHAT WE NEED TO BRING THE MARKET THE SCALE. AYE SO ARE. WE KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS WORK IT'S WORKED OUT WITH ROOFTOP SOLAR -- IT IS WORKING ON WILL WORK I WITH A STORAGE SYSTEMS. AND THE SB SEVEN HUNDRED BY EXTENDING THE ESTA PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE A CRITICAL NOTS CERTAINTY ONTO THE ENERGY STORAGE INDUSTRY. ARE A MINISTRY I THAT WE NEED -- UNDER A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION ABOUT CHIP WITH BOTH IN THE BILL OF THE PROGRAM CAN GENERATE AS MANY AS TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONAL MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE. WHILE DRIVING PRICE REDUCTIONS IN BOTH TECHNOLOGY AND HARD WORK COSTS AS WELL AS SOFT COSTS SUCH AS INSTALLATION PERMITTING CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT. I MEAN WELL AS CHIP WILL CONTINUE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LOWER ENERGY DEMAND. IMPROVE GREAT RELIABILITY AND FOSTER THE GROWTH OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. AND PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S VERY -- POSITIVE FOR OUR RECENT DECISION TO REQUIRE A SOLAR ON NEARLY ALL NEW ROOF TOPS S. B. SEVEN HUNDRED WILL ALLOW CUSTOMERS BUY TO USE -- SELF GENERATED SOLAR POWER AYE DURING PEAK HOURS ARE RATHER THAN RELYING ON UTILITY ELECTRICITY WHICH WILL SAVE MONEY -- AND AVOID -- OTHER -- CHALLENGES -- SO WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE OUT BERNADETTE DEL CHARO OF THE CALIFORNIA SO A SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION. AND THEN JACOB SAN OF ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE. I THINK YOU UP MY NAME IS PART OF THAT DON'T YOU ARE ONLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION. OF WHERE THE LARGEST CLEAN ENERGY A BUSINESS ASSOCIATION AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED OF MEMBER COMPANIES THAT ARE INSTALLING MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTING. AT SOLAR AND ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANNA THANK THE CHAIR A AND A STAFFER WORKING. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR SUPPORT. AND OF COURSE WE WANT THINK ARE AUTHORED -- FOR HELPING CHAMPION THIS ISSUE SB SEVEN HUNDRED IS URGENTLY NEEDED. OF FOR CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR INDUSTRY IN OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. IT ALSO PROVIDES THREE CRITICAL BENEFITS TO ALL RATEPAYERS AND WANT TO BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT. FIRST OF ALL MULTI YEAR AND SENT TO PROGRAMS LIKE WITH THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND. WORK IN TERMS OF DRIVING DOWN PRICES FOR CONSUMERS. WE KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE. THAT THE PRICE OF SOLAR DECLINE TENURE PROGRAM. WHILE DRIVING UP DEMAND AND IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS CONTINUED LONG AFTER THE REBATES SUNSET. PACIFIC LEYVA PAST TWO YEARS CALIFORNIA SOLAR MARKET HAS TRIPLED. IT'S THE END OF THE REBATES. AND PRICES HAVE CONTINUED DECLINE WE WOULD EXPECT A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA WITH ENERGY STORAGE SHOULD SB SEVEN HUNDRED ASS. SECONDLY DISTRIBUTE ENERGY RESOURCES SAVE ALL RATEPAYERS MONEY. JUST THIS PAST MARCH CAL I SO ANNOUNCED THAT DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES STABS SAVED RATEPAYERS TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND REDUCED NEED FOR UP TRANSMISSION UPGRADES. IS A REAL VALUE FOR ALL RATEPAYERS AND THESE ARE THE TYPES OF ADDITIONAL VALUES AND SAVINGS THAT ENERGY STORAGE DEPLOYED AS SUCH AS ENVISIONED BY SB SEVEN HUNDRED WILL CONTINUE TO BRING ALL RATEPAYERS. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST ENERGY STORAGE MAKES OUR GREAT MORE RESILIENT ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS SUCH AS THE WILDFIRES. AS YOU THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE IF WE ARE SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO DEPLOY MORE ENERGY STORAGE AND PAIRED WITH SOLAR SYSTEMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE CAN AT TIMES OF HIGH WIND EVENTS FOR EXAMPLE DEPOWER -- VULNERABLE TRANS I'D JUST IN LIGHTS ON FOR ARE CRITICAL -- TO AT FACILITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND ACTUALLY HELP PREVENT SOME OF THESE FIRES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. US WITHOUT I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE -- AGAIN OUR THANKS AYE TO THAT THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT -- THIS IS CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINING THE JOBS THAT WE PROVIDE THROUGHOUT THE STATE GIVING CONSUMER MORE CHOICE AND HELPING CALIFORNIA -- BUILDUP CLEANER GREENER GRAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU BEFORE WE TAKE OUR NEXT WITNESS WE'RE GOING. TO A TURN THERE ARE -- COMMITTEE SECRETARY FOR A ROLL CALL WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO LET'S. TAKE THE ROLE. HOLDEN. PRESENT [inaudible] PATTERSON [inaudible] BURKE [inaudible] GEN [inaudible] CUNNINGHAM [inaudible] EGGMAN. GALLAGHER. EDUARDO GARCIA [inaudible] MAYES [inaudible] MURATSUCHI [inaudible] QUIRK YOUR REYES SANTIAGO FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS DAN JACOBSON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO WHAT THE SENATOR. AND KELSEY YEAH CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORAGE HAS BEEN SAYING FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU TO YOUR LEADERSHIP. IS NOT JUST THIS BILL BUT THE CONCEPT OF MOVING US TOWARD A THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE CRITICAL PIECES THAT GET US THERE I KNOW WILL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN LATER BUT I THINK YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THE CONVERSATION. AWAY FROM A SINGLE BILL AND LOOK AT IT AS A WHOLE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOUR STAFF FOR BEING ABLE TO TO SORT OF PUT A PAUSE ON THING TAKE A BIGGER LOOK AT THINGS AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO. I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT S. B. SEVEN HUNDRED IN PARTICULAR IS CRITICAL FOR BEING ABLE TO GET US TO THAT 1100% GOAL THAT WE'RE LOOKING. FOR IT IT DOES IS THE SENATOR HAS ALREADY SAID. ALLOWS US TO USE THE EXCESS SOLAR CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE DURING THE DAY TO BE ABLE TO THEN USE THAT IN THE EVENING INSTEAD OF HAVING OUR HOME SURE OUR BUSINESSES. LOCK IN TWO PETER PLANTS AND THAT'S GONNA BE ONE OF THE CRITICAL THINGS THAT WE NEED NOT ONLY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT. BUT I THINK JUST AS IMPORTANT TO REDUCE. AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION HAS AGAIN COME OUT WITH THEIR LIST CALIFORNIA TOPS THAT LIST SIX OUT OF THE TOP TEN CITIES IN THERE ARE FROM CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN. TO HELP REDUCE THAT AIR POLLUTION BILLS LIKE THIS ARE A CRITICAL PIECE. THE SECOND THING I'LL SAY IS THAT WE NEED THIS TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED HOW SUCCESSFUL THE SOLAR ROOFS PROGRAM IS BEEN A MILLION SOLDIERS PROGRAM. HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL AT HELPING TO GET SOLAR PANELS OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE AND THE THIRD REASON THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS IS THERE'S A 25% OF THIS. IS MADE SURE THAT IT'S GOING TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THIS TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION. IS 21100% OF CALIFORNIANS IN THAT NO ONE IS LEFT OUT WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SCOTT MURDER SAW I'M WORKING AS A CONSULTANT TO THE CALIFORNIAN. SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION -- PRIOR TO WORKING FOR KELSO.

NO I MEAN THEY ARE NOT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF VOTE SOLAR AS SOMEONE IS A MEMBER OF BUT SOLAR AND THEY'RE IN SUPPORT. EXPECTS WITH MYERS SOLAR AND IT'S ON SOLAR IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL [inaudible] IN. I NEED TO MAKE A LITTLE ROOM THERE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. ISRAEL SALAS WITH OF SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY -- FIRST WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL. OB UNFORTUNATELY EVEN AS THE EYES PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED WE STILL MUST REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL. WE SUPPORT THE GOALS OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE SUPPORT THE ROLE THAT ENERGY STORAGE CAN PLAY -- WHERE IT MAKES SENSE AND WHERE IT'S COST EFFECTIVE UNFORTUNATELY WE DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE -- SOME OF THE CHARACTERIZATIONS ABOUT HOW THE STORAGE DEVICES ARE BEING USED TODAY. OUT WE BELIEVE THAT ACCORDING. TWO AND I TRUMP STUDY THAT WAS RELEASED OUT WHICH MEASURES AND EVALUATES THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE BATTERIES AS A RESULT OF THE AFTER PROGRAM WHAT THEY HAVE SHOWN IS THAT IT INCREASING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NOT DECREASING. WE AGREE THAT CHARGING THE BATTERY PACKS DURING THE MID DAY WHEN SOLDIERS PLENTIFUL IS A GOOD IDEA. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CHARGING DURING THE SYSTEM PEAK IS A GOOD IDEA BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE OPPOSITE -- DISCHARGING OR CHARGING DURING DURING THE PEAK AND DISCHARGING -- IT DURING DAYS WHEN SO WHERE IS PLENTIFUL SO UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL -- WE CAN SEE SOME MEANINGFUL CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE. RAPE PARA BENEFIT SEALED IT'S ALL OF OUR RATEPAYERS OUT WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS ACTIVE ENOUGH FLEMING'S ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY -- WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL WHAT IT TO WHAT IS IN PRINT TODAY AYE WE DO NEED TO GO BACK AND REEVALUATE OF THE AMENDMENTS GIVEN THE AUTHORS ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW LANGUAGE -- BUT WE WOULD I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER AND KEEP A WATCHFUL EYE ON ENSURING GREAT CARE FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE SG IP WILL BE SPENT PRUDENT LEAD TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT FOR ALL UTILITY CUSTOMERS AND NOT JUST. OF THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS SO WE WILL BE TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE BILL -- AND IF IT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD -- IF WE HAVE TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT WE MAY HAVE. CHAIRMAN NURSE REBECCA LEE ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WE TO HAVE A REGISTER OPPOSED POSITION BASED ON THE BILL IMPRINTS WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT'S A SEPARATE TODAY -- WE ARE ALSO REALLY REASSESSING OUR POSITIONING -- BUT ONE THING TO A WE WOULD LIKE THIS BODY TO ON BE MINDFUL OF IS AS WE CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM THAT WE MAKE SURE THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR THE SYSTEMS A PROPERLY REFLECT THE LEVEL OF MARK. KIT TRANSFORMATION WE SEE THAT AND SEE AND THE SECTOR FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE INITIATIVE PROGRAM DOES INCENTIVES WERE SET DOWN AS THE MARKET. A SOLAR MATURED SO WE WOULD EXPECT PASSED THE STORAGE MARKET MATURES THAT THESE INCENTIVES ARE ADJUSTED AND REEVALUATE IT APPROPRIATELY -- TO MAKE SURE THAT RATE PER FUNDS ARE SIMPLE SPENDS MOST PARTLY AS A ASK RESPONSIBILITY AS RESPONSIBLE AS POSSIBLE -- WITH THAT -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. SO WILL ACCEPT THOSE WHO ARE HERE TO US -- LYNN THEIR OPPOSITION WITH NAME AND AFFILIATION. MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SCOTT WHICH WOULD STAY ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. I AND THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION AND WE OF OUR IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU. IS THERE ANYONE HERE -- TO WHO HAS A POSITION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYSON TO MEMBERS OF DOCTOR QUIRK [inaudible] BOB. SO I KNOW ALONE BUT NOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THIS INDUSTRY AND AT FIRST I SAY I DID. I WAS THE DECIDING VOTE TO REJECT AN EARLIER I'M GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THE BILL THIS TIME. ALL AN EARLIER VERSION WHICH EXPANDED THE PROGRAM. THIS IS SIMPLY CONTINUING THE PROGRAM [inaudible] AND WE AS A STATE BAYLOR COMMITMENT AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY WORKING VERY HARD RIGHT NOW. AND WE DO NOT WANT TO BREAK FAITH WITH THOSE PEOPLE. SO EXTENDING THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS ALWAYS TAKE LONGER THAN YOU THINK. TIM. MAKES A LOT OF SAN AND WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. I CAN FULLY SUPPORT THIS -- EDITION BROUGHT UP A TRUE FACT. WHICH IS THAT. BECAUSE OF THE CRAZY WAY WE SET RATES. NAMELY THAT A COMPANY IS CHARGED ON ITS MAXIMUM USE EVEN IF IT'S A TIME WHEN THERE'S PLENTY OF ENERGY. COMPANIES ARE DOING THE WRONG THING. ARE THE P. UC IS LOOKING AT THIS I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL CORRECT IT. YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT A NUDGE IN YOUR BILL FOR THEM TO DO THAT. AB THAT'LL BRING THE OPPOSITION OFF. BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT BEING DONE RIGHT NOW THE P. YOU SEE IS VERY AWARE OF THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE FIXED. IN THE MEANTIME. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP FAITH WITH THE PROGRAM THAT WE DO OUR PART AND IT'S TRUE WE DID OUR PART IN SOLAR HERE IN THE U. S.. PEOPLE WERE DOING THEIR PART AROUND THE WORLD IN GERMANY AND CHINA. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES DOING THIS WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO WILL BE PUSHING THIS MARKET WE WILL HAVE COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD. WE HOWEVER NEED TO DO OUR SHARE SO I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE I BLOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS YES WITH THE AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE WONDERFUL. YEAH I'D AND FOR THE RECORD I I MISSED THE BEGINNING. BUT WE REFERRING TO THE AMENDMENTS AND SECTION ONE PARAGRAPHS BNC HERE WHAT FOR THE RECORD WHERE THE AMENDMENTS. THESE ARE THE A MENACE THAT ARE ATTACHED -- PAGE. SEVEN THE BILL WAS ANALYZE BECAUSE PROPOSED TO TO BE AMENDMENTS. TO IT WITH UNITS OKAY A AND THEN BUT I GUESS MY OTHER COMMENT IS IS A ALONG THE LINES OF OF MICHAEL THE DOCTOR QUIRK AROUND. I DO THINK WE NEED SOME KIND OF WAY TO DO SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND TIME OF USE AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE USING THE BATTERY -- BUT I KNOW ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE THE THE NEW THINGS ARE DOING WITH TAG AND AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. THEM. HOW WE HOW WE USE OUR OUR RESOURCES THE MOST EFFECTIVELY -- AND AGAIN WITH EXPANSION THIS PROGRAM AND IN JUST AT THE CLARIFICATION I I BELIEVE THIS WORKS VERY WELL WITH THAT A. B.. SIX AND THREE THAT WE DID LAST YEAR AMOUNTS OR FOR LOW INCOME AND AT 25% AND BE ABLE TO BE USED. FOR AB DOESN'T IT MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS USING SOME THE SORT THEN CAN ALSO. HAVE ACCESS TO THE BATTERY. RIGHT. IT IN AGAIN ALONG WITH LINES WITH A DOCTOR QUICKLY SAYING IT WOULD BE VERY NICE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF GUARDRAILS AROUND TIMES ABUSE AND BEING OF THE USE. THE POWER IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER TO BE ABLE TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'VE TWO QUESTIONS AND SORT OF A COMET. I WAS WONDERING IF SOMEBODY COULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN JUST COMMENTED ON WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE. THIS CHARGING OUT OF THEIR STORAGE. NOT AT NIGHTTIME WHEN IN A PRODUCTION OF SELLERS GONE ZERO BUT AT OTHER TIMES IN THE DAY WHETHER. THAT'S BEEN STUDIED IS THAT. ACCURATE IS THAT NOT ACCURATE WHAT SORT OF GOING. THE OTHER THERE TWO ELEMENTS OF THAT THAT ARE DRIVING THAT CHARGING AND DISCHARGING BEHAVIORS ONE IS. THAT WE HAVE THESE WATER OFTEN REFERRED HIS LEGACY TIME OF USE PERIODS. BECAUSE BEFORE WE HAD THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR ON THE GRID THE PEAK. I AM INTERVIEWS OCCURRED GENERALLY FROM TWELVE PM TO SIX PM. AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT TOOK YEARS FOR THE P.. AND THE VARIOUS RATE CASES TO MOVE FROM THOSE LEGACY PERIODS TO THE NEW TIME OF USE PERIODS THE PEAKS. THAT REFLECT A ALL THAT ABUNDANT SOLAR ON THE GRID MID DAY SO THE PAPER IS AN HOUR JOHN TO BE MOVED TO THREE TO EIGHT FOUR NINE SOMEWHERE THAT TIME FRAME. I THINK THAT WILL START TO SEND THE RIGHT PRICE SIGNAL TO CUSTOMERS. AND THE OTHER WHICH IS WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK WAS REFERRING TO ARE THESE WHAT ARE CALLED NON COINCIDENT DEMAND CHARGES CHARGING CUSTOMERS FOR THE HIGHEST USE IT REGARDLESS OF ONE OF THE CARS. AND THAT IS. THAT IS A RATE ELEMENT THAT IS ACTIVELY UNDER CONSIDERATION AND YOU SEE OF THE SUBJECT OF OUR A FORM THAT THEY HAD IN DECEMBER TO LOOK AT REFORMING NON RESIDENTIAL RATE DESIGN MORE BROADLY SO I WOULD EXPECT SOME MOVEMENT THERE. TO MOVING AWAY FROM THOSE KINDS OF DEMAND CHARGES AND PUSHING MORE THE REVENUE COLLECTION AND THE PERIOD. THE NEW PERIOD. OKAY AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS DO YOU HAVE DATA ON WHAT. PERCENTAGE OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. OUR CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE STORAGE [inaudible] CAPABILITY. PRESENTLY AND THEN WHAT IS A PROJECTED TO BE. YOU WITH WITH THIS BILL. WELL CURRENTLY THE THE PENETRATION OF STORAGE IS STILL THAT CREDIBLY SMALL THIS IS A VERY NASCENT INDUSTRY -- AT SEVEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR THAT'S NOT EVEN COMPLETELY INSTALLED INSTALLED AND ARE IN THE PIPELINE. VERSUS THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR INSTALLED PRESENTLY -- SO THE PERCENTAGE OF EXISTING SYSTEMS WITH STORAGE IS VERY SMALL. PROBABLY NOT EVEN 1%. I'M HEARING FROM SOME MEMBER COMPANIES THAT THERE AT LEAST IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE REACHING 20% OF NEW CUSTOMERS. WHO WERE INSTALLING STORAGE ALONG WITH THEIR SOLAR SYSTEMS SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE MARKET IS BEGINNING TO TAKE OFF BUT IT WILL BE QUITE SOMETIME BEFORE IT REALLY CATCHES UP TO THE? THE SATURATION THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED WITH ROOFTOP SOLAR. IS THAT A FUNCTION OF OF COST OF THE STORAGE SYSTEM PRIMARILY. IT'S IT'S COST AND THE FACT THAT. THE THE ENTIRE STORAGE MARKET IN THE STORAGE TECHNOLOGY IS ABOUT A DECADE BEHIND SOLAR. SO I'M IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS WHEN THE CSI. THE CONFERENCE AWARENESS TO PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED FIRST IT WAS. TWO THOUSAND SIX IT WAS DESIGNED TO RUN OR FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHEN IT TOOK OVER THE PROGRAM FROM ASCAP -- THAT WAS FROM 200-072-2016. SO OUR FIRST BEGAN TO TAKE OFF AROUND 200-082-0009 IF YOU LOOK AT THE ESTA DATA EVEN THOUGH. STORAGE WAS ELIGIBLE GOING BACK TO AROUND TWENTY AROUND AROUND. TWO THOUSAND NINE TWENTY TEN IT ONLY BEGAN TO BE INSTALLED IN ANY MEANINGFUL NUMBERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT RAMP UP TO MARKET MATURITY -- WE WOULDN'T SEE. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS BILL THAT WE NEED THE BILL. WE NEED TO GET THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SOME IN THAT TIME FRAME. TO ACHIEVE A REALLY MEANINGFUL NUMBERS OF OF CUSTOMER CITED STORAGE. I JUST ADD ON TO THAT -- THAT SEVEN INJURED MEGAWATTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE PIPELINE OR INSTALLED -- ARE PRIMARILY ON A LOT AS A NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS I'M PARTICULARS WHERE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF STRONG DEMAND SO WERE. A PARENTAL AT A BENEFITS TO OUR COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE SO FAR BUT THEY WERE WERE ABOUT WHERE SALUTE WAS CIRCA TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO THAT'S WHY THIS BILL SO NEEDED. BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY IT IS OUR GOAL TO BASICALLY STOP EVERY SOLAR SYSTEM WITH PAIRED WITH A BATTERY ONCE WE CAN GET THIS MARKET OFF THE GROUND THAT THAT IS THE VISION OF WHERE WE WANT TO HEAD YEAH IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH I IT'S IT'S GOT FASTENING POTENTIAL BECAUSE I MEAN YOU. FOR THE TWO HOURS AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN I THINK THAT THE DATA SOMETHING LIKE 36% OF OUR STATEWIDE ENERGY GRIDS IMPORTED NASH NATURAL GAS. OR WHAT IS REFERRED TO SPEAKER PLANTS OR WHATEVER ELSE AND IF THERE COULD BE SATURATION ON STORAGE SO THAT ALL ROOF TOP. CUSTOMERS ARE STORING ENERGY PRODUCED WHEN THE SUN'S OUT. AND DEPLOYING IT DURING THAT TWO HOUR PERIOD I THOUGHT I SEE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL. THE TRICK TO ME IS THAT HOW DO YOU. IF YOU HAVE A SOLAR ARRAY WITHOUT A STORAGE SYSTEM AND IT COVERS A HUNDRED AND 10% OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD NEEDS -- WHAT INCENTIVE DO YOU HAVE TO BUY THAT EXTRA MODULE? STORAGE BUT MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE BILL [inaudible] THERE FAIRPOINT. YEAH IF I COULD JUST. YEAH I THINK THERE'S INTEREST FROM THE CONSUMERS E GOT UP GET THE MARKET TO MATCH THAT INTERESTING DRIVE THAT DEMAND AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID FOR SOLAR. LA AGAIN THE IT WE NEED TO MOTIVATE CONSUMERS TEND TO OFTEN OUGHT TO THIS TECHNOLOGY AND SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS FOR INTEGRATION OF RENEWABLES. OKAY I MEAN THE ONLY OTHER POINT IT OUT. BECAUSE TO NICE JOB IN ADVOCACY BUT NO ONE I THINK TOUCHED ON THE THE EMPLOYMENT ASPECT OF THE SOLAR INDUSTRY WHICH IS -- YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT ALONE THE NUMBERS I THINK THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY IN SOME CAPACITY OR ANOTHER. AND THAT'S DIRECTLY IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY NOT TO MENTION. THE FOLKS AT NAY COMMON SERVICE SAID OR TO OTHER. GO ANCILLARY THANKS SO. I'M HAPPY SUPPORT THE BILL JUST APPRECIATE CENTER BRING IT FORWARD. I BUT YOU KNOW THAT. MAYBE WE CAN TALK OFF LINE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE COST PIECE IS GOING TO BE ADDRESS BECAUSE IF IT'S THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SOMETHING. STOLEN ARRAY AND THAT COVERS A THAT'S ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND IMES MAKING NUMBERS UP IS NUMBER FIVE THOUSAND TO PUT. STORAGE UNIT THERE WELL. WHY ARE YOU GONNA SPEND THIRTY FIVE IF YOU CAN SPEND? THIRTY AND IN A SUBSIDY CERTAINLY CAN PLAY A ROLE I THINK CAN. INDUCING THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR AMONG CUSTOMERS -- BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE -- A BIT OF A CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR THE GROWTH POTENTIAL THE INDUSTRY. THAT JUST OF A QUICK RESPONSE ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN THE PC ISSUED ITS NAME TO POINT OUR DECISION. THAT -- IMPLEMENTING AB THREE TWENTY SEVEN THE THE NEW NAME TARIFF IF REQUIRED. CUSTOMERS WANTING DINNER CONNECT UNDER THEM TARA TO BE ON A TIME OF USE RATE SO WHAT IS HAPPENING INCREASINGLY AS THE TIME OF USE RATES ARE AS THE PEAKS ARE SHIFTED BACK. THOSE MIDDAY PRICES ARE PRETTY LOW. AND SO IT'S OFTEN A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB THE SOLAR NOT EXPORTED BECAUSE THEY ONLY GET CREDITED AT THE RATE IN EFFECT DURING THAT TWO WEEK PERIOD. SO THAT SO IT'S ALSO A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH IS THE POWER WORTH WHEN IT IS EXPORTED TO THE GRID. SO YOU WANT TO SAVE IT AND THEN USE IT DURING THOSE [inaudible] PEAK HOURS. THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING A LOT OF THE INTEREST IN STORAGE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DUCT WORK. AND FOR MR CUNNINGHAM -- SO I BOUGHT BATTERIES AND THE OTHER TWO THINGS ONE IS -- WE WON'T HAVE NAM RATES FOR EVER. AND SO I WAS AS USUAL I WANT TO GET OUT AHEAD OF THE CURVE. A BIT BEYOND THAT BY HAVING BATTERIES SHOULD THERE BE A POWER FAILURE FOR EARTHQUAKE WHATEVER REASON YOU'VE GOT POWER -- FOR A GOOD PERIOD OF TIME A FEW DAYS. UNTIL HOPEFULLY POWER IS RESTORED TO THE SEVERAL REASONS TO GET THEM AND I WAS. IN LINE TO GET A COUPLE OF BATTERIES UNDER. S. CHIP. SO PEOPLE DO DO IT. SENATOR WE WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR A WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND AND I'M I'M VERY PLEASED THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND -- A PATHWAY -- FOR SB SEVEN HUNDRED I KNOW THAT IS SO DOUBLE YOUR COMMITMENT TO SEE AS MANY ON THIS COMMITTEE. OF THIS AREA YEAH. GROWN AND TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE IT AND I'M EVEN MORE EFFICIENT WAY AND TO SEE MORE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF STORAGE OPPORTUNITIES AND SO WE WE'RE THANKFUL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT. TO WORK WITH AND TRY TO IDENTIFY A STRATEGY TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. AND SO WITH THAT YOU CAN -- VIXEN COMET CICLOS IF YOU'D LIKE AND I KNOW I I MIGHT ALSO AGAIN THANK YOU ARE YOU AND YOUR STAFF. FOR FOR WORKING WITH US I TOOK AWHILE BUT WE GOT THERE AND I WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OKAY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WITH THE AMENDMENTS.

WE GIVE ARE THAT THE CORDOBA OKAY WE'LL TRY. TO IF THAT GOAL OKAY SIR. PLEASE PERSONALLY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES TO PROTECT. AGAINST DAMAGE FROM STORMS FLOODS MUD SLIDES EARTHQUAKES AND WILDFIRES AS WELL AS INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES THAT WOULD SIXTH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RISK. OF IGNITING NEW WILDFIRES S. B. TENNEY WOULD REQUIRE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR UTILITIES TO PROTECT AGAINST DAMAGE. FROM A VARIETY OF NATURAL DISASTERS IT WOULD REQUIRE UTILITIES TO FILE SAFETY RELIABILITY RESILIENCY PLANTS WITH THE CPUC. PLANNED DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE CORDAY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND FIRE AGENCIES. ESTABLISHING A LOT STANDALONE SAFETY PROCEEDING WOULD REQUIRE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE CPU CD GIVE GREATER ATTENTION. A CARE TO SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. UTILITIES WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM DIVERTING MONEY FROM SAFETY RELIABILITY RESILIENCE AND PROHIBITED FROM DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS PLANT OTHERS. THE CPUC WORD REVIEW UTILITIES COMPLIANCE WITH APPROVED PLANTS IF HE'D CHILI SUBSTANTIALLY COME. PLIED WITH ITS PLANNED THE UTILITY WOULD BE DEEMED TO HAVE ACTED REASONABLY AND PRUDENTLY. IF YOU TILL THE FAILED TO SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED OR DIVERTED RESOURCES FROM A PLAN COMPLIANCE IT WOULD BE FAR I'D. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT NOTHING AN SP TO AND EIGHTY EIGHT SPEAKS TO OR CHANGES THE LAW PERTAINING THE LIABILITY OR THE APPLICATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION. TO UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES. HOWEVER THAT CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE DOES NOT REQUIRE THE CPUC. THE SUBJECT AT OBJECT APPLICATIONS FOR RECOVERY OF COSTS BY INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO A REASONABLE THIS REVIEW. S. B. TEN MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE THE PLANNING AND RATE PROCESS FOR SAFETY RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCE TRANSPARENT AND PUBLIC. MEMBERS IN A WORLD A DRAMATIC CLIMATE CHANGE WERE WILDFIRE RATS THREATENS ALL YOUR LONG. AND WHERE DEVELOPMENT IS PUSHING FURTHER IN THE HINTERLANDS. WE MUST REQUIRE UTILITIES TO MEET THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PRO ACTIVELY INVEST IN THEIR SYSTEMS TO MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITY. OF IGNITED A YET ANOTHER DEVASTATING FIRE. MY CONSTITUENTS WERE DEVASTATED BY LACKS LAST OCTOBER'S FIRES DEMAND THAT UTILITIES DO ALL THEY CAN TO HARDEN THE GRID AND REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR SPARKING NEW WILDFIRES. BY REQUIRING THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISASTER RESILIENCY IN PREVENTION STANDARDS REQUIRE PLANTS TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS INVESTING TO ACHIEVE THOSE STANDARDS AND HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE STANDARDS. S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD TO PROTECT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND CONSTITUENTS. MEMBERS I'M AWARE OF THE ASSEMBLY HAS A BIPARTISAN WORK GROUP THAT IS WORKING ON THE SAME ISSUES THAT S. B.. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT ADDRESSES SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE SIT ON THAT WORK GROUP I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO COLLABORATING WITH THE WORK GROUP TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HARMONIZE. ALL THE SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS AT HAND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WITH ME HERE TODAY ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UNTIL THE EMPLOYEES AND OTHER WITNESSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK JOSEPH ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA TO THE EMPLOYEES. I'VE BEEN PRACTICING BEFORE THE PC FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND EVERYONE OF THOSE YEARS BEEN INVOLVED AND GENERATE CASES BEFORE THE COMMISSION. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THOSE RATE CASES SAFETY RELIABILITY GETS VERY LITTLE ATTENTION. IT'S A BY PRODUCT OF HAGGLING OVER MONEY IT IS NOT THE FOCUS. THAT PROCESS HAVE TO CHECK HAS TO CHANGE IF WE WANT -- A SAFER CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THAT CHANGE. THE BILL HAS A TWO STEP PROCESS. FIRST EVERY OTHER YEAR UTILITIES WOULD FILE SAFETY RELIABILITY PLANTS. WHICH WOULD CONTAIN ALL OF THEIR PROPOSALS -- FOR MAINTAINING SAFETY RELIABILITY AND ALL OF THE COSTS FOR DOING THAT. YOU'LL BE A PUBLIC PROCESS OF NOT BE IT APPEARS SEE INSIDER GAME WOULD BE A PUBLIC PROCESS. WITH FULL COMPLETE HEARINGS EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS BRIEFINGS ARGUMENTS THE WHOLE WORKS. IF YOU SEE WOULD EVALUATE THE PLANS WOULD REVISE THE PLANS IF NEEDED. AND I WOULD CONSIDER THE COSTS -- THAT IT WANTS TO ALLOCATE TO THOSE PLANS AND APPROVE THOSE COST IT IS NOT A BLANK CHECK. THE PC HAS TO APPROVE EVERY NICKEL. AND IT WOULD APPROVE THEM ONLY OF THOSE COSTS ARE REASONABLE. IN PARTICULAR SENATOR DODD NOTED IT WOULD PROHIBIT THE UTILITIES FROM DIVERTING ANY OF THAT MONEY TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE SAFETY RELIABILITY PLAN. THE SECOND STEP IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO IT'S THE ACCOUNTABILITY STEP [inaudible] EVERY YEAR. THE COMMISSION WILL REVIEW WITH THE UTILITY COMPLIED WITH ITS PLAN. IF YES IT WAS THAT WOULD FIND WAS PRUDENT IF NO THE UTILITY WILL GET FINED. NOW THERE ARE SOME WHO CLAIM THE BILL THE BILL WOULD SOMEHOW PROTECT THE UTILITY FROM DISALLOWANCE IS FOR IMPROVEMENTS. ON THE CONTRARY THAT BUILT SUBJECTS THE UTILITIES TO FIND EVERY EAR IF IT FAILS TO FOLLOW ITS APPROVED PLANT. IT'S MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABILITY THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- MY COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ON THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS [inaudible] ABOUT -- THE IMPACTS ON RATE PAYERS. FIRST -- AND YOU CAN LOOK ON PAGE FOURTEEN LINES FOUR THROUGH. SIX THE COMMISSION IS REQUIRED. TO EXAMINE THE FACTUAL. AND THAT TO DO A FACTUAL ANALYSIS OF ANY MAJOR EVENTS. THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PAST YEAR. SO IS NOT A BLANK CHECK BILL BE CLOSE RUBIO. AND SECOND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE COMMISSION. WE'LL HAVE TO DETERMINE IF ANY COST IMPOSE AND RATE PAYERS ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. IN THE SENATE AMENDMENTS WERE ADDED THAT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY -- THE COMMISSION'S OBLIGATION TO MAKE FINDINGS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH RATE PAIR PROTECTION DUTIES ESTABLISHED PURSUANT. TO SECTION FOUR FIFTY ONE OF THE CODE THAT'S ON PAGE FIND OF PAGE FIFTEEN LINES FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN SO UNDER THIS BILL RATE PAYERS ARE FULLY PROTECTED IN EFFECT MORE PROTECTED THAN CURRENTLY BECAUSE IT WILL BE SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS. TO REVIEW THE UTILITIES PERFORMANCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS OF A FEW WITNESSES HERE. FOR HANDED OVER THEM I JUST LIKE TO SAY. THAT JUST THIS WEEK STANDARD AND POOR'S [inaudible] DOWNGRADE UTILITIES. ALMOST JUNK BOND STATUS.

THE ONLY POSITIVE PIECE OF LEGISLATION HAS BEEN MOVING FORWARD TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND GIVE ANY. AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE TO MARKETS THAT THE FOLKS ARE PAYING ATTENTION IS SENATOR DODD'S BILL. WE NEED THIS BILL TO PASS AS IT IS. I ALSO QUALITY ATTENTION TO THE MEMBERS OF THAT LANGUAGE THAT MISTER JOSEPH READ WHERE. ABSOLUTELY UNDERLYING UNDERSCORED HIGHLIGHTED IN BOLD THE COMMISSION CANNOT APPROVE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THEIR RATE PAYER PROTECTION DUTIES IT DOESN'T GET STRONGER THAN THAT.

WE HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND TO PAYING MEMBERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. TURN OF THE PROPOSED TO F. B.. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT BECAUSE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLYING WITH THE PLAN [inaudible] REPRESENTS LOWERING FAVE DEFENDERS IT IF NOT THE FAME AS BEING PRUDENT. WERE POSTED THE BILL BECAUSE THE CREATE THE NEW EXPRESS LANE TO SHIFT THE COST OF MAJOR DISASTERS TO RATEPAYERS INSTEAD OF UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS. CURRENTLY THE CPU THINK CONDUCTS BACK THE CIVIC REVIEW OF UTILITY DISASTER AND IDENTIFIED ON THE EIGHTH BY CASE BASIS. ALL INSTANCES IN WHICH THE UTILITY ACTED PRUDENTLY AND IS THEREFORE ENTITLED TO REPAIR RECOVERY AND ALL INSTANCES IN WHICH THE UTILITY ACTED IMPRUDENTLY AND SHOULD PAY FOR DAMAGE INSTEAD OF PASSING IT RATEPAYERS. SB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT CHANGES THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY BY ELIMINATING THAT FACT DRIVEN IMPRUDENCE DETERMINATION AND INSTEAD ONLY F.. IF SO IF A FIFTY PLAN WITH A POTENTIALLY COMPLIED WITH. EVEN UP THERE ARE FACTS THAT INDICATE IMPRUDENCE. THE BILL EFFECTIVELY FOURTH SENIOR WORKING FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET PAPER WILDFIRE DAMAGE AT A TIME WHEN UTILITY SERVICE IS DISCONNECTED FOR NEARLY ONE MILLION. CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS EVERY YEAR WHO FALL BEHIND ON THEIR BILLS. S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT FAILED TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL POLICY FOR ILLUSION THAT ADDRESS THE VERY REAL CHALLENGES POSED BY WILDFIRE LIABILITY INVERSE CONDEMNATION STRICT LIABILITY A POTENTIALLY CRIPPLING COSTS. TO UTILITIES AND RATEPAYERS ALIKE I ASK FOR YOU KNOW VOTE AND COMMITMENT TO FIX SOLUTIONS. THAT BRING TOGETHER RATEPAYERS UTILITIES AND LABOR INSTEAD OF PROPOSALS THAT TARIFF APART. RURAL ON BEHALF OF THE AGONY ESOS WE REPRESENT A MAJOR FARMING AND FOOD PROCESSING OPERATIONS [inaudible] FOR NOW. WE SHARE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY MARK TONY. AS IT RELATES TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL THE ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RATES ARE RATES IN CALIFORNIA READY HIGHER MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY ARE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE NATION. ARE FARMERS PAY MORE THAN DOUBLE WHAT THEY PAY AND MOST OF THE OTHER AG PRODUCING STATES. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE USE A LOT MORE ENERGY MOVE WATER FOR FARMING IS GALLAGHER AND OTHERS. UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FROM A RATE PAYER IMPLICATIONS STANDPOINT. AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED I BEEN PARTICIPATING IN GENERAL RATE CASES ON BEHALF OF THE I. COMMUNITY FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE DON'T BELIEVE THE PROCESS SET UP BY THIS BILL DOES IS A BALANCE PROCESS. BY THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THE UTILITIES COME AND WITH A VERY HIGH NUMBER AND HE'S RIGHT PROCEEDINGS AND LOOKING TO COMPROMISE AND REDUCE IT DOWN AND WE JUST GIVING EXAMPLE. SOCAL GAS TODAY HAS A 40% GAS RATE INCREASE PENDING AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE READ AND DIG INTO THAT RATE CASE WHAT YOU FIND OUT IT'S ALL RELATED TO SAFETY FOR ALL THE SO CANYON. WE'RE GONNA SEE THE EXACT SAME SORT OF MASSIVE RATING CREASES PROPOSED AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE HUGE COST IMPLICATIONS ON BUSINESSES AND RICK RESIDENTIAL RATEPAYERS IN THE STATE AND WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I WANT TO POINT TO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY GOOD ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE BY THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT ITEM SIX IN THAT ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES ONE OF THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. WHICH IS THE END RUN POTENTIALLY ON LIABILITY ISSUES WE DISAGREE THAT THIS WON'T HAVE SOME IMPLICATIONS AS IT RELATES TO WHO PAYS. WE BELIEVE IT DOES HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS THAT NEED FURTHER EXAMINATION AND THEN FINALLY LET ME JUST MAKE THE POINT. THE UTILITIESHAVE A VERY PERVERSE INCENTIVE TODAY THE MORE THEY INVEST THE MORE MONEY THEY MAKE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GUARANTEED RATE OF RETURN AND SO IF THEY CAN SHIFT ALL THESE COSTS ON TO CONSUMERS. TO REDUCE THEIR LIABILITY THERE'S NO CHECK ON THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND SHUT HIS MUCH UNDER RATEPAYERS. AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN BECAUSE IT REDUCES THEIR LIABILITY AND ON TOP OF THAT TO GET THERE AND A BIG FAT RATE OF RETURN ON TOP OF EVERY DIME THEY INVEST SO THERE'S NO INCENTIVE. AT ALL FOR THEM TO KEEP THESE COSTA. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BRISBANE JANA BATH OF KLAY CAN CALIFORNIA LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS -- REPRESENTING STEEL CEMENT A BEVERAGE MANUFACTURES PIPELINE IN WAR. OUT AGAIN THE ANALYSIS IS IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY WELL DONE IN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS THE COMPLEXITY. AND I THINK THE THE GOALS OF THAT MISTER DODD IS IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE IT I THINK ARE CERTAINLY LAUDABLE. AND AND WE AGREE SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE WE DO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE THE STATEMENT THAT NOTHING'S BEING DONE OR SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT'S NEW -- THE S. MAP. AND I AND THE RAMP WHICH TAKE PLACE IN GENERAL RATE CASES SO THAT'S THE RISK ASSESSMENT MITIGATION PHASE IN THE PAST SAFETY MODELING ASSESSMENT PROCEEDING IT TAKES PLACE IN THE GENERATORS. HOW HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF EVIDENCE AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION BY INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS THIS COMPRESSED UNREALISTIC EIGHTEEN MONTH TIME FRAME? WILL NOT ALLOW FOR THAT SAME LEVEL OF SCRUTINY. AND WHAT THE UTILITIES BRING THEIR RESOURCES COMPARED TO WHAT WE CANNOT THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO THE TABLE WE GET WHEN WE GET RUN OVER WE DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES. TO FIGHT AT THE SAME LEVEL WITH THE UTILITIES CAN BRING TO THIS THIS IS WHAT THEY DO FOR A LIVING. RIGHT OR JUST TRYING TO KEEP OUR RATES DOWN SO WE CAN KEEP JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU APARTMENT OTHER UNCERTAIN IF YOU KNOW WHAT BUT THE MISTER CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I AGREE WITH YOU KNOW ALL THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE PREVIOUSLY -- IN IN OPPOSITION S. B. TENNEY WORDS OR ASK EVERYONE TO KNOW. INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICITY RATES ARE WERE WILL ALSO WELL ABOVE TWICE IN SOME CASES ABOVE THE AVERAGE OR ABOVE THE RATES. IN OUR NEIGHBORING STATES SO AS FAR AS COMPETITIVENESS GOES. THE IMPACTS TO INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICAL LITERACY RATES AS WELL AS RESIDENTS RATES BUT IT REALLY DOES RAISE SOME PARTICULAR. YOU KNOW HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO CREATE JOBS MAKE NEW INVESTMENTS A CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S SHOWING IN THOUGH THE LAGGING INVESTMENT CREATION CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING SECTOR -- RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. NOT THE LAST POINT OUT I WANTED TO NOTE IS IN ADDITION TO THAT. IS THAT IS THE PROCESS ISSUE I THINK MR BOCA DORA MENTION THIS BRIEFLY. BUT THE GENERAL RATE CASE PROCEEDING LOOKS AT THAT ALL OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT GENERATION. A TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICITY LOOKS AT THE SAFETY OR RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF THE TO THE RESILIENCE HE'S LOOKING AT DIFFERENT. ASPECTS OF AND LOOKING AT ALL THOSE COSTS TOGETHER. THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH SEGMENTING OUT ALL OF THAT -- THAT THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY SHE RELATED TO WILDFIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS AND AND SAFETY OPERATIONS AS WELL. NOW IS THE FACT THAT IT TAKES ALL OF THE FOCUS AND PUTS IT ON THAT AND WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR A POLITICAL APPOINTEE ON THE COMMISSION TO MAKE A DECISION TO NOT SUPPORT. WHATEVER'S BEFORE THEN BECAUSE IT IS DEEMED TO BE THIS IS WHAT IS THIS IS WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR SAFETY. SUBDIVIDED FICKLE DECISION TO MAKE I THINK IT IN IN A PER INDIVIDUAL IN THAT POSITION. I IN ADDITION TO THAT IT BECAUSE IT TAKES ALL OF FOLK THE CONTEXT OFF OF THE REST THAT -- ALL THE OTHER ISSUES RAISED REALLY TO THAT BECOMES VERY EASY TO SAY WELL THAT SOUNDS THAT SOUNDS APPROPRIATE THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE WILL THOSE COSTS ARE GOING TO GET FED INTO THE GENERAL RATE CASE. AND WHAT HISTORICALLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT INDUSTRIAL RATEPAYERS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE -- DID TAKING YOU KNOW INCREASINGLY. NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES AS RESULT OF THE WAY THE P. YOU SEE IS HANDLED AS WELL SO WE DO HAVE CONCERNS YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PROCESS. THE IMPACTS OF THIS IT CERTAINLY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN DESERVES -- DO ATTENTION AND YOU KNOW THAT IS IS BEING BROUGHT IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS I THINK BRINGING EVERYBODY TOGETHER. YOU KNOW PERHAPS ARE THE CHAIRMAN'S LEADERSHIP. FORWARD WE UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT SEE S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT AS THE RIGHT MOVE AT THIS POINT TIME. WELCOME OF THOSE WHO ARE HERE TO AT THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL NAME AND AFFILIATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALICE KESSLER HERE ON BEHALF OF FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

MISTER CHAIRMAN -- AT PRINT SHOP WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK ASKED ME TO ALSO ADD ME. TO TO THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR THAT -- AS IF YOU AS EVERYONE WHO HAD A POSITION ON THIS BILL SPOKEN ON IT. OKAY THANK YOU WITH WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE LET ME IF I COULD DOCTOR QUIRK BEFORE I TURN -- TO TO THE MEMBERS AREA BECAUSE I I WOULD HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RESPECT FOR SENATOR DODD AND NINE AND WE CERTAINLY -- AGREEMENT MORE TIMES THAN AFFECT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME WE DISAGREED BUT I WANTED -- TO TANK YOU FOR AT LEAST -- HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT THE BILL FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT. OF SOME OF OF THE CONCERNS AS I POINTED OUT TO YOU -- I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT CERTAINLY -- IN AND YOUR INTENT LANGUAGE RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF THE FIRES FROM LAST YEAR AND CERTAINLY IN YEARS PAST AND WHAT THAT. MEANS AND HOW SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT STATION -- WE TRIED TO LOOK AT THE BILL AND FIND A WAY TO CARVE OUT A SAFETY BILL -- THERE ARE ELEMENTS TO THIS THAT REQUIRED QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF DETAILED -- REVIEW OF THE WE DIDN'T GO AS DEEPLY IN SOME AREAS THAT WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT. AND TO PRESERVE THE SAFETY ELEMENTS OF THE BILL CLEARLY -- THE P. YOU SEE THERE MAY BE ELEMENTS OF YOUR BILL THAT -- COMPLEMENT THEIR PROCESS BUT IT COULD BE ELEMENTS OF THE BILL THAT ARE CONTRARY TO THE PROCESS -- WE ARE NOT CLEAR JUST YET ON WHAT THOSE REPRESENT AND HOW THEY WOULD BE RECEIVED AND HOW THEY WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE CPU. UC'S. OUR PROCESS AND REVIEW. THE OTHER PART IF I COULD -- JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT WE'RE WE'RE ALSO A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GENERAL RATE CASE -- PROCESS AND HOW THIS IS OUTSIDE OR DEVIATES FROM THAT EXISTING PROCESS AND THAT DOES CAUSE SOME CONCERNS -- BUT HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT THOSE ELEMENTS WE WERE PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD ON BUT THE PART THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. IS THE ELEMENT THAT DEALS WITH AN ITEM. SIX THE RATE PAYER VULNERABILITY AND WHAT THAT COULD ULTIMATELY MEAN AND HOW IT COULD BE ULTIMATELY INTERPRETED AND AS YOU KNOW -- AT LEAST IN THIS HOUSE THIS YEAR WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO LOOK AT FIRE LIABILITY. AND HOW TO PROPOSE SOME TYPE OF A SOLUTION A CERTAINLY IN THE WORKING GROUP THAT WE HAVE BEEN AFFILIATED WITH. THERE HAS BEEN NO CONSENSUS ARE THERE ARE STILL. CONCERNS ABOUT HOW YOUR BILL COULD BE -- THAT ISSUE COULD STILL BE IMPACTED AND FIND ITS WAY INTO THIS PROCESS AND WE THANK. AT LEAST THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO STRIKE THE ITEM. SIX HOW WHICH WOULD THEN GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO REVIEW. OF THE LARGER ISSUES AROUND -- SPREADING COSTS AMONGST RATEPAYERS AND HOW THAT MIGHT BE ADDRESSED AND A AND A COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND AND FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAY -- AND I THINK THAT THAT IS THE THE HEART SOUL OF WHY WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE DID. AND SO I'M -- I KNOW THAT IT'S A RECOMMENDATION. CORD BUT I HAS YOU SHARED IT WITH ME I'LL GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY THIS A WHERE THEY'RE NOT YOU. YOU -- CONTINUE TO HOLD ON TO THAT POSITION BUT IT'S MY HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW. AND UPON REFLECTION AND ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY THAT -- YOU WOULD -- EXCEPT THE THE RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEAD ITEM SIX TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL AS AS STATED IN PRATT -- THERE'S STILL A LOT OF IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN HERE FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE DE ENERGIZING CONCEPTS IN A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND STRATEGIES THAT I THINK. DESERVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND AGAIN. MAKING IT ABOUT SAFETY AND THAT WAS OUR INTENT TO SORT OF PUT THE FOCUS IN THAT AREA. AND SO I I LAY THAT BEFORE YOU AND ALSO THE COMMITTEE -- THAT THE COMMITTEE IS PREPARED MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL AND MOVE YOUR BILL ALONG WITH THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD STRIKE OF THE ITEM SIX ON AS ADDRESSES REPAIR VULNERABILITY. WELL MISTER CHAIR. A FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION -- I SHARE YOUR YOUR FEELINGS AT THE TOP YOUR CONVERSATION I HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR YOU I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND -- GOES BEYOND SAFETY I THINK THE EASY THING TO DO FOR NOT RIGHT NOW FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE EASY THING TO DO FOR THIS COMMITTEE. IS THE POT TO SAFETY -- THIS IS A HARD BILL. IT'S GIVING YOU ALL A HARD DECISION BUT IT THAT I MY PHONE'S BEEN RINGING OFF THE HOOK AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE. IN MY OFFICE FOR WEEKS I'VE. GOD THROUGH THE SAME THING IN THE SENATE WHEN THE SIMILAR TYPE OF CONCERNS. AND NOBODY I HAVE. AS MANY EGGMAN AMBER'S. OF MY COMMUNITY WINERIES THROUGHOUT NAPA AND SONOMA COUNTY AND FARMS AND SOLANO COUNTY I'VE AS MANY EGG. INSTEAD TO ITS AS ANYBODY IN THE ROOM I HAVE AS MANY MANUFACTURING. COMMUNITIES PROPER COMPANIES AS ANYBODY IN THE ROOM OR CLOSE AND CERTAINLY. THE SAME AMOUNT OF A CONSTITUENTS IT SENATORS AND MAYBE TWICE AS MANY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR SITUATION WHERE WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE RATES AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO HOME. TO MY DISTRICT AND WE HAVE JUST DONE NOTHING BUT INCREASED RATES ON MANY FACTORS INCREASE RATES ON ON HOMER'S NOTHING. COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH BUT BECAUSE THERE IS A FEAR OF THAT. ALL THE SUDDEN THERE'S A DIALOGUE AROUND. NOT DOING ANYTHING NOT MOVING FORWARD. AND AS I SAID BEFORE -- THE ASSEMBLY I MEMBERS THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING ON THIS I'VE PLEDGED TO WORK. I'M NOT SEPARATE WITH THEM IN CONCERT WITH THEM MOVING TOGETHER TO GET THE RIGHT SOLUTION I ALSO -- BELIEVE THAT -- THIS GOES TO THE G. O. COMMITTEE AND THEN IT GOES TO APPROACH AFTER SESSION I BELIEVE WE HAVE TIME -- FOR ME TO WORK WITH THE CHAIRMAN FOR ME TO WORK WITH -- THE ADMINISTRATION AND OF IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY WORKING GROUP AND HOPEFULLY -- IN THE SENATE WILL HAVE ONE THAT'LL AT WORK I WITH YOU AND HOPEFULLY I'LL BE ON THAT -- BEFORE WHAT RIGHT. WE COULD HAVE SOME YOU KNOW ANSWERS TO THESE. REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT -- I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IT TO HAVE A VOTE ON THE BILL AS IT'S PROPOSED. AND WORK WITH THE MEMBERS HERE AND WORK WITH THE THE ADMINISTRATION AND AND AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SOME. TOUGH CHOICES SO THAT WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT IT'S GONNA BE IN MAYBE. MAYBE IT'S AN OFF RAMP LIKE THE GOVERNOR HAD ON THEM HAD STILL ON THE MINIMUM WAGE -- MAYBE THERE'S AN OFF RAMP IF WHEN HE GETS THE CPUC UP I'VE GOT SOME IDEAS ON THAT BOBBY WORKING HAVE TALKED ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. YOU KNOW OF A ABOUT THAT SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT AND LIKE. TO HAVE AN UP OR DOWN ON THIS VOTE ON THIS BILL. APPRECIATE THAT A SENATOR AND HOW. SO WITH THAT MY OF MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE. TO ARE ALLOWED TO CARVE THAT PIECE OUT AND ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND HAPPEN THROUGH OF LEADERSHIP IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PROVIDING THAT LEADERSHIP AND I DO BELIEVE THAT. WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE END OF SESSION BUT IF IT'S LEFT AND THAT I WOULD NOT. BE PREPARED TO SUPPORT. THE BILL OF TO FORCE TODAY UP MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH WHERE I'M AT ON THIS RIGHT NOW IS. GIVEN THE TIME I BELIEVE THAT IF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEADERSHIP IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF GOING. THIS IS GOING TO BE MET A QUICK DEATH IN APPROPRIATIONS. ALMOST CERTAINLY IF IT DOESN'T THERE AND THE GOVERNOR'S GOT ITS OWN WAY OF DOING IT HE'LL BE ABLE -- TO YOU KNOW REJECT THE BILL. ALL THE RESPECT LIKE THIS SEE A PROPOSED LAB. VOTED ON UPPER DOUBTED A I'M GONNA TURN TO OTHER MEMBERS WERE. STUCK HERE QUIRK -- BUT FIRST OF ALL I'M GOING. TO TALK TO THE BILL WITHOUT THE CHAIRS AMENDMENT. I SUPPORT THE BILL WITHOUT THE CHAIRS AMENDMENT -- DISOBEY THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR I HAVEN'T SPORTED THE CHAIR AND I HOPE IT'S THE LAST. BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK THAT -- THE PART OF THE BILL THE CHAIR ONCE TAKEN THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT LET ME ADDRESS A FEW OTHER THINGS FIRST. ARM WITH THE CHAIRS OUR PERMISSION. UP WE HEARD FROM TWELVE FORTY FIVE THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL AS WRITTEN MEANING WITHOUT YOUR AMENDMENT. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAME UP IN SUPPORT. WE DON'T KNOW. WHETHER THEY WERE SUPPORTING IT WITH YOUR AMENDMENT OR WITHOUT -- IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN FIND OUT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN SUPPORT PERHAPS BY A RAISE OF HANDS WEB THAT WHICH WAY THEY WERE SUPPORTING THE BILL WITH THEIR WITHOUT YOUR AMENDMENT BECAUSE THE OKAY SO WELL ASSUME UNLESS PEOPLE SHOUT OUT DIFFERENTLY THAT THIS WAS SUPPORT OF THE BILL WITHOUT THE CHAIRS AMENDMENT. ALL RIGHT -- FIRST OF ALL A INDUSTRIAL RATEPAYERS DO PAY TOO MUCH AND LARGE ENERGY USE USED TO PAY TOO MUCH. I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE THING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT BUT I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT VEHICLE FOR IT. I WOULD BE GLAD AND WORKING WITH OTHERS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE BUT I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT WAY TO ADDRESS IT BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. OKAY SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING AND I'VE BEEN ON BOTH -- AUTUMN BARRACKS -- BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE I'VE BEEN ON THE CHAIRS -- COMMITTEE AND WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WHAT WE KEEP ON HEARING. IS YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING. THINGS AREN'T -- SAFE ENOUGH. RPG AND THE THERE CULPABLE THEY DIDN'T DO ENOUGH THIS IS WHAT I'M HEARING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE PEOPLE THINK THE MONEY IS COMING FROM BUT IN THE END IT COMES FROM RATE PAYERS WATER P. G.'S IN AS IT ASSETS RIGHT NOW WELL. LET'S SEE NOW IT CAN'T GET INSURANCE ANYMORE WITHOUT PAYING SOMETHING LIKE 33% A YEAR FOR WHAT THEY UPDATE YET -- WELL THEY HAVE A RETAIL BUSINESS BUT THAT'S ALL GOING TO THE CCA'S THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS. BUY THE LINES YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO WELCOME -- V. -- INVERSE CONDEMNATION YOU BASICALLY BECOME THE FIRE ENSURE FOR THE STATE SURE THEY HAVE ASSETS NONE OF WHICH YOU WERE UNFORTUNATELY WORTH VERY MUCH AT THIS POINT. AND THE BOND RATING IS IN THE TOILET SO THEY CAN'T TAKE BONDS. THIS MONEY IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME FROM RATEPAYERS THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET IT AND THAT DOES MEAN RATES WILL GO UP -- ALREADY WE'VE HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR THAT HE'S WILLING TO LOOK AT OFF RAMPS -- THE SECOND THING I WANT. TO POINT OUT IS THAT. OUR PEOPLE SAY WE SHOULD KEEP WITH THE OLD PROCESS. WELL THERE'S A PROVEN CROSS SECTION. COST SAVING IT'S IN THE FINDING CHAIR IN THE BILL. I'M THAT YOU GET A LARGE COST SAVING. BY IMPROVING THE SYSTEM AND NOT ALLOWING FIRES. P. YOU SEE HASN'T DONE THAT -- AS SOMEONE ELSE SAID V. -- ENERGY COMPANIES ASK FOR A LOT OF MONEY. OB THEY WANNA FOR EXAMPLE APPROVE IMPROVE THE SITUATION AROUND THE NATURAL GAS. OF FACILITIES AND IMPROVE THE SAFETY SO WE DON'T GET THE SMELLY GAS AROUND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PAY FOR THAT AND UTILITIES DON'T REALLY HAVE LARGE ASSETS THAT THEY COULD PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES IT HAS TO COME FROM RATEPAYERS. SO YEAH WE'RE GONNA TO COME FROM RATEPAYERS. THE FINAL THING I WANT TO ADDRESS IS THE AMENDMENT THAT THE CHAIR TALKED ABOUT. NO MAYBE THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO WRITE THIS BUT RIGHT NOW UTILITIES HAVE NO GUIDELINES. WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. YOU SEE? ABOUT THE PROCEEDINGS WHILE AND I ASKED HIM I SAID DOES THIS MEAN IN THE PROCEEDINGS ARE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. HE SAID YES [inaudible] ALRIGHT. GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT BELIEVE ME YOU WILL NEVER BE FOUND INNOCENT. ARE IN THE CASE OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS OF CHEESE ME SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ELECTRIC. THERE WAS AN OPERATOR ON THE LINES WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WHO DECIDED NOT TO DE ENERGIZE A LINE. COMMISSIONERS VOTED FIVE ZERO THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DE ENERGIZE THE LINE TO SEE IF THEY KNEW WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AND AGAIN I'VE HEARD FOR THE COMMISSION IS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW. WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD HAVE DE ENERGIZED THE LINE BUT THAT'S WHAT THE PRECEDING SAID THERE ARE NO STANDARDS. NOW I THINK YOU KNOW WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE EXACT RIGHT STANDARD -- WE CAN WE CAN FIDDLE WITH SOME OF THE WORDING BUT THERE HAS TO BE A STANDARD. I CAN'T JUST SAY O. P. GENIE I KNOW YOU TRIM THE MILLION AND A HALF TREES BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE TRIMMED A MILLION AND A HALF AND THREE AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU TEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH BY THE WAY. P. GENIE DOESN'T HAVE. THEMOST LIKELY -- SCENARIO IS IF WE GO AHEAD WITH THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND WE FIND THE AND THIS BILL HAS BY THE WAY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LAST FIRE THIS IS GOING AHEAD. THE MOST LIKELY THING IS P. JEANNIE GOES BANKRUPTCY WHICH IS GOOD FOR PGM EIGHT LOOK AT HOW WELL THEY DID THE LAST TIME. BUT ALSO LOOK LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WORKERS IN THE RATE PAYERS. LAST TIME WHEN THEY WENT WE ARE STILL PAYING A LARGE BILL BECAUSE P. JEANNIE WENT BANKRUPT. WE ARE STILL PAYING A LARGE BILL BECAUSE THE STATE TOOK OVER FROM THE ENERGY COMPANIES WHEN THEY COULDN'T BUY POWER ANYMORE. AND THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. SO HERE WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP A STANDARD -- AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT STANDARD -- SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT POLICY WE NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO BEFORE IT HAPPENS. IF THERE IS NO STANDARD. FAT AND THIRD YEARS YES BEING WHAT IT IS. THEY SHOULD DO AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW SO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW THAT SOME PEOPLE WANT TO CONTINUE HAPPENING WE HAVE A PROCEEDING WHERE THE MONEY DOESN'T GET ASIDE. FOR WHERE THE MONEY IS TO PUT ASIDE FOR SAFETY WE HAVE A WAY THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD SYSTEM. ALRIGHT I AM NOW GOING TO MOVE THE BELL AS WRITTEN WITHOUT THE CHAIR WITH DUE RESPECT FOR THE CHAIR OF THE HELP I CAN READ SUPPORT OF EVERY OTHER TIME THIS YEAR. BUT WITH THAT WITH DUE RESPECT FOR THE CHAIR I SEE I MOVE THE BILL WITHOUT THE CHAIRS AMENDMENT. I'LL TAKE TWO DIVERSIONS FROM MA -- MY MY FRIEND MISTER QUIRK I HAVE NOT ALWAYS AGREED WITH THE CHAIR AND I WILL BE BRIEF [inaudible] OF A BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S ALREADY BEEN WORKED OUT THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE THE VOTES -- BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY. I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME I THINK WE NEED A GRANDER PLAN. RIGHT AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS A PIECE OF THAT GRANDER PLAN BUT IT IS NOT ENCOMPASSING ASSEMBLY WHO REPRESENTS AN AREA THAT'S GONNA BE HUNDRED EIGHT THIS WEEKEND. WE ALREADY HAVE EXTRAORDINARILY COSTS OF ABOUT OF ENERGY ASSEMBLY WHO REPRESENTS AN AREA WHERE WE STILL PROCESS FOOD AND WE HAVE A LOT OF BAG AND WE KNOW. THAT OUR WE HAVE OUR OUR AGRICULTURE ECONOMY HAS BEEN. OUT OF HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE AND AND BEFORE AND THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE -- DE THEN THE DOWNWARD. PORTION ON IT -- AS FAR AS ENERGY RATES AND I HAVE USED A AND I AND I WILL USE THE SAME ANALOGY KEEP USING OF CRAP BUT AS A SOCIAL WORKER. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS. THE SUMMARY IS GONNA COMMIT SUICIDE. I DO A SAFETY PLAN. I DISCIPLINE TO KEEP THEIR PERSONAL LIFE THAT I THINK I PRAYER WENT UP GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD. THEY DO EVERYTHING I ASK. AND YET THE END THEY STILL END UP [inaudible] FOLLOWING THROUGH. WHEN WE PUT IN SAFETY PLANS THEY ARE ONLY I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT IN THE MOMENT? BUT AS FAR AS THE GRAND IMPACT OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. THERE'S NO PLANNING WE CAN DO ECONOMICALLY ADDRESS ALL OF THAT WITHOUT. OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE. THE PLANS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. WE ALREADY HAVE MULTIPLE PLANT A SEED CBB IT P. UC IS WORKING ON RIGHT NOW I THINK THIS PUTS A REALLY EXPEDITED WAY AND CERTAINLY ANYTHING WE KNOW. IS THAT WE DON'T MOVE VERY QUICKLY AROUND HERE. THAT NOW WE'RE ASKING EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN WITHIN APPEARED EIGHTEEN MONTHS I ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I AGAIN I KEEP HEARING ABOUT A GRANDER PLAN IS COMING TOGETHER I HOPE THAT HAPPENS AND I HOPE THAT I WILL BE ABLE SUPPORT WHEN WE GET THERE. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE OUR UTILITY WORKERS WORKING WE NEED TO HAVE -- DE RELIABLE POWER AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE SAFETY AND WE'RE COMING BACK INTO WILDFIRE SEASON AGAIN. SO BUT STILL CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO GET THIS JOB DONE. AND I AND I CERTAINLY HOPE WE GET THERE BEFORE THIS LEGISLATIVE SEASON IS OVER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF A FIRST OF ALL I WANNA ECHO APPRECIATION -- OF THE CHAIR AND WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND I I REALLY I REALLY. A HONESTLY -- WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF HARD WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING UP TOGETHER -- SECONDLY OF SOMETIMES I THINK WE WE THINK WE KNOW SO MUCH FOR SO. CERTAIN. WHEN WE REALLY DON'T? AND THAT'S WHY I'M. A INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS WRITTEN [inaudible] AND TAKE THE CHAIR PARA. UP AND TO CHECK TAKE MR DOT UP -- ON THEIR COMMITMENTS AND PROMISES TO WORK THROUGH THIS WITH AN EYE TOWARD WHAT THIS DOES. TO RATE PAYERS AND THIRDLY. WE ARE ACTUALLY HAVING THE BEGINNINGS OF THAT BIGGER. SURE CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. AND I AM CONCERNED THAT THE CLOCK IS TICKING. AND IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST DOING SOMETHING. BUT IT IS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING THAT WORKS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS FAIR AND REASONABLE. AND OING SOMETHING THAT'S RESPONSIBLE. AND I THINK THAT THE THAT MOTHER NATURE AND THE WILDFIRES IN THE PLACE WE ARE IN TODAY HAS DEALT US A HORRIBLE SET OF PLAYING CARDS [inaudible] AFFECTING EVERYBODY AND THE SUREST WAY FOR US. TO GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THIS THERE'S THIS HORRIBLE -- SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS TO TRY EVERYTHING WE KNOW HOW TO DRIVE THESE RISKS DOWN. BY MANAGING THE FORCE BETTER BY SAFETY PLANTS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD BY HOLDING THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE SAFETY PLANTS. AND SO FOR A LOT OF REASONS -- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD. AND I ALSO -- DO WANT TO REITERATE THOUGH AND AS I'VE MENTIONED TO US. THE MANUFACTURERS AND TO AGRICULTURE -- RATES AND WHAT RATES ARE DOING AT THE AGRICULTURE AND AND MANUFACTURING IS IS -- IT'S TERRIBLE. AND YET IT IT IT HAS THE IT I DON'T THINK IT IS RESIDENT IN THIS BILL. ON I THINK WHAT HAS CAUSED THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN POLICIES OF COME OUT OF THIS PLACE ANOTHER BILLS AND OTHER -- EFFORTS THAT HAVE JUST BASICALLY SAID YOU GOT THE DEEP POCKETS WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT THAT TO YOU. SO FOR A LOT OF REASONS I THINK THIS IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD. AND I HOPE THAT IT DEMONSTRATES A WILLINGNESS TO MOVE BEYOND JUST THE MEETINGS IN THE DISCUSSIONS. AND TOWARD GETTING THE ADMINISTRATION GETTING OUR COMMIT WORKING GROUP GETTING THAT MEMBER BURKE WORKING GROUP TOGETHER WORKING THROUGH TO GET TO THESE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS WE'D WE DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE OF DECIDING ON SOMETHING PERFECT. BUT WE DO HAVE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE A DECISION ON SOMETHING THAT WILL MOVE FORWARD OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. TO DEAL WITH THE OVER ARCHING PROBLEM OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THESE FIRES. AND I THINK THIS IS A A GOOD DECENT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT RATES AND I'M GOING TO CONTINUE. TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MEN AS THE PROCESS MOVES FORWARD AND AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN A BIGGER. ABOUT PICTURE AND GET TO THAT TO THE TO THE BIG LOOK. OF THAT I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO BE THERE ON BEHALF OF THOSE THAT I THINK ARE -- UNFORTUNATELY MISTREATED BY SOME OF THE OTHER POLICIES THAT HAVE COME TO THIS BUILDING. FIGURES CHAIR. A SENATOR. AFTER THE FIRES THAT OCCURRED -- LAST YEAR I MEMBERS A FEW WEEKS -- SEEING YOU DOWNTURN EVENT DOWN IN SOUTHERN CAL AND IT'S THE MEMBERS SEEM EMOTION -- IT IN YOUR EYES A FROM PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD KNOWN WHO LOST A THAT EVERYTHING I'M FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES -- THIS IS A BILL THAT'S DIFFICULT AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT AND JUST DO. A POLITICAL SHOWMANSHIP VALUE ACTUALLY DUG AND YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE OVERALL PROBLEM YOU'RE TO BE COMMENDED OF FOR THAT -- I AM WELL ON ON BOTH WORKING GROUPS AND I'VE SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME ON THIS OVERALL QUESTION OF WHAT WE DO. ABOUT STRICT LIABILITY IN THE RISKS -- TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE -- A SECURE ENERGY SYSTEM HERE IN THE IN THE STATE AND THE PROBLEMS ARE -- ARE GREAT OF THE SOLUTIONS SO WE DON'T HAVE ONE YET FACT THE ONLY ONE THAT WE DO HAVE TODAY. IS IN THIS BILL AND IF WE ELIMINATE -- THAT LANGUAGE AND ITEM NUMBER SIX THEM THERE'S REALLY NO POINT WE ARE SAYING WE DON'T HAVE -- ANY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM THIS ISN'T THE ONLY SOLUTION BUT IT IS A PIECE. OF THE PUZZLE AND SO I WANT TO CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU. I'M I THINK THIS IS FANTASTIC WORK IT'S NOT PERFECT OF COURSE AB LET'S CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING TOGETHER AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT -- TODAY. AWAKE AT HEARING KNOW OTHERS WHO LIKE TO TO SPEAK ON THE ISSUE GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. DON'T THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA A FOR FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU KNOW THE SECOND THOSE COMMENTS THAT -- YOU KNOW. IT THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE -- AND YOU KNOW AS A AS REPRESENTATIVE WHO CAME WHO COMES FROM THE DISTRICT THAT HAD FIRES RAVAGE THROUGH. MY COMMUNITIES -- YEAH WE CAN'T JUST IGNORE THIS WE GOT IT WE GOTTA TAKE THIS ON NEON SOMEBODY WHO ALSO REPRESENTS OROVILLE DAM IN AND SAW WHAT WE WENT THROUGH THERE. A WITH THAT NEAR DISASTER -- WAS THE IMPETUS FOR A SAY WE NEED TO DO BETTER FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND OUR PLANS -- AND SO I VERY MUCH HE HAS BEEN A LOT OF RABBIT TRAILS -- YOU KNOW IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT I THINK THE HEART OF YOUR BILL IS ABOUT. RAISING THE BAR -- FOR SAFETY THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S DEFICIENCIES OUT THERE. BOB AND IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT A DEFINITE STANDARD -- A SAFETY STANDARD TIME FOR BEFORE I USE. AND SO KNOW WE NEED TO DO THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A COST TO DO IT. THERE'S A COST TO DOING WHAT IT TAKES TO IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE MAKE IT SAFER. AND I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE BORNE BY RATE PAYERS ALONE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR INTENT. THAT AND AND AND I DON'T THINK THE BILL EVEN SAYS THAT SO -- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES TO STILL REMAIN TO BE WORKING NOT WORKED ON NO GOING FORWARD I GUESS MY TWO BIG CONCERNS WOULD BE I THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT A SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WAS THAT MEAN LET'S. LET'S DEFINE WHAT THAT MEANS OR MAYBE JUST SAY COMPLIANCE VIA COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN -- SHOWS THAT YOU'RE PRUDENT -- AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER PART WOULD BE IN AND AND PERHAPS SOMEONE CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION IS -- NEAR AYE I HEAR THE COMPLAINTS FROM FROM THE OPPOSITION -- THAT THIS MAYBE SETS UP A NEW -- PROCESS RIGHT THAT COULD BE MAYBE MAYBE THIS PROCESS COULD BE PUT INTO THE GENERAL RATE MAKING PROCESS OR OTHER SAFETY PROCESS HE'S THAT -- ARTIGO THROUGH THE PC. TO AVOID TO AVOID SORT OF DUPLICATION OR DIEM MAYBE MORE COSTLY -- PROCESS HE'S TO THE PC. ARE NOT UP THAT'S IS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT JUST CAME ROUTE -- FOR YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES -- YOU KNOW IF THIS BILL MOVES FOR TODAY. WHAT WE'RE OPEN TO THAT SEVEN MEMBER? THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I SPECTER THE CENTER'S WORK -- TO ADDRESS. THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT -- YOUR DISTRICT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT. WITH THAT MANY OF THESE ISSUES -- BUT I AS FOR AS THE BEING THERE PRESENTED WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I HEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT HOW WE CANNOT DO. WE WE WE CANNOT STAND BY AND DO NOTHING. BUT WE ARE DOING SOMETHING HERE BY [inaudible] VOTING. ON THIS BILL TODAY [inaudible] AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR. THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. TO BE UTILITIES AND TO ALL THE ELECTRICAL WORKERS. MY PROBLEM IS WITH THIS. ALMOST BLANK CHECK THAT WE'RE PASSING. TO PASS THE COSTS. ONTO RATE PAYERS. THE TERM LETTER ON PAGE. TWO INDICATES THAT UNDER THE PROPOSED. PC SECTION A UTILITY IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PLAN. WOULD BE INSULATED FROM A FINDING OF IMPRUDENCE EVEN IF UTILITY NEGLIGENCE COST A WAD FAR OF THE DISASTER. I THINK AS A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION I THINK IT'S A AS POINTED OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WHEN THE UTILITY? THEN AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I'M READING FROM THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THE WHEN THE UTILITIES. ISN'T SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. WHAT'S WITH FILED AND IMPROVE SAFETY RELIABILITY RESILIENCE PLAN. THAT THEY WOULD BE OF THE PASS ON THE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS AND SO. LIKE WITH ANY COMPLICATED PROCESS WE NEED TO HAVE DUE PROCESS WE NEED TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STAKEHOLDERS. TO BE OF THE WAY AND BEFORE THE COSTS ARE PASSED ON TO RATEPAYERS AND SO. I'M AFRAID THAT WE ARE MAKING. A BAD SITUATION EVEN WORSE. BY PASSING THIS BILL ALONG. AND FOR THAT REASON. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS SHOOTING. I THINK MISTER CHAIR I'M GONNA ECHO NAM MISTER COURSE COMMENTS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THOUGH LE UN I'VE DISCREETLY COMMITTED I HOPE IT'LL BE THE LAST TIME AS WELL. I I DO FEEL ON THAT ONE OF THEIR COMPLAINTS THIS COMMITTEE HAS HAD. HAS BEEN REALLY THE BEHAVIOR ALL THE REGULATORS AS WELL AS ALL THE DIFFERENT ILLUSTRATIVE AGENCIES. I OFTENTIMES MANY PEOPLE ON DIFFERENT SIDES -- DISCUSS SORT OF FIVE AND TPC OVERSTEPPING THAT'S BEEN ONE OF MY COMPLAINTS IN THE PAST. BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE IF WE AS A GOVERNMENT DON'T GIVE THE CPUC DIRECTION THEN [inaudible] THE THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO PROVIDE THEM DIRECTION THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE. DIRECTION HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE COMMISSIONERS. AND THAT -- THIS IS THE DIRECTION THE SENATOR -- FROM NAPA HAS PROVIDED AYE BUT I BELIEVE IT'S A SENSIBLE PLAN I THINK IT'S A PRUDENT PLAN I DON'T THINK IT OVER STEPS. I THINK I THINK HE'S COMPLETELY CORRECT THAT SHOULD WE HAVE -- A BROADER PLAN IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE END OF SESSION. THAT HIS BILL ARE CAN BE INCORPORATOR THE IDEAS HERE CAN BE INCORPORATED IN SOME. SORT OF LARGER PROGRAMS I THINK IT IS. THAT WE SEE AS A LEGISLATURE THAT WE WE LEGISLATE AND PROVIDE THAT DIRECTION TO THE CPUC. AYE AND THAT THEY DON'T JUST GET TO DECIDE. TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT HOWEVER THEY WANT WHENEVER THEY WANT -- I DO BELIEVE THAT THE CORE CROCKS OF THE OF THE BILL DOES COME IN TWO PARTS WHERE. WE HAVE A PLAN. THE PLANS AGREED UPON WITH THE REGULATE REGULATOR BUT IF. THE PLAN HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IF THE PLAN IS BEING CARRIED OUT THAT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF RECOURSE FOR FOR THE DELAY SO I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OTHERWISE IF YOU HAVE A PLAN. AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY RECOURSE AT THE END I THINK THE PLAN IN OF ITSELF. ISN'T REALLY USE FOR ANYTHING DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE ANY DIRECTION JUST BECOMES JUST ANOTHER. PIECE OF PAPER TO SIT ON TOP OF PILES OF PIECE OF PAPER OVER THE CPUC. THE SO SO THAT IS WHY TODAY AND SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK IT IS A GOOD FIRST STEP INTO WHAT IS -- WHAT IS OCCURRING -- BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO PROVIDE THAT DIRECTION TO THIS COMMISSION. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS OF I THINK IT'S SENATOR DODD. YOU -- HAVE AS I INDICATED EARLIER ON TAKEN ON THE ISSUE AND YOU'VE CERTAINLY BEEN VERY -- THOUGHTFUL IN YOUR APPROACH -- I'VE HIGHLIGHTED SCENARIOS THAT I THINK THIS COMMITTEE -- NEEDS TO BE PRUDENT ON AND NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND HOW WE EVALUATE ALL BILLS THAT COME FORTH ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGER CONTEXT AND I KNOW THAT -- IT IS -- EVERYONE'S EXPECTATION HOPE THAT THE FOCUS OBVIOUSLY IS ON HAVING A CLEAR CONCISE STRATEGY OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SAFETY -- UNDERSTANDING THAT IN THE LARGER CONTEXT OR OTHER. OUR CONVERSATIONS AND OTHER ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE. A FINE POINT PUT ON THEM -- MY HOPE TO HAVE IT IN MORE OF A PIECEMEAL FASHION. AND I THINK THAT WE HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET THERE BEFORE THE END OF THE SESSION -- BUT IN -- UNDERSTANDING THAT -- ADDRESSING AN ISSUE OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED. OF FIRST STEP IS BETTER THAN NO STEP I THINK THAT. IT DEPENDS ON IF YOU'RE ON THE EDGE OF A CLIFF. AND SO IF YOU TAKE THAT NEXT STEP. EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONE STEP. THAT COULD BE A DEADLY STEP. S. SO -- LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- IT APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE SUPPORT. TO KEEP YOUR CONCEPT MOVING I WILL GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME CLOSING THOUGHTS AND THEN WILL. CALL THE ROLL. I APPRECIATE MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE -- YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU IF THAT'S STILL BILL DOES MOVE BECAUSE YOU GET A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA AND LIKE TO WORK WITH THE TO SANTORUM A MERE SU CHI'S -- POINT SECTION. FOR FIFTY ONE IN THIS BILL -- ONE THAT WILL NOT ALLOW. I DID DOES IT DOESN'T MANDATE THAT BECAUSE MY BUT THIS THIS BILL SETS -- FOR REASONABLE THAT'S STATURE DEAD. THEY STILL HAVE THE ULTIMATE DISCRETION. ON ON RATE SETTING THE OTHER THING IS THIS COMMITTEE JUST PASSED SENATOR HILLS BILL WHICH SAYS -- THAT -- IF THERE'S NEGLIGENCE BY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY THE RATEPAYERS WILL NOT PAGE. AND I TOTALLY AGREE. WITH WHO YOU KNOW WITH THAT SENTIMENT WITHOUT POLICY IN FACT I'M A CO AUTHOR. ON SENATOR HILLS BILL I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THE ACCOLADES -- ON MY DISTRICT AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOT FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS. THIS IS NO LONGER ABOUT MY DISTRICT. IT'S OVER THERE THERE'S PAIN THEIR SUFFERING THIS ABOUT YOURS SOME OF YOUR DISTRICTS IN THE FOR IF YOU'RE IN THE VALLEY AND YOU HAVE SOME FOOT HILLS. LET ME TELL YOU CENTER GALLAGHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER YOU POINTED OUT OF THIS FIRE DOES IT NO WAY. SENATE DISTRICTS IT DOESN'T KNOW ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS WE NEED TO GET A MORE RESILIENT GRAD IN THE FUTURE. AND THAT WE ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND WAYS TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THIS IS THAT START I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. AMOUNT OF CLERK TALK CULTURAL. S. B.

THAT IS ADDRESSING -- SOME THE POWER PLANTS THAT WERE BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS WHEN A LOT OF MINUTES BOW OUR GOVERNMENT'S TICKET UPON THEMSELVES WHEN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. ARE EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO -- COULDN'T ON BIGGER THE SIT SITUATION OUT IN OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WERE IN A CRISIS AND WE COULDN'T SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND NOW MANY OF THEM ARE LEFT WITH THAT STRANDED DEBT AND ALL THIS IS. SAN IS ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AT 20% CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THEIR BASE LOW CUSTOMERS AND HELP ALLEVIATE THAT DEBT GOING FOR AND VOTE IN WITH YOUR WITH ME IS GREAT COOK FROM THE NORDIC NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWERS AGENCY. IT'S CHAIR MEMBERS VERY BRIEF THIS IMPORTANT BUILT A THREE UTILITIES AND OTHER IN CALIFORNIA WHO RESPONDED TO THE ENERGY CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE BY ASSURING RELIABILITY IN BUILDING. BUILDING ELECTRICITY PLANTS. THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM WILL. KICK IN WHEN THE A 50% RENEWABLE REQUIREMENT INCREASES AND WILL GO AWAY WITH THE DAY THOSE. BONDS TO PAY -- FOR DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU I'M PARA KEENER WITH THE CITY REDDING REDDING ELECTRIC UTILITY APPRECIATE BEING HERE MAKE YOU JUST A FEW COMMENTS. CHAIRMAN. APPRECIATE CENTER BRADFORD TO AUTHORSHIP OF THIS BILL. OF ALMOST EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF AB EIGHTEEN NINETY A LOT OF UTILITIES WERE LEFT OF HOLDING THE BAG AND SOME OF US MOVE FORWARD AND SPEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BUILD OUR OWN POWER PLANTS. IN ORDER FOR US TO ENSURE RELIABILITY. AND BEING ABLE TO KEEP OUR LIGHTS ON WE HAVE BEEN A PROPONENT OF RENEWABLE POWER. ALL WE ARE STAYING. WITH THE STANDARDS THAT ARE IN PLACE TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. OUT IN THE FUTURE AS OUR PS MOVES FORWARD BUT E NEED SOME HELP RELIEF WITH THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE SPENT WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX MILLION DOLLARS LEFT TO DEBT.

AND THANK YOU AND THAT IT'S A GOOD BILL SO I CAN GO TO THE DETAILS OR YOU KNOW YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY -- IT ALLOWS US TO USE OUR MILITARY. USE YOU ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU ON YOUR WAS SFI THEM THERE IS A SLIGHT MODIFICATION I THINK THAT. WELL THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND AND ALL SAY THEM AND THEN YOU CAN LET ME KNOW. THAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL CLARIFY THE PURPOSE OF THE PILOT. WILL CLARIFY THE FUNDING SOURCE SORTS EPIC UNTIL WE SECURE OR UNLESS WE SECURE A ARE THE FUNDING. CLARIFY THAT ANY REVENUE THAT IS MADE DURING THE PILOTS. WILL BE RE DIRECTED TO EPIC. AND PUSHES BACK THE DATE THAT REGULATORS WOULD CONSIDER GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN IN THE HIGHER P.. UNDER SUBSECTION A AT THE THE LAST LINE I THINK YOUR STAFF A GIVEN US SOME BUT JUST TO STRIKE OUT THAT WE WERE IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS WAS THE LAST LINE THAT I THINK IT READS -- AND USES ELECTRICITY FROM ZERO CARBON [inaudible] ELECTRICITY RESOURCES AND IT -- IN ITS PRODUCTION. AND WE STRUCK THAT -- BASED ON YOUR STAFF'S REQUEST OKAY -- LET ME JUST QUICKLY [inaudible] IN MY YES. THAT IS THE MEMORY PLAN TO TAKE. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME DAY I APPRECIATE THAT -- ANYWAY SO I DECLARE FOR THOSE MOMENTS AND JUST BASICALLY FOR ANYONE WHO IS -- IT THIS DOES ALLOW US TO UTILIZE OUR RENEWABLE GENERATED ELECTRICITY TO THROUGH AN ELECTROLYTIC PROCESS BREAK -- WATER INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN WHICH FREES THE HYDROGEN TO THEN BE USED AS A FUEL FOR FOR STORAGE FOR GREAT PURPOSES. AND IT ALLOWS US TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT WITHOUT ISP RIGHT VOTE AND I HAVE MY WHICH IS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU PLEASE [inaudible] HER PRESENTATION. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL OF THE BRIEF HERE. AT SAID A PLEASURE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS JEFF REED I'M THE CHIEF SCIENTIST FOR RENEWABLE FUELS ENERGY STORAGE AT UC IRVINE. I'M ALSO CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL. SO BOTH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE TO VOICE THEIR STRONG SUPPORT. FOR SENATOR SKINNER'S BILL AND EMPHASIZES THE SINNERS HABIT. ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN CAN PLAY A KEY ROLE. IN SUPPORTING THE DECOLONIZATION OF BOTH ELECTRICITY IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET STARTED ON DEPLOYING THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE NEAR TERM. BEFORE THE NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF SOLUTION BECOMES MORE MORE PRESSING. I IN THE MID PART OF THE TWENTIES BECAUSE AS WE HEARD. FROM SENT EARLIER I SPEAKERS ABOUT THE DUCK CURVE WITH WHICH YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR. THE SOLUTION TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING THAT LAST YEAR. WE CURTAIL JUST ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED GIGAWATT HOURS OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY. BY TWENTY THIRTY THE CPC'S -- INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING TOOL PREDICTS THAT TO GO UP THAT'S ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT OF SIMPLY SPELLING THE ENERGY OF A ONE GIGA WATT. SOLAR PLANT -- THE SYSTEMS ARE BEING DEPLOYED IN EUROPE. AND WE NEED EXPERIENCE OPERATING HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA. TO BRING THESE RESOURCES IN ALONGSIDE OTHERS SERVING SIMILAR PURPOSE IN THIS CONSERVING UNIQUE PURPOSE. IN LONG DURATION INCLUDING UNSEASONAL STORAGE. SO STOP THERE AND ASK FOR A COMMITTEES AYE VOTES. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LORRAINE PASSED SCAT WITH A TRUE NORTH AND AQUA HAIDAR EX. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE HAD A LONG HEARING TODAY. SO AYE WELL AND EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION. CENTER SKINNER FOR TAKING LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HERE TO ANSWER THEM BUT WE'LL JUST KEEP IT SHORT TODAY. BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT SEWER OF WILL WELCOME OF THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADD THEIR VOICES SUPPORT NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE -- STEVE WELCOME AT THE ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA TRANSIT DISTRICT ALSO OWNS. HI ALEX MORRIS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY STORAGE ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. WALKER RIGHT WITH ENGINE NORTH AMERICA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. GREEN NOISE FOR THE LOW CARBON FEELS COALITION IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. REPORTER THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION OUR MAIN CONCERNS WITH THE BILL HAVE RELATE TO THE PROVISION ON INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS. WE APPRECIATE THAT MEN MEANT TODAY AND THAT THE AUTHOR ACCEPTED THEM SUGGESTING THE COMEDIAN ANALYSIS WE DON'T FEEL LIKE A QUITE GOES FAR ENOUGH TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS. AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- FURTHER AMENDMENTS BE ADDED HIGHER P. DATE IS MOVED OUT ANOTHER TWO YEARS AND PROVISION IS MADE FOR THE DATA TO MADE PUBLIC OF THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS. OUR MEMBERS NEED DATA ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY IF THEY'RE GOING TO CONSIDER IN THEIR IRE P. WITHOUT THAT DATA THEY HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW TO CONSIDER THEIR IRE P.. FURTHERMORE WE THINK SOME LANGUAGE WOULD BE NEEDED AND TO ENSURE THAT WHEN IT'S CONSIDERED AN IRP THAT AND COST FEASIBILITY IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS THAT LIKE TO RUIN THEIR OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I WILL TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. DOCTOR QUIRK -- I'M I'M IN THERE. VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS. ALRIGHT NOW I'VE HYDROGEN VEHICLE [inaudible] WITHOUT [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] PROGRAM WE WILL NEVER HAVE HYDROGEN VEHICLES IN THIS STATE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW HYDROGEN COSTS. EQUIVALENT OF EIGHT DOLLARS A GALLON [inaudible] OF GAS IT. WHEN YOU USING THE HYDROGEN? YOU'RE EITHER IT'S GONNA COST YOU WHAT IT WOULD HAVE GAS WAS EIGHT DOLLARS A GALLON TO BE MORE PRECISE. AND HOW CAN WE BRING THAT THAT WELL FIRST OF ALL. RIGHT NOW TWO THIRDS OF THE ELECT OF THE HYDROGEN COUNTRY NATURAL GAS. IF THIS IS GONNA WORK IN THE LONG RUN IT HAS TO COME FROM ELECTROLYSIS WHICH IS WHAT YOUR BILL IS PILOTING. AND FURTHERMORE WE JUST DON'T KNOW UNTIL WE SCALE OP. HOW WELL THIS WILL WORK NOW I CAN TALK I HAVE TALKED WITH TECHNOLOGISTS? TO FAST AND KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS AND THEY SAY -- WE'VE REALLY GOTTEN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN USE VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF PLATINUM AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT EXPENSIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY THAT MUCH ABOUT THE END NODES IN THE CAFETERIA AND TO BE REPLACED IN THE CHANNEL TO SCALE UP. AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT GIVES US. THE FIRST PART OF THE SCALE. IT'S NOT ALL THE WAY SCALE UP BUT IT'S THE NEXT STEP. AND WITHOUT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WE WON'T SCALE UP WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL ELECTRIC CARS ARE GOING TO BE GOOD FOR PEOPLE COMMUTE SMALLER DISTANCES -- PEOPLE WHO HAVE READILY OF IT READY AVAILABILITY OF CHARGING BUT THAT'S JUST NOT EVERYBODY. AND SOME PEOPLE WILL NEVER ADOPTED AND SO. WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE ELECTROLYSIS OF HYDROGEN AND HYDROGEN VEHICLES IN MY OPINION. AS A SECOND OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE RANGE ANXIETY FOR PEOPLE WITH HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. BOB THAT'S ONE USE THE OTHER THAT I HEARD -- TALKED ABOUT BY SUPPORTERS WAS STORAGE -- YES BATTERIES YOU'RE GOOD IN SOME WAYS BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEASONAL STORAGE. WHICH AT SOME POINT IF WE HAVE ENOUGH SOLAR IT'S A DIRECTION WE GO IN. THEN HYDROGEN IS A GOOD WAY TO GO. SO FOR THOSE MANY REASONS I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. I IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL PRESERVE SECOND. HOW SENATOR WE APPRECIATE YOUR ALWAYS FORWARD THINKING IN THESE ISSUES AND WE? LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR BILL DO PASS. TO A NATURAL RESOURCES WITH THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD BEEN ACCEPTED WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU PREACH HATE TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE AND* FOR NOT BOTH -- SO THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE TAKEN A NATURAL RESOURCE. BUT IS A DO PASS [inaudible] LOCAL. HOLDEN HIGH HOLDEN AYE PATTERSON.

SB FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR WHAT SUPPORT AND ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF BATTERY ELECTRIC TRANSIT BUSES BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO INITIATE A RATE MAKING PROCEEDING THAT ADDRESSES THE HIGH COST OF ELECTRICITY AS A FUEL. TRANSIT AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA OR REPLACING CONVENTIONAL FUEL TRANSIT BUSES WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC TRANSIT BUSES. HE TRANSIT AS TRANSIT AGENCIES MOVED TO AND SCALE UP THEIR DEPLOYMENT A BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES. MANY HAVE FOUND THAT THE COST OF ELECTRICITY FAR EXCEEDS CONVENTIONAL FUEL. IN FACT SOME TRANSIT AGENCIES HAVE FOUND THAT THE COST OF FUEL PER MILE FOR ELECTRIC BUSES CAN BE 40% TO TWO TIMES HIGHER THE NATURAL GAS AND DIESEL FUEL. THIS HIGH COST REMAINS TRUE EVEN WITH STATE INCENTIVES SUCH AS THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION WITH FOR WHICH REPRESENTS MORE THAN EIGHTY TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IS ONE OF THE TOP THREE BARRIERS. TO TRANSIT ELECTRIFICATION THE HIGH COST OF ELECTRICITY AS A FUEL IS PREVENTING AND SLOWING THE ADOPTION OF CLEANER ENERGY TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS VITAL TO ME THE STATE'S S. B. THIRTY TWO GOALS. REDUCING PETROLEUM USED BY 50% BY TWENTY THIRTY AND IMPROVING OUR STATE'S AIR QUALITY. AS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD RECENTLY IS CURRENTLY ADVANCING REGULATIONS REQUIRE ALL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION BUSES THE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION HAS BECOME MORE URGENT. S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S GOALS OF TRANSITIONING TO CLEANER ENERGY AND REDUCING TOXIC POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR. I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO ENSURE THE BILL DOES NOT DELAY OTHER. ONGOING EFFORTS TO SUPPORT TRANSIT ELECTRIFICATION AND I HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT HERE WITH ME TODAY [inaudible] RIGHT [inaudible] COME. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL HIMSELF CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION. THE ASSOCIATION IS A SPONSOR OF S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY FOUR SENATOR LEYVA DID A GOOD JOB OF SUMMARIZING THE INTENT BEHIND S. B.

ZERO MISSION BUS DEPLOYMENT WE ANTICIPATE THE CPUC WOULD STILL ADHERE TO MANY OF THEIR LONG STANDING UP PRINCIPLES A GOVERNING REDESIGN IN DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE. A NEW RATES WERE TRANSIT AGENCIES WITH PHYLLIS CONVERSATIONS IMPORTANT FOR PREVENTING ELECTRICITY RATES FROM SLOWING THE ADOPTION ZERO EMISSION BUSES. AND WE ASK YOUR AYE THAT THANK YOU. I'M MORE COMMANDING -- I'M FROM LA METRO -- I'M GLAD TO BE HERE IN -- SO -- AND SENIOR DIRECTOR VEHICLE ENGINEERING AND ACQUISITION FRAWLEY METRO AND WE ARE.

AS MENTIONED THERE APPEAR AGENCIES THAT I'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT ELECTRIC A BOSS COULD BE SIXTY EIGHT TO A 100% MORE THAN THE INCUMBENT TECHNOLOGY THE CNG OR DIESEL -- JUST TO SAY FROM LA METROS POINT OF VIEW WE SPENT TWENTY THREE MILLION AND CNG JUST LAST YEAR. THAT MEANS WE WOULD SPEND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ELECTRICITY COSTS IF WE DO NOT HAVE A GUARANTEED TRANSIT FRIENDLY RIGHT -- AYE I PREVIOUSLY JUST CAME FROM CHICAGO TRANSIT WE WERE GRAPPLING WITH THE SAME ISSUE WITH OUR ELECTRIC BUSES -- WE ALSO DID HAVE SOME TRANSIT FRIENDLY RIGHT AS WELL FOR OUR WELL OUR RAILROADS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT SO THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A COST EFFECTIVE.

AND I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK YOUR STAFF -- TO WERE FOR YOUR STAFF WORKING WITH US ON THIS -- THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW THIS IS-- A VERY IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL PUT CALIFORNIA. ON A NEW PATH WITH REGARDS. TO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. EVERY DAY WERE SEEN -- THE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE WERE SEEN. ANIMALS ACTUALLY MIGRATING NORTHWARD WERE SEEN. BOB WILDFIRES -- RAVAGING PARTS OF OUR STATE MOVING. EVERY YEAR CLINTON FURTHER NORTH AND THEN A ELIMINATING OUR FORESTS WERE SEEN -- THE AFFECTS [inaudible] OF OF GHGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSING CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING CAUSING. EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER AT TAKING ON POLICIES THAT IT IMPROVE AIR QUALITY THAT -- THERE'LL LEADING THE WORLD IN REDUCE SEEN [inaudible] CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THIS BILL IS A BILL THAT -- BRINGS CALIFORNIA [inaudible] MUCH CLOSER TO CONTINUE AND ACHIEVE THAT -- THIS LEGISLATURE STARTED ITS WORK. ON THE CARBONIZATION OF THE ELECTRIC SECTOR. TO THE ADOPTION OF STATUTORY. OUR PROCUREMENT MANDATES FOR RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY WE'VE GONE THROUGH. THIS A RENEWABLE ENERGY REVOLUTION IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT ONLY CREATE JOBS BUT ALSO HAS HOT HELPED US. IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND HELP A FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND TODAY WE CAN SAY THAT WERE A HEAD OF SCHEDULE. TO GET 50% RENEWABLE ACT LICKED TRICITY A BY TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE MAKING HUGE CHANGES. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF OUR OF OUR ECONOMY THAT WE NEED TO CUT DE CARBONIZED. AN AREA WHERE WE USE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND THAT'S NATURAL GAS CALIFORNIA STILL EXPORTS. IMPORTS 80% OF OUR NATURAL GAS EVERY TIME WE USE NATURAL GAS AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S MONEY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOING TO SOME. FOREIGN ENTITIES SOME OTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY OTHER PART OF THE STATE. AND THAT'S LESS MONEY. THAT WERE RECIRCULATING INTO OUR OWN ECONOMY. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WHEN I GOT THE SENATE WAS I STARTED THE SELECT COMMITTEE. ON OUR ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT HELPS US GET [inaudible] TO CLOSER TO BECOME ENERGY INDEPENDENT. TODAY WE HAVE A VERY LARGE INDUSTRY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INVESTING. IN CREATING A RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THESE ARE COMPANIES THERE ARE. ARE CAPTURING METHANE TURNING INTO POWER POWERING -- ALTOS THEIR POWER POWER IN INDUSTRY. AND AND WE NEED. TO TAP INTO THAT KNOWLEDGE TAP INTO THAT INDUSTRY TO HELP CLEAN CALIFORNIA'S AARON HELP FUEL. OUR FUTURE. WE'VE DONE AWESOME WORK IN THIS BILL A RECENTLY -- RECENTLY ARE WE WE PASSED S. B.. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THAT WHICH WAS OFFERED ARE AUTHORED BY SENATOR RICARDO LARA WHICH WILL DIVORCE DIVERT 75%. OF ORGANIC WASTE FROM LANDFILLS AND REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY THIS IS OUR A A VERY AMBITIOUS BILL. BUT A BILL THAT IS MUCH NEEDED AND A BILL THAT NEEDS. ARE A PATHWAY TO BE IMPLEMENTED MY BILL WOULD WOULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN IMPLEMENTING. THIS PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A MARKET. FOR FOR THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IN A WAY. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROCURE THIS IN STATE. SO -- I JUST WANTED -- TO S. EXPRESS THAT UP I KNOW THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. THE THE PRICE YOU PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. AND THEY ARE -- EXTREMELY CONFUSING I UNDERSTAND AND WE'VE MADE LOTS OF CHANGES TO THAT BUT IT'S BEEN A KIND OF A PROCESS BY WHICH WE'VE. WE'VE ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION OF WORKS TO MAKE SENSE. THAT IS IMPLEMENTABLE THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE ACCOMPLISHED. AND IT'S BEEN A HARD ROAD GETTING HERE AND WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH HIM AS CHAIR YOU HAVE SOME AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM TODAY. FOR THE PURPOSES OF WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THOSE AND I I KNOW THAT. WE WE WILL NEED SOME LEVEL OF OF COST CONTAINMENT AND COST CAPS AND ARE YOU UNDERSTOOD USE SPORT THAT. I SUPPORT THAT I WON'T I WON'T WORK ON THIS BILL WITHOUT THAT WE NEED TO CONTROL THE COSTS THAT ARE PASSED. PASSED ON RATEPAYERS. A THAT'S GONNA BE A VERY ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS BILL -- SO I'M I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT. BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE -- PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE A LOT MORE EXPERTISE AND ON THIS THAN I DO THAT ARE WILLING TO KIND OF SHARE. SOME OF THEIR SOME OF THEIR EXPERTISE WITH THIS COMMITTEE SO THAT YOU -- KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND AND AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE -- TO TYPE I APPRECIATE FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED -- VISIONARY THINKING AROUND HOW TO EXPAND OUR RENEWABLES IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT WE MIGHT -- START START TO EXPLORE AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND THE AMENDMENT -- FOR CLARITY THAT WERE. ARE PROPOSING WHICH WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. A IS STRIKING ON PAGE -- EIGHT LINES. EIGHTEEN TO FORTY AND ALL OF PAGE. NINE NOW THE RESULTS THE RESULT OF THAT WOULD BE. THE BILL WOULD BE DIRECT WOULD DIRECT. AKAR. DEVELOPER PROCUREMENT MANDATE PROGRAM. WITHOUT THE USE OF RACE CLEAR THOUGHTS. BUT TO YOUR POINT IN TERMS OF CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE COST CONTAINMENT WEEK. THAT'S THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO HAPPEN DA OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] YEAH. DID YOU WANNA HEAR SOME WEST WITNESS TESTIMONY. PLEASE OF WE WILL WILL CO HEAD INJURY AT THE REQUIREMENT THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS FOR THE PROUD SPONSORS THE SAW AND LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR -- AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL FOR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH US ON APPROPRIATE COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES AND WE THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. I ACTUALLY HAD A FEW OF MY MEMBERS FLY IN FROM OUT HOUND SO I'LL BE YIELDING MY TIME SO THAT ON THEY CAN. ADDRESS YOU THINK YOU. FLYING IN FROM ONTARIO IS NOT THAT BIG A FLIGHT BUT YEAH MINDS ROB STRANGE WORK FOR FOUR STAR ENERGY AND TWO STAR ENERGY -- WHERE A ON? WELL. WE I'M NATIONWIDE FIRM THAT DOES. SUPPORTS A LOW CARBON ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WE HAVE THIRTY THREE LEVEL GAS ENERGY PLANTS CROSS COUNTRY. WE HAVE A THREE YEAR COGENERATION PLANTS AND FIVE BIOMASS FACILITIES. AND I JUST WANNA SAY THAT. GET A WERE FLARE MORE GAS IN THE STATE TWICE AS MUCH MORE GAS IN THE STATE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. I MEAN AND WE NEED TO OUR FIGURE OUT WHAT WE GONNA DO WITH ALL NOTHING LARS BILL WAS GREAT MARGRET. KEEP THE ORGANICS FROM GOING IN THE LANDFILL. BUT THE AVERAGE GAS CURVE IN A LANDFILL THIS IS OUR BUSINESS MY GUESS IS STILL THERE -- EFFECT WE DON'T PUT A MORE IN DOES MAKE ANYMORE. BUT THE ORGANICS PROCESS OF DECOMPOSING IN MAKING THAT METHANE TAKES TWENTY YEARS AS WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THIS GAS IN THE MEANTIME -- ALSO FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WITH WITH AG IN THEIR DISTRICTS -- THE FARMERS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL HAVE -- ORGANICS IN THEIR PART OF THEIR WASTE STREAM AND THAT ORGANICS A OUR OUR GOING TO BE -- SHORT LIVE CLIMATE PRETTY POLLUTANTS AND WE'RE CAPTURING THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE USING. TO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT RENEWABLE BIOGAS THAT'S WHAT IT IS. I THINK VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. MANY OTHERS OF LIKE. TO BUT ATTENTION AND WOULD JUST RIGHT AND IF YOU KEEP IT IN A ONE TO TWO MINUTES BRIEFLY I THANK YOU A CHECK TIM CARMICHAEL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THIS BILL ON ITS DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORTING ALL ALONG -- I WANT TO SPEAK JUST TO A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS -- THIRD PERSON BEEN SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THIS BILL BEING. PREMATURE WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS CORRECT OF THIS SPACE THIS ENERGY SPACE IS MOVING RAPIDLY THERE DOZENS OF PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT WITHIN CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULD HELP US FACILITATE THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION AND USE OF THOSE PROJECTS GOING FORWARD -- THAT'S WHY ONE OF THE REASONS WE'VE BEEN SO KEEN. TO SUPPORT THIS BILL ON HEARD THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN. YOU AND SENATOR OF THE AUTHOR ABOUT OTHER PROVISIONS THAT. YEAR YOU'D LIKE TO SEE REMOVED WERE BUT THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE COST CONTROLS AND THE RATE FACING PROVISIONS ARE. TO THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED THEIR INCLUSION -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WE HOPE TO TRY AND ADDRESS THOSE -- OTHERWISE WE'RE LOOKING AT SITUATION WHERE THERE'D BE A PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT -- A MECHANISM TO REALLY PAY FOR IT AND THAT'S A BIG CONCERN. FOR US BUT THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS UP MIND SHOPPERS OLEUM ASSET MANAGER FOR OUR ENERGY ON A MISSION AND A WOMAN THE LARGEST PRODUCERS OF OUR ENERGY IN THE COUNTRY AND WERE A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE TRANSPORTATION FUELS MARKET. WERE ALSO MAJOR SUPPLIER -- IN SUPPORT OF THE OUR PS IN CALIFORNIA HERE SO WE WE SUPPLY OF NUMEROUS MUNICIPALITIES IN CALIFORNIA -- WE PROCESSED OVER FIFTY ABBY CF OF OUR ENGINES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT'S EQUIVALENT OF SIXTY FIVE MILLION DE THREE RENTS -- THAT'S LIKE TAKING A FORMALLY CARS OFF THE ROAD WE TOOK SEVENTEEN MILLION TONS OF CO TWO OUT OF THE BY THE ATMOSPHERE LAST YEAR -- WE WE DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON THE ANALYSIS FROM THE COMEDIAN AL SAYS THAT PIPELINE INJECTED COST IS IS NOT IT COST COMPETITIVE. OF THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE BIFURCATION OF THE COMMODITY AND MP AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES MAKING THE NATURAL GAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LAST -- BUT SO MARKETS ARE FAR MORE MATURE THAN THE ENERGY MARKETS AND SO IT'S HARD TO PREDICT WHAT THAT FUTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE -- BUT POSTLE PRICES -- PICKED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE OVER FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND WE'RE OVER. TWELVE AS RECENTLY AS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THIS IS SMART POLICY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS -- CALIFORNIA DIVERSIFY ITS NATURAL GAS SUPPLY -- ARE IT WILL HAVE ON NINE PROJECTS IN PRODUCTION AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ANOTHER SEVEN OR IN DEVELOPMENT AND TO WHICH ARE IN CALIFORNIA. ON THIS BILL WILL HELP GET THOSE PROJECTS MOVING. UP PASSING SB FOURTEEN FORTY PROVIDES. CRITICAL CERTAINTY IN THE MARKET AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL -- PASSING SB FORTY FORTY WOULD CREATE A HUNDRED FIFTY NEW RG PROJECTS WITH A CAPITAL EXPENDITURE OF UP TO TEN POINT FIVE BILLION [inaudible] THANK YOU.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK A PRAYER ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE AUTHOR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US AND ALL THE OTHER STATE. A STAKEHOLDERS -- ON THIS PROCESS BEFORE WE HAVE VISITED WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AND OTHERS -- IN OUR OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION WE DID SIT DOWN WITH THE AUTHORS. STAFF AND LET THEM KNOW THAT -- WITH THE BILL SET BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE HAD TO A AYE AYE INDICATE WHERE WE ARE. WANT TO POINT OUT THAT FROM A REPUBLIC STAND FOR PLOT POINT WE ARE -- WE WERE AN EARLY SUPPORTER OF SP THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE I BELIEVE WE WERE THE FIRST SOLID WASTE COMPANY. TO TAKE THAT POSITION AND SO WERE VERY -- ACT -- SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF ADDRESSING -- METHANE AND REDUCING THE AND THAT S. FOURTEEN FORTY WOULD CREATE A BIAS AGAINST A BIO METHANE FROM LANDFILL GAS PROJECTS. I THE BILL PRIORITIZES HIGH COSTS IN GAS I PRODUCED BY COMMERCIAL WE BELIEVE ARE COMMERCIALLY UNPROVEN. STAFF THERMAL GASIFICATION AT GASIFICATION AND WE ARE CONCERNED. THAT THIS BILL INCLUDES SYNGAS PRODUCED BY GASIFICATION. YEAH IN THE EXISTING STE -- STATUTORY DEFINITION OF BIOGAS I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE CONSTITUENCIES OF BIOGAS. WHY ARE 5275% METHANE -- SYNGAS HAS NO METHANE AT ALL AND SO I WOULD WANT TO POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT. I WE SEEM TO BE TRYING TO BUY CO MINGLING THESE I THINK WE ARE DOING -- BIO METHANE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING AYE IN USE AT A DISSERVICE AND SO WE WOULD URGE AYE WE PRESENTED SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD CLARIFY THOSE DEFINITIONS -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND WITH THE OTHER BODIES AND IN THE ASSEMBLY TO GET THIS BILL RIGHT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS INGRID ROSTRUM I'M WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUP ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF KERN COUNTY RESIDENTS. ON THIS BILL CREATES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO SPUR MORE METHANE. TO CONSOLIDATE AND INCREASE HEARD AND SUBSIDIZE THE LARGEST AND MOST POLLUTING CARRIES ON MANY OF WHICH OCCUR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- RATHER -- THEN LOOK AT WAYS OF DEALING WITH EXISTING METHANE AYE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE PRIORITIZE AND PRACTICES THAT REDUCE METHANE GENERATION IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT COULD INCLUDE. MOVEMENT TOWARD DRY MANURE MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN THE WET MANURE MANAGEMENT THAT WE CURRENTLY SEEING CALIFORNIA. I DAIRIES HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF LOCALIZED IMPACTS ON RESIDENTS IN THE CENTER VALLEY INCLUDING KERN AND TULARE. ON AND THESE RESIDENTS OR EIGHTY SUFFER FROM A COMMUNITY CUMULATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL -- POLLUTION BIRD. ON BY INCENTIVIZING LARGER DAIRIES AND LARGER HEARD SIZES ON INCREASING NOTHING PRODUCTION AND THAT'LL LEAD TO ACTING AT INCREASED LOCALIZED IMPACTS INCLUDING. A WORSE AIR QUALITY -- POOR WATER QUALITY AND INCREASED VOTER ISSUES -- FOR THESE REASONS OUT WE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT OPPOSE POSITION. I THINK IF. THANK YOU OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE. TO NAME AND WAS CHAIRMAN JOHN WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL WOULD POSE LESS AMENDED BECAUSE WE THINK THE BILL -- NARROWS THE DEFINITION OF RENEWABLE GAS THAT WAS IN. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WE THINK IT SHOULD INCLUDE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN ALONG WITH THE OTHER PRODUCTS WE HOPE TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT ISSUE THANK YOU. PHOEBE SEEN LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE'LL LINE OUR COMMENT WAS SENT ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT ESPECIALLY CONCERNED. ABOUT THE IMPACTS FROM DAIRIES ON NON NEARBY COMMUNITIES IN THE REGION AND WE ALSO FEEL THAT THIS BILL IS PREMATURE AND THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN REALLY THE IMPACTS ON THE COST EFFECTIVENESS. OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS SPEWS. FAN OF US IS THAT CALIFORNIA RAMTHA JUST SCIENCE WE ALSO AND OUR SOULS WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AND ALSO WITH CENTER PROTEIN ARMINDO COMMENTS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND OUR OPPOSITION IS ALIGNED WITH THAT OF THE CENTER FOR RACE POVERTY THE ENVIRONMENT. A MAN ON THE US EUROPE OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. CHAIR MEMBERS GREAT COOK WAS INTO THE CALIFORNIA POWER EIGHT TO SEE WE HAVE BEEN IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF OF THE HARD WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE TO TRY TO BRING THE PARTIES TOGETHER. AND FORCE THE WHEN IT WAS A DO SO BUT WITH THE AMENDMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND WHERE ADOPTED THIS AFTERNOON WE WILL WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION. AND ALEXANDER ON BEHALF OF SMOG WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN PRINT UNLESS AMENDED AND WE WILL -- LOOK FOR TO ANALYZING THE AMENDMENTS WHEN THEY'RE OUT THINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR KEVIN HALL I'M UP FROM FRESNO FOR THE DAY ENOUGH EN MASSE FOR NINETY SECONDS OF YOUR TIME -- I'M A FORMER AGRICULTURE I WORKED IN INDUSTRY FOR MORE THAN THIRTEEN YEARS I'M A LIFELONG VALLEY RESIDENTS. AIR POLLUTION THE CLIMATE CHANGE ARE MY TOP CONCERNS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. I THINK YOU RECOGNIZE PROBABLY MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE HERE IMPACTED AREAS ON ONE'S AND AIR DISTRICT AND AIR BASIN AND THE MOVEMENT FROM CHINO HILLS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY OF THE MEGA DAIRY INDUSTRY HAS HAD A DRAMATIC IMPACT. WITH A POPULATION OF FOUR MILLION PEOPLE. WE HAVE A THOUSAND AREAS. THEY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY ONE FOURTH OF 1% OF THE POPULATION. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIVE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS THAT OUR AIR DISTRICT TO SUPPOSED TO CONTROL. TERRY'S ALONE ACCOUNT FOR A FULL YET THOSE. ONE THOUSAND MAJOR SOURCES OF POLLUTION YOUR ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE TITLE FIVE PERMITS. SO THE NOTION THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PUT MONEY INTO THAT INDUSTRY -- IS IS I THINK A A BACKWARDS MOVE. AND SECONDLY I THINK THAT WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND IT'S A VERY FRAGILE INDUSTRY. A DECADE AGO THERE A THIRTEEN HUNDRED IN THE VALLEY I'M AND I'M SORRY I I SORRY BUT A BIT. THE TESTIMONY PART HAS CEASED AYE I GAVE YOU A LITTLE AT A TWO THANK YOU I'M GONNA HAVE TO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU -- WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE QUESTIONS FOR MAYBE. OF THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU -- SENATOR. FOR BRINGING YOUR BILL FORWARD I SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT -- IMPACT ON THE RATE PAYERS AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT -- I UNDERSTAND THE THE BILL -- AS I ASSUME IT WILL BE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION -- I ALSO WANTED TO ASK YOU -- GIVEN THAT THIS BILL WILL BE GOING. TO MY COMMITTEE NEXT -- NATURAL RESOURCES -- A POINT THAT -- MY STAFF HAD POINT -- REYES. AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU WHY THIS BILL IS REQUIRING THE A A RP RATHER THAN THE PC -- TO SET THE TERMS OF THE BY A METHANE PROCUREMENT. CAN I ASK A ETHNIC PORTA ANSWER SO THERE'S TWO REASONS -- TICKLISH WITH MY REASONS CHAIRMAN RICHARD YOU -- ONE THIS IS ACTUALLY AN AMENDMENT WAS REQUIRED BY SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IT'S NEW YEARS ALL VERSION OF THE BILL DID IDENTIFY THE CPU SEE -- HOWEVER THERE IS A REPORT THAT WAS DONE -- IN THE INTEGRATED ENERGY POLICY REPORT THAT'S DEVELOPED BY THE CDC I'M PERIODICALLY AND IT DID MAKE A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE A ARE BE -- ENGAGE IN CREATING BOTH PROCUREMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS TO INCENTIVIZE ADDITIONAL USE OF RENEWABLE GAS IN THE STATE AND SO CONSISTENT WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION THE CHANGE WAS MADE -- ALTHOUGH THAT THE BILL AND PRINT DOES HAVE THE CPUC IMPLEMENTING ALL RATE PAIR RELATED AND UTILITY RELATED PIECES OF THE BILL IT WOULD JUST BE AIR BE SETTING THE TARGET [inaudible] OKAY. WELL. DUMB SO I APPRECIATE THAT EXPLANATION IN THE HISTORY ARM ALL BE -- OF FURTHER EXPLORING THAT ISSUE AS A CONCERN NATURAL RESOURCES AYE BY MAYBE OF STANDING ON THE THE BILL TODAY -- BUT IF YOU NEED MY VOTE YOU HAVE MY VOTE -- SO THERE'S PEOPLE WHO SAY THE BIO DATA DAIRY INDUSTRY IS. POLLUTING THEY DON'T SEEM TO LIKE IT -- IN MY OPINION WHAT YOUR BILL WILL DO WE JUST REDUCE POLLUTION FROM THE DAIRY INDUSTRY. AND ASIDE FROM -- YOU KNOW. I THINK IT'S THE BEST THING THAT CAN BE DONE UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO GET RID OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY PERHAPS YOU COULD AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH ME ON THAT. WELL ABSOLUTELY I MEAN OF I THINK GENERALLY PEOPLE. THAT -- ARE CRITICAL OF OF THIS BILL DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND KIND OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND BY OF METHANE AND HOW. IT ACTUALLY HAS A NAY IT OUT BY USING GOING TO BUY A MATH THING YOU ACTUALLY GO INTO. A IN TERMS OF MEASURING THE IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT YOU COULD INTO NEGATIVE IMPACTS WHERE. IT'S ACTUALLY HELPING TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IF THE MORE BY A MY THING YOU YOU USE YOUR ACTUALLY PROVING OR QUALITY SO YOU READ. WHAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE -- METHANE GOING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT NATURALLY YOU'RE CAPTURING ALL EUROPE PREVENTING THAT FROM GOING INTO SO IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA THAT'S IMPACTED BY. BY DAIRY INDUSTRY YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE. THOSE AREAS CLEANER RANK AT AND I I MEAN. THAT'S NOT JUST GONNA HAPPEN ON ITS OWN YOU ACTUALLY NEED A PROGRAM TO DO THAT PROGRAMS COST MONEY. AND YOU GOTTA FIND A WAY TO COMFORT THAT ENERGY INTO A USABLE FORM. BUT YOU KNOW FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT THEIR RATE PAYERS ARE GOING TO BE FUNDING THIS. THEY'RE REPAIRS ARE GOING TO BE ALSO EMPLOYED BY THIS. SO IT'S KIND OF A A CIRCLE IN THAT YOU'RE RECYCLING. A DOLLARS INSIDER STATE INSTEAD OF STANDING EVERY TIME. I USE NATURAL GAS ON MY STOVE I'M ACTUALLY SENDING MY MONEY. TO EITHER AUSTRALIA OR CANADA OR SOME OTHER PART OF THE WORLD BUT NOT CALIFORNIA WE'RE CREATING JOBS THERE. BUT WE'RE NOT CREATING JOBS HERE. AND AND THERE IS A FINANCIAL BENEFIT TO THAT THERE'S SUCH A MEASURABLE. BENEFIT TO OUR ECONOMY THAT WHEN YOU LOOKED SIMPLY LOOK AT IT SAID THIS IS GOING INCREASED COSTS YOU BUT THIS IS ALSO THE INCREASE JOBS. AND IF YOU JUST TOOK THE COST PART OF IT OUT. I BET WE TOOK IT OUT WHAT THE WHAT THE WHAT THE INTENT OF OF FURTHER WORKING ON IT TO ENSURE A WE WE WE WANNA. I THINK THE CHAIRMAN AND I COULD AGREE THAT WE WANT. BUT THERE IS NO WAY FORWARD ON THIS BILL WITHOUT SOME KIND OF OF WAY TO A INCENTIVIZE. THE CREATION OF THESE JOBS THE INCENTIVIZE IT AND IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN ON ITS OWN IF IT DID WE WOULDN'T NEED THIS BUT WE WANT TO BE TALK NEAR. YEAH WHAT IN OUR STARTED SOLAR WE WANNA START IT NGUYEN IN CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT WITHOUT COMING UP WITH MANDATES LIKE THIS ONE WITHOUT COMING UP WITH WAYS. TO FUND THESE PROJECTS BUT NOW. IT'S BECOME THE MOST COMPETITIVE ENERGY SOURCE I THINK WE'RE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION BUT WE GOT TO GIVE IT A LITTLE NUDGE. AND THEN AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO NOT ONLY CREATE A VERY COMPETITIVE. INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO HELPING TO ADDRESS OUR ENVIRONMENT PROBLEMS THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF THIS THAT SAYS. WE HAVE A PILOT PROGRAM. WHY DO YOU FEEL THIS IS AND DID NEEDED IN ADDITION TO THE PILOT PROGRAM? YOU WANNA CHECK INTO CHAIR PLEASE SOFAS. THERE IS AN ON GOING PILOT -- AT THIS TPC AT THAT DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH DAIRY PROJECTS NOW IS DONE UP PURSUANT TO S. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHERE THERE WAS SOME QUESTION THERE HADN'T BEEN ANY DAIRY PROJECTS AS OF YET. IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE INTERCONNECTED AND THE DAIRY INDUSTRY WAS ABLE -- TO WORK TOGETHER WITH SENATOR LARA -- TO CREATE A PILOT MECHANISM WHERE THAT'S NOT WHAT SENATOR HUESO IS IS -- PROPOSING FOR THIS BILL IT SOUNDS SOMETHING MORE CONSISTENT WITH 50% WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT IT WAS IT WAS A DAIRY SPECIFIC PILOT ON THAT BEING SAID SO THERE ARE OTHER SECTORS HERE WASTE WATER LANDFILL ENDEAVORED ORGANIC WASTE THAT ARE ENVISIONED NONE OF THOSE ARE SUBJECT TO THE PILOT. THEY HAD BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED THE COSTS ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD IN CALIFORNIA OF THOSE SECTORS -- AND SO GOES BEYOND DARIAN ALSO IN THAT SAME THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REPORT THAT WAS DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. IT ACTUALLY SAYS -- YES EPC SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THEIR PILOTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME AIR BE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD ON PROCUREMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND WE DID A CLARIFY THAT WITH THE CDC TO MAKE SURE. THEY DIDN'T MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE PREMATURE AND AND THEY DID CONFIRM THAT FOR US. THAT'S WHY GOING. I WASN'T CHAIRMAN A TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY TO ONE INDUSTRY. THE SOLID WASTE RECYCLING INDUSTRY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE HAVE TWENTY MILLION TONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO COME OUT OF THE LANDFILL BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND GROWING. SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AVENUES THAT'S NOT A PILOT PROGRAM AYE IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIRED. US ALL THE MUNICIPALITIES ALL THE COUNTIES AND ALL OF THEIR PROVIDERS I TO TAKE THIS OUT OF THE LANDFILL SO THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL PIECE THAT WILL MOVE THAT FORWARD. WE THINK COST CONTAINMENT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BUT AS THE SENATOR SAID THERE HAS TO BE AN INCENTIVE AND THIS IS THAT INCENTIVE SO RELEASE HELP US DO WHAT THE LAW THAT YOU ALL PASSED -- WITH SENATOR LARA DID YOU AND TO ME IT ACTUALLY IS THE LANDFILL PART. BECAUSE IT IS UTTERLY UNCONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING. AND RIGHT NOW THE METHANE WE HAVE. OVER THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS COMING OUT. IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE. AND AGAIN IT'S A MATTER OF CALIFORNIA LEADING THE WAY SHOWING THAT THIS CAN BE DONE. I YOU HAVE TO PUT SOME MONEY IN THE BEGINNING WITH I AM CONCERNED THAT THE MONEY WAS NOW TAKEN OUT BUT WELL WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PROCESS GOES ALONG -- ANYWAY I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. IS THERE A MOTION TO TO MOVE THE BILL. ITSELF. OKAY NOW IT'S MOVED OUT. I WAS [inaudible] THE ISSUE AND I HAD TO WHICH IS SIR. A SENATOR -- COULD YOU ADDRESS THE CONCERNED THAT THAT THIS PROCUREMENT MANDATE WOULD -- INCENTIVIZE -- METHANE GENERATION RATHER THAN MET METHANE AVOIDANCE WELL. HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE. DOES THAT MEAN THE MOST MORE PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANNA. THROW OUR TRASH IN THE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA INCENTIVE WE'RE GONNA MONETIZE -- RENEWABLE MATCH GETS MORE PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANNA THROW TRASH IN LANDFILLS NO WELL A FOR EXAMPLE I'M LOOKING AT A A NASCAR LETTER HERE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WHERE -- THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT I I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND LIKE I SAID. THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT WHEN YOU CREATE A LAW SAYING THAT -- YOU KNOW WORK ON BIG THE ENCOURAGE -- A A SPECIFIC INDUSTRY WILL NET NATURAL GAS TO DEVELOP. THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANT ONE TO THROW TRASH. WELL THERE ARE CONCERNED THAT LOOK YOU PUT A FIGURE ON IT AND MORE PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANNA. ENGAGE IN THAT ACTIVITY THAT'S WHY. INITIALLY -- THERE'S A CAP ON ON THE PART. TRYING TO GET AT THE THE AMOUNT OF GAS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE OUT THERE AND IT'S NOT. I I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD ARGUMENT BECAUSE OF I MEAN WHAT'S THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THAT ARGUMENT MORE PEOPLE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW HAS EVER TALK ABOUT DAIRIES AND INCENTIVIZING LARGER HERD SIZES. AND AND THAT'S THE THING YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL DO THAT AB OUT OF THE CAR HAS ASKING A PRODUCING MILK. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SELL MORE GAS I I I DON'T KNOW MAY BE MICHAEL YOU WANT A TICKET. I JUST DON'T MICHAEL VOCAL OR ON THEY HAVE TO THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS I WORK CLOSELY WITH BOTH THE DAIRY INDUSTRIES IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY DEVELOPERS AND THERE'S NO -- REALISM TO THE CONCERN THAT THIS IS GOING TO INCENTIVIZE LARGER DAIRIES. THEORIES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING CALIFORNIA FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE HAVE FEWER DAIRIES -- AND THAT'S A TRULY UNFORTUNATE THING IT'S A COMBINATION OF OF YOU KNOW HOME REQUIREMENTS IN LABOR COSTS AND OTHERS THAT ARE CONSOLIDATING THE INDUSTRY. THERE IS NO INCENTIVE WHATSOEVER TO ADD COWS TO YOUR DAIRY TO PRODUCE MORE METHANE SO YOU CAN SELL IT UNDER THIS BILL RIGHT THAT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY CRAZY TALK. THANK. ON THAT NOTE -- SENATOR WE WE TURN TO YOU TO SEE IF YOU HAVE MONEY. ARE CLOSING THOUGHTS I JUST SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL TO A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FRAWLEY WORK IN YOUR SUPPORT AND HELPING US THROUGH THIS. VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS WANT TO KEEP IT MOVING FOR F.
