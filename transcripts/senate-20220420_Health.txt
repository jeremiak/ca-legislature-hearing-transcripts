FOR INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT VIA THE TELECONFERENCE ORVIS THE PARTICIPANT TOLL FREE NUMBER AND ACCESS CODE IS POSTED ON OUR COMMITTEE WEBSITE.

I WILL MAINTAIN DECORUM DURING THE HEARING AS IS CUSTOMARY AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE DESTRUCTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR AFTER CONNECTIONS MUTED. WHERE HELD HOLDING OUR COMMITTEE HEARINGS HERE IN THE- STREET BUILDING AND I ASK ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO BE PRESENT IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED- SO WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND- BEGINNER- HEARING. WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THE WORST ORIGINALLY SEVENTEEN BILLS ON THE AGENDA HOWEVER WE ARE NOT HEARING- FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE FOURTEEN SIXTY FOUR BY MYSELF PAN AND I'LL FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN- SB TWELVE NINETY BY SARA ALLEN. WE ALSO HAVE THREE ITEMS ON OUR PROPOSED CONSENT CALENDAR THAT'S ITEM NUMBER TWO SB EIGHT FORTY TO PLAY CENTER DODD. AYE NUMBER TWELVE SB 1298% OR A CHILLED BOTTLE AND ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN SB FOURTEEN SIXTY TWO BY CENTER BRADFORD- GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT QUITE AT A QUORUM HERE YET- I ACTUALLY- AND THE FIRST ORIGINALLY THE FIRST ITEM WAS GOING TO BE SB FOURTEEN SIXTY FOUR- I WILL ALSO TAKE THIS PRIVILEGE- I TAKE THIS MOMENT TO ACTION TAKEN OFF THEIR STATEMENTS ABOUT THIS THE FOURTEENTH WHICH IS NOT GOING TO BE HEARD. IT TODAY'S HEARING AND WE'RE NOT TAKING TESTIMONY BUT I'LL BE MAKING OFF THEIR STATEMENT. SB FOURTEEN SIXTY FOUR IS ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS WORKING TOGETHER ON PUBLIC SAFETY. TO SAVE LIVES FROM HEALTH THREATS. BOTH PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN KEY IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. ALMOST A MILLION AMERICANS LOST THEIR LIVES IN FREEDOM BECAUSE A COVETED INTENDS THE MILLIONS MORE HAVE LOST HER FREEDOM DUE TO POST CODE INJURY. THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES DEFENDING THE FREEDOM OF A COMMUNITIES FROM DISEASE NEED OUR HELP TO PUSH BACK AGAINST EXTREMISTS WHO SEEK TO TAKE THESE FREEDOMS AWAY FROM US. SB FOURTEEN SIXTY FOUR. IS SUPPORTED BY OUR STATE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ASK FOR OUR HELP IS LEGISLATORS. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE A CHALLENGING JOB EVEN PRE PANDEMIC. THERE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS WHOSE WORK PROTECTS MORE LIVES THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER PROFESSION ALTHOUGH TWO OFTEN THAT WORK IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ARE APPOINTED BY COUNTY OR CITY EXECUTIVES BUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE FACTS AND THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE. THEIR DUTY IS TO BE ABOVE POLITICS AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON SCIENCE IN THE SERVICE OF THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC. EVEN AT THE RISK TO THEIR OWN JOBS AND CAREERS. UNFORTUNATELY HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS NATIONALLY HAVE LEFT HER JOB DURING THE PANDEMIC. MANY COURAGEOUSLY RESIGNING OR BEING FORCED OUT FOR TRULY SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER. IN DDITION EXTREMISTS HAVE ATTACKED PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS DOING THEIR DUTY. LARGE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DR NICOLE QUICK RESIGNED AFTER FALLS VITRIOLIC PERSONAL ATTACKS AGAINST HER INCLUDING DISCLOSING HER HOME ADDRESS WHICH WOULD THEN FOLLOWED BY ATTACKS AGAINST HER AND HER FAMILY AT HER HOME. SAN DIEGO FELT OFF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DR WILMA WOOTEN ALSO HAD HER HOME ADDRESS DISCLOSED. AND PROTESTERS HAVE HARASSED FAMILIES A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AFTER HOMES. NUMEROUS PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS PARTICULARLY WOMEN HAVE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS REQUIRED SECURITY BEEN WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WITH THEIR STAFFS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF KOBE INTERLOCKED ALITY EXPECTANCY UNITED STATES IS WRITTEN RISEN OVER 60% SINCE NINETEEN HUNDRED. MOST OF THAT% INCREASE WAS DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS NATION DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THIS PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS WERE BEING ATTACKED BY EXTREMIST. US LIFE EXPECTANCY FELL BY OVER TWO YEARS. IN CONTRAST BUT EXPECT TO SEE IN OTHER HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES LIKE OURS FELL BY ONLY POINT SIX PER YEARS IN THE FIRST YEAR TO PANDEMIC IN FACT INCREASED LAST YEAR. NOT SURPRISINGLY UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS COUNTRY IN TWENTY TWENTY LIFE EXPECTANCY DISPROPORTIONATELY FELL FOR BLACKS AND LATINOS. BUT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHITE PEOPLE HAD THE LARGEST LOSS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE UNITED STATES HEALTH HAS HAD SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO NOT IMMUNE FROM COVET. TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE DEADLIEST YEAR FOR ACTIVE DUTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN NEARLY A CENTURY AND COATED WITH LEASING LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH BECAUSE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT DEATHS BOTH IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ALMOST THREE TIMES AS MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KILLED BY COBIT AND FIREARMS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS LOSS OF LIFE AN INJURY AS WELL AS ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM COVE IT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE NOT RECEIVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO PROTECT US. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY HERE IN MY DISTRICT SACRAMENTO COUNTY SHERIFF DECLARED HIS DEPARTMENT REFUSED TO ENFORCE MASKING CURFEW ORDERS AT THE START THE PANDEMIC. IN A REPORT% RELEASED THIS MONTH SACRAMENTO COUNTY GRAND JURY FOUND THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE. OF PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF COVER NINETEEN WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HAMPERED. BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT REFUSAL OF THE TUNE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS DESPITE PLEASE FROM COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH THE PLEASE THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. THE GRAND JURY ALSO NOTED THAT THE COUNTY QUOTE ABANDONED A RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CODE SPENDING ON QUOTE AND QUOTE UNDERMINE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT. ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION AND CODEPEN DEMO FOR SPOTS FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WHILE THE STRUGGLING OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH RECEIVE MINIMAL FUNDING. UNFORTUNATELY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ALL TOO WELL SACRAMENTO COUNTY WAS NOT THE ONLY COUNTY WHERE THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED. ALTHOUGH SB FOURTEEN SIXTY FOUR IS NOT BEING HEARD TODAY I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE THE COURAGE AND SACRIFICE OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ND WORKERS OUR HEROES. TIMEA MY LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES WILL NOT GIVE UP AND HELPING YOU PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND STATE. I ASKED CALIFORNIANS RESPECT AND HONOR FRONTLINE PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS AND WORKERS THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO. OUR AGENDA AND I BELIEVE- SIR WIENER HERE HERE. AND SO- WHAT LOOKS A MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER THREE SB EIGHT FIFTY THREE. HERE TO PRESENT TWO THREE FOUR I WAS A WILL CONTINUE THE SUB COMMITTEE STUDENT OUT OF COURT YET. IF YOU ARE GO AHEAD PERCENT ITEM NUMBER THREE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN IF I MAY- DEVIOUS AS WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADER- INTO. TO TAKE A SCIENCE SPACE APPROACH APPROACH- AND PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS EVEN IN THE FACE OF SIGNIFICANCE- MISINFORMATION AND AT TIMES SOCIOPATHIC BEHAVIOR SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- SO COLLEAGUES- ON THE START BUTTON RIGHT BECAUSE ANY SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY THREE- THE MEDICATION ACCESS- ACT WHICH WILL HELP ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE NOT HUNG OUT TO DRY- WHEN PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION COVERAGE IS DENIED- THE BILL ONE SURE THAT WALL. AND APPEAL IS BEING REVIEWED FOR THE NILE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS PATIENTS CAN ACCESS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEDICINE AND AVOID A LAPSE IN TREATMENT I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF- FOR ITS WORK IN THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- TO CLARIFY THAT AND ROWLEY'S WILL STILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COST SHARING- AND- FIND. IN REVIEW DECISION ONE THE MATTER INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW AND I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE PARENTS TO ADDRESS- THERE- THE ISSUE. RAISED COLLEAGUES AS YOU KNOW MANY CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC ILLNESS RELY ON PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS LIVE TIONAL FIVE EVEN SERVICE. SOME CHRONIC ILLNESSES- LIKE INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE I HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF TREATMENTS. AVAILABLE SENATOR EIGHT FIFTY- DOES TO. FIRST THE BILL REQUIRE- INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COVER A DRUG- DOES HER DOSAGE FORM THAT'S BEEN PREVIOUSLY PRESCRIBED TO A PATIENT THROUGH THE DURATION OF AN APPEALS PROCESS- AND THEN PROHIBITS PLANS FROM SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT IF THE DENIAL- IS UP HELD- THE PERSON IS ALREADY TAKING MEDICATION- AND I HEALTH PLAN TRIES TO- SWITCH THE PERSON OR THAN EYES. A CHANGE IN DOSAGE OR DOSAGE FORM FOR THE SAME MEDICATION- IF THE PERSON APPEALS- THEY HAVE TO GROUP PLAN WILL HAVE TO COVER DURING THE NEW TOWCESTER DOSAGE FORM DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE APPEAL. TO SOMEONE'S NOT GOING ON AND OFF AND ON AND OFF- AND THEN IF THE APPEALS SUSTAIN THE CHEMICAL BACK AND RECOUP SO IT'S ASKING THE PLANS TO SIMPLY KEEP COVERING IT WHAT. WAS BEING WORKED OUT SECONDLY THE BILL STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA'S PROHIBITION ON NON MEDICAL SWITCHING- WHICH IS WHAT A HEALTH PLAN FORCES A PATIENT TO SWITCH FROM A PRESCRIBED DRUGS TO DIFFERENT DRUGS FOR NON MEDICAL REASONS- AND THE- CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS PROTECTIONS AGAINST NON MEDICAL SUITE- SB FIFTY THREE B. WILL- CLARIFY AND EXPAND. THE SCOPE OF THE NON MEDICAL SWITCHING PROHIBITION TO INCLUDE THE PRESCRIBED DOSE SEARCH FORM- SO A- HEALTH PLAN COULD NOT FORCE YOU TO USE A DIFFERENT DOSE OR A FORM OF DOSING- THAT YOUR DOCTOR HAS NOT RECOMMENDED- SO IT IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE. AIDS PATIENTS IN YOU TO HAVE THIS- HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS- PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH SERIOUS CRIME FICTION. SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THEM AT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EYEBROW- AND TESTED TODAY- FOR ANNIKA BLANCATO. AND DOCTORS SAID THE BOSS- AND- FOR TECHNICAL.

MY NAME IS VERONICA BLANCATO AND I HAVE LIVED WITH CROHN'S DISEASE FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS MORE THAN HALF OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I A COLLAPSED AT WORK AND WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH AN ABSCESS THE SIZE OF A GRAPEFRUIT IN MY ACCIDENT. ONE OF THE MANY COMMON COMPLICATIONS OF CROHN'S DISEASE MEDICATIONS FROM REMICADE HUMIRA BOTH DRUGS WHICH FALL UNDER THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL BEING PRESENTED TODAY. I TAKING HUMIRA FOR ALMOST SEVEN YEARS NOW IT HAS SINGLE HANDEDLY SAVED MY LIFE. BUT IT TOOK ALMOST EIGHT MONTHS TO GET THAT PRESCRIPTION APPROVED BECAUSE THE DOES PRESCRIBE TO ME WITH CONSIDERED OFF LABEL AND THE ASSOCIATED APPEAL PROCESS WAS A GARGANTUAN FEAT. IN THAT EIGHT MONTH TIME PERIOD THAT I SPENT MOSTLY UN MEDICAID IT MIGHT INSTANCE RETURNED WITH A VENGEANCE AND I WAS FORCED TO UNDERGO SURGERY THE SECOND ONE I WOULD HAVE THUS FAR. I'LL NEVER KNOW IF HAVING ACCESS TO HEAR SOONER COULD HAVE SPARED ME AT SECOND SURGERY. LIKE I MENTIONED HUMIRA SAVED MY LIFE AND IT TOOK MANY VARIATIONS OF COAXES AND FREQUENCIES FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. ALL OF THEM CONSIDERED OFF LABEL AND NEARLY ALL OF THEM REQUIRING A LENGTHY PRIOR AUTHORIZATION APPROVAL AN APPEAL PROCESS. WHICH GAVE MY DISEASE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD ME HOSTAGE ONCE AGAIN. THIS BILL CAN PREVENT MY EXPERIENCE FROM BEING THE STATUS QUO AND CAN ALLOW THESE LIFE CHANGING MEDICINES TO DO WHAT THEY ARE INTENDED TO DO YOU SHOULD SAVE LIVES LIKE MINE. I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE ON TO DR SABIHA ABBAS HE- RICHARD CARING MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

THIS DISEASE IS A CHRONIC LIFELONG ILLNESS THAT CAN LEAD TO SYMPTOMS INCLUDING SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN NOW NUTRITION WEIGHT LOSS AND CAN ALSO PROGRESS TO CANCER OF THE INTESTINES. PRODUCTS BECAUSE ONE NAY SAMPLE OF THIS UNRELENTING NATURE OF THIS DISEASE. WE MANAGE THESE SYMPTOMS AND THIS DISEASE BY USING MEDICATIONS THAT MODULATE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND IN RECENT YEARS HAVE LEARNED THE CONSEQUENCES WHEN PATIENTS DO NOT RECEIVE THEIR MEDICATIONS ON TIME AND AT THE RIGHT DOSE. I HAVE WITNESSED MY PATIENTS DEVELOPED DISEASE PROGRESSION AND A PLAYER IN THEIR SYMPTOMS WHEN THEIR MEDICATION IS DELAYED DURING INSURANCE PRE AUTHORIZATION OR APPEAL PROCESS. YUBA PATIENTS HAVE HAD TO BRIDGE THE TIME GAP WITH OTHER IMMUNO SUPPRESSIVE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE USED ON A TEMPORARY BASIS SUCH AS CORTICOSTEROIDS. WE HAVE THEIR OWN SIDE EFFECTS THE CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING RASHES AND INCREASED RISK OF INFECTION. OTHER PATIENTS DEVELOPED AND- TO THEIR ORIGINAL MEDICATION WHICH US HAVING TO SWITCH THEM TO A NEW MEDICATION WHICH MAY NOT CONTROL THE DISEASE PROCESS AND ONLY FURTHER PROLONG THEIR ACTIVE SYMPTOMS. NINE FREQUENTLY SOME PATIENTS HAVE HAD TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR BE HOSPITALIZED NOT ONLY TO RECEIVE IV MEDICATIONS TO CONTROL THE CROWD CONTROL THEIR DISEASE AND MAY ALSO RESULT IN SURGERY. AT FRONT. THIS TESTIFIED. IF BONDS WITH ALL THESE- PAGES ONE DISEASE CONDITION WHERE PATIENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL. BUT THE ON TIME DOSING OF MEDICATIONS IS CRITICAL ACROSS MULTIPLE MEDICAL SPECIALTIES TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES INCLUDING RHEUMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY AND HEMATOLOGY.

A LOOK AT GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN OR THE COMMITTEE HAD JEFF HAMPTON OF CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS. I REGRETTABLY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION SPD FIFTY THREE I WHICH REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS TO COVER TONIGHT MEDICATION OR DOSAGE OF A MEDICATION DURING- AN APPEALS PROCESS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AND THE IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE- CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ON THE BILL DATE- HOWEVER IT HEALTH MENTAL I UPON SEVERAL CRITICAL UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE THAT. PAID RECEIVE THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME. THE RIGHT PROVIDER. THESE PARTICLES ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN PROMOTING SAFE EFFECTIVE AND AFFORDABLE CARE FOR PLAN. RELEASED RIGHT STATION STEP THERAPY. ARE PRO- THE ARE PARTICULARLY IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG- CONCERT. THE FOR. AND ADDICTION AS WELL AS FOR THE HIGH COST OF THESE DRUGS. UNFORTUNATELY SB THIRTY THREE WOULD PROBABLY DISMANTLE EXISTING UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROCESSES FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. SB FIFTY THREE EFFECTIVELY NEGATES OUR ABILITY TO ENSURE CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE USE. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND MAY ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF EXPENSIVE SPECIALTY. AND BRAND NAME DRUGS ONE ENGINEER LOWER COST BRAND CLEVELAND. IS AVAILABLE IN CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. ADDITIONALLY WE BELIEVE SB FIVE THREE COULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT PATIENT SAFETY CONCERNS FOR OUR RELEASE. I WANT HEALTH PLAN TO THIS TO LIMIT OR A DRUG OR SPECIFIC DOSES OF A DRUG I GENERALLY FOR SAFETY REASONS. A SPECIFIC REASONS INCLUDE POTENTIAL ABUSE OR OVER USE. AND CONSISTENT USE WITH FDA APPROVED LABELING. OR PREVENT USES AT DOSES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED OR SHOWN TO BE EFFICACIOUS. SB FIFTY THREE DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE SAFETY CONCERNS AND ALLOWS ENROLLEES UNFETTERED ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DURING THE APPEALS PROCESS THAT ANY HEALTH PLAN OVERSIGHT. I ARE STRONGLY CONCERNED THE STRIPPING HEALTH PLANS OF THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CLINICAL OVERSIGHT AND ACCESS TO CERTAIN DRUGS. MAY CAUSE POTENTIALLY ADVERSE REACTIONS IN REAL HARM TO OUR RELEASE. LASTLY WE LEAVE SB FIFTY THREE WILL LEAD TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE COSTS AND HEALTHCARE DELIVERY. THE INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM ANALYSIS OF SB FIFTY THREE. CITED THE PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING WILL LIKELY INCREASE BY NEARLY EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR ENROLLEES. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA'S RIGHTLY FOCUSED ON ACHIEVING ABOUT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND COST CONTAINMENT WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. TWO MINUTES AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL WILL LEAD TO HIGHER PREMIUMS AND HARMING. CURRENT AFFORDABILITY EFFORTS TO FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE BUT I LOOK FOURTEEN WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU- WELL BRING ON- KRISTEN YOUNG FROM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND FORTY NINE SECONDS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESS UNION FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB FIFTY THREE. THE BILL IS OBVIOUSLY WELL INTENTIONED I'VE YET TO COME ACROSS THAT THE HEALTH BILL THAT ISN'T- UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WITH SB FIFTY THREE THE PRIMARY CONCERN THAT WE HAVE THIS BILL OR THE COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE- CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS- REVIEW PROGRAM CONDUCTED AN ANALYSIS IN THE DETERMINE THAT EMPLOYER PREMIUMS WOULD RISE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AT THE BILL WENT INTO EFFECT. EMPLOYEE PREMIUMS WOULD INCREASE OVER NINE MILLION DOLLARS UNDER SB FIFTY THREE SO WHILE THE INCREASE ALONE MAY SEEM TOLERABLE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN CONTEXT NUMEROUS BENEFIT MANDATES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AND COLLECTIVELY THE INCREASE PREMIUMS AND HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE AVERAGE FAMILY HEALTH PLAN PREMIUM FOR JOB BASED COVERAGE HAS INCREASED TWENTY TWO PERCENT. OR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFITS SURVEY INDICATED THAT FOR JOB BASED COVERAGE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PREMIUM FOR FAMILY COVERAGE IS 220-002-0020 ONE DOLLARS THAT WAS A 4% COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR.

AND AGAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT FIFTY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. MR THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN OUR QUEUE RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO ME AS A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THURMOND IS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- WHAT I'M READING IT SAYS REQUIRES HEALTH PLAN CONTRACT- THAT COVERS PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR A DRUG- OR DOSE OF A DRUG. DURING UTILIZATION REVIEW ANDANY APPEALS THAT THAT DRUG IS BEEN PREVIOUSLY PRE APPROVED FOR MEDICAL CONDITIONS SO. ONLY DURING UTILIZATION REVIEW AND ANY APPEAL THAT MAY BE TAKING PLACE BUT IF FOR INSTANCE. THE PEEL UNITS THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THEY SAY NO THIS IS JUST NOT RIGHT VIEW THEN IT DOESN'T APPLY IS THAT RIGHT RIGHT IF YOU IF YOU LOSE YOUR APPEAL THEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO COVERAGE. BY DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE APPEAL WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT STABILITY AND THEN THEY CAN GO BACK AFTERWARDS AND SAID FOR THOSE TWO MONTHS YOU HAVE TO KNOW PASSED BACK OKAY I JUST. REALIZED OKAY SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR- JED HAMPTON WOULD YOU MIND COMING MISTER CHARITY. OKAY IF YOU IN MY ANTHONY PLEASE COME LIKE A PHONE I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED- CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE PERHAPS- YOU KNOW ABUSING THE PRESCRIPTIONS THAT THEY MAY BE PRESCRIBED BY THEIR DOCTOR AND I JUST WONDER WHAT TYPES OF DRUGS WERE YOU REFERRING TO THE ARE YOU THINKING OPIOIDS OR BECAUSE- DURING THE COURSE OF THIS CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DISEASES LIKE CROHN'S AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES THAT. I'M CERTAINLY NO ONE IS- YOU KNOW TAKING DEAD. TO GET HIGH EITHER TAKING IT BECAUSE OF THE ILLNESS AT THE HOUSE I'M JUST IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND ANSWERING THAT QUESTION YET NOT NOT NO PROBLEM THANK THANK YOU AND MAKE SURE- YES- SO. WITH THE BILL THOUGH ISN'T IN RIGHT NOW IT IT DOESN'T LIMIT- WHICH DRUGS- YOU KNOW OR APPLICABLE TO THE BILL SO WHAT WHILE. THERE ARE SOME DRUGS EXCELLENT YOU KNOW FOR CRUNCHING OR COLITIS BASED DRUGS ON THIS THIS BILL DOES NOT SPECIFY WHICH DRUGS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS NEW YEAR REQUIREMENT OR LACK OF UTILIZATION REVIEW. OR UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT SO I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS IS THAT THE WAY THAT WE READ THE BILL IS THAT THAT THIS CAN BE OPEN TO IT TO ESSENTIALLY ANY AND ALL DRUGS ARE PRESCRIBED. BY DOCTORS TODAY BUT SO ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT THIS YOU HAVE A CONCERN WITH SAY OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE WHAT IS YOUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS. YEAH I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT COULD BE A CONCERN I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING WHEN WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BILL WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT THE BILL SENATE THERE IS NO- ABILITY TO LIMIT THE DOSAGE OF THE DRUG IN PARTICULAR. AND THE FACT THAT THE BILL DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY LIMIT WHICH DRUGS ARE OR NOT APPLICABLE TO THE BILL- WE SEE THAT AS BEING KIND OF WIDE OPEN SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE OPIOIDS WHICH COULD. POTENTIALLY BE AN ISSUE THAT THAT WERE PRESCRIBED- IT COULD BE OTHER DRUGS- IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO A CLINICAL RADIO AND LOOK AT THE CLINICAL PROPRIOCEPTIVE DOSAGE OF THE DRUG IN PARTICULAR- YOU KNOW WE FEEL THAT THAT. PATIENT SAFETY CONCERNS COULD ARISE FROM FROM THAT OKAY SO. THEN ON THAT NOTE- YOU KNOW THEY- A REAL. BETWEEN PATIENT AND THE DOCTOR AND THE PATIENT. IN THE ENSURING THE DOCTOR BY. UNITY DO YOU THINK THAT THE DOCTOR. MIGHT HAVE- A BETTER INDICATION OF WHAT'S BEST FOR HIS REPORT HER PATIENT MORE SO THAN SAY AN INSURANCE PLAN WOULD. YEAH I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING YOU KNOW PROVIDERS PLANS- INDIVIDUAL WORK TOGETHER- AND IN THAT SCENARIO TO ENSURE YOU KNOW- COMING UP CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT ALL RIGHT WE CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS WE CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND TRUST AND WORK THESE PROVIDERS ON ON ON A- CLOSELY RELATED BASIS. YOU KNOW I THINK OUR GENERAL CONCERN IS RUNNING AROUND THE UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS THAT WE TYPICALLY USE THAT ARE IN PLACE CURRENTLY- YOU KNOW WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THAT THIS BILL WOULD DISMANTLE THAT PROCESS A CENTRALLY AND SO WE WOULD HAVE NO ABILITY AS- YOU KNOW. ACTING IN OVERSIGHT POSITION TO LOOK FOR REVIEW ANY OF THE CLINICAL COMPLETE APPROPRIATE. POTENTIAL USES ARE TREATMENTS FOR THESE DRUGS SO THAT'S GENERALLY AROUND THAT PROCESS WHERE WE ARE CONCERNED WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS PROVIDERS YOU KNOW BUT THE NETWORKING CONTRACTED PROVIDERS ARE OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM- BUT I THINK THESE PROCESSES- YOU KNOW ARE IN PLACE FOR A REASON- AND THAT'S GENERALLY WHITE WE HAVE- OKAY SIR THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT- I. THE THIS IS ALWAYS A TOUGH ISSUE YOU KNOW BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY COSTS ARE A CONCERN AND IF COSTS ARE GOING TO INCREASE FOR THE OTHER- AB PLAN HOLDERS THEN YOU KNOW THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE. BUT THEN WE HAVE TO GO TO THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION WHICH IS WHAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING A PEOPLE HAVING A CHRONIC ILLNESS FOR WHICH THEY NEED IN THEIR PARTICULAR PRESCRIPTION AND THEN RUNNING INTO ISSUES WITH THEIR INSURANCE PLAN SAYING WE DON'T NEED THAT ANYMORE AND WHILE I CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE AND RESPECT THE CONCERN THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW SOME OPIOID ADDICTION MIGHT BE COMING INTO PLAY HERE WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS I JUST. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE EMPHASIS OF THE BILL AND I THINK IT'S- IT'S TERRIBLY. CRUEL TO TELL SOMEONE THAT THE MEDICINE THAT HAS BEEN WORKING FOR YOU- AND THAT YOU HAVE DISCUSSED WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN IN YOUR POSITION IS MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT THIS IS THE BEST THING FOR YOU BUT THEN AN INSURANCE PLAN STEPS IN AND SAYS WELL WE DON'T THINK SO WHEN THEY'VE NOT GONE TO MEDICAL SCHOOL ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE COLLECTED THE DATA. AND I DO HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THE WORK THAT GOES INTO THAT BUT THE REALITY IS THE PHYSICIAN IS KNOWS THEIR PATIENT IS SAT WITH THEM IN THE ROOM AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND I THINK THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL- SO THANK YOU FOR ASKING MY QUESTIONS. ARE ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS EXCUSE ME THINK CENTER WIENER. ASSEMBLY ROW. THANK YOU THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN LINE WITH WHAT. MISS MELINDA'S ARE GASSED- BRIGUS I SHOULD SAY MY COLLEAGUE FROM HAS CAN DO- SO THIS BILL OF THE WAY I READ IT AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IS DIFFERENT IT'S- CURRENTLY. INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY ON MEDICATION. M. FOR ANY TYPE OF SPECIFIC DISEASE. AND THEN SOMETHING COMES UP AND THERE'S A REVIEW AND- YOU JUST WANT TO BE ABLE THIS BILL WANTS TO BE ABLE TO JUST ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THE MEDICATION THEY'VE BEEN ON. DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS. TWO CAN. THE MEDICATION OR IF THE DOCTOR DETERMINES THAT A DIFFERENT DOSAGE OR DOSAGE FORM. IS REQUIRED LIKE IF THEY WERE- IF IT IF IT DOESN'T MAKE UP MEDICAID AND THAT THERE. HAVE TO USE VIA A PATCH AND THEN IT COMES OUT. AS AN INJECTABLE AND THE DOCTOR DETERMINES THAT THE INJECTABLE IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. THAN THE PATCH FROM THE DOG BEN IS SWITCHING BUT IT'S THE SAME DRUG- OR LET ME. GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE I WAS GOING TO DO THIS TODAY- BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO PERSONALIZE THESE THINGS BUT I MAKE AN EXCEPTION. BECAUSE OF VERONICA BLANCATO COULD TELL HER STORY AND SO CAN I. UNLIKE VERONICA. MILES CRISIS I'VE HAD IT FOR THIRTY THREE. YEARS AND- HI YOU MAY RECALL LAST JULY COLLEAGUES THAT I MISSED A HEALTH COMMITTEE. HEARING AND THEN- CENTER EGGMAN WAS KIND OF TO SIT IN FOR ME AND HOUSING COMMITTEE- I WAS OUT FOR A WEEK BECAUSE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL- BECAUSE- UNLIKE VERONICA- ONE EVENING- I. EXPERIENCE THE MOST INTENSE OF DOMINO PAIN THAT I COULD EVEN IMAGINE- AND I WAS ABLE TO CRAWL UP THE STAIRS AND GET MY LANDLORD TO. DRIVE ME TO THE HOSPITAL THANK YOU SUTTER FOR DOING A GREAT JOB CARING FOR ME- AND IT WAS BECAUSE I. MIGHT BE HAVE DEVELOPED ANTIBODIES TO MY BIOLOGIC AND SO I HAVE NO MEDICINE MY SYSTEM AND I HAD ABSCESSES LIKE VERONICA DID AND SO I CAN TEST EVERYTHING. THAT SHE SAID. AND SO MY DOCTOR SWITCHED ME TO A NEW BIOLOGICALS LARA- AND THANKFULLY AND THANK YOU TO ANTHEM ANTHEM QUICKLY APPROVED AND THERE WERE NO ISSUES- AND I TAKE IT. IT'S INJECTABLE BY TAKE EVERY EIGHT WEEKS AND IT'S WORKED BEAUTIFULLY FOR ME IT'S REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB. BUT FOR A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE. LARA EIGHT WEEKS MIGHT BE TOO INFREQUENT AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT EVERY FOUR WEEKS OR EVERY SIX WEEKS AND YOUR DOCTOR MAKES THAT DECISION- AND YOU HAVE TO GET PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. FROM THE HEALTH PLAN. TO DO THAT- AND SO IF I WERE TO NEED. AT SOME POINT. AND THEY DENIED IT. THAT I WOULD HAVE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE UP TO MY DOC TO YOU KNOW IT WOULD IS NOT. YOU NEED IT SIX WEEKS OR FIVE WEEKS OR FOUR WEEKS INSIDE A HEALTH PLAN AND I AND I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS CENTER MELINDA'S. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS ABOUT AND IF I HAD TO APPEAL- I COULD GET THEM TO HAVE THAT PROPER DOSAGES DURING THE APPEAL. SO THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO MISS MORE HEALTH COMMITTEE MEETINGS SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE BILL IS ABOUT. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU CAN ASK MISTER HAMPTON TO COME FORWARD AGAIN I APOLOGIZE JUST TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS. THE BASED ON WHAT THE AUTHOR JUST SAID AND THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S IS IT IT'S A CURRENT. MEDICATION PRESCRIBED ALREADY APPROVED BY. THE PLANS AND THEN THE DOCTOR MAKES EITHER AN ADJUSTMENT OR SWITCHING THE MEDICATION. I'M IT YOUR CONCERN- YOU SAID ACTUALLY YOU SAID- YOU'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST AND ADDICTION WHAT'S WHAT'S THE APPEAL PROCESS TIMELINE THE THIRTY DAYS NINETY DAYS HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS YEAH IT'S YOURS. IT'S DIED GENERAL GENERALLY THIRTY DAYS THIRTY DAYS ON SCIENCE TRIED TO OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW- DUE PROCESS THESE THESE APPEALS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- BUT YET THAT'S GENERALLY THE CASE. AND I KNOW IT WAS THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE CHAMBER HE MADE THE COST ESTIMATES I BELIEVE- 22% INCREASE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS NINE MILLION DOLLARS COST INCREASE. I MEAN NEED RATTLED OFF A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND I'M SURE IT'S IN THE ANALYSIS. AND HOW MANY OF THESE. UTILIZATION REVIEWS FOR MEDICATION THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING IN A PATIENT YOU GUYS DO AN ESTIMATED BASIS. YOU KNOW CENTER I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO GO BACK TO MY FOLKS YOU KNOW TO GET MORE ACCURATE ANSWER FOR YOU ON HOW AND HOW OFTEN THE INTERVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED I MEAN THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT THAT THEY'RE DONE. YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT REGULARLY BUT UP FOR ME ON A SPECIFIC NUMBER I WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO FOLLOW BACK UP WITH YOU AND WHEN YOU DO THEM SOMEWHAT REGULARLY AND THANK YOU FOR THE FOLLOW UP I'D APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION WHEN YOU DO THEM SOMEWHAT REGULARLY DO YOU STOPPED. THE MEDICATION REQUESTS FROM THE PROVIDE THE MEDICAL PROVIDER AT THAT TIME CURRENTLY. BUT SO I'M SORRY IT JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION CREEK I JUST WELL I WAS ONE MAKE SURE- SO IF YOU'RE AT IF YOU'RE ASKING IF. IT'S IN ROWLEY- IS SEEKING TO HAVE A CHANGE OF OTHER DRUG OR DOSAGE OF THE DRUG- ARE YOU ASKING THAT YOU KNOW WHETHER WE STOP THAT UPON I'M ASKING IF YOU IF SAID OKAY SO LET ME REPHRASE THAT QUESTION. IF A MEDICAL PROVIDER SEND YOUR PRESCRIPTION THAT I'M CURRENTLY ON IN MY MEDICAL PROVIDER SAYS YOU NEED TO UPGRADE THIS TO FOUR WEEKS INSTEAD OF EIGHT WEEKS LIKE THE AUTHOR WAS SEEN. DO YOU CAN DO YOU PROVIDE ME THE FOUR WEEKS AT YOUR DISCRETION I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE AUTHOR SAID HE GOT THE CHANGE INSTANTLY. I'M I'M I'M HOPING IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE SENATOR SCOTT WIENER- BUT IF THERE'S A AVERAGE EVERYDAY CITIZEN THAT SAYS YOU KNOW THE DOCTOR SAYS I HAVE TO HAVE THIS. INJECTABLE NOW BECAUSE IT'S STILL NOT AFFECTING ME AM I WOULD THINK THAT YOU GUYS WOULD BE JUST AS EXPEDIENT IN APPROVING. THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS REQUEST IS THAT TRUE YES YES GENERALLY SPEAKING AFTER THE AMONG THESE OBVIOUSLY WITH WHEN IT COMES TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SPECIALLY IF IT'S THERE I'M TREATING YOU KNOW CHRONIC. RESEARCH CONDITIONS- HEALTH CENTER ARE YOU KNOW WE PROCESS THOSE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. I GET PERSONAL STORIES LIKE HIS AND AGAIN LATER THAT LADY THAT TESTIFIED. AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS DELAY FOR A LENGTHY PROCESS YOU GUYS IMMEDIATELY EXPECT THIS YES GEN MOST CASES GENERALLY SPEAKING GENERALLY SPEAKING YES OKAY. SO IF YOU DO THAT I'M KIND OF CURIOUS AND AGAIN I'M JUST GONNA MAKE THE STATEMENT OF A YES ANSWER IT IF YOU HAVE UTILIZATION REVIEW ALREADY AVAILABLE YOU DO IT AN EXPEDITED PROCESS- I DON'T SEE WHERE THE COST FACTOR COMES IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE TAKING A WHOLE LIKE EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE REQUESTING AND THAT CHANGING MEDICATION- EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE REQUESTING THE MOST EXPENSIVE MEDICATION BUT IT'S TRULY NOT THOUGH IT'S JUST WHAT THE MEDICAL PROVIDER PROVIDES WRITE THAT PRESCRIPTION YEAH I THINK IN TERMS OF THE COST ESTIMATES CENTER I THINK- YOU KNOW YOU THE NUMBERS WE WERE CITING OR FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM. AND THEIR ESTIMATES WERE BASED ON GREATER UTILIZATION OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AS WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL OFF TED TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF SPECIALTY DRUGS- AND IN THE IN THE TRUCKS ARE OBVIOUSLY TYPICALLY- COST QUITE A BIT MORE- THAN CONVENING STANDARD MEDICATION- ANYONE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE SO- YOU KNOW FROM FROM I THINK FROM THE CHAMBERS PERSPECTIVE IN IT THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE LOOKING AT THAT THE RISING COSTS IS GREATER UTILIZATION AND POTENTIALLY GREATER USE A SPECIALTY DRUGS FOR BRAND NAME DRUGS- IT IN IN LIEU OF USING- ENGINEERING OR LOWER COSTS ARE LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE BUT IT'S ONLY FOR THAT TIME PERIOD FROM ZERO TO THIRTY DAYS FOR THE REVIEW RIGHT. OR NOT YOU CAN DENY IT YEAH I GUESS GENERALLY SPEAKING SO DURING THE APPEAL PROCESS LIKE AS ONCE IT'S ONCE IT'S TONIGHT IT'S JUST DONE SO IF YOU'VE DENIED IN FIVE DAYS. ANY OTHER WEEK YOU KNOW. IT COULD BE DENIED AND DAYS DAYS WHEN. SEVEN THIRTY IS THE- OR THIRTY DAYS A MAC. YES YEAH JERRY WE HAVE TO GENTLY PRUDENT AND WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS SIR. I'M CERTAIN THE LETTUCE I JUST WANTED AND- JUST. GOING BACK TO THE OPIOID- ISSUE WHAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WAS THE CARE SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY. OUR DATABASE IS ALREADY IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WOULD ADDRESS YOU KNOW IF THERE IS OVER PRESCRIBING OF OPIOIDS THAT WE KIND OF ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THAT. SO THANK YOU. EXECUTIVES AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. ABUSE OF DRUGS AND I THINK YOU WERE SPOT ON CENTER MELENDEZ SAID- THAT. IF YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN SEVEN OPP OPIOIDS. LIKE THE THIRD COST IS NOT THE ISSUE BUT AS WE KNOW WITH OPIOIDS ARE THOSE ARE TYPICALLY NOT I'M SURE THERE'S SOME SPECIALIZED KIND OF OPENS THE GENERALLY THOSE ARE OFTEN GENERIC AND THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY EXPENSIVE THAT'S NOT WHAT THE FIGHT OF IS ABOUT. AND IT IS OFTEN ABOUT THE BIOLOGICS AND THE FACT THAT THEY THEY DO DENY- COVERED FOR BIOLOGICS AT TIMES- AND NOT OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T BE FIGHTING. THIS BILL RIGHT THERE WHEN THEY WON RESERVE THE RIGHT THAT EVEN IF YOUR DOCTOR SAYS. THAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT DOES OR YOU NEED TO HAVE INTRACTABLE INSTEAD OF A PILL- THEY WANT TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO JUST BE ABLE TO REJECT THAT- AND THIS BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS THANK YOU. SIR EDMUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP IN YOU CENTER WE DON'T THINK FOR SHARING WITH THE I NOTICED A- ALWAYS EASY BUT THINK APPRECIATE THAT- AND APPRECIATE ALSO. WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS. NOT NOTHING YOUR FRAGILE BUT WITH VERY FRAGILE HEALTH CARE AND A LOT OF HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND A LOT OF INTERACTIONS WITH THE- PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACIES AND- HEALTH PLANS I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS. LESS EXPENSIVE TO RATION HEALTHCARE. ARE THAT'S JUST THE BASIC THE MORE YOU RUSSIAN HEALTH CARE THE LESS EXPENSIVE IT IS. AND WHAT INSURANCE ARE PAYING FOR IT THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE MARKING A NINE IT COMES. BACK TO ALL OF US OF COURSE- BUT I REALLY THINK WHEN WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS LIKE THIS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HEARD THE OPPOSITION SAY WAS- IT. IT DISRUPTS THE- STANDARD UTILIZATION PROCESS- BUT- WE'VE BEEN DOING UTILIZATION REVIEW SINCE. THE BEGINNING OF TIME. WELL NOT BEGINNING BUT- THE LAST. THE LAST COUPLE DECADES IN HEALTH CARE. MAYBE IT'S TIME TO CHANGE OF THOSE PROCESSES RIGHT WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN DO THAT IF THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S ON SOMETHING. LIKE THIS THAT'S THAT'S- VERY PRECISE AND NEW IN A BIOLOGIC. MAYBE THAT UTILIZATION REVIEW. COULD BE FASTER. THERE'S DIFFERENT THINGS WE CAN DO. THEN RUSSIAN HEALTH CARE WHICH OFTEN ENDS UP IN IN MORE SEVERE COST WHEN SOMEONE ENDS UP IN THE HOSPITAL. AS YOU SHARED YOUR DEBT. SO I THINK IS A GOOD BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND INTEREST AND WE TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN. OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND DUBBED THEM THE OF THE FANTASTIC SCIENCE AND DRUGS THAT WE HAVE. TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES TO EXPAND PEOPLE'S LIVES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY. OF PEOPLE'S LIVES- AND IT SHOULD HAVE EVERY ACCESS TO THE THAT THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND IT SHOULD BE THE INSURANCES HAS NOW. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL. THOSE MOVE A CENTER EGGMAN ANY QUESTIONS ARE COMMON FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SECOND OKAY SEEING NONE- SIR WIENER FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING BY STAFF AND THAT TAKING THE AMENDMENTS- PROPOSED. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD HERE I THINK IT REALLY ILLUSTRATES THE PORTENTS OF FILE- PATIENTS NEED TO SPELL AND- CERTAINLY YOU KNOW TIMES- RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION- BUT- FUNDAMENTALLY THESE ARE ABOUT. DRUGS THAT. PATIENTS NOW I NEED THE RADION SO THEY WENT THROUGH SOME PROCESS BY WHICH SIMPLE PLAN HAS YES THERE'S SOME CHANGES- AND I THINK IS- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- CENTRO POINTED OUT THAT. YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU KEEP THE VIEW SHORT AND IT'S A FAIRLY STANDARD THAT WILL MINIMIZE THE COST TO SELL AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENTS. IN TERMS OF- MAKING A DECISION- AND- SO WITH THAT- CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING THE BILL OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. BECAUSE I REALLY. THE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION- TODAY AND I THINK A LOT OF YOU CLOSE FOR ME SO. ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. OKAY THANK YOU- SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS INSECT MY CENTER EGGMAN CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SB EIGHT FIFTY THREE. PM HI CAN I AM A LINDA'S BELINDA'S AYE EGGMAN EGGMAN AYE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ BY GROWTH GROUP BY HER TADO. LEYVA LIMON. LIMON I ROTH ALL RIGHT ROTH AYE RUBIO. WIENER FIVE WIENER AYE. FIFTY S. SO THAT BILLS CURRENTLY HAS EIGHT VOTES IT'S EIGHT ZERO- WILL HOLD THE BILL OPENED- TO OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOR SB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT BY SARAH WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES- THIS WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK- IN RECENT YEARS BUT OVER DECADES- TO MAKE SURE THAT- ARE HEALTH PLANS. ARE ACTUALLY COVERING THE HEALTH CARE WE NEED WHETHER ITS BIOLOGIC DRUGS WHETHER IT IS MENTAL HEALTH CARE THAT'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK WE'VE DONE. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING COVERAGE WHEN THEY- PURCHASE- HEALTH INSURANCE. PLANS SB EIGHT FIVE EIGHT IS THE NEXT UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY ENFORCING. THOSE LAWS. AND THAT WHEN A HEALTH PLAN- VIOLATES THE LAW PARTICULARLY IN A PERSISTENT SYSTEMATIC WAY. THAT THE FINES IMPOSED ARE NOT VIEWED AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. BUT THE FINES ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING AND CREATE A DETERRENT BECAUSE WHEN A PATIENT IS TONIGHT CARE- EVEN IF THEY'RE ALTERNATELY JANET. MONTHS OR YEARS LATER WHEN THE INSURANCE PLAN IS FOUNDED IN A BALL THAT DOESN'T HELP THEM FOR ALL THE TIME THEY'VE HAD TO WAIT WE WANT TO GET IT UP FRONT WHERE THE HELL TIMES DO THE RIGHT THING AND FOLLOW THE LAW AND TO BE CLEAR THIS IS ABOUT. TIMES WHEN HEALTH PLANS VIOLATE THE LAW NOT WHEN THEY'RE ARGUABLY BILINGUAL BUT WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE STATE TO HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW BY DENYING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO SOMEONE WHO IS ENTITLED. TO THAT COVERAGE- WE KNOW THAT ALL TOO OFTEN THE FINES ARE VERY LOW. THERE WAS A RECENT- VERY LARGE FINE- ANNOUNCED AGAINST LA CARE WHICH WAS LA COUNTY'S PUBLICLY ON HEALTH PLAN THAT INSURANCE TWO MILLION MEDIC HELP PATIENTS- THIS WAS THE LARGEST PENALTY IN STATE HISTORY AND SO MADE HEADLINES IS A BIG DEAL- AND YET. THE PER VIOLATION IT WAS A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS IT'D BEEN THAT SYSTEMATIC AND PERVASIVE AND SO PER VIOLATION IT WAS STILL EXTREMELY. LOW EVEN WE HAVE A SEEM TO HIGH FOR. YOU LOOK AT YEAR AND THE SUPER OF THOSE. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BIG OF FINE. IN TERMS OF THE HARM- THAT WAS INFLICTED ON SO WHAT THIS- WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS TAKE THE FIND THAT EXISTING LAW WHICH IS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER VIOLATION. WHICH WAS SET IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED EVEN FOR INFLATION SEND SEND. AND WILL INCREASE IT TO A FINE OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. PER VIOLATION I KNOW SOME SAID WELL IT'S A TEN FOLD INCREASE FOR TALKING ABOUT A HUGE PERIOD OF TIME. WHERE THIS VERY OUTDATED FIND LEVELS BEEN IN PLACE THAT IS NOT CREATING A DETERRENT IT IS COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN HEALTH CARE IS NOT CHEAP. AND YOU HAVE A LOW FINE PER VIOLATION. BUT UNFORTUNATELY CREATES INCENTIVES TO VIEW IT AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT ABOUT BROAD BRUSHING. OR DEMONIZING THE HEALTH PLANS. A LOT OF THE HEALTH PLANS YOU'RE VERY VERY FREQUENTLY- PROVIDING PRODUCTS COVERAGE AND NOT CAUSING PROBLEMS AND NOT BY ALLOWING THE LAW BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE BAR. THEY NEED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE AND YOU TO HAVE INCENTIVES NOT TO VIOLATE. THE LAW SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. FOR WORKING- WITH US- AND- I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL WORK TO DO WHICH WE'VE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO CONSULT WITH THE COMMITTEE ON- AROUND- FINDING A WAY TO ALLOW ENROLLEES TO RECOVER THEIR FINANCIAL LOSSES- WITH THE INCREASE FIND REVENUE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THAT. RESPECTFULLY I BOOKS. TO WITH ME TODAY ARE- DOES HICKS AND DIANA DOUGLAS FROM ACCESS SPONSOR. THANK YOU AND TO CONFIRM YOU'D VISITED MENTION VILLA SOMEONE I THINK TO ALSO SO. OF SOME NEW THEM REGARDING THE INCREASE THE FINAL. HOW WITH THE AVERAGE PREMIUMS. WITHOUT ANY ANALYSIS- OF OKAY SHE'S WAITING A RED OAK WELL. I'M SURE WE CAN A CLEAR FOR THAT A WHOLE THANK YOU YES IT IS CONSISTENT. EVAN YOU JUST WITH THE CAN YEAH ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE GOING AND THE IN OUR- IN SUPPORT- YEAH JASMINE X- SO YES FOR A PLEASE BEGIN TO MINUTES FOUR MINUTES FOR THE TWO OF YOU. THANK YOU MY NAME IS JEFF ACHES AND I'M THE MOTHER OF TWO TO. AND I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO APPROVE THIS LONG OVERDUE REFORM BECAUSE IN SPITE OF CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT MY FAMILY SUFFERING TO QUINCES OF KAISER'S CONTINUED REFUSAL TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MY OLDEST WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES KAISER OFFERED US A FEW. CENTERS HOME. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- SUICIDAL IDEATIONS GRILLER WITH. KAISER. FOR THERAPY AND- WE WERE TOLD THERE WERE NO THERE AVAIL. SINCE SHE HAS TRIED TO KILL HERSELF TWICE. TWICE HE'S BEEN ON LIFE SUPPORT THE ICU. IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS SHE'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED SIX TIMES. AND EVERY TIME SHE IS DISCHARGED WITH NO FOLLOW UP OR AFTERCARE. IN SPITE OF THE SEVERITY OF HER MENTAL ILLNESS. AND REPEATED IT FOR SERVICES KAISER HAS INFORMED US THAT THEY HAVE NO AVAILABLE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON STAFF AND THEY'RE CONTRACTED THERAPISTS ARE BOOKED SOLID. THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAMS HAVE STAGNANT WAIT LISTS AND HER KAISER PSYCHIATRIST IS PART TIME AND ONLY COMES IN ON MONDAYS SO IT TAKES MONTHS FOR US TO GET AN APPOINTMENT.THIS IS NOT PARITY DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT SHE STILL NEEDS HELP AND WE STILL CAN'T GET IT. MUCH LIKE THE COST. ANALYSIS FOR DID WILL DEVELOPING THE DEADLY PENTAHO. AS THE FINE LEVELS ARE RIGHT NOW IT IS CHEAPER FOR KAISER TO PAY ANTIQUATED FINES THAN TO DO WHAT THEY ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO DO. PSA'S TELL ME TO GET I NEED IT AND WE'RE TRYING WE HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS WITH THIS BILL YOU'LL BE PUSHING KAISER TO DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING ALL ALONG. PROVIDING THAT CARE. INCREASE FINES WON'T FIX EVERYTHING BUT IT MIGHT GIVE MY DAUGHTER AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS. THE CARE NEEDED TO HAVE A HAPPY HEALTHY FUTURE INSTEAD OF ENDING UP AS SAD AND ALL TOO COMMON STATISTIC. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR FAMILY STORY- NOW BRING UP DIANA DOUGLAS FROM HEALTHAXIS. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES PLUS. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DIANA DOUGLAS ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR SB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT WHICH WILL ENSURE HEALTH PLANS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS CALIFORNIANS RELY UPON. THESE PROTECTIONS INCLUDE ACCESS TO BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE LANGUAGE AT. PENDANT MEDICAL REVIEW. PROCESSES FOR FILING GRIEVANCES. DAMAGE THESE PROTECTIONS RELY IN THE STRONG FRAMEWORK OF CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. HOWEVER THERE WERE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN UPDATED MANY TIMES THE PENALTIES THEMSELVES HAVE RARELY IF EVER BUT IT. THE BASIC CIVIL. SOME OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. MANY ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES WHICH REPRESENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PENALTIES IMPOSED TO REMAIN FIXED FOR DECADES. PENALTIES ARE STAGNATED FOR DECADES HEALTH PLAN TO BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO TREATING FINES AS IT WAS ANOTHER COST OF DOING BUSINESS. WHEN IT'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO JUST PAY THE VIOLATIONS RATHER THAN PROVIDE PROPER CARE. CONSUMERS PAY THE PRICE WITH THE LAID CARE DENIED SERVICES IN GRIEVANCES GONE UNRESOLVED FOR YEARS. SB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT WILL UPDATE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES BY MULTIPLYING THE CURRENT AMOUNTS BUT FOR. MOST DAMAGE THE PENALTIES ARE MINISTRY DEVON THESE AMOUNTS OF REMAIN THE SAME FOR SEVERAL DECADES. AND CIVIL PENALTIES WHICH HAVE BEEN CAPPED AT FIVE HUNDRED FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS. WOULD BE INCREASED TO A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. THIS REPRESENTS INCREASES IN INFLATION AND SO ON YOUR PREMIUMS IN COSTS WHICH OF FAR OUT PACED INFLATION. S. FTA WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT S. HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS INCREASED. PENALTIES WILL INCREASE COMMENSURATELY. AND FINALLY S. B. FIFTY EIGHT WILL ADD ADDITIONAL RELEVANT FACTORS THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING PENALTY AMOUNTS. FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDING THE FULL FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE HEALTH PLAN IN VIOLATION. AND HOW MUCH MONEY THE PLAN SAVED BY DENYING THE CARE. WE THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR SUGGESTIONS ON- THANKS WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO SPECIFY- HOW OVER THE PENALTY INCREASES IT WOULD SPECIFICALLY BE TIED TO PLAN INCREASES IT ALSO.

WELL SINCE THEY HAD TO IN THE CITY WILL AFFORD YOU UP THE- AND EXCELLING OF THESE ANTI TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS AND- HOW WE ARE REGRETTABLY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT FIFTY. EIGHT- BUT WILL RAISE HELP COSTS- BY MASS. INCREASING PENALTIES ON HEALTH PLANS AND CREATING A NEW PENALTY STRUCTURE. OUR MEMBERS- AGAIN THE BILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASES PENALTIES ON OUR MEMBERS IN THERE FOR DIFFERENCE MORE MORE RESOURCES AWAY FROM DIRECT PATIENT CARE. AND OUR VIEW KIND OF UNDERMINES THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS. WE DO DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL THAT CREATING MORE AND MORE- PENALTIES ON HEALTH PLANS AND MAKING THE SYSTEM MORE PUNITIVE SYSTEM. WE NEED TO OUT THAT- CAL HEALTH PLANS ALREADY HEAVY REGULATED I'M UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT- THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT HAS VERY WIDE AUTHORITY. TO LEVY DUTIES FROM OUR MEMBERS- THEY CAN ALSO REVOKE THE LICENSE OF HEALTH PLAN THAT'S IN VIOLATION OF THE ACT. AND IN MANY CASES WILL ISSUE CORRECT ACTION PLANS. PART OF THEIR- IF PERSON MECHANISM- AND YOU KNOW WE WILL SAVE YOU KNOW DESPITE WHAT HAS BEEN ARGUED AS LIMITATIONS IN EXISTING LAW. THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN SHY ABOUT LIVING PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES. I'M ON OUR MEMBERS- IN RECENT YEARS- SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS THIS BILL DO BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT COMPLETELY DELETE THE LIMITATION ON CIVIL PENALTIES IN THE EXISTING. LAW AND REPLACES IT WITH THE CEILING SO- I'M SORRY SENIOR CITIZEN CAN REVERSE IT ELIMINATES THE CEILING AND REPLACES IT WITH THE FLOOR THAT IS TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE CEILING. SO- YOU KNOW UNDER THIS BILL THERE WOULD BE NO NO LIMIT THAT WE CAN SEE- ON THE AMOUNT OF CIVIL PENALTIES- THAT COULD BE- LEVIED ON OUR HEALTH PLAN SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A WHOPPING INCREASE BY A FACTOR OF TEN AS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY- TESTIFIED TO. IT WOULD MAKE. THE AMOUNTS OF OTHER SPECIFIED CIVIL TO IMPEDE MINISTRY TO PENALTIES AND IT WOULD- AD IN IT IN ANNUAL INFLATOR- ON TOP OF THAT SO WE THINK THIS IS- VERY VERY VERY PUNITIVE A NEW STRUCTURE ON OUR MEMBERS. KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND YOU KNOW IN TALKING TO OUR MEMBERS ABOUT THIS BILL. THE GOAL OF REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT SHOULD REALLY BE JUST CORRECTS CONDUCT WHEN WARRANTED- YOU KNOW WE ULTIMATELY BELIEVE THAT KIND OF A PROCESS COOPERATIVE PROCESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT LEAVES. AT LEAST IMPROVE CARE- AND ENSURE A PROVIDERS ARE ARE IN PATIENTS ARE FOR THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW- INCREASING PENALTIES IN THE AMOUNT ESTABLISHED BY THIS BILL. APPEARS TO BE PURELY PUNITIVE IN NATURE- AND IN ALL HONESTY WE ALSO THINK IT'LL BACKFIRE. WHAT IT DOES IT PITS PLANS. PART MAINTENANCE AND INSTEAD OF FINDING COOPERATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ISSUES. TO SEE MORE OF A NEGATIVE STANCE- IN THE IN A FIGHTING POSITION IF YOU WILL- WITH REGULATOR. SO. THIS WAS IT WAS REAL THE BILL ABOUT YOU KNOW NINETEEN I THINK YOU KNOW THAT A DIFFERENCE POINT TO COME WIPE OUT THE LIMITS ON CIVIL PENALTIES- AND REPLACING IT WITH THE FLOOR THAT IS TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE CURRENT CURRENT LIMIT- WHICH AS I SATED YOU KNOW THE REGULATORS HAVEN'T BEEN SHY IN OF EXPRESSED. A WIDE LATITUDE IN IN LIVING PENALTIES FAR IN EXCESS. OF WHAT'S WHAT'S BEEN TESTIFIED TO SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND AGAIN WE'RE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. I THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO SB A FIFTY EIGHT YEAR ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED. CENELEC APPROACHING MICROPHONE MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR WITNESSES WHO SHOULD TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT.

YEAH PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF NAME WORKSTATION POSITION. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. THEN ONCE AGAIN LATEST JOB IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. THIS IS YOUR THE TIME WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN OUR QUEUE THANK YOU- WHEN THEY'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. THE MEMBERS. OKAY IT'S BEEN- BY SEVERAL AMOUNT. THE OTHER OKAY SEE NO ONE WITH THE QUESTION OF YES I GONZALEZ OUR COUNTRY. AS I'VE MOVED ABOUT MOTIONS AND OUTSIDE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SARAH. I THINK CEREMONY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. RIGHT ASSENAGON- SIR WIENER AYE I DO SO THANK YOU CAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE- WORKING WITH YOU IN THE SPONSORS. FORD AND PERHAPS- HE CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE VISION SAID WELL GEE YOU KNOW WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT ONLY WE ARE INCREASING THE FINES- WERE YOUR YOUR TO CHANGING STRUCTURE OF THE- LET'S SEE SAID GALGIANI A- CEILING UNTIL FLOOR SO DO YOU DO IT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEARCH THAT. YET WE ARE CHANGING THE STRUCTURE I THINK LONG PAST DUE TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE THIS WAS A STRUCTURE TO CREATE A- IT THAT WAY ALL AND AGAIN I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE'RE NOT SAYING ALL THE- ARE. BAD ALL THE TIME NOT TRUE BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH THINGS. AND WE KNOW THAT AND SO ERROR. FOR MENTAL HEALTH. THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF COVERAGE BEING. EITHER EXPLICITLY OR EFFECTIVELY. HI I'D- AND THERE HAS TO BE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM. DOES NOT CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THEIR APPREHENSION THAT YOU'RE NOW CREATING A FLOOR. BUT THAT WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT'S ENFORCEMENT FLEXIBILITY. TO ACTUALLY IMPOSE A PENALTY THAT CORRESPONDS TO. YOUR AND- IT'S JUST NOT REGIS IT IS AND HOW MUCH HARM HAS BEEN AFFLICTED WITH A SMALL AMOUNT. OR A LARGE AMOUNT- AND- SO WE SHOULD HAVE THAT A MINISTER FLEXIBILITY AND RESPECTFULLY- THE DIMENSI. YOU WHATEVER CRITICISMS CAN LAW TO T. BUT HE'S IS NOT ONE OF THEM- DAMAGE SHE HAS. FRANKLY IN MY VIEW RED IS A- TO REALLY GO AFTER SOME OF THE AND MOST EGREGIOUS ACTIONS THERE BEEN SOME EXAMPLES- BUT I'M UNAWARE OF ANY LICENSE SUSPENDED REVOKED A HEALTH PLAN- AND NOR SHOULD WE BE ENCOURAGING THAT A FIGHT IS MUCH BETTER THAN REVOKING. LICENSE WHERE THAT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR OPTION RIGHT OUT OF THE ABSOLUTE WORST CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO YES I DO THINK PARKING SHOULD HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND THIS BILL WILL CREATE THE POSSIBILITY. HERE WE UNDERSTAND- HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE TO OPPOSITION IN THE THINGS FOR AGAIN APPRECIATE IT. AND SO- AND FEW OF US INTO FOR YOUR- NUMBER ASTRONOMICAL ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THE CAN ON JUDICIARY BEEN SECONDED BY CENTERS MOUNT AND SALAS- I CONSULT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HAND I MELENDEZ EGGMAN EGGMAN AND SALAS CONSULT ON IT GROUP OF- LEYVA LIMA I'VE MON I ROTH I FOUGHT THE. WE. THE BILL'S CURRENTLY SIXTY HOLD THE ROLE OPEN ABSENT THANK YOU RIGHT WILL NOW MOVE ON TO AYE NUMBER FOR S. B. NINE TWO PLACE LIMÓN THE. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. PRECISION MEDICINE IS IMPROVING PATIENT OUTCOMES BY USING THEIR OWN GENES OR PROTEINS BIOMARKERS TO PREVENT DIAGNOSE AND TREAT DISEASES. BIOMARKER TESTING CAN BE PERFORMED FOR CANCER INCLUDING PROSTATE OVARIAN COLLECTOR. FOR BREAST AND LUNG CANCERS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS TYPE TWO DIABETES AND OTHER CONDITIONS. ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS BIOMARKER TESTING IS BROADLY COVERED BY CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN THEREFORE THIS BILL WOULD NOT REQUIRE COVERAGE OF A NEW STATE BENEFIT MANDATES. HOWEVER IN PRACTICE PATIENTS CONTINUE FEEDING BARRIERS IN ACCESSING THIS TESTING. TWENTY ONE SIR BY THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY SOCIETY 66% OF ONCOLOGY-PROVIDERS REPORTED THAT INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BIOMARKER TESTING AS A BARRIER TO BIOMARKER TESTING. SB NINE TWELVE MAKES NECESSARY CHANGES IN THE LAW TO CLARIFY THAT HEALTH PLANS HEALTH INSURANCE POLICIES AND THE MEDICARE HELP PROGRAM ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FORBIOMARKER TESTING. SB NINE TWELVE WILL IMPROVE ACCESS TO BIOMARKER TESTING ENSURING PATIENTS RECEIVE THE RIGHT TREATMENT AT THE RIGHT TIME. TIME CHARACTERS IDLE FOR PATIENTS TO EASE- DOWN DISEASE RECURRENCE OR PROGRESSION AND LEAD BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. ACTUALLY TARGETED. FRIEDMAN REDUCE COSTS BY CAN PAGE TO THE AFFECT TREATMENTS. TO UP HERE WITH US TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS DR SCOTT LIPPMAN OF THE UC CANCER CONSORTIUM AND THAT WE HAVE IN PERSON PETER. TO PROVIDE UP A PATIENT'S PERSON ON BEHALF OF THE UC DAVIS MEDICAL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. I THANK YOU CENTER LIMÓN SO WILL ABOUT TWO OR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE TWELVE WILL BEGIN WITH SCOTT BULLETIN IS OFF THE LAW. LEAPING DOCKED SCOTT LIPPMAN ON THE YOU HAVE TO MINUTES- TO GO OVER TO TIME WE FROM THE NEXT WITNESS. I'LL GIVE YOU TWO MEN OF THE L. TWENTY TWO MINUTES. SO IF YOU WANT THE GO AHEAD GET. DR LIPMAN. THANK YOU THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS PLEASED TO PARTNER WITH ACS CAN. A CO SPONSOR SB NINE TWELVE. WE THANK SENATOR LAMONT FOR HER WORK CHAMPION THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BIOMARKER TESTING FOR ALL DISEASES BUT TODAY I WILL SPEAK THE BIOMARKER TESTING IN CANCER BECAUSE THIS IS THE AREA I KNOW BEST. IN CANCER BIOMARKER TESTING IS CRITICAL IN MANY STEPS OF THE PATIENT'S CARE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CANCER TREATMENT BIOMARKER TESTING IS THE FIRST OF TWO STEPS WE TAKE TO MATCH PATIENTS TUMOR. ASIAN THERAPY THE TESTING OF TUMOR TISSUE OR BLOOD ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT THE TUMOR BIOLOGY AND IT'S VULNERABILITIES AND MAP TO THE RIGHT TREATMENT FOR THE PATIENT WE KNOW THAT PATIENTS TO RECEIVE THESE TARGETED THERAPIES CLEARLY PROVE SURVIVE AND OUTCOMES. ANOTHER ASPECT OF PROTECTING IT IS DETERMINED WHAT DRUGS WON'T WORK FOR A PATIENT'S TUMOR. IT HAD NEXT CANCERS WHICH IS WHAT I PRIMARILY SEE IN MY CLINIC IT'S A TYPE OF TUMOR THAT WILL NOT RESPOND TO IMMUNOTHERAPY. AND CAN IDENTIFY THIS TYPE OF MARKET TESTING THEN THE PATIENT CAN RECEIVE THE RIGHT TREATMENT. AVOIDING UNNECESSARY TOXICITY AND COST. FOR MANY OF THESE PATIENTS TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. MY LAST POINT IS THAT THERE ARE STARK. THIRTY IN ACCESS TO BUY MARKET TESTING FOR BIOMARKER TESTING AND PRECISION THERAPY IN CANCER RECENT DATA SHOW THAT ONLY 50% OF AMERICAN PATIENTS AT FTA RECOMMENDED BY MARKET TESTING DONE. ONLY 39% OF BLACK PATIENTS AND ONLY 39% OF LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS PATIENTS RECEIVED THIS RECOMMENDED BY MARKET TEST. ENSURING THAT ALL RECEIVE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BIOMARKER TESTING WILL HELP TO COME SOME OF THESE BARRIERS TO ACCESS AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE VOTE HI ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO DR PETER KALA- ALL RIGHT IF YOU CAN PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND FORTY NINE SECONDS- I'M A TALK FEST THAT. MY NAME IS PETER CALLA I'M A STAGE FOUR ESOPHAGEAL CANCER SURVIVOR I WAS THERE DIAGNOSED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND GIVEN FIVE TO SIX MONTHS TO LIVE. AS A MEDICAL SCHOOL- IN PHYSIOLOGY AT THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE I NEW ADVANCES WERE TAKING PLACE BY THE WEEK GET ONTHLY AND TREATMENT AND- TESTING. SO I IMMEDIATELY SENT MY- BIOPSY OFFERED GENOMIC AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS. IN THE MEANTIME I BEGAN CONVENTIONAL THERAPY THIS WAS NO PICNIC I MEAN THERE WERE MANY DAYS I WOKE AND WONDERED IF IT WAS GOING TO BE MY LAST DAY ON EARTH. BUT EVEN THOUGH I COULDN'T GET THE TARGETED THERAPY AT THAT TIME BECAUSE IT WASN'T APPROVED. JUST KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A TARGET GAVE ME HOPE AND THAT'S SOMETHING IN VERY SHORT SUPPLY AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. I STARTED SEARCHING FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND I RAN INTO A LOT OF ROAD BLOCKS BUT I WAS DETERMINED IN MY ACT I'M COLLEGES EDWARD KIM FINALLY SNAG ME A SLOT IN THE ONLY SLOT AVAILABLE IN THE NATION WIDE TRIAL. MY SCANS STARTED IT'S STAGE FOUR METASTATIC AFTER THE SECOND TREATMENT WITH THE TARGETED THERAPY THE SCANS WERE DEEMED NORMAL OR NEARLY NORMAL AFTER THE FOURTH TREATMENT IT WORK WEEKLY NORMAL I'VE BEEN OFF THEIR A BE ALL TOGETHER SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I GO BACK FOR SCANS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A CURABLE CANCER. I THINK IT'S BRACKET LISTS AND I FEEL TRULY BROUGHT BLESSED I'LL HUGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO THE UNIVERSE AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AS A PATIENT ADVOCATE TODAY I WANT OTHER. CANCER PATIENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME MODERN PRECISION CARE THAT I RECEIVED. I WASN'T SURE MY INSURANCE WAS GOING TO COVER THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR COST FOR THAT MATTER CAN IN GENOMICS ANALYSIS BUT I HAD THE MEANS THAT I WOULD COULD AFFORD TO TAKE THAT GAMBLE AS A- PATIENT ADVOCATE.

BY MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS DETERMINED TO BE MEDICALLY NECESSARY. AS YOU NO BIOMARKER TESTING IS A PROMISING FIELD AND CERTAINLY USE. THE BENEFIT IS TO SUPPORT MEDICAL LITERATURE. THAT BEING SAID. IT USES REQUIRES CAREFUL OVERSIGHT IN CONSIDERATION WHEN DETERMINING ITS APPROPRIATENESS THE CONCERN OUR MEMBERS HAVE SHARED DEAL PRIMARILY WITH THE VIEW THAT NINE TWELVE COULD INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR TESTING THAT IS BEYOND THE CURRENT STANDARD. CARE HELP. INSURANCE ENSURE THAT PATIENTS THE CARD. THE TAP THE PRO. OF THE- IS BEING ORDERED. BY MY- TESTING IS A- CATEGORY. INCLUDES THE TEST. STAND UPS INCLUDES OUR THAT ARE CLASSIFIED EXPERIMENTAL. MANY TESTING. A CREATED LARGE PANELS TESTS ARE OFTEN TO BECAUSE THE SINGLE TEST IS REALLY ALL THAT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY. YOUR CONCERN THE AB NINE TWELVE IS CURRENTLY DROPPED. TESTING WHICH COULD SWAY SOME POTENTIAL HARM TO THE SYSTEM. AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO.

WELCOME THANK YOU MISTERCHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT SOME REALLY YUMMY FOOD- BUT SPECIFICALLY SENATE BILL NINE SEVEN TWO WHICH WILL MODERNIZE THE CALIFORNIA RETAIL CODE CAL CODE IN ORDER TO INCLUDE SIDE FOOD VENDORS AND BRING THOUSANDS OF MIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS INTO A MORE EQUITABLE AND RALPH WELL REGULATED FOOD ECONOMY WHILE ENHANCING CRITICAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY REGULATIONS I'LL BE TAKING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO REINSTATE THE CAPS IN THE MICRO ENTERPRISE HOME KITCHEN OPERATION THE MAKO AND COTTAGE FOOD LAWS AND NARROW THE NON CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE FINES O ONLY APPLY TO SIDEWALK FOOD VENDORS AS WELL AS- ALL THE IMMENSELY OUT IN THE MARKET BUT I WANT TO. THANK YOU IN THE- FOR WORKING WITH US. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. SIDEWALK FOOD VENDORS STABLE AND CAL COME. AND ARE PART OF THE VIBRANT FOOD CULTURE THAT MAKE THE DISTRICT MY DISTRICT AND CALIFORNIA UNIQUE UNDER THE EXISTING RESTRICTIONS AND CAL CODE. IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR FOOD SIDEWALK FOOD VENDORS TO OBTAIN A LOCAL HEALTH PERMITTED AND FOOD. THESE VENDORS ARE FACED WITH A COMPLEX COMBINATION IN ACCESSIBLE PERMITTING. PROCEDURES EXORBITANT COSTS INCOMPATIBLE EQUIPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS AND PUNITIVE ENFORCEMENT MEASURES. AT NINE SEVEN TWO WOULD ALSO DEFINES A COMPACT MOBILE FOOD FACILITY TO BETTER INCORPORATE SIDEWALK FOOD VENDORS INTO CAL CODE AND MAKE SMALL CHANGES TO THE MAKO. AND THE CFO COTTAGE FOOD OPERATION LAW TO ALLOW SIDEWALK FOOD VENDORS TO ACCESS THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY NINE SEVEN TWO ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING ELIMINATING UNNECESSARY EXPOSURE EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THREE COMPARTMENT SINKS. INCREASING THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO APPROVE INNOVATIVE EQUIPMENT DESIGNED FOR ALL MOBILE FOOD FACILITIES. ENHANCING SITE SAFE ON SITE FOOD PREPARATION OF NON POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOODS INCLUDING HEALTHY FOOD LIKE SLICED FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IN PLACE THE MANUFACTURING OF SAFE AND AFFORDABLE SIDEWALK FOOD VENDING EQUIPMENT AT SCALE. CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE FINES FOR CODE VIOLATIONS. THERE'S AN UNFORTUNATE AND PREVALENT ASSUMPTION THAT SIDEWALK VENDORS ARE SOMEHOW LESS SAFER CARE LESS FOR THE HEALTH OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.

FOOD WHO WERE WHO WERE TRYING TO JUST YOU KNOW BE GOOD MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY LARGE MAJORITY OF STREET VENDORS I KNOW SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE COST PROBLEMS- AND IT'S A MINORITY FOR SURE A SMALL MINORITY BUT AS WE KNOW SOMETIMES A SMALL MINORITY CAN.

ISSUE I KNOW THAT WOULD BE MORE OF A LOCAL ISSUE SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY LOOKS AT MODERNIZING THE FOOD RETAIL FOOD CODE TO GET- FOLKS THAT ARE- NOT IN COMPLIANCE NOW TO GET THEM THE PERMITS AND TO ALSO ENSURE THAT WERE THE GOOD ACTORS AND WE THAT'S WHY TWO TWO OF US ALLEN AND THE VARIOUS. I'M SURE WE CAN FIGURE SOMETHING OUT ENOUGH WHY I'M SUPPORTING YOUR BILL IS SO I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH BILLS A MOVE AYE SIR WIENER SAID RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE HOUSE WANT TO THINK THE AUTHOR- PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND I THINK THAT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE ASKING IN ALL THESE CENTERS TO WORK WITHIN THE LAW BUT YET WE MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR THEM. PERMET IN A IN A WORLD OF FEET AND POSSIBLY THEIR BUSINESS AS ONE OF THE SPEAKERS FOOD AWAY ANOTHER ONE WAS ARRESTED I MEAN WE I THINK IT'S IN OUR BEST INTEREST ALL OF US AS A COMMUNITY TO KNOW WHO THESE VENDORS ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES BUT AGAIN IT'S- IN THE- THESE VENDORS HAVE BEEN PART. OF OUR COMMUNITY SAID LISTEN ARE OUR LATINO COMMUNITIES AND TO AND AGAIN I YOU KNOW WE ALL USE- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AGAIN THEY'RE OPERATING WITHIN THE LAW AND% THAT BY WORKING BECAUSE TO MAKE RED TAPE AND JUST TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT IF WE DON'T HELP THEM EXPEDITE THE PART THAT'S IN AND HELP THEM YOU KNOW SPEAK WITH PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THEN THERE WERE- CREATE. YOU KNOW THE FRONT DESK TO BE UNDER SOUTH I CAN I'M A PRO AUTHOR A AND IT'S I GOT WE DON'T NEED. COSTS IN. TIME NICE SENATE FINAL THE LOS LLANOS NICHOLS HILLS DOES COOKIES. POPPED UP WE ARE LOS GLASSES LOSS AND MODOC ON SILO ABOUT THE CYCLE OTHER TYPE OF OTHER EIGHTY SEVEN WHISKEY GET IT GET IN- DEMOCRAT THEN A LOT LATE IS MOST BECAUSE HE CVO CAN LIST MEASLES ASSIST ANY GETTING MOST CANNOT CLUB  THINK. WHICH OTHER ASSETS AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THAT AND I WILL ALSO JUST OPENING THE MEASURE THANK YOU THANKS SERVICE GROW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IDEA SHE TO STORIES THAT WERE THERE I DO BELIEVE THAT- YOU KNOW YOU CAN A BIT JOB CREATOR OR WRITER. BUT IT ISN'T TOOLS THAT ARE IN THE STREET VENDOR ECKHARDT'S ARE- ENTREPRENEURS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL AND THEY USE THIS TO HAPPEN IF IT THEIR FAMILIES. AND REYES THEIR CHILDREN AND IBM I APPRECIATE THAT. THE CARD- I THINK PEOPLE THAT OWN THEIR OWN BUSINESS REGARDLESS IF IT'S IF IT'S A IF IT'S A- BUSINESS THAT IS A BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESS OR A BUSINESS THAT IS WHAT RETIRED. STREET VENDORS I THINK THE- THIS STANDARD ESTIMATE HOW MANY HOURS I REALLY I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO MODERNIZE A LAW FIRM THAT DIDN'T- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE AN UP REYES AND NOT APPRAISING BUT AN INCREASE IN VENDORS OPERATE THROUGHOUT THE SPEECH SPECIFICALLY LARGE POP HE IS- AND HAVE A LARGE. AND IT. THERE'S NOT LAWS THERE THAT- DIRECTLY FIT THAT THAT INDUSTRY RATES ITS BRICK AND MORTAR AND SO I GET IT ON THAT PIECE AS WELL YOU CAN'T REALLY HOLD A STREET VENDOR ITEND THIS GAME. HE WOULD HAVE HER IS OBVIOUSLY NOT PLAYED A LECTURE FOR OR NOT THERE'S JUST DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT THINGS SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING ABLE TO DO THAT I DO CONCERNS THESE ARE MY CONCERNS. AT THE COPS. AND HOME COMMERCE ISSUES RIGHT SO RIGHT NOW- THE LOVELY WHO TESTIFIED AT THE BEGINNING SAID THAT SHE I THINK SHE SAID IT WAS LIKE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR IT TO. WHERE THEY CENTER SINKS AND THEY HAD A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOOD FOR THE PUBLIC WHEN YOU BUY THE FOOD. M. AND THIS IS THE BILL MY UNDERSTANDING AND IF I'M WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS INCREASE IN COMMISSARIES IS THIS ALLOW- THE HEALTH AGENCIES AND OPERATORS TO- BACK IN HOME SERIES JUST UP NOW. WELL IT. ALL THEM- YOU HOME- COMMISSARY IF THEY WANTED TO MAKE ONLY UTILIZE A- FREE ONE TO BUT THE ISSUE IS WITH SEEN- FROM MANY THE- STAFF THERE. SENSITIVE AND THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSENT BORROW. AND I THINK ONE OF LOCAL. OFFICE PRESENTATION THERE'S A HIGH THIRTY SIXTY OF THAT. THINGS STILL IT. FOR THE- AND WOULD BE ACCESS SORT OF OPPORTUNITY THEM I TO THE CON MOBILE FACILITY EVERY- EVERY BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES TO COMPLY WITH- AND REACHABLE ACCESSIBLE. YEAH THE REQUIRED BY THIS BODY THE QUESTION I ASK YOU WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IS. IF YOU GO TWENTY IN THE SERIES INSTEAD OF ONE THAT IS INSPECTED BY THE STATE OR LOCAL INSPECTORS MAYBE ITS LOCAL INSPECTORS STATE INSPECTORS. WHEN IN COMMENTARY THIS BILL THE NIGHT- THE LOCAL OR STATE AUTHORITY TO INSPECT THEIR IN HOME COMMISSARIES I CAN ASK THAT. EIGHT I CAN ASK A- OUR pMY- AND FROM PUBLIC COUNSEL WHO CAN ADDED. GROUP SPOT WHO IS I'M SORRY IS IT A FROM THE HEALTH- OKAY SIR HEAD- IS EASIER TO SOME HOME OR ARE YOU ALLOWED TO GROW THIS IS A- STORY. AGAIN THAT'S IT PRETTY GOOD QUESTION CHECK. A DIFFICULT HAVING WITH BILL THAT IS UNDER THE CURRENT ROLE WE DO INSPECT THE MICHOS THESE IN HOME RATE WHAT WE WANTED TO BE. THREE TO THE NUMBER OF OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THESE ME BECAUSE BECAUSE FROM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE THEY REALLY STRESSED OUT THE DAY COULD BE STRESSED OUT IF YOU IN THE THIRD FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT SURE HOW YOU CAN. OF CALL- WHERE CAN YOU STORE THEM HOW CAN YOU CLEAN THE MESSAGES SO THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN AS WE MOVE FORWARD IF WE CAN ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN ABILITY TO ONLY PERMIT THOSE MEET CODES ON THOSE ARE CALLED THE CITIES THAT ARE SAFE. WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE TO CRAFT THAT LANGUAGE AND I THINK WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET THERE BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO IN THAT WATER L. COMMENTS BE SAFE AT THIS POINT ARE ON THE PHONE HOW IN PART. TODAY HAVE A LOT. PM THIS IS I THINK TO GET WITH ADEQUATE PROTECTION THANK YOU THANK YOU SOMEONE AND I THINK BEEN SOME ISSUES YES APPLE WE HAVE YOUR DOG FROM HEALTH LAW WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADD ADDITIONAL THANK YOU FOR PROGRESS AND THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS THE STILL NOT. FIVE HOME MR EIGHT CALDERON. F. AND- EAGLE PROGRAM BUT A TRUE DOT. PROGRAM THOSE ARE. PROGRAMS ALLEGE HAS PUT PLACE SAFEGUARD. FOR ON. AND WHO WANT TO USE THOSE PRO AND SO S. B. NINE SEVENTY DOLLARS. IS THAT IT OPENS THOSE UP TO SIDEWALK VENDORS AS LONG AS THEY FOLLOW ALL OF THE EXISTING STANDARDS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE INCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS MENTIONED. I NOTICED THAT THERE IS THE CODE MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CALLED- ACTUALLY HAZARDOUS FOOD AND NON POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOODS OR DISTINCTION BETWEEN MORE COMPLICATED FOOD PREPARATION AND SOME OF THOSE LESS COMPLICATED FOOD PREPARATIONS THAT ARE. WAS LESS HEALTH CONCERNS AND RISKS PENCIL COTTAGE FOOD IS GENERALLY ALREADY LIMITED TO THOSE VERY SAFE MON POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOODS AND THAT WOULD REMAIN THE SAME SO ANY SIDEWALK VENDOR MAKING USE OF THE PROGRAM WOULD. IS ALREADY APPROVED. READ ODD NON. FIRST AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE METER PROGRAMS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS THEY'VE BEEN RAISING VERY IMPORTANT CONCERNS AND CONSIDERATIONS AND SO. ADMINS THAT WERE WERE CIRCULATED EARLIER ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND LIMIT THE VENDOR'S ABILITY TO EXCEED THOSE CAPS. IF THEY'RE DOING THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF NON POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOOD PREPARATION. AND IF THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT QUALIFIES AS POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS FOOD THAT WOULD INVOKE OVERSIGHT FROM THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY WERE. OKAY STAY RIGHT HERE. SO JUST SO I UNDERSTAND IT AND I APOLOGIZE I'M TO THE AUTHOR FOR NOT TREATING THE PRESSURE WAS JUST SO I UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I DO I DO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP I REALLY DO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S AN AND IT. I MEAN AS YOU LIKE IT FOR THEM TO GO TO COLLEGE ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP SO I GET IT WHETHER IT'S A VERY SMALL BUSINESS OR LARGE BUSINESS MIKE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. I WANT TO MAKE THAT. IN HOME TO AN IN HOME COMMISSARY VERSUS PAYING FOR COMMISSARY BECAUSE THERE ARE COMMISSAIRES AVAILABLE SOMETIMES ARE A LONG WAYS AWAY YOU KNOW- MY DAUGHTER BUT THE DUTCH FRONTIER IN HISTORY OF ALL THE WAY LA TO GET LOBSTER RIGHT SO I KNOW. THOSE WITH SMALL BUSINESS PUBLIC HEALTH THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE THEY CAN STILL GO INTO THE IN HOME COMMISSARIES AND DO AN INSPECTION FOR SAFETY TO THE PUBLIC TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE DONE CORRECTLY CORRECT CORRECT UNDER ME GO UNDER MICAH WHICH IS ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAM. OKAY AND- AS WELL AND AS THE OPPOSITION BUT AT. OPPOSE THIS YEAH. EXPANDS AND HAS FIFTY CARTS AND SHE LIVES IN A THIRD LEVEL APARTMENT EXAMPLE RATE IS THAT STILL SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN INSPECT AND ADDRESS FOR CLEANING PURPOSES I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT IWANT THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL EVERY ENTREPRENEUR TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT I WANT TO. OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT. BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE TO DO THAT AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO ASSURE ME HAVE ABSOLUTELY WILL ENSURE THAT GOAL. OKAY THANK YOU.

PROTECTION NO THAT ANYBODY. 95% OR TO DO THE RIGHT THING 95% ALL BUSINESS. DO THE RIGHT THING AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS ONE BUSINESS THAT DOES SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON WHAT THAT BUSINESS DID. YOU TO WRITE. A NIGHTMARE FOR EVERY OTHER BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT. THIS BODY OPERATES AND SO I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT I DON'T I DON'T TO BE A PART OF THAT. I LIKE THE IDEA OF CURRENT TRIP. I REALLY DO- AM I A CREEP EXCEPT. IT WILL GENERATE TAX REVENUE. HELPS PROVIDE FOR PRO. THERE'S A HOLD. OF HUGE. TO THIS. BUT WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS PROTECTED AS WELL AS FOR ME WHICH IS PERFECT. AND GREAT. THANK YOU. GROW BY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND ABSOLUTELY WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THAT GOAL SO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. K.

YOUR CONTINUED YEAH. I'M IN MANY WAYS CEREBRAL- I WAS HAVING THE SAME KIND OF COVERAGE WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS PRIORS WE WERE CRAFTING THE AMENDMENTS- THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY- BECAUSE ULTIMATELY- I MEAN I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE YOUR GOAL OF LET'S TRY TO BRING THE STREET VENDORS- UNDER THE SYSTEM. WITH THE PERMITS AND SO FORTH. BUT ALSO THE PERMIT ITSELF HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING RIGHT IT IS THIS IS YEAH- SO I LOVE THE LICIOUS FOOD. I JUST DON'T GET SICK FROM IT I HAVE SEEN PATIENTS GOT SICK FROM IT AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL THIS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF COURSE PUBLIC SAFETY I KNOW YOU SHARE THIS. AT THE END SO I KNOW THIS IS BY. I'M GOING DIALOGUE WILL POINT OUT THAT- YOU KNOW YOU TO KALONYMUS. WILL BE. THE PACK CARE. CAP BACK ON. WE'RE HAVING SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SO FOR EXAMPLE- I DON'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE HAS A MAKERS AND THEY'RE RUNNING. ACTUALLY FIVE FOOD CARTS OUT AN ERROR RATE- SO BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE COMMERCIAL FACILITIES THAT ARE. IN YOUR TEMPERATURE AND WE GET ALL THE DETAILS. AND THAT MAY NOT BE SAFE HOWEVER. THAT ONE AND THE EXTENSION OF THAT- BECAUSE AND THAT. IT OKAY RIGHT SO WHAT WE WANTED. THIS FOR THE ENTREPRENEUR. AND SO FORTH- IN THAT SAME TIME YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT OF COURSE CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE AND- IN TERMS OF- FOOD SAFETY SO. I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS I REALLY APPRECIATE TAKE A MINUTE AND OTHERS FOR THEIR WORK TO DO SO FOR EXAMPLE- I AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES BUT SOME POINT WHEN SOMEONE'S. UNFORTUNATELY BEING A PERSISTENT THAT'S THAT FIVE OR THREE OR 21% THAT JUST YOU KNOW. BOOKS LIKE THAT YOU'VE BEEN TELLING THEM AND- FINING THEM AND THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO GET IT MAYBE YOU DO GET IT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE BUSINESS. THEN WERE WORD DETERS ACROSS PAL AT. GET A REP. FORD SEPT POINT SOMEONE WHO CLEAR IS PETERLEE VIOLATE OVER OVER AGAIN AND NUMEROUS EFFORTS AT EDUCATION WARNINGS AND SO FORTH WE CAN LET TO CONTINUE SIR FUND FOOD RIGHT AND ENDANGERING THE PUBLIC SO I KNOW YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THAT SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT TOLD ALSO TESTIFIED LIKE YOU KNOW. HOW TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT AGAIN- DON'T DOESN'T ENDANGER- IMMIGRANTS DID INDEED PUBLIC TO. ENJOY DELICIOUS FOOD AND- AND- NOT REGRET IT THE NEXT DAY- THIS. IS OF WHAT YOU SAID SIR I'M SORRY SIR YOU SEEN THERE'S ONLY ADMINISTRATIVE- AND ACTION TAKEN IF SOMEBODY BLATANTLY DISREGARDS THE LAW AND DOESN'T COME.

HEALTH AND FOOD CODE NUMBER AFTER MORE LOCAL ISSUES I DON'T I'M GONNA DRESS AND I DON'T WANT TO CONFLATE THE TREND AND MAKE THAT ALL OF THE STREET FOOD VENDOR ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT IS. WORKING THE CITY LIKE SAN SAN FRANCISCO TO ADDRESS THOSE OKAY TO MAKE THEM COMPLETELY FROM THIS BILL JUST LOOKING AT AGAIN MODERNIZING THE RETAIL HELP. I JUST HAVE A. MINUTE PENALTIES FOR. YOU FOR. AND YOUR- RIGHT NOW I THINK IT UP. REYES CELL AGAIN I KNOW THAT- AND WE HEARD THE- STATE YOUR WORKING WITH. A MENTAL OFFICER I WANT THAT ONE OF A KIND OF THAT YOU BROUGHT IT UP ALSO BY DOES ONE BRING IT UP IS THAT- CERTAINLY I'VE HEARD. FROM PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT- SOMETHING ELSE THAT DID ISSUES IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ZANUCK APPEARED OTHER OTHER AREAS- AND WE NEED. BUT YOUR BILL FOCUS IN MY MIND ON THE FOOD SAFETY PART RIGHT AND SAYING THAT WE WANT TO BRING PEOPLE IMMIGRANTS OTHER PEOPLE. IN UNDER THE PERMITTED SYSTEM AROUND FOOD SAFETY WORKING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. SO WELL CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THESE OTHER ISSUES. I GUESS I WOULD SAY IS I HOPE AND- I KNOW THAT SURROUND AND WE'RE NOT HEARING HIS BILL HERE TODAY BUT- ACTUALLY THE ISSUES THAT. YOU WANT THE DRIPS REALLY ON HEALTH COMMITTEE ISSUES PER SE. SO I THEY ARE ON THE DRESS WE NEED TO. THE ISSUES BUT- IT'S NOT REALLY THE ROUND THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I THINK YOUR BILL IN MY MIND IS TO ADDRESS. THE HEALTH CODE ISSUES AND WE SHOULD PERHAPS THINK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHAT INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES. THAT SHOULD BE TO DEFICIT I THOUGHT RELATED BUT THEY'RE SEPARATE IT'S NOT REALLY I MEAN. IT'S IT HAS TO DO WITH IT. FIFTY IS I'M SORRY APPRECIATE SO IN MY MIND- THIS BILL SHOULD CONTINUE BEFORE I CONTINUE TO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION I KNOW YOU FIXER COMMITTED TO SAYING THAT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THINGS- NEED TO HAVE- PERHAPS STRONGER. TUNES IN TERMS OF CODE AND SO FORTH- VERSUS THE PARTS THAT WE CAN JUST LEAVE ADMINISTRATIVE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS RIGHT AGAINST THE FOR THE REPEAT. REPEATED OFFENDERS RELATED TO FOOD SAFETY- THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN DON'T HAVE PERSISTENTLY HAVE UNSAFE FOOD IN THE- AREA- THAT UP BY A FEW PEOPLE NOW DAPHNE WE WANT TO LOOK AT HOW TO PROVIDE PEOPLE EVERY OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO. SERVE FOOD STREET HAS IT THAT BUT AT THE L. SAFELY SO WE'LLLOOK AT THE PENNY ON THE NATURE FOOD AND SO FORTH SO BUILDING ON THE WORK THAT YOU FRIEDMAN AND OTHERS HAVE DONE AS WELL. SO AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK I THINK IT'S AN ONGOING PEACE WORKS RPG TAKING AND THEN IT'S BY DUKE'S HOPE TO SEE FURTHER PROGRESS- AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE FLOOR BUT I KNOW THAT- THAT- THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT THE SPONSORS.

THE RESULT AS WELL AS DIAGNOSTIC BREAST IMAGING FOR WOMEN WITH GENETIC RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH BREAST CANCER- THE BILL WAS SUGGESTED TO ME. BY A CONSTITUENT WILL ALSO BE HERE TO SHARE SOME TESTIMONY- SO I'M EXCITED TO IT CAME FROM SOMEONE IF I JUST WITH THE- WE IN FRIENDS WHO. DID BY THIS ISSUE TO WE'RE HERE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS BREAST CANCER IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG WOMEN HOWEVER EARLY DETECTION IN BREAST CANCER DRASTICALLY INCREASES THE RATES OF SURVIVAL. WHILE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING DETECTS 8290% OF BREAST CANCERS IN WOMEN WHO HAVE NOT YET MANIFESTED PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS SUCH TRAININGS CANNOT ALWAYS ADEQUATELY. RIGHT ENTER. SEE THAT MURDER IS ALSO CANCER WHO HAVE A GENERIC WRITTEN GENETIC RISK FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH BREAST CANCER INCLUDING CAMRY FAMILY HISTORY ARE KNOWN GENETIC MUTATIONS OFTEN NEED TO UNDERGO FOLLOW UP TESTING TO ENSURE THAT THE ABNORMALITY IS NOT CANCEROUS HOWEVER WOMEN ARE REQUIRED TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THE FOLLOW UP TESTING THAT CAN COST HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SUCH BECAUSE MANY WOMEN FRANK DELAY OR AVOID THESE APPOINTMENTS UNFORTUNATELY THE LONGER IT TAKES TO DETECT BREAST CANCER THE HIGHER THE CHANCE OF UNSUCCESSFUL TREATMENT. EARLY DETECTION CRITICAL WITH ME TODAY I HAVE- OBVIOUSLY SENATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WHOSE CAN OFFER SOME COMMENTS AND THEN WE HAVE DOCTOR LARISSA WROUGHT FROM THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND GUINEY PATAKI IN WHO IS THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THE ISSUE TO MY- ATTENTION AND THEY'RE BOTH YOUR TESTIFIED.

AND SO BUT IT FEELS A LITTLE RIDICULOUS I KNOW I HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME EVERY YEAR WITH MY PROVIDER WHEN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT RUNS IN MY FAMILY. HAVE A HISTORY MONSELL I THINK THE CONSTITUENT FROM IS THE PRINTING. THIS VOTE. IF IT THAT TIME ALREADY. HE SEEMS TO. I AND I WANTED THE SENATOR ON THE COMMITTEE THE WORK ON THIS AND WITH.

COLLEGE OF OBGYN DISTRICT NINE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE SPONSORS OF SB NINE SEVENTY FOUR. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME TODAY. I WANT TO BEGIN WITH A BRIEF EXAMPLE OF ONE OF MY PATIENTS. MARIA THE FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO FOLLOWING HER ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM WAS TOLD SHE HAD INCREASED BREAST CANCER RISK YOUR FAMILY HISTORY AND SHOULD HAVE AN MRI. SHE DID THIS BUT THEN RECEIVED AN EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL AS HER INSURANCE DID NOT COVER THE SIX. SHE TOLD ME SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT MRI IF SHE HAD KNOWN IT WOULD BE. OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE. THE COST OF COMPLETING BREAST CANCER SCREENING SHOULD NOT BE A BARRIER TO APPROPRIATE SCREENING. DURATION LIKE THIS OCCUR ALMOST DAILY IN MY PRACTICE. UNDER THE ACA SCREENING MAMMOGRAM IS COVERED BUT IN ABOUT 10% OF CASES THE IMAGING OF ABNORMAL OR DEEMED INCOMPLETE FOR INTERPRETATION. AND ADDITIONAL STUDIES ARE REQUIRED. THIS CREATES A HEAVY BURDEN ON THE PATIENT SPOKE EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY WHEN SHE MUST PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THESE ADULTS I THINK. FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WHAT COVERAGE FOR HAVE ASKED. WITHOUT BECAUSE SHE INDICATED WHEN RISK BASED ON FAMILY HISTORY OR GENETIC MUTATIONS X. TRAINING THAT. ENABLES EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND THIS RESULTS IN DECREASED CANCER MORTALITY IN WOMEN OF AVERAGE RISK. ALL BACKED FOR FALSE POSITIVE OR INCONCLUSIVE RESULTS NEXT THE STAFF TO TAKE FURTHER IMAGING CAUSING ANXIETY STRESS AND FINANCIAL BURDEN SB NINE SEVENTY FOUR WOULD ELIMINATE THE COST SHARING BURDENS AND REDUCE THE PREPARED CARE TO COMPLETE SCREENING PROCESS. AFTER CONSIDER AND SUPPORT OF SB NINE SEVENTY FOUR BUT THE HEALTH OF WOMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS- GUY AND- G. C. CAN HOPEFULLY PUT AN END TO THE SKIN OKAY WELCOME THANK YOU HI THANK YOU DR PAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DIANA POSSESS YOU KNOW I'M A RESIDENT OF GLENDALE CALIFORNIA. SB NINE SEVEN FOUR. THE END OF FOR WITH ALLEGE. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO SAVE LIVES WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER DETECTION WITH DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING HELPING NOT JUST WOMEN WHO ARE AFFECTED BY FAMILY FRIENDS AROUND THE- WHEN A WOMAN ADVANCED SCREENING THAT'S SCARY AND STRESSFUL. I KNOW BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH THIS MYSELF I WENT FOR MY OWN SCREENING BECAUSE OF THE RAMPANT AMOUNT OF BREAST CANCER. AROUND ME INCLUDING MY MOTHER AND TO GET MY OWN FRIENDS HAVE TESTING. THING NEXT. BILL AND THEN THE BURDEN OF HOW DO I PAY FOR THIS IS AWFUL AND UNNECESSARY. WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA CAN NOW KNOW THAT YOU TOOK THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THEY ONLY HAVE TO GO AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. TO GET THEIR NECESSARY MAMMOGRAMS WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT OR HAVE TO WAIT TO SAVE UP FOR THAT DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING WITH CRUCIAL TIME PASSING. THE EIGHTY AND- PHONE OF. NICE THIS WITH MY- BROWN ME IS AN ALARM FROM MY OWN ALL GIRL HIGH SCHOOL I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT THAT I RECEIVED THANK YOU TO SENATOR PORTANTINO AND TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED THIS MEASURE ON BEHALF OF ALL THE WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA.

I DON'T THINK I WILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. THE OPPOSITION THAT WE OFFER TODAY- IT WITH RESPECT OF COURSE IS IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER IN S. B. E. A FIFTY THREE SB. NINE SEVENTY FOUR IS- CERTAINLY A VERY WELL INTENTIONED BILL UNFORTUNATELY DOES COME- ALONG WITH A COST INCREASE FOR EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE PREMIUMS SO. LOOKING AT THE CALIFORNIA. AND NOW. THIS PARTICULAR BILL IT HAD A FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE WHEN IT CAME TO PREMIUM INCREASES IF THE BILL WENT INTO EFFECT. IN REGARDS TO EMPLOYEE PREMIUMS THOSE WOULD RISE OVER TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO. LOOKING AT THE BILL AND ISOLATION IS ONE THING BUT LOOKING AT IT- CUMULATIVELY WITH THE OTHER MANDATE BILLS THAT HAVE COME ALONG THIS YEAR ESPECIALLY JUST WITH THE MANDATE WE HEARD EARLIER- JUST MANDATES WE HEARD TODAY WOULD BE AN EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR PREMIUM INCREASE FOR EMPLOYERS IF THEY ALL WENT THROUGH AS DOES. SO THAT'S THE CONCERN. IS THE COST OF CASH THE COME ALONG WITH THIS ESPECIALLY TO THE NUMBERS I CITED EARLIER A- JOB BASED ON. ONLY CAN HELP YOU WITH OVER TWENTY TWO DOLLARS ANNUAL SO WE LOOK AT HEALTH CARE COST DRIVERS WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT ABOUT WHATTO DOING THAT SO AGAIN IT'S A RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION IT'S A VERY WELL INTENTIONED BILL- BUT THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE OPPOSITION TODAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CONSIDERATION.

FORTUNATELY THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN CANCER PATIENT ACCESS TO SPECIALIZED CARE SB NINE EIGHTY SEVEN ALLOWS PATIENTS TO ACCESS THE EXPERTS OF THE LATEST ADVANCEMENTS IN CANCER CARE TO PROVIDE THE MOST OPTIMAL CARE FOR PATIENTS THESE TREATMENTS INCLUDE GENOMIC TESTING PRECISION MEDICINE BASED CARE SUBSPECIALTY EXPERTISE AND CLINICAL TRIALS NINETY SEVEN THE CALIFORNIA CANCER EQUITY ACT WILL IMPROVE CANCER CARE ACCESS AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVE CANCER CARE OUTCOMES FOR MANY FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DOCTOR HARLAN. LEVAN PRESIDENT OF THE US STRATEGY IN BUSINESS VENTURES FIRST TO BE OF HOPE AND ON THE PHONE I HAVE AUTUMN OGDEN DIRECTOR OF STATE LEGISLATION FOR THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY WILL BEGIN WITH A DOCTOR HARLAN LEVINE FROM THE CITY OF HOPE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES- TOTAL FORM IS BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU SO YOU GO OVER. SHE HAS LESS TIME AND I WILL GIVE YOU TWO MINUTE CALL IF WE WILL GET TWO MINUTES A WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON THAT SHERMAN PANDA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BEFORE COMING TO CITY OF HOPE COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER AND AFTER YEARS OF COMMUNITY PRACTICE INTERNAL MEDICINE MY CAREER FOCUSED ON VALUE BASED CARE AND POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT ALTERNATELY SERVING IN EXECUTIVE ROLES AT UNITEDHEALTH GROUP AND ANTHEM TO HELP CONTROL COSTS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES. THESE ROLES I WITNESSED CHARACTERS UNIQUENESS DUE TO ITS PACE OF INNOVATION THE GROWING PROMISED AND COMPLEXITY OF PRECISION MEDICINE. AND THE FACT THAT THE BEST CHANCE OF CURE IS THE FIRST CHANCE SECURE. I CAME T SEE THE CANCER CARE IS INDEED DIFFERENT SYSTEM TO EMBRACE THE DOES THIS DIFFERENCE LIVES WILL BE UNNECESSARILY LOST. THIS YEAR MORE THAN A HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S WILL HEAR THE TERRIFYING WORDS YOU HAVE CANCER. THANKFULLY OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS MORTALITY RATES HAVE DECREASED BY THIRTY ONE PERCENT. BUT NOT MANY CONNECTS ACCESS THIS AMAZING INNOVATION DRIVING THESE IMPROVEMENTS. AND INDEED THE GAP IS WIDENING FEWER THAN HALF A CALIFORNIA CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVE CAROLINE WITH NATIONAL GUIDELINES TODAY. THIS TUITION IS WORSE FOR. SOMEONE TO SERVE COMMUNITIES. THE STUDY PUBLISHED BY THE UC DAVIS CENTER OF POPULATION HEALTH SHOWS MEDICARE PATIENTS DO WORSE THAN THOSE WITH OTHER TYPES OF INSURANCE AND IN SOME CASES DO WORSE. THAN THOSE WITH NO INSURANCE AT ALL. MOREOVER MEDICARE PATIENTS. CELESTE BE MINCED CLINICAL TRIALS OR CARE FROM SUBSPECIALISTS LIKE THOSE AVAILABLE AT THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE DESIGNATED COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTERS. THE CALIFORNIA. CANCER CARE EQUITY ACT WOULD CHANGE THAT AND REMOVED A KEY BARRIER THAT PREVENTS CALIFORNIA MINORITIES AND THOSE FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FROM ACCESSING APPROPRIATE CANCER CARE. SOME WILL ARGUE THAT THIS IS DISRUPTIVE TO THE STATUS QUO AND INCONVENIENT FOR THE HEALTH PLANS THIS. SURGICALLY AFTER TO ADDRESS. I DEFINED IN RELATIVELY SMALL LIST OF CONDITIONS WHERE OUTCOMES ARE THE MOST VARIABLE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. AND ARE BOTH ADDRESSABLE AND AFFORDABLE THIS TYPE OF COVERAGE MODEL ALREADY EXISTS THE MEDIC CAL FOR OTHER LIFE THREATENING NEEDS LIKE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT AN ORGAN TRANSPLANT AND OTHER RARE GENETIC DISORDERS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE. THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW THE NIRVANA. FOR THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE TO STAND IN THE WAY OF ALLOWING ACCESS TO THE RIGHT EXPERTISE FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF VULNERABLE CANCER PATIENTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PASSAGE. AND ASK FOR YOUR I.

AND CURES FOR PATIENTS AFFECTED BY CANCER. HOWEVER MANY CANCER PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX THERE ARE NO SEATS. ARE NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT. FROM THE KNOWLEDGE AND LEVEL OF CARE. THERE IS NO DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO CARE FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS. AND MEDICAL PATIENTS HAVE A LESS THAN FAVORABLE FIVE YEAR OUTCOME. ALTHOUGH MOST CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVE QUALITY CARE IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. MANY CASES PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX CANCER DIAGNOSES REQUIRED THE EXPERTISE. ON THE LATEST ADVANCEMENTS IN CANCER CARE TO PROVIDE THE MOST OPTIMAL CARE. CLINICAL TRIALS. CONTROL AND THE CARE CAN PATIENTS. NPR DESIGNATED CENTERS PROVIDE STATE OF THE ART RESEARCH AND CARE THAT WILL IMPROVE THE SURVIVAL OUTCOMES FOR THESE PATIENTS. OUR CURRENT ONE SIZE FITS MOST SYSTEM PREVENT YOU MANY. CANCER PATIENTS REMAIN. OPTIMAL CARE AND YOU MANY OF OUR POOR AND UNDER RESOURCE CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT THEY NEED.

AT CENTERPOINT CHARACTER LIKE THE BILL I MEAN I DO I- MY OFFICE THIS PAST TWO WEEKS IS HELP TO PEOPLE- THAT NEED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND GET THROUGH THEIR INTERVIEW AND SLICK SPECIFICALLY JUST FOR CANCER- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE EITHER SOMETHING- THAT DON'T HAVE INSURANCE FOR REASON. AND YOU KNOW IT WAS HEART WRENCHING STORIES SO I GET I DO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO WITH IT MY ONLY CONCERN AGAIN BEING FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE WELL IS THAT MANDATING THAT THESE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ORGANIZATIONS ARE BROUGHT IN. AT THE MEDICAL FACILITY. OR THE MEDICARE PAYMENT SYSTEM. I'M PROBABLY USING THE WRONG WORDS IS THAT THERE'S NO COST NEGOTIATION RIGHT IF THEY NEGOTIATED. THAT I UNDERSTAND THERE'S NO COST TO GO SOLUTION SO I GUESS ARE THEY GOING TO BE UNDER THE MEDICAL FEES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS OR IS THERE GOING TO BE. THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SET THE STANDARD AND SET THEIR OWN FEES SCHEDULE OR WILL THEY BE UNDER MEDICARE FEES THAT'S THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE. I BELIEVE. I'M SORRY YOUR MICROPHONE I SAID I BELIEVE THEY'LL BE UNDER THE MEDIC CAL FEE STRUCTURE THEY WILL YES SO EVEN IS NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AS KIDS OKAY YES HELLO YEAH YEAH THEY'LL BE GLAD TO MOVE THE BILL AND I HAVE TO GO BACK TO RULES OKAY BILLS AND MOVE A CENTER GROVE. OTHER QUICK. OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY ALL RIGHT- SO- SCENE THOUGH OTHERS- AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF- AND- AND PRESHEAF- YOU KNOW DRESSING MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE THAT WERE RAISED- BY. NIANTIC WILSON THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION- THIS IS. WHAT COMES THE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND- AND MEDIKAL- YEAH PART OF IT IS LIKE WHAT YOU DO PEOPLE WHO HAVE- RARE CONDITIONS REQUIRE REALLY HIGHLY SPECIALIZED CARE RIGHT SO WITH OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM WE HAVE SENSE ECONOMY BY COUNTY OR MAYBE COOPER COUNTIES. ETCETERA AND EVEN WITH COMMERCIAL PLANS DEPENDING ON THE AREA RIGHT HOW HOW BROAD THEY ARE NOW DO WE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO CARE. I THINK WE'VE NEGOTIATED THAT THERE'S A- A GROUP THAT'S GOT ME LOOKING AT WHICH ONE THE RARE CANCERS THAT BEST FIT THIS THAT PEOPLE MOST BENEFIT. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND YOU POINTED OUT THAT- THERE'S THAT STUDY FROM UC DAVIS- THAT SHOCKINGLY SHOWS THAT- MEDI CAL PATIENTS ACTUALLY- GOT. TO THE CANCER OUTCOMES WERE AS BAD AS PEOPLE ARE UNINSURED AND MUCH WORSE THAN PEOPLE WHO WERE- COMMERCIALLY COVERED NOW THERE'S SOME. TAKE THE STUDY HAD SET UP BUT- WE NEED TO DO BETTER I MEAN MEDICAL IS OUR PROGRAM IS OUR STATE PROGRAM WE DO SURE MUCH BETTER CARE AND THIS. THIS IS A STEP FORWARD IN DOING THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT ISSUES THAT- I GUESS I WOULD JUST MENTION BUT AGAIN I YOU. WAS PRIVATE. YOUR IS LIKE TO WE JUST CARD ALL THE IF. BUT INTO ALL THESE BY MANAGED CARE PLAN BUT- I I'VE BUT I ALSO. THAT THAT'S THE WAY WE PAY FOR THINGS AND- SO HOW DOES A PLAN BUILDING A RISK. IN THAT CASE SO WITHOUT GETTING OVERLY TECHNICAL- SO I THINK THERE'S PERCENT POTENTIALLY POLICY DEBATE ABOUT THAT BUT- THAT WOULD BE- CAL. FORGIVENESS HEY WE'RE INTEREST HAVING THAT OF. NOT I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST TIME. WILL JUST DEAL THE WAY YOU'RE PROPOSING IT AND THEN AND YOUR SPONSORS AND BUILD IT INTO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS- BUT IT I THINK IT IS REALLY ESSENTIAL THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS AND AS YOU POINTED OUT THE RATES ARE SET TO THE MEDICAL RATES- HOPE. THAT- THE PEOPLE TO GET ACCESS TO THIS CARE. SO AGAIN. YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD- THE STRIPES AND SOME ADDITIONAL WORK TO DO BUT- WE I THINK WE- ADDRESS A LOT OF ISSUES IN THE AMENDMENTS. AND AND REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR WORK THERE SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH I JUST THINK YOU DARK THANK YOU DON'T. OUR STAFF AND MICE. HERE'S SOME. THE BOTTOM IS THE INSTITUTES- HAVE THE TOOLS TO HELP.

WITH CAN I CAN BY MELINDA'S EGGMAN. EGGMAN I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I GREW HER TADO LEYVA LEÓN. LIMON I ROTH. RUBIO WIENER. OKAY THE GARBAGE FOUR ZERO ALL THE ROLE OPEN FOR A THE NEXT ITEM- IT WILL BE A CENTER HERTZBERG HERE SO WE'RE GOING TO SKIP UP. YOU GET THE WORD AYE I'D SPOKEN WITH CENTER CORTESE GAVE ME A COURTESY TO LIVE TO GO BEFORE HIM OKAY THAT'S THAT YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE HERE- SO WE'RE GOING TO. MOVE ON SO WE'RE GOING TO SKIP ITEM TEN FOR NOW UNTIL SENATE FOR TV SHOWS UP FOR NOW WE'VE GOT. AN NUMBER ELEVEN SP TEN FOURTEEN BY CENTER HERTZBERG WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCH SHERMAN MEMBERS- LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING STAFF. CHALLENGING ISSUE TAKES A LOT OF HOMEWORK AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR BEGINNING YOUR STAFF FOR DOING HOMEWORK ON THIS AND MAKING THE BILL BETTER I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. IT'S A LOT WORK IN YOUR EXPERTISE. SO LET ME START OUT. LET ME START OUT BY FRAMING THE ISSUE AS I SEE IT. THE RATE OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AMONG CALIFORNIANS HAS RISEN AS WE ALL KNOW TO HISTORIC LEVELS THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING. THANKS TO THE ROBUST IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND IT'S WILL STATE POLICY MEANING AREAS TO MEDIC CAL IN ROMANS WE CAN PROUDLY SAY THAT WE LEAD THE NATION. IN PROVIDING UNIVERSAL ACCESS. BUT HERE'S THE RUB MEMBERS MISTER CHAIRMAN HERE'S THE RUB. UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS MEANINGLESS UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS MEANINGLESS IF IT DOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO TANGIBLE BENEFITS ESPECIALLY FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS OR OUR COMMUNITY CLINICS AS WE KNOW THEM ARE CENTRAL TO OUR MISSION IN DELIVERING QUALITY CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. THEY'RE THE BACKBONE THE COR STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S SAFETY NET AND OFFER SERVICES TO ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED FEDERICO THE FIGHT HEALTH CENTERS OPERATED BY OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY PUBLIC AND NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE AND I STRESS PRIMARY CARE BECAUSE YOU KNOW DOCTOR HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS DENTAL CARE AND BENEFITS AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS AND MEDICARE AND OUR MEDICARE POPULATION. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS SERVE NEARLY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS PER YEAR. AND MEDICARE RECIPIENTS MAKE UP SIXTY POINT CLINICS PROVIDE CARE TO ONE THIRD OF ALL MEDICARE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS IN OUR STATE THEY ARE AS I SAID THE FRONT LINE. WITH THE CONTINUED GROWTH FOR SAFETY NET THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS LEGISLATURE THIS COMMITTEE AND NEWS. THE NUMBER ONLY GOING TO GROW AND CLINICS ARE UNDER IMMENSE PRESSURE TO RAPIDLY INCREASE OUR CAPACITY TO MEET THAT DEMAND. YET UNSURPRISINGLY MEMBERS CLINICS ARE SEVERELY UNDER RESOURCED ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE SAFETY NET. ALEX FACE CRIPPLING WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AT INCREASINGLY HIGH TURNOVER RATES AMONG THEIR CARE GIVERS. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION WHOSE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL REPORTS TO US HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE A MEDIAN TURNOVER RATE OF EIGHTEEN POINT SURVEY. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE JUST THE YEAR BEFORE THE TURNOVER RATE WAS SEVEN POINT 6% SEVEN POINT 6% A YEAR LATER THE TURNOVER RATE EIGHTEEN POINT. HOW LISA STOP THESE CRITICAL CLINICS WITH SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE THIS IS A TIME WHEN CLINICS NEED. TO ONLY RETAIN THEIR WORKERS BUT ALSO NEED TO BE STAFFED UP TO MEETING INCREASING DEMAND FOR CARE AS I SUGGESTED. THE NUMBER ONE BERRY TO COMPLEMENT IN RETENTION IS COMPETITION WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR WORKERS. CLINIC SALARIES ARE MUCH LOWER AS WE ALL KNOW THAN THOSE PAID BY COMPETING PROVIDERS AND WORKERS ARE INCREASINGLY DISSATISFIED WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES OF THE FRONTLINE WORKPLACE CONDITIONS. SO GIVEN THAT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHAT SHOULD WE DO AS A LEGISLATURE WHAT IT MEANS OR CRACK THAT CLINICS ARE AT A CROSSROADS WHERE IT IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO HIRE AND RETAIN STAFF TO SERVE PATIENTS AND MISSIONS TO. TAKE CARE OF FOLKS. IT ADEQUATE CLINICAL STAFFING MEANS LONGER WAIT TIMES AND DIMINISH CARE NOT ACCEPTABLE. WHICH MEANS PATIENTS ARE SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS WE CAN'T TOLERATE THAT ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES JUST SET US FURTHER BACK. IN OUR MISSION TO ACHIEVE GREATER HEALTH EQUITY. THE LADIES HAVE A DEVASTATING AND LONG TERM AND LONG LASTING IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES WHO CAN LEAST SHOULDER THAT BURDEN. SO HOW DOES THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. SOLVE THIS ISSUE THE MEASURE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE LONG STANDING WORK FORCE SHORTAGES ND ENSURE THAT WE CAN DELIVER QUALITY CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE. THIS BILL S. B. TEN FOURTEEN CREATES AN OPTIONAL NEW SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAM A NEW TOOL IF YOU WILL. FOR CLINICS TO TAP INTO DESPERATELY NEEDED RESOURCES. ALLOCATED FUNDS WILL ALLOW CLINICS TO HIRE AND RETAIN CARE GIVERS INCREASED TRAINING AND INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS FUNDS WILL BE USED TO PAY CLINIC WORKERS A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FIFTEEN DOLLAR AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE IS A LOT OF MONEY BUT LET ME TELL YOU COMPLEMENT NOT CHANGED COUNTY. IN ORDER TO FOR HIS. A MINIMUM WAGE IF THE NINE DOLLARS AN HOUR. BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IT'S IMPORTANT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES BUT IT IS A BIG STEP FORWARD. SO THIS MEASURE SB TEN FOURTEEN. ENCOURAGES COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN CLINICS WORKERS AND PATIENTS FOR RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. THESE PARTNERSHIPS WILL FOCUS ON CREATING PATHWAYS MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR HEALTH CARE CAREERS IN CLINICS PROVIDING TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND PAYING COMPETITIVE WAGES AND BENEFITS IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES APPROPRIATE GUARDRAILS. TO ENSURE THE FUNDS DIRECTED IMPROVING CARE INVESTING AT THE CLINIC HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. THE RISK A SHOULD ASK PARK IS PART OF THIS MEASURE OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS RUNNING PARALLEL TO THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THE LETTER HAS FORTY TWO MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE OF BOTH HOUSES IN SUPPORT OF THAT BUDGET REQUEST. AND WITH THIS INVESTMENT THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE AN ADDITION. SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING. THIS MEANS WILL BRING A TOTAL OF A BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW REVENUE TO SUPPORT OUR CLINICS AND ACCESS TO CARE. AND I STRESS THIS BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE PAY IN CALIFORNIA TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HOW MUCH WE CONTRIBUTE THIS IS ONE OF THE PLACES THAT WE CAN. GET SOME OF OUR OWN TAX DOLLARS BACK THAT ARE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS PAY GETS FORTY IN FAIRNESS IN THE PROCESS. THE LIKELY FROM CLINICS OPPOSING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THE CLINIC BUDGET SHORTFALL IS DUE TO LOW MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND WE'VE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN MANY TO. AND I DON'T DOUBT THAT THIS IS THE CASE MEDICARE WAS UNDERFUNDED IT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. THERE IS NO QUESTION YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE SHOULD BE THINKING OF EVERY CREATED INVENTIVE IMAGINATIVE INTELLIGENT APPROPRIATE WAY TO BRING NEW RESOURCES AND TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO PROVIDE CLINICS WITH THESE SUPPLEMENTAL DOLLARS. THIS BILL. SUCH CREATIVE MECHANISM. BY STRENGTHENING THE CLINICS WORKFORCE IMPROVING WAGES AND BENEFITS MEMBERS WE STRENGTHEN CLINICS CAPACITY IMPROVE CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND DO WHAT'S CORE TO OUR MISSION HERE AS A GOVERNMENT IS TO TAKE CARE OF FOLKS. AND TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF IN A THOUGHTFUL AND INTELLIGENT WAY. HE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ALICIA WALKER A MEDICAL ASSISTANT. ON EVEN CLINICA. N. CARLOS OF LUCK GOT IT ALL OF LIKELY CUT REAL MODEL ALSO IS OUR STATE IS ON SHE SHOULD BE HALF OF THIS YEAR YOU.

BUT IT'S A STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF WE ARE PULLED IN TWENTY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS PATIENTS WAIT LONGER AND DON'T GET THE FULL CARE THEY DESERVE TOO MANY GREAT MEDICAL ASSISTANCE LEAD BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE WORKING AT LIFELONG THE HEY IS THIS TOO LOW TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILIES THAT'S WHY I HAD TO LEAVE. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I WAS MAKING. M. S. IN FAR LEFT INTO A GOOD JOB IN SAMPLE. I'VE BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER JOB AT SIX AT STANFORD HEALTH CARE WHERE I WAS PAID OVER THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. IT WAS WHAT I NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY BUT I ENDED UP SPENDING FOUR TO FIVE HOURS A DAY DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK. I HAD TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AND THE COMMUTE MEANT THAT THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM LIKE I NEEDED TO BE. SO I LEFT STANFORD AND CAME BACK TO LIFE FONG THAT MEANT THAT I WILL WENT FROM THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR TO NINETEEN. FOR THIS ANGEL. SO TO MAKE ENOUGH SUPPORT MY FAMILY I WAS WORKING A SECOND FULL TIME JOB AT NIGHT AT UPS. SO MANY OF US LOVE OUR JOBS AND THE WORK THAT WE DO. BUT WE END UP LEAVING. IN THE END IT HURTS THE PATIENTS.

SAVINGS DUE TO THE MATH CALIFORNIA'S YOU TRANSITION. VISIBLE THIS WAS A CLINICS APPLY IT FIVE THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING A- LEVELS GAUGE MEANT. INTEGRATE PART IN HEALTH CARE. AND MANAGE THE ARRAY OF BENEFICIARY HEALTH COMPLEXITIES. THIS IS STILL ONGOING AND HAS BEEN EXTREMELY TOUGH BE. BREAK. WELL GOVERNOR SUPPLE. PROGRAMS FROM OUR UNDER EXPECTS MEDICARE DOLLARS RESULT IN NEW OR- BENEFITS. TO MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES. THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHAT NEW SERVICES WILL GROUP BE REQUIRED IN SB TEN FOURTEEN. INSTEAD IT APPEARS INTENT OF SB TEN FOURTEEN IS TO PAY FOR SALARY INCREASES. HOWEVER SALARY COSTS ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN HOW CAN HEALTH CENTERS GET PAID WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE PPS RATE. THE HEALTH CENTER RECEIVES A PAYMENT TWICE FOR THE SAME COST THE STATE WILL RECONCILE THOSE DOLLARS BACK AND FORCE THE HEALTH CENTERS TO GIVE BACK THE MONEY TO THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY WHILE SB TEN FOURTEEN SUGGESTS THAT THIS PROGRAM IS VOLUNTARY ONLY AFTER EACH USE WHO PARTICIPATE IN A BONA FIDE LABOR MANAGEMENT CLOCK WHAT BRACING COMMITTEE WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO ACCESS THE WORK FORCE FUNDS. THEREBY GREATLY DIMINISHING THE IMPACT. KIDS IN OUR MEMBERS AT OUR MEMBER HEALTH-CENTERS ABSOLUTELY OUR EXPERIENCE WORKFORCE CRISIS AND WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THIS YEAR WE HAVE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION CENTER. WE WERE BACK OPPOSE THE BILL UNLESS IT'S AMENDED TO ENSURE CMS WILL MATCH THE PROGRAM AND THAT ALL HEALTH CENTERS CAN PARTICIPATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANKS VERY MUCH WELL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS IS IN OPPOSITION- KOREAN SANCHEZ- YOU HAVE OF THAT- IN MINUTE AND- THIRTY FIVE SECONDS TWO MINUTES. UNFORTUNATELY YOU MISTER MEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S KOREAN CONSCIOUS CEO PRESIDENT L. PERIPHERAL BODIL. SAN FERNANDO CEBU WILL VALLEY. AB BEEN. GIVEN THE SERENA THE PAST THIRTY YEAR. WE SERVE A POLICY THIRTY THOUSAND PATIENTS AND HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND VISITS A YEAR. OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THESE MANY YEARS OF COURSE IS THE WORKFORCE AND EVEN MORE SO WITH A PANDEMIC. WE FEEL VERY B. IN THIS PROBLEM AND CHALLENGE AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE DEPARTMENT. OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS TO INCREASE OF THE LABOR SHORTAGE HOWEVER THE MAIN CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT COULD YOU PRINT EQUITY THE ALL OF OUR CLINICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS MONEY. THERE IS A MANDATORY PROVISION YOU CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THIS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A LABOR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. SO I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS. IS NOT ALL OF BENEFIT ALL OF US AND WE ARE MANY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT. OF FOR LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS EVENTS TRAINING PROGRAMS AND- FUNDING FOR HEALTH CENTERS. SO I US WITHOUT OF FURTHER DO THAT THERE THIS BILL BE AMENDED BE LOOKED AT CLOSER IT'S IT LOOKS REALLY SIMPLE IN THE FRONT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE NEED.

GONZALEZ SAYS THANK YOU DOCTOR CAN I JUST WANTED TO- I KNOW I HAVE. CAN HONESTLY I AM GOING OF COURSE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SURE SINCE WE COME FROM THE SAME. ARIANNA AND THE SAME PUNISHED ST LOS ANGELES WITH TO JUST HAVE THE- OFFICE. AND THE POINT THAT THEY'RE MAKING ADDRESS BECAUSE THERE IS THE COMMUNITY CLINIC LETTER AND- DON'T I KNOW THAT I'VE I'VE HEARD A LOT FROM BACK HOME AS WELL FROM VARIOUS. CLINICS THANK. YEAH BE HAPPY IT SEEMS TO BREAK DOWN BECAUSE THE CAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPPOSITION IS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES. ONE IS WHAT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOING TO DO YOU KNOW- THE HHS RECEIVED MASS WERE THEY GONNA DO. WITH THE REAR. THEY HAVE BUILT. PROGRAM INTER THEIR CONTRIBUTION EXTRAORDINARY FLEXIBILITY. IF YOU LOOK TO BOND. SECTION NINETEEN OH TO BE BE OF THE SECURITIES ACT HOUSE THE FLOOR BILL. EIGHTY THE ARSENAL LIKE THIRTEEN TO ONE SAVINGS IN TERMS OF THAT THAT'S NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING I THINK IT WAS A GREAT DEAL OF ISSUES ABOUT URBAN VERSUS RURAL THAT'S NOT OUR NECK OF THE WOODS IN L. A. COUNTY. IF THIS OPTION WAS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE INTENT OF THE BILL I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND AMENDMENTS. TO ON THESE THESE ARE- LABOR MANAGER CORPORATION COMMITTEES THEIR REGIONAL IN NATURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ONE SET UP OKAY IN YOUR OWN CLINIC THE COULD BE REGIONAL FOR THAT WILL ACTUALLY DO THE TRAINING. SECONDLY THE AMMO YOU THAT HAPPENED OPENLY YOU COVER. I'M NINETY DAYS AFTER YOU GET THE MONEY SO IT'S NOT LIKE PUBLIC HOUSING GOVERNMENT WHICH ALWAYS THE CASE- WILL PROMISE YOU SOME MONEY AND THREE YEARS LATER YOU MIGHT GET HALF RIGHT. YOU GET THE MONEY UP FRONT YOU GET THE CASH CASH CASH THAT THEY WITHIN NINETY DAYS YOU HAVE TO SET UP THE TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WORKS WHICH REGIONAL TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES AND AVOID THE PROBLEM IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH CLINIC IT ONLY RELATES TO THE TRAINING OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT DIDN'T HELP. THE LARGER ISSUE THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE FACING SO WHAT WHEN I LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMING THROUGH WITH THE WAIVER YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE FLIGHT BILL IF BILL IN TERMS OF THE STRUCTURE WE'VE GONE THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE WITH A CLICK WITH. EACH ONE OF THESE WITH THE SPONSORS AND EACH ONE OF THE LETTERS THAT WE RECEIVE. A LETTER HE- BROKEN ON THE PARTICULAR AREAS OF THOSE WHO JUST MISSED THE CASE. THANK LATE. ON IT. IT IS A- OTHER ISSUE PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK IS YOU HAVE TO BE UNIONIZED ANSWER'S NO. THAT IS NOT IT. THE LABOR COMMITTEE THE LABOR MANAGEMENT COOPERATION COMMITTEE DOES HAVE UNION MEMBERSHIP. BUT NOBODY WILL. BE IN YOUR NOT BECAUSE- LOOKS THEM UP. YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE TO ONE. SAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PAY PEOPLE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR PRETTY GOOD THING AND YOU GET A BIG PILE OF CASH. AND TO. YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR TRAINING WHICH IS READ IN NATURE. THAT AND COMMITTEE DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT OF YOUR CLINIC GOVERNANCE SO I DO THINK YOU KNOW PART OF THE NEWNESS OF WHAT HAPPENS IS WE ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS. AND TIME FOR THE BILL TO JERK EIGHT AND IDEAS TO GERMINATE THESE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN BUT WE'VE GONE THROUGH EACH ONE OF THE LETTERS THAT WE RECEIVE EACH ONE OF THE PAYMENTS THAT WAS- AND- DOUBLE WE'VE COME UP WITH A PRETTY INTO. OF COURSE ALWAYS WORK WITH ANYBODY BUT THE COURT MESSAGES YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PAID AND YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THE TRAINED AND WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE COMMUNITY CLINICS OR STRONG FOR PER A PROPER CARE. COMMUNITY IS A SPECIAL WHAT WE'RE ON ABOUT. I THINK THAT THERE RUBIO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST WANTED IT BUT ALSO COMMENT ON THIS YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S VERY IT'S A IT'S A GOOD BILL BAD NEWS. POSSIBILITIES OF OPPOSITION AND YOU KNOW THESE ARE YOU KNOW ORGANIZATIONS THEY USUALLY MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION WITH THE SAME GOALS AND YOU KNOW SUPPORTIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY B- FOR COMMUNITIES IN GENERAL I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S THERE'S A LITTLE DISCONNECT HERE YOU KNOW AND- AND I THINK I HEARD JOB. THE LADY FROM OUTRAGE LIVE AUDIO TALK ABOUT THAT THEY WERE ALREADY WORKING TOWARDS SOMETHING. I SO CLEARLY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A AND YOU SAID IT MISCOMMUNICATION. HOUSE BE. SAFE ABOUT MOST PEOPLE THEY CAME UP ARE FEELING OR- ON THE PHONE ARE FEELING LEFT OUT OR PERHAPS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR. AND AGAIN IT YOU KNOW AS YOU SAID IT'S A GOOD PROGRAM BUT I FEEL THAT MORE CONVERSATIONS NEED TO HAPPEN. AT TICKETS SUCH AS NO BY EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT ALL THESE GROUPS NORMALLY MOVE TOGETHER AND THEN YOU HAVE. MOST OF AN OPPOSING HERE TODAY SO. THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM FOR ME. I WILL SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I LIKE IT SENATE BILL BUT AFTER EVERY. ALSO LONG AND I WOULD. GET GIVE US. CAN I READ THE- YEAH THE CURRENT SUCH AS IN FRONT MINE FOR MAYBE THIRTY FIVE MAYBE FIVE A LONG TIME AND UNBELIEVABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT SHE DOES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENT- WE HAD A MEETING BEFORE THIS AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID PART OF JUST THE VOLUME METRIC ACTIVITY SINCE THE PANDEMIC OF NUMBERS OF NEW BILLS PICK LARGER MORE COMPLEX BILLS I DO THINK WOULD YOU SAY IS CORRECT IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION. CAN HAVE TO THIS MANAGER COOPER KUPP CORPORATION COMMITTEE BUT THAT IS REGIONAL ALL MY GOD THAT'S- THAT IT IS INVOLVED. IN THERE BOB MET THEIR MANAGEMENT ALL THAT'S GREAT RIGHT SO THE WORLD LOT OF ELEMENTS EXACTLY RIGHT OF JUST US. WHERE THERE'S SO MANY CLINICS WHERE IT'S SUCH A BIG ISSUE WHERE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO OUTREACH WHICH WILL CERTAINLY DO. AND BILL THAT LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION BECAUSE EVERY TIME I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS TO EXPLAIN THAT TO EXPLAIN THE SPECS ABILITY WITH RESPECT TO. HHS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CMS AND HOW THAT WORKS AND WHAT THOSE CODE SECTIONS ARE IN SOME OF THOSE THAT WE WENT THROUGH WITH THE- COMMITTEE CLINICS SOCIAIS HAITIAN AND RESPONSE- LETTER. I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE A LOT CLOSER TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO. WELL I JUST MAKE OUR COME IN I KNOW YOU SAID IT'S A YOU KNOW IT'S- THE INTENT IS REGIONAL BUT I ALSO HEARD. COLORS CALLING FROM. OUR LIMITS IF I REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION I THINK IT'S A- IT'S IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- A LOT OF FARMWORKERS. STATIONS I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE GOT A CALL TO- BUT EITHER WAY I'M JUST MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS. THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN AND TALK TO YOU AND LIKE I SAID JUST. CLARIFYING SOME OF THE I GUESS MISSING IN MASS COMMUNICATION AND EVEN AS HE SPOKE TO. CAREEN FROM BRIEF LEVINE SAID IT STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH ITSELF JUSTIN INDICATING SAID LITTLE BIT MORE THE NASA FINESSING IN A LITTLE BIT MORE. INCLUDE VIDEO ONLINE AND YOU HAVEN'T BY. FILLING OUT I JUST HOPE THAT YOU WILL GETTING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE AND CONTINUE TO REALLY DRILL DOWN ON. THE TRACK PLAINNESS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE WILL AND THE PATTERN IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE LETTERS THAT WOULD SUPPORT PERCENT POSITION THERE WAS A LARGE CHUNK OF THAT WAS. THAT THIS PHASE. URBAN VERSUS. OUR CLINIC. IF THE PROCESS UP EACH IN THE- LABOR MAY. CORP COME. AND THAT'S WHY THE CLARIFICATION IN THE COMMITTEE. DISCUSSION WHICH SIX STAFF WAS VERY HELPFUL ON. THAT SAYS THEY CAN BE REGIONAL SO. A NUMBER OF CLINICS CAN COME INTO THAT AREA. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO SET UP THEMSELVES AND BECOMES EASIER WITH LOOK AT THIS PATTERN WITH THE FARMER ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER GROUPS. THAT REALLY WAS ABOUT THE REGIONALLY SPEECH WITH WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. HELPING RIGHT. WE'LL GET THAT OUT THANK THINK IT WAS LIKE ABOUT US COMPASS. I WAS TRYING TO GET RID. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION I APPRECIATED HER. CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU. AND I DON'T NEED A LONG EXPLANATION. I NEED A YES OR NO. THAT'S ALL I NEED. BECAUSE I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE OPPOSED. ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE GOING TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE SAY WE'RE GONNA IMPROVE THE CLINICS FOR EVERYBODY. THAT EVERYBODY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS. AND HELP THOSE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR CURRENT. AND A BETTER IS. MEANT TO GET YOU TO WORK WITH PEOPLE. THAT THE HAVE A FULL. YEAH IT DOES I JUST. CHRISTINE JUST TELL ME THE ANSWER DOES. THE ANSWER THE QUESTION YES. BUT THE ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR WHICH I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE BEYOND A YES ANSWER. IS THAT THERE IS A DISTINCTION. IT'S THIS SUPPLEMENTAL COULD MONEY CALMS AND THESE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS COMMON THERE IS A TENSION. WHICH EXISTS IN THIS BILL WHICH WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET RID OF. IN TERMS OF THE SPONSORS SEIU. IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE PROCESS. AND IT'S NOT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO BE UNIONIZED THAT WAS MENTIONED. IN A RECORD TO BE PART OF THE UNION BUT THERE IS SOME TENSION ABOUT THE HAS RICHEST. YES ONE OF. WAIT THEY DON'T GET THE EXTRA MONEY IN TERMS THE SUPPLEMENT. SO IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IT'S CLEAR THAT WILL WORK TOGETHER WITH THEM BUT THERE WILL STILL BE TENSION. FROM SOME GROUPS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY IF WE WANT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MISTAKE COULD HELP US HERE. OUGHT TO CLARIFY THAT TO MAKE SURE ANSWERS THERE BUT I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE MY CASE IN RESPONSE TO MY YES ANSWER. THAT MAKES SENSE. NO BUT I UNDERSTAND THANK YOU. AT SURVEILLANCE THANK YOU SO JUST TO DOVETAIL ON TO WHAT SENATOR EGGMAN ASKED I JUST I THINK WE NEED MORE CLEAR ANSWER FROM YOU BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VERY REAL CONCERNS COMING FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY WILL BE LEFT OUT AND I THINK IN YOUR COMMENT YOU WERE SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE- PART OF THIS GROUP ARE TRYING TO THIS UNION BUT YOU DO HAVE TO. HAVE CERTAIN WEIGHT WHICH WOULD BE- EXCLUDE MANY OF THESE CLINICS THAT WERE TALKING BECAUSE THEY JUST WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PAY THAT WAGE SO. YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY WE DON'T HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS GROUP BY THE REALITY. HAVE A OTHER CHOICE. ON ACCESS TO THE MONEY AND NOT BE LEFT OUT IN THE COLD SO I JUST WONDER. IF YOU COULD BE A LITTLE MORE CLEAR IN WHAT YOU'RE PROMISING HERE TODAY WITH RESPECT TO WORKING WITH THE GROUPS. WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION WHO ARE FEELING LEFT OUT YEAH WELL THE REALITY IS THAT FIRST IT'S OPTIONAL SO IF YOU WANT ACCESS TO THIS PART OF MONEY. IN ORDER TO DO SO YOU'VE GOT TO AGREE TO PAY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR WHICH WILL THESE PART OF MONEY WILL FUND. DISAPPOINTED MLLION PLUS THE SIX REMAINING SUING THE FEDS AGREE SUCH A BILLION DOLLARS. AND SECOND YOU'VE GOT TO AGREE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS- LABOR MANAGER. BRAYSHAW COMMITTEE. TO DO SO IF YOU AGREE TO THOSE TWO THINGS. YOU GET ACCESS TO THESE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO PLAY THOSE ADDITIONAL MONEY IF YOU DON'T. AND YOU CHOOSE NOT TO. THEN YOU'RE NOT PART YOU'RE NOT PARTICIPATING. IN THIS- THE PROGRAM UNDER TEN FORTY. OKAY AND THEN ONE FINAL THING- BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- IT FOR ACCESS TO THIS MONEY NEW SERVICES MUST BE PROVIDED SACRAMENTO NO NO NO OKAY SO THEN LET US FLEXIBILITY IN THE PROGRAM SALINAS DR PAN CAN TELL YOU BETTER THAN I CAN. THE BILL THE PROGRM. FOR HIS. ACTIONS WITH A PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL DOLLARS- AND- CMS ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT- THAT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO. THESE NEW SERVICES HELLO IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR THE BULK REALLY THE REALITY IS THIS MONEY WILL BE GOING. I MEAN- MOSTLY TOWARDS- SALARY INCREASES THE STREET IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT AND WE NEED SALARY INCREASES BECAUSE WE'RE LOSING PEOPLE. ABOUT I MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE TURNOVER FROM 187% 18% AND THE PRESSURE THAT ORGANIZING SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN COMMUNITY CLINICS ARE PROPERLY PAID. SO THAT THEY CAN STATE THAT THEY'RE PROPERLY TRAINED AND THAT THEY PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SAFETY NET WHICH IS SO CRITICAL OKAY A DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT'S A CLEAR- BUT ACCORDING TO MY ANALYSIS IT SAYS IT CMS REQUIRES. THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PROGRAMS PROVIDE FOR NEW SERVICES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THAT ARE NOT ALREADY PAID FOR YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT YES YOU DO. ASSEMBLY THIS FLEXIBILITY IN CMS AND I BELIEVE IT DOCTOR PAN MIGHT BE BETTER IF YOU WANT TO GIVE SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR MAYBE THEY CAN. MAKE SURE AND MAKE A STATEMENT ON THAT BUT I IT'S GREAT CORRECT OKAY. FROM MR THE CHAIR WHILE I'M NOT SURE I THINK DOCTOR PAN HAS SOME INPUT I DON'T KNOW THAT- THIS YOUNG LADY SHE'S THE TECHNICAL PERSONS ATTACKED OKAY. THAT'S WHAT THE COURT OR SOMEBODY ANSWER THE QUESTION PLEASE. OKAY WELL WANT TO TAKE A CRACK FIRST CRACK AT THE ANSWER I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPORTING YOUR WITH THAT HAVE AN ORDER SAID AND THEN IF WE COULD ALSO HAVE PERHAPS THE OPPOSITION- HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN IS ONE THAT BE GREAT GO HEAD. ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE SO THAT'S HOW YOU CAL. SO THE WAY THE- L. A. IN THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW THERE IS FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THEIR IT'S DESIGNED AS A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS BUT AND WE KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN. MULTIPLE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY CMS. THAT FOR FEEL DIFFERENT CRITERIA THE FACT THAT THIS SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PROGRAM IS ATTACHED TO QUALITY METRICS. IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE THINK THAT THIS THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY BE- THOSE. CMS QUALITY METRICS WILL BE SET BY DH CS AND SO THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND CONTROL TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN IT TO- WORK WITH THE FEDERAL AND STATE RULES HAVE ANY CONVERSATIONS BEEN HAND WITH CMS RELATING TO THIS ISSUE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH DHS ON THIS SO FAR. SEN OKAY NO NOT YET NOT YET I MEAN THAT WOULD BE HAVE NOTED SORT OF HAVE THE CONVERSATION PRIOR TO ALL OF THIS TO KIND OF GET US A FEELING FOR WHERE THEY ARE BUT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE- THE INPUT. DID K. SEVEN MEDIA JUST THE WAY AND LOCAL CARE. THE OPPOSITE SO MEDICARE OF COURSE IS A FEDERAL STATE PARTNERSHIP SO IN ORDER TO GET THE WAIVERS GOTTA WORK WITH CMS AND IT'S THROUGH THE HCSO CMS'S USUALLY NOT INTEREST TALKING EVERYBODY THAT WE TALKED TO THE EIGHT CST EXCESSES IN THE STOCK RIGHT- THERE IS FLEXIBILITY BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF RULES THERE SO I THINK PART OF WHAT WE TRIED TO DO AND- LOOKING MY CONSOLE THE- SAME RON HERE. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE OF. THEM IS TRY TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT CONVERSATION A DH CS- TO SEE WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO PULL DOWN THE FEDERAL FUNDS SO. IN SOME SENSES THE ANSWER IS KIND OF IN BETWEEN SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT CMS IS WILLING TO DO SO THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY IN SCOPE. THAT YOU NOTICE THAT YOU HAD THE UP WITH. THE USER. THAT PROPONENTS SAYS. SHE DID YOU SAY YOU CAN GO TO SAUDI COULD IT HAS TO BE TIED TO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. CELLS I THINK BOTH BOTH OF MY BEING ACCURATE IN THAT SENSE THAT YOU HAVE TO SHOWS. IT CAN'T IT. CAN'T JUST BE PASSED STATUS QUO BUT- EXACTLY WHAT IT IS- THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE SO IF FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT- BECAUSE THE- HELP. THAT TURNOVER AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS MAY LEAD TO POOR QUALITY. THAT WE CAN STILL IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY AND RETENTION AND SO FORTH CERTAIN QUALITY MEASURES CMS MAYBE OPEN THE SAME GOOD. HE GETS MORE FUNDING BECAUSE OF THAT WE DON'T KNOW UNTIL THE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAD WITH CMS SO I THINK WHAT WE CRAFTED THE AMENDMENTS OURS TO SAY THAT. WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR- NEGOTIATION WAY OUT THE ALSO THAT- NO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT JOHNNY HAS TO APPLY ACROSS CLINICS RIGHT SO IT'S- YOU CAN'T JUST A SUBSET OF THE CLINICS WILL HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. AND AND THEN AFTER THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IS TAKING. ONLY BE SURE. THE SYSTEMS UP. OKAY WELL THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION BOTH THE VIEW I WONDER IF- THE OPPOSITION MIGHT WANT TO COME UP IN JUST ON INDY IS IT OKAY INDIGNITIES COME YEAH I WISH I COULD CITE YOU A RULE BOOK BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS- WE'VE BEEN TALKED. OUT UNFORTUNATELY TWO EIGHT SEIZE IS EASY- BECAUSE OF HOW WE ARE REGULATED THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO THAT BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY CHALLENGING SO- S. P. P. IS NOT RELATED TO FQHC WE TRIED SO MANY WAYS TO MAKE THE S. B. P. FOR THE PHARMACY TRANSITION WORK IN THE WAY THAT WE COULD IMAGINE IT FOR SUBSETS OF PROVIDERS FOR TARGETING THE DOLLARS IN A MORE SPUR SEIS WAY WORLD IRVINE BASED NEED BASED ON TYPES OF PROVIDERS AND THERE WAS WE FOUND BASICALLY NO WAYS TO DO IT- THAT THEIR PAY. A LOT FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAID I AGREE WITH EVERYBODY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE IN PRIMARY CARE CMS BELIEVES I THINK IN SOME WAYS ARE PAYING TOO MUCH. SO THEY WANT EVIDENCE THAT IT'S NEW AND IT'S FOR BENEFICIARIES AND THEY ARE ALREADY IN THEIR MINDS PAYING FOR SALARIES IN OUR PPS RATES AND WE- WE AGREE. WE CANNOT KEEP UP WITH SALARY COSTS. THERE IS NO WAY PPS ALSO IF SALARY COSTS BECAUSE OF INFLATION GO UP 20% TOO BAD FRIEND Q. EIGHT C. IS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT YOUR PPS RATE TO MOVE THAT THAT'S NOT A TRIGGERING EVENT IT DOESN'T COUNT. SAM IN THE STATE WITH THE PARTY THOSE COSTS YOU HAVE TO FIND IT A DIFFERENT WAY. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FROM. WITH THE- AND DISTANT FOR HEALTH CENTERS WAS LARGELY GOING TO SALARY COSTS. AND EXTENDED HOURS AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND WE COULD NOT FIND A WAY TO MITIGATE IT WITH THE S. P. P. BASED ON THE RULES THE DH CS SAID. THEY UNDERSTOOD CMS WOULD APPROVE OR NOT SO WE ARE GOING BASED ON. THE GUIDANCE THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM DTS AND WORKING SO HARD TO TRY TO JERRY RIG PROGRAMS. AND SALARY INCREASES FROM OUR EXPERIENCE WE'RE NOT. AVAILABLE THE NEW THIS IS DO HAVE. THANK YOU MR. STILL HERE. SHE LEAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND I'M ASSUMING YOU WERE LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY IN THE HALLWAY OKAY SO MA'AM- I JUST WANTED TO. BUT YOU KNOW YOU YOU HEARD SENATOR HERTZBERG TALK ABOUT HOW IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT TO BE- PART OF THESE LABOR AGREEMENTS IN THESE UNIONS THAT THAT BUT THERE ARE SOME CONDITIONS. TO HAVING ACCESS TO THE MONEY ONE WOULD BE OF COURSE TO PAY THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR IN WAGE AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD WEIGH IN ON WHAT. WHAT TYPE OF THE FACT THAT WOULD HAVE ON THE CLINICS- YOU KNOW THAT AREN'T PART OF THESE- UNIONS IN THE ONES PERHAPS YOU'RE HERE REPRESENTING TODAY YEAH THANK YOU ACTUALLY CAN I JUST ONE PROPOSAL FOR YOUR SUPPORT BY GOVERNMENT IT COMMITTEES AT SELF. PASSED THE GAVEL ON TO MY VOICE OKAY BACK TO CANS GOING TO GO OUT ON BOATS IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE HE WILL BE BACK I PROMISE OKAY. OKAY SIMI'S INTEREST PLEASE GO HEAD SO THE IMPACT- IS FOR. MANY OF US THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. DID REVISIONS THAT UPGRADES OF TO UP OUR MINIMUM WAGE WHICH YOU KNOW IS NOT ONLY THE INITIAL INCREASE BUT ITS ONGOING. BUT ONCE GOT PEOPLE ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE YOU HAVE TO BUMP UP I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE. KIND OF DOMINO EFFECT THAT TAKES PLACE. SO WE I'M AN EXECUTIVE SHOULD HAVE TAKE ALL THAT IN CONTEXT SO WE DO THAT RIPPLE EFFECT WHICH WE DID IN THIS LAST RUN AFTER OF CODE THAT- THERE'S A POSSIBILITY LAYOFFS. BECAUSE YOU CN MAINTAIN THAT YOU CAN'T SUSTAIN THAT. WE HAVE LIMITED BUDGETS WITH LIMITED PERSPECTIVE PAYMENTS FROM THE FEDS AND SO. WE FILL IT COULD RICOCHET BACK IN THE PEOPLE WILL LOSE JOBS RENDON GAME WHERE MANY PEOPLE ARE GONNA LOSE JOBS. AND WE'RE ALREADY SHORT STAFFED WITH THIS FOR YOUR I JUST TO MAKE SURE HAVING FULL CONTEXT YOUR YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING TO THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT IT'S CLEAR. THAT THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH HOW THIS GETS IMPLEMENTED IN WHO IS INCLUDES THE THANK YOU MISS SANCHEZ I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THANK RESIDENTS THAT MENTOR. I'M SORRY REGISTER YES OF COURSE BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT IS A CIRCULAR ARGUMENT. RIGHT WE HAVE LAOS WILL LOSE IN FRONT LINE WORKERS WHO ARE EXHAUSTED WORKING IN THE CLINICS THE STORIES ARE EXTRAORDINARY WE WANT TO OFFER HIM A LIVING WAGE SO THEY CAN WORK IN THE CLINICS. AND SO. UPPERMOST PART OF MONEY THERE'S TWO SOURCES ONE IS FROM THE STATE ONCE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I COULD TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THEIR WAGES TO THE STATE AND SO THE ARGUMENT IS WELL WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THEM AT LOW WAGES SO THEY CAN'T STAY SO WE CAN KEEP EXECUTIVES AND HIGHER WAGES I MEAN AT SOME POINT THE ARGUMENT GETS RIDICULOUS SO YES THIS IS A REALLY IMPACTFUL AND IT'S ONLY IT'S BASICALLY JUST YOU KNOW THE AGREEMENT TO PAY WORKERS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF RECEIVING THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. BECAUSE THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN IT'S NOT LIKE OH YOU GOT APPLY FOR SOMETHING WAY DOWN THE LINE AND CLOSELY GET PAID BACK YOU GET THE CASH AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO PAY THEM AFTER. THEN PURCHASED. FINALLY MANAGING COOPERATION COMMITTEE WHICH WILL BE REGIONAL IN NATURE. SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO OUR DATA SHOWS SIGNS THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW. BUT BASICALLY OREGON DID THIS INTER UNDER THE- SAID THE QUOTE I GOT IT THE STATURE I GAVE YOU UDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION STATURE THEY GAVE YOU. THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IT NINETY DAYS. AT THE ARGUMENT ISN'T JUST ABOUT WAGES. THE ARGUMENT IS ABOUT QUALITY OF CARE. THE ARGUMENT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE HAVE SOMEBODY HHS WAS A CALIFORNIAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THE CHALLENGES OF CALIFORNIA. IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS BREAKING. THAT THE PRESSURE IS KILLING US THAT. THERE'S AN IN A PRIMARY CARE WORKERS AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IT AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OREGON THEY DID THE SAME THING NEW YORK. NEW YORK HAD A SITUATION WHERE THEY WERE ABLE IMPLEMENTED A SIMILAR PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSED PRIMARY CARE NEEDS OF THEIR MEDICARE POPULATIONS OREGON DID THE SAME THING. THAT WE DO HAVE PRECEDENCE OF OTHER JURISDICTION'S DOING THIS WITH CMS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WAGES. THERE'S A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAGES AND THE SYSTEM WORKING. AND SO WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WE FEEL CONFIDENT REGARDLESS FLEXIBILITY IN IT AND THAT WE'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY SITUATION ON THE ONE HAND THE GOVERNMENT LEGISLATURES INCREASING IT. THE OTHER HAND AS I SAW. THE ROB IS THE FRONT LINE CLINICS THAT ARE REALLY MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE INSTEAD OF THE ER. AND WE'RE TRYING TO OFFER UP A SOLUTION THAT'S INTELLIGENT. AND THERE'S NO NEED TO MAKE THIS THING WORK SO I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT EITHER SIDE BUT IT'S A LITTLE. WELL- I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR ALWAYS HAS- HE'S ALWAYS- I CRIED FOR ME PERSONALLY I THINK YOU ARE- YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE JUST KIND OF TEETERING ON THE LINE I THINK PERHAPS A YOU MAY HAVE. GONE A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THAT AND IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SO I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WONDER IF THERE'S ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO HAD ANY INPUT BEFORE WE- TAKE ABOUT. THIS CONTEST THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT ADDITIONAL CONTEXT TO BE TONIGHT I THINK YOU KNOW YOU HAVE STATED THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THESE COMMUNITY CLINICS I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING LOUD AND CLEAR FROM THIS- THIS BODY IS THAT WE'LL START TO SEE SOME MOVEMENT IN AND HOPEFULLY. SOME BETTER UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THESE COMMUNITY CLINICS AND WE'VE GOT THEM ALL BACK HOME. WRETCH THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC LIKE NO OTHER AND I KNOW I'M PREACHING TO THE CHOIR FELT THIS BUT- I FEEL FOR THEM- I REALLY DO AND THEY'RE JUST REALLY TRYING TO RECOVER AT THIS POINT- SO. DEEP CONCERN I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING ON- THAT- I WILL SUPPORT TODAY BUT- YOU KNOW WOULD LOVE TO. CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOUR SCORES ON ON- FOLKS BACK HOME THAT NEED HELP. THE ESTIMATE IS SEVENTY PERCENT- SENATOR OF THESE CLAIMS WILL BE IMPACTED BY THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY HELPING GONNA BE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. OKAY WITH THAT SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING SETTLEMENT DID YOU OF THE TESTS WE WOULD YOU CARE CLOSE. THE STATUS LOOK I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT I THINK THAT IS WE- DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES WITH HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS PRIMARY CARE IN THE COMMUNITIES THE FRONTLINE WORKERS THIS IS A CREATIVE AND IMAGINATIVE WAY. TO IMPACT THE PROCESS IS A WAY TO ACCESS FEDERAL DOLLARS I THINK IN A PRETTY CREATIVE WAY AND- TO WRITE THING TO DO ESCRIBO. ALREADY THANK YOU SO MUCH- SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE FOR WOMEN IN MOTION. OKAY WE ARE MOTION MY CENTER.

ITSELF WELCOME AND NAME'S TYLER FITZ GERALD ON THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR OF SOME OF THE STATE RECOVERY CENTER WHICH IS LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE TREATMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ADDICTION SOCIETY. OF ERICA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE CRITERIA I'VE BEEN A LICENSED MARRIAGE FAMILY THERAPIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS I HAVE FIFTEEN YEARS OF PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WORKING IN ADDICTION. AND RECOVERY SERVICES. WE ALL KNOW THE IMPACT AND DEVASTATION THAT ADDICTION CAUSES INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. THERE ISN'T A PERSON IN THIS ROOM ARE IN THIS BUILDING THAT HASN'T BEEN DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TOUCHED BY THE DEVASTATION OF ADDICTION. ADDICTION DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND IT'S NOT TREATED OVERNIGHT. WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO US FOR TREATMENT THEY HAVE MADE A LONG JOURNEY TO GET THERE. THESE ARE FUNCTIONING INDIVIDUALS IN OUR SOCIETY WHO WORK AND PAY FOR THEIR INSURANCE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A FIFTY YEAR OLD CONSUMER WHO CAME TO US LAST YEAR. WHO HAVE BEEN SUFFERIN WITH ALCOHOLISM AND BENZODIAZEPINE ADDICTION FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS IT TOOK MANY YEARS BEFORE THAT FOR THE DICTION TO GET OUT OF CONTROL. WHEN THIS PERSON CAME TO OUR TREATMENT FACILITY. THEY WERE ASSESSED BY AN ADDICTION MAX MEDICINE SPECIALIST A PSYCHIATRIST A NURSE MYSELF AND A CASE MANAGER. THIS TEAM PUTS TOGETHER THE TREATMENT PLAN FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL. WE'VE AND REPORTS THE INSURANCE COMPANY OUR FINDINGS AND OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR THEIR TREATMENT. DURING THIS FIRST PERIOD THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL SUFFERED SEVERE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS THAT ARE LIFE THREATENING. THEY'RE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TREATMENT SERVICES OTHER THAN THE MEDICAL ATTENTION THAT THEY REQUIRE TO STAY ALIVE. WE RECEIVED ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION FOR SIX DAYS TO TREAT THIS INDIVIDUALS DISEASE. AT THIS POINT THEY COULD PARTICIPATE MEANINGFULLY IN TREATMENT. IT WAS AFTER THIS AUTHORIZATION THE INSURANCE COMPANY DECIDED THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO IS. TAKING IN MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE OUNCES OF HARD ALCOHOL A DAY COULD BE TREATED ON AN OUTPATIENT BASIS RECEIVING NINE HOURS OF TREATMENT BY ZOOM AT HOME ALONE REFERRED TO A PEER TO PEER REVIEW WITH A NON INSURANCE DOCTOR IN WAS FROM A WISCONSIN COMPANY TO TALK ABOUT THIS CASE I COULD TELL BY THE TONE OF THE VOICE OF THIS DOCTOR THAT WITHIN THREE MINUTES THIS CASE WAS GOING TO BE DENIED. HOURS AND HOURS GO INTO ASSESSING THESE PEOPLE AND PROVIDING TREATMENT AND DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM THIS DOCTOR SAID WELL THEY'RE NOT SUICIDAL THEREFORE THEY DON'T NEED MORE TREATMENT. I'M SORRY BUT SUICIDE DOES NOT BELONG IN OUR FACILITY REQUIRES TREATMENT ELSEWHERE FRIEDMAN IS NOW. THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE BY DOCTORS NOT QUALIFIED NO DISRESPECT TO PODIATRIST BUT PODIATRISTS ARE MAKING DECISIONS WHETHER OR NOT THESE PEOPLE NEED ADDITIONAL TREATMENT. WE NEED TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE IN LINE WITH SENATOR WIENER'S BILL SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE PASSED LAST YEAR.

LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES IN L. FOLLOWED BUDGET HAMPTON FROM SOUTH SERVICES AND HEALTH PLANS AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE SO. PLEASE BE. MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSEPHONE. OF BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES FIRST AND FOREMOST WE LIKE TO. THINK THE CHAIR AS WELL AS YOUR STAFF. THE AUTHORS AND SPONSORS FOR THE OPEN DIALOGUE AND FORTUNATELY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT STANDS TODAY. GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS A KEY COMPONENT TO A PERSON'S OVERALL WELL BEING. AND HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDERS MAKE REMAIN STEADFAST IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE SAFE EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE ON PAR WITH MEDICAL SURGICAL CARE. I BELIEVE THERE IS MORE THAT WE MUST DO. TO MEET THE EVER INCREASING TREATMENT NEEDS OF THOSE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND REMAIN RESOLUTE IN OUR COMMITMENT. UNFORTUNATELY WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE OVER ARCHING. CLEVENGER ROWLEY'S ENSURED. MEDICALLY NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE BELIEVE. SB NINE NINE NINE MISSES THE MARK AND INSTEAD SET THE PLACE THE COMPLEX AND OVERLY BURDENSOME UTILIZATION REVIEW PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY SB NINE NINE NINE SETS IN PLACE AND- A NEW PROCESS WHICH WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT WHO IS ALLOWED TO CONDUCT UTILIZATION REVIEWS WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING QUALIFIED POSITIONS AND SPECIALISTS PERFORM THESE REVIEWS. CLOSELY FOLLOW THE CURRENT GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE. UNCLEAR WHAT THE SHORTFALL THIS CHANGES INTENDING TO ADDRESS. THE THING LAW CLEARLY SPECIFIES THAT NO INDIVIDUAL OTHER THAN A LICENSED PHYSICIAN OR LICENSED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL. WHO IS COMPETENT. ARE YOU WITH THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN. SERVICES REQUESTED ME DIDN'T HIRE MODIFIER REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION. FURTHERMORE WITH RESPECT MAY HELP SUCH. STREET S. B. EIGHT FIVE FIVE REGULATIONS ISSUED MOST RECENTLY THAT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. PUT IT. I'M READING. DIFFICULT TO THE CHIN- ONE THE N. ROLLED. CAN HAS TO BE AND- IS THE ISSUE A LIST OF CRIED AND GUIDELINES THAT WERE VIEWED AS SUMMARY OF ANY REASONS FOR DEVIATING FROM THOSE CRITERIA AND A SUMMARY OF THE PLANS CLINICAL REASONS FOR THE DECISION. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO REQUIRED THE PLANS TO HAVE A VERY ROBUST I'M TRAINING PROCESS IN PLACE AND THOSE ARE ALSO OUTLINED IN THE MOST RECENT REGULATIONS THAT WERE ISSUED. UNDERSTANDING THESE REQUIREMENTS IT QUESTIONS WHY THEY DIDN'T LIVING LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY AS IT WILL SEEMINGLY BRING NO ADDITIONAL VALUE TO THE PROCESS BUT WILL CERTAINLY ADD COSTS. SECONDLY WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE SECTION CARE THREE WHICH REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PERFORMING UTILIZATION REVIEW TO DISCLOSE THE PERCENTAGE OF THE SERVICES APPROVED AND DENIED BY THE PROVIDER OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IT'S AGAIN UNCLEAR FOR IT TO US WHAT VALUE THAT WOULD BRING TO EITHER THE PROVIDER OR THE PATIENT UNDERSTANDINGIT BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERN. FOR CONCERNS ABOUT THAT CREATING A PREJUDICIAL SORT OF EXPERIENCE AND MAR THE PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE TO BELIEVE THAT UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT IS INTENDED TO BE PUNITIVE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS UNFORTUNATELY REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS OF IT DOES MEAN FOR TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NOW BRING UP BUDGET HAMPTON FROM THE GULF ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS YOU HAVE A MINUTE AND SIX SECONDS- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEFF HAMPTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS- IN INTEREST OF TIME I WILL ALIGN.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO THE TWICE EARLIER BUT I KNOW YOU WERE HERE THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU TO SIGN IT- AND THEN AGAIN YOU FOR WORKING WITH US MCCUE COMMITTEE STEP ON THAT. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBER. MELENDEZ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- IS SO SENATOR CORTESE. D. OPPONENTS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. DISCLOSURES THAT WILL CREATE A TEDIOUS AND PREJUDICIAL DISCLOSURE PROCESS THAT WILL LEAVE THE PATIENT. WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO BE PUNITIVE- WHICH IT IS NOT WHICH WOULD CREATE A- TYPE OF HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT THAT HARMS THE SYSTEM AND INEVITABLY MARS THE PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE THAT'S- PER MY- AND ALICE. CARE TO COMMENT ON THAT. HELLO WOOD. I DON'T THINK THE BILL DOESN'T IN ANY WAY SHAPE PERFORM IT SIMPLY BILLS- ON THE EFFORT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN PURPORTED TOPPED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO SPEAK FIFTY FIVE. BY SAYING- BY PREVENTING. REVIEWERS WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT SPECIFIC DIAGNOSES FROM THE PERSON. APPROPRIATE KOMPLETT DECISIONS MADE BY PROVIDERS. IN ITS I THINK IT'S HARD TO BE AGAINST THAT. I THINK IT'S HARD TO BE AGAINST. PREVENTING REVIEWERS WERE UNALTERABLE. ABOUT SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS IN THIS CASE AROUND ADDICTION. SUBSTANCE ABUSE. FROM REVERSING. DECISIONS COMPANY DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE BY PROVIDERS. CARS IT HERE. THE URGENT AND URGENT RESPONSE TO REQUESTS FOR COVERAGE AN APPEALS AGAIN I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE OBJECTION WOULD BE TO THE- THINK IS REGULATORS AND ABILITY TO REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY. WE'RE INDUCING HIGH DENIAL RATES MAY BE IN PLAY- I THINK THOSE ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. OKAY ADDITIONS TO THE GREAT WORK THAT SB FIFTY FIVE STARTED. OKAY I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WONDER IF- MISS WATKINS COULD COME FORWARD PLEASE AND ADDRESS. MY CONCERNS SINCE YOU WERE IN THE OPPOSITION. AND IF YOU COULD PERHAPS BE GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE EXPLANATION AS TO- IN THIS DISCLOSURE WHAT WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO KAY IN THE BILL REQUIRES- EACH IN A GROUP THAT EACH REVIEWER TO INCLUDE THE PERCENTAGES- APPROVALS OR DENIALS F ANY REVIEW AND THAT GOES TO BOTH THE PATIENT AND TO THE PROVIDER AND OUR QUESTIONS SORT OF HIS AROUND WHAT VALUE DOES THAT BRING I MEAN WHILE SOME OF OUR PLANS DO IN HOUSE REVIEW. OTHERS ESPECIALLY RELATED TO VERY SPECIALTY SORT OF DESIGNATIONS DO OUTSIDE REVIEWS SO YOU COULD HAVE A COMPANY THAT WE CONTRACT WITH THAT DOES UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT THAT DOES IT FOR MULTIPLE BUSINESSES MULTIPLE COMPANIES ACROSS THE NATION. SO WERE KIND OF QUESTIONING. THERE'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION. THERE'S HAVING OUT AT ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION IF IT PROVIDES PROVIDED BY YOU OR A REVIEW BY THEREGULATOR BUT FOR A PROVIDER TO JESSE THAT. AND DENIALS THE MODIFICATIONS ARE OBVIOUSLY. THERE OFTENTIMES VERY COMPLICATED- SOMETIMES THERE'S A MODIFICATION BECAUSE THE DOSAGE THAT'S PRESCRIBED WE WANT THREE STEP THERAPY WE WANT YOU TO TRY AND FAIL ON A LOWER DOSAGE THAT WE BELIEVE IS MORE SAFER EFFICACY. REASONS SO THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES INTO THIS DETERMINATION SO JUST TO SEE A NUMBER WITH EXPLAINING NO I UNDERSTAND. HOW MANY DID I OPEN APPROVALS WE BELIEVE CREATES THIS KIND OF. HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT TO SUGGESTS THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THAT WERE WERE AN EIGHT FIVE FIVE IS DONE A LOT THE REGULATIONS ARE IN PROCESS. I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE ALL MOVED TO A NONPROFIT CLINICAL CARE GUIDELINES WHICH I THINK THIS BILL SORT OF TRIES TO GET OUT. SO I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE'RE LOOKING TO THAT PROCESS TO LEND TOWARDS ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE THERE'S AN INTER RATER RELIABILITY FACTOR OF 90% FOR THE PLANS WHICH MEANS THAT THE NINE THAT THE PLAN HAS TO BE RIGHT NOW. PERCENT OF TIME MEAN THAT'S IN. HIGH PRESSURE. AND DOESN'T ALLOW FOR A LOT OF. WRITER WRONG AND SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THAT IS TO HOLD THE STANDARD FOR US. NOT OBSCURE NUMBERS THAT MIGHT NOT REALLY BRING ANY VALUE. OKAY SO THEN- I JUST NEED TO KNOW THE STATEMENT THAT. OPPONENTS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DISCLOSURES AND THAT IT WOULD CREATE A TEDIOUS AND PREJUDICIAL DISCLOSURE PROCESS LEAVING THE PATIENT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF PUNITIVE EFFORT IT. SO YOU SEE YOU STAND BY THAT OPINION. THAT THE PATIENT WOULD FEEL THAT IT WELL THE QUESTION IS IF YOU GUYS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW DOES THE PATIENT YOU KNOW. HOW ARE THEY EVEN AWARE OF THIS AND HOW WITH THE PAY. THE DEBTS PUNITIVE THAT BOOK AS THE BILL REQUIRES EVERY- REVIEWER TO INCLUDE WITHIN THEIR DENIAL OR MODIFICATION TO BOTH THE PROVIDER AND THE PATIENT. ASSISTANCE TO CALL NUMBER A PERCENTAGE OF APPROVALS OR DENIALS FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF THEIR REVIEWS RIGHT BUT AS A PATIENT. LOOKING AT THAT BIG THEY RECEIVE IT SO OUR OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE PATIENTS GOING TO SEE IT AND MAYBE THEY SAY TO USE THE NUMBER- A REVIEWER SAY OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS DONE A HUNDRED REVIEWS. AND THERE'S SPEND 70% WHERE THERE'S BEEN A DIALER MODIFICATION AND 30% OF PATIENTS GOING TO LOOK AT THAT AND ASSUME. THAT THERE IS SOME REASON FOR WHICH THERE IS A PUNITIVE EXPECTATION OF WHY THEY'RE BEING DENIED WHAT MAY JUST BE. THAT REVIEWERS NUMBERS DON'T TELL YOU THE BOTH VERY AND- THE QUESTION FOR US IS IF IT DOESN'T BRING VALUE. IT'S I MEAN THIS IS EVER WE CONTRACT WITH FOR UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT STORE THEY REPORTING ON ALL THE NUMBERS ACROSS ALL BUSINESS LINES OR JUST FOR. AN ANTHEM OR AN ACT NOW UNITED THOSE CHAINS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS BECAUSE REVIEWS I MEAN THEY'RE CONSTANTLY DOING REVIEWS SO. THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND WORK THAT GOES INTO THAT AND THE QUESTION IS. DOES IT BRING VALUE TO THE PATIENT OR DOES IT SIMPLY MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT I'M JUST BEING DENIED OKAY THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE. WHAT IS THE REASON THAT THOSE NUMBERS WOULD BE PROVIDED TO A PATIENT. BECAUSE THE WAY THINGS GO IN IN THIS IS THAT THE PLEA FOR TRANSPARENCY IS. SOMEBODY NEEDS TREATMENT AND I HEARD THE TESTIMONY FOCUSING ON- BUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT THE PERSON NEEDS TREATMENT. PERSON NEEDS A PROGRAM THAT'S AKIN TO A TWELVE STEP PROGRAM THEY NEED INPATIENT I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE REASON FOR. THE NIGHTTIME BRIDGE. IN THE NEXT PATIENTS DENIED COVERAGE IN THE NEXT SESSION IS DENIED COVERAGE IN NONE OF THAT INFORMATION IN AGGREGATE IS PROVIDED- IN IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC SCRUTINY. IN THE US WERE ASKING HER FOR BECAUSE- IF IT'S NOT TRUE IF IT'S NOT TRUE THAT THAT'S THE TREND THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE SHOW ACTUALLY BRING VALIDATION AND VALUE TO. THE TO THE IN A TO THE INSURED INDUSTRY ITSELF BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE- IT'LL TELL YOU- I HAVE BEEN. INVOLVED I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT THE WITNESS OF MY OWN BILL BUT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN RECOVERY PROGRAMS FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS SIX MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS AND I WILL TELL YOU- THAT THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE BEING DENIED AND DENIED AND DENIED AND DENIED. FORGET FOR BASS. BUT LIKE THE WITNESS WHO DID SHOW UP TODAY WHO SO FAR HAS BEEN DENIED FOR A TWENTY EIGHT DAY TREATMENT INPATIENT TREATMENT- OF IS THE ALMOST ENDEMIC IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST SIMPLY TRYING O GET TO THAT PROBLEM IF IT IF IT DOESN'T EXIST THIS BILL WILL CREATE ANY PROBLEMS FOR THE INDUSTRY IF IT DOES EXIST THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE OKAY SO. LET ME PUT A FINER POINT ON IT FOR YOU IF YOU ARE THE PATIENT IN YOU GET THE PAPERWORK THAT SAYS THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY YOU KNOW THAT THE PERCENTAGES ARE SEVENTY THIRTY AS FAR AS APPROVAL AND- OKAY SPEND WHAT. FOR YOU IS A PATIENT WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WHAT IS THE GOAL. FOR WHAT THE PATIENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION I'M TRYING TO SEE THE NEXUS HERE WHY A PATIENT WOULD NEED THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION CAN BE TRACKED. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW FORMULATED AND PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT EXTRA WORK ON THEIR PART. SIR CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY THE PATIENT PROVIDER GOING TO WANT INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THE DENIAL AND WITH GREAT TO KNOW. IS GENERALLY- PREJUDICIAL TO PATIENTS SO THAT IT THAT ARE ARE SEEKING- VETERAN THAT UTILIZATION REVIEW PROCESS. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS A SPEECH EIGHT FIFTY FIVE CALLS FOR PARITY. IN AND I THINK WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED PARITY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE. NO SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE IS BEING BUILT UPON HERE BY CALLING FOR THE TRANSPARENCY THIS REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE IS IT HERE TOO OKAY BUT I'M JUST. FROM A VERY BASIC LEVEL HERE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AGAIN YOU AS A PATIENT YOU GET THAT PIECE OF PAPER AND YOU SEE THE NUMBERS. AND YOU DON'T LIKE THEM. THEN WHAT. IT IS THE COURSE OF ACTION FOR THE PATIENT. WHAT WOULD BE THE EXPECTATION HOW DOES THAT HELP YOU AS A PATIENT OTHER THAN KNOWING THE NUMBERS SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE NUMBERS THAN WHAT OR NOT IT'S GOING TO HELP THE NEXT PATIENT THE NEXT PIECE IN THE NEXT PATIENT BECAUSE- THE INSURER IS GOING TO BE. CALLED OUT FOR. OF FOR VIOLATING THE PROVISIONS OF THE AYE HILL FIVE WHO'S GOING TO CALL THE PROVIDER UP. IS THIS. IS THIS IS- S. FIFTY FIVE ADDRESSES WITH REPERCUSSIONS ARE FOR NOT PROVIDING PARITY. OKAY. I'M STILL NOT QUITE SEEING HOW. NOT THAT I'M OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW THE TRANSPARENCY THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M GETTING I'M JUST I'M STILL NOT QUITE SEEING HOW THAT HELPS THE PATIENT BUT- IT WAS HELPFUL TO HEAR- YOUR EXPLANATION AND TO HEAR THE OPPOSITION WE AND THANK YOU AND I. THINK THE TRAUMA TO THE PATIENT COMES FROM WITHIN NOT WITHOUT EXPLORATION. FROM BEING OUT ON THE STREET. A WITH AN ADDICTION PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT THAT THEY WERE SEEKING I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE TRAUMA COMES. TO HEAR THAT THE TRAUMAS GOING TO COME FROM LEARNING WHY THEY WERE DENIED. I THINK IT'S A LITTLE ABSURD BUT- I RESPECT. HIS OPINION ON THIS YEAR NO AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOUR POINT THAT THE TRAUMA DOES COME FROM. NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THE TREATMENT NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS BUT I WANT HIM. YOU KNOW I DO WANT SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. CONCERNING CARE WITH HOW WE ARE- YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTING CERTAIN REGULATIONS AND MANDATES TO IN ORDER TO GET THESE POLICIES IN PLACE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM EMBERS. CASEY NINE CIRCLE TASTY I THINK AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF- CERTAINLY- APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS IMPLEMENTING- FIFTY FIVE- AND- BUT- I GUESS FOR ME I ASK EVERY QUESTION- SO WHAT WE NEED NOW IS IT IF YOU WANT OPTIONS FOR SOMEONE WHO RECEIVES IT AND NOW FROM THEIR HEALTH INSURER IS THAT- THEY COULD ACTUALLY GO IN APPEAL TO FINANCE HEALTHCARE. GREAT AND SO SOMEONE GETS THE NILE AND- CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR THEM TO KNOW WHY- BUT- IF- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS MAYBE IS THAT OKAY WELL IF THEY LOOK AT IT IS IF THEY FOUND OUT THE REVIEWER HAD A SEVENTY THIRTY APPROVAL. VERSUS A THIRTY SEVENTY. APPROVAL ORDER DENYING SEVENTY PERCENT- MAYBE THAT MIGHT INFORM THEM AS TO WHETHER THEY WANT TO PURSUE. A- APPEAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE DO YOU THINK THAT THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE I MEAN IT'S NOT REALLY A GREAT MEASURE FOR THAT BUT DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT. THAT MIGHT BE SOMEONE FORMATIVE IN TERMS OF NEXT STEPS FOR A PROVIDER AND THEIR PATIENTS I DO THINK THAT SUCKS WHO YOU KNOW- WELL ARTICULATED EXPLANATION OF WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN A SHOULD THAT BE THE CASE IN YOUR BILL. DESPITE MY- MY OWN ADMITTED BIAS TOWARD WHAT I BELIEVE ARE EXCESSIVE DENIALS- I PITCH THAT IN MY PRESENTATION JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO OF THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. THAT TRANSPARENCY CAN WORK WELL- FOR BOTH SIDES YOU KNOW FOR FOLKS. THAT MIGHT NEED TO USE THAT INFORMATION AS PART OF AN APPEAL AND EXCESSIVE DENIAL RATE- BASED ON THE UTILIZATION REVIEW INFORMATION THEY'VE RECEIVED JUST LIKE YOU JUST JUST INDICATED- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF IT'S FAVORABLE TOWARD. OF THE INSURER THAT THAT THEY WOULD USE IT TO DEFEND THE APPEAL SO I THINK IT'S FAIR. ALL RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN WE KNOW THAT'S NOT PERFECT MEASURE AND SO FORTH AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION SURE THAT AGAIN APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THEF. AND AMENDMENTS AND I THINK A PLAGUE THAT STUDENTS DOES LISA DRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT COME UP. AS WELL- AND- SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- TODAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I DON'T THINK YOU AND I WOULD SEE EVERYBODY WHO'S HAD INPUT SO FAR INCLUDING THE OPPOSITION INCLUDING PER OPPOSITION- HAS IMPROVED THE BILL MADE A BETTER BILL WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK OUT THE KIND OF. THE KIND OF FEEDBACK WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OKAY THANK YOU- ACTUALIZAR MOTION YET OKAY IT'S MOVE I CENTER LEYVA. THAT SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SECONDED BY CENTER LEYVA. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HI. I MELINDA. EGGMAN EGGMAN AIKEN SALAS. GROVE HER TADO HER TITLE BY LEYVA LEYVA AYE LIMÓN ROSS FIVE ROTH AYE RUBIO WIENER CERTAINLY FIVE ZERO HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY CENTER EGGMAN ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN SB 1416% OR EGGMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I WILL ADJUST MY WITNESSES BECAUSE YES WHEN WAS ONLY BE ABLE TO FIVE THIRTY SO- BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR HEARING THIS BILL THIS AFTERNOON AND FOR ME AND MY STAFF AS WE CONTINUE TO DRILL DOWN ON THIS ISSUE- I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS I PRESENTED. FIELD TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM BOTTLENECKS TO IMPROVE LPS DATA PREVENT UNNECESSARY CONSERVATORSHIP STE AND IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS- HOW PROPOSALS INTENDED TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OUTCOME AND TO IMPROVE REGIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING. PERHAPS SOME. THIS BILL. IN A IN A VACUUM IS HAPPENING AS WE ARE FOLLOWING IN HIS STORE BUDGET IN IN BEHAVIORAL INTO AND HOUSING. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY ALL OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE AND ALL OUR COLLEAGUES NOT ON THIS COMMITTEE PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ALL RECOGNIZING THAT WE MISSED FORCING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS A CRISIS THAT HAS ONLY BEEN EXASPERATED BY TWO YEARS PLUS. OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. LAST DECEMBER I JOINED WITH ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES TO DISCUSS THE RECENT AUDIT OF OUR LPS SYSTEM THERE WERE A LOT OF GOOD AND PRODUCTIVE IDEAS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT HEARING. TWO MAJOR THINGS. THAT WE TOOK AWAY OR THE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT OURS OUR SYSTEM IS WORKING- DESPITE THE ORDERS FINDING THERE ALSO APPEARS TO BE A VARIATION FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND HOW DANGEROUS THIS AND GREAT DISABILITY ARE INTERPRETED. AND AGAIN YOU HEARD A COUPLE WEEKS AGO- THE BILL ADDRESSING THE LACK OF DATA- THAT THAT THAT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. AND NOW THIS BILL TACKLES THAT AS A PART OF IT WHEN CARE IS NOT AVAILABLE PEOPLE ARE OFTEN LOCKED UP. SENT TO JAIL. LEFT TO LANGUISH AND OR THEY DIE. WHICH GETS TO THE POINT OF THIS BILL WE DON'T WANT MORE PEOPLE TO BE TREATED INVOLUNTARILY HAVE FLIES IN THE FACE OF ALL THE OTHER WORK INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE DOING. BUT THE REALITY IS PEOPLE ARE D. COMPENSATING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES. FIFTY FOUR SIXTEEN AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. WOULD ALLOW FOR INVOLUNTARY CARE WITH ALL OF THE EXISTING DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS IF SOMEONE IS SO MENTALLY ILL THAT THEY CANNOT PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN MEDICAL CARE TO THE POINT THAT THEY ARE AT RISK OF. SUBSTANTIAL BODILY HARM. DANGEROUS DANGEROUS WORSENING OF ANY RELATED SERIOUS PHYSICAL ILLNESS. OR SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC DETERIORATION. WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT TO PROVIDE THAT TO PEOPLE IS THE BIGGER QUESTION. THE OPS SYSTEM HAS SIGNIFICANT GUARD RAILS AS WELL AND IS NOT INTENDED AS A TOOL TO TARGET PEOPLE IN POVERTY THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO PREVENT THAT BACKGROUND PAPER- IF YOU'D LIKE TO IN THE NOTE THAT PEOPLE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR BASIC NEEDS AS A RESULT OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM THEREFORE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR FOOD INSECURITY DOES NOT MEET ANY. OF THIS CRITERIA. I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS IN OUR COUNTRY BUT WE ARE WALKING A LINE WITH FREEDOM TO MAKE DECISIONS WHETHER A PERSON HAS CAPACITY OR NOT. IS DENYING PEOPLE THEIR HEALTH THEIR DIGNITY AND IN SOME CASES THEIR LIVES. I WANT TO BE CLEAR INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT HAS SHOULD ALWAYS BE A LAST RESORT. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THIS BILL THAT BUMPS INAPPROPRIATE INVOLUNTARY CARE SOONER INTO THE CONTINUUM. RESHOOT THAT BY HAVE FILLED SOME PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENTS WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION ON THIS. BUT I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THEY HAVE. YES MORE VOLUNTARY CARE BETTER OUTCOMES. YES MORE FUNDING AND MORE HOUSING. YES TO BETTER DATA AND BETTER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN SYSTEMS. BUT ALSO YES TO ENSURING. WHEN WE CAN PROVIDE CARE AS A LAST RESORT WHEN SOMEONE'S MENTAL ILLNESS PREVENTS THEM FROM PROVIDING FOR THEIR OWN MEDICAL CARE. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS SEEN DIEGO MAYOR TODD GLORIA. AND RANDALL FROM THE PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. THANKS VERY MUCH- SO THIS IS THE ONLY WITNESS AT THIS POINT TIME. I THINK THERE DOES TO RENTAL AND IN PARTICULAR OKAY GLORIA SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AS A MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR WITNESSES SUPPORT SO WE CAN BEGIN WITH THE HONORABLE TODD GLORIA MAYOR OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO- GOOD EVENING.

AND THIS YEAR WE HAVE DECIDED TO JOIN CENTER ADMINS AND SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S LEADING ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. TO WEIGH IN IN SUPPORT OF REFORMING CALIFORNIA'S OUTDATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WE DID SO BECAUSE WE SEE IN OUR CITIES WHAT ALL OF YOU SEE IN YOUR DISTRICTS. PEOPLE CYCLING TO HOSPITALS JAILS IN THE STREETS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE. IT'S TIME THAT WE FACE THE PAINFUL BUT OBVIOUS TRUTH. THEIR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS BROKEN AND WE MUST FIX IT. LAST YEAR IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OUR PARAMEDICS FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS SPENT NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED SERVICE HOURS. EACH DAY RESPONDING TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCY CALLS FOR PEOPLE IN CRISIS. THANK CENTER ADMIN FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE WITH A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO HELP MODERNIZE OUR BOOKING BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM. LIKE THE SENATOR I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE CAN BE A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE. AND I PERSONALLY DO NOT TAKE ISSUE THE CIVIL LIBERTY LIGHTLY NOR DO ANY OF MY MALE COLLEAGUES. BUT THIS IS A ISSUE. MOUNTAIN MORAL IMPORTANCE SAID LIKE TO LEADERS THE PUBLIC EXPECTS MORE FROM US. THAN PUTTING ACTION OFF LEADER AND LEADING THE STATUS QUO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE WERE SEEN RESULTS. I RECOGNIZE THE ISSUE THIS ISSUE REQUIRES FOR FACILITIES AND SERVICES IN THE BUDGET TO FUND THEM. AS WE TACKLE THOSE CHALLENGES TO. SIXTEEN COMMENTS IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED THAT WOULD MODERNIZE CONSERVE FOR THE MOST NEED THIS BILL AS YOU KNOW WE MODERNIZE MEDICAL HIS WILL MEDICAL TO BE CONSIDERED A DEGREE SAY DEAF AND OF STANDARD BY WHICH MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THERE SHOULD BE A DUTY TO INTERVENE TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES THIS MISTER CHAIRMAN AT THE TIME FOR ACTION ON THIS LONG OVERDUE ITEMS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT SO INTO DOLLARS AT SYSTEM THAT IS NOT HELPING THE PEOPLE ARE ST I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL AND SAYS SENATE BILL FOURTEEN SIXTEEN I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING PEOPLE TO TIME HOW DID THAT SERVICES THAT THEY NEED.

RECRUITING BIPOLAR AND SEVERE DEPRESSION WHICH CAN ALSO- PRESENTS WITH PSYCHOTIC FEATURES THERE IS. DELUSIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS ARE THE HALLMARKS OF PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS BUT THAT'S ALSO THE SERVICES OF THE FRONTAL LOBE WHICH MEANS THAT TOGETHER WITH PSYCHOSIS THE PRECOGS VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH DECISION MAKERS THAT CAN BE SERIOUS DETRIMENT. TO THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. YOU KNOW A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A PSYCHOTIC INDIVIDUAL WHO ALSO USES MATH.

GOES AGAINST THAT IT VASTLY EXPANDS THE DEFINITION AND SUBJECTS INDIVIDUALS TO RISKING THEIR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND FOR THAT REASON WE OPPOSE IT AGREE WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT THE STATE ORDER NOT RECOMMENDED EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF RAPE WE DISABLED. THAT WAS NOT THE STATE AUDITOR'S CONCLUSION AND WE AGREE WITH THAT CONCLUSION THE ISSUE WAS SERVICES AND- BE WORKING AT. EMPHASIZE INCREASE SERVICES TO PREVENT HOSPITALIZATION OR CONSERVATORSHIP AND THAT WAS THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION.
