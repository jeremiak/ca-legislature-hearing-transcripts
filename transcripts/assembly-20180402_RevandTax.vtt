00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:04.870 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE

00:25:04.203 --> 00:25:08.540 region:rollup2
DUCTWORK.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.941 region:rollup2

ON THE BILL THANK YOU.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:17.082 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IT WHAT BOTHERS ME IS

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:19.752 region:rollup2
HOW FROM A SIMPLE ERROR LIKE

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:21.487 region:rollup2
YEAH EXPIRATION OF A CREDIT CARD

00:25:19.752 --> 00:25:24.056 region:rollup2
YOU MISS THE NOTIFICATION.

00:25:21.487 --> 00:25:26.225 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN END UP FINDING YOU

00:25:24.056 --> 00:25:27.960 region:rollup2
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

00:25:26.225 --> 00:25:29.795 region:rollup2
I THINK MAYBE THAT'S THE BASIS

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.398 region:rollup2
OF THE PROBLEM.

00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:34.233 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT SOME POINT WE

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:34.633 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO BE ADDRESSING THAT I

00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:36.368 region:rollup2
MEAN THESE THESE.

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:38.570 region:rollup2
.

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:40.105 region:rollup2
THAT JUST SEEMS EXCESSIVE.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.373 region:rollup2
I WOULD AGREE AND I THINK THAT

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:43.409 region:rollup2
OF VERY OFTEN.

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:44.510 region:rollup2
TOLL ROADS AND TOLL BRIDGES ARE

00:25:43.409 --> 00:25:45.811 region:rollup2
THE WAY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.946 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:50.049 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE GET

00:25:47.946 --> 00:25:52.284 region:rollup2
A SITUATION WHERE SOMETHING LIKE

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:53.819 region:rollup2
THIS GETS OUT OF CONTROL. AND

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:55.521 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFICS OF THIS BILL.

00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:57.289 region:rollup2
AT LEAST THE WAGE GARNISHMENT

00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:58.724 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK IS THE MOST

00:25:57.289 --> 00:26:00.225 region:rollup2
INTRUSIVE WAY TO BE ABLE YEAH.

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:00.526 region:rollup2
SO ANYWAY YES I'LL BE VOTING FOR

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:02.561 region:rollup2

A BILL NEXT YEAR. THAT GOES TO

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:17.543 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION OF WHY THESE

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:20.245 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE

00:26:17.543 --> 00:26:22.581 region:rollup2

LOOKING TO DO HERE WAS

00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:04.423 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE INVOLVEMENT OF

THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND THE

00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:07.726 region:rollup2
LOW WAGE GARNISHMENT DIE ASPECT

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:09.895 region:rollup2

QUITE POSSIBLY AMONG THE MOST

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:16.768 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING WAYS TO BE ABLE TO

00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:05.382 region:rollup2

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:07.117 region:rollup2

00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:08.952 region:rollup2
YOU BET AND YOU PAID A THOUSAND

00:58:07.117 --> 00:58:10.620 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN DUES YOU'RE GETTING

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:12.689 region:rollup2
TWENTY DOLLARS BACK.

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.491 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE MAKING THREE HUNDRED

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:17.094 region:rollup2
THOUSAND A YEAR.

00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:18.929 region:rollup2
AND YOU SUBTRACT FROM THE INCOME

00:58:17.094 --> 00:58:21.431 region:rollup2
YOU GET TWELVE PERCENT BACK.

00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:22.632 region:rollup2
OR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:23.967 region:rollup2
SO THAT MEANS A LOW INCOME

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:26.336 region:rollup2
PERSON IS GETTING THE TWENTY

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:26.870 region:rollup2

FINE.

00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:35.912 region:rollup2
THEN YOU'RE GIVING EVERYBODY

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:38.648 region:rollup2
THE SAME AMOUNT BUT IT WHEN IT'S

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:40.617 region:rollup2
IT DEDUCTION FROM INCOME. COULD

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:43.453 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT YOU GET DEPENDS UPON

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:45.489 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PERCENT YOU'RE PAYING

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:46.790 region:rollup2
IN TAXES IS AND THAT'S JUST MUCH

00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:48.959 region:rollup2
HIGHER FOR HIGH INCOME

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:51.094 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

00:58:48.959 --> 00:58:53.530 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A PROGRESSIVE TAX.

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:54.431 region:rollup2
AS WE SHOULD AND YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:56.600 region:rollup2

00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:58.168 region:rollup2
PROGRESSIVE BY GIVING PEOPLE

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.770 region:rollup2
BREAKS TO OF HIGH INCOME SO YOUR

00:58:58.168 --> 00:59:00.404 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT IS BETTER TO KEEP THE

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:02.472 region:rollup2
TWENTY DOLLARS AND GOVERNMENT'S

00:59:00.404 --> 00:59:04.408 region:rollup2

00:59:12.783 --> 00:59:16.520 region:rollup2
I COULD SUPPORT A TAX CREDIT

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:18.055 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEN EVERYBODY COULD

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.589 region:rollup2
PRESUMABLY GET THE SAME AMOUNT.

00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:21.124 region:rollup2
