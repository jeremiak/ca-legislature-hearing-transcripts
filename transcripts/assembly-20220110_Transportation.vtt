YOU HIT ON THE NAIL THIS IS PART

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:54.158
OF THIS IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA

TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION- IS

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:58.228

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.505
COULD EXCEED THOUSANDS PREDICT

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:10.607
AND WE HEARD VERY EARLY IN IN

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:12.109
THE FIRST WITNESS SPEAK ABOUT

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:14.845
THE CHP TOWING STORAGES. ARE

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:16.413

ABOUT NINETY THREE. DOLLARS PER

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.485
DAY SO THERE'S A DISCREPANCY NOT

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.087
NOT THOUSAND ISN'T THE AVERAGE

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:24.521
FOR SURE- BUT IT'S ONE EXAMPLE

00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:26.990
OF- EXCEEDINGLY HIGH COST- WE

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:28.358
ALSO HEARD EXAMPLES OF ABOUT TWO

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:30.327
HUNDRED. NINETY PER DAY BUT BUT

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:32.362
THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS SAY-

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:34.031
LET'S SET A STANDARD BUT THERE'S

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:35.933
ALSO A PLACE. WHERE CONSUMERS

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:38.936

MAY BE AT HAND WHERE THEY CAN

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.377
GO. AND FIND RESOLUTION OF IT

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.113
THE BOARD MAY DECIDE SO THE

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:50.948
COMMISSION WE DECIDE- THE

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:52.082
CUSTOMER'S NOT RIGHT BUT THEY

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:54.017
MAY DECIDE THAT THEY ARE RIGHT

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.219
IN. YOU COULD YOU HAVE A PLACE

00:45:55.285 --> 00:46:00.157

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.825

WE WILL NOW MOVE TO A MEMBER

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:08.165
O'DONNELL. YES SIR THANK YOU

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:09.066
MUST CHAIR I JUST WANT TO WEIGH

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:12.302
IN ON THIS ISSUE- I THINK I'M

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:13.570
GOING TO BE VOTING FOR THIS BUT

00:46:13.637 --> 00:46:14.471
I'M VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:16.306
BILL VERY CAUTIOUS. I DROVE A

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:18.075
TOW TRUCK FOR FIVE YEARS AND I

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.643
THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.512
UNDERSTAND. IS IT COSTS A LOT OF

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:24.047
MONEY TO OPERATE A TOW TRUCK IT

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:26.783
COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO STORE

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:27.551
VEHICLES. K. THREE VEHICLES

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:29.419
PROBABLY MAKE UP A SMALL IN A

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:31.255
STUDIO APARTMENT. THINK WHAT

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.157
THAT'S GONNA COST JUST YOU KNOW

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.158
THE SIZE OF THAT THE SPACE OF

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:36.793
THAT VERSUS A THE SPACE OF YOUR

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.629
STORY THREE VEHICLES TAKES A LOT

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:41.131
OF MONEY IT CAN'T BE FREE OR WE

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:43.400
WILL NOT HAVE TOW TRUCKS ON THE

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.234
ROAD. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:47.204
IT FREE OKAY SO MY FEAR IS THAT

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.872
WE MAY BE STACKED THE BOARD WITH

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:50.541
FOLKS WHO WANT TO MAKE IT FREE

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:52.142
AND WE END UP NO TOW TRUCKS WE

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:54.044
END UP WITH NO SERVICE ON THE

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.079
ROAD. PEOPLE LINE UP IN A BAD

00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:57.181
SPOT SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED

00:46:57.247 --> 00:46:59.116
ABOUT WHERE THIS IS GOING I'M

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:00.250
GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. BUT

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:02.352
AGAIN I CANNOT UNDERSCORE ENOUGH

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:03.620
THE FACT THAT TOWING OF VEHICLES

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:05.155
EXPENSIVE A LIGHT DUTY TOW TRUCK

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.925
TODAY IS ABOUT A HUNDRED TEN

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:08.992
THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT FOR ONE.

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:11.328
DAY THE INSURANCE ON THAT IS

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:13.697
ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.432
THEN YOU HAVE WORKMAN'S COMP. ON

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:18.635
TOP OF THAT- VEHICLE INSURANCE

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:21.271
ON TOP OF THAT EMPLOYEE COSTS ON

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.307
TOP OF THAT FUEL TIRES

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:25.475
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES ALONG

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:28.178
WITH OPERATING A VEHICLE OF THAT

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:29.613
SORT AND IT TAKES MONEY. IT

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.417
pSURE THAT. AS WE MOVE FOR THE

00:47:33.483 --> 00:47:35.219
REPRESENTATION ON THIS BOARD IS

00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:37.120
WISE AND THOUGHTFUL TO SMALL

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:38.989
BUSINESS. AND THE FACT THAT WE

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:41.058
ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:43.460
TOW TRUCKS AND VEHICLE STORAGE

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:46.463
OUT THERE. AGAIN AND AGAIN.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.932
TODOROKI EXPENSIVE STORING

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:50.867
VEHICLES AS EXPENSIVE AS WELL

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:52.302
BECAUSE YOU AGAIN YOU HAVE TO

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.870
HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT KIND OF

00:47:53.937 --> 00:47:55.305
ACCESS TO THE VEHICLE TWENTY

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:56.139
FOUR HOUR SHOULD SOMEONE CALL

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:57.774
TWO IN THE MORNING WANNA GET

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.142
THAT VEHICLE THEY HAVE TO BE

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:00.911
ABLE TO GET THAT VEHICLE THERE'S

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:01.578
INSURANCE ASSOCIATED STORY THAT

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:03.614
VEHICLE WELL. THEIR SECURITY

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:08.118
ASSOCIATES DURING THAT. SO IT'S

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:09.586
NOT CHEAP ON EITHER FRONT. TO

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:10.854
OPERATE UNTIL TRUCK OR TO SEE-

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:12.589
VEHICLES I JUST HOPE PEOPLE

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.391
REALLY KEEP THAT IN MIND. AND IF

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:15.959
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT SERVICE

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.060
AVAILABLE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:18.862
THAT IT'S NOT GIVING AWAY.

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:20.764
WITHOUT IT I CAN VACUUM

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:22.733
STRUCTURE. I THANK YOU MISTER

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.301
O'DONNELL- WE WILL NOW MOVE THIS

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:27.137
NUMBER MEDINA. THANK YOU- THANK

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:28.538
YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:31.108
THE BILL FORWARD- IT'S AN ISSUE

00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:32.843
THAT I THINK MANY OF US HAVE

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:34.945
DEALT WITH I THINK AS A YOUNG

00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:37.514
COLLEGE STUDENT- I HAD THAT SAME

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:40.250
EXPERIENCE OF HAVING MY CAR

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:41.318
BREAK DOWN IN. YOU KNOW WASN'T

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:43.287
WORTH A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. AND

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:45.622
SO WHEN I GOT THE BILL FOR

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:47.391
STORAGE YOU KNOW I SAID THANK

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:48.725
YOU. YOU KNOW YOU COULD KEEP

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:51.061
FIVE VW WAS WORTH THAT MUCH. SO

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:53.630
WE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. BUT I

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:55.799
HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THAT I THINK

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:59.136
ARE CONCERNS. OF LOCAL- TOW

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:03.240
TRUCK- OWNERS. AND THE FIRST ONE

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:05.709
IS. AND THE RELATED I BELIEVE

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:07.444
THE FIRST ONE IS YOU KNOW DOES

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:09.179
THE BILL HAVE ENOUGH TEETH IN

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:11.014
THE ENFORCEMENT HE SAID FOR

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:12.582
THOSE COMPANIES WHO CONTINUE TO

00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:15.652
VIOLATE. THERE IS A MECHANISM

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:19.489
FOR CONSUMERS TO- ADDRESSES. BUT

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.258
THE CONCERN THAT I HEARD BACK

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:24.461
HOME WAS- WILL BE ENFORCED HOW

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.697
WILL IT BE ENFORCED DOES IT HAVE

00:49:26.763 --> 00:49:28.565
ENOUGH T. AND THE SECOND

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.768
CONCERN. THAT I HEARD BACK HOME

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:35.372
IN RIVERSIDE WAS- WILL THESE

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:38.875
RESULT IN MORE FEES TO SMALL TOW

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:41.478
TRUCK OPERATORS EMPLOYEE COULD

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:44.648
ADDRESS IT YEAH I KNOW THE ON

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:45.215
THE SECOND ALL STAR BACK IN

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:50.253
AT IT WITH A TRY TO CREATE A

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.188
BALANCED APPROACH TO IT WHICH IS

00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:52.189
WHY WE PARTNERED WITH THE

00:49:52.255 --> 00:49:53.890
CALIFORNIA TOW TRUCK ASSOCIATION

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.525
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT

00:49:55.592 --> 00:49:57.461
FAIR BALANCE IT SO THEY'RE IN

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:58.195
THE ROOM AND THEY'RE WORKING

00:49:58.261 --> 00:49:59.863

SEVEN PEOPLE WHO WOULD BALANCE

00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:16.346
IT OUT. AS IT WAS FOR WHAT WHAT

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:18.515
IT WHAT IT GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:19.750
