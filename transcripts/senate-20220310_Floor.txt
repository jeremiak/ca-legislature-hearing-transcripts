EIGHTY ONE WHICH PROCLAIMS MARCH SEVENTH TO MARCH ELEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO A SCHOOL BREAKFAST WEEK THIS WEEK RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS IN THE CRITICAL ROLE OF STAFF AND MAKING SURE OUR CHILDREN ARE PROVIDED WITH VITAL MEALS. THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL DAYS AS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER I USED TO SEE KIDS COME TO SCHOOL STARVING HUNGRY AND COULDN'T PERFORM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A MEAL SO I USED TO KEEP SNACKS IN MY DRAWERS AND ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO OFFER. BUT THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT ONE IN SIX IN THE STATE WERE LIVING WITH FOOD INSECURITY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND TRAGICALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO REGULAR BREAKFAST WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY. AND NOW THAT STATISTIC WILL LIKELY GO UP AFTER THE PANDEMIC AND AS WE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC WE MUST ENSURE OUR CHILDREN EAT BREAKFAST TO ALLOW THEM TO EXCEL ACADEMICALLY AS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION. AND WE NEED THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR CONCENTRATION WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN HIGHER TEST SCORES I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ALL THE ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES THESE ARE CONSIDERED FIRST RESPONDERS. AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THEY DID DURING THE CRITICAL TIMES EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE HAD TO IMPLEMENT AN ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM MANY WORKING WITH LOCAL NONPROFITS TO CREATE PICKUP SITES DURING THE PANDEMIC THIS WAS IMPERATIVE FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO RECEIVE HEALTHY MEALS. I WANT TO ALSO THANK OUR SPONSOR NO KIDS HUNGRY CALIFORNIA WHO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC THEY PROVIDED GRANTS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING MY DISTRICT BUT NOT ONLY PROVIDE A BREAKFAST BUT ALSO SUPPER FOR SOME OF OUR FAMILIES INCLUDING A MONEY CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AMANI UNION HIGH I SCHOOL.

AND ADVANCING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOL CHILDREN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SCHOOL BREAKFAST IS ESSENTIAL IN% HELPING CHILDREN LEARN TO PERFORM AS VALIDATED BY ENHANCE CONCENTRATION IMPROVE TEST SCORES AND FEWER CLASS DISRUPTIONS. THROUGHOUT THE WORST OF THE PANDEMIC THE EDUCATORS AND STAFF RUN SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND THEIR- AND THEIR STAFFS WERE NOTHING SHORT OF A ROW I CAN SAFELY AND CONSISTENTLY CRAFTING WAYS PROVIDE MEALS TO CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. OFTEN AT SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THEIR OWN HEALTH NOW AS THE PANDEMIC HOPEFULLY CONTINUES TO SUBSIDE THE SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM AND SCHOOL NUTRITION STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN MEETING THE NUTRITIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA.
