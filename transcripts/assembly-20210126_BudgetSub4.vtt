91% WAS WAITING TO CERTIFY. BUT

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.645
A RECALL IN PAST HEARINGS YOU

SAID ONCE WE- IMPLEMENTED THE

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.949
ID ME SYSTEM WE WERE GOING TO

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:23.018
AVOID A LOT OF THIS. SO DOESN'T

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:25.420
SOUND LIKE THAT'S WORKING IF

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:29.057
91% OF THE NEARLY ONE MILLION.

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:30.392
IS NOT THE STILL GOING THROUGH

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:31.894
THE SAME ISSUE OF CERTIFICATION

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.162
HE JUST ELABORATE WHY THAT IS

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:36.999
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY. I DE MI

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:40.335
WAS BROUGHT ON BECAUSE OF THE-

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:41.570
IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE STRIKE

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:44.339
TEAM THAT YOU WERE HAVING TO

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.775
MANUALLY PROCESS. LOOKS LIKE WE

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:49.645
NEED A TO YOUR CALL WE HAD A

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:52.247
60% INITIAL CLAIMS AUTOMATION I

BABY WAS BROUGHT ON IN ADDITION

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:56.418
WITH ADDITIONAL EDT EFFORT TO

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:58.553
INCREASE THAT 290% AUTOMATION

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.122
AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. SO I

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:02.324
DIDN'T CAME ON TO. AUTOMATE THE

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.459

DETERRENT OR FRAUD DETECTION.

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.303

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:17.572
SPEED. THE CERTIFICATION AS

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:20.709

CLAIMANT HAS TO TAKE. IT HAS

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:28.150
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT ME M. EDT

WAGES IF WAGES. IF THEY

RECEIVED EARNINGS THEY HAVE TO

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:45.167
DO THAT- I CERTAINLY MEANT

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:47.269
LOOKING FORWARD TO US SIMPLER

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:48.804
WAY FOR THEM TO DO THAT WELL

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:49.771
IT'S ACTUALLY SIMPLE BUT THEY

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.506
JUST NEED TO DO IT SO WE CAN'T

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:54.609

WAS WHY WE MADE THAT DECISION

01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:34.536

LATER WHEN WE STARTED. TO

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:57.926
WORKING WITH BANK OF AMERICA OR

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.127
WHY IT WASN'T DONE AT BOTH

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:02.297

THAT'S WHERE THOMSONREUTERS

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:12.039
CAME IN AND GAVE US ANOTHER

01:30:12.106 --> 01:30:14.008

BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE ADDRESSING

01:44:05.138 --> 01:44:07.240
ARE THE LONG WAYS ALTHOUGH. THE

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:09.876
LONG LEG. THE LONG DELAY THE

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:11.712
LONG WAIT TIME THAT WAS

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:13.480
INITIALLY EXPERIENCED BY

01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:15.916
CLAIMANTS WHEN- WE SEND THEM

01:44:15.983 --> 01:44:17.050

ON THE ID ME AND- VALIDATE

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:21.421
THEIR IDENTITY. AND BECAUSE OF

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:23.290
THOSE LONG INITIAL WAIT TIMES

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:24.725
AND THEY WERE LONG WE'VE

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:26.259
EXTENDED THE TIME PERIOD TO

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:27.995
LIKE FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH TO

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:29.696
ALLOW EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:31.365
TO GO IN AND VERIFY THEIR

01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:32.799

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:57.658

THAT THAT PERCENTAGE OF TIMES

01:54:22.488 --> 01:54:24.224
REPLACEMENT VARIES DEPENDING

01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:25.592
CLOSE BY CLEMENT AND I'M SURE

01:54:25.658 --> 01:54:29.329
IT ALSO VARIES DEPENDING ON HOW

01:54:29.395 --> 01:54:29.896
QUICKLY THEY RESPOND BACK TO

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:33.199
THE EDT. OKAY AND I'M I'VE HAD

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:34.167

TRUE THAT WE DIDN'T NOTIFY- YOU

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:36.703
DIDN'T NOTIFY CUSTOMERS BEFORE

01:54:36.769 --> 01:54:37.870
FREEZING THEIR CARDS AND THAT'S

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:39.472
ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED BY EDT

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:41.107
AND INDEED WE DID NOT VERIFY

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:43.843
INDIVIDUALS IT'S ALSO IN THE L.

01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:46.112
A. O.'S ANALYSIS IT IT SAYS

01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:50.016
THAT BE HAVE A DOES NOT HAVE

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:51.417
CUSTOMER CONTACT INFORMATION.

01:54:51.484 --> 01:54:53.686
IS THAT TRUE. AND SO YOU CAN'T

01:54:53.753 --> 01:54:57.724
COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE. SO

01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:59.559
INITIALLY THERE THERE WERE A

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:01.160
SERIES OF CARS THAT WERE FROZEN

01:55:01.227 --> 01:55:02.562
WHERE WE DIDN'T SEND NOTICES WE

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:05.365
NOW SEND NOTICES WHEN A CAR IS

01:55:05.431 --> 01:55:06.032
FROZEN WHEREVER AND WHENEVER WE

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:08.134
CAN- BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:09.168
WE DON'T HAVE THE CONTACT

01:55:09.235 --> 01:55:10.536
INFORMATION FOR A CARDHOLDER

01:55:10.603 --> 01:55:12.605
BEYOND THE ADDRESS TO WHICH THE

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:14.707
CARD WAS SENSE. AND UNDER

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:16.776
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE BELIEVE

01:55:16.843 --> 01:55:19.145
THAT THE- THE ADDRESS COULD

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:20.980
ALSO CORRESPOND TO A FRAUDULENT

01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:22.248
ACCOUNT. BOARD ELECTION

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:23.616
EQUIPMENT IT'S DIFFICULT TO

01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:25.652
FIND AN ALTERNATE WAY OF

01:55:25.718 --> 01:55:27.587
SENDING A NOTICE SO WE HAVE TO

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:28.788
WORK WITH THE DUTY TO DO SO.

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:31.257
I'VE HAD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU

01:55:31.324 --> 01:55:32.158
AND I WOULD FIND IT REALLY

01:55:32.225 --> 01:55:33.493
HELPFUL IF I COULD IF WE COULD

01:55:33.559 --> 01:55:35.028
GET THE FOLLOW UP AROUND THE

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:37.563
PERCENTAGE OF AT THE PRISON

01:55:37.630 --> 01:55:39.265
CARDS ON YOUR SIDE THAT TURNED

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:40.366
OUT TO BE LEGITIMATE WITH THE

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:42.335
PROCESSES FOR RECTIFYING NOT

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:43.436
AND IN SOME SENSE OF THE

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:45.972
TIMELINE- THAT SAID THAT IT'S

01:55:46.039 --> 01:55:48.308
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:49.809
THEN I WILL I WANT TO TURN BACK

01:55:49.876 --> 01:55:52.979
ACT REALLY QUICKLY TO YOU- EDT

01:55:53.046 --> 01:55:56.082
SO IT WOULD WHEN YOU SHARED

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:57.317
YOUR OPENING REMARKS AND AS

01:55:57.383 --> 01:55:59.118
WE'VE RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS

01:55:59.185 --> 01:56:00.753
ABOUT THE FRAUD THAT'S BEEN

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.789
EXPERIENCED IT ON SEVERAL

01:56:02.855 --> 01:56:04.223
OCCASIONS YOU POINTED TO THE

01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:05.625
FACT THAT IT WAS THE THIS NEW

01:56:05.692 --> 01:56:06.726
PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT

01:56:06.793 --> 01:56:09.329
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ALL ALL

01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:11.898
STATES IN IN IN IN THE COUNTRY

01:56:11.964 --> 01:56:14.600
HAS BEEN AT VICTIMIZED BY

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:16.736
ORGANIZED FRAUD RINGS AND NIGHT

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:18.371
I CERTAINLY DON'T DISPUTE THAT

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:19.939
TIME UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES

01:56:20.006 --> 01:56:21.341
THE BAD GUYS ARE A LOT MORE

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:23.476
CREATIVE THAN THE GOOD GUYS

01:56:23.543 --> 01:56:26.212
BATES THAT BEING SAID- I THINK

01:56:26.279 --> 01:56:27.680
THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:30.216
HONEST WITH CALIFORNIANS CAN'T

01:56:30.283 --> 01:56:32.785
WITH OURSELVES ABOUT THE PLACES

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:35.288
WHERE OUR PROCESS THESE FAILED

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:37.724
US AND I'M TO ME ARE THE MOST

01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:38.958
OBVIOUS EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:40.993
FACT THAT WE HAVE PAID BILLIONS

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.862
OF DOLLARS OF FRAUD. TO

01:56:42.929 --> 01:56:44.997
PRISONERS IN CALIFORNIA IN OUT

01:56:45.064 --> 01:56:47.734
OF STATE AND THE REMEDY FOR

01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:49.535
THAT AS THE PREVENTION FOR THAT

01:56:49.602 --> 01:56:50.603
WAS ACTUALLY REALLY REALLY

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:52.138
STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT'S NOT A

01:56:52.205 --> 01:56:54.207
SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW WE

01:56:54.273 --> 01:56:55.241
JUST GOT OUT WAITED BY THE

01:56:55.308 --> 01:56:58.611
CRIMINALS- SO I GUESS THAT'S

01:56:58.678 --> 01:56:59.946
THAT'S MOSTLY AN OBSERVATION

01:57:00.012 --> 01:57:03.082
BUT I'M I FEEL LIKE BLAMING THE

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:04.117
P. YOU A AND BLAMING THE FEDS

THE PROGRAM LIKE THERE ARE ON

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:52.598
THE U. I. PROGRAM. BECAUSE THE

01:57:52.665 --> 01:57:56.102
FRAUD HAD BEEN SO RELATIVELY

01:57:56.169 --> 01:57:58.404
SMALL IN THE U. I. PROGRAM ALL

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:01.174

PEOPLE. THE DESIGN OF THE

01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:22.695
PROGRAM WAS FLAWED. AND WE GOT

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:23.296
VERY LITTLE GUIDANCE FROM DEAL

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:27.600
WELL. BEYOND THAT FIRST RELEASE

01:58:27.667 --> 01:58:32.772
OF THE PROGRAM'S. NEVER BEEN.

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:36.609
CLOSE THE COUNTRY AN INCIDENT

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:40.346

01:58:46.252 --> 01:58:49.188
COULD NOT SPEAK BLAKE ABOUT

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:53.226
WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AT THE TIME

01:58:53.292 --> 01:58:55.628
AT THE TIME BUT HAVING HAD

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:56.596

HOW THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. I

01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:10.443
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A STUPID

01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:14.814
MISTAKE I THINK IT WAS OF. WE

01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:17.917
WERE JUST. ALL ACROSS THE

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:22.088
COUNTRY THAT WORST PART ABOUT

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:24.857
IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THIS BOB

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:27.793
NOW I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:31.998
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING. WE

01:59:32.064 --> 01:59:36.869
GOT. STRONG PREVENTION SOONER

01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:39.372
THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. NOT SOON

01:59:39.438 --> 01:59:44.043
ENOUGH. BUT SOONER THIS WAS A

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:47.179
COMPLETE SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM.

01:59:47.246 --> 01:59:49.849
EVERYONE WAS SO CONCERNED ABOUT

01:59:49.916 --> 01:59:53.286
GETTING MONEY OUT. THE SOME OF

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:55.054
THE GUARDRAILS THAT WE USUALLY

01:59:55.121 --> 01:59:59.325
HAVE WERE ACTUALLY CHALLENGING

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:03.496
IT SYSTEMS. AGAIN TO SLOW DOWN.

02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:05.398
THERE WAS FEAR THAT THE SYSTEM

02:00:05.464 --> 02:00:07.967
MIGHT CRASH AND THAT WE WOULD

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:12.805
REALLY BE NOT ABLE. TO- THE

02:00:12.872 --> 02:00:19.912
PEOPLE. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:00:19.979 --> 02:00:22.915
THEY WOULD HAVE. PREPARED FOR

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:23.950
SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER

02:00:24.016 --> 02:00:25.851
HAPPENED AND HAD NEVER HAPPENED

02:00:25.918 --> 02:00:31.691
ON THE SCALE. THAT DOESN'T HER.

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:33.659
PEOPLE ARE STILL SUFFERING WE

02:00:33.726 --> 02:00:36.262
STILL LOST THE MONEY. THERE'S

02:00:36.329 --> 02:00:39.765

THINGS THAT THAT YOU D. D. HAS

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:50.676

TO MEET ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:00:51.944 --> 02:00:53.713
THINGS ABOUT THE KEY WAY OF

02:00:53.779 --> 02:00:56.215

CULTIVATED AND YOU KNOW WE- IT

02:01:04.657 --> 02:01:06.492

ANY KIND OF ATTACK LIKE THIS IN

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:55.540
THE FIFTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE

THESE ISSUES BEFORE THEN. AND I

02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:02.814
DON'T I THINK THIS IS

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:07.252
UNPRECEDENTED. SO WE STARTED

02:12:07.319 --> 02:12:08.453
DETECTING THE- ALL PROGRAMS IN

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:10.989
IN LATE APRIL MAY. WE STARTED

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:13.125
DETECTING THE AND LATE JUNE AND

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:15.527
JULY. AND BY AUGUST WE HAVE WE

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:17.229
RECOGNIZED THAT WE WERE DEALING

02:12:17.296 --> 02:12:17.729
WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:12:17.796 --> 02:12:19.598
UNPRECEDENTED. WE'VE HEARD FROM

COLLEAGUES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:12:21.633 --> 02:12:24.202
THAT THEY BELIEVE- THAT THAT

02:12:24.269 --> 02:12:25.771
CRIMINAL NETWORKS HAVE ACTUALLY

02:12:25.837 --> 02:12:29.341
BEEN SITTING ON A CASH. STOLEN

HAVE A WHEN WAITING FOR AN

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:36.615

HAVE FOUND THIS OPPORTUNITY.

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:42.354
AND I THINK THAT SO IN A WAY-

02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:44.489
BDD IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH THE

02:12:44.556 --> 02:12:48.226

02:41:04.521 --> 02:41:06.523
THAT HAVE COME THE NUMBER THAT

02:41:10.894 --> 02:41:13.196
THE APPROXIMATELY JUST OVER ONE

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:15.599
MILLION HAS BEEN ABOUT THREE

02:41:15.665 --> 02:41:16.833
HUNDRED THOUSAND. ALL OF THOSE

02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:20.303

02:41:20.370 --> 02:41:23.140
FRAUDULENT I DON'T HAVE THE

02:41:23.206 --> 02:41:24.674
EXACT NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY

02:41:24.741 --> 02:41:26.009
HEAD BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT

02:41:26.076 --> 02:41:28.478
WAS ABOUT SIX OR 7% THAT HAVE

02:41:28.545 --> 02:41:31.381

POPULATION- THERE ARE SOME THAT

02:41:37.988 --> 02:41:40.157
HAVE OPENED UP THE EMAIL TRIED

02:41:40.223 --> 02:41:42.292
TO GET ON THE LAKE- BUT I WOULD

02:41:42.359 --> 02:41:44.761
SAY OVER HALF OF THE POPULATION

02:41:44.828 --> 02:41:47.030
HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TO GO

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:50.967
THROUGH IT ME. WAS AROUND ABOUT

02:41:51.034 --> 02:41:52.235
NUMBERS YOU KNOW FROM FROM

02:41:52.302 --> 02:41:54.471

02:41:54.538 --> 02:41:56.106
GET CERTAINLY GIVE YOU THE MOST

02:41:56.173 --> 02:41:58.542
UPDATED NUMBERS- AT ANYTIME BUT

02:41:58.608 --> 02:42:00.310
THAT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:01.411
AND LEST CAROL IF YOU KNOW

02:42:01.478 --> 02:42:02.846
DIFFERENTLY BUT NO THAT'S-

02:42:02.913 --> 02:42:04.047
THAT'S IT NANCY AND I WOULD

02:42:04.114 --> 02:42:05.582
SUGGEST OR I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:07.818

EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WE-

02:42:10.153 --> 02:42:11.421
GAVE EVERYONE THE ADDITIONAL

02:42:11.488 --> 02:42:12.589
TIME TO GO THROUGH IT ME

02:42:12.656 --> 02:42:14.324
BECAUSE THE WAIT TIMES SO AFTER

02:42:14.391 --> 02:42:15.826
FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH WE SHOULD

02:42:15.892 --> 02:42:17.828
START TO REALLY SEE THE MEASURE

02:42:17.894 --> 02:42:20.797
AND ATTRIBUTE FRAUD. OR UNDUE

02:42:20.864 --> 02:42:22.899
INTEREST OR LACK OF NEEDING A

02:42:22.966 --> 02:42:25.035
CLAIM TO A CERTAIN POPULATION

02:42:25.102 --> 02:42:27.070

02:42:27.137 --> 02:42:27.637
ABSOLUTELY GONE THROUGH ITS

02:42:34.478 --> 02:42:37.147
BE CRITICAL IF AGAIN. I CAN GET

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:39.015

02:42:39.082 --> 02:42:43.854

STILL WAITING FOR THEIR MONIES

02:43:04.574 --> 02:43:06.810

02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:57.961
HUNDRED THOUSAND. NUMBER ONE

02:43:58.028 --> 02:44:00.897
MILLION IS FROM BUT WENT OVER

02:44:00.964 --> 02:44:04.201
ONE BILLION OKAY. JUST TO BE ON

02:44:04.267 --> 02:44:06.303
THE SAME PAGE I THINK IT'S

02:44:06.369 --> 02:44:09.306
CRITICAL THAT WE GET. NUMBERS

02:44:09.372 --> 02:44:11.708

02:44:34.598 --> 02:44:36.399
A CONTINUED OPEN COMMUNICATION

02:44:36.466 --> 02:44:37.968
AND DIALOGUE I THINK THE

02:44:38.034 --> 02:44:40.070
COMMUNICATION IS GONNA ADDRESS

02:44:40.136 --> 02:44:42.639

PREVENT. UNDERPAYMENT BUT THE

02:46:46.563 --> 02:46:48.365
MOST URGENT ISSUE FACING OUR

02:47:01.144 --> 02:47:02.779
CAN'T RECTIFY IS A FAMILY THAT

02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:06.049
SEVERAL OCCASIONS NOW BY MY

COLLEAGUES BUT- WHAT WE WON'T

02:47:08.118 --> 02:47:09.586
BE ABLE TO RECTIFY IS A FAMILY

02:47:09.652 --> 02:47:11.554
THAT GETS EVICTED THIS WEEK OR

02:47:11.621 --> 02:47:13.156
A SENIOR THAT CAN AFFORD.

02:47:13.223 --> 02:47:14.724
MEDICATION RIGHT NOW AND IT'S

02:47:14.791 --> 02:47:18.061
CETERA. THE ED'S APPROACH TO

02:47:18.128 --> 02:47:20.063
DATE HAS PRIORITIZED PREVENTING

02:47:20.130 --> 02:47:21.865
A SMALL HANDFUL OF BAD ACTORS

02:47:21.931 --> 02:47:24.234
THAT. FROM RECEIVING FUNDS AT

02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:25.535
THE EXPENSE OF A SIGNIFICANTLY

02:47:25.602 --> 02:47:28.138
LARGER NUMBER OF- LEGITIMATE

02:47:28.204 --> 02:47:31.574

HIGHER PRIORITY THAN

02:47:37.747 --> 02:47:39.883
OVERPAYMENT PREVENTION. WHAT

02:47:39.949 --> 02:47:41.818
STEPS HAS THE EDT TAKEN TO MEET

02:47:41.885 --> 02:47:44.287
THIS RECOMMENDATION AND HOW

02:47:44.354 --> 02:47:45.855
DOES THE SUSPENSION OF ONE

02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:47.857
POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMS

02:47:47.924 --> 02:47:55.865
ADVANCE THIS GOAL. WE WOULD

02:47:55.932 --> 02:47:57.400
LOVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT

02:47:57.467 --> 02:48:03.440
I DO NOT HAVE THAT ANSWER TODAY.

02:48:03.506 --> 02:48:06.476
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL POINTS.

02:48:06.543 --> 02:48:11.147
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT- THAT

02:48:11.214 --> 02:48:12.682

TREMENDOUS WORK WHILE WE STILL

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:35.371
BEEN ONGOING. I DO ALSO WANT TO

02:48:35.438 --> 02:48:37.273
RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT MANY OF

02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:39.042
YOUR STAFF HAVE WORK WORKED

02:48:39.108 --> 02:48:40.944
EXTREMELY HARD IN ORDER TO BE

ABLE TO HELP SERVE SOME OF OUR

02:48:42.879 --> 02:48:44.214
CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE BEEN

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:46.616
FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. FOR

02:48:46.683 --> 02:48:48.117
A MYRIAD OF REASONS THAT HAVE

02:48:48.184 --> 02:48:49.252
BEEN OUTLINED TODAY WHETHER

02:48:49.319 --> 02:48:54.724
TECHNOLOGY. OF WEATHER- THE-

02:48:54.791 --> 02:48:59.229
CONFUSION DUE TO TECHNOLOGY DUE

02:48:59.295 --> 02:49:01.998
TO NOT ABLE TO GET. THE RIGHT

02:49:02.065 --> 02:49:03.266

02:49:03.333 --> 02:49:08.271
TIME OR OR MIX THINGS UP- AND

02:49:08.338 --> 02:49:10.139
OR AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.407
FRANCISCO AGAIN POINTED OUT

02:49:11.474 --> 02:49:16.513
LANGUAGE BARRIERS. SO I ALSO DO

02:49:16.579 --> 02:49:17.680
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I DO

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:19.315
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MR SITE

02:49:19.382 --> 02:49:22.886
MISS SIGNS. ON YOU IN YOUR

02:49:22.952 --> 02:49:25.154
OPENING COMMENTS PRIORITIZING

02:49:25.221 --> 02:49:26.155
THE NEED TO GET CLAIMANTS PAID

02:49:26.222 --> 02:49:28.791
FIRST AND THEN THINK ABOUT THE

02:49:28.858 --> 02:49:31.728
ISSUE OF HOW TO GO AFTER THE

02:49:31.794 --> 02:49:32.262
INDIVIDUALS HAVE COMMITTED

02:49:32.328 --> 02:49:39.369
FRAUD- I. YOU KNOW I FOUND DATA

02:49:39.435 --> 02:49:41.971
COMMENTS FROM OUR BANKING

02:49:42.038 --> 02:49:43.907
PARTNERS VERY INTERESTING-

02:49:43.973 --> 02:49:48.177
MISTER FOX AND MR MAD. IBM I

02:49:48.244 --> 02:49:49.913
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT IN

02:49:49.979 --> 02:49:54.617
ELEVEN YEARS. TEN YEARS. SINCE

02:49:54.684 --> 02:49:55.251
WE'RE ONLY IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR

02:49:55.318 --> 02:49:58.054
BY FEW DAYS- THAT WE WOULD HAVE

02:49:58.121 --> 02:50:00.723
AND COMING FROM ONE OF THE

02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:02.559
WORST ECONOMIC RECESSIONS

02:50:02.625 --> 02:50:06.129
CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN. IN TWO

02:50:06.195 --> 02:50:06.729
THOUSAND TEN WHEN YOU GOT YOUR

02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:08.331
CONTRACT FROM REMEMBERING THIS

02:50:08.398 --> 02:50:12.168
CORRECTLY. PART OF THE DESIGN

02:50:12.235 --> 02:50:14.671
OF BRINGING YOU IN. PART OF THE

02:50:14.737 --> 02:50:16.339
INTENT OF BRINGING YOU END WAS

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:19.509
ALSO TO UTILIZE THE CAPABILITY

02:50:19.576 --> 02:50:21.477
OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S ABILITY

02:50:21.544 --> 02:50:24.447
TO MANEUVER QUICKLY. AN

02:50:24.514 --> 02:50:27.650
SECURITY SYSTEMS BECAUSE THE

02:50:27.717 --> 02:50:29.752
BUREAUCRACY AND THE STATE HAS.

02:50:29.819 --> 02:50:31.621
CAUSED QUITE A BIT OF

02:50:31.688 --> 02:50:34.390
DEFICIENCIES AND INABILITY TO

02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:35.959
MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY BUT ON THE

02:50:36.025 --> 02:50:38.494
PRIVATE SECTOR. WITH ALL THE

02:50:38.561 --> 02:50:42.432
PRECAUTIONS YOU TAKE. THERE WAS

02:50:42.498 --> 02:50:46.035
A BENEFIT OF YOU COMING IN- AND

02:50:46.102 --> 02:50:47.370
THIS IS WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:50:47.437 --> 02:50:48.438
SAN FRANCISCO WAS TRYING TO

02:50:48.504 --> 02:50:50.206
POINT OUT TO BECAUSE WHEN HE

02:50:50.273 --> 02:50:51.608
ASKED A SPECIFIC QUESTION HE

02:50:51.674 --> 02:50:53.343
WOULD RECEIVE THE SPECIFIC

02:50:53.409 --> 02:50:55.244
RESPONSE FROM YOU MISTER FOX.

02:50:55.311 --> 02:50:57.280
BUT THE INTENT OF WHAT HE WAS

02:50:57.347 --> 02:51:00.216
SAYING WAS THAT YOU SIGNED A

02:51:00.283 --> 02:51:02.952
CONTRACT THAT WOULD BRING TO

02:51:03.019 --> 02:51:05.989
THE STATE A SERVICE THAT WOULD

02:51:06.055 --> 02:51:07.991
OFFER THE BEST PROTECTION

02:51:08.057 --> 02:51:09.926
INVOLVED IN THAT ELEVEN YEAR

02:51:09.993 --> 02:51:14.931
PERIOD. AND SO- I DON'T THINK

02:51:14.998 --> 02:51:16.566
THAT THAT HAS BEEN MET.

02:51:16.633 --> 02:51:19.669
SUBSTANTIVELY NOR AT A PLACE OR

02:51:19.736 --> 02:51:22.005
AT A LEVEL THAT HAS OFFERED THE

02:51:22.071 --> 02:51:24.741
PROTECTION TO. OUR CONSTITUENTS

02:51:24.807 --> 02:51:26.509
THAT THE STATE WAS LOOKING FOR

02:51:26.576 --> 02:51:29.646
WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT IN. AGAIN

02:51:29.712 --> 02:51:30.980
YOU WERE BROUGHT IN AT A TIME

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:33.316
WHEN HE STATE WAS DEALING WITH

02:51:33.383 --> 02:51:33.850
ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC

02:51:33.916 --> 02:51:36.886
CALAMITIES. SO I EXPECT A LOT

02:51:36.953 --> 02:51:38.454
BETTER OF A RESPONSE FROM BOTH

02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:43.059
OF YOU. WHEN A QUESTION IS

02:51:43.126 --> 02:51:45.728
COMING TO YOU TALKING ABOUT THE

02:51:45.795 --> 02:51:48.765
VERY ESSENTIAL AREA. OF WHERE

02:51:48.831 --> 02:51:50.266
YOU ARE AT THE FOREFRONT WHEN

02:51:50.333 --> 02:51:52.001
YOU DEAL WITH SUCH A SENSITIVE

02:51:52.068 --> 02:51:54.337
ISSUE OF. INDIVIDUALS BANK

02:51:54.404 --> 02:51:57.006
ACCOUNTS. YOU ARE AT THE

02:51:57.073 --> 02:51:59.609
FOREFRONT OF SECURITY. AND YOU

02:51:59.676 --> 02:52:01.577
SHOULD HAVE TREATED YOUR STATE

02:52:01.644 --> 02:52:03.946
PARTNERS AND ITS CONSTITUENTS

02:52:04.013 --> 02:52:05.748

02:52:05.815 --> 02:52:08.851
CONCERNED AS YOU WOULD HAVE

02:52:08.918 --> 02:52:11.888
ADDRESSING YOUR OWN CLIENTS- SO

02:52:11.954 --> 02:52:14.090
MANY SIGNS YOU YOU HAVE A TALL

02:52:14.157 --> 02:52:16.893
ORDER AHEAD OF YOU. TO ME THE

02:52:16.959 --> 02:52:18.594
THREE BIGGEST ISSUES WHETHER

02:52:18.661 --> 02:52:20.063
IT'S THE OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY

02:52:20.129 --> 02:52:21.064
WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S THE

02:52:21.130 --> 02:52:23.399
CHANGE IN CULTURE THAT'S

02:52:23.466 --> 02:52:23.866
GREATLY NEEDED IN THAT

02:52:23.933 --> 02:52:26.669
DEPARTMENT. AND ALSO THE CHAIN

02:52:26.736 --> 02:52:27.103
OF COMMAND WITHIN A

02:52:27.170 --> 02:52:29.172
BUREAUCRACY. I WHICH WHICH IS

02:52:29.238 --> 02:52:31.240
PART OF THE CULTURE. BECOMES

02:52:31.307 --> 02:52:32.675
VERY INHIBITING FROM PEOPLE TO

02:52:32.742 --> 02:52:35.645
ACTUALLY. VENTURING OUT A

02:52:35.712 --> 02:52:36.679
LITTLE BIT AND TRYING TO ADD

02:52:36.746 --> 02:52:38.781

02:52:41.217 --> 02:52:42.919
LACKING ISSUES I SEE THIS AS

02:52:42.985 --> 02:52:45.421

02:52:56.899 --> 02:52:58.468
PROBLEMS WILL GET HANDLED

02:52:58.534 --> 02:53:02.038
QUICKLY. WHEN COMMUNICATION IS

02:53:02.105 --> 02:53:05.475
