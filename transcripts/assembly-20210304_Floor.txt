ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR GERMANY MEMORY THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS IT'S WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I RISE TODAY TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF LARRY TITO BAZA A DEAR FRIEND A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE FOR THE ARTS AND AN ICONIC LEADER FOR THE LATINO AND LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITIES IN SAN DIEGO. HE WAS A KIND AND EFFECTIVE FORCE IN OUR WORLD AND HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON SO MANY LIVES INCLUDING MY OWN. LEARY'S PASTOR FOR THE ARTS WENT FAR BEYOND HIS FINE ART GALLERY IN LITTLE ITALY. AS HE BECAME INVOLVED WITH MANY SAN DIEGO ARTS ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING CENTRO CULTURAL DE LA RAZA ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHICANO MEXICAN AND INDIGENOUS AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTERS IN THE SOUTHWEST. WHERE HE SERVED AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. HE BROUGHT A VISION OF UNIVERSAL INCLUSION AND ACCESS TO THE ARTS THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO HIS APPOINTMENT ON THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. BY THEN ASSEMBLY SPEAKER TONI ATKINS WHERE HE WAS ELECTED CHAIR BY HIS COLLEAGUES THIS PAST DECEMBER. LARRY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CHICANO PARK IN BARRIO LOGAN HE PARTICIPATED IN STRIKES AND BOYCOTTS ORGANIZED BY THE UNITED FARM WORKERS. AND EVENTUALLY BECAME CO CHAIR OF THE SAN DIEGO PRIDE COMMITTEE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. LARRY LIFTED UP OTHERS JUST BY BEING HIMSELF. HE LISTENED HE LOOKED TO COMPASSIONATELY IN THE EYES HE CARED ABOUT YOU AND MEET YOU WANT TO CARE. WE LOST LARRY JUST TWO WEEKS AGO AS HE BATTLED HOLDEN. WITH OVER FIFTY THREE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LOST TO THIS PANDEMIC I NEED SOULS MISSED AN IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PARTICULARLY PAINFUL WHEN WE LOSE SOMEONE WHO GAVE SO MUCH TO THE COMMUNITY. THE OUTPOURING OF GRIEF THOUGHTS AND MORE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE. CONSTITUENTS HAVE USE THE DESCRIPTIONS BEACON OF POSITIVITY INCREDIBLE HUMAN. UNCONDITIONAL LOVE WARRIOR TITAN TRAILBLAZER HUMOROUS SNAPPY DRESSER. I USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RECITE IN HIS WORDS IN A RECENT LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO ALWAYS REMEMBER. I'VE BEEN VERY ASSIMILATED AND A LOT OF WAYS BUT WHEN YOU WORK IN THE EYE OF THE STORM IN THE HOUSE THAT WAS BUILT UPON. THE STRUGGLE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME TO MAKE CERTAIN ADVANCES OR REACH CERTAIN LEVELS OF ABILITY IN EDUCATION EVERYTHING BECAUSE A PART OF THAT STRUGGLE. WE CAN'T FORGET WHAT WE ARE NOT A PART OF WHAT WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO. AND HOW MUCH FURTHER WE HAVE YET TO GO. LARRY LEAVES US A LEGACY AND A CULTURE TO ASPIRE TO. LIVE UP TO AND TO CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR AND WE WILL. HE'S GOING MEAN KEEPING LARRY AS HUSBAND HAHNEL AND THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN YOUR THOUGHTS AS WE ENTER IN THE MEMORY TODAY OF LARRY TITO BASEL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR WARDEN. MISTER DAVID CHIU YEAR RECOGNITION THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER FOR YOUR GERMAN IN MEMORY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES IT IS WITH THE DEEPEST RESPECT AND SADNESS THAT ON BEHALF OF MY CITY. I RISE TO ADJOURN THE MEMORY OF LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI. WORLD FAMOUS POET PUBLISHER AND FOUNDER OF THE ICONIC CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE WHO PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND ONE. WELL MISTER FROM THE GETTY PLAN A ROOTS IN SAN FRANCISCO'S NORTH BEACH NEIGHBORHOOD FOR SEVENTY YEARS. HE SPENT HIS LIFE EXPLORING THE WORLD SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FRONTIERS THROUGH THE WRITTEN WORD. AS AN ORPHAN AND LATER AS A WORLD WAR TWO NAVAL COMMANDER. MR FROM GETTING DEVOURED ANY BOOK HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON. IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE HE OPENED CITY LIGHTS THE FIRST INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORE IN THE COUNTRY. TO DEAL AN INEXPENSIVE PAPERBACKS A REPOSITORY BOOKS AND OTHER BOOKS SELLERS IGNORE. CITY LIGHTS QUICKLY BECAME A HUB FOR AUTHORS WHO WROTE THOSE BOOKS. AND AS A PLACE FOR POLITICAL DISCUSSION IT IS EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SPOTS IN OUR CITY. A PLACE WHERE SO MANY OF US HAVE LOST YOURSELVES FOR HOURS. IN THE YEARS AFTER YOU OPEN CITY LIGHTS HE EMERGED AS A SPIRITUAL GODFATHER OF THE BEAT MOVEMENT. BEFRIENDING AND CHAMPIONING MANY OF THE MOVEMENT'S MAJOR FIGURES. HE WAS ARRESTED FOR PUBLISHING BE POURED OUT GAME ALLEN GINSBERG'S POEM HOWL. AN ACT WHICH AUTHORITIES FEARED SPREAD QUOTE LEWD AND INTO THIS DECENT WRITINGS. MISTER FRANK GEHRY'S FIRST MINUTE VICTORY IN THAT CASE MARKED A CRITICAL MOMENT IN SHAPING HIS PHILOSOPHY OF POETRY AS INSURGENT PART. SHORTLY AFTER PUBLISHING HOW HE WAS ATTACKED FOR BLASPHEMY IN HIS OWN POETRY COLLECTION CONEY ISLAND OF THE MIND. HIS DETERMINATION TO PUSH ACCEPTABLE BOUNDARIES RESONATED WITH READERS THIS COLLECTION REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AMERICAN POETRY BOOKS EVER PUBLISHED. IT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT MR FERLINGHETTI. THE FIRST POET LAUREATE OF SAN FRANCISCO WAS AN ICON TO OUR CITY. HIS LEGACY WAS HIS UNAPOLOGETIC QUESTIONING OF DOMINANT POLITICAL VIEWS AND CULTURAL VALUES WHICH IS EMBEDDED IN THE POLITICAL CULTURE NOT JUST IN OUR CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. BUT IN OUR STATE. FOR MANY OF US AS WE WALK THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND CAFES OF NORTH BEACH. IT WILL BE HARD NOT TO BE REMINDED OF THE SPIRIT OF LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI. HIS SPIRIT WILL LIVE ON THROUGH HIS POETRY HIS ACTIONS THROUGH CITY LIGHTS. MAKE YOUR OWN LIGHT CONTINUE TO SHINE ON LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER TAKE YOUR ALSO RECOGNIZED THANK YOU WOULD SPEAK ALSO TO RISE. TO JOURNAL MEMORY OF LAWRENCE FERLINGHETTI I THINK MY COLLEAGUES. FROM SAN FRANCISCO REALLY ECHOED A LOT OF THE BIOGRAPHY AS WELL AS THE SENTIMENT. THAT HE LEADS US WHERE. THERE ARE VERY FEW. AYE COMIC BOOKSTORES IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT THE CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE THAT HE FOUNDED IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM. IT'S NOT JUST THE BOOKSTORE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD COME FROM WITHIN THE CITY BUT THAT TOURISTS WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEY WOULD STOP ON THE WAY AS THEY WERE VISITING. IT HAS BECOME A BEACON FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT LITERATURE. EVEN AT A TIME WHEN INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORES HAVE REALLY BEEN ON THE WAY. THEY HAVE SURVIVED BECAUSE THEY OFFER SOMETHING UNIQUELY. SAN FRANCISCO. I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT. HIS PRESENCE IN HIS BOOKSTORE HAVE REALLY HELPED KEEP SAN FRANCISCO VERY MUCH AT THE LITERARY CENTER WITHIN NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY WITHIN OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN REALLY RECOMMEND A VISIT TO OUR CITY WITHOUT RECOMMENDING THAT ON YOUR WAY THROUGH NORTH BEACH OR CHINATOWN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU STOP BY THE CITY LIGHTS AND- SPEND SOME TIME THERE AND BROWSE THE BROWSE THE ARNOLD AND- MAKE SURE YOU CAN. FIND SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOKS. HIS IMPRINT ON OUR CITY BUT ALSO ON OUR CALIFORNIA CULTURE. CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE BEAT GENERATION. HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO REALLY CHALLENGING THE THINKING. OF OUR SOCIETY. WHEN HE STARTED THE BOOKSTORE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES SEPARATE FISCAL. REFORM REPUTATION FOR THE WAS VERY MUCH NOT THE- REPUTATION IT HAS TODAY. THE IT REALLY WASN'T SEEN AS A PLACE OF CHALLENGING THE NORMS VERY MUCH SEEN AS- MUCH MORE OF A BUTTON DOWN CITY I THINK. VERY MUCH A MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE THIRTY. AND HIS HIS. STORE HIS LITERATURE HIS THINKING. REALLY HELPED. SHAPE OUR CITY INTO THE CITY THIS TODAY. AND WITH THAT I REQUEST THAT WE RESPECTFULLY. ADJOURNED TODAY IN HIS MEMORY. THANK YOU MISTER TANK MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR A GERMAN MEMORY.

AS A PARENT OF TWO PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN ON ZOOM FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW I SHARE THE FRUSTRATION THAT SO MANY OTHER PARENTS SHARE ACROSS THIS ENTIRE STATE IN ASKING THE QUESTION WHEN WILL SCHOOLS. REOPEN UP. WELL THIS PROPOSAL. IS NOT EVERYTHING THAT EVERY PARENT WANTED OR THAT EVERY EDUCATOR WANTED OR THAT EVERY DISTRICT WANTED. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE BEST PLAN MOVING FORWARD DOUBLE GET OUR SCHOOLS OPEN IN AS MANY SCHOOLS OPEN AS POSSIBLE IN THIS ENTIRE STATE. I JUST WANT TO FIRST THANK SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS CHAMBER AS WELL AS OUR STAFFS. WE STARTED THIS YEAR WHEN WE CAME BACK ARE VERY ONE OF OUR VERY FIRST BILLS AB TEN. TO SEND A MESSAGE ON HOW MUCH WE THOUGHT ABOUT RE OPENING SCHOOLS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS AND HOW IMPORTANT ISSUE WAS. SO THAT DISCUSSION GOT JUMP STARTED IN NOVEMBER LEADING TOWARD THE DECEMBER BILL INTRODUCTION. WHICH IS REALLY GOTTEN US TO THIS POINT IN AB EIGHTY SIX SO A. B. EIGHTY SIX AUTHORIZES TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO GO TOWARD SCHOOL RE OPENING. EVERY DISTRICT WILL GET THE MONEY AND IF THEY DON'T RE OPEN. SOME OF THAT MONEY WILL HAVE TO BE RETURNED AT SOME POINT. WHAT IT DOES IS IT HALF THAT. DAHLE DISTRICTS IN PURPLE THAT ARE UNDER A TWENTY FIVE PER ONE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES HAVE TO OPEN TKA THROUGH TWO CLASSES IF YOU'RE FLOWN READ YOU HAVE TO OPEN ALL YOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSES AND AT LEAST ONE GREAT IN YOUR MIDDLE OR HIGH SCHOOL. THIS IS ON TOP OF ALREADY ASKING THE DISTRICTS BRING BACK THEIR SAFE COHORTS. FOR T. K. THROUGH. TWELVE IN ADDITION TO FOUR POINT FIVE SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR LEARNING RECOVERY WE KNOW THAT EVERYBODY WHO HAS BEEN EVERY STUDENT WHO HAVE BEEN ON ZOOM TRYING TO LEARN HAS HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LEARNING LOSS SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT FOUR POINT FIVE SIX BILLION DOLLARS WENT. TO HELP WITH LEARNING RECOVERY. 85% OF THOSE RESOURCES NEED TO BE SPENT. ON IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN DISTRICTS HAVE. FROM NOW TILL THE END OF NEXT SUMMER SO THAT THIS SUMMER NEXT SUMMER NEXT SCHOOL YEAR. TO REALLY. ENSURE THAT THEY CAN GIVE. EVERY STUDENT IN THE STATE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN GET THEM CAUGHT BACK UP TO SPEED AFTER. THIS VERY CHALLENGING COVERT NINETEEN TIME. IN ADDITION THE STATE IS SETTING ASIDE 10% AGAIN 10% OF THE STATE'S VACCINATION FASTED FOR EDUCATORS AND CHILD CARE WORKERS SO WE CAN GET SCHOOLS RE OPENED UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN JUST LASTLY. IT'S SO IMPORTANT HAVE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY WE'VE BEEN HEARING FRUSTRATIONS THAT SCHOOLS THE PLANS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE THAT SCHOOLS ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EDUCATORS ARE SAFE FOR THE STUDENTS ARE SAFE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER SAFETY PLAN TO HAVE HAS TO BE SUBMITTED BY. MARCH FIFTEENTH. WITH THAT. AGAIN I JUST WANT TO ECHO MY APPRECIATION FOR ALL MY COLLEAGUES IN PARTICULAR. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH- FOR REALLY WORKING SO HARD COUNTLESS HOURS OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND REALLY. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARRIVED AT THIS PROPOSAL WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON A. B. EIGHTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER TANK MR FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. BUT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION. TO AB EIGHTY SIX THERE'S  LOT CONTAINED IN THIS FORTY SEVEN PAGE BILL. IT HAS REFERENCES TO TEARS INTO THE DO'S AND DON'TS THAT SCHOOLS HAVE TO ABIDE BY. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT COMES DOWN TO THIS. WILL PARENTS AND STUDENTS SEE THEIR SCHOOLS AT ALL LEVELS. TKT TWELVE OPEN UNDER THIS BILL. LET ME TALK ABOUT THE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF THE REOPEN SCHOOL KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND WHAT YOU'LL HEAR IS THAT THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A FLOOR. FOR WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IN PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP. MEMBERS SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ACTED BUT I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT WE ARE WAY BEYOND. FIRST STEPS. I'M AFRAID THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS BILL. DOES NOT MEET REALITY. THE LONGER SCHOOLS STAY SHUT DOWN THE ACADEMIC CHALLENGES GROW WE KNOW THAT. THE BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS OF OUR CHILDREN GROW LARGER. ANXIETY DEPRESSION SUICIDE OUR PARENTS ARE SEEING THIS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SEEING THIS WE ARE SEEING THIS EVERY DAY MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE FIRE PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITH EDUCATORS STUDENTS SUPERINTENDENT. PERRANCE DOCTORS EVERYONE IN BETWEEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL RE OPENING. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WE NEED TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AT ALL LEVELS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE CAN DO IT SAFELY. AND WE CAN DO IT NOW. WE ARE SEEING SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE NATION IN SOME IN OUR STATE OPENING NOW FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THE CDC. HAS PUT OUT GUIDANCE SAYING THAT SCHOOLS CANNOT REOPEN SAFELY. OUR SCHOOLS HAVE ENDURED THROUGH CONFUSING RESTRICTIONS TEARS MANDATES AND GUIDANCES IT IS THE STATE THIS STATE THAT HAS IMPOSED THIS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL OBSTACLES THAT ARE HOLDING OUR SCHOOLS BACK AND IT IS THIS STATE THAT YOU REMOVE THOSE OBSTACLES AND REMOVE THEM NOW. THIS BILL JUST CREATE A NEW LIST OF RULES AND MANDATES THAT HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED. AND WHAT WILL OUR STUDENTS SEE. AN HOUR OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THREE HOURS FOUR HOURS BEFORE THEIR SCHOOL WILL BE TWO DAYS A WEEK. WILL IT BE THREE DAYS A WEEK. WE DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT SPECIFIED IN THIS BILL OUR STUDENTS NEED TO BE BACK IN THE CLASSROOM NOW BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST PLACE FOR THEIR WELL BEING. AND MY COMMUNITY I HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH SAFETY REVIEW WAIVERS PENDING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO LET THEM REOPEN SAFELY AND QUICKER. THAN THIS BILL. THIS BILL. KEEPS OF THOSE SCHOOLS IN THE BILL. AND DISTRICTS WILL CONTINUE TO FACE UNCERTAINTY IN AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION. THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF THEY KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS BILL IN ITSELF DOES NOT REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO REOPEN THE L. A. TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD EVEN OPINES THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT SPEED UP THE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS. QUICKLY AND SAFELY RE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRIORITIES FACING OUR STATE RIGHT NOW. UNFORTUNATELY THE PARENTS STUDENTS AND TEACHERS WHO WANT TO BE BACK IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT. AND IT CAN BE DONE. THAT'S PUT FORTH A BILL THAT OPENS UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL STUDENTS OF ALL GRADE LEVELS TO BE BACK IN SCHOOL FIVE DAYS A WEEK I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS FONG. THIS QUICK SILVA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SIX SAY SCHOOL PLAN FOR ALL. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT JUST SPOKE IT'S NOT A PERFECT BILL. BUT MUCH OF OUR LEGISLATION IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. AS A TEACHER OVER THIRTY YEARS I RECOGNIZE HOW VITAL NOT ONLY EDUCATION IS BUT IN PERSON EDUCATION. MY HUSBAND IS A TEACHER TEACHING JUNIOR HIGH RIGHT NOW AND OUR DISTRICT HAS BEEN BACK SINCE OCTOBER GIVING THE PARENTS A CHOICE WHETHER TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL. IN PERSON OR TO DO A HYBRID OR EVEN AT HOME LEARNING. I SEE THE STRUGGLES FIRSTHAND WITH GETTING STUDENTS TO LOG ON GETTING STUDENTS TO TURN ON THEIR CAMERAS. AND WHY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO THEIR HOMES THEY'RE SHOWING PARTS OF THEIR LIFE THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE. SO ALL RIGHT TO. KNOW THAT WE HAVE MUCH TO DO. TO GET SCHOOLS BACK READY TO BE OPENED BUT WE MUST NOT SAY NO TODAY. IN LIEU OF THE PERFECT. WE HAVE-TO SAY IT'S TIME IT'S TIME FOR STUDENTS TO BE BCK TO SCHOOL. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO SAY THANK YOU THANK YOU TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN PRIVATE SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOLS THANK YOU WE KNOW YOUR JOB. HAS NOT BEEN EASY. I CAN TELL YOU TEACHING FROM ZOOM AND HAVING STUDENTS IN THE CLASS AT THE SAME TIME IS A JUGGLING ACT. AND MANY OF OUR TEACHERS HAVE DONE THAT. BUT I URGE A YES TODAY. BUT ONCE WE GET STUDENTS BACK IT'S ONLY THE FIRST STEP WE MUST AFTER ADDRESS THE TRAUMA. THE TRAUMA FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE TRAUMA FOR OUR TEACHERS AND STAFF AND WE HAVE A LONG ROAD TO GO BY I HEARD AND I VOTE TODAY. ON AB EIGHTY SIX. THANK YOU MISS CLARK SILVA THIS PARA QUE HAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN I'VE HAD A FRONT ROW SEATS. FOR THE LAST YEAR. FOR WHAT IT MEANS TO ASK OUR CHILDREN TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE THEY HAVE MADE. TO STAY OUT OF THE CLASSROOMS AND OFF THE PLAYGROUNDS. I'VE HELD MY SIX YEAR OLD IS HE CRIED THAT HE COULDN'T DO ONE MORE MINUTE ON ZOOM. I SAT ON THE FLOOR OF MY DAUGHTERS SHE BAGS TO BE BACK ON THE PLAYGROUND WITH HER FRIENDS. I SAT AT THE COUNTER FOR ENDLESS HOURS DOING. COMMON CORE MATH WHICH IS MANY YOU KNOW IS A CHALLENGE. AND SPELLING WITH MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD TO MAKE SURE HE GOT WHAT HE NEEDED. AND I SEEN THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL TOLL THAT THIS IS TAKEN ON OUR CHILDREN. AND A COUPLE WEEKS AGO OUR DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES THEY GOT TO RETURN TO CAMPUS. AND I GOT TO SEE MY CHILDREN LATE BACK UP. I GET TO SEE THEM START SLEEPING AGAIN. I GOT TO SEE THE JOY THAT IT BROUGHT HIM TO BE BACK WITH THEIR FRIENDS. AND EVERY CALIFORNIA CHILD DESERVES THAT. NO MATTER WHETHER THEY'RE IN A BIG DISTRICT ARE SMALL IN ONE WITH RESOURCES OR ONE WITHOUT. AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO I'M SUPPORTING AB EIGHTY SIX TODAY BECAUSE IT IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. AND LET ME BE CLEAR IT IS A STEP. WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO. AND I AM FOR ALL OF YOU. TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE SENATE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE TEACHERS WITH THE ADMINISTRATORS WITH OUR SCHOOL BOARDS AND TO SETTLE FOR NO LESS THAN OUR CHILDREN BACK IN SCHOOL AT LEAST BY THE FALL FULL TIME. ON THE PLAYGROUND WITH THEIR FRIENDS IN THE CLASSROOM LEARNING GETTING THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE FOR THE FUTURE THAT THEY DESERVE THAT IS WHAT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN DESERVE. BUT LET ME NOT LEAVE OUT CALIFORNIA'S WOMEN. THEY HAVE LEFT THE WORKFORCE IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN I THINK ANY OF US COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN THE CHILD CARE BURDENS GET GREAT. IT IS CALIFORNIA'S WOMEN IN THIS NATION'S WOMEN THAT BEAR THAT BURDEN. AND SO THEY LEFT THE WORK FORCE AND SO FOR THE GENERATIONS BEFORE US THAT FOUGHT. FOR WHAT EQUITY WE HAD WE HAVE TO GET OUR KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL WE HAVE TO DO IT AND WE CAN DO IT SAFELY AS YOU HEARD MY COLLEAGUE SAY AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE DATA. SO WE MUST FUNDS THE MEASURES TO DO IT SAFELY GET OUR CHILDREN ON BACK ON CAMPUS AND GIVE THEM THE JOY THAT I SEE IN MY CHILDREN'S EYES WHEN THEY COME HOME EVERY DAY TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED ON THE PLAYGROUND. SO THANK YOU MEMBERS WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. I KNOW THAT TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT I KNOW THAT WE CAN SEE OUR KIDS BACK WHERE THEY DESERVE TO BE. AND I WILL TAKE THIS FIRST STEP AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE STEPS AHEAD. THANK YOU IS PARA QUE HAN. DR CHOI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AND THE MEMBERS. THE WORD THERE IS ARE IN PERFECT.

FAST PLEASE FAST SPEED INTERNET OR EVEN HAVING INTERNET IS DIFFICULT OR NOT AVAILABLE TO THEM. SINCE BEING HERE. I'VE BEEN PROACTIVE IN FIGHTING TO HAVE OUR SCHOOLS REOPEN FOR MONTHS BECAUSE OF THESE CONCERNS. IF WE HAD MORE SOLID WITH LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP IN THE STATE ALL SCHOOL WOULD AND COULD HAVE OPENED A MONTH MONTHS AGO. Y. S. WHILE AB EIGHTY SIX IS FAR FROM PERFECT. IT DOESN'T SURE SCHOOL- WE OPEN SAFELY AND SOONER THAN WHAT WAS EXPECTED TO BE MONTHS AWAY FROM NOW. OR EVEN NEXT SCHOOL YEAR. WE OPENED OUR SCHOOLS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR PARENTS. AND CHILDREN IN MY DISTRICT. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW SCHOOLS ALREADY OPEN AND OFFERING TO CONTINUE TO DO SO WITHOUT HAVING TO CLOSE. HOWEVER LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONTINUE TO NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY ON SOME OF THESE MANDATES. IMPOSED IN THIS BILL SUCH AS ALLOWING THE SCHOOL TO DECIDE THE BEST WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY FOR GRANTS THAT WILL BEST SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF ITS STUDENTS. AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN IS THE PROTECTION FOR SCHOOLS IN REGARDS TO COVERT NINETEEN LIABILITY. NOT ALL SCHOOLS ALL THE SAME IN THE STATE THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL WILL NOT WORK. I'M HOPING THAT WE- CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE MINISTRATION. AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TO BRING THESE CONCERNS OF AND FIND A SOLUTION OR SOLUTIONS. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING S. B. A. SIX BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. FROM LAST WEEK. SO THAT WE COULD WORK OUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE SAW ON THIS THAN THE BILL. LAST WEEK. I AGAIN. I AM VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CONTINUE THESE. CONVERSATION TO ALSO HELP OUR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET BACK SOONER THAN LATER. ONE OF SHARES QUICK STORY. WITH YOU LASTWEEK. I WAS IN MY CAR DRIVING MY CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. I WAS ON A ZOOM CALL. TALKING ABOUT. RE OPENING AND HAVING THAT DISCUSSION. AFTER AFTER BIRTH RIGHT BEFORE I WALKED MY TWO BOYS TO CLASSROOM. MY TEN YEAR OLD STOPPED ME AND SAID. MOMMY WAS THAT ABOUT RE OPENING SCHOOLS. AND I SAY YEAH HE GOES. WE NEED THE SCHOOL BACK PLEASE WE NEED A BACK. AND I LOOKED AT HIM IT BROKE MY HEART. I SAID WE'RE TRYING HONEY WE'RE TRYING WE WILL DO IT WE CAN'T DO THIS YOU NEED TO GO BACK HE SAID. THANK YOU AND THEY GAVE ME A HUG AND WILL OPEN AND IN WALKED IN. OUR CHILDREN THAT. TO CONTINUE NOT TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE IS DETRIMENTAL THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MISS KEY DID DEVELOPMENTAL SOCIAL AND ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES THAT THEY WOULD NEED FOR THE FOR THEIR FUTURE SUCCESS. THANK YOU JUST ONE. MR MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SIX OUR SCHOOLS STATE SCHOOL RE OPENING BELL- THIS IS BEEN AN ELUSIVE TASK TO BRING THIS TO THE FLORIDA VOTE- BEFORE US IT CERTAINLY TOOK A BIT MORE TIME THAN WE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS OUR EYES ARE AUTHOR AND SHE BUDGET CHAIRMAN NOTED WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION IN NOVEMBER. WHEN ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN OF US LAWMAKERS TO FROM SAN DIEGO FROM SAN FRANCISCO LONG BEACH HUNTINGTON BEACH. CONTRA COSTA. WE WERE STATE WE WERE IN THE PURPLE THEN AND WE WERE SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL OF US HAVE KIDS AT HOME. ALL OF US WERE ZOOM PARENTS. AND WE WERE SAYING THAT HAPPENS WHETHER OWN KIDS BUT ALSO WE ARE SEEING THE INEQUITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WITH KIDS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL PRIVATE SCHOOLS WEALTHIER SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE THOUGHT WE SAW THAT JUST WASN'T. EQUITABLE AND FAIR FOR ALL OF US. FAST FORWARD WE WILL CHRIS WENT TO THE PURPLE STAGE. WE WENT THROUGH THE SPIKE OVER THE WINTER NOW WE'RE AT A BETTER SPACE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DOIG THIS ANYWAY. WE TOOK OUR TIME WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE HEARD URBAN DISTRICTS. RURAL DISTRICTS WE HEARD FROM LABOR AND MANAGEMENT AND FOCUSED WHAT'S REALLY NEEDED WHAT CAN HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THEY **** ONE THING ABOUT THREE FOUR WEEKS AGO. LIKE WE HEAR IN MEDICINE DO NO HARM. ALLOW US TO DO WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE NATURAL ANYWAY. THE PROVIDE US MORE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO HELP US OPEN UP. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS. IT FOCUSES ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR. VACCINATIONS IT'S HAPPENING ANYWAY SOMETIMES VERY LUCKY THAN GOOD GOOD TIMING RIGHT HERE WE'RE HAVING A HUGE INFUSION ACROSS THE NATION COMING. TO CALIFORNIA WE'RE PRIORITIZING 10% FOR OUR EDUCATORS OUR TEACHERS ARE CLASSIFIED WORKERS AS WELL AS OUR CHILD CARE WORKERS. SO CLEARLY THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO SPUR DISTRICTS ON THE SIDELINES TO ACT. AND ALSO HELP THAT THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY ACTING. I WISH IT WAS STRONGER MANY OF US WISH I HEAR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA ANA TALKING ABOUT TAKING HER KIDS TO SCHOOL. I HAVEN'T TAKEN MY KIDS TO SCHOOL IN A YEAR. I CAN'T WAIT. FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER WAS THE LAST DAY THAT I TOOK MY KIDS TO SCHOOL ON THE DROP OFF PERSON IN OUR AND OUR FAMILY AND IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHEN WE GO BACK THE REALITY TO SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARE ONLY GONNA BE GOING BACK. FOR MAYBE A DOZEN DAYS IF YOU LOOK AT THE HYBRID LEARNING OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU'RE SAYING BEST CASE SCENARIO. GO BACK MID APRIL. SHUT DOWN MID. JUNE YOU'RE GONG A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK LOOK AT THE CALENDAR. THAT'S DOING EIGHT DROP OFFS. EIGHT DROPS SO WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN. THE SECOND PART OF THIS BILL THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO PUSHED US TO FOCUS ON. IS THE KEY THING AND THAT'S LEARNING LOSS. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY WE OPEN AT SCHOOL NEXT WEEK AND TWO WEEKS. NOT MAGICAL THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET. KIDS BACK AS FAR AS WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. ACADEMICALLY THE PACE RESEARCH THAT CAME OUT A FEW WEEKS AGO. IS UNBELIEVABLY DAMAGING TALK THAT THAT SHOWS THAT THAT WHAT KIDS ARE ARE FALLING BEHIND WHICH KIDS ARE FALLING BEHIND. AND NOT SURPRISING. ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ARE LOW INCOME STUDENTS. A FOSTER YOUTH AT KIDS IN FRONT OF BLACK COMMUNITIES. THEY'RE LEARNING LOSS IS SEVERE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T JUST. THINK THIS IS A PANACEA AND MOVE ON. THIS LEARNING LOSS ISSUE IS REAL. WE DO HAVE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO FOCUS ON. ADDRESSING THAT THIS SUMMER ALL THE WAY THROUGH NEXT SUMMER. FOCUSING ON IN PERSON BECAUSE- OF. MORE ZOOM SCHOOL IS NOT GOING TO CURE THE WELLS. OF THE ZOOM SCHOOL IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT IS THERE IS A REALITY AND WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THIS AGAIN WHEN WE ADOPT OUR FINAL BUDGET IN A FEW WEEKS WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT WHAT THIS MEANS. OTHER CALLING FROM CONTRA COSTA TALK ABOUT GOING BACK IN THE FALL MAXIMIZING IN PERSON. BUT REALIZING THIS LEARNING LOSS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WE CAN JUST. MOVE ON FROM THIS IS THAT CLEARLY THE ISSUE OF THE DAY. NOT JUST RE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS WITH ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES ARE ASKING US TO HELP DO. BUT MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON. OUR STUDENTS HUMAN MAKE SURE THOSE KIDS SUCCEED. AND THEY ARE CERTAINLY THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMIC WELL BEING CALIFORNIA SO THIS. IS A POSITIVE BUILT WITHIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS EMBRACE IT- ACROSS THE STATE. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO HELP AND I'M JUST pGONNA STEP UP RIGHT AWAY. DO THE RIGHT THING. MY DISTRICT HERE. THEY'RE FIGHTING OVER WHAT COLOR THIS GUYS EVERY DAY. AND WE HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND KIDNEYS DISTRICTS AND RIGHT HERE IN OUR HOME CITY. WHO WANT TO GO BACK LIKE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA TALKED ABOUT HER LITTLE SON I'M NOT I WANT TO GO BACK THESE KIDS WANT TO GO BACK SO WE'RE PUTTING THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE WE HEARD YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING VACCINES. SO I'M CALLING ON ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING CALIFORNIA'S WATCHING AND WE DEMAND. THAT WE STOP UP AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YU MR MCCARTY MISS RUBIO IN THE REAR CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO STATURE IN SUPPORT SB EIGHTY SIX. AS A FIRST STEP. TO GETTING OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL I DO WANT TO. POINT OUT A COUPLE OF ISSUES. I HAVE EIGHTEEN DISTRICTS IN MY- IN MY DISTRICT. ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING IS THAT EVEN THOUGH LA COUNTY'S. TEAR IS READY FOR RE OPENING IN MY DISTRICT ARE LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF INFECTION. AND THEY THE COMMUNITIES AFRAID OF GOING BACK TO SCHOOL SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. ABOUT HOW WE ASSIST THOSE DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE A HIGHER RATE AS- HIGHER RATE THEN THE REST OF THE COUNTY THAT'S THE ONE ISSUE THE OTHER ISSUE I WANT TO ADDRESS IS. THE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARE HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR OPERATIONAL READING READING IS WHAT I HEAR FROM MY DISTRICTS AS WELL IS THAT THE TRANSPORTATION AND FUNDAMENTAL SHRUB. SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CAN RETURN TO SCHOOL SAFELY SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS- IN PARTICULAR THAT THAT HAVE THE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION- AS A WAY OF GETTING TO SCHOOL IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT C. H. P. HAS THE RESOURCES TO CERTIFY THE NEW SCHOOL BUT BUS DRIVERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF SCHOOLS OPEN TOMORROW MANY STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE ALL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED SO I WOULD LIKE. US TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION- THESE ISSUES ARE NOT NECESSARILY THOUGHT ABOUT AS A ISSUE TO- AS AND- BARRIER TO REOPEN SCHOOLS WHICH IT ISN'T HOWEVER A LOT OF OUR VULNERABLE STUDENTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO SCHOOL IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAYES RUBIO. IS PETRIE-NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THE SPELL AND FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA KIDS- I RISE TODAY AS A MOM TELL. HER PREVENTIVE PARENTS TODAY LIKE SO MANY OF YOU MY TWO BOYS WHO ARE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AT APPROACHING THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY SINCE THEY ENTERED A SCHOOL DAY HAVE EVERY ADVANTAGE IN EVERY AVAILABLE RESOURCE THEY'VE GOT A COMPUTER THEY'VE GOT WIFI THEY'VE GOT TWO PARENTS WERE THERE TO HELP THEM. AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S STILL REALLY REALLY HARD. AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA KIDS. THAT IS NOT TRUE THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES THEY DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT AND EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE SHATTERED. IT'S THOSE KIDS WHO ARE FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. AND IT'S THOSE KIDS THAT WE NEED TO BE FIGHTING FOR. THEY DON'T HAVE LOBBYISTS I DON'T HAVE A POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE THE DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. THE ONLY HAVE PASSED IN THEIR CORNER. FIGHTING FOR THEM. SO WE NEED TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT WE NEED TO OPEN THEIR SCHOOLS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING IS. WE ARE CREATING A TWO TIERED SYSTEM OF EDUCATION. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT. RICH DISTRICTS. THAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS HIS DOORS OPEN OPEN FOR MONTHS IT'S IN OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. WHERE THE SCHOOLS ARE STILL SHATTERED. THAT SHOULD BE ANATHEMA TO ALL OF US. AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE CAN CHANGE THAT TRAJECTORY SO I AM SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. NOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE FUNDING THAT SUPPORTS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED IN THIS BILL IT REALLY IS JUST THE FIST STEP WE NOW NEED OUR PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE OUR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ARE SCHOOL BOARDS AND OUR TEACHERS. TO STEP UP AND STEP IN ALONGSIDE US SO THAT WE CAN SAFELY RE OPEN OUR SCHOOLS AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA CARD. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR PRIVACY. THANK YOU MISTER NORTH. MISSED GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FROM YOUR DESK THANK YOUMISTER SPEAKER- I WANT TO START BY THANKING MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE- THIS WAS NOT EASY AND REALLY THE LEADERSHIP THAT YOU SHOWED- WAS INCREDIBLE OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M IT STRIKES ME AND HEARING EVERYBODY SPEAK THAT. JUST LIKE THIS PANDEMIC IN SO MUCH WE TALK ABOUT THAT WE ALL KIND OF LIVE IN DIFFERENT WORLDS- I LIKE MANY PEOPLE. HAVE BEEN HOME WITH MY KIDS- FULL DISTANCE LEARNING FOR THE LAST YEAR. AND IT HASN'T BEEN EASY A THREE. KIDS AT HOME BOYS M. ALL TRYING TO BE ON THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND I KNOW THE CHALLENGES. BUT I ALSO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN HARDEST HIT BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND THAT THE FEAR OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS RETURNING ISRAEL. IT'S A REAL FEAR BECAUSE OF SOMEBODY BRINGS HOME COALBED SOMEBODY MAY DIE. IT'S NOT JUST A NASTY FLU IT IS DEATH THE CONTINUE TO HAPPEN WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COVERT RATES THE HIGHEST DEATH RATES IN THE LOWEST VACCINATION RATES SO I KNOW PEOPLE REALLY ANXIOUS TO GET THEIR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL IN EVERY COMMUNITY. BUT THERE IS JUSTIFIABLE FEAR IN SOME OF OURS. AND SO I'M OF COURSE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SOME THE LEARNING RECOVERY LANGUAGE WE GOT IN HERE THAT WAS YOU KNOW THE PIECE THAT THAT I WAS SO PASSIONATE ABOUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE TO REVISIT THIS BUT- I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS I JUST. WANT TO POINT OUT. THERE WERE NEGOTIATIONS MADE BASED ON TIER SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING CHANGED NOW. IT'S KINDA NOT FAIR YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA BE REALLY HONEST SO WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE TEARS AND SUDDENLY EVERYBODY'S AND READ HERE THAT CHANGES THE CLASSES THAT HAVE TO BE OPEN THAT NUMBER CLASSES IN THE TESTING CADENCES. SO IF YOU GET CALLS FROM YOUR TEACHERS UNION A LITTLE UPSET THEY THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE UPSET YOU DON'T NEGOTIATED DEAL AND THEN CHANGE THE PARAMETERS THAT DEAL ON THE DAY THAT WE'RE VOTING ON IT AND I THINK THAT'S JUST WEEK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THAT IT'S A LITTLE. DISHONEST WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH. MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. IF YOU LIVE IN A DISTRICT. WHERE THE COUNTY IS SURE MOVING INTO THE RED HERE. BUT IT'S YOUR PORTION OF THE COUNTY THAT'S PULLING EVERYBODY DOWN. I GUARANTEE YOU I DON'T HAVE THE SAME RATES. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM INSIDIOUS. WE HAVE ALL THE CASES IN OUR- IT'LL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO WE ARE BEING PULLED INTO THE RED BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE AS MANY CASES AND IT DOES. CREATE A DISTURBANCE NOW I'VE TALKED TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY DISTRICT AND THEY'RE WORKING HARD THEY HAVE BEEN. RE OPENING PLANS A MEETING WITH THE TEACHERS UNION THEY THEY HAVE. A PLAN SET. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO MISS OUT ON THE FIRST WEEKS OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY WORKING ON AN APRIL TWELFTH ST. SO ALTHOUGH WE TALK A LOT ABOUT EQUITY IN THIS HOUSE IF YOU WILL. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO ACTUALLY DISTURBING FUNDS WE END UP PUTTING IN RULES THAT SOMETIMES. MEAN THOSE WITH THE LEAST STILL GET THE LEAST. AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THEY WILL ALL BE PENALIZED BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN UP. ON THE DATE THAT WAS SET IN THIS BILL. OKAY STILL SUPPORT THE BILL THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS. AND I SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I HOPE. THAT THIS ISN'T THE LAST TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS. RIGHT AS MUCH AS- AS WE GOT INTO THIS BILL ESPECIALLY LEARNING LOSS AND LEARNING RECOVERY MONEY AND THAT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. THE DISPARITIES THAT CONTINUE TO EXIST IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE HAVE GROWN EXPONENTIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC. WE ARE WE ARE WE DO HAVE MONEY AVAILABLE BUT IT'S AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY IT'S NOT FULLY TARGETED TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST ALTHOUGH WE HAVE AN EQUITABLE A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. THEN THE DISTRIBUTING IT EQUALLY BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT FORMULAS THAT ARE MORE EQUITABLE. WE NEED MORE AND I'M JUST GONNA BE VERY HONEST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY MEMBER ON THIS FLOOR WHO'S GOING TO SAY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE NEED MORE WE NEED MORE TARGETED MONEY IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE BECAUSE IF YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP BEFORE. YOU GUYS WERE GONNA BE PAYING FOR THIS FOR TEN YEARS. IT AND THERE HAVE BEEN KIDS LITERALLY WHO HAVE NEVER LOGGED ON IN MY DISTRICT. WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN SIMPLY SAY WE CAN CATCH THEM UP WE NEED TO PASS A BILL THAT ALLOWS PARENTS THE RIGHT. TO HAVE THEIR KID REDO THE GREAT THIRTY SECONDS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PARENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE IT'S NOT THAT THE TEACHERS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB THEY HAVE BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR KIDS BECAUSE SOME OF OUR KIDS GOT NOTHING THIS PAST YEAR. SO I JUST I HOPE WELL ALTHOUGH FOR THIS AND I HOPE WILL COME BACK AND CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THESE INEQUITIES THAT HAVE GROWN IN TRULY INSURE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WE'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY AND TARGETED MONEY AT THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HURT THE MOST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CONSEILS THIS VALIDATORS. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SIX WHICH THEY'RE NOT PERFECT WILL HELP MORE SCHOOLS OPEN SAFELY. I HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF THIS AGREEMENT BECAUSE ITIS IN FACT FAR FROM PERFECT THE BILL DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH TO HELP REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY OUR MIDDLE. AND HIGH SCHOOLS ADDITIONALLY I WISH WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS NECESSARY AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL THAT WOULD PERMIT OUR SCHOOLS TO BETTER SERVE THEIR STUDENTS IN PERSON. EVEN SO THIS BILL DOES GIVE AN INCENTIVE FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN AND IT PROVIDES RESOURCES TO AID THE TRANSITION TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. IT ALSO MAKES PROGRESS IN VACCINATING OUR TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE. TO ME THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. DISTANCE LEARNING IS HARMING OUR KIDS IN WAYS THAT WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY. AND EVERY STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS A RIGHT TO A QUALITY EDUCATION QUALITY IS KEY AND THUS IN PERSON LEARNING SHOULD BE A RIGHT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. WHOSE PORTRAIT SITS WATCHING US ONCE SAID UPON THE SUBJECT OF EDUCATION NOT PRESUMING TO DICTATE ANY PLAN OR SYSTEM OF RESPECTING IT I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I VIEW IT AS THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECT WHICH WE AS A PEOPLE MAY BE ENGAGED IN. I HAVE HEARD FROM HUNDREDS OF PARENTS STUDENTS TEACHERS ADVOCACY GROUPS THAT ARE ENGAGED AND DESPERATE TO GET THEIR STUDENTS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. THEREFORE THIS BILL IS NOT DONE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS THE REGRESSION OF OUR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS ANXIETY DEPRESSION SUICIDE. FOR DECADES TO COME. WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORKWITH OUR STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS TO OPEN. EVERY SCHOOL FOR EVERY STUDENT OUR CHILDREN DESERVE NOTHING LESS FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MICHELLE OTHERS MR GALLAGHER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS YOU KNOW I THINK ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS. AND ALL OF US. HAVE FACED MANY SIMILAR ISSUES MANY OF US ARE PARENTS OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. AS I AM. AND I CAN TELL YOU IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY AT ALL. TO WATCH THOSE THREE CHILDREN GO THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR WHAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING. IN OUR SCHOOLS TO HAVE A MY OLDEST DAUGHTER NOT BE ABLE TO FINISH EIGHTH GRADE YEAR NOT TO HAVE A GRADUATION. AND A START FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL COMPLETELY ON DISTANCE LEARNING. FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS. HAVE TO MISS OUT ON THAT INTERACTION THAT SHE HAS WITH HER TO SEE THE AFFECT. ON HER MENTAL HEALTH. AND SO I THINK. WE HAVE TO HAVE A SOBER ASSESSMENT HERE TODAY AND WE HAVE TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA GETS AN F. IT GETS AN F. IN HOW IT DEALT WITH EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA DEEMED EDUCATION NOT ESSENTIAL. THAT'S A FACT WE GET MANY INDUSTRIES GOING OPERATING. WE DEEM THOSE INDUSTRIES AS CENTRAL AND WE DEEM SCHOOLS AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN OTHER INDUSTRIES NOT A CENTRAL. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. AND IT'S A TRAVESTY. THAT THAT HAPPENED ON OUR WATCH. NO LONGER BE FAIR I THINK THE LION'S SHARE OF THE BLAME GOES WITH THIS GOVERNOR. BECAUSE THE REASON THAT YOUR SCHOOLS ARE NOT OPEN RIGHT NOW. THE REASON WHY THE GENTLEMAN FROM SACRAMENTO IN MY HOME SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE NOT OPEN RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE OF THE BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK. SCHOOLS THAT WANT TO OPEN CANNOT OPEN BECAUSE THEY'RE IN PURPLE TAR. AND THE GOVERNOR IS THE ONE WHO ESTABLISHED THAT POLICY NOT WITH US. NOT IN THROUGH A DUE PROCESS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THAT SHOULD BE THE WAY THAT POLICIES ARE ENACTED. IN A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. BUT BY ONE MAN MAKING ALL THOSE DECISIONS AND THAT IS THE REASON THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE STILL CLOSED IN MANY COMMUNITIES IN FAR TOO MANY COMMUNITIES IS BECAUSE OF THE BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK AND THE AUDACITY OF THIS MAN TO THEN BLAME US. TO THEM BLAME THE LEGISLATURE AND SAY WE'RE DRAGGING OUR FEET WHEN HE'S THE ONE WHO HAS KEPT THEM CLOSED. THIS WHOLE TIME. AND IF YOU USE THAT ARBITRARY POWER HE COULD OPEN SCHOOLS TOMORROW. BUT HE IS NOT. THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE WERE IN THE SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AND WE ALL HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS. BUT LOOK FOLKS LET'S BE HONEST THE CDC IN DECEMBER SAID THAT WE COULD OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY IN DECEMBER. AND HERE WE ARE IN MARCH. DEBATING AND FINALLY PASSING SOME LEGISLATION THAT LOOK AT BEST AT BEST FOR MOST SCHOOLS- ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GET SOME OPENED IN APRIL. IN A HYBRID MODEL THAT WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT IS DOES NOT WORK FOR WORKING PARENTS. YEAH THAT'S EASY FOR WORKING PARENTS TO SAY OKAY I'M GONNA GO HALF DAYS. DROP THE KID OFF AT IT I'LL COME BACK AND PICK UP AT NOON. ONE O'CLOCK HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK. AND WE ACT LIKE THIS IS GOOD POLICY THAT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE SOLVED ALL THE PROBLEMS YOU KNOW BY DOING THIS TODAY WE GET IN F. CALIFORNIA GETS AN F. AND HOW IT DEALT WITH EDUCATION PERIOD. AND IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING WE ARE GOING TO BE LIVING WITH THIS. FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. WE NEED TO HAVE THAT SOBRE ASSESSMENT HERE. AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO IT IS INEQUITABLE. AS COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE ALREADY GET SHORT CHANGED. AND HOW FUNDING IS ALLOCATED AND MANY OF THOSE SCHOOLS IN THOSE RURAL AREAS ACTUALLY TOOK THE MONEY FROM LAST YEAR AND THEY RE OPENED AND THEY SPENT THE MONEY ON P. P. ON. ON ALL THE THINGS IT TAKES TO HELP REOPEN THE SCHOOL SAFELY. AND THEY SPEND IT AND SOME OF THE LARGER URBAN DISTRICTS DIDN'T SPEND A DIME OF THAT ON RE OPENING THEY STAYED CLOSED. AND NOW UNDER THIS NEW ALLOCATION THIS YEAR. MY RULES ARE GOING TO GET SHORT CHANGED ONCE AGAIN. AS THE ALLOCATION STAYS THE SAME THERE'S NO MINIMUM. ROLE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT I AND OTHERS HAVE ADVOCATED FOR IT'S NOT IN THIS BILL. SO THERE IS A DRESSED. THAT'S ISSUE THE DIDN'T GET ADDRESSED. BUT LET'S NOT FOOL OURSELVES WE SHOULD NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN. WHAT OCCURRED WHAT OCCURRED HERE IN CALIFORNIA MANY OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN OPENED SAFELY THEIR KIDS HAVE BEEN BACK IN SCHOOL WE HAVEN'T. THAT IS MOSTLY ON THE GOVERNOR BUT IT'S ALSO ON US. THANK YOU MEMBERS. MISTER O'DONNELL YOUR RECORD AT YOUR DESK I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SIX I DO THAT AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE A PARENT OF TWO THAT HAVE BEEN- LEARNING ONLINE FOR THE LAST YEAR AND HAS NOT GONE REAL WELL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR SURE- AND ALSO AS A TEACHER. ONE HAS BEEN IN THE CLASSROOM FOR MANY YEARS- BUT LISTEN THIS IS A GOOD BILL. GET SCHOOLS RE OPEN AND ADDRESSES LEARNING LOSS. IT HELPS PRIORITIZE TEACHER VACCINES AND ANYONE WHO SAYS A TEACHER. SHOULD ENTER A CLASSROOM WITHOUT BEING FAXED AND ICE VACCINATED IS FOR MALARKEY QUITE FRANKLY. TEACHERS NEED TO BE VACCINATED IT KEEPS THEM SAFE IT KEEPS OUR FAMILY SAFE KEEPS OUR CO WORKERS SAVE IT KEEPS THE STUDENTS SAFE. SO THE SPEEDS UP GETTING SCHOOLS REOPENED WITH SAFETY PROTOCOLS BEING REQUIRED AN EDITOR ADDRESSES LEARNING LOSS AND ALSO THE SOCIAL AMONG SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN. CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS LEARNING LOSS MONEY THERE'S MORE TO DO BEYOND THIS BILL FOR SURE THIS YEAR AND WE WILL DO IT. WITH SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS BUT TODAY I AM FULLY SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK RICHARD ALL MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN DEBATE RASCHER MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME MR KILEY YOUR RECOGNITION THE REAR CHAMBER. IN SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE- OCCASIONALLY KIDS WIL GET A DAY OFF FROM SCHOOL FOR A SNOW DAY. WHEN THE STORM PASSES AND THE SNOW MELTS. WE DON'T SIT AROUND AND NEGOTIATE ABOUT WHETHER TO OPEN THE SCHOOL BACK UP. IT JUST OPENS. THAT'S WHAT IT'S THERE FOR. NOW THIS VIRUS OF COURSE HAS NOT DISAPPEARED. FAR FROM IT BUT WHAT VANISHED LONG AGO WAS ON THE ONE HAND ANY PRETENSE THAT THE OPERATION OF SCHOOLS PLAYS A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN TRANSMISSION AND ON THE OTHER HAND ANY DOUBT THAT THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS DOES SEARING HARM. THAT HARM IS ESTABLISHED NOT JUST BY THE UNIMPEACHABLE FINDINGS OF STUDY AFTER STUDY BUT BY THE TRAGIC LIVED EXPERIENCE OF FAMILY AFTER FAMILY. IT IS DECISIONS BY PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING. AND ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR. THAT IS BRINGING DEVASTATION DEPRESSION LOSS AND DEATH THE KIDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE ARE KILLING OUR KIDS FOR NOTHING. WE ARE KILLING OUR KIDS FOR NO GOOD REASON. GAVIN NEWSOM'S MONSTROUS SCHOOL CLOSURES ARE AMONG THE GREATEST GOVERNMENT CRIMES OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AT LEAST IN THE NOMINALLY DEMOCRATIC WORLD. AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN COMPLICIT. SURRENDERING TO THE SAME SPECIAL INTEREST IS THE GOVERNOR. PARENTS OF YOUNG KIDS HAVE GONE FROM HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHAT A VIRUSES TO HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHAT CORRUPTION IS. THERE'S AN EDITORIAL IN TODAY'S LA TIMES HEADLINED SORRY WITH THE STATE'S NEWEST DEAL ON SCHOOL RE OPENING WON'T SPEED THINGS MUCH. THE TIME SAYS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF MONTHS AGO. BUT INSTEAD THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE AND MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS A CENTRALLY ELECTED TO THE UNIONS TO THE SIDE. THE RESULTS SADLY CHAU OR EDUCATION LIES IN THE STATE'S PRIORITIES. I PREPARED AN AMENDMENT FOR TODAY. THE FALL OF THE SCIENCE AND OPEN SCHOOLS AS OTHER STATES HAVE. BUT THAT AMENDMENT FAILED IN THE SENATE THIS MORNING AND NOW THIS ASSEMBLY IS GOING TO PASS A BILL THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR ONE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THERE IS NO ESCAPING THE SINGLE BRUTALIZING FACT THAT WE HAVE THE POWER TO END THIS MADNESS AND A REFUSING TO DO SO. WE'RE THE BAD SAMARITAN A PARABLE. WALKING BY A SWIMMING POOL SEEING A CHILD DROWNING AND GOING ON WITH OUR DAY. I'M NOT ASKING ANYONE HERE TO BE A HERO. NOT ASKING YOU TO DIVE IN HEADFIRST AND RUFFLE UP YOUR SUIT. I'M JUST ASKING THAT WE THROW IN A LIFE PRESERVER. WE FIND A DASH OF HUMAN DECENCY IN A CAPITAL OR DECENCY HAS NEVER BEEN IN SHORTER SUPPLY. MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY READING A LETTER FROM ONE OF MY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS MISTER TIM HIGHER WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME. TO LISTEN AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON THE INPUT FROM EDUCATION LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE. I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENTS MADE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR SCHOOLS TO BRING STUDENTS BACK TO CAMPUS AND DO SO IN A SAFE WAY. TULARE COUNTY APPRECIATES THE WINDOW BETWEEN NOW AND APRIL FIRST. TO ORGANIZE AND APPROVAL PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH OUR COMMON GOAL. OF SAFE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WILL ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE AND WILL BE ABLE TO ADD MORE STUDENTS AS PARENTS BECOME MORE CONFIDENT. IN THE SAFETY OF THEIR CHILDREN. WHILE ON CAMPUS AGAIN. THANK YOU AND I FEEL VERY POSITIVE ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN. MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT WITH MY LOCAL SUPERINTENDENTS. AND PARENTS I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT THEY'VE PUT IN OVER THESE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS PUSHING AND FIGHTING FOR AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL. HOWEVER. MY SUPPORT DOES NOT COME WITHOUT A SENSE OF CAUTION. AS WE ARE ALL AWARE THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE BIGGEST BILLS WILL BE VOTING ON THIS YEAR. WITH THAT BEING SAID. I DID NOT COME TO MY SUPPORT LIGHTLY. I'M GRATEFUL THAT THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY TO FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THAT THIS RE OPENING PROCESS IS NOT FINANCIALLY BURDENSOME. NOR ARE THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS THAT COME ALONG WITH IT. I'M ALSO PLEASED THAT WE MANAGE TO REMOVE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT PORTION OF THIS BILL. ANY ROAD BLOCK TO RE OPENING SIMPLY HARMS OUR STUDENTS FARTHER. LET'S BE CLEAR. OUR STUDENTS. ARE SUFFERING WITHOUT ACCESS TO EDUCATION OR SPORTS. FRANKLY THIS PERIOD OF TIME IN OUR HISTORY HAS BEEN THE WORST FOR THEM EVER. TOO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY FALLEN INTO GANGS DRUGS OR WORSE SUICIDE. THESE HAVE ALL BEEN. PERPETRATED BY THIS OVERLY BURDENSOME CLOSURE OF OUR STATE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL STILL LACKS SOME KEY COMPONENTS. I'M STILL VERY TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT THIS PLAN DOES LITTLE TO NOTHING TO BRING OUR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BACK. INTO THE CLASSROOM. I AM FOR US TO CONTINUE WORKING. ON THIS ISSUE TO ENSURE ALL. OF OUR CHILDREN CAN RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SADLY WE CAN ONLY VOTE ON WHAT IS BEFORE US TODAY. WALDSCHMIDT THIS BILL IS AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE PREVIOUS VERSION. I AM ADMITTEDLY SKEPTICAL OF OUR ADMINISTRATION'S ABILITY TO ENACT THIS BILL. LET US ALL BE CLEAR MEMBERS. THIS PROBLEM THAT WE'RE AIMING TO SOLVE HERE IS NOT CAUSED BY US. NOR SHOULD THIS SOLUTION WE'VE ALL WORKED SO HARD ON. YOU SEEN AS A FIX BY OUR GOVERNOR. RATHER THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN PERPETRATED BY OUR GOVERNOR OVER THE PAST YEAR. IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO ME. THERE WERE HAVING TO VOTE ON A MEASURE TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS WHEN WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE GOVERNOR'S ABILITY TO SOLVE IT. WITH A PENCIL DRUG. AND WE'RE ALL AWARE OF HOW MUCH HE LOVES PAN. MEMBERS THE FAMILIES WE REPRESENT HAVE BEEN BEGGING US TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS FOR MONTHS THIRTY SECONDS IT IS HIGH TIME WE LISTEN TO OUR FRIENDS. NEIGHBORS. AND GET OUR KIDS BACK IN THE SCHOOLS AND GET THOSE BELLS OPEN WITHOUT MEMBERS I ASK YOU FOR AN AYE VOTE. ON AB EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I WANT TO JOIN THE PARENTS THAT HAVE RISEN ON THIS FLOOR TO TALK ABOUT. THEIR FAMILY'S EXPERIENCES. IN A FOR MAY ONE OF THE IMAGES. FROM THIS PANDEMIC IN THE DISTANCE LEARNING EXPERIENCE AS A PARENT. WELL AS SEEING BY SIXTH GRADE DAUGHTER. ALONE IN HER BEDROOM DOING JUMPING JACKS IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER SCREEN. WE NEED TO GET. OUR KIDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT MY DAUGHTER AND MY FAMILY WE HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT MY DAUGHTER GOING BACK TO THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE. AND SO. IN AWE. I JUST WANT TO REMIND ALL OF US. THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY I KNOW WE- TALK ABOUT IT A LOT THAT. THE KIDS NEED TO COME FIRST. BUT WE REALLY NEED TO REMIND OURSELVES I MEAN. TO PUT THE POLITICS ASIDE WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE KIDS. YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T JUST MAKE IT UP A POLITICAL ISSUE TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS TO GET OUR KIDS BACK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IN A SAFE WAY. WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT ACKNOWLEDGES. ALTHOUGH LEARNING LOSS ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS THE SOCIAL IMPACTS ON OUR KIDS IN THIS DISTANCE LEARNING. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. RECOGNIZING THIS IS A REAL PANDEMIC THIS IS A REAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND THAT'S A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT TO BALANCE ALL THOSE INTERESTS. BUT AGAIN I AS A PARENT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT AS WE PUSH TO GET OUR KIDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING IT FOR POLITICAL REASONS BUT WE'RE DOING IT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR KIDS. THANK IMAGE MURATSUCHI MYSTERIOUS AND THE REAR CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER TODAY I'D TO SEE OPTICALLY STAND SUPPORT THIS BILL. I WAS ELECTED TO BE THE VOICE. ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH THAT SAID BY STAFF MYSELF SPOKE HER SUPERINTENDENT'S. EIGHTY EIGHT OUR TEACHERS OUR PARENTS OUR STUDENTS ARE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. WHAT WE HEARD FROM THEM IS AT AB EIGHTY SIX IS FAR FROM PERFECT. THERE IS MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IF I WAS TO GIVE THIS BILL RIGHT NOW AS IT STANDS GREAT. I'D GIVE IT A C. MINUS. HOWEVER GETTING OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY OUTWEIGHS. WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. I RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF THIS BILL. INCLUDES FINANCIAL TOOLS FOR OUR SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE STAFFING WHICH IS NEEDED IT ALSO ALLOWS ACCESS TO TEACHERS AND STAFF FOR VACCINATIONS SO HOW DO WE TAKE A C. MINUS. AND IMPROVE IT NUMBER ONE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FUNDING THAT WAS GIVEN TO THOSE FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I CAN TELL YOU FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH FAMILIES. THAT HAVE HAD CHILDREN THAT HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE. THAT HAVE A DRUG OVERDOSES IN DEALING WITH DEPRESSION. AND IT'S INCREASED IMMENSELY THIS LAST YEAR BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FUNDING THAT IS IN THIS BILL FOR MENTAL HEALTH. IT DOESN'T REPRESENT WHAT IS NEEDED. THESE TEACHERS THESE PARENTS ARE TELLING US THAT THIS IS GOING TO GO ON ONCE WE GET THE STUDENTS BACK IN SCHOOL FULLY YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF THIS LAST YEAR. IT ISN'T GOING TO BE OVER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE KIDS THAT ARE STILL GOING TO BE DEPRESSED KIDS THAT NEEDS HELP SO WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER FUNDING AND MUCH MORE FUNDING AND NOT JUST A ONE TIME FUNDING. THIS IS GREAT FOR A YEAR WHAT ABOUT NEXT YEAR. THESE TEACHERS ALSO THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING BACK NEED TO HAVE SECURITY THE STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW THEIR TEACHER WILL BE BACK AFTER A YEAR. SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT. ONE THING THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS I'M SO DISAPPOINTED. AND THE SCANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS SHAREHOLDERS. DECIDED TO PUT TOWARDS INCREASING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. AND LASTLY. I URGE CDPH TO GIVE OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE HOW THE FORTY TO SIX FOR DISTANCING USING GOOD FAITH EFFORTS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN OUR SCHOOLS. SO THAT OUR STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO SAFELY ATTEND SCHOOL FIVE DAYS A WEEK AGAIN WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S FORTY OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THESE KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL. WITHOUT REALLY ANY CASES WE HAVE SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS AS WELL AND THERE IS ZERO CASES SO WHEN YOU SAY LET'S. LOOK AT THE SCIENCE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TOLD LOOK AT THE SCIENCE LOOK AT THE SCIENCE ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THIS POINT AND NOW THE SCIENCE DOESN'T MATTER WILL BE LOOK AT HOW THESE SCHOOLS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS SAFELY. SO IT'S TIME THAT WE GO AND WE USE LOOK AT SCIENCE- THIS DIRECTION IN THIS DIRECTION. I WANT TO KNOW THAT I WILL. I NEED TO SEE EXACTLY VOTE YES ON THIS BUT I ALSO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL NOT GIVE UP. I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR A PARENTS FIRST STUDENTS UNTIL EVERY CHILD IS BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY. FULL TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS DAVIS MISS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES- I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE IMPASSIONED DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OUR SCHOOLS PLAY IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES AND OUR FAMILY LIVES. IN BEHIND THOSE SCHOOLS THE EMPLOYEES THAT PLACE AND IN SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE NOT JUST IN THIS MOMENT. BUT ADDED ON TIME AND I THINK AT TIMES WE FORGET THAT HERE I IN THE LEGISLATURE. EYES ON I THINK THAT DURING THIS PROCESS WE ASK TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES TO ADJUST TO ADJUST TO REMOTE LEARNING. AND THEY DID AND IT'S BEEN HARD FOR THEM TO JUST LIKE FOR A FAMILIES WE ASK THEM TO JUST A HYBRID LEARNING. AND THEY'RE DOING IT AND IT'S HARD. WE'RE ASKING THEM TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM AND AS A FORMER MATH TEACHER FOR THIRTEEN YEARS WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THE PLACE WE NEED OUR KIDS TO BE. BUT WERE AFRAID BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING TO PUT OUR OWN LIFE AT RISK AND TO PUT OUR FAMILIES LEFT AS RISK. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND SO I THE FAMILIES- FADE TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE OKAY THEY'RE NOT SURE THAT THOSE KIDS ARE GOING TO STAY SAFE OR THEY'RE GOING TO BRING SOMETHING HOME TO THEIR FAMILY TO. SPREAD THE DISEASE AT HOME. NOT NOT ALL MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN I HAVE A RATE OF INFECTION OF ONE IN. OF A DEATH RATE OF ONE IN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND HAVE A VACCINATION ABOUT ONE IN. TWENTY IN THE CITY OF ALL GUARDIANS. WEDNESDAY NOT LONG. IN THERE TO SCHOOL. THE SCHOOL THIS. IS NOT GONNA BE OPEN IN MY CAN. BUT I ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE BIGGEST LEARNING. AND THIS WILL BE. AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO CATCH UP WITH. BEEN BEHIND AND I JUST HAVE NO CLUE HOW WE GONNA CATCH UP. IN THIS PROCESS. AND SO I'M GOING TO VOTE I FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. BUT IT'S NOT A STEP THAT I'M SURE IS GOING TO HELP MY COMMUNITY IN ANY WAY FIND THIS THAT I'M SURE IS GOING TO HELP MY MOST WINNABLE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND SO AS THE WORK CONTINUES I HOPE THAT THIS HAS TO BE BROUGHT TO THE TO THIS DEBATE. IS A PASSION THAT WE BRING CONTINUOUSLY. TO FIX INEQUITY THAT PRECEDED ALL OF US IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND TO MAKE SURE WERE PAYING THE DUE RESPECT BUT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE EMPLOYEES AND THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE AT THE END OF THE DAY. CARE ABOUT THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FUTURE AND KNOW. THAT IT IS A GOOD PLACE FOR THEM TO BE BACK. IN THE CLASSROOM. AS WELL IT PAINS ME. TO KNOW THAT HAVE KIDS THAT ARE HOME SUFFERING. I PAINS ME TO KNOW WE ARE BEING ASKED MAKE. REALLY TOUGH CHOICES OUT THERE. AND SO WE NEED TO DO ALL WE CAN TO EXPEDITE VACCINES IN THESE COMMUNITIES. I KNOW THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT THAT- BEFORE FOLKS ARE OUT THERE WORKING ON THIS. THE SOONER WE GET THESE COMMUNITIES THESE HOTSPOTS FAXING NEEDED. NOT TO SEE IF YOU'RE A- TEACHER ARE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE OF THE SCHOOL SITE. BUT JUST ANYONE IS COMMUNITY THE SOONER THAT WE LEVEL OUT THIS CURVE. AND WE GET A COMMUNITY BACK TO DO. THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY WANT TO DO OUT THERE. AND SO I AM COMMITTED TO THE WORK. OF WITH MY COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE THE pALSO MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE OPEN IN SOME CAPACITY AND WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THESE DOLLARS SO I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND THAT. IT'S HELPING. IT'S HELPING NO ONE OF MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY WILL HELP A LOT OF FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY. BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO UNTIL PLEASE REMEMBER. THE IMPORTANT THAT OUR SCHOOLS PLAY- ELLIS SO THAT RESPECT. YOUR AROUND THE **** DURING THIS MOMENT THAT WE ARE ALL STILL DESPERATE. I TO GET OUR KIDS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM FOR WHATEVER REASON OVER. WHAT COMING OUT HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. MISTER GORE. GARCIA AND THE REAR OF THE- YOU ARE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO. AND SO. OF AB EIGHTY SIX AND MOTIVATED BY THE BIPARTISAN CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE. OF THIS CONVERSATION MANY OF YOU WHO HAVE SPOKEN. HAVE CONTRIBUTED. CONSTRUCTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO KEEP OUR EYE ON AND BRING BACK. IDEAS AS PROPOSALS TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE OF IMPROVING THE ISSUES THAT EXIST IN COMMUNITIES POOR COMMUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO LACK THE RESOURCES TO CLOSE THAT ACHIEVEMENT AND I APPRECIATE THAT CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION AND THE CONVERSATION TIED TO THE MENTAL HEALTH INVESTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE AT THE SECURITY ISSUES AROUND THE ISSUE OF THE VIRUS FOR TEACHERS AND STAFF AT SCHOOLS TO COME BACK. WHAT I DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE IS THE CIRCUS PARKING LIKE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THOSE WHO REPRESENT. SUBURB AREAS OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THE SAME IMPACT. OF THIS VIRUS AFFECTING THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IF YOU REPRESENT A COMMUNITY THAT'S POOR AND ONE THAT IS A COVER. FAMILIES ARE NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE. SENDING THEIR CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL TEACHERS STAFF AND ALL THOSE SUPPORTING. MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOLS ARE NOT COMFORTABLE SENDING FACTORS. THAT GOING BACK TO WORK AND HAVING CHILDREN THERE. THE FACT IS THAT YOU KNOW IN DECEMBER AND IN JANUARY WE HAD NO VACCINES. TO SEND PEOPLE BACK TO SCHOOLS IN A SAFE. ENVIRONMENTALIST E. REAL RIGHT AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THE CIRCUS BARKING LIKE COMMENTS HERE GOT A STOP. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A REALITY THAT MANY OF US HERE FACE IN OUR DISTRICTS. THE FACT IS THAT THIS IS A STEP. IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR TEACHERS AND OUR STUDENTS GO BACK SAFELY AND I YOU KNOW I'M A PARENT. OF TWO TEENAGERS SENIORS. AND THE TRADE OFF HERE IS THAT- SENDING THEM BACK TO SCHOOL FOR A GRADUATION CEREMONY. OR THEIR LIVES. THEIR LIVES WAY BEFORE A GRADUATION CEREMONY. KERN OF A SIX YEAR OLD WHO BY THE WAY TESTED POSITIVE ALONG WITH MYSELF MY WIFE AND OUR TWO TEENAGERS. THE BIGGEST FEAR THAT I EVER HAD CAME TO REALITY. THAT ALL OF OUR KIDS WOULD GET SICK AND LUCKILY THANK GOD NONE OF THEM ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL BY THEMSELVES. AND SO THE FACT IS THAT THAT'S THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT AND WE LIVE IN AND SO WE TALK ABOUT WE SHOULD OPEN OUR SCHOOLS A LONG TIME AGO I'M SORRY. YOU'RE LIVING IN A VERY DIFFERENT REALITY THAN THE ONE THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS LIVE.AND SO YOU KNOW I RISE TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE NOT ALTHOUGH NOT PERFECT. IT IS THE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS OPEN UP SAFELY. AND THAT IT'S THE BEGINNING OF OPENING UP. THE ECONOMIES IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE ALL STRIVING TO DO AND I THINK WE CAN DO SO. AS MANY OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE BIPARTISAN COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THIS DISCUSSION- COULD LEAD US TO IMPROVING THIS MEASURE AND THE INVESTMENTS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO THIS ADMINISTRATION. FOR PIVOTING AND BEGINNING TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS 40% OF VACCINES GOING TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF HARDEST HIT. POPULATIONS THAT SHOULD BE. THE FLOOR WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTMENTS. IN OUR ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED COMMUNITIES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HOWEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM OR DEFINED. THE DATA DOES NOT LIE AND THOSE VACCINES WILL BE GOING THERE TO HELP US OPEN UP OUR SCHOOLS AND KEEP OUR CHILDREN OUR FAMILIES AND OUR TEACHERS SAFE AND I KNOW THAT MY LITTLE GIRL IS GOINGTO BE SUPER EXCITED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL GIVEN THAT SHE'S A SPANISH. LANGUAGE LEARNER THAT BEING IN THE CLASSROOM WILL BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND IMPACTFUL WAY FOR HER TO BECOME BILINGUAL AND SUCCEED IN THEIR STUDIES AND AGAIN I HAVE TWO TEENAGERS I WILL BE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL THIS YEAR AND IF IT'S BETWEEN THE CEREMONY. OR THEIR HEALTH AND WELLBEING. WELL THAT'S WHERE I STAND- WITH THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING- TOOL TIMIDLY BE SUCCESSFUL SO AGAIN- I APPRECIATE THE CONSTRUCTIVE BIPARTISAN. DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SHOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO ALSO HEAR FROM ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES WITH THAT I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AB EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GARCIA. MISTER GIBSON IN THE REAR THE CHAMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I FIRST OF ALL WANT TO THANK THE GERMAN FROM STAFF AND SOME SAN FRANCISCO THE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD ON THIS ON THIS- BILL THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A BI PARTISAN- SUPPORT AGAIN I RISE TO SUPPORT AND THEN MY VOICE IS WITH ALL THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY SAID THEY SUPPORT THIS AB EIGHTY SIX WHICH SET FORTH A PLAN. FUNDING NEEDS TO RE OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY BY THE END OF MARCH. WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PLAN IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS UNDERSTAND WORK IN PROGRESS IT IS NOT THE BE ALL END ALL BILL BUT IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT THIS IS A DIFFICULT RESPONSIBILITY THERE WE ALL HELD. WE ALL HILL SINCE THIS PANDEMIC STARTED. THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE CLASSROOM PHYSICALLY. THIS IS ABOUT THE STUDENTS. THEIR FAMILIES STUDENTS ACROSS MY DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING. TO KEEP UP ACADEMICALLY AND WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IF THEY DO NOT RECEIVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. THE LEARNING LOS. FOR COMMUNITIES THAT EVEN DEALING WITH THIS PANDEMIC ARE STRUGGLING EVEN MORE. THERE BEEN DEVASTATED. WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE YOUNG BRIGHT MINDS. THAT COULD ONE DAY STAND ON THIS FLOOR. ONE DAY BE THE LEADERS AND BE THE CHANGE AGENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOT TO KNOW. THAT MY DISTRICT HAS SOME COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUALS WORKING EXTREMELY HARD. THOSE ARE THE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO STEPPED UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN. TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES AND THESE OBSTACLES. BROUGHT ON BY THIS PANDEMIC MANYOF THEM HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK. BUT THEY DID A FOR OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR COMMUNITY. TEACHERS CONTINUE TO DO THEIR BEST DAY IN AND DAY OUT TO SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THIS PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED THE INEQUALITIES THAT HAVE PREVAILED FOR GENERATIONS. AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO LET OUR CHILDREN FALL FURTHER BEHIND. COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT DESERVE A WORKABLE PLAN TO MOVE US ALL FORWARD. WE HAVE WORKED FOR LESS FOR FAR TOO LONG NOW IS THE TIME TO SHOW OUR STUDENTS OUR BABIES OUR CHILDREN THAT THEY ARE WORTH THE INVESTMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WAS STRONG I VOTE FOR CHILDREN FOR OUR STUDENTS FOR COMMUNITY OR AB EIGHTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU MEMBERS SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MR TANG YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. LET ME JUST THANK ALL MARCH ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION. AND DEBATE THAT WE'VE JUST HAD. THIS DISCUSSION. DEMONSTRATES WHY EDUCATION IS PROBABLY OUR MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S PROBABLY OUR TOUGHEST ISSUE. WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND DISTRICTS IN THIS GREAT STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. FROM URBAN TO RURAL RICH TO POOR. WE ALL HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST THING TO DO FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND I BELIEVE THAT EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. REALLY HONESTLY BELIEVE. EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR IS REALLY WHAT'S BEST. FOR OUR DISTRICTS. THIS IS A BILL THAT HAS TO BE WHAT'S THE BEST FOR OUR ENTIRE STATE. INDICT THEN I FULLY RESPECT FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO REPRESENT. AREAS WERE ESSENTIAL WORKERS LIVE BECAUSE THEIR RATES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STAY AT HOME AND BEYOND ZOOM. IS SO WE DO OWE IT TO THEM IN THEIR DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE PROPER. VACCINATIONS THEY GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT'S NEEDED BUT WE HAVE AGAIN. THIS NON ISSUE THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT SINCE JANUARY THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR. IT I WOULD SAY THAT THIS BILL. IS HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE ADVOCACY FROM THIS BODY. IN ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK THIS BODY PARTICULAR CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT IS HOW MANY OF US ROSE BECAUSE WE'RE PARENTS. BECAUSE WE HAD A WATER KIDS. GO THROUGH THIS. WE HAD TO SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT A CONSTITUENT TOLD US. WE GOT IT WE GOT A REMINDER FROM THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSTITUENTS. EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN WE GOT UP. YEAH I HEAR YOU FROM OUR ROLL CALL. I UNDERSTAND THE COOPER THE CONCERNS THE ISSUES ARE ABSOLUTELY. REAL AND THEY'VE BEEN REAL THIS IS A DIVIDE THE WE HAVE A CHALLENGE OF WE HAVE THIS AMAZING STATE AGAIN TO FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. THEN WE HAVE CHALLENGES BETWEEN OUR URBAN IN OUR RULE CALIFORNIA. AT TIMES IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE REPRESENTING TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO DIFFERENT STATES. BUT AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT GONNA WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS WE ARE GOING TO GO. AND GO OUR WAY TOGETHER. WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO BRIDGE THAT DIVIDE. LIKE EVERYBODY SAID THIS BILL MAY NOT BE WHAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU YOUR FAMILY OR POSSIBLY EVEN FOR YOUR DISTRICT BUT I ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST BILL FOR THE STATE RIGHT NOW IT WILL DO THE MOST AMOUNT OF GOOD TO GET OUR SCHOOLS OPENED UPAND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE ON AB EIGHTY SIX.
