WITH US LET ME ASK YOU IF YOU ACCEPT THE MEMBERS AS OUTLINED IN OUNCES ON PAGE NINE COMMENT NUMBER TWO I DO WITH GREAT THANKS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO IMPROVE OUR BILL IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU- SENATE ALAN. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH- AND I WAS JUST THE NEW TELLING MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU WHAT WHAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT- SERIES OF ISSUESTO THINK ABOUT THIS IS OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING SYSTEM. NOW AND THEY'RE A BIG- ISSUES WITH THAT WITH THAT SYSTEM AND- CERTAINLY WE'VE GOT LEGISLATION TO TRY TO FIX. THE SYSTEM WRIT LARGE BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY IS A PRETTY SIMPLE MEASURE. I DEALING WITH A COMPLICATED ISSUE SO CURRENT LAW. PREVENTS THE MANUFACTURE FOR MAKING AN UNTRUTHFUL ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM. SUCH AS EARTH FRIENDLY OR RECYCLABLE. IF IT IF IT IS NOT RECYCLABLE- AND SO NOW HERE'S THE PROBLEM A LOT OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THAT THEIR ITEM IS RECYCLABLE. ARE ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT LAW TO STAMP THE RECYCLING SYMBOL. ON THEIR PRODUCT. SO AND THEY'RE SENDING A SIGNAL TO A CONSUMER THAT AN ITEM IS RECYCLABLE EVEN IF IT REALLY ISN'T. SO HERE'S THE HERE'S THE SAD TRUTH IN CALIFORNIA LESS THAN 15% OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS RECYCLED. RECYCLING COSTS EXCEED THE SCRAP VALUE OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL ITSELF THAT'S PART OF THAT'S WHEN IT WHEN ENORMOUS PART OF THE PROBLEM. THE RECYCLING PROCESS IS EXPENSIVE- AND ACTUALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING AS WELL. HI HOWEVER. I KNOW ALL OF US DUTIFULLY TRIED TO FILL OUR BLUE BINS WITH ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE RECYCLABLE. BUT DOES JUST TALKING CENTER PORCHES AND WE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT ITEMS THAT THAT ARE THAT WE COMMONLY BELIEVED TO RECYCLE BUT THAT BUT THAT IN THE END OF THE DAY ARE NOT. ACTUALLY RECYCLE. AND IN THIS IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM IT'S WHAT WE NOW CALL WISH CYCLING WHERE PEOPLE. PUT ITEMS THAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE RECYCLABLE INTO THE BLUE BAND IN THAT IN DOING SO IT ENDS UP WITH A CONTAMINATING THE RECYCLING STREAM MAKING IT MORE COSTLY TO SORT AND CLEAN THE CHILI RECYCLE MATERIAL I USED TO DO THIS MYSELF AND I'M A REGULAR. I'M ONE OF THESE GUYS WHO LIKE TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE NEWSPAPER. OKAY YOU KNOW- SO HI. MY LILY TIME TO COME IN A LITTLE BAG. IT WAS A RECYCLING SYMBOL STAMPED ON THE BACK. AND I WOULD DUTIFULLY I WOULD LITERALLY SETTING ASIDE AND PUT THE BAG INTO MY BLUE BIN. BECAUSE I THOUGHT HAVING SEEN THE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON MY BACK AND THIS WAS A RECYCLE MATERIAL THE- I. NOW THROUGH THIS JOB I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO VISIT. AMERSON RECYCLING CENTERS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES AND DUMPS. IN THE IT TURNS OUT OF THOSE LITTLE BAGS ARE A REAL PROBLEM NOT ONLY DO THEY END UP COMING UP THE MACHINES. THAT PLASTIC FILM BUT THEY ACTUALLY ALSO END UP CONTAMINATING THE PAPER STREAM THEY GET. THEY GET INTO OUR PAPER STREAM. ORDERLY ONE MANY REASONS WHY CHINA DOESN'T WANT TO RECYCLE MATERIAL ANYMORE BECAUSE ALL THIS. OR THE WHY THE PAPER MILLS AS WELL I THESE PAPER BILLS SHOW UP WITH TONS AND TONS. OF PLASTIC FILM STUCK IT IN THE PAPER BELLS IN IT IT REALLY BECOMES A PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO RECYCLE THAT PAPER. SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF THE MATERIAL IS NOT ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE. I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THE SYSTEM THE WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM HAS TO REMOVE THE ITEM FROM THE CONVEYOR BELT AFTER CYCLING FACILITY IS THE- THING CARTED AWAY TO A LANDFILL. IT'S EXTRA WORK INCREASE WASTE RATES. AND COST OF. A PROCESS TO RECYCLE MATERIAL- A SURVEY JUST RELEASED THIS YEAR BY THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES FOUND THAT MORE THAT. IT'S MORE THAN SEVEN OUT OF TEN CITIES. SO OVER 70% OF OUR CITY'S ANTICIPATE INCREASING WASTE COLLECTION READ BY WAS MUCH AS TWENTY PERCENT. TO COVER THE COST OF MANAGING THE ADDITIONAL WICKS. MEMBERS THIS IS NOT JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM IT'S BECOMING A PART OF THE PROBLEM. FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS IN FACT THE FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO KNOW THIS ALL TOO WELL. THAT THIS COUNTY SACRAMENTO JUST RAISE ITS RATES BY TEN DOLLARS A MONTH. EVERY SINGLE MONTH HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM. THE STREET A LOCAL RECYCLING WE SYSTEMS IS COMPOUNDED AS CONSUMERS MISTAKENLY BELIEVE. THE CHASING ARROW SYMBOL THE SPECIAL RECYCLING SYMBOL OFTEN IN CIRCLES THE PLASTIC RESIN IDENTIFICATION CODE. I THINK WE JUSTIFICATION BELIEVE THAT MEANS THE PRODUCT. IS GOING TO BE RECYCLED IF THEY THROW IN THEIR BLUE BIN. THIS IS A SYSTEM AS YOU MAY KNOW THAT CLASSIFIES ALL TYPES OF PLASTICS FROM NUMBERS ONE THREE SEVEN. IT WAS DESIGNED AS A METHOD FOR WASTE FACILITIES TO PROPERLY SORT PLASTICS NOT. TO SUGGEST LIKE ABILITY TO CONSUMERS. YET AFTER THIRTY YEARS AND USE THE SYMBOL IS GOING TO BE STATE AS UNDERSTOOD AS THE RECYCLING SYMBOL. LET'S BE HONEST WE DON'T KNOW HOW CONFUSING. RECYCLING IS IN IN FACT THE CONSUMER BRANDS. ASSOCIATION RECENTLY PERFORMANCE THAN RECYCLING THE FOUNDER FOR MANY AMERICANS RECYCLING RANKS AHEAD. OF SO IT TURNS OUT THAT KNOWING WHAT HOW TO RECYCLE IS MORE CONFUSING. THAN BUILDING IKEA FURNITURE. DOING YOUR TAXES PLAYING THE STOCK MARKET. OR UNDERSTANDING SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER SEX. AT THE TO THE STATE WIDE COMMISSION ON RECYCLING MARKETS IN CURBSIDE RECYCLING IS RECENT REPORT SINCE CONSUMERS A QUITE THE RECYCLE WORD AND SYMBOL WITH WHICH IS WHAT IS ACCEPTED IN. CURBSIDE RECYCLING BINS OF THE RECYCLE WORD AND SYMBOL MUST BE RESERVED FOR MATERIALS WHICH ARE ACCEPTED IN CURBSIDE BINS AND DO NOT CAUSE CONTAMINATION. AND IN FACT THE COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDED PROHIBITING THE USE OF THE CHASER OF SYMBOL. AND LESS THE MATERIALS TRULY RECYCLABLE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT TAKES THE STATEWIDE COMMISSION RECYCLING MARKET TO CURBSIDE RECYCLING IS REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS AND IMPLEMENT THEM SO. STAY IN FEDERAL LAWMAKER THE PRODUCERS CAN'T LIE TO CONSUMERS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A PRODUCT IS RECYCLABLE. IN IN IN IN ITS VERBAL FORM RECYCLABLE AT USE THEY CAN USE THAT WORD RECYCLABLES IT IS CLARIFIED THIS TO INCLUDE. THE USE OF THE CHASING ARROW SYMBOL. WE REALIZE AN EXISTING CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHICH MATERIAL TYPES ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE CAN DISPLAY ON THE CHASING HEROES THE CRITERIA REQUIRES THE MATERIAL TO BE MORE THAN JUST A TECHNICALLY RECYCLABLE IN SOME LAB ACTUALLY. ABLE TO BE COLLECTED SORTED BALED MEMORY MANUFACTURED INTO NEW PRODUCTS. THE BILL ACCOUNTS FOR MANUFACTURERS USE MATERIALS MIGHT NOT YET MEET THE CRITERIA. BUT WHO ARE WORKING TO INCREASE RECYCLABILITY. LAST CLAMSHELLS EXAMPLE ARE GETTING THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE SO INSTEAD SIMPLY TO. THAT THE MATERIAL ARE PSYCHO THE BILL PROVIDES AN RAMP. ALLOWING THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO RECYCLE THE PROJECT. AS WELL THEY MAKE THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO COLLECT AND EFFECTIVELY SORT AND REPROCESS IT. BY CLARIFYING THAT ONLY ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE MATERIAL AND DISPLAY. THE CHEESY EURO SYMBOL THE BILL. WILL END CONSUMER CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IS RECYCLABLE IMPROVE RECYCLING EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE CONTAMINATION COSTS. AVERAGE LIKELY FACILITIES SO I GOT IT TO REALLY GREAT SPEAKERS FIRST OF ALL HI DECEMBER THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTUALLY COUNSEL. BUT I ALSO HAVE STATEWIDE VINCI GINGER THE STATEWIDE RECYCLING COMMISSION. BUT I'VE ALSO GOT CHUCK CAL GET. WHOSE WITH REPUBLIC SERVICES AND IT'S ULTIMATELY THE FOLKS IN THE WASTE MANAGEMENT SPACE THE HOLLERS AND THE COLLECTORS. WHO I THINK I'VE SEEN HOW PROBLEMATIC OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL NAY. THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I WHILE WHILE THE RECYCLING SYMBOL SYSTEM. BEGAN FOR WITH GOOD WITH GOOD INTENT. IT'S TURNED INTO A BIG MASS WHERE A LOT OF STUFF IS GOING TO TURN THE SYSTEM. THAT SHOULDN'T BE. SO LET'S TURN IT OVER TO YOU MISS SAM ONE. THANK YOU SEVERAL UP REALLY OF THE PEOPLE. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY IF YOU'RE BUYING TO SEE. THANK YOU FOR MUCH I MIGHT EXPAND WITH AN OUT GEORGE FACT COUNCILS AND I'M ADVOCATE FOR THE KILLER. FIFTY THREE FOUR THREE ADDRESSES A PROBLEM WE HAVEN'T CAL. WE CANNOT ACHIEVE A THIRTY ECONOMY FOR AND POLLUTANTS CAN NOT WHAT IS REQUIRED. THE CONSUMER IS FIRST IN THE SORTING AND THEIR FEW AS HIGHLIGHTED IN A RECENT TICKET BY ALL. IT SHOULD BE A FROM NINETEEN STATE THAT 90% OF AMERICA DON'T CONVERSE WHAT THE INSIDE THE CHASING ARROWS. ASSEMBLY AND GOES ON TO SAY THAT 68% OF CONSUMERS ANY PRODUCT WITH SYMBOL FOR ALL SEVEN CODE WOULD BE RECYCLABLE AFTER LEARNING THAT ONLY TWO OF THE SEVEN RESIDENTS ARE RECYCLABLE WHICH IS A PRELIMINARY FINDING OF THE RECYCLING COMMISSION. 73% OF CONSUMERS WERE SURPRISED. TO REDUCE CONFUSION AND THIRTEEN. S. T. M. REQUIRE ZERO WITH THE- TRIANGLE. AND TOOK THEM FIVE YEARS TO DO THAT. HOWEVER MANY FAIR ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE EXISTING MOLD TO RECORD FINISHED. THANK YOU SEE GREEN GUY DID NOT GO FAR BECAUSE THEIR DEFINITION RECYCLED. IS IT OVER PER OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO COLLECTIONS. THE QUESTION IS NOT A QUICK RECYCLING WE ARE COLLECTING TRASH. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE POWER CYCLE TO DETERMINE YOUR REGULATIONS WHICH MATERIALS ARE TRULY RECYCLABLE AND COMPARE THE CHASING ARROW SYMBOL. OUR RESOURCES WILL THEN BE SPENT ON SORTING RECYCLABLES NOT TRASH. THE ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THEY THEY WANT NATIONAL LABELING UNIFORMITY BUT ARE NOT UTILIZING THE NEW ASTM STANDARDS OF THE. SOLID EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE. YOU KNOW WANT YOU TO WERE THE FACT LABELING. AT ONE THIRTY AND TWO IN LATE. CAL MUST AND WE STAND TO HELP ANYONE TO HARMONIZE THIS TRUTH LABELING. NATIONALLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SANBORN. MR HOGAN ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES THANK YOU. SURE MURDERED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON CHECK CALVET DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS REPUBLIC SERVICES THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. WHAT IS RECYCLING. IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT RECYCLING SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. I TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING INVESTED INTO THE SYSTEM AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVE RECYCLING CONTAMINATION REMAINS ONE OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSIVE OBSTACLES. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AN EXTENSIVE MANUAL SORT LINES OPTICAL SORTERS SCREENS SHREDDER'S FLOORS AND OTHER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. BUT THE TRUTH IS THESE ARE DOLLARS USING EQUIPMENT ARE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CONSUMER EDUCATION AND EFFECTIVE SOURCE SEPARATION. OPEN YOUR ATTENTION AND OR LOCAL HOLLER SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY EDUCATING OUR CUSTOMERS ON WHAT IS RECYCLABLE IN EFFORT TO IMPROVE RECYCLING RATES REDUCE CONTAMINATION. AND RECYCLING COSTS. BUT THOSE DOLLARS ARE WASTED IF THE PACKAGING OR MATERIALS INCLUDE MARKINGS THAT FALSELY CLAIMED THESE PACKAGES OR MATERIALS ARE RECYCLABLE. IT'S GOING OF RECYCLABILITY CONFUSE CONSUMERS WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO IDENTIFY CORRECTLY WHICH SHOULD BE PLACED IN RECYCLING THEM. SB FORTY THREE IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT TRUTH IN ADVERTISING DON'T CLAIM YOUR PACKAGING OR MATERIAL IS RECYCLED UNLESS OUR ACTUAL RECYCLING MARKETS FOR THE MATERIAL THAT CAN BE READILY AND EFFICIENTLY REMOVED FROM THE WASTE STREAM. THAT'S ANOTHER. UNDER ALLEN'S TESTIMONY FROM PLASTICS WHILE OFFERING CONSUMERS RELATIVELY CHEAP PACKAGING OPTION WEIGHS VERY LITTLE FOR CYCLING PURPOSES AND COST TO SOLICIT 5% OF THE WAY STREET. THESE BAGS CLOG RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING MACHINERY CREATE LITTER PROBLEMS AT OUR FACILITIES ARE EXPENSIVE TO REMOVE RECYCLING STREAM. THE SERVER SHOULD NOT BE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE SPECTRAL RECYCLABLE UNLESS MARKETS EXIST. THESE BAGS CAN EFFECTIVELY BE REMOVED FROM THE WAY STREET. SB THREE FOUR THREE ENJOYS STRONG SUPPORT FROM STRIKERS BECAUSE IT SETS EFFECTIVELY CLEAR STANDARDS RECYCLABILITY THAT WILL INCREASE RECYCLING EFFICIENCIES IMPROVE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE RECYCLING. AND WILL REDUCE RECYCLING COSTS FROM RAEPAYERS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND RECYCLERS. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAY HEALTHCARE RIGHT AT TWO- ARE THERE ANY OF WITNESS WHO WOULD TO TEST SO.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT CAMP YEAH. SURE SURE SURE REPUBLICAN SEN RUSSELL ONE SECOND. SHE ALL RIGHT SO THE REST OF GO AHEAD THANK YOU I WANT THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR EXCELLENT ANALYSIS OF SB SIXTY TWO AND YOUR THOUGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT RESEARCHER ON THE BILL I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO THANK SENATORS HERTZBERG AND GONZALEZ FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR BEING CAUGHT THERE'S- MANY MEN AND WOMEN WHO DO ESSENTIAL WORK FOR ECONOMY HAVE NOW BECOME MORE VISIBLE THEY ARE HIGHLY SKILLED PROFESSIONALS PRODUCING PROTECTIVE MASKS ANOTHER PP. UNFORTUNATELY OFTEN MAKING AS LITTLE AS FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR DESTRUCTIONS TO THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN FROM THIS PANDEMIC HAVE ACTUALLY MOTIVATED COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOP IN LOS ANGELES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THIS SKILLED LABOR BRANDS ARE REALISING ADVANTAGE OF A STRONG DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN REDUCING REDUCING RISKS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INVENTORY SHIPPING AND OVERSIGHT 65% OF RETAILERS HAVE DECIDED HAVE DECIDED THE ANSWER TO THESE RISKS IS BY ESTABLISHING OR EXPANDING DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING YET. IN MANY WAYS OUR STATE HAS FALLEN BEHIND IN PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE VERY WORKERS- GLOBALLY GARMENT WORKERS AT ONE TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM BRANDS WHO HAD INITIALLY REFUSED TO PAY FOR CONTRACTED WORK AS THE LARGEST INDUSTRY OF ITS KIND IN THE UNITED STATES THE APPAREL MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN L. A. COUNTY ALONE PRODUCES FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTPUT. LESS ANGELES HAS THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF THE GARMENT INDUSTRY FOR SOME TWO THOUSAND GARMENT MANUFACTURERS EMPLOYED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE MOSTLY IMMIGRANT WOMEN. WHO ARE CUTTING AND SEWING DYEING CLOTHING FROM DESIGNER JEANS TO FAST FASHION. RUNWAY TO FAST MASKS ANOTHER PP IS MORALLY AND ECONOMICALLY WRONG FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO DENY GARMENT WORKERS THERE FOR A WEEK FAIR WAGES FORCING THEM TO RELY ON A STATE. RESTITUTION FUND ON THE BRINK OF INSOLVENCY IT'S NOT JUST A FEW BAD ACTORS. IT WILL- THE MORE FOR CEMENT WILL HELP. IN FACT WHICH THAT THE SOMEONE TRENCH THROUGHOUT THE GARMENT INDUSTRY THE RESTITUTION FUND HAS BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH CLAIMS. AND HAS BEEN BACK FILLED WITH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS JUST TO KEEP UP. TAXPAYERS SHOULD NOT BE SUBSIDIZING STOLEN WAGES AND SWEATSHOP CONDITIONS SB SIXTY TWO MAKES CLEAR THAT A BUSINESS CONTRACTING TO HAVE GARMENTS MADE. IS LIABLE FOR UNPAID MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME. TO THE WORKERS WHO MANUFACTURE THE GARMENTS- THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THIS BILL WILL END THE DE FACTO WAGE CAR ABOUT IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY WHICH ALLOWS WERE- MANUFACTURERS TO PAY WORKERS. BY THE PEAS OR OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PIECE RATE- BASICALLY COLLEAGUES WE ARE BACK TO THE DAYS OF THE NINETEEN ELEVEN SURE TRIANGLE SHIRTWAIST. FIRE CONDITIONS IN NEW YORK MANUFACTURERS HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO ENSURE SAFE CONDITIONS. OR THE PROPER MINIMUM WAGE PAYMENTS UNLESS THEY FACE LIABILITY THESE WORKPLACE FILED OF VIOLATIONS- DEEPLY AFFECT OUR VULNERABLE WORKERS AND THE RESILIENCY OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE IN. IS LUKE LEGAL LOOPHOLES HAVE MANY MAINSTREAM INDUSTRY ACTUALLY HOSTILE. TO ETHICAL GARMENT COMPANIES TRYING TO ELIMINATES WORKSHOPS BUILD AN INCLUSIVE AND FAIR GARMENT INDUSTRY ECONOMY AND ENSURE THAT WHEN WE USE THE TERM MADE IN THE USA. THAT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS QUALITY AND JUSTICE THAT IS WHY THIS PAST YEAR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FASHION ORGANIZATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE JOINED OUR EFFORTS TO PASSED SB SIXTY TWO I AM PROUD THAT THIS BILL IS A LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PARTY BILL AS WELL. TODAY WE HAVE TWO EXPERTS ON THE WITNESS LINE GARMENT WORKER ANOTHER LUCILLE'S AND- AS WELL AS MATTHEW DO CARLESS FROM BIDS ATTIC TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR- AND IT IS HUMAN THAT MISS ON A DE LOS RIOS IS ON THE PHONE AND TESTIFYING IN SPANISH WITH MISS DAISY GONZALEZ TRANSLATING IS THAT RIGHT.

LOS RIGHT NOW DEEP UP I LOOKED A WHOLE BUT I MEAN THAT. NOW YOU CAN GET THE DONE. SO WHAT DOES- I HAVE WORKED IN GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DONNA WILL BE AND I'M FIVE YEARS OLD I'VE WORKED IN THE GARDEN INDUSTRY THIRTY. THIRTY YEARS ALL OF CAL GUARD. WE PRO AND MAKE GOOD SALARIES. FOR HUNDREDS OF HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE GET ON YOUR LEVEL I MEAN WAS ABOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE. BUT THE CAR OF LIVING WITH AT THE- TO WORK. ARE FORTY HOURS AT ON TOP IF YOU WANT WORKS- SIXTY. A WEEK WAS BOUGHT. BACK THEN. WE JUST OVER FACTORY WITH ALL THE PERMITS THIS. FROM THE- AFTER ABOUT THREE YEARS WE HAD A COLD TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE BRANDS OF THE COMPANY. FOR PAYING TOO LITTLE FOR PRODUCTION. THERE WERE NO PROFIT AND THERE WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY OUR EMPLOYEES OR RENT. IT WILL THE TOTAL CHANGE FOR US. WE CLOSE DOWN AND STARTED THE POINT AGAIN. CNN SOME OF THE BEST SOME OF THE OTHER YOU KNOW THE MORE CUENTA QUE GET PARA FOR S. I FEEL THAT I'M BACK. I DON'T SEE AN APPLE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A CRIMINAL LAST THEY DON'T WANNA PLAY. HELLO THREE TWO DELIVER A LOT BY LISTEN DOUBLE DON'T GET. I SAID IF YOU WANT PS. MARK ON THE ADULT. HI THIS IS A MESSAGE IN OUR POSTED MINOR BUT I FORGOT FOR THE LAST. BUT HE HAD ME THAT BETTER NOT BE SEE AN FACT THE FUTURE IS ALREADY. HERE NOT REALLY BUT I HAD A PEOPLE. YOU CAN ASK ABOUT HOW TO FIX IT NOTHING. THEY NEED A LITTLE MONICA VALLEY FOR MORE OUT. WHAT DOES HE- THINK. WE'VE NOTICED A PIECE TREE COULD ARE AND WERE SEVERE IT WAS LOW IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT FROM ALITY HI ALL. THE OVERLOOKED SEWING MACHINE AND OR HAVE TO TEACH PAINTING FOURTEEN AND- I GARMENTS DO I HAVE TO SORT TO MAKE ME WAGE. EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY WHICH BE PART IN A HOUR WORK.

UP TWO HUNDRED TO THREE SEVENTY FIVE. OR FOUR HUNDRED ON YOUR SPEED AND SKILL LEVEL. BECAUSE CAL IS NOT HIGH AND NOT A TO WRITE. HE CRISIS. REAL YEAH GOOD BONTA- I THINK WE NEXT ARE GOING TO- MATTHEW DAE CARLENE US IS. THIS MISTER CARLOS CARL ON THE PHONE. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON I'M UNIQUE SAID THANK YOU MISTER ON MEMBER. SIMON ATTORNEY THAT WERE A NON LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION THAT HAS REPRESENTED HUNDREDS THE GARMENT WORKERS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WORK PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB SIXTY TWO. IN OUR WORK WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT IS- THE LOS RIOS DESCRIBES SO POWERFULLY. AND ETHICAL BUSINESSES HAVE SEEN IT TOO WHICH IS WHY AS SENATOR ALSO MENTIONED SO MANY GARMENT INDUSTRY BUSINESSES SUPPORT THIS BILL TO PROTECT WORKERS. TO ELIMINATE SWEATSHOPS IN TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. AS ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND GOVERNMENT STUDIES HAVE MADE CLEAR ABUSE OF THE PIECE RATE IS ONE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE WIDE. WAGE THEFT THAT PLAGUES THIS INDUSTRY. THE PIECE RATE DISCUSSES HOW LOW THE PAY IS TO MAKE SOME FOR SOME MORE DIFFICULT BY COMPLICATING THE WAGE CALCULATIONS. IT ALSO CAUSES HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS WHICH ARE ESPECIALLY ACUTE DURING THIS PANDEMIC IT'S WORKERS HAVE TO RACE TO COMPLETE AS MANY ITEMS. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEY DO NOT GET PAID TIME TO SANITISE OUR WORKSTATIONS WATER WASHED THEIR HANDS. IN ADDITION THE UP CHAIN COMPANIES THAT USE SUBCONTRACTING HAVE THEIR CLOTHING MADE AN UNLAWFUL CONDITIONS ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THESE BRANDS ARE INCENTIVIZE TO CONTRACT WITH THE LOWEST BIDDER. MANY OF WHOM ARE ONLY ABLE TO BID SO LOW BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PAYING WORKERS MINIMUM WAGE. HOW HOLDING BRANDS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ROLE THEY PLAY IN THE PRODUCTION CHAIN WILL INCENTIVIZE THEM TO PAY FOR GOODS AT PRICES COMMENSURATE WITH WORKERS EARNING THE MINIMUM WAGE. ELIMINATING THE PIECE RATE SYSTEM WILL PREVENT MANUFACTURERS FROM SELLING THEIR PAY SO LOW THAT IT'S- ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR WORKERS TO MAKE THE MINIMUM WAGE. THIS BILL IS TARGETED AND ONLY IMPACTS COMPANIES THAT CONTRACT TO HAVE GARMENT DESIGNED OR MANUFACTURED. AND AS LONG AS A CURRENT A LOOPHOLE TO EXISTING PORTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO COMBAT THE ENTRENCHED PATTERN OF WIDESPREAD WAGE AND HOUR VIOLATIONS. THE TIMES COME TO FULLY REALIZE THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF AB SIX THIRTY THREE. TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES THAT THE GARMENT INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA HAS EVOLVED TO EXPLOIT FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

THE REAGAN THANK YOU. VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CARE AND SENATORS I'M PRESENTING TODAY BUT A BILL SB FIVE OH SEVEN THAT WILL MAKE REVISIONS TO LAURA'S LAW BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S IN LAST YEAR'S BILL PS REPORT- AND THIS HAS TO DO. WITH THE ANNOUNCES TO MAKE CLEAR A PERSON. THE SUBJECT OF A HEARING MAINTAINED THE RIGHT TO APPEAR IN COURT IN PERSON IF THEY CHOOSE. TWO MINUTES STATE- FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS EXITING INVOLUNTARY HOLDS HAVE NOT BEEN ENROLLED CONSISTENTLY IN SUBSEQUENT CARE TO HELP THEM TRANSITION SAFELY INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND KEEP THEM CONNECTED TO VITAL RESOURCES. ROUGHLY ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE PLACED IN CONSERVATORSHIP CYCLE BACK TO RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS. DESPITE HAVING SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERED THEIR ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS WHEN THEY EXITED THE CONSERVATORSHIP. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW TO QUALIFY FOR A. O. T. A PERSON'S CONDITION MUST BE SUBSTANTIALLY DETERIORATING THIS CRITERIA ESSENTIALLY PROHIBITS THOSE EXITING MORE REASON RESTRICTIVE TREATMENT SETTINGS FROM ACCESSING A. O. T. EVEN WHEN THEY MAY BENEFIT FROM THE SERVICES. THIS BILL REVISES ELIGIBILITY. REQUIREMENTS THAT APPEARS REASONABLY LIKELY THAT THEY WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR DETERIORATION BASED ON THEIR TREATMENT HISTORY AND CURRENT BEHAVIOR WE WANT COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO OFFER AND PROVIDE IT WITH T. PROGRAMS THAT WILL PROVIDE CONTINUED TREATMENT ACCESS TO RESOURCES TO KEEP THEM N THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND NOT HAVE TO GO BACK INTO CONSERVATORSHIP. THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE EXAM OR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE DEFENDANT HAS THE CAPACITY TO GIVE INFORMED CONSENT REGARDING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS. WE KNOW THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE MEDICATIONS IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S RECOVERY. AND CURRENT LAW EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS AOTI PLANTS FROM INCLUDING INVOLUNTARY MEDICATION. ALLOWING THE EXAM OR TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF MEDICATIONDURING HEARING IS A STEP TOWARDS. INITIATING A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE PATIENT CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY NEED MEDICATION. ESTABLISHING THIS CONVERSATION DURING THE HEARING WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT IS DOCUMENTED IN THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL FILE. WHICH CAN THEN BE REFERENCED DURING FUTURE MEDICATION COMPLIANCE CONVERSATIONS WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. FINALLY THE BILL INCORPORATES A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE AUDITOR TO ALLOW APPEARANCES. BEFORE THE COURT FOR TESTIMONY BY BY THE EXAMINING MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER BY VIDEO CONFERENCING. THEY'RE NOT CALLED OUT IN THE AUDIENCE THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE SUBJECT OF THE PETITION TO ALSO APPEAR IN THE VIDEO IF THEY CHOOSE. AND THEY RETAIN THE RIGHT TO BE PRESENT AT THE HEARING. SPEND IN THE KITCHEN IS ALL THAT HAVING THE ABILITY TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO COMMUNICATE. IS CRUCIAL WE WANTED ACCESS TO CONTINUE LONG AFTER THIS PANDEMIC IS AND- OUR CRIMINAL HEALTH SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING YOU ONLY HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND ANYONE OF OUR MAJOR CITIES TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

I BELIEVE IT'S WORKING OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- SO IN FOLLOWING UP FROMTHE OUT PATIENT BILL THIS KIND OF MOVED INTO THE INPATIENT SPACE- I'M PRESENTING AB SB FIVE SIXTEEN A BILL THAT I THINK IS AN UP TO ACT AS A NARROW AND VERY SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM- WELL THE LAST BILL FOLKS AND OUTPATIENT THIS IS ABOUT IMPROVING THAT NEXT LEVEL. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE PERSON EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CAN BE HELD FOR TREATMENT INVOLUNTARILY IF THEY MEET CRITERIA TYPICALLY WE THINK ABOUT THIS AS A FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND IT'S A FOUR SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. AND THAT IS OF SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THEIR DANGER TO THEMSELVES SOMEBODY ELSE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE FOR BASIC-NEEDS. THEY CAN BE RELEASED OR HEARING CAN BE HELD TO DETERMINE WHETHER CONDITION REQUIRES ADDITIONAL INTENSIVE CARE THAT INTENSIVE CARE ARE STILL WHETHER THE PERSON IS GRAVELY DISABLED OR DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS OR WHETHER THEY'RE ACCEPTING FURNACES OR TREATMENT FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION THIS IS A CERTIFICATION REVIEW THAT JUGGLING TYPICALLY HAPPENS. EITHER BEFORE OR AT LEAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS. UNDER THIS BILL HEARING OFFICER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSIDER INFORMATION REGARDING A PERSON'S MEDICAL CONDITION AS WELL. AND HOW THAT CONDITION BEARS ON THE CERTIFICATION OF WHETHER THEIR DANGER TO SELF OR GRAVELY DISABLED WHEN DETERMINING. WHETHER TO HOLD CONTINUE HOLE FOR ADDITIONAL INTENSIVE TREATMENT. THE BOSTON PEOPLE ON THE STREET AND VERY ILL. AND CLEARLY NOT ABLE TO. THINK RATIONALLY AT THAT POINT- AND WHILE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS IF THEY'RE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. PREVENTS THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF AN ABSCESS OR A BAD CUT OR- ANY NUMBER OF THINGS THAT OCCURS TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE. THEM MENTALLY ILL AND OFTEN LIVING ON THE STREETS AND WE SEE EXAMPLES OF THIS ALL THE TIME. SO THIS WOULD ADD. A SMALLER ADDITIONAL CRITERIA NOT EXPANDING THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING INTO THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY. BUT THOSE THE PEOPLE ARE THERE BEFORE WE SEND THEM RIGHT BACKOUT AGAIN. PERHAPS WE SHOULD SEE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR ALL THEIR NEEDS OR EXTEND THAT TO A TWO WEEK HOLD- OR- BEFORE. ANY FURTHER STEPS ARE TAKEN- CURRENT LAW I WE FEEL CONTINUES TO ADDRESS PEOPLE WITH CONSISTENT PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT ARE. OFTENTIMES LIVING ON THE STREETS UNABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES. AND HAVING RAPID DETERIORATION OF THEIR HEALTH CARE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION- AND IN CONSIDERING. AND CONTINUING THEN TO GO BACK INTO HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE INTO CONSERVATORSHIP OR TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS OR OFTENTIMES INTO OUR JAIL SYSTEMS. WE HAVEN'T DONE A GOOD JOB OF HELPING PEOPLE WHO HAVE LANGUISHED ON OUR STREETS WITHOUT ADEQUATE. AND ACCESS- WHO SUFFER FROM ACUTE MEDICAL CONDITIONS AS WELL PLACING THEM AT EVEN HIGHER RISK AND I KNOW THESE ARE HARD ISSUES AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THEM DEEPLY ON ALL SIDES. I CARE ABOUT THEM DEEPLY PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD. ME TALK ABOUT MY AUNT WHO SUFFERED FROM A CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND HER FAMILY CONSTANTLY WOULD GET HER IN FRONT OF A JUDGE AND SHE WOULD BE LET GO AND ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING. VIOLENTLY RAPED- ENDED UP DYING- BASED ON THAT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO HOLD OR ANY LONGER HER LIVER FORGET MY COUSIN SAYING SHE WASN'T SICK ENOUGH TOKEEP. BUT SHE WAS SICK ENOUGH TO GET RATE. I'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE. I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR INPUT AND THEIR HARD WORK. I HAVE TAKEN AMENDMENTS LAID OUT ANALYSIS THAT TO CLARIFY WHAT A MEDICAL CONDITION IS. NOT AND CANNOT BE SOMETHING THAT JUST BECAUSE FROM BEING HOMELESS- AND IT'S BEEN HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WITHIN A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS. WOULD LEAD TO THAT EVEN EVEN FOR THEIR DEATH. THE PSYCHIATRIST MUST CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN TO CERTIFY THAT RESPECT TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT A PATIENT'S MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT PAY AND THE PATIENT WILL BE PROVIDED TREATMENT PLAN. AND BE DIRECTED TO SERVICES THAT WILL PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. TO BE CLEAR NOTHING IN THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR MANDATED MEDICAL TREATMENT IT ONLY SEEKS TO RESTORE AN INDIVIDUAL'S CAPACITY TO CARE FOR THEIR SERIOUS MEDICAL NEEDS. AND I KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NOTHING ABOUT COPING NINETEEN HAS ADDRESSED OR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND HAS IN FACT. IN MANY GREEK GREEK. ASPECTS MADE IT WORSE THIS BILL I BELIEVE CAN HELP PEOPLE AND I THINK IT STRIKES THAT. BALANCE SO WE ALWAYS TRY TO BACK THE STRIKE BETWEEN. PROTECTING PEOPLE'S PERSONAL RIGHTS. BUT ALSO PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH THE DIGNITY OF CARE. WITH ME I HOPE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS IS RANDALL HAGAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION AND JIM GROSS. THANK YOU SIR EGGMAN AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PASSION ON THE SUBJECT ME WORK ON THIS BILL LET ME ASK YOU IF YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED ON. PAGES EIGHTEEN. TO TWENTY I DO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. MR HAGER IF YOU'RE. ON THE LINE WE'RE GONNA TRY ONE MORE TIME. I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT I AM NOT I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME YOU ARE GO AHEAD AND PROCEED. HELLO OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU AND THAT SORRY ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ISSUES OLD EARLIER I AM RANDALL HAGER I DO REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA- SKATERS IN THE PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA- JUST REAL BRIEFLY AND CENTER EGGMAN JUST A WONDERFUL EXPOSITION OF WHY WE HAVE THIS BILL. AND WHAT IT WOULD DO- WE ARE LOOKING AT- THREE INTERSECTING ISSUES REALLY DYING FROM PREVENTABLE AND TREATABLE HEALTH CONDITIONS ON OUR STREETS. ARE PEOPLE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS BETWEEN FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND FIFTY TWO FIFTIES AND INCONSISTENT. CATIONS IT TERMINATIONS THAT WOULD ALLOW IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES HELP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE THERE'S NOT. MEMBERS JIM GROSS ON BEHALF OF THE- PSYCHIC PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA I DIDN'T I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE WORK OF THE OF THE CHAIR AND MISSION BECAUSE WE WERE. INSTRUMENTAL IN US BEING ABLE TO BRING THIS BILL- TO THE CANADIAN OF FORMULATING STRIKES THE BALANCE THAT CENTER EGGMAN SHOCKING ABOUT BEGIN THIS IS ABOUT A HEARING OFFICER. BEING AUTHORIZED BY STATUTE TO CONSIDER CERTAIN ASPECTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S MEDICAL CONDITION RELATIVE TO THEIR PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION AND THEIR ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES USING NARROWLY CRAFTED TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EVERY POTENTIAL MEDICAL CONDITION THAT INDIVIDUAL MAKE PAGE BUT THOSE THAT HELLO WE ARE ONES THAT- ARE LIFE THREATENING AND THAT. A NEW DIGITAL FOURTEEN DAYS WOULD GIVE- PSYCHIATRISTS IN ANY POSITION THE ABILITY TO PUT THE INDIVIDUAL IN A POSITION TO. BE ABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT- CENTER EGGMAN MENTIONED IS THAT. THIS IS THE SECOND STEP IN WHAT THE LAW PROVIDES A THREE STEP PROCESS A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. A FOURTEEN DAY HOLD AND THEN ULTIMATELY POTENTIALLY CONSERVATORSHIP IT IS THE GOAL OF THE PSYCHIATRIC PSYCHIATRIC PROFESSION SHOULD NOT HAVE PEOPLE GO INTO. CONSERVATORSHIP WE BELIEVE THIS. SKEPTICAL BE TAKEN WITH WHICH TO THE TO HEAR OFFICER CONSIDER THE GOING. THAT OF YOU CAN SEE HER SHE- AND- POURED NEEDING TO BE AND- TO CARE FOR THEM. I GET THANK YOU FOR THE HELP ON- DID MANAGE I KNOW THAT THERE MAY STILL BE SUPPOSED TO FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T QUITE STRUCK OUT BALANCED- WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO TALK.

SEVEN GLAZER MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY I THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL IT'S AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS MEMBERS I'M SURE YOU'VE READ THEM. SO I'M GONNA TRY TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE KEY POINTS HERE THIS BILL BY THE WAY IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE BILL THAT YOU JUST HEARD BY THE SENATOR FROM STOCKTON S. B. FIVE OF SEVEN. CAN I APPLY THE SENATOR FOR HER WONDERFUL WORK IN THE SPACE OF CHANGE PLEASED TO BE PARTNERING WITH HER ON. SB SEVENTY TWO WOULD IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR- THAT CAME OUT JUST THIS PAST SUMMER- IN A REVIEW OF OUR STATE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO EXITED A CONERVATORSHIP. REPLACED ON A CONSERVATORSHIP AGAIN DESPITE HAVING BEEN DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY. RECOVERED PREVIOUSLY. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO GET THE CARE. THAT WOULD KEEP THEM IN A STABLE CONDITION THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT THOSE EXISTING CONSERVATORSHIP SO WHOEVER IS RECENTLY EXITED THEM WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO BE PLACED INTO AN INVOLUNTARY ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IT IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THE TREATMENT WOULD REDUCE THE RISK. OF THE PERSON'S MENTAL HEALTH DETERIORATING WHILE LIVING INDEPENDENTLY. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS USED BY COUNTIES PROVIDE CARE IN A SETTING THAT IS LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN CONSERVATORSHIP. IT ENSURES THAT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE SERVICES SUCH AS PSYCHIATRIC SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ASSISTANCE WITH HOUSING. THE STATE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED THAT INSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT BE USED WHEN APPROPRIATE FOR INDIVIDUALS EXITING CONSERVATORSHIP. BUT AS THE- THE AUDITOR NOTED THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE UNDER CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE THE CRITERIA FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT SERVICES EXCLUDES THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN THEY LEAVE THE CONSERVATORSHIP THIRTEEN STABLE EVEN IF THEY ARE AT RISK FOR DETERIORATING IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. BUT TO BE PUT INTO AN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT CARE THEY HAVE TO BE CLASSIFIED AS SUBSTANTIALLY. ARRAY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW COUNTIES TO USE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AS A STEP DOWN FORM OF CARE. AS INDIVIDUALS TRANSITION TO LIVING INDEPENDENTLY WITH ME IS JULIE SNYDER OF THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. WITH THAT MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR IS MISS SNYDER ONLINE. I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN YOU MAY PROCEED.

THE STREET AN EMERGENCY ROOMS. INVOLUNTARY HOLDS IN CONSERVATORSHIP ARE OFTEN VIEWED AS A WAY TO STABILIZE INDIVIDUALS AND BREAK THIS CYCLE HOWEVER AS SENATOR GLAZER OUTLINED AT THE STATE BUDGET LAST YEAR HIGHLIGHTED HOW THESE INTERVENTIONS FAIL OVER TIME FOR MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE LEFT WITH OUT THE SUPPORT THAT WHICH FACILITATE THEM LIVING INDEPENDENTLY AND SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY. HE LOS ANGELES ALONE SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE EXPERIENCED FIVE OR MORE INVOLUNTARY HOLDSINTERESTED TWO YEAR PERIOD SH AND THAT'S PERHAPS NOT SURPRISING WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THIS CAN'T 90% OF THEM WERE ENROLLED IN THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE METHODS FOR PROVIDING COMMUNITY BASED CARE. WHICH ARE EITHER FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. IN THE CURRENT L. GREAT FOR OUT TREATMENT PREVENTS THOSE WHO ARE EXTRA CONSERVATORSHIP FROM ACCESSING IT. BY REMOVING THAT BARRIER SB SEVEN EIGHTY TWO TAKES A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD IN BRIEF BREAKING THE REVOLVING DOOR CYCLE SH FROM THE INSTITUTE'S PERSPECTIVE OUR GOAL SHOULD ALWAYS BE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE IN ACCESSING THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE TREATMENT POSSIBLE.

TO DETER DEADLY CONDUCT BY LARGE CORPORATIONS MAKES IMPORTANT NEEDLESSLY DUPLICATIVE AN EXPENSE THAT. AND FELT THAT KNOWLEDGE THE CRITICAL ROLE WORKER COMPLAINTS PLAY AND THE EFFORT TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE. WORKPLACE SAFETY VIOLATIONS. THIS IS WHY WE NEED SB SIX OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR DEVELOPER OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. I THINK IF THE STATE DOESN'T SIMPLY RACE COLORS THE PENALTY PROBLEM PLAYERS. BUT TAKE A TARGETED APPROACH RAISING PENALTIES FOR LARGE EMPLOYERS SERVING AS A REAL INCENTIVE. FOR EMPLOYERS TO VOLUNTARY COMPLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. ADDITIONALLY COLORS IT DOES NOT- CURRENTLY HOW COOL THAT IT'S LOCAL DOUBLE CHAIN COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE WHEN AN EMPLOYER THREATENED POLICIES OR PROCEDURES. ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF HEALTH AND AFETY ORDERS. A LARGE CHAIN DRUG RETAILING PLAYER ISSUED EMPIRE WRITTEN POLICY THAT STATED. WORKERS WHO ARE WORKING SIDE BY SIDE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR COCAINE NINETEEN.

RETALIATION FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS MEANS THAT PART OF THEIR FAMILY GOING HUNGRY OR THE FRONT OF THE- ALTAR BENEFITS ANY PANDEMIC. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR EYEBROW ON. THE FACT THAT THE. IT'S REALLY COVERED THE MAIN POINTS BEHIND THIS BILL WE JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE A FEW QUICK ONES. THE FIRST IS THAT THE EGREGIOUS VIOLATION SECTION. IS A SUBSET OF WHAT ARE CALLED WILLFUL VIOLATIONS AND EITHER ONE OR THE EMPLOYER. KNOWINGLY VIOLATED THE LAW OR KNEW THAT THERE WAS A HAZARD THAT COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS AND DIDN'T MAKE ANY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THAT. AND THIS IS A SUBSET OF THOSE LOCAL VIOLATIONS. OF LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE ONLY CITED- LAST YEAR I THINK THERE WERE TWO AND THE- BEFORE THERE WERE THREE. AND OR TALKING ABOUT A SUBSET OF THOSE IN THE EXTREME CASE SOME OF WHICH WE'VE SEEN DURING. NINETEEN WHEN AN EMPLOYER IT IS FAILING TO TAKE ACTION THAT COULD SAVE LOTS OF WORKERS LIVES. YEAH THE QUICK POINT WE WANTED TO REALLY EMPHASIZE WHAT'S THAT. SECTION OF THE BILL THAT ALLOWS COALITION TO FIGHT TO THE LABOR CODE. GIVES THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORITY TO WEIGH IN ON WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY WHEN NECESSARY JEFF. CURRENTLY CAL OSHA INSPECTORS ONLY ENFORCE TITLE IN HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS. AND THE REALLY ISN'T ANYONE THERE TO ENFORCE THE LAW WHEN THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO STEP IN QUICKLY. TO DEAL WITH WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES THAT STILL GIVES THE LEGISLATURE THAT AUTHORITY WHICH WE THINK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. ALL RIGHT.

ONE SEVEN HERTZBERG SB SEVEN SEVEN FOUR WE'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO GET SETTLED. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MUCH. MEMBERS MISTER CHAIR PAULA JUDGES AND CLEATS COMMITTEE IT'S THE CONJUGAL FEW THINGS I'M SO SORRY SO HERE'S THE THIS THIS THIS BILL HAS BEEN EITHER A THE REASON I'VE BEEN REDUCED IT IS BECAUSE- THE COURT OF APPEALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARONIE ASLI DECIDED THE CASE. ON JANUARY TWENTIETH THE CASE IS CALLED WOOD VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY LITERALLY JUST ON JANUARY TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE FOURTH DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS. WHICH HELD A PUBLISHED DECISION THAT THE- FOR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ACT ADMINISTERED BY THE- FOR EMPLOYMENT AND THAT HIGH HOUSING DEPARTMENT BASICALLY SAID THAT- A SOMEBODY WHO SUBJECT TO COMPLAINT- COULDN'T BE REPRESENTING REP NOT REPRESENT YOURSELF DIDN'T HAVE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. AND THE REASON HAS WE HAVE UNDER THE EOC AND OTHER FEDERAL LACKS IN THE LIKE THIS ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE SHOULD EXIST BETWEEN THE AGENCY ON THE ONE HAND AND THE INDIVIDUAL ON THE OTHER IS BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE INVESTIGATORS TO PRESENTING THEIR CASE. THE PERSON WHO'S BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IS THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST AND SO THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS CLARIFYING LAW HERE AND BASICALLY CHALLENGING THE COURT IN THE WORST CASE THAT WAS A RONI ASTLEY DECIDED TO MAKE IT CLEAR. THAT IN THESE CASES THAT- THIS ATTORNEY CLIENT RIVILEGE PROTECTS THIS PRO BONO UP PERSON. YOU KNOW THE- THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ACT WAS STARTED CREATED NINETEEN FIFTY NINE- BY BOTH WILLIAM MUMFORD GUS HAWKINS TWO AFRICAN AMERICAN MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE TO THE OTHER HOUSE OF THIS LEGISLATURE. ITS PURPOSE WAS TO PROTECT PEOPLE CIVIL RIGHTS LIKE THE EOC IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE SINGLE LARGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY THE DOES THAT. AND SO THIS CASE BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT THIS LAW BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT CORRECTING THIS RONI IS CASE BECAUSE YOU NEED WHEN PEOPLE ARE APPEARING PRO BONO YOU NEED THEM TO HAVE A COMPLETE COMFORT LEVEL WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY PROVIDE IS CONFIDENTIAL IN THE IT WOULD CASE IT WAS ACTUALLY AN EMAIL THAT WAS PROVIDED. AND THE OTHER SIDE WAS TRYING TO GET DISCOVERY SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL THAT SIMPLIFICATION TO ONE PAGE BILL BUT OFTEN A WIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OR WHEN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. IMPROPERLY INTERPRETS THE LAW IT'S OUR DECISION OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN OUR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO CLARIFY THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE I HAVE ADAM AMERO. WHO IS WITH THE AGENCY WHO IS HERE AS A WITNESS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES YOU'RE RIGHT. THANK YOU SIR. HERTZBERG MR AMERILA ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YEAH IT COULD HAPPEN CHAIR AMBER HONORABLE MEMBERS. I AM NOT AMERICA. DIRECTOR OF EXECUTIVE PROGRAMS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ALSO KNOWN AS E. S. T. H. THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT SPONSORING THIS BILL AND DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON IT BUT I'M HERE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THIS BILL CLARIFIED THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW THE LAWYER CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND CATCHES THE CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE FDA TO LAWYERS AND INDIVIDUAL TO COME TO OUR DEPARTMENT ALLEGING THAT THE DOUBLE THAT THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY SHIELDED FROM DISCOVERY TO PROMOTE FULL AND OPEN DISCUSSION BETWEEN DLPH LAWYERS AND VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION. JUST THAT THE PRIVILEGE PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN DEFENDANTS AND OUR CASES AND THEIR COUNSEL. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING AND AGREED TO PERSON WHO COMES TO OUR DEPARTMENT IT'S NOT OUR CLIENT THE DEPARTMENT IF THE CLIENT OF OUR LAWYERS. BUT IF YOU HAVE KIDS I PICKED THEM UP DISCRIMINATION AND EXPRESSED ROLE IN A CAGE FREE BRING ON THEIR BEHALF. THEY ARE THE REAL PARTY IN IT IN TRANSIT CENTER HERTZBERG GETS NOTED AND. INTERVENE IN OUR CASE. SCHERING PLOUGH. THE CIVIL RIGHTS CAME HE BEACH LAWYER NOT COME. BUT THE REAL PARTY ABOUT CONFIDENTIAL LEGAL. SICKENING ARE NOW FOR D. F. H. IMPORT THE STATE PUBLIC POWER. ARE RADICALLY NEEDING AND REMEDYING DISCRIMINATION IN OUR STATE. THE REASON DECISION FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL IN WOODBRIDGE TO SUPERIOR COURT AND CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL CONFUSION THAT IS DEALING EXTENDED LITIGATION OVER THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWYER CLIENT PRIVILEGE TO OUR DEPARTMENT'S LAWYERS COMMUNICATIONS BUT THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST. YOUR UNDERMINING AND RAISING THE COST OF THE STATE CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM THE BILL RECALLS BACK CONFUSION. THE SENATOR HERTZBERG JUST NOTE THAT BILL ALL ONLINE STATE FEDERAL LAW FEDERAL COURTS HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED THAT THE LAWYER CLIENT PRIVILEGE PROTECTS COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN COMPLAINANTS AND FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. SHOULD BE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NOT AN ATTORNEY CLIENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THEY'RE COMPLAINING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU MR ROMERO ON OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I SEE NO ONE IN THE GALLERY I SEE NO ONE IN THE ROOM ONE TWELVE.

ALL RIGHT MADAM MODERATOR- LET LET'S BRING IT BACK HERE TO THE CHAMBER THERE'S NO ONE ON THE LINE I SEE THAT CENTER BOARD JUST HIS MICROPHONE RAISED AN INCIDENT WHAT KELSEY DOES AS WELL SO WE'LL GO CENTER FOR JUST FOR. THANK YOU. GERMAN MY KNEE JERK REACTION- TO EXPANDING THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE- IS ONE OF HESITATION THIS THIS- COMMITTEE I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST YEAR MAYBE THE YEAR BEFORE DEALT WITH A SIMILAR SITUATION WHERE ATTORNEY CLIENT PROTECTIONS WERE SOUGHT FOR MEMBERS OF A- COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ORGANIZATION- TO FACILITATE THE- DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN- MEMBER AND- COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LEADERSHIP. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A NEED AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT NEED THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE. WITH FOLKS. IN GET SOME DEGREE OF INFORMATION. WHILE MINIMIZING THE RISK OF SUCH DISCLOSURES IN THAT PROCESS. MY CONCERN HERE IT GOES BACK TO WHAT WE EXPERIENCED- WITH OF WITH AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS TYPE OF BILL IS WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF EXPANDING ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. AND I THINK THE AUTHOR IN A MINUTE IF I IF I MAY POSE A QUESTION OR TWO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO THE AUTHOR. IS THAT. THE SAN DIEGO COURT OF APPEALS DECISION. I HAD OCCASION TO READ IT LAST NIGHT- I THINK IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT PRETTY TELLING. THE COURT OF PPEALS IN THIS SUBJECT MATTER. IDENTIFIED THAT ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE IS DESIGNED INHERENTLY TO BE BETWEEN ONE AN ATTORNEY NUMBER TWO A CLIENT WITH THE EXPECTATION OF PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICE THROUGH THAT RELATIONSHIP. HERE I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS ASKING FOR US TO DO AWAY WITH THE CONDITION PRECEDENT THAT THERE BE. ONE AN ATTORNEY AND TO A CLIENT. IN THIS SITUATION THE DEPARTMENT OF- HOUSING- FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. SERVES THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS NOT SERVE AS AN ATTORNEY OR LEGAL ADVISER TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS- PRESENTING INFORMATION PRESENTING POTENTIALLY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. BECAUSE THERE'S NO FORESEEABLE NEXUS BETWEEN THAT CLIENT IN THAT DEPARTMENT LEGAL ADVISER THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THEM TO PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICE TO THAT INDIVIDUAL. SO MY CONCERN IS THAT IF WE KNOW BASED ON THE SAME DAY OF COURT OF APPEALS DECISION. THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO REACHES OUT TO A DEPARTMENT WHERE THERE WILL NEVER EVER BE A FIDUCIARY DUTY OR EXPECTATION OF. PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICE IF WE EXPANDED TOURNEY CLIENT PROTECTIONS TO THAT. THEN I THINK. THAT WOULD BE A KITTEN TO AN INDIVIDUAL REACHING OUT TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. ASKING FOR INTERNET CLIENT. COMMUNICATION WHEN THE DA'S OFFICE OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE LOOKS AFTER THE INTERESTS OF THE WHOLE OF THE STATE NOT THE INDIVIDUAL. SO THERE'S A THERE'S A WE USE AT ALL FOR A SLIPPERY SLOPE I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS VERY COMPELLING STATE CONSEQUENCES THAT WE COULD FORESEE HERE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR. IS I'D LIKE TO HEAR AN EXPLANATION AS TO HOW THIS WOULD BE CONFINED IF THIS BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD THAT WOULDN'T BE EXPANDED UPON IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE IN SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATIVE CYCLES. WE'RE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE SEEKING INFORMATION AND THEN WE GIVE THEM BEING GIVEN ATTORNEY CLIENT PROTECTIONS WHEN THEY WILL NEVER EVER BE A CLIENT. IF I COULD POSE THAT QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR HERTZBERG WHICH LIKE THE QUESTION REPEATED NO I GOT IT I GOT IT ALL RIGHT- HERTZBERG. YOU CAN RESPOND OR IN YOUR CLOTHES OUR RESPONSE IN THIS MAY BE MY CLOTHES HOPE LIVES NO MORE QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE PUBLIC INTEREST. IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE WE DECIDED IN THIS STATE THAT WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S CIVIL RIGHTS. THAT WE WERE GOING TO CREATE A STATE AGENCY TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL CIVIL RIGHTS THAT IS THE PUBLIC INTEREST. QUESTION BECOMES JUST LIKE THE E. O. C. WHERE I'VE HAD A RELATIVE WHO USED TO BE THE CHAIRMAN OF THAT. UNDER BOTH NIXON AND FORD. THE AMBASSADOR. THIS SAME MODEL APPLIANCE SO WHAT WE HAVE IS A PERSON WHO CIVIL RIGHTS HAS BEEN VIOLATED THE QUESTION AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THAT IS INFORMED BY A LONG HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITHOUT ABUSE SIR A PROCESS ISSUES OF WHAT. SHOULD THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE MEANS IS THAT WE NEED THIS CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN OUR AGENCY WHOSE JOB IT IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS ARTICULATED THIS WAS EXPRESSED OUR WITNESS TO BE THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST. THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST IN CASES IS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE THESE CASES IT'S LIKE HAVING A WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM OR VICTIM RIGHTS PROGRAM IN THE PEOPLE VERSUS AN INDIVIDUAL TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING. BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW DO YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONFIDENTIALITY OTHERWISE YOU COULD NEVER PROSECUTED CASE SO YOU COULD GET CAUGHT UP IN THE MEETING AND I DON'T THINK THE ANSWERS WITH RESPECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IT ALL APPLIES TO THIS DIAGNOSTIC. BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THIS WORKS IS NOT EXPANSION THIS IS A CLARIFICATION THAT IS WAS INDICATED BY THEIR TECHNICAL ADVISER IS NECESSARY BY THE CONFUSION CREATED BY THE COURT IN SAN DIEGO. AND IT IS ALSO AS A FINAL POINT RATE THIS IS NOT INVENTING SOMETHING NEW THIS IS NOT A BROAD EXPANSION OF WHAT WE MEAN BY ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. THIS IS SIMPLY WHAT HAS BEEN TRIED IN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE ONLY REASON I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY IS BECAUSE ONE COURT IN SAN DIEGO MADE A DECISION TO VERY A VERY AWAY FROM THAT. AND THAT THIS. T. THAT CREATED IN. FIFTY NINE IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT PEOPLE CIVIL RIGHTS COULD CONTINUE TO DO SO. I THINK THAT REALLY ADDRESSES IT SHOWS THAT ITS MAINSTAY THIS IS NOT SOME ABERRATION BUT ISN'T SOME WILD. INTERPRETATION OF WHAT WE MEAN THAT IN FACT THE REAL INTERPRETATION IT WAS PROBLEMATIC WHAT IS IN THE WORST CASE ON JANUARY TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU. SURE IF I COULD FOLLOW UP. YES GO HEAD TO THE BOARD THANK YOU- AND I AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE REAL MERITS TO LOOKING AFTER THE PUBLIC GOOD. BUT THERE MUST BE MECHANISMS THAT COULD BE CREATED THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR CONFIDENTIAL ASK. PROTECTIONS FOR COMMUNICATIONS WITHOUT MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF. ATTORNEY CLIENT PROTECTIONS IN PRIVILEGE. WOULD THAT NOT BE A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. TO THE CHAIR MR IS THE QUESTION I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T SEE WHY. BECAUSE WE HAVE A LONG BODY OF THE HISTORY OF THE BODY OF LAW OF WHAT IT MEANS I GET YOUR POINT WE COULD CREATE SOME HYBRID. SOME NEW KIND OF MODEL THAT SAYS WELL THIS ISN'T TECHNICALLY ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE BUT WE WOULD BE LITIGATING THIS FROM HERE TO THE HEAVENS. WE HAVE A PRINCIPLE IT IT ONLY APPLIES ONE WAY IT'S ONLY FOR ONE LIMITED PURPOSE. AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME PROCESS. THAT HAS BEEN IN THE LAW ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR MANY YEARS WITH THE- THE EEOC THE COMPLIMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION. WHICH HAS A SIMILAR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT PEOPLE CIVIL RIGHTS. I WOULD SAY YOU MIGHT HAVE A POINT. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT IT'S BEEN IN THE LAW FOR A LONG TIME ONE COURT CASE CAME DOWN. THROUGH SOME CONFUSION. OUR JOB IN THIS BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT IS TO CLARIFY THAT COMPETED TECH INFUSION AND MAKE SURE. THAT THE WAY THE LAW SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AND THAT IS TO PROTECT THE LITTLE GUY WHO SCARED TO DEATH WHOSE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED AND NEEDS EVERY PROTECTION POSSIBLE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT THERE DOES NO CHILLING EFFECT ON THEIR ABILITY TO COME FORTH TO EXPLAIN. AND STAND UP FOR THEIR BREACH OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. INJUSTICE CLARIFICATION AND JUSTICE CLARIFICATION- IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS- CONTEXT. THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE. IS THE GOVERNMENT. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. THE GUY. OKAY SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB IS A PUBLIC POLCY TO THE CHAIR. IS TO PROTECT. CIVIL RIGHTS THAT'S EIGHT STATED CRITICAL DEVELOP PURPOSE OF OUR LAW IN CALIFORNIA FOR SEVENTY YEARS SIXTY YEARS. THAT'S THEY HOLD THAT THAT'S AND THEY NEED TO HOLD IT TO GIVE THE PERSON CONFIDENCE SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE WOULD BE THE- DIVISION OF THE STATE AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL- YEAH. SO IN A TREE CLIENT PRIVILEGE. THE CLIENT HOLDS THE PRIVILEGE. SO THIS IS NOT ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE IS NOT THE PRINCIPLE AND WHAT THE INSTRUMENT MEANING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR THE EOC OR THE- ANY VARIATION OF THE DIVISION OF THE STATE. HOW DOES HOW DO YOU RECONCILE US GENERAL DURING THE PRIVILEGES NOT MATTER THAT'S THAT'S A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE SENATOR THAT'S A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN SERVE ITS PURPOSE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GETTING HURT CAN BE COULD HAVE COMFORT. THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE UP THEIR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PREPARE THEIR CASE IS GOING TO BE ADVERSELY USED AGAINST THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT'S PURPOSE IS GOING TO BE SERVED AND SO IT'S AN ARGUMENT WHERE THEORETICALLY YOU CAN SAY WELL AS I GUESS THE MOST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT. THE DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIALITY IS STEEPED IN THE LAW SO THAT THERE'S NO RISK TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU INVENTED SOME NEW THEORY BUT THAT THEY KNOW THAT THIS DEFINITION IS GOIG TO PROTECT THEM ALL RIGHT AND I NINE ONCE AGAIN I ABSOLUTELY RESPECT MY COLLEAGUE- BOARD MELANIE QUESTIONS. IN ALL FINISHED RIGHT HERE CHAIR THANK YOU IS THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ARE WHEN IT COMES TO ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE THE HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE. IS DETERMINATIVE. AND IF THIS A HEALTH AND SAY MATTER FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE COMES FORWARD WITH THE HEALTH VIOLATION ALLEGATION AGAINST A RESTAURANT YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS TYPE OF ATTORNEY CLIENT ASK PROTECTION WE'LL BELIEVE NOT MAYBE THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE BUT IT WILL MOVE FORWARD- IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK IT WOULD DILUTE THE ESSENCE OF AN ATTORNEY AND A CLIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EXPECTATION OF LEGAL SERVICE- SO.

GOING BACK TO TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE EVEN HAD A REPAIR REPUBLICAN LED EFFORT BY CENTER FIGHT ACT ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. THIS BILL. MORE WORK ALONG SAME AREAS ASKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO ENACT A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM THE TIMES NOW WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT OF AMERICA CALIFORNIA- REALLY THAT OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY MOVE FORWARD ON SOMETHING THAT IS IN OUR BEST INTERESTS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED ELEVEN MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALL CALIFORNIA HOME. TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CONTRIBUTE TO.

TWO SEVENTY EIGHT IS A REINTRODUCTION OF SB TWO SIXTY SIX WHICH WAS PASSED BY THIS HOUSE IN THE ASSEMBLY WAS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT HOWEVER WAS PULLED BACK FROM ENGROSSING AND ENROLLING IN THE HOPES OF NEGOTIATING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE NOT ABLE TO HAPPEN THEREFORE WE RE INTRODUCED AND HAVE TO SEVENTY EIGHT THIS IS BONE THIS IS PROTECTS PROMISED AND PAID FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF CALPERS MEMBERS BY MAKING SURE NO HARM COMES TO A RETIREE. FOR ANY COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED PENSION COMPENSATION THAT WAS REPORTED TO THE SYSTEM THIS MAJOR RESPONSE TO CASES IN WHICH PENSIONABLE COMPENSATION OF RETIRED EMPLOYEES AS RECTOR RETROACTIVELY DEEMED DISALLOWED BY CALPERS IN THESE INSTANCES THE RETIRED EMPLOYEES ARE FORCED TO PAY BACK THE TOTAL OVERPAID AMOUNT AS WELL SUFFER PERMANENT REDUCTIONS IN THEIRPENSION. MOST RETIREES LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED CUTS TO THEIR BENEFITS CERTAINLY AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN LONG AFTER THEY HAVE RETIRED SB TWO SEVENTY EIGHTS GIVES RETIREES IMPORTANT PEACE OF MIND THAT THE RETIREMENT THAT THEY EARNED AND PAID FOR OVER A LIFE OF PUBLIC SERVICE WILL CONSISTENTLY BE. THERE THROUGHOUT THE RETIREMENT YEARS. SPECIFICALLY THIS IS A PROCESS FOR CALPERS AND EMPLOYERS TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT RETIREE BENEFITS AND PREVENT THESE INSTANCES FROM EVER HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. SB TWO SEVENTY EIGHT ALSO COMPELS EMPLOYERS TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE TO RETIREES AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM ANY REDUCTIONS TO THE RETIREMENT AS A RESULT OF DISALLOWED COMPENSATION. SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS DOUG SUPERS WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WHEN APPROPRIATE MEMBERS AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE. THEY SAY LEYVA THE STEAMERS. THANK YOU MISTER JUSTIN WAS IN THE GALLERY THANK YOU GO AHEAD SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS- DOUG SERVERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONOR SB TWO SEVEN NAME LIKE TO THANK CENTER LEYVA FOR HER ONGOING WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE- DETAILED ANALYSIS. THIS ISSUE FIRST CAME TO THE C. P. F. ONE A FIREFIGHTER EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OF DAVIS- RETIRED AFTER SERVING NEARLY THIRTY THIRTY YEARS- SERVING THE PUBLIC FOR THIRTY YEARS- AFTER FIVE YEARS OF RETIREMENT CALPERS NOTIFIED THE- RETIRED FIREFIGHTER. THAT OKAY ITEM THAT WAS SUBMITTED BY THE CITY OF DAVIS WAS DETERMINED TO BE DISALLOWED CONSEQUENTLY CALPERS- SOUGHT TO. SEEK REIMBURSEMENTFOR THE OVERPAYMENT NOT FROM THE CITY OF DAVIS WHO HAD BARGAINED THE SPECIAL COMPENSATION ITEM BUT FROM THE RETIRED FIREFIGHTER- THE REIMBURSEMENTS OFF I CALPERS INCLUDED A LUMP SUM OF FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE- FIREFIGHTERS PAY GOING FORWARD. GOING FORWARD LIKE MANY RETIREES ON A FIREFIGHTER A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEE RETIRE THEY RELY ON THEIR- PENSION FOR THEIR DAY TO DAY- INCOME NEEDS. UNLIKE MANY PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHERS OFTENTIMES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SECURE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS MAKING THIS- THEIR PENSION THEIR ONLY SOURCE OF INCOME IN RETIREMENT. THIS BILLS EXPERT TO PROTECT THE RETIREE BY ENSURING THAT A BENEFIT THAT WAS BARGAINED FOR IS MAINTAINED AND THE SITUATION THAT HAPPENED TO THE DAVIS FIREFIGHTER DOESN'T HAPPEN TO FUTURE RETIREES. EXISTING LAW AND CALPERS REGULATION HAS ESTABLISHED RULES AROUND THESE CATEGORIES OF COMPENSATION EXAMPLES OF THE COMPENSATION OUR LONGEVITY PAY HAZARD PAY EDUCATIONAL INCENTIVE PAY AND EXAMPLES OF THE RULES OR- THINGS LIKE THAT TYPE OF THAT SPECIFIC COMPENSATION ITEM NEEDS TO BE OFFERED TO THE ENTIRE RIVER CLASS. IF THESE COMPENSATION ITEMS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED A REPORTED CORRECTLY WE COULD FIND A SITUATION WHERE PAY ITEM IS DISALLOWED BY THE SYSTEM AND THE RETIREE NEEDS TO- BEAR THE BURDEN OF THAT OVERPAYMENT OR FUTURE REDUCTION. GENERATIONS OF HARD WORKING MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA'S MIDDLE CLASS OF DEDICATED THEIR CAREERS THIS PUBLIC SERVICE OFTEN ARE EARNING LESS OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREERS- THEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR- COUNTERPARTS- TO EARN AND PAY FOR THE PROMISE OF A SECURE RETIREMENT. WE BELIEVE SB TWO SEVEN EIGHT IS IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROTECT THE PROMISE OF THAT SECURE RETIREMENT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE ARRIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU THE SEWERS AS ARE ONLY IN PERSON WITNESS HERE TODAY WE APPRECIATE YOU CHANGING. IT UP FOR US. ALL RIGHT. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT- PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

IS TRULY UNFORTUNATE RETIREES HAVE THE PENSIONS CUT OFF THEIR OWN WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO FIGHT READY THIS WELL THAT THE FACT THAT TAKEN TO PREVENT IT FROM EVER HAPPENING. IN THE FIRST PLACE. I IF YOU CHOOSE YOU BOB YOU RECORD IT REMEDY AT THIS. FOR MAKING RETIREES PENSIONS ARE ALL. ONE CAL SIX STEPS TO DISALLOW. BENEFITS BECAUSE THE BENEFITS BY LATE LAW HOW ARE TO PAY TO VIOLATE THE LAW THANK A FEW. SHE BE UNABLE TO PAY FOR A PENSION BENEFITS PROBABLY THE LAW.

THANK YOU SIR- NEXT WE'LL MOVE TO MISTER BIJAN MAY ARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DETER ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WE REGRETFULLY HAVE TO CONTINUE OPPOSING THIS MEASURE TODAY AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER GIVENS NOTED WE HAVE DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS MEASURE WOULD MEAN. FOR US AND FOR THE STABILITY OF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS MEASURE WOULD EFFECTIVELY ALLOW AN END RUN AROUND. IN CREATE A MORAL HAZARD TO PUBLIC AGENCIES BECAUSE THEY COULD PUT WHATEVER THEY WANT IN THE DEMO YOU KNOWING THAT IT COULD BE CIRCUMVENT THAT AT ANY POINT NAY TO CONTINUE MAKING. THOSE PAYMENTS BEYOND THAT WE ALSO FEEL INCREDIBLY STRONGLY THAT MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED FROM CALPERS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MO USE ARE CERTIFIED RYAN WITH THE PEARL AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE MISTAKES DON'T HAPPEN. WE SHARE THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT RETIREES ARE PROTECTED HOWEVER PLATING THE FISCAL LIABILITY ON PUBLIC AGENCIES FOR BENEFITS THAT THEY NEGOTIATED IN GOOD FAITH BECAUSE DETERMINATION BUT ARE MADE BY CALPERS. IT WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN OUR ADMINISTRATION AND IN OUR FISCAL CONDITION GIVEN WHERE WE ARE BECAUSE OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND ENDEMIC INDUCED RECESSION. WE SIMPLY REQUEST MORE TIME TO WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE NEED. ADDITIONALLY WE DO FEEL STRONGLY THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LEGAL QUESTION THAT CAN BE RAISED. BECAUSE OF THE PAYMENT AND WHETHER OR NOT HELP- THE DETERMINING OF THE DISALLOWED COMPENSATION MAKE THEM ILLEGAL AND WHETHER WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS WE KNOW THAT IT'S AN ISSUE. OF LEGAL DISAGREEMENT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO MORE CONVERSATION BUT AGAIN WE DO THINK MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE MISTAKES ARE MADE IN THE FUTURE AND PUBLIC AGENCIES AREN'T BUT HOLDING THE BAG FOR MISTAKES THAT CALPERS MAKE.

I SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO THANK TIM GRIFFIN'S PRETEND GRIFFIS I'M SORRY WAS HELPLESS CRAP NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AND AS I'LL DISCUSS I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSING ANALYSIS THANK YOU SENATOR- SB THREE NINETY ONE AUTHORIZES COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT. BOARDS TO SAFELY MEET VIA TELECONFERENCE OR VIDEOCONFERENCE DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS ANISH INSURERS THAT FAIR PARTICIPATION IN THESE MEETINGS IS ACCESSIBLE TO MEMBERS. AS YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW THE DAVIS STERLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT REQUIRES THE ID'S TO PROVIDE A PHYSICAL MEETING LOCATION FOR ALL MEETINGS- WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE CAN POSE SIGNIFICANT RISKS DURING EMERGENCIES I LIKE THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC OR. ANY NUMBER THE WILDFIRES WE FACE RECENTLY. LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE THE COMPANY PANDEMIC THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES. TO MEET AND VOTE REMOTELY GET AND SO FAR NO SIMILAR ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR HOAS. CONSEQUENTLY HOAS HAVE FACED IMMENSE DIFFICULTIES IN ORGANIZING LAWFUL MEETINGS IN THE MIDST OF THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. FROM LAST YEAR A TWO WAYS OF FOUND THE ORGANIZING IN PERSON MEETINGS CURRENTLY REQUIRED UNDER EXISTING LAWS. HAS OFTEN BEEN IMPRACTICABLE SANSEI FOR EVEN ILLEGAL. IN RESPONSE TO THIS THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION WORK LAST FALL TO CRAFT A NARAL POLICY RECOMMENDATION. THAT SIMPLY WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE AN IN PERSON MEETING LOCATION FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MEETINGS- DURING A DECLARED EMERGENCY OR DISASTER AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE A NARROW EXCEPTION. TO ENSURE PARTICIPATION IS ACCESSIBLE MEMBER THIS BILL REQUIRES THE ID'S TO FULFILL THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS. THEY MUST PROVIDE CLEAR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PARTICIPATE. THE MEETING NOTICE MUST INCLUDE THE TELEPHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL OF A PERSON WHO CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE TELECONFERENCE PROCESS. BOTH BEFORE AND DURING THE MEETING. THEY MUST ENSURE THAT EVERY DIRECTOR AND MEMBER HAS THE SAME ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEETING. THAT WOULD EXIST IF THE MEETING ARE HELD IN PERSON. ANY VOTER THE DIRECTOR SHALL BE CONDUCTED BY ROLL CALL. AND LASTLY PARTISAN IT SHALL BE GIVEN THE OPTION OF PARTICIPATING BY TELEPHONE. NOW DURING THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THIS BILL A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WERE RAISED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF ELECTIONS. ARE ELECTIONS- FOR H. AWAY BOARDS FOR EXAMPLE. TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS WE ARE ACCEPTING A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS- THE STATE THAT SPECIFICALLY HOAS MUST GENERALLY PROVIDE PHYSICAL LOCATIONS FOR MEMBERS OBSERVE. AND INSPECT THE ACCOUNT ELECTION BALLOTS EVEN DURING A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY OR DISASTER UNLESS. THE THERE IS- EIGHTY EIGHT THANK YOU AND SITUATION WHERE- PHYSICAL HUMAN PROXIMITY IS DANGEROUS OR IMPRACTICAL. AND SO THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IS THAT THE DECLARED OR PROCLAIM DISASTER EMERGENCY MAKES IT UNSAFE OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO GATHER IN PERSON IN ORDER TO COUNT AND TABULATE BALLOTS UNDER THOSE NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES- IN PERSON COUNTING AND OBSERVATION MAY BE WAIVED BUT WE ARE STILL REQUIRING THAT VIDEO OBSERVATION IS REQUIRED. WE'RE ALSO ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT ANY VIOLATIONS OF THIS BILL SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME VIOLATION. ENFORCEMENT COMMON INTERESTS AND BUILD AN OPEN MEETINGS ACT. AND THE PRIOR TO NATURE WAYS FIRST VIRTUAL MEETING THEY MUST SEND AN EMAIL NOTIFICATION OF MEMBERS WHEN MAIL SERVICE WILL NOT ACHIEVE ACTUAL NOTICE. PLEASE ALL FURTHER CLARIFY THE CENTRAL ISSUE THIS BILL SEEKING TO ADDRESS THAT UR CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ANTICIPATE OR PROVIDE. CONTINGENCIES FOR FAIR AND SAFE PARTICIPATION H. O. IN MEETINGS DURING EMERGENCIES OF THE KIND WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF IN THE LAST YEAR. MODIFIERS THE GLOBAL CAN'T ANNEX RECENT EMERGENCIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE OR SAFE. FOR SENSATIONS TO PROVIDE IN PERSON MEETING LOCATIONS AND THAT IS WHY SB THREE NINETY ONE A PERMISSIVE BILL THAT SIMPLY GIVES YOU IDEAS ANOTHER OPTION FOR MEETING. AGAIN DURING THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES OFFICIALLY DECLARE EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS IS SO URGENTLY NEEDED. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFIED BRIAN HAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW COMMISSION AND- HATCHELL A. COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION ATTORNEYS MARC COUNTY. THANK YOU SIR MAY IS A EBERLE THE PHONE. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS QUIEN BRAIN HUBERT I'M THE DIRECTOR LAW REVISION COMMISSION- I'M HERE TODAY JUST TO HELP EXPLAIN THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS HAVE ABOUT IT- THE ONLY POINT I WOULD ADD TO- SENATOR MEN'S EXPLANATION. IS THAT THE COMMISSION INCLUDED IN ITS RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS BE INTRODUCED AS AN URGENCY BILL AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE HEARD- RELIABLE ANECDOTAL ACCOUNTS BUT A LOT OF THE ID'S DURING THE PANDEMIC WE'RE GOING AHEAD AND HOLDING TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS WITHOUT A PHYSICAL LOCATION. REALLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY ALTERNATIVE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE DURING THE EMERGENCY. AND SO THEY HAVE SORT OF EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO POTENTIAL LITIGATION CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THEIR ACTIONS AT THOSE MEETINGS THAT WERE TECHNICALLY OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND SO WE WANTED TO PROPOSE A CHANGE. THAT COULD HOPEFULLY BE- INTRODUCED AND ENACTED IN TAKE THE MEDIA FACT- SO THAT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL CHANGES COULD GO INTO EFFECT RIGHT AWAY AND LET US SEE IDEAS GET ONTO A LEGITIMATE. FLOODING FOR THEIR MEETINGS GOING FORWARD. I HAVE ANY OTHER TO A- THANK YOU MISTER- ALSO MISTER DIRK- CHILL. YES. I'M BURGEONING HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'M I'M A CALIFORNIA TURNING INTO MY FIRM WE REPRESENT MANY HUNDREDS OF COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS ARE C. ID RANGING IN SIZE FROM JUST UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SIX STATE HOME- JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND WITH THE CLICK ON TO THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE SAW MANY C. ID STATES WITH REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. HAS ALREADY REFERENCE THE OPEN MEETING ACT EXPRESSLY REQUIRES THAT THE BOARD- PROVIDE A PHYSICAL LOCATION FOR BOARD MEETINGS HOWEVER AS WE ALL KNOW VERY STATE AND LOCAL LAWS TO MANDATE PROHIBIT GATHERING THAT THAT PHYSICAL LOCATION AND EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T TECHNICALLY PROHIBITED VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS RESIDENT PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT ALL THAT SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HOLDING PHYSICAL LOCATIONS OPEN FOR MEETING SO AT A VERY CRITICAL TIME ADDED A VERY BUSY TIME IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS TO DO THEIR JOB. SO AT THAT TIME BY NECESSITY TO BROWN ACT OTHER LAWS FAIRLY QUICKLY MOVED IN ASSISTED IN AND THE CONTINUATION OF STATE COUNTY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER WITH RESPECT TO SEE AIDID'S WE SAW NO SUCH RELIEF FOR THEIR VOLUNTEER LEADERS AND MEMBERS SO THAT SAID. AS WAS JUST MENTIONED EVEN WITHOUT THE CHANGE TO THE LOCKER SAID THESE MANY COMMUNITIES DRIVEN BY THAT SAYING THAT THAT'S THE BEGAN CONDUCTING OPEN MEETINGS WITHOUT PHYSICAL LOCATIONS AND IT QUICKLY. THE TREND CONTINUED ACROSS THE STATE. THIS ENABLED. ATTENDANCE FOR HOME PHONE OR- THE NEW THE RESIDENTS ARE BOARDING NEEDED LEAVE THEIR REPAIR SUPPORT. IT PROTECTED THE- IN THE COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS FROM EXPOSURE TO COLD AT NINETEEN WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT ARE AGE RESTRICTED COMMUNITY HAD ENABLED COMMUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AT THE CRITICAL TIME WHEN THE FAMILIES WERE STICKING CLOSE TO HOME. MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. IN THE END IT WAS OBSERVED BY EVERYBODY IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT THIS TRANSITION DRAMATICALLY INCREASE COMMUNITY MEMBER INVOLVEMENT AND COMMUNICATION THE LEVELS OF THE NEVER EVEN BEEN SEEN BEFORE- BUT- THIS MORNING I SPOKE TO THE- COMMITTEE LEADERS INTO VERY LARGE AGE RESTRICTED COMMUNITIES HERE INORANGE COUNTY.

SH NO THERE'S NO NOTHING Q. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR DOES NO ONE ELSE IN Q. WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK HERE THE CHAMBER I SEE MISTER HERTZBERG'S MICROPHONE OFFICE HERTZBERG. THANK YOU. WHICH WAS LAST FRIDAY CHAIRMAN- MY STAFF SAID TO ME A EMAIL. FROM A VERY SATISFIED CONSTITUENT- THANK IN OUR OFFICE FOR WORKING HARD TO HELP THEM GET A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT UNDER THE PROGRAM WE RECENTLY PASSED. SO I CALLED UP THAT PERSON. TO THANK THEM FOR SENDING A NOTE. SO OFTEN THIS WE IN PUBLIC SERVICE WE ONLY GET FOLKS ARE ANGRY AND I WANTED TO JUST THANK. THIS PERSON FOR HER GRACIOUSNESS. IN THE CONVERSATION SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE'S HAVING A BIG PROBLEM. THAT SHE LIVES IN A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WITH ABOUT EIGHTY- FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT THE BOARD ASSESSED HER TOO MUCH MONEY AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. AND I STARTED SKING HER ABOUT IT AND WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW TO THE CURRENT SHE AID. WELL BUT YOU KNOW THEY HAD A VIDEO MEETING ASSUME MEETING OR WHATEVER. THIS IS FORTY PEOPLE OF OUR HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION DON'T HAVE EMAILS THEY DON'T HAVE ZOOM IN OR ZOOM SCISSORS SENIORS. AND I SAID TO THEN GET NOTICE AND SO THAT THE ASSESSMENT THAT POSE SUCH A BURDEN ON HER AND HER HUSBAND- WAS EXTRAORDINARY. AND SO I LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS COMMITTEE PUT TOGETHER AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THE AUTHORS TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS. NUMBER VOTE FOR THIS TODAY IS AN ACCOMMODATION IN THE HOUSE OF ORIGIN TO MOVE ALONG. WITHOUT A COMMITMENT TO VOTE FOR ON THE FLOOR. AND I KNOW SOME OTHER MEMBERS HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH IT. BUT I GUESS IT'S JUST WHAT I WANTED TO SAY ON THE RECORD IS. YOU KNOW I'VE ENJOYED IN THIS ENOUGH AND I'VE LISTENED TO SOME OF THE TESTIMONY AND I. SHARED WITH- MISTER MAN STAFF THAT YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA RAISE THIS ISSUE- BUT I JUST THINK THAT WHEN YOU READ THIS STUFF. THAT THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT DECISIONS IT WAS MENTIONED. ED YOU'VE GOT IF YOU GOT SENIORS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. AND I GET WE'RE TRYING TO DO ZOOMS IN THE IN THIS AND THE AND THE- ASSESSMENT WAS AN EMERGENCY ASSESSMENT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC EXACTLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TALKING ABOUT. AND SHALL PUT TOGETHER A PETITION BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DUE PROCESS AND HALF THE PEOPLE OF THE ASSOCIATION NEVER EVEN KNEW DECISION WAS BEING MADE. SO I JUST THINK THAT AS WE ENGAGE IN THIS DISCUSSION. YES TO SOME MODERNIZATION IS NEEDED ON THE ONE HAND. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT HAS TO BE A DEEP SYMPATHY SENSITIVITY IF YOU WILL. TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE UP TO SPEED WITH ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND MAKE SURE THESE DECISIONS INCLUDE THEIR VOICE THAT'S ALL SO I WILL BE VOTING FOR TODAY I WANTED TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST. ABSOLUTELY BY HAPPENSTANCE. THAT THIS HAPPENED AND I WANTED TO SHARE THOSE OBSERVATIONS AND SENSITIVITIES AND I. THANK THE AUTHOR AND I. WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS AND CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MAJORITY- I SEE MISS WHITE HE SAID WHITE HOUSE. MR OF THE STATURE I HAVE A- QUESTION I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE THAT IT'S BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR- WHAT I'M NOT CLEAR ON IS THE NOTIFICATION. BY EMAIL. I UNDERSTAND. MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE EMAIL BUT SOMETIMES THESE. BOARDS HAVE THE EMAIL BUT THE PEOPLE SAY I WANT TO GET THE- PAPER COPY BECAUSE I'M- A RETIREE OR THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE MAIL. WINDIES EMERGENCIES ARE COMING IN. I DON'T THINK THE AMENDMENTS. REQUIRE THE- THE BOARD TO SEND OUT EMAILS TO EVERYBODY THAT THEY HAVE ME MAIL ON WHETHER THEY WANT THE NOTICE OR NOT. I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR THAT. IF THAT IF MY. UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CORRECT OR NOT CORRECT. THE COMMISSION ANSWER THAT- SENTIMENT I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER- SO MY UNDERSTANDING BILL I WILL REFER TO IT DEREK- ONE OF MY WITNESSES BUT- IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MODELED OFF OF EXISTING STATUTORY LANGUAGE UNDER THE CIVIL CODE SECTION FORTY FORTY- WHICH ALLOWS FOR EMAIL AS AN ALTERNATIVE IF THEY'VE OPTED IN AND SO THE PREFERRED METHOD IS MALE. IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN THEY WILL BE SENT BY EMAIL OR IF THE PERSON IS OPERATING THE EMAIL THEN THEY WILL SEND EMAIL- IF MAIL IS NOT POSSIBLE. FOR WHATEVER REASON THEN THEY WILL SEND EMAILS TO EVERYBODY THEY HAVE EMAILS ON FILE FOR- AND THAT'S JUST CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT PRACTICES WITH THE CODE BUT I'LL LET BURKE ANSWER THAT AS WELL. IT THIRTY THREE THE ACCOUNT DID YOU WANT TO HAVE THE- THE SPECTRAL RESPONSE YES PLEASE REFER. MISTER CASUALTY ARE ABLE TO RESPOND. THE MEASURE SHARED THAT THAT ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED AND- SUBSECTION C. OF THE PROPOSED FIFTY FOUR FIFTY AND IT DOES IT IS MODELED AFTER THE INDIVIDUAL NOTICE THAT IT SET OUT IN CIVIL CODE SECTION FORTY FORTY- BUT WHAT DID PROVIDED THAT WE ARE GOING TO ADD KNOW AS A LEAD YOU KNOW FURTHER UP IN THE STATUTE- PROPOSED. IT DOES SAY WE'RE GONNA GET INDIVIDUAL NOTICE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EMERGENCY- UNDER WHICH WE ARE GOING GOING TO BE USING THESE TYPES OF MEETINGS. AND IT GOES ON TO SAY IN SUBSECTION C. THAT IF AS A RESULT OF THE DISASTER EMERGENCY MAIL DELIVERY OR RETRIEVAL IS NOT POSSIBLE FROM THE GIVEN ADDRESS WITHIN AN ASSOCIATION THAT WE WILL PROVIDE THAT ALSO WE WILL PROVIDE THAT NOTICE BY EMAIL TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THAT OWNER TO THE ASSOCIATION. WITH ALREADY BUILT INTO THE DAVID STERLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT IT IS A PROCESS BY WHICH PEOPLE PROVIDE THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION INDICATE WHETHER THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEIR MATERIAL DELIVERED TO A DIFFERENT ADDRESS IS BY MAIL AND ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO OPT IN BY EMAIL ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL BE. GREEN IT WILL BE IN THE- EVERY ORDER WILL BE RE MY OF THAT IN THE PROCESS. EVERY OWNER WILL BE HAVE BEEN. IN THIS PROCESS AND IN THE CASE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A DELUDE AN ADDRESS WITHIN THE ASSOCIATION SUCH AS WITH A FIRE THAT CANNOT BE DELIVERED TO OUR RETREAT FROM. IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE SENT AN EMAIL THEY HAVE ON FILE- AND- AGAIN THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF HOMEOWNERS ARE REMINDED OF THAT AS WELL AS IN OUR ANNUAL DISCLOSURES THERE THE SOLICITATION FOR ANY IMITATE. ANY INFORMATION ABOUT ADDITIONAL ADDRESSES THEIR EMAIL THEY WISH YOU FOR FUTURE USE. THANK YOU SIR SENATE WHITE HOUSE KEEP UP OKAY. MISTER CHAIR I UNDERSTAND I THINK AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY FOR SOME DISTRUST FROM SOME OF THE OPPOSITION SO. I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF RATHER THAN HAVING THE DECISION MADE OF WHETHER IT WAS POSSIBLE OR NOT FOR THE PHYSICAL LOCATION BECAUSE- WE'VE HAD. THIS PANDEMIC IS GONE UP DOWN UP AND WE AT DIFFERENT TIMES IT CHANGES IF IT WERE JUST A REQUIREMENT THAT IF YOU HAVE THE EMAIL. THEY WOULD GET THAT. THEY WOULD GET NOTICE ON THAT AND THAT WOULD. HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME ASSURANCE THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE AND I'LL MAKE IT SHORT IS JUST ON THE RECORDING OF THE- OF THE- MEETINGS RIGHT NOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS IS NOT. REQUIRED I MEAN EVEN I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW THE RECORD DISEASE MEETING AND I WAS ONE OF THE AUTHOR COULD COMMENT ON WHY. IF IT'S ONLY AN EMERGENCY WHY THAT WOULDN'T BE AN ADDED PROTECTION. FOR PEOPLE FEEL MORE AT EASE WHAT WAS GOING ON. BASED ON WHAT KIND OF CONSIDER ME COULD RESPOND SO AGAIN I WILL REFER TO MR PENCIL OF MY QUICK RESPONSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE A TWO IS TO RECORD. MEETINGS AT ALL SO THIS WOULD BE. PUSHING WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THE OVERALL LAW AROUND H. AWAYS AND MEETINGS. AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO AS I SAID EARLIER CRAP A NARROW. SET OF PROCEDURES FOR WHEN THEY ARE EMERGENCIES THAT PREVENT PHYSICAL IN PERSON MEETINGS- SO WE WANTED TO JUST KIND OF KEEP THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL NARROW. AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO. MAKE OVER ARCHING CHANGES TO THE LAW THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL- BUT OUR FOR MR PENCIL AGAIN. THE SCHEDULE. MISTER CHAIR AND- SENATORS- THAT SB THREE NINETY ONE DOES NOT CHANGE A LONG STANDING CORPORATE RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION BOARD MEETING VIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDINGS HAVE NEVER BEFORE BEEN REQUIRED A COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION OR ANY OTHER CALIFORNIA CORPORATION THAT I KNOW OF I DO THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT POLICY SHIFTS THE LAB AND I BELIEVE PERSONALLY IT'LL HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSSIBLY VERY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION. IN PARTICULAR THOSE WITH LOWER LEVEL AND ON THE ECONOMIC STRATA SO AS SUCH I BELIEVE THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION. BE DROPPED SEPARATELY FROM THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR SAN JUAN CASKEY. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THIS IS ONLY TO APPLY WHEN THERE'S AN OFFICIALLY DECLARED EMERGENCY OR DISASTER SO I UNDERSTAND IT IT'S- EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT FIGHT OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALEXION'S IN THESE MEETINGS ARE OPEN AND- A FULL TIME. I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL RIGHT NOW MISTER CHAIR BUT THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO I CAN SKI I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MICROPHONES UP. ON DECEMBER MANY CHEMICALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COLLEAGUES AND TO ALL THE WITNESSES FOR TESTIFYING TODAY. I TRY TO MAKE A FEW POINTS IN CLOSING FIRST- THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL IS MEANT TO BE NARROW IT APPLIES ONLY OFFICIALLY DECLARED STATE EMERGENCIES- AND- WITH RESPECT THE ELECTIONS CONCERNS WHICH WE HEARD ABOUT FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOLKS- I SHARE THOSE CONCERNS THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS CREATE UNFAIR. ELECTIONS THAT ARE BUT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR ANY KIND OF. MISCONDUCT OR OR LESS THAN PERFECT INTEGRITY- AND AGAIN I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED HERE. IS AN EXEMPTION THERE WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED TO BE CARRIED OUT- WHEN THERE IS WHEN IT IS UNSAFE OR IMPOSSIBLE TOGETHER IN PERSON. AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE OTHER THAN TO CANCEL THE ELECTION- WHICH IS SOMETHING I THINK IS NOT A GREAT ALTERNATIVE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. CREATE PROCEDURES TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THESE TYPES OF ELECTIONS THAT MAY HAPPEN ONLY IN VERY VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES- AND SO WE DO HAVE PROCEDURAL PROTECTIONS I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THE- CIRCUMSTANCES CRIED BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES WHERE THE CAMERA TURNED OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VOTING. WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED EXPRESSING NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL. SO WE ARE PRETTY CREATING PROCEDURES THAT ARE NOT BEING CARRIED OUT RIGHT NOW UNDER WHAT'S- AFFECTED REALLY THE WILD WEST OF THE PANDEMIC. WHERE PEOPLE HOAS ARE CARRYING OUT MEETINGS REMOTELY ARE CARRYING OUT ELECTIONS REMOTELY BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVES. WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION THAT I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE. THAT LEAVES THE GENERAL POLICY OF IT THAT WE NEED TO CRAFT SOME KIND OF RELIEF. FOR SITUATIONS WHERE YOU CAN'T MEET IN PERSON BUT THAT THE LAW REQUIRES YOU TO MEET IN PERSON RIGHT NOW. FINALLY I WANT TO JUST ADDRESS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES IS CONCERNED BECAUSE I SHARE THOSE IS A AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- AND I THINK NOTICE IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. AND AGAIN I'LL EMPHASIZE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS CREATE PROCEDURES AND MORE OPEN AMENDMENTS TO FURTHER MAKE THOSE PROCEDURES MORE ROBUST. OF A RIGHT NOW. SENIORS CAN PARTICIPATE BY TELEPHONE. ALREADY- A CONFERENCE. AND THEY WOULD- BUT AS AS I NOTED. THEY WERE HAVE TO THE BILL REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO PROVIDES CLEAR TECHNICALS INSPECTS SISTANCE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PARTICIPATE- MEETING NOTICE MUST INCLUDE ALL THE FOLLOWING TELEPHONE NUMBER EMAIL THE PERSON WHO CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE TELECONFERENCE PROCESS BOTH BEFORE AND DURING MEETINGS SO TRYING TO CREATE SOME PROTECTIONS THAT DON'T EXIST RIGHT NOW. WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN AGAIN AND THIS IS IN THAT NARROW CIRCUMSTANCE WE CAN'T HAVE PHYSICAL MEETINGS IN PERSON- AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO ADDRESS BUT WITH ALL THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CINNAMON. MOTION TO I SEE MOTION. SIR LAYERED MOVES. ON THE BILL. MAN TWO COUNTS OF YOU CALL THE ROLL.

AS WAS RECOMMENDED. MEMBERS I MET THISPANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN SURVIVORS BE PUT IN AN EVEN MORE DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. THAT THERE WERE IN. BY THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS ACROSS THE WORLD C. FOR AT HOME FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS IN THE CASE. NOW WHEN THERE'S VIOLENCE IN THE HOME SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES IN THE VOLUME OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES IN THE U. S. WHICH HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS A PANDEMIC WITHIN A PANDEMIC. ACCORDING TO JUST ONE CITY IN MY DISTRICT THE EXPERIENCE A 2100% INCREASE IN CASE WORK RELATED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES LAST YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS PREVENTING SURVIVORS OF ABUSE FROM SEEKING PROTECTIVE ORDERS IN A SAFE MANNER. IT IS CRITICAL TO ALLOW FOR REMOTE TESTIMONY BECAUSE THE VICTIM IS ALREADY DEALING WITH THE TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH SEEING THEIR PERPETRATORS AND PERSON OR DEALING WITH COURSE OF CONTROL WHICH CAUSES PARALYZING FEAR. THESE ARE VICTIMS WHO ALREADY HAVE TO MUSTER THE COURAGE TO LEAVE A DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS REMOVE THE UNNECESSARY BARRIER TO KEEP THEM PROTECTED. IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY FIRST WITNESS MARC ELIOT FROM SAN DIEGO A SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY. UP MY SECOND WITNESS IS LAINE WHITE FEATHER AND ADVOCATE FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND A SURVIVOR HERSELF AND FINALLY I HAVE ON THE PHONE TODAY AND DOROTHY SAN DIEGO SUPERVISING DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY CITY ATTORNEY EXCUSE ME. WHO WILL BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU MEDICARE SET ASIDE REVIEW JUST TO CLARIFY YOU DID ACCEPT THE MOMENTS IS A RIGHT. YES I DID ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISS ELLIOTT IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M NOT WORKING AT THE COMPANY CONFIRMED YOU CAN HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. WONDERFUL THANK YOU WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR SENATOR RUBIO'S LEADERSHIP ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. I'M MARA ELLIOTT THE CITY ATTORNEY OF SAN DIEGO MY OFFICE FRIENDS AND FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER TO HELP VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEX TRAFFICKING. WE ALSO HAVE A GUN VIOLENCE RESPONSE UNIT THAT HAS INTERVENED IN MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED INSTANCES WHEN GRANDMA CAN VIOLENCE WAS THREATENED. AND ONE THIRD OF THOSE CASES THE INTENDED VICTIM WITH A SPOUSE PARTNER OR EX PARTNER. ANYONE WHO WORKS WITH SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE KNOWS HOW MUCH THEY FEAR BEING RE VICTIMIZED BY THEIR ABUSERS. WHEN THEY VISIT A COURTHOUSE EVEN IF IT'S JUST TO SEEK PROTECTION FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. FEAR OF HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE INTENSIFIED. AND FOR GOOD REASON STUDY SHOWED THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME FOR VICTIMS DURING SEPARATION AND WHEN SEEKING A RESTRAINING ORDER. BY GIVING THEM AN OPTION TO TESTIFY REMOTELY AT A HEARING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT REMOVES THAT BARRIER AND LET'S JUST TO FOLLOW ITS COURSE. OUR SYSTEM HAS NEEDED TO EVOLVE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF A PANDEMIC. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE NOW KNOW THAT REMOTE TESTIMONY IS BOTHPRACTICAL AND EFFICIENT. IN SAN DIEGO AND AROUND CALIFORNIA IT'S BEEN USED FOR BOTH TYPES OF RESTRAINING ORDERS COVERED BY SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS OR CONCERNS. WITH MOST SERVICES MAKE THE PROCESS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND LESS INTIMIDATING. IN AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO MOST DESERVE THE HIGH NEED ACCESS AND PROTECTION OF BROMO HEARING ARE THOSE WHO THINK RESTRAINING ORDERS. FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS OFTEN MOVE OUT OF STATE TO ESCAPE AN ABUSER LOSE ACCESS TO A CAR WHEN THEY'RE SEPARATED FROM THEIR ABUSER. BECOME SINGLE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE A DAY OFF WORK OR PAY FOR CHILD CARE. BILL WHEN THEY'RE OUT IN PUBLIC AND COULD BE STOCKS BY THEIR ABUSER. STUDIES ALSO SHOW A STRONG AND ALARMING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS ELLIOTT UP NEXT MISS WHITE FEATHER. YEAH THIS WHITE FEATHER YOU MADE ANY YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ELAINE WHITE FEATHER I AM A SURVIVOR AND ADVOCATE AND ACTIVIST AND A VETERAN WORKING AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE OR FORTY YEARS ON THE FRONT LINE. IT IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANY SURVIVOR OF THE CRIME OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE TO DEAL WITH OBTAINING BRINGING ORDERS HIS THE TENUOUS PROCESS THAT IS BOTH OVERWHELMING AND INTIMIDATING. TRIGGERING EVERY SURVIVOR GOING THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF SURVIVORS VICTIMS MARKET LIKE THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND AGAIN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS OFTEN 90% OF BECAUSE OF THIS. BUT NO CURRENT OPTION EFILE FOR DVR OF THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC I'VE FOUGHT THE VERY DEEPLY. I'M ALSO INCREASE REQUEST FOR SAFETY AND SERVICES THAT HELP THE BRAIN ARE LIFTED. BUT THOSE WHO DO HAVE INTERNET AND COMPUTER ACCESS E. FILING ALLOWED SURVIVORS TO KNOW THEY HAVE A PHYSICAL DISTANCE. FROM THE ABUSER AND THAT THE- YOU'VE BEEN UNAWARE OF THE PHYSICAL LOCATION. FOR THOSE WHO COULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET OR COMPUTERS HE FINALLY FROM A SAFE AND SECURE SPACE LIKE. A LOCAL TVORGANIZATION GOOD SERVICE ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AND LESS THREATENING. WAYS YOU GO THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS. AND THERE'S LIKE A PAYMENT WHAT I'M INFORMED THE PATIENT. IN ARE. LGBT I THINK OF CAR AND E. FILING COULD INCUR FULL TO TELLING AND PARTS. BEGINNING ON. THEY CAN PASSAGE ALMOND FOR LEGISLATION IN THE FORM OF SOCIAL JUSTICE BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT ONLY A CLIENT IT IS A SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE. THANK YOU MISS WHITE FEATHER.

I DID ALSO HI SO I GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ BY. HERTZBERG JONES THANK JONES I LAYERED. STERN. STERN AYE WIECKOWSKI AYE AYE CASKEY AYE WIENER WIENER I. THE LITTLE THAT'S NINE TWO ZERO SORRY ARE PUT THE BILL ON CALLED NEXT WE HAVE SB SEVEN FOUR SIX BY SENATOR SKINNER- SENATORS SKINNER- I'M SURE WILL BE ARRIVING MOMENTARILY. CAN YOU THERE WE GO. I AM TEMPORARILY- FILLING IN FOR OUR FEARLESS LEADER- CENTER SKINNER WOULD YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. MEMBERS. CAN I GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND. SO HISTORICALLY THE ONLY WAY A BUSINESS CAN LEGALLY INFLUENCE AN ELECTION IS THROUGH CASH OR AN IN KIND CONTRIBUTION OR BY MAKING INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES ALL OF WHICH ARE COVERED BY F. PPC RULES AND ARE REPORTABLE. HOWEVER RECENT ADVANCES IN VARIOUS OF OUR INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES. MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR COMPANIES TO INDIVIDUALLY INFLUENCE VOTER BEHAVIOR BY CURATING THE ONLINE CONTENT WE SEE. AND SKEWING IT TOWARD A PARTICULAR POLITICAL STANCE. OUR ELECTION LAWS HAVE NOT CAUGHT UP WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INTERNET. SO THAT ONLINE BUSINESSES THAT USE OUR INFO. SO IT'S NORMAL THAT THEY WOULD USE OUR INFO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BUY POLITICAL AD YOU'RE TARGETING THEIR POLITICAL AD TOWARDS CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT'S WITH THAT SO YOU KNOW WHERE EVEN A- A PRODUCT DAD. AND THE INTERNET SITES HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO THAT. HOWEVER THEIR ONLINE BUSINESSES THAT USE THAT SAME TARGETED INFO TO STEER INFORMATION THAT IS NOT A PAID POLITICAL AD. THAT THEN SUPPORTS OR OPPOSES A CANDIDATE OR A MEASURE. AND WHEN THEY DO THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY REPORTABLE. SO WHAT SB SEVEN FOUR SIX DOES. IS PROVIDES A REALITY CHECK FOR WE CONSUMERS AND RESTORES PUBLIC TRUST IN ONLINE CONTENT BY ALLOWING US TO KNOW IF WE'RE BEING POLITICALLY TARGETED IT ALLOWS THE CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN USED FOR A POLITICAL PURPOSE REQUEST REPORT FROM THAT BUSINESS AS TO HOW THAT INFO WAS USED REQUIRES A BUSINESS TO DISCLOSE TO THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY THE NAMES O CANDIDATES COMMITTEES OR BALLOT MEASURES WHICH THEY'VE USED PERFORMED PERSONAL INFO FOR AND WHAT THE PURPOSE WAS. AND REQUIRES THE CEO OF SUCH BUSINESSES TO CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE BUSINESS HAS TRUTHFULLY DISCLOSED ALL POLITICAL ACTIVITY. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY WITNESSES WHO ARE SKINNER OF SPEAKING IN SUPPORT ALASTAIR MACTAGGART FROM CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY AND ARIEL FOX FROM COMMON SENSE MEDIA. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER OF MR MCTAGGART ARE YOU WITH US. YES SIR CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU GO AHEAD. GREAT THANK YOU- BODY BELT RETIRED I'M CHAIR OF CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR SKINNER FOR WHO. LEADERSHIP HERE ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT. ISSUE WHICH I CONSIDER NOTHING LESS THAN A REAL THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THESE THESE TIGHT BUT THIS IS A BRAND NEW INTEREST IN IN IN OUR IN OUR DEMOCRACY THE SOCIAL MEDIA AND SEARCH COMPANIES. AND THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE. IS ALSO NEW AND YOU KNOW WE ALL REMEMBER- MR ZUCKERBERG SAYING THAT WOULD BE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO FACEBOOK IT'S A LIQUID FORM. WERE COLLECTED. WELL HOW DO WE KNOW HOW WOULD WE EVER KNOW IF FOR EXAMPLE- THAT. THEIR BUSINESS IT'S TRY TO GET THE LAW THE CARD THAT WE TAKE A AS AS- SAID. THERE'S THIS CURRENT LOOPHOLE AROUND THE BUSINESSES TO THAT FOR THE- WERE NOT TALKING TO THIRD PART AT TRUMP FOR JOE BY PUTTING. BUT THAT IS WHAT THE LAW ABOUT. BUT THIS OTHER PIECE THIS WU. AND IT AND IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. BECAUSE AT SOME POINT DON'T FIX SUMMER'S GONNA THAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO CHOOSE YOU KNOW. TO YOU- ANY OF THAT BUT THE LAST DAY JUSTIN CALL IS YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS. A PART OF BILL REQUIRES YOU SEE TWO. THAT THEIR- IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. AND ALL IT TO THEIR OUT THE FOR. IN MY OTHER LIFE YOU EVERY TIME GET A LOAN FROM A LETTER YOU YOU HAVE TO CERTIFY AND- THAT THE BONUS AND YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T. WITH THE COMPANY AND ALL THAT CERTIFICATES IS DONE- UNDER PENALTY FOR SO YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A PLAIN- BUT ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE REQUIREMENTS AND I REALLY I WANT TO THANK CENTER FOR LEADERSHIP HERE. AND I THOUGHT ON. BILL. THANK YOU MR MATTEO. OF MISS ARIAL FOX. ARE YOU AVAILABLE. MODERATORS A PARTIAL FOX ONLINE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PERSON ON THE LINE AND I'LL NO ALL RIGHT- WELL LET'S LET'S TURN TO WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY I SEE NONE- WITNESSES IN ROOM ONE TWELVE I SEE NONE.

GERMAN NUMBERS IN SENATORS THIS IS MIKE MADDOCK ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER WATCHDOG IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. THANK YOU. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE IN Q. ALREADY NOW LET'S TURN TO OPPOSITION- I DO NOT HAVE ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES LISTED IN OPPOSITION IF THERE. ARE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AS A PRIMARY WITNESS THEY MAY HAVE TWO MINUTES. MADAME MODERATOR IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE OPPOSITION. OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS AT R. ONE ZERO MY FOLKS AND WE HAVE MY NUMBER ONE FIFTY THREE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU RESPECTED YOUR MEMBERS MONEY TO SHORE UP MOHAMMED THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND NOW WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL AS DRAFTED. SB SEVEN FOUR SIX HAS DROPPED IT OVER BROAD IN ITS DEFINITION THEN FABRICATIONS REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO DISCLOSE WHETHER INFORMATION IS USED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES BUT THE DEFINITION OF POLITICAL PURPOSES MODERN UP TO INCLUDE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NON PARTISAN BUT INDIRECTLY RELATED TO SPECIFIC CANDIDATES OR BALLOT MEASURES SUCH AS- SERVING UP INFORMATION OF INTEREST TO USERS ARE. DISPLAYING CONTENT OF INTEREST USERS ADDITIONALLY AS RAPID THERE IS DIVISION IN THE BEAUTY IN THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL TO DISCOURAGE BUSINESSES FROM ENGAGING IN NON PARTISAN EFFORTS TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS RIGHT TO VOTE FOR EXAMPLE SHARING VOTER INFORMATION DISPLAYING VOTER MAPS OR REALLY POLITICAL INFORMATION OF ANY SORT OF POTENTIALLY ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL TO SHARE THAT THEY HAVE VOTED- COULD BE FRUSTRATED BY THE OVERBROAD. LANGUAGE IN IN THIS BILL AN ADDITIONAL SB SEVEN FOUR SIX EXPOSES IO'S ARE EQUIVALENT PERSONS TO PERSONAL CRIMINAL EXPOSURE BY COMPELLING THEM TO SIGN STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY REGARDING THE BUSINESSES POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WHICH THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE PERSON MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT. AND NOT ONLY DOES THIS REQUIREMENT FORCE A PERSON TO ATTACHED INFORMATION THAT SHE OR HE MAY NOT HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF YOU KNOW EVEN A GOOD FAITH DISCLOSURE OF ALL INFORMATION ON THE BILL COULD LEAD TO A CEO PERJURING HERSELF AS A RESULT OF SIMPLY MISUNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY INTENDED BUT BUILT. ON THAT OF COURSE EFFECTIVELY ASK ACTED THE DETERRENT FOR PARTICIPATING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS FOR THESE REASONS WE DO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB SEVEN FOUR SIX IMMIGRATION. ACT THANK YOU. AND THAT IS IN LINE IS PRETTY. NOT OPPOSITION OF MIND BIRTH FORTY. I DON'T KNOW HOW ON THE OF INTERNET ACCESS AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MY NUMBER SEVEN ONE. SHARE MEMBER CAME TO ME TREE A MAP ATTACKED WE LIKE THAT I GOT A CALL CAL AND SO WITH INTERNET ACCESS AND RESPECT OPPOSE SB FORTY. THANK YOU OTHERS OPPOSITION. THERE ARE NO WHAT OTHER ATHLETES ANYTHING YOU. ALL RIGHT BRING BACK TO CHECK I SEE BOARD IS MICHAEL UP CENTER BOARD IS. THANK YOU IF I MAY PUT A TO THE TO THE OFFICE YOU SURE THERE'S A- DISAPPOINTED CLARIFICATION- I KNOW LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WE DON'T LIKE BEING TARGETED BASED ON OUR METRICS ARE INFORMATION IN OUR HISTORY AND PROFILE- IT IS KIND OF A NEW REALITY THAT WE'RE HAVING TO CONFRONT. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER HOW IT IS PRE AGGREGATED INFORMATION PLEA IN THIS SCENARIO WITH THIS REQUIRED THE DISAGGREGATION OF ALREADY ACCUMULATED INFORMATION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THIS DOES NOT PREVENT THE TARGETING I THINK THAT WE CERTAINLY- WELL SOME OF US MAY OBJECT TO THE THAT TARGETING THAT IS THE CORE OF MANY OF THESE ONLINE ENTERPRISES BUSINESS. SO DOES NOT PREVENT THAT WHATSOEVER WHAT IT DOES IS AND IN FACT MANY OF US WHO RUN FOR OFFICE BY WEB ADS FOR EXAMPLE AND WE DO SO. UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WILL BE TARGETED AND WE EVEN DIRECT THE PARAMETERS- WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO PREVENT IS THAT TARGETING THAT THE COMPANY ITSELF CHOOSES TO DO. THAT IS NOT A POLITICAL AD. AND THUS IS NOT REPORTABLE SO THAT IF THEY DO THAT THEN IT IT MUST BE REPORTABLE SO IF THEY DO TARGETING ON BEHALF OF. A CERTAIN BALLOT MEASURE CANDIDATE OR OTHER VERY EXPLICIT ELECTORAL POLITICAL PURPOSE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE COVERED UNDER OUR REPORTING LAWS. THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPORT THAT. IS IT JUST A CLARIFICATION SO IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THERE'S BEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DATA COLLECTED IN IT IT EXISTS EITHER PHYSICALLY ON. IN SOFTWARE OR IN THE CLOUD. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ALREADY EXISTING PACKAGES OF INFORMATION ABOUT PROFILED INDIVIDUALS COULD THAT INFORMATION STILL BE USE RIGHT NOW OR WOULD HAVE TO BE DISAGGREGATED- I DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE DISAGREED I THINK IT'S WHAT WHAT AND FOR EXAMPLE. MANY OF US IN OUR LET'S JUST USE FACEBOOK IN THE CHATS PART OF FACEBOOK WE ARE WE OFTEN SAY- I'M YOU KNOW I SUPPORT X. RICE SUPPORT WHY. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GOING TO GET STEERED TOWARDS- YOU KNOW LET'S SAY IF IT'S A BUNCH OF DEMOCRATIC CLUBS THAT ARE SEEING- EVERYBODY SHOULD VOTE FOR X. OR Y. AND IT'S BEEN CLEAR IN MY PROFILE I AM A DEMOCRAT ALSO FOR EXAMPLE AND I MAY BE MEMBER OF VARIOUS DEMOCRATIC CLUB SPEND NOT STUFF MIGHT POP UP. ON MY FEET RIGHT THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD PREVENT THAT IT'S IF THE COMPANY ITSELF CREATES CONTENT. OR STEERS CONTENT. OF THEIR OWN SO. THAT EXAMPLE A GREAT EXAMPLE WOULD BE. IF YOU HAD GOOGLE THE- VARIOUS OF THE BALLOT MEASURES THAT WERE ON THE CALIFORNIA BALLOT STATEWIDE BALLOT MEASURES AND YOU GOOGLE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE- A. B. ANALYSIS OF THEM OR WHATEVER. THE ONLY ONE WHERE THE FIRST THING THAT POPPED UP. WAS THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT ON THAT PROPOSITION WAS THE PROPOSITION THAT AFFECTED. THOSE INTERNET COMPANIES FOR EVERY OTHER PROPOSITION IF YOU GOOGLE THAT. WHAT CAME UP WAS AND IF YOU GO ON THE SECRETARY STATE WEBSITE IT IS THE- IN FAVOR ARGUMENT THAT SHOWS UP FIRST AND THEN THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT. SO THAT'S WHAT WOULD POP UP WHEN YOU GOOGLE IT HOWEVER ON THE ONE INITIATIVE IT POPPED UP INSTEAD THE OPPOSITION. IT WAS PROBABLY NOT AN ACCIDENT. OKAY WELCOME IT WOULD BE- I UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT TO WANTING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT IF WE ARE TARGETED THAT THAT WE ARE AWARE THAT WERE BEING TARGETED UP FOR PARTICULAR VERSUS PURPOSE AND THERE'S A DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO GO ALONG WITH THAT- WOOD I DON'T KNOW IF AMENDMENTS HAD EVER BEEN PROPOSED. ON THIS NIGHT DO THIS IN A RESPECTFUL FRIENDLY MANNER- THE CEO- COMPONENT OF IT- I THINK MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S PROBABLY YOUR INTENT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER- REVISING INTO THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER IN IT BEING AN ATTESTATION NOT UNDER PERJURY FOR EXAMPLE IT'LL LEAVE THAT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THANK YOU. PRITCHETT THANK YOU- I UNDERSTAND THAT ARIAL FOXES ON THE PHONE WE CALLED UPON HER EARLIER BUT- BECAUSE OF. SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY WORK ABLE TO ACCESS HER- SO IT MISS FOX IS AVAILABLE- GO AHEAD AND TESTIFY. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. WONDERFUL THANK YOU GOOD EVENING KAREN MEMBERS I'M ARIAL SOCKS JOHNSON WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA. COMMONSENSE BECAUSE A COW CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT WHICH GIVES IMPORTANT PRIVACY RATE TO ADULT TEENS AND KIDS AND WE WERE PLEASED TO SUPPORT LAST YEAR'S PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR. IN ORDER FOR CONSUMERS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EXERCISE THEIR GTK RIGHT LIKE HEALTH COMPANIES TO STOP SELLING OR USING CERTAIN DATA FOR TO DELETE IT. CONSUMERS MUST CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT BUSINESSES ARE DOING WITH THEIR DATA IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT'S THE CCPA ALSO REQUIRES TRANSPARENCY AND THAT BUSINESS IS EXPLAINED THE BUSINESS OR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES OF THEIR DATA PROCESSING WHICH AS WE HAVE ALL SEEN BUSINESSES CAN USE INDIVIDUALS PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES AS WELL. AND CONSUMERS OFTEN HAVE NO IDEA THAT THIS IS THE CASE COMPANIES HAVE DETAILED DOSSIERS ON INDIVIDUALS AND CAN USE THAT INFORMATION TO ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE THE ACTIONS OF A VOTER. SUCH AS BY PREVENTING ONE KIND OF AN ISSUE IN RESPONSE TO A SEARCH QUERY OR DETERMINING WHAT ORDER CONTENT WILL SHOW UP FIRST IN THE FEET. SUCH ACCENT SUCH ACTIONS ARE CURRENTLY NOT DISCLOSEABLE UNDER CAMPAIGN. FINANCE RULES. UNDER SKINNER WOULD STRENGTHEN THE CT. TO ENSURE THAT. CAN NO COME ARE USING THEIR PERSONAL AND FROM TO AND THEIR- IT WOULD HELP RESTORE TRUST INTO COMPANY AND THEIR ROLE IN THE FUNCTIONING TO. TRUST TECH RIGHT NOW IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW. ORDINANCE AT A MENTAL LAST WEEK INTERESTED SO MEDIA. AS LESS THAN FOR ALL OTHER TYPES OF THIS. ANOTHER PULLED DECLINING TRUST AND THAT A MAJORITY CONSUMERS RIGHT NOW WOULD RATHER KEEP THEIR INFORMATION PRIVATE AND SETTLE FOR GENERIC PRODUCTS RATHER THAN SHARE IT FOR PERSONALIZATION. CONSUMER TRUST IS CRITICAL TO BUSINESSES AND DEMOCRACY THRIVING AND IT'S A MISINFORMATION AND MANIPULATION GROW WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE CONSUMERS CAN TRUST UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY SEE ONLINE. THE COMPANY USES AN INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO ENCOUNTER VOTE YOU SHOULD AT THE VERY LEAST BE MADE AWARE OF IT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I. THE SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL ALL RIGHT BRING IT ONCE AGAIN BACK TO THE CHAMBER I SEE NO OTHER MICROPHONES THAT ARE RAISED- IS THERE A MOTION. SENATOR US MOST. ALL RIGHT CENTER SKINNER DOT. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE OR THANK YOU BENCI COUNSEL TO CALL THE ROLL THIS IS S. B. C. FORTY SIX THE MOTION BY SEN DID I SELL. THE IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS I'M BURKE. AMBERG I. WE'RE JUST NOT VOTING IT'LL ZERO AYE INDEED AYE SO DID I SO I GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I HERTZBERG DEFINITION JONES RIGHT BUT JONES NO LAYERED. LAYERED BY STERN THE DIVISIONS ARE TOO BROAD AND IT IS CAPTURES. IT'S QUITE CAL SKI. CASKEY WE YEAH WIENER I'D THAT'S NINETEEN. THAT TWO ONE A COUPLE NOT WILL IN PLACE AT ON CALL THANK YOU GET I'VE TURNED THE GAVEL OVER THIS BORE JUST- IN ORDER. OUR BOARD TO SHARE I PRESUME THE BILLS. ALL RIGHTS AMERICA THANK YOU AND IF YOU PLEASE PRESENT YOUR BILL SB SIX. THANK MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE PRESENT SB THREE SIX ONE IT'S VERY BILL SIMPLY MEANS THAT A CONTRA. ENTERED INTO A- FOR PURPOSES OF BUYING OR PURCHASING- BUYING PURCHASING LEASING A CAR IS BINDING- VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER ELECTRONIC CONTRACT IS BINDING YOU COULD MORTGAGE YOUR HOME YOU COULD BUY A HOME ELECTRONICALLY AND THAT WOULD BE BINDING. WELL THE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRONIC CONTRACTS AND I UNDERSTAND SOME FOLKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OVERREACHING AND OVERBEARING SO% FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU DECIDE TO GO INTO A DEALERSHIP AND ELECTRONIC CONTRACT- ON A TABLET THAT. PERHAPS ON THE CONCERN IS THAT A SALES PERSON MAY BE LEANING OVER ONE SHOULDER AND RIFLING THROUGH THE CONTRACT WITHOUT ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW AND AGREE TO THE VARIOUS PROVISIONS- THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT YOU FROM ENGAGING IN A HARD COPY. CONTRACTUAL PROCESS WITH A WITH A CAR DEALER- IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT YOU CAN BE BOUND AND YOU COULD. ENTER INTO A CONTRACT ELECTRONICALLY. SINCE THE CALL THE- THAT UPON US WELL WE'VE ALWAYS. MUCH MORE COMMERCE BEING CONDUCTED ELECTRONICALLY AND MUCH MORE COMMERCE BEING CONDUCTED FROM ONE'S HOME. WELL IN FACT I THINK THAT THAT. REALLY REDUCES THE CHANCE OF A SALES PERSON OVERBEARING ON A CONSUMER WHEN YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW THE TRANSACTION AT HOME AT YOUR LEISURE AT WHATEVER TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT YOU CHOOSE TO DO SO- IS A SAID IT IT'S A SIMPLE BILL. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU VOTE HI I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MR ANTHONY SAMPSON MANAGING PRINCIPAL SAMSON ADVISORS AS WELL AS MR IN NYC LAPUS. I'M HOPING THEY'RE BUILT ON THE PHONE YEAH. ALL RIGHT YES I'M HERE. GET AFTER I DAMPEN ON THE OF THE NEW CARD ASSOCIATION I FIRST WANT I THANK THE CHAIR FOR OFFERING BILL JUST BECAUSE THEY THE VIA PRODUCT PURCHASE AT LEAST PROCESS SIMPLER FASTER AND CONVENIENT BY TAKING ADVANTAGE. OF THE EFFICIENCIES OF THE DIGITAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE USED IN MANY OTHER CONTACT. TODAY THE SENATE ADVANCE. AND I KNOW WE'RE GETTING TO THE END OF THE HEARING THE CHAIRS ALREADY PROVIDE A GREAT SUMMER THE BILL SO I JUST WANT TO ADD A FEW. FIRST CONSUMER SURVEYS SHOW THAT CUSTOMERS OVERWHELMINGLY PREFER TO COMPLETE THE CAR BUYING AND LEASING PROCESS FROM THE COMFORT OF THEIR OWN HOME. RATHER THAN AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THIS PROPOSAL. ALLOWED THEM TO DO JUST THAT. BACK IN THE RETURN TALK AUTOMOTIVE SURVEY. SEVEN OUT OF TEN CONSUMERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BUY A CAR FROM A DEALERSHIP IF THEY CAN START THE PROCESS ONLINE FROM HOME. WE'RE VERY MINDFUL THE PURCHASING OR LEASING A VEHICLE COULD BE A LONG PROCESS AND IT FINDS AN INTIMIDATING ONE. BUT FROM HOME CONSUMERS FEEL LESS PRESSURE IN CAN REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AND MORE FAMILIAR AND COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT. RATHER THAN IN THE PRESIDENT OF THE VEHICLE SALE P. MANY DEALERSHIPS. TO CONSUMER INSTEAD ELECT TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP. FOR THEIR PURCHASE OR LEASE TRANSACTION FINING THE CONTRACT ON AN ELECTRONIC DEVICES ACROSS THIS WHICH WHICH MOST IF NOT ALL CONSUMERS ARE VERY MUCH EXCEPT THEM. AS IT IS CURRENTLY PERMITTED IN A VARIETY OF OTHER CONTACTS. SECOND THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS BILL PROPOSES TO DO ONE THING NAMELY THAT IS AUTHORIZED THE VEHICLE SALE LEASE TRANSACTIONS TO BE SIGNED ELECTRONICALLY. CALIFORNIANS FEDERAL LAW IMPOSED MANY REQUIREMENTS ON DEALERS RELATED TO THE SALE OF A MOTOR VEHICLE AND THESE REQUIREMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER VEHICLE CONTRACT IS EXECUTED ELECTRONICALLY. BY WAY OF ONE EXAMPLE THE FEDERAL TRUTH IN LENDING ACT REGULATIONS THE WHICH STATE THAT THE CUSTOMER MUST BE FREE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF. AND REVIEW THE CONTRACT IN ITS ENTIRETY FRONT AND BACK. BEFORE SIGNING THE FINAL CONTRACT REMAINS IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. FURTHER LAWS PROTECTING CONSUMERS AGAINST FRAUDULENT ACTS SUCH AS UNILATERALLY MODIFYING THE TERMS OF THE FULLY EXECUTED CONTRACT WITHOUT THE CONSUMER'S CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. AND FINALLY THE CAN NOW FOR A- THE SIMPSONS TERM FOR BY THE GENERAL'S OFFICE INCLUDE THAT THAT BILL WOULD ALLOW DEALERS TO TAP ON. ON ONE QUOTE AT ON THE COUNTRY. SUCH AS WARM THEN IT. FEES WITH THE CAN NOW WORK. OR CONSENT. BUT DO WE SO IS ALL FOR. ON CURRENT. SPECIFIC THE ARE. SALES AND- ACT WORKS. THE DEALER PROVIDE SIMPSON NUMBER WITH THE. THREE ONE YES IF YOU WRAP IT UP REAL QUICK I I'M THAT. ABSOLUTELY THAT PRECOGS FOR FORM NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO THE EXIT OF THE- AGAIN THAT DOESN'T SEEK TO ELIMINATE OTHERWISE MODIFY THAT COULD FOR. REQUIREMENTS AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR BRING THE FORWARD IN A PRE IF YOU CONCERT. THANK YOU THANK YOU N. NEXT UP MODERN CAN YOU CONFIRM- NICHOLAS- WITH CAL. AGAIN WASTE ON THE LINE. IN OF SO- I AM COMPLETE YOUR BECOME TO TWO MINUTES AND. GOOD AFTERNOON NICHOLAS OF. AGAINST WAY- GIVEN THE LATENESS OF AN OKAY MY COMMON WERE VERY SHORT. WE THROW AWAY A HUNDRED FIFTH THOUSAND. OF OFFICE PAPER EVERY YEAR. AND IT IS REALLY ONE OF THE MORE STAGGERING STATISTICS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THAT IS UNNECESSARY AND TAKE THEM THAT WE CAN TRANSITION TO- TO ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES. ACROSS THE ECONOMY IT WILL BE ABLE TO GET RID OF ONE OF THE- LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR- WASTE REDUCTION. FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT ARE YOU SURE I THOUGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU LET'S BEGIN WITH ANY SUPPORT WITNESSES HERE IN THE SENATE GALLERY. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN ROOM. ONE TWELVE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A VIDEO FEED ON ONE TWELVE. NONE THERE WE GO WE GOT IT NOW- NO ONE IS IN ROOM ONE TWELVE- WILL MOVE ON TO THE SUPPORT WITNESSES WE'VE TESTIFIED VIA TELECONFERENCE ORVIS MODERATE IF YOU COULD PLEASE PROMPT INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE SIX ONE. AND ALSO TELL ME HOW MANY ARE THERE IN THE QUEUE UP. OKAY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW HAVE FIVE IN THE QUEUE AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO SUPPORT THAT IS ONE THEN ZERO. IMMUTABLE THE LINE UP. TO SEVENTY THREE. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS ANOTHER LUCK WITH THE WIDENING GROUP ON BEHALF OF EACH YEAR AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU NINE NUMBER. THREE TWENTY EIGHT. HEY THAT LINE HAS DROPPED OUT AND WE HAVE MY NUMBER. THREE THIRTY ONE. IN IN CHERRY MEMBERS NAMELY TO WE KEEP YAKKING ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE AND SUPPORT. IN THEIR LAST SUPPORT IS. THREE TWENTY FOUR. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER OF THE AND UNITING HERE ON BEHALF OF RIGHT MARIA CAN YOU CONFIRM THERE'S NO ONE ELSE- WAITING IN THE QUEUE TO OFFER SUPPORT. THERE ARE NO OTHER. CALLERS IN THE QUEUE THANK YOU HAVING HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORTERS WILL NOW FALL THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES. EARLY THERE WAS A- NO OPPOSITION. IN THE PERSON ANYONE IN THE SENATE GALLERY. SEEING NONE ANYONE IN ONE TWELVE. STE SEEING NONE- LET'S MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES- TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE MODERATOR ANY INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. THIS TO BE THEIR OPPORTUNITY RECERTIFIED THE NUMBER THANK. SURE WE HAVE LINE NUMBER THREE TWENTY SEVEN. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ROSE MERRY SHAKE HIM PRESIDENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AND- I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION AND THE AUTHOR'S INTENT- HOWEVER WE SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WE REGRET THAT WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL UNLESS IT'S AMENDED TO INCLUDE JUST SOME BASIC SAFEGUARDS. ARE NECESSARY- AND- WE HEAR FROM CONSIDER WHO HAVE BEEN SOME TO YOU CONTRACTING. CURRENTLY AND- WHEN IT GOES WELL CAN GO VERY WELL AND WHEN THEY HAVE POSSESSION OF THE DOCUMENTS AND CAN REVIEW THEM AT THEIR LEISURE- THERE REALLY BANDAGES FOR CONSUMERS UNDER THAT SCENARIO. BUT UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES WHEN CONSUMERS ARE AT THE DEALERSHIP THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO. ACCESS THE DOCUMENT DIRECTLY AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T SEE THE TERMS AT ALL THEY JUST SEE THE BACK OF THE COMPUTER MONITOR AND SO THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF ABUSES AND WE WOULD URGE THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO ENSURE THAT UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. SAID CONSUMERS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE DIP THE INFORMATION ON THEIR OWN DEVICE. AND IN THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE DEAL WAS NEGOTIATED AND THAT IF THERE'S A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE VERSION THAT'S- IN THE POSSESSION OF THE DEALER AND WHAT THE CONSUMER HAVE ON THEIR DEVICES IT'S PRESUMED. THAT THE CONSUMERS VERSION IS A VALID ONE AND ALSO THAT WHEN THERE ARE VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL LAW THAT THEY WOULD BE ENFORCEABLE UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION. STATUTES SO THAT FOR INSTANCE THE TRUTH IN LENDING PROVISIONS THAT- THOSE SUPPORTERS MENTIONED CAN BE ENFORCED UNDER OUR STATE LAW THANK YOU MA'AM CAN YOU ARE THANK YOU YOUR NAME- I'M NOT CERTAIN I CAUGHT THAT WHEN YOU FIRST BEGAN. TO OVER FIFTY ROAD MERRY SHEA HAND AND I'M PRESIDENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY THANK YOU. MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. IF NOT WE'LL MOVE ON TO INDIVIDUAL. OF FOLKS WISHING DO NOT. AND THAT WAS A NO. YEAH WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY LIKE YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU TO ALL THE FOLKS WHO OFFERED SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WHEN I BRING THIS DISCUSSION BACK TO- SENATOR WHAT KASKY. THANK YOU MR ARCHER I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WERE RAISED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ART WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS IT SEEMS. A POSITIVE THING THAT PEOPLE COULD READ THE CONTRACT AT HOME THEY COULD LOOK AT LOOK AT IT ON THEIR TABLETS AND IN THE LAND AND- AVOID THAT PRESSURE. I'M WONDERING. IF DO YOU ANTICIPATED TO THE DEALERS WOULD SEND THE CONTRACTS TO THE PEOPLE ON THEIR TABLET WHEN THEY'RE AT THE WHEN I LOOK AT THE CAR AND THEY SAID MAKE CONTRACT AND THEN I GO HOME AND I. I LOOK AT IT OR AND WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW IF THEY- IF IT WERE POT IF IT WERE A FILLED CAR RIDE ISSUE WHEN PEOPLE SIGN. I'M SURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SIR WIECKOWSKI. BOB THIS IS HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE LAST VIEWS BUT MORE PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS PEOPLE DON'T GO INTO A DEALERSHIP. PEOPLE PURCHASE A CAR ONLINE. THEY LOOK AT THE CAR. THEY EXAMINE THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE CAR THEY PURCHASED THE CAR ONLINE IS DELIVERED TO THEIR HOME. WITHOUT EVER VISITING A DEALERSHIP. BOB IF A PERSON DOESN'T DEALERSHIP AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AND WE WILL WORK CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. I THINK THE PRIMARY CONCERNS ARE WHEN YOU GO TO A DEALERSHIP. AND YOU HAVE A TABLET AS WAS TESTIFIED BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES AND YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE TABLET SOMEHOW THE- SALES PERSON IS RIFLING THROUGH IT. AND JUST GETTING YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS THAT YOU SEEING IT. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE AND WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT SO IF YOU'RE IN THE DEALERSHIP YOU GET A CONTRACT TO GET. PRESS YOU GET IT HARD COPY- BUT- AGAIN I HAVE PURCHASE THINGS ONLINE. FOR THE LUXURY MY OWN HOME SOMETIMES AND WANTED BUT NEVER PRESSURED TO DO SO- VERSUS HISTORICALLY GOING TO YOU KNOW BUY USED CAR. AND IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE IT'S THE IT IS A LOT EASIER AND A LOT LESS. PRESSURE FILLED TO DO SO AT HOME. I KNOW MISTER CHAIR FOR A SECOND. THERE ARE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW AND SOME HEALTH FRAUDULENT CAN FRAUDULENT REPRESENTATIONS AND WE HOPE THAT THE LAW. PUNISHES THOSE PEOPLE ARE COLLECTS ON THE AG'S OFFICE YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK I HEARD THE WITNESS SAYING WELL WE NOW THAT THOSE ARE THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE ALREADY PROHIBITED BY LAW BUT THE AG'S OPPOSITION TO THIS IS THAT THIS. ELECTRONIC MEDIUM IS CORRECT THE REASON IT WASN'T INCLUDED IN. THE ORIGINAL- THE- EDTA WAS BECAUSE OF. ON TO SAY THIS GRACEFULLY THIS THIS THIS PRESSURE THE PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY GO IN AND THEY PAYING PURCHASE PURCHASE A CAR- HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THOSE THINGS THAT THE POTENTIAL HAS NOT CHANGED AS FAR AS THE AG'S OFFICE AND THEY'RE STILL PROSECUTING THESE THINGS ARE STILL THIS BAD ACTIVITY GOING ON AND THEY FEEL THAT THE ELECTRONIC. TRANSACTION IS GOING TO OPEN UP THOSE. POSSIBILITIES SO I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH THE PROPOSITION THAT. BUYING A CAR IS SO UNIQUE. THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT FROM YOUR HOME- SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU IS I SAID EARLIER YOU CAN MORTGAGE YOUR HOUSE. FROM YOUR HOME- I THINK THAT. I THINK TIMES HAVE CHANGED NUMBER ONE AND I THINK THAT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IN ANY TRANSACTION.WHERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT- THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FOR EXAMPLE TO THE SALES PERSON YOU MAY ENCOUNTER SOME SORT OF OVERBEARING SALES PEOPLE OVERBEARING SALES PEOPLE WHO MAY. PRESSURE YOU INTO BUYING THINGS THAT YOU DON'T WANT. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU BUY THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT'S FRAUD. AND YOU CAN'T BE HELD TO THAT IF YOU ENTER INTO A CONTRACT BASED ON FRAUDULENT REPRESENTATIONS AS IS AS WE KNOW THAT IS THE VOID OR VOIDABLE. SO I DON'T I DON'T SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS SIMPLY. OKAY THAT'S MY QUESTIONS OR ANY OTHER MEMBER WISHING TO- PUT FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE- CENTER OMER WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. URGENT IDLE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION ON SB THREE SIX ONE. I'LL MAKE THAT MOTION- THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY THE TEMPERATURE CENTER BORDERS- THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS- COUNCIL WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION OKAY THIS IS SB THREE SIXTY ONE BY SENATOR- BURKE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS I'M BURKE HI. I'M BURKE HI. PORTIS FIVE BARGES HI CAMBIADO HI KERRY AT ALL I DID SO NINE DID SO I CONSULT I WANT. I HERTZBERG. JONES JONES I LAYERED HI LAYERED I STERN SURE NINE STERN I Y. CASKEY NO WAY CASKEY NO WIENER ALL RIGHT WIENER AYE THAT'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT THAT'S NINETY ONE PUT IT ON CALL. NINE HIS WANTED NO N. ONE ABSENT AND PLEASE PUT THIS- THIS BILL ON CALL THANK YOU. OKAY MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY FIVE SB SIX SIX FIVE ALSO BY CENTER- BURKE- CAN YOU PLEASE PERCENT. YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB SIX SIX FIVE IT IS ALSO SIMPLE BILL WHAT IT DOES IS IT SIMPLY ALLOWS THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC SECTOR'S MABEL TO DO. FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THAT'S PROVIDE A HIRING PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS THERE ARE SEVERAL PURPOSES TO DO SO FIRST IS TO RECOGNIZE AND HONOR THE SERVICE OF VETERANS SECONDLY IS TO PROVIDE THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE SAME. BENEFIT IF YOU WILL AS THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR BY BASICALLY. PROVIDING THIS PREFERENCE TO VETERANS. AND THIRD IT ALSO. IT PROVIDES ESPECIALLY A INCENTIVE FOR FOLKS TO ENTER INTO MILITARY SERVICE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE BELIEVES THAT SOCIETAL GOOD I DO I REALLY RECOGNIZE SOME DON'T THAT WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO JOIN MILITARY SERVICE IT'S SERVICE THAT FUNCTION AS WELL- THERE ARE THERE ARE. CLEARLY SOME WRONGFUL ACTS THEY'VE BEEN DONE BY THE MILITARY AS AN INSTITUTION. SEGREGATION IN THE MILITARY AS EXISTS ANYWHERE WAS WRONG THAT WAS ABOLISHED IN THE LATE NINETEEN FORTIES- DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS THAT WAS WRONG. IT'S BEEN ABOLISHED DISCRIMINATION IN BEIJING AGAINST TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS THAT WAS WRONG IT'S BEEN ABOLISHED. THE QUESTION NOW IS FOR THE TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD SERVICE MEMBERS LEAVING SERVICE DO WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT TRANSITION DO WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES OUR MILITARY- TODAY IS HAS AN OVER REPRESENTATION OF CERTAIN GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE OVERREPRESENTED AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION THE SAME THING WITH WITH LATINOS THEY'RE OVER REPRESENTED AS COMPARED TO THE- GENERALPOPULATION. WOMEN COMPRISE A SMALLER PORTION OF THE MILITARY- AS WOULD BE TESTIFIED BY MY WIFE MILITARY WAS NOT THE MOST WELCOME PLACE TO WORK MOMENT FOR MANY MANY YEARS THAT IS DIFFERENT TODAY THAT IS DIFFERENT TODAY THE QUESTION IS AGAIN DO WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT TO A VETERAN WHO'S LEAVING SERVICE I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WOULD% APPLY NOT JUST TO THE TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLDS NOT JUST THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS. BUT TO THOSE WHO ARE FURTHER ALONG AS VETERANS BOB AND- SOME VETERANS WHO ARE OLDER. REQUIRE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT IS WELL VETERANS HAVE A HIGHER HOMELESS POPULATION AND THEY HAVE A HIGHER SUICIDE RATE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND SO AS A SOCIETAL GOOD I THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM THAT PREFERENCE. IF WE DO WILL BE JOINING FORTY OTHER STATES THAT DO SO. SO AYE RICHER AYE VOTE I ALSO HAVE A TWO WITNESSES WHO I HOPE YOU'RE ON THE PHONE LINE TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT WE HAVE- MISTER MICHAEL CALLED BERMAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL.

THANK YOU ALL RIGHT HAVING HEARD FROM ALL THE SUPPORTERS ONE OF ALL THE SAME PROCESS IN HERE FOR MANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES. MODERATE MODERATE I BELIEVE KEVIN BAKER WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS ON THE LINE IN OPPOSITION CAN YOU CONFIRM. HIS TEACHER I'M- THE TEACHER NUMBERS CONNECTING THIS IS KEVIN BAKER OF GOVERNMENTAL. WITH ACLU CALIFORNIA. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE SKILLS YOU HAVE DONE A LOT OF ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF MILITARY VETERANS OVER MANY YEARS. INCLUDING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND THE PROBLEMS OF IMMIGRANT VETERANS. I MEAN WE APPLAUD THE AUTHORS GOAL OF ATTACHING EMPLOYMENT. FOR VETERANS. WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR WE REGRETTABLY FIND OURSELVES NEVERTHELESS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT ITERATION. BUT APPELLEE OUR REQUESTED AMENITIES SMALL BUT WHAT ISN'T. WE SIMPLY ASKED THE BILL CLEAR THAT IT IS NOT INTENDED TO ALLOWS. AGAINST WOMEN AND OTHERS THAT IS CURRENTLY OUT. AND WE'RE WHO NOTED IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME NUMBERS. ALL OF DISCORDANT BACK DISCRIMINATE WHICH RECOGNIZING AGO AND HAS NEVER REALLY. BEEN QUITE. DESPITE THE SENATE BY THE TRUMP AND THE TO A POLICY UNDER LAW. THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL IS TO PREVENT INSTRUCTIONS. CAN'T PUT HAPPEN TO PUT INTO AGAINST WOMEN OTHERS HAVE BEEN. I'M NO. HE'S CALLED HE'S TO IN VERY DESCRIBE BUT THEY OFTEN. COM TO THIS ONE TEN. YOU S. ECONOMY PLAN THE TOPIC COMMISSION HAS NOTED THAT VETERAN PREFERENCE PUBLIC ARE. JUST ON THE BASE OF GENDER BECAUSE ABOUT 90% OF THE GROUP MADE UP MAIL. WHAT WOULD WHO THAT IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RULE PERMIT FEDERAL POLICY. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T BE JUST. IT ONLY MEANS THAT THERE'S A SCREEN TOWARDS PACKAGE. MINOR DETAILS THEY ARE TO THE TECH. AND THE PRO- PROBABLY ON LARGELY NEGATED BY THE- COUNTERVAILING TENDENCY OF PUBLIC TO BE MORE. TO BECOME THAT AGAINST ANOTHER CLASSES. ONE WITH MORE ROBUST PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF GOVERNMENTAL. OPENING UP VETERANS GROUP POLL TO PRIVATE EMPLOYER LEAST TO IN THE- OUT. ASSEMBLY SO MANY AND ENJOY IN THE SECTOR MISTER BAKER HUGH IF ANY COMES YES MISTER BUSH. ARE YOUR TIME IS UP YEAH YOU READ IT UP THANK YOU VERY. PART OF THE TO DO I DO BELIEVE THE ARE OTHER TESTIFYING WITNESSES NOT BE SO OFTEN JUST HAVE A MOMENT LONGER. I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT ARE VERY FEW CAN. AGAINST FAILURE TO HIRE WOMEN OTHER UP. GROUPS IN PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT. THE ONE CONSTRAINT WE HAVE THERE'S A LAW AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. BUT THAT MORE WILL BE A MYSTERY ON THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW A COMPLETE DEFENSE AGAINST WHICH WOULD IMPACT DISCRIMINATION. UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO CLOSE OFF THAT POSSIBILITY. WE HAVE HEARD REPRESENT OF IN HEALTH. LGBTQ MEMBERS FROM THE NO. INCREASED IN THE YEARS. AT IS CERTAINLY TO THE GOOD. BUT OF COURSE THIS IS ABOUT BETTER NOT DO MEMBERS OF THOSE WITH MISSION BEEN JUST. APOLLO EMPLOYMENT. PROTECTIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE IN THE- NOW. IS LIKE A POLICY DISC PROTECTION WITHIN THE HEART TECH AREA BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE WOMEN IN COLLEGE STEM CLASSES THAN THERE USED TO BE. FINALLY JUST MENTION THAT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST VETERANS IS CURRENTLY PROHIBITED INCLUDING ANY POLICIES THAT HAVE DISPARATE IMPACT AGAINST VETERANS. ALL PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH SIMPLY ALLOW OTHER GROUPS TO HAVE THE SAME PROTECTION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION VETERANS HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER OCCUR. I APPRECIATE THE CALL- ARE MOVING ON ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE SENATE GALLERY SEEING NONE ROOM ONE TWELVE. ALSO SEEING NINE WILL MOVE ON TO- WITNESSES WAITING TESTIFIED VIA TELECONFERENCE MODERATOR ANY FOLKS WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. TWO SIX SIX FIVE. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO OPPOSITION PLEASE. ONE ZERO. IT'LL BE JUST ONE SECOND HERE. OKAY AND WE HAVE A LINE- THREE ELEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER AND I'M PROVIDING A COMMENT ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHT THAT THE KIDS THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND EQUALITY CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL. HOWEVER WE APPRECIATE THAT THE OFFICE OFFICE OF THE GREETED ME WITH THAT THIS WEEK TO DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESSED THE BOARD THAT WE HAVE AND I BELIEVE WE ALL SHARE WHICH IS CONCERNED THAT THE BILL DOES NOT UNINTENTIONALLY HAVE A GOOD FOR IMPACT ON WOMEN AND HISTORICALLY. EXCLUDED GROUPS WE LOOK FOR. HOW MUCH. THANK YOU MOTOR CAN YOU CAN. THERE'S NO. ELSE THE LINE. YOU INDIVIDUAL OR OTHERWISE THERE ARE. YES THERE IS NOBODY IN THE QUEUE RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MIKE'S UP LET'S START WITH- CENTER DRAWS- AND THEN CENTER WHAT CASTING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I AM REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S-PASSION AND COMMITMENT TO. DO EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR VETERANS. THIS IS A DIFFICULT BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND- I TRULY RESPECT AND WOULD LIKE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN. SUPPORT OUR VETERANS URGE FOR VETERANS IN MY FAMILY STARTING WITH MY FATHER- AND I. UNDERSTAND THIS- WHEN THE SYSTEM THE- VETERANS THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMED SERVICES FOR THE MOST PART ARE WORKING CLASS- MEN AND WOMEN THEY- MANY TIMES DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER OPTION DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER JOB. WHICH IS WHY THEY SOMETIMES THAT WAS THE REASON. THEY WERE PUSHED AND FORCED TO DO THAT AS AS THEIR ONLY OPTION- BUT AT THE HEART OF IT AT THE CORE WAS OBVIOUSLY A COMMITMENT TO THIS COUNTRY. SO THAT OTHER HAND I'VE SPENT MY LIFE FIGHTING AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE GROUPS OF. AMERICANS ARE NOT. DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED AND DISCRIMINATED AND PUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST WHILE OTHERS KEEP RISING TO THE TOP. SO IT'S- IT'S DIFFICULT- ON THIS SO I WOULD REALLY URGE- WORDS THE AUTHORED TO AS YOU ARE. GOING TO MEET WITH THEM THOSE WHO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE CONCERNS- THAT WE DO ALL WE CAN TO- NOT ALLOWED DISPARATE IMPACT. ON ALL ON OTHER GROUPS- AND THAT WE LOOK FOR WAYS OF ADDRESSING. THAT ISSUE- IDEA I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I REALLY WANT US TO ADDRESS THAT- THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO CENTER WHAT CASKEY AND THEN CENTER WIENER. I'M LOOKING AROUND I THINK I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT IS VOTED NO ON THIS BILL THREE TIMES SO. THERE'S OMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT BEING HERE FOR A WHILE. OPPOSITION RAISES A POINT ABOUT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW BEING A COMPLETE DEFENSE AGAINST- WHAT WOULD ORDINARILY BE UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION. HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT THE AUTHOR- AND I'VE HEARD THE CONCERN THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL BE USED AS A SUBTERFUGE FOR HIRING YOU KNOW A CERTAIN KIND OF WHITE MALES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S A SUBTERFUGE FOR HIRING WHITE MALES TO THE EXTENT THERE CAN BE LANGUAGE IT SAYS IF YOU'RE USING THIS IN A WAY THAT THE SUBTERFUGE TO HIRE WHITE MALES THEN I'LL CERTAINLY ENTERTAINING I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT LANGUAGE IS IF THE CONCERN IS AN AND THE OPPONENTS SAY LOOK AT UNTIL THE MILITARY IS ATTAINABLE GOAL FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS IS TO SIMPLY NOT ATTAINABLE GOAL AND IF THEY'RE SAYING THE VETERAN POPULATION NEED BE FIFTY FIFTY THAT'S NOT ATTAINABLE GOAL IN THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS OR SO BECAUSE THE RIGHT EFFECTS THEY'RE NO LONGER ARE THE BARS THAT ONCE EXISTED FOR EXAMPLE FOR WOMEN WILL HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT IT WILL COULD IN FACT. GIVEN THE POPULATION THE MILITARY TODAY IT PROBABLY HAS A DISPARATE IMPACT IT PROBABLY IT FAVORS LATINOS BECAUSE THE LATINOS HAVE A LARGER PORTION OF THE MILITARY THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION IT FAVORS AFRICAN AMERICANS BECAUSE AFRICAN AMERICANS COMPRISE A LARGER PORTION MILITARY THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION WHICH IS SIMPLY A FACT AND IT'S A GOOD THING BY THE WAY I THINK IT IS A GOOD THING THAT THAT THAT THE MILITARY HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF LATINOS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF BLACKS BECAUSE IT IT EXPOSES FOLKS TO ONE ANOTHER. MODERATE ECONOMIC MEANS. IF YOU LOOK AT TODAY'S MILITARY. YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT PEOPLE JOIN THE MILITARY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS MANY MANY MANY ARE BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC NECESSITY YOU KNOW I STUCK AROUND FOR A LONG TIME I COULDN'T GO TO COLLEGE BUT FOR THE MILITARY I SIMPLY WENT TO THE MILITARY FOR THE EDUCATION. NOT FOR THE REASONS LATER ON I DEVELOP SOME OTHER PASSIONS BUT I WENT TO THE MILITARY BECAUSE I WON A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY OVERWHELMINGLY ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY THEY- HAVE LIMITED CHOICES NOW I THINK MILITARY STRONG I THINK IT'S VERY IVERSE. I THINK IT'S GOT SOME INCREDIBLE HUMAN BEINGS. BUT BUT IT WILL HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT IT WILL FAVOR LATINOS IT WILL FAVOR AFRICAN AMERICANS IT WILL FAVOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE NO OTHER OPTIONS. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. WHAT ARE THE RECORD CARE ACT INSURANCE- I AB ARE YOU OPENING STATEMENT I APPLAUD THE- IDEA OF HAVING INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE MILITARY AND WE HAVE THIS CROSS SECTION OF. LGBT AND ALLY TINOS AND EVERYONE. THE AUTHOR AND ARE OF A CERTAIN AGE WE REMEMBER THAT THE REASON THAT WE HAVE LANGUAGE IN TODAY'S LAW WAS BECAUSE THE WAY THAT VETERANS WERE FIFTY. PEOPLE WERE TREATED WHEN THEY CAME BACK FROM THE VIETNAM WAR THERE WAS THE PREFERENCE THAT WE GAVE FOR VIETNAM VETERANS WHOSE BECAUSE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY. THEY WERE QUALIFIED THEY WERE READY TO WIN AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT THEY WERE THE THEY WERE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND THAT WAS JUST A RECENT JUSTICE. AT LEAST SCARE THE PRIVATE EMPLOYEES FOR IF THEY WERE. REGARDED THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY. THAT'S NOT THE CASE NOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE THAT- WERE THE EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE. PEOPLE FROM THE MILITARY BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SO THE KITTY PUBLIC POLICY CURE FOR THE EXCEPTION OF WE HAVE NOW WAS A REAL- QUANTIFIABLE EVIDENCE THIS. WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE I GUESS IF EMPLOYERS WANT EMPLOYEES VETERANS THEYCAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO HOME THERE IT'S I'VE NEVER HEARD IN THE RECENT YEARS THAT THERE'S SOME ACTIVITY THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT HIRING VETERANS. AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER. QUALIFIED FOR THE FOLKS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE NUMBER NINE THERE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO RESPOND TO THAT OR ADDRESS IT YOU'RE RIGHT ALLEN'S THIS POINT IN TIME THAT VETERAN UNEMPLOYMENT IS PROBABLY ON PAR AND MAYBE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION TODAY BUT HISTORICALLY THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN YOUR RIGHTS IN A WHITE CAL SKI THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY THE FIRST TIME I PUT ON A UNIFORM ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS IS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SOMEONE CAME WARRANT SPIT UPON ME. WAS A DIFFERENT TIME WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO COMING BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN. WHERE PEOPLE WERE LINED UP TO THANK YOU. A VERY DIFFERENT TIME BUT EVEN THOUGH FOLKS ARE LINED UP TO THANK YOU. I WAS IN A DIFFERENT POSITION BUT I DEALT WITH MANY YOUNG PEOPLE. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TRANSITIONING. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS DESIGNED TO DO YES YES WE ARE HONORING THEIR SACRIFICE. YES WE ARE PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL. POINT OF ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF TRANSITION AND YES IT IS A SOCIETAL DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE PROVIDE THAT INCENTIVE. IT'S IT IS I MEAN I RECOGNIZE THAT SOME. DON'T THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA. I DO. ONE FINAL QUESTION THE WHOLE MAIN OPPOSITION RAISED THE POINT THAT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR WE HAVE MUCH MORE OVERSIGHT SO THAT THAT SOMEBODY A. D. E. D. YEARS NOT DISCRIMINATING ABOUTTHAT BUT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE HAVE SO MANY MORE JOBS. AND THAT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MISUSE OF THIS LAW THE INTENTION LAW IS GREATER- AND THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD. WELL IT IS IT'S A IT'S A POINT THAT THEY REYES AGAINST RESONATES WITH ME WILL WORK. HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS MORE OVERSIGHT IN THE FOR LACK OF OVERSIGHT IN THE DETECTOR THE SAME THE SAME POINT IS MADE EARLIER IF THERE'S A SUBTERFUGE IF PEOPLE IF THERE'S A BUSINESS THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE ONLY GONNA HIRE WHITE MALES. I'M GONNA USE THE VETERANS PREFERENCES SOME SORT OF A SUBTERFUGE TO HIRE ONLY WHITE MALES. THEN AGAIN. I SUPPOSE WE CAN FIND LANGUAGE TO INCLUDE THE BILL IF YOU FIND THAT IS BEING USES SUBTERFUGE I DON'T MEAN. IT PEOPLE WANT TO GO OUT AND HIRE WHITE MALES THEY DON'T NEED TO HIRE THEY DON'T NEED TO FIND A VETERAN'S PREFERENCE BAKED THEY CAN DO IT. AND. ONE OF FALL OF OTHER LAWS AS WELL. THE YOUR DISK. AGAINST PROTECTED CLASSES WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A VETERAN'S PREFERENCE OR NOT YOU'RE STILL VIOLATING THE LAW. SECOND COULD YOU REMARKS OR QUESTIONS NOT FOR TONIGHT THANK YOU CENTER CRASKE MOVING ON TO SENATOR- WIENER AND THEN CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A DETERRENT I'M- HI. I THOUGHT IT'S A VERY SIMILAR TO SENATOR- TO ROSSO'S IN ON A SUPPORT THE HE GOES ON THE BILL TODAY AND I THINK THERE'S A REALLY FOR A LOT OF LOCAL HERE AND SUPPORTING. OUR VETERANS OUT HI BUT THERE ARE RISKS OF THE AUTHOR. THE KNOWLEDGE AS I THINK THOSE RISKS PROBABLY WILL GRADUALLY. SHIFT OVER TIME- BUT IT IS. THE MILITARY IS A SLOW MOVING- INSTITUTION UNFORTUNATELY- AND I'M GLAD OF THE AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR SITTING DOWN TO MEET WITH- ORGANIZATIONS. I THINK HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE WE WANT TO SUPPORT VETERANS BUT THE TWO HAVE. OUR CONCERNS ON OPTIMISTIC THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH. THOSE ISSUES I DO WANT TO SAY THAT- YOU KNOW IT OBVIOUSLY VETERANS ARE VERY VERY DIVERSE. PUTTING A DOZEN TERMS OF ERROR LINE LIFE VERY DIVERSE SERVER INTERNS WHO WERE DOING WHO DO EXCEPTIONALLY WELL- I SUSPECT THAT THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO BE THE BENEFICIARIES. OF THIS BILL AND THAT THE BENEFICIARIES ARE PROBABLY MORE LIKELY TO BE VETERANS WHO MAYBE ARE STRUGGLING. WITH EMPLOYMENT I CAN'T SAY THAT WITH CERTAINTY BUT THIS IS WHAT MY GUT. TELLS ME UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT OF. VETERANS WHO REALLY REALLY STRUGGLE- BECAUSE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND ADDICTION ISSUES AND TRAUMA- FIFTH INABILITY TO RE INTEGRATE- PARTICULARLY COMBAT. VETERANS SOLDIERS SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES WITH THE- FOLKS THAT HAVE CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER WINNER MOVING ONTO CENTRE. CABALLERO THAN SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I REALLY. WANT TO SECOND WHAT- MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO HAD TO SAY I AM I AM I AM SENSITIVE TO THE END AND INTENDED POSSIBILITY OF DISCRIMINATION- AT BUT I ALSO KNOW- AND HAVE A HAD A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH VETERANS ARE REALLY ARE STRUGGLING AND WHO ARE LOOKING TRYING TO FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE ORLD COMING BACK- SOME AFTER DIFFICULT DEPLOYMENTS AND SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL AND HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT. WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE IF THERE'S A SWEET SPOT THERE I YOU KNOW I THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT. THAT FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF GOOD AND- AND SO I'M I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT AS WELL AND WE APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN A MINUTE SPORTED TODAY. THANK YOU SENATE GOVERNOR THANK YOU CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN CENTER NUMBER ONE OF THANK YOU FOR PICKING THIS UP AS IMPORTANT- ISSUE. AS CENTER ACCOUNTS HE- POINTED OUT THIS BILL HAS BEEN PRESENTED THREE TIMES TO THIS COMMITTEE- PRESENTED BY TWO- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FROM THE SEVENTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND SENT TO DIFFERENT ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. FROM THE SEVENTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO- ONE WHO HAPPENS TO BE A COMBAT VETERAN. VIETNAM ERA VETERAN. AND MYSELF THE SON OF A VETERAN AND THE GRANDSON. OF A P. O. W. VETERANS SO. I PERSONALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THIS UP AND- RECOGNIZE THAT THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS FINALLY CATCHING UP WITH THE ASSEMBLY THE FULL ASSEMBLY. BECAUSE ALL THREE TIMES IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY- THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR CAME TO THIS COMMITTEE TO- ALL THREE TIMES DIE IN IT INGLORIOUS DEATH. SO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE BILL AND AS A VETERAN- HONOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY THANK YOU. AND HOPE THAT IT WILL PASS OUT TODAY AND I WOULD. ASK TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR- IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL WHEN THERE'S NOT A TEAM OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN SAID LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE AUTHOR- BECAUSE OF HIS COMMITMENT IS CLEAR. AND HIS COMMITMENT IS TRUST IN THIS- I THINK THAT THE A MALL LITTLE. I THINK THE DEBATE COULD PUT A FINER POINT ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES IF YOU LOOK AT THE. OUR IS A TELLING- THE AUTHOR THAT YEARS AGO WHEN I WORKED IN COUNTY MANAGEMENT WE HAD A VETERANS PREFERENCE AND YES THIS WAS AT THE TIME THAT DIVERSITY WAS NOT WHAT IT IS NOW IT IS IN IN THE MILITARY. AND WE HAD A RULE OF THREE SO WHENEVER A JOB WAS VACANT THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES WERE SENT BECAUSE THERE WAS A VETERANS PREFERENCE MANY TIMES ALL THE CANDIDATES BUNCHED TOGETHER THE THREE THAT WERE VETERANS MOVED TO THE TOP AT THE TIME THEY WERE ALMOST UNIFORMLY WHITE MEN AND WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO DIVERSIFY THE WORK FORCE THE VETERANS PREFERENCE WORKED AGAINST IT. AND SO WHEN OF WE DID A REFORM WE SAID THAT YOU SENT TEN NAMES ON EVERY LIST AND YOU HAVE TO INTERVIEW EVERYBODY THAT'S ABOVE WHOEVER YOU OFFER THE JOB TO AND AS A RESULT WE WERE ABLE TO REACH WOMEN BUT WERE MAKE SURE THE VETERANS WERE GIVEN A FAIR SHOT AND MANY TIMES THEY WERE. IN FACT HIRED. AND SO WHEN IT IS SAID IN THIS DEBATE THAT- IT YOU KNOW THERE'S NO INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION THAT WASN'T INTENTIONAL THAT WAS UNINTENTIONAL ALL THE WAY IN ONE INCIDENT WERE MAYBE YOU COULD PROTECT AGAINST SUBTERFUGE THERE WAS NO SUBTERFUGE THAT WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE BASIS OF HOW PEOPLE LINED UP. AN ENORMOUS EATING AND THE AUTHOR CAN CORRECT ME YOU SEE I THINK THE HEART OF THE DEBATE IS SET AT THAT TIME WE DID NOT HAVE A DIVERSE- OF CATEGORY OR GROUP OF VETERANS- WHILE THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. THEY WERE OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE THEY'RE ALMOST ENTIRELY MEN THERE WAS NOBODY THAT WAS GAY THAT IF YOU WERE TRYING TO HAVE A DIVERSE WORK FORCE. VETERANS PREFERENCE WORKED AGAINST IT. AND YET NOW THE ARGUMENT THAT IS BEING MADE BY THE AUTHOR. IS THAT IF YOU LOOK WHO'S COMING OUT OF THE MILITARY RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY DIVERSE AND IT'S REPRESENTED ALMOST TO WHERE THE POPULATION IS. AND YET IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE POOL OF VETERANS THAT MAY APPLY THAT DIVERSITY DOESN'T EXIST AND IN THE IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY. THAT WE COULD GIVE SOME PREFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE MILITARY NOW AND WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE ISSUE THAT WE ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT. AND WHEN I WAS SECRETARY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND WE HAVE THE CONSERVATION CORPS WHICH REALLY WAS HELPING PEOPLE THAT WERE STRUGGLING WE HAVE DEDICATED. OUR OF PIECES OF THE CORD THAT WERE FOR TURNING VETERANS AND AS A RESULT- WE WERE ABLE TO HIRE OR TRAIN PEOPLE THAT THEN WENT TO HIRE. MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE EXACTLY THE ONES THAT THE AUTHOR IS TALKING ABOUT AND THAT GROUP WAS DIVERSE AND THAT GROUP WAS IN NEED. AND SO WITH OUR DISADVANTAGING ANYBODY ELSE WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW. TO HAVE VETERANS THAT WERE IN VETERANS BACK TRAIL CREWS OTHER THINGS THAT MET THAT NEED AND IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WOULD MORE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE. AND IT YOU KNOW THAT AND I'M DISAPPOINTED IN PARTS OF THE DEBATE BECAUSE- THE SYSTEM NOBODY EVER INTENTIONALLY. DISCRIMINATED IT WAS ALL UNINTENTIONAL AND YES MANY MANY GOVERNMENTS HAVE THIS BUT MANY GOVERNMENTS FIGURED OUT A WAY. THAT THEY COULD STILL BE FAIR TO THE ENTIRE POOL OF CANDIDATES. A. N. N. SO IT LEAVES THIS VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION ON THIS BILL BECAUSE I WANT TO HONOR THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT WHICH IS WHICH IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND S. AND YET IF THIS BILL. MORE COME BACK US IN THE CURRENT FORM I COULD NOT VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RESOLVE. THE ISSUE OF DISH PAIRED IMPACT IN A PSYCH I ACTUALLY THINK IT WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF IN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHO'S COMING OUT OF THE MILITARY NOW. AND THEY JUST GO ONE GENERATION. I THINK IT WILL MATCH MUCH MORE THE GENERAL POPULATION AND SO THERE HAVE TO BE SOME WAYS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH WHO'S COMING OUT OF THE MILITARY NOW. WHO ARE VERY DIVERSE. AT THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT SO I'M TORN WHETHER TO NOT VOTE FOR IT. OR FIGURE OUT. HOW THE AUTHOR pAFTER SOME OF THESE MEETINGS DOES IT BUT IF IT'S A SUBTERFUGE AMENDMENT OR IT STILL COMES BACK WITH TE SAME KIND OF THING THAT THE LARGER POOL THAT'S NOT THE FIRST. IS GIVEN PREFERENCE THAT STILL DOESN'T WORK SO A I'M STILL TORN RIGHT NOW WHETHER TO VOTE NO. OR IF I HAD A SENSE THAT THERE WAS A PLACE TO GO AND I HAVEN'T HEARD YET THERE'S A PLACE TO GO WE VERY CLEARLY SAID WHERE THE PROBLEM WAS. BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD. A PLACE TO GO THAT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM SO THAT'S MY CONCERN AND- I'M NOT SURE HOW I'M GONNA VOTE AND TELL THE ROLES CALLED BUT IT'S OF. IT BUT I WOULDN'T EVEN IF I END UP VOTING FOR TO GIVE THE AUTHOR CHANCE TO FIX THIS. I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR IN ANY FUTURE ITERATION UNLESS IT TO REST ADDRESSES THE BASIC ISSUE. OF THE DESPAIRED IMPACT IN A LARGER POOL. THANK YOU CENTRAL- MOVING ON CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU IS IN A CENTER AND SALAS. I FORGOT TO- THANK YOU SENATE IT'S ALSO THE FIRST CLASS RECORDED. THAT'S OKAY WE'RE MOVING ON THE CENTRE GONZALEZ OKAY THANK YOU MR JERRY PRITCHETT THAT AND- I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR SPENDING TIME WITH- WITH ME PERSONALLY YESTERDAY AND- CERTAINLY- UNDERSTAND- WORRIES COMING FROM AND HIS EXPERIENCE AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL CLEARLY- BUT I TO I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY- CONCERN AS WELL FOR THE DISPARATE- ISSUE AND ENSURING THAT YOU KNOW WE AREN'T. DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OTHER- CLASSES BUT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW GIVEN THIS INFORMATION AND I KNOW THAT YOU CONTINUE WORKING WITH- THE OPPOSITION ON THIS- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ACTUALLY- ENSURING THAT VETERANS DO HAVE ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH A VERY VERY TOUGH IME- I ALSO TO COME FROM A BIG VETERAN FAMILY FROM MY GRANDFATHER TO MY COUSINS TO. GET ABOUT TEN OF THEM IN THE GONZALEZ FAMILY ARE ALL VETERANS. AND ALL LATINO AND I'M I'M REALLY REALLY APPRECIATIVE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP- THIS ISSUE. I CAN SAY THOUGH THAT- IN SOME WAYS YOU KNOW THERE COULD BE A BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION OF COURSE FOR THIS- IN THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW MILITARY EXPERIENCE CAN GIVE YOU YOU KNOW A LOT OF I'M GOOD MANAGEMENT SKILLS PERFORMANCE ON THE JOB AT CETERA ETCETERA BUT- IT'S STILL IN MY OPINION CAN LEAVE SO MANY PEOPLE BEHIND IN SOME WAYS SO. ALL UP STAINED OF FOR NOW- I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS AND I WOULD JUST LOVE TO CONTINUE- HEARING MORE ABOUT IN THE NEXT STEPS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR GONZALEZ I CAN'T RECALL A BILL WHERE EVERYONE COMMENTED ON. DO WE WANT TO GO FOR NUMBER. THREE SENATOR WIENER SUMMER ONE. THE FIRST ONE A DEFERRED- BUT ONE CARRIAGES ACTUALLY FORGOT TO FORGET BECAUSE I FORGOT TO MENTION. THAT IN TERMS OF THE DISPARATE IMPACTS ON SPECIFICALLY ON THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. OUR COMMUNITY IS IN A LITTLE BIT OF A UNIQUE POSITION WITH THE MILITARY BECAUSE WE WERE. COMPLETELY BANS UNLIKE OTHER COMMUNITIES BUT UNLIKE OTHER UNLIKE MOST MOST OTHER PEOPLE- WE WERE STILL ABLE TO SERVE BECAUSE PEOPLE CHEST. I HID WHO THEY WERE. AND THAT WAS THAT WAY FOREVER SO THERE ARE ALWAYS BEEN. ATTRIBUTED TO PEOPLE. ABUNDANTLY IN THE MILITARY WHO TRAGICALLY HAD TO SUPPRESS WHO THEY WERE AND LIVE IN FEAR- AND AT TIMES BE KICKED OUT AND HAVE THEIR LIVES UPENDED. UNTIL THE WHOLE POLICY WAS REPEALED. BUT I. DID SOME LOOKING AND I THINK THERE ARE. APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION- LGBTQ VETERANS IN THE U. US IT MIGHT BE MORE AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT. BY DEFEATED- THAT NUMBER OF US FOR A FEW YEARS BACK SO MAYBE. HIGHER NOW WITH A MILLION OUT OF. I THINK ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION OR THEREABOUTS VETERANS OVERALL SO IT'S ABOUT ALMOST. ABOUT A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT- AND SO ON I DO THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF LGBTQ PEOPLE FRANKLY CAN. BENEFIT FROM THAT SO IT'S A UNIQUE. SITUATION THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS AND I'M- I'M NOT DISMISSING THE CHALLENGES BECAUSE THE MILITARY WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC. TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITY FOR SO MANY YEARS BUT I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT. OUT THERE IS A CONVERSATION MOVES FORWARD. THE YOU. I'D LIKE TO A QUESTION- TWO TO THE AUTHOR MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS A VOLUNTARY. PROGRAM THAT THE- THAT'S CORRECT GET YOU YOU'RE NOT FOUR STAR VETERANS ARE SO THIS THEIR ONES AND MAKE SURE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT THIS IS NOT PUBLIC POLICY THROUGH A MANDATE BUT SOMETHING THAT IS VOLUNTARY SO I THINK THE SOCIETAL IMPACTS EVEN THOSE ADDICTS HAVE EXPRESSED MERITORIOUS CONCERNS WILL BE MITIGATED TO SOME DEGREE. BONTA MY SECOND POINT IS. I THINK FIVE ONE OF THE APPRECIATIONS THAT. OUR COMMUNITY HAS SHOWN TO THOSE WHO HAVE. SACRIFICED THEIR MILITARY SERVICE. IS FINDING WAYS TO RE INTEGRATE THOSE PERSON THOSE FOLKS. INTO CIVILIAN LIFE AGAIN. I DON'T WANT TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT. THE BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE DERIVED AS A COMMUNITY AS A STATE AND AS A COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE PROVIDED THROUGH THE ARM SERVICES IN THE ARMED FORCES. AND I ALSO LOOK AT THIS AS IF THIS IS HELPFUL TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE- SACRIFICED OFTEN- ON THE BATTLEFIELD THAT WE LOOK UPON THIS AS IN ADDED A SENSE OF APPRECIATION SO I'VE I WILL CERTAINLY- SUPPORT THIS. NOT TODAY IF- THE AUTHORS WILLING I'D LIKE ALSO. VOWED TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN REQUESTING- TO BE ADDED ON- SO WITH THAT- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING DYNAMICS. THAT GO INTO THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK YOU CLEARLY LAID OUT. THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT GROUPS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BENEFIT. FROM THIS IN WAYS THAT- WE MAY NOT NECESSARILY ANTICIPATE OR WERE APPRECIATED A COMMON LEVEL. IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HISPANIC POPULATIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATIONS THAT COMPRISE A LARGER SEGMENT OF THE WORKFORCE IN THOSE IN FINANCIAL NEED IN NEEDING. THAT THOSE- THOSE FOR VERTICAL OPPORTUNITIES IN SOCIETY SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE WITHOUT CONTROVERSY BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. HOW IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THE NUMBER THANK YOU CENTER BOARD JUST IN TWO. WELL MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S COMMENTS IT. THE MILITARY WAS WRONG AS AN INSTITUTION TO DISCRIMINATE WASN'T JUST WRONG WAS STUPID IT WAS ANTITHETICAL THE NATIONAL DEFENSE DISCRIMINATE ON IT AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT THAT- COVERT OF. LGBTQ VETERANS EXPANDS BECAUSE AS PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE AFTER THEY'VE LEFT THE MILITARY SERVICE AND NO LONGER FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO HIDE THEIR IDENTITY THEY WILL IDENTIFY AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT. THIS WILL BENEFIT A BROADER CROSS SECTION AND SOME PEOPLE ARE EVEN AWARE TO DAY- SADLY WE CAN'T GO BACK IN TIME AND FIX SOME OF THOSE THINGS SADLY WE CAN'T GO BACK IN TIME AND CHANGE HOW THE MILITARY BEHAVED TOWARDS WOMEN FORTY YEARS AGO. IT IS DIFFERENT TODAY THE QUESTION IS BECAUSE THE INSTITUTION DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS FOR EXAMPLE BEFORE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. SOLDIER WHO'S LEAVING SERVICE TODAY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO THAT PERSON WHO'S LEAVING SERVICE IT IS TRANSITIONING JUST LEAVING IRAQ JUST LEAVING AFGHANISTAN COMING BACK STRUGGLING WITH. ALL SORTS OF THINGS- DO WE HAVE A SOCIETAL OBLIGATION TO SAY TO THAT PERSON LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THAT BRIDGE I THINK WE DO. ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU I DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON SB SIX SIX FIVE. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR JONES- THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED IN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON MILITARY.

BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRE. IN SOME IF NOT MANY CASES COST PROHIBITIVE PROBATE OR ESTATE PLANNING ATTORNEY CONSULTATION. ONE OF THE OTHER WAYS PARTICULAR TO THE PARTICULAR THOSE WITHOUT RESOURCES. THE RIGHT IS A REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED A REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED PROVIDES A- MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE MECHANISM. OTHER THAN PROBATE. FOR THOSE WHO MAY OTHERWISE HAVE LIMITED OPTIONS IT'S ANOTHER TOOL. AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITH LIMITED OPTIONS SO OFTEN THOSE WITH LIMITED ACCESS ASSETS RATHER UNCOMPLICATED HOLDINGS AND A HOME. THE REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT WAS AB ONE THREE NINE. TO ALLOW OWNERS OF REAL PROPERTY TO TRANSFER THEIR PROPERTY UPON DEATH. I DON'T SIDE OF THE NORMAL PROBATE PROCEDURE. THIS PILOT PROGRAM ORIGINALLY HAD A SUNSET DATE OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT WAS EXTENDED LAST YEAR ONE YEAR DUE TO COVERED THIS BILL SENATE BILL THREE FIFTEEN FURTHER EXTENDS THE SUNSET DATE.

IT WILL ALLOW THE USE OF A REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEED TO TRANSFER REAL PROPERTY TO A PUBLIC ENTITY PRIVATE NONPROFIT ENTITY OR TRUST IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER PROVISIONS. IT WILL STRENGTHEN TRANSFER AND BENEFICIARY PROTECTIONS SUCH AS REQUIRING THE DEED TO BE SIGNED BY TWO WITNESSES REQUIRING THE BENEFICIARY TO GIVE NOTICE TO THE TRANSFER WORSE ERRORS WHEN THE TRANSFER OR DIES. AND IT WILL ALLOW COURTS THE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE A TRANSFORMERS INTENT IF A PARTICULAR ISSUE ARISES WITH THE TRANSFER DOCUMENTS HE WILL RESTRUCTURE THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE BENEFICIARIES LIABILITY FOR THE DECEASED TRANSFORMERS AND SECURE DEBTS. HE WILL GIVE THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION ADDITIONAL TIME TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF THE REVOCABLE TRANSFER ON DEATH DEEDS EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE NEW REFORMS AND MAKE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS.

BUT AT LEAST OUR OFFICES SO. CENTER WIENER S. B. TWO FIVE TWO. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. HELLO AND THANK YOU TO YOU IN THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO SP TWO FIFTY TWO FOR CALLING SINCE LEGISLATION WILL BAN- THE UNNECESSARY USE OF DOGS AND CATS AND TOXICITY TESTS CONDUCTED IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT TOXICITY TESTING THAT'S REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AND DOES NOT IMPACTS ON A TESTING BEING DONE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH BAXEEN DEVELOPMENT PET PRODUCTS AND MEDICAL DEVICE TESTING TOXICITY TESTING. INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE FORCE FEEDING OR INJECTING ANIMALS WITH HARMFUL CHEMICALS OR PRODUCTS TO EVALUATE- VIA FAX THE DISCOVERED CHEMICALS MIGHT HAVE ON HUMANS- SOME TESTS INVOLVE OVERDOSING DOGS. AND ADMINISTERING CHEMICALS OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD CAUSING SLOW AND HORRIFIC PAIN. ANIMALS ARE OBSERVED FOR TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS RANGING FROM VOMITING AND BLEEDING TO TUMORS AND EVEN DEATH. BY DOGS AND CATS SUFFER GREATLY FROM THIS TOXICITY TESTING WHICH WE ALSO NOW KNOW IT'S LARGELY INEFFECTIVE AND NOT SUPPORTIVE BY CURRENT SCIENCE. A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DOG STUDIES PRODUCE HIGH LEVELS OF FALSE NEGATIVES. WHICH OCCUR WHEN A PRODUCT APPEARS TO BE SAFE AND DOGS BUT IS FOUND TO BE HARMFUL IN HUMANS. DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 90% OF DRUGS FIRST TESTED ON ANIMALS FAIL WHEN SUBSEQUENTLY TESTED IN PEOPLE. RESEARCHERS HAVE EVEN EQUATED PREDICTIONS OF TOXICITY BASED ON CANINE DATA. TO SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN TOSSING A COIN. TOXICITY TESTS DO NOT ENSURE HUMAN SAFETY AND COMPLETELY DISREGARD CANINE AND FELINE LIVES. BY THIS BILL AS WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY TO PROHIBIT TAXES CITY TESTING CARRIED ON DOGS AND CATS THAT SERVES NO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. COMPANIES CONDUCT THIS TYPE OF TESTING NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO USE DOGS OR CATS BUT BECAUSE- THERE IS PRECEDENT AND CONVENIENCE WHICH FRANKLY DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY THESE ANIMALS. AS TESTING IS CONDUCTED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND PRIVATE LIVES. AND THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT WHAT TESTS ARE CONDUCTING AND WHY. FOR INSTANCE DURING THE ONE YEAR PESTICIDE TESTS ON DOGS RESEARCHERS FOR STOCKS TO CONSUME PESTICIDE EVERY DAY FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. ALL THE DOGS ARE KILLED AT THE END OF THE STUDY IF THEY DO NOT DIE DURING THE STUDY. THE EPA ELIMINATED THIS TEST REQUIREMENT MORE THAN A DECADE AGO YOUR COMPANY STILL CARRY OUT THIS TASK DESPITE IT NOT BEING REQUIRED- AND THEY SUBMIT THE DATA AS PART OF THEIR PESTICIDE REGISTRATION. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN ALTERNATIVE TESTING METHODS WHICH REPLACE ANIMAL TESTING WITH NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY EXAMPLES INCLUDE USING LAB GROWN HUMAN TISSUE INSTEAD OF LIVE ANIMALS AND USING COMPUTER MODELING TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF A HARMFUL CHEMICAL. THEY'RE ALREADY EFFORTS TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO ALTERNATIVE TESTING ON A NATIONAL LEVEL THE EPA HAS COMMITTED TO ELIMINATE ALL ANIMAL TESTING FOR PESTICIDES AND CHEMICALS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THE FDA HAS ALSO EMBRACED ALTERNATIVE TESTING BY RELEASING A- PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY ROADMAP AND FORMING AN ALTERNATIVE METHODS WORKING GROUP- WE'RE WORKING WITH CONCERNED GROUPS INCLUDING SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. TO ENSURE THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT IF THE FDA REQUIRES- DOG CAUGHT TESTING FOR DRUG APPROVAL BY THE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BAN NOT IF IT IS REQUIRED BY THE FDA- AND SO WE'RE GOING TO WORK TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE. AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS CLEAR THIS IS A STEP TOWARDS MORE TO ABOUT- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE COUGHING CONLEY- VICE PRESIDENT OF ANIMAL RESEARCH ISSUES OF HUMANE SOCIETY- SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. AND THEN DR BARBARA HODGES A VETERINARIAN WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO ON THE LINE IN CASE QUESTIONS COME UP. MY DAUGHTER JERRY BAILEY WHO IS A RESEARCHER ON IN THIS AREA THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER LET'S START WITH MISS CONNELLY IS MISS CONNELLY ON THE LINE. I DO NOT FRIEDMAN CURRENTLY ON THE LINE HERE LET'S TURN TO DR BARBARA HODGES AND APOS CALMLY THEN APPEARS THAT WILL COME BACK TO HER. SO DR HI. IS DOCTOR HODGES YET. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN THANK YOU DOCTOR HODGES OKAY GREAT GO AHEAD GREAT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS IS DOCTOR BARBARA HODGES THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARIAN PRACTICING SMALL ANIMAL MEDICINE FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AND WORKING EXCLUSIVELY WITH DOG AND CAT PATIENTS. TODAY I REPRESENT THE HUMANE SOCIETY VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WITH APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND VETERINARY MEMBERS NATIONWIDE INCLUDING NEARLY TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB TWO FIVE TWO WHICH WOULD AND CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY TOXICITY TESTING ON DOGS AND CATS IN CALIFORNIA. DURING THE TESTING ANIMALS ARE EXPOSED TO DRUGS PESTICIDES AND OTHER CHEMICALS AND ARE THEN OBSERVED FOR HARMFUL EFFECTS. SUCH AS VOMITING SEIZURES DIFFICULTY BREATHING HEART FAILURE AND EVEN DEATH. AFTER HE STUDIED ANIMAL SUBJECTS ARE OFTEN KILLED SO THAT THEIR TISSUES AND ORGANS CAN BE EXAMINED. IS IN FACT A CORE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM TESTING IN ANIMALS AND REAL WORLD OUTCOMES IN HUMANS SB TWO FIVE TWO ENCOURAGES HUMAN RELEVANCE NON ANIMAL TESTING METHODS WHILE PROVIDING EXTENSION FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH AND THOSE TOXICITY TESTS. FEDERALLY MANDATED USE ANIMAL TESTING OF MEDICATIONS AND PRODUCT MEANT FOR DOGS AND CATS THEMSELVES WOULD ALSO NOT BE IMPACTED. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF ANIMAL WELFARE LEADERSHIP INCLUDING PASSAGE OF THE FIRST STATEWIDE LEGISLATION TO END THE SALE OF ANIMAL TESTED COSMETICS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SB TWO FIVE TWO ENCOURAGES THE USE OF NON ANIMAL TOXICITY TESTING ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD MORE EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARD HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE STRONG EMPATHIC BOND THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE WITH. COMPANION DOGS AND CATS. WE URGE YOU HUMANE INTO THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU DOCTOR HODGES IS MISS CONNELLY ONLINE. I DO NOT CURRENTLY ON THE LINE. ACCORDING TO MY- MISTER GRIMM I STAFF- SHE WAS TRYING TO SPEAK BUT IT WASN'T. WORKING SHE WAS IN HER FOR SOME REASON BUT SHE ALSO ON IT THIS CONLEY WHY DON'T WE TURN TO OTHERS IN SUPPORT AND IF MISS CONNELLY THEN.

HE FURTHER THOSE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION IS THERE IT IS A PRINCIPAL OR PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WILL PROVIDE A PERSON TWO MINUTES. IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION OF IT. THE BILL PLEASE PUSH ONE THEN IF ZERO. WE DO HAVE SOMEBODY PEELING UP HERE IT'LL BE JUST ONE MOMENT. ALL RIGHT. AND WE WILL GO TO THE LINE OF IT THREE OH TWO YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS MY NAME IS BEING- HILO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION. STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING LIFE SCIENCES SECTOR. HE COMMUNITY EMPLOYING MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STATE. I MEAN BY TAKING YOU MISTER CHAIR THE COMMITTEE SENATOR WIENER AN EXTRAPOLATE YOU MIGHT PASS ON UNITED'S. REFLECTED AND DENOUNCES. FORTUNATELY WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO LESSEN THE NEED FOR THE REGION'S INDICATE INSTEAD ANALYSIS. CALIFORNIA IS THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. BUT MORE RESEARCH DONE HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. LEAVE THAT TO THE WAY THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN COULD BE JUMPED OUT THROUGHOUT YOUR INDUSTRY. IN INDIA OUR ABILITY. TO CONDUCT THE REQUIRED RESURGENT ABOUT- THE LAST YEAR I. STEPPED UP THE RESEARCH THE BALLOT NINETEEN. HUNDREDS OF VACCINES AND THERAPIES IN DEVELOPMENT TO COMBAT THE DEADLY PANDEMIC. THANK ANIMAL RESEARCH FOR THAT. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM THAT MAKE IT TO HUMAN TRIALS ARE FIRST TESTED IN AND OUT. YEAH YEAH OFTEN REQUIRED TO TEST ON RESIDENTS ANY NON READ SPECIES. OUR MEMBERSHIP USED TO BE A. MODEL FOR THAT DISEASE. ASIAN IS IN COURT WITH FDA. HOWEVER THE WAY THIS GOES WRITTEN OUR MEMBERSHIP WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO TEST ON DOGS OR CATS IN THE STATE TO BRING A DRUG TO MARKET. THE PROPOSAL IT SEE I THINK MEMBERS HAVING TO DO SO IN OTHER STATES THUS REMOVING COVETED. RESEARCH OUT OF CALIFORNIA. NINE A COMPANY SUED THE FDA BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO ANIMAL TESTING ON TALKS. LAST YEAR THE COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF THE FDA. IT WAS DECIDED THAT ANIMAL TESTING WAS NECESSARY. ANALYSTS HAD INVESTIGATION AND I'M ATTACHING ON DOCKS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE. BUT WE MUST MAKE SURE THIS WILL NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON POINTY. FOR TO CONTINUE IN% CONVERSATION WITH THE OFFICE DOCTOR TO ADDRESS CONDITIONAL AMENDMENTS HELP INSURE CALIFORNIA REMAINS THE IDEAL PLACE FOR INNOVATION. RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT SAVE LIVES GLOBALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION ENGINE. THE NEXT LINE IS THREE FORTY FOUR. AND THAT ONE HAS DROPPED- LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO THIS ONE HERE IS COMMONLY APPEARS THEN WE COULD PUT HER ON AS WELL. OKAY WE HAVE A COUPLE HERE QUEUING UP. IT'LL BE JUST ONE MOMENT HERE. OKAY THEN WE COME TO THE LINE OF THREE FORTY SIX. PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING SHARON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M THE PRIMARY TESTIMONY AND I'M SORRY THAT I GOT DISCONNECTED EARLIER ANIMATED DR AMANDA CARSON BANKS FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION I'M HERE WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION FOR S. B. TWO FIFTY TWO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS MY CONCERNS. THE WAY THIS BILL AS WRITTEN IT SEPARATES MEDICAL RESEARCH AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT WITH THE CONSEQUENCE THAT IT WILL NOT ALLOW ANY TESTING ON CATS AND DOGS TO BRING A DRUG T MARKET THIS IS A CRITICAL PROBLEM IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH IS TO TRANSLATE THE DISCOVERIES OF THE LABORATORY BENCH SPOT THE PATIENT'S BEDSIDE NEXIUM CRESTOR LANTIS CELEBREX TO BRING ABOUT AND MAKE THE NEXT THESE ARE. ALL DRUGS THAT WERE TESTED ON DOT. ECLINICALWORKS ANIMAL. IN THE U. STEP BEFORE CLOSE MAKERS TEST HUMANS. ANIMALS ARE NOT ONLY NEEDED TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MEDICATIONS. THEY ALSO NEEDED TO CHECK THE SAFETY OF PRODUCTS THE PREVENT ANY POTENTIAL HARM. HUMANS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES TO BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH AND TESTING HUNDREDS OF DRUGS AND TREATMENTS DEVELOPING NEW MENUS. ARE NOW WITH TEAM LEADERS AND THAT NAY CLINICS AS WELL HELPING ANIMALS LIVE LONGER HEALTHIER LIVES. AS I MENTIONED LEGALLY IN ORDER FOR THE FDA TO ALLOW DRUG MAKERS BEGIN TRIAL NEWMAN. IT REQUIRES FIRST TESTING WITH THE ROAD. AND THEN A NON ROAD TO SPECIES. BASIC SPECIALIST ON THE NONVOTING SPECIES ARE CONFIDENTIAL BUT THEY ARE IN THE INFANCY OF THE PATENT PROCESS. AS SUCH THERE'S NO WAY FOR A MANUFACTURED TO SHOW WHAT THE FDA HAS RECOMMENDED. MANY OF THESE NON RODENT SPECIES MUST BE A DOG OR CAT AS THE OTHER SIDE TYPICALLY BEST SUITED MODEL. WHILE I'M SPEAKING ABOUT RESEARCH WITH CATS AN DOGS TODAY IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT 95% OF ALL RESEARCH. CONDUCTED WITH ANIMALS IN THE NINE STATES OF RODENTS RATS AND MICE. DOGS AND CATS TOGETHER ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN. 1% OF ALL THE SEARCH ANIMAL. IN CLOSING NOT FOR THAT WE'RE- IN A- CAN. FEEDBACK THESE NEW TREATMENTS. THEY WOULD NEVER TO PAY THAT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A- RESEARCH. STOPPING AND I'M RESEARCH. SSI SIGHTED AND COULD HINDER OUR ABILITY TO BRING OUT ABOUT LIFESAVING PRODUCTS TO MARKET. BUT HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OKAY AND THEN. YEAH WE HAVE A LINE. THREE THIRTY TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JIM JACKSON VIACOM CALIFORNIA THANK YOU A CLOSING ARGUMENT THAT. THANK YOU.

OKAY I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THAT NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED BUT THANK YOU CARE- BURKE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TWO FIVE TO THE PAST. FOR THE MOMENT THE TIDY OF THE UNITED STATES I ACTUALLY WORK FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND A PRIMATE BREEDING AND RESEARCH LABORATORY BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN HEALTH AND ANIMAL WELFARE AND I LEFT THE LAND FOR THE SAME REASON. I WANT TO FIRST THIS BILL DOESN'T STOP I'LL ANIMAL TESTING AND RESEARCH IT ONLY IMPACTS LESS THAN 1% OF ALL ANIMALS USED IN THE STATE AND IT'S NOT AT THE L. BAND. ALTHOUGH DOWNTURN HAS ARGUED FOR CODE RESEARCH OR TESTING RELATED YEMEN I THINK YOU FIVE U. S. SEVERAL EXCEPT EXEMPTION IS A VERY NARROW IN FOCUS AND ONLY PROHIBITS TOXICITY TESTING IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS CARRIED OUT ON DOGS AND CATS NOT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. AND FOR PRODUCT MEANT FOR HUMAN. BILL DOES A TO THIRD TALK WITH TESTS ARE. FOOD COLOR AND IT ISN'T DRAW. PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED WHEN THEY IMAGES OF DOGS SUFFERING IN. AND TENTH THEY TELL ME THEY CAN'T IT THE LEGAL AND- RELEASED POLL THAT. FIVE PER OF. OPPOSE TAX TO. ON DOT. IN ADDITION THEIR- THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE OF THE FAILURE OF TOXICITY TESTING ON DONG. SAID THEY'LL YOU I'M NOT ANIMAL ALTERNATIVES SUCH. AS ORGAN ON CHIP TECHNOLOGIES. SURE SOME PILOT AND MUCH MORE IN A CROWD WORK HAPPENING CAL. RESULTSFROM DOCTOR WILL NEVER IMPROVE WELL THE NON ANIMAL TECHNOLOGIES WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO GAIN GROUND. SAVING PRECIOUS TIME AND RESEARCH DOLLARS DR GARY BAILEY OF THE CENTER FOR CONTEMPORARY SCIENCES TO AND ANALYZE DATA FROM OVER TWELVE TWENTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THURMOND HAD DONE DONE IS ON THE LINE IS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS. TAXES TODAY TESTING ON THE IS COMPLIANCE TESTING ANIMALS ISN'T EASY BOX TO CHECK. FOR PRODUCT APPROVAL THERE'S ALSO NO REAL INCENTIVE TO STOP. BUT YOU CAN HELP WITH THAT IF YOU VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB TWO FIVE Q. YOU WILL PROTECT DOGS AND CATS IN PREPAYMENT SAFETY. FOR INNOVATION AND BE APPLAUDED BY YOUR CONSTITUENTS THANK YOU MISS GRAHAM. I HOPE YOUR KIDS DID THAT THANK. YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. FROM OTHERS IN UP. ON THE PHONE WITH YOUR HAVE ANY ON THE AUDIO SIDE ALL RIGHT. MEMORIES ANYONE ELSE ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT IT IS ONE NINE ZERO. WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY IN THE QUEUE AS OF RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT THOSE WILL BE QUEUING UP GREAT THANKS LET'S BRING BACK THE CHAMBER- CENTER WINTER FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL THIS IS A VERY. COMPLEX ISSUE AT LEAST A COMPLEX ISSUE FOR ME- THE ISSUE IS TO IS TO WHAT'S REQUIRED WHAT'S RECOMMENDED- WHERE WE DRAW THE LINE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY IN THIS CHAMBER WHO WISHES TO SEE A DOG OR CAT- SUFFER UNNECESSARILY CERTAINLY- AND MOST OF US DON'T WANT TO SEE HUMANS SUFFER. UNNECESSARILY AND SO WE'RE WE DRAW A LINE THAT'S A THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US. AND IT'S PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING IF IT WAS REQUIRES YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE RAPID TESTING A RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF A PARTICULAR. DRUG FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A PANDEMIC AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT DOG TESTING OR CAT TESTING WAS A PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VACCINE FOR COVERT- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE. A- A BETTER DEFINITION. WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS- WE DON'T AGAIN WANT TO SEE UNNECESSARY TESTING UNNECESSARY HARM TO ANIMALS. BUT WE DO WANT TO SEE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE WAY WITH RESPECT TO LIFE SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT SO HAVING SAID THAT. BACK TO THE CHAMBER OTHER QUESTIONS. CENTER THERE ARE SO. I HAVE A- QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR SURE- THERE IS ONE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED ABOUT- COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. SO IF YOU COULD ARE RESPOND TO THAT- AND THE SPECIFIC ANSWER GATE- WAS- OR A VACCINE OF PHARMACEUTICAL HAS BEEN LICENSED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION- REQUIRING THE USE OF CANINE STUDIES. TO SATISFY EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY REQUIREMENTS. SO IN TERMS OF AXES A TIME OF DRUGS TOPIC SEEMS CONSTRUCTIONS- WE'RE NOT PRECLUDING NOT WITH VACCINES- AND BASICALLY THERE ARE THREE CAUGHT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THREE- IT APPROVING ENTITIES THAT. ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT AROUND THE WORLD THE U. S. THE EUROPEAN UNION AND JAPAN- AND SO- THE QUOTE THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAS TAUGHT AS OUTSIDE YES EVEN IF THE US DOESN'T REQUIRE THE FTA BUT IF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR JAPAN REQUIRES A- THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO AND CALIFORNIA- AND ARE IN MY VIEW ON THAT IS. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING IF THE FTA WERE AND HE HOOKED US UP WILL BE A FIFTY REQUIRES THAT BUT IF THE E. U. OR JAPAN REQUIRES A I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE ALLOWING THE TORTURE OF THESE DOGS IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN DO THE TESTING. ELSEWHERE THINGS WILL DEVELOP THE DRUGS HERE THIS IS NOT GOING TO MEET WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS GONNA LEAVE CALIFORNIA OR STOP WILL BRING DRUGS HERE BECAUSE YOU USE. ARE NEEDED TO TEST ON A DOG AND WE DON'T ALLOW YOUR BILL I IMAGINE DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE IF THEY NEED TO DO THAT- BECAUSE WHAT WE DREW THE LINE THAT WERE OKAY WITH IF THE FDA REQUIRES OF A NOT OF JAPANOR OR OR EUROPE REQUIRES THAT THE DOLLARS THAT. ISSUE AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITION I'M NOT CRITICIZING THEIR POSITION WITHOUT. THAT WAS A STAR TAKE ON. HI THANK UPS CASKEY. I RESPECT GOOD RISK- NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL I HAVE LOTS OF LIVE SIGN FOLKS ON THE- OF THE YEAR- MEDICINE AGENCY THESE OTHER INTERNATIONAL BODIES PUTTING AND DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR WE TALK ABOUT A GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT WE HAVE AND HOW SMALL IT IS SO- I'LL BE PAYING CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE AMEND SAID COMMAND AND THE CLARIFICATION ON WHAT'S RECOMMENDED AND WHAT'S REQUIRED IS THE FATHER WORKS ON. ASSEMBLY CASKEY NO OTHER MICROPHONES UP- SIR WE KNOW YOU CARE CLOSE. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND WE'RE ABSOLUTELY TESTS I HAD ASSUME WITH OF THE LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION ON FRIDAY TO HEAR THEM AL WILL WORK WITH THEM FIRST OF ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ON WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE BILL- THAT IF THE FDA REQUIRES- USE ACCOUNTS OF DOLLARS IN DRUG TESTING THE BILL WOULD ALLOW IT AS WELL- AND SO WILL HAVE THOSE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS BUT FUNDAMENTALLY- THIS IS. AN AREA OF RESEARCH NOT SINCE ABOUT DRUGS BUT ALSO ALL SORTS OF PRODUCTS THAT IS REALLY NEEDS TO AND THAT IS INCREASINGLY VIEWED AS NOT PARTICULARLY USEFUL- AND- WE SHOULD PUT AN END TO A HEARING.
