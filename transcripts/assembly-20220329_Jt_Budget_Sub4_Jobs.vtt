00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.046
IN THEIR OWN STATES AND THE

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:11.082
FIGURE ON PAGE SEVEN SHOWS HOW

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:12.450
THESE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED BY

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:13.718
THE STATE'S ACROSS THE VARIOUS

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.386
TYPES OF PROGRAMS YOU'LL SEE

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:16.854
THAT LOAN PARTICIPATION AND

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:18.956
VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS WERE THE

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.958
MOST POPULAR TYPES OF PROGRAM

00:39:21.592 --> 00:39:22.927
-- CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAMS

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:25.162
WERE AMONG THE LEAST POPULAR

00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:27.465
CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A TOTAL

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:28.599
OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.267
MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY

00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:32.269
TEN S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAM AND

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:33.571
THESE FUNDS WERE SPLIT EQUALLY

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:35.272
BETWEEN THE SMALL BUSINESS --

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.540
FINANCE CENTERS LOAN GUARANTEE

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:39.076
PROGRAM AND THE C. P. C. A PHASE

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:40.945
CAL CAP AND COLLATERAL SUPPORT

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.680
PROGRAMS AND THESE FUNDS ARE

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:44.281
DISTRIBUTED IN THREE TRANCHES

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:45.883
BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.119
SIXTEEN AND THE TABLE ON PAGE

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:49.420
EIGHT PROVIDE SOME SUMMARY

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:51.989
STATISTICS FOR THE S. B. C.

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.324
R. PROGRAM OVERALL NATIONALLY

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.658
AND FOR THE THREE PROGRAMS IN

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:56.460
CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.962
THE STATE CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM

00:39:58.028 --> 00:39:59.463
SUPPORTED A VERY LARGE NUMBER

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.332
OF SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNT LOANS THE

00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:02.399
AVERAGE LOAN WAS ABOUT THIRTY

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:04.368
EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY CAL

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:05.703
CAP PROGRAM ALSO HAS A VERY HIGH

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.638
LEVERAGE RATIO COMMITTING TWENTY

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:08.873
TWO DOLLARS AND PRIVATE FUNDS

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.474
FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR IN PUBLIC

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:13.210
FUNDING IN CONTRAST THE AVERAGE

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:14.578
LOAN SUPPORTED BY THE COLLATERAL

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:16.080
SUPPORT PROGRAM WAS ONE POINT

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:18.549
ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND MUCH

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:20.785
LARGER AND IT HAD A RELATIVELY

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.253
LOW LEVERAGE RATIO LESS THAN

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:23.921
THREE DOLLARS A PRIVATE FUNDS

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:24.955
FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR IN PUBLIC

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:27.491
FUNDING THE LOAN GUARANTEE

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:28.359
PROGRAM WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:29.927
MIDDLE THESE FIGURES IT SUPPORT

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:31.862
A WIDE RANGE OF OF LOANS --

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:34.732
AND AND DOLLAR AMOUNTS THE SPCA

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.133
EXPIRED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.768
AS WE KNOW WHY WE HEAR TODAY'S

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:39.103
RE AUTHORIZED LAST YEAR IN THE

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.205
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT THE

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.139
OTHER SPEAKERS GOING TO TALK

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:43.607
ABOUT THIS A GREAT DEAL SO ALL

00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:44.508
I'M I'M NOT GOING TO ALL THE

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:45.709
DETAILS OF THIS NEW PROGRAM

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:46.844
RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE SOME

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:48.612
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS TO KEEP

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.815
IN MIND FIRST THE TOTAL AMOUNT

00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:52.149
OF FUNDING AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:53.450
ALREADY IS MUCH LARGER THAN

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:54.652
THE TWENTY TEN S. S. B. C. R.

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.554
PROGRAMS ONE POINT TWO ALMOST

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.855
ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:40:58.389 --> 00:40:59.456
COMPARED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:00.724
EIGHT MILLION IN THE FIRST FIRST

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:03.160
ROUND SO AS BEFORE THE FUNDS

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:04.094
ARE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED

00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:06.063
IN THREE TRANCHES AND IN ORDER

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.498
TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDS THE

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:08.699
STATE WILL NEED TO EXPAND EIGHTY

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:11.101
PERCENT OF EACH OF THE FIRST AND

00:41:11.168 --> 00:41:13.437
SECOND TRANCHES AND THEN AS THE

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:14.839
STATE IS EXPANDING THESE FUNDS

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:16.540
THAT MUST COMPLY WITH OTHER

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:17.908
PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS WHICH

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:20.211
INCLUDE EXPANDING AT LEAST FORTY

00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:21.345
NINE PERCENT OF THE FUNDING

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:22.479
FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE OWNED

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:23.848
BY SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:25.249
DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.851
-- WHICH -- MYSELF AND OTHER

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:27.751
PRISONERS MAY REFER TO A

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:30.588
STUDY OR A CD I -- GRAMS

00:41:30.921 --> 00:41:33.290
AND -- ALLS AND

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:35.826
-- ON AVERAGE ACROSS ALL THE

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:36.760
PROGRAMS THE FUNDS NEED TO

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:37.828
BE LEVERAGE FOR TEN DOLLARS

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:39.129
AND PRIVATE FUNDING FOR WEBER

00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:41.198
ONE DOLLAR PUBLIC FUNDING SO

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:42.533
TO SOME EXTENT THESE VARIOUS

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.168
-- REQUIREMENTS WORK AT CROSS

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.103
PURPOSES WITH EACH OTHER TURNING

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.405
TO PAGE TEN WE HAVE SOME --

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:50.007
SOME SOME KEY ISSUES THAT WE

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:52.109
THINK -- FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:54.678
AS YOU -- DEAL WITH THESE

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:55.646
THESE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:57.581
SO THE FIRST IS THAT IMPROVING

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.450
ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:00.251
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:01.652
DIFFICULTY GETTING A LOAN

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.587
-- QUALIFY FOR A LOAN COULD

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:04.989
MAKE IT CHALLENGING TO MEET

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:07.057
THE LEVERAGE GOALS AS THE

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:09.727
BARS OVER ALL RISK INCREASES

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.095
THE AMOUNT THAT MUST BE

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:13.364
OBLIGATED BY THE PUBLIC AGENCY

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.499
INCREASES AS WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:16.767
THE STATE'S CORBETT NINETEEN

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:19.069
DISASTER RELIEF LOAN PROGRAM

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:20.371
REQUIRES THE SMALL BUSINESS

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:22.940
FINANCE CENTER TO ENCUMBER ONE

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.041
DOLLAR FOR EVERY TWO DOLLARS

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:25.409
THAT SLOAN BECAUSE THE PERCEIVED

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:26.877
RISK OF THESE LENSES HIGHER

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:29.413
AND THE S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAMS

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.581
MAY NEED TO ALLOCATE FUNDING

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:31.949
TO PROGRAMS THAT HELP OF HIGH

00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:33.918
AND LOW LEVERAGE RATIOS TO MEET

00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:36.287
THAT TEND TO ONE GOAL HOWEVER

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:37.588
-- PROGRAMS WITH HIGH LEVERAGE

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:39.556
RATIOS MAY IN SOME INSTANCES

00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:41.258
-- BENEFIT BUSINESSES THAT

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:42.326
PERHAPS COULD HAVE QUALIFIED

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:43.861
FOR LOANS ON WITHOUT THE AID

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:46.897
SECOND THE GOAL TO EXPAND --

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:48.132
OBLIGATE THE FUNDING QUICKLY

00:42:48.198 --> 00:42:49.466
COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:51.969
ACHIEVE GOALS THAT HAVE A

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.437
HIGH LEVERAGE RATIO AND TO HELP

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.472
SMALLER BORROWERS SO IF WE JUST

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:56.540
WANTED TO OBLIGATE THE FUNDS

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.108
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE MIGHT

00:42:58.175 --> 00:42:59.410
FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THE LARGER

00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:01.011
LOANS ON THREE PROGRAMS WITH

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:02.947
VERY LOW LEVERAGE RATIO GIVEN

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:04.248
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:05.716
AVAILABLE IT WILL BE CHALLENGING

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:06.984
TO OBLIGATE THESE FUNDS QUICKLY

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:08.352
WHILE RAMPING UP THOSE PROGRAMS

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:11.021
LET CAL CAP THAT -- BENEFITS

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.856
THE SMALLEST BORROWERS BECAUSE

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:15.459
I HAS A VERY HIGH LEVERAGE RATIO

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:16.560
IN THE AVERAGE ABOUT SMALL SO

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:17.828
FOR THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:19.997
THAT YOU'RE DOING -- IT IT

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:21.398
DOESN'T USE AS MUCH OF THE FUNDS

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:23.000
RELATIVELY SPEAKING TO OTHER

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:25.936
PROGRAMS END UP PROGRAMS THAT

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:27.037
THESE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:28.939
SMALL BOAT BUYERS ARE OFTEN

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:30.274
BUSINESSES THAT ARE OWNED BY

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.942
-- SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:34.278
DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS WE

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:35.112
THINK THE STATE MAY WANT TO

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:36.780
CONSIDER WAYS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:38.782
EXPAND SUPPORT FOR BOTH LARGE

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:39.984
BORROWERS AND PROGRAMS THAT

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.952
SUPPORT SMALL FARMERS BUT WE

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:43.220
WILL NEED TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.588
TIME TO MEET ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:49.593
THIRD YOU WILL WANT TO

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:50.894
CONSIDER YOUR TOLERANCE FOR

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.529
RISK SO THE DEFAULT RATES IN

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:54.031
THE EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS HAVE

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:55.866
HISTORICALLY BEEN SOMEWHAT LOWER

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.835
THAN THAT FOR THE SBA'S LOAN

00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:00.504
PROGRAMS HOWEVER IS THE INFLUX

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:02.673
OF SS BCI FUNDING WILL

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.475
REQUIRE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.944
TO GROW AND EXPAND THE NUMBER

00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:09.046
OF OF BUSINESSES THEY SUPPORT HE

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:10.514
MADE SUPPORT LEADING TO HIGHER

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.216
RISK BORROWERS WHO MAY DEFAULT

00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:14.151
ON THEIR LOANS AT HIGHER RATES

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:16.120
AND ULTIMATELY TO THE EXTENT

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:17.955
IT'S EXPECTED EXPANSION FOCUSES

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.423
ON IT CONTINUING TO IMPROVE

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.959
ACCESS TO CREDITS TO CREDIT FOR

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:23.027
BORROWERS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.261
HAVE DIFFICULTY QUALIFYING

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.963
FOR LOANS A SOMEWHAT HIGHER

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.598
DEFAULT RATES MAY BE UNAVOIDABLE

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.834
LASTLY BE MINDFUL THAT THE SPCA

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.302
PROGRAMS WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:33.470
TO U. S. TREASURY OVERSIGHT

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:35.172
REQUIREMENTS THREE TWENTY THIRTY

00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:36.440
SO YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HOW

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.575
YOUR OVERSIGHT OF THESE PROGRAMS

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:39.943
AND YOUR POLICY GUIDANCE TO

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.478
THESE PROGRAMS RELATES THE

00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:42.613
FEDERAL OVERSIGHT DURING THIS

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:44.481
TIME SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU PROBABLY

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:45.749
WOULD WANT TO AVOID ADOPTING A

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:47.184
REQUIREMENT THAT MIGHT CONFLICT

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:49.420
WITH TREASURY GUIDANCE WE ALSO

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:51.021
SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK AHEAD TO

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:52.589
TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND AND

00:44:52.656 --> 00:44:53.557
BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW THE

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:54.925
FUNDS THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.460
FOLLOWING THE REPAYMENT OF

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.895
THESE LOANS ARE REDEPLOYED

00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.797
AND RECYCLED THROUGHOUT THESE

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.532
PROGRAMS SO TO THIS END YOU'LL

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:03.267
LIKELY WANT TO ENSURE THAT

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:04.535
THE PROGRAMS ARE TRANSPARENT

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:06.003
THEY KEEP GOOD RECORDS AND FOR

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.204
EXAMPLE AVOID INTERMINGLING

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:08.772
STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS TOGETHER

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:14.511
AND -- LASTLY --

00:45:14.578 --> 00:45:15.913
CONSIDER THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:17.815
OF ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT

NOT A GREAT THING TO DO

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:18.755

THE CALL OF THE U. S. TREASURY

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:30.640
TO INCREASE SUSTAINABILITY FOR

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.742

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:36.078
FEATURE ALLOWING US TO CONTINUE

THIS POT OF MONEY THAT

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.932
WE'RE RECEIVING THIS TIME IS

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.366
CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THE

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:59.835
FIRST ITERATION APPROXIMATELY

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.871
SIX TIMES THE AMOUNT AS THE

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:04.073
FIRST SO SOME OF THE THINGS

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.075
THAT WE PLAN TO DO AT C. P.

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:08.377
CFA -- WE ARE PLANNING TO

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:10.513
ADD A THIRD PROGRAM ALONG

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.015
PARTICIPATION PROGRAM FOR WHICH

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.917
WE ARE CURRENTLY IN TALKS WITH

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.919
POTENTIAL FINANCIAL PARTNERS

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:20.089
FOUR PROGRAM IDEAS AND PROPOSALS

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:23.559
WE ARE HOPING TO IMPLEMENT

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.561
THE LAW PARTICIPATION PROGRAM

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.730
WITHIN THE FIRST CHARGE OF THE

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.532
TEN YEAR PROGRAM AND THAT'S

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:31.067
WITHIN THE FIRST THREE YEARS

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.069
THE PROGRAM GUIDANCE IS PRETTY

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.870
CLEAR TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WE

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:36.906
JUST WILL AMEND OUR APPLICATION

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.140
TO REFLECT THE THIRD PER

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:40.209
GROUP PROGRAM AND ASKED TO

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.677
ADJUST THE ALLOCATION TO THE

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:44.180
OTHER PROGRAMS AND REALLOCATE

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:46.916
FUNDING TO THE NEW PROGRAM AND

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:49.252
WE PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.787
SELECT -- AN APPROACH THAT

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:54.223
WILL ALLOW US TO DEPLOY LARGE

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.158
AMOUNTS OF NINETY TWO ASSISTS

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.094
CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:02.131
ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE HOPING

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.533
TO DO -- IN ENGAGING OUR LENDER

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.536
COMMUNITY REGARDING SS DCI ONE

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.839
POINT -- WE LEARNED THAT A LOT

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:12.108
OF OUR LENDERS WERE NOT A FAN

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:14.110
OF THE RECAPTURE FEATURE FOR

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:16.879
THE -- CAPITAL -- ACCESS PROGRAM

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.615
SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM THIS TIME

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.550
WE HAVE SUSPENDED THE RECAPTURE

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:24.086
FEATURE FOR THIS PROGRAM --

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.388
LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU A LITTLE

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.256
BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT FEATURE

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:29.725
DOES THE RECAPTURE FOR CAPITAL

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.560
ACCESS PROGRAM SMALL BUSINESS

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:33.195
WAS INTRODUCED TO SUSTAIN

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.930
THE PROGRAM WHEN THE FEDERAL

01:05:34.997 --> 01:05:37.266
FUNDING INDEED SINCE THE LOAN

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.534
LOSS RESERVE ACCOUNT IS THE

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.870
POOL FOR ALL OUTSTANDING LOANS

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.705
THERE IS A CALCULATION DONE

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.640
ANNUALLY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.409
OUTSTANDING LOANS AND RESERVE

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.377
BALANCE WITH THE BASELINE

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.112
RESERVE LEVEL TO DETERMINE

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:51.580
THE AMOUNT OF RECAPTURE

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:54.984
SO THIS TIME WE HAVE SUSPENDED

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.253
THAT ALLOWING US TO --

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:00.356
DEPLOYMENT GREATER AMOUNT OF

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:02.391
FUNDS -- ALSO ANOTHER THING

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.360
THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO -- AS

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.095
WE MAKE EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:08.164
NETWORK ANOTHER NEW FEATURES

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:10.299
THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED IT --

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.168
IN THE PROGRAM IS THAT WE WILL

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.737
MATCH THE BORROWER'S FEE OF

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.439
UP TO THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.808
AND THE LENDERS CONTRIBUTION

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.142
OF UP TO THREE POINT FIVE

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:22.511
PERCENT WE WILL MATCH THOSE

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:25.581
CONTRIBUTIONS COMBINED WITH

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.882
THE CONTRIBUTION A PROGRAM

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:29.318
CONTRIBUTION UP TO SEVEN PERCENT

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.887
SO THIS TIME WE WILL BE

01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:34.523
CONTRIBUTING A LARGER AMOUNT OF

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:37.259
MONEY LENDERS IN OUR PROGRAM

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:39.595
THAT WE'VE SPOKEN WITH ARE

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.564
EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW FEATURE

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:49.672
I'M SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:52.007
CPA CFA AND I'VE BEEN PROGRAMS

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.443
WHILE BOTH PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.978
TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.147
THE CP CFA PROGRAM LENDERS

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:00.416
LOAN ON AVERAGE IS A SMALLER

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:02.118
DOLLAR AMOUNT AND THEREFORE

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.620
-- IT REACHES A LOT OF LOW TO

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.489
MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.792
-- CP CFA CAL CAP HISTORICALLY

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.260
REACHES MORE CREDIT CHALLENGE

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:12.561
AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:15.331
COMMUNITIES AND -- THE I.

NINE BILLION DOLLARS THESE ARE

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.561
OUR NETWORK PARTNERS I HERE'S

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.062

AT DEFAULT RATES HERE'S OUR

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:34.102

THERE IS A STRATEGIC PLAN

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:49.017
THAT IS INCORPORATED INTO

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:50.885
OUR JOINT APPLICATION TO U.

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:52.520
S. TREASURY THAT WAS SUBMITTED

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:56.925

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.993
SUMMARY OF THAT OVERALL PLAN I

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.196
THINK IT'S ABOUT A SIX OR SEVEN

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:03.598
SUMMARY IT PROVIDED IN LATE

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:05.467

WE'VE GOT IT SAID THIS IS THE

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:12.607
CALIFORNIA SAYS PCI SUMMARY

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:14.476
JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO OKAY

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:15.910
WHICH I THINK IS GOOD IT'S A

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:18.046
GOOD START I THINK I'M IN A

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:19.247
FROM MY VIEW I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:21.616
REALLY HELPFUL FOR THAT THE

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:22.517
LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE BUT

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.219
CERTAINLY I THINK FOR THE AT

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.721
THESE COMMITTEES TO HAVE A

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.523
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AROUND

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.859
-- THAT THE METRICS AND GOALS

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:33.428
BOTH FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:35.763
BUT ALSO FOR AT UNDERSTANDING

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:36.965
THE DEFINITION OF PROGRAM

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:39.167
SUCCESS I'M SO YOU KNOW THAT

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:40.201
CERTAINLY WOULD BE A REQUEST

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:41.536
THAT I HAVE IS WE COME AWAY

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:42.871
FROM THIS AND I THINK THAT THAT

01:25:43.104 --> 01:25:45.306
WILL ENABLE ALL OF US TO BE

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:46.908
ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:49.577

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:52.747

THE LEAD ON THAT SORT OF A

01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:06.027

US TREASURY AND FROM THE AYE

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:49.470

WITH SUMMARY FOR YOU OKAY GREAT

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:55.176
AND AND THEN JUST SPECIFICALLY

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:57.912
I'M AT THE THE L. A. -- I

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:59.480
THOUGHT YOU YOU MADE AN ENGINEER

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.449
YOUR OPENING OBSERVATION THAT IN

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:03.351
SOME RESPECT THE U. S. TREASURY

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.786
TREASURY REQUIREMENTS I THINK

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.554
YOU SAID WORK AT CROSS PURPOSES

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:08.523
I'M I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:10.124
IN THE PANELIST OTHER PANELISTS

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:12.527
REACTIONS TO THAT ASSESSMENT

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:14.996
AND THEN ALSO JUST SPECIFICALLY

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:18.533
AT AROUND AT THE POINT

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:21.169
THAT AS WE EXPAND THIS PROGRAM

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.770
WILL NEED TO CONSIDER ISHAAN

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.872
TOLERANCE FOR RISK SPECIFICALLY

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:27.542
WHAT ARE AT OUR CURRENT

01:27:27.609 --> 01:27:28.810
DEFAULT RATES AND WHAT ARE

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.178
THE ASSUMPTIONS AS WE LOOK

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:32.246
FORWARD AND EXPAND THE PROGRAM

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.819
-- I KNOW FOR THE CAPITAL

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:40.688
ACCESS PROGRAM THAT

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:43.057
IS A LOAN LOSS RESERVE

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:46.494
PORTFOLIO -- PROGRAM --

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:48.896
THAT PROGRAM THE BUSINESS IS

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:51.366
LOS THAT'S WHAT WE DO

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:54.636
WE INCENTIVIZE LENDING

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:57.972
-- TO FOLKS WHO OTHERWISE

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:01.109
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:04.012
OBTAIN LOANS -- AND MAY

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:05.413
END UP IN THE HANDS OF

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.182
PREDATORY LENDERS -- WE CAN

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:11.219
INCENTIVIZE THE BANK TO MAKE

01:28:11.285 --> 01:28:13.154
THAT LOAN AND WE CAN COVER IT

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:16.124
SO THE DEFAULT RATE IS NOT

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:17.859
SOMETHING THAT WE CONCENTRATE

01:28:17.925 --> 01:28:19.293
ON THAT'S NOT A PERFORMANCE

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.295
INDICATOR FOR THAT PROGRAM

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:23.731
-- FOR THAT PROGRAM THE

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:25.333
SEVENTY PERCENT OF BUSINESSES

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.301
THAT ARE ABLE TO THRIVE

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:30.038
AND MAKE IT AND CONTINUE ON

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:32.540
-- THAT'S OUR PERFORMANCE

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:35.276
INDICATOR FOR SUCH A PROGRAM

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.512
OUR COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:39.881
HAS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:41.949
OF A DEFAULT RATE SO WE DON'T

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.785
REALLY TRACK THAT EITHER AS

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.120
A PERFORMANCE INDICATOR TOM

FOR ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.531
HELP DICTATE HOW SUSTAINABLE

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:32.400
THE PROGRAM IS LONG TERM IF IT

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:43.811
APPROXIMATELY ONE PERCENT AND

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:45.580
THAT'S ENABLED IT TO REMAIN

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:47.415
SUSTAINABLE AND GROW WITH ITS

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:48.649

SERVED AT EIGHTY TWO TO ONE

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:24.519
LEVEL AND SO IT COULD ABSORB

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.053
VERY HIGH LOSSES HAVING

BE IN THERE SO WE WOULD KNOW

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:18.586

THE LOAN DEFAULT RATE --

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:14.361
JUST MERELY PUT IT IN ON

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:16.263

THE DEFAULT RATE WE HAVE

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:42.956
A TOOL THAT WAS MENTIONED

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:45.158

NATIONALLY CAN REDUCE --

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:54.000

OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY I

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:08.582
THINK IT IS EASY FOR US TO LOOK

01:48:08.648 --> 01:48:11.218
AT OUR DEFAULT RATE AND ASSESS

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:12.853
THE RISKS WE WANT TO TAKE IN

01:48:12.919 --> 01:48:14.087
GETTING EIGHTY PERCENT OF THIS

COMPANY OUT IN THE FIRST TRASH

01:48:16.089 --> 01:48:17.290
I THINK THAT IT'S CRITICAL

01:48:17.357 --> 01:48:19.392
THAT WE LOOK AT THAT THE STATE

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:22.062

EFFECTIVELY AND MAKE IT -- AND

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:32.772
QUICKLY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:34.140
DEALING WITH THE RECOVERY OF THE

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:36.843
CULVERT -- THE WE

01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:38.511
HAVE TO HAVE THE PROPER STAFFING

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:39.813
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PROPER

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.282
STREAMLINING WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:44.851
AT HOW WE ARE DOING

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:46.887
THAT REFERRAL YOU KNOW THE --

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:49.623
THE REPRESENTATIVE LACY WAS

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:51.424
MENTIONING THE RULE AREAS

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:54.828
WE HAVE TOO MANY DIFFERENT

01:48:54.895 --> 01:48:57.430
WAYS THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING

01:48:57.497 --> 01:48:59.532
OUR PLAN WE NEED TO STRUCTURE

01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:01.568
THAT IN A WAY THAT IS

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:04.537
VERY ZERO DAN TWO

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:07.340
ONE STOP CAPITAL KIND

01:49:07.407 --> 01:49:09.809
OF SHOP FOR PEOPLE TO ENTRY

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:11.344
AND AND I THINK WE HAVE THAT

01:49:11.411 --> 01:49:12.712
IN SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

01:49:12.779 --> 01:49:13.947
CENTER SO I THINK WE NEED TO

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:15.982
LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT HOW WE

01:49:16.049 --> 01:49:18.518
ALIGN THAT THE LAST THING I

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:20.420
WOULD SAY -- BEFORE PASSING ON

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:22.555
TO MY OTHER PANELISTS WE HAVE

01:49:22.622 --> 01:49:24.357
A LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:26.826
AND THE COST OF CAPITAL WE CAN'T

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:30.096
PASS THIS ON TO THE SMALL

01:49:30.163 --> 01:49:31.765
BUSINESSES AND ROLLED IN THESE

01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:33.867
DEPARTMENTS THAT IN THESE CREDIT

01:49:33.934 --> 01:49:35.735
ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS WE SHOULD

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:38.071
LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO MINIMIZE

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:40.307
THE COST OF CAPITAL WHEN

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:42.442
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LOANS --

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:45.045
WHEN WE LOOK AT BUSINESSES THAT

01:49:45.111 --> 01:49:47.747
ARE LESS THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:49.616
-- YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:49:49.983 --> 01:49:53.019
BUSINESSES THAT ARE REALLY USING

01:49:53.086 --> 01:49:55.622
EVERY SCRAP OF CAPITAL THEY HAVE

01:49:56.089 --> 01:49:59.659
SO WE KNOW THAT MICROLOANS

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.028
FIFTY THOUSAND OR LESS ARE

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.163
AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:05.598
THEY'RE BUT THE BAD LOAN PROBLEM

01:50:05.665 --> 01:50:08.101
AND LACK OF SERVICES BETWEEN

01:50:08.168 --> 01:50:09.970
THE FIFTY THOUSAND AND A TWO

01:50:10.036 --> 01:50:11.104
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:13.606
LEVEL THAT IS TOO EXPENSIVE

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:15.275
FOR OUR TYPICAL COMMERCIAL

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:16.876
BANKS TO MAKE THAT LOAN WITH

01:50:16.943 --> 01:50:19.012
THEIR HIGH PRICE LOAN OFFICERS

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:21.481
AN UNDERWRITING PROCESS HOW

01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:23.049
DO WE SUPPLEMENT THAT AND HOW

01:50:23.116 --> 01:50:25.051
DO WE USE THAT TO KEEP THE COST

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:26.853
OF CAPITAL DOWN IS CRUCIAL IN

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.655
THIS PROGRAM IF WE ARE GOING

01:50:28.722 --> 01:50:30.056
TO GO INTO THAT COMMUNITY

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:34.361
SEVERAL I WOULD ANSWER THE

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:36.629
QUESTION FOLLOWING A LOT -- WHAT

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:38.498
MY FELLOW PANELISTS JUST MENTION

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:40.967
-- THERE IS DEFINITELY A BIG --

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:43.303
A ROBUST ECOSYSTEM OF SUPPORTING

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:45.605
CALIFORNIA AND I HAD THE STATE

01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:47.774
NEEDS TO LEVERAGE THAT TO REALLY

01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:48.708
REACH THE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:50.210

DIRECTLY TO REALLY REACH THIS

01:50:58.752 --> 01:51:00.520
COMMUNITIES AND DEPLOY CAPITAL

01:51:00.887 --> 01:51:02.288
AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR

01:51:02.355 --> 01:51:04.424
US TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE RISK

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:05.625
THAT THE STATE IS WILLING TO

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:07.460
TAKE TO REALLY REACH STATE THAT

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:08.628

TO INCREASE THAT THE FULL RATE

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.837
ARE WE WILLING TO CONSIDER

01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:19.272
ALTERNATIVE UNDERWRITING

01:51:19.339 --> 01:51:20.874
CRITERIA THAT WOULD ALLOW US

01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:22.942
TO ASSESS THE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:51:23.009 --> 01:51:24.844
IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY APPLIES

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:27.414
TO THEIR CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:29.349
-- SO IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:31.051
OFFERED TO STAY TO REAL LEVERAGE

01:51:31.117 --> 01:51:32.652

THAT THE OUTRAGE IS GONNA BEAT

01:51:40.193 --> 01:51:42.128
DELIVERED SO HOW COULD WE REACH

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:43.930
HOW COULD THE STATE REALLY BUILD

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:46.366
INTO THE ECOSYSTEM AND THE

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:48.968

SAY THAT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:51:58.578 --> 01:52:00.780
RESOURCE PARTNERS NEED TO BUILD

01:52:00.847 --> 01:52:02.482
THEIR OWN CAPACITY TO DEPLOY

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:04.551

EVERYTHING HAS TO COME WITH

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:11.624
OUR STRATEGY TO BUILD THAT

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:13.693
CAPACITY IT COULD BE THROUGH

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.829
OBVIOUSLY I'LL REACH FUNDING

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:17.430

REMEMBER IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:35.081

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:44.357
WORK AND HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:46.159
IT'S NOT TRUST THAT REALLY

BUILDING ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:56.536
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL WE HAVE

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:58.171
AN ACCELERATOR AND INVESTMENT

01:52:58.238 --> 01:52:59.239
PRACTICE USING CONVERTIBLE

01:52:59.305 --> 01:53:01.040
NOTES AND EQUITY INTO BUSINESSES

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:02.609
RIGHT INTO THE AREA THAT YOU'RE

01:53:02.675 --> 01:53:04.911
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT FIFTY TO TWO

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:05.979
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:53:06.045 --> 01:53:07.313

POPULATION OF COLORADO IN TWO

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:48.681
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH IS THE

01:54:48.748 --> 01:54:50.984
MOST RECENT DATA I COULD FIND

01:54:51.217 --> 01:54:53.219
COLORADO'S CASH COLLATERAL

HOW CAPS CASH COLLATERAL

01:55:22.448 --> 01:55:24.717
-- RESERVE PROGRAM ALSO

01:55:25.151 --> 01:55:26.619
WOULD DO WELL TO INCREASED

01:55:26.886 --> 01:55:28.054
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

01:55:28.121 --> 01:55:30.189
STAFFING AND CENTRALIZATION

01:55:30.256 --> 01:55:32.225

IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:54.314
SO COLORADO'S OUTREACH

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:56.249
IS IN LARGE PART DUE TO

01:55:56.316 --> 01:55:58.584
CENTRALISATION AND THE CAPACITY

IN TERMS OF WHY THEY ARE BEING

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:17.437
RELATIVELY MORE EFFECTIVE HAS

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:18.971
TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR

01:56:21.074 --> 01:56:24.277
YES IS CENTRALIZE IS SUPPORTED

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:26.746
BY THE STAFFING THAT IS REQUIRED

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:28.848
SEEK TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A

PROGRAM AND ITS OUT REACH

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:35.488
COLORADO DOES NOT ENGAGE

01:56:35.555 --> 01:56:37.523
IN SO MANY AS A CALIFORNIA

01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:39.192
AND A DIVERSITY OF TECHNICAL

01:56:39.258 --> 01:56:41.527

01:56:41.594 --> 01:56:43.196
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:45.198
IN ONE AREA THAT REACHES OUT

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:46.799
TO THE TO THE COMMUNITY AND

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:48.368
THAT IS IN THE RULES AND IN THE

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:51.371
MINORITY AND LOW AND MODERATE

01:56:51.437 --> 01:56:53.873
INCOME AREAS AND I THINK AND

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:54.874
THEN WE HAD AND MADE THIS

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:56.142

SO MANY RESOURCES AVAILABLE

OUR STAFFS TO NAVIGATE THAT

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:09.422
AND I THINK THE POINT YOU'RE

01:57:09.489 --> 01:57:11.724
MAKING IS BY SIMPLIFYING THAT

01:57:12.525 --> 01:57:14.127
BY STREAMLINING SOME OF THAT WE

01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:16.396

SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY NEEDS

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:19.999
ONE PLACE TO GO GET IN ANY ONE

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:22.435
PLACE TO START WE HAVE SET THEM

01:57:22.502 --> 01:57:24.437
UP WHERE THEY ARE DIVIDED IS

01:57:24.504 --> 01:57:25.838
TOO DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:27.173
ARE AND WHO THEY'RE TALKING TO

01:57:27.974 --> 01:57:29.475
WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND THAT IS

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:31.878
THE FIRST CONFUSION AND WHEN

01:57:31.944 --> 01:57:33.713
YOU ARE AND WHEN ENGLISH IS NOT

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:35.448
YOUR SECOND LANGUAGE AND WHEN

YOU ARE IN COMMUNITIES RURAL

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:39.218
COMMUNITIES LIKE HE WAS SPEAKING

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:40.553
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMMUNITY

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:42.054
BASED THAT THEY CAN GO TO ONE

01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:44.123
PLACE AND COME COLLECT THAT DATA

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:45.491
IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT AT THE

01:57:45.558 --> 01:57:47.727

BEEN IN THE AUDIENCE AND SEEN

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:04.210
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING CALL AND

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:05.912
CALIFORNIA AND IN COMPARISON

01:58:05.978 --> 01:58:08.281
TO THE COLORADO WHAT CAN

YOU SUGGEST ARE THINGS THAT HAVE

01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:11.651
BEEN WORKING AND NOT WORKING

01:58:11.717 --> 01:58:13.886
BASED ON BEING -- WORK THAT

01:58:13.953 --> 01:58:15.488
YOU DO AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:17.757
THAT CAN BE MADE IN ROUND TWO

01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:22.628
WELL I WOULD -- HI TECH HERE

01:58:22.695 --> 01:58:25.832
-- I THINK THE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:58:26.065 --> 01:58:27.900
AS WE ALL KNOW HALF A SUMMIT

01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:29.936
UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES RIGHT

01:58:30.269 --> 01:58:31.504
READ EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:32.872
DONE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:34.407
YEARS HAS GIVING AS A LOT OF

01:58:34.474 --> 01:58:36.843
LEARNING LESSONS LEARNT SO WE

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:38.444
SHOULD DEFINITELY LEARN FROM

01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:40.947
THEM AND DO THE STARTED --

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.849
BUILDING UPON THAT AS WE'RE

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:44.784
PUTTING TOGETHER DO YOU THE

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:46.919
NEW PROGRAMS STILL SOME OF

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.054
THE LESSONS WE LEARNED DURING

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.922
THE PANDEMIC RELIEF EFFORTS I

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:51.290
WOULD SAY IS FIRST CALIFORNIA

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:52.525
HAS A VERY STRONG AND OPEN

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:55.061
REALITY CONSISTENT -- SO WE

01:58:55.127 --> 01:58:56.863
SHOULD BE LEVERAGING THAT TO

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:58.798
REACH COMMUNITIES AND DEPLOYED

01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:00.433
AND EDUCATE ABOUT THE PROGRAMS

01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:03.035
AVAILABLE -- THEY UNDERSERVED

01:59:03.102 --> 01:59:04.237
AS SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:06.839
NEED MORE TIME AND ALL RIGHT

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:08.541
TOUCH POINTS TO BUILD TRUSTS

01:59:08.841 --> 01:59:11.110
STILL GOING TO WHAT -- ALSO

01:59:11.177 --> 01:59:12.778
WAS MENTIONING BEFORE IS WE

01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:14.213
NEED TO BILL TRIES TO REACH

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:16.282
REALLY BEING ABLE TO ADVISE

01:59:16.349 --> 01:59:17.383
THEM INTO WHAT PRODUCTS THEY

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:18.851
SHOULD PICK SO THAT IS SOMETHING

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:21.220
THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD

01:59:21.654 --> 01:59:23.122
AND THE THIRD IS OUT LANGUAGE

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:24.223
AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:26.259
RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO REACH

01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:27.960
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:29.128
WE'VE BEEN MENTIONING A COUPLE

01:59:29.195 --> 01:59:31.564
TIMES DURING THE PREVIOUS PANEL

01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:33.432
AND DURING THIS PRESENTATION

01:59:33.699 --> 01:59:35.601
IS THE LANGUAGE BARRIERS

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:37.003
AND DIGITAL DIVIDE ARE AT

01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:38.604
PEAK CHALLENGE FOR THE SMALL

01:59:38.671 --> 01:59:40.873
BUSINESSES SO UNDERSTANDING

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:42.708
THAT IS A CHALLENGE AND REALLY

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:44.677
ARE INCLUDING IN THE STRATEGY

01:59:44.744 --> 01:59:46.412
TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM IS

01:59:46.479 --> 01:59:48.514
GOING TO BE VITAL T. -- BUILD

01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:50.950
THAT THIS SUCCESS AND FOURTH

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:52.251
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE

01:59:52.318 --> 01:59:53.653
CRUCIAL FROM AS SPREADING THE

01:59:53.719 --> 01:59:56.656
INFORMATION -- THE SAME BECAUSE

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:58.491
THE DIGITAL LITERACY IS A

01:59:58.558 --> 02:00:00.493
TALENT WE NEED TO REALLY MAKES

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:01.928
THE WAY THAT WE ARE DOING OUR

02:00:01.994 --> 02:00:03.763
EACH IS TRADITIONAL AVERAGE

02:00:03.829 --> 02:00:05.131
BUT HE'S ALSO REALLY BUILDING

02:00:05.197 --> 02:00:07.033
AND LEVERAGING THEY ARE RICHARD

02:00:07.099 --> 02:00:08.367
AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

02:00:08.434 --> 02:00:10.002
THAT ARE ABLE TO FIND A SMALL

02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:11.070
BUSINESSES WHERE THEY ARE

02:00:13.539 --> 02:00:15.241
THIS IS A LITTLE TRICKY RIGHT

02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:18.210
BECAUSE -- WE ARE DEALING

02:00:18.277 --> 02:00:20.680
WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION

02:00:20.746 --> 02:00:22.248
RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE THIS

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:23.916
ENORMOUS INFUSION OF CAPITAL

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:26.419
COMING INTO THE STATE CALIFORNIA

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:28.521
IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE

02:00:28.588 --> 02:00:30.756
FORWARD THINKING LEADERS AS

02:00:30.823 --> 02:00:32.425
STATE LEADERS IN OUR COUNTRY

02:00:32.792 --> 02:00:34.160
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

02:00:34.226 --> 02:00:35.461
SOMETHING REALLY DIFFERENT

02:00:35.528 --> 02:00:37.396
HERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:00:37.463 --> 02:00:38.664
TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT HOW WE'RE

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:40.633
DEPLOYING CAPITAL AND USING

02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:42.435
THE TOOLS AND THE RESOURCES

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:45.071
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO MAKE

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:48.307
-- CAPITAL PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT

02:00:48.374 --> 02:00:50.142
PROGRAMS OPERATE IN A DIFFERENT

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:51.243
KIND OF WAY THAN THEY HAVE IN

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:53.145
THE PAST MY BIGGEST CONCERN

02:00:53.212 --> 02:00:54.213
IS WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.748
MOVE MONEY IN THE PAST IN THE

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:57.216
CHANNELS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:59.118
AND EXPECT A DIFFERENT RESULT

02:00:59.552 --> 02:01:01.420
-- CDFI IS I'VE BEEN IN THIS

02:01:01.487 --> 02:01:02.922
INDUSTRY FIFTEEN YEARS I LOVE

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:05.157
THIS INDUSTRY THE RACIAL AND

02:01:05.224 --> 02:01:06.959
GENDER WEALTH GAPS HAVE GROWN

02:01:07.026 --> 02:01:08.294
SAID SEE IF I'D HAVE BEEN DOING

02:01:08.361 --> 02:01:10.262
THIS WORK THE IMPACT IS REALLY

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:12.298
GOOD THE OUTCOME IS NOT WHAT WE

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:13.733
WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA HAS AN

02:01:13.799 --> 02:01:16.168
OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO START

02:01:16.235 --> 02:01:17.536
WORKING TOWARDS A VERY DIFFERENT

02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:19.338
OUTCOME AND LOOKING AT HOW WE

02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:20.773
SOLVE THIS COMPLEX PUZZLE AND

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.875
IT IN ANY WAY AND IT'S LEADERS

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.377
LIKE THAT MY CO PANELISTS HERE

02:01:24.443 --> 02:01:25.511
AND THE ONES BEFORE US THAT I

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:27.179
THINK CAN WORK TOGETHER TO COME

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:28.748
UP WITH SOME THANK YOU MISS

02:01:28.814 --> 02:01:31.250
KELLY IF IF I CAN FOLLOW UP

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:33.052
ON ON SOMETHING THAT WAS --

02:01:33.919 --> 02:01:35.554
YOU ACTUALLY SHARED EARLIER

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:37.189
YOU KNOW BASED ON THE CURRENT

02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:38.858
AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING BETWEEN

02:01:38.924 --> 02:01:41.260
THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS

02:01:41.327 --> 02:01:43.062
WHAT SHOULD BE THE DESIRED

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:45.731
BALANCE BETWEEN FUNDING SMALL

02:01:45.798 --> 02:01:47.533
BUSINESS START UPS BUSINESS

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.502
EXPANSION CERTAIN INDUSTRY

02:01:49.568 --> 02:01:51.570
SECTORS MICRO BUSINESSES

02:01:51.837 --> 02:01:52.838
WHAT ARE YOUR INSIGHTS

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:56.075
MY MAGIC BUT NOT

02:01:57.209 --> 02:01:59.078
YOU KNOW I THINK --

02:01:59.712 --> 02:02:01.380
THE BALANCE NEEDS TO REFLECT THE

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:02.948
COMMUNITIES THAT WERE SERVING

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:06.819
PERIOD AND SO WE HAVE --

02:02:06.886 --> 02:02:08.254
WOMEN OF COLOR SPECIFICALLY

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.889
BLACK WOMEN START BUSINESSES

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:11.257
THAT THE HIGHER IS HIGHEST RATE

02:02:11.323 --> 02:02:13.092
OF ANY OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC IN OUR

02:02:13.159 --> 02:02:15.027
IN OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:17.797
I'M THEY'RE NOT ACCESSING THAT

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:19.432
WHERE ARE THEY ACCESSING THAT

02:02:19.498 --> 02:02:20.533
WILL BE DEBT PROGRAMS WEREN'T

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:22.668
BUILT FOR HER RIGHT THE THE

02:02:22.735 --> 02:02:24.837
THE CREDIT CRITERIA THAT CREDIT

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:26.405
SCORES IN THE ASSET RATIOS

02:02:26.472 --> 02:02:27.473
AND ALL OF THESE COLLATERAL

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:29.909
REQUIREMENTS DON'T GIVE HER ANY

02:02:29.975 --> 02:02:31.544
TRUST ACTUALLY IN THE SYSTEM

02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:32.578
THAT IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT HER

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:33.646
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THINKING

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:35.548
ABOUT HOW WE CAN ALLOCATE THESE

02:02:35.614 --> 02:02:37.850
FUNDS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:39.919
THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT ARE THE

02:02:39.985 --> 02:02:41.620
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN FOSTER

02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:44.223
FLEXIBILITY -- WHAT ARE THE

02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:46.025
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN FOSTER

02:02:46.358 --> 02:02:48.561
-- ENTREPRENEURS TO HAVE TRUST

02:02:48.627 --> 02:02:50.596
IN CONTINUE TO TRUST THAT THE

02:02:50.996 --> 02:02:52.031
PARTNERS THAT THEY'RE WORKING

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:53.699
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BUT THEN

02:02:53.766 --> 02:02:55.000
ALSO THOSE PARTNERS HAVE THE

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:56.602
TRUST FROM THE STATE AND THE

02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:58.237
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE ARE

02:02:58.304 --> 02:02:59.672
GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND HOW

02:02:59.739 --> 02:03:01.540
WE DEPLOY THESE CAPITALS BECAUSE

02:03:01.607 --> 02:03:03.809
LOOK IF WE FAIL WE'RE THE ONES

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:05.511
HAVING TO LOOK AT THESE PEOPLE

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:07.246
OUR COMMUNITY IN THE EYE AND

02:03:07.313 --> 02:03:09.315
SAY SORRY WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:11.050
FOR YOU SO WHEN I THINK WHEN WE

02:03:11.117 --> 02:03:12.485
THINK ABOUT THIS DISTRIBUTION

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:14.720
YES I CAN GIVE YOU DATA ON YOU

02:03:14.787 --> 02:03:16.555
KNOW THE ACT EXACT DISTRIBUTION

02:03:16.622 --> 02:03:18.591
BETWEEN BUSINESS SIZE SECTOR

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.960
AT CETERA BUT REALLY I THINK

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:22.394
WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

02:03:22.461 --> 02:03:24.230
IS HOW DO WE CREATE FLEXIBILITY

02:03:24.463 --> 02:03:26.665
AND INCENTIVIZE FLEXIBILITY AND

02:03:26.732 --> 02:03:28.768
HOW WE DISTRIBUTE THIS MONEY FOR

02:03:30.002 --> 02:03:31.604
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THAT

02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:33.439
I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO AT THE

02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:36.442
BEGINNING IS WE CAN LOOK

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:37.777
AT THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR

02:03:37.843 --> 02:03:40.012
BUSINESSES ARE THEY START UPS

02:03:40.346 --> 02:03:42.248
ARE HAVE THEY BEEN IN BUSINESS

02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:43.883
FOR THREE OR MORE YEARS DO THEY

02:03:43.949 --> 02:03:46.452
EMPLOY A FIVE OR MORE PEOPLE

02:03:46.685 --> 02:03:48.420
ARE THEY AT THE POINT OF A

02:03:48.487 --> 02:03:51.624
REPORTER EXPORTING OUT WE KNOW

02:03:51.891 --> 02:03:54.059
THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT SMALL

02:03:54.126 --> 02:03:56.395
BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:58.931
HAVE FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES ARE LESS

02:03:59.298 --> 02:04:01.300
THEY CREATED TWO THIRDS OF ALL

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:03.235
THE NET JOBS SINCE THE GREAT

02:04:03.302 --> 02:04:04.870
RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND NINE

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:06.939
WE ALSO KNOW THAT FORTY PERCENT

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.874
OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND OF THAT

02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:10.709
FORTY PERCENT SEVENTY PERCENT OF

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:12.211
THEM WERE WOMEN OF COLOR GETTING

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:13.646
TO HER POINT IN WHAT SHE'S

02:04:13.712 --> 02:04:15.781
SAYING HERE IF WE CAN MEET THEM

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.950
WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR BUSINESS

02:04:18.017 --> 02:04:19.985
AND HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY WE

02:04:20.052 --> 02:04:22.254
WILL KNOW BASED ON USE OF FUNDS

02:04:22.321 --> 02:04:24.423
WHAT KIND OF LOANS TO DO THAT

02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:26.725
AND I THINK WE HAVE

02:04:26.792 --> 02:04:28.527
AN ADVANTAGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:04:28.894 --> 02:04:30.663
BECAUSE I BANK HAS THE

02:04:30.729 --> 02:04:32.832
FACILITIES TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT

02:04:32.898 --> 02:04:35.067
THAT KIND OF THING IT WOULD

02:04:35.134 --> 02:04:37.369
DECIDE QUICKLY -- I COMPLETELY

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:39.371
AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF I HAVE

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:42.074
FLEXIBLE -- FLEXIBILITY IN THE

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:43.843
PRODUCTS AND JUST TO KEEP IN

02:04:43.909 --> 02:04:45.678
MIND WHEN THE COBBETT ONE COPY

02:04:45.744 --> 02:04:46.846

02:04:46.912 --> 02:04:48.480
PROGRAMS GAME FOR EXISTING

BUSINESS TO KEEP THEM AND IN IN

02:04:50.716 --> 02:04:52.184
OPERATIONS WHICH OBVIOUSLY WAS

02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:53.919
THE NATURAL NATURAL THING T.

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:57.056
DO BUT AS WE WERE LOOKING AND

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:59.458
WE ACTUALLY I STARTED SEEING

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:00.593
A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS TO START

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:01.861

MANY PRODUCTS FOR THEM AND

02:05:06.165 --> 02:05:07.566
IT WAS COMPLETELY REASONABLE

02:05:07.633 --> 02:05:09.001
TO HAVE TO START UPS RIGHT IT

02:05:09.068 --> 02:05:10.202
WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WAS

02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:12.404
BEING LAID OFF THAT THEY WERE

02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:14.807
ACTUALLY TRYING TO RETHINK WHAT

02:05:14.874 --> 02:05:16.709
THEY WANTED TO DO RIGHT SO I

02:05:16.775 --> 02:05:18.377

ACTUALLY HAD IN OVER A THOUSAND

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:21.981
PERCENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER

PERCENT INCREASE AND OUR

02:05:27.419 --> 02:05:29.188
MEMBERS DIDN'T HAVE THE PRODUCT

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:30.522
AVAILABLE FOR TO START UPS AT

02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:32.858

YOU HAVE TO MEET THE BUSINESS

02:06:57.376 --> 02:06:59.211
WHERE THEY ARE AND IT IS VERY

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:01.680
DIFFICULT TO HAVE ALL OF COOKIE

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.716
CUTTER PREDICTIONS BECAUSE

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:05.351
ENTREPRENEURS COME FROM ALL

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:06.685
KINDS OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES

02:07:06.752 --> 02:07:08.754
IN ALL TYPES OF TYPES OF DID

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:11.023
BUSINESS START UPS SO YOU YOU

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:13.258
WOULD HAVE TO IN THIS IS WHY

02:07:13.325 --> 02:07:15.861
IT IS KEY TO HAVE COUNSELING

02:07:15.928 --> 02:07:17.363
AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NOT

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:19.732
JUST TRAINING BUT COUNSELING

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:22.501
TO GET TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:24.603
ENTREPRENEUR GET UNDERSTAND

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:27.239
HIM OR HER AND IN THE PROCESS

02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:28.240
AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:31.310
SELL A AND HOW I WILL

02:07:31.577 --> 02:07:33.979
HANDLE OR COUNCIL AND RESTAURANT

02:07:34.046 --> 02:07:35.614
WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:37.683
THAN FINANCIAL SERVICES OR

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:39.818
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND

02:07:39.885 --> 02:07:41.920
HOW I WOULD COUNSEL SOMEONE

02:07:41.987 --> 02:07:43.288
THAT HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:44.990
FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS VERSUS

02:07:45.057 --> 02:07:47.760
SOMEONE THIS COMING FROM THEIR

02:07:47.826 --> 02:07:49.261
INITIAL THOUGHT AND PATTERNS

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:51.096
TO IMPLEMENTATION TO COVER

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:52.531
COMMERCIALIZATION WOULD BE

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:54.366
TOTALLY DIFFERENT SO IT IT'S

02:07:54.433 --> 02:07:56.902
REALLY HARD FOR ME TO SAY TO

02:07:56.969 --> 02:07:59.304
YOU THAT I WOULD HAVE A WAY

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:00.973
OF APPROACHING HIM BUT WHAT I

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.642
WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IS KEY

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:05.844
TO ALL OF THEM IS THAT THEIR

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:07.780
FIRST THING IS TO UNDERSTAND

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:10.282
THE FINANCIAL -- OBLIGATIONS

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:12.351
THAT THEY HAVE WHAT IS THEIR

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:15.320
COST OF OPERATIONS WHAT IS THEIR

02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:17.122
PROFITABILITY WHAT IS THEIR

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:19.425
REAL PAID REPAYMENT ABILITY

02:08:19.625 --> 02:08:20.959
WHEN THEY LOOK AT DEBT AND

02:08:21.026 --> 02:08:23.362
AND IF IS IS THAT REALLY WHAT

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:25.330
THEY NEED TO GO FOUR VERSES

02:08:25.397 --> 02:08:26.999
IS IT VENTURE CAPITALISTS OR

02:08:27.066 --> 02:08:28.100
IS IT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN

02:08:28.167 --> 02:08:29.435
MAINTAIN THROUGH THEIR OWN

02:08:29.501 --> 02:08:31.537
PROFITS AND CASH FLOW SO YOU

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:33.405
THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE AND NOW

02:08:33.472 --> 02:08:35.941
WITH ANALYZE VERY THOROUGHLY

02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:38.043
INTO THEIR PROCESS AND I I

02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:40.446
THINK THAT IS KEY THAT

02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:43.082
WE DON'T TRY TO SET UP

02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:46.418
A A ONE STOP ONE

02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:48.454
KIND OF PROGRAM THAT

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.323
WOULD -- ALIENATE

02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:53.058
AND AND NOT INCLUDE PEOPLE THAT

02:08:53.125 --> 02:08:54.526
HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR

02:08:54.593 --> 02:08:57.529
OPERATIONS SO FOR THOSE --

02:08:57.596 --> 02:08:59.965
ALREADY -- BUSINESS OF

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.368
BUSINESS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SO

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:07.506
-- TO CONTRIBUTE LARGELY

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:09.641
TO TO -- FINANCIAL --

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:11.643
-- TO STREAMS -- JUST ON A

02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:14.379
COUPLE REVENUE AND

02:09:14.446 --> 02:09:16.682
ON THE OUTSIDE THE RESOURCE IS

02:09:16.748 --> 02:09:19.218
-- THEY HAVE A GIVE UP BY

02:09:19.284 --> 02:09:21.420
AND SO FOR THE FOR THE --

02:09:21.487 --> 02:09:23.755
SO ON TIA'S DAY INITIATE

02:09:24.356 --> 02:09:25.124
THAT THAT THEY WERE NOT

02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:28.127
REVIVED THEIR -- BUSINESS BAD

02:09:28.427 --> 02:09:30.028
AND THEN APPLY FOR IT THOUGH

02:09:30.095 --> 02:09:31.096
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW WHO

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:32.431

I THINK THAT IS A VERY GOOD

02:09:36.835 --> 02:09:38.837
POINT SIR AND I THINK WE

02:09:38.904 --> 02:09:41.173
SHOULD BE MORE PROACTIVE WITH

02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:42.541
THIS EXTRA MONEY THAT WE ARE

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:45.777
GETTING THIS ONE TIME OBLIGATION

02:09:45.844 --> 02:09:47.446

02:12:08.587 --> 02:12:09.821
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS

02:12:09.888 --> 02:12:11.390
OF OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:13.592
PEOPLE AND IF WE EMPLOY THEM TO

02:12:13.659 --> 02:12:16.061
DO THIS IF WE GIVE THEM

02:12:16.128 --> 02:12:18.096
THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY GET

02:12:18.163 --> 02:12:19.898
INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND I HAD

02:12:19.965 --> 02:12:21.633
TO HAVE A FINGER IN THE POLLS

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:23.769
ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES BEFORE

02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:26.138
THEY ARE AT THE POINT OF

02:12:26.204 --> 02:12:28.807
CLOSURE THEN WE ARE HOLDING ON

02:12:28.874 --> 02:12:30.942
TO SUSTAINABILITY THEN WE ARE

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:33.679
MOVING IN AND EXPANDING GROWTH

02:12:33.945 --> 02:12:35.914
AND NOT ONLY CAN WE DO IT AT THE

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:38.583
POINT OF OF NOT LETTING THEM

02:12:38.650 --> 02:12:41.253
DIE BUT ALSO HELPING THEM EXPAND

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.422
OPENING INTO NEW MARKETS OPENING

02:12:43.488 --> 02:12:45.190
INTO THE MIDDLE OPPORTUNITIES

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.625
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:12:46.692 --> 02:12:48.360
ACCESS TO CAPITAL BUT REALLY

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:49.728
WHAT KEEPS A BUSINESS GOING

02:12:49.795 --> 02:12:51.663
IS AT ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY

02:12:52.497 --> 02:12:53.999
SO I THINK WE WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:12:54.066 --> 02:12:56.435
BOTH YEAH I HAVE A COUPLE MORE

02:12:56.501 --> 02:12:58.837
QUESTIONS SO AMONG THE MANY --

02:12:59.905 --> 02:13:02.140
ONE OF THE RESTAURANT OWNER SAID

02:13:02.207 --> 02:13:04.743
THAT I HAD WITH THE KNOWN --

02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:07.713
I CALLED HIM AND HE SAID THE

02:13:07.779 --> 02:13:09.548
I. SHUT DOWN BUT I STARTED

02:13:10.115 --> 02:13:11.516
AS TO A DIFFERENT CITY

02:13:11.917 --> 02:13:13.585
THE REASON WAS THAT THE --

02:13:13.985 --> 02:13:16.321
THEY ARE RENT WENT UP BY A

02:13:16.722 --> 02:13:19.391
-- -- -- PROPORTIONALLY

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:21.593
TOO MUCH AND THAT HE COULDN'T

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:24.563
SUSTAIN SO HE HAS

02:13:24.963 --> 02:13:26.932
TO GO OUT OF FLOOD THAT THE

02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:29.134
PARTICULAR CITY AND THEN LOOK

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:31.803
FOR WHERE HE COULD AFFORD TO

02:13:32.137 --> 02:13:34.272
IN THIS CASE SO HE HAD THE

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:36.608
SOME ASSETS THAT TO CONTINUE

02:13:37.075 --> 02:13:39.911
BUT THE SOME OF THE -- PEOPLE

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:42.848
MAY GIVE UP AND COULDN'T

02:13:42.914 --> 02:13:45.817
HANDLE SO WE HAVE SEEN MANY

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:49.187
RENT CONTROL FOR OUR RESIDENTS

02:13:49.821 --> 02:13:51.523
FOR PROFIT THE HOME IN

02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:53.325
OUR APARTMENT RENTERS SO

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:57.195
BUT I I DON'T THINK

02:13:57.262 --> 02:13:59.598
I REMEMBER WHETHER THERE'S ANY

02:13:59.931 --> 02:14:03.235
RENT CONTROL OR OUR RANGE

02:14:03.668 --> 02:14:05.704
THAT THE ATTENDANCE IT WOULD

02:14:05.771 --> 02:14:07.005
NOT BEST MORE BUSINESS IT

02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:09.441
WOULD NOT BE BONTA WITH THAT

02:14:09.508 --> 02:14:11.576
KIND OF OUTRAGEOUS TO RAISE

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:14.980
IT AS A SENSIBLE AREA FOR

02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:16.715
ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT

02:14:16.782 --> 02:14:18.150
THE WHETHER THERE IS ANY

02:14:19.017 --> 02:14:22.621
REGULATION THAT -- --

02:14:22.988 --> 02:14:24.489
THE ONLY REASON I THINK

02:14:24.556 --> 02:14:26.858
OF WHAT RAN THE AWARD FOR

02:14:26.925 --> 02:14:28.260
MOST OF EXISTING BUSINESS

02:14:28.326 --> 02:14:29.694
WATER BUSINESS SAID DO YOU

02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:30.929
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT

02:14:33.265 --> 02:14:35.100
I DO KNOW THAT AT THE LOCAL

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:37.035
LEVEL MUNICIPALITIES TEND

02:14:37.102 --> 02:14:39.171
TO HAVE -- BUSINESS SUPPORT

02:14:39.371 --> 02:14:41.640
AND TAXES -- CREDIT FOR

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:43.008
SMALL BUSINESSES IN ORDER

02:14:43.074 --> 02:14:45.143
TO SUSTAIN THEIR OPERATIONS

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:47.679
WITHIN THEIR CITY -- I DON'T

02:14:47.746 --> 02:14:49.181
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THAT

02:14:49.247 --> 02:14:50.816
QUIBBLING AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:14:50.882 --> 02:14:52.317
AND I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD BE

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:55.120
INAPPROPRIATE BUT I DO THINK

02:14:55.187 --> 02:14:57.422
THAT LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES HAVE

02:14:57.489 --> 02:15:00.058
THE JURISDICTIONS TO --

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:02.794
IN START UP CASES PUT ON SMALL

02:15:02.861 --> 02:15:05.497
BUSINESSES IN INCUBATORS ORIENT

02:15:05.564 --> 02:15:07.899
IN ACCELERATORS OR IF THEIR

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:10.702
EXISTING BUSINESS TO ALLOW THEM

02:15:10.769 --> 02:15:12.370
SOME KIND OF RATE REDUCTION

02:15:12.437 --> 02:15:15.073
OR TAX CREDIT -- TO COMPLICATE

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:16.575
THEIR CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO

02:15:16.641 --> 02:15:17.943
KEEP THEM IN OPERATIONS IN

02:15:18.009 --> 02:15:19.911
THAT IN THAT GOES ON BERMAN

02:15:19.978 --> 02:15:21.847
IS A PENALTY BY MUNICIPALITY

02:15:23.782 --> 02:15:25.851
YEAH I WOULD DECIDE THAT

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:27.552
-- A LOT OF STATE RESEARCH

02:15:27.619 --> 02:15:28.520
PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY

02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:30.355
ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND

02:15:30.555 --> 02:15:32.491
HAD -- DISCOVER I LIKE THAT

02:15:32.557 --> 02:15:34.426
HAS BEEN A BIG CHALLENGE WHEN A

02:15:34.493 --> 02:15:36.962
SMALL BUSINESSES STARTING TO I

02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:39.364
SEE THAT MAYBE CLOSING WAS THE

02:15:39.431 --> 02:15:41.333
SOLUTION OR THE EXIT STRATEGY

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:43.668
UNFORTUNATELY SO THERE IS A LOT

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:45.203
OF -- PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:46.771
PUT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO GUIDE

02:15:46.838 --> 02:15:47.939
A SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGH THE

02:15:48.006 --> 02:15:49.808
PROCESS TO SEE IF THAT IS REALLY

02:15:50.141 --> 02:15:52.911
THE RIDE OP NEXT A STEP

02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:54.579
OR IF THERE IS ANY SOLUTION

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:56.781
THAT COULD BE DONE BEFOREHAND

02:15:57.015 --> 02:15:58.884
I THINK THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING

02:15:58.950 --> 02:16:00.785
THAT BROUGHT BRINGS US BACK TO

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:02.420
THE OUTREACH WE NEED TO KNOW

02:16:02.487 --> 02:16:03.989
TO DO BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF

02:16:04.055 --> 02:16:05.123
A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE

02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:06.958
SUFFERING THROUGH THAT A WE'RE

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:09.194
NOT AWARE OF A LOT OF LIKE LEGAL

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:10.962
ASSISTANCE WORKSHOPS THAT COULD

02:16:11.029 --> 02:16:12.130
COULD HAVE HELPED THEM WITH THE

02:16:12.197 --> 02:16:14.232
RENT -- CONTRACTS OR WITH THE

02:16:14.299 --> 02:16:16.601
LEASES SO BEING ABLE TO GET

02:16:16.668 --> 02:16:18.403
THEM WE THOUGHT THOSE RESOURCES

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:20.071
IT'S KIND OF REALLY BRINGS OUT

02:16:20.138 --> 02:16:22.607
MORE -- LIKE BRING SOME MORE

02:16:22.674 --> 02:16:24.309

LOOK AT THE INHERITED

02:17:58.103 --> 02:18:01.406
BIASES THAT THE UNDERWRITING

02:18:01.473 --> 02:18:03.375

02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:14.899
PLAY WITH BOTH C. P. CFA AND

I BANK YEAH SO -- OTHER

02:21:17.268 --> 02:21:18.870
START OFF AND THEN SCOTT MAYBE

02:21:18.937 --> 02:21:20.205
CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:21.472
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT WE ARE

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:22.941
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE TWO

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:24.876
PROGRAMS SIMULTANEOUSLY LATE

02:21:24.943 --> 02:21:26.611
THAT CAL CAP WE HAVE A LOAN

02:21:26.678 --> 02:21:28.613
LOSS GUARANTEE PROGRAM I BANK

02:21:28.913 --> 02:21:30.114
I'M SORRY WE HAVE A LOAN LOSS

02:21:30.181 --> 02:21:31.916
RESERVE PROGRAM THE I. BANK

02:21:31.983 --> 02:21:34.419
HAS A LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM

02:21:34.485 --> 02:21:36.254
AND SO THEY ARE TO COMPLEMENT

02:21:36.321 --> 02:21:37.989
EACH OTHER LIKE MR BUYS DANIEL

02:21:38.056 --> 02:21:40.525
SAYS AND NOT COMPETING AGAINST

02:21:40.592 --> 02:21:42.060
EACH OTHER SO WE TALK ABOUT IT

02:21:42.594 --> 02:21:44.929
AS ONE PACKAGE NOT A COMPETITION

02:21:45.396 --> 02:21:47.932
-- I DO HAVE SOME RESPONSES TO

02:21:48.566 --> 02:21:51.202
SOME OF THE THE LAST PANEL

02:21:51.669 --> 02:21:54.272
UP YOU KNOW I THANK IN C. P. CFA

02:21:54.472 --> 02:21:56.608
WE ARE TO AGENCIES IF YOU LOOK

02:21:56.674 --> 02:21:58.343
AT THE S. S. B. C. I. REPORT

02:21:58.409 --> 02:22:00.011
FROM THE LAST ONE IN TWENTY

02:22:00.078 --> 02:22:02.380
ELEVEN ALMOST ALL THE STATES

02:22:02.447 --> 02:22:04.616
HAD TO ENTITIES THAT DISTRIBUTED

02:22:04.682 --> 02:22:06.217
THE FUNDS WHETHER IT WAS TO

02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:07.952
PUBLIC ENTITIES OR A PUBLIC AND

02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:09.854
A PRIVATE ENTITY AND I REALLY

02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:11.222
THINK THIS GOES TO THE CHECKS

02:22:11.289 --> 02:22:13.524
AND BALANCES THAT PEOPLE WANT

02:22:13.591 --> 02:22:15.994
TO INSTILL IN THIS PROGRAM

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:17.528
THAT YOU DON'T GO TO ONE PROGRAM

02:22:17.595 --> 02:22:19.497
THEY SAY NO BUT THEN YOU HAVE

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:21.566
ANOTHER OPTION RIGHT SO THERE'S

02:22:21.633 --> 02:22:22.901
LIKE TWO BITES OF THE APPLE

02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:25.169
INSTEAD OF JUST ONE AGENCY THAT

02:22:25.236 --> 02:22:26.804
ONCE YOU SAY NO THAT'S IT RIGHT

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:28.673
YOU HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS AND

02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:29.741
I THINK THAT'S WHY IT WAS SET

02:22:29.807 --> 02:22:31.976
UP THIS WAY AS WELL WITH A BANK

02:22:32.043 --> 02:22:34.178
AND A C. P. CFA BECAUSE YOU

02:22:34.245 --> 02:22:35.179
NEVER KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE

02:22:35.246 --> 02:22:36.648
THE EXECUTIVE AND WHO'S GOING

02:22:36.714 --> 02:22:38.483
TO BE THE TREASURE AND SOMETIMES

02:22:38.549 --> 02:22:40.551
EXECUTIVE MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME

02:22:40.785 --> 02:22:42.620
-- PRIORITIES AS THE LEGISLATURE

02:22:42.687 --> 02:22:44.656
AND SO THE LEGISLATURE HAS --

02:22:44.722 --> 02:22:46.157
INSTILLED IN THE TREASURE WITH

02:22:46.224 --> 02:22:47.325
THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE OR

02:22:47.392 --> 02:22:49.360
SOME OTHER AGENCY TO MAKE SURE

02:22:49.694 --> 02:22:51.663
THAT THERE ARE -- CHECKS AND

02:22:51.729 --> 02:22:53.965
BALANCES PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER

02:22:54.032 --> 02:22:55.500
COLLABORATING INSTEAD OF JUST

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:57.869
HOGGING ALL THE MONEY -- AND

02:22:57.936 --> 02:22:59.570
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EGG A REAL

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:01.806
LIFE EXAMPLE IF YOU IF YOU WANT

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:03.841
-- WHY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:23:03.908 --> 02:23:05.977
AGENCIES ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S

02:23:06.044 --> 02:23:08.346
OFFICE AND IN OUR OFFICE AND

02:23:08.713 --> 02:23:10.214
WHEN I WAS HERE AND GOVERNOR

02:23:10.281 --> 02:23:11.749
SCHWARZENEGGER WAS THE GOVERNOR

02:23:12.016 --> 02:23:14.218
HE WOULD NOT HAVE PUT AS MUCH OF

02:23:14.285 --> 02:23:16.120
THE BOND CAP TOWARD AFFORDABLE

02:23:16.187 --> 02:23:17.855
HOUSING HE WOULD HAVE USED THE

02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:20.358
BOND CAP FOR JAILS FOR STADIUMS

02:23:20.658 --> 02:23:23.027
-- FOUR DESALVO AND AFFORDABLE

02:23:23.094 --> 02:23:24.262
HOUSING WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN

02:23:24.329 --> 02:23:26.030
ITS FAIR SHARE AND SO HAVING

02:23:26.097 --> 02:23:27.398
THIS CHECK AND BALANCE AGAIN

02:23:27.699 --> 02:23:29.834
IS WHY I THINK THE LEGISLATURE

02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:31.369
HAS SET UP THESE PROGRAMS

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:33.371
TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT WE

02:23:33.438 --> 02:23:35.606
ARE AS FLEXIBLE AS WE CAN BE

02:23:36.174 --> 02:23:38.676
A COUPLE OF OTHER AVENUES

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:40.712
WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT WE COULD

02:23:40.778 --> 02:23:42.947
DO MORE OUTREACH IS THE WILDLIFE

02:23:43.314 --> 02:23:45.016
ACCOUNT HOLDERS ARE THAT IS A

02:23:45.083 --> 02:23:47.285
LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND --

02:23:47.352 --> 02:23:48.920
WE INVEST FOR TWENTY TWO LOCAL

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:50.922
GOVERNMENT UNITS AND THIS IS SO

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:52.423
LIKE THE CITY OF IRVINE DOESN'T

02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:54.025
HAVE TO HAVE A WHOLE INVESTMENT

02:23:54.092 --> 02:23:55.493
STAFF AND THEY COULD BETTER

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:57.095
LEVERAGE BY PULLING THE MONEY

02:23:57.161 --> 02:23:59.764
TOGETHER WITH US OUR CURRENT

02:23:59.831 --> 02:24:00.898
ACCOUNT BALANCE IS ABOUT TWO

02:24:00.965 --> 02:24:02.734
HUNDRED AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:05.636
AND SO BY A KANEMI UPSCALE

02:24:05.703 --> 02:24:08.339
AND -- BECAUSE WE ARE SO BIG

02:24:08.406 --> 02:24:10.008
CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A LOCAL

02:24:10.074 --> 02:24:12.410
AGENCIES WE ARE ABLE TO -- TO

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:15.079
GET BETTER RATES AND WE CAN USE

02:24:15.346 --> 02:24:17.882
OUR LEAF ACCOUNT HOLDERS ALSO

02:24:17.949 --> 02:24:20.018
FOR MORE OUTREACH UP FOR THESE

02:24:20.084 --> 02:24:22.120
UPCOMING PROGRAMS AND THEN CAL

SAVERS -- I CHEER CAL SAVERS

WHICH IS A RETIREMENT SAVINGS

02:24:25.957 --> 02:24:28.259
PROGRAM WE ARE RUNNING A BILL TO

BUT WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:51.682

WELL AS A DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS

02:25:10.468 --> 02:25:11.669
BUT A LOT OF THEM DON'T KNOW

02:25:11.736 --> 02:25:13.638
ABOUT IT AND THAT'S BECAUSE

02:25:13.971 --> 02:25:15.807
SOME OF THE LENDERS THAT WE WORK

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:17.942
WITH THE CD FI'S WHICH WE LOVE

02:25:18.009 --> 02:25:19.710

OR TRUST OF THESE PROVIDERS

02:25:45.536 --> 02:25:46.671

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:47.872
ASSISTANCE MONEY THAT'S COMING

02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:49.607

DON'T HAVE LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS

02:26:01.452 --> 02:26:02.920
IT'S NOT IN LANGUAGE THEY

02:26:02.987 --> 02:26:03.821
