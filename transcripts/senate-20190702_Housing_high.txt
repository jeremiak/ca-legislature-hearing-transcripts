AS SOON AS THE HOUSING TRAILER BILL THAT IS UNDER DISCUSSION AT THIS MOMENT IS PASSED. OUR PLAN IS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS BILL AMEND THE LANGUAGE FROM THE TRAILER BILL THAT ALL OF US WILL VOTER ON AND TO PROPOSE AT THIS INCREASE BE MADE FOR FIVE YEARS. WE BELIEVE THAT A STATUTORY INCREASE IS IMPORTANT RATHER THAN RELYING ON ANY WILL BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS WE KNOW THAT FOR A HOUSING DEVELOPERS LINE UP FUNDING SOURCES YEARS IN ADVANCE INVESTORS ALSO NEED CERTAINTY.

IN OPPOSITION. OUR OPPOSITION IS BASED ON WHAT IS REFERENCE IN YOUR ANALYSIS. ON PAGE EIGHT POINT. NINE THAT BECAUSE OF THIS IS A TAX CREDIT TO RETREAT WE TO STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUE. BECAUSE SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED. FORTY TWO CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. FROM STATE GENERAL FUND EFFECTIVELY A TAX CREDIT REDUCES SCHOOL FUNDING. BY 40%. A BACK TAX CREDIT ABOUT AT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. FIVE FOR YEARS MUCH USING A SIMPLE -- ONE THAT WOULD BE -- APPROXIMATELY A LOSS OF EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SCHOOLS. FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION AND FUNDING. WHAT TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BELOW ADEQUACY FUNDING LEVEL? WE WOULD URGE CONSIDERATION OF A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT HOW THIS IS FUNDED. RATHER THAN PUTTING AT RISK FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. OKAY SAYING NINE WILL BRING IT BACK -- TO SUBCOMMITTEE STILL DON'T HAVE A QUORUM -- OUR CULTURE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR YES CENTER MORE LAW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M JUST. IF YOU MADE AN INTERESTING STATEMENT TAT MOST OF THE CREDITS FOR YOU USED BY BANKS. AND COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT. SURE THE PURCHASE OF THEIR TAX CREDITS ARE TYPICALLY BANKS AND CORPORATIONS AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO. WORK WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO FUND THESE THESE PROJECTS. I'M HAPPY TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN IT BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE NON PROFITS THEY THEMSELVES. DON'T NEED THE TAX CREDIT AND SO THEY PARTNER WITH INVESTORS OFTEN IT BANKS WHO ARE TRYING TO MEET THEIR FEDERAL CRA REQUIREMENTS. INVEST THEIR DOLLARS INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- TO ENSURE THAT THAT THEIR MEETING THAT WAS THOSE GOALS IN IN IN THE DAY WE USED TO SEE. PARTNERSHIPS OF INVESTORS THAT WOULD. THE BILL THAT WE STILL HAVE IS INDICATORS THAT ARE SORT OF COUPLE INVESTOR GROUPS AND TO INVEST IN PROJECTS WE KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OF THE BUILDING THAT [inaudible] THEY REPRESENT. YOU MEAN LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MAKE. NO NO JUST A YOU KNOW HOW HOW MANY PROJECTS ARE DOING BECAUSE IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE MUCH WHEN I WAS IN MY CPA PRACTICE I DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF IT. THERE ARE TYPICALLY FIRMS THAT SPECIALIZE SPECIFICALLY. I THERE'S A HANDFUL I CAN. MEET WITH YOU HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE NOTE FIND A WERE JUST. CHAT AND IT JUST ASK SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE INCREASING THIS TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. HOW MUCH OF THAT WILL BE USED? EVERY EVERY PENNY THANKS SO ABSOLUTELY THIS THIS CURRENTLY THE CURRENT TAX CREDIT IS OVERSUBSCRIBED BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AND I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THIS WILL ALL BE PUT TO USE GIVEN THE CRISIS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. SO THEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FARM WORKER HOUSING AREA BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR THE CREDITS. WE THREE HAVE A LONG HISTORY YOUR OF OF IT BEING UNDER UTILIZED A COUPLE OF TECHNICAL CHANGES THAT WERE MADE TO THE FARMER TAX CARE PROGRAM I BELIEVE LAST YEAR -- THAT WAS GOING TO ALLOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S A SUCH A SMALL ALLOCATION ON ANNUAL BASIS THAT IT CAN FIND LIKE ONE PROJECT AND SO INCREASING THAT ALLOCATION ALLOWS. MORE THAN ONE PROJECT RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO WAIT SEVERAL YEARS TO KIND OF CAPTURE EACH FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. OR FIVE YEAH -- TOGETHER TO THEN FIND ONE PROJECT AND SO BY INCREASING AND THE SET ASIDE WHICH THIS BILL DOES IT WOULD THEN ALLOW MORE FARM WORKER PROJECTS TO BE ABLE TO FIND BE FUNDED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS INSTEAD OF COBBLING OVER SEVERAL YEARS THIS TO BE SPECIFIC ON PAGE TWO OF THE ANALYSIS -- UNDER THIS BILL NUMBER TO REFERENCE IS THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT AGGREGATE AMOUNT FOR THE SET ASIDE FOR FORMER HOUSING IS A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. WE WOULD LIFT THAT TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION DLLARS OF THE FIVE AND A MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS SOMETHING WE DID AND DEEP DISCUSSION WITH FORMER COMMUNITY. THANK YOU SIMILAR VIRTUES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY THIS SIDE OF BILL DOES ENJOY A AND I RECOMMENDATION OF ONE THANK THE AUTHOR.

OKAY MISTER GRAYSON YOUR OP -- THAT WOULD BE ITEM SIXTEEN AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE TOO MUCH THE HOUSING DATA COLLECTED AT THE STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL. IS NOT ASSESSABLE STANDARDIZED OR ORGANIZED IN A MANNER THAT LEVERAGES THE EXPERTISE OF OUR EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OF HOUSING RESEARCHERS AND ADVOCATES. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS RECENTLY COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND NEW AUTHORITIES TO TACKLE THE HOUSING CRISIS AND ACTING POLICIES TO STREAMLINE HOUSING APPROVALS. PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PROTECTING VULNERABLE TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT ROBUST DATA IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE EFFORTS. AND TO ENABLE SOUND EVIDENCE BASED POLICY MAKING IN THE FUTURE. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL SUPPORT THIS MISSION IN FOUR WAYS. IT WILL REQUIRE THE COLLECTION OF ADDITIONAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE DATA INCLUDING THE TIMELINE FOR APPLICATION APPROVAL WHETHER A PROJECT WAS SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW UNDER SEQUEL. AND WHETHER A PROJECT RECEIVED MINISTER REAL APPROVAL. IT WILL REQUIRE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO TRANSPARENTLY REPORT ON FEES AND EXACTIONS THAT APPLY TO NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. IT DIRECTS AGE CD TO IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE DATA STRATEGY INCLUDING AN EVALUATION OF DATA PRIORITIES AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF DATA SUBMITTED THROUGH ANNUAL REPORTS. AND FINALLY IT WILL FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A STATEWIDE GIS PARCEL DATABASE TO ORGANIZE AND VISUALIZE THIS DATA. I AM PLEASED TO BE WORKING WITH THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON OUR SPECIFIC DATA REQUEST TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON INFORMATION THAT IS BOTH READILY AVAILABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND DIRECTLY PERTINENT TO HOUSING POLICY MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN OUR DATA CAPACITY WILL NOT ONLY RESULT IN MORE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF OUR EXISTING HOUSING LAWS. BUT IT WILL DRIVE BETTER DECISION MAKING AS WE CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS TO OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. I HAVE THREE WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY WHO WILL REPRESENT THE BROAD RANGE OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL I'LL HAVE THEM -- WITH CHURCH PERMISSION SO INTRODUCE I THINK YOUR ANSWER BEFORE WE GET THERE -- LIGHTNING HAS STRUCK ME WHICH IS A QUORUM SO BEFORE WE LOSE IT AGAIN -- WE'RE GONNA CALL THE ROLL.

A YOUNG THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST ENGAGE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC ON LOCAL LAND USE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION ISSUES BUT EVEN TOO MANY OF THEM BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT LOCAL PROGRAMS IS OFTEN AND ACCESSIBLE. EVEN TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TECHNICAL SKILLS. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE ADDRESSES THIS INFORMATION CHALLENGE HEAD ON REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REPORT AND PUBLISH INFORMATION RELATING TO IMPORTANT LOCAL PROGRAMS AND ZONING IS A AS LIKE ZONING ORDINANCES -- AND ALLOWS VOLUNTEERS AND THE PUBLIC TO MORE EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THEIR CITY. IT'S A SOUND GOOD GOVERNMENT OPEN GOVERNMENT PROPOSAL THAT WILL ALLOW BETTER SCHISM PARTICIPATION AND LOCAL POLICY DECISION MAKING. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY% MEMBER GRAYSON FOR TO WORKING WITH US SO CLOSELY AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERING OUR MANY SUGGESTIONS -- THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION TO LOCAL ACTIVISTS AND POLICYMAKERS ENABLING THEM MORE THOUGHTFULLY ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS FOR THAT REASON WE STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS RAN AWAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM AS THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION LOOKS TO POLICY SOLUTIONS FOR ADDRESSING OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. DATA LIKE THIS THAT THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED FROM THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW US TO ENSURE THAT THOSE POLICY SOLUTIONS ARE ARE SPECIFIC TO THE PROBLEM. AND THOUGH THERE AREN'T UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FROM THE HOUSING POP FROM THOSE POLICY SOLUTIONS WHICH IS WHY DATA DRIVEN BILLS LIKE THIS ARE SO CRITICAL IN MY WHERE STRONG SUPPORTERS. ARCHER I SUPPORT TODAY. AFTERNOON SURE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANGEL BECAUSE IT -- AND I THE SCIENTIST LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING AND INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION CBA IS PLEASE IN ORDER TO SPONSOR. EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD BRING TRANSPARENCY TO FEES TAXES AND PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS BY POSTING THIS INFORMATION PUBLICLY. ACADEMICS CAN STUDY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN FEES TAXES IN HOMEBUILDING. CITIES CAN COMPARE THEIR FEES AND HOME BUILDINGS TO THEIR TO THEIR PEERS ELECTED OFFICIALS CAN MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS DECISIONS AND A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION CAN BE HAD BASED UPON CLEAR DATA. SO IN ESSENCE EIGHTY FIFTH FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE HELPS TO COLLATE VALUABLE DATA IN ORDER BRING CLARITY TO HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND THE ASSOCIATED FEES TAXES AND PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS FOR THESE REASONS.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE MUST AMENDED TO THE BILL I'M WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO DOING SOME ADDITIONAL REPORTING BUT WE DO HAVE A STRONG PREFERENCE. THAT WE DO THE DATA STRATEGY THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE BILL INCLUDING A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT CAN REALLY LOOK AT THE COST AND BENEFITS. OF REVISING LOCAL PROCESS SEES AN EXPANDING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE WE DO THE EXPANSION THE WAY THIS BILL WORKS RIGHT NOW. IS IT ADDS A LOT OF NEW DATA INCLUDING TWELVE INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF DATA THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR EVERY SINGLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE STATE. AND THEN ADDS THAT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AND WITHOUT REALLY HAVING A CONSIDERATION OF OF BOTH WHAT ARE THE COST OF COLLECTING THAT LOCALLY TO CHANGE THOSE PROCESSES ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GET PASSED ON TO DEVELOPMENT APPLICANTS IN THE FORM OF FEES. AS WELL AS THE CAPACITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSINGAND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO PUT THAT INTO A USABLE FORMAT FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SO WHAT WE WOULD STRONGLY PREFER TO DO THAT FIRST AND GO WITH THAT SECTION OF THE BILL THIS YEAR WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS OF THE APR. MIGHT BE SORT OF LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT WE CAN ADD AND I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE CAN HAVE. AS THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS -- ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THE BILL THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT I A LITTLE BIT OF A TREND THAT WE'RE SEEING THIS YEAR WHICH IS ADDING THINGS TO THE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT. BETTER REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT OF THE GENERAL PLAN IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT SPECIFICALLY IN THIS BILL THE INCLUSION OF THE ASSESSORS PARCEL DATA. IN THE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT YOU KNOW -- WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE I THINK IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE COST OF THAT WHAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE IN A STANDARDIZED FORMAT. AND IS THERE A NEED TO REPORT THAT TO EACH CD. BUT AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT GIVING A CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER WHO DOESN'T REPORT TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- ADDING THEM TO THIS APR PROCESS WHICH IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A REQUIREMENT FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR SB TO HOMELESSNESS FUNDING. FOR HOUSING BOND PROGRAMS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO REALLY IN GENERAL -- WE WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT REALLY COSTS AND BENEFITS WHAT IS THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL DATA IS EVERY PIECE OF DATA REQUIRED BY THIS BILL. GOING TO BE HELPFUL AND THEN PROCEED FROM THERE BUT FOR NOW WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION ANY GEORGE OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION WE REALLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE STAFF AND SPONSOR AND THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL -- WE HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS TO SEE SACK AND WE WANTED ALSO WOULD SAY THAT THE AND REPORT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE LIKE A MINI HOUSING ELEMENT BUT THAT'S WAY IT'S GETTING TO BE. AND WE REALLY LIKE TO STEP BACK LOOK AT ALL OF THE PAGES AND PAGES OF ANALYSIS AND REQUIREMENTS NOW. AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE EVEN HELPFUL AND THEN FIGURE OUT THE FORMAT THAT WOULD BE EASILY ASSESSABLE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S THINGS IN THERE NOW. THAT REALLY ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION TO ANYBODY BUT IT'S TAKING A LOT OF STAFF TIME -- SO WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF -- AND THE SPONSORS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS TO SEE IF WE CAN DO THAT EXERCISING CAM. ON A VALENTINE. ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR ALL THE REASONS ENUMERATED BY MY COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE THE WORK TODAY THANK YOU. THANKS FOR YOUR GOOD AFTERNOON THREE ZERO COUNTY REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO POSE LAST MINUTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE XIN OPPOSITION. THIRTY NINE WILL BRING ABOUT THE COMMITTEE COLORS OF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND MORE LOOK. IT'S MISTER JR A SERMON GRAYSON AYE AYE. I FORGET I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I SEE THE VISION. MOSTLY -- BUT I SEE LIKE MAYBE ONE CITY PREPARES IT AND YOU LEASE HAVE A TEMPLATE OR MODEL AND THEN OTHERS COULD FOLLOW. OR DO YOU HAVE A TEMPLATE THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY. SORT OF IN MIND. I I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE CURRENTLY AT THIS MOMENT A TEMPLATE I THINK IT WAS ALL I THINK WAS EXPECTED TO BE IN PARTNERSHIP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH EACH CD. COMING UP WITH SOME TYPE OF UNIFORMITY OF OF THE WAY DATA IS -- PUSHED OUT OR A RECEIVED FROM A CD SO -- WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA AND A SUGGESTION THAT WE WOULDFORWARD TO EIGHT CD AS THEY REACH OUT TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO COLLECT DATA. AND THEN I I JUST GOING TO SOME OF THE DATA YOU WANT -- COMPLETED APPLICATIONS PERMITTED UNITS. AND CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY WHICH IS ALL AYE DADDY A MEASURE THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO DIFFICULT THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE DATA WERE ASKING FOR ALREADY EXIST ON A LOCAL LEVEL -- IT'S JUST SCATTERED AND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR THEM TO DO IS TAKE MUCH OF THE DATA AND PUT IT INTO A BUCKET AND FORWARDED TO EIGHT CD SO IT'S IT'S REALLY ABOUT. JUST GATHERING IT AND FORWARDING IT AND THEN IT SAYS. AS WELL AS PROJECTS SPECIFIC DATA WHAT DOES THAT MEAN -- THAT CAN GET INTO -- US WELL SPECIFIC SUCH AS NUMBER OF UNITS -- OF A PROJECT AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS WHETHER IT BE AN INCLUSIONARY PROJECT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT -- ITEMS THAT THE CITY WAS ACTUALLY PLACING ON THAT PROJECT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD SO YOU'RE BUILDING A HUNDRED UNIT APARTMENT BUILDING AND FIRING YOU'RE PRODUCING HOW MANY SQUARE FEET OR BUT TO ME I HAVE A LESSER BUT IT COULD BE -- IN FILLED IT COULDBE EITHER A MINISTERIAL APPROVAL IT COULD BE -- WHETHER REQUIRING INCLUSIONARY -- JUST DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE WOULD PUT ON THERE MAY BE SOME PROJECTS REQUIRE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. IN ORDER TO GET THAT THROUGH TO AN APPROVAL PROCESS. WHATEVER. WHATEVER ATTACHMENTS THE BECOME WEIGHTS -- WHAT TO MILLENNIAL GONNA DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? TALK A LOT ABOUT IT. I DOUBT IT. HELP ME OUT I'M. NOT A MILLENNIAL ANY PLEASE GO AHEAD. THINKING I'D SPEAKING TO THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION -- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS US REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS IS THAT. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE MORE DATA ON THE STATE'S EIGHTY YOU AND JD YOU LAWS AND THAT WILL ALLOW US AS ADVOCATES TO HELP OUR CITIES. MAKE THEIR PROGRAMS THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCES MORE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE WE CAN SEE BETTER WHERE. THE PROGRAM'S WORKING OR MAYBE NOT WORKING AND HELP POTENTIALLY IDENTIFY BARRIERS SO THAT I THINK THE STATE LEVEL TO THAT DATA CAN BE VERY USEFUL FOR IMPROVING THE STATE'S -- STREAM MY MINISTERIAL EIGHTY YOU ANGIE EIGHTY YOU ORDINANCES IN THE FUTURE THAT'S A OBVIOUSLY VERY HOT TOPIC THIS YEAR -- BUT GOING FORWARD THIS WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER -- BUT BETTER DETERMINE IF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL SO THEN YOU'RE KIND OF HOPING TO SEE SOME TRENDS OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS BECAUSE A WHEN YOU'RE REPORT. THAT DATA IS WOULD BE KINDA USELESS IF IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY RELATION TO HOW MANY EIGHTY USE YOU DID LAST YEAR OR HOW MANY YOU ARE. PROJECTED TO TO BUILD THIS YEAR THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT WILL AT THE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS START COLLECTING THAT DATA HOPEFULLY. AND AND HOPEFULLY DETERMINE SOME OF THOSE TRENDS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO YET MAYBE NOT NEXT YEAR BUT IN THE FUTURE YES THE ONES THAT EXCITE YOU -- I I I WILL PLEAD THE FIFTH ON THAT ONE BUT I THINK MOSTLY IT'S A YOU KNOW I THINK YOU USE THE WORD SO I I I I THINK -- IN THESE ARE ARE MAYBE TO ENGAGE BUT VERY ENGAGED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ON THESE TYPES OF THINGS AND ARE VERY INTERESTED MAKING SURE THEIR LOCAL PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE. SO IF IF IF YOU PURCHASE TAKING DATA. AND AND JUST. CONSOLIDATING IT FOR EASE OF ACCESS. TASK BUT IF IF IT'S A LOT A MAKE WORK THEN I'M NOT EXCITED ABOUT PUTTING THAT ON TO A CITY OR COUNTY SO. SO HELP ME OUT -- WE SHOULD DO I'M LOOKING AT IT A LANGUAGE X. I. B. R. L. A STANDARD. WHICH WE KNOW YOU'VE PUT THE DATA IN ONCE IN AWHILE YOU CAN PROPAGATE EVERY EVERY REPORT YOU WANT TO YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY FOR IT ONCE. THEN I WOULDN'T MIND THISBUT THAT ISN'T IN A PLACE YET I'M TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I HELP THE PUBLIC BUT NOT. YOU KNOW BOGGED DOWN. YOU KNOW OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE ENJOYING A TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS THEY'RE ACTUALLY. LAYING OFF POLICE OFFICERS TO MAKE THEIR BUDGETS WORKS RIGHT I WANT TO BE CAREFUL SO TO STRIKE A GOOD BALANCE AND HAVING SERVED LOCALLY -- CENTER AYE AYE I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO MAKING SURE THAT -- WE DON'T PUT MORE ON TO CITIES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THEN WHAT IS NEEDED HOWEVER -- AS YOU FOR MULTIPLE TIMES OVER OVER WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS. I WOULD DOES SAY IT'S VERY POSSIBLE POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT WITH MUCH OF THE DATA THAT WE'RE ASKING OR DATA THAT WE'RE ASKING. FOR HAD WE HAD IT. A WHILE BACK AT LEAST A DECADE AGO I'M NOT SAYING IT WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED THIS CRISIS BUT IT SURE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US TO BE A LOT MORE PREPARED. FOR THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING AND POSSIBLY TURN THE SHIP BEFORE IT BECAME A CRISIS. SO A LOT OF THE STATE AGAIN IF THE CITY IS NOT COLLECTING IT THAT COULD POSSIBLY A TRIBUTE TO WHY THERE IS A SITUATION OR ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S NON PRODUCTIVITY. BUT IF THE DATA IS THERE I'M SURE IT'S ABLE TO BE USED TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE PROCESSES. TO BE ABLE -- TO ADMIN IS -- DO MINISTER APPROVALS ON CERTAIN PROJECTS AND THEN ALLOW OTHER PROJECTS THAT DEFINITELY NEED TO GO THROUGH A DIFFERENT PROCESS -- ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE CITY TO DO THAT BUT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE DATA THAT DATA IS THERE IN MOST CASES ALREADY SO IF I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME. IF MARIN COUNTY WOULD HAVE ADOPTED THIS TEN YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE HOW MANY MORE UNITS. I AM NOT SURE IF I CAN QUANTIFY THAT FROM THIS PODIUM RIGHT NOW APOLOGIZE FOR THROWING THAT AT YOU BUT I'M JUST. TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I THINK IT'S A A A A TEMPLATE. OR SOMETHING ALONG THAT LINE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO REPORT DATA IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY VERY OPEN. TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS AS THE BILL WOULD MOVE FORWARD IF IT WAS TO DO SO. I WAS TO START. THIS ORDER AFTER THAT THAT WHAT WE HAVE FOUND THE PAST IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE MORE DATA FOR EXAMPLE WHEN AFTER SB THIRTY FIVE OR STREAMLINING BILL PASSED. IN THE CITY RELEASED THE DATA THAT 97% CITIES WERE NOT MEETING THEIR LOW INCOME. RENO GOALS AND TWO THIRDS WERE NOT MANY ANY INCOME CORRECT. THAT CREATES ITS OWN MOMENTUM IN TERMS OF PEOPLE HAVING THEIR EYES OPENED TO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON SO IT DOESN'T ATTER BY ITSELF OBVIOUSLY BUT IT DOES. CREATE POLITICAL MOMENTUM FOR CHANGE. I CENTER DRIVE SEVEN CENTER WHAT COUNTS. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MEMBER GRAYSON AYE I DO HAVE. RELATED QUESTION TO WHAT HAS JUST BEEN SAID. AND THAT IS THAT -- THERE ARE AT LEAST FIVE TOTAL BILLS FOR OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH. DATA COLLECTION -- AND THE SO WHILE ON THE ONE HAND THERE ARE BILLS THAT WE ARE HEARING IN VOTING ON THAT CUT OUT THE STEPS. IN THE PROCESS SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THE BUILDING AND MAKING IT EASIER -- SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE OUR FOCUS IN OUR RESOURCES. DON'T GET SO CAUGHT UP ON THE INFORMATION SIDE AND I AGREE I UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF INFORMATION BUT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH FIVE DIFFERENT. BILLS. THAT. IS RELATED THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ALL FIVE BILLS GET PAST. AND SIGNED AND THEN. THAT'S FIVE DIFFERENT. WAYS OF COLLECTING THAT DATA -- AND I JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE. HILL FRUGAL ABOUT OUR RESOURCES AND OUR FOCUS -- BECAUSE WE'RE CUTTING OUT OTHER STEPS BECAUSE WE SAY IT'S TOO BURDENSOME I MEAN WE'RE EVEN SACRIFICING ELEMENTS OF SEQUEL -- SO I JUST IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT OR MAKE A SUGGESTION -- SUPPORT OF BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT ADDRESS A THANK YOU FOR EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERN AND WE DID LOOK AT THAT AND WE ARE AWARE OF THE OTHER BILLS -- HOWEVER WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER BILLS AS AS WELL INTENDED IN AS GOOD AS THEY ARE AND THEY SORT OF AN INCREDIBLE PURPOSE FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY'RE VERY SPECIFIED TO THE DATA COLLECTION THAT THEY ARE CALLING FOR FOR INSTANCE A BILL THAT'S THIS VERY SPECIFIC AND NARROW TO JUST FARM WORKER HOUSING. AND THAT'S THE DATA THE COLLECTING IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE ARE COLLECTING A BROAD ACROSS THE BOARD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS FAR AS HOUSING AND HOW IT'S BEING APPROVED ON A CITY LEVEL OR A COUNTY LEVEL -- SO IT COVERS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM HI I AM VERY SENSITIVE -- TO CENTERED MORE LOCK AND WHAT HE HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT TRYING TO GATHER THE DATA AND WHAT OKAY. WELL -- AS FAR AS GATHERING THAT I'M I APPRECIATE THAT IS ALL BUT GATHERING DATA IN A WAY THAT WE CAN -- AGGREGATE IT AND BE ABLE TO DISSEMINATE IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY RATHER THAN JUST KEEPING PEOPLE BUSY AND CREATING MORE WEIGHT AND HEAVY. HEAVY LOAD AND IF I MAY KNOW WE ARE AWARE THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE DATA BILLS CAN SOME OVERLAP AND WE'VE COMMITTED WE'VE ALERTED ALL THE AUTHORS THAT OVER THE SUMMER -- WE INTEND. TO TRY TO WORK WITH ALL THE RELEVANT COMMITTEES TO TRY MISSION ARE HARMONIZED AND THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND DON'T CREE DUPLICATION. SIMILAR TO THE E. D. U. SITUATION THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EIGHTY YOU BILLS. I THINK WE'RE ALL COMMITTED TO HARMONIZING THEM BEFORE APPROPRIATIONS AND I'M READY TO SING HARMONY. AND I I NEED TO RUN TO VOTE IN PUBLIC SAFETY IN NUMBERS AND SYMBOLS ASSEMBLY SO I AM GOING TO HAND THE GAVEL TO SENATOR BATES IF SHE'S GOING TO TAKE IT -- AND I WILL RETURN TO THANK YOU. SENDER ACOSTA. I GUESS THAT OUR STAFF REPORT. SAYS THE YEARS IS THE BIGGEST AND THE **** FROM THE MOST DATA SO THERE'S THERE'S THAT THE PUT IN IS FOR TALKING WITH THE OTHER FOUR AUTHORS ON THE COLLECTION-DATA BUT I WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE TOWARDS THE END OF THE STAFF REPORT. WE GOT. TALKING ABOUT RESOURCES EIGHT C. D. N. HOUSING COMMUNITY FELLMAN HASN'T EVEN HIRED THE PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED TO HIRE TO WORK ON THE STREAMLINING AND THE LAND USE MEASURES IN THIS SEPT FIFTEEN BILLS WE PASS. TWO YEARS AGO. SO WOULD. IT NOW WITH. I'VE HEARD TESTIMONY WE WANT DATA DAT IS GOOD I GOT ALL THAT BOTH BUT HOW DO YOU RECONCILE. THE WORKLOAD THAT AT T.. IS PUTTING ON BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF FIVE DATA BILLS. SO BACK -- TO MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS I'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH A BROAD RANGE OF HOUSING STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING PLANNING STAFF ADVOCATES DEVELOPERS RESEARCHERS REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS. THE BILL'S CURRENT DATA REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE WHICH EMERGED FROM STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AS HAVING THE STRONGEST JUSTIFICATION THAT ALSO INCLUDED AIDS EIGHT CITIES INPUT AS TO WHAT THEY BELIEVE WOULD BE IMPORTANT DATA. A CD ALSO RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY A SENSIBILITY COORDINATION AND QUALITY OF THEIR DATA FUNCTIONS. SO IS MY FACT IF I MAY QUOTE THEM IN FACT -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TWENTY D. REPORT CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING FUTURE THE DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION TRANSPARENCY ANALYSIS AND ANALYSIS RELATED TO REDUCING HOUSING COST. PER UNIT WHERE POSSIBLE IN STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS SO THIS IS STATED THAT THEY'RE PREPARED -- TO TAKE ON THAT THEY HAVE LITERALLY ASK FOR AND ARE TAKING THE MEASURES -- TO BE ABLE. TO ACCOMMODATE -- THE REQUEST OF THIS BILL YES FINGERS QUE OKAY. I'M OF THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION I JUST NOW MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT SINCE WE WON'T FOR A LONG THINK QUESTIONING I JUST LIKE THE THE B. I. AID. TO GIVE US SOME COMFORT LEVEL THAT THIS ISN'T ANOTHER FEE THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON ARE THE COST TO HOUSING BECAUSE THEY SEE THE WITH A REQUIREMENTS HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE ON PERSONNEL YEARS ALL OF THAT STARTS. TO BE BUILT IN OUT LOCAL ARE CERTAINLY AT STATE LEVEL. COULD YOU GUYS ARE SUPPORTING AND IT'S KINDA LIKE IS THIS GOING TO BE ANOTHER. INCREASE MINOR HOWEVER ON THE CASA HOUSING. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT THAT YOU BRING FOR IT -- WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO ANYTHING THAT INCREASES THE COST OF HOUSING AND GENERALLY ARE VERY OPPOSE. AS FAR AS WE SEE IT THIS IS A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE A LOT OF TIME ARE GUYS WHO ARE BUILDING THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE FEES ARE GOING TO BE OR WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST BECAUSE THERE'S N PLACE THAT THIS IS BEING PUBLICLY DISCLOSED. IT'S HAPPENING IN OUR GUYS PAID THE PAID AT A LOCAL LEVEL THERE'S NEGOTIATIONS A HAPPEN BUT WHAT THIS WILL DO WITH THIS BILL WILL DO IS ALLOW FOR THE INFORMATION TO BE COLLATED AND PUT INTO A CENTRAL REPOSITORY FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT NOW. SO **** WHEN THEY DO FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS THEY CAN HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THERE WAS IN THE PAST THAT'S THE IDEA THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE TRANSPARENT IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU COULD REDUCE FEES. RIGHT. THE WAY WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- MADAM SECRETARY WILL CALL THE ROLL -- YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THEIR FAMILY MEMBER GRAYSON I RESPECTFULLY IT WILL FIRST WHILE I WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAME TOGETHER TO HELP MAKE THIS POSSIBLE AND I RISKS AND TO COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL. AS OTHER MEMBERS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. THANK YOU. MA'AM SECRETARY IN COLORADO AND THIS ISN'T ABLE FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE BY SOME OF THE GRAYSON MOTION IS TO PASS REFER THE COMMANDMENTS OF FINANCE SENATOR WIENER. MORROW BATES AYE BATES AYE CAMARO DRAWS OKAY. DRAWS A AYE MCGUIRE MORLOCK ROTH. ROTH AYE SKINNER UMBERG. UNDER I AM A CASKEY. BECAUSE HE I FIVE ZERO THE FIVE VOTES WOULD THROW OPEN FOR THOSE WHO ARE HERE. WHICH IS OUR NEXT. WHO'S OUT THERE [inaudible] MR. ONE SEVEN THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO I BELIEVE YOUR BILL IS NEXT. NOW -- ASSEMBLY IN -- BILL ONE SEVENTY THREE CRAFT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH ESTABLISHED A TAX ABATEMENT PROGRAM CALLED. REGISTER YOUR MOBILE HOME CALIFORNIA. IT IS A PROGRAM FOR MOBILE HOME OWNERS WHO ARE UNABLE TO TRANSFER TITLE OF THEIR HOMES. INTO THEIR NAMES DUE TO TAX DELINQUENCIES THAT WERE INCURRED BY PRIOR OWNERS. SINCE THE PROGRAM STARTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN MOBILE HOMEOWNERS HAVE SAVED. OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THE PROGRAM IS ON SCHEDULE TO SAVE MOBILE HOMEOWNERS. TWO MILLION DOLLARS BY THE TIME IT SUNSETS ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN DESPITE THE SUCCESS SO THERE ARE STILL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM. THISBILL AB ONE SEVENTY THREE WOULD SIMPLY EXTEND THE SUNSET ON THE PROGRAM FOR ONE YEAR. TO CONTINUE TO HELP ABOUT MOBILE HOMEOWNERS SHOT WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU A WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE. IN SUPPORT. YES GOOD AFTERNOON I BROUGH STANTON CORPORATE COUNSEL FOR THE GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURED HOMEOWNERS LEAGUE. WHERE A FIFTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE ACTUALLY YEAR OLD NONPROFIT CORPORATION NOW REPRESENTING THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS STATEWIDE AND I'M HERE TO URGE YOUR AYE VOTE? THE ENACTMENT OF AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN HAS RESULTED IN THE CURE OF DEFECTIVE TITLE FOR NEARLY TWO THOUSAND MOBILE HOMEOWNERS. BUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MOBILE HOMES ARE STILL NOT PROPERLY TITLED IN THE NAME OF THEIR OWNERS AND WE DO NEED TO EXTEND THIS VALUABLE PROGRAM. THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY NO ES SCREWS BEING USED SOMETIMES NO PROPER TRANSFER OF TITLE THERE FOR CURRYING -- STILL OUT OF BUSINESS LENDERS WHO CAN'T BE REMOVED FROM TITLE. OR PARKS SALES PARK OWNER SALES OF HOMES WITH BAD TITLE FOR THAT THIS IS THE REQUIREMENTS OF TRANSFERRED JUST NOT FOLLOWED. AS A RESULT WE HAVE HOMEOWNERS A RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES IF THE PARK OWNER SITES VIOLATION OF RULES FOR HAVING TITLE IN NOT HAVING TITLE IN THEIR NAMES. WE HAVE HOMEOWNERS WHO CAN'T GET LOANS ARE ACCESS HOME EQUITY AND WE HAVE HOMEOWNERS WHO CAN'T GET BUILDING PERMITS FROM THE STATE. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TWO WAYS OF TITLING A REGISTERING HOMES ONE IS I. L. T. THEIN LIEU OF TAX WHICH IS PAID TO H. CD. THE OTHER IS L. P. T. WHICH IS LOCAL PROPERTY TAX PAID TO COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR'S. THERE'S AT LEAST A FIFTY FIFTY SPLIT BUT THE L. P. T.. PROPERTY TAX IS BECOMING MORE -- NUMEROUS BECAUSE A NEW HOMES ARE AUTOMATICALLY L. P. T.. AND HOMES CAN ALSO BE TRANSFERRED TO A P. T. TO AVOID SALES USE TAX. ALTHOUGH THE PENETRATION OF THE PROGRAM HASN'T BEEN AS GOOD AS WE DESIRE IN GSM WELL IN OUR SISTER OF FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ARE VERY COMMITTED -- TO BETTER OUT REGION EDUCATION ESPECIALLY TO HISPANIC AND VIETNAMESE HOMEOWNERS. WHO CAN BE VERY WARY AND DISTRUSTING OF ANY KIND OF GOVERNMENT -- OR ANYTHING RELATED TO GOVERNMENT. BUT WE DO HAVE STATISTICS AS OF MARCH SHOWING -- ALMOST TWO THOUSAND COMPLETED APPLICATIONS. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THE L. P. T. COUNTY APPLICATIONS ARE FEWER. THERE WAS A TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY COMPLETED AS OF MARCH. THE PERCENTAGE OF WAVES -- COSTS AND AND TAXES WITH 62%. SO KEEPING THE LOCAL PROPERTY TAX UNITS AS PART OF THE PROCESS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. AND NARROWING THE PROGRAM TO REMOVE THEM AS THE OPPOSITION HAD -- SUGGESTED WOULD TAKE AT LEAST HALF OF THE POPULATION OUT OF THE PROCESS -- I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING SMALL IS NOT A PRINCIPLE SIZE FROM EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE STATE'S LAWS AND POLICIES SO WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. SECOND WHEN OF YES GOOD AFTERNOON SURE IN SENATORS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ROGER JOHNSON ANIMAL MOBILE HOMEOWNER WHO LIVES IN LAKE VIEW VILLAGE IN CITRUS HEIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE GOLDEN STATE MOBILE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION GSMA OIL. REPRESENTING SENIORS VETERANS IMMIGRANTS AND OTHER LOW. MODERATE AND FIXED INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. WHO LIVE IN MOBILE HOME PARKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE? WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TRAIL FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL. IN AB ONE SEVEN THREE WILL HELP MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS WHO WERE TRYING TO TRANSFER. TITLE IN THEIR NAME IN THE STATE AND COUNTIES. WHO CAN NOW UPDATE THEIR RECORDS SO THAT ON COLLECTED TAXES AND FEES CAN BE COLLECTED FROM THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY -- THEM. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR-SUPPORT IN THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE OTHERS HERE I IN SUPPORT THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. IF NOT OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAROLING BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS -- WHEN THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS PUT THROUGH I HAVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN WE SPENT AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THE SPONSORS AT THAT TIME? TO CRAFT LANGUAGE THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD NARROWLY. ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE THAT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PROCESS THEIR PAPERWORK IN THE PURCHASE THE HOME. BUT WE HAD A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT A HOMES I'M MORE THAN ONE HOME BEING TAKEN TO THE PROCESS BY A SINGLE OWNER. SINCE THAT BILL WAS PASSED WITHOUT OUR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. WE HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WHEN AB ONE SENATORS INTRODUCED THAT THAT A PARK HONOR IN KERN COUNTY HAS TAKEN THIRTY HOMES THROUGH THE PROCESSES IN WHAT'S CALLED THE WAREHOUSE MEANS LEANS FAIL. SO ESSENTIALLY ABANDONED HOMES ARE SOLD THROUGH AN AUCTION FOR A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEN THE PARK HONOR OBTAINS OWNERSHIP OF THAT HOME. AND GETS TO WIPE AWAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE PROPERTY TAXES THAT ARE LOW -- TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE HAVE ASKED THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER TAILORING THE BILL TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF OUR HUSBANDS LEANS. AS IN AS IN THE SALE IF YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO TAKE THE HOME THROUGH. THE AMNESTY PROGRAM THAT HAS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED WERE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL THAT WAS INITIALLY PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE WAS INTENDED TO HELP PEOPLE. WHO DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PROCESS PAPERWORK I PROMISE YOU THE PARK OWNERS KNOW WHAT PAPERWORK NEEDS TO BE DONE? BUT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE USING IT AND FOR THE TWO HUNDRED OR SO THAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THIRTY IN ONE COUNTY IS DONE BY THE PARK OWNER. UP IN SUTTER COUNTY. ALL THREE ONE PARK HONOR SO WE'RE ASKING FOR YOU. TO I TAKE A HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE PROBLEM. PARK OWNERS DON'T KNOW WHICH HOMES ARE UP TO DATE AND WHICH AREN'T BECAUSE WE GAVE AWAY THE STICKER PROGRAM IS TO HAVE SO PARK OWNERS DON'T KNOW WHO'S UP TODAY AND HE'S NOT. A WE THINK THERE ARE SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE GIVING AWAY COUNTY TAX DOLLARS SO WE'RE OPPOSE UNLESS THE BILL AS AMENDED TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHER SIDE IN OPPOSITION THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. SEEN ON THE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I ANY QUESTIONS. YES SENATOR ROBB. THANK CENTER UP PERHAPS OF IF THE AUTHOR COULD RESPOND TO THE COMMENTS FROM THE COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR'S I MEAN OBVIOUSLY. AS A STATE. WE HAVE WE HAVE HAD SOME IMPACT ON COUNTY FINANCES BY VIRTUE OF THE ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN UP HERE AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL AND SO I'M STE. WELL I'M SENSITIVE TO INDIVIDUAL. HOMEOWNERS I AM ALSO SENSITIVE TO THE COUNTY CONCERNS ABOUT ALLOWING -- INSTITUTIONAL OPERATORS. TO IN THIS CASE NOT GAME THE SYSTEM BUT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE FOR THEIR OWN IT -- ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION. I HAVE NO ISSUES -- ABOUT BOB PARK OWNERS SELL REALLY USING THE PROGRAM PER SE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF THEY ARE INDEED. OWNERS OF THE UNITS I THINK THE FOCUS OF THE BILL AND ALSO THIS PARTICULAR. ONE SEVENTY THREE IS ON ARE MAKING SURE THAT THESE UNITS ARE PROPERLY TITLE. ON YOU KNOW I THINK IN MANY INSTANCES. THE UNITS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT ARE IN FACT OWNED BY THE PARK OWNERS. TO OUR YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN ABANDONED UNITS OR OTHERWISE STATE NEVERTHELESS THEY STILL ONLY UNITS AND AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE FOCUS OUGHT TO BE. A WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EACH ONE OF THESE UNITS IS PROPERLY TITLES SO THAT THEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED ALL LEGALLY OTHERWISE AS WE HEARD FROM THE WITNESS. YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL KINDS OF ISSUES THAT COULD ARISE FROM MOM ALL TITLES THAT HAVE CLOUT OF FOR EXAMPLE THEY GET EVICTED THEY THEY CAN'T PAY -- TO THEY CAN'T. DO ANYTHING WITH IT THEY CAN'T TRANSFER SO THAT'S THE UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND SO SO THE FOCUS OUGHT TO BE ON THAT YOU KNOW THESE UNITS SAW PROPERLY TITLE. ARE LEGALLY SO THAT THEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED. SO I WOULD I WOULD ASSUME A PARK OWNERS IT HAS ABANDONED -- MOBILE HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOMES IN THE PARK AS AN INCENTIVE. TO TAKE CARE OF THEM DEAL WITH THEM APPROPRIATELY BUT MAY NOT NECESSARILY NEED A PROPERTY TAX -- WE WERE EXEMPTION IN ORDER TO DO SO I NOTICES BILLS DOUBLE REFERRED SO PERHAPS OF US SUPPORTED TODAY OBVIOUSLY PERHAPS YOU COULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS I'LL BE HAPPY. TO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS THEM NOW. YOU MAY CLOSE SOMEWHERE CHALLENGE WILL CALL THE ROLL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ARRIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

EFFICIENT APPLIANCES REPLACEMENT OF LIGHTING SUCH AS SALLY DE. ESCALATION OF FOUR WILL TASTE SOLAR PANELS AND INSTALLATION OF BATTERY BACKUPS -- THIS BILL'S BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE-BEFORE AB HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS MICHAEL SATURDAY WITH LA BUT AT THE WAS HERE ANSWERING TECHNICAL QUESTIONS SPENT PLANTS FOR RIVAL.

THIRTY FOUR OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AGRICULTURAL COUNTIES OF THE STATE. THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FARMWORKERS. IN ABOUT 18% OF THEM OWN HOME -- AND WE FEEL. THERE THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT HAS HAD PROGRAMS. OF THIS NATURE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGE TO REACH THE FARM WORKERS COMMUNITIES AND DRAW FARMWORKERS THEMSELVES. SO I THINK THIS LEGISLATION THE LEGISLATION WILL ENSURE THE FARMWORKERS HOLES WILL RECEIVE EXTENSIVE WEATHERIZATION. SOLAR PANELS IN ADDITION TO BATTERY BACKUPS. THIS PROGRAM. WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE CARBON PRINT. OF THE FARM WORKER POPULATION BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY. HEWILL DO SOMETHING ELSE IT WILL RAISE THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOME.

OF AFFORDABLE BOTH WORK FORCE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY OF APPROXIMATELY AT THE TIME BETWEEN FIFTY FIVE AND NOW 650-00 PEOPLE.

THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN YEARS OLD BECAUSE I NO LONGER HAD A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. WHAT UP TO OVERWHELMING AMOUNTS OF ADVERSITY? BEN HOLMES YOU COULD'VE BEEN DETRIMENTAL HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SUPPORT OF A SCHOOL PSYCHIATRIST. OR THE OPEN DOORS OF THE HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTER BY THE LOS ANGELES YOUTH NETWORK NOW KNOWN AS YOU THE MERGING STRONG. THERE I HAD SUPPORTIVE ADULTS MENTORS. ACCESS TO MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE [inaudible] FOOD [inaudible] EDUCATION SUPPORT SHOWERS A BED AND A ROOF OVER MY HEAD. ONE WEEKS ON THE STREETS ALONE HAVING TO FIND WAYS TO EAT STAY CLEAN GO TO SCHOOL STAY SAFE. AND HOPEFULLY HAVE AN UNINTERRUPTED NIGHT. OF SLEEP DURING THE THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE EXPERIENCED BY ANYONE ESPECIALLY OUR YOUTH TODAY. I'VE SEEN A TIME WHILE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT BADGE DROP IN SHELTERS. AND YOUTH HOMELESS SHELTERS DECREASE CAPACITY AND SOME EVEN CLOSE ALL TOGETHER. AND DESPAIR IT DISPARITIES AMONG MY PEERS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. TODAY I HOPE TO SEE A LIVE IN A TIME WHERE YOU HOMELESSNESS IS SHORT LIVED. WHERE AND NOW RECURRING? SO THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. YOUR TIME IS APPRECIATED. AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SHERRY SHARE AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TRIBAL [inaudible] THANK YOU. CAN LARA'S REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOU AND ONE OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE WE KNOW WE NEED AN ARRAY OF PROGRAMS. ACROSS THE STATE AND IN ALL COUNTIES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT THE STORIES. AND THE EXPERIENCES THAT OF ON JUST SHARED. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE INTERVENE EARLY WE CAN AND AND PREVENT YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. AND MAKE A SERIOUS DENT IN ENDING OUR CHRONIC HOMELESS NUMBERS. IT'S NO SURPRISE TO ME AND THAT THE NUMBER OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS POPULATION HAS BEEN GOING UP BECAUSE WE HAVE UNDER INVESTED RESOURCES. AS POPULATION FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. THE ONLY ONE TIME ONGOING PROGRAM IS THAT -- YES AND HAS LESS THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS N A ONE TIME ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS AND FOR COUNTIES. THE ONLY OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THROUGH THE FEDERAL RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH ACT WHICH PROVIDES GRANTS OF NO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUALLY. SO TO ME IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ARE COUNTIES LACK RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND SO IF WE CAN CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S WORKING IN COLLABORATION UNDERNEATH THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL WE CAN REALLY ENSURE THAT THAT YOUR INTENT OF SB NINE ONE EIGHT THE HOMELESS YOUTH ACT TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAN BE MEANT. TO ENSURE THAT WE AND AND REDUCE. YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. I'M WE'VE ONCE WE CREATE THE GRANT PROGRAM WE CAN REALLY WORKED ADVOCATE AND ENSURE THAT THE ON GOING FUNDING IS APPROPRIATED AND DEDICATED FOR THIS AND IT ALSO CREATES A STRUCTURE. FOR THINGS OF THE MINISTRATION COULD CONSIDER AND USE OF THE PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDS BECAUSE THIS ALLIANCE WITH CLEARLY THE YOUTH -- TREATMENT ACCOUNT WHEN IT CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE EDUCATION OUT REGION TREATMENT OF HOMELESS AND OUT OF SCHOOL YOUTH EXPERIENCING SUBSTANCE ABUSE. I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IF WE INTERVENE ON DAY ONE FOR OUR YOUTH. AND WHERE WOULD WE BE TODAY. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT PLEASE SAY YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. SAM DASH OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON TO SHARI'S RUN ON BEHALF COUNTY BEAVER HELL TRACTORS A STATION IN STRONG SUPPORT.

KATHY VAN AUSTIN ON BEHALF OF JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. I SING ON IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. MOTION BY SENATOR ROTH -- CENTER MORE LOOK. Q. MATTER STRUCTURE I'M JUST. CURIOUS ABOVE WHERE THE FUNDING IS COMING FROM SO I'M HEARING PROP SIXTY FOUR IN HEARING. USE EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION TREATMENT ACCOUNT AND GIFTS AND DONATIONS SO WE'RE WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM THE TO FUND THE YOUTH EDUCATION. PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION ACCOUNT. I WILL ASK OUR WITNESS TO RESPOND TO THAT. IF I MAY. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO SET UP THE GRANT PROGRAM THEN WE CAN ADVOCATE FOR AN APPROPRIATION THE BUDGET NEXT YEAR AS WELL WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PUTS FORWARD OR NOT -- WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN AND OTHER -- BILLS OF THE LEGISLATURE'S BUT FORWARD AND HAVE PASSED AND IMPLEMENTED AND THEN BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY SECURE THAT APPROPRIATION OUT YEARS. SO WE'RE JUST SETTING SOMETHING UP WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY RESOURCES AT THIS TIME. NOT ON GOING DEDICATED FOR THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM IT'S JUST MINISTERIAL. NO HOPE FOR ANYTHING IT'S ALWAYS SO ARE ASKED THERE'S GREAT HOPE. THIS IS GREAT -- BUT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE SETTING UP THE POLICY WE ARE. MAKING THESE. SB I'M IN FOR THE CURRENT YEAR NOT. FOR INDEFINITE POLICYMAKERS WHERE WE'RE LETTING IT BE KNOWN THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR US. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND OFFENDER CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE AT THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ALSO FOR ON THE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. MINE IS A TECHNICAL ISSUE AND AND I'M I'M I'M. I'M GONNA HAVE. TO MENTION IT A NUMBER OF TIMES TODAY BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT -- THAT START TO BUILD -- UPON. COUNCILS ARE COMMITTEES THAT WERE SET UP TO DO SOME SOME -- SOME TECHNICAL WORK BUT REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY -- EXPERIENCE IN HANDLING GRANT -- APPLICATIONS IN THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S REQUIRED TO DO REVIEWING GRANTS -- AND HAVING COME FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE I'M REALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU START BUILDING THE BUREAUCRACY THEN YOU SPEND MORE MONEY ON THE BUREAUCRACY THAN YOU ACTUALLY SPENT. ON GRANTS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SO THIS THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL WAS SET UP LAST YEAR. AND AND AND THIS YEAR EVERYBODY'S THROWING THEM A LOT OF WORK FOR THEM TO DO AND I'M JUST CONCERNED WITH GIVING THEM UP AB FAB. PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT. IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ON ANIMAL AND THIS THIS IS LOCATED IN AN AGENCY. WHICH AT THE AGENCY LEVEL YOU DON'T DO GRANTS GENERALLY AND SO I'M JUST I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT IT. FRANKLY I THINK IT GOES BETTER AT EACH CD OR ANY OF THE HOUSING AGENCIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH WITH -- CREATING THE GUIDELINES FOR GRANT. FOR REVIEWING APPLICATIONS COMPETITIVE APPLICATIONS THAT COME IN AND THEN -- FOR DOING THE GRANT AWARDING AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT THE AWARD DIS -- ACTUALLY DID WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO AND THAT'S A WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH ACCOUNTABILITY BUILT IN THAT. IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THIS AT FINANCING COUNCIL SO I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE MINUTES SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WORK. THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE SO -- A RESERVES THE RIGHT TO A DIFFERENT DECISION ON THE FLOOR BUT BUT I I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR YOU SO THINK THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL THIS IS IMPORTANT. IN MY RESPOND -- STRUCTURE. WITHIN THE THE THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IT DOES SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT THE COUNCIL MAY ENTER INTO AN INTRA INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GRANT PROGRAM. YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL TAKE AND IF THEY ARE NOT PREPARED OR DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY OF THE IT DOES PROVIDE FOR THAT POSSIBILITY. THANK YOU SENATOR. OKAY ROOM MOTION BY A CENTER OUGHT TO TO THE CITIZENS ARE IN AYE RECOMMENDATION ON WHAT THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THIS ON THIS IS IMPORTANT WORK -- WE'VE I THINK IT'S BEEN A GROUP EFFORT% FOR A FEW YEARS AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STOP AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS. OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS FROM THE QUESTIONS I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY INDICATE WHAT ARE. WHAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE WHAT THE POLICY IS THAT WE WANT TO TAKE FORWARD ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HOMELESS YOUTH WE ALREADY KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE? THE THE ISSUE IN THE FUTURE. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOTION MOTION ROTH WILL CALL THE ROLL.

THERE GOING TO SHOW A RETAINER I'M GOOD WITHOUT A GAVEL YOU'RE WELL MANNERED. ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY FOR OF YOU CENTER -- THANK YOU SENATOR WE ARE THANK YOU ARE CONTENT TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS.

WELL WE ARE UPDATING MY BILL FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FIVE FOR STRENGTH IN THE SURPLUS LAND DOCTOR WE THINK IT'S A GREAT TOOL. TO SUPPLY MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. COURAGE ALL THE DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT HAVE SURPLUS LAND AVAILABLE TO AGAIN PRIORITIZE OUT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNFORTUNATELY AFTER TWENTY FOURTEEN WE SAW. MANY AGENCIES TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT THAT LEGISLATION SORE COMING BACK TO TIGHTEN IT WITH A COUPLE DIFFERENT PROVISIONS TO WANT. TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE EXISTING PROVISIONS INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF SURPLUS LAND. I ALSO CREATING A STATEWIDE DATABASE OF LOCAL SURPLUS LANDS. WE WANT TO LEVERAGE. HOUSING -- IN THE LAW TO PROMOTE THE USE OF EFFICACY OF THE SURPLUS LAND THAT WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES WHO ARE BE. MUCH MORE ELOQUENT THAN ME AND TO ASK THEM TO SPEAK. GOOD AFTERNOON TERM OR LONG TERM THANK YOU MY NAME IS PEDRO DAVAO AND I'M WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE OF AND LONG STANDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION CELEBRATING OUR FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR. AND OUR MISSION IS TO SEE A BAY AREA WHERE EVERYONE HAS AN AFFORDABLE AND STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME -- AND WE'RE HERE TODAY AS SPROUT CO SPONSORS OF FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERYONE HAS AN AFFORDABLE AND STABLE PLACE TO LIVE. AND PUBLICLY OWNED LAND CAN PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING THAT HAPPEN. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF PUBLICLY OWNED LAND THAT LIFE THEY CAN'T OR PARKING LOTS. CAN BE PRIORITIZE TO BENEFIT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THE WAY PEOPLE DO THAT IS BY CLARIFYING AND STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA SURPLUS LAND ACT THIS IS A FIFTY YEAR OLD LAW. WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE THAT SURPLUS LAND IS USED FOR PUBLIC GOOD BY PRIORITIZING THE LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. MANY PRACTICAL OBSTACLES EXIST TO ENFORCING THE SURPLUS LAND ACT THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP CORRECT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING HAS ALREADY TOUCHED ON BUT WE WANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO MAKE THIS LAW. IMPLEMENTABLE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH IT HAS BEEN THAT IT HASN'T BEEN ENFORCED. AND THROUGH THAT WORK WE HAVE TAKEN -- OVER SIXTY AMENDMENTS BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL HAS BEEN MADE STRONGER THROUGH THOSE AMENDMENTS AND NOW WE ARE HERE TODAY. TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BRING TO LIFE A PROMISE THAT IT MADE OER FIFTY YEARS AGO THE PUBLIC LAND OUGHT TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC GOOD. AND WE THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN MORE LOCKER HONORABLE MEMBERS EFFORT GOT A YOU'LL HEAR WITH BURBANK HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER OUT OF CINEMA AND NAPA COUNTIES. FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS WE HAVE LED THE NORTH BAY AND PROVIDING IN CREATING AND MAINTAINING QUALITY. SUSTAINABLE HOUSING AFFORDABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE -- DEVELOP A LAND IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST HURDLES AND BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OFTEN -- NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS AND UP WITH THE PARCELS MOST DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP AND FREQUENTLY PASSED ON BY FOR A FOR PROFIT DEVELOPERS. BUY MORE EFFICIENTLY TRANSFORMING UNUSED PUBLIC LANDS INTO PUBLIC COULD. NOT PROFIT DEVELOPERS LIKE US I CAN DO MORE. WE DO BELIEVE THAT BY CLARIFYING AND STRENGTHENING THE PROVISIONS OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACT WE'LL BE ABLE TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR A COMMUNITIES. THIS ISSUE HAS ONLY BECOME A GREATER -- IN OUR COMMUNITY IN THE NORTH BAY. WHERE WE HAVE LOST A THOUSANDS OF HOMES -- DUE TO THE RECENT WILDFIRES IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE CURRENTLY ON A WAIT LIST -- WE MUST LOOK AT ALL AVAILABLE TOOLS AND PUBLIC LANDS KIAN IN TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN OUR REBUILDING EFFORTS. AS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN CINEMA. I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING ON THE COUNTY -- ON THE COUNTIES HOUSING FOR ALL A STRATEGY THAT FOCUSED ON RE USING SELECT COUNTY ON PROPERTIES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AT THAT IF IMPLEMENTED COULD BRING UP TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED UNITS OF A HOUSING IN THE COMING YEARS. THERE IS GREAT ALIGNMENT WITH WHAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALREADY DOING THESE ARE COUNTIES CITIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS ABOUT COLLEGE AND LOCAL -- TO PROMOTE -- INVOLVING PUBLICLY OWNED PARCELS I'D LIKE TO IN MY REMARKS THIS AFTERNOON -- WITH A DEVELOPMENT THAT OCCURRED TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO AT THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA OWNED A VACANT ON USE PARCEL. LATER DONATED TO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HABITAT WAS ABLE TO BUILD ITS FIRST HOME -- IN THE COUNTY THROUGH THAT PARTNERSHIP THOUGH I WAS ONLY TEN YEARS OLD WHEN THAT DEVELOPMENT OCCURRED. I KNOW IT SO WELL BECAUSE MY FAMILY HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO LIVE IN THAT HOME. FOR MY WORKING PARENTS THIS WAS A PIVOTAL POINT IN REALLY A GAME CHANGER AND CERTAINLY FOR ME. TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CHANGES LIVES I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES -- DILIGENCE ON THIS AND WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ARE FROM GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MATH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ERIN EVENTS ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND SUPPORT. ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA U. M. B. TMZ PARTNERS AND SILICON VALLEY AT HOME ALL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MALLORY SPOKE WITH CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ONE OR THE SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MATTHEW ONE WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. A SEVENTY I ON BEHALF OF WORKING PARTNERSHIPS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. MARINO I AM AT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM IN SUPPORT. JULIE SNYDER ON BEHALF OF HOUSING CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. TIFFANY FAN OF HOW THE BRIDGE HOUSING IN SUPPORT. YEAH I'M STILL KEEPING TRACK OF EVERYONE THAT. COMING TO THE MICROPHONE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TO EPHRON [inaudible] GEN. IS IT A FORMER SUPERVISOR CARILLO SIR. YOU KNOW I I WORE A DODGER TIGHT TODAY. BROWN IS IT MYSELF [inaudible] IT'S FORTY KITCHEN ANGEL TIE. I'M GONNA HALOS PAN. NEVER IN OPPOSITION THAT I HAVE FOR AND BUT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THE LEGISLATION KYLE PACKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR -- AND HIS STAFF AND THE SPONSORS FOR THE ROBUST DIALOGUE THAT HAS BEEN ON GOING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR -- WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO DO SO WE ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR MCGUIRE AND HIS STAFF IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE FOR A LOT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT GOT WORKED OUT -- PREVIOUSLY THAT OUR TEAM OUR MEMBERS ARE STILL ENGAGED IN REVIEWING RIGHT NOW GIVEN THAT THEY WENT TO PRINT ON THURSDAY SO THEY ARE REVIEWING THOSE PROVIDING US WITH FEEDBACK. I WANT TO SAY THAT OUR MEMBERS DO THAT DEEPLY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE AND ACTUALLY JOINED TOGETHER IN THE DESIRE TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CHALLENGE. THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT OUR MEMBERS SPECIAL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE PROVIDE ESSENTIAL LOCAL SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES. THAT DEPEND ON THOSE SERVICES FOR AN AFFORDABLE WAY OF LIVING SO JUST AS ONE MUST HAVE AN AFFORDABLE. JUST PRICE ON A HOME OR RENTAL PRICE FOR A HOME. THE AMOUNT THAT ONE PAYS FOR WATER FOR WASTE WATER FOR FIRE PROTECTION FOR THESE BASIC ESSENTIAL SERVICES IS JUST AS A CENTRAL. TO AFFORDABLE LIVING AS AN AFFORDABLE PURCHASE PRICE ON A HOME AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE STANCE THAT WE COME HERE WITH AND WHY WE ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT WANTING TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT. BOTH PROVIDES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PROVIDES FOR AFFORDABLE LIVING -- AND THAT'S WHT OUR MEMBERS ARE SEEKING TO DO SO THAT LEADS US TO OUR CONCERNS WE HAVE THREE MAJOR CONCERNS -- THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REMAINING -- AND THE FIRST AND FOREMOST IS WITH REGARD TO THE NEW DEFINITIOS IN THE BILL AND PARTICULARLY THE WORD. I USE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THAT IT'S CURRENTLY DEFINED UNNECESSARILY LIMITS THE LOCAL FLEXIBILITY -- AND CREATES UNNECESSARY NEW LEGAL LIABILITY SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS BUT RATHER SOLUTION THAT PROVIDES THAT LOCAL FLEXIBILITY. IN A WAY THAT DE AGENCIES CAN MEET THEIR MISSION AND WORK WITHIN THEIR ENABLING ACT TO DO SO -- ONE EXAMPLE. OF THE TYPE OF USE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE AN AGENCY THAT WANTS. TO SELL A LAND FOR A SOLAR PROJECT WHERE BY THE AGENCY WOULD THEN ENTER INTO A POWER PURCHASE PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR THE OUTPUT. OF THAT PROJECT SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE I KNOW MISS KING WITH THE HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS -- WILL HAVE SOME OTHERS SECONDLY AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF A LOCAL AGENCY TO PARTICIPATE IN EVEN IN FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS -- AT AND SO IN IN THE WORD NEGOTIATION IS NOT DEFINED AND YOU COULD IMAGINE I CERTAINLY SENATORS -- YOU'VE BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE SOMEBODY BRINGS AN IDEA TO YOU -- THAT MIGHT BE OUTSIDE THE FRAMEWORK. OF A TRADITIONAL HEARING OR MAYBE RIGHT BE IT RIGHT HERE AT THIS HEARING I COME WITH A NEW IDEA -- MAYBE YOU'RE WE WERE LIVING SOLICITING THAT IDEA HAVE YOU JUST ENGAGED IN A NEGOTIATION -- WHY IS THAT SO CONCERNING THAT BRINGS US TO OUR THIRD CONCERN AND THAT IS? NOT ONLY THE X. WILL IT REALLY THE EXISTING LIABILITY WITHIN LAW BUT THE EXPANDED LIABILITY THIS BILL WOULD CREATE PARTICULARLY WITH THE FINE THAT IT ESTABLISHES. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THIS IS BRAND NEW A 50% FIND ON THE VALUE OF THE LAND IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE WITH THE SURPLUS LAND ACT AND WE DO APPRECIATE THERE ARE SOME. SOME SAFE HARBORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WITHIN THE WITHIN THE BILL BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT SOME OF THESE AGENCIES THEY'RE NEGOTIATING THE SALES. MIGHT BE VERY SMALL AGENCIES WE HAVE SOME THAT MIGHT HAVE A THOUSAND CUSTOMERS IN SOME INSTANCES PARTICULAR WITH THE VALUE OF LAND AS IT IS WE MIGHT HAVE AN AGENCY SELLING A PLOT OF LAND THAT MIGHT BE WORTH MORE THAN THE ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET. OF AN AGENCY AND SO A 50% FINE ON THE VALUE OF THAT LAND COULD BE DEVASTATING TO AN AGENCY. THAT'S JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO THEY SELL THIS LAND THE RIGHT WAY AND THEY CAN'T NAVIGATE A COMPLICATED SURPLUS LAND THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE A IN HOUSE ATTORNEY. IT'S ASSISTING THEM WITH THIS PURCHASE OR THE CELL SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF CONCERNS OR WORKING THROUGH -- I HOPE THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OUR OUR DESIRE TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE IN GOOD FAITH. WITH THAT I WILL -- REST MY CASE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU. IN WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ALSO ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR FOR WORKING WITH THE COALITION AND OUR OPPOSITION. HOW WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL HAS REALLY GREAT INTENTIONS BUT THERE ARE A FEW UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DOES APPLY TO OUR DISTRICTS THAT WOULD SELL HOSPITAL OR CLINIC OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY THAT HAS AN EXISTING BUILDING ON IT. MOST OF THE TIMES ARE DISTRICTS WILL SELL THOSE AT THEIR IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS WHERE THEY WILL LOOK AT LEASING AND MOST OF THOSE CASES THEY WILL START NEGOTIATING WITH HEALTH CARE ENTITIES. VERY EARLY ON WE'RE CONCERNED THAT ARE DISTRICTS WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF THIS BILL WERE TO GO FORWARD THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE INITIAL PROCESS THAT SET UP IN THE BILL BEFORE THEY CAN START TALKING TO THEIR DISTRICTS AND AS MISTER PUTNAM ALREADY MENTIONED. THE THREAT OF A LAWSUIT AND THE THREAT OF THE PENALTIES IN THE BILL ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF OUR SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS. THAT MAY ALREADY BE IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ADDITIONALLY WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE DEFINITION OF USE IN THE BILL. IT I AM DOES NOT ALLOW FOR RETAIL OR OFFICE DEVELOPMENT A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE OFF MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS WERE CONCERNED THAT. THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENGAGED BY OUR HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED PUBLIC USE AND THEREFORE THOSE LANDS THAT THE ACTIVITIES ARE -- THAT ARE OPERATED ON WITH THEM BECOME SURPLUS LAND AND SO AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SOME WORKABLE SOLUTIONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF ON SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THANK. pOTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO AB. EIGHT FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX HE GOT A VALENTINE ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THE REASONS JUST ENUMERATED BY MY TWO COLLEAGUES AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. AT THAT BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY ALSO HAS AN OPPOSED COMMENDED POSITION. A GOOD AFTERNOON JOE BOSCO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES ALSO IN OPPOSITION. PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES CESSATION AND I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED BY AQUA TO A LINER COMMENTS WITH CSTA THANK YOU.

CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. SURE THE CONCERNS OUTLINED BY CSTA BUT WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE AMENDMENT TO SECTION THIRTEEN RELATED TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT REPORTING IN FOR BETTER LIGHTING THAT. IN CHRISTY FOR WITH THREE VALLEY'S MISCIBLE WATER DISTRICT ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY THE SPECIAL DISTRICT ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY. SENATOR ROTH [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE WHOLE WORLD. SIR I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY SPECIAL DISTRICTS OF WITHIN THE SENATE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT -- WAS SOME CONCERNS -- AND I WAS TRYING. TO EXPLORE WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE. SEEMS CLEAR VIEW OF VACANT LAND AND THEN A SPECIAL DISTRICT IS GOING TO SELL IT TO SOMEBODY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER THEN THAT'S JUST CLEARLY FALLS WITHIN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WAS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE LAKE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE ONE DISTRICT SPECIAL DISTRICT AS A SANITATION DISTRICT AND THEY HAVE A COMMERCIAL BUILDING. THE THING NO LONGER OF USE FOR THEIR OFFICES BUT THEY LEASE IT TO VARIOUS NON PROFITS. SEARCHES OF HISTORICAL SOCIETY CHURCH GROUP ONE OR TWO IN THE BUILDING PROVIDES A NEEDED OFFICE SPACE FOR THESE COMMUNITY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS IS THAT USE PROHIBITED UNDER THE BILL -- FOR PERMITTED UNDER THE BILL FOR WITH THE AGENCY BE REQUIRED TO THE DISTRICT BE REQUIRED TO TERMINATE -- THAT USE AND MAKE THE PROPERTY THE BUILDING IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING AVAILABLE. TO LOW INCOME HOUSING DEVELOPERS IT'S OKAY IF I COULD. JUST TO FURTHER MY WITNESS THE BILL CLUB SELING. AFTERNOON SENATOR ROBB IS A CLEAR QUESTION YES -- AND SO TO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION -- THE QUESTION OF LEASES ACTUALLY REMAINS UNANSWERED IN THIS BILL IT WAS INITIALLY INCLUDED AND AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAINTED. INCORPORATE LANGUAGE INITIALLY TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION BUT ONE OF THE EARLY AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAD TO TAKE IN -- ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT REMOVED THOSE PROVISIONS AND CALLED FOR THE FORMATION OF A WORKING GROUP. TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THE ISSUE ON LEASES BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THERE'S DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF WHETHER OR NOT LEASES ARE COVERED EVEN UNDER EXISTING LAW -- IT HAS BEEN ALWAYS OUR INTENT TO ALLOW FOR INTERIM SHORT TERM LEASES THAT DO NOT CREATE ANY PERMANENT USE ON THE LAND TO REMAIN AT TO REMAIN UP ALLOWED -- UNDER THE LINE WOULD NOT BE INTERFERED BY THIS BUT FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IF THE LEASING ARRANGEMENT LET'S TAKE THE HOSPITAL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE WERE. YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A HOSPITAL IF YOU DON'T HAVE PHYSICIANS AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HOSPITALS TEND TO DO IS GROUP PHYSICIANS IN. MEDICAL PRACTICE GROUPS AROUND. AND IT'S YOU HAVE A LEASING ARRANGEMENT TO ALLOW -- A MEDICAL GROUP PURCHASERS OF THEM TO LEASE FACILITIES ON YOUR PROPERTY IN ORDER TO HELP STAFF YOUR HOSPITAL. THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE A A LEASING ARRANGEMENT IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE EXISTENCE AND MISSION OF THE HOSPITAL DISTRICT AND AND LEASING ARRANGEMENT AND MEDICAL GROUP OPERATIONS CENTER. ARE INTEGRAL TO THE TO THE PURPOSE AND AN OPERATION OF THE DISTRICTS OF IN THAT CASE A LEASING OPERATION. LONG TERM SHORT TERM WHATEVER WOULD SORT OF HE WON A PERMIT THAT WOULDN'T YOU. YES AND THE BILL PRESENTLY DOES ALLOW FOR THAT AS LONG AS THE AS LONG AS THE LAND. IS BEING USED TO SUPPORT THE WORK OR OPERATIONS OF THE LOCAL AGENCY THERE IS A CLEAR PROVISION THERE THAT SAYS -- IT ISN'T IT WOULD NOT TRIGGER THE PROVISIONS OF THE SURPLUS LAND OCT. WELL AND I YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THEIR CODE SECTIONS THAT DEFINED THE TERM DISPOSE BUT TO ME DISPOSE MEANS TO GET RID OF THEM THAT MAY NOT BE TRUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- CODES BUT IF YOU IF YOU ARE STILL THE THE TITLE OWNER OF THE BUILDING. YOU HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES WHAT DO YOU HAVE A TENANT IN THERE ARE NOT DE IF THERE'S ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ON THE PROPERTY MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS THE LANDOWNER. GOVERNMENT OR OTHERWISE YOU HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES FOR CLEAN UP. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF THERE IS A IF THERE'S PROPERTY DAMAGE PERSONAL INJURY ON THAT PROPERTY. AS THE LANDOWNER OF THE BUILDING. ARE YOU HAVE LIABILITY UNLESS YOU FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO SHIFT THE BURDEN TO TO THE TENANT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE SO. YOU MAY HAVE A TENANT BUT YOU REALLY NOT DISPOSE OF ANYTHING. OTHER THAN YOUR OCCUPANCY. SO I I I'M HOPING YOU'RE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. WE ARE AND THE DEFINITION OF THE SPOILS WAS ALSO ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS THAT ARE IN QUESTION AS I MENTIONED. IN THE INITIAL VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED WE DEALT WITH THAT. ISSUE HEAD ON BUT WE HAD TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT EARLY TO REMOVE REFERENCES TO LEE SAYS OTHER THAN WHAT'S UNDER EXISTING LAW. PART OF WHY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING INTRODUCED THIS BILL WAS TO CLARIFY EXACTLY WHEN THE SURPLUS LAND APPLIED AND WHEN IT DOES NOT AND SO -- THERE IS A ORKING GROUP THAT HAD THAT IS BEING CONVENE IT'S MATT ALREADY ONCE WHERE YOU WANT TO BE WILL BE RECONVENING AGAIN DURING RECESS. TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS ON LEASES BECAUSE IT IS -- THE LAW ADMITTEDLY THIS NOT AS IT IS RIGHT NOW DOES NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS SEE YOU EXPECT THIS TO BE CLEANED UP ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BEFORE WE ACTUALLY. THIS COMES TO VOTE ON THE FLOOR. YES AND THEN I ONE FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY SIR OF SO IN THIS CASE THE SPECIAL DISTRICT WITH THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. LET'S SAY THE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS A FIVE STORY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT BUILDING THAT THE SPECIAL DISTRICT NO IT'S A IT'S A WATER DISTRICT THE WATER DISTRICT IS NO LONGER USING BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE FACILITY. AND THEY THEY WANT. TO DO IN THIS CASE TRULY DISPOSE OF THE BUILDINGS THROUGH A SALE OR TRANSFER. THE MARKET VALUE THE BUILDINGS TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS LOU IS THE WATER DISTRICT ENTITLED TO EXPECT THAT MARKET VALUE. TO BE RECEIVED FROM ANY LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER YES SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE LESS THAN THE MARKET VALUE. AND I'M SORRY -- AND AND THE LAW ACTUALLY A THERE IS AN EXISTING SECTION IN THE LAW THAT SAYS -- YOU BRING SELL IT AT MARKET VALUE OR YOU MEET DISCOUNTED IT IS UP TO YOU -- AND IN FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX BE REFERENCE NOT SECTION SEVERAL TIMES TO MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR. THAT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SELL THE LAND BELOW MARKET VALUE PERFECT WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE HOPEFULLY THE REVISED VERSION WHEN IT HITS THE FLOOR AND I'LL BE HAPPY. TO MAKE THE MOTION DEEPER PETER ANSWER. THANK YOU. JUST ADD ONE THING YOU ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SELL THE LAND YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE THE FOR THE HOUSING DEVELOPERS THE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL. SO IF YOU GIVE THEM THE FIRST REFUSAL NOBODY COMES FORWARD THEN YOU CAN AGAIN SO IT TO WHOMEVER YOU WISH. WE HAVE A SENATOR CAFIERO THAT WOULD LIKE TO INTERROGATE I MEAN ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS. NOW I'M JUST TRYING. TO LET ME SAY THAT I I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE THE THE ISSUE IS REALLY VERY VERY SIMPLE WHICH IS SAID IF YOU'RE GOING. TO RELIEVE YOURSELF. OF THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY AND YOU'RE IN THEM. IN GOVERNMENT THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS I THINK THE KEY HERE GETS BACK TO WHAT. THE DEFINITION OF SURPLUS IS AND HOW YOU IDENTIFY IT IS SURPLUS SO -- I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY BECAUSE OUR OUR COMMITTEE REPORT. HAD NO DETAIL ON THE SPECIFICS AND YOU MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE. TO BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE SHOW UP AND THEY SAY HEY I'VE GOT AN IDEA FOR THAT PIECE OF PROPERTY. AND TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THAT SHOULDN'T IS IT SHOULDN'T ABOUT -- IN ORDER TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEIR SPECIAL DISTRICT OR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SO I THINK IF WE GET A REALLY GOOD DEFINITION WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU WERE GETTING TO OF WHAT IS DETERMINED TO BE SURPLUS -- THEN THAT AND IT'S A BRIGHT LINE THEN YOU YOU START TO PROTECT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR AND ARE NO LONGER OF CONCERN BECAUSE YOU'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME ACTION THAT IDENTIFIES IT AS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SELL. OR OR GET RID OF AND AND AND THEN IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE BECOMES A LITTLE BABIES YOURSELF. THAT I THINK -- I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO SEE WHAT THE DEAF AND I WAS TRYING TO FIND THE DEFINITION OF OF SURPLUS AND UNFORTUNATELY REFERS TO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE BILL AND I I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT. THAT -- AND I LOOK AT MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE AND THERE WAS THERE WERE MANY MANY YEARS WHERE WE SAT ON PROPERTY FOR YEARS AND WE SAT ON IT BECAUSE WE HAD THIS GREAT IDEA. THE ECONOMY WENT DOWN THAT THE TANK AND WE COULDN'T GET ANY FUNDING FOR IT AND SO IT STAYED THERE VACANT AND I I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE COMING AND GOING FOR AYE. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT PROPERTY AND YOU HAVEN'T USED IT IN TEN YEARS AND SO IT'S SURPLUS. AND WE GET WE GET TO INNER INTER INTO AN AGO SHE SHOULD BECAUSE I'VE DECIDED THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD JUST SELL IT RATHER THAN HAVE HABITS IN SIT EMPTY AND I THANK. YOU MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE THERE WE HAVE SOME PROPERTIES EXPECT ESPECIALLY AROUND OUR TRAIN STATION WHERE WE WE HAD A PLAN WE HAD FUNDING FROM THE STATE THE MONEY DISAPPEARED AND SO WE WE STILL HAVE VACANT LAND AND AND AND I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE ABLE TO SAY. THAT SURPLUS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT USING IT AND YOU HAVEN'T USED IT. FOR A LONG TIME FIFTEEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS SO SO AS LONG AS YOU GET THAT SURPLUS -- TRIGGER RIGHT AND THERE'S SOME ACTION IT'S REQUIRED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THAT THEN I'M I'M I'M WITH YOU BUT I'LL SUPPORT YOU TODAY AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN GET THEIR THANK YOU SAID I THINK IT THANK YOU. I THINK YOU CRYSTALLIZED EXACTLY THE ESSENCE OF THE BILL WHICH IS. WHY I DECIDE TO CARRY IT OF COURSE WHAT YOU SAID TO CARRY THE BILL YOU REALIZE IT'S A MUCH MUCH MORE COMPLEX WHICH IS WHY THERE'S ALL THE SURPLUS LAND LYING AROUND THAT? HASN'T BEEN BUILT AND NOT AND STORE NEAR AS COMPLEX AS WATER BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS NO. GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR SPECIAL DISTRICT THAT EVER THINKS THEIR LAND A SURPLUS THEY HAVE SOME VISION OF GRANDEUR. FOREVER AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THEY'VE HAD VISIONS OF GRANDEUR OF HOUSING. FOR TEACHERS. FOR DECADES I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS CAN BE A VACANT LAND GOING ON TWO THREE FOUR DECADES WILL BE COULD HAVE. ACTUALLY HAD HOUSING FOR TEACHERS ON INTO OUR OUR DEFINITION IS. AT THAT THE LAND BECOME SURPLUS WHEN THE AGENCIES DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF IT -- THE CHALLENGES YOU HAVE AGENCIES THAT NEVER EVER GO THROUGH. THAT CATALOG OF DEFINING WHAT IS SURPLUS AND WHAT IS NOT SO I THINK WHAT WE TRY TO DO. IN THE LEGISLATION IS TO IS TO TRY. TO HAVE THAT LINE AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS FOR A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS ARE AGENCIES THAT NEVER WENT THROUGH THAT DIALOGUE GETS A LITTLE BIT. CONCERNING BECAUSE THEN IT MIGHT FORCE THEIR HAND A LITTLE BIT SO I THINK WE WE ARE TRYING. TO FIND SOME MIDDLE GROUND ON WHAT THE OTHER THING IS AN AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT IN IN THE INSTANCE THAT YOU GIVE THERE MAY BE THERE MAY BE JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN USING THEIR PROPERTY. FOR FOR HOUSING FOR YOU KNOW THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE FOR AFFORDABLE OR FOR WORKFORCE -- BUT THERE MAY BE A HYBRID. TO BE ABLE TO SAY IN THE INSTANCE WHERE YOU HAVE PROPERTY THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE -- BILL WERE FOR HOUSING COULD REASONABLY BE BUILT -- THAT YOU CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THE NONPROFIT DEVELOPER FOR THE PROVISION OF HOUSING. THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY AND SO. SO YOU MAY HAVE SURPLUS IT YOU HAVE TO SELL BUT YOU ALSO MAY HAVE PROPERTY THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S WHAT WHAT I'M HOPING THE STATE WILL DO BECAUSE THERE ARE PROPERTIES. THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A REALLY LONG TIME THAT ARE IN. TIME LOCATIONS WHERE HOUSING COULD BE BUILT. AND TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE AS A PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE ANOTHER OPTION. WELL WE WE DO THAT IN MY DISTRICT WERE ACTUALLY HAD A BILL -- NOT AROUND PRIME LAND BUT THESE WERE CALTRANS LANDS TEN TEN PARCELS IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT ARE. THESE TO THE CITY UNDER MARKET -- FOR NAVIGATE FOR HOMELESS DEDICATION CENTERS OR PARKS NOW YOU DON'T YOU WOULD NOT SEE THE SURPLUS LAND BECAUSE FRANKLY THE FREEWAY ON RAMPS. SO IF YOU EVER SAW THEM YOU WOULD NEVER THINK ALL THIS TO BE A GREAT PLACE FOR A TWO HUNDRED UNIT DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A BIT. BUT YOU KNOW WE HAD. TEN ENCAMPMENTS IN THOSE AREAS TO SO WE WERE ABLE TO REPLACE THOSE TEN ENCAMPMENTS. INPUT -- TEMPERING APPLICATION SENATOR WE THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER USE BUT THE I THINK THAT'S REALLY. THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND I THINK I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION WITH THE SPECIAL USED TO STRIPPING. CHALLENGE HAS BEEN. THAT ON HIS NO NO ONE FEELS COMFORTABLE EVER GIVING ANY. PIECE OF THEIR LAND TO WHEREVER SAYING THAT. THIS IS SURPLUS SOMETHING THAT'S WHERE WERE THOSE OF THE DEFINITIONS THAT WE CONTINUE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH AND WE WILL TRY. TO GET GET THROUGH BEFORE WE GET TO THE CENTER. FOR SENATOR BATES IS NEXT FALL BY ME AND THEN WILL RETURN THIS BACK TO THE CHAIR. IF THE GAVEL EMPLOYEES. I JUST WANT TO INNER SCORE -- UNDERSCORE WHAT TO MY COLLEAGUE GOT TO ROSS SAID ABOUT THE LEASES ARE. WE FIND IN MY COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE HAVING SERVED ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT WE WERE USING A LAND. DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS THAT WOULD CREATE REVENUE TO MEET THE CORE MISSION OF THE COUNTY OF ORANGE A VERY SIGNIFICANT AS WE SEE THE PENSION LIABILITIES. GROWING EXPONENTIALLY AND THE GENERAL FUND HAVE ENOUGH COVER THOSE THERE FOR THE SERVICES THAT ARE THERE FOR A PUBLIC SAFETY PARKS RECREATION. YOU KNOW OUR TRANSPORTATION THOSE ARE STARTING TO DIMINISH SO IT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THE LEASE ISSUE BE WORKED ON BECAUSE THAT'S HOW. ARE THEY ABLE TO MONETIZE THE LAND FOR THE VERY PURPOSE THEIR OF THEIR CORE MISSION AND THEIR GOALS THE RESPONSIBILITIES ESSENTIALLY ODD. TO THE TAXPAYER SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU HAVE THAT THE WORKING GROUP BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSCORED. IT IS VITAL AND SOME OF THE COMMUNITY SAID OF MARTY DESIGNATED AND WE HAVE A HARBOR. IN -- ORANGE COUNTY THAT CENTER GOING EVITALIZATION IT'S LEASED OUT TO A GROUP THAT ARE PUTTING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN IT BUT IT WILL GENERATE REVENUE FOR THE COUNTY WANTS TO ME TO SCHOOLS. SO LOESER OF THOSE ARE CRITICAL. THANK YOU ABSOLUTE. YOU -- YOU'VE YOU'VE BUILT -- WONDERFUL LIST OF AGENCIES IN OPPOSITION. WE WOULD BE DOING IF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW. TELLING YOU. AND YOU KNEW HOW TO HIT IT -- CINNAMON TANG AND AND SO HOT. I'M. I'M STILL WAITING FOR YOU TO REACH THE SWEDES PART WITH WITH THESE IMPORTANT OR AGENCIES UC'S ASSOCIATIONS.

MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB ONE SIX EIGHT AIMS TO ENSURE THAT NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES. AND SACRED SITES WILL BE PROTECTED UNDER NEW STREAMLINED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT LAW. WE ARE SEEKING TO PROVIDE A TEMPLATE THAT CAN BE USED IN FUTURE STREAMLINING LAWS AS WELL. WE HAVE LOST MUCH OF THE STATE'S NATIVE HISTORY AND ONCE A RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL ARTIFACT SITE OR BURIAL GROUND IS LOST IT CANNOT BE REPLACED. AS A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TODAY. HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT THESE AMENDMENTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRIBES. AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED MISTER CHAIR I ASK FOR YOUR COMMITMENT THAT WE WORK WITH TRIBAL ATTORNEYS LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND COMMITTEE STAFF UNTIL. CALIFORNIA'S TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AGREE THAT WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT CAN TRUTH THAT TRULY PROTECTS TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES. THAT EFFORT FAILS OVER THE INTERIM WE WILL STAND DOWN AND COME BACK NEXT YEAR. WE'LL RETURN IN UNTIL WE TRULY HAVE PROTECTED THE CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS PLACES AND ARTIFACTS OF CALIFORNIA'S SOVEREIGN TRIBAL NATIONS. TRIBES MUST HAVE ASSURANCES ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS LANGUAGE AND THEY NEED A GUARANTEE THE TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES WILL GET THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT THEY CURRENTLY RECEIVE UNDER AB. FIFTY TWO WITH CONSULTATION TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCES CAN BE PROTECTED OR AVOIDED AND IMPACTS CAN BE MITIGATED. DEVELOPMENT CAN ACTUALLY MOVE FASTER WITH CONSULTATION BECAUSE LITIGATION IS LESS NECESSARY AS A MEANS OF PROTECTION FOR TRIBES. MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW WE SHARE THE SAME GOAL AS THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO PRESERVE THE ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH LOCAL PROJECT PROPONENTS AND GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT TRIBAL RIGHT.

ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CHALLENGES PEOPLE FACE TO SECURING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OFTEN INDIVIDUALS CAN MEET THE MONTHLY FRONT IS A BARRIER. THE RISING DEMAND FOR MORE HOUSING IS COUPLE WITH THE NEED TO MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE. WE KNOW THAT RENDON CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY CHECK ALREADY CHALLENGES ARE TO THE DEFINITION OF AFFORDABLE. THE BURDEN OF HIGH RANK COUPLED WITH THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDEN ANOTHER NECESSARY COST OF LIVING. LEAVES LITTLE AVAIL INCOME FOR MANY TO AFFORD THE INITIAL-MOVING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SECURING HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. LIVING COSTS SUCH AS SECURITY DEPOSITS AND FIRST MONTH'S RENT SAYS HE WAS SECURING RENTAL HOUSING CAN COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. AND THAT AND EIGHT AND THAT AN INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO HAVE ON HAND WHICH IS UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. HE BEFORE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM THAT COULD PROVIDE THAT MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE TO COVER THESE MOVING COSTS INCREASE IN INCREASE HOUSING SECURITY AND REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. HERE IN SUPPORT WITH ME TODAY IS LUIS MARATHI. FROM CALIFORNIA U. M. B. AND THAT'S WITH A WHY.

ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND WHILE THE STATE FOCUS IS IMPORTANT ATTENTION ON BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA'S INCREASINGLY LARGE RENTER COMMUNITY I NEED HELP NOW.

MORE THAN A QUARTER OF RENTER HOUSEHOLDS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE OLDER ADULT OUTSOLD. THE NUMBER OF UNITS RENTING FOR LESS THAN EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH HAS FALLEN EVERY YEAR SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN WHICH IS A NET DECLINE OF FOUR MILLION UNITS MAKING MATTERS WORSE. ACCORDING TO THE JOINT CENTER FOR HOUSING STUDIES TABULATIONS AFFORDABILITY RESTRICTIONS COULD EXPIRE ON APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT TWO MILLION RENTAL UNITS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. NATION WIDE THAT INCLUDES SIX HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND UNITS THAT ARE ADDED THROUGH THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM.

IT IT PROPOSES TO CREATE INVENTORY OF ON YOU CITY AND COUNTY PROPERTY -- FOR THE POTENTIAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WHILE LEAVING PAUL LEAVING THESE DECISIONS ON USED TO LOCAL CONTROL AND SO BY SIMPLY IDENTIFYING THESE OVERLOOKED IN UNDERDEVELOPED AREAS. THERE'S TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR LOCAL LEADERS AND DEVELOPERS TO COLLABORATE AND TO BUILD SMART AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND DANCE. TRANSIT RICH AREAS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF OF THOSE COMMUNITIES OF OF OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO THIS BILL IS NARROW IN SCOPE AND IDENTIFIES ONLY SITES THAT QUALIFIES IN FOR HIGH DENSITY.

MISTER CHAIR AND AND AND COLLEAGUES IS STAFF I APPRECIATE THE BILL ANALYSIS -- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THIS AFTERNOON. TO PRESENT THIS BILLS I'M VERY VERY PROUD -- TO TALK ABOUT THIS NEXT BILL WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY EIGHT THREE IT'S A BILL. OF IT'S A A PRIORITY BILL THE LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. IT IS A PRIORITY FOR THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I REPRESENT. AND IT CERTAINLY IS A PRIORITY FOR THE OVER NINETY THOUSAND FARMWORKERS -- IN IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT. AND SO -- IN ADDRESSING OUR STATE'S ACUTE HOUSING SHORTAGE. IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED A BROAD AND DIVERSE APPROACH. HELLO AND TO FULLY ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. WE MUST ALSO. ALSO LOOK BEYOND OUR LARGEST CITIES AND URBAN CENTRES. BECAUSE WE TWO NEED HOUSING POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS FOR RURAL AND AGRICULTURAL REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD IN ADDRESSING OUR FARM WORKER HOUSING SHORTAGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FARMWORKERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. TOGETHER WITH OUR FAMILY FARMERS THEY WORK TO BRING THE FRESHEST PRODUCE TO MARKET. AND THEY CERTAINLY DO THEIRPART IN HELPING FEED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. YET THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE AND DECENT PLACES FOR THEM TO LIVE [inaudible] SUMMER HOMELESS. OTHERS PAY RENT. AND THAT RENT EATS UP THE MAJORITY OF THEIR FAMILIES PAY. AND THERE HOUSING. THEIR LIVING SITUATION IS DEPLORABLE. AND OFTEN SUB STANDARD. WE HAVE FARMWORKERS LIVING IN GARAGES [inaudible] INTENSE. IN THE BANDS. AND ABANDONED BUILDINGS. WE HAVE A MULTIPLE FAMILIES LIVING IN THE SAME ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. IN FACT JUST LAST YEAR. IN AN ARTICLE FEATURED -- THAT THAT THAT THAT HIGHLIGHTED THIS FARMER HOUSING CRISIS IN THE SALINAS VALLEY. IT HIGHLIGHTED ONE CASE OR FORTY PEOPLE FORTY PEOPLE WERE LIVING IN A THREE BEDROOM HOME. THAT HAD JUST TWO BATHROOMS. THERE ARE FARMWORKERS LIVING IN TRAILERS AND TRAILERS WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING DURING THE HOT SUMMER MONTHS. AND THESE AREN'T JUST FILLED WORKERS WERE TALKING ABOUT. BUT AS THEIR CHILDREN. IT IS THEIR FAMILIES. IN RURAL MONTEREY COUNTY IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT ONE IN TEN STUDENTS. ARE HOMELESS. AT TWELVE SCHOOLS THAT NUMBER IS ONE IN. FIVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE KIDS ARE THE CHILDREN OF FARMWORKERS. IN THIS SITUATION. THIS SITUATION IS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS RIGHT HERE IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. AND I INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT. THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SOMETHING. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE AN OPT IN PROGRAM. OPT IN VOLUNTARY. A PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BY WHICH DECENT QUALITY FARM WORKER HOUSING GETS A BILL. THE DOES NOT ADD ADDITIONAL RED TAPE FOR FARMERS. IS THAT HELPS MAKE IT EASIER. EASIER FOR FARMERS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO BUILD DIGNIFIED FAMILY FRIENDLY. FAMILY FRIENDLY HOUSING. HOUSING FOR THE WORKERS TO KEEP IS FED AND HELP DRIVE OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES. AND CERTAINLY OUR STATE ECONOMY. NOW THIS BILL ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY THREE IS IT A SILVER BULLET WITH REGARDS TO FORMER HOUSING. THERE IS MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. BUT IS IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND AS MANY OF YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW. I CAN SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE I CAN SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FORMER HALF OF FORMER HOUSING FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE YOU SEE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FARMWORKERS ALMADEN VINEYARDS AND PISCINE THIS CALIFORNIA. HE WITH MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY MOM WAS A SINGLE PARENT. THEY RAISED MY BROTHER AND I SO I GREW UP IN FORMER HOUSING. TEN MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY AND I LIVED IN OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS. OUR FORMER HOUSING UNIT WAS LOCATED ON THE SAME AGRICULTURAL FILLED THE SAME VINEYARDS WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WORKED EVERY SINGLE DAY. OUR HOUSING WAS VERY VERY BASIC BUT IT WAS DECENT. DECENT HOUSING THAT ROOF OVER OUR HEADS. GAVE OUR FAMILY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER LIFE. BUT MANY FAMILY MANY FARMWORKERS THEN AND TODAY ARE NOT SO LUCKY. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY EACH AND EVERYONE OF US IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. TO SURE THAT THE DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. REMAINS OPEN FOR EVERYONE. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY EIGHTY THREE WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO WORK THE FIELDS LIKE MY GRANDFATHER DID. AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR CURRENT GENERATION FARMWORKERS. THAT THEIR CHILDREN ALSO HAVE THE CHANCE AT A BETTER LIFE AND AT A BRIGHTER FUTURE. AND THIS BILL IS THE FIRST STEP IS A BUILDING BLOCK A BUILDING BLOCK TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE GREAT NEED. THE BILL FARMER HOUSING IN OUR STATE AND TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS IN EVERY. AREA OF THE STATE. EVERY COMMUNITY NOT JUST WEALTHY ZIP CODES HAVE ACCESS TO HOUSING. THIS ON BEHALF OF MY CO AUTHORS I CERTAINLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- IN AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND WITH THAT -- WE DO HAVE BILL SPONSORS HERE. WHO CAN -- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND I WOULD ASK THAT THEY INTRODUCE THEMSELVES THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU. WITH OVER THREE THREE WITNESSES. AB SO HAPPY WITH I WE WOULD ASK EACH TO BE APPROXIMATELY TWO MINUTES OR SO THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M THAT IS SEVERAL MEADOW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. THE FIRST QUESTION SHOULD THE STATE BILL MORE FARM WORKER HOUSING. AND DO SO FASTER. I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WHO WATER FOR EACH OF YOU WOULD VOTE YES. CALIFORNIA IS BEGINNING TO BILL MORE HOUSING BUT AS USUAL FARMWORKERS ARE LAST IN LINE. THESE WILL WOULD SPEED UP THE LINE FOR DECENT QUALITY FARM WORKER FAMILY HOUSING. THE SECOND QUESTION SHOULD STAY TAXPAYERS PAY FOR OUR TO BILL HOUSING. FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S EXPANDED GETS WORK PROGRAM. YOU KNOW HOW THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR YOU WOULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION. STATE TAXPAYERS DO NOT WANT THEIR MONEY TO SPEND TO BE SPENT ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S GIVES WORKER PROGRAM. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WITH NO HOUSING AT ALL. FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE H. TO A PROGRAM. IT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO HARNESS THE WORKER FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. TO THEM SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OF THE WORK FORCE. THIS IS MY THIRD MARTYR DANE INDENTURED SERVITUDE. ENTITIES ARE RAGES. WE WOULD. IT IS OUR BRIDGES WE WOULD DONATE. STATE PET TAXPAYER MONEY TO CONTINUE THIS. THIS BILL DOESN'T BLOCK ANY FARMER OR DEVELOPER TO BUILD WHAT THE FROM ONE TO FACILITATE THE TRUMP PROGRAM. AS LONG AS THEY SPEND THEIR OWN MONEY. NOT OURS. THE PEOPLE WATER FOR YOU WOULD VOTE YES IN THIS BILL. I JOIN THEM IN ASKING THEM. AND ASKING YOU TO AVOID YESTERDAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR RAN LOPEZ FROM THE CENTER FOR OF FARMWORKER FAMILIES. I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING AND WORKING WITH FARMWORKERS FOR ABOUT TWENTY TWO YEARS. AND I VISITED MANY OF THEM IN THEIR PLACES OF RESIDENCE. AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M APPALLED AT THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF THIS HIDDEN MOSTLY UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION. ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHOULD COST THE FARM WORKERS THAT I KNOW PAY UP 280% OF THEIR IMPOVERISHED WAGES. ON RENT AND OFTEN HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING RENT AND PROVIDING SHELTER FOR THEIR FAMILIES OR BUYING FOOD. A FEW FARMWORKER FAMILIES FIND DECENT HOUSING IN THE STATE'S SEASONAL MIGRANT CAMPS OR IN THE MID PENINSULA HOUSING AUTHORITY APARTMENTS. HOWEVER BOTH OF THESE OPTIONS HAVE DRAWBACKS INCLUDING IN THE MIGRANT CAMPS FAMILIES HAVE TO MOVE AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR. AND IN THE IN THE MID PAN SITUATION THERE IS A WAITING LIST OF FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS FOR AN APARTMENT. MORE COMMON -- FARMWORKERS IN YEAR ROUND RESIDENTS IN WATSONVILLE CASTROVILLE IN SALINAS AND THE WAY THEY LIVE IS DISGRACEFUL AND A CAUSE FOR CONCERN. EXAMPLES SIXTEEN PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN LIVING IN LESS THAN A THOUSAND SQUARE FEET WITH ONE BATHROOM. AND THEY TELL ME THEY HAVE TO LINE UP IN THE MORNING TO USE THE BATHROOM. TO FARM WORKER MEN RENTED A GARAGE WITH THE SCENT OF CEMENT FLOOR IN WINTER FOR ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEY WERE COLD SO THEY ATTEMPTED THE HEAT THE GARAGE WITH A SMALL BARBEQUE. BOTH PERISHED IN THE NIGHT FROM CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING AND THERE WERE NO OBITUARIES IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS ABOUT THEIR PASSING. A SINGLE MOTHER FARM WORKER PAYS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH SHE WORKS SIX DAYS A WEEK TEN TEN HOURS A DAY. TO RENT A DILAPIDATED UNMAINTAINED HOUSE LACKING ANY SOURCE OF HEAT AND SHE BROUGHT HER INFANT HALL SON HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL IN FEBRUARY TWO A A HOUSE. IT WITH FREEZING TEMPERATURES. ALL RENTED APARTMENTS AND HOUSES I'VE EVER VISITED HAVE NOT BEEN MAINTAINED. WHEN THE STOVER REFRIGERATOR GOES OUT IT IS NOT REPLACED? OUR ORGANIZATION IS PURCHASE STOVES AND REFRIGERATORS FOR MANY FAMILIES WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT THEM SINCE THE PROPERTY OWNERS REFUSED TO REPLACE THESE. ESSENTIAL APPLIANCES THESE EXAMPLES ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT UNCOMMON THEY ARE HOWEVER. COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE AND UNACCEPTABLE AND CERTAINLY NOT REFLECTIVE OF A MORAL CIVILIZED SOCIETY AND THEY LARGELY ACCOUNT FOR FARMWORKERS LIMITED LIFE EXPECTANCY. OF ONLY FORTY NINE YEARS THAT'S THE AVERAGE. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THAT FARMWORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURAL. SYSTEM AND INDIRECTLY SUPPLY FOOD TO THE NATION AND EVEN WITH THE EXPORT TO THE WORLD. THE INDUSTRY IT IN PART ACCOUNTS FOR CALIFORNIA BEING THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. I IMPLORE YOU TO SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE PERVASIVE SUFFERING AND ANGUISH I OBSERVED DAY AFTER DAY IN FARM WORKER COMMUNITIES OVER THE YEARS DUE TO THEIR HORRIFIC HOUSING SITUATIONS. MUST BE CORRECTED WE AS A STATE AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

I'M HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ENTER YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU. WROTE MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PARK SHOCKED OR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN STRONG SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON SASHA EARNED HIM WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN STRONG SUPPORT. KIANA VALENTINE ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. LAURA JOHNSON THE BAT ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SALINAS IN SUPPORT. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION OF SO PLEASE COME FORWARD GOOD AFTERNOON MR TERM MEMBERS TAYLOR RUSH WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU AND BEHALF. OF MULTIPLE COUNTY FARM BUREAU'S WHERE REGRETTABLY OPPOSED AB -- SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WE SHARE THE INTEREST IN THE NEED TO OFFER AFFORDABLE SAFE AND HEALTHY HOUSING. FOR OUR WORK FORCE AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE OTHERS ATTENTION TO FORMER HOUSING -- A SUBSET THAT OFTEN GETS LOST IN A LARGER DISCUSSION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING GENERALLY -- WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AND ITS PRACTICALITY. A PRIMARILY WE HAVE A CONCERN WITH THE PROVISION THE BILL WHICH PRECLUDES THE UTILIZATION OF STATE FUNDING. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGE TO A EMPLOYEE HOUSING. WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S PUDENT TO USE A LEGISLATION AS AN INDICTMENT ON THE PROGRAM WE WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT PERFECT AND AND FARM BUREAU WORKS ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. DESIGN ADVOCATE FOR ITS IMPROVEMENT IN ITS APPLICATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- IN THE INTERIM HOWEVER BECAUSE OF OUR LABOR SHORTAGES THE STATE'S H. TO A POPULATION WILL CONTINUE TO GROW SO RESTRICTING OR LIMITING THE UTILIZATION OF EXISTING FUNDS. AND FUTURE FUNDS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MEET THAT POPULATIONS NEEDS -- WILL ACTUALLY DISCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING AND EXACERBATE OUR EXISTING SHORTAGE -- ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCENTIVE OFFERED WITHIN THE BILL -- THE WE CAN APPRECIATE DODD MYSTERY OF US IN THE SPONSORS ARE INTERESTED IN TRYING TO OFFER A TOOL -- THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE IMPOSED WITH THE UTILIZATION OF THE TOOL REALLY MAKE IT UNTENABLE FOR FARMERS TO ENGAGE -- UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF THE BILL A FARMER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING AND CONSTRUCTING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. AND THEN SEATING ALL MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT TO A THIRD PARTY FOR TERM AT FIFTY FIVE YEARS -- THE LANDHOLDERS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM HAVING ANY ROLE IN THAT HOUSING OPERATION -- BUT HOLDS ALL OF THE OLD SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THAT. SO WE HAVE SOME REAL QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT -- THAT'S FEASIBLE WHAT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN AND SERVICE THAT INTERIM PARTY -- AND ALSO ABOUT WHETHER AUDIT PROVIDES OUR FARMERS THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE KNOW WE NEED NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO NEED TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT. LABOR SOURCES -- EVEN IF ALL OF THESE CONCERNS WERE MANAGED THERE'S THERE'S OTHER ISSUES WITHOUT THAT INCENTIVE THAT JUST REALLY DON'T MAKE AN ACCESSIBLE TOOL. FOR FARMING COMMUNITIES AND ONCE AGAIN WHAT WE CAN APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S ATTENTION TO BE PAID WE THINK THAT THIS THIS INCENTIVE DANGLE THE CARROT THAT THAT'S BEYOND OUR GRASP. AND WE HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS FOR A FORMER COMMUNITIES AND WE NEED WE NEED SERIES SOLUTIONS -- NO WE WANT TO SEE TO THAT THAT WE SHARE THAT SADNESS THAT IT HAPPENS WITH FARM WORKER EMPLOYEES. THAT ARE RESIDING INTENSE AND LIVING UNDER OVERPASSES THAT CERTAINLY NOT ANYTHING THAT ARE WE'D BE HAPPY WITH OUR EMPLOYEES ENGAGING IN -- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THAT THAT'S NOT NGUYEN EMPLOYEE PROVIDE EMPLOYERS PROVIDE THAT HOUSING THAT'S IN THE ABSENCE OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED HOUSING. SO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE AS MUCH SIMPLER PROVIDING HOUSING AS POSSIBLE TO ASSIST WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HADN'T HOUSING NEED -- SO UNFORTUNATELY BASED ON THESE CONDITIONS WE JUST CAN'T FIND. THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THIS BILL. FORWARD AS A PRODUCTIVE RESPONSE TO OUR EXISTING NEED AMBER QUESTION ABOUT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MATTHEW ON WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION -- I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE FARM GRL. YOU KNOW IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE FIND OURSELVES HERE -- TODAY -- OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- AGAIN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYEE PROVIDED HOUSING WE'RE NOT ARGUING ABOUT THE ZONING ISSUE. OR FRANKLY EVEN THE CAPITAL PUT THAT HOUSING AND WE HAVE -- MEMBERS WHO WANT TO ACTUALLY GET MORE FARMER HOUSING IN BUT THEIR HANDS ARE BEING TIED -- BY CONDITIONAL USE FROM ANY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AND WE WOULD BE UP SUPPORT OF A BILL THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWED US TO GO THROUGH A MINISTERIAL PERMIT. THROUGH EIGHT CD THE DIN ALSO TIRE HANDS ON THIS OTHER SIDE JUST BY SAYING YOU'VE GOT TO TURN THE KEYS OVER TO A THIRD PARTY OPERATOR FOR FIFTY FIVE YEAR CONTRACT. IN ORDER TO THEY'LL YOURSELVES OF A FASTER PERMIT WE FIND THAT COMPLETELY UNTENABLE AND FRANKLY QUITE AND REASONABLE -- THE AGE TO A PROGRAM -- TO CORRECT THE RECORD WAS ESTABLISHED BACK IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT'S A PROGRAM -- THAT ALLOWS FOR OUR INDUSTRY -- TO BASICALLY PETITION FOR AN APPLICATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TO DEMONSTRATE AND SHOW THAT WE HAVE A LACK OF LABOR AND AG. AND OUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE APPLICATION PROCESS WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THAT WE CANNOT FIND ANY ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES. PART OF THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE HIGHER NEEDS TO EMPLOYEE IS THAT THE EMPLOYER AGREED TO PROVIDE HOUSING. WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUCH AN RULE AREAS WERE AT IS LOCATED -- TO TO MEET THAT NEED AND SO WHAT IS ALSO HAPPENING IS ADDITIONAL PRESSURES BEING UPON UPON LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- ON APARTMENT COMPLEXES RENTAL HOMES THAT FROM LABOR CONTRACTORS AND OTHERS INDUSRY HAVE TO ACTUALLY FIND HOUSING. FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES. WE ARE ASKING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOUSING ALL ON OUR LAND ON AG ZONED PROPERTY. ITS EMPLOYEE. HOUSING PROVIDED BY THE EMPLOYER NOT A GENERAL HOUSING REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE FIND THIS BILL UNTENABLE FOR US AND WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. VALERIE NARRA FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED. MORE NO AND HEY JACK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HAVE FAR COMMISSION CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSING -- AND CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRY COMMISSION UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS STATED BY FARM BUREAU WESTERN GROWERS THANK YOU. IN THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF THE PEAR GROWERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. JOHN KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF RC RC THE WORLD COUNTIES WE'RE NOT IN OPPOSITION BUT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AND I'LL BE EXTREMELY BRIEF -- FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO A TO A PROVISIONS AND THE BILL OUR CONCERNS ARE WITH THE STREAMLINED RG SERIAL PERMIT REVIEW PROCESS NAME NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. OR HAVE A LETTER THAT YOU SUBMITTED OR ONE ESTIMATE PLEASE DO SO YES WE HAVE SUBMITTED THE LETTER TO YOUR COMMITTEE TO THE AUTHOR AND WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH THEM OKAY WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. OKAY SITTING NINE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- SENATOR ROSS FALLS OVER CENTER WERE KELSEY. YOU KNOW WE CLEARLY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE IT'S AS A SERIOUS ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE THE WORKERS. BURGER CULTURE WORKERS. IN THE STATE BUT I HAVE TO SAY I'M PUZZLED BY THIS AGE TO A ISSUE AND THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF STATE HOUSING FUNDS. FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING IS AS THE GENTLEMAN NOTED THIS PROGRAM. HAS BEEN AROUND LONG BEFORE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION WASHINGTON DC. AND AND GIVEN THE HOUSE SIR GIVEN THE HOUSING CONDITIONS THAT YOU OUTLINED IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT IN THE SURGEON. H. TO A WORKERS WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A CERTIFICATION PROCESS. AND THE APPARENT SHORTAGE OF DECENT HOUSING. IN THESE AREAS WHERE THE WORKERS ARE EMPLOYED I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. WHY WE'RE GOING TO YOU'RE ASKING US TO PROHIBITIVE SO STATE FUNDS -- FOR HOUSING THESE. H. TO A WORKERS APPROPRIATELY NOW I REALIZE IT'S THE EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATION IN THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM TO PROVIDE HOUSING BUT AND I GET THAT. BUT IF THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS WHY WOULDN'T WE AND THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH HOUSING WHY WOULDN'T WE USE. STATE FUNDS TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE UNDER WHATEVER CONDITIONS. OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDES. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOUSING IS THE BEST HOUSING THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY PROVIDE. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS UNDER THIS DOME. RECOGNIZING IN DEALING WITH OUR OBLIGATION TO CARE FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THIS STATE. REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE WHERE THEY CAME FROM. WHAT THEIR STATUS IS? AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A MOVE. AWAY FROM THAT FRANKLY SO HAVEN'T HAVING -- GIVEN MY SPEECH I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THIS IT WAS THIS A POLITICAL. ISSUE HERE OR ARE WE DOING THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A CONCERN FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF OVER THE AVAILABILITY OF STATE FUNDS TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND IF SO. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE LATTER IS THE CASE. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED RESTRICTIONS ARE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER -- ELEMENTS -- TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS WITH RESPECT TO PROVIDING FUNDING FOR H. TO A HOUSING IS A CLEAR QUESTION. YES I YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S QUICK QUESTION I DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I THINK YOU KNOW -- ALL AT THE SPONSORS WEIGH IN AS WELL AFTER I'M DONE BUT YOU KNOW -- SO THIS BILL ATTEMPTS BILL FARMER FAMILY HOUSING. H. TWO WAYS A NON FAMILY ORIENTED PROGRAM THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. AND SO THIS BILL HAVE TO PROHIBIT. RIGHT USES STATE FUNDING AN H. AND SO AND SO RIGHT AND SO WITH THAT OBJECT AND I'LL GET TO THAT PART OF THE QUESTION IS A CERTAINLY THIS IS A BILL. THAT WAS BASED ON DATA LOCAL DATA AND SO I POINT TO A A LET ME WE WE GOT MOST OF THE DATA FROM THIS FARM WORKER HOUSING STUDY AN ACTION PLAN FOR THE SALINAS VALLEY IN THE POWER VALLEY. WHICH IS PUBLISHED IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND IN THAT STUDY IDENTIFIES THAT THOSE OVER NINETY THOUSAND FARMWORKERS CURRENTLY LIVING IN THIS. IN THIS. LABOR SHED. AND PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE ALTHOUGH FREQUENTLY THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON PROVIDE HOUSING FOR TEMPORARY FARMWORKERS. THE DATA IS CLEAR THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEEDS FOR PERMANENT FARM WORKER FAMILY HOUSING. THAT'S WHY THIS BILL ATTEMPTS. TO EMPHASIZE THAT NEED AND SO TO GET TO YOU KNOW CLEARLY AGE TO A IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM. THAT WE AS A STATE LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT CONTROL -- BUT YOU KNOW AND WE CAN'T TELL SOMEONE OF AN ACT OPERATE OR GROW OR WHETHER THE WE KNOW WHETHER AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN USE THAT NO THIS TEMPORARY WORKER PROGRAM AND THIS BILL LEAVES THAT DECISION FULLY UP TO THE GROWER. FULLY UP TO THE GROW. IN THIS DAY THESE ARE MY FIRST FEW MONTHS HERE SACRAMENTO WE JUST WANT TO THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IT'S THROUGH THAT BUDGET PROCESS THAT I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT HOW OUR STATE SPENDS OUR MONEY. IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES. AND SO CERTAINLY. WE DO HAVE A CHOICE AS A STATE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO SUBSIDIZE -- THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM AND SO I SAY THAT BECAUSE THIS BILL. FOCUSES ON OUR STATE FUNDING ARE LIMITED STATE FUNDING TO THE JOE SRNA FIND. ON HOUSING THAT COULD HELP FARM WORKING FAMILIES AN H. TWO A. INHERENTLY DOES NOT. IS NOT A FARM WORKER FAMILY PROGRAM. AND SO THIS BILL IS IS IS NOT ONLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES MY PERSONAL VALUES. BUT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE VISION. OF OF STATE PROGRAMS IN THE SPACE IN IN NAMELY AS I MENTION THE JOE SORT OF FIND IS A PROGRAM THAT CLEAR IF YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE JOKES IN A PROGRAM UNDER UNDER CALIFORNIA CODE IT REFERENCES A FAMILIES. THAT THIS THESE ARE FUNDS INTENDED TO BE FOR AGRICULTURE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO THE COMMUNITY BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM ALSO IN THE STATE IS DESIGNED TO HELP ALLEVIATE POVERTY NOT PROVIDE CORPORATE SUBSIDIES. SPECIALLY FOR AGRICULTURE FOR BIG HACK. AND SO A YOU KNOW AGAIN IT WE AS A STATE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER GROWERS ON THEIR DECISION TO USE OR NOT USE THIS PROGRAM H. AWAY. SOMEWHERE USES SO IF YOU IF YOU WERE WHEN FACED WITH. LESS THAN SATISFACTORY HOUSING FOR WORKERS WHO IMPORT EMPLOYED IN H. TO A PROGRAM THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT WELL OF COURSE THE POINT WHERE YOU PROHIBIT THE USE OF HOUSING FUNDS. TO CONSTRUCT HOUSING FOR THE H. TO A WORKERS. SO WHAT WAS WHAT HAS BEEN CONVEYED TO ME I HAVE WE HAVE MYSELF MY STAFF WE HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH AGRICULTURE ON THIS ISSUE. THE MESSAGE THAT HAS BEEN TOLD TO US REPEATEDLY. IS THAT THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT WHEN IT COMES TO AGE TO A PROJECTS. THAT THEY ARE MOST INTERESTED IN STREAMLINING. THE CONSTRUCTION I HAVE EXAMPLE I CAN POINT TO EXAMPLES WHERE YOU HAVE AG COMPANIES THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER. TO BUILD STATE OF THE ART. STATE THE ART. YOU KNOW HOUSING PROJECTS RACEWAY WORKERS IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN THE SALINAS VALLEY. UNFORTUNATELY THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE -- BUT CERTAINLY THE FOCUS AGAIN HERE LOOKING AT JOE CERTAIN OF THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT JOE SORT OF FIND HAS -- THE INTENTION FOR ME THE INTENTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN [inaudible] THAT. AGAIN WE CAN'T CONTROL WHAT A GROWERS GONNA DO WHETHER THEY OPT INTO AGE TO OR NOT -- BUT FOR ME IT'S IT'S THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECT AND FOCUS OUR LIMITED STATE RESOURCES ON HOUSING THAT WILL WILL RESULT IN PROJECTS TO PROVIDE DIGNIFIED HOUSING FOR FARMWORKERS FAMILIES USERS IS THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE CERNER FROM SORT OF FUN IS INADEQUATE. TO TO COVER THE FAMILY HOUSING NEED THAT YOU WERE INTERESTED IN AND PROVIDE SOME. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING FOR EACH TO A WORKERS THAT I CANNOT ANSWER -- BUT I WHAT WHAT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT WITH THE LIMITED DOLLARS THAT GOING TO JOE SORT OF FIND THE FOCUS YOU KNOW OUR EFFORT THE FOCUS IS TO DIRECT THOSE FUNDS. AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONSTRUCTED IN DEVELOPING SUPPORTING EXISTING FARMWORKER FAMILIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING AS A STABILIZING FORCE FOR ALL EMPLOYMENT AND CERTAINLY THIS IT WILL BE A STABILIZING FORCE FOR AGRICULTURE. WELL. I'M OBVIOUSLY -- SUPPORTIVE COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE OF PROVIDING WHATEVER MONEY IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE FAMILY HOUSING FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. THE BEST WE CAN POSSIBLY AFFORD. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS. THE POTENTIAL FOR LESS THAN SATISFACTORY HOUSING FOR WORKERS WHO ARE WORKING IN EMPLOYED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDER PROGRAM THAT WE DON'T CONTROL WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER HOW MANY ARE HERE. AND HOW MANY ARE WORKING YET THEY'RE HERE. AND IT IS OUR JOB AS LEGISLATORS TO PROVIDE FOR THOSE AS I SAID BEFORE IN MY OPINION. WHO LIVE AND WORK HERE? REGARDLESS OF STATUS WHO THEY ARE WHERE THEY CAME FROM. SO -- MISTER CHAIR WHILE I HAVE SOME OF IS VERY VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A CLOSE VOTE I WILL BE SUPPORTING AS A COURTESY OF THIS BILL TODAY TO MOVE IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT SOMEONE ADDRESSES MY CONCERNS BEFORE IT GETS TO THE SENATE [inaudible] FOR QUESTION CENTER. A CENTER LIKE HEALTHY. NICE TO HEAR FROM THE FORMER. CHAIR OF SUB -- TO FOUR IN THE SENATE THE DEALS WITH BUDGETING FOR HOUSING I SIT IS THE CHAIR OF SUB TO WHICH HAS RESOURCES SO MY QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO GO TO YOUR CRITERIA THAT YOU'VE SET OUT. IN IN OUR STAFF REPORTS ON PAGE THREE ONE OF THE MISSIONS THAT I SEE WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT WETLANDS AND COASTAL ZONES. THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD LET ME BE VERY PARTICULAR I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE THIS HOUSING AND HOOK HOOK UPS TO FEELING WATER SYSTEMS OR GROUND WATER A WELL. THAT THAT MAY BE A WELL INTENDED. AGRICULTURAL HOUSING THAT MAY EXACERBATE THE GROUNDWATER TRONG OR MAY ACTUALLY BE TIED UP TO A SYSTEM THAT'S THAT'S FEELING. SO THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT REQUIRES THE HOOK UP OF THESE THESE NEW UNITS TO SUCCEEDING. OUR SYSTEM NO PROOF NONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT STARES AT THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME. TO THE COMMENT SO ALL THE FOR TO ARE. OUR SPONSOR FOR THE TECHNICAL QUESTION [inaudible] THANK YOU -- THAT THAT IS ADDRESSED IN THE BILL -- SECTION SEVENTEEN OH TWO ONE BE ONE AND TWO PROVIDES THE CITY YOUR CAT HAVE HAVEN'T TEAM -- TWO ONE BE. ONE INTO. THOSE PROVISIONS PROVIDE THE CITY OR COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT MAY DENY A REQUEST FOR OPERATION CONSTRUCTION OR REPAIR OF WATER SYSTEM OR WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEM SERVICING AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEE HOUSING. BASED ON PROCEDURAL OR SUBSTANTIVE DEFECTS IN THE APPLICATION. IF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT DENIES THE APPLICATION -- BASED ON WATER CONCERNS THE APPLICANT CAN REQUEST EACH CD REVIEW THAT DENIAL AND EIGHT CD HAS THE RIGHT TO OVERRIDE IT. IF AND THIS IS A QUOTE FROM THE STATUTE. THE PLANS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ALL UP OF COOL BUILDING CODES AND HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THROUGH EIGHTY THREE AS PROVIDED PROVIDES BOTH A LOCAL CHECK IN A STATE DOUBLE CHECK. TO ENSURE THAT FORMER HOUSING PROJECTS BUILD PURSUANT TO THE BILL WILL RESULT WILL NOT RESULT IN WATER RELATED ISSUES. INCLUDING WELL WATER YES. OKAY -- MY NEXT QUESTION IS ON THE FIFTY FIVE YEAR PROVISION. WITH THE CHANGING FACE OF AGRICULTURE. YOU ELIMINATE THE H. TWO INDIVIDUALS YOU ELIMINATE. LOW INCOME WORKERS FROM LIVING IN THIS HOUSING IF. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE AGRICULTURE TRAINS CAN LOOK LIKE BUT WHAT MECHANIZATION IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY FIVE YEARS FOR A JURISDICTION TO BE COMPLETELY PLANTED WITH. WITH CROPS THAT NO LONGER HAVE THE INTENSE. FARMWORKERS. NEEDS THAT I GREW UP WITH. AND THIS WOULD PROHIBIT AT LEAST THE WAY I READ IT WOULD PROHIBIT ANYBODY ELSE FROM LIVING IN THAT LOW INCOME HOUSING. JUST PUTTING THE ISSUE AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S YOUR INTENTION THAT IT'S ONLY GONNA BE THESE PEOPLE WHO THIS IS THE BUT THERE WILL BE THERE MAY BE OTHER FAMILIES THAT AREN'T. CONNECTED WITH AGRICULTURE IN WITHIN FIFTY FIVE YEARS THAT WOULD LIVE IN THIS. IN THIS HOUSING JUST. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE YOUR GOAL. SO -- THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT STATUTES ALREADY THAT REQUIRE A FIFTY FIVE YEAR A REQUIREMENT FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING WE BELIEVE IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO REQUIRE A FIFTY FIVE YEAR -- REQUIREMENT FOR FARMWORKERS HOUSING AS WELL TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILLS SUCH AS PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION TWO ONE ONE FIVE FIVE POINT. ONE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY BILLS SO IF A PROPERTY OWNER IF A FARM OWNER DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE AREAS GONNA SUPPORT FARMING FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS AND DOES NOT HAVE. ENOUGH FARMWORKERS TO NEED THE HOUSING THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO USE THIS PROGRAM THEY CAN BUILD THE HOUSING UNDER EXISTING LAW WHERE THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO BUILD HOUSING. THIS IS YOU KNOW IS ONLY A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM FOR THOSE THAT BELIEVE IT FITS THEIR NEEDS. THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE FARMERS HAVE NVER MADE A PREDICTION MISTAKE AS WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT I DON'T SEE THERE'S ANY. DO WHICH ONE BUT THERE'S NO -- PROBLEM OF SEEING IF THERE'S NOT AVAILABLE FARMWORKERS THERE THAT THE AGENCY COULD LOOK AT OTHER LOW INCOME PEOPLE WE DO THAT. AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT PEOPLE TRY TO PUT ON PARTICULARLY -- LOW INCOME HOUSING BUT THOSE ARE MY OBSERVATIONS AND CONCERNS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CENTER THERE ALSO. A YES -- JUST ON THE ISSUE THE H. H. TO A CLEARLY THAT'S A FEDERAL PROGRAM AND I I THINK ONE OF THE SPEAKERS. ADDRESS THIS. WELL ONE OF THE WITNESSES IS IT'S A PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES THE EMPLOYER. TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF THINGS. THERE'S A BACK AND FORTH HERE THAT IF OF WORKERS ARE BROUGHT IN FROM OUT OF COUNTRY. THEN THEY HAVE TO BE PROVIDED WITH CERTAIN THINGS. MEALS TRANSPORTATION. HOUSING -- I CAN IMAGINE THE THE STATE GOVERNMENT THEN WOULD STEP IN TO PROVIDE ALL THESE THINGS WHICH ARE ALREADY A REQUIREMENT OF THIS OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. SO I AND THERE IS. I WANT FORMER HOUSING FOR ANYBODY H. TWO EIGHT OR NOT. BUT I DON'T THINK IT WERE DRAW THE LINE IS THAT SINCE IT'S ALREADY REQUIRED OF THE EMPLOYER. THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM WHY WOULD WE STEP IN AND PROVIDE THAT HOUSING AND PAY FOR IT WHAT PIC PAY FOR THAT HOUSING -- WHEN IT'S ALREADY REQUIRED? IF YOU IF YOU APPLY AND SAY YOU WANT AGE TO A WORKERS YOU DO THAT ITH THE INTENTION THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED OF YOU. PERIOD. SO THIS HOUSING THAT WE WITH OUR STATE DOLLARS WOULD. HELP -- IN A NUMBER OF WAYS WHAT IS STREAMLINING OR FUNDING WHATEVER IT SEEMS TO BE OUT OF BE FOUR US THE OTHER FARMWORKERS -- IN BETTER THEY'RE WORKING IN THE FIELDS -- I DO THINK THAT THERE ILL. ALWAYS BE FARMWORKERS THAT ARE NEEDED -- REGARDLESS -- TO MY COLLEAGUE OVER THERE -- THE FACT THAT. THERE IS. THAT THERE ARE AGE TO A WORKERS BEING RECRUITED HERE MEANS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEED SO -- I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS IT HAS THE RIGHT ELEMENT. TO INCENTIVIZE OF HOUSING FOR FARMWORKER FAMILIES BUT ALSO DRAWS THE LINE AS TO HOW FAR WE'RE WILLING TO GO TO USE OUR TAX DOLLARS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS UP. AND I'M GLAD TO BE. SUPPORTIVE [inaudible] SENATOR BATES. JUST A QUICK COMMENT MAYBE A QUESTION WITH THAT. IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'VE ALMOST DE INCENTIVIZE THE VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. BY REQUIRING THIS THIRD PARTY TO MANAGE SOMEONE ELSE'S LAND. AND THEY RETAIN THE LIABILITY RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL OF THAT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A LOW INCOME HOUSING AND NON PROFITS GENERALLY I KNOW IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. MANAGE THOSE ORIGINALLY DEDICATED LOW INCOME UNITS THAT THIS IS SOMEBODY'S PRIVATE LAND PROVIDING FOR WORKERS THAT YOU KNOW MADE ON COMING GOAL DEPENDING ON THE SEASON AND THE CROPS AND ALL OF THAT. A IDEA THAT PERSON IS GOING TO BEAR THE LIABILITY FOR ALL OF THAT -- AND MAYBE WE VERY WILLINGLY IF THEY HAVE THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE IS BEING MANAGED IN THE PROPER WAY AND ALSO MEETING THE THE STANDARDS THAT CERTAINLY ARE LACKING NOW. SO I WOULD THINK IF YOU'RE OPEN TO A CONSIDERATION OF AMENDING THAT. I THINK IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I THINK IT REALLY INCENTIVIZE HIS PARTICIPATION. BUT WITH THAT PROVISION A VERY DIFFICULT THING WE'VE SEEN AND NOT WORK WELL -- WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND NOW THE COUNTY THAT YOU KNOW PUT IT IN WHERE I MANY YEARS AGO AND THEY THEY TURNED OVER WITHIN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME BY GETTING SOME LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWED THAT. SO I'D I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU COMMENT ON THAT MAYBE RECONSIDER THAT PROVISION NOTHING SURE SO I DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND ALL DEFERRED -- TO OUR SPONSOR -- BUT IT BUT YOU KNOW THE QUESTION OF LIABILITY THAT WAS RAISED BY THIS BILL'S OPPONENTS I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- WE'VE CONSIDERED IT -- ALREADY YOU KNOW AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHO WILL ASSUME THAT LIABILITY AND THEN -- THE ISSUE OF THE INSURANCE AS WELL SO MAYBE THE SPONSOR GOOD -- MAKE THAT COMMENT. YEAH -- THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. WHEN YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYER? HOUSING SOMEONE IT CAN OFTEN CREATE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS -- SECOND TIER OF MANAGEMENT -- ARE. OUR THINKING AND SORRY I LAST WINTER BUT IN LATE -- IT SINCE IT IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM -- WE WANTED TO CREATE A STANDARD THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE THE THE BEST CARE FOR THE TENANTS OF THE THE THE HOUSING WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BY CREATING RULES LIKE THIS THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT MIGHT BE BUILT MAY BE LESS BUT THAT'S WHY A PROGRAM LIKE THIS OF PASSING THE LAW WILL BE MONITORED CLOSELY AND IF CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE THEY CAN BE MADE BUT IF. IT HOUSING LIKE THIS CAN BE DEVELOPED IN HOUSE LIKE THIS IS DEVELOPED IT WILL BE THE BEST HOUSING FOR FARMWORKER FAMILIES AND AND THAT'S WHY THIS THIS -- PORTION THE BILL IS IN THERE WOULD SEEM TO ME YOU NEED TO AN INDEMNIFICATION ON COMPONENT OF IT. I I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE PEOPLE HAVING HOUSING ON THE LAND THAT THEY OWN IN YONGE THEY HAVE NO AUTHORITY OVER WHATSOEVER. WITHOUT DOUBTS YOU KNOW JUST INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME AND YOU KNOW THINKING AND ON MY OWN PROPERTY IF I PUT IN EIGHTY YOU. I WOULD STILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND JOB. MAKING SURE THAT WAS MEETING A STANDARD THAT IF I GAVE IT OVER TO SOMEONE ELSE AND AND THEY GOT TO MANAGE MY EIGHTY YOU ON MY YOU KNOW BACKYARD DOUBTS THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL TO ME EXCUSE ME BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM. BUT I THINK YOU BUILT A POISON PILL INTO IT. SO THAT I WOULD BE. THE BILL DOES NOT. REQUIRE ANY NEGOTIATION TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE MANAGEMENT -- NONPROFT AND THE OWNER SO THEY CAN STRUCTURE THEIR CONTRACT OF HOW THE NONPROFIT MANAGES IT INCLUDING WHO HAS LIABILITY FOR DIFFERENT ISSUES. BASED ON NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE LANDOWNER AND THE NONPROFIT IF THEY DON'T REACH AN AGREEMENT THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO USE THE PROGRAM BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE NONPROFIT IN A LANDOWNER THEY COULD. REACH AGREEMENT ON HOW MAY IN ITS LIABILITY OTHER ISSUES LIKE THAT WOULD BE HANDLED SO WE DO THINK THAT. THOSE ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THAT [inaudible] NEGOTIATION PROCESS. OKAY I SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS ARE. SO -- SOME MEMBER THANK YOU. FOR THE MOTION BY SENATOR ALSO -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I AM PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR. OF THE BILL AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT -- TO TEENS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. I MEAN WE HAVE TO BACK UP AND LOOK AT WHY THIS IS NECESSARY I'M A SUPPORTER OF STREAMLINING AND I'VE YOU KNOW I AUTHORED. BIG STREAMLINING BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US -- TO TO MOVE TO EXPEDITE HOUSING APPROVALS AND CONSTRUCTION -- AND TO TRIED TO REMOVE SOME OF THE LOCAL OBSTRUCTION TO HOUSING AND WE SEE A CLOUT IN NUMBER WAYS AND IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS IN THE BAY AREA -- WE YOU KNOW ZONE OUR LAND TO BAN APARTMENT BUILDINGS WE MAKE A REALLY HARD TO BUILD ANYTHING. AND THEN PEOPLE WONDER WHY PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THEIR IN THEIR CARS -- AND EIGHT SOMETIMES DON'T CONNECTED TO AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DO THAT AND IN OUR CULTURAL COMMUNITIES -- WE HAVE -- AND IT'S VERY HARD TO GET APPROVAL TO BUILD FARMWORKERS HOUSING AND YOU WONDER WONDER WHY FARMWORKERS ARE LIVING IN SUCH. DEPLORABLE -- CONDITIONS -- AND FARMWORKERS ARE FUELING THESE LOCAL ECONOMIES HELPING FUEL THE ECONOMY OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER. I'M FASTER OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD -- THIS HOUSING -- IN TERMS OF THE AGE TO A ISSUE AND I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO AND ANOTHER BILL. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ENSURE THAT EACH WAY WORKERS WHO ARE HERE CAN BE HOUSE. BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT PROJECTS AS A CENTER THERE ALSO SET A RECEIVING A PUBLIC FUNDS -- AND ONE PUBLIC FUNDS OR ISSUE -- I THINK IT IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE TO FOCUS THOSE FUNDS -- ON HOUSING -- FOR FAMILIES YOU KNOW WHO WERE WHO ERE REALLY OR CALIFORNIA -- FARMWORKER FAMILIES AND WHO ARE -- YOU KNOW WHO WHO WERE -- NOT THE AS OPPOSED TO THE H. TO A AND MAYBE SOME OF THOSE A TO A WORKERS WILL ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW AS FOR HIM AS WE KNOW HAPPENS MOST PEOPLE STAY IN. AND UP INTEGRATING INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT'S A GOOD THING -- BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC FUNDS I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING -- TO FOCUS A ON THESE FAMILIES -- SO I I SUPPORT THAT ASPECT OF THE BILL -- AS WELL -- I ALSO SAW A COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF WHO IS MANAGING THE PROPERTIES AND I OF COURSE RUN -- AN ILL FATED A FORMER FOR HOUSING BILL LAST YEAR ON I LEARNED A LOT DURING THE PROCESS AND I'M GLAD THIS BILL IS MOVING FORWARD -- IN A STRONG WAY -- BUT THE IDEA OF HAVING SOMEONE BE BOTH YOUR LANDLORD AND YOUR BOSS IS IS PROBLEMATIC -- IN A LOT OF WAYS -- AND HAVING A THIRD PARTY AND WE HAVE MANY VERY REPUTABLE -- NONPROFIT -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN VERY RESPONSIBLY MANAGE -- THESE PROPERTIES -- AND SO AGAIN. PUBLIC FUNDS ARE BEING USED HERE SO I DON'T THINK IT IS OUTRAGEOUS -- TO SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE STRUCTURED -- THIS WAY -- AND AS WAS NOTED THE AGREEMENTS CAN BE STRUCTURED AND NEGOTIATED -- SO THIS IS A GOOD BILL -- I SUPPORTED -- I AM RECOMMENDING THAT THE COMMITTEE PASS -- THIS BILL OUT. AND FINALLY ON THE H. TO A ISSUE I DO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THAT ISSUE -- DISSECTION OFTHE BILL -- RELATES -- TO THE DEPARTMENTOF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT GOD IS AN AREA YOU SEE THE THAT IS WITHIN THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF OF THE SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE. AND HAD THAT BEEN THE ONLY THING IN THE BILL -- THE BILL WOULD HAVE BEEN SINGLE REFERRED TO THE SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE -- SO OUR HOUSING COMMITTEE STAFF HAS AWFULLY BAD AT THE AGE TO A RESTRICTION -- AND ANALYZED IT AND THIS -- WE SUPPORT IT -- SO WITH THAT -- IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS -- YOU MAY YOU MAY CLOSE. AND SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS -- AND THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS BY -- OUR CHAIRMAN AND RESPECT ASPEN ABOUT. THANK YOU OKAY THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATOR DROSS SO AND WE WILL CALL THE ROLL.
