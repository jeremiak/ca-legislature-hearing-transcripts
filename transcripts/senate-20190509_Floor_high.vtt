IN THE STATE.

00:36:16.607 --> 00:36:17.942
I IN FACT A COLLEAGUE OF OURS

FROM VENTURA HAS A HAS

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.379
LEGISLATION.

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.414
THAT PROMOTES A TASK FORCE ABOUT

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:24.649
THE FUTURE OF WORK.

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:26.584
WHICH GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT

00:36:26.651 --> 00:36:28.586
THIS BILL IS TRYING TO SOLVE.

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.555
BUT FOR ME.

00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:32.356
THE ANSWER IS TO NOT.

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:33.891
SIGN ME OR STOP TECHNOLOGY

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:36.093
INNOVATION.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.697
THE ANSWER IT LIES IN EDUCATION.

TRAINING AND RETRAINING.

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:42.934
THAT THE DISRUPTION THAT'S GOING

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.169
TO BE CAUSED BY.

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:46.737

OF AUTONOMY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:50.007
AND MANY OTHER THINGS IN OUR

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.696
LOWER COSTS.

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:12.730
IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:15.266
SAFETY.

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.400
IT'S AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:17.435
TRANSIT.

00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:18.769
IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE FROM THEIR

HOUSES OR THEIR APARTMENTS TO

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:22.607
TRANSIT IN A MORE EFFICIENT

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:24.208
EFFECTIVE WAY WE'RE GOING TO

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:25.343
PROMOTE.

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:26.644
OUR TRANSIT SYSTEMS THAT ARE SO

00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:29.280
IMPORTANT TO OUR FUTURE.

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.915
THEY'RE MEANT TO THAT IT BE DONE

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.483
AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.318
THESE A THOMAS VEHICLES ARE

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:37.021
PRINCIPALLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:38.556
AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:40.791
INTO THESE THE PROMOTION OF

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:42.727
THESE VEHICLES.

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:45.096
HELP CALIFORNIA BECOME A LEADER

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:47.698
IN THE WORLD -- IN IN

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:50.468
MANUFACTURING I IN THE ARE IN DE

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.136
IN THIS WHOLE SPACE WHY WOULD WE

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:55.673
WANT TO SIGN ME -- THAT WORK.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.475
IS THE TIME OF HIS VEHICLES ARE

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:58.009
NOT SOME.

00:37:58.075 --> 00:37:59.744
ODD.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:00.277
THING THAT'S FAR INTO THE

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.278
DISTANCE.

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:02.947
THESE A THOMAS VEHICLES TRANSIT

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:05.616
VEHICLES ARE BEING TESTED NOW

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:06.350
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:06.651
[inaudible]

00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:08.819
ON STREETS.

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:11.422
ON OUR PROPERTY I KNOW IN MY

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:13.257
DISTRICT BOTH AND NOT SAN RAMON

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:14.425

THESE ECONOMIST VEHICLES ARE

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:17.261
BEING TESTED IN MANY THINK ABOUT

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.230
WHAT ARE THEY I IN THIS CASE

00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:21.032
THERE TWELVE PASSENGER VEHICLES

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:23.334
ARE NOT GIANT BUSES -- YES SIX

00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:25.703
SEATS IN SIX PLACES WHERE YOU

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.607
CAN STAND -- AND WHILE WE MAY

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:31.642
THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:33.611
ONLY ABOUT GIANT BUS SYSTEMS ARE

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:35.513
GIANT BUSES WE DON'T KNOW WHERE

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:36.847
THAT TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO LEAD

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:38.416
IN THE FUTURE IS IT GOING TO BE

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.918
SIX PASSENGER. TWELVE PASSENGER

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:41.986
TWENTY PASSENGER.

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:43.721
WHERE IS THIS ISSUE POTS STOP IN

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.222
TERMS OF HAVING AT A TRANSIT

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:46.724
EMPLOYEE ON EVERY EVERYONE OF

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:47.925
THEM?

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:48.826
SO.

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:50.094
IT IS TRUE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:53.064
DISRUPTIVE.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.499
BUT THINK ABOUT IT -- WOULD WE

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:56.934
SAY WE WANT TO DEFEND THE HORSE

00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:59.136
AND BUGGY WOULD WE WANT TO SAY

00:38:59.203 --> 00:39:01.172
WE WANT TO DEFEND THE TYPEWRITER.

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:03.040
THESE THINGS ON ALL OUR DESKS.

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:04.742
THE IN THESE THIS IS ANOTHER

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:07.178
FORM OF DISRUPTION OF TECHNOLOGY

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:08.546
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WE MIGHT

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:10.281
HAVE RELIED UPON TO WRITE MEMOS

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:11.482
AND LETTERS AND ALL THE REST OF

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:12.783
THE THINGS THAT WE AT WEEK WE

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.152
COUNT ON IN OUR WORK WORLD.

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:17.755
SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS THAT

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:19.323
A COMMITMENT TO WORK ON THIS

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.526
LAST MILE ISSUE.

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:23.527
BUT I THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:25.229
THIS I IN THIS LEGISLATION ON

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:26.964
THIS AREA AND THROUGHOUT STATE

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:28.032
GOVERNMENT IS TO NOT PUT OUR

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.400
HEAD IN THE SAND THE ANSWER FOR

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.402
US IS THE LEAD.

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:33.170
ON EDUCATION ON TRAINING AND

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:34.205
RETRAINING I THINK THAT'S THE

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.173
BETTER SOLUTION AND WHY CAN'T

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.975
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:38.275

EXPRESSED -- BY THE SENATOR.

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:55.326
FROM AROUND -- ABOUT -- WE NEED

TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:59.997
TECHNOLOGICAL -- CHANGES AND NOT

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:02.166
TO REACH FOR OUT INTO THE FUTURE

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.934
IN PARTICULAR -- WHEN WE DON'T

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:04.902

TODAY -- BECAUSE IT DOES SUNSET

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.443
AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THE

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.211
REALITY IS THAT IT'S GOING TO

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:16.180
TAKE BEFORE WE GET TO A POINT.

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:18.716
WHERE WE HAVE TRULY AUTONOMOUS?

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.451
VEHICLES WITHOUT ANYONE IN THEM

00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:23.354
OPERATING -- AS PART OF OUR

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:23.954
GENERAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:25.656
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:40:25.723 --> 00:40:27.091
GOING TO BE HAPPENING IN THE

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:28.993
IMMEDIATE FUTURE I'M COMFORTABLE

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.628

I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:42.473
THINK IT'S A MODEST --

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.775
REQUIREMENT A IN OTHER COUNTRIES

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:46.010
WHERE THEY HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:48.379
AND HIGHER SPEED RAIL THEY HAVE

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.947
POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL THAT

00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:51.248
ALLOWS A TRAIN TO SLOW

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:53.450
AUTOMATICALLY WHEN IT'S GOING

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:55.719
AROUND A CURVE -- FOR IT HAS THE

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.555
POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL FOR WHEN

00:40:57.621 --> 00:41:00.057
THERE'S A NEED FOR EARTHQUAKE

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:01.158
DETECTION.

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:02.660
AND THE LIKE BUT THEY ALWAYS

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:04.862
HAVE SOMEBODY ON BOARD A LIVE

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:07.798
PERSON WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:10.334
SAFETY ISSUES WITH PASSENGERS

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:13.537
BOARDING -- PASSENGER RAIL AND

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:14.772
POSING A THREAT TO WHETHER

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:17.208
PASSENGERS THAT IS ALSO A REASON

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:18.442
WHY WE HAVE A NEED TO HAVE

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:19.944
SOMEBODY ON BOARD.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.879
AND THEN FINALLY FOR ANY MEDICAL

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.514
EMERGENCY I WAS AT A PEACE

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:24.748
OFFICERS MEMORIAL EVENT

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:27.084
YESTERDAY AND WE HAD ONE PERSON

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.353
IN ATTENDANCE WHO PASSED OUT AND

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.654
BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WERE AROUND.

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.823
A MEDICAL PERSONNEL WILL BE ABLE

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.192
TO BE ON THE SPOT RIGHT AWAY SO

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:36.727
I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS THAT

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:39.463
WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THAT LAST

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:43.767
ISSUE BUT I STRONGLY RECOMMEND

BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:55.279
AROUND AUTOMATION THE FUTURE OF

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:56.780
WORK FOR A FEW YEARS NOW THE

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:59.250
GOVERNOR RECENTLY -- ANNOUNCED A

00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:00.618
FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION IN

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:02.686
FACT -- THE LAST WEEK ON

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:04.288
INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY.

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.423
AND ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.959
ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW RIDE SHARING

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:10.561
DRIVERS ARE STRIKING.

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:12.396
TRYING TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:14.732
SYSTEM AND OPPORTUNITIES IN AN

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:16.166
INCREASINGLY AUTOMATED IN

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:17.434
NETWORK FUTURE [inaudible]

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.203
THERE ARE.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.871
CHALLENGES WITH THIS LEGISLATION

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:23.007
THE MECHANICS I THINK YOU NEED

00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:23.874
WORK.

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.009
I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:26.844
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS IS

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:28.746
AN IMPORTANT WAY.

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.648
TO A CERTAIN ONESELF AND FINE

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:32.716
MECHANICS THAT ARE TAILORED TO

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:34.218
THE NATURE OF THIS KIND OF

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:35.619
TRANSIT SERVICE AND NOT

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.054
ARBITRARILY PUSHING OUT.

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:38.355
OTHER AUTOMATED VEHICLE

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:40.457
TECHNOLOGIES BUT THAT SAID I

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:42.593
THINK.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.162
ON BALANCE WE HAVE TO STAND WITH

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:46.997
THE WORKING PEOPLE OF THIS STATE.

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:48.532
AND PUT PEOPLE FIRST AND THAT'S

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.834
WHY I'M UP IN SUPPORT TODAY.

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.503
AS WELL AS WITH.

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.705
THOSE STRIKING AND OTHERS OUT

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.206
THERE SEEKING SOME KIND OF

THIS IS JUSTIN MANUFACTURING

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:05.702
LESIONS ON MOBILE WE'RE TALKING

ABOUT TRANSPORTATION WHERE WE

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.106

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:15.979
HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THESE

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:18.282
PROCESSES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:19.216

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:21.185
TRANSPORTING YOURSELF FROM POINT

A TO POINT B..

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:25.556
BUT DOING IT SAFELY AND IT'S NOT

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:27.458
JUST ABOUT LOOKING FOR A

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:28.992
LOCATION.

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:32.196
IT'S ABOUT HAVING ALL THE

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:33.897
SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:37.334
PEOPLE ARE SAFE IN THAT PROCESS.

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:39.403
THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THERE YET

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.537
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS A

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:42.706
VERY MODEST BILL THIS IS A VERY

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:44.842
REASONABLE BILL.

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:47.377
AS IT EVOLVES.

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.780
IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE GONNA NEED.

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.748
A HUMAN ELEMENT TO BE PART OF

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.183
THIS PROCESS WITH.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.119
RIGHT CURRENTLY AS AUTONOMOUS

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:58.255
TECHNOLOGY IS BEING DEVELOPED --

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.125
PROCESS OUT THERE.

00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:02.960
WE CAN'T RISK THIS AND IT'S NOT

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:05.696
ABOUT STIFLING INNOVATION

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:08.665
BECAUSE EVEN WITH -- VEHICLES

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:09.933

ADVANCEMENTS IN IN IN THIS AREA

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:24.982
I THINK IT'S LUDICROUS TO MAKE

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:26.984
THOSE ARGUMENTS THIS BILL DOES

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.386

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:40.364
THIS TECHNOLOGY AND THEY'RE SAFE

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.666
WHEN THEY'RE BEING TRANSPORTED.

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:44.268
THIS IS ALL ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY

00:46:44.334 --> 00:46:46.103
THIS IS A VERY MODEST BILL I

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:46.670

IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE COUNTLESS

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.544
UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENTS

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:55.545
PRESENT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ARE

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:56.580
SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH CURRENTLY THE

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:58.048
DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS SURVEYS

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.883
EVERY THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THE

HOSPITALS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:02.619
LAW.

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:04.488
THIS PERIODIC CHECK IS FAR TOO

00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:06.623
INFREQUENT ALLOWS HOSPITALS TO

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:07.524
PREPARE.

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.826

CONDUCT THEIR SURVEY.

00:52:11.194 --> 00:52:12.796
SB TWO TWO SEVEN WOULD ADDRESS

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.564
THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THAT

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:15.799
THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCT

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:17.734

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:21.004
STAFFING REQUIREMENTS.

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.072
THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO EMPOWER

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.907
THE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE THE

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.175
STAFFING REQUIREMENT.

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:27.978
WITH FINES IN CASES WHERE THOSE

00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:29.312
RATIOS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED.

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:30.947
MEMBERS I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:32.883
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOSPITALS

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:34.618
RECEIVING FINES WHEN A NURSE

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.620
CALLS OUT SICK OR HAVING A

00:52:36.686 --> 00:52:38.855
MERCHANT SEES THAT REQUIRE THEM

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:42.225
TO UNEXPECTEDLY LEAVE WORK.

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:44.127
IN RESPONSE TO THIS I WOULD SAY.

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:45.862
IF HOSPITALS ARE CONTINUALLY

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:47.397
STAFFING.

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:49.566
LEVELS WERE FROM ONE OR TWO

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:51.234
NURSES CALL OUT SICK PUTS THEM

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:53.770
AT RISK OF BEING OUT OF RATIO.

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:54.938
THEN THIS IS A SYSTEMATIC

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.606
PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:57.707
ADDRESSED.

00:52:57.774 --> 00:52:59.743
SECONDLY IT IS NEVER BEEN MY

INTENT TO PUNISH HOSPITALS THAT

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:03.713
ARE GOOD ACTORS AND I'M

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.015

CONVERSATION.

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:13.590
SB TWO TWO SEVEN IS CRITICALLY

00:53:13.657 --> 00:53:15.892
IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:20.230
IN CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.685
PEOPLE SHOWING UP LATE TO KNOW

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:43.286
WE DO HAVE SOME TRAFFIC ISSUES

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:44.454
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:47.958
SB ONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOLVING

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:49.159
THAT HASN'T SOLVED YET.

00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:50.727
AND PEOPLE DO GET SICK AND TWO

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:53.697
PEOPLE HAVE. SIX CHILDREN AND

00:53:53.763 --> 00:53:55.332
THESE BONDS ARE VERY PUNITIVE I

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:57.067
MEAN FOR THE FIRST OFFENSE

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:59.102
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SIXTY

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:01.171
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE SECOND --

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:03.440
VIOLATION -- I DON'T THINK A

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:05.408
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS WAKE UP

00:54:05.475 --> 00:54:06.643
IN THE MORNING AND SAY YOU KNOW

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.078
I'M GONNA TRY TO PULL BACK AS

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:09.212
MANY NURSES I POSSIBLY PLANNED

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:11.715
OCCURS THE BOTTOM LINE OF OUR

00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:12.916
HOSPITALS.

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:14.084
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE WAY OF --

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.784
HEALTH CARE RATES AND AND

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:16.186
HOSPITAL STAYS I MEAN THEY'RE

00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:17.988
GOING UP DRAMATICALLY YOU THINK

00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:19.289
THESE FINES ARE JUST GONNA HURT

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:20.256
THE HOSPITAL THE NEXT COULD HURT

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:21.558
THE HOSPITAL TO BE PASSED ON TO

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:22.993
THE CONSUMER PASSED ON TO THE

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.294
INSURANCE COMPANIES WE SEE.

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:25.729
RISING PREMIUMS EVERY YEAR IN

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:27.564
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IS

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:29.132
OPEN ENROLLMENT -- THERE NEEDS

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:31.801
TO BE SOME FAIRNESS TO THIS LAW

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:33.703
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LOGICAL

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:37.073
EXCUSES -- THE ALLOW HOSPITALS

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.975
TO USE THEIR BEST EFFORTS. TO

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:40.443
MAKE SURE THOSE RATIOS ARE IN

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:42.112
FACT IN PLACE IN THE BEST

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:43.813
INTEREST OF THE PATIENT SAFETY.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.482
I THINK THE BILL IS TO PUNITIVE

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:49.653
I THINK IT'S TOO RIGID AND FOR

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:52.188
THOSE REASONS I REGION OF THANK

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:54.357
YOU US SENATOR CAFIERO.

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:55.659
F. FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ROTH.

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.093
THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER --

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.162
QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR.

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:00.997
WOULD YOU ACCEPT A QUESTION I

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:01.965
WOULD.

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:02.899
CENTER COVER EUROPE YOU MAKERS

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:05.335
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THROUGH THE

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.704
PRO TEM -- MY CONCERN IS ARE THE

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.272
SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS OF WHICH I

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:11.908
HAVE MANY MANY IN MY DISTRICT --

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.878
AND THEY OPERATE ON REALLY SLIM

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:16.312
MARGINS -- THE LAST THING I

00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:17.947
THINK WE WANT IS TO DRIVE THE

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.149
SMALL HOSPITALS OUT OF BUSINESS

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:20.350
BECAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE NO

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:22.919
HOSPITAL IN SOME OF OUR RURAL.

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.054
COUNTIES AND SO I WONDER IF YOU

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.591
COULD ADDRESS HOW YOUR BILL --

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:30.093
HANDLES SMALL RURAL.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.896
HOSPITALS AND IN IN YOUR

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:34.130
THOUGHTS MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.899
I I DID SUPPORT THIS LAST YEAR

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.434
WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY-- I

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.835
WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE BUT I AM

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:39.369
CONCERNED ABOUT MY RURAL

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:41.337
HOSPITALS THANK YOU SENATOR I

00:55:41.404 --> 00:55:42.505
APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION.

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:44.474
SO CURRENTLY UNDER CURRENT LAW

00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:46.209
ON THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.545
THIS -- RURAL HOSPITALS CAN

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:50.980
APPLY FOR A WAIVER AND THE RATIO

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.015
IF THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.983
RECRUITING NURSES AND THEY FEEL

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.518
THAT THEY WILL BE OUT OF RATIO.

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.487
A RECENT STUDY WAS DONE AND IN

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:59.355
THE PAST FIVE YEARS NO RURAL

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:02.225
HOSPITAL HAS PULLED A WAIVER SO

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:03.626
THEY STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:04.694
BUT THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE

00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:06.162
THAT THEY'RE NOT HAVING A

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:07.497
PROBLEM RECRUITING.

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:09.199
BUT ALSO TWO TWO SEVEN MY

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:11.401
CURRENT BILL CLARIFIES THAT CV

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:13.503
PH WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.705
THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:17.440
SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS.

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:18.808
PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING A FINE SO

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:19.709
I THINK THAT WE HAVE EVEN

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:23.012
STRENGTHENED THE LANGUAGE FOR

00:56:23.079 --> 00:56:24.180
SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS.

00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:25.482
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:30.687

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.422
THAT IT WILL BE A MORE EXPANSIVE.

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.191

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:37.766
OUTCOMES.

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.868
