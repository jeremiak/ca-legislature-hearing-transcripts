EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS.

WERE UNSANITARY OVERCROWDED.

00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:58.309

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.845
WHICH DOES CONVICTED OF OWING

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:01.979
MONEY.

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.214
LET ME REPEAT THAT UP --

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:05.116
WE MONEY.

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:06.818
THAT THEY COULD NOT PAY WERE

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:09.153
PLACED IN GENERAL POPULATION

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.122
WITH VIOLENT CRIMINALS.

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.857
DICKENS WAS FORCED TO LEAVE

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:14.926
SCHOOL TO WORK IN A FACTORY WHEN

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:15.860

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:19.230
WAS THROWN INTO DEBTORS PRISON.

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:21.099
WE HAVE PEOPLE NOW THERE WERE

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.101
LOOK AT SHOPLIFTING.

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.169
AS A METHOD OF SEEN PEOPLE BACK

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:26.938
TO PRISON BY MAKING IT A FELONY.

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.406
WE SHOULDN'T REGRESSED BACK TO

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:30.007
THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WE SHOULD

00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:32.009
BE MOVING FORWARD I THINK THIS

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.545
IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO SHOW

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:35.913
HOW.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.182
A MONETARY RESTRICTIVE SYSTEM

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:40.952
CAN LEAD. TO TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE

00:33:41.018 --> 00:33:42.487
LIVING IN POVERTY.

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:43.755
FURTHER EXACERBATE THEIR

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:45.757
SITUATION.

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:46.491
AND SO I AM GOING UP.

00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:50.228
QUICKLY OKAY ANYONE TO MAKE ANY

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:51.529
OPENING STATEMENTS OTHERWISE

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:55.233
WE'LL GO RIGHT AND IT OF THAT I

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:58.069
WOULD LIKE [inaudible]

FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING --

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.113
IT WAS SOMETHING I THINK WE

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.148
TALKED ABOUT.

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:12.717
DURING MOST OF THE REST OF LAST

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:14.085
SESSION --

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:15.653
AND I'M GLAD TO SEE SO MANY

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.055
FACES FAMILIAR AND NEW --

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:19.557
TO THIS HEARING BECAUSE I THINK

00:34:19.624 --> 00:34:21.025
IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I'M

00:34:21.092 --> 00:34:22.427
SURE LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:24.729
I'M HERE TO LISTEN AND TO LEARN

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:26.497
SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ACTION.

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.599
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:30.501
ARE HEARING SOLUTIONS AND

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.103
TALKING ABOUT UNCOMFORTABLE

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.504
PROBLEMS THAT ARE FACED IN THE

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:34.639
SYSTEM.

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:37.008
SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP A SYSTEM

00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:38.976
THAT IS FAIR --

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.678
WE HAVE GOT TO STOP BUILDING

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:43.648
SYSTEMS ON THE BACKS OF THE POOR

00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:46.284
AND THEN BREAKING THEIR BACKS

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.454
BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR --

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.888
I WON'T GET IN WHILE THE UNITED

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:53.057

JUSTICE CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.895
AMENDMENT TO MEAN THAT JAILING

00:34:57.962 --> 00:34:59.897
PEOPLE FOR NOT PAYING FINES.

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:03.034
AND FEES IS THE LEGAL UNLESS THE

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.235
NON PAYMENT WAS WILL FALL WE

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.503
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.005
ABOUT FOR REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES.

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:10.641
ABOUT OUR JUDGES ABOUT OFFENDERS

00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:11.909
AND THE PARENTS AND FAMILY

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.711
MEMBERS OF THE OFFENDERS ABOUT

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.948
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO ABOUT

00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:18.349
RACE AND ECONOMICS.

00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:19.884
AS IT RELATES TO JUDGES THERE

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.819
ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT LIE

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:25.323
IN HOW JUDGES INTERPRET THE WORD

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:26.924
WELL -- FOR

00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:28.025
AND SO JAILING SOMEONE BECAUSE

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:29.760
THEY ARE AN ABLE TO PAY FINES

00:35:29.827 --> 00:35:32.129
AND FEES AND HAVING INCONSISTENT

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:33.631
STANDARDS ABOUT HOW WILLFUL IS

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:36.834
DEFINED IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.870
WE HAVE TO WE HAVE INSTANCES

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:40.371
WHERE IF JUVENILES HAVE

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:41.839
OUTSTANDING DEBT BY THE TIME

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:43.374
THEY TURN EIGHTEEN OR WHEN THEY

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.109
TURN EIGHTEEN THAT DEBT TURNS

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.011
INTO A CIVIL JUDGMENT WE HAVE

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.412
SITUATIONS WHERE YOUNG FOLKS ARE

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:49.747
JAIL.

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:51.315
ARE UNABLE TO PAY THAT DEBT THAT

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:53.150
DEBT THEN GOES TO THE PARENTS OF

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:54.385
THE PARENTS ARE UNABLE TO PAY

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:56.187
THE DEBT THEN THE PARENTS ARE

00:35:56.254 --> 00:35:57.688
JAILED AS WELL.

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.023
WE HAVE TO HAVE SERIOUS

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.726
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.761
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT KIND OF

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.363
PROCESS OF THOSE KINDS OF

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:07.965
PROCEDURES WE HAVE GOT TO US WE

00:36:08.032 --> 00:36:09.534
HAVE TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT LAW

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.235
ENFORCEMENT IS ASKED TO DO

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:12.870
DOUBLE DUTY.

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.138
LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT BE

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:17.174
PROTECTING AND COLLECTING.

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.843
THAT JUST AIN'T RIGHT.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:23.080
AND IT ALLOWS FOR A LOT OF HOLES.

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:24.348
TO BE BY PASSED.

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:26.551
AND THEN LASTLY ULTIMATELY WE

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:28.419
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE RACE.

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:30.254
IMPLICATIONS ON THE ECONOMIC áP

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:32.089
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS KIND OF

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:33.357
SYSTEM.

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:34.659
WE KNOW THAT FOR AFRICAN

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:37.962
AMERICANS THEIR 68% LESS LIKELY

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.564
TO HAVE CASES DISMISSED BY THE

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.398
COURT.

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:43.734
AT LEAST 50% MORE LIKELY TO THAT

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:46.504
LEAD TO ARREST AND ACCOUNT 492%

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:48.205
OF CASES IN WHICH COURT ISSUE

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:49.941
THE COURT WILL ISSUE AN ARREST

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:51.676
WARRANT.

00:36:51.742 --> 00:36:53.311
THIS SAME NUMBER IS NOT AS HIGH

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:55.179
CAN BE SAID FOR OTHER --

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:57.515
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SO WE

00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:58.816
HAVE GOT TO ALSO HAVE

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:00.117
UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:01.218
ABOUT WHY THERE ARE

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:02.720
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:05.022
PEOPLE OF COLOR AND POOR PEOPLE

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:06.490
THAT ARE JAILED AND ULTIMATELY

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.492
THEY ARE JAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:10.695
POOR.

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:12.363
I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN COME TO

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.031
SOME SOLUTIONS IN THIS HEARING

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:15.600
SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH OUR

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:18.803
ADVOCATES AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS.

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.972
TO REALLY MAKE THIS A LEGITIMATE

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:23.040
AND ADJUST TO SYSTEM SO THANK

00:37:23.107 --> 00:37:25.776

YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY I AM.

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.748
I THINK THAT EVERYONE WOULD

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.216
AGREE THAT --

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:34.251
WE HAVE A A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:36.954
PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS WITHIN THE

00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:39.256
THE MAJORITY.

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:41.392
OF THESE --

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.294
FINES ARE BEING COLLECTED.

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:46.130
OUR BECAUSE OF ENFORCEMENT

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:47.565
AGAINST TRAFFIC OFFENSE.

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:48.199
THESE AREN'T --

00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:50.201
CRIMINAL OFFENSES THESE ARE

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:51.502
PRIMARILY INFRACTIONS.

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.604
BEING COMMITTED BY BY THE

00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:54.705
GENERAL PUBLIC.

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:58.409
WE TALK ABOUT --

00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:01.012
THE THE UNFAIR FOCUS UPON THE

00:38:01.078 --> 00:38:01.812
POOR.

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:02.813
I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S A

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.715
TRAFFIC CITATION FOR FOUR

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.684
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:09.754
IS TOUGH FOR MOST AMERICANS MOST

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.323
CALIFORNIA'S NOT JUST POOR.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.025
AND HERE'S THE BIGGER PROBLEM WE

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:14.825
TALK ABOUT.

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:15.826
BEING ABLE TO ARRIVE AT

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:17.695
SOLUTIONS I HOPE WE DON'T JUST

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:18.829
GET TOO HEAVY.

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:20.698
ON THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE ALL

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:22.199
AGREE ON THE PROBLEM.

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.534
THE SOLUTIONS BECOME VERY VERY

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:24.635
DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE'VE ARRIVED

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:26.337
AT THIS PROBLEM.

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:29.073
OVER DECADES.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.375
THIS IS BEEN AN INCREMENTAL --

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:33.377
DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS TYPE OF

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:34.912
THING BECAUSE NOW.

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:37.581
WE HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:40.217
LANCE ON THE FUNDS THAT COME

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:41.552
FROM THESE OFFENSES.

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:43.521
HAD SO WHEN WE SAY THAT WE WANT

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.089
TO DIVERT.

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.490
THIS FUNDING MECHANISM TO THE

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:47.692
GENERAL FUND WHICH IS LESS

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:49.160
RELIABLE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:50.361
HUGE.

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.263
OUTRAGE BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.431
FUNDED BY.

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:55.700
THESE FUNDS AND SO WE HAVE A

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:56.934
VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE

00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:59.003
SHOULD IDENTIFY A SERIOUS AND

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.405
THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTIONS BUT TO

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:02.039
ME.

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:03.474
THE REMEDY IS THE SAME WAY THAT

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.076
WE GOT HERE IT'S GOING TO HAVE

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:06.210
TO BE INCREMENTAL.

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.946
AND AND STARTING TO A REDUCE

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.614
SOME OF THESE COSTS --

00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:12.416
THAT'S NOT GONNA COME WITHOUT

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.618
SOME REALLY SEVERE --

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.587
DIFFICULTY SO.

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:18.923
I HATE TO A RAIN ON THE PARADE

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:19.757
BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:21.258
TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND I

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.127
HOPE THAT WE CAN PUT OUR HEADS

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:24.962
TOGETHER FIGURE THIS OUT.

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.964
THANK YOU IN [inaudible]

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:29.700

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:30.301
OKAY.

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.336
SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE OVERVIEW

COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY DO

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:44.101
NOT CHARGE THAT FEE AT ALL. FOR

TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. TO EITHER

OVER THREE HOURS IN THAT

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:14.531
SCENARIO AS WE CREATED --

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:15.032
WE FIND AT THE LEVEL OF

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:16.667
SUPERVISION SIGNIFICANTLY

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:18.335

THAT LOW SUPERVISION PROBATION

00:47:23.774 --> 00:47:26.109

THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER

THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:36.486
WE GO OVER THE BUTTE COUNTY ON

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:37.654
THE FAR RIGHT WITH YET THE LOSI

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:38.755
PROVISION PROVISIONAL WOULD ONLY --

00:47:38.822 --> 00:47:39.890
ABOUT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:42.726
THE HIGHS --

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.394
ABOUT SIXTEEN TIMES THAT AMOUNT

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:47.331
OR SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:48.832

THE YEAH.

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:02.946
CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE --

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:05.682
BUT HOW MUCH.

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:08.318
ON COLLECTED FEES AND FINES --

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:09.419
IS KIND OF OUTSTANDING EVERY

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:10.887
WEEK WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE.

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:12.289
WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.857
TRAFFIC.

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.459
FINES AND FEES AND HOW MUCH TO

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:18.061
COURTS.

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:19.529
THOSE IS NEVER GONNA MOUNT THEY

00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:20.430
WERE ASKED I THINK THEY WERE

00:48:20.497 --> 00:48:21.765
LIKE ONE POINT EIGHT WHEN I GOT

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:22.833
IN TWENTY TWELVE IS LIKE ONE

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:24.034
POINT.

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.069
EIGHT BILLION OUT THERE AND THEY

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:27.971
WERE ASKING FOR A BILLION IN.

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.840
AND BEING A FRESHMAN ASSEMBLY

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:30.574
MEMBER I SAID ONCE YOU JUST

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:32.209
COLLECTED IN IN YOU CAN SOLVE

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:33.577
YOUR BUDGET PROBLEM.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.579
AND EVIDENTLY I LEARNED IS NOT

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:37.147
THAT EASY.

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:39.316
TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH.

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:42.586
ARE WE LOOKING OUT THERE IN THE

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:44.688
SO AS A FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE ARE

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.623
TALKING ABOUT TWELVE BILLION A

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.025
LITTLE BIT OVER TWELVE BILLION

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.726
IN OUTSTANDING.

00:48:49.793 --> 00:48:51.528
DEBT -- ONE

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:52.496
OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:54.231
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT --

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.565
ONE OF THINGS THAT WE FOUND IS

00:48:55.632 --> 00:48:58.368
THAT THERE WAS SOME WEAKNESSES

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.570
IN THE COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.606
OF INFORMATION ABOUT COLLECTIONS

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:04.174
AND DISTRIBUTION.

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.075
AND NE OF OUR REPORTS WE

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.543
ACTUALLY HAVE A FIGURE THAT

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.778
SHOWS -- A

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:10.113
GRAPHIC OF THE MISMATCH BETWEEN

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.815
THE TWO AND SO WE DID WE DID

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:15.419
OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS PROVE THAT

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:16.820
SIDE BECAUSE ONE OF THE ONE OF

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:17.821
THE THINGS THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:20.090
IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:22.359
TO MAKE CHANGES OR TO HELP THEM

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:23.593
MAKE DECISIONS COMPREHENSIVE

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:26.029
INFORMATION IS HELPFUL I NEED IT.

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:27.164
OF THE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.799
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MUCH OF THAT IS

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:30.233
ACTUALLY COLLECTIBLE AND SO WHEN

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.835
WE TALK ABOUT ACTUAL

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.704
COLLECTIBILITY.

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.472
ON IT COSTS COURTS AND COUNTIES

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:37.507
A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO COLLECT

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.743
THESE DOLLARS AND AT SOME POINT

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.346
IT COSTS YOU MORE THAN WHAT YOU

00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:44.114
WOULD BRING IN AND THAT'S WHAT

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:45.849
WHEN WE SAY I ON COLLECTIBLE

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.050
THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN.

00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:47.751
AND SO ONE OF THE

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.419
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAD WAS

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:50.320
THAT WE THOUGHT THAT THERE

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:51.922
SHOULD BE AN ASSESSMENT.

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:54.257
ABOUT THE COLLECTIBILITY OF OF

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:57.227
THAT DEBT.

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.962
GOOD AND THEN YOU MENTIONED.

00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:01.998
THERE FOR IT. FIFTY PINE TREES

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:04.301
ARE COLLECTED --

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:05.235
AND IN A MONIES DISTRIBUTED

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:06.403
THERE'S ABOUT FIFTY DIFFERENT.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.739
DO WE HAVE A PRIORITY ORDER OR

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:11.308
IS IT.

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:14.945
SO IT IS SELF FIFTY I

00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:15.612
LEGISLATION.

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:16.213
THERE THERE COULD BE MORE WE

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:16.847
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE COULD BE

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:17.848
MORE -- THE

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.883
PRIORITY KICKS AND WHEN PAYMENT

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.051
ISN'T.

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:24.154
PROVIDED IN FULL --

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:26.757
AND SO TO GET IT SO TO GIVE ANY

00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:28.692
AS RESTITUTION.

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:29.960
THE SECONDS KIND OF WITH A

00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:32.396
SECOND PRIORITY ORDER IS COSTS

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:34.297
RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.532
DELINQUENT THAT AND THERE'S A

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.501
COST RECOVERY PROCESS.

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:39.403
THAT'S AND THAT'S IN PLACE --

00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:40.871
AND THEN THEIR SUBSEQUENT ORDERS

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.806
AS WELL AND THERE ABOUT FIVE

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:44.741
TEARS IN TOTAL AND ALMOST ALL OF

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:45.609
THE FINES AND FEES THAT ARE

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:47.511
CHARGED WILL FALL INTO ONE OF

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:48.712
THOSE.

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:51.081
FIVE CATEGORIES AND SO ONE OF

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:52.983
THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT --

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.751
OUR SYSTEM ON THE COLLECTION

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:57.554
SIDE IS THAT NEITHER THE COURTS

00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:58.989
NOR THE COUNTIES HAVE.

00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:01.491
THE GREATEST FISCAL INCENTIVES

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:02.659
TO COLLECT SO I THINK THAT'S

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:03.794
THAT'S ONE THING ON ON THE

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.295
REVENUE SIDE THAT'S THAT'S

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:06.430
DIFFERENT FROM THE POLICY WE'RE

00:51:06.496 --> 00:51:07.664
NOT WEIGHING IN ON THE POLICY

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.166
THAT'S A DECISION --

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.768
FOR LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS --

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:13.303
TO MAKE.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.638
PART OF THAT RATIONALE AS AS YOU

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:16.306
GO DOWN THE PRIORITY LIST IF

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:17.741
YOU'RE AT THE BOTTOM YOU'RE IN

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.676
THE LOWER PRIORITY AS THINGS ARE

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:20.977
COMING OFF THE TOP.

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.813
IT MIGHT MEAN THAT YOU DON'T GET

00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:24.481
YOUR FULL THE FULL AMOUNT THAT

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:25.849
WAS ASSESSED.

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:27.484
RELATED TO THE FINER FEE THAT

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.919
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET AND

00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:30.020
GAIN FROM.

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:32.622
AND SO THAT REDUCES SOME OF THE

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:33.990
THE FISCAL AND SENT.

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.826
TO THE OTHER PIECE ON ON KIND OF

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:38.161
COLLECTIONS IS THAT.

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:41.231
THERE REALLY WASN'T INCENTIVE.

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.166
TO COLLECT WHEN DAD WAS NON

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.935
DELINQUENT SO THIS IS BEFORE ALL

00:51:45.001 --> 00:51:47.404
OF THE VARIOUS TOOLS THAT THE

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:48.738
STATE HAS AUTHORIZED THESE ARE

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:50.574
THINGS LIKE BEFORE IT WAS THE

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.476
DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION --

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:55.445
WAGE GARNISHMENT SELENE'S AND SO

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:56.947
ONE OF THINGS THAT WE FOUND WAS

00:51:57.013 --> 00:51:58.215
THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT

00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.382
COURTS COULD DO COURTS IN

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:00.517
COUNTIES COULD DEAL AND SOME OF

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.452
THEM WERE DOING IT --

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:04.087
TO HELP INDIVIDUALS STAY ON

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:05.889
TRACK THESE INCLUDED THINGS LIKE

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:07.958
PAYMENT REMINDERS TO SOMETIMES

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.493
IF YOU GET A UTILITY BILL ALL

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:10.527
RIGHT YOU'LL GET A LITTLE NOTICE

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:12.329
SAYING YOU OWE THIS MUCH.

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:12.963
AND SO THEY IS SOME COURTS AND

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:14.297
COUNTIES FOUNDED THAT WAS REALLY

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:15.265
REALLY HELPFUL.

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:17.167
BUT COSTS RELATED TO NON

00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:18.668
DELINQUENT COLLECTIONS WHICH IS

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:20.303
BEHAVIOR WE POTENTIALLY WOULD

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.171
WANT.

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.373
ON SAMPLE SIZE WASN'T

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.408
RECOVERABLE UNDER THE CURRENT

00:52:25.475 --> 00:52:27.110
STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE --

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:28.378
RELATED TO DON'T COLLECTING

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:30.046
DELINQUENT PAYMENTS.

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:30.881
AND SO THAT SORT OF IT IN A

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:31.848
NUTSHELL I MEAN I THINK THERE

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:33.550
ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE FOUND

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:34.551
BUT HOPEFULLY THAT ADDRESSES

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:35.619
YOUR QUESTION.

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.487
OKAY AND IN THE LAST WHEN YOU.

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:39.089
YOU YOU MENTIONED ABOUT.

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:41.057
HAVING THESE FINES AND FEES GO

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:43.627
INTO THE GENERAL FUND WITH WITH

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:45.195
THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:47.130
WE WOULD RE PROGRAM THIS MONEY

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:50.033
BACK INTO PUBLIC SAFETY ONLY AND

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.201
TO COLONEL JESS THAT THERE WOULD

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.068
BE DIVERTED TO TRANSPORTATION

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:57.040
OUR SCHOOLS SAID IT WOULD STAY.

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:58.608
HOPEFULLY WITHIN.

00:52:58.675 --> 00:53:01.811
PER VIEW OF PUBLIC SAFETY OR IT

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:02.913
BAR GOES A GENERAL FUND AND

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:03.380
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

00:53:03.446 --> 00:53:04.514
THERE ARE MULTI THEIR MULTIPLE

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:07.484
REASONS FOR OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.685
TO PAUSE INTO THE GENERAL FUND.

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:12.522
THE FIRST MAJOR RATIONALE FOR

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.124
THAT IS THAT.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.126
OVER TIME VARIOUS CRIMINAL FINES

00:53:16.192 --> 00:53:17.427
AND FEES HAVE BEEN ADDED ON FOR

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:19.796
A WHOLE VARIETY OF PROCESS THESE

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:21.665
AND FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS.

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:22.899
THE AMOUNT WHAT THEY DO

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:25.802
BASICALLY THEIR OP PENDANTS ON

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:27.337
THE AMOUNT OF FINING FEE REVENUE

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.905
THAT'S COMING AND IT WAS NEVER

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.674
REALLY MATCHED UP TO THE SERVICE

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:31.575
LEVEL.

00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:32.576
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:33.977
EXPECTING.

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:36.212
AND SO PART ONE OF THE REASONS

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:37.380
FOR THAT IS THEN ESSENTIALLY TO

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:39.983
DE COUPLE THAT RATIONALE AND SO

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:40.617
THEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD FOCUS

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:43.186
ON WHAT PROGRAM WE'RE TALKING

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:44.554
ABOUT HOW IT WHAT ARE OUR

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:46.423
EXPECTATIONS FOR THAT PROGRAM

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.191
AND HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST. TO

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:48.725
LIVE IT TO DELIVER THOSE

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:50.493
SERVICES IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.028
ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE BUDGET

00:53:52.095 --> 00:53:52.762
SIDE.

00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:53.730
MISTER CHAIR YOU'LL YOU'LL BE

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:54.731
HAVING THAT AS PART OF YOUR

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:56.366
BUDGET DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE OVER

00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:59.035
TIME WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF

00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:00.804
PROGRAMS --

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:03.540
AND FUNDS ENTERING INTO KIND OF

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:04.874
INSOLVENCY OUR OPERATION

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:06.142
SHORTFALL BECAUSE AMOUNT OF FINE

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:07.477
AND FEE REVENUE THAT'S BEEN

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:08.778
COMING AND HAS BEEN DECLINING.

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:10.213
THE STATE'S TAKEN A VARIETY OF

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.881
DIFFERENT ACTIONS INCLUDING BACK

00:54:11.948 --> 00:54:13.550
FILLING SOME OF THEM SHIFTING

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:14.517
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS TO THE

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:16.286
GENERAL FIND AND ALSO

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:19.789
IMPLEMENTING REDUCTIONS.

00:54:19.856 --> 00:54:22.192
SO THAT'S KIND OF ONE PIECE.

00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:23.193
THE SECOND ASPECT IS.

00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:24.461
BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS VERY

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:26.796
COMPLEX PROCESS FOR DISTRIBUTING

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:27.831
TO ALL OF THE STATE AND LOCAL

00:54:27.897 --> 00:54:28.765
FINDS.

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:31.167
SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:33.269
LOOKED AT AND EVALUATED BY THE

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:35.138
LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:36.506
AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:37.340
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:40.010
THESE PROGRAMS COME BEFORE THE

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:40.543
LEGISLATURE WHEN THERE'S A

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:41.444
PROBLEM.

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.545
ESSENTIALLY THAT THEY'RE RUNNING

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.714
OUT OF REVENUE AND OR YOU KNOW

00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:45.815
REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES ARE

00:54:45.882 --> 00:54:46.983
NOT MATCHED UP.

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.652
AND THAT REALLY LIMITS THE

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:50.487
LEGISLATURE'S ABILITIES IN TERMS

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:51.888
OF WHAT TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:52.722
ISSUE.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:54.491
THE CONCEPT IS BASICALLY IF YOU

00:54:54.557 --> 00:54:55.992
KNOW THE PROBLEM IS COMING --

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:57.560
YOU CAN POTENTIALLY IMPLEMENT

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:59.663
SOLUTIONS EARLIER ON THAT CAN

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:01.464
MAKE IT LESS PAINFUL TO

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:03.266
IMPLEMENT ESSENTIALLY --

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:04.901
IN TERMS OF THAN DEDICATING THE

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.936
FUNDING SPECIFICALLY TO PUBLIC

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.338
SAFETY THAT'S CERTAINLY

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:09.673
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.875
CAN TALK ABOUT --

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.910
IT'S EIGHT SIX IT'LL BE IN THE

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.211
GENERAL FUND SO THERE'S A

00:55:15.278 --> 00:55:16.312
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:17.781
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.115
DEDICATE A CERTAIN PART OF

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:23.119
PORTION OF THAT MONEY. TO PLEASE

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:25.355
BUT FOR US WE THINK THAT IT IS A

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:26.723
DECISION FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.558
AMONGST ALL OF ITS GENERAL FUND

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:29.459
PRIORITIES.

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:31.261
WE DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:32.696
THEIR VARIOUS RATIONALES

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.130
CURRENTLY FOR HOW WE ASSESS

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.665
THESE FINES AND FEES.

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:36.933
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:37.600
RECOMMENDATION ABOUT

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.202
CONSOLIDATING MOST OF THE FINES

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:41.337
AND FEES THE LEGISLATURE CONSENT

00:55:41.404 --> 00:55:42.505
THOSE FINES AND FEES BASED ON

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:44.708
WHAT GOALS THEY WANT TO ME.

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:46.376
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE GOAL IS

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:49.579
DETERRENCE THAT CAN BE ONE FEE.

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:52.015
IF FOR WAR FINE IF THE GOAL IS

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:54.150
TO OFFSET THE IMPACTS OF

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:55.785
WHATEVER THE BEHAVIOR AS IT CAN

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:57.320
BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:58.822
GOALS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.523
BUT IT'S HOPEFUL TO HAVE

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:01.958
DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:03.359
ABOUT WHAT THE LAW WHAT THE

00:56:03.426 --> 00:56:05.161
POLICY DIRECTION POLICY

00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:07.397
RATIONALE IS FOR THESE FINES AND

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:10.800
FEES.

MOST IMPORTANT WORK HERE BECAUSE

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:05.188
WE TRIED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM IS

DOLLAR BASE.

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:15.832
FINE -- IT

YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:34.350

PEOPLE DEPEND UPON THEM I DO

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:46.863
REMEMBER WHEN THE EMS PENALTY

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.898
ASSESSMENT CAME UP AND SAID IS

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.200
THE CHAIR.

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:52.302
THE DIFFICULTY WAS SO WHICH TWO

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:54.304
DOLLARS FOR EVERY TEN OF BASS

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.472

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:58.308
THE ONLY.

00:57:58.374 --> 00:57:59.943
ENHANCEMENT WE HAD IT MIGHT NOT

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:02.846
BE SO BAD BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.280
YOU MENTIONED IT'S ONE OF MANY.

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:05.648
THE DIFFICULTY.

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:06.082
AND EVEN --

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:09.853
THE AS CHAIR AT THE TIME MELISSA

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.588
MELENDEZ --

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:13.857
SAID THAT GEE THIS IS NOT JUST

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.558
OUR FEES ARE TOO HIGH AND I

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:17.260
AGREE WITH THAT BUT THE PROBLEM

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:19.796
WAS IF WE DIDN'T EXTENDED.

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:22.465
THEN THE PEOPLE IN EMS THIS WAS

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:25.902
A MAJOR PART OF THEIR FUNDING --

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:29.806
SO THE FIREMEN WERE HERE AND

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:31.107
OTHER --

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.175
AMBULANCE COMPANIES WERE HERE

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:33.810
AND IT WE REALLY NEED THIS AND

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:35.111
PARTICULARLY WAS FIRE AND

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:37.547
THEY'RE VERY HARD TO SAY NO.

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:39.515
TO SO THE AND I'M SURE THAT THE

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:41.317
COURTS WOULD COMPLAIN IF WE TAKE

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:42.952
OFF ANY OF THESE --

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:46.389
THE COUNTIES WILL COMPLAIN --

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.558
I THINK.

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:49.826
THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE VERY

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:52.462
HARD TO DO BECAUSE ALL OF THESE

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:55.832
ARE HERE FOR YOU NOW REASONABLE.

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:57.267
WELL MAYBE NOT ALL OF THEM BUT

00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:58.835
MANY OF THEM ARE HERE BECAUSE

00:58:58.902 --> 00:59:02.038
THEY SUPPORT GOOD CAUSES --

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:03.406
AND THE COUNTY CERTAINLY WON'T

00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:05.208
TRUST ISSUE THAT GOES TO THE

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:07.176
GENERAL FUND ELSE CREAM SO WILL

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:10.179
THE COURTS SO WELL EMS.

00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:12.081
THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING IS

00:59:12.148 --> 00:59:14.150
FRANKLY THERE OUGHT TO BE A BASE

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:15.718
THE PERIOD.

00:59:15.785 --> 00:59:16.319
IT OUGHT TO GO TO THE GENERAL

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:18.288
FUND AND THEN WE SHOULD PAY

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:20.023
THESE OTHER THINGS BUT I DON'T

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:21.224
KNOW THAT ANY OF THE GROUPS THAT

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.026
GET ANY OF THIS MONEY WILL TRUST

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.193

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.096
SEND IT BACK TO THEM SO.

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:28.765
THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY WE FACE

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:30.800
AND I'M MENTIONING THIS FOR THE

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:33.236
EDUCATION OF OUR NEW MEMBERS WE

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:36.239
HAVE TWO NEW THIS YEAR AND

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:38.308
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE FACE.

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:39.876
I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO LOOK AT

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:41.511
A RADICAL SOLUTION BUT IT'S

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:43.646
GONNA BE TOUGH [inaudible]

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.549
THANK.

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:48.451
THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:51.587
ON THE BENEFITS IS PRETTY CLEAR

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:53.156
WHO'S BENEFITING FROM ALL THESE

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:54.123
FINES AND FEES --

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:55.491

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:56.993
HERE ON THE COLLECTION PROGRAM

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.561
WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL COSTS

00:59:58.628 --> 00:59:59.595
THAT GO INTO COLLECTING THESE

00:59:59.662 --> 01:00:01.064
FEES AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.434
WITH THE BENEFIT.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.602
COULD YOU CLARIFY ON COULD YOU

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.571
PLEASE CLARIFY I'M NOT QUITE

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:09.706
SURE IN TERMS OF THE ADDITIONAL

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:11.074
COSTS SO I ASSUME THE COUNTIES

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.076
BEAR ADDITIONAL COST BEYOND JUST

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:15.611
THE 7% OF COLLECTION PROGRAMS

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:16.446
ARE NOT GOING TO COLLECTING THE

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:17.513
SKIS -- YES

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.816
SO THE 7% THAT YOU HAVE

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.417
HIGHLIGHTED THAT IS THE COURT

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:23.486
AND COUNTY COSTS FOR COLLECTING

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:24.887
WHEN IT'S DELINQUENT --

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:27.123
SO THERE ARE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.458
BOTH SIDES WHEN THEY'RE

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.759
COLLECTING --

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.527
WHEN IT'S NON DELINQUENT AND SO

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:35.298
THEY ME IN COURT IN QUESTION AND

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:38.067
WHAT THE AGREEMENT IS BETWEEN

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:39.569
THE TWO OF THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE?

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:41.504
THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTIES WHERE

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.072
THE COURT COLLECTS EVERYTHING.

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:44.440
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:46.109
COUNTIES WHERE THE COURT

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:49.712
COLLECTS. 80% OF IT AND THEN THE

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.147
COUNTY COLLECTS UP ANOTHER

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:52.315
PORTION OF IT I THINK ONE OF THE

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.516
ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE HAD

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:54.784
HEARD MOST FREQUENTLY.

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:55.985
WAS THAT --

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:56.986
FOR EXAMPLE THE COUNTY WOULD

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:59.022
COLLECT THE PROBATION FEES --

01:00:59.088 --> 01:00:59.655
IT BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE WOULD

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.824
MORE DIRECTLY GO TO LIKE THE

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.893
PROBATION DEPARTMENT ETCETERA --

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.528
WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT IDEA OF

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:07.597
HOW MUCH THEY'RE PUTTING INTO

01:01:07.663 --> 01:01:09.399
THAT WE'VE HEARD ON A PIECEMEAL

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.067
BASIS THAT IT CAN RANGE FROM

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.135
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.169
SOMETIMES EVEN IN THE MILLIONS

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:15.471
OF DOLLARS.

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:16.873
I THINK WHEN WE LOOKED --

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.207
SO BEFORE THE REPORT THAT THE

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:20.877
TERM MENTIONS IN 200-015-2000

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.211
SIXTEEN WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON THE

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:23.713
DISTRIBUTION AND ASSESSMENT WE

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:24.580
ACTUALLY DID A REPORT ON THE

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.782
COLLECTION SIDE.

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.250
AS WELL AND SO --

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:28.051
SOME OF THINGS THAT I WAS

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:28.985
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:30.787
LACK OF FISCAL INCENTIVES TO

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.455
COLLECT THAT WAS --

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:33.823
THAT RESULTED FROM THAT REPORT

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.291
INTO SPECIFICALLY IN RELATION TO

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.392
YOUR QUESTION.

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.994
IT WAS THAT ISSUE FOR US IN

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.462
TERMS OF THERE ARE THINGS THAT

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.397
WERE BEING DONE ON THE DON'T NON

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.166
DELINQUENT SIDE THAT IF YOU'RE

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.434
GOING TO OPERATE A COLLECTIONS

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.102
PROGRAM THE STATE'S DECIDED THAT

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.937
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO --

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:50.173
YOU'D PROBABLY WANT TO KIND OF

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:52.542
REWARD THAT BEHAVIOR IN AN

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:54.110
INCENTIVE STRUCTURE AND OUR

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.545
CURRENT IN STOCK INCENTIVE

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:56.746
STRUCTURE DOESN'T DO THAT.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.848
THERE WERE SCENARIOS ACTUALLY

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:00.283
WHEN WE'RE MODELING IT THAT

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:01.751
THERE WERE COUNTY IS THAT

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.252
INVESTED IN THAT COUNTIES

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.053
REPORTS I WOULD INVEST IN THAT

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.155
WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY BE PUNISHED

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:06.956
ESSENTIALLY.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:08.458
BECAUSE THEY WERE COLLECTING

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:10.593
ALAS DELINQUENT DADS AND SO THEY

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:14.163
WERE ABLE TO RECOVER LESSEN

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:18.401
THEIR COSTS.

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:19.635
JUST IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.604

FINES AND FEES ARE THERE SOME OF

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.689
THEM THAT ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.491
THAT ARE THEY'RE MET BY THIS.

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:43.426
IT WILL VERY --

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.595
SO ON ONE SIDE UP TO A FEW YEARS

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:46.629
AGO -- I

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.998
WILL GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF POST

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.533

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.434
THE DOLLARS THAT ARE USED TO

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.602
SUPPORT THE PEACE OFFICER

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:53.970
STANDARDS ON COMMISSION UP TO A

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:56.239
FEW YEARS AGO THEY WERE SOLELY

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.341
FUNDED BY FINANCIER REVENUE --

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.709
AS A KIND OF REFERENCE TO MY

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.077
COMMENTS THE AMOUNT OF FINE AND

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:02.178
HE REVENUE THAT HAS BEEN COMING

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:03.980
AND HAS BEEN COLLECTED OVER TIME

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.381
HAS BEEN DECREASING.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.450
AND SO THE STATE THROUGH THE

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:08.818
BUDGET PROCESS HAD TO TAKE

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.453
ACTION --

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.921
BECAUSE THEY HAD IMPLEMENTED

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:12.955
REDUCTIONS THE STATE WASN'T AND

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:14.423
HE WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE SERVICE

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:15.658
LEVEL THAT WAS BEING PROVIDED

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:16.726
AND SO ULTIMATELY THE STATE

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:18.461
DECIDED TO PUT IN GENERAL FUND

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.428
DOLLARS.

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:21.097
THERE'S ACTUALLY PROPOSAL THIS

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:23.499
YEAR AGAIN RELATED TO POST

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:25.368
ANOTHER ONE KIND OF IN THAT VEIN

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:27.703
IS THE STATE'S DNA --

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.439
LAPS AND THAT'S OPERATED BY DOJ

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:31.607
AND SO THEY TRADITIONALLY WERE

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:33.142
FUNDED BY KIND OF FIND FEE

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:34.110
REVENUE AS WALL.

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:35.244
COME ON THE FLIP SIDE THEN YOU

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:39.215
HAVE TRIAL COURTS --

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:39.715
FOR EXAMPLE TRIAL COURT

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:42.952
OPERATIONS IS FINE IF YOU'RE

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:43.853
EVAN AS THEY GET A PORTION OF IT

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.221
BUT THEY'RE ALSO SUPPORTED BY

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.423
THE GENERAL FUND CIVIL FILING

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.892
FEES ON THE PAN THE CIVIL SIDE.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:52.094
AS WELL AS THIS OUTSTANDING

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.429
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COUNTIES

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:54.096
IN COURTS IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:56.399
THE COUNTY IS PROVIDE TO SUPPORT

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.868
THE COURTS SO DOES IT VERY --

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.603
AND IT IT SUBJECT TO KIND OF

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.206
DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:08.878
ACTIONS TO TAKE.

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:09.812
YEAH I WAS JUST WONDERING DO YOU

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:11.047
HAVE ANY IDEA WHY --

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:12.348
THE REASON BEHIND THE COMPLEXITY

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:13.783
BASE FIND PERCENTAGES WHICH VERY

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:15.851
FROM CITY TO CITY AND COUNTY

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.086
COUNTING.

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:20.523
I AM I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.124
RATIONALE BEHIND THE

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.960
DISTRIBUTION I THINK IT GOES

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.128
BACK TO HISTORICAL TIMES I THINK

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:28.097
MAYBE PERFORMED FOR FOR ME --

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.198
AND AS PART OF OUR RESEARCH I

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.766
DON'T THINK I WAS EVER ABLE TO

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:33.703
KIND OF ASCERTAIN SPECIFICALLY.

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:35.404
HOW THOSE WERE ACHIEVED AND SO

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:36.239
THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS IN THE

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.974
AUDIENCE WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.508

CONTEXT IS THIS QUITE

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.945
COMPLICATED AND VERY SPORTY

VIOLATED AND SENT BACK TO JAIL

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.957

REPRESENTED IN THE SYSTEM DUE TO

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:10.552
RACIAL BIAS AT EVERY STAGE OF

THESE FEES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:33.876
COLLECTING REVENUE BUT ABOUT

FIND IN FEES DO NOT ENHANCE

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:42.618
PUBLIC SAFETY.

RATHER THEY MAKE IT EXTREMELY

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:45.954
DIFFICULT FOR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.956

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.022

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:30.157
THE SHERIFF ELIMINATE TO FEES IN

BEFORE THE BOOK BOARDED EVEN

01:35:33.694 --> 01:35:34.795
VOTED.

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:35.396
THE BOARD ASKED THE COURT TO

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:36.363

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:39.767
OUTSTANDING DEBT THIS IS PASSED.

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.435
SO LOSE RETROACTIVE FOR TWENTY

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:42.670
THOUSAND PEOPLE.

01:35:42.736 --> 01:35:44.004
THIS IS MONEY THAT WAS UNLIKELY

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:46.340
TO BE COLLECTED ANYWAY.

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:49.710

PAY.

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:53.047
RATHER THAN ELIMINATING THEM.

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:54.548
I BELIEVE THAT ELIMINATION IS

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:56.283
ONLY SOLUTION. FOR CRIMINAL

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:59.453
JUSTICE DEBT FOR SEVERAL REASONS

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.021
ONE ABILITY TO PAY PROVISIONS

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:02.890
ARE ALREADY IN THE LAW.

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:04.291
BUT IN MOST CASES THE COURTS

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:05.459
DON'T BOTHER TO MAKE THAT

01:36:05.526 --> 01:36:06.227
DETERMINATION.

01:36:06.293 --> 01:36:09.697
AND THERE'S NOT A HEARING --

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:10.731
YOU KNOW MANY OF THE FEES A

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:14.401

AGENCY TYPICALLY HAVE TO DEFEND

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:19.373
IT DOESN'T PAY.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.509
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CONSIDER

01:36:21.575 --> 01:36:24.278
ABILITY TO PAY. 8290% OF

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:25.446
CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS ARE ALREADY

01:36:25.513 --> 01:36:27.448
DETERMINED TO BE INDIGENT ANYWAY

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.016
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE A PUBLIC

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:29.984
DEFENDER.

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:31.785
DEBILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION

01:36:31.852 --> 01:36:33.187
HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE SO IT'S

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:34.288
NOT NECESSARY.

01:36:34.355 --> 01:36:36.290
AND ALMOST NO ONE CAN AFFORD

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:37.324
THESE FEES.

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:39.827
EVEN THE 15220% OF FEES THAT ARE

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:49.537
FINALLY BECAUSE A COLLECTION

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:54.608
IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF WHAT IS

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:55.776
COLLECTED.

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:56.977
TRULY IMPLEMENTING THE ABILITY

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:58.879

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.848
ADMINISTRATIVE COST.

ARE NOT ON THE BACKS OF THE POOR.

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:40.868
AND THAT THESE REFORMS CAN WORK

01:40:40.934 --> 01:40:42.569

STILL ON THE RECORDS OF TWENTY

01:41:54.208 --> 01:41:55.843
ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE.

01:41:55.909 --> 01:41:57.377
WE KNEW THIS WAS THAT WE WERE

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.112
NEVER GOING TO COLLECT IN FACT

01:41:59.179 --> 01:42:01.181
THE LARGEST FEE THAT WE WERE

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:03.317
COLLECTING HAD A PAYMENT RATE OF

01:42:03.383 --> 01:42:05.752
LESS THAN 10%.

01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:07.120
ALL THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:08.722
COLLECTIVELY DID AS A COUNTY ARE

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:10.390

FOR GOVERNMENT AND YOU ALL HAVE

01:42:19.833 --> 01:42:21.168
A COPY OF IT.

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:22.703
WE CREATED THE REPORT TO BE A

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:24.505
RESOURCE FOR OTHERS ACROSS THE

01:42:24.571 --> 01:42:25.906
COUNTRY WHO WANTED TO TAKE

01:42:25.973 --> 01:42:27.908
SIMILAR ACTION WE'VE BEEN

01:42:27.975 --> 01:42:29.142
GETTING CALLS FROM COUNTIES.

01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:32.346

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:33.514
WITH THE FINANCIAL JUSTICE

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.615
PROJECT WE WORKED WITH OUR

01:42:34.681 --> 01:42:36.216
DEPARTMENTS TO RECOMMEND THE

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:37.718
FEES AND FINES THAT CAN BE ALSO

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:39.152
PLACED ON A SLIDING SCALE OF

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:41.455
INCOME OR ABILITY TO PAY.

01:42:41.522 --> 01:42:43.056
OR ALLOW ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:45.125
LIKE COMMUNITY SERVICE.

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:46.693
CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.629
FEES AS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD ARE

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:50.297
UNIQUELY DIFFERENT WE WORK

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:51.765
DILIGENTLY FIND THE MOST REVENUE

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:53.767
NEUTRAL ALTERNATIVES LIKE HAVING

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:54.368
THESE.

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:56.336
FEES ON A SLIDING INCOME SCALE

01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:58.338
OR ABILITY TO PAY THE MORE WE

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:00.541
LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVES THE MORE

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:01.909
WE CAME TO ONE CONCLUSION.

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:04.077
THAT THESE FEES ARE HIGH PAYING

01:43:04.144 --> 01:43:05.412
FOR PEOPLE BUT LOW GAME FOR

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:06.446
GOVERNMENT AND THE CRIMINAL

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:07.981
JUSTICE FEES FOR CRIMINAL

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:09.616
JUSTICE FEES ELIMINATION IS THE

01:43:09.683 --> 01:43:12.352
BEST SOLUTION. FOR THESE REASONS

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:13.754
THE FEES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:14.955
ASSESSED ON VERY LOW INCOME

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:16.990
PEOPLE WHO CAN NOT A PAID FOR

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:18.125
THEM FOR THEM.

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:19.293
AS YOU FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:23.030
PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED HAVE

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:24.731
UNSTABLE HOUSING NO STEADY

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:26.133
SOURCE OF INCOME.

01:43:26.199 --> 01:43:28.302
AND FIND WORK DIFFICULT OR

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:30.103
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN.

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:32.172
AN EVALUATION OF THE PUBLIC

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:33.607
DEFENDER'S CLEAN SLATE PROGRAM.

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:35.309
FOUND THAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:36.510
OF THE CLEAN SLATE CLIENTS ARE

01:43:36.577 --> 01:43:38.412
UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE WHO WERE

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:39.546
EMPLOYED.

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:41.748
HAD A MEDIAN INCOME OF TWO

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:42.382
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:44.184
YEAR.

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:45.919
SO FEW PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO PAY

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:47.220
THEM THAT IT DOESN'T PENALIZE

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:48.889
PENCIL OUT TO CONDUCT AN ABILITY

01:43:48.956 --> 01:43:50.824
TO PAY DETERMINATION.

01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:52.125
THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:53.760
HAVING STAFF CONDUCTED ABILITY

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:55.562
TO PAY DETERMINATION ON DIDN'T

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:57.197
JUSTIFY THE REVENUE OUR

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:59.099
PROBATION CHIEF KAREN FLETCHER

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:00.534
SAID SHE WANT HER SHE DIDN'T

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:00.867
WANT.

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:02.402
HER PROBATION OFFERS DID NOT

01:44:02.469 --> 01:44:03.904
WANT TO SERVICE COLLECTION

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:05.839
OFFICERS THEY WEREN'T TRAINED TO

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:08.008
BE THAT.

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:09.910
THE COLLECTION RATES ON THESE

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:11.845
FEES AVERAGE ABOUT 17% WHEN

01:44:11.912 --> 01:44:13.280
YOU'RE LOOK AT ALL OF THEM --

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:15.215
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

01:44:15.282 --> 01:44:16.650
AS I SAID THE COLLECTION RATE

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:18.085
FOR THE LARGEST FEE WAS LESS

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:19.453
THAN 10%.

01:44:19.519 --> 01:44:21.121
AND FOR MORE THAN HALF THE FEES

01:44:21.188 --> 01:44:22.289
THE MONEY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:23.790
PROJECTED TO COME IN WITH SO

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:26.159
MINIMAL THAT IT WASN'T EVEN

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:28.028
ACCOUNTED FOR IN OUR BUDGET.

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:30.397
COMPARE THIS TO OUR MUNICIPAL

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:32.099
TRANSPORTATION AGENCY PARKING

01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:34.735
CITATION COLLECTION RATES WHICH

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.336
ARE ABOVE 90%.

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:37.337
OUR BUSINESS REGISTRATION

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:40.974
LICENSE FEES WHICH ARE 95%.

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:42.676
RESEARCH OF COLLECTION A SIMILAR

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:44.411
SOME JUVENILE JUSTICE

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:45.245
ADMINISTRATION FEES AND OTHER

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:45.779
COUNTIES.

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.581
SHOW THE COUNTIES OFTEN SPEND

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:49.316
MORE TO COLLECT THESE FEES THAN

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:51.885
THEY ACTUALLY BRING IN.

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:53.186
LET'S NOT FORGET THE FEES WE

01:44:53.253 --> 01:44:54.655
ELIMINATED ARE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:44:54.721 --> 01:44:55.656
FEES.

01:44:55.722 --> 01:44:57.324
THEIR GOALS ARE SIMPLY TO RECOUP

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:58.859
COST THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE AN

01:44:58.925 --> 01:45:02.229
ADDITIONAL LAYER OF PUNISHMENT.

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:03.597
THIRDLY THESE FEES ARE ALSO

01:45:03.664 --> 01:45:04.798
DIFFERENT IN THAT RESEARCH SHOWS

01:45:04.865 --> 01:45:05.832
THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:08.235
CONTRIBUTE TO RECIDIVISM AND

01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:09.870
CREATE BARRIERS TO ENTRY.

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:10.837
BECAUSE THESE FEES CAN BE

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:11.838
COLLECTED THROUGH WAGE

01:45:11.905 --> 01:45:13.273
GARNISHMENT AND BANK ACCOUNT

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.042
LEVIES THEY CAN DRIVE PEOPLE

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:16.610
TOWARD UNDERGROUND ECONOMIES.

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:18.078
AND CHARGING PEOPLE WITH SUCH

01:45:18.145 --> 01:45:19.813
LARGE BILLS CAN DRIVE PEOPLE TO

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:22.082
FIND SOLUTIONS TO COME UP WITH

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.684
LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH.

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:25.118
RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE WHITE

01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:26.386
HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:27.387
ADVISERS.

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:28.689
THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE

01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:30.590
AND OTHERS SHOWS THAT THESE FEES

01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:33.694
CAN CREATE BARRIERS TO ENTRY.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.262
AND ALL OF OUR SAN FRANCISCO

01:45:35.328 --> 01:45:36.563
CRIMINAL JUST JUST.

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:37.864
LEADERS ALL SUPPORTED THESE

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.900
REFORMS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:41.368
THESE REFORMS SUPPORT PEOPLE'S

01:45:41.435 --> 01:45:42.936
REENTRY.

01:45:43.003 --> 01:45:44.438
THAT'S GOING TO KEEP US SAFER AS

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:46.006
A CITY AND ALSO CAN BE MORE

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:48.875
EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG TERM.

01:45:48.942 --> 01:45:50.010
AND FINALLY OUR MAYORS BUDGET

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.378
OFFICE ESTIMATE IT THE BENEFITS

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:53.413
OF ELIMINATING THESE FEES FAR

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.815
OUTWEIGHS THE COSTS.

01:45:54.881 --> 01:45:56.817
WE ESTIMATED THAT ELIMINATION OF

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:57.718
THESE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:59.686
ADMINISTRATION FEES COSTS ARE

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:02.355
COUNTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A

01:46:02.422 --> 01:46:04.124
YEAR AND FOR GONE REVENUE.

01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:05.826
WE KNOW THAT'S REAL COST BUT

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:06.927
ELIMINATING THESE FEES AND

01:46:06.993 --> 01:46:08.995
OUTSTANDING DEBT LIFTED THIRTY

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.564
TIMES THAT THIRTY TWO MILLION

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:11.765
DOLLARS IN DEBT.

01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:12.332
OFF OF TWENTY ONE THOUSAND

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:15.168
INDIVIDUALS THAT'S AN INVESTMENT

01:46:15.235 --> 01:46:18.538
WITH A GREAT RETURN FOR OUR CITY.

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:19.906
WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT OUR WORK

01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:21.441
REFORMING CRIMINAL JUSTICE HE'S

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:23.810
I THINK ABOUT MERRY VANDERGRIFT.

01:46:23.877 --> 01:46:25.178
AFTER MERRY'S TIME IN JAIL SHE

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:27.347
GOT CLEAN FROM HER OBJECTION.

01:46:27.414 --> 01:46:28.615
SHE FOUND A NEW JOB A REUNITED

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:30.617
WITH THEIR DAUGHTER.

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:32.419
EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL.

01:46:32.486 --> 01:46:33.320
AND THEN WE HAD --

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:34.821
IT WITH A BILL FOR EIGHTEEN

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:36.790
HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PAY UP FRONT

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:37.357
FOR THREE YEARS OF PROBATION

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:39.326
FEES.

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:40.260
THIS CERTAINLY DIDN'T HELP

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:41.628
MERRY'S REENTRY INTO THE

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:42.863
COMMUNITY AND GET HER BACK ON

01:46:42.929 --> 01:46:43.830
HER FEET IN FACT JUST THE

01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:45.398
OPPOSITE.

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:46.633
AND THESE FEES DIDN'T WORK FOR

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.101
GOVERNMENT EITHER BECAUSE AS I

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:49.970
MENTIONED WE DON'T EVER RECOUP

01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:51.471
THE COST WE SPEND COLLECT THESE

01:46:51.538 --> 01:46:52.339
FEES.

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.740
WE NEED TO FIND MORE JUST AND

01:46:53.807 --> 01:46:55.842
SUSTAINABLE SOURCES OF REVENUE

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:56.476
TO PAY FOR OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:46:56.543 --> 01:46:57.878
SYSTEM.

01:46:57.944 --> 01:46:59.212
AND I'M PROUD OF THE WORK WE'RE

01:46:59.279 --> 01:47:00.914
STARTING TO DO IN CALIFORNIA AT

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:03.583
THIS LOCAL AND HOPEFULLY AT THE

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:03.917
STATE LEVEL.

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:04.885
GOVERNMENT WILL --

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.186
SHOULD BE AN EQUALIZER OF

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.755
OPPORTUNITY AND NOT A DRIVER OF

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:10.524
INEQUALITY THANK YOU.

01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:13.760
THANK YOU MISTER CISNEROS SO I

HALF OF THE TREASURES OKAY.

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:27.507
I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE.

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:28.375
ARE.

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:29.209
ANY OTHER QUICK QUESTIONS BEFORE

01:47:34.147 --> 01:47:34.948
ELECTED TREASURES.

01:47:35.015 --> 01:47:36.216
LANDERS I REALLY THINK THIS MORE

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:37.217
REFLECTS.

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:38.518
THE ATTITUDES IN THE COUNTY THAN

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:39.653
IT DOES WHETHER THEY'RE ELECTED

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:41.087

THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MORE

WIPED OUT.

01:48:30.503 --> 01:48:32.339
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS

01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:34.407
WHY THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT

01:48:34.474 --> 01:48:34.975

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:04.837
ARE REALLY JUST INTENDED TO HELP

01:54:04.904 --> 01:54:07.607
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RECOUP COSTS

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:08.841
AND IT COUNTIES OFTEN RECOVER

01:54:08.908 --> 01:54:10.610
ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF WHAT

01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:12.912
THEY A SASS. FOR EXAMPLE AS WE

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.147
HEARD IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY

01:54:14.214 --> 01:54:15.615
LESS THAN 10% OF SOME

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:16.749
ADMINISTRATIVE FEES WERE

01:54:16.816 --> 01:54:18.284
ACTUALLY COLLECTED.

01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:19.619
AND SUCH LOW RETURN RATES ARE

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.087
NOT THE RESULT OF LACKS

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:23.089
COLLECTION EFFORTS BECAUSE BUT

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:24.457
BECAUSE MOST SYSTEM INVOLVED

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:26.859
PEOPLE ARE LOW INCOME AND CANNOT

01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:28.661
AFFORD TO PAY THESE FEES. FOR

01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:30.964
EXAMPLE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY 84%

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:32.365
OF PEOPLE ON PROBATION HAD A

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:34.934
MONTHLY INCOME OF LESS THAN ONE

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:35.935
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:37.170
FURTHER COUNTY SPEND SIGNIFICANT

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:38.738
RESOURCES TRYING TO ASSESS AND

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:40.540
COLLECT FEES FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN

01:54:40.607 --> 01:54:43.810

TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEY

01:54:44.477 --> 01:54:46.246

HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:54:46.813 --> 01:54:47.680
COLLECTING ONLY TO FEES THE

01:54:47.747 --> 01:54:48.915
SUPERVISION AND DRUG TESTING

01:54:48.982 --> 01:54:50.817
FEES.

01:54:50.883 --> 01:54:51.751
BUT THESE THESE AREN'T JUST

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:53.519
COSTLY TO COUNTIES FEES CROWD

01:54:53.586 --> 01:54:55.221
OUT SPENDING ON POSITIVE SOCIAL

01:54:55.288 --> 01:54:56.256
GOODS SUCH AS HEALTHCARE AND

01:54:56.322 --> 01:54:58.424
EDUCATION WHICH ONLY IMPOSES

01:54:58.491 --> 01:54:59.425
HARM OVER TIME.

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:01.427
PROLONGS OR EXACERBATE POVERTY

01:55:01.494 --> 01:55:03.229
AND GENERATES COSTA FAMILIES

01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:04.964
COMMUNITIES AND SOCIETY.

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:07.967
IN THE ONLY STUDY OF ITS KIND AT

01:55:08.034 --> 01:55:09.102
TWENTY SIX ANALYSIS FOUND THAT

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:10.970
ELIMINATING JUVENILE FEES AND

01:55:11.037 --> 01:55:12.405
ONE COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:55:12.472 --> 01:55:13.740
RESULT IN A NET FINANCIAL

01:55:13.806 --> 01:55:16.009
BENEFIT TO SOCIETY A FIVE POINT

01:55:16.075 --> 01:55:17.910
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:55:17.977 --> 01:55:19.145
MOMENTUM IS BUILDING FOR FINES

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:20.913
AND FEES ARE FORM ESPECIALLY IN

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.015
CALIFORNIA AS WE COME OFF THE

01:55:22.081 --> 01:55:23.716
HEELS OF SB ONE NINETY WHICH

01:55:23.783 --> 01:55:25.118
MADE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE

01:55:25.184 --> 01:55:27.020
IN THE COUNTRY TO ELIMINATE FEES

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:28.454
IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM.

01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:29.856
AND WHILE MORE MORE COUNTIES ARE

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:31.491
DECIDING TO TAKE UP THIS ISSUE

01:55:31.557 --> 01:55:32.558
THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH

01:55:32.625 --> 01:55:34.193
THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP PLAY A

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.229
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ENDING THE

01:55:36.296 --> 01:55:37.664
HARM CAUSED BY THESE FEES.

01:55:37.730 --> 01:55:39.599
FIRST THE LEGISLATURE CAN STOP

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:41.000
THE CONTINUING HARM CAUSED TO

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:42.535
FAMILIES LIVING IN COUNTIES THAT

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:43.903
ARE STILL COLLECTING ON OLD

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.938
JUVENILE FEET AT LEGISLATION

01:55:46.005 --> 01:55:47.340
THAT WOULD REQUIRE COUNTIES TO

01:55:47.407 --> 01:55:49.208
AND COLLECTION AND DISCHARGE

01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:49.876
OLDER.

01:55:49.942 --> 01:55:51.577
OLD JUVENILE FEES WAS ORIGINALLY

01:55:51.644 --> 01:55:53.313
A PART OF SB ONE NINETY AND

01:55:53.379 --> 01:55:54.847
WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO FAMILIES

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.249
LIVING THE TWENTY TWO COUNTIES

01:55:56.316 --> 01:55:58.284
THAT ARE STILL ACTIVELY PURSUING

01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:59.786
JUVENILE FEE ACCOUNTS.

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:01.854
SECOND THE LEGISLATURE CAN LIMIT

01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:03.489
THE ROLE THAT THE STATE PLAYS

01:56:03.556 --> 01:56:04.957
PARTICULARLY THE FRANCHISE TAX

01:56:05.024 --> 01:56:06.259
BOARD IN THE ONGOING COLLECTION

01:56:06.326 --> 01:56:08.895
OF PREVIOUSLY SS JUVENILE FEES.

01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:10.163
BY ENDING LOCAL AUTHORITY TO

01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:11.798
CHARGE NEW JUVENILE FEES WITH

01:56:11.864 --> 01:56:13.533
THE SIGNING OF SB ONE NINETY

01:56:13.599 --> 01:56:15.068
CALIFORNIA MADE CLEAR THAT THESE

01:56:15.134 --> 01:56:16.469
FEES ARE HARMFUL AN AGGRESSIVE.

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:17.570
AND YET STATE RESOURCES ARE

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:18.838
STILL BEING PUT TOWARDS

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:21.974
COLLECTION OF THESE FEES IN

01:56:22.041 --> 01:56:23.176
THOSE TWENTY TWO COUNTIES.

01:56:23.242 --> 01:56:23.776
THIRD OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN

01:56:23.843 --> 01:56:24.711
ELIMINATE COUNTY AUTHORITY TO

01:56:24.777 --> 01:56:25.878
CHARGE FEES TO ADULTS IN THE

01:56:25.945 --> 01:56:27.447
JUSTICE SYSTEM JUST LIKE IT DID

01:56:27.513 --> 01:56:29.615
WITH JUVENILE FEES AN SP.

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:30.283
ONE NINETY ENDING THE ASSESSMENT

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:31.784
OF THESE HE'S WILL ADVANCE

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.653
PUBLIC SAFETY OR MITIGATING THE

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.288
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT SUCH

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:37.190
COST CURRENTLY IMPOSE ON

01:56:37.256 --> 01:56:39.025
INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES.

01:56:39.092 --> 01:56:40.393
FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.961
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FULL RANGE OF

01:56:42.028 --> 01:56:43.663
COSTS THAT MAKE REENTRY FOR

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:44.964
FORMER SYSTEM INVOLVED

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:46.265
INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUALS NEARLY

01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:47.533
IMPOSSIBLE.

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.735
WE'VE SEEN THE RELIEF THAT YOUNG

01:56:48.801 --> 01:56:50.570
PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE

01:56:50.636 --> 01:56:51.838
HAD UNDER SB.

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:53.206
ONE NINETY BUT QUITE OFTEN FOR

01:56:53.272 --> 01:56:53.773
YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE JUVENILE

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.875
SYSTEM.

01:56:55.942 --> 01:56:56.876
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT

01:56:56.943 --> 01:56:58.544
THEY'RE STILL FACING FINES AND

01:56:58.611 --> 01:57:00.847
RESTITUTION SO FEES ARE REALLY

01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:02.548
ONLY ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.

01:57:02.615 --> 01:57:04.217
CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

01:57:04.283 --> 01:57:05.451
TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THIS COUNTRY

01:57:05.518 --> 01:57:06.552
ON FINES AND FEES.

01:57:06.619 --> 01:57:08.221
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION THE

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:09.322

01:57:14.494 --> 01:57:15.328
WAITED IN.

01:57:15.395 --> 01:57:16.929
AND THEY ALL AGREED THAT WE MUST

01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:18.865
ELIMINATE AND REDUCED FINES AND

01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:19.899
FEES.

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:21.000
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO LIVE UNDER

01:57:21.067 --> 01:57:22.635
THE ILLUSION THAT MAKING FEES

01:57:22.702 --> 01:57:24.103
AND FINES PROPORTIONATE TO THE

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:25.838
ALLEGED CRIME OR RIGHT SIZING

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:27.573
PAYMENT IS ANYTHING BUT

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.675
EXACERBATING PERPETUATE EXISTING

01:57:29.742 --> 01:57:31.177
RACIAL INEQUITIES.

01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:32.345
BY INTRODUCING MONEY INTO THE

01:57:32.412 --> 01:57:33.746
JUSTICE SYSTEM WE'VE PERVERTED

01:57:33.813 --> 01:57:35.548
OUR CONCEPTION OF WHAT IT MEANS

01:57:35.615 --> 01:57:37.350
TO HELP BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.

01:59:49.982 --> 01:59:51.384
TO DO SO --

01:59:51.450 --> 01:59:53.185
ALSO IN NETWORK --

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:54.520
WE WERE ABLE --

01:59:54.587 --> 01:59:56.355
TO ADVOCATE IN HAVE ABILITY TO

01:59:56.422 --> 01:59:58.424
PAY BE SOMETHING EXISTS IN EVERY

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:02.695
SUPERIOR COURT IN CALIFORNIA --

02:00:02.762 --> 02:00:06.032
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WORK WHY

02:00:06.098 --> 02:00:07.266
ABILITY PAY --

02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:09.235
IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE OR EFFICIENT

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:11.237
SOLUTION SO CURRENTLY YOU GET A

02:00:11.304 --> 02:00:13.406
TRAFFIC TICKET IN THEORY EVERY

02:00:13.472 --> 02:00:15.575
COUNTY COURT IN CALIFORNIA SO

02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:17.076
SEVEN ABILITY PAY PROCESS LOOKS

02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:18.611
EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY

02:00:18.678 --> 02:00:19.512
TO COUNTY.

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:20.846
SO ALAMEDA COUNTY --

02:00:20.913 --> 02:00:22.381
BECAUSE WE'RE ABLE TO ADVOCATE

02:00:22.448 --> 02:00:23.215
ON THE GROUND WE OWE TO PUSH

02:00:23.282 --> 02:00:24.917
ALAMEDA COUNTY --

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.285
TO HAVE A OF PAY ME PROCESS

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:28.020
WHERE IF YOU QUALIFIED YOU GOT A

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:29.655
50% REDUCTION FOR MOST PEOPLE TO

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:31.691
A 50% REDUCTION STILL NOT ENOUGH

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:33.326
FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY THE TO BE

02:00:33.392 --> 02:00:33.759
TO MAKE PAYMENTS.

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:36.062
ON THAT ABILITY PAY PROCESS WAS

02:00:36.128 --> 02:00:37.863
ACTUALLY BASED ON A 125% OF THE

02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:39.265
FEDERAL POVERTY LINE WHICH IS

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:41.701
ROUGHLY TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.069
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR --

02:00:43.135 --> 02:00:45.504
FOR REFERENCE THE AVERAGE MEDIAN

02:00:45.571 --> 02:00:47.673
INCOME ALAMEDA COUNTY IS ABOUT A

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:48.507
HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

02:00:48.574 --> 02:00:50.176
FOR BLACK FOLKS IN PARTICULAR

02:00:50.242 --> 02:00:51.110
IT'S UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND

02:00:51.177 --> 02:00:51.711
DOLLARS.

02:00:51.777 --> 02:00:53.379
SO LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO

02:00:53.446 --> 02:00:54.947
PUSH THE COURT TO ADOPT THE HOOD

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:56.515
STANDARD WHICH IS THE CLOSEST

02:00:56.582 --> 02:00:57.583
THING -- TO

02:00:57.650 --> 02:01:00.086
AREA MEDIAN INCOME AND COST --

02:01:00.152 --> 02:01:01.120
UNFORTUNATELY THE COURT ON THE

02:01:01.187 --> 02:01:02.955
ADOPTED THE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

02:01:03.022 --> 02:01:03.923
STANDARD BUT THAT WAS

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:05.391
APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:06.792
DOLLARS MORE THAN THE FEDERAL

02:01:06.859 --> 02:01:08.327
POVERTY LINE SO THAT WOULD BRING

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:09.595
MORE PEOPLE.

02:01:09.662 --> 02:01:10.796
INTO THIS ABILITY PAY PROCESS

02:01:10.863 --> 02:01:12.598
WILL STILL IS AN INDICATION OF

02:01:12.665 --> 02:01:14.667
JUST HOW BROKE IN IT IS --

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.302
IN OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTY CONTRA

02:01:16.369 --> 02:01:17.470
COSTA COUNTY WE HAD CLIENTS WHO

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:18.971
CAME TO OUR CLINIC WHO WERE

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:20.406
APPROVED FOR THE ABILITY TO PAY

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:23.275
PROCESS AND FOR INSTANCE WERE

02:01:23.342 --> 02:01:28.414
GIVING COMMUNITY SERVICE --

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:29.482
IN OUR OPINION COMMUNITY

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:30.483
SERVICES ACTUALLY INDENTURED

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:31.651
SERVITUDE BECAUSE WHILE THE

02:01:31.717 --> 02:01:32.518
ASKING --

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:34.487
POOR FOLKS TO PERFORM COMMUNITY

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:35.054
SERVICE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:36.088
CANNOT PAY BECAUSE THIS IS A

02:01:36.155 --> 02:01:37.323
MANIFESTATION OF RACIALIZED

02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:37.757
POLICING --

02:01:37.823 --> 02:01:39.258
WE'RE MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT LOW

02:01:39.325 --> 02:01:40.292
INCOME COMMUNITIS OF COLOR WHO

02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:42.061
ARE BEING ASKED TO USE THEIR

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:43.729
LABOR TO PAY FOR THINGS --

02:01:43.796 --> 02:01:44.830
THIS ONE PARTICULAR CLIENT WAS

02:01:44.897 --> 02:01:46.966
GIVING EIGHTY HOURS OF COMMUNITY

02:01:47.033 --> 02:01:47.566
SERVICE.

02:01:47.633 --> 02:01:51.871
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THAT.

02:01:51.937 --> 02:01:53.606
WEEKS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE

02:01:53.673 --> 02:01:55.708
BECAUSE HE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.977
A TRAFFIC TICKET --

02:01:58.044 --> 02:01:59.478
FOR ME THAT IS --

02:01:59.545 --> 02:02:01.247
STRIKING PROOF THEY BOTH ABILITY

02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:02.348
TO PAY BECAUSE IT LOOKS

02:02:02.415 --> 02:02:03.683
DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:06.352
AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ARE NOT

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:08.721
ADEQUATE SOLUTIONS.

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:10.289
NUMBER IS MAKE ME LAWCENTER IS

02:02:10.356 --> 02:02:11.023
PART OF THE BACK OF THE WORLD

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:13.092
COALITION WAS ALSO ON THE THE

02:02:13.159 --> 02:02:15.361
LEADERS IN THE WORK AROUND

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:16.796
PARKING TICKET OR FORM --

02:02:16.862 --> 02:02:18.764
PRIOR TO THE BILL TWO YEARS

02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:20.232
PRIOR TO THAT WE ISSUE PUBLIC

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:21.867
RECORDS ACT REQUEST --

02:02:21.934 --> 02:02:23.069
FOR THE EIGHT LARGEST CITIES IN

02:02:23.135 --> 02:02:25.037
ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WE COULD SHOW

02:02:25.104 --> 02:02:27.973
THAT FOR INSTANCE IN OAKLAND THE

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.608
PHASE OF TICKETS MATT SQUARE THE

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:31.444
OVER THE OUTSTANDING DEBT --

02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:32.511
WE HAD CLIENTS WHO CAME MAIN WHO

02:02:32.578 --> 02:02:33.746
COULD NOT PAY THEIR PARKING

02:02:33.813 --> 02:02:35.281
TICKETS AND THEREFORE THEIR DMV

02:02:35.347 --> 02:02:37.116
REGISTRATION WAS WITH HAIL WHICH

02:02:37.183 --> 02:02:39.118
AGAIN BECAUSE THE WAY THAT --

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:40.019
POLICING HAPPENS MEANT THAT

02:02:40.086 --> 02:02:41.854
THOSE FOLKS WERE ALSO --

02:02:41.921 --> 02:02:43.155
AT RISK FOR GOING TO AN ON RAMP

02:02:43.222 --> 02:02:43.989
TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:45.391
IF YOU DON'T HAVE REGISTRATION

02:02:45.458 --> 02:02:46.826
YOUR VEHICLE BE PULLED OVER YOU

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:47.860
COULD END UP IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:53.632
SYSTEM OR HAVE YOUR VEHICLE TOLD.

02:02:53.699 --> 02:02:55.101
MOST RECENTLY --

02:02:55.167 --> 02:02:57.069
OR RATHER THE THE SUCCESS --

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:58.304
MOST RECENTLY WAS IN ALAMEDA

02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:58.971
COUNTY BEFORE BUT THAT WORK WAS

02:02:59.038 --> 02:03:00.306
ACTUALLY THREE YEARS IN THE

02:03:00.372 --> 02:03:01.407
MAKING SO WHEN I FIRST STARTED

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:02.308

HAVING THEIR WAGES GARNISHED BY

02:03:13.719 --> 02:03:14.887

02:03:14.954 --> 02:03:17.556
THEIR TAXES INTERCEPTED ACCEPT

02:03:17.623 --> 02:03:19.091

JUST HOW ABILITY PAY --

02:03:24.997 --> 02:03:27.333
WAS BROKEN SO LUCKILY FOR

02:03:27.399 --> 02:03:29.068
CLIENTS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:31.170
THEY WERE ABLE TO EXIT PROBATION --

02:03:31.237 --> 02:03:32.004
WHILE STILL ALLOWING THE SEAS

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:32.838
BUT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PAY

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:35.040
THESE FEES SO THEIR LIVES WERE

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:37.143
NOT ABLE TO CHANGE.

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:38.878
MOST RECENTLY --

02:03:38.944 --> 02:03:40.846

02:03:56.762 --> 02:03:57.396
NOT ENOUGH --

02:03:57.463 --> 02:03:58.297

THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABOUT THE

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:36.915
OFFSETTING OTHER FINES AND FEES

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:39.752
THOSE AREN'T DIRECTLY RELATED TO

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:41.153
THE THE BOMB PURPOSES OF

APPROACHING SOME OF THESE

02:07:54.433 --> 02:07:55.501
IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY

02:07:55.567 --> 02:07:57.036
DECISIONS.

02:07:57.102 --> 02:07:59.304
I THINK IS MISS LEE POINTED OUT --

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:00.639
COURT FILINGS HAVE GONE DOWN

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:02.174
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE COURSE OF

02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:03.475
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS --

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:04.943
THERE BEEN DIFFERENT POLICY

02:08:05.010 --> 02:08:06.311
REASONS FOR THAT HAVING HAPPENED

02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:07.679
AND I'LL I'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:08.981
IN A MINUTE --

02:08:09.048 --> 02:08:10.382
BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT

02:08:10.449 --> 02:08:11.450
TO NOTE THAT --

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:14.353
BECAUSE OF THAT THE COLLECTION

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:15.687
OF FINES AND FEES HAS HAS ALSO

02:08:15.754 --> 02:08:17.389
BEEN IMPACTED BY --

02:08:17.456 --> 02:08:19.191
BY THE REDUCTION IN THESE COURT

02:08:19.258 --> 02:08:20.392
FILINGS --

02:08:20.459 --> 02:08:22.461
AND SO AS A RESULT FUNDING FOR

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:23.362
SOME OF THESE IMPORTANT

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:25.497
GOVERNMENT SERVICES THAT THAT WE

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:33.772
IMPORTANT ISSUES.

SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THAT

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:41.080
CHANGED A LOT OF FELONIES TO

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:41.914
MISDEMEANORS.

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.449

HOUSE ONE HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF

02:09:27.659 --> 02:09:29.061
THINGS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS

THE TOOL THAT A THAT A JUDICIAL

02:10:13.038 --> 02:10:14.873

02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:29.488
MORE COUNTIES AND SO OUR HOPE IS

02:10:29.555 --> 02:10:31.156
THAT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WE

02:21:07.659 --> 02:21:09.527

THE HARD TIMES IT DIFFICULT

02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:11.722
BUDGET TIMES --

02:27:11.789 --> 02:27:13.791
THE GOVERNOR MADE A DECISION TO

02:27:13.858 --> 02:27:16.561
REALLY HAMPER THE CONSTRUCTION

02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:18.529
FUND AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:20.198
OF DOLLARS WERE TAKING OUT OF

02:27:20.264 --> 02:27:21.098
THAT.

02:27:21.165 --> 02:27:22.567
AND I'M NOT SURE TO STAY FOR WAS

02:27:22.633 --> 02:27:23.834
EVER.

02:27:23.901 --> 02:27:25.770
REPLENISHED --

02:27:25.836 --> 02:27:27.805
I'M GONNA ASSUME WE DIDN'T.

02:27:27.872 --> 02:27:29.440
WE DID LIVE UP TO OUR PROMISE

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:30.708
THAT WE WOULD GET REACHED MAKE

02:27:30.775 --> 02:27:32.109
YOU WHOLE AGAIN.

02:27:32.176 --> 02:27:33.177
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SUCH A

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:35.680
BIG CHASM IN IN BUNDY RIGHT NOW

02:27:35.746 --> 02:27:37.248
BECAUSE THE DURING HARD ECONOMIC

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:39.684
TIMES DECISIONS WERE MADE THAT

02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:41.886
WERE ADVERSE TO THE JUSTICES SO

02:27:41.953 --> 02:27:44.155
I'M I'M VERY SENSITIVE. TO

02:27:44.222 --> 02:27:45.823
MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER WE

02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:47.725
COME UP WITH A WHATEVER COMES TO

02:27:47.792 --> 02:27:50.428
OUR COMMITTEE THAT WE WE DON'T

02:27:52.863 --> 02:27:54.632
SAFETY APPARATUS.

02:27:54.699 --> 02:27:56.834
I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:59.303
POINT AND IT SHOWS THAT WHILE I

02:27:59.370 --> 02:28:01.339
WOULD SAY THAT.

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:02.907
CERTAINLY FIND TO TO HIGH WHAT

02:28:02.974 --> 02:28:05.243
THE RIGHT LEVEL IS I'M NOT SURE

02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:06.544
AND CERTAINLY --

02:28:06.611 --> 02:28:09.380
THESE FEES --

02:28:09.447 --> 02:28:11.515
WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT THEM.

02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:15.853
AND BUT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT.

02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:16.954
IS GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF

02:28:17.021 --> 02:28:18.723
TIME AND EFFORT WORK WITH THE

02:28:18.789 --> 02:28:20.358
GOVERNOR IT CETERA --

02:28:20.424 --> 02:28:23.394
I THINK IT'S WORTH WHILE FOR

02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:24.996
THOSE OF US IN THIS COMMITTEE.

02:28:25.062 --> 02:28:27.198
ARM TO THINK ABOUT --

02:28:27.265 --> 02:28:29.233
WHAT WE SHOULD DO WHAT THE

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.569

PRIOR -- BUT

02:28:53.724 --> 02:28:55.393

02:28:55.459 --> 02:28:57.995
FOR ME WHAT I THOUGHT GOING IN --

02:28:58.062 --> 02:28:59.630
BUT IS GIVEN MORE CONTEXT TO THE

02:28:59.697 --> 02:29:00.765
THE DISCRIMINATION AROUND THE

FINES AND FEES IN PARTICULAR

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:03.134
IMPACTING LOW INCOME.

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:04.068
COMMUNITIES IN COMMUNIIES OF

COLOR AND IT'S NOT MAKING OUR

02:29:05.569 --> 02:29:06.837
STREETS SAFER AND IT'S NOT

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:08.773
ACTUALLY IT SEEMS GOOD FISCAL

02:29:08.839 --> 02:29:09.974
