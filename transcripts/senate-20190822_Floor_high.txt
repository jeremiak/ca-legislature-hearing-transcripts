THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS AS VICE CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IS MY PRIVILEGE TO HONOR THE FACT FAMILY AS WE RECOGNIZE THE EIGHTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF FRANK FATS RESTAURANT. I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH FRANK FATS WONDERFUL RESTAURANT IT'S KNOWN FOR THE FAMOUS BANANA CREAM PIES AFTER WHICH WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO WALK BACK TO THE CAPITAL. AND CERTAINLY HOLDS MANY REYES OF OUR CAPITAL COMMUNITY MAY POLITICAL LUMINARIES INCLUDING EVERY CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR SINCE WORLD WAR HAS DYING THERE THAT'S IT OPENED IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE. AND FRANK FATS WAS PART OF AN ERA WHEN DEAL MAKING TOOK OFF AND TOOK PLACE OVER MEALS BETWEEN LEGISLATORS AND LOBBYISTS. PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS STEEL AFTER THAT A DEAL THAT I PERSONALLY AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF WAS BROKERED A FRANK FATS WITH THE LEGENDARY NAPKIN DEAL THAT RESULTED IN MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM. BEHIND THE SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT THOUGH IS THE STORY OF AN UNDOCUMENTED CHINESE IMMIGRANT ENCHANTED BY AMERICA'S GOLD MOUNTAIN FRANK FAT. DESPITE THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT FRANK IMMIGRATED TO THE U. S. AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. HE WAS DETAINED AT ANGEL ISLAND IMMIGRATION STATION AND AFTER HIS RELEASE HE WORKED AS A FRUIT PACKER A DISHWASHER. AND WAITER INTEL HE RECEIVED A LUCKY BREAK FROM A RESTAURANT PATRONS. BECAUSE FRANK HAD HELD ON TO THE CASH EARNINGS OF A CUSTOMER WHO HAD PURCHASED A KINO TICKET. AND LEFT BEFORE THE GAME BEGAN. AND APPRECIATION OF FRANK'S HONESTY THE CUSTOMER HELP THEM SECURE A LOAN FOR IN THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AT EIGHT OF SIX L. STREET. FRANK FATS RESTAURANT SUCCESS WAS BORN OUT OF HARD WORK KINDNESS AND THE DREAMS OF IMMIGRANT. FRANK IN THIS RESTAURANT A SYMBOL OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND I DARE SAY THE CALIFORNIA DREAM AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS IMMIGRANTS MAKE TO OUR SOCIETY OUR COMMUNITY. BREAK THAT'S A STILL A FAMILY BUSINESS TODAY WITH THREE OTHER RESTAURANTS AND CATERING BUSINESS RECENTLY EARNING THE TWENTY NINETEEN MICHELIN BIB GOURMAND AND A JAMES BEARD AMERICA'S CLASSICS AWARD. SO JOINING US TODAY ARE THREE GENERATIONS OF THE FAT FAMILY AND I'M GONNA SO WE HAVE IN IN BOTH THE RESTAURANT AND I HAVE TO SAY IT'S ALWAYS THE DENTIST ALSO IN THE DENTAL COMMUNITY THEY LEAD AS WELL.

HOW MANY OF US HAD BANANA CREAM PIE FOR BREAKFAST. YES I DID HI IT WAS THERE ARE WE LOVE FRANK FADS AND WE'RE PROUD TO COMMEMORATE THE EIGHTIETH ANNIVERSARY BUT FOR ME I WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH IF I MAY OUT OF RESPECT TO THE FAMILY I. N. A. ONCE ABILITY TO DIVEST FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY SAN DIEGO THE FAT FAMILY LEGACY ALSO HAS A CONNECTION TO OUR COMMUNITY AND THANKS TO THE TIRELESS WORK OF TOM FAT ONE OF FRANKS SONS. WITH THE ORIGINAL FRANK FATS THRIVING ON ELSTREE TOM VENTURED TO SAN DIEGO IN THE SEVENTIES TO EXPAND THE FAMILY'S BUSINESS HE CAME TO THE RESCUE OF AN ICONIC BRIGHT PINK ART DECO BUILDING ON THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY THAT IT ONCE BEEN HOME TO THE NINETEEN FORTIES NIGHT CLUB POSTING LEGENDS LIKE KING COLE AND SHELLEY WINTERS TOM TURNED IT INTO TWO RESTAURANTS FAT CITY AND CHINA CAMP A TWO FOLD TREASURE THAT RE ENERGIZED THE DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO RESTAURANT SCENE. I FIND MEMORIES OF GOING TO FAT CITY IN CHINA CAMP WHICH BOASTED FANTASTIC ASIAN CUISINE IN ADDITION TO BEAUTIFUL GARDENS AND A COLLECTION OF HISTORIC MACHINERY FROM THE OLD MINING DAYS. LUNCH WAS WHEN ELECTED OFFICIALS GATHERED TO HOLD COURT SOME EVEN IF IT BECAME A THING TO LEAVE A SPECIAL TRINKET BEHIND ADDED TO THE COUNTLESS STATUTES AND KNICKKNACKS THAT DECORATED. THE RESTAURANT SHELVES. BUT TOM'S LEGACY WASN'T ONLY CONTAINED IN HIS SAN DIEGO RESTAURANTS ARE THE MANY MORE THAT HE WOULD HELP OPEN AS HIS FAMILY BUSINESS BUSINESSES FLOURISHED OVER THE DECADES. TOM WAS A RIVER CITY CIVIC LEADER. HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. AND WE ALL UNDERSTAND THIS THAT IF YOU WANTED TO GET ENGAGED CIVIC LEE ARE YOU WANTED TO RUN FOR OFFICE YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO SIT DOWN WITH TOM. BECAUSE HE WOULD GIVE YOU GREAT ADVICE AND HE WAS ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. I THAT REALLY TOOK EVERYTHING TO HEART AND YOU WERE WISE IF YOU DIDN'T. MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT STATE POLITICS HE WAS A LUMINARY WITHIN SAN DIEGO'S ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY. WHEN TOM PASSED AWAY AFTER A BATTLE WITH CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HE WAS DESCRIBED AS THE HEART SOUL IN SOME WAYS THE CONSCIENCE OF SAN DIEGO'S API COMMUNITY INDEED HE WAS. BUT I WOULD SAY IT WENT BEYOND THE API COMMUNITY. JOHNNY CAM HAS SINCE CLOSED INVESTED WAS REPLACED BY ANOTHER RESTAURANT AND HOTEL SAN DIEGANS STILL TALK FINALLY ABOUT WHAT WAS ONCE THERE. TWO BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANTS A MAN WHO SHARED HIS FAMILY'S LEGACY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HIS BOUNDLESS ENERGY AND LOVE FOR SAN DIEGO WITH ALL OF US SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR FAMILY WITH THOSE OF US NOT JUST IN SACRAMENTO.

MANY THESE PLANS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED IN RECENT YEARS TO REFLECT CHANGING LOCAL PRIORITIES AS WELL AS THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL ON HOUSING GOALS BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY THE RESULTS IF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW DOCUMENT PREPARED FOR THE UPDATE IS CHALLENGED. IN COURT. DURING THE LITIGATION PROCESS IT'S AN UNCLEAR WHETHER THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITY PLAN OR AT THE UPDATE. IS IN EFFECT CAUSING GREAT UNCERTAINTY AND POTENTIALLY STALLING ALL DEVELOPMENT IS CERTAINLY INCREASING COSTS. UNDER THIS BILL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT WOULD APPROVED OR DEEMED COMPLIANT A COMPLETE PRIOR TO A COURT ISSUED WRIT TO RESCIND OR VûI THE UPDATEDCOMMITTEE PLAN CANNOT BE INVALID BY THE COURT THIS NEARLY TAYLOR IT MAINTAINS INTEGRITY OF THE SECRET PROCESS. AND DOES NOT PROHIBIT PLANS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FROM BEING CHALLENGED FINALLY THE BILL WOULD ONLY APPLY TO COMMUNITY PLANS AT A MET A HIGH SET OF CRITERIA INTO THE VANCE AND LOCAL AND STATE PRIORITIES INCLUDING. HOUSING AN ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS THE BILL IS SPONSORED BY LA MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI IT'S ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECT FESTIVAL. THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER HERTZBERG THANK YOU MADAM PRESENT JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO JOIN IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THE pEVERYTHING POSSIBLE ON IF NOT WE'LL MAKE SURE THEY DO MORE THINGS POSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS IN HOMELESS CRISIS THAT WE FACE THIS IS AN INTEGRAL PART.

AUGUST THE GIVEN TO IT BY ITS ASSEMBLY AUTHOR IT WOULD ADDRESS VOTER COERCIONAND PROTECT OUT INTEGRITY BY PROHIBITING ON EMPLOYER FROM REQUIRING OR REQUESTING. THAT AN EMPLOYEE BRING THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT TO WORK. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR STATE GOVERNMENT PROHIBIT ACTS OF VOTER INTIMIDATION AND COERCION BY THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS CODE DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM REQUESTING REQUIRING EMPLOYEES. TO BRING THEIR VOTE BY MAIL ABOUT INTO WORKER VOTE THEIR VOTE BY MAIL ABOUT IT AT WORK.

ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY EIGHT BY THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER TALLY AN ACT RELATING TO ENERGY. SENATOR DOLLY THAT FOR YEARS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS THIS IS A- NICE TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT MY OWN BILLS. AB ONE SEVENTY EIGHT TODAY IMPRISONING AB ONE TODAY THAT WILL CREATE A NEW NARAL EXEMPTION. MANDATORY SOLAR. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES DUE TO CATASTROPHIC EVENT WHEN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN DECLARED BY THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE SEVERAL CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH DESTROYED ONE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES OF LAND AND THOUSANDS OF HOMES. SO THESE HOMES. WERE UNDER INSURED AND WITH ALL. OF THE INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REBUILDING DUE TO THE NEW BUILDING STANDARDS IS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF THOSE FOLKS TO REBUILD. THE COST OF SOLAR SYSTEMS CAN ALONE ADD UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF COSTS REBUILD AB ONE SEVENTY EIGHT WILL GIVE A NARROW EXEMPTION. FROM THIS MANDATE TO THOSE WHO. MEET A CERTAIN CRITERIA SUCH AS INCOME INSURANCE COVERAGE LIMITATIONS. THIS WILL GIVE THE NECESSARY LEE FOR SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND WHO ARE STARTING TO PUT THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER. OF COURSE IF THEY WISH TO CHOOSE TO PUT SOLAR ON THEY MAY. LET'S HELP THE PEOPLE REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND LIVES. THIS BILL IS ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. SENATOR RESO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE REVIEWED THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE AND SIMPLY ONE OF THE QUESTIONSWE CAN ASK AND I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR REGARDING THE FISCAL IMPACTS OF THIS BILL AS AS AS WE ALL KNOW HE'S A BIG CHAMPION FOR BIO MASS WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE FISCAL IMPACT BY A MASS OF PEOPLE ADDING MORE SOLAR TO THEIR HOMES THROUGH THE CHAIR SENATOR DOLLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. YOU'LL ABSOLUTELY I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT BY MASS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IS IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY IMPACT BY OUT SOME AS YOU KNOW. WE'RE REQUIRED TO PUT SOLAR ON ROOFS AND- WE HAVE WE ARE WE'RE ACTUALLY PRODUCING MORE SOLAR THAN WE ACTUALLY NEED IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE DIVERTING THAT OTHER STATES SO. THE BIOMASS CONTRACTS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US NOW ARE REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE THE WHEN THE SUN IS NOT SHINING IN THE WIND'S NOT BLOWING THEY ACTUALLY PRODUCE GREEN POWER SO. IT'LL ACTUALLY I THINK HELP. ON THE ACE REALLY THIS BILLS ABOUT GETTING THOSE FOLKS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES WHO DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE ON THEIR SOLAR SO. I THINK IT WILL ACTUALLY HELP THE BAHAMAS INDUSTRY. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. SEND THEM WE ARE PRODUCING MORE SOLAR THAN WE NEED IN THE STATE'S AYE. I RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON THE BILL THANK YOU MA'AM. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR TO. WIENER WIENER BUT- I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I UDERSTAND THE INTENT BEHIND THE BILL AND I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE NEEDS OF THESE ARE HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY AND THE REASON HOWEVER THAT I'M OPPOSE THE BILL IS THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT A NARROW EXEMPTION THIS IS QUITE BROAD IT DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO A FEW SPECIFIC OF THE HORRIFIC FIRES THAT HAPPENED IT APPLIES IN ANY DISASTER NATURAL DISASTER. THAT'S BEEN DECLARED WITH NO START TIME. AND IN FIFTY SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DISASTERS HAVE BEEN DECLARED SO THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE CAMPFIRE OR SOME OF THE GROUP OF BUYERS IN THE NORTH BAY. OR MENTOR COUNTY THIS APPLIES MUCH MORE BOADLY THIS IS A LARGE EXEMPTION. FROM THE SOLAR ROOF TOP REQUIREMENT WHICH IS PART OF CALIFORNIA OFFERED TO A 100% PAUL. ENERGY OUR FAILED INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY MODEL AND SO THIS IS I THINK AN IMPORTANT WAY OF LOWERING COSTS NOT INCREASE COSTS. I AM FINALLY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE HAD THESE HORRIFIC FIRES IS CALIFORNIA'S ADDICTION TO INFINITE EXPANSION OF DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION WIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT INSTEAD OF MOVING TOWARDS A MORE DECENTRALIZED D. E. R. MODEL WE HAVE CONTINUALLY INCREASES INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH INCREASES THE RISK OF WILDFIRE. WE KNOW THE DVR'S INCREASE RESILIENCE NOT ONLY DOES IT. DECREASE THE NEED TO. EXPANDING THIS SYSTEM THAT RISKS WILDFIRES BUT IT ALSO ENSURES THAT WHEN A WHAT WHO WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN. AND WE KNOW THAT P. GINNY THEY MIGHT DO MASSIVE POWER SHUT DOWNS THROUGHOUT THEIR SERVICE TO OUR TERRITORY. THAT PEOPLE CAN STILL HAVE ENERGY BECAUSE OF THE SOLAR AND THE STORAGE SO I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION IF THIS WERE A VERY VERY NARROW TARGETED APPROACH WE COULD HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT IT IS ACTUALLY NOT NARROW IT'S QUITE BROAD I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I APPRECIATE THE. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ISSUE GIVEN THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED ALL OVER THIS STATE I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT MYSELF AFTER THE WILL THE FIRE AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE RECOVERY AND REBUILDING PROCESS OURSELVES RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE TRYING TO GET BACK INTO SMALL SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES SCHOOL TEACHERS NURSES FIREFIGHTERS WORKING CLASS PEOPLE TRYING TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK. I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE DENYING. THOSE HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO REBUILD. AN OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY. ON IN THE LONG TERM AND FRANKLY IN THE SHORT TERM THERE'S NOT A SOLAR ROOF MANDATE. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DOWNSIZE IN FACT THE SIZE OF THE GENERATION IF YOU'RE TAKING INTO EFFECT OTHER ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES THAT YOUR HOME. USING GREENER BUILDING MATERIALS AND YOU'RE USING STORAGE NOW THE CODE DOES SAY IF YOU DON'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE MEASURES YOU DO HAVE TO INSTALL PAN. AND THAT DOES HAVE UP FRONT COST I THINK THE ANALYSIS SITTING ON THE FLOOR TALKS ABOUT ABOUT. AT TEN THOUSAND OR MORE. THE CALCULATIONS FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION ARE TWENTY THOUSAND OR MORE IN SAVINGS IN FACT. AND SO THAT SAVINGS TO NINE HOMEOWNERS THE OPPORTUNITY THE CHOICE TO ACTUALLY SAVE THAT MONEY OVER TIME TO ME SEEMS ILL FOUNDED. END AND FURTHER MORE YOU KNOW I JUST I HAVE TO PUSH BACK ON THE PRINCIPLE OF OVER GENERATION THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH SOLAR IN THIS STATE. IN FACT. SO THERE IS THE CHEAPEST FORM OF ENERGY BEING PRODUCED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. ENDS OVER GENERATING SOLAR AS THE LA TIMES HAS REPORTED ON THE VERY FRONT PAGE OF THEIR PAPER. BASED ON TWO RECENT ANALYSES THAT OVER GENERATION. IS CHEAPER THAN RUNNING LARGE HEAVY ACRE PLANTS AT THAT SAME TIME CURTAILING THAT GENERATION DURING THOSE PEAK PERIODS IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER AGAIN THEN RUNNING BIG BASS LOAD GAS POWER AT PEAK. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO CHECK THESE PRINCIPLES WHEN YOU GO IT'S A TOUGH CONTEXT TO DO IT IN AND I DO NOT FAULT IN ANY WAY THE AUTHOR FOR FIGHTING FOR HIS PEOPLE AND I'M TRYING TO DO THE SAME SO. THAT'S WHY WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS COMMONSENSE MEASURE OF IT'S NOT ONLY THAT SOLAR IS BEING OVER PRODUCE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE PAIN STATES LIKE NEVADA THE ODD TO TAKE KERR OVERPRODUCED SOLAR THIS ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS LOST THEIR HOMES RECALLS A WHAT TO TRY TO YOU WAS TO REPEAL IT AT A MORE AFFORDABLE RATE WE DEAL WITH. HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE ON A DAILY BASIS AND IT'S PROVEN THAT ADDING SOLAR TO HOMES BECAUSE IMPACT THE COSTS OF HOMES I'VE TALKED TO DEVELOPERS LIKE DOCTOR REALTORS IT DOES INCREASE THE COST OF HOMES AND WE CAN'T BUILD HOMES AS IT IS AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD ANOTHER BURDEN TO SOMEONE WAS LOST THEIR HOMES. MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE I ASKED FOR A VOTE. CENTER GALGIANI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WHILE MY DISTRICT HAS NOT SUFFERED ANY FIRES MY DISTRICT WAS GROUND ZERO FOR THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY OF HOMES IT'S NOT JUST WHAT THE MONTHLY PAYMENT WILL BE FOR THE HOME IT'S WHETHER OR NOT THE BANK WILL UNDER RIGHT THE LOAN AND ON A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOME. IF SOMEBODY AT A FOUR HUNDRED AND- LET ME SEE IF OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SOLAR SYSTEM WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ON A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOME. AND IF THE BANK WON'T QUALIFY SOMEONE FOR A LOAN YOU SIMPLY CAN'T GET THE HOME. WHETHER YOU THINK YOU CAN AFFORD IT OR NOT THE BANK ASSEMBLY WILL NOT LOAN YOU THE MONEY AND A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH INCREASE IN A PAYMENT. THAT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR MANY MANY FAMILIES AND FURTHERMORE IF SOMEBODY HAS TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT THAT WOULD BE 20% THE EQUIVALENT OF A SOLAR SYSTEM. IF THAT SYSTEM WAS SAY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE IN CASH FOR THE LOAN. AND WHEN SOMEBODY'S REBUILDING THE NUMBERS RIGHT NOT WILL END MEMBERS WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. SENATOR DODD. MEMBERS ICE FOR US STATED STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW A HUNDRED FIFTY FOR MY NEIGHBORS LOST THEIR HOMES YOUR THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE DISTRICT OVER SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES IT OVER INSURED. THEY'RE UNDER INSURED THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES PROBABLY ANOTHER REBUILDING ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD. YANKEE CAN'T CAN'T AFFORD THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE PAYMENTS GOING DOWN THE LINE IN ANY OF THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS POLICY. YEAH WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'RE WE'RE SITTING POLICIES IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING THIS CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE'VE ALREADY ARE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE IN NAPA COUNTY IN CINEMA COUNTY WE'VE WE PASSED THE ORDINANCE TO. COMPEL EVERY RESIDENT IN THE COUNTY OF NAPA AND SADDAM AND AS OTHERS HAVE. TO BELONG TO A CCA. IT'S NOT OPT OUT YEAH IT IS OPT OUT SO EVERYBODY IS IN THE PROGRAM SO PRESUMABLY THERE GETTING CLEAN ENERGY ALREADY. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WERE FOR SEE THESE PEOPLE TO PUT IN SOLAR IN THEIR HOMES THIS IS A POLICY GONE AWRY I CAN UNDERSTAND THE POLICY ABOUT WANTING SO WE'RE- BUT IN THE AREAS WHERE WE'RE ALREADY DOING CCA'S. I THINK WE GET A RE THINK YOUR WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT MOREOVER MY BIG CONCERN IS US TELLING HOMEOWNERS IT'S HOMES HAVE JUST BURNED TO THE GROUND THEY'VE GOT NOTHING THEY'RE NOT COULD BE ABLE TO READ THEIR- BRIE BUILD THEIR HOMES. AND WERE TELLING HIM WHAT THE BEST INVESTMENT IS FOR THEM. WE'RE TELLING THEM OF THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW THE BETTER INVESTMENT IS FOR YOU TO SPEND ANOTHER FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON YOUR HOME TO PUT SOLAR AND MEMBERS THIS IS RIDICULOUS I ASK FOR IN. A YES VOTE. SENATOR SKINNER. HI THIS IS JUST STUPID THINGS YOU. SENATOR SKINNER. I HADN'T PLANNED ON JOINING THIS DEBATE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO WORK WERE SORT OF. CONFLATING THINGS OR OR PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER THAT AREN'T REALLY PUT TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE. A HOME SOLAR INSTALLATION IS NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT WE A QUAKED WITH. ACHIEVING OUR GREED WIDE RENEWABLE GOALS A HOME SOLAR INSTALLATION IS REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IT ALLOWS THAT HOME TO DEAL WITH ITS ELECTRICITY COSTS. AND JUST LIKE EFFICIENCY MEASURES IT GREATLY REDUCES THE NEED FOR DEPENDENCE ON GENERATION EXTERNALLY. SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO THINK ABOUT AND NOT TO INTEGRATE IT WITH THE FACT THAT GRID WIDE WE MAY BE. PRODUCING FOR MORE THAN ENOUGH SOLAR RESOURCE. WHICH WE I'LL ALL OF WE CAN DISCUSS ANOTHER TIME ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS WE COULD USE THAT STROLLER RESOURCE AND THAT OUR AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY PLANNING FOR BUT THE FIRST THING I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT TO CONFLATE IT WITH THE GRID WIDE RESOURCES NOT APPROPRIATE. SECONDARILY ON THE MORTGAGE ISSUE. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE EITHER RE FIGHTER HOMES OR GOTTEN ALONE RECENTLY FOR OUR HOMES WE KNOW THAT. B. ONE OF THE THINGS THE LANDER FACTORS IS WHAT ARE YOUR MONTHLY COSTS AND WHAT YOUR INCOMING CAN YOU COVER THOSE MONTHLY COSTS. IN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A SOLAR SYSTEM REDUCES YOUR MONTHLY COSTS SOME OF THE US IN THE WHEN THE FORMULATION. OF WHAT IT IS YOU CAN AFFORD FOR A LOAN. YOU CAN AFFORD A LARGER LOAN. AND THIS IS A STANDARD PRACTICE OF LENDERS IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ONLY PURCHASED A HOUSE WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM BUT I ALSO RE FIGHT IT. AND THE LENDER. WE WAS FIFTH AFTER THOSE QUESTIONS AND THEY WERE ASKED THEY WERE ASKED IN THE- QUESTIONNAIRE THAT I HAD TO PREPARE. FINALLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALIZE THAT SOLAR SYSTEMS OUR FORM OF HOME HARDENING. NO CERTAINLY SOLAR SYSTEM DOES NOT PREVENT THE HOUSE FROM BEING FROM GOING INTO FLAMES WHEN WE HAVE A CONFLAGRATION AS WE'VE HAD IN THE TUBS FIRE IN PARADISE BUT- WHEN WE DE COMMISSION OUR GRID TO PREVENT A FIRE. THAT SYSTEM WHICH NOW COMMONLY IS COMBINED WITH. STORAGE ALLOWS THAT FACILITY TO STILL HAVE ELECTRICITY. WHICH AS OUR POPULATION IS OLDER AND MORE OF US WILL BE POTENTIALLY RELYING ON THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO PLUG IN TO KEEP US ALIVE WE'RE GOING TO WANT THAT AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS MORE AND MORE OWNERS BUYING DIESEL GENERATORS. OUR MIND IS THAT DIESEL. POLLUTION IS ONE OF THE MOST HEALTH HARMING POLLUTION'S THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE WE DO NOT NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO BUY MORE DIESEL GENERATORS SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE MOTIVATION OF. TRYING TO ASSIST OUR. OWNERS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE FIX IT ALSO DOES NOT ADDRESS. THE PROBLEM OF WHAT OUR INSURANCE. INDUSTRY IS DOING TO OUR HOMEOWNERS WHICH IS A SEPARATE ISSUE WHICH I KNOW ALL OF US WANT TO ENGAGE IN AND TRY TO ADDRESS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE THREAT TO HOME OWNERSHIP IF YOU CANNOT GET INSURANCE FOR YOUR HOME. SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE. SENATOR GLACIER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS AYE AYE I JOIN IN APPRECIATING THE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION HERE TODAY ON THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW THAT FOR OR AGAINST THIS MEASURE THAT TO ALL OF US ARE BIG PROPONENTS OF SOLAR ENERGY AND CLEAN CLEAN ENERGY BUT I THINK THE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ENCOUNTER ON THIS FLOOR QUITE OFTEN IS THE VIEW THAT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR ALL OF US. FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE AND OUR STATE. AND YOU KNOW IT. HAVE A SOME OF US HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO UP TO PARADISE SEE THIS INCREDIBLE DESTRUCTION. THAT OCCURRED THERE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SEE QUITE CLEARLY. AS YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THAT THAT DEVASTATED TOWN IS THAT. SOME HOMES SURVIVE IN SOME HOMES DIDN'T BUT IT'S A HEAVILY FORESTED AREA. AND THAT THE VIEW IS IF WE WERE SELLING SOLAR HERE ON THE FLOOR OF HOUSE SOMETHING PAYS FOR ITSELF. WELL THERE'S GENERALIZATIONS WITHIN THAT CATEGORY IT'S SIMPLY A GENERALIZATION. AND IF YOU HAVE A HOUSE IN PARADISE THAT HAS BEEN BURNED DOWN BUT IT'S STILL SURROUNDED HEAVILY SURROUNDED BY FORESTED LAND. I DON'T THINK YEAH IF YOU'RE SELLING THAT PERSON SOLAR. THAT DOESN'T GET THE LIGHT OF DAY ON THEIR HOME VERY OFTEN THAT THAT GENERALIZATION REALLY APPLY. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US OFTEN HERE. IS IT A MANDATE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY HEALTHY GREAT COMPELLING NEED AND CERTAINLY ON THE ISSUE OF SOLAR THERE'S GREAT ARGUMENTS FOR IT. BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HEARD. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY DESERVE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS RIGHT FOR THEM WITH THE COST UP FRONT CAN BE BORNE OUT BY THE BENEFITS LONG TERM WHETHER IT'S IN A LOWER UTILITY BILL OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AND SHOULD WE AND THAT TIME OF NEED A BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT CHOICE AND THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. SENATOR JACKSON. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES SITE JOINT MY COLLEAGUES IN A ANGUISHING A LITTLE BIT OVER THIS DEBATE I'VE SOLAR MY HOME MY ENERGY BILLS COME TO ABOUT ELEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH TEN DOLLARS OF THAT IS THE TRANSMISSION CHARGE I HAVE TO PAY I APPRECIATE OF THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR I HAVE A SOLAR DRIVEN CAR SO I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF SOLAR AND I THINK THAT IT IS THE FUTURE. AND I SUPPORTED HEAVILY. BUT I REPRESENT A DISTRICT. THE LIKE OF MY GOOD FRIEND FROM NAPA AND IN OTHERS INDICATE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE HUMAN PART OF THIS. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE I KNOW. WHO CANNOT REBUILD THEIR HOMES. OR ARE STILL A YEAR AND A HALF LATER NOT TRUST A WILDFIRE BUT A SUBSEQUENT DEBRIS FLOW WHICH WAS INDEED A NATURAL DISASTER THE TOOK OUT 10% OF THE COMMUNITY OF MONT TO SEED. THE KILL TWENTY THREE P. I LOW END AND IT'S AN AREA I DRIVE THROUGH EVERY TIME I COME HOME FROM SACRAMENTO I AM REMINDED OF IT CONSTANTLY AND I PERSONALLY DID NOT SUFFER BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU. THE EMOTIONAL. TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EXPERIENCE LET ALONE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU CAN REBUILD YOUR HOME. AND IF THE INSURANCE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET IS EVEN ADEQUATE TO DO THE ACT. BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE UNDER INSURED. THE DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING ABOUT OTHER ASPECTS OF THE WILDFIRES IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT IN THE STATE ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY RELEVANT AND THOSE ARE DISCUSSIONS WHETHER IT'S ABOUT INSURANCE WHETHER IT'S ABOUT HOME HARDENING WHETHER IT'S ABOUT HOW WE DEVELOP OUR COMMUNITIES. PROACTIVELY IT RETRO EXPECTEDLY THOSE ARE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS. BUT AS I'VE LISTENED TO THIS DISCUSSION I AM HEARING MY CONSTITUENTS MY FRIENDS WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY AGONIZING OVER WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GOING TO EVEN BE ABLE TO REBUILD SOME SEMBLANCE OF THE HOMES THAT THEY HAD. AND I AGREE THAT I DON'T THINK WE CAN DECIDE HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHAT THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A HUGE NUMBER OF HOMES EXCEPT IN PARADISE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MANY HOMES. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO UNDERMINE OUR SOLAR PROGRAM. IF WE IF WE OF PASSES LEGISLATION BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE HUMANITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM THIS. AND THE NOTION OF AN ADDITIONAL WHETHER IT'S TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT IN A FEW YEARS IT WILL SAVE THE MONEY. THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT NOW I THINK WE HAVE TO HELP THESE PEOPLE IN EVERY WAY WE CAN. TO TRY TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES AFTER THIS MOST TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT THEY HAVE SUFFERED AND SO IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND CONTINUE TO WORK MY WITH MY FRIENDS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. TO TRY TO DO MORE TO CREATE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY BUT THIS IS NOT THE BILL TO DO IT. AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR RICE OF. MADAM PRESIDENT OF FIRST OF ALL I WANNA CLARIFY THAT MY INITIAL COMMENTS WERE SIMPLY TO ROAST SENATOR DOLLY BECAUSE THIS IS HIS FIRST BILL AS A CENTER AND I CAN SEE HOW THAT WENT REALLY AWRY. AND I'D LIKE ALL THE GIANTS FOR THAT. BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT ON THE RECORD MY COMMENTS RELATED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT AND WHY WE NEED TO PASS IT TODAY. THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO SLOW DOWN CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING IN. ITS GOT GAS REDUCTION GOALS AND GREEN IN THE GRID THIS IS NOT THE BILL THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT. SIMPLY SPEAKING IN RIGHT NOW THE URGENCY IS REPLACING THIS HOUSING GETTING PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR HOMES. AS THEIR HOMES WERE WHEN THEY LOST THEM AND IF THEY ELECT TO ADD SOLAR THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS LET THAT BE THEIR CHOICE BUT NOT LET USNOT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT AND GETTING THEM BACK INTO THEIR HOMES. MANY OF THESE FAMILIES WILL PROBABLY NOT REBUILD THEIR HOMES MANY OF THEM WILL HAVE A HARD TIME. GETTING THE FULL VALUE FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OF THEIR HOME SO THEY CAN FULLY REPLACE THEM WITHOUT HAVING OUT OF POCKET COSTS IF A HOME DOESN'T HAVE SOLAR NOW YOU'RE HAVE AT IT BELIEVE ME THERE'S GOING TO BE A COST. AND THERE IS GONNA BE. PERMIT PROCESS TO DO THAT AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR THAT WE PUT THIS REQUIREMENT ON VICTIMS OF FIRES THIS IS A COMPASSIONATE BILL. YOUR POSITION TODAY IS WHETHER YOU HAVE COMPASSION FOR THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE SUFFERING OR NOT. THAT THAT I REALLY WHAT THIS MATTERS ABOUT MY HOPE AS A LEGISLATURE WE STAND BY THE VICTIMS AND WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO GET HIM BACK IN THEIR HOMES AND I ASKED FOR NAY VOTE FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. SENATOR RUBIO. I'M I GUESS MY COMMENTS ARE MORE. CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH OUR GREAT SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA AND SAN DIEGO I WAS IN THE COMMITTEE WHO SUPPORTED THIS MEASURE AND I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS WHO'VE ALREADY OVERSTRESSED WORRIED CONCERNED THERE'S SO MUCH THAT GOES INTO FIGURING OUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A TRAGEDY AND I DO. YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE NOTIFIED THE COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION EVERYTHING IS VALID IN TERMS OF LONG TERM BENEFITS ARE RESILIENCY BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WHEN I LOOK AT THE AT THE MEASURE AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A SUNSET DATE TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT WILL ALLOW THESE FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO REBUILD. AT LEAST THOSE FIFTY YEARS TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET SO I WOULD ASK THAT WE THINK OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO REBUILD. AND I ALSO ASK FOR YOUR APPLE THANK YOU. SENATE ON. THANK YOU AND PRESIDENT IN AND COLLEAGUES IN FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY HOW MUCH I RESPECT EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU AND YOUR YOUR CONCERNS OVER THE BILL AND CERTAINLY OVER THOSE PEOPLE THAT OF. PRETTY MUCH LOST EVERYTHING. I'M I'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED MYSELF KIND OF A GREEN REPUBLICAN COMING FROM PROBABLY. THE MOST GREEN COUNTY IN THE STATE IN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WE HAVE. GEOTHERMAL ENERGY WE HAVE STORAGE WE HAVE SOLAR. WE DON'T HAVE HYDRO WE DON'T HAVE AND NEAR ANY BIG LAKES. I HELD MY HOME AND I'VE ONLY THREE ELECTRIC CARS I'VE DONE MY PART. TO GET THE STATE ON TRACK TO GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE REACH OUR GOALS AND I'M VERY PROUD ACTUALLY OF THE STATE BECAUSE WE PROBABLY COME FURTHER TO UTILIZING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY GOOD CLEAN ENERGY THE PROBABLY ANY OTHER STATE OR MAYBE ANY OTHER COUNTRY. ON THE PLANET. BUT YOU KNOW OUR HOMES ARE OUR HEAVEN ON EARTH AND A LOT OF FOLKS LOST EVERYTHING NOT ONLY DID THEY LOSE THEIR HOMES. FOR MANY THEY LOST THEIR JOBS THEY LOST THEIR KIDS LOST THEIR SCHOOLS THEY HAD TO GO AND OTHER SCHOOLS AND HAVE THE TRAUMA OF YOU KNOW MAKING NEW FRIENDS ALL OVER AGAIN. AND CERTAINLY BUT THE SHORTAGE OF HOUSING THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SEE IN THE COST OF MATERIALS RISE. WE PROBABLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CONTRACTORS TO QUICKLY BUILD ALL THE HOMES THAT WERE LOST. SO MANY OF A SHORTAGE OF THINGS OF COURSE COSTS INCREASE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR SOME OF YOU MAY BE YOUR HOBBIES OR GOLF OR TENNIS MY HOBBY ACTUALLY IS REAL ESTATE I BUY A LOT OF REAL ESTATE. I SAW A LOT OF REAL ESTATE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. PUTTING PANELS ON A HOME. IS A UP FRONT COST. PROSPECTIVELY IF YOU PUT PANELS ON YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY AND MAYBE EVEN REDUCING THE COST OF THOSE SOLAR PANELS OVER TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS. BUT TODAY WHEN. MOST OF THESE VICTIMS ARE UNDER INSURED THEY HAVE TO FIND ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO. GET THEIR HOMES REBUILT AGAIN. AND THE BANKS ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE UTILITY PRICES ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS IN THE FUTURE. THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT YOUR INCOME. AND YOUR INCOME MATCH WHAT YOUR EXPENSES ARE GOING TO BE WITH RESPECT YOUR MORTGAGE ON YOUR NEW. HOME THAT IS GOING TO BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR. SO I ALSO DON'T GET A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA WITH 1100% OF WHAT YOU SAID ON THIS BILL. AND SO I HAD TO TAKE OPPORTUNITY STAND UP BECAUSE I THINK SHE SPOKE WITH A LOT OF WISDOM I THINK SHE SPOKE WITH A LOT OF COMPASSION AND I'M PROUD TO JOIN HER. IN URGING ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS COMPASSIONATE BILL. TO HELP THESE PEOPLE OUT. OUR DR ALREADY BE ONE SEVENTY THANK YOU. SEC CENTER STERN. YEAH I KNOW I AYE AYE RARELY SPEAKING I'M SPEAKING TWICE I JUST WANNA GET SOME FACTS IN THE RECORD JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR. EXEMPTIONS EXIST UNDER CURRENT LAW. IF YOU'RE IN A HEAVILY SHADED AREA WITH TREES SO MOST OF PARADISE WILL BE EXEMPT UNDER CURRENT LAW. IF THEIR SHADE YOUR EXAMS. IF THEE AND THIS IS ON YOUR ANNOUNCES HOMES THAT ARE SHADED BY TREES HILLS OR OTHER STRUCTURES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO INSTALL SOLAR HOMEOWNERS IN AREAS WITH COMMUNITY SOLAR PROGRAMS LIKE A CC A WHERE THEY HAVE COMMUNITY SOLAR ARE ALSO EXEMPT SO JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT HOW THE CURRENT LAW WORKS. I JUST DON'T WANT TO. OVER INFLATE WHAT BUILDING CODES GONNA DO THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE RIGHT NOW RESPECT THE AUTHOR AND ALL THE ENTHUSIASM HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIMS OF THE WALLS THE FIRE AND PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY I WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO ENJOY THESE BENEFITS TOO SO I'LL BE VOTING NO. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION EIGHT. CENTER DAHLE YOU MAKE INCLUDE. WELL THANK YOU FOR HEALTHY DEBATE I WANT TO START OFF WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE LIGHT BEFORE I GET SERIOUS SOME I HOPE NOBODY HAD A BAD PEACH YESTERDAY AND I ALSO MAYBE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO JOCKEY MY BILLS WHEN THEY GET OVER HERE FROM THE ASSEMBLY. SO BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO. IN OUR MY DISTRICT I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER HERE WATCH THIS BILL CLOSELY BECAUSE IT. EFFECTS PEOPLE WHO WE'VE LOOKED IN THE AYE WHO ARE TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES. THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T. THIS ISN'T A DEBATE ABOUT SOLAR WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE IT OR NOT HAVE IT ON A HOMES IS DEBATE ABOUT. GETTING PEOPLE WHO'VE LOST EVERYTHING. BACK IN A HOME AND IS REBUILDING THEIR LIVES. I NARROW THIS BILL DOWN IT SUNSETS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THEY ONLY HAVE IF THEY CAN EVEN GET A BUILDING PERMIT BY THEN TO REBUILD THEIR OWN. GOD HELP ON. AND IF YOU BUILD A HOME IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST TEN YEARS OUR BUILDING STANDARDS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH AT THE LOCAL LEVELS AND IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. AND MOST THESE OR UNDER INSURED. THIS IS NOT A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE SOUL OR NOT OR WHETHER BIOMASS VERSES WHATEVER I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE DEBATES AND MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I'VE CHAMPION A LOTOF LEGISLATION ON BIOMASS AND FORESTRY AND CARBON OUTPUT FROM FIRES. THAT IS THIS IS NOT ABOUT THAT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT UTILITIES THIS IS NOT ABOUT INSURANCE THIS IS ABOUT ALLOWING SOMEBODY TO. EITHER. NOT PUT SOLAR ON THEIR HOME IF THEY WANT TO THEY CAN. AND YES THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS IN THE SOLAR FEW HAVE SHADE IN THOSE THINGS YES THOSE ARE THERE BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO. ARE TRYING TO GET BACK IN THEIR HOMES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEBATE. ON THOSE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY THIS BILL SUNSETS. THANK YOU MEMBERS.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS SPEAKING AND WITHOUT REFERENCE THE FILE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW OR MAY HAVE HEARD YESTERDAY I WAS PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED AS I WAS WALKING FROM THE CAPITAL TO AN EVENT AND I ALSO WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THE PRESS TERM AND THE MINORITY LEADER AND MANY OF YOU HERE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED YOUR BOTH PERSONAL AND PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ME AND THE COMBINATION OF THE ASSAULT ON YESTERDAY. CERTAINLY IT'S ONLY THROUGH CIVIL DEBATE. GOOD POLICY FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER I NEED TO MAKE A NOTE THAT YESTERDAY'S ASSAULT IS NOT SIMPLY THE ACT OF A LONE EXTREMIST. THIS IS THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF THREATENING AND VIOLENT RHETORIC BY THE ANTI VACCINE MOVEMENT. MY ASSAILANT THIS PROUD OF HIS VIOLENT ATTACKED IN FACT HE POSTED ON FACEBOOK FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT TO THE ISOLATION OF MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS. AND AS IN THE VICTIM OF THAT I DID ASK FACEBOOK YESTERDAY TO TAKE IT DOWN. BUT THEY HAVE REFUSED NOT VIOLENT ENOUGH. FACEBOOK IS DELIBERATELY GIVING A PLATFORM TO HIS VIOLENCE AND PERHAPS INCITING OF ANOTHER PERSON TUESDAY TO DO THE SAME EIGHTY ONE UP THE ANTE. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHY WHY MY SENATE SO JUSTIFIED TO PHYSICALLY ATTACKED ME YESTERDAY. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE OPPONENTS OF MY BILL SB TWO SEVENTY SIX HAVE REPEATEDLY USED. AND CONDONE VIOLENT RHETORIC AND IMAGERY JUST THE FINE BY. SO VICTIM BUT. MANY IF YOU AND YOUR OFFICES YOUR STAFF HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME OF THIS ALREADY BOTH OF THOSE OF YOU ARE HERE FOR SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND ALSO ONE SB TWO SEVENTY SIX CAME THROUGH THIS CHAMBER IN FACT IN TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE'VE HAD SOME MEMBERS WHO ACTUALLY EVEN HAVE TO CLOSE OUR DISTRICT OFFICES BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THE THREATS. TO THE STAFF. MORE RECENTLY. OUR STATE JUNIOR WHO OPPOSES THE BILL CAME TO THE CAPITOL. CALLED VACCINES HOLOCAUST PREVIOUSLY COMPARED MY BILL. TO THE JEWS BEING PUT TOGETHER US DURING WORLD WAR TWO. WELL IN THE MEANTIME THE END OF ACCESS POSTS MEMES OF ME IS LAWYER AND DOCTOR MANGEL A AND YOU WONDER WHY. YOU WONDER WHY SOMEONE WOULD BE INCITED TO COMMIT VIOLENCE. THE RALLY IN FRONT OF OUR BUILDING HERE AND WHAT DID THEY HAVE BEFORE THEM IN THE RALLY A PICTURE. A POSTER WITH A DRY MY FACE SPLATTERED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE BLOOD. AND THEN THEY WALKED INTO THE HEARING ROOM IN THE ASSEMBLY CHAMBERS ASSEMBLY HEARING HEALTH HEARING ROOM WEARING T. SHIRTS WITH THIS IMAGE. AND YOU WONDER WHY SOMEONE DECIDES TO ACTUALLY CARRY OUT MISSILES. THEY MAILED BRICKS THROUGH THE FAMILY MEMBERS. AND IN FACT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A RALLY IN AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO BUT I'VE HEARD THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMING IN WEARING GUY. FAWKES MASK. NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW HISTORY GUY FAWKES WAS A MAN WHO. THREATEN THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON A LEGISLATIVE BODY THE PARLIAMENT. SO THINK ABOUT IT THEY WANT TO COME. TO OUR STATE CAPITOL THE STATE CAPITOL CALIFORNIA WHERE WE MEET YOU'RE NOT CHAMBERS. DRESSED UP AS SOMEONE WHO WISHES TO COMMIT A TERRORIST ATTACK ON A LEGISLATURE ALLEGEDLY BODY. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M HERE TO SAY. BECAUSE IT'S NOT NEARLY THE ONE ACTOR THE ONE PERSON WHO ASSAILED YESTERDAY THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. IT'S THIS BROADER. ACCEPTANCE OR TOLERANCE OF THIS KIND OF VIOLENT RHETORIC ONE THAT'S GIVEN A PLATFORM BY SOCIAL MEDIA OTHERS. THIS NEEDS TO STOP. IT'S NO SURPRISE. THAT THERE WAS A PHYSICAL ASSAULT AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE NEXT ONE WILL BE BUT THIS DOES NEED TO STOP AND I DO WANT TO THANK. ALL OF YOU AND MADE YOU SPOKEN OUT AND SAID WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT CIVILLY WE HAVE DIFFERENCES. AND WE NEED TO DEBATE THOSE DIFFERENCES. AND DEAL WE MADE WE'RE NOT ALL GOING TO AGREE. BUT WE CAN DO IT CIVILLY. WE CAN DO IT PASSIONATELY BUT WE DON'T NEED TO THREATEN FULLY. AND COULD AND. BASICALLY COMMITTEE YEAH SUGGEST VIOLENCE AND HAVE SOMEONE HOPE SOMEONE CARRIES IT OUT AND SO WITH THAT I DO WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I THINK AS WE MOVED TOGETHER WE ARE GOING TO WORK-TOGETHER FOR BETTER CALIFORNIA BUT WE ALSO I HOPE WE CAN CALL ON PEOPLE. JOINTLY TOGETHER. TO SAY NO MORE THIS KIND OF RHETORIC NEEDS TO STOP. YOU MAKE YOUR ARGUMENTS BUT DON'T THREATEN EE NO BY THANK YOU STILL UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE OF THE FLOOR CENTER NIELSEN.
