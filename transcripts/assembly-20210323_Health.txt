AND NUMBER SEVENTEEN AB EIGHT THIRTY ONE WITH IS A HEALTH COMMITTEE BILL SO WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE TO- THE FIRST BILL- ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWELVE TWELVE BY MISTER CHOW MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB TWELVE FIFTY TWO WOULD BRING HEALTH INFORMATION COLLECTED BY FDA APPROVED APPLICATIONS USED AT THE DIRECTION OF A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TO BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL PRIVACY LAW OR C. M. I. A. THE FDA HAS RECENTLY STREAMLINED THE PROCESS BY WHICH DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE. APPROVED GIVING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEW WAYS TO GET USEFUL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL PILLS ALREADY IN USE. THESE SKILLS COMBINE INGESTIBLE MICROCHIPS SENSORS WITH PHARMACEUTICALS AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE PATCH THAT COLLECTS INFORMATION AND INSENSITIVE. TO A MOBILE APPLICATION. THIS PRODUCT CAN RECORD THE TIME AND THE QUANTITY OF THE DRUG IS CONSUMED THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE PERSON TAKING THE DRUGS SUCH AS THE TEMPERATURE ACTIVITY LEVEL AND HEART RATE. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION CAN BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND WOOD UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BE PROTECTED UNDER CLIA AND HIPAA. IN ORDER FOR THIS KIND OF DATA TO BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION IT NORMALLY NEEDS TO BE GENERATED BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. HOWEVER INFORMATION GENERATED OR COLLECTED BY A DIGITAL HEALTH APPLICATION MEETING AT THE PATIENT LEVEL AND OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL FACILITY WILL NOT BE CAPTURE UNDER THE EXISTING DEFINITION OF MEDICAL INFORMATION. AB TWELVE FIFTY TWO WILL BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT UNDER C. M. I. A. BY CONSIDERING ANY BUSINESS THAT OFFERS SUCH AN APPLICATION OR DEVICE. TO A CONSUMER TO BE A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA IS TREATED WITH THE SAME CARE AS DATA THAT IS GENERATED IN A TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SETTING. AND PROHIBIT THAT INFORMATION FROM BEING SHARED WITH OUTPATIENTS WRITTEN CONSENT- WITHOUT AYE HEALTH CLUB MARIE MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS- HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL MOVE TO OUR- PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORT. AND WE'VE TAKEN A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION ON A. B. TWELVE FIFTY TWO WHICH COULD PROVIDE CRUCIAL PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS BY EXTENDING EXISTING STRONG HEALTH PRIVACY PROTECTIONS TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION GENERATED BY NEW FORMS OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY. IN CALIFORNIA PATIENT PRIVACY IS PROTECTED BY THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT AND HIPAA HOWEVER THESE TWO LAWS ONLY PROTECT SENSITIVE HEALTH INFORMATION IS GENERATED BY CERTAIN ENTITIES. THE INFORMATION CREATED BY NEW HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS DIGITAL HELP FEEDBACK SYSTEMS AND ONLINE HEALTH SERVICES DO NOT FALL INTO THIS RUBRIC. AND ALTHOUGH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT WOULD APPLY TO THE STATE OUT THAT WAS NOT STRONG. FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY PA ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO STOP THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. BUT SEE MY A AND HAVE PROPER MOST CASES THIS AT ALL. AND CONSUMER BY. THAT C. T. PAY OFF PROCESS. CAN SOMETIMES BE SO- ONEROUS THEY'VE HAD THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING CONSUMERS FROM STOPPING THE SALE OF THEIR INFORMATION. HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE BILL RESTRICTING THIS BILL TO ONLY THE HEALTH TECHNOLOGY THAT FDA APPROVED COULD CREATE. A DISINCENTIVE FOR DEVELOPERS TO GO THROUGH THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS BUT THE RECOMMEND REMOVING LANGUAGE. LIMITING THE BILL TO COVERING ONLY HEALTH TECHNOLOGY THE FUSE AT THE DIRECTION OF A PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE. WITH THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF COLLECTING THE INDIVIDUAL'S INFORMATION IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THOSE PROVISIONS COULD WORK IN PRACTICE AND COULD CREATE LOOPHOLES- WITH ADJUSTMENTS THIS PROVISION HOWEVER AB TWELVE FIFTY TWO WOULD PROVIDE ESSENTIAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. OF WORKING TO SIMMER SENT TO THE DATA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU BEFORE WE MOVE ON I'M GOING TO ASK OUR WE HAVE LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A QUORUM SOMEONE ASK OUR SIX US.

OUR NEXT BILL- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVIES AB THREE EIGHTY ONE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB THREE EIGHT ONE I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. WHETHER STATUS HAD TO DEAL WITH THE GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS I'M LIKE WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. IT CANNOT BE LOST BUT WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS HEALTH EPIDEMIC SWEEPING OUR STATE. AS WELL AS OUR COUNTRY OF COURSE I'M TALKING ABOUT A BATTLE WITH OPIOIDS. ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL THERE ARE OVER ONE THOUSAND DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS NATIONALLY BETWEEN. MAY TWENTY NINETEEN AND MAY TWENTY ONE MAKE OF THAT AB ONE THOUSAND. IN THE LAST YEAR THIS IS RISE BY 34% THOSE ARE BETTING THEIR DICTION TO THESE DRUGS ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE VICTIMS. IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE HEARD OF DRUG DEALERS SELLING NARCOTICS NEAR GROUNDS A DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES OR WORSE MILLION NARCOTICS TO THEM. TO HELP COMBAT THIS EPIDEMIC ON MARCH FIFTH TWENTY NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ISSUED INFORMATIONNOTICE NINETEEN DASH ZERO ZERO NINE. THE FIRM ON NOTICE TECHNOLOG THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IN AUTHORIZED DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES TO PROCESS AND USED TO LACKS ON BETTER KNOWN AS NOR CAN HOWEVER THIS NOTICE DID NOT REQUIRE DRUG TREATMENT FACILITIES TO PURCHASE. DARKHAN AND HAVE A STAFF MEMBER TRAINED IN ADMINISTRATION ONSITE AT ALL TIMES. AB THREE EIGHTY ONE IS A SIMPLE MEASURE MEANT TO EXPAND THAT FORMAL NOTICE BY REQUIRING DRUG TREATMENT CENTERS TO ACTUALLY CARRY AT LEAST TWO DOSES OF DARKHAN. ON SITE PLUS HAVE A STAFF MEMBER TRAINED HOW TO ADMINISTER IT. THERE'S AN ESTIMATED OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED JUST BY HAVING THESE KIDS WITHIN FAMILY HOMES. THE CLOSING I BELIEVE THIS IS A COMMON SENSEAPPROACH TO LITERALLY HELP SAVE THE LIVES OF A LIBERAL CLASS OF PEOPLE. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WITH ME HERE TODAY VIA PHONE IS JOHN TO PROCEED WITH THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SHANTI FRESH AND I'M A PROSECUTOR THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHERE I SERVE AS THE ASSISTANT CHIEF OF OUR MAJOR NARCOTICS DIVISION. I'M HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE EIGHTY ONE ONE OF OUR AREAS OF FOCUS IS THE PROTECTION OF CHEMICALLY DEPENDENT NARCOTICS USERS WHO ARE INJURED BECAUSE THE INFLUX OF DANGEROUS OPIOIDS INCLUDING FENTANYL WHICH IS FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT THAN MORPHINE. DEATHS ARE SKYROCKETING IN OUR NATION ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CURRENT PANDEMIC ONE OF THE TROUBLING TRENDS WE'VE SEEN STATEWIDE INVOLVED THE RISE OF OVERDOSES AND DRUG TREATMENT CENTERS. SINCE RECEIVING TREATMENT AT THE CENTERS FIND WAYS TO ACCESS HOPE YOU IS. THE RISK OF OVERDOSE IS ESPECIALLY HIGH WITHIN THESE FACILITIES SINCE PATIENT DRUG TOLERANCE DECREASES AFTER PERIODS OF SOBRIETY. THIS DEADLY RISK IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT CENTRAL QUIETLY CONTAMINATE THE ILLICIT DRUG SUPPLY. MOST COMMONLY USERS ARE KILLED BY COUNTERFEIT OXY CODE ON PILLS THAT FORENSICALLY TESTED AS PURE FENTANYL. NALOXONE ALSO KNOWN AS NOR CAN. IT EFFECTIVE DRUG THAT REVERSES THE EFFECTS OF AN OPIOID OVERDOSE. QUITE SIMPLY IT SAVES LIVES WITH A SIMPLE SQUARE IN THE NOSE. THE VERY FIRST OPIOID OVERDOSE MITIGATION MEASURES SUGGESTED BY OUR CDC. THE TO QUOTE EXPAND DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF NALOXONE AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION EDUCATION AND QUOTE. WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. BECAUSE RECENTLY A POLICE OFFICER IN OUR COUNTY WAS SAVED BY NALOXONE AFTER AN ACCIDENTAL FENTANYL EXPOSURE THAT OCCURRED. DURING THE HANDLING OF DRUG EVIDENCE. EIGHT SUCH AS KINETIC MESSAGE WISCONSIN AND NEW MEXICO. HAVE REQUIRED TO WALK DON'T ACCESS TO POTABLE PATIENTS. WE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME BY REQUIRING THE DRUG TREATMENT CENTERS THE DEATH TO UNEXPIRED DOSES OF NALOXONE SO THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY TREAT THEIR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS ON THE VERGE OF DEATH. AB THREE EIGHTY ONE WILL SAVE LIVES. BECAUSE OF THAT I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN AS THEY'RE IN THERE HE SAID THERE'S NO OPPOSITION- SO THERE'S NO OPPOSITION WITNESS THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FORTY TWO- THIS LET ME POINT OUT A FEW THINGS OF REGARDING THIS PARTICULAR VEIL- THIS BILL WILL ELIMINATE THE COST FOR PATIENTS WHO NEED A COLONOSCOPY IS AFTER A POSITIVE TAKE HOME TEST AND- PROMOTE- EARLY DETECTION FOR COLON CANCER. BY LETTING PATIENTS- SCREEN THEMSELVES SAFELY AT HOME COLORECTAL CANCER IS THE SECOND HIGHEST CAUSE OF CANCER DEATH IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE THIRD MOST COMMON CANCER IN MEN AND WOMEN. HOWEVER THIS CANCER IS THE MOST PREVENTABLE WITH SCREENING AND EARLY DETECTION TIMELY SCREENING CAN REDUCE THE CANCER MORTALITY BY UP 2660% THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REQUIRES INSURANCE TO COVER PREVENTATIVE SCREENING TESTS WITHOUT COST SHARING HOWEVER. MANY HEALTH PLANS CHARGED FOR THE FOLLOW UP EXAMINATION BECAUSE ONLY THE FIRST TASK IS CONSIDERED PREVENTIVE PREVENTIVE- THE AVERAGE COST OF THE FOLLOW UP COLONOSCOPY IS ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS IS A VERY FOR SENIORS LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY NEED LEAVING THEM AT HIGH RISK OF A PREVENTABLE DEATH. MY BILL CHANGES CURRENT LAW BY PROHIBITING HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA FROM FOR RECORD CARVING COST SHARING ON SCREENINGS AND LAB TESTS FOR ANYONE AT HIGH RISK FOR COLO RECTAL CANCER. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS BOTTOM- NUMBER. THE ADDAMS HOLDEN WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY AND ALSO A DOCTOR STONE WALL ANDERSON FOR C. FOR.

YEAH THANK YOU YEAH- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT AB THREE FORTY TWO. I'M DOCTOR DANIEL STONE WALL ANDERSON PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COLORECTAL CANCER COALITION THE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. IN 202-115-0008 HUNDRED EIGHTY CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP COLON CANCER AND FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETY CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPECTED TO DIE FROM COLON CANCER. THIS IS A TRAGEDY SINCE COLON CANCER HAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE SCREENING TESTS OF ALL CANCER SCREENING TEST. ON SCREEN YOU HAVE A SIX POINT 7% CHANCE OF GETTING COLON CANCER. ONE IN EVERY FIFTEEN ON SCREEN PEOPLE GET COLON CANCER LIKE GROWTH THE SIZE OF YOUR COMMITTEE. YOU CAN EXPECT ONE PERSON DEVELOP COLON CANCER. ONE IN THIRTY FIVE ON SCREEN PEOPLE WOULD DIE OF COLON CANCER WITH SCREENING COLON CANCERS ARE PREVENTABLE BY REMOVING POLICY. CANCERS ARE FOUNDED EARLY TREATABLE STAGE AND WITH SURGERY. THE COLON CANCERS SECURE. AS A RIP IN THE U. S. FOR A SERVICE GOT SCREENING. IN A DROP IN THE DEATH RATE FROM. TWO POINT 8% TO ZERO POINT 5% THIS MEANS THAT IN THE SCREEN POPULATION INSTEAD OF ONE AND- THIRTY FIVE DYING OF COLON CANCER IT'S ONE AND TWO HUNDRED MORE SIMPLY WE HAVE TO SCREEN. FIFTY PEOPLE TO PREVENT ONE PERSON FROM DYING FROM COLON CANCER. IN SPITE OF THIS AN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE SCREENING. THROUGH EITHER- FECAL TEST DONE AT HOME OR COLONOSCOPY EVERY TEN YEARS ONLY 72% OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN SCREENED. WHY ARE SO MANY AND SCREENED. YOU HAVE TO OFFER BOTH THE HOME TESTING AND THE COLONOSCOPY. AND WE KNOW THAT IT TESTING PLACES INCREASE FINANCIAL BURDENS ON OUR PATIENTS. ABOUT KAISER PERMAN SAY THEY STARTED THEIR MAIL OUT SCREENING PROGRAM INCREASE COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING THEY MADE SURE THEY DID NOT CHARGE A COPAY FOR THE COLONOSCOPY AFTER A POSITIVE IT BY OFFERING BOTH COLONOSCOPY AND FIT TESTING. THEY EXCEEDED COLORECTAL CANCER INCIDENCE BY MORTALITY BY 52% THE BILL ENCOURAGING FIT TESTING COULD MICHAEL REICHEL CANCER SCREENING CALL STAVING. MODEL BASED STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING USING HOME FECAL TESTING CAN RESULT IN COST SAVING IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE OF THE RISING COST OF COLON CANCER CARE. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS DECREASED COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING RATES BY LIMITING ACCESS TO SCREENING COLONOSCOPIES HOWEVER CLINICS THEY WROTE RELY ON MAILED OUT DONE HOME FIFTY S. THING HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR SCREENING RATES. AS REPORTED BY PARK STREET COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER A CALIFORNIA FEDERAL QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER. BY VOTING FOR THIS BILL YOU AN COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING RATES AND SAVE LIVES. WITH INCREASED USE OF IT AS WE CAN PUT MONEY BACK INTO OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

ACADEMIC GLAD THANK YOU SEE DAVID AND MANY OTHER SMALLER INNOVATIVE INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES SUCH AS VERIFYING THAT SPECIALIZES IN TESTING RELATED TO THYROID CANCER LUNG CANCER AND BREAST CANCER. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO ONE THIRTY EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE PAYMENT RATE IN MEDIC CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. IN TO HELP MAINTAIN ACCESS TO ALL OF THE TESTING FOR MEDIC CAL PATIENT. EIGHTY TWO SIXTY FIVE IS NEEDED TO UPDATE MEDIC HELP PRICING REQUIREMENTS FOR LAB TESTS TO REFLECT THE NEW MEDICARE PAYMENT SYSTEM. LAVATORY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SUCH AS THE ONES I MENTIONED HAVE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK AND UNDER CONSIDERABLE STRAIN AS THEY TRIED TO SUPPORT OUR STATE FOR BONTA CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE PERCENT CUT ARM FORWARD I WANT THE MOST CHALLENGING TIME FOR CLINICAL LABORATORIES IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A WELL DEVELOPED PAYMENT SYSTEM IN PLACE TO SET OUR CALIFORNIA RIGHT. NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR NEW CUTS TRIGGERED BY AN OLD AUTOMATIC TIED TO A PRIOR VERSION OF THE MEDICARE PAYMENT SYSTEM. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWO SIXTY FIVE. THANK YOU I'M AVAILABLE QUESTIONS ALSO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I DON'T BELIEVE ARE THERE ANY REGISTERED WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE. NOT HEARING TOO MANY WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ACTUALLY I HAVE A I HAVE A QUESTION AND THAT'S WHAT I KNOW THAT. ERICA RATES ARE ARE LOW- AND NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THEM REDUCED IN ANYWAY SO I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE- IS THERE IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THT THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY HAS CREATED AN ACCESS PROBLEM SO I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS- ARE THE NUMBER OF LABS DECLARE- DECLINING MEDICARE BUSINESS. OR LIMITING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. WELL INSTRUMENT THE AT THE CUTS THAT HAVE BEEN TRIGGERED BY THE FEDERAL CHANGES ARE YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO. THE GOAL FOR THIS BILL IS TO TAKE ACTION BEFORE THOSE AT WE SEE THAT DECREASING ACCESS WHICH- WE DO EXPECT AND I THINK OUR WITNESSES MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS. WE DO EXPECT THAT IF THESE CHANGES ARE TRIGGERED IF WE SEE LABORATORY REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT ARE EFFECTIVELY. B. BELOW THE COST OF PROVIDING A SERVICE WE WILL SEE LABORATORIES ACTUALLY MOVE OUT OF CALIFORNIA WILL ALSO SEE A LABORATORY CAPACITY AND ACCESS REDUCED IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET GET OUT AHEAD OF THAT BY. IMPLEMENTING THIS NECKLACE RATIONALIZATION NOW I'M DO I EITHER OF OUR WITNESSES WHEN IT. BUILT ON THAT. RIGHT THE MONEY FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD I'LL JUST ADD YOU KNOW BERKELEY PARENTHOOD WILL NEVER CLOSE OUR DOORS TO MEDICAL PATIENTS AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW THAT IS WHO WE SERVE- BUT IT DOES TO BE REALLY IMPACT HOW WE DO BUSINESS HAVING. METRO ACTIVE CLAWBACKS AND RATE REDUCTIONS- WHICH WE'VE SEEN FAN. THAT POLICY WENT INTO PLACE- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS- IT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO MEET OUR YEARLY BUDGET- WORKING AT YEARS TO MONTHS TWO YEARS AFTER PAYMENTS ALREADY BEEN PAID. AND THEN BACK ARE THEN TAKEN BACK BY THE DEPARTMENT- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A DRIVER'S PAYER MIX TO LEAN ON HAVING MENTIONED 90% OF OUR PATIENTS ARE MEDICARE PATIENTS. IT JUST MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO MAINTAIN OUR. OUR HELP CENTER FINALLY. OKAY THANK YOU.

THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB NINE FORTY THAT COLLEGE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. WE ALL KNOW THAT- GOING TO COLLEGE IS STRESSFUL- BUT- MENTAL HEALTH IS A LITTLE DISCUSSED- CRISIS THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COLLEGES AND FRANKLY IT'S ONLY MADE WORSE DURING THIS DURING THIS LAST YEAR'S PANDEMIC. A SUICIDE IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS- ONE OF FOUR STUDENTS HAVE A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL ILLNESS SUCH AS DEPRESSION. WHICH CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH STUDENTS REACH OUT FOR HELP AND MANY TIMES. THEY HAVE WAIT TIMES THAT CAN BE DAYS TO WEEKS TO MONTHS AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BROKEN ANKLE YOU GO SEE HELP RIGHT AWAY. SO THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR A CALL STUDENTS. BY PRIORITIZING MONIES FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT ADMINISTRATIVE FUND- WITH ME ARE TO STUDENTS FROM- CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES FROM THE CSU SYSTEM. WE HAVE A G. ONE LOU WITH THE SSA AND MAGGIE WHITE. WHO'S THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE CSU SYSTEM AZCARRAGA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR OUR WITNESSES. QUAN LI AND MAGGIE WHY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CARE WOULD ANDMEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS QUAN LOW AFFECTING YOUR VEHICLE STATE SPENDING POLITICAL SCIENCE AND HISTORY AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY ACTION. REPRESENTING NEARLY HALF A MILLION IF YOU STUDENTS I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY NINE FORTY. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED FUNDING TO ALL TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES TO EXPAND OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SIMPLY PUT AB NINE FORTY WILL RE ALLOCATE MONEY FROM THE UNDER UTILIZED PROP SIXTY THREE ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNT SO OUR CAMPUSES CAN HIRE ADDITIONAL CONCERTS AND BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT STUDENTS PSYCHOLOGICALLY. THE NEED FOR ACTION IS CLEAR AS THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY THIS YEAR IF YOU HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN FULL TIME EQUIVALENT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SYSTEM WIDE WHICH MEANS OUR COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIO IS ABOUT ONE TO EVERY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVENTH. THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ACCOUNTANTS ARE WRITTEN RECOMMENDS THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MAINTAIN A RATIO OF ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL EVERY ONE THOUSAND TO ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. SO IF HE IF HE'S RATIO IS WAY ABOVE THE RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES. WHILE THESE NUMBERS REPRESENT THE PROBLEM AT HAND OUR STUDENTS LIVED EXPERIENCES ARE WHAT PERSONIFIES. THE NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION. THE REALITY A LACK OF FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. REPRESENTS SEE WHAT'S JUDY AT CAL STATE LA. WHO ISN'T ABLE TO ACT TIMELY. THAT COULD SAVE THEIR LIFE OR THE STUDENT AT HUMBOLDT STATE WHO'S COUNTING SESSIONS ARE CUT SHORT DUE TO LIMITED AVAILABILITY. PER STUDENT AT CAL STATE FULLERTON IT'S THE WEEKS OF WAITING FOR HELP ACT COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES. ULTIMATELY LEAD TO EXHAUSTION AND EFFECTIVE HELPLESSNESS LEADING TO ACADEMIC FAILURE. AND PER RESIDENTIAL ADVISER ACTING DIEGO STATE AND THAT HAVING TO CARE FOR STUDENT WITH CLINICAL DEPRESSION BECAUSE CAMPUS- ACCOUNTING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES. TURNED HER AWAY. STUDENTS FROM ACROSS OUR TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB IN PROMOTING EFFORTS TO DE STIGMATIZE. ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. TODAY'S SOCIETY PRESSURES THANK A GLOBAL HEALTH. I CAN UNCERTAINTY THE RISE IN RATES INJUSTICES AND UNSTABLE LIVING ENVIRONMENT. THE PRESSURES STUDENTS FACE NAY KOBE ON THE MID TERM EXAM OR CLASS PROJECT. THESE PRESSURES AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN OUR ACADEMIC MUCH WHAT'S OUR HOLISTIC WELLBEING. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT WE MUST ACT ON THE CRITICAL NEED TO EXPAND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW WE DO THIS. THE SOLUTION IS EIGHTY NINE FORTY CAMPUSES NEED ONGOING FUNDING TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADDRESS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS TO DATE AND TEN YEARS FROM NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND CLEAN SUPPORT EIGHTY NINE FORTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS. AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY I'M NOT THE RIGHT WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS BOX AT.

EIGHTY NINE FORTY WILL EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENT IN THE STATE. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE CSU. THESE SYSTEMS ARE NEARLY THREE MILLION STUDENTS. THEY ARE OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL NURSES TEACHERS AND CIVIC AND BUSINESS LEADERS. IF I INCREASE SAID ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNT HADN'T EXPECTED CARRYOVER BALANCE OF FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES WAITED FOR TEN STATES THAT PERSONAL INCOME TAX COLLECTIONS TRANSFERRED TO THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS JUST LAST MONTH ONE THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED. WE BELIEVE THE ADMIN SIDE CAN AND STUDENTS NEEDS WITHOUT ANY IMPACT TO OTHER NECESSARY PROGRAMS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS A BASIC NEED FOR OUR STUDENTS. LIKE HAVING FIFTY AND A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP EVEN IF NOTHING THAT FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO FULLY PREPARE STUDIES. AND COMPRISING. MEMBERS OF THE WORKFORCE. SH INSURANCE GAVE THEM AN ACT ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE. HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY AND THE DEMAND IS ONLY INCREASING. EIGHTY NINE FORTY WOULD ALLOW FOR THE HIRING OF ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS THE REDUCTION OF WEIGHT TIME EXPANDED PROGRAMMING AND SERVICES AND QUITE SIMPLY MORE ACCESS FOR STUDENTS TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED THAT. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THOSE YOUR RECORDING STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. AND THREE QUARTERS OF OUR LIFETIME MENTAL ILLNESS WILL BEGIN BY AGE TWENTY FOUR. ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH. IS AN IMPORTANT CAR AND STATE MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUUM OF CARE. AND COLLEGE CAMPUSES PRESENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TARGET A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. WITH A HOLISTIC SUPPORT THEY NEED. IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH HEALTHY RESPONSES STRAT. I'D LOVE TO IDENTIFY AND TREAT MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSES. ALL OF WHICH THAT STUDENTS ON THE PATH TO A HEALTHIER FUTURE. I THANK ROUGHLY HIGHLIGHTS AND- THAT THEY CAN BE I THINK NIGHT HEALTH.
