THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER SP FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR DIRECTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY GROUP TO STUDY THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION. THROUGH INTERNET BASED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND DRAFT A pTHE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION THROUGH PLATFORMS. THERE'S A CLEAR ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION. IN MARCH OF A TWENTY EIGHTEEN SCIENCE MAGAZINE REPORTED ON THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL DIFFUSION OF ALL OF THE VERIFY TRUE AND FALSE NEWS STORIES. DISTRIBUTED ON TWITTER FROM THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT FALSEHOODS DIFFUSED SIGNIFICANTLY FARTHER FASTER DEEPER AND MORE BROADLY THAN THE TRUTH IN ALL CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION. SINCE SOCIAL MEDIA MORE WEBSITES ON THE PLATFORMS FOR WHICH FALSE INFORMATION SPREADS IT IS GOING TO BECOME MORE IMPORTANT. THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE ALREADY COMING UP WITH PLANS TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION. THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW WHAT THOSE PLANS ARE AND IF THEY ARE WORKING. CONVENING A WORKING GROUP TO STUDY THE SPREAD A FALSE INFORMATION WILL BE THE FIRST STEP. IN WORKING TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM THE REAL THREATS AND HARM THAT CAN COME FROM FALSE INFORMATION. OUR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THEY WAS SPEAKING MEMBERS -- YOU WITH THIS BILL THE ONE THING THAT I WOULD. CAUTION IS ANYTIME AND CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN. INCIDENTS OF FALSE THINGS BEING SPREAD AROUND ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA AND AND WHAT'S TRANSPIRED WITH THAT BUT TO THEN HAVE THE GOVERNMENT START GAIN INTO THE BUSINESS OF DETERMINING WHAT. IS ACCURATE AND WHAT IS TRUE -- TO ME -- CAN BECOME PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE MANY TIMES ON SOME THE SUBJECTS THEY CAN BE PEOPLE CAN HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION. AND GOVERNMENTS TEND TO BE MORE POLITICAL -- AND I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE. ANYONE PARTY OR ANY -- ONE AGENCY. HAS -- HOLD ON THE TRUTH -- AND SO WE CAN GET IT CAN GET KIND OF PROBLEMATIC WHEN WE START PUTTING GOVERNMENT IN THAT POSITION WHAT WE WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS ENSURE. NOW WE HAVE AN EDUCATED POPULACE THAT CAN DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES -- WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS FALSE IN THAT CAN DISCERN FOR THEMSELVES -- WHAT IS YOU KNOW? WHAT IS BACKED BY FACTUAL INFORMATION WHAT IS NOT AND SO. I AM A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED BY THIS BILL IN THE DIRECTION IT'S TAKING IS STARTING TO PUT THAT. ON GOVERNMENT AND PUTTING GOVERNMENT IN THAT POSITION RATHER THAN LEAVING THAT TO PEOPLE. AND THE PUBLIC TO DO IT TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS AND THE AND THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS. TO EXPOSE THINGS THAT ARE FALSE TO EXPOSE THINGS THAT ARE WRONG. AND TO ACT ACCORDINGLY SO I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS DIRECTION THANK YOU. SURE MATHIS YOUR RECOMMENDS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS YOU KNOW THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION REMINDS ME OF OUR BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS -- NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY GEORGE ORWELL. IN A IN IN THEIR IT TALKS ABOUT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT MINISTRIES PERMISSION HURRIED. WITHOUT OBJECTION. THANK YOU ONE OF THESE MINISTRIES IS THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH. SHORTEN TO IN THEM MANY CHIU DEALING. WITH HISTORY ARE NEWS AND EDUCATION THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH AS A PROPAGANDA MACHINE. THE IRONY IS THAT. ALL IT DOES IS LAW. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH DOES TO ITS CITIZENS MEMBERS. LET'S NOT GO TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR ASK FOR NO VOTE. MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHORED BY ME WITHOUT OBJECTION. SO THIS WOULD CONVENE A WORKING GROUP RIGHT OKAY SO. MY QUESTION IS. WHO DECIDE LIKE WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND WHERE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE ON THIS WORKING GROUP WHAT WOULD -- ALLOW THEM TO BE CONSIDERED AS EXPERTS OR PROFESSIONALS IN THE AREA OF IDENTIFYING WHAT IS TRUE AND NOT TRUE. IN THE MEDIA. MISTER CHAU. OUR THE ADVISORY GROUP WILL ESSENTIALLY BE COMPOSED SO FAR AT LEAST ONE MEMBER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. ALL ONE MEMBER FROM THE INTERNET BASED SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDER. AND ALSO ONE MEMBER FROM THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCATE AS WELL AS A MEMBER FROM THE FIRST AMENDMENT SCHOLARS SO. SO YOU WILL HAVE A DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM ALL. WALKS OF LIFE ESSENTIALLY BASICALLY GETTING TOGETHER TO DETERMINE SOME OF THESE ISSUES WOULD NOT TRY TO COME UP WITH ACTUALLY. ARM. YOU KNOW RECOMMENDATION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT I THINK THIS IS A STUDY BILL IS ISOLATE. TO FIND OUT WHAT SOME OF THE POOR OF POTENTIAL ISSUES ARE SAID THAT THAT WE COULD. MAYBE TAKE NICK THAT STEPS ARE BASED UPON DOT. SOSA DOT THE THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS. BUT MISS MELENDEZ YOU MAY CONTINUE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER [inaudible] SO. BASED ON THAT DESCRIPTION IT DOESN'T SOUND AS THOUGH THAT PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE -- ARE ANY MORE QUALIFIED TO IDENTIFY. FALSE INFORMATION THAN ANYONE IN THIS ROOM -- I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S IT'S A WORKING GROUP BUT WITH WORKING GROUP CENTER ESTABLISH ALWAYS COME ALONG SOME OTHER LAW THAT FURTHER ESTABLISHES THE IS THIS GROUPING TO DECIDING WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS UNTRUE. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT. GIVEN WHAT I HAVE HEARD. THIS IS GOING TO BE A PANEL OF EXPERTS WHO CAN FOLLOW THROUGH ON ON THE DESIRE WHICH IS TO BE ABLE TO HELP IDENTIFYING TEACHER STUDENTS WHAT IS REAL. AND WHAT IS NOT REAL -- THAT I MEAN. RESPECTABLE PEOPLE WERE MENTIONED BUT NOT NECESSARILY QUALIFIED SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS REALLY IS THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM I THINK EVERYONE IN HERE WOULD AGREE. THAT THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH NEWS BEING DISPERSED OUT THERE THAT IS UNTRUE PART OF THAT COMES FROM -- AND I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THIS THE MEDIA WHO. IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BE FIRST -- AREN'T ALWAYS FACTUAL WHEN THEY FIRST GET A STORY OUT AND THAT'S A LOT OF TIMES HOW SOME OF THESE FAKE NEWS STORIES CAN PERPETUATE IS BECAUSE THEY START OFF YOU KNOW. THIS BAG END UP THIS BIG BUT I JUST I DON'T I DON'T HEAR. A COMPELLING ARGUMENT THAT THIS PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM I THINK -- MRS IS BETTER LEFT PERHAPS PERHAPS THE TECHNOLOGY INC INDUSTRIES IN THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AND TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT THERE CERTAINLY MORE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD THAT WE ARE SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR NO VOTE. DOCTOR QUIRK IRRITANTS -- I HAVE SOME COMMENTS THAT THE FLOOR MANAGER CAN ANSWERING HIS CLOSING. WHEN IS THIS BILL IS ARM? OPPOSED BY THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. OP WE ALREADY HAVE FACEBOOK AND OTHERS. DOING THEIR BEST TO KEEP -- AT LEAST. CLANDESTINE GROUPS OFF THEIR MEDIA. ARM I DON'T THINK WE NEED A GOVERNMENT AGENCY NOW -- TO COME UP WITH ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES I THINK WE SHOULD THINK IT'S TIME TO WAIT THANK YOU. DOCTOR CHOI YOUR RECOGNIZE. MEMBERS OF YOU LIKE TO SPEAK PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. DOCTOR CHOI. THANK YOU SPEAKER I HAVE ARE.

THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI SAYING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MISTER SHALL YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND I A I THINK THEY'RE ONE OF THE POINTS I WAS BEING REYES WAS EDUCATION. POINT BEING THAT WE NEED TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT THIS IS MERELY A STUDY BILL. A STUDY BILL TO LOOK AT A VERY REAL PROBLEM THAT HAS CREATED A THREAT TO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE TODAY. INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH. THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LIMITS ON SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE. YOU CANNOT SHOW FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE THIS BILL SIMPLY STIPULATE THAT THE GROUP WILL BE COMPRISED OF CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCATES AND FIRST AMENDMENT SCHOLARS THAT UNDERSTAND. FREE SPEECH RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONALITY PROTECTED SPEECH. WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM. AND FREE SPEECH WHAT RIGHTS MUST BE PROTECTED AS WE ALL KNOW. NOW CONVENING A WORKING GROUP WILL IN FACT BRING TOGETHER PEOPLE WILL HAVE A VAST ARRAY OF EXPERIENCE TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO FACE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I'VE.

THE IMAGE SPEAKER SP TWO TO ONE BANDS GUN SHOWS AT THE COW PALACE WHICH SIT ON THE BORDER OF DALY CITY. IN SAN FRANCISCO OF THE CAL PALACE HOST ABOUT FIVE GUN SHOWS A YEAR. THE BILL WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SO THAT ALL THE EXISTING CONTRACTS WOULD BE ABLE TO BE FOR FILLED. UP ALL THE GOVERNING BODIES WITHIN -- SAN FRANCISCO DALY CITY AS WELL AS SAN MATEO COUNTY HAVE ALL CALLED ON THE COW PALACE TO BAN. GUN SHOWS UNFORTUNATELY THE COW PALACE IS GOVERNED AS A STATE ENTITY SO THEREFORE WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS DISTRICT BILL. OUR DISTRICT TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE ALL BEEN VERY MUCH UNITED IN ASKING THAT THE COW PALACE NO LONGER HAVE ANY GUN SHOWS -- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR VOTE. THANK YOU MISS TANK YES VISIBLE AT THIS YEAR RECOGNIZE THINK MISTER SPEAKER I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHORED BY ME. WITHOUT OBJECTION -- IS THERE. IS THERE A SAFETY CONCERN -- RELATING TO THIS GUN SHOW WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS THE NUMBER OF DEATHS NUMBER YOU KNOW. WHAT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED AT THESE GUN SHOWS THAT HAS BEEN A PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS [inaudible] SO SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE DEBATE MISTER TAKE YOU MAY ADDRESS THAT I'M SORRY. MISTAKE WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS A QUESTION NOW STING -- AT THAT THIS POINT THE COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY SURROUNDING THE CAL PALACE WHICH ARE BOTH SAN FRANCISCO DALY CITY HAVE. UNANIMOUSLY UNIFORMLY ASK FOR THE CAL PALACE NOT TO SHOW NOT NOT TO HAVE -- THESE GUN SHOWS THAT AT THIS POINT I HAVEN'T BEEN MADE AWARE OF ANY. SPECIFIC INCIDENTS BUT THERE IS A FEELING WITH THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY GUNS ARE IN THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD SO THEY THEY REALLY. ARE FROM MATTER OF FARM. POLICY REALLY DON'T WANT THE COW PALACE TO BE HAVING ANY MORE CONSCIOUS [inaudible] THIS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU I AM ON MY OWN TIME AND WHAT'S GOING ON TO MAKE FRIENDS TODAY -- I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE AND THEN IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH THERE HASN'T NECESSARILY BEEN ANY. PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES WITH THIS GUN SHOW BEING HELD BUT MORE THAT -- IT'S A IT'S IT'S A FEELING OF THEIR FOLKS WERE AND YOU JUST DON'T WANT THEM THERE WHICH I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE ARE OTHER EVENTS GOING ON IN SOME OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS IN CITIES WHERE THEY DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THOSE EVENTS -- HOWEVER IT'S IT'S THEIR RIGHT -- TO EXERCISE WHETHER IT'S AT A GUN SHOW OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF ON THE VENT WITH. WITH WITH WHICH ONE DISAGREES SO GIVEN THAT THERE IS NO SAFETY CONCERN. WITH THE GUN SHOW BEING HELD AT THE COW PALACE -- I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT FOR FOR THEM TO HAVE THIS SHOW AND UNTIL THERE'S A SOME SORT OF PUBLIC SAFETY MATTER AT HAND -- ALLOW THE SHOW TO CONTINUE TO GO ON A FAMOUS ONE AS MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I REGRETFULLY HAVE TO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB -- TWO TO ONE THIS BILL AND ITS PROHIBITION. WILL NOT ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY AS THE CURRENT LAW ALREADY REQUIRES ALL FIREARM TRANSACTIONS AT THE COW PALACE OR ANY OTHER. GUN SHOW LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA TO MEET THE SAME STRINGENT STANDARDS AS REQUIRED IN THE DEALER STORE. INDEED WHEREVER A FIREARMS TRANSACTION COMMENCES STATE LAW MANDATES A WAITING PERIOD REINFORCED IN THE FIREARM REMAIN. IN THE POSSESSION OF THE TRANSACTING DEALER UNTIL THAT PERIOD ENDS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS COMPLETED THE REQUIRED BACKGROUND CHECK. THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT THE CAL POLICY IS A DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION. WHICH RECEIVES MINIMAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE BUDGET. IT LIKE OTHER DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS INCLUDING IN MY DISTRICT THAT MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS. IN CALIFORNIA ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE THEIR OWN REVENUES FROM TRADE SHOWS LIVESTOCK AUCTIONS CONCERTS AT CENTER. PROHIBITING GUNS JONES AT THE COW PALACE NOT ONLY ELIMINATES A LEGAL VENUE FOR THE SALE OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.

SENATE ELEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR PORTANTINO ACTUALLY FIREARMS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MANY SPEAKER THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT BILL. AND WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS BRING PARITY THE HANDGUN LAW BILL. ANY QUIP THAT TO WHAT WE NOW DO WITH LONG WHAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITH LONG GUNS WHICH IS THAT NOBODY SHOULD BY. MORE THAN ONE LONG GUN PER THIRTY DAYS NOW THERE ARE SOME EXEMPTIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT. STATE LOCAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. LICENSE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES. PRIVATE PARTY TRANSACTIONS I AND FIREARMS DEALERS AMONG OTHERS IS RESPONSIBLE BILL. AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVAL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. SO. HERE YOU GO WITH ANOTHER GUN CONTROL BILL FROM MY FRIEND ACROSS THE AISLE OVER THERE -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS Y. GUESS FIRST CAN I ASK A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR BEFORE CONTINUE WITH MY COMMENTS [inaudible] WITHOUT OBJECTION. IS IT DO HOUSE OF DATA OR STATISTIC STATISTICS TO SHOW THAT -- THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN CRIME -- USING RIFLES OR OR LONG GUNS. I WILL ALLOW HIM TO REDRESS THIS NOW OR AS CLOSE. BUT I'D LIKE TO INTERJECT THAT NOW YOU'LL ADDRESS IT AND IS CLOSE THAT AS HIS* HIS -- YOU WANT TO DO IT IN YOUR CLOTHES HE DOESN'T ANSWER IT NOW. OKAY WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE OKAY SO AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THERE IS NO DATA TO SUGGEST THAT IF THERE HAS BEEN NECESSARILY AN INCREASE THAT WOULD WARRANT THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CRIME STATISTICS. DIRECTLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WEBSITE YOU WILL SEE THAT THE MAJORITY OF HOMICIDES CENTER COMMITTEE GEORGE MAJORITY OF GUN VIOLENCE HAS COMMITTED IS WITH A HANDGUN. NOT WITH THE RIFLE OR LONGER. IN FACT IT'S ABOUT 85%. THAT IS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WEBSITE SO IN MY VIEW THIS BILL IS. LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST AND THERE IS ALREADY A PROHIBITION ON PURCHASING MORE THAN ONE HANDGUN IN THIRTY DAYS THAT HAS BEEN LOST SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY WE DO NOT HAVE A NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF BILL BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE INCREASE THAT WOULD WARRANT THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION FOR FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK SOME OVER SANTIAGO YOU MAY CLOSE. I THINK AMEND SPEAKER AND I APPRECIATE THE DEBATES UP BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE. I BELIEVE ALONG WITH THE AUTHOR THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE. OUTSIDE OF THE EXEMPTIONS OF MORE THAN ONE LONG GONE OUT PER MONTH AND WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. NOW WHEN I DID THIS BILL SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IT PASSED THIS CHAMBER AYE HANDEDLY. WE HAD UNCOVERED THAT THERE WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL I AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THAT HAD BOUGHT MORE THAN I BELIEVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR LONG GUNS. NO ONE NEEDS A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR NO ONE NEEDS TO HUNDRED OF THESE THINGS TENDED THESE THINGS OR THIRTY THE THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE EXEMPTIONS THAT WE'VE JUST STATED. I TO ME IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I BELIEVE IT INCREASES THE ABILITY THE GUN TRAFFIC AND THERE IS SOME DATA THAT SHOWS THAT A LOT OF THAT SOMEBODY MASS SHOOTINGS HAVE NOW BEEN -- DONE BY LONG GUNS AND THE SOME SOME OF THESE GUNS ON MAY HAVE BEEN IN FACT -- PARTICIPATING. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WITHOUT MADAM CLERK PLEASE OPEN THE ROLL-ON MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE.

IT REQUIRES THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE MICHAEL PLASTIC STRATEGY ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER.

MADAM CLERK YOU MAY CLOSE THE ROLE ON TELLY THE VOTES AYE SIXTY TWO NO ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WE ARE MOVING BACK AND FILE ORDER. TO ITEM TWO THIRTY THREE SB ELEVEN FIFTY TWO MATTER PARK PLEASE PLEASE READ SET UP ELEVEN FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR HERNANDEZ AND ACT [inaudible] LOOK HEALTH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT S. B.. ELEVEN FIFTY TWO SB ELEVEN FIFTY TWO IS ONE SMALL BUT IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. RESPONSE TO RECENT CASES OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS BEING DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITALS LEFT AT BUS STOPS OR SHELTERS. THAT ARE UNABLE TO SERVE THEM. SOMETIMES WEARING ONLY A HOSPITAL GREAT DOWN WITH NO WHERE TO GO. THIS BILL REFLECTS THE NEEDS FOR POSSIBLE TO BE PARTNERS IN COMPASSIONATE TREATMENT OF HOMELESS PATIENTS. WE FACE TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS AND HAVING ADEQUATE HOUSING AND SOCIAL SERVICES RESOURCES. THE BILL PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND MEET THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS HAVE TAKEN MANY MANY AMENDMENTS OVER TWENTY FIVE IN FACT TO INSURE THAT THIS BILL CAN BE IMPLEMENTED BY BOTH HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITIES. THE BILL NOW ALLOWS NONCLINICAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS OFFERING CLOSER A MEAL TO BE DONE IN A NON CLINICAL AREA THE HOSPITAL SUCH AS A WAITING ROOM OR CAFETERIA. IN ADDITION THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO PERU TO REMOVE PROVISIONS THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED IN LONGER HOSPITAL STAYS. INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT THAT PATIENTS BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN THE HOSPITAL UNTIL DAYLIGHT HOURS. IT ONLY REQUIRES HOSPITALS IDENTIFIES SHELTER PLACEMENT WERE AVAILABLE INTO OTHERWISE HELP THE PATIENT TO RETURN TO A LOCATION THAT IS FAMILIAR TO THEM. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THIS POPULATION RESOURCES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN ALL CASES SO THIS BILL NOW REQUIRES HOSPITALS. TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO COORDINATE WITH APPROPRIATE PROVIDERS. I BELIEVE THAT S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY TWO IS A REASONABLE APPROACH TO IT DIFFICULT PROBLEM. WITH THIS MEASURE CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER IN FINDING COMPASSIONATE SOLUTIONS AND TREATING EVERY PERSON WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SEEING A REQUEST TO SPEAK MADAM CLERK PLEASE OPEN THE ROLE I'M SORRY I'M SORRY. PLEASE CLOSE THE ROLE I SEE SOMEBODY WAVING IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARAMBULA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. ELEVEN FIFTY TWO AS A POSITION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT I'VE EXPERIENCED THE DILEMMAS AND CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH. TREATING SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AS DOCTORS WE PROVIDE ALL THE MEDICAL CARE THAT WE CAN TO SAID A PERSON ON THE ROAD TO HEALTH AND RECOVERY. HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL OFTEN BECOMES. A THE BIGGER TO DETERMINES TO WHETHER A PERSON RECOVERS WELL. WHETHER THE PERSON HAS A PLACE TO LIVE OR FOOD TO EAT IS INSTRUMENTAL. DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS CANNOT SOLVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS BUT WE ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION. SENATE BILL ELEVEN FIFTY TWO PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR BASIC STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN WHEN THE PERSON WHO IS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS PASSES THROUGH OUR CARE. IT ALSO PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY SPUR HOSPITALS PHYSICIANS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. TO PROVIDE THOSE ESSENTIAL BUT NON CLINICAL SERVICES IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT IMPEDE PATIENT FLOW OR CROWD OUR FACILITIES. FURTHERMORE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE KERN WHO ARE CONNECTED TO PRIMARY CARE TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND SHELTER ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO FREQUENT AND TO RETURN TO OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. I BELIEVE THAT SENATE BILL ELEVEN FIFTY TWO IS A REASONABLE MEASURE WHICH RECOGNIZES THE DIGNITY AND HUMANITY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTES TODAY. THANK YOU SO MEMBER WOULD YOU WANT HOPE I NOW SEE ANOTHER MIKE UP MEMBERS PLEASE PUT YOUR MYSELF HE WAS. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY ORECK.

AND I THINK IT'S IT'S TIME THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THEY A STATEWIDE SOLUTION WE KNOW THE HOSPITALS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING. TO PICK ON HOSPITALS WE MUST COUNT ON HOUSE WILL BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND REQUIRING THAT LET THE HOSPITAL STEP BUT IS THAT CERTAINLY WISE HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE ONE POSSIBLE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE AND ARE HOMELESS. ANOTHER HAS A A TRIAGE CENTER WITH RESPITE BEDS FUNDED IN THE COMMUNITY BUT WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY BREAKDOWNS AND COMMUNICATIONS AND TWO EXAMPLES ARE FRANKLY.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER -- MEMBERS THIS BILL IS BACK. THE PROBLEM IS THE CHANGE THAT NEEDED TO BE MADE WASN'T MADE WHICH IS. IT SET THE BILL SAYS IT IT WILL NOT REQUIRE THAT MORE THAN SIXTEEN HOURS OF TRAINING -- BE IMPOSED ON CCW HOLDERS IT DOESN'T TAKE CAN'T BE MORE THAN THAT IT JUST SAYS YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED. TO MAKE IT SIXTEEN HOURS MEANING. YOU COULD HAVE A COUNTY THAT MAKES IT. TWENTY HOURS OR FORTY HOURS ARE HUNDRED EIGHTY HOURS. THAT'S THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A CAP -- SO FOR THAT REASON I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU SEEING NO FOR THE REQUEST TO SPEAK ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I AM SORRY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MENACE SUGAR QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. HAVE YOU EVER A TRAINED ON ANY FIREARMS. YOU CAN ANSWER NOW OR IN YOUR CLOTHES.

IT IS MORE LIKE ON THANK YOU ON ON MY OWN TIME I JUST YOU KNOW BEING A SOME OF THOSE IN THE MILITARY THAT WAS ON IN A TRAINED FOR TEN YEARS PEOPLE ON FIREARMS. A F. FIND IT REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE CONTINUE TO GO AFTER ALL. CCW IS EXPRESSLY BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY TRAINING MECHANISM IN PLACE. AND YOU KNOW THESE BILLS IT IS WE'RE GONNA SECOND OR AS WE GET INTO THESE THINGS. THE USER THE LEAST AMOUNT. OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE PROBLEMS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT ON THE STREETS THEY'RE DOING THINGS ILLEGALLY. THESE ARE THE ONES THAT GO THROUGH THE HIDEOUS PRACTICES TO GO THROUGH EVERY SINGLE. THING THAT THEY'RE ASKED TO JUMP THROUGH. SO THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY BUT YEAH AS A BODY. WE SEEM TO CONTINUE TO GO AFTER THEM ON LET'S JUST ADD ONE MORE THING ONE MORE THING ONE MORE THING. SO THE AGAIN MY QUESTION GOES TO I'M I'M INTERESTED IN THE AUTHORS -- TRAINING IN HIS BACKGROUND ON ON ACTUALLY KNOWING ABOUT WEAPONS IN THE TRAINING -- WHILE HE'S RUNNING THIS LEGISLATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC. TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP ADDING BURDENS TO IT. AND OF COURSE MY COLLEAGUES RAISE THEIR MICROPHONES YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO DEBATE THESE THINGS THAT'S WHAT THE FLOOR.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE OH THREE I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR THIS EXCELLENT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I JUST RISE WITH THE PERSPECTIVE OF A PARENT AND SOMEBODY WHO'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISE AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY I THINK THAT. A LOT OF US THINK AND FEEL THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO A CRACKDOWN ON GUN VIOLENCE AND I THINK THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT WE KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE ARE COMMON SENSE MEASURES THAT FOLKS ARE TAKING AND I THINK THAT WHEN THERE'S RESISTANCE TO COMMONSENSE MEASURES IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING. THAT'S TRYING TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S FIREARMS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TRYING TO IMPOSE ON REASONABLE STANDARDS ON FOLKS THIS IS A COMMONSENSE PROCEDURE THAT'S GONNA PUT CALIFORNIA LINE WITH TWENTY FIVE OTHER STATES. THAT ALREADY REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS TO RECEIVE LIVE FIRE TRAINING AND SO IN THE SPIRIT OF PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN ARE PROTECTING OUR CITIZENS I RESPECTFULLY OCCUR CHEN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER OUT YOU KNOW THIS MEASURE IS NOT -- PUT FORWARD AS WAS NOTED AS A FEEL GOOD MEASURE THIS WAS BORN OUT OF RESEARCH FROM OUR STATE AUDITOR. TWO YEARS AGO I ASKED STATE AUDITOR TO LOOK INTO THREE COUNTIES AT THE CCW PRACTICES RELATED. TO TRAINING -- FEES WHETHER NOT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE SUBSIDIZING THESE PROGRAMS. AND THE STATE ARE CAME OUT WITH A REPORT ABOUT A YEAR AGO LOOKING AT THREE COUNTIES SHOWING THAT IN MANY INSTANCES INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. LA AND SAN DIEGO POLICIES THAT'S WEREN'T CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW AND THE BACKGROUND AND TRAINING ELEMENTS TO THESE -- WERE BASICALLY AT NOT UP TO PAR AND SO THIS MEASURE IT TAKES INTO THESE BEST PRACTICES AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE A STATEWIDE UNIFORM PROCESS RELATED. TO SEE CW'S ARE THE LAW OF THE LAND WE HAVE ANOTHER DEBATE IN THEIR DAY ABOUT THAT BUT THE MINUTE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A MINIMUM -- TRAINING A THRESHOLD FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO GET THESE LICENSES MAKE YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALLEN YOU'RE RIGHT [inaudible] THE OTHER. WITHOUT OBJECTION I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO HIM AS TO WHAT THEIR ANSWERS NOW OUR DISCLOSE DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW HOW MANY VIOLENT CRIMES WERE COMMITTED BY CCW HOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. I THOUGHT MY HEAD SIR BUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS I'LL TELL YOU THE ANSWER THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY. ZERO ZERO CRIMES ARE COMMITTED LAST YEAR BY HOLDERS OF C. CW'S IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WOULD ASK SECOND QUESTION THE AUTHOR HEY THIS IS NOT A DEBATE YOU CAN ASK HIM HE CAN REPLY AND HIS CLOTHES MADAM CHAIR I'M NOT DEBATING I'M SIMPLY ASKING A QUESTION AND ACTUALLY. I WOULD I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT YOU SPOKE FROM TULARE THAT THAT FLOOR IS ACTUALLY WHERE DEBATE. IS SUPPOSED TO BE HELD FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE LIVE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC WHERE THIS IS THE FLOOR THE PEOPLE SPEAK AND THIS IS THE FORWARD DEBATE IN THIS ALLEN YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY DEBATE WITHIN YOUR FIVE MINUTES. BUT YOU WITH THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR CROSS EXAMINATION OR HUMAN A YOU CAN ASK ME YEAH THEY ARE NOT ACQUIRE ITEMS I DO APPRECIATE THAT BUT I CHOOSE NOT TO DEBATE WITH MYSELF. I THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FLOOR DEBATE IS HELD BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THIS BODY SO WITH WITH YOUR INDULGENCE. OUR QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS HAVE AN INVIOLABLE RIGHT. TO BEAR ARMS AS GIVEN THEM BY THE U. S. CONSTITUTION THAT SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. ADDRESS IN MY CLOTHES MISS. WE CAN RESPOND AND IN HIS DEBATE IN HIS CLOSING. WELL YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO BE DEBATING WITH YOURSELF BUT WE'LL BE WATCHING ON YOUTUBE AS YOU MISS MISTAKENLY SPOKE. AND SAID YOU THOUGHT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF CRIME THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY CCW HOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. YOUR ACTUALLY CORRECT MY FRIEND THERE BEEN ZERO NOW I WILL TELL YOU FOR ONE THAT I DO BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS WALLS ALL U. S. CITIZENS. HAVE AN INVIOLABLE RIGHT GUARANTEED BY THE U. S. CONSTITUTION TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS WHICH SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED. I IN THE CZW OLDER MYSELF AND I CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE MY OWN RIGHTS INFRINGED YES I DID GO THROUGH TRAINING CLASS YES I AM LICENSE AND YES I AM REGISTERED. I THINK THAT IN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AS THIS BODY WOULD TRY TO PUT ON LAW ABIDING CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND BY THE WAY. LET ME ALSO REFLECT THE CCW CALIFORNIA IS PROBABLY THE SAFEST PERSON YOU WERE EVER GOING TO FIND OUTSIDE OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. I PRAY TO GOD THAT THERE'S A CCW HOLDER WALKING ON EVERY SINGLE STREET EVERY SINGLE CD EVERY SINGLE TOWN EVERY SINGLE DAY AND NIGHT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT MAKE US SAFER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IS MINUTES AWAY. SO WITH THAT I WOULD SAY THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ARE KEEPING US SAFE. AS BORNE OUT BY THE EVIDENCE ZERO VIOLENT CRIMES AND MANY CRIMES HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY VALID HOLDERS OF CZW IS DOING THERE EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. AND PEOPLE AROUND THEM FROM VIOLET INJURY AND VIOLENT THREAT I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS AND I WOULD REINFORCE THE COMMENTS OF THE MEMBER FROM TULARE I THINK USE EXACTLY SPOT ON AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERY SINGLE MEMBER. IN THIS BODY TO REMEMBER WHAT THE U. S. CONSTITUTION ACTUALLY STANDS FOR AND THAT'S THE RULE OF LAW ARJUNA VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBER SAYA. FIRST I I ACTUALLY HAVE A CCW. I SUPPORTED THIS BILL. AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL AGAIN. MOST OF US TO CARRY THOSE ARE ALREADY DOING EIGHT HOUR COURSE I THINK THAT THERE IS THAT WHAT'S BEING MISSED HERE. IS THAT WE HAVE. LILY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CRIMINALS THAT ARE FELONS OUT THERE. THAT HAVE GUNS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER WE'RE MAKING IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE WHO. OUR CHINA BY THE LAW MAKE IT HARDER TO ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW WE'RE PUTTING MORE BURDEN ON THEM WHO ARE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS YOU CANNOT GET A CCW WITHOUT YOUR SHARE OF SIGNING OFF OF IT IN YOUR COUNTY. AFTER YOU WENT TO ALL THAT THE COURSES SO FOR ME THIS IS JUST ANOTHER LAYER OF ADDING MORE. BUREAUCRACY WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE BUT I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON IS THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CRIMINALS THAT ARE OUT THERE WITH GUNS THAT WE SHOULD GO AFTER SAID A PASSING LAWS THAT MOST SHERIFFS ALREADY DO. ARGENEAU AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU I'M NOT SAYING ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IN A MY COLLEAGUES FOR RAISING VOICES BOTH IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. NO NATURALLY. TO TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF WHAT WAS MENTIONED YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL ABOUT INDIVIDUALS RIGHT TO CARRY A GUN -- IS NOT MY BUSINESS IT'S THAT IT THAT IT IS A RIGHT IN WITHIN THE U. S. CONSTITUTION SO QUESTION A STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ARE RELEVANT TO THIS DEBATE. I THINK I WANT ALSO POINT OUT OF FOR THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM BY CELIA QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES OF WITH GUNS I WILL TELL YOU -- MY COLLEAGUE I WAS ON THE VARSITY RIFLE TEAM FRESHMAN YEAR HIGH SCHOOL SPENT FOUR YEARS -- US PRETTY DARN GOOD AT DOING THAT. AND I DID IT BECAUSE I WAS TRAINED BY SOMEONE WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING I WAS NOT GIVEN A FIREARM AND SENT FORTH OUT INTO THE WORLD. I WAS GIVEN PROPER TRAINING FRESHMAN YEAR VARSITY THAT WAS ME THAT WAS THE ONLY SPORT I COULD EVER POSSIBLY LETTER AND I ONE OF MY MY COLLEAGUES NO THAT. SO PLEASE DO NOT ASSUME THAT I DON'T UNDERSTANDING ABOUT FIRE ARMS BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE WRONG IN THE SAME WAY THAT I'M NOT GONNA JUDGE YOU FOR HAVING A CCW PERMIT. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A LOADED GUN IN PUBLIC. YOU NEED TO SHOW THAT YOU'VE KNOWN WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NOT UNIFORM RULES AROUND THIS THERE ARE COUNTIES THAT ARE LACKS. IN THEIR DISTRIBUTION OF THESE PERMITS NOW I WOULD SAY MORE POORLY THE WEATHER NOT TODD GLORIA KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT FIREARMS YOU KNOW DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES THEY SUPPORT THIS BILL THE POLICE CHIEF AND THE SHERIFFS HAVE ENDORSED A YES POSITION ON THIS.

AS A HARM REDUCTION PREVENTATIVE MEASURE TO HELP PEOPLE GET INTO TREATMENT AND TO SAVE LIVES A LITTLE BIT LONGER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN MISTER ALLEN HERE RECOGNIZE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR [inaudible] WITHOUT OBJECTION. HOUSE IS NOT LEGALIZED HEROIN INJECTIONS ENTERS THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- ANSWER MY CLOTHES [inaudible] THIS ROUND. ON MY OWN TIME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHAT IS HAPPENING BEFORE YOU IS THE DESTRUCTION. OF VALUES THAT WE HOLD DEAR ACROSS CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY [inaudible] EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT LEGALIZED HEROIN INJECTION CENTERS IS A BAD IDEA AND IT'S NOT JUST A BAD IDEA IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. DON'T LET THE BILL'S AUTHOR AND THE BILL'S PROPONENTS TRY TO TELL YOU THIS IS JUST ABOUT OVERDOSING. THIS IS ABOUT HAVING LEGALIZED HEROIN EJECTION CENTERS. THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND IT STARTS THERE. AND THEN WILL SPREAD TO THE REST OF THE STATE. I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THIS IS HOW IT STARTS. YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN. THE OPEN DRUG POLICY. OF MANY MEMBERS ON THIS FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THERE'S MANY CALIFORNIANS. THAT ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PERSONAL DRUG USE. BUT THE STUDIES ARE CLEAR THIS STUDY SHOW. THE HEROIN USE DOES NOT HAVE GOOD CONSEQUENCES. AND JUST BECAUSE THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO SANCTION NOT ONE BUT TO LEGALIZE HEROIN INJECTION CENTERS IN JULY OF THIS YEAR. DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT DOESN'T MAKE A GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITIES AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MAKE IT LEGAL. THESE ARE STILL ILLEGALLY OPERATED SITES WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE SANCTIONED BY CITY REGULATION OR STATE LAW. SAY NO TO HEAR AN EJECTION CENTERS IN SAN FRANCISCO SEE NOTE HERE INJECTION CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND SAY NO TO THIS BILL. MS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM STANDING IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE EIGHTY SIX WE ALL COMPLAIN ABOUT THE OAK OPIATE EPIDEMIC BUT YET WE WANT -- OTHER PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT EPIDEMIC SAN FRANCISCO HAVE SPED UP. I SPOKE TO THE MAYOR PERSONALLY AND SHE SAID IF YOU GUYS DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. AND OTHER COUNTIES I'M WILLING TO GIVE IT A TRY SHE LOST HER SISTER TO AN OVERDOSE AND SHE SAID THAT SHE IS WILLING TO BE THE GUINEA PIG FOR THIS PROGRAM. BECAUSE 418% OF THE FOLKS THAT ENTERED THOSE FACILITIES GOT OFF DRUGS AND SHE IS WILLING TO STAND UP FOR THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN AND TRY THIS PROGRAM IT IT WORKS. WE CAN EXPAND IT TO OTHER PLACES IN THE IN CALIFORNIA AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK WILL SCRAP IT AND START ALL OVER AGAIN. IF WE TRULY ARE. VESTED IN SAVING FOLKS FROM OVERDOSE AND FROM DRUGS WE HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS NOT WORKING. WE NEED. TO REALLY STEP UP AND HELP OTHER FOLKS THAT WANT TO TRY THESE PROGRAMS SO WITH THAT I STRONGLY SUPPORT AB ONE EIGHTY SIX AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- I CERTAINLY SHARE THE CONCERN THAT THE AUTHOR HAS WITH RESPECT TO TO DRUG USE THAN IT IS AN EPIDEMIC AND IT CERTAINLY IS A PROBLEM SAN FRANCISCO IF ANYONE'S BEEN THERE RECENTLY I THINK THEY COULD SEE THAT FOR THEMSELVES -- THE ISSUE ISN'T THAT WE WANT. THAT WE DISAGREE ON PEOPLE AND YOU'RE SAVING THEM FROM OVERDOSING THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE MY CONCERN IS THERE IS THERE'S NOTHING BAKED INTO THE IN A SENSE THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT -- REQUIRES ANY SORT OF DRUG TREATMENT SO. BY HAVING THIS TYPE OF FACILITY AVAILABLE. AND REMEMBER PUBLIC RESOURCES WILL BE USED A MAYBE NOT IN FUNDING THE PERSONALLY BUT CERTAINLY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE TO COME UP RIGHT TREATMENT BUT IT'S IT'S ENCOURAGING PROLONGED USE AB DRUGS IT'S IT'S SORT OF PERPETUATING ADDICTION WHICH IS KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE WANNA DO WE WANT THEM -- TO TO GET OFF OF THESEDRUGS AND GET THEIR LIVES TURNED AROUND AND BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND NOT NEED THIS THIS TYPE OF HELP SO I DON'T SEE HOW. OPENING THIS KIND OF CENTER WHICH MAY KEEP THEM FROM OVERDOSING AND ULTIMATELY DYING IT. WILL STILL KEEP THEM ON DRUGS AND PARTICULARLY THESE TYPES OF DRUGS THEY MAY NOT DIE FROM AN OVERDOSE. BUT THEY'RE VERY LIKELY GOING TO DIE FROM OTHER COMPLICATIONS OTHER HEALTH RELATED COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROLONGED USE OF THESE TYPES OF DRUGS SO FOR THAT REASON I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK HEAVENS MELENDEZ DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THE SCIENCE FIRMLY DEMONSTRATES THAT THESE PROGRAMS PREVENT NEEDLESS DEATH DISEASE AND SUFFERING. ACCORDING TO A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF ADDICTION OF THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS IN VANCOUVER CANADA CANADA. BRITISH COLUMBIA WHERE 30% MORE LIKELY TO ENTER DRUG TREATMENT HAD HAVE HIGHER RATES OF DRUG TREATMENT COMPLETION. AND SIMILAR DRUG USERS WHO DID NOT ATTEND THE PROGRAM AN ADDICTION SPECIALIST DESCRIBE THESE OUTCOMES AS ASTOUNDING. DOWNEY LEE GOOD. IN ONE OF THE BILL'S POLICY COMMITTEES HEARINGS THIS YEAR. WE SHOULD ALLOW SAN FRANCISCO THE DISCRETION TO PILOT THESE PROMISING PRACTICES AND GET MORE PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT PROGRAMS WITH THE GOAL OF TURNING LIVES AROUND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOOD. MISTER CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LME FOR START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL -- FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD AND RESPONDING TO SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- THE THOUGHT AND DELIBERATION. BOB THERE WAS A SUGGESTION MADE OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT TREATMENT AND I WOULD LIKE. TO SUGGEST EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE SUPERVISE LOCATIONS ARE MEANT TO HELP GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT IT'S ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO A SAFE LOCATION. PROVIDING ONE ON ONE CONTACT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT AND ONTO A BETTER PATH OF LIFE. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS ARE THIS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN CANADA IN AUSTRALIA AND EUROPE WHO'VE SEEN DROPS IN OVERDOSE DEATHS HIV AND HEPATITIS C. TRANSMISSION. AND GENERAL PUBLIC DISORDER AND NUISANCE ASSOCIATED WITH DRUGS GO DOWN AS WELL AS A GREATER UPTAKE IN DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENTS ARE THAT IS FAR BETTER THAN LEAVING PEOPLE ALONE ON THE STREETS. OUR CITY HAS ESTIMATED THAT THESE -- THIS POTENTIAL PILOT COULD SAVE US MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN MEDICAL COSTS. AND LET ME SAY THIS WE HAVE PEOPLE. NOT JUST IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE DYING ON OUR STREETS WHO ARE DYING IN THE STREETS WE NEED TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE. AND WITH THAT WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS PILOT PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN TEST SAYS AND IF IT WORKS. WE CAN SEE ARE THE SAVINGS BUT OF COURSE THE IMPACT ON HUMAN LIVES WITH THAT RESPECT WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THEY CAN BE SURE. THANK YOU MEMBERS. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. DOCTOR EGGMAN YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL DEBATE AND I AND I AM HEARTENED. UP BY THE EVOLUTION I THINK THAT WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. THING WAS THREE YEARS AGO WE COULDN'T GET A VOTE OUT OF OUR FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE SEEN COUNTLESS PEOPLE DIE ON THE STREETS WE'VE SEEN HEPATITIS GO UP. RECEIVE HIV GOES UP WE'VE SEEN ISSUES ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMELESSNESS A LOT OF THE ILLS THAT WE SEE ON THE STREETS CONTINUE TO GO UP. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I HAD THE AYE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF ATTENDING A FRIEND'S FUNERAL THIS WEEKEND. THIS WEEK UP CHOOSE FORTY SIX TO PHD PROFESSOR. A DIET ON A FAMILY VACATION -- AND IN DURING THE SERVICE. WE TALK ABOUT HER USE OF HER DEGREE AND OF TELLING STORIES OF MARGINALIZED PEOPLE. OFTENTIMES IN HISTORY BOOKS IT'S THE FAMOUS PEOPLE IT'S A BRIDGE IN THAT THE POWERFUL BUT OFTENTIMES IS NOT THE EVERYDAY PEOPLE THE SEAMSTRESS. PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS PEOPLE ARE SERVING OUR FOOD ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE UP THE FABRIC OF OUR LIVES OF OUR WORLD OF OUR SOCIETY. AND I GUESS WHEN I WAS SITTING IN THERE I WAS THINKING ABOUT DO I YOU KNOW DO I DO I DO ENOUGH. IN THE USE OF MY OWN PRIVILEGE OF EDUCATION I HAVE [inaudible] AND PEOPLE. WHEN I ASKED ABOUT BEFORE ABOUT GUN SO I HIGH HAPPEN HAVE A PEACH PHD IN SOCIAL WORK AND SOCIAL RESEARCH? WE STUDY SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE GO ABOUT SOLVING THESE ISSUES. I ONE OF THE THINGS AND I KNOW THAT WE DO IS WE DO WITH COMPASSION. WE NEED PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND WE SAY THAT EVERY LIFE MATTERS. EVERY LIFE MATTERS MEMBER WHO ARE WE IF WE'RE NOT PASSING LAWS FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RISE TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL DO I AGREE DRUGS ARE BAD YES I AGREE BUT DO I THINK THAT JUST SAYING NO HAS HELPED. NO IT HASN'T HELPED MEMBERS AND WE STILL SEE THE EPIDEMIC WE OWE IT TO PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM ONE MORE CHANCE TO GET HELP. ONE MORE CHANCE TO GET INTO TREATMENT TO SAVE MONEY TO SAVE LIVES AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WITH THAT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLL-ON MEMBERS. WHAT IS THERE TO VOTE?
