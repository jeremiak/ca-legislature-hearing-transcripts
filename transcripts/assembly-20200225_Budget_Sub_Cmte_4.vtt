00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.220
ONE OF THE KEY RESPONSIBILITY.

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:57.355
IS LICENSING OR THREE SEPARATE

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:58.757
DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE ROLES

00:25:58.823 --> 00:26:00.125
CURRENTLY FOR LICENSING

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:02.193
CANNABIS BUSINESSES- YOU'LL

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.061
HEAR FROM THOSE DEPARTMENT

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:05.163
SHORTLY. ONE OF THEM IS THE

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.197
PURE OF CANNABIS CONTROL WITHIN

00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:07.799
THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:09.968
AFFAIRS THERE'S ALSO THIS WHEN

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:10.835
THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.237
AGRICULTURE AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.439
OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO THEY

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:16.808
REGULATE RETAILERS DISTRIBUTORS

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:20.245
CULTIVATORS AND MANUFACTURERS.

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.713
SO PROPERTY FOR ALSO

ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF TAXING.

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:24.983
TYPICALLY TO STATE EXCISE

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.885
TAXES. I THOSE ARE ADMINISTERED

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:28.286
BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION SO

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:32.457
THE FIRST TAXES A 15% TAX. ON

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:34.826
RETAIL GROSS RECEIPTS WE I

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:36.061
REFER TO THAT OFTEN AS THE

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:37.562
RETAIL EXCISE TAX. AND THE

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:39.798
SECOND IS A WEIGHT BASED TAX-

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:41.700
WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:42.801
THE CULTIVATION TAX. IF YOU

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:43.735
TURN THE PAGE TWO OF A HAND

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:46.604
OUT- WE KNOW THE CULTIVATORS

00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:48.373
AND RETAILERS BET BEAR THE

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.607
LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:51.209
ADMITTING THE TO TAXES I

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.877
MENTIONED THAT CULTIVATION IN

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:55.246
RETAIL EXCISE TAXES. HOWEVER

00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:56.881
PURSUANT TO SOME TRAILER BILL

00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:59.284
THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:00.018
SEVENTEEN IT'S ACTUALLY FINAL

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:02.687
DISTRIBUTORS TO REMIT THE TAXES

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:05.156
TO SEE TFA. SO THIS RESULTS IN

00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:07.425
KIND OF A MULTI STEP PROCESS

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:09.060
FOR HAVING THE TAXES- FLOW

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:11.363
THROUGH TO CD TFA. SO IF YOU

00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:12.464
LOOK AT THE FIGURE ON THAT

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.833
PAGE- IT'S HER HIGHLIGHTS THAT

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:17.535
PROCESS THIS IS THE EXAM SIMPLE

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:19.204
MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS. IN SOME

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.039
CASES IF IT'S A VERY IF IT'S

00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:22.540
COMPLEX MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:24.376
IT ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE MORE

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:25.710
STEPS BECAUSE IT MIGHT GO

00:27:25.777 --> 00:27:27.078
THROUGH MORE MANUFACTURERS. BUT

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:28.546
IN THIS CASE THE CULTIVATE

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:29.681
WOULD REMAIN THE TAXES TO THE

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:31.750
FIRST DISTRIBUTOR. THEN TO A

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.718
MANUFACTURER FOR MANUFACTURING

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:35.954
THEN TO THE LAST DISTRIBUTOR

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:37.756
AND THEN PRIOR TO GOING TO THE

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:39.858
RETAILER- THE PRICE GOING THE

00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:42.460
RETAILER TAX WOULD BE PERMITTED

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:44.863
TO SEE THE TFA. I ALSO JUST

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:45.764
WANT TO KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.664
LITTLE BIT MORE. EVEN ON THE

00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:48.333
RETAIL SIDE AND THE REASON FOR

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.135
THAT IS THAT. RETAILERS

00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:52.170
GENERALLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:54.039
THEIR TAX PAYMENTS I BEFORE

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:55.473
THEY MAKE A RETAIL SALE THEY

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.307
ACTUALLY TO MAKE IT WHEN THEY

00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:58.143
PURCHASE THE PRODUCT. FROM THE

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:00.845
WHOLESALER. SO BECAUSE OF THAT

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:01.946
THE PRODUCT THAT TAX ACTUALLY

00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:04.082
HAS TO BE BASICALLY WHOLESALE

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:05.984
TAX. EVEN THOUGH SERVE IN

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:07.752
STATUTES RETAIL TAX SO

00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:10.321
ESSENTIALLY CITY TFA IS CHARGED

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:12.057
WITH COMING UP WITH THE HOLES

00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:13.558
OF TAX EQUIVALENT. TO THAT

00:28:13.625 --> 00:28:15.160
RETAIL PRICE TAX AND THAT'S

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:16.795
CALLED THE MARK UP. SO THAT'S

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.229
KIND OF ANY OTHER MINISTRY TO

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:22.434
STOP THAT THE TFA. MUST PERFORM.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.538
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE.

00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:27.405
WE SUMMARIZE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:29.641
PROPOSALS THEIR TWO MAIN PIECES

00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:31.776
AS AS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER THE

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:33.044
FIRST IS CHANGING THE POINT OF

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:34.512
COLLECTION FOR CAP THE CANNABIS

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:36.948
TAXES SO THAT BUDGET TRAILER

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:39.184
LEGISLATION PROPOSES TO SHIFT

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.919
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OMITTING

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:44.722
THE CULTIVATION TAX. FROM SORRY

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:46.224
TO THE FROM THE FINAL

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:46.724
DISTRIBUTOR TO THE FIRST

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:49.694
DISTRIBUTOR. AND RESPONSIBILITY

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:50.695
FOR REMITTING THE RETAIL EXCISE

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:53.298
TAX FROM THE FINAL DISTRIBUTOR

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:55.400
TO THE RETAIL TO THE RETAILER.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:56.434
THE GOVERNOR INDICATES ALSO

00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:57.469
THAT HE'S CONSIDERING SOME

00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:58.870
OTHER TAX CHANGES TO

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:00.872
POTENTIALLY TO THE TAX SYSTEM

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:03.374
IN TAX RATES BUT WE HAVE IT-

00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:03.975
HEARD ANY DETAILS ON WHAT THAT

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:06.277
MIGHT BE. SO SECOND THE

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:07.545
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TO

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:08.847
CONSOLIDATE LICENSING FUNCTIONS

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:09.914
AS WE HEARD WITHIN A NEW

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:11.616
DEPARTMENT. SO AS I MENTIONED

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:12.617
BEFORE CURRENTLY THERE ARE

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:14.319
THREE LICENSING DEPARTMENTS AND

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:15.487
THOSE FUNCTIONS WOULD BE

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:17.522
CONSOLIDATED INTO A NEW ENTITY

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.124
KNOWN AS- THE DEPARTMENT CAMPUS

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.359
CONTROL. THE ADMINISTRATION

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.161
HASN'T PROVIDED ANY DETAILS YET

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:25.897
ON THIS PROPOSAL AND

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:26.431
ANTICIPATES PROVIDING THAT

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:29.667
SOMETIME IN THE SPRING. SO IF

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:31.469
YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:33.938
HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ISSUES

00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:35.273
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.808
FIRST WITH REGARD TO THE POINT

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.576
OF COLLECTION WE FIND THAT AT.

00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:40.945
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SHOULD

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:41.479
IMPROVE TAX ADMINISTRATION

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:43.815
COMPLIANCE THE MAIN REASON FOR

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:44.916
THAT IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:46.918
PROPOSAL WOULD. BASICALLY

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:49.487
IMPROVE THE NEXUS BETWEEN- THE

00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:50.989
TAX ACTIVITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:53.424
FOR OMITTING TAXES IT WOULD

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:54.092
REDUCE THAT FOR OF HANDS

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.326
BASICALLY THAT THOSE TAXES HAVE

00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:57.395
TO GO THROUGH. IT ALSO WOULD

00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:59.497
ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THAT

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:01.166
MARKET CALCULATION THAT I

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:02.200
MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. SO I

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:03.801
STATURE THE LEGISLATURE RETAINS

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:05.236
THE RETAIL EXCISING CULTIVATION

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.404
TAX WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:07.539
LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:09.474
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THAT

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:11.176
AREA. HOWEVER AS WE MENTIONED

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:12.877
IN OUR DECEMBER REPORT WHICH

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:14.579
HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A WE

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.281
ACTUALLY ALSO RECOMMEND SOME

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.315
ADDITIONAL CHANGES. TO THE

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:20.151
CALIFORNIA- TO CANNABIS TAXES

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:22.053
AS WELL AS THEIR RATES. SO

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:22.921
SECONDLY ON THE ISSUE OF

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:23.988
CONSOLIDATING LICENSING

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:25.790
FUNCTIONS WE THINK THE GENERAL

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:26.925
CONCEPT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE WE

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:29.127
THINK IT HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:30.428
IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:31.996
CANNABIS LICENSING ENFORCEMENT

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:33.998
ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE WE

00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:35.033
THINK IT COULD IMPROVE THE

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:36.701
ACCOUNTABILITY THE SYSTEM FOLKS

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.169
WILL KNOW THERE'S ONE ENTITY TO

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:40.271
GO GO TO FOR ALL THESE THESE

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.373
THESE ISSUES CURRENTLY WITH

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.408
THREE DIFFERENT APARTMENT. A

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:45.343
TRICKY FOR FOLKS TO KNOW KIND

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.477
OF. YOU TO GET THE ANSWERS

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:47.879
FROM. AND SOMETIMES THEY MIGHT

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:49.314
GET. ANSWERS THAT AREN'T

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.748
ENTIRELY CONSISTENT SO WE THINK

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:51.816
THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:54.252
ADVANTAGE TO HAVING ONE ENTITY-

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.120
HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT. A LOT OF

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:58.289
THEIR- DETAILS ARE GONNA BE

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.591
VERY IMPORTANT AND SO THE

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:00.792
LEGISLATURE'S REALLY GOING TO

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:02.427
WANT TO DRILL DOWN. AND MAKE

00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:03.194
SURE THAT THE WAY IT'S

00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:04.295
SPECIFICALLY GOING TO BE

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:05.997
IMPLEMENTED CONSISTENT WITH ITS

00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:07.765
PRIORITIES. SO ACCORDINGLY

00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:08.900
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:10.702
LEGISLATURE REQUESTS THE

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:12.837
ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE. I THESE

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:15.406
DETAILS AS SOON AS THEY CAN ON

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:17.609
HIM HOPEFULLY SOONER IN THE

00:31:17.675 --> 00:31:18.176
SPRING RATHER THAN LATER FOR

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:20.511
EXAMPLE- BECAUSE IT. CAN BE

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:21.379
VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:23.648
LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THIS OF

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:28.219
COMPLEX PUT. IT'S PER. PROCESS

00:31:28.286 --> 00:31:28.820

PROGRAM CERTAINLY- ALCOHOL AND

00:31:56.514 --> 00:31:59.384
TOBACCO TAXES- ARE AMONG THEM

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.585

SORTS POINTS OF. COMPARISON FOR

CANNABIS TAXES AND SO THERE ARE

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:07.125
SOME SURFACE SIMILARITIES AND

00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:08.726
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE I'M

00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:10.161

LOWERING EXCISING CULTIVATION

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:36.888
SIMILARLY AS YOU WELL KNOW THAT

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:39.490
IS. DISTINCT FROM THE LA OWES A

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:43.328
PROPOSED- CHANGES UNTIL IF YOU

DECEMBER WE DID TALK ABOUT CAN

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:56.040

SPECIFICALLY UNDER PROP SIXTY.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.712
PROP SIXTY FOUR AT OUR OFFICE

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.947
OKAY THE ATTACKS MAKES A

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:03.881
RECOMMENDATION TO ACHIEVE THREE

00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:06.284
PER. UNDER THE LIST MARKET I

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:07.585
WOULD USING YOUTH USE AND

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:09.287
RAISING SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:12.056
FUND THE PROGRAMS ENUMERATED IN

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:15.193
THE MEASURE. SO AS PART OF THAT

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:19.430
WORD FACE THE ANALYZED IT'S IF

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:21.165
HE'S BASICALLY WE ALL EYES OF

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:22.767
THE STRUCTURE. I'M ONE OF THE

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:25.536
THINGS WE DETERMINED IS. FELT

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:27.338
THAT THE CALL XIN TAXES A

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:28.506
RELATIVELY WEAK TAX IT DIDN'T

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.375
HAVE A LOT OF ADVANTAGES.

00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:33.344
BECAUSE BASICALLY YOU KNOW THE

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.046
OTHER TAXES COULD COULD COULD

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:36.781
HAVE ACHIEVED FAME GOALS I'M AT

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.649
THE MINISTRY OF A MORE COMPLEX

00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:40.418
I'M SO WE RAISED SOME CONCERNS

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.987
ABOUT THEIR RECOMMENDING IF YOU

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:44.021
KEEP RETAIL EFFECT ACTS GETTING

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:47.592
CULTIVATION TAX- WE ALSO HAVE-

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.694
POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR HIS AS

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:50.595
WELL BUT WHAT WE THINK. I'M

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:58.403
MORE CONSIDERATE. CARE IF. YOU

00:33:58.469 --> 00:33:59.504
THE CALL TAX TO KEEP THREE

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.972
TALKS I TAX AMERICAN. WE DO

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:01.639
HAVE SOME RAY THAT WE WERE. AND

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:02.407
BASICALLY. IN PRACTICE WOULD BE

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:03.374
REVENUE OR POTENTIALLY

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:05.276
SUBSTANTIAL TECH CUTS SO WE

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:08.112
THINK YOU COULD DO BASICALLY A

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.615
TAX CUT AND PROBABLY STILL

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.049
RAISE SUFFICIENT REVENUES IT

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:14.152
YOU HAVE TO SORT OF- STRUCTURE

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:15.553
THAT NET. SO THAT YOU DON'T DO

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.054
IT SO MUCH THAT YOU DON'T BUT

00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:18.055
YOU CAN'T REVENUES.

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:21.426
SUBSTANTIALLY BUT- WE DO HAVE A

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:23.594
THINK BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND 20%

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:25.396
IF YOU JUST KEEP THAT RETAIL

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:27.198
TAX. ON IT IF YOU WERE TO

00:34:27.265 --> 00:34:28.633
ACTUALLY GET RETAIN THAT

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.535
CULTIVATION TAX THE RICH WOULD

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.270
BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. SO I

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:32.904
DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.505
QUESTION BUT WE DID BUT THAT

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:35.373
THE TAX RATES AS PART OF THAT

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.407
WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:37.675
THEN AT THE NEXT AND WITH

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.710
RESPECT TO THE CONCERN POSITION

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:41.245
OF LICENSING FUNCTIONS INTO A

CONSUMER AFFAIRS BCC AND A

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:47.819
NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES A

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.420
TYPICALLY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:51.189
RETAIN ITS OVERSIGHT CAPACITY

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.790
ON THE SUNSET. THAT WOULD BE

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:54.125
REQUIRED ON A NUMBER OF

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:55.293

IMPORTANT BOTH ON THE POLICY

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:43.441

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.320
OF THE KIND OF TOPIC THAT OPENS

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:57.922
ITSELF TO REALLY ROBUST

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.690
OVERSIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S ONE

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:00.825
OF THE THINGS THAT- YOU KNOW

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:02.960
THE DETAILS COULD YOU. COULD BE

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:05.963
OUT THAT PROPERTY THAT. THE

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.732
PROCESS BUT WE THINK IT'S

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:08.866
CERTAINLY IS A CRITICAL

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:10.501
FUNCTION FOR LEGISLATURE

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:12.303
PERFORM. WELL HOW BOUT EVEN AT

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.238
THE SIMPLISTIC NATURE TO WHICH

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:17.408
IS. SIMILARLY WITHIN ANY OTHER

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:18.476
ENTITIES ON THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:22.513
CONSUMER AFFAIRS HAS THE LA-

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.916
GIVEN ANYTHING TO THAT. ON I'M

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:26.717
I'M NOT ENTIRELY IF ON SO I'M

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:27.418
ANSWERING YOUR- I THINK THAT

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:29.353
THE SUN. OF YOUR- OF A VERY.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.189
PROCESS FOR OVERSIGHT- AND NOT

00:36:32.256 --> 00:36:35.993
PROCESS- I THINK. IS A VERY-

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.430
WELL ESTABLISHED AND- AND GOOD

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:40.598
PROCESS FOR ENSURING OVERSIGHT

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:41.599
SO THAT CERTAINLY COULD BE A

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:43.100
MODEL FOR THAT COULD BE USED

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:44.101
WHETHER IT'S WITHIN BUSINESS

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:45.069
AND PROFESSIONS ARE ANOTHER

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:46.537
COMMITTEE. OF COURSE THAT'S UP

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.673
TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT- BUT I

00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:51.042
THINK THAT PROCESS THAT TYPE OF

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:52.843
PROCESS IS REALLY. VERY VERY

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:53.778
VALUABLE ONE BECAUSE THAT

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.713
SUBJECTS. THE HIGH THESE

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.115
ENTITIES TO I THINK VERY

00:36:58.182 --> 00:36:59.684
SIGNIFICANT REVIEW AND

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.652
OVERSIGHT AND THEY KIND OF HAVE

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:02.954
TO PERIODICALLY COME FORWARD

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.689
AND- AND REALLY EXPLAIN WHAT

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.490
THEY'RE DOING AND MAKES AND IF

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:07.158
THE LEGISLATURE GREAT

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:09.126
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT-

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:10.528
THAT IT STILL COMFORTABLE WITH.

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:11.696
THE PATH HAT THEY'RE GOING ON

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:13.397
SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT MODEL

00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:16.100
BUT OF COURSE IT COULD BE-

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:18.369
COULD BE SHIFTED IF THE FACT

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:19.904
THAT THESE ARE AS WELL. THANK

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:21.138
YOU AND I THINK THE IMPORTANCE

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:22.239
IS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE BROUGHT

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:23.774
STAKEHOLDER INPUT IN. AND

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:24.942
ACTUALLY PROVIDES THE

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.510
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR PUBLIC

00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:28.779
INPUT IN PRAGUE COLDER

00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:30.982
ENGAGEMENT. AND FINALLY SIMILE

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:32.516
IS IT YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT-

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:35.653
WITH THE RE ORDER OF- THE

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.355
DEPARTMENT THAT LEGISLATIVE

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.623
APPROVAL WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR

00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:40.524
THAT AS WELL. YEAH SO I THINK

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:43.828
UNDER THE- UNDER THAT WE

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:44.428
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS LIKELY

00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:45.763
TO. HE PROPOSES TRAILER BILL

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:46.797
LEGISLATION AND OF COURSE THAT

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:48.532
WOULD BE HEARD. AND TO BUDGET

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:50.234
PROCESS AND THE BUDGET

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:51.535
COMMITTEE AS WELL AS A FULL

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:53.337
LEGISLATURE. OR OTHER PROCESS

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:54.839
THAT CAN BE USED AS WELL FOR

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:56.107
EXAMPLE SUMMARY OR IS IN THE

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:57.041
PAST HAVE GONE THROUGH A

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.576
GOVERNOR'S WE ARE PROCESS.

00:37:58.643 --> 00:37:59.610
COURSE THAT WOULD ALSO GO

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.245
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE SO THE

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:02.446
LEGISLATURE HAS A REALLY

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:04.548
IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONSIDERING

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:06.183
THESE PROPOSALS AND DECIDING

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.184
WHETHER THEY'RE CUT WHETHER THE

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:08.386
LEGISLATURE'S COMFORTABLE WITH

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:09.620
THE PROPOSAL OR WANT TO MAKE

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:11.022
CHANGES. I'M WHATEVER IT

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.823
PROCESSES USED WE THINK THAT'S

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.225
REALLY CRITICAL AND THAT'S WHY

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:16.394
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE THAT THE

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.596
ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE DETAILS

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:22.433
SOONER RATHER THAN. LATER WE

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.202
THINK THAT'LL MORE TIME. I'M IN

00:38:25.269 --> 00:38:26.337
AN ARTS. YOU KNOW WHEN

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:27.104
PROPOSALS FOR COME. YOU KNOW

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:27.738
I'VE MAYOR OF. WHICH SOMETIMES

00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:28.806
THEY DO. I'M A CAN IT LEAVES

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.307
VERY LITTLE TIME FOR THE

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:31.409
LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS THOSE

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:34.078
PROPOSALS- BECAUSE THERE'S JUST

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:34.945
ESPECIALLY WITH THAT THE

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:35.880
DEADLINES THAT THE

00:38:35.946 --> 00:38:37.415
LEGISLATURE'S UNDER IT- IN

00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:38.849
PRACTICE IT IT. DOESN'T GIVE A

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:39.950
LOT OF TIME FOR CONSIDERATION

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:42.186
SO WE THINK THAT IF THAT

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:43.320
PROPOSALS COULD COME IN.

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.122
EARLIER THAN NOT THAT WOULD

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:46.590
THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.292
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:51.328
CONVERSATION. IT'S WILL FOLLOW

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.197
UP COME HAVE YOU CONSIDERED.

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:54.732
LOOKING AT HE- MOVING THE

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:55.800
RETAIL TAX TO DISTRIBUTION

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:58.736
INSTEAD. APPOINT A CELLS IS

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:01.672
PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:06.043
US SO- FOR THE DECEMBER REPORT

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.312
THAT- THAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.314
REFERRED TO WE EXAMINE WE

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:12.683
SERVE. THOUGHT ABOUT POTENTIAL

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.152
CHANGES TO- CANNABIS THE

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.854
STATE'S CAMPUS EXCISE TAXES IS

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:18.422
SORT OF A THREE STEP PROCESS

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:21.158
FIRST CHOOSING WHAT TYPE OF TAX

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:22.693
OR TAXES TO LET THE SECOND.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.395
CHOOSING HOW TO COLLECT THEM IN

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:26.597
THIRD DETERMINING THE RATE AND

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:29.600
SO- WE DID CONSIDER FOR EACH

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:32.103
TYPE OF TAX THAT WE LOOKED AT

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:34.105
IN THE REPORT WE CONSIDERED-

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:35.206
SEVERAL DIFFERENT POSSIBLE

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:38.275
POINTS OF COLLECTION INCLUDING-

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:40.845
THE FINAL DISTRIBUTION AND AS

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:43.881
WELL AS AS THE RETAILER- SO

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:46.183
ULTIMATELY WE FOR A POTENCY

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.219
BASED TAX WE THINK THAT EITHER

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:50.521
THE FINAL DISTRIBUTION OR-

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:52.356
RETAILER COULD BE A REASONABLE

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:54.792
POINT OF COLLECTION BUT FOR

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.227
PRICE BASED TAXES. ALSO KNOWN

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:57.895
AS AT VALOREM TAXES WHETHER

00:39:57.962 --> 00:39:59.764
THAT'S LIKE THE CURRENT RETAIL

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.266
EXCISE TAX WE HAVE OR SOME-

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:03.734
ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD BE AT

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:06.070
LAST DISTRIBUTION. IN THOSE

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:09.807
SCENARIOS- WE DID RECOMMEND-

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:10.908
COLLECTING THOSE AT THE RETAIL

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:14.278
LEVEL- AND THE REASON WAS SOME

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:16.447
OF THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE AT

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:17.047
TAX ADMINISTRATION FORCED AND

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:20.317

OPERATIONS. I GUESS ONE COULD

00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:09.873

ENFORCEMENT ON LISTEN MARKET IS

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:14.678
VERY LIGHT. WHAT IS OR WHERE

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:17.280
THOSE US COORDINATING WITH THE

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:18.548
LOCAL JURISDICTION BECOMES

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:21.051
IMPERATIVE- TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:22.352
WE ARE PARTNERING UP WITH THE

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.421
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ATTACK

00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:25.989
THE ILLEGAL MARKET AND THAT'S

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:27.724
WITH THE EXPERTISE IS BASED NOT

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:30.927
WITH YOUR AGENCY. A LOT OF

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:34.597
OPERATIONS. I'M NOT SURE I

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.833
UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION. TO

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.568
THOSE INVESTIGATIONS YES THE

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:42.372
EXPERTISE IS PRIMARILY IN THOSE.

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:43.940
LOCAL AGENCIES THAT HAVE THE

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:46.643
EXPERTISE IN ILLICIT IN OUR IN

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.812
OUR CONTACTS PERIOD WAY SO THAT

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:50.580
WAS REALLY EXPERTISE LIES

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.048
VERSES LYING WITH CANNABIS

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.917
CONTROL OR EVEN DOJ FOR THAT

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:56.820
MATTER. CORRECT I MEAN

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:58.488
OBVIOUSLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:00.890
YEARS THE STAFF AT SEE YOU OF

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:04.260
DEVELOPED. A LOT OF EXPERTISE

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:06.329
WHEN IT COMES TO- CANNABIS

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:08.598
ENFORCEMENT SO I WOULD SAY IT

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:11.167
IT IS ON BOTH SIDES BELOW THAT

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:12.769
X. IS THAT THAT'S MORE THE

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:14.537
LICENSING PART BEEN SAVING FOUR

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:16.673
PART. WITH THE AND I'M DONE

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.275
JUNE DOWN THE LIVE MARKET

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:21.411
SPECIFICALLY ON THAT. THAT

00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:22.746
THAT'S REALLY THE BIG A HUNDRED

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:24.581
POUND GORILLA IN THE ROOM IS

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:31.421
LISTEN MARKET. SO. IT IS

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:31.955
SOMEONE I SPENT TEN YEARS

00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:34.691
NARCOTICS. THE EXPERTISE LIES

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:37.227
THE LOCAL LEVEL IT IS NEVER. IN

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:38.862
THE STATE LEVEL OF ANY

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:42.565
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT EVER. SO I

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:44.801
GUESS DEFICIT IF WE'RE REALLY

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:45.368
GOING TO ATTACK THE LIST OF

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:47.370
MARKET. LOCALS HAVE TO PLAY

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:48.972
LEGAL PART OF IT BECAUSE THE

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:51.074
STATE CAN'T PLAY WHEN HE HAD TO

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:54.043
BE OUT BE ANY FOR DOJ. THAT WAS

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:54.644
LIMITED THEY RELIED ON LOCALS

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.279
HEAVILY. SO IT'S SO IT'S ALWAYS

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:57.614
BEEN THAT WAY WITH THESTATE

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.748
AND LIKE I SAID YOU CAN GO LOOK

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:00.083
AT THE EXPERTISE. TECHNICALS

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:02.352
INVESTIGATION WITH THE MARKET

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:02.952
WELL YOU'RE FOLLOWING SOMEONE

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.120
DOING SURVEILLANCE- MAKING

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:07.023
PURCHASES. YOU NEED THOSE FOLKS

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.892
DOING THIS OTHERWISE. THE

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:10.426
DENTURE MAKING THE LISTEN

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:14.864
MARKET IS INELIGIBLE. HI I JUST

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.099
WANNA MAKE ONE POINT A TO DO

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:17.934
THINK THAT- THROUGH SOME OF THE

00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:19.035
LISTENING SESSIONS THAT THE

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:20.603
ADMINISTRATION DID WITH LOCALS

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.672
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IT

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:24.140
OUT TO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:25.575
AGENCIES DO YOU SEE AS A

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:27.377
PARTNERSHIP IN A LOT OF WAYS

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.045
BECAUSE- THERE ARE THINGS THAT

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:32.315
ARE THAT THEY LACKED CLARITY ON

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:37.053
AND I THINK THE- SORT OF HEALTH.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.121
NEXT YOU KNOW MAYBE SOMEONE WHO

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.088
IS OPERATE IN THE GRAY AREA

OTHER THING BUT WE HAVE ABOUT

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.064

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:12.654
JUST LIKE TO SAY. A COUPLE

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:14.489
THINGS FIRST OF ALL I'M

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:15.223
THRILLED ABOUT THE

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.758
CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE IT'S A

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.326
WELCOME LOGICAL ADJUSTMENT THE

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:20.261
NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AND I THINK

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.097
IT'S GOING TO HELP THE

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:24.733
CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE. THE

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:26.434
MONSTER THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:29.537
TACKLE IS THE- THE COMPETITION

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:33.975
TO LEGAL MARKET. UNFORTUNATELY

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:36.111
WE LIKE NOR THEIR STATE HAVE A

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.846
BIG DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE

01:23:37.912 --> 01:23:39.881
BASICALLY FOR TWENTY YEARS WE

01:23:39.948 --> 01:23:41.783
HAD A MARGINAL MARKET AND WE

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:42.951
HAD A MARKET THAT ALLOWED

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:46.588
PEOPLE TO. SKATE A KIND OF A

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:49.023
CONSEQUENCE AND SO WHEN WE

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:51.025
ADOPTED THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OR

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:53.228
WHEN WE AND HAVE ATTEMPTED TO

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.295
ADOPT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK THE

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:56.998
ONLY WAY. YOU'RE ABLE TO

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:59.367
COMPETE IN THAT NEW SPACE. AS

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:04.105
IF YOU HAVE SOME STICK I KNOW

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:05.073
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANYBODY FEEL

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.075
GOOD IN HERE BUT IT'S FACT AND

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:08.543
THE END OF THE STICK THAT WE

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:11.146
HAVE IS NOT INCARCERATION IT'S

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:14.149
MONEY. AND WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:16.618
IS IN A FORCE AND ORGANIZED A

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:19.120
PARTNERING AS- THE CHAIR WAS

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:20.622
TALKING ABOUT USING LOCAL

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:23.525
RESOURCES. THEY'RE GOOD THEY

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.193
KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE BUT THE

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.995
PROBLEM IS TO. IS THE

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.663
ENFORCEMENT IS CIVIL VERSUS

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.465
CRIMINAL AND MOST LAW

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.034
ENFORCEMENT DON'T. AREN'T

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.170
COMFORTABLE IN THE CIVIL SPACE.

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:36.871
AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.706
FRUSTRATION AND IT WE NEED TO

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:41.009
FIGURE THIS OUT. BECAUSE IF WE

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:43.511
DON'T. IT'S NOT GOING TO

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:45.680
CHANGE. AND I DON'T THINK WE

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.382
CAN TO STAY IN A LEGAL MARKET

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:49.451
UNLESS WE'RE HAVING- BUST AND I

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:53.588

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:55.557
L. IT'S BEEN. VERY VERY FIRST

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:57.425
BUT THE COMPLY. IT'S VERY VERY

01:24:57.492 --> 01:25:01.830
DIFFICULT COMPLEX. NOT SO MUCH.

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.765
IN THE ILLICIT MARKET AND I CAN

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:05.667
TELL YOU THIS IS HOW BAD IT IS

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:08.203
FOLKS I MEAN I COME FROM A

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:10.305
DISTRICT THAT HAS. SOME PRETTY

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:12.507
RURAL CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE WHAT

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:14.175

AFRAID OF RUNNING THEIR

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:28.857
BUSINESS. AND IT'S A SHAME

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:31.759
ANOTHER- PART OF MY DISTRICT

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:34.329
WHICH IS A PRETTY RURAL AREA-

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:35.597
HAS ITS OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:39.434
VERY SMALL- LESS THAN THIRTY

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:41.636

GOVERNOR AND THIS LEGISLATURE

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.899

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:32.086
NOT AYING THAT IS NOT A

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:36.057
VALUABLE BUT INVESTMENT. BUT

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:36.524
NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:40.728

COULDN'T BE MORE INTO THIS

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:10.158
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:12.860
DO AND THIS EVEN IF IT'S ON

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:14.529
COMFORTABLE I'M NOT GOING AWAY.

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:15.663
AND IM HOPING THAT WE CAN

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.366
PENETRATE THE YEARS OF POWER.

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:21.169
BECAUSE I HAVE A WHISPER AND

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.437
I'M GONNA SCREAM AND MY

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.939
WHISPERS MUCH AS I CAN. UNTIL

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:26.774
WE ACTUALLY TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:29.577
BECAUSE GOOD PEOPLE. ARE

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:31.779
GETTING THEIR **** WHACKED. AND

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.047
THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST AND

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:34.983
IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT THIS. IS

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:36.451
THE TUITION THAT THE TRUST IS

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:45.560
BETRAYING THEM. BECAUSE WE ARE.

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:48.196
THIS IS A MILLION ECHOING. MR

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:52.000

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:02.510
UNDERSTAND THAT- FOR EXAMPLE IT

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:04.078
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WE MET HAVE

01:28:04.145 --> 01:28:05.146
REMOVED THEIR LIGHT UNLICENSED

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:07.281
LISTINGS BUT I JUST KEEP CAME

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.317
UPON AS AN ADVERTISEMENT ON

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:10.985
YELP THAT IS SELLING THE- GIFT

FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS SHOPS- IT

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:18.493
HOW DO WE TACKLE THIS IN IS

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:19.627
THERE ANY ENGAGEMENT IN

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.863
EFFORTS- FROM YOUR VANTAGE

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:23.131
POINT ON HOW I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:24.432
WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:26.300
BEFORE WITH RESPECT TO WHACK A

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:27.935
MOLE BUT- WE- TO. ADDRESS THESE

01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:29.303
ISSUES THAT WE CAN HELP GOOD

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:32.540
ACTORS AS WELL. YEAH WE GET A

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:34.275
LOT OF COMPLAINTS ON

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:36.844
ADVERTISEMENTS AND SO WE ARE

01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:38.880
OBVIOUSLY RESPONDED THOSE BUT

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:41.549
WE ALSO PROACTIVELY ARE GOING

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:44.852
INTO THE DIFFERENT- ILLEGAL ON

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:46.187
THE INTERNET I'M SORRY INTERNET

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:48.256
PLATFORMS TO CHECK TO SEE OF

01:28:48.322 --> 01:28:50.158
THEIR COMPLIANCE IF. OF PEOPLE

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:51.559
ARE DISPLAYING THEIR LICENSE

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:52.694
NUMBER THEN WE'RE CHECKING IT

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.095
WITH OUR LICENSE SEARCH TO MAKE

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.030
SURE IT MATCHES UP IN SOME

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:58.966
CASES IT FOR SEEN THINGS. THAT

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:00.435
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S A LEGAL

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:02.804
BUSINESS WE WILL REPORT THAT TO

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:05.640
THE INTERNET PLATFORM AND WE DO

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:08.209
EXPECT THEM TO- TO TAKE THAT

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:10.311
DOWN OR PROVIDE US MORE

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:13.214
INFORMATION OF WHY THEY THINK

01:29:13.281 --> 01:29:13.815
IT'S LEGAL. AND WORST THIS A

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.917
LITTLE BIT MORE SUCCESS BY

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.719
ENGAGING THE INTERNET PLATFORM

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:19.253
WE'RE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.022
SETTING UP ADDITIONAL TOOLS FOR

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:22.690
THESE INTERNET PLATFORMS TO

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:24.125
AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT TO OUR

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.761
LICENSE SEARCH THROUGH AN API-

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:31.165
SO WE CAN PROVIDE THEM. IT'S A

01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:32.567
LITTLE BIT EASIER IF THEY CAN

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:33.768
AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT INSTEAD

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:36.304
OF GOING LINE BY LINE- LOOKING

01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:37.138
AT OUR LICENSE SEARCH TRYING TO

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:39.574
FIGURE THAT OUT SO I THINK-

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.109
WE'RE STARTING THAT PROCESS NOW

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.977
AND IF WE CAN'T GET COMPLIANCE

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.579
THEN. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:46.514
OTHER TOOLS TO RAMP UP THE

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:48.750
ENFORCEMENT AND- PERHAPS LOOK

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:53.287
AT SOME FINES OR PENALTIES. IT

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:54.355
IN THE KNEE JERKS WORKING THAT

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.791
PLAN YELP A THEY BEEN. TO THE

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.126
ISSUES THAT WHEN YOU I'VE

01:29:58.192 --> 01:29:59.861
BROUGHT ITTO THEIR ATTENTION.

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:02.296
I BECAUSE MOST OF THESE ARE

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:04.265
PENDING INVESTIGATIONS I CAN'T

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:06.901
TALK ABOUT. SPECIFIC INTERNET

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:10.071
PLATFORMS. BUT WE ARE ENGAGING

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:12.039
WITH THE INTERNET PLATFORMS

01:30:12.106 --> 01:30:13.741
SURE AND PERHAPS MAYBE A

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.676
DIFFERENT QUESTION- ARE THERE

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:18.312
ANY OPPORTUNITIES OR MECHANISMS

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.081
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSIST

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:22.283
YOU WITH A TO ENCOURAGE AND GET

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.252
A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY WITH

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:26.921
RESPECT INTERNET PLATFORMS. I

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:29.290
THINK- I THINK WE'RE ALREADY

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:30.958
FINDING OUT JUST WORKING WITH

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.660
THEM ON FIDING OUT THERE

01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:33.828
CERTAIN INFORMATION IN OUR

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:35.863
LICENSE SEARCH THAT WOULD BE

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.032
HELPFUL TO HIM FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:39.433
DON'T REQUIRE THAT PEOPLE PUT

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.902
ON THEIR LICENSE APPLICATION A

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:42.970
DBA AND MOST PEOPLE WHEN

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:43.905
THEY'RE ADVERTISING THEY'RE NOT

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:45.673
USING THEIR LEGAL BUSINESS NAME

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.508
THEY'RE USING A DBA. SO WE'RE

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:49.043
MAKING CHANGES TO MAKE THAT A

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:50.711
REQUIREMENT SO THAT CAN HELP

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:52.680
THEM SO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.248
WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT I

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:56.017
THINK ONCE THEY HAVE THE TOOLS

01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:58.586
AND- I THINK THERE MAY BE

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:00.922
THINGS THAT WE- WOULD BE IT

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:02.723
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US DOWN THE

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:05.259
ROAD I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:06.561
SPECIFIC. RIGHT NOW BUT- I

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:07.762
WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.264
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SOMETHING

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:12.133
FORWARD WHEN WE COME ACROSS IT.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.734
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY WE ALSO

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:15.002
DO A LOT OF EVERY WE DO THE

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:16.170
SAME THING WITH THE BILLBOARD

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.605
COMPANIES AS WELL WE GET A LOT

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:19.207
OF COMPLAINTS ON BILLBOARDS

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:20.975
THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. SO

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:21.843
NOT ONLY DO WE WORK WITH THE

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:24.111
LICENSEE WERE ALSO WORKING WITH

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:25.847
THE BILL FOR COMPANIES THAT IS

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.315
PUTTING UP THOSE BILLBOARDS TO

01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:29.584
GET THEM TO REMOVE IT SO IT'S

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:30.818
ON THE SAME FRONT LIKE THE

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:32.253
INTERNET PLATFORMS AS WELL.

SPECIFICALLY AND THEN FINALLY-

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:47.301
WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:49.170
CONSOLIDATION THEM WITH THE

MIGHT. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:55.543
CURRENTLY ON THIS PANEL- HERE

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:57.812
TODAY. HOW DO YOU FOR C. THAN

THE PROGRAM'S THEN GO. WELL I

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.389
MEAN I A I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:09.957
HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.225
MEAN I THINK I GAVE SORT OF THE

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:12.793
OVER ARCHING GOALS OF WHAT

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:13.995
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.529
SORT OF A- SIMPLER MORE

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:18.099
EFFECTIVE SYSTEM AND- AT ONE

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:18.900
PLACE WHICH I THINK IS

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:20.301
SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD. FROM

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:23.104
INDUSTRY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:24.705
YOU KNOW EVEN THE LEGISLATURE I

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:25.940
THINK IN SOME WAY THOUGHT ONE

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:28.142
PLACE WOULD MAKE SENSE- THESE

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:29.944
WORKING GROUPS ARE WORKING

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:31.979
DILIGENTLY TO FIGURE OUT. YOU

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:34.715
KNOW WHAT MAKES SENSE- AND HOW

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:36.250
TO IMPLEMENT THIS ANY SORT OF

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:38.152
REORGANIZATION OR CONSOLIDATION

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:39.320
IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:40.922
EFFORT. JUST IF WE WERE GONNA

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.723
TAKE IT IS AND TRY TO PUT IT

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:45.192
INTO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT SO-

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:46.794
YOU KNOW I THINK THOSE THOSE

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.462
DETAILS WERE REALLY STILL

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:49.897
WORKING OUT AND WE LOOK FORWARD

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:51.032
TO SHARING THOSE WITH YOU IN

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:53.267
THE SPRING. BUT THE IDEA HERE

01:32:53.334 --> 01:32:56.504
IS TO BUILD ON THE WORK THAT'S

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:57.638
BEEN DONE BY THESE PROGRAMS

01:32:57.705 --> 01:32:59.173
BECAUSE I THINK AS YOU ALL KNOW

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.341
THAT THEIR WORK SHOULD BE

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.776
APPLAUDED THEY PUT A TREMENDOUS

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:04.078
AMOUNT OF EFFORT IN THE LAST

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.746
FEW YEARS STANDING UP- OF. THIS

01:33:05.813 --> 01:33:07.381
MY FROM THANK AND I THINK

WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION

WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER

01:34:58.059 --> 01:35:00.127

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:01.495
WHEN THE SUN SETS COME UP FOR

WE HAVE A CONFLICT BETWEEN STE

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:09.129
HUNDRED BANKS CREDIT UNIONS IN

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:10.397
THE COUNTRY THAT ARE WORKING

PENDING BUT FROM OUR- MEMBERS

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:54.241
PERSPECTIVE IT'S INADEQUATE

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:56.343
IT'S STATIC REPORTS THAT DON'T

01:46:56.409 --> 01:46:57.210

THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION

01:47:11.091 --> 01:47:12.392
BECAUSE OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:13.760
ARE FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT MIGHT

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:15.929
NOT HAVE ONE BUILDING PERMIT.

FISH AND SEA AND AGAIN THAT

02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.214
GREATER PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:30.182
LOCAL LEVEL. BUT THAT'S ALSO

02:01:30.249 --> 02:01:31.584
INCLUDING FOLKS FROM FISH AND

02:01:31.651 --> 02:01:34.520
WILDLIFE AND THE WATER BOARD

02:01:34.587 --> 02:01:37.456
AND OTHER AREAS- THAT REALLY I

02:01:37.523 --> 02:01:39.191
THINK CAN POTENTIALLY DELAY THE

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:41.627
PROCESS INTO THAT CONVERSATION

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:43.029
HAVING POTENTIALLY LIAISONS

02:01:43.095 --> 02:01:45.631
WITH THAT TO. THAT'S WHY WE

02:01:45.698 --> 02:01:46.298
WANNA BE INCLUDED IN THIS.

02:01:46.365 --> 02:01:48.067
BECAUSE FROM THE INVITE. A

02:01:48.134 --> 02:01:49.935
REVIEW PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE A

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:51.137
LOT OF EXPERTISE AND FRANKLY

02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:53.139
WERE A LOT OF THE DELAY AT THE

02:01:53.205 --> 02:01:55.074
LOCAL LEVEL SO WE NEED TO BE-

EVERYTHING THAT THEY CARE SAID-

02:02:06.686 --> 02:02:08.454
I THINK WHEN YOU BRING A LOT OF

02:02:08.521 --> 02:02:10.222
THESE- WHEN YOU BRING THESE

02:02:10.289 --> 02:02:11.557
ENTITIES TOGETHER AND

02:02:11.624 --> 02:02:12.491
SYNTHESIZE ROLES AND

02:02:12.558 --> 02:02:14.226
RESPONSIBILITIES ALL IT ONLY

02:02:14.293 --> 02:02:16.495

FROM A TO B. TO ACCOMPLISH

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:31.077
THEIR TASK I MEAN. IT'S SO THEY

CAN ONLY MAKE THINGS EASIER AND

02:02:33.212 --> 02:02:35.681
LET FOR I THINK WHAT MAKES IT

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:38.284
EASIER IF WE HAVE THIS. THE

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:38.818

SUPPORT THE REFORMS OUTLINED IN

02:05:36.161 --> 02:05:38.330
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- WE ARE

02:05:38.397 --> 02:05:39.265
A STRONG PROPONENT OF

02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:41.934
CONSOLIDATION. SPECIFIC AND I

02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:45.371
THINK IN LARGE PART THAT IS DUE

02:05:45.437 --> 02:05:46.005
TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN A

02:05:46.071 --> 02:05:46.906
LOT OF COME ABOUT ENFORCEMENT

02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:49.308
TODAY WE HAVE LONG SUPPORTED A

02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:51.076
CENTRALIZED ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM

02:05:51.143 --> 02:05:52.912
A LOT OF THE EARNS WERE RAISED

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:55.547
BY BY- THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:56.849
MEMBERS TALKED ABOUT THE

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:59.585
DISTINCTION BETWEEN. LICENSED

02:05:59.652 --> 02:06:00.019
AND LICENSE LICENSED

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:02.988
ENFORCEMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THE

02:06:03.055 --> 02:06:05.858
LICENSEES HAVE- SUBJECT TO VERY

02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:08.027
ROBUST ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:10.029
COMPLIANCE BUT THERE IS A VERY

02:06:10.095 --> 02:06:12.131
VERY THRIVING LIST GET

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:13.632
CONTINUOUS I THINK THE FACT.

02:06:13.699 --> 02:06:15.434
THE BY CATION ENFORCEMENT IS

02:06:15.501 --> 02:06:19.405
REALLY PART OF THAT PROBLEM SO

02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:25.010
WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT AS PART OF

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:28.247
CONSENT SHRIMP TESTED REAL

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:33.452
FOCUSED IN CENTRAL FORCE. XIN

02:06:33.519 --> 02:06:34.186
PROPOSAL THE OTHER THING I

02:06:34.253 --> 02:06:34.753
THINK THAT'S REALLY IN. IS A

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:38.991
THE BY. OF LICENSES WE THINKTHAT THROUGH CONSOLIDATION- WE

02:06:39.058 --> 02:06:40.793
WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO REDUCE

02:06:40.859 --> 02:06:41.860
COSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE

02:06:41.927 --> 02:06:43.595
BARRIERS TO ENTRY IT'S VERY

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:45.431
VERY COSTLY TO GO THROUGH THAT

02:06:45.497 --> 02:06:46.632
BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:48.334
PROCESS. APPLY FOR MULTIPLE

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:52.304
LICENSES SO WE LIKE TO SEE- A

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:52.871
LITTLE BIT MORE EMPHASIS ON

02:06:52.938 --> 02:06:54.907
SHOULD USE MORE BY FOR. LESS BY

02:06:54.974 --> 02:06:58.644
CATION- FOCUSING ON. SAYS CAN

02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:01.313
PROCESS CAN YOU MANY FACTURE ON

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:02.815
THE C. PROMISES WERE HOPING AND

02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:05.884

SIMPLIFICATION. THE AND WE

02:07:13.726 --> 02:07:16.295
THINK THAT WILL USE YOURS TO

02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:24.670
ENTRY. CURVE. I THINK A PART OF

02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:26.905
OUR ILLICIT MARKET PROBLEM IS

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:28.407
THAT WE NEED TO BRING IMMEDIATE

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:40.919
RELIEF AND REDUCE THOSE TAXES

02:07:40.986 --> 02:07:42.187
THE IMPOSITION IN PARTICULAR

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:43.756
FOR WEIGHT BASS CULTIVATION TAX

02:07:43.822 --> 02:07:45.124
REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:46.225
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR

02:07:46.291 --> 02:07:47.926
CANNABIS IN THE SAYS. AND A

02:07:47.993 --> 02:07:50.262
MAJOR MAJOR BARRIER TO ENTRY A

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:51.697
COUPLE POINTS I JUST TO MAKE AS
