SENATOR STERN MOVES A CALL NOW MEMBERS WERE MOVING ON TO FALL ITEM TWENTY FOUR SENATOR ALAN ARE YOU PREPARED THEM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE. SENATE BILL SIX SIXTY FOUR BY SENATOR ALAN AN ACT RELATING TO HOSPICE. THROUGHOUT CALLING FOR GEORGE YES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- THIS BILL IMPOSES A TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON NEW HOSPICE LICENSURE THAT WOULD EXPIRE A YEAR AFTER THE COMPLETION OF A STATE AUDIT. TO IDENTIFY DEFICIENCIES AND RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HOSPICE LICENSURE AND OVERSIGHT PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE OSPICE MOVEMENT AND ITS INTEGRATION INTO WESTERN MEDICINE IS AN UPLIFTING STORY ABOUT COMPASSION. AND THE BEST INSTINCTS OF HUMANITY EMBRACING THE MISSION OF PROVIDING COMFORT AND SOLACE. TO THOSE AMONG US WHO ARE DYING. BUT THERE'S BEEN A- SERIES OF MEDIA REPORTS AND GOVERNMENT SURVEYS THAT SUGGEST A LACK OF OVERSIGHT HAS LED TO AN UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESS. A GROUP OF BUSINESSES ENTERING THE FIELD I FOCUS MORE ON PROFIT AND PAIN MANAGEMENT. IN CALIFORNIA SUCH PROBLEMS APPEAR Q. FOUR PROFIT HOSPICE LICENSORS IN OUR STATE HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS ESPECIALLY THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY WHICH WHETHER EXPONENTIALLY MORE HOSPICE PROVIDERS PER CAPITA. THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES I MEAN JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE SEVERAL CITIES IN LA COUNTY HAVE MORE. HOSPICES THEN- THE ENTIRE STATE OF FLORIDA OR NEW YORK. AN EXPOSE IN THE LA TIMES IS THE END OF THE YEAR LAST YEAR SUGGESTED THIS BOOM. HAS QUOTE SPAWNED A COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF ILLEGAL PRACTICES IN A TWENTY NINETEEN INVESTIGATION AT SACRAMENTO BEE FOUND CALIFORNIA'S HOSPICES THEM TO BE QUOTE. MARRED BY LAX OVERSIGHT AND INABILITY OF REGULATORS TO TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION. AGAINST HOSPICES THAT MAY HAVE VIOLATED RULES AND JEOPARDIZE THE HEALTH OF PATIENTS. SO I HAVE SUBMITTED AN AUDIT REQUESTED PROPOSES AN EXAMINATION OF THESE ALLEGATIONS IN AN EXPLORATION. OF PATHWAYS FOR POSSIBLE REFORM OF THE HOSPICE LICENSURE AND OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK. VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH- THE MEMBERSHIP AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO HAD TO PURSUE A COMPREHENSIVE MEANINGFUL REQUESTED THE STATE AUDITOR WILL ALSO. PRESSING THE PAUSE BUTTON ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE A PROFIT MOTIVE THAT AT LEAST IN SOME REGIONS OF OUR STATE. IS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPACING PATIENT DEMAND. AND WITH THAT I ASK THAT YOU HELP ME IN THIS EFFORT AND- TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. I THINK YOU DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BORDERS. HIS PRESENT- MAY I POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. GENERAL YOU ACCEPT QUESTIONS YES SIR GOOD CHEER THANK YOU- WAS THERE A- REQUESTED J. LOCK. TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT ON THIS ISSUE YES WE'VE JUST SUBMITTED A REQUEST. WOULD IT BE MORE HELPFUL TO- PUSH THIS LEGISLATION BACK PENDING THE FINDINGS OF THAT AUDITING CURRENT. WELL- SO WE'VE BETTER EFFECTIVELY- THE IDEA IS THAT WE WANT TO PUT A PAUSE BUTTON NOW BECAUSE THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE HOSPICES AS I SAY WE'VE GOT SO MANY MORE HOSPICES IN ANY OTHER STATE I MEAN JUST IT IT IT BLOWS THE NUMBERS BELOW EVERY OTHER STATE OUT OF THE WATER- SO THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO THEY DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T APPEAR THERE WOULD BE ANY SIGNIFICANT. IMPACT ON ON- AND- PATIENT ACCESS- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU READ THE REPORTS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY DID DATE THE CURRENT SITUATION MERITS PAUSING- NEW LICENSORS UNTIL WE HAVE BETTER INFORMATION AND BETTER UNDERSANDING FROM THE AUDITOR SO I HEAR YOU I GUESS I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THE OTHER I'LL BRING YOU A COPY OF THE LA TIMES ARTICLE AND- THEY DID A PRETTY STINGING EXPOSE THAT HAS LED ME TO THE PLACE WHERE I BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT MEASURE TO TAKE NOW- BEFORE- WE DO GET THE DATA FROM THE AUDITOR OBVIOUSLY THE AUDITOR'S. REPORT WELL. WELL WELL THEN STEER WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION BY CENTER BORDERS. K. NINE SENATOR GRAHAM. INTERMENT FIGURE MARKS ON THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF. SB SIX SIXTY FOUR- AS AS SOMEBODY WHO SPENT A LARGE PART OF MY CAREER WORKING AND STUDYING IN THE IN THE HOSPICE BASE IT IS A FANTASTIC. ORGANIZATION I SAY WITH PRIDE THAT MY MOM WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SPANISH SPEAKING VOLUNTEERS- IN IN HOSPICE- WAY BACK. IN THE EARLY DAYS AND SHE LOST A FRIEND IN A AND THAT WAS HER DEDICATION TO GO IN. AND WORK WITH LATINO COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY WHO OFTENTIMES IN HAVE ACCESS- BUT WHAT WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN SINCE THE ADVENT OF HOSPICES THE PROLIFERATION. OF FOR PROFIT HOSPICES COMING IN WHEN HOSPICE FIRST STARTED IT WAS JUST FREE FOR EVERYBODY BASED ON ON ON DONATIONS BUT AFTER THE AFTER WEEK BECAUSE- AS A SOCIETY DECIDED IT WAS A REIMBURSABLE- A SERVICE. AND THEN HAD A PER DIEM RATE BOTH WITH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AL AND THEN MOST PRIVATE INSURANCES WE SAW A- HUGE BOOM AND GROWTH IN HOSPICE YOU HAD TO SET AN INDUSTRY BUT AN INDUSTRY. SO WHAT STARTED OUT AS YOUR LOCAL NONPROFIT ATTACHED TO YOUR HOSPITAL WHO WAS DOING THIS FANTASTIC WORK AND DOING A REALLY PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES AT THE END OF LIFE PEOPLE WOULD DESCRIBE. US AS WORKERS AS ANGELS AND IT BECAME- SOME OF THESE- AND FOR PROFIT HOUSES THAT COME IN AND IS FLOOD THE MARKET WITH THEIR OWN- MARKETING THEY HAVE- MOST MOST OF THE TRADITIONAL HOUSES ARE MORE NON PROFIT- BASED AND THESE CAME IN WITH A- BIG BANKROLLS FOR. MARKETING AND WENT OUT VERY VIGOROUSLY INTO PATIENTS HOMES INTO FACILITIES TO. GET AS MANY CLIENTS AS THEY COULD WHICH THEN AT THE SAME TIME HURTS THE MORE TRADITIONAL HOSPICE HAS BEEN OUT IN THE COMMUNITY DOING THIS WORK FOR EVER. AND SO I WOULD RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS THAT TO PUT A PAUSE ON ALL THESE NEW ONES JUST POPPING UP EVERYWHERE- IT IT IT IT I FEEL LIKE IT IT DIMINISHES CARE AND CAN EVEN THEN DIMINISH. I THINK PEOPLE'S. PERCEPTION OF A HOSPICE IN AND THAT REPUTATION. AS IT HAS COME INTO THIS THE SPACE OF JUST SOMETIMES FEELING LIKE A TRYING TO GET THAT REIMBURSEMENT AND MAYBE THE WHOLE PLETHORA OF CARE AND AFTER CARE AND BEREAVEMENT SUPPORT. AND THE VOLUNTEER BASE THAT IS A HUGE PART OF THE HOSPICE I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO DEVELOP. A SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN I VOTE ON SB SIX SIXTY FOUR. AND THEN I'M SURE AFTER THE HOUSE REPORT WILL HAVE EVEN MORE CHANGES BUT TO PUT A PAUSE. ON NEW ONES COMING IN RIGHT NOW I THINK. IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND I WOULD FOR YOUR I. VOTE ON ESPYS. SIXTY FOUR. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING SOONER AND SOONER ALL OF WHICH ARE CLOSE WELL THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THEM MY COLLEAGUE THANK YOU SENATOR FROM STOCKTON FOR THE FOR THAT- I THINK YOU MADE BILL I WOULD SAY TO MY FRIEND FROM FRESNO. ON THE CENTER FOR JUST YOU KNOW I I'M JUST TO KIND OF FOLLOW UP A LITTLE MORE ON YOUR ON YOUR QUESTION AND I THINK WE ARE CERTAINLY IF IT'S A VISIT INTERESSE WORKED WE'RE OPEN TO MORE TARGETED MORATORIUM PERHAPS ON REGIONAL GROUNDS IT'S ACTUALLY THE CASE. THAT THE REAL PROBLEMS IN THIS SPACE ARE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO IF THERE'S SOME WAY THAT WE CAN CRAFT- THE MORATORIUM IN A WAY THAT WOULD WOULD REALLY FOCUS ON THE AREAS OF THE CITY WE HAVE MOST CONCERNED- THE OLD REALLY THE YOU KNOW THE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US THAT THAT THERE NOT BE ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL THAT MIGHT. IMPINGE UPONACCESS TO THE HOT TO GOOD QUALITY HOSPICE CARE AND WORK MORE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATES I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU AND WITH OTHER MEMBERS TO- TOOK TO CRAFT TO CRAFT THIS IN A WAY THAT WILL BE REALLY THOUGHTFUL CAREFUL- BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THERE THERE REALLY IS. SERIOUS FRAUD TARGETING OLDER AMERICANS AS A MENTION THE LA TIMES IS DONE EXTENSIVE JOURNALISM ON THIS TOPIC I THINK AND IT MERITS THIS THIS PAUSE BUTTON TO BE PRESSED UNTIL WE HAVE MORE DATA FROM THE AUDITOR AND WITHOUT.

SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY TWO BY SENATOR PAN AN ACT RELATING TO CRIMES IN DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE UP TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SENATOR BROWN THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATORS I RISE TO PRESENT SP FOUR SEVEN FORTY TWO BILL THAT BALANCES OUR RIGHT TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE PRIVACY AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH. FOR OVER A YEAR WE'VE WORKED TO SAVE AS MANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE DURING COVERT NINETEEN FACTOR CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW OF ALMOST THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION CASES. OF IT AND OVER SIXTY THOUSAND KNOWN DEATHS. FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF DECADES OF RESEARCH AND SCIENCE AROUND IMMUNOLOGY WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING THIS PANDEMIC TO A CLOSE. AND WE'RE FINALLY STARTING TO SAFELY REOPEN OUR COMMUNITIES HOWEVER THAT OPPORTUNITY MAY BE LOST IF WE DON'T GET ENOUGH PEOPLE VACCINATED. AND WHILE FEDERAL STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING BETTER EACH DAY DISTRIBUTING THESE COVER VACCINES AND EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE VACCINE ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS. THAT WE'RE ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH IN THIS VERY CHAMBER ARE ESCALATING THEIR TACTICS TO DISRUPT AND PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GETTING THE VACCINE. AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB SEVEN FORTY TWO TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE FREE SPEECH. AND BE SURE THAT PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE THE TOOLS TO ENSURE PATIENTS IN FRONT LINE WORKERS AT VACCINE CLINICS ARE SAFE FROM INTIMIDATION HARASSMENT. AND PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTIONS INCLUDING THE PRIVACY. MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE SHUTDOWN OF THE VACCINE CLINIC IN JANUARY AT DODGER STADIUM WHERE A MOB OF ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS STOP THE CLINIC FROM OPERATING JEOPARDIZING THE SAFETY PATIENTS PHONE LINE WORKERS. BUT THESE EXTREMISTS ARE CONDUCTING SIMILAR OPERATIONS ALL OVER THE STATE OFTEN TRYING TO BLEND IN AS FRONT LINE WORKERS. AND DISRUPTING OPERATIONS EVEN RESORTING TO TACTICS LIKE TARGETING FARM WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES THAT MOST. ARE MOST HEAVILY IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN AND NEED THE VACCINE THE MOST. OFTEN DURING THESE DRILLS THE ANTI VACCINE EXTREMISTS ARE RECORDING HARASSMENT. TO PUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND OUT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING THE VACCINE AS WELL AS VIOLATING THE PRIVACY OF THE PATIENTS AS WELL. CONDITIONALLY WHILE WE'RE DISTRIBUTING VACCINES AND ADDITIONAL HEALTHCARE SPACES LIKE HOSPITALS DOCTORS OFFICES AND PHARMACIES WERE ALSO USING NONTRADITIONAL LOCATIONS LIKE STADIUMS SCHOOL CAMPUSES PARKING LOTS. AND OTHER PLACES WE'RE CREATING NEW LOGISTICAL SITUATIONS THAT MY BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS IN FACT JUST LAST WEEK A WOMAN PLOWED THROUGH A TENT IN THE CAR. IN OUR EFFORT TO DISRUPT VACCINE DISTRIBUTION NARROWLY MISSING HEALTHCARE WORKERS NATIONAL GUARDSMEN WHO WERE THERE TO GIVE THE VACCINE. WE NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT WE STAND WITH PATIENCE AND FRONTLINE WORKERS AS THEY TRY TO BRING AN END TO THE PANDEMIC. FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND OFFICIALS PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY. DOING THEIR JOB BUT IT SHOULD NOT EXTEND TO FEAR OF HARASSMENT ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE IN THE GUISE OF PROTEST. OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL ARGUE THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY FREE SPEECH BUT THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE. WE CAN CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FREE SPEECH PROTECTED FOR PRIVACY AND ACCESS TO VACCINES THERE'S AN URGENCY CLAUSE SO THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS CAN. PROTECT VACCINATION CLINICS IMMEDIATELY. I APPRECIATE THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED SO FAR RESPECT THE OSCAR NIGHT. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OF THE VERY ON THIS ITEM SENATOR WARNER. I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN FORTY TWO AND I WANT TO REALLY DEEPLY THANK THE SENATOR FROM- SACRAMENTO FOR HIS ONGOING AND TENACIOUS- EFFORTS TO- TAKE A REALLY A SCIENCE BASED APPROACH AROUND VACCINES AND UNDERSTAND THE VACCINES ARE SO BENEFICIAL. FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY AND HE'S DONE SO- PARTICULARLY- DESPITE PERSONAL ATTACKS AND EVEN PHYSICAL ASSAULTS OF THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL WE KNOW THAT VACCINES ARE OUR PATH OUT OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND WE'RE SEEING. AROUND THE WORLD WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE VACCINE PEOPLE ARE DYING AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE VACCINE HERE IN THE US WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO HAVE THAT ACCESS- AND YET WE SEE CONCERTED EFFORTS TO TRY TO DISSUADE PEOPLE FROM TAKING THE VACCINE. AND WE'RE SEEING HIGHER CODE RATES IN THOSE AREAS PEOPLE STILL DYING- AND EVEN HERE AS WE SAW IN LOS ANGELES PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCT PEOPLE. FROM RECEIVING THE VACCINE VACCINE IS THIS IS US IS SO CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND AMERICA- AND WE WILL HAVE FUTURE PANDEMICS- AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE PROTECTING ACCESS TO VACCINATION. THANK YOU CENTER GORGEOUS- I THINK. WHEN YOU HAVE PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTION AND INTIMIDATION THAT CANNOT BE TOLERATED- FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS OBVIOUSLY MOST OBVIOUS IS YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS- TO GET VACCINATED BY MYSELF WITH WAS VACCINATED. I THINK MOST EVERYBODY IN HERE PROBABLY HAS AT THIS POINT. HAS AS WELL MY CONCERN HERE HOWEVER IS. THE TICKETS. IT CONTAINS. WE'RE GONNA TAKE A RECESS MEMBERS. YOU TAKE A RECESS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THE. I'M NOT CERTAIN I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE EVERYTHING WAS EXCEPT FOR THE- I WAS MAKING SOME COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR THAT. PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTION INTIMIDATION CAN NEVER BE TOLERATED AND ESPECIALLY IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS. MY CONCERN IS ON- PICKETING. PICKETING- A LOT OF US WITHIN HER PRECIADO PICKETING IS PART OF OUR FIRST AMENDMENT- PACKAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES AND I KNOW THERE'S TIME. PLACE AND MANNER RESTRICTIONS OFTEN RESERVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOUR WHAT IS APPROPRIATE. BUT PICKETING IS NOT INTIMIDATION. IN PICKETING IS NOT- PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCTIVE IF IT'S DONE APPROPRIATELY SO I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN IS I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS EXCEPT THAT PICKETING COMPONENT I THINK MIGHT CREATE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT MAY BE BEST LEFT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHETHER INDIVIDUALS GET A PERMIT. TO HAVE AN EVENT IN FRONT OF A FACILITY BUT I SUPPORT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL BUT THAT JUST GIVES ME A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PAUSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

OF THE TIME TO BE SERVED THE CHOICE. OF THE APPROPRIATE TERM WHICH RESTS WITH THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT EXISTING LAW SUNSETS IN JANUARY FOR FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY.

SEN REMOVES THE CALL NUMBER FOR ME TO FILE ITEM SIXTY THREE SENATOR BRADFORD MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SEVEN TEN BY SENATOR BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO CRIMINAL PROCEDURE SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF THIS IS TRUE FOR MEASURE WHICH WILL ADDRESS THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST EXISTS BETWEEN PROSECUTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED MISCONDUCT THIS BILL REQUIRED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS RECEIVED A MONETARY BENEFIT FROM ASSOCIATION THAT SOLELY REPRESENT LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO RECUSE HIMSELF FROM THE INVESTIGATION CHARGING OR PUT THE PROSECUTION OF OFFICER WHO IS A MEMBER OF THAT ASSOCIATION ADDITIONALLY THE BILL ONLY APPLIES IF THAT ASSOCIATION ALSO PROVIDES REPRESENTATION TO THE OFFICER OF THE CRIMINAL CASE. AFTER RECUSING THEMSELVES THEIR TOURNEY GENERAL SHALL ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CASE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THEN THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR SHALL BE ASSIGNED TO THE CASE. AMENDMENTS WERE MADE AND SENATE APPROPRIATIONS TO CLARIFY THAT THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST COULD EXIST BETWEEN THE ABOUT THE TIME THAT TENDED TO INDIVIDUAL FILES TO RUN FOR OFFICE FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR ATTORNEY GENERAL- TO THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR TERM PROSECUTORS ARE SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL ACTORS IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THEIR ROLE IS UNIQUE. AND UNLIKE MOST ELECTED OFFICIALS THEIR DUTY IS FOR IS TO BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND NOT SIMPLY MAKE POLICY CHOICES THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US. AND THEM- THIS IS CLEAR ETHICAL ISSUE AND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL BENEFIT GREATLY FROM ADDRESSING THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS BUILT DOES NOT PREVENT AN OFFICER FROM RECEIVING A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL OR PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIONS FROM DONATING TO CANDIDATES NOR DOES IT FOR A BIT- DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FROM ACCEPTING THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS. IT ONLY REQUIRES THOSE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO RECUSE THEMSELVES FROM A CRIMINAL CASE REMOVING ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR BUYERS ARE SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AT CENTER MORICHES. CLARIFICATION QUESTION TO THE- AUTOGRAPH MAY TAKE A QUESTION YES I WILL PLEASE PROCEED FURTHER BORDERS. WE REFERRED TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE REFERRING TO THE INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY ON A COUNTY BASIS OR THE ASSISTANT DA'S THAT COMPRISE THE PROSECUTORIAL TEAM. THROUGH THE JOURNEY SPECIFICALLY. OKAY SURE. I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT ONLY IN THE SITUATION WHERE THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY. HERE SHE IF HE OR SHE WERE TO DECIDE TO PROSECUTE THE CASE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE STANDPOINT. IF THEY GIVE THE GREEN LIGHT FOR THEIR- PROSECUTION DIVISIONS DIVISION HAS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CASE. THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE THAT INSTRUCTION THAT'S CORRECT IT'S A COMPLEX DATA WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD BE IN A VERY SIMILAR SITUATION ESSENTIALLY- NOT WISHING TO GET ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE THE ENTIRE STATE SYSTEM PROSECUTORS ALSO- DISQUALIFIED IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY I HAVE A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ASSIGNED TO JUST GOES TO THE THIRD THING NOT YET A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. AND THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE TO BE APPOINTED BY THE COURT. OR Y A. B. AG OR THE T. EIGHT DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXACTLY. ARE THE DOES THAT TAKE THE FORM OF ESSENTIALLY A- PUBLIC DEFENDER- BUT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SITUATION THEY BECOME A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR. I WOULD NECESSARY TO DESCRIBE IT AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER BUT A- SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO BE ASSIGNED TO I GUESS YOU WOULD MERIT SOMEWHAT OF A PUBLIC DEFENDER. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR BORJAS MEMBERS FURTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENT ABROAD FOR YOU MY CLOTHES ARE MEMBERS THIS IS A STRAIGHT FORWARD- MEASURE AS WE DISCUSSED IT OFF LAST WEEK WHEN WE DEALT WITH S. P.

SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY SIX BY SENATOR BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO STATE PARKS AND DECLARING THE URGENCY OF ARABS TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. CYNDER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A PROUD AUTHOR OF SB SEVEN NINE SIX. AND MY TEN PLUS YEARS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MORE IMPACTFUL BILL. THAT I CAN BE INVOLVED WITH- IN RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT THAT THIS WILL HAVE. ON NOT JUST ONE PARTICULAR AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY. BUT IT'S GOING TO SET AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT. REPARATIONS SHOULD AND COULD LOOK LIKE. NOT HERE NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT- IN THE NATION AS A WHOLE YESTERDAY WE HAD OUR FIRST. REPARATIONS TASK FORCE AND I'M HONORED TO SERVE ON AND I THINK OUR PROTEIN FOR POINTING ME. TO THIS TASK FORCE. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW. AND TWO THOUSAND I MEAN I'M SORRY IN NINETEEN TWELVE. AFRICAN AMERICAN COUPLE BY THE NAME OF CHARLES AND WILL OF BRUCE. BOUGHT A PIECE OF LAND IN MANHATTAN BEACH. THEY BOUGHT IT WITH INTENTIONS OF LIVING OUT THE AMERICAN DREAM OF OWNING A BUSINESS BUT ALSO ADHERING TO THOSE RULES THAT EXISTED AT THAT TIME. SEPARATE BUT EQUAL. THEY STARTED A RESORT A BATHHOUSE A DANCEHALL A RESTAURANT TO CATER TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION AND FROM THE DATE THAT BUSINESS WAS ESTABLISHED. IT WAS SUCCESSFUL. BUT THAT SUCCESS IN PUREDATA MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS MORE IMPORTANTLY THEIR WHITE NEIGHBORS AND THE BRUCE FAMILY AS WELL AS THE OTHER SIX FAMILIES TO ACQUIRE LAND ALONG MANHATTAN BEACH WERE HARASSED CONTINUOUSLY. NOT ONLY BY THE KKK BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY HAD THEIR TIRES SLASHED. THEY HAD THEIR FACILITIES BURN THEIR HOUSES SET AFIRE BUT DESPITE ALL THIS. THE BRUISES AND THOSE NEIGHBORS REMAIN CONSISTENT. IT SHOULDN'T BE LOST ON A SET JUST DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY WE RECOGNIZED THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TULSA MASSACRE. AND MANY FOLKS AS WELL WHAT IS THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED IN MANHATTAN BEACH THE DIFFERENCE IS NO ONE LOST THEIR LIFE TO MAN AND BEACH BUT THEY DID MURDER THE DREAM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES. WHO BELIEVE IN DOING THE RIGHT THING AS I STATED THEY PURCHASED THIS PROPERTY IN NINETEEN TWELVE. FOR TWELVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. AND AGAIN THEY WERE HARASSED CONSTANTLY AND IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN THE K. CLAN COULD NOT FINALLY RIGHT AROUND THE BRUCE IS OFF. AND THE OTHER SIX CITIES S. R. SIX FAMILIES. THE CITY OF MANHATTAN BEACH TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO USE. SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH EMINENT DOMAIN. THE TAKE THEIR PROPERTY AND AS WE'VE SEEN ALSO AND WHAT'S CALLED THE BLACK WALL STREET IN TULSA THEY USE EMINENT DOMAIN AFTER BURNING DOWN THAT TOWN. TO PREVENT THOSE COMMUNITIES FROM REBUILDING. THEY TOOK THIS PROPERTY IN TWO THOUSAND I MEAN NINETEEN. TWENTY FOUR. AND FINALLY REMOVE THEM FROM THEIR PLAN IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE NEVER TO BUILD A PARK. THE LANDS SET BACON UNTIL NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT AT THAT TIME IT WAS TRANSFERRED. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEEDED THE LAND TO THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES.AND FROM THERE THEY BUILT. A LIFEGUARD TRAINING SESSION THE US STATION. THIS BILL SIMPLY BEGINS THE TRANSFER OF RETURNING THIS PROPERTY TO THE RIGHTFUL OWNERS AND I WANT TO THANK. THE COURAGE OF SUPERVISOR JANICE HAHN AND THE FOUR OTHER AMAZING WOMEN ON LA COUNTY SUPERVISORS THAT HAD TO. COURAGE TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND HELP CORRECT THIS HORRIBLE WRONG THAT HAPPENED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS BILL THE PEOPLE OUT WAS IT UNIQUE AND AS WE'VE SEEN THIS IS NOT UNIQUE THERE'S HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF STORIES LIKE THIS THIS IS JUST ONE WORD IT'S STILL. THIS LAND OTHER THAN THE LIFEGUARD STATION STILL SITS AS IT WAS IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE WHEN THEY RAISE THE FACILITIES FROM THEIR PROPERTY. THIS BILL WILL NOT PROVIDE JUSTICE. BUT IT IS A SMALL MEASURE TO RETURN AND RECOGNIZE THE WRONG THAT THIS FAMILY WE ELIMINATED GENERATIONAL WEALTH. FROM THIS FAMILY AND THE SURROUNDING FOLKS WHO LIVED ON THIS LAND. THIS BILL IS A MODEL WHAT ECONOMIC JUSTICE SHOULD LOOK LIKE IN THIS COUNTRY THIS BILL WILL NOT A RACE AS I STATED BOTH HORRIBLE ACTS BUT IT REPRESENTS A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND A CLEAR STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. YES SANDERS CAN- THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND IT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ACT AND I WONDER HOW MANY MORE WE KNOW. THAT THERE WERE MANY MORE INCIDENCES PERHAPS NOT AS- AS OBVIOUS AS BRUCE'S BEACH BUT WE KNOW THERE WERE MANY OTHER INCIDENCES WHERE. AFRICAN AMERICANS. MRS WERE TAKEN OR THEY WERE DRIVEN OUT. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WE WILL NEVER KNOW THE EXTENT OF GENERATIONAL WEALTH THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE LONG TERM OPERATION OF BRIDGET BRUCE'S SPEECH NOT ONLY FOR THE BRUCE FAMILY BUT FOR ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES ALL OF WHOM OF COURSE NO LONGER HAD JOBS ONCE MANHATTAN BEACH. TOOK THE PROPERTY. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. D. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WEALTH OF AN AVERAGE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE WEALTH OF AN AVERAGE WHITE PERSON. YOU KNOW WHY DO MANY OF US HAVE THAT WEALTH AND I'M TALKING NOW ABOUT MYSELF AS A WHITE PERSON WE HAPPENED BECAUSE OUR FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO RETAIN THEIR BUSINESSES RETAIN THEIR PROPERTIES OWNED THEIR HOMES. AND THOSE THINGS INCREASED IN VALUE AND FOR ME FOR EXAMPLE I WAS ABLE TO PUT MY DAUGHTER THROUGH COLLEGE PART REFINE MY HOUSE. IF I HAD BEEN UNABLE TO OWN A HOUSE AND WE KNOW THAT KEEPS YOU KNOW NOT THATMANY YEARS AGO WITH COVENANTS AND REDLINING AND OTHER PRACTICES. A BLACK FAMILY COULDN'T OWN THE HOUSE THEN OF COURSE THAT COMPLETELY IMPACTED THEIR GENERATIONAL WEALTH I WAS STRUCK WELL I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THE TULSA MASSACRE. I WAS STRUCK IN THE REAR WITH RECENTLY WITH THE AMOUNT OF MEDIA ATTENTION THE SIXTY MINUTES- SPECIAL ON IT AND THEN MY OWN CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE GOING AND TALKING ABOUT. THE JUST HORRIFIC EVENTS THERE AND HOW IT WAS COMPLETELY BURIED FROM THE PUBLIC AND THAT EVEN BLACK RESIDENTS OF TULSA DID NOT KNOW THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HAPPENED NOW BACK TO BRUCE'S BEACH. THIS IS ONE. ALL TO CORRECT A WRONG IN CALIFORNIA WE I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MANY MORE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDIAN TO BRING IT FORWARD TO US. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- MY BROTHER ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO LIVE IN MANHATTAN BEACH INSTANT AND ACTUALLY SAID THAT IF THIS DID NOT MOVE FORWARD HE WOULD BE MOVING OUT BECAUSE HE DOES. CERTAINLY BELIEVE IN AND ENSURING THAT- ARE. THAT OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE- THIS SORT OF CORRECTION TO WHAT WAS AN EGREGIOUS AN AWFUL- THE ISSUE THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM AND SO I. WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS EFFORT AND I HOPE THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS A STATE IN LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL- REPARATIONS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN FIND. OPPORTUNITIES TO CORRECT THE WRONGS FROM THE PAST AND SO FOR THAT I URGE AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ CENTERMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE. CENTER BREVARD WE TAKE A QUESTION FROM SENATOR MAN THROUGH PLEASE PROCEED SENATOR MAN SO I'M READING THE BILL DESCRIPTION AND IT SAYS THAT THE BILLS PERMISSIVE. BUT THAT THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THE- BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AVENGERS COUNTY WILL TRANSFER THE LAND. IS IT MAYBE YOU CAN DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT FOR ME IS IT PERMISSIVE. IT IS A MATTER OF LOCAL CONTROL OR WE DICTATING RESULTS TO LA COUNTY. THE LAND WILL BE TRANSFERRED BACK TO THE BRUCE FAMILY THERE ANTHONY BRUCE- THROUGH THE ACTIONS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN BY THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES'S MANAGER- HERE TODAY REMOVES THOSE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE PLACE ON THE PROPERTY BACK IN NINETEEN. NINETY FIVE WHEN WE NEEDED IT TO THE COUNTER. AND SO JUST TO BE CLEAR FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION THAT MEANS THAT THE COUNTY'S ULTIMATELY MAKING DECISION NOT THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WE'RE THOSE RESTRICTIONS SO THE COUNTY CAN DO WHAT THEY DEEM IS RIGHT IN RETURN PROBABLY TO THE BRUCE FAMILY. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WE ARE ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT. PUBLIC ACCESS TO OUR BEACHES AND COASTLINES AND I ASSUME THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE MEASURES TAKEN BY THE LA. COUNTY TO ENSURE THAT- THE TRANSFER OF THIS WHOLE- NOT DIMINISH PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO ACCESS THE BEACH. I WOULD HOPE NO MORE THAN THEY DIMINISH THE BRUCE'S FAMILY FROM ACCESSING THEBEACH FRONT PROPERTY THAT THEY OWN FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS SO- I THINK- WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT. I APPRECIATE THAT- AND I WOULD JUST SAY AS WE HEAD TOWARDS JUNETEENTH. I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES IN GARDENA BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- LOOKING TO RECTIFY THE WRONGS OF THE PAST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT. AND I WANT TO JUST SAY PROPERTY AND IT'S BEEN GENERATIONAL IN OUR FAMILY AND MY FAMILY MANY OF YOU KNOW HOMESTEADED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND EMINENT DOMAIN IS SOMETHING THAT IS- USED AS A TOOL FOR THE GOOD OF THE PUBLIC THAT'S WHAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE BUILD ROADS AND SCHOOLS. THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR ALL THE PUBLIC. IN THIS CASE IT WASN'T GOOD FOR ALL THE PUBLIC IT WAS GOOD FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO. MUNA GENDER. AND THAT'S WRONG THAT'S NOT A PUBLIC THAT'S NOT WHAT EMINENT DOMAIN WAS SET FOR. AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT YOU KNOW. THIS COUNTRY IS IN A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT RIGHT. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. FIX THOSE WRONGS BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN THE COURSE OF HISTORY THAT DON'T REALLY ALWAYS ALLOW US THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. IN THIS CASE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WRONG RIGHT WHERE SOMEBODY'S LAYING. WHICH I GUARANTEE YOU AND IT DIDN'T BEING A PERSON OF COLOR OWNING LAND AND NAP TIME. IT'S NOT LIKE IT IS TODAY. SO FOR ME PERSONALLY AS A LANDOWNER AND SOMEBODY WHO. RESPECTS ATLANTA AND KNOWS WHAT IT IS TO TEND TO IT AND RUN A BUSINESS AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS. THIS IS A SUPER GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GIVE BACK TO LOCAL CONTROL WHICH THE STATE THIS BILL DOES NOTHING BUT GIVE THE CONTROL BACK TO. THE LOCALS TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HEARD THE HISTORY. ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON THIS PIECE OF LAND. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE FOLKS SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I WILL SHARE THAT MAYBE IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE- THIS IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHAT WE CAN DO. SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SO I ENCOURAGE MY VOTE ON SB SEVEN NINETY SIX AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I RISE A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND I THOUGHT TO BE WORTH JUST CLARIFYING FOR THE MEMBERS. VOTING ON THIS THAT. THE LOCATION ALSO THIS PROPERTY IS NOT DIRECTLY ON THE BEACH THE STRAND RUNS ALONG MANHATTAN BEACH THERE- BUT- PUBLIC ACCESS. IS ALREADY MAINTAINS- THE ISSUE IS THAT. WE'VE GOT AN- CAN INGEST IS EMBEDDED IN OUR LAW HERE AN S. AND THEIR THEFT OF PROPERTY THAT DATES BACK. DECADES THAT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED MY ONLY CONCERN IS WITH. AT THE CITY COUNCIL LEVEL IS MANHATTAN BEACH IMPOSES UNDUE RESTRICTIONS ON THE BREEZE FAMILIES RESUMPTION OF THEIR PRIVATE PROPERTY INTERESTS WE'RE GONNA HAVE ISSUES. AND SO I'M HOPING WITH THE PASSAGES OF THIS LEGISLATION AND ALL YOUR VOICES HERE THAT WE HAVE A EXPEDITED PROCESS FOR GETTING THIS WORK DONE. BUT THAT WE DON'T JUST STOP WITH THIS WORK THE FREEDOM SURF CAMP IS LITERALLY A BLOCK AWAY FROM THIS SITE. AND RIGHT NOW THEY SERVE KIDS IN MANHATTAN BEACH BUT NOT A FEW MILES INLAND- AND RIGHT NOW THE LA COUNTY LIFEGUARDS ARE GOING THROUGH JUNIOR GUARD AND FOUR THOUSAND KIDS ACROSS LA YOU'RE- GOING TO BE COME JUNIOR GUARDS. THOSE ARE MOSTLY WHITE KIDS. AT THE CULTURE AROUND THE BEACH ITSELF AND SHARING THESE RESOURCES HAS TO CHANGE AND- I HOPE THAT- THE CENTER FROM GUARDIAN IS LEGISLATION IS. JUST A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION- MUCH BROADER COMMITMENT- THIS IS FOR EVERYBODY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER STARRING MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR ALAN. I JUST WANNA RASO ADD MY VOICE IN SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND OBVIOUSLY IT INTO CLIFF I LOVE IT FOR MY OUR FRIEND FROM ORANGE COUNTY- MOVING FORWARD AS YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY THE- THE STRUCTURES OF THE COASTAL ACT IN THE COASTAL COMMISSION. HAD THEIR WORK WHILST WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE NOT BE INFRINGED UPON- I ALSO I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THIS BILL ALSO POINTS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COURAGEOUS INCISIVE. JOURNALISM AND THE LOS ANGELES TIMES AND A NUMBER OF OTHER- I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE JOURNALISTS AND NEWSPAPERS AND JOURNALISTIC OUTLETS THAT. ARE MORE ABLE TO AMPLIFY THIS IMPORTANT STORY RESEARCH IT. AND COME UP WITH A VERY COMPELLING NARRATIVE TO HELP. ILLUSTRATING AND SHED LIGHT ON SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE INJUSTICES THE PASS IT'S NOT THAT THIS WAS NOT A STORY THAT WASN'T KNOWN. BY FOLKS BUT JUST LIKE WITH THE TULSA MASSACRE THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT. PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT AND YET. IT REALLY WASN'T SOMETHING I GOTTEN PICKED UP- YOU KNOW BYE BYE AND MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND BY JOURNALISTS IN OUR TEXTBOOKS. THIS IS A SIMILAR SITUATION WE'VE GOT- SOME SOME REPORTERS WHO REALLY STEPPED UP AND PRODUCED SOME INCREDIBLE. I RESEARCH AND I JUST I RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE WANTS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. TO GO READ THE LA TIMES ARTICLES ABOUT THIS AD ABOUT THE STORY. AND IT'S A DISTRESSING STORY IT'S A STORY- THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS ALL TOO COMMON IN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO RECTIFY THIS BILL BY AUTHORIZING THE COUNTY. TO TO TRANSFER THIS LAND SO THAT I RESPECT FAST RIVAL. THE CENTRE ALAN. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING. SENT ABROAD FOR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE THE LINK TO YOUR VOICE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY YOUR SUPPORT TO THIS IMPORTANT. MEASURE I COULD BE HERE ALL DAY SPEAKING TO THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT I THINK. OUR ACTIONS HERE TODAY WILL SEND A MESSAGE CLEAR ACROSS THE STATE CLEAR ACROSS THIS NATION. THAT WE CAN RIGHT A WRONG. TELL ME YOUR RACE HISTORY NO. BUT I THINK IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ON WHY ETHNIC STUDIES IS SOLD IMPORTANT. IT SPEAKS TO WHY WE NEED TO TELL THE TRUTH OF AMERICAN HISTORY IN QUICK WHITEWASHING IT. IT'S A AFRICAN PROVERB THAT EXISTED STATES UNTIL THE HIGH. AS TOLD BY THE LION. THE STORY WILL ALWAYS FAVOR THE HUNTER. AND THAT'S WHAT AMERICAN HISTORY HAS BEEN ABOUT. AND AFTER AN AMERICAN'S MEXICAN AMERICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE SUFFERED HERE ASIAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE TOILED THE FIELDS WORKED HERE MANY TIMES OUR STORES ARE UNTIL. THEY WERE PREVENTED FROM OWNING PROPERTY THEY WERE PREVENTED FROM LIVING IN CERTAIN NEIGHBOURHOODS AND WHEN THEY DID. ACQUIRE PROPERTY AND TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING AGAIN OUR GOVERNMENT FOUND THE WAY MANY TIMES TO TAKE THAT PRIVILEGE AWAY. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT IF YOU CAN INHERIT GENERATIONAL WEALTH. YOU CAN INHERIT GENERATIONAL DEBT THE CITY OF MANHATTAN BEACH. OWES A DEBT TO THE BRUCE FAMILY. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES ALL THE DEBT TO THE BRUCE FAMILY. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL THAT DEBT AS WELL TO THE BRUCE FAMILY AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR JANICE HAHN SUPERVISOR HOLLY MITCHELL. SUPERVISOR HILDA SOLUTION SUPERVISOR BARBER. AND SUPERVISOR- JACKIE GOLDBERG FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO DO THE RIGHT THING FIVE AMAZING WOMEN WHO SAID WE HAVE TO CORRECT THIS AGAIN THE BRUCE'S ACQUIRED THIS PROPERTY IN NINETEEN TWELVE FOR. ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED. OUR JOBS ARE SHE'LL KILL I'M SORRY SHEILA KO. I STAND CORRECTED SUPERVISORS TO LOOK THROUGH THE KILL. FOR UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TODAY THE PROPERTY IS ESTIMATED AT A VALUE OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. THE BRUCE FAMILY AGAIN WITH ROB THAT THEIR LAND THEY WERE ROBBED OF THEIR BUSINESS THEY WERE MOBBED UP THEIR ECONOMIC FREEDOM. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY WERE ROBBED A GENERATIONAL WEALTH. THEY WERE FORCED TO MOVE OFF THIS LAND AND GO TO WORK FOR OTHER FOLKS. THEY SPENT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BEING IN EMPLOYMENT OF OTHER PEOPLE VERSUS BEING EMPLOYMENT FOR THEMSELVES. I ALSO WANT TO THANK AVAN WARD AN AMAZING RESIDENT AND MAN AND BEACH WHO LETTHE STORY BE TOLD. AS A PERSON WHO GREW UP IN THE SOUTH BAY WE HAD HEARD ABOUT. BRUCE'S BEACH BUT NOT TO THAT DEGREE. AS A KID GROWING UP AND RIDING MY BIKE TO THE BEACH TO PLAY IN THE WATER AND TRY TO LEARN HOW TO SURF. WE'RE HEARD RUMORS ABOUT. NOT ONLY MEN AND BEACH BUT THE INK WELL IN SANTA MONICA. AND VAL VERDE UP THE FIVE FREEWAY WHERE THESE WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN RESORTS THAT ONCE EXISTED BUT NO LONGER DO IT TODAY. BUT I ALSO WANNA GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO THE FORMER MAYOR MITCH WARD THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN AND ONLY AFTER AMERICAN TO BE ELECTED TO THAT CITY. WHO HAD THE COURAGE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. THEY ASKED HIS COUNSEL OR HIS COUNSEL TO TAKE A STANCE ON RECOGNIZING. THE BRUCE FAMILY. I WILL CLOSE ON THIS. I SAW A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG LADY STANDING ON A CORNER LAST FRIDAY AND SHE HAD A T. SHIRT ON THE SIMPLY STATED THE STOLEN MORE THAN WAS EVER LOOTED.

SIXTEEN IS A REINTRODUCTION OF SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX FROM LAST YEAR WHICH PASSED THE ASSEMBLY WITH BIPARTISAN VOTE BUT- DUE TO THAT LAST DAY OF SESSION IN THE TIME DEADLINE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO VOTE FOR IT ON OUR FLOOR. S. B. SIXTEEN IS A MODEST EXPANSION TO MY TWENTY EIGHTEEN BILL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH GAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FORTY YEARS PUBLIC ACCESS TO A LIMITED SET OF POLICE RECORDS WHAT IS B.

SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO M. ANIMAL TESTING. CENTER WINNER I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO FIFTY TWO- WHICH WILL BAN THE UNNECESSARY USE OF DOGS AND CATS AND TOXICITY TESTS. INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA WITH SOME EXEMPTIONS TOXICITY TESTING INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE FORCE FEEDING OR INJECTING ANIMALS WITH HARMFUL CHEMICALS. PESTICIDE OR OTHERWISE- TO SEE HOW SICK ANIMAL GUTS AND WHETHER THE ANIMAL- DICE SOME OF THESE TESTS INVOLVED OVERDOSING DOGS AND ADMINISTERING CHEMICALS OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME CAUSING HORRIFIC PAIN FOR EXAMPLE- SHOVING PESTICIDE DOWN THE DOG'S THROAT EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR. TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DOG. DOGS AND CATS. SUFFER GREATLY FROM THIS TYPE OF TESTING WHICH WE NOW KNOW IS LARGELY INEFFECTIVE AND NOT SUPPORTED BY CURRENT SCIENCE AND YET IT IS STILL HAPPEING. WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT BANS ALL ANIMAL TESTING IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE SALE OR MANUFACTURE OF DRUGS. DOES NOT STOP ANY CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH A REVOLUTIONARY DRUG DISCOVERY THIS BILL IS WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY TO PROHIBIT TYPE SINCE CITY TESTING. CARRIED OUT ON DOGS AND CATS THAT SERVES NO REGULATORY REQUIREMENT OR EVEN A REGULATORY RECOMMENDATION IN FACT WE HAVE- PROVISION AND THAT IF THE FDA RECOMMENDS TOXICITY DOG TOXICITY TESTING FOR DRUGS- THE COMPANY CAN DO IT. SO THE BILLS FLEXIBLE IT'S SCIENCE BASED AND IT DESERVES YOUR SUPPORT- WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH- SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS- WHO'VE EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL WE'VE ACCEPTED VARIOUS AMENDMENTS IS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. BUT IN THE END COLLEAGUES- WE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWING- THESE HORRIFIC TOXICITY TESTS WHICH ARE. JUST NOT SUPPORTED BY SCIENCE WE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWING THEM ON DOGS AND CATS. AND I RESPECT WAREHOUSE FOR AN IPO. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR COM LONGER. RISE IN SUPPORT. OF SB TWO FIVE TWO I WANT TO SAY IN TWENTY TWENTY BEFORE THE SESSION WAS IMPACTED BY KOBE I INTRODUCED THE PREDECESSOR TO THIS BILL AB TWENTY FIFTY NINE IN THE ASSEMBLY WHERE IT WAS OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTED IN ITS FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. S. B. TWO FIVE TWO IT'S A MORE DEVELOPED VERSION OF LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT REFLECTS ALL OF THE WORK. THE SPONSORS HAVE DONE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION. AND TO REFINE THE BILL'S NUMEROUS EXEMPTIONS. AND ALSO I WANT TO POINT OUT IT BANS THE USE OF TESTING ON DGS AND CATS AND WHEN I BROUGHT THIS UP TO MY CAT KISI GIRL SHE WAS VERY EXCITED. I WAS COMPELLED TO INTRODUCE THIS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR WHEN I LEARNED THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY TOXICITY TESTING ON DOGS. WAS STILL HAPPENING IN LABORATORIES INCLUDING SEVERAL IN CALIFORNIA. AND I HOPE THAT I AM NOT ALONE IN BEING ALARMED BY THIS FACT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN CONDUCT THIS KIND OF TESTING ON OTHER ANIMALS IF YOU CHOOSE WHO ARE YOU KNOW LIKE MICE AND ALL OF THAT AND ALSO ON COMPUTER GENERATED COMPARABLE IS THAT GIVE YOU THE SAME KIND OF RESULTS. THE EFFICACY WITH THOSE KINDS OF TESTS IS AS HIGH AS TESTING ON DOGS AND CATS SO WHY KILL THEM. JUST FOR TEST I AM ENCOURAGING MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE HI ONE S. B. TWO FIVE TWO.

DUE TO THE ACTIONS OF POLICE OR IN THE CASES OF PEOPLE KILLED BY POLICE TO BE ABLE TO BURY THEIR LOVED ONES WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE A COUPLE CLARIFICATIONS RECENT AMENDMENTS CLARIFIED THE SP TWO NINE NINE EXCLUDES PEOPLE AND FAMILY MEMBERS IF THE PERSON INJURED OR KILLED FIVE. BECAUSE SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH TO ANOTHER PERSON IN THOSE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES POLICE ARE OF COURSE ALLOWED TO USE DEADLY FORCE UNDER AB. THREE NINETY TWO. PERSON WHO IS IN HER. OR IS ON PROBATION OR PAROLE FOR SERIOUS OFFENSE CANNOT RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION PROGRAM. THE CURRENT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR FILING A CLAIM WITH THE B. C. B. S. SEVEN YEARS CONTENT THIS BILL IS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IF ENACTED WILL MAKE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF VICTIMS OF POLICE VIOLENCE. AFTER ALL IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE VICTIMS OF POLICE VIOLENCE FAR AS DESERVING. AND AS MUCH A VICTIM AS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MEMBERS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A POT OF MONEY. FOR PEOPLE TO WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED BY POLICE VIOLENCE TO GET THIS IS A REIMBURSEMENT FUND AND IT IS THE PAYER OF LAST RESORT. SO THIS IS FOR BASICALLY THREE THINGS IF I AM HARMED BY POLICE I CAN RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR MY HOSPITAL BILLS I CAN SEE RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR COUNSELING I MAY HAVE HAD. I CAN SEE MY FAMILY CAN RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR FUNERAL COSTS IF I WERE KILLED BY POLICE THIS IS NOT A POT OF MONEY AND KILL THE C. B. STILL HAS TO APPROVE THIS. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'LL VOTE. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR WORLD. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. YOUR LIVER WILL YOU TAKE A QUESTION FROM WELL OF COURSE THANK YOU MAN AND MEDICINE- I JUST- I APPRECIATE YOUR INTENT AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING ON THIS BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION- AND I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU TOOK TO NARROW THE BILL SIGNIFICANTLY. I HAVE A QUESTION- DOES THIS ACTUALLY EXPAND- RESTITUTION TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE INITIATED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OR WERE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. DURING AN ARREST WHERE SOMETHING HAPPENS TIME WILL TELL HOWEVER THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AT THE TIME KNOW IF YOU WERE COMMITTING A CRIME DURING THE TIME. THIS IS NOT APPLY TO YOU DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR FAMILY. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT ON MY OWN TIME. YOU KNOW IN RETURN THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THE REASON WHY I BRING THAT UP IS JUST RECENTLY MY COLLEAGUE- THAT I SURE SAMBAR TO DINO COUNTY FOR WE HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. THAT WAS SHOT AND KILLED AND HE WAS ACTUALLY- IN PURSUIT OF A MOTORCYCLE INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS SAM VIOLATING THE LAW. AND THE MOTORCYCLE INDIVIDUAL DROPPED HIS BIKE TOOK OFF RUNNING OVER A SAND DUNE. AND WHEN THE OFFICER AND WHEN THE OFFICERS LAID CHASE HE WENT OVER THE TOP OF A SAND DUNE IN THE INDIVIDUAL WAS LAYING IN WAIT AND SHOT IT. AND SO HIS END OF WATCH WAS JUST THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY. SO MY CONCERN IS- JUST SHARING THAT STORY OF JUST EVERY DAY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THE PUTS ON THEIR UNIFORM HAS NO IDEA WHAT THEIR DAY IS GOING TO ENTAIL. AND I THINK I APPLAUD THE OTHER FOR MAKING SURE THAT. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THE- IN THE- IN THE- OF- IN THE- IN THE PROCESS OF. COMMITTING A CRIME. AND THE OFFICER ENGAGES THAT PERSON- THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IF SOMETHING DID HAPPEN THAT WAS UNFORESEEN. FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT THE OFFICER WOULD NOT BE. A THERE WOULD NOT BE RESTITUTION AND AVAILABLE TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF COMMITTING. A CRIME. AND SO I DIDN'T SEE THOSE AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK THAT OF THE AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE. THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRESS FITTING YOUR CLOTHES YEAH. OKAY ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ON THIS MEASURE. TURNING TO A NINE CENT EARLIER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT IT IS NOT AN AMENDMENT- THAT YOU WOULD SEE IT IN IT IS PART OF THE BILL THAT IF YOU ARE ACTIVELY. SHOOTING SOMEONE OR INJURING SOMEONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU YOURSELF WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY COMPENSATION NOR WOULD YOUR FAMILY SO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE OR THE- THE- EXAMPLE THAT MY COLLEAGUE GAVE OF COURSE THAT PERSON WOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANYTHING FROM THE VICTIM'S COMPENSATION PORT. AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE VERY CLEAR WE DON'T CONVOLUTED THE ISSUE. CLEARLY WE DON'T EVER WANT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE SHOT AT OR KILLED AS WHAT HAPPENED BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT VICTIMS OF POLICE VIOLENCE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS BOARD SO MEMBERS IT IS A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE IT WOULD ALLOW FOR MEMBER FOR VICTIMS OF POLICE VIOLENCE TO BE REIMBURSED AGAIN IT IS NOT A POT OF MONEY. IF THERE WERE ANY CIVIL ACTION AND THAT VICTIM RECEIVE SOME SORT OF COMPENSATION THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY BACK THE ACCOUNT BCB BOARD CALVI C. B. AS A PAYER OF LAST RESORT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON. FILE ITEM FORTY SEVEN. ALAN ARCHULETA I. ATKINS I BASICS NO BACKER.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE. SENATE BILL FOUR OH SIX BY SENATOR STERN AN ACT RELATING TO OIL AND GAS. SURE CERN FOR SHORT. THANK YOU MEMBERS- THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- MEMBERS THIS BILL WOULD. TIGHTEN UP OPERATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION OR CAL JAM THE STATE AGENCY THAT OVERSEES OIL AND GAS WELL OPERATIONS- JUST JUST TODAY ACTUALLY AN ARTICLE WAS RELEASED IN PROPUBLICA. DOCUMENTING. A SPATE OF VIOLATIONS FROM. ONE OPERATOR THAT TELLS THE STORY OF SO MANY OPERATORS IN THE STATE- SMALL OPERATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO MAITAIN THEIR SAFETY OR THEIR WELL OPERATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY LIVING RIGHT BEHIND SOMEBODY'S HOUSE. SERGIO AGUILAR LIVES IN PORTSMOUTH HOTEL THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE NASCO PETROLEUM SITE DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES SERGIO UNDER CURRENT LAW HAS NO VOICE IN THE COUNT HIM PROCESS. TO RAISE ISSUES OF SAFETY VIOLATIONS JUST LIKE SO MANY OTHER NON HOMEOWNER RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE TO BE ACTUALLY A HOMEOWNER IN AN ESTABLISHED RESIDENTS FEEL THE RAISE COMPLAINTS OR HAVE A VOICE IN THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROCESS RIGHT NOW. THIS BILL WOULD RESTORE COMMUNITY VOICE FOR ALL THOSE FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES LIVING WITH THE OIL AND GAS WELLS IN THEIR BACKYARDS BUT IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE INSPECTION REPORTS AND ENFORCEMENT MATTERS TO ME MADE PUBLIC WE KNOW THAT- FROM- TWENTY NINETEEN INVESTIGATION. THAT A NUMBER OF SPILLS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WERE NOT UNDERTAKEN IN THE PENALTIES ASSESSED CONNECTION NOT BEEN COLLECTED. BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY CAL JAM ISSUED SIXTY SIX ENFORCEMENT ORDERS AND JUST ELEVEN OF THOSE HAVE BEEN COMPLIED WITH BUT THE VAST. MAJORITY REMAINING OUTSTANDING- THE IS WELL CAL PUB- THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT EACH AND WELL- THAN ME BEING OUR OR MAY NOT- CURRENTLY- NOT TRANSPARENT AND NEED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION. BOTH IN I. T. ISSUE A PAPER DOCUMENTATION ISSUE- AND IN A MATTER OF WILL SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THISLACK OF TRANSPARENCY WILL WILL BE RECTIFIED FOR ALL THE RESIDENTS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THE INTEGRITY OF THIS INSTITUTION AS WE- SEEK TO MAKE CALIFORNIA'S OIL AND GAS WELL REGULATION OPERATION THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY WE ARE NOT THERE YET BUT THIS THIS TAKES US IN THAT DIRECTION. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER THE- OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING SEEN NINE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON FILE I'M SORRY I'M SORRY HI THE REFLECTION RIGHT INTO IT SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR OH SIX I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY NOT LESS. WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I HAD THE LSO CANYON- FACILITY IN MY DISTRICT WHICH HAS YOU KNOW HAD A MAJOR GAS LEAKS FOR MANY MONTHS- MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW IS IF THAT WAS NECESSARY TO GAS THAT CAUSE PEOPLE BEING ILL. BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REPURPOSED OIL FIELD IT WASALL THE CHEMICALS THAT FELL INTO THE GROUND. FROM THAT- WHEN THAT HAPPENED I STARTED AROUND THE ROOM MIGHT JUST AND I LIVE FOUR MILE OF ANOTHER OFFICER VERY MUCH LIKE. AND WHEN IT WAS FIRST. BUILT THERE'S NOTHING AROUND IT NOW IT'S SURROUNDED BY HOMES IS SURROUNDED BY A CHARTER SCHOOL. AND I JUST THINK- ARE. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. AND I THINK THIS IS AN A PRUDENT MEASURE TO INFORM THEM SO THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEST FOR THEM SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR NO VOTE ON SP FOUR OH SIX. THANK YOU. BREAUX CAN MR PRESIDENT I RAISING CAUTIOUS SUPPORTED THIS BILL- I BELIEVE THAT TRANSPARENCY IS VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WITH COMES FROM THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN TRANSPARENCY SPECIFICALLY IN KERN COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL- THAT IS CONSUMED BY ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD AND WE REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE I APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES FROM FREMONT A FEW YEARS AGO THE TRANSPARENCY BILL ON FRACKING AND- DATA DATA THAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED SHOWS THAT IT IS DONE VERY SAFELY AND IT IS- PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT IS ONE OF THE SAFEST PROCEDURES ESPECIALLY THE WAY THAT WE OPERATE IN THE REGULATORY CLIMATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I THINK DATA IS GOOD AND TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD- I THINK THE BEAST THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE FUNDED AGAIN BY INDUSTRY. WHERE THE CALCIUM ORGANIZATION OF THE CAL JAM DEPARTMENT IS FUNDED COMPLETELY BY INDUSTRY THE OUTRAGE WILL BE FUNDED BY INDUSTRY- AND SO- AGAIN IN TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD I JUST THINK THAT AS WE- REQUEST WE REQUEST STUFF TO BE DONE TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC AND E REQUEST AS LEGISLATORS FOR OTHER ITEMS SO THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE MADE AWARE AND MAKES ME THINK OF A SCRIPTURE JOSE FOR SIX IS MY PEOPLE PERISH FOR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE. ABOUT THE OIL INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THINGS THAT WE CARE ABOUT- BUT WE ALWAYS PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THOSE RESEARCH PROJECTS AND THOSE TRANSPARENCY PROJECTS BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT WE ARE REQUIRING THE INDUSTRY TO PAY FOR THIS OUT REACH- I REALIZE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS DATA BUT- I THINK FUNDING COULD BE PROVIDED SO- A CAUTIOUSLY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITION DISK OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF. IN CHINO SOONER DURING WHICH A LOT. YES THANK MISTER PRIME. TO MY COLLEGE OF SENT THREE AND BIG. APPRECIATE INPUT AND ENGAGE HERE- I TOO SHARED THAT. THAT'LL BE SO CAN'T AREA TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE LIVING. ON OIL AND GAS SITES ON BURIED WELLS- THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR MY FAMILY IN THE PICO AREA. WITH- RIGHT BEHIND THE SYNAGOGUE IT. BY IN LAWS GO TO- THERE'S A- BIG BUILDING AND YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL WHAT'S IN THE BUILDING BUT THEY REALIZE ACTUALLY IT'S- A BUNCH OF OIL WELLS IN THAT BUILDING THAT HAVE BEEN LEAKING BENZENE AND OTHER ITEMS OVER THE YEARS AND- WASN'T EVEN SHOWING UP ON THE MAPS IN THE COMMUNITY. LACKS THAT BASIC INFORMATION ON POWER THEMSELVES TO GO OUT AND LOOK AFTER THEIR FAMILIES SO WE OWE THEM AT LEAST THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT- THE BILLS DESIGNED RIGHT THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULDN'T. PAY FOR THE ACCESS-TO THAT INFORMATION- THAT TRANSPARENCY OUGHT TO COME AS A RESPONSIBILITY OF. MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM OIL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA- SO I THINK IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO WONDERS. WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS AS YOU MAY RECALL WE ALL PASSED A COUPLE BILLS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. THAT REPEALED THE CRIMINAL SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS THAT ADDED THREE YEARS OF INCARCERATION TO DEFENDANTS FOR EACH PRIOR DRUG OFFENSE THAT WAS. CENTER MITCHELL'S BILL MINUTES AND WE KNOW HOW TO BUILD. THAT- ADDED WHEN- ONE YEAR IN CARS FOR EACH PRIOR PRISON OR FELONY JAIL TERM. NOW LET'S JUST REMEMBER FOLKS THAT WHEN YOU ARE COMEDIAN WHEN YOU ARE CONVICTED OF A CRIME YOU ALREADY HAVE A ROBUST- PUNISHMENT JAIL TIME ASSOCIATED AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER ENHANCEMENTS ANOTHER. ADDED ON- MITIGATING AND PUNISHMENTS- BUT BUT THEY WE TOOK A LONG HARD LOOK AT THESE TWO PARTICULAR pFOR PRIOR IS ASSOCIATED WITH- A PRIVATE PRISON IN PRIOR DRUG OFFENSES AND DECIDED THAT THEY JUST DO IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA. IT JUST DOESN'T SHOW THAT THEY DO ANYTHING TO HELP WITH THE GUARDS TO. RECIDIVISM IT SECTOR. SO CALIFORNIA COMEDIAN REVISION THE PENAL CODE. AND CAME OUT WITH A COUPLE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS. THIS IS A BUILDING DIRECTLY- DESCENDS FROM THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND IT WILL RETROACTIVELY APPLY. THESE REPEAL PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS TO PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA JAILS AND PRISONS AND PRISONS WERE CONVICTED PRIOR TO THEIR APPEAL. THE IDEA BEING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE. A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER SENTENCE BECAUSE YOU'RE CONVICTED. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN RATHER THAN HI TWENTY NINETEEN AND THAT'S IT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND AS I SAY RECENT STUDIES BY THE US SENTENCING COMMISSION FOUND THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF SENTENCE REDUCTIONS IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM HAVE HAD NO MEASURABLE IMPACT. ON RECIDIVISM RATES THERE'S BEEN SIMILAR STUDIES DONE IN MARYLAND MICHIGAN FLORIDA. THAT HAVE COME TO SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS AND SOME LIGHT IN THIS RESEARCH AND FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF A WIDE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS WE- EFFECTIVELY CREATE PARITY. TEMP WORLD PARITY APPLYING TO LIKE A LOT USUALLY BY RETROACTIVELY REPEALING WHAT. EVIDENCE SHOWS ARE INEFFECTIVE THREE YEAR.

ON THIS ISN'T JUST- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ISSUE IT'S ALSO BEEN A MAJOR. ISSUE IN THE LOS ANGELES VENTURA COUNTY AREAS THAT I REPRESENT AND ALL THE WAY AND KERN COUNTY AND EVERYWHERE BASE AT THE SANTA ANA WINDS BLOW. AND THE WILDFIRES MOVE OF WE'VE SEEN POWER TAKEN DOWN AFFECTING AVERAGE OF FIFTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AT A TIME- AVERAGE AVERAGES OF THIRTY HOURS IN DURATION WAS SOME LASTING AS LONG AS SEVEN DAYS- OCCURRING DURING HOLIDAYS DURING THE PANDEMIC DURING TIMES AND PEOPLE ARE. ZOOMING THERE HAVE BEEN A FALSE ALARMS AND KEPT PENDING POWER OUTAGES CAUSING STRESS AND TRAUMA ANXIETY. THE ELDERLY BEING IMPACTED LOSS OF MEDICATION FOOD AND THE LIST GOES ON. I'M FOR MOST COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY P. S. P. S. KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON- IS NOT JUST A FREEZE IT'S A- IT'S A MANDATE IT HAS TO HAPPEN THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A LAST RESORT OPTION- BUT- YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN IS. BEING USED TOO LIBERALLY AND- WITHOUT ENOUGH MITIGATION IN PLACE SO THIS BILL WOULD. REQUIRE OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO REPORT IN THEIR WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. THE ENERGY CIRCUITS THAT ARE FREQUENTLY BEING DE ENERGIZED FROM PS PS EVENTS. AND THE MEASURES THAT THEY'RE TAKING OR PLANNING TO TAKE TO FIX THESE ENERGY CIRCUIT SO THAT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES CAN REALLY PLAN AROUND THIS WORK AND GET PREPARED- WE'VE BEEN HEARTENED TO SEE THE WORK FOR MEDICINE LOCALLY AND THE HEADS UP NOW BEING GIVEN ABOUT THEIR RESTORATION PLANS USING THE HELICOPTERS GOING OVERHEAD. LOOKING AT THE WIRE LINES AND- GETTING AUTO RECLOSERS IN PLACE AND HARDENING THEIR TRANSMISSION CIRCUITS- BUT IT'S FRANKLY NOT ENOUGH- WE CANNOT HAVE A REPEAT OF WHAT WE HAD LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT- SO. WITH THIS- SP NINETY NINE WHICH IS ALSO BEING CURED OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA.AND CRUCIAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET HOPEFULLY WE CAN START TO TURN THE CORNER HERE AND- KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. FOR CALIFORNIA THROUGH THIS NEW THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ONE OF FIRE. AND WITH INTEREST ASK. ANY ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION OF DEBATE ON THE ITEM SIR OUT. MY THANK YOU MR MEMBERS I. WANT TO DO THIS CLICK I VOTED AGAINST IN THE ENERGY BUT IT'S BEEN HE'S THAT THE DOG TAKEN IN- I'D I KNOW THAT- MANY OF- IN THE NORTH HAVE BEEN. FACED WITH THE THESE PS PS AND- IT'S REALLY IMPACTED OUR COMMUNITIES IN SPECIALLY THOSE WHO OWN BUSINESSES- FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU OWN A STORE IN YOUR REFRIGERATION IS OUT FOR A WHILE YOU LOSE ALL THE PRODUCTS IN THERE AND THEN YOU TURN IT BACK YOU GET BACK GOING IN AND THAT COMES AGAIN AND SO TRANSPARENCY IS KEY. RIGHT NOW FOR- THOSE AREAS AND WE KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS WE HAVE WINDOW VENTS WHERE IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND THE WAY THAT THE WINDS COME IN SO- THIS IS A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO BE ABLE TO HELP GET THOSE FOLKS EDUCATED ON WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.

THIS BILL WOULD IMPROVE INDEPENDENT AUDITS OF NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL SOMETIMES CALLED INDEPENDENT STUDY. TO GIVE US A BETTER CHANCE OF CATCHING FRAUD BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL THIS BILL IS BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. WHICH UNCOVERED AND PROSECUTED IN NATURE SCHOOL FRAUD CASE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY- SP FIVE NINE THREE WOULD REQUIRE AUDITORS TO BE SPECIALLY TRAINED TO SPOT RED FLAGS FOR FRAUD. VERIFY RANDOM SAMPLES OF ENROLLMENT. FLAG QUESTIONABLE EXPENDITURES AND CALL OUT LARGE FINANCIAL TRANSFERS. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ADD NEW TRANSPARENCY AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE HIRING OF PRIVATE VENDORS WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS. NO NO SAFEGUARD CAN NEVER STOP EVERY CRIMINAL DETERMINED TO CHEAT THE SYSTEM AND STEAL PUBLIC FUNDS. BUT WE CAN DO MORE TO TRY TO PREVENT THESE CRIMES AND WE CAN DO IT IN A STRATEGIC WAY THAT DOES NOT PUNISH THE MANY ETHICAL CHARTER SCHOOL MANAGERS AND pINTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AT HEART.

SENATE BILL SEVEN THIRTY ONE BY SENATOR DURAZO AN AXE A RELATED CRIMINAL RECORDS SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I'M PROUD TO STAND HERE TO PRESENT IS B. SEVEN THIRTY ONE ON SUNSET IN CONVICTIONS RECORDS. THERE ARE EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIVING WITH UNDER ARREST OR CONVICTION ON THEIR RECORD. THEY ARE SIBLINGS OUR PARENTS OUR NEIGHBORS CO WORKERS AND FELLOW CHURCH GOERS. WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL COMPLETES THEIR SENTENCE THERE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY THEY'VE ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS WHILE THEY ARE INCARCERATED MANY OF THEM TOOK CLASSES OR IN ROLDAN COUNSELING. THEY PURSUE THE REHABILITATION AND WORKED HARD TO BE PREPARED FOR THE RE ENTRY INTO OUR COMMUNITY. BUT AFTER THE RELEASE INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO PUT THEIR NEW SKILLS TO USE AND BEGIN TO BUILD A NEW LIFE FOR THEMSELVES. THEY ARE HIT WITH LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS THAT KEEP THEM FROM BUILDING A NEW LIFE. CALIFORNIA MAINTAINS AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONVICTION RECORDS UNTIL THEY REACH A HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE. WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE DENIED ACCESS TO STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING BECAUSE OF A PAST ARREST OR CONVICTION THEY ARE PUSHED INTO THE MARGINS OF SOCIETY. WHERE THEY ARE LEFT WITH FEWER LEGITIMATE OPTIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS BILL WILL EXTEND CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING SYSTEM FOR ARREST AND CONVICTION RECORD RELIEF IN THREE WAYS ONE. WILL EXTEND ARREST RECORD SEALING TO FELONY ARRESTS BUT ONLY IF THE INDIVIDUAL WAS NEITHER CHARGED NOR CONVICTED SIX YEARS AFTER THE ARREST SECOND. IT WILL EXTEND AUTOMATIC CONVICTION RECORD RELIEF. TO NON SERIOUS AND NON VIOLENT FELONIES AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL COMPLETES ALL TERMS OF INCARCERATION PROBATION SUPERVISION. POST RELEASE. SUPERVISION PAROLE AND A FURTHER PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS WITHOUT ANY NEW CONVICTIONS. IT WILL THREE ALLOW INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF A SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONY TO PETITION THE COURT. FOR STEALING RELIEF THESE PETITIONS ARE DONE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THE COURTS MAKE THE FINAL DECISION. AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DENIED EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF PAST. RECORDS IN THIS LAST YEAR ALONE. MANY PEOPLE WITH THE CONVICTION FROM PAS CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES IS THE LEADING DRIVER OR RECIDIVISM IT DESTABILIZES FAMILIES UNDERMINES OUR ECONOMY AND MAKES OUR COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE. A PAST RECORD DENIES A FAMILY FROM MOVING INTO A NEW HOUSE IT DENIES MOTHERS THE CHANCE TO PURSUE A NEW CREER. THROUGH EDUCATION AND IT DENIES FATHERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO COACH THEIR CHILDREN. WE WANT TO GIVE INDIVIDUALS THE MEANS TO OVERCOME THE SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS THAT A PAST RECORD BRINGS BUT INSTEAD LET'S PUT THEM ON THE PATH TOWARDS STABILITY AN OPPORTUNITY. NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN BUT FOR OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY. SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE DOES NOT CHANGE HOW EXPUNGEMENT RELIEF INTERACTS WITH OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING AND IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO EXISTING LICENSING DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS. THERE ARE HIGH SENSITIVITY LICENSING AGENCIES EMPLOYERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO ALL RECORDS INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT- REGULATED HEALTH WORK- INVOLVING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS- HUMAN SERVICES WORK INVOLVING CARE OF CHILDREN THE ELDERLY OR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SECURITY BANKING COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING SEVEN THIRTY ONE INCLUDES STRINGENT OVERSIGHT AND STRICT SCRUTINY AT EVERY SINGLE STAGE. IN EVERY INSTANCE IT PROVIDES AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WEIGH IN ON ANY POTENTIAL RELIEF GRANTED. IT IS SUPPORTED BY A VERY VERY BROAD COALITION OF. CRIMINAL JUSTICE ECONOMIC JUSTICE BUSINESS GROUPS COMMERCIAL GROUPS. RELIGIOUS FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE THIS MODEST STEP TO GIVE SOME INDIVIDUALS THE TOOLS TO TURN THE PAGE ON THE PAST AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BUILD A NEW BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND I URGE AND I'VE- THANK YOU ANY DESCRIPTION OR DEBATE SENATOR HER. MR PRESIDENT SAID FOR MEASURE PRESS TO THIS ON THE SPOT VOTER TODAY. A DEEP MORAL. WHEN SOMEONE MAKES A MISTAKE IN SOCIETY. IS CONVICTED BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS. THEY PAY THAT DEBT TO SOCIETY THROUGH A PRISON TERM OF PROBATION ALL SORTS OF OTHER MATTERS. THE QUESTION IS IT A LIFE SENTENCE. BECAUSE IN FACT WHEN YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD. TRAILS YOU IT BECOMES A LIFE SENTENCE IT BECOMES A SCAR ON WHO YOU ARE. DON'T WE AS A SOCIETY DON'T WE IS A MORAL PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BOTH ON THE ONE HAND EXTRACT PENALTIES FOR PEOPLE THAT VIOLATE DEEP SOCIETAL RULES BUT DON'T WE HAVE COMPASSION IN OUR HEARTS TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THEIR LIVES WITHOUT A LIFETIME SCAR. SO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE BECAUSE IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS IN TERMS OF OUR VALUES. THE RIGHT THING TO DO I ASKED FOR YOUR IPHONE. THINK CENTRE HERZBERG SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FERNANDO VALLEY- AND APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES MOST ENGINES FOR THIS BILL. IF WE BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION AS A PURPOSE OF INCARCERATION- WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE DENIED TO. CONVICTS EX CONVICTS IT'S JUST REMARKABLE AND NEED OF REDRESS AND I ALSO WANT TO PLUG MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAME GOES FOR THE THOUGHTFUL MOMENTS THAT SHE TOOK THAT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES SERIOUS VIOLENT AND SEX FELONIES FROM AUTOMATIC RELIEF- THESE ARE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE. THAT THERE'S A RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND THE NEED TO TRY TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EX CONVICTS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I URGE NIVEAU. THANK YOU ANY FOR DISCUSS OR TO.

SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE BY SENATOR BACKER IN ACTS RELATING TO MURDER. SENATOR BOOKER. GOOD AFTERNOON MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS BODY PASSED SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AUTHORED BY SENATOR SKINNER WITH BI PARTISAN SUPPORT. AT THAT BILL CHANGED CALIFORNIA'S LONG HELD UNJUST FELONY MURDER LAW THAT WAS OVERLY PUNITIVE TO THOSE WHO DID NOT KILL OR INTEND TO KILL. A LOT OF PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE WHO TOOK PLEA DEALS TO LESSER CHARGES SUCH AS MANSLAUGHTER TO APPLY FOR RESENTENCING. IT WAS A LANDMARK PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT TRANSFORMED OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO BE ONE THAT LIVES UP TO OUR IDEALS OF FAIRNESS. JUSTICE AND EQUITY. HOWEVER WHAT HAS OCCURRED SINCE SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IS THAT SOME COURTS IN CORRECTLY REASONED THAT ONLY APPLIED TO MURDER AND NOT ATTEMPTED MURDER. THESE COURTS HAVE BARRED PEOPLE FROM APPLYING FOR RESENTENCING WHICH IS LED TO AN ABSURD AND UNFAIR SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESENTENCING. IF THE VICTIM DIED BUT ARE INELIGIBLE WITH THE VICTIM DID NOT DIE. THIS MEANS AT LEAST CULPABLE PEOPLE ARE STILL SERVING DECADES. IN PRISON EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF. AT B. SEVEN SEVEN FIVE BILLS ON SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BY CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW TO CLUE INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER CONVICTIONS AS ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF UNDER S. PEEN SP FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR COUNSEL TO BE APPOINTED IN PETITIONS FOR RESENTENCING ESTABLISHES A PROCESS FOR THOSE WHOSE MURDER ATTEMPTED MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTIONS IT'S FINAL TO APPEAL. THE SIMPLE REFORM WHICH HAS HUNDREDS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE THAT THE POWER CHORDS TEAMS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED BY THE TECHNICAL LANGUAGE IS LANGUAGE OF SP FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. AND THE THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR PEOPLE WHO DID NOT FILE PETITIONS YET BECAUSE OF THE COURT RULINGS.

SENATOR CORTESE MOVES A CALL NOW MEMBERS WERE MOVING ON TO FALL ITEM SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR GLAZIER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY TWO BY SENATOR GLAZER AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION CENTER GLAZIER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SB SEVEN NINETY TWO WOULD REQUIRE RETAILERS WITH ONLINE SALES TOTALING MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS. TO REPORT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION THE CITY OR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF THE PURCHASERS FOR ALL TAXABLE SALES. TRANSACTION TRANSACTED ONLINE. THIS BILL IS A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE DESIGNED TO SHED LIGHT ON THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM LOCAL SALES TAX LAW. UNDER BRADLEY BYRNE SALES TAX REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE POINT OF SALE. FOR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES THIS MEANS ALLOCATING THE REVENUE TO THE JURISDICTION THE STORES LOCATED IN. ONLINE RETAILERS HOWEVER HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE SALES TAX REVENUE. BE THAT A WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER OR SALES OFFICE. THIS ALLOWS CORPORATIONS TO DIRECT REVENUE TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. AND NOW CORPORATIONS HAVE USE THIS AS LEVERAGE WHEN NEGOTIATING WHERE TO LOCATE WITHIN THE STATE. THAT RESULTS-IN A RIGGED PROCESS DRIVING CITIES TO ACCEPT INCREASINGLY ONEROUS TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR ONLINE RETAILERS SENDING ALL THE SALES TAX THEY COLLECT IN CALIFORNIA. TO THAT SINGLE JURISDICTION. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH REVENUE THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ARE SIPHONING FROM THEIR CITY AND IT'S ESTIMATED TO BE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR THESE REASONS SB SEVEN NINETY TWO WOULD REQUIRE RETAILERS TO REPORT THE DESTINATION DATA FOR ALL TAXABLE SALES TRANSACTED ONLINE. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AS WELL AS CITIES ACROSS THE STATE THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THOSE EXISTING AGREEMENTS. NOW OR IN THE FUTURE THAT SIMPLY LETS GET TRANSPARENCY ON THE DATA SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE REAL IMPACTS OF- THE BRADLEY BURNS- SCHEME THAT IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE TODAY WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A- THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BORDERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHOR- HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR SOME TIME OR VARIATIONS OF IT YOU KNOW POINT OF ENTRY POINT OF SALE AND HE'S A HE'S A HE'S VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE I'VE HAD OCCASION TO CHAT WITH HIM ON THIS I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY NINETEEN- THERE'S A SIMILAR ISSUE. FROM MY STANDPOINT IS REPRESENTED THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE LACK THE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY THAT A LOT OF PLACES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE. WERE PREDOMINANTLY IN AGRICULTURE WE HAVE- MEDICAL SERVICES- BUT LARGELY IT'S A SERVICE INDUSTRY SO WHEN WE USE OUR GEOGRAPHY TOWARD VANTAGE TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO HAVE THESE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN THE SPINE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT FOLKS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE ABOUT THIS IS THAT SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE CITIES. LEVERAGE THEIR GENERAL FUND IN THEIR TAX BASE TO OFFER INCENTIVES FOR. AMAZON OR- IN A KIA OTHER MAJOR OUTLETS TO COME TO THEIR AREA TO PROVIDE OBS. LARGELY OUT OF NECESSITY BUT ALSO OF COURSE YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO COME TO THE VALLEY BECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY AND IT'S- TRANSPORTATION HUB. SO ONE OF THE CONCERNS AND THAT I WOULD- THROW TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE SENATE IS THAT NOT EVERY COMMUNITY. HAS THE SAME SET OF OPPORTUNITIES AND WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WHERE. IT DISALLOWS A DISTRIBUTION CENTER OR SOME OTHER ENTITY THAT IS SIMILARLY SITUATED FROM NEGOTIATING WITH THE CITY AND THE CITY EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO- TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE DOLLARS. IT CREATES FURTHER INEQUITY IN AN AREA THAT NEEDS ITS ADVANTAGES SO I WOULD I RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THIS TO MY FRIEND- IN TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE. THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS- YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE WHAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS LIKE YOU KNOW THE TWELVE COUNTIES- UP AND DOWN THE SPINE OF CALIFORNIA IN FOR TALKING ABOUT. EMPOWERING THE REGION AND. LOOKING AT FOLKS. THAT NEED TO DIVERSE ECONOMICALLY. DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND TRANSPORTATION HUBS ON IS ONE OF THE REASONS IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS. HOW WE CAN ATTRACT TALENT TO OUR TO OUR COMMUNITIES SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DECLINED TO SUPPORT THIS. BUT I FULLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS. THANK YOU SENATOR OFF. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I WILL I'M GOING TO JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM FRESNO. IN HIS COMMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S FURTHER INLAND PARTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. HAVE BEEN UNDERSERVED AND DISADVANTAGED FOR DECADES AND DECADES FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS. AND WHEN WE USE OUR GEOGRAPHY IS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO. REFERS TO IT TO BENEFIT. OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES FRANKLY AND TO BENEFIT THOSE WHO PURCHASE FROM THE CONVENIENCE OF THEIR HOMES IN THEIR OFFICES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. USING THESE- FACILITIES IN OUR GEOGRAPHY WE ENCOURAGE CERTAIN BURDENS. IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS IN SOME CASES THAT ARE ALMOST OVERWHELMING IN THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS IN THESE BURDENS NEED TO BE OVERCOME AND FRANKLY SALES TAX REVENUE HELPS US DO JUST THAT SO. FOR THIS BILL FOR THIS DAY I UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO THIS MEASURE SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I'M BEING I ALSO OFFER A QUESTION PLEASE. SENATOR GORE DO YOU ACCEPT QUESTION ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU HOW DOES THIS BILL DIFFER DIFFER FROM YOUR FIVE THIRTY ONE THAT THE GOVERNOR VETOED. THANK YOU SENATOR- THE PREVIOUS BILL THAT YOU MENTIONED WOULD HAVE BANNED ANY FUTURE DEALS GOING FORWARD- TO TAKE PUBLIC MONEY AND GO **** THE SIGHTING OF- WHERE THAT INTERNET TRANSACTION MAY HAVE OCCURRED. IT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED ANY NEW DEALS THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY SILENT ON EXISTING DEALS AND ANY FUTURE DEALS IT DOESN'T SPEAK TO ANY AGREEMENT THAT A CITY OR COUNTY COULD. UNDERTAKE GOING FORWARD THIS BILL ONLY DEALS WITH DATA THE RELEASE OF DATA WHERE TAXES BEING COLLECTED IN THE STATE. AND THAT'S IT IT IS COMPLETELY SILENT ON ANY OF THESE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS OR FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH IS WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE BILL YOU MENTIONED VERY GOOD THANK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION IF I MAY. IT'S AS THE SENATOR WHO REPRESENTS MORE OF A DISTRICT WITH MORE WAREHOUSES ANY PLACE ELSE IN THE STATE OR THE COUNTRY. THIS YOUR CURRENT BILL WOULD NOT TAKE AWAY THE SALES TAX THAT WE ARE RECEIVING IN THOSE CITIES AND ALLOCATED TO THE CITIES WHERE THE ITEMS ARE PURCHASE LET'S SAY YOU KNOW. WE HAVE. A PLETHORA OF WAREHOUSES WILL JUST USE AMAZON AS AN EXAMPLE AND I PURCHASED AN ITEM FROM AMAZON AND I LIVE IN HILLSBORO. WITH THE SALES TAX GO TO HILLSBOROUGH OR WOULD IT STAY IN MY DISTRICT. THE BILL IS COMPLETELY SILENT ON ANY CHANGES ANY EXISTING IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT A CITY OR A CITY AND COUNTY HAS NEGOTIATED WITH ANY PRIVATE COMPANY. THAT WOULDN'T AFFECT ANY THERE WOULD BE NO EFFECT- IN EXAMPLE THAT YOU HAVE CITED THIS IS ONLY A DATA- DISCLOSURE BILL NOT AFFECTING THOSE EXISTING DEALS OR ANY FUTURE DEALS OKAY SO JUST COLLECTS DATA. AND IF I WANTED TO RENEGOTIATE IF AMAZON WANTED TO RENEGOTIATE WITH SOMEONE COULD YOUR WHAT YOUR BILL ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT AND THEN ALLOW THE SALES TAX TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE YES IT DOESN'T AFFECT ANY ANY FUTURE DEAL THAT MIGHT BE NEGOTIATED. PLEASE SILENT ON THIS BILL THIS BILL SAYS THERE'S A DISPUTE ABOUT WHO ARE THE WINNERS AND LOSERS UNDER THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS. AND SO THIS BILL WOULD SAY RELEASE THE DATA ON SALES TAX COLLECTION SO THESE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE FACTUAL. ISSUES SO THERE COULD BE DISAGREEMENTS ON FUTURE BILLS OR NOT BUT AT LEAST THAT THE DATA WOULD BE RELEASED BUT IT WOULDN'T AFFECT ANY FUTURE ARRANGEMENT AS YOU SO INDICATE. OKAY I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION AND- I'M A LITTLE LEERY I THINK I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY AND IF IT GETS OFF THE FLOOR COMES BACK TO US I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. THAT THANK YOU FOR HELPING WITH THE ANSWERS. THANK YOU. SENATOR ROB. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR SERVER LOCATION WERE YOU TRIP TO QUESTION AT YES- THE JUROR THANK YOU- CENTER I THINK WE KNOW FROM YOUR PRIOR EFFORTS YOUR VIEW ON WINNERS AND LOSERS ON THIS PARTICULAR SUBJECT BUT TYPICALLY WE DO NOT DO BILLS WITHOUT AN OBJECTIVE IN MIND SO. WHAT IS YOUR OBJECTIVE WITH RESPECT TO. THIS DATA ONCE IT IS DISCLOSED CLEARLY. WE KNOW WHICH CITIES COLLECT SALES TAX SALES AND USE TAX AND- IN THE AMOUNTS THAT THOSE. ITEMS ARE COLLECTED THIS IS VERY PARTICULAR EYES STATUS SO. WHAT IS YOUR GOAL WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THIS DATA. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. DURING PREVIOUS DEBATES IN THIS SUBJECT AREA THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF- OF A- DISPUTE AS TO REALLY THE IMPACT OF THESE BRADLEY BURNS AGREEMENTS WHETHER THEY'RE UP AT ANY IMPACT AT ANY SCALE TO BE ABOUT SUCH GREAT CONCERN OR NOT. AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN DISPUTES AS TO WHO GAINS AND WHO LOSES WE HEARD FROM THE SENATOR. FROM FRESNO A MOMENT AGO WE TALKED ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE IN HIS CITY BUT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON NEIGHBORING CITIES AROUND FRESNO AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE EFFECTS. OF THAT BRADLEY BURNS- TAX SITE PUTTING OFF OR NOT THAT MAY BE IN EFFECT SO. IT'S REALLY TRYING TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEBATE GOING FORWARD IN THE SENATE IN THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE GOVERNOR AT LEAST WE CAN HAVE THE DEBATE WITH THE FACTS BEING CLEARLY NOW. WE COLLECT SALES TAX DATA BUT IT'S NOT SEGMENTED IN A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE TRUTH BE TOLD ON WHO ARE THE WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE STATE. IF ANY. THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME AS PRESIDENT ONE MORE TIME YOUR OWN TIME. YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS IT'S ONE SIDED DATA. THE DATA IS NOT COLLECTED IS THE IMPACT ON THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE COST TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THE COST OF ROAD REPAIR. COSTS TO A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS THAT WERE HOUSING BRINGS TO OUR COMMUNITIES MANY OF THEM DISADVANTAGED AND SO THE TITLE YOU WILL COLLECT WILL BE SALES AND USE TAX. TAX DATA ON THE IDENTITY OF PURCHASERS. BUT IT DOES NOT REFER TO COLLECT DATA ON THE IMPACT OF THE PURCHASERS. THE PURCHASING THE IMPACT OF THE WAREHOUSING. THAT RESULTS IN THE PURCHASE IS BEING MADE ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THESE DISADVANTAGED AREAS. AND IT'S ONE SIDED SO I HOPE IN ANY FUTURE EFFORTS THAT YOU ENGAGE IN I HOPE THE AUTHOR. TAKES THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND PERHAPS WE SHOULD COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA. ON THOSE- THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE IMPACT ON THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FOR RESPONDING TO MY QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD BE AS CONTROVERSIAL AS IT IS BECAUSE- IT IS A BILL SEEKING MORE DATA. AND ACCORDING THE I. R. S. AT A FEDERAL LEVEL WE LOSE ONE TRILLION DOLLARS IN UNCOLLECTED TAXES EACH YEAR EACH YEAR. AND THIS PLAYS OUT AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS WELL. AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE STRONG ECONOMIES IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICTS AND THAT IS AN IMPERATIVE FOR ALL OF US. WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE IS GET RID OF TAX ARBITRAGE. AND MORE DATA IS HELPFUL THAT WE CAN'T MAKE GOOD POLICY WE CAN'T MAKE GOOD TAX POLICY WE CAN HAVE GOOD TAX ENFORCEMENT. UNLESS WE HAVE THAT DATA AND SO TO ME THIS IS A NO BRAINER. THAT WE SHOULD BE SEEKING MORE DATA TO BETTER INFORM OUR DECISIONS TO BETTER INFORM ABILITY TO COLLECT TAXES. THAT CITIES AND JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWFULLY PASSED SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTERED ALL OVER YOUR BACK ADDRESS. THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME MR OUR PRESIDENT I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE SAID ABOUT THE DATA THAT WE'RE GOING TO COLLECT IN THE DATA THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO COLLECT I WOULD JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE WHEN AMAZON OPENED IN SAMBAR DINO. WITHIN FIVE YEARS THE ROADS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED FROM ALL THE TRAFFIC GOING IN AND OUT NOT JUST THE TRUCKS BUT FRANKLY PEOPLE COMING NTO WORK EVERY DAY THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THE CITY OF SAMBAR DINO HAD TO CUT THEIR BUDGET. TO NON PROFITS BY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE YEAR WAS ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO HAD TO CUT THE BUDGET OF THEIR NONPROFIT SO MAYBE GIVE THE NONPROFIT TURNING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY HAD TO REPAIR THE ROADS THE DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE. SO I JUST THINK THAT THE POINTS THAT THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE MAKES FOR INCREDIBLY VALID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING ALL THE DATA. IS THIS IS ABOUT TAXES AND MAKING SURE THEY GO TO THE RIGHT PLACE I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU HAVE THESE WAREHOUSES IN YOUR DISTRICT IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD ALL THE TAXES SHOULD STAY THERE BECAUSE YOU WERE THE ONES PAYING THE PRICE YOU HAVE THE AIR POLLUTION YOU HAVE THE TRAFFIC YOU HAVE THE TRUCKS YOU HAVE THE NOISE. YOU HAVE IT TEARING UP YOUR CITIES SO THE TAX BASE SHOULD STAY THERE SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING DATA BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE GET ALL THE DATA SO WE CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL. DESCRIPTIONS ARE BASED CENTER FOR INTERNAL. YEAH THIS IS JUST KIND. A FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND MAYOR- WHEN WE LOOK TO ATTRACT BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITY- FOR DEVELOPERS WHATEVER WE OFTEN NEGOTIATE WITH THOSE DEVELOPERS AND BUSINESSES. ON CREATING IMPROVEMENTS AND WE LOOK. DISCERNING AT WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE TO OUR ROADS ARE INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER WE HAVE TO MOVE A FIRE HYDRANT WHATEVER IT IS. AND WE TIE THAT INTO THE DISCUSSION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. BY THOSE DEVELOPMENTS AND SO. YOU KNOW PART OF THE OWNER SHOULD BE ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. WHEN THEY NEGOTIATE THOSE DEALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LOOK OUT FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND CLEARLY THE ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IS IMPORTANT SO. JUST A POINT ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE. THANK YOU. SENATOR GROVE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I AGREED WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM TINO AS- KERN COUNTY HAS A THE SAME THING THAT THEY HAVEN'T SAMBAR DINO LAND LAND OF THAT- NEEDS TO BE USED FOR EITHER SOLAR PROJECT- DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR PLACES WHERE- THESE FACILITIES THAT ARE NEGOTIATED BY AGAIN UNLIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE AND- THE CHAIR OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SAID A LOCAL GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATES THEM BUT THERE'S ALSO THINGS LIKE TAX INCENTIVES- I KNOW THAT THE FACILITY THAT AMAZON LOCATED IN KERN COUNTY JUST ACROSS FROM THE AIRPORT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY. AS A DISTRIBUTION CENTER- WAS IN YOU KNOW EXCUSED OR- DIDN'T. HAVE TO PAY TAXES FOR A CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME IN ORDER TO MOVE THAT FACILITY THERE. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN A CASINO THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW WE DO WE HAVE THE ERROR MITIGATION ISSUES WE HAVE THE- TRAFFIC ISSUES WE HAVE- A LOT OF ISSUES THAT COME WITH MAKING SURE THESE FACILITIES HAVE LAND TO OPERATE IN. AND MY CONCERN IS THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR TO BE ABLE TO GATHER THIS DATA THE DATA IS GOOD AND TRANSPARENT. BUT THEN DO YOU pKERN COUNTY ONLY 3% OF THE PURCHASE IS ACTUALLY GO THERE AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY COMING FROM LOS ANGELES SO THEREFORE THE TAX REVENUE SHOULD GO TO. LOS ANGELES COUNTY OR SOME OTHER COUNTY. THE CONCERN I HAVE THERE AS WELL AS A SET KERN COUNTY BEING SUCH A LARGE LAND MASS AREA WHERE WE HAVE OPEN LAND LIKE MY COLLEAGUE IN SAMBAR DINO. AND WE'RE WE SHARE THAT COUNTY- FOR INSTANCE LIKE THE SOLAR PROJECTS THAT I MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE HAVE 51% OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND THAT HELPS MEET THE CLIMATE GOALS THE STATUS PUT FORTH IN KERN COUNTY BUT WE GET NO TAX BENEFIT FROM IT. SO WE CAN'T HIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT FIXER LIBRARY STICKS ARE SWIMMING POOLS. DO THE WATER PARK THINGS FOR OUR KIDS BECAUSE WE DON'T COLLECT TAX REVENUE. AND IF THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR IS TO REMOVE- THE TAX COLLECTION REVENUE THAT WE GET FOR THE PURCHASERS THAT PURCHASE FROM OUR DISTRICT. WHERE THESE FACILITIES ARE AT. AND I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE IT'S- IT IS DEVASTATING FOR US AS A COMMUNITY. AGAIN IN DECEMBER TO DINO IN KERN COUNTY AREA EVEN IN TELERI COUNTY. WHERE YOU HAVE. THE FACILITIES THAT ARE LOCATED THERE BUT WE GET NO BENEFIT FROM IT. IF THIS BILL- IS THE INTENT TO LEAD TO THE BILL THAT WOULD THAT DIED LAST YEAR. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK- FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU IN ADDITION TO SENATOR DALLAS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- WELL I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE GOING TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD BUT I'M GLAD WE ARE SO MOST OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TODAY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THE IMPACTS OF THE COMMUNITY WHAT DO YOU HAVE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND I UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS COMING ON A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHEN WE FOUGHT OVER SALES TAX. ON EVERY TURN WITH BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY'S. WHEN WE COME FROM A DISTRICT WHERE YOU HAVE VERY WIDE OPEN SPACES AND VERY FEW PEOPLE IN MOST PARTS OF MY DISTRICT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY COMMUNITIES SURVIVE ON A SALES TAX AND THEN. WE'VE SEEN A TREND NOW WE HAVE THE AMAZONS OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE THE COSCO'S AND WE HAVE THESE. THE ABILITY TO. DISTRIBUTE OW WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE WE USED TO GO TO THAT STORE BY THE ITEMS THAT WERE THERE THE SALES TAX WAS COLLECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THAT HELP PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR STREETS FOR. ALL THE THINGS THAT THAT THEY PROVIDE. AND NOW WE SEE THESE BIG DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LIKE AMAZON AND THE OTHERS THAT ARE LOCATED IN ONE AREA THAT SELLS TAX GOES TO THAT ONE AREA SO MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS- WILL THIS STUDY. TAKING A COW SOME OF THOSE LOST REVENUES FROM THE TRENDS OF CHANGING TO. THE DISTRIBUTION WAY THAT WE'RE DOING BUSINESS. CENTERED LARGELY STREET. ADDRESS OF COURSE ANYONE YET IN YOUR CLOTHES WELL I JUST LIKE TO HEAR IT A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY AGAIN IF I COULD FROM THE GOOD SENATOR MY QUESTION IS THAT YOU'RE- YOU'RE TRYING TO. RETAIN DATA AND MOST OF HOWEVER TODAY'S PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY FOR THEIR BIG FOR THEIR DISTRIBUTION CENTER. BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE SALES TAX HAS BEEN LOST TO THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAD A STORY FOR THE MERCHANDISE WAS WAS GOING TO THE STORE YOU COLLECT THE TAX AT THE STORE AND THAT HELP SUPPORT. THE SALT SMALL GREASE IS THAT INCLUDED IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE FOCUS THANK YOU GET A GOOD SENATOR THE FOCUS ON THIS BILL IS- AT THE YOU KNOW WE COLLECT THE SALES TAX DATA. BUT IT'S NOT COLLATED IT'S NOT SEGMENTED IN A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN UNDERSTAND. HOW THE BRADLEY BURNS TAX. AFFECTS WHERE WHERE THE MONEY IS END UP GOING. ON VERSES WHERE THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE THE ORDERS FROM SELF I THINK IT WILL AND WHAT I THINK IT WILL TO SOME DEGREE WILL ENLIGHTEN THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING- I CAN'T BE EXACTLY SURE THAT IT WILL BUT- IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO TAKE THAT EXISTING TAX DATA THAT WE COLLECT. AND MAKING SURE WE CANNOT IDENTIFY THE CITY IN WHICH- THE FOLKS- ORDERED IT. FOR COLLECTED IT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DISCERN THE BILL AGAIN IT DOESN'T AFFECT ANY OF THE ANY EXISTING. AGREEMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE. BUT IT IS TRYING TO CREATE GREATER TRANSPARENCY ON THAT- TAX. CONSEQUENCES TO THE BENEFIT. OR DISADVANTAGE OF THAT OF ALL OF US. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. IN ADDITION THE SCRIPTURAL GREAT SCENE NINE- GLACIER WHICH A LOT CLOSER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YOU KNOW I LOVE THE SPIRITED DEBATE IN THIS SUBJECT AREA AND THIS IS MY- THIRD TIME WITH ENGAGING IN IT AS AN AUTHOR OF A BILL THAT TOUCH A TOUCH THIS AREA AND IT'S A IT TOUCHES IT IT'S A SENSITIVE POINT BECAUSE- WHAT'S BECOME CLEAR WITHOUT REAL DATA TO RELY UPON IT CLEAR TO ME AT LEAST IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN WINNERS AND LOSERS. IN THE TAX GAMES CALLED BRADLEY BURNS AND WHERE IT'S DESIGNATED AS COLLECTED AND- AND IT'S ALLOWED SOME OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD TO MANIPULATE OUR TAX CODE NOW WE MAY DISAGREE OR AGREE ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THAT. AND WE'VE HAD SOME SPIRITED DEBATES FROM MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THOSE WHO FEEL THAT THAT THOSE THOSE ARRANGEMENTS WORK TO THEIR ADVANTAGE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND SO I'M ASKING IN THIS BILL BY THE WAY IS POLICE HAVE THE DATA SO WE CAN HAVE A MORE THOROUGH CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD IF THERE'S ANY PROPOSAL. TO CHANGE IT. I WANT TO KNOW ONE LAST THING WHICH IS THAT. WHEN COMMUNITIES NEGOTIATE WITH THESE COMPANIES. THEY'RE NOT NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR MONEY. THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH OUR MONEY THE PUBLIC'S MONEY AND WHEN THEY AGREED TO GIVE MONEY BACK TO THESE CORPORATIONS THAT THEY'RE GIVING BACK OUR MONEY. AND SO IF YOU'RE ORDERING FROM THE INTERNET. FROM LOS ANGELES PARTS OF THE BAY AREA MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S YOUR MONEY THAT'S BEING NEGOTIATED NOT. NOT YOUR COMMUNITIES BUT LET'S AT LEAST GET THE DATA OUT THERE. I THINK WE'LL ALL BENEFIT FROM IT WILL HAVE MORE THE SPIRITED DEBATE I FEEL LIKE IT'S BEEN A GREAT BIPARTISAN DEBATE WHICH IS ESPECIALLY NICE BUT LET'S DO IT WITH A BETTER FACTUAL BASIS THAN WE HAVE TODAY WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN I WROTE.

FIVE TWENTY SEVEN KNOWS FOR THE MEASURE PASSES NOW WE'RE MOVING TO FILE ITEM SEVENTY FIVES SENATOR. ARE YOU STILL AT BACK MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE SENATE BILL EIGHT OH FOUR BY SENATOR GLAZER AN ACT RELATING TO RESOURCE CONSERVATION CENTER GLITTER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT A- A SIMPLER AND PERHAPS A- MORE EMBRACING MEASURE TO REPRESENT YOU THIS WOULD THAT SB EIGHT OH FOUR WOULD CREATE A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTER TO TRAIN FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. IN FORESTRY IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE AN ESTIMATED FOUR POINT THREE MILLION ACRES BURNED DUE TO WILDFIRE. THESE FIRES DAMAGED OVER TEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES BECAUSE THIRTY THREE FATALITIES. THIS COMES AFTER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE SEASONS THAT WERE THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE IN STATE HISTORY. WITH COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. THE CENTER WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF EXPANDING THE WORKFORCE AND IMPLEMENTING A VEGETATION FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PLAN- THIS PROGRAM WOULD NOT ONLY WORK TOWARDS REDUCING THE TOLL OF WILDFIRES- BUT IT WOULD DIE. CREATE A PATHWAY TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLETED CONFINEMENT IN JAILS AND STATE INSTITUTIONS THEREBY REDUCING RECIDIVISM RATES WHICH THAT WE KNOW ARE IMPORTANT THAT WE DO. I WANT TO A CLOSING JUST THANK MY CO AUTHORS THE CENTERS FROM MENLO PARK FROM SALINAS FROM SAN DIEGO FROM HEALDSBURG BERKELEY AND SAN FRANCISCO. I WANT TO PARTICULARLY THANK THE PRO TEM. AND THE CULTURES OF OUR WILDFIRE SENATE PACKAGE THE SENATORS FROM HEALDSBURG IN BALDWIN PARK FOR THEIR WORK WITH ME ON THIS LEGISLATION. AND THEIR INCLUSION OF IT IN THE SENATE WILDFIRE. PACKAGE WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL. THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR OF YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND- SB EIGHT OH FOUR. IT YOU KNOW AND A LOT OF US ARE AWAY FROM OUR FAMILIES AND I RE I REMEMBER A TEXT I GOT FROM MY HUSBAND IT SAYS HEADED TO THE RANCH- THERE'S A FIRE. AND THEN ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER HE SAID THE RANCH IS ON FIRE. AND SO AFTER I LEFT HER IMMEDIATELY WENT THERE IN TO SEE- AS SEVEN GENERATIONS AND FAMILY RANCH JUST UP IN FLAMES WAS A HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE BUT AGAIN ALL THE WILDFIRES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE'RE JUST AWFUL THIS PAST YEAR. AND I WENT DOWN AND TO THE ROAD IT'S ABOUT A MILE AND HALF OFF THE ROAD TO THE RANCH AND THERE WERE FIRE CREWS- THAT WITHIN BECOME THE INMATE CREWS. IN THESE INDIVIDUALS WORKED ALL NIGHT- ON SET WITH FULL GEAR I MEAN SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE WHEN A HUNDRED TEN POUNDS CARRYING A HUNDRED POUNDS OF WEIGHT. AND WORKING ALL NIGHT LONG TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIRE DIDN'T SPREAD ANY FURTHER AND THEN A LOUD AND THEY WORKED REALLY REALLY HARD AND SO TO ALLOW THEM SOME TYPE OF BENEFIT. TO GETTING GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AFTER THEIR TIME IN THE WILDFIRE SECTION AS AN INMATE IS JUST ADMIRABLE AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR IT BECAUSE I THINK THE BEST. SOLUTION TO- COMBATING RECIDIVISM AND PEOPLE RETURNING TO PRISON IS A JOB. THAT BENEFITS THEM AND THEIR FAMILY. DID THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ENGINE NINE CIRCLES WHICH ARE CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT WANT TO THANK THE GOOD SENATOR. FROM BAKERSFIELD HER KIND REMARKS THIS IS A WIN WIN FOR ALL THAT THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO US THESE DAYS- PROTECTING OUR FORESTS FROM FIRE- HELPING THOSE WHO I NEED OUR HELP. HI EIGHT METERS IN AN EFFORT THAT MEMBERSTHAT UNDERTOOK. THAT THEY CREATED A SIMILAR-CENTER FOR FIRE IN VENTURA COUNTY THIS WOULD GET NORTHERN CALIFORNIA A SIMILAR OPPORTUNITY IN THE AREA FORCE MAAGEMENT WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU MEMBERS THIS IS A CANDIDATE FOR UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL IS OR ANY OBJECTION FOR USE IN A UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL ON THIS MEASURE. HEARING TEAM NINE OZ THIRTY EIGHT NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES. NOW MEMBERS ARE GONNA MOVE BACK TO FALL ITEM THIRTY SEVEN. FALL ITEM THIRTY SEVEN BY SENATOR GONZALO SHE IS PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY. YOU MAY READ. SENATE BILL FOUR BY SENATOR GONZALEZ AN ACT RELATING TO COMMUNICATIONS AND DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. CONSULT THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT ONE OF MY FAVORITE BILLS SENATE BILL FOUR WHICH IS A CRITICAL MEASURING CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ACROSS THE STATE IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF HOW THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AS PREVENTING CALIFORNIANS FROM ENGAGING IN CRITICAL DIGITAL ACTIVITIES. WHETHER IT'S A STUDENTS HAVING TO GO TO TACO BELL TO GET A WIFI CONNECTION OR OLDER CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE FAST EOUGH INTERNET WE ALL KNOW THE STORIES THE BILL WILL REDEFINE THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA ADVANCE SERVICES FUND TO ENABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. TO BE BUILT IN UNSERVED AREAS THIS CHANGING CRITERIA WILL HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AN INTERNET SURPRISE SERVICE PROVIDERS OF ALL SIZES FOR TO APPLY FOR GRANTS. AT THE SAME TIME INVEST IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'LL ALSO STABILIZE THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE ADVANCE SERVICES FUND BY EXTENDING THE SUNSET ON THE PROGRAM AND SURCHARGE FOR AN ADDITIONAL TEN YEARS WELL CAPPING THE FORMER PERCENTAGE BASE FEE TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THIS IS A FORMULA. SIMILAR TO OUR EXISTING NINE ONE ONE SURCHARGE THE BILL WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL PART FUNDING GRANTS TO UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO BUILD HIGH SPEED FIBRE BROADBAND NETWORKS AT MINIMUM SPEEDS. OF ONE HUNDRED MEGABYTES DOWNLOAD AND TWENTY MEGABYTES PER SECOND UPLOAD- IT HAS A DIVORCE DIVERSE COALITION OF SUPPORTERS OF OVER ONE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EDUCATION ADVOCATES LABOR UNIONS SMALL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS IN SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. THAT NEED OUR SUPPORT THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BY BOAT N. AS BEFORE TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ONCE IN FROM CALIFORNIA THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTERED DOLLAR. THANK YOU. MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO RISE IN OPPOSITION AND WHEN I SAY THAT BECAUSE SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS A DISTRICT IT'S VERY RULE HAS BERRIES LITTLE BROADBAND AND HAVE SOMEBODY WHO HAS WORKED IN THIS AREA FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. THE PRESIDING OFFICER MISTER SENATOR BRADFORD HOW TO BUILD A FEW YEARS BACK TO PUT MONEY INTO GET BROADBAND TO INNER CITY HOUSING PROJECTS. NOT DELIVERED HE'S DOING ANOTHER BILL TO GET THAT TRY TO GET THAT DONE I WORKED ON A B. TWENTY SIX SIXTY FIVE. BUT SENATOR COPULAR- AND SME MEMBERS IN THE OTHER HOUSE WE GOT THAT DONE WE PUT THE MONEY THERE. VERY LITTLE THAT MONEY'S GOT TO THE GROUND OR IT'S BEEN SPENT AND WE DON'T GET THE SERVICES THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. IT'S NOT THAT IT REQUIRES THAT IT THAT IT IT DOES THE FUNNY PART OF IT IT DOES ALL THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO. EXCEPT FOR. FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA GET IT TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES. THIS HUGE PIECE THE C. P. U. C. IT IS NOT FUNCTIONING IN THE MANNER IT SHOULD. WE SHOULD HAVE TO RUN TEN BILLS OR EIGHT BILLS ARE SIX MILLS. OVER THE YEARS AND NOT GET THE SERVICES RESCUE FOR. IN IN OUR SUB TWO COMMITTEE ACT I WANT TO SHARE THAT TO. THE SENATOR FROM- HILLSBOROUGH. SHE SAID IT PERFECTLY THE UTILITIES ARE NOT GOING TO USE THIS THEY DON'T USE IT THERE'S BEEN ONE UTILITY THAT USED. THE PRODUCT THE FUNDS ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED TO USE IT DURING A TRANSITION. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO EEP PUTTING MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE SERVICES WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A WAY THAT SAYS. THE UTILITIES ARE GOING TO. USE THESE FUNDS AND WE WILL PAY FOR THOSE. CONSTITUENTS WHO DON'T HAVE SERVICE ARE ARE VERY LIMITED SERVICE. AND IN MANY CASES. IN MY AREA THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SERVICE AT ALL NO CELL SERVICE MANY OF YOU. ONE OR FORTY TWO OR A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND YOU UNDERSTOOD. WHAT WE'RE FACING. AND IF YOU'RE IN IT SO I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. BUT THE SENATOR FROM GARDENING HOUSE EXCEPT FOR HE ACTUALLY HAS CELL SERVICE IN HIS AREAS BUT HIS BUDDIES PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD IT IN MY AREA WE HAVE ZERO. AND UNTIL WE ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WITH THE CPUC AND UTILITIES THIS BILL WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP US OTHER THAN PUT A LOT OF MONEY IN THE POT. IT'LL GO TO NONPROFITS. THAT WE CAN'T EVEN TRACK THE FUNDING. TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING SO FOR THOSE REASONS I REGRETFULLY HAVE TO. OPPOSE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT. WE WANT SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED. OR DON'T HAVE IT BECAUSE THE TOPOGRAPHY AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE THERE THIS WILL NOT GET US THERE. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER THANK YOU SENATOR ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR BORDERS. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THOSE BILLS. WHERE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO- BUT THE ACUITY OF THE KNEE OF OUR NEEDS- IS SO STRONG. IN A PERFECT WORLD I BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE INVESTED IS USING ITS ONETIME UNEXPECTED REVENUE TO BE INVESTING IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE- I DON'T THINK IT'S VERY OFTEN THEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS WE CALL IT THAT OF THIS NATURE. AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC IS THE INEQUITY AND THE TECH DIVIDE ACROSS THE STATE. I REPRESENT- RURAL AREAS FOOTHILL AND MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES- KIDS COULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL GO TO CLASS- IN THE DISTANCE- FORMAT BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAD ALL OF US HAVE SOME EXAMPLE OF THIS. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE SHOULD BE USING THE FUNDING FORMAT HERE OR BE USING ANOTHER FUNDING FORMAT. I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE LEADER- DISCUSSION IF SOMEONE WISHES TO EXPLORE IT FURTHER BUT MAYBE A QUICK QUESTION OF. IS UNSERVED AREAS. MY QUESTION IS THAT BASED ON POPULATION IN THESE UNDERSERVED AREAS OR IS IT IN A MORE QUAL DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THE STATE AND WHAT TYPE OF- FORMAT CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT MIGHT BE SICK BECAUSE WE'VE CHECKED QUESTION YES I DO OKAY THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- IN FUN SERVED IS AN EQUAL- TERM SO NOT OVER GEOGRAPHIC GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AS WAS USED BEFORE OR IS CURRENTLY- BUT IF YOU ARE ON SERVICE COMPLETELY NO INTERNET. SERVICE WEATHER REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU'RE AT IN THE IN THE- STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND UNKNOWN HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF UNCERTAIN AND THAT'S WHERE SO IT IS IT HAS A NEXUS WITH POPULATION HERE IN YEARS ONE OF MY CONCERNS MAYBE YOU CAN ALLEVIATE THEM DIRECTS ONE NATION. IS THAT WE ALL HAVE UNDERPERFORMING COMMUNITIES IN OUR DISTRICT IF YOU HAVE A HIGHER DENSITY POPULATION IN THE SPECIFIC AREA AND YOU CAN SERVICE THOSE FOLKS MORE EASILY WILL THIS ORGANICALLY OR DELIBERATELY THOSE DOLLARS IN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT FLOW TO THAT AREA BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE SERVICING MORE PEOPLE ON A ON A POPULATION BASIS THAN YOU WOULD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SCENARIO WHERE- YOU. HAVE- LESS DENSITY. THROUGH THE- AT MR PRESIDENT TO YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND NO THIS IS WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE PROBLEM. IS THAT- THE UNSERVED AREAS ARE CURRENTLY NOT RECEIVING ANY FIBER INFRASTRUCTURE AND BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AS YOU ALL KNOW. AND SO THIS WOULD. BE ABLE TO. COMPLETELY BLOW THAT UP AND LOOK AT IT IN A WAY THAT WE CAN START SERVING THESE COMMUNITIES BY PROMOTING COMPETITION SO INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS OF ALL LEVELS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE. A DIRECT ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS AS WELL SO THIS CREATES A MORE EQUITABLE PROCESS I THINK IN AND- YOUR% POINT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EVERYONE SERVED- IF THERE AND SERVE THOSE ARE PRIORITY FIRST IN THE UNDERSERVED WHICH WE KNOW. EXIST IN LA COUNTY AS THEY EXIST IN CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE SIX ONE SPEEDS WE NEED TO BE AT LEAST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT THIS IS ASKING. FOR EVEN MORE AND IT'S A BIPARTISAN DISCUSSION IN THE FEDERAL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY WANT A HUNDRED A HUNDRED WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THREE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TO SUPPORT THIS- IBM I HEAR THE CENTER FROM BIEBER THE IN HIS COMMENTS I THINK WE'RE WELL TAKEN. OF WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING AT IT THAT'S THAT'S ALL I COULD THINK OF AND AS CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS WE MADE THIS A PRIORITY. TO KEEP INSISTING ON INSISTING ON BECAUSE ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS- THE PANDEMIC DIDN'T- CREATE A PROBLEM BUT IT SURE DID EXPOSE. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONGST OUR RESIDENTS INCLUDING AND ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN WHO COULDN'T WE'RE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP IN SCHOOL. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CONNECTIVITY BECAUSE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE SO. WE NEED TO AND WE WILL DO BETTER AS BEFORE IS A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS AND I THANK THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING SCENE NINE HOURS SENATOR DOLLAR. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SORRY I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE MORE THING BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I WANTED TO. SHARE SCENARIO WITH YOU. EIGHTEEN T. HAS A LINE THAT GOES ALL THE WAY. TO WASHINGTON UP TO FIVE AND ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACKS GOES RIGHT TO THE COMMUNITY OF DUNSMUIR. AND AM NOT SHASTA. THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE I CAN THROW A ROCK FROM THE TOWN TO THE RAILROAD TRACK BUT I DON'T GET TO ACCESS IT BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE NOT TO. WE TALK ABOUT. BUILT OUT AREAS. WE WANT TO EXTEND ON OF THOSE BUILT OR IS ALREADY BUT THEY'RE OWNED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES. AND THOSE PRIVATE COMPANIES CHOOSE NOT TO USE THESE FUNDS. TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES AND YOU TALK ABOUT. THE CO THE PANDEMIC AND A PERSONALLY HAPPENED TO ME IN MY IN MY OWN FAMILY RIGHT I HAD TO GET I I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE I HAVE A DISH. ON THE TOP OF MINE. SHOP AT MY PROPERTY WHERE I. PERFORMED THE COMES OFF OF THE WATER TOWER IN TOWN WHICH IS SEVEN MILES AWAY TO GET INTERNET SO MY KIDS CAN BARELY GET ON AND WORK. THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE'S A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE OUT ALREADY BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAP INTO IT SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE THESE FUNDS. AND WE HAVE TO BUILD AROUND THEM. WE DON'T GET THE TOP OFF OF WHAT'S ALREADY THERE AND EXTEND OUT THAT LAST MILE. OR THAT. DIDN'T MAKE THE MIDDLE MILE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT IT DOESN'T. USE EXISTING STRUCTURE WE HAVE TO BUILD ALL NEW ND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT. ONE LAST POINT. DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE WAS A FEDERAL. AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAME IN. AND IT DID THREE NINETY FIVE ALL THE WAY UP THE BACKSIDE OF THIS YEAR'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A TIME THERE'S ONE PERSON LOOKED UP TO IT. THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THESE TYPES OF LEGISLATION THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING EXPECTING A DIFFERENT OUTCOME WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME OUTCOME. UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE SAY HEY. WE WANT TO GET TO THAT PERSON THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE MILE AND LAST MILE. AND UTILITIES WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR BUT YOU GOTTA LOVE TOOK IN YOUR SYSTEM. AS IF WE HAD IF WE GO THE OTHER ROUTE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THERE. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO WHAT GOVERNMENT ALWAYS DOES WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE JUST KEEP THROWING MORE MONEY AT IT. BUT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY. SO YOU SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A PROBLEM MONEY IT'S A PROBLEM OF THE POLICY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS I WANT TO I WANT TO GIVE THE MONEY TO GO DO IT. BUT I KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE. AND WE NEED TO FIX IT WE NEED TO GO SIT DOWN THE TELCOS ESSAY. AND THE CPUC AND SAY. TELL US WHAT WE NEED TO GET THERE AND WE'LL FIND IT. BUT WE'RE DOING AT THE BACK WAY WE'RE GOING WE'RE GIVEN THE MONEY. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING WHAT WE DESERVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. I SEE NO MORE MMHM MIKED UP SENATOR GONZALES WHICH ARE TOO CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I JUST RESPECT ALL THE COMMENTS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD ESPECIALLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER I WAS HAPPY TO BE IN HIS. BACKYARD ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND SAW THE BROADBAND ISSUES MYSELF AND SPOKE TO MANY OF HIS CONSTITUENTS AS MINE I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES SO I THINK WE'RE SEEING THE ISSUE CLEARLY IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIES BUT IT'S ALL THE SAME YOU'RE EITHER UNSERVED OR UNDERSERVED YOU HAVE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT THE PAST TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE THIS IS A DIFFERENT MODEL AGAIN TO PROMOTE COMPETITION. TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE OPTIONS IN IT AND FINALLY INCREASE THE SPEEDS FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA FAMILY SO FOR THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

I BELIEVE SHE IS MADAM SECRETARY. PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FIFTY SIX BY SENATOR TORONTO AN ACT RELATING TO MEDICAL SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I'M HERE TO PRESENT A BILL THAT WILL INCLUDE SENIORS AGES SIXTY AND UP. IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM MEETING INCOME REQUIREMENTS REGARDLESS OF STATUS. THESE ARE CALIFORNIANS OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM MAKING LESS THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. BUT ARE CURRENTLY BARRED FROM ACCESSING THESE BASIC MEDICAL SERVICES SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR DOCUMENTATION STATUS. DESPITE THE TREMENDOUS ADVANCES TO REDUCE THE RATE OF UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS DOWN TO HISTORIC LOW SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT. SINCE A. B. A. C. H. THE UNINSURED RATES AMONG UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE EXCEEDINGLY HIGH. THEY ARE BARRED EVEN FROM PURCHASING HEALTHCARE ON THE EXCHANGE AND THEY HAVE THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH CARE. MORE THAN HALF OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE PART OF MIXED STATUS FAMILIES. A PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CAN TAKE THE CHILD A GRANDCHILD TO SEE THE DOCTOR WHEN THEY'RE SICK BUT THE PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CANNOT DO THE SAME FOR THEMSELVES. ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS HAVE LIVED IN THE U. S. FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. UNDER CURRENT LAW LOW INCOME ADULTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES EMERGENCIES BUT NOT. DOCTOR VISITS TO GET PREVENTATIVE CARE FOR CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA DIABETES OR HEART CONDITION. THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT- CAN BE TREATED. AND CANNIBAL IT HIGHER COSTS IN THE SYSTEM AND AVOID SUFFERING. THAT MEANS THEY RELY ON EMERGENCY ROOMS AND LAST RESORT CARE WHEN THEIR CONDITION ESCALATES TO A POINT OF CRISIS THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT. ONE DOCUMENT DOES CONTRIBUTE OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL AND STATE TAXES. TO FUND PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE YET THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM ACCESSING THE LIFESAVING SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT THEIR TAX MONIES HELP FUND. I'VE TALKED TO NUMEROUS MEN AND WOMEN WERE WORK SO HARD IN OUR STATE AND OUR MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH FOR ALL COALITION MEMBERS LIKE MR VARGAS A SEVENTY SIX YEAR OLD AFFECTED COMMUNITY MEMBER. WHO COLLECTS RECYCLABLES TO PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE TO SURVIVE. LET ALONE BE ABLE TO AFFORD ANY KIND OF HEALTH CARE.

QUITE COMFORTABLE BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS YEARS AGO. THE BILL THAT I HAVE S. B. TWO FOUR ONE PROVIDE SOME VERY SIMPLE. AND SMALL CHANGES TO COURTROOM PROCESS AND PROCEDURE AND PRE COURTROOM PROCESS AND PROCEDURE ONE IT.

HEARING TEAM NINE MINUTES THE ODDS SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I RISE TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL IN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAD- MUCH TESTIMONY FROM THE PUBLIC OF FROM TRIAL COURT EMPLOYEES CORE REPORTERS INTERPRETERS- TALKING ABOUT ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THEY HAVE BEEN HEARING UNDERSTANDING AND TRANSLATING WITNESS TESTIMONY REMOTELY DURING THE PANDEMIC- AND AGAIN THERE WERE MANY MANY- DIFFERENT- ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED RAISED- WE CAN'T TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT THERE ARE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN THE HALLS. OF OUR COURT ROOMS OF THE POOR PEOPLE FOR THE ELDERLY FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS AND MY CONCERN IS THAT THESE DISPARITIES WILL ONLY BE WORSE AND- BY THE TECHNOLOGY IF WE DON'T HAVE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE I HOPE THAT WE CAN TAKE THE TIME. TO SORT THESE OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE MAKING UP MORE LONG TERM AND PERMANENT DECISIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HERE IN CHINO AND CENTER OVER WHICH ARE CLOSE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT YET YES- COURT REPORTERS PLAYER A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE TRIAL PROCESS- THEY'RE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THE RECORD THAT THEY KEEP MAINTAINING TRANSCRIBE IS ACCURATE. THE LAWYERS ARE EVEN MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE TRIAL RECORD AS IS THE JUDGE. OF THIS BILL SIMPLY ALLOWS FOR SOME WITNESSES TO TESTIFY REMOTELY- IT SAVES LOTS OF MONEY SAVES LOTS OF TIME AND IT SAVES LOTS OF FOLKS WHO WOULD HAVE TO MISS WORK FOR EXAMPLE TO COME AND TESTIFY ABOUT A MINISTERIAL. ACT IT SAVES THEM THE LOST WAGES THAT THEY MIGHT INCUR IF THEY HAD TO COME TO COURT- IT ALSO SPEEDS UP THE PROCESS I UNDERSTAND THAT COURT REPORTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACTORS SEE THE RECORD. BUT THIS BILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THEY ARE PRESENT IN THE COURT ROOM THEY NEED NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ELIMINATED FROM THE PROCESS ENSURES THAT THEIR PRESENT THE COURT ROOM AND SHOULD THERE BE IN. A MOMENT WHEN NEITHER COUNCIL. OR THE JUDGE RECOGNIZES THE RECORDS NOT BEING KEPT ACCURATELY THEY CAN AS THEY HAVE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL RAISE THEIR HAND AND SAY YOUR HONOR I DIDN'T GET THAT. AND THEN THEY CAN GO BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT THE RECORD IS ACCURATE- THIS BILL HAS BEEN WHITTLED DOWN THERE'S A TWO YEAR SUNSET ON THE BILL- I AM CONFIDENT THAT.

SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS SENATE BILL FIVE TWENTY EIGHT CREATES A HEALTH CARE PORTAL THAT WILL ALLOW HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES TO ACCESS THE MEDICAL INFORMATION OF A CHILD IN FOSTER CARE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR FOUND THE CRITICAL MEDICAL RECORDS OF FOSTER YOUTH OFTEN HAVE ERRORS ARE INCOMPLETE OR ALTOGETHER UNAVAILABLE TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC GIVEN THE MANY FOSTER YOUTH THAT HAVE SEVERE DIAGNOSIS INCLUDING MULTIPLE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION. THE LACK OF MEDICAL HISTORY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR FOSTER YOUTH TO RECEIVE THE CONTINUITY OF HEALTH CARE THEY DESERVE. AND TRAITS CHALLENGES FOR FOSTER YOUTH TO RECEIVE PRESCRIPTION RENEWALS FOR THE MAKE IT MEDICATION AND THEY WERE ALREADY ON. THE SYSTEM DEVELOPED UNDER SP FIVE TWENTY EIGHT WILL HELP FURTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE. BEHIND EARLIER DIAGNOSIS AND PRESCRIPTIONS TO CONFIRM THEY ARE STILL ACCURATE AND NECESSARY. THIS BILL ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO EITHER CREATE A NEW SYSTEM OR ROLL IT INTO A NEW SYSTEM ALREADY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THESE VULNERABLE YOUTH GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED ANY WORKABLE MANNER MEMBERS I SINCERELY ASK YOUR I'LL VOTE ON SB FIVE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT.

SENATE BILL SIX FIFTY BY SENATOR STERN AN ACT RELATING TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. IN RETURN FOR GEORGE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS AT THE END OF LIFE SOME ARE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY LIVE IN NURSING HOMES- THIS MAY BE TRUE IN SOME OF YOUR FAMILY'S IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE IN MIND. UNFORTUNATELY LAST YEAR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS AUDITS AND OTHER REPORTS HAVE BEEN COVERED HOW FOR PROFIT NURSING HOMES ARE USING COMPLEX OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES. TO SIPHON UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNTS OF MONIES TO QUOTE UNQUOTE RELATED PARTIES. ALLOWING CORPORATE HOME OFFICES TO HIDE HEIR PROFITS. AND SUPPORT FACILITIES CLAIM FOR YET MORE PUBLIC FUNDING. IT SEEMS FROM THESE REPORTS IN A RECENT AUDIT DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR MANY OWNERS MANAGERS AND OPERATORS OF THOSE FACILITIES. MAY BE MORE INTERESTED IN THEIR BOTTOM LINE INVESTING IN QUALITY CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. COUPLES PUT ALL THIS INTO SHARP FOCUS- FOR THE COST OF LIVING AND WE'LL BE PROFITEERING GO UNEXAMINED UNCHECKED. IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY UTILIZES VARIOUS ENTITIES HOLDING COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT COMPANIES TO SUPPORT THEIR OVERALL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE OPTIONAL TITLE OF THE PROPERTY WHERE THE NURSING HOMES OPERATED. IN THE CONTRACT WITH CORPORATIONS THAT. THEY MAY BE OVER CHARGING FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL NURSING HOMES WITHIN A CORPORATE FAMILY. AND MOST OF THESE SERVICES ARE BEING PAID FOR AND SUBSIDIZED BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. THIS MAY BE EFFECTIVE SHIELDING REVENUE SO THEY ARE NOT FULLY CONSIDER WHEN STATE ASSESSES PART PROCREATE RATING REIMBURSEMENTS FOR CARE. AND THIS WOULD MEAN THE RATES PAID BY THE STATEMENT OVER BEEF WOULD BE OVERPAYING. WE'RE STILL THE INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES WITHIN THE CORPORATE ENTERPRISE WOULD HAVE LESS MONEY FOR ACTUAL OPERATIONS. FOR THEIR STAFF. THEIR WAGES SUPPLIES CENTER. ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR MEMBERS SPENT ON RELATED PARTY PAYMENTS. SO RATHER THAN TRY TO INTERVENE IN THE MARKETPLACE AND MICROMANAGE OUR NURSING HOME INDUSTRY. GOES ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS THIS BILL SIMPLY PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING NURSING HOMES TO FILE A CPA REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. GIVEN THE STATE AND THE PUBLIC MORE TRANSPARENCY ALSO REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF REVENUE. FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITY TO SUBMIT CERTAIN CONTRACTS AND FINALLY THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY MUST PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION OUTLINING THE ORGANIZATION'S STRUCTURE INCLUDING RELATED PARTY PARTIES AND THOSE RECEIVING REVENUES. OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. THIS IS BILL'S BEEN WORKED ON EXTENSIVELY WITH THEIR HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE CHAIR FOR HIS WORK AS WELL AS IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. TO MANAGE COSTS MAKE THIS WORKABLE FOR THE INDUSTRY AND HOPEFULLY GET CONSUMERS THE TRANSPARENCY THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED. AS WELL AS OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS WE OFTEN SAY THAT THEY SHOULD CARE MORE. BUT WE DON'T DO OUR PART IN TAKING CARE OF THEM. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY ACLU CALIFORNIA A. L. P. CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. THE WIDE RANGE OF ADVOCATES AND OTHER RIGHTS GROUPS WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE HEALTH FACILITIES AND PLAN TO DO SO. IF THIS BILL MOVES FOR THE ASSEMBLY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE.

THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT THE SENATE TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT SP SIX EIGHTY TWO ALSO KNOWN AS THE AND RICH INITIATIVE AND RACIAL INEQUITIES IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN COLLABORATION WITH RELEVANT AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS. AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A PLAN TO REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH OUTCOMES BY AT LEAST 50% BY TWENTY THIRTY. DATA CONTINUES TO SHOW CLEARLY DISPARITIES EXIST AND THAT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. IN NINETEEN IS A PRIME EXAMPLE AND WHERE THIS ISSUE WAS HIGHLIGHTED AND THE DISPARITIES COULDN'T BE MORE CLEAR. THEY HAD HIGHER RATIOS OF THE CASES OF CULPRIT HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS AMONG OUR LATINO BLACK ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER AND NATIVE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES APPROXIMATELY 25% OF ALL CHILDREN ALREADY EXPERIENCE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OVERALL IMPACTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE HOWEVER FAMILIES OF COLOR ARE TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MOST OF THESE CHRONIC. DISEASES IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE MOST COMMON CONDITIONS AMONG AMONG ARGUED OUR ASMAN DIABETES DEPRESSION DENTAL CARIES AND VAPING RELATED DISEASES THE STATE NEEDS TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN ITS APPROACH. TO TACKLE THE RACIAL HEALTH INEQUITIES AND MUST ESTABLISH CLEAR TARGETS AND STEPS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL ENSURING EQUITABLE AND TIMELY ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE MEASURES WILL LEAD TO BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND LEAD TO HEALTHIER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE ADULTS THAT THOSE CHILDREN. WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND HAS PASSED WITH UNANIMOUS UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT HOW COUNTIES ARE USING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS AND HOW THESE FUNDS ARE SERVING OUR CONSTITUENTS. MEMBERS WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR AND AN EFFORT TO HELP CALIFORNIANS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT WE HAVE PRECIOUS LITTLE DATA TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHICH OF THE PROGRAMS WE ARE FINDING OUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND WHICH OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY HELPING THE PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED THIS ASSISTANCE. THIS IS NOT JUST MY OPINION IT'S THE VIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. LAST SUMMER THE STATE AUDITOR RELEASED A REPORT DETAILING THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY FOR HOW MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE FUNDS ARE BEING USED. AND THE BENEFITS FROM THESE SERVICES. BASED ON THEIR RECOMMENDATION. THIS BILL CREATES A STATE FRAMEWORK FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION ON MENTAL HEALTH SPENDING AND OUTCOMES. THE THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COLLABORATE WITH STATE AND LOCAL MENTAL HALTH AGENCIES TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING PROGRAM FOR COUNTY SPENDING ON MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND THE OUTCOMES FOR FROM THAT SPENDING.

SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY FIVE BY SENATOR OCHO A BOGUS AN ACT RELATED TO TAXATION. SENATOR JOE BOWEN HELLO THANK YOU- MR PRESIDENT AS B. SIX SEVENTY FIVE WOULD SIMPLY GIVE COUNTIES THE OPTION TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO ALLOW TAXPAYERS FOR SIXTY TWO YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER OR WHO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME TO PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES IN A MONTHLY INSTALLMENT OF RATHER THAN INTO LUMP SUMS. THIS WOULD BE A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM FOR BOTH THE COUNTY AND THE TALK TAXPAYER. AS EXISTING LAW STANDS NOW PROPERTY TAXES ARE PAID INTO ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS EXCEPT IF AN OWNER IS IN DEFAULT. THE SYSTEM BECOMES A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WHEN HOMEOWNERS OWNED THE PROPERTY OUT RIGHT ARE NO LONGER PAYING MONTHLY MORTGAGES AND HAVE NO IMPOUND ACCOUNTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR TAXPAYERS WHO RELY ON FIXED INCOME SUCH AS THOSE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO. AND TAXPAYERS WHO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME FOR DISABILITY. SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE WILL ALLOW COUNTIES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON FIXED INCOMES TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL. OF THE TAX STEADILY. THIS BILL IS TIMELY GIVEN THE INCREASED NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO COUNTY THANKS TO THE RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. ONE SUCH OPTION IS A PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES FINANCE COMMITTEE CALLED EASY SMART PAY. IN COUNTIES THAT OFFER THE EASY SMARTPAY SOLUTION TAXPAYERS CAN CHOOSE TO CREATE AN EASY SMART PAY ACCOUNT AND PAY PROPERTY TAXES MONTHLY WITH A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD OR DIRECTLY FROM THE CHECKING ACCOUNT. THERE'S NO COST TO THE COUNTY AND NO NEED TO DEVELOP A NEW SYSTEM OR SOFTWARE. EASY SMART PAGAN INTEGRATES SEAMLESSLY WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS. EASY SMARTPAY HAS BEEN IN A PILOT PHASE FOR THREE YEARS BUT SEE SEX FINANCE COMMITTEE SAY THEY PLAN TO HAVE THIS PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO ALL COUNTIES IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THIS BILL PRESERVES LOCAL CONTROL BY ALLOWING COUNTIES TO CHOOSE WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM WHILE ALSO BUT FURTHERING CONSUMER CHOICE BY CREATING ADDITIONAL OPTIONS. THIS BILL HAS HAD. BIPARTISAN AND UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AND VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING AND SEEING ON THIS IS A CANDIDATE FOR UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL.

OR NOT TO USE TO REZONE- PORTIONS OR ALL OR WHATEVER THEY WANT OF THEIR CITY FOR SMALL MULTI UNIT BUILDINGS A CITY CAN DECIDE TO IGNORE THIS LAW AND IT WILL HAVE NO APPLICATION. IN THE CITY. THIS IS A BILL WE- PUT A LOT OF MANDATES ON CITIES AROUND HOUSING I HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE MANDATES THE MANDATES ARE OFTEN IMPORTANT- BUT THIS IS A BILL TO GIVE A TOOL THAT CITIES CAN USE. IF THEY ANT TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER IN ACHIEVING A GOAL- THAT WE ALL SHARE WHICH IS HOW MORE HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HI SPEED APPLY- ALLOW CITIES IN A STREAMLINED WAY TO ZONE FOR UP TO TEN UNIT BUILDINGS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TEN UNITS COULD BE TWO OR FOUR SIX. AFTER TIME. THIRTY CAN DO AN EXPEDITED STREAMLINED WAY- AS LONG AS IT'S IN A NON SPRAWL AREA AND IN PHILLY AREA. OR A TRANSIT RICH AREA CURRENCY LAW CAN MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. FOR CITIES TO A ZONE FOR SMALL MULTI UNIT BUILDINGS. EVEN IF IT IS IN A VERY ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE AREA. I SEE TIME AS A POWERFUL NEW TOOL FOR CITIES- IT WILL HELP CITIES. SIXTY AROUND HOUSING. AND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPO. THANK YOU SIR. WIENER ANY FURTHER THE- OR DEBATES ON THIS ITEM SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I'VE BEEN READING A LOT LATELY ABOUT THE SO CALLED ACCIDENTS OUT OF CALIFORNIA WHICH SUPPOSEDLY HAPPENED DURING THE PANDEMIC FROM THERE WASN'T THAT LARGE OF AN ACCIDENT IN FACT. HOWEVER THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT WAS CITED BY THOSE WHO LEFT INCLUDING THE BUSINESSES THAT LACK. WHAT'S NOT OUR TAXES. NO IT WAS THE COST OF HOUSING. THE END WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INTEREST STATE MOVING THOSE FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE LEFT. ARE EXTREMELY HIGH COST HOUSING AREAS. THOSE FOLKS HAVE ALSO MOVED. DUE TO THE COST OF HOUSING. THEY MOVED TO AREAS. TWO THREE HOURS AWAY FROM WHERE THEY WORKED BECAUSE THE COST OF HOUSING NOW WHY DO WE HAVE SUCH HIGH COST OF HOUSING. BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BUILT ENOUGH. BUT I WOULD MOST SUIT MYSELF JUST AS SOON NOT HAVE. TO BE- THAT HAPPENED UNDER THE STRICTURES OF SUPPLY SIDE ECONOMICS BUT IT'S A FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT PRODUCED THE DISPOSSESSED. THAT WE NEED AND UNTIL WE DO WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOWER THE COST OF HOUSING. THIS ONE IS AN EASY MEASURE IT DOESN'T FORCE ANY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO IT BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE WILLING. TO ADD A LITTLE MORE DENSITY WHERE THERE ALREADY IS HIGH NUMBERS OF JOBS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT SERVICES IT ALLOWS ME TO DO IT MORE EASILY AND. WITH THAT I ASKED FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SIR. SCANNERS ROOF. I TOLD HIM I. THINK IT WAS PRESIDENT AND I INTO OF THIS I IT JUST ONE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS BILL IS A SENATE- WORKING HOUSING WORKING GROUP PRIORITY AND I WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE THIS BILL. RE STARTED IN MY OPINION A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE AND HE WAS EXTREMELY GRACIOUS AND TAKING STAKEHOLDER EMPIRE. OPT FOR SOMEONE TO ADVOCATE FOR LOCAL CONTROL THIS IS REALLY A BALANCED MEASURE AS ALREADY STATED THIS IS A VOLUNTARY MEASURE THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN USE IF THEY CHOOSE TO. BUT IT'S NOT A MANDATE AND ONCE AGAIN A LOT THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS FLEXIBILITY AND RECONSIDERING THE INPUT OF MY DISTRICT AND ALL THOSE THAT WERE AT THE TABLE SO WITH THAT I ALSO URGE AND I WILL THANK YOU. THANK. YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME OF. QUESTION THE AUTHOR PLEASE- WE WERE YOU THE QUESTION FROM CENTER RIDGE. IF YOU WILL- HE WILL I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE BUYER RIGHT THAT COMES WITH A NUMBER OF THE HOUSING BILLS THAT WE'VE SEEN YEAH HI AND THANK YOU FOR THIS BEING PERMISSIVE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THEN BE ABLE TO. IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. ON HI. WORKING ALL OF THAT IT. THE THAT DENSIFICATION ABOUT AMOUNTS WOULD MAKE ON LET'S SAY RESIDENTIAL STREET. THANKS THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE CENTER- FROM- FROM- ORANGE FRIENDS AREN'T COUNTING ON. SO THE ANSWER IS THIS STILL DOES NOT CONSIST. ANY OTHER RULES ARE REQUIREMENTS THAT CITIES HOT THIS IS- FOR CITY COUNCIL MIGHT DECIDE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WE WANT TO ALLOW THREE UNIT BUILDINGS. AND THEY WOULD SET THE HEIGHT LIMIT THEY WOULD SET THE SET BACKS THEY WOULD SET THEIR IMPACT FEES THEY WOULD SET THEIR INCLUSIONARY THERE SET THEIR THEIR PARKING REQUIREMENTS THIS CALL DOESN'T CHANGE THEIR ABILITY TO SET ANY OF THAT. ALL THIS BUILD US. THEY SAY. USE IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO ZONE FOR THESE SMALL MULTI UNIT BUILDINGS IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO DO THAT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FASTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE. FOR YOU TO DO THAT. THIS IS A BENEFIT FOR CITIES AND IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY POWER AWAY FROM THEM. I DIDN'T THE BILL I DID NOTICE THAT. THE OBVIOUS DOES NOT ALLOW COMMUNITY INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS OR HOAS WITH CCN OURS TO. PREVENT ON THIS KIND OF DEVELOPMENT IN A PARTICULAR. OUR H. AWAY OR COMMUNITY INTEREST DEVELOPMENT IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S COMPARED TO THE S. B. NINE. THE PRESIDENT IS OUR FIFTH IS CONSIST WITH THE NUMBER OTHER HOW BILL- IT DOES NOT- EXAMS IT'S ALWAYS- CITIES ALREADY HAVE LATITUDE THESE ARE THE H. O. A.'S- AND THIS DOESN'T CHANGE OUT. THERE THE H. ALWAYS HAVE- THE TERROR ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ARE WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW ABOUT TECHNICAL LANGUAGE BECAUSE THEY RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN UNINTENDED. SIDE EFFECTS THAT WE DON'T INTEND- AND SO WERE ACTUALLY I THINK EVEN TODAY WAS OUR FIRST STAKEHOLDER MEETING WITH THEM TO TALK THROUGH THEIR ISSUES BECAUSE WE WANT TO WORK WITH THEM TO RESOLVE IT OBVIOUSLY THAT WON'T HAPPEN IN THE SENATE- BUT COMMITTED TO. SERVE REALLY FIGURING OUT HOW- TO COME TO A RESOLUTION WITH THEM. THANK YOU THAT SENATOR ON MY OWN TIME I GOING TO REMAIN A- IN WHOLE AS IT MAKES ITS WAY THROUGH ALL OF THE OTHER HOUSES SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE STILL VERY. CONCERNING TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND IN PARTICULAR TO NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACTS AND I WILL GIVE AN EXAMPLE. OF THE STREET THAT I LIVE ON IT'S A CUL DE SAC IN IT IT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO THE EXACT RIGHT AWAY TO ACCOMMODATE THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS ON THAT BLOCK SO PUBLIC SAFETY VIA VEHICLES. LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE ENGINES HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING DOWN THE STREET TURNING AROUND IN A CUL THE SAP DEVELOPMENT. WHEN THERE'S NO PARKING REQUIREMENTS WHICH WE HAVE. IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AS A MATTER OF FACT SO THE USERS SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED FRANKLY WITH MANY OF THE HOUSING BILLS. SO I REMAIN OPPOSED BUT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR CAN HELP THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING OF MANY OF THE- OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE OPPOSING THESE BILLS- THE SENATOR HAS ACCOMMODATED MANY OF THOSE CONCERNS BY MAKING THIS PERMISSIVE. ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE MORE SAY AND CONTINUES TO WORK ON IT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT I WILL REMAIN OPPOSED AT LEAST AT THIS JUNCTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MISS PRESIDENT MUST FIND THAT. LONG DAY I CALLING I RISE TO IN SOME OF SB TEN. AND I WOULD REALLY DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS- I HAD SOME CONCERNS INITIALLY BUT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND HOW IT APPLIES CERTAIN CITIES IN MY DISTRICT. I THINK OF LAGUNA BEACH A PLACE THAT HAS A ROBUST ECONOMY BUT NOT ENOUGH INFRASTRUCTURE OR- THROUGH WAYS TO REALLY SUPPORT A LOT OF INCREASED DENSITY AT THIS TIME. I APPRECIATE THE SENATOR FOR TAKING THE PERMISSIVE APPROACH AND ALLOWING SOME MEASURE OF LOCAL CONTROL. ON AND ALSO FOR PARTICULAR REMOVING THE JOB SERVICE PROVISION OF THIS BILL- WHICH ALLOWS FOR DISTRICTS LIKE MINE TO INCREASE DENSITY IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT. HARMFUL TO OUR CONCERNS. AS I SAID BEFORE THE HOUSING CRISIS IS JUST INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC RIGHT NOW. IT'S A MORAL CRISIS AND WE KNOW THAT THE TOP CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW IS A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS AN ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT IS BREWING I WANT TO SEE MYSELF WITH MY COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY- WE KNOW THAT THE TOP REASON THAT PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE STATE AND OR MOVING. IS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE OUR SENIORS CAN'T RETIRE WITH DIGNITY WORKING CLASS CALIFORNIANS. CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE STATE. WE NEED SOME MEASURE BEYOND JUST DELEGATING THIS TO OUR LOCALITIES- THIS IS THE TYPE OF MEASURE THE STICKS AND CARROTS THAT WE NEED TO START. IMPLEMENTING TO TRY TO REALLY RESOLVE THIS HOUSING CRISIS SO I COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND I URGE YOU ALL TO VOTE HI. THINK YOU SOONER OR LATER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT- I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO COMMENT BECAUSE I WAS WATCHING BILLS LIKE THIS. WHILE I WAS RUNNING AND THIS IS THE FIRST REAL ONE THAT HAS COME UP. SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE AND- I WAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS TWENTY ONE CITIES. AND IN THE LAST EIGHT OR RATIONS OVER STRONG BILL. FROM THE AUTHOR- TWENTY CITIES OPPOSE IT THE ONE BIGGEST SANTA. FOR IT WAS A GOOD I. IN THIS THE CONCERN. OBVIOUSLY OVERRIDING LOCAL LAND USE. BUT THE ISSUED IT TO GO WITH THE SENATOR FROM BERKLEY SAID. HE HE IF OUR IDEA OF CREATING AFFORDABILITY IS CLOSING THE THREE MILLION. UNITS GAP OF HOUSING. WHAT IS NOT GOING TO GET THERE. IN A DECADE OR TWO DECADES. AND SO TO DO BILLS LIKE THIS AND NOT HAVE SOME MEASURE OF AFFORDABILITY AND THEM. IS CHALLENGING A. N. D. THERE ARE DESERT LEAST ONE BUILDER TO DISPUTE GOING ON IN MY DISTRICT. WHERE IT EXPEDITED THE PROCESS WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE. AND YET THE LOCAL CITIES ALREADY HAVE THAT AFFORDABLE. ENDED OVER ROAD THAT SO WAS EXPLORING THE PROCESS WITH NO INCREASE IN AFFORDABLE UNITS AND SO I THINK THE CHALLENGES. IS HOW TO PRESENT THESE BILLS WITH SOME PERCENTAGE FOR MEASURE OF AFFORDABILITY AND- BECAUSE OF ITS GONNA TAKE US TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS. TO GET ENOUGH UNITS TO AFFECT THE MARKET. THE CRISIS THAT EVERYBODY DESCRIBED IS NOT GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY THESE BILLS AND SO I THINK IT'S OUR CHALLENGE. TO FIGURE OUT HOWTHERE IS A PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABILITY IN EACH OF THESE AS THEY COME BY US. AND IN THIS ONE I GIVE CREDIT TO THE OFFER. BECAUSE HE MOVED HE MADE IT VOLUNTARY. BECAUSE IT'S VOLUNTARY. R. WILL LIKELY VOTE FOR. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THERE. SOMETHING A AND- FOR A RECALLDENSITY BONE AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. OR SOME THAT GIVE US A- THAT THERE SO MAJOR OF BEFORE. ONE WE TAKE A STEP THE STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERRIDE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THAT POINT GIVEN THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHOR IS TAKEN ALL VOTE FOR THE BILL. BUT IT'S A FUTURE ONCE COMMA I THINK I'LL BE LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE'S AFFORDABLE BUILDING IN THEM THAT'S SORT OF HOW I WILL JUDGE WHETHER TO LOOK AT THE- CAR AND I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS WORK. THANK YOU SENATOR DELHI. THANK YOU. MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT AS WE ALL HEARD THIS IS A GREAT ATTEMPT TO- TRY TO GET THE DENSITIES WERE COMMUNITIES WANT TO DO IT AND THEY HAVE THE POWERTO DO IT. AS WE SHOULD BUT I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE SENATOR FROM BERKELEY DID BRING UP A GREAT POINT ABOUT PEOPLE EXITING CALIFORNIA. AND BASICALLY THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA IS A SOMETHING THAT. BUT I THINK IT IS AND SHE NOTED THAT. TAXES AREN'T THE REASON THAT PEOPLE ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU REGULATIONS ARE THE REASON PEOPLE ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA WHAT DRIVES UP THE COST OF HOUSING. IS SICK WHAT AND LOCAL TAXES FOR SCHOOLS AND ROADS AND YOU NAME IT IT'S ALL PILED ONTO. THE DEVELOPER AND THAT DRIVES THE COST OF HOUSING- IF WE REALLY TRULY WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT FACE CALIFORNIA AND THE COST OF HOUSING. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DRIVE THE COST OF BUILDING THOSE HOUSES DOWN. TO GET TO THE NUMBERS THAT WE NEED TO GET TO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. TO DO. AND FILL PROJECTS WHERE WE SHOULD WE'RE WE HAVE TRANCE TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE POSITIVE. TO DRIVE THAT COSTS DOWN BUT IF WE REALLY WANT TO TACKLE- THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. GROW MORE HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA AT A RATE WHERE PEOPLE CAN AFFECT THEM WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE COST OF LIVING. AND THE COST OF LIVING IS NOT JUST THE HOUSE. IT'S THE COST OF LIVING FOR FUEL THE COST OF LIVING FOR THE LECTURE CITY THE COST OF LIVING FOR ALL THOSE THINGS ARE ADDED INTO. WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT STATES TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING ACROSS THE BOARD. IS HIGHER THAN OTHER PLACES AND WE NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE. AT SOME POINT. YOU CAN'T JUST CONTINUE TO. ADD THOSE COST ON AND EXPECT PEOPLE NOT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE HERE AND MOVE OUT. AT THE SAME TIME WE TALK ABOUT DRIVING UP. THINGS LIKE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND TRY TO GET UP THEIR-WAGES. BUT WE STILL HAVE TO BE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET. THE COMMODITIES IN THE THINGS THAT WE- HAVE TO OFFER HERE IN CALIFORNIA- HAVE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER STATES AND OTHER NATIONS SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FACED WITH. THIS BILL IS A STREAMLINING PROCESS AND ALLOWS THE LOCALS TO DO THE RIGHT THING I THINK THIS IS STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IF WE REALLY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT. THE OVERALL CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACED WITH WE HAVE TO DRIVE THE COST OF BUILDING THESE HOUSES DOWN. SO I URGE AND I VOTE. THANK YOU HE FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF IT ON THIS ITEM. SCENE KNOWN SORRY. SENATOR GLAZIER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS ATTACKED OFTEN THAT I WOULD JOIN WITH MY FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO- AND- HOUSING BILL ON THIS FLOOR- BUT I'M PLEASED TO DO SO HERE TODAY- I'VE FOURTEEN SMALL CITIES IN MY DISTRICT AND THERE IS BEEN A LOT OF. SKEPTICISM TO SAY THE LEAST FOR A TOP DOWN APPROACH FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW WE NEED TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS CLEARLY A HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE. BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR FROM FROM SAN FRANCISCO IS DONE A TERRIFIC JOB IN TRYING TO FIND THOSE RIGHT NOW IT'S- THAT CERTAINLY BRING ME TO THE PODIUM TODAY TO SAY THAT THIS IS A- A THOUGHTFUL BILL THAT DOES PROVIDE LOCAL CONTROL. AND IT'S ONE THAT I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE. ON THIS ITEM AT THREE TUNE. GOING ONCE. ALL RIGHT SENATOR WINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT BECAUSE AGAIN I DO REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL- DISCUSSION- TO THE SENATOR FROM BEAVER- I AGREE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS IS ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE ZONING IS FUNDAMENTALLY- THE IT'S ABOUT MATH IT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH. NUMERICALLY HOW MANY HOMES ARE LEGAL TO BUILD IN A PARTICULAR AREA AND THIS WILL ALLOW CITIES TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BUILD MORE- AND TO ITS OWN FOR MORE AN EASIER WAY. I DO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR FROM FROM SANTA CRUZ AND AS SOMEONE ALL ON ALL OF THE MANDATORY HOUSING BILLS I'VE AUTHORED SB FIFTY SP THIRTY FIVE TO GO ALL HAVE BASELINE INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENTS UNLESS THE CITY GOES HIGHER. ON THE NOT SO I'M A BELIEVER- INCLUSIONARY AND AFFORDABILITY HERE IN ADDITION TO A CITY COURT ALL THIS ZONING COULD BE FOR A 100% AFFORDABLE BUT ANY LOCAL INCLUSIONARY THAT THE CITY HAS- WILL APPLY TO THIS BILL OTHER CITIES TYPICALLY DON'T START THEIR INCLUSION ORIENTAL TEN UNITS SO I THINK THIS BILL WILL HAVE BENEFITS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT MORE WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO AND I AGREE IT MIGHT TAKE US A FEW DECADES OF FOR DILIGENT THE CLEAR THAT MULTI MILLION HOME SHORTAGE- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY THAT THE BEST TIME TO PLANT A TREE WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO THE SECOND BEST TIME IS TODAY- WE WANT TO FIX IT. HELP PEOPLE NOW INVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME BUT IF WE'RE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS AND OURGREAT GRANDKIDS SO THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY WITH PEOPLE LIVING IN CARS. AND PEOPLE HAVING TO MOVE AWAY IF WE WANT THEM TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN THE TIME TO PLANT THE SEEDS IS NOW S. B. TEN IS ONE OF THOSE SEEDS AND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPO.
