ONE FILE ITEM ONE BY SENATOR ALAN SENATOR ALLEN WHEN YOU ARE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN VERSUS- WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO UPDATE FACTS AND FIGURES BASED ON A RECENT STUDENT LOAN. DATA REPORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT AND ALSO WHILE WE'RE FIXING A DRAFTING ERROR. SO THIS RESOLUTION CALLS ON OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FORGIVE. A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR STUDENT BORROWERS ACROSS THE NATION- AS FOLKS MAY KNOW THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS RISING. AND SIMULTANEOUSLY STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN OUR STATE ACROSS THE NATION IS SKYROCKETED- INCREASING SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED PERCENT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. SO TWENTY TWENTY. OVER A NEARLY FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE OWED MORE- AND- OWED NEARLY TWO TRILLION DOLLARS. IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT IN CALIFORNIA OVER THREE MILLION BORROWERS- NEARLY A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. THAT'S AN AVERAGE OF NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND PER BORROWED TO SPEAKING WITH ONE OF MEMBERS ABOUT AND HIS- DEBT BURDEN- YOU WE KNOW SO MANY CASES THAT ARE IN THE- IN THE IN THE SIX AND- AND EVER SAYS EVERS EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE SAID EVEN SEVEN FIGURES WHICH IS JUST- DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND. STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AND THE BURNING OUR ECONOMY AND ALL SORTS OF WAYS IT DELAYS FOLKS ABILITY TO FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH BUYING A HOME STARTING A BUSINESS. REACHING OTHER FINANCIAL MILESTONES INVESTING EVEN HAVING CHILDREN- PEOPLE OF SAID THAT THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE KIDS IF THEY HAVE A ENORMOUS. DEBT BURDENS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS STUDENTS OF COURSE HE'S FAMILIES CANNOT HELP THEM PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION WHICH OF AND- ACCENTUATES AND EXACERBATES INEQUALITY IS FOR MANY LOW INCOME AND FIRST GENERATION. STUDENTS ARE PRESIDENT OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. AND WOULD LIKE TO URGE THEM URGED HIM TO CANCEL. A MODEST AMOUNT OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT AS WE AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY THAT WILL HAVE FAR FAR MORE STUDENT AT THAT WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THIS. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF DOWN CALDERON VICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AT UC IRVINE. LET'S HEAR FROM MISTER CALDERON. AT&amp;T MODERATOR THE LEAD WITNESS ON THE LINE IS ALLEN CALDERON EXTERNAL VICE PRESIDENT FOR HIS SOCIAIS DID STUDENTS AT UC. IRVINE MISTER CALDERON PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. HE CHAIR MEDINA GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK SENATOR ALAN FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD MY NAME IS ALAN CALDERON AND AS OF YESTERDAY I AM A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE. I AM PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY TO OFFER YOU PASSED SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION ONE CALLING ON PRESIDENT BINDING AND CONGRESS TO FORGIVE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WOULD BE EVER RISING COST OF TUITION AND HOUSING AND THEREFORE HIGHER AMOUNT OF LOAN NEEDED HIGHER EDUCATION IS BECOMING A DREAM DEFERRED. FOR MANY STUDENTS INCLUDING MYSELF WE'RE TALK FROM A YOUNG AGE THAT ATTENDING COLLEGE IS A NECESSITY FOR MANY STUDENTS FROM A LOW INCOME BACKGROUND THAT IS VERY MUCH THE MENTALITY BUT OFTEN NOT A REALITY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF ATTENDANCE. THAT IS THE BURDEN BEYOND THE COMPLETION OF OUR EDUCATION IF ALL OF THE TO OUR CAREER AND CAN BE A HUGE OBSTACLE TO HOME OWNERSHIP OR STARTING A FAMILY STUDENT LOAN DEBT CAN BE AND OFTEN IS A LIFELONG ISSUE. IN THE SUBJECT AN EDUCATION ISSUE IT'S AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE FOR GIVING FOR CANCELING STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND A COMMITMENT TO THE STUDENTS EDUCATION AND A COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY PREDATORY LENDERS. CANCELING STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS MORE THAN JUST AN EDUCATION ISSUE AGAIN. IF AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE. WELL SOMEONE FOR PRO ALL OVER EXIST. THEY ARE OFTEN FAR TOO LIMITED TO CERTAIN FIELDS OR LACK GUIDANCE. WHEN PEOPLE MAKE THE DECISION TO START THEIR COMMUNITY THEY SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY PLACED. ON THE TOP TO DEBT FORGIVENESS AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS ALSO NEED TO BE FAR MORE EXPANSIVE. MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE SET TO BENEFIT WHAT THE DEBT FORGIVENESS. PARAMOUNT'S TO MILLIONS OF DEGREES EDUCATED MIND ENTERING THE COMPOST. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS EDUCATION ESPECIALLY HIGHER EDUCATION. IS THE DREAM FOR MANY HARD WORKING STUDENTS. PLEASE HELP US ACHIEVE IT EQUITABLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON WE WILL NOW MOVE TO A PUBLIC COMMENT.

YOUR POSITION AS A TRAINER IN A PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. NONALIGNED AND KIA. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR WITH. YES THANK YOU AND GOODBYE THREE KIDS THAT WENT TO COLLEGE I KNOW WHAT AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN IT IS- TO HAVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND OBVIOUSLY MANY PEOPLE ARE STAYING IN THEIR ENTIRE WORKING LIFE PAYING OFF STUDENT LOANS AND REYES RESOLUTION OFFICE CERTAINLY I WILL SUPPORT IT BUT WE DO HEAR ANECDOTALLY THAT- DOING THIS WILL MOSTLY BENEFITS A MIDDLE TO UPPER CLASS- STUDENTS ARE WORKERS AND NOT NECESSARILY- B. VISIT THE STUDENTS THAT. WENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST AND T A STATE SCHOOL AFTER SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT WOULD BENEFIT MOST FROM THIS. IF YOU IF YOU COULD ADDRESS IT OR DRESSING YOUR CLOTHES WHICH EVER YOU KNOW I MEAN EITHER I APPRECIATE THE COMMON GREAT DEAL I WILL SAY- THAT. YOU KNOW KIDS WHO COME FROM WEALTHY FAMILIES TYPICALLY DON'T TAKE ON- AND- YOUR LOANS. ARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO WRITE A MINUTES ULTIMATELY EXPENSIVE TO TAKE ON LOANS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE- THE INTEREST RATES THAT ARE TYPICALLY GIVEN INCLUDING ON THE PUBLIC LOANS- SO IT'S IT IS TYPICALLY PEOPLE WHO COME FROM LOWER INCOME OR- LOWER MIDDLE INCOME BACK BACKGROUNDS. WHO TAKE ON THESE LOANS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW FINANCE THEIR WAY THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE ACCRUED- BUT I DO THINK CAN I GET TO THE POINT. WHERE WE'RE WE'RE SURE AND ASK PEOPLE TO ASK SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE AMOUNT OF LOAN DEBT REALLY IS JUSTIFIED. HI HE IN SPITE OF THE GREAT BENEFITS AT A COLLEGE DEGREE I CAN BRING SOMEBODY AND I WILL SAY THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT ENORMOUS LOAN THAT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN YOU NEVER FINISH A COLLEGE DEGREE- OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF THE- THE FINANCIAL TROUBLE THEY PUT THEMSELVES AND SO- YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF ARE WE YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS IN EUROPE RIGHT NOW AND- IN IF YOU TAKE A I WAS LEADING A PEACE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IN OUR ARE PARTNERS IN EUROPE. I'D TYPICALLY ONLY CHARGE A VERY NOMINAL AMOUNTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE WHAT IT SOCIETAL BENEFITS THEY'RE IS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH WITH WITH HAVING KIDS GO TO COLLEGE AND GET THE EDUCATION THE TRAINING OUT HERE THAT I STATES WE'VE ENDED UP CREATING SYSTEM THE COST SO MUCH MONEY AND IT'S BECOME AN ENORMOUS COST DRIVER IN SO MANY ASPECTS OF OUR OF OUR LIFE IF YOU LOOK AT AND HEALTH CARE FOR EXAMPLE- AND THE THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE HAVE POLITICALLY TO PUTTING IN PLACE A BETTER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF OUR DOCTORS. ARE WHO YOU KNOW I'VE EVER COULD SO MUCH THAT THEY FEEL THE NEED TO TURN BACK THE MONEY THAT THEY LOST ASSOCIATE WITH GETTING THEIR THEIR THEIR MEDICAL EDUCATION A LOT OF OUR EUROPEAN AND ASIAN COUNTERPARTS YOU KNOW OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET DOT GO TO GO TO BECOME DOCTORS BASICALLY GET TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR FREE- BECAUSE THERE'S A YEAH THERE'S A RECOGNITION OF THE SOCIETAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH TRAINING GOOD HIGH QUALITY DOCKS. SO AT YEAH THAT'S THE GUY YEAH I WISH WE HAD A BETTER SYSTEM- WE DON'T AND- AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS A WAY TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT A LOT OF. PEOPLE WHO COME FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. HAVE TAKEN ON ENORMOUS DEBT JUST TO BE ABLE TO GO. AND GET A HIGHER EDUCATION. AS I SAY THE WEALTHY YOU KNOW THOSE COMING FOR THE WEALTHIEST FAMILIES DON'T HAVE pTO AGREE DEBT- AND DONE AND IT'S A RECOGNITION OF THE FACT IS WE- WE ENGAGE IN ALL SORTS OF. FORMS OF. SUPPORTS AND WELFARE. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. COLLUDING FOR MASSIVE CORPORATIONS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A THIS IS A WORTHY- CADRE OF. YOUNG AMERICANS WHO WE CAN HELP. TAKE THAT DEBT BURDEN OFF THEIR SHOULDERS SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY START TO PUT THEIR RESOURCES INTO BUILDING A LIFE FOR THEMSELVES STARTING UP A NEW BUSINESS BUYING A HOME- YEAH- YOU HAVING KIDS- YOU KNOW BUILDING A- A LIFE FOR THEMSELVES SO AS TO BE ABLE TO- TO. TO BOTH BENEFIT FROM THEIR EDUCATION AND ALSO HOW OUR SOCIETY BENEFIT FROM THEIR EDUCATION. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN. DR CHOI. SENATE ALLEN- THANK YOU FOR. EXPLAINING AND OF MY QUESTIONS- TO MYSELF AND TO YOUR SOFTPHONE MIGHT BE EVEN THOUGH THE INTENT TO. OF A FOR GIVING UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF- STUDENT DEBT- YOU KNOW SO SUDDEN OPERABLE PEOPLE. BUT THE I WONDER. THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF- I SHOULD RUN LOAN AND SO FOR THEM TO. I'LL BE ABLE TO- GET THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION. IT COULD BE BACHELOR'S DEGREE MASTER'S DEGREE OF DOCTOR DEGREE. SO THAT THE PERSON INDIVIDUAL WILL HAVE A EARNING OUR THE ABILITY TO. EARN THEIR WAGES ARE AND THE PAY BACK. SO THAT THE MONEY CAN BE UTILIZED FOR NEXT GENERATION ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE NEED THE SAME. MONEY FINANCIAL RESOURCES SO THE TIRES THE CYCLE. ALL OF US OWN. BUT IT IF YOU. FROM HERE. ON DOWN THE ORIGIN OR INTENT- IS- THE DAMAGES AND THE FUTURE HOW LONG- THE GOVERNMENT. INDIVIDUALS AND THAT THE WILL WILL- NONSTOP BARI AND- EXPECTING. A THE GOVERNMENTAL ORDER ORDER IT WEIGHED BY OUR EXAMPLE IS THAT THE MY SISTER AND MY BROTHER IN LAW. THEY GOT A JOB IN A RURAL AREA. OF A PENNSYLVANIA- JUST BECAUSE OF OUR GOVERNMENT'S- THOSE CHILDREN LONG THAT THE WAIVER IF THEY WENT TO THAT AREA. UNDERSERVED AREA- BECAUSE IT WAS A RURAL AREA NOT TOO MANY- DOCTORS COME IN THERE FOR FIVE YEARS SO- IF THE SERVER THERE THAT WOULD BE WAIVED THE HOUSE OF THAT'S WHY THEY TOLD US THAT THE COUNTRYSIDE. AND THEY FELL IN LOVE AND THE DESTINY CARE. AND THOUGH THEY MADE ENOUGH MONEY- AND- THEY ENJOY THEIR LIFE THEIR- AND THE FEELING THE NEED FOR THAT AREA SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS. WE CAN EXCUSE THEIR LOANS. END UP GOVERNMENT OF TEN UTILIZED TO VOICE OUR- OUR PEOPLE OUT WITH A COLLEGE EDUCATION. THEY ARE NOT DIFFERENT GROUPS OF ALL VOLUNTEER STUFF. SIRTIS OVERSEAS WAS A PEACE CORPS OF YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE SENT TO UNDERSERVED AREAS AND FOR FIVE YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS ADJUSTING AFTER MILITARY SERVICE AT THAT AND YOU WANT THAT CAN BE WAIVED. BUT THIS ONE JUST ARE GIVING AWAY- THE INDIVIDUAL SO THOSE ARE NO INCENTIVES AND THEN HOW LONG. IF THIS- RESOLUTION IS HAD TAKEN UP BY THE CONGRESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE A LOWLY BE FROM NOW ON. OR RETROACTIVITY ACTIVELY IN THE FUTURE HOW LONG FIVE YEARS WHAT UP TO THIS YEAR ONE NEXT TEN YEARS HOW LONG WILL IT CONTINUE. THIS SYSTEM IS SO TAKING AWAY ALL THE INCENTIVES AND THE UNFAIRNESS. AND THE FOR THE TAXPAYERS MONEY- AND I THINK- WE HAVE A BETTER WAYS TO A UTILIZED AT THE OLD THOSE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT COLLEGES BECAUSE TO WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO HIRE THE OWNING ABILITY. TO HIGHER EDUCATION BUT AFTER THAT. WITH A DISS CONDITIONS OLDER WAYS THE- YOU YOUR DATA I DON'T THINK THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT WAY TO GO. THIS OPINION. MR LEVINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR- PRESENTING THIS RESOLUTION STUDENT THAT IS A PROBLEM IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD A LOT OF ISSUES WITH IT- NO NO MATTER WHAT THAT SIZE- ON ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO ADJUST. INTEREST RATES. AS WELL- FROM CERTAIN BORROWERS AND- AND SO I YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY SYMBOLIC BILL ASKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SPEND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MONEY A CERTAIN WAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WIDELY. IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE- TO JUST SAY ANYONE WHO HAS AS MUCH AS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF DEBT- IF YOU JUST BE WIPED AWAY- BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE DO SUBSIDIZE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION QUITE A BIT. PARTICULARLY THROUGH ALL OF OUR EFFORTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE POSSIBLE THE YEARS. IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM- I DON'T HAVE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT OTHER SIDE OF IT I THINK YOU KNOW IF WE WANT TO. SUPPORT MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES- THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT'S FINE BUT- WE ALSO DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. HOW MANY WAYS. HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS FAMILIES SUPPORT STUDENTS OR STUDENTS SUPPORT THEMSELVES FOR EXAMPLE. THOSE WHO ARE WORKING AT THE SAME TIME IS GOING TO SCHOOL. OR THOSE WHO ARE. PUTTING THEIR OWN SAVINGS AND SAID INTO THEIR CHILDREN'S COLLEGE EDUCATION RATHER THAN INTO THE RETIREMENT SECURITY. WHICH IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES. THAT THIS DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AT ALL AND- YOU KNOW I TRY TO KEEP UP ON THE LITERATURE SOME HIS BOTH TRYING TO SAVE FOR MY CHILDREN'S COLLEGES WELL AS SUPPORT OF MY OWN FUTURE. AND THAT BORROWING MONEY FOR COLLEGE IS A BETTER INVESTMENT THAN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BORROW MONEY FOR RETIREMENT. SO YOU KNOW WE'RE YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE INFORMING PEOPLE ABOUT THAT THE FINANCIAL DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE MAKING ON BEHALF OF THEIR FAMILIES- AND SO I THINK- I THINK IT'S KIND OF A BLUNT INSTRUMENT I MEAN I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND- YOU KNOW YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING HUMBOLDT. THE RESOLUTION WHICH I'M SURE. WILL NOT GET FURTHER THAN THE MEN'S FOR TAKING- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO ARE GOING TO COLLEGE. NOT NECESSARILY- THE INSTRUMENT TO HELP- CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE AMERICAN FAMILIES REALLY PLAN FOR BOTH THEIR THE RETIREMENT SECURITY. AS WELL AS- HAVING CAREERS WHERE YOU'RE MAKING MORE MONEY THAN PEOPLE THAT DON'T GO TO COLLEGE SO. ON YOU KNOW THAT'S THE COST OF YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY GOING TO COLLEGES ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE- IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE ON SOME DEBT. MAYBE YOU'VE MADE A RATIONAL DECISION NOT TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR NOT TO WORK WHILE GOING TO COLLEGE. OR TO TAKE ON THE DEBT THAT YOU'VE DECIDED TO TAKE ON- SO- SO I THINK. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN JUST ST EVERYONE GETS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE I'VE GOT A- COUSIN IN GERMANY. WHOSE SON IS GOING TO GO TO A GERMAN UNIVERSITY BECAUSE IT'S FREE. AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF WE JUST SAID. EVERYONE WHO'S BORN IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULDN'T BE NICE CAN GO TO UC OR CSU. WE HAVE SAID THIS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIANS- BUT IT'S JUST A BIT OF A BLUNT- BLUNT INSTRUMENT I THINK HE'S A LOT MORE WORK PARTICULARLY IF. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING ON THIS PROBLEM THANKS. THANK YOU MR LEVINE. SAY NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR ALAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WELL I LISTEN I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION AND I WILL SAY- OF COURSE IT'S A BLUNT INSTRUMENT IT'S IN IT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS SO FUNDAMENTALLY IN PERFECT. YOU KNOW I WOULD MUCH PREFER THE GERMAN MODEL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WHERE WHERE WHERE WHERE THERE'S A SOCIETAL RECOGNITION OF A SOCIETY WIDE BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH- FREE TO LOW COST HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR FOR THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST AND FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS SO IS TO PROVIDE AVENUES. OUR FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY. AND YOU KNOW AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IN GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE THERE'S A LOT MORE SOCIAL MOBILITY I MEAN THE CHANCES. OF GETTING. OF MOVING UP THE LADDER HERE IN UNITED STATES IF YOU'RE IN THE LOWEST QUINTILES- IS SO MUCH LOWER THAN IN- IN GERMANY OR IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE IN SPITE OF THE- OUR FEALTY TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. I WHICH WHICH KIND OFCONTINUES TO SELL THIS IDEA THAT THAT THAT THERE IS SOCIAL MOBILITY BUT THERE ACTUALLY IS FAR LESS. THAN IN THE COUNTRIES THAT YOU MENTIONED ASSEMBLY MEMBER I REALLY DO THINK THAT A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR- SOCIETAL AND POLICY- A- FOCUS. WHEN IT COMES TO I'M PUTTING IN INVESTMENTS UPFRONT INVESTMENTS IN YOUNG PEOPLE I BOTH EVERYTHING FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD TO- TO THE ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS REALLY THE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. OUT SO. I DON'T THINK I WOULD SAY IS THAT WHILE YOU WELL IT'S TRUE THAT THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM IT'S ALL IT'S GOTTEN SO MUCH WORSE IT'S SO MUCH WORSE MEMBERS. THEN EVEN WHEN MOST OF US. WERE GOING TO COLLEGE I JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA. IF YOU COMPARE THE NUMBERS TODAY TO WHAT THEY WERE BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE. V. V. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF DEBT HAS GONE UP OVER TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. EVEN THOUGH THE SALARIES. HAVE ONLY GONE UP ABOUT. ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. SO THERE'S BEEN A HUGE. A HUGE SPIKE IN THAT INCREASE. I. SO MUCH MORE THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND I'VE BEEN AND I WAS I'M TALKING IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IF YOU GO BACK. TO SOME OF THE OLDER TIMERS HERE IN THE BUILDING. YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY THEY THEY WERE GOING TO SCHOOL TIME WHEN THE TUITION LEVELS WERE SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY ARE GERMANY AND THEY REALLY BENEFITED AND THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT ALL THAT EXTRA. YOUR BRAIN POWER AND MONEY THAT THEY EARNED INTO BUILDING OUR ECONOMY AND GROWING OUR ECONOMY. TO MY FRIEND THE VICE CHAIR I'M IF YOU WOULD BE MEANINGFUL FOR MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS I'M ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO WORK ON EITHER A NEW RESOLUTION OR TWEAKING THIS ONE. TO REALLY FOCUS IN ON A ROBUST. LOAN FORGIVENESS SYSTEM FOR EVERYTHING FROM PUBLIC SERVICE OR LOW PAID- WORK THE PEOPLE TAKE ON IT'S TRUE THAT A COLLEGE DEGREE- OFTEN PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH A HIGHER SALARY BUT CERTAINLY NOT ALWAYS. ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE TAKE THEIR THEIR DEGREE AND THEY DON'T GET PAID ANYWHERE NEAR AS WELL AS THEY COULD BECAUSE THEY PURSUE THEIR PASSIONS ARE THEY GO OFF AND DO. A LOWER PAID WORK OFTENTIMES ARE LOWER PAID WORK REALLY DOES HAVE AN TRêN CREDIBLE SOCIETAL BENEFIT EVEN IF IT'S NOT A HIGH FINANCIAL BENEFIT FOR THE WORKER. I'VE AND SO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A WAY THAT YOU AND I CAN WORK ON ON ON A MEASURE THAT WOULD REALLY TARGET. ARE THOSE FOLKS WHO DECIDE TO TAKE ON LOWER SALARIES- WHO DO WHO HAVE GONE TO LOWER SERVED AREAS AND IN RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS YOU DISCUSSED. I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON- ON A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD THAT WOULD REALLY ZERO IN ON THOSE ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO'VE WHO'VE TAKEN ON THOSE CHALLENGES AND BURDENS AND- AB SO I CERTAINLY HAVE AN OPEN DOOR. I AM NOT I DON'T HAVE ANY ILLUSIONS THAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ALL JUST A RESOLUTION AND- ULTIMATELY GONNA BE THE FELLOW THAT GOVERNMENT'S DECISION EVEN IF IT. IF IT. PURSUES A PER. EXACTLY ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT I'VE CALLED FOR- THESE THESE BROAD PROBLEMS THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY IT WOULD NOT BE SOLVED BUT I DO THINK. IT WILL GO. IT WILL TAKE ASSIST. A STEP FURTHER. TOWARD TOWARD HELPING. YOU THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WE TOLD. WE SAID IT AND GO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T COME FROM A WEALTHY FAMILY. TAKE ON THAT DEBT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH IT FOR YOU AND YET NOW THEY'RE FINDING THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN'T EVEN AFFORD A HOUSE THEY CAN'T EVEN START A BUSINESS THEY CAN'T. RAISE A FAMILY AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE BUT I AM UNDER NO ILLUSIONS THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE THE MASSIVE PROBLEMS THAT I HOPE WE ALL WORK TOGETHER. TO HELP TO SOLVE TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE FAIR. ON SO WITH THAT I CERTAINLY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BUT I ALSO RESPECT THE OPPOSITION AND CONCERNS. THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED HERE TODAY. IN THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN. THE RISING COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION AS WE'VE SAID HERE THIS AFTERNOON HAS BECAUSE STUDENTS TO SEEK ADDITIONAL METHODS OF PAYING THEIR EDUCATION THE ON SCHOLARSHIPS AND GRANTS AND CURRENTLY THERE ARE ROUGHLY FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE FEDERAL AND PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS EQUATING TO CLOSE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. SO RELEASING GRADUATES FROM THE BURDEN OF PAYING FOR STUDENT LOANS ALLOW AS OUR SENATORS SAID INVEST IN THE FUTURE LIFE MILESTONES LIKE BUYING A HOUSE INVESTING IN THE ECONOMY SO I THANK THE SENATOR SENATOR ALAN FOR IT- ACCEPTING THE- SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS I WILL BE SUPPORTING AS J.
