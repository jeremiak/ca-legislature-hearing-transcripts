GIVEN THE CURRENT DISTANCE LEARNING EDUCATION SYSTEM EVEN IF IT RECENT PLAN FORCE. FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO OPEN. OFTENTIMES CANNOT PHYSICALLY VISIT THE SCHOOL TO ACQUIRE MATERIALS THAT WOULD BE TAUGHT TO THEIR CHILDREN'S. SECTION FIVE ONE THREE NINE EIGHT B. ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT REQUIRES THAT PARENTS BE NOTIFIED THAT THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION. SCHOOLS MAY BE LEGALLY EXPOSED IF THEY DO NOT PROVIDE THE MATERIALS FOR PARENT PARENTAL REVIEW. AND LIMITING IN PERSON INSPECTION DURING DISTANCE LEARNING LEAVES. THE INTERNET AS THE ONLY OPTION FOR COMPLIANCE. THE SHIFT TO THE INTERNET BASED DISTANCE LEARNING HAS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOLS TO GET PARENTS MORE ENGAGED IN THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION AND THIS BILL HELPS FOR THAT GOAL. WE ALL ALL WE ARE DOING HERE IS TO ENSURE THAT PARENTS CAN BE ENGAGED AT. THE LEVEL THEY CHOOSE IN THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION WITH ME TODAY I HAVE.

IN CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS FAILED OR REFUSED BY THE COMMISSION OF PARENTS. AND PARENTS REQUESTED IT EVEN WHEN THE PARENTS SHOWED UP IN PERSON. THE DISTRICT OFFICE.

BUT NOT MANDATED SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDE INFORMATION TO PARENTS IN ORDER TO ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THAT DECISION. WE CURRENTLY UNFAVORABLE POSITION OF MAKING THAT DECISION. AND AVOID. PRINT ALL OF ALL THAT IS WHY WE PROVIDING INPUT AND HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

FENDER GLAZER AN INCENTIVE CORTESE. THANK YOU I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR NOT NOT GIVING UP ON A BILL AND TRYING TO FIND COMMON GROUND I APPRECIATE THAT- I DIDN'T SUPPORT THE MEASURE PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF LOCAL CONTROL IS A VERY BIG DEAL TO ME- BUT- I GUESS I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION TO- TO WITH THE- LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS. THAT MAN I'M SURE THAT'S OKAY THAT'S MISSED OUT FROM THE ACLU YES PLEASE PROCEED SO- AND OBVIOUSLY THE NUMBER OF THE GROUPS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION GROUPS THAT I HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION FOR SO- HEARING THAT OPPOSITION AND LOOKING CAREFULLY AT IT I TAKE IT VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. MISTER OUT. USE THE PHRASE AND THAT THIS WOULD BRING THIS BILL WOULD BRING US QUOTE BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. AND AS I READ- THIS MEASURE RICHEST. IT REQUIRES THAT A NOTICE ABOUT HOW PARENTS CAN INSPECT THAT THAT'S ALL I READ THE BILL DOING IS GIVING GUIDANCE ON HOUSE SO YOU CAN CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME HOW BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND I KNOW THIS IS A SENSITIVE TOPIC I AND I APPRECIATE THAT A LOT OF STRONG FEELINGS. COME OUT ON THIS IN THIS AREA BUT HOW DOES JUST NOT NOTIFYING PARENTS HOW THEY CAN ACT INSPECTOR THROUGH. THE MATERIAL. ROAD BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT BUILT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE. MANY DISTRICT TO ADOPT POLICIES NOT JUST ABOUT THE ADOPTION OF CURRICULA- BUT HOW THAT CURRICULA IS MADE AVAILABLE THAT WOULD REQUIRE- SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PICK UP ANOTHER VOTE- ONLINE- IT CAN TO SORT OF NAVIGATE AND FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS OF THIS NEW LANDSCAPE AT THE THOUGHT OPPOSING FIRM FOR POSTING MATERIAL ONLINE- AND- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MANY MUCH OF THIS MATERIAL IS COPYRIGHTED THAT WOULD REQUIRE CAREFUL DISTRICT. CONSIDERATION ON HOW TO NAVIGATE THE LEGAL LIABILITIES OF THAT AND- YOU KNOW IT WOULD REQUIRE FOR THE EVENTUALLY TO REVISIT THAT TOPIC- AND IN OUR EXPERIENCE. ALTHOUGH MANY DISTRICT BURKE- HAVE THE BOARD ADOPTED AND THAT PROCESS WITH NEW AND SOME THAT HAVE BEEN A CHALLENGE- DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF OBJECTION THAT DID NOT. TO INDIVIDUAL CURRICULA ITSELF BUT TO THE CONTENT THAT IS MANDATED BY BY CHAYA LED BY A SMALL GROUP OF FOLKS TO JACK TO SOME OF THAT. I REQUIREMENTS ESPECIALLY AROUND INCLUSIVITY AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BROADER CONCERN BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE BILL MANAGER IF YOU ARE OUR CONSULTANTS ARE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. S. B. THIS IS THE CRITERIA YES I WOULD I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT- AND MAYBE THE OPPOSITION IS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT ABOUT NEW CURRICULUM THIS IS ABOUT THE CURRICULUM THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THIS BILL IS ABOUT ACCESS MAKING SURE THE PARENTS HAVE ACCESS. TO REVIEW THE INFORMATION AUTHOR MY CORRECT. THE SENATE BETTER OKAY VERY GOOD. OKAY BECAUSE- AGAIN I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THE TOPIC AND- THE OPINIONS THAT. PEOPLE HAVE STRONG OPINIONS IN THIS SPACE. BUT ONCE AGAIN AS I LOOK AT THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US IT'S JUST SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT ACCESS SO THAT'S WHERE I'M STRUGGLING. AND CERTAINLY WOULD WELCOME COST COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES SEE IF THEY'RE SEEING IT DIFFERENTLY- BUT APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION. THANK THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER CORTESE. THE COMMISSION SURE- JUST A- BUT THE QUESTION OF FOR THE AUTHOR IF I MAY HAVE BEEN JUST LET ME JUST SORT OF SET THE STAGE FOR- IT FOR A COUPLE REASONS ONE I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A MISCONSTRUED AS JUST BRING THIS UP FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW I KNOW WE HAD A VERY BRIEF BUT- I THINK CONCISE CONVERSATION OR COMMUNICATION- THE LAST TIME- WE- WE HEARD THIS TOPIC IN. IL MY CONCERN WAS. I'M ALL FOR TRANSPARENCY I REALLY DO TAKE. OF THE AUTHOR- ED HIS WORD IN TERMS OF THAT'S THAT'S THE THRUST LISTS. WHAT'S WRONGWITH TRANSPARENCY- MY CONCERN IS SINGLING OUT ONE SUBJECT- FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT. JUST SAYING IF WE NEED TRANSPARENCY LET'S DO IT ACROSS THE BOARD AND I THINK. IT IT'S IT RAISES CONCERNS AND SUSPICIONS- IN. MAYBE NONE OF THAT IS WARRANTED BUT- MY SENSE IS THAT NGUYEN. IN THE ISM IN ON ONE PARTICULAR SUBJECT PEOPLE SAY WHY THAT IN IN- TO SEE LET ME LET ME. A QUICK EXAMPLE AND THEN I'LL- I'LL GET OFF THE FLOOR HERE BUT- AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WE HAD LOTS OF ISSUES WERE I ARGUED CURRICULUM BY CURRICULUM WE SHOULD HAVE GREATER TRANSPARENCY SOME OF THEM. WERE BECAUSE OF PARTISAN SHIP GOVERNMENT CLASSES PIPING IN A TELEVISION CONTENT TO OUR CLASSROOMS FOR EXAMPLE- I ARGUED. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING PARTISAN CONTENT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SHOULD WE HAVE GREATER TRANSPARENCY- I CAN GIVE MORE EXAMPLES I WON'T IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- BUT- HE THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ADDRESS IT. OF MY SENSE. IT HAD POINT IS AS A RAISE THE QUESTION IS- YOU KNOW THAT AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW- I WOULD THAT WOULD NOT BE VOTING ON THIS BILL ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THAT CERTIFICATE BEFORE I MAKE THE FINAL DECISION I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU- AND I AND AGAIN. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I THINK- TO PARAPHRASE MYSELF THE LAST TIME AROUND- I WOULD I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT AND PERHAPS EVEN CO AUTHOR BILL THAT. THAT TAKES THIS LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY ACROSS THE BOARD ALL EDUCATION SUBJECT MATTER BECAUSE I THINK. THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD BECAUSE IN AND OF ITSELF. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND BEFORE I ASK YOU TO RESPOND US SENATOR DOLLY. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THAT. THE OPPOSITE ORIGINALLY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE BILL OR HAVING IF THE EVERYTHING HAS TO BE TRANSLATED. INTO THE LANGUAGE OF CHOICE- WHICH I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT CAN BE TIME CONSUMING IT CAN BE AND WILL BE. AND SO I ASK THE AUTHOR TO TAKE THAT OUT THINKING THAT THAT WOULD REMOVE OPPOSITION. AND SO I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THEY ARE STILL OPPOSED. THEN I RESPECT THESE GROUPS GREATLY TO I DO A LOT OF WORK WITH THEM AS WELL. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I WAS SURPRISED THAT IT DIDN'T REMOVE ANY OPPOSITION EITHER. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BEFORE I GO TO SENATOR DOLLY. SENATE ALI AND I THINK YOU WERE GOING TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. YES SO FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR BECAUSE- SHE'S DILIGENTLY WORKED WITH ME AND- TRYING TO SHEPHERD THIS BILL THROUGH AND- I WAS. I WAS A CO AUTHOR THIS BILL BEFORE AND- THE AUTHOR- DIDN'T ACCEPT THE MINUTES AND DIDN'T WORK WITH A CHAIR AND I THOUGHT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE I THINK WE WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. IF IT BEFORE CO THAT HAPPENED I THINK THIS IS A- VERY GOOD BILL. TO ANSWER A CENTER CORTESE'S QUESTION LOOK I. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ALL THE CURRICULUM PUT UP THERE THIS IS A VERY. SENSITIVE AREA OBVIOUSLY FOR- YOU FEEL HER LOTS OF TESTIMONY TODAY AND YOU KNOW. I'M A I'M A- PARENT OF ELEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. AND- I'M ENGAGE WITH WITH HER EDUCATION ASSAM I KNOW MOST ALL PARENTS ARE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S BEING TAUGHT TO YOUR CHILDREN WHEN AND HAVE WHAT IT WHAT THE ACTUAL CURRICULUM IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK PARENTS SHOULD BE ENGAGE AND I THINK THAT'S- WHY THIS. PART OF THIS- CURRICULUM HAS BEEN PUT OUT ITS PURPOSE I'VE ASKED FOR TO BE PUT UP ON THE INTERNET BASICALLY WE ARE NOT. CHANGING ANY CURRICULUM THE CURRICULUM THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED. IS ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TO JUST BE PUT UP ON THE INTERNET SO PARENTS WHO CAN'T GET TO THE SCHOOL OR DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO IN AND DIG THROUGH ALL THE MATERIAL. THAT THE MATERIALS AVAILABLE. SO THE QUESTION ABOUT COPYWRITING AS WELL. IF IT'S CAUGHT HABITS IT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED. PUBLISHED IN ITS HEAD OKAY FOR THE SCHOOL THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY COPYWRITING- PROBLEMS IT'S FREE IT'S TO THAT YOUR TWITTER TEACHER STUDENT. SO I DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT ARGUMENT OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ALL THE LAWS AROUND COPY WRITING BUT I KNOW THAT. IF IT'S AVAILABLE TO MY CHILD IN THE CLASSROOM IS AVAILABLE TO ME. AND THE TO THE% PUBLIC OF WHAT WE'RE TEACHING OUR CHILDREN SO THAT. THE ARGUMENT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WE ARE NOT. I CAN I WANT TO STRESS WE ARE NOT ASKING TO CHANGE CURRICULUM ALL WE SIMPLY ARE ASKING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION DO. IS PUT THAT INFORMATION UP. I WANTED IT TO BE TRANSLATED SO EVERYBODY COULD. ACTUALLY ACCESS I THINK THAT SOMETHING MAY WE SHOULD WORK ON AS A LEGISLATURE FOR ALL MATERIALS I THINK YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT. IN CALIFORNIA THE DIVERSE POPULATION IN LANGUAGES WE HAVE YOUR AND THE BARRIERS FOR THOSE FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE SO I WAS HOPING THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT THIS BILL. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S GONNA DRIVE THE COST UP IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR SMALL. SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT I'LL TAKE WHAT I CAN GET IN THIS AREA I TOOK THE AMENDMENTS FOR. FROM THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION I WOULD LOVE TO GO THERE BUT AT THIS TIME I DON'T THINK WE CAN. WE CAN GET THERE FOR A BROADER- INFORMATION TO BE PUT UP BUT FOR IN THIS AREA- AS I STATED EARLIER IT'S BEEN VERY. DIFFICULT FOR SOME PARENTS AND IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE AREA- FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE. CHILDREN WANTED MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S BEING TAUGHT WHEN IT'S BEING TAUGHT AND YOU KNOW WE CAN ENGAGE IN THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SO. WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I REALLY WANT TO JUST STRESS- THE HELP FROM THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY WE HAVE A MOTION. HELLO YES OKAY SORRY ONE MOMENT. SENATE MCGUIRE AND CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER. IN PERSON FROM US I JUST WANNA SAY HOW MUCH I RESPECT AND ENJOY WORKING WITH CENTER DOLLY THAT HE'S ONE OF THE BESTAND VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK. I THINK MY ISSUE ON THIS SPECIFIC BILL TO FULL NUMBER ONE AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER MY WIFE IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL MY GRANDFATHER WAS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL ON THE ISSUE OF SEX SAID. IF A PARENT AND GUARDIAN WANTS TO BE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF THOSE CLASSES THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO NOW. NUMBER TWO. IF THEY WANT TO REVIEW THE MATERIAL. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO NOW. IN NO OTHER SUBJECT. ARE WE POSTING CURRICULUM ONLINE. WE DON'T DO IT. SO WHY SINGLE THIS ISSUE OUT IF THE ABILITY FOR THE PARA THE GUARDIAN TO ALREADY- TAKE THAT STUDENT OUT OF THE CLASS. AND THEN SECONDLY TO REVIEW THE MATERIAL WORKING COLLABORATIVE LEE WITH THAT DISTRICT IT'S THE PARENT OR THE GUARDIAN TRIED. AGAIN TIS IS NOTHING AGAINST THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I GREATLY RESPECT AUTHOR WE WORK TOGETHER ON MANY ISSUES ARE NOT TO RESOURCES- BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN I JUST I HAVE. CONCERN ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE BECAUSE CANDIDLY I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EED IS. FOR THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE AND NOT EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE I DON'T FIND THAT FOLKS ARE HAVING A CHALLENGE REVIEWING THE MATERIAL IF THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT OR OPT IN OR STUDENTS HAVE. SIGNATURE THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE CENTER GLAZER. HELLO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- I JUST WANT TO. PROVIDE A COUPLE CLARIFYING POINTS BEFORE THE VOTE. ONE IS THAT THIS IS NOT THE SAME BILL THAT WE HEARD BY A DIFFERENT AUTHOR IN A PREVIOUS YEAR IF. THAT BILL- WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A PARENTAL CONSENT AND OPT IN. NUMBER- THAT FOR SEXUAL HEALTH AND HIV PREVENTION EDUCATION THAT THAT IS NOWHERE IN THIS BILL. NUMBER IN THIS BILL AND THIS BILL. HAS ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSLATION AS WE HAVE JUST DISCUSSED THAT IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE- AND SO ALL I'VE SEEN IN THIS BILL- IS IT IS IT ISSUE OF ACCESS AND IT'S A GENTLE- HOW- THAT FOR ME- WHO IS A VERY- PROTECTIVE OF LOCAL CONTROL THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN MAKE THESE CHOICES NOW AND- AND EVEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSLATIONS WILL. IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 15% OF YOUR POPULATION- LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT TRANSLATION. THAT IS PART OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADERSHIP AND I HOPE THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN. I'M GLAD THAT WE DON'T IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A STATE MANDATE WHAT WE PLAYED YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THAT. A DIFFERENT TOPIC AREAS AND IT'S A SENSITIVE ONE BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WE WANT TO- A CELEBRATE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR GREAT STATE- BUT ALL THAT THIS BILL SEEMS TO BE DOING IT AND EVERYTHING THAT I CAN SEE IS THIS ISSUE OF. OF ACCESS OF HOUSE AND I'M A BIG SUPPORTER TRANSPARENCY AND APPRECIATE THE SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE'S LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. AS WELL AND BEFORE TO PARTNER WITH HIM ON ON OTHER APPLE APPLE WAYS WE CAN DO THAT AND HERE'S THE THING. IF WE HAD ANOTHER SENSITIVE SUBJECT WE TALK ABOUT SLIPPERY SLOPE. IF WE HAD ANOTHER SENSITIVE SUBJECT- AT THE END THESE THINGS WILL COME AND GO AT IT IN THE DECADES WELL THAT'S SOMETHING FOR US TO TALK ABOUT AND DISCUSS AND SEE WHETHER IT SHOULD. APPLY TO THE SAME- ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS OF HOW SO THAT PARENTS CAN MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS SO. GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS BILL. AND. THE APPRECIATION TO THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR HER FOR TRYING TO FIND COMMON. AND A POLAR POLITICAL AND- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER COUNTY GOT THE FORM OF A MOTION THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE OKAY VERY GOOD SENATOR BOB DOLE I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE.

IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS ENCOURAGED POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS SUCH AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADOPT DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS WHAT SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS FOR DOING SO. UNDER CURRENT LAW EDUCATION CODE SECTION FIVE OH ONE NINE ALLOWS COUNTY COMMITTEES THAT OVERSEE SCHOOL DISTRICT ORGANIZATION. TO ESTABLISH TRUST ELECTIONS IN A PROMPT AND INCLUSIVE PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY FOR REASONS HAVING TO DO WITH HOW VARIOUS STATE STATUTES AND CODES INTERSECT. THE CURRENT CODE MAKES AN EXCEPTION FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF EDUCATION PROVIDED FOR IN THE CHARTER. OF THE CITY OR COUNTY. SCHOOL DISTRICT FITTING THIS DESCRIPTION ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO PUT ANY ORDINANCE AND ESTABLISHING TRUST YEAR ELECTIONS TO THE ELECTORS OF THEIR DISTRICT WHICH OFTEN RESULTS IN AN OFFICIAL LECTION AND SOMETIMES AN OFF CYCLE ELECTION AT SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE. TO THAT LOCALITY IN PRACTICE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN BYPASS THIS REQUIREMENT BUT SECURING A WAIVER FROM THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. THIS EXTRA STEP HOWEVER STILL ADDS TIME AND ADDITIONAL COSTS TO THE ADOPTION OF TRUST YEAR ELECTIONS AND THIS DELAY HAS RESULTED IN FURTHER AT LARGE ELECTIONS THAT ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE CVR RIGHT. THESE UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITIES CAN RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT UNLAWFUL AT LARGE ELECTIONS THAT PERPETUATE THE DILUTION OF MINORITY VOTERS IN VIOLATION OF EITHER THE SPIRIT OR THE LETTER. OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT SB FOUR FOUR TWO FIXES THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING ORDINANCES APPROVING A PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH DISTRICT. TRUSTEE AREAS TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON ADOPTION WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ACTION TO AFFIRM APPROVAL. UNDER THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THIS WOULD APPLY TO ALL ALL ELECTION REGARDING MEMBERS THAN ONE. TWENTY FIVE DAYS FOLLOWING ADOPTION. NO THAT WAS REMEMBER I TOOK AND EARLIER- COMMITTEE THANKS TO THE CHAIR OF THE LESS COMMITTEES WHO- WHO IS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. WITH THESE CHANGES SB FOUR FOUR TWO WILL STREAMLINE THE TRANSITION PROCESS WHILE ELIMINATING ADDITIONAL COSTS TO TAXPAYERS RESULTING FROM DELAYS. AND PROSPECTIVE LITIGATION THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ENNIS HAD NO OPPOSITION THUS FAR WITH ME VIRTUALLY TODAY. IS MICHELLE WERE SHOT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAIVER PROCESS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS MORNING.

VERY GOOD THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF THE BILL THANK YOU CENTER PAM SENATOR TROUBLED. I DO NOT EVEN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH- I APPRECIATE THE INTENT IN THE EFFORT ON ON ON ON THIS BILL I AM CONCERNED- WITH AREAS. OF MY DISTRICT ARE IN MY AREA MY DISTRICT WHERE WE HAVE VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES THE MOUNTAIN AREAS JUST AN EXAMPLE- WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND. CANDIDATES TO RUN FOR OFFICE AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITIES ARE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FOURTEEN THOUSAND- TO FIND TO PUT DISTRICTS IN THEM- I AM CONCERNED THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO REPRESENTATION WE END UP WITH VACANCIES AND IN SMALL. COMMUNITIES. AND I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR PRESENTED OF GOVERNMENT. AT ALL COSTS BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO- A STATE MANDATE. I THINK IN IN BROWN'S OF. THIS TYPE OF POLICY. IT IS BEST TO LET OUR LOCAL. DISTRICTS IN OUR AGENCIES DECIDE WHAT IS. OUT WHAT WOULD WORK MOST EFFICIENTLY TO HAVE GOVERNMENT- IN PLAY IN IN THOSE TYPE OF COMMUNITIES- AND SO I WOULD IN WITH THIS TYPE OF NOTICE I THINK AS YOU SAID. MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT CAN AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO WOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH DISTRICTS I KNOW WE DID- BUT IN AREAS WHERE THE POPULATION IS JUST VERY VERY SMALL. AND NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT SO IN PRINCIPLE I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA I THINK IN PRACTICE IT WOULD MAKE IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO ENACT THAT- OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ENACT SUCH A MEASURE- EITHER FOR WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. ON THIS MEASURE BUT I DO. TRULY DO APPRECIATE YOUR- AND YOUR EFFORT IN A AND PER THIS. I THANK YOU SENATOR CHOCOLATE LET ME MAKE CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS BILL THAT WOULD COMPEL A DISTRICT TO SWITCH THE BASIS FOR ITS ELECTIONS THIS BILL SIMPLY COVERS A VERY NARROW CARRIAGE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO WHO WHO'S WHO RESIDE IN CITIES OR COUNTIES THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR THAT ARE GOVERNED BY A CHARTER- AND SO ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IN THE EVENT. THAT THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MEETING THOSE CRITERIA SHIFT TO TRUSTEER ELECTIONS IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM TO DO SO- AND SAVES THEM THE COST OF AN ELECTION AND THE COSTS OF RESTRICTIVE LIMITATION TO BE VERY CLEAR WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT BUT IN THIS CASE WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO. RENDER CLARITY AND EFFICIENCY AROUND A VERY NARROW CARRIAGE THIS WOULD NOT APPLY TO BE A DUBBED AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD TO ANY THE DISTRICT'S YOU JUST DESCRIBED. OKAY SO THIS IS NOT A MANDATE THAT YOU WOULD FORCE EVERY EVERY ENTITY TO PURSUE SUCH A MATTER ABSOLUTELY THIS IS ONLY APPLIES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE INTENT ON SHIFTING TO AT LARGE TO FROM AT LARGE INTEREST YEAR ELECTIONS BUT WHOSE DISTRICTS ARE GOVERNED BY A CHARTER FOR EITHER THE CITY OR COUNTY- IN WHICH THEY SHOULD. OKAY WELL I THINK THAT CHANGE MY OPINION THE LADY SENATOR MICHAEL. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO SENATOR DOLLY. SO I'M A LITTLE TORN SO I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY TRYING TO DO AND I KNOW THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DRESS BUT WHO IT IS STATES TEN WHO CHOOSES THE VALERIE'S OF THE OF THE DISTRICT AND I THINK THAT IS WHERE- THIS IS HONING IN ON SO CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW WHO GETS TO CHOOSE THOSE. THOSE DISTRICTS TYPICALLY THE BOARD WOULD DO THAT- AND A LOT OF THAT CENTER DOLLARS WOULD. DEPEND ON HOW THAT PROCESS WAS EITHER INITIATED- OR OR OR UNDERTAKEN- BUT THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THE BILL THAT WOULD CHANGE THAT PROCESS- THAT FOR THE MOST PART IS A LOCAL PROCESS AND DONE THE IN CONSULTATION WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. IN EVENT THE SCHOOL THE DECIDE OF ITS OWN VOLITION TO THAT OR IN RESPONSE TO A DEMAND LETTER. OF YOU KNOW FOR CALIFORNIA RIGHT TO RIGHTS SIX SHOOT. BUT IT'S IN IN THAT RESPECT IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER DISTRICT. SO THERE'S NO ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GERRYMANDER THEN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT I MEAN I'VE BEEN SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN ELECTED HIM INTO. COUPLE SENSES IN TRYING TO DIVIDE UP. SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT GETS VERY POLITICAL ONE YOU CAN CARP SOMEBODY OUT OR KEEP SOMEBODY AND OR- AND THAT'S THAT'S THE POINT I WANTED YOU TO DRESS OUT I DO SHOULD ENTERTAIN TYPICALLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IF IT DISTRICT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO TRUST YEAR ELECTIONS. THEY WOULD SURELY DID KNOW. THE NEGOTIATOR WITHIN THE BOARD. TO ENGAGE A DEMOGRAPHER WHO WOULD THEN GUIDE THAT PROCESS YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS WOULD LOOK AT THE PERSPECTIVE LINES. AND THEN THERE'D BE. IS BUT PROCESS FOR COMMUNITY INPUT. YEAH YOU KNOW AND IN THE END YOU TO YOUR- IT. BUT DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S- THE SAME WAY AS- MOST OTHER. LINE REDRAWING THE STATE FOR THE MOST PART IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE FREE OF GERRYMANDERING. SO THERE'S NO SO THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY I MEAN ARE WE THINK ABOUT DISS. DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES INSIDE OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT IT NEED TO BE REPRESENTED ON THE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ALLOWING THE ABILITY BILL TO GERRYMANDER- SENATE I'VE HEARD. SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET LEFT OUT AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE. CHANGED THAT STATEWIDE WE WE'RE GOING TO RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST THERE'S THE CENSUS IS AND WE HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A BOARD TO TEST OUT WHICH I THINK IS VERY HEALTHY ACTUALLY. RICHARD SO YOU KNOW THAT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S EXTERNAL TO DO THIS BILL IN ITS INTENT. SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THIS BILL AS A WAY OF ENABLING A PROCESS. THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE OR THE TIMING. AB YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT WE'RE INTENDING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THAT IF AND WHEN I DISTRICT DECIDES TO MAKE THIS CHANGE- THAT THEY CAN DO SO. WITHOUT HAVING OF A SPECIAL ELECTION WHICH IS COSTLY. OR OR WITHOUT BEING YOU KNOW PUTTING THEMSELVES ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A OF A PROSPECTIVE SEVERE A LOT LAWSUIT. BUT BEYOND THAT YOU KNOW THIS THIS MAKES IT DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE HOW THOSE LINES WOULD BE DRAWN IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENT. THAN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. INTO THE WAIVER- OPPORTUNITIES SO THEY CAN WAY. TILL THEY CAN HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION WHICH- DRIVES THE COST DOWN ISWHAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CORRECT IT'S THE OPPOSITE THAT THE WAIVER OPPORTUNITY ALLOWS THEM TO NOT HAVE AN ELECTION. AND JUST DO THE DRAW THE DISTRICTS AN INCORRECT BUT YOU KNOW BUT BUILT TO THAT PROCESS IN SOME WAY THAT. YOU KNOW ISSUES AGREED UPON BY THE BY THE- GOVERNING BODY- BUT THEY WON'T HAVE TO THE END YOU KNOW TO THE ELECTION. SO THAT'S A WHERE LIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO JERRY MANNING IF THAT WAS A THAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT. WHAT'S REALLY YOU HAVE TO DRAW A LINE SENATOR DOLLY AND SO. YOU KNOW ONE MAN'S GERRYMANDERING ANOTHER MAN'S LINES RIGHT SO WE FACE THAT ISSUE EVERY TEN YEARS RIGHT FOR YOU KNOW FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- AND FOR THIS YOU KNOW YOU'RE MAKING A CHANGE BUT- TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT CHANGE. IS THIS IS TO ENABLE THE DECISION HAVING ALREADY BEEN MADE. TO BE EXECUTED IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T COST ADDITIONAL MONEY OR UNTIL ADDITIONAL TIME. BUT IT IT IT DOESN'T YOU KNOW IT IT HAS NO BEARING ON HOW THOSE LINES ARE DRAWN. SO I UNDER I GET THE- OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE THE RESOURCES BECAUSE IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO SPECIAL LOOKS UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I ALSO AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE YOU KNOW. THE DRAWING THE LINES IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IF A COMMUNITY IS LEFT OUT- AND THERE'S NOT SOME IT- ABILITY FOR FOLKS WHO CAN PROTEST THOSE LINES- IN THIS IS DONE BY THE BOARD THIS IS GIVING THEM THAT ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT THAT INPUT IF YOU'RE NOT LIMITED YOU TO IT IT'S NOT GOING TO JUST BE DONE BY THE BOARD IT'S GOING TO BE DONE BY THE BOARD IN SOME FASHION. THAT YOU KNOW THAT MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BY THE MEMBERS OF THAT BOARD BUT AGAIN THIS WILL ENABLE THE BOARD TO DO SO. WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL TIME MORE EXPENSIVE ELECTION SHOW- APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BY THIS BILL NO BEARING ON THAT LARGE. OF HOW LINES WILL BE DRAWN ON WHETHER NOT. YOU KNOW ONE PARTY WILL BE ABLE TO THE OTHER IN THE DRIVER'S LUNCH IT WILL NOT CREATE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR GERRYMANDERING. IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT IF AND WHEN HE DISTRICT MOVES TO AT LARGE ELECTIONS UNDER THE CVR RIGHT. IT WILL BE ALLOWED TO DO SO WITHOUT IT BEING EXPENSIVE OR PROSPECTIVELY. YOU KNOW BEING LITIGATED. I'M I'LL I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GO I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY GET SORT OF THE RIGHT WAYS I'M ONLY OFF TODAY AND- DIG A LITTLE DEEPER SO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS OF THE- YOUR QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD AND YES CENTER CORTESE. YES- TO THE AUTHOR CENTER NEWMAN AYE I THINK IT'S- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN AN EXCELLENT BILL BUT THEN I COME FROM A COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HAS AN AT LARGE. SET OF ELECTIONS SO WITH A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND VOTERS IN I'M SURE IF THERE WAS AN EASIER WAY AND THEY WERE QUALIFIED UNDER THIS PARTICULAR A STATUTORY CHANGE- THERE'D BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT. A POTENTIALLY CHANGING THAT TO ONCE AND FOR ALL AND THUS REDUCING THE COSTS ARE FOR THINGS LIKE BALLOT STATEMENTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT COME ALONG- WHICH ARE REALLY BARRIERS TO THE PEOPLE- YOU KNOW GETTING THEMSELVES ON THE BALLOT AND CONSOLES HEARD RIGHT NOW IN. IN SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS I DON'T KNOW IF THIS COVERS ALL OF THAT OR THE OFTEN WOULD SOLVE SOME OF THAT BUT I THINK IT'S A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF- WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE- IT MAY BE SOME. THAT'S BUILT ON FURTHER IN THE FUTURE AND- I'D BE. HAPPY TO COME ON AS A CO AUTHOR IF. YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL OBVIOUSLY THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT SENATORS ARE GOING TO HAVE IS GOING TO THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE ANY OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TO HAVE EMOTIONAL EXCUSE BUT WE HAVE A MOTION.

SEN RUBIO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. ONE GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING ALL THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS TODAY I AM VERY PROUD TO PRESENT SB SEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH WILL HELP CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND BUILT A STUDENT TO TEACHER PIPELINE BY ESTABLISHING THAT CALIFORNIA LEADS. LEADERSHIP EXCELLENCE ACADEMIC DIVERSITY SERVICE LEARNING STATEWIDE TUTORING PROGRAM FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE. STUDENTS THIS BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW COLLEGE STUDENTS TO EARN CREDIT CDC WILL PROVIDE THE GUIDELINES ON THE PROGRAM BUT THE PROGRAM WILL BE FACILITATED BY THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND HAVE THE OPTION TO PARTICIPATE IF THEY CHOOSE ONCE AGAIN THIS IS AN OPT IN PROGRAM. NOT A MANDATE SINCE I'VE ARRIVED IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT'S VERY CLEAR EDUCATION IS MY PASSION THEY WAS MY LIFE AND CONTINUES TO BE IN SO MANY WAYS SO IS MY PRIORITY TO FIGURE OUT A PROGRAM THAT CAN HELP US. BRING OUR STUDENTS UP TO SPEED AND REALLY FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGES THAT TEACHERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PROVIDE TUTORING SERVICE WITHIN THE SCHOOL DAY. THERE ARE MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING ACADEMICALLY AND NEED THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AFTER HOURS WHICH AGAIN AS A TEACHER I CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT BOB TUTORING IS NEVER ENOUGH HOURS IN THE DAY TO HELP THE STUDENTS AND SO I WAS A REPEAT READING TEACHER FOR MANY YEARS AND I. USED TO STRUGGLE WITH THAT AND I USED TO ALWAYS SAY IF I ONLY HAD JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME BUT THERE WAS NEVER ENOUGH TIME DURING THE DAY. IN ADDITION TO THE LEARNING LOSS IN GENERAL WE NOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE LEARNING LOSS OF COVERAGE NINETEEN AND HOW IT HAS AFFECTED AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF STUDENTS AND- AGAIN AS A TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THE GAP WILL ONLY GROW EXPONENTIALLY IF WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT TEACHERS. NEED TO HELP THEM GET THEIR- THIRTY. SUGGEST THAT AND NUMBER OF TO ARE PER BELOW GRADE LEVEL ALREADY. THE POLICY ANALYSIS FOR THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION FOUND THAT STUDENTS IN FOURTH TO TENTH GRADE EXPERIENCE. LEARNING LOSS BOTH IN MATH AND ENGLISH. AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS WHAT ARE YOUR GRADES EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEARNING LOSS IT'S TRUE THAT IN ELEMENTARY AND LOWER GRADES HE REALLY JUST LEARN HOW TO READ. AND TO AND THE BASICS LATER GREAT SPEECHES HELP YOU EXPAND ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE SO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL IS WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS PROGRAM. THAT WILL HELP WITH THAT EIGHT TWENTY SIXTEEN HARVARD STUDY FOUND THAT ONE ON ONE TUTORING WAS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING YOUR TREATMENT. OF LOW PERFORMING STUDENTS OF ALL ALL OTHER EFFORTS BUT AS A SEVENTEEN YEAR VETERAN TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU WITH CERTAINTY WITHOUT THE STUDY THAT IT IS CHIRLA. THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY PROVIDES A CENTRALIZED FRAMEWORK AND TOOL FOR THE STATE TO USE BY PROVIDING TUTORING SERVICES TO STUDENTS WHO NEED IT THE MOST ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE CHILDREN. THAT COME FROM ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED HOMES AND MOST OFTEN THEY WILL NOT SEEK BILLS ARE TOURING SERVICE OUTSIDE ON THEIR OWN. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE CERTIFICATION- IN THE QUALITIES EXISTED PRIOR TO COLD AND THEY HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED QUITE FRANKLY HOWEVER NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC THIS IS REALLY CLEAR AND HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AND SO WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON TRYING TO PROVIDE THESE TYPES OF SERVICES. THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IS NOW WHEN WE HAVE THE MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS WEBSITE SUCH HIGH LEVEL OF LEARNING LOSS. AND I WANT TO ALSO BE VERY CLEAR FOR EVERYONE HERE THAT THIS BILL IS A SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAM. IT IS AFTER SCHOOL HOURS AND WILL NOT TAKE AWAY ANY JOBS OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANYONE ALREADY IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IT'S MEANT TO SUPPLEMENT ONLY. AND I WILL REPEAT IT TOO OFTEN PROGRAM SO ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN OFTEN NOT UP TO- 'M SORRY TUESDAY TO PARTICIPATE IF THEY FEEL THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE DISRUPTED SEVEN. SO AGAIN. NOT ONLY WILL THIS BE CRITICAL TO- CLOTHING A CHIEF GAS BUT A WOULD ALSO SEE. THIS TO TEACHER PIKE. WHEN NICE STORE THINKING OF PRO I ALSO THOUGHT- BEING AT A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR AND HOW I HAD A TEACHER WHO STARTED TEACHING AND LYFT WITHIN THREE MONTHS REALIZE HE JUST WASN'T FOR HER AFTER INVESTING SO MUCH TIME ENERGY MONEY AND EDUCATION. THREE MONTHS IT'S ALL IT TOOK FOR HER TO REALIZE IT JUST WASN'T A CAREER PATH SHE WANTED TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE SOME OF THIS PROGRAM REALLY GIVES TEACHERS AND THOSE ASPIRING TEACHERS TEACHER CANDIDATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY WORK WITH STUDENTS AND KIDS IN AND SEE IF THIS IS SOMETHING THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE. I HOPE THAT IT DOES AND IT'S FAR IS A LOT MORE TEACHERS AND A LOT MORE PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE PROFESSION. SOUGHT TODAY WITH ME I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO FIND ME AT TWO WITNESSES ONE SHE IS RUDY GAY YOU'LL SHE'S A TEACHER AND SPEECH PATHOLOGIST AT DM SETTLEMENT HE'S GOING BALLPARK SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I ALSO HAVE WITH ME DONNA.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING TENER LEYVA AND THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AS I SAID MY NAME IS DON OR TO GIVE. I'M HERE AS AN EDUCATION ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA IN STRONG SUPPORTER SB SEVEN TWENTY THREE. I'M A FORMER TEACHER OF NEARLY THIRTY YEARS AND A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER DAN HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE PGA AS A PARENT AND A GRANDPARENT. THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA SUPPORTS LEGISLATION THAT CAN IMPROVE THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL STUDENTS AND ELIMINATE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE ALL STUDENTS WITH EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. AND WHEN NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES. AND REMEDIATION PROGRAMS TO ENSURE ACADEMIC SUCCESS. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A TUTORING PROGRAM THAT WILL BE A TREMENDOUS BOON TO STUDENTS K. TWELVE WHO HAVE BEEN HIGHLY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. PARENTS ARE WORRIED. MS ARE STRUGGLING. ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE LEARNING LOSSES WHICH HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DETRIMENT TO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN. THE VISUAL TUTORING HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUCCEEDING ACADEMICALLY. INDIVIDUAL TUTORING THAT ONE TO ONE TOUCH WITH A TUTOR CAN REACH OUT TO AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND FIND OUT WHAT IS THE ISSUE WHY IS A STUDENT STRUGGLING WHAT KIND OF SPECIFIC HELP IS NECESSARY IT'S LIKE A MAGIC TOUCH. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MEET WITH STUDENTS INDIVIDUALLY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS OFTEN WHEN I WAS TEACHING. IT'S LIKE OPENING A WINDOW AND SEEING THE HORIZON FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME- NOW I SEE WHY YOU ARE BEHIND NOW I UNDERSTAND YOUR PROBLEM LET'S TRY THIS. AND IT WORKS IT GIVES STRUGGLING STUDENTS A CHANCE TO GROW IN WAYS THEY DIDN'T REALIZE WERE POSSIBLE. WE A STUDENT IS WANTED TO. A TUTOR DISK THIS. PROBLEM A CHILD IS HAVING UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING TO CONVENTICLES LANDED IN A WAY THAT THE CHILD FROM GRASS. YES INDIVIDUAL TUTORING IS ESSENTIAL ALSO I REALLY APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT THE WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBLE SHOOTERS MENTIONED IN THIS BILL. STUDENTS YES RETIRED TEACHERS LIKE ME GONZALEZ DONIGER PASTOR TEN MINUTES. CAN YOU WRAP UP PLEASE- INCLUSION WE URGE YOU TO PASS THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT.

CENTER BORRERO ON BEHALF OF CSEA AND WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND I APOLOGIZE TO THE COMMITTEE AND OF THE AUTHOR FOR LATE OPPOSITION WERE OPPOSED BECAUSE THIS TYPE OF TUTORING SHOULD BE PERFORMED BY TEACHERS OR PARA EDUCATORS A RECENT SURVEY OF DOZENS OF STUDIES FROM MIT DETERMINES TUTORING PROGRAMS USING TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAY TO IMPROVE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. THIS IS WHY AB EIGHTY SIX ALLOCATED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRIGGERING THE PHYSICALLY PERFORMED BY CERTIFICATED AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES TO DRESS CODE BUT NINETEEN LEARNING WHAT COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH POTENTIALLY NO TEACHING EXPERIENCE SHOULD NOT PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT ALSO FEATURES WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT EMPLOYEES OF THE DISTRICT. COPA'S REQUESTING AN AMENDMENT TO SPECIFY THAT THE TUTORS ARE EITHER CERTIFICATED OR CLASSIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES TO ENSURE THE BEST. OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. I WILL GO ROOM FOR TWO OF THEIR ANY. SEEING NONE WILL GO TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY SEEING NONE MISTER MODERATOR CAN YOU QUEUE UP ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB SEVEN TWO THREE.

ADAM SURE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS ARE QUEUING UP. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MR MODERATOR ALL RIGHT WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR PAM. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SIR RUBIO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BILL I DID HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DRESS- IN ANALYSIS THEY DID. RAISE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT- THE FUNDING FROM AB EIGHTY SIX AND THIS PROPOSAL- SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS NOT SEEKING TO TAP INTO THE FUNDING THAT WE FROM THE- THAT WE RE ALLOCATED- THROUGH OUR BELIEF EARLY BUDGET ACTIONS. SO YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT AND HOW ALSO- YOUR BILL IS CORRECT COORDINATE WITH WHAT WAS AN EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX IN TERMS OF THE- OTHER TUTORING PROGRAM SO I KNOW THAT YOU SAID THIS IS IN ADDITION TO BUT- JUST. HOW THE TO MY INTERFACE OR NOT AND JUST AND ALSO CLARITY ON THE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR PAT FOR- FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION AND SO I KNOW THAT AB AT SIX ALLOCATED A LOT OF FUNDING FOR SPECIFICALLY FOR TUTORING EXTENDED LEARNING TIME SUMMER SCHOOL AND THE LIKES AND SO THIS BILL DOES NOT INTENT TO TOUCH ANY OF THAT FUNDING. BY AND I'VE STRESSED AND I WILL RESTRUCTURED- MY HOPE IS THAT WE COULD SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE NEED IS GOING TO BE GREAT. AND I UNDERSTAND THE FEAR OF SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AND WHAT THEY CALLED AND I YOU KNOW I HEARD THAT TEACHERS AND CERTIFICATED ARE BEST QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE THESE TUTORING SERVICES ABSOLUTELY AGREE A TEACHER. WHO TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS AT DISTRICT AND SYSTEM- WE CAN NEVER HAPPEN THAT. WE CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TRYING TO HELP BUT YOU KNOW AFTER HOURS AFTER SCHOOL AND THE CHALLENGE WE'RE HAVING TO IS THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS THAT STILL WANT TO TAKE ON TUTORING AFTER HOURS I MEAN THAT'S- AS A TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT WAS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE I MEAN YOU'RE EXHAUSTED YOU'RE TIRED YOU'RE TRYING TO PRODUCE. OFTEN TELL YOU'RE TRYING OUT TUTOR. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE BEFORE SCHOOL DURING RECESS LUNCH WE DON'T HAVE RESEARCH WE CAN HAVE LUNCH. THAT WAS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I'M NOT SPEAKING TO SPEAKING FOR ME. BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GRAB OPPORTUNITIES TEND TO HELP THESE KIDS. BUT THE HOURS DURING THE DAY ARE NEVER AND NOT STILL I DO I GUESS THAT THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO TOUCH THAT FINDING OUT ALL. THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO. DISPLACE ANY TEACHER ANY CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE ANYBODY THAT'S ALREADY WORKING WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND WHEN YOU SAY HOW IS THIS GOING TO WORK- AT BOTH PROGRAMS. BOB THAT IS WHY ISN'T OFTEN PROGRAM. IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DOING FINE AND READY IS UP I'M YOU KNOW GETTING ALL THE TUTORING THE ME. THEY DON'T HAVE TO OPT IN. BUT I THINK IT'S UP TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DECIDE TO WE NEED THE HELP OR NOT AND JUST HAVING THIS THERE AS A TOOL THAT THEY CAN USE. YOU KNOW I THINK IT IT'S JUST THAT JUST ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX IT'S NOT A MANDATE. AS FAR AS THE FUNDING WE ARE STILL EXPLORING THE FUNDING SOURCE SO IT'S- OPINION APPROPRIATION BUT THIS WILL NOT BE THE SOURCE OF FUNDING WE INTEND TO USE. AT ALL SUCH AS WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT SO- YEAH I THINK THAT- THE- NIGHT AIR G. TO TALK TO THE OPPOSITION WHICH I KNOW CAME IN LATER IN THE EVENING OF MADE IT OUT SO- IN ALL FAIRNESS TO YOU- THAT THAT. JOB DATE AND- SHARE WITH YOU THEIR CONCERNS EARLIER ON- CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SIMPLY AS A TEACHER WHO KNOWS THE FIELD WELL AND KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF CYRUS SCHOOL EMPLOYEES I'M SURE TO YOU'LL REACH OUT TO THEM NOW THAT THEY'VE EXPRESSED HER CONCERNS AND- HOPEFULLY CAN WORK THOSE OUT CERTAINLY I WILL. I'LL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BUT I ALSO. HOPE THAT- AND I NOTE THAT- WE CAN SORT OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY'VE RAISED- DO AGAIN APPRECIATE THAT ESPECIALLY WITH BECAUSE OF IT AND THE TREMENDOUS DEMANDS- THAT. WE'RE PLACING DOWN BOTH TEACHERS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THAT- THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ALSO GET THEM SOME OF. THE L. TEMPER INSTITUTIONAL- AND ALSO. CAN YOU PERSUADE SOME . TO ENTER INTO. FIELD WELL THROUGH THE THROUGH. UNDER X. THAT MY BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL WELL SO. I PREFER WHEN YOU TRY TO DO THINK SO MUCH CENTER. DR PAN AM ONE DISCUSS ADDRESS THAT SOUGHT TO BE. THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH I HEARD ABOUT THE OPPOSITE THIS MORNING AT AND UP TO NOW. I DON'T KNOW THEY WERE OPPOSE SO I WOULD I HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS PRIOR TO COMING TO YOU. BUT FOR THOSE LISTENING I WANT THEM TO KNOW I'M ON THEIR SIDE I'M ON THEIR TEAM I'M TRYING TO MAKE THEIR JOBS. EASIER AND DIE AND JUST TRYING AGAIN SUPPLEMENT AND I WILL WORK WITH THEM ABSOLUTELY WE CAN. DEFINITELY. CLARIFY SOME OF THAT THE CONCERNS. EIGHT SENATOR GLAZERS YOUR QUESTION CALM. PLEASE WELL I THINK THE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE KIDS- SHE CONTINUE TO GUIDE ALL THAT WE DO HERE- AT FOCUSED ON THEIR SITUATION- SENATOR I SO APPRECIATE YOUR BACKGROUND YOUR TEACHING EXPERIENCE AND THE INSIGHTS THAT YOU BRING TO OUR WORK HERE AND- CERTAINLY- IT'S REFLECTED IN THE BILL THAT YOU BROUGHT BEFORE US TODAY- THAT IS THE ISSUE LEARNING LOSS IT'S PROFOUNDLY- WORRISOME- AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL OF MY SOUL. ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE TO SURVIVE THIS PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SCARS AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUING CHALLENGES. AHEAD AT ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE IT'S CERTAINLY FOR OUR KIDS I'D CERTAINLY FOR- THE THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE FACED SO YOUR BILL IS MORE TIMELY THAN I COULD EVER EVER BE IN THIS SPACE HOW DO WE HELP THEM CATCH UP. AND HOWDO WE MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE PERFECT HOW WE LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING REALLY DONE CAN GET IN THE WAY OF ACTUALLY JUST TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO LIFT YOUR KIDS UP AND HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN HELP OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY- IN ANYWAY THEY CAN. THAT YOUR BILL IS RESPONSIVE TO- INDIVIDUAL CHOICES THAT THERE MAY BE OUT THERE WITH THE OPT IN PROVISION- I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER IS THAT THE STATE ALICE'S NOTES THAT WE HAVE IN SOME INCREDIBLE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS IN OUR STATE- AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE FAIR TO GIVE THEM THE SAME ELIGIBILITY. HOW YOUR BILL TO ADVANCE TO BE SIGNED AND FUNDING TO BE AVAILABLE TO OPT IT AS WELL AND ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT AND I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND UNDER CLOSE TONIGHT- TO SPEAK TO THAT WE WILL BE INCLUDING CHARTER. SCHOOLS AS WELL THAT WAS. AB IN OVERSIGHT SO ON IN THE NEXT. WILL THE BILL TO INCLUDE THE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO CORTE. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE- I APPRECIATED THE TO THE APPROPRIATE YOUR- EXCHANGE WITH SENATOR PAN OF. REGARDING. THE AB EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS AND- THE INTERFACE OF THE PROGRAMS THE- IT JUST IT STRUCK ME AND I ACTUALLY- JUST GOING OVER PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS SIX OF SEVEN IT SAYS ON THE TOP OF MY- PACKET HERE- HE THEY WERE SORT OF MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS REYES AROUND THOSE ISSUES SO I APPRECIATE YOU- RESPOND TO THAT IS AND ALSO. INDICATING THAT IT'S AN AFTER SCHOOL WHAT KIND OF A PROGRAM. I TRIED TO INTEND TO- CASSON I BOOKED IT FOR YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I DO ALSO THINK BERMAN ESPECIALLY AFTER. AND IF YOU'RE SERVING AS AS ASCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND BRINGING ON- MENTORING PROGRAMS MENTORING PROGRAMS FROM THE YOU KNOW BALLING CBO'S IN THE COMMUNITY- OTHER KINDS OF VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS THAT IT OF COURSE GETS A LITTLE BIT TRICKY WHERE EVERY OF CLUB COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS IN PLACE- TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES. A DISCUSSION TAKES PLACE SOMETIMES IT CAN BE JUST AS SIMPLE MEET AND CONFER AND SOMETIMES THERE MAY BE SOMETHING IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT ALREADY THAT THAT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT- IN A JUST WANTED TO FLAG THAT. BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT. INTENDS TO AUGMENT LIKE YOU SAY SORT OF WITH HUMAN RESOURCES- IN A TIME OF NEED AND THEN HAVE IT RUNNING INTO- ALL KINDS OF CONFLICT IN IN THE DISTRICTS HIMSELF UP THIRTY DISTRICTS IN. A BASICALLY IN MY SENATE DISTRICT IN EACH ONE OF THEM HAS. A SEPARATE- SOMETIMES THE SAME UNITS BUT AS YOU ARE QUITE AWARE A SEPARATE UNITS THAT. ALL HAVE THEIR OWN SEPARATE AGREEMENTS THE COUNTY OFFICE CAN'T REALLY CONTROL ANY OF THAT PER SE- SO ANYTHING YOU CAN DO IN THE BILL GOING FORWARD TO. ARTICULATE PROCESS THEY'RE ON THE UP ON THE OPPORTUNITY THINK IT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY IF THEY OPT IN THEN THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND. THAT IF THEY HAVE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THOSE- BUT I SUSPECT THAT- PUT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT DIRECTION ARTICULATION IN THE BILL IF YOU'RE SO WILLING- YOU KNOW BETWEEN NOW AND- WHEN IT SIGNED INTO LAW- WOULD WOULD HELP. FOR SMOOTHER LANDING- YOU KNOW WHEN THE STAR TRYING TO IMPLEMENT ARE OFTEN AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL AGAIN AND I'M JUST I'M JUST SHARING. THE CONCERN I THINK IT'S SORT PERHAPS SIMILAR TO. A CENTER PEONS CONCERN PLEASE BUT WITH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HE ASKED- AND EVEN- EVEN IN THE MOST- YOU KNOW SORT OF STRAIGHT FORWARD OBVIOUS SENSE AGAIN GOING BACK TO PAGE SIX IF YOU'RE USING IT AT ALL TO STAND UP THE PROGRAM- AB EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS OR PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS FOR THAT MATTER AS WE ALL KNOW TYPICALLY THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SORT OF- SOME SORT OF A GO SHE ATION THAT TAKES PLACE IN IN. IN ANY GUARDRAILS OR GUIDANCE THAT THE BILL COULD GIVE THIS TO HOW. HOW AND WHEN THAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE BECAUSE- IS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IT BEING VERY SUCCESSFUL SO- THANK YOU- APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS A SAID A SOMEBODY WHO'S- MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE MENTORING PROGRAMS THAT ARE BROUGHT IN. MUCH IN THE SAME WAY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS- IN MY HOMETOWN SO I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH RICHARD WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND AGAIN I WILL CAST MY VOTE TODAY.

SOME HELP FOR THE WE DON'T KNOW THE IMPACTS OF WHAT CODE IS DONE AND- WE WON'T REALLY SEE THAT UNTIL MAYBE YEARS LATER BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK IS THE TIME TO STRIKE I THINK THIS. IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT WILL HELP THOSE STUDENTS- PROBABLY NOT THIS YEAR BUT HOPEFULLY IN THE FALL WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT SO I SUPPORT YOUR BILL I KNOW THERE'S SOME. OBVIOUSLY THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND HOW IT REALLY GETS LAID OUT I KNOW YOU'LL YOU'LL BE PASSIONATE ABOUT WORKING OUT SO I'M IS FOR YOUR BILL TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT ON THE FLOOR SOON HOPEFULLY.

SACRAMENTO RICHARD COLLEAGUES- THANK YOU TO YOUR AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. I WILL BE. GLADLY ACCEPTING ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU SIR. YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR- OF THE ATTORNEYS APPEARING IN CASES THAT OUR COURT ROOMS AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE JUDGES WHO WERE HEARING THOSE CASES ARE OFTEN. QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE APPEARING IN FRONT OF THEM. FRANKLY THERE'S A DIVERSITY GAP IN THIS BILL WILL HELP CLOSE THE DIVERSITY GAP THAT CONTINUES TO PERSIST. THIS LACK OF DIVERSITY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS EQUITABLE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION OR AT LEAST THE PERCEPTION. OF EQUITABLE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND ACCESS THROUGHOUT OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM HOWEVER THERE IS AN EXISTING AND SUCCESSFUL. STATEWIDE INITIATIVE OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OUR OTHER. SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES THAT ADDRESSES THIS DIVERSITY ISSUE BY BUILDING A DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL PIPELINE FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO LAW SCHOOL. CALLED THE LAW. PATHWAYS PROGRAM ASMAN AND SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVEN ZERO WILL HELP EXPAND THIS MODEL TYPE PLAN AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN PATHWAYS TO THE LAW PROFESSION. SO WHILE THE BILL SPEAKS TO IMPROVING DIVERSITY IN THE LAW PROFESSION IN OUR COURT ROOMS IN THE ANALYSIS IN THE BILL ITSELF COVERS THAT. AND THE BILL CERTAINLY WILL DO THAT. AT ITS CORE THIS BILL ADVANCES A PROGRAM THAT FRANKLY REACHES DOWN INTO OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND SCHOOLS WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO PICK THE CURIOSITY OF STUDENTS. WITH REGARD TO A CAREER IN THE LAW AND TO PROVIDE A COORDINATED PATHWAY FOR THOSE STUDENTS FROM HIGH SCHOOLS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS TO LAW SCHOOL AND ULTIMATELY TO A GOOD PAYING JOB. AND A CAREER IN THE LAW. FOR SOME.

IT WAS THE CONNECTION I HD IN ITS PROGRAM I WROTE MY LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION HELPED ME PICK MY CLASSES ONE OF MY MAJOR. IT WAS THESE CONNECTIONS I WOULD CHECK UP ON THE EVERY FEW MONTHS TO ENSURE THAT I WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK YOU GET A LAW SCHOOL. YOU SEE THE PATHWAY DID NOT EXIST WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE SO I HAD TO PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER MYSELF. AND IT WAS THE RESOURCES I HAD FOR THE PROGRAM WHICH I RELIED ON HEAVILY THAT ENSURING MY SUCCESS. I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE IT TO LAW SCHOOL WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM IT WAS THE SAME CONNECTIONS I WROTE MY LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION CRAPPIE FROM MY ENTRANCE INTERVIEWS. THAT GAVE ME TIPS AND TRICKS BEFORE THE SCHOOL YEAR STARTED ABOUT HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND CHECK ON YOU ALONG THE WAY. SACRAMENTO I HAD AS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL JUDGE JUDY JOHNSON GAVE ME MY FIRST SUMMER JOB AFTER MY FIRST YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL WORKING AT HER CHAMBERS. THE FACT THAT I HAD FAMILIARITY WITH THE JUDGMENT ABLE TO WORK WITH HER HAS SET ME APART FROM MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. I OWE THAT TO THE PATHWAY PROGRAM. AND INVESTMENT IN THIS PROGRAM ALSO MEANS THAT INVESTMENT THAT COMES FULL CIRCLE I WILL BE A MENTOR FOR THIS PROGRAM AFTER TAKING THE BAR IN JULY I'VE ALREADY RECRUITED MY LAW SCHOOL. FRIENDS AND I TELL EVERY ATTORNEY I COME ACROSS ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND THEY HAVE ALWAYS EXPRESSED HOW THEY ACT SEARCH FOR PROGRAM JUST LIKE THIS ONE TO GET INVOLVED.

AB IS FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER SENATOR JOE BUG. CENTER OUT THEY REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL- VERY MUCH AND FOR THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED BY OUR COLLEAGUES IN BY THE STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE EARLIER. I JUST HAD A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO ACCESSIBILITY- ON BEHALF OF PARTICIPATION FOR THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR COLLEGES. HOW WERE THEY SELECTED AND WOULD IT BE OPEN TO OTHER SCHOOLS BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO OTHER SCHOOLS OBVIOUSLY. OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THIS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO REALLY IT'S BEEN HANDLED BY VOLUNTEERS AND OTHERS ON A PRO BONO BASIS PRIMARILY WHICH IS WHY THE FOUNDATION WAS ORIGINALLY INVOLVED WE'RE TRYING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THIS. INSTITUTIONALIZE ISN'T BUILT ON THE PROGRAM TO DEVELOP CAPACITY THE SCHOOLS ARE SELECTED BY LOOKING AT DEMOGRAPHICS TO TRY TO PICK THOSE SCHOOLS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY REACH. IN THOSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES STUDENTS WHO MAY NEVER KNOW ABOUT PROGRAMS LIKE THIS WHO MAY NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO GAIN THE EDUCATION TO OBTAIN THE TYPE OF GOOD PAYING JOBS AND CAREERS SUCH AS CAREERS IN THE LAW THEIR OTHER PATHWAY PROGRAMS AS WELL THIS ONE. JUST HAS TO DO PARTICULARLY WITH THE LAW BUT WE LOOK TO SCHOOLS WERE- IN DEMOGRAPHICALLY CHALLENGED COMMUNITIES WHERE THEIR- UNDERSERVED STUDENTS TO TRY. TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO GIVE THEM OPTIONS- SUCH AS THE- ARE. BY WITNESS. BUT TODAY THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION. I GUESS. MOST AND I KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROACTIVE- REACH FROM THE FOUNDATION IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REACH COULD ACCESS OR COULD REACH OUT IN IN CONSIDERATION OF BEING A PARTICIPANT ABSOLUTELY AND THIS IS NOT A FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A PATHWAY PROGRAM. IN WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY RIGHT NOW AND I WANT I CAN SPEAK TO IS THE WAY THOSE SCHOOLS WERE SELECTED AND THEY DID LOOK FOR SCHOOLS AND- IN THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NEVER HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THERE IS ABSOLUTELY. AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADD SCHOOLS AND EXPAND IN FACT THAT'S THE PURPOSE. IT ONCE WE GET TO THE FISCAL COMMITTEE FOR ABLE TO GET THE MONEY THAT'S THE PURPOSE FOR THE MONEY IS TO BUILD CAPACITY. TO TAKE THIS TO OTHER SCHOOLS TO OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO OTHER. HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CONNECT THEM WITH ADDITIONAL FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING. THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND TO EXPAND THE PROGRAMS THERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO. IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY TO THE EXTENT THERE'S NOT ONE THERE AND I'M NOT CERTAIN- AND OTHER COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE.

BUT WE ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE ADDITION OF SOME GUARD RAILS AND SOME ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE DEALING WITH STRESS. AND MAKING IT CLEAR WHEN AND HOW THE BUREAU CAN'T RAISE OR DECREASE THE STRESS. EARLIER THIS YEAR WE HAD A SITUATION WHERE IT ENDED UP BEING A RETROACTIVE SHE- FOR THE STUDENTS AND I THINK WE CAN AVOID THAT. AND THEN FINALLY AS WE ALL KNOW THE BUREAU HAS. OFFERED SOME SIGNIFICANT INCREASES WE APPRECIATE THOSE ARE NOT IN THIS BILL- BUT I DO EXPECT DIALOGUE ON THAT GOING FORWARD. AND NOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH EVERYBODY AS.
