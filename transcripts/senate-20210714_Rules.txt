BY PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST WHEN WE DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS. I ALSO WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR THEIR SYSTEMS DURING HIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT WHY I A SOUGHT OUT THIS PARTICULAR POSITION SO I WAS THE CHIEF OF THE OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY. IT IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK TO AN I. T. COMMUNITY THAT I HAVE BEEN SERVING ALONG SIDE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. I'M IN THOSE THIRTY YEARS I HAVE SERVED IN EIGHT INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS AND HAVE FOCUSED ON MODERNIZING THEIR TECHNOLOGY MISSIONS. AND IN THIS- OPPOSITE THIS ROLE I'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO SERVE THREE HUNDRED PLUS ANY LOCAL AND STATE DEPARTMENTS. MY HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO FOCUS ON THE GOALS AND THE CHALLENGES LAID OUT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE STRATEGIC PLAN. BY DELIVERING SECURE OPTIMIZED DEPENDABLE TECHNOLOGY SERVICES TO THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF LEADING A GROUP LED TEAM OF TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS WHERE OUR PURPOSE IS TO BE A TRUSTED ADVISER AS DEPARTMENT PUBLIC SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WANT TO ADVANCE AND SECURE THEIR TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVE THEIR CONSTITUENTS. I AM COMMITTED TO DELIVERING INNOVATION WITH PURPOSE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IN THE END THE DAY WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE CITIZENS AND THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA.

AS WE LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO- SHARE LOOK FOR SHARED SERVICES INNOVATIONS AND BUILD UP RIGHT. AND DIGITAL FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT CONCLUDES MY OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND WITH THAT SENATOR LAYERED I WILL START WITH YOU ON DISAPPOINTING. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATED THE CHANCE TO- MEET WITH THE APPOINTEE I THINK SHE ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND- DEMONSTRATED- A GOOD LEVEL OF COMPETENCE I'M GOING TO BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT FOR. I JUST MAYBE ONE ONE QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT AND THAT WAS JUST- THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH VERY LARGE PROJECTS THAT- YOU KNOW I HAVE TROUBLE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND THEN HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS A LOT OF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. THAT ARE LOCATED IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND WHERE PEOPLE EVEN HAVE DIFFERENT. LEVELS OF SKILL FOR NEEDS AND- ARE YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE IN OUR TALK WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HERE THE CHALLENGES IN BATON AND HOW YOU WOULD PROPOSE JUST AS PART OF YOUR JOB TO MEET THEM. RIGHT OKAY SENATOR LEAHY- SO ONE OF THINGS I BELIEVE IT IS OPTIMIZING PROCESSES BEFORE AUTOMATING PROCESSES- AND MANY TIMES WHEN WE HAVE CHALLENGES IT'S LOOKING THAT TECHNOLOGY IS THE- IS THE IS THE SILVER BULLET THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE BUSINESS PROBLEM SO I FIRST LOOK AT WHEN WE'RE DEPLOYING CHANGE AN ORGANIZATION OR LOOKING AT LARGE PROJECTS- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT KNOWLEDGE AN ORGANIZATION TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO A LOT OF TIMES IT'S PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BROUGHT RIGHTS BUSINESS SPONSORSHIP AND THAT WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE OF WHERE OUR PROCESS NEEDS TO BE ON BEHALF OF THE RESIDENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AUTOMATING AND THAT WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY SOMETIMES WE HAVE THE DESIRED CHANGE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY THATWE'RE WILLING TO DO THE HARD WORK NECESSARY- AND- ALSO LOOKING AT CHANGE AND INCREMENTAL I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO DELIVER INCREMENTAL WINS VERSUS STATE BANK- AND TECHNOLOGY FOR A LONG TIME. WAITING FIVE YEARS FOR FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANY OF US HAVE PATIENTS TO DO AND WE BELIEVE THAT BY PUTTING THESE THINGS AND MODULES THAT WE ARE DELIVERING GOOD FUNCTIONALITY TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS IT SHOWS- YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE BUILDING UPON OUR SUCCESSES AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT I THINK IT'S ALSO AS I WAS TALKING ABOUT INNOVATION WITH PURPOSE IS EXTREMELY. IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T FORGET WHO WE SERVE- WHEN I WAS A CORRECTIONAL HEALTHCARE WE WERE MAKING SURE THAT- WHEN I CAME TO THE NURSES THE DOCTORS ALLIED HEALTH SERVICES IT'S A PART OF MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE DELIVERING INNOVATION THAT IS IMPROVING THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES- TO- THIS CASE IT WAS IN MY PATIENTS AND AS WE TALKED CENTER LAYERED I BELIEVE WALKING A MILE IN OUR CUSTOMERS SHOES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AS WELL AS SOMETIMES AGAIN NOT JUST FOCUSING ON THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ACTUALLY WALKING. OUT INTO- I WALKED EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE. I ALSO GO KIND OF LIKE SETTING UP A DAY THE LIFE YOU ARE SO SIDE BY SIDE WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO. IMPLEMENTED INSURANCE. HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY UTILIZING- PROCESSES SO THAT YOU'RE AUTOMATING ALIGNED TO WHAT THEY NEED. ONE OF THE THINGS I NOTICED WHEN I WALKED OUT INTO AN INSTITUTION WE HAD RECENTLY CONVERTED ALL THE DIGITAL BEAT THE FILM IMAGES TO. ADDITIONAL AND WHEN I WALKED THE INSTITUTION I SAW DENNIS ACTUALLY DRILLING ANI- AN INMATE PATIENTS TO. AND HE KEPT WIGGLING THE MOUSE WITH HIS- HIS FOOT AND- OBVIOUSLY NEED AN OUTSIDER COULD QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WE'RE GOING AMOUNTS WITH THIS BUT- LET HIM FINISH HIS JOB AFTER WAS DONE WE WENT IN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HIM. AND HE SAID THAT WE HAD TO FIND A POLICY THAT IF YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY MOVE THE MOUSE OF THIS COMING MINUTES. HE COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE SCREEN A WORD THAT HE NEEDED TO DROUGHT. AND SO- WE HAD UNBEKNOWNST TO US TO FIND A POLICY THAT ACTUALLY AFFECTED HIS ABILITY TO DO ITS JOB. AND HE MAY NEVER HAVE BROUGHT THAT UP AND SO I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE DELIVER INCREMENTAL WINS THAT WE NEVER FORGET- THAT WE NEED TO GO OUT AND SEE HOW THAT TECHNOLOGY. IS BEING APPLIED IN REAL LIFE. AND YOU KNOW YOU MEANT THAT. WHEN I MET WITH AND I MEANT TO GET NAME OF THAT DENTAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T TO. END UP THERE- THANK YOU. THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL AND I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO WORLD VOTED FOR YOU THANKS MANAGER. THANK YOU ALTHOUGH I MIGHT ADD THAT DENNIS OBVIOUSLY KNEW HOW TO GET HIS JOB DONE DESPITE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK- I DIDN'T CATCH THE STORED FIRST I THOUGHT HE WAS WE'RE GOING TO. OKAY BUT THAT IS A VERY GOOD IT'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE I THINK IT'S CRITICAL END USERS WHO HAVE TO IT AT ANY RATE SENATOR COME LONGER LET ME GO TO YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT IS A PLEASURE AT CAN MEET YOU AT MISS BAILEY CUMMINS I'M- APOLOGIZE FOR US NOT. BEING ABLE TO FIND TIME ADD TO ME BUT I READ THROUGH YOUR BIO IN YOUR RESPONSES AND THINK YOU ARE- INCREDIBLY QUALIFIED. FOR THIS JOB- I FEEL LIKE I SAY THIS A LOT DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'D WANT IT IT SEEMS OVERWHELMING- I JUST I ALSO HAVE ONLY ONE QUESTION- YOU KNOW I HAVE HEARD THAT SOME DEPARTMENTS ARE STILL USING COBALT- WHICH I THINK. I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL- IN. THE PRIOR MILLENNIA AND SO. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE WITH US HOW. YOU KNOW HOW ANTIQUATED OR OUR OUR SYSTEMS ARE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SYSTEMS. AT ANTIQUATED WHAT IS THE SORT OF THE MODERNIZATION ROLL OUT- FOR BOTH THE PLATFORMS. THAT WE ARE A USING AND THAT ALSO- THAT ARE CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS- ARE REALLY DEPENDENT UPON AND CAN YOU JUST SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THAT'S- HOW THAT IS GOING TO WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY DEPARTMENTS YOU HAVE SO MANY DEPARTMENTS. THAT YOU HAVE TO MONITOR- AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO WHEN COBALT WAS- IMPLEMENTED THE NICE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT WAS HARDWARE AGNOSTIC RIGHT SO IT WAS IT DID TRANSACTIONS EXTREMELY WELL BETTER THAN ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGY AND WAS AT- AT AT THAT HAS THE BEST TIME THE BEST THE BEST- CUTTING TO LANGUAGE YOU COULD USE. AND SO WE DO WE HAVE FOURTEEN DEPARTMENTS THAT STILL USE COBALT- THE SYSTEMS ARE PERFORMING EXACTLY THE WAY THEY WORK AND THE TRANSACTIONS ARE PERFORMING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE OF THIS THANKS 95% OF OUR ATM TRANSACTIONS ARE STILL. USED ON USING COBALT- AND 45% OF THE BANKS FOR THEIR NEED A PRIMARY SYSTEMS NEWS COBALT- WHAT I LOOK FOR IS IT MEETING THE NEEDS OF HER CONSTITUENTS- I THINK T'S NOT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT I WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT IT'S THAT WE HAVE THIS HUGE. YOUR PEOPLE ARE RETIRING- OR THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEMS AND SO OUR JOB. YOU HAVE SEVERAL CHOICES AS A DEPARTMENT AND MANY OF THESE ARE THIRTY FORTY YEARS OLD AND IT REQUIRES RE CODING- IN YOUR BUILDING SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND UP I. AT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WHAT I LIKE SO MUCH IS THAT WE HAVE THE LATEST IBM TECHNOLOGIES AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP DEPARTMENTS MODERNIZE THEIR APPLICATIONS THAT OCCURRED WITHIN THEIR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT- WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL YOU KNOW A BIG BANG WHERE IT HAS TO GO COMPLETELY INTO THE CLOUD SO I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY INCREMENTAL WINS. ON THAT WE CAN BE PUTTING AND PLACE AND NOT NOT WAIT FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE APPLICATIONS TO BE REGRETFUL- I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY LONG TIME AND IF WE APPROACH IT THAT WAY- I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR US AS A STATE TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. TO PULL DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE REPORTING PART OF IT IF IT'S A CERTAIN PART OF THE APPLICATION THAT RUNS- PARTS OF THE DATA THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO BREAK THAT UP AND TO PROVIDE A LOW CODE- SOLUTIONS TO THOSE DEPARTMENTS. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT I HAVE TO SAY AND I. CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO OFFEND YOU BUT- AS I WAS LISTENING TO YOU I WAS THINKING IT IS SO GREAT. THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPOINT A ONE MAN. TO RUN ALL OF THIS- BECAUSE SO OFTEN WHEN WE'RE HAVING FOLKS TALK TO US ABOUT I. T. WE'RE TALKING TO MEN. SO AND I WE WERE JUST ACTUALLY ON WOMEN'S CAUCUS CALL EARLIER TODAY TALKING ABOUTWOMEN IN TECH SO. YOU JUST AFFIRMED- THE PROGRESS THAT I THINK WE'RE MAKING SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE. OKAY THANK YOU A SENATOR I ACTUALLY HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE. YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR OPENING COMMENTS WERE YOU TALK ABOUT YOU'RE GOING TO GO FOR THE INCREMENTAL WIN VERSUS THE BIG. YOU KNOW BANG OR WHATEVER THE PHRASEOLOGY YOU USED BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STUFF IS COMPLEX AND IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE TIME TO DO IT AND MAKE SURE IT'S SOLID YOU KNOW- YOU PAY THE PRICE DOWN THE ROAD IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A BIG SPLASH WHEN REALLY WE SHOULD BE. FOCUSED ON THE FOUNDATIONAL. WITH THAT IN MIND I JUST WANT TO GET SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO OF COURSE OUR- OUR SENATE AND OUR WILL THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE VOTING ON SOME ITEMS TOMORROW. AND AS IT RELATES TO BROADBAND. YOU KNOW WE ARE ON A TIMELINE BASED ON. RESOURCES WERE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT'S OUTLINED THERE. I JUST LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS A LITTLE BIT ON HOW YOU'RE GONNA BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT OBVIOUSLY. HOW YOU WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT AS WE- GET READY TO EXPAND. INTO UNDERSERVED AREAS AND DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT KIND OF MEETING THAT- THAT POINT THAT YOU MADE ABOUT LET'S DO IT RIGHT LET'S MAKE SURE THOUGHT JUST THOUGHTS GENERAL THERE'S NO. SPECIFIC QUESTION THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME- OBVIOUSLY THE PANDEMIC HAD. HIGHLIGHTED THAT WE KNEW THAT THE DIGITAL VITAL. WAS VERY PRESENT IN OUR LIVES. BUT WHEN EVERYONE WAS THEN- REQUIRED TO STAY HOME AND REALLY RELIED ON TECHNOLOGY INTERNET. IT WAS EVEN MORE- GLARING AND IT IS JUST A WONDERFUL EXCITING TIME TO BE- PARTS DEPARTMENT A PART OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP. ADDRESS THOSE THOSE UNDERSERVED AND UNSERVED- IN THE COMMUNITIES AND SO. JUST FOR- YOURSELF AND FOR THE AUDIENCE- WHEN I WORKED AT CORRECTIONAL HEALTHCARE- THOSE PRISON SYSTEMS ARE ALMOST LIKE CITIES FROM. AMONG THEMSELVES AND WE NEED TO MOVE- A LARGE IMAGES FROM ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER- THE BROADBAND THAT WE HAD A FIBER WE HAD BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONS FROM CRESCENT CITY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO BLANK NEAR. THE MEXICO BORDER- WAS NOT SUFFICIENT AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I COME TO THE TABLE WITH AS I HAD LAID. DARK FIBER AND WORK I STOOD UP THE ROLE HEALTH PROGRAM- THAT ENABLE THAT ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE- IN ADDITION- YES SOME OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED MICROLITER ACRES- I WORKED ON THE DARK FIBER. TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT AT ANY POINT IN TIME THE DOCTORS HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL RECORDS TO PRESCRIPTION. THINGS ARE NECESSARY SO I COME WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE AND I GET TO PARTNER WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR POINT TEAM- THAT'S OVER AT THE FRONT OFFICE OF BROADBAND AND DIGITAL LITERACY. WE ARE OBVIOUSLY WORKING AND WE CAN'T DO IT OUR ORDER BUYER SOMETHING WE GET TO ALSO WORK WITH THAT. CPU ST- A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR AND ALSO- DEPARTMENT OF. TRANSPORTATION THAT WE ALL HAVE. GREAT SKILLS AS ONE THING THAT. TRANSPORTATION HOUSES THEY KNOW HOW TO BUILD RIGHT AWAY AS THEY KNOW HOW TO LAY FIBER- SO LEVERAGING OUR SKILL SETS WE ARE. TECHNOLOGISTS WE KNOW HOW TO BUILD BROADBAND NETWORKS. THIRD PARTY MINISTERS. OTHERS MANY OF THEM OUT THERE WE HAVE YES EVERYONE LINE BUT ONE THAT HELP BEEN VERY. IN THE EDUCATE REALM AND IF YOU SEE HAS DONE IT AND- JOB AND KNOWS. WHAT WE TO APPLY. THAT IN SOME SERVICE. SO IT'S GOING TO BE A COLLECTIVE EFFORT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATE- LOWS COMMITTEE AND ADMINISTRATION. YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO- ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT GAP. IN AND OUR- IT IS A SOLID DIGITAL BIASES SIDE SOCIETAL DECLINE I THINK WHICH IS TIME THAT WE ADDRESS IT HEAD ON. THANK YOU FOR THAT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT AND- I KNOW THAT MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE ARE GOING TO REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO UPDATES ALONG THE WAY- IN TERMS OF HOW THIS IS GOING THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT. EVER AND- IT MEANS SO MUCH TO SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I ONLY HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION I WANTED TO MAYBE COME IN A LITTLE BIT I HAVE THOUGHT. A COUPLE OF COLLEGE COLLEAGUES TO ASK FOR UPDATES AS PART OF THE SOME OF OUR CAUCUS- OF MEETINGS AND SO THAT WILL BE COMING YOUR WAY AS- WELL AS- YES BUT- CYBER SECURITY AND YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND. I IN FACT I THINK WE RECENTLY ASK ABOUT THAT WE HAD A POINT TO USED TO THE- CAL I SO BORED AND OTHERS AND WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CYBER SECURITY YOUR THOUGHTS JUST FROM. THE ROLE THAT YOU HAVE ON CYBER SECURITY AND- MAYBE IT. TOSS IN THERE A LITTLE BIT AS WE HAVE BEEN IN THIS PANDEMIC AND DONE WROTE REMOTE OUT WORK. AND MAY END UP WITH A HYBRID- WITH SOME OF OUR STATE EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS OUR OWN. OUR THOUGHTS ON CYBER SECURITY JUST GENERALLY IN AND AS IT RELATES TO. HOW WE'RE MOVING TO WORK DIFFERENTLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- PARTS MY CURRENT ROLE I WAS OTHER CALPERS CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER WHICH INCLUDED- BEING A PRIVACY. OFFICER AND SO I IT I WORKED WITH THE FLORIDA AS A FIDUCIARY DUTY REGARDING CYBER AND- DID A LOT TO IMPROVE THEIR SECURITY POSTURE THERE SO THAT'S- THAT'S THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I BRING TO THIS ROLE. I GET TO PARTNER WITH- THE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER. AND WHAT I BELIEVE IS I MEAN AGAIN IT'S ALL EXCEPT CYBERSECURITY IS ALL OUR RESPONSIBILITY- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. ALL THE SECURITY SAFEGUARDS AND WE HAVE. AN ON PREMISE IN BUILDING- ENVIRONMENT IS WHAT WAS APPLIED ACROSS THE STATE AND SO- THE INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS- INFORMATION SHARED OUT TO ALL THE DEPARTMENTS. AND AGAIN WHEN I WAS A CALPERS WHICH ELECTED SHEETS MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE CONNECTING. THEY WERE CONNECTING VIA EVEN IF THEY'RE USING THEIR OWN PERSONAL DEVICE. THEY WERE ABLE TO CONNECT TO A SECURE ENVIRONMENT WITH AN ARC- OUR BUILDING AND THEN ACCESS THE APPLICATION. SO THAT IT ACCESS THE APPLICATION pAND LAYERS OF DEFENSE- YOU HAVE YOUR CROWN JEWELS YOUR- YOUR- YOUR MEMBERS ARE YOUR TAXPAYERS- I SEE THEM AS A CENTER OF THE EARTH. AND THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PROPER STROLLED AWAY ACROSS THAT SO YOU HAVE THE APPLICATION TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT ACCESS TO THE APPLICATION- THE PEOPLE THAT A MINISTER THAT APPLICATION WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE'S IMPERSONATING THOSE INDIVIDUALS. IN ORDER TO DO IT- VERY STINGS WITHIN THAT APPLICATION AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU HAVE. THE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE SERVERS AND NETWORKS- THE PERIMETER. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE LAYERS SO FIVE TEN TECHNOLOGIES THAT EACH PLAYER SO IF ONE. OF TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT PICK IT UP THE OTHER DOES. SO MAKING SURE. YOU HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND PLACE. BUT THEN- YOU PROBABLY HEARD THE SAYING THAT IT'S NOT A MATTER IF BUT WHEN- SOME SURE THE- IF. SOME ABOUT I GUESS AND TO ASSIST THAT THEY- IT'S SEGMENTS THAT THERE THERE'S MINIMAL DAMAGE- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ARCHITECT OUR SYSTEM SO THAT IT IS- SEGMENTED TO A POINT WHERE NO ONE CAN DO MAXIMUM DAMAGE. WE WILL HAVE TO PREVENT BATCH AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- OUR TEAM MEMBERS ARE TRAINED 290% OF ALL DATA BREACHES ARE STILL- TIED TO. AN INDIVIDUAL UNBEKNOWNST EMPLOYEE THAT THEY OPEN UP AN EMAIL LINK. THE HOUSE NUMBER ON IT AND WHEN THEY OPEN IT UP. THAT THAT THREAT ACTOR DOESN'T ALWAYS NECESSARILY- DO SOMETHING BAD RIGHT AWAY THEY CAN SIT IN YOUR NETWORK IF YOU'RE NOT DOING INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS AND HOW CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES. AND SO WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED NOT TO CLICK ON ANYTHING- SO YOU ARE DOING INTERNAL FISHING AND EDUCATION. AND THEN IF THEY DO CLICK ON IT YOU WANT TO CATCH UP WITH THE TECHNOLOGY SO THERE'S NO DATA LEAKAGE OUTSIDE OF HERE- STRUCTURE SO. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOUR HOUSE BUILT AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACCESSING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY'RE DOING IT IN THE SAME MANNER YOU KNOW IT'S VIRTUALLY BUT THERE HAVE THE SAME STATE OUR SYSTEM. THEY WERE PHYSICALLY IN THE BUILDING. WELL THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR- HELPING US UNDERSTAND BASIC. ODD KNOWLEDGE AND I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS IN THE FUTURE AS WE ARE EXPOSED TO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. I DON'T HAVE OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I'M PREPARED TO GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- MY COLLEAGUES SEEM FINE WITH THAT SO- LET ME START RIGHT HERE- IN ROOM THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE WE'RE GONNA START WITH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND TO OUR WITNESSES LET ME JUST- DIRECT TO. YOU TO ENSURE THE SOCIAL DISTANCING DON'T FORM A LINE. OF THAT SORT OF THING AND- ONCE- I ACTUALLY AM NOT SURE I SEE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE- IN SUPPORT. SO WE HAVE A SECOND ROOM LET ME LOOK AT ROOM ONE TWELVE. AND THERE'S NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE OZ SO- WE WILL TURN TO THE TELECONFERENCE.

THE FIRST ONE IS WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT- THE POSSIBLE ROLE THAT- CRYPTO CURRENCY- MAY PLAY. AND HOW WE LIVE AND HOW WE- PROTECT HOW WE NEGOTIATE CREDIT- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT MORE AND MORE. CITIES ARE GETTING INTO THE CRYPTOCURRENCY SPACE AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THOSE KINDS OF- CONVERSATIONS ARE ELEVATED TO THE STATE LEVEL SO LET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION- CRYPTOCURRENCY IS IN THE NEWS A LOT A LOT OF PEOPLE SCRATCH THEIR HEADS WHEN THEY SEE THE WORD AND DON'T QUITE-KNOW WHAT IT IS IT IS A BLANKET TERM. FOR A TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION THAT IS SHOWING UP IN MORE THAN ONE KIND OF WAY IN FINANCIAL SERVICES ON THE TECHNOLOGY THAT UNDERGIRDS CRYPTO CURRENCIES COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON DEPOSIT TAKING AND LENDING ONE PAYMENT PROCESSING- AND SO THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THAT. I HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT- WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN THIS SPACE INDEED THIS IS OUTSIDE OF MY PARTICULAR DIVISION I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A DIRECT ROLE IN SUPERVISING CRYPTO CURRENCY AS A TECHNOLOGY HOWEVER IDO KNOW IN SOME OF OUR OTHER DIVISIONS WE HAVE SOME. LICENSEES THAT ARE LOOKING TO CRYPTOCURRENCY AS A SOLUTION TO THEIR BUSINESS MODEL I AND WE HAVE TO TAKE A MEASURED APPROACH HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACETS TO CRYPTOCURRENCY GET BECAUSE IT SHOWS UP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES IN MORE THAN ONE WAY WE NEED TO. TAKE A MEASURED APPROACH. LOOK CASE BY CASE. I HAVE A PARTICULAR. USE CASE- TO THE PATH. AND SO THERE ARE SOME BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO REGULATE I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH AND REGULARLY TALK WITH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS BECAUSE THIS ALTHOUGH MANY OF THESE COMPANIES OUR HOUSE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE NOT JUST STATEWIDE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GROWTH OF THIS MARKET BUT THERE ARE ATIONAL AND ACTUALLY EVEN INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH FINANCIAL REGULATORS GET THEIR ARMS AROUND. THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND DETERMINE. HOW BEST TO REGULATE DONE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. AS WITH ANY OTHER INNOVATION WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WHERE THERE ARE BENEFITS ARE THAT WE ARE KNOWLEDGE DOES BUT WE ALWAYS NEED TO ENSURE. THAT THESE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS ARE NOT CREATING SYSTEMIC RISK OR POSING HARM TO CONSUMERS BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT A PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO COME FROM OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. TO BE GUINEA PIGS FOR SO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION SO THERE REALLY IS A DELICATE BALANCING ACT THERE- BUT AGAIN WE ARE TAKING. A VERY MEASURED APPROACH AND GATHERING THAT DATA AND I ANTICIPATE THAT AS WE LEARN MORE AND AS WE ENGAGE MORE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ARE THINKING WILL OF ALL AND OUR POLICY WILL FALL ALONG THE WAY. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT. IT'S BEEN ON MY MIND MOSTLY BECAUSE- CITIES- IN FLORIDA FOR EXAMPLE AND IN SOME OTHER STATES. ARE NOW ALLOWING. CRYPTO CURRENCY TO BE USED TO PAY FOR- CITY SERVICES. AND SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT OTHER CITIES AND OTHER STATES WILL BEGIN TO LOOK INTO SO I ALWAYS THINK IT'S GOOD. TO BE IN FRONT OF THE EIGHT BALL RATHER THAN. BUT IT I CERTAINLY A- EXPERTISE INTHE CONSUMER PROTECTION SPACE I THINK- WE NEED MORE OF IT AND- THERE'S BEEN SOME GOOD BILLS. THAT HAVE- PAST- IN THIS LEGISLATURE RECENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING OUR- CONSUMERS. ARE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME GOOD FAITH ACTORS SOME GOOD FAITH LENDERS. IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE PLAYING BY OUR RULES. BUT WITH SOME ADVANCES IN THE- FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY. AS AT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN JUST GO- ONLINE OR GO OUT OF STATE AND SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU CAN PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND ELEVATE AND SUPPORT ARE OF GOOD FAITH CALIFORNIA LENDERS. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION THAT IS OUR MISSION NOW IS DO YOU HAVE P. I. VERY VERY CLEARLY STATED. IN THE C. C. F. P. L. WE HAVE A DUAL MISSION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND FOSTER RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION WHEN TECHNOLOGY OUTPACES THE LAW AS IT. IS WANT TO DO- THERE CAN BE A CONUNDRUM FROM UNFAIR COMPETITION STANDPOINT WHERE THERE IS REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY THERE COULD BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF RESPONSIBLE INNOVATORS NOT KNOWING WHICH RULES ARE SUPPOSED TO PLAY BY WHICH CAN INFORM ATTENTION INHERIT THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS ALSO FOR RULE AT THE DEPARTMENT IS TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING DATA AND STAKEHOLDER PROACTIVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WITH FOLKS ON ALL SIDES NOT JUST COMMUNITY GROUPS BUT ALSO WITH INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THE WORK UNDERSTANDING WHERE THERE ARE COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND CONCERNS ARE BECAUSE AS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND UPDATE OUR REGULATIONS INFORMED BY DATA AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND ENSURE THAT RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW AND HOPEFULLY PROVIDE BETTER. SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR OUR RESPONSES AND LOOK FOR TO HEAR A- CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR LAYERED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I ENJOYED TALKING WITH YOU THIS MORNING AND IT JUST ASK YOU ONE QUESTION IF WE- TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING. YOU INDICATED THAT YOUR DID YOUR DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH THE DRAFTING OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW. AND I WAS GOING TO ASK IF THE LAW HAS CONFORM TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS THUS FAR- HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING THAT WAS ON ANTICIPATED OR- CREATES A GAP THAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION THE LAW IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND WE ARE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT IS I THINK VERY WHAT'S VERY POWERFUL ABOUT IT AND WHAT IS SO EXCITING ABOUT IT IS A TO PROVIDE US WITH BROAD AND FLEXIBLE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION AS A GENERAL MATTER OVER PROVIDERS OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SO IT GIVES US THE ROOM WE NEED. TO IDENTIFY RISKS IDENTIFYING GAPS AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY ALREADY THAT WE CAN THEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF JUST AS I WAS PREVIOUSLY STATING THERE'S A LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD PROVIDE BETTER CLARITY HI TECH INDUSTRY AT THE END OF THE DAY PROTECT CONSUMERS ARE SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IMPLEMENTATION WILL TAKE A LOT OF WORK WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHERE WE ARE IN A FEW YEARS TIME- BUT I AM PLEASED THAT THE LEGISLATURE WORKING AND I IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND SO COLLABORATIVELY CONSTRUCTIVELY LAST YEAR. UNDER ALL OF THE STRANGE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WERE LIVING AND I WAS ABLE TO COME TOGETHER TO PASS THIS AND IT IS A IT'S A TRULY EXCITING TIME TO JUDGE TO BE AT THE DEPARTMENT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING DIALOGUE.

AND THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT URBINA I DIRECTLY OPERATED MANY OF THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE TRANSFERRING TO CDSS BEFORE.

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR LET ME MADAM VICE CHAIR LET ME START WITH YOU THIS TIME WELL THANK YOU. ME GET MY- THANK YOU DOCTOR I NEED MILK I THINK THAT TRUTHFULLY I HOLD- I WANT TO THANK YOU ARE LOOKING AT YOUR RESUME AND THANK YOU FOR MANY MANY YEARS THAT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS SO VERY IMPORTANT. ARENA OF- A CHILDREN AND FAMILY IF I WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A SOCIAL WORKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES THIRTY NOT A WITHIN THE LONG BEACH OFFICE FOR MANY YEARS AND ALSO IN THE SOUTHEAST L. A. OFFICE FOR A COUPLE A YEAR SO- VERY VERY- DIFFICULT- YEARS I THINK. WITH THAT PARTICULAR- HI MEGAN ARE FIVE. ONE OF THE OLDER FOLKS HERE. BUT IF THE BALLOT SELECTION DIFFICULT SUSAN ADVANCEMENT MOVING OUR- CHILD CARE SERVICES UNDER CDF AND AWAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO. LET ME ASK YOU A DO YOU THINK WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED THAT OF. ANY OF THE- EDUCATIONAL. UNEVEN OPPORTUNITIES OF OUR CHILDREN UP WOULD BE AFFECTED BY PUTTING IT SPECIFICALLY AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES VERSUS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- A MINOR CONCERN BUT CERTAINLY ONE I THINK THAT. ARE NEED TO BE ASKING YOU I LOOK TO YOU- CERTAINLY OF AN EXPERT- ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET ENSURE THAT THE CHILD CARE IN THE EDUCATION. OF OUR OUR YOUNGSTERS ARE A FEEL. SEAMLESS FUND TOGETHER AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES. CERTAINLY AREN'T FOR GROWTH. IT'S THANK YOU SAN PER YEAR FAST- IN REGARDS TO- THE ROLE OF EDUCATION FRIGHTENS HOW CARE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND I BOTH FOR YEAR AT THAT TIME WHEN WE THINK OF OUR CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND IT AND- THAT'S HOW DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WE HAVE TO EMPHASIZE THAT EDUCATION IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THIS PROGRAM. CARE AND EDUCATION GO HAND IN HAND THIS WILL. THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE TOUCH SO MUCH IN THESE EARLY YEARS BASED ON THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ACT LIFESPANS. AS WE LOOK AT ARE MOVING FORWARD AND YOU. TALKED ABOUT THE SCENE THE STREAMLINING ACT TOGETHER I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY CRITICAL FOR CVE NCSS TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO HAPPEN INTEGRATION HAPPENING WE MODEL THAT NICELY DURING THIS TRANSITION YEAR. PRIOR TO THIS TRANSITION YEAR WE CONTINUE TO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK TOGETHER AND POST THE TRANSITION WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS ARE IN SEEK TO HAVE THAT SEAMLESS TRANSFER FOR OUR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. WELL I THINK- YOU SAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT ON TRACK AS SOON AS SADDAM STARTED JULY FIRST THAT'S FOURTEEN DAYS THEN. ANY BUMPS ALONG THAT ROAD YEAH. YES SO THAT WAS DEFINITELY A SHORT TERM GOAL RIGHT THAT. MILESTONE OF JULY FIRST AND- YOU SEE THERE THERE'S ALWAYS FUN. WHEN YOU ARE TRANSITIONING- SUCH A LARGE- DIVISION FROM ONE GOVERNMENT AGENCY INTO ANOTHER- I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT JULY FIRST IS HERE THAT THAT- HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN POINT FIVE POSITION UP ALREADY- POSITIONS AND SOME OF THOSE ARE. OUR BILL WOULD HAVE TO COME OVER TO CDSS WE ARE TAPPING INTO THEIR- THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE TO HELP SHAPE THE SUBMISSION AND WE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY WERE ABLE TO USE SENSE- CONTRACTS THE CONTRACTS OUT TO THE CONTRACTORS TUNES. SURE THAT NATO DESTRUCTION OCCURRED WITHIN. THE SERVICES AT. THE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS HAVE ANOTHER CONCERN BUT I'M GOING TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE I BELIEVE I HAVE SOMETHING THAT ON ALL OUR MINDS AND DADDY- SO WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THE CHILD CARE SERVICES. THAT WERE SO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED OUR DURING THE PANDEMIC POTS PEOPLE. TELL THEIR SERVICE OF- NOT AVAILABLE TO OUR BOB PARENT TO PARENT TO WORKING FAMILIES AND ALSO- TOO MANY MANY PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THAT- AS CERTAINLY A CAREER PATH. IN A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ONE SO I'LL DEFER THAT I'M SURE IT'LL COME UP AGAIN FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BRAIDED QUESTIONS AND JUST THANK YOU AGAIN FOR. A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ENOUGH AND CERTAINLY HAVE HANDS ON KNOWLEDGE AS YOU FOR WORK THROUGH ODDS AND MANY DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT ANDI WILL BE ARE SUPPORTING. YOUR CONFIRMATION APPOINTMENT- SENATOR COM LONGER I'M TO GO TO IN THE OF THAT YOU HAVE TO LEAVE FOR A HEALTH COMMITTEE- SO IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD SURE THANK YOU ARE. MADAM CHAIR I WANNA THANK YOU- DR MYLAN FOR THE TIME THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SPEND- YESTERDAY I THINK IT WAS OUR MONDAY I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER ANYMORE BUT REALLY DELIGHTED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU- AND REALLY EXCITED ABOUT- YOUR CONFIRMATION- AS I SHARED WITH YOU I THINK IT'S SO INCREDIBLE. AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS POSITION SO MANY OF OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE WOMEN THEY ARE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS AND THEY ARE WOMEN OF COLOR- AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO HAVE REPRESENTATION IN THIS SPACE IN GOVERNMENT. SO THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES AND THEIR FRUSTRATIONS ARE ANCHORED IN A REALITY THAT SOMEONE ACKNOWLEDGES SO I'M REALLY EXCITED- AND I WANTED TO SAY THAT'S AND YOU SAID YOU HAD A WATCH PARTY IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GET A LITTLE YOU KNOW LOVE WHEN YOU HAVE THAT. WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY AND I WOULD JUST LOVE TO. HAVE YOU RESPOND TO IT AGAIN YOU KNOW I SHARED WITH YOU MY THOUGHTS ON TEEKAY. OUT WE KNOW THAT IT IS COMING I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT UNDER YOUR DIRECT PURVIEW. BUT YOU KNOW AS I SHARED WITH YOU I BELIEVE THAT THE T. K. EXPANSION WILL DIRECTLY. IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR- COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS. TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND TO SERVE. OUR CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND FAMILIES- WE KNOW THAT FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE THE MONEY MAERS THEY PAY THE BILLS FOR. OUR CHILD CARE CENTERS. BECAUSE INFANT CARE INFANT AND TODDLER CARE IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. AND THE CONCERN THAT MANY PROVIDERS- AND ADVOCATES IN THE SPACE HAVE SHARED. IS THAT IF THERE IS AN ACCIDENT A FOUR YEAR OLDS- INTO A T. K. PROGRAM. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THESE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING AND GRINDING IT OUT FOR YEARS AND YEARS TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN AND PROVIDING THEM. THE ECT- THAT IS SO CRITICAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR YOUNG MINDS AND THEIR BODIES- YOU KNOW CHOICES NOT CHOICE. IF THE FUNDING IS ONLY FOR ONE KIND OF SETTING. AND SO IT MAKES DELIVERY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND HAVING A SYSTEM THAT RECOGNIZES THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF WORKING PARENTS. IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS PARENTS TO WORK OFF HOURS PARENTS WHO NEED TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE PART OF THE EQUATION WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. APPROPRIATELY FUNDING CHILD CARE AND REALLY SORT OF AN INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN A FRAMEWORK THAT EGGMAN KNOWLEDGES THE REALITIES OF ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT COMPRISE CALIFORNIA AND NEED CARE. SO JUST WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO. ESERVER THIS MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM. WHEN GIVEN THE POTENTIAL- THAT THERE'S AN EXODUS OF FOUR YEAR OLDS WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE OUR OUR LICENSE EXAM PROVIDERS IN OUR FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES- WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE TRENCHES FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND PROBABLY FEEL LIKE WERE DESERTING THEM. GRANTED WE GOT RIGHT REFORM GRANTED WE HAVE THE S. R. R. IN THE ARM ARE COMING- AND WE ARE YOU KNOW DOUBLING DOWN IN THAT SPACE BUT- THERE IS CONCERN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL AS YOUR QUESTION- LET'S FIRST START BY. KNOWLEDGE IN THE IMPORTANT. ROLE PASSED THE NEXT DELIVERY SYSTEM HAS IN REGARDS TO OUR FAMILIES ACCESSING CARE AND BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR JOBS ESPECIALLY AROUND POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT OUR TRADITIONAL HOURS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF EIGHTY FIVE WHICH MANY PARK FAMILIES HEAT. ON DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THAT MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT BECAUSE IT'S A TERM THAT WE USE. BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS OUR FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AS WELL AS OUR- OUR OUR CENTER BASED CARE AND OUR- LICENSE FAMILY TALK HER HOME PROVIDERS. AND SO HAVING THAT MIX DELIVER SYSTEM INTACT I MENTIONED IS CRUCIAL AND IT BUT IT REALLY SUPPORTS OUR PARENTS HAVE PRINCE WITH CHOICE TO BE ABLE TO. WRAP AROUND CARE AS THEIR NEEDS AS THEY IDENTIFY THEIR NEEDS AS WELL AS LOOKING AT IT FROM CULTURE AS WELL AS LOOKING AT IT FOR WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM. SO THAT VERY CRITICAL I WOULD UNDERSCORE WHAT YOU SHARED WITH TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THERE'S A COUPLE PIECES THAT WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT- THE NEXT DELIVERY SYSTEM AND MAINTAIN THAT. WHEN THIS COORDINATION IS KEY. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CUP COLLABORATION AND MEETINGS WITH OUR CITY PARTNERS- HAVING QUICK CONVERSATIONS IN REGARDS TO THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS THAT ARE TRANSFERRED OVER TO CBS FAST. NOT ONLY WRAP AROUND THE T. K. OPTION. ASSUMING THAT PARENTS WOULD WANT TO CHOOSE THAT TO- BUT ALSO THAT IT'S A SEAMLESS WRAP AROUND. HOW TO ENSURE THAT PARENTS ARE NOT ONLY AND ROLLING WITH OUR PROGRAM BUT-ARE ARE AWARE OF OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL AS- IF THEY'RE ENROLLED IN TKA PROGRAMS THEY'RE ALSO SHARED ABOUT OTHER SERVICES AROUND THE CHILD AND DEVELOPMENT. EFFICIENT THAT IS GOING TO B. MUTUAL CONVERSE THAT HAD BEFORE A CONTINUE TO HAVE. AN BE ABLE TO SERVE THAT BUT SOME GUY AROUND THAT. THE SECOND THING I WILL CALL OUT TO BEING PARENTAL CHU. PRINTER CHOICES CRITICAL HERE MANY OF OUR CONTRACTORS AS WELL AS OUR MIX DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE STRONG ADVOCATES TO ENSURE THAT PARENTS KNOW THAT THAT PRINTER CHAU SUCCESS AND MAKE THEM AWARE OF WHAT. IT MEANS TO HAVE PRINCE WITH CHOICE AND SO CONTINUE TO HAPPENS PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE TO THE FIELD IN THAT AREA WILL BE IMPORTANT ALSO. AND THEN FINALLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING OUT THIS MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH HAPPY A GREATER PRESENCE OF TKA WE ALSO WANT TO BE MINDFUL THAT ARE STAKEHOLDERS THAT INCLUDES OUR LICENSE PROVIDERS. AS WELL AS OTHERS REALLY DO YOU HAVE SOLUTIONS PRESS OF HOW THIS CAN WORK AND SO WE ARE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE TIME TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND BRING THAT VOICE BACK INTO THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING COLLECTIVELY. THAT I THINK WILL BRING THEM. A STRONGER MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM. GREAT YEAH THANK YOU THAT I AM AS I SHARE WITH YOU I SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT CRYSTAL STAIRS WE HAD A CHILD CARE CENTER- WE WORK WITH LICENSED AND LICENSE EXEMPT PROVIDERS AND WE TOOK CARE FAMILIES THAT WERE STAGE ONE STAGE TO STAGE THREE- AND AT. EIGHT P. AND HAD IN OUR IN OUR- THIS IS A SPACE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE- THE SAYING IS TRUE CHILD CARE KEEPS CALIFORNIA WORKING AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IT AND SUPPORT FROM ITS DELIVERY SYSTEM. THAT ACKNOWLEDGES OF THE UNIQUE NEEDS AND CULTURAL AND- UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES OF OUR FAMILY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- AGREEING TO SERVE IN THIS ROLE. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTERED EARLIER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN THANK YOU FOR YOUR- HER WILLINGNESS TO SERVE AND DO THIS AND I THINK I WANNA JUST MAYBE WITH THE QUESTIONER TO BUILD ON COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS OF MY TWO COLLEAGUES AND I CHAIR THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE AND WITH THE TRANSITION ON JULY FIRST. WE HAD HEARINGS BUT WE HAVE JOINTLY WITH OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE BECAUSE AFTER JULY FIRST THAT'S WHO WOULD HAVE JURISDICTION AND BEFORE JULY FIRST IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE WOULD NEVER SEE INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY. AND IT WAS TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS THAT AND AT THE TIME WE HAD THOSE HEARINGS. IT WAS BECOMING A LITTLE CLEARER WHAT THE NUMBERS WERE FROM THE PANDEMIC ON DROP OFF. BECAUSE OF OUR CENTERS NOT OPERATING. AND WE WERE CONCERNED PROSPECTIVELY ABOUT THE TRANSITION ON JULY FIRST AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT AND SAID THAT VOTES FOR THE TRANSITION IS GOING PRETTY WELL. BUT AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE. THAT WE WOULD AUTHORIZE MORE SLOTS AND HIGHER WAGES SO MY QUESTION IS IN THE TERMS OF THE TRANSITION AND THE OTHER THING IS THIS. IS THERE WAS A LOT OF DEBATE AFTER THE MAY REVISE ABOUT THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF. PRE K. T. K. AND N. CENTERS AND I TAKE A NOTE THE SENATE REALLY PUSHED. FOR THE PARENTS TO HAVE OPTIONS AND FOR THE OPTIONS TO CONTINUE SO THAT WHATEVER WORKS BEST WOOD. SO NOW THAT IS IN ESSENCE WHAT WAS ADOPTED AND THE ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR SLOTS AND THE ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR SALARIES. SO ARE YOU SAID THE TRANSITIONS GOING WELL HOW DO YOU THINK TRANSITIONING TO THIS BIGGER SYSTEM IS GOING TO GO DO YOU FEEL A QUICK TO DO IT DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE ADEQUATE TIME LINES. ARE YOU IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING AND YOU'RE NOT SURE YET HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE JUST THE CHANGES THAT ARE ABOUT TO FALL ON YOU RIGHT NOW. FOUR THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL ONE. HAS IT TOUCHES ON REALLY THE VISION THAT WE HAVE THAT INVOLVES WHO CHILD OR FAMILY. AND AS YOU SEEN WITH THOSE JOINT HEARING. OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUR FAMILIES LIVE BERKELEY IN BOTH. RIGHTS BOTH HEALTH AS WELL AS EDUCATION AND SO WHEN THINKING ABOUT TIS TRANSITION AND WHAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY AND MONUMENTUM LOOP FOR THE LEGISLATOR AND FOR OUR ADMINISTRATION TO REALLY MAKE. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES WITHIN THAT WHOLE CHILD OR FAMILY BISHOP. IT'S VERY CRITICAL AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT BIG STEP. IN TERMS OF HOW THAT LOOKS LIKE MOVING FORWARD- I CAN ONLY CALL OUT THAT. WE HAVE YOU KNOW OUR VISION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE. THAT THESE SERVICES SLIP WITH THEN ALL THE OTHER SERVICES. AS FAMILIES WALK THROUGH THE DOORS OF CHAO PARENTS ABOUT MY PROGRAMS. WE KNOW THAT TALKING ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ARCHITECT AT THE ICEBERG THEY'RE COMING IN WITH SO MANY OTHER SERVICES PERHAPS THAT THEY ARE. AWARE THAT THEY COULD POSSIBLY ACCESS AND THEREFORE REALLY THINKING THROUGH HOW THEY- DO THOSE NAVIGATION. SKILLS AT INCLUDE LINKING OUR FAMILIES TO OUR OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS IS ONE THAT THE- LONG TIME LONG TERM AND HOPEFULLY COME SOONER. THAN WHAT WE THINK- TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS MOVE OVER TO THAT DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. SO WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN MOVING FORWARD. THIS WORK IS GOING TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON THE FAMILIES NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE ENTRY POINT THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE SERVICES BUT- A WRAPAROUND. THAT INCLUDES THE OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. THAT FAMILIES WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS. WELL I REALLY. THAT RESPONSE AND LYFT-THAT THIS GOING TO BE A MOVING TARGET AS RESPONSIBILITY SHIFTS AND EXPANSION HAPPENS. AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO STAY IN REGULAR TOUCH WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ARE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO. MONITOR IT. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE HELPFUL IF THERE ARE. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES GAPS ARE OF THE WAYS THAT THIS JUST WASN'T STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT REALLY WORKS WE'RE REALLY GOING TO WANT TO KNOW THAT AND SO FAR I KNOW THAT WE'LL BE DOING OVERSIGHT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. BUT I THINK WE WOULD REALLY HOPE FOR A RELATIONSHIP GOING FORWARD ON EXACTLY THOSE ISSUES SO THAT. THAT WE CAN HELP NAVIGATE THEM ONCE AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE I'M A LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING.
