AND IT TURNS OUT ONE OF THE MOST

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:23.781 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY CITED REASONS WAS AND

00:41:22.347 --> 00:41:25.483 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR CASE A MANDATORY

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:27.251 region:rollup2
SPAY NEUTER LAW THERE AND THE

00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:28.686 region:rollup2
FOLKS JUST REALLY DID NOT HAVE

THE MEANS TO.

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:33.291 region:rollup2
TIP TIP I'D DO THE SURGERY NOT

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:34.992 region:rollup2
TO MENTION JUST HAVING ACCESS TO

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:35.360 region:rollup2
THE SURGERY IN THEIR COMMUNITY

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:37.161 region:rollup2
IT'S.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.629 region:rollup2
YA WELL DOCUMENTED THAT IN LOW

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.897 region:rollup2
INCOME COMMUNITIES THERE IT

00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:42.033 region:rollup2
REALLY IS A DEARTH OF VETERINARY

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:43.234 region:rollup2
SERVICES GENERALLY. BUT THEN

00:41:42.033 --> 00:41:44.569 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU ADD THE FINANCIAL

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:46.571 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS OF HAVING A

00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:48.339 region:rollup2
MANDATORY LAW IN THOSE

00:41:46.571 --> 00:41:49.240 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CASE SAYS YOU THE GAP

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:50.641 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY GROWS AND SO

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.810 region:rollup2
THERE'S REALLY LITTLE TO NO

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:54.245 region:rollup2
ACCESS. SO THIS IS THE

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.779 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE LA COUNTY BUT REALLY

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.713 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY WE SEE THE SAME

00:41:54.779 --> 00:41:57.648 region:rollup2

UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:06.491 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:42:04.422 --> 00:42:07.525 region:rollup2
STATISTIC FALL TO NINE PERCENT
