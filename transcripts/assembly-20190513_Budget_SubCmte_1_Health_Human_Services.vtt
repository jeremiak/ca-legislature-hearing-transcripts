WHAT FOR THE AGENCY

RESTRUCTURING HOW WILL THIS

00:23:15.093 --> 00:23:16.762
REORGANIZATION CHANGE POLICY

OUTCOMES THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:21.032

AND SO I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.958
WITH THESE RESOURCES IS THAT

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:48.527

ABSOLUTELY NEW SET OUT ONE ONE

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:19.791
PARTICULAR AREA IS A MASTER PLAN

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:22.861

ADDRESS THE AGING -- SITUATION

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:31.937
IN CALIFORNIA A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:33.405
COLLEGES YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:34.606
THAT'S SUCH A BAD TERM BECAUSE I

00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:36.541
I I THINK IT'S NOT A BAD THING I

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:37.943
THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:39.377
THAT PEOPLE ARE AGING WELL.

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:41.012
BUT THE GOVERNOR AND THE

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:42.714
SECRETARY EXPECT THAT WE PULL

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:44.249
TOGETHER PUT PULL TOGETHER

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:46.384
MASTER PLAN THAT'S ACTIONABLE

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:47.252
AND SO THESE RESOURCES REALLY

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.854
WOULD BE DESIGNED TO HELP US

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.788
ENSURE.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.556
THAT WITHIN A YEAR NOT ONLY DO

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:52.958
WE HAVE A PLAN BUT THE PLAN HAS

00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:54.926
ACTIONABLE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.061

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.295
NEXT DECADE.

00:24:57.362 --> 00:24:58.663
AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE MOVING

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.599
THE NEEDLE BOTH AS A GOVERNMENT

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:02.167

IN THE LAST BUDGET ALLOCATED FOR

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.991
THAT COMMISSION WHY THE REQUEST

NO I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.584
WEEDS OF EVERYTHING BUT I THINK

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:09.219
IT'S I DO WANT TO JUST TAKE A

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:10.754
MINUTE TO EXPLAIN.

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:11.955
HOW WE WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:13.790
WITH KIND OF THAT ASSUMPTION

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:16.360
WITH THE ALLOCATION IN THE

FUNDING FOR EACH OF THESE AREAS?

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:18.996
BECAUSE ON AVERAGE IT IS

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:24.301
OF THOSE PROVIDERS.

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:26.036
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT BEING ABLE

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.638
TO DO IT BEING INFORMED BASED ON

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:28.872
OUR RATE STUDY THAT WE HAD

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:33.110
DISCUSSED -- EARLIER -- AND AND

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:33.710
IN DISCUSSING THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:36.513

PERCENTAGE OF IF WE WE HAD

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:45.656
IMPLEMENTED THE RATE MODELS.

00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:46.590
KIND OF WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:48.292
FALLEN INTO.

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:49.926
AN INCREASE.

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:52.529
RELATIVEACROSS THE STATE OF OF

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.264
WITH THOSE IN SCOPE SERVICES AND

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.866
SO BEING ABLE TO USE THAT TO

00:48:55.932 --> 00:48:57.901
INFORM US AND SAY OKAY USING

00:48:57.968 --> 00:48:59.269
THAT IS KIND OF OUR FLOOR.

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:01.938
SO WITHIN THAT KIND OF FLOOR

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:03.674
THAT WE WOULD BE ESTABLISHING

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.409
THAT ANY PROVIDER THAT WITH THAT

00:49:05.475 --> 00:49:07.177

BUT ANYBODY THAT'S ABOVE IT

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:18.288
WOULD NOT BE REDUCED.

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:19.956
SO WE WOULD NOT BE PROTECTING

00:49:20.023 --> 00:49:21.892
ANY REDUCTION OF RATES FOR

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:23.527
ANYBODY IF THEY WERE NOT --

00:49:23.593 --> 00:49:25.896
ANTICIPATING A RATE INCREASE SO

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:27.164
WE JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.832
I KNOW MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:30.367

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:32.169
THAT THEY WOULD BE RECEIVING A

00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:34.671
RATE REDUCTION AND SO I I DID

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:36.106

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:07.023
LANGUAGE ALSO EXAMS THE

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.124
DEPARTMENT FROM HAVING TO FOLLOW

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:10.227
THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE IN

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:11.328
SETTING UP THOSE THIRD PARTY

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:12.462
CONTRACTS.

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:13.663
SO WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND WE

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:14.764
AGREE THAT IT PROBABLY MAKES

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:17.000
SENSE NOT TO USE THE HIGHER COST

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.335
OPTION UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:19.569
GENERAL SERVICES.

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:22.038
BUT WE PROPOSE CHANGING THE

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:24.074
LANGUAGE SLIGHTLY TO NOT EXEMPT

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.309
THE DEPARTMENT FROM THE PUBLIC

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:29.145
CONTRACT CODE -- SIMPLY -- HAVE

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:30.447
IT SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:31.615
WORK WITH THE GS.

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.416
SO IT'S A MINOR POINT ON ON THE

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:36.052
MOVE -- THE SECOND POINT HAS TO

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:37.754
DO WITH THE POPULATION AND

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:39.556
STAFFING ADJUSTMENT AT FAIRVIEW

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.992
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER -- HERE WE

00:52:42.058 --> 00:52:46.496
JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT --

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:47.130
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ONE

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:48.031
OF THE REASONS THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:50.166
HAS TO KEEP AN INTERMEDIATE CARE

00:52:50.233 --> 00:52:51.601
FACILITY UNIT.

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:54.304
OPEN IN TO TWENTY NINETEEN

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:54.838
TWENTY IS BECAUSE SEVERAL

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:56.673
RESIDENTS THAT HAD BEEN PLACED

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.807
IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE HAD TO

00:52:57.874 --> 00:52:58.408
MOVE.

00:52:58.475 --> 00:52:59.442
BACK TO THE FAIRVIEW

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:01.244
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND WE

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:02.312
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:03.613
TO THE DEPARTMENT WE CERTAINLY

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.181
UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PARTICULAR

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:07.817
INDIVIDUALS HAVE COMPLEX.

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:09.019
CHALLENGES -- SEVERE OF

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:11.187
BEHAVIORAL -- CHALLENGES TO

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:13.223
ADDRESS -- BUT WE DO HAVE SOME

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:14.925
CONCERNS THAT IT'S GOING TO COST

00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:16.293
AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:18.628
DOLLARS GENERAL FUND -- TO KEEP

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:22.799
THAT ICF UNIT OPEN -- AND IT'S

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:23.900
IT MIGHT BE WORTH HAVING SOME

00:53:23.967 --> 00:53:24.968
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:26.636
DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHAT LED TO

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:28.104
THESE RESIDENTS HAVING TO MOVE

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:29.839
BACK AND WHAT KINDS OF LESSONS

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:32.309
LEARNED MIGHT BE TAKEN INTO THE

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.043
FUTURE.

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:34.344
OKAY ON THE ISSUE OF THE

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:37.581
PROVIDER RATE ADJUSTMENT -- WE

00:53:37.647 --> 00:53:38.181
WOULD NOT THAT THE

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:39.849
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DOES

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.084
USE FINDINGS FROM THE RECENT

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.719
READ RECENTLY RELEASED RATE

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:44.454
STUDY IN A BENEFICIAL WAY TO

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:46.356
INFORM THE DESIGN OF THE

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:47.958
TEMPORARY RATE INCREASES.

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:49.993
AS DIRECTOR BARGE MEN NOTED IT

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.128
WOULD -- TARGET PROVIDERS IN THE

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:53.930
CATEGORIES THAT APPEAR TO HAVE

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.799
BEEN -- MOST UNDER FUNDED IN

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:58.401
RECENT YEARS -- IN ATTEMPTS TO

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:00.036
APPLY ADJUSTMENTS FOR REGIONAL

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:01.571
VARIATIONS IN COST AND IT

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:02.906
ATTEMPTS TO CREATE SOME PARITY

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:05.342
ACROSS PROVIDERS -- OF THE THE

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.277
SAME TYPES OF SERVICES IN THE

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:08.445
SAME TYPES OF AREAS.

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:09.813
HOWEVER WE DO HAVE FOUR KEY

00:54:09.879 --> 00:54:11.081
CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:54:11.147 --> 00:54:12.515
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH AND

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:13.450
NOTE THAT IT FUNDAMENTALLY

00:54:13.516 --> 00:54:15.085
MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:16.519
IMPLEMENTATION OF RATE REFORM IN

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:17.654
THE SYSTEM.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.488
AND IN FACT THIS WAS A

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:20.557
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY THAT LED TO

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:23.593
THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED RATE

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.127
STUDY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:25.562
FIRST OF THE FUNDING PROPOSAL IS

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:27.197
MODEST RELATIVE TO THE RATE

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.966
STUDIES IDENTIFIED FUNDING GAPS.

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.668
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:33.069
PROPOSED RATE INCREASE WHICH IS

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:34.504
ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:37.140
GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:37.774
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:38.308
AN ANNUAL BASIS.

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:40.243
FALLS FAR SHORT OF WHAT THE RATE

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.379
STUDY IMPLIES IS NEEDED IN THE

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:45.048
SYSTEM WHICH IS ABOUT ONE POINT

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.650
TWO BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND.

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:48.218
SECOND THE PROPOSED SUNSET OF

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:50.854
RATE INCREASES RAISES CONCERNS.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.089
THE REVISED BUDGET IN EFFECT

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:54.758
TREATS SERVICES THAT ARE FUND OF

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:56.993
FUNDAMENTALLY ONGOING IN NATURE

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.728
AS TEMPORARY WHICH ULTIMATELY

00:54:58.795 --> 00:55:00.964
CREATES PROGRAMMATIC CHALLENGES.

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:03.800
AND INCREASES COST PRESSURES.

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:04.901
THE TARGETED SERVICES FUNDED

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.636
WITH THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASES

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:08.838
WILL STILL BE NEEDED BY DDS

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:10.607
CONSUMERS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:11.908
IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.443
NOTES THAT ONE RATIONALE FOR THE

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.011
PROPOSED RATE INCREASES IS TO

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:16.746
STABILIZE CAPACITY IN

00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:17.914
RESIDENTIAL SERVICES.

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.683
AND TO STABILIZE CAPACITY OF THE

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.051
WORK FORCE IN OTHER SERVICE

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:22.085
CATEGORIES.

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:25.922
ENDING THE RATE INCREASES IN

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:26.523
TWENTY TWENTY TWO WOULD HAVE A

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:27.390
DESTABILIZING AFFECT.

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:28.458
OUR OFFICE IS NOTED IN ITS

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:30.093
INITIAL COMMENTS ABOUT THE

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.696
GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION -- THAT

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.998
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:36.399
SUNSETS ACROSS A VARIETY OF

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:38.068
PROGRAMS IN HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:39.235
SERVICES [inaudible]

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:40.904
IT AREAS.

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:42.505
AND THEY SUGGEST THIS TO

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:43.840
MAINTAIN A BALANCE BUDGET

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:45.075
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:49.512
ENDING. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:50.146
THREE OUR OFFICE HAS RAISED A

00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:51.414
NUMBER OF CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:53.016
APPROACH FINDING THAT THE MAYOR

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:54.517
REVISION UNDERSTATES THE TRUE

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:56.753
ONGOING COST OF ITS POLICY

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:57.954
COMMITMENTS.

00:55:58.021 --> 00:55:59.889
OUR THIRD CONCERN IS THAT THE

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:01.491
RATE INCREASE PROPOSAL LIMITS

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:03.460
THE SCOPE OF WHO BENEFITS FROM

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:04.961
THE FISCAL RELIEF PROVIDED.

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.896
WE SEE THE MERIT OF TARGETING

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:08.431
RATE INCREASES AS THE

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:09.766
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.735
BECAUSE TARGETING IS TYPICALLY A

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.136
MORE COST EFFICIENT METHOD.

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:14.437
THEN ACROSS THE BOARD RATE

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:16.573
INCREASES HOWEVER WE DO NOTE

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:18.007
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND SUB

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.609
EXCLUDING A LARGE SHARE OF

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:22.312
SERVICE PROVIDERS -- USING THIS

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.913
APPROACH.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.582
FINALLY WE NOTE THAT THE

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:28.118
PROPOSAL -- POSTPONES RATE

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:29.219
REFORM.

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:30.320
THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:32.489
RATE REFORM IS A EARLIER NOTED A

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.257
A PRIORITY IN THE DDS SYSTEM

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:35.825
IT'S THE REASON THAT IT CALLED

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:37.093
FOR THE RATE STUDY.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.027
AND IT'S THE REASON THAT IT'S

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:39.496
DELAYED DECISIONS ABOUT

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:40.730
INCREASING RATES IN THE

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.232
INTERVENING YEARS.

00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:43.333
THE ADMINISTRATION'S CURRENT

00:56:43.399 --> 00:56:44.667
PROPOSAL WELL INFORMED BY THE

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:47.170
RATE STUDY DOES NOT BEGIN TO

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:48.638
IMPLEMENT ANY OF THE RATE MODELS

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:50.473
SUCH AS THROUGH A STAGE ROLLOUT

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.775
OR THROUGH AND OR THROUGH PILOT

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:53.343
PROJECTS AS OUR OFFICE HAS

00:56:53.409 --> 00:56:54.711
SUGGESTED TO THIS BUDGET

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:56.546
SUBCOMMITTEE IN A LETTER.

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:58.148
DATED MAY SECOND.

00:56:58.214 --> 00:56:59.015
WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT IF

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:00.750
IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:03.486
ANY KIND IS NOT IS DELAYED THE

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:06.656
MOMENTUM TO BEGIN RATE REFORM

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:12.128
WILL BE LOST -- I WANTED TO

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:13.863
MENTION THAT I THAT ONE QUESTION

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.532
CAME UP HIS PERMIT WAS MAKING

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:16.699
ITS PRESENTATION.

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:18.535
IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING ON THE

00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:21.871
ISSUE OF THE AS THE CRISIS UNITS

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:23.907
THAT WOULD BE TEMPORARILY HOUSED

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:24.340
AT THE PORT OF BILL

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:25.508
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER.

00:57:25.575 --> 00:57:26.843
WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:30.547
FUNDING WOULD BE ONE TIME IN --

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:31.447
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE WAY

IT IT WAS JUST PRESENTED IT

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:34.617
SOUNDED AS THOUGH THAT COULD

00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:37.620
LAST FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS --

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:39.489
WE SUGGEST THAT YOU MAY WANT TO

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:41.257
CLARIFY THAT ISSUE BECAUSE

00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:42.926
AGREEING TO FUND -- THOSE

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:44.727

FUNDING IT.

FOR FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS IN

HALF THE BILLING WHICH WILL

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.181
CONTINUE TO HAVE IMPACTS WE WISH

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:13.449

HIGH COST REGIONS WHERE THE MAN

THROUGH THE RATE STUDY THERE IS

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:58.093
GOING TO BE -- A DECISION MADE

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.363
ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF SERVICES

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.531
PERFORM BEST ETCETERA ETCETERA

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:04.300
UNFORTUNATELY YES AS MUCH AS THE

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.634
MINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:06.936

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:09.038
OUR OVERALL PROBLEM IT IT CAN'T

01:10:09.104 --> 01:10:11.941
LEAVE OUT CERTAIN SERVICES THAT

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.576
ARE STILL VERY MUCH A PART OF

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:15.244
THE SYSTEM AND STILL CENTRAL THE

SYSTEM AS IT IS.

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:27.356
UNFORTUNATELY WE THINK THE

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:28.757
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL WILL

THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE OUTLINED

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:25.314
IN THE RATE STUDY IS THE

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:28.216
COMPLEXITIES OF KIND OF THE

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:29.584
HISTORY IN THE EVOLUTION OF

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:32.120

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.488
DIFFERENT EVENTS THAT HAVE

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.123
HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS WITHIN

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.792
THEIR RATES SO YOU WE HAVE.

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:38.493

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:43.298
STATUTORILY SET RATES WE HAVE

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:45.934
NEGOTIATED RATES -- WE HAVE SOME

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:47.569
NEW MODELS TO SERVICE YOU KNOW

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:49.571
THAT -- ACTUALLY ARE NOT WITHIN

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.106
KIND OF THE THE MEDIAN RATE

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:53.742
REQUIREMENTS OR THE RATE FREEZES.

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.310
SO OVER TIME THERE'S BEEN A

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:57.512
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAVE

01:16:57.579 --> 01:17:01.016
SET RATES AT DIFFERENT STAGES --

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.684
WHAT THE RATE STUDY DID IS

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:05.587
REALLY TOOK AT A LOOK AT -- A

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:06.755
PROCESS THAT WAS VERY

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.690
INFORMATIVE YOU KNOW IT LOOKING

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:10.659
AT WHAT ARE THE COSTS THAT BUILD

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.728
WITHIN THE DIFFERENT RATES OF

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.229
THOSE IN SCOPE SERVICES.

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.398
SO IT WAS KIND OF AS ZERO BE

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.633
SEEN IF YOU WILL AND LOOKING AT

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:21.169
HOW TO DEVELOP A RATE MODEL --

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.872
INTO DELIVERING A SERVICE SO I

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.040
DON'T KNOW IF IT.

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:25.974
IS NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.342
IN THE SENSE OF SAYING DOES IT

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:30.245
GO BACK AND AND TAKE CARE OF

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.014
ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.782
PAST OR TIMES WHERE THERE WERE

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:36.251
RATE FREEZES OR MEDIAN RIGHT.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.186
BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS KIND OF

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.588
ZERO BASED AND HAVE AN INFORMED

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:42.991
INFORMATIVE PROCESS OF BUILDING

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:44.626
A RATE MODELS.

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:45.227
SO I GUESS WHAT I WAS LOOKING

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:46.461
FOR IS I WANTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:47.529
OF THIS.

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.564
IS A RESTORATION OF RATE CUTS IT

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:50.999
MAY HAVE HAPPENED DURING THE

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:53.135
RECESSION.

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:54.936
AND THAT YET BUT WHAT WOULD GIVE

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.071
YOU TELLING ME AS ANYONE ZERO

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.739
THERE WERE NO -- IT WHERE THEIR

01:17:57.806 --> 01:18:00.008
RATE K..

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:01.977
AS SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS.

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:04.112
YOU GO TO ZERO YOU GONNA ZERO

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:06.248
BASE BASED ON NOW.

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:08.550
BUT I WANT TO I WANT TO KNOW YOU

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:11.153
KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE ARE THE

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:12.554
RATES BASED.

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:14.322
GOOD BE BASED ON IS ARE LOOKING

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:16.091
FOR HIM HOW MUCH HOW MUCH WAS

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:19.728
RESTORED OVER TIME -- OR OR WAS

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:21.530
IT.

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:22.964
MAYBE JUST MAYBE THE LA -- CAN

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.399
HELP ME THERE.

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:27.069
SO I'M NOT I MEAN I'M I'M CAN

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:29.004
HAVE OTHERS TRY.

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:29.571
TO IT IT IT MAKES TRYING TO

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:30.238
CLARIFY THIS BECAUSE I GUESS MY

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:31.139
I GUESS MY MY OVERALL POINT IS

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:32.207
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE UNIFORM

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:33.675
HOLIDAY SCHEDULE SUSPENSION FOR

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:36.278
EXAMPLE THAT WAS A RECESSION ERA

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:36.578
[inaudible]

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.580
POLICY CORRECT.

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:39.714
THERE WAS THAT WAS A RECESSION

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:41.116
ERA AND THERE WAS A NUMBER OF

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.851
THINGS THAT WERE RELATED -- TO

01:18:42.918 --> 01:18:44.119
ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN THAT

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:45.620
HAVE BEEN RESTORED OVER TIME

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.856
THERE WAS A REDUCTION BACK AND

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.158
DURING THE COST SAVING MEASURES

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:52.828
OF IF IT'S A YOU KNOW.

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:54.930
THERE IS A REDUCTION OF PROVIDER --

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.098
REDUCTIONS DURING THAT TIME I

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:58.066
THINK IT'S LIKE 4% THERE IS A

01:18:58.133 --> 01:19:00.001
REDUCTION THOSE A RESTORED THERE

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:00.669
ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:03.038
RESTORED -- THE UNIFORM HOLLIS

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:04.439
HOLIDAY IS SOMETHING THAT WERE

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:05.740
SUSPENDED WE'RE PROPOSING FOR

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.109
SUSPENSION RIGHT NOW THAT WAS A

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:10.078
PART OF THE THE TIME OF THE

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:11.746
ECONOMIC.

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:14.950
DOWNFALL -- AS FAR AS SEPARATING

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:18.753
OUT TO GET TO THE RATE STUDY.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.956
BECAUSE THAT WAS ABOUT ACTUALLY

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:25.427
DEVELOPING RIGHT MODELS BASED ON

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:28.530
SERVICE -- TO GET TO HOW DOES

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:31.066
THAT COMPARE -- TO THE HISTORY

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:33.435
OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS I'M NOT

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:35.370
QUITE SURE THERE'S THERE'S A

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.939
APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON THAT

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.107
CAN BE THERE.

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:39.741
WELL.

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:41.009
THE THEM I'M SORRY I'M NOT

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:42.911
TRYING TO MUDDY THE WATERS BUT I

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:45.747
GUESS IN GENERAL WE ARE IN.

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:47.749
FAIRLY GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES RIGHT

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:48.450
NOW.

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:52.354
WE HAVE -- RECORD SURPLUSES --

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.157
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:56.992
UNIFORM HOLIDAY SUSPENSION A

01:19:57.058 --> 01:20:02.597
RECESSION ERA POLICY -- THAT

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:04.866
WE'RE GOING TO KIND TO RESTORE.

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:06.635
SO AS WE START SPENDING MORE

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:08.403
MONEY ON A LOT OF ADDITIONAL

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.505
PROGRAMS OUT THERE MY POINT WITH

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:12.607
THIS IS THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:13.708
PROGRAM'S.

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:15.610
WEATHER'S RELATED TO SENIORS OR

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:17.779
WHATEVER THAT HAVE NEVER HAD

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:19.347
RATE RESTORATION WITH OR ARE

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:20.749
FUNDING RESTORED FROM THE

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:21.816
RECESSION.

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:24.519
AND SO THE UNCERTAINTY THAT THIS

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.288
KIND OF THIS CREATES HERE YOU

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:28.323
HEARING FROM FROM ADVOCATES

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.958
BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T THEY

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.593
DON'T WANT THE RUG PULLED OUT

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.094
FROM THEM IN A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:35.230
THEY THEY WANT SOME CERTAINTY.

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:36.798
I WAS WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:39.434
FRAZIER -- ON ON SATURDAY IN IN

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.536
EUREKA AND WE HAD A HEARING TO

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:44.272
HEAR FROM THE AYE DDS COMMUNITY.

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:47.075
AND THERE ARE SOE PRETTY SICK

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:47.742
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:48.443
RATE STUDY.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.111
I THINK EVERYBODY ASSUMES THAT

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.880
BECAUSE WE ARE IN A RURAL AREA

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:55.550
SOMEHOW THAT'S LESS EXPENSIVE

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:56.718
IT'S NOT.

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:57.519
AND SO ONE OF MY PROVIDERS TELLS

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:58.720
ME THIS RATE STUDY GOES THROUGH

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:00.655
THE WAY IT IS HE'S GONNA LOSE

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:02.123
35% WAS FUNDING HAVE TO CLOSE

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:05.060
THIS PROGRAM.

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:06.928
SO THERE IS STILL SOME I STILL

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:08.430
THINK THERE IS CONVERSATION

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:09.397
NEEDS TO HAPPEN ABOUT THE RACE

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:10.031
STUDY.

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:11.566
BUT I GUESS MY POINT MY POINT

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:13.301
HERE AND AND IS THAT

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:13.602
[inaudible]

01:21:13.668 --> 01:21:15.036
THAT.

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:17.339
THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:18.773
OUT HERE WHO HAVE HAVE HAVE A

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.542
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:21.276
FUNDING.

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:24.512
AND GOING FORWARD IN THIS.

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.948
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A CUTS CUTS

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:30.952
THE MUSTARD QUITE FRANKLY.

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:33.021
LET'S LET THE LA -- I THINK --

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:34.489
YEAH I WAS LOOKING AT ONE COME

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.591
INTO THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING AND

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:38.793
WHAT DIRECTOR PARCHMAN SAID --

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.996
THIS FEELS LIKE A RATE INCREASE

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:43.465
NOT A RESTORATION OF RATES I

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.367
MEAN THE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:47.369
SCHEDULE THE HALF DAY BILLING

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.371
THE SUSPENSION OF SOCIAL RECKON

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:50.705
CAMP SERVICES.

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:52.974
THOSE A RECESSIONARY CUTS THAT

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:57.312
HAVE NOT YET BEEN RESTORED --

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.146
AND THERE WAS A BIG GROUP YOU

01:21:58.213 --> 01:21:58.780
KNOW IT'S PRETTY SIZEABLE RATE

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:01.216
INCREASE THAT OCCURRED IN.

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:02.651
TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THE SAME TIME --

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:04.853
THIS PARTICULAR RATE INCREASE

01:22:04.919 --> 01:22:06.321
THIS PROPOSED THIS YEAR REALLY

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:08.290
BUILDS UPON EVEN THOUGH IT'S

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.258
INFORMED SOMEWHAT BY THE RATE

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:12.160
STUDY IT REALLY BUILDS UPON THE

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:14.796
CURRENT EXISTING RATE STRUCTURE

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:15.797
THE RATE FRAMEWORK AND RATE

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:17.599
SETTING METHODOLOGIES.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:19.301
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:20.802
IMPLEMENTING.

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.370
THE RATE MODELS.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.672
FROM THE RATE STUDY I MEAN IF

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:24.406
YOU WERE TO DO THAT AND

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:25.974
RESIDENTIAL SERVICES IT WILL

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:28.143
COST MORE LIKE SIX HUNDRED AND

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.277
SOMETHING.

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:30.745
MILLION GENERAL FUND.

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:32.380
THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:34.282
DOLLAR A PROPOSAL ACROSS A

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:35.617
VARIETY OF SERVICES.

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:38.053
SO IT'S IT'S NOT FULLY UTILIZING

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.522
THE RATE STUDY BUT I I WOULD SAY

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:41.523
IT'S A RATE.

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:42.757
INCREASE BASED ON OUR

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:44.259
UNDERSTANDING.

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:45.493
BUT IT IT ITSELF BUT IT IT

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.695
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S LEAVING OUT

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:50.231
SOME CRITICAL COMPONENTS SOME

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.299
SERVICES THAT.

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:52.934
THAT THAT ARE RELIED UPON --

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:54.936
THAT ARE GETTING ANY ATTENTION.

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.705
YEAH IT DEFINITELY TARGETS

01:22:56.771 --> 01:23:01.076
TARGETS THE FUNDING INCREASES.

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.510
YEAH IT WOULD JUST I THINK I

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:03.345
THINK YOU HEARD FROM THE

CONCERN.

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:07.375
POINT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GETTING

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:08.376
THE COMMENTS BACK.

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:09.744

01:24:13.114 --> 01:24:14.449
COUPLE OF YEARS AND THERE REALLY

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:16.785
DOES NEED TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL.

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.186
KIND OF CONVERSATIONS FROM A

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:20.488
BROADER PERSPECTIVE ALSO ON

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:23.358
THERE'S ONLY BEEN TWO RATE

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:25.126
INCREASES IN LAST TWENTY YEARS

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:25.427
[inaudible]

01:24:25.493 --> 01:24:25.760
SO [inaudible]

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:26.694
WHAT?

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:29.330
I MEAN WE WE CAN.

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.366
GO OVER OKAY HERE'S HERE'S THE

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:34.068
STUDY WHICH WE HAD ACTUALLY ASK

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:35.537
YOU TO BRING BACK TO US AND

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:39.874
MARCH WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED.

WHEN IT WHEN YOU GUYS WERE

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.844
SUPPOSED TO GO OVE THAT WITH US

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:43.978

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.419
SUNSETS.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:54.022
AND WE WE CAN GO INTO THE LOGIC

01:24:54.088 --> 01:24:56.057
OF THE CONVERSATION I I THINK

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.525
WHAT EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:59.627
ESPECIALLY ALL THE ADVOCATES AND

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:00.595
EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:02.096
AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE

01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:03.631
CONCERNED ABOUT PROGRAMS BEING

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:05.934
DROPPED OFF FOR THEIR LOVED ONES.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.902
IS [inaudible]

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:09.370
WHY?

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:11.706
IN THE WORLD.

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:13.441
ARE WE NOT JUST INCREASING IT

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:15.076
BACK TO WHAT IT IS.

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:16.811
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IN HEALTH

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:19.347
AND ON A CALL ON IT? TO ENSURE

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:21.049
THAT OUR RACE TAKING CARE.

01:25:21.115 --> 01:25:24.953
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MONEY.

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.688
IF I IF I COULD AS WELL TALK

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:27.789
ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:29.290
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:30.925
HAVE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT IN

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.260
IN OUR ENTIRE.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:33.728
KIND OF SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.297
AND AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:37.966
GROWTH THAT WE'RE HAVING.

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:39.200
IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:40.602
SERVING BUT ALSO THE GROWTH AND

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:41.870
I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:43.271
ADMINISTRATION OVER THE LAST

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:44.305
SEVERAL YEARS.

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:45.640
HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT SOME REALLY

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.942
IMPORTANT DECISIONS AS FAR AS

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:49.611
THE FUNDING WITHIN OUR SYSTEM.

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:51.212
THESE ARE WE HAVE THE

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.680
OPPORTUNITY THIS SUMMER TO HAVE

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.249
THIS BROADER DISCUSSION OF

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.750
SAYING WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:57.118
ARE INFLUENCING.

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:58.520
REALLY LOOKING AT THE COMMENTS

01:25:58.586 --> 01:25:59.988
BACK WITHIN THE RATE STUDY

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:00.755
TAKING A LOOK AT OUR

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.357
REIMBURSEMENTS TAKING A LOOK AT

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:03.491
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:06.160
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FROM THE LAST

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:08.263
COUPLE OF YEARS WE HAVE HAD A

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:09.697
YEAR OVER YEAR.

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.666
APPROVAL WITHIN OUR REGIONAL

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:16.704
CENTER SERVICE SYSTEM IT'S A

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:19.073
YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE ABOUT

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:19.707
SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:20.808
DOLLARS.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:23.311
FROM SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:23.912
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OR PROJECTED

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:26.347
AT ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:27.448
FORTY MILLION I THINK IT'S WAS.

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:28.683
TO MEET MAYBE A SLIGHTLY LESS

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:31.953
THAN THAT FROM.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:32.554
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO NINETEEN

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.121
TWENTY THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:34.088
THINGS THAT ARE CONTINUING TO

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:35.690
GROW WITHIN OF OUR EXPENDITURES

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:36.991
THAT'S GREATER THAN EVEN OUR

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:37.926
CASE LOW GROWTH.

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:39.127
I'M NOT MINIMIZING THE

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.562
IMPORTANCE OF WHAT OUR COMMUNITY

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:41.663
SAYING.

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:43.431
BUT WHAT I AM SAYING IS WE NEED

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:44.899
TO TAKE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:47.502
BACK HAVE A CONVERSATION.

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:49.270
TAKE A LOOK IN OUR TOTALITY OF

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:50.705
THE THINGS THAT ARE INFLUENCE IN

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:51.940
OUR SYSTEM.

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.875
SO WE CAN ALSO THEN HAVE SOME

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:55.376
IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS AS TO

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:57.979

THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AS

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.683
FAR AS THE OVERSIGHT WHERE THE

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:03.851
EXPENDITURES WHAT IS THE FUNDING

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:05.320
WHEN IS THE REIMBURSEMENTS.

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:06.688
AND THAT IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:07.989
BE TAKING THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:10.258
THIS SUMMER -- AND SO IN IN

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:12.260
ORDER TO SAY WHERE THAT THE

01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:14.429
TARGETED AREAS THAT THAT WE'VE

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:16.230
IDENTIFIED AS THOSE PRIORITY

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:18.666
AREAS IS WHAT WE PUT FORWARD IN

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:19.500
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:21.869
DIRECTOR WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:22.870
BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY IT FEELS

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:25.974
LIKE YOU'RE KICKING THE CAN DOWN

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:26.240
THE ROAD.

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:28.076
AND AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:32.614
AND I AGREE WITH -- ASSEMBLY

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.015

01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:51.666
THINGS OUT AND PUT SOME MORE

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.434
FUNDING IN THERE.

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.902
BECAUSE IT PRETTY SURE IT'S THE

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.804
WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GET

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:57.772
THAT THERE.

01:27:57.839 --> 01:28:01.142
ARE AT LEAST A LARGE MAJORITY OF

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:03.544

DO HAVE THE MONEY AND I DON'T

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.394

THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:11.879
QUESTIONS.

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:14.382
I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT -- WE'VE

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:15.717
ALL HAVE HEARD FROM.

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:17.518
MANY OF THE PEOPLE REGARDING

THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF THE MAY

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.088
REVISED.

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:22.356
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE -- AN

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:23.725
UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:25.126
THERE'S OUTRAGE.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:28.996
AT THE FACT THAT THE 8%.

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:31.132
AFTER THE RATE STUDY IS NOT

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.134
BEING INCLUDED.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.769
AS MR MATHIS SAID SPENT.

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:35.970
TWO THERE WERE ONLY BEEN TO RATE

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.138
INCREASES.

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.940
WHEN THIS MATTER WAS HEARD THE

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:40.641
HEARING ON MARCH SIXTH?

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:41.776
IT WAS PRESENTED BY ASSEMBLY

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:43.211
MEMBERS JIM FRAZIER AND CHRIS

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:44.512
HOLDEN.

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:45.980
AND THEY TALKED ABOUT A DOWN

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.582
PAYMENT.

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:48.116
THEN THE CONVERSATIONS CAN

01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:49.784
CONTINUE.

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:51.786
BUT IT WAS THE DOWN PAYMENT

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:53.688
BASED UPON THE RATE STUDY TO DO

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:59.961
THE 8% ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:30:00.027 --> 01:30:01.662
AND I QUOTE FROM FROM THEIR

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:03.631
TESTIMONY WAS TO ADDRESS THE

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:06.701
CRISIS IN COMMUNITY SERVICES.

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:08.536
SUFFICIENTLY STABILIZE THE

01:30:08.603 --> 01:30:10.872

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:13.374
FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO IMPLEMENT

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:14.609
BROADER REFORMS.

01:30:14.675 --> 01:30:16.244
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DOWN

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:17.078
PAYMENT.

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:19.480
THE THE THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW

01:30:19.547 --> 01:30:22.383
LOOKING AT SUN SETTING IT.

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:24.385
THE FACT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:25.920
INSTEAD OF STABILIZING IT.

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:27.655
WE IN ESSENCE ARE DESTABILIZING

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:28.756
IT.

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.391
ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:32.627
AND YOUR RIGHT DOCTOR WOULD IT

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:35.263
IT ISN'T THAT THERE WAS -- THAT

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:37.665
THERE WAS A REDUCTION IT'S JUST

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.467
THAT THEY WERE SO LOW.

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:45.840
THAT THERE WAS -- THE THE

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:46.941
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:49.076
CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED MORE

01:30:49.143 --> 01:30:52.013
THAN 8% SO EVEN AT THE 8%

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:53.347
EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:30:53.414 --> 01:30:55.750
TO CONTINUE AS YOU SAID WITH

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:57.785
THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:30:57.852 --> 01:30:59.987
BUT IT'S STILL AN ISSUE THAT

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.923
REQUIRES.

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:04.759
REQUIRED AND REQUIRES.

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:07.028
IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND I THINK

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:09.197
IF WE HAVE A RATE STUDY.

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:11.098
THE PROVIDES AT LEAST THE

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:12.934
INFORMATION WE NEED FOR NOW FOR

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:13.968
THE DOWN PAYMENT I THINK IT'S

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:16.304
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:17.805
THAT WE DO LOOK AT THAT.

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:19.607
OKAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ONGOING

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:21.042
BENEFITS.

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.710
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:24.779
IT'S ON GOING. TO PUT A SUNSET

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.215
ON IT.

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.317
NECESSARILY STATES THIS IS NO

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.952
LONGER AN ON GOING NEEDS OF THE

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:33.621
COMMUNITY WE KNOW THIS IS ONE OF

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:35.223
THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.

01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:37.959
THAT LEAST CAN AFFORD TO HAVE

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:39.060
CONTINUED DESPITE

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:43.764
DESTABILIZATION.

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.233
THE QUESTION IS IT BECAUSE AT

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:46.467
THAT POINT WE WOULD BE ROLLING

01:31:46.534 --> 01:31:47.902
BACK WE PUT A SUNSET WE'RE

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.437
ROLLING BACK AGAIN.

01:31:49.503 --> 01:31:51.005
I I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS

01:31:51.072 --> 01:31:54.642
FROM THE LA -- AND I I WOULD

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.310
LIKE TO HAVE HAVE YOU.

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:59.513
ADDRESS EACH OF THE THE CONCERNS

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:05.553
THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY THE LA L..

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.888
I MAY NEED SOME ASSISTANCE WITH

01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:08.155
WHAT THOSE WERE.

01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:09.724
A COUPLE OF MY DO I AM GOING TO

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:12.126
<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;O TO THE COUPLE THAT I I AM --&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.895
AWARE OF ONE IS THERE IS A

01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:16.464
COMMENT ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.399
THAT IT WOULD TAKE GOING BACK TO

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:19.934
THE FAIRVIEW.

01:32:20.001 --> 01:32:23.271
OR PORTED BILL WITH THE TEN

01:32:23.337 --> 01:32:24.338
INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD STAY AT

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.207
PORTER VILLE INTEL WE HAVE THE

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:27.508
COMMUNITY HOMES.

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.443
YOU KNOW WHILE WE ARE VERY

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:30.845
CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.747
DEVELOP HOMES IN THE TIME FRAME

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:34.949
WHEN I START TALKING ABOUT IN

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:36.150
GENERAL OF DEVELOPING A

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:37.184
COMMUNITY HOME.

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.719
I'VE HAD A LOT LAST SEVERAL

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:40.922
YEARS FOCUSED ON FOLKS MOVING

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.023
FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:43.324
IN DEVELOPING THAT COMMUNITY

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:45.026
HOMES AND RECOGNIZING SOME OF

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:46.694
THOSE DELAYS AND SO.

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:48.162
I AM KIND OF IN THIS THIS

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:49.730
PRACTICE OF SAYING THAT IT DOES

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:51.999
TAKE THIS TIME PERIOD BECAUSE

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:53.567
THAT IS SOMETIMES THE REST THAT

01:32:53.634 --> 01:32:54.568
HAPPENS.

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:56.704
HOWEVER BASED ON THE LOCATION

01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:58.739
AND BASED ON Và HOUSING GROUPS

01:32:58.806 --> 01:32:59.941
THAT WOULD BE LOOKING AT

01:33:00.007 --> 01:33:01.342
DEVELOPING THOSE RESOURCES THAT

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:03.678
I WOULD NOT ANTICIPATE DELAYS.

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:05.012
AND THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.480
IT WITHIN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:11.519
WOULD ANTICIPATE -- AND THEN IF

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:13.721
I CAN SO.

01:33:13.788 --> 01:33:15.489
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT A LITTLE BIT

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:20.094
SO NOW ON THE THE WAY YOU DRESS.

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:21.262
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE.

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:22.029
ALL OF THE ALL OF THE COMMENTS

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:23.798
ALL OF THE CONCERNS YOUR

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:24.899
QUESTIONS.

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:27.034
SO ON THE FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR A

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.202
MODEST RELATIVE TO THE RATE

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:31.505
STUDIES IDENTIFIED FUNDING GAPS --

01:33:31.572 --> 01:33:33.474
TAKING A LOOK AT YOU KNOW AND I

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.643
I GUESS ON ON SEVERAL OF THESE

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:36.877
WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE THE

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.546
SUNSET YOU KNOW WE'VE.

01:33:38.612 --> 01:33:40.047
YOU KNOW WHAT WE WHAT WE HEAR

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.782
YOUR CONCERNS AND BASED ON THE

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:43.484
OUT YOUR PROJECTIONS.

01:33:43.551 --> 01:33:45.119
YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:46.253
AS FAR AS A LIMITED SCOPE BUT

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.788
THE BENEFITS FOR THE FISCAL

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:48.723
RELIEF.

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.024
I GUESS I'M GOING TO JUST KIND

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:51.359
OF TAKE A STEP BACK AND TALK

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:53.060
THROUGH SOME OF THAT THE AREAS

01:33:53.127 --> 01:33:55.162
THAT WE DID FOCUS ON YOU KNOW

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:57.498
AND WHILE YOU KNOW I I I ALWAYS

01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:59.266
APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK THAT

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:01.202
THE LA -- DOES YOU KNOW THESE

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.636
ARE THE PERSPECTIVES THAT

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:04.805
THEY'RE PROVIDING TO US -- WHEN

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.774
WE TAKE A LOOK AT BEING ABLE TO

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:09.176
PRIORITIZE THE AREAS THAT WE DID

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:11.345
IT DOES GET TO SOME OF THE AREAS

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:13.948
THAT WE WERE INFORMED BY -- THE

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:15.316
RATE MODELS THAT WAS VERY

01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:17.618
HELPFUL AND SAYING HOW DO WE NOT

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:18.185
PERPETUATE.

01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:19.620
KIND OF THE THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:20.788
WE'VE HAD BETWEEN THE

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:22.056
DIFFERENCES OF REGIONAL CENTERS

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.891
AND PROVIDERS AND SO THE

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:25.860
PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORWARD.

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:28.496
AS FAR AS TAKING A LOOK AT THE

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:30.031
TARGETED AREAS USING THE

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:32.433
ALLOCATION -- THAT'S INFORMED BY

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.268
THE RATE STUDIES DOES MOVED THAT

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:37.571
NEEDLE INTO NOT HAVING KIND OF

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.607
THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAY ONE

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:40.708
REGIONAL CENTER IN ANOTHER

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:42.309
REGIONAL CENTER THAT MAY HAVE

01:34:42.376 --> 01:34:43.344
HAD SET RATES.

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:44.345
AT DIFFERENT.

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:46.213
LEVELS SO I CAN GIVE YOU AN

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.249
EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE IN

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:50.051
PERSONAL ASSISTANT SOME --

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:51.419
REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE A

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:53.054
RATE THAT MAY BE AT FORTY FIVE

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.455
DOLLARS AN HOUR WE HAVE OTHERS

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:55.923
THAT MAY BE AT THIRTEEN DOLLARS

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.724
AN HOUR.

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:58.793
THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT ISSUES

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.227
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:01.662
AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:03.064
WHAT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE.

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:04.598
THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO ADDRESS

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:07.234
THOSE -- AS FAR AS TAKING A LOOK

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:09.437
AT BEING ABLE TO THE CONCERNED

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:10.805
THAT ELLIE -- HAS PRESENTED AS

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:11.906
FAR AS DELAYING THE

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:13.941
IMPLEMENTATION OF MODELS ARE

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:16.043
DOING A PILOT AS FAR AS BEING

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:18.412
ABLE TO DO THAT ONE OF THE AREAS

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:19.046
THAT THAT.

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:21.849
I HAD SAID IS THAT WE DO WANT TO

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:26.053
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THIS

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.755
SUMMER IS TO IS BROADER

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:28.089
CONVERSATION.

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:28.856
AS FAR AS EVERYTHING THAT'S

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:29.857
RELATED TO THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:30.324
IMPACT IN OUR SYSTEM.

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:31.926
AND THAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE THE

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:33.060
COMMENTS THAT WERE GETTING BACK

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:35.329
FROM THE COMMUNITY ON OUR RATE

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:36.097
MODELS.

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:37.598
IT'S INCLUDING KIND OF THE

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.100
GROWTH IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:40.434
THE EXPENDITURES IN OUR

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:41.235
POPULATION GROWTH ARE

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:42.970
REIMBURSEMENTS BUT THEN ALSO

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:45.873
TAKEN A A TOTAL TOTAL LOOK INTO.

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.774
KIND OF THE REGIONAL CENTER

THE THE STEPS INTO SOME OF THE

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:01.422
AREAS THAT WE SEE IS IS PRIORITY

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:03.491
AREAS RECOGNIZING AGAIN THE GOOD

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:05.025
WORK THAT THE LA ALWAYS DONE IN

I'M HAVING A BENEFIT OF A

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:41.629
CONVERSATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:43.264
A CONVERSATION BUT THEY REALLY

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:45.299

POPULATION BUT WE'RE ALSO

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:05.853
SHOWING THAT OUR EXPENDITURE

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.689
GROWTH IS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT.

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:10.224
YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST FOUR OR

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:11.692
FIVE YEARS OUR EXPENDITURE

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:12.993
GROWTH AS COMPARED TO THE

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.496
POPULATION IS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:16.430
DIFFERENT.

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:18.165
YOU KNOW AND AND WE NEED TO

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:19.400
REALLY ALSO HAVE FURTHER

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:21.035
UNDERSTANDING INTO ALL OF THOSE

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.102
DIFFERENT PRESSURES SO WE CAN

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:26.740
&lt;c.red&gt;AVE IT -- FORWARD AS TO WHAT&lt;/c&gt;

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:30.077
THOSE NEXT STEPS ARE.

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:32.213
WE HAVE A RATE STUDY.

01:37:32.279 --> 01:37:33.314
THAT IS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.649
WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE SHELF

01:37:35.716 --> 01:37:38.619
LIFE OF THAT RATE STUDY.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.854
WELL THE WHEN.

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:42.590
THE MODELS THEMSELF ONE OF THE

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:44.291
BENEFITS OF THE MODELS THAT ARE

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:46.894
ACTUALLY THERE IS THAT IT IS A

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:50.331
VERY -- TRANSPARENT YOU KNOW BUT

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:51.599
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT

01:37:51.665 --> 01:37:52.766
THINGS OUT AND AND AGAIN LET ME

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:53.534
KIND.

01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:55.069
TO GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:56.704
BIT IS TO THE RIGHT MODELS IS

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:58.339
THAT IN EACH OF THE RATE MODEL

01:37:58.405 --> 01:38:00.074
SO SAY FOR RESIDENTIAL IT BREAKS

01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:01.275
DOWN.

01:38:01.342 --> 01:38:03.177
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF IT WHAT IS

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:05.546
THE WAGES AND COMPENSATION WHAT

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:07.648
IS THE COST OF KIND OF THE

01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:09.483
HOUSING WHAT IS THE COST OF

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.352
TRAINING WHAT IS THE COST OF YOU

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:12.653
KNOW THERE'S WORKER'S COMP

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.754
THERE'S DIFFERENT PIECES THAT

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:15.723
ARE BROKEN OUT SO YOU REALLY DO

01:38:15.789 --> 01:38:15.923
HAVE.

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:17.958
ELEMENTS THAT SHOULD THERE BE A

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:20.361
NEED FOR UPDATES FOR DIFFERENT

01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:22.296
ELEMENTS OF IT IT DOES HAVE THE

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:24.164
ABILITY TO BE UPDATED.

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:25.866
SO WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:27.534
RATE MODELS THEMSELVES THE

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:30.237
STRUCTURE OF THEM WERE DESIGNED

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:31.672
TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU KNOW THE

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.307
ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:34.541
AND EVERYTHING TO HAVE FUTURE

01:38:34.608 --> 01:38:35.643
CONVERSATIONS.

01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:36.910
YOU KNOW IF THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED

01:38:36.977 --> 01:38:39.113
OR EVEN WITH SAYING LET'S TAKE A

01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:41.048
LOOK AT SOME ADDITIONAL --

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.583
CONVERSATIONS IT DOES LEND

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:45.986
ITSELF TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:47.821
ADJUSTMENTS IF THAT WAS NEEDED.

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:48.289
BUT THE RATE STUDY WAS

01:38:48.355 --> 01:38:51.458
SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED. TO MAKE

01:38:51.525 --> 01:38:52.326
THOSE RATE CHANGES NOW IT

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:54.595
APPEARS.

01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:57.331
THE RATE STUDY WAS -- TO BE

01:38:57.398 --> 01:38:59.533
REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.737
IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR -- AND TO

01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:05.205
TO DETERMINE THAT WHAT THOSE

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:06.407
KIND OF DELIBERATE OF

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:08.909
DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE -- MOVING

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:10.711
FORWARD AND SO WE WERE WE WERE

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:11.945
REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:13.380
LEGISLATURE THIS RATE STUDY

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:15.082
CORRECT.

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:16.817
ANOTHER COMING FROM THE LA --

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:19.820
WAS THAT.

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.155
THE THE PROPOSAL.

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:23.123
AND IF I MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN THE

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:25.893
NOTES CORRECTLY BUT IT TREATS

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:27.027
ONGOING SERVICES.

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:29.496
AS IF THEY WERE TEMPORARY.

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:32.132
BUT THEY ARE TEMPORARY AND AGAIN

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:33.834
IT GOES BACK TO WHAT THE MEMBERS

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:35.636
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:37.237
DESTABILIZATION.

01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:41.108
OF THE DESTABILISATION PERIOD --

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:44.144
AND UNDERSTATES THE TRUE ON

01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:45.979
GOING COST.

01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:48.015
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:49.416
THE FACT THAT THIS IS BEING

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:50.417
TREATED AS IF IT WERE.

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:52.319
TEMPORARY.

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:53.454
BUT THESE COSTS ARE NOT

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.124
TEMPORARY.

01:39:57.191 --> 01:39:59.126
SO AGAIN MADAM CHAIR I THE THE

01:39:59.193 --> 01:40:01.128
IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE

01:40:01.195 --> 01:40:02.863
A PROPOSAL THAT IS IS PUT

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:04.998
FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE THE

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:06.633
IMMEDIATE ISSUES.

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.202
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:10.170
CONVERSATIONS THIS SUMMER I JUST

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:12.806
I DON'T WANT TO TO MINIMIZE.

01:40:12.873 --> 01:40:14.274
THE VALUE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:16.477
THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:21.014
GOING TO HAVE IN A TOTALITY.

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:23.317
FROM LA -- WHAT WERE THE OTHER --

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:25.152
THE OTHER.

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:26.053
TWO PROBLEMS THERE WERE FOUR

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.089
PROBLEMS.

01:40:29.156 --> 01:40:31.458
THE DIRECTOR IS ADDRESSED --

01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:33.460
THREE OF THOSE THE FINAL POINT

01:40:33.527 --> 01:40:34.261
WAS.

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:35.229
THE FACT THAT THE PROPOSAL

01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:37.664
LIMITS THE SCOPE OF WHO BENEFITS

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:40.000
FROM THE RATE INCREASES SO IT IT

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:41.034
DOES PROVIDE.

01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.337
TARGETED FISCAL RELIEF TO SOME

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:45.038
OF THE PROVIDERS THAT SORT OF

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:46.173
EMERGED FROM THE FINDINGS OF THE

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.243
RATE STUDY IS IN NEED OF OF RATE

01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:51.111
INCREASES BUT IT DOESN'T PROVIDE.

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:53.747
ANY LEVEL OF FISCAL RELIEF TO

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:54.281
THE OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:55.549
SYSTEM.

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:57.217
NO WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:59.119
CONCERN PLEASE.

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:01.388
YES THANK YOU -- WITH HE TAKING

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:03.690
A LOOK AT THE THE PROPOSAL THAT

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:07.995
WE HAVE WE AGAIN FOCUSED ON

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.596
REALLY THAT THE PRIMARY AREAS

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:11.532
THAT WE SAW INFORMED BY THE RATE

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:12.466
STUDY THAT HAD.

01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:15.869
SIGNIFICANT -- KIND OF COST

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:17.704
PRESSURES IF YOU WILL AS I HAD

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:19.206
MENTIONED WITH THE RESIDENTIAL

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:20.340
WE HAVE SEEN.

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:22.709
SPECIFICALLY THOSE SERVICES THAT

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:24.311
HAVE BEEN DECLINING YEAR OVER

01:41:24.378 --> 01:41:27.448
YEAR -- AND THEN ALSO WITH THE

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:28.882
AND I I CERTAINLY RESPECT THAT

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:30.551
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:32.719
SERVICES AND SERVICE MODELS THAT

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:33.487
ARE IN ALIGNMENT AND THAT WILL

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:36.056
BE IN COMPLIANCE AND CERTAINLY.

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:37.891
JUST WITH THAT NEW FEDERAL ROLE

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.593
WITH THE PROPOSAL OF SAYING THAT

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.862
WE HAVE THE TARGETED AREAS THAT

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.263
WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT ARE

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:44.998
CONSISTENT IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE

01:41:45.065 --> 01:41:46.967
FEDERAL RULE DOESN'T MEAN THAT

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:49.002
OTHERS WILL NOT BE -- BUT AT

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:49.903
THIS TIME THESE ARE THE

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.705
PROPOSALS THAT WE PUT FORWARD AS

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:53.740
THE PRIORITIES AND AGAIN IT'S

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:55.309
ADDRESSING THE RESIDENTIAL IT'S

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:57.077
ADDRESSING THOSE PROPOSALS OR

01:41:57.144 --> 01:41:59.179
THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE IN

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:01.048
ALIGNMENT WITH EIGHT CBS -- AND

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:02.683
THEN THE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT

01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:03.984
DO TOUCH THE NUMBER OF THE

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:05.686
DIFFERENT SERVICE MODELS AS A

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.454
SUPPLEMENTAL STAFFING -- AND

01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:09.289
THEN MAKING SURE THAT WITH THE

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:11.158
UNIFORM HOLIDAY SUSPENSION THAT

01:42:11.225 --> 01:42:13.260
THAT IS -- A PROPOSAL THAT DOES

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:16.330
TOUCH THE NON RESIDENTIAL

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:18.665
SERVICES.

01:42:18.732 --> 01:42:20.133
JUST ONE POINT ON THE ON THE

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.602
HOLIDAY SCHEDULE THAT DOES

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:23.670
AFFECT THE NON WE AGREE IT DOES

01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:25.272
AFFECT THE NON RESIDENTIAL

01:42:25.339 --> 01:42:26.740
SERVICE PROVIDERS BUT THE

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.075
HOLIDAY SCHEDULE HAS BEEN

01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:30.410
SUSPENDED SINCE.

01:42:30.477 --> 01:42:31.512
TWENTY FIFTEEN SO TO CONTINUE

01:42:31.578 --> 01:42:34.248
THAT SUSPENSION DOESN'T DO

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:36.250
ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:37.851
CURRENT WHAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:41.255
CURRENT -- BUDGET YEAR.

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:44.958
THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. TO LIKE TO

01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:46.994
RESPOND.

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:50.264
THAT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER OF OF

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.766
DAYS THAT HAVE BEEN PROJECTED.

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:54.601
I THINK THAT IS ACCURATE THAT

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:56.236
MANY OF THOSE DAYS THAT ARE

01:42:56.303 --> 01:42:57.604
PROJECTED HOWEVER THERE'S NOT

01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:59.339
ALL OF THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS I

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:00.474
THINK MANY OF THEM.

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:04.444
STILL MAY BE -- RECOGNIZING A

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:07.114
NUMBER OF KIND OF THOSE HOLIDAYS

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.416
OR OR DAYS OFF AND SO BEING ABLE

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:11.952
TO PROPOSE THEN LOOKING AT HOW

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:14.154
TO STANDARDIZE THAT THAT IS.

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:15.422
KIND OF LIFTING THAT.

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:17.124
GIVES THEM SOME ASSURANCE THAT

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:18.659
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

01:43:18.725 --> 01:43:20.561
HANGING OVER THEIR HEAD -- WHICH

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:23.063
I THINK WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:23.664
COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN A GREAT

01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:25.098
CONCERN.

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:27.834
WIRE THE FUNDS FOR THE STATE AND

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:29.503
REGIONAL CENTERS ON GOING.

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.104
SO THOSE ARE FUNDS THAT WE WOULD

01:43:31.171 --> 01:43:32.673
SEE THAT WOULD STILL PROVIDE THE

01:43:32.739 --> 01:43:35.042
OVERSIGHT TO THE SYSTEM THAT

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:37.344
WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE -- SO IN

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:39.546
THE INSTANCE OF THE OVERSIGHT OF

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:41.181
THE REGIONAL CENTER AS FAR AS

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:43.750
THE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE INTO

01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:46.186
THE SYSTEM -- THAT WOULD BE AN

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:47.721
AREA THAT WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE

01:43:47.788 --> 01:43:48.822
AND THEN ALSO WITH THE

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:50.190
PROJECTION THAT WE HAVE THAT ALL

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:52.893
TALK ALSO ON THE ISSUE SIX ONE

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.094
OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:55.228
IDENTIFIED.

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:57.764
WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

01:43:57.831 --> 01:43:59.600
THE SUPPORT A LIVING PROVIDERS

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:01.535
AND A COUPLE OF THEM AS FAR AS A

01:44:01.602 --> 01:44:03.136
REQUIREMENT FOR BACKGROUND CHECK.

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:04.304
THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE WOULD

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:06.206
REQUEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT WOULD

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:09.142
BE TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS --

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:10.377
TO DO THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS ON

01:44:10.444 --> 01:44:11.945

THANK YOU A QUESTION TO FINANCE

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:19.586
[inaudible]

01:44:19.653 --> 01:44:21.688
WHY?

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:23.123
WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:26.460
SELECT THESE LAST TWO PROGRAMS

01:44:26.526 --> 01:44:30.430
[inaudible] FOR SUNSET.

01:44:30.497 --> 01:44:31.398
ALL.

01:44:31.465 --> 01:44:32.299

01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:41.241
VISION WE DO HAVE -- A REVENUE

01:44:41.308 --> 01:44:46.480
PROBLEM IN THE OUT YEARS THAT IS

01:44:46.546 --> 01:44:47.881
ONE FACTOR AND I THINK THE OTHER.

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:50.150
FACTORS THAT THIS IS A A VERY --

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:53.720
FAST GROWING -- PROGRAM --

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:55.722
SIMILAR TO THE OTHER PROGRAMS

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:57.991
THAT WERE IDENTIFIED -- IN THE

01:44:58.058 --> 01:44:59.693
MAY REVISION.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.294
AND I THINK WITH WHAT WHAT THIS

01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:02.996
GOVERNOR'S REALLY STRESSING

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.498
THESE ARE PRIORITIES FOR HIM BUT

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:06.066
WHAT HE HAS REALLY BEEN

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:07.834
STRESSING IS. TO MAKE SURE WE

01:45:07.901 --> 01:45:09.636
HAVE OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:11.438
AND ARE ABLE TO WEATHER A

01:45:11.505 --> 01:45:14.941
RECESSION -- WHICH YOU KNOW.

01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:16.677
IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET BUT

01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:19.112
LIKELY IS COMING AT SOME POINT

01:45:19.179 --> 01:45:20.814
IN -- IN THE YOU KNOW NEAR

01:45:20.881 --> 01:45:24.418
FUTURE -- AND I THINK IT'S EVEN

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:26.586
BEEN MENTIONED -- AS PART OF

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:28.088
THEIR MAY REVISION OVERVIEW HE

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:30.490
GAVE THAT I MEAN WE CALIFORNIA

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:32.726
IS STANDS TO LOSE.

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.061
IT COULD BE UP TO SIXTY BILLION

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:37.431
IN IN REVENUES -- DURING A

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:38.865
RECESSION SO.

01:45:38.932 --> 01:45:40.634
HE WANTS TO CONTINUE WE WANT TO

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:43.870
CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A A ROBUST

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:46.840
RESERVE FOR EMERGENCIES AND

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:49.276
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE -- YOU

01:45:49.342 --> 01:45:51.244
KNOW WHAT THERE ARE SOME AREAS

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:53.480
WHERE WE'VE WE'VE HAD -- TO PULL

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:57.117
BACK -- ON PERMANENCY -- WE'RE

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:58.652
HOPING IN THE FUTURE THAT THAT

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.020
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO GO

01:46:00.087 --> 01:46:03.090
DOWN THIS PATH BUT AT THIS POINT --

01:46:03.156 --> 01:46:05.258
THESE THESE SEVERAL PROGRAMS

01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:08.028
WHERE WE'VE -- PROPOSED THAT THE

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:11.231
SUNSET -- YOU KNOW THERE THE IT

01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:12.599
IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE TWO

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:14.401
ISSUES ONE IS THE REVENUES AND

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:16.203
ONE IS HOW CAN WE WORK START

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.537
CONTAINING COSTS IN THESE

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:18.939
PROGRAMS.

01:46:19.005 --> 01:46:21.341
SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE -- TO

01:46:21.408 --> 01:46:22.709
THE PROGRAMS BUT AT A AT A

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:26.146
HIGHER QUALITY BUT WITH MORE

01:46:26.213 --> 01:46:28.815
COUNT ABILITY.

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:30.183
THE THE THE FOR STATEMENT THAT

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.718
YOU MADE WAS RIPPED THERE'S A

01:46:31.785 --> 01:46:35.388
REVENUE PROBLEM IN OUT YEARS.

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:37.657
IT'S CLEAR THAT IF WE DO HAVE

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:40.026
REVENUE PROBLEMS IN OUT YEARS

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:40.727
THERE WILL HAVE TO BE

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:42.729
ADJUSTMENTS JUST LIKE THERE WERE

01:46:42.796 --> 01:46:43.997
IN.

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:44.664
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN NOT JUST ON

01:46:44.731 --> 01:46:45.699
THIS PROGRAM BUT ON SO MANY

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:47.467
PROGRAMS.

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:49.035
THE NEED IS NOW.

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:50.604
AND THE NEED FOR THE NEED FOR

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.072
THE FUNDING IS NOW ON THE NEED

01:46:52.139 --> 01:46:55.909
FOR THE STABILIZATION IS NOW --

01:46:55.976 --> 01:46:59.346
SO THE THE THE THE FACT THAT

01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:01.314
THAT THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT

01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:07.020
REVENUE IN OUT YEARS -- I'M

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:08.789
SORRY IT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:10.323
NEW HERE.

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:11.792
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:14.027
DOCTOR WOULD MAKE THAT COMMENT

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:16.830
THAT -- THAT WE'RE WE'RE IN

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:18.465
WE'VE GOT THE SURPLUS WE BELIEVE

01:47:18.532 --> 01:47:19.966
THERE THERE WITH THIS IS THE

01:47:20.033 --> 01:47:21.301
TIME IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE

01:47:21.368 --> 01:47:23.804
THE SERVICES. TO SHOW WHAT

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:25.372
CALIFORNIA IS ALL ABOUT.

01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:26.840
WE DO TAKE CARE OF THE MOST

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:28.842
VULNERABLE WE DO TAKE CARE OF

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:30.844
OUR COMMUNITY THAT IS THAT HAS

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:32.579
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:34.114
TAKE CARE OF THE COMMUNITY THAT

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:38.418
HAS BEEN WAITING. FOR YEARS. FOR

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:39.019
US TO BE IN THE POSITION WE'RE

01:47:39.085 --> 01:47:40.187
IN NOW.

01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:41.788
THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:44.257
AND SO WHEN WHEN I GET THE THE

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:47.594
THE THE THE LETTERS AND THE

01:47:47.661 --> 01:47:49.362
EMAILS AND THE CALLS.

01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:51.364
ABOUT THE OUTRAGE SPECIFICALLY

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:53.300
ON THIS.

01:47:53.366 --> 01:47:55.268
I'VE GOT TO TELL THE COMMUNITY.

01:47:55.335 --> 01:47:57.304
I AGREE WITH YOU.

01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:59.005
I'M OUTRAGE.

01:47:59.072 --> 01:48:01.374
TO BECAUSE THIS IS THE TIME IF

01:48:01.441 --> 01:48:03.376
THERE'S EVER A TIME THIS IS THE

01:48:03.443 --> 01:48:06.079
TIME TO FIND A WAY TO TAKE CARE

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:07.480
OF THE COMMUNITY.

01:48:07.547 --> 01:48:09.015
THAT AS I SAID AS BEEN WAITING A

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:10.884
LONG LONG TIME.

01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:13.153
SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT REVENUE

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:14.955
PROBLEMS IN THE OUT YEARS ARE

01:48:15.021 --> 01:48:18.625
THERE -- IT'S VERY SPECIFICALLY

01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:20.760
THESE THESE ARE THE TWO PROGRAMS

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:22.996
THAT YOU FEEL THAT.

01:48:23.063 --> 01:48:26.132
NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE SUNSET OR

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:27.834
IS THERE GOING TO BE AN

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:31.004
EVALUATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:32.239
TO REMOVE THE SUNSET.

01:48:32.305 --> 01:48:34.174
I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS -- AN

01:48:34.241 --> 01:48:37.244
EVALUATION PROCESS ON GOING --

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:39.112
AT THIS TIME THIS IS THIS IS THE

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:40.947
PROPOSAL I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:42.716
I MEAN THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:48:42.782 --> 01:48:44.184
PROPOSINGINCREASES.

01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:47.254
AT THIS TIME -- SO.

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.356
YOU KNOW IT IT IT REALLY COMES

01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:51.057

BUDGET YEAR PLUS -- THREE SO --

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.734
YOU KNOW THE OUTLOOK IS NOT GOOD

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.769
IN THOSE YEARS OF COURSE AS AS

01:49:02.836 --> 01:49:04.771
WE GET CLOSER WE WILL NEED TO

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:05.505

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:10.477
PROJECTIONS WILL CHANGE AND THAT

01:49:10.543 --> 01:49:11.811
WILL TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.380
I MEAN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

01:49:13.446 --> 01:49:15.115
WE WE CAN SAY NOW THAT WE CAN

01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:18.418
AFFORD THESE INCREASES FOR YOU

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:20.320
KNOW. TWO FULL YEARS AND AFTER

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:24.891
THAT WE CAN'T AND THERE'S A LOT

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:25.525
I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

01:49:25.592 --> 01:49:25.759
OTHER.

01:49:25.825 --> 01:49:27.160
YOU KNOW PROGRAMS THAT WILL HAVE

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:28.561
TO LOOK AT IF WE DO RUN INTO A

01:49:28.628 --> 01:49:31.298
RECESSION -- YOU KNOW.

01:49:31.364 --> 01:49:33.900
WELL I I I THINK THE IDEA THAT

01:49:33.967 --> 01:49:35.702
WE HAVE BEEN WE STRIVE TOWARDS

01:49:35.769 --> 01:49:36.770
IS.

01:49:36.836 --> 01:49:37.871
YOU KNOW WE WOULD WE WOULD

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:40.373
RATHER BE UP FRONT NOW THAT THAT --

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.375
REDUCTIONS MAY BE MAY BE COMING

01:49:42.442 --> 01:49:44.110
RATHER THAN HAVING TO TURN

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:45.879
AROUND AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:47.547
REDUCTIONS.

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:50.517
IN IN FUTURE YEARS WHICH STILL

01:49:50.583 --> 01:49:53.553
MAIN HAVE TO HAPPEN.

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:55.155
THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD.

01:49:55.221 --> 01:49:59.759
YEAH I I GUESS I AM I I GUESS I

01:49:59.826 --> 01:50:02.662
CONCEPT OF SUNSET -- UP THERE WE

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:04.364
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO BUDGET

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:06.433
ADJUSTMENTS GOING FORWARD THERE

01:50:06.499 --> 01:50:08.368
I THINK PART OF THE ANGST FOR ME

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.036
IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE SAYING.

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.404
THAT THESE ARE GOING TO SUNSET

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:14.207
SO YOU ARE CREATING UNCERTAINTY.

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:16.910
WE JUST SAW. SIXTEEN POSITIONS

01:50:16.977 --> 01:50:18.011
THAT WERE ASKED FOR BY THE

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:20.046
ADMINISTRATION -- FOR SUPPORT

01:50:20.113 --> 01:50:21.247
FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN HURT SIR

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:22.449
SERVICES AGENCY.

01:50:22.515 --> 01:50:24.150
ARE WE TELLING THOSE NEW SIXTEEN

01:50:24.217 --> 01:50:25.352
EMPLOYEES THAT YOUR JOB MAY

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:28.922
SUNSET.

01:50:28.989 --> 01:50:30.256
I'M I'M YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:31.191
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REVENUE IS

01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:32.292
GOING TO BE BUT YET WE'RE

01:50:32.359 --> 01:50:34.594
TELLING OTHER PROVIDERS OUT HERE

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:36.496
THAT THIS THIS MAY THIS MAY

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:38.098
SENSE I DO YOU DO YOU SEE WHAT

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:38.298
THAT.

01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:40.200
UNCERTAINTY CON BECAUSE I I I I

01:50:40.266 --> 01:50:42.102
SEE I SEE YOUR POINT --

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:43.970
DEFINITELY I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

01:50:44.037 --> 01:50:45.939
THESE ARE AGAIN AREAS PROGRAMS

01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:48.375
THAT ARE GROWING EXPONENTIALLY.

01:50:48.441 --> 01:50:50.343
AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:51.811
ANYBODY AT THE TABLE AT LEAST

01:50:51.878 --> 01:50:54.447
WOULD DISAGREE THAT THAT THIS IS

01:50:54.514 --> 01:50:56.149
THIS PROGRAM PLACES NEVER CAN'T

01:50:56.216 --> 01:50:58.585
PRESSURE ON ON THE STATE'S

01:50:58.651 --> 01:51:00.653
GENERAL FUND NOT TO SAY THAT

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.722
THAT IS NO WAY -- INTENDED TO

01:51:02.789 --> 01:51:04.424
MEAN THAT IT'S NOT AN IMPORTANT

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:06.059
PROGRAM THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:07.794
VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS IS.

01:51:07.861 --> 01:51:09.696
A VERY GOOD PROGRAM THAT DOES

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:12.098
LOTS OF YOU KNOW HELPS LOTS OF

01:51:12.165 --> 01:51:13.800
PEOPLE BUT THE FACT OF THE

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:15.869
MATTER IS IS THAT WE WE HAVE TO

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:16.836
LIVE WITHIN.

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:19.139
THAT THE REVENUE STRUCTURE THAT

01:51:19.205 --> 01:51:20.707
WE HAVE AT THIS POINT.

01:51:20.774 --> 01:51:21.808
I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU

01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:23.743
THAT WE WILL YOU KNOW THINGS

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:25.111
WILL CHANGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:51:25.178 --> 01:51:26.212
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS AT THIS

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:28.648

HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS SHORTLY

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:47.734
BUT AS TO THE PAST I THINK IT'S

01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:49.469
A FAIR QUESTION AND I THINK FOR

01:56:49.535 --> 01:56:51.070
US AND HOPEFULLY FOR THE

01:56:51.137 --> 01:56:54.374
ADMINISTRATION TO TO LOOK AT HOW

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.275
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE.

01:56:56.342 --> 01:56:59.145
IS IS BEING ADDRESSED.

01:56:59.212 --> 01:57:02.615
SO CAN WE GET THAT.

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:03.516
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS A

01:57:03.583 --> 01:57:05.251
WEEK WE WILL WE WILL LOOK INTO

01:57:05.318 --> 01:57:06.552
IT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF

01:57:06.619 --> 01:57:08.654
THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF

01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:10.289
PROPOSING INCREASES THAT THEN

01:57:10.356 --> 01:57:13.126
SUNSET -- BUT THERE HAVE BEEN

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:17.530
RATE -- REDUCTIONS -- IN THE

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:20.066
PAST -- YOU KNOW IN A ACROSS

01:57:20.133 --> 01:57:22.535
SEVERAL PROGRAMS -- IN ON THE

01:57:22.602 --> 01:57:24.137
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES --

01:57:24.203 --> 01:57:25.271
WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:57:25.338 --> 01:57:27.306
SERVICES AREA SO I THINK THAT

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:29.242
THE THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT

01:57:29.308 --> 01:57:30.443
WE ARE WE ARE ACTUALLY

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:33.479
PROJECTING -- A DECLINE IN

01:57:33.546 --> 01:57:34.547
REVENUES THAT WE WEREN'T

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:37.216

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:39.318
JANUARY BUDGET AND THAT HAS IS

01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:42.455
WHAT IS -- SORT OF WHY WE'VE HAD

01:57:42.522 --> 01:57:45.291
TO PAY FOR IT -- TO TO YOU KNOW

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:47.260
LIVE WITHIN THOSE -- LIVE WITHIN

01:57:47.326 --> 01:57:48.361
THE REVENUES THAT.

01:57:48.428 --> 01:57:49.829
WE'RE PROJECTING WILL BE

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:52.832
AVAILABLE DURING THOSE LATER

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:55.501
YEARS I THINK.

01:57:55.568 --> 01:57:56.936
I THINK THAT IT IS ONE OF THE

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:57.970
PROBLEMS IS THAT IT MAY SET A

01:57:58.037 --> 01:57:58.271
PRECEDENT.

01:57:58.337 --> 01:58:00.339
AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WHEN

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:02.942
WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR BUDGET.

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:04.210
THAT.

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:07.346
IF WE ARE IN THE IN.

01:58:07.413 --> 01:58:08.514
GOOD TIMES.

01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:11.484
THAT THE BUDGET REFLECT.

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:14.387
THAT WE ARE IN IN THE SURPLUS --

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:17.757
AS OPPOSED TO BEING A SURPLUS WE

01:58:17.824 --> 01:58:18.324
TALK ABOUT.

01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:21.427

02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:14.874
ITEMS THAT ARE ON THE

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:16.508
DEPARTMENT'S DASHBOARD SO IT

02:05:16.575 --> 02:05:17.776

ANYBODY IN THEIR COMMUNITY IS

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:21.113
LOOKING FOR INFORMATION THAT

MEASURES AND TRANSPARENCY.

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:26.151
THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SEEN WHAT

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:27.853
IS AVAILABLE FOR THEIR REGIONAL

STATE TO THE DEPARTMENT.

02:05:30.656 --> 02:05:32.658
SO THERE CAN BE A COMPARISON TO

02:05:32.725 --> 02:05:33.959
OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS.

02:05:34.026 --> 02:05:35.160
ON THE MOVING TO BOARD

THE BOARD WOULD.

02:05:44.837 --> 02:05:46.438
MEET WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND

02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:48.007
UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:49.708
DIRECTOR IS THAT IF IN THE EVENT

02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:51.777
THAT WE NEED TO MEET WITH THE

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:53.445
BOARD WITHOUT IN ANY EMPLOYEES

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:54.847
AT THE REGIONAL CENTER THAT THAT

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:55.614
WOULD BE.

02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:57.549
AVAILABLE TO US AND WE COULD --

02:05:57.616 --> 02:05:59.151
COORDINATE THAT.

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:01.086
THE OTHER IS THE BOARD EXPERTISE --

02:06:01.153 --> 02:06:03.122
EXPANDING THE BOARD EXPERTISE TO

INCLUDE A FINANCIAL -- EXPERT ON

02:06:05.624 --> 02:06:06.792
THE BOARD RIGHT NOW THAT THAT IS

02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:08.794
NOT A REQUIREMENT SO WE WOULD

02:06:08.861 --> 02:06:11.697
NOT BE LOOKING -- TO CHANGE

02:06:11.764 --> 02:06:13.265
ANYTHING ELSE RELATED TO THAT WE

02:06:13.332 --> 02:06:15.234
WOULD HOWEVER PROVIDE THE OPTION

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:17.102
FOR THE BOARDS -- TO HAVE

02:06:17.169 --> 02:06:18.904
SOMEBODY AT THAT HAS EXPERTISE

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:20.773
IN BOARD GOVERNANCE -- IN

02:06:20.839 --> 02:06:22.841
ADDITION -- TO WITH MANAGEMENT

02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:23.809
SO THEY COULD CHOOSE BETWEEN

02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:25.411
MANAGEMENT BOARD GOVERNANCE SO

02:06:25.477 --> 02:06:26.912
WE WERE JUST LOOK TO KIND OF

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:28.414
PROFESSIONAL LICENSE CHANGE THE

MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. TO ADDRESS

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:31.250
SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:32.818
BELIEVE THAT WOULD ENHANCE ON

02:06:32.885 --> 02:06:34.920
THE BOARD GOVERNANCE -- LEGAL

02:06:34.987 --> 02:06:36.388
COUNSEL CONFLICT OF INTEREST

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:38.357
CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT

02:06:38.424 --> 02:06:41.660
THIS WOULD CLARIFY AS FAR AS THE

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:43.095
LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF THE

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:44.563
BOARD THAT THAT WOULD BE

02:06:44.630 --> 02:06:47.199
INDEPENDENT OF AN EMPLOYEE -- OF

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:48.801
THEIR REGIONAL CENTER AND SO IT

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:50.169
COULD GOES IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:51.337
CURRENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST

02:06:51.403 --> 02:06:56.075
THAT THE BOARD ANYBODY THAT'S ON

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:57.343
THE BOARD DOESN'T HAVE ANY --

02:06:57.409 --> 02:06:58.410
FIDUCIARY BENEFIT YOU KNOW IN

02:06:58.477 --> 02:06:59.812
ANY RELATIONSHIP SO WE WOULD

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:01.280
EXTEND THATTHEN AND SAYING THAT

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:04.116
THE LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE BOARD

02:07:04.183 --> 02:07:05.884
THEN WOULD ALSO HAVE -- TO HAVE

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:08.220
SOME -- CONFLICT FREE --

02:07:08.287 --> 02:07:09.655
RELATIONSHIP AND THAT WOULD

02:07:09.722 --> 02:07:12.191
INCLUDE THAT AND NOT HAVING --

02:07:12.257 --> 02:07:13.726
BE AN EMPLOYEE OF THE REGIONAL

02:07:13.792 --> 02:07:15.294

02:07:15.361 --> 02:07:17.396
THE LAST -- FEW ITEMS AS WITH

02:07:17.463 --> 02:07:19.898
CONSUMER SAFETY AND TRANSPARENCY

02:07:19.965 --> 02:07:21.200
WITH KIM CONSUMER SAFETY HADN'T

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:22.801
MENTIONED THAT -- EARLIER IS

02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:24.670
THAT WE WOULD SEE TO HAVE WITHIN

02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:26.271
SOME OF OUR SERVICES THAT ARE

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:27.906
NOT LICENSED ENTITIES ARE FAMILY

02:07:27.973 --> 02:07:29.842
HOME AGENCIES THERE'S NOT A

02:07:29.908 --> 02:07:31.176
REQUIREMENT FOR A BACKGROUND

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:31.777
CHECK.

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:34.113
SO FOR THOSE -- AREAS THAT WE

02:07:34.179 --> 02:07:35.981
HAVE TARGETED FOR THE RATE

02:07:36.048 --> 02:07:38.384
ADJUSTMENT -- WHILE WE ARE

02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:39.952
FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT MOST OF

THEM ARE HAVING THEIR STAFF --

02:07:42.588 --> 02:07:44.523

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:45.891
DO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT PART OF

THE REQUIREMENT SO FOR THESE --

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:50.596
AREAS THAT DO NOT HAVE A

02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:51.864
REQUIREMENT THAT WE WOULD BE

02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:53.799

FORTH IN THE FUTURE -- HEALTH

AND SAFETY THAT IT WOULD GIVE

02:08:01.573 --> 02:08:03.275
THE DIRECTOR AUTHORITY.

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:04.810
TO REQUIRE THE REGIONAL CENTERS

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:05.978
TO TAKE ACTION FOR THE HEALTH

02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:07.312
AND SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS THAT

02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:08.647

INCIDENTS ARE ACTIONS -- THAT

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:24.630

POINTS RAISED IN THAT IN THAT

02:10:30.522 --> 02:10:32.391
FINAL PIECE OF TRAILER BILL --

02:10:32.457 --> 02:10:34.893
WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEPARTMENTS

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.195
OVERSIGHT ROLE?

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:38.530
WE JUST HAVE TO INITIAL CONCERNS

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:41.433
BASED ON A PRELIMINARY A REVIEW.

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:43.368
OF THE FACT SHEET -- AND IT'S

02:10:43.435 --> 02:10:44.736
PRIMARILY TO DO WITH THE FUNDING

02:10:44.803 --> 02:10:46.905

AGENDA -- THERE I FUNDING FOR

02:10:55.881 --> 02:10:58.183

RATE THAT WILL THEN SUNSET SO.

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:11.330
IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHY ALL OF

02:11:11.396 --> 02:11:12.664
THE FUNDING NEEDS TO BE ON GOING

02:11:12.731 --> 02:11:13.999
I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:15.534
FUNDING SHOULD BE ON GOING TO DO

02:11:15.601 --> 02:11:18.870
SOME OF THESE OVERSIGHT TASKS

02:11:18.937 --> 02:11:19.771
BUT IF THE RATES TRULY WERE

02:11:19.838 --> 02:11:20.072
[inaudible]

02:11:20.138 --> 02:11:21.373
A TEMPORARY.

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.309
A RATE THAT SUNSETS THEN WHY

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:25.844
WOULD THEY NEED ADDITIONAL --

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:27.212

IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE RATES

02:11:29.414 --> 02:11:29.881
IT'S SORT OF A RHETORICAL

02:11:29.948 --> 02:11:31.316
QUESTION.

02:11:31.383 --> 02:11:32.684

02:14:58.690 --> 02:14:59.758

AND SO THEREFORE ALL THE THINGS

02:15:08.133 --> 02:15:09.367
WE HAVE TO DO ARE BASED UPON

02:15:09.434 --> 02:15:10.902
WHAT THE STATE WILL ALLOW FOR US

02:15:10.969 --> 02:15:11.770

LENS THE WORK FORCE ITSELF IS

02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:17.409
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO

SOME COMMUNITIES IN SOME

02:15:44.936 --> 02:15:46.137
REGIONAL CENTERS PROBABLY

02:15:46.204 --> 02:15:49.174

[inaudible]

02:16:05.423 --> 02:16:07.659

02:16:07.726 --> 02:16:08.894
IS SHOULD THERE SHOULD BE A

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:10.829
FLOOR THERE THERE SHOULD BE SOME

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:12.531
OPPORTUNITY FOR FLEXIBILITY

02:16:12.597 --> 02:16:14.699
BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT IN

02:16:14.766 --> 02:16:15.834
HUMBOLDT COUNTY.

02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:17.435

RELY ON ONE ANOTHER THROUGH A

02:16:20.739 --> 02:16:23.308
VERY VERY COMPLEX NETWORK OF

02:16:23.375 --> 02:16:24.643
COOPERATION.

02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:27.145
THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE -- IN

02:16:27.212 --> 02:16:28.580
OTHER AREAS AND SO.

02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:30.682
IF YOU END UP CREATING SOME

02:16:30.749 --> 02:16:32.817
STANDARDIZATION PROCESS THAT

02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:34.319
SQUASHES THAT INNOVATION.

02:16:34.386 --> 02:16:35.954
YOU'RE GONNA HURT MY COMMUNITIES

02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:37.389
AND THAT'S THAT WOULD BE THAT

02:16:37.455 --> 02:16:38.490
WOULD BE A SHAME BECAUSE THEY

02:16:38.557 --> 02:16:39.824
HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT WITH A

02:16:39.891 --> 02:16:42.227
LITTLE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:44.729
AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:48.600
THIS THIS CHANGE -- GROUP NEARLY

02:16:48.667 --> 02:16:50.035
TO THE DETRIMENT OF SOME OF THE

02:16:50.101 --> 02:16:51.937
PEOPLE THAT GET SERVICES IN MY

02:16:52.003 --> 02:16:54.406

FURTHER CLARIFY BECAUSE REALLY

02:17:01.613 --> 02:17:03.048
THE UNIQUENESS OF THE REGIONAL

02:17:03.114 --> 02:17:04.683

AWAY THAT FLEXIBILITY AND

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.950
UNIQUENESS BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:17:39.017 --> 02:17:40.018

SO THAT WE COULD DO IT QUICKLY

02:22:16.594 --> 02:22:17.629
AND ACCURATELY AND THAT'S

02:22:17.695 --> 02:22:19.030
CLIENTS MOVE THEM FROM COUNTY TO

02:22:19.097 --> 02:22:21.032
COUNTY AS MANY HAVE TO DO TO

02:22:21.099 --> 02:22:22.700

THAT WE ENHANCE OUR PREPAREDNESS

02:22:30.875 --> 02:22:32.076
BUT IT IT IT.

02:22:32.143 --> 02:22:33.912
BOGGLES THE MIND THAT THIS SMALL

02:22:33.978 --> 02:22:35.480
ONE TIME AMOUNT.

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:36.781

WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. TO

02:22:47.592 --> 02:22:49.861
RECONSIDER THAT PIECE.

02:22:49.928 --> 02:22:51.195
AND VERY SPECIFICALLY I WOULD

LARGELY COUNTIES RESPONDING TO

PAPER FORMS TO THAT -- MAKE MAKE

02:23:16.621 --> 02:23:19.223
ALL OF THAT HAPPENED -- AND AND

02:23:19.290 --> 02:23:22.060
THAT'S IT IN FACT THE CASE SO WE

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:24.162
DO THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW

02:23:24.228 --> 02:23:25.697
AUTOMATING SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:23:25.763 --> 02:23:26.998
AND MAKING IT AVAILABLE IS

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:28.466
CERTAINLY A PROCESS IMPROVEMENT

02:23:28.533 --> 02:23:29.934
IT SIMPLY WASN'T FUNDED AS A

02:23:30.001 --> 02:23:32.804
PRIORITY IN THE GOVERNOR'S MY

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:33.805

02:23:41.879 --> 02:23:44.983
AS GOOD AS IT IS.

02:23:45.049 --> 02:23:45.883
FROM THE FINANCE TERRORISTS FROM

02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:46.551
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK WE

02:23:46.617 --> 02:23:47.185
JUST POINT OUT THAT WE DO ON AN

02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:49.687
ANNUAL BASIS PROVIDE A ROUGHLY

02:23:49.754 --> 02:23:50.221
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:51.622
DOLLAR MAINTENANCE AND

02:23:51.689 --> 02:23:55.493

02:24:00.698 --> 02:24:01.532
CHANGES TO MAKE.

02:24:01.599 --> 02:24:02.934
ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES SUCH

02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:05.169
AS THESE AND WHEN THERE IS A

02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:07.372
STATE OR FEDERAL PROGRAM OR

02:24:07.438 --> 02:24:08.506
CHANGE.

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:10.174
THAT FORCES MORE WORK WHAT ON

02:24:10.241 --> 02:24:11.409
THE COUNTIES OR THE AUTOMATION

02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:13.378
SYSTEM WE TRADITIONALLY PAY FOR

02:24:13.444 --> 02:24:13.745
THAT.

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:15.246
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THIS COULD BE

02:24:15.313 --> 02:24:17.482
FUNDED WITHIN THE EXISTING A

02:24:17.548 --> 02:24:20.184
MINNOW RESOURCES.

02:24:20.251 --> 02:24:21.753

THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT COMPLETELY

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:24.822
ACCURATE WHAT IS TRUE.

02:24:24.889 --> 02:24:26.791
IS THAT THERE ABOUT EIGHT

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:28.092
THOUSAND HOURS -- THE BETTER PER

02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:30.528
YEAR FOR MAINTENANCE AND-OPERATIONS CHANGES THAT ARE

02:24:30.595 --> 02:24:32.530
PROVIDED TO SAUCE THAT NUMBER

02:24:32.597 --> 02:24:35.366
HASN'T CHANGED IN YEARS PROBABLY

02:24:35.433 --> 02:24:37.535
OVER A DECADE -- THAT

02:24:37.602 --> 02:24:39.037
MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:41.739
BUDGET HAS TO FIND NOT JUST

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:43.508
PROCESS CHANGES THAT THE COUNTY

IT ALSO IS USED. TO AUTOMATE

02:24:47.145 --> 02:24:49.247
POLICY CHANGES THAT THE STATE

02:24:49.313 --> 02:24:51.349
DOES NOT BELIEVE WARRANT

ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING SO IT'S

02:24:53.184 --> 02:24:54.519
NOT.

02:24:54.585 --> 02:24:57.088
IT IT'S NOT ACCURATE TO IMPLY

02:24:57.155 --> 02:24:58.689
THAT IT'S IF THE COUNTIES WANTED

02:24:58.756 --> 02:25:00.291
DUE PROCESS HE'S BETTER THEY

02:25:00.358 --> 02:25:02.393
HAVE THEIR OWN MONEY FOR IT.

02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.594
IT'S THE ERIC TO AUTOMATE

02:25:03.661 --> 02:25:05.129
IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU WANT AND

02:25:05.196 --> 02:25:06.798

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.166
RESOURCES THAT WE'VE GOTTEN HAVE

02:25:08.232 --> 02:25:10.201
NOT INCREASED WHILE THE NUMBER

02:25:10.268 --> 02:25:11.903
OF CHANGES THAT PEOPLE HAVE STOP

02:25:11.969 --> 02:25:13.938
WITH ADVOCATES AND POLICYMAKERS.

02:25:14.005 --> 02:25:15.540
HAS INCREASED CONSIDERABLY IF WE

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:17.041
HAD THE RESOURCES WITHIN THE

02:25:17.108 --> 02:25:17.875
MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS

02:25:17.942 --> 02:25:20.311
BUDGET WE WE WOULD HAVE FUNDED

02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:21.345
IT BUT I WOULD SAY THE ARGUES

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:22.013
IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.147
ARGUMENT.

02:25:23.214 --> 02:25:26.384
BECAUSE WE GIVE DSS A LOT OF

02:25:26.451 --> 02:25:28.686
MONEY RIGHT NOW -- TO DO THEIR

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:29.787
WORK.

02:25:29.854 --> 02:25:31.255
THE BUDGET DIDN'T SAY IF YOU

02:25:31.322 --> 02:25:32.990
LOOK IF IT'S A REALLY A PRIORITY

02:25:33.057 --> 02:25:34.225
FOR YOU TO DO ENHANCED.

02:25:34.292 --> 02:25:36.828
DISASTER RESPONSE YOU CAN DO IT

02:25:36.894 --> 02:25:38.529
WITHIN YOUR EXISTING BUDGET.

02:25:38.596 --> 02:25:40.064
THE BUDGET SAYS WE'RE NOT DOING

02:25:40.131 --> 02:25:42.100
ENOUGH AS A STATE AND THE

02:25:42.166 --> 02:25:44.802
REALITY OF MULTIPLE.

02:25:44.869 --> 02:25:45.803
BE.

02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:47.572
DISASTERS ARE HAPPENING ALL TOO

02:25:47.638 --> 02:25:49.474
FREQUENTLY ARE SUCH THAT WE NEED

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.775
TO STEP IT UP WE NEED TO ADD

02:25:50.842 --> 02:25:52.210
MORE RESOURCES.

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:54.011
SO WE'VE ADDED OVER A HALF A

02:25:54.078 --> 02:25:56.180
BILLION DOLLARS TO VARIOUS

02:25:56.247 --> 02:25:58.116
AGENCIES TO WHOM WE DIDNOT SAY

02:25:58.182 --> 02:26:00.017
IF THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR YOU

02:26:00.084 --> 02:26:01.385
YOU CAN USE YOUR EXISTING MONEY.

02:26:01.452 --> 02:26:03.387
BUT FOR NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:26:03.454 --> 02:26:04.722
DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE

02:26:04.789 --> 02:26:06.557
THE PROVISION OF FOOD TO PEOPLE

02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:08.659
WHO HAVE NOTHING THE ANSWER IS

02:26:08.726 --> 02:26:10.194
IF IF THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

02:26:10.261 --> 02:26:11.496
COUNTIES THAT CAN DO IT WITH

02:26:11.562 --> 02:26:13.698
THEIR MONEY SO -- I BRISTLE AT

02:26:13.764 --> 02:26:15.766
THE SUGGESTION THAT THAT WE HAVE

02:26:15.833 --> 02:26:17.201
THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES OR

02:26:17.268 --> 02:26:19.303
THAT IT IS NOT THE STATE'S

02:26:19.370 --> 02:26:21.105
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:26:21.172 --> 02:26:22.773
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK DEPARTMENT

02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:24.742
OF FINANCE.

02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:27.078
IS THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:26:27.145 --> 02:26:28.679
DOLLAR.

02:26:28.746 --> 02:26:31.082
PRICE TAG ON THIS IS THAT IS

02:26:31.149 --> 02:26:33.718
THAT ESTIMATES ACCURATE.

02:26:33.784 --> 02:26:34.785
WITH THAT TAKE CARE OF THIS

02:26:34.852 --> 02:26:37.622
ISSUE.

02:26:37.688 --> 02:26:38.956
I WOULD I WOULD NOTE THAT WE GET

02:26:39.023 --> 02:26:40.558
THOSE ESTIMATES FROM THE

02:26:40.625 --> 02:26:42.994
CONSORTIA SO IF THE CONSORTIUM

02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:44.962
TERMINATE THAT'S THE PRICE TAG.

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:47.098
WE WOULD MOST LIKELY AGREE WITH

02:26:47.165 --> 02:26:48.599
THAT.

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:51.202
AFTER LOOKING INTO IT.

02:26:51.269 --> 02:26:51.702
THIS IS A PICTURE OF A

02:26:51.769 --> 02:26:52.837
GOVERNMENT APARTMENT IF I CAN

02:26:52.904 --> 02:26:54.338
ADD TO THAT THAT WAS THE STATE

02:26:54.405 --> 02:26:55.673
GENERAL FUND PORTION AS WE

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.041
UNDERSTAND IT WE BELIEVE THE

02:26:57.108 --> 02:26:58.976
ENTIRE TOTAL PRICE TAG WAS ONE

02:26:59.043 --> 02:27:00.511
POINT EIGHT MILLION WITH THAT

02:27:00.578 --> 02:27:02.180
THE GENERAL FUND BEING MATCHED

02:27:02.246 --> 02:27:03.881
BY FEDERAL FUNDS.

02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:05.116
JUST FOR CLARITY [inaudible]

02:27:05.183 --> 02:27:06.817
THANK YOU.

02:27:06.884 --> 02:27:07.952
IF IF IT IS IN THAT YOU'RE

02:27:08.019 --> 02:27:09.420
USUALLY AFTER LOOKING AT IT SO

02:27:09.487 --> 02:27:12.056
IF YOU'RE ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK

02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:12.690
AT IT AGAIN IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE

02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:15.493
SAYING.

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:16.627
I WOULD NOTE THAT KURT CURRENTLY

02:27:16.694 --> 02:27:18.996
BASED ON THIS CONVERSATION WERE

02:27:19.063 --> 02:27:20.264
MAINTAIN THE POSITION THAT WE

02:27:20.331 --> 02:27:21.666
BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE

02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:23.201
PRIORITIZE WITHIN COUNTY

02:27:23.267 --> 02:27:25.703
RESOURCES FOR THE SAUCE SYSTEM.

02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:27.538
BUT SPECIFICALLY AS TO THE

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:28.739
ESTIMATE.

02:27:28.806 --> 02:27:32.677
IS THE ESTIMATE ACCURATE.

02:27:32.743 --> 02:27:33.678
WE COULD CERTAINLY LOOK INTO

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:34.845
THAT ALL RIGHT THERE WOULD YOU

02:27:34.912 --> 02:27:35.846

02:27:35.913 --> 02:27:37.949
STAFF.

DEFINITELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:27:41.352 --> 02:27:42.720
YES START BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS

02:27:42.787 --> 02:27:45.323
DID DID ANYBODY BOTHER TO ASK

02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:45.823
THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE

02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:47.325
ENCOUNTERED THESE DISASTERS

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:48.392
RECENTLY.

02:27:48.459 --> 02:27:49.227

02:27:49.293 --> 02:27:51.596
YEAH.

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:52.830
AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:27:52.897 --> 02:27:55.399
REASONS FOR THE FOR THE PROPOSAL --

02:27:55.466 --> 02:27:56.734
WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

02:27:56.801 --> 02:27:58.569
COUNTIES DURING DISASTERS AND

02:27:58.636 --> 02:28:01.072
AFTER DISASTERS -- IN FACT THAT

02:28:01.138 --> 02:28:02.940
THERE ARE MOST CRITICAL PARTNERS

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:05.776
ALL ACROSS FROM FOR ASSISTANCE --

02:28:05.843 --> 02:28:06.944

SUCCUMBS FROM COUNTY SO WE WORK

02:28:10.514 --> 02:28:12.083
VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH COUNTIES.

AND EACH AND EVERY TIME AS WE'VE

02:28:13.651 --> 02:28:14.885
BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS WE'VE

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:15.920
BEEN LEARNING MORE AND MORE

02:28:15.987 --> 02:28:18.456
LESSONS ABOUT HOW TO DO THINGS

02:28:18.522 --> 02:28:20.191
BETTER AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:28:20.258 --> 02:28:22.727
AHEAD OF TIME. TO ENSURE THAT

02:28:22.793 --> 02:28:23.761
WE'RE DOING THINGS BETTER FROM

02:28:23.828 --> 02:28:26.130
THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS THE RESULT

02:28:26.197 --> 02:28:29.233
OF OUR LATEST LEARNING -- AS WE

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.502

CATASTROPHICFIRES IN PARADISE --

02:28:38.943 --> 02:28:41.045
EACH TIME WE ARE LEARNING MORE

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:43.514
AND MORE AND EACH TIME THAT THE

02:28:43.581 --> 02:28:45.816
RESPONSES ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT --

02:28:45.883 --> 02:28:48.719

SHELTERS -- WE ALWAYS HAVE

02:28:57.895 --> 02:28:59.897

FREQUENTLY HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST

02:29:44.008 --> 02:29:46.444
BUT NOT ON THE SAME SCALE --

02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:47.778
TYPICALLY IN A IN A MAJOR

02:29:47.845 --> 02:29:49.447
DISASTER THERE'S A THERE ARE RED

02:29:49.513 --> 02:29:53.351

FOURTEEN MILLION THAT WAS

02:40:19.142 --> 02:40:21.511
INCLUDING THAT THAT WAS BASED ON

02:40:21.578 --> 02:40:22.980
LOOKING AT THE CURRENT CASE THE

SUCCESSES WITH REDUCING THAT

02:40:40.797 --> 02:40:42.199
POPULATION OR THAT CASE ALONE.

02:40:42.265 --> 02:40:42.766
THAT'S GOING TO HOW WE BASED

02:40:42.833 --> 02:40:43.767
WHAT SOME OF THE WORKLOAD WOULD

02:40:43.834 --> 02:40:44.901
BE BASED OFF OF THEN WE WENT TO

02:40:44.968 --> 02:40:46.870
GET TO THE ADMIN PORTION WE

02:40:46.937 --> 02:40:48.905

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:05.422
BILLION SHORTFALL WOULD BE BASED

02:41:05.489 --> 02:41:08.191
ON THIS -- BECAUSE AGAIN WE LOOK

02:41:29.846 --> 02:41:31.782
ISSUE THAT WE RAISED IN JANUARY

DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY THAT WE

02:58:39.041 --> 02:58:40.676
THAT'S EXACTLY THE POPULATION

02:58:40.743 --> 02:58:41.811
THAT HOME VISITING PROGRAMS

02:58:41.877 --> 02:58:42.912
BENEFIT.

02:58:42.978 --> 02:58:44.346
ON THE FISCAL SIDE I WOULD

02:58:44.413 --> 02:58:46.048
SIMPLY SAY THAT WE'RE NOT FAR

02:58:46.115 --> 02:58:47.550
ENOUGH AND IMPLEMENTATION WHERE

02:58:47.616 --> 02:58:49.518
I HAVE ACTUAL DATA ON TAKE UP

02:58:49.585 --> 02:58:52.121
RATES ARE BUDGET IS PURELY --

02:58:52.188 --> 02:58:53.222
AND A BUDGET BASED ON

02:58:53.289 --> 02:58:55.357
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE NUMBER OR

02:58:55.424 --> 02:58:57.026
PERCENTAGE OF ALL ALL FAMILIES

02:58:57.093 --> 02:58:58.627
THAT ARE POSSIBLY ELIGIBLE THAT

02:58:58.694 --> 02:59:00.529
WOULD AGREED TO PARTICIPATE THIS

02:59:00.596 --> 02:59:02.331
IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM NOT A

02:59:02.398 --> 02:59:04.533
MANDATORY PROGRAM -- IT'S OUR

02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:05.401
UNDERSTANDING THAT WOULDN'T

02:59:05.468 --> 02:59:06.569
CHANGE UNDER THE ADVOCATE

02:59:06.635 --> 02:59:08.771
PROPOSAL SO BUT GIVEN THAT IT'S

02:59:08.838 --> 02:59:10.139
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO HAVE A

02:59:10.206 --> 02:59:14.176
FISCAL COMMENT BUT WE COMPLETELY

02:59:14.243 --> 02:59:17.246
UNDERSTAND THE POLICY INTENT.

02:59:17.313 --> 02:59:19.715
WITH WITH REGARD TO THE LANGUAGE

02:59:19.782 --> 02:59:21.350
OF WOOD.

02:59:21.417 --> 02:59:22.017
IT'S CLEAR THAT THE LAW CAN ONLY

02:59:22.084 --> 02:59:24.820
BE INTO IMPLEMENTED TO THE

02:59:24.887 --> 02:59:26.989
DEGREE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDING --

02:59:27.056 --> 02:59:28.724
SO THE THE IT SEEMS THAT THE

02:59:28.791 --> 02:59:33.662
REQUEST OF THE ADVOCATES --

02:59:33.729 --> 02:59:35.297
MAKING A UNIVERSAL OFFER HOME

02:59:35.364 --> 02:59:39.869
VISITING -- WOULD BE MORE

02:59:39.935 --> 02:59:41.737
APPROPRIATE.

02:59:41.804 --> 02:59:43.472
WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE HERE.

02:59:43.539 --> 02:59:45.674
IS THERE A REASON WHY THE

02:59:45.741 --> 02:59:47.243
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

02:59:47.309 --> 02:59:49.678
SPECIFICALLY -- THAT THE

02:59:49.745 --> 02:59:53.182
ADVOCATES ARE REQUESTING -- IS

02:59:53.249 --> 02:59:54.650
THERE SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR

02:59:54.717 --> 02:59:56.886
THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

02:59:56.952 --> 03:00:00.856
ISN'T IS NOT AGREEMENT WITH.

03:00:00.923 --> 03:00:03.259
NO I I CONFESS IT'S BEEN A FEW --

03:00:03.325 --> 03:00:04.727
HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

03:00:04.793 --> 03:00:06.028
SINCE I PERSONALLY READ THAT

03:00:06.095 --> 03:00:08.697
LANGUAGE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS.

03:00:08.764 --> 03:00:09.298
YOU KNOW WHEN WE BUILT THIS

03:00:09.365 --> 03:00:11.100
PROGRAM AND WE ENACTED A STATUTE

03:00:11.167 --> 03:00:13.135
WE DELIVER LEASES SAID WE WANTED

03:00:13.202 --> 03:00:14.603
TO PRIORITIZE HELP FOR FIRST

03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:17.706
TIME PARENTS WITH YOUNGER KIDS.

03:00:17.773 --> 03:00:19.241
AND NOW WITH THIS THAT LANGUAGE

03:00:19.308 --> 03:00:20.176
WOULD GO BEYOND THAT

03:00:20.242 --> 03:00:22.578
PRIORITIZATION TO FIND ANY CHILD

03:00:22.645 --> 03:00:24.580
WHETHER IT'S YOUR SECOND THIRD

03:00:24.647 --> 03:00:26.182
OR FOURTH CHILD.

03:00:26.248 --> 03:00:28.217
IN THAT AGE RANGE -- YOU KNOW

03:00:28.284 --> 03:00:29.919
THAT OBVIOUSLY MAKES SENSE BUT

03:00:29.985 --> 03:00:31.220
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

03:00:31.287 --> 03:00:32.755
FURTHERANCE A OF THE POLICY

03:00:32.821 --> 03:00:34.323
PRIORITY WE SET FORTH WHEN THAT

03:00:34.390 --> 03:00:36.792
WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY

03:00:36.859 --> 03:00:38.661
IMPLEMENTED.

03:00:38.727 --> 03:00:40.829
I WOULD ELSE THAT -- THAT THE

03:00:40.896 --> 03:00:43.165
ADMINISTRATION TAKE A FRESH LOOK

03:00:43.232 --> 03:00:45.134
AT THE LANGUAGE.

03:00:45.201 --> 03:00:47.203
BECAUSE THERE IS.

03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:48.837
THERE IS GREAT INTEREST IN

03:00:48.904 --> 03:00:53.108
IMPLEMENTING THAT LANGUAGE.

03:00:53.175 --> 03:00:54.710
INTERNET WE CAN COMMIT TO THAT

03:00:54.777 --> 03:00:56.445
THANK YOU.

03:00:56.512 --> 03:00:57.913
COMMENTS FROM LA -- SPECIFICALLY

03:00:57.980 --> 03:00:59.348
ON THAT ISSUE.

03:00:59.415 --> 03:01:01.750
YES THANK YOU -- ONE OF THE

03:01:01.817 --> 03:01:03.352
POINTS WE BROUGHT UP LAST YEAR

03:01:03.419 --> 03:01:05.120
IN IN JANUARY WHEN THE HOME

03:01:05.187 --> 03:01:06.355
VISITING INITIATIVE WAS

03:01:06.422 --> 03:01:08.958
INITIALLY PROPOSED WAS THAT IT'S

03:01:09.024 --> 03:01:11.260
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. TO TO

03:01:11.327 --> 03:01:12.494
GET A FEEL FOR THE THE BUDGET

03:01:12.561 --> 03:01:14.964
REQUIREMENTS IT'S A NEW PROGRAM --

03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:17.967
THAT THE STATE WAS OPERATING AND

03:01:18.033 --> 03:01:19.335
EVEN A YEAR.

03:01:19.401 --> 03:01:20.836
IN THE FUTURE NOW WHERE WE ARE

03:01:20.903 --> 03:01:22.404
TODAY WE STILL KNOW VERY LITTLE

03:01:22.471 --> 03:01:23.939
ABOUT HOW IMPLEMENTATION IS

03:01:24.006 --> 03:01:25.841
GOING -- THE FOR THE VERY FIRST

03:01:25.908 --> 03:01:28.077
COUNTIES HAVE JUST NOW -- GOTTEN

03:01:28.143 --> 03:01:29.445
THE FIRST HOME VISITING SERVICES

03:01:29.511 --> 03:01:31.013
UP AND GOING IN THE HOME

03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:32.514
VISITING INITIATIVE IT'LL BE

03:01:32.581 --> 03:01:34.617
SOME TIME TO ECHO -- PREVIOUS

03:01:34.683 --> 03:01:37.086
COMMENTS BEFORE REBEL TO TO FINE

03:01:37.152 --> 03:01:39.221
TUNE THE BUDGET METHODOLOGY --

03:01:39.288 --> 03:01:41.123
OUR COMMENTS REGARDING THE THE

03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:42.858
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WHETHER

03:01:42.925 --> 03:01:45.694
UNIVERSAL OR MORE NARROW -- AS

03:01:45.761 --> 03:01:47.429
THE MINISTRATION IS NOTED THE

03:01:47.496 --> 03:01:49.131
PROGRAM AS IT IS IS NOT AN

03:01:49.198 --> 03:01:51.000
ENTITLEMENT -- A COUNTIES ARE

03:01:51.066 --> 03:01:52.968
ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES BASED

03:01:53.035 --> 03:01:54.803
ON THE FUNDING ALLOCATION THAT

03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:57.172
THEY RECEIVE.

03:01:57.239 --> 03:01:57.806
AND SO THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY

03:01:57.873 --> 03:01:59.341
OF THE STATE DECIDED TO MAKE A

03:01:59.408 --> 03:02:00.943
MORE UNIVERSAL OFFER.

03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:02.444
THE FISCAL CONSTRAINT WOULD

03:02:02.511 --> 03:02:04.113
STILL BE IN PLACE -- COUNTY'S

03:02:04.179 --> 03:02:06.148
ONLY BE ABLE TO OFFER SERVICES

03:02:06.215 --> 03:02:07.983
TO THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES OUT

03:02:08.050 --> 03:02:10.586
FOR WHICH THEY HAD -- RESOURCES

03:02:10.653 --> 03:02:12.655
AVAILABLE -- SWEDISH SUCH POINT

03:02:12.721 --> 03:02:17.026
OUT THAT THAT SLIGHT DISTINCTION.

03:02:17.092 --> 03:02:19.094
I THINK I ONCE HEARD HEARD IT

03:02:19.161 --> 03:02:20.763
SAID THAT TO VISION IS WHAT

03:02:20.829 --> 03:02:23.399
DRIVES IMPLEMENTATION SO WE DO

03:02:23.465 --> 03:02:25.768
KNOW THAT THE THE THE GOVERNOR

03:02:25.834 --> 03:02:27.202
HAS TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:29.171
OF OF TAKING CARE THE VERY

03:02:29.238 --> 03:02:31.273
YOUNGEST -- THAT HAS BEEN HIS

03:02:31.340 --> 03:02:33.242
VISION WE WERE WE'RE HEARING

03:02:33.309 --> 03:02:34.877
THIS.

03:02:34.943 --> 03:02:37.346
DARE I SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME --

03:02:37.413 --> 03:02:39.048
AND IT'S WE LOVE HEARING IT I

03:02:39.114 --> 03:02:40.916
THINK THAT IF IF THIS IS A

03:02:40.983 --> 03:02:44.019
COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE -- THEN

03:02:44.086 --> 03:02:45.554
LOOKING AT THAT LANGUAGE AND

03:02:45.621 --> 03:02:46.722
MAKING SURE THAT IT IS MORE

03:02:46.789 --> 03:02:49.091
INCLUSIVE I THINK WOULD SERVICE

03:02:49.158 --> 03:02:53.195
ALL BETTER.

03:02:53.262 --> 03:02:56.999
OKAY LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ITEM.

03:02:57.066 --> 03:02:58.167
YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THAT A

03:02:58.233 --> 03:02:59.468
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TOWN OF

03:02:59.535 --> 03:03:01.437
FUNDING GOES TO FIND CAL GRANTS

03:03:01.503 --> 03:03:03.405
AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION

03:03:03.472 --> 03:03:05.374
THIS IS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT.

03:03:05.441 --> 03:03:06.375
IS KIND OF WHAT WE CALL OUR

03:03:06.442 --> 03:03:07.976
BALANCE OR IN THE TOWN OF BUDGET

03:03:08.043 --> 03:03:09.845
AND SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS

03:03:09.912 --> 03:03:11.880
OF THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION THERE

03:03:11.947 --> 03:03:13.515
SO THAT THAT'S A SMALL AND

03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:15.451
RELATIVELY SMALL ADJUSTMENT --

03:03:15.517 --> 03:03:18.721
IN THAT FUNDING IS A C. RIGHT

03:03:18.787 --> 03:03:20.723
SIZING.

03:03:20.789 --> 03:03:21.690
OF FEDERAL MONEY. FOR FEDERAL

03:03:21.757 --> 03:03:23.392
FUNDS OKAY.

03:03:23.459 --> 03:03:24.993
LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ITEM OKAY

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:27.563
BUT THE NEXT -- ONE YOU MAY

03:03:27.629 --> 03:03:29.431
RECALL IN THE IN THE RESPONSE TO

03:03:29.498 --> 03:03:30.666
THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

COUNTIES RAISED CONCERNS WITH

03:03:32.634 --> 03:03:35.170
THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF SUN FOR

A FUNDING AVAILABLE.

03:03:36.672 --> 03:03:37.673
FOR COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE

03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:39.074
ACTIVITIES TO SUCCESSFULLY

03:03:39.141 --> 03:03:41.944
IMPLEMENT WE CALLED IT THEN ****

POPULATIONS -- MORE

03:03:47.416 --> 03:03:48.884
APPROPRIATELY DESCRIPTIVE O

03:03:48.951 --> 03:03:51.653
WHAT IT IS -- IN CONVERSATIONS

03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:52.955
WITH COUNTIES WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE

03:03:53.021 --> 03:03:54.556
CONCERN THERE THE MAY REVISION

03:03:54.623 --> 03:03:57.559
INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO

03:03:57.626 --> 03:03:59.228
POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS -- IN

03:03:59.294 --> 03:04:05.567
pTO BE AVAILABLE FOR TWO COUNTIES --

03:04:05.634 --> 03:04:06.835
SINCE THE MAYOR REVISIONIST COME

03:04:06.902 --> 03:04:08.070
OUT AND I'VE SEEN THE LANGUAGE

03:04:08.137 --> 03:04:10.038
PRINTED AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE

03:04:10.105 --> 03:04:10.873
THIRTEEN IN YOUR AGENDA COUNTIES

03:04:10.939 --> 03:04:12.408
OF RAISE CONCERNS SO THAT MIGHT

03:04:12.474 --> 03:04:13.142
BE.

03:04:13.208 --> 03:04:14.777
A PROPOSED ADMINISTRATIVE

03:04:14.843 --> 03:04:16.879
PROCESS THAT'S TOO COMPLEX AND

03:04:16.945 --> 03:04:18.514
NOT TIMELY ENOUGH FOR SUCCESS --

03:04:18.580 --> 03:04:20.649
THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT AND SO

03:04:20.716 --> 03:04:22.384
THAT THAT CONVERSATION CAN

03:04:22.451 --> 03:04:23.952
CONTINUE WITH COUNTIES.

03:04:24.019 --> 03:04:25.654
IN TERMS OF HOW WE MAKE THAT

03:04:25.721 --> 03:04:32.728
FUNDING AVAILABLE TO THEM -- AND

03:04:32.795 --> 03:04:33.529
WHEN COUNTIES CAME WITH THE

03:04:33.595 --> 03:04:34.229
CONCERN ABOUT THE LEVEL OF

03:04:34.296 --> 03:04:35.964
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING IT CAME

03:04:36.031 --> 03:04:38.534
WITH CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE

03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:40.602
AMOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS IT

03:04:40.669 --> 03:04:42.604
WOULD TAKE TO HANDLE CASES THE

03:04:42.671 --> 03:04:45.207
COST PER HOUR -- AND THOSE THOSE

03:04:45.274 --> 03:04:47.943
KINDS OF OF THINGS AS WELL --

03:04:48.010 --> 03:04:49.611
AND WE'VE -- MADE A VERBAL

03:04:49.678 --> 03:04:50.979
COMMITMENT TO COUNTY IS THAT IN

03:04:51.046 --> 03:04:52.948
THE COMING FALL WE WOULD TO TAKE

03:04:53.015 --> 03:04:55.417
A FRESH LOOK AT HOW WE THERE

03:04:55.484 --> 03:04:57.386
WOULD BE MAYBE THE NEXT PROGRAM

03:04:57.453 --> 03:05:00.456
WE WE MODERNIZE THE METHODOLOGY

03:05:00.522 --> 03:05:02.391
FOR ADMINISTRATION BUDGETING ON

03:05:02.458 --> 03:05:04.193
BUT NOT WITHSTANDING THAT WE

03:05:04.259 --> 03:05:06.361
WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THESE.

03:05:06.428 --> 03:05:08.063
FORTY ALMOST FORTY THREE MILLION

03:05:08.130 --> 03:05:09.898
AND RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE --

03:05:09.965 --> 03:05:12.201
THIS EARLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR

03:05:12.267 --> 03:05:14.102
FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF

03:05:14.169 --> 03:05:15.671
THIS IMPORTANT POLICY CHANGE WE

03:05:15.737 --> 03:05:16.572
DIDN'T WANT.

03:05:16.638 --> 03:05:18.540
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RATES AND

03:05:18.607 --> 03:05:20.142
HOURS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO TO

03:05:20.209 --> 03:05:21.610
GET IN THE WAY OF GETTING PEOPLE

03:05:21.677 --> 03:05:24.413
THROUGH THE DOOR AND PROCESSED

03:05:24.480 --> 03:05:26.181
ACCURATELY.

03:05:26.248 --> 03:05:27.282
I THINK I THINK THE WHAT WE HAVE

03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:28.984
HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE

03:05:29.051 --> 03:05:30.652
COUNTIES.

03:05:30.719 --> 03:05:32.020
THERE'S A GREAT OBJECTION TO THE

03:05:32.087 --> 03:05:33.622
DOLLAR AMOUNT IT'S THAT SPECIFIC

03:05:33.689 --> 03:05:35.824
LANGUAGE.

03:05:35.891 --> 03:05:37.993
MAKING IT ALMOST CONTINGENT --

03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:39.628
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE IS AN

03:05:39.695 --> 03:05:41.129
INCREASED WORKLOAD WE ALREADY

03:05:41.196 --> 03:05:42.598
KNOW THE WORK HAS TO BE DONE.

03:05:42.664 --> 03:05:44.466
THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

CANNOT FIND A WORKER.

03:23:17.318 --> 03:23:19.854

TO BECAUSE THE RATE IS LESS.

03:23:44.812 --> 03:23:45.613
WHAT THAT DOES IS LEAVE THE

03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:47.648
PROVIDER WITH ONE TO THREE

03:23:47.715 --> 03:23:48.849

THE SINGLE ALLOCATION THAT

FLEXIBILITY HAS BEEN PART OF THE

03:29:05.699 --> 03:29:09.336
PROGRAM FOR TWENTY YEARS.

03:29:09.403 --> 03:29:10.671

TO PHASE THAT IN SO AND BUDGET

03:29:25.352 --> 03:29:27.288

03:30:00.321 --> 03:30:01.488
COUNTIES HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN

03:30:01.555 --> 03:30:03.557

ANTICIPATING THAT.

03:30:57.077 --> 03:30:58.946
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE

TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IT -- IT

APPROPRIATELY IS BECAUSE WE DID

03:31:56.837 --> 03:31:58.572
HAVE THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION

03:31:58.639 --> 03:32:00.541
DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED AND

03:38:48.448 --> 03:38:50.150
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE

03:38:50.217 --> 03:38:51.818
SENSE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. TO

03:38:51.885 --> 03:38:55.455
HAVE A RESTORATION OF A CUT THAT

03:38:55.522 --> 03:38:55.989
WAS MADE DURING THE GREAT

03:38:56.056 --> 03:38:57.958
RECESSION -- TO A POPULATION IS

03:38:58.024 --> 03:38:59.926
VERY VULNERABLE.

03:38:59.993 --> 03:39:02.062
BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A DOWNTURN

03:39:02.128 --> 03:39:03.396
IN REVENUES TWO YEARS FROM NOW

03:39:03.463 --> 03:39:05.365
WE THINK.

03:39:05.432 --> 03:39:08.468
THAT CUTS SHOULD BE HARD TO MAKE.

03:39:08.535 --> 03:39:09.603
AND THAT THE STATE IN THE

03:39:09.669 --> 03:39:11.605
LEGISLATURE DID MINISTRATION

03:39:11.671 --> 03:39:13.206
SHOULDGO TO A PROCESS TO

03:39:13.273 --> 03:39:14.641
CAREFULLY CONSIDER.

03:39:14.708 --> 03:39:19.045
A REDUCTION IF IT'S NECESSARY --

03:39:19.112 --> 03:39:20.046
ONE OF THE THINGS IS REALLY

03:39:20.113 --> 03:39:21.414
DIFFICULT WITH THIS IS THAT THE

03:39:21.481 --> 03:39:23.416
CUT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE EFFECT

03:39:23.483 --> 03:39:26.786
JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO

03:39:26.853 --> 03:39:28.989
THAT WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE

03:39:29.055 --> 03:39:30.524
FOR ADVOCATES FOR FAMILIES. TO

03:39:30.590 --> 03:39:33.093
REALLY FIGHT THE REDUCTIONS ALL

03:39:33.159 --> 03:39:35.228
WE WOULD BE DOING IS FOR THE

03:39:35.295 --> 03:39:37.364
NEXT PREVIOUS YEAR IS TO BE

03:39:37.430 --> 03:39:38.965
WORRIED THAT WOULD THIS CUT

03:39:39.032 --> 03:39:40.567
HAPPEN OR NOT.

03:39:40.634 --> 03:39:42.335
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR I THINK WE

03:39:42.402 --> 03:39:44.604
CAN DO THE RIGHT THING NOT HAVE

03:39:44.671 --> 03:39:47.440
OF THIS -- YOU KNOW HAD THE

03:39:47.507 --> 03:39:49.376
RESTORATION PERMANENT AS AS THIS

03:39:49.442 --> 03:39:50.777

03:39:50.844 --> 03:39:53.146

NO.

03:40:00.053 --> 03:40:02.055

ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES ARE

03:40:29.215 --> 03:40:31.051
DIFFERENT AND THAT'S THE ROLE OF

03:40:31.117 --> 03:40:32.619

GIVER FUNDING FOR UP TO A

03:41:35.448 --> 03:41:36.182
HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS BUT WE

03:41:36.249 --> 03:41:37.884

RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL IS

03:41:49.262 --> 03:41:50.563
STILL TAKING ON AVERAGE A

03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:52.032
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AND SO

03:41:52.098 --> 03:41:53.433
THAT MEANS MANY MORE FAMILIES

03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:55.402
ARE TAKING MORE THAN A HUNDRED

03:41:55.468 --> 03:41:56.803

FINDING BY THE DEPARTMENT THAT

03:42:02.542 --> 03:42:04.044
THE DELAY IS NEITHER THE CARE

03:42:04.110 --> 03:42:06.212
GIVER OR THE COUNTY'S FAULT.

03:42:06.279 --> 03:42:08.848

THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS --

03:42:15.255 --> 03:42:16.990
SEEMS PATENTLY UNFAIR WE DON'T

03:42:17.057 --> 03:42:18.458
THINK THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY

03:42:18.525 --> 03:42:19.059
SHOULD BE THE ONES THAT ARE

03:42:19.125 --> 03:42:22.429

04:09:21.946 --> 04:09:24.249

THE FIRST ITEM THE THE CHANGES

04:09:26.785 --> 04:09:28.987
TO SB -- SEVEN TWENTY SIX WE

04:09:29.054 --> 04:09:30.555
THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE ARE

04:09:30.622 --> 04:09:33.758
FINE WITH THAT -- I JUST OF I'M

04:09:33.825 --> 04:09:35.160
GOING TO TAKE BACK MY EARLIER

04:09:35.226 --> 04:09:36.661
REMARKS ABOUT THE SS I CASH OUT

04:09:36.728 --> 04:09:38.196
CLEAN UP LANGUAGE -- IN READING

04:09:38.263 --> 04:09:39.130
THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IT'S

04:09:39.197 --> 04:09:40.332
POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT

04:09:40.398 --> 04:09:41.800
FINANCES WEBSITE.

04:09:41.866 --> 04:09:44.269
I DON'T THINK IT DOES EITHER

04:09:44.336 --> 04:09:47.605
THING I DON'T THINK IT.

04:09:47.672 --> 04:09:48.873
FOR IT DOESN'T PROVIDE FOR AN

04:09:48.940 --> 04:09:49.774
ENTITLEMENT TO AID AND IT'S NOT

04:09:49.841 --> 04:09:52.811
CLEAR TO ME THAT IT -- DOESN'T

04:09:52.877 --> 04:09:54.779
CONTINUE TO SUBJECT THE PROGRAM

04:09:54.846 --> 04:09:56.915
TO AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION SO I

04:09:56.981 --> 04:09:57.816
THINK WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO

04:09:57.882 --> 04:09:58.783
REVIEW THAT WHEN WE CAN BE IN

04:09:58.850 --> 04:09:59.884
TOUCH WITH THE COMMITTEE ABOUT

04:09:59.951 --> 04:10:01.619
WHETHER OR NOT WE THINK THAT

04:10:01.686 --> 04:10:03.254
LANGUAGE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHES --

04:10:03.321 --> 04:10:05.423
THE PURPOSES AND I WOULD ALSO

04:10:05.490 --> 04:10:07.492
NOTE THAT I WAS ABLE TO REVIEW

04:10:07.559 --> 04:10:09.127
QUICKLY THE HOUSING DISABILITY

04:10:09.194 --> 04:10:12.630
ADVOCACY PROGRAM LANGUAGE --

04:10:12.697 --> 04:10:13.665
THIS SEEMS TO BE A RATHER

04:10:13.732 --> 04:10:16.167
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM WHAT THE

04:10:16.234 --> 04:10:18.536
LEGISLATURE AGREED -- TO SOME

04:10:18.603 --> 04:10:19.571
TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO I MEAN

04:10:19.637 --> 04:10:20.972
AGAIN I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO

04:10:21.039 --> 04:10:23.341
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TALK WITH

04:10:23.408 --> 04:10:24.209
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

04:10:24.275 --> 04:10:24.776
COMMITTEE.

04:10:24.843 --> 04:10:25.910
AND MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE

04:10:25.977 --> 04:10:27.379
DOING THERE IS IS STILL

04:10:27.445 --> 04:10:28.713
CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL

04:10:28.780 --> 04:10:30.915
INTO THE PROGRAM.

04:10:30.982 --> 04:10:31.883
THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible]

04:10:31.950 --> 04:10:34.386
THANK YOU.

04:10:34.452 --> 04:10:34.986
GOOD EVENING THE START BECAUSE

04:10:35.053 --> 04:10:35.653
WITH THE COOPER GROUP ON BEHALF

04:10:35.720 --> 04:10:37.856
OF CATHOLIC CHARITIES IN SUPPORT

04:10:37.922 --> 04:10:39.591
OF ITEMS NUMBER EIGHT AND NINE

04:10:39.657 --> 04:10:42.160
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK

04:10:42.227 --> 04:10:46.798
ESPECIALLY TO DSS THE VERY GOOD.

04:10:46.865 --> 04:10:48.099
IF I MAY CHAIRED JUST MAYBE MY

04:10:48.166 --> 04:10:49.734
MISSED OPPORTUNITY AS WELL IF IF

04:10:49.801 --> 04:10:51.136
I COULD GIVEN THE INTEREST IN

04:10:51.202 --> 04:10:52.570
THE AUTOMATION OF THE DISASTER

04:10:52.637 --> 04:10:53.671
CALIBRATION ISSUE THAT MISTER

04:10:53.738 --> 04:10:57.342
MAC I MENTIONED THE NINE HUNDRED

04:10:57.409 --> 04:10:57.942
THOUSAND WITH MATCHING FEDERAL

04:10:58.009 --> 04:10:59.744
FUNDS -- I I WOULD ALSO JUST

04:10:59.811 --> 04:11:01.479
POINT OUT ACROSS THE BOARD ON

04:11:01.546 --> 04:11:04.082
LEGISLATION AND BUDGET ITEMS --

04:11:04.149 --> 04:11:05.950
BECAUSE OF THE MIGRATION OF THE

04:11:06.017 --> 04:11:08.987
SYSTEMS FROM THREE TO TWO THREE

04:11:09.053 --> 04:11:09.821
THREE SYSTEMS TO ONE SYSTEM.

04:11:09.888 --> 04:11:12.223
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

04:11:12.290 --> 04:11:14.526
THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXISTING

04:11:14.592 --> 04:11:16.594
BUDGET EVEN FOR CHANGES TO BE

04:11:16.661 --> 04:11:17.395
MADE.

04:11:17.462 --> 04:11:18.630
AND SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

04:11:18.696 --> 04:11:20.165
AREAS AS YOU SAW WITH OUR OWN

04:11:20.231 --> 04:11:22.000
PROPOSAL AROUND OVER PAYMENT

04:11:22.066 --> 04:11:23.368
COLLECTIONS WE'RE WE'RE

04:11:23.435 --> 04:11:24.936
SUGGESTING THAT DATES BE PUSHED

04:11:25.003 --> 04:11:25.703
OUT.

04:11:25.770 --> 04:11:27.105
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT

04:11:27.172 --> 04:11:28.807
HAPPENED FOR DISASTER CAL FOR

04:11:28.873 --> 04:11:31.075
ASH BUT I WOULD SIMPLY SUGGEST

04:11:31.142 --> 04:11:32.076
THAT.

04:11:32.143 --> 04:11:32.944
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

04:11:33.011 --> 04:11:34.946
CONVERSATION AROUND ANY ITEM

04:11:35.013 --> 04:11:36.047
THAT IMPACTS SAWS AND

04:11:36.114 --> 04:11:39.150
POTENTIALLY REQUIRES AUTOMATION --

04:11:39.217 --> 04:11:41.553
THAT EITHER THERE'D BE A

04:11:41.619 --> 04:11:45.356
PRIORITY EVEN -- CLEARLY STATED.

04:11:45.423 --> 04:11:47.525
FOR IT IT HE ITS INCLUSION IN A

04:11:47.592 --> 04:11:48.960
PARTICULAR YEAR TO THE EXTENT

04:11:49.027 --> 04:11:50.662
THAT'S POSSIBLE AND I WOULD NEED

04:11:50.728 --> 04:11:51.196
A BEER.

04:11:51.262 --> 04:11:52.697
OF COURSE INCLUSIVE OF

04:11:52.764 --> 04:11:54.399
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY --

04:11:54.466 --> 04:11:56.067
CONSORTIA THAT OPERATE THOSE

04:11:56.134 --> 04:11:57.368
SYSTEMS.

04:11:57.435 --> 04:11:59.137
EITHER TO AUTOMATED OR TO

04:11:59.204 --> 04:12:01.139
CONSIDER THAT THE COST OF THE

04:12:01.206 --> 04:12:03.174
WORKER TIME TO DO MANUAL WORK

04:12:03.241 --> 04:12:04.909
AROUNDS FOR THOSE THINGS OR

04:12:04.976 --> 04:12:05.844
WHETHER IT DELAYED

04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:07.745
IMPLEMENTATION DATE IS A MORE

04:12:07.812 --> 04:12:09.280
FEASIBLE APPROACH.

04:12:09.347 --> 04:12:10.982
SO IS A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED

04:12:11.049 --> 04:12:12.617
THE OTHER OPTION IS TO ALLOCATE

04:12:12.684 --> 04:12:14.452
FUNDING FOR A PURPOSE.

04:12:14.519 --> 04:12:16.421
AND ASK FOR IT TO BE DONE WHEN

04:12:16.488 --> 04:12:19.090
IT'S FEASIBLE TO DO SO AT ANY IN

04:12:19.157 --> 04:12:20.225
THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS

04:12:20.291 --> 04:12:21.793
MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR A MULTI

04:12:21.860 --> 04:12:22.961
YEAR PERIOD.

04:12:23.027 --> 04:12:25.029
SO IN IN THE INTERESTS OF OF

04:12:25.096 --> 04:12:26.831
BEING ASSISTIVE -- I DON'T WANT

04:12:26.898 --> 04:12:29.234
ANYBODY TO BE CONFUSED BY

04:12:29.300 --> 04:12:31.236
REMARKS AROUND SAWS SOME THINGS

04:12:31.302 --> 04:12:32.937
LIKE GRANT INCREASES ARE JUST

04:12:33.004 --> 04:12:34.372
REPLACING NUMBERS AND TABLES ON

04:12:34.439 --> 04:12:35.740
THOSE DON'T REALLY REQUIRE

04:12:35.807 --> 04:12:37.709
CHANGES -- BUT OTHER THINGS ARE

04:12:37.775 --> 04:12:40.245
MORE COMPLEX -- AND MAY REQUIRE

04:12:40.311 --> 04:12:41.779
SOME TIME SO I'M JUST LAYING OUT

04:12:41.846 --> 04:12:43.414
SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE

04:12:43.481 --> 04:12:44.883
COMMITTEE.

04:12:44.949 --> 04:12:46.251
ADDITIONALLY.

04:12:46.317 --> 04:12:48.186
THERE'S AS YOU KNOW A VERY LARGE

04:12:48.253 --> 04:12:49.053
VOLUME.

04:12:49.120 --> 04:12:50.588
OF ITEMS BOTH FROM THE

04:12:50.655 --> 04:12:52.790
ADMINISTRATION AND FROM OTHERS

04:12:52.857 --> 04:12:54.492
ASKING FOR CONSIDERATION IN THE

04:12:54.559 --> 04:12:56.294
BUDGET PROCESS AND WE SIMPLY

04:12:56.361 --> 04:12:57.862
WANT TO PLACE HOLD THAT IT TAKES

04:12:57.929 --> 04:12:59.063
PEOPLE TO GET SOME OF THOSE

04:12:59.130 --> 04:13:00.331
THINGS DONE.

04:13:00.398 --> 04:13:01.366
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE COME

04:13:01.432 --> 04:13:02.700
TO AN AGREEMENT AROUND THE FINAL

04:13:02.767 --> 04:13:04.402
PACKAGE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD

04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:05.603
BE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING A

04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:07.105
CONVERSATION.
