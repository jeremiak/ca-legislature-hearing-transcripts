APPROACHES TO THIS. IN ADDITION

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.620

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:56.221
NARROW IN ITS APPLICATION WITH

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.691

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.823
ISSUES FROM THE OPPOSITION BEING

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.859
ADDRESSED IS OUR WAY TO. I THINK

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:43.128
THAT'S RIGHT- SINCE INTRODUCTION

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:44.396
THE BILL WE HAVE BECOME AWARE

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:46.365
THAT IS MORE CHALLENGING ON

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:49.435
CERTAIN MODELS- TO ETCH. THE

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:51.336
CATALYTIC CONVERTER YOU HAVE TO

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:54.706
DISASSEMBLE AND REASSEMBLE AND I

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:55.908
THINK THE OPPONENTS ARE

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:57.176
CORRECTED SOMETIMES TAKES HOURS

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.811
THE BILL CORRECT IN THAT-

00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:00.913
THIEVES. MOST LIKELY AREN'T

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:02.781
GOING TO ATTACK A VEHICLE THAT

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:04.917
REQUIRES YOU KNOW SEVERAL

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.051
MINUTES OF NON OUR TO

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.486
DISASSEMBLE AND SOLD US IN

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:09.421
APPROPRIATIONS ORGAN AMEND THE

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:12.591
BILL TO AMEND OUT. OF THOSE.

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:16.428
THOSE MODELS. THAT DO NOT ALLOW

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:17.896
FOR READY ACCESS THE CATALYTIC

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.531
CONVERTER CORE SETS DEPEND UPON

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.733
THE CHEER OF APPROPRIATIONS AND

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.669
WHETHER HE OR NOT HE GREASE THAT

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:27.406
ARE NOT. FEATURE TO- EVEN THOUGH

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:30.209
I IS A CO AUTHOR JOIN- THE

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:36.381
SECOND IS THIS JUST FOR. DEALERS

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:38.717
OR DOES IT ALSO WOULD ALSO

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.520
INCLUDE- CAPTURE INDIVIDUAL

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:44.456
SELLERS JUST DEALERS OKAY AND

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:51.096
THEN- THE THIRD QUESTION WAS. SO

00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:55.701
CURRENTLY FOR EXAMPLE- NGUYEN

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:59.505
DEALERS ARE SELLING- AS A YOU

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:02.841
KNOW A VEHICLE THAT'S BEEN IN M.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.743
ACCIDENT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.980
HAVE A- THE TITLE THAT SAYS IT

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.282
SALVAGED AND SO IT'S UP TO THE

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:12.117
BUYER TO MAKE THEIR OWN

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:13.652
DETERMINATION ABOUT IF THEY WANT

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:15.621
TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE- IS

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:16.788
THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT MAYBE

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:19.491
HAVING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:22.027
FOR THIS- BECAUSE- I MEAN AT THE

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:23.729
END OF THE DAY. I GUESS THE

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.764
QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE OUTCOME

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.032
THAT YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.867
PURCHASE CARS THAT HAVE A STOLEN

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:31.336
CATALYTIC CONVERTER OR YOU DON'T

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:34.339
WANT. IT SO BECAUSE IT SEEMS

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:36.108
LIKE IT'S HITTING THE PERSON IN

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:38.243
THE MIDDLE WHO MAY BE KNOWINGLY

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.178
OR UNKNOWINGLY RIGHT SELLING A

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:43.315
VEHICLE THAT HAS A STOLEN. WHAT

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:45.984
IS THE- SO FAR AS I KNOW THE

00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:47.452
STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS ARE

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.288
ARE NOT PLACED ON OTHER VEHICLES

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.557
THEIR THEIR OWN FOR PURPOSES OF

00:19:51.623 --> 00:19:54.293
PRECIOUS METALS AND SO I THINK

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.061
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT SOMEONE WOULD

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:58.931
PURCHASE A VEHICLE THAT HAS A OF

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.365
PREVIOUSLY STOLEN CATALYTIC

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:02.834
CONVERTER WHICH WAS A FIX TO

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:05.103
THAT VEHICLE. OKAY AND THEN THE

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.206
LAST QUESTION IS- IT DOES SAY IN

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:10.275
HERE THAT THE BILL WOULD INSTEAD

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:11.577
I. WOULD INSTEAD OF PAYMENT BY

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:12.678
CHECK REQUIRE PAYMENT BY ANY

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:15.314
TRACEABLE MATH OTHER THING AXE

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.250
SO- I WANT TO KNOW DOES THAT

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:22.120
INCLUDE OR PRECLUDE DIGITAL

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:23.355
CURRENCY- THAT'S A VERY GOOD

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:24.856
QUESTION US. COM LONGER. I THINK

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:27.192
WE HAVE A DRESS THAT UP TO THE

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.860
EXTENT THE DIGITAL TUR CURRENCY

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:31.163
CANNOT BE TRACED IT WOULD NOT BE

00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:35.634
A VALID FORM OF PAYMENT. BUT IT

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.403
IT CAN BE SO THEN. SO JUST

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.272
BECAUSE THAT SILENT DOESN'T MEAN

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:41.940
IT PROHIBITS- THAT'S CORRECT BUT

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.408
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AROUND

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.611
IT OUR FOLKS WHO STILL CATALYTIC

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:48.413
CONVERTERS. THEN THEY SELL THEM

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.248
TO A RECYCLER FOR EXAMPLE FOR

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:51.516
CASH AND SO WE CAN'T IDENTIFY

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:53.885
THOSE WHO'VE STOLEN OR THOSE ARE

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:55.887
IN THE BUSINESS OF COLLECTING

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:56.588
STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS.

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.957
THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:00.525
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:03.895
ARMED COMMITTEE. I HAVE ONE IN

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:05.831
EACH HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:08.100
THAT AND I THINK THE NEW COLLAR

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.835
CAR DEALERS PRESENTATION STATED

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:13.138
THAT- THE NUMBERS ARE INJURED

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:15.440
VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE CAR WHY

00:21:15.507 --> 00:21:17.743
SHOULDN'T MANUFACTURES JUST NOW

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.845
START. ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE OF

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:22.547
INCLUDING THE VIN NUMBER THAT

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:23.749
WOULD BE A LOT SIMPLER THAN

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.851
HAVING A CAR IT IS SIMPLE AND

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:27.252
THEN ON THE DEALER'S SHOWROOM

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.654
AND NOW HAVING TO HAVE TO. GO

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.490
BACK IN AT THAT NUMBER AND NEW

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:34.660
CAR DEALERS OR ALLIANCE CAN

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:35.961
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YEAH

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:36.828
MISTER CHAIR HAPPY TO ADDRESS

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:39.464
THAT THAT QUESTION. THAT WOULD.

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:42.034
AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE- PRODUCTION

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.602
FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:45.370
TRYING TO SUPPLY THE ENTIRE

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:46.972
WORLD WITH CARS SOME OF THOSE

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.540
ARE BUILT HERE IN CENTER.

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.909
OVERSEAS SUMMER BILL PERVERSE

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.644
AND SENT HERE- THE CATALYTIC

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:54.813
CONVERTER AND OTHER COMPONENTS

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.015
OF THE VEHICLE OR SOME OF THE

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:58.850
LAST THINGS PUT ON THE VEHICLE

00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:00.619
BUT THERE BEFORE THEY'RE

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:01.987
SHIPPED. AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:02.721
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHIPPED

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:05.991
WHICH COUNTRY AND SO TO RETOOL

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:08.093
ALL OF OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.228
WOULD COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:12.531
OF DOLLARS TO STAMP THE YOU KNOW

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:13.699
TO STAMP THE VAN ON THE

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:15.367
CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND AS I

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.235
PREVIOUSLY STATED WE ARE

00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:19.004
CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL DAMAGE

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:20.706
TO CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:23.375
THEIR AIR QUALITY IMPACT IF THEY

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:27.379
ARE STAMPED OR ENGRAVED LASTLY-

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:29.114
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.717
THINK THE COMMITTEE TO KEEP IN

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:34.920
MIND IS THIS YOU KNOW IF THAT

00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:38.724
WERE. A SALUTE OF. LOVINS AS WE

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.094

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.029
ADOPTION OF THE A. R. P.'S-

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:48.934
ADVANCED CLEAN CARS TO RULE- BY

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.701
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND STAGES

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:52.137

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:53.572
WE WILL BE SELLING MORE ZERO

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:54.840
EMISSION VEHICLES IN THE STATE

00:22:54.906 --> 00:22:57.175
WHICH DON'T HAVE CATALYTIC

00:22:57.242 --> 00:23:02.347
CONVERTERS. GOT A- ALL RIGHT.

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:04.850
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS KERN TINA

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:06.251
TURNER- BURKE CENTER FOR

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:07.719
INTERNAL TALK CLOSE UP THANK YOU

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.688
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF TO

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:14.092
ADDRESS THE QUESTION.

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.094
SOLUTION IT WOULD BE BEST IF THE

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:17.963
MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY HAD THE

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.331
NUMBER ON THE CATALYTIC

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:20.298
CONVERTER THE POINT OF

00:23:20.365 --> 00:23:21.566
MANUFACTURE WE DON'T HAVE

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:23.735
JURISDICTION THOUGH TO- REQUIRE

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:26.304
THAT MANUFACTURERS DO SO- THE

00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:27.272
POINT'S WELL TAKEN THAT

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:29.541
ULTIMATELY PRESS WILL ALL HAVE

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:30.642
ELECTRIC VEHICLES WITHOUT THAT'S

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:32.677
SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW IN THE

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.546
MEANTIME THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:37.082
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- AND

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:38.483
FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I URGE A

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.886
NO VOTE AND PORTANTINO. NO I

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:42.888
THINK MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT WELL

00:23:42.954 --> 00:23:44.222
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO

00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:48.293
BE SOLVED- THESE PARTS ARE BEING

ONE STUDENT BEHAVIOR IS

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:24.682
CLASSIFIED AS A THREAT BECAUSE

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.350
THE THREAT REMAINS VERY BROAD

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:28.619
GOING FAR BEYOND BEHAVIORS THAT

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:31.856

00:42:07.224 --> 00:42:08.826
BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.861
NEED HELP EARLY BEFORE THERE IS

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:13.330

THERE WAS IF IT WAS- ONLY

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:40.577
EXCLUSIVE TO CASUALTIES THAT CAN

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:42.746

IF FOLKS ARE YOU KNOW. WE'RE

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:54.992
VERY FOCUSED ON VIOLENT CREDIBLE

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:57.694
THREAT I MEAN IF THERE IS A

00:44:57.761 --> 00:45:00.097
TEENAGER ON FACEBOOK. MAKING A

THREAT. OF VIOLENCE AGAINST

THEIR PEERS ARE AGAINST THEIR

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:06.236
TEACHER AGAINST THE COUNSELOR-

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:08.539
THEY DON'T OFTEN IDENTIFY WHICH

00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:09.940
WEAPON OF CHOICE THEY'RE GOING

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:12.609
TO BE. COMING TO SCHOOL WITH BUT

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:15.079
IT'S ABOUT VIOLENT THREATS IT'S

00:45:15.145 --> 00:45:18.615
NOT ABOUT. FRANKLY DRUGS OR

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:21.685
ALCOHOL OR THOSE OTHER. SOCIAL

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:22.820
THINGS THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:25.756
THIS BILL THIS IS A N. AND AGAIN

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:28.959
WE KNOW AND I THINK I MAY BE

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:29.693
WRONG WHEN 90% OF THESE

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.063
INSTANCES THERE HAS BEEN SOME.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.366
FREE WARNING SOME PRECURSOR- AND

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:39.069
IN 67% OF THESE INSTANCES THE

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:42.005
WEAPONS COME FROM THE HOME- SO.

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:44.374
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:48.011
VIOLENT. THREAT TO THE SAFETY OF

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:49.880
A SCHOOL- AND AGAIN I GO BACK TO

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:51.415
MICHIGAN WHERE THAT SCHOOL WAS

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:53.317
ALERTED TO THE INTENT OF THAT

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:55.419
SHOOTER. AND DID NOTHING THAT'S

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:57.321
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. SO IN THIS

00:45:57.387 --> 00:46:02.559
INSTANCE- ALSO I IN VIEW YOU IF

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:06.530
IT'S OKAY TO IF YOU HAVE- SOME

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:08.966
OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:09.633
OPPOSITION I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.401
ARE STILL BEING SORT OF A

00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:14.972
DISCUSS- BUT I WILL SAY THAT

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:16.907
EIGHTY I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW A

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:19.176
THREAT IS DEEMED CREDIT CREDIBLE

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:20.711
WHOIN THIS INSTANCE WOULD BE

00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:22.613
MAKING THAT DETERMINATION IS

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:25.816
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT MAY

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.017
NOT KNOW THAT CHILDREN. THEN

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:29.653
WHICH- HOW THEY'RE BEHAVING IN

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.522
SCHOOL IS AT THE SCHOOL

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:36.093
ADMINISTRATORS- AND THEN- IF IT

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.630
TURNS OUT THAT THAT IS NOT

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:41.999
CREDIBLE RIGHT YOU STILL GONE

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:44.868
THROUGH THIS INVESTIGATION YOU

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:46.803
HAVE TARGETED PEOPLE YOUNG KIDS

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.238
YOU HAVE CALLED THEM YOU'VE DONE

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:51.675
ALL OF THIS AND SO THEN WHEN

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:54.511
THAT HAPPENS- THERE'S A- SIMPLE

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:55.979
. AS YOU'VE ALSO CREATED A

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:58.815
SITUATION WHERE YOU SORT OF

00:46:58.882 --> 00:47:00.617
CREATED A SCAPEGOAT OUT OF A

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:01.652
CHILD. NGUYEN IN THE INSTANCE

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:03.220
THE THREAT IS NOT DEEMED

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:04.521
CREDIBLE CREDIBLE OR MAYBE

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:06.023
ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN IT TURNS

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:09.526
OUT THAT IT WAS FALSE- I AM MOST

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:11.195
CURIOUS ABOUT SORT OF THE

00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:13.263
CONSEQUENCES IN AFTER EFFECTS.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.998
OF THAT BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:16.466
ABOUT SORT OF SPECULATIVE WHICH

00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:19.136
ON. THAT COULD THEN HAPPEN UNDER

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:22.706
THE AUSPICES OF THE BILL. SO IF.

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.508
THE FOLKS OUT OF SCHOOL

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:25.509
DETERMINE IT NOT TO BE A

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:26.843
CREDIBLE THREAT. I'M NOT GOING

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.646
TO INVESTIGATE. SO THAT'S THE

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:32.115
WHOLE CRUX OF IT. IF IT'S A

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:33.884
CREDIBLE THREAT AND LET ME BACK

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:35.919

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:39.856
INVESTIGATION WERE NOT CHANGING

00:47:39.923 --> 00:47:41.158

AUTHORITIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS-

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.796
THEY ALREADY CAN DO THIS AND IT

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.731
IS A LOWER STANDARD ALREADY IN

00:47:47.798 --> 00:47:49.233
CALIFORNIA LAW THEN PROBABLY

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.435
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:53.604
OF THAT. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.774
JUST LIKE A- MANDATORY REPORTER-

00:47:57.841 --> 00:48:00.077
PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST IN

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:03.513
A- ABUSE CASE WHEN THAT PERSON

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.618

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:13.624
SAME PRINCIPLE HERE WE'RE NOT

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.459
TRYING TO PROFILE ANYBODY WE'RE

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:19.329
NOT TRYING TO- TO GO AFTER

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:20.931
THINGS THAT ARE UNNECESSARY OR

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:22.499
NOT GERMANE OR NOT ADDED TO A

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:24.768
VIOLENT THREAT- WE HAVE

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.436
NARROWED. SOME OF THE

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:27.838
DEFINITIONS BASED ON THE

00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:30.274
FEEDBACK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.275
TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT

00:48:31.341 --> 00:48:33.944
THE POINT IS IF USE PREVENT A

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:35.779
VIOLENT THREAT FROM HAPPENING IF

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:36.546
YOU'VE PREVENTIVE VIOLENT

00:48:36.613 --> 00:48:38.982
ACTION. THANK GOODNESS WE

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:41.685
PREVENTED IT- IF THEY LOOK AT

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:42.953
THIS INFORMATION AND THEY

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.221
DETERMINED THAT IT'S NOT A

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:45.889
CREDIBLE THREAT AND THEY DON'T

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.824
TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP THAT'S

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:50.260
GOOD BUT IF THEY DETERMINE IT'S

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:51.128
A VIOLENT THREAT AND THEY

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:52.195
INVESTIGATED AND WE PREVENT

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.298
SOMETHING. YOU CAN'T THEN SAY

00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:56.400
WELL THEY PREVENTED IT

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.635
THEREFORE. THERE WAS NO. BENEFIT

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.070
AND SO THAT'S THE SWEET SPOT

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:03.206
WE'RE TRYING TO HIT- AND WILL

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:05.375
CONTINUE TO REFINE IT AS

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:07.344
APPROPRIATELY AND WE HAVE MADE

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:08.245
WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF-

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:10.547
SUGGESTIONS. AND ACCESS THE

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.816
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS- WE'VE

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:15.085
BEEN TALKING WITH THE ACLU. BUT

00:49:15.152 --> 00:49:17.354
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. HAVE

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:18.889
A SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T WAKE

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:20.924
UP AFTER A MASS SHOOTING AND SAY

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.926
I WISH WE COULD HAVE. WERE WE

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:26.296
SHOULD HAVE. AND NOT. AND THAT'S

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:27.731
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.399
WILL WE EVER MAKE EVERYBODY

00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:31.101

00:49:35.205 --> 00:49:37.407
THAT EVERYBODY GETS EXACTLY WHAT

WHAT WAS DONE- AND AT THE END OF

00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:52.416
THE DAY- IT'S A BALANCE BETWEEN

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:56.920
SAFETY. AND PRIVACY- AND ALSO

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:58.755
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:01.191

THE ROLE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

THE ACTIONS OF THOSE WHO ARE IN

00:55:29.225 --> 00:55:31.061
A DESPERATE MENTAL HEALTH STATE

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:34.164
. AN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT YET

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.599
AND MAYBE IT'LL NET MAYBE IT'S

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:38.601
JUST NOT EVER GOING TO BE AT THE

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.236
PLACE WHERE IT IS REALLY THE

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:42.572
APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO DEAL WITH

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:45.608

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:47.377
AND WE HAVE TOOLS NOW THINGS

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:50.080
LIKE BE A RED FLAG LOWERED THE

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:51.047
GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:53.983
WHICH- AND OFF I FELT CONFIDENT

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.118
THAT THE INVOLVEMENT OF LAW

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.686
ENFORCEMENT WOULD IT WOULD

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.722
RESULT IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:01.357
WHERE BUT THE FAMILY BECAUSE IN

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:03.727
MY OPINION AND I'M SURE THOSE

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:06.229
WHO ARE- YOU KNOW THOSE

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:08.498
AFFILIATED WITH THE NRA AND SUCH

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:09.999
NOW FOR IT WOULD NOT AGREE WITH

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:12.836
ME BUT I FEEL LIKE. WITH THERE'S

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:15.438
A KID MAKING CREDIBLE THREATS-

00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:17.574
THAT'S A RED FLAG SHOULD BE PUT

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.275
ON THE WHOLE FAMILY BECAUSE

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:21.010
THERE SHOULD BE A GUN IN THE

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:22.545
HOUSE THERE'S A GUN IN THE HOUSE

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:24.314
THE KID MIGHT USE IT REGARDLESS

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.082
OF THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE-

00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:28.685
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT. AND I

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:32.322
RATHER SEE TOOLS LIKE THAT USE.

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:33.656
THEN THE TYPE OF TOOLS THAT

00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:34.991
RESULT IN CRIMINALIZING THE

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:39.863
CHILD OR- ANYWAY SO WHAT I'M

00:56:39.929 --> 00:56:42.966
STRUGGLING WITH IS THAT. WELL I

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:45.735

THAT WE ARE WE WANT WE WANT TO

00:56:50.006 --> 00:56:51.608
PREVENT THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WE

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:52.776
WANT TAKE THE THREATS CREDIBLY.

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:54.544
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS FINE LINE

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:55.578
OF HOW THESE CHILDREN ARE

00:56:55.645 --> 00:56:57.113
TREATED WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.250
AND WHAT THAT YOU KNOW AFTER IF

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:02.719
IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:04.988
IT'S NOT ALWAYS. NEITHER THE

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:06.689
SCHOOL OR LAW ENFORCEMENT ALWAYS

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:12.228
HAS EITHER. ONE AND SO I'M I'M

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:13.696
NOT GOING TO OPPOSE THE BILL I

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:16.199
WILL SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I AND

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.767
I DON'T KNOW IF I WERE IN YOUR

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:19.202
POSITION CHAIR AS BEING FOREIGN

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:21.037
CARE WHAT TYPE OF AMENDMENT

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:24.274
MIGHT HELP WHAT I'M STRUGGLING

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.743
WITH BUT THAT IS WHAT I'M

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:29.179
STRUGGLING. SO AND I DON'T KNOW

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:30.413
WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.949
HAPPEN WHETHER THERE'S ANY WAY

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:36.686
TO. BUT ANYWAY. THANK YOU IF I

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.788
COULD COMMENT RIGHT HERE AT THE

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:39.689
CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:41.858
CONTINUOUS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:44.093
TO WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS A

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.962
PROBLEM AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:47.163
IT RIGHT- I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:48.798
THE FINAL VERSION IS GOING TO

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:51.301
LOOK LIKE- BUT WE ARE HAVING

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:54.604
PRODUCTIVE- FRANKLY I THINK ONE

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:55.805
OF THE PROVISIONS THAT'S BEEN

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:58.374
TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL WHICH IS

00:57:58.441 --> 00:57:59.976
TO KNOW WHAT. ACTUAL WEAPONS

00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:01.411
WERE AVAILABLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:02.779
I THINK MAYBE THERE'S EVEN A

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:05.315
STRONGER BILL BUT UNFORTUNATELY

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:07.650
THAT WAS TWO POINT TWO FAR FOR

00:58:07.717 --> 00:58:11.921
SOME FOLKS ROM BUT WE'RE TRYING

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:14.023
TO HIT THE SWEET SPOT I MEAN I

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:14.657
THINK THAT THE QUESTION YOU'RE

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:17.961
ASKING IS THE- BUT WE DO. THAT

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:21.197
THE SHOOTERS MAKE IT KNOWN THEY

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:23.700
MAKE THEIR INTENT KNOWN. WE KNOW

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:26.035
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A WEAPON

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.937
WHEN THEY PROBABLY SHOULDN'T-

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:30.073
AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:32.675
WAY TO EMPOWER THE DISTRICT. TO

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:34.277
DEAL WITH IT APPROPRIATELY AND

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:35.078
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

OBVIOUSLY HOPEFULLY MOOSE IT

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:45.788
CONTINUES TO MOVE. BUT IT'S THE

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:48.791
RIGHT QUESTION. QUESTIONS OR

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:51.828
CONCERNS SIMILAR TO A BOOK- SOME

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:54.330
IMPORTANT TO KNOW. NO WE'VE BEEN

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:55.531
HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND I'VE

00:58:55.598 --> 00:59:00.336
JUST BEEN VERY CONFLICTED BUT-

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:01.738
HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:04.540
CONCERN THAT- FIRST OF ALL DO

00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:05.608
YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:07.844

ACTED SWIFTLY IN ADDRESSING THE

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:29.999
CONCERN. I'M JUST KIND OF

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:32.101
CURIOUS AS TO I MEAN I KNOW WHAT

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:34.203
THE MOTIVATION IS YOU WANT TO

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.539

COMPELS YOU TO THINK THAT

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.852
THERE'S ACTUALLY A NEED FOR SUCH

00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:51.721
A BILL IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE

00:59:51.788 --> 00:59:53.423
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA

00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:55.325
BEING A SENSITIVE AS WE ARE

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:57.026
WITH. VARIOUS ISSUES HERE IN IN

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:58.728
CALIFORNIA. THAT WE ACTUALLY

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:01.798
NEED THIS TYPE OF BUILT TO BE IN

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:04.133
PLACE THAT- THAT ADDRESSES THE

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.668
ISSUE THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:06.903
ACTUALLY NEED BECAUSE OF THE

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.305
PROTOCOLS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:11.240
IN LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TWO

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:12.075
THINGS FOR THOSE SCHOOL

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.177
DISTRICTS THAT. TAKE CREDIBLE

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:17.113
THREATS I SERIOUSLY IS THE ONE

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.449
YOU'RE YOU'RE REFERENCING. FRANK

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:20.717
FOR THE BE NO IMPACT ON THAT

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:21.818
SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE- THEY

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.753
GET A THREAT NAY THEY ACT UPON

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.488
BUT I HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:26.789
DISTRICTS WHERE. THEY WRESTLE

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:30.526
WITH. DO WE DO WE INVESTIGATE

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.695
DON'T WE INVESTIGATE DOES THIS

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.264
HAPPEN HERE AND I HAVE I HAVE

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.833
BEEN MADE AWARE OF SOME SCHOOL

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:38.301
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE WRESTLED

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:41.237
WITH THIS ISSUE- I CAN'T NAME

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.472
THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:43.973
I'M IN CONFIDENCE ON ON SOME OF

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.310
THAT STUFF- BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.444
WE'VE HAD. THE SHOOTINGS IN

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:52.181
CALIFORNIA- AND SO. YOU NEVER

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:53.883
KNOW WHEN YOU PREVENT SOMETHING.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:56.719
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW. IF THAT

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.621
ACTUALLY LEADS TO A PREVENTION

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:01.057
BUT WE KNOW THIS WELL. AND SO

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.592
THAT'S SORT OF. GETTING OUT OF

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:04.027
FROM BOTH SIDES THE DISTRICTS

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:06.095
THAT ARE PROACTIVE. WE'RE GOING

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.964
TO SEE NO EFFECT THE DISTRICTS

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:09.599
THAT ARE. ONLY GOING TO BE

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:11.567
FORCED TO DO SOMETHING. AND

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:12.935
THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.704
TRYING TO SOLVE AND I AM USING

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.272
MICHIGAN BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.774
RECENT EXAMPLE WHERE THEY

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.443
RECEIVED A CREDIBLE THREAT SAT

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.345
ON IT AND THEN THERE WAS A

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:22.979
TRAGEDY. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.380
QUESTION WOULD BE TO YOUR

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:27.383
COMMENTS. DO YOU FEEL THAT IT

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.919
WOULD BE. SINCE MANY OF THE

SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE ACTING IN

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:34.590
CONFIDENCE OR SPEAKING-CONFIDENCE DO YOU THINK THAT WE

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.292
SHOULD PROCEED WITH DATA

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.928
COLLECTION TO SEE IF THERE IS

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:41.564
SUCH A NEED. IDON'T WANT TO

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:43.666

COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING AND A

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:55.278
TEENAGER WAS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.080

HAS TO DEAL WITH THIS WHEN WE

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.432
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS THE

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:50.733
LEGISLATURE TO PUT IN PLACE

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.037

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.491
THERE WILL BE SOME BIASES HERE

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:39.195
AND HOW THIS IS. AN ACTIVE IT IS

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:41.897
TO PUT THE PAST. I ACTUALLY

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:42.631
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:45.601
OPPOSITE I THINK I THINK YOU'RE

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:49.338
GONNA SEE. MORE MORE OF AN

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:49.939
IMPACT ON THE SUBURBAN

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:52.341
COMMUNITIES I THINK YOU'RE GONNA

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.744
SEE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.979
WHERE THE GREATER FEAR OF ACTION

01:06:57.046 --> 01:07:01.717
COMES OR INACTION COMES- AND-

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.652
AGAIN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.187
PROFILING WE'RE NOT TALKING

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:06.856
ABOUT TARGETING ANYBODY WE'RE

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:09.425
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DEFINING

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.694
WHAT A CREDIBLE THREAT IS AN

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.562
ACTING UPON IT SO IT'S

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.531
COUNTERINTUITIVE MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:17.366
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:20.302
GREATER IMPACT OF THIS BILL- ON

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:23.406
SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:25.307
KNOW HOW REPRESENT URBAN AND

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:28.778
SUBURBAN COMMITTEE. WHERE THE

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:32.448
THAT WON'T HAPPEN HERE. IS MUCH

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:33.983
MORE PREVALENT AND I THINK

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:36.018
THAT'S WHY THIS IS GOING TO HAVE

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.353
MORE OF A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.288
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAN THE URBAN

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:41.257
COMMUNITIES. THAT'S DESPITE MY

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.192
AGAIN THAT'S AN EMPIRICAL

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.861
OPINION. BUT I YOU'RE AGAIN

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.696
YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT%

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:48.564
QUESTION. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:50.065
TO FOCUS ON THE DEFINITION TO

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.934
MAKE SURE WE GO AFTER IT THE

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.803
RIGHT WAY. BUT I THINK THIS IS

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.871
GOING TO HAVE A GREATER EFFECT-

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:57.773
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES NOT NOT THE

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.208
ONES THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:01.811
REFERENCING IN MY OPINION- WHICH

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:04.914
I CLOSE. WITH THAT THAT YOU KNOW

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.816
YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN GREAT AS WE

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:07.950
MOVE THIS FROM ONE COMMITTED TO

01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:09.652
THAN OTHERS TO PROCESS THE IMAGE

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:11.720
THAT WE TOOK IN IN EDUCATION TO

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:13.355
GET IT TO WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:14.824
AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.492

FORWARD- THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:26.635

CONVERTER THEFTS WITH A HREE

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:31.734
PRONGED APPROACH. FIRST THIS

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.536
BILL REQUIRES NEW AND USED MOTOR

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:35.237
VEHICLE DEALERS APPARENTLY

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:35.638

CATALYTIC CONVERTER OF ANY

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:41.010
VEHICLE BEFORE THEY SELL. THIS

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:43.112
REQUIREMENT WILL READ WILL

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.446
CREATE A WAY TO IDENTIFY

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:46.882
CALIBERS. IF IT IS ILLEGALLY

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:49.451
REMOVED FROM THE CAR. SECOND

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:51.954
THIS BILL ALLOWS METAL RECYCLERS

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:53.455
TO BY KELLY CONVERTERS ONLY IF

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:55.424
THEY HAVE A CLEARLY VISIBLE AND

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.159
UN TAMPERED BEEN ON THEM.

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:58.861
RECYCLES IT ASO BE REQUIRED TO

KEEP DETAILED RECORDS OF ALL

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.597
SALES FROM BOTH BUSINESSES AND

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.899
INDIVIDUALS AND MAKE THOSE

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.434
RECORDS AVAILABLE TO LAW

ADDS FINES TO THE CURRENT.

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.406
PENALTIES FOR CALIFORNIA THEFT

01:10:10.472 --> 01:10:11.907
AND MAKES IT EASIER TO ESTABLISH

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:14.376
PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST AND

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:15.311
PROSECUTION. I KNOW ADDITIONAL

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:16.645
PENALTIES TEND TO BE DIFFICULT

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:18.380
IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE REALLY

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:19.915
DO BELIEVE THIS PORTION IS

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.684
CRUCIAL TO MAKING IT NOT WORK

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.452
THE THIEVES TIME TO KEEP

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:25.721
STEALING THESE DEVICES. SOME OF

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.623
YOU MAY SEE MY VIDEO ON HOW EASY

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:28.724
IT IS TO STEAL A CATALYTIC

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:30.559
CONVERTER AND I WANTED TO SHOW

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:31.694
THE COMMITTEE WITH A CATALOG

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.062
NUMBER ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE. THIS

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:37.900
IS A- A REAL AFTERMARKET- KELLY

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.135
CONVERTER. AND IT IS THE HOT

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:41.136
COMMODITY BECAUSE OF THE

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:42.938
PRECIOUS METALS. AND THE RISING

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.740
COST OF THESE METALS CALIFORNIA

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:47.042
IS THE NUMBER ONE STATE. IN THE

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.944
NATION FOR CALCULATOR THEFTS.

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.846
WITH EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DEATHS

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:54.416
JUST LAST YEAR. THAT'S A 13100%

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:57.019
INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.487
NINETEEN. WHAT IF CAN STILL

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:00.956
CALIBURN UNDER TWO MINUTES AND

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:02.358
MAKE A QUICK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.893
DOLLARS. THE VICTIMS OF THESE

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.295
STEPS FACE UP TO FOUR THOUSAND

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:07.963
DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE CONVERTER

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.632
AND THE LOSS OF THE VEHICLE WELL

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.900
THERE'S GET FIXED AND WE'VE ALSO

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:13.836
HEARD STORIES OF. THE VALUE OF

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.437
REPLACING THE CALCULATOR

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.906
ACTUALLY TOTALS THE VEHICLE AND

01:11:17.973 --> 01:11:19.375
MAKES IT NOT WORTHREPAIRING.

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:20.409
THIS PROBLEM HAS ONLY GOTTEN

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.077
WORSE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:24.046
AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:24.680
SLOWING DOWN. THUS MAKING OUR

INCORPORATES A COMPREHENSIVE

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:33.122
STRATEGY TACKLE CATALYTIC

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:34.256

DEPARTMENT. CATALYTIC CONVERTERS

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.648
ALL CATS ARE THE PERFECT TARGET

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:34.583
FOR THIEVES BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.285
VALUABLE FOR SIMPLE THE STEEL

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:38.954
IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE. AND

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.556
UNFORTUNATELY HAS NO RECOURSE.

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:41.857
ADDITIONAL STOLEN PROPERTY IS A

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:44.126
CRIME AGAINST A PERSON. SO THAT

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.095
A PERSON OR VICTIM THERE'S NO

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.429
CRIME OFFICERS LOCATE CATS

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:49.064
DURING TRAFFIC STOPS KNOW THAT

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:50.833
THEIR STOLEN. BUT CAN'T PROVE IT

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:53.502
THE SUSPECTS ARE NEVER HELD

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:54.536
ACCOUNTABLE. SAN DIEGO COUNTY

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.572
HAD OVER TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED CAT

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:58.207
DEATHS REPORTED IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:12:58.273 --> 01:12:59.708
ONE AND DEBT IN MY CITY

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.343
INCREASED BY SEVEN HUNDRED

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.377
PERCENT. THIS YEAR'S LOOKING

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:04.313
WORSE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:05.981
WHERE PEOPLE PARK ON THE STREET

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.649
OR UNSECURE LOTS ARE SPECIALLY

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:10.018
VULNERABLE. AND I'VE MET VICTIMS

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.987
LIKE CLAUDIAN JORGE WHO CAN'T

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.922
AFFORD TO REPAIR THEIR STOLEN

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:15.824
CATS SO NOW THEY MAKE PAYMENTS

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.993
ON CARS THAT THEY CAN'T USE.%

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:18.794
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:20.095
CURRENT LAW CREATED A BLACK

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:21.330
MARKET THROUGH MINIMAL OVERSIGHT

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.865
OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CAP

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:25.033
TRANSACTIONS. SO IF I WERE TO

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.002
FILE A FICTITIOUS BUSINESS NAME

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.270
APPLICATION WITH THE COUNTY. I

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.805
COULD SELL CATS TO RECYCLE IT

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:31.206
NOW THE ONLY LOG MY BUSINESS

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:33.175
THING. THE RECYCLERS ARE ACTING

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.877
WITHIN THE LAW AND THEY CAN

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:35.778
COMMITMENTS BECAUSE THE STOLEN

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.513
CAT HAS ALREADY BEEN LAUNDERED

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:03.685
MODEL CARS WITH CATALYTIC

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:06.721
CONVERTERS- YOU KNOW CAN'T

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:08.690
REALLY AFFORD TO AND EVEN

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:09.991
WORKING CLASS FOLKS CAN'T EVEN

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:11.660
AFFORD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:13.962
OF REPLACING THEM. I THINK IT'S

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:16.164
A HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE-

01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:18.066
HAVING TO REPLACE THEM AND WE

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:19.901
SHOULD BE MOVING AWAY FROM IT.

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:22.270
AND I DO AGREE WE SHOULD BE

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:25.206
CREATING A CHILLING A FACT- ON

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:26.641
THOSE WHO TRADE ON CATALYTIC

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:29.944
CONVERTERS- AND WE NEED TO

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:31.713
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO START THE

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:36.184
BLACK MARKET. ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:42.757
ARM AND- ALSO. YOU KNOW I HAVE

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:44.292
CONCERNS ABOUT NOT NEEDING

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:47.562
PROBABLE CAUSE TO MAKE AN ARREST

01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:49.364
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A SLIPPERY

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:52.667
SLOPE TOWARDS- POLICY THAT WE

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.035
HAVEN'T REALLY SUPPORTED

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:57.872
GENERALLY- IN THIS COMMITTEE AND

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:59.808
YOU KNOW LEANING ON

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:02.077
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. SEEMS

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:04.012
TO BE AS CAVALIER AS THE FOLKS

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:05.613
WHO ARE OUT HERE YOU KNOW

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.549
STEALING THESE CATALYTIC

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:10.051
CONVERTERS AND I ALSO WONDER

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:12.520
BECAUSE OF THE THAT LANGUAGE

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:15.757
THAT'S ALSO IN THE BILL- NO CHEN

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:19.227
CUFFS. IS THE INTENT TO GO

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:23.431
AFTER. THE PERSON WHO STOLE IT.

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:26.101
OR JUST THE PERSON WHO HAPPENS

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.703
TO BE HOLDING THE PROPERTY. YOU

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.106
KNOW AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:32.907
BECAUSE THAT PERSON COULD

01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:34.976
EQUALLY BE UNSUSPECTING AND I

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.378
WOULD THINK WE WOULD WANT

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.179
LANGUAGE OR BILLS THAT ARE GOING

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:40.582
AFTER THE ACTUAL THIEVES OR EVEN

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:42.984
THINK THE RING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.253
INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF THEFT.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.788
BUT THE PROBABLE CAUSE NOT

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.022
HAVING PROBABLE CAUSE IN THE

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.858
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. YOU

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.559
KNOW COULD LEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.495
TO SAY WELL WE'RE JUST GOING TO.

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:54.562
TRY TO TEACH ALL THESE FOLKS A

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:56.731
LESSON AND SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:57.966
HAVE IT IN YOUR POSSESSION RIGHT

01:23:58.032 --> 01:23:59.534
NOW EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T STEAL

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.469
IT BUT MAYBE IT WAS LIKE SECOND

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:03.238
HAND THIRD HAND PURCHASE OR

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:04.105
WHATEVER. THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:06.107
AFTER YOU WHICH ISN'T

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:08.309
NECESSARILY ATTACKING B. THE

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.645
ISSUE AT HAND WHICH IS HOW DO WE

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.814
SORT OF START OF. THIS BLACK

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.716
MARKET GO AFTER THOSE THAT ARE

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:15.750
STEALING IT SO I DON'T KNOW IF

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:16.885
THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:18.386
HAPPENING WITH- THE COMMITTEE TO

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:20.789
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEAN

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:23.758
INTO. THAT SWEET SPOT- AND

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:25.627
ESSENTIALLY THIS IS MAYBE A LONG

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:28.096
DIATRIBE TOWARDS ASKING IF

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:29.264
YOU'VE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:32.367
SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.803
THE OPPOSITION. SURE SO. ON THE

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:37.472
FIRST POINT OF CONSOLIDATING I

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.240
THINK ALL OF IT I THERE'S THREE

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:40.975
BILLS IN THE SENATE THAT FROM MY

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.310
UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A BILL IN

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:44.112
THE ASSEMBLY AT LEAST ONE BILL

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:44.946
IN THE ASSEMBLY. MY STAFF HAS

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.281
HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:47.749
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATE

01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:49.784
OFFICES THAT ARE. PROPOSING

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:54.155
CALIFORNIA BILLS- SO. I WOULD

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:55.924
IMAGINE. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:57.525
PROCESS OF THE YOU KNOW THE

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:58.526
LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE PROCESS IS

01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:00.094
TO. GET ALL THESE IDEAS DOWN

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:03.097
INTO ONE IDEA THAT THEY CAN. BE

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:05.867
USEFUL IN AND- EFFECTIVE.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.303
CONCERNING IN THE POSSESSION OF

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.605
A STOLEN ITEM AND WHAT YOU KNOW

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:13.575
UNKNOWINGLY- AS AN INNOCENT

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:16.845
INTERMEDIARY OR INNOCENT PERSON

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:19.247
IN THE IN THE- CHAIN OF

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:21.916
POSSESSION BETWEEN THE FAST AND

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:24.118
THE RECYCLER. THERE'S PROBABLY A

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:25.620
VERY LIMITED SITUATION WHERE

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:27.722
THAT MIGHT COME UP I THINK LAW

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:31.392
ENFORCEMENT'S OPINION IS- YOU

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:33.394
KNOW THE PERSON STEALING IN THE-

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:35.330
CALIBRATOR IS THE SAME PERSON

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.532
THAT SELLING IT TO THE RECYCLER-

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:41.202
THAT WOULD BE VERY LITTLE REASON

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:42.871
FOR THERE TO BE AN EXCHANGE.

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:43.505
BETWEEN THAT THOSE TWO

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:46.508
TRANSACTIONS- SO I THINK THAT

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.943
THIS BILL WITH IDENTIFICATION

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.912
BEING REQUIRED ON THE CATALYTIC

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.381
CONVERTER TREAT ELIMINATE SOME

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:56.885
OF THAT- A SUSPICION AND- I'M

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:58.653
SORRY I MISSED THE TERM THAT YOU

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.923
USED- CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE-

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.525
BY HAVING THE VIN NUMBER ON

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.627
ORIENT I DIVIDE I DIDN'T FIND

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:08.630
NUMBER ON THE- ON THE- KELLY

01:26:08.696 --> 01:26:11.165
CONVERTER- EVERY. REMOVE SOME OF

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:12.734
THAT BECAUSE NOW THAT KELLY

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.469
CONVERTER IS TRACEABLE TO A

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:16.871
VEHICLE. IT CAN BE PROVEN THAT

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.873
IT WAS THAT THAT VEHICLES NOW

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.241
MISSING A CATALYTIC CONVERTER

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:22.810
THAT CAL. VEHICLE WITH THIS VIN

01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:24.579
NUMBER MATCHES THIS CATALYTIC

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:28.550
CONVERTER. SOMEWHERE SOMEBODY-

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:30.151
REMOVED THAT CATALYTIC CONVERTER

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:32.987
ILLEGALLY AND SO I THINK THAT

01:26:33.054 --> 01:26:35.423
CREATES A GIVES A POLICE A

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:37.458
LEGITIMATE TOOL TO MAKE SURE

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:39.427
THAT THEY'RE- GOING AFTER THE

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:40.795
PROPER PERSON THAT STOLE THE

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.630
VEHICLE OF SOMEBODY IN IN YOUR

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.966
SITUATION. IF THERE IS A CASE

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:46.935
WHERE SOMEBODY HAS POSSESSION OF

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:48.369
A STOLEN COUNTY CONVERTER AND

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:49.571
THEY'RE NOT THE ONE THAT STOLE

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.673
IT. WELL NOW THE POLICE HAVE THE

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:52.740
OPPORTUNITY TO QUESTION THAT

01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:54.842
PERSON OR DO YOU GET IT YOU KNOW

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:56.578
WHY DO YOU HAVE IT- AND

01:26:56.644 --> 01:26:58.479
HOPEFULLY THEY HAVE. A

01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:00.248
LEGITIMATE STORY THAT. PROVES

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.416
THEIR INNOCENCE BUT SOMEBODY'S

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:17.599
GUILTY.

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:26.474
THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:27.475
TAKE POSSESSION OF STOLEN

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:31.112
PROPERTY AND SO. IT IN OREGON

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.547

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:39.487
BUSINESSES. TO GET AROUND YOU

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.557
KNOW ALL OF THIS AND SO I WOULD

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:43.858
SAY. TO YOUR POINT REGARDING-

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:46.327
YOU KNOW THE CRIMINALS LAZIER-

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:49.664
CAVALIER. SOME OF THEM MAY THAT

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.532
MAYBE TO SOME OF OUR VERY

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:53.501

THOUGHTFUL THING TO DO IS GO

BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THIS-

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:05.513
ACTIVITY. SO WE WANT TO OFFER

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.984

BY TWO- HAVE A LITTLE CONCERNED

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:19.694
WITH THE MERIT OF CATALYTIC

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:22.163
CONVERTER BILLS THAT ARE GOING

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:24.866
TO BOTH HOUSES IN THE LIST OF

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:26.868
CONCERNS AT A VENUE. FOR A VOICE

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:28.770
BY A NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS AS WELL

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.872
AS THE ALLIANCE SO HOW DO YOU

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:32.974
ADDRESS SOME OF THE- CONCERNS

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.843
THAT THEY HAVE A- SO I ON THE-

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:38.012
PREVIOUS- TESTIMONY I KNOW THAT

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:39.280
THERE WAS SOME MENTION-

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:40.648
REGARDING CATALYTIC CONVERTERS

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:42.450
THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO GET TO AND

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:43.685
REQUIRE HOURS OF TIME FOR EVEN

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:45.720
AT TRAINED TECHNICIAN TO GET TO.

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:47.121
THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE LIKE THE

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:48.589
PREVIOUS AUTHOR I WASN'T AWARE

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:49.857
OF UNTIL YOU INTERVIEWS THIS

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:52.160
BILL SO- WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:54.529
WAY TO PUT THAT LANGUAGE. INTO

01:28:54.595 --> 01:28:57.331
THE BILL THAT. WOULD BE- EXEMPT

01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:59.300
YOU KNOW THOSE TYPES OF VEHICLES

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:00.268
IF THEY CATHOLIC CONVERTERS

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.136
PART. INTEGRATED INTO THE

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:04.706
EXHAUST MANIFOLD. THAT IS NOT

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:07.308
GONNA GET STOLEN- WITHOUT CIVIL

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:08.876
STILL THE WHOLE CAR- THEN THE

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.078
KEYSTONE BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:29:10.144 --> 01:29:10.778
STILL JUST THE CATALYTIC

01:29:10.845 --> 01:29:12.580
CONVERTER. AT A SOMETHING LIKE

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:13.748
THAT SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:15.483
WAY YOU KNOW EITHER THROUGH THE

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:18.119
REPAIR MANUALS LANGUAGE OR- YOU

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.021
KNOW SOMEONE THAT WE CAN PUT

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:20.888
THAT. MAKE THAT LANGUAGE MAKES

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:22.590
SENSE- WE'VE HAD VERY GOOD

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.058
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ALLIANCE

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:26.094
AND WHAT THE NEW CAR DEALERS- I

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.262
USED TO WORK IN THE AUTO

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:28.763
INDUSTRY SO YOU KNOW I

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.798
UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS- WHEN

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.500
WE INTRODUCED THE BILL. I KNEW

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:34.402
THERE WAS GONNA BE CONCERNS BUT

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:36.003
WE HAD TO START A DIALOGUE START

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:38.239
THE CONVERSATION- AND I THINK

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:39.674
WORKING ALL OF US TOGETHER WE'RE

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:41.709
GOING TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE-

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:45.947
THIS BILL MAKES THE MOST SENSE

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:49.417
AND- AND MOVES ON. WE WERE

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:51.385
LOOKING FOR A MOTION ON THIS

02:01:38.491 --> 02:01:40.559
THINK THAT HAVING OPERABLE

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:46.866

LOCKDOWNS HAPPEN THROUGH NO

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:51.303
FAULT OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO

IN OUR DETENTION CENTERS AND ON

02:02:04.016 --> 02:02:06.252

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:16.429
THAT WAS STILL A RIGHT. I KNOW

02:02:16.495 --> 02:02:19.765
THAT AS A RESULT OF THE COSTS TO

02:02:21.333 --> 02:02:25.337

TIME THE STATEMENTS MADE. A

02:39:29.326 --> 02:39:30.928

02:39:30.994 --> 02:39:32.696
IN DURING THAT TIME BUT WE'RE

02:39:32.763 --> 02:39:33.764
NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT WE'RE

02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:35.565
TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:39:35.632 --> 02:39:37.267
TO DO AND WHY WE'RE LIMITING IT

02:39:37.334 --> 02:39:39.703

AROUND OUR OUR COUNTRY THAT

02:39:44.875 --> 02:39:45.709

SUPPLIES TO THOSE AND THAT LAW

TESTIMONY NATURE. CONFRONTATION

ALSO QUALIFY UNDER THE HEARSAY

02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:21.571
RULE ON THE VEGAS EXCEPTION. IT

02:41:21.638 --> 02:41:23.740

IS GOING TO BE WEAKER THE LONGER

02:41:34.818 --> 02:41:35.919
ONE WAITS RIGHT RIGHT IT WOULD

02:41:35.986 --> 02:41:37.854

MORE WITNESSES. WE'RE NOT.

02:41:53.503 --> 02:41:54.805
ALWAYS BACK TO COMMITTEE OKAY

02:41:54.871 --> 02:41:56.740
ANYMORE QUESTIONS ARE COMING

02:41:56.807 --> 02:42:00.277
FROM- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATOR

02:42:00.343 --> 02:42:03.914
SKINNER. ALL AGES FOR MISSING

02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:08.685
THE DISCUSSION SO FAR- BUT I AND

02:42:08.752 --> 02:42:10.720
MAYBE THIS WAS ADDRESSED SO BUT

02:42:10.787 --> 02:42:14.024
WHEN I READ THE ANALYSIS I SAW

02:42:14.091 --> 02:42:16.393
THAT THERE IS. THERE ARE

02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:18.728
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A MEDICAL

02:42:18.795 --> 02:42:21.998
PROFESSIONAL CAN YOU ENTER THIS

02:42:22.065 --> 02:42:25.001
HEARSAY EVIDENCE. AND IT'S NOT

02:42:25.068 --> 02:42:27.337
COMPLETELY PROHIBITED BUT ALSO

02:42:27.404 --> 02:42:29.873
SEE THAT WITH THE BILL'S TRYING

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:31.575
TO DO IS HELP THOSE SITUATIONS

02:42:31.641 --> 02:42:33.677
WHERE THE VICTIM THEMSELVES IS

02:42:33.743 --> 02:42:35.812
NOT WILLING TO COME FORWARD. AND

02:42:35.879 --> 02:42:38.215
I DISCUSSED WHAT'S TRICKY FOR ME

02:42:38.281 --> 02:42:41.685
AS- WE NEED TO SUPPORT VICTIMS

02:42:41.751 --> 02:42:43.887
WE WANT THEM I DON'T MEAN

02:42:43.954 --> 02:42:45.989
SUPPORT WE NEED TO. CREATE A

02:42:46.056 --> 02:42:48.258
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE VICTIMS FEEL

02:42:48.325 --> 02:42:50.861
COMFORTABLE AND SO THAT WE CAN

02:42:50.927 --> 02:42:51.928
PROSECUTE THESE CRIMES AND SO

02:42:51.995 --> 02:42:53.663
THAT WE CAN TRY TO STOP THE

02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:58.568
CYCLE. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT

02:42:58.635 --> 02:43:00.570
- TEMP LIKE HEROES DON'T ALWAYS

02:43:00.637 --> 02:43:03.173
WORK AND EVEN WHEN WE PROSECUTE

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:06.977
IF THE PERSON SAY IF IT'S A- YOU

02:43:07.043 --> 02:43:09.479
KNOW THEY'RE NOT- J. OLDER

02:43:09.546 --> 02:43:12.749
INCARCERATED THERE. THAT THE

02:43:12.816 --> 02:43:15.519
RETALIATION TO VICTIMS IS REAL

02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:19.956
AND- SOMETIMES THE VICTIM MADE.

02:43:20.023 --> 02:43:21.258
B. WISER ABOUT THEIR

02:43:21.324 --> 02:43:24.528
CIRCUMSTANCE AND SO I JUST I WAS

02:43:24.594 --> 02:43:28.598
REALLY STRUGGLING WITH. WHETHER

02:43:28.665 --> 02:43:32.702
THE REQUIREMENT WHEN IT'S IN

02:43:32.769 --> 02:43:34.471
EFFECT NOT SOMETHING THAT THE

02:43:34.538 --> 02:43:37.407
VICTIM WANTS TO HAVE PUT INTO

02:43:37.474 --> 02:43:40.210
EVIDENCE. IS GOING TO BENEFIT

02:43:40.277 --> 02:43:42.512
THE VICTIMS SAFETY AND THAT'S

02:43:42.579 --> 02:43:44.514
WHAT I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH.

02:43:44.581 --> 02:43:45.916
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS

02:43:45.982 --> 02:43:47.350
EXPLICITLY ADDRESSED IN THE

02:43:47.417 --> 02:43:51.388
PREVIOUS CONVERSATION. IF IT

02:43:51.454 --> 02:43:52.756
WASN'T BUT I THINK PART OF THE

02:43:52.822 --> 02:43:55.325
CHALLENGES THAT- IT'S HARD TO

02:43:55.392 --> 02:43:57.594
GENERALIZE IF I COULD ON THIS

02:43:57.661 --> 02:43:59.362
IT'S- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

02:43:59.429 --> 02:44:04.034
IT'S HARD TO GENERALIZE- I HAVE

02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:09.472
SPOKEN TO VICTIMS WHO- WHO HAVE

02:44:09.539 --> 02:44:12.042
MOVED OUT AND MOVED ON AND DON'T

02:44:12.108 --> 02:44:13.843
WANT TO SHOW UP IN COURT- BUT

02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:15.679
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN HIDING. AND

02:44:15.745 --> 02:44:17.547
SO THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THERE-

02:44:17.614 --> 02:44:21.885
AND- I. OBVIOUSLY HAVE DONE

02:44:21.952 --> 02:44:28.225
BILLS. TO- BECAUSE VICTIMS HAVE

02:44:28.291 --> 02:44:31.261
BEEN KILLED BECAUSE THEY THEY

02:44:31.328 --> 02:44:34.397
WERE NOT ABLE TO GET A WHERE

02:44:34.464 --> 02:44:36.233
THEY GOT AWAY AND- THE-

02:44:36.299 --> 02:44:37.767
PERPETRATOR WAS ABLE TO HUNT

02:44:37.834 --> 02:44:40.003
THEM DOWN AND SO. WHAT WE'RE

02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:41.605
TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE AN

02:44:41.671 --> 02:44:43.907
OPPORTUNITY AND I I'VE I OWE IT

02:44:43.974 --> 02:44:45.742
TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SPEAK

02:44:45.809 --> 02:44:47.143
FOR THIS ISSUE THEMSELVES IS

02:44:47.210 --> 02:44:52.782
SAID- MY PERCEPTION THAT THERE'S

02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:54.851
IT'S A- IT'S A RELATIONSHIP

02:44:54.918 --> 02:44:56.086
BETWEEN THE DA'S OFFICE AND THE

02:44:56.152 --> 02:44:58.688
VICTIMS AS TO EXACTLY HOW TO GET

02:44:58.755 --> 02:45:00.590
THEM OUT OF THE SITUATION AND-

02:45:00.657 --> 02:45:01.858
WHAT KIND OF TESTIMONY THEY CAN

02:45:01.925 --> 02:45:03.660
USE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVE

02:45:03.727 --> 02:45:05.862
THE CASE AGAINST. A PERPETRATOR

02:45:05.929 --> 02:45:08.865
AND SO IT'S NOT CUT AND DRY IN

02:45:08.932 --> 02:45:11.368
TERMS OF WHAT WHAT THEY WILL DO-

02:45:11.434 --> 02:45:12.902
BUT IT'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A

02:45:12.969 --> 02:45:14.404
DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENS AND

02:45:14.471 --> 02:45:19.709
MAYBE MAYBE- I MEAN THIS. IN A

02:45:19.776 --> 02:45:21.578
PERFECT WORLD THE DA WILL ALWAYS

02:45:21.645 --> 02:45:23.246
BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE VICTIM

02:45:23.313 --> 02:45:24.080
FIRST RIGHT AND WOULD CONSIDER

02:45:24.147 --> 02:45:26.182
ALL THAT THE WINNER PERFECT

02:45:26.249 --> 02:45:29.486
WORLD RIGHT. AND HOW. AND JUST

02:45:29.552 --> 02:45:32.489
WORRIED ABOUT. HOW IT COULD END

02:45:32.555 --> 02:45:36.192
UP USE BEING USED GIVEN THAT.

02:45:36.259 --> 02:45:40.864
THE. THE PERSPECTIVE OF FURTHER

02:45:40.930 --> 02:45:43.166
VIOLENCE IS SO COMMON IN THESE

02:45:43.233 --> 02:45:45.902
CASES I THINK THE AND DEATH THE

02:45:45.969 --> 02:45:48.138
I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS HAS

02:45:48.204 --> 02:45:52.175
SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU PROSECUTE.

02:45:52.242 --> 02:45:53.410
AND YOU CAN HOLD PEOPLE

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:55.512
ACCOUNTABLE THAT THE INCIDENTS

02:45:55.578 --> 02:45:58.214
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS REDUCED-

02:45:58.281 --> 02:46:00.650
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL

02:46:00.717 --> 02:46:02.686
IS TRYING TO GET TO IS THAT THE

02:46:02.752 --> 02:46:04.587
MORE THAT WE CAN. PROSECUTE YEAH

02:46:04.654 --> 02:46:06.790
I'M IF YOU END UP IN A GOING TO

02:46:06.856 --> 02:46:08.692
A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IN AN

02:46:08.758 --> 02:46:10.827
EMERGENCY ROOM THEN IT'S

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:15.398
SERIOUS- AND- THE ABILITY TO

02:46:15.465 --> 02:46:17.000
ACTUALLY HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE

02:46:17.067 --> 02:46:18.635
BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT. AND

02:46:18.702 --> 02:46:20.637
THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE

02:46:20.704 --> 02:46:22.839
BILL IS THAT IT ALLOWS- A

02:46:22.906 --> 02:46:27.777
PROSECUTION. AND IT TO HOLD AND

02:46:27.844 --> 02:46:30.480
AN INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABLE UNDER

02:46:30.547 --> 02:46:34.484
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE- THAT ARE

02:46:34.551 --> 02:46:38.321
. PROTECT THE INTEREST OF THE

02:46:38.388 --> 02:46:40.657

THAT THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO USE

02:46:46.696 --> 02:46:48.498

INCIDENT- THAT THAT'S DONE

02:46:53.536 --> 02:46:56.639

COMMENT ABOUT THIS THE SIXTH

02:48:23.927 --> 02:48:25.795
AMENDMENT AS THE COURTS HAVE

02:48:25.862 --> 02:48:28.565
HAVE- HAVE RULED AND APPOINTED

02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:30.366
THAT DAY SAYS SIXTH AMENDMENT

02:48:30.433 --> 02:48:33.002
DOES NOT APPLY TO SPECIFIC

02:48:33.069 --> 02:48:34.971

FOR A- IT IT AT EXCLUDES WHEN

02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:44.380
THE ISSUE HAS. TO DO WITH.

02:48:44.447 --> 02:48:48.084
MEDICAL GIVING INFORMATION FOR

02:49:11.007 --> 02:49:13.743
AND WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE

02:49:13.810 --> 02:49:18.181
CONCERNS THAT- SENATOR- SKINNER

02:49:18.248 --> 02:49:22.185
REYES I AM. I JUST AM TRYING TO

02:49:22.252 --> 02:49:25.288
ALSO FIND THE BALANCE. BETWEEN

02:49:25.355 --> 02:49:26.823
SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND

02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:31.027
PROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS- I

02:49:31.094 --> 02:49:33.162
DON'T WANT TO SPEAK IN GENERAL

02:49:33.229 --> 02:49:35.865
TERMS BUT WE DO KNOW THAT- YOU

02:49:35.932 --> 02:49:42.338
KNOW. D. A.'S- DO M. VICTIMS I

02:49:42.405 --> 02:49:43.573
MEAN VICTIMS ARE PENNED BY A LOT

02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:45.942
OF GROUPS TO KIND OF FURTHER A

02:49:46.009 --> 02:49:49.412
PARTICULAR CASE. AND I'M ALSO

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:51.614
CONCERNED THAT IF THERE WAS THIS

02:49:51.681 --> 02:49:55.718
EXEMPTION THAT WAS ALLOWED. THAT

02:49:55.785 --> 02:49:58.054
DA'S COULD ALSO AND- PEOPLE ARE

02:49:58.121 --> 02:50:00.123
VERY PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE LAW CAN

02:50:00.189 --> 02:50:02.191
BE VERY PERSUASIVE FOR GOOD AND

02:50:02.258 --> 02:50:04.093
FOR IN ALL. BUT I WOULD BE

02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:06.529
CONCERNED THAT THIS EXEMPTION

02:50:06.596 --> 02:50:09.232
WOULD ALLOW D. A.'S TO PERSUADE

02:50:09.299 --> 02:50:15.872
FOLKS- TO ALSO. BE PUT IN THIS

02:50:15.939 --> 02:50:19.042
CATEGORY THAT THEN WOULD ALLOW

02:50:19.108 --> 02:50:21.678
D. A.'S TO USE HERE. RATHER THAN

02:50:21.744 --> 02:50:24.681
HAVING FOLKS BE PRESENT TO SPEAK

02:50:24.747 --> 02:50:27.650
ON ISSUES AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE

02:50:27.717 --> 02:50:30.887
REASONS WHY. PEOPLE RE CAN'T AND

02:50:30.954 --> 02:50:32.822
ARE UNCOOPERATIVE SOMETIMES IT'S

02:50:32.889 --> 02:50:34.324
BECAUSE THEY DO FEAR FOR THEIR

02:50:34.390 --> 02:50:35.792
SAFETY AND SOMETIMES IT'S

02:50:35.858 --> 02:50:37.927
BECAUSE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER

02:50:37.994 --> 02:50:39.062
THINGS YOU KNOW LIKE IT WAS THAT

02:50:39.128 --> 02:50:40.930
MOMENT IN TIME THAT PARTICULAR

02:50:40.997 --> 02:50:42.332
SITUATION OR CIRCUMSTANCE AND

02:50:42.398 --> 02:50:43.967
SOMETHING ELSE GOT RESOLVED

02:50:44.033 --> 02:50:45.568
PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY THAT

02:50:45.635 --> 02:50:46.536
INTERESTED IN HAVING SOMEONE

02:50:46.603 --> 02:50:48.571
SWEPT UP BY THE CARCERAL SYSTEM.

02:50:48.638 --> 02:50:51.374
YOU KNOW NEVER TO LIKE COME OUT

02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:54.877
UNCHANGED AND- TO YOUR POINT THE

02:50:54.944 --> 02:50:57.313
END ITS ROOM IT'S UNFAIR TO MAKE

02:50:57.380 --> 02:50:59.082
GENERALIZATIONS BECAUSE EACH

02:50:59.148 --> 02:51:01.918
CASE IS OFTEN IS UNIQUE AND HAS

02:51:01.985 --> 02:51:03.620
ITS OWN SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES

02:51:03.686 --> 02:51:04.754
WHICH MAKE THESE THINGS

02:51:04.821 --> 02:51:06.789
OFTENTIMES REALLY COMPLICATED.

02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:09.525
SO IM JUST WONDERING. IF THERE

02:51:09.592 --> 02:51:12.729
ARE WAYS TO. IF THERE ARE WAYS

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:16.633
TO PROTECT. FOLKS WHO. REALLY

02:51:16.699 --> 02:51:19.102
ARE SEEKING SOME PROTECTION-

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:21.704
WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING SOMETHING

02:51:21.771 --> 02:51:23.740
THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT

02:51:23.806 --> 02:51:26.075
WHICH IS DUE PROCESS AND HOW ARE

02:51:26.142 --> 02:51:28.111
YOU CARVING SOMETHING OUT IN A

02:51:28.177 --> 02:51:29.045
WAY. THAT STILL HOLDS ALL

02:51:29.112 --> 02:51:31.114
PARTIES ACCOUNTABLE AND I WOULD

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:32.682
BE CONCERNED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:34.350
PROSECUTORS THAT WOULD THEN SEE

02:51:34.417 --> 02:51:36.552
THIS AS A LOOPHOLE. THE KIND OF

02:51:36.619 --> 02:51:42.191
SWEET PEOPLE INTO A CATEGORY.

02:51:42.258 --> 02:51:45.895
NOT HERE- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:51:45.962 --> 02:51:50.800
FAIR THAT IS AND SO- BUT I HEARD

02:51:50.867 --> 02:51:52.702
FROM THE CONSULTANTS THAT IT'S-

02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:54.904
IT'S KIND OF BINARY IN TERMS OF

02:51:54.971 --> 02:51:57.240
WHAT THE BILL IT'S A IT'S EITHER

02:51:57.306 --> 02:51:59.275
THIS OR THE ASSETS NOT. YOU KNOW

02:51:59.342 --> 02:52:00.810
MAYBE UNDER PERJURY OR HAVING

02:52:00.877 --> 02:52:02.211
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE NOTIFIED

02:52:02.278 --> 02:52:05.181
NOTARIZED IT VERIFIED THAT THIS

02:52:05.248 --> 02:52:08.051
IN FACT IS THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF

02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:09.218
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:52:09.285 --> 02:52:15.625
WILLING TO CONSIDER. I MEAN.

02:52:15.692 --> 02:52:17.994
IT'S SIMPLE I MEAN I THINK IT'S

02:52:18.061 --> 02:52:19.495
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ON

02:52:19.562 --> 02:52:21.898
THE RECORD. IN SOME WAY WHEN

02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:23.599
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S

02:52:23.666 --> 02:52:26.769
LIFE EVERYONE'S LIFE. AND I

02:52:26.836 --> 02:52:28.037
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT BALANCES.

02:52:28.104 --> 02:52:31.040
THAT SPEAKS TO THE INTENTION

02:52:31.107 --> 02:52:33.142
BEHIND THE BILL AND THE PEOPLE

02:52:33.209 --> 02:52:38.381
YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT.

02:52:38.448 --> 02:52:40.383
CARRIERS LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT

02:52:40.450 --> 02:52:42.985
YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL IT-

02:52:43.052 --> 02:52:46.656
THE SENATOR SKINNER ASKED IF-

02:52:46.723 --> 02:52:52.428
IF- IF IT WOULD. THAT SHE

02:52:52.495 --> 02:52:53.730
ACTUALLY DIDN'T ASK QUESTIONS

02:52:53.796 --> 02:52:54.697
SHE SAID SHE'D BE MORE

02:52:54.764 --> 02:52:56.399
COMFORTABLE IF IT REQUIRED THE

02:52:56.466 --> 02:52:59.235
APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT IS A

02:52:59.302 --> 02:53:00.636
BETTER WAY TO PUT IT THE CONSENT

02:53:00.703 --> 02:53:04.774
OF THE VICTIM AND- AND I HAVE

02:53:04.841 --> 02:53:07.510
SENT THOUGHTSPOT ABOUT THAT TO

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:09.545
SEE TO SEE WHAT. WHAT I THINK

02:53:09.612 --> 02:53:11.948
RIGHT- AND I DON'T I THINK

02:53:12.014 --> 02:53:14.183
THAT'S FINE I THINK THAT THE

02:53:14.250 --> 02:53:17.820
WHOLE POINT OF IT IS THAT- IS

02:53:17.887 --> 02:53:19.589
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO

02:53:19.655 --> 02:53:22.492
SET UP ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT. AND

IMPOSE A NEW SENTENCE OR CREATE

04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:07.306
A NEW CRIMES. WHAT IT DOES DO IS

04:03:07.372 --> 04:03:08.874
IT AND I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S

04:03:08.941 --> 04:03:11.510
VERY MUCH INTENDED TO CREATE A

04:03:11.576 --> 04:03:15.147

HAD ANYTHING TO. OF OFFENSE AND

04:03:53.385 --> 04:03:55.253
ALL AND THE LAST TIME YOU

04:03:55.320 --> 04:03:56.722
BROUGHT THIS BILL LAST YEAR THE

04:03:56.788 --> 04:03:58.223
YEAR BEFORE I BELIEVE THE

COMMITTEE OFFERED YOU AN

04:03:59.624 --> 04:04:05.564
AMENDMENTS. OF THE BILL I THINK

04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:06.765
WHAT A PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE.

04:04:06.832 --> 04:04:09.267
KEEP THE BILL ON TIME. BUT

04:04:09.334 --> 04:04:10.369
PROVIDE THAT THE- IT WOULD NOT

04:04:10.435 --> 04:04:11.503
BE ABLE TO COMMENCE AVIDIN. AND

04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:12.838
SUBSEQUENT- CRIMINAL PROSECUTION

04:04:12.904 --> 04:04:13.872

WHICH WAS YOUR PROG A- AND I

04:04:15.507 --> 04:04:17.142
BELIEVE IT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE-

04:04:17.209 --> 04:04:19.444
IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE ABILITY.

04:04:19.511 --> 04:04:20.846
TO CHARGE MURDER OR VOLUNTARY

04:04:20.912 --> 04:04:23.115

04:04:28.420 --> 04:04:29.187

04:04:32.190 --> 04:04:32.624

04:04:44.669 --> 04:04:46.872

NOTHING TO DO. WITH FENTANYL OR

CARFENTANIL POISONING AND THAT

04:05:03.422 --> 04:05:09.528
IS VERY CONCERNING- AND THAT IS

04:05:09.594 --> 04:05:10.629

LET'S REMEMBER THAT I MEAN

04:05:41.159 --> 04:05:42.360
FENNEL CERTAINLY IS MUCH

04:05:42.427 --> 04:05:46.164
DIFFERENT THAN THAN COCAINE OR

BEFORE JUDGING BE CHARGED WITH

04:06:14.526 --> 04:06:16.561
DEATH THAT RESULTS FROM THE

04:06:16.628 --> 04:06:18.597

04:06:25.904 --> 04:06:27.572
GOING AFTER SO IN THAT RESPECT I

04:06:27.639 --> 04:06:30.142
DO FEEL. IT'S NARROW IN MY MIND

04:06:30.208 --> 04:06:33.945
CERTAINLY NOT IN YOURS- BUT- YOU

04:06:34.012 --> 04:06:38.150
KNOW THE GOAL IS TO HAVE FEWER

04:06:38.216 --> 04:06:40.986
PEOPLE SELLING THIS DEADLY DRUG

04:06:41.052 --> 04:06:42.754
WHICH AS YOU POINTED OUT NOW WE

04:06:42.821 --> 04:06:44.789
HAVE CARFENTANIL AND WHICH IS

04:06:44.856 --> 04:06:47.125
EVEN STRONGER THAN REGULAR

04:06:47.192 --> 04:06:49.895
FENNEL AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

04:06:49.961 --> 04:06:53.365
UNFORTUNATELY CONTINUE. CHASING

04:06:53.431 --> 04:06:55.767
THE NEXT NEW DRUGS AND- HEROIN

04:06:55.834 --> 04:06:58.737
NOW IT'S- IT IN A LARGE PART

04:06:58.803 --> 04:07:00.639
IT'S NOT JUST THE BIGGER MARKETS

04:07:00.705 --> 04:07:02.340
IT'S A SMALLER MARKETS TO YOU'RE

04:07:02.407 --> 04:07:03.375
NOT GOING TO FIND IT BECAUSE

04:07:03.441 --> 04:07:05.143
THEY REPLACED IT WITH BENHAM

04:07:05.210 --> 04:07:05.777
BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER AND IT'S

04:07:05.844 --> 04:07:08.280
EASIER TO MAKE IN THESE LABS

04:07:08.346 --> 04:07:12.484
AND- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT

04:07:12.551 --> 04:07:14.486
THING IS GOING TO BE BY. IT AND

04:07:14.553 --> 04:07:18.056
DEADLIER. I UNDERSTAND THERE IS

04:07:18.123 --> 04:07:19.925
THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU KNOW

04:07:19.991 --> 04:07:22.294
THERE'S FOR EVERY DRUG DEALER

04:07:22.360 --> 04:07:24.062
THAT YOU TAKE OFF THE STREET

04:07:24.129 --> 04:07:27.232
ANOTHER ONE WILL TAKE HIS OR HER

04:07:27.299 --> 04:07:28.400
PLACE. AND THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE

04:07:28.466 --> 04:07:32.204
HELPER. WHEN THEY GET OUT OF

04:07:32.270 --> 04:07:33.238
PRISON THEY DON'T SPEND THAT

04:07:33.305 --> 04:07:34.639
MUCH TIME IN PRISON LET'S BE

04:07:34.706 --> 04:07:37.008
HONEST RIGHT NOW THAT SAME DRUG

04:07:37.075 --> 04:07:39.644
DEALER IS OUT. BUT SOMEBODY

04:07:39.711 --> 04:07:41.012
REPLACED HIM WHILE HE WAS

04:07:41.079 --> 04:07:43.215
INCARCERATED NOW YOU'VE GOT TO

04:07:43.281 --> 04:07:45.884
ON THE CORNER WE'RE INCREASING

04:07:45.951 --> 04:07:47.118
THE NUMBERS THE GOAL IS TO KEEP

04:07:47.185 --> 04:07:51.256
. HEARINGS HEARINGS LIKE THIS

04:07:51.323 --> 04:07:54.626
FROM HAVING TO TAKE PLACE AGAIN

04:07:54.693 --> 04:07:55.827
FROM HAVING ALL THESE PARENTS

04:07:55.894 --> 04:07:56.795
CAN FOR FROM LISTENING TO

04:07:56.861 --> 04:07:59.464
TESTIMONY SAYING I LOST MY ONLY

04:07:59.531 --> 04:08:01.132
CHILD I LOST MY GRANDSON I MEAN.

04:08:01.199 --> 04:08:02.968
I DON'T THINK. CARCERI OUR WAY

04:08:03.034 --> 04:08:04.369
OUT OF THIS THAT'S NOT MICHAEL

04:08:04.436 --> 04:08:07.272
IT JUST ISN'T. BUT I THINK WE

04:08:07.339 --> 04:08:08.206
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO AT

04:08:08.273 --> 04:08:12.344
LEAST TRY. TO PERSUADE. SOME OF

04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:14.713
THESE FOLKS TO RETHINK THEIR

04:08:14.779 --> 04:08:17.182
LINE OF WORK TO RETHINK WHAT

04:08:17.249 --> 04:08:20.485
THEY'RE DOING- I MEAN WHAT ELSE

04:08:20.552 --> 04:08:22.554
ARE WE GOING TO DO ARE WE GOING

04:08:22.621 --> 04:08:23.822
TO LEGALIZE EVERY DRUG IN JUST

04:08:23.888 --> 04:08:26.091
SAY WELL IF YOU MAKE IT A LEGAL

04:08:26.157 --> 04:08:29.127
THEN. THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER

04:08:29.194 --> 04:08:32.564
EITHER- I HOPE THAT AT LEAST

04:08:32.631 --> 04:08:34.065
THAT TOUCHES ON THE YOU KNOW THE

04:08:34.132 --> 04:08:36.101
POINTS HE MADE LEAST FROM MY

04:08:36.167 --> 04:08:37.669
PERSPECTIVE- I BELIEVE HE IS

04:08:37.736 --> 04:08:40.105
CURRENTLY ON THE LINE OKAY

04:08:40.171 --> 04:08:42.173
MISTER GUILE ARE YOU ON THE ON

04:08:42.240 --> 04:08:44.376
THE TELECONFERENCE LINE. HE I AM

04:08:44.442 --> 04:08:46.544
ON THE LINE CAN YOU HEAR ME.

04:08:46.611 --> 04:08:48.480
PERFECT I CAN HEAR YOU CAN YOU

YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

04:08:53.051 --> 04:08:54.052
QUESTIONS THAT SENATOR WIENER

04:08:54.119 --> 04:08:56.788
HAD FOR YOU. SURE AND I

04:08:56.855 --> 04:08:57.889
APOLOGIZE FOR THE TECHNICAL

04:08:57.956 --> 04:09:01.092
DIFFICULTY- AND ALL OF GET RIGHT

04:09:01.159 --> 04:09:02.961
TO IT CENTER WE KNOW YOU BROUGHT

04:09:03.028 --> 04:09:05.163
UP YOU BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT.

04:09:05.230 --> 04:09:08.433
THE ABILITY OF THE ADVISEMENT TO

04:09:08.500 --> 04:09:10.435
BE USED IN A FUTURE HOMICIDE

04:09:10.502 --> 04:09:12.570
PROSECUTION IS ONE FACTOR THAT

04:09:12.637 --> 04:09:14.506
GOES INTO A DECISION THAT A

04:09:14.572 --> 04:09:15.874
PROSECUTOR WOULD HAVE TO MAKE

04:09:15.940 --> 04:09:17.208
THE LAW OF IMPLIED MALICE HAS

04:09:17.275 --> 04:09:18.576
BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME WE

04:09:18.643 --> 04:09:20.445
HAVEN'T USED IT IN. THE

04:09:20.512 --> 04:09:21.413
SITUATION THAT YOU PRESENTED

04:09:21.479 --> 04:09:22.814
EARLIER WHERE THERE'S A SMALL

04:09:22.881 --> 04:09:25.016
AMOUNT OF COCAINE SOMEONE SELL

04:09:25.083 --> 04:09:27.452
THAT- AND SOMEONE DIED THIS IS

04:09:27.519 --> 04:09:28.787
DIFFERENT FINAL IS CHANGED THE

04:09:28.853 --> 04:09:31.122
LANDSCAPE AND WHAT IT IS US

04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:33.158
REQUIRING. SOMEONE TO HAVE

04:09:33.224 --> 04:09:34.693
SUBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE

04:09:34.759 --> 04:09:36.561
DANGER OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE

04:09:36.628 --> 04:09:37.729
HAVE TO PROVE THAT IN ORDER TO

04:09:37.796 --> 04:09:39.931
CONVICT SOMEONE OF MURDER WITHIN

04:09:39.998 --> 04:09:40.932
ADVISEMENT WITHOUT AN ARGUMENT

04:09:40.999 --> 04:09:44.602
BUT WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SAYS.

04:09:44.669 --> 04:09:45.670
IF YOU SELL DRUGS. YOU'RE ON

04:09:45.737 --> 04:09:48.006
NOTICE NOW THAT THE LANDSCAPE

04:09:48.073 --> 04:09:49.474
HAS CHANGED BUT IF YOU KILL

04:09:49.541 --> 04:09:52.310
SOMEONE AGAIN IF YOU DO THIS AND

04:09:52.377 --> 04:09:53.845
SOMEONE DIES AS A RESULT. THE

04:09:53.912 --> 04:09:55.947
STAKES ARE NOW RAISED AND NOW

04:09:56.014 --> 04:09:57.515
YOU COULD FACE A HOMICIDE CHARGE

04:09:57.582 --> 04:09:59.284
BE THAT SOME SORT OF. CATEGORY

04:09:59.351 --> 04:10:01.252
MANSLAUGHTER OR MURDER SO IN

04:10:01.319 --> 04:10:02.287
THAT SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE

04:10:02.354 --> 04:10:04.422
SELLS DRUGS THERE THEN WHEN THEY

04:10:04.489 --> 04:10:05.824
ARE CONVICTED EITHER AT PLAY OR

04:10:05.890 --> 04:10:07.726
SOMETHING THEY ARE THEN GIVEN

04:10:07.792 --> 04:10:08.660
THE ADVISEMENT THAT SAYS. YEAH

04:10:08.727 --> 04:10:10.428
NOW NO YOU DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE

04:10:10.495 --> 04:10:12.530
BUT NOW YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS

04:10:12.597 --> 04:10:15.333
POSSIBLE IF YOU DO THIS AGAIN.

04:10:15.400 --> 04:10:17.402
AND IF THAT PERSON DOES IT AGAIN

04:10:17.469 --> 04:10:19.404
AND THAT PERSON DIED. NOW THOSE

04:10:19.471 --> 04:10:20.905
STEAKS ARE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE

04:10:20.972 --> 04:10:22.674
ABILITY TO PROSECUTE FOR SOME

04:10:22.741 --> 04:10:24.476
SORT OF HOMICIDE BE A MURDER. OR

04:10:24.542 --> 04:10:26.478
MANSLAUGHTER SO IT DOESN'T MAKE

04:10:26.544 --> 04:10:28.146
IT ANY EASIER IT DOESN'T MAKE IT

04:10:28.213 --> 04:10:30.014
PRESUMPTIVE IT DOESN'T CHANGE A

04:10:30.081 --> 04:10:31.716
DRUG LAW WHAT IT DOES IT SAYS.

04:10:31.783 --> 04:10:33.818
IS WE CAN NOW USE THE FACT THAT

04:10:33.885 --> 04:10:35.987
YOU KNEW AS ONE OF THE PIECES OF

04:10:36.054 --> 04:10:38.089
EVIDENCE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

04:10:38.156 --> 04:10:40.425
SAY YOU KNEW HOW DANGEROUS IT

04:10:40.492 --> 04:10:41.926
WAS. YOU CAN DISREGARD THAT

04:10:41.993 --> 04:10:43.762
DANGER AND YOU DID IT ANYWAY

04:10:43.828 --> 04:10:45.029
BECAUSE THE ESSENCE OF THE

04:10:45.096 --> 04:10:49.200
HOMICIDE IS SORT OF A DEADLY.

04:10:49.267 --> 04:10:50.235
APATHY IT'S A I KNOW IT. THERE

04:10:50.301 --> 04:10:51.903
AM I GONNA DO A ANYWAY. AND

04:10:51.970 --> 04:10:53.505
THAT'S WHAT THIS SEEKS TO DO AND

04:10:53.571 --> 04:10:54.606
FEDERAL HAS CHANGED THE

04:10:54.672 --> 04:10:55.774
LANDSCAPE WE DIDN'T NEED TO DO

04:10:55.840 --> 04:10:57.976
IT BEFORE IN THOSE OTHER TYPES

04:10:58.042 --> 04:10:59.277
OF CASES THAT. THAT YOU WOULD

04:14:58.449 --> 04:15:00.952
EXPERIENCES AND FEELINGS AND

04:15:01.019 --> 04:15:02.186
THEN WHAT WE ARE PUTTING INTO

04:15:02.253 --> 04:15:07.058
LAW. AND THE DIFFICULTY I THINK

04:15:07.125 --> 04:15:08.693
THE THING THAT VARIOUS OF THE

04:15:08.760 --> 04:15:10.828
MEMBERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH

04:15:10.895 --> 04:15:12.697
. IS THAT THE WHAT'S BEING PUT

04:15:12.764 --> 04:15:15.199
BEFORE US. PERHAPS THE LANGUAGE

04:15:15.266 --> 04:15:21.072
STATED. THAT THE DRUG DEATH

04:15:21.139 --> 04:15:22.573
MINUTES IN OTHER WORDS HE

04:15:22.640 --> 04:15:24.575
ADVISEMENT WAS SPECIFIC THAT IT

04:15:24.642 --> 04:15:28.079
WAS A FENTANYL RELATED. I CAN'T

04:15:28.146 --> 04:15:29.881
SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ELSE BUT

04:15:29.947 --> 04:15:32.183
THERE MIGHT BE MORE WILLINGNESS

04:15:32.250 --> 04:15:35.753
. HOWEVER IT DOES NOT YES IT YES

04:15:35.820 --> 04:15:38.156
IT IS TRUE THAT MOST OF THE

04:15:38.222 --> 04:15:40.625
DRUGS LISTED COULD BE. BUT IT

04:15:40.692 --> 04:15:43.327
DOESN'T MAKE THAT. SPECIFIC IT

04:15:43.394 --> 04:15:46.497
DOESN'T MAKE IT THAT IT MUST BE

04:15:46.564 --> 04:15:49.600
. AND SO YOU HAVE AND NOT LOOK

04:15:49.667 --> 04:15:53.104
AT NO WAIT WOOD SHOULD ANY DRUG

04:15:53.171 --> 04:15:54.939
DEATH BE ANY WORSE BETTER OR-

04:15:55.006 --> 04:15:57.642
BUT THERE CAN BE CIRCUMSTANCES

04:15:57.709 --> 04:15:59.277
WHERE ANOTHER DRUG ON THAT LIST

04:15:59.343 --> 04:16:00.945
. LEAD TO SOMEONE'S DEATH HAD

04:16:01.012 --> 04:16:02.413
NOTHING TO DO WITH FEDERAL WAS

04:16:02.480 --> 04:16:04.415
NOT ADULTERATED BUT IT WAS A

04:16:04.482 --> 04:16:05.883
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF THAT

04:16:05.950 --> 04:16:08.519
PERSON FOR EXAMPLE. AND THOSE

04:16:08.586 --> 04:16:11.089
THAT'S WHAT OUR COURT SETTINGS

04:16:11.155 --> 04:16:13.057
ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS

04:16:13.124 --> 04:16:15.493
WHOLE CONTEXT OF ANY. OF ANY

04:16:15.560 --> 04:16:17.795
CRIME THE CHARGES THAT ARE

04:16:17.862 --> 04:16:21.265
BROUGHT. AND IN OUR ENACTING OF

04:16:21.332 --> 04:16:24.035
LAWS WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT

04:16:24.102 --> 04:16:29.273
TO. OVER PRESCRIBE SOMETHING

04:16:29.340 --> 04:16:31.809
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE

04:16:31.876 --> 04:16:36.914
CONTACTS AND SO. IF THIS. BILL

04:16:36.981 --> 04:16:41.219
WERE TO BE A WARNING VERSUS

04:16:41.285 --> 04:16:43.121
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE ALLOWED

04:16:43.187 --> 04:16:45.289
A GUARANTEED EVIDENCE WHEN WE

04:16:45.356 --> 04:16:47.225
CAN PROTECT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF

04:16:47.291 --> 04:16:51.295
THE NEXT CHARGE. SUCH A WARNING

04:16:51.362 --> 04:16:56.200
AS A WAY TO HELP. PUBLIC SAFETY

04:16:56.267 --> 04:16:57.802
AND PROTECT LIVES I COULD

04:16:57.869 --> 04:17:01.739
SUPPORT. FOR POTENTIALLY IF IT

04:17:01.806 --> 04:17:04.342
WERE MODIFIED SWEET REALLY WAS

04:17:04.408 --> 04:17:06.177
SPECIFIC TO FENTANYL OR

04:17:06.244 --> 04:17:08.846
CARFENTANIL. BUT IN ITS

04:17:08.913 --> 04:17:15.686
BROADNESS. IT IS VERY HARD.

04:17:15.753 --> 04:17:18.156
THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER.

04:17:18.222 --> 04:17:21.726
AMERICAN WATER. THANK YOU MADAM

04:17:21.793 --> 04:17:23.494
CHAIR I JUST HAD A QUESTION

04:17:23.561 --> 04:17:26.364
EITHER FOR THE AUTHOR OR FOR THE

04:17:26.430 --> 04:17:30.067
G. A. R. SO CURRENTLY. AND THERE

04:17:30.134 --> 04:17:35.439
HAVE BEEN SOME- EXAMPLES OF THIS

04:17:35.506 --> 04:17:37.508
THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE NEWS BUT

04:17:37.575 --> 04:17:40.311
CURRENTLY THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS

04:17:40.378 --> 04:17:42.446
EITHER DEALERS WHO HAVE BEEN

04:17:42.513 --> 04:17:45.216
SELLING OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

04:17:45.283 --> 04:17:47.418
SHARING DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN

04:17:47.485 --> 04:17:51.722
CHARGED WITH MURDER AND OR

04:17:51.789 --> 04:17:54.258
VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER WHICH I'M

04:17:54.325 --> 04:17:59.130
ASSUMING IS. AND INTENT OF THE

04:17:59.197 --> 04:18:01.699
BILL TO CHARGE PEOPLE AT SOME

04:18:01.766 --> 04:18:07.738
POINT WITH- MURDER AND IN THE

04:18:07.805 --> 04:18:09.640
INSTANCES WHERE THIS HAS

04:18:09.707 --> 04:18:12.210
HAPPENED PEOPLE HAVE DIED. FROM

04:18:12.276 --> 04:18:14.712
TAKING A DRUG THAT WAS LACED

04:18:14.779 --> 04:18:16.547
WITH FENTANYL SO THAT'S

04:18:16.614 --> 04:18:19.116
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. SO MY

04:18:19.183 --> 04:18:23.120
QUESTION IS. IF THAT'S ALREADY

04:18:23.187 --> 04:18:25.890
AVAILABLE TO D. A.'S AND IF IT'S

04:18:25.957 --> 04:18:28.860
ALREADY A TOOL THAT'S BEING USED

04:18:28.926 --> 04:18:33.431
BY D. A.'S. HOW DOES THIS DIFFER

04:18:33.497 --> 04:18:35.233
OR HOW DOES THIS ADD BECAUSE IT

04:18:35.299 --> 04:18:38.269
SEEMS TO ME THAT DA'S ARE

04:18:38.336 --> 04:18:41.772
ACTUALLY. LOOKING AT THE TOOLS

04:18:41.839 --> 04:18:43.708
THAT ARE IN THEIR TOOLBOX V. OF

04:18:43.774 --> 04:18:46.944
THE PENAL CODE AND ARE FIGURING

04:18:47.011 --> 04:18:49.513

. THIS COVERS SOME OPENING THAT

04:19:01.859 --> 04:19:04.195
ISN'T ALREADY AVAILABLE OR IF

04:19:04.262 --> 04:19:06.664
THIS IS AN ADDITIVE IN SO I

04:19:06.731 --> 04:19:08.599
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD

04:19:08.666 --> 04:19:10.301
AND THEN IF MAYBE- YOUR WITNESS

04:19:10.368 --> 04:19:13.404
CAN ALSO SHARE BUT YOU KNOW I'M

04:19:13.471 --> 04:19:14.772

I HAVE TO RESPOND BETTER WE CAN

04:19:43.734 --> 04:19:44.969
DO IT NOW IT'S INCREDIBLY

04:19:45.036 --> 04:19:46.737
DIFFICULT THESE CHARGES REQUIRED

04:19:46.804 --> 04:19:48.506
IF WE WANT TO SEE A MURDER

04:19:48.572 --> 04:19:50.241
CHARGE ON SOMEONE FOR. FOR

04:19:50.308 --> 04:19:52.810
SELLING. THAT ALTERNATELY KILLED

04:19:52.877 --> 04:19:54.445
SOMEONE WE HAVE TO PROVE THEY

04:19:54.512 --> 04:19:55.880
KNEW HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS. AND

04:19:55.947 --> 04:19:57.415
WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH THE

04:19:57.481 --> 04:19:58.683
EVIDENCE OF THE CASE BUT IT

04:19:58.749 --> 04:20:00.751
DOESN'T EXIST IN A LOT OF THESE

04:20:00.818 --> 04:20:01.485
CASES BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY A

04:20:01.552 --> 04:20:02.887
NUMBER OF THE THAT RESULT IN

04:20:02.954 --> 04:20:07.091
CORNERS CASES AND THEY DON'T

04:20:07.158 --> 04:20:08.359
START I'M A SITE INVESTIGATION.

04:20:08.426 --> 04:20:09.794
WE TO BUILD. AND WHETHER.

04:20:09.860 --> 04:20:12.797
SOMEONE WHO CAN'T PROVE BECAUSE

04:20:12.863 --> 04:20:13.597
THE EVIDENCE ISN'T THERE WE

04:20:13.664 --> 04:20:14.932
DON'T HONESTLY THINK THEY DIDN'T

04:20:14.999 --> 04:20:16.400
KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THEIR

04:20:16.467 --> 04:20:18.669
BEHAVIOR WHILE WE DON'T HAVE A

04:20:18.736 --> 04:20:20.871
CASE WHAT THIS DOES IS PUT

04:20:20.938 --> 04:20:24.041
SOMEONE WHO ALREADY. BEEN FOUND

04:20:24.108 --> 04:20:25.943
RISK. I NOTICED THAT IT IS

04:20:26.010 --> 04:20:27.945
DANGEROUS BUT IF YOU SELL MATT

04:20:28.012 --> 04:20:29.680
IF YOU SELL COCAINE IF YOU TAKE

04:20:29.747 --> 04:20:32.984
BILL IF USED ANY. IT LIKELY AND

04:20:33.050 --> 04:20:34.251
VERY DANGEROUS AND YOU COULD

04:20:34.318 --> 04:20:36.220
KILL SOMEONE AND IF YOU DO THAT

04:20:36.287 --> 04:20:38.689
AGAIN THEN WE CAN PROVE IT YOU

04:20:38.756 --> 04:20:41.492
KNOW WHAT BECAUSE YOU DID YOU

04:20:41.559 --> 04:20:44.862
ABILITY TO DO IT IT'S JUST VERY

04:20:44.929 --> 04:20:45.463
DIFFICULT AND SO MANY OF THE

04:20:45.529 --> 04:20:47.631
PEOPLE I CAN TELL BY TODAY THEIR

04:20:47.698 --> 04:20:48.799
CASES HAVE. HAVEN'T COME TO

04:20:48.866 --> 04:20:52.570
FRUITION THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY

04:20:52.636 --> 04:20:54.372
ONE HUNDRED WILL BE GOOD

04:20:54.438 --> 04:20:58.609
ASSEMBLY THERE DURING. OR THIS

04:20:58.676 --> 04:21:00.845
YOUR PARTNER AND SAID NOW YOU

04:21:00.911 --> 04:21:02.580
KNOW THE POINT AS AS CENTER MY

04:21:02.646 --> 04:21:04.348
POINT GOAL IS TO PREVENT THAT IF

04:21:04.415 --> 04:21:06.450
THE SAY YOU KNOW WHAT DANGEROUS

04:21:06.517 --> 04:21:08.753
DON'T DO IT AGAIN IF YOU DO AND

04:21:08.819 --> 04:21:12.189
SOMEONE THAT THE RESULT. ALL YOU

04:21:12.256 --> 04:21:13.257
. AT THAT THAT DEADLY APATHY

04:21:13.324 --> 04:21:15.393
THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO PROSECUTE

04:21:15.459 --> 04:21:18.729
NOT ANYONE WHO JUST SELL DRUGS

04:21:18.796 --> 04:21:20.231
BUT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THAT IT'S

04:21:20.297 --> 04:21:22.700
DANGEROUS. THIS ALL OF YOUR THAT

04:21:22.767 --> 04:21:25.302
DANGER AND OTHER AND THAT'S TRUE

04:21:25.369 --> 04:21:27.571
IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH GUNS IF

04:21:27.638 --> 04:21:29.640
YOU'RE DRUNK BEHIND THE WHEEL

04:21:29.707 --> 04:21:32.043
AND NOW SELLING DROP BECAUSE

04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:35.079
THAT MAKES IT VERY LIKELY BE

04:21:35.146 --> 04:21:36.414
OKAY THAT YOU'RE BUYING OR THE

04:21:36.480 --> 04:21:38.349
PILL THAT YOU'RE BUYING IS GOING

04:21:38.416 --> 04:21:42.386
TO BE SPENT ON THAT. TO BE FAIR

04:21:42.453 --> 04:21:44.455
. IT IT. YEAH THOSE CASES WHERE

04:21:44.522 --> 04:21:46.590
HAVE EVER IT US PROVE THAT NOW

04:21:46.657 --> 04:21:48.559
OR IF WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE HOPE

04:21:48.626 --> 04:21:52.196
THAT SHOWS A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT

04:21:52.263 --> 04:21:53.964
ON ON HOW THAT ADVISEMENT WORK

04:21:54.031 --> 04:21:55.833
IT DOES BUT IT ALSO IT IT M. HAS

04:21:55.900 --> 04:21:57.668
REVEALED ANOTHER QUESTION IF I

04:21:57.735 --> 04:22:01.305
MAY WHICH IS THAT YOU SAID IT

04:22:01.372 --> 04:22:03.007
ADVISEMENT PROVES THAT THEY KNOW

04:22:03.074 --> 04:22:06.210
BUT IT. LET DO SO ADVISORY STAY

04:22:06.277 --> 04:22:07.478
BE PROVIDED THE DEFENDANT

04:22:07.545 --> 04:22:09.080
WRITING YOU'RE A PLEA FORM OR

04:22:09.146 --> 04:22:11.015
AFTER SENTENCING. SO A THAT

04:22:11.082 --> 04:22:14.485
WOULD SUGGEST TO ME. THAT I'M-

04:22:14.552 --> 04:22:15.753
THE FIRST STEP IS NOT JUST

04:22:15.820 --> 04:22:17.588
GETTING AN ADVISEMENT THE FIRST

04:22:17.655 --> 04:22:20.591
STEP IS ACTUALLY A CHARGE- AND

04:22:20.658 --> 04:22:22.426
THOSE AND SORE AND IF YOU WORK

04:22:22.493 --> 04:22:25.029
THAT THROUGH YOU'RE EITHER

04:22:25.096 --> 04:22:27.531
EXCEPT IT PLAYED. THE- OR YOU'VE

04:22:27.598 --> 04:22:29.300
BEEN CHOI. YOU SAY THE VIOLENCE

04:22:29.366 --> 04:22:33.804
WOULD PROVE THAT THEY KNOW- IN I

04:22:33.871 --> 04:22:35.473
WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION TO

04:22:35.539 --> 04:22:37.475
THAT BECAUSE HOW I READ IT YOU

04:22:37.541 --> 04:22:38.909
WOULD GET AN INVITE AND

04:22:38.976 --> 04:22:42.446
ADVISEMENT. AFTER THE FACT. SO

04:22:42.513 --> 04:22:45.182
IS THE ENVIRONMENT VOLUNTARY. I

04:22:45.249 --> 04:22:46.951
MEAN BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE.

04:22:47.017 --> 04:22:50.287
WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW PLEA

04:22:50.354 --> 04:22:52.356
MEANS ACCEPT THE PLEA RIGHT AND

04:22:52.423 --> 04:22:53.691
I CHARGE MEANS YOU'VE BEEN

04:22:53.757 --> 04:22:56.861
CONVICTED- OR SENTENCING MEANS

04:22:56.927 --> 04:22:59.296
THAT THIS PROCESS HAS HAPPENED

04:22:59.363 --> 04:23:01.966
WITH THE COURTS SO CAN YOU OPT

04:23:02.032 --> 04:23:04.635
TO NOT HAVE THE SIZE PUT IN YOUR

04:23:04.702 --> 04:23:09.473
BECAUSE YOU SO ATTACHED ARE YOU

04:23:09.540 --> 04:23:11.208
. I DON'T KNOW EVERYONE WHO'S

04:23:11.275 --> 04:23:13.844
NOTING. IS TO MILLIMETER ANSWER

04:23:13.911 --> 04:23:16.013
WHATEVER EXACTLY WHAT IS IN IT

04:23:16.080 --> 04:23:17.615
SO IS THE BISON BOND HERE YOU

04:23:17.681 --> 04:23:20.584
CAN YOU TO NOT HAVE. BECAUSE YOU

04:23:20.651 --> 04:23:22.386
DON'T NOW OR DOES IT I'M WITH

04:23:22.453 --> 04:23:25.122
YOU IT DOES IT IN THE NEAR FILE

04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:27.825
REGARDLESS. SO THERE ARE THERE

04:23:27.892 --> 04:23:29.260
ARE THERE ARE. CASES WHERE THIS

04:23:29.326 --> 04:23:31.695
IS IT IS RELEVANT TO ON ON

04:23:31.762 --> 04:23:33.831
SOMEONE'S CONVICTION FOR SALE

04:23:33.898 --> 04:23:35.933
THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE THE DEATH

04:23:36.000 --> 04:23:37.034
OF SOMEONE. SOMEONE IS CONVICTED

04:23:37.101 --> 04:23:38.836
FELON BURKE UP THEY EITHER

04:23:38.903 --> 04:23:40.538
PLEASE THE DAUGHTER THEY WERE

04:23:40.604 --> 04:23:41.939
CONVICTED BY A JURY. ULTIMATELY

04:23:42.006 --> 04:23:43.874
AT THE CONCLUSION THAT CASE OF

04:23:43.941 --> 04:23:45.809
ARE FOUND RESPONSIBLE ONE OF

PROSECUTING DRUG DEALERS HAS

04:27:27.097 --> 04:27:28.632
REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY

04:27:28.699 --> 04:27:31.168
AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS IN THE

04:27:31.235 --> 04:27:35.239
OPEN MARKET. SO AND THERE'S A

04:27:35.305 --> 04:27:37.508
STATISTICS ACTUALLY BACKED UP

REPEAT OFFENDERS. SO CLEARLY

04:27:54.925 --> 04:27:56.693
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR CITY IN

04:27:56.760 --> 04:27:58.629
SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT WORKING AND

04:27:58.695 --> 04:28:00.230
IT'S REFLECTED IN THE OVERDOSE

04:28:00.297 --> 04:28:01.799
DEATHS LAST YEAR WE HAD SIX

04:28:01.865 --> 04:28:02.833

FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED TIMES

04:28:20.150 --> 04:28:21.485
STRONGER THAN MORPHINE. WHICH IS

04:28:21.552 --> 04:28:22.886
WAY STRONGER THAN BLACK TAR

04:28:22.953 --> 04:28:25.022

LIKE SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE

04:29:31.021 --> 04:29:36.326
. OKAY I TESTIFIED. SOME.

04:29:36.393 --> 04:29:38.362
NATIONALLY THE DEATH RATE FROM

04:29:38.428 --> 04:29:39.763
THESE DRUGS HAS INCREASED AND

04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:41.198
YOU'VE HEARD THE STATISTICS BUT

04:29:41.265 --> 04:29:43.800
IT IS INCREASED BY ABOUT OVER A

04:29:43.867 --> 04:29:45.869
1000% BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

04:29:45.936 --> 04:29:47.404
ELEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND

04:29:47.471 --> 04:29:48.472

DEATHS HAVE INCREASED IN EVERY

04:29:53.310 --> 04:29:55.212
MAJOR DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP BUT THE

04:29:55.279 --> 04:29:59.483
NOTE BROUGH SEEN BIGGER INCREASE

04:29:59.550 --> 04:30:01.351
IN DEATHSTHAN THE BLACK

04:30:01.418 --> 04:30:06.390
COMMUNITY. AS MORE. SB THIRTEEN

04:30:06.456 --> 04:30:08.125
FIFTY DOES NOT CREATE A DRUG

04:30:08.191 --> 04:30:10.127
INDUCED HOMICIDE CHARGE AS IT

04:30:10.193 --> 04:30:11.762
WAS EXPLAINED BY THE DA AND

04:30:11.828 --> 04:30:13.764
MYSELF THIS IS AN ADMONISHMENT

04:30:13.830 --> 04:30:15.666
IN COURT. SO THAT WE CAN HOLD

04:30:15.732 --> 04:30:17.334
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IT DOES NOT

04:30:17.401 --> 04:30:18.635
MEAN THAT THEY WILL BE CHARGED

04:30:18.702 --> 04:30:20.270
WITH MURDER MEANS THE

04:30:20.337 --> 04:30:21.371
POSSIBILITY IS THERE BUT MOST

04:30:21.438 --> 04:30:24.541
IMPORTANT. IS THAT WE GIVE THE

04:30:24.608 --> 04:30:26.243
ADMONISHMENT AND THAT THEY KNOW

04:30:26.310 --> 04:30:28.712
THAT NO ONE IN FUTURE CAN SAY I

04:30:28.779 --> 04:30:31.014
HAD NO IDEA. THAT FENTANYL THE

04:30:31.081 --> 04:30:33.216
SIZE OF TWO GRAINS OF SALT COULD

04:30:33.283 --> 04:30:35.619
KILL ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. THEY

04:30:35.686 --> 04:30:38.288
CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. THE GOAL

04:30:38.355 --> 04:30:42.259
IS INCREASING. EDUCATION IF YOU

04:30:42.326 --> 04:30:45.262
WILL IT IS NOT ABOUT

04:30:45.329 --> 04:30:48.265
INCARCERATION. THESE DRUGS ARE

04:30:48.332 --> 04:30:50.467
UNFAIRLY TARGETING IMPOVERISHED

04:30:50.534 --> 04:30:52.903
COMMUNITIES ACCORDING TO THE L.

04:30:52.970 --> 04:30:54.938
A. TIMES DRUG OVERDOSES WERE

04:30:55.005 --> 04:30:58.208
RESPONSIBLE FOR JUST UNDER 30%

04:30:58.275 --> 04:31:00.243
OF THE ALL THE DEATHS OF

04:31:00.310 --> 04:31:02.145
HOMELESS IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT

04:31:02.212 --> 04:31:04.114
WAS THE LEADING CAUSE. THIS BILL

04:31:04.181 --> 04:31:05.682
WILL FORCE DRUG DEALERS TO MAKE

04:31:05.749 --> 04:31:08.619
HARD CHOICES AND TO BE AWARE OF

04:31:08.685 --> 04:31:09.886
THE CONSEQUENCES OR BENEFIT TO

04:31:09.953 --> 04:31:11.922
GO ALONG WITH THAT CHOICE LIKE

04:31:11.989 --> 04:31:12.723
ANY OTHER RESPONSIBLE ADULT BUT

04:31:12.789 --> 04:31:14.257
THE UNWILLINGNESS. TO ADDRESS

04:31:14.324 --> 04:31:16.059
THE FINAL EPIDEMIC ON THE CHANCE

04:31:16.126 --> 04:31:17.094
THAT IT WOULD INCREASE

04:31:17.160 --> 04:31:19.830
INCARCERATION LEVELS IGNORES THE

04:31:19.896 --> 04:31:21.898
FACT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE

04:31:21.965 --> 04:31:24.234
DYING FROM IT IF YOU CAN'T SAY

04:31:24.301 --> 04:31:25.902
IT'S GOING TO INCREASE. THE

04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:29.306
NUMBER OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE

04:31:29.373 --> 04:31:29.906
WHO ARE INCARCERATED WITHOUT

04:31:29.973 --> 04:31:32.643
ALSO. THANK NUMBER BLACK BROWN

04:31:32.709 --> 04:31:33.877
PEOPLE WERE DYING FROM THIS DRUG

04:31:33.944 --> 04:31:36.380
ARE INCREASING AS WELL MORE SO

04:31:36.446 --> 04:31:39.016
THAN THOSE- BEING INCARCERATED

04:31:39.082 --> 04:31:41.318
FOR SELLING THESE DRUGS. THIS IS

04:31:41.385 --> 04:31:46.757
NOT A RACIAL ISSUE- I WANT TO

04:31:46.823 --> 04:31:48.458
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE-

04:31:48.525 --> 04:31:51.528
ARGUMENTS THAT THE OPPOSITION-

04:31:51.595 --> 04:31:54.831
MADE THOUGH I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME

04:31:54.898 --> 04:31:57.534
OF THOSE ALREADY BUT I WILL SAY

04:31:57.601 --> 04:32:00.504
THAT- LET'S SEE THEY SAID. THE

04:32:00.570 --> 04:32:02.139
STATE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO

04:32:02.205 --> 04:32:03.840
SPEND FUNDING ON INCREASING

04:32:03.907 --> 04:32:05.475
INCARCERATION LEVELS THAT WE

04:32:05.542 --> 04:32:06.977
SHOULD FOCUS ON EVIDENCE BASED

04:32:07.044 --> 04:32:11.815
PRACTICES OKAY WELL IN NINETEEN

04:32:11.882 --> 04:32:13.717
EIGHTY BEFORE WE ENACTED

04:32:13.784 --> 04:32:14.951
STRICTER DRUNK DRIVING LAWS WE

04:32:15.018 --> 04:32:15.819
HAD ABOUT TWENTY FIVE.

04:32:15.886 --> 04:32:18.989
CALIFORNIA IN THAT YEAR WHO WERE

04:32:19.056 --> 04:32:21.324
KILLED IN DRUNK DRIVING FAST

PLACE FOR D. WISE THAT NUMBER

04:32:26.430 --> 04:32:30.200
WAS CUT IN HALF. SB THIRTEEN

04:32:30.267 --> 04:32:32.069
FIFTIES A WARNING FROM THE COURT

04:32:32.135 --> 04:32:33.136
ENSURING THAT A CONVICTED

04:32:33.203 --> 04:32:34.571
INDIVIDUALS EDUCATE ON THE

04:32:34.638 --> 04:32:36.440
DANGERS OF DEALING LESS HOT

04:32:36.506 --> 04:32:39.342
FENNEL SAME AS WE DID FOR DRUNK

04:32:39.409 --> 04:32:42.079
DRIVING. THE OPPOSITION ALSO

04:32:42.145 --> 04:32:44.014
SAID THAT A CONVICTED DEALER

04:32:44.081 --> 04:32:45.849
FACE MURDER CHARGERS CHARGES CAN

04:32:45.916 --> 04:32:48.051
ARGUE THAT INDIVIDUAL CHOSE TO

CONSUME. TOO MUCH HEROIN OR

04:32:51.788 --> 04:32:54.224
WHATEVER THE DRUG WAS- IT IS

04:32:54.291 --> 04:32:57.160
UNLIKELY THAT SOMEONE THE VERY

FIRST TIME THE USE HEROIN. IS

04:33:00.664 --> 04:33:03.667
GOING TO DIE FROM IT IT IS. VERY

04:33:03.734 --> 04:33:05.202
LIKELY THAT SOMEONE WHO TAKES

SPENT NO FROM THE FIRST TIME IN

04:33:06.937 --> 04:33:08.472

04:33:11.708 --> 04:33:15.078

DISCUSSION BUT I THINK IT'S A

04:35:30.680 --> 04:35:33.049
UNFAIR CHARACTERISTIC TO

04:35:33.116 --> 04:35:35.552
INDICATE THAT THERE'S NO

04:35:35.619 --> 04:35:37.621
WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THIS

04:35:37.687 --> 04:35:42.859
ISSUE AND SETTING. THIS IF WE

04:35:42.926 --> 04:35:44.861

04:35:44.928 --> 04:35:46.496

QUIBBLING OF TWO GRAINS OF SALT

THAT'S NOT WHAT IS BEFORE US AND

04:36:17.027 --> 04:36:19.763
SO I JUST THINK IT'S FAIR TO PUT

04:36:19.829 --> 04:36:21.965
ON THE RECORD AS MUCH AS YOU PUT

04:36:22.032 --> 04:36:23.833

LOST WAS A VERY. DEAR FRIEND OF

06:08:53.978 --> 06:08:58.049
MY SON'S. SOMETHING HAS TO BE

06:08:58.115 --> 06:09:02.086
DONE HERE AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY

06:09:02.153 --> 06:09:05.656
I WATCHED ON. THE WAYS IN WHICH

06:09:05.723 --> 06:09:08.726
THE VAGUENESS OF THIS LAW.

06:09:08.793 --> 06:09:12.263
BENEFITS DEFENDANTS ALL THE TIME

06:09:12.330 --> 06:09:15.867
. IN THIS CASE I SAT AND WATCHED

06:09:15.933 --> 06:09:18.970
AS THE PROSECUTORS STRUGGLED

06:09:19.036 --> 06:09:20.838
DISABLED HOW DID HOW DID THESE

06:09:20.905 --> 06:09:23.841
FAX FIFTY GREATER PUNISHMENT HOW

06:09:23.908 --> 06:09:26.677
DO WE DO SOMETHING THE PERSON IN

06:09:26.744 --> 06:09:29.914
THIS CASE WAS GIVEN ONE YEAR OF

06:09:29.981 --> 06:09:32.550
PROBATION. AND IN THAT ONE YEAR

06:09:32.617 --> 06:09:34.919
OF PROBATION THERE ISN'T EVEN

06:09:34.986 --> 06:09:37.455
ENOUGH TIME. TO PAY BACK THE

06:09:37.522 --> 06:09:41.092
EXPENSES THAT THEY HAD FOR THEIR

06:09:41.158 --> 06:09:43.861
SON'S FUNERAL. PROSECUTORS NEED

06:09:43.928 --> 06:09:47.732
GUIDANCE AND IF YOU DIRECT THEM

06:09:47.798 --> 06:09:51.269
TO THINGS LIKE DRIVING OVER A

06:09:51.335 --> 06:09:53.738
HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR RECKLESS

06:09:53.804 --> 06:09:57.408
DRIVING. THOSE THINGS ASSIST THE

06:09:57.475 --> 06:10:01.145
SYSTEM. IN REALLY TARGETING

06:10:01.212 --> 06:10:02.847
THESE THESE ARE JUST MINOR

06:10:02.914 --> 06:10:04.782
VIOLATORS THESE ARE PEOPLE

06:10:04.849 --> 06:10:07.151
ESPECIALLY IN THEIR CASE THIS IS

06:10:07.218 --> 06:10:10.321
A CASE WHERE NINE MONTHS BEFORE

06:10:10.388 --> 06:10:13.858
THIS AND WAS DROPPED ON NINETY

06:10:13.925 --> 06:10:16.494
UP SURFACED. SURFACE STREET

06:10:16.561 --> 06:10:20.798
MIDDLE OF THE DAY. SO I

06:10:20.865 --> 06:10:26.437
UNDERSTAND WHY THE. WHERE THERE

06:10:26.504 --> 06:10:28.673
IS AN OBVIOUS SPEED LIMIT THAT'S

06:10:28.739 --> 06:10:32.443
AGAINST THE LAW. IT IS IT IS BUT

06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:35.346
FOR SENATE AND- BUT I DO THINK

06:10:35.413 --> 06:10:36.847
IF YOU CAN DIRECT. A

06:10:36.914 --> 06:10:39.750
PROSECUTOR'S ATTENTION OR A

06:10:39.817 --> 06:10:41.552
JUDGE'S ATTENTION TO CERTAIN

06:10:41.619 --> 06:10:42.887
WORDS IN ACCORD BECAUSE RIGHT

06:10:42.954 --> 06:10:45.056
NOW IT'S JUST TOO BIG. AND IT

06:10:45.122 --> 06:10:47.525
WILL HELP THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

06:10:47.592 --> 06:10:50.294
PROSECUTE THOSE WHO REALLY NEED

06:10:50.361 --> 06:10:53.230
TO BE MORE SERIOUSLY PROSECUTED

06:10:53.297 --> 06:10:56.233
THEN JUST A YEAR OF PROBATION

06:10:56.300 --> 06:10:58.102
ESTIMATE THERE NO DETAILED I'M

06:10:58.169 --> 06:11:09.213
SOME COMMUNITY SERVICE. I YOUR-

06:11:09.280 --> 06:11:12.116
SO I'M GONNA STOP TALKING I'M A

06:11:12.183 --> 06:11:13.718
YEAH BECAUSE I DO I HEAR WHAT

06:11:13.784 --> 06:11:15.686
YOU'RE SAYING AND I'M TRYING TO

06:11:15.753 --> 06:11:16.253
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHAT

06:11:16.320 --> 06:11:17.955
HAPPENED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE

06:11:18.022 --> 06:11:20.024
AND WHAT LAW BECAUSE LAWS NOT

06:11:20.091 --> 06:11:20.891
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS

06:11:20.958 --> 06:11:22.893
PARTICULAR CASE IT'S ABOUT ON A

06:11:22.960 --> 06:11:24.428
GO BOARD AND HOW YOU'RE

06:11:24.495 --> 06:11:26.597
IMPACTING A SYSTEM AND SO THE

06:11:26.664 --> 06:11:29.066
QUESTION WAS. IT SEEMS TO ME.

06:11:29.133 --> 06:11:31.102
THERE ARE ALREADY TOOLS IN THE

06:11:31.168 --> 06:11:33.871
PENAL CODE TOOL KIT TO ALLOW

06:11:33.938 --> 06:11:37.341
FOR. AT INSTANCES WHERE THERE

06:11:37.408 --> 06:11:40.244
ARE A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES-

06:11:40.311 --> 06:11:42.346
THAT. PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED TO

06:11:42.413 --> 06:11:44.615
SOMEONE'S DEATH- THAT THERE ARE

06:11:44.682 --> 06:11:46.484
TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT THAT CAN

06:11:46.550 --> 06:11:48.586
BE USED AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THE

06:11:48.653 --> 06:11:50.254
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAPPENED WITH

06:11:50.321 --> 06:11:52.156
THIS PARTICULAR CASE I CAN'T.

06:11:52.223 --> 06:11:54.425
WHY THE PERSON DO WE GET

06:11:54.492 --> 06:11:57.161
PATIENTS BERMAN HERE. I'M EITHER

06:11:57.228 --> 06:12:00.931
NO WAY YOU CAN. I IN A PLAN

06:12:00.998 --> 06:12:03.434
CLEAN TIME AND THE DEATH OF

06:12:03.501 --> 06:12:05.536
SOMEONE WHO WILL NEVER COME BACK

06:12:05.603 --> 06:12:08.906
I MEAN WE EVEN WE EVEN WANT TO

06:12:08.973 --> 06:12:11.709
DO THAT A LOT IT RIGHT- SO I'M

06:12:11.776 --> 06:12:13.611
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. OFTENTIMES

06:12:13.678 --> 06:12:15.112
WHEN THEY'RE BILLS IT'S ABOUT

06:12:15.179 --> 06:12:17.548
TRYING TO FIX SOMETHING THAT

YOU'RE DRIVING OVER THE SPEED

06:12:29.960 --> 06:12:33.431
LIMIT. IF YOU. KILL SOMEONE. IF

IN MANY RESPECTS THE PIAA IS

06:21:18.755 --> 06:21:20.724
ALREADY DOING LKS. THE CLOSER

06:21:20.791 --> 06:21:22.526

KNOW. PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES

06:28:47.637 --> 06:28:51.107
WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE A

06:28:51.174 --> 06:28:52.075
SERVICE THAT WAS A JOB TRAINING

06:28:52.142 --> 06:28:56.012
PROGRAM FOR. HOWEVER I HAVE A

06:28:56.079 --> 06:28:57.547
LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE JOB

TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE PA

06:28:58.915 --> 06:29:01.751
RUNS. AND I DON'T THINK WE

06:29:01.818 --> 06:29:04.721
COMPENSATE OUR INCARCERATED

06:29:04.788 --> 06:29:07.057
INDIVIDUALS ADEQUATELY AND I

06:29:07.123 --> 06:29:08.825
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OR WHO MIGHT

06:29:08.892 --> 06:29:10.460
HAVE BEEN IN THIS PROGRAM EVER

06:29:10.527 --> 06:29:12.996
GOT A JOB WITH ANY TYPE OF UP TO

06:29:13.063 --> 06:29:15.665
CURRENT COMPANY- NOW I'M TAKING

06:29:15.732 --> 06:29:18.868
IT SOMEWHAT FACE VALUE. THAT THE

06:29:18.935 --> 06:29:22.105
QUALITY IS LOW AND PERHAPS IT IS

06:29:22.172 --> 06:29:25.775
NOT. AND I DON'T I DON'T KNOW

06:29:25.842 --> 06:29:28.645
IF- I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN I READ

06:29:28.712 --> 06:29:31.748
THE ANALYSIS IF THERE WAS ANY-

06:29:31.815 --> 06:29:34.718
DOCUMENTING TO WHETHER TO BALLOT

06:29:34.784 --> 06:29:36.686
. HELLO EIGHT THIS IN FOR THAT

06:29:36.753 --> 06:29:38.722
THE QUALITY OF THE GLASS IS

06:29:38.788 --> 06:29:41.624
BEING PRODUCED BY IN THE PA

06:29:41.691 --> 06:29:44.761
SYSTEM OR IS LOW. WE ARE TO KNOW

06:29:44.828 --> 06:29:50.900
THAT OKAY SO- SO THEY'RE KIND OF

06:29:50.967 --> 06:29:57.373
SEPARATE ISSUES. AND- I'M

06:29:57.440 --> 06:29:59.876
PERSONALLY WHERE THERE'S OTHER

06:29:59.943 --> 06:30:01.678
PROBLEMS WHETHER THIS QUALITY

06:30:01.745 --> 06:30:03.646
ISSUES THEY ARE NOT BUT THERE

06:30:03.713 --> 06:30:04.748
ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE

06:30:04.814 --> 06:30:07.417
SYSTEM AND I CERTAINLY DON'T

06:30:07.484 --> 06:30:10.186
WANT TO HAVE. THE SB A SITUATION

06:30:10.253 --> 06:30:13.089
WERE USING OUR MEDIC CAL DOLLARS

06:30:13.156 --> 06:30:14.257
TO PROVIDE. YOU KNOW LOWER

06:30:14.324 --> 06:30:17.227
QUALITY PRODUCTS SO IT'S I'M IN

06:30:17.293 --> 06:30:22.132
A CONUNDRUM ON. THE COMPETITION

06:30:22.198 --> 06:30:25.068
IS GOOD AND I CERTAINLY SEE THE

06:30:25.135 --> 06:30:28.838
PIAA AS A MONOPOLY OF SORTS AND

06:30:28.905 --> 06:30:31.641
I HAVE HEARD NOT ABOUT. I WHERE

06:30:31.708 --> 06:30:34.144
BUT FOR THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW

06:30:34.210 --> 06:30:36.346
WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR AND BRAS THE

06:30:36.412 --> 06:30:38.148
QUALITY IS REALLY POOR- YOU CAN

06:30:38.214 --> 06:30:40.016
WEAR THEM ONE OR TWO TIMES AND

06:30:40.083 --> 06:30:41.618
THEN THERE'S NO A LASTING AGAIN

06:30:41.684 --> 06:30:44.020
IT IT TAKES A LONG TIME IF YOU

06:30:44.087 --> 06:30:48.224
ASK FOR ANOTHER PAIR. I'M FOR IT

06:30:48.291 --> 06:30:50.627
TO COME- THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS-

06:30:50.693 --> 06:30:52.562
IT'S CLEAR THAT ARE INCARCERATED

06:30:52.629 --> 06:30:54.564
AND I GET THAT THIS IS NOT. SO I

06:30:54.631 --> 06:30:56.366
MEAN AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY ALSO

06:30:56.432 --> 06:30:58.568
BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO AN AUDIT

06:30:58.635 --> 06:30:59.836
ON PA BECAUSE I CERTAINLY THINK

06:30:59.903 --> 06:31:02.705
THAT IF YOU HAVE A- CLIENTELE.

06:31:02.772 --> 06:31:05.208
THAT ISN'T VALUED THEN YOU MAY

06:31:05.275 --> 06:31:07.343
FEEL INCLINED TO PRODUCE

06:31:07.410 --> 06:31:09.879
PRODUCTS OF LESSER QUALITY. AND

06:31:09.946 --> 06:31:11.781
MAYBE I HAVE A BIAS FOR EYEWEAR

06:31:11.848 --> 06:31:15.151
BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE- SO THEN

06:31:15.218 --> 06:31:18.555
THERE'S THAT TOO. THE OTHER COME

06:31:18.621 --> 06:31:24.460

06:31:24.527 --> 06:31:26.763
TORN BETWEEN THIS BECAUSE- I GET

06:31:26.830 --> 06:31:28.531
WE'RE TRYING TO GO AND IT'S

06:31:28.598 --> 06:31:30.033
CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE QUALITY

06:31:30.099 --> 06:31:32.936

WILLING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AND

06:33:04.427 --> 06:33:07.163

ON A LOCAL A TECHNICALITY A POOL

07:00:18.126 --> 07:00:21.696

ARBITRATION- IN GENERAL. NOW

07:00:38.179 --> 07:00:40.315

AND THE HORROR OF THE PUBLIC- TO

07:01:09.811 --> 07:01:13.648
THAT. WHEN THE PUBLIC THINKS

07:01:13.715 --> 07:01:16.651
THAT THERE ARE DIRTY COPS. IN

THE QUICKEST IN THE FASTEST. AND

07:26:32.832 --> 07:26:34.267
THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN

07:26:34.334 --> 07:26:36.603
INDIVIDUALS HAVE GIVEN CONSENT.

07:26:36.669 --> 07:26:38.304
FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS IN ORDER

07:26:38.371 --> 07:26:40.640
TO ACCESS EMPLOYMENT- FOR MYSELF

07:26:40.707 --> 07:26:42.408
I WOULD DO A BACKGROUND CHECK

07:26:42.475 --> 07:26:43.710
EVEN THOUGH I DID TWENTY FOUR

07:26:43.776 --> 07:26:45.745
YEARS IN A CALIFORNIA PRISON AT

07:26:45.812 --> 07:26:46.813
CHECKER AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT

07:26:46.880 --> 07:26:49.048
I WORK FOR- AND THAT WAS AN

07:26:49.115 --> 07:26:49.716
IMPORTANT STEP. IN ORDER FOR ME

07:26:49.782 --> 07:26:51.985
TO GET TO THE H. R. PROCESS TALK

07:26:52.051 --> 07:26:53.553
ABOUT. SOME OF THE MISTAKES THAT

07:26:53.620 --> 07:26:56.022
I'VE MADE IN MY LIFE AND MOVE ON

07:26:56.089 --> 07:26:56.823
TO THE NEXT TO DECORATE- A THAT

07:26:56.890 --> 07:26:59.192
LEVEL WEIGHT AND I'VE BEEN ABLE

07:26:59.259 --> 07:27:00.193
TO ACCESS- I WOULD EXPRESS MY

07:27:00.260 --> 07:27:01.895
SUPPORT THERE I ALSO UNDERSTAND

07:27:01.961 --> 07:27:04.330
THAT. SOME OP POSITION THE COURT

07:27:04.397 --> 07:27:05.832
BACKGROUND CHECK- I WOULD JUST

07:27:05.899 --> 07:27:08.635
SAY AS MUCH AS I LOVE I'M A PROP

07:27:08.701 --> 07:27:14.507
REVOLVES ARE NONE. DO LEGALS.

07:27:14.574 --> 07:27:15.875
AND I THINK THAT THE APPROACH

07:27:15.942 --> 07:27:17.577
ABOUT PRIVACY GOOD ONE- BUT I

07:27:17.644 --> 07:27:19.646
ALSO THINK THAT ONCE THOSE OF US

07:27:19.712 --> 07:27:20.947
WHO'VE BEEN IMPACTED GIVE THAT

07:27:21.014 --> 07:27:22.382
PERMISSION TO COMPANIES TO

07:27:22.448 --> 07:27:23.416
ACCESS OUR OWN PERSONAL

07:27:23.483 --> 07:27:25.552
INFORMATION WHICH IS YOU KNOW

07:27:25.618 --> 07:27:27.820
IT'S A PUBLIC RECORD AT THAT

07:27:27.887 --> 07:27:29.789
POINT- THAT WE SHOULD BUT ALLOW

07:27:29.856 --> 07:27:32.725
YOU TO ACCESS OUR INFORMATION AN

07:27:32.792 --> 07:27:33.760
EXPEDIENT MANNER SO THAT WAY

07:27:33.826 --> 07:27:34.794
DOESN'T DELAY THE HIRING PROCESS

07:27:34.861 --> 07:27:37.297
SOMETIMES CAN TAKE TWO THREE

07:27:37.363 --> 07:27:38.398

07:27:39.799 --> 07:27:41.901
LOT BETTER BUT THERE'S ON THE

07:27:41.968 --> 07:27:43.770
COUNTER A LOT SLOWER- AND SO IT

07:27:43.836 --> 07:27:44.871
ACTUALLY DOES HAMPER US FROM

07:27:44.938 --> 07:27:46.573

07:27:46.639 --> 07:27:47.907

TO- SB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE A

07:55:55.994 --> 07:55:56.928
MEASURE THAT WOULD ENDANGER OUR

07:55:56.995 --> 07:55:58.062
SCHOOLS. TEACHERS RESOURCE

07:55:58.129 --> 07:55:59.097
OFFICERS AND ESPECIALLY THE

07:55:59.163 --> 07:56:00.999
STUDENTS. THIS ILL CONCEIVED

07:56:01.065 --> 07:56:02.834
BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO

07:56:02.901 --> 07:56:05.536
ENTER SCHOOL GROUNDS TO HARM

07:56:05.603 --> 07:56:06.871
OTHERS. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES

07:56:06.938 --> 07:56:07.839
THAT ANY PERSON WHO WILLFULLY

07:56:07.906 --> 07:56:09.841
THE SERBS WILL SKIP OVER THAT

07:56:09.908 --> 07:56:11.576
PART I THINK IT WAS TAKEN CARE

07:56:11.643 --> 07:56:12.644
OF IN THE AMENDMENTS MY

07:56:12.710 --> 07:56:16.848
APOLOGIES- I. THINK THE MOST

07:56:16.915 --> 07:56:19.817
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS THAT.

07:56:19.884 --> 07:56:21.753
THE GOAL OF THE SCHOOL RESOURCE

07:56:21.819 --> 07:56:23.488
OFFICERS TO PROTECT THE KIDS.

07:56:23.554 --> 07:56:26.457
AND THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT MUCH

07:56:26.524 --> 07:56:27.892
MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE- MANDATED

07:56:27.959 --> 07:56:29.694
REPORTERS WILL NO LONGER BE

07:56:29.761 --> 07:56:31.596
MANDATED TO REPORT TO THEM FOR

07:56:31.663 --> 07:56:34.065
MANY OF THESE CRIMES- THAT ARE

07:56:34.132 --> 07:56:35.400
OCCURRING ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES

07:56:35.466 --> 07:56:37.302
INCLUDING BRINGING. A DEADLY

07:56:37.368 --> 07:56:39.938
WEAPONS ON CAMPUS- ASIDE FROM

07:56:40.004 --> 07:56:41.572
FIREARMS. THERE'S SOME OTHER

07:56:41.639 --> 07:56:43.541
THINGS- THAT THIS BILL WOULD

07:56:43.608 --> 07:56:45.710
ALSO NO LONGER REQUIRE THESE

07:56:45.777 --> 07:56:48.112
MANDATE REPORTERS PROVIDE-

07:56:48.179 --> 07:56:50.448
CONTACT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- SO

07:56:50.515 --> 07:56:51.849
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

07:56:51.916 --> 07:56:53.851
ALSO I KNOW THAT THE ADVOCATES

07:56:53.918 --> 07:56:56.387
HAVE. A MENTION THAT WHILE

07:56:56.454 --> 07:56:58.389
THEY'RE STILL ALLOWED TO REPORT

07:56:58.456 --> 07:57:00.091
OR JUST NOT MANDATED TO REPORT

07:57:00.158 --> 07:57:01.459
HOWEVER THERE'S SECTION THE BILL

07:57:01.526 --> 07:57:04.028
THAT STRIPS THE CIVIL IMMUNITY

07:57:04.095 --> 07:57:04.996
PROTECTIONS FROM THESE

07:57:05.063 --> 07:57:06.731
REPORTERS. AND SO THAT'S A

07:57:06.798 --> 07:57:08.933
CONCERN FOR US BECAUSE NOW

07:57:09.000 --> 07:57:11.569
PEOPLE WHO MAY REPORT AND GET IT

07:57:11.636 --> 07:57:14.172
TO INCORRECT- WILL BE SOLELY

07:57:14.238 --> 07:57:17.475

PROTECTIONS UNDER THE MANDATED

07:57:19.844 --> 07:57:22.180
REPORTER LAWS SO FOR THOSE AND

07:57:22.246 --> 07:57:26.317
MANY OTHER REASONS THAT I WON'T

MOVE IT- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S

07:58:58.810 --> 07:59:00.211
JUST IMPORTANT TO SAY. THAT NOT

07:59:00.278 --> 07:59:02.647
EVERY SOLUTION. NEEDS TO INVOLVE

07:59:02.713 --> 07:59:04.582
LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK YOU

07:59:04.649 --> 07:59:06.884
KNOW. SCHOOL SETTINGS ARE ABOUT

07:59:06.951 --> 07:59:09.787
LEARNING. AND THERE ARE SO MANY

07:59:09.854 --> 07:59:13.157
WAYS. THAT ADULTS ARE INTERESTED

07:59:13.224 --> 07:59:18.262
IN- INNOVATIVELY CREATIVELY.

07:59:18.329 --> 07:59:21.065
COLLABORATIVELY FINDING WAYS TO

07:59:21.132 --> 07:59:24.435
ENSURE THAT RESPECT. AN ORDER

07:59:24.502 --> 07:59:25.837
ARE HAPPENING IN SCHOOL

07:59:25.903 --> 07:59:29.240
SETTINGS. I MEAN WE JUST HAD A

07:59:29.307 --> 07:59:30.541
SITUATION HERE WHERE PEOPLE WERE

07:59:30.608 --> 07:59:32.910
UNHAPPY WITH A VOTE. AND THEY

07:59:32.977 --> 07:59:35.379
SCREAMED OBSCENITIES. INCREDIBLY

07:59:35.446 --> 07:59:37.715
DISRUPTIVE. NO ONE THOUGHT TO

07:59:37.782 --> 07:59:40.017
CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO SETTLE

07:59:40.084 --> 07:59:44.255
THAT. AND SO I THINK THE OLD.

07:59:44.322 --> 07:59:47.291
MORE OFTEN THAT WE DECIDE THAT

07:59:47.358 --> 07:59:49.794
EVERY PROBLEM DESERVE SOMETHING

07:59:49.861 --> 07:59:53.631
IN THE PENAL CODE. THE GREATER

07:59:53.698 --> 07:59:56.334
WE SET OURSELVES UP FOR FAILURE

07:59:56.400 --> 07:59:57.902
. AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

07:59:57.969 --> 08:00:00.705
OTHER WAYS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS TO

08:00:00.771 --> 08:00:03.341
RESOLVE CONFLICT TO ASK FOR

08:00:03.407 --> 08:00:05.343
ENGAGEMENT IN SO MANY SCHOOLS

08:00:05.409 --> 08:00:08.846
PARENTS VOLUNTEERS ALUMNI ARE

08:00:08.913 --> 08:00:11.349
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN MAKING SURE

08:00:11.415 --> 08:00:13.084
THAT SCHOOL SETTINGS. HAVE THE

08:00:13.151 --> 08:00:15.153
KIND OF CULTURE THAT PROMOTES

08:00:15.219 --> 08:00:19.023
BOTH CIVIL DISCOURSE. YOU KNOW

08:00:19.090 --> 08:00:21.058
AS WELL AS LEARNING AND OTHER

08:00:21.125 --> 08:00:23.261
FORMS OF ENGAGEMENT SO IT

08:00:23.327 --> 08:00:26.397
BECOMES TIRESOME TO THINK THAT

08:00:26.464 --> 08:00:29.233
EVERY ANSWER HAS TO BE AN

08:00:29.300 --> 08:00:31.969
ADDITIVE TO THE PENAL CODE LAW

08:00:32.036 --> 08:00:33.838
ENFORCEMENT DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE

08:00:33.905 --> 08:00:36.040
TO BE THE SOLUTION TO EVERY

08:00:36.107 --> 08:00:38.776
SINGLE THING. AND WE HAVE TO

08:00:38.843 --> 08:00:40.845
COME UP WE HAVE TO AT SOME POINT

08:00:40.912 --> 08:00:42.346
IN KNOWLEDGE THAT THE HUMAN

08:00:42.413 --> 08:00:47.151
CONDITION INVOLVES TENSION. AND

08:00:47.218 --> 08:00:49.887
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT VIOLENTLY

08:00:49.954 --> 08:00:51.455
ATTACKING SOMEONE OR DOING

08:00:51.522 --> 08:00:53.457
SOMETHING ILLEGAL SOMETIMES

08:00:53.524 --> 08:00:56.928
TENSION IS OKAY. AND SORT OF A

08:00:56.994 --> 08:01:00.665
PRESSING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH

08:01:00.731 --> 08:01:04.068
THIS NOTION THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:18:25.775 --> 08:18:26.710
INCARCERATED PEOPLE'S TIME IN

08:18:26.776 --> 08:18:31.881
PRISON- AND SO IT ACTUALLY COSTS

08:18:31.948 --> 08:18:33.617
. FOLKS WHO ARE IN PRISON TO BE

08:18:33.683 --> 08:18:36.286
IMPRISONED AND IT COSTS THEIR

08:18:36.353 --> 08:18:40.056
VILLAGE- IT COSTS ARE VILLAGE

08:18:40.123 --> 08:18:42.392
FOR SOMEONE TO BE IN PRISON AND

08:18:42.459 --> 08:18:45.295
SO I YOU KNOW I PEOPLE I HAD

08:18:45.362 --> 08:18:47.497
THIS WITH A CA THREE WHY DO YOU

08:18:47.564 --> 08:18:49.966
WANNA YOU KNOW SEE PEOPLE AS

08:18:50.033 --> 08:18:51.334
HUMANS- THAT DESERVE TO MAKE

08:18:51.401 --> 08:18:53.403
SOME SORT OF DIGNIFIED WAGE. AND

08:18:53.470 --> 08:18:56.106
THE COST OF BEING INCARCERATED

08:18:56.172 --> 08:18:59.009
IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. AND WE

08:18:59.075 --> 08:19:01.211
DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT AND

08:19:01.278 --> 08:19:03.046
SO I AM ACTUALLY APPLAUDING THE

08:19:03.113 --> 08:19:04.447
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD

08:19:04.514 --> 08:19:05.682
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS

08:19:05.749 --> 08:19:07.717
ABOUT. HOW HARD PEOPLE WORK IN

08:19:07.784 --> 08:19:11.054
PRISON AND NOW MEAGER THEIR

08:19:11.121 --> 08:19:14.758
WAGES ARE- AND IF THERE'S A WAY

08:19:14.824 --> 08:19:16.526
TO TRUST ACCOUNT SO THAT THINGS

08:19:16.593 --> 08:19:18.895
CAN BE DEPOSITED FOR THEM WHEN

08:19:18.962 --> 08:19:20.997
THEY GET OUT. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD

08:19:21.064 --> 08:19:22.399
BE THINKING CREATE ABOUT BEING

08:19:22.465 --> 08:19:24.100
HOW TO HELP FOLKS WITH FINANCIAL

08:19:24.167 --> 08:19:26.303
LITERACY PLANNING AND THEN HOW

08:19:26.369 --> 08:19:28.538
TO HELP THEM WHEN THEY GET OUT-

08:19:28.605 --> 08:19:29.939
BECAUSE THAT'S THE CYCLE OF

08:19:30.006 --> 08:19:31.841
REHABILITATION RATHER THAN

08:19:31.908 --> 08:19:32.876
ASKING FOLKS WHEN THEY LEAVE TO

08:19:32.942 --> 08:19:34.511
BE PERFECT TO MIGHT NOT MAKE ANY

08:19:34.577 --> 08:19:37.447
MISTAKES AND TO DO THIS WITH

08:19:37.514 --> 08:19:39.049
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. YOU KNOW IN

WHILE IT WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE A

08:19:55.265 --> 08:19:58.501
COST AS WAS POINTED OUT IN THE

08:19:58.568 --> 08:20:04.407
TESTIMONY. WE. WHAT WE ARE OW

WHAT WE THEN CHARGE THEM FOR

08:20:13.983 --> 08:20:15.785
THAT WHICH IS IN THE COMMISSARY

08:20:15.852 --> 08:20:18.855
OR FOR EVEN NET RIGHT NOW. WE

08:20:18.922 --> 08:20:20.323
ARE DURING THE PANDEMIC WE

08:20:20.390 --> 08:20:22.659
REDUCE THE COST TO MAKE ALMOST

08:20:22.726 --> 08:20:25.595
NO COST FOUR PHONE CALLS IN FACT

08:20:25.662 --> 08:20:29.499
BUT WHEN WE HAVE NOT. BE THE

08:20:29.566 --> 08:20:30.767
EVEN THE ABILITY TO CALL YOUR

08:20:30.834 --> 08:20:34.003
FAMILY. HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY

08:20:34.070 --> 08:20:37.607
EXPENSIVE SO. IT'S WE'VE GOT

08:20:37.674 --> 08:20:39.609
THAT SITUATION AND AT THE SAME

08:20:39.676 --> 08:20:42.479
TIME. THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED

08:20:42.545 --> 08:20:44.681
ARE NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR

08:20:44.748 --> 08:20:47.317
FAMILIES AND IN MANY CASES THEIR

08:20:47.384 --> 08:20:49.452
FAMILIES ARE THEN NEEDING TO BE

08:20:49.519 --> 08:20:53.556
SUPPORTED BY THE STATE. AND SO.

08:20:53.623 --> 08:20:55.792

VERY HIGH DEATHS AND ALREADY

08:20:58.194 --> 08:20:59.662
LIMITED ABILITY TO GET OUT OF

08:20:59.729 --> 08:21:02.999
EMPLOYMENT WHICH JUST CONTINUES

08:21:03.066 --> 08:21:06.369
THE CYCLE OF NOT ONLY POVERTY

08:21:06.436 --> 08:21:07.537
FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THEIR

08:21:07.604 --> 08:21:10.607
FAMILIES. AND SO. IS NOT A SMART

08:21:10.673 --> 08:21:13.410
SYSTEM IT DOESN'T LAND LIKE SO

08:21:13.476 --> 08:21:13.910

BECAUSE IF YOUR FAMILY IS NOT

08:21:21.117 --> 08:21:22.385
