01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:54.464 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM THAT THEY LOOK AT THE

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:55.765 region:rollup2

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:57.300 region:rollup2

IN THE CAR TAX AND ARMS

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:12.549 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING IS WIDESPREAD.

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:14.551 region:rollup2
LOCAL POLICE MAY LACK THE

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:17.087 region:rollup2

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:18.488 region:rollup2

CARE.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:40.643 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THIS BODY NEEDS TO

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:42.312 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHAT IS THE REALITIES

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:44.214 region:rollup2

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:48.017 region:rollup2
THE THREAT THAT HAD DEL SALVADOR

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:49.652 region:rollup2
BEFORE WHEN WE STARTED THIS HAS

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.354 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN RESOLVED FOR A LOT OF

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:53.790 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REASONS.

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:55.492 region:rollup2
SO I'D ASK US TO LOOK AT OUR

THERE IS A HUGE.

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:45.642 region:rollup2
