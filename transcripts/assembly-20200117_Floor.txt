I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS WHO ATTENDED YESTERDAY'S BREAKFAST AND ARE YOU WERE INSPIRED BY A SPEAKER IN BY THE ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR. CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE PROUD THAT IT WAS THE FIRST STATE TO THE BRIGHT THE LIFE OF DR KING. WE ARE EQUALLY PROUD THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AT THAT TIME. ADVOCATING FOR COMMEMORATIVE HOLIDAY THAT WAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. IT TOOK THREE ATTEMPTS TO GET IT DONE BUT THEY GOT IT DONE. AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY KNOWS BEST IS PERSISTENCE. WE KNOW THAT IF WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING THERE WILL BE OPPOSITION AND WE REQUIRE THE BEST OF US TO ACCOMPLISH IT. WE ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN UNSETTLING TIMES AND PERSISTENT AND JUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED AND THERE IS A REVIVAL OF OLD HATREDS. THAT WE THOUGHT LONG HAD BEEN TO PUT TO REST. ONCE AGAIN IS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY SAY DR KING'S LEGACY IS WHAT IT IS BUT HOW MUCH WE MEAN IT MEANS TO ALL OF US. THE RESOLUTION TODAY CHRONICLES DR KING'S LIFE IN THIS STRUGGLE IN THIS COUNTRY AS AN ORDINARY CITIZEN. TO DO EXTRAORDINARY WORK. AND WE LIVE IN HIS LEGACY TODAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE FOR ACR ONE FORTY SIX. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. THIS RACE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. ONE FORTY SIX WHICH HONORS THE LATE REVEREND DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. EVERY YEAR AS WE CELEBRATE THIS GREAT MAN WHO ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH IN HIS UNFORTUNATELY ABBREVIATED LIFE A WORD THAT ALWAYS COMES TO MIND IS SERVICE. SERVICE I'M SURE IS NOT A FOREIGN WORD TO ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM. WE ALL MADE THE DECISION TO RUN FOR OFFICE IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT SERVICE ISN'T JUST A WORD. I BELIEVE WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO LEARN WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM THE WAY DR KING EXEMPLIFIED SERVICE. FOR HIM SERVICE WAS A NECESSITY. NOT BASED ON EGO OR OR ON RECEIVING ACCOLADES. IT WAS A LIFE OR DEATH EVERY DAY DECISION. THIS WAS EVIDENT BY HIS COURAGE TO SAY THE THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE SAID. NO MATTER HOW UNPOPULAR. HIS WILLINGNESS TO BE IN THE PLACES THAT SAW THE GREATEST INJUSTICE NO MATTER HOW DANGEROUS. AND HIS COMPASSION WITH THE PEOPLE WHO FACE THE GREATEST INEQUITIES. WHETHER OR NOT THEY LOOK LIKE HIM. AS WE STEP INTO A NEW LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I IMPLORE US ALL TO REMEMBER WHY WE MADE THE DECISION TO SERVE THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE. AND I HOPE WE TAKE A PAGE FROM DOCTOR KING'S BOOK. AND SERVE WITH SIMILAR COURAGE WILLINGNESS AND COMPASSION. I HOPE WE ARE ABLE TO SAY THE TRUTH EVEN WHEN DIFFICULT AND TO DEMAND JUSTICE EVEN WHEN DANGEROUS AND TO DEFEND THE COMMUNITIES ON THE MARGINS OF SOCIETY. ESPECIALLY WOMEN. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES DISABLED COMMUNITIES ARE LGBT Q. FRIENDS AND OTHERS. EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE US FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS RAST MR GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS TO HONOR THE REMARKABLE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. THE JEWISH CAUCUSES PROUD TO JOIN IN RECOGNIZING DR KING AS ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICANS OF ANY GENERATION. DR KING IS ALWAYS OCCUPIED A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF AMERICAN JEWS. FOR MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY HE PERSONIFIED THE QUEST FOR FREEDOM HUMAN DIGNITY AND JUSTICE THAT ARE THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF JEWISH TRADITION. INDEED FEW IMAGES INSPIRE S MUCH EMOTION IN PRIDE IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AS THE ICONIC IMAGE OF RABBI ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL. THE MOST REVERED RABBI OF HIS GENERATION MARCHING ARM IN ARM WITH DOCTOR KING ACROSS THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE IN MARCH OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. AFTERWARDS IN WORDS THAT WERE QUOTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA HALF A CENTURY LATER RABBI HESCHEL REFLECTED THAT WHEN HE WAS MARCHING WITH DOCTOR KING HE FELT THAT HIS LEGS WERE PRAYING. THAT SAME YEAR THE AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE HONOR DOCTOR KING WITH HIS PRESTIGIOUS AMERICAN LIBERTIES BATTALION. IN RECOGNITION OF HIS EFFORTS TO ADVANCE CIVIL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR ALL AMERICANS. IN BOTH WORD AND DEED DOCTOR KING WAS ALSO A GREAT FRIEND AND ALLY TO THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN OUR OWN STRUGGLES. HE SPOKE OUT POWERFULLY AGAINST ANTI SEMITISM IN DEFENSE OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF PERSECUTED JEWS IN THE SOVIET UNION. DR KING NOTED THAT A SHARED HISTORY OF OPPRESSION AND A DEEP UNIVERSAL COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE BIND OUR COMMUNITIES. STATING MY PEOPLE WERE BROUGHT TO AMERICAN CHAINS. YOUR PEOPLE WERE DRIVEN HERE TO ESCAPE THE CHANGED FASHION FOR THEM IN EUROPE. OUR UNITY IS BORN OF COMMON STRUGGLE FOR CENTURIES NOT ONLY TO RID OURSELVES OF BONDAGE BUT TO MAKE OPPRESSION OF ANY PEOPLE BY OTHERS ANY POSSIBILITY. THIS WEEKEND YOU'RE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WILL HOLD SPECIAL SERVICES TO DOCTOR TO HONOR DOCTOR KING OFTENTIMES PARTNERING WITH OUR MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN NEIGHBORS IN FELLOWSHIP AND UNITY THAT REFLECTS HIS VISION. TOGETHER WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN ABOUT DOCTOR KING'S ENORMOUS BRAVERY HIS MORAL CLARITY AND HIS ON FINISH STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE. WE WERE REFLECT ON HIS TREMENDOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CRINGE AT HOW MUCH WORK REMAINS TO TRULY FULFILL HIS DREAM. AND WE WILL STRIVE TO HONOR HIS LEGACY BY JOINING HANDS TO FULFILL HIS VISION OF A MORE JUST WORLD. IN THAT SPIRIT AND ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY URGE SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING ONCE SAID LIFE'S MOST PERSISTENT AND URGENT QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR OTHERS. IN RECOGNITION OF DR KING'S INCREDIBLE LEGACY OF SERVICE TO WALL CONGRESS DESIGNATED THE MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR FEDERAL HOLIDAY. AS A NATIONAL DAY OF SERVICE IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. AS WE HEAD HOME TO OUR DISTRICTS THIS WEEKEND MY HOPE S THAT WE WILL ALL SPEND A FEW MINUTES TO REFLECT. ON THE BRIEF THIS BRIEF YET IMPORTANT QUESTION. AN APROPRIATE WAY TO HONOR DOCTOR KING IS THROUGH SERVICE AND VOLUNTEERING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. DR KING DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO ADVANCING THE QUALITY SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. HE CHALLENGED US TO BUILD A MORE PERFECT UNION AND TAUGHT US THAT EVERYONE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY I REGION I VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MISTER GLORIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LGBT Q. CAUCUS AS VICE CHAIR IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE FORTY SIX WITH APPRECIATION TO MY GREAT COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. MEMBERS TODAY WE HONOR A GIANT IN THE LEGACY OF ACTION IN A SOCIAL JUSTICE DOCTOR MARTIN KING JUNIOR'S LEGACY CONTINUES TO LIGHT A PATH FOR THOSE WHO FIGHT FOR EQUAL NON DISCRIMINATORY AND IMPARTIAL AMERICA. NEED COURSE AS ME MY COLLEAGUES ALREADY NOTED INSPIRED US TO RISE ABOVE HATEFUL RHETORIC TO PUSH FOR A QUALITY AT EVERY TURN EVEN WHEN IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE EVEN WHEN THE ODDS WERE LONG AND OF COURSE ON THE TIMES WERE SUCCESS WAS HAD. AS A COMMUNITY THAT IS UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISCRIMINATION THAT CONTINUES TO THIS DAY NAY THAT EQUITIES THAT WE IN DOOR WE RECOGNIZE THE INTERSECTION ALLERGY OF DR KING'S MOVEMENT THE FACT IT WAS MORE THAN JUST RACIAL CIVIL RIGHTS EQUALITY WORKERS RIGHTS POVERTY ELIMINATION DR KING'S UNDERSTOOD THE WORLD WAS INTER CONNECTED. AND AS A COMMUNITY THAT IS RARELY THE MAJORITY IN ANY PARTICULAR ROOM WE APPRECIATE THE ALLIES THAT COME TO OUR DEFENSE AND RECOGNIZE THE DOCTOR KING SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH ALLIES OF COURSE IS GREAT WIFE CREDIT SCOTT KING WAS A LONG A SUPPORTER OF THE LGBT Q. MOVEMENT CERTAINLY LONG BEFORE WAS POPULAR. NATURAIS MUST GO IT MUST BE BAD BAIRD RUSTIN THEN THE LG Q.

AND SO WE APPRECIATE DR KING IS A STRONG ALLY IT IS MOVEMENT THAT WE HAVE BENEFITTED FROM AND LET OUR VOICES IN SUPPORT OF THE ONGOING WORK THAT IS NEEDED FOR RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY.

COURAGE ARE CALLING IN CONSTITUENTS TO CONTINUE THE WORK OF JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK GLORIA IS YOUR COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I WISH TO RISE IN HONOR OF MARTIN LUTHER KING THEM KING ON THIS DAY- AND I WANT TO BRING TO YOU SOME REFLECTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE IN AMERICAN HISTORY PEOPLE ACTUALLY DID KNOW MARTIN LUTHER KING. BUT WHO SAID NATION THAT ARE. VERY APROPOS ON THIS DAY. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS THERE IS A YOUNG MAN MATTHEW HENSON. MATTHEW HENSON WENT TO THE NORTH POLE WITH WITH COMMODORE PERRY HE WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN EXPLORER. AND MATTHEW HENSON HAD INTERESTING VIEWS ABOUT LIFE THAT ARE VERY RELEVANT TO DOCTOR KING. HE SAID GREAT IDEALS OF THE GLORY OF MAN ALONE. NORTHERN CREECH CAN HAVE THEM. ONLY MAN CAN GET A VISION INSPIRATION TO LIFT HIM ABOVE THE LEVEL OF HIMSELF. AND SEND HIM FOURTH AGAINST ALL OPPOSITION AND DISCOURAGE BUT- TO DO AND TO DARE AND ACCOMPLISHED WONDERFUL A GREAT THING FOR THE WORLD FOR HUMANITY. SO UNDERSTAND WHICH WE HONOR MARTIN LUTHER KING I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE. THAT HE EXEMPLIFIES THIS VISION THAT WAS STATED BY MATTHEW HENSON. ANOTHER PATHFINDER IN AMERICAN HISTORY. ACTUALLY AND I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. A SHORT TIME LATER IN CHICAGO IN NINETEEN OH THREE. JANE ADDAMS WHO FOUNDED A GREAT ENTERPRISE IN CHICAGO TO SERVE THE NEEDY AND ARRIVING IMMIGRANTS. HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE QUALITIES OF OUTSTANDING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND AGAIN SHE NEVER KNEW MARTIN LUTHER KING. BUT LISTEN TO THIS IS A CHARACTERIZATION OF. OF WHAT OUR HISTORY NEEDS EVERY AUTUMN MARTIN TODAY. WHAT IS A GREAT MAN WHO HAS MADE HIS MARK IN HISTORY. EVERY TIME IF WE THINK FAR ENOUGH. HE IS A MAN WHO WAS LOOK TO THE CONFUSION OF THE MOMENT. AND IS SEEN THE MORAL ISSUE INVOLVED. HE IS A MAN WHO HAS REFUSED TO HAVE A SENSE OF JUSTICE DISTORTED. HE HAS LISTENED TO HIS CONSCIENCE UNTIL CONSCIENCE BECOMES A TRUMPET CALL TO LIKE MINDED MAN. SO THAT THEY GATHER ABOUT HIM AND TOGETHER WITH MUTUAL PURPOSE OF MUTUAL AID THEY MAKE A NEW PERIOD OF HISTORY. I WANT OF KNOWLEDGE OF COURSE THAT THESE ARE FROM THE FIRST DECADE OF THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS SO IT'S A LITTLE FOUR DOOR HERE HERE MAN THIS MAN THAT. COURSE WOULD MEAN PEOPLE. AND MARTIN LUTHER KING WHICH CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I JUST. I'M SO GRATEFUL ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US FOR MY. GRAND DAUGHTER ANNA. THE WE LIVE IN THIS NATION WE HAVE PEOPLE SUCH VISION AND WHAT A GREAT DAY TO HONOR AMERICAN VISIONARY. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER DOCTOR WEBER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE VARIOUS CAUCUSES FOR THEIR COMMENTS CONCERNING DOCTOR KING. AND HIS SIGNIFICANCE TO US. YOU KNOW I'VE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE I THINK- TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH. TO REMEMBER DCTOR KING. AT ACTUALLY REMEMBER SEEING THE MARCHES ON TELEVISION LIVE SAYING THERE YOU ARE MARCH ON WASHINGTON SEEING THE SELMA INCIDENTS SAYING THOUGH IT WATER HOLES TURNED ON INDIVIDUALS AND THE DOGS TURNED ON THEM. I'VE ALSO HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF. GOING TO THE SOUTH OF DURING THE ERA IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND SIXTIES. AND BE AND SEEING THE KIND OF DISCRIMINATION THAT EXISTED. AND THE FEAR AND THE DIFFICULTY OF PEOPLE TRYING TO LIVE JUST ORDINARY LIVES EVERY DAY. AND THEN I HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF ACTUALLY BEING HERE WHEN DOCTOR KING WAS ASSASSINATED I WAS AT UCLA. AND WATCHING WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON TELEVISION. AND HAVING THE FEELING OF LOSS AND ABANDONMENT THAT OCCURRED FROM MY STUDENTS. WE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE FILLED WITH PEACE WOULD BE TAKEN OUT IN SUCH A VIOLENT MANNER. AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL A SENSE OF LOSS IN THE MIDST OF. AN ERA THAT WE THOUGHT WAS FILLED WITH HOPE. SO IT'S INTERESTING AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND DR KING'S LEGACY COMES FORTH. WE HAD YESTERDAY MR MCCARTY SELLERS WHOSE FATHER WAS WHAT WHAT PART OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. TALK IN PERSONAL TERMS BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE CAN GET CAUGHT UP IN THE SPEECHES AND THE STATEMENT THAT PEOPLE MAKE. AND WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE PERSONAL COMMITMENT. AND THE PERSONAL LOSS THAT SO MANY INDIVIDUALS SUFFERED IN THIS COUNTRY BLACK WHITE JEWISH INDIVIDUALS WHO BASICALLY WERE KILLED WHEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA STANDING UP FOR JUST SIMPLE THINGS. LIKE TO WRITE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE OR TO MARY WHO YOU WANT WHAT TO DO THE THINGS THAT WE TAKE SO MUCH FOR GRANTED. AND SO I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE OF AS A PART OF MY LIFE THAT IS A DRIVING FORCE. ABOUT THE SENSE OF URGENCY IN HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO ACHIEVE THE KIND OF JUSTICES THAT BEARD. I ALSO HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE FEELING AT THIS POINT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS IN THIS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY. THAT I'M WOULD BEING PULLED BACK INTO AN ERA. THAT WE DON'T WANT TO EVER GO BACK TO AGAIN. THE HATRED. THE DISCRIMINATION THE BURNING THE SHOOTINGS THE THINGS THAT ARE BASED ON RACE AND GENDER AND RELIGION THAT IS SO UNFORTUNATE THAT MARRED THIS COUNTRY. THAT MARRED THIS COUNTRY AND MADE A MAN HAVE TO GIVE HIS IN HIS LIFE FOR US. TO BASICALLY REMEMBER THAT THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. AND SO I FEEL A SIN SO IT'S INTERESTING AS I STAND HERE ON THIS FLOOR- HAVING BEEN A PERSON WHO WILL BE OBSERVED IT. AND FELT IT AND THEN STUDIED IT AS A STUDENT AT UCLA IN MY DOCTORAL WORK TO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS MOVEMENTS THAT OCCURRED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND TO KNOW HOW MUCH SACRIFICE THAT PEOPLE PUT INTO MAKING SMALL PROGRESS. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE AS WE SIT HERE AND WE'VE ALL BENEFITTED FROM DOCTOR KING'S PRESENCE WHETHER IT'S BEING ELECTED TO OFFICE AND HAVING COMMUNITIES TO EMBRACE US- THAT NORMALLY WOULD NOT HAVE EMBRACED US. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY. TO FIGHT. EIGHT TO NOT LOSE SIGHT. TO BECOME INDIGNANT A- DISCRIMINATION AND RACISM AND SEXISM WE HAVE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SHARE THIS ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CELEBRATING INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT IT MEANS TO CELEBRATE. IF THERE HAD BEEN NO MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. IF THERE HAD BEEN NO A NATIONAL CELEBRATION. WE PROBABLY WOULD FORGET ABOUT KING. WE PROBABLY WOULD LOSE OUR SENSIBILITIES TO THE KIDS OF ISSUES THAT HE RAISED. BUT FORTUNATELY HAVING A NATIONAL HOLIDAY A STATE HOLIDAY IN A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. BRINGS US BACK TOGETHER EVERY YEAR. TO REMIND US HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO REMIND US OF THE DEBT THAT WE HAVE TO PAY. THAT IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT US BUT IT'S ABOUT THIS NATION IN THE FUTURE THAT'S THE YEAR. AND AS THIS NATION TEETERS ON ALL OF THESE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE WILL SEE THIS WEEKEND. THE MARCH IS A IN IN VIRGINIA WITH NOW THERE MAY BE VERY VOLATILE BECAUSE- FOLKS OF FIGHTING EACH OTHER. OVER THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE THINK ARE EMBEDDED IN THIS NATION. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A LEGISLATOR WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS CITIZENS. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY JUST AS HUMAN BEINGS WHO WANT A BETTER WORLD FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN. I WAS READING THE OTHER DAY THE THOSE THE SPEECH THAT KING GAVE WHEN HE RECEIVED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. ANY TALK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT. HE SAID HE HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT THAT WE ARE POWERLESS. HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT THAT THE NORMAL VIOLENCE AND MILITARISM IS A WAY OF LIFE. HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT THOSE THINGS BUT HE ALSO SAID HE HAD AN ABIDING FAITH. IN THE ABILITY OF MAN TO RESURRECT HIMSELF IF FROM THE MIDST OF ALL OF THIS. AND TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND THAT EVEN IF WE LOSE ONE OF THE BATTLES TO THE EVIL FORCES. IN THE END WE WILL RISE AND WIN. AND SO I CALL UPON YOU TODAY TO AS WE HONOR DOCTOR KING. AN HONOR THIS PARTICULAR OF AC ARE. ALL ON THIS ACR ONE FORTY SIX ON THIS FLOOR. THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF WHY WE'RE HERE. THAT WE HAVE A DEBT TO PAY. AND IT'S STILL THIS NATION IS TO OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES. AND THAT AS WE FACE WHAT WE THINK IS SUCH A HORRIBLE REALITIES RIGHT NOW. THAT WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE WE HAVE THE ABILITY WE HAVE THE POWER. IF WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PRINCIPLES HE FOUGHT FOR THAT WERE AMERICAN PRINCIPLES.
