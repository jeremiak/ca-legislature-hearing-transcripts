WHO ELECTED*? AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT TONE. COMES FROM THE VERY TOP. THAT COLLEGIALITY THAT FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY THAT FOCUSED ON GOOD WORKS THAT COMES FROM OUR LEADERSHIP. DOESN'T MEAN DOLLAR SAID A GOOD HEAD AND A GOOD HEART ARE A FORMIDABLE COMBINATION. AND OUR LEADER ANTHONY RENDON CERTAINLY POSSESSES BUT MANY OF YOU KNOW HE'S BEEN AN EDUCATOR HE'S BEEN THE NONPROFIT DIRECTOR HE'S BEEN ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY HE HAS PRESIDED OVER SOME OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE. AND PRODUCTIVE LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS IN MEMORY. PASSING A LANDMARK FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PLAN. EXTENDING CALIFORNIA'S CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND PROTECTING OUR COASTLINE FROM OFFSHORE DRILLING. HE'S CONFRONTED OUR FORMAL HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. SPEAR HEADING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET FOR HOMELESSNESS AND UNDER THE SPEAKERS LEADERSHIP ARE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE ASSEMBLY HAS GROWN FROM.

OR DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS NOW INCLUDES TWENTY ONE WOMEN. WHICH MATCHES THE HISTORICAL RECORD FOR THIS LEGISLATURE. INDEED THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS DOUBLED UNDER SPEAKER RENDON'S TEN YEAR. NOW MORE THAN EVER TO SPEAKERS COMMITMENT TO EMPOWERING THE VOICES OF WOMEN BOTH IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND ACROSS OUR STATE IS BOTH ENCOURAGING AND NECESSARY. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

KNOCKING ON DOORS WITH ME TO TALK TO VOTERS IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. OTHER LEADERS MAY NOT HAVE GONE TO SUCH GREAT LENGTHS. MAYBE POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA. GOT A PHOTO WALK.

MISTER RENDER ON HAS SPENT MANY YEARS IN EDUCATION AND AS AN EDUCATOR MYSELF FOR THIRTY YEARS WE HAVE MUCH IN COMMON.

HE IN HIS PAST WITH THE LEADER IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT IN ADDITION TO THAT HE ALSO HAS SUPPORTED HEALTHY START PROGRAMS EVEN START PROGRAMS EARLY START PROGRAMS -- WHICH HE IS THE SUGGESTION THAT WHEN WE INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN. AS YOUNGSTERS WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A PATH FORWARD. ONE N!N NELSON MANDELA ONCE SAID. THERE CAN BE NO KEENER REVELATION OF A SOCIETY'S SOUL THAN THE WAY IN WHICH IT TREATS ITS CHILDREN. THIS SENTIMENT READINGS AS TRUE TO ME AS I KNOW IT DOES WITH HIM. IS A LEE AND HIS ALLEGIANCE TO HIS PRINCIPLED IDEALS.

TO GRADUATE YEAH WE DO ANYTHING ELSE LET US REFLECT ON CALIFORNIA'S RECENT. HORRENDOUS FIRES. NO MATTER WHAT THE SIZE OF THE FIRE. IT IS THE BIGGEST EVENTS IN EVERY LIFE IT TOUCHES. LET US THINK OF THOSE OF US EVEN AS THEY COME TO BE SWORN IN. WHO ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH CARING FOR THE PEOPLE IN THEIR DISTRICTS? SINCE WE RECESSED AT THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST NEW FIRES HAVE BROKEN OUT IN THE LEVIN COUNTIES. LISTED CHRONOLOGICALLY THEY ARE PLACERVILLE [inaudible] MONACO [inaudible] TRINITY [inaudible] SHASTA [inaudible] NAPA. LOS ANGELES. TULARE [inaudible] SOLANA [inaudible] TO HAMMER VIEW. AND VENTURA COUNTIES. OUR MEMBERS ARE WORRYING ABOUT THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES. THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES. AND THOSE WHO SHOWED EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM. WEATHER WAS FIREFIGHTERS LAW ENFORCEMENT. MEDICAL PERSONNEL. OR THE MANY MANY VOLUNTEERS PROVIDING THE AID TO THE DISPLACED. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO THE LIVES LOST IN GUN. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SPECIALLY THOSE TAKEN IN THE RECENT TRAGEDY OF THOUSAND OAKS.THAT IS ALL GO BEYOND THE USUAL MOMENT OF SILENCE. AND USE THIS MOMENT TO CONSIDER WHAT WE ARE HERE. FOR WHICH IS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA. LET'S THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WILL DO IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. A MOMENT'S SILENCE PLEASE THANK YOU. BEING CHOSEN TO AGAIN SERVICE SPEAKER IS ALL THE MORE AN HONOR. BECAUSE IT AS A TACIT KNOWLEDGE MINT OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE HERE. IN THE ASSEMBLY. MY GOAL WAS TO USE THIS OFFICE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. TO DO THAT I AIM TO WORK TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE. FOR ALL OF YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY SUCCESSFUL UP TO NOW. MAKING THINGS BETTER FOR CALIFORNIANS INCLUDED INCLUDES WRITING HISTORIC WRONGS AND EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. THAT'S WHAT WE DID BY TACKLING BAIL REFORM TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE STAYS IN JAIL. JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR. THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN PROVIDING FARM WORKER OVERTIME. TO THOSE WHO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FOOD ON OUR TABLE. AND IT'S WHAT WE DID WHEN WE EXPANDED THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLES. WE ALSO FOUND A WAY TO PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA RELIES ON AND WE DID IT WITHOUT GOING INTO DEBT. WHEN THEY ELECTED AS LAST MONTH? CALIFORNIA'S ALSO SHOWED THAT THEY SAW THROUGH THIS CYNICAL CAMPAIGN THAT WAS AS MUCH ABOUT SNAKE OIL. AS A WAS ABOUT THE GAS TAX. WE HAVE TAKEN MAJOR STEPS TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND INUNDATED IN OUR USE OF CAP AND TRADE TO COUNTERACT CLIMATE CHANGE AND BRING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. YEAR AFTER YEAR THE ASSEMBLY HAS PUT TOGETHER IN APPROVED BUDGETS THAT EXPAND WHAT WE PROVIDE FOR CALIFORNIANS IN A WAY THAT PLANS FOR THE FUTURE. BOTH GOOD. AND BAD. WE HAVE INVESTED IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION K. THROUGH TWELVE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT'S BUILDING FOR A STRONGER FUTURE. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE SET ASIDE RECORD RESERVES AS A CUSHION AGAINST BAD TIMES AND MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS AS WE PUSH FOR WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE THREAD THAT RUNS THROUGH ALL OF THESE POLICY VICTORIES IS MAKING THINGS BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. JUST THAT ONE GOAL. LET'S LEAVE OUR STATE BETTER THAN WHEN WE FOUND IT. OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING IMPORTANT. WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA LEADS TO SUCCESS. AND THOSE SUCCESSES ARE REWARDED. BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. JUST MAKING THINGS BETTER IS IS REALLY. WHY ALL OF YOU ARE HERE BOTH YOU COMMERCE? AND THOSE WHO ARE RETURNING. WE HAVE MADE THINGS BETTER IN CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THEY THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS SAID THEY LIKED WHAT WE'RE DOING. I WANT TO LOOK BACK FOR A SECOND. LOOK BACK TO THE SWEARING IN TWO YEARS AGO. WHEN THE OUTLOOK WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT? I KNEW THEN THAT WE ARE ENTERING PERILOUS TERRITORY. MY WORST FEARS HAVE NOT YET MATERIALIZED WE'VE IT OR NOT. BUT THE FEDERAL REALITY HAS BEEN QUITE BAD ENOUGH. IN THE LAST MONTH WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HEAPING BLAME ON CALIFORNIA A STATE THAT IS SUFFERING ITS WORST FIRE DISASTER EVER. I WOULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED. THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD NEGLECT A TO A HEAVILY POPULATED ISLAND DECIMATED BY HURRICANE. AND YET SEND TROOPS TO LONELY OUT LONELY BORDER OUTPOSTS TO DO NOTHING. BUT POSTURE. TWO YEARS AGO BEFORE THAT MAN EVEN TOOK OFFICE I SAID CALIFORNIA MUST BE DEFIANT WHENEVER JUSTICE FAIRNESS AND RIGHTS JUSTICE REQUIRE A WE HAVE BACK THOSE ACTIONS UP WITH WORDS. WE HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON POVERTY WE'VE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ON BAIL REFORM ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND WE'VE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THE ASSEMBLY HAS NOT BEEN ALONE IN THIS. WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY THE GOVERNOR. THE SENATE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SO MANY. BUT NOBODY NOBODY BELIEVES THAT WE'RE DONE WITH OUR WORK. IF WE HAD ALL THE IF WE HAD DONE ALL THERE IS TO BE DO IT DONE. THERE BE NO NEED TO BE SWORN IN TODAY WE CAN JUST GO HOME. MOVE WE'RE NOT GOING OUT. WE TEND TO SPEND THE NEXT TWO YEARS CONTINUING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR CALIFORNIANS. THOSE OF US WHO ARE MEMBERS OF ETHNIC MINORITIES OR WOMEN ARE PART OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR OF A LATER -- I'M SURE THAT WHERE. YOU'RE KIDDING -- THE CAUCUS SEVEN YEAH. THOSE IF YOU ARE PART OF OF THOSE COMMUNITIES MAY FIND OUR TASK ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE HISTORICALLY WE FELT FROZEN OUT OF THE HALLS OF DECISION MAKING. BUT NOW WE'RE HERE. AND OUR NUMBERS ARE GROWING. LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BELONGED TO ETHNIC MINORITIES. AND THIS YEAR AS AS HAS BEEN STATED. THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS HAS TWENTY ONE WOMEN. THAT'S AS MANY AS ANY MAJORITY CAUCUS IN HISTORY AND NEARLY TWICE AS MANY WOMEN. AS WHEN I BECAME SPEAKER. EACH OF OUR NEW COLLEAGUES HAS AN INSPIRING LIFE STORY LEADING TO THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE ASSEMBLY. BUFFY WORKS GREW UP IN A MOBILE HOME IN PLASTER COUNTY. SHE WENT ON TO BE AN ANTI WAR ORGANIZER AND A WHITE HOUSE STAFFER HOPPING PRESIDENT OBAMA. PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. REBEKAH MARK A HAND IS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF REFUGEES WHO CAME TO UNITED STATES TO ESCAPE THE HOLOCAUST. THEIR REFUGEE EXPERIENCE INSPIRED REBEKAH TO HELP OTHER IMMIGRANTS. INCLUDING WORKING TO AID THOSE WHO'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE JUST TRAVEL AROUND [inaudible] ROBERT REAVIS. RUBBER GREW UP AND FARM WORKER HOUSING CARED FOR BY A SINGLE MOTHER. AND GRANDPARENTS WHO IMMIGRATED FROM MEXICO TO SAN BENITO COUNTY. HE OVERCAME A DISABILITY THROUGH HIS MOTHER'S COMMITMENT. TO USE HER SAVINGS FOR HIS SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. CHRISTY SMITH WAS BORN OVERSEAS WHILE HER FATHER WAS IN THE MILITARY. SHE STARTED WORKING TO BETTER THE SITUATION OF WORKERS EARLY ON BEING THE YOUNGEST LABOR LEADER TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. JAMES RAMEAU'S THE FIRST NATIVE AMERICAN ELECTED TO THE SAMPLE TO DO YOU KNOW COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THE FIRST NATIVE AMERICAN APPOINTED TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AND TODAY HE IS NOW THE FIRST CALIFORNIA LEGISLATOR BORN ON NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL TERRITORY KILEY PETER YOURS HAS ALWAYS HAD HER EYES ON THE LARGER WORLD THAT SHE MET HER HUSBAND CALLING IN SOUTH AFRICA. AND HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AS AMERICAN AFTER BECAME IT TO BECOMING A CITIZEN. LAST YEAR INCLUDING VOTED INCLUDED VOTING [inaudible] MISTY SAID. TYLER DEEPS FAMILY RELIED ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE WHEN THEY IMMIGRATED FROM VIETNAM BUT THEY PERSISTED TO SEE HAVE BECOME THE FIRST IN HIS FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE IN THE US. HE ACQUIRED A PASSION FOR PUBLIC SERVICE AND WAS ELECTED TO OFFICE AT TWENTY THREE TASHA BURNER HORVATH ALSO EMBODIES CALIFORNIA'S MULTICULTURAL OUTLOOK. HAVING LIVED IN EUROPE WHERE SHE MET HER HUSBAND AND WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR TWO CHILDREN. THE BILINGUAL FAMILY SPEAKS ENGLISH AND GERMAN AT HOME. THIS IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST NEW CLASSES WE'VE SEEN. BUT I KNOW THIS GROUP IS NOT SMALL WHEN IT COMES TO ENERGY. AND WHEN IT COMES TO IDEAS. WE WELCOME THEIR TALENTS AND ENTHUSIASM BECAUSE THE NEEDS ARE URGENT. GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN IS KNOWN FOR TALKING ABOUT HOW DIRE THE CLIMATE SITUATION IS IT IS DIRE. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT NOW. THE WILDFIRES HAVE ADDED AN EXCLAMATION POINT TO THAT BUT THEY ALSO BRING QUESTION MARKS ON SHORT TERM SAFETY. AND ENERGY SECURITY. WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF IGNORING THE FIRES. WILDFIRES IN FACT INJECT FEAR AND PRESENT DANGERS TO NEARLY EVERY CALIFORNIANS BUT LET ME REMIND YOU THAT SOME CALIFORNIANS HAVE LESS PROTECTION THAN OTHERS. GLANCES IN CLASSES WERE CANCELED AT UNIVERSITIES DUE TO SMOKE FROM THE CAMPFIRE. BUSINESSES WERE CLOSED IN CHILDREN WERE KEPT INDOORS. BUT THE HOMELESS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SPEND ALL DAY READING TOXIC AIR FROM THE FIRE. WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO DO ON HOUSING AND WE HAVE MORE TO DO AND ECONOMIC INJUSTICE BECAUSE ECONOMIC INJUSTICE IS A FACTOR. IN NEARLY EVERYTHING WE WORK ON WHETHER WE TALK ABOUT IT OR NOT. AND I'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN A MOMENT. USUALLY I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA EXCEPTIONALISM. I HAVE THE LUXURY OF TALKING ABOUT IT STATE THAT HAS LONG BEEN WELCOMING OF IT OF IMMIGRANTS. AND HAS BEEN RICHER BECAUSE OF IT. I CAN TALK ABOUT UNPARALLELED NATURAL RESOURCES THE DRAW THE WORLD TO OUR BEACHES AND OUR MOUNTAINS. I CAN TALK ABOUT AN ECONOMY THE KEEP INNOVATING FROM THE DAYS OF MOVIES AND AEROSPACE. TO PRESENT DAY OF THE STATE WIDE WINE COUNTRY AND SILICON DREAMS. I CAN TALK ABOUT ARTISTIC ACHIEVEMENT A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR DAVID HOCKNEY PAINTING RECENTLY SET AT AUCTION A RECORD. AND IT DOES EVERYTHING TO ITS CALIFORNIA SETTING. WHEN I MODERATED A PANEL AT UCLA EARLIER THIS YEAR ANOTHER EXCEPTIONAL ARTIST THE THEATER DIRECTOR PETER SALAS BROUGHT ME DOWN TO EARTH? WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA EXCEPTIONALISM? PETER SAID YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA EXCEPTIONAL. WE PUT PEOPLE IN PRISON AT A RATE HIGHER THAN ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD INCLUDING CHINA. AND RUSSIA. WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL IS WE HAVE A BIGGER HOMELESS POPULATION THAN ANYWHERE ELSE? WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL AS WE HAVE A HUGE WATER CRISIS THAT IS BEING LARGELY IGNORED? HOW CAN WE BE PROUD OF OUR VIBRANT TACK ECONOMY THE ENVY OF THE WORLD? IF THE UNDENIABLY BRILLIANT MINDS OF THAT SECTOR ARE USED ONLY TO GENERATE HUGE PERSONAL WEALTH FOR A FEW. AND MISERY FOR OTHERS. WE MUST USE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF WORKERS AS WELL AS INVESTORS FOR THE HOMELESS AS WELL AS FOR TOURISTS AND THE HOMEOWNERS WITH EXTRA ROOMS TO RENT OUT. WE CAN NOT MAKE HOUSING AFFORDABLE FOR THE MASSES WHEN THE 1% EARNING HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF TIMES THE AVERAGE WORKER. AND WE CAN NOT IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK -- FACE PREDATORY LENDERS CHARGING OUT READ JUST INTEREST RATES WHILE MASSIVE CORPORATIONS GET PUBLIC HANDOUTS IN THE HOPES OF TRICKLE DOWN BENEFITS THAT WE ALL KNOW WILL NEVER REACH PEOPLE ON THE BOTTOM. THESE ARE BI PARTISAN CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRE BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS. I BELIEVE THAT THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS HAS A ROLE IN MAKING CALIFORNIA BETTER.

HOUSE RESOLUTION ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY RELATIVE TO THE STANDING RULES OF THE ASSEMBLY FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY REGULAR SESSION. MISTER COOLEY YOU MAY OPEN. MISTER SPEAKER IS A NON OR ON THE STATE TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS FLOOR. AND I THINK YOU SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUR ARE MARKS REFLECTING UPON. BUT I'VE ALWAYS FELT. CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. IN THE GLOW. WE ENTER INTO THE PUBLIC'S WORK. INDEED TO MY COLLEAGUES I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE OF ANY BILL YOU AUTHOR. IS NOT THE LINE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. IT'S A LINE. IT SAYS THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO AN ACTRESS FALLS. WE ARE CHARGED ON THIS FLOOR. WITH KERRY FOR THE PUBLIC'S WORK. THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THE MANTLE. OF THE FUTURE. UPON US ON THIS BY. THIS IS WHY WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO BROADEN. THE CAPACITY OF CALIFORNIANS TO VOTE. ALIGNS WITH THIS BASIC IDEA IN EVERY BILL. THAT THE POWER WE KERRY. IS THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. AND WHAT WE DO IN VOTING OPENING. VOTING TO AS MANY CALIFORNIANS AS WE MAY. ALIGNS WITH THIS VERY FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE. OF A PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. AND THESE RULES. HR ONE AS I BRING IT TO TODAY. IS THE COMPANION. TO THIS NOTION. BECAUSE AS THE SPEAKERS NOTED WE HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCED LAW MAKING BODY. THIS BEEN ON THIS CARPET IN MORE THAN TWO DECADES. AND THE HOUSE RULES ARE THE FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH WE DO OUR WORK. AND SUPPORT THAT EMPOWER. HOUSE RESOLUTION ONE ESTABLISHES THE STANDARD RULES IN THE ASSEMBLY. FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SESSION. IT INCLUDES VARIOUS CHANGES TO THE STANDARD RULES THAT WERE PLACE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SESSION. SOME OF THESE CHANGES INCLUDE. REVISED IN THE NAME OF THE PERSON COMMITTING.

MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION HR ONE COLLEAGUES MANY OF THE RULE CHANGES WERE CONSIDERING TODAY ARE ON CONTROVERSIAL HOWEVER THERE IS ONE THAT IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING. AND THAT IS A CHANGE THAT ALLOWS POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DECIDE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHICH BILLS TO GRANT POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS. TO THAT IS A VIOLATION OF LONG STANDING CUSTOM AND PRACTICE IN THIS CHAMBER OF ASSURING THAT EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT'S INTRODUCED GETS PAID HEARING. CHAIRMAN UNDER THESE NEW RULES WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO ESSENTIALLY KILL A BILL BY DENYING IT HEARING SINCE BILLS REQUIRE HEARING TO MOVE FORWARD. AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS NOT ONLY WITHOUT A HEARING. BUT WITHOUT A VOTE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OR WITHOUT ANY TESTIMONY FROM THE PUBLIC. THAT IS A VIOLATION NOT ONLY OF THE LONG STANDING PRACTICE OF THIS CHAMBER BUT ALSO OF THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY ITSELF I URGE A NO VOTE. ALL THE BAY HAVE A CEASE MISTER COOLEY MAKE CLOTHES.
