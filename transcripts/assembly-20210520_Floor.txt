OKAY MILWAUKEE MELVIN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LGBT Q. CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF HR FORTY THREE TODAY WE HONOR HARVEY MILK A HERO IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY HARVEY WAS THE FIRST OPENLY GAY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN CALIFORNIA AND OF ANY MAJOR UNITED STATES CITY A GLOBAL ICON AND A PIONEER IN THE LGBTQ CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THIS WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE NOW. HARVEY WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN SEVERAL LOCAL ELECTIONS BEFORE HE WON A SEAT ON THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. IS UNPRECEDENTED VICTORY AND THE WAVES HE MADE IN JUST ONE YEAR CONTINUE TO INSPIRE US TODAY. WORKING TO FIGHT HOMOPHOBIA AND OTHER FORMS OF LGBTQ DISCRIMINATION MILK WAS OFTEN THE LOUDEST VOICE AT A TIME WHEN MANY WERE AFRAID TO BE THEMSELVES. HE ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY TO SHOW THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO THEY WERE AND EXPRESS THEIR TRUE IDENTITIES. HARVEY'S LIFE WAS TRAGICALLY CUT SHORT WHEN A FORMER COLLEAGUE ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ASSASSINATED HIM ALONG WITH SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR GEORGE MOSCONI. HARVEY'S KILLER WAS CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER INSTEAD OF MURDER AND INJUSTICE THAT SPARKED RIOTS. THE OUTCOME OF THAT TRIAL SERVES AS A STARK REMINDER THAT WE MUST ALWAYS BE VIGILANT IN MAKING SURE THAT EQUITY IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS PRESENT. HARVEY WON SAID. I KNOW YOU CAN'T LIVE ON HOPE ALONE. BUT WITHOUT HOPE LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING. IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE YET TO ENSURE EQUALITY FOR ALL HARVEY'S IMPACT AS A TRAILBLAZER AND CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATE CATALYZE POLICY INSPIRED PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND TO BE THEMSELVES TO RUN FOR OFFICE AND TO BE AT THE TABLE. HE STILL MOVES US TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT FOR WHAT HE STARTED I RESPECTFULLY ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR FORTY THREE. THANK YOU MISTER MOORE IS PARA QUE HAND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR FIFTY THREE. I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER FROM SILICON VALLEY FOR BRINGING IMPORTANT MEASURE AND THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO FOR SPEAKING SO ELOQUENTLY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF IT. TODAY WE CELEBRATE AND COMMEMORATE THE PIONEERING LIFE AND CAREER OF HARVEY MILK. HARVEY MILK WAS A MIDDLE CLASS JEWISH KID FROM NEW YORK. WHOSE GRANDFATHER FOUNDED A SYNAGOGUE. THEY'RE NOT RELIGIOUS HE SPOKE YIDDISH WITH FRIENDS AND EVEN CONSIDERED OPENING A JEWISH DELI IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND IS ALL THE BARE MEMBERS KNOW WE WOULD APPRECIATED THAT MANY YEARS BEFORE IT HAPPENED. HE MADE HISTORY IS ONE OF THE FIRST OPENLY GAY ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES. WHEN HE WON HIS SEAT ON THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. EVEN IN HIS SHORT CAREER IN POLITICS HE MADE HISTORIC STRIDES. FIGHTING FOR EQUAL TREATMENT AND RAISING THE FIGHT FOR LGBTQ RIGHTS WHEN THEY WERE UNDER BRUTAL ATTACK. HARVEY MILK EMBODIES THE JEWISH VALUES OF HEALING THE WORLD OF QUESTIONING ON JUST TO FORTY. AND ADVOCATING FIERCELY. HE WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED AS AN ADVOCATE FOR GAY RIGHTS AND FOR ALL MNORITY GROUPS FACING DISCRIMINATION. SIR ON THIS GREEN CARPET. JUST TWO YEARS BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED. HE WAS A LEADER LIKE SO MANY OF US HERE. WHO RESPONDED TO THE OUTCRY OF HIS COMMUNITY. DRIVEN BY HIS VALUES. BEGINNING A POLITICAL CAREER YOUNG. AND HAVING IT ENDED WAY TOO EARLY. WE CANNOT LET THE FORCES OF HATE SHAKE US FROM OUR DEDICATION TO THE JUSTICE I HEARD SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE TO REMIND US OF WHY WE FIGHT. TO HONOR HARVEY MILK AS A LEGENDARY FIGHTER WHO THIS CHAMBER WOULD HAVE BEEN HONORED TO HAVE STAND AMONG US I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR FORTY THREE. NAME IS BURKE HAND MR MCCARTY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF OUR BLACK LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I ALSO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR FORTY THREE TO RECOGNIZE AND HONOR HARVEY MILK DAY ON WHICH WOULD BE HIS NINETY FIRST BIRTHDAY. THIS SATURDAY HIS LEGACY AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER AN LGBTQ ACTIVIST AND ICON IS STILL FELT TODAY. HE SAID ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY THEY CAN NEVER ERASE THOSE WORDS THAT IS WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT AND THAT CERTAINLY SIMILAR WITH THEIR- BLACK. EXPERIENCE ACROSS AMERICAN OUR CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND STATE AS WELL. THROUGH HIS COMPASSION AND PERSEVERANCE MISTER MILK DID EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE THE STATE AND COUNTRY LIVE UP TO THOSE WORDS. HE IS KNOWN AS THE MOST PROLIFIC FIGURE IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY IN THIS PATH TO OFFICE WAS NOT EASY. LIKE MANY AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES HE EXPERIENCE PREJUDICE DISCRIMINATION AND THREATS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE BUT PERSEVERED. I WILL NOTE AS WE KNOW. AS WE GRAPPLE WITH SOME HOT ISSUES AN IMPORTANT ISSUES. OF BLACK AMERICAN BLACK CALIFORNIA DAY ONE BEING POLICE VIOLENCE AND POLICE REFORM- MR MILKEN MR MOSCONI WERE IN THE FOREFRONT RIGHT BEFORE HIS ASSASSINATION LEADING ON WHAT ISSUE. POLICE REFORM IN HIS CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HONOR HIS LEGACY. AND THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS CERTAINLY KNOW THE MOVEMENTS THAT HE LED AND PERSEVERED TODAY I WITH THAT MISTER SPEAKER I ASKED WE HAD DURING HIS IN AN HONOR- HARVEY MILK DAY. THIS WEEKEND. THANK YOU MISTER CARTER THIS PROVIDES. IN THE REAR OF THE CHURCH. YOUR THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND A PROUD KOBACH THERE. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF H. R. FORTY THREE COMMEMORATING HARVEY MILK DAY. FOR ALL G. B. T. Q. PEOPLE COMING OUT IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN LIVING FREELY AND AUTHENTICALLY A SPIRIT THAT HARVEY MILK EMBODIED. HE SERVED AS A TRAILBLAZER A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. MAYBE VETERAN PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AND A POLITICIAN. THE SPARK UNITY AROUND THE WORLD. DURING THE TIME OF IT. AND WITHIN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE L. G. B. MOVEMENT AT HARVEY MILK USE HIS INTELLIGENCE HIS WILL TO LEAD. AN INFECTIOUS PERSONALITY. TO BE. YOU BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO STAND AGAINST ANTI LGBTQ HATRED. AS IS ACTIVISM INCREASE HE BELIEVED THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE CHANGE YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE AT THE CENTER OF THE POLITICAL REFORM HE KNEW THAT HE HAD TO USE HIS VOICE AS A PATHWAY FOR LGBTQ CANDIDATES TO RUN FOR ELECTED OFFICE HER REMARK WAS AN ADVOCATE NOT ONLY FOR LGBTQ POPULATION BUT FOR WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. THE CALIFORNIA WHAT NEXT LGBTQ COMMUNITY ENCOMPASSES A DOCTOR OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL I NEXT FOLKS REPRESENTING THE GREAT EXPERIENCE AND DIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA FROM ACTIVE MILITARY SERVICE PUBLIC SERVANTS CORPORATE LEADERS BUT THE YOU KNOW- G. B. T. Q. INDIVIDUALS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN LEADING A NEW AGE IN CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP. THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE L. G. B. T. Q. AND WHAT NEXT COMMUNITIES. HISTORICALLY ARE CONTINUE TO BE A VITAL OF. HISTORY AND I. FURTHERMORE IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN NINE HAS TAUGHT US. WOMEN HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF THE SO. THE SAME STRUGGLE. REFLECTING ON THE LIFE OF HER BE MELT AND AS AN ATTEMPT TO HONOR HIS LIFE. STAYING COMMITTED TO ADVANCING SOLUTIONS TO BUILD BACK BETTER IS VITAL TO ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES THAT HAVE STARKLY HELD BACK WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. THIS FLOOR IS A SMALL EXAMPLE OF THE DIVERSITY THAT MAKES UP CALIFORNIA A TRUE DEFINITION OF DIVERSE COMMUNITIES COMING TOGETHER TO HELP INDIVIDUALS OVERCOME BARRIERS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. I LIKE TO THINK THAT HARVEY MILK WOULD BE A PROUD. OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE. AND I WAS THE FIRST OPENLY GAY LGBTQ MILLENNIAL REPRESENTING MY DISTRICT I AM EXTREMELY HONORED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION TODAY COMMEMORATING HARD ENOUGH DAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT. THANK YOU MISS CERVANTES MYSTERY THAT'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IN IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN BEFORE THEIR TIME- THAT THE WORLD ISN'T READY FOR HOW THEY THINK. OR WHO THEY ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE. BUT HARVEY MILK ARRIVE JUST WHEN WE NEEDED THE MOST. AND BEFORE HE WAS GONE TOO SOON HE WAS THERE IN THE FIGHT INSPIRING A MOVEMENT NOT A MINUTE TOO LATE. HE CHALLENGE CALIFORNIA TO BLAZE A NEW TRAIL. A TRAIL BASED ON EQUALITY COMPASSION AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. CALIFORNIA IS CONSIDERED A VANGUARD STATE. AND BECAUSE THE VISIONARIES LIKE HARVEY MILK. AND I KNOW THAT THIS DIVERSE LEGISLATURE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP HARVEY'S MISSION ALIVE. WE WILL WORK TO ENSURE THAT HOPE IS NEVER EXTINGUISHED HERE IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. AND WE KNOW THAT WE STILL WORK TO DO TO ACHIEVE FULL EQUALITY. THERE ARE STILL TOO MANY L. G. B. T. CALIFORNIANS WHO FALL ASLEEP EVERY NIGHT. WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL BE ACCEPTED BY THEIR FAMILIES BY THEIR FRIENDS BY THEIR COWORKERS AND THE CLASSMATES. TOO MANY LGBT YOUTH EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AND FACE EXTREME BULLYING IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND WE KNOW THAT LGBT RESIDENTS LIVING IN RURAL PARTS OF OUR STATE. OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. L. LGBT CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN IN ALL CORNERS OF OUR STATE NORTH AND SOUTH. EAST AND WEST IN COUNTIES LARGE AND SMALL. IN EVERY TOWN AND CITY SHOULD HAVE SIMILAR SUPPORT AND RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THE GREATER URBAN AREAS OF OUR STATE. IT HARVEY MILK WAS WITH US TODAY. I FEEL HE WOULD BE LEADING EQUALITY MARCHES IN RURAL AREAS. TO MAKE SURE THAT LGBT PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. KNEW THAT BIGHTER DAYS ARE ON THE HORIZON AND THAT HOPE. IS STILL ALIVE. EVERY LGBT CALIFORNIANS SHOULD KNOW AND FEEL COMFORT HERE IN OUR STATE. THAT THEY ARE EQUAL IN ALL WAYS. AND THEY CAN LOVE ANYONE THEY WANT A LOT OF. HARVEY MILK GAVE HIS LIFE IN PURSUIT OF EQUALITY.

WITHOUT THE CLERICAL OF THE ROLE FOR COAL. THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS ON THE RESOLUTION THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS. THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS. CLARK WELL.

WE ARE MOVING BACK ONE ITEM IN THE FILE ORDER THIS IS FILE ITEM ONE OH SEVEN ONE OH SEVEN H. BAR FORTY ONE BY MR MAYES. CORPORATE HOUSE WAS LUCIEN FORTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAYES AND OTHER PHILOSOPHY HUMAN RIGHTS OF WORKERS. MR MAYS EMAIL BUT- THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO BRING FOR H. R. FORTY ONE TO STRONGLY DENOUNCED THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS COMMITTED AGAINST THE WEAKER PEOPLE. SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE ASKING WHY BRING THIS RESOLUTION FOR TODAY TO THAT OF A SIMPLE ANSWER. LIKE MANY AMERICANS I HEARD ABOUT THE POOR TREATMENT OF UIGHURS IN THE XINJIANG REGION OF CHINA. THE HOME OF UIGHURS CALL EAST TURKISTAN BUT DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN IMPACT AT THE TIME. HOWEVER TWO YEARS AGO I MET AN INDIVIDUAL WHO STORY BROUGHT THE WEAKER STRUGGLE FROM THE NEWS. INTO MY LIFE. MEMBERS THE NIGHTMARE WEAKER AMERICANS FACES WHEN YOU CANNOT WAKE UP FROM. CUT OFF FROM THEIR FAMILIES BACK HOME RELATIVES AND NEIGHBOURS VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS OF CHINESE GOVERNMENT RUN REGGIE CATION CAMPS. INTERNATIONAL REPORTS CONFIRM THE HORROR WITH DOCUMENTED CASES OF TORTURE SANCTIONED RAPE FAMILY SEPARATION ORGAN HARVESTING CULTURE REVOCATION AND DEATH. THE TREATMENT OF THESE TWO MILLION UIGHURS IS A STAIN ON THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY THAT WE MUST NOT BE SILENT ABOUT. ANSWERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT ARE SHROUDED IN LIES AND DECEIT WITH THE ONLY TRUTH BEING SMUGGLED OUT SHAKY CELLPHONE VIDEOS OF THE SPORADIC TEXT. BUT EVEN THESE GLIMMERS OF TRUTH BRING MANY FAMILIES DREAD. AS THE REALIZATION OF WHAT THEIR LOVED ONES ARE LIVING THROUGH MANIFESTS. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT OUR STATE NATION HAS NO DEMONS TO GRAPPLE WITH OURSELVES THE WRONGS WE HAVE COMMITTED IN THE PAST CANNOT PREVENT US FROM TAKING ACTION AS RUNS APPEAR BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. HUMANITY IS UNIQUE IN OUR CONTRADICTION WE EXHIBIT GREAT KINDNESS BUT CAN BE MERCILESS TO THOSE WE HATE. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY BUILD A BETTER WORLD. BUT CAN DESTROY IT IN SECONDS. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GROW FROM OUR PREDECESSORS MISTAKES IT IS THAT GROWTH IN THIS YEAR DEMANDING THE RELEASE OF TWO MILLION HUMANS BEING HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL. IN DOING SO YOU MUST NOT ATTEMPT TO RIDE OUR MORAL HIGH HORSE OVER OTHER NATIONS BUT INSTEAD. SHOW THEM THE SCARS FROM OUR OWN FAILINGS IN HOPES THEY MIGHT EMERGE UNBLEMISHED. IT IS ONLY THEN WE CAN HOPE TO WAKE UP FROM THE NIGHTMARE OCCURRING TO THE WEAKER PEOPLE. MISTER SPEAKER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND ASKED THE RULE BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS. THANK YOU MISTER MESS. MEMBERS. PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION A MISSILE OF A MICHELIN YOU'RE RECOGNIZED FOR DESK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS ESOLUTION MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS. AND AS A MEMBER OF ALL HUMANITY WHO AFTER ALL SPEAKS TODAY OF THE ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMENIANS. MEMBERS THESE WORDS WERE A DRAFT OF THE SPEECH ADOLF HITLER DELIVERED TO HIS OFFICERS ON THE EVE OF THE **** INVASION OF POLAND IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE. WE DIDN'T NEED TO WAIT FOR THIS SPEECH TO UNDERSTAND THE GENOCIDAL MANIA AT THE HEART OF IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE THE NUREMBERG RACE LAWS. STRIPPED GERMAN JEWS OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP POGROMS WERE ORGANIZED MASSACRES IN RIOTS AIMED AT ETHNIC CLEANSING AGAINST JEWS WERE COMMONPLACE IN EUROPE AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THESE PROGRAMS ARE WHAT MOTIVATED MY OWN ANCESTORS TO FLEE TO AMERICA. AND IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT KRISTALLNACHT THE NIGHT OF BROKEN GLASS WAS A **** PARTY SPONSORED PROGRAM THAT DESTROYED THE HOMES BUSINESSES SYNAGOGUES AND SCHOOLS OF JEWISH GERMANS. THAT NIGHT. JEWS AND SENT THEM TO GHETTOS WHERE THEY WERE SLOWLY MURDERED THREE STARVATION. BEFORE THEIR LIVES WHOEVER SURVIVED THE GHETTOS BEFORE THOSE LIVES WERE EVENTUALLY LIQUIDATED IN GAS CHAMBERS AND THEIR BODIES BURNED IN OVENS IN THE HOLOCAUST THAT FORMALLY BOOK BEGAN IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND TOOK ELEVEN MILLION INNOCENT LIVES. ULTIMATELY WE LEARNED THAT NO ONE WAS WILLING TO SAVE JEWISH LIVES THEY LOOK DIFFERENT THEY SPOKE A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THEY PRAYED DIFFERENTLY LET'S FACE IT IN THE FACE OF ANNIHILATION OR ATTACKS. NO ONE STICKS UP FOR JEWS AND TOO FREQUENTLY ANYONE ELSE WHO IS OTHER LIKE READERS. IT'S GRUESOME. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE WORLD HISTORY OF INACTION. IT'S IMPORTANT NO OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY OF INACTION EVEN WHEN IT KNOWS OF THREATS TO MINORITIES. AND WE KNEW IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE BETWEEN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE BETWEEN THE NUREMBERG RACE LAWS IN THE HOLOCAUST WE GET BEGINNING IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE GERMANY HOSTED THE OLYMPICS IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX HITLER. SAW THE GAMES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE HIS GOVERNMENT AND IDEALS OF RACIAL SUPREMACY AND ANTI SEMITISM AND THE OFFICIAL JEWS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GAMES. JEWISH ATHLETES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN SIDELINED JUST TO AVOID OFFENDING THE **** REGIME. NO MEMBERS THIS ISN'T HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY I AM RISING TO SPEAK OUT FOR THE RIGHTS OF UIGHURS IN XINJIANG IT'S IN FAR EASTERN CHINA IF YOU NEED HELP FINDING IT. ON A MAP THEIR MUSLIM. AND AGAIN THEY'RE REALLY FAR AWAY FROM ANYTHING- BUT WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT CHINA'S PERSECUTION OF UIGHURS FOR YEARS. WE HAVE SATELLITE IMAGERY. DOCUMENTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT NOW MILLIONS OF WOMEN AND MEN ARE INCARCERATED IN SLAVE CAMPS. AS I SHARED WITH YOU LAST WEEK WOMEN HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY STERILIZED TWO PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE HAD SECRETARIES OF STATE WARREN OF GENOCIDE. THERE IS A GLOBAL DEMAND FOR BLACK HAIR AND TONS OF IT HAD BEEN DETAINED BY CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL SUSPECTED OF COMING FROM WEAKER HEADS ARRIVING IN AMERICA IN THE FORM. OF WEAVES AND WIGS. THIRTEEN TONS JUST LAST JULY. IF YOU HAVE EVER THOUGHT IF YOU AGREE THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS PLEASE DON'T LET THAT JUST BE A SLOGAN. THIS IS YOUR BECAUSE RIGHT HERE. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS DON'T LET THAT JUST BE A TWEET THIS IS YOUR FIGHT RIGHT HERE FOR UIGHUR WOMEN AND MEN. MAKE YOUR VOTE COUNT FOR SOMETHING. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION BUT WE MUST DO MORE. THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS NOTHING. THIS RESOLUTION IS THE EASIEST THING THAT WE CAN DO THE EASIEST. IT WASHES AWAY OUR GUILT OVER INACTION. WE MUST DO MORE WE CAN'T JUST LET THIS CONTINUE. AND GUESS WHO'S HOSTING THE WINTER OLYMPICS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO THIRTY SECONDS CHINA. EVERY VOTE YOU TAKE MEMBERS EVERY VOTE EVERY TIME YOU CONSIDER AN ISSUE THAT INVOLVES CHINA PLEASE MAKE YOUR VOTE MEAN SOMETHING PLEASE MAKE YOUR VOTE COUNT FOR SOMETHING LET'S NOT BE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT THE PAST. THANK YOU MR LEVINE. MISTER NAZARIAN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES FIRST OF ALL I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR FORTY ONE AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM SPRINGS FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE- COUPLE OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN VERY ELOQUENTLY DETAILING. SOME OF THE ATROCITIES THAT WE ARE FINDING OUT ABOUT. COLLEAGUES BY THE TIME WE ACTUALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IT'S TOO LATE. TOO MANY LIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST. WE KNOW THIS THROUGH HISTORY. WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE UNRAVEL THINGS AFTER YEARS OF HAPPENING. IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE. AND POLITICS WHEN POLITICS GETS INVOLVED AND MAKES A FORCEFUL DECISION. IT'S ALREADY WAY TOO LATE. SO IF THERE'S ANY HOPE OF MAKING A DIFFERENCE NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO BE THAT BEACON OF LIGHT THAT STARTS MAKING AN IMPACT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS TO YOU. A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WAS BEING PERPETRATED. AND SYSTEMICALLY BEING CONDUCTED. THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS NOT GOING TO KNOW IF IT WASN'T FOR THE ACT OF A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE. ONE WAS THE US AMBASSADOR. HENRY MORGENTHAU. WHO ON A DAILY BASIS WROTE ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND WAS NOTIFYING THE REST OF THE WORLD. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE DOCUMENTATION THAT HE PROVIDED MOST OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE BEEN LOST OR JUST BEEN HERE SAY. BUT THERE ARE STATE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTS OF WHAT HAPPENED. SECOND WAS THE GERMAN OFFICER BY THE NAME OF ARMIN WAGNER. GERMANS WERE COLLABORATE TURKEY WAS COLLABORATING WITH GERMANY AND FOR IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR GERMANS OFFICERS WERE SENT TO ACTUALLY HELP. WITH THE PERSECUTION AND THE GENOCIDE OF ARMENIANS.

WE HAVE SPENT TIME ON THIS FLOOR A LOT OF TIME RECENTLY TALKING ABOUT GENOCIDE THAT WERE COMMITTED IN THE PAST. TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO. COMMEMORATE AND UNDERSTAND THOSE GENOCIDES THE NEED TO TEACH ABOUT THEM TO BUILD MEMORIALS TO THEM. BUT PART OF THAT PURPOSE IS TO PREVENT GENOCIDE FROM HAPPENING AGAIN TO ANYONE WHETHER THAT IS PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY OR AN ETHNIC MUSLIM MINORITY IN CHINA WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. AGAIN WE HAVE AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SAID TO. TWO TWO ADMINISTRATIONS A DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES THAT HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS A GENOCIDE TAKING PLACE. I READ AN ARTICLE RECENTLY IN THE BBC ABOUT THE SYSTEMATIC FORCED RAPE OF UIGHUR WOMEN IN CUSTODY IT IS AMONG THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS THAT I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE. SO I WANT TO COMMEND OUR COLLEAGUE FROM YUCCA VALLEY FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE THAT WE SET TODAY.

ALTHOUGH THE TERM ALIEN HAS HISTORICALLY REFERRED TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NON CITIZENS. THE WORD WAS SINCE HAS SINCE BEEN WEAPONIZED AND USED IN PLACE OF AN EXPLICITLY RACIAL SLUR. THERE IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN WORDS AND ACTIONS AND HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT DEHUMANIZING LANGUAGE OFTEN PRECEDES VILE ACTIONS WE HAVE ALL WITNESSED THE HORRIFIC INCREASE IN CRIMES. IN THIS YEAR ALONE THERE HAVE BEEN OVER THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED HATE CRIMES TOWARDS OUR API COMMUNITY AND OTHER VIOLENT ATTACKS TOWARD OTHER COMMUNITIES.

ONE LIKE ARE CALLING FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY MENTIONED WORDS MATTER. WORDS ARE POWERFUL INSTRUMENTS. THEY CAN DEEPLY INFLUENCE OUR BEHAVIOR AND THE WAY THAT WE TREAT EACH OTHER. AND THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH HATEFUL AND DEHUMANIZING RHETORIC DIRECTED TOWARDS OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN RECENT YEARS. IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE THOUGHTFUL AND INTENTIONAL AND INCLUSIVE IN THE WAY THAT WE- WRITE OUR LAWS. AND SECOND WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT ARE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR FRIENDS AND OUR NEIGHBORS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VITAL MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILIES. AND OUR COMMUNITIES.

A NEW OWNER BROUGHT THIS PARK AND- SADLY HAS INCREASED THE RENTS UP 220% FOR SOME AND NOW EVEN CLOSE 240% THESE PARK RENTERS ARE SENIORS VETERANS. THESE PEOPLE HAVE WORKED HARD THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AND MANY OF THEM BOUGHT THIS MOBILE HOME. AS THEIR FOREVER HOME THEY'RE ON FIXED INCOMES. AND THERE RENTS HAVE INCREASED FROM SOME THAT WERE CLOSE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO NOW ALMOST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS SIMPLY MEANS THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT THEY'RE ON FIXED INCOMES. AND TALKING TO THESE CONSTITUENTS OF MINE THEY HAVE SAID THAT SOME OF THEM ARE NOT ONLY GETTING SICK BECAUSE OF THE STRESS. THEY'VE ENTERED POVEDA AND NOW THEY'RE EVEN LINED UP FOR FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS AND- PUTTING THEIR MEDICATIONS ON HOLD BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MEDICATION. OR RENT. THIS BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED FROM A STATE WIDE. MOBILE HOME RENT STABILIZATION BILL TO THIS PARTICULAR PARK. AS WE KNOW WE ARE SEEING MANY INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES APARTMENTS AND EVEN MOBILE HOMES AND THIS BILL WOULD DO THE LEAST WHICH IS TO HELP KEEP THESE PEOPLE HOUSE.

OR TOY I MAKE THE ASSUMPTION IS A MOM THAT THAT TOY IS SAFE FOR MY CHILD BECAUSE I AM BUYING IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE I ASSUME WE HAVE HIGH STANDARDS FOR SAFETY. BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED FOR MANY YEARS THIS CARCINOGENIC CLASS OF CHEMICALS BEING FEE FOSS. TO BE USED ON. THE ON THE HUMAN BEINGS WHOSE BODIES ARE AT THE MOMENT OF DEVELOPMENT WHEN THEY ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO CARCINOGENIC MATERIALS. NOW WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS BECAUSE THESE CHEMICALS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THESE PRODUCTS. WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING NECESSARILY ABOUT ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS FOR THE CHEMICAL CERTAINLY ARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO MATTRESSES TO TOYS. TO TEDDY BEARS AND YET THEY ARE ROUTINELY USED ON THOSE PRODUCTS. EVEN THOUGH THOSE CHEMICALS ARE BANNED OUTRIGHT IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE OF THEIR CARCINOGENIC MATERIAL. MEMBERS IT IS TIME THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA SAY. THAT WE PUT THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN. PARAMOUNT TO ANY OTHER CONCERN THAT WE HAVE. AND FORBID THE USE OF P. FOSS ON JUVENILE PRODUCTS A MEMBERS THE INDUSTRY.
