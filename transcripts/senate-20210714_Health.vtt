MEMBERS- SENATOR RUBIO. THANK

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:49.200
YOU MR CHAIR AND I WANNA THANK

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:51.869

IN OPPOSITION AND OFTEN SUPPORT

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:56.707
I THINK THIS IS A- VERY

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:58.309
IMPORTANT ISSUE TO DISCUSS SOME

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:58.909
DOUBT THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:01.479
THEIR THOUGHTS AND- ON I DO.

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:03.614
ACTUALLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.583
THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THE

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.118
INCREASES I KNOW MAYBE NOT AS

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.886
IT PERTAINS TO THIS BILL. BUT

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.321
COLLECTIVELY I KNOW THERE'S

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:12.657
BEEN A LOT OF MANDATES- HOWEVER

00:38:12.723 --> 00:38:14.859
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:16.927
WE CAN ALL AGREE IS A SERIOUS

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:19.664
ONE. I WAS ONE OF THE- CALLERS

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.299
NOTED OF SOME OF THE-

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:23.601
INDIVIDUALS ARE HAVING TO

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.670
RATION THEIR INSULIN. THEY'RE

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.071
HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:29.407
HEALTH AND PAYING THEIR BILLS

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:31.842
AND JUST. BASED ON THE COST OF

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:32.943
INSULIN I THINK IT'S JUST

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.312
UNACCEPTABLE. THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:36.647
CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR HEALTH IS

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:38.416
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS PAYING A

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.651
BILL SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:42.620
THE BILL I ALSO WANT TO BE

00:38:42.687 --> 00:38:44.588
ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. I THINK

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:45.923
THIS IS SUCH A LIFE SAVING

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.092
MEDICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.760
ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE TO

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.529
PEOPLE THAT NEED IT. AS THE

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:52.863
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTED THE

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.765
COST OF BRAND NAME INSULIN

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:57.768
NEARLY TRIPLED BETWEEN TWENTY

00:38:57.835 --> 00:38:58.502
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND- TWENTY

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:02.807
EIGHTEEN. AND NO ONE HAS TO.

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:04.809
LEE- SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:06.377
JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:08.012
THE MEDICATION I ALSO READ

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:10.581
ANOTHER STUDY BY UCLA HEALTH

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:13.284
WHICH NOTED THAT THE MAJORITY

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.953
OF CALIFORNIANS ADULTS NOW HAVE

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.888
DIABETES OR PRE DIABETES AND SO

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.190
AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER ALL OF

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:21.125
US WHO MAY HAVE IT AND AGAIN

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.560
OVER FOURTEEN OTHER STATES

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:23.928
INCLUDING WASHINGTON DC HAVE

00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:25.730
ALREADY MADE ADVANCES IN THIS

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:28.833
PARTICULAR ARENA- ESPECIALLY

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:30.167
BECAUSE WE KEEP HEARING OF THE

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:31.769
PRICES GOING UP AND I THINK

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:33.704
THAT LIMITING THE OUT OF POCKET

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:34.538
COSTS FOR INSULIN WILL HELP SO

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:36.340
MANY OF OUR- DISADVANTAGED

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:37.441
COMMUNITIES AND I THINK IT'S

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:38.909
IMPORTANT THAT WE STAND BEHIND

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:40.277
THIS IT WOULD NOT ONLY HELP

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:42.046
THOSE. CURRENTLY ARE NEEDING

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.681
THE INSULIN BUT SOME OF US AT

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:46.484
ME IN THE FUTURE- FALL YOU KNOW

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.018

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.520

THIS BILL FORWARD I WANT TO

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.895
ECHO ALL OF THE COMMENTS MADE

00:39:57.962 --> 00:40:00.531
BY MY- COLLEAGUE AND ALSO I

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:02.233
WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT CHILDREN

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:03.834
WHO NEED INSULIN AND- AS A

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:05.970
PARENT I CAN'T IMAGINE. HOW

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:07.905
AWFUL IT WOULD BE. TO KNOW THAT

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:09.006
YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR CHILD'S

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:10.207
LIFE IN DANGER BECAUSE YOU

00:40:10.274 --> 00:40:12.176
COULD NOT AFFORD. THIS LIFE

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:14.378
SAVING MEDICATION AND CHILDREN

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.846
ARE PRETTY MUCH BORN WITH

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.414
DIABETES SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:19.850
DID SOMETHING TO. TO MAKE THIS

00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:21.819
HAPPEN. I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:23.120
HEALTH PLANS ARE COMING FROM

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:24.588
BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THIS

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:27.391
OUT WE CANNOT CONTINUE. TO LET

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:29.994
PEOPLE DIE FROM A DISEASE THAT

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.796
OUT THAT WE KNOW IS MANAGEABLE

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:32.663
WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.398
CAN AFFORD THE MEDICATION SO I

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:35.366
LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:39.537
BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. S. C. NO

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:40.571

FLOOR- SO SOMEWHERE IN THIS

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.308
AREA AND- FIRST OF ALL I DO

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:44.909
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.644
BILL FORWARD I ACTUALLY ONE

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.711
ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS FOR

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.079
MY TWO COLLEAGUES WHO ARE.

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:50.681
CURRENTLY PRESENTS FOR YOUR-

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:52.817
FOR THE PRESENTATION. I THINK

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:54.952
THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR ME

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.220
AND AGAIN I ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.922
THINK. YOU'RE PUTTING IT FOR

00:40:57.988 --> 00:40:59.056
THE GOOD POLICY AND ALL THE

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.257
REASONS THAT YOUR WITNESSES

00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:01.659
BROUGHT UP AND WHAT- MY

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:02.459
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID RIGHT WE

SHOULDN'T- THIS IS A LIFE YOU

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:05.830
KNOW IN SOMEONE'S LIFE SAVING

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:08.098
DRUG- THAT DEDUCTIBLE WHICH

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:10.000
WILL BE ELIMINATING IN THIS.

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:11.869
BILL IS A BARRIER TO PEOPLE

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:13.137
GETTING ACCESS TO IT WE DON'T

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:14.839
WANT PEOPLE TO STOP NOT TAKING

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:16.640
THEIR INSULIN. AND ENDING UP IN

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:17.842
THE HOSPITAL OR NAMIBIA

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.276
MERCHANTS IN THE HOSPITAL OR

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.711
EVEN DYING AS A RESULT OF THAT

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.613
AND I. REALLY APPRECIATE THE

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.249
SENTIMENTS BEHIND THE BILL. THE

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.251
I GUESS THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:29.053
AND WE HAD A SIMILAR BILL HERE

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.054
THAT WE PASS OUT THIS COMMITTEE

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.323
AS WELL. IS THAT IT'S NOT THE

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:34.024
ONLY DRUG OR CONDITIONAL WEIRD

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:36.126
THIS IS ALSO THE CIRCUMSTANCE

00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:39.797
WE HAVE OTHER- CONDITIONS WHERE

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.098
WE HAVE YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.700
SIMILAR AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT IT

00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:44.568
IS THE DUCK DOUBLE THE-

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.136
PATIENTS CAN'T AFFORD IT. THEY

00:41:46.203 --> 00:41:47.705
STOP TAKING THE MEDICATION THEY

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.373
END UP IN THE HOSPITAL OR

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:55.312
EMERGENCY ROOM. JUST LIKE- IT'S-

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:56.714
WITH THAT WITH THE DIVING. SO

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.982
THE DEFINITELY CHECK FOR ME. IS

00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:05.189
THAT- I REALLY APPRECIATE. THIS

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:07.358
THEY DEFINITELY NEED THIS THE

00:42:07.424 --> 00:42:08.192
QUESTION IS WHY DO WHAT

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:09.727
EVERYONE ELSE IS IN A SIMILAR

00:42:09.793 --> 00:42:11.395
SITUATION JUST BUT THEY DON'T

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:12.696
HAVE DIABETES HAVE A DIFFERENT

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:15.232
DISEASE AND- AND I DO KNOW

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:17.902
THAT- THE- YOU KNOW THE HEALTH

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.236
PLANS HAVE TALKED ABOUT NOT

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:20.971
HAVING A DISEASE BY DISEASE

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:23.674
APPROACH ALL RIGHT- SO WHAT WE

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:25.276
DON'T WANT TO HAVE AS WE PASS

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.044
THIS BILL WE HAVE THIS AND THEN

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.445
SOMEONE LIKE HAS ANOTHER

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:29.947
DISEASE GROUP AND DON'T THEY OF

00:42:30.014 --> 00:42:31.015
COURSE NEED IT AND THEN THEN

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:32.516
IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ITSELF

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:33.884
BUT EACH DISEASE AND EACH SET

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:34.885
OF DRUGS WE HAVE A SLIGHTLY

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:36.787
DIFFERENT. CO PAY DEDUCTIBLE

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:38.455
WHATEVER ITS INTERESTS THAT WE

00:42:38.522 --> 00:42:39.590
HAVE TO NOW WITH THIS KIND OF

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.358
LIKE DIFFERENT PATTERNS AND

00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:43.360
THAT ALSO PERHAPS ALSO DEPENDS

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:44.561
ON YOU KNOW WHICH DISEASES HAVE

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:45.562
ENOUGH PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:46.897
BOUNCE YOU KNOW EFFORT THROUGH

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:48.766
THE LEGISLATURE RATES OF YOU

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:49.366
HAVE A DISEASE THAT'S EITHER

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:53.470
RARER YOUR PEOPLE ARE- PERHAPS

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:54.538
YOU KNOW IT'S MORE PREVALENT IN

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:56.040
A MUCH SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:42:56.106 --> 00:42:57.441
PERHAPS A MINORITY GROUPS

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:58.442
THERE'S A LET YOU KNOW THE

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.778
POLITICAL WILL- THE ABILITY OF

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:03.213
THE BILLION MOBILE ICE IS THOSE

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.715
LAST AND SO FORTH SO THEY DON'T

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:06.250
GET THERE BUT THE OTHER ONES

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.151
TOO SO THAT I THINK THAT'S THE

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:09.353
CHALLENGE. THAT THAT THAT THAT

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.655
THAT I'M FACING- I'D TRY

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:14.892
PERHAPS YOU CAN ADDRESS- WHY

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:16.627
ONLY DIABETES I'D SEE I THINK

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.162
IT'S QUITE EVIDENT MY DIABETES

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:19.263
NEEDS IT GREAT SO I THINK

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.597
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE IT'S LIKE

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.333
WHY ONLY DIABETES- WOULD BE

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:25.970
HELPFUL TO HEAR- BUT- CERTAINLY

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:28.405
I AM NOT AND IT YOU KNOW I'M

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:30.874
NOT ASKING MY COLLEAGUES NOT TO

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:32.009
VOTE FOR THE BILL BECAUSE OF

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:33.010
THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:34.345
IDEA COMMITTEE NEEDS IT RIGHT

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:36.347
AND I WANTED AND I AND I AND I

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:37.748
REALLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:38.349
SAYING THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE

00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:44.688
VOTING FOR THE BILL- MY ISSUE

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:45.389
IS THAT. THERE'S OTHER. AS WELL.

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.290
AS YOU KNOW ARE WE GONNA. IT

00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:47.591
EASY LIKE THIS APPROACH AND

00:43:47.658 --> 00:43:48.559
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE WHO

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:49.793
ARE LEFT OUT WHO CAN'T MOBILIZE

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.662
A BILL- HEARING SO DON'T THEY

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.797
DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS.

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:55.265
RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT'S

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:56.567
THE- THAT WAS BEHIND THE

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:59.636
LEGISLATION THAT I. AUTHORED

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:01.338
BUT CERTAINLY HOPING TO WORK

00:44:01.405 --> 00:44:02.306
WITH YOU AND MAYBE THERE'S

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:03.741
APPROACH WE CAN WORK TOGETHER

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:04.775
AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.443
LARGER ISSUE SO I REALLY

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.911
APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY FOR

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:08.445
THE DIABETIC COMMUNITY BUT

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.447
HOPEFULLY. ALSO BOTH YOU AND

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:11.982
THE SPONSOR TO THAT IT CAN YOU

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:12.516
CAN SEE WHY IT MIGHT BE

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.485
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT. IT WE

00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:16.587
SHOULD DO SOMETHING BROADER-

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:17.855
THAT SO THAT ANYONE WHO'S IN

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:19.156
THIS KIND OF SITUATION WHERE

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:20.624
THERE'S A LIFE SAVING DRUG LIKE

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:22.092
INSULIN. LIKE INSULIN THAT

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.328
NEEDS THAT. IT FOR OTHER

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:25.896
CONDITIONS AS WELL. THAT'S A

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.798
STANDARD. THAT DAN ANYONE WHO

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.299
HAS A CONDITION LIKE THAT WHERE

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:29.933
THERE'S A TREATMENT THAT WOULD

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.668
SAVE THEIR LIVES. WOULD THEN BE

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:33.404
ABLE TO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:34.838
FINANCIAL BARRIERS. FROM THEM

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:36.073
SO AGAIN APPRECIATE YOU

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.042

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:40.144
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION- PCT

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.545
ADVOCACY FROM THE DIABETIC

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:46.483
COMMUNITY- AND- WITH THAT-

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.117
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK

YOU. FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS

00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:52.890
SPACE AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:54.958
THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ALSO HEAR

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:59.263
THE BILL PREVENTS THE BILL- AND

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.265
FOUR IT'LL- MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:03.867
STEP. OF THAT I COULDN'T AGREE

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:06.003
WITH YOU MORE. I AND I WAS

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.805

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:08.906
SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS AS

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:12.009
WELL. SO I DO LOOK FORWARD TO

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:14.211
WORKING WITH YOU. ON ANY

00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:16.613
OPPORTUNITY IN ADVANCING MORE-

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.982
MORE CHRONIC DISEASES SO THAT-

00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:20.684
WE ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:23.087
ECONOMIES OF SCALE- IF WE'RE

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:26.090
DOING IT FOR ONE WE CAN DO IT

00:45:26.156 --> 00:45:28.592
FOR MULTIPLE ONES- IS THE

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:29.927
REASON WHY I STARTED WORKING

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.795
SPECIFICALLY IN THE DIABETIC.

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:34.364
SPACE IS BECAUSE WHEN I AM AS

00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:36.567
MATIC. AND WHEN I SAW THAT I

00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:40.370
DON'T HAVE A CO PAY. ON SOME OF

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:42.372
THE MEDICATION THAT I USE. AND

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:43.874
I SAW THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN

00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:46.844
DIFFERENT DISEASES SOME

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:47.377
CHILDREN ARE AS MATIC THEY

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.980
DON'T. TELL TO SOME THINGS ARE

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:51.949
BETTER AFFORDED TO THEM SOME

00:45:52.015 --> 00:45:54.184
KIDS ARE DIABETIC BUT THE SAME

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.552
OPPORTUNITY DOESN'T EXIST FOR

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:57.421
THEM I JUST FELT THAT IT WAS

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:58.755
SOMETHING THAT NEEDED TO BE

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:01.959
ADDRESSED. AND SO I WANTED TO

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.161
MOVE THIS AND I'VE BEEN WORKING

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:06.697
ON IT WITH YOU FOR THE PAST

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:09.500
SOME TIME NOW- BUT THIS THIS IS

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:12.035
NOT A REFLECTION OF ANY OTHER

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:13.270
ISSUES I. AND I ALSO WANT TO

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:16.473
JUST. MENTIONED THAT GIVEN ALSO

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:17.341
WHAT SOME OF THE SENATORS HAVE

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.776
SAID A PART OF THE CHALLENGE

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:23.347
ALSO IS THAT- WITH A GROWING

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:25.682
POPULATION OF DIABETICS WE ALSO

00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:27.651
I'M JUST TRYING TO ANTICIPATE.

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:28.952
WHAT SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.053
GOING TO BE AND IF WE CAN

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.689
HOPEFULLY MAINTAIN. OR CONTAIN

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:34.324
COSTS IN SOME WAYS THAT THIS

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:36.660
WOULD BE ONE WAY THAT THE END

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:38.028
USERS WERE PAID LESS SO WITH

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:40.164

YET SO WE CAN'T- TAKE A MOTION

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.104
OR TAKE IT UP YET BUT AS SOON

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:48.639

DEATH. FIFTY ONE EYES AND

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.697
BUREAUCRACY WISE. NATURAL

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.265
ORGANIC PRODUCTION WOULD WORK

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:32.234
VERY MUCH. LIKE CREMATION.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.402

CREMATED REMAINS. AFTER

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:51.086
CREMATION. THE FACILITIES WOULD

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.020

THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS HOW'S

02:06:26.145 --> 02:06:26.912
THAT GOING TO BE USED MOST

TALKING ABOUT THAT COULD BE

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:01.926
POTENTIALLY USED FOR THAT IS

02:30:01.992 --> 02:30:03.728
THAT THE ONLY FUNDING SOURCE.

02:30:03.794 --> 02:30:05.463

02:30:23.013 --> 02:30:25.316
AT DIFFERENT COUNTY PARTS OF

02:30:25.383 --> 02:30:26.684
RESOURCES INCLUDING THEIR

02:30:26.751 --> 02:30:28.819
COUNTY GENERAL FUND INCLUDING

02:30:28.886 --> 02:30:31.489

THEIR COUNTY ALLOCATION FOR

02:30:32.556 --> 02:30:34.825
THIS OPIOID SETTLEMENT THAT'S A

02:30:34.892 --> 02:30:37.261
PIECE BUT- THE TOURNEY I MEAN

02:30:37.328 --> 02:30:38.262
SORRY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

02:30:39.563 --> 02:30:40.898
GETTING A PHILANTHROPY AND

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:42.700
OTHERS TO LOOK AT IT BUT- ISN'T

02:30:42.767 --> 02:30:44.602
IT IT'S NOT AT ALL THROUGH THE

02:30:44.668 --> 02:30:46.003
STATE THAT WERE CERTAINLY WORK

02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:48.305
WORK WE ARE AUTHORIZING THIS TO

02:30:48.372 --> 02:30:49.173
HAPPEN IN STATE LAW THE

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:51.575
SENTENCING. STRUCTURE TO WORK

02:30:51.642 --> 02:30:53.711
AND IT'S UP TO THEM TO FIND IT

02:30:53.778 --> 02:30:55.546
OKAY ANNA AND JUST ONE FINAL

02:30:55.613 --> 02:30:57.548
MORE OF A COMMON I GUESS I'M

02:30:57.615 --> 02:30:59.049
SURE THERE'S A FINE STUDENT

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:06.891
THAT SEX DEDERT UC DAVIS-

02:31:06.957 --> 02:31:07.491
PERHAPS. WHO COULD DO SOME. TO

02:31:07.558 --> 02:31:08.125
DO SOME EVALUATE OF THIS THINK

02:31:08.192 --> 02:31:08.759
IT'S GOING BE THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:31:08.826 --> 02:31:09.260
THINGS THERE'S NOT A LOT

02:31:09.326 --> 02:31:10.761
EVIDENCE. DEVICE OF THE

02:31:10.828 --> 02:31:11.529
EFFECTIVENESS OF A LOCKED

02:31:11.595 --> 02:31:13.898
FACILITY- SO I THINK IF WE'RE

02:31:13.964 --> 02:31:14.999
GONNA GET A PILOT THAT SHOULD

02:31:15.065 --> 02:31:16.600
BE GOOD TO. TO START GATHERING

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:18.536
THAT INITIAL DATA ABOUT BLINK

02:31:18.602 --> 02:31:20.271
THE STAY HOW LONG PEOPLE STAY

02:31:20.337 --> 02:31:21.906
WHAT WHAT THE- THE ACTUAL

02:31:21.972 --> 02:31:23.674
TREATMENT WILL BE AND THEN THE

02:31:23.741 --> 02:31:25.443
EFFECTIVENESS OF IT AFTER.

02:31:25.509 --> 02:31:27.211
POSTING THAT'S A GOOD IDEA WHO-

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:29.413
OF MAYBE IN THE NEXT FEW CLEAR

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:30.748
TODAY THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS

02:31:30.815 --> 02:31:31.549
PROCESS WE COULD PUT IN THERE

02:31:31.615 --> 02:31:34.185
SOME TYPE OF. A MANDATED

02:31:34.251 --> 02:31:35.753
EVALUATION PROCESS. OKAY THANK

MR CHAIRMAN. SO I WHEN I FIRST

02:31:43.127 --> 02:31:45.563
SAW THIS SO I HAD MY CONCERNS

02:31:45.629 --> 02:31:47.331
ABOUT IT- FOR THE REASONS

02:31:47.398 --> 02:31:49.800
ARTICULATED BY THE OPPOSITION I

02:31:49.867 --> 02:31:52.436
HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS BEFORE

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:53.404
THIS CAME TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:31:53.471 --> 02:31:56.006
COMMITTEE WITH THE AUTHOR- I

02:31:56.073 --> 02:31:58.909
ALSO HAD. VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS

02:31:58.976 --> 02:32:00.544
WITH THE OPPONENTS TO NUMBER

02:32:00.611 --> 02:32:02.213
THREE MORE IN MY DISTRICT IN

02:32:02.279 --> 02:32:03.814
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE VERY

02:32:03.881 --> 02:32:05.916
CLOSE WITH AND WORK WITH VERY

02:32:05.983 --> 02:32:07.785
VERY CLOSELY ON VARIOUS.

02:32:07.852 --> 02:32:10.654
PROGRESSIVE DRUG POLICY.

02:32:10.721 --> 02:32:12.456
APPROACHES TOWARDS ENDING THE

02:32:12.523 --> 02:32:13.691
WAR ON DRUGS IN TREATING DRUGS

02:32:13.757 --> 02:32:15.793
AS A HEALTH ISSUE. NOT A

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:18.896
CRIMINAL ISSUE- AND SO- I

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:21.599
ULTIMATELY IN PUBLIC SAFETY. WE

02:32:21.665 --> 02:32:22.366
HAD A VERY VERY PRODUCTIVE

02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:25.836
HEARING- AND- HOW LONG COLLOQUY

02:32:25.903 --> 02:32:28.606
BETWEEN AMONG ME AND THE AUTHOR

02:32:28.672 --> 02:32:30.808
AND THE- AND THE SPONSOR. ON

02:32:30.875 --> 02:32:33.244
ABOUT. WAYS THAT THE BILL COULD

02:32:33.310 --> 02:32:35.646
BE REALLY TIGHT END. AND A

02:32:35.713 --> 02:32:38.182
NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. THAT WERE

02:32:38.249 --> 02:32:39.583
WORKED ON BY THE TWO COMMITTEES

02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:41.418
COLLABORATIVELY CAME OUT OF

02:32:41.485 --> 02:32:43.120
THAT DISCUSSION CENTER COM

02:32:43.187 --> 02:32:45.322
LONGER WAS ALSO INVOLVED. IN

02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:47.157
NARCOTIC WE- TO MAKE SURE THE

02:32:47.224 --> 02:32:49.293
FIRST ONE NO ONE EVER WOULD

02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:52.563
SPEND MORE MORE TIME- IF THEY

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:55.299
DO THIS DIVERSION- THAN THEY

02:32:55.366 --> 02:32:56.066
WOULD UNDER THEIR EXISTING

02:32:56.133 --> 02:32:58.602
SENTENCE- AND THAT INCLUDES THE

02:32:58.669 --> 02:32:59.336
CREDITS THAT THEY WOULD BE

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:01.639
ENTITLED TO. IF THEY WENT

02:33:01.705 --> 02:33:02.039
THROUGH THE NORMAL

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:04.208
INCARCERATION PROCESS- IN

02:33:04.275 --> 02:33:06.310
ADDITION WE ARE HAVING STRENGTH

02:33:06.377 --> 02:33:08.345
AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT A

02:33:08.412 --> 02:33:11.749
MEDICAL- PERSONAL PHYSICIAN

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:13.651
WOULD ALTERNATELY MAKE THE

02:33:13.717 --> 02:33:15.786
DECISION IS NOT UP TO A JUDGE.

02:33:15.853 --> 02:33:16.887
TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF

02:33:16.954 --> 02:33:19.290
TREATMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND SO

02:33:19.356 --> 02:33:20.758
I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO.

02:33:20.824 --> 02:33:22.960
TIGHTEN UP THE BILL. ON THIS IS

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:26.030
IT IS A HARD ISSUE- AND THE WAY

02:33:26.096 --> 02:33:28.899
WE'VE APPROACHED. BY DRUG USE

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:30.801
AND ADDICTION OVER THE LAST

02:33:30.868 --> 02:33:31.802
FIFTY YEARS HAS BEEN ABYSMAL

02:33:31.869 --> 02:33:34.071
FAILURE THAT WE'VE TAKEN THE

02:33:34.138 --> 02:33:37.174
APPROACH THAT IF WE JUST ARREST-PEOPLE. ACROSS THREE PEOPLE TO

02:33:37.241 --> 02:33:38.309
SOMEHOW STOP USING DRUGS

02:33:38.375 --> 02:33:39.977
WITHOUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED

02:33:40.044 --> 02:33:41.845
IT'S ONLY GOTTEN WORSE. NOW WE

02:33:41.912 --> 02:33:42.479
HAVE TO TAKE A HEALTHIER

02:33:42.546 --> 02:33:44.481
APPROACH. BUT I ALSO THINK

02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:47.384
THERE IS SPACE. FOR LIMITED

02:33:47.451 --> 02:33:49.653
PILOT PROGRAMS- NO FANCY-

02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:51.555
ACCOUNT IT'S NOT A SMALL COUNTY

02:33:51.622 --> 02:33:52.957
BUT IT'S NOT LA COUNTY OR

02:33:53.023 --> 02:33:54.992
ALAMEDA COUNTY IT'S A SMALLER

02:33:55.059 --> 02:34:01.765
COUNTY- WONDERFUL COUNTY A

02:34:01.832 --> 02:34:02.399
SMALL COUNTY. WHERE THEY TAKE A

02:34:02.466 --> 02:34:02.967
LOOK AND SEE IF THIS. MAYBE

02:34:03.033 --> 02:34:04.368
IT'LL BE UNTIL FELL. AND THEN

02:34:04.435 --> 02:34:05.970
THE PILOT. EXPIRE BUT MAYBE FOR

02:34:06.036 --> 02:34:09.340
SOME PEOPLE. WHO ARE ALREADY.

02:34:09.406 --> 02:34:11.542
GOING TO BE HERE. ARE ALREADY

02:34:11.609 --> 02:34:14.411
GOING TO BE INCARCERATED HAVE

02:34:14.478 --> 02:34:14.945
COMMITTED A CRIME AND NON

02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:16.847
VIOLENT CRIME. AND THIS GIVES

02:34:16.914 --> 02:34:18.816
THEM AN OPTION AND I KNOW MY

02:34:18.882 --> 02:34:19.750
FRIENDS DISAGREE WITH ME ON

02:34:19.817 --> 02:34:22.853
THIS- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT. AS

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:27.257
THE BILL HAS EVOLVED I THINK IT

02:34:27.324 --> 02:34:27.858
IS WORTHY OF SUPPORT AND I'LL

02:34:27.925 --> 02:34:30.027

ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL CONTINUING

02:34:50.347 --> 02:34:51.615

02:34:51.682 --> 02:34:54.184

PILOT PROGRAMS SO I YOU KNOW MY

02:39:28.825 --> 02:39:29.693

TRY. TO SEE IF IT DOES WORK-

02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:38.869

02:41:44.995 --> 02:41:46.797
SAID RELATED TRYING THAT

02:41:46.863 --> 02:41:49.166
UNFORTUNATELY- THAT. NEEDS

02:41:49.232 --> 02:41:50.700
UPDATING WE CAN'T LET THEM GO

02:41:50.767 --> 02:41:53.070
FREE AND SOCIETY AT LEAST UNDER

02:41:53.136 --> 02:41:55.205
CURRENT LAW- BUT THEY HAVE AN

02:41:55.272 --> 02:41:56.373
OPPORTUNITY IF THEY TYPICALLY

02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:57.674
FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE USE

02:41:57.741 --> 02:42:00.343
TREATMENT ACTUALLY. PERHAPS GET

02:42:00.410 --> 02:42:03.480
OUT EARLY- AND ALSO GET THE

02:42:03.547 --> 02:42:04.815
RECORD EXPUNGED SO I THINK

02:42:04.881 --> 02:42:06.716
THOSE ARE POSITIVE THINGS. SO

02:42:06.783 --> 02:42:09.419
IT IS A PILOT- I CERTAINLY- IS

02:42:09.486 --> 02:42:10.987
HERE AT THE OPPOSITION THEIR

02:42:11.054 --> 02:42:12.155
CONCERNS WE CERTAINLY DON'T

02:42:12.222 --> 02:42:13.990
MAKE IT A HABIT THAT THAT THAT

02:42:14.057 --> 02:42:16.827
THE STANDARD WE HEAD OF

02:42:16.893 --> 02:42:18.195
SECURITY SO HE'S FOR SUBSTANCE

02:42:18.261 --> 02:42:19.296
USE TREATMENT AS BEING THE

02:42:19.362 --> 02:42:20.263
STANDARD FOR SUBSTANCE USE

02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:21.631
TREATMENT. THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:42:21.698 --> 02:42:23.366
WE'RE LOOKING TO WE'RE LOOKING

02:42:23.433 --> 02:42:25.202
AT A PILOT THAT MAYBE CAN

02:42:25.268 --> 02:42:26.937
CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH

02:42:27.003 --> 02:42:29.272
TO FOR. THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE

02:42:29.339 --> 02:42:31.808
WHO UNFORTUNATELY- UNDER THE

02:42:31.875 --> 02:42:32.909
CURRENT LAW WOULD HAVE STILL

02:42:32.976 --> 02:42:35.645
HAVE TO BE INCARCERATED OR-

02:42:35.712 --> 02:42:38.882
INTO SECURE- SETTING- AND- AND

02:42:38.949 --> 02:42:40.684
SEE WHETHER THIS ACTUALLY HELPS

02:42:40.750 --> 02:42:42.385
PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET. TAKEN CARE

02:42:42.452 --> 02:42:45.856
OF EARLIER AND ALSO- I GIVE

02:42:45.922 --> 02:42:47.124
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTART

02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:48.859
THEIR LIVES. WITH THEIR

02:42:48.925 --> 02:42:50.494
SUBSTANCE USE- UNDER BETTER

02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:54.831
CONTROL.AND SO- REALLY FISH

02:42:54.898 --> 02:42:56.633
YOUR ON THIS- AGAIN IT'S A

02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:59.836
PILOT- DEVELOPMENT WAS ACTUALLY

02:42:59.903 --> 02:43:01.238
TO BE SURE TO ACTUALLY ASK THAT

02:43:01.304 --> 02:43:02.706
TO THE PARTIAL CARE SERVICES

02:43:02.772 --> 02:43:04.441
WHICH NORMALLY OVERSEAS THAT WE

02:43:04.508 --> 02:43:05.675
WANT THE SERVICE OVERSIGHT OVER

02:43:05.742 --> 02:43:08.845
THIS AND- THEY DO OVERSEE-

02:43:08.912 --> 02:43:10.447
SERVICES TREATMENT PROGRAMS

02:43:10.514 --> 02:43:12.115
ABILITY. ON SECURITY ONCE BUT

02:43:12.182 --> 02:43:13.150
AT LEAST TO BE SURE THAT THE

02:43:13.216 --> 02:43:14.784
TREATMENT. OVER THAT THE

02:43:14.851 --> 02:43:15.852
OVERSIGHT OVER THE TREATMENT

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:18.288
IS- AND LONG WITH THE STANDARDS

02:43:18.355 --> 02:43:20.590
OF THE STATE- THAT- THAT THE

02:43:20.657 --> 02:43:21.958
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS FACILITY

02:43:22.025 --> 02:43:23.059
ARE TREATED APPROPRIATELY AND

02:43:23.126 --> 02:43:25.428
FAIRLY- I THOUGHT THIS IS GONNA

02:43:25.495 --> 02:43:26.596
TAKE SOME WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:43:26.663 --> 02:43:28.498
NOT NORMALLY TO SAY. IT THAT

02:43:28.565 --> 02:43:29.432
THE STANDARD IS NOT A SECURE

02:43:29.499 --> 02:43:32.202
FACILITY. BUT APPRECIATE THE

02:43:32.269 --> 02:43:32.802
WORK ON THIS AND WITHOUT WHICH

02:43:32.869 --> 02:43:34.838
I CLOSE. YES THANK YOU I

02:43:34.905 --> 02:43:36.973
APPRECIATE THE- THE DIALOGUE I

02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:38.475
JUST WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE

02:43:38.542 --> 02:43:40.677
ISSUES. TO CENTER ADMIN THERE

02:43:40.744 --> 02:43:41.845
ISN'T HERE AND I DID OVER LOOK

02:43:41.912 --> 02:43:43.213
AT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN HERE

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:45.348
ABOUT AN OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT BY

02:43:45.415 --> 02:43:46.816
AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR BUT

02:43:46.883 --> 02:43:48.485
POTENTIALLY WE CAN CLARIFY THAT

02:43:48.552 --> 02:43:49.386
AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE

02:43:49.452 --> 02:43:50.687
COUNTY REPORT BACK TO. THE

02:43:50.754 --> 02:43:54.090
LEGISLATURE. NOT JUST AN

02:43:54.157 --> 02:43:54.691
EVALUATION AS FAR AS- WHAT THE

02:43:54.758 --> 02:43:56.760
VALUES OF THIS PROJECT ARE AND

02:43:56.826 --> 02:43:58.528
HOW IT COULD BE. POTENTIALLY

02:43:58.595 --> 02:44:00.463
EXTENDED THROUGHOUT. CALIFORNIA

02:44:00.530 --> 02:44:02.432
I GET THE BIG PICTURE IS AS AS

02:44:02.499 --> 02:44:03.934
OTHERS SAID IT'S A BIG LIST OF

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.936
OPPOSITION. AND THIS IS IT THIS

02:44:06.002 --> 02:44:07.571
JOB SOMETIMES PUTS US IN

02:44:07.637 --> 02:44:09.573
UNCOMFORTABLE POSITIONS. THEY

02:44:09.639 --> 02:44:11.041
HAVE TO SAY NO TO SOME PEOPLE

02:44:11.107 --> 02:44:12.609
THAT WE WORK WITH- CERTAINLY

02:44:12.676 --> 02:44:15.312
HAVE AUTHORED BILLS. ON THAT

02:44:15.378 --> 02:44:16.546
WORK WITH MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN

02:44:16.613 --> 02:44:18.014
OPPOSITION. TO REFORM THE

02:44:18.081 --> 02:44:19.883
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IF I

02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:21.418
THOUGHT FOR ONE SECOND THAT

02:44:21.484 --> 02:44:22.652
THIS BILL WOULD INCARCERATE

02:44:22.719 --> 02:44:24.187
MORE INDIVIDUALS PUT MORE

02:44:24.254 --> 02:44:26.756
PEOPLE. BEHIND BARS- FOR DRUG

02:44:26.823 --> 02:44:28.925
RELATED CRIMES I WOULD NEVER

02:44:28.992 --> 02:44:29.559
AUTHORED THIS BILL IN THE FIRST

02:44:29.626 --> 02:44:31.361
PLACE AND I WOULD. DITCH IT

02:44:31.428 --> 02:44:32.996
RIGHT HERE TODAY BUT THIS IS

02:44:33.063 --> 02:44:33.930
NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE

02:44:33.997 --> 02:44:35.365
WE'RE LOOKING AT. THESE ARE

02:44:35.432 --> 02:44:37.300
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OTHERWISE

02:44:37.367 --> 02:44:39.436
AS YOU SAID CHAIRMAN PAN. GOING

02:44:39.502 --> 02:44:41.271

02:44:41.338 --> 02:44:42.973
COUNTY JAIL FOR A LONGER PERIOD

02:44:43.039 --> 02:44:44.674
OF TIME. POTENTIALLY THEIR DRUG

02:44:44.741 --> 02:44:46.409
ADDICTION THERE COULD WORSEN WE

02:44:46.476 --> 02:44:47.477
KNOW THAT DRUGS ARE BROUGHT

02:44:47.544 --> 02:44:49.112
INTO PRISON AND JAIL

02:44:49.179 --> 02:44:50.547
UNFORTUNATELY. SO THEY COULD

02:44:50.614 --> 02:44:55.585
COME OUT YOU. REALLY SO THIS IS

02:44:55.652 --> 02:44:57.554
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:44:57.621 --> 02:44:59.823
TO MAKE A CHOICE. TO GO TO GO

02:44:59.889 --> 02:45:03.126
TO. A DRUG TREATMENT OPTION.

02:45:03.193 --> 02:45:04.527
AND POTENTIALLY REDUCE THEIR

02:45:04.594 --> 02:45:07.964
SENTENCES HAVE EXPUNGEMENT. AND

02:45:08.031 --> 02:45:09.032
SOMETHING THAT REALLY COULD

02:45:09.099 --> 02:45:10.533
WORK IN OUR COMMUNITY CENTER.

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.168
BUT WE'VE ALL SEEN THE

02:45:12.235 --> 02:45:13.737
DISASTERS IN OUR CITIES AND

02:45:13.803 --> 02:45:15.272

MEDICINE AND- WANT TO SUPPORT

02:47:40.884 --> 02:47:42.452
THAT CONCEPT UNFORTUNATELY WE

02:47:42.519 --> 02:47:44.287
WERE NOT ABLE TO LAND ON A SET

02:47:44.354 --> 02:47:45.789
OF AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS WHAT I

02:47:45.855 --> 02:47:46.990
CONSIDER TO BE IMPLEMENTATION

02:47:47.056 --> 02:47:48.358
ISSUES TO MAKEIT SUCCESSFULLY

02:47:48.425 --> 02:47:51.194
IMPLEMENTED- BECAUSE OF THAT I

02:47:51.261 --> 02:47:52.762
PERSONALLY WILL BE STAYING OFF.

02:48:03.573 --> 02:48:04.641
BILL COMES OUT OF THE COMMITTEE

02:48:04.707 --> 02:48:05.942
AND AT THE CENTER WILL CONTINUE

02:48:06.009 --> 02:48:07.977
WORKING ON THOSE IMPLEMENTATION

02:48:08.044 --> 02:48:09.078
ISSUES I THINK THAT WOULD BE

02:48:09.145 --> 02:48:11.748
IMPORTANT THAT IT- IT POINTED.

02:48:11.815 --> 02:48:13.316
IT EVER HAS TO GO WHEN IT HITS

02:48:13.383 --> 02:48:15.385

02:48:16.653 --> 02:48:17.654
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:19.222
SETTLE THAT IN THE WEEKS TIME

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:21.624
SO- WITH THAT JUST THAT'S THE

02:48:21.691 --> 02:48:25.628
