OF WITH ISSUE ONE. AND THAT'S THE VALLEY STATE PRISON BSP ARSENIC AND MANGANESE REMOVAL WATER TREATMENT PLANT- WE ASK PLEASE- THAT YOU PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH BACKGROUND AND THE NEED FOR EACH PROPOSAL BROUGHT FORTH TODAY OF WILL THE CDC ARE BE PRESENTING. YES MANAGER. GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS LEAVE. AND I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CDC ARE AS DISABILITY PLANNING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT FRANK. I DON'T WANT IS FOR THE ARSENIC AND MANGANESE REMOVAL WATER TREATMENT PLANTS A PALLISTER PRISON. AS CDCR CONCURS WITH STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO REJECT WAS WITHOUT PREJUDICE AT THE PROJECT'S DESIGN ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN DELAYED. AND LATE DECEMBER CDCR BECAME AWARE OF SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE COST ESTIMATE FOR THE PROJECT AND THIS IS DELAYED- FINAL APPROVAL OF PULMONARY PLANS AND STATE CRISSCROSSED TRIGGERED ADDITIONAL WORK YOU. ARE WHEN EXAMINING THE SCHEDULE- WORKING DRAWINGS ARE NOW ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED LATE IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. SO DELAYING THE CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION BY A YEAR AT THIS POINT ONLY REPRESENTS A FEW MONTHS DELAYED TWO OR- EXTENDED TIMELINE FOR. THE PROJECT- IN THE MEANTIME P. WILL TO BLAND WATER FROM THE WELLS TO PROVIDE WATER SUPPLY THAT IS SAFE FOR STAFF AND INMATES AT THE S. P. AND THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY. OKAY SO WE NEED HERE TO HEAR FROM FINANCE PLEASE. FOR SPRING RENDON MERIT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE CONCUR WITH CDCR I'M SORRY WE VERY WELL COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN PLEASE. GOOD MORNING- BRANDON MERIT DEPARTMENT FINANCE WE CONCUR WITH CDCR. OKAY AND THE L. A- PLEASE. MORNING I KNOW NEIL. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GO AHEAD. WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL- AND NOR DO WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED AT REJECTION OF TALK TO JESS. OKAY. EARN I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS HERE- CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN OF THE ISSUE WITH ARSENIC AND MANGANESE AGAIN IN THE WELLS AND THE REASON BEHIND THE EXTENDED TIMELINE CAN YOU. SUMMARIZE IT AGAIN. SURE OKAY- THE PROJECT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE TREND OF INCREASING ARSENIC AND MANGANESE LEVELS IN THE GROUNDWATER OF THOSE LEVELS VERY AND- DIFFERENT WELLS AND CURRENTLY- SAFE DRINKING WATER IS ABLE TO BE PROVIDED BY PLANTING- THE SOURCE WATER FROM THE DIFFERENT WELLS- AS I SAY- I MENTIONED EARLIER- THE- COST ESTIMATE FOR THE PROJECT THAT- THE CONCLUSION OF LUNAR PLANS WAS. QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED- THEREFORE THAT TRIGGERED AN ADDITIONAL REVIEW EXTENDING THE TIMELINE FOR. LANDS AND SUBSEQUENTLY AT THE START OF WORKING DRAWINGS- THAT THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE EXTENT I'M ONE. OKAY I WAS CONCERNED THAT EXTENDING THE TIMELINE FURTHER WOULD ENDANGER THE INCARCERATED MEN AND WOMEN AT THE S. P. AND C. C. W. F. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY HAVE SAFE WATER WHILE THIS TIME LINE IS EXTENDED- AS I ALSO MENTIONED- THE- EXTENDED TIMELINE REALLY ONLY REPRESENTS A COUPLE OF MONTHS- BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THE- ANTICIPATED A CONCLUSION OF WORKING DRAWINGS WHICH IS NOW EXPECTED TO BE LATE IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- SO- IN THE IN THE MEANTIME- THE WATER WILL BE CONTINUE TO PLAN TO PROVIDE A SAFE WATER SUPPLIES TO THE INSTITUTION. OKAY THANK YOU- COLLEAGUES. YES SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MEDICARE SO THERE'S AN A LA A REPORT- THAT INDICATES THERE BELIEVE THAT UP TO FIVE PRISONS COULD BE CLOSED- IS VSP ONE OF THOSE PRISON IS LIKELY TO BE ON THAT LIST. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WOULD YOU LIKE US TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION CENTER NEWMAN. I GUESS YOU COULD START FIRST NAME LIKE HERE FROM CITIES YOUR SHORT I GUESS. THE CONCERN IS IF THE IF- THIS WINDS UP. IF IT IS TRUE THAT WE CAN CLOSE FIVE PRISONS AND THIS WERE ONE OF THOSE PERSPECTIVE FIVE- THE THAT WOULD PREEMPT THE NEED FOR THIS PROJECT OBVIOUSLY- SO WE- AS AS YOU INDICATED WE HAVE AN SSN BASED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S POPULATION PROJECTIONS. AT THE STATE COULD CLOSE FIVE PRISONS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS ONE OF THAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY PLANNED TO CLOSE THE DOOR VOCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE PRISONS THAT LEAVES FOR LEFT IT APARTMENT HASN'T- INDICATED WHAT PRISON IT WILL CLOSE- IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. WHICH IT PLANS IT HAS INDICATED IT WILL CLOSE ONE PRISON BEYOND THAT THAT DEPARTMENT HASN'T INDICATED ANY OTHER- OR COMMITTED TO ANY FURTHER PRISON CLOSURES- HOWEVER BASED ON OUR INITIAL- ASSESSMENT. WE THINK THAT THE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN NORCO. THAT CALIFORNIA MEN'S COLONY IN SAN LUIS OBISPO SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON AND CORRECTIONAL TRAINING FACILITY IN SOLEDAD ALL APPEAR TO BE. REASONABLE CANDIDATES FORECLOSURE GIVEN THEIR HIGH INFRASTRUCTURE COST- AND RELATIVELY HIGH OPERATIONAL COSTS IN COMPARISON TO THEIR IN THE CAPACITY. CREATURE THAT'S ARE THERE AND THEN BY INFERENCE THEN THE OBVIOUS P. THAT IS DUE FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE WOULD NOT BE ON THAT LIST AND THEIR FOURTH THIS IS A REASONABLE EXPENSE LOOKING FORWARD. RIGHT AS WE DON'T IN OUR REVIEW WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED VALLEY STATE PRISON AS A LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR CLOSURE- ALTHOUGH AS YOU'LL HEAR ME DISCUSS LATER IN ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION COME FORWARD WITH A LIST OF LIKELY. AG PRISONS FOR CLOSURE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS IMPLEMENTING OUR RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO D. AS- PROPOSED AGGREGATION FOR SPECIAL REPAIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO TO THE EXTENT THE INITIATION DID. INCLUDE THAT PRISON AS A- A LIKELY CANDIDATE THAT IT BELIEVES- WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR CLOSURE THEN OF COURSE WE WOULD HAVE. CONCERNS WITH THIS CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD FISH AT THAT SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT A PRISON WHERE THE WATER IS. A SUSPECT QUALITY MIGHT BE. CONSIDERED AT SOME POINT FOR THAT LIST. THANK YOU. SECRETARY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST GOING BACK TO- PICTURES QUESTION ABOUT. SO THE QUALITY OF THE WATER OR WRIST THE INMATES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS MMHM WELL THE PROJECTS BEING- RECALCULATED REBUILD- WHAT CAN YOU JUST. TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE WITH US IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING WHY THIS IS NOT A RISK I HEARD OF THE TERM- YOU KNOW THE- THAT'LL BE A BLENDED APPROACH IN THE MEANTIME- IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE TALKING I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN ANYONE'S MOUTH OR MY OWN MIND IS THAT. THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE- DILUTING THE- THE ARSENIC AND MANGANESE LEVELS BY BY IMPORTING. A WATER- TOOK TO BLEND WITH THE WELL WATER IN. AND DEPENDING ON THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION I GUESS THE FAULT QUESTIONS WOULD BE. YOU KNOW WHY NOT JUST IMPORT WATER INTO INTO INTO THE TANKS OF THE WORLD'S WOULD NORMALLY FEED ON INTERFACES OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME COST TO THAT BUT- TO ELIMINATE THE INMATE RISK. YEAH SURE THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO THERE IS NO EXTERNAL WATER SOURCE- OR- FEES FOR THE WATER SUPPLY SO WHAT THE SITUATION WE HAVE IS THERE ARE SEVERAL WELLS SOME OF WHICH HAVE- THAT ARSENIC LEVELS THAT EXCEED. DRINKING WATER STANDARDS BUT OTHERS THAT DO NOT SEEN BY BLENDING THEM TOGETHER OR WE CAN STAY UNDER- THE- THE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS FOR ARSENIC AND MANGANESE- I JUST NEED IT BECAUSE WE SEE- A TRANS- IN ALL THE WELLS INCREASING LEVELS. ARE BUT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY PROBLEM WITH LANDING OVER THE FORECASTED- PROJECT TIMELINE- DESERT CIRCLING BACK- TO ELYAS- COMMENTS- I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COMMITTED SAID THE CLOSURE OF TWO PRESENTS AND NOTHING BEYOND THAT AT THIS TIME- AND I HAVE. AND ALSO I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS WATER TREATMENT PLANTS A SERVICE BOTH ABOUT THE STATE PRISON AND THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY- SO- THE PRICE WOULD BE NEEDED UNLESS BOTH PERSONS. AND THAT'S VERY UNLIKELY SINCE THIS CAL WOMEN'S IS- ONE OF A FEW WOMEN'S PRISON FIFTH. THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE YOU- FOLLOWING UP ON THE EARLIER QUESTIONS AS WELL. IT IS ONE ONE LAST QUESTION WHAT WHAT'S THE TOTAL GALLONS USED PER DAY- TO SUPPLY THE FACILITY. DON'T HAVE- LET ME LET ME LET ME TAKE A SHORT CUT WAY OF DEALING DEALING WITH WHAT I'M GETTING AT I KNOW YOU SAID THAT THERE'S NO ALTERNATE SOURCE WATER WITH I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE WATER WHICH IS TAKING% BRINGING IT IN- THERE'S RASHES AND FACILITIES ALL OVER OF MY DISTRICT IN IN THE HILLS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT DEPEND UPON A PERCENT ON IMPORTED WATER LIKE THAT- AND I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET AN IDEA AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S- COMPLETELY INFEASIBLE IMPRACTICABLE I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL USAGE. A PER DAY- UP. NORTH THAT WAS EVEN COMPARED YOU KNOW TO THE SPLENDID APPROACH AS AS AN ALTERNATIVE. AND ALLOW ME SAY I AM NOT I THINK THE BLENDED APPROACH IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA I'M JUST I'M JUST CURIOUS ENOUGH AT THIS POINT TO. ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD BE JUST. SAID HEY FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS WE'LL JUST. WE'LL JUST IMPORT THE WATER. I DON'T HAVE THIS SPECIFIC- VOLUME INFORMATION AT THE- TOOK MY- FINGERS RIGHT NOW- HOWEVER AS CERTAINLY IMPORTING WATER FOR USE WOULD BE A- MORE EXPENSIVE. A TEMPORARY. SOLUTION WE WILL OF COURSE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT THE LEVELS OF THESE CONSTITUENTS AND THE WATER. AND IF NECESSARY WE WOULD MOVE TO SOME ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR- SILVA. YES IT WILL BE JUST SAY OF THEM. RIGHT UNDER THAT THE MOST. OUR WATER HAS SOME OF ARSENIC IN IT I DON'T KNOW BUT MAINLY SO- YOU KNOW IT'S ON THAT BASIS- SUPPORTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS- COLLEAGUES- THE IDEA THAT- IT'S RARE TO SEE. BUT YOU KNOW ZERO CONTENT- YOU KNOW IT AIN'T IN ANY SYSTEM SO IF YOU CAN BRING IT DOWN BY BLAMING THEM A PERSON BECAUSE THAT PROBABLY IS THE BEST APPROACH BUT AS I SAID I WAS JUST CURIOUS AS TO. AS TO THAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE. THANK YOU. OKAY WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE- PATIENT YEAH. YOUR THROUGH THE CHERRY IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE AT THIS POINT TO SATISFY MY CURIOSITY IF NOTHING ELSE IF IT'S NOT TOO HARD TO DIG UP THANK YOU- NO MORE QUESTIONS THE- RECOMMENDATION ON THIS IS TO REJECT WITHOUT. PREJUDICE AND WE CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. WHICH I THINK WILL CONTINUE TO RAISE WHAT A CENTER NEWMAN'S A CONCERNS ARE AT SO WE COULD GET DEEPER ON THAT ON THAT- ON THIS ISSUE- SO COULD WE HAVE CDC ARE PRESENT PLEASE. I THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I I'LL NOTE THAT- THERE ARE FOUR SEPARATE- PROPOSALS IN THIS ITEM- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PRESENTS ALL FOUR AND THEN TAKE QUESTIONS OR DO YOU WANT ME TO PAUSE BETWEEN EACH ONE. OF YOU WANT TO JUST TAKE ALL FOUR WE COULD GET THE COMPLETE PICTURE. OKAY THANK THANK YOU- THE FIRST. THE FIRST ITEM IS A REAPPROPRIATION OF FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION- GENERAL FUND- THAT WAS ORIGINALLY APPROPRIATED AND THAT TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT FOR THE FIRE ALARM FIRE SUPPRESSION REPAIR. PROJECTS AT MULE CREEK STATE PRISON RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO. WITH PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO EXTEND THE EXPENDITURE AND CONGRESS. APPROVED JAN THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY OR- AT THE TIMELINE FOR ESTABLISHING PERFORMANCE CRITERIA WHICH SETS FORTH THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A FIRM. TO COMPLETE AT DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE THUMB. I WAS EXTENDED TENTH FULLY DOCUMENTED PROJECT SCOPE. AND TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME FOR REVIEW SUBMITTALS TO THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. AT THE NOTICE A BIT TO PROCEED TO THE SELECTED DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTOR IS ANTICIPATED AND ALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WITH THE PROJECT DURATION OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. ARE THERE FOR PROJECT COMPLETION IS ANTICIPATED AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY THREE- THIS ACTION IS NECESSARY TO- HAVE THE- FUNDS AVAILABLE TO PROCEED THROUGH THE- DESIGN. BUILD PHASE OF THE PROJECT. AT THE NEXT IS FOR HEALTH OF HIS REPIR AT THE HELP READ. CENTER IT'S FOR SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO MAKE HEALTH CARE FACILITY REPAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER THIS IS A RECENT MIDDLE OF THE REQUEST WAS WITHDRAWN AT LAST YEAR'S MAY REVISION. I TRICKS WILL MAKE NUMEROUS REPAIRS THAT'S YOUR SEATS TO MAKE MEDICAL SPACES SAFE AND FUNCTIONAL INCLUDING REPLACING DAMAGED FLOORING WALLS CASE WORK IN DOORS. IN ADDITION THE PROJECT WILL REPLACE SEVERAL EXISTING MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION WHEN DOES IT PROTECT ALL MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION MENDOZA LONGCASE WORKPLACE FANS AND INSTALLATION OF HANDWASHING THINGS. THIS FACILITY WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM- BECAUSE THAT TWENTY TWELVE BLUEPRINTS ANTICIPATED IT WOULD CLOSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE HOWEVER AT THIS TIME FINISAR INTENDS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS IT'S HERE'S THE- NEEDS REPAIRS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE MEDICAL SPACE TO SERVE THE POPULATION I WAS THERE. I REPAIRS ARE ANTICIPATED TO BEGIN IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AFTER DESIGN IS COMPLETED AND REPAIRS ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED OVER A NINETEEN MONTH PERIOD. AFTER DESIGN IS COMPLETE- WITH A PROJECT COMPLETION AND- THE FALL POINTS TWENTY TWENTY. FIVE THE THIRD REQUEST IN THIS ITEM FOR ONE TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS DID YOU SEE OUR IS DEPARTMENT AND- AT THE REQUEST REQUESTED ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION ALLOWS CITIES HERE TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE. PLANS SPECIAL RIPARIAN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS TO ADDRESS YOU SEE R. AS- A SPECIAL KERN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. AND TO ACHIEVE MADE MAJOR BUILDING AND SITE WIDE IFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR SYSTEM REPLACEMENT. PROJECTS ARE PRIORITIZED AT ADDRESS SEVERAL TYPES OF CONDITIONS WHICH IS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THE CORRECT BAYERN'S LIFE SAFETY ISSUES. TO REPAIR REPLACE SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEED IS THE ONLY OPERATIONAL FOR TO ADDRESS SITE WIDE SECURITY ISSUES. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT IS IN ADDITION TO EXISTING PROJECTS UNDERNEATH THAT NORMALLY OCCUR EACH FISCAL YEAR AND OUR TRUST EUROCITY SERVICE BASED NETWORK ALLOCATION TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE FOURTH PROPOSAL- AND- THIS ITEM IS FOR REPLACEMENT- IT'S FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE ROOF A CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO WHICH CONSIST I'M SORRY- WITH THE REPLACEMENT IS FOR MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE- BRUCE IT'S HOW CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON LOS ANGELES- AND CONSISTS OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS JOURNAL FINDS FOR DESIGN AND TWENTY TWO AND THIRTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS UP OR CONSTRUCTION. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. REPLACEMENT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE DETERIORATING CONDITIONS OF EXISTING ROOMS THAT SEVERELY IMPACT HOUSING CONDITIONS AN INMATE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. I WITH THIS YEAR'S PROPOSALS- CDCR HAS REEVALUATED THE PHASE PLANNED FOR STATE WHAT ROOF REPLACEMENTS ARE RESULTING IN A RECORDED STATION UP THE REMAINING FACILITY. SPECIFICALLY OF THE SAUDIS WITH HIGH RISK MEDICAL AND AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT MISSIONS WERE GIVEN HIGHER PRIORITY AS THOSE INMATES. ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HARM TO THE LEAKY ROOFS IN HOUSING PROGRAM LOCATION. OKAY. C. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS JUSTIN EDELMAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND- L. A. AS RECOMMENDATIONS ON SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY REPAIRS IT'S HERE SEE THE L. A. RECOMMENDED- REJECTION OF THE PROPOSAL UNLESS THE ADMINISTRATION CAN PROVIDE A LONG TERM PLAN FOR THE FACILITY THIS IS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE REPAIRS WILL BE COMPLETED SUFFICIENTLY IN ADVANCE OF ANY. POTENTIAL OUR FUTURE CLOSER DATE. AND THERE ARE WE WANT WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR EXISTING- OR PRESSURES IT EGGS NEED TO BE CAN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION- SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY TWELVE AT CCR IMPLEMENTED THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE TREATMENT AND CLINICAL SPACE ACROSS ALL OF ITS INSTITUTIONS FOR HEALTH CARE NEEDS- HOWEVER BACK MAN IN TWENTY TWELVE THERE WAS ANTICIPATED CLOSURE OF CRC SO THEY HECTIC PROJECT AS IT'S KNOWN IS THAT WAS NEVER IMPLEMENTED IT'S YOUR SEATS. AND SO THEY ARE C. HAS BEEN OPERATING- WITHOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF A HECTIC PROJECT AND THAT'S RESULTED IN A MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE FACILITY IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN OTHER PRISONS. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE REQUESTING BE AT SIX TWENTY MILLION HERE CHECK KIND OF REPAIR AND REFINED SOME OF THESE- IT'S SEVENTIES WHICH APPROACHING SEVENTY FIVE YEARS IN AGE. THAT THAT THEY'RE UP TO THAT MEDICAL STANDARDS FOR THE FEDERAL RECEIVERSHIP- BETTER INDICATING OTHER INSTITUTIONS- BAY AREA ALSO RECOMMENDED. THAT REJECTING OR PROHIBITING CCR FROM SPENDING- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS AT PRISONS THAT ARE LIKELY OR STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE. AND WE ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT. IDENTIFYING PRISONS FOR CLOSURE IS A VERY COMPLICATED AND SENSITIVE ISSUE ON THEIR MANY FACTORS BEYOND JUST INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT GO INTO. WHICH PRESENTS THE CLOTHES AND HOW TO IDENTIFY THOSE PRISONS- IT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE THAT POPULATION MISSIONS- STAFFING LEVELS WE HAVE BILL BELICHICK OF PROGRAM OPPORTUNITIES AT THESE INSTITUTIONS. HAS COVERED HAS DEMONSTRATED WE ALSO NEED TO BEAR IN MIND THE INSTITUTIONS NEED A CERTAIN LEVEL SPACE TO PREVENT- AIRBORNE PATHOGENS FROM BEING EASILY SPREAD- WHICH IS AGAIN VERY IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND FOR COURT CONSIDERATIONS. GOING FORWARD. AND SO. REALLY I PRISONS ARE LIKE TO CLOSE ALSO OPERATIONAL. FOR CD START THREE ISSUES WITH STAFFING- IN MAINTAINING INSTITUTIONS FOR THE NEED UNTIL THEY WILL CLOSE. SO IT'S A REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND IDENTIFYING PRISONS FOR CLOSURE IS A PATH WE DON'T WANT TO START DOWN INTO WERE RELATIVELY CERTAIN THAT CAN BE COMPLETED- AND AGAIN BRINGING BACK TO THE POINT OF. HAVING A BIT BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY IN TWENTY TWELVE IT WAS. CONSIDERED FOR POSSIBLE CLOSURE SO WE SET OURSELVES UP FOR FUTURE COSTS- THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT IN THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. OKAY AND BEFORE WE MOVE ON ON THAT ISSUE- BELIAU. COMMENTS PLEASE THIS IS CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THE L. A. L. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- COMMITTEE STAFF HAS ASKED ME TO PROVIDE A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON AT SHARES INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND THEN I WILL GET MY RECORD OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT. I THEIR PROPOSALS IN THIS ITEM. I TO MOVING INTO THAT BACKGROUND I'VE BEEN A TALK ABOUT TWO MAIN TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND THEN PROVIDE SEND A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. I SPECIAL REPAIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REFERS TO A CATEGORY OF PROJECTS THAT ARE- SENSUALLY REQUIRED TO BRING IN EXISTING. ASSETS SUCH AS A BUILDING ORA BOILER ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FROM A SUB PAR OR FAILED STATE PATH TO ANY NEEDED SERVICE LEVEL THAT THEY'RE BIGGER THAN YOUR NORMAL AND PROGRESS STANDARD ROUTINE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE ARE SIMPLE FOR REPLACEMENT OF A PARK. HE SIERRA AND BACKLOG- OF ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN SPECIAL REPAIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THROUGHOUT ITS PRISONS- VOTER CAN'T FIX PACKS OF THE ACTUAL NEED IS CLOSER TO THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. ADD THE DEPARTMENT NOTE THE BASE THE PURPOSE LEASE OKAY TO BASE BUDGET INCLUDES SIX MILLION FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT IN RECENT YEARS IT'S RECEIVE VARIOUS ONE TIME AUGMENTATION SUCH AS- FOR ROOF REPLACEMENTS- CAPITAL OUTLAY AND THE OTHER. TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT I WANTED TO GIVE A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON- IS ACCUSED YOU CAN THINK OF IS CREATING A NEW ASSET AS OPPOSED TO REPAIRED REPAIRING OR REPLACING SOMETHING THAT'S EXISTING. AND THERE ISN'T A SIMILAR BACKLOG TRACKING SYSTEM FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY AS THERE IS FOR DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE SPECIAL REPAIRS- HOWEVER THAT IT ADMINISTRATION FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN- INDICATES THAT. IT PLANS TO REQUEST FUNDING OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FOR. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AT ITS FACILITIES- ALTHOUGH A RECENT STUDY AND IN DEPTH STUDY BY AN EXTERNAL CONTRACTOR OF THE STATE'S TWELVE OLDEST PRISONS- SUGGESTS THAT THE NEED IS ACTUALLY MUCH LARGER. AND I CAN STILL RECOMMENDED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BACK CAPITAL OUTLAY AND SPECIAL REPAIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS MOSTLY CAPITAL OUTLAY. AT YES THOSE TWELVE PRISON LOANS TOTALING. SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEED THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED SUPPLEMENTAL RECORDING LANGUAGE WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT. BY JANUARY TENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO A- A LIST OF PROJECTS ARE IDENTIFYING A LIST OF PROJECTS ARE LIKELY TO BE NEEDED OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO KEEP ITS PRISONS OPERATIONAL AND EITHER INDEFINITELY OR UNTIL THEY'RE CLOSED- AND TO THE LANGUAGE ALSO DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT TO PRIORITIZE THAT LIST BASED ON CERTAIN CRITERIA. HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDICATED THAT IT DOESN'T PLAN TO FULLY COMPLY WITH THIS LANGUAGE I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED BECAUSE A LACK OF A LONG TERM PLAN MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE. AND THE GOVERNOR TO FOR STRUCTURE PROPOSALS MOREOVER IF THE STATE CONTINUES TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WITHOUT A LONG VIEW IT RISKS ONE UNNECESSARILY SPENDING MONEY ON SUCH AS ON PROJECTS- THAT OUR LIVES LATER AFTER SILLY IS THAT ARE LATER EITHER CLOSED OR REBUILD MORE THOROUGHLY. TO GET REST MISSING OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL BENEFITS OR REDUCED OPERATIONAL COSTS SUCH AS BY RELOCATING FACILITIES OR BEEN DESIGNING THEM. AND THREE AT RISK FAILING TO SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS- MITIGATE THE RISK OF INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE WHICH CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT COST AND SAFETY IMPLICATIONS. AND UNLESS YOU'RE LIKE ME TO PIES FOR ANY QUESTIONS BUT I WILL MOVE ON TO GET OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. WHAT DID YOU FINISH WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN WE COULD START WITH OUR QUESTIONS- SO- WE RECOMMENDATIONS ON TWO OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS IN THIS ITEM. FIRST IS A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR REQUESTED DOCUMENTATION TO THE DEPARTMENT SPACE SPECIAL REPAIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND BUDGET GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM WE RECOMMEND APPROVING IT BUT WE RECOMMEND RESTRICTING THE USAGE OF THE FUNDS- SO THAT THEY CANNOT BE SPENT ON PRISONS LIKELY TO BE CLOSED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THIS STATE IS PLAIN CLOTHES IN NINETEEN PRISON IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND COULD WE THINK CLOTHES- AROUND THREE ADDITIONAL PRISONS- AND THESE DEFERRED SPECIAL CARE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS CAN TAKE A COUPLE YEARS TO COMPLETE SO IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE STATE WOULD BE COMPLETING THE REPAIR. AROUND THE TIME THAT THE PRISON IS CLOSE WHICH WOULD NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE. SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND APPROVING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE RESTRICTING CDC ARE FROM SPENDING THE FUNDS AB PRISONS LIKELY FOR TO BE CLOSED TO FACILITATE THAT WE THINK THAT THAT MINISTRATION SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF PRISONS TO BE CLOSED- ABSENT THAT BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE IDENTIFIED- FOR PRISONS. THAT WE THINK ARE STRONG CANDIDATES. AND THEN THE SECOND. THAT WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON IS THE- HEALTHCARE FACILITY REPAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA REAL. ELEVATION CENTER. A SIMILAR ANALYSIS APPLIES HERE AND IT THE PROPOSAL THAT EXCUSE ME TO PRISON SEEMS TO BE A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR CLOSURE IN FACT ADMINISTRATION ITSELF IS PROPOSED FOR CLOSURE. IN THE PAST- IF THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT WHERE THAT. VERY POSSIBLY BE COMPLETED AROUND THE TIME THAT THE PRISON IS BEING CLOSED AND AGAIN I WOULD NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE SO UNLESS THAT ADMINISTRATION CAN PROVIDE A LONG TERM PLAN FOR THIS PRISON THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE FACILITY OR EXCUSE ME THAT THE PROJECT WOULD BE COMPLETED IN ADVANCE OF A POTENTIAL CLOSURE DATE- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING. THIS PROPOSAL AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES GIVE THAT IT COULD REALLOCATE THE FUNDS TO. ADDRESS HIGH PRIORITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AT OTHER PRISONS THAT ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE CLOSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK THIS GOES TO WHAT SENATOR NEWMAN RAISED A LITTLE WHILE AGO WHICH IS WHY IS IT THAT WE CANNOT GET. THIS ARM PRIORITIZATION ALL LONG TERM PRIVATIZATION- PLAN- THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OF PAST RESTORATIONS INCLUDED SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH LONG TERM PRIORITIZATION OVER PROJECTS EXLEY EXCEEDING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU ALL TO PLEASE GIVE THE SUBCOMMITTEE AN UPDATE ON THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TOWARDS SATISFYING THE SRO REPORT THAT THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. I'VE HEARD THAT THE CDC ARE SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT COMPLY WITH PARTS OR ALL OF THE S. R. L. R. L. FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND IT'S QUITE DISTURBING- TO HEAR THAT RATHER THAN HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS IS AS FAR AS WE'VE GOTTEN. SOMETHING TO SHOW IS THAT YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT DOING IT OR IF YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT DOING THAT THEN WE SHOULD KNOW AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE SHOULD DO BUT- I THINK IT'S ANA IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS AS THE CONTEXT FOR THE OUR REQUESTS THAT ARE BEING MADE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE ANSWERS TO THE LONG TERM OTHERWISE WERE REALLY WASTING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY- SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HEAR FROM. OF THE CDC ARE WHY YOU WON'T COMPLY WITH UP I BELIEVE WHAT IS YOUR DUTY. TO GIVE US THIS OUR PLAN. I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION FROM CBC ARE IS COMMITTED TO SHARING AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ITS FACILITIES CONDITION AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. OTHER SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT NEEDS ARE SIGNIFICANT- WITH MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED STATE WIDE. CDC I RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE DECISIONS REGARDING INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. AS WITH ALL FACILITIES IN CAPITAL PROGRAM CITY HERE IS INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED AS A POINT IN TIME. AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE ABOUT THE SILICON% VISION OR POLICY DIRECTION TENCEL PROJECTS WILL USE. ANYTHING IS LANDS. THE TEN YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE DOCUMENT AS PROPOSED AND B. S. R. L. EXPANDS BEYOND HOW THE STATE CURRENTLY PLANS FOR ITS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THE CURRENT PROCESS THE FIVE YEAR PLANNING FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY NEEDS. FOLLOWED BY CDCR AND OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS WITH CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAMS IN STRAIGHT SETS CDCR HAS MANY HIGH PRIORITY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS BEYOND THOSE FOR WHICH FUNDING IS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. EVEN IN THE BEST A BUDGET CIRCUMSTANCES. AS NOTED MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS HAVEBEEN IDENTIFIED STATEWIDE. WHICH FAR EXCEEDS AVAILABLE FUNDING. FROM THAT LIST OR BASED ON OTHER EMERGENCY NEEDS CDC ARE ONLY PROCEEDS WITH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS WITHIN AVAILABLE RESOURCES. INFORMATION ABOUT THE SAUDIS IS NOT PERFECT AND CHANGES OVER TIME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY EVERY PROJECT THAT WILL BE NEEDED OVER TEN YEAR WINDOW. INTENDING TO DO SO WOULD DIVERT RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS CURRENT. DRIVERS FOR PRIORITIZING PROJECTS COMPLEX MULTIFACTORIAL. PROJECTS ADDRESS A WIDE GAMUT OF NEEDS WHETHER IT IS ADDRESSING ASSET RENEWAL PROVIDING ADEQUATE SPACE FOR PROGRAMMING. MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE DRESSING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CORRECTING OPERATIONAL ISSUES REPORTING COSTS THROUGH MODIFICATIONS OR ADDITIONS TO INFRASTRUCTURE. EXCEPTION ARE YOU TESTING THESE NEEDS IS COMPLEX AND BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT ANY GIVEN POINT. MASTER PLAN ANNUAL REPORT WHICH IS RELEASED EACH JANUARY FOR THE PRIOR CALENDAR YEAR INCLUDES MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT CITIES HERE IS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. TO PROVIDE MORE COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THE LEGISLATURE'S DESIRE FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT CITY SCARS WITH SAUDIS AND THEIR NEEDS. CDCR INTENDS TO PROVIDE IN FUTURE FASTER PLAN ANNUAL REPORTS YOUR AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS INCLUDING CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS INCLUDING FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN AND CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SPECIAL REPAIR PROJECT. THAT SAID WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAFF TO MODIFY AND REFINE THE REPORTING LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCARS DISABILITIES. THEIR CONDITIONS AND POTENTIAL FUTURE PRICE. SO THE ANSWER IS. TO OUR THE REQUESTED THAT WE HAVE A LONG TERM PRIORITIZATION ON THESE PROJECTS YOUR ANSWER IS NO OR YES. AS I SAID THE PRIORITIES ARE ARE POINT IN TIME THE NEEDS ARE ARE POINT IN TIME AND WE DON'T HAVE PERFECT INFORMATION OVER A TEN YEAR- TEN YEAR PLANNING HORIZON- SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING AVAILABLE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE A BETTER FACILITY. WELL I THINK THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT ANY DEPARTMENT OR- YOU KNOW ANY DEPARTMENT GOES THROUGH IS WE DON'T HAVE PERFECT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT. FEW MONTHS A FEW YEARS BUT WE HAVE TO DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN- AND THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS THIS KIND OF INFORMATION. OF SO AT. MAYBE THE L. A. O. COULD COMMENT ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID RIGHT NOW MISS CAITLYN AMOENUS- O'NEILL- SO TOTALLY- YOUR POINT CENTER DORADO ABOUT. HOW JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PERFECT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW TO. I MEAN WE CAN'T PLAN FOR THE FUTURE WE THAT CERTAINLY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE- IN FACT. THERE'S UNCERTAINTY AND POINT IN TIME INFORMATION IS YOURS ALL THE TIME IN STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESSES SO- WE CERTAINLY DON'T SEE THAT AS A BARRIER TO. DOINGS TO ENGAGING IN STRATEGIC PLANNING AROUND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS- ON THE DEPARTMENT'S ARGUMENT THAT- IDENTIFYING PRISONS WAY TO PRESENT STAFFING CHALLENGES AND OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES WE ALSO I DON'T SEE THIS AS PROHIBITIVE TO- PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT- LONG TERM PLANS FOR THE FACILITY SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. AND WE THINK THAT IT COULD IN FACT- I MEAN GIVEN THE POPULATION DECLINE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A PRISON IS SCHEDULED TO BE CLOSED AT LEAST ONE. STAFF OUT THERE ARE ALREADY PROBABLY WONDERING IF IT'S GOING TO BE THERE PRESENT- WHICH CAN BE CREATING CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ANXIETY SO TO THE EXTENT WE COULD THEY COULD IN FACT BE A BENEFIT TO STAFF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY- THEIR LIVES. KNOWING THAT THEY MIGHT BE MOVING PRESENCE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE SO THAT'S JUST A DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE. TO TAKE ON THAT THAT ARGUMENT- I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS- BUT YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING- OR MAYBE I JUST THOUGHT YOU SAID- OF A PRIORITY BY INSTITUTION- OR OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIST BY IN INSTITUTION OR DID I HEAR YOU WRONG BUT IF YOU HAVE A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIST BY INSTITUTION. WHAT IS THAT AND- YOU KNOW GIVE US MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. CERTAINLY THANKS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THAT'S SO AS- HAS BEEN MENTIONING A FEW TIMES WE DO HAVE THE LIST OF THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF- AT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AND- THAT THAT LIST IS- YOU KNOW HAS SPECIFIC- PROJECTS- BY MY INSTITUTION. AND I BELIEVE- YOU KNOW- FINANCES PROVIDED THAT'S L. A. O. AND IF NOT WE CAN CERTAINLY- HAVE THAT LIST LIST PROVIDED. OKAY THAT'S A MAINTENANCE LIST THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIST HERNANDEZ YOU SAID YOU HAVE ONE. YES BIRTH FOR THE BILLION DOLLARS. ARE THERE OTHERS YOU SAID FOR THE BALL DOLLARS AT I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE REFERRING TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS I'VE HEARD THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS- DIFFERENT NUMBERS SO WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO. CORRECT SO THE BILLION DOLLARS LAST- IS REPRESENTS A LIST OF. YOU KNOW PROJECTS OR THAT NEED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT HAVE A SCOPE RELATED TO THEM- AT THE THIRTEEN BILLION BILLION DOLLARS IS AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT- POTENTIALLY THE FACILITIES COULD NEED- BUT THERE AREN'T SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BEHIND THE THIRTEEN BUT BILLION DOLLAR LESS. I'LL OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES. SIR NEWMAN FOR SECRETARY ZINKE. THANK YOU THINK MANAGER- IS REALLY A QUESTION I THINK. FOR THE L. A. O. IT IS PRETTY CLEAR WHEN WE SAY THAT THERE ARE TWO PRISON SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE- I THINK IT'S- JUST BASIC UNREFUTED FACTS ON THE TABLE THOSE. THOSE ARE SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE AND I THINK IF WE PRESSED WE COULD. WE GET CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING- TIMELINE AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU USE THE TERM LIKELY SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF THAT I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS YOUR WORKING DEFINITION I DON'T KNOW- I MEAN I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IS IN LAYPERSON'S TERMS THAT FOR SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE IS MANDATORY NATION THAT- MORE PRISONS ARE IN THAT CATEGORY I'M JUST WONDERING. WHAT'S BEHIND THAT WHAT WHAT INSPIRES THAT PHRASEOLOGY LIKELY SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE. THIS IS CAN'T FIND ANY ALL. HE WE DIDN'T WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT ANY PRISONS BEYOND DUPLICATION OR INSTITUTION AT THIS POINT HAVE SPECIFICALLY BEEN SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE- WE'RE- BEGIN TO. AND PRISONS THAT ARE LIKELY CANDIDATES FORECLOSURE AND BY THAT WE MEAN- PRISONS WHERE THE STATE COULD CLOSE DOWN WITHOUT CREATING MAJOR OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS THAT WOULD BE COSTLY OR- VERY DIFFICULT TO. DEAL WITH IN OTHER WORDS- FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE CLOSE THE PRISON THAT- RELIED ON A NEIGHBORING PRESENT IF PROVIDE KEY SERVICES FOR IT OUR SITE IS A PRIVILEGE THE STATE CLOSE THE PRISON THAT WHAT'S PROVIDING KEY SERVICES TO A NEIGHBORING PRESIDENT THAT WOULD BE- A CHALLENGE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH IT WOULD HAVE TO SHIFT. THAT SERVICE TWO OF THE OTHER PRESENT WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY INSURMOUNTABLE BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT- OTHER PRISONS HAVE KEY MEDICAL MISSIONS FOR EXAMPLE SO THE STATE COULDN'T CLOSE AND WITHOUT- SHIFTING OUR DATA MEDICAL CAPACITY SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE SYSTEM. ANOTHER CRITERIA WE. LOOKED AT IS- THERE THERE BECAUSE- TIONAL. AND IN NEEDS RELATIVE TO THEIR- INNATE CAPACITY SO THAT'S SORT OF A- ROUGH MEASURES YOU CAN THINK OF IS SORT OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OR- OF OFTEN CONTINUING TO OPERATE THAT PRISON- AND THEN A THIRD CRITERIA ONE MIGHT CONSIDER IS THE LOCATION OF THE PRISONS IN SOME CASES. IT CAN BE HARD FOR CDCR TO RECRUIT RECRUIT AND RETAIN STAFF- PARTICULARLY MEDICAL STAFF IN SOME CASES PACKED AT PRISON THAT ARE IN VERY REMOTE AREAS- THOSE ARE THREE FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDERED WHEN WE- IDENTIFIED OUR PRELIMINARY LIST OF PRISONS BUT THERE CERTAINLY OTHER FACTORS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- WE ALSO NOTE THAT- IN WE NOTED IN OUR REPORT ON PRISON INFRASTRUTURE WHICH WE RELEASED LAST YEAR THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION PROBABLY IS IN THE BEST POSITION. TO IDENTIFY THAT. PRISONS ARE THE STRONG CAN'T FOR CLOSURE GIVEN THAT IT'S FAR MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND- IN UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH OF THE PRESENCE. YOUR QUESTION. IT HELPS A LOT AND I APOLOGIZE. FOR MISS CHARACTERSIN THE PHRASE WITH LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE WOULD BE. I THINK THE WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS A RIGHT WAY TO. CHARACTERIZE AT- IN IN THE LIST THAT YOU HAVE BASED ON THE CREATURE YOU JUST LAID OUT IS NEVER REALLY BEEN- ADOPTED FORMALLY BY THE LEGISLATURE- OR ANYONE ELSE AT THIS POINT IS THAT. CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND FORMALLY ADOPTED OKAY THANK YOU THEM JUST CONTRIBUTE CLEAR ON THE FACTS. S. TO THOSE IN AND EVEN TO THE TO WHICH OURS ARE SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE IDENTIFIED FOR CLOSURE. I THINK THE BALANCING ACT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE YOU KNOW FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT IS- WAYNE. YOU KNOW THE RISK OR CONSEQUENCES FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT THAT YOU- APPROPRIATELY. PUT FORWARD IT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MAINTENANCE YOU WANT TO DO OR START JUST BEFORE. ONE THESE PRISONS CLOSES- AND ESPECIALLY THE TWO THAT ALREADY IDENTIFIED. WITH THE OTHER PUBLIC POLICY OF PRIORITY OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE CONDITIONS FROM AND AN ATA STANDPOINT FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE HABITABLE- CONDITIONS AND WE DON'T. HEAR THAT TERM THAT OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH PRISONS BUT SOLD. OF LEAKY ROOFS AREN'T. YOU KNOW DRIPPING ON ON INMATES OR OR- IS A GARDEN POLICE AND SO FORTH- AND I AM JUST WONDERING WHAT WE KNOW IF TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF ANYONE'S TAKEN A DEEPER DIVE A REQUESTED- BUT YOU KNOW A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CONDITIONS ARE REALLY REALLY THAT EXIGENT OR OR WHETHER THESE. MAINTENANCE CONDITIONS- KENNEDY BE PUT OFF. YOU KNOW WITHOUT EXACERBATING. OR PUTTING AT RISK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR LITIGATION OR YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ONE EXTREME OR OR EVEN JUST- UNSAFE ON HABITABLE INAPPROPRIATE IN HUMANE. CONDITIONS FOR THE FOR THE INMATES LIST AGAIN BECAUSE IF I KNOW THAT WE GO FIX A MODEL CURRICULUM FOR ONE WEEK OR ONE MONTH OR TWO YEARS WE NEED TO CORRECT THOSE KIND OF CONDITIONS IMMEDIATELY THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING WITH THAT THAT'S SURE SURE IN MY OPINION. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE OR- IF THE SYSTEM IS THE CDC OURS PROVIDING THAT KIND OF DETAIL INEXORABLY. IN A GO BACK TO MISTER ALAN ASKING P. AS A KIND OF DETAIL BUT BUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. SO THAT IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF INFORMATION THE KIND OF ASSESSMENT THAT. WE THINK THAT THE- DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO DO AND NEEDS TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE. THE CONSULTANT THAT DID AN IN DEPTH STUDY OF THE TWELVE OLDEST PRISONS DID- PROVIDE A LIST A SPECIFIC LIST OF RECOMMENDED PROJECTS. HOWEVER AND ALSO A PRIORITIZATION ORDER- HOWEVER IT'S NOT CLEAR NECESSARILY THAT THE STATE AS YOU POINT OUT. NEEDS TO PURSUE. ROGER X. FOR EXAMPLE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. GIVEN SORT OF THE INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND STANDARDS THE IF THERE WAS A FACILITY MADE OF WOOD OF WHICH THE STATE HAS A NUMBER OF- INMATE HOUSING UNITS THAT ARE KIND OF LIKE WOODEN BARRACKS- THAT THE- CONSULTANT AUTOMATICALLY RECOMMENDED REBUILDING THOSE FACILITIES. SO THAT'S A CASE WHERE IT PERHAPS THE STATE WOULD COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION ABOUT THE NEED TO REBUILD THAT FACILITY AND CDC OUR MAINTENANCE STAFF ARE THE ONES WHO ARE OF COURSE DEALING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO THEY WOULD. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR AND DIE DEPARTMENT ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT I'M SAYING TO REVIEW THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO LOOK AT THE OTHER PRESENTS. AND SAY OKAY WHAT IS REALLY IMPACTING- PEOPLE'S. MY SAFETY AND OPERATIONS OF THE PRISON AND WHAT DO WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS- FIRST ETCETERA SO THAT IS AN EXERCISE THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT TO THIS OVERALL PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT AT SOME POINT WERE- EXCEEDING THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE L. A- WOULD NORMALLY DO IN IN MAY BE A FAILURE ANALYSIS- OR AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT IN OUTSIDE OF CDC OR IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF DETAIL. IS THAT THIS UP I'M NOT ASK YOU TO ADD RECOMMENDATIONS YOU RECOMMENDATION I'M JUST ASKING IF THAT'S WITHIN THE REALM OF A POSSIBILITY A POSSIBILITY THAT. WE GO DOWN THAT PATH TO GET THAT KIND OF DETAIL. WE CAN CERTAINLY- WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO DISCUSS HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP- MOVE THINGS FORWARD- WE- I THINK IT WENT TO THE TWO FOOT TO IDENTIFY WHAT PROJECTS ARE- OUR MOST PRESSING AND ARE IN NEED FIRST ARE DEFINITELY NEEDED I DO THINK IT WOULD INVOLVE QUITE A BIT OF ON THE GROUND- INVESTIGATION AND EXPERTISE AND MAINTENANCE AND FACILITY DESIGN SO THAT WOULD BE- A CHALLENGE IS IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY IN THAT YEAR- I. HOPING WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP- TEN YEAR OLD A% LIST OF PROJECTS BUT DEFINITELY HAPPY TO- FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF YOU KNOW YOU CAN HELP I AM JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WITHOUT YOU KNOW- I'M VERY IMPRESSED BY YOUR THE FESTIVAL IL. BUT I'M ALSO. MY OWN INITIAL ANALYSIS IS THIS OR DISCERNMENT IS TELLING ME THAT AT SOME POINT WE REACH THE CAPACITY OF L. A- AND WE GET BEYOND IT WHEN WE START GETTING INTO STRUCTURAL DETAIL WERE FAILURE IS LIKELY TO OCCUR NEXT WERE. THE IMAGINEERING- IS IT IS AN ISSUE OR STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OR AN ISSUE THAT I'M JUST SICK I WAS JUST SUGGESTING AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK TO MORE OFFLINE ABOUT THAT IS TO AT WHAT POINT- DOES DOES THE LEGISLATURE JUST. FOR CALL IN. OR DIRECTOR DEMAND- RESOURCES IN ON APPROPRIATIONS TO A TO GET THAT WORK DONE YOU KNOW BY THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS WOULD SPECIALIZE IN THAT SIDE OF IT IN AND I THINK YOU JUST AFFIRMED THAT THERE THERE CERTAINLY IS A POINT WHERE IT GETS BEYOND YOUR EXPERTISE- SO I'M HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT THAT OFFLINE ONE LAST QUESTION- WANT ONE LAST QUESTION- WITH. REGARD TO. THESE LIKELY CANDIDATES AND- EVEN THE TWO SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY- THE DALLAS IS ON THE JUST ADAPTIVE RE USE. OF THOSE BUILDINGS I MEAN IS THAT EVEN A THING. IN TERMS OF OPTIONS FOR WHAT TO DO WITH THE FACILITIES AFTER THEY'RE CLOSED YEAH CORRECT WONDER PRESENT YES SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE RECOMMENDED- THAT DEPART DID LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO DO IS TO PROVIDE A LIST OF OPTIONS FOR- THE FUTURE AT LEAST TWO PRESENTS. BERMAN HAS COMMITTED TO CLOSING- FOR IT THERE ARE YOU KNOW READ REVIEWS COULD- ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY IS THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSING TO REUSE AN EXISTING CLASS CLOSED PRISON AS A TRAINING FACILITY- I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS. OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD AS FAR AS REVIEWS. BY EIGHT SORRY GO AHEAD. RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO KNOW FOR NOW IS TO HOW FAR WE'VE GOTTEN WITH THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE ASKED FOR THAT ARE SUGGESTED THAT IN- THERE'S A LIMITED. ANALYSIS SO FOR FEEDBACK- EVEN FROM CDCR I ASKED HIM IN PART BECAUSE IF THERE ARE. IN THE ADAPTIVE REUSES FOR PRISONS THAT GO BEYOND. THIS AGENCY BEYOND CDC ARE- SHOULD WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS IN THE CONTEXT TRYING TO BRING THIS BACK TO MAINTENANCE AGAIN IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE TO PUT A ROOF ON A BUILDING THAT ANOTHER AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST IN- OR IS BEING NO SURPLUS TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS A BUILDING WITH A ROOF ON IT SO THAT THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING I CAN TALK TO MORE- AS YOU SUGGESTED. OFFICE TO OFFICE SO TO WIN THE TIE UP THE WHOLE- COMMITTEE WITH THIS I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF WHAT I JUST ASKED- I DO WANT TO DENY- THIS ROMAN IS IT WILL BE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO HE TO MAKE A BRIEF RESPONSE TO ANY OF THAT OF MEDICARE IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU SURE. STONE JUST NAMING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT IT IT'S MORE THAN JUST INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU MINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT REASONS TO CLOSE IT IT'S A BIG COMPONENT BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER ISSUES- THANK WHEN FOR EXAMPLE WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE LA- BUT HAS A VERY SPECIALIZED POPULATION IN HOUSING GET THROWING ME IN AND ALSO HAS EXTREMELY GOOD- PROGRAMMING FOR INMATES AVAILABLE THERE BECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY IN THE BAY AREA- HAVE A LOT OF STAFFING OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE LOCATION SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS INVOLVED BEYOND JUST INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR THE COST TO KEEP. THE FACILITY OPERATING. AS FAR AS THE SENATE QUESTION REGARD. EVENTUALLY YOU FOR EVENTUAL TO. ON THE ADMIN. IS CONSIDERING OPTIONS WHICH IS WHY AS PART OF THAT- FUNDING FOR DUPLICATION INSTITUTE THIS YEAR WE'RE PROPOSING. TO MAINTAIN ASPECTS CERTAIN MINIMUM NUMBER OF THE CITY STAFF AT THE PLANT OPERATIONS AT THE FACILITY CAN BE MAINTAINED IN WORKING ORDER. AS WE WORK TOWARDS FINAL DISPOSITION INTENTIONAL SURPLUS OR OTHER OPTIONS FOR USE. I'M SO EVEN IF WE TO CLOSE A PRISON IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN- FACILITIES AT THAT INSTITUTION AND- FACILITY- AND AS SENATOR PER CASE YOU MENTIONED- ARE. ENTERTAINING BUT HE SAID HE WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND OFTEN CASES YEAH EMPHASIZE FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES. THINGS LIKE COLLAPSING ROOFS OR FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT REALLY CAN'T BE JUST MAINTAINED. AS A POTENTIAL CLOSURE SEVERAL YEARS OFFICE THAT IS A POSSIBILITY IT'S JUST TOO PROBLEMATIC FOR LIKE LEON LITIGATION. FOR OBVIOUSLY THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STAFF. AND INMATES AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS. I WANNA- SAY. HI KAREN I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES CARED DEEPLY ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE STAFF IN THESE PRISONS OF THE OF POPULATION THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THEM. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE NINE ARE PUTTING US IN THE POSITION OF EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD DO THE REPAIRS OR THE THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED- OUTLINED THIS IS ABOUT HAVING A MORE RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO THOSE NEEDS FULFILLING THE NEEDS OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN ARE INSIDE THE PRISONS BUT IT'S ALSO A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE AS A AS A LEGISLATURE. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THESE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTED TO A LONG TERM PRISON CLOSURE PLAN OF THE THAT WE AVOID SCENARIOS IN WHICH WE ARE MAKING UNNECESSARY INVESTMENTS AND WE UNDERSTAND WHY CERTAIN PROJECTS ARE BEING CHOSEN OVER OTHERS- SO- WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO GOT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU IDENTIFY MISTER ADLEMAN ABOUT ALL THE CONSIDERATIONS FINE. LET'S PUT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS INTO A PLAN AND MOVE US ALL FORWARD BUT WE ARE VERY MUCH LACKING IN THE KIND OF- INFORMATION THAT WE NEED THE STRATEGY THAT WE MADE AND THE KIND OF INFORMATION AND STRATEGY THAT WE WOULD EXPECT FROM ANY DEPARTMENT OF SO WITH THAT I JUST THE- YES I'M SORRY. YES YES OF COURSE THE CENTER NEWMAN. AND I APOLOGIZE SO I MY QUESTION PROBABLY DENTURES FOR SOME OF THE DIMENSIONS OF CENTER CRETACEOUS QUESTION- THERE ARE A COUPLE POSTED MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE TWO NUMBERS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THERE'S A BILLION DOLLAR. SO FRAZIER RIGHT TO SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY DIFFERENT MANAGE PROJECTS BUT THERE'S A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS SO I I'D BE CURIOUS AS TO- WHAT'S THE SPREAD BETWEEN WHAT'S YOUR WHAT EXPLAINS THAT VARIANCE. AND HOW OR HAVE TO WE HAVEN'T SEEN OUR NEW TO THIS OBVIOUSLY AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THE OFFER OF A SUMMARY OF THOSE PROJECTS VERTICALLY AS THEY ARE ATTRIBUTED TO SPECIFIC PRISONS- BUT IS IT POSSIBLE AS WELL OR IS BECAUSE IT EXIST- THAT THAT REMAINDER OF. TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS THE VARIANCES THAT ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO SPECIFIC PRESENCE BECAUSE TO MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS THERE'S CLEARLY A VERY COMPLICATED ASSESSMENT MATRIX THAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE DECISIONS OVER EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME- AND THIS WOULD BE PROBABLY WHERE I WOULD START SO AT THAT THE FAR END OF THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THOSE ARE PROBABLY. GOOD TO HAVE PROJECTS BUT NOT NECESSARY- BUT THAT ONE BILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD SEEMS PRETTY ARBITRARY SO- AS IT CREEPS INTO YOU KNOW THAT SECOND HALF OF THE THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN SEEM AT ANY GIVEN TIME- THOSE PROJECTS MIGHT BECOME MORE URGENT WE'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. IN MAKING THESE SORTS OF JUDGMENTS SO IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT- I GUESS- MISTER LEAVE FIRST- BE HELPFUL FOR US. CERTAINLY SO PERHAPS THAT ON- YEAH I THINK YOU CAN IT BIG CORRECTLY THAT THE BILLION I REPRESENTS A PROJECTS AT- INDIVIDUAL PERSONS FOR WHICH WE HAVE HAVE A SCOPE FOR THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IS MORE A- A- OKAY BASED ON DISABILITY CONDITIONS AND- BUT THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC PROJECTS- LINES- THE FACT THAT NUMBER- WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF. AGING SYSTEMS- IN IN THE PRISONS AND- YOU KNOW I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS OF HOW PROJECTS GET INTO GET INTO THE USE SO THIS REALLY STARTS IN THE FIELD AT EACH INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS. AND IS OVERSEEN BY THE CORRECTIONAL PLANT MANAGERS- AND THE WARDENS AND THEIR MAGIC MANAGEMENT TEAMS HAVE DAY TO DAY RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING SAFE AND FUNCTIONAL FACILITIES. I EACH- INSTITUTION HAS A M. I MEAN IT'S BUDGET- WHICH HAD HAS BEEN A GRANTED IT- IN RECENT YEARS- WHICH IT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT- GOING FORWARD- SO THAT MORE PROBLEMS CAN BE ADDRESSED EARLIER IN THEIR LIFECYCLE TO AVOID- MAJOR. INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES- JUMPED ON THE ROAD. ADAM MY VISION THE FACILITY ADDING INCOMES CONSTRUCTION MANAGED DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADVISING DEPARTMENTAL LEADERSHIP INFORMING PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS THAT ARE BEYOND THE ASK YOU PRISON MAINTENANCE STAFF. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- PROJECTS- WITH- INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING WRITTEN OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND- OF COURSE SERVICES AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO PRIORITIZE THE MOST CRITICAL REPAIRS- THIS INCLUDES DECIDING WHICH PROJECTS SHOULD MOVE FROM INSIDE FULL- OF THIS BILL WHICH IS THE BILLION DOLLAR LAST NIGHT INTO A DESIGN EFFORT AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY. INTO A CONSTRUCTION AFTER. IS THAT HOW DO I KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN THAT GIVES US SOME INSIGHTS RIGHT I GUESS NOW I'D SWITCH TO MISS O'NEILL. IT IT DOES SEEM AS IF BETWEEN THE CONTACTS IS CONVERSATION IT WOULD BE NOT ONLY USEFUL BUT PROBABLY NECESSARY. TO AS WE LOOK FORWARDAND CONSIDER CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE OR MERGER WE JUST HOW TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES. I'D BE VERY GOOD TO HAVE SHOWN. ATTRIBUTION OR PATH OF PORTION OF THOSE FUNDS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. SO WE WHO ARE MAKING BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE A GOOD IDEA AS TO WHAT'S FIRST PRIORITY WHAT SECOND PARTY BUT- WE CAN MEASURE THAT AGAINST. THAT SOME YOU KNOW SOME OTHER OBJECTIVES AND CONSIDERATIONS VERTICALLY CLOSURES SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BRING THAT QUICKLY THEN IT PROBABLY MOVE ON. WE SHOULD. THIS IS CAITLIN O'NEILL. I'M I'M NOT SURE I FULLY UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION IT'S A QUESTION I GUESS BORN OUT OF IGNORANCE MAYBE SO THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS HAS A TON OF MONEY- AND SO IT SEEMS WE'VE BEEN OFFERED A LIST THAT THAT THAT ACCOUNTS FOR A BILLION OF THAT THIRTEEN- BE PROBABLY HELPFUL IN SOME FASHION TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHERE THE NEXT SET OF INVESTMENTS MIGHT BE NECESSARY PARTICULARS WE CONSIDER- THE ANNUAL BUDGET THE DECISION BUT JUST IMPORTANTLY. LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD TO YOUR POINT EARLIER LIKELY CANDIDATES- FOR CONSOLIDATION RIGHT OKAY I AM I UNDERSTAND THANK YOU YES- HAVING THAT PRIORITIZATION WILL BE OF COURSE VERY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO STAGE THESE PROJECTS OVER INTENTIONALLY A DECADE OR TWO- AS A AS RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS WORK- AND SO NEED. AS A PART OF OUR RECOMMENDATION AND IS A PART OF THAT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED LAST YEAR WE RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT- ESSENTIALLY- DOING IN. OF A ALL WHAT IT KNOWS CURRENTLY BASED ON THESE VARIOUS LISTS OF PROJECTS AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION- KENNY LOOK AT HOW IT IS REALLY AFFECTING OPERATIONS IS WHAT IS THE MOST CRITICAL FIFTY ISSUES HERE- AND- A SYMBOL OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT HE SAID TO IDENTIFY AND- IDENTIFY WHAT'S THE MOST PRESSING SO WE CAN START ON THOSE BUT ALSO THIS IS. AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW THE STATE WANTS ITS PORTFOLIO OF PRISON FACILITIES TO LOOK IN THE FUTURE- DEATH SO IT REQUIRES NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT. WHAT'S THE MOST PRESSING- SAFETY CONCERNS WHICH OF COURSE WE WANTED YOU IMMEDIATELY AND ADDRESS QUICKLY- BUT ALSO WHAT WE WANT AND WHAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRISONS LOOK LIKE- HOW MANY. HIGH SECURITY FACILITIES ARE GOING TO NEED BASED ON PROJECTIONS- DO WE WANT TO CREATE A GREATER EMPHASIS ON FOR EXAMPLE FACILITIES THAT ARE DESIGNED WITH- MORE REHABILITATIVE MINDSET IN PLACE COULD WE ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL SAVINGS BY. CONSOLIDATING FACILITIES IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REBUILD THE FACILITY ANYWAY MAYBE WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE IT'S LOCATED AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT ARE SO. SO IT'S KIND OF. BOTH I. FIRST THOSE KEY PRESSING ISSUES FOR HEALTH LIFE SAFETY X. SENTARA AND ALSO THINKING LONG TERM ABOUT. IN OTHER WORDS SORT OF TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO THINK LONG TERM ABOUT- THAT FUTURE OF SUCH. A PRESENCE. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AS WELL THAT VERY WELL SO IF YOU START I GUESS I I'D LOVE TO HEAR VERY QUICKLY FOR MISTER ADELMAN- YOU'VE- HAD. MENTIONED I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF CASES HERE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED NOBODY WOULD DISPUTE THAT- BUT IT DOES SEEM REASONABLE FOR. WE THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE. SOME EXPECTATION OF GREATER INSIGHT- YOU KNOW GREATER CLARITY GRANULARITY FROM FORD SO- IF YOU COULD PLEASE SPEAK THAT THAT PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO MR O'NEILL'S COMMENTS ARE TO BE GRATEFUL. I THINK YOU HAVE FOR THE LONG TERM PLANNING FOR CAESARS CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT ACTUALLY DEFERRED TO ONE OF FONG FINANCE CAPITAL EIGHT ANALYST TO HELP ON THE LONGER TERM RISING FOR PROJECTS. IN PLANNING. THERE'S YOUR ANSWER. LET'S MOVE ON. MADAM CHAIR IF I pMAY YES GOOD. ALL THIS IS ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I DID WANT TO JUST TO CLARIFY- ONE THING ABOUT THE THIS THIS NOTION OF A LONG TERM PRISON CLOSURE PLAN WELL THE FIRST THING I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO ADJUSTING THE PRESENT CAPACITY AS WE CAN WHICH IS SAVINGS AND I THINK- THAT IS WHY YOU'RE SEEING THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED TO THE CLOSURE OF TWO PRESIDENTS I AND WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AS TRANSPARENTLY AS WE CAN- I'M PROVIDING THE NOTIFICATIONS THE LEGISLATURE AS TIMELY AS POSSIBLE- WHICH AGAIN IS WHY WE'VE COMMITTED WITH WITH- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR. PROVIDING NOTIFICATIONS THE LEGISLATURE- BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- ABOUT WHICH WHICH IS THAT WHICH PRISON WE INTEND TO CLOSE NEXT- WE WERE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION- WHICH WILL PRESENTLY INTENDS TO CLOSE FIRST WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE DVI MY ANUARY OF THIS YEAR WE DID THAT SEVERAL MONTHS EARLY I RECOGNIZE THE DESIRE FOR THIS INFORMATION EVERYONE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PLAN. ACCORDINGLY AND WE HAVE DONE SO- I DO WANT pNOTION THAT- WE HAVE YOU KNOW THIS THIS SHORT LIST OR THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH A SHORT LIST OF PRISONS THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE FLOWS IN THE FUTURE- YOU KNOW OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT AT THIS POINT- WE CAN ONLY COMMIT TO CLOSING TWO PRESENTS- THE THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY UNKNOWNS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SAY FOR CERTAIN WILL BE ABLE TO CLOSE AN ADDITIONAL. THREE PRISONS IS THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTS OR EVEN EVEN OFF A THIRD ONE BEYOND THE SECOND THE TWO THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED- IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS A PANDEMIC WHICH IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPACT ALL OPERATIONS WITHIN CDCR- IT'S INCREASED THE NEED FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING OUR INSTITUTIONS. I'M SO I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT- TOO SIMPLISTIC TO SIMPLY LOOK AT THE POPULATION. TRENDS AND SAY WELL THE POP IS DOWN TODAY AND WE EXPECT TO BE DOWN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD BE. AND IDENTIFY PRISONS FOR CLOSURE- WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT SHE ACTUALLY HAVE AND I IS BY TO BE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRISONS STATE- AND WE HAVE. FOR THE JUST WITHIN THOSE INSTITUTIONS. ARE IN OBVIOUSLY CALL PRISON MAKES THAT MUCH MORE. SO THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT'S AT THE TOP OF OUR- FIVE THINKING IT AS WE WERE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT WHAT THE- JUSTIN SHOULD BE TO PRISON CAPACITY IN THE FUTURE. THE OTHER THING I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR IS THAT THE PRACTICE OF. PROJECTING WHAT THE- POPULATION BE IN THE FUTURE- IS A VERY DIFFICULT ONE- IT APARTMENTS I HAS A VERY SOPHISTICATED MODEL AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT PREDICTING WHAT THE POPULATION WILL BE. ONE OR TWO YEARS IN THE FUTURE. BUT ONCE YOU GET BEYOND THAT TIME RISE IN THE START OF MY THREE FOUR YEARS- FIVE YEARS. IT IS A VERY DICEY PROPOSITION AND THAT'S NOT AN INDICTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENTS IT'S JUST A REFLECTION IF YOU LOOK BACK YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST. TEN FIFTEEN YEARS HAVE BEEN SO MANY POLICY CHANGES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. I'VE BEEN IN CHANGES IN THE CRYPT AND CRIME TRENDS THAT REALLY IMPACT OF THE PRISON POPULATION SO. FOR US TO BE SITTING HERE IN PLANNING TODAY WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE A PRISON THREE YEARS BASED ON A POPULATION PROJECTION. IS NOT REALLY SOMETHING WE'RE COMFORTABLE. DOING AT THIS POINT IN TIME. TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES. AND AS WAS NOTED BY MY COLLEAGUE THERE ARE- MAJOR RAM OF. PETITIONS OPPOSING PRESENTS MAJOR IMPACTS FOR THE STAFF THAT WORK THERE- FOR THE INMATES THAT ARE IN THOSE. FACILITIES AND FOR THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND WE DO NOT WANT TO START ON A PATH. TO DO THAT UNTIL WE'RE 1100% SURE THAT WE CAN DO THAT SO- JUST WANTED TO SHOW. RESPECT ABOUT THE PRISON CLOSURE PLAN AGAIN WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTING GETTING US- IT'S- DEFINITELY TOP OF OUR MINDS WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING US AS WE CAN- BUT WE DO NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT. MAKING A LOT OF THOSE LONG TERM DETERMINATIONS. TO DEFEND WITH. THANK YOU. SIR I COULD I'D APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK WE RESPECT. PROSPECTIVE CLOSE. BUT I WANT MAKE CLEAR THAT THINK I THINK IT'S BECAUSE- THAT THAT'S NOT OUR- SO FRAMER. HERE IT ALSO INCLUDES. HOW DO WE HAVE AN ON GOING BASIS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE QUESTION. THANKS MARC DECISIONS ON PRIORITIZING BUDGET FUNDS AGAINST THIS VERY LARGE NUMBER- THAT HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO- IN SO IT IT IT YOU KNOW IT MAY NOT BE THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS BUT IT'S ALSO DEFINITELY NOT ONE BILLION EITHER IT'S PROBABLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SO WE NEED BETTER CONTEXT I THINK- FOR MAKING MAKES THOSE SORTS OF. DECISIONS ON IT SO WE CAN MAKE GOOD ALLOCATIONS- AND GET MAXIMUM VALUE FOR THOSE LOCATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK WHAT I'M AT LEAST WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS A MUCH MORE. INTEGRATED BOB PLANNING AND STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE. OF OF- CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND OUR PRISON SYSTEM. MEAN THE. PRISON POPULATION IS GOING DOWN. AND OUR- OF POLICIES AND ACROSS THE STATE AND I THINK ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO- WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR RESPONSE IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT I'M LOOKING FOR IS HOW DOES THIS ALL FIT IN. AND IT'S GOTTA MAKE SENSE ALL TOGETHER IN AN INTEGRATED WAY AND I FEEL LIKE WE'RE REALLY IN THE DARK HERE AND WE'RE BEING ASKED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT OF MAKING THESE SOME EXPENDITURES- BUT WE'RE REALLY IN THE DARK ABOUT. THE UP WITH THE FULL PICTURE FOR US TO MAKE THE MOST RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE WE ARE HERE TO DO. SO- OKAY SORRY NOT WATCHING HERE- YES FINANCED PLEASE. FRIEDMAN ROBIN HARSH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND JUSTIN EDELMAN RECENTLY REFERRED- DEFERRED TO THE CAP OUT LAKE COUNTERPARTS AND I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND SLIGHTLY TO THAT QUESTION THERE IS AND- FIVE YEAR PLAN THAT'S RELEASED WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- IF THE CENTERS ARE NOT AWARE OF THAT WE COULD POINT IN THAT DIRECTION BUT IT DOES INCLUDE ONLY CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTIONS FOR FIVE YEARS IT'S NOT APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY- BUT IT'S A SORT OF PLANT. AND IT DOES NOT- INCLUDING THE FIVE NINE X. SEPARATE IS CAPTURED IN THE MULTI YEAR. OKAY I HAD TO HAVE ONE SPECIFIC ONE ON THE ROOF REPAIRS HERE'S A LIST OF THE CURRENT ROOF REPAIRS THAT ARE BEING- ON COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT THE- AMOUNT OF FUNDING. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S GOING INTO THE CURRENT. ROOF REPAIRS IS.

OF IS THAT WHAT THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR CORRECT YES THAT'S WHAT THAT AMOUNTS TO OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH SENATORS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS NO OKAY I'M SURE IF I CAN JUST MAKE IT A COMEDY DOES IF IT DOES NOT PROMPT ANY FURTHER RESPONSE BUT- LISTEN CAREFULLY TO OF SOME SOME OF THE LAST- COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TO US. THE LAST SPEAKERS OF AT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE- HE UPON THIS. PRISON POP CAN DRIVEN ALLEGE. POLICY IT ISN'T SO UNPREDICTABLE IF IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE TAKES UP THE NOTION. OF THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE POPULATION REDUCTION TARGETS IN THE PRESENCE AND- I MEAN THAT'S THAT AND THEN WORK BACK IN TERMS OF ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES SO- I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT AS WE ARE POWERLESS IN TERMS OF DETERMINING. WHAT THE POPULATION IS FIVE YEARS FROM NOW AS A STATE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY THAT RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OPEN- LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE- CDC ARE WHO IS THAT GOING TO BE.

TO ENSURE CUTS ARE OF THE AVAILABLE SERVICE ALTERNATIVES A CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS A REAL ID AUTOMATED DOCUMENT VERIFICATION PROJECT BETTER NOT AS RAPIDLY HERE THE ANTI. FEATHER RANGE OF ONLINE CHAT SERVICES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO DMB SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE FIELD OFFICES. THIS REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES THE ONGOING NEED FOR FUNDING FOR OPERATIONAL PREVENTS THAT WERE MADE IN RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT CONDUCTED BY THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS- SIGN.

AND THE VAST NUMBER OF PERMITS DEPARTMENT HAS INITIATED TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE DMV. THANK YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LET'S NOT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FINANCE. COMMENTS. YES MA'AM THE MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RESPOND TO- KIND OF LA- RECOMMENDATIONS- TO ONLY PROVIDE ONE YEAR OF FUNDING FOR THE REAL ID. PART OF THE PROPOSAL- I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT WHILE THERE IS UNCERTAINTY OVER THE DEMAND DUE TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS WELL AS A- POSSIBLE PENDING FEDERAL REGULATIONS WE DO KNOW THAT THE DEMAND STILL EXISTS- IN DENYING RELATED RESOURCES AFTER FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WILL LIMIT. VISIBILITY TO CLAM PROCESSING RELATE THESE IN THOSE OUT YEARS- I KNOW WITH THAT TRADITION AFTER ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED- TO MEET THE DEMANDS- IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OR LATER. SIMILAR TO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE PROPOSED BUDGET WILL LIKELY CONTAIN. LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS US TO. AUGMENT DMV'S BUDGET SHOULD WE NEED TO DO THAT. OKAY CON ELLO ELLO COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR EUNICE ROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AT SO WE FIND THAT THAT REQUEST FOR THE OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPROVEMENT IN IT IMPROVEMENTS IT'S REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TO BE SAN VALUATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPARTMENT PERFORMANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE ADDITIONAL RESEARCHERS HAVE HAD POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE DEPARTMENT'S OPERATIONS. HOWEVER AS FINANCED AS NOTED WE DO FIND THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATE FOR THAT TEMPORARY FIELD OFFICE STAFF REQUIRED AND ACCELERATE COSTS AT ADDRESSING THE REAL ID WORKLOAD ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS SOME OF WHICH ARE FAIRLY UNSER AND SOUTH. AND THESE FACTORS INCLUDE POTENTIAL FEDERAL REGULATE LIKE REGULATORY CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE IF. THE REAL ID DEADLINE IS FURTHER EXTENDED- A TO OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR IN THE PANDEMIC IF. ASK BOOKS ARE LESS COMFORTABLE GOING INTO THE FIELD OFFICE OR FEEL LESS TIME. AT FEEL THAT GETTING A REAL ID IS LESS NECESSARY BECAUSE FOLKS ARE TRAVELING LESS. AND IT KIND OF JUST LONG TERM CUSTOMER PREFERENCES AT FOUR- SERVICES AT THE END B. I'M SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE POSITIONS OF FUNDING FOR THE CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN NINETEEN PROCESS- WHICH TOTALED ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION AND HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILE FIVE POSITIONS IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I'M BUT WE DO WORK THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED ON THE BUDGET YOUR POSITIONS AND FUNDING FOR THE REAL ID WORKLOADS AND- ADD GIVEN THE WORKLOAD UNCERTAINTY I WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING. THE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION AND FOURTEEN NINETY THREE POSITIONS FOR REAL YOU WORK WITH FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND IN THIS WAY. AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT WORKLOAD BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT COME BACK NEXT YEAR WITH THE NEW FUNDING POSOF I WHICH COULD BE INFORMED BY ANOTHER YEAR OF- DATA ANSWERING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR I THOUGHT- POSSIBLE FEDERAL ACTION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- MAYBE THIS IS JUST KIND OF TO WALK ME THROUGH THIS BUT I KNOW RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND THEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCES- WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO STAY HOME WE'RE SAYING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE THIS THE SPREAD- BUT YET ON THE OTHER HAND ARE I DON'T KNOW HOW AGGRESSIVE ARE YOUR EFFORTS ARE YOU TRYING TO GET THEM TO GO IN AND GET THEIR REAL ID. BECAUSE WE HAVE A PENDING OCTOBER DEADLINE RIGHT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- I KNOW HOW THIS IS ALL WORKING NOW IT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO- PUSHING PEOPLE PEOPLE TO GO IN BUT THEN OF KNOWING THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT IN GENERAL THAT'S NOT WHAT WE NEED- SO THAT'S JUST ONE IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT OF THE OTHER IS- I'M REALLY. CONCERNED- ABOUT NOT ONLY PAST EXPERIENCES WITH THE DM B. R. BUT- THE NUMBER IN THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE. AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECT WHAT HOW MANY MILLION PEAK MILLIONS OF PEOPLE YOU EXPECT TO. OF PROCESS BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER APPROXIMATELY OCTOBER BUT AS THE PANDEMIC LOOSENS UP GOD WILLING. ALL ON THE RESTRICTIONS MORE PEOPLE WILL WANT TO TRAVEL BILL REALIZE THAT THEY NEED A REAL ID. AND THEN THEY'LL START OF FLOODING SO I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. ARE THESE RESOURCES GOING TO MEET THE DEMAND. OF THAT WE'RE EXPECTING FOR REAL ID CUSTOMERS- WE HAVE TO AVOID YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF A WAIT LINE- CRISIS. AND DO YOU HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. TO KEEP UP WITH THAT DEMAND. YES THANK YOU MEDICARE'S A STEEP GARDEN THAT DIRECTOR AT DMV- GOOD ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW KIND OF IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO PULL PEOPLE INTO THE CURRENT PERIOD WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE. SEPARATED IN HAND HOW SOCIAL DISTANCING I WOULD CONCUR WITH YOU THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY ATTACKING RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH THE DEADLINE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS STILL OCTOBER FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO THAT IS A HARD STOP AT THIS MOMENT HOW BAHRAINI CHANGE AND IN THAT IN THAT GOAL SO AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE OFFICE WHAT WE'RE DOING THOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT'S BEEN IN THE OFFICE. YOUR NUMBER OF ACTIVE HE HEARD THE SO CALLED RAD V. P. SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT PROPERLY BRANDING THAT BUT REALLY WHAT THAT DOES IS ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO DO THEIR PREPARATION WORK AT HOME ALLOWS HIM TO UPLOAD THEIR DOCUMENTS BE PRECHECK SO TO SPEAK TO MAKE SURE THE DOCUMENTS ARE. COMPLETE AND VALID FOR- FOR THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE SO WHEN THEY DO COME INTO THE OFFICE YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE STOP THEIR THEIR STAY THERE COULD BE EXPEDITED SO COULD MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE THEY WOULD HAVE. SO WE ARE TAKING BACK FOR THE TECHNOLOGY QUESTION YOU HE ENDED WITH WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO REALLY FOCUS ON MINIMIZING THE THAT TOUCHES WE HAVE IN THE OFFICE TRYING TO GO TOWARDS A- A NO TOUCH EXPERIENCE WHICH IS KIND OF THE NORM TODAY- IN. IN RETAIL I THINK WE'VE DONE A FAIRLY GOOD JOB WE HAVE ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR TRANSACTION FOR REAL ID GOING THROUGH THE STOCK IS NO TOUCH PROCESS TODAY SO THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THAT TO YOU KNOW MAYBE 50% MAYBE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. DEPENDING ON OUR ABILITY TO REACH THAT POPULATION WHICH IS PART OF THE CHALLENGE SO THAT YOUR QUESTION DO WE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GET OUT PEOPLE CROWDED IN OFFICE APPS ENTRIES ABSOLUTE NOT JUST NOT SAFE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. IT'S NOT SAFER FOR THE PUBLIC BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE A VOTING THAT'S GIVEN THE DHS- DEADLINE SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PREPARE FOR THAT EVENTUALITY IF IT'S GOING TO STILL BE THIS YEAR. TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO THAT SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. SO YOU MENTIONED ABOUTTHE REAL ID NUMBERS I THINK LEE MENTIONED THAT. IT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION IS THAT WHAT WE SPECTER HOW BLACK. OF THIS YEAR. NOW BE ABOUT A SICK MILLION TO. SIXTY DELTA. WHERE WE ARE NOW AND WHERE WOULD BE. THAT'S BY THE END OF SEPT. SO THAT REPRESENTS A- SIGNIFICANT. IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD SEE. ON A MONTHLY BASIS YOU KNOW SO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF GET NINE MONTHS LEFT. AT LEAST SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND UP FOLKS WE HAVE TO SEE TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT NUMBER. THAT'S ABOUT TO ACCEPT OR SEEN TODAY SO. THERE IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW SOME CROWDING OUR JOB NOW IS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PREPARED LIKE I SAID WE WANT TO GET THEM SLOTTED IN SCHEDULED. AND WE'VE ENHANCED BACK TO THE TECHNOLOGY POINT. WE'VE ENHANCED THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW SCHEDULE PEOPLE. CANCEL THE ABILITY TO BE A- REMOTE CHECK IN TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAVE A SLOT FOR YOU AT A GIVEN TIME. GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO BETWEEN NOW AND THE END AND SUMMER TO GET THAT THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE SCHEDULING. AND THE- CUSTOMERS USING THEIR SOLUTIONS WHERE WE WANT TO BUT I THINK WE HAVE THOSE. ELEMENTS SET UP TODAY. AND OUR JOB NOW IS TO REALLY. SCALE AND BUILD ON TOP OF THIS. OKAY SENATORS ANYMORE. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. GOOD NO. NO OKAY WELL- I AM A I HAVE TO SAY THAT. I'M A LITTLE ANXIOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE A- NOR GOVERNMENT IS A YOU KNOW OUR PUBLIC CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON THE SERVICES AND PARTICULARLY NOW WITH THE WITH THE DMB- WE SAW SORT OF- IN THE PAST AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS- WHAT A FRUSTRATING AND DISASTROUS EXPERIENCE IT IS FOR FOLKS WHO I REALLY WANT TO URGE YOU. WHATEVER YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS AND THAT IT WORKS RIGHT- THAT YOU YOU DO EVERYTHING. THAT YOU POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS RIGHT. THANK YOU MANAGER OKAY GREAT THIS ITEM IS- BEING HELD OPEN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE. OF THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. OKAY ISSUE NINE OUR TRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT ACT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM CHAD ADDISON CHIEF DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR RAIL AND TRANSIT IT'S THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND I'D LKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE BILL RELATED TO THE TRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT. I'M THE BILL IS FOCUSED ON A FEW KEY GOALS FIRST THE BILL EXTENDS. MANY OF THE CODED RELATED RELIEF THAT CONTAINED IN YEAR'S NINE AND IF YOU WANT SEVEN FOR ONE I JUST FISCALLY. THIS TIME WAIVES. THAT WERE CAUSE TRêN AGENCY TO BE OUR LESS FUNDING FOR TO WHICH SHE- CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO OUR COSTS COMPARED DR COME RATIO. THANK IN THE BILL REQUIRES THE TRANSPORTATION TO PROVIDE REPORT I JUST. IDENTIFYING UP TO STREAMLINE THE DATA SUBMISSIONS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH REPORTING AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT THE PLANTS. THIRTY THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SIMPLIFIES. ELIGIBILITY TESTS RELATED TO AGENCIES SPENDING STATE FUNDING OPERATIONS THOSE AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE LOCAL FUNDING LEVELS AT OR ABOVE. THOSE PROVIDED IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS IS FOR A FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND IT OPENS THE DOOR. TO MORE FUNDING CERTAINTY AND FLEXIBILITY IN HOW TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THE TRANSIT OPERATORS. THE INNOVATION ENCOURAGED BY THIS PROVISION MAY NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE UNDER CURRENT PARADOX RECOVERY. REQUIREMENTS AND THE OUTCOMES OF THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE EVALUATED FOR EFFECTIVENESS AFTER FIVE YEARS. FINALLY THE BILL EXCLUDES FOR THE CALCULATION OF FAREBOX RECOVERY IN OPERATING COSTS PER HOUR THE COST OF RISK REQUIRING MANDATED AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT SERVICE TO THE PROVISION OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FIXED ROUTE. SERVICES FANSERVICE IT ALSO EXCLUDES MISCALCULATIONS THE COST OF FLEXIBLE ROUTE SERVICE- THAT SO THAT SO THAT THERE IS MORE ABILITY TO INNOVATE AND EXPANSION OF SERVICE INTO NEW AREAS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT CANNOT SUPPORT A FULL FIXED ROUTE. BUS SERVICE. IN SUMMARY THIS BILL REDUCES REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MAPPED FOR LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OF THEIR FORMULA BASED FUNDING. AND BY HAVING MORE CERTAINTY THAT FUNDS COULD BE SPENT ON OPERATIONS IN THE COMING YEARS. AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO FUNDING CHOICES THAT WOULD REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO FOR LOW WORKERS REDUCE SERVICES. AND ALSO PURSUE INNOVATIVE WAYS OF SERVING THEIR ENTIRE COMMUNITY WITH FLEXIBLE SERVICE TYPES WERE FIXED ROUTE BUS SERVICE IS NOT EFFECTIVE OR EFFICIENT. LAST SUMMER A GLAD TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS WITH SOMETHING. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FINANCE LEASE. HELLO THIS. THINKING I'M SURE SIOUX FALLS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I ALWAYS WANT TO CURRY WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL IS PRUDENT AND NECESSARY AT THIS TIME WE BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE DOES ALLOW FOR LOCALS TO HAVE MORE INNOVATION AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO- LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS THEY CAN EXPAND THEIR SERVICE AND THAT ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS THE SERVICE DELIVERY THAT- WILL LIKELY BE NECESSARY IN THE POST. ENDEMIC ENVIRONMENT. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER WELLS I L. A- PLEASE. I'M NOT I'M HERE AND YOU MISTER WITH THE L. A. ASKED SO. I GENERALLY WE AGREED THAT THE LANGUAGE SEEMS REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH THAT- LEGISLATIVE ACTION TAKEN LAST YEAR FOR. REGULATORY RELIEF WITH TRANSIT AGENCIES AND AS THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS NOTICED SOME OF THE REGULATORY RELIEF THAT EXTENDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER WHETHER THEY'RE ON THE GENERATION OF REGULATORY RELIEF ALIGNS WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- ON. THE SAFEWAY FROM- DALY OWES- COMMENT HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT OF THE TRANSIT AGENCIES TO NEED THIS KIND OF STATUTORY. RELIEF AND- ARE THERE OTHER CHANGES THAT WE COULD LOOK AT SO THAT YOU COULD GET THE RELIEF FOR FLEXIBILITY THAT YOU NEED OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO. DO ALL WE CAN TO BE HELPFUL TO THE- TRANSIT AGENCIES. YES ON THE GENERATION OF THE RELIEF WE- KNOW THAT AT LEAST ONE MORE YEAR OF HEALTH WOULD BE. ADDED IN REGARDS TO HOW TO CALCULATE THE FUNDING RECEIVED BY AGENCIES IN THE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS- WE WOULD BE GLAD TO- WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ACT TO IDENTIFY WHETHER ADDITIONAL RELIEF MIGHT BE MIGHT BE ALSO WARRANTED AT THIS TIME- SO I'VE RIGHT NOW WE ARE WE THINK THAT ON AT LEAST ONE MORE YEAR IS WARRANTED FIRST GETS YOU THROUGH A FULL ARE AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IN TERMS OF FUNDING ALLOCATION. AND I THINK THE COMING MONTHS WILL INFORM US MORE IS TO IS TO HOW MUCH LONGER THAT RELIEF MIGHT BE NECESSARY ONCE WE SEE THE PERFORMANCE OF TRANSIT IN THE COMING MONTHS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES CENTERS.

FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH US THE COMMISSION IS THE INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE ELEVEN APPOINTED VOTING COMMISSIONERS TO NON VOTING LEGISLATIVE EX OFFICIO COMMISSIONERS AND A SMALL STAFF OF ABOUT THREE DOZEN.

TO AT LEAST THE AVERAGE THEY SPENT DURING THE TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN THROUGH 200-011-1250 YEARS. AFTER THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. THE COMMISSION BEGAN RECEIVING FEEDBACK FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES. REGARDING THEIR POTENTIAL INABILITY TO MEET THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENT. THE GENERAL FUND REVENUES WERE DECLINING AND THEY NEEDED TO DEDICATE THOSE RESOURCES TOWARDS ADDRESSING HOPE IN NINETEEN. IN THE MONTHS AFTERWARDS TO COMMISSION STAFF FACILITATED NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH THE WORKGROUP. CONSISTING OF STAKEHOLDERS AND INDUSTRY GROUPS TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE- CONCLUDED THAT SUSPENDING THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENT FOR THAT NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR WAS APPROPRIATE SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN SUDDENLY IN THE FISCAL YEAR WAS ALREADY OVER. THE GROUP FURTHER RECOMMENDED THAT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEARS THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR EACH CITY AND COUNTY. PROPORTIONATE TO THE LOSS OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES EXPERIENCED. THIS TARGETED APPROACH INTERESTED CITIES AND COUNTIES DO NOT LOSE CRITICAL STATE FUNDS FOR THEIR ROADS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NEED FOR THESE RESOURCES- AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA- THAT YOU'RE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WE'VE HAD MORE THAN A ONE HUNDRED AND 50% INCREASE IN REQUESTS FOR SERVICE CONCERNING ENCAMPMENTS- I RECOGNIZE THAT BOTH THE STAFF AND ELLIE- RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ITEM CONCLUDE THAT THE REQUEST IS WARRANTED. BUT IT MAY BE TEMPORARY OR THE NEED MAY BE TEMPORARY BASED ON THE CURRENT SURGE AND THE FACT THAT THE STATE IS DOING ITS- BEST EFFORTS TO REDUCE INSTANCES OF HOMELESSNESS- I THINK- THAT RECOMMENDATION IS- FOR TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM OF- APPROPRIATIONS PROBABLY PRUDENT. I'M FROM OUR STANDPOINT IT WOULD BE REALLY THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME IF WE DIDN'T NEED THESE RESOURCES IN TWO YEARS AND- INSTANCES OF HOMELESSNESS ON THREE RIGHT AWAY WERE REDUCED IT WOULD BE JUST THE BEST REVERIE BODY. SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE ALL WITH YOUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER TECH- FINANCE. BENJAMIN CALLING PERMANENT FINANCE. WE WOULD AGREE WITH THE POINTS MADE BY STEPHEN CAC IN TERMS OF- THE TO YOUR RECOMMENDATION WE BELIEVE THESE RESOURCES WOULD BE NEEDED ON GOING- BUT- TO REEVALUATE IN TWO YEARS WE CAN WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO MONITOR EXPENDITURE LEVELS AND- COME BACK TO DISCUSS FURTHER. THANK YOU OF AND THE ALEJO. THANK YOU CHAIR AND SO YES THAT AS THE DEPARTMENT- HAS NOTED THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE REQUEST AND THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS THAT THE WORK WITH THIS WARRANT TEN HOWEVER AND WE JUST HAVE A SMALL TECHNICAL ISSUE WITH THAT PROPOSAL THE ESTIMATES OF THE ANNUAL COST OF HUNDRED AND THIS YEAR- IF YOU'RE OVER BILL WILL IS BASED ON THAT LIMITED TO TWENTY WEEKS OF CONTRACT SERVICES- AND- THE EXPENDITURE RATE- FROM SUCH A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME WAS EXPANDED TO. AN ANNUAL RATE AND THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC HAS LIMITED CLEAN IT CAN'T CLEAN UP ACTIVITY IN MORE RECENT MONTHS. ARE AND WHILE THAT THAT MAKES SENSE INCOMPLETE AND ANNUAL EXPENDITURE DATA MY IN ACCURATELY CAPTURE THE COSTS OF THE FULL SERVICE SAYS FOR EXAMPLE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE LAST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE COMPLETE ANNUAL DATA CALTRANS SPENT ABOUT FOURTEEN POINT NINE MILLION FRANKAMP THERE REMOVAL WHICH IS STILL LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE REQUESTING THIS PROPOSAL. SO GIVEN THIS KIND OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND ONGOING COST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING. OKAY I JUST- ONE IS A COMMENT THAT- THE MR CARE ACT THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW THAT- IN MY DISTRICT- FORTUNATE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE MANY MANY OF FREEWAYS- AND OUT WE ARE ALWAYS CALLING ON A TO GET- TO GET YOUR SYSTEMS AND IN THE CLEAN UP SO IT'S A REALLY. BIG ISSUE. R. FOR THAT REASON AND IN MY DISTRICT- BUT I JUST WANT TO ASK AND- ARE YOU KNOW HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU I'M SURE YOU ARE BUT- YOUR WORKLOAD ESTIMATES- HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU ABOUT THOSE AND- YOU REALLY THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT- THAT YOU NEED. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION- WE'RE AS CONFIDENT AS WE CAN BE IN THE IN THIS REQUEST- AS WAS NOTED BY THE L. A. WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON LIMITED DATA THAT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT CONFUSED BY THE CURRENT KOBE CRISIS- CERTAINLY I THINK ADAM. THE PROPOSAL TO DO THIS FOR JUST TWO YEARS WOULD HELP. ALLEVIATE ANY- ISSUES WERE MIGHT HAVE WITH UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARD TO THEIR QUEST BUT- WE'RE FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS THE LEVEL THAT WE NEED. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS YES FEMIGRA DOESN'T IS IMAGES SAYS PROCEDURE IS THIS ITEM THE- TO BE HELD OPEN TODAY YES OKAY GREAT THEN I CAN FIGURE JUST AS FOR INFORMATION BE BROUGHT BACK- IN. WHAT WOULD REALLY HELP ME A LOT AS UNDER UNDERSTANDING- OF CONTEXT A LITTLE BIT MORE I'VE I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND HAS MY ROOF REMOVAL. AND I'M SATISFIED HEARING THE- YOU KNOW THE TESTIMONY TODAY THE ANALYSIS I SHOULD SAY THAT. THE NUMBERS ARE- THEN THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN WELL THOUGHT OUT WHAT IT WHA I DON'T UNDERSTAND ENTIRELY IS- IS. BECAUSE THE SEQUENCE AND IN TRIGGERING OF THESE ACTIVITIES IN OTHER WORDS IS ARE WE ONLY GOING INTO REMOVE HAZMAT AFTER- THERE'S BEEN A SWEEP OR AN ABANDONMENT OF ENCAMPMENT- AND THEN ONLY AFTER CALTRANS MAINTENANCE STAFF IS GONE IN AND REMOVED OTHER DEBRIS LEAVING ONLY THE HAZMAT. SO JUST GIVING EXAMPLES OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE WHEN I SEE CONTACTS SEQUENCES SORT OF. REGIS ISOLATING THIS ONE ISSUE OF HAZMAT WHERE I DON'T I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND- NOT SO MUCH THE METRICS. BUT- YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH YOU CAN'T MISS THIS PIECES IS COMING IN IT SO WE COULD GET- YOU KNOW THAT INFORMATION BACK A WIN THE ITEM COMES BACK THAT WOULD BE. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT WHO WILL WORK ON THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- I JUST WANT TO INVITE- THANKING YOU VERY MUCH FOR- YOUR RESPONSIVENESS AND IN OUR DISTRICT AND- I KNOW IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. TO GET- YOU KNOW TO GET IT DONE AS QUICKLY AS WE HAVE BEEN USED TO IN THE PAST BUT HOPEFULLY WITH THESE RESOURCES- YOU'LL BE ABLE TO- RESPOND TO THE INCREASE IN IN REQUEST SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THAT YOU DO. THANK YOU. OKAY THIS IS A TO BE HELD OPEN. REMOVE ON TO ITEM. OR IS IT. TOO YES HERE WE GO- ITEM TWELVE OFFICE SPACE RELATED COSTS. THANK YOU SENATOR STEVEN CHECKED AGAIN WITH CALTRANS- SO WITH THIS REQUESTED WE ARE. ASKING FOR A ONE TIME NCREASES SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING RESOURCES OF NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY- FOR OFFICE SPACE MODIFICATIONS AND MOBILE WORKFORCE TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO TELEWORK AND TO FURTHER EXPLORE INNOVATIONS RELATED TO HOUSING OUR EMPLOYEES. THIS REQUEST IS THE SECOND AND FINAL REQUEST RELATED TO HOUSING ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES THAT WERE HIRED ON AS WE CONTINUE TO HIRE ON. A TO PERFORM- A GREAT DEAL OF ADDITIONAL WORK- FUNDED THROUGH SENATE BILL ONE THE ROAD REPAIR AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT- THE CURRENT PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING ALL THOSE TOGETHER HAS PREVENTED- PRESENTED A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES- BUT IT'S ALSO A WHILE CALTRANS TO EXPERIMENT AND PROVES THAT. WE CAN'T REALLY HANDLE- HELLO WORK ON A SCALE THAT WE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT WAS POSSIBLE BEFORE. AND WHAT THIS I ALLOWED US TO DO AND HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO DO. IS TO. BARCLAYS DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO ALLOWS FOR US TO- MORE CREATIVELY USE OUR EXISTING OFFICE SPACE TO OBVIATE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL EXPENSIVE OFFICE SPACE. BY UTILIZING- TELEWORK. PRACTICES SO BY DOING THIS ALTERNATELY WE HOPE TO REDUCE IN THE FUTURE NEED FOR INCREASED OFFICE SPACE WHICH MAKES THIS RELATIVELY SMALL INVESTMENT- ARE MUCH CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN. THANK YOU- BINANCE. HI JAMES OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE CAN COVER OF CALTRANS I THINK IT'S A PRUDENT STEP IN EXPANDING AND ENHANCING- CALTRANS ABILITY TO TELEWORK AND- FURTHER INNOVATE AS- THE DEPARTMENT SAID. THANK YOU AND L. A- PLEASE. AT YES WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNED WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL THE REQUEST SEEMS REASONABLE AND PREDATES DEPEND THAT MAKE AND HOW TRANSFERRED TO ACCOMMODATE THE ADDITIONAL I'M STAFF ASSOCIATED WITH SB ONE IN THE EXISTING- OFFICE SPACE GIVEN CALTRANS- IS THAT LARGE STATE DEPARTMENT AND IN MAY OF BE ASKED LEGISLATIVE ENTRANCE TO. KEEP AN ON GOING AT OVERSIGHT OF CALTRANS DECISIONS INTO AND- ADD TELEWORK OR AND THEIR INNOVATIVE WORK STRATEGIES CAN MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU I JUST HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION I ASSUME- MISTER CAKE THAT THIS EXPERIENCE OF- HOPEFULLY LEADS YOU TO MORE LONG TERM PLAN. FOR VIRTUAL OR OR TELEWORK IS HOPEFULLY IT'S MERGING INTO SOMETHING THAT'S BEYOND THE EVEN THE LENGTH OF THE PANDEMIC. YES ABSOLUTELY SANDERS THANK YOU- AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S JUST NOTED- OUR INITIAL REQUEST I IMAGINE THIS WAS THE SECOND AND FINAL REQUEST OUR INITIAL REQUEST TO LOOK INTO THIS TO EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO USE OUR OWN SPACE BETTER- IT PREDATED THE COBIT CONDEMNING. AND WHAT THIS PANDEMIC IS REALLY DONE IS ALLOW US TO- IN PERHAPS A LITTLE EARLIER THAN WE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE EXPECTED BUT IT'S ALLOWED US TO. REALLY DO A LARGE SCALE EXPERIMENT AND PROVE THAT THIS CAN BE DONE OR APARTMENT LIKE OURS SO- THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FEEDING INTO OUR LONG TERM PLANS- AND YOU KNOW IF WE'RE IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL WE CAN MODEL THE WAY. FOR OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO REALLY ULTIMATELY REDUCING OUR OVERALL PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT. GREAT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS ITEM IS- HELD OPEN. AND WILL MOVE NOW TO ISSUE THIRTEENTH WHICH IS HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY PROPERTY FUND.

YES ALREADY REQUEST TO INCREASE THE ANNUAL BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATION FROM THIS FIND. FROM SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. AND AFTER THAT THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION WOULD BE REDUCED TO TWO POINT FIVE MILLION PER YEAR. THIS REQUEST IS DUE TO THE FINE BALANCE GROWING TO ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE AUTHORITY HAVING FUTURE EXPENSES RELATED TO PROPERTY ATRE. FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE AUTHORITY HAS HISTORICALLY USED THESE FUNDS FOR COST RELATED TO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE THESE EXPENDITURES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER ELLIS- FINANCE PLEASE. MATTHEW MYSTERIO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL JUST NOTE THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL- DOES HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE RELATED COSTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT USING THE FOR THE MONIES IN THIS FUND- IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE OF HIGH SPEED RAILS FUNDS SOURCES. THANK YOU LMAO. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN BROWN WITH THE L. A. L. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE FUND HAS A SUFFICIENT BALANCE TO HANDLE THE INCREASED PROPOSED AUGMENTATION AND THE AUTHORITY HAS IDENTIFIED PROJECTS WE THINK ARE REASONABLE FOR A FOR AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU- I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION DOES THE AUTHORITY. CURRENTLY MANAGE ANY PROPERTIES OUTSIDE OF THE INITIAL INITIAL CONSTRUCTION A SEGMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- I'M TRYING TO AB WHERE WE'RE COURSE BUILDING BETWEEN- MADERA AND POPLAR AVENUE NORTH OF BAKERSFIELD THAT'S A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT I WHEN I WONDERSTRUCK MAKE URE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION I MEAN THAT SEGMENT SO WE DO HAVE SOME PARCELS THAT- WERE PURCHASED AS SAID A FULL PARCEL MEANING THAT- YOU MAY HAVE ONLY NEEDED HALF OF THE PARCEL- BUT- WE MAY OWN A- AT THE LANDOWNER MAY HAVE ASKED US TO BUY THE FULL PARCEL SO WE WOULD HAVE SOME. WHAT WE CALL NON OPERATIONAL PARCELS THAT ARE JUST OUTSIDE OUR ALIGNMENT DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF A FULL PARCEL OUTSIDE OF THAT HUNDRED NINETY MILES- THE AUTHORITY DID JACK HAS WORKED WITH A- HOMELESS CENTER IN BAKERSFIELD- THEY WERE IMPACTED BY OUR FUTURE PROJECT AND WE'RE LOOKING TO MOVE SO WE DID A PURCHASE AS SOME LANDEN KNAPP IN BAKERSFIELD- SO WE WANT IT NEGATIVELY IMPACT.

THIRRING FUNGUS ITEM ITEM BY JOINT BY OUR- CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER- ATTY NICE INJURE. IN CASE I GET STUMPED WITH ANY QUESTIONS WHICH COULD HAPPEN EASILY OKAY- AS THE STAFFING GENDA NOTES. PROPERTY FINE IS THIS SKEWS ME- YEAH THE AUTHORITY HERE IN IN THE I. T. AREAS REQUESTING A BUDGET ADJUSTMENT REDUCE THE AUTHORITIES IT CONSULTING STAFF WHICH CURRENTLY PROVIDED YOU ARE RAIL DELIVERY PARTNER CONTRACT HOW WE WOULD REDUCE CONSULTING STAFF BY THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY FIVE POINT FOR A FULL TIME CONSULTANT POSITIONS AND REPLACE THEM WITH SEVENTEEN NEW STATE STAFF POSITIONS. THIS ADJUSTMENT WILL RESULT IN A NET SAVINGS OF FOUR POINT SIX MILLION PER YEAR AS STATE STAFF WILL BE LESS EXPENSIVE AND CONSULTANTS. AS THE STAFF ADJOURNMENT NOTES BY THIS ACTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA STATE PONDER REPORT. THAT FOUND THE AUTHORITIES RELIANCE ON CONTRACTORS WAS A KEY RISK AREA TO THE ON GOING SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. SO SENSE THAT AUDIT- WE HAVE BRAD AT FORWARD A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND FINANCE LETTERS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO CONVERT TECH CONSULTANTS TO STATE STAFF WHERE APPROPRIATE. AND THAT THIS WOULD BE THE THIRD AND FINAL AT B. C. P. RELATED TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AREA. WELL AS LONG AS IT'S A NET ANNUAL OF SAVINGS. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY FINANCE PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE CONCUR WITH HIGH SPEED DRILLS PROPOSED. THANK YOU M. L. A. O. MISTER BROWN. YES HI BLAME BROWN AND GET THE L. A. O.

WORK OKAY ON ONE- SHORT QUESTION MR JANICE IS A- DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WILL BE RELYING ON IT CONSULTANTS IN THE FUTURE MOVING FORWARD. BUT THIS WOULD COMPLETE OUR TRANSITION- WITH IT CONSULTANTS IN THE AREA- THAT ARE SUPPLIED BY OUR RAIL DELIVERY PARTNER- WE WOULD TO INVASION A CONTINUATION FOR HIGHLY SPECIALIZED APPLICATIONS- WE HAVE SOME- GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND A FEW OTHER SYSTEMS WHERE- THE SKILL SET NEEDED MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AND STATE SERVICE SO WE- WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO CONTRACT OUT FOR THE- THAT TYPE OF I. T. BUT WHERE IT IS A- FUNCTION WHERE WE CAN FIND STATE STAFF. AT THAT WOULD HAVE THE SKILLS TO PERFORM THE WORK AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRANSITIONING AND- AS WAS NOTED AS WELL- WE ARE REDUCING THE NET NUMBER OF RESOURCES HERE ARE ACTION SONGS CAME IN TO HELP US STAND OUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS TO SUPPORT A- A CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. AND WE ARE NOT ONLY SHIFTING FROM STATE STAFF ASKING ME FROM CONSULTANTS TO STATE STAFF BUT WE ARE REDUCING THE NET NUMBER OF RESOURCES WE WOULD USE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT- THIS ITEM IS- HELD OPEN AND- THANK YOU. WE MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE FIFTEENTH. THIS IS THE C. H. P. RADIO CONSOLE REYES PLACEMENT PROJECT. I THINK THAT'S THE. SPEAKING HERE MISS RIGHT. YES MA'AM GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FELLOW. SO I'M COMMISSIONER MONTEREY AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY TO DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL'S BUDGET. I WON ALSO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING US PREPARE FOR THE HEARING TODAY. WE HAVE THREE OPEN BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS THAT I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT. EACH ONE IS CRUCIAL TO OUR MISSION OF PROVIDING SAFETY SERVICE AND SECURITY TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. I'LL BEGIN WITH AN OVERVIEW OF EACH B. C. P. STARTING WITH ISSUE FIFTEEN THE RADIO CONSOLE REPLACEMENT PROJECT. AND AS ALWAYS I WELCOME ANY DISCUSSION OR QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. SO OUR FIRST RBC P. WHICH IS THE RADIO CONSOLE REPLACEMENT PROJECT. THE C. H. P. REQUEST A MULTI YEAR BUDGET DOCUMENTATION FROM MOTOR VEHICLE CAL TO ADDRESS COST INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RADIO CONSOLE REPLACEMENT PROJECT. THE PROJECT WAS APPROVED IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE RADIO CONSOLE REPLACEMENT WORK IS BEING COMPLETED BY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS OR PSE. THE CURRENT B. C. P. REQUESTED DOCUMENTATION OF TWO POINT TWO SEVEN ONE MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO. N. AUGMENTATION OF TWO POINT TWO THREE MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE CHP OPERATES TWENTY FIVE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION CENTERS INTO TRAINING CENTERS. ALL OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS ARE EQUIPPED WITH RADIO CONSOLE SYSTEMS WHICH PROVIDE MISSION CRITICAL VOICE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE CHP DISPATCHERS FIELD OFFICERS AND R. L. A. AGENCY PARTNER. THE CHP IS EXISTING AB TECH RADIO CONSOLES ARE WELL BEYOND SERVICE LIFE EXPECTANCY AND ARE UNSUPPORTABLE. SOME AFTER A CONSUL SYSTEMS THEIR PURCHASE OVER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO AND WERE INSTALLED BETWEEN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND TWENTY IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. AND MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE FOR WELL OVER TWENTY YEARS. THE RADIO CONSOLE REPLACEMENT PROJECT BEGAN WITH THE CHP DEVELOPING AN EXHAUSTIVE SET OF SPECIFICATIONS IN COLLABORATION WITH YES WITH THE PSC. ENTERTAINER TALK WHAT'S THE EQUIPMENT VENDOR AWARDED THE CONTRACT AFTER A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS. FOLLOWING THE SUCCESSFUL CONSUL PILOT PROJECT C. H. P. NTSE ENDEAVOR TO ROLL OUT THE NEW INTERTIDAL SYSTEM STATEWIDE. THE NEW RADIO CONSOLES ARE INTERCONNECTED BETWEEN OUR DISPATCH CENTERS TO ALLOW CHANNEL AND WORK LOAD SHARING. THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT EXIST IN OUR ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING REPLACED. WE HAVE SEVENTEEN REMAINING COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS GET DEPRESSED ELATION. WE WILL BE INSTALLING HIS NEW SYSTEM AT OUR GOLDEN GATE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WHICH IS OUR SECOND LARGEST LOCATION IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. WE ANTICIPATE COMPLETION OF THE REMAINING INSTALLATION OF THE RADIO CONSOLES IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THE CRITICAL NEED FOR THE RADIO CONSOLE REPLACEMENT PROJECT TO CONTINUE AND RECEIVE ADEQUATE FUNDING NOT IN NOT BE UNDERSTATED. C. H. P. CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FAILURES WITH THE ANTIQUATED SYSTEM. AND WHEN THE RADIO CONSOLES FAIL CALLS FOR SERVICE RECEIVED BY THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM IN NOT BE PROPERLY COMMUNICATED TO FEEL PATROL OFFICERS BY DISPATCHERS. THIS SCENARIO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISPATCH CENTERS TO PICK UP THE EXTRA CALL WHY. ADDITIONALLY A LARGE BENEFIT TO THIS NEWER SYSTEM IS THE ENHANCE COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS. C. H. B. L. O. U. S. AND CALTRANS ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE NEW INNER TALK SYSTEMS. THE CHP HAS ADDED NUMEROUS CALTRANS CHANNELS- AS SEVERAL COMMUNICATION CENTER IS ALSO IMPROVED RADIO COMMUNICATIONS DURING EMERGENCY INCIDENTS. THIS UNIFORMITY AND EQUIPMENT STANDARDIZATION BETWEEN AGENCIES ELEVATE THE CHP'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENT SUPPORT DURING EMERGENCIES AND DURING DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. SO THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE OUR RADIO CONSOLE REPLACEMENT PROJECT BCP AND ALL STAND BY IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THE- FIRM IT'S C. OF FINANCE PLEASE THANK YOU MYSTERY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SURE KATHY MACLEOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE CAN CURVE WITH THE STAFF- RECOMMENDATION AND WE NOTE THAT THE AND THE NBA IS THE MAJOR CONCERN IN THAT. WE MONITOR THE MBA FUND CONDITION WHILE WERE. GOING THROUGH THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND THAT THERE IS AN ADEQUATE FUND BALANCE TO FUND THIS ALSO THREE. OKAY THANK YOU. OF THE L. A- PLEASE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE FIND THAT THE REQUEST IS REASONABLE GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF RADIO CONSOLES AND PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE- WE NOTE THAT THE REQUEST IS A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION SO THERE IS NOW ONGOING IMPACT TO THAT MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT. OKAY THANK YOU I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION- COMMISSIONER- WITH REGARDS TO THE- PROJECT INCREASES A- HOW MUCH OF THAT COULD BE PLANNED AND OVER YOU KNOW WHAT PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME AN UNEXPECTED COST. I'M TRYING I'M CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION AGAIN MA'AM I'M SORRY YEAH THAT'S OKAY- I'M JUST LOOKING THAT IT- IT WAS THIS- AN UNEXPECTED COST OR SOMETHING THAT WAS PLANNED OR JUST LOOKING TO THE FUTURE HOW YOU WOULD HANDLE IN THE FUTURE. POLICY WE ALL AGREE WITH YOU YOU NEED TO UPDATE WHEN YOU NEED TO UPDATE. YES UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE- SEVERAL TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAT CAME UP STATEWIDE WITH INFRASTRUCTURE SO YES- ALTHOUGH MAJORITY OF THIS PLAN THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT CAME UP. AFTER THE INITIAL- PROJECT ROLLOUT THAT DID REQUIRED SOME AUGMENTATION WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY BUT YES WE ARE. I FEEL LIKE MOVE FORWARD WE WILL BE FINE. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NO. OF OKAY I WITH THIS BILL WILL MOVE ON THAT'S TO BE HELD OPEN A COMMISSIONER YOU WANT TO MOVE ON TO. ISSUE SIXTEEN PORTABLE RADIOS REPLACING A PORTABLE RADIOS. YES MADAM CHAIR. ITSELF FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF PORTABLE RADIOS THE CHP REQUEST A PERMANENT AUGMENTATION EIGHT POINT SIX ZERO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE CAL. REPLACE PORTABLE RADIOS AND ACCESSORIES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY. ARE OUT OF WARRANTY OR UNSERVICEABLE. THE PORTABLE RADIO IS VITAL TO THE CHP'S MISSION AND IS A CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN OFFICERS IN THE FIELD DISPATCHERS AND OUR ALLY REGENCY PARK. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN C. H. BE PURCHASED EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MOTOROLA AT EXPORTABLE MODE BAND RADIO. AS WELL AS SUFFICIENT ACCESSORIES TO DEPLOY TWO UNIFORMED STAFF. THE MOTOROLA A. P. X. AND YOUR RADIO FOR US HOWEVER THE PORTABLE RADIOS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN THE FIELD SINCE EARLY TWENTY FIFTEEN AND ARE STARTING TO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR DUE TO THEIR TWENTY FOUR SEVEN USE. IN A WIDE VARIETY OF OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. ADDITIONALLY THE CHP'S EXPECTS EXISTING STOCK OF ACCESSORIES SUCH AS BATTERIES ANTENNAS IN THE PALE MICROPHONES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO FULLY SUPPORT CONTINUING SERVICE ME. APPROACH THIS PROPOSAL IS SIX TO REPLACE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY PORTABLE RADIOS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THIS FIGURE EQUATES TO A YEARLY REPLACEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE DEPARTMENT'S INITIAL INVENTORY. WITH THIS A PRO FINDING THE C. H. P. SIX SEEKS TO ESTABLISH A FIVE YEAR REPLACEMENT STRATEGY TO BE ME BOTH AS A DENTAL AN ONGOING REPLACEMENT NEEDS. AS WELL AS HAVING A READILY AVAILABLE REPLACEMENT SUPPLY. THE PROCUREMENT OF THE PORTABLE RADIOS AND ACCESSORIES LEVERAGES THE POWER OF THE WHOLESALE PURCHASING. A. Y. CONTRACTING ELIMINATES THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL EMERGENCY PURCHASES. C. H. PEOPLE PRIORITIZE THE FIRST REPLACEMENTS GOING TO THE FIELD OFFICES THAT HAVE RADIO SHORTAGES DUE TO DAMAGED AWAY HURT AND THEN THE FEEL STAFF IN PORT WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE THE PRIORITY AFTER THAT. IS CHP'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTION RECEIVES REQUESTS FOR DIGITAL RADIOS FROM THE FIELD DIVISIONS WEEKLY. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO CONTINUE WITH THE MOTOROLA ATRIX PRODUCTS WELL INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS A COST EFFICIENT RADIO SOLUTION MOTOROLA'S PRICING IS COMPARABLE TO OTHER VENDORS BUT HAVE FEATURES SUCH AS THE TRI BAND WIFI AND BLUETOOTH MEET OUR CURRENT OPERATIONAL NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY AS OF RIGHT NOW ONLY MOTOROLA PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO UPDATE RADIOS FROM THE CHP WIFI NETWORK AS OPPOSED TO COLLECTING AND UPDATING THE RADIOS MANUAL. SO THE GREATEST BENEFIT OF THE MALL ROAD IS EIGHTY X. IS INTEROPERABLE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE COUNTY AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT WE WORK ALONGSIDE OPERATE ON MODI. ON MULTIPLE RADIO BANDS MOTOROLA ATX RADIOS ASSISTED DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL ALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS. DURING THE MERGER SEES AND NATURAL DISASTERS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON THE CAP'S PORTABLE RADIO REPLACEMENT BCT. AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WAS VERY THOROUGH. OF I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS. NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ALRIGHT THAT I ITEM IS- ON HOLD AND- FROM SORRY. FINANCE I WAS SKIPPING YOU. WE JUST NOTE THE RADIOS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE MISSION OF THE CHP BEFORE THE OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU. MADAME LA- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO CONCERNS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE FIND THAT THE REQUEST IS REASONABLE GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF PORTABLE RADIOS AND COMMUNICATION WITHIN CHP AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AT THE REQUEST WILL HAVE AN ONGOING IMPACT ON THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT BAD GIVEN THAT PORTABLE RADIOS LIKE ANY OTHER EIGHTY COMMITTEES HAVE A USEFUL LIFE REGULAR REPLACEMENT SUCH EQUIPMENT SEEMS WARRANTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND WILL MOVE TO OUR LAST ITEM- COMMISSIONER THIS IS THE ISSUE SEVENTEEN THE WIRELESS IN CAR CAMERA SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS. YES MADAM CHAIR SO FOR THE FINAL ITEM. S.
