WELCOME TO I THINK THE INTRODUCTIONS ARE IN THE OPENING STATEMENTS ALL JUST GO RIGHT IN THE OPENING STATEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS A FAR CRY FROM WHERE I GREW UP IN SLAVERY COUNTING AND FAR FROM. MY FIRST POST AND CDC ARE AS A YOUNG CORRECTION OFFICER ASSIGNED TO WATCH TOWER. EVEN FURTHER FROM WHEN I WAS A CAPTAIN A LEVEL FOR FACILITY AT THE HEIGHT OF OVERCROWDING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ONE CALIFORNIA PRISON POPULATION. WAS A HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND INMATES. TODAY COME BEFORE YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE TO BE CONFIRMED AS THE FIRST LATINO SECRETARY IN THE HISTORY OF CORRECTIONS. MAYBE THE FIRST LATINA SECRETARY WHO HAS NEIGHBORS AND EVEN FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. BY LISA FOR SECRETARY TO SPEAK OPENLY ABOUT THEM AND HOW THESE CONNECTIONS SHAKE MY LEADERSHIP. AND THIS AGENCY. BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME SPECIAL PEOPLE IN SPECIAL PEOPLE IN MY LIFE. MARIA MY WIFE OF TWENTY NINE YEARS HAS BEEN MY MENTOR AND COURAGE OR AND SPIRITUAL MOTIVATOR. WITHOUT HER I COULD NOT HAVE WEATHERED THE CHALLENGES OF THIS CREATURE IN CORRECTIONS. MY CHILDREN ADRIANA AND VINCENT WHO HAVE SACRIFICED AT TIMES NOT BY HAVING THEIR FATHER PRESENT MENTALLY AND SOMETIMES PHYSICALLY. THERE NOW TO SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC IN THEIR OWN CAREERS I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS. MY MOTHER DIANA AND STEP FATHER GEORGE. GEORGE IS A RETIRED ARMY VETERAN AND RECENTLY RETIRED PUBLIC SERVANT. MY MOTHER WHO RECRUITED ME IN THE CDC ARE WHO STARTED HER CAREER IN CDC ARE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX. AND RETIRED AS A SERGEANT AT SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. SHE WAS THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF AN ONE OFFICER SHOULD BE IN CORRECTIONS. MY FATHER RALPH WHO PASSED SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHO INSPIRED ME TO BE THE BEST WORKER I COULD. WHO RAISED ME TO BE THANKFUL FOR THE SACRIFICES OF MY GRANDPARENTS. WHO LABOR IN THE FIELDS OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES IN HOPES OF A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND GRAND CHILDREN. I KNOW THAT ALL WOULD BE PROUD OF ME TODAY. LASTLY I WANT TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION TO GOVERNOR KNEW SOME. FIRST CONFIDENCE IN ME FOR POINTING ME TO THIS POSITION. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM FOR YEARS TO COME. TODAY CALIFORNIA'S INMATE POPULATION IS BELOW ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE JUNE OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND OFFENDERS LESSON SEVEN YEARS AGO. LET'S CROWDING AS LEAD TO MORE SPACE AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE CREATED MORE PROGRAM OPPORTUNITIES. FOR REHABILITATION TO BE OFFERED IN THAT SPACE THIS CHANGE HAS LEAD TO FEWER INCIDENCE. MODIFY PROGRAMS FEWER STAFF ASSAULTS AND THESE PROGRAMS OF HELP CREATE AN INMATE POPULATION THAT IS HOPEFUL. AND PLANNING FOR THEIR RELEASE. IT IS ALSO LED TO A WORKFORCE THAT IS REDEFINING THE MEANING THE PUBLIC SAFETY BEYOND INCARCERATION. I UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC SAFETY. MEANS MENTORING AND ROLE MODELING AND HAVING COURAGEOUS INTERACTIONS WITH INCARCERATED HERE SOME EXAMPLES OF OUR PROGRESS WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED. FACE TO FACE COLLEGES JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WITH A HANDFUL OF PROFESSORS TEACHING IN PRISON ONLY CORRESPONDENCE COURSES. AWARDED OVER FOUR THOUSAND YEARS OF CREDIT UNDER PROP FIFTY SEVEN INMATES HAVE EARNED THESE CREDITS BY PARTICIPATING IN EDUCATION VOCATIONAL TRADES AND SELF HELP GROUPS. WE ARE VACATED ALL OUT OF STATE BEDS AS OF JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. ALTHOUGH EACH OF THESE IS TRAGIC WE'RE ON TRACK TO HAVE FEWER HOMICIDES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FEWEST SUICIDES FEWER OVERDOSES AND FEWER ESCAPES. WE HAVE RELEASE THOUSANDS OF INMATES FROM RESTRICTED HOUSING WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED LIFE FOR INMATES AND LOW LEVEL FACILITIES MENTORING AND BEING POSITIVE ROLE MODELS TO YOUNGER INMATES. WE ARE CREATING A MORE WE CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR VICTIM OFFENDER DIALOGUES NOW BRING VICTIMS TOGETHER CORPS COMMIT WHO'VE COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE SO THEY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR RELATIVES ARE THEMSELVES. WERE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE BEHAVIOR PACE MODEL THAT PROVIDES MORE FLEXIBILITY ON HOW WE HOUSING WHERE WE HOUSE INMATES RATHER THAN THE OLD POINT SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHERE INMATES ARE HOUSED. WE HAVE OVER FOUR THOUSAND INMATES OF THE PLACE AND LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WHO HAVE RECEIVED CUSTODY LEVEL REDUCTIONS BASED ON NEW REGULATIONS. WE ARE I BELIEVE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE NATION REGARDING THE TREATMENT AND HOUSING OF TRANSGENDER INMATES. AND WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A MULTI COLLABORATIVE COMMITTEE TO EVALUATE GENDER AFFIRMING SURGERY AND REQUEST FOR HOUSING IN THAT POPULATION. ALTHOUGH I ADMIT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING DAILY TASKS THAT I HAVE A SECRETARY BEGAN EXERCISING. THE STATUTORY STATUTORY AUTHORITY MEAN BOARDING THAT RECOMMEND THAT ALLOWS ME TO RECOMMEND TO THE COURTS. THE NIGHT THAT THEY REVIEW SENTENCING DISCREPANCIES RETROACTIVELY CHANGES IN LAW AND REWARDED MAKES FOR EXCEPTIONAL CONDUCT. CCAR'S MAILED OVER ONE THOUSAND LETTERS. AND OVER AND IN OVER THREE HUNDRED CASES JUDGES HAVE RECALLED IN RE SENTENCE IN MASON REDUCE TERMS BY OVER ONE THOUSAND YEARS. ALTHOUGH THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BOGGLE MY MIND AS A YOUNG OFFICER AS A SECRETARY I RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS MOTIVATED INMATES TO DO BETTER AND STAFF TO RECOGNIZE THEIR EFFORTS AND MANY OF THOSE STAFF AND LEADERS ARE HERE WITH ME IN THIS ROOM TODAY. I WANT TO SAY THAT THESE MONIES THE THESE CHANGES THAT WE'VE DONE WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE OF WORN OUT FOR THESE DEDICATED STEP THAT ARE SITTING HERE AND WATCHING ONLINE. MY CITY SEE OUR FAMILY IS HERE AND I NEED TO LET THEM KNOW THAT PROGRESS. THIS PROGRESS THAT WE MADE IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. WE MUST LOOK FOR THEM TO GET DITIONS OF CONFINEMENT AND THE CARE OF TREATMENT OF INMATES AS INDIVIDUALS PROGRAMS IN INFRASTRUCTURE THE ATTITUDE OF THIS IS THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN JUST DOESN'T CUT ANY CORRECTIONS ANYMORE. WE CONTINUE TO BATTLE ISSUES OF ADDICTION AND GANG CULTURE. WE MUST WORK HARDER TO TREAT IN A CULTURE REHABILITATION AND HEALING. SO THAT KNOWN YOU VICTIMS ARE CREATED WE MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. TO THE WELLNESS OF STAFF. STRIVING FOR THE HEALTH AND EXCELLENCE OF A WORK FORCE. THE REWARDS ARE FROM WHICH PEOPLE OF ALL GENDERS RACE OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THESE ARE STRESSFUL JOBS AND STAFF NEED SUPPORT. I'M PROUD THAT IN A RECENT CONTRACT WE'VE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FEMALE SPECIFIC POST AND CREATED. THE FIRST EVER LABOR MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP DEDICATED FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF FEMALE STAFF. I STILL MUCH TO LEARN AS AN EXECUTIVE AND I WELCOME YOUR ADVICE. BUT AS LONG AS I'M SECRETARY OF THIS GREAT AGENCY THAT I DO LOVE I HOPE THE MY LASSEN IMPACT IS TO REFUSE TO OUR STAFF AGAIN WITH THE PURPOSE THE FELT ON THE DAY THAT THEY GRADUATED FROM THE ACADEMY OR THE DAY THEY JOINED THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS THEY GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS TO CHANGE LIVES. I HOPE THAT WHEN THE MEN AND WOMEN. THAT ARE INCARCERATED IN THIS SYSTEM ARE RELEASED THEY CAN LEAD PRODUCTIVE LIVES AND READ AND NOT RETURN TO PRISON. GOVERNOR SOME WANTS TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE CDC ARE AND I WANT TO HELP THEM. I HOPE YOU'LL GET THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SECRETARY SENATOR MONNING LET ME START WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND MR DHEAS ANA CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE AND ALSO YOUR FAMILY FOR THEIR SUPPORT IT'S DEFINITELY A- TEAM EFFORT IN TEAM SACRIFICE. IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU REFERENCE SOME OF THE SENTENCING REFORM PROP FIFTY SEVEN I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD SHARE IF YOU'VE OBSERVED ANY CHANGES IN TERMS OF INTERNAL SAFETY FOR IN MAINE STAFF IN GUARDS. BASED ON SENTENCING REFORMS THAT HAVE GIVEN. INMATES PERHAPS CAUSE FOR HOPE NANA THAT RESULTS IN BEHAVIOR I HAVE SEEN GIANT SENATOR COULD YOU SHARE SOME OF YOUR OF THE CHANGES THAT I HAVE SEEN IS THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND PUT INTO PLACE BY CORRECTIONS THROUGH THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS COUPLED WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT OF PEOPLE COME IN AND FACILITATE PROGRAMS AND INMATES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THEIR TRUE MEANINGFUL PROGRAMS ARE IN MAYES COME IN. THEY THE STAFF AND THE VOLUNTEERS A FACILITATOR THEY RECEIVE CURRICULUM THAT THE OTHERWISE WOULDN'T RECEIVED IN THE COMMUNITY OR OTHERWISE IN YEARS PAST THESE INMATES EARN CREDITS FOR THEM THE MONITORED AND I USE THE TERM EARNED WE DON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAMS IN PRISONS LIKE NO OTHER WITH ESTABLISH DOG PROGRAMS ANTI GANG PROGRAMS BEHAVIOR BASED ENGINE NOT TO WERE IN MAYES CAN THINK DIFFERENTLY. PROGRAMS OR WE CAN EMBRACE THEIR CULTURE THEIR BACKGROUNDS WE HAVE SEEN CHANGES IN HOUSE STAFF INTERACT WITH THE INMATES BECAUSE THEY SEE IN MAKES HIS YEAR THERE WAS A DAY WHEN INMATES WOULD JUST SIT ON THE DATA SAID ON THE DAY ROOM FLOOR JUST READ CREATE ON THE ART IN MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO GOING TO PROGRAM WHAT THAT DOES IS ESTABLISHES A MORE HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT AS I TO THE PRISONS I WITNESSED IT MYSELF. THANK YOU IN YOU REFERENCED I THINK SOME OF THE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRAINING PROGRAMS HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE UTILIZATION OF OUTSIDE NONPROFITS VOLUNTEERS SIN HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP FOR THOUGHTS REGARDING THE ROLE OF. SOME OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS. INTERACTING WITH INMATES IN TERMS OF EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION. I REALLY VALUE OUR PARTNERS OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE VOLUNTEERS THAT COME IN I THINK ONE OF THE MOST. ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THINGS THAT WOULD OTHER THAN AGENCIES WELCOME THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED TO COME BACK AND FACILITATE SOME OF THESE COURSES TO THE INMATE POPULATION. AND I THINK THIS I KNOW WHAT THIS DOES IS BRINGS CREDIBLE MESSENGERS TO THE INMATES BUT THEY CAN SPEAK OF THE NEW HOPE THAT IS OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS AND THAT THE PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE IN. THAT IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING SO THAT IN ITSELF TO HAVE FORMALLY INCARCERATED COMING BACK IN AND SPEAKING POSITIVE YOU INTO THESE LIVES BUT THEN ALSO THE STAFF THAT WITNESS SOME OF THE INMATES THE FORMALLY CULTURE TO THE COME BACK. THEY MAY HAVE THEY MAY HAVE OVERSEEING THEM MAYBE SIX MONTHS AGO A YEAR AGO AND IT IS GOOD TO SEE THE FRUITS OF THAT WORK SO FOR ME THAT IS THE THAT'S A CULTURE SHIFT INSIDE THE INSTITUTIONS. I WELCOME MORE WE DO HAVE CHALLENGES A SOME MORE RURAL AREAS WE'RE MAKING HEADWAY OUT THERE. THANK YOU IN. WHEN WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK MOM. I RAISED AN ONGOING CONCERN I KNOW IT'S A SHARED CONCERN OF. CONTRABAND COMING INTO THE PRISONS FROM. DRUGS WEAPONS CELL PHONES THAT CAN BE WEAPONIZED IN A SENSE. IN THERE'S VERY HIGH SECURITY AND SCRUTINY OF FAMILY MEMBERS VISITING DURING VISITING HOURS BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN FOUND THAT SOME OF THE HOLES IN THAT SECURITY ARE WITH STAFF EMPLOYEES EVEN GUARDS BRINGING IN CONTRABAND. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO. THAT. THAT SUSCEPTIBILITY IN OUR SYSTEM THAT AFFECTS THE SAFETY OF INMATES GUARDS AND STAFF I THINK ONE ONE THING THAT WE ALREADY HAVE DONE WE HAVE A TWO YEAR PILOT THAT ONE INSTITUTION AT THE- CALIFORNIA SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY IN CORCORAN TO WHERE. WE HAVE EVERY STAFF MEMBER COMING IN IS SEARCH SIMILAR TO WHAT THE WAY YOU'D BE SEARCHED IN AN AIRPORT WE HAVE INCREASED BAGGAGE CAN LIVE INCREASE STAFF TO WERE AND STAFFING TO WERE STE STAFF CAN BE SEARCH MORE CLOSELY. WE NEED TO MOVE FURTHER ALONG THOSE ALONG THAT TRACK BUT I NEED TO HAVE THE DATA AT THIS ONE PILOT TO MAKE SURE WE MOVE FORWARD. IN AN EFFICIENT AND A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY. I THINK THAT WAS A DAY IN IN MY OWN TEN YEAR I WOULDN'T I WOULD HAVE CHALLENGE ANYONE THAT AND STAFF ON INVOLVED IN THIS BUT- UNFORTUNATELY I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE AND HAVE SEEN THE STAFF TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY STAFF MEMBER THAT WOULD AGREE THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING I BELIEVE THE STAFF TO DO THIS. FOR THE RIGHT REASONS TO CHANGE LIVES AND HAVE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT THEY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO. ROOT OUT STAFF WHO ARE WHO ARE ENGAGING IN THIS ACTIVITY. WHEN WAS THE PILOT AT CORCORAN BE COMPLETED WHEN YOU HAVE DATA TO LEARN I SHOULD HAVE DATA BY NOVEMBER OF TWENTY. IN WHAT'S THE PROSPECT FOR EXTENDING. THOSE PROTOCOLS AT CORCORAN TO ALL MMHM SECURITY FACILITIES AND IS THERE ANY RESISTANCE FROM STAFF OR BARGAINING UNITS TO INSTITUTE STRICTER FROM ENTRY AND EXIT CRITERIA I THINK THE RESPONSIBLE THING FOR ME TO DO IS TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHEN IT WHEN WE GET FINISHED WITH THAT PILOT AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS BASED OFF THAT DATA. I DON'T WANT TO ENTER INTO ANYTHING GREATER THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A- PUT A DENT IN THIS BUDGET OR ASK FOR RESOURCES THAT I CAN'T WITH CONFIDENCE SAY THAT THIS IS THE WAY TO GO MAYBE I CAN USE PIECES. OF THIS PILOT BUT NOT THE WHOLE THING. I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY IN THE DEPARTMENTS WERE CLOSELY WITH LABOR. WITH THE BARGAINING UNITS AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ON BOARD WITH HAVING SAFE INSTITUTIONS. THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH. JUST WITH THE CONCEPT OF SEARCHING THE THOMAS OF THE DO WE TRUST AFTER NOT. AND IT DIDN'T AND I THINK THE CASE IS. WE ARE WANTING SAY FACILITY IS NOT A MATTER OF TRUST IT'S ABOUT TO MATTER OF SAFETY THAT'S ABOUT COMMUNICATING TO OUR LABOR PARTNERS ON WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. THANK YOU IN. AGAIN YOU'VE CITED CORCORAN IS A PILOT PROGRAM ARE THERE ON GOING SECURITY PROTOCOLS THAT THE OTHER PRISONS DESIGNED TO. INTERCEPT CONTRABAND WHATEVER VIA WHATEVER ROUTE IT MIGHT BE ENTERING WE HAVE A WE HAVE A CANINE PROGRAM THAT IS A STATE WIDE PROGRAM STATEWIDE EFFORT AND THAT DOES WE HAVE DESIGNATED STAFF ON A STATEWIDE BASIS THAT GOAL FROM PRISON TO PRISON. UTILIZED DOGS TO SEARCH OUT CELL PHONES TO SEARCH OUT CONTRABAND THE DEPARTMENT HAS A POLICY AND IT'S ON THAT WE DO RANDOM SEARCHES OF STAFF ON A HOLISTIC LEVEL WE MAY JUST SLOW DOWN THE SEARCH STAFF IN A MORE. IN A SLOWER WAY IN A MORE DETAILED WAY FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF OUR PROTOCOLS I THINK ANYTHING WE VENTURE INTO THE HOUSE TO BE DATA DRIVEN AND HAS TO BE A BEST PRACTICE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE INTEREST TO SOMETHING THAT FOUR YEARS DOWN THE ROAD SAY IT DIDN'T GET DIDN'T GET THE RESULTS YOU WANT BUT WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY THANK. BEEN UNDER CURRENT PROTOCOLS. IS IT. IF YOU DETERMINE THAT A STAFF MEMBER IS SMUGGLING CONTRABAND IS THAT GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION YES IT IS IT AUTOMATIC TERMINATION THEY HAVE TO PROCESS LIKE A AN EMPLOYEE THEY HAVE AN INVESTIGATORY PROCESS AND WE PUT WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR RIGHTS AVAILABLE TO THEM WITH REPRESENTATION. BUT IN THE END BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PREVENT STAFF AND TO TOUR STAFFER PARTICIPATE IN THIS IN THE END ANY CONTRABAND THAT COMES IN IS DANGEROUS. THE IN MY POPULATION THERE IS A HIGH VALUE DOLLAR TO THESE ITEMS AND IT DISRUPTS ARE REHABILITATED PROCESSES IN A REALIZE YOU MAY NOT HAVE AT YOUR FINGER TIPS TODAY BUT COULD YOU GET US. ANY DATA THAT WOULD REFLECT SOME DISCIPLINE IN ORDER MANY NATIONS OF STAFF RELATED TO CONTRABAND OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS YES I CAN APPRECIATE. THANK YOU AND THEN. MY FINAL QUESTION I KNOW THERE'S. THE INQUIRY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF LITIGATION BUT IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AND I DON'T INTEND TO GO INTO AREAS OF ACTIVE LITIGATION WITH SPECIFICS. IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU DID TALK ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT. TO ADVANCING IN PROTECTING DIVERSITY AND GENDER EQUITY IN RECRUITMENT IN RETENTION IN AND PROMOTION COULD YOU SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE WHAT SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE IN IN YOUR BROADER COMMITMENT MOVING FORWARD AND TO GUARANTEE. THAT EQUITY AND LEGAL PROTECTIONS IN RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND PROMOTION. SO THIS ISSUE IS OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES AND I TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID AS A SECRETARY WHEN PRESENTED WITH A PRESENTATION FROM A GROUP CALLED THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE ON RACE AND EQUITY IS PRESENTED TO ME AND THAT WAS. HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO ALL STATE AGENCIES TO SEE WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE AND WHAT THAT GROUP IS TEN IS SO WE CAN EXAMINE INTERNALLY WITH OUR DATA ON A HIRING PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO PLACE IN BY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HIGHER WRITTEN. A STE LOOKS LIKE A STAFF THAT COVERS A WHOLE SPAN OF OUR COMMUNITIES WE WANT A DIVERSE COMMUNITY WE WANT AND GENDER A GENDER. A STEP THAT'S LOOKED BEYOND GENDER BECAUSE THE QUALITIES AND SKILLS THAT COME TO US ARE ARE DIVERSE JUST LIKE OURS. IN MY POPULATION IS DIVERSE THEY COME FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. AND I WANT A WORKFORCE THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT DIVERSE WORKFORCE. SO I TOOK THAT ON MY SPONSORED THAT GROUP THE DEPARTMENT NGUYEN WHOLEHEARTEDLY. SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN TWO YEARS INTO THAT GROUP. I SHIP THAT THAT GROUP UNDER OUR OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS WILL OVERSEE IT. THE GROUP WILL BE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS WILL THEN FOR THEM UP. TO MYSELF AND OUR HR SO WE CAN MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES. ONE THING THAT I I'M WELL AWARE OF AS A TOURING THE INSTITUTIONS. AND NOT HAVING TO HAVING GROWN UP IN THIS BUSINESS I AM LOOKING FOR A WORK FORCE EXECUTIVES LEADERS SUPERVISORS AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN. A ROOM THAT JUST DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ME I'M LOOKING FOR A ROOM AND LEADERS THAT LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WITHIN THAT DIVERSITY WE HAVE IDEAS WE HAVE COURAGE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WILL SPEAK OUT OPENLY AND THINK DIFFERENTLY. ONE THING THAT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN WITH THIS GROUP IS NOT A PRESENTATION WAS GIVEN TO WARDENS. AND IT WAS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION WITH THESE WARDENS THAT THEY HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE FACING THE SOME OF THE INITIAL DATA IS. WE NEED TO DO BETTER. ON WHO WI HIGHER. AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE VALUE AND THE TAP THE HIGHER. NOT JUST BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE EVERY DAY WE HAVE TO BRING IN. A DIVERSITY OF INDIVIDUAL SO WE CAN HAVE A GOOD GROUP. IT IS ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A DIVERSE WORKGROUP I AM. AS I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT MY MOTHER RECRUITED ME INTO CDC ARE. AND I'M WELL AWARE OF MY MOTHER'S TRIALS AS YOU NOTED SHE RETIRED AS ST QUITTING BUT- WE ARE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SHE HAD TO GET HER TO SAY QUITTING BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I'M SURE SHE WOULD RATHER GUN HIRED IN THE CENTRAL SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BUT SHOULD TAKE ABORTIONS AND QUICK. I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF IT BUT I KNOW IT WAS A CHALLENGE AND I KNOW. IF SOME OF THESE MEASURES COULD'VE BEEN A PLACE MAYBE MONICA STATE HOMES THAT A COME UP TO SAN QUENTIN. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTIONS AND- WE JUST ASK MAYBE IS MY FINAL QUESTION. YOUR COMMITMENT IF CONFIRMED. TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE. IN WORKING TO ACHIEVE GOALS THAT I THINK BY YOUR OWN STATEMENT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ACHIEVED IN. THE REALM OF. RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND PROMOTION. YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT SENATOR THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEMP. THANK YOU I'M GONNA SKIP OVER YOU SENATOR BATES AND SHE JUST GOT HERE AND I WILL COME BACK TO YOU AND I WILL GO TO OUR VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. APPRECIATED OUR OUR OUR OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY CONGRATULATIONS ON THE APPOINTMENT THAT REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU TOOK A LOT OF TIME TO TALK ABOUT REHABILITATION. WE NEED TO DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HIT THE PEOPLE ON END UP THERE BUT WE ALSO NEEDED A QUICK THESE PEOPLE SO THEY CAN BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WHEN THEY GET OUT. SO HAVING TO DO WITH THAT IN IN JANUARY THIS YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR CAME OUT WITH A REPORT IT WAS KIND OF CRITICAL. OF THE OVERSIGHT. THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN DOING REGARDING REHABILITATION SO I KNOW IF YOU YOU READ THAT. DID YOU AGREE WITH THAT OF OTHERS ARE YOU TAKEN STEPS TO MAYBE. ADDRESS SOME OF THE INADEQUACIES THAT WERE LISTED. I HAVE WRITTEN I AGREE WITH PORTIONS OF THE REPORT. I DO WELCOME ANY AND ALL CRITICISM THE REPORTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED THEM. WE HAVE TO SEE THINGS ONLY BECAUSE IN THE END YOU KNOW WE WERE HERE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. THE PEACE OF THE REPORT THAT I DIDN'T AGREE WITH I THINK THAT WITH THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE REPORT WAS A WORK COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IS ALMOST NEARLY 70% OF THAT REPORT. BUT IT ALSO CHALLENGE US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE REST OF OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. SO FOR AS AN AGENCY IT IS OUR GOAL NUMBER ONE TO REHABILITATE THE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT ARE GOT PUT IN THE CDC AREN'T TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. UNFORTUNATELY THE RECESSION CAME UPON. SHORTLY AFTER WAS DECIMATED A REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WE BUILT UP. SINCE THEN AND- THAT'S REFLECT A LITTLE BIT IN THAT REPORT. I DO BELIEVE THAT REHABILITATION IS OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. AND MORE POORLY TO HAVE THE MOST VALUABLE. TOOL OUT THERE'S OUR OUR STAFF MEMBERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE ROLE. AND WHAT ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN REHABILITATION. SO I THINK THE FUNDING THAT WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING. AND WE HAVE RECEIVED I THINK IT IS GOING INTO. IS BEING INVESTED PROPERLY JUST AN EDUCATION PIECE TWO THOUSAND IN NINETEEN ALONG WE HAD OVER THREE THOUSAND GED OR HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCIES EARNED A TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WE HAVE THIRTY THIRTY FOR FACE TO FACE COLLEGES. THE WATER SYSTEM LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER. AND JUST IN THIS YEAR ALONE WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED A. A.'S EARNED JUST. WITH OUR COLLEGE PIECE FIVE BACHELOR'S DEGREES AND THEN TO POST GRADUATE DEGREES. I THINK EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO ANYBODY SUCCESS IF YOU CAN LEARN SELF ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF. YOU WILL HAVE LESS ISSUES. RETURN INDIVIDUALS FOR PAROLE TO THE VOCATIONAL SIDE I BELIEVE AND I KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE PROGRAMS ON THE VOCATIONAL SIDE THAT ARE PREPARING INMATES. IN THE MOST CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES AND WE ARE MEETING INDUSTRY STANDARDS IN THE CERTIFICATIONS THAT THEY DO RECEIVE. THE NATIONAL RECOGNIZED ANYWHERE FROM SOLAR SOLAR INSTALLATION ELECTRONICS AND WIRING IN AN INSTALLATION TO AUTO REPAIR WE WE'RE NO LONGER INTO THE BUSINESS OF FIXING CARBURETORS WEIRD TRAINING IN MAY SADDAM. RIPPER HYBRID VEHICLES. WE RECENTLY CUT A RIBBON ON A PROGRAM AT SOLEDAD STATE PRISON ON THE BUILDING OF MICRO HOMES. FOR YEARS OF TERROR IN MADE CONSTRUCTION AND HOW TO BUILD STRUCTURES PLUM THEM YEAH. INSTALL ELECTRICITY BUT NOW IT'S GOING TO BE MORE MEANINGFUL AT THAT INSTITUTION THEY CAN BILL MICRO HOMES OF THE USE IN THE COMMUNITY. SO WITHIN CONSTRUCTION ALL OF THESE INDUSTRIES THAT I MENTIONED THEY ARE. FRIENDLY TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND WE HAVE SEEN SUCCESS I'M EXCITED TO SAY THAT THIS MORNING. AN AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED ON A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT THAT SO WE CAN TRACK OUR SUCCESSES NOT ONLY IN EDUCATION. BUT THE WORK FORCE AND H. R. SO OUR PAROLEES WHEN THEY DO INTO THE WORK FORCE OR EDUCATION WE TRACKED THEIR SUCCESS WITH SECOND BETTER. ASSIST US AS AN AGENCY. TO FIND TO WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE RETAIL SIDE. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND HONESTLY I THOUGHT FEDERAL CENTER MONEY DID A FABULOUS JOB SO HE TOOK ALL MY QUESTIONS I WAS THE ONLY ONE I HAD. SO BUT AGAIN AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT THANK YOU. I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST MET NEXT TIME MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. HE TOOK A NUMBER OF MINE TOO BUT I FIGURE BY THE TIME IT GETS TO ME YOU'VE ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU A MAN PRO TEM. A MISTER SECRETARY CONGRATULATIONS SIR YOUR RESUME. AND BACKGROUNDER QUITE IMPRESSIVEAND FRANKLY MY ADMITTEDLY. CURSORY REVIEW I GUESS YOU WOULD SAVE YOU PROGRAMS YOU'VE LAUNCHED A KNOWS YOU PLAN TO LAUNCH. CERTAINLY THOSE ALSO APPEAR TO BE QUITE IMPRESSIVE. I HAVE ACTUALLY NO. FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME UNFORTUNATELY DURING THE. PRE HEARING INTERVIEW PROCESS I AS FOR HIS QUESTIONS REGARDING THE DEPARTMENTS AND INTERNAL COMPLAINT AN INVESTIGATION PROCESS WHICH YOU YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO ANSWER AT LEAST AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I DO THINK AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IN A- ELECTED SENATOR IN THIS BODY I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS IN. THIS COMMITTEE'S ROLE IN THAT PROCESS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY ALL. ALL THE ALL WHO WERE INVOLVED AND FOR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO FULLY EXPLORE. IANY AND ALL ISSUES THAT ARE PRESENTED BY AN APPOINTMENT AN ATTEMPT TO GET. ANSWERS TO THOSE ISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT ARISE. FIVE SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE WE CERTAINLY. ATTEMPT TO DO SO BUT- HAVING SAID THAT AND NOT WITHSTANDING THAT ASSUMING THERE IS A MOTION I WILL BE VOTING. TO MOVE YOUR NOMINATION TO THE SENATE FOR A TO PERMIT FURTHER DISCUSSION. AND A VOTE OF BY MY COLLEAGUE SO AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS. I LOOK FORWARD TO READING MORE ABOUT YOUR INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS IN YOUR SUCCESSES. AT THE DEPARTMENT IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU CENTER LIKE ABOUT BRIDGE. THANK YOU SENATOR OFF. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR AND OF WELCOME MISTER DIAZ WE HAD A NICE DISCUSSION I THINK OF MY COLLEAGUES OF COVERED A COUPLE OF THE ISSUES IN PARTICULAR I THINK AS A FORMER SOCIAL WORKER WE SHARED OF OUR MUTUAL OF CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNS ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE BACK YOU KNOW TO PRODUCTIVE PART OF SOCIETY AND CERTAINLY THAT YOU ARE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON THAT I THINK A IN MY CONVERSATION WITH YOU I DID MENTION THAT ARE SENATOR SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME. THE LATTER PART OF LAST YEAR IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS YOU'RE LOOKING AT SEXUAL HARASSMENT ISSUES AND ENSURING THAT WE HAD A PROCESS THAT TO A FAIRLY FOR BOTH ON BOTH SIDES OF AN ISSUE THE ACCUSED IN THE ACCUSER WERE DEALT WITH FAIRLY NOW THE THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH CERTAINLY AND I THINK MY QUESTION WAS KLAY WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ENSURE THAT CHILD TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. COMPLAINTS ARE DEALT WITH AND WHAT IS THAT PROCESS AND WITH GENDER DISCRIMINATION WHICH IS KIND OF A CADA. SO IF YOU WILL OF THE SAME ISSUE AREA. WOULD. SHARE WITH US SOME OF THE THINGS SHE SHARED WITH ME. OUR HOW YOU'RE ADDRESSING THAT IN ENSURING THAT OUT TO YOU STAFF AND YOU HAVE. YOUR YOUR EMPLOYEES WHICH ARE HUGE. ARE ALL RIGHT ON THE RIGHT PAGE ON HOW WE DEAL WITH THOSE THINGS IN OUR- IN OUR LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY IN OUR STATE AGENCIES. SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND WE DO HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE. THAT IS A PROCESS THAT. THERE'S SEVERAL WAYS THAT AN EMPLOYEE CAN FILE A COMPLAINT OR EXPRESS A CONCERN ABOUT AN ISSUE. THE WE HAVE INTERNAL FILING PROCESSES AND THAT'S DEL THROUGH OUR LOCAL INTERVENTION PROCESS AT THE FACILITY LEVEL AND THE FIELD LEVEL. THE EMPLOYEE CAN ALSO GO TO THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS OPERATIONS IN OUR HEADQUARTERS LEVEL OR THEY CAN ALSO FILED FOR THROUGH INTERNAL EXTERNAL AGENCIES THROUGH DFG H. R. E. E. O. C. OF THE DEPARTMENT DOES TRAIN OUR STAFF ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THAT'S PART OF OUR ANNUAL BLOCK TRAINING ON HOW EMPLOYEES ARE TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES WITH AND ALSO HOW SUPERVISORS ARE TO. RECEIVE THESE COMPLAINTS. ONCE A COMPLAINT IS RECEIVED BY A SUPERVISOR THE IMPORT OF THE SUPERVISOR HAS THE OBLIGATION AND THEY HAVE THE DUTY. TO REPORT THIS TO THE OEO COORDINATOR OF THE OF THE FEEL THAT I I'M STAYING AWAY FROM INSTITUTION BECAUSE JUST SAYS. THE BIG SPENCER CORRECTIONS TO THEIR EAGLE COORDINATOR. AND FROM THERE THE IO COORDINATOR THEN RECEIVES A COMPLAINT. WE HAVE THE REASON WE HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO THE COMPLAIN WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS THE GOAL OF THIS PROCESS NUMBER ONE IS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT THE AT THE LOWEST LEVEL POSSIBLE SO WE CAN GET IMMEDIATE RESULTS WE CAN HAVE A HEALTHY. AND THEN DISCRIMINATION FREE WORK ENVIRONMENT WE WANT TO GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO IF SOMEONE WHO IS DOING THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF POLICY WE NEED R. E. O. CORNISH TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE TO TAKE REMEDIES TO SEPARATE THE- THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WHO'S OFFENDING. TO POSSIBLY EVEN PUT HIM ON HBO BUT IN THE END THEY HAVE THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS ALSO SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BUT THEN IF WE THROUGH THAT PROCESS FIND THAT THERE ARE ISSUES THAT IS ELEVATED UP AND IT GOES TO YOUR COORDINATORS. AND THROUGH THAT THEY DO FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT IN COURT RECEIVE ALL INFORMATION AND WITH THAT PROCESS AND IS GIVEN OVER TO HER IN THE FORTIES TO SEE WHAT DIRECTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO WE GO INTO A MORE FORMAL INTERNAL AFFAIRS INQUIRY. AND THOSE IN CORY'S CAN LEAD FOR EVERYTHING FROM TERMINATION TO FINDING THAT THERE ARE NO THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING IN THE CASE AND PAINTING AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. SO THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THE NEW DISCRIMINATION IN SYSTEM THAT IS A STATE WHERE ALL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT AS CHALLENGES TO THE GRAVITY AND THE LARGESS THE STATE OF THE. I'M GONNA CORRECTION THE NOW WE THE MINUTE BUT I HAVE MY TEAM. DEDICATED ON THAT AND I'VE HAD MEETINGS WITH THEM THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS TODAY SURE ME. AND DESCRIBE TO ME HOW THIS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ONE OF THE MOST. I THINK. THINGS WERE GOING TO DO ONCE WE IMPLEMENT THIS SYSTEM. IS WE WILL BE REMOVING. THE E. E. O. COORDINATOR WHO DOES RECEIVE THE COMPLAINTS FROM THE COUNSELORS. OUTSIDE OF THE FEEL THEY WILL BE REGIONAL ALLIES IT'LL BE AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY TO REVIEW WHAT IS RECEIVED. AND THEY WILL TAKE A LOOK. IT WILL NO LONGER JUST BE WITHIN THE FIELD FOR HIGHER THAN THIRTY. RECEIVES IT MAKES AN ASSESSMENT IT WILL NOW BE WITH THE COORDINATOR WHO THEN REPORTS OR OFF THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND HEAD QUARTERS. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. AND IN THE END WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT THE DATA THAT WE RECEIVE. LOOK AT THOSE ANY TRENDS THESE ARE EARLY DECATUR SO WE CAN MAKE TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION IF WE SEE AN AREA. A DIVISION IN THIS AGENCY IS NOT DOING WELL BUT THE MORE POORLY AS A SECRETARY I SPEAK OUT DIRECTLY. I SPEAK OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS. AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING ONLINE RIGHT NOW ON NO BUT. THIS IS THE HARDEST PART FOR THE AGENCY. AND THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT. THE PRIEST. THAT ANSWER UP. IN CHILE YOU ON YOUR ON NOMINATION ON MY PROBABLY WILL KIND OF. FIVE FIRST HERE ON TIME VERY INTERESTED EXCITED ABOUT YOU KNOW SEEING THE TRACKING AS YOU IMPLEMENT THE PLAN JUST LIKE WE HAVE DONE HERE ARE WITH OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'RE SABOTAGING TRUST AMONG YOUR EMPLOYEES AND ALSO WITH THE PUBLIC WHICH IS WHERE YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL WHILE WE'RE THEIR SERVANTS SO THANK YOU ARE A GREAT RESUME AND YOU'RE NOT YOU WILL BE BEFORE THE SENATE FLOOR YES I MIGHT BE CHATTING WITH YOU BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. LOOK FOR THE COVER SAKE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK LET'S SEE MY COLLEAGUES OF COVERED ALMOST EVERY TOPIC. THAT WE I KNOW HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME I WANT TO JUST ADD ONE MORE QUESTION RELATED TO THE TRANS GENDER INMATES AND STAFF I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTING ON THE STATUS OF THE WORKING GROUP ON TRANSGENDER INMATES. I GUESSI WOULD ASK I WANT TO PUT STAFF IN THAT CATEGORY TOO IF THEY'RE TRANS GENDER STAFF MEMBER. I GENDER NON CONFORMING HI WE LIVE IN A FLUID WORLD. AND WE HAVE TO ADJUST OUR ALL OF OUR PERSONNEL IN NATURE POLICIES MUST ADJUST WITH THAT AS WELL I AM INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT EXPERTS OR- MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT. RANGE GENDER GENDER NON CONFORMING ARE YOU SEEKING TO BE PART OF THAT. EITHER THE EITHER THE WORKING GROUP OR TO PRESENT TO THE WORKING GROUP HAS THAT HAPPENED ALREADY OR THEIR PLANS TO THE THERE ARE THERE ARE PEOPLE WE HAVE SOUGHT OUT NOTHING MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THE INMATE POPULATION SPEAKING TO THEM WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE WHAT THE INPUT IS ON THE POLICY THAT WE'RE GONNA STAB WISH. BUT I THINK EARLIER ON E HAD WE THOUGHT OUT PEOPLE TO COME IN AND WE HAVE A TRANS GENDER MALE BUT ADRIN LAWYER WHO CAME IN FROM NEW MEXICO TO GIVE TRAINING. ON. ON WHAT THE POLICY SHOULD LOOK LIKE HOUSE STAFF ARE TO TREAT AN **** REALLY TOUGH QUESTIONS. HE CAME AND PROVIDED TRAINING TO MY EXECUTIVE TEAM HERE IN HEADQUARTERS HE PROVIDED TRAINING TO OUR- TO OUR WARDENS. AND IT WAS REAL IT REALLY OPENED UP A LOT OF EYES. AND I THINK THROUGH THAT TRAINING WERE ABLE TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND ENCOURAGE QUESTIONS. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING. THAT THIS. THE SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION REALLY DESERVES HONOR DIGNITY RESPECT AND TO BE TREATED AS ANYONE ELSE. AND THE TO DISPEL ANY CONCERNS THAT MAY BE OUT THERE. AND I THINK AT TIMES WERE JUST AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS SO FOR ME THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS TO COME IN. AND TALK TO US. IN THE WORK GROUP THE TRANSGENDER WORKGROUP I ATTENDED A PIECE OF THAT WORK GROUP LAST WEEK WE DID HAVE. SOME PARTNERS IT DID COME IN. I COULD GET YOU THE NAMES OF THOSE I KNOW THERE AT THE TABLE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET TO ME THAT BUT I DEFINITELY WILL GET YOU THE NAMES OF THOSE. INDIVIDUALS JUST THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY HAD ON SOME OF THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WERE VERY FRUITFUL. AND BRINGING THINGS UP THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF A CORRECTIONS AND A GOVERNMENTAL MINDSET THAT WE NEEDED TO BE COMPETENT AT THESE ISSUES AND IF THEY WEREN'T THERE. WE WILL SKIP OVER. WE MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND WE MAY HAVE A- IN A ONCE AGAIN MARGINALIZE. A GROUP EVEN MORE BECAUSE WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU I'M JUST MAKE A FEW COMMENTS AND THEN GO TO THE SPEAKERS AS SUPPORT YOU KNOW I BY THE WAY I WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS ALWAYS TO COME IN AND MEET WITH ME REGARDLESS OF WHEN I WAS A SENATOR WHEN YOU WERE A AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY SO BEFORE I WAS PRO TEM I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO COME IN AND WORK WITH ME AS A MEMBER ON ISSUES I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT LEGISLATION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU FIRSTLY. WE OF. AS A RESPONSE TO AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OTHER SENATORS. YEAH WE REPRESENT THEM AND- I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES BUT I KNOW ON THE- DEMOCRATIC SIDE WE HAVE. A POLICY RETREATS AND AS DO YOU AND- THE WORK DONE AT CDC ARE IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO MY COLLEAGUES. AT WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY YOU SEE WE HAVE MANY MORE ISSUES ARE. ARE RELATED TO MAYBE THE WORK THAT YOU DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF INMATES ARE ALL ACROSS THE STATE A LOT OF. FACILITIES AND SO IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THEM. AND THE GOVERNOR OF COURSE IS INDICATED THAT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT AND I COULD NOT AGREE MORE. THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF REHABILITATION AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. OUR SUCCESS IS BASED ON YOUR SUCCESS YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK AND SO FOR US TO TAKE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH THESE THINGS I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND GIVEN YOUR HISTORY SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THERE'S SO MANY ISSUES FACILITIES NEEDS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ONCE A YEAR OR SO AGO I THINK WE'VE GOT A AND I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PUTTING SOME RESOURCES TOWARD SAID. WE ARE NEVER GOING TO REHABILITATE PEOPLE IF WE PUT THEM IN FACILITIES THAT DON'T REFLECT OUR DESIRE. TO REHABILITATE PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THEY THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT THE MAN WHEN THERE IS AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE FACILITIES ISSUES THE TRAINING NEEDS. ARE CRITICAL. PART OF THE PLAN. I APPRECIATE YOUR APPROACH WE CAN HAVE IDEALS AND GOALS BUT IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE IT REAL I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE TALKING ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'VE HAD TO DO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WE HAD TO LOOK OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR. AND SEE THAT WE HAVE MAJOR CULTURAL. SCHIFF SAID NEEDS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON AND IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL BUT I THINK YOU HAVE A MUCH BIGGER TASK THAN WE DO. BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE. INMATES ARE WHO ARE NOT EXACTLY THERE I THROUGH THEIR VOLUNTEERISM. HI AND YOU'VE GOT STAFF SO. I DO THINK THAT'S WHY WE TAKE THIS SO SERIOUSLY. AND I WILL JUST LEAVE IT THERE WE HAVE PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SPEAK BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S. APPOINTMENTS I WILL SAY THIS TO THE PUBLIC WE HAVE IN ADDITION TO THE PEOPLE IN HERE WE HAVE FORTY FIVE OTHER PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO ARE HERE IN SUPPORT.

IN FAIRNESS YOU HAD REQUESTED FOR MINUTES MOST OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE COME IN IN A MINUTE SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET TWO MINUTES AS WE TYPICALLY ALLOW EVERYONE I SHORTENED OTHERS. I AM ABLE FOLLOW THAT RULE SOME PEOPLE DID NOT BUT WE WERE UNDER. A MINUTE FOR MOST PEOPLE I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE SO THAT YOU'RE NOT GIVING EACH OF THEM TO ICING COVER. I WILL BE LESS THAN THE TOTAL OF SIX MINUTES BY FAR I WILL I WILL AGREE WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THANK YOU AND I DON'T FORGET TO GIVE ME YOUR NAME. I WILL. SO MY NAME IS LESLIE LEVY I'VE BEEN A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AT THE MOMENT I REPRESENT TWO VERY COURAGEOUS WOMEN OF TAKEN THE STEP OF CHALLENGING. THE SYSTEMIC GENDER. DISCRIMINATION IN CD C. R. WHICH THEY HAVE ENCOUNTERED OVER TWENTY FIVE YEAR HISTORY IS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. THIS TESTIMONY IS NOT ABOUT THAT LAWSUIT. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN IN C. D. C. R. WHO WILL NOT PUBLICLY TESTIFY. AT BECAUSE OF THEIR REALISTIC FEAR OF RETALIATION AND IF YOU NOTICED OUT OF THE SIXTY OR SO PEOPLE WHO JUST TESTIFIED. THERE WERE ONLY THREE WOMEN PEACE OFFICERS WHO STEP FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE FEAR THE WOMEN HAVE IN THE SYSTEM. YOU HAVE MY COVER LETTER YOU HAVE THE LETTER WRITTEN BY SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE PARKER I'M NOT GOING TO GO OVER THAT IN ANY DETAIL. WHAT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT MISTER DE AS HAS COME BEFORE YOU WHEN EXPLAINED IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION WHAT THE PROCESSES IN TERMS OF IO COMPLAINTS SIX CETERA. YET NONE THE LESS TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS EXPLICITLY GIVEN. INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEVEL DATA. ABOUT AS HE SAID DATA DRIVEN INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN IN C. D. C. R. NOT ONLY DID HE NOT DO ANYTHING TO ADDRESS IT HE DIDN'T EVEN FOLLOW. THE VERY PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THIS. BUT THAT HE HAS SET FORTH HERE TODAY HE NEVER REPORTED IT TO THE OEO OFFICE HE NEVER REPORTED IT TO THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS. THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS RIGHT NOW IS WITHIN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL. AFFAIRS AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT THEIR STATISTICS ARE SUCH THAT. OUT OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN SPECIAL AGENTS NINETEEN ARE WOMEN. THERE ARE NO SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE IN THE OFFICE OF INVESTIGATIVE AFFAIRS WHICH. OVERSEAS THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING. IN THE OFFICE OF THE CORRECTIONAL SAFETY. THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE PEACE OFFICERS SIX OF THEM ARE WOMEN. TWO OF THEM ARE SUPERVISORS THAT IS IT AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING DOWN QUICKLY NOT UP. THE PERCENTAGE OF PEACE OFFICERS AND CDC ARE IS 17% BASED ON THEIR OWN STATISTICS AND 5275% OF FEMALE PEACE OFFICERS ARE SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT WOMEN ARE PASSED OVER FOR PROMOTION THERE CHASED OUT FOR DISCRIMINATORY ATTITUDES THEY'RE DENIED ADVANCEMENT AND LIVE WITH REALISTIC FEAR OF RETALIATION. THERE ARE CLEAR BENEFITS TO THE MISSION OF CDC ARE IN THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE TO HAVE GENDER EQUITY AS THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE DEPARTMENT IF THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE DEPARTMENT WERE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE. THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE FEWER HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION CASES WHICH TO DATE HAVE COST THE STATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FURTHER AND MANY MANY STUDIES INCLUDING SOME OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHOW THAT IS THE NUMBER OF FEMALE PEACE OFFICER RISE THE NUMBER OF EXCESSIVE FORCE LAWSUIT TO DROP DRAMATICALLY AGAIN SAVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND RESULTING IN MORE HUMANE TREATMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECTED TO ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT. TO APPROVE MISTER DEALS AT THIS POINT MOMENT IN TIME ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT IS PRESENTED HERE AS HIS PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE HE MENTIONED. GAR WHICH IS THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE FOR RAGE RACIAL RACE AND EQUITY WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS GENDER. HE HAS GIVEN YOU NOTHING NOTHING IN THIS HEARING THAT SHOWS THAT HE IS IN ANY WAY ADDRESSING GENDER IN HIS GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN THIS DEPARTMENT DESPITE HAVING EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND A DAD AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE NUMBERS I'VE GIVEN YOU CLEARLY DATA DRIVEN. THE. TO WE ARE HERE WITH WELL LET ME ALSO JUST SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF RESOURCES OUT THERE AROUND THE GENDER ISSUES. THE ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN EXECUTIVES IN CORRECTION. I DON'T SEE ANY INVOLVEMENT WITH CDC ARE WITH THAT THEY'VE NOT UNTIL THIS YEAR SENT ANY WOMEN TO ANY CONFERENCES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH CORRECTIONS ARE MOVING UP THEY ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HAS TONS OF INFORMATION FOR THEM THE FBI HAS BETTER STATISTICS ABOUT WOMEN AGENTS THAN CDC ARE DOES. THAT SOUND. AS. MISTER DIAZ SAID THAT YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT CAN DO BETTER ON WHO THEY HIRE I THINK THAT JUST SENDING MISTER DE AS IS A NOMINATION ON TO THE SENATE FLOOR MEANS THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS NOT DOING BETTER THAN A CAT SO WE ARE HERE WITH TO ASKS. ONE IS THAT THIS COMMITTEE USAGE STATUTORY AUTHORITY UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION SIX ONE TWO SIX WHICH SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE TO ORDER THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. TO DO AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION ABOUT WOMEN IN CDC ARE. EVEN WITH THIS SUGGESTION THERE'S A CABBIE OP BECAUSE MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE OF. NO Y. G. R. FRIENDS WITH THE OFF PEOPLE AND I A SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A CAREFULLY CHOSEN GROUP. WHO IS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE. I CAN ASK THE SECOND HALF IS THAT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE CONFIRMS ANYONE. FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF CDC ARE THAT THIS COMMITTEE REQUIRE THE CANDIDATE TO PRESENT TO YOU. A VERY SPECIFIC AND FUNDED PLAN TO INCREASE THE RECRUITMENT HIRING PROMOTION AND RETENTION OF. WOMEN IN THE DEPARTMENT AND I CLOSE WITH. JUST THIS. I THINK THAT I WOULD I'M JUST MY CLOSING SENTENCE I WONDER I DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH IN THE WAY OF QUESTIONS OF MISTER DE AS ABOUT THIS ISSUE WHICH I THINK IS CRITICAL AND I HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE TO ASKS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE IT IS WHAT WILL SUPPORT THE WOMEN IN THE DEPARTMENT AND CDC ARE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY. TO KEEP THIS DEPARTMENT GOING AND ARE DENIED THEIR PROMOTIONS AND SUPPORT IN THE DEPARTMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU LET ME RESPOND ON ONE IN TERMS OF OUR- REFERRING. TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL I WOULD SAY. I'M NOT PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION TODAY HOWEVER I HEAR YOUR REQUEST I'M GOING TO REFER THAT. TO OUR SECRETARY AND WE WILL RESPOND TO THAT I WILL RESPOND TO THAT. IS GENERALLY AND SECONDARILY I WOULD SAY. I THINK I THINK ARE SENATE ARE AS A WHOLE AND I THINK THE RULES COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ON. THOROUGHLY HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ABOUT OUR LEVEL OF EXPECTATION. I THINK WE AS I STATED EARLIER. WE DO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY WE'VE HAD TO FACE OURSELVES AND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE HAD TO MAKE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. AND IT WOULD BE REALLY. WRONG OF US NOT TO HOLD YOU TO THAT EXPECTATION AND THE INSTITUTION. A CDC ARE AND I THINK WE HAVE THAT EXPECTATION AND I THINK THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY THROUGH POLICY COMMITTEES THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS AND THROUGH THE COMMITMENT I HAVE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. THAT WE WILL HAVE CONTINUE CONVERSATION SO WE CAN ACTUALLY ACTUALLY MEASURE SUCCESS. BECAUSE OUR AS I SAID IN MY COMMENTS WE HAVE GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS AND VALUES BUT IT IS UP TO US TO MAKE IT REAL. I AND WE ARE PAINFULLY AWARE IN THIS COMMITTEE WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THAT HOUR UPON HOUR UPON HOUR. OF COMMITTEES TO PUT TOGETHER A NEW PROCESS FOR INVESTIGATIONS I. AM COMPELLED PERSONALLY I WASN'T SURE WHO WOULD SHOW UP TODAY TO SPEAK IT I AM NOT UNFAMILIAR WITH PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE HAD SOME CONTENTIOUS HEARINGS IN THE PAST ARE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HEAR PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING AND I THINK WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES WHO TOOK THE TIME TO MEET. OUR WITH THE OPPOSITION. AHA AND TO HEAR IT OUT AND WE WILL TAKE THOSE WE WILL TAKE THOSE COMMENTS I THINK THE HARD. TODAY ARE I WILL SAY I'M ALSO IMPRESSED BY THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION WHO ACTUALLY HAVE COME OUT OF. CDC ARE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO. DID I SAY OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I IT PARTICULARLY A. R. C. AND A NUMBER OF THE FORMER INCARCERATED WHO FEEL COMPELLED TO COME HERE AND SPEAK AND SAY. HOW THEY WERE BENEFITTED THAT IS OUR GOAL THAT IS OUR HOPE AND I'M PRETTY SURE THERE ARE MANY MORE OUT THERE. THAT WE HOPE WILL AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT TODAY I. APPRECIATE EVERYONE WHO CAME I KNOW IT IS YOUR TOM AND WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LISTEN AND TO TAKE THESE ISSUES TO HEART. AND I THINK WE ARE WHETHER YOU WITNESS THAT TODAY I WE HAVE SEEN THE APPOINTMENT SCHEDULE IN ADVANCE AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING. TOWARDS A HEARING THAT TAKES ALL THESE ISSUES INTO ACCOUNT. I A I WILL BE SUPPORT OF TODAY. BECAUSE I'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU I THINK YOU KNOW VERY WELL. YOU HAVE THE BURDEN OF BEING THE LEADER. THAT IS A HEAVY BURDEN. ASA I'M NOT SURE I WOULD WANT YOUR BURDEN BUT. I'M GLAD THAT SOMEONE DOES WE HAVE THE LARGEST PRISON SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. AND IT IS GOING TO BE NO SMALL TASK TO CHANGE CULTURE. WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CULTURE OF OUR MANAGEMENT THE INSTITUTION OR THE GUARDS. AND THAT WILL BE YOUR HIGHEST CHARGE. AND I HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO USE MY ROLE TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE TODAY I INTEND TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S. A APPOINTMENT AND RECOMMENDATION AND WOOD I ENTERTAIN A MOTION. I UNDERSTOOD THAT WAS ALL THE OPPOSITION. MORE OPPOSITION I AND I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD THAT. SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM NINE I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF. YOUR COMMENTS ANA IN KNOWLEDGE ALL THOSE WHO ARE HERE TODAY I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I THINK IN YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS MADAM PRO TEM. THERE HAS BEEN A RECOGNITION TODAY IS NOT A ONE AND DONE I ALSO DID HEAR THE CANDIDATE MISTER DE IS IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION. EIGHT KNOWLEDGE AND COMMIT MOVING FORWARD TO. LOOKING AT DIVERSITY IN GENDER EQUITY IN RECRUITMENT IN RETENTION AND IN PROMOTION. IN THAT COMMITMENT MADE HERE TODAY. IS A COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER ON TO SEE HOW THAT IS. IMPLEMENTED IN MOVES FORWARD IT IS AN AT PLEASURE APPOINTMENT IN WE IN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO HAVE A DUTY OF CONTINUE TO OVERSIGHT ONE OF THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO US THROUGH PENAL CODE SECTION SIXTY ONE TWENTY SIX WOULD BE TO SEEK. AN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL INVESTIGATION I THINK THE PRO TEM HAS ATTRACTED STAFF THROUGH OUR SECRETARY TO EXPLORE THAT POSSIBILITY BUT I THINK AGAIN TODAY'S NOT THE DAY TO MAKE A COMMITMENT OF THAT NATURE I THINK THE COMMITMENT TODAY IS TO WORK TOGETHER TOWARD SHARED IN COMMON OBJECTIVES. AGAIN AS THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH IT IS NOT OUR ROLE TO DIG INTO SUBJECT MATTER THAT IS THE CURRENT SUBJECT OF LITIGATION OUR JUDICIAL BRANCH. IS OVERSEEING THAT. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE COMPLAINANTS ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN WILL HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT ON IN HIM ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT THERE MAY BE A MEDIATION PROCESS. LOOKING FORWARD AND WOULD HOPE THAT WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PARTIES TO FURTHER LOOK NOT ONLY TO THE NATURE OF CURRENT COMPLAINTS BUT TO A PROCESS OF MOVING FORWARD. BY I DO WANT TO THANK THE CANDIDATE FOR. HIS CANDOR AND IN PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR HIS YEARS OF SERVICE AND I THINK BY HIS OWN AND KNOWLEDGE MINT IN IN MISSION THIS IS A HUGE BUREAUCRACY. NOT WITHOUT ITS FAULTS AND DEFECTS IN THE ONLY WAY WE ACHIEVE THE SYSTEM WE WANT THAT CAN CONTINUE. TO RESULT. IN FOR SOME EARLY RELEASE AND ZERO RECIDIVISM SOME OF THESE CITIZENS WHO TESTIFIED TODAY WE NEED TO ASPIRE TO MAKE THE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM A MODEL NOT JUST IN THIS NATION BUT INTERNATIONALLY IN IN TALKING. WITH THE CANDIDATE I KNOW THERE'S SOME INTERNATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT HE'S STUDYING WERE UNIQUE NATION WHERE UNIQUE STATE BUT WHERE WE CAN LEARN FROM THE SUCCESSES OF OTHERS I HEARD AN OPEN MIND THAT WE DON'T HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL THAT WE'RE GONNA. ADAPT AND GROW THIS SYSTEM TO HOPEFULLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES REDUCE THE NUMBER OF RESOURCES AND SUCCEED IN BUILDING A HIGHER LEVEL OF SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION IN LOWER RECIDIVISM SO. KIND OF A LONG PATHWAY TO A MOTION IN SUPPORT OF THIS NOMINATION. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU LET ME JUST RECONFIRM THAT YOU SAID IN YOUR VERY EARLY RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS BUT SENATOR MINING JUST REPEATED THE COMMITMENT AND I JUST WANNA FOR THE RECORD. YOU HEAR YOUR RESPONSE THE COMMITMENT AS IT RELATES I AM FULLY COMMITTED THANK YOU TO THESE TO THESE ISSUES TO MAKE IN THIS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY WITHIN CORRECTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I MUST HAVE AN EQUITABLE AND A WELL BALANCED AND A- GENDER SPECIFIC WORKING GROUP AND IN FLOOR AND DEMAND THAT WE DO BETTER AND THAT WE HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE.

MORE COMPREHENSIVE AS SOLUTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATOR SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR CONSOLIDATIONS. THAT CAN UNLOCK MUCH OF THAT CAPITAL FUNDING. AND WE HAVE A ROBUST I TRACKING IN AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD A TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDS THAT WE DO USE OUR RESULTING IN REAL OUT COMES FOR THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER AND TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR.

A DRAFT TOOL WHICH LOOKS AT THE RISKS THAT COMMUNITIES ARE FACING IN TERMS OF WATER AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S A DRAFT IN IN ITS CONTINUED GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE REFINED BUT IT'S PART OF OUR INITIATIVE TO GET INFORMATION OUT THERE TO UNDERSTAND REALLY THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND WHAT TYPES OF SOLUTIONS WILL WORK YEAH WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. IN TERMS OF CONSOLIDATIONS WHETHER IT'S ACTUAL PHYSICAL CONSOLIDATION SO SYSTEMS OR ITS FUNCTIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE CONSOLIDATIONS YOU KNOW GETTING COMPLETE COMMUNITIES TO WORK TOGETHER ACROSS BROADER GEOGRAPHIES SO THERE'S YOU KNOW A LOT OF OPTIONS THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT AND CERTAINLY THERE'S GONNA BE SOME GROWING PAINS AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOMETIME TO BUILD MOMENTUM.

I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL THINKING TO DO NOW WITH WITH SB TWO HUNDRED AND THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND HOW THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE GOING TO BUILD ANY FALL FROM THERE AND HOW WE CAN ALL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER.

HOW WILL YOU AS BOARD MEMBERS ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATION IS MORE HEAVILY ON ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY RECEIVING ALL THE BENEFITS WHICH IS CLEAN DRINKING WATER WHAT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. IN TERMS OF YOUR DIRECTION TO YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I KNOW A FOR WHEN THAT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF THE- FUNDING THAT CAN BE DIRECTED TOWARDS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. HOWEVER THIS THERE'S A LOT OF WORK INVOLVED WITH THIS IT'S GOING TO INVOLVE. CONTRIBUTIONS FROM YOU KNOW ACROSS OUR STAFF AND ENGAGING WITH CONTRACTORS ENGINEERS CONSULTANTS ACROSS THE STATE FRANKLY TO MAKE THIS COME TO FRUITION. SO IT IS GOING TO HAVE COSTS. THAT BEING SAID THAT THE BILL IS VERY CLEAR ON TRANSPARENCY AND OUR BOARD IS VERY COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY. WITH THE FISCAL EXPENDITURES YOU KNOW WE'RE ALREADY VERY PRACTICE THAT THAT WITH THEIR DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OUR- STATE REVOLVING FIND. PROGRAMS AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WITH SB TWO HUNDRED THERE'LL BE REGULAR REPORTING ON OUR WEBSITE AS TO THE FUNDING EXPENDITURES. A. NOW WHEREAS THE MANY BEEN COMMITTED AND WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT OF THE SUCCESSES THAT WE'RE SEEING. THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE A VERY STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN AND- FUNDING UP FOR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT'S GONNA BE DEVELOPED OVER THE NEXT COMING MONTHS. WHICH IS GOING TO BUILD ON INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY FROM WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE IMPACTED IN TERMS OF HOW BEST. TO USE THESE FUNDS SO. IT THERE'S GIVE ME A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT THERE'S BEEN ACT HIDING ANYTHING THAT ALL THE INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE SHARED AND CERTAINLY. WILL BE LOOKING AT WAYS TO CONTROL COSTS AS. MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE IT'S GETTING TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST. HE THEN MISFIRE STONE YOUR THOUGHTS. YEAH AS. IN MY PRIOR LIFE I A I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS SEEN FRUSTRATION WITH THAT. FROM COMMUNITIES THAT WERE APPLYING FOR FUNDING AND NOT SEEN IT COMING INTO THE COMMUNITY IS THAT HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR AND SOMETIMES DECADES FOR FUNDING NECESSARY TO SOLVE THEIR CHALLENGES AND SO. I AM ACUTELY AWARE OF THAT URGENT NEED TO AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC FUNDING IS GETTING TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO I'M AND THERE IS I FEEL PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FRANKLY FOR MAKING SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM. IS SUCCESSFUL AND RESULTS IN REAL OUT COMES FORWARD THE COMMUNITY IS THAT FRANKLY HELPED FIGHT TO GET THIS FUND TO BEGIN WITH I'M. AND NEED TO BE THE RECIPIENTS OF THE BENEFITS. GREAT WILL THAT ARE KIND OF THIS GREAT SEGUE INTO MY NEXT QUESTION FOR YOU MISS FIRESTONE YOU ARE VIEWED BY SLIMY AND- WITH FLAT FEE THE TENSION THAT GOES ON. IN THE WHOLE WATER WORLD OF FIVE MINISTRATION AND CERTAINLY ON THE R. AG PEOPLE. VERSUS THE CONTROL LET'S PUT ON A WATER FLOW AND ALL OF THAT THROUGH THE- THE VARIOUS WATER OR SEND THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD SANDERS STATE SO SHARE WITH ME AND YOU DID IN THE OFFICE BUT TIED LIKE TO HEAR ON THE- PUBLIC RECORD YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW. YOU WILL HAVING BEEN AN ADVOCATE. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT. OR MENTAL ARE HOW YOU WILL BALANCE. YOUR DECISION MAKING IS NOW PART OF THAT BECAUSE I. JUDICIAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE OF THE BOARD MAKING DECISIONS AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE. DODD DOES DID SHE EVEN AND JOHN. INCORPORATE BALLOT SAY SHE LOOK AT BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUES BECAUSE YOU WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE. OF THE DICE OUT OF THE PUBLIC WITH YOUR THREE MINUTES PROBABLY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OF HER FROM BOARD. SO IT DIE SHARE WITH US ALL OF US ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH. I AS- I HAVE. FOR MUCH OF MY CAREER AND SEEN THE NECESSITY OF REALLY LISTENING TO FOLKS EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THEM AND TRULY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. AND WHERE THERE IS COMMON GROUND WHERE THERE MAY BE UNINTENDED. CONSEQUENCES AND UNDERSTANDING THE TRIM CATION THAT THE. I'M ANY BODY MAKES AND SO NOW THAT I AM IN THIS NEW ROLE I AM VERY COGNIZANT OF THAT OF THE REAL HIGH STAKES FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED THE NEED TO REALLY ENGAGE AND UNDERSTAND. I'M THAT DIFFERENT HAD CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM FIVE PROPOSALS OR DECISIONS IN FRONT OF US. I'M AND. AT I ALSO REALLY BELIEVE IN TRYING TO BUILD TRUST INTO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS SO FOR EXAMPLE AND- THE FEUD DECISION MAKING PROCEEDINGS I'M IN WHICH I WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED I AM RECUSING MYSELF AND NOT PARTICIPATING IN I FEEL IT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TO BUILD A STRONG I'M- THE STRONG SENSE OF TRUST IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND SO EVEN THOUGH I WOULDN'T BE REQUIRED TO I AM I AM AND CHOOSING NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT AS A AND YEAH I'D APPRECIATE THE AS THIS MAJOR CHANGE IN ROLE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT IT BRINGS. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE YOU ARE YOU IN OUR ONE ON ONE CONVERSATION NOW WE'RE VERY CONVINCING ON THAT I THINK I SHARED WITH YOU THEN AS FAR SOME SINCE I NEED TO DOUBLE BACK AND CHECK WITH THE CONSTITUENTS TO RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH ME. TODAY I WILL JUST ABSTAINED BUT BY THE TIME I GET TO THE FLOOR I THINK WE'LL BE COMFORTABLE AND AFTER MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND I THINK THEY MAY HAVE HAD SOME WITH YOU ALSO. SO YOU DO BRING OUR WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE HAVING BEEN ON THAT OTHER SIDE WHERE I USED TO BE BY THE WAY. AND NOW MY CAREER I WAS THE ONE THAT USED TO GO AND BEAT UP ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISOR OVER A LOT OF ISSUES AND THEN I BECAME LAW AND SO IT WAS THAT YOU WITHIN EIGHTEEN TEN AND YOU DO GET A BROADER PERSPECTIVE HAVING SERVED ON BOTH SIDES SO I KNOW THAT YOU BRING THAT. A LAST QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER MCGUIRE IT'S ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THAT VERSES THE WILL REGION REGULATORY APPROACH THAT WAS THROUGH PHASE ONE ON THE WATER FLOW ISSUES AND- THE BAY DELTA AND IF YOU WOULD SHARE WITH US YOUR THOUGHTS ON. VOLUNTARY. VERSUS THE MORE. ARE STRUCTURED. I THINK IF I REMEMBER A YEAR CONVERSATIONS THAT. YOU BELIEVE THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER HE IS PROBABLY A BETTER APPROACH HI AS WE GOING FACE TO. I REMEMBER THAT CORRECTLY AND TO SHARE SOME OF. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT ISSUE DID WITH ME. SURE SB HAPPY TO. SELL YES CERTAINLY THE BAY DELTA WATERSHED HAS BEEN IN THE STATE OF THE CLIENT ECOSYSTEMS BEEN IN DECLINE FOR. SEVERAL DECADES NOW YOU KNOW DESPITE ALL OF OUR- BEST EFFORTS TO TRY AND RESTORE THAT IN TURN TURN THE TIDE. AND HELP RESTORE FISHERIES AND THE ECOSYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW OVER THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS AS A BOARD MEMBER I'VE- TALK TO STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS. BOTH AISLES I'VE TALKED TO ENVIRONMENTAL NGO REPRESENTATIVES OF TALK TO AGRICULTURE I TALKED TO URBAN. WATER SUPPLIERS AND I HAVE YOU KNOW COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT YES INDEED YOU KNOW VOLUNTARY APPROACH TO MANAGING THAT INCREDIBLY COMPLEX WATERS SAID IS YEAH THE PREFERRED AND REALLY. I IN MY MIND ONE OF THE ONLY PASSED THAT WE CAN TAKE FORWARD TO ARRIVE AT MEANINGFUL RESULTS WITHIN AND A NEED A TIME FRAME BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT MY FEAR IS THAT. YOU KNOW IF. THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ARTIST SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD THAT WE'LL FIND OURSELVES AND A PERIOD OF. OF LITIGATION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND FRANKLY THAT DOES NOTHING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT BEING SAID YEAH I DO WANT TO SAY THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT THE SCIENCE YOU KNOW AND THE RIGOR BEHIND THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS IS ABLE TO SHOW. THAT WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS IN PROVIDE REASONABLE PROTECTION FOR OFFICIAL WILDLIFE THAT IS ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND AS A BOARD MEMBER YOU KNOW THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY. TO ENSURE THAT THE BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN REPRESENTS AND WE BELIEVE WILL ACHIEVE THOSE OBJECTIVES SO I AM COMMITTED TO WORK YOU KNOW WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY AND- ACCOMPLISH THOSE. MEANS AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT- I THINK WE CAN GET THERE. WELL YOU'LL HAVE MY SUPPORT I THINK YOU COME FORWARD AND I THINK VERY IMPRESSIVE.
